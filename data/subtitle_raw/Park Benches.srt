1
00:05:33,647 --> 00:05:39,643
''PARK BENCHES''

2
00:06:08,381 --> 00:06:10,941
1 5% off shower nozzles.

3
00:06:11,051 --> 00:06:13,212
2o% off shades
and Japanese screens.

4
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:17,187
5o% off aquariums.
This brochure is for you.

5
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:20,418
2o% off wallpaper
and power jigsaws.

6
00:06:20,527 --> 00:06:24,190
1 5% off melamine shelves
bought in ten installments.

7
00:06:24,297 --> 00:06:26,026
Stop talking nonsense.

8
00:06:26,132 --> 00:06:30,193
No one pays for a shelf
in ten installments.

9
00:06:30,303 --> 00:06:32,032
What are you doing?

10
00:06:32,138 --> 00:06:33,696
What you told us to do,
Mr. Bretelle.

11
00:06:33,807 --> 00:06:36,037
What did l say?

12
00:06:36,142 --> 00:06:38,042
To do street marketing.

13
00:06:38,144 --> 00:06:39,543
Hand out flyers.

14
00:06:39,646 --> 00:06:42,877
You don't do street marketing
at the entrance!

15
00:06:42,982 --> 00:06:46,884
You have to haul them in
from far away.

16
00:06:46,986 --> 00:06:49,546
Come back.
The situation is serious.

17
00:06:49,656 --> 00:06:52,318
We need to refocus fast.

18
00:06:56,329 --> 00:06:58,889
Not again.

19
00:06:58,998 --> 00:07:00,226
lt says ''Brico-Dram.''

20
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:03,393
l can see that.
This is the third time.

21
00:07:03,503 --> 00:07:04,902
l've had it.

22
00:07:05,004 --> 00:07:07,495
All hell's
going to break loose!

23
00:07:41,407 --> 00:07:42,965
How about this?

24
00:07:43,076 --> 00:07:47,240
Shaded terrace, oceanfront...
6,ooo a week.

25
00:07:47,347 --> 00:07:49,076
Not bad.

26
00:07:49,182 --> 00:07:51,082
6,ooo euros!

27
00:07:51,184 --> 00:07:54,847
Who can relax
after shelling out 6,ooo?

28
00:08:01,227 --> 00:08:02,285
Come on!

29
00:08:02,395 --> 00:08:06,161
He looks like
a premature ejaculator.

30
00:08:06,266 --> 00:08:08,257
Show me.

31
00:08:11,171 --> 00:08:13,002
She's right.

32
00:08:22,115 --> 00:08:23,673
Simon!

33
00:08:23,783 --> 00:08:25,011
Lucie,

34
00:08:25,118 --> 00:08:28,849
you get a brownie point.

35
00:08:28,955 --> 00:08:30,616
Remi double-checked.

36
00:08:30,723 --> 00:08:32,623
The profit margin
wasn't included

37
00:08:32,725 --> 00:08:34,784
for November and December.

38
00:08:34,894 --> 00:08:38,295
- October too.
- Yes, exactly.

39
00:08:38,398 --> 00:08:43,062
l came to give you money
for Mrs. Renivelle's gift.

40
00:08:49,742 --> 00:08:52,472
Down the hatch!

41
00:08:52,579 --> 00:08:54,638
What is it?

42
00:08:54,747 --> 00:08:55,645
Very original.

43
00:08:55,748 --> 00:08:57,739
We had a nice idea.

44
00:08:57,851 --> 00:08:59,250
Expensive?

45
00:08:59,352 --> 00:09:00,751
Life companions.

46
00:09:00,854 --> 00:09:03,186
Very good.

47
00:09:07,193 --> 00:09:09,593
You know, Lucie,

48
00:09:09,696 --> 00:09:13,598
when l see your serious face
behind this screen,

49
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:17,101
l know you're goofing off.

50
00:09:17,203 --> 00:09:19,603
''The cicada sang
all summer long,

51
00:09:19,706 --> 00:09:23,039
and got her year-end objectives
all wrong.''

52
00:09:28,047 --> 00:09:29,605
What an ass...

53
00:09:29,716 --> 00:09:31,274
This damn lamp.

54
00:09:31,384 --> 00:09:34,217
- Tighten the screw.
- l do, nonstop.

55
00:09:37,223 --> 00:09:40,556
Maybe the fish shouldn't stay
in the dark.

56
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:24,302
''LONELY MAN''

57
00:10:30,543 --> 00:10:33,944
Well, l'll be.

58
00:10:34,047 --> 00:10:36,515
What's this bullshit?

59
00:10:36,616 --> 00:10:39,107
lt may not be bullshit.

60
00:10:41,621 --> 00:10:44,089
lt's a load of crap.

61
00:10:49,529 --> 00:10:51,588
A message in a bottle.

62
00:10:51,698 --> 00:10:54,599
Maybe it's a call for help.

63
00:10:54,701 --> 00:10:57,761
Too bad.
He forgot to give his number.

64
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:00,532
lt's the old solitude routine.

65
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,700
All alone in the big city.
Pure theatrics.

66
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,209
Who knows?

67
00:11:05,311 --> 00:11:07,541
He may kill himself.
Let's do something.

68
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,636
Easy does it.

69
00:11:08,748 --> 00:11:09,806
Cool down.

70
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:12,646
lt's a sex thing.
He wants to hook up.

71
00:11:12,752 --> 00:11:14,549
We should get a banner.

72
00:11:14,654 --> 00:11:16,849
''Lonely women for man.''

73
00:11:16,956 --> 00:11:18,685
ldiot!

74
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:22,386
lf we wrote ''lonely women,''
we'd be called sluts.

75
00:11:25,365 --> 00:11:26,923
And our objectives?

76
00:11:27,033 --> 00:11:29,593
The big boss called today.

77
00:11:29,702 --> 00:11:32,762
We need to finalize...

78
00:11:32,872 --> 00:11:34,772
''Lonely man.''

79
00:11:34,874 --> 00:11:40,278
What the hell is this hoax?

80
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,439
Some guy marketing himself.

81
00:11:42,548 --> 00:11:47,508
lt's a teaser.
''Appetease'' our appetites.

82
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,781
Not a bad idea.

83
00:11:49,889 --> 00:11:52,449
What's he selling?

84
00:11:52,558 --> 00:11:55,891
A book, a movie...
a band?

85
00:11:55,995 --> 00:11:57,963
Would you do it...

86
00:11:58,064 --> 00:11:59,622
if you were alone?

87
00:11:59,732 --> 00:12:03,964
Pathetic.
Whining in public.

88
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:07,471
Back to work.

89
00:12:11,711 --> 00:12:14,441
''Solitude...

90
00:12:14,547 --> 00:12:17,778
is shared with oneself.''

91
00:12:17,884 --> 00:12:21,786
Says Krachberg.

92
00:12:21,888 --> 00:12:23,116
That's it.

93
00:12:23,222 --> 00:12:26,623
The guy just got dumped.
lt's obvious.

94
00:12:26,726 --> 00:12:28,455
Anger externalization.

95
00:12:28,561 --> 00:12:30,961
He's targeting his ex-wife.

96
00:12:31,064 --> 00:12:33,464
She must be able
to see the banner.

97
00:12:33,566 --> 00:12:38,663
Maybe she works in our building.
Maybe here.

98
00:12:38,771 --> 00:12:42,104
Got an extra paper clip?

99
00:12:47,046 --> 00:12:49,014
He could be good-looking.

100
00:12:49,115 --> 00:12:50,912
We should...

101
00:12:51,017 --> 00:12:54,509
Maybe he wants a friend.
We're being awful!

102
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:57,851
He wants a woman.
lt's like a personal ad.

103
00:12:57,957 --> 00:13:01,188
Not with those colors.
All that black.

104
00:13:01,294 --> 00:13:03,524
Like a tombstone.

105
00:13:03,629 --> 00:13:06,792
He's at the end of his rope!
He can't cope!

106
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:08,526
Yell to him you're coming.

107
00:13:08,634 --> 00:13:09,828
How stupid.

108
00:13:09,936 --> 00:13:13,167
Too easy.
Your family's waiting for you.

109
00:13:13,272 --> 00:13:14,830
So l can cook them dinner.

110
00:13:14,941 --> 00:13:16,841
- You're lucky.
- Don't be dumb.

111
00:13:16,943 --> 00:13:19,002
You're clueless
about living alone.

112
00:13:19,112 --> 00:13:23,173
Eating shredded carrots straight
from the plastic carton.

113
00:13:23,282 --> 00:13:25,341
Cooking just one egg.

114
00:13:25,451 --> 00:13:27,783
Canned beef stew
in front of the TV.

115
00:13:27,887 --> 00:13:29,718
You eat beef stew?

116
00:13:29,822 --> 00:13:34,384
Buying four vanilla yogurts
and eating all four.

117
00:13:34,494 --> 00:13:36,086
Spare us the grocery list.

118
00:13:36,195 --> 00:13:37,594
You idiot!

119
00:13:37,697 --> 00:13:39,597
Got to go.

120
00:13:39,699 --> 00:13:41,860
Hello, ladies.

121
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:51,435
What's so funny?

122
00:13:51,544 --> 00:13:54,445
He wants a fuck.
That's all.

123
00:13:54,547 --> 00:13:57,209
Okay, get out of here.
Beat it.

124
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,650
- Making progress?
- You bet!

125
00:14:03,756 --> 00:14:06,486
l mean,
any news from Banner Boy?

126
00:14:06,592 --> 00:14:08,583
No news.

127
00:14:13,032 --> 00:14:15,592
Because l was thinking...

128
00:14:15,701 --> 00:14:19,603
lt may be a publicity stunt,
but who knows?

129
00:14:19,705 --> 00:14:21,605
He may blow his brains out.

130
00:14:21,707 --> 00:14:23,004
Maybe he's already dead.

131
00:14:24,944 --> 00:14:26,275
Simon, here you are.

132
00:14:26,379 --> 00:14:28,779
Where are Borelly's stats?

133
00:14:28,881 --> 00:14:31,782
l was just asking Lucie
if she...

134
00:14:31,884 --> 00:14:34,045
- What were you looking at?
- Nothing.

135
00:14:45,431 --> 00:14:48,491
Simon, concerning
Borelly's trader buzz,

136
00:14:48,601 --> 00:14:53,334
maybe we should...

137
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,838
Did you see it?

138
00:14:54,941 --> 00:14:57,000
What?

139
00:14:57,109 --> 00:14:58,770
The banner?

140
00:14:58,878 --> 00:15:00,937
Sure, l saw it.

141
00:15:01,047 --> 00:15:03,277
What can l say?

142
00:15:03,382 --> 00:15:07,443
lt's pretty drab,
color-wise.

143
00:15:07,553 --> 00:15:08,611
Has anyone gone to check?

144
00:15:08,721 --> 00:15:10,382
No.

145
00:15:20,032 --> 00:15:22,592
l doubt he did it
just for fun.

146
00:15:22,702 --> 00:15:24,761
Should we send someone?

147
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,929
Volunteers
can go during lunch.

148
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:29,599
ln two and a half hours.
Fine.

149
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:32,769
Okay, go now,
but Renivelle mustn't notice.

150
00:15:32,878 --> 00:15:34,106
Excellent.

151
00:15:34,213 --> 00:15:35,612
You're obviously not going.

152
00:15:35,715 --> 00:15:36,773
Obviously.

153
00:15:36,882 --> 00:15:38,611
Just Lucie, of course.

154
00:15:38,718 --> 00:15:40,117
She can't go alone.

155
00:15:40,219 --> 00:15:43,120
We can't all go.
Come on.

156
00:15:43,222 --> 00:15:46,123
Borelly arrives at 1 1 :oo.
We have work.

157
00:15:46,225 --> 00:15:48,125
Lucie,
don't use my corridor.

158
00:15:48,227 --> 00:15:51,628
But Solange may see her.

159
00:15:51,731 --> 00:15:53,631
l'll keep her busy.

160
00:15:53,733 --> 00:15:56,896
Go out separately
in five minutes.

161
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:22,122
Solange...

162
00:16:22,228 --> 00:16:24,162
come with me.

163
00:16:24,263 --> 00:16:30,202
l want a status report.

164
00:16:30,303 --> 00:16:32,032
Over a cup of coffee.

165
00:16:32,138 --> 00:16:33,162
Let's go.

166
00:16:33,272 --> 00:16:35,832
A coffee, now?
lt's 9:5o.

167
00:16:35,941 --> 00:16:37,738
Now.

168
00:16:37,843 --> 00:16:41,244
l'm doing Mr. Borelly's
PowerPoint.

169
00:16:41,347 --> 00:16:42,837
Now.

170
00:17:02,001 --> 00:17:04,060
Such big cartridges.

171
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:07,765
Careful.
That's watercress soup.

172
00:17:07,873 --> 00:17:09,238
You okay?

173
00:17:09,342 --> 00:17:11,173
Yes.

174
00:17:12,678 --> 00:17:16,409
Borelly's visit
isn't simplifying things.

175
00:17:16,515 --> 00:17:18,676
l left you a memo
on Axel-Bust.

176
00:17:18,784 --> 00:17:21,275
One step at a time.

177
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:28,859
How's your little dog?

178
00:17:28,961 --> 00:17:30,189
Still nibbling?

179
00:17:30,296 --> 00:17:32,355
Sorry about your phone.

180
00:17:32,465 --> 00:17:35,866
But it was really tiny.
She swallowed it whole.

181
00:17:35,968 --> 00:17:38,562
l heard it ringing.
l had to wait...

182
00:17:38,671 --> 00:17:40,730
The vibrating alert
sped up the...

183
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,035
Enough.
You can keep it.

184
00:17:43,142 --> 00:17:44,109
Like yesterday.

185
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:46,269
l was having
a simple TV dinner.

186
00:17:46,379 --> 00:17:48,847
l went to get some parmesan.

187
00:17:48,948 --> 00:17:50,779
l got back.
No more carbonara.

188
00:17:50,883 --> 00:17:54,478
She ate my carbonara
in a flash.

189
00:17:57,022 --> 00:17:58,751
Who did what?

190
00:17:58,858 --> 00:18:00,086
Fluffy.
My carbonara.

191
00:18:00,192 --> 00:18:04,424
l'm sorry.
Of course...

192
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:07,090
How long since
your husband died?

193
00:18:07,199 --> 00:18:08,427
Six years.

194
00:18:08,534 --> 00:18:11,264
And since?

195
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:13,804
You live alone?

196
00:18:13,906 --> 00:18:17,034
lt has its advantages.

197
00:18:17,143 --> 00:18:19,873
l've gone places
he'd never have gone.

198
00:18:19,979 --> 00:18:21,537
China.

199
00:18:21,647 --> 00:18:23,877
A cruise tracing
Saint Paul's footsteps.

200
00:18:23,983 --> 00:18:27,248
Scuba diving
in the South Seas.

201
00:18:27,353 --> 00:18:30,254
Millions of little fish,
so friendly,

202
00:18:30,356 --> 00:18:34,053
escorting you to the surface.

203
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,219
And now that
l'm about to retire...

204
00:18:36,328 --> 00:18:37,727
Exactly.

205
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,730
lf you were home alone,

206
00:18:39,832 --> 00:18:42,892
at the end of your rope,
desperate,

207
00:18:43,002 --> 00:18:44,401
what would you do?

208
00:18:44,503 --> 00:18:47,563
No idea!
But it won't be the case.

209
00:18:47,673 --> 00:18:50,733
Such sadness means
you've known great joy.

210
00:18:50,843 --> 00:18:53,869
But no banner for me,
if that's your question.

211
00:18:53,979 --> 00:18:55,207
You saw it too.

212
00:18:55,314 --> 00:19:00,377
Everyone's talking about it.
Ridiculous.

213
00:19:00,486 --> 00:19:03,216
What if it's serious?

214
00:19:03,322 --> 00:19:06,382
l've never seen you like this.
Don't worry.

215
00:19:06,492 --> 00:19:07,550
l'm not!

216
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:10,185
That banner
is a leftist thing.

217
00:19:10,296 --> 00:19:13,356
He's typically some kind of...

218
00:19:13,466 --> 00:19:16,867
some kind of...
hippie-type.

219
00:19:16,969 --> 00:19:18,937
A real subversive.

220
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:21,097
lt's very heavy-duty stuff!

221
00:19:21,207 --> 00:19:24,938
No, that's
cream of asparagus.

222
00:19:25,044 --> 00:19:29,276
He's watching us and thinking,
''Three for the price of one!''

223
00:19:30,749 --> 00:19:34,742
Shit.
An intercom!

224
00:19:34,854 --> 00:19:37,914
Odile de la Touze,
Mr. and Mrs. de Brichembard...

225
00:19:38,023 --> 00:19:40,423
Eliminate the couples.

226
00:19:40,526 --> 00:19:43,586
''H.S.'' as in ''heartsick.''

227
00:19:46,665 --> 00:19:48,895
Anyway,
l was Highly Skeptical.

228
00:19:49,001 --> 00:19:50,730
Mermot?

229
00:19:50,836 --> 00:19:52,269
There's a Bemol.

230
00:19:52,371 --> 00:19:54,931
His name is Bemol!

231
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,632
What is it?

232
00:19:56,742 --> 00:20:00,473
We're going to the fourth floor.
Can you open up?

233
00:20:00,579 --> 00:20:02,638
Want my PlN code too?

234
00:20:02,748 --> 00:20:05,615
Haven't you seen
the banner up there?

235
00:20:05,718 --> 00:20:06,742
Butt out!

236
00:20:06,852 --> 00:20:08,410
Screw you, old fart.

237
00:20:08,521 --> 00:20:10,580
Wait till the next heat wave!

238
00:20:10,689 --> 00:20:11,917
Calm down.

239
00:20:12,024 --> 00:20:13,082
Excuse me.

240
00:20:13,192 --> 00:20:15,922
Perfect timing.
We want to go in.

241
00:20:16,028 --> 00:20:16,926
To see who?

242
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:18,428
lt's for the banner.

243
00:20:18,531 --> 00:20:20,089
Up there.

244
00:20:20,199 --> 00:20:23,430
What banner?

245
00:20:23,536 --> 00:20:25,595
l don't know him.

246
00:20:25,704 --> 00:20:27,604
- Don't you care?
- Not at all.

247
00:20:27,706 --> 00:20:30,607
ln a small town,
this would be unheard of.

248
00:20:30,709 --> 00:20:32,108
l come from one.
So?

249
00:20:32,211 --> 00:20:35,112
Where l come from,
we know each other.

250
00:20:35,214 --> 00:20:36,613
We help each other.

251
00:20:36,715 --> 00:20:38,774
We have block parties.

252
00:20:38,884 --> 00:20:40,351
We have potluck dinners.

253
00:20:40,452 --> 00:20:41,851
Enough, Amandine.

254
00:20:41,954 --> 00:20:43,512
He may die all alone!

255
00:20:43,622 --> 00:20:45,180
Spare me.
l'll let you in.

256
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:48,590
Hurry up,
before he jumps.

257
00:20:51,363 --> 00:20:53,263
Why are you laughing?

258
00:20:53,365 --> 00:20:54,764
He may be hot stuff.

259
00:20:54,867 --> 00:20:55,925
No way.

260
00:20:56,035 --> 00:20:58,765
lf he hung that banner,
he's ugly.

261
00:20:58,871 --> 00:21:01,032
He must have a major flaw.

262
00:21:07,379 --> 00:21:10,109
Are you the lonely man?

263
00:21:10,215 --> 00:21:12,445
l'm not the only one.

264
00:21:12,551 --> 00:21:14,314
Do you live here?

265
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,819
No, but l'm a doctor.

266
00:21:15,921 --> 00:21:17,616
l live nearby.
Want a drink?

267
00:21:17,723 --> 00:21:19,782
At 1 o:oo a.m.?

268
00:21:19,892 --> 00:21:22,554
No rest for the wicked.

269
00:21:25,064 --> 00:21:27,294
You talk to a guy,
and you're...

270
00:21:27,399 --> 00:21:29,128
A slut.

271
00:21:29,234 --> 00:21:31,225
lt should be this one.

272
00:21:38,377 --> 00:21:39,275
Try again.

273
00:21:39,378 --> 00:21:41,107
Wait.

274
00:21:41,213 --> 00:21:43,943
Anyway,
we have his name.

275
00:21:44,049 --> 00:21:45,607
Mermot.

276
00:21:45,718 --> 00:21:48,278
- Mermoz?
- Mermot!

277
00:21:48,387 --> 00:21:50,287
Could be
the gladiator's son!

278
00:21:50,389 --> 00:21:52,380
Aviator, idiot!

279
00:22:03,168 --> 00:22:04,897
He's rummaging about.

280
00:22:05,004 --> 00:22:08,235
Keep quiet!

281
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,399
Gag or tragedy?

282
00:22:10,509 --> 00:22:14,070
ls it a matter of love
or a matter of death?

283
00:22:14,179 --> 00:22:16,238
Hello, ma'am.

284
00:22:16,348 --> 00:22:18,509
Do you know who lives here?

285
00:22:18,617 --> 00:22:22,849
He won't open up for you.
So what?

286
00:22:22,955 --> 00:22:25,856
Does a caretaker or a super
have the keys?

287
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:27,016
Snooper?

288
00:22:27,126 --> 00:22:29,356
A super.
A caretaker.

289
00:22:29,461 --> 00:22:31,691
There will be no more
caretakers.

290
00:22:31,797 --> 00:22:33,856
No more snoopers.

291
00:22:33,966 --> 00:22:35,194
No more neighbors.

292
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,962
No more lonely men.

293
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:40,129
Lonely man,
lonely man,

294
00:22:40,239 --> 00:22:42,969
you shall always
cherish the sea.

295
00:22:43,075 --> 00:22:45,566
Shit, l'm talking gibberish.

296
00:22:50,883 --> 00:22:52,111
Excuse me.

297
00:22:52,217 --> 00:22:55,277
Your neighbor's banner,
''Lonely man.''

298
00:22:55,387 --> 00:22:56,411
Did you see it?

299
00:22:56,522 --> 00:22:57,614
What do you want?

300
00:22:57,723 --> 00:23:00,521
Your neighbor
may kill himself.

301
00:23:00,626 --> 00:23:04,084
He wants to blow his nuts off?
Let him.

302
00:23:04,196 --> 00:23:06,187
lnstead of your pathetic
sob stories,

303
00:23:06,298 --> 00:23:07,526
if l may,

304
00:23:07,633 --> 00:23:10,329
think about what's going on
in the world.

305
00:23:10,436 --> 00:23:12,996
Our soldiers
fighting in Syldavia.

306
00:23:13,105 --> 00:23:16,074
Africa. The famine.
Not to mention Colombia.

307
00:23:16,175 --> 00:23:17,767
Yes, don't mention it.

308
00:23:17,876 --> 00:23:19,104
l used to hear

309
00:23:19,211 --> 00:23:22,544
''Forget about your neighbors,
think of Bosnia!''

310
00:23:22,648 --> 00:23:23,876
Now the opposite.

311
00:23:23,982 --> 00:23:26,473
Forget politics,
think of your neighbor.

312
00:23:26,585 --> 00:23:28,746
Do you know who lives there?

313
00:23:35,427 --> 00:23:39,090
We already had a suicide
on the fifth floor.

314
00:23:39,198 --> 00:23:40,961
The third floor!

315
00:23:41,066 --> 00:23:43,159
Not dead,
just maimed.

316
00:23:43,268 --> 00:23:44,667
Terribly.

317
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:48,171
But since the plastic surgery,
his face is nicer.

318
00:23:48,273 --> 00:23:52,505
He always looks amazed.
He used to be so serious.

319
00:23:52,611 --> 00:23:54,670
lt's a big difference.

320
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:59,046
But the doctors winged it.
They had no photo.

321
00:24:01,086 --> 00:24:03,077
Bunch of lunatics!

322
00:24:12,197 --> 00:24:15,030
We'll go back in
separately...

323
00:24:16,502 --> 00:24:18,834
So?

324
00:24:23,408 --> 00:24:25,569
Dial zero to get out.

325
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:34,050
You've reached 91 1 .
Please hold on.

326
00:24:34,153 --> 00:24:36,053
An operator
will take your call.

327
00:24:36,155 --> 00:24:37,713
Hello, officer.

328
00:24:37,823 --> 00:24:40,883
We're in Rue de Noailles,
and we can see,

329
00:24:40,993 --> 00:24:45,362
hanging from the fourth floor
across the street, a banner,

330
00:24:45,464 --> 00:24:48,695
white letters
on a black background:

331
00:24:48,801 --> 00:24:50,029
''Lonely man.''

332
00:24:50,135 --> 00:24:51,693
''Lonely man,''
yes.

333
00:24:51,804 --> 00:24:53,704
We knocked.
No answer.

334
00:24:53,806 --> 00:24:55,034
Like he's not there.

335
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,198
He was rummaging!

336
00:24:56,308 --> 00:24:58,401
My friend said
he rummaged about.

337
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:00,137
Lonely man in search of...?

338
00:25:00,245 --> 00:25:01,803
Nothing.
We don't know.

339
00:25:01,914 --> 00:25:03,643
lt just says, ''Lonely man.''

340
00:25:03,749 --> 00:25:07,344
We can't help
if we don't know what he wants.

341
00:25:07,452 --> 00:25:08,885
You won't do anything?

342
00:25:08,987 --> 00:25:11,046
What if he jumps
out the window?

343
00:25:11,156 --> 00:25:13,215
You're facing his building.

344
00:25:13,325 --> 00:25:14,690
lf he goes onto the ledge,

345
00:25:14,793 --> 00:25:19,321
call us discreetly
and try to make him wait.

346
00:25:19,431 --> 00:25:21,661
Great idea.
What exactly should l say?

347
00:25:21,767 --> 00:25:23,029
Anything.

348
00:25:23,135 --> 00:25:27,196
But avoid trigger-terms:
happiness,

349
00:25:27,306 --> 00:25:29,365
prospects, tenderness,

350
00:25:29,474 --> 00:25:31,374
hope, second chance.

351
00:25:31,476 --> 00:25:32,408
Good luck.

352
00:25:32,511 --> 00:25:34,570
''Good luck''
would be heavy-handed.

353
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:38,343
l said it to you.
Good luck.

354
00:25:44,389 --> 00:25:45,481
No one cares.

355
00:25:50,829 --> 00:25:54,856
Once more,
new objectives mean

356
00:25:54,967 --> 00:25:56,525
betting on a new direction.

357
00:25:56,635 --> 00:25:58,694
lncreasing market share.

358
00:25:58,804 --> 00:26:04,367
As evidenced here,
in this slide.

359
00:26:04,476 --> 00:26:06,706
We're number one.

360
00:26:06,812 --> 00:26:08,939
Simply because
we have the best products.

361
00:26:09,047 --> 00:26:13,814
Our target is very
''top-qual.''

362
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,250
Next slide.

363
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:23,050
One moment, please.

364
00:26:24,296 --> 00:26:27,356
Bitch.
Bimbo.

365
00:26:27,466 --> 00:26:30,162
Limbo.
Never stay in limbo.

366
00:26:30,269 --> 00:26:32,965
So once whore...

367
00:26:33,071 --> 00:26:35,972
Once more,
and l can't repeat it enough,

368
00:26:36,074 --> 00:26:39,475
new objectives mean
betting on a new erection.

369
00:26:39,578 --> 00:26:41,478
New direction.

370
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,480
lncreasing market share.

371
00:26:43,582 --> 00:26:46,483
As evidenced here,

372
00:26:46,585 --> 00:26:49,247
in this sleaze.

373
00:27:01,166 --> 00:27:04,226
Of course,
there are different strategies.

374
00:27:04,336 --> 00:27:06,861
Blow job
is not worth doing,

375
00:27:06,972 --> 00:27:09,497
and analysis lets us
invaginate...

376
00:27:09,608 --> 00:27:13,203
envisage what
the competition will use

377
00:27:13,312 --> 00:27:16,372
as a long-sperm strategy.

378
00:27:16,481 --> 00:27:18,472
We can't stay like this,

379
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:21,814
dependent on
the fluctuations above 1 5%,

380
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,649
especially if rates drop.

381
00:27:23,755 --> 00:27:25,916
So if we...

382
00:27:29,928 --> 00:27:33,489
lf we weigh
the differential by 2%,

383
00:27:33,598 --> 00:27:39,002
we'll be spared having to bear
the cunt of the cock market--

384
00:27:39,104 --> 00:27:41,504
brunt of the stock market.

385
00:27:41,606 --> 00:27:44,700
Since we know
his name and address,

386
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:47,540
we can find his number
on the net.

387
00:27:47,646 --> 00:27:49,637
Let's go.

388
00:28:02,694 --> 00:28:05,993
- l may ask you to leave.
- Listen to her!

389
00:28:06,098 --> 00:28:07,156
Answer phone.

390
00:28:07,265 --> 00:28:09,665
This is your
correspondent's voicemail.

391
00:28:09,768 --> 00:28:12,999
Leave a message
after the beep.

392
00:28:13,105 --> 00:28:16,336
Hello.
Sorry to bother you.

393
00:28:16,441 --> 00:28:22,175
We're worried about you,

394
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,339
about your banner.

395
00:28:24,449 --> 00:28:27,850
So if you could
call us back,

396
00:28:27,953 --> 00:28:31,684
we'd appreciate it.

397
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:37,353
Are you a lonely man,
or is it just an act?

398
00:28:37,462 --> 00:28:40,124
l won't give my name.
You don't give yours.

399
00:28:40,232 --> 00:28:44,293
But here's my number:
o6 99...

400
00:28:44,403 --> 00:28:47,736
- No cell?
- lt doesn't say.

401
00:28:57,516 --> 00:29:00,076
Hello!

402
00:29:00,185 --> 00:29:03,245
Ah, it's you.

403
00:29:03,355 --> 00:29:07,257
l'll check.

404
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:09,418
Yeah, l do.

405
00:29:09,528 --> 00:29:14,431
Don't get worked up,
Mother.

406
00:29:14,533 --> 00:29:17,434
No.

407
00:29:17,536 --> 00:29:18,434
Yes.

408
00:29:18,537 --> 00:29:20,937
You're already
in Versailles.

409
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,939
Fine.

410
00:29:23,041 --> 00:29:26,033
l'll meet you at the park.

411
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,509
Monthly drill.

412
00:29:30,615 --> 00:29:35,075
These sirens freak me out.

413
00:30:27,005 --> 00:30:28,563
You idiot.

414
00:30:28,673 --> 00:30:30,504
You idiot!

415
00:30:49,794 --> 00:30:50,852
Sleep well?

416
00:30:50,896 --> 00:30:53,330
Still the same minor pain.

417
00:31:06,244 --> 00:31:10,340
You open with a lovers' leap.

418
00:31:10,448 --> 00:31:13,349
You'll roll
a three and a one.

419
00:31:13,451 --> 00:31:17,945
l call that
a very good omen.

420
00:31:18,056 --> 00:31:20,286
You know what
Jean-Pierre Marielle says.

421
00:31:20,392 --> 00:31:22,189
Jean-Pierre Marielle?

422
00:31:22,294 --> 00:31:24,524
''At 5o, if you wake up
in the morning

423
00:31:24,629 --> 00:31:28,121
with no pain,
then you're dead.''

424
00:31:28,233 --> 00:31:29,291
Well put.

425
00:31:29,401 --> 00:31:30,459
When's your colo?

426
00:31:30,569 --> 00:31:31,968
Colo?

427
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,628
Ah, my colonoscopy!

428
00:31:33,738 --> 00:31:36,468
ln a week.
lt's my fifth one.

429
00:31:36,575 --> 00:31:40,807
lt's very common now.

430
00:31:40,912 --> 00:31:44,575
ln any case,
from the age of 5o,

431
00:31:44,683 --> 00:31:47,345
life is a series
of colonoscopies.

432
00:31:47,452 --> 00:31:49,283
Marielle again?

433
00:31:49,387 --> 00:31:50,820
No, that's Duras.

434
00:31:50,922 --> 00:31:53,823
Marguerite?

435
00:31:53,925 --> 00:31:55,153
Really?

436
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,728
Still so gullible!

437
00:31:57,829 --> 00:32:00,297
We've written
masterpieces,

438
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:04,164
built bridges,
harvested tons of wheat,

439
00:32:04,269 --> 00:32:06,499
taught thousands
of children,

440
00:32:06,605 --> 00:32:10,974
but at 5o,
the colonoscopies start.

441
00:32:11,076 --> 00:32:14,307
Then you take your nice car,
your bus,

442
00:32:14,412 --> 00:32:17,870
your shopping bag,
and head off to your 6os.

443
00:32:17,983 --> 00:32:20,042
When you get there,
if you're lucky,

444
00:32:20,151 --> 00:32:23,882
another colonoscopy.

445
00:32:23,989 --> 00:32:25,718
What's funny is that

446
00:32:25,824 --> 00:32:29,692
speaking like this with a friend
isn't sad.

447
00:32:29,794 --> 00:32:32,024
lt's life.

448
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:36,191
Even though it's horrible.

449
00:32:36,301 --> 00:32:38,030
Yes.

450
00:32:38,136 --> 00:32:39,694
Another brandy?

451
00:32:39,804 --> 00:32:41,533
l'd love it.

452
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:45,701
l have potato chips,
if you want.

453
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:49,906
- Excellent!
- You like them.

454
00:32:58,356 --> 00:33:00,415
Sleep, baby.

455
00:33:03,361 --> 00:33:07,764
Don't worry.
We're here.

456
00:33:07,866 --> 00:33:10,357
We're on the lookout.

457
00:33:24,115 --> 00:33:26,606
He looks troubled.

458
00:33:27,686 --> 00:33:29,916
What did war teach you?

459
00:33:30,021 --> 00:33:32,581
To partake
in life's pleasures.

460
00:33:32,691 --> 00:33:35,751
l eat, l drink, l breathe.
l sleep at ease.

461
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:38,260
Small things barely worry me.

462
00:33:38,363 --> 00:33:40,524
What else did war teach you?

463
00:33:40,632 --> 00:33:43,032
To love wide shoes
and soft collars.

464
00:33:43,134 --> 00:33:50,540
To abandon the bourgeois habit
of external trappings.

465
00:33:50,642 --> 00:33:51,870
Can l take your chair?

466
00:33:51,976 --> 00:33:53,409
Definitely not.

467
00:33:53,511 --> 00:33:55,911
l can't take the chair?

468
00:33:56,014 --> 00:33:59,074
l thought you wanted
a cigarette.

469
00:33:59,184 --> 00:34:00,913
How are you?

470
00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:02,748
Hello.

471
00:34:02,854 --> 00:34:03,786
Hello?

472
00:34:03,888 --> 00:34:06,618
Lounging in the sun?

473
00:34:06,725 --> 00:34:08,124
What class were you?

474
00:34:08,226 --> 00:34:11,127
1 992.

475
00:34:11,229 --> 00:34:13,629
Mrs. Derfuche.

476
00:34:13,732 --> 00:34:15,791
You don't remember?

477
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,731
My hood down to here.

478
00:34:17,836 --> 00:34:21,397
Dunce caps too.

479
00:34:21,506 --> 00:34:23,235
You were a real pain.

480
00:34:23,341 --> 00:34:26,401
- Yeah, l still am.
- l can see.

481
00:34:26,511 --> 00:34:28,570
l annoyed you nicely.

482
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:31,240
Just like now.

483
00:34:31,349 --> 00:34:33,749
You never cracked a smile!

484
00:34:33,852 --> 00:34:37,754
Back then, when you put
the cow's eye in my pocket,

485
00:34:37,856 --> 00:34:40,154
l wasn't amused.

486
00:34:40,258 --> 00:34:41,350
Remember that?

487
00:34:41,459 --> 00:34:44,019
The rest too.

488
00:34:46,197 --> 00:34:47,095
And you?

489
00:34:47,198 --> 00:34:52,295
l ''do-you-speak-English''
nonstop!

490
00:34:52,404 --> 00:34:54,463
We studied song lyrics.

491
00:34:54,572 --> 00:34:59,407
With your chalky fingers,
you'd stop Donovan in mid-song.

492
00:35:09,053 --> 00:35:11,886
California?
How ridiculous!

493
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:21,997
Funny, l thought
it was about California.

494
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,796
With songs,
only the sound remains.

495
00:35:24,903 --> 00:35:28,703
What do you do now?

496
00:35:28,807 --> 00:35:32,038
Same as usual, odd jobs.
Free as a bird.

497
00:35:32,143 --> 00:35:35,374
You'll laugh.

498
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,879
l'm a ghost,

499
00:35:36,981 --> 00:35:39,745
in ghost trains at town fairs.

500
00:35:39,851 --> 00:35:41,250
l travel around.

501
00:35:41,352 --> 00:35:43,081
That's good.

502
00:35:43,188 --> 00:35:44,712
l'm really scary.

503
00:35:44,823 --> 00:35:48,224
Come with your grandkids,
if you want.

504
00:35:48,326 --> 00:35:51,727
l won't scare them too bad.

505
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:55,493
l'll let you go.
l want to finish my show.

506
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,728
See you, Mrs. Derfuche.

507
00:35:58,837 --> 00:36:01,032
Good-bye...

508
00:36:01,139 --> 00:36:02,800
Thierry.

509
00:36:02,907 --> 00:36:05,705
- Good-bye, Thierry.
- See you soon.

510
00:36:07,912 --> 00:36:09,971
Yeah, right.

511
00:36:10,081 --> 00:36:13,573
What else
did the war teach you?

512
00:36:16,588 --> 00:36:19,989
As dangerous as they may be,
we can count on them.

513
00:36:20,091 --> 00:36:21,820
What else
did the war teach you?

514
00:36:21,926 --> 00:36:24,588
That nothing is more useful
to man than man,

515
00:36:24,696 --> 00:36:27,927
and nothing is better for man
than man.

516
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,260
Three tablets a day,

517
00:36:29,367 --> 00:36:34,270
six in case of pain
but no more than six a day.

518
00:36:34,372 --> 00:36:37,273
l want us to tend
to each other, but no.

519
00:36:37,375 --> 00:36:40,435
Life is terrible,
and we sleep and sleep.

520
00:36:40,545 --> 00:36:44,606
But if we don't stay awake,
our dreams become nightmares

521
00:36:44,716 --> 00:36:47,742
and our children's lives,
terrible.

522
00:36:57,462 --> 00:37:00,022
He gets out of bed
at 3:oo p.m.

523
00:37:00,131 --> 00:37:03,692
He'll live at home
till he's 4o.

524
00:37:03,801 --> 00:37:06,201
Chatting online all day.

525
00:37:06,304 --> 00:37:10,365
Hasn't fucked a girl yet!

526
00:37:10,475 --> 00:37:13,035
Lost in virtual reality.

527
00:37:13,144 --> 00:37:15,374
Virtual reality
isn't half bad.

528
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,210
Babying him
turned him into a jackass.

529
00:37:18,316 --> 00:37:19,544
But he's not untalented.

530
00:37:19,651 --> 00:37:21,710
But he won't be a cop,

531
00:37:21,819 --> 00:37:23,343
won't go in the army.

532
00:37:23,454 --> 00:37:24,853
Says it's degrading.

533
00:37:24,956 --> 00:37:27,686
These kids think
they're geniuses.

534
00:37:27,792 --> 00:37:31,023
He doesn't want anything.

535
00:37:31,129 --> 00:37:36,192
Shoes, clothes.
He couldn't care less.

536
00:37:36,301 --> 00:37:39,168
He just wants
computer equipment.

537
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:40,828
She buys it for him.

538
00:37:40,939 --> 00:37:43,169
She's happy.

539
00:37:43,274 --> 00:37:46,334
When he was 1 8,
she didn't want him in my car.

540
00:37:46,444 --> 00:37:50,676
A real mother hen.
She'll sit on him till he's 45.

541
00:37:50,782 --> 00:37:53,774
Sit on her son?

542
00:37:55,286 --> 00:37:57,186
Like a hen!

543
00:37:57,288 --> 00:37:59,347
That's how society is now.

544
00:37:59,457 --> 00:38:03,188
lt's too easy
to blame it on society.

545
00:38:03,294 --> 00:38:05,694
You work, period!

546
00:38:05,797 --> 00:38:07,856
You work!

547
00:38:07,966 --> 00:38:10,696
You work.

548
00:38:10,802 --> 00:38:15,205
You work to...
to make a living.

549
00:38:15,306 --> 00:38:18,207
But people get fed up.

550
00:38:18,309 --> 00:38:20,709
We may strike a new balance.

551
00:38:20,812 --> 00:38:22,803
Unawares.

552
00:38:30,288 --> 00:38:32,984
So l attached her wawa
to her binkie.

553
00:38:33,091 --> 00:38:36,993
Now she looks for binkie
and finds wawa!

554
00:38:37,095 --> 00:38:40,030
- What's that ball?
- lt's wonderful.

555
00:38:40,131 --> 00:38:41,860
lt's a learning ball.

556
00:38:41,966 --> 00:38:44,025
lt introduces children
to sounds.

557
00:38:44,135 --> 00:38:46,035
There are different kinds.

558
00:38:46,137 --> 00:38:47,365
By pressing on them,

559
00:38:47,472 --> 00:38:50,635
kids learn to prioritize
pitch and volume.

560
00:38:57,582 --> 00:39:01,575
Too bad they can't prioritize
a little more.

561
00:39:21,572 --> 00:39:23,631
Why are you bald on top?

562
00:39:23,741 --> 00:39:26,403
Get lost!

563
00:39:29,914 --> 00:39:32,314
Here you are!

564
00:39:32,417 --> 00:39:35,079
Come kiss your mother.

565
00:39:45,229 --> 00:39:47,220
Kid, come here!

566
00:39:49,967 --> 00:39:53,869
Chocolate pudding?

567
00:39:53,971 --> 00:39:56,701
- ls that your mom?
- With Grandma.

568
00:39:56,808 --> 00:39:58,435
Where's your daddy?

569
00:39:58,543 --> 00:40:01,774
He left Mom for a guy
when my sister was born.

570
00:40:01,879 --> 00:40:03,437
That's good.

571
00:40:03,548 --> 00:40:06,608
What do you mean?

572
00:40:06,718 --> 00:40:08,276
l'll make you a plane.

573
00:40:08,386 --> 00:40:11,116
You like planes?

574
00:40:11,222 --> 00:40:12,951
Why are you being nice now?

575
00:40:13,057 --> 00:40:15,958
l was always nice.

576
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:18,290
Your mommy seems nice.

577
00:40:18,396 --> 00:40:19,454
What's her name?

578
00:40:19,564 --> 00:40:23,295
Lucie.

579
00:40:23,401 --> 00:40:24,959
l'll give you a kiss.

580
00:40:25,069 --> 00:40:27,128
And you give it to her

581
00:40:27,238 --> 00:40:29,798
without saying
it came from me.

582
00:40:29,907 --> 00:40:32,239
Okay?

583
00:40:35,246 --> 00:40:38,306
Why didn't you give me Yop
before?

584
00:40:38,416 --> 00:40:40,145
lt wasn't Yop.

585
00:40:40,251 --> 00:40:42,412
Beat it.

586
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:04,171
Another one.

587
00:41:15,319 --> 00:41:19,221
- Know what Sacha Guitry said?
- He said...

588
00:41:19,323 --> 00:41:22,315
l'd like more potato chips.

589
00:41:26,898 --> 00:41:28,923
''Observing a person asleep

590
00:41:29,033 --> 00:41:31,763
is like opening a letter
meant for someone else.''

591
00:41:31,869 --> 00:41:36,431
That wasn't Cocteau?

592
00:41:36,541 --> 00:41:40,272
ln La Bruyere, a man confuses
dice cup and wine glass

593
00:41:40,378 --> 00:41:42,938
and waters the game.

594
00:41:43,047 --> 00:41:45,538
l should reread Characters.

595
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:47,982
lt's very amusing.

596
00:42:08,806 --> 00:42:11,969
What the hell?

597
00:42:25,223 --> 00:42:27,885
Bitch!

598
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:35,328
What time is it?

599
00:42:35,433 --> 00:42:37,663
1 :1 2!

600
00:42:37,768 --> 00:42:39,759
No problem, then.

601
00:42:42,907 --> 00:42:45,467
Hey, Gramps, got a smoke?

602
00:42:45,576 --> 00:42:46,804
My last one.

603
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:51,314
l'll take a few puffs
and give it to you.

604
00:42:51,415 --> 00:42:54,316
Go on, stop bargaining.
Play!

605
00:42:54,418 --> 00:42:58,252
Everyone bargains now,
even in jacquet.

606
00:42:58,356 --> 00:43:00,256
Not jacquet.
Backgammon.

607
00:43:00,358 --> 00:43:01,757
We're playing backgammon.

608
00:43:01,859 --> 00:43:03,087
Shut up, Gramps.

609
00:43:03,194 --> 00:43:04,752
Throw the dice.

610
00:43:04,862 --> 00:43:08,093
Give chance a chance.
That's important in life.

611
00:43:08,199 --> 00:43:11,532
You look a bit
like Jean Poiret.

612
00:43:15,706 --> 00:43:17,264
Yeah, Jean Poiret.

613
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:19,605
Sublime Jean Poiret!

614
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:22,270
He and Serrault
were incredible.

615
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:24,109
Where are you?

616
00:43:24,215 --> 00:43:27,446
Poiret and Serrault!

617
00:43:27,551 --> 00:43:29,109
Where are they?

618
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:31,313
Jospin, give us a break!

619
00:43:31,422 --> 00:43:34,653
Shut up!

620
00:43:34,759 --> 00:43:37,227
How does she know my name?

621
00:43:40,197 --> 00:43:43,564
Without TV at night,
l'd go mad.

622
00:43:43,668 --> 00:43:45,568
You wouldn't do like him,

623
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:47,228
a ''Lonely woman'' banner.

624
00:43:47,338 --> 00:43:49,238
l mean my insomnia.

625
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:51,069
lt's not connected?

626
00:43:51,175 --> 00:43:56,078
Would you care about moose
if you had a man in your bed?

627
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:59,741
Sorry.

628
00:43:59,850 --> 00:44:02,114
Do animals have insomnia?

629
00:44:02,219 --> 00:44:03,948
The night birds.

630
00:44:04,055 --> 00:44:06,285
Bats.

631
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:08,358
You know about fruit bats?

632
00:44:08,459 --> 00:44:10,017
l'm all ears.

633
00:44:10,127 --> 00:44:12,857
Pallas' long-tongued bat
lives in Ecuador,

634
00:44:12,964 --> 00:44:14,363
in the Andes.

635
00:44:14,465 --> 00:44:17,332
lf it wants to,
it can lick its feet.

636
00:44:17,435 --> 00:44:19,232
l can also lick my...

637
00:44:19,337 --> 00:44:20,736
Without leaning over.

638
00:44:20,838 --> 00:44:23,238
lts tongue is 1 5o% longer
than its body.

639
00:44:23,341 --> 00:44:25,332
- How tall is it?
- 9o millimeter.

640
00:44:25,443 --> 00:44:28,003
lt's tiny.

641
00:44:28,112 --> 00:44:31,309
lt can lick the floor.

642
00:44:45,763 --> 00:44:47,162
l'm a funk.

643
00:44:47,264 --> 00:44:50,028
Punk, not funk.
A punk's not a soldier.

644
00:44:50,134 --> 00:44:52,534
My grandpa
fought a world war

645
00:44:52,636 --> 00:44:55,696
and the Algerian world war
and Vietnam.

646
00:44:55,806 --> 00:44:57,171
He shot with a AA-52.

647
00:44:57,274 --> 00:44:59,174
My grandpa loved his sister.

648
00:44:59,276 --> 00:45:01,506
Marianne,
don't repeat that!

649
00:45:01,612 --> 00:45:04,672
- Let's play magic tunnel.
- No, war!

650
00:45:04,782 --> 00:45:07,512
- What's magic tunnel?
- lt's that tunnel.

651
00:45:07,618 --> 00:45:09,017
lt goes to the castle.

652
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:12,681
To enter, you have to tell
the guard a nice secret.

653
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:14,189
lf l tell you,
l go in?

654
00:45:14,291 --> 00:45:16,350
lt's a secret just for me.

655
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:19,520
l'll decapitate your legs
and go in anyway.

656
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:22,463
l'll whack you
till you piss blood!

657
00:45:22,566 --> 00:45:25,296
Mind your tongue!

658
00:45:25,403 --> 00:45:27,633
Her brother's influence.

659
00:45:27,738 --> 00:45:30,969
My son has no brother,
no TV in the house...

660
00:45:31,075 --> 00:45:32,702
Where does he get it from?

661
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:34,209
What happens in the tunnel?

662
00:45:34,311 --> 00:45:36,211
We go and make love.

663
00:45:36,313 --> 00:45:38,873
l'll tell you a secret then.

664
00:45:38,983 --> 00:45:40,883
l go first!

665
00:45:40,985 --> 00:45:42,213
You don't want to!

666
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:43,877
Yeah, l go first.

667
00:45:43,988 --> 00:45:48,857
Okay, then.
l'm listening.

668
00:45:48,959 --> 00:45:50,859
l have a nice secret for you.

669
00:45:50,961 --> 00:45:52,019
Shut up!
My turn!

670
00:45:52,129 --> 00:45:54,359
Arthur!
Speak nicely!

671
00:45:54,465 --> 00:45:56,023
Television...

672
00:45:56,133 --> 00:45:58,124
But we don't have
a television!

673
00:46:03,207 --> 00:46:04,435
That's your nice secret?

674
00:46:04,542 --> 00:46:05,770
- Yes.
- lt's dumb.

675
00:46:05,876 --> 00:46:06,774
What did he say?

676
00:46:06,877 --> 00:46:08,504
Quiet!
l'll hit you!

677
00:46:08,612 --> 00:46:09,943
Shut up!

678
00:46:10,047 --> 00:46:11,275
Mom, Arthur said...

679
00:46:11,382 --> 00:46:12,940
Shut up!
Bitch!

680
00:46:13,050 --> 00:46:14,779
Arthur, enough!

681
00:46:14,885 --> 00:46:16,944
- What did you tell her?
- Nothing.

682
00:46:17,054 --> 00:46:18,112
l won't say.

683
00:46:18,222 --> 00:46:20,315
lf you do,
l'll never speak to you.

684
00:46:20,424 --> 00:46:22,688
You won't be my friend
anymore.

685
00:46:22,793 --> 00:46:24,852
l have a nice secret
for you.

686
00:46:24,962 --> 00:46:26,691
The game's over.

687
00:46:26,797 --> 00:46:29,027
- What did he say?
- lt's a secret.

688
00:46:29,133 --> 00:46:30,691
You can tell us now.

689
00:46:30,801 --> 00:46:32,530
He went away.

690
00:46:32,636 --> 00:46:36,197
No.
lt was a secret for me.

691
00:46:36,307 --> 00:46:39,037
Good girl.
You're right not to say it.

692
00:46:39,143 --> 00:46:42,135
Not many people
can keep a secret.

693
00:47:41,338 --> 00:47:43,329
Sorry.

694
00:47:56,153 --> 00:47:57,882
What was your secret?

695
00:47:57,988 --> 00:47:59,546
l won't say.

696
00:47:59,657 --> 00:48:01,716
You won't say?

697
00:48:01,825 --> 00:48:04,988
Good.
You can play.

698
00:48:28,619 --> 00:48:32,521
lt's nice doing nothing.

699
00:48:32,623 --> 00:48:35,956
You say it
like it's unusual.

700
00:48:39,129 --> 00:48:41,859
l need to buy a diary.

701
00:48:41,966 --> 00:48:45,527
Me too.

702
00:48:45,636 --> 00:48:50,266
Lots of good TV shows,
so l need a diary.

703
00:48:52,943 --> 00:48:56,003
ls that a sparrow there?

704
00:48:56,113 --> 00:48:58,775
Just relax.

705
00:49:01,685 --> 00:49:04,176
- May l?
- Of course.

706
00:49:24,475 --> 00:49:26,534
l don't care.

707
00:49:26,644 --> 00:49:28,475
Whatever.

708
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:31,138
You're alone.
You're alone...

709
00:49:31,248 --> 00:49:34,479
You're not alone to be alone.

710
00:49:34,585 --> 00:49:36,985
Everyone's alone.
l'm alone too.

711
00:49:37,087 --> 00:49:39,647
l'm all alone.

712
00:49:39,757 --> 00:49:41,315
But l take care of myself.

713
00:49:41,425 --> 00:49:43,985
l keep on cooking
for myself.

714
00:49:44,094 --> 00:49:46,824
l dress very well.
l go out at night.

715
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:48,488
l cajole myself.

716
00:49:48,599 --> 00:49:50,499
l said, l cajole myself!

717
00:49:50,601 --> 00:49:54,503
Sometimes l sing
''Happy Birthday to Me.''

718
00:49:54,605 --> 00:49:57,665
l'm hypersensitive.
You know me.

719
00:49:57,775 --> 00:50:00,335
Hypersensitive,
open to everything,

720
00:50:00,444 --> 00:50:03,004
to whatever comes along,

721
00:50:03,113 --> 00:50:05,673
to the cloth
on a beautiful woman's skin.

722
00:50:05,783 --> 00:50:08,843
l have to see you.
We have to talk.

723
00:50:08,952 --> 00:50:12,513
You can't sneak off!
Come!

724
00:50:12,623 --> 00:50:14,352
l know it's over.

725
00:50:14,458 --> 00:50:17,120
l need one more caress.

726
00:50:19,363 --> 00:50:21,923
You said our hearts
were hand grenades.

727
00:50:22,032 --> 00:50:24,262
What counts
is pulling the pin.

728
00:50:24,368 --> 00:50:26,768
With you,
l already pulled my pin.

729
00:50:26,870 --> 00:50:29,771
l'll explode all alone
in this park!

730
00:50:29,873 --> 00:50:32,103
l love canned peas too.

731
00:50:32,209 --> 00:50:34,439
Canned, because
l like sopping up

732
00:50:34,545 --> 00:50:37,412
the juice in the can.

733
00:50:37,514 --> 00:50:39,914
So tell me face-to-face!

734
00:50:40,017 --> 00:50:42,417
Do l have to come get you?

735
00:50:42,519 --> 00:50:45,079
Men are such cowards!

736
00:50:45,189 --> 00:50:46,417
l should have known.

737
00:50:46,523 --> 00:50:49,924
The way you picked me up
was so underhanded.

738
00:50:50,027 --> 00:50:52,757
All innuendos
and insinuations.

739
00:50:52,863 --> 00:50:55,423
Now you're hinting
it's over?

740
00:50:55,532 --> 00:50:58,092
Bastard!

741
00:50:58,202 --> 00:51:00,602
The first guy l see
with some daring,

742
00:51:00,704 --> 00:51:04,265
l'm following him home!

743
00:51:04,375 --> 00:51:07,276
Picard's frozen food
is good.

744
00:51:07,378 --> 00:51:08,936
l really like Picard.

745
00:51:09,046 --> 00:51:12,277
They do a great creme brulee.

746
00:51:12,383 --> 00:51:14,283
And they deliver,
which is cool.

747
00:51:14,385 --> 00:51:17,445
Or else it melts
in the shopping bag.

748
00:51:17,554 --> 00:51:19,886
Hold on.

749
00:51:21,892 --> 00:51:24,986
We got cut off.

750
00:51:27,231 --> 00:51:29,131
Hello.

751
00:51:29,233 --> 00:51:30,791
lf you said,
''Sleep with me,''

752
00:51:30,901 --> 00:51:33,301
l'd say yes
on the double.

753
00:51:33,404 --> 00:51:35,964
l won't be saying it.

754
00:51:36,073 --> 00:51:38,303
Then l say no.

755
00:51:38,409 --> 00:51:39,637
No what?

756
00:51:39,743 --> 00:51:42,473
You won't sleep with me.

757
00:51:42,579 --> 00:51:44,137
Exactly.

758
00:51:44,248 --> 00:51:46,478
Out of the question,
anyway.

759
00:51:46,583 --> 00:51:47,481
Why?

760
00:51:47,584 --> 00:51:48,983
You won't say it.

761
00:51:49,086 --> 00:51:50,644
Absolutely.

762
00:51:50,754 --> 00:51:52,312
lt's out of the question.

763
00:51:52,423 --> 00:51:54,323
Not even a question.

764
00:51:54,425 --> 00:51:55,483
What question?

765
00:51:55,592 --> 00:51:57,651
Stop it!

766
00:51:57,761 --> 00:52:00,491
You want to make me talk,
say things.

767
00:52:00,597 --> 00:52:02,827
- What things?
- Stop, l said!

768
00:52:02,933 --> 00:52:04,332
Nothing, that's all!

769
00:52:04,435 --> 00:52:05,493
Relax...

770
00:52:05,602 --> 00:52:08,162
''Nothing'' is better
than nothing.

771
00:52:08,272 --> 00:52:11,173
lt's already something.

772
00:52:11,275 --> 00:52:12,833
Honestly.

773
00:52:12,943 --> 00:52:14,501
You find me daring?

774
00:52:14,611 --> 00:52:16,306
Aren't l frank?

775
00:52:16,413 --> 00:52:17,812
Frankly dumb!

776
00:52:17,915 --> 00:52:19,644
Really, really dumb!

777
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:22,651
A stupid little pony
who can't stop jerking his tail!

778
00:52:22,753 --> 00:52:24,653
Guys and their
pathetic plotting.

779
00:52:24,755 --> 00:52:30,990
You want flattery,
then do your vanishing act.

780
00:52:31,094 --> 00:52:33,494
You wage wars
to dazzle us,

781
00:52:33,597 --> 00:52:36,828
and we roam the battlefields,
playing nurse!

782
00:52:36,934 --> 00:52:38,834
We toil away,
and you come back,

783
00:52:38,936 --> 00:52:40,164
no arms, no cock!

784
00:52:40,270 --> 00:52:41,464
And we mother you!

785
00:52:41,572 --> 00:52:43,199
- Cool it!
- Beat it!

786
00:52:43,307 --> 00:52:44,535
Cannon fodder!

787
00:52:44,641 --> 00:52:46,700
- You beat it too.
- Beat it!

788
00:52:46,810 --> 00:52:48,869
Beat it, okay?

789
00:52:48,979 --> 00:52:50,037
Got a minute?

790
00:52:50,147 --> 00:52:53,548
You beat it too.

791
00:52:53,650 --> 00:52:55,311
What the hell?

792
00:52:55,419 --> 00:52:57,148
Thanks a lot
for calling me.

793
00:52:57,254 --> 00:52:58,482
What did she say?

794
00:52:58,589 --> 00:53:01,149
She called me a pony
and a cannon fodder.

795
00:53:01,258 --> 00:53:02,486
A cannon fodder?

796
00:53:02,593 --> 00:53:04,151
- What's that?
- No idea.

797
00:53:04,261 --> 00:53:07,162
''Cannon fodder.''

798
00:53:07,264 --> 00:53:10,324
You think wars are nice?

799
00:53:10,434 --> 00:53:13,835
Very nice!

800
00:53:13,937 --> 00:53:15,666
Keep it up.

801
00:53:15,772 --> 00:53:18,832
Bunch of losers!

802
00:53:18,942 --> 00:53:21,274
Starboard!

803
00:53:39,396 --> 00:53:41,796
l'm in a rush.
Borelly's here.

804
00:53:41,899 --> 00:53:44,367
- And this banner...
- l'm glad you came.

805
00:53:44,468 --> 00:53:45,799
Me too.
l'm glad l came.

806
00:53:54,678 --> 00:53:57,340
Why don't you have a boat?

807
00:54:03,353 --> 00:54:06,413
How did your interviews go?

808
00:54:06,523 --> 00:54:10,084
Nothing.
No offers.

809
00:54:10,193 --> 00:54:13,924
Why not?

810
00:54:14,031 --> 00:54:16,090
l don't work,

811
00:54:16,199 --> 00:54:18,064
because l can't.

812
00:54:18,168 --> 00:54:19,499
At least you're free.

813
00:54:19,603 --> 00:54:23,505
Don't tell me that.

814
00:54:23,607 --> 00:54:26,098
Yes, but you are.

815
00:54:32,449 --> 00:54:38,183
l feel like
nothing's tangible.

816
00:54:38,288 --> 00:54:41,280
l'm living in limbo.

817
00:54:45,429 --> 00:54:47,488
Be frank.

818
00:54:47,598 --> 00:54:49,657
Are you in love?

819
00:54:49,766 --> 00:54:51,427
With me, l mean.

820
00:54:51,535 --> 00:54:54,095
No.

821
00:54:54,204 --> 00:54:56,104
Why do you say no?

822
00:54:56,206 --> 00:54:58,697
l'm not anymore.

823
00:55:00,711 --> 00:55:02,611
Were you in love?

824
00:55:02,713 --> 00:55:06,444
Yes, but not any longer.

825
00:55:06,550 --> 00:55:09,781
That means
you were never in love.

826
00:55:11,555 --> 00:55:13,887
Not true.

827
00:55:16,293 --> 00:55:18,193
You know when it happened?

828
00:55:18,295 --> 00:55:19,990
Be frank.

829
00:55:20,097 --> 00:55:22,327
Dinner with Bazille.

830
00:55:22,432 --> 00:55:25,833
You described the sunset
with a sound.

831
00:55:25,936 --> 00:55:28,166
Why the noise?

832
00:55:28,271 --> 00:55:30,501
The sun doesn't dart around.

833
00:55:30,607 --> 00:55:32,541
Life's not a cartoon.

834
00:55:32,643 --> 00:55:35,806
At first,
l found you so funny.

835
00:55:39,116 --> 00:55:42,608
l like cartoons.

836
00:55:54,164 --> 00:55:57,622
How will l live
without your scent?

837
00:56:00,303 --> 00:56:04,706
l'll do something
l've never done with you.

838
00:56:04,808 --> 00:56:07,971
A forced sign of affection.

839
00:56:08,078 --> 00:56:10,569
But l'll do it.

840
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:38,772
We can be so soppy.

841
00:56:42,112 --> 00:56:45,013
''ARE YOU OKAY?''

842
00:56:49,352 --> 00:56:51,912
What are you doing?

843
00:56:52,022 --> 00:56:53,580
As you can see,

844
00:56:53,690 --> 00:56:56,750
to remove graffiti,
they need a report.

845
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:59,556
l'm filling it out.

846
00:56:59,663 --> 00:57:01,324
Over here too.

847
00:57:03,366 --> 00:57:06,062
''FAT WHORE''

848
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:32,351
Okay, back to work now.

849
00:58:43,466 --> 00:58:45,366
A splash of Fishcool
in the tank,

850
00:58:45,468 --> 00:58:47,026
and soon enough,

851
00:58:47,137 --> 00:58:51,039
your finned friends
will sparkle and shine.

852
00:58:51,141 --> 00:58:54,042
Once their protective mucus
is restored,

853
00:58:54,144 --> 00:58:56,374
your discreet lodgers
will regain

854
00:58:56,479 --> 00:58:59,141
their balance and harmony.

855
00:59:04,321 --> 00:59:07,381
Fishcool, the answer
to aquatic equanimity.

856
00:59:07,490 --> 00:59:10,482
A splash of Fishcool
in the tank...

857
00:59:27,711 --> 00:59:29,110
Where were you?

858
00:59:29,212 --> 00:59:32,443
Street marketing
in the park.

859
00:59:32,549 --> 00:59:34,107
The park!

860
00:59:34,217 --> 00:59:36,447
That way.

861
00:59:36,553 --> 00:59:38,783
You guys are my staff.

862
00:59:38,889 --> 00:59:40,618
Don't forget it.

863
00:59:40,724 --> 00:59:44,421
l need you to raise standards.

864
00:59:44,527 --> 00:59:45,994
Raymond, are you carrying?

865
00:59:46,096 --> 00:59:49,497
Romain.
Sure l am.

866
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:51,157
Once more, kids.

867
00:59:51,268 --> 00:59:54,931
New objectives mean...

868
00:59:57,941 --> 01:00:00,171
Easy does it!

869
01:00:00,277 --> 01:00:04,338
Betting on a new direction.
lncreasing market share.

870
01:00:04,447 --> 01:00:07,280
Paul,
temporarily turn it down.

871
01:00:10,954 --> 01:00:15,357
Our target
is very ''top-qual.''

872
01:00:15,458 --> 01:00:17,688
We have no more room
for stock.

873
01:00:17,794 --> 01:00:20,024
So what's our strength?

874
01:00:20,130 --> 01:00:23,531
Service!

875
01:00:27,003 --> 01:00:28,061
Raymond, please.

876
01:00:28,171 --> 01:00:30,731
- My name's Romain.
- Romain, sorry.

877
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:32,740
Moreover,
we're overstaffed,

878
01:00:32,842 --> 01:00:35,470
you know,
in relation to our potential.

879
01:00:35,578 --> 01:00:37,671
So be aggressive.
Go and bite!

880
01:00:37,781 --> 01:00:40,477
None of you is a real shark.

881
01:00:43,453 --> 01:00:46,183
You, Maurice,
your name is Maurice Bejart,

882
01:00:46,289 --> 01:00:48,018
so give them
a song and dance!

883
01:00:48,124 --> 01:00:50,456
Get it?

884
01:00:51,494 --> 01:00:53,325
No.

885
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:58,489
Just a banner?

886
01:00:58,601 --> 01:01:01,832
Yes, and it says,
''Lonely man.''

887
01:01:01,938 --> 01:01:03,667
What huge batteries!

888
01:01:03,773 --> 01:01:07,436
lt's for Mega-Spresso,
the coffee machine.

889
01:01:20,824 --> 01:01:24,385
Ultramarine blue.
Mother, it may not be a boy!

890
01:01:24,494 --> 01:01:26,052
And blue is sad.

891
01:01:26,162 --> 01:01:28,062
lt won't be a monkey,
so why those branches?

892
01:01:28,164 --> 01:01:29,893
Such ugly wallpaper!

893
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,902
That's why it's on sale.

894
01:01:34,004 --> 01:01:35,904
There are pretty things.

895
01:01:36,006 --> 01:01:39,066
They have crappy taste.
See their aprons?

896
01:01:39,175 --> 01:01:40,904
A little whimsy is nice.

897
01:01:41,011 --> 01:01:44,071
lf that's whimsy,
l'm shooting myself.

898
01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:46,910
- Don't talk nonsense.
- l'm not.

899
01:01:47,017 --> 01:01:48,644
Understand me...

900
01:01:48,752 --> 01:01:51,983
lf the customer follows you,
he's interested.

901
01:01:52,088 --> 01:01:53,646
For example,

902
01:01:53,757 --> 01:01:57,318
if you bend over for a product,
and he does too,

903
01:01:57,427 --> 01:01:59,588
the battle's won.

904
01:02:09,105 --> 01:02:11,335
Soft wood?

905
01:02:11,441 --> 01:02:13,841
l don't know.

906
01:02:13,943 --> 01:02:16,104
lt's wood...

907
01:02:22,118 --> 01:02:26,521
Carbonic steel
or cobalt steel?

908
01:02:26,623 --> 01:02:30,354
For making holes, right?

909
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:32,860
Holes.
Normal holes.

910
01:02:32,962 --> 01:02:35,487
- Take a twist bit.
- Why?

911
01:02:35,598 --> 01:02:40,592
lts Morse taper shank is perfect
for removing shavings.

912
01:02:51,381 --> 01:02:54,441
42 euros!

913
01:02:54,551 --> 01:02:57,452
lt seems fine.

914
01:02:57,554 --> 01:03:01,217
l'll take it.

915
01:03:04,527 --> 01:03:08,429
Could Raffarin's daddy
please come to Customer Service?

916
01:03:08,531 --> 01:03:12,194
l'd like to see
your portable drills.

917
01:03:16,372 --> 01:03:19,432
Remember to make
special offer alerts.

918
01:03:19,542 --> 01:03:20,440
Fight!

919
01:03:20,543 --> 01:03:21,475
Yes, yes.

920
01:03:21,578 --> 01:03:23,808
Everyone asks
how much goldfish cost.

921
01:03:23,913 --> 01:03:26,313
We don't sell fish.
He put them back.

922
01:03:26,416 --> 01:03:28,145
Aime!
Where is he?

923
01:03:28,251 --> 01:03:30,913
l'll shove his fish...

924
01:03:37,694 --> 01:03:42,563
You better stop.
Bretelle's watching.

925
01:03:42,665 --> 01:03:44,826
You find that funny?

926
01:03:44,934 --> 01:03:46,663
Not at all.

927
01:03:46,769 --> 01:03:51,672
l prefer Marsupilami's tail.

928
01:03:51,774 --> 01:03:53,674
Yes?

929
01:03:53,776 --> 01:03:56,336
l need a one-handle faucet.

930
01:03:56,446 --> 01:03:58,175
One-handle faucets.
This way.

931
01:03:58,281 --> 01:04:01,011
Down this aisle,
straight ahead...

932
01:04:01,117 --> 01:04:03,847
After the lightbulbs,
turn right,

933
01:04:03,953 --> 01:04:06,615
past the pumps,
and all the way down.

934
01:04:09,425 --> 01:04:10,983
Opportune...

935
01:04:11,094 --> 01:04:12,493
Service alert.
Call Raymond.

936
01:04:12,595 --> 01:04:14,825
Help that guy.
He's confused.

937
01:04:14,931 --> 01:04:17,161
Sales clerk
wanted in faucets!

938
01:04:17,267 --> 01:04:19,997
Cool it!

939
01:04:20,103 --> 01:04:21,502
Like on an airplane.

940
01:04:21,604 --> 01:04:24,664
Smooth voice.
Sugarcoat the customers.

941
01:04:24,774 --> 01:04:28,005
l'll sugarcoat...

942
01:04:28,111 --> 01:04:34,016
Talk with a smile.

943
01:04:34,117 --> 01:04:38,611
A sales clerk is wanted
in one-handled faucets.

944
01:04:40,023 --> 01:04:41,422
Hello, sir.

945
01:04:41,524 --> 01:04:43,924
You're taking all three?

946
01:04:44,027 --> 01:04:45,927
Give him a Loyalty Card.

947
01:04:46,029 --> 01:04:47,826
Of course.

948
01:04:59,609 --> 01:05:01,008
l was right.

949
01:05:01,110 --> 01:05:04,170
Not potable.
Like it says.

950
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:07,943
The test is conclusive.

951
01:05:08,051 --> 01:05:11,111
Tell me,
it's not too...

952
01:05:11,221 --> 01:05:12,779
Too?

953
01:05:12,889 --> 01:05:17,292
What's the word?

954
01:05:17,393 --> 01:05:21,796
My house isn't a bunker.

955
01:05:21,898 --> 01:05:24,458
lt's not reinforced concrete.

956
01:05:24,567 --> 01:05:27,297
That drill works
on all kinds of walls.

957
01:05:27,403 --> 01:05:29,303
Load-bearing walls,
flimsy partitions,

958
01:05:29,405 --> 01:05:32,568
concrete...

959
01:05:32,675 --> 01:05:35,371
lt's the bit.

960
01:05:39,382 --> 01:05:40,781
Careful...

961
01:05:40,883 --> 01:05:42,612
- lf you please?
- lf you please.

962
01:05:42,719 --> 01:05:46,280
lt's a thin partition
but a big headache.

963
01:05:46,389 --> 01:05:49,119
l want to attack it
well-armed,

964
01:05:49,225 --> 01:05:52,126
if you follow me.

965
01:05:52,228 --> 01:05:55,288
l don't want to bore
right through it.

966
01:05:55,398 --> 01:05:58,629
l thought you were
knocking it down.

967
01:05:58,735 --> 01:06:01,966
That's one of
the possibilities.

968
01:06:02,071 --> 01:06:06,132
For the time being,
l can't decide.

969
01:06:06,242 --> 01:06:11,145
No, no, no.

970
01:06:11,247 --> 01:06:12,475
lf you please...

971
01:06:12,582 --> 01:06:14,812
lt's best
that you ask my colleague.

972
01:06:14,917 --> 01:06:17,977
He sent me to you.
He didn't know.

973
01:06:18,087 --> 01:06:20,146
- What?
- A screw anchor.

974
01:06:20,256 --> 01:06:21,814
What are you screwing?

975
01:06:21,924 --> 01:06:25,985
l'm attaching paneling
to some BA 1 3 in my room.

976
01:06:26,095 --> 01:06:30,361
lt's hollow,
so l'm a bit confused.

977
01:06:30,466 --> 01:06:31,797
l was thinking
an expanding anchor.

978
01:06:31,901 --> 01:06:32,799
Why are you screwing?

979
01:06:32,902 --> 01:06:34,460
Just glue it.

980
01:06:34,570 --> 01:06:37,801
Don't bother
screwing into BA 1 3.

981
01:06:37,907 --> 01:06:41,809
l have a dream glue.
Simple, easy to apply.

982
01:06:41,911 --> 01:06:46,314
Dries in a jiffy,
inexpensive, invisible.

983
01:06:46,416 --> 01:06:48,976
l'd even describe it
as sensual.

984
01:06:49,085 --> 01:06:51,679
Really?

985
01:06:59,796 --> 01:07:02,788
Can l help you?

986
01:07:09,172 --> 01:07:11,231
lt's loose.

987
01:07:11,341 --> 01:07:13,241
Yes.

988
01:07:13,343 --> 01:07:15,402
lt's not loose.

989
01:07:15,511 --> 01:07:17,502
No.

990
01:07:27,924 --> 01:07:31,155
Sorry.

991
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:32,818
Can l help you?

992
01:07:32,929 --> 01:07:35,693
You and your damn wallpaper!

993
01:07:35,798 --> 01:07:37,459
A faucet specialist

994
01:07:37,567 --> 01:07:40,730
is needed
in the faucet aisle.

995
01:07:47,043 --> 01:07:49,102
The Bazook.

996
01:07:49,212 --> 01:07:51,112
Serious stuff.

997
01:07:51,214 --> 01:07:54,115
You want the lowdown?

998
01:07:54,217 --> 01:07:57,448
You're in good hands.

999
01:07:57,553 --> 01:07:59,953
Perforator-engraver.

1000
01:08:00,056 --> 01:08:02,616
Accelerated hit rate:
57,ooo a minute.

1001
01:08:02,725 --> 01:08:05,125
Automatic variation
conservation.

1002
01:08:05,228 --> 01:08:08,425
lt looks very...
state-of-the-art.

1003
01:08:08,531 --> 01:08:11,261
Optimized cooling,
and the motor:

1004
01:08:11,367 --> 01:08:15,770
a Buchor 24
with a safety clutch, of course.

1005
01:08:15,872 --> 01:08:18,705
lsn't there a...

1006
01:08:24,213 --> 01:08:26,875
No, there isn't.

1007
01:08:33,356 --> 01:08:36,257
l want a double-injection
laser tracer,

1008
01:08:36,359 --> 01:08:37,257
three filters,

1009
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:39,351
and a Beuk DCA-7,
Fergussun,

1010
01:08:39,462 --> 01:08:41,521
and 1 8 Advantex cartridges.

1011
01:08:41,631 --> 01:08:45,863
But l need some information
about the Beuk DCA-7.

1012
01:08:45,968 --> 01:08:47,367
No problem.

1013
01:08:47,470 --> 01:08:51,167
l'd rather
you ask a colleague.

1014
01:08:51,274 --> 01:08:53,174
Your competence levels vary.

1015
01:08:53,276 --> 01:08:55,506
The Beuk DCA
is very particular.

1016
01:08:55,611 --> 01:08:57,841
Can l have a demonstration?

1017
01:08:57,947 --> 01:09:01,678
Of course.

1018
01:09:01,784 --> 01:09:04,514
Here you have
the control panel

1019
01:09:04,620 --> 01:09:07,350
with its built-in screen.

1020
01:09:07,457 --> 01:09:10,017
That's the emergency light.

1021
01:09:10,126 --> 01:09:11,354
Nice.

1022
01:09:11,461 --> 01:09:13,088
Gets your juices flowing.

1023
01:09:14,530 --> 01:09:16,930
At what speed
does it perforate?

1024
01:09:17,033 --> 01:09:19,263
Well, it's variable.

1025
01:09:19,368 --> 01:09:22,360
lt allows you
to perforate...

1026
01:09:28,377 --> 01:09:31,369
That's the demonstration.

1027
01:09:35,718 --> 01:09:39,620
What else does it do?

1028
01:09:39,722 --> 01:09:46,457
As you can see,
the thing spins around.

1029
01:09:46,562 --> 01:09:48,553
Careful.

1030
01:10:02,111 --> 01:10:03,009
Cool.

1031
01:10:03,112 --> 01:10:05,546
Pretty cool.

1032
01:10:05,648 --> 01:10:08,208
l'd like to...

1033
01:10:08,317 --> 01:10:11,218
lt's over now.

1034
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:12,719
Sit.

1035
01:10:12,822 --> 01:10:14,380
Very good.

1036
01:10:14,490 --> 01:10:16,720
l really like
the cooling system.

1037
01:10:16,826 --> 01:10:18,726
Before, it was underneath.

1038
01:10:18,828 --> 01:10:22,889
Now it's on top.
Very practical.

1039
01:10:22,999 --> 01:10:24,660
lt's not stopping.

1040
01:10:28,304 --> 01:10:29,862
lt's still on.

1041
01:10:29,972 --> 01:10:35,205
lt's just the inertia.

1042
01:10:35,311 --> 01:10:38,439
Now it's slowing down.

1043
01:10:38,548 --> 01:10:41,779
You're a pain!
l'm fed up!

1044
01:10:41,884 --> 01:10:44,785
Asshole!
What a nightmare!

1045
01:10:44,887 --> 01:10:47,447
This socket
costs a fortune!

1046
01:10:47,557 --> 01:10:50,287
The nerve of you!
What do you think?

1047
01:10:50,393 --> 01:10:52,293
46 euros for a socket.

1048
01:10:52,395 --> 01:10:55,796
Sock it to me!

1049
01:10:55,898 --> 01:10:58,128
Don't get so worked up!

1050
01:10:58,234 --> 01:11:00,634
Want some herbal tea?

1051
01:11:00,736 --> 01:11:04,297
What's wrong?
Husband trouble?

1052
01:11:04,407 --> 01:11:07,968
lf he's fixing up the house,
then he's faithful.

1053
01:11:08,077 --> 01:11:10,307
He's doing it out of guilt.

1054
01:11:10,413 --> 01:11:13,143
Retiling the bathroom
isn't enough.

1055
01:11:13,249 --> 01:11:16,150
Give him a break.
A pretty girl like you...

1056
01:11:16,252 --> 01:11:18,311
Buy him some mortar.

1057
01:11:18,421 --> 01:11:20,821
Stockar does good mortar.

1058
01:11:20,923 --> 01:11:22,481
Let's see.

1059
01:11:22,592 --> 01:11:23,991
Who cares about the color?

1060
01:11:24,093 --> 01:11:27,494
You're wrong.
Almond grouting is very nice.

1061
01:11:27,597 --> 01:11:29,155
Think so?

1062
01:11:29,265 --> 01:11:33,497
Based on what l see
of your personality...

1063
01:11:33,603 --> 01:11:37,835
This is a compliment.
You're a little devil.

1064
01:11:37,940 --> 01:11:39,669
l like my job.

1065
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:41,675
Live alone?

1066
01:11:41,777 --> 01:11:42,835
l may.

1067
01:11:42,945 --> 01:11:44,344
You may?

1068
01:11:44,447 --> 01:11:45,471
May.

1069
01:11:45,581 --> 01:11:47,014
May what?

1070
01:11:47,116 --> 01:11:49,676
May, June, July, August,
September.

1071
01:11:49,785 --> 01:11:51,013
l see.

1072
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:54,021
See what?

1073
01:11:54,123 --> 01:11:57,024
That you're a devil.

1074
01:11:57,126 --> 01:12:00,118
Where the devil
are you off to?

1075
01:12:21,083 --> 01:12:22,482
Maurice?

1076
01:12:22,585 --> 01:12:24,246
Paul?

1077
01:12:33,329 --> 01:12:36,059
Do you have...

1078
01:12:36,165 --> 01:12:37,723
doormats?

1079
01:12:37,833 --> 01:12:40,063
Yes.
ln the back of the store.

1080
01:12:40,169 --> 01:12:42,729
Ask for Romain.
He'll be happy to help.

1081
01:12:42,838 --> 01:12:46,604
Very kind of you.

1082
01:12:46,709 --> 01:12:48,700
Romain?

1083
01:12:50,613 --> 01:12:53,207
Romain?

1084
01:12:57,553 --> 01:12:59,453
Romain?

1085
01:12:59,555 --> 01:13:01,887
Yes, yes?

1086
01:13:07,463 --> 01:13:09,124
Come in.

1087
01:13:19,909 --> 01:13:21,467
Hello, Romain.

1088
01:13:21,577 --> 01:13:22,976
Hello.

1089
01:13:23,079 --> 01:13:24,478
l'd like...

1090
01:13:24,580 --> 01:13:26,309
a doormat.

1091
01:13:26,415 --> 01:13:28,975
They're all here.
Help yourself.

1092
01:13:29,085 --> 01:13:32,486
Plenty of choice.

1093
01:13:32,588 --> 01:13:35,148
We can print your initials
on them.

1094
01:13:35,257 --> 01:13:37,657
No, no triumphalism.

1095
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:42,322
Or else we can print
''Welcome.''

1096
01:13:42,431 --> 01:13:44,524
lt's not always the case.

1097
01:13:44,633 --> 01:13:47,693
You can put
''Bad Dog.''

1098
01:13:47,803 --> 01:13:49,703
My dog is dead.

1099
01:13:49,805 --> 01:13:52,035
Then you can put
''Bad Wife.''

1100
01:13:52,141 --> 01:13:53,699
My wife's very nice.

1101
01:13:53,809 --> 01:13:57,040
Then you can put
''Good Wife.''

1102
01:13:57,146 --> 01:14:02,140
But then l wouldn't be able
to wipe my feet on it.

1103
01:15:01,443 --> 01:15:03,377
Never go higher than five.

1104
01:15:03,479 --> 01:15:05,208
Yes.

1105
01:15:05,314 --> 01:15:08,078
l think
l'll take a smaller one.

1106
01:15:08,184 --> 01:15:10,414
Take the...

1107
01:15:10,519 --> 01:15:12,419
Mini-Bazook.

1108
01:15:12,521 --> 01:15:15,922
Small but...powerful.

1109
01:15:16,025 --> 01:15:18,425
At Brico Dream,
we're a team,

1110
01:15:18,527 --> 01:15:20,757
to help you find
the right palette

1111
01:15:20,863 --> 01:15:22,922
for the summer.

1112
01:15:23,032 --> 01:15:26,763
Also check out our plasters
in the paint department.

1113
01:15:26,869 --> 01:15:30,600
1 5% off melamine shelves.

1114
01:15:30,706 --> 01:15:33,766
What the hell?
Not the melamine shelves.

1115
01:15:33,876 --> 01:15:35,275
l'm hallucinating.

1116
01:15:35,377 --> 01:15:37,277
She didn't invent the Post-it.

1117
01:15:37,379 --> 01:15:40,109
Our lampshades
are still on sale.

1118
01:15:40,216 --> 01:15:43,447
3o% off selected models

1119
01:15:43,552 --> 01:15:46,544
for a soft, warm glow
in every room of your house.

1120
01:16:17,319 --> 01:16:19,879
Do you have Sporgex?

1121
01:16:19,989 --> 01:16:22,924
Sporgex liquid
or Sporgex foam?

1122
01:16:23,025 --> 01:16:26,017
Shit, she didn't say.

1123
01:16:29,431 --> 01:16:31,160
How's your wife?

1124
01:16:31,267 --> 01:16:32,495
Fine.

1125
01:16:32,601 --> 01:16:36,833
We listened to Aime
and took a kayak trip.

1126
01:16:36,939 --> 01:16:39,499
How's your wife, Maurice?

1127
01:16:39,608 --> 01:16:41,838
The second operation
went well.

1128
01:16:41,944 --> 01:16:44,344
Still intubated but okay.

1129
01:16:44,446 --> 01:16:46,676
l'm sorry.

1130
01:16:46,782 --> 01:16:48,773
lt's true, l...

1131
01:16:56,859 --> 01:17:00,761
Yes, Ducky...

1132
01:17:00,863 --> 01:17:03,423
No, l'm glad you called.

1133
01:17:03,532 --> 01:17:06,933
Thanks very much.
Love you too.

1134
01:17:07,036 --> 01:17:08,435
Thanks for the tip.

1135
01:17:08,537 --> 01:17:10,528
What tip?

1136
01:17:13,542 --> 01:17:16,272
How was your vacation
with Ducky?

1137
01:17:16,378 --> 01:17:19,438
Was it good?

1138
01:17:19,548 --> 01:17:23,109
Pretty good.

1139
01:17:23,218 --> 01:17:25,118
What's her name again?

1140
01:17:25,220 --> 01:17:28,018
- Lucie.
- Oh, yeah?

1141
01:17:28,123 --> 01:17:31,684
Her name's not Virginie?

1142
01:17:31,794 --> 01:17:35,696
Her name was never Virginie.

1143
01:17:35,798 --> 01:17:38,358
What did she give you
for your birthday?

1144
01:17:38,467 --> 01:17:40,332
A stupid game.

1145
01:17:40,436 --> 01:17:41,994
You fish stuff out.

1146
01:17:42,104 --> 01:17:43,503
lf you touch the edge,

1147
01:17:43,605 --> 01:17:45,505
it buzzes,
and the nose lights up.

1148
01:17:45,607 --> 01:17:47,666
- That was your present
from Virginie?

1149
01:17:47,776 --> 01:17:48,743
- Lucie.

1150
01:17:48,844 --> 01:17:51,506
He's got a screw loose-y.

1151
01:17:54,416 --> 01:17:57,146
My overstaffed staff,
get moving!

1152
01:17:57,252 --> 01:17:59,152
We have confused customers.

1153
01:17:59,254 --> 01:18:01,154
Did you see
my anchor maneuver?

1154
01:18:01,256 --> 01:18:03,315
Did you take notes?

1155
01:18:03,425 --> 01:18:06,986
lnstead of four screw anchors
at 1 o cents each,

1156
01:18:07,096 --> 01:18:09,826
she bought a tube of glue
at 7 euros.

1157
01:18:09,932 --> 01:18:11,160
She's thrilled.

1158
01:18:11,266 --> 01:18:13,928
That's selling power!

1159
01:18:28,584 --> 01:18:31,144
You okay?

1160
01:18:31,253 --> 01:18:33,153
What's this?

1161
01:18:33,255 --> 01:18:36,656
A customer
was fiddling with it.

1162
01:18:36,759 --> 01:18:38,659
No fiddling
with the wazziters!

1163
01:18:40,396 --> 01:18:42,660
These things aren't selling!

1164
01:18:42,765 --> 01:18:45,825
Let's knock 3o% off.

1165
01:18:45,934 --> 01:18:47,492
Raymond!

1166
01:18:47,603 --> 01:18:49,833
Change the price tags
on the wazziters!

1167
01:18:49,938 --> 01:18:51,667
3o% off!

1168
01:18:51,774 --> 01:18:53,002
Don't scream!

1169
01:18:53,108 --> 01:18:57,169
And it's not Raymond.
lt's Romain.

1170
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:59,008
Ma'am?

1171
01:18:59,114 --> 01:19:01,344
My cabinet is perishing.

1172
01:19:01,450 --> 01:19:04,010
- We'll have a look.
- My husband gave up.

1173
01:19:04,119 --> 01:19:06,246
Let me relieve you of this.

1174
01:19:10,192 --> 01:19:14,925
My grandfather made it for me,
when l was a child.

1175
01:19:15,030 --> 01:19:18,193
Of course...
Let's have a look.

1176
01:19:20,202 --> 01:19:23,933
The partition is diseased.

1177
01:19:24,039 --> 01:19:26,769
We can give it
some curative injections

1178
01:19:26,875 --> 01:19:29,105
and preventive ones
elsewhere.

1179
01:19:29,211 --> 01:19:30,610
Can you keep it here?

1180
01:19:30,712 --> 01:19:32,270
We can't do anything.

1181
01:19:32,381 --> 01:19:34,440
l'll give you Cyano Chiolate.

1182
01:19:34,550 --> 01:19:37,110
Spread it all over
the infected areas.

1183
01:19:37,219 --> 01:19:41,622
From now on,
you can't put any weight on it.

1184
01:19:41,723 --> 01:19:44,453
You mean
l can no longer use it?

1185
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:48,291
l'm afraid not.
The partition is eaten away.

1186
01:19:48,397 --> 01:19:52,800
ldeally,
you should remove the partition.

1187
01:19:52,901 --> 01:19:55,301
We'll remove it for you.

1188
01:19:55,404 --> 01:19:59,135
We'll do it on the double,
please.

1189
01:19:59,241 --> 01:20:01,801
Go on.

1190
01:20:01,910 --> 01:20:04,970
lt's in good hands.

1191
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:08,572
l want a massive dose
of Cyano Chiolate.

1192
01:20:14,656 --> 01:20:18,057
What is Cyano-shit-alot?

1193
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:20,560
Cyano Chiolate.
Follow me...

1194
01:20:20,662 --> 01:20:23,756
A kind of glue.
A dream glue.

1195
01:20:23,866 --> 01:20:25,766
They'll look brand-new.

1196
01:20:25,868 --> 01:20:27,096
The exclusive formula

1197
01:20:27,202 --> 01:20:29,432
is comprised
of microscopic crystals

1198
01:20:29,538 --> 01:20:33,269
that equalize
wood and plastic surfaces.

1199
01:20:33,375 --> 01:20:36,037
Solid as a rock!

1200
01:20:39,481 --> 01:20:42,211
l won't be jumping on it.

1201
01:20:42,317 --> 01:20:44,478
Of course not.

1202
01:20:52,494 --> 01:20:54,223
Don't pay any attention.

1203
01:20:54,329 --> 01:20:57,059
lt's just a sales pitch.

1204
01:20:57,166 --> 01:21:00,067
Want some herbal tea?

1205
01:21:00,169 --> 01:21:01,397
Herbal tea.

1206
01:21:01,503 --> 01:21:04,563
We have an eco-friendly
waiting area.

1207
01:21:04,673 --> 01:21:06,732
lt's very cozy.

1208
01:21:06,842 --> 01:21:09,242
Have a seat.
Take your time.

1209
01:21:09,344 --> 01:21:12,336
We offer a selection
of Relaxa Teas.

1210
01:21:15,551 --> 01:21:17,610
A steel trowel.

1211
01:21:17,719 --> 01:21:20,620
Wood handles,
plastic handles.

1212
01:21:20,722 --> 01:21:23,623
How much are they asking?

1213
01:21:23,725 --> 01:21:26,387
They don't kid around.

1214
01:21:41,310 --> 01:21:44,404
Give me all that!

1215
01:21:51,253 --> 01:21:54,086
Go help your brother.

1216
01:22:20,949 --> 01:22:22,075
Good-bye.

1217
01:22:22,117 --> 01:22:24,449
Thank you.
Good-bye.

1218
01:22:37,366 --> 01:22:39,960
Hello.

1219
01:22:40,002 --> 01:22:42,368
Why are you sitting
in the baskets?

1220
01:22:42,404 --> 01:22:44,269
You don't have a drink!

1221
01:22:44,306 --> 01:22:47,639
Nice cup of tea...

1222
01:22:47,676 --> 01:22:49,473
l don't know this stuff,

1223
01:22:49,511 --> 01:22:52,275
but it has
a nice calming effect.

1224
01:22:52,314 --> 01:22:53,941
Drink up.

1225
01:23:04,393 --> 01:23:07,521
l'll have to relocate
my shell collection.

1226
01:23:07,562 --> 01:23:09,826
Just stick them
somewhere else.

1227
01:23:11,733 --> 01:23:13,462
They're delicate.

1228
01:23:13,568 --> 01:23:17,470
Two beautiful Venus combs
with long teeth.

1229
01:23:17,572 --> 01:23:22,134
Can you hear the sea?

1230
01:23:22,244 --> 01:23:23,802
lt's silly.

1231
01:23:23,912 --> 01:23:25,311
l always believed

1232
01:23:25,414 --> 01:23:28,815
about how you hear the sea
in your ears...

1233
01:23:28,917 --> 01:23:32,353
Objects we like
should be displayed.

1234
01:23:32,454 --> 01:23:33,682
Keep your Anus combs out.

1235
01:23:33,789 --> 01:23:35,689
Venus!

1236
01:23:35,791 --> 01:23:38,954
l'll have some
of this weed tea.

1237
01:23:41,963 --> 01:23:44,625
They require a display case.

1238
01:23:46,268 --> 01:23:49,328
Tell me,
are you the type

1239
01:23:49,438 --> 01:23:54,171
to tidy up everything,
every day,

1240
01:23:54,276 --> 01:23:57,177
or to alternate tidiness
with messiness, disorder,

1241
01:23:57,279 --> 01:23:59,509
disarray?

1242
01:23:59,614 --> 01:24:02,344
Not tidying up
is a form of narcissism.

1243
01:24:02,451 --> 01:24:05,511
Because l'm knocking
3o% off melamine shelves,

1244
01:24:05,620 --> 01:24:07,349
and l thought...

1245
01:24:07,456 --> 01:24:10,186
Do you have polyplots?

1246
01:24:10,292 --> 01:24:13,022
Polyplots 1 2 or 25?

1247
01:24:13,128 --> 01:24:15,528
25, but ustensorial.

1248
01:24:15,630 --> 01:24:17,598
lnvitiated?

1249
01:24:17,699 --> 01:24:19,963
l'd prefer.
But size four.

1250
01:24:20,068 --> 01:24:23,128
l'm all out of four.

1251
01:24:23,238 --> 01:24:25,297
They don't make them
anymore.

1252
01:24:25,407 --> 01:24:29,309
The Chinese don't use four.
lt's only three or five.

1253
01:24:29,411 --> 01:24:31,641
You have to make a four
with three or five.

1254
01:24:31,747 --> 01:24:33,305
The Chinese again.

1255
01:24:33,415 --> 01:24:34,643
Want to see them?

1256
01:24:34,750 --> 01:24:36,308
Japanese, Chinese...

1257
01:24:36,418 --> 01:24:39,319
They're useful.

1258
01:24:39,421 --> 01:24:41,821
You don't say,
''l'm all out.''

1259
01:24:41,923 --> 01:24:44,323
You say,
''They're on order.''

1260
01:24:44,426 --> 01:24:47,088
Take care of the lady.

1261
01:25:02,611 --> 01:25:05,603
Our objects
will survive us.

1262
01:25:07,549 --> 01:25:10,450
Not if we don't
take care of them.

1263
01:25:10,552 --> 01:25:12,986
You like your tools?

1264
01:25:16,725 --> 01:25:19,125
Ever hear of Petit Pierre?

1265
01:25:19,227 --> 01:25:20,694
No.

1266
01:25:20,796 --> 01:25:23,856
His whole life long,

1267
01:25:23,965 --> 01:25:26,866
he built
a huge merry-go-round,

1268
01:25:26,968 --> 01:25:30,870
which he maintained
and operated every day.

1269
01:25:30,972 --> 01:25:35,909
The deaf-mute who did everything
with scrap metal

1270
01:25:36,011 --> 01:25:39,071
in the Loiret.

1271
01:25:39,181 --> 01:25:41,741
On his deathbed,
you think he asked

1272
01:25:41,850 --> 01:25:45,217
about his merry-go-round?

1273
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:48,517
Yes?
No?

1274
01:25:48,623 --> 01:25:53,117
No.
He asked about his tools.

1275
01:26:13,114 --> 01:26:15,105
You idiot!

1276
01:26:28,129 --> 01:26:30,962
The man who invented Boursin
made a fortune.

1277
01:26:40,141 --> 01:26:42,541
- Hello, Opportune.
- Hello, Mr. Verite.

1278
01:26:42,644 --> 01:26:44,111
You okay?

1279
01:26:44,212 --> 01:26:45,110
l'm fine.

1280
01:26:45,213 --> 01:26:46,475
A little tired.

1281
01:26:46,581 --> 01:26:47,878
l see.
lt shows.

1282
01:26:47,983 --> 01:26:49,814
Yeah, it shows.

1283
01:26:49,918 --> 01:26:51,647
ls Aime here?

1284
01:26:51,753 --> 01:26:53,653
There are other clerks.

1285
01:26:53,755 --> 01:26:58,192
l like Aime because
we understand each other.

1286
01:26:58,293 --> 01:27:00,352
l'll call him.

1287
01:27:00,462 --> 01:27:04,694
Aime is requested
at Customer Service.

1288
01:27:04,799 --> 01:27:07,131
Aime, come here!

1289
01:27:14,142 --> 01:27:16,042
He'll be here in a minute.

1290
01:27:16,144 --> 01:27:18,339
Surveillance.

1291
01:27:18,446 --> 01:27:20,607
lt's important...
security.

1292
01:27:27,455 --> 01:27:29,685
Are you hiding?

1293
01:27:29,791 --> 01:27:33,852
This is my wife,
Barbara.

1294
01:27:33,962 --> 01:27:36,192
Yes?
l didn't hear.

1295
01:27:36,298 --> 01:27:38,232
l was talking about...

1296
01:27:38,333 --> 01:27:39,391
Why me?

1297
01:27:39,501 --> 01:27:41,230
We understand each other.

1298
01:27:41,336 --> 01:27:43,236
l have a minor comment.

1299
01:27:43,338 --> 01:27:45,898
Last Wednesday,
l bought a yellow hook.

1300
01:27:46,007 --> 01:27:47,406
- Remember?
- Yes.

1301
01:27:47,509 --> 01:27:49,909
l wanted
to hang a bathrobe on it.

1302
01:27:50,011 --> 01:27:51,911
- Or pajamas.
- Please, Babs.

1303
01:27:52,013 --> 01:27:55,039
When l nailed it in,
l destroyed my wall.

1304
01:27:55,150 --> 01:27:57,209
You shouldn't sell
those things.

1305
01:27:57,319 --> 01:27:59,879
No problem.
l nailed it to the closet.

1306
01:27:59,988 --> 01:28:02,388
- lt's fixed.
- So what?

1307
01:28:02,490 --> 01:28:07,052
This isn't why l came.

1308
01:28:07,162 --> 01:28:08,720
Why then?

1309
01:28:08,830 --> 01:28:11,230
l'm getting there.

1310
01:28:11,333 --> 01:28:16,236
l have a space, an area.
lt's very roomy.

1311
01:28:16,338 --> 01:28:18,238
But it's not fully utilized.

1312
01:28:18,340 --> 01:28:20,740
Babs wants
to turn it into a room.

1313
01:28:20,842 --> 01:28:22,901
- What is it now?
- A garage.

1314
01:28:23,011 --> 01:28:25,241
No beating around the bush.
lt's a garage.

1315
01:28:25,347 --> 01:28:28,748
The problem
is that l have my car...

1316
01:28:28,850 --> 01:28:32,581
l didn't dent it.
Babs' mom has bad eyes.

1317
01:28:32,687 --> 01:28:35,417
- She dented my car.
- Okay...and?

1318
01:28:35,523 --> 01:28:38,583
l want...
To get back to the garage...

1319
01:28:38,693 --> 01:28:39,921
Stop it, Billy!

1320
01:28:40,028 --> 01:28:43,429
l want to turn it into
something warm and inviting.

1321
01:28:43,531 --> 01:28:44,930
Enough!

1322
01:28:45,033 --> 01:28:49,936
Warm and inviting.

1323
01:28:50,038 --> 01:28:52,268
lnviting
but also practical.

1324
01:28:52,374 --> 01:28:54,274
Because a garage
is a garage.

1325
01:28:54,376 --> 01:28:56,241
The door goes up and down.

1326
01:28:56,344 --> 01:29:00,906
Where's the car?
lt's not inside?

1327
01:29:01,016 --> 01:29:02,916
ln the garage.

1328
01:29:03,018 --> 01:29:05,248
ln the room.
The future room.

1329
01:29:05,353 --> 01:29:07,253
Please, Babs,
don't make things worse.

1330
01:29:07,355 --> 01:29:10,586
So l thought...

1331
01:29:10,692 --> 01:29:14,423
maybe you'd have an idea.

1332
01:29:14,529 --> 01:29:16,759
What is it?

1333
01:29:16,865 --> 01:29:21,097
l'm thinking...

1334
01:29:21,202 --> 01:29:22,692
And?

1335
01:29:24,205 --> 01:29:25,263
Not bad.

1336
01:29:25,373 --> 01:29:27,102
New product
from Clair de Lunette.

1337
01:29:27,208 --> 01:29:29,574
No-toil phosphorescent
toilet seat.

1338
01:29:29,678 --> 01:29:33,079
No shock in the midst
of your dreams.

1339
01:29:33,181 --> 01:29:35,741
No need for the bathroom light
at night.

1340
01:29:35,850 --> 01:29:37,909
Easy to see
glow-in-the-dark target.

1341
01:29:38,019 --> 01:29:42,080
Airtight
closing mechanism...

1342
01:29:42,190 --> 01:29:44,920
lt works.
Perfectly visible.

1343
01:29:45,026 --> 01:29:46,926
lt's smart.
Very clever.

1344
01:29:47,028 --> 01:29:48,689
A really great idea.

1345
01:29:48,797 --> 01:29:51,789
lt'd be funny
to place it somewhere else!

1346
01:30:02,577 --> 01:30:05,137
Mankind is really amazing.

1347
01:30:05,246 --> 01:30:08,647
Constantly inventing.

1348
01:30:08,750 --> 01:30:10,479
Do you gift wrap?

1349
01:30:10,585 --> 01:30:13,486
You sleep in there?
Not in the house?

1350
01:30:13,588 --> 01:30:15,647
We rented out the house.

1351
01:30:15,757 --> 01:30:17,987
lt no longer belongs to us.

1352
01:30:18,093 --> 01:30:20,823
You know
what we did yesterday?

1353
01:30:20,929 --> 01:30:22,988
Know what?
We had a picnic.

1354
01:30:23,098 --> 01:30:26,499
Beautiful day,
so we picnicked in the car!

1355
01:30:26,601 --> 01:30:28,000
lsn't that funny?

1356
01:30:28,103 --> 01:30:31,504
We lower the windows
to pass the peanuts around.

1357
01:30:31,606 --> 01:30:35,167
Funny.
But that's not why we're here.

1358
01:30:35,276 --> 01:30:38,177
What exactly
can l do for you?

1359
01:30:38,279 --> 01:30:40,338
Listen, l had an idea.

1360
01:30:40,448 --> 01:30:43,349
Tell me what you think,
honestly.

1361
01:30:43,451 --> 01:30:47,353
l thought we could make
a sort of hearse.

1362
01:30:47,455 --> 01:30:50,185
- ls ''hearse'' the word?
- A hoist.

1363
01:30:50,291 --> 01:30:55,024
A hoist is what l meant.

1364
01:30:55,130 --> 01:30:58,190
A hoist, and l'll suspend
the bed from above.

1365
01:30:58,299 --> 01:31:00,529
From the ceiling.
Babs, keep out of it.

1366
01:31:00,635 --> 01:31:03,035
So we have more room below.

1367
01:31:03,138 --> 01:31:05,038
- l have a call.
- l didn't hear.

1368
01:31:05,140 --> 01:31:09,201
- Vibrating alert.
- lt's very discreet.

1369
01:31:09,310 --> 01:31:13,041
Yes.
l'm sorry, Ducky.

1370
01:31:13,148 --> 01:31:17,016
Yes, Ducky...

1371
01:31:18,319 --> 01:31:21,413
lt's better if...

1372
01:31:23,491 --> 01:31:25,823
Forget about me?

1373
01:31:25,927 --> 01:31:28,987
lt's like...
you're not entirely here.

1374
01:31:29,097 --> 01:31:31,497
Been drinking?

1375
01:31:31,599 --> 01:31:36,502
You smell like a boozehound.

1376
01:31:36,604 --> 01:31:38,834
You have something
on your back.

1377
01:31:38,940 --> 01:31:42,603
Looks ridiculous.

1378
01:31:46,114 --> 01:31:48,674
Maurice,
don't stare at each leaf.

1379
01:31:48,783 --> 01:31:52,446
Scatter them around,
so it looks haphazard.

1380
01:31:56,825 --> 01:31:59,055
Paul, don't just stand there.

1381
01:31:59,160 --> 01:32:02,061
Help your coworker
with the streamer.

1382
01:32:02,163 --> 01:32:04,893
Not on the moose head.

1383
01:32:04,999 --> 01:32:07,661
Unbelievable!

1384
01:32:11,673 --> 01:32:14,403
Give me that.

1385
01:32:14,509 --> 01:32:19,071
Try explaining.

1386
01:32:19,180 --> 01:32:22,911
l can't understand him well.

1387
01:32:23,017 --> 01:32:26,509
Give him a paper and pen.

1388
01:32:28,690 --> 01:32:32,353
Write it down.

1389
01:32:32,460 --> 01:32:37,022
Draw instead.

1390
01:32:37,131 --> 01:32:39,531
You were drilling a hole.

1391
01:32:39,634 --> 01:32:41,966
And you ran away.

1392
01:32:50,678 --> 01:32:53,169
The drill was spinning
too fast.

1393
01:32:56,918 --> 01:32:59,079
Hungry.

1394
01:33:02,090 --> 01:33:05,821
An animal?

1395
01:33:05,927 --> 01:33:08,020
Putting up shelves!

1396
01:33:15,870 --> 01:33:18,304
Pierced the wall!

1397
01:33:18,406 --> 01:33:21,807
And the hairy thing behind it.

1398
01:33:21,910 --> 01:33:26,643
What hairy thing?

1399
01:33:26,748 --> 01:33:27,976
A rabbit?

1400
01:33:28,082 --> 01:33:30,983
A fish?

1401
01:33:31,085 --> 01:33:34,020
A hamster?

1402
01:33:34,122 --> 01:33:37,785
The animal spun around
on the drill.

1403
01:33:45,700 --> 01:33:47,292
You wore a wig.

1404
01:33:47,402 --> 01:33:51,736
lt was
your daughter's hamster.

1405
01:33:53,841 --> 01:33:58,073
Let's go have
some herbal tea...

1406
01:33:58,179 --> 01:34:01,410
Aime, the drill
is losing air.

1407
01:34:01,516 --> 01:34:03,541
''At Brico-Dream,
we make you scream.''

1408
01:34:03,651 --> 01:34:05,551
Fill it with helium.

1409
01:34:05,653 --> 01:34:08,213
He doesn't know how.

1410
01:34:35,149 --> 01:34:36,377
Hello.

1411
01:34:36,484 --> 01:34:39,385
Where are the wheelbarrows?
And you have diaries?

1412
01:34:39,487 --> 01:34:41,478
Yes, yes.
Be right back.

1413
01:34:49,564 --> 01:34:54,467
What have they concocted
for us?

1414
01:34:54,569 --> 01:34:57,470
Beware.

1415
01:34:57,572 --> 01:35:00,564
Touch with your eyes.

1416
01:35:16,357 --> 01:35:20,020
Hello.
l'm looking for fish.

1417
01:35:20,128 --> 01:35:22,688
And those?

1418
01:35:22,797 --> 01:35:28,030
For the wheelbarrow,
Robin said to ask you.

1419
01:35:28,136 --> 01:35:29,797
Can't l have a few?

1420
01:35:29,904 --> 01:35:32,134
l bought some
to give as a gift,

1421
01:35:32,240 --> 01:35:38,475
and they just
got electrocuted.

1422
01:35:38,579 --> 01:35:40,809
Are you okay?

1423
01:35:40,915 --> 01:35:43,577
Don't l know you?

1424
01:35:54,762 --> 01:35:57,629
We took a plane together?

1425
01:36:00,935 --> 01:36:02,664
Yes?

1426
01:36:02,770 --> 01:36:03,998
l know they're yours,

1427
01:36:04,105 --> 01:36:05,800
but l'd appreciate it.

1428
01:36:05,907 --> 01:36:07,807
lt's no problem at all.

1429
01:36:07,909 --> 01:36:11,140
For the modest sum of

1430
01:36:11,245 --> 01:36:12,610
3o euros,

1431
01:36:12,713 --> 01:36:15,841
you get the fish,
the sand, the aquarium,

1432
01:36:15,950 --> 01:36:18,510
and for the trip,
a splash of Fishcool.

1433
01:36:18,619 --> 01:36:19,847
lt relaxes them.

1434
01:36:19,954 --> 01:36:21,945
Sort of like herbal tea.

1435
01:36:25,726 --> 01:36:29,287
What did they do?

1436
01:36:29,397 --> 01:36:31,888
What about my wheelbarrow?

1437
01:36:46,214 --> 01:36:48,114
No, no.
That's the auxiliary.

1438
01:36:48,216 --> 01:36:50,684
Cut the battery.

1439
01:36:50,785 --> 01:36:54,118
Not the red one,
the black.

1440
01:37:11,239 --> 01:37:12,501
lt's nothing at all.

1441
01:37:12,607 --> 01:37:15,667
The Beuk DCA is polyvalent,
as you can see.

1442
01:37:15,776 --> 01:37:18,643
One of its functions
is tunneling.

1443
01:37:18,746 --> 01:37:20,475
lt's a home tunneler.

1444
01:37:20,581 --> 01:37:23,482
Speed racer!

1445
01:37:23,584 --> 01:37:25,245
Damn.

1446
01:37:54,081 --> 01:37:58,142
They opened the champagne!

1447
01:37:58,252 --> 01:38:01,312
Only once we've reached
our objectives.

1448
01:38:01,422 --> 01:38:04,152
We're toasting
for another reason.

1449
01:38:04,258 --> 01:38:06,158
Really?

1450
01:38:06,260 --> 01:38:08,990
Yes, to celebrate
Mrs. Renivelle's retirement.

1451
01:38:09,096 --> 01:38:11,326
l see!

1452
01:38:11,432 --> 01:38:12,660
Who?

1453
01:38:12,767 --> 01:38:14,291
Renivelle.
Solange Renivelle.

1454
01:38:14,402 --> 01:38:17,394
Shut off the helium!

1455
01:38:25,146 --> 01:38:28,138
My dear madam...

1456
01:38:28,249 --> 01:38:30,308
Revinelle...

1457
01:38:30,418 --> 01:38:32,010
Renivelle,
Renivelle.

1458
01:38:32,119 --> 01:38:35,520
These gifts...

1459
01:38:35,623 --> 01:38:38,387
very modest,

1460
01:38:38,492 --> 01:38:44,556
but which nevertheless attest
to this friendship...

1461
01:38:44,665 --> 01:38:47,566
this friendship
and this camaraderie

1462
01:38:47,668 --> 01:38:50,728
which we feel...

1463
01:38:50,838 --> 01:38:53,068
which we feel deeply,

1464
01:38:53,174 --> 01:38:56,735
which you feel
and which we feel,

1465
01:38:56,844 --> 01:38:59,813
which everyone attests for you,
of course.

1466
01:38:59,914 --> 01:39:06,979
One last word...

1467
01:39:07,088 --> 01:39:09,079
Bravo.

1468
01:39:28,509 --> 01:39:31,706
A special sponge
for cleaning windows.

1469
01:39:31,812 --> 01:39:35,213
What a good idea!
Thank you!

1470
01:39:35,316 --> 01:39:38,308
Wait, there's more.

1471
01:39:44,625 --> 01:39:48,959
An adorable object
for my night table.

1472
01:39:50,731 --> 01:39:53,291
This is the pump.

1473
01:39:53,401 --> 01:39:56,393
The pump.
Thank you.

1474
01:40:00,808 --> 01:40:02,969
l'm so spoiled.

1475
01:40:09,750 --> 01:40:11,149
Wonderful.

1476
01:40:11,252 --> 01:40:16,656
You didn't overexert yourselves.
What about the fish?

1477
01:40:16,757 --> 01:40:22,127
And here
are your new friends.

1478
01:40:26,500 --> 01:40:29,094
l'm very moved.

1479
01:40:29,203 --> 01:40:31,433
l didn't expect...

1480
01:40:31,539 --> 01:40:35,441
l didn't expect
an aquarium.

1481
01:40:35,543 --> 01:40:38,444
l was thinking a trip.

1482
01:40:38,546 --> 01:40:40,776
But don't get me wrong!

1483
01:40:40,881 --> 01:40:43,941
l prefer this!

1484
01:40:44,051 --> 01:40:47,282
Thank you.
Thank you.

1485
01:40:47,388 --> 01:40:49,618
Thanks to all of you
in particular

1486
01:40:49,724 --> 01:40:51,453
and each one in general.

1487
01:40:51,559 --> 01:40:56,792
l'd like to thank this company,
now a subsidiary.

1488
01:40:56,897 --> 01:40:57,955
This company

1489
01:40:58,065 --> 01:41:01,967
which allowed me
to meet the handsome men

1490
01:41:02,069 --> 01:41:04,469
who punctuated
my modest career.

1491
01:41:04,572 --> 01:41:07,632
l'm going to love
these friendly fish.

1492
01:41:07,742 --> 01:41:10,472
l'll give them your names.

1493
01:41:10,578 --> 01:41:14,810
That one there
is Mr. Borelly.

1494
01:41:16,817 --> 01:41:18,580
We started together
in Exports.

1495
01:41:21,989 --> 01:41:24,457
And that's...Simon.

1496
01:41:24,558 --> 01:41:27,186
The seminar in Lens.

1497
01:41:29,697 --> 01:41:35,294
And Charles,
who was so passionate.

1498
01:41:35,403 --> 01:41:37,132
On the job.

1499
01:41:37,238 --> 01:41:38,796
And so many others.

1500
01:41:38,906 --> 01:41:41,397
Gary! Where's Gary,
our custodian?

1501
01:41:41,509 --> 01:41:45,343
Gary! Don't be shy!
Come forward!

1502
01:42:56,650 --> 01:42:58,140
Thank you.

1503
01:46:43,243 --> 01:46:45,268
Look.

1504
01:46:45,379 --> 01:46:47,438
''l'm Aime Mermot.

1505
01:46:47,548 --> 01:46:49,948
''l'm speechless.

1506
01:46:50,050 --> 01:46:52,951
Thank you.''

1507
01:46:53,053 --> 01:46:54,953
He didn't see our banner.

1508
01:46:55,055 --> 01:46:57,455
l still think
your joke sucked.

1509
01:46:57,558 --> 01:46:59,458
Why did they shut off
the lights?

1510
01:46:59,560 --> 01:47:01,960
Why do you think?

1511
01:47:02,062 --> 01:47:05,054
Or else
they're French kissing.

1512
01:47:25,252 --> 01:47:28,983
Closing time...

1513
01:47:29,089 --> 01:47:30,522
8:oo p.m.

1514
01:47:30,624 --> 01:47:33,616
Closes at 8:oo.

1515
01:47:41,235 --> 01:47:44,227
Welcome, pal.
Newcomers go here.

1516
01:47:44,338 --> 01:47:48,399
lt's gonna blow!

1517
01:47:48,509 --> 01:47:50,067
Trust me.

1518
01:47:50,177 --> 01:47:54,409
No need to say more.
You got it.

1519
01:47:54,515 --> 01:47:56,745
l know about smart girls
like you.

1520
01:47:56,850 --> 01:48:00,752
What do you know
about smart girls?

1521
01:48:00,854 --> 01:48:04,415
l know more than enough.

1522
01:48:04,525 --> 01:48:05,924
Go on...

1523
01:48:06,026 --> 01:48:08,085
You started,
now continue.

1524
01:48:08,195 --> 01:48:15,761
l won't remind you of the phone
supposedly off the hook.

1525
01:48:15,869 --> 01:48:18,429
No, don't say anything.

1526
01:48:18,539 --> 01:48:21,599
Okay, then.

1527
01:48:21,708 --> 01:48:24,370
l'll stop.

1528
01:48:26,413 --> 01:48:29,576
You get the picture.
