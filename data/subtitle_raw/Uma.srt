All done at 450. Army purchase.

00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,000
Nice horse.

Thank you very much!

00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,800

What's a girl doing here?
Get out of here and go home.

50
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,870
Eh? It's fine. Let her stay.

51
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,500
You're Ine, Ine Onoda!

52
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,480
That was Mr Sakamoto's horse.
- You stay close down here.

Well worth buying!

55
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:06,150
A lovely horse! How much am I bid?

56
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,050
Starting at...

57
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,800
200! 200 yen!

58
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:17,450
(and 5!) 205!... (and 20!) 220!

59
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:20,550
204!  (and 4) 245! (and 50!) 250 yen!

60
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:49,500
Ine! I'm angry!

61
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,900
Where on earth have you been all this time?

62
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,060
I went to the auction.

63
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:15,800
That's more or less what we figured!

64
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:21,370
And just when your father and I
are utterly exhausted too!

65
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,850
Why so late?

66
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,400
You're inconsiderate,

67
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,900
running off like that.

68
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:30,990
I'm so disappointed with you.
I don't know what to say

69
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,830
But Mum...

70
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:33,860
How dare you! You know
what happens to kids like you?
But Mum...

71
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,800
How dare you! You know
what happens to kids like you?

72
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:40,000
I shouldn't even let someone like you
back in the house. Get out.

73
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,280
Go on... GET OUT!

74
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,150
Don't say that.

75
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,310
I'm desperately hungry.

76
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,690
That's not my problem.

77
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,740
Complain if you like,
but after I've eaten.

78
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,330
You cheeky little brat...
- Don't get angry with me!

79
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,920
How dare you!  You little...

80
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:04,330
Mum no!
- You little wretch! Come back here!

81
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,530
Ine! Ine!

82
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,330
Come here.

83
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:20,650
Right then.
You're not coming back in this house.

84
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,820
Well?

85
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:43,050
Papa! It's started raining.

86
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,010
Ine! Come and help!

87
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,480
Hey! Be careful!

88
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,690
Look where you're going!

89
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,900
OK.

90
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,310
Look!

91
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,150
Ine, you clear away.

92
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:44,330
It may be a stable
but it's all straw and no horse!

93
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:02,260
It would be much more fun
if we actually had a horse.

94
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,900
You're always going on about horses
but what would we do with one?

95
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,020
You know mum...

96
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:14,040
We're the only ones
around here without a horse.

97
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,370
Have you forgotten the one that died?

98
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:22,750
That was just bad luck.
We couldn't do anything.

99
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:27,920
It wasn't bad luck.
Horses always cause problems.

100
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,570
They're expensive and they eat up time.

101
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,160
Then they suddenly up and die on you!

102
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:41,010
You don't know it but we're still
struggling with the debts from that.

103
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:47,600
I've never heard of keeping a horse
lead to anything good.

104
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,080
Horses are not something we want to raise.

105
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,710
You say that because you hate horses!

106
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:05,660
Kyuzaemon's horse was sold
for stud today... for 1200 yen!

107
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,770
And Zenzou's colt was taken
for a cavalry horse at 450 yen.

108
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,350
Prices are going to go up higher too.

109
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,580
Nobody can lose money they were saying.

110
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,040
That's true, dad, isn't it?

111
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:25,500
Whether it's good or bad,
you can't raise a horse without money.

112
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,560
That much I know.

113
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,510
Mum, bake this for me.

114
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,600
Mum, bake this for me.

115
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,500
Chestnuts?

116
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,680
Yes.

117
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,760
They're early this year!

118
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,680
What are you doing?

119
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,510
What's it to you?

120
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:45,310
How dare you talk to your father like that.

121
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:49,300
I'm making a bathmat.

122
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,090
You'll damage your eyes
if you keep at it like that.

123
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,830
But my teacher said

124
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,830
it might be good enough to show
at the prefectural competition.

125
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:18,170
If your ruin your eyes
don't say we didn't warn you.

126
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:36,530
Well well...

127
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,590
It's Zenzou.

128
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:41,660
Come in.

129
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,450
Have you finished dinner?

130
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,450
Come in. Come and sit down.

131
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:02,100
Make room!

132
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,840
Don't stand by the door.

133
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,180
Come on in.

134
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:08,130
Come and sit down.

135
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,640
I brought some sake!

136
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,170
Wow!

137
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,920
Hey Kanjiro...

138
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,360
Listen to this!

139
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:21,840
They gave me 450 yen for him
as a cavalry horse!

140
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,760
That's incredible.

141
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,740
What an incredible price to get.

142
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,990
That's something to give thanks for.
Congratulations.

143
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,800
Wow...

144
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:38,670
Getting 450 yen is superb.

145
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:44,000
I thought he'd sell well
but I never expected that much.

146
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:46,090
Well I did!

147
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:50,010
The horses I raise are always reliable.

148
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:54,460
I know how good they are.

149
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,760
You look like
the smiling merchant god Ebisu!

150
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,890
You look utterly delighted.

151
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,440
Yes, I hardly know what to do with myself!

152
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,690
Help me celebrate!

153
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:10,490
Thank you so much.

154
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:13,670
Right then, let's drink.

155
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,270
Have a drink.

156
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:18,270
I still have work to do tonight...

157
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,100
What? But I want to celebrate!

158
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,720
Come on, have a drink.

159
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,340
You too, Granny.

160
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,540
Thank you.

161
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,530
And for you.

162
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,690
Thanks, but I don't need it.

163
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,010
I can't drink.

164
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:45,320
Oops! My mistake!
My mistake, my mistake!

165
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:50,850
(Sings a festival dance song
without clear meaning)

166
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,360
(SONG again)

167
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,410
That's funny!

168
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:08,220
That's great for the barefoot dance
at the Bon festival!

169
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:19,030
Who was saying how no good
ever came from raising horses?

170
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:23,030
Just look!

171
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:37,740
(Children's song: mentions Spring, then Summer)

172
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,140
You've almost finished.

173
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:49,610
If it's good I'll send it to
the folkcraft show in Tokyo.

174
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:57,280
Your snow-boots are scarily large!

175
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,890
Who on earth could fit into these?

176
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:04,330
Maybe the statue at the temple
is big enough to wear them!

177
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,240
Toyokazu, yours is a bathmat.

178
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,720
That's right

179
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,140
I see.

180
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:19,820
Looks like you made the pattern
with a yahazu (hooking tool).

181
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,620
That's a clever idea.

182
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,110
Teacher!

183
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,010
There's a horse!

184
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,390
What a beautiful animal.

185
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:43,110
Is it your family's?

186
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,690
Yes.

187
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,850
She's called Hanakaze
(written with kanji: flower+wind)

188
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:53,240
Oh, a mare!

189
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,740
Her stomach is swollen...

190
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,560
That's right..

191
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,060
She'll foal next spring

192
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,730
She's a fine horse.
Is she a thoroughbred?

193
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:11,880
No way. Anglo-Norman stock,
but bred in Japan.

194
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,010
Because of that Norman heritage...

195
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,370
I plan to raise her foal for the military.

196
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:24,470
That's a good idea. Norman stock have
strong legs and are well-suited for military use.

197
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:30,780
I must be going.

198
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,370
Good luck and work hard to raise your horse.

199
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,510
Come on then.

200
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,040
Toyokazu!

201
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,010
Was the horse bought at the last auction?

202
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:51,250
No, she's on loan.

203
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:54,810
So you mean
you're looking after her for someone?

204
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:59,250
Yes, but the foal she's carrying
is promised to us.

205
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:03,470
It will be hard work to look after
a pregnant horse through the winter.

206
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,650
Be careful.

207
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,070
Teacher...

208
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:10,530
I actually don't like horses.

209
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:27,400
(Bridal song for ceremonial journey of bride to new home)

210
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:19,640
Well, well! Hello.

211
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:26,500
Hello...
- Have a drink!

212
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:30,130
Come on!

213
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:32,130
Hello.

214
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:36,130
Please drink a toast.

215
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,040
Here we go...

216
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:48,060
Have another!
- No I...

217
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:52,200
Come back here!

218
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,740
Don't let him escape!

219
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,540
Come back here!

220
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,980
I said I don't want it.

221
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,560
Good isn't it! Have another!

222
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,370
Drink with us!

223
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:29,010
Alright then...

224
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,380
Do you still feel cold?
- Yes, I'm cold.

225
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,630
So cold, so cold.

226
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,940
The chills won't stop...

227
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:17,670
Damn it. I'm so bloody angry.

228
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:20,600
On the slope...

229
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:24,720
I was behind the cart...
I stooped to pull...

230
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:28,260
and I suddenly fell backwards...

231
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,260
I know...

232
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:32,220
God damn it!

233
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:35,720
Damn them, he's so important to us
and they've ruined him.

234
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:38,680
They've ruined my husband.
A curse on them! Damn them to hell.

235
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,760
I hate them, I hate them.

236
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:47,110
There were many crows cawing
(an evil omen) outside this morning.

237
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:49,800
It's the horse's fault.
This is what happens!

238
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,650
Here!

239
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,200
Ine, don't feed the bloody creature.

240
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,640
But...

241
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:12,260
Father was in the wrong for getting drunk.

242
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,350
It's not the horse's fault.

243
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:22,170
Do you mean the horse is
more important to you than your father?

244
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,070
Good evening!
- The doctor's here.

245
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:56,860
The doctor's here, the doctor's here,
what kind of doctor I wonder...

246
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,960
but in this little village
the doctor's just a useless quack!

247
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,590
Stop that!

248
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,740
You're in a bad way.

249
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:16,360
Yes but first...
thank you for coming so far...

250
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,720
No problem.

251
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,290
I want you kids outside.

252
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:27,440
Ine, take the kids outside.

253
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:31,270
Toyokazu!

254
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,770
I don't want to! I don't want to!

255
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:09,840
Come on hurry up!
-  I don't want to!

256
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,160
Come on. I know what to play...

257
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,420
Riddles!
- I don't want to!

258
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,700
Shush!

259
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,520
OK, here goes...

260
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:26,480
When it stand it's like a cat...
when it sleeps it's Grandma... what is it?

261
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:31,320
Upright = a cat?
Lying down = Granny?

262
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:36,000
That's easy! It's the Chouchin lantern!

263
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,650
When you stretch it it moves like a cat...

264
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,950
When you squeeze it shut
it's as wrinkly as granny!

265
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,220
He's right!

266
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,240
OK. You're right.

267
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,920
Let's have another one.

268
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,660
What did the doctor say?

269
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,740
Dad needs an operation straight away.

270
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,020
Why does he need it?

271
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:27,200
Well I don't know...

272
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,820
Come on, let's play hide and seek.
- I don't want to.

273
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,380
Right then! Hide-and-seek!

274
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:50,460
(Play janken to decide
who hides and who seeks)

275
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,940
You're it! You're it!
- Ready?

276
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:55,480
Are you ready yet?

277
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,480
No, not yet.

278
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:00,350
Ready?

279
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:03,670
Not, yet not yet.

280
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,550
Ready?

281
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:09,500
No, not yet.

282
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,120
Ready?

283
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,320
Ready?

284
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:31,530
There's a whole bucket of fresh blood...
- That's bad.

285
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,920
When he put some medicine on it
lots of white, bubbling slime came out!

286
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,350
Is dad going to die?

287
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:50,820
Don't be silly.
It's not bad enough to die from.

288
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:53,620
I don't think so anyway.

289
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:35,900
Shaman-style Chanting (folk healer)

290
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:11,800
(talks of driving away this persistent ill)

291
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:22,850
(talks of gratitude for
receiving the benefit of healing)

292
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:32,080
on and on in
a garbled pseudo-religious babble.

293
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:45,800
This way!

294
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:57,670
Granny!

295
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:01,270
I'm hungry.
- You must wait.

296
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:07,120
The doctor expects him to be
up and about in 2 or 3 days.

297
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:10,960
We'll be in trouble
if he doesn't get better quickly.

298
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:13,750
Yeaah? He's not really a doctor.

299
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:17,000
You can't believe what he says.

300
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:27,450
Well, as far as I can tell....

301
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,180
He's been cursed.

302
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,880
There is an evil spirit.

303
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:37,220
What kind of spirit?

304
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:39,100
Well...

305
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,870
An evil spirit...

306
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:45,050
Hey! I'm hungry!
- Me too! - Make us something to eat!

307
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:49,720
Be quiet. He's praying for your father.

308
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:54,650
Mum will be home soon
and we'll eat but until then stay quiet.

309
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,150
What kind of spirit?

310
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:58,870
Well...

311
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:03,120
An evil spirit... I think it's four-legged.

312
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:04,860
Four-legged?

313
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:08,320
So that must mean...

314
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,840
Maybe it's the horse?

315
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,720
A horse? Oh yes, it's the horse.

316
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,600
What a ridiculous tale!

317
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,860
To blame the horse
is utterly ridiculous.

318
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:31,170
Dinner! Make dinner!

319
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,300
Roast us some yams!

320
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,450
Wait. When mum
comes back we'll eat properly.

321
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:05,300
It's horrible, we're 300 yen
in debt to the farm union.

322
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:27,970
What can we do?

323
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:16,300
Ine, why are you still waiting here?

324
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:19,140
Why don't you go and get firewood?

325
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:23,320
Don't you realise
it's cold and I'm half frozen?

326
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:25,670
Here!

327
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:38,240
You're alright beside the fire
but think of your frozen mum.

328
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:43,420
There's nothing for the horse to eat.

329
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,360
I can't stand you sometimes, Ine.

330
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:56,600
Do you know how much of a disaster
your horse has caused this family?

331
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:03,850
We're in a real mess.

332
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:09,240
It's as if you've brought a curse
of bad luck on us with that horse.

333
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:13,190
And there's nothing we can do!

334
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,180
How dare you look at me like that!

335
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:24,100
They say if you glare at your parents
your face will end up end ugly.

336
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,680
But.... I really don't understand
half the nonsense you say.

337
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:32,690
So you're going to talk back to me?

338
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:35,360
I have no idea what you're on about!

339
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:59,550
How on earth can we get out from this?

340
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:03,020
We're in debt...

341
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:06,550
I can't buy anything at all for New Year.

342
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,050
What on earth am I going to do?

343
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:44,090
Here!

344
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:01,740
Never mind about feeding the damned horse...

345
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:04,320
We humans have to eat too.

346
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:08,900
Kinjiro and Tsuru are hungry.

347
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:13,170
Ine loves that horse more than
her sweet little brother and sister.

348
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:23,050
The Union said they'll wait.

349
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:28,300
And the chairman gave me some eggs for you.

350
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:34,750
Eggs? From the chairman?

351
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:39,760
I'm embarrassed... but really grateful.

352
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,080
He's a really good man.

353
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,590
Will you have some egg?

354
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:51,040
I need you to get well quickly
or it will be hard for me.

355
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:04,440
Where've they gone?
I'm sure I put them here.

356
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,860
That's strange!

357
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:28,940
I had them at the union...
they wrapped them for me!

358
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:35,700
There were 8 eggs...

359
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:39,660
Did someone take them? Eh?

360
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:43,380
Surely it can't be you grandma...

361
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,170
Kinjirou, it was you!
- It wasn't me.

362
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:54,320
If it wasn't you then open your mouth.

363
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:59,810
If you lie a demon will come
and rip out your tongue!

364
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:01,750
I told you it wasn't me.

365
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,480
How odd...

366
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,150
Recorded Delivery!

367
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:45,020
Recorded delivery?
What's that mean?

368
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:47,020
I dunno...

369
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:52,170
Hey, do you think it's the debt collectors?

370
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:55,620
Surely not...

371
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,760
I need your hanko seal here.
- My seal?

372
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:07,320
Don't accept it until you've had
a good look to see what it is.

373
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:10,000
If it's from anywhere bad
make them take it away.

374
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,570
He says its definitely for us.

375
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:14,050
Really? Where's it from?

376
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:15,500
From Tokyo.

377
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,820
Tokyo?

378
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:18,760
Hurry up and stamp it.

379
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:24,340
Where did I put my hanko...
I had it when I was at the union...

380
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:45,180
Here you are.

381
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:55,260
Quickly then! Show me what it is.
- Hang on and I'll open it.

382
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:04,690
Give it here!

383
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:11,930
Wow, it's typewritten!

384
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:18,050
Respectful greetings.
Allow me to come straight to the point.

385
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,970
At the recent Exhibition of folkcraft
in the Mingeikan in Tokyo...

386
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:27,360
as part of the North East
Farming Villages exhibit...

387
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:30,300
What's a "Mingeikan"?

388
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,000
Shut up and let her read it!

389
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,850
The bathmat which you exhibited
received a lot of positive attention...

390
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:42,300
And we would like
to sell them here in the shop.

391
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:46,680
We therefore humbly request
that you send us

392
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:50,340
100 of them by March 1st.

393
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:56,320
As a deposit I enclose 30 yen.

394
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,820
Check in the envelope!

395
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,350
Here...

396
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:03,600
It's a money transfer order!

397
00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:05,600
A bank draft!

398
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,040
It's for 30 yen!

399
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,700
Mum, Grandma... look!
A bank draft!

400
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:19,880
Wow, 30 yen. 30 yen!

401
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:21,900
That's amazing!

402
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,640
Dear...

403
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:42,960
I've given you a cheap price! Come again!

404
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:45,870
Thank you!

405
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:56,300

406

(Stall holder cries prices)

408
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:39,460
Happy New Year!

409
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:43,100
First have some mochi (rice cake)!

410
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,250
Thanks. What a treat!

411
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,250
What a treat!

412
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,970
It's ready! There's anko (sweet bean paste),
so come straight away.

413
00:44:59,170 --> 00:44:59,980
OK.

414
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,300
Come on. Come on everybody.

415

417
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,650

00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:20,470
(Children join the game)

419
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:14,720
As it's New Year
here's some rice for you!

420
00:46:26,090 --> 00:46:30,320
It's frostbite! I've got frostbite!

421
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:35,420
Frostbite?
I have a charm to cure that.

422
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:45,170
<i>Pain, pain, fly away up the mountain
1, 2, 3... Gone!</i>

423
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:49,000
Is that better?

424
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:50,440
No!

425
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:57,020
You're a pain!
You've been complaining for ages.

426
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:59,710
I've got frostbite.

427
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:03,620
So don't play snowballs!

428
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:08,550
Go to bed. Go to bed.
You wear me out!

429

(Folk tradition where monsters
called Namahage/Yamahage/Suneka visit)

430

Where are the naughty kids?
Who's bad?

431
00:47:40,670 --> 00:47:42,500
Who's the bad one?

432
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,860
Yes, we've got one. Here he is!

433
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:46,920
This one?

434
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,640
You're not going to be bad again, are you?

435
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:51,650
I won't, I won't!

436
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,700
Will you do what your parents say?

437
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,300
I will, I will!

438
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,420
Have you told lies?

439
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:01,500
I didn't. I didn't!

440
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:04,860
Are you sure? Really sure?

441
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:09,640
OK I did.

442
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,220
When did you lie?

443
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:15,960
I took some eggs and ate them.

444
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:18,280
So it was you!

445
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:20,400
What a bad boy!

446
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:24,780
And was it you
who took dad's machete and lost it?

447
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:27,390
I didn't touch the machete.

448
00:48:27,850 --> 00:48:29,760
Are you lying again?

449
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:34,400
I'm not lying.
I don't know about the machete.

450
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,720
You really don't know
anything about the machete?

451
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:44,300
He promises he won't do anything bad...

452
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:47,820
So please forbear from harming him!

453
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:52,440
OK, this time and this time only.

454
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:54,360
OK let's go.

455
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:57,180
Kinjirou, Tsuru, come on, off to bed.

456
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:00,200
Go on.

457
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:21,920
Thank you very much.
Please accept a drink.

458
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:23,620
Thanks.

459
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:31,980
Have a drink!

460
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:36,300
And you too! Come in.

461
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:40,570
OK I will.

462
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,710
Thank you very much.

463
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:54,000
Zenzo you bastard!

464
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:04,200
Snow, snow tumbling down, tumbling down.

465
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:07,120
Snow, snow tumbling down.

466
00:50:07,870 --> 00:50:10,040
Snow, tumble.

467
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:22,360
Mum? Mum!

468
00:50:23,070 --> 00:50:25,100
Now what is it?

469
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:27,470
Come and look!

470
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,320
What is it?

471
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:31,050
Hana isn't eating.

472
00:50:31,450 --> 00:50:33,270
So that's what you want.

473
00:50:33,470 --> 00:50:35,150
It's ridiculous.

474
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,250
Please come and look, mum.

475
00:50:41,770 --> 00:50:44,480
She's got no energy and just lies there.

476
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:46,800
I'm afraid...

477
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:49,030
Come and take a look. Please!

478
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:52,260
Stop going on and on about it.

479
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,570
I can't at the moment.

480
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:58,800
Just like a person, when she's hungry....

481
00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:01,400
a horse won't eat and won't get up.

482
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:04,560
It's nothing to get worked up about.

483
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,680
You're really unsympathetic, mum.

484
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:11,310
What will we do if the horse gets worse?

485
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:38,780
Ine! How's Hana doing?

486
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:44,440
Her muzzle is dripping... maybe it's a cold?

487
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,060
Yes. Maybe.

488
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,500
She seems bad.

489
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,220
Nasal discharge...

490
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:06,950
Dad?  Yes?

491
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:09,750
I think we need the vet to take a look.

492
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:12,940
OK.

493
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:15,380
Shall I go and get him tomorrow?

494
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:21,020
Yes, we should get the vet.

495
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:25,290
Of course it will cost money...

496
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:34,850
Maybe a cold is not such
a serious thing if you're a horse...

497
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:46,450
You go to bed. I'll stay up with her.

498
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:48,940
No. I'll stay with her.

499
00:53:22,370 --> 00:53:26,270
(chants to drive off evil spirits)

500
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:33,540
Chanting mumbo-jumbo won't do any good.

501
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,450
She needs the vet.

502
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:37,740
You're a kid and you don't understand.

503
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:40,120
Vets cost money.

504
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,380
Money...

505
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:44,250
and we haven't got any.

506
00:53:44,350 --> 00:53:46,370
So you're saying
we should just let her suffer?

507
00:53:46,550 --> 00:53:49,920
Well, for better or worse it's not our horse!

508
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:53,220
If the owner doesn't want the horse to die
THEY should do something.

509
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,600
It's nothing to do with us.

510
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:59,770
I know that's logical... but...

511
00:54:00,850 --> 00:54:02,440
Never mind about "logic"

512
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,870
You always say such cold-hearted things...

513
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:23,020
I feel so sorry for her
I can't bear to watch.

514
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,590
Hello?

515
00:54:50,070 --> 00:54:51,920
What the hell are you doing?

516
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:54,780
Oh, it's you Mr Sakamoto.

517
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,900
You shouldn't be here doing this!

518
00:54:57,070 --> 00:54:59,670
Get out of here. Go!
- I'm sorry...

519
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:03,130
You're still troubling the farms
with your ignorant ways?

520
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:05,870
If you do anything illegal
you'll get arrested again!

521
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:07,300
Get out of here!

522
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,270
I'm going. I'm going.

523
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:12,640
I won't take any payment from them.

524
00:55:13,330 --> 00:55:15,750
So please don't tell anybody.

525
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:18,120
I'm going. Goodbye.

526
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:28,100
He's incorrigible!

527
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:31,880
If he gave you some
rubbish potion to give to the horse...

528
00:55:32,170 --> 00:55:35,470
Don't feed it to her.
No good will come of it.

529
00:55:36,350 --> 00:55:39,460
Please could you look at the horse?

530
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:42,390
OK. I wonder what's wrong.

531
00:55:42,490 --> 00:55:45,560
She's not eaten properly for 10 days.

532
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,330
She's got equine distemper.
It's commonly called "strangles".

533
00:56:17,570 --> 00:56:20,300
It's a recurrent problem.

534
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,620
Large horses don't often get it...

535
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:28,100
But no matter what you do
sometimes horses develop it.

536
00:56:29,390 --> 00:56:34,390
Fortunately with this girl to look
after her carefully she'll be fine.

537
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:39,080
She'll be fine. Just keep feeding her
as usual and she'll get through it.

538
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:43,900
If it was anywhere other than here
she might not survive.

539
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:57,300
How is distemper treated?
What should I do?

540
00:56:57,820 --> 00:57:02,380
Well... it's supposed to come
from a lack of UV light.

541
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:06,080
So getting her out
in the sunlight is the key.

542
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:09,140
It would be best to give her
green hay if you could.

543
00:57:09,550 --> 00:57:12,890
I know that's nearly impossible
in the middle of winter.

544
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:19,700
But you might find some
around one of the natural springs.

545
00:58:52,350 --> 00:58:57,850
Ask the youth groups or even the police
to keep an eye open as they move around.

546
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:00,490
She needs it urgently.

547
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:03,600
But don't try to go up to Inosawa.

548
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:06,350
She certainly won't.

549
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:09,440
In this snow
even a man couldn't get up there.

550
00:59:09,670 --> 00:59:13,170
There'll be something closer to hand.

551
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:16,290
But this kid is a handful. She's tough.

552
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:18,610
She may well try.

553
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:20,480
What should I do?

554
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:23,690
I'll ask the youth group guys to help.
- Thank you.

555
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:27,770
I'll come along with you.
There's nothing I can do here.

556
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:32,120
I'm so sorry to trouble you.
Thank you so much.

557
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:28,670
(prays)

558
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:18,900
Ine!

559
01:02:21,050 --> 01:02:25,670
Ine! Ine!

560
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:35,870
Ine!

561
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:56,370
You idiot!

562
01:03:02,850 --> 01:03:06,070
You idiot. You utter idiot!

563
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:09,860
Mum! Mum!

564
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:40,800
Walk her round and round every morning.
- OK.

565
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:43,470
I'll do it over and over again.

566
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:46,320
Her legs have strengthened a lot.

567
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:48,250
She'll be able to have her foal safely.

568
01:03:48,450 --> 01:03:49,800
Yes.

569
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:55,020
When is she due to give birth?
- Maybe around the start of May.

570
01:04:01,050 --> 01:04:02,370
Come on.

571
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:33,240
<i>Spring is here. Spring is here</i>

572
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:40,150
<i>Both here in the fields
and up in the mountains</i>

573
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:49,120
<i>Flowers bloom, flowers bloom</i>

574
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:58,610
<i>They bloom in the village,
in the mountains and in the fields</i>

575
01:05:41,250 --> 01:05:43,020
Dad! Dad!

576
01:05:43,220 --> 01:05:44,680
Come quickly! Dad!

577
01:05:45,550 --> 01:05:47,800
Come on out! Quickly!

578
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:51,020
Never mind that! Quick!
- Hang on! No need to panic!

579
01:05:51,150 --> 01:05:52,800
You're ridiculously calm!

580
01:05:52,870 --> 01:05:54,800
OK. I'm coming.

581
01:05:56,420 --> 01:05:57,400
Hurry!

582
01:05:57,500 --> 01:06:02,560
You're too anxious. It's good to get on
with a thing rather than worry about it.

583
01:06:02,660 --> 01:06:05,200
Never mind that! Come on! Quickly!

584
01:06:24,050 --> 01:06:25,580
There there...

585
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:34,950
It's so painful to watch.

586
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:41,480
Her breathing is so laboured...
and so much sweat on her muzzle!

587
01:06:49,690 --> 01:06:51,320
Dad! Rub her stomach!

588
01:06:51,450 --> 01:06:52,320
OK.

589
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:55,450
There there.

590
01:07:12,620 --> 01:07:14,320
I can't bear to watch.

591
01:07:25,150 --> 01:07:28,880
Mum, how can you not feel sympathy for her?

592
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:32,580
Because she'll be fine. Stop making
such a fuss. Try to calm down.

593
01:07:36,670 --> 01:07:39,360
Is it so hard to give birth for people too?

594
01:07:39,550 --> 01:07:41,200
Silly girl!

595
01:07:41,380 --> 01:07:43,150
When I had you

596
01:07:43,370 --> 01:07:46,070
you were my first so it was really hard.

597
01:07:52,770 --> 01:07:55,770
There there, there there.

598
01:08:04,420 --> 01:08:05,870
Mum! Please come and look.

599
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,270
It'll be fine. Keep calm!

600
01:08:08,370 --> 01:08:10,270
You're so heartless.

601
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:12,590
Why won't you even come and see?

602
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:17,900
Dad! Is she OK?

603
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:21,170
I've told you already, she's fine.
Now go away.

604
01:08:27,220 --> 01:08:28,220
Mum, mum!

605
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:30,670
God, you're a pain.
Can't you keep quiet?

606
01:08:57,570 --> 01:09:00,730
Granny! Pray to Shourai (deity usually calling
the souls of the dead back at the Bon festival)

607
01:09:00,940 --> 01:09:02,920
Yes, we should pray.

608
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:07,860
Even Shourai has to sleep. There's no point
waking him in the middle of the night.

609
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:09,620
Maybe there is!

610
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:14,150
Stop complaining and pray.
Pray for a safe delivery.

611
01:09:46,890 --> 01:09:47,850
Ine!

612
01:09:57,340 --> 01:09:58,690
Has she given birth?

613
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:16,350
Did you say she has?

614
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:19,080
Yeah, she's just this moment started.

615
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:36,390
Don't peek.
She'll panic if you do.

616
01:10:51,730 --> 01:10:55,420
He says she'll be very panicky
and we should keep away.

617
01:11:16,820 --> 01:11:18,440
Ine! Come here!

618
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:19,560
OK.

619
01:11:23,050 --> 01:11:24,350
What is it?

620
01:11:24,450 --> 01:11:26,100
One of the legs isn't out...

621
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:27,370
That's bad.

622
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:29,820
It must be stuck.
- What should we do?

623
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:40,530
Ah!

624
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:46,500
It's finally out!

625
01:11:46,850 --> 01:11:48,300
Hooray!

626
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:56,510
It's about the size of baby deer!

627
01:11:58,770 --> 01:12:00,930
How ridiculously long its legs are!

628
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:06,140
Look! It's legs are all rubbery!

629
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:08,770
What's that covering the hooves?

630
01:12:09,380 --> 01:12:10,740
Keep quiet!

631
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:20,520
Stay back!

632
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:22,720
But you and Kendo are here...

633
01:12:29,620 --> 01:12:31,900
It's incredibly heavy.

634
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:39,520
So cute, it's so cute!

635
01:12:39,900 --> 01:12:41,170
Show me!

636
01:12:42,700 --> 01:12:44,060
You go to bed.

637
01:12:48,380 --> 01:12:51,700
It's so cute... yeeeah, so cute.

638
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:01,120
Won't she tread on the baby?

639
01:13:01,470 --> 01:13:02,920
I told you, it'll be fine!

640
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,340
Bring some cloth!

641
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:10,590
I need to wipe the little guy.

642
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:14,100
Here!

643
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,460
That's better!

644
01:13:55,580 --> 01:13:58,050
Come in and help me.

645
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:00,000
I'd be delighted.

646
01:14:00,100 --> 01:14:01,740
Careful!

647
01:14:08,220 --> 01:14:10,520
Give it to me!
- Here you are!

648
01:14:19,470 --> 01:14:20,670
Good girl!

649
01:14:21,350 --> 01:14:22,670
There we go.

650
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:28,200
Keep still!

651
01:14:28,350 --> 01:14:30,450
There there!

652
01:14:33,770 --> 01:14:36,770
It's enormously strong!

653
01:14:40,750 --> 01:14:43,020
Toyokazu, fetch some hay!

654
01:14:43,470 --> 01:14:45,460
You want me to get it?

655
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:00,120
Here you are!

656
01:15:00,900 --> 01:15:03,370
Wow mum... it's rare to see you so keen.

657
01:15:03,620 --> 01:15:08,270
Well I know everyone gets
incredibly hungry after giving birth.

658
01:15:11,250 --> 01:15:13,160
Here here!

659
01:15:15,550 --> 01:15:17,220
That's right...

660
01:15:26,140 --> 01:15:27,650
Come out!

661
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:32,750
Now it's dry it'll stand
and try to suck its mother's milk.

662
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:53,470
Look, look. It's going to stand up.

663
01:15:54,780 --> 01:15:56,380
Stand up!

664
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:21,710
Almost...

665
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:30,020
That's it...

666
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:32,920
Maybe not quite yet...

667
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:35,430
It's legs are still not steady.

668
01:16:39,220 --> 01:16:40,780
Here it goes...

669
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:44,640
Almost!

670
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:49,370
Shouldn't we help?

671
01:16:49,470 --> 01:16:51,850
No no, it has to do it by itself.

672
01:16:53,850 --> 01:16:55,350
Yes, I suppose so.

673
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:59,020
He's going to try again.

674
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:05,780
Stand up, come on!

675
01:17:06,550 --> 01:17:10,120
That's it! Go on!

676
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:15,920
That's it... that's it... nearly...

677
01:17:20,380 --> 01:17:23,270
Keep trying... you're almost there.

678
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:37,900
Almost there... come on... you can do it!

679
01:17:40,570 --> 01:17:42,300
Hooray! It's done it!

680
01:17:49,450 --> 01:17:50,950
Well done!

681
01:17:52,750 --> 01:17:54,200
That's it!

682
01:18:02,660 --> 01:18:04,380
Look, it's doing a poo!

683
01:18:15,850 --> 01:18:17,320
So it is!

684
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,200
So wobbly!

685
01:18:21,020 --> 01:18:23,100
It's so cute!

686
01:18:25,650 --> 01:18:27,490
It's like watching a drunk.

687
01:18:27,770 --> 01:18:31,400
It looks like Mr Sakamoto on the way home
after he's been out drinking.

688
01:18:31,850 --> 01:18:33,700
Look at it staggering!

689
01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:39,220
That's funny mum, really funny.

690
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:02,170
it's going to drink!

691
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:31,000
How cute its mouth is!

692
01:19:33,350 --> 01:19:35,650
It's poking its little red tongue out!

693
01:19:42,270 --> 01:19:43,190
Wow!

694
01:20:09,070 --> 01:20:11,920
Look, the sun's already up!

695
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:15,640
What a long night!

696
01:20:16,470 --> 01:20:17,900
So it is!

697
01:20:40,860 --> 01:20:44,070
The foal grew day by day,
cuter all the time.

698
01:21:17,820 --> 01:21:19,800
Come here you!

699
01:21:22,650 --> 01:21:24,770
Wait, Kozuo (little rascal).

700
01:25:07,870 --> 01:25:09,950
Hoi (used to call horses).

701
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:13,350
Hana!

702
01:25:26,650 --> 01:25:28,920
Hana!

703
01:26:18,820 --> 01:26:21,230
Kozou!

704
01:26:22,150 --> 01:26:24,120
Hana!

705
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:30,170
Hana!!

706
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:33,150
Kozou!

707
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:56,700
Come here!

708
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:04,070
Good!

709
01:27:04,420 --> 01:27:07,300
I've been waiting,
but I've brought you something nice!

710
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:17,600
It's salt!

711
01:27:20,020 --> 01:27:21,650
Here you are! Eat! Eat!

712
01:27:25,650 --> 01:27:27,440
Delicious, isn't it?

713
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:31,700
You're getting bigger every day, aren't you?

714
01:27:32,350 --> 01:27:35,300
I'll bring you something nice next time too!

715
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:59,270
Where on earth has Ine gone?
You can never tell what's in her head.

716
01:27:59,650 --> 01:28:01,570
Ine's up at the Oogata ranch.

717
01:28:01,650 --> 01:28:04,600
That's so like her! She never listens!

718
01:28:04,900 --> 01:28:07,920
There's no need for her
to come and see me off.

719
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:10,250
Here it comes now!

720
01:28:11,570 --> 01:28:14,600
The steam train's coming!
The steam train's coming!

721
01:28:14,700 --> 01:28:16,600
Do your best!

722
01:28:19,620 --> 01:28:22,770
Careful! It's dangerous!

723
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:31,120
Ine!

724
01:29:42,410 --> 01:29:43,280
Ine!

725
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:45,280
Ine!

726
01:30:16,900 --> 01:30:19,240
Ine!

727
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:25,630
Hi, are you back for o-bon
(Bon festival holiday)?

728
01:30:25,860 --> 01:30:27,630
Yes, that's right.

729
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:30,260
Are you enjoying your job in the factory?

730
01:30:30,360 --> 01:30:34,130
Not really, but who would?

731
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:39,930
I'll come and visit you tonight.
- OK.

732
01:30:40,260 --> 01:30:42,800
I'll tell you about the factory!
And we'll talk about films!

733
01:30:42,900 --> 01:30:45,260
Great, see you later!

734
01:30:56,300 --> 01:30:58,330
Please take a seat.

735
01:30:59,020 --> 01:31:02,530
I'm so sorry I haven't been able to pay.

736
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:07,700
I know how tough things have been
for you so I didn't press you...

737
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:11,310
But I'd like you to pay what you owe
at the end of the half-year. - I see!

738
01:31:11,630 --> 01:31:13,840
I know it's the Bon festival...

739
01:31:14,620 --> 01:31:18,760
but I can't do the books
unless you pay last year at least.

740
01:31:22,260 --> 01:31:25,820
I'll manage to pay somehow.
- Try and come up with an idea.

741
01:32:19,900 --> 01:32:22,600
I hear you're going to sell your foal.

742
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:25,810
I was shocked when Mr Sakamoto told me.

743
01:32:29,330 --> 01:32:31,510
There's nothing else I could do.

744
01:32:31,830 --> 01:32:36,060
It's a a terrible world we live in
where you have to do such a thing.

745
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:41,700
No matter how much you can get
I advise you not to.

746
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:45,980
I don't want to sell it...

747
01:32:47,070 --> 01:32:50,240
But with the half-year rent bill,
I have no choice.

748
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:52,530
I'll be leaving now!

749
01:32:52,730 --> 01:32:57,560
Thank you. I'm so sorry
we can't offer you anything.

750
01:33:04,830 --> 01:33:06,960
I'm so sorry we can't offer anything.

751
01:33:07,300 --> 01:33:09,240
Please forgive our rudeness.

752
01:33:17,640 --> 01:33:22,460
To sell a good foal
just for the rent is a waste.

753
01:33:23,330 --> 01:33:27,960
You'll lose compared to what you'd get waiting
until he's a colt and selling him to the army.

754
01:33:28,720 --> 01:33:30,200
I know.

755
01:33:30,730 --> 01:33:34,600
So think it over carefully.

756
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:38,700
What about Ine? Will she agree?

757
01:33:53,980 --> 01:33:57,820
You're really upset, aren't you?

758
01:34:02,930 --> 01:34:07,250
I know there's no help for it
and I'm trying to accept it.

759
01:34:32,200 --> 01:34:33,860
Come on, hurry.

760
01:34:59,860 --> 01:35:03,360
Don't just stand there. Quickly!

761
01:36:43,150 --> 01:36:44,980
Good evening!

762
01:36:46,500 --> 01:36:48,430
Aren't you going to the dance?

763
01:36:48,730 --> 01:36:51,760
You all look really pretty.

764
01:36:53,380 --> 01:36:55,590
Come on Hana, come on in.

765
01:36:55,810 --> 01:36:57,930
All of you!

766
01:36:58,730 --> 01:37:03,000
Ine said she wasn't going to go,
but we came to try and persuade her.

767
01:37:03,460 --> 01:37:06,660
Thank you for coming specially.

768
01:37:08,130 --> 01:37:12,030
Can you wait just a moment?

769
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:19,030
They want you to go to the dance.

770
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:23,030
Why don't you go?

771
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:26,940
It's so kind of them to come and ask.
They didn't have to.

772
01:37:28,130 --> 01:37:32,430
Go on, please, for me!

773
01:37:32,530 --> 01:37:34,430
I'll dress you!

774
01:37:34,860 --> 01:37:38,730
Take this off...
and let's sort out your obi (belt)!

775
01:37:42,060 --> 01:37:44,160
They're waiting for you!

776
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:48,900
Come on... put this on!
Here, let me do it!

777
01:37:58,140 --> 01:38:03,340
(obon dance music)

778
01:39:56,710 --> 01:39:57,630
Dad...

779
01:40:06,500 --> 01:40:10,630
Dad! Dad, wake up!

780
01:40:12,630 --> 01:40:16,430
Dad!.... wake up!

781
01:40:17,120 --> 01:40:18,100
What is it?

782
01:40:18,200 --> 01:40:20,160
Hana's gone! Where's Hana?

783
01:40:22,050 --> 01:40:25,930
Hana! Hana!

784
01:40:28,860 --> 01:40:31,590
She's gone looking for Kozou!
- What shall we do!

785
01:40:31,690 --> 01:40:33,500
I've no idea where she is!

786
01:43:29,020 --> 01:43:29,740
Dad!

787
01:43:31,620 --> 01:43:34,330
I'll go to the cotton factory.

788
01:43:36,740 --> 01:43:37,660
Ine...

789
01:43:38,010 --> 01:43:39,530
I'm going to the factory.

790
01:43:40,300 --> 01:43:41,270
Why?

791
01:43:42,620 --> 01:43:45,100
They'll advance me on my wages.

792
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:48,230
And we can use the money to buy Kozou back.

793
01:43:49,350 --> 01:43:51,220
Are you still on about that?

794
01:43:51,520 --> 01:43:52,960
I've made up my mind.

795
01:43:55,560 --> 01:43:56,760
Idiot!

796
01:43:57,330 --> 01:43:59,100
I know you love that horse but...

797
01:43:59,820 --> 01:44:01,660
What if the work makes you ill?

798
01:44:01,730 --> 01:44:04,430
What will be will be.
I've made up my mind!

799
01:44:08,320 --> 01:44:10,400
Ine! Ine!

800
01:44:12,400 --> 01:44:13,750
Please don't do that!

801
01:44:14,700 --> 01:44:16,950
Just calm down. Calm down!

802
01:44:22,740 --> 01:44:24,330
I'm going to get a job!

803
01:44:24,440 --> 01:44:27,500
You little brat I'm going
to beat some sense into you!

804
01:44:30,430 --> 01:44:31,340
You...

805
01:44:34,440 --> 01:44:36,050
You stubborn little bitch...

806
01:44:39,430 --> 01:44:41,560
Don't worry. It's OK. It's OK.

807
01:44:51,860 --> 01:44:53,630
I'm going. And that's that!

808
01:44:54,060 --> 01:44:55,300
Come on!

809
01:45:09,780 --> 01:45:12,830
Please take good care of her!

810
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:16,060
Take care, all of you!

811
01:45:16,500 --> 01:45:18,060
See you later!

812
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:44,410
Ine, eat this. It's mochi
made in blessed water.

813
01:45:44,720 --> 01:45:46,630
It'll stop your stomach getting upset.

814
01:45:49,080 --> 01:45:51,600
Take care of yourself! Yes, take care!

815
01:45:51,930 --> 01:45:56,830
I'm fine. Don't worry. I'll be able
to ride to collect you next o-bon!

816
01:45:57,940 --> 01:46:00,470
OK I'm off. See you!

817
01:46:04,070 --> 01:46:07,520
Sings FURUSATO

818
01:46:10,830 --> 01:46:18,900
<i>Those hills where I chased rabbits
and by the brook where I fished</i>

819
01:46:20,540 --> 01:46:28,520
<i>I recall these in my dreams,
oh my home town how could I forget you?</i>

820
01:46:28,660 --> 01:46:36,460
Grave marker for Grandma
<i>How could I forget you, oh my hometown?_</i>

821
01:46:36,460 --> 01:46:38,460
Funeral tablet.

822
01:46:49,960 --> 01:46:52,330
This is Grandma's first o-bon.

823
01:46:53,810 --> 01:46:55,600
And she was so well.

824
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:04,900
She even promised to ride a horse to come
and meet you on your return this o-Bon.

825
01:47:24,660 --> 01:47:26,660
I''m going to pop in somewhere on the way.

826
01:47:26,760 --> 01:47:28,560
Are you going to the dance tonight?

827
01:47:28,660 --> 01:47:30,330
Yes, I'm going.

828
01:49:22,160 --> 01:49:25,230
Hana, there you are!

829
01:49:25,760 --> 01:49:28,620
I've brought something nice for you!

830
01:49:28,860 --> 01:49:30,860
Where's Kozou?

831
01:50:41,070 --> 01:50:43,130
Wow, is that you?

832
01:50:44,030 --> 01:50:47,100
Are you really that little Kozou?

833
01:50:53,460 --> 01:50:55,560
Wow!

834
01:51:55,930 --> 01:51:57,900
What a beautiful horse you've become!

835
01:52:35,600 --> 01:52:37,700
Hey! You!!

836
01:52:41,860 --> 01:52:42,660
What?

837
01:52:43,100 --> 01:52:46,130
You're supposed to be back at the cotton factory!

838
01:52:46,600 --> 01:52:47,300
Oh!

839
01:52:48,030 --> 01:52:49,600
Have you quit your job?

840
01:52:50,160 --> 01:52:51,600
No, I haven't.

841
01:53:06,300 --> 01:53:10,960
You don't understand what calamity
you will bring on your family...

842
01:53:12,510 --> 01:53:17,500
If you don't return and your father
is held responsible for the debt.

843
01:53:19,530 --> 01:53:21,830
You need to think carefully.

844
01:53:26,330 --> 01:53:28,250
I'll go back to the factory.

845
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:33,300
But I want to stay here another week.

846
01:53:33,780 --> 01:53:38,080
There you go again! But sensei
has told you and we've told you...

847
01:53:38,900 --> 01:53:43,300
I don't want you here any more.
Get out!

848
01:53:43,860 --> 01:53:45,360
I said get out!

849
01:53:45,640 --> 01:53:47,360
Just a moment!

850
01:53:48,460 --> 01:53:50,250
Why do you want a week?

851
01:53:50,900 --> 01:53:53,460
I want to say goodbye to Kozou.

852
01:53:54,730 --> 01:53:58,000
He'll be sold at
the horse market in a week.

853
01:54:04,260 --> 01:54:09,830
I see. Mr Onoda, I'm sorry to pry
but is all the money for the horse...

854
01:54:10,300 --> 01:54:12,180
Is it going to be paid to you?

855
01:54:13,060 --> 01:54:14,240
Yes, it is.

856
01:54:15,160 --> 01:54:17,190
The foal is mine. 

857
01:54:19,100 --> 01:54:23,700
Won't that money 
solve your problems?

858
01:54:24,230 --> 01:54:25,700
No!

859
01:54:26,860 --> 01:54:30,230
At first I thought so but...

860
01:54:31,030 --> 01:54:35,500
There are quite a few
other debts that I have to pay.

861
01:54:37,760 --> 01:54:38,970
Sensei...

862
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:42,730
I...

863
01:54:43,900 --> 01:54:45,530
With the money from selling Kozou...

864
01:54:46,930 --> 01:54:48,630
Just maybe those debts...

865
01:55:41,430 --> 01:55:45,850
<i>Colt market for cavalry, farm or heavy work</i>

866
01:55:46,100 --> 01:55:48,530
Hey, hey.

867
01:57:03,200 --> 01:57:04,500
Hey!

868
01:57:04,800 --> 01:57:05,630
What?

869
01:57:06,030 --> 01:57:07,900
How much do you think we'll get?

870
01:57:08,130 --> 01:57:12,160
Well, not less than 400 yen.

871
01:57:12,860 --> 01:57:14,990
I wonder if we might get 500.

872
01:57:16,200 --> 01:57:18,260
If we were able to sell him for 500

873
01:57:18,330 --> 01:57:20,860
Ine wouldn't have to go back
to the factory.

874
01:57:47,760 --> 01:57:51,380
(prices being called)

875
01:57:54,430 --> 01:57:56,730
and another 50 is 350.

876
01:57:57,600 --> 01:58:02,200
50, 50.

877
01:58:04,560 --> 01:58:08,120
Please take care of him.

878
01:58:10,400 --> 01:58:15,030
352, 353.... 355 yen.

879
01:58:18,860 --> 01:58:21,260
If there are no further bids,
going at 355 yen...

880
01:58:21,930 --> 01:58:25,860
I don't like to see your tears.
Wipe your face!

881
01:58:26,420 --> 01:58:28,340
Next horse please! Quickly!

882
01:58:31,560 --> 01:58:34,400
Let's go look at the auction. OK?

883
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,260
Number 46, quickly please!

884
01:58:44,720 --> 01:58:46,620
Military approved.

885
01:58:50,500 --> 01:58:53,400
I'll start the bidding at 300, 300 yen.

886
01:58:53,760 --> 01:58:55,060
