1
00:01:26,641 --> 00:01:28,408
Who's there?

2
00:01:31,413 --> 00:01:33,858
Who's, who...?
Come on, come on, who's there?

3
00:01:33,882 --> 00:01:35,593
This is state land.

4
00:01:35,617 --> 00:01:37,684
You're trespassing.

5
00:01:57,873 --> 00:02:00,384
I have the distinct privilege

6
00:02:00,408 --> 00:02:02,520
and the high personal honor

7
00:02:02,544 --> 00:02:04,789
of presenting to you,

8
00:02:04,813 --> 00:02:07,380
The president of
the United States.

9
00:02:11,286 --> 00:02:15,766
The second time
around it sounds nice.

10
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:19,804
There's a-uh, messed up elk
out there on the old state road.

11
00:02:19,828 --> 00:02:21,239
Messed up?

12
00:02:21,263 --> 00:02:25,143
Mangled. Not by
any animals either.

13
00:02:25,167 --> 00:02:26,911
I've been so worried.

14
00:02:26,935 --> 00:02:30,414
Especially with that,
that Randall Tucker mess.

15
00:02:30,438 --> 00:02:33,206
Oh the hell with that Randall
Tucker. What's for supper?

16
00:02:39,181 --> 00:02:41,526
You ever hear of a Jeb Tucker?

17
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:44,529
Louise DuBoise said
something about a Jeb Tucker

18
00:02:44,553 --> 00:02:46,797
getting into her things.

19
00:02:46,821 --> 00:02:51,402
You don't think that,
umm, Randall and Liza...

20
00:02:51,426 --> 00:02:55,506
- What?
- Are starting a brood?

21
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,542
Ohh.

22
00:02:57,566 --> 00:02:59,510
Oh.

23
00:02:59,534 --> 00:03:01,512
Well God help us if they did.

24
00:03:01,536 --> 00:03:04,815
William Oswald the third, did
you just use the lords name?

25
00:03:04,839 --> 00:03:06,450
I did.

26
00:03:06,474 --> 00:03:09,375
Well, shame on you.

27
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:15,315
Jesus Fucking Christ.
There's someone out there.

28
00:03:52,587 --> 00:03:54,365
Ah! Ahh!

29
00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:56,589
Oh-ho-ho. Haha!

30
00:04:00,595 --> 00:04:02,240
Did you recognize him?

31
00:04:02,264 --> 00:04:03,908
- That boy?
- Yeah.

32
00:04:03,932 --> 00:04:06,410
Hit high and low
with an ugly stick.

33
00:04:06,434 --> 00:04:09,714
I've seen better east ends
of a horse headed west.

34
00:04:09,738 --> 00:04:11,282
Damn that Randall Tucker.

35
00:04:11,306 --> 00:04:15,753
Now William, you radio
that Sheriff right now.

36
00:04:15,777 --> 00:04:17,421
You hear me?

37
00:04:17,445 --> 00:04:19,657
Yeah, yeah, alright.

38
00:04:19,681 --> 00:04:22,749
Oh!

39
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:30,390
- Aghh.
- Ahh-ahhhh-ahhhhhh!

40
00:04:35,563 --> 00:04:36,629
Ugh!

41
00:04:40,669 --> 00:04:42,802
Oh! Ughh!

42
00:04:50,011 --> 00:04:52,323
Oh! Ahh-ha!

43
00:04:52,347 --> 00:04:55,081
Ahh-ha-ha. Ohhh!

44
00:07:29,103 --> 00:07:30,114
There you are.

45
00:07:30,138 --> 00:07:33,117
What's up?

46
00:07:33,141 --> 00:07:34,652
Is that Buck?

47
00:07:34,676 --> 00:07:36,454
Yeah, he ain't good.

48
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:38,044
Oh my God.

49
00:07:40,849 --> 00:07:42,827
Buck?

50
00:07:42,851 --> 00:07:44,562
Hey Kathy.

51
00:07:44,586 --> 00:07:46,464
Haven't seen you in since...

52
00:07:46,488 --> 00:07:48,721
Gosh, It's been
a month of Sundays.

53
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:51,891
You were in our prayers.

54
00:07:53,628 --> 00:07:55,795
Ready for that cherry pie?

55
00:07:57,966 --> 00:07:59,198
Made fresh.

56
00:08:03,972 --> 00:08:05,738
Yeah, ok.

57
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:15,526
Hey Mister, are you Buck Severs?

58
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:17,928
- Yes, I am.
- Can I have your autograph?

59
00:08:17,952 --> 00:08:20,631
Sure thing, buddy.
What's your name?

60
00:08:20,655 --> 00:08:22,916
Zack.

61
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,202
I knew it was you. Man, I loved
it when you body slammed the

62
00:08:25,226 --> 00:08:27,972
warrior in the steel cage
match at Mania twenty seven

63
00:08:27,996 --> 00:08:29,874
and when you fought
Buffalo Bob and roped him

64
00:08:29,898 --> 00:08:31,609
with his own lasso.

65
00:08:31,633 --> 00:08:32,710
Here you are Buck.

66
00:08:32,734 --> 00:08:34,612
Miss, you know this is?

67
00:08:34,636 --> 00:08:38,549
I think I have
a pretty good idea.

68
00:08:38,573 --> 00:08:40,718
- There you go buddy.
- When are you coming back?

69
00:08:40,742 --> 00:08:43,020
Soon. I have to
get all better first.

70
00:08:43,044 --> 00:08:45,077
I can't wait.

71
00:08:46,281 --> 00:08:48,581
Me too.

72
00:09:52,847 --> 00:09:55,915
Ugh!

73
00:09:57,952 --> 00:09:59,863
Trent?

74
00:09:59,887 --> 00:10:01,799
Pack your bags, the trip's on.

75
00:10:01,823 --> 00:10:03,334
What trip?

76
00:10:03,358 --> 00:10:06,337
Don't tell me you forgot
the return of bro's weekend?

77
00:10:06,361 --> 00:10:08,005
No, I didn't forget.

78
00:10:08,029 --> 00:10:11,775
Listen, be at Henderson Airport,
Friday, 7:00 A.M. Sharp.

79
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:13,210
First class?

80
00:10:13,234 --> 00:10:14,845
Better than first class.

81
00:10:14,869 --> 00:10:17,030
Where?

82
00:10:17,054 --> 00:10:19,216
Doing camping hiking in
the ass end of Pennsylvania.

83
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,951
You mean,
Detroit's all booked up?

84
00:10:20,975 --> 00:10:22,886
That's Morgan's thing.
Says we won't regret it.

85
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:25,089
I can't believe
you forgot bro's weekend.

86
00:10:25,113 --> 00:10:27,747
- Sorry.
- Just be at the airport.

87
00:11:20,401 --> 00:11:22,334
Are you alright, Mr. Severs?

88
00:11:56,104 --> 00:11:59,049
Hey, hey, hey, hey, Buck.

89
00:11:59,073 --> 00:12:02,052
Long time, no see man!

90
00:12:02,076 --> 00:12:04,321
Yeahhh. How long's it been?

91
00:12:04,345 --> 00:12:06,190
It's gotta be at
least three years, right?

92
00:12:06,214 --> 00:12:09,326
Three yea-Jesus.
Three years. Sh...

93
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:11,228
Well, you look good, you do.

94
00:12:11,252 --> 00:12:14,264
Sorry, uh, uh, about all the...

95
00:12:14,288 --> 00:12:16,967
Thanks. So, uh, how's Allison?

96
00:12:16,991 --> 00:12:19,236
Allison, that was
like two wives ago.

97
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,337
- Sorry.
- Ah, whatever.

98
00:12:20,361 --> 00:12:21,839
They know what
they're getting into.

99
00:12:21,863 --> 00:12:24,624
They know who I am.

100
00:12:24,648 --> 00:12:27,411
We get down and dirty with
some funky and nasty shit.

101
00:12:27,435 --> 00:12:29,079
That's TMI dude. TMI.

102
00:12:29,103 --> 00:12:30,748
And you tie the knot,
all of a sudden, get all

103
00:12:30,772 --> 00:12:32,249
clingy and needy.

104
00:12:32,273 --> 00:12:34,251
Like they got
exclusive rights to me.

105
00:12:34,275 --> 00:12:36,487
You know, in a
legally binding sense.

106
00:12:36,511 --> 00:12:39,022
So what, I bring a little
Chlamydia back from Thailand.

107
00:12:39,046 --> 00:12:40,924
You know, shit happens.

108
00:12:40,948 --> 00:12:43,894
It's not like I'm
betraying them emotionally.

109
00:12:43,918 --> 00:12:46,063
Well, oh but dude. Dude.

110
00:12:46,087 --> 00:12:48,499
There was this chick this
morning in Miami international.

111
00:12:48,523 --> 00:12:52,035
Big boned gal. Ya' know,
sweeter the pushin'. Am I right?

112
00:12:52,059 --> 00:12:53,504
So, uh, when is
Trent getting here?

113
00:12:53,528 --> 00:12:57,875
I pounded that shit.
Bro, two tons of fun. Bam.

114
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:01,912
Right in the middle of the
fucking Cinnabon man. Hahaha!

115
00:13:01,936 --> 00:13:03,213
You know what
the airport code for

116
00:13:03,237 --> 00:13:05,149
Miami International Airport is?

117
00:13:05,173 --> 00:13:09,520
M-I-A and brother,
my dick was M-I-A.

118
00:13:09,544 --> 00:13:13,090
Oh-oh. Heeey.
Ho-ho-ho-yea-hee-haa. Hahaha.

119
00:13:13,114 --> 00:13:16,927
Hahahaha.
Hahahahahahahahaha.

120
00:13:16,951 --> 00:13:18,362
Saved by the Benz.

121
00:13:18,386 --> 00:13:19,451
Hey.

122
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:29,373
Woooo. Nice ride!

123
00:13:29,397 --> 00:13:31,174
Tell me something I don't know.

124
00:13:31,198 --> 00:13:32,976
You could score some major
douche canoe in this bad boy.

125
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,178
Keev, good to see ya'.

126
00:13:34,202 --> 00:13:35,979
Haha-hey!

127
00:13:36,003 --> 00:13:38,182
Trent, how's it hanging.
Hey, how's the record business.

128
00:13:38,206 --> 00:13:40,450
Ah, It's DOA my friend.
Industries dead.

129
00:13:40,474 --> 00:13:42,168
Ah. That sucks.

130
00:13:42,192 --> 00:13:43,887
Ah, ay, we made some
good music. Put it out there.

131
00:13:43,911 --> 00:13:45,055
What more can you ask for?

132
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:46,990
Groupies? Hookers? Blow?

133
00:13:47,014 --> 00:13:49,593
Ahhhh. The classics.
Hey. How's car sales.

134
00:13:49,617 --> 00:13:51,195
- Through the roof, bro.
- Nice.

135
00:13:51,219 --> 00:13:54,498
- Whoop! Ha-ha!
- Woah, woah. Hahaha!

136
00:13:54,522 --> 00:13:58,302
Well, if it isn't
Buck fucking Severs?

137
00:13:58,326 --> 00:14:01,271
First class all the way Trent.

138
00:14:01,295 --> 00:14:02,539
That's why I love you.

139
00:14:02,563 --> 00:14:06,076
Well, don't thank me,
it's Morgan's dime.

140
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,112
Hey. If you two train up,
can I get Lucky Pierre?

141
00:14:09,136 --> 00:14:13,350
Hahahahahahahaha. Woah. Woah-oh.

142
00:14:13,374 --> 00:14:16,220
I'm guessing Morgan's.
Where is he anyway?

143
00:14:16,244 --> 00:14:19,011
He's at the bank. Come on,
we'll get him on the way.

144
00:14:33,194 --> 00:14:34,538
What?

145
00:14:34,562 --> 00:14:38,330
Jesus., you are one
sad fucking sight bro.

146
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,921
Would you stop
looking at me like that.

147
00:14:50,945 --> 00:14:52,456
What happened to you?

148
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,559
Uh, fractured vertebra.
Six weeks in traction.

149
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:57,294
That's not what
I'm talking about.

150
00:14:57,318 --> 00:14:59,662
What then?

151
00:14:59,686 --> 00:15:02,032
It's your eyes man. It's in
your eyes. The magic's gone.

152
00:15:02,056 --> 00:15:03,367
You're afraid.

153
00:15:03,391 --> 00:15:04,568
What the fuck
are you talking about?

154
00:15:04,592 --> 00:15:06,904
You're afraid of life.
It's Rocky 3, man.

155
00:15:06,928 --> 00:15:09,039
The eye of the tiger
or lack there of.

156
00:15:09,063 --> 00:15:11,208
You're gonna
quote Rocky 3 to me?

157
00:15:11,232 --> 00:15:12,609
It's like the worst one dude.

158
00:15:12,633 --> 00:15:15,045
Okay. Your scared
and your dissin' Stallone.

159
00:15:15,069 --> 00:15:16,446
The circle is now complete.

160
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:18,181
Why are you being
such a douche bag?

161
00:15:18,205 --> 00:15:20,166
What, are you taking a course?

162
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,152
Like I'm gonna sugar
coat it for you. Me? Okay.

163
00:15:22,176 --> 00:15:26,223
Excuse Mr. Severs. I am so
sorry that you grew a vagina.

164
00:15:26,247 --> 00:15:28,458
Shall we get in touch
with your feelings about that?

165
00:15:28,482 --> 00:15:30,260
I will kick your ass.

166
00:15:30,284 --> 00:15:32,930
Yeah, like that's gonna happen.
Look man, I'm sorry but I'm

167
00:15:32,954 --> 00:15:36,133
Mr. tough love and I
love you man so deal with it.

168
00:15:36,157 --> 00:15:37,467
You look like shit.

169
00:15:37,491 --> 00:15:39,536
This gonna be a
long weekend, isn't it?

170
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,139
You'll get out. You'll get
some fresh. Do some camping.

171
00:15:42,163 --> 00:15:44,007
Some hiking. Guy shit.

172
00:15:44,031 --> 00:15:46,243
Hookers. Don't forget hookers.

173
00:15:46,267 --> 00:15:47,577
Does it have to be hookers?

174
00:15:47,601 --> 00:15:49,601
Ah. Pussy in general.

175
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:54,518
Woaaah. Woah,
was that a laugh?

176
00:15:54,542 --> 00:15:56,253
Was that mirth?

177
00:15:56,277 --> 00:15:58,978
- You know what Trent?
- Ugh!

178
00:16:01,015 --> 00:16:02,648
Feeling better already.

179
00:16:09,523 --> 00:16:10,589
Ughh!

180
00:16:18,466 --> 00:16:20,577
Yeah, we're here.

181
00:16:20,601 --> 00:16:23,447
Okay. Said he's
running a little late.

182
00:16:23,471 --> 00:16:24,648
Noooo.

183
00:16:24,672 --> 00:16:26,899
He said, five minutes.

184
00:16:26,923 --> 00:16:29,152
- Yeah, maybe three times that.
- Oh, he's not that bad.

185
00:16:29,176 --> 00:16:31,054
- Hundred bucks?
- Yeah, you're on.

186
00:16:31,078 --> 00:16:32,489
Hey, remember the Prom?

187
00:16:32,513 --> 00:16:35,125
Do I remember the Prom?
He was two hours late.

188
00:16:35,149 --> 00:16:37,294
And he showed up in
that piece of shit Desoto.

189
00:16:37,318 --> 00:16:39,763
Was supposed to be
a limo. Man, Lisa was pissed.

190
00:16:39,787 --> 00:16:42,232
Hahahaha.
You didn't tap that, huh?

191
00:16:42,256 --> 00:16:45,502
No. I blame Morgan fucking
Childs, that cock blocker.

192
00:16:45,526 --> 00:16:47,426
Hahahahaha.

193
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:52,275
- One second guys.
- I got an important client.

194
00:16:52,299 --> 00:16:55,746
Hey, so, uh, what you wearing?

195
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:57,347
Yeah?

196
00:16:57,371 --> 00:17:00,117
I bet your ass looks fine.

197
00:17:00,141 --> 00:17:02,586
Nah, baby. I'll be gone
just for the weekend.

198
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:04,043
I'll miss you.

199
00:17:05,479 --> 00:17:07,324
Dude, that was a client?

200
00:17:07,348 --> 00:17:09,559
That's how bankings done, Keev.

201
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:12,162
Well, is she hot at least?

202
00:17:12,186 --> 00:17:13,663
He.

203
00:17:13,687 --> 00:17:15,232
Right.

204
00:17:15,256 --> 00:17:16,321
Okay.

205
00:17:18,526 --> 00:17:21,071
He's is Saylesburgh. I'll
never run into him in person.

206
00:17:21,095 --> 00:17:22,555
And if you do?

207
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:24,041
Ah, I guess I, uh,
take one for the team.

208
00:17:24,065 --> 00:17:26,610
Hahahahahahaha.

209
00:17:26,634 --> 00:17:28,578
That was my girlfriend,
She's back in Cali.

210
00:17:28,602 --> 00:17:30,113
Can we get,
can we get out of here?

211
00:17:30,137 --> 00:17:31,348
Fuck yeah.

212
00:17:31,372 --> 00:17:33,316
You guys give me
a couple minutes.

213
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,784
I'll meet ya downstairs.

214
00:17:34,808 --> 00:17:36,253
There's something I got to take
care of. You know, you know?

215
00:17:36,277 --> 00:17:38,188
- I just gotta.
- Uh.

216
00:17:38,212 --> 00:17:40,090
You wanna go fucking shoot some
guns? You wanna go kill some

217
00:17:40,114 --> 00:17:42,159
fucking animals? You wanna
kill Bambi, motherfucker?

218
00:17:42,183 --> 00:17:43,749
Come on, you fuck.

219
00:17:44,852 --> 00:17:46,762
What the hell was that?

220
00:17:46,786 --> 00:17:48,826
Oh, nothing. Don't worry
about it. Come on, come on.

221
00:17:52,626 --> 00:17:54,637
Ah.

222
00:17:54,661 --> 00:17:56,695
- Ahhhh. Shhhit.
- Hahahahahahaha.

223
00:17:59,433 --> 00:18:01,633
Ah, I don't even want to know.

224
00:18:03,471 --> 00:18:05,715
- You gonna wear that suit?
- No asshole.

225
00:18:05,739 --> 00:18:09,820
I'm gonna change in the car.
I figure It'd save us some time.

226
00:18:09,844 --> 00:18:12,444
Save time. Yeah, right.

227
00:18:24,658 --> 00:18:27,437
Oh dude! Sorry,
I just looked at your penis.

228
00:18:27,461 --> 00:18:30,373
Oh, haha. Call him,
eagle eyes. Hahaha.

229
00:18:30,397 --> 00:18:31,641
What are you ten,
you funny fucks?

230
00:18:31,665 --> 00:18:32,731
Uh-oh.

231
00:18:38,739 --> 00:18:43,120
Jeeesus. Look at the
bozongas on that one.

232
00:18:43,144 --> 00:18:45,255
- Oh hoho. Yeah.
- Cute.

233
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:48,158
Cute? No dude, she's a ten.

234
00:18:48,182 --> 00:18:50,594
- I don't know about that.
- Hohohoho.

235
00:18:50,618 --> 00:18:53,385
They are all tens on the inside.

236
00:18:55,322 --> 00:18:56,555
Jesus!

237
00:18:57,758 --> 00:18:59,491
Fucking asshole.

238
00:19:01,862 --> 00:19:03,372
Why don't you
roll down your window

239
00:19:03,396 --> 00:19:04,908
and yell it a little
louder so they can hear you.

240
00:19:04,932 --> 00:19:07,544
No, I'm, I'm good.
I got it out of my system.

241
00:19:07,568 --> 00:19:09,679
Yeah. Eye of the tiger, my ass.

242
00:19:09,703 --> 00:19:11,882
Look at you,
smiling, laughing there.

243
00:19:11,906 --> 00:19:15,218
- Actually having a good time.
- You know what, Trent?

244
00:19:15,242 --> 00:19:18,822
You might have a point. Bro's
weekend might do me some good.

245
00:19:18,846 --> 00:19:19,890
Fucker.

246
00:19:19,914 --> 00:19:23,715
Bro's weekend is back, woooo!

247
00:19:42,703 --> 00:19:45,849
So, I did some research
on this game preserve.

248
00:19:45,873 --> 00:19:48,585
There's not much out
there about this Foggy Creek.

249
00:19:48,609 --> 00:19:50,420
It's more of an urban myth.

250
00:19:50,444 --> 00:19:51,521
If you didn't know any better.

251
00:19:51,545 --> 00:19:54,291
What the fuck
are you talking about?

252
00:19:54,315 --> 00:19:56,381
We're going to a game preserve.

253
00:19:57,751 --> 00:20:01,298
Seriously Trent. You told me we
were going hiking and camping.

254
00:20:01,322 --> 00:20:05,202
Hunting too, if you want.
Or, or not if you don't.

255
00:20:05,226 --> 00:20:08,605
It's Morgan's thing. Come
on, it will be good for ya'.

256
00:20:08,629 --> 00:20:10,106
Eye of the tiger.

257
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:11,608
Don't start with that
eye of the tiger bullshit.

258
00:20:11,632 --> 00:20:13,743
- Did you find out where it is.
- Negatory.

259
00:20:13,767 --> 00:20:16,346
Ohhh! Seriously guys?

260
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:17,914
We don't even know
where the fuck we are going?

261
00:20:17,938 --> 00:20:21,685
We'll find it.
We'll just ask the locals.

262
00:20:21,709 --> 00:20:23,536
We're doing them a service.

263
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,388
Lack of predators. The
deer become overpopulated.

264
00:20:25,412 --> 00:20:28,447
The circle of life,
Buck. Things die.

265
00:20:32,386 --> 00:20:33,852
Sorry, man.

266
00:20:36,624 --> 00:20:38,468
What, you're not
gonna talk to me now?

267
00:20:38,492 --> 00:20:40,937
God damnit Buck.

268
00:20:40,961 --> 00:20:43,373
It's not your fault, okay?

269
00:20:43,397 --> 00:20:47,244
What happened to Cindy and
Roxanne was bad fucking luck.

270
00:20:47,268 --> 00:20:49,479
What happened
in the ring, bad fucking luck.

271
00:20:49,503 --> 00:20:52,231
And I'm worried about you.

272
00:20:52,255 --> 00:20:54,985
Bottom line, you should
have told me. Honestly fellas,

273
00:20:55,009 --> 00:20:57,320
I don't feel like being
around anybody killing anything

274
00:20:57,344 --> 00:20:58,622
right now.

275
00:20:58,646 --> 00:21:01,391
You're right.

276
00:21:01,415 --> 00:21:04,594
You want me to take you back?

277
00:21:04,618 --> 00:21:06,396
I don't know, maybe.

278
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,897
Come on, Buck.

279
00:21:07,921 --> 00:21:11,301
I haven't seen you since
the hospital. Three years.

280
00:21:11,325 --> 00:21:14,838
We'll hang tonight, roast
marshmallows. Drink a few beers.

281
00:21:14,862 --> 00:21:16,728
Fine. Whatever.

282
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:20,877
Good.

283
00:21:20,901 --> 00:21:24,803
- Hey, beer stop. Ten o'clock.
- Thank God.

284
00:21:36,817 --> 00:21:38,561
- Oh dude.
- What?

285
00:21:38,585 --> 00:21:40,930
Dude, there she is. Let me out.

286
00:21:40,954 --> 00:21:43,021
Well, at least let me...

287
00:21:43,891 --> 00:21:45,835
Stop.

288
00:21:45,859 --> 00:21:48,471
Crazy fucker.

289
00:21:48,495 --> 00:21:51,697
Ohh. Dirty girl.

290
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,874
Ah, you know what guys? I'm
just gonna stay with the car.

291
00:22:04,878 --> 00:22:08,892
Well, me and buds are
hanging out at Foggy Creek.

292
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:10,460
You should swing by.

293
00:22:10,484 --> 00:22:12,495
You know, have a drink.

294
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:15,532
Say, uh, you ever
heard of Buck Severs.

295
00:22:15,556 --> 00:22:17,033
Fuck yeah! You know him?

296
00:22:17,057 --> 00:22:20,070
Know him? He's one
of my best buddies.

297
00:22:20,094 --> 00:22:23,039
Yo Buck! Buck.

298
00:22:23,063 --> 00:22:26,710
Say hi to my new friend.

299
00:22:26,734 --> 00:22:29,079
Yeah. See that, right there?

300
00:22:29,103 --> 00:22:33,483
- Alright. I'm Brooklyn.
- Oh. Well, I heart NY.

301
00:22:33,507 --> 00:22:37,387
Hahahaha. Foggy Creek.
I will see you there.

302
00:22:37,411 --> 00:22:39,144
- Alright.
- Aight.

303
00:22:42,082 --> 00:22:43,615
Holdin' out.

304
00:22:46,687 --> 00:22:50,922
Yo, if I wasn't super cool, I
would kick your ass right now.

305
00:22:53,127 --> 00:22:54,393
Come on.

306
00:22:56,397 --> 00:22:57,796
Nice town.

307
00:23:04,138 --> 00:23:08,407
- Sure ain't the Four Seasons.
- Not even the two seasons.

308
00:23:10,911 --> 00:23:12,844
Ahh. Howdy gents?

309
00:23:17,151 --> 00:23:19,929
- Ol' Merl.
- Hehe, you betcha. Haha...

310
00:23:19,953 --> 00:23:22,699
Well, it is a pleasure
to make your acquaintance.

311
00:23:22,723 --> 00:23:24,167
Thank you.

312
00:23:24,191 --> 00:23:26,503
I will take some of
them fine hot dogs.

313
00:23:26,527 --> 00:23:28,894
Oh, that's fine
choice. Very fine choice.

314
00:23:33,434 --> 00:23:34,878
Your gonna eat that crap?

315
00:23:34,902 --> 00:23:36,112
They're all beef.

316
00:23:36,136 --> 00:23:38,715
No, no, no. They's meat.

317
00:23:38,739 --> 00:23:40,950
They's all meat.

318
00:23:40,974 --> 00:23:42,485
What's the difference?

319
00:23:42,509 --> 00:23:46,122
Beef is from a cow.
Meat ain't necessarily.

320
00:23:46,146 --> 00:23:47,590
Well, what the
hell's in them then.

321
00:23:47,614 --> 00:23:49,192
Well, first of all,
I just start choppin'...

322
00:23:49,216 --> 00:23:51,594
Whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Look,

323
00:23:51,618 --> 00:23:53,630
I don't want to know.

324
00:23:53,654 --> 00:23:56,733
Mystery meat is
my favorite kind.

325
00:23:56,757 --> 00:23:59,602
- I ain't touching that stuff.
- Ah, fuck it. I'll try em'.

326
00:23:59,626 --> 00:24:03,907
- Yeah. Haha.
- That's what I'm talking about.

327
00:24:03,931 --> 00:24:05,775
- What's the damage?
- Ahh...

328
00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:08,233
Dysentery, if you
eat those things.

329
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:11,236
Ohhh.

330
00:24:13,207 --> 00:24:16,041
Uhhh, thirty dollars even.

331
00:24:18,245 --> 00:24:19,911
Ah, thank you.

332
00:24:23,484 --> 00:24:25,750
- Ol' Merle.
- Young'en.

333
00:24:27,054 --> 00:24:30,066
I'm lookin' for
something with a little kick.

334
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:32,535
You'll have to
define kick for me.

335
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,737
Like a Mule. With a grudge.

336
00:24:34,761 --> 00:24:38,563
- Ee-heeheehee. Ah-hahaha.
- Hahahahahaha.

337
00:24:40,667 --> 00:24:42,745
Theeeeere you go.

338
00:24:42,769 --> 00:24:43,813
Hahaha.

339
00:24:43,837 --> 00:24:47,750
Please tell me you
brewed that in your bathtub.

340
00:24:47,774 --> 00:24:52,755
I brewed it in my bathtub. Hey,
I got some meth if ya' want it.

341
00:24:52,779 --> 00:24:54,691
No. No. Trying to cut down.

342
00:24:54,715 --> 00:24:57,594
Oh, okay. Well,
that's fair enough.

343
00:24:57,618 --> 00:25:00,029
Uh, is there
anything else I can get ya'?

344
00:25:00,053 --> 00:25:01,119
Yeah.

345
00:25:02,556 --> 00:25:05,123
You ever heard of
Foggy Creek Wildlife Preserve?

346
00:25:09,897 --> 00:25:11,941
No, I never heard of that.

347
00:25:11,965 --> 00:25:14,511
There's a Muskrat
Wildlife Preserve.

348
00:25:14,535 --> 00:25:17,780
Uh, good huntin'
up there at Muskrat.

349
00:25:17,804 --> 00:25:19,916
You heard of it?

350
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:22,018
- Well...
- I told you to shut up.

351
00:25:22,042 --> 00:25:23,920
- Now get out of here.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

352
00:25:23,944 --> 00:25:27,646
whoa, whoa, whoa.
Okay, okay. I'm sorry.

353
00:25:28,882 --> 00:25:31,661
You want to go and
get yourself dead,

354
00:25:31,685 --> 00:25:35,732
then you go right up
there to Foggy Creek.

355
00:25:35,756 --> 00:25:37,166
I thought you never heard of it.

356
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:39,869
Get out of here. Get your
stuff and head out of here.

357
00:25:39,893 --> 00:25:42,872
You ain't welcome here no more.
If you had half the brains

358
00:25:42,896 --> 00:25:45,575
you think you has, then you'd
get right back into your fancy

359
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:49,012
city car and you'd go right
back to where you come from.

360
00:25:49,036 --> 00:25:51,636
Now, get outta here.

361
00:25:53,173 --> 00:25:56,741
- Holy shit. Hahahahaha.
- That was awesome.

362
00:26:12,326 --> 00:26:16,839
- Sorry, I thought...
- He's going to kill you.

363
00:26:16,863 --> 00:26:18,523
Excuse me?

364
00:26:18,547 --> 00:26:20,209
He's going to hunt
you down and kill you.

365
00:26:20,233 --> 00:26:22,845
Hunt you like an animal.

366
00:26:22,869 --> 00:26:25,815
- Who?
- Jeb Tucker.

367
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:29,240
He's gonna kill you.
He's gonna kill you all.

368
00:26:30,877 --> 00:26:32,844
He-hey Buck, there you are.

369
00:26:36,116 --> 00:26:37,961
Did you see that?

370
00:26:37,985 --> 00:26:39,384
See what?

371
00:26:42,356 --> 00:26:43,788
Nevermind.

372
00:26:48,295 --> 00:26:52,208
Whoa, whoa, whoa,. Look, I want
to apologize for any trouble.

373
00:26:52,232 --> 00:26:53,832
It ain't nothing.

374
00:26:58,705 --> 00:26:59,938
That way?

375
00:27:02,209 --> 00:27:04,275
Fine, thanks.

376
00:27:13,286 --> 00:27:15,353
Just get in the car.

377
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,400
Hit it.

378
00:27:31,371 --> 00:27:32,437
Oww.

379
00:27:39,212 --> 00:27:41,980
Shit. God dammit.

380
00:27:44,885 --> 00:27:47,752
Pull over here.
Behind the trees.

381
00:28:02,302 --> 00:28:05,081
So, this is how it's gonna work.

382
00:28:05,105 --> 00:28:09,252
Ol' Merl, thinks the
halfwit gave us directions.

383
00:28:09,276 --> 00:28:13,011
So in effect, he's gonna
lead us right to Foggy Creek.

384
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:25,790
Ol' Merl, I presume.

385
00:28:39,372 --> 00:28:42,974
Check and mate. You old bastard.

386
00:29:20,347 --> 00:29:22,158
It's gotta be
around here somewhere.

387
00:29:22,182 --> 00:29:26,963
This is how you bankers think.
More or less. Same principles.

388
00:29:26,987 --> 00:29:29,132
Monetary fiscal cat and mouse.

389
00:29:29,156 --> 00:29:31,389
That's why we're
in a fuckin' recession.

390
00:29:32,993 --> 00:29:35,927
Uh-oh. Busted.

391
00:29:45,005 --> 00:29:46,449
There you are.

392
00:29:46,473 --> 00:29:48,818
You are not Old Merle.

393
00:29:48,842 --> 00:29:52,021
That is very nice of you to
notice. I been lookin' for you.

394
00:29:52,045 --> 00:29:54,991
I know you. I seen you on T.V.

395
00:29:55,015 --> 00:29:57,026
Haha. That's Buck Severs.

396
00:29:57,050 --> 00:30:00,029
I knew it. I knew it. Haha.

397
00:30:00,053 --> 00:30:03,266
Hey, we're lookin' for Foggy
Creek Wildlife Preserve.

398
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:07,570
Oh. Uhh, I don't go there.

399
00:30:07,594 --> 00:30:09,539
No one's really
supposed to go there.

400
00:30:09,563 --> 00:30:11,174
You know where we can find it?

401
00:30:11,198 --> 00:30:14,277
Yeah, uh, a-ha.
I don't know if I should say.

402
00:30:14,301 --> 00:30:17,814
You should come party
with us, is what you should do.

403
00:30:17,838 --> 00:30:19,448
Ugh, I don't know Foggy Creek...

404
00:30:19,472 --> 00:30:22,952
What? With Buck
Severs there to protect you?

405
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:25,822
- Uh, Yeah?
- Oh yeah, yeah.

406
00:30:25,846 --> 00:30:28,958
Okay. Alright, well, It's,
it's down this road about six

407
00:30:28,982 --> 00:30:31,294
miles. And when you get
to the old water tower, you turn

408
00:30:31,318 --> 00:30:34,397
left and when that
roads ends, you're there.

409
00:30:34,421 --> 00:30:37,533
Well, sweet. Then it is a date.

410
00:30:37,557 --> 00:30:40,303
- Uhh, okay.
- Bring some friends.

411
00:30:40,327 --> 00:30:42,271
Alright. Alright, good.

412
00:30:42,295 --> 00:30:43,528
Haha!

413
00:30:51,037 --> 00:30:56,107
Buck Severs is the
magic words to open legs.

414
00:30:57,177 --> 00:30:58,621
Ah. Oh, hey. Whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay.

415
00:30:58,645 --> 00:31:01,357
You're Buck Severs.
You're a chick magnet and if

416
00:31:01,381 --> 00:31:04,493
you're not going to partake,
then it's up to us not to let

417
00:31:04,517 --> 00:31:06,195
all that go to waste.

418
00:31:06,219 --> 00:31:10,099
Hey man. Don't look at me. I got
a chick back in Cali right now,

419
00:31:10,123 --> 00:31:11,400
but back in the day,

420
00:31:11,424 --> 00:31:13,202
- Holy shit.
- Hoohoohoohoo!

421
00:31:13,226 --> 00:31:15,271
Hahahahaha.

422
00:31:15,295 --> 00:31:16,939
- Uh. Oh.
- Good times

423
00:31:16,963 --> 00:31:19,130
Yes, indeed. Good times.

424
00:31:31,211 --> 00:31:32,355
That's it?

425
00:31:32,379 --> 00:31:35,358
Welcome to Foggy
Creek Wildlife Preserve.

426
00:31:35,382 --> 00:31:38,628
Place has been closed
for almost forty years.

427
00:31:38,652 --> 00:31:42,298
It's just us,
the guns, and the game.

428
00:31:42,322 --> 00:31:46,168
- No Rangers. No rules.
- Yeah, no trespassing.

429
00:31:46,192 --> 00:31:47,458
Fuck it.

430
00:31:50,163 --> 00:31:53,309
Good call Trent. Good call.

431
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:55,177
I thought this was your idea.

432
00:31:55,201 --> 00:31:58,281
Nah, Trent turned me on to it.

433
00:31:58,305 --> 00:32:00,438
I just got hooked.

434
00:32:06,112 --> 00:32:07,178
Ahh.

435
00:32:14,421 --> 00:32:15,486
Ahh.

436
00:33:00,233 --> 00:33:02,166
I gotta shake the weasel.

437
00:33:04,537 --> 00:33:05,770
Ughh.

438
00:33:07,407 --> 00:33:09,240
Ah, Shit.

439
00:33:10,543 --> 00:33:11,609
Pfft.

440
00:33:20,253 --> 00:33:23,666
Hey. Hey guys. Guys, look.

441
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:26,268
Jesus!

442
00:33:26,292 --> 00:33:28,403
Hey. Can y...

443
00:33:28,427 --> 00:33:30,539
- Hey hey hey, no fair.
- No fair, really?

444
00:33:30,563 --> 00:33:32,657
- Hey Keev.
- Yeah.

445
00:33:32,681 --> 00:33:34,777
Don't forget to put your
mouse back in the house.

446
00:33:34,801 --> 00:33:38,336
No shhhit. Ugh. Humph.

447
00:33:42,709 --> 00:33:45,121
Hit the safety, asshole.

448
00:33:45,145 --> 00:33:48,057
Oh, shit! Fuck.

449
00:33:48,081 --> 00:33:49,313
The fuck?

450
00:33:55,055 --> 00:33:57,733
Come on Buck, it's fine.
They're not gonna hit anything.

451
00:33:57,757 --> 00:34:01,492
Ay, you guys suck. You should
be ashamed of your selves.

452
00:34:02,462 --> 00:34:05,775
I missed on purpose, for Buck.

453
00:34:05,799 --> 00:34:07,793
Hahahahaha.

454
00:34:07,817 --> 00:34:09,812
Fucking pussy. He didn't
even get out of the car.

455
00:34:09,836 --> 00:34:12,748
MORGAN, BO, and TRENT:

456
00:34:12,772 --> 00:34:14,205
Asshole.

457
00:34:52,212 --> 00:34:56,158
- Look at this. Fucking right...
- Untouched by man fuckers.

458
00:34:56,182 --> 00:34:57,860
Great, check it out.

459
00:34:57,884 --> 00:35:00,151
- Let's do this.
- Ughh.

460
00:35:06,326 --> 00:35:09,405
Looks like a camp site.

461
00:35:09,429 --> 00:35:11,195
Let's do it fellas.

462
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:17,279
This is awesome. I feel like
fucking Ernest Hemingway.

463
00:35:17,303 --> 00:35:20,116
Hahahahaha.

464
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:23,452
Hey, hey. Now, Now
we're, "Ernest Goes to Camp".

465
00:35:23,476 --> 00:35:28,190
Hahahahaha ahh.
I never saw the hunting movie.

466
00:35:28,214 --> 00:35:30,593
But I know, I know
he, uhh, went to jail

467
00:35:30,617 --> 00:35:33,162
and then he joined
the army and got scared stupid.

468
00:35:33,186 --> 00:35:36,165
I said Ernest Hemingway.

469
00:35:36,189 --> 00:35:38,601
It's not the
saved Christmas guy?

470
00:35:38,625 --> 00:35:40,803
Are you, are, are you
really a fucking moron?

471
00:35:40,827 --> 00:35:44,540
Oh, oh. I got ya'. I'm sorry,

472
00:35:44,564 --> 00:35:48,377

Gay. Yeah, I, I know that.

473
00:35:48,401 --> 00:35:51,169
I know that. Haha, I know it.

474
00:35:53,373 --> 00:35:55,251
Incoming.

475
00:35:55,275 --> 00:35:56,941
Oh, beer me bro.

476
00:35:58,511 --> 00:36:01,924
Ah-hahahahaha. Oh Fuck!

477
00:36:01,948 --> 00:36:05,394
Brought you a tent and
I'll pitch it for you too.

478
00:36:05,418 --> 00:36:08,230
I know your walking
around like a walking dead.

479
00:36:08,254 --> 00:36:10,266
You're gonna
pitch a tent for me?

480
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:11,856
I always do.

481
00:36:53,333 --> 00:36:57,780
Ohh. Je... God.

482
00:36:57,804 --> 00:37:01,383
Oh Fuck. Hey.

483
00:37:01,407 --> 00:37:06,388
You. Hey. Morgan. Morgan,

00:37:06,412 --> 00:37:09,758

00:37:09,782 --> 00:37:12,561
It's Fine. Fine.
Fine. Put it on my tab.

486
00:37:12,585 --> 00:37:15,898
What part of four hundred bucks
don't you understand, fuckface?

487
00:37:15,922 --> 00:37:18,834
There, Ha. done.

488
00:37:18,858 --> 00:37:21,770
- Your castle awaits.
- Ah. Hahahaha.

489
00:37:21,794 --> 00:37:24,607
Assholes

490
00:37:24,631 --> 00:37:27,810
Alright.

491
00:37:27,834 --> 00:37:30,479
Ah. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha.

492
00:37:30,503 --> 00:37:32,603
- Get...

493
00:37:36,876 --> 00:37:37,853
Gee, thanks.

494
00:37:37,877 --> 00:37:40,522
Okay. Okay. Okay. Hey. Hey. Hey.

495
00:37:40,546 --> 00:37:44,526
A toast is in order I believe.

496
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:48,664
- Ughh.
- Okay Buck, I apologize-

497
00:37:48,688 --> 00:37:51,500
for my behavior earlier.

498
00:37:51,524 --> 00:37:53,936
I was, I was an asshole.

499
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,904
Here. Here.

500
00:37:55,928 --> 00:37:59,908
But we are here
this weekend, for you man.

501
00:37:59,932 --> 00:38:03,612
God, you always took care of
us back in the day, you know?

502
00:38:03,636 --> 00:38:08,350
You know, I owe my first,
my first car dealership to you.

503
00:38:08,374 --> 00:38:10,753
Man, you-

504
00:38:10,777 --> 00:38:13,689
you fronted me-

505
00:38:13,713 --> 00:38:15,479
the money-

506
00:38:16,616 --> 00:38:18,594
to start my dreams.

507
00:38:18,618 --> 00:38:22,064
And I am, I'm forever grateful.

508
00:38:22,088 --> 00:38:25,000
- You're drunk is what you are.
- Pffft. Hahaha.

509
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:29,071
Yeah, well, to Buck Severs!

510
00:38:29,095 --> 00:38:32,374
And his return to Bro's weekend!

511
00:38:32,398 --> 00:38:34,632
Buck Severs!

512
00:38:37,036 --> 00:38:40,805
I know, Cindy is
smiling down on you man.

513
00:38:43,343 --> 00:38:46,588
- Here. Here.
- More, more beers. Come on.

514
00:38:46,612 --> 00:38:48,524
Yup.

515
00:38:48,548 --> 00:38:50,826
So, uhh, who's hungry?

516
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:54,963
Oh my God. I could eat
the ass out of a skunk.

517
00:38:54,987 --> 00:38:56,965
How do you like
your meat though?

518
00:38:56,989 --> 00:39:01,036
Rare fucker.

519
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:04,106
Please tell me you
brought some real food.

520
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:07,443
Ha-ahahaha. What da'
ya' got? What da' ya' got?

521
00:39:07,467 --> 00:39:11,380
Yes, I will take one of those
medium rare but first fellas,

522
00:39:11,404 --> 00:39:14,038
I got to drain the
snake. I'll be right back.

523
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:25,916
Ughhh!

524
00:39:28,521 --> 00:39:31,922
Ohhhh.

525
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:37,428
- Ha Ha. Real funny guys.
- Reaaaal fucking funny.

526
00:40:18,037 --> 00:40:21,016
Hey guys, check this out.

527
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,653
Sex tape. Please,
please let it be a sex tape.

528
00:40:24,677 --> 00:40:26,321
It's not working.

529
00:40:26,345 --> 00:40:28,012
Looks like it's
been out here a while.

530
00:40:35,521 --> 00:40:37,922
Ohhhh. Yeah.

531
00:40:40,593 --> 00:40:45,129
Chicks with guns. Oh yeah.

532
00:40:46,666 --> 00:40:50,601
Fuck was that?

533
00:40:52,038 --> 00:40:53,782
Who's this?

534
00:40:53,806 --> 00:40:56,707
Oh, yeah.
It's the jailbait express.

535
00:41:12,859 --> 00:41:15,204
Oh, shit.

536
00:41:15,228 --> 00:41:18,106
Yo, when I said, bring friends,

537
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:20,609
I meant girls.

538
00:41:20,633 --> 00:41:22,544
Well. She's a girl.

539
00:41:22,568 --> 00:41:25,714
Oh, yeah? Prove it.

540
00:41:25,738 --> 00:41:27,549
He's gross.

541
00:41:27,573 --> 00:41:31,019
Come on. Everybody's welcome.

542
00:41:31,043 --> 00:41:35,757
We got steaks on the grill. Some
type of, some type of meat dog.

543
00:41:35,781 --> 00:41:39,683
We got beer and we
got old white lightning.

544
00:41:45,825 --> 00:41:49,593
- There we go. There we go.
- Hehehehehe.

545
00:41:52,598 --> 00:41:54,510
- Hahahaha.
- Pussies.

546
00:41:54,534 --> 00:41:56,667
Oh God!

547
00:42:01,574 --> 00:42:03,652
Arrrrghh.

548
00:42:03,676 --> 00:42:05,743
Ughhh!

549
00:42:09,749 --> 00:42:13,562
One more. I'm okay. One more.

550
00:42:13,586 --> 00:42:16,098
- Again.
- Ahh.

551
00:42:16,122 --> 00:42:18,100
Again.

552
00:42:18,124 --> 00:42:20,190
Again.

553
00:42:21,861 --> 00:42:24,306
Ughh.

554
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:25,596
Again.

555
00:42:26,198 --> 00:42:28,232
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

556
00:42:29,235 --> 00:42:30,301
Ggaahh.

557
00:42:35,875 --> 00:42:37,741
Ggg-Aahh.

558
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:44,927
I'm breathing fire.

559
00:42:44,951 --> 00:42:47,863
- Yeah and shitting soup.
- Hahahaha.

560
00:42:47,887 --> 00:42:51,600
It's good for you.
Flushes out the system.

561
00:42:51,624 --> 00:42:53,235
When you flush out the system,

562
00:42:53,259 --> 00:42:56,338
you should probably be
near something that flushes.

563
00:42:56,362 --> 00:42:59,296
Ughh. I'm going for another.

564
00:43:00,333 --> 00:43:04,935
Okay. Okay.
It's ghost story time.

565
00:43:06,238 --> 00:43:09,918
Tell us about, Jeb Tucker.

566
00:43:09,942 --> 00:43:13,322
Ooooh ooh-hoohoo.

567
00:43:13,346 --> 00:43:16,358
Just an urban legend.
Ain't no Jeb Tucker.

568
00:43:16,382 --> 00:43:18,760
Like hell there ain't.

569
00:43:18,784 --> 00:43:20,362
You tell it.

570
00:43:20,386 --> 00:43:23,198
No, you tell it.

571
00:43:23,222 --> 00:43:25,067
My grandpa was a kid then.

572
00:43:25,091 --> 00:43:27,736
Randall Tucker thought
his family owned this land so,

573
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:32,240
he just wouldn't leave. For like
twenty years, the whole family

574
00:43:32,264 --> 00:43:34,743
nobody could catch them.

575
00:43:34,767 --> 00:43:36,828
Then one day,

576
00:43:36,852 --> 00:43:38,914
Randall just, killed the
Ranger that lived here.

577
00:43:38,938 --> 00:43:43,085
Randall and Liza Tucker.
They were never found.

578
00:43:43,109 --> 00:43:45,220
Presumed missing.

579
00:43:45,244 --> 00:43:47,089
They got him.

580
00:43:47,113 --> 00:43:49,358
My dad said the locals got him.

581
00:43:49,382 --> 00:43:51,627
Lynched em up.

582
00:43:51,651 --> 00:43:54,930
My dad was a kid then.
He said he saw it himself.

583
00:43:54,954 --> 00:43:58,367
Tell us about Jeb Tucker.

584
00:43:58,391 --> 00:44:02,971
Nah. Just, just an urban
legend. Ain't no Jeb Tucker.

585
00:44:02,995 --> 00:44:04,995
Like hell their ain't.

586
00:44:06,999 --> 00:44:09,778
- Ahhhhhhh!! Ahhhhh!
- Ahhhh!

587
00:44:09,802 --> 00:44:13,815
Ahhhhhh! Ahhhhh!

588
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:18,020
- Ahhh. Hahahaha.
- Hahahahaha.

589
00:44:18,044 --> 00:44:21,890
Oh my God. Oh my God. I peed
my pants. I peed my pants.

590
00:44:21,914 --> 00:44:25,916
I peed my pants. Bravo. Bravo.

591
00:44:38,164 --> 00:44:42,711
Come on. Come on.
Let's get a little...

592
00:44:42,735 --> 00:44:47,015
No. No. No. I'll, I'll, Ill
catch up with you later.

593
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:49,773
No. No, no, no, no, no.

594
00:45:07,259 --> 00:45:10,038
Ahh-ha.

595
00:45:10,062 --> 00:45:12,841
- Thanks Mr. Severs.
- Ah, call me Buck.

596
00:45:12,865 --> 00:45:14,843
Mr. Severs is
your dad right?

597
00:45:14,867 --> 00:45:17,713
Actually my dad
is Mr. Mutnanski.

598
00:45:17,737 --> 00:45:18,880
W-W-What?

599
00:45:18,904 --> 00:45:21,249
Forget it.
Where'd your boyfriend get to?

600
00:45:21,273 --> 00:45:24,419
Oh hell. He ain't my boyfriend.

601
00:45:24,443 --> 00:45:26,955
Pretty slim pickins
in the local gene pool, huh?

602
00:45:26,979 --> 00:45:30,225
You have no idea.

603
00:45:30,249 --> 00:45:33,417
Your friend's pretty wasted.

604
00:45:37,423 --> 00:45:41,770
He's gonna poo
in your beer cooler.

605
00:45:41,794 --> 00:45:45,763
Excuse me.

606
00:45:49,101 --> 00:45:51,268
Psssst. Kitty.

607
00:45:53,372 --> 00:45:56,485
God damn it Cutter, what?

608
00:45:56,509 --> 00:45:59,109
Come here.

609
00:46:10,923 --> 00:46:12,400
Yeah? Or what?

610
00:46:12,424 --> 00:46:15,237
- Or Jeb Tuckers gonna get ya'.
- Ahhh!

611
00:46:15,261 --> 00:46:18,328
Heehee

612
00:46:20,833 --> 00:46:22,844
There is a way
to keep old Jeb away.

613
00:46:22,868 --> 00:46:25,113
Oh yeah, what's that?

614
00:46:25,137 --> 00:46:27,149
Havin' sex.

615
00:46:27,173 --> 00:46:29,918
- You know what he hates most?
- What?

616
00:46:29,942 --> 00:46:31,887
- Titties
- Yeah?

617
00:46:31,911 --> 00:46:35,524
So, if I were to go like this,

618
00:46:35,548 --> 00:46:38,093
- that would keep Jeb away.
- Yep.

619
00:46:38,117 --> 00:46:39,361
- Yeah?
- Mhmm.

620
00:46:39,385 --> 00:46:41,363
You know what
he even hates more than that?

621
00:46:41,387 --> 00:46:44,299
- What? Ahha.
- Pootang.

622
00:46:44,323 --> 00:46:47,391
Oh yeah, should I?

623
00:47:03,542 --> 00:47:05,320
What was that?

624
00:47:05,344 --> 00:47:07,122
It's my beating heart baby.

625
00:47:07,146 --> 00:47:08,957
No, I, I think
I heard something.

626
00:47:08,981 --> 00:47:13,483
No. My heart, listen.

627
00:47:16,455 --> 00:47:19,523
Ughhh-ha.

628
00:47:31,103 --> 00:47:34,304
Ahhhhhhhh!

629
00:47:42,248 --> 00:47:46,316
Ughh-uh. Ugh-ahh.
Ughh-ahh. Ughhhh

630
00:47:56,462 --> 00:47:58,073
Where are you?

631
00:47:58,097 --> 00:48:02,077
Ughh. Ahh. I'm over here.

632
00:48:02,101 --> 00:48:04,012
Ughh. Ahh.

633
00:48:04,036 --> 00:48:06,615
What?

634
00:48:06,639 --> 00:48:10,085
Oh, Jesus Cutter. Will you
put your damn pants back on?

635
00:48:10,109 --> 00:48:12,520
- Get in here with me.
- Hell no!

636
00:48:12,544 --> 00:48:14,990
Please?

637
00:48:15,014 --> 00:48:17,592
Pretty please?

638
00:48:17,616 --> 00:48:22,464
Oh damn it Cutter.
Is that all you got?

639
00:48:22,488 --> 00:48:25,033
Oh Kitty,
It's freezing and cold out here.

640
00:48:25,057 --> 00:48:28,570
- Ha. Ha.
- You bitch.

641
00:48:28,594 --> 00:48:30,639
I don't want you anyway.

642
00:48:30,663 --> 00:48:35,599
Ah Hell. Shhhhit.

643
00:48:40,306 --> 00:48:42,350
No.

644
00:48:42,374 --> 00:48:44,574
No. Fuck. God. No!

645
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:52,160
Fuck.

646
00:48:52,184 --> 00:48:54,251
Ahhhhhh!

647
00:48:58,424 --> 00:49:00,702
- It's just me.
- Tchhh.

648
00:49:00,726 --> 00:49:03,705
I was wondering where
you went. Let me walk you back.

649
00:49:03,729 --> 00:49:05,974
I really want to pick your
brain a little bit about the old

650
00:49:05,998 --> 00:49:07,142
Jeb Tucker myth.

651
00:49:07,166 --> 00:49:08,977
What do you want to know?

652
00:49:09,001 --> 00:49:12,080
See, Backwoods, Pennsylvania.

653
00:49:12,104 --> 00:49:15,417
No offense. Two kids.

654
00:49:15,441 --> 00:49:18,386
Randall and Liza. Living in
the woods for twenty years.

655
00:49:18,410 --> 00:49:21,256
- Right?
- It is just a story.

656
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:25,382
Nahhh. Story had to
come from somewhere.

657
00:49:30,622 --> 00:49:34,524
Hello? Hello?

658
00:49:35,461 --> 00:49:38,528
You're Jeb Tucker.

659
00:49:39,264 --> 00:49:41,209
Don't. Don't.

660
00:49:41,233 --> 00:49:44,346
I just, I just want to
talk to him. This is huge.

661
00:49:44,370 --> 00:49:46,481
This is like finding Bigfoot.

662
00:49:46,505 --> 00:49:49,517
Nobody's gonna get hurt here.
We got this under control.

663
00:49:49,541 --> 00:49:52,754
No, you are an arrogant son of
a bitch. You know that, right.

664
00:49:52,778 --> 00:49:54,556
- I try my best.
- Are you crazy?

665
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:56,841
We gotta get out of here.

666
00:49:56,865 --> 00:49:59,127
He doesn't even have
his bow off his shoulder.

667
00:49:59,151 --> 00:50:01,696
It's cool man.
Everything's cool.

668
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:04,699
No one's gonna... Ahh-ahhhh!

669
00:50:04,723 --> 00:50:08,436
Ugh. Ah-ughhh. Ahhh!

670
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:12,396
- Ughh! Ugh. Ugh. Ugh.
- Ahh. Ahh. Ughhh.

671
00:50:57,609 --> 00:51:00,110
No. No. No. No. No.

672
00:51:05,484 --> 00:51:07,551
Ugh-ughh.

673
00:51:22,668 --> 00:51:23,733
Ugh.

674
00:51:25,104 --> 00:51:28,216
You look like a gay Rambo.

675
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:31,553
I'm the only one out here with
any real survival instincts.

676
00:51:31,577 --> 00:51:33,176
Since when?

677
00:51:37,583 --> 00:51:41,596
See that? When I was a boy,
I had this German shepherd.

678
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:44,232
Beautiful dog.
Named him Byron.

679
00:51:44,256 --> 00:51:46,601
That's a good German name.

680
00:51:46,625 --> 00:51:49,737
I really did.
You remember my dad.

681
00:51:49,761 --> 00:51:52,707
Oh, yeah.

682
00:51:52,731 --> 00:51:56,544
So he starves Byron for like,

683
00:51:56,568 --> 00:51:58,646
five days.

684
00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:01,783
Then he takes me
out to the barn.

685
00:52:01,807 --> 00:52:06,121
Byron's there,
chained to the post.

686
00:52:06,145 --> 00:52:07,889
Rip me to shreds.

687
00:52:07,913 --> 00:52:10,892
I'm sitting there and
I'm crying my eyes out

688
00:52:10,916 --> 00:52:13,495
and my father smacks me
and says, "Let's see who"

689
00:52:13,519 --> 00:52:16,431
the master is".

690
00:52:16,455 --> 00:52:20,835
He hands me a
knife and he sets Byron Free.

691
00:52:20,859 --> 00:52:23,872
Byron knocks me on my ass.

692
00:52:23,896 --> 00:52:27,242
I'm kicking and screaming and
he's trying to rip my throat out

693
00:52:27,266 --> 00:52:30,545
and, and suddenly, I snapped.

694
00:52:30,569 --> 00:52:34,504
All of a sudden,
it, it all made sense.

695
00:52:36,341 --> 00:52:40,410
So I took that knife
and I cut Byron open.

696
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:43,458
Throat to tail.

697
00:52:43,482 --> 00:52:46,294
No offense but your
dad was an asshole.

698
00:52:46,318 --> 00:52:50,231
My dad was a genius.

699
00:52:50,255 --> 00:52:53,168
That night taught
me to take charge.

700
00:52:53,192 --> 00:52:57,939
I've gotten anything
I've ever set my mind to.

701
00:52:57,963 --> 00:53:01,643
I got a whole new
project I'm working on.

702
00:53:01,667 --> 00:53:05,413
Ooh-hoo-hoo.

703
00:53:05,437 --> 00:53:08,416
Something special.

704
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:11,452
Yeah, what's that?

705
00:53:11,476 --> 00:53:14,411
Ooh. In due time.

706
00:53:29,661 --> 00:53:33,241
Oh dear God!
Oh God damn it Buck.

707
00:53:33,265 --> 00:53:35,243
Are you trying to
give me a heart attack?

708
00:53:35,267 --> 00:53:36,778
No comment.

709
00:53:36,802 --> 00:53:40,682
Yeah, okay, I deserve that.

710
00:53:40,706 --> 00:53:41,771
Buck,

711
00:53:43,642 --> 00:53:45,587
you have no idea.

712
00:53:45,611 --> 00:53:47,922
It's bullshit.

713
00:53:47,946 --> 00:53:50,458
It's all bullshit!

714
00:53:50,482 --> 00:53:53,328
The dealership is shhhhit.

715
00:53:53,352 --> 00:53:57,565
My wife, my wife left me.

716
00:53:57,589 --> 00:54:01,302
God, I haven't
been laid in, in months.

717
00:54:01,326 --> 00:54:04,005
- How many?
- Twenty. Give or take.

718
00:54:04,029 --> 00:54:06,908
Uh, give mostly.

719
00:54:06,932 --> 00:54:10,311
You don't know shame
till you get rejected by some

720
00:54:10,335 --> 00:54:13,848
fat, Seth Rogan looking
bitch in the middle of a

721
00:54:13,872 --> 00:54:16,985
fucking Cinnabon, man.

722
00:54:17,009 --> 00:54:19,887
That's a family establishment.

723
00:54:19,911 --> 00:54:23,658
It's a place of goodness
and, and, and, and, and...

724
00:54:23,682 --> 00:54:25,827
- And buns!
- And buns! Fuck yeah! And buns

725
00:54:25,851 --> 00:54:27,550
and buns.

726
00:54:35,427 --> 00:54:39,474
- It's okay, come on.
- Buck, she had a beard.

727
00:54:39,498 --> 00:54:41,064
It's okay. It's okay.

728
00:55:06,058 --> 00:55:08,436
Oh! Ohhh.

729
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:11,695
Ohhh goddd.

730
00:55:12,898 --> 00:55:15,632
Ahh, who shit in my mouth?

731
00:55:17,602 --> 00:55:19,602
Hooooo.

732
00:55:22,074 --> 00:55:23,340
Haaa.

733
00:55:25,744 --> 00:55:27,977
Ughh. Jesus.

734
00:55:32,718 --> 00:55:34,896
Hey.

735
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:38,333
Rise and shine dickhead.

736
00:55:38,357 --> 00:55:40,335
Smell the fresh mountain air.

737
00:55:40,359 --> 00:55:42,503
Prrrrfftt.

738
00:55:42,527 --> 00:55:44,605
Ohh. Oh.

739
00:55:44,629 --> 00:55:47,597
Oh, that's gonna hurt. Ughh.

740
00:55:51,603 --> 00:55:54,916
- Ohh.
- Oh my God. Ughh-ohh. Oh!

741
00:55:54,940 --> 00:55:59,120
- Oh. Ahh. Ohhh. Je-sus!
- Hahahahaha.

742
00:55:59,144 --> 00:56:04,147
- Dude, that wasn't even funny.
- Ahhhh. Ohh.

743
00:56:05,384 --> 00:56:06,894
Where's Morgan?

744
00:56:06,918 --> 00:56:08,685
He's not in his tent?

745
00:56:10,822 --> 00:56:12,433
Anybody see him
come back last night?

746
00:56:12,457 --> 00:56:15,403
Oh man. If he
banged that Kitty,

747
00:56:15,427 --> 00:56:18,806
I am gonna be so hurt.

748
00:56:18,830 --> 00:56:20,597
Kitty isn't here either.

749
00:56:22,934 --> 00:56:26,681
And the guns.
Where are the guns?

750
00:56:26,705 --> 00:56:28,416
No, they're right over th...

751
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:32,620
Mother, motherfffffucker!

752
00:56:32,644 --> 00:56:37,158
God damnit. Those
punks stole our guns. Shit.

753
00:56:37,182 --> 00:56:40,495
- Well you fucking invited them.
- Yeah, well you got them here.

754
00:56:40,519 --> 00:56:43,931
I am so sick of
you using my name

755
00:56:43,955 --> 00:56:46,067
for your statutory rapes.

756
00:56:46,091 --> 00:56:49,804
Wow. He's just now
figuring this out.

757
00:56:49,828 --> 00:56:52,540
Ugh. Ugh. Ughh.

758
00:56:52,564 --> 00:56:55,810
Yeah, Buck the thing is,

759
00:56:55,834 --> 00:56:59,714
those wrestling moves,
they're really just for show.

760
00:56:59,738 --> 00:57:02,917
I wonder how you
would do in a real fight?

761
00:57:02,941 --> 00:57:05,720
- You wanna fucking find out?
- Woah, woah, woah, woah.

762
00:57:05,744 --> 00:57:08,022
Woah.

763
00:57:08,046 --> 00:57:10,780
- Jesus, look at you.
- I told you. I told you.

764
00:57:12,784 --> 00:57:15,096
We have to find Morgan.

765
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:17,899
I'm telling you fellas, I don't
have a good feeling about this.

766
00:57:17,923 --> 00:57:20,802
He's fine. Alright?

767
00:57:20,826 --> 00:57:22,158
Morgan's fine.

768
00:57:23,562 --> 00:57:26,207
I'm going back to bed.

769
00:57:26,231 --> 00:57:29,844
- Buck!
- We're looking for Morgan.

770
00:57:29,868 --> 00:57:32,802
You got that? Here's the plan.

771
00:57:34,139 --> 00:57:36,884
We all split up. If we
don't find him by sundown,

772
00:57:36,908 --> 00:57:39,187
we're gonna meet back
here and do it all over again.

773
00:57:39,211 --> 00:57:41,189
Got it?

774
00:57:41,213 --> 00:57:43,691
Trent, you go that way.

775
00:57:43,715 --> 00:57:45,014
Let's go!

776
00:57:57,762 --> 00:57:58,995
Morgan!

777
00:58:01,933 --> 00:58:03,166
Morgan!

778
00:58:12,811 --> 00:58:13,877
Oh.

779
00:58:37,636 --> 00:58:40,270
Ughh. Ahh.

780
00:59:36,695 --> 00:59:37,927
Morgan.

781
01:00:06,157 --> 01:00:07,223
Buck?

782
01:00:43,094 --> 01:00:44,794
Mhhh.

783
01:01:38,283 --> 01:01:39,482
Morgan!

784
01:01:51,496 --> 01:01:55,164
Oh God. Hhm-hmm.
Oh God. Hhm.

785
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:57,400
Ugh. Ugh.

786
01:02:20,225 --> 01:02:22,291
- Ughh.
- Agh.

787
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:31,300
Ah. Ah-ah. Ah-ah.

788
01:02:40,245 --> 01:02:41,956
He-he-he-help me.

789
01:02:41,980 --> 01:02:44,358
N-no, no, no!

790
01:02:44,382 --> 01:02:47,361
Morgan!

791
01:02:47,385 --> 01:02:50,831
Seriously? Jesus Christ.

792
01:02:50,855 --> 01:02:52,355
What the?

793
01:04:58,549 --> 01:05:00,549
Ahhhh! Ughh!

794
01:05:01,219 --> 01:05:02,652
Ughh!

795
01:05:10,528 --> 01:05:13,941
I learned that from Mania 23,
when I had to rope Buffalo Bob

796
01:05:13,965 --> 01:05:17,378
with his own lasso.

797
01:05:17,402 --> 01:05:18,467
Ohh.

798
01:05:35,053 --> 01:05:37,031
Buck Seavers. In the flesh.

799
01:05:37,055 --> 01:05:39,967
Thank God you're here. I'm
in a world of hurt over there.

800
01:05:39,991 --> 01:05:41,702
You have no idea.

801
01:05:41,726 --> 01:05:43,659
Whoa-hoa-hoa-hoa.

802
01:05:45,096 --> 01:05:46,273
Ohh!

803
01:05:46,297 --> 01:05:48,108
Look around, there's three more.

804
01:05:48,132 --> 01:05:51,078
- He's o... He's over there.
- Who?

805
01:05:51,102 --> 01:05:53,580
- Hurry up. He's getting away.
- Buck up!

806
01:05:53,604 --> 01:05:57,540
- Ughhh!
- Keep an eye on him. Let's go.

807
01:06:00,445 --> 01:06:02,556
Woohoo!

808
01:06:02,580 --> 01:06:04,091
Fuck these guys.

809
01:06:04,115 --> 01:06:05,993
Are you really Buck Severs?

810
01:06:06,017 --> 01:06:08,084
- Ughh.
- What?

811
01:06:08,286 --> 01:06:09,352
Ughh!

812
01:06:16,661 --> 01:06:18,494
- Arrghh Arrrraaghh.
- Ugh-ahh.

813
01:06:38,549 --> 01:06:39,615
Shit!

814
01:06:42,587 --> 01:06:44,398
- Ughh.
- Ughhh.

815
01:06:44,422 --> 01:06:46,222
Ohhhh!

816
01:06:49,293 --> 01:06:52,239
Heeyaa!

817
01:06:52,263 --> 01:06:55,598
- Ahhh! Ahh!
- Ughh. Ahh. Ughh. Ahh!

818
01:07:03,107 --> 01:07:04,340
Aghhh.

819
01:07:06,511 --> 01:07:07,576
Ughh.

820
01:07:09,414 --> 01:07:11,392
Aghh.

821
01:07:11,416 --> 01:07:15,763
Aghhh.

822
01:07:15,787 --> 01:07:17,053
Ughh.

823
01:07:18,089 --> 01:07:19,155
Ahhh.

824
01:07:50,688 --> 01:07:52,699
Go wait in the
trees behind the cabin.

825
01:07:52,723 --> 01:07:54,334
Wait for me there.

826
01:07:54,358 --> 01:07:55,636
There's another girl in there.

827
01:07:55,660 --> 01:07:57,671
- Where?
- In there.

828
01:07:57,695 --> 01:07:59,295
Go. Go.

829
01:08:04,135 --> 01:08:05,201
Ugh.

830
01:08:09,273 --> 01:08:10,706
Shhhhhhh.

831
01:08:16,414 --> 01:08:17,691
Get me out of here.

832
01:08:17,715 --> 01:08:18,781
Shhh.

833
01:08:21,586 --> 01:08:23,185
Ughhh-uhh.

834
01:08:26,491 --> 01:08:28,469
- Ah.
- Ugh! Ugh!

835
01:08:28,493 --> 01:08:30,737
Ughh-ahh. Come on.

836
01:08:30,761 --> 01:08:34,396
Come on,
It's okay, I got you. Come.

837
01:08:48,546 --> 01:08:51,280
Oh God. It's him.

838
01:08:56,921 --> 01:08:58,354
Stay there.

839
01:09:06,631 --> 01:09:08,864
That fucker's calling me out.

840
01:09:11,869 --> 01:09:14,770
That motherfucker's
calling me out.

841
01:09:18,776 --> 01:09:20,543
Where are you going?

842
01:09:22,213 --> 01:09:23,779
Please don't leave me.

843
01:09:25,483 --> 01:09:27,227
Can you make it
back to the campsite?

844
01:09:27,251 --> 01:09:29,663
- Think so.
- Okay. Come on. Come on.

845
01:09:29,687 --> 01:09:31,899
Nahh. Yeah,
I don't think I can walk.

846
01:09:31,923 --> 01:09:35,802
Okay, okay. Just stay
there. Go. Go. Go. Go.

847
01:09:35,826 --> 01:09:37,226
Stay there.

848
01:09:56,614 --> 01:09:58,625
Ughhhh!

849
01:09:58,649 --> 01:10:00,249
Grrrr.

850
01:10:05,590 --> 01:10:07,957
- Arrrrggggg.
- Rrrraaah.

851
01:10:13,965 --> 01:10:17,233
Rrrrraahh!

852
01:10:19,237 --> 01:10:21,215
Aahhhh.

853
01:10:21,239 --> 01:10:22,438
Ugggghh!

854
01:10:25,643 --> 01:10:28,244
- Uwaaahh.
- Ohhh!

855
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:31,013
Ahh.

856
01:10:37,355 --> 01:10:38,988
Aghh!

857
01:10:41,892 --> 01:10:43,926
Grrrrrrr.

858
01:10:45,630 --> 01:10:47,997
Gggrrrrrrr.

859
01:10:50,401 --> 01:10:53,480
Ohhhh!

860
01:10:53,504 --> 01:10:55,471
Ohhh. Oh. Ho. Ho. Ho.

861
01:10:59,043 --> 01:11:01,944
Ughh. Ohh. Ohh.

862
01:11:07,285 --> 01:11:08,817
Ooooooh!

863
01:11:27,672 --> 01:11:29,471
Ahhhhhhh!

864
01:11:37,448 --> 01:11:39,982
- Ugh. Ahh.
- Ughh.

865
01:11:57,802 --> 01:12:01,003
Oh, fuck. God damnit.

866
01:12:46,751 --> 01:12:49,818
Inbred mutant
looking motherfucker!

867
01:12:52,390 --> 01:12:54,368
Come on motherfucker.

868
01:12:54,392 --> 01:12:57,593
Loud smash

869
01:13:28,058 --> 01:13:31,160
Let's dance motherfucker.

870
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:32,686
That's Aunty Liza.

871
01:16:32,710 --> 01:16:34,276
My dad's cousin.

872
01:16:35,746 --> 01:16:37,791
And sister.

873
01:16:37,815 --> 01:16:41,895
And their parents were to.
Jeb, you met Jeb. Uhh.

874
01:16:41,919 --> 01:16:43,163
Their son.

875
01:16:43,187 --> 01:16:46,900
Oma Jean here is Jeb's wife.

876
01:16:46,924 --> 01:16:48,935
And the kids.

877
01:16:48,959 --> 01:16:53,028
And the grandkids
aren't doing so well.

878
01:16:54,965 --> 01:16:58,144
Which is why we have
to get new blood in here.

879
01:16:58,168 --> 01:17:00,981
Hence those girls you let go.

880
01:17:01,005 --> 01:17:04,951
But we'll get 'em
