1
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,320
We open now at 2 draw.

2
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,360
I'm number 3 buy-in.

3
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,760
On the 10 draw, G-V-U, please.

4
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,600
- G-V-U.
- J-R-C.

5
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,920
We open now at 2 draw. 2 and 4 draw seen.

6
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,920
5 and 10 draw. She opens 5 runs.

7
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,800
# Cowboys #

8
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,400
# Pay for the jukebox #

9
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,920
#Well, I know #

10
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,400
#Her life ain't been easy #

11
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,040
#But the light in her fa... #

12
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,600
Sorry.

13
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,400
Give me a 5 draw, please.

14
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,360
Take the seat right here, sir.

15
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:08,240
#In the lights of Texas they saw me #

16
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,480
#But she won't sit down at your table #

17
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,840
#And I know that you can't hold her hand #

18
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,160
Starting a new game
now. Playing blind 5s and 10s.

19
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,560
The game... 5-blind, lowball.

20
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,920
#You'll look at me #

21
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,720
#And you will know our love was #

22
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,400
#Meant to be #

23
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,000
#One fine day #

24
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:10,040
#You're gonna want me for your girl ##

25
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,640
We got a 211 in progress.

26
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,680
All right.

27
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,680
South side, near Lincoln.

28
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,240
- Casino.
- You called it.

29
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,000
Four units on their way.

30
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,520
Driver: Male,
Caucasian, late 20s, sandy wavy hair.

31
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,440
- That's him.
- Yeah.

32
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,600
Same goddamn stunt he pulled six weeks ago.

33
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,280
You two wanna tell me
who we're talking about?

34
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,040
Shut up. I want to hear this.

35
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,680
Look out.!

36
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,480
Look out!

37
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,880
Look out, look out!

38
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,320
Turn it.! Look out.!

39
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,880
Aaah!

40
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,440
God! Turn it! Look out!

41
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,640
All units in the vicinity...

42
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,160
3849 reports that the police units
pursuing suspects'vehicle...

43
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,880
were involved in a traffic accident...

44
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,800
at Pruitt and 34th Street.

45
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,080
Poker Palace first. You call in.

46
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,840
Ahhh. 1-Y-10, Code 6. 813 North Cleveland.

47
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,800
$23,500.

48
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:53,800
Are you sure none of those people
got a good look at you?

49
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:57,720
You see, we wanna keep you healthy
for next time.

50
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,720
There isn't going to be any next time.

51
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,400
You were late.

52
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,560
Well, well, well. Lookee here.

53
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,320
- Cowboy.
- No shit.

54
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,480
Well?

55
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,840
It kind of looks like him to me.

56
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,440
You sure?

57
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,640
Can't say for sure.

58
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,720
What about you?

59
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,840
You know,
I just didn't get that good a look at him.

60
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,960
You?

61
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,800
She saw him better than I did.

62
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,120
- Who?
- She did.

63
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,200
- What do you mean, "she"?
- On the end.

64
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,120
In the black?

65
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,680
Is that him?

66
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,160
You can take your time, because
there's no way he can ever get to you...

67
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,160
absolutely no way.

68
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,360
It wasn't him.

69
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,360
You sure?

70
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,400
Yeah.

71
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,480
You're positive?

72
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,320
It wasn't him.

73
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:05,320
How about the rest of you?
Guide dogs for everyone, is that it? Huh?

74
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,840
Planning on looking for work soon?

75
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,280
My line of work is kinda hard to come by.

76
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,240
Depends on where you look.

77
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,480
It depends on who you are.

78
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,160
I don't know.

79
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,080
Some of the criminal types these days...

80
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,480
they, uh, think that
they're real cowboys...

81
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:48,240
think that they can
just, uh, drive around...

82
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,280
do whatever they want to do...

83
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,400
whenever they wanna do it.

84
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,400
Mm.

85
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,800
I respect a man that's
good at what he does.

86
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,600
I'll tell you something else.

87
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,120
I'm very good at what I do.

88
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,400
Now, last night...

89
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,320
Oh, I forgot.

90
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,000
His memory's not too good
about last night.

91
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,920
- I remember everything.
- Alone in your room?

92
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,840
Yeah.

93
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,520
You can do better than that.

94
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,440
I don't have to.

95
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,600
Go ahead throw it!
It'll cost you two years.

96
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,280
Go on.

97
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,560
You wanna throw it?
Go on. Go on.

98
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,920
Go on.

99
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,240
You know what I'm gonna do?

100
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:07,040
I'm gonna catch the cowboy
that's never been caught.

101
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,880
Cowboy desperado.

102
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,960
Now get out of here.

103
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,920
- You all set?
- Yeah.

104
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,200
- How about you?
- Yeah.

105
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,680
- You sure?
- Sure.

106
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,520
Open the door!

107
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,920
Can't you open the goddamn door?

108
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,120
You asshole!
Can't you even open the door?

109
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,080
Drive, you son of a bitch! Drive!

110
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,720
Watch it! Watch that damn truck!

111
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,840
Watch it! Jesus!

112
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,920
Well, well, well.

113
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,360
Look what the old van drug in.

114
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,600
What kind of piece did he have?

115
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,520
Wow!.45.

116
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,840
Very nice gun.

117
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,280
You know, that supermarket's
gonna cost you 10 years.

118
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,440
I don't know about any supermarket.

119
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,960
Yeah, you do.
Why don'tcha come on inside?

120
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,200
- How about a beer?
- I'd rather not, if that's okay by you.

121
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,760
Well, it's fine by me.

122
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,080
Today's your lucky day.
I'm feeling generous.

123
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,400
I'm gonna give you a choice.

124
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,000
You and your bunch are
gonna do one more job...

125
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,600
a bank, nice big one...

126
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,480
for free.

127
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,400
You're gonna hire a new driver, that's all.

128
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,320
A good one.

129
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,960
I don't work with cops.

130
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,800
Oh, gosh.

131
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,840
I wish you hadn't said that.

132
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:00,320
Ow! God damn you!

133
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,760
Now, about this bank.

134
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,680
Cash on hand: 200,000.

135
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,520
That's bait for the man you're gonna hire.

136
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,640
He does know banks.

137
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,160
You set it up in a week or you're...

138
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,240
Yeah, I know all about 10 years.

139
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,360
Well, that's the choice.

140
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,720
Do 10 years wearing a number...

141
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,360
or trust me...

142
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,760
and walk away free.

143
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,720
- You're getting in pretty deep on this
one, aren't you? - That's my business.

144
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:40,440
Setting up bank jobs? I don't remember
that being part of taking the oath.

145
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,640
We're getting the money back, jerk-off.

146
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,680
And we're catching somebody
that's never been caught.

147
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,680
That's a public service.

148
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,400
How many banks in this city...

149
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,320
get hit every month?

150
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,800
Oh, 15, on the average.

151
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,760
How many end up with a collar?

152
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,640
On the average?
About eight or nine.

153
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,880
See there?
We're raising the average.

154
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,280
Brilliant.
Try to sell that downtown.

155
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,800
I sold it to myself, that's enough.
I want the cowboy.

156
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,320
You wanna play this your way?
Fine. You're the boss.

157
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,880
But I'm telling you something:
I'm in this for the win.

158
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,960
You blow this thing then you can
say good-bye to your badge.

159
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,280
You know something? Maybe I oughta
investigate your background, huh?

160
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,400
Did you ever think of that?
Some little item there?

161
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,960
Maybe there's something we should
know about. Maybe you're a fruiter.

162
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,880
- Yeah.
- Or maybe you took a bribe.

163
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,800
- I wonder how much it was.
- Investigate all you want.

164
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,680
- You'd just be disappointed. - I'm not
gonna take your word for it. How's that?

165
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,120
I got a wife and I got a kid and I got
12 years' service toward a pension.

166
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,200
Now, if you think I'm gonna
let you blow that for me, you're crazy.

167
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,840
- Think about it.
- I already have...

168
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,200
asshole.

169
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,400
I didn't think you'd be the one to pay me.

170
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,720
Kind of taking a chance, aren't you?

171
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,720
I'll pay you here if you want.

172
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,240
Come on up.

173
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:52,040
I've been paid to do a few things before...

174
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,920
but I was never paid to be an alibi.

175
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,280
You're going to ask me why I did it?

176
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,640
I have a friend that pays the rent...

177
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,640
lives out of town...

178
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,120
visits me once or twice a month.

179
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,640
Lately the checks haven't been so regular.

180
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,280
I need the money.

181
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,080
Hello.

182
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,720
No, I don't think...

183
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,560
He's on his way up to see me.

184
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,760
The cop.

185
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,840
Guess that means I can come in.

186
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,400
Nice place.

187
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,120
Terrific view. Ahhh.

188
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,440
You didn't come by to tell me that.

189
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,720
You saw the man who was driving the car.

190
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:36,240
And you saw the man up
against the brick wall.

191
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,920
And you know it's the same man...

192
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,040
yet you didn't identify him.

193
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,040
Are you afraid of him?

194
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,360
No.

195
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,400
Are you afraid of me?

196
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,280
No.

197
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,160
I just don't like you.

198
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,040
Mm.

199
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,320
You got a reason?

200
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,960
Must be because I'm such a good cop.

201
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,760
How old are you?

202
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,440
Twenty-two.

203
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,440
I did a little checking.

204
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,720
What else did you check?

205
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,600
Well, a young girl like yourself...

206
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:42,240
you sure have been around the track
a few times, honey.

207
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,640
Led a real active life.

208
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,640
Get out.

209
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,400
No.

210
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,880
We're gonna do a little
business, you and I.

211
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,440
Look at it!

212
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,560
You sure that's not him?

213
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,960
It's not him.

214
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,240
Really?

215
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,360
Maybe you oughta be afraid of me.

216
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,440
I ran a make on you.

217
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:37,600
You're clean. No problem.

218
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,280
Of course, there was that, uh...

219
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,200
one little scrape.

220
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,120
You remember?

221
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,560
The kinda nasty one.

222
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,480
The one that got swept under the rug.

223
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,960
Now, when your memory improves, honey...

224
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,000
give me a call.

225
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,520
No guarantees.

226
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,960
- Never has been.
- He might still be down there.

227
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,520
- How'd the new girl work out?
- She did her job.

228
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,480
Who did you have pay her off?

229
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,400
I did it myself.

230
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,160
That's not like you.

231
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,960
Why am I here?

232
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,200
Some people wanna meet.

233
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:48,240
They're from downtown.
They've done a few jobs.

234
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,360
- Shooters.
- Yeah.

235
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,360
I told you I don't like guns.

236
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,200
I know. But they're looking to move up.

237
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:59,080
They got their eyes set
on something special.

238
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,640
They know my price?

239
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,760
Everybody knows your price.

240
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,720
Even paid me $300 just to get to you.

241
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,920
You did.

242
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,600
How you been?

243
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,480
I'm okay.

244
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,960
You two know each other?

245
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Couple of years ago,
we worked a two-car job.

246
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,920
You already have a driver.

247
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,560
He don't have the balls
for driving anymore.

248
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,600
You work for a piece, right?

249
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,800
$10,000 up front...

250
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,000
against 15%.

251
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,040
How do we know you're that good?

252
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,440
Get in.

253
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,280
All right!
Enough, lunatic. Enough of this shit!

254
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,400
All right, all right,
all right, all right.!

255
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,080
We believe you.! We believe you.!

256
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:44,400
Enough.! Enough.! Stop, will you?

257
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,480
I mean, for Christ's sake.!

258
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,880
For Christ's sakes!

259
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,640
Jesus!

260
00:36:39,976 --> 00:36:41,896
Easy, easy.

261
00:36:43,616 --> 00:36:47,296
Better get new plates
if you plan on taking it out again.

262
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:50,696
People might be looking for you.

263
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:58,976
You're crazy.

264
00:37:08,216 --> 00:37:10,056
We'll make you a deal.

265
00:37:13,376 --> 00:37:15,616
I don't work with people like you.

266
00:37:17,896 --> 00:37:19,816
Or him.

267
00:39:24,371 --> 00:39:27,051
This plan of yours for our friend...

268
00:39:30,891 --> 00:39:32,731
taking a little long to set up, isn't it?

269
00:39:32,811 --> 00:39:35,131
Gotta be patient, pal.

270
00:39:35,211 --> 00:39:37,691
- Ah, I see.
- Every job has its problems.

271
00:39:37,771 --> 00:39:40,011
Couldn't be you just figured it wrong?

272
00:39:41,651 --> 00:39:43,571
You know something?

273
00:39:45,691 --> 00:39:48,331
I think I'm gonna have to help you
with your education.

274
00:39:50,411 --> 00:39:52,731
This is the quiet part of the hunt.

275
00:39:52,811 --> 00:39:56,731
The trap's all set.
Cowboy's out there somewhere.

276
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:59,931
It wouldn't be any fun
if the cowboy walked into it, would it?

277
00:40:00,011 --> 00:40:03,451
That'd be no fun.
You know the best part of our job is?

278
00:40:03,531 --> 00:40:07,051
It's just a game. It's either them or us.

279
00:40:10,411 --> 00:40:13,371
- Maybe me and you.
- Oh, no way, Jose.

280
00:40:13,451 --> 00:40:15,771
You're not even in my league.

281
00:40:15,851 --> 00:40:19,291
I tell you what, though.
I'm a very generous man.

282
00:40:19,371 --> 00:40:22,691
Tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna help you be a better cop.

283
00:40:22,771 --> 00:40:24,731
You know how?

284
00:40:24,811 --> 00:40:26,971
You know what you do
first thing every morning?

285
00:40:27,051 --> 00:40:29,211
Read the sports page.

286
00:40:29,291 --> 00:40:31,131
You know why?

287
00:40:31,211 --> 00:40:33,051
Best part of the newspaper.

288
00:40:33,131 --> 00:40:36,411
Winners, losers, how it happened, score.

289
00:40:38,171 --> 00:40:41,051
Now, we've got a better game
than the one they give the players.

290
00:40:41,131 --> 00:40:44,131
They don't retire us after 10 years.

291
00:40:45,611 --> 00:40:47,451
Just one thing.

292
00:40:48,811 --> 00:40:50,971
You gotta be a player...

293
00:40:51,051 --> 00:40:53,051
a real player...

294
00:40:53,131 --> 00:40:55,211
not just filling out a position.

295
00:40:56,811 --> 00:40:59,611
I guess you figure you're a winner.

296
00:40:59,691 --> 00:41:02,251
That's it. And you're a loser.

297
00:41:02,331 --> 00:41:05,011
But I think you'd like to be a winner.

298
00:41:06,571 --> 00:41:09,731
And you're gonna show me the way, huh?

299
00:41:09,811 --> 00:41:12,891
Unless, of course,
you turn into a complete asshole first.

300
00:41:15,291 --> 00:41:17,211
Let's move.

301
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:36,091
I just wanna talk.

302
00:41:38,651 --> 00:41:43,051
We need you. You're valuable.

303
00:41:44,211 --> 00:41:46,731
I already gave you guys an answer.

304
00:41:49,691 --> 00:41:51,931
We don't like that answer.

305
00:41:53,051 --> 00:41:56,251
Be friendly. Do things our way.

306
00:41:59,931 --> 00:42:01,931
Go ahead and pull the trigger.

307
00:42:14,371 --> 00:42:18,211
You... You do anything else...

308
00:42:18,291 --> 00:42:20,211
I'll come back.

309
00:42:21,371 --> 00:42:23,771
I'll kill you.

310
00:42:37,331 --> 00:42:39,811
I'm just trying to do my job.

311
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:41,811
So am I.

312
00:42:43,731 --> 00:42:45,651
Go home.

313
00:42:47,411 --> 00:42:49,491
I just wanted to talk.

314
00:42:51,251 --> 00:42:53,171
You did.

315
00:43:18,611 --> 00:43:21,971
- Let's talk, okay?
- Go ahead.

316
00:43:22,051 --> 00:43:25,211
I'm having a very big
problem with your boy.

317
00:43:25,251 --> 00:43:27,491
He's not too thrilled in working with us.

318
00:43:29,251 --> 00:43:31,811
I can understand that.

319
00:43:31,891 --> 00:43:35,251
Look, I don't know what to do.
I'm doing the best I can, you know?

320
00:43:37,251 --> 00:43:39,971
You know what to do.
You just did it.

321
00:43:41,411 --> 00:43:45,331
You came in here
and asked me to save your ass.

322
00:43:46,331 --> 00:43:48,211
That's what I'm gonna do...

323
00:43:48,291 --> 00:43:50,211
save your ass.

324
00:44:17,851 --> 00:44:20,771
Guess I can't leave you alone, can I?

325
00:44:26,691 --> 00:44:28,891
Guess I'm just a real friendly guy.

326
00:44:30,811 --> 00:44:34,691
A friend of yours told me where I could
find you in the middle of the day.

327
00:44:34,771 --> 00:44:36,611
I don't have any friends.

328
00:44:36,691 --> 00:44:38,651
That's right.

329
00:44:38,731 --> 00:44:40,571
No friends.

330
00:44:40,651 --> 00:44:42,651
No steady job.

331
00:44:42,731 --> 00:44:44,691
No girlfriend.

332
00:44:44,771 --> 00:44:46,771
You live real cheap.

333
00:44:48,571 --> 00:44:50,811
You don't ask any questions.

334
00:44:50,851 --> 00:44:54,091
Boy, you got it down real tight.

335
00:44:54,171 --> 00:44:56,891
So tight, there's no
room for anything else.

336
00:44:59,611 --> 00:45:01,611
That's a real sad song.

337
00:45:03,211 --> 00:45:07,291
Only trouble is,
sad songs ain't selling this year.

338
00:45:18,811 --> 00:45:20,811
Maybe I'm your friend.

339
00:45:25,291 --> 00:45:27,851
Present. I brought it for you.

340
00:45:29,291 --> 00:45:32,651
Found it on the floorboard
of some Ford a cowboy boosted.

341
00:45:32,731 --> 00:45:35,491
Go ahead, take it.

342
00:45:36,571 --> 00:45:38,731
Save you the trouble of making another one.

343
00:45:50,811 --> 00:45:53,051
I really like chasing you.

344
00:45:57,571 --> 00:45:59,811
Sounds like you got a problem.

345
00:46:01,851 --> 00:46:03,651
Oh-ho.

346
00:46:03,731 --> 00:46:07,411
I'm much better at this game than you are.

347
00:46:07,451 --> 00:46:09,531
You play against me,
pal, you're gonna lose.

348
00:46:11,411 --> 00:46:13,491
You win, you make some money.

349
00:46:13,571 --> 00:46:17,051
I win, you're gonna do 15 years.

350
00:46:20,491 --> 00:46:22,411
How about it, driver?

351
00:46:50,851 --> 00:46:53,611
My price has doubled.

352
00:46:53,691 --> 00:46:56,811
Come on. Who do you think you're
dealing with? That's 30% of the take.

353
00:46:56,891 --> 00:47:00,531
That's right. Special price because
I'm working with second-raters.

354
00:47:03,651 --> 00:47:05,771
We'll make you a deal.

355
00:47:05,851 --> 00:47:08,251
I want him to say it.

356
00:47:08,331 --> 00:47:10,651
Yeah.

357
00:47:10,691 --> 00:47:13,251
One more thing. You're not coming.

358
00:47:16,371 --> 00:47:18,691
You don't give many choices, do you, pal?

359
00:47:18,771 --> 00:47:20,491
That's right.

360
00:47:25,331 --> 00:47:28,371
It's a two-man job inside.
Uh, you'll get your cut later.

361
00:47:31,411 --> 00:47:33,371
I don't like it.

362
00:47:33,451 --> 00:47:35,571
That's the whole idea.

363
00:47:41,011 --> 00:47:43,571
Boy, it's tough to like
that man, I tell you.

364
00:48:03,331 --> 00:48:06,811
We got him. He's doing the job.

365
00:48:06,891 --> 00:48:08,571
Look, I gotta tell you something.

366
00:48:08,611 --> 00:48:10,611
It's very important for you to get this.

367
00:48:10,691 --> 00:48:13,371
Hold up your end of this deal.

368
00:48:13,411 --> 00:48:17,211
'Cause if I should see any cops at all
in front of that bank, any at all...

369
00:48:17,291 --> 00:48:19,131
there's gonna be a lot
of shooting going on.

370
00:48:26,371 --> 00:48:28,731
Now listen to me!
I don't want any shooting.

371
00:48:28,811 --> 00:48:32,571
- Got that? Got it?
- Yeah, I got it.

372
00:48:34,091 --> 00:48:36,091
I just need one thing out of you...

373
00:48:36,171 --> 00:48:38,251
and that's the drop point.

374
00:48:38,331 --> 00:48:42,131
Understand?

375
00:48:43,971 --> 00:48:46,851
That way, I get my man, I get the money...

376
00:48:46,931 --> 00:48:49,811
and the money gets back
to the people it belongs to.

377
00:48:52,891 --> 00:48:55,811
Straighten up your little corduroy jacket.

378
00:48:59,051 --> 00:49:01,331
Now piss off. I'm sick of lookin' at you.

379
00:49:01,371 --> 00:49:04,491
- You really do like to lean, don'tcha?
- It's part of the job, pal.

380
00:49:04,571 --> 00:49:07,531
Yeah? It doesn't make things too easy,
lemme tell you.

381
00:49:11,691 --> 00:49:13,651
The man's afraid of heights.

382
00:49:20,931 --> 00:49:23,011
Goddamn it! You set the alarm off!

383
00:49:23,091 --> 00:49:25,491
Come on! Now move!

384
00:49:25,531 --> 00:49:27,851
Move, move, move, move, move!

385
00:49:27,931 --> 00:49:29,851
Let's go.

386
00:49:37,251 --> 00:49:39,531
- No!
- You triggered the alarm!

387
00:49:39,611 --> 00:49:42,291
You're starting to
scare the shit out of me!

388
00:50:00,531 --> 00:50:02,691
All right, let's move.

389
00:50:02,771 --> 00:50:06,371
I covered him out the back. He's okay.
Let's move, all right?

390
00:50:33,691 --> 00:50:37,691
I never thought I'd be standing around,
waiting for this cowboy to make it.

391
00:50:37,771 --> 00:50:39,691
Well, you are...

392
00:50:40,651 --> 00:50:42,891
and he will.

393
00:50:42,971 --> 00:50:45,611
You don't have any doubts, huh?

394
00:50:45,691 --> 00:50:48,251
About our desperado?

395
00:50:48,331 --> 00:50:50,251
About your badge.

396
00:50:54,571 --> 00:50:57,291
Boy. You are really an
asshole, you know that?

397
00:51:32,811 --> 00:51:35,571
Can't get over the mistake you made.

398
00:51:37,291 --> 00:51:39,251
You've been set up, you know?

399
00:51:39,291 --> 00:51:41,451
By a cop.

400
00:51:41,531 --> 00:51:44,251
That's right.

401
00:51:44,291 --> 00:51:47,411
He's waiting for you right now
at the wrong place.

402
00:51:47,451 --> 00:51:49,771
Me and my friend don't want to show up.

403
00:51:51,131 --> 00:51:54,411
You two hotshots have both been set up,
haven't you?

404
00:51:54,491 --> 00:51:57,251
You know what always amazed me about you?

405
00:51:57,331 --> 00:52:00,571
A guy with your attitude
never carries a gun.

406
00:52:01,611 --> 00:52:05,171
That's stupid. Very stupid.

407
00:55:30,971 --> 00:55:34,491
I want a room. One night, maybe two.

408
00:55:34,571 --> 00:55:36,491
Five bucks a night.

409
00:55:39,131 --> 00:55:40,971
I'm expecting someone.

410
00:55:41,051 --> 00:55:43,051
If she shows, send her right up.

411
00:55:44,971 --> 00:55:47,331
Hey, you want a TV?
It's a dollar extra.

412
00:56:33,291 --> 00:56:35,891
Get on over and keep
your eye our little lady.

413
00:56:35,971 --> 00:56:37,171
Right.

414
00:56:37,251 --> 00:56:39,571
Forget it.
I'll put an A. P. B. Out on all of them.

415
00:56:39,611 --> 00:56:42,331
No, you won't.

416
00:56:42,411 --> 00:56:44,851
What the hell are you talking about?

417
00:56:44,891 --> 00:56:47,291
It's tough doing business with lowlifes.

418
00:56:48,331 --> 00:56:50,451
They're unreliable.

419
00:56:50,491 --> 00:56:53,251
But we got a few moves left.

420
00:56:53,331 --> 00:56:56,531
Just, uh, makes the game
a little more interesting, that's all.

421
00:56:56,571 --> 00:56:58,771
Yeah, well, I've been watching your moves.

422
00:56:58,811 --> 00:57:01,331
I gotta tell you, I'm
not all that impressed.

423
00:57:01,371 --> 00:57:03,291
No shit?

424
00:57:03,371 --> 00:57:05,651
No shit.

425
00:57:05,691 --> 00:57:08,851
We got a mutiny with this man here!

426
00:57:08,891 --> 00:57:10,971
- Shit.
- Wait a second.

427
00:57:12,411 --> 00:57:17,171
Now, you're still on my team,
and I am your manager.

428
00:57:17,211 --> 00:57:20,411
You do exactly what I
tell you to do, got it?

429
00:57:21,691 --> 00:57:23,611
Suit yourself.

430
00:57:23,691 --> 00:57:25,651
Now you're talking.

431
00:57:39,931 --> 00:57:41,771
What about the other two?

432
00:57:41,851 --> 00:57:43,891
I haven't seen them.

433
00:57:45,971 --> 00:57:48,331
You better stay out of sight for a while.

434
00:57:48,411 --> 00:57:50,931
There's a cop trying to put this one on me.

435
00:57:51,011 --> 00:57:54,411
The money's hot. I wanna trade it in.

436
00:57:54,491 --> 00:57:56,731
The exchange rate's 4-to-1 at best.

437
00:57:56,811 --> 00:58:01,011
I'll take it. The train station, 9:00.

438
00:58:01,051 --> 00:58:03,771
That sandwich counter by the lockers.

439
00:58:03,811 --> 00:58:05,691
I don't like it.

440
00:58:05,731 --> 00:58:07,851
I didn't think you would.

441
00:58:14,131 --> 00:58:15,971
I'll set it up...

442
00:58:17,171 --> 00:58:19,251
but they won't do it if you're there.

443
00:58:19,331 --> 00:58:22,171
Tonight you'll be hotter than the cash.

444
00:58:22,211 --> 00:58:24,371
I'll get somebody.

445
00:58:26,171 --> 00:58:28,531
Keep your eye out for those other two.

446
00:58:30,051 --> 00:58:32,211
They'll know I have their money.

447
00:58:32,251 --> 00:58:36,291
I told you, I'm not
gonna get killed for you.

448
00:59:00,531 --> 00:59:02,451
Room 3004.

449
00:59:38,051 --> 00:59:40,571
I don't know where he is.
I haven't seen him.

450
00:59:50,371 --> 00:59:53,171
Just tell me what you want.

451
00:59:56,251 --> 00:59:59,571
I just set things up.

452
01:00:01,091 --> 01:00:03,171
It's his business what happens after that.

453
01:00:06,051 --> 01:00:08,891
If it was jewelry or bonds,
he might come to me.

454
01:00:08,931 --> 01:00:10,851
But with cash, he doesn't need me.

455
01:00:17,571 --> 01:00:20,411
I won't see him till the next one.

456
01:00:56,251 --> 01:00:58,131
In a hotel downtown.

457
01:00:59,771 --> 01:01:01,731
The Doran.

458
01:01:05,571 --> 01:01:08,891
The money's in a locker
at the train station.

459
01:01:08,931 --> 01:01:11,771
9:00 he's trading for smaller bills.

460
01:01:14,491 --> 01:01:16,411
That's all.

461
01:01:26,331 --> 01:01:28,291
I warned him.

462
01:01:30,771 --> 01:01:33,131
I told him I wouldn't get killed for him.

463
01:01:36,731 --> 01:01:38,651
Sure.

464
01:02:32,891 --> 01:02:34,971
You don't have to play.
If everything goes all right...

465
01:02:35,051 --> 01:02:37,051
I'll have your money by tomorrow morning.

466
01:02:42,011 --> 01:02:44,011
I'll see it through.

467
01:02:46,931 --> 01:02:49,051
I think you're crazy.

468
01:02:50,331 --> 01:02:53,731
Put the key in a safe-deposit box
for six months...

469
01:02:53,811 --> 01:02:55,771
then go get the money.

470
01:02:57,051 --> 01:02:59,411
I'm on a streak. I'm gonna play it out.

471
01:02:59,451 --> 01:03:01,371
I'm gonna get it tonight.

472
01:03:01,451 --> 01:03:03,891
I know all about streaks.

473
01:03:03,931 --> 01:03:06,611
Every player says,
"This time is different."

474
01:03:09,771 --> 01:03:12,211
Maybe we are alike.

475
01:03:12,251 --> 01:03:13,891
No.

476
01:03:13,971 --> 01:03:16,771
When I lose, I just go broke.

477
01:03:16,851 --> 01:03:18,811
You go to jail.

478
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:25,331
If it wasn't for that cop,
I'd tell you to go ahead.

479
01:03:26,851 --> 01:03:29,171
He's the reason I've got the rush on.

480
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:34,491
You don't care about the money.

481
01:03:34,571 --> 01:03:36,651
Might even send it to him.

482
01:03:36,731 --> 01:03:38,731
Sucker's game.

483
01:03:44,771 --> 01:03:47,291
You think... maybe...

484
01:03:48,811 --> 01:03:50,931
you could wait for a while?

485
01:04:36,291 --> 01:04:37,811
Coffee.

486
01:05:02,811 --> 01:05:04,771
I'll be right back for my change.

487
01:05:32,251 --> 01:05:35,211
Ah, he's about 27, 28 years old.
He's a punk.

488
01:05:46,331 --> 01:05:49,531
Looks like theyjust switched keys.

489
01:05:49,571 --> 01:05:52,171
Yeah. He's going back
to the lockers right now.

490
01:05:52,251 --> 01:05:54,731
He's wearing one of those cowboy suits.

491
01:05:54,811 --> 01:05:56,971
He's got a beard... a real sleaze-O.

492
01:05:57,051 --> 01:05:59,371
He's exchanging the bag.

493
01:05:59,451 --> 01:06:01,291
Black attaché case.

494
01:06:01,371 --> 01:06:03,531
Yeah, dirty money for clean.

495
01:06:03,611 --> 01:06:05,931
Yeah. He's moving...
headed for the platform.

496
01:06:06,011 --> 01:06:09,611
He's coming your way.
Right. I'll stick with him.

497
01:06:46,531 --> 01:06:48,411
Shit!

498
01:07:16,971 --> 01:07:19,931
- Look at your bag, pal? - All right.
There's just some papers in it.

499
01:07:20,011 --> 01:07:22,171
We'll see.

500
01:07:29,091 --> 01:07:31,851
- How about you then?
- Yeah. Go ahead. Take a look.

501
01:08:36,611 --> 01:08:38,491
- Yeah?
- Police.

502
01:08:38,531 --> 01:08:40,931
- We're checking all the luggage.
- Just a minute.

503
01:08:41,011 --> 01:08:42,931
Not just a minute. Now!

504
01:09:07,611 --> 01:09:10,571
Hey. What the hell are you trying to...

505
01:09:10,651 --> 01:09:12,851
- Is that yours?
- It's not mine.

506
01:09:12,891 --> 01:09:14,811
Yours?

507
01:09:16,211 --> 01:09:18,051
- Is that yours?
- Look, man, I'm cool.

508
01:09:18,131 --> 01:09:19,971
- Is it yours?
- No!

509
01:09:20,051 --> 01:09:21,891
- Do you have one?
- Yeah. I gotta bag. It's up here.

510
01:09:21,971 --> 01:09:24,531
- Where? Where?
- It's gone!

511
01:09:24,611 --> 01:09:26,971
- Was it light brown?
- Yeah, that's right, man.

512
01:10:21,891 --> 01:10:24,411
You okay, lady?

513
01:10:40,851 --> 01:10:44,571
A man took my purse. He's got the key.

514
01:10:44,611 --> 01:10:47,451
He ran to the other side of the station.

515
01:11:08,491 --> 01:11:10,931
There!

516
01:11:12,491 --> 01:11:14,651
All right. We got trouble. Go!

517
01:11:14,731 --> 01:11:16,571
Go, go!

518
01:19:22,971 --> 01:19:24,891
Let's get out of here!

519
01:19:50,531 --> 01:19:52,651
- Look out! Look out!
- Aaah!

520
01:21:08,651 --> 01:21:11,251
Give up.

521
01:21:39,611 --> 01:21:41,651
I just did the driving.

522
01:21:41,691 --> 01:21:43,731
I ain't got no part in anything else.

523
01:22:19,931 --> 01:22:21,811
Go home.

524
01:23:08,171 --> 01:23:12,211
- You okay?
- Yeah.

525
01:23:12,291 --> 01:23:14,571
I'll see you in a couple of minutes.

526
01:24:22,211 --> 01:24:24,171
Gotcha.

527
01:24:36,491 --> 01:24:38,411
What happened?

528
01:24:39,371 --> 01:24:42,371
Looks like we both got swindled.

529
01:24:42,451 --> 01:24:44,611
Looks like we both got ripped off...

530
