[MUSIC - BRAD HAYES, "SAY THOSE
 THINGS"]

2
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:28,728
(SINGING) What you told
me not to do long ago.

3
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:32,399
If you love me,
better tell me so.

4
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:36,536
Say those things on your mind.

5
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,676
What's you're saying
is in between.

6
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,547
I'd wish you tell me
just what you mean.

7
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,451
You got to say those
things on your mind.

8
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:57,590
It's not the truth.

9
00:00:57,624 --> 00:01:01,361
But it's not a lie when
you can't say the things

10
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:04,164
that you feel inside.

11
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:06,633
Feel like you're walking
on a moving track.

12
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:10,370
You take one step forward,
and one step back.

13
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:19,612
What you see is
not what you get.

14
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:21,848
What's underneath this
thing, come out yet.

15
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:27,253
You got to say those
things on your mind.

16
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:32,292
Go on and say those things.

17
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:38,364
JANE DOE: So Jimmy, are
you afraid of the dark?

18
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:45,505
So I guess we--
we started then.

19
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:47,774
JANE DOE: Uh-huh.

20
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:49,776
Are you afraid of the dark?

21
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:51,611
[laughs nervously]

22
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:54,814
And-- and that's
your first question?

23
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:57,217
JANE DOE: Uh-huh.

24
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,186
How about a first answer?

25
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,956
Well, yeah.

26
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:05,959
I guess in this situation I--

27
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:09,229
I am a little uncomfortable.

28
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:11,531
JANE DOE: Why?

29
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:15,301
Because I can't see you.

30
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:16,970
JANE DOE: Well, I
can't see you either.

31
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:18,304
Yeah.

32
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:19,739
But you probably
saw me coming in.

33
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:21,374
JANE DOE: Mm.
Yeah.

34
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:22,509
You're right, I did.

35
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:25,345
So that puts me
at a disadvantage.

36
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:27,680
JANE DOE: A disadvantage.

37
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:29,215
And you don't like that.

38
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:29,849
Do you?

39
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:37,891
Well, in this situation
I'm not too sure.

40
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:40,260
JANE DOE: What's the difference?

41
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:41,461
You can't see me.

42
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:42,495
I can't see you.

43
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:43,730
Yeah.

44
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:47,367
But I have no idea
what you look like.

45
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,770
JANE DOE: Why do you want to
know what I look like, Jimmy?

46
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:52,739
What do you mean?

47
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:56,442
JANE DOE: I mean, does it
matter what I look like?

48
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:00,513
What are you getting at?

49
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:02,515
JANE DOE: Oh, nothing.

50
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:04,584
Just tell me what difference
it makes what I look like.

51
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:08,721
Well, it doesn't
make any difference.

52
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:12,025
I just thought it would be nice
to see a face with the voice.

53
00:03:12,058 --> 00:03:12,892
That's all.

54
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:24,771
Jesus.

55
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:26,406
What the hell is this.

56
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:29,442
JANE DOE: You wanted lights,
well, you got lights.

57
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:30,510
Is this a joke?

58
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:31,911
JANE DOE: Afraid not.

59
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:34,547
This is the way it's going
to be for the duration.

60
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:35,848
Is this really necessary?

61
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,418
JANE DOE: Oh, it's all
part of the process.

62
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:40,286
Oh, well, it's very good.

63
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,588
A good, dramatic effect.

64
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:42,589
The Nazi thing.

65
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:43,623
I like it.

66
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:44,857
JANE DOE: You'll get used to it.

67
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,392
Right.

68
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:47,660
JANE DOE: You got to do
something for me, Jimmy.

69
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:48,795
[sighs]

70
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:50,496
What's that?

71
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:51,798
JANE DOE: You have to answer
the questions right away.

72
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:52,732
I don't want you to think.

73
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:53,766
Well, I have to.

74
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,535
My parents made me promise.

75
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,437
JANE DOE: If you think,
you'll defend yourself.

76
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,305
And if you defend
yourself, you'll lie.

77
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:00,873
That's just the way you are.

78
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,009
You don't know
anything about me!

79
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:04,777
JANE DOE: I meant men.

80
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:07,614
Oh.

81
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:09,782
What's your name?

82
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:11,985
JANE DOE: That's not important.

83
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:13,786
You're not going to tell me?
JANE DOE: Mm.

84
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,021
No.
- Ever?

85
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:16,456
JANE DOE: No.

86
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:17,724
Why?

87
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,792
JANE DOE: Well, we
never give our names.

88
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:22,395
Things work better that way.

89
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:23,429
Why?

90
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:24,063
JANE DOE: Don't worry about it.

91
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,534
Well, there's another one.

92
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:30,370
JANE DOE: What?

93
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:31,771
Disadvantage.

94
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:32,739
No face.

95
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:33,906
No name.

96
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,909
This is like a blind
date from hell.

97
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:41,581
JANE DOE: The last thing
this is, Jimmy, is a date.

98
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,449
Don't forget it.

99
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:44,884
I promise.

100
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:48,454
JANE DOE: We're here to
find out about you, not me.

101
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:51,090
When I ask you a question, you
answer as quickly as possible.

102
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:51,991
Don't think.

103
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:53,092
Don't defend.

104
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,661
Just answer.

105
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:57,397
If you want to ask a
question about me, don't.

106
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,698
Don't even think about me.

107
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:01,401
It's none of your business.

108
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:02,802
Is that clear?

109
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:04,103
Yes.

110
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,872
JANE DOE: We're not
here to have fun, Jimmy.

111
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:07,106
This is serious.

112
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,508
You agreed to take
part no matter

113
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:09,976
what questions are asked.

114
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:12,045
You've committed to
answering them honestly.

115
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:15,682
Oh, and don't hold back
just because I'm a woman.

116
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:18,818
Don't tell me what you
think I want to hear.

117
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:20,553
Just answer.

118
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:22,655
I think I can handle that.

119
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,857
JANE DOE: Good.

120
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:29,395
So Jimmy, let's
talk about women.

121
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:30,063
OK.

122
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:35,835
Let's talk about women.

123
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:37,103
SEAN: No.
No.

124
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:38,404
No way.

125
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:39,472
You were in there for two hours?

126
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:40,139
Yeah.

127
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:45,078
Well, how long were
you guys in for?

128
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:46,713
I was in for
about a half hour.

129
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:48,514
Genius over there lasted
about five minutes.

130
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:49,415
Yeah.

131
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:50,750
Five minutes too long.

132
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:51,851
I'm sorry I even let you
guys talk me into it.

133
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:53,019
Gee, sorry.

134
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:54,487
I thought you might
learn something.

135
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,755
Are you serious?

136
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:57,857
I wasn't in there a
minute before this woman

137
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:00,059
started bitching at me.

138
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:01,094
She called me a rapist.

139
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:02,462
Yeah.

140
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,464
Mine called all men
fascist rapists.

141
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:05,565
Is that what yours said?
- Yeah.

142
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:06,866
That's what she said.

143
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:09,435
Mine also said that
all men are pigs, liars.

144
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:11,504
All they want is
sex, and that they'll

145
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:12,972
say or do anything to get it.
- Yeah.

146
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:14,073
Yeah.
That's what I got.

147
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:15,641
What a crock of shit.
- No.

148
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:16,609
It's the absolute truth.

149
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:17,543
Oh, Christ.

150
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:18,478
Here we go.

151
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:19,746
You are a lost cause.

152
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:20,613
So I'm not even going
to argue with you.

153
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:21,647
But Jimmy, come on.

154
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:22,548
You can't disagree with that.

155
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:23,483
Look, Tim, I don't--

156
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:24,684
Oh, come on.

157
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,085
When are you guys
going to wake up?

158
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:28,721
The entire industrial
military complex is

159
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:30,490
based on men's pursuit of sex.

160
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:32,558
The sooner we admit it, the
sooner we can change it.

161
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:33,993
You guys keep following
your dicks around,

162
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:34,994
we're never going
to get anywhere.

163
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:36,129
- I don't follow--
- Whoa.

164
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:37,797
Whoa.
Let me get this straight.

165
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,132
Are you saying that you never
follow your dick around?

166
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:40,199
Never.

167
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,501
Bullshit.

168
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:42,635
Unlike you, son,
I have control.

169
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:43,569
Oh-ho.

170
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:44,470
Spare me.

171
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:45,238
Control.

172
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:46,873
You sit down to piss?

173
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,241
Up yours.

174
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:49,842
So you going back?

175
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:51,043
Nope.

176
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,612
After talking for
about a half hour

177
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:53,913
she said she didn't
think I should come back.

178
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:55,581
Why not?

179
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:56,682
She didn't think it would
be insightful, because she

180
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:58,117
said I'm so well-adjusted.

181
00:06:58,151 --> 00:06:59,252
Well-adjusted?
You?

182
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:00,219
Eat your heart out.

183
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,854
Are you going back, Sean?

184
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:04,190
Not in a million years!

185
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:06,626
Well, I think I'm
going to go back.

186
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:07,660
What?

187
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:09,195
- Right on, Jim.
- Hey, Jim.

188
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:10,129
Come on.

189
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:11,764
Him I understand.

190
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:12,665
But not you.

191
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:13,966
No.

192
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,201
She said some shit I
really don't agree with.

193
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:16,869
Don't bother.

194
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:19,972
They're just a bunch of
sexually repressed feminists.

195
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:21,674
All they want to do
is cut your nuts off.

196
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:22,608
Maybe.

197
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:27,580
But I'm going back.

198
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:30,016
Jim, yeah.
You, maybe.

199
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:31,250
But Sean?

200
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,886
I cannot believe
Sean took part in any

201
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,122
experiment conducted by the
women's studies department.

202
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:37,657
Yeah.

203
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,559
Well, we had to drag him
kicking and screaming.

204
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:40,293
[chuckles]

205
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:41,761
Oh, big surprise.

206
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:42,695
Yeah.

207
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:43,863
I don't know.

208
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:46,666
The woman I had
was tough as nails.

209
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:47,934
I mean, I lasted two hours.

210
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,035
But man, she was brutal.
- Why?

211
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:50,837
What'd she say?

212
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,105
JIMMY (ON PHONE): Oh, you know,
the whole men are pigs stick.

213
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,774
Yeah.

214
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:57,043
The same basic sermon I
usually I get on first dates.

215
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:58,611
Women say that to
you on first dates?

216
00:07:58,644 --> 00:07:59,645
Yep.

217
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:01,047
MIMI (ON PHONE): Well, my god.

218
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,615
What do you do to make
them attack you like that?

219
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:03,549
No.

220
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,117
It's not about me.

221
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,653
It's always about their last
boyfriend, or a date they had.

222
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:08,921
You know, it's just a warning.

223
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:10,323
If you're a pig, they
don't want to have

224
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:11,858
anything to do with you.

225
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:13,559
Well, what woman would
ever think you're a pig.

226
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:15,995
Hey, I'm as much of
a pig as the next guy.

227
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:17,330
I've just learned to fake it.

228
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:19,765
MIMI (ON PHONE): Don't
even joke like that.

229
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:20,733
What are you eating?

230
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:21,868
JIMMY (ON PHONE): Cereal.

231
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:23,135
For dinner?

232
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,704
JIMMY (ON PHONE):
Hey, [inaudible]..

233
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:25,605
Oh, god.

234
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:26,572
You're so pathetic.

235
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:27,306
JIMMY (ON PHONE): Thanks.

236
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,609
So how's the love life?

237
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:30,843
MIMI (ON PHONE): Dismal.

238
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:32,745
I haven't had sex
in so long I can't

239
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:34,614
remember what a man feels like.

240
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:39,118
Well, you know, if things
are that bad, we could always--

241
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:42,255
MIMI (ON PHONE): You know,
Jimmy, what I really want--

242
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:43,623
What?

243
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:44,657
Romance.

244
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,759
There's no romance in my life.

245
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:50,029
I have never really
had a wild romance.

246
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:51,664
I could be romantic.

247
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,633
A passionate love affair.

248
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,034
I could be passionate.

249
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:57,136
MIMI (ON PHONE): You
know, it's more than want.

250
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:59,171
It's like, I've come
to the point in my life

251
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,973
where I need romance.

252
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:03,876
I mean, how many relationships
have I been through since we've

253
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:04,944
known each other?
Like what?

254
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:05,878
At least--

255
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:06,879
Five.

256
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:08,214
MIMI (ON PHONE): Right.

257
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:11,617
And not one of them was
romantic or passionate.

258
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:15,922
There has got to be some guy
out there who's romantic.

259
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:16,856
Oh, god.

260
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,091
It is so depressing.

261
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:24,230
Mimi, do you think
all men are rapists?

262
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:25,831
What?

263
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:26,832
JIMMY (ON PHONE): Do you
think all men are rapists?

264
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:27,800
Well, no.

265
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:28,901
Where did that come from?

266
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:30,836
Well, the woman
interviewing me

267
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,172
today said that all
men are rapists.

268
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:34,073
Oh, god.

269
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:35,875
Tell her to get a life.

270
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:39,712
She also said that all men are
liars and that everything we do

271
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:40,646
is for sex.

272
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,248
Can you believe that?

273
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:44,183
Well, I have to agree
with her on that one.

274
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:46,852
Oh, so you think I'm a
liar and that everything I do

275
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:48,721
is for sex.
- Oh, no.

276
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:49,689
But you're different.

277
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:50,423
JIMMY (ON PHONE): I am.

278
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:52,325
How?

279
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:53,893
Oh, I don't know.

280
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,962
You're just not like
a lot of other guys.

281
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:57,697
Not like other guys?

282
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:58,731
MIMI (ON PHONE): Well, no.

283
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,399
I mean, you think about things.

284
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,402
I've never seen you
intentionally hurt anyone.

285
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,171
You're a nice guy.

286
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:09,942
But being a nice
guy, I'm still a liar.

287
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:11,944
And I'm still motivated by sex?

288
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:12,845
Well.

289
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:14,046
(GIGGLES)

290
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,682
And women aren't
motivated by sex.

291
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:18,217
And, of course, they never lie.

292
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,286
Well, it is
different for women.

293
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:23,456
So if sex isn't your
primary motivation, what is?

294
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:25,992
Oh, it's--

295
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:27,326
[sighs]

296
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:47,747
Hi.

297
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,415
My name is James Rovinski.

298
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:52,118
And I will be teaching this
course for the winter semester.

299
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:55,354
I'm too young to be
called professor,

300
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:58,157
too rude to be called James.

301
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,359
So if any of you have
anything to ask me,

302
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:02,428
please just call me Jimmy.

303
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:04,930
And just in case any of
you are in the wrong class,

304
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:07,967
this is Psychology
101, every college's

305
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,235
number one blow off course.

306
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:10,503
[laughter]

307
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:11,737
OK.

308
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:13,739
One, two, three, four, five--

309
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:17,877
10, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.
OK.

310
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:18,878
Good.

311
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,414
Let's get started, shall we.

312
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:22,348
20.

313
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:26,419
Seven guys and 13 women.

314
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:30,356
13 young, nubile women.

315
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:31,490
Give me strength, god.

316
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,963
[knocking]

317
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:44,403
Can I take this off now?

318
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:45,271
JANE DOE: Hold on.

319
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:52,812
OK.

320
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:00,920
You know, Jane.

321
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:02,054
When a woman hits--

322
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:03,789
JANE DOE: You just
called me, Jane.

323
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:05,524
Yeah.

324
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,193
Jane Doe.

325
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:10,396
That's what they call an
unidentified woman at a morgue.

326
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:11,363
JANE DOE: Don't call me that.

327
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,565
That's sick.

328
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:14,100
Are you going to
tell me your name?

329
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:15,901
JANE DOE: No.

330
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:21,974
As I was saying, Jane, when a
woman hits 25, something snaps.

331
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:24,810
I mean, when she's 24
everything is fine.

332
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:27,313
Then she turns 25, and
she looks in the mirror,

333
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:28,514
and she sees a hag.

334
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:30,950
And suddenly she freaks out.

335
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:34,019
And it's a mad race to get
married before everything sags.

336
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:36,889
I mean, how do you
deal with that?

337
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,591
JANE DOE: What's the problem?

338
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:40,192
You're a big boy.

339
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:41,293
You take it or you leave it.

340
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:42,995
Yeah.

341
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:44,563
But nobody needs that kind
of pressure on a first date.

342
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,465
JANE DOE: Oh.
What?

343
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:49,368
You're telling me women want to
marry you after the first date?

344
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:50,402
JIMMY: No.

345
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:53,038
I'm saying that they size me up.

346
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:55,841
And if I happen to meet
their particular marriage

347
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,510
requirements, the
rest of the date's

348
00:12:57,543 --> 00:13:00,045
going to be fairly predictable.

349
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,046
JANE DOE: Oh.

350
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,215
Please, Jimmy, enlighten me.

351
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:04,917
OK, fine.

352
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,386
In my experience
the average date

353
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:10,156
goes through three stages,
the past relationship

354
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:15,194
stage, the future relationship
stage, and the underwear stage.

355
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:16,562
JANE DOE: The underwear stage?

356
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:18,030
Yeah.

357
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:20,933
It's a little theory
I've been working on.

358
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,469
It starts with the past
relationship stage.

359
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:26,472
After you've gotten past all
the mandatory small talk,

360
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:28,641
you start to talk about
your past relationships,

361
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:30,042
good or bad.

362
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:32,545
Now, this is the
most dangerous stage.

363
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:35,447
Because a serious
fuckup here can

364
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,417
sink you regardless of your
score in the other two stages.

365
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,252
JANE DOE: Your score?

366
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:41,187
Yes.

367
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,354
Your score.

368
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:43,622
And don't you
believe for a second

369
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,090
that she isn't keeping track.

370
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:48,427
Basically, conversation
here is just a cover

371
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,062
to find out what
you're like, you

372
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:52,398
know, who you've slept
with, how many you've slept

373
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:53,666
with, et cetera, et cetera.

374
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:55,668
So assuming that you've
scored well here,

375
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:57,570
you move on to the next stage.

376
00:13:57,603 --> 00:13:59,405
JANE DOE: The future
relationship stage.

377
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:01,173
JIMMY: Right.

378
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:05,578
You start talking about the
kind of relationships you want,

379
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:07,580
what your hopes
are for the future.

380
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:09,281
Pretty straightforward stuff.

381
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:10,583
But uh, uh, uh, uh.

382
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:12,284
Don't you believe it.

383
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:15,688
It is all a cover to find
out one all important thing.

384
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:20,025
Is the victim ready to commit?

385
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:22,228
JANE DOE: You're so
full of shit, Rovinski.

386
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:24,396
You obviously don't date.

387
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,965
JANE DOE: None of
your damn business.

388
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:26,432
Ha.
Ha.

389
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:28,234
Right.

390
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:30,135
You see, the funny thing is, is
that even if you make it pretty

391
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:33,038
clear that you're
not ready to commit,

392
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:35,374
if you've done well in
the first two stages,

393
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:38,077
you'll usually make
it to the third stage.

394
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,445
JANE DOE: Oh, the
underwear stage.

395
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:40,613
Mhm.

396
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:42,348
The underwear stage.

397
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:45,050
If you make it this far, oh-ho,
you have passed the test.

398
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:46,318
You fit the bill.

399
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:49,088
And it is time to
get down to business.

400
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:51,557
It's time to start baiting you.

401
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,691
JANE DOE: Baiting you?

402
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,727
JIMMY: Mercilessly.

403
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,230
She'll start to talk
about her underwear.

404
00:14:58,264 --> 00:14:59,265
JANE DOE: I'm not hearing this.

405
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:00,199
Mhm.

406
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,200
Lingerie.

407
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,569
Usually almost always black.

408
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:05,638
JANE DOE: I am really
not hearing this.

409
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:09,108
Somehow she will manage
to slip it in that she found

410
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:11,677
the greatest little lingerie
boutique last weekend,

411
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:15,080
you know, even though
people don't see it.

412
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:18,417
It's really important to wear
sexy underwear because it makes

413
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:21,287
them feel so blah, blah, blah.

414
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,488
JANE DOE: Women don't do that.

415
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:24,056
I swear to God.

416
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,058
And if it's not underwear,
it's something else

417
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,693
usually not so subtle.
JANE DOE: What?

418
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:28,727
You've had women do that?

419
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:29,995
Oh, yeah.

420
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:32,464
But here is the tough part.

421
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:34,300
Suppose after the
first two stages,

422
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,434
the guy isn't interested.

423
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:37,002
JANE DOE: So?

424
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:38,504
JIMMY: So she starts
talking about her panties,

425
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:40,539
and what do you think's
going to happen?

426
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:42,174
JANE DOE: What?

427
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:44,343
JIMMY: The poor sap is
going to have to reconsider,

428
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:46,045
even though she might
have totally blown it.

429
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:47,746
JANE DOE: You know, that's
why men are so pathetic.

430
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,214
I mean, all you ever
think about is sex.

431
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:51,116
JIMMY: Yeah.
But don't you see.

432
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,685
The guy didn't even
bring sex into it.

433
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:54,486
She did.

434
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,221
JANE DOE: She was just talking
about her god damn underwear.

435
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:58,090
But she was
baiting him with it.

436
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,491
She is trying to take
advantage of him.

437
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:00,526
JANE DOE: What?

438
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,194
You can't walk away from that?

439
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:04,163
A woman mentions her underwear
and you lose control?

440
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:05,597
Well, a lot of
guys won't walk away.

441
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,399
They'll sleep with
her, if they can.

442
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:10,269
And because they weren't really
interested in the first place,

443
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:13,072
they'll avoid her
calls, or leave town,

444
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:14,473
or do any of the
other stupid things

445
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:16,442
that guys do to make women
think they're assholes.

446
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:19,812
JANE DOE: But don't you
see how sad you are?

447
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:21,146
JIMMY: No.

448
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,382
Frankly, in that
situation, I think

449
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:24,650
both people are pretty sad.

450
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:27,753
Because here is the
point, my dear Jane.

451
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:30,222
By the end of a date
like that, not only do I

452
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:31,623
feel like a total slab of meat.

453
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,826
But my intelligence
has been insulted.

454
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:35,394
I've lost all respect
for the woman.

455
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:37,496
And worst of all,
I'm horny as hell.

456
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:39,298
JANE DOE: Has it
ever occurred to you

457
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,133
that maybe she's
not the least bit

458
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,401
interested in a relationship.

459
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:46,305
I mean, maybe she just
wants to fuck you.

460
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,840
Have you thought of that?

461
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:49,508
Yeah.

462
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:52,845
But as a man, I'm a real
macho, arrogant, son of a bitch

463
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:55,180
if I think that she just
wants to fuck me, right?

464
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:56,181
JANE DOE: Mm.

465
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:57,716
JIMMY: Right.

466
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,319
So let's just say with what
I am allowed to be thinking,

467
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:01,720
I'm giving her the
benefit of the doubt.

468
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:05,691
JANE DOE: Excuse me.

469
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:17,569
May I?

470
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:20,572
Be my guest.

471
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:22,207
Is something wrong?

472
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:23,509
[lighter]

473
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:27,780
[blows smoke]

474
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:33,285
It's kind of scary.

475
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:34,853
I've got one that's
been thinking.

476
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,321
[laughs]

477
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,862
Actually, women never talk
to me about their underwear.

478
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,531
How'd she react?

479
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:46,632
Well, she flipped.

480
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:48,233
Big wonder.

481
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:50,636
I thought you quit smoking.

482
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:52,504
I did.
Yesterday.

483
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:54,606
Oh.

484
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,775
So what else did
you talk about?

485
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:58,310
Women again.

486
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:02,514
Or, you know, at least
what I think about them.

487
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:03,882
I told her about Mimi.

488
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:04,817
You did?

489
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,385
Yeah.

490
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,187
Boy, you're really baring
your soul to this woman.

491
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,721
JIMMY: Yeah.

492
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,156
Well, I get the feeling she's
pretty negative about men.

493
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,191
So.
What else is new?

494
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:13,692
Right.

495
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:14,359
So I wanted to make sure she
knew I had female friends.

496
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:15,260
Aha.

497
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:16,395
Oh.

498
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,796
So you didn't tell
her everything.

499
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,231
What do you mean?

500
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,499
You only told her
Mimi's your friend.

501
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:21,800
She is only my friend.

502
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,235
So you didn't tell
her you're in love

503
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:24,903
with Mimi, your female friend.

504
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,638
I am not in love with Mimi.

505
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:30,742
I simply feel a sometimes
overwhelming potential

506
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:31,944
to be in love with Mimi.

507
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:34,179
A sometimes
overwhelming potential?

508
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:35,581
My god.

509
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,416
You've even defined your
way out of being in love.

510
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,284
It's no wonder you have
problems with commitment.

511
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:40,219
Commitment?

512
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:40,919
Jesus.

513
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,287
What about you?

514
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:43,689
I'm committed.

515
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:45,324
I just haven't found
anybody who'll commit to me.

516
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:46,258
I'm committed.

517
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,559
Yeah.

518
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:48,927
Well, I'm not having
such hot luck myself.

519
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,195
Bullshit.

520
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:51,396
You've had your chances.
- Yeah.

521
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,764
But I don't know
what's wrong with me.

522
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:53,866
I mean, I go out on
three dates with a woman.

523
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:55,434
And then I bail.

524
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:56,768
And I don't even know why.

525
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,872
Because you're
a simpering idiot.

526
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:03,442
I'm starting to think
maybe I'm homosexual.

527
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:04,643
- What?
- No.

528
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:05,944
I'm serious.

529
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,346
I was walking down the
street the other day

530
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:08,981
right behind this
long haired babe.

531
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:10,582
Right?
- Mhm.

532
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:11,917
I mean, she was really
good looking from behind.

533
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,685
So, you know, I
pick up the pace.

534
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:14,820
And I get up to her.

535
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:17,222
And I look in her face.

536
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:17,923
It was a guy.

537
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:19,925
[laughs]

538
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:23,495
And this qualifies you as
having homosexual tendencies?

539
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:25,564
JIMMY: Well, it got
me worrying about it.

540
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:26,665
Now I'm sure.

541
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:28,367
You are an idiot.
Homosexual.

542
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,601
JIMMY: What?

543
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:30,802
How did you ever
get a job teaching?

544
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,504
You never think about it?

545
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:34,406
I, for one, am perfectly
comfortable with my manhood.

546
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:35,307
OK.

547
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,575
Well, forget about sex.

548
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:38,544
I mean, you have never
looked at some guy

549
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:40,913
and found him attractive,
even in some remote way?

550
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:42,981
Wouldn't know an attractive
guy if he ran me over.

551
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:43,916
JIMMY: Yeah.

552
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:45,684
Right.

553
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:46,985
Unless he just picked up the
woman you were trying to meet.

554
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,520
TIM: Nope.

555
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:50,589
I just put that down to
poor taste on her part.

556
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:51,623
Sorry, Jim.

557
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:52,824
No confused thoughts up here.

558
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,359
SEAN: Drinky-poos anybody?

559
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:55,627
On me.
- Yeah.

560
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:57,029
I'm in.

561
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:58,664
Jimmy here is working his
way out of the closet.

562
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,500
And I'd rather not be alone
with him while he does.

563
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:02,367
I'll just change my shirt.

564
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:14,713
[phone ringing]

565
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:20,452
[beep]

566
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:21,453
Hello?

567
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:22,955
PAULA (ON PHONE): Hi there.

568
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:25,657
JIMMY (ON PHONE): Paula, do
you know what time it is?

569
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:26,592
Mhm.

570
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:27,626
Do you?

571
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:28,560
JIMMY (ON PHONE): No, actually.

572
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:29,761
What time is it?

573
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:30,829
It's late.

574
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:32,531
Past midnight.

575
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:33,565
JIMMY (ON PHONE): Well, you
shouldn't call this late.

576
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:34,866
People are sleeping.

577
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,702
It's Friday night.
You guys are all single.

578
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,936
Why aren't you out somewhere?

579
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,072
Well, Sean and Tim
are out somewhere.

580
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:41,440
But I was sleeping.

581
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:42,641
PAULA (ON PHONE):
Well, you don't

582
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:44,543
sound like you were sleeping.

583
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,478
Well, I was about
to be sleeping.

584
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:47,479
Good.

585
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:48,880
Then I called just in time.

586
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,550
JIMMY (ON PHONE): You
sound bored, Paula.

587
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,719
I'm never bored, James dear.

588
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,554
JIMMY (ON PHONE): What
do you want, Paula?

589
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:56,455
My.

590
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:57,456
You're in a bad mood.

591
00:20:57,489 --> 00:20:58,490
My mother was right.

592
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:00,525
Never call a man after 11:00 PM.

593
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:01,727
Let me guess.

594
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,828
He's out of town.

595
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:03,762
No.

596
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:05,397
He's not out of town.

597
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,666
Gregory doesn't feel
threatened by my ex boyfriends.

598
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:10,402
I can do whatever I
want whenever I want.

599
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:11,803
Well, I'm so happy for you.

600
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:12,938
What do you want, Paula?

601
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:14,339
[sighs]

602
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:15,941
Your 30th birthday
is coming up.

603
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:18,443
And I was wondering if I could
take you out to dinner tomorrow

604
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:19,911
night to celebrate.
PAULA (ON PHONE): Oh.

605
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:20,912
Dinner?

606
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,481
Yes.

607
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:23,882
I haven't seen you
in at least a month.

608
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:25,584
And since I always take
you out on your birthday,

609
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:26,852
I thought it would
be a good way to kill

610
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:28,120
two birds with one stone.

611
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:29,054
Well, thank you, Paula.

612
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:30,555
That's really nice.

613
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:32,891
But I can't tomorrow.

614
00:21:32,924 --> 00:21:33,792
Maybe next week.

615
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:35,460
I can't next week.

616
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:36,561
Tomorrow's good.

617
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:37,829
Well, then the week after.

618
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:38,864
I can't the week after.

619
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:40,032
Tomorrow's good.

620
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:41,500
Well, my birthday's
not for weeks.

621
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:43,702
I mean, we can do
it some other time.

622
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:46,104
Paula?

623
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:46,972
Paula?

624
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:54,613
Happy 30th birthday, even if
it's not for another few weeks.

625
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:55,480
Thank you, Paula.

626
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:02,721
So seeing anyone
new these days?

627
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:04,856
Why do you want to know?

628
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,491
I'm just curious.

629
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:07,426
No.

630
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:08,927
I'm not seeing anyone.

631
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,896
Hm.

632
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:11,830
Have you been on any dates?

633
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:13,098
Yes.

634
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:14,166
I've been on a few dates.

635
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:16,568
Well, tell me.

636
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:17,969
I don't think so.

637
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:18,870
Jimmy.

638
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:21,440
Paula.

639
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:22,741
I just want to make
sure you're happy.

640
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:26,712
Paula, every
time we go out, you

641
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:28,447
always ask me who I'm dating.

642
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,049
That always leads to talking
about when we were going out,

643
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:33,485
which always leads to
you telling me what

644
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:36,154
was wrong with our relationship,
which leads to you telling

645
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,723
me what is wrong with me.

646
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:39,725
And that always leads
to you telling me how

647
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:40,992
happy you are now with Gregory.

648
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,829
So let's just talk
about something else.

649
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,464
OK?

650
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:46,465
That is not true.

651
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:47,766
Paula, please.

652
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:48,600
OK.

653
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:56,875
Are you still seeing Mimi?

654
00:22:56,908 --> 00:22:58,009
Do you mean, are
we still friends?

655
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:58,777
Yes.
Friends.

656
00:22:58,810 --> 00:22:59,845
Whatever.

657
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:00,779
Yeah.

658
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:02,581
I still see Mimi.

659
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:03,749
Hm.

660
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:06,485
How is she?

661
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:10,455
Why do you loathe
her so, Paul?

662
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:13,625
I don't loathe her, Jimmy.

663
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:20,999
I think she's a very nice
person for the person she is.

664
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:21,900
For the--

665
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:22,768
Sushi.

666
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:37,182
For the person she is.

667
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:38,550
What's that supposed to mean?

668
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,986
Nothing.

669
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:42,154
Really.

670
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:44,089
[scoffs]

671
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:45,090
OK.

672
00:23:45,123 --> 00:23:51,930
I just think she's so plain.

673
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:53,231
You know.

674
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,133
I just think you can do better.
That's all.

675
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:56,067
Better than what?

676
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:58,236
She's just a friend.

677
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,105
She is just a friend.
Really?

678
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:01,039
Yes, Paula.

679
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:02,574
Really.

680
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:03,642
I can't believe you're
still jealous of her.

681
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:08,547
I am not jealous of her.

682
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,516
And I never have been.

683
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:12,784
I'm sorry.

684
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:15,587
You're right.

685
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:22,894
Besides how could
I be jealous of her.

686
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:24,196
She could never
have what we had.

687
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:26,064
Paula.

688
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:27,132
PAULA: Do you ever
think about us?

689
00:24:27,165 --> 00:24:28,166
Paula, please.

690
00:24:35,106 --> 00:24:38,610
I mean it, Jimmy.

691
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:44,749
Sometimes when I'm alone I
remember some of the nights

692
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:46,084
and some of the things we did.

693
00:24:46,117 --> 00:24:49,187
Do you remember.

694
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:50,155
Yes.

695
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:51,623
[breathes]

696
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:56,027
Do you ever think
about those nights?

697
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:57,996
I mean, when you're alone.

698
00:24:58,029 --> 00:24:58,930
Yeah.

699
00:24:58,964 --> 00:24:59,831
Sometimes.

700
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:04,202
Do you miss them?

701
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:08,907
Yeah.
Sometimes.

702
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,175
[gasps]

703
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:15,780
PAULA: So do I. We
were hot, weren't we?

704
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:16,615
Mhm.

705
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:29,294
But then I always remember
how unhappy you made me.

706
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:30,228
[snaps]

707
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:33,064
And it just goes away.

708
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:33,899
Mhm.

709
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:39,104
We're better off this way.

710
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:41,172
You know, I'm so much
happier with Gregory.

711
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:45,176
[laughs under his breath]

712
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,244
Someday you'll find
somebody, Jimmy.

713
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:54,920
JANE DOE: And you
still see this woman?

714
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:58,089
Oh, at first I didn't want to.

715
00:25:58,123 --> 00:26:01,693
But she was pretty
insistent about it.

716
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,628
And, you know, I kind of always
believe that people should

717
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:04,896
be friends after they break up.

718
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:05,897
JANE DOE: Oh.

719
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:07,399
Do you really believe that?

720
00:26:07,432 --> 00:26:08,400
Yeah.

721
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:10,268
Well, I've always tried to.

722
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:12,003
JANE DOE: Mhm.

723
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:15,674
But after a while, I began
to wonder why she dumped me.

724
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:18,109
You know, I mean, what did
he have that I didn't have?

725
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:23,081
So I'd go out with
her to find out.

726
00:26:23,114 --> 00:26:24,849
JANE DOE: So did you
eventually find out?

727
00:26:24,883 --> 00:26:26,151
Yeah.

728
00:26:26,184 --> 00:26:28,653
She finally told me
one night straight out.

729
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:31,022
We were eating Italian.

730
00:26:31,056 --> 00:26:35,060
And it reminded her of how much
she hated my table manners.

731
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,928
JANE DOE: Your table manners?

732
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:38,330
Yeah.

733
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:40,699
I cut my spaghetti.

734
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:42,267
Well, she flipped out.

735
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,803
She said that no Italian
man would be caught

736
00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:46,671
dead cutting his spaghetti.

737
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:49,774
Then she pointed out that no
Italian man would be caught

738
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:51,309
dead wearing my clothes either.

739
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:55,146
She even hated the fact that
I wasn't Italian, or French,

740
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,315
or something different.

741
00:26:57,349 --> 00:27:02,087
And now she never
stops telling me.

742
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,456
JANE DOE: Are you a masochist?

743
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:05,357
Masochist?

744
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:06,358
No.

745
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:07,859
What do you mean, masochist?

746
00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:09,294
JANE DOE: Well, let
me get this straight.

747
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:11,796
You must love this woman
if you're still seeing her.

748
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:12,764
No.

749
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:15,834
I am not in love with Paula.

750
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:17,302
JANE DOE: Well, if you're
not in love with her,

751
00:27:17,335 --> 00:27:19,037
it was a painful relationship.

752
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,872
She dumped you you moved
in with somebody else.

753
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:22,974
And you're still seeing her?

754
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:26,911
You're either a
masochist or an idiot.

755
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:31,383
SEAN: You're an idiot.

756
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:32,751
JIMMY: I beg your pardon?
- No.

757
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:34,219
She's right.
You're an idiot.

758
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:37,188
And I've been telling
you that for years.

759
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:38,923
Just because I think
it's right to stay

760
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:42,193
friends with a woman after
we've broken up, I'm an idiot.

761
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:44,195
Jim, what's the point?

762
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:45,230
I mean, look at it.

763
00:27:45,263 --> 00:27:46,931
You're not getting laid.

764
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:48,933
And chances are, you never will.

765
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:51,836
Worst of all, she's a bitch.

766
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:54,239
Sean, every woman
is a bitch to you.

767
00:27:54,272 --> 00:27:55,206
Yeah.

768
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,475
But I mean it with Paula.

769
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,010
I don't get it.

770
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:02,313
She's fucking somebody
else and she dumps you.

771
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:05,216
A week later, she's
shacked up with the guy.

772
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:09,054
Now, nobody should have to
take that kind of abuse.

773
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:10,488
Why do you still see her?

774
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,390
Because, I mean, if we
can't be friends with a woman

775
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:13,858
just because we
slept with them, I

776
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:15,160
mean, where does that leave us?

777
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,962
Oh, it leaves us to
move on to the next one.

778
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:19,497
That's where.

779
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,766
I don't want to be friends
with women I've gone out with.

780
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,967
It just doesn't work.

781
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:23,968
Maybe that's
because you were never

782
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:25,103
their friends to begin with.

783
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:26,871
What?

784
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:28,273
Face it.

785
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:30,308
You just can't handle
being friends with women.

786
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:32,010
At least Jimmy's trying.

787
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:33,945
You're not mature enough,
and you don't respect them.

788
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:35,146
All right.

789
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,281
What about you?

790
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:37,882
What?

791
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:40,085
I have no trouble being
friends with women.

792
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:42,087
I respect and truly like the
women I've gone out with.

793
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,021
They are my friends.

794
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,289
Exactly.

795
00:28:44,322 --> 00:28:46,558
All your friends except
for us are women.

796
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:49,027
So.

797
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,563
So you're like
their little pet.

798
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:54,165
I mean, what do you get
out of those relationships?

799
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:56,501
Stimulating conversation?

800
00:28:56,534 --> 00:28:58,103
Certainly not sex.

801
00:28:58,136 --> 00:29:00,338
I mean, Jimmy over here
may be a little mixed up.

802
00:29:00,371 --> 00:29:02,507
But at least he's getting
foop once in a while.

803
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,509
[sighs]

804
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:06,911
It always comes
down to sex with you.

805
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:11,449
Does a friendship with a
woman require a sexual favor?

806
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:13,084
You are so full of shit.

807
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:15,954
If they were willing
you'd grab it in a second.

808
00:29:15,987 --> 00:29:17,288
Your ignorance is
truly astounding.

809
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:19,057
This is a lovely
bearnaise sauce, Sean.

810
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,358
Oh, thanks.

811
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:21,359
All right.

812
00:29:21,392 --> 00:29:23,428
What about what's her name?

813
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:26,998
Your latest best friend?

814
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:28,366
Who?
Shanti?

815
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:29,501
Yeah.

816
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:31,102
Shanti.

817
00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:32,537
Don't tell me you wouldn't
foop her if she let you.

818
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:34,172
Leave her out of this.

819
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:36,441
Look, I'm not a walking
hard on like you.

820
00:29:36,474 --> 00:29:38,910
And I don't happen to
want to foop Shanti.

821
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:41,079
Oh, what was that?

822
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,548
Did I hear someone
mention the word denial?

823
00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:45,116
- I'm not denying anything.
- Yep.

824
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,084
Yep.

825
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:46,985
Capital D-E. Yep.
Yep.

826
00:29:47,018 --> 00:29:47,919
Denial.

827
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,921
TIM: You know, it's sad.

828
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:51,556
You really have no idea
what you're talking about.

829
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:53,391
It is so sad listening
to you go on like this.

830
00:29:53,424 --> 00:29:54,526
Yeah.

831
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,928
Well, sad as it
is, at least I've

832
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:58,596
had sex in the last two years.

833
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,165
Which is more than I
can say for you, Timbo.

834
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:01,599
Yeah.

835
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,101
Well, at least I'm not going
to die of some sexually

836
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:04,169
transmitted disease.

837
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:06,471
[gulp]
- Excuse me.

838
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:09,974
I'll be right back.

839
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:10,875
[chuckles]

840
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:25,190
[sigh]

841
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:31,329
You know what those are.

842
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:32,163
Don't you?

843
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:45,310
[phone ringing]

844
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:48,446
Hi there.

845
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:50,181
It's late.
I'm tired.

846
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:52,116
And you've got a lot of nerve
to be calling at this hour.

847
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:53,384
So get to the point.

848
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:54,953
MIMI (ON PHONE):
Hey, hey, Jimmy, boy.

849
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:55,687
What's up, babe?

850
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,621
Hey, hey.

851
00:30:56,654 --> 00:30:57,989
It's Mimi.

852
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:00,592
Oh, just sitting
here, writing away.

853
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:02,660
And how goes the
great epic novel?

854
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,963
JIMMY (ON PHONE): Well,
you know, a word here.

855
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:06,264
A sentence there.

856
00:31:06,297 --> 00:31:07,932
Oh, it sounds
like a method, Jim.

857
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:09,267
JIMMY (ON PHONE): Yep.
I tell you.

858
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,302
Once I get some of those
paragraphs going, woo.

859
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:14,072
[chuckles]

860
00:31:14,105 --> 00:31:15,106
Is that water I hear?

861
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:16,074
Uh-huh.

862
00:31:16,107 --> 00:31:17,041
Listen.

863
00:31:17,075 --> 00:31:18,576
How about lunch tomorrow?

864
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:20,044
You aren't calling me from
the baththub again, are you?

865
00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:21,112
MIMI (ON PHONE): Uh-huh.

866
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:23,114
God.
Have you no mercy?

867
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:24,048
[giggles]

868
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:25,116
Oh, jeez.

869
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:27,151
A little frustrated, are we?

870
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:30,355
All alone here with
the vision of that body

871
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:32,023
in a tub of steaming water?

872
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:32,957
Who wouldn't be?

873
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:35,059
Who wouldn't be?

874
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:37,128
Well, flattery will
get you everywhere.

875
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:38,096
JIMMY (ON PHONE): Yeah.

876
00:31:38,129 --> 00:31:39,330
Not with you, it doesn't.

877
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:41,332
Well, maybe you
just give up too easy.

878
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:43,568
Maybe you don't
give in easy enough.

879
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:47,372
Well, maybe I do
and maybe I don't.

880
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:48,539
Anyhow, we do lunch tomorrow?

881
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:49,474
Yeah.

882
00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:50,375
Usual place?

883
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:51,442
The usual place.

884
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:53,044
Sleep tight.
- OK.

885
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:54,078
You too.

886
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,246
Don't miss any spots.

887
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,181
I'll be doing
inspection tomorrow.

888
00:31:57,215 --> 00:31:58,583
Ooh.

889
00:31:58,616 --> 00:32:00,752
I'll be thinking about you
while I'm toweling off.

890
00:32:00,785 --> 00:32:03,121
- Oh, good.
- Goodnight.

891
00:32:03,154 --> 00:32:05,256
Bye.

892
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:08,059
[beep]

893
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,560
God, I hate that woman.

894
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:12,096
[music playing]

895
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:17,168

00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:33,184
(SINGING) What you say
is all well and fine.

00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:36,187
What I'm losing is
the bottom line.

901
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:41,092
You have to say those things
that are on your mind.

902
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:46,297
[clears throat]

903
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:49,200
[sighs]

904
00:32:52,203 --> 00:32:53,771
MIMI: So before
he even finished,

905
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,707
I told him that was
the most pathetic

906
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,475
come on line I'd ever heard.

907
00:32:57,508 --> 00:32:59,143
And on top of that, it wasn't
the first time I'd heard it.

908
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:01,079
Ooh.
So what'd he do then?

909
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:02,313
Well, let's see.

910
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:04,482
He-- well, he called me a cunt.

911
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:07,318
Told me I was probably
a lousy fuck anyway.

912
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:10,088
And then he walked straight up
to another girl to try again.

913
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:11,489
Ouch.

914
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:13,391
Aw, I hate guys like that.

915
00:33:13,424 --> 00:33:14,492
You hate them?
Why?

916
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:15,727
It's not your problem.

917
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,562
- Sure, it is.
- No, it's not.

918
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:19,430
I'm the one who has to deal
with schmucks like that.

919
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:20,665
Yeah.

920
00:33:20,698 --> 00:33:22,333
But I'm the one that
has to pay for it.

921
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:23,301
Oh, you.

922
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:24,669
How do you pay for it?

923
00:33:24,702 --> 00:33:27,372
When the guy walked
off, how'd you feel?

924
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:28,306
I was pissed off.

925
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:29,273
Exactly.

926
00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:31,209
So say you didn't know me.

927
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:33,177
And, you know, I walked up
to you five minutes later

928
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:34,379
and tried to strike
up a conversation.

929
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:36,114
What would you say?

930
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:37,348
I'd um--

931
00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:38,750
I'd probably tell
you to take a hike.

932
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:40,218
Right.

933
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:41,419
I mean, you're so angry,
you shut the door.

934
00:33:41,452 --> 00:33:42,353
And your night is shot.

935
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:44,756
So I'm the one who pays.

936
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:48,493
I mean, boneheads like that guy
ruin it for all us other guys.

937
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:51,796
Well, maybe if you were
like a really nice guy.

938
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:54,332
Mimi, women have
become so jaded,

939
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:56,467
they wouldn't know a nice guy
if he saved her from a dragon.

940
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:59,404
I mean, there's-- there's
just too many schmucks

941
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:01,205
like that guy out there.

942
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:02,840
I mean, jerks with
lousy lines like that

943
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,742
ruin it for jerks like me.

944
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:05,843
What?
With other lousy lines?

945
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:06,778
That's right.

946
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:08,446
And I swear to god.

947
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:09,714
That guy is following me
around, hitting on every woman

948
00:34:09,747 --> 00:34:10,848
just before I do.

949
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:11,783
[giggling]

950
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:16,788
Uh.

951
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:18,790
Jimmy.

952
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:21,259
What?

953
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:22,627
- I can't believe you.
- Why?

954
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:23,728
What's wrong?

955
00:34:23,761 --> 00:34:24,762
Well, what?

956
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:26,264
Have you got whiplash?

957
00:34:26,297 --> 00:34:27,565
Did you see the way
your head just jerked

958
00:34:27,598 --> 00:34:28,666
around when she walked by?

959
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:30,301
You're a pig.

960
00:34:30,334 --> 00:34:31,569
I was just looking
at the woman.

961
00:34:31,602 --> 00:34:33,204
Well, do you
know what it feels

962
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:34,572
like to be looked at like that?

963
00:34:34,605 --> 00:34:35,606
It's degrading.

964
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,541
Degrading?

965
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:37,909
My god, Mimi.

966
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:38,910
She was a beautiful woman.
I was just looking.

967
00:34:38,943 --> 00:34:40,278
Yeah.

968
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:41,312
Well, I don't think
she appreciates

969
00:34:41,345 --> 00:34:42,780
the way you were just looking.

970
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:45,149
Well, I don't
think she minded it.

971
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:46,250
Oh, come on.

972
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:47,218
The makeup.

973
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:48,252
The outfit.

974
00:34:48,286 --> 00:34:49,487
The woman wants to be looked at.

975
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,155
You were undressing
her with your eyes.

976
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:52,323
I didn't have to.

977
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:56,160
She wasn't wearing that much.

978
00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:58,596
What's gotten into you?

979
00:34:58,629 --> 00:35:01,499
You disappoint me, Jimmy.

980
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:04,302
Mimi, she was a gorgeous
woman, and I was just looking.

981
00:35:04,335 --> 00:35:06,471
I'm not going to let you
make me feel guilty for that.

982
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:07,338
OK.

983
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:13,478
[knocking]

984
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:15,680
JANE DOE: Women think about
sex just as much as men.

985
00:35:15,713 --> 00:35:17,515
Yeah.
But you just said they don't.

986
00:35:17,548 --> 00:35:19,250
JANE DOE: No, I didn't.

987
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:21,252
I just meant they don't think
about it in the same way.

988
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:21,953
Right.

989
00:35:21,986 --> 00:35:23,454
OK.

990
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:25,590
Look, what I want to
know is, do women not

991
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:27,792
look at men because they
just don't think about it?

992
00:35:27,825 --> 00:35:29,727
Do they not look on purpose?

993
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,762
Or do they think
they're not supposed to?

994
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,564
JANE DOE: It's not a
question of whether they're

995
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:35,600
supposed to or not.

996
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:37,635
Women can do anything
they damn well please.

997
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:38,903
Look, I could not agree more.

998
00:35:38,936 --> 00:35:40,872
But the way this stupid
society is setup,

999
00:35:40,905 --> 00:35:43,274
the man always has to
chase after the woman.

1000
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:44,909
So, of course, he's
always looking.

1001
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:46,777
And because the woman
is being chased,

1002
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,813
she doesn't have to look,
because, theoretically, she

1003
00:35:48,846 --> 00:35:49,847
shouldn't have to.
Right?

1004
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:50,748
No.

1005
00:35:50,781 --> 00:35:51,816
I don't know about that.

1006
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:52,750
This is the '90s.

1007
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:53,718
Right?

1008
00:35:53,751 --> 00:35:55,419
JANE DOE: Yeah.

1009
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:58,256
When was the last time you
asked a man out on a date?

1010
00:35:58,289 --> 00:35:59,524
JANE DOE: You're not
allowed to ask me--

1011
00:35:59,557 --> 00:35:59,924
JIMMY: No.
No.

1012
00:35:59,957 --> 00:36:00,658
No.

1013
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:01,459
No.
No.

1014
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:02,293
Come on.
Come on.

1015
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:03,761
This is important.

1016
00:36:03,794 --> 00:36:04,896
When was the last time you
asked a man out on a date?

1017
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:05,863
JANE DOE: Don't
ask me questions.

1018
00:36:05,897 --> 00:36:07,365
OK.
OK.

1019
00:36:07,398 --> 00:36:08,799
Well, then can we say
for argument's sake,

1020
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,902
it's probably not that often?

1021
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:11,903
JANE DOE: OK.

1022
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:13,538
Great.

1023
00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:15,573
So here we are in the '90s,
after more than 20 years

1024
00:36:15,606 --> 00:36:18,342
of modern feminism, and women
are still sitting back waiting

1025
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:19,544
for guys to ask them out.

1026
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:20,778
JANE DOE: No, they're not!

1027
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:22,246
Yes, they are.

1028
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,781
Practically every woman
friend that I have

1029
00:36:23,814 --> 00:36:25,449
complains about how
they never go out.

1030
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:27,785
And then when they do the
guy was always a schmuck.

1031
00:36:27,818 --> 00:36:29,787
But they never get off their
asses and do anything about it.

1032
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,322
JANE DOE: Yeah.

1033
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:32,590
Well, you know exactly
what a man thinks when

1034
00:36:32,623 --> 00:36:33,758
the woman makes the first move.

1035
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:35,359
No.
What?

1036
00:36:35,393 --> 00:36:36,694
JANE DOE: He freaks
out because he doesn't

1037
00:36:36,727 --> 00:36:38,329
have control of the situation.

1038
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:39,864
Bullshit!

1039
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:42,433
I do not know one man
who would not rather have

1040
00:36:42,466 --> 00:36:43,701
the woman make the first move.

1041
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:44,969
I mean, we always have
to risk rejection.

1042
00:36:45,002 --> 00:36:46,537
Do you know what that's like?

1043
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:47,705
JANE DOE: Yeah, Rovinski.

1044
00:36:47,738 --> 00:36:49,440
I do happen to know
what it's like.

1045
00:36:49,473 --> 00:36:50,942
And if women aren't
asking men out,

1046
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:52,877
it's because men
just can't take it.

1047
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,645
Oh, I don't know that
there are too many men that

1048
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:56,347
are thinking like that anymore.

1049
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,349
And besides, even if you do
run into a guy like that,

1050
00:36:58,382 --> 00:36:59,584
it ought to take you
about two seconds

1051
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:01,285
to figure him out and dump him.
Right?

1052
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:02,553
JANE DOE: No.

1053
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:03,588
It's not as simple
as you make it sound.

1054
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:04,922
Oh, I think it's very simple.

1055
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:06,591
I think when it comes
to initiating things,

1056
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:08,459
men have had the short end
of the stick for too long.

1057
00:37:08,492 --> 00:37:10,328
JANE DOE: Men have had the
short end of the stick?

1058
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:11,462
JIMMY: Yes.
Men!

1059
00:37:11,495 --> 00:37:12,597
I think it's about
time that women

1060
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,432
took some of the risks too.

1061
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:15,766
But I'm not saying I'm
going to wait around

1062
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,034
for a woman to call me up.

1063
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,536
I already tried that
and it didn't work.

1064
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:19,470
JANE DOE: Gee.

1065
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:21,839
Big surprise, Rovinski.

1066
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:23,007
Thank you, Jane.

1067
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,775
You know, I can
just see how quickly

1068
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:26,911
the world is going to change
with charmers like you around.

1069
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:31,816
[blows smoke]

1070
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:36,921
SEAN: Hey, guys.

1071
00:37:36,954 --> 00:37:38,923
Remember Ramona Klein?

1072
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:39,991
Yeah.

1073
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:41,759
Well, last week
I saw her having

1074
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:44,662
dinner with Teddy Pripstein.

1075
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:46,063
Ew.

1076
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,832
So I'm sitting
there, trying to eat.

1077
00:37:47,865 --> 00:37:49,100
Right?

1078
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:50,334
He starts kissing her.

1079
00:37:50,368 --> 00:37:51,068
Ew.

1080
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:51,969
Oh.

1081
00:37:52,003 --> 00:37:52,903
Yeah.

1082
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:53,871
But get this.

1083
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:55,539
She wasn't kissing him.

1084
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:57,541
She was just letting
him kiss her.

1085
00:37:57,575 --> 00:37:58,743
What do you mean?

1086
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,011
Well, she was
letting everyone around

1087
00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:02,013
know that even though
she was with him,

1088
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:03,447
she didn't want to be with him.

1089
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:04,382
Yeah.

1090
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:05,983
So.

1091
00:38:06,017 --> 00:38:07,618
Well, don't you get it?

1092
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:09,887
She's showing everyone that
she's available in case

1093
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,056
something better comes along.

1094
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:14,425
She's not tight with Pripstein.

1095
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:18,562
But she's keeping him
close, just in case.

1096
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:20,965
Ramona Klein was the hottest
girl I knew in college.

1097
00:38:20,998 --> 00:38:22,600
I mean, everybody wanted
to go out with her.

1098
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:23,868
- I didn't.
- Heh.

1099
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:24,869
You mean couldn't.

1100
00:38:24,902 --> 00:38:25,803
No.

1101
00:38:25,836 --> 00:38:26,937
I mean, didn't.

1102
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,406
I never found her
that attractive.

1103
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:29,140
You're nuts.

1104
00:38:29,173 --> 00:38:30,541
She's incredible.

1105
00:38:30,574 --> 00:38:31,709
Just look in any
fashion magazine.

1106
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:32,877
There's lots of
women just like her.

1107
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:33,811
Yeah.

1108
00:38:33,844 --> 00:38:36,414
Well, I'd do her.

1109
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:39,550
Well, you know, I might
have done her if her bum

1110
00:38:39,583 --> 00:38:41,385
was just a little bit smaller.

1111
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:42,086
What?

1112
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:43,387
Her bums too big.

1113
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:44,121
Yes.

1114
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,823
She has a nice face.

1115
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:47,925
But I don't like her bum.

1116
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:50,661
And god knows what you'll
find when her bra comes off.

1117
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:51,562
Woo.

1118
00:38:51,595 --> 00:38:53,130
Breasts?

1119
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:57,001
Yea-- didn't you say you were
going to quit smoking today?

1120
00:38:57,034 --> 00:38:58,135
Did you hear today?

1121
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,638
I said tomorrow.

1122
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:03,607
Ramona Klein had guys falling
all over her 10 years ago.

1123
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:07,845
And now she's hanging
out with Teddy Pripstein.

1124
00:39:07,878 --> 00:39:08,779
That's kind of sad.

1125
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:10,548
What's so sad about it?

1126
00:39:10,581 --> 00:39:12,883
10 years ago the woman never
had any problems getting men.

1127
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:14,618
She could pick and choose.

1128
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:16,554
Well, she got too picky, and
now she's paying the price.

1129
00:39:16,587 --> 00:39:17,488
Jesus.

1130
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:19,423
You sound bitter.

1131
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:20,491
I'm not bitter.

1132
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:21,425
I just think it's justice.

1133
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:22,560
Justice?

1134
00:39:22,593 --> 00:39:23,828
What has justice
got to do with it?

1135
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:25,896
Look, 10 years ago
I couldn't get a date

1136
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,565
if my life depended
on it, especially

1137
00:39:27,598 --> 00:39:29,133
not with a woman like that.

1138
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:31,168
I just think it's justice to
see things coming around a bit.

1139
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:32,770
That's all.

1140
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:34,939
But you still
can't get a date.

1141
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:36,640
That's not the point.

1142
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:37,908
JIMMY: No.
No.

1143
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:39,143
It is the point.

1144
00:39:39,176 --> 00:39:40,678
I mean, you're right, Tim.

1145
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:43,514
Romona Klein could pick
and choose 10 years ago.

1146
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,750
Well, why not now?

1147
00:39:45,783 --> 00:39:48,519
And why is it that 10
years ago women like Ramona

1148
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:50,454
always dumped me?

1149
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:51,655
They always had control.

1150
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:52,556
Whoa.

1151
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:53,657
Whoa.

1152
00:39:53,691 --> 00:39:55,159
Snap out of it, son.

1153
00:39:55,192 --> 00:39:57,661
You've done your fair share
of trashing relationships.

1154
00:39:57,695 --> 00:39:59,130
But don't you see?

1155
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:01,599
That is exactly the point.

1156
00:40:01,632 --> 00:40:03,834
It's all a power thing.

1157
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:05,636
And that's what's
so sad about Ramona.

1158
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:08,038
She thinks that just
because she's hit 30,

1159
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:10,975
she hasn't got power anymore.

1160
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:13,611
It's a cruel world, Jimmy boy.

1161
00:40:13,644 --> 00:40:15,246
And Ramona's proof.

1162
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:17,882
A cruel, cruel world.

1163
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:19,183
[sighs]

1164
00:40:29,627 --> 00:40:31,262
I'm just not willing to
settle for any of the men

1165
00:40:31,295 --> 00:40:32,530
I've gone out with.

1166
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:33,764
Why should I?

1167
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:35,199
I mean, I'm not to
settle for some guy

1168
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:38,102
just because I want to
get married and have kids.

1169
00:40:38,135 --> 00:40:40,070
No way.

1170
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:41,739
I'd rather be alone.

1171
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:42,640
Wait.

1172
00:40:42,673 --> 00:40:44,041
Let me guess.

1173
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:46,811
You want someone who is
good looking, intelligent,

1174
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:49,213
can be your best friend, and
happens to be a great lay.

1175
00:40:49,246 --> 00:40:50,147
Right?

1176
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:51,048
Yeah.

1177
00:40:51,081 --> 00:40:53,117
And he loves kids too.

1178
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:55,152
Wakey wakey, Joe.

1179
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:56,687
All that sensitive
guy double talk

1180
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,823
is bullshit The
experiment proves it.

1181
00:40:58,856 --> 00:40:59,757
He doesn't exist.

1182
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:00,758
Yeah, he does.

1183
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:01,692
Mm.

1184
00:41:01,725 --> 00:41:03,093
No.

1185
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:04,728
There are three types of
men in this world, honey.

1186
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:06,063
Men you're friends with.

1187
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:08,732
Men who pay the bills
and you have kids with.

1188
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:10,868
And men you fuck.

1189
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:12,837
And I plan to have
plenty of all three.

1190
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,238
Well, that is pretty cynical.

1191
00:41:14,271 --> 00:41:15,272
Don't you think?

1192
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:16,307
Bullshit, cynical.

1193
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:17,675
It's reality.

1194
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:18,809
Hi, there.

1195
00:41:18,843 --> 00:41:20,544
My name's Sean,
and I just thought

1196
00:41:20,578 --> 00:41:22,713
I'd drop by and say hello.

1197
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:24,281
Well, thank you.

1198
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:27,084
But we would have asked you
if we wanted you to say hello.

1199
00:41:27,117 --> 00:41:29,053
Well, then I'll get
right to the point.

1200
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:30,821
I simply dropped
by to extend to you

1201
00:41:30,855 --> 00:41:33,657
both an invitation to a party
we're having Saturday night.

1202
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:39,597
JANE DOE: Duh Boys?

1203
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:40,297
SEAN: Yeah.

1204
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:42,833
You know, the boys.

1205
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:44,168
Duh boys.

1206
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:46,337
Duh boys.
Heh, heh.

1207
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:49,740
It's a little play on words
my roommate Jimmy thought up.

1208
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:50,774
Mm.

1209
00:41:50,808 --> 00:41:51,675
SEAN: Cool.

1210
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:53,010
Huh?
- Do her?

1211
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:54,745
I expect that from
erection head over there.

1212
00:41:54,778 --> 00:41:57,047
Think you can do her?

1213
00:41:57,081 --> 00:41:57,948
SEAN: So what do you say?

1214
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:03,287
Saturday night?

1215
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,355
Joe.

1216
00:42:04,388 --> 00:42:06,290
8 o'clock.

1217
00:42:06,323 --> 00:42:08,859
WOMAN: Joe!

1218
00:42:08,893 --> 00:42:11,262
I'll be there.

1219
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:13,130
[music playing]

1220
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:17,868
TIM: It has nothing to do
with pollution, dimwit.

1221
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:19,670
It's the lights from the city.

1222
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:20,604
No, it's not.

1223
00:42:20,638 --> 00:42:21,338
Yes, it is.

1224
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:22,273
Fuck off.

1225
00:42:22,306 --> 00:42:24,074
Look it up, Einstein.

1226
00:42:24,108 --> 00:42:27,211
You're saying the light from
a city is bright enough to block

1227
00:42:27,244 --> 00:42:28,312
out the light from a star?

1228
00:42:28,345 --> 00:42:29,213
Yes.

1229
00:42:29,246 --> 00:42:30,681
Not a chance.

1230
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:31,849
Those stars are sun.

1231
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:32,883
That's right.

1232
00:42:32,917 --> 00:42:34,318
About 10 trillion miles away.

1233
00:42:34,351 --> 00:42:35,252
So what?

1234
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:36,186
They're suns.

1235
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,655
Excuse me, Mr. MBA.

1236
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:39,690
But did you do a
degree in astronomy

1237
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:40,391
while we weren't looking?

1238
00:42:40,424 --> 00:42:41,325
Come on.

1239
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:42,326
It's common sense.

1240
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:44,028
Yeah.

1241
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:45,729
And I suppose they put those
telescopes on mountaintops

1242
00:42:45,763 --> 00:42:47,798
in the deepest, darkest
forests of South

1243
00:42:47,831 --> 00:42:49,366
America out of common sense.

1244
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,401
Yeah.

1245
00:42:50,434 --> 00:42:52,202
There's no pollution out there.

1246
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:53,971
Jimmy, settle this.

1247
00:42:54,004 --> 00:42:55,973
Why can't we see as
many stars in the city?

1248
00:42:56,006 --> 00:42:59,209
Lights or pollution?

1249
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:02,746
What's the most romantic
night you guys ever had?

1250
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,114
Uh-oh.

1251
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:05,082
[sighs]

1252
00:43:05,115 --> 00:43:06,417
Gee, I don't know, Sean.

1253
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:08,786
What is the most romantic
night we ever had?

1254
00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:12,957
Rovinski, every time we sleep
out here, you turn to mush.

1255
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:15,693
When you get drunk you start
kissing us and telling us

1256
00:43:15,726 --> 00:43:17,227
how much you love us.

1257
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:20,698
And when we sleep out, you
always start talking like this.

1258
00:43:20,731 --> 00:43:22,066
Jesus.

1259
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:25,736
I remember the most
romantic night I ever had.

1260
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:28,939
I was backpacking in
Italy, and I just started

1261
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:32,276
seeing this girl named--

1262
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:33,777
Daniella.

1263
00:43:33,811 --> 00:43:35,312
Yeah.

1264
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:36,146
Daniella.

1265
00:43:39,984 --> 00:43:43,754
We were at this rooftop
party in Florence.

1266
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:46,156
It was the beginning of
summer, and everything

1267
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:49,426
was just starting to bloom.

1268
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,729
It was warm.

1269
00:43:51,762 --> 00:43:53,764
And the air was so
thick and perfumed

1270
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:56,800
you could almost cut it.

1271
00:43:56,834 --> 00:43:58,235
And all night long
I just couldn't

1272
00:43:58,268 --> 00:44:02,473
stop staring at her,
what she was wearing,

1273
00:44:02,506 --> 00:44:09,313
her hair, her skin, her eyes.

1274
00:44:09,346 --> 00:44:11,081
I couldn't believe that
I was with this woman.

1275
00:44:11,115 --> 00:44:12,149
I mean, she was
just too amazing.

1276
00:44:14,952 --> 00:44:16,320
Everybody was speaking Italian.

1277
00:44:16,353 --> 00:44:17,988
And I couldn't
understand a word.

1278
00:44:18,022 --> 00:44:20,357
But it didn't matter.

1279
00:44:24,294 --> 00:44:27,965
We both knew that we were going
to make love for the first time

1280
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:30,000
that night.

1281
00:44:30,034 --> 00:44:34,371
And we were in no rush.

1282
00:44:34,405 --> 00:44:35,873
Oh.

1283
00:44:35,906 --> 00:44:38,409
I could've stayed at
that party all night.

1284
00:44:38,442 --> 00:44:42,146
It was like I could
feel time passing.

1285
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:47,051
Like it was washing past me,
like wind making me squint.

1286
00:44:49,987 --> 00:44:50,854
I loved every minute.

1287
00:44:54,124 --> 00:44:56,994
And when we got back
to her apartment,

1288
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:58,495
we didn't even have
to turn on the lights.

1289
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:01,932
It was one of those weird
nights where it wasn't dark.

1290
00:45:01,965 --> 00:45:04,935
It was just kind of--

1291
00:45:04,968 --> 00:45:05,803
just kind of blue.

1292
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:11,341
SEAN: And?

1293
00:45:15,245 --> 00:45:16,914
You did it?

1294
00:45:16,947 --> 00:45:19,216
[laughs]

1295
00:45:19,249 --> 00:45:21,952
Till it got light.

1296
00:45:21,985 --> 00:45:22,886
Yeah.

1297
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,489
I was religious.

1298
00:45:25,522 --> 00:45:26,423
I didn't want it to end.

1299
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:33,030
In a way I wish it
had never happened.

1300
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:34,364
How come?

1301
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:39,002
Well, because nothing's
ever been as good since.

1302
00:45:39,036 --> 00:45:40,437
Gee, that's tough, Jim.

1303
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:41,371
Yeah.

1304
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:43,307
We really feel for you.

1305
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:46,376
Yeah, but don't you guys ever
worry about giving that up?

1306
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:47,911
TIM: What?

1307
00:45:47,945 --> 00:45:50,180
Well, the first
time with somebody.

1308
00:45:50,214 --> 00:45:52,816
I mean, I think sometimes
that's the main reason

1309
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:54,184
I'll never get married.

1310
00:45:54,218 --> 00:45:55,986
So don't get married.

1311
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:57,287
What's the big deal?

1312
00:45:57,321 --> 00:45:58,322
No.

1313
00:45:58,355 --> 00:46:00,057
But I would like to get married.

1314
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:02,559
I mean, I'd like to be able
to spend the rest of my life

1315
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:07,297
with somebody, I think.

1316
00:46:07,331 --> 00:46:09,099
I don't worry about it.

1317
00:46:09,133 --> 00:46:11,401
I'll know when it's right.

1318
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:14,204
I know it won't be
right for a long time.

1319
00:46:14,238 --> 00:46:15,539
But I'll know when it's right.

1320
00:46:15,572 --> 00:46:16,440
Yeah.

1321
00:46:16,473 --> 00:46:18,342
Well, I worry about it.

1322
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:20,944
I mean, whenever I'm willing
to commit to somebody,

1323
00:46:20,978 --> 00:46:22,412
they're not interested
in committing to me.

1324
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:24,548
And whenever somebody
wants me to commit,

1325
00:46:24,581 --> 00:46:26,884
I'm not interested in them.

1326
00:46:26,917 --> 00:46:31,121
TIM: Jim, timing's everything.

1327
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:32,556
JIMMY: Yeah.

1328
00:46:32,589 --> 00:46:38,095
Well, I think I've gone numb.

1329
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:40,364
Don't sweat it, Jim.

1330
00:46:40,397 --> 00:46:42,132
Men and women were
never meant to be

1331
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:44,268
together for extended
periods of time anyway.

1332
00:46:48,338 --> 00:46:51,008
You know, Tim, that's
what I like about you.

1333
00:46:51,041 --> 00:46:51,875
You're so up.

1334
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:58,081
You got to go back
and find that babe, Jim.

1335
00:47:01,084 --> 00:47:02,452
Yeah.

1336
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:03,320
Italy.

1337
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:09,226
I got to go back to Italy.

1338
00:47:12,629 --> 00:47:14,498
[wind]

1339
00:47:21,471 --> 00:47:22,573
[sighs]

1340
00:47:22,606 --> 00:47:24,641
JANE DOE: Look,
I want to see how

1341
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:29,246
this guy is going to react when
he has to answer to a face.

1342
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:31,281
Has it ever occurred to
you that some of these men

1343
00:47:31,315 --> 00:47:33,417
might feel protected by the
fact that they can't see us?

1344
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:34,351
Protected?

1345
00:47:34,384 --> 00:47:35,252
No.

1346
00:47:35,285 --> 00:47:36,286
Yes.

1347
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:37,254
I mean, they can hear us.

1348
00:47:37,287 --> 00:47:38,155
They know we're women.

1349
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:40,090
But they can't see us.

1350
00:47:40,123 --> 00:47:42,159
It gives them an out.

1351
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:43,093
My god.

1352
00:47:43,126 --> 00:47:44,695
It's like phone sex.

1353
00:47:44,728 --> 00:47:45,629
No.

1354
00:47:45,662 --> 00:47:47,531
It's not like phone sex.

1355
00:47:47,564 --> 00:47:49,099
Don't you think
that seeing us would

1356
00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:50,634
change the way they answer?

1357
00:47:50,667 --> 00:47:52,936
I mean, don't you think it
would put them more on the spot?

1358
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:54,271
No.

1359
00:47:54,304 --> 00:47:55,138
I think that seeing us
would make them clam up.

1360
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:56,940
No.
I disagree.

1361
00:47:56,974 --> 00:47:58,675
I think a liar is going to lie
no matter who he's talking to.

1362
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:01,979
Look, if you do this I'll have
you thrown off this experiment.

1363
00:48:02,012 --> 00:48:03,046
Why?

1364
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,648
This is my thesis project.

1365
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:06,183
I set the rules.

1366
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:08,018
And quite frankly, I am
happy with the results.

1367
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:10,220
Why do you want to do this?

1368
00:48:10,254 --> 00:48:13,590
Look, this whole
project is experimental.

1369
00:48:13,624 --> 00:48:15,392
I want to try
something different.

1370
00:48:15,425 --> 00:48:17,628
That's the nature
of experimentation.

1371
00:48:17,661 --> 00:48:19,196
Experimentation?

1372
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:20,097
Yes.

1373
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:21,031
Experimentation.

1374
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:21,965
Oh, my.

1375
00:48:21,999 --> 00:48:23,700
You are quite dedicated.

1376
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,402
Aren't you?

1377
00:48:25,435 --> 00:48:27,237
No less than you.

1378
00:48:27,271 --> 00:48:28,171
WOMAN: Really?

1379
00:48:28,205 --> 00:48:29,006
Yes, really.

1380
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:34,578
Look, I've been getting
really weird vibes off you

1381
00:48:34,611 --> 00:48:36,480
since this whole thing started.

1382
00:48:36,513 --> 00:48:38,649
Have you?

1383
00:48:38,682 --> 00:48:40,450
[sighs]

1384
00:48:40,484 --> 00:48:42,219
Is there something
about me that offends you?

1385
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:43,987
I don't know.

1386
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:47,324
Something about the way I dress,
or the way I am as a woman?

1387
00:48:47,357 --> 00:48:52,195
I don't trust your
motives, as a woman.

1388
00:48:52,229 --> 00:48:53,597
What do you mean exactly?

1389
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:56,099
What I mean is I see
no good reason for you

1390
00:48:56,133 --> 00:48:57,534
to show yourself to this guy.

1391
00:48:57,567 --> 00:49:00,103
I think your motives
are personal.

1392
00:49:00,137 --> 00:49:01,004
Personal?

1393
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:01,672
Uh-huh.

1394
00:49:04,341 --> 00:49:06,209
[laughs]

1395
00:49:08,245 --> 00:49:12,215
You think I want
to fuck this guy.

1396
00:49:12,249 --> 00:49:13,150
That's it.

1397
00:49:13,183 --> 00:49:15,619
Isn't it?

1398
00:49:15,652 --> 00:49:19,156
You think I want
to fuck this guy!

1399
00:49:19,189 --> 00:49:20,257
WOMAN: I don't
know what you want.

1400
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:21,792
[laughs]

1401
00:49:21,825 --> 00:49:24,594
Look, you know, I haven't
really thought about it.

1402
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:26,530
I mean, maybe.

1403
00:49:26,563 --> 00:49:29,032
Maybe I do.

1404
00:49:29,066 --> 00:49:31,335
But you know what?

1405
00:49:31,368 --> 00:49:34,338
I get the feeling that
would really bother you.

1406
00:49:34,371 --> 00:49:35,706
You can fuck anybody you like.

1407
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:37,074
I couldn't care less.

1408
00:49:37,107 --> 00:49:37,708
JANE DOE: Really?

1409
00:49:40,344 --> 00:49:41,445
What are your motives?

1410
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:48,385
[dance music]

1411
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:09,806
Hi, Mimi.

1412
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,441
Oh, hi.
Paula, how are you?

1413
00:50:11,475 --> 00:50:12,776
I'm fine.
How are you?

1414
00:50:12,809 --> 00:50:14,544
I'm good.

1415
00:50:14,578 --> 00:50:16,079
What are you doing shopping
in the middle of the afternoon?

1416
00:50:16,113 --> 00:50:17,280
Oh, it's been a long week.

1417
00:50:17,314 --> 00:50:18,648
You know, I thought
I'd spoil myself,

1418
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:20,183
take a Friday afternoon off.

1419
00:50:20,217 --> 00:50:22,285
Oh, good for you.

1420
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:23,487
You're a paralegal, aren't you?

1421
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,322
Well, no.
I used to be.

1422
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:26,823
But I've been a lawyer
for two years now.

1423
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:28,458
That's stupid of me.

1424
00:50:28,492 --> 00:50:30,227
I don't know why I keep
thinking you're a secretary.

1425
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:31,862
What kind of law are you doing?

1426
00:50:31,895 --> 00:50:33,163
Corporate.

1427
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:34,164
Oh, good choice.

1428
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:35,465
Good choice.

1429
00:50:35,499 --> 00:50:36,533
All those wealthy young
investment bankers.

1430
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:37,501
Have you snared one yet?

1431
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:38,402
[laughs]

1432
00:50:38,435 --> 00:50:40,637
I'm sorry.

1433
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:42,139
A husband?

1434
00:50:42,172 --> 00:50:44,241
Oh, don't tell me you're
doing corporate law

1435
00:50:44,274 --> 00:50:45,275
for the challenge.

1436
00:50:45,308 --> 00:50:46,343
Well, actually--

1437
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:47,511
Mimi.

1438
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:48,678
To tell you the
truth, Paula, if I'd

1439
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:50,147
wanted to find a
husband, I would

1440
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:53,183
have become a divorce lawyer.

1441
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:55,852
Right.

1442
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:58,655
Well, I better be going.

1443
00:50:58,688 --> 00:51:00,557
I guess I'll see
you tomorrow night.

1444
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:01,491
Tomorrow night?

1445
00:51:01,525 --> 00:51:02,459
Yeah.

1446
00:51:02,492 --> 00:51:04,394
Jimmy and the boys' party.

1447
00:51:04,428 --> 00:51:05,495
Oh, didn't you know about it?

1448
00:51:05,529 --> 00:51:06,797
Oh, I'm-- yeah.

1449
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:08,298
I just have-- I have
so much on my mind, I

1450
00:51:08,331 --> 00:51:09,633
just completely forgot about it.

1451
00:51:09,666 --> 00:51:11,234
Well, then I guess I'll
see you tomorrow night.

1452
00:51:11,268 --> 00:51:12,135
- OK.
- OK.

1453
00:51:12,169 --> 00:51:12,702
- Bye Paula.
- Bye.

1454
00:51:19,543 --> 00:51:22,412
JANE DOE: Listen, don't hand
me that shit about control.

1455
00:51:22,446 --> 00:51:24,281
I know plenty of women who
complain they aren't getting

1456
00:51:24,314 --> 00:51:25,749
enough sex from their men.

1457
00:51:25,782 --> 00:51:27,417
Well, good.

1458
00:51:27,451 --> 00:51:28,852
I think it's about
time men stood up

1459
00:51:28,885 --> 00:51:30,487
and started denying women sex.

1460
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:31,388
JANE DOE: What?

1461
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:32,856
[laughs]

1462
00:51:32,889 --> 00:51:35,559
You're saying men are
consciously denying women sex?

1463
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:37,194
No.

1464
00:51:37,227 --> 00:51:38,862
I'm saying that they are
unconsciously denying women

1465
00:51:38,895 --> 00:51:41,932
sex, because somewhere
inside they're pissed off

1466
00:51:41,965 --> 00:51:44,267
with women's sexist attitude.

1467
00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:45,602
Women's sexist attitude?

1468
00:51:45,635 --> 00:51:46,503
Yes.

1469
00:51:46,536 --> 00:51:49,372
Women's sexist attitude.

1470
00:51:49,406 --> 00:51:51,808
That a man's sexual
desire is something dirty.

1471
00:51:51,842 --> 00:51:54,611
But despite that, we
should get it up every time

1472
00:51:54,644 --> 00:51:56,546
a woman snaps her fingers.

1473
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:59,416
JANE DOE: Talking
about sexist attitudes.

1474
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:01,918
I mean, what-- what
about the assholes

1475
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:04,454
who expect women to
put out after they've

1476
00:52:04,488 --> 00:52:05,522
bought them dinner?
JIMMY: Yeah.

1477
00:52:05,555 --> 00:52:06,790
But don't you see?

1478
00:52:06,823 --> 00:52:08,558
That's all we ever
hear about are the men.

1479
00:52:08,592 --> 00:52:11,695
Nobody ever talks about
women being sexist.

1480
00:52:11,728 --> 00:52:13,830
Like it's a fucking
crime if you do.

1481
00:52:13,864 --> 00:52:15,565
Wait!

1482
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:18,301
You're making men sound
like victims here.

1483
00:52:18,335 --> 00:52:19,836
No.

1484
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:22,906
I'm just tired of always
hearing men take the blame

1485
00:52:22,939 --> 00:52:24,407
when relationships go bad.

1486
00:52:24,441 --> 00:52:25,375
I mean, I know.

1487
00:52:25,408 --> 00:52:26,510
Jesus.

1488
00:52:26,543 --> 00:52:28,778
I know we've got
a long way to go.

1489
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:31,882
But I just wish that women
would admit that they've

1490
00:52:31,915 --> 00:52:34,251
got some changing to do too.

1491
00:52:34,284 --> 00:52:35,785
Like how?

1492
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:38,989
Like maybe stop complaining
about being helpless victims

1493
00:52:39,022 --> 00:52:39,956
all the time.

1494
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:41,491
Christ, I'm tired of that.

1495
00:52:41,525 --> 00:52:43,393
Listen, violence
against women--

1496
00:52:43,426 --> 00:52:45,228
I don't want to
hear about statistics.

1497
00:52:45,262 --> 00:52:48,765
I mean, do I look like some
kind of violent rapist to you?

1498
00:52:48,798 --> 00:52:51,902
Have I given you any indication
that I would ever hurt you?

1499
00:52:51,935 --> 00:52:55,472
I mean, my god, Jane,
it's just you and me here.

1500
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:59,276
I mean, please, don't come at
me with a bunch of statistics

1501
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:00,744
about sick fuckers.

1502
00:53:00,777 --> 00:53:01,978
That's insulting.

1503
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:02,879
Yes.

1504
00:53:02,913 --> 00:53:04,447
But it's a real problem!

1505
00:53:04,481 --> 00:53:06,750
Well, you don't have
to convince me of it.

1506
00:53:06,783 --> 00:53:08,952
I mean, I know
what men are doing.

1507
00:53:08,985 --> 00:53:10,720
But when you come at me
with stuff like that,

1508
00:53:10,754 --> 00:53:12,556
you make me feel
like I'm one of them.

1509
00:53:12,589 --> 00:53:14,324
And I'm not.

1510
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:16,960
You and I have gotten past the
point where we have to worry

1511
00:53:16,993 --> 00:53:18,528
about each other being psychos.

1512
00:53:18,562 --> 00:53:20,931
Right?

1513
00:53:20,964 --> 00:53:21,865
[huffs]

1514
00:53:21,898 --> 00:53:23,900
Yes.

1515
00:53:23,934 --> 00:53:27,304
So let's just stick
to the main issue

1516
00:53:27,337 --> 00:53:30,340
here, which is a
relationship between two

1517
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:31,741
relatively healthy people.

1518
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:33,677
Not some wackos are
doing out on the street.

1519
00:53:37,347 --> 00:53:39,716
You're right.

1520
00:53:39,749 --> 00:53:42,352
We should keep this
just between two people.

1521
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:45,388
You're absolutely right.

1522
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:53,029
[music playing]

1523
00:54:00,637 --> 00:54:02,739
JIMMY: Well, boys,
here we are again.

1524
00:54:02,772 --> 00:54:04,341
It is party time.

1525
00:54:04,374 --> 00:54:06,076
SEAN: Fucking A.
Let's do some damage.

1526
00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:07,444
Huh?

1527
00:54:07,477 --> 00:54:08,945
Damage?

1528
00:54:08,979 --> 00:54:10,747
Oh, lighten up, Tim.

1529
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:12,616
Are you sure you don't want
to smoke tonight, buddy?

1530
00:54:12,649 --> 00:54:13,984
No.
I don't want to smoke tonight.

1531
00:54:14,017 --> 00:54:15,719
I don't need to smoke tonight.

1532
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:16,820
No.
No.

1533
00:54:16,853 --> 00:54:17,787
More than that.

1534
00:54:17,821 --> 00:54:19,889
I'm not a smoker anymore.

1535
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:22,459
Why don't you wait till
tomorrow to not be a smoker

1536
00:54:22,492 --> 00:54:24,094
anymore, in the name of sanity?

1537
00:54:24,127 --> 00:54:25,695
You're not listening, Jimmy.
You're not listening.

1538
00:54:25,729 --> 00:54:26,696
OK.

1539
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:27,998
OK.

1540
00:54:28,031 --> 00:54:30,834
Well, boys, we are the
hosts with the most.

1541
00:54:30,867 --> 00:54:33,370
And there are women here
tonight to be mosted.

1542
00:54:33,403 --> 00:54:36,339
So good luck, and godspeed.

1543
00:54:36,373 --> 00:54:36,973
Amen.

1544
00:54:41,077 --> 00:54:41,945
Yes.

1545
00:54:41,978 --> 00:54:43,847
[murmuring]

1546
00:54:47,017 --> 00:54:48,418
Simians.

1547
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:49,786
SINGER: (SINGING)
No matter what I do.

1548
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:55,592
I was learning how--

1549
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:57,460
Mind over matter.

1550
00:54:57,494 --> 00:55:00,497
I simply had to think
about how utterly illogical

1551
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:02,065
the act of smoking is.

1552
00:55:02,098 --> 00:55:06,770
I mean, inhaling the smoke from
a dried, burning plant leaf,

1553
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:08,004
it's ridiculous.

1554
00:55:08,038 --> 00:55:09,072
Haven't picked one up since.

1555
00:55:09,105 --> 00:55:10,040
Really?

1556
00:55:10,073 --> 00:55:11,641
When did you quit?

1557
00:55:11,675 --> 00:55:12,575
This afternoon.

1558
00:55:12,609 --> 00:55:13,710
It's a drag really.

1559
00:55:13,743 --> 00:55:14,844
MIMI: Hey, Jimmy, boy.

1560
00:55:14,878 --> 00:55:15,912
Hey.

1561
00:55:15,945 --> 00:55:16,813
It's Mimi.

1562
00:55:16,846 --> 00:55:18,081
Good party, Jim.

1563
00:55:18,114 --> 00:55:19,015
Who's friends are these?

1564
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:19,916
Aha, ha, ha.

1565
00:55:19,949 --> 00:55:21,418
Witty as ever.

1566
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:22,619
Oh, hello.

1567
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:24,521
Mimi Campbell,
this is Ben Calder.

1568
00:55:24,554 --> 00:55:25,989
Hi.

1569
00:55:26,022 --> 00:55:28,391
Ben and I were on the ski
team together in college.

1570
00:55:28,425 --> 00:55:29,759
Oh, I didn't know
you raced, Jimmy.

1571
00:55:29,793 --> 00:55:31,561
Mm.

1572
00:55:31,594 --> 00:55:33,063
So what do you do now, Ben?

1573
00:55:33,096 --> 00:55:34,597
Ben.

1574
00:55:34,631 --> 00:55:35,965
He just finished a two
year stint in Hong Kong.

1575
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:36,966
Uh-huh.

1576
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,401
He's taking the summer off.

1577
00:55:38,435 --> 00:55:40,170
And then he's going
to work in Paris.

1578
00:55:40,203 --> 00:55:41,571
Rough life, huh?
- Wow.

1579
00:55:41,604 --> 00:55:42,739
Jeez.
Is it ever?

1580
00:55:42,772 --> 00:55:44,107
I've always wanted
to live in Paris.

1581
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:45,442
You're very lucky.
[laughter]

1582
00:55:45,475 --> 00:55:50,413
[dance music]

1583
00:55:50,447 --> 00:55:51,815
PAULA: Jimmy!

1584
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:53,416
Ah, heh.

1585
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:55,819
Paula.

1586
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:57,787
Should I be angry at you?

1587
00:55:57,821 --> 00:56:01,191
You know you can't have a
party without inviting me.

1588
00:56:01,224 --> 00:56:02,125
[laughs]

1589
00:56:02,158 --> 00:56:04,627
Well, I forgot.

1590
00:56:04,661 --> 00:56:05,795
Remember Gregory?

1591
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:06,763
Who can forget?

1592
00:56:06,796 --> 00:56:07,797
Hi, Greg.

1593
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:09,099
(SPEAKS WITH ACCENT) Gregory.

1594
00:56:09,132 --> 00:56:10,200
Right.
Gregory.

1595
00:56:10,233 --> 00:56:11,134
Oh, look.
There's Mimi.

1596
00:56:11,167 --> 00:56:12,001
Hi, Mimi!

1597
00:56:15,004 --> 00:56:16,539
Ooh, la, la.

1598
00:56:16,573 --> 00:56:19,008
Who is that?

1599
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:20,744
Ben Calder.

1600
00:56:20,777 --> 00:56:22,145
He's a college friend.

1601
00:56:22,178 --> 00:56:27,150
Oh, he is something.

1602
00:56:27,183 --> 00:56:31,588
Bet you a buck she goes
home with him tonight.

1603
00:56:31,621 --> 00:56:33,456
I hated him.

1604
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:35,825
I can't believe he did this.

1605
00:56:35,859 --> 00:56:36,760
I knew it.

1606
00:56:36,793 --> 00:56:37,794
I knew it.

1607
00:56:37,827 --> 00:56:38,728
God.

1608
00:56:38,762 --> 00:56:40,096

Why'd you sleep with him?

1612
00:56:47,537 --> 00:56:50,507
What do you mean, why
did I sleep with him?

1613
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:53,643
I didn't know I'd hate him.

1614
00:56:53,676 --> 00:56:54,611
Oh.

I'm sorry.

It's nothing personal I was
just trying to squeeze by.

Uh, huh.

unless somebody's hurt you.

having a good time with me.

I'm just not sure they're
having a good time,

Oh, shit, man.

1794
01:05:47,743 --> 01:05:49,578
I gave up worrying about
that a long time ago.

1795
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:51,247
What?

1796
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:54,583
Sean, look, that's all I
used to ever think about.

1797
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:55,685
Was it good for her?

1798
01:05:55,718 --> 01:05:57,320
Did she cum?

1799
01:05:57,353 --> 01:05:59,221
I finally realized
that I was so caught up

1800
01:05:59,255 --> 01:06:01,457
worrying about her
orgasm that I wasn't even

1801
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:04,560
enjoying having sex myself.

1802
01:06:04,593 --> 01:06:06,729
Whoa.

1803
01:06:06,762 --> 01:06:08,531
Yeah.

1804
01:06:08,564 --> 01:06:10,266
And whenever I
asked if it was good,

1805
01:06:10,299 --> 01:06:13,069
well, they'd get
mad at me and tell

1806
01:06:13,102 --> 01:06:14,470
me that I had an ego problem.

1807
01:06:14,503 --> 01:06:17,206
So I figured, hey,
what's the point.

1808
01:06:17,239 --> 01:06:18,140
Yeah.

1809
01:06:18,174 --> 01:06:19,542
I guess.

1810
01:06:19,575 --> 01:06:21,477
Well, like I know they're
enjoying it with me.

1811
01:06:21,510 --> 01:06:22,645
Right?

1812
01:06:22,678 --> 01:06:24,413
I just wonder sometimes.

1813
01:06:24,447 --> 01:06:27,049
Look, I figure if the woman
doesn't have the guts to show

1814
01:06:27,083 --> 01:06:30,653
me what to do, or be responsible
enough to get herself off,

1815
01:06:30,686 --> 01:06:33,322
I figure she doesn't
deserve an orgasm.

1816
01:06:33,356 --> 01:06:34,724
Yeah.

1817
01:06:34,757 --> 01:06:37,126
Maybe.

1818
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:39,061
But you know what I think?

1819
01:06:39,095 --> 01:06:41,597
I think it's all some
big female conspiracy.

1820
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:43,532
What is?

1821
01:06:43,566 --> 01:06:45,634
Women having orgasms.

1822
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:46,469
I think it's a myth.

1823
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:05,388
[blows smoke]

1824
01:07:05,421 --> 01:07:08,257
I'll uh-- see you
in the morning, boys.

1825
01:07:18,267 --> 01:07:21,237
[muttering]

1826
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:22,271
SEAN: Good party.

1827
01:07:25,608 --> 01:07:26,409
JIMMY: Good party.

1828
01:07:29,378 --> 01:07:31,180
TIM: Great party.

1829
01:07:31,213 --> 01:07:33,783
[laughing]

1830
01:07:33,816 --> 01:07:36,852
JIMMY: Great party.

1831
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:38,387
SEAN: Nice babes.

1832
01:07:41,157 --> 01:07:43,459
JIMMY: Nice babes.

1833
01:07:43,492 --> 01:07:45,761
SEAN: Didn't score though.

1834
01:07:45,795 --> 01:07:48,264
JIMMY: Nope.

1835
01:07:48,297 --> 01:07:49,098
Didn't score.

1836
01:07:53,269 --> 01:07:54,370
SEAN: Tim scored.

1837
01:07:54,403 --> 01:07:55,738
[laughs]

1838
01:07:55,771 --> 01:07:59,442
JIMMY: Oh, Tim scored.

1839
01:08:03,946 --> 01:08:06,449
SEAN: Anybody else score?

1840
01:08:06,482 --> 01:08:08,617
JIMMY: I don't know.

1841
01:08:08,651 --> 01:08:12,888
I think Mimi's hot for
Ben Calder, though.

1842
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:14,723
Oh, yeah.

1843
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:16,225
How do you know?

1844
01:08:16,258 --> 01:08:18,461
I just know.

1845
01:08:18,494 --> 01:08:22,698
I've known Mimi long enough
to know when she is in heat.

1846
01:08:22,731 --> 01:08:25,334
And heat is right.

1847
01:08:25,367 --> 01:08:28,804
That guy's going to have
the time of his life.

1848
01:08:28,838 --> 01:08:31,373
What do you mean?

1849
01:08:31,407 --> 01:08:33,609
I mean, the woman is wild.

1850
01:08:33,642 --> 01:08:34,443
Shit.

1851
01:08:38,347 --> 01:08:39,248
Really?

1852
01:08:39,281 --> 01:08:42,318
How do you know?

1853
01:08:42,351 --> 01:08:43,619
SEAN: I fucked her last winter.

1854
01:08:48,224 --> 01:08:48,924
You did?

1855
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:51,427
When?

1856
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:54,930
SEAN: When we all
went on that ski week.

1857
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:55,865
Yeah.

1858
01:08:55,898 --> 01:08:56,799
You weren't there.

1859
01:08:56,832 --> 01:08:59,568
Were you?

1860
01:08:59,602 --> 01:09:01,904
No.

1861
01:09:01,937 --> 01:09:03,672
No.
I had to teach.

1862
01:09:06,275 --> 01:09:06,976
Wow.

1863
01:09:07,009 --> 01:09:08,777
You slept with Mimi.

1864
01:09:08,811 --> 01:09:11,580
SEAN: Oh, yeah.

1865
01:09:11,614 --> 01:09:13,382
She was great.

1866
01:09:13,415 --> 01:09:16,285
She was?

1867
01:09:16,318 --> 01:09:17,186
Awesome.

1868
01:09:20,523 --> 01:09:23,559
Best blowjob I ever had.

1869
01:09:23,592 --> 01:09:24,393
Really?

1870
01:09:27,496 --> 01:09:36,472
SEAN: And she's got the
nicest roundest breasts.

1871
01:09:36,505 --> 01:09:37,373
Huge nipples.

1872
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:41,710
What a body.

1873
01:09:44,747 --> 01:09:45,681
Hm.

1874
01:09:45,714 --> 01:09:48,584
And can she fuck.

1875
01:09:48,617 --> 01:09:49,552
Really?

1876
01:09:49,585 --> 01:09:50,386
SEAN: Oh yeah.

1877
01:09:52,888 --> 01:09:55,257
She was awesome.

1878
01:09:55,291 --> 01:09:56,559
[laughs]

1879
01:09:56,592 --> 01:09:57,660
Shit.

1880
01:09:57,693 --> 01:09:59,328
That guy's going to get cranked.

1881
01:10:02,698 --> 01:10:03,499
Really?

1882
01:10:18,447 --> 01:10:19,715
[glass shatters]

1883
01:10:24,453 --> 01:10:25,287
Fuck.

1884
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:38,033
Look, that'll be it
for today, folks.

1885
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:39,501
I'll see you all on Thursday.

1886
01:10:59,888 --> 01:11:02,825
There's something
I want to show you.

1887
01:11:02,858 --> 01:11:03,792
I beg your pardon?

1888
01:11:03,826 --> 01:11:05,361
[laughs]

1889
01:11:05,394 --> 01:11:07,563
I said, there's something
I want to show you.

1890
01:11:07,596 --> 01:11:08,497
Oh, really.

1891
01:11:08,530 --> 01:11:12,901
Uh, what's that?

1892
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:15,504
Me.

1893
01:11:15,537 --> 01:11:16,605
You?

1894
01:11:16,639 --> 01:11:17,506
Yeah.

1895
01:11:17,539 --> 01:11:19,441
Me.

1896
01:11:19,475 --> 01:11:22,344
You-- you were right.

1897
01:11:22,378 --> 01:11:24,380
We should keep this
just between two people.

1898
01:11:27,816 --> 01:11:31,086
[laughs]

1899
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:32,855
You're Jane Doe.

1900
01:11:32,888 --> 01:11:35,057
Yeah.

1901
01:11:35,090 --> 01:11:36,525
Wow.

1902
01:11:36,558 --> 01:11:37,693
I thought we were
never supposed to see.

1903
01:11:37,726 --> 01:11:39,395
Oh, well, you aren't.

1904
01:11:39,428 --> 01:11:40,462
But I'm changing the rules.

1905
01:11:40,496 --> 01:11:41,397
You are?

1906
01:11:41,430 --> 01:11:42,464
Why?

1907
01:11:42,498 --> 01:11:44,066
Because I don't
agree with them.

1908
01:11:46,869 --> 01:11:48,871
You were at the party
on Saturday night.

1909
01:11:48,904 --> 01:11:50,472
JANE DOE: Yep.

1910
01:11:50,506 --> 01:11:51,874
And I'm probably going to
get in a lot of trouble

1911
01:11:51,907 --> 01:11:53,409
for doing this.

1912
01:11:53,442 --> 01:11:54,643
Oh, they may even kick
me off the experiment.

1913
01:11:54,677 --> 01:11:56,645
JIMMY: Oh, but you
spent all this time.

1914
01:11:56,679 --> 01:11:57,980
Oh, that's OK.

1915
01:11:58,013 --> 01:12:00,149
I mean, you know, I've
learned a few things.

1916
01:12:00,182 --> 01:12:01,483
I'll start my own project.

1917
01:12:01,517 --> 01:12:03,419
[laughs]

1918
01:12:03,452 --> 01:12:04,553
JANE DOE: You seem
uncomfortable.

1919
01:12:04,586 --> 01:12:05,788
Is there something wrong?
- No.

1920
01:12:05,821 --> 01:12:06,722
No.

1921
01:12:06,755 --> 01:12:08,457
It's-- no.

1922
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:10,993
It's just, you know, strange
seeing you all of a sudden.

1923
01:12:11,026 --> 01:12:14,463
Well, I had a picture,
you know, in my mind.

1924
01:12:14,496 --> 01:12:15,964
- Disappointed.
- No.

1925
01:12:15,998 --> 01:12:16,932
No.

1926
01:12:16,965 --> 01:12:19,068
I mean, it's-- it's good.

1927
01:12:19,101 --> 01:12:20,469
I mean, it's good
to see you, finally.

1928
01:12:20,502 --> 01:12:24,139
[laughs nervously]

1929
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:26,942
You know, I have--

1930
01:12:26,975 --> 01:12:30,179
I've really never met
a man like you before.

1931
01:12:30,212 --> 01:12:31,714
What do you mean?

1932
01:12:31,747 --> 01:12:35,584
Well, for someone as
physically attractive

1933
01:12:35,617 --> 01:12:38,487
as you are, it's
rare to find someone

1934
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:43,525
so intellectually elegant.

1935
01:12:43,559 --> 01:12:45,828
My.

1936
01:12:45,861 --> 01:12:47,029
Thank you.
- Really.

1937
01:12:47,062 --> 01:12:48,063
I mean it.

1938
01:12:48,097 --> 01:12:50,199
I mean, you're really different.

1939
01:12:50,232 --> 01:12:53,535
You know, you're not afraid
to show your weaknesses.

1940
01:12:53,569 --> 01:12:55,671
You seem to almost
celebrate them.

1941
01:12:55,704 --> 01:12:58,807
Well, I don't see any
reason to hide them.

1942
01:12:58,841 --> 01:13:00,709
JANE DOE: And that's
what I like about you.

1943
01:13:00,743 --> 01:13:03,045
Humility and looks.

1944
01:13:03,078 --> 01:13:05,581
That's rare.

1945
01:13:05,614 --> 01:13:09,818
And you're really,
really good at it too.

1946
01:13:09,852 --> 01:13:11,220
Hm?

1947
01:13:11,253 --> 01:13:14,656
JANE DOE: Well, I'll bet
tons of women fall for it.

1948
01:13:14,690 --> 01:13:16,658
Fall for what?

1949
01:13:16,692 --> 01:13:18,694
Well, your con.

1950
01:13:18,727 --> 01:13:19,995
What con?

1951
01:13:20,028 --> 01:13:21,864
Your looks, your
elegance, your humility,

1952
01:13:21,897 --> 01:13:25,100
and, ungh, I can tell you,
it really is a turn on.

1953
01:13:25,134 --> 01:13:26,068
It's not a con.

1954
01:13:26,101 --> 01:13:27,836
JANE DOE: Yeah.

1955
01:13:27,870 --> 01:13:29,872
Jimmy, it's so good a con, you
don't even know it's a con.

1956
01:13:29,905 --> 01:13:31,540
But it's not a con.

1957
01:13:31,573 --> 01:13:32,641
Everybody's got a con.

1958
01:13:32,674 --> 01:13:33,575
I've got a con.

1959
01:13:33,609 --> 01:13:34,843
You've got a con.

1960
01:13:34,877 --> 01:13:36,612
We've all got a con
to get what we want.

1961
01:13:36,645 --> 01:13:39,982
And yours, it is-- mhm-- it's
really different, you know.

1962
01:13:40,015 --> 01:13:42,584
But it's all camouflage.

1963
01:13:42,618 --> 01:13:43,919
You think you're better
than most people.

1964
01:13:43,952 --> 01:13:45,621
[laughs]
- No, I don't.

1965
01:13:45,654 --> 01:13:47,156
Yeah, you do.

1966
01:13:47,189 --> 01:13:49,158
You're a bit of an
arrogant, self-righteous

1967
01:13:49,191 --> 01:13:50,759
son of a bitch, James Rovinski.

1968
01:13:50,793 --> 01:13:52,528
And I think you hide it
behind a wall of humility.

1969
01:13:52,561 --> 01:13:53,262
Really?

1970
01:13:53,295 --> 01:13:54,730
Really?

1971
01:13:54,763 --> 01:13:56,565
And I think that you
are really offended

1972
01:13:56,598 --> 01:14:00,068
when a woman isn't attracted
to you, offended to your core.

1973
01:14:00,102 --> 01:14:02,704
Look, I think I have
learned to live with the fact

1974
01:14:02,738 --> 01:14:04,072
that not every woman
is attracted to me.

1975
01:14:04,106 --> 01:14:05,240
Yeah.

1976
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:06,141
Well, you may learn
to live with it.

1977
01:14:06,175 --> 01:14:06,975
But you don't accept it.

1978
01:14:07,009 --> 01:14:09,244
That's not true.

1979
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:11,513
You never get the
women you want, Jimmy.

1980
01:14:11,547 --> 01:14:13,549
I mean, it seems to me, you're
attracted to intelligent women.

1981
01:14:13,582 --> 01:14:15,884
But somehow, they always
get away from you.

1982
01:14:15,918 --> 01:14:16,785
So?

1983
01:14:16,819 --> 01:14:19,655
So-- so maybe--

1984
01:14:19,688 --> 01:14:22,090
maybe they sense you're
looking down on them.

1985
01:14:22,124 --> 01:14:26,695
I mean, they can't explain it
because you hide it so well.

1986
01:14:26,728 --> 01:14:28,063
But they feel it.

1987
01:14:28,096 --> 01:14:29,565
And it turns them off.

1988
01:14:29,598 --> 01:14:32,868
Look, what are you--

1989
01:14:32,901 --> 01:14:34,870
you don't have the slightest
idea what you're talking about.

1990
01:14:34,903 --> 01:14:38,974
JANE DOE: Oh, really?

1991
01:14:39,007 --> 01:14:42,077
Think about it, Rovinski.

1992
01:14:42,110 --> 01:14:42,911
Just think about it.

1993
01:14:52,354 --> 01:14:55,257
[phone ringing]

1994
01:15:00,829 --> 01:15:01,697
JIMMY: Hi.

1995
01:15:01,730 --> 01:15:03,298
Thanks for calling.

1996
01:15:03,332 --> 01:15:06,068
Please leave a message for Sean,
Tim, or Jimmy after the beep.

1997
01:15:06,101 --> 01:15:07,002
Thanks for calling.

1998
01:15:07,035 --> 01:15:08,337
Bye.

1999
01:15:08,370 --> 01:15:10,005
MIMI (ON PHONE): Hey, Jim.

2000
01:15:10,038 --> 01:15:11,139
It's Mimi.

2001
01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:12,741
I'm just calling
to make sure we're

2002
01:15:12,774 --> 01:15:14,009
on for dinner tomorrow night.

2003
01:15:14,042 --> 01:15:14,910
Give me a call back.

2004
01:15:14,943 --> 01:15:16,678
Bye.

2005
01:15:16,712 --> 01:15:23,919
SINGER: (SINGING) Every time
she break if you relay every--

2006
01:15:23,952 --> 01:15:26,922
[phone ringing]

2007
01:15:26,955 --> 01:15:29,324
JIMMY (ON PHONE): Hello.

2008
01:15:29,358 --> 01:15:30,325
PAULA: Hello, James, dear.

2009
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:32,628
Did I wake you up?

2010
01:15:32,661 --> 01:15:33,595
JIMMY (ON PHONE): Yes.

2011
01:15:33,629 --> 01:15:34,663
Well, it's late morning.

2012
01:15:34,696 --> 01:15:36,164
You should be getting up anyway.

2013
01:15:36,198 --> 01:15:38,634
Listen, I was just calling
to thank you about the party

2014
01:15:38,667 --> 01:15:39,368
Saturday night.

2015
01:15:39,401 --> 01:15:40,702
I really appreciate it.

2016
01:15:40,736 --> 01:15:41,336
JIMMY (ON PHONE): Paula--

2017
01:15:44,072 --> 01:15:48,644
Paula, you know how when
you go to bed at night

2018
01:15:48,677 --> 01:15:51,113
and you're not really
sure about something,

2019
01:15:51,146 --> 01:15:52,648
and then you wake
up in the morning

2020
01:15:52,681 --> 01:15:53,715
and suddenly you're sure?

2021
01:15:53,749 --> 01:15:54,583
Yes.

2022
01:15:57,252 --> 01:15:59,788
Well, I'm sure I don't
want you calling me anymore.

2023
01:15:59,821 --> 01:16:00,722
[laughs]

2024
01:16:00,756 --> 01:16:02,291
I beg your pardon.

2025
01:16:02,324 --> 01:16:05,060
I'm also sure that
I don't want to go

2026
01:16:05,093 --> 01:16:07,162
out to dinner with you anymore.

2027
01:16:07,195 --> 01:16:08,830
What?

2028
01:16:08,864 --> 01:16:11,800
As a matter of
fact, I'm sure I don't

2029
01:16:11,833 --> 01:16:14,002
ever want to see you again.

2030
01:16:14,036 --> 01:16:14,970
Jimmy.

2031
01:16:15,003 --> 01:16:16,138
Don't bother me any more.

2032
01:16:16,171 --> 01:16:17,072
OK.

2033
01:16:17,105 --> 01:16:17,906
Please?

2034
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:23,145
Bye Paula.

2035
01:16:23,178 --> 01:16:26,648
(SINGING) All black nature.

2036
01:16:39,061 --> 01:16:40,162
Oh, hey Jim.

2037
01:16:40,195 --> 01:16:41,096
How you doing?

2038
01:16:41,129 --> 01:16:42,097
JIMMY: Hey, Sean.

2039
01:16:42,130 --> 01:16:43,332
Where are you off to?

2040
01:16:43,365 --> 01:16:45,133
JIMMY: I'm going to
Mimi's for dinner.

2041
01:16:45,167 --> 01:16:47,803
Oh.

2042
01:16:47,836 --> 01:16:52,774
Listen, Jimmy, it occurred
to me that maybe I

2043
01:16:52,808 --> 01:16:57,813
shouldn't have told you anything
about what happened between me

2044
01:16:57,846 --> 01:16:59,247
and Mimi.

2045
01:16:59,281 --> 01:17:01,316
You know, I was kind of
hammered on Saturday night.

2046
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:05,220
And I just kind of forgot
how you feel about her.

2047
01:17:05,253 --> 01:17:06,355
Yeah.

2048
01:17:06,388 --> 01:17:08,056
Well, did you just
kind of forget

2049
01:17:08,090 --> 01:17:10,225
while you were fucking her too?

2050
01:17:10,258 --> 01:17:11,326
Come on, Jim.

2051
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:13,395
I'm trying to apologize here.

2052
01:17:13,428 --> 01:17:15,464
JIMMY: Really?

2053
01:17:15,497 --> 01:17:18,100
Well, don't sweat it, Seany boy.

2054
01:17:18,133 --> 01:17:20,435
Maybe someday I'll
sleep with somebody

2055
01:17:20,469 --> 01:17:22,804
you're in love with if you
ever fall in love with anybody.

2056
01:17:22,838 --> 01:17:24,206
Yeah.

2057
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:26,808
Well, just so you know, it
was one of those things.

2058
01:17:26,842 --> 01:17:27,876
We were drunk.

2059
01:17:27,909 --> 01:17:30,278
And it just happened.

2060
01:17:30,312 --> 01:17:31,313
It didn't mean anything.

2061
01:17:31,346 --> 01:17:32,414
Great.

2062
01:17:32,447 --> 01:17:33,348
It didn't mean anything.

2063
01:17:33,382 --> 01:17:35,484
Well, that's just great.

2064
01:17:35,517 --> 01:17:37,285
You know, I think that's
what bothers me the most.

2065
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:47,062
Fuck.

2066
01:17:47,095 --> 01:17:48,163
Oh, come on.

2067
01:17:48,196 --> 01:17:50,065
You have more friends than this.

2068
01:17:50,098 --> 01:17:51,333
Yeah.

2069
01:17:51,366 --> 01:17:53,301
But these are the ones I like.

2070
01:17:53,335 --> 01:17:54,269
[laughing]

2071
01:17:54,302 --> 01:17:55,737
MIMI: No, really.

2072
01:17:55,771 --> 01:17:59,007
I want to have a big,
big party for you.

2073
01:17:59,041 --> 01:18:01,143
Honestly, I can't
think of anybody else.

2074
01:18:01,176 --> 01:18:03,845
Do you want to invite Paula?

2075
01:18:03,879 --> 01:18:04,813
What do you think?

2076
01:18:04,846 --> 01:18:05,514
I don't know.

2077
01:18:05,547 --> 01:18:06,748
No.

2078
01:18:06,782 --> 01:18:09,418
I do not want to invite Paula.

2079
01:18:09,451 --> 01:18:12,854
MIMI: Oh, I know.

2080
01:18:12,888 --> 01:18:13,955
How about Ben?

2081
01:18:13,989 --> 01:18:14,790
JIMMY: Ben?

2082
01:18:18,794 --> 01:18:19,528
You mean Ben Calder.

2083
01:18:19,561 --> 01:18:20,429
Yeah.

2084
01:18:20,462 --> 01:18:23,098
How about him?

2085
01:18:23,131 --> 01:18:24,866
Oh, Ben.

2086
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:29,971
Well, Ben and I aren't, you
know, really that good friends.

2087
01:18:30,005 --> 01:18:31,239
Yeah.

2088
01:18:31,273 --> 01:18:32,874
Well, why don't we
just invite him anyway?

2089
01:18:32,908 --> 01:18:35,077
Yeah.

2090
01:18:35,110 --> 01:18:36,378
I guess so.

2091
01:18:36,411 --> 01:18:37,279
OK.

2092
01:18:37,312 --> 01:18:42,417
Ben and his girlfriend.

2093
01:18:42,451 --> 01:18:43,785
- He's got a girlfriend?
- Yeah.

2094
01:18:43,819 --> 01:18:44,519
Yeah.

2095
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:45,821
He's got a girlfriend.

2096
01:18:45,854 --> 01:18:46,788
Oh.

2097
01:18:46,822 --> 01:18:48,356
What a bummer?

2098
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:50,559
He is such a cutey.

2099
01:18:50,592 --> 01:18:54,062
[laughs]

2100
01:18:54,096 --> 01:18:55,997
What's wrong?

2101
01:18:56,031 --> 01:18:57,933
Mimi, why do you want
to have this party?

2102
01:18:57,966 --> 01:18:59,301
What?

2103
01:18:59,334 --> 01:19:00,569
The party.

2104
01:19:00,602 --> 01:19:01,937
Why do you want to
have this party for me?

2105
01:19:01,970 --> 01:19:03,839
Because you're my friend.

2106
01:19:03,872 --> 01:19:05,173
And it's your birthday.

2107
01:19:05,207 --> 01:19:06,374
And I thought it would
be a nice thing to do.

2108
01:19:06,408 --> 01:19:07,509
JIMMY: That's the only reason?
- Yeah.

2109
01:19:07,542 --> 01:19:08,877
JIMMY: Really?

2110
01:19:08,910 --> 01:19:10,579
Well, what are you getting at?

2111
01:19:10,612 --> 01:19:12,814
JIMMY: There is no other reason?

2112
01:19:12,848 --> 01:19:14,316
Like what?

2113
01:19:14,349 --> 01:19:18,019
Like maybe you're interested
in one of my friends.

2114
01:19:18,053 --> 01:19:20,288
And if he was at the party,
that would be the perfect chance

2115
01:19:20,322 --> 01:19:21,323
to get at him.

2116
01:19:21,356 --> 01:19:22,424
Is that what you think?

2117
01:19:22,457 --> 01:19:23,291
JIMMY: I don't know.

2118
01:19:26,294 --> 01:19:27,529
Yes.

2119
01:19:27,562 --> 01:19:28,463
Yes.

2120
01:19:28,497 --> 01:19:29,531
That is what I think.

2121
01:19:29,564 --> 01:19:30,432
Should I?

2122
01:19:30,465 --> 01:19:31,967
What do you think I am?

2123
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,869
I don't know, Mimi.

2124
01:19:33,902 --> 01:19:35,904
But why don't you just tell me
when you're interested in one

2125
01:19:35,937 --> 01:19:37,372
of my friends.

2126
01:19:37,405 --> 01:19:39,441
Why don't you just say,
Jimmy, I find Ben attractive.

2127
01:19:39,474 --> 01:19:41,042
Will you set me up?

2128
01:19:41,076 --> 01:19:42,043
I didn't know.

2129
01:19:42,077 --> 01:19:45,013
It just doesn't feel right.

2130
01:19:45,046 --> 01:19:46,047
JIMMY: Yeah.

2131
01:19:46,081 --> 01:19:47,549
And why doesn't it feel right?

2132
01:19:47,582 --> 01:19:48,483
I don't know.

2133
01:19:48,517 --> 01:19:51,553
Well, I'll tell you why.

2134
01:19:51,586 --> 01:19:53,455
Because we're not friends.

2135
01:19:53,488 --> 01:19:56,358
MIMI: What are
you talking about?

2136
01:19:56,391 --> 01:19:58,260
If we were
friends, you wouldn't

2137
01:19:58,293 --> 01:20:00,395
have any trouble telling me
who you're interested in.

2138
01:20:00,428 --> 01:20:01,630
No.
That's not true.

2139
01:20:01,663 --> 01:20:03,265
I always tell you
about my boyfriends.

2140
01:20:03,298 --> 01:20:04,299
Yeah.

2141
01:20:04,332 --> 01:20:05,534
When you're going out with them.

2142
01:20:05,567 --> 01:20:06,568
But whenever we're
single we never talk

2143
01:20:06,601 --> 01:20:07,502
about who we're interested in.

2144
01:20:07,536 --> 01:20:08,937
What is wrong with you?

2145
01:20:08,970 --> 01:20:09,638
That's just bullshit.

2146
01:20:09,671 --> 01:20:11,907
JIMMY: Oh, is it?

2147
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:13,542
Then why didn't you tell
me that you fucked Sean?

2148
01:20:17,212 --> 01:20:18,346
He told you.
JIMMY: Yes.

2149
01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:19,381
He told me.

2150
01:20:19,414 --> 01:20:20,549
What'd you expect?

2151
01:20:20,582 --> 01:20:21,983
The schmuck is only
my best friend.

2152
01:20:22,017 --> 01:20:24,386
Oh, that son of a bitch.

2153
01:20:24,419 --> 01:20:26,321
Well, if we're such
good friends then

2154
01:20:26,354 --> 01:20:27,589
why didn't you tell me?

2155
01:20:27,622 --> 01:20:30,058
Because I--

2156
01:20:30,091 --> 01:20:32,160
I'll tell you why.

2157
01:20:32,194 --> 01:20:33,562
For the same reason that
you couldn't tell me

2158
01:20:33,595 --> 01:20:34,963
that you're interested in Ben.

2159
01:20:34,996 --> 01:20:35,664
Because you couldn't.

2160
01:20:35,697 --> 01:20:36,631
No.

2161
01:20:36,665 --> 01:20:37,566
I didn't want to hurt you.

2162
01:20:37,599 --> 01:20:39,301
[laughs]

2163
01:20:39,334 --> 01:20:41,169
And you think doing it this
way isn't going to hurt me?

2164
01:20:41,203 --> 01:20:43,238
Having a party for me?

2165
01:20:43,271 --> 01:20:44,673
How fucking ignorant
do you think I am?

2166
01:20:44,706 --> 01:20:46,408
I'm not blind.

2167
01:20:46,441 --> 01:20:48,210
Do you think I wouldn't be
hurt if you started seeing him?

2168
01:20:48,243 --> 01:20:49,544
Oh, what difference
does it make.

2169
01:20:49,578 --> 01:20:50,946
Nothing's going to happen now.

2170
01:20:50,979 --> 01:20:52,113
He's got a girlfriend.

2171
01:20:52,147 --> 01:20:54,916
No, he doesn't.

2172
01:20:54,950 --> 01:20:57,619
I just told you that
to see how you'd react.

2173
01:20:57,652 --> 01:20:59,588
You bastard.

2174
01:20:59,621 --> 01:21:03,291
Yeah, well, at
least now I know.

2175
01:21:03,325 --> 01:21:05,227
How many others didn't
you tell me about?

2176
01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:06,494
Oh, you know what?

2177
01:21:06,528 --> 01:21:08,230
I can't believe this.

2178
01:21:08,263 --> 01:21:10,532
What gives you the right to
say this kind of shit to me?

2179
01:21:10,565 --> 01:21:11,666
We're friends, Jimmy.

2180
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:13,068
That doesn't mean
you can tell me

2181
01:21:13,101 --> 01:21:14,302
who I should be sleeping with.
- OK.

2182
01:21:14,336 --> 01:21:15,570
Fine.

2183
01:21:15,604 --> 01:21:18,340
And what a sexist
asshole you're being.

2184
01:21:18,373 --> 01:21:20,408
I don't hear you talking to
your guy friends like this.

2185
01:21:20,442 --> 01:21:22,143
Sean sleeps with
whoever he wants to.

2186
01:21:22,177 --> 01:21:23,445
Why don't you bitch at him too?

2187
01:21:23,478 --> 01:21:25,313
Because I am not
in love with Sean.

2188
01:21:30,552 --> 01:21:32,487
MIMI: Jimmy, you and
I are just friends.

2189
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:34,256
If you can't handle that,
that's your problem.

2190
01:21:37,158 --> 01:21:38,593
You're right, Mimi.

2191
01:21:38,627 --> 01:21:39,494
Yeah.

2192
01:21:39,527 --> 01:21:41,730
It is my problem.

2193
01:21:41,763 --> 01:21:43,531
For five years it's
been my problem.

2194
01:21:43,565 --> 01:21:45,967
For five years I have watched
you go out with other people.

2195
01:21:46,001 --> 01:21:48,103
And you know what?

2196
01:21:48,136 --> 01:21:50,305
I'm sick of it.

2197
01:21:50,338 --> 01:21:53,642
And I'm sick of pretending
to be your friend.

2198
01:21:53,675 --> 01:21:56,111
I'm sick of having to keep my
distance when all I want to do

2199
01:21:56,144 --> 01:22:00,715
is just grab you.

2200
01:22:00,749 --> 01:22:03,652
We're not friends, Mimi.

2201
01:22:03,685 --> 01:22:06,588
And we never have been because
of the way I feel about you.

2202
01:22:09,557 --> 01:22:11,092
We are just friends.

2203
01:22:11,126 --> 01:22:12,727
And you're going to
have to get used to it.

2204
01:22:12,761 --> 01:22:14,362
No.

2205
01:22:14,396 --> 01:22:15,297
I've tried, Mimi.

2206
01:22:15,330 --> 01:22:18,466
I really have.

2207
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:24,339
And we should be
friends, but I can't.

2208
01:22:24,372 --> 01:22:25,473
And I'm ashamed I can't.

2209
01:22:25,507 --> 01:22:28,710
And I'm tired of
feeling ashamed.

2210
01:22:28,743 --> 01:22:33,581
I'm tired of feeling hurt, and
jealous, and not good enough.

2211
01:22:33,615 --> 01:22:36,384
I'm tired of trying
to be your friend.

2212
01:22:36,418 --> 01:22:38,153
For five years,
Mimi, I have tried.

2213
01:22:38,186 --> 01:22:40,755
And I can't.

2214
01:22:40,789 --> 01:22:44,392
I really can't anymore.

2215
01:22:44,426 --> 01:22:46,194
So what are you saying?

2216
01:22:50,332 --> 01:22:52,267
I don't think we should
see each other anymore, Mimi.

2217
01:22:55,236 --> 01:22:56,304
I don't think we can be friends.

2218
01:23:15,457 --> 01:23:20,328
I did something I don't
think anybody's ever done.

2219
01:23:20,362 --> 01:23:22,664
I broke up with two people.

2220
01:23:22,697 --> 01:23:24,599
And I wasn't going out
with either of them.

2221
01:23:24,632 --> 01:23:26,568
Oh, Christ.

2222
01:23:26,601 --> 01:23:29,170
That's got to be a first.

2223
01:23:29,204 --> 01:23:32,407
JANE DOE: So if you ever do
find that one special woman,

2224
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:33,708
what will she be like?

2225
01:23:33,742 --> 01:23:35,343
Rich.

2226
01:23:35,377 --> 01:23:36,544
Rich?

2227
01:23:36,578 --> 01:23:37,512
What?

2228
01:23:37,545 --> 01:23:38,480
You want to be a kept man?

2229
01:23:38,513 --> 01:23:39,381
Oh, yeah.

2230
01:23:39,414 --> 01:23:41,649
Well, it'd be nice.

2231
01:23:41,683 --> 01:23:43,385
I just don't want to have
anybody depending on me.

2232
01:23:43,418 --> 01:23:45,120
You know?

2233
01:23:45,153 --> 01:23:48,490
I have a hard enough time
being responsible for myself.

2234
01:23:48,523 --> 01:23:49,357
What else?

2235
01:23:52,761 --> 01:23:55,797
I guess I just want somebody
that can see my side of things

2236
01:23:55,830 --> 01:23:56,698
too.

2237
01:23:56,731 --> 01:23:58,199
You know?

2238
01:23:58,233 --> 01:24:00,635
Understanding.

2239
01:24:00,668 --> 01:24:01,536
Yeah.

2240
01:24:01,569 --> 01:24:03,371
I know it sounds sappy.

2241
01:24:03,405 --> 01:24:04,339
But yeah.

2242
01:24:04,372 --> 01:24:05,707
And uh-- rich.

2243
01:24:05,740 --> 01:24:07,175
Yeah.

2244
01:24:07,208 --> 01:24:11,446
Understanding and rich
with a great body.

2245
01:24:11,479 --> 01:24:13,648
[laughing]

2246
01:24:13,681 --> 01:24:15,683
You're a schmuck, Rovinski.

2247
01:24:31,399 --> 01:24:33,334
Uh, wait.

2248
01:24:33,368 --> 01:24:36,704
I've got something for you here.

2249
01:24:36,738 --> 01:24:38,640
[laughs]

2250
01:24:38,673 --> 01:24:40,475
Oh, well, thanks.

2251
01:24:40,508 --> 01:24:42,677
But they kicked me
off the project.

2252
01:24:42,710 --> 01:24:45,280
Oh, well, I'm
sorry to hear it.

2253
01:24:45,313 --> 01:24:49,384
Well, like I said, I'll
start my own project.

2254
01:24:49,417 --> 01:24:54,322
Well, keep it for
old time's sake then.

2255
01:24:54,355 --> 01:24:55,256
OK.

2256
01:24:55,290 --> 01:24:57,192
For old time's sake.

2257
01:24:57,225 --> 01:25:00,795
And if you ever need
another guinea pig.

2258
01:25:00,829 --> 01:25:02,263
Well, thanks.

2259
01:25:02,297 --> 01:25:05,700
I might just take
you up on that offer.

2260
01:25:05,733 --> 01:25:07,936
Well, thank you.

2261
01:25:07,969 --> 01:25:12,173
It's been interesting.

2262
01:25:12,207 --> 01:25:14,175
JIMMY: Interesting.
Ouch.

2263
01:25:14,209 --> 01:25:16,211
[laughs]

2264
01:25:16,244 --> 01:25:20,882
Well, I've got to get going.

2265
01:25:20,915 --> 01:25:23,585
Maybe we'll see you around
the department someday.

2266
01:25:23,618 --> 01:25:25,954
Yeah.
I guess.

2267
01:25:25,987 --> 01:25:29,190
Well, farewell, Jane Doe.

2268
01:25:29,224 --> 01:25:30,692
Farewell, James Rovinski.

2269
01:25:35,463 --> 01:25:37,732
By the way, my name's Jo.

2270
01:25:37,765 --> 01:25:38,833
JIMMY: I'm sorry.

2271
01:25:38,867 --> 01:25:39,801
My name.

2272
01:25:39,834 --> 01:25:42,637
It's Jo, short for Joanne.

2273
01:25:42,670 --> 01:25:44,572
Nice to meet you
Jo, short for Joanne.

2274
01:25:48,309 --> 01:25:48,910
Bye.

2275
01:25:55,517 --> 01:25:56,317
Hey Rovinski!

2276
01:26:01,589 --> 01:26:05,393
Listen, I know this is going
to sound weird after everything

2277
01:26:05,426 --> 01:26:08,897
we've been through,
but would you

2278
01:26:08,930 --> 01:26:12,700
have dinner with me some time?

2279
01:26:12,734 --> 01:26:14,469
Dinner?

2280
01:26:14,502 --> 01:26:15,370
Yeah.

2281
01:26:15,403 --> 01:26:17,238
Dinner.

2282
01:26:17,272 --> 01:26:18,973
You mean like a date?

2283
01:26:19,007 --> 01:26:19,874
Yeah.

2284
01:26:19,908 --> 01:26:20,808
A date.

2285
01:26:20,842 --> 01:26:23,511
[laughs]

2286
01:26:23,545 --> 01:26:24,746
I can't believe
you're laughing at me.

2287
01:26:24,779 --> 01:26:26,881
No.
No.

2288
01:26:26,915 --> 01:26:27,849
No.
I'm not laughing at you.

2289
01:26:27,882 --> 01:26:32,921
I'm-- I'm flattered.

2290
01:26:32,954 --> 01:26:36,391
Flattered?

2291
01:26:36,424 --> 01:26:38,526
I thought you'd never ask.

2292
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:39,894
[MUSIC - BRAD HAYES, "SAY THOSE
 THINGS"]

2293
01:26:39,928 --> 01:26:43,531
(SINGING) Words you
told me not too long ago.

2294
01:26:43,565 --> 01:26:47,635
If you love me,
better tell me so.

2295
01:26:47,669 --> 01:26:51,306
Say those things on your mind.

2296
01:26:55,410 --> 01:26:58,980
What you're saying
is in between.

2297
01:26:59,013 --> 01:27:02,750
I wish you'd tell me
just what you mean.

2298
01:27:02,784 --> 01:27:06,521
You've got to say those
things on your mind.

2299
01:27:11,526 --> 01:27:14,295
It's not the truth,
but it's not a lie

2300
01:27:14,329 --> 01:27:19,400
when you can't say the
things that you feel inside.

2301
01:27:19,434 --> 01:27:22,337
Feel like you're walking
on a moving track.

2302
01:27:22,370 --> 01:27:25,473
You take one step forward,
and one step back.

2303
01:27:30,445 --> 01:27:34,415
Words you told me
not too long ago.

2304
01:27:34,449 --> 01:27:38,319
If you love me,
better tell me so.

2305
01:27:38,353 --> 01:27:42,590
Say those things on your mind.

2306
01:27:46,494 --> 01:27:49,664
What's you're saying
is in between.

2307
01:27:49,697 --> 01:27:53,434
I wish you'd tell me
just what you mean.

2308

You've got to say those

2309

It's not the truth,

Feel like you're walking

2312
01:28:12,487 --> 01:28:15,723
You take one step forward,
and one step back.

2313
01:28:20,728 --> 01:28:24,832
What you say is
all well and fine.

2314
01:28:24,866 --> 01:28:27,935
But what I'm missing
is the bottom line.

2315
01:28:27,969 --> 01:28:32,840
You got to say those things
that are on your mind.

2316
01:29:07,942 --> 01:29:10,411
It's not the truth,

What you see is
not what you get.

2321
01:29:31,165 --> 01:29:33,935
What's underneath just
ain't come out yet.

2322
01:29:33,968 --> 01:29:38,473
You got to say those
things on your mind.

2323
01:29:41,809 --> 01:29:43,111
Go on and say those things.

2324
