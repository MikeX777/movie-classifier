1
00:00:11,467 --> 00:00:16,162
IN THE NAME OF THE LAW

2
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:40,347
This land, this lonely place left to
crack in the sun is Sicily...

3
00:01:40,397 --> 00:01:43,946
... a place made up not only of the pleasant
orange gardens, olives and flowers...

4
00:01:43,997 --> 00:01:46,465
... that you know of,
or think you know of...

5
00:01:46,517 --> 00:01:48,712
... but also of burnt and naked fields...

6
00:01:48,757 --> 00:01:51,225
... brick walls of blinding white...

7
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:55,475
... men steeped in ancient customs
that outsiders will never comprehend.

8
00:01:55,517 --> 00:01:59,396
A world that is both mysterious and
splendid, of a harsh and tragic beauty.

9
00:02:20,837 --> 00:02:22,395
Face to the ground!

10
00:02:28,517 --> 00:02:30,667
Peppo, careful!

11
00:02:37,837 --> 00:02:39,828
You?! It's you?

12
00:02:56,997 --> 00:02:59,306
He recognised me.

13
00:03:20,637 --> 00:03:23,754
Mafia! You?! Do me a favour!

14
00:03:23,797 --> 00:03:28,712
Here you go: threatening letters, felled trees,
blackmail, the theft of livestock...

15
00:03:28,757 --> 00:03:32,545
... and this morning they're killing
my cart drivers and stealing my mules.

16
00:03:32,597 --> 00:03:36,954
And I'm supposed to continue trusting you?
Do me favour! Don't make me laugh!

17
00:03:36,997 --> 00:03:40,546
You can tell your boss
that the mafia is finished.

18
00:03:40,757 --> 00:03:44,909
And that in these parts delinquency reigns!
Go and tell him!

19
00:03:44,957 --> 00:03:47,915
And tell him that from now on I will
be addressing the public authorities.

20
00:03:47,957 --> 00:03:52,075
At least that won't cost me anything.
It had to be today that the new judge arrives...

21
00:03:52,117 --> 00:03:57,555
Good, then we have nothing more to do here.
At your service, Baron...

22
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,074
Just a moment!

23
00:04:02,677 --> 00:04:06,556
My friends, I didn't mean to offend you,
if you took that as a lack of respect...

24
00:04:06,597 --> 00:04:10,306
- You were unwise to speak that way about
Boss Passalacqua. - Calm yourselves.

25
00:04:10,357 --> 00:04:14,191
I might have been mistaken, but you
have to admit that in my shoes...

26
00:04:14,237 --> 00:04:18,230
- In your shoes I'd choose my words carefully.
- Whoever disrespects the boss will pay.

27
00:04:18,277 --> 00:04:21,872
- No need to worry, we know who it was.
- Boss Passalacqua has already decided.

28
00:04:21,917 --> 00:04:25,671
This is your business,
I was talking about the mules.

29
00:04:25,717 --> 00:04:30,347
You'll get them back... very soon.
And from us, not from the judge.

30
00:04:30,397 --> 00:04:34,675
We don't need any judges here.
Good day, Sir...

31
00:05:20,517 --> 00:05:23,031
Is that the coach for Capodarso?

32
00:05:27,437 --> 00:05:28,870
That's it...

33
00:05:29,917 --> 00:05:31,794
Thank you.

34
00:05:36,877 --> 00:05:38,435
Guido Schiavi.

35
00:05:41,317 --> 00:05:43,273
Do we know each other?

36
00:05:43,317 --> 00:05:46,548
Someone travelling to Capodarso under
this sun, all dressed in black...

37
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:49,395
... who could you be if not Guido Schiavi?

38
00:05:49,437 --> 00:05:55,467
- They're waiting for you... at Capodarso.
- But you...? - What time is it?

39
00:05:58,477 --> 00:06:03,949
- Half past 4. - 90 minutes late,
but I'd wait for an entire day.

40
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:10,993
Listen, there's still time, the
train from Palermo isn't here yet.

41
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:14,996
- It's a question of patience. Are you
from the mainland? - No, from Palermo.

42
00:06:15,037 --> 00:06:18,473
Good, then come with me. Within
4 hours you'll be back home again...

43
00:06:18,517 --> 00:06:22,271
... then you can ask for a transfer
or otherwise resign and change trade.

44
00:06:22,317 --> 00:06:26,196
Don't worry, you'll thank me when
you know my story.

45
00:06:33,357 --> 00:06:35,234
Here it is!

46
00:06:48,677 --> 00:06:50,793
Good luck!

47
00:07:00,157 --> 00:07:03,308
He's the judge from Capodarso,
the one who resigned.

48
00:07:06,597 --> 00:07:11,591
- Are you the new judge? - Yes.
- Then hurry up and get in, I'm leaving.

49
00:08:25,237 --> 00:08:28,991
- My luggage, please.
- There's a ladder at the back.

50
00:08:29,037 --> 00:08:31,153
Thank you.

51
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:36,592
Excuse me.

52
00:08:36,997 --> 00:08:39,033
Has the judge arrived?

53
00:08:39,597 --> 00:08:43,556
Yes, help him get his luggage down,
I need to get going.

54
00:08:43,597 --> 00:08:49,627
- Ah, it's you? - Yes... - Guido
Solari. - Schiavi, Guido Schiavi.

55
00:08:49,677 --> 00:08:52,111
But please, control your enthusiasm.

56
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:55,866
Excuse us, Judge, if we're unable
to hide our disappointment.

57
00:08:55,917 --> 00:09:00,513
- Sorry, but who are you?
- The Mayor, Mr. Leopoldo Pappalardo.

58
00:09:00,557 --> 00:09:02,752
- The Chancellor.
- A pleasure...

59
00:09:02,797 --> 00:09:04,187
We thought that after the last,

60
00:09:04,288 --> 00:09:07,268
rather regrettable experience with...
you know, your predecessor?

61
00:09:07,317 --> 00:09:10,627
We thought that perhaps they would send
someone more... how should I say it?

62
00:09:10,677 --> 00:09:13,953
- Older.
- Exactly. Or less young.

63
00:09:13,997 --> 00:09:17,751
It can be a difficult place,
and your predecessor...

64
00:09:19,037 --> 00:09:21,710
I'm going, so take your luggage down.

65
00:09:22,557 --> 00:09:25,833
- What are you doing? You don't need to.
- You shouldn't have to worry about that.

66
00:09:25,877 --> 00:09:28,710
But they're my cases, and there doesn't
seem to be a luggage boy around...

67
00:09:28,757 --> 00:09:30,596
- You're the number one authority in town.
- Yes.

68
00:09:30,697 --> 00:09:32,636
- Here we value form.
- Yes.

69
00:09:32,677 --> 00:09:37,193
- Welcome, Judge. Marshal GrifÃ².
- Nice to meet you.

70
00:09:37,237 --> 00:09:41,788
- Do you value form, too, Marshal?
- Sorry Judge, I've been in the country, and...

71
00:09:44,797 --> 00:09:47,709
Hey, the cases!

72
00:09:48,197 --> 00:09:51,872
Sir, I've taken care of them.
Do you want me to take them to your house?

73
00:09:51,917 --> 00:09:53,280
My house? I already have a house?

74
00:09:53,381 --> 00:09:56,308
- The most beautiful house in the town.
- Yes, just around the corner from here.

75
00:09:56,357 --> 00:09:57,641
I see, thank you.
See you tomorrow.

76
00:09:57,692 --> 00:09:58,825
- At your service, Judge.
- We'll see you in court.

77
00:09:59,837 --> 00:10:01,270
- Good evening.
- At your service. - Good evening.

78
00:10:08,837 --> 00:10:11,510
- What's your name?
- Paolino, Sir.

79
00:10:23,677 --> 00:10:28,432
Welcome, Judge, God bless you!
Come on up, I'll just open the door.

80
00:10:37,037 --> 00:10:41,155
Come, make yourself at home,
I've prepared the room for you.

81
00:10:41,197 --> 00:10:45,668
- Good evening. - No, no, give
them to me, I serve the judge.

82
00:10:48,877 --> 00:10:51,755
- Here, Paolino.
- No, no! Good evening.

83
00:10:54,117 --> 00:10:56,028
Good evening, Paolino.

84
00:10:57,357 --> 00:10:59,427
Come in, come in.

85
00:11:04,317 --> 00:11:05,955
It's nice, isn't it?

86
00:11:13,117 --> 00:11:14,266
Nice, yes.

87
00:11:15,637 --> 00:11:18,788
You will see that everything is here,
I hope it's to your satisfaction.

88
00:11:18,837 --> 00:11:22,034
Your predecessor lived here, Mr. Pisani.

89
00:11:22,077 --> 00:11:25,228
What happened to Pisani?
He just left without waiting for me.

90
00:11:25,277 --> 00:11:29,111
You know, it's a difficult place.

91
00:11:29,157 --> 00:11:34,675
What can I say? Mr. Pisani didn't understand
the atmosphere here and the people.

92
00:11:34,717 --> 00:11:38,949
Here the people have their customs,
and one must respect them.

93
00:11:44,157 --> 00:11:49,151
- The Baroness, next door. Need anything?
- No, thank you. Good evening.

94
00:11:52,877 --> 00:11:57,951
- Was there anything else?
- You have an intelligent, friendly face.

95
00:11:57,997 --> 00:12:01,069
You will understand how things are
in these parts right away.

96
00:12:01,117 --> 00:12:05,633
So I'm happy to have you in my house,
and I like you already.

97
00:12:05,677 --> 00:12:08,635
I know everyone around here,
and you'll see...

98
00:12:08,677 --> 00:12:13,228
... people will take to you right away.

99
00:12:13,277 --> 00:12:17,065
It won't be the same as with Mr. Pisani.
If you'll excuse me...

100
00:12:44,877 --> 00:12:47,027
- My dear Lawyer!
- My dear Don Ciccio!

101
00:12:47,077 --> 00:12:50,831
- On your way to the courtroom? - Yes.
- Come on, I'm heading there myself.

102
00:12:50,877 --> 00:12:54,472
- Already? But it's only 10 O'clock!
- Well, once every so often...

103
00:12:54,517 --> 00:12:58,715
I should be in the office
when the new judge arrives.

104
00:12:58,757 --> 00:13:01,317
With time we'll calm him down, too.

105
00:13:05,197 --> 00:13:09,509
- Ah, it's you. What happened to you?
Come in, come in. - Already up?

106
00:13:10,437 --> 00:13:14,396
I thought that for the first morning...
You know, being tired from the journey...

107
00:13:14,677 --> 00:13:18,716
- Chancellor, do you know it's already 10?
- Of course, of course. Here, I...

108
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:21,908
It doesn't matter! I'm sure that with time
we will understand one another better.

109
00:13:21,957 --> 00:13:24,994
Right now you will need to find me a pair
of painters and also a bricklayer.

110
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:29,349
- A bricklayer? To do what?
- You don't see these walls? They're terrible!

111
00:13:29,397 --> 00:13:33,026
If someone coughs, bricks fall down.
Go speak to the mayor.

112
00:13:33,077 --> 00:13:38,868
- The mayor! May I? Attorney Faraglia.
- Nice to meet you. - It's an honour, Sir.

113
00:13:38,917 --> 00:13:41,989
- I'm sorry, you've caught us at a time...
- Oh, it's nothing.

114
00:13:42,037 --> 00:13:45,234
Finally, new air in this poor
and abandoned little place.

115
00:13:45,277 --> 00:13:47,393
I congratulate you, illustrious judge...

116
00:13:47,437 --> 00:13:50,429
... but you shouldn't have to wait
for anything from this administration.

117
00:13:50,477 --> 00:13:53,549
I will tell the mayor that I
represent the opposition.

118
00:13:53,597 --> 00:13:56,475
I will put the his back to the wall.

119
00:13:56,517 --> 00:13:59,554
We will fight him, my dear
illustrious and amiable judge...

120
00:13:59,597 --> 00:14:02,589
... and I put my body and soul
at your complete disposal, Sir.

121
00:14:02,637 --> 00:14:04,434
Thank you.

122
00:14:06,117 --> 00:14:09,234
Sorry, but what are you looking for?
Tell me, perhaps I can help.

123
00:14:09,277 --> 00:14:12,906
- Are there many procedures like this?
- What procedures?

124
00:14:12,957 --> 00:14:17,189
I mean, legal procedures that have been
left hanging for years, like these ones.

125
00:14:17,237 --> 00:14:21,515
- Oh... - Good day, Judge.
- Good day, Marshal.

126
00:14:21,557 --> 00:14:24,355
Can you tell me what you've been
doing in this place up until now?

127
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:27,673
There are cases that have been suspended
for two... three years!

128
00:14:28,397 --> 00:14:34,791
You see, Judge, they are old affairs
that nobody thinks of anymore.

129
00:14:34,837 --> 00:14:38,671
To take them out now, it would put
you against the entire town.

130
00:14:38,717 --> 00:14:41,151
I am the only lawyer in the town...

131
00:14:41,197 --> 00:14:46,590
... and I can tell you that
your predecessor was very wise...

132
00:14:46,637 --> 00:14:50,186
... not to antagonise the natives,
their traditions...

133
00:14:50,237 --> 00:14:54,549
Sorry for interrupting, but there's a
wounded man. It's Aleo, he's been shot.

134
00:14:54,597 --> 00:14:58,510
- If you think it appropriate to visit him...
- And why didn't you tell us sooner?

135
00:14:58,557 --> 00:15:01,071
Well, he's a criminal after all.

136
00:15:05,957 --> 00:15:10,269
Put all those legal procedures back on track,
on Saturday I shall conduct the first hearing.

137
00:15:11,837 --> 00:15:14,397
In the meantime, come with me. Let's go.

138
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:34,074
Make way, make way!

139
00:15:40,837 --> 00:15:42,668
Doctor...

140
00:16:15,797 --> 00:16:21,793
Aleo, I am the new judge.
Do you know who shot you?

141
00:16:21,837 --> 00:16:25,352
- Yes...
- Come on, talk, give me a name.

142
00:16:50,477 --> 00:16:55,187
Do it for yourself, for your parents.
Talk, tell me the name if you know it.

143
00:16:57,317 --> 00:17:03,711
If I die, they forgive him.
If I live, they kill him...

144
00:17:20,797 --> 00:17:26,155
You're his mother, do you not know anything?
An idea, a suspect...

145
00:17:28,597 --> 00:17:34,194
And you others? Nobody knows anything?
Nobody saw anything?

146
00:17:36,917 --> 00:17:38,908
Let's go, Marshal.

147
00:17:47,437 --> 00:17:48,870
Listen up!

148
00:17:50,557 --> 00:17:53,515
Ask him where he was when
the shooting took place.

149
00:17:53,997 --> 00:17:55,828
Hey, Messana!

150
00:17:56,397 --> 00:18:00,390
- Where were you this morning between 7 and 8?
- Being a good cop, Marshal?

151
00:18:00,437 --> 00:18:04,828
- Don't mess around, answer me!
- If I must. I was with the Baron, ask him.

152
00:18:14,197 --> 00:18:17,394
- Who runs the mafia around here?
- Boss Turi Passalacqua.

153
00:18:18,157 --> 00:18:23,914
- The Baron? - You know how it is,
the rich people want protection.

154
00:18:23,957 --> 00:18:27,267
- Go back inside, I'll see you later.
- Yes, Sir.

155
00:19:13,197 --> 00:19:15,950
- Morning, bandit!
- Oh, Judge... good morning.

156
00:19:15,997 --> 00:19:18,227
Looks like your girl's in trouble, eh?

157
00:19:18,277 --> 00:19:20,950
- Going this way?
- Why not?

158
00:19:22,557 --> 00:19:26,755
- What's your girl's name? - Bastianedda.
She's Lorenzina La Scaniota's daughter.

159
00:19:26,797 --> 00:19:32,235
- And is Ciccio Messana a relative of hers?
- No, he's not a relative.

160
00:19:42,917 --> 00:19:47,945
She's something, your mother. She acts like
a woman but then never wants to make love.

161
00:19:54,597 --> 00:19:56,986
In this case, she was right though.

162
00:20:01,317 --> 00:20:05,196
- I'll help you wash, stupid girl.
- She knows how to wash herself just fine!

163
00:20:07,557 --> 00:20:12,551
If you're not careful, one day she'll
get you into a lot of trouble.

164
00:20:12,597 --> 00:20:15,828
I know, she's my daughter after all.

165
00:20:24,837 --> 00:20:29,149
- How old is the girl?
- 16, it's her time.

166
00:20:29,197 --> 00:20:31,472
That's exactly what I was thinking.

167
00:20:32,597 --> 00:20:35,065
Close that door, hussy!

168
00:20:39,477 --> 00:20:41,593
And don't put your feet on the bed.

169
00:20:43,677 --> 00:20:46,987
Why don't you let me marry her?
You can come too.

170
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:50,347
You would be able to stay at home all day.
I'm serious.

171
00:20:50,397 --> 00:20:56,996
I've already told you no. You would just
take her away and leave me behind.

172
00:21:00,157 --> 00:21:03,308
I said it out of concern for you.
Think about it.

173
00:21:05,677 --> 00:21:07,269
Where are you going?

174
00:21:07,677 --> 00:21:10,191
- Business.
- Vanni Vetriolo?

175
00:21:11,517 --> 00:21:15,271
Things that aren't of any interest to women.
Goodbye, Bastianedda!

176
00:21:19,477 --> 00:21:22,150
- Good day.
- Good day.

177
00:21:24,717 --> 00:21:26,594
Don Peppino, aniseed!

178
00:21:27,957 --> 00:21:30,551
- Did you not hear?
- No.

179
00:21:31,597 --> 00:21:34,065
Aleo Calogero is dead.

180
00:21:35,277 --> 00:21:36,676
Shot.

181
00:21:51,077 --> 00:21:52,396
Another.

182
00:22:08,397 --> 00:22:11,833
- Bye, everyone.
- Bye.

183
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,509
Hey!

184
00:22:27,517 --> 00:22:31,908
You know where I live, don't you?
Go to my house, tell mother that I had to leave.

185
00:22:31,957 --> 00:22:33,868
And that I don't know when I'll be back.

186
00:22:33,917 --> 00:22:38,195
- Got it? - Yes.
- Tell her goodbye from me. Her and Father.

187
00:22:38,237 --> 00:22:39,556
Scram.

188
00:23:38,997 --> 00:23:42,194
- Greetings, Vanni. Where are you off
to in this heat? - Good day.

189
00:23:42,237 --> 00:23:47,675
- Whose are those mules? - Mine.
- Since when have you owned mules?

190
00:23:48,197 --> 00:23:51,746
Hey, come here a moment.
I want to take a look.

191
00:23:53,437 --> 00:23:55,428
Vanni, stop!

192
00:23:55,477 --> 00:23:58,708
Halt!

193
00:24:28,637 --> 00:24:31,913
- Who's there? - Is the Baron home?
It's the judge.

194
00:24:32,717 --> 00:24:35,595
Wait a moment, I'll come and open the door.

195
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:40,788
Hold on, I'll let him know.

196
00:25:01,797 --> 00:25:04,391
- Excuse me.
- Come in.

197
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:09,828
- May I? Guido Schiavi.
- Yes, I know, the new judge.

198
00:25:09,877 --> 00:25:15,076
- In this town everyone knows everything.
- I interrupted you, I'm sorry. - No, no...

199
00:25:15,837 --> 00:25:17,907
I have all day to play.

200
00:25:18,877 --> 00:25:22,313
I hear you playing from my house sometimes,
when I get home, in the evenings.

201
00:25:22,357 --> 00:25:25,269
- Does it bother you?
- No, actually, I like to hear it.

202
00:25:25,317 --> 00:25:30,437
At the end of the day, with the dark,
the thoughts of work can become too much.

203
00:25:30,477 --> 00:25:34,311
- The music keeps me company.
- I don't imagine you'll be here for very long.

204
00:25:34,357 --> 00:25:36,154
This isn't the kind of place to build a career.

205
00:25:36,197 --> 00:25:40,110
- Pleased to meet you, dear judge.
- A pleasure.

206
00:25:40,157 --> 00:25:42,876
I don't need to introduce my wife, I see.

207
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:46,273
Please, come through. Bring us coffee.

208
00:25:46,317 --> 00:25:47,989
Come, come.

209
00:25:50,997 --> 00:25:55,115
- Greetings, dear judge.
- Attorney. - Sit down.

210
00:25:55,157 --> 00:25:57,796
The Baron insisted that I stay.

211
00:25:57,837 --> 00:26:00,510
We were in a meeting up until you arrived.

212
00:26:00,557 --> 00:26:04,436
We're glad that you took the time
to stop by, my client is very grateful.

213
00:26:04,477 --> 00:26:08,311
- Just doing my duty. - My lawyer has
told me great things about you.

214
00:26:08,357 --> 00:26:12,987
I see you've taken to the job with energy,
isn't that right? Doing what you feel is right.

215
00:26:13,037 --> 00:26:16,109
I imagine that it won't be easy.

216
00:26:19,237 --> 00:26:22,866
Yes, I find myself up against
some very serious difficulties.

217
00:26:22,917 --> 00:26:26,466
- I've come to speak with you about mules.
- What mules?

218
00:26:26,517 --> 00:26:29,156
Those that were stolen some days ago.

219
00:26:29,197 --> 00:26:32,428
- I see you're well-informed.
- Yes, and it wasn't easy.

220
00:26:32,477 --> 00:26:37,870
Because, if I may be so forward as to point out,
you didn't report the theft to the authorities.

221
00:26:37,917 --> 00:26:40,511
Well, for something of such little importance...

222
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:42,707
A man was killed so that they
could steal your mules!

223
00:26:42,757 --> 00:26:45,066
For this you will need to speak
to the relatives of the victim.

224
00:26:45,117 --> 00:26:48,189
Yesterday another was killed out of
revenge for the death of the first.

225
00:26:48,237 --> 00:26:51,115
- And I don't want to see a third.
- Anyway...

226
00:26:51,157 --> 00:26:55,036
Hold on, I said that I came
to speak with you about the mules.

227
00:26:55,077 --> 00:26:58,308
In fact, your mules have been
found by one of my policemen.

228
00:26:58,357 --> 00:27:02,032
- You can send someone to retrieve them.
- Well, you astound me!

229
00:27:02,077 --> 00:27:06,673
- Why? - That's the first time the police
have ever found anything around here.

230
00:27:06,717 --> 00:27:09,550
Luck.

231
00:27:09,597 --> 00:27:12,873
Nothing but luck. But I hope it continues.

232
00:27:12,917 --> 00:27:17,229
See, Judge, you need to account
for the traditions, the customs...

233
00:27:17,277 --> 00:27:19,154
Yes, yes, I see.

234
00:27:19,197 --> 00:27:21,665
- Coffee?
- Thank you.

235
00:27:28,037 --> 00:27:31,950
- You're not Sicilian, are you? - On the
contrary, I'm from Palermo? - Oh, really?

236
00:27:32,877 --> 00:27:34,833
From your accent I wouldn't have guessed.

237
00:27:34,877 --> 00:27:37,471
I'm Sicilian and I will
be accounting for everything.

238
00:27:37,517 --> 00:27:42,386
This is why I came to you,
to ask for your co-operation, your help.

239
00:27:43,157 --> 00:27:46,035
Do you know Boss Turi Passalacqua?

240
00:27:47,597 --> 00:27:50,953
- Not yet.
- I can introduce you.

241
00:27:50,997 --> 00:27:54,751
No one in this town will be able to help you
more than him. With Passalacqua's protection...

242
00:27:54,797 --> 00:27:57,027
I see I haven't explained myself very well.

243
00:27:57,077 --> 00:28:01,389
My wish is for everyone, including yourself
and Boss Turi Passalacqua...

244
00:28:01,437 --> 00:28:05,828
... to be put under the protection of
the law, even if I have to do it myself.

245
00:28:10,877 --> 00:28:15,029
You seem to be asking for power and
influence that I simply do not have.

246
00:28:15,077 --> 00:28:19,355
- I see.
- My regards, dear judge.

247
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:21,274
Goodbye.

248
00:28:21,317 --> 00:28:25,595
- How old are you, if you don't
mind me asking? - 26.

249
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:30,950
- Very young for a judge. Well done.
- Thank you.

250
00:28:59,117 --> 00:29:02,996
Judge, Vanni Vetriolo is within our grasp.

251
00:29:03,037 --> 00:29:05,631
- Have you found him?
- Almost, I've arrested his parents.

252
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:07,986
He's a killer, but he still loves them.

253
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:11,234
To make bail they will need money.
Within two days he'll be ours.

254
00:29:11,277 --> 00:29:15,475
- You've committed an offence, do you see?
- But, Judge, Sir...

255
00:29:15,517 --> 00:29:18,987
Let them out immediately. Let's go.

256
00:29:22,357 --> 00:29:24,712
Come on, the judge is here.

257
00:29:34,357 --> 00:29:36,234
Where is Vanni?

258
00:29:37,357 --> 00:29:39,666
Your son Vanni, where is he?

259
00:29:40,917 --> 00:29:43,636
It is in your interest that I ask.

260
00:29:45,677 --> 00:29:48,635
If you love him so much,
tell me where he is, so that I can save him.

261
00:29:48,677 --> 00:29:52,909
We haven't seen Vanni,
but my wife is dying of pain.

262
00:29:55,317 --> 00:29:58,707
Return to your house,
you are free to go.

263
00:29:58,757 --> 00:30:02,636
- The judge has told you to go home.
- Go on, go on.

264
00:30:13,917 --> 00:30:17,751
You would think that my job would be
easy in a town like this...

265
00:30:18,797 --> 00:30:21,357
I know, mine too.

266
00:30:28,357 --> 00:30:32,145
- Enough! Silence! - Thieves!
- They should tear out your hearts!

267
00:30:32,197 --> 00:30:34,586
- Sell outs! - May God strike down on you!
- Quiet, you!

268
00:30:34,637 --> 00:30:39,233
- Want a smack in the face? - You think so?
- Yes, I do! - Stop that!

269
00:30:48,837 --> 00:30:50,873
Look at Don Carletto in his gown!

270
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:11,633
It was him who wanted us to wear the gown.
And he made me put this on as well.

271
00:31:37,317 --> 00:31:40,992
Loguzzo, Carmelo and Parise, Filippo.

272
00:31:41,037 --> 00:31:44,347
- Do you have lawyers?
- How would we pay for a lawyer?

273
00:31:44,837 --> 00:31:47,112
Sir, you will serve as the defence of Loguzzo.

274
00:31:47,157 --> 00:31:50,308
Attorney Faraglia, you will defend Parise.

275
00:31:50,357 --> 00:31:55,112
- Okay. - Parise, that guy will defend you well!
- You're saved, Parise.

276
00:31:55,157 --> 00:31:58,627
- Next time ask the Baron to defend you.
- Silence!

277
00:32:01,797 --> 00:32:04,072
Loguzzo, Carmelo and Parise, Filippo...

278
00:32:04,117 --> 00:32:07,507
... you are charged with being seen together,
having some kind of physical altercation...

279
00:32:07,557 --> 00:32:09,593
.. and damaging property in the process.

280
00:32:09,637 --> 00:32:13,232
This offence is punishable under the article...
etcetera, etcetera...

281
00:32:14,877 --> 00:32:16,788
Tell us what happened.

282
00:32:16,837 --> 00:32:19,351
They are taking the bread from our mouths,
him and his parents.

283
00:32:19,397 --> 00:32:23,754
They offer to work as farmhands
for 50 lire less than us.

284
00:32:23,797 --> 00:32:26,994
He's a miner, not a farmhand.
But they always do this, all of them.

285
00:32:27,037 --> 00:32:29,312
So the price for labour goes down.

286
00:32:29,357 --> 00:32:32,713
- They steal bread and work.
- I have a wife and kids, they need to eat.

287
00:32:32,757 --> 00:32:35,555
- I have a wife and kids too!
- We've been unemployed for 3 years.

288
00:32:38,357 --> 00:32:43,351
- Make them reopen the mine, do your job!
- Enough! Get out!

289
00:32:44,717 --> 00:32:46,628
Just a moment, Marshal. Hold on.

290
00:32:48,037 --> 00:32:55,830
- You, what did you say? - Pay no attention
to them, Judge, they're ignorant people.

291
00:32:57,197 --> 00:33:00,075
Come here. What did you say

292
00:33:02,557 --> 00:33:06,789
Come closer, don't be afraid.
Repeat what you said.

293
00:33:08,397 --> 00:33:12,026
I was talking about the mine,
it's been closed for three years.

294
00:33:12,077 --> 00:33:16,355
You told me to do my job,
to make them reopen the mine. Why?

295
00:33:16,397 --> 00:33:19,469
It's been 8 months since the court
ordered for it to be reopened.

296
00:33:19,517 --> 00:33:24,716
No, not to reopen it, to survey it.
Just a survey.

297
00:33:24,757 --> 00:33:28,545
- And we're dying of hunger!
- Judge, what about all this racket?

298
00:33:28,597 --> 00:33:33,466
We've been waiting for 8 months,
they can't do anything right!

299
00:33:33,517 --> 00:33:36,907
- And who does the mine belong to?
- What does that matter? - The Baron!

300
00:33:36,957 --> 00:33:40,836
He closed it and doesn't want to reopen it.
He bought it all and we're dying of hunger.

301
00:33:40,877 --> 00:33:44,233
- The court ordered it to be reopened!
- What happened to that order?

302
00:33:46,637 --> 00:33:51,427
Silence! If there's a decree from
the court, it will be carried out.

303
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:55,628
We do not misplace or ignore
important files in this office.

304
00:33:56,797 --> 00:33:58,515
Continue with the hearing.

305
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:13,032
Sir, it's your turn.

306
00:34:13,917 --> 00:34:18,911
- Oh, dear Judge, we're happy to
see you visit our circle! - Thank you.

307
00:34:18,957 --> 00:34:24,395
- Does everyone know each other? - Judge...
- Oh, Attorney.

308
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:28,271
- Good evening. - You've come to
speak with me, have you? - Yes.

309
00:34:28,317 --> 00:34:31,070
Mayor, sit down. Please, take my place.

310
00:34:31,117 --> 00:34:34,792
I get no satisfaction from playing
against such adversaries.

311
00:34:41,797 --> 00:34:47,349
They're a little cold, aren't they? Things will
change, this is your first time here after all.

312
00:34:47,397 --> 00:34:50,230
- Anyway, this is about the mine, yes?
- Exactly.

313
00:34:50,277 --> 00:34:54,475
I see that Attorney Faraglia
has brought you up to speed.

314
00:34:54,517 --> 00:34:57,475
In fact, I've dusted off this old file.

315
00:34:57,517 --> 00:35:00,987
- The mine is not yours, is it?
- No, it's my wife's.

316
00:35:01,037 --> 00:35:03,676
I run it, though the power
is merely delegated to me.

317
00:35:03,717 --> 00:35:06,914
Yes, I know, the mine and the land.

318
00:35:06,957 --> 00:35:10,996
You are very young and impulsive,
my dear judge.

319
00:35:11,037 --> 00:35:15,076
The young never stop to think
that everything happens for a reason.

320
00:35:15,117 --> 00:35:17,790
A profound reason at that,
my dear judge.

321
00:35:18,037 --> 00:35:21,029
If the mine is closed, it hasn't
happened by chance...

322
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:24,149
... it's closed because the proprietor
has no interest in keeping it open.

323
00:35:24,197 --> 00:35:27,587
And if a decree from the court has
been filed away for 8 months...

324
00:35:27,637 --> 00:35:33,553
... then this didnÂt happen by chance either,
but because of a series of very serious motives.

325
00:35:33,597 --> 00:35:36,395
As you see, in just a few words
we have exhausted this argument.

326
00:35:36,437 --> 00:35:38,155
A cognac?

327
00:35:38,397 --> 00:35:40,592
Two cognacs!

328
00:35:40,637 --> 00:35:44,425
In that case, I see no reason why
the mine must remain closed.

329
00:35:44,477 --> 00:35:48,356
Why, because you plan to carry out
this decree from the court...

330
00:35:48,397 --> 00:35:50,467
... and survey it yourself?

331
00:35:51,157 --> 00:35:54,627
I came to you out of trust, Baron.

332
00:35:54,677 --> 00:35:57,396
There are 200 families of
miners that are going hungry.

333
00:35:57,437 --> 00:36:00,395
Every day this misery provokes
all kinds of bloody brawls.

334
00:36:00,437 --> 00:36:02,667
I was sure that you would
understand this problem...

335
00:36:02,717 --> 00:36:06,392
... and help me save these unfortunate
people who are all depending on you.

336
00:36:07,357 --> 00:36:09,427
I see I was mistaken.

337
00:36:11,317 --> 00:36:15,788
That which I cannot achieve through you,
I will achieve through the law.

338
00:36:15,837 --> 00:36:21,036
The law! Go and ask Boss Turi Passalacqua
who makes the laws around here.

339
00:36:21,077 --> 00:36:23,796
You are wrong to have
taken this tone with me.

340
00:36:23,837 --> 00:36:27,910
After all, the only person in this town
not laughing at you is me.

341
00:36:27,957 --> 00:36:31,313
Do what you believe is right,
visit the mine whenever you like.

342
00:36:31,357 --> 00:36:35,316
But don't bother me again, and
don't force me to write to Rome.

343
00:36:35,357 --> 00:36:38,269
- I thank you for your frankness.
- Why?

344
00:36:38,317 --> 00:36:40,785
Now I know exactly what I must do.

345
00:36:42,797 --> 00:36:44,469
You don't know just yet.

346
00:36:53,037 --> 00:36:58,191
On the basis of the survey, it is clear
that the main scaffolding...

347
00:36:58,237 --> 00:37:00,876
... shows serious signs of water damage...

348
00:37:00,917 --> 00:37:03,875
- I'm sorry, "damage"?
- Water damage.

349
00:37:03,917 --> 00:37:08,547
... presumably caused by water from
overhanging banks of sulphur.

350
00:37:08,597 --> 00:37:12,192
Prolonged inactivity will lead
to the collapse of the tunnel...

351
00:37:12,237 --> 00:37:17,470
... permanently jeopardising an
eventual resuming of work in the mine.

352
00:37:17,517 --> 00:37:19,826
- I have finished, Judge.
- Thank goodness! - About time!

353
00:37:19,877 --> 00:37:22,107
What you do with this information
is entirely up to you.

354
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:25,149
As long as you don't use it against my client.

355
00:37:25,197 --> 00:37:29,748
My work here was done with a neutral stance,
I only accepted to do the survey because...

356
00:37:29,797 --> 00:37:32,231
Because you're a mining engineer, okay.

357
00:37:32,277 --> 00:37:34,233
Don't worry, I will let everyone know
of your neutrality.

358
00:37:34,277 --> 00:37:38,589
And if you want a piece of advice, now that
you've seen the place and saved face...

359
00:37:38,637 --> 00:37:40,628
... you should leave this matter alone.

360
00:37:40,677 --> 00:37:45,068
Excellent advice, and I should add,
if you plan to stand against him...

361
00:37:45,117 --> 00:37:50,111
... you should know that the Baron, my client,
has people in Palermo, in Rome...

362
00:37:56,597 --> 00:37:58,189
... and here.

363
00:37:58,877 --> 00:38:01,232
Above all, here.

364
00:38:09,597 --> 00:38:11,588
The mafia.

365
00:39:02,797 --> 00:39:06,710
Good day, Sir.
Welcome to our land.

366
00:39:06,757 --> 00:39:09,908
It's an honour to have you here,
for here Sir is always welcome.

367
00:39:09,957 --> 00:39:12,391
A pleasure to meet you, Sir.

368
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:18,068
- Boss Gallinella.
- Sir.

369
00:39:19,517 --> 00:39:21,348
Boss Parisi.

370
00:39:22,157 --> 00:39:23,875
Carmine.

371
00:39:24,197 --> 00:39:25,676
Tagliano.

372
00:39:25,717 --> 00:39:26,991
Gambino.

373
00:39:27,037 --> 00:39:28,629
Salomone...

374
00:39:28,677 --> 00:39:30,508
Ciccio Messana.

375
00:39:34,677 --> 00:39:39,592
Sir is very young, my friends
and I are happy about this...

376
00:39:39,637 --> 00:39:43,186
... because we know that he who is
young is also pure of heart.

377
00:39:43,237 --> 00:39:46,786
If Sir would like, perhaps we
could travel a little way together.

378
00:39:46,837 --> 00:39:49,590
It would be a pleasure, Sir.

379
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:51,946
I would have come to Sir's
office to pay my respects...

380
00:39:51,997 --> 00:39:54,909
... but the olive harvest
has taken up all my time.

381
00:39:54,957 --> 00:39:58,916
Being an intelligent man, Sir will have
already realised how things go around here.

382
00:39:58,957 --> 00:40:02,506
If I am to be honest, in my opinion
things are going very badly.

383
00:40:02,557 --> 00:40:05,708
Things have been like this for more than
100 years, and but everyone here is happy.

384
00:40:05,757 --> 00:40:09,716
Not everyone. The murder victims, for example,
the blackmailed, their families.

385
00:40:09,757 --> 00:40:13,989
- And then there are the miners, farmhands...
- Every order has its weaknesses.

386
00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:17,074
Besides, between men of honour
an agreement is always possible.

387
00:40:17,117 --> 00:40:20,666
Sir only has to express his desires...

388
00:40:20,717 --> 00:40:25,916
See, Sir, there's just one thing that
I desire and that I must do at any cost...

389
00:40:25,957 --> 00:40:30,394
... to administer justice for the benefit
of all, in accordance with the law.

390
00:40:30,437 --> 00:40:35,033
- What law, Judge?
- The only one I know: that of the State.

391
00:40:35,517 --> 00:40:41,114
- Look over your shoulder, Judge.
- I've seen them, Sir. Your men.

392
00:40:41,157 --> 00:40:47,073
You're a brave one, but the law here is
made in accordance with ancient customs.

393
00:40:47,117 --> 00:40:50,792
We're on an island here,
the Government is very far away...

394
00:40:50,837 --> 00:40:54,147
... and if it wasn't for us and
our severity...

395
00:40:54,197 --> 00:40:58,349
... the gangs would ruin everything,
like weeds in the wheat field.

396
00:40:58,397 --> 00:41:01,514
Nobody would be safe in their own house.

397
00:41:01,557 --> 00:41:04,833
We are not criminals,
we are men of honour...

398
00:41:04,877 --> 00:41:08,233
... free and independent
like the birds in the sky.

399
00:41:08,277 --> 00:41:13,476
Then you will have to be my allies, Sir.
You know that the miners are hungry.

400
00:41:13,517 --> 00:41:15,712
And you also know who killed Aleo Calogero.

401
00:41:15,757 --> 00:41:18,794
Help me get the mine reopened and
hand over Calogero's killer...

402
00:41:18,837 --> 00:41:20,634
... if you are indeed men of honour.

403
00:41:20,997 --> 00:41:23,989
The shoves of children are caresses to men.

404
00:41:24,237 --> 00:41:29,027
My words have been those of peace,
but yours have not. For that I'm sorry.

405
00:41:29,077 --> 00:41:31,272
Good day, Sir.

406
00:41:47,637 --> 00:41:49,946
- Jesus Christ...
- He's offended the mafia.

407
00:41:49,997 --> 00:41:54,309
Jesus Christ, he's as crazy
as they come! He's crazy...

408
00:42:06,277 --> 00:42:11,874
You're a gutsy man, Judge. From
today you can count on me all the way.

409
00:42:11,917 --> 00:42:16,388
Unfortunately with Boss Passalacqua there's no
middle ground: you're either friends or enemies.

410
00:42:16,437 --> 00:42:19,713
We are now his enemies, God help us.

411
00:42:20,117 --> 00:42:21,869
Thank you, Marshal.

412
00:42:33,277 --> 00:42:36,633
This is all we needed around here,
this arrogant imbecile.

413
00:42:36,677 --> 00:42:41,034
- Send it! Send it right away!
- On my way home, Baron.

414
00:42:41,077 --> 00:42:44,956
Within two days this will be in Rome
and his transfer will be made certain.

415
00:42:44,997 --> 00:42:49,070
- Besides, now that he's disrespected
Boss Passalacqua... - A disgrace...

416
00:42:49,117 --> 00:42:50,596
Good evening, Baron.

417
00:42:50,637 --> 00:42:52,832
We will be done with him long before
his report on the mine is affected.

418
00:42:52,877 --> 00:42:54,310
Good evening.

419
00:42:58,957 --> 00:43:00,993
A disgrace...

420
00:43:28,517 --> 00:43:30,314
Does it bother you?

421
00:43:32,397 --> 00:43:34,069
Yes!

422
00:44:35,037 --> 00:44:37,551
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

423
00:44:46,477 --> 00:44:52,313
- I had come down to here you play...
It was Chopin, wasn't it? - No...

424
00:44:53,597 --> 00:44:57,909
Well, I don't know much about music.
Actually, I know nothing, but I like it.

425
00:44:57,957 --> 00:45:03,634
- Yes, I know. - You know?!
- You told me. It keeps you company.

426
00:45:03,797 --> 00:45:08,348
- Yes, and it keeps me sad, too.
- Me too...

427
00:45:11,277 --> 00:45:16,397
- But what isn't sad in this place?
- You weren't born here? - No.

428
00:45:16,437 --> 00:45:20,032
- And none of your family are here?
- No.

429
00:45:21,837 --> 00:45:25,193
Listen, this morning you
disrespected the mafia...

430
00:45:25,237 --> 00:45:29,389
... in town everybody knows, and
now all of them plan to ruin you.

431
00:45:29,437 --> 00:45:33,669
- What should I do?
- Go. Leave, don't stay here.

432
00:45:33,717 --> 00:45:37,756
This place is a graveyard. Those lucky
enough to be able to leave, should go.

433
00:45:37,797 --> 00:45:45,477
- And you? - I have no reason to stay here,
nor to go anywhere else. But not you.

434
00:45:45,517 --> 00:45:50,637
You are full of enthusiasm, of strength.
Leave here, save yourself.

435
00:45:50,677 --> 00:45:53,987
- Baroness...
- Oh, don't call me that.

436
00:45:54,037 --> 00:45:58,952
They sold me, me and all I had
for the title, and when I hear it...

437
00:46:02,117 --> 00:46:04,585
Don't move, Judge.
Don't scream, Baroness.

438
00:46:04,637 --> 00:46:10,348
- What do you want? Who are you?
- Vanni Vetriolo, I'm not here to hurt you.

439
00:46:10,397 --> 00:46:14,151
I know that you released my folks
from prison, and I'm here to thank you.

440
00:46:14,197 --> 00:46:17,075
I'm sorry for everything bad I've done,
but by now there is no putting it right.

441
00:46:17,117 --> 00:46:20,507
The mafia wants me dead,
and one day or another...

442
00:46:20,557 --> 00:46:23,754
... you will see me with my hands
folded on my chest.

443
00:46:23,797 --> 00:46:27,631
My lady, forgive me if I scared you.
Judge, goodbye.

444
00:46:27,677 --> 00:46:30,510
You are a real gentleman,
may God be with you.

445
00:46:31,237 --> 00:46:34,593
Vanni, stop there!
Listen to me, Vanni!

446
00:46:37,357 --> 00:46:39,348
Damn...

447
00:46:49,357 --> 00:46:53,270
You're trembling. Were you afraid?

448
00:46:55,317 --> 00:46:56,466
No!

449
00:46:56,517 --> 00:46:59,509
Miss... Miss Teresa!

450
00:47:44,877 --> 00:47:47,789
- Bastianedda, are you not dancing?
- I'm tired.

451
00:47:47,837 --> 00:47:51,716
- She's already danced enough.
- You're right, I'm tired too.

452
00:47:52,197 --> 00:47:54,472
Francesco!

453
00:48:03,237 --> 00:48:04,829
Go on, dance.

454
00:48:07,757 --> 00:48:10,908
- But I... - Go, I said.
Don't you dare disrespect me.

455
00:48:35,117 --> 00:48:38,427
- Judge, welcome! - Hello, Paolino.
You weren't expecting me, were you?

456
00:48:38,477 --> 00:48:42,152
- Actually no. It's my cousin getting married.
- So many people!

457
00:48:42,197 --> 00:48:46,076
- I feel like dancing a little myself.
- Really? Sir is teasing me...

458
00:48:46,117 --> 00:48:49,029
- Why, do you think I'm 90 years old?
- Then come, Sir, come and sit down.

459
00:48:49,077 --> 00:48:51,637
Your visit is an honour. Come, come...

460
00:49:00,397 --> 00:49:03,946
- Many congratulations and happiness
to you both. - Thank you, Sir.

461
00:49:03,997 --> 00:49:07,148
Though I am sorry to have
interrupted the celebration.

462
00:49:12,957 --> 00:49:15,107
Come on, hit it!

463
00:49:23,997 --> 00:49:26,557
That's enough of your simpering.

464
00:49:50,637 --> 00:49:53,231
Bastianedda.

465
00:49:53,277 --> 00:49:56,906
Bastianedda... what is it?

466
00:49:56,957 --> 00:50:00,188
- Something's happened, Paolino.
- What?

467
00:50:00,237 --> 00:50:04,025
Ciccio Messana wants to marry me.
He's asked my mother.

468
00:50:11,517 --> 00:50:13,712
Music! Come on, music!

469
00:50:38,117 --> 00:50:43,191
I'm happy to see you again, Sir...
and keeping such good company, too.

470
00:50:43,237 --> 00:50:48,470
Hosts and guests, please excuse the guns,
we're returning from a hunt.

471
00:50:48,517 --> 00:50:52,590
- A good hunt...
- And where's the game, Sir?

472
00:50:52,637 --> 00:50:56,676
Here, Judge.
A small gift for the young couple.

473
00:51:00,117 --> 00:51:03,996
We have discovered the body of
Giovanni Vetriolo...

474
00:51:04,037 --> 00:51:07,268
... that which, after an initial examination,
appears to have received two shots...

475
00:51:07,317 --> 00:51:09,592
... that look to be the reason of death.

476
00:51:09,637 --> 00:51:11,707
The shots were fired from close range.

477
00:51:11,757 --> 00:51:15,352
Stated, confirmed and signed.
Capodarso, 10th of September, 1948.

478
00:51:15,397 --> 00:51:17,433
- Okay?
- Yes, that's fine.

479
00:51:18,877 --> 00:51:23,587
- The cartridge case! 12-gauge!
- That's what everyone has around here.

480
00:51:29,157 --> 00:51:31,466
- Well, do you still need me?
- No.

481
00:51:31,517 --> 00:51:35,396
Then I'm off, these shoes are hurting my feet...

482
00:51:52,117 --> 00:51:54,506
Marshal! Take a look at this.

483
00:52:10,477 --> 00:52:14,550
You don't have to be afraid, you'll be protected
even if you tell us. What did you see?

484
00:52:16,077 --> 00:52:18,511
When they killed Vetriolo,
you weren't far away.

485
00:52:18,557 --> 00:52:21,515
- You didn't see anybody? Hear anything?
- No, Sir.

486
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:29,355
What would I know about it?
Here, we work and mind our own business.

487
00:52:29,397 --> 00:52:31,911
But they killed him just
300 metres from the house.

488
00:52:31,957 --> 00:52:34,755
We were all asleep, Sir.

489
00:52:42,877 --> 00:52:46,233
- Good day, everyone! - My respects.
- Good to see you, Sir, it's an honour.

490
00:52:46,277 --> 00:52:49,747
- My respects, Boss. - My respects.
- Good day.

491
00:52:55,957 --> 00:53:00,030
Good day. May I offer you a drink?

492
00:53:00,077 --> 00:53:03,672
No, thank you, Marshal...
Perhaps I can offer you one.

493
00:53:10,677 --> 00:53:13,828
The youth should not harbour
such dark thoughts, my dear judge...

494
00:53:13,877 --> 00:53:16,516
... leave that to us men of the old world.

495
00:53:16,557 --> 00:53:20,106
And allow this humble boss to
join you for a drink...

496
00:53:20,157 --> 00:53:22,193
... to your health.

497
00:53:26,837 --> 00:53:32,275
This morning, at the bottom of the valley...
where you and Gallinella passed yesterday...

498
00:53:32,317 --> 00:53:35,866
... we found Vanni Vetriolo... dead.

499
00:53:35,917 --> 00:53:40,149
Killed like a dog, with two shots
straight to the chest, point-blank range.

500
00:53:41,437 --> 00:53:44,634
Now, I won't ask where you were
before arriving at the party...

501
00:53:44,677 --> 00:53:47,237
... that would be useless.

502
00:53:47,277 --> 00:53:50,269
But I will ask you one thing,
and you will answer me.

503
00:53:50,317 --> 00:53:54,196
How do you call those men who kill
other men in cold blood? Tell me!

504
00:54:10,557 --> 00:54:12,787
Vetriolo wasn't a man.

505
00:54:13,677 --> 00:54:16,794
Of all his misdeeds,
this one was unforgivable...

506
00:54:16,837 --> 00:54:20,273
... he killed the cart driver Parrinello.

507
00:54:21,237 --> 00:54:24,354
Therefore, Judge, Vetriolo was made to pay.

508
00:54:24,397 --> 00:54:29,152
Whether it was you to try him with your
array of men and useless papers...

509
00:54:29,197 --> 00:54:32,348
... or two shots from a
double-barrelled shotgun...

510
00:54:33,077 --> 00:54:35,272
... what difference does it make?

511
00:54:36,357 --> 00:54:40,145
Justice has been done. That's what counts.

512
00:54:41,117 --> 00:54:45,429
Justice... what justice?

513
00:54:48,117 --> 00:54:51,348
And the men that killed him,
what do you call them?

514
00:54:51,397 --> 00:54:56,630
Men of honour? No, Sir...
Bandits and killers, nothing else.

515
00:54:59,277 --> 00:55:05,716
I have a son of about your age, who is
studying and who will honour my name...

516
00:55:05,757 --> 00:55:08,351
... just like you honour your father's.

517
00:55:08,397 --> 00:55:11,309
So forget this encounter.

518
00:55:11,357 --> 00:55:16,226
When you are older and I am
no longer around anymore...

519
00:55:16,277 --> 00:55:19,986
... perhaps Sir will go about
things better than this old man...

520
00:55:20,037 --> 00:55:23,268
... and will understand that his
laws were just laws of nature...

521
00:55:23,317 --> 00:55:29,028
... in which he honestly believed and
tried to apply in good faith...

522
00:55:29,077 --> 00:55:31,272
... always as a gentleman...

523
00:55:31,877 --> 00:55:35,665
... just as Sir, in good faith,
applies his own laws.

524
00:55:41,037 --> 00:55:43,346
Sir, I cannot.

525
00:55:46,757 --> 00:55:49,146
My respects, Judge.

526
00:55:59,877 --> 00:56:01,754
What should I do?

527
00:56:01,797 --> 00:56:05,153
Hand in my resignation like Pisani,
give up on the fight...

528
00:56:05,197 --> 00:56:08,667
... and use the excuse that things
have always been like this?

529
00:56:08,717 --> 00:56:12,835
Judge, everybody thinks it will end like
that. They're not expecting anything else.

530
00:56:12,877 --> 00:56:14,390
I know...

531
00:56:18,957 --> 00:56:23,030
- Oh, Paolino, what is it?
- Sir, please excuse me...

532
00:56:23,077 --> 00:56:27,275
I wanted... It's just that Ciccio Messana
wants Bastianedda as his wife.

533
00:56:27,317 --> 00:56:29,956
And what do you think the judge can...

534
00:56:29,997 --> 00:56:31,669
Come.

535
00:56:35,717 --> 00:56:37,355
Tell me everything.

536
00:56:38,117 --> 00:56:40,392
I suppose her mother has said yes?

537
00:56:42,757 --> 00:56:47,114
I don't know, Judge,
but Bastianedda is afraid.

538
00:56:47,157 --> 00:56:50,945
I wanted my father to ask her mother
before she promises her to Ciccio.

539
00:56:50,997 --> 00:56:53,955
But my father says that I'm too young.

540
00:56:53,997 --> 00:56:59,117
- And that Bastianedda's mother is
a shady character. - And he's right.

541
00:57:00,357 --> 00:57:04,236
Please help me, Judge. If they don't
let me marry her, I'll force them to.

542
00:57:04,277 --> 00:57:06,745
- And what will you do?
- I know what I'll do.

543
00:57:06,797 --> 00:57:11,951
Paolino, calm down. In one way or another
things will work out for the best.

544
00:57:11,997 --> 00:57:16,468
- Oh, listen, this must be yours.
- No, that's Gallinella's.

545
00:57:16,517 --> 00:57:20,396
Yesterday he came to the farm looking for it.
He said that it's very lucky.

546
00:57:22,517 --> 00:57:26,032
Yes... it could well be.

547
00:57:26,677 --> 00:57:30,147
So you wanted me to speak to your father?

548
00:57:30,197 --> 00:57:37,626
- Oh, if you don't mind...
- Then we'll see what your father says.

549
00:57:37,677 --> 00:57:41,795
- Thank you, Sir. My respects...
- Goodbye.

550
00:57:54,237 --> 00:57:55,386
Paolino!

551
00:57:56,557 --> 00:57:59,833
- Where have you been?
- What do you care?

552
00:58:05,837 --> 00:58:08,032
Tano Gallinella...

553
00:58:09,077 --> 00:58:11,147
What do you think?

554
00:58:13,517 --> 00:58:15,633
Right, Judge.

555
00:58:17,437 --> 00:58:19,348
Let's go, I'm coming with you.

556
00:58:58,157 --> 00:59:00,273
- Be careful.
- Okay.

557
00:59:18,797 --> 00:59:23,109
- Good day, Sir!
- Good day, Marshal.

558
00:59:24,317 --> 00:59:26,706
It's you I was looking for.

559
00:59:42,797 --> 00:59:48,315
- I keep good company, don't I?
- Exactly, and so do I.

560
00:59:48,917 --> 00:59:50,794
Let's get this over with.

561
00:59:52,037 --> 00:59:55,632
Listen up. Let me have a look
at barrel of your shotgun.

562
00:59:58,797 --> 01:00:00,708
Be my guest.

563
01:00:04,797 --> 01:00:07,630
- It's the same.
- Okay.

564
01:00:07,877 --> 01:00:10,869
- Then we can go.
- Let's go.

565
01:00:14,157 --> 01:00:15,590
Oh, by the way...

566
01:00:19,437 --> 01:00:21,632
Here, take this, it's yours.

567
01:00:26,477 --> 01:00:28,195
Get back! Get back!

568
01:00:36,197 --> 01:00:41,794
- Do you know what you've done?
- Yes, and I hope that you do, too.

569
01:00:50,037 --> 01:00:52,676
Let my guests pass.

570
01:01:13,237 --> 01:01:17,355
"Therefore, the people, without
class distinction and conditions..."

571
01:01:17,397 --> 01:01:19,706
- But it's...
- Let him finish. - It's okay.

572
01:01:19,757 --> 01:01:22,271
It must mean something, though,
mustn't it?

573
01:01:22,317 --> 01:01:26,151
"... without class distinction and
conditions, ask the powers that be..."

574
01:01:26,197 --> 01:01:30,509
"... for the transfer to another office of
this incapable and conceited official".

575
01:01:40,197 --> 01:01:42,267
Good day.

576
01:01:44,197 --> 01:01:45,789
Nationals.

577
01:01:47,557 --> 01:01:49,309
See that?

578
01:01:50,637 --> 01:01:55,870
- Completely ignored. - You've irritated
the wasp's nest, Judge, be careful.

579
01:01:57,357 --> 01:01:59,632
You're a good man, Don Peppino.

580
01:02:05,397 --> 01:02:07,035
Good day.

581
01:02:10,477 --> 01:02:13,628
That one will come to a bad end,
I assure you of that.

582
01:02:13,677 --> 01:02:16,874
- I saw it from the first day he arrived.
- He's a crazy one alright.

583
01:02:16,917 --> 01:02:19,477
It's better to stay away from him these days.

584
01:02:20,997 --> 01:02:24,307
Excuse me. Excuse me!

585
01:02:28,797 --> 01:02:32,187
Judge! Judge!

586
01:02:32,237 --> 01:02:39,154
- Sorry, I have some very important news...
- Tell me, tell me.

587
01:02:39,197 --> 01:02:42,155
- And calm yourself.
- I am calm, you know?

588
01:02:42,197 --> 01:02:48,545
Tomorrow a niece of mine is coming to stay.
An orphan, poor thing... so you will have to...

589
01:02:48,597 --> 01:02:51,634
- To what, Don FifÃ¬?
- To find another place to stay.

590
01:02:51,677 --> 01:02:55,465
- I'm sorry but it's essential that you...
- Okay!

591
01:02:55,517 --> 01:02:57,633
Don't worry, Don FifÃ¬, I'm going.

592
01:02:57,677 --> 01:03:03,149
Ah, Judge, I almost forgot...
This arrived for you an hour ago.

593
01:03:03,197 --> 01:03:07,907
Angela dropped it off, the maid
that serves the Baroness...

594
01:03:49,637 --> 01:03:53,152
- Miss...
- I have very little time.

595
01:03:53,197 --> 01:03:57,748
I warned you to be careful, but you've
gone and done something crazy.

596
01:03:57,797 --> 01:04:01,028
Crazy and useless,
and now your life is in danger.

597
01:04:01,077 --> 01:04:05,787
Something terrible might happen
to you at any moment, you know?

598
01:04:05,837 --> 01:04:08,715
I tried to find out what
they're planning for you...

599
01:04:08,757 --> 01:04:11,590
... but nobody is talking,
they're keeping it to themselves.

600
01:04:11,637 --> 01:04:14,754
Why did you come to inform me?

601
01:04:16,597 --> 01:04:21,113
I know that with you it's useless,
by now I know what you're like.

602
01:04:21,157 --> 01:04:25,594
- You would rather die than let...
- No, that's not what I was asking.

603
01:04:25,637 --> 01:04:28,390
And you know it.

604
01:04:28,437 --> 01:04:32,555
You went out of your way for me,
you eavesdropped, spied...

605
01:04:32,597 --> 01:04:36,636
Ever since that first night
when I arrived, tired, discouraged...

606
01:04:36,677 --> 01:04:38,952
... and I heard you playing...

607
01:04:38,997 --> 01:04:43,275
... you have been my only comfort
in this hostile and insidious place.

608
01:04:43,317 --> 01:04:49,074
We've only spoken two times but
you've made me feel... less alone.

609
01:04:49,117 --> 01:04:51,950
And I dared to believe that
you somehow felt the same way.

610
01:04:51,997 --> 01:04:58,470
- I knew it, Teresa...
- No! We could never be together.

611
01:04:58,917 --> 01:05:01,112
Good evening.

612
01:05:25,637 --> 01:05:27,275
What do you think?

613
01:05:31,957 --> 01:05:33,231
And you?

614
01:05:35,317 --> 01:05:36,989
You?

615
01:05:41,597 --> 01:05:43,349
And you...

616
01:05:47,997 --> 01:05:49,874
And you?

617
01:05:51,717 --> 01:05:53,230
You!

618
01:06:05,197 --> 01:06:06,755
Good.

619
01:06:09,797 --> 01:06:14,109
- You have decided. - And who will do it?
- Tano Gallinella. - But he's in prison.

620
01:06:14,157 --> 01:06:17,832
The judge has disrespected him,
so it's up to him to deliver justice.

621
01:06:17,877 --> 01:06:21,665
I leave this evening for Palermo,
within a few days Gallinella will be out.

622
01:06:21,717 --> 01:06:24,709
They haven't testified and
the evidence is insufficient.

623
01:06:24,757 --> 01:06:28,067
Let's move on to Paolino.
What do you think we should do?

624
01:06:33,597 --> 01:06:40,116
- Paolino is working for the judge,
spying for him. - Are you sure?

625
01:06:40,157 --> 01:06:46,505
I know that it was him who
recognised the medallion.

626
01:06:46,557 --> 01:06:52,712
- How do you know? - I heard him
boasting about it... to Bastianedda.

627
01:06:52,757 --> 01:06:55,396
Paolino is just a kid,
he doesn't know what he's saying.

628
01:06:55,437 --> 01:06:59,908
He's a snake: a snake that lives to spy.

629
01:07:05,477 --> 01:07:07,513
We must be certain.

630
01:07:07,557 --> 01:07:09,787
Diego will look into it...

631
01:07:09,837 --> 01:07:14,467
... and if Ciccio is telling the truth,
then Paolino will be made to pay.

632
01:08:01,357 --> 01:08:06,351
It's La Scaniota! It's La Scaniota!

633
01:08:09,037 --> 01:08:13,792
- You're too late! - They'll be done by now.
- Better prepare the confetti, La Scaniota!

634
01:08:13,837 --> 01:08:19,707
- That girl is crazy!
- She's done well, she's done well!

635
01:08:19,757 --> 01:08:22,430
Open up! You disgrace!

636
01:08:22,477 --> 01:08:27,267
- You devils! Open up!
- You should let them marry, La Scaniota!

637
01:08:32,717 --> 01:08:37,837
- They've already had their honeymoon!
- Now you have to let them get married!

638
01:08:37,877 --> 01:08:40,391
And you thought she would choose Ciccio!

639
01:08:40,437 --> 01:08:44,066
Get out of here, you bastards!

640
01:08:44,117 --> 01:08:46,950
She wanted her to choose Ciccio!

641
01:09:06,517 --> 01:09:09,509
Stop! What are you doing? Stop!

642
01:09:14,597 --> 01:09:15,950
Scared?

643
01:09:18,757 --> 01:09:22,716
Are you mad? Stop, I say! Stop!

644
01:09:39,117 --> 01:09:43,030
- Roughly around 10 million, roughly...
- Is that all?!

645
01:09:43,077 --> 01:09:46,911
Naturally the court will appoint an expert,
probably an examiner.

646
01:09:46,957 --> 01:09:49,551
- Therefore, the sum...
- Forget it!

647
01:09:49,597 --> 01:09:52,270
I wouldn't be able to pay 10 million,
not even if I sold my soul.

648
01:09:52,317 --> 01:09:56,151
But that's the way it is, you must
reopen the mine, reactivate it...

649
01:09:56,197 --> 01:09:59,906
In the report on the mine must be sent
to the government, written by the mayor...

650
01:09:59,957 --> 01:10:04,109
- But I pay the mayor! - What could he
have done? The judge never took eyes off him.

651
01:10:04,157 --> 01:10:05,875
So anyway, we reopen it.

652
01:10:05,917 --> 01:10:10,911
Of course, the order is addressed to
the proprietor, the Baroness, meaning you...

653
01:10:10,957 --> 01:10:14,506
I ran the mine, so I will be made
to answer for the sold machinery...

654
01:10:14,557 --> 01:10:17,867
... the funds that disappeared,
etcetera, etcetera...

655
01:10:17,917 --> 01:10:22,308
Yes, but you must have some way to
get 10 million, otherwise...

656
01:10:22,357 --> 01:10:25,827
- Prison!
- A lawsuit.

657
01:10:25,877 --> 01:10:30,553
Oh, no, for the love of God! You're my
lawyer, so advise me what to do.

658
01:10:31,237 --> 01:10:35,276
I can only do so much, obviously,
because legally speaking...

659
01:10:35,317 --> 01:10:39,230
You could secure the judge's transfer...

660
01:10:39,277 --> 01:10:42,587
.. or, seeing that he arrested
Gallinella, convince Boss Turi to...

661
01:10:44,037 --> 01:10:46,073
Boss Turi is going senile.

662
01:10:46,557 --> 01:10:49,355
But the judge is very much aware,
because I...

663
01:10:51,397 --> 01:10:53,547
... I'm not senile just yet!

664
01:11:10,797 --> 01:11:13,152
Good day, Judge.

665
01:11:15,357 --> 01:11:19,236
- I'm not sure if you deserve a greeting
anymore, Gallinella. - I'm free, see?

666
01:11:19,797 --> 01:11:22,595
Free because I didn't do it.

667
01:11:22,637 --> 01:11:25,390
Then if you're free,
it must mean that I'm wrong.

668
01:11:25,437 --> 01:11:28,554
This is what the laws are for,
Gallinella.

669
01:11:28,597 --> 01:11:34,911
So... good day to you, too.
And a packet of cigarettes, please.

670
01:11:38,357 --> 01:11:42,828
I won't take your money. I've been waiting
to hear a reply like that for a long time!

671
01:11:42,877 --> 01:11:45,794
- I just tell it how it is.
- Let me get you a drink.

672
01:11:45,805 --> 01:11:47,268
No, Don Peppino,
don't put yourself out.

673
01:11:47,317 --> 01:11:50,275
It's nothing. An occasion like this
deserves to be celebrated.

674
01:11:50,317 --> 01:11:54,071
- You should be mayor.
- Someone bold like yourself.

675
01:11:54,117 --> 01:11:57,553
Sir, may I? To your health, we hope
you're here for another 100 years.

676
01:11:57,597 --> 01:12:00,794
- You rejuvenate us all.
- To your health. - To good health!

677
01:12:00,837 --> 01:12:05,149
- Judge, Sir! Sorry, but is it true?
- Is what true?

678
01:12:05,197 --> 01:12:08,633
About the mine. They're saying that
he'll be sued if the mine doesn't reopen.

679
01:12:08,677 --> 01:12:10,110
Yes, but don't get your hopes up.

680
01:12:10,157 --> 01:12:13,911
He's being sued, and the mine might
well reopen, but we must wait and hope.

681
01:12:13,957 --> 01:12:16,630
- Yes, but we're going back to work.
- The mine is opening again.

682
01:12:16,677 --> 01:12:19,828
Everyone in the town is saying so.
Back to work and it's all thanks to you.

683
01:12:19,877 --> 01:12:24,348
- God bless you. - Yes, thank you.
But it's still early, nothing is certain.

684
01:12:24,397 --> 01:12:27,150
- Judge, Sir...
- Excuse me.

685
01:12:28,157 --> 01:12:33,026
- They brought this from the Baron's
house. Excuse me... - Just a moment.

686
01:12:34,037 --> 01:12:38,474
I think... think that...
The envelope was open, so anyway...

687
01:12:38,517 --> 01:12:41,987
- So you read what was written.
- Oh, no, I'd never do such a thing!

688
01:12:42,037 --> 01:12:44,471
- But I saw that there was a card and so...
- Here!

689
01:12:47,037 --> 01:12:50,268
- No! - Yes.
- He's inviting you to a party.

690
01:12:50,317 --> 01:12:53,275
- The Baron is inviting you to a party.
- Yes, it seems so. Well?

691
01:12:53,317 --> 01:12:58,391
Nothing, I was just thinking, it's an
honour for you... deserved, I mean.

692
01:12:58,437 --> 01:13:03,033
- I see that this matter with the
mine is already... - Is already what?

693
01:13:03,077 --> 01:13:07,229
Ah, I almost forgot, that niece
of mine that was coming to stay...

694
01:13:07,277 --> 01:13:11,065
- Won't be coming. - Yes, she changed
her mind. But how did you know?

695
01:13:11,117 --> 01:13:14,632
- Well, it was just a guess.
- So you'll be staying with me.

696
01:13:14,677 --> 01:13:17,475
- Until the next niece turns up.
- What do you mean...

697
01:13:17,517 --> 01:13:23,194
You can stay with me for as long as you like,
in my beautiful, comfortable house...

698
01:13:23,237 --> 01:13:26,912
... with one window that opens onto the
street and another onto the Baron's garden.

699
01:13:26,957 --> 01:13:31,872
You know, I can see the garden
from my window as well...

700
01:13:31,917 --> 01:13:34,112
... right into the Baroness' garden...

701
01:13:34,157 --> 01:13:38,594
... and I often look out in the
evenings to get a bit of fresh air.

702
01:13:38,637 --> 01:13:40,673
If you'll excuse me...

703
01:14:07,677 --> 01:14:11,590
- Well done, Judge! - Good evening.
- I'm pleased to see you back here.

704
01:14:11,637 --> 01:14:15,471
Come, make yourself comfortable. I'll
finally introduce you to our society.

705
01:14:16,677 --> 01:14:22,468
Dear friends, may I introduce
Mr Guido Schiavi, our new judge.

706
01:14:23,917 --> 01:14:27,432
- Congratulations, Judge, finally
you're one of us. - Thank you.

707
01:14:27,477 --> 01:14:32,267
- My wife. - In the town
all they do is talk about you.

708
01:14:32,317 --> 01:14:35,946
- Oh, really? - They told us
that you were a terrible man.

709
01:14:35,997 --> 01:14:40,627
Well, at the start, when people don't know each
other, there's always some misunderstanding.

710
01:14:40,677 --> 01:14:45,387
Of course, but all that is now over
and we're happy to welcome you among us.

711
01:14:45,437 --> 01:14:48,509
This calls for a toast! Music, please.

712
01:14:48,557 --> 01:14:51,913
To the good health and harmony
of everyone in the room.

713
01:14:57,077 --> 01:14:59,113
- For you.
- Thank you.

714
01:15:02,317 --> 01:15:04,672
- Evening, Baroness.
- Good evening.

715
01:15:05,237 --> 01:15:08,912
- Are you not drinking?
- Thank you. - Angela.

716
01:15:12,517 --> 01:15:17,068
- What's going on?
- I received an invite. - Yes, I know.

717
01:15:17,117 --> 01:15:20,234
But be careful, all these smiles
are frightening me.

718
01:15:20,277 --> 01:15:23,792
- Listen, there's something else...
- Here we are.

719
01:15:32,637 --> 01:15:35,868
My wife adores music,
but I can't stand it myself.

720
01:15:35,917 --> 01:15:39,830
As soon as I hear her playing in one room,
I feel the need to move to another.

721
01:15:39,877 --> 01:15:42,789
Come, I wanted to have a small chat with you.

722
01:15:49,957 --> 01:15:52,107
Make yourself comfortable.

723
01:16:01,077 --> 01:16:04,035
- A drink? - No, thank you.
What's this all about, Baron?

724
01:16:04,077 --> 01:16:08,116
Please, sit down.
Then let us get straight down to business.

725
01:16:08,237 --> 01:16:11,707
You saw this evening how people
have changed their opinion of you...

726
01:16:11,757 --> 01:16:13,349
... this is because of me.

727
01:16:13,397 --> 01:16:16,275
For now you have won your
case to reopen the mine.

728
01:16:16,317 --> 01:16:20,105
Of course I have an appeal in the process
and am certain that I will win in the end.

729
01:16:20,157 --> 01:16:24,275
- But I can't see why we can't be friends.
- That's all I'm asking for.

730
01:16:24,317 --> 01:16:27,832
- I came looking for your co-operation.
- Exactly, co-operation.

731
01:16:27,877 --> 01:16:32,951
- See, you help me and I help you.
- Yes, but... - Please, let me finish...

732
01:16:33,317 --> 01:16:38,186
Just the other day one of us was talking
about the increasing cost of living.

733
01:16:38,237 --> 01:16:42,310
To live well these days,
you need to own rivers of cash.

734
01:16:42,357 --> 01:16:45,269
- Are you sure you wouldn't like a drink?
- No, thank you.

735
01:16:49,957 --> 01:16:51,834
As I was saying, the cost of living...

736
01:16:51,877 --> 01:16:55,665
I can't remember who, but someone was
complaining about the government wages.

737
01:16:55,717 --> 01:16:58,106
The Chancellor, yes.
It must have been him, the poor man.

738
01:16:58,157 --> 01:17:01,433
It's terrible that the government
pays its staff so poorly.

739
01:17:01,477 --> 01:17:05,186
Besides, we know how difficult it is
to justify extra spending...

740
01:17:05,237 --> 01:17:09,150
So someone, I can't remember who,
mentioned...

741
01:17:09,197 --> 01:17:14,317
... that in some cases there are funds,
let's call them extra-government bonuses...

742
01:17:14,357 --> 01:17:18,953
... that thanks to which, even the
most modest of salaries can balloon...

743
01:17:18,997 --> 01:17:21,465
... things suddenly become,
in a word: possible.

744
01:17:21,517 --> 01:17:23,633
And it's right, more than right.

745
01:17:23,677 --> 01:17:27,352
- Don't you find, Judge?
- No.

746
01:17:30,757 --> 01:17:33,510
- This was what you had to tell me?
- Young man, let's be clear about this...

747
01:17:33,557 --> 01:17:37,755
- I thought we were clear already?
- No! Obviously not enough!

748
01:17:37,797 --> 01:17:42,154
Only yesterday I received a letter,
a letter regarding my wife.

749
01:17:42,197 --> 01:17:44,074
Read it!

750
01:17:51,837 --> 01:17:55,750
- There really is no way to save you.
- Enough of your preaching, Reverend!

751
01:17:55,797 --> 01:18:00,268
As you see, none of us stay clean for long.
We're all the same!

752
01:18:02,237 --> 01:18:04,546
Then I will not reopen the mine!

753
01:18:05,277 --> 01:18:09,065
And you? How much do you want to
walk away from this matter?

754
01:18:09,117 --> 01:18:13,474
How much do you want to leave me in peace?
And to leave my wife in peace!

755
01:18:28,077 --> 01:18:34,994
- Guido, what happened? - We must not
see each other again, Teresa. Ever again.

756
01:18:35,037 --> 01:18:36,789
Guido...

757
01:18:39,877 --> 01:18:46,066
Forgive me, Teresa.
I will never forget you. Goodbye.

758
01:18:46,117 --> 01:18:51,749
Judge, the prosecutor has arrived
from Palermo and wants to see you.

759
01:18:51,797 --> 01:18:55,267
- Where is he?
- At your house, Judge.

760
01:19:05,917 --> 01:19:07,714
Good evening, Teresa.

761
01:20:03,077 --> 01:20:06,911
- What was that?
- Nothing, nothing, just a poacher.

762
01:20:10,397 --> 01:20:13,753
Baroness, don't go out there,
it might be dangerous.

763
01:20:33,997 --> 01:20:35,988
Close the door!

764
01:20:40,757 --> 01:20:43,510
- You missed him, didn't you?
- He was walking too fast...

765
01:20:43,557 --> 01:20:46,913
You damn imbecile!
Now what do you want from me?

766
01:20:46,957 --> 01:20:49,027
If you even breath a word
of this to anyone...

767
01:20:49,077 --> 01:20:53,434
- Did he see you? - No. - So what are
you afraid of? It was an order from the mafia.

768
01:20:53,477 --> 01:20:57,186
- Nobody will suspect us.
- Yes, but the mafia...

769
01:21:02,117 --> 01:21:05,996
- Get out!
- Murderer.

770
01:21:06,037 --> 01:21:08,949
- Murderer!
- Be quiet! Will you be quiet?

771
01:21:08,997 --> 01:21:13,468
Murderer! No, I want to scream it for
everyone to hear! Murderer! Murderer!

772
01:21:29,557 --> 01:21:32,310
Get out of here, you! Out!

773
01:21:39,317 --> 01:21:41,706
Judge, the workers are
on their way to the mine.

774
01:21:41,757 --> 01:21:44,510
Word spread that the case is won
and that work will start again soon.

775
01:21:44,557 --> 01:21:48,311
Call the marshal, hurry. We must
stop them on the road to the mine.

776
01:22:01,277 --> 01:22:02,426
Stop!

777
01:22:03,237 --> 01:22:08,595
Stop, I tell you! You're jeopardising
everything! Stop! Wait!

778
01:22:08,637 --> 01:22:12,596
- Get back, that's an order!
- What order? - The case is won.

779
01:22:12,637 --> 01:22:16,391
- They already told us. - We're going
back to work. - Everyone knows by now.

780
01:22:16,437 --> 01:22:20,271
- Get back!
- To your homes! Orders from the judge!

781
01:22:20,317 --> 01:22:22,911
- Orders from the judge?
- Why?

782
01:22:22,957 --> 01:22:27,075
I knew he was in with that lot,
that's why he was at the Baron's party.

783
01:22:27,717 --> 01:22:29,355
There you go, done.

784
01:22:33,037 --> 01:22:36,950
- How does it look? - Just a shock.
If you need me, I'm at your disposal.

785
01:22:36,997 --> 01:22:38,794
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

786
01:22:45,277 --> 01:22:49,634
- You know why I've come, don't you?
- I have an idea.

787
01:22:49,677 --> 01:22:52,635
There are two types of young magistrate...

788
01:22:52,677 --> 01:22:56,795
.. those that are broken down
and those that stand and fight.

789
01:22:56,837 --> 01:22:59,635
- I belong to the second category.
- Exactly.

790
01:23:01,877 --> 01:23:06,428
Stop! Get back! Get back!
Get back! Get back!

791
01:23:09,837 --> 01:23:11,987
We want to work!

792
01:23:14,317 --> 01:23:16,877
Come on, sit back down.

793
01:23:17,277 --> 01:23:20,155
Excellency! Excellency!

794
01:23:20,197 --> 01:23:27,194
- They're knocking by house down.
- Get me the marshal. - Yes. Marshal!

795
01:23:27,237 --> 01:23:29,831
That the atmosphere is always going to
be hostile, that's a fact...

796
01:23:29,877 --> 01:23:32,027
... but it's also a fact that you,
my esteemed colleague...

797
01:23:32,077 --> 01:23:35,865
... haven't made any friends or allies
in the process, everyone is against you.

798
01:23:35,917 --> 01:23:38,750
Everyone, poor and rich, good and bad.

799
01:23:38,797 --> 01:23:42,949
You have just cause, but it's clear
that this isn't the place for you.

800
01:23:45,157 --> 01:23:48,115
- You called, Excellency.
- So, will this racket never end?

801
01:23:48,157 --> 01:23:51,354
- There are only a few of us, Excellency.
- Come on, don't make excuses!

802
01:23:51,397 --> 01:23:54,833
- Fire your gun in the air!
- Of course, Excellency.

803
01:23:56,077 --> 01:23:59,274
That there is a man you should
recommend for a promotion.

804
01:24:00,477 --> 01:24:03,549
I was thinking of you, not the marshal.

805
01:24:03,597 --> 01:24:07,226
See, from a human point of view
I can't praise you enough.

806
01:24:09,557 --> 01:24:12,230
Get back! Get back!

807
01:24:12,277 --> 01:24:16,031
- Enough! - We want to work!
- Miss, return to your house.

808
01:24:25,117 --> 01:24:28,075
Though, I repeat, this is
not the place for you anymore.

809
01:24:28,117 --> 01:24:32,235
I won't berate you because there's
absolutely no reason to.

810
01:24:32,277 --> 01:24:35,155
You heard the miners before.

811
01:24:35,197 --> 01:24:39,554
Under these conditions, I can't do
anything else but order your transfer...

812
01:24:39,597 --> 01:24:41,394
... and as soon as possible.

813
01:24:41,437 --> 01:24:47,592
A transfer. You realise that to transfer
would mean victory for the mafia...

814
01:24:47,637 --> 01:24:50,197
... that with my transfer the reputation
and influence of the Government..

815
01:24:50,237 --> 01:24:52,467
... would be most definitely
lost in this place...

816
01:24:52,517 --> 01:24:55,827
... and that my successor would
have absolutely no power here.

817
01:24:55,877 --> 01:25:01,190
I'm sure you've considered all of this,
and yet you're still telling me to leave.

818
01:25:01,237 --> 01:25:04,388
I cannot, I would prefer
to leave the career itself.

819
01:25:04,437 --> 01:25:07,668
It's useless to keep trying to
break down walls with one's head.

820
01:25:07,717 --> 01:25:12,347
I give up...
I will hand in my resignation, instead.

821
01:25:12,397 --> 01:25:16,470
I understand how you must be feeling,
but please think about it before deciding.

822
01:25:16,517 --> 01:25:20,908
- I've already decided.
- Goodnight. - Goodnight.

823
01:25:42,717 --> 01:25:44,628
Guido.

824
01:25:48,077 --> 01:25:49,669
Teresa...

825
01:25:56,877 --> 01:26:03,510
- I'm free, Teresa. I'm leaving.
- Take me away, I'll come away with you.

826
01:26:23,757 --> 01:26:27,386
Well then, Chancellor,
finally you're rid of me.

827
01:26:27,437 --> 01:26:32,352
What are you saying, Judge?
I feel... inconsolable.

828
01:26:32,397 --> 01:26:34,592
I can see that...

829
01:26:34,637 --> 01:26:37,390
Wish better fortune to my successor.

830
01:26:45,917 --> 01:26:50,832
Thank you for everything, Marshal.
I'm sorry to leave you with this mess.

831
01:26:50,877 --> 01:26:55,189
It's good that you're leaving, Judge,
you're still so young...

832
01:26:55,237 --> 01:26:59,594
DonÂt worry about me, nothing to be done,
everything will go back to the way it was.

833
01:26:59,637 --> 01:27:03,346
A shame...
I felt important with you by my side.

834
01:27:10,597 --> 01:27:12,349
Paolino.

835
01:27:13,477 --> 01:27:16,071
- Is it true that you're going, Judge?
- I'm on my way now.

836
01:27:16,117 --> 01:27:19,996
Well done, Paolino, I'm happy you
came to say goodbye. How is your girl?

837
01:27:20,037 --> 01:27:23,188
She's just outside, ashamed to come in.

838
01:27:31,877 --> 01:27:34,345
Hey! Hey, Bastianedda!

839
01:27:37,757 --> 01:27:39,873
Bastianedda, come here!

840
01:27:40,917 --> 01:27:43,033
Don't be silly, come here.

841
01:27:46,917 --> 01:27:49,272
Bastianedda!

842
01:27:52,477 --> 01:27:54,468
Give her a kiss for me.

843
01:27:55,437 --> 01:27:59,430
- I hope you're not jealous, eh?
- Of your, no.

844
01:27:59,477 --> 01:28:04,392
- Whatever happened to Ciccio Messana?
- Thank God, nobody has seen him since.

845
01:28:06,637 --> 01:28:10,425
Well, goodbye Paolino.
I'll be sure to write.

846
01:28:11,557 --> 01:28:15,596
- And let me know when you get married.
- Goodbye.

847
01:29:09,877 --> 01:29:12,869
Judge! Judge, Sir!

848
01:29:17,517 --> 01:29:21,635
- What is it now?
- A murder.

849
01:29:21,677 --> 01:29:23,872
What does that matter to me, Marshal?

850
01:29:23,917 --> 01:29:27,273
I'm finished with this place now,
hand it over to my successor.

851
01:29:28,597 --> 01:29:30,428
Who?

852
01:29:34,157 --> 01:29:37,388
- Who?!
- Paolino.

853
01:29:37,437 --> 01:29:41,430
Down there... dead.

854
01:30:57,437 --> 01:31:00,668
- What's going on?
- Have they gone mad?

855
01:31:53,957 --> 01:31:56,232
What's all this ringing?

856
01:32:19,797 --> 01:32:25,429
Now that you're all here,
I should tell you that this is a trial.

857
01:32:25,477 --> 01:32:28,355
Half an hour ago,
shot by a double-barrel shotgun...

858
01:32:28,397 --> 01:32:30,991
... the corpse of Paolino was discovered.

859
01:32:31,037 --> 01:32:35,394
He was 17 years old and
has never hurt anybody.

860
01:32:35,437 --> 01:32:39,555
You killed him, instead of
helping me carry out my task...

861
01:32:39,597 --> 01:32:42,589
... you have treated me as a threat to
your world of laziness and ignorance.

862
01:32:42,637 --> 01:32:45,595
You killed him, you who have done
nothing but create problems in my task.

863
01:32:45,637 --> 01:32:48,026
You, who have opposed me if
and whenever you got the chance.

864
01:32:48,077 --> 01:32:50,227
Who have scorned and ignored me...

865
01:32:50,277 --> 01:32:53,314
... accused me of being a disturber
of your peace!

866
01:32:53,357 --> 01:32:57,066
You, men and women, who have
cowered in fear...

867
01:32:57,117 --> 01:33:00,951
... even in front of those who are
trying to catch your child's murderers.

868
01:33:00,997 --> 01:33:05,229
You have broken the law, even
when it was put there to protect you!

869
01:33:05,277 --> 01:33:07,871
You have killed Paolino
because you prevented me...

870
01:33:07,917 --> 01:33:12,035
... from administering justice and from
encouraging people to respect the law.

871
01:33:12,077 --> 01:33:15,672
Of course, only one of you has
actually shot the boy...

872
01:33:15,717 --> 01:33:17,708
... one who is perhaps listening
to me right now...

873
01:33:17,757 --> 01:33:21,830
... and one who will never be punished
because he is protected by your fear.

874
01:33:21,877 --> 01:33:25,347
You, men of the mafia,
and you, Boss Passalacqua...

875
01:33:25,397 --> 01:33:28,036
... you, who are in your own
way wise and just...

876
01:33:28,077 --> 01:33:31,308
... you, too have preferred your
bloody and cutthroat laws...

877
01:33:31,357 --> 01:33:35,714
... that condemn he who disrespects
and protect he who does the condemning...

878
01:33:35,757 --> 01:33:42,105
... laws that allow you to live and
slaughter one another like beasts

879
01:33:42,157 --> 01:33:44,193
Now I've finished.

880
01:33:44,237 --> 01:33:47,388
For the first time since I arrived here,
we're speaking face to face.

881
01:33:47,437 --> 01:33:50,554
I know very well, by now,
what to expect from you.

882
01:33:50,597 --> 01:33:53,316
And you now know what
to expect from me.

883
01:33:53,357 --> 01:33:59,990
Because I will remain here, in this town
for as long as it is necessary...

884
01:34:00,037 --> 01:34:04,076
... and will do my duty until the
very end, with or without you.

885
01:34:04,117 --> 01:34:06,153
Until a blow from a shotgun...

886
01:34:06,197 --> 01:34:09,234
... sends me to keep Paolino company.

887
01:34:09,277 --> 01:34:11,472
Isn't that right, Boss Passalacqua?

888
01:34:11,997 --> 01:34:14,636
You have spoken harshly, Judge.

889
01:34:14,677 --> 01:34:18,306
More harshly than anyone here
has every spoken before.

890
01:34:18,357 --> 01:34:20,871
But to me you have also spoken justly.

891
01:34:20,917 --> 01:34:25,866
My men and I came here today,
not to listen to your words...

892
01:34:25,917 --> 01:34:28,306
... but to punish Paolino's killer...

893
01:34:28,357 --> 01:34:31,429
... and deliver justice swiftly,
in our own way.

894
01:34:31,477 --> 01:34:34,230
But I was thinking of my
son while I was listening...

895
01:34:34,277 --> 01:34:37,952
... and thought that he would have
been proud to hear you speak like this.

896
01:34:37,997 --> 01:34:44,186
I will tell my friends that the time has
arrived to return to the law once again.

897
01:34:44,237 --> 01:34:48,150
Perhaps all of us killed Paolino in some
small way, but just one man shot him.

898
01:34:48,197 --> 01:34:52,634
And I will deliver him to Sir to be
tried under the laws of the State.

899
01:34:53,037 --> 01:34:54,789
Go on.

900
01:35:17,597 --> 01:35:22,113
Francesco Messana, you are under
arrest in the name of the law.

901
01:35:35,397 --> 01:35:38,070
In the name of the law...
