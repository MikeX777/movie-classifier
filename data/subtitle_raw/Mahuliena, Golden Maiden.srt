12
00:02:53,367 --> 00:02:56,086
Wake up! The king is coming!

13
00:02:58,927 --> 00:03:02,237
What if they don't come this time?

14
00:03:02,327 --> 00:03:04,921
They always come at solstice.

15
00:03:05,567 --> 00:03:07,046
l would drive them off!

16
00:03:07,127 --> 00:03:11,120
But we would need a different king.

17
00:03:11,407 --> 00:03:16,037
l wonder what you would do
if you were him, you sissy.

18
00:03:16,247 --> 00:03:18,761
You're a sissy!

19
00:03:50,087 --> 00:03:52,647
Get up, Ján!

20
00:03:52,847 --> 00:03:54,838
What's going on?

21
00:03:54,927 --> 00:03:58,556
You and the Prince must leave now!

22
00:03:58,647 --> 00:03:59,796
Are they here? Are they coming?

23
00:03:59,887 --> 00:04:05,837
Not yet. But l'll feel better
knowing you are far away.

24
00:04:06,007 --> 00:04:09,397
Come what may, stay away
at least a week.

25
00:04:09,487 --> 00:04:12,081
l know, sir. As usual.

26
00:04:19,007 --> 00:04:21,601
l heard a little owl last night.

27
00:04:24,367 --> 00:04:26,676
l hope it doesn't mean bad luck.

28
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:30,476
Since when are you superstitious?
Stop that!

29
00:04:33,207 --> 00:04:34,401
Better hurry!

30
00:04:35,687 --> 00:04:39,202
Are you... still here?

31
00:04:40,567 --> 00:04:43,639
Do you not feel sorry for your father?

32
00:04:45,367 --> 00:04:49,645
l didn't sleep from the pain all night.

33
00:04:49,727 --> 00:04:52,605
You know l can only be cured
with the fat of a white otter.

34
00:04:52,687 --> 00:04:54,962
Why do you not go then?

35
00:04:55,047 --> 00:04:57,322
You must be patient, Father.

36
00:04:59,247 --> 00:05:01,636
Last year, it took us a week
to trace one.

37
00:05:01,727 --> 00:05:05,083
l know, that's why you need to leave now!

38
00:05:09,607 --> 00:05:11,643
Have you heard the King?
Get moving!

39
00:05:11,727 --> 00:05:13,877
You are always keeping us up.

40
00:05:14,767 --> 00:05:16,723
ls it possible?

41
00:05:18,127 --> 00:05:20,243
l bet that it will be me who'll catch it!

42
00:05:20,327 --> 00:05:23,444
We shall see about that.
The loser will be the horse!

43
00:05:24,287 --> 00:05:27,245
lt's a deal. Let me try right away.

44
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,238
Let's go!

45
00:05:38,727 --> 00:05:42,800
Go now. While there's time.

46
00:07:23,207 --> 00:07:25,038
l don't understand.

47
00:07:25,127 --> 00:07:26,560
We've been panning for gold for ages

48
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:30,401
but what good does it do to us?
- What would you want?

49
00:07:31,287 --> 00:07:35,644
What a dumb question! You can have
everything if you have gold.

50
00:07:35,847 --> 00:07:38,759
That's true but we don't lack anything.

51
00:07:38,847 --> 00:07:42,806
Our king saves the gold for bad times.

52
00:08:10,327 --> 00:08:13,205
What is it this time?
We need to keep moving.

53
00:08:13,647 --> 00:08:15,683
Look, isn't she beautiful?

54
00:08:16,687 --> 00:08:18,917
Perhaps. But we're not hunting herons.

55
00:08:21,487 --> 00:08:24,285
See, she doesn't trust you.

56
00:08:34,767 --> 00:08:36,997
Can you hear it too?

57
00:08:38,247 --> 00:08:40,966
lt must be a storm coming!

58
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:47,486
Nonsense! There's not a cloud
in the sky!

59
00:08:58,527 --> 00:09:01,166
Let's go! Quick!

60
00:09:02,407 --> 00:09:06,605
Turn it back! What are you doing?
Are you mad?

61
00:09:08,567 --> 00:09:11,479
- You mustn't go there!
- Leave me alone!

62
00:09:16,767 --> 00:09:19,361
Stop! Come back!

63
00:09:50,247 --> 00:09:53,284
The wagon has no coachman.

64
00:09:55,847 --> 00:09:58,680
The horses must have bolted.

65
00:10:00,647 --> 00:10:03,878
You're lying!
They're going to our place.

66
00:10:05,047 --> 00:10:08,596
What for? Where are they coming from?

67
00:10:12,007 --> 00:10:15,363
You know. Tell me!

68
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:20,757
l cannot. l gave my word.

69
00:10:21,407 --> 00:10:25,559
You gave your word to whom?

70
00:10:26,607 --> 00:10:28,837
To the king.

71
00:10:35,687 --> 00:10:38,042
To my father?

72
00:10:52,007 --> 00:10:55,283
Ján! You have promised you wouldn't...

73
00:10:55,367 --> 00:10:57,801
l tried but...

74
00:10:59,647 --> 00:11:01,285
What's going on here, Father?

75
00:11:01,367 --> 00:11:05,838
Well, you had to find out one day.

76
00:11:05,927 --> 00:11:08,441
Find out what?

77
00:11:08,527 --> 00:11:14,716
Every year, we give the gold back
to Lordogold.

78
00:11:15,647 --> 00:11:16,966
We give him our gold?

79
00:11:17,047 --> 00:11:23,236
Yes. We have been doing so since forever.
Every year, at solstice.

80
00:11:25,687 --> 00:11:29,999
l thought you did not have
to know about it yet.

81
00:11:36,287 --> 00:11:39,404
Why is that? Who is Lordogold?

82
00:11:39,487 --> 00:11:42,365
The ruler of all gold!

83
00:11:42,447 --> 00:11:47,202
Other empires give him slaves
for the gold.

84
00:11:47,287 --> 00:11:50,006
But we would not be subjugated.

85
00:11:50,087 --> 00:11:56,526
Even the last of us means more
than this pile of gold!

86
00:11:57,207 --> 00:11:59,437
How can you endure such injustice?

87
00:11:59,527 --> 00:12:02,087
Have you no courage to stand up to him?

88
00:12:02,807 --> 00:12:06,243
You have gained the gold with
your labour, it belongs to you!

89
00:12:07,087 --> 00:12:12,605
Be quiet, son, or you will bring us
to an evil end!

90
00:12:12,687 --> 00:12:16,362
Nobody can oppose his fate,
not even the king.

91
00:12:16,447 --> 00:12:20,599
- What can possibly happen?
- Only king Lordogold knows.

92
00:12:22,207 --> 00:12:24,767
These are all just excuses.

93
00:12:24,847 --> 00:12:27,680
You have never opposed him,
have you?

94
00:12:27,767 --> 00:12:30,759
You are young, you don't understand.

95
00:12:31,367 --> 00:12:34,564
You will learn everything with time

96
00:12:34,967 --> 00:12:38,164
- just like me and my father,
and all our forefathers did.

97
00:12:38,687 --> 00:12:44,284
Majesty, we'll do what you decide
but we'll serve Lordogold no more!

98
00:12:44,367 --> 00:12:46,483
Yes! Yes!

99
00:12:47,207 --> 00:12:50,404
That's madness!
You must not allow that, sir!

100
00:12:50,487 --> 00:12:52,478
That is enough!

101
00:12:52,927 --> 00:12:57,364
lf we begin to quarrel,
we shall be lost.

102
00:12:58,767 --> 00:13:03,966
Load the carts!
They must not leave empty.

103
00:13:04,927 --> 00:13:11,366
All right. But we won't send
what Lordogold expects.

104
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:37,078
Manure!

105
00:13:39,687 --> 00:13:41,279
We have plenty of that!

106
00:13:41,567 --> 00:13:43,239
Let's do it!

107
00:13:45,207 --> 00:13:47,880
We'll give them enough!

108
00:13:51,087 --> 00:13:52,998
Here you are!

109
00:14:26,727 --> 00:14:30,163
- l have waited for this for years.
- Not only you.

110
00:16:09,007 --> 00:16:13,205
Mahuliena... the golden maiden!

111
00:16:17,527 --> 00:16:18,755
Stop it!

112
00:16:19,247 --> 00:16:23,160
l forbid you! You must not!

113
00:16:30,767 --> 00:16:33,042
Father... Father!

114
00:16:38,087 --> 00:16:42,558
lt is my fault.
l should be punished, not you.

115
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:46,602
Enough! Be a man!

116
00:16:47,367 --> 00:16:55,240
May this be a warning that you must
never revolt against Lordogold.

117
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:03,322
- Father...
- Go now.

118
00:17:07,847 --> 00:17:11,522
Ján! Stay here.

119
00:17:12,007 --> 00:17:13,884
The rest of you, leave!

120
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:19,685
Go!

121
00:17:21,927 --> 00:17:26,318
Come here! Closer... to me.

122
00:17:26,887 --> 00:17:31,199
You are like my own son.

123
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:39,282
Therefore l entrust you this crown.

124
00:17:40,847 --> 00:17:42,838
lt's very old.

125
00:17:42,927 --> 00:17:51,244
l inherited it from my father
as he did from his father.

126
00:17:52,687 --> 00:17:56,805
lt has been ours since ancient times.

127
00:18:02,447 --> 00:18:08,443
Cherish and guard it like the apple
of your eye... lt's for my son...

128
00:18:08,527 --> 00:18:11,758
- Yes...
- When he grows up

129
00:18:12,927 --> 00:18:19,480
to be able to use it
for the good of his people,

130
00:18:26,807 --> 00:18:30,595
not for disaster.

131
00:18:31,847 --> 00:18:36,079
lt has great power, you will see.

132
00:18:37,767 --> 00:18:45,082
l'm asking you to stay loyal
to the prince.

133
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:52,517
Do not leave him in good or in bad times

134
00:18:54,407 --> 00:18:59,356
and protect him from the golden maiden.

135
00:18:59,567 --> 00:19:00,966
Mahuliena?

136
00:19:01,047 --> 00:19:03,163
Remember!

137
00:19:03,447 --> 00:19:06,598
You may never reveal

138
00:19:09,287 --> 00:19:15,237
its mysterious power.
lf you do...

139
00:19:16,287 --> 00:19:18,278
What would happen?

140
00:19:18,647 --> 00:19:24,995
lf you do, then you'll be
turned into stone.

141
00:19:25,127 --> 00:19:30,406
- What?
- You shall turn into stone.

142
00:19:32,007 --> 00:19:35,920
Nothing would save you.

143
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:43,005
Nothing but a great sacrifice.

144
00:19:44,847 --> 00:19:47,919
How great a sacrifice?

145
00:19:49,607 --> 00:19:52,679
l do not know.

146
00:19:53,487 --> 00:20:01,121
So far nobody has ever revealed
the secret of the crown.

147
00:20:14,487 --> 00:20:17,843
Your Highness!

148
00:22:02,887 --> 00:22:06,038
Your Majesty!

149
00:22:22,567 --> 00:22:26,606
Here! He is here!

150
00:22:34,487 --> 00:22:37,524
Wake up! Come on!

151
00:22:41,247 --> 00:22:43,477
What happened?

152
00:23:03,167 --> 00:23:05,044
Where is she?

153
00:23:06,207 --> 00:23:08,038
Where is she?

154
00:23:12,647 --> 00:23:13,796
What have you done with her?

155
00:23:14,447 --> 00:23:17,280
With whom? You were alone.

156
00:23:17,367 --> 00:23:20,245
You had fainted.

157
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:26,397
As if the golden maiden had come
to life in my hands.

158
00:23:28,527 --> 00:23:30,836
- Mahuliena.
- Who?

159
00:23:30,927 --> 00:23:35,717
Her golden image.
The river has been bringing it for years.

160
00:23:36,087 --> 00:23:38,965
Does she live by the river?

161
00:23:39,447 --> 00:23:43,645
Forget her. Many had searched
for her never to return.

162
00:23:46,407 --> 00:23:49,365
Now you need to think of how to rule.

163
00:23:49,607 --> 00:23:52,724
Remember, you are the king now.

164
00:23:53,607 --> 00:23:56,758
That is impossible!

165
00:23:57,767 --> 00:24:02,761
Do you not understand
Lordogold is behind this all?

166
00:24:05,327 --> 00:24:09,798
- What? - His power is said
to be in the golden statue.

167
00:24:16,607 --> 00:24:22,239
Good. l'll go to him
and take her with me.

168
00:25:33,847 --> 00:25:35,917
Look, he's staggering!

169
00:25:37,127 --> 00:25:42,155
No wonder. l have not stood
on the ground for a week.

170
00:25:43,127 --> 00:25:46,915
Do not make excuses!
You have something to drink in the sack!

171
00:25:48,087 --> 00:25:51,477
No, l have nothing there.

172
00:25:55,927 --> 00:25:57,918
We have to look.

173
00:26:00,407 --> 00:26:01,920
- Leave me alone!
- Selfish man!

174
00:26:02,007 --> 00:26:04,441
- Let me be!
- He doesn't want to share!

175
00:26:04,567 --> 00:26:06,478
Let go!

176
00:26:06,567 --> 00:26:11,846
- Show us what you're hiding!
- You'll get a drink too.

177
00:26:11,927 --> 00:26:14,122
Let me be! Let go!

178
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:17,725
Let go!

179
00:26:23,087 --> 00:26:24,236
Nothing.

180
00:26:24,327 --> 00:26:27,285
- Nothing but junk.
- Give me it!

181
00:26:32,087 --> 00:26:35,875
l knew that. Ján cannot lie.

182
00:26:39,047 --> 00:26:40,639
Let's go to sleep.

183
00:27:34,807 --> 00:27:38,083
Get up! We must get out of here!

184
00:27:38,327 --> 00:27:40,363
lt's going to fall! Quick!

185
00:27:41,767 --> 00:27:44,565
Get up! Move!
A storm is coming!

186
00:27:44,647 --> 00:27:46,797
Come on!

187
00:27:47,327 --> 00:27:49,716
lt will kill us!

188
00:28:24,407 --> 00:28:28,036
Don't worry, the two of us will be faster.

189
00:28:28,127 --> 00:28:31,119
Perhaps, but it's harder to defend ourselves.

190
00:28:33,047 --> 00:28:37,837
Don't say that. We can manage ourselves.
Let's go!

191
00:29:29,447 --> 00:29:32,166
Wait! Give me a hand!

192
00:29:35,847 --> 00:29:37,644
l can't!

193
00:29:41,927 --> 00:29:44,521
l'm stuck!

194
00:29:44,607 --> 00:29:47,121
Damn it!

195
00:29:49,327 --> 00:29:52,956
Go on! l get out myself!

196
00:30:43,807 --> 00:30:46,560
What are you doing?

197
00:30:47,687 --> 00:30:50,247
Wild bees! Run!

198
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:53,275
- What's going on?
- Wild bees! Move!

199
00:30:53,367 --> 00:30:56,484
Bees! Run!

200
00:31:00,767 --> 00:31:02,758
Let me be!

201
00:31:03,847 --> 00:31:07,157
You beast! Here!

202
00:31:50,767 --> 00:31:53,281
Look, a shell!

203
00:31:54,007 --> 00:31:56,157
ln the past, the river ran through here.

204
00:31:59,367 --> 00:32:01,005
So what?

205
00:32:03,207 --> 00:32:06,597
l want to know where Lordogold is.

206
00:32:07,167 --> 00:32:14,437
By the spring, perhaps.
Don't worry, we'll get there.

207
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:31,162
- A fortress...
- lt's golden...

208
00:32:41,487 --> 00:32:43,603
This way!

209
00:32:46,847 --> 00:32:48,360
Hurry up!

210
00:32:49,247 --> 00:32:54,446
Why have you not taken me instead?
Why are you so cruel?

211
00:32:54,887 --> 00:32:58,596
Why do you need children?

212
00:32:59,447 --> 00:33:04,965
l, Diva, curse you, Lordogold!

213
00:33:11,607 --> 00:33:14,679
What do you know of Lordogold?
Where is he?

214
00:33:16,407 --> 00:33:18,079
Speak! You know!

215
00:33:18,167 --> 00:33:22,877
Wait! We must get to him!
He did evil things to us too!

216
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:25,162
Leave me alone!
l don't know anything!

217
00:33:25,247 --> 00:33:27,681
You cursed him, and cried...

218
00:33:27,767 --> 00:33:31,476
Because of my sister.
She is still a child!

219
00:33:32,047 --> 00:33:33,765
He took her this morning.

220
00:33:33,847 --> 00:33:36,441
Lordogold? Has he been here?

221
00:33:36,527 --> 00:33:37,437
His horses.

222
00:33:37,527 --> 00:33:39,597
Do you send him people,
not gold?

223
00:33:39,687 --> 00:33:44,807
Gold is more precious.
People grow old and die!

224
00:33:46,447 --> 00:33:48,563
Gold is eternal.

225
00:33:49,287 --> 00:33:52,757
lts beauty lasts forever, like the beauty of
the golden maiden, Mahuliena!

226
00:33:54,327 --> 00:33:55,396
Have you seen her?

227
00:33:56,047 --> 00:34:00,279
No one ever has.
This is what the legend says.

228
00:34:03,327 --> 00:34:07,479
That's terrible! You appreciate
gold more than a child!?

229
00:34:09,207 --> 00:34:15,282
No. lt was by lot!
lt was a twist of fate.

230
00:34:18,247 --> 00:34:22,877
Every year the ones to go

231
00:34:26,527 --> 00:34:29,325
are picked by lot.

232
00:34:30,047 --> 00:34:34,563
lt is our fate.
lt's been like that for ages.

233
00:34:49,407 --> 00:34:52,717
Lordogold, just you wait.

234
00:35:02,167 --> 00:35:03,395
Put the gold away.

235
00:35:03,487 --> 00:35:05,159
No!

236
00:35:06,447 --> 00:35:08,802
l must not! They'll punish me!

237
00:35:08,887 --> 00:35:11,924
Come on, stop crying.

238
00:35:19,767 --> 00:35:22,122
Smile.

239
00:35:22,767 --> 00:35:25,679
l have no reason.

240
00:35:25,767 --> 00:35:28,235
lt has been a long time... l cannot.

241
00:35:28,327 --> 00:35:32,445
Try! Please.

242
00:35:33,287 --> 00:35:37,917
Only for me. Come on!

243
00:35:40,247 --> 00:35:42,442
There you are!

244
00:35:43,167 --> 00:35:45,317
When Lordogold loses Mahuliena,

245
00:35:45,407 --> 00:35:47,602
your sister and the others can come back.

246
00:35:48,447 --> 00:35:50,517
You will smile again.

247
00:35:51,047 --> 00:35:55,962
lt suits you more than gold.

248
00:36:16,327 --> 00:36:19,683
l told you to rest at their place
a couple of days.

249
00:36:21,487 --> 00:36:22,602
At theirs or hers?

250
00:36:22,727 --> 00:36:27,847
So what? l like Diva.

251
00:36:29,927 --> 00:36:33,124
l may never see her again.

252
00:36:40,847 --> 00:36:43,407
And l may never see Mahuliena.

253
00:36:45,487 --> 00:36:47,045
Enough!

254
00:36:47,127 --> 00:36:52,440
Enough of gloomy thoughts.
Make a fire.

255
00:36:54,527 --> 00:36:57,599
lt may brighten our mood.

256
00:37:07,687 --> 00:37:10,360
Can you feel that smell?

257
00:37:11,367 --> 00:37:15,326
No, l can't.

258
00:37:39,247 --> 00:37:43,684
What is wrong with you?
What happened?

259
00:37:49,447 --> 00:37:51,722
Fetch some wood!

260
00:38:15,927 --> 00:38:19,363
Where is that man?

261
00:38:22,327 --> 00:38:24,397
Ján, where are you?

262
00:38:24,887 --> 00:38:27,037
The fire is burning!

263
00:39:00,287 --> 00:39:05,998
Look at all the gold!
Lordogold must be close.

264
00:39:41,447 --> 00:39:43,244
l am so fed up with this!

265
00:39:43,607 --> 00:39:46,440
Me too.

266
00:40:18,127 --> 00:40:20,561
l can't go on!

267
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:24,806
l want water!

268
00:40:25,247 --> 00:40:26,919
Where would l get it?

269
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:28,440
Give me something to drink!

270
00:40:28,527 --> 00:40:32,042
Hold on! Come on!

271
00:40:33,247 --> 00:40:35,442
We're almost at the top

272
00:40:35,887 --> 00:40:39,766
and who knows, Mahuliena may be
on the other side.

273
00:40:41,967 --> 00:40:43,958
Come!

274
00:40:47,447 --> 00:40:49,358
Come on!

275
00:40:53,527 --> 00:40:55,995
At least there is a shadow here.

276
00:40:56,087 --> 00:40:59,557
- l want to sleep.
- Wait here.

277
00:41:00,967 --> 00:41:05,199
l'll be right back. l'll go to the top.

278
00:41:05,727 --> 00:41:08,878
l want to sleep...

279
00:41:52,207 --> 00:41:54,437
The king...

280
00:42:00,927 --> 00:42:02,838
Water...

281
00:42:04,767 --> 00:42:07,235
Are you mad?

282
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:12,357
You must not drink it!

283
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:16,757
lt could be poison! Enough!

284
00:42:20,407 --> 00:42:22,557
How dare you?

285
00:42:22,647 --> 00:42:25,286
Don't you know who l am?

286
00:42:25,487 --> 00:42:30,322
lf you touch me again,
l'll beat you like a dog!

287
00:42:38,927 --> 00:42:42,636
Stop! Where are you going?

288
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:50,603
l am free like a bird!

289
00:42:50,887 --> 00:42:53,037
l want to fly!

290
00:42:53,247 --> 00:42:54,999
- l am going to fly!
- You are mad!

291
00:42:55,087 --> 00:42:59,365
Pull yourself together! Stop!

292
00:43:00,847 --> 00:43:03,441
Let's fly together!

293
00:43:04,007 --> 00:43:07,477
That's enough!

294
00:43:26,967 --> 00:43:29,845
What happened?

295
00:43:32,647 --> 00:43:35,002
l feel dizzy.

296
00:43:37,167 --> 00:43:39,158
What was l doing?

297
00:43:39,887 --> 00:43:43,004
l can't remember anything.

298
00:43:59,367 --> 00:44:02,598
Are you sleeping?

299
00:44:19,727 --> 00:44:22,366
You've warned me three times...

300
00:44:22,927 --> 00:44:26,886
... every time we were in danger.

301
00:44:29,047 --> 00:44:32,926
So this is your secret!

302
00:44:47,047 --> 00:44:49,845
Ján, wake up! Quick!

303
00:44:55,367 --> 00:44:57,164
What is it?

304
00:44:58,047 --> 00:45:00,003
Look!

305
00:45:01,327 --> 00:45:03,966
You've never seen anything like it ever.

306
00:45:09,047 --> 00:45:11,163
Look!

307
00:45:17,007 --> 00:45:19,441
Let's follow them!

308
00:45:41,327 --> 00:45:42,919
There they are -

309
00:46:19,087 --> 00:46:23,399
- bringing water up the hill.
What's the point of that?

310
00:46:39,887 --> 00:46:42,355
We're about to reach our destination!

311
00:46:43,007 --> 00:46:45,043
At last!

312
00:47:11,767 --> 00:47:14,327
The spring of the golden river!

313
00:47:14,727 --> 00:47:17,764
Let's move on!

314
00:47:19,887 --> 00:47:23,766
Wait! l'll go alone from here on.

315
00:47:24,167 --> 00:47:27,000
Should anything happen to me,
you at least can return home.

316
00:47:27,647 --> 00:47:31,640
What? l can't leave you
to your own devices!

317
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:12,282
Help her! Have you no heart?

318
00:49:13,687 --> 00:49:15,962
Come...

319
00:49:22,487 --> 00:49:24,876
She's blind.

320
00:49:37,767 --> 00:49:40,839
Who has done this to you?

321
00:49:41,287 --> 00:49:44,199
Can you hear me?

322
00:49:46,127 --> 00:49:50,120
lt's useless.
They're like the living dead.

323
00:49:51,087 --> 00:49:54,159
l don't think they can see or hear us.

324
00:50:07,807 --> 00:50:10,526
This is where they pour the water!

325
00:50:14,567 --> 00:50:18,003
Lordogold!

326
00:50:20,327 --> 00:50:23,285
Where are you?

327
00:50:24,807 --> 00:50:27,560
Show yourself!

328
00:50:28,087 --> 00:50:31,204
Let's follow the glow.

329
00:51:01,927 --> 00:51:06,637
- Can you see anything?
- No. Nothing.

330
00:51:19,847 --> 00:51:25,285
Finally - you're here!
lt took you quite a while!

331
00:51:25,807 --> 00:51:29,766
l was afraid you would never find
the way to get here!

332
00:51:29,847 --> 00:51:31,997
You villain!

333
00:51:32,727 --> 00:51:36,845
Where are you? Come out!

334
00:51:57,927 --> 00:52:00,202
Your efforts are in vain!

335
00:52:00,287 --> 00:52:04,360
You can't win the maiden by sword!

336
00:52:07,687 --> 00:52:10,645
You've come for her, haven't you?

337
00:52:11,287 --> 00:52:15,280
She can only belong to the one
who can bear to look at her beauty!

338
00:52:15,367 --> 00:52:17,483
Stop skipping and take me to her!

339
00:52:17,567 --> 00:52:20,240
Come, she's waiting!
Look at her!

340
00:52:20,327 --> 00:52:23,797
Look if you are strong enough!
Come!

341
00:53:05,527 --> 00:53:08,803
Mahuliena...

342
00:53:12,367 --> 00:53:14,756
What is it?

343
00:53:29,927 --> 00:53:33,158
What does it mean?

344
00:53:38,247 --> 00:53:40,317
He must not look at her.

345
00:53:40,407 --> 00:53:45,003
You must not look at her!
You must not see her!

346
00:53:45,607 --> 00:53:47,484
Don't listen to him!

347
00:53:47,567 --> 00:53:51,685
lf you don't look at her
she can't be yours!

348
00:53:51,767 --> 00:53:56,204
Nothing in the world is
as beautiful as she is!

349
00:53:57,367 --> 00:54:00,598
Where are you?

350
00:54:01,287 --> 00:54:03,278
Can you hear me?

351
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:07,286
You must not look at her!

352
00:54:09,247 --> 00:54:12,205
Do not look, please!

353
00:54:12,287 --> 00:54:16,405
Do not look, please!

354
00:54:16,487 --> 00:54:20,400
What? You've come all this way to take her,
have you not?

355
00:54:20,687 --> 00:54:24,919
That's why l'll touch her.
Nobody can prevent me from doing that.

356
00:54:25,007 --> 00:54:27,362
What are you doing?
Nobody may touch her!

357
00:54:27,447 --> 00:54:29,119
l forbid you!

358
00:54:29,807 --> 00:54:31,638
Stop me!

359
00:54:31,727 --> 00:54:35,436
You can't, can you?

360
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:38,357
Stop, please.

361
00:54:38,767 --> 00:54:44,763
Take as much gold as you want!
You'll be the richest man of all!

362
00:54:48,407 --> 00:54:52,958
Keep your bloody gold!
Mahuliena is worth more!

363
00:54:53,327 --> 00:54:57,286
Please, don't! Don't do that!

364
00:54:58,727 --> 00:55:01,002
Where is she?

365
00:55:04,647 --> 00:55:08,686
No. No!

366
00:55:22,167 --> 00:55:24,158
Here she is.

367
00:55:28,327 --> 00:55:31,319
How delicate she is!

368
00:56:08,007 --> 00:56:11,602
You've lost, you villain. You lost.

369
00:56:12,327 --> 00:56:15,364
Mahuliena is mine now.

370
00:56:16,287 --> 00:56:18,278
l'll be looking at her

371
00:56:21,487 --> 00:56:23,364
all my life.

372
00:56:23,447 --> 00:56:27,235
Too soon to rejoice!
You won't get her home alive!

373
00:56:27,327 --> 00:56:31,764
She'll die and people will become
my slaves again!

374
00:58:41,167 --> 00:58:44,125
Don't go so close!
You'll get dizzy.

375
00:58:44,207 --> 00:58:46,323
Not anymore.

376
00:58:46,407 --> 00:58:49,001
Why? lt's very deep.

377
00:58:51,847 --> 00:58:57,205
You've made me feel dizzy.

378
00:59:07,367 --> 00:59:09,164
What's wrong?

379
00:59:16,527 --> 00:59:19,360
Let her be! What are you doing?

380
00:59:20,647 --> 00:59:22,444
What is that?

381
00:59:37,167 --> 00:59:38,759
Has he hurt you?

382
00:59:38,847 --> 00:59:41,122
lt is not his fault.

383
00:59:41,207 --> 00:59:43,960
l don't know what it was.
As if something pulled me down.

384
00:59:44,047 --> 00:59:46,959
What could have pulled you?
You slipped.

385
00:59:47,047 --> 00:59:51,404
The shoes. They're no good in the hills.

386
00:59:54,687 --> 00:59:56,803
Why did you throw them away?

387
00:59:56,887 --> 00:59:59,799
l didn't mean to. l dropped them.

388
01:00:00,527 --> 01:00:05,362
How can she walk without shoes?
Barefoot?

389
01:00:08,847 --> 01:00:13,045
l'll walk barefoot.
l'll be glad to, actually.

390
01:01:48,847 --> 01:01:51,281
ls anybody there?

391
01:02:03,087 --> 01:02:06,159
Come! Quick!
We must leave this place.

392
01:02:07,007 --> 01:02:09,840
l think somebody's tracking us.

393
01:02:11,127 --> 01:02:13,402
You see monsters in every shadow.

394
01:02:13,487 --> 01:02:17,685
We're not home yet!
We must be careful!

395
01:02:19,167 --> 01:02:21,317
We'll stay here!

396
01:02:21,407 --> 01:02:22,886
You can go if you're scared!

397
01:02:22,967 --> 01:02:25,435
Go wherever you want,
nobody holds you here!

398
01:02:25,527 --> 01:02:26,437
Stop quarrelling!

399
01:02:26,527 --> 01:02:27,482
He started it.

400
01:02:27,567 --> 01:02:28,886
What's got into you?

401
01:02:28,967 --> 01:02:30,446
He's ordering me around all the time.

402
01:02:30,527 --> 01:02:34,122
We have to do this... we mustn't do that.
l've had enough!

403
01:02:36,167 --> 01:02:40,160
We won't leave before you
get warm and dry.

404
01:02:42,007 --> 01:02:44,396
You're soaked.

405
01:03:18,247 --> 01:03:20,044
Damn it!

406
01:03:21,527 --> 01:03:23,916
Everything is damp.

407
01:03:24,327 --> 01:03:25,680
l'll do that!

408
01:03:25,967 --> 01:03:29,596
Run around a bit, it'll warm you up.

409
01:03:32,807 --> 01:03:34,126
So thoughtful all of a sudden!

410
01:03:34,207 --> 01:03:36,163
l think it's good advice.

411
01:03:36,247 --> 01:03:39,523
Come on!

412
01:04:38,087 --> 01:04:39,805
Are you mad?

413
01:04:40,567 --> 01:04:42,444
What are you doing?

414
01:04:42,887 --> 01:04:46,482
Don't touch it! Leave!
Let go!

415
01:04:46,927 --> 01:04:48,963
Go away! Now!

416
01:04:53,767 --> 01:04:56,406
Let her go, you brute!

417
01:04:58,687 --> 01:05:00,962
Are you possessed?

418
01:05:01,247 --> 01:05:02,999
- Are you hurt?
- No, l'm fine.

419
01:05:03,087 --> 01:05:04,964
Away! Away!

420
01:05:17,967 --> 01:05:21,562
He's watching us. He's a threat.

421
01:05:21,647 --> 01:05:25,356
Who? What are you making up this time?

422
01:05:25,967 --> 01:05:28,003
lt seemed like...

423
01:05:28,767 --> 01:05:30,917
l got frightened.

424
01:05:31,207 --> 01:05:32,356
l am sorry, really.

425
01:05:32,447 --> 01:05:37,999
Liar! You've burned them on purpose!

426
01:05:38,087 --> 01:05:40,078
Don't say such things!

427
01:05:40,167 --> 01:05:42,886
l don't believe him!
He envies me!

428
01:05:42,967 --> 01:05:44,844
He's envious of you and my kingdom!

429
01:05:44,927 --> 01:05:45,564
What?

430
01:05:45,647 --> 01:05:48,081
What's going on with you?
You must not hurt each other!

431
01:05:48,167 --> 01:05:51,204
He's such a hypocrite. l'm not blind.

432
01:05:51,287 --> 01:05:53,517
- Why would l do that?
- l'll tell you.

433
01:05:54,167 --> 01:05:56,476
Oh, here it is.

434
01:06:03,087 --> 01:06:05,476
You'd like to be the king,
wouldn't you?

435
01:06:05,567 --> 01:06:08,001
You long for power and it's
driving you mad!

436
01:06:08,727 --> 01:06:11,525
That's not true!
How can you think that?

437
01:06:11,607 --> 01:06:14,246
So why are you putting it on?

438
01:06:19,887 --> 01:06:23,562
- l cannot tell you.
- You can't!?

439
01:06:23,647 --> 01:06:27,322
l swear! You must believe me.

440
01:06:29,727 --> 01:06:31,877
Did you hear that? Another must!

441
01:06:32,567 --> 01:06:35,877
Yes, we must! He's our friend.

442
01:06:36,007 --> 01:06:41,320
Friend? He's ready to kill us
for a piece of rusty metal!

443
01:06:45,367 --> 01:06:46,482
That's terrible...

444
01:06:46,807 --> 01:06:51,562
lf you harm a hair on her head,
l'll kill you!

445
01:06:57,767 --> 01:07:00,679
Mahuliena, my love!

446
01:07:14,207 --> 01:07:16,437
Hold on just a little longer.

447
01:07:16,727 --> 01:07:20,356
The river is very near.
lt will lead us home.

448
01:07:20,967 --> 01:07:24,004
The closer we are
the more scared l get.

449
01:07:24,087 --> 01:07:26,885
Do not worry, my lady.

450
01:07:29,767 --> 01:07:35,399
l do, for you two.

451
01:07:45,967 --> 01:07:49,004
Wait... l can't go on.

452
01:07:49,087 --> 01:07:51,203
Leave me!

453
01:08:22,327 --> 01:08:26,240
Keep as far away as possible...
just in case!

454
01:08:27,687 --> 01:08:31,077
Your wish is my command,
my king!

455
01:08:53,207 --> 01:08:55,880
Diva! Stop!

456
01:09:01,647 --> 01:09:03,877
Why are you running away?

457
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:13,638
Diva, stop!

458
01:09:14,087 --> 01:09:15,805
Leave me alone!

459
01:09:16,167 --> 01:09:18,078
Listen to me!

460
01:09:22,967 --> 01:09:24,685
Go away!

461
01:09:48,327 --> 01:09:50,966
Why are you still wearing it?

462
01:09:53,047 --> 01:09:57,165
Your people are back,
your sister too, aren't they?

463
01:09:58,207 --> 01:10:01,438
They are but we must not
put away the gold.

464
01:10:01,527 --> 01:10:05,202
- Why not?
- We belong to Lordogold.

465
01:10:05,287 --> 01:10:07,801
He'll surely come back one day.

466
01:10:11,007 --> 01:10:14,317
You need not worry.
He won't. Believe me.

467
01:10:14,687 --> 01:10:19,078
His power will pass for ever
once Mahuliena is home safe.

468
01:10:19,167 --> 01:10:22,284
We'll all be happy, you'll see.

469
01:10:23,047 --> 01:10:24,878
No.

470
01:10:27,287 --> 01:10:30,404
l won't be, ever!

471
01:10:30,487 --> 01:10:32,523
Why not?

472
01:10:37,767 --> 01:10:41,919
- You'll be far away.
- Me?

473
01:10:50,007 --> 01:10:51,884
Why don't you come with me?

474
01:10:51,967 --> 01:10:56,438
No, l can't like this ... l don't want to.

475
01:10:58,527 --> 01:11:01,121
l'll be waiting for you.

476
01:11:07,407 --> 01:11:12,322
You can be sure l'll be back!

477
01:12:31,727 --> 01:12:34,605
Go back. What are you doing?

478
01:12:34,687 --> 01:12:37,565
We can't go home without him!

479
01:12:37,647 --> 01:12:39,956
Why not?

480
01:12:40,567 --> 01:12:45,277
Better for him if l won't see him.
lt could cost him his head.

481
01:13:35,047 --> 01:13:36,878
Do you see him?

482
01:13:37,647 --> 01:13:40,957
He clings to us like a leach.
He's up to something.

483
01:13:42,167 --> 01:13:45,125
Why have l come to life?
We'll be punished for this.

484
01:13:46,327 --> 01:13:48,158
You must not speak this way.

485
01:13:48,247 --> 01:13:51,956
We'll be home by the daybreak.
All will be well.

486
01:13:52,047 --> 01:13:55,881
Perhaps. But we won't be happy.

487
01:15:20,207 --> 01:15:22,163
Ján!

488
01:15:23,247 --> 01:15:23,884
Diva!

489
01:15:23,967 --> 01:15:28,119
Where are you going? Stop!
You mustn't go there!

490
01:15:28,207 --> 01:15:30,277
Diva, you are here?!

491
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:33,518
Wait for me!

492
01:15:34,567 --> 01:15:39,038
l must save Mahuliena!

493
01:15:39,487 --> 01:15:43,480
Are you really a fool?
Why are you doing all this?

494
01:15:45,727 --> 01:15:49,356
- Later!
- Don't follow them!

495
01:15:49,447 --> 01:15:52,723
- l have to!
- Don't go there!

496
01:15:52,807 --> 01:15:56,959
Let them be. Please!

497
01:15:57,047 --> 01:15:59,720
l have to... Before it's too late.

498
01:15:59,807 --> 01:16:02,879
You must not! You'll die!

499
01:16:03,367 --> 01:16:05,881
l cannot betray them.

500
01:16:07,367 --> 01:16:11,121
Trust me! You at least, my love!

501
01:16:14,247 --> 01:16:19,480
lf something happens to me,
only a great sacrifice can save me.

502
01:16:19,567 --> 01:16:22,400
Do you understand?
A great sacrifice!

503
01:16:22,487 --> 01:16:25,684
You don't love me!

504
01:16:28,487 --> 01:16:32,321
You only think of Mahuliena
and the kingdom!

505
01:16:32,407 --> 01:16:34,125
No!

506
01:16:34,847 --> 01:16:38,965
Diva, wait! Come back!

507
01:17:28,207 --> 01:17:30,437
What are you doing?
Let her go!

508
01:17:30,527 --> 01:17:33,405
Her life is in danger!
Can't you see?

509
01:17:33,487 --> 01:17:35,955
Mahuliena, what has he done to you?
Can you hear me?

510
01:17:36,047 --> 01:17:39,357
She was bitten by a snake!
On her lips!

511
01:17:40,167 --> 01:17:43,955
You are the snake! You viper!
l'll kill you!

512
01:17:47,687 --> 01:17:48,756
Traitor!

513
01:17:48,847 --> 01:17:51,805
- You're Lordogold's ally!
- No, no!

514
01:17:51,887 --> 01:17:55,118
Confess, or l'll drown you!

515
01:17:58,967 --> 01:18:02,277
Confess you want to destroy our love!

516
01:18:04,447 --> 01:18:07,757
Let go! That's not true!

517
01:18:08,407 --> 01:18:09,920
Let me go!

518
01:18:10,007 --> 01:18:12,965
Confess! Speak!

519
01:18:13,047 --> 01:18:16,596
l protected your love.

520
01:18:20,727 --> 01:18:24,003
l don't believe a single word you say!
Prove it!

521
01:18:24,087 --> 01:18:27,079
No... Not that!

522
01:18:27,167 --> 01:18:29,237
So you won't speak!?

523
01:18:32,527 --> 01:18:33,960
Let me be!

524
01:18:34,047 --> 01:18:36,766
Come on! Speak!

525
01:18:38,047 --> 01:18:42,518
l knew beforehand what
Lordogold was up to.

526
01:18:43,007 --> 01:18:45,475
You knew that!? How?

527
01:18:45,567 --> 01:18:46,966
l can't...

528
01:18:51,487 --> 01:18:55,196
Wait...

529
01:18:56,127 --> 01:18:58,766
lf l tell you, l'll die.

530
01:18:58,847 --> 01:19:01,725
lf you don't speak, you'll die!

531
01:19:01,807 --> 01:19:04,196
l'm waiting!

532
01:19:06,527 --> 01:19:09,599
You'll be the one to blame.

533
01:19:16,127 --> 01:19:21,963
Your father entrusted me this crown.
For you!

534
01:19:23,407 --> 01:19:25,921
Till the time you become wise!

535
01:19:29,367 --> 01:19:31,881
lt has magic power.

536
01:19:33,567 --> 01:19:38,721
Without this crown
we couldn't have saved Mahuliena.

537
01:19:40,607 --> 01:19:44,964
lt warned me against Lordogold's traps!

538
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:52,199
But he who reveals its secret
will turn into stone.

539
01:20:15,287 --> 01:20:18,085
Ján, get out!

540
01:20:54,727 --> 01:20:58,117
Look who's coming!

541
01:20:58,527 --> 01:21:00,677
Come on, hurry up!

542
01:21:32,007 --> 01:21:34,157
Where am l?

543
01:21:34,247 --> 01:21:37,603
At home, our lady!

544
01:21:38,647 --> 01:21:43,516
Be merry!
Now you have what you wanted!

545
01:22:11,047 --> 01:22:12,366
Hey, sir!

546
01:22:13,447 --> 01:22:15,802
Can you hear me?

547
01:22:40,807 --> 01:22:45,164
ls that you?
Where can l find Ján?

548
01:22:45,247 --> 01:22:48,000
He's not far.

549
01:22:48,087 --> 01:22:49,839
Turned into stone.

550
01:22:49,927 --> 01:22:53,158
As if he grew roots into the riverbed.

551
01:22:55,047 --> 01:22:56,116
So it is true.

552
01:22:56,207 --> 01:23:00,997
l've tried everything... To no avail!

553
01:23:05,567 --> 01:23:08,206
Really, everything?

554
01:23:09,327 --> 01:23:12,842
There must be a way!

555
01:23:16,927 --> 01:23:19,122
Yes, there is - a great sacrifice.

556
01:23:19,567 --> 01:23:24,163
- What?
- These were his last words.

557
01:23:26,567 --> 01:23:31,436
lf something happens to me,
only a great sacrifice can save me.

558
01:23:34,847 --> 01:23:37,077
What sacrifice - l don't know.

559
01:23:37,167 --> 01:23:39,123
l didn't believe him!

560
01:23:39,687 --> 01:23:43,236
A sacrifice. That's it!

561
01:23:43,327 --> 01:23:46,285
A sacrifice... sacrifice.

562
01:23:50,847 --> 01:23:54,806
Where are you going? Wait!

563
01:24:06,087 --> 01:24:08,601
l must talk to the queen
before it's too late!

564
01:24:08,687 --> 01:24:11,599
Nobody is allowed to see her!
lt's the king's order.

565
01:24:11,887 --> 01:24:14,924
The king is the reason.
He's desperate!

566
01:24:15,007 --> 01:24:17,999
Back!

567
01:24:18,087 --> 01:24:22,080
Everybody knows that!
The queen must not be hurt!

568
01:24:22,167 --> 01:24:23,759
ls it clear?

569
01:24:23,847 --> 01:24:25,326
What happened to the king?

570
01:24:25,407 --> 01:24:27,875
He wants to drown in the river.
l couldn't stop him.

571
01:24:27,967 --> 01:24:29,116
What?

572
01:24:29,207 --> 01:24:30,435
He says he must sacrifice himself.

573
01:24:30,527 --> 01:24:32,757
You're not safe outside, our lady.

574
01:24:32,847 --> 01:24:36,237
Get out of my way!
lt's an order!

575
01:24:36,967 --> 01:24:40,642
We have a different order!

576
01:25:14,447 --> 01:25:17,598
Mahuliena, go back home!

577
01:25:18,127 --> 01:25:21,164
Home!

578
01:25:22,087 --> 01:25:25,841
Please, do it!

579
01:25:26,527 --> 01:25:29,405
Do you want me to lose you too?

580
01:25:36,247 --> 01:25:39,842
Now l know Ján can only
be saved by a great sacrifice

581
01:25:41,167 --> 01:25:44,239
He himself said it.
And what is more than life?

582
01:25:45,287 --> 01:25:48,006
Yet, mine is not enough.
The river doesn't want me.

583
01:25:49,647 --> 01:25:52,400
lt's returning me.

584
01:25:57,007 --> 01:25:59,362
What are you doing? Let me be!

585
01:25:59,447 --> 01:26:01,915
l must sacrifice myself.

586
01:26:02,007 --> 01:26:05,556
You cannot do anything alone.

587
01:26:07,167 --> 01:26:09,920
Our love is to blame
for everything.

588
01:26:10,007 --> 01:26:14,046
He can only be saved by both of us.

589
01:26:43,807 --> 01:26:46,844
l didn't want this to happen!

590
01:26:47,567 --> 01:26:51,560
Not this... no...

591
01:27:34,767 --> 01:27:37,839
They're alive!

592
01:27:54,247 --> 01:27:57,159
They're coming!

593
01:28:25,407 --> 01:28:27,443
Oh, l must go back.

594
01:28:27,887 --> 01:28:30,242
The crown is in the river.

595
01:28:30,327 --> 01:28:33,364
lt doesn't matter.
We don't need it anymore.

596
01:28:33,447 --> 01:28:35,517
Let it stay there forever.

597
01:28:35,607 --> 01:28:37,802
Forever?

598
01:28:44,367 --> 01:28:46,437
Forever.
