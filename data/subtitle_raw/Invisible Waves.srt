1
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:14,680
INVISIBLE WAVES

2
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,930
That's for Noi?

3
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:38,240
Oh, yes.

4
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:39,960
You know her too.

5
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,360
You're going to ask her to marry you?

6
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:47,280
Tonight.

7
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,770
Compliments of the boss.

8
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:48,450
I still think this place is creepy.

9
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:53,090
I hate seeing those machines.

10
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,160
Something smells great!

11
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,650
Dinner's almost ready.

12
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,480
I meant you.

13
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,210
Let's skip dinner...

14
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,670
... and have dessert now.

15
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:20,600
Oh, but I think you'll enjoy dinner more.

16
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,970
You've been working too long
for my husband.

17
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:28,080
You're starting to talk like him.

18
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:36,640
I have to stir the sauce.

19
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,210
I love it when you talk like that!

20
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,760
Seiko, the sauce will be ruined
if I don't stir it.

21
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,960
That's okay.
I like my sauce medium-ruined.

22
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,720
Well, that was delicious, darling...

23
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:24,090
... as always.

24
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:25,920
Did you have enough?

25
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:29,440
I might have room for something more.

26
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,090
I made chocolate mousse.

27
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:35,160
Oh well, there's room for that too.

28
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,610
I'll get some more wine.

29
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:50,080
Okay, darling. You're the boss.

30
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,290
Oh, wait a minute.
Actually, you're not the boss.

31
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,530
Oops, sorry darling.

32
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,360
Come on, get the mousse and hurry back.

33
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,210
Oh, I like this.

34
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:15,040
Let's turn it up a bit, okay?

35
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:18,490
The neighbors won't mind, will they?

36
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:23,520
I have only one neighbor.
She won't mind.

37
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:32,040
You don't look like
your father at all, you know?

38
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:42,920
You still don't have a TV?

39
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,890
What do you do when you're alone?

40
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,080
I sleep.

41
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,090
But how do you know
what's going on in the world?

42
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,560
I already know.

43
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,010
There's always war.

44
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,130
You are so cynical, darling.

45
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,490
Kiss me.

46
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,890
Are you drunk?

47
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,170
Why? You gonna take advantage
of me if I'm drunk?

48
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,710
You still have to eat your mousse.

49
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:55,080
Good morning.

50
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:30,400
W RESTAURANT

51
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,320
The restaurant's closed.

52
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,770
Go home.

53
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:49,080
Good morning, boss.

54
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,640
You want some cigarette?

55
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:56,890
No, thanks. I don't feel so good.

56
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:00,250
Go home and pack.

57
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,480
Kyoji!

58
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,490
You have a good vacation.

59
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:38,520
Hello.

60
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,090
Hello.

61
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,450
I am Kyoji.

62
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:43,010
Do you know me?

63
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:46,930
No, I don't know you.

64
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,610
But I know why you're here.

65
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,440
You are a little bit early.

66
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:56,440
Come worship first.

67
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,570
I'll be with you later.

68
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:16,080
Did you pray?

69
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:18,010
No.

70
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:19,320
Why not?

71
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:22,400
I didn't come here for that.

72
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:24,090
I see.

73
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:25,600
You came here for this, I believe.

74
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,280
I think so.

75
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:31,090
Everything you want is inside there.

76
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:34,050
The ticket, the money, the documents.

77
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,920
I'll send you more money...

78
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:39,440
... when you're in Phuket.

79
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,320
This is very important

80
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,930
Your life now depends on it.

81
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:52,200
Lizard's contact number is inside.

82
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:53,680
Lizard?

83
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,490
Yes, from now on...

84
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:58,440
... he's the one you'll have to contact.

85
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,010
Any problem...

86
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:02,920
... contact Lizard.

87
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:05,840
Remember, Lizard.

88
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,130
Only Lizard.

89
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:09,720
He's your man.

90
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:12,290
Your only contact with the past.

91
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,560
Can you give this to the boss?

92
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:27,210
Okay, I'll take care of it.

93
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,000
Have a good life.

94
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,610
Are you really a monk?

95
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,410
My father was.

96
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,490
Hi, Maria.

97
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,330
Oh, you're back.

98
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,530
What did you do
to your apartment last night?

99
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:49,520
It smells horrible!

100
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:51,770
Leave the door open.

101
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,040
Can I wash up at your place?

102
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,610
Sure, go ahead.

103
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:57,600
I'll make dinner tonight.

104
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:12,640
So, you're leaving tomorrow, huh?

105
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,760
That's a big surprise.

106
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,090
Are you all ready.

107
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:20,480
I guess.

108
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,410
My boy's always ready.

109
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,250
What do you think about leaving?

110
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:30,210
I'm going to miss you.

111
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,280
I know.

112
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,280
I'll write to you.

113
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,920
From the ship?

114
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,200
I'll write to you.

115
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:45,210
Okay. I'll wait for that.

116
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,920
Hello? Are you Lizard?

117
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:53,680
I'm leaving now.

118
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,070
Bon Voyage.

119
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:00,240
When I get to Phuket I'll call you.

120
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,160
Have a good life.

121
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,450
Can I help you, sir?

122
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:54,840
I think you got the wrong room, sir.

123
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,410
I can show you your room.

124
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,120
Follow me, please.

125
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,210
Wha...? What the...?

126
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:53,440
What in the...?

127
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,760
May we have your attention please.

128
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:05,090
Universal Cruise will depart
Hong Kong shortly.

129
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:20,720
May we have your attention please.

130
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:24,880
Universal Cruise will depart
Hong Kong shortly.

131
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:12,000
Lunch will be served shortly
at all of our restaurants...

132
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:18,010
... Galaxy Cuisine, Tropical Cuisine,
Planet CafÃ©, and Moonlight Diner.

133
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:22,480
Please enjoy your dinner
at the closest restaurant to your cabin...

134
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:26,170
... or at any of the restaurants as you wish.

135
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,610
May we have your attention, please?

136
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:47,850
In a few minutes
there will be an emergency drill.

137
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:52,880
This is the mandatory procedure
for all cruises with passengers.

138
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:55,130
It is for your own safety.

139
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:59,290
When the drill is heard,
please gather in the lobby.

140
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:03,650
We will then divide you into small groups
for a twenty minute-lecture...

141
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:14,400
Not afraid of dying?

142
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:19,070
What?

143
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:22,000
You don't go to safety lecture.

144
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:23,960
So...

145
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:27,560
I thought maybe you are not afraid to die.

146
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,200
How about you?

147
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,430
What?

148
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:32,720
You're not afraid?

149
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:35,480
Oh, I am afraid to die, yeah.

150
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,690
Why are you here?

151
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:43,600
I... I need some air.

152
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:46,550
Me too.

153
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:54,530
Yes, I can tell you need air.

154
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,570
You look like... ah...

155
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:04,080
... you are seeing a ghost.

156
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,970
A ghost?

157
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,530
Hey! What are you doing here?

158
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:07,450
Who left you alone like this?

159
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:11,000
Where's your mommy, huh?

160
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:14,520
Nid, mummy's back.

161
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,120
You.

162
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,560
Good morning.

163
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:20,830
Your baby?

164
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,920
You left your baby alone?

165
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:25,450
No. I left her with you.

166
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:27,880
With me?

167
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:29,290
But I am a stranger.

168
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:30,520
I was sleeping.

169
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:31,870
So?

170
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:34,400
So... is that safe?

171
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,570
I only went to the pool for a few minutes.

172
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:42,080
What time is it?

173
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:45,320
I don't know... Between nine and noon.

174
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,120
Where's your husband?

175
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:03,440
He should take care of the baby.

176
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:04,710
No husband.

177
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,400
No husband?

178
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,000
Not really.

179
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:10,410
Not really? Why?

180
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,330
Why what?

181
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:15,400
Sorry, not my business.

182
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:20,200
He's just not here on this ship.

183
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:24,080
You are here just with your baby?

184
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:27,240
My boyfriend is a very busy man.

185
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:29,710
This trip is a gift to me.

186
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:32,890
You enjoy traveling alone with your baby?

187
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:34,890
It's okay.

188
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,010
You alone too?

189
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,370
Yes.

190
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,450
You want to take a swim?

191
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:52,160
No. Not really.

192
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:54,320
Good.

193
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,330
What?

194
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:01,210
I want to swim.

195
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,480
Not long.

196
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:04,960
Please.

197
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:07,720
Thank you.

198
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,850
What is her name?

199
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,720
Nid.

200
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:24,690
- What's your name?
- Noi.

201
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:25,950
Noi?

202
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:28,510
What's your name?

203
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,360
My name is Kyoji.

204
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,370
Okay... Uncle Kyoji.

205
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,440
Let's go swimming.

206
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:05,160
Open it!

207
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:06,880
Why'd you lock me in here?

208
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,850
Hey, is somebody out there?

209
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:26,160
Hey!

210
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:31,000
What are you doing?

211
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:55,720
Good afternoon, reception.
Can I help you?

212
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:56,960
Err... Yes.

213
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:00,330
I am calling from 96M.

214
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:02,120
I am in the room.

215
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:04,880
I cannot get out.

216
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:06,570
You cannot get out from inside?

217
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:08,280
Yes, inside the room.

218
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,120
You cannot get out from inside the room?

219
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:11,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

220
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:13,080
Do you have your room key, sir?

221
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:14,350
Yes I have key...

222
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:17,680
... but I cannot use my key
because I'm in the room.

223
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,960
- In the room?
- Yes.

224
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,090
I want to get out.

225
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:24,760
Do you want to get inside the room?
Or you cannot get out from inside the room?

226
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:27,320
No, no, no... I said I'm in the room.

227
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:29,400
- lnside the room?
- Yes.

228
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:35,600
Just get someone down here
and open the door, please.

229
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:37,410
- You want to get inside?
- No.

230
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:39,720
- I'm inside the room.
- That's very strange, sir.

231
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:42,080
Normally people cannot get
inside the room. We've never...

232
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:51,270
Good afternoon, sir.

233
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:53,760
Hello? Is this room 96M?

234
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,070
Hello.

235
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:57,320
I am still in my room!

236
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,760
Have you sent anybody here?

237
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:01,290
Can you identify yourself?
We'd like to know who you are.

238
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,930
- Me?
- Are you the guest of the room, sir.

239
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:04,760
I am Kyoji Hamamura...

240
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,150
... in room 96M!

241
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:08,480
96M?

242
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:10,770
I've just called to tell you.

243
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:11,890
Do you have your key?

244
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:13,690
Yes!...I have my key!

245
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:16,360
You can't get in your room?
Or you can't get out of your room?

246
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:18,290
I already told you everything!

247
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:19,690
You mean you locked yourself inside?

248
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:22,610
Come and let me out, please.

249
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:26,050
Well, let me see what we can do, sir.

250
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:44,490
Hey! Excuse me!

251
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:48,720
I am in room 96M.

252
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:51,040
Uh... Could you help me?

253
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:53,850
Uh... I cannot get out.

254
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:55,970
Hey!

255
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:01,570
Hey!

256
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:08,080
Someone in there?

257
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:09,600
Yes! Yes! Yes!

258
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:12,280
Ah, I can not get out.

259
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:14,440
Please help me.

260
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,570
Somebody called.

261
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:18,320
Please. Please.

262
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:20,880
You can't get out from inside?

263
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,680
Yes. Yes.

264
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:27,170
Just a minute. I'll go get someone.

265
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:28,930
Yes, please.

266
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:39,560
I called the receptionist many times!

267
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:40,760
You never came.

268
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:43,360
Sorry, sir. We are busy at the moment.

269
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:44,920
Busy?

270
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,720
Thank you for your help.

271
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:49,840
Oh, it's okay.

272
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:00,630
Be careful of the door.

273
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,320
Thank you.

274
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:08,000
What was wrong with my door?

275
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:10,640
Well... seemed like the lock snapped, sir.

276
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:13,640
- Snapped?
- Yes, some kind of accident.

277
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,080
Maybe old lock.

278
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:16,760
Accident?

279
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:18,600
I don't think so.

280
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:20,440
I think someone locked me inside.

281
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:22,130
- Someone?
- Yes.

282
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:23,840
Who, sir?

283
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:25,970
I don't know.

284
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:27,560
I think old lock, sir.

285
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,530
But should be okay now.

286
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:31,360
Will there be anything else, sir?

287
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:33,250
You can go.

288
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:37,040
Excuse me.

289
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,410
Kyoji Hamamura!

290
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:41,560
I can't believe it! It's really you!

291
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:43,760
Do I know you?

292
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:45,570
Know me?

293
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:47,560
Don't you remember me?

294
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:48,970
Oh! I'm hurt!

295
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:51,160
Sorry.

296
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:54,520
We went to school together!

297
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,530
Really? The same school?

298
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,530
You have such a bad memory!

299
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:03,250
Come on...

300
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:05,000
- Not exactly.
- Where you headed?

301
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:06,680
I have to go and meet someone.

302
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:08,440
But you're meeting me!

303
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:11,690
It's a lot more exciting!

304
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:13,680
You don't look too happy to see me.

305
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:16,000
Well, I'm a bit busy.

306
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:19,650
You really don't remember?

307
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:20,760
Sorry...

308
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:23,880
Hideki!

309
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:25,640
You haven't seen me for fifteen years...

310
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:28,130
... and you tell me you're too busy to chat?

311
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:33,640
So how are you?

312
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:37,320
I can't believe that of all places
we meet again on this ship.

313
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:39,730
Even the sea can seem so small.

314
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:40,920
Hideki?

315
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:42,920
Yes! Now you remember?

316
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:46,410
And how is your brother?

317
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,090
Married? Kids?

318
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:51,370
To be honest I still don't think
we know each other.

319
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:52,880
But you are Kyoji Hamamura, right?

320
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:54,010
Yes, but...

321
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:55,010
From Osaka, yes?

322
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:56,190
Yes. But now I live in Macau.

323
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:58,200
Macau? Wow! Great.

324
00:42:58,410 --> 00:42:59,120
We went to school together?

325
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:00,720
Yes. Now you remember?

326
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:03,080
Those were the days.

327
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:05,050
Sneaking off to read manga
on the way to school.

328
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:06,310
- In Osaka?
- Yep.

329
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,400
I never went to school in Osaka.

330
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:11,320
I don't think I am who you think I am.

331
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,560
You're Kyoji Hamamura!

332
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:20,080
Maybe you know another
Kyoji Hamamura that looks like me.

333
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:22,160
How could that be?

334
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:25,490
But I remember you...

335
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:26,680
Really, you got the wrong guy.

336
00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:28,890
No, no. I'm sure it's you.

337
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:32,090
I still don't think we know each other.

338
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:34,570
But you are Kyoji Hamamura, right?

339
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:36,770
Yeah, but...

340
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:39,050
I'm sure it's you.

341
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:41,920
How are your kids?
Are they wearing braces yet?

342
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:44,290
Look, I don't know you.

343
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:49,090
Must be my mistake.

344
00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:50,600
I told you.

345
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:53,410
Sorry about that. So long.

346
00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:55,280
Uh, no, no, no. No wine.

347
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:58,490
Sorry, sir. What are you going to have?

348
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:01,130
Have anything non-alcoholic?

349
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:03,370
- Are you Japanese?
- Yes.

350
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:04,490
Just a moment.

351
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:13,080
Everything we serve is non-alcoholic...
except the alcohol, sir.

352
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:15,450
I guess that's true.

353
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:17,690
Okay, give me milk.

354
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:19,840
- Milk, sir?
- Yes.

355
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:24,690
Such an innocent drink
for someone like you.

356
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:26,440
Someone like me?

357
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:27,890
I don't mean to be rude, sir.

358
00:45:28,090 --> 00:45:31,400
I mean, you seem a very experienced man.

359
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:33,400
I don't understand.

360
00:45:33,610 --> 00:45:34,840
Forgive me, sir.

361
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:36,520
I make no sense.

362
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:39,000
That's why they put me here.

363
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:47,040
You enjoy your cruise so far, sir?

364
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:49,240
To be honest, no.

365
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:52,760
I see. That's why you come
to the bar so early.

366
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:56,210
Why did you decide to take
this cruise, sir? Vacation?

367
00:45:56,370 --> 00:46:00,290
Not really. Somebody arranged it for me.

368
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:02,090
I see. Like you won a prize?

369
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:04,760
No. Well... yeah. Something like that.

370
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:07,930
Sorry for asking too much, sir.

371
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:17,570
You like your job here?

372
00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:19,840
To be honest, no, sir.

373
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:21,480
No?

374
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:25,000
In fact, I hate it, sir.

375
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:32,210
Why do you do it then?

376
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:34,280
Well, this may sound strange to you...

377
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:37,490
... but I'm doing it to atone
for the sins of my life, sir.

378
00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:38,680
What?

379
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:42,850
Yes, well, you see, sir...

380
00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:45,850
... I was a very troubled teenager
and caused my folks many worries.

381
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:47,360
Troubled?

382
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:49,250
Yes, sir.

383
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:52,650
Drugs and stealing, things like that.

384
00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:55,490
A bad ass, you know, sir?

385
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:59,160
But then I wised up.

386
00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:05,440
I decided I'd do something unpleasant
as punishment for my past.

387
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:18,410
I see.

388
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:27,000
My folks had been so nice to me.

389
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:29,400
They never punished me and I got spoiled.

390
00:47:29,610 --> 00:47:33,390
So I took this job to punish myself.

391
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:36,890
Now I never get to see anyone...

392
00:47:37,450 --> 00:47:39,410
... but it's probably for the best

393
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:45,050
I think I understand.

394
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:51,290
May I ask you something, sir?

395
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:52,760
Go ahead.

396
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:56,010
Did you love your father, sir?

397
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:59,250
My father?

398
00:47:59,450 --> 00:48:01,610
Did you think he was a good man, sir?

399
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:04,000
Good man?

400
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:06,330
Maybe.

401
00:48:06,770 --> 00:48:10,760
But... I wouldn't know much
about being a good man.

402
00:48:10,970 --> 00:48:12,760
I am not such a good man myself.

403
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:16,550
Maybe my father was better than me.

404
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:19,290
I think you are a good man, sir.

405
00:48:24,450 --> 00:48:27,120
How long will you keep
punishing yourself on this ship?

406
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:30,010
I am not sure, sir.

407
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:33,440
I do like the sea.

408
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:35,200
The sea?

409
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:37,050
You don't find it boring?

410
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:38,130
No.

411
00:48:38,570 --> 00:48:42,610
I like the feeling that
the sea isn't judging me.

412
00:48:42,810 --> 00:48:46,640
I just look at it, and it just looks at me.

413
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:48,030
Strange...

414
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:49,920
What's that, sir?

415
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:55,480
It judges me all the time.

416
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:20,970
Hello, Uncle Kyoji.

417
00:49:21,650 --> 00:49:23,040
Uncle Kyoji

418
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:24,880
Want to dance?

419
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:27,760
Hi.

420
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:31,760
Are you okay?

421
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:33,920
Yes, I'm fine.

422
00:49:34,610 --> 00:49:36,360
You look awful!

423
00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:38,970
I'm sorry.

424
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:42,690
Want to dance?

425
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:48,370
What about the baby?

426
00:49:49,130 --> 00:49:51,160
We all dance together.

427
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:54,130
Okay.

428
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:13,690
It's getting late.

429
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:17,560
I will take Nid back to the room
and go to sleep.

430
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:21,730
I think I'll stay here for a while.

431
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:29,560
Goodnight, Uncle Kyoji.

432
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:32,610
It was nice dancing with you.

433
00:50:32,810 --> 00:50:35,010
- Good night.
- Good night.

434
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:13,600
Hey!

435
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:17,250
Hey, Noi!

436
00:51:21,690 --> 00:51:22,600
Yes?

437
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:26,090
Can I have your number or address?
If you don't mind.

438
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:29,520
Well, I will be in Hong Kong...

439
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:31,490
You have a phone there?

440
00:51:31,690 --> 00:51:33,360
Yes, a mobile phone.

441
00:51:33,570 --> 00:51:35,080
That's fine.

442
00:51:37,090 --> 00:51:38,570
Do you have a pen?

443
00:51:41,930 --> 00:51:43,070
You can write on this.

444
00:51:43,290 --> 00:51:46,400
Oh, I love it when a man gives me money.

445
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:49,080
Turn around.

446
00:52:01,530 --> 00:52:03,160
Okay, finished.

447
00:52:05,210 --> 00:52:06,480
Thanks.

448
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:08,000
- Bye.
- Bye.

449
00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:11,600
Don't spend my number!

450
00:52:11,810 --> 00:52:13,120
I will not.

451
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:22,170
Hey, Mister.

452
00:52:22,370 --> 00:52:23,510
Where you going?

453
00:52:23,730 --> 00:52:25,000
I don't know, actually.

454
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:28,440
You looking for girls? Or food?

455
00:52:28,890 --> 00:52:30,640
Maybe a hotel. Cheap hotel.

456
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:33,360
No problem. Phuket many cheap hotels.

457
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:34,880
No luggage?

458
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:36,690
No. Just this.

459
00:52:38,490 --> 00:52:41,080
Hey, hey. Wait, wait wait.

460
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:44,560
Flower for you.

461
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:47,930
Welcome to Thailand and Phuket!

462
00:52:48,130 --> 00:52:49,270

Oh, I don't know. For a while.

00:53:54,650 --> 00:53:56,760
Oh, sorry, I don't have Thai money.

476
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:58,490

00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:30,770
Excuse me.

00:56:31,170 --> 00:56:32,400

Hello, my friend.

Where is room 33?

501
00:59:55,690 --> 00:59:56,960
Hello.

502
00:59:58,660 --> 00:59:59,970
Hello.

503
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:03,370
Hello?

504
01:00:17,810 --> 01:00:19,080
Excuse me.

505
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:22,840
Did you see anyone come down here?

506
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:24,290
Who?

507
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:27,130
Someone. I don't know.

508
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:29,250
No, I don't see any.

509
01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:32,680
Can I change room?

510
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:34,600
What's the problem?

511
01:00:37,690 --> 01:00:39,120
Er... Bad bed.

512
01:00:39,650 --> 01:00:40,920
Bed?

513
01:00:41,450 --> 01:00:44,440
No need to change the room.
I come fix for you.

514
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:46,760
Okay.

515
01:03:02,530 --> 01:03:03,720
Hello.

516
01:03:04,540 --> 01:03:05,670
Hello.

517
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:09,530
Why do you call me here?
I told you not to...

518
01:03:09,730 --> 01:03:12,480
Sorry, boss. I'm in trouble.

519
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:13,680
I was robbed.

520
01:03:13,970 --> 01:03:15,200
You were robbed?

521
01:03:15,410 --> 01:03:16,610
Yes, last night.

522
01:03:17,420 --> 01:03:18,330
In Thailand?

523
01:03:18,530 --> 01:03:21,320
Everything's gone. I have no money.
I have nothing.

524
01:03:21,530 --> 01:03:23,920
I lost Lizard's number.
That's why I call you.

525
01:03:24,130 --> 01:03:25,490
Are you still in Phuket?

526
01:03:25,690 --> 01:03:26,920
Yes.

527
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:30,440
Alright.

528
01:03:31,810 --> 01:03:35,160
I know some people down there.
So I'm going to make a few calls, okay?

529
01:03:35,370 --> 01:03:38,480
Call me back in two hours time.

530
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:40,600
But call me at the restaurant.

531
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:44,000
Do not call this me here, get it?

532
01:03:44,290 --> 01:03:45,840
Thanks, boss.

533
01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:48,480
You take care, now.

534
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:51,930
Forty baht, forty baht. Who took it?

535
01:04:52,130 --> 01:04:54,480
Did anyone see it?

536
01:04:54,980 --> 01:04:59,170
It was right here.
Who took the forty baht?

537
01:05:54,940 --> 01:05:58,210
Uh, I'd like to make
a collect call to Hong Kong.

538
01:05:58,380 --> 01:06:04,090
The number is 231 18081. 8-1, yes.

539
01:06:04,650 --> 01:06:06,400
For Mr. Wiwat.

540
01:06:09,010 --> 01:06:11,570
Kyoji Hamamura.

541
01:06:13,930 --> 01:06:16,570
- Hello?
- I found someone to help you out.

542
01:06:17,130 --> 01:06:18,970
He can meet you at 4.

543
01:06:19,580 --> 01:06:21,360
He can lend you some money...

544
01:06:22,340 --> 01:06:24,570
... and may be help you
with some other things.

545
01:06:25,250 --> 01:06:26,880
Do you know the Pearl Hotel?

546
01:06:27,090 --> 01:06:28,150
No.

547
01:06:29,810 --> 01:06:31,120
Well, it's very well-known.

548
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:33,320
Just ask around, okay.

549
01:06:33,530 --> 01:06:35,640
He's going to meet you at the hotel bar.

550
01:06:35,820 --> 01:06:37,570
How will he know me?

551
01:06:37,970 --> 01:06:39,110
Just get there on time.

552
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:40,680
Okay.

553
01:06:40,940 --> 01:06:42,930
Boss, uh...

554
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:45,610
I don't know if I want to live here...

555
01:06:45,810 --> 01:06:47,530
We can talk about this later.

556
01:06:47,730 --> 01:06:51,480
Right now you have
to stay away for awhile.

557
01:06:52,530 --> 01:06:54,040
How's everything over there?

558
01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:56,410
Everything's fine. I can handle it.

559
01:06:56,660 --> 01:07:00,690
You go out and get your money,
eat some crab, fuck a Thai girl.

560
01:07:00,890 --> 01:07:03,450
Just relax, okay?

561
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:05,640
Okay, boss.

562
01:07:07,530 --> 01:07:09,320
Kyoji.

563
01:07:10,180 --> 01:07:11,890
Everything will be all right.

564
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:20,850
Look, how many times do I have to tell you.

565
01:07:21,020 --> 01:07:24,040
Put the beet root on top of the lettuce.

566
01:07:54,580 --> 01:07:56,330
What would you like to drink?

567
01:08:01,940 --> 01:08:03,080
You talking to me?

568
01:08:03,220 --> 01:08:04,090
No...

569
01:08:04,370 --> 01:08:07,680
... I'm talking to the pineappple next to you.

570
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:14,610
You are Kyoji, aren't you?

571
01:08:15,370 --> 01:08:16,320
You are...

572
01:08:16,530 --> 01:08:18,320
Your boss sent me.

573
01:08:18,530 --> 01:08:19,650
So, what's it gonna be?

574
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:21,720
Err... milk.

575
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:23,360
Of course.

576
01:08:23,570 --> 01:08:25,530
A glass of milk, please.

577
01:08:37,460 --> 01:08:38,650
You are Japanese.

578
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:41,650
You expected a Thai man?
Sorry to disappoint you.

579
01:08:42,810 --> 01:08:44,030
You from Japan?

580
01:08:44,290 --> 01:08:46,360
Yeah, but enough about me.

581
01:08:46,540 --> 01:08:48,370
You don't look so good, man.

582
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:50,320
Well, I have had some trouble.

583
01:08:50,730 --> 01:08:52,280
So your boss told me.

584
01:08:52,490 --> 01:08:54,600
Anyway, cheers!

585
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:02,690
What did the boss say?

586
01:09:02,940 --> 01:09:04,530
Not much.

587
01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:08,250
To give you money. Take care of you a bit.

588
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:09,920
He told you who I am?

589
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:13,290
Why, is it a secret?

590
01:09:16,420 --> 01:09:18,570
C'mon, man, don't be so paranoid.

591
01:09:18,820 --> 01:09:21,320
You're not in Hong Kong anymore.

592
01:09:21,530 --> 01:09:23,440
Why worry so much?

593
01:09:23,650 --> 01:09:25,250
Guess I'm just tired.

594
01:09:26,130 --> 01:09:29,330
Bet you are. You look like shit.

595
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:38,410
The boss told me
you might settle down here.

596
01:09:38,580 --> 01:09:40,360
Maybe open a restaurant.

597
01:09:40,570 --> 01:09:44,490
Don't know yet.
That was the original plan.

598
01:09:44,740 --> 01:09:46,240
Well, it's not a bad place.

599
01:09:46,810 --> 01:09:48,770
I gather you're quite a good chef.

600
01:09:49,140 --> 01:09:51,480
Did the boss tell you all this?

601
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:54,290
Who else?

602
01:09:55,050 --> 01:09:59,130
We are not so different, you and l.

603
01:09:59,330 --> 01:10:02,680
I know what it's like to be in your shoes.
I was there once myself.

604
01:10:03,620 --> 01:10:05,610
Your boss is very generous.

605
01:10:05,890 --> 01:10:07,680
That is, if you're loyal.

606
01:10:08,690 --> 01:10:10,290
Did you get the job done?

607
01:10:11,020 --> 01:10:12,680
I guess so.

608
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:17,480
Good. Then I guarantee the boss
will take good care of you.

609
01:10:17,980 --> 01:10:21,410
I've never known such a big-hearted man.

610
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:25,570
That is...

611
01:10:26,730 --> 01:10:29,190
... as long as you're loyal to him.

612
01:10:36,250 --> 01:10:38,480
He also promised me freedom.

613
01:10:38,770 --> 01:10:39,720
Freedom, yes.

614
01:10:47,490 --> 01:10:49,450
Do you like karaoke?

615
01:10:49,970 --> 01:10:52,410
I don't sing well.

616
01:10:52,580 --> 01:10:54,480
Ah, but it's not about singing anyway.

617
01:10:55,010 --> 01:10:56,760
It's a great invention...

618
01:10:56,970 --> 01:10:59,000
... probably the best thing
Japan's ever given to the world.

619
01:10:59,530 --> 01:11:00,670
Think about it.

620
01:11:00,890 --> 01:11:03,640
Karaoke's such a great concept.

621
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:05,250
The music itself is empty...

622
01:11:05,450 --> 01:11:10,690
but when you who hold the microphone
you're the one who fills it with substance.

623
01:11:11,370 --> 01:11:12,290
Want to?

624
01:11:12,490 --> 01:11:13,410
No, thanks.

625
01:11:13,580 --> 01:11:15,050
Sure? C'mon.

626
01:11:15,250 --> 01:11:17,090
Really, it's okay.

627
01:11:17,290 --> 01:11:18,430
Alright then.

628
01:11:18,620 --> 01:11:19,880
I hope you don't mind if I do.

629
01:11:20,090 --> 01:11:23,050
I want to give you a welcome song.

630
01:12:14,410 --> 01:12:16,480
Hope you enjoyed that.

631
01:12:16,660 --> 01:12:18,040
It's my gift to you.

632
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:19,650
Yes, thanks.

633
01:12:20,260 --> 01:12:25,520
Well, I guess you're anxious to get
your stuff and get back to your hotel.

634
01:12:25,700 --> 01:12:27,570
Yes.

635
01:12:29,980 --> 01:12:31,490
Very well.

636
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:34,050
It's not a lot...

637
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:37,560
... but since it was kind of sudden,
it was all I could get today.

638
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:40,330
Come back here tomorrow
and I'll give you more.

639
01:12:41,020 --> 01:12:42,770
Tomorrow, same time?

640
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:44,210
Yes, that okay?

641
01:12:44,380 --> 01:12:45,680
It's fine.

642
01:12:46,130 --> 01:12:47,490
Good.

643
01:12:48,820 --> 01:12:50,290
And this milk?

644
01:12:50,540 --> 01:12:52,560
Oh, don't be silly. It's on me.

645
01:13:07,540 --> 01:13:08,410
Oh, thanks.

646
01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:16,770
Alright man.

647
01:13:17,020 --> 01:13:19,880
See ya. And get a haircut!

648
01:14:16,140 --> 01:14:18,520
I guess you want the top floor.

649
01:15:01,700 --> 01:15:03,130
Where did he go?

650
01:16:25,420 --> 01:16:26,530
You!

651
01:16:28,020 --> 01:16:29,890
What are you doing up there?

652
01:16:30,530 --> 01:16:31,670
Where?

653
01:16:32,140 --> 01:16:33,490
On the truck.

654
01:16:33,660 --> 01:16:34,850
Truck?

655
01:16:36,220 --> 01:16:37,520
Are you all right?

656
01:16:39,050 --> 01:16:40,250
What happened?

657
01:16:42,050 --> 01:16:43,190
I don't know.

658
01:16:43,570 --> 01:16:44,770
How are you?

659
01:16:46,460 --> 01:16:47,650
Fine...

660
01:16:48,530 --> 01:16:50,280
You want to come down?

661
01:16:50,540 --> 01:16:51,590
Down?

662
01:16:52,580 --> 01:16:54,120
From the truck.

663
01:17:01,780 --> 01:17:03,000
Thank you.

664
01:17:05,900 --> 01:17:07,730
What happened to you?

665
01:17:09,940 --> 01:17:12,490
You look like you need help.

666
01:17:17,780 --> 01:17:19,090
Where is Nid?

667
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:21,890
She's sleeping at the hotel.

668
01:17:22,650 --> 01:17:24,440
You're going to be alright?

669
01:17:24,620 --> 01:17:25,750
Yes...

670
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:28,250
... I miss Nid.

671
01:17:31,330 --> 01:17:33,200
She misses you too.

672
01:17:35,770 --> 01:17:37,680
You want to go see her?

673
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:39,550
Yes.

674
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:44,600
I have to go change first.

675
01:17:44,940 --> 01:17:46,600
- You know?
- Yeah.

676
01:17:46,940 --> 01:17:48,480
You have to change.

677
01:17:48,820 --> 01:17:50,410
I have to change.

678
01:17:50,580 --> 01:17:51,710
Okay.

679
01:17:52,340 --> 01:17:53,720
Okay.

680
01:18:58,290 --> 01:18:59,080
Hello.

681
01:18:59,290 --> 01:19:00,280
Hello, Khun Noi.
(Note.. Khun is like Madame in Thai)

682
01:19:00,490 --> 01:19:02,690
- Yes?
- Somebody waiting for you.

683
01:19:02,970 --> 01:19:04,240
Somebody waiting for me?

684
01:19:04,450 --> 01:19:05,570
Yeah.

685
01:19:05,820 --> 01:19:07,240
In the lobby.

686
01:19:07,810 --> 01:19:08,950
Okay.

687
01:19:11,290 --> 01:19:14,320
You go ahead. Room number 29.

688
01:19:14,660 --> 01:19:16,040
I'll be right back.

689
01:19:44,660 --> 01:19:46,210
There you are.

690
01:20:22,820 --> 01:20:25,610
Hello again. Long time no see.

691
01:20:27,220 --> 01:20:29,650
Time for a city tour!

692
01:20:32,410 --> 01:20:34,200
It's hot out there.

693
01:20:43,020 --> 01:20:44,290
Who are you?

694
01:20:46,890 --> 01:20:48,080
What?

695
01:20:48,580 --> 01:20:49,770
You are Lizard.

696
01:20:55,690 --> 01:20:57,960
You're not so stupid after all.

697
01:21:01,900 --> 01:21:03,610
The boss sent you to get rid of me.

698
01:21:04,130 --> 01:21:05,480
Nah.

699
01:21:05,690 --> 01:21:08,890
He sent me on vacation, just like you.

700
01:21:10,690 --> 01:21:11,830
You were on the cruise?

701
01:21:12,050 --> 01:21:13,770
I've been babysitting you, my man.

702
01:21:14,020 --> 01:21:15,440
Why?

703
01:21:16,540 --> 01:21:18,010
Why?

704
01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:22,090
Not because I like you, that's for sure.

705
01:21:25,650 --> 01:21:28,920
Why get rid of me? I did my job.

706
01:21:30,690 --> 01:21:32,320
And what job was that?

707
01:21:33,730 --> 01:21:35,760
Screwing Madame Seiko?

708
01:21:49,740 --> 01:21:52,450
He was going to get rid of me
no matter what.

709
01:21:55,490 --> 01:21:57,240
Why?

710
01:21:58,650 --> 01:22:04,330
You must be the stupidest
smart guy I have ever met.

711
01:22:07,650 --> 01:22:09,200
Okay...

712
01:22:09,460 --> 01:22:12,170
... Iet me tell you
a little fucking fairy tale, alright?

713
01:22:12,540 --> 01:22:14,770
There was a man.

714
01:22:15,050 --> 01:22:21,730
He had an affair with his boss's wife.

715
01:22:22,220 --> 01:22:24,680
He got caught.

716
01:22:24,930 --> 01:22:26,480
And just to save himself...

717
01:22:26,820 --> 01:22:29,330
... he agreed to kill the woman
he'd been fucking.

718
01:22:29,530 --> 01:22:31,010
By the way...

719
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:33,280
... this man was a real selfish bastard.

720
01:22:33,690 --> 01:22:40,850
Did he think killing Madame Seiko
would solve his problem?

721
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:44,770
Did he think it would be that simple?

722
01:22:46,410 --> 01:22:47,890
Anyway...

723
01:22:48,090 --> 01:22:51,490
... we are writing the ending
of this tale as we speak.

724
01:22:57,770 --> 01:23:00,730
Remember what I said about loyalty?

725
01:23:01,010 --> 01:23:04,550
Once you break it there's no going back.

726
01:23:04,810 --> 01:23:06,560
Sorry.

727
01:23:12,740 --> 01:23:14,570
What about Noi?

728
01:23:16,490 --> 01:23:18,360
Well, all I can say is...

729
01:23:18,890 --> 01:23:21,330
... you weren't supposed to meet her.

730
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:23,930
She was also sent on vacation.

731
01:23:24,180 --> 01:23:26,170
Just to clear things out
at home first, you know?

732
01:23:28,250 --> 01:23:31,600
You're a real trouble maker, aren't you?

733
01:23:31,940 --> 01:23:34,850
Creating problems for yourself
wherever you go.

734
01:23:35,050 --> 01:23:37,160
Even at sea!

735
01:23:37,690 --> 01:23:39,170
She's the boss's girl?

736
01:23:39,340 --> 01:23:40,530
None of our business.

737
01:23:40,730 --> 01:23:41,650
And the baby?

738
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:46,360
Would you shut up and let me sing?

739
01:23:56,380 --> 01:23:57,850
Now you're going to shoot me?

740
01:23:58,100 --> 01:24:00,290
Well, I could...

741
01:24:00,540 --> 01:24:01,960
... but I'm a bit tired tonight.

742
01:24:02,170 --> 01:24:04,470
So I'm just going to ask you nicely
to step into the sack.

743
01:24:04,660 --> 01:24:06,010
Then you'll shoot me.

744
01:24:06,210 --> 01:24:07,690
Actually, I'm not going to do anything.

745
01:24:07,940 --> 01:24:09,480
My boy there will do it.

746
01:24:12,290 --> 01:24:13,920
And then throw me in the sea or what?

747
01:24:15,380 --> 01:24:17,610
You really are a good guesser.

748
01:24:19,930 --> 01:24:23,630
Eventually they'll find my body
and it might lead them to the boss.

749
01:24:24,570 --> 01:24:27,360
You don't think we're just going to
throw you into the sea, do you?

750
01:24:27,570 --> 01:24:30,040
These boys may not look it...

751
01:24:30,290 --> 01:24:32,490
... but they're experts in their field.

752
01:24:40,180 --> 01:24:41,970
Sorry, man.

753
01:24:42,340 --> 01:24:44,840
I actually kind of like you.

754
01:24:45,180 --> 01:24:48,880
Then again...
I've done this to people I liked before.

755
01:24:55,530 --> 01:24:57,160
Okay!

756
01:24:57,370 --> 01:24:59,120
Kindly step into the sack.

757
01:25:09,900 --> 01:25:12,570
The stupider he gets the more I like him!

758
01:25:50,700 --> 01:25:53,210
Why did you make me do this?

759
01:25:56,530 --> 01:25:58,560
I'm so fuckin' depressed.

760
01:26:00,060 --> 01:26:04,130
I need a microphone.

761
01:26:59,330 --> 01:27:00,720
Hey, Mister Ghost.

762
01:27:02,220 --> 01:27:03,850
Did you sleep well?

763
01:27:06,100 --> 01:27:09,290
As a dead person,
I have to say you look quite healthy!

764
01:27:10,930 --> 01:27:14,470
I was just reading about
my own death in the paper.

765
01:27:14,940 --> 01:27:18,410
When I kept this I didn't know that
I'm keeping it for you.

766
01:27:18,660 --> 01:27:20,080
Were you sad?

767
01:27:20,580 --> 01:27:21,880
Did you cry?

768
01:27:22,140 --> 01:27:23,890
I was a bit upset.

769
01:27:24,820 --> 01:27:26,320
Just a bit?

770
01:27:28,890 --> 01:27:32,590
Well, my mind is very well-trained,
you know.

771
01:27:32,900 --> 01:27:34,560
But last night when I saw you,

772
01:27:34,770 --> 01:27:36,840
I really thought I see a ghost.

773
01:27:37,050 --> 01:27:38,960
But you didn't seem so scared.

774
01:27:39,170 --> 01:27:40,310
I wasn't.

775
01:27:40,530 --> 01:27:41,360
Why not?

776
01:27:41,540 --> 01:27:43,490
You're not afraid of ghosts?

777
01:27:43,690 --> 01:27:45,410
Not if you were the ghost.

778
01:27:45,580 --> 01:27:49,350
And when I thought you were dead
I kept asking you to come back and see me.

779
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:54,570
Well... I'm here.

780
01:28:07,620 --> 01:28:09,450
Are you hungry, darling?

781
01:28:09,620 --> 01:28:12,330
I'm fine. Don't worry about me.

782
01:28:15,130 --> 01:28:18,750
Now that you have come back to life,
and you have come back home.

783
01:28:19,010 --> 01:28:20,640
What do you want to do?

784
01:28:22,900 --> 01:28:25,000
I haven't come back to life.

785
01:28:25,530 --> 01:28:27,920
I'm not going to come back to life.

786
01:28:43,340 --> 01:28:46,290
Why don't we have dinner
somewhere nice tonight?

787
01:28:46,570 --> 01:28:49,680
I'd love to... but I have a friend to visit.

788
01:28:49,940 --> 01:28:51,440
So soon?

789
01:28:51,780 --> 01:28:53,080
Why wait?

790
01:28:56,370 --> 01:28:57,240
Hey...

791
01:28:57,420 --> 01:29:01,000
... you never wrote to me from Thailand
like what you said you would.

792
01:29:01,650 --> 01:29:04,000
No time to buy stamps.

793
01:29:22,890 --> 01:29:23,870
Hello, darling!

794
01:29:24,130 --> 01:29:25,970
Hello honey. Are you still jogging?

795
01:29:26,170 --> 01:29:28,410
Yes, I'm still here but I'm going back soon.

796
01:29:28,580 --> 01:29:30,330
Listen, I'm cooking some Thai food tonight.

797
01:29:30,530 --> 01:29:31,560
You're going to cook?

798
01:29:31,820 --> 01:29:34,450
- You'd like that?
- Great!

799
01:29:34,650 --> 01:29:37,440
- Anyway, see you at home. Bye.
- Okay. See ya!

800
01:31:34,180 --> 01:31:35,490
It's already loaded.

801
01:32:12,330 --> 01:32:13,550
I'll get it.

802
01:32:24,620 --> 01:32:26,090
Is he dead?

803
01:32:26,490 --> 01:32:28,000
Let me in.

804
01:32:29,100 --> 01:32:30,490
How did you get up here?

805
01:32:30,690 --> 01:32:32,080
There are ways.

806
01:32:32,970 --> 01:32:34,400
Step back.

807
01:32:44,220 --> 01:32:46,050
You know, you look great tonight.

808
01:32:46,300 --> 01:32:48,590
Are you going to
a dinner party somewhere?

809
01:32:49,140 --> 01:32:51,850
This... is my dinner party.

810
01:32:56,540 --> 01:32:58,250
Would you like some wine then?

811
01:32:58,740 --> 01:33:00,210
I want to talk first.

812
01:33:00,410 --> 01:33:01,770
Sit down.

813
01:33:08,210 --> 01:33:10,720
Listen, I have to stir the soup...

814
01:33:11,060 --> 01:33:12,360
... otherwise it's gonna get burned.

815
01:33:12,540 --> 01:33:13,650
No.

816
01:33:15,820 --> 01:33:18,160
Come on.
What do you think I'm going to do?

817
01:33:18,340 --> 01:33:19,320
Attack you?

818
01:33:19,530 --> 01:33:21,370
I'm not going to do anything. I promise.

819
01:33:21,570 --> 01:33:22,840
Stop.

820
01:33:25,100 --> 01:33:26,150
Kyoji...

821
01:33:26,820 --> 01:33:28,120
Don't you trust me?

822
01:33:29,010 --> 01:33:30,640
Of course not.

823
01:33:32,930 --> 01:33:34,070
Oh well...

824
01:33:34,540 --> 01:33:37,880
... then why don't you stir the soup for me?

825
01:33:38,740 --> 01:33:39,930
Okay?

826
01:33:55,700 --> 01:33:57,530
Smells good, doesn't it.

827
01:33:58,570 --> 01:34:00,770
- Listen, why don't you have some cigars?
- No.

828
01:34:01,450 --> 01:34:03,200
Just stay there.

829
01:34:11,890 --> 01:34:13,520
Did you enjoy your vacation?

830
01:34:14,050 --> 01:34:15,890
Don't try to be funny.

831
01:34:20,020 --> 01:34:21,970
So you've come to kill me?

832
01:34:22,140 --> 01:34:23,190
Yes.

833
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:29,450
Why didn't you stay away?

834
01:34:29,700 --> 01:34:32,160
Why do you want to start up trouble again?

835
01:34:32,660 --> 01:34:35,120
Because you must be punished.

836
01:34:39,420 --> 01:34:42,090
You know, I like you.

837
01:34:42,700 --> 01:34:44,760
You were quite a fine cook.

838
01:34:45,100 --> 01:34:46,690
You are also a pretty good chef.

839
01:34:46,940 --> 01:34:48,930
But you are an evil man.

840
01:34:49,450 --> 01:34:50,320
Evil?

841
01:34:52,250 --> 01:34:54,000
Pretty harsh word.

842
01:34:54,980 --> 01:34:57,010
You didn't have to kill me.

843
01:35:10,020 --> 01:35:13,410
It was bad enough that
you hired me to kill your wife.

844
01:35:13,610 --> 01:35:15,360
But you also betrayed me.

845
01:35:15,570 --> 01:35:17,320
Betrayed you?

846
01:35:19,090 --> 01:35:20,640
As far as I remember...

847
01:35:20,930 --> 01:35:24,330
... you were the one who was
fucking my wife behind my back...

848
01:35:24,530 --> 01:35:25,890
... for months.

849
01:35:26,090 --> 01:35:29,050
And now you come to me
and talk about betrayal?

850
01:35:29,220 --> 01:35:32,610
You could have just killed me
for having the affair.

851
01:35:32,890 --> 01:35:34,200
That, I would understand.

852
01:35:34,410 --> 01:35:36,010
But I murdered someone!

853
01:35:36,290 --> 01:35:37,320
Because of you!

854
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:38,440
Murder!

855
01:35:38,970 --> 01:35:40,520
Okay, calm down.

856
01:35:41,170 --> 01:35:42,920
We had a deal.

857
01:35:45,100 --> 01:35:46,130
Yes, we did.

858
01:35:46,330 --> 01:35:48,080
And then you broke the deal.

859
01:35:48,340 --> 01:35:51,010
I didn't know I was going to be killed.

860
01:35:53,570 --> 01:35:57,040
Well... it's cause and effect.

861
01:35:58,620 --> 01:36:02,480
You do something bad and then
something bad happens to you in return.

862
01:36:02,690 --> 01:36:04,320
Simple as that.

863
01:36:06,090 --> 01:36:07,320
Exactly.

864
01:36:07,980 --> 01:36:10,410
And that is why I am here tonight.

865
01:36:10,930 --> 01:36:14,240
I'm the something bad
that's gonna happen to you now.

866
01:36:17,140 --> 01:36:19,050
Hey, cigar?

867
01:36:19,300 --> 01:36:20,350
No.

868
01:36:24,370 --> 01:36:25,430
Well?

869
01:36:26,900 --> 01:36:28,170
It's fine.

870
01:36:33,300 --> 01:36:34,930
It's great.

871
01:36:35,930 --> 01:36:37,410
It's pretty good.

872
01:37:45,100 --> 01:37:46,210
I am in love.

873
01:37:47,730 --> 01:37:50,320
That's why I've been so happy lately.

874
01:37:51,060 --> 01:37:54,160
I'm not the type of person
who's afraid of death...

875
01:37:54,730 --> 01:37:56,450
... but right now...

876
01:37:56,730 --> 01:38:00,040
... I really want to enjoy
my new happiness...

877
01:38:00,450 --> 01:38:02,120
... with my girl.

878
01:38:03,130 --> 01:38:04,490
That's for Noi?

879
01:38:05,490 --> 01:38:07,090
Oh, yes.

880
01:38:07,460 --> 01:38:09,050
You know her too.

881
01:38:11,460 --> 01:38:14,250
You're going to ask her to marry you?

882
01:38:16,010 --> 01:38:17,000
Tonight.

883
01:38:27,100 --> 01:38:29,210
Are you going to shoot me with that gun?

884
01:38:30,700 --> 01:38:32,080
It's gonna be messy.

885
01:38:33,460 --> 01:38:36,010
No, I've brought something else.

886
01:38:40,530 --> 01:38:41,760
That's better.

887
01:38:42,890 --> 01:38:45,480
Very appropriate for a chef.

888
01:38:45,770 --> 01:38:48,840
It's the same bottle I used to kill Seiko.

889
01:38:59,370 --> 01:39:00,920
You sure you don't want some wine?

890
01:39:01,100 --> 01:39:02,290
No.

891
01:39:24,460 --> 01:39:26,840
You know, we don't have to do this.

892
01:39:27,180 --> 01:39:30,410
All can be forgotten and all can be happy.

893
01:39:31,810 --> 01:39:34,010
I can never be happy again.

894
01:39:34,380 --> 01:39:36,440
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

895
01:39:36,650 --> 01:39:38,320
Hey, darling, come here!

896
01:39:38,500 --> 01:39:39,370
I can't.

897
01:39:39,570 --> 01:39:40,440
Come on!

898
01:39:40,650 --> 01:39:43,290
No, really I can't. You stay inside.

899
01:39:43,660 --> 01:39:46,240
Nid just said something...

900
01:39:47,060 --> 01:39:48,600
Oh my god!

901
01:39:49,170 --> 01:39:50,440
You!

902
01:39:50,890 --> 01:39:52,160
Hello Noi.

903
01:39:53,020 --> 01:39:55,730
Well, I guess there's no need
for introduction.

904
01:39:57,900 --> 01:39:59,770
What are you doing here?

905
01:40:00,260 --> 01:40:03,650
Kyoji just came over to help us
make some soup. Right?

906
01:40:05,050 --> 01:40:06,600
With that gun?

907
01:40:07,050 --> 01:40:09,400
Why are you doing this?

908
01:40:10,340 --> 01:40:11,840
Does she know?

909
01:40:12,220 --> 01:40:13,410
Not everything.

910
01:40:13,660 --> 01:40:14,850
What?

911
01:40:22,540 --> 01:40:24,050
What is that?

912
01:40:24,250 --> 01:40:25,610
It's for you.

913
01:40:33,930 --> 01:40:35,640
You got that for me?

914
01:40:36,500 --> 01:40:37,520
Yes.

915
01:40:39,100 --> 01:40:42,050
But you're not supposed
to see it until after dessert.

916
01:40:46,100 --> 01:40:47,690
It's beautiful.

917
01:40:51,700 --> 01:40:53,250
What's going on?

918
01:40:54,290 --> 01:40:56,520
Is this some kind of joke?

919
01:41:33,090 --> 01:41:36,160
Yes, it's a joke.

920
01:41:37,260 --> 01:41:39,130
It's not funny.

921
01:41:40,250 --> 01:41:41,370
I'm sorry.

922
01:41:41,770 --> 01:41:44,160
I have a weird sense of humor.

923
01:41:45,210 --> 01:41:46,920
Would you like some wine now?

924
01:41:47,100 --> 01:41:48,600
Oh sure.

925
01:41:49,540 --> 01:41:52,320
Honey, would you pour us
some wine, please?

926
01:42:31,260 --> 01:42:34,210
Maybe we can see you
some other time soon.

927
01:42:35,580 --> 01:42:37,170
Some other time.

928
01:42:41,180 --> 01:42:42,850
Do you have stamps?

929
01:42:43,250 --> 01:42:44,610
Stamps?

930
01:43:25,290 --> 01:43:26,880
Hello, old friend.

931
01:43:27,220 --> 01:43:29,120
I was waiting for you.

932
01:43:30,980 --> 01:43:33,760
To tell you the truth,
I'm really lazy tonight.

933
01:43:34,020 --> 01:43:36,690
Not in the mood
for this sort of thing at all.

934
01:43:37,780 --> 01:43:39,320
How about karaoke?

935
01:43:42,460 --> 01:43:44,370
That's exactly what I was doing...

936
01:43:44,570 --> 01:43:46,920
... when the boss called.

937
01:43:48,900 --> 01:43:51,050
You are very loyal.

938
01:43:55,450 --> 01:43:57,750
That is one thing I'm proud of.

939
01:43:59,010 --> 01:44:02,760
Good for you.
I have nothing to be proud of yet.

940
01:44:35,100 --> 01:44:36,890
You plan to go back home and sleep?

941
01:44:37,140 --> 01:44:38,920
And tomorrow start a new life?

942
01:44:39,540 --> 01:44:41,600
Not exactly.

943
01:44:41,810 --> 01:44:45,050
I'm just going to take a walk.

944
01:44:45,540 --> 01:44:47,530
There is no home to go back to.

945
01:44:50,020 --> 01:44:53,250
You know this walk
has to end sometime, right?

946
01:44:53,650 --> 01:44:55,040
I know.

947
01:44:55,930 --> 01:44:58,400
And it will end soon.

948
01:45:02,740 --> 01:45:03,770
Yes.

949
01:45:08,570 --> 01:45:10,280
But will you let it end?

950
01:45:13,330 --> 01:45:14,550
Yes.

951
01:45:58,330 --> 01:46:00,160
How many times
have you crossed this water?

952
01:46:00,500 --> 01:46:02,600
A lot.

953
01:46:02,940 --> 01:46:04,320
Will you miss it?

954
01:46:05,210 --> 01:46:06,840
I guess either I will find out now...

955
01:46:07,020 --> 01:46:08,610
... or else I'll never know.

956
01:46:11,650 --> 01:46:13,640
You sorry you didn't get your revenge?

957
01:46:15,730 --> 01:46:18,840
I realized I have nothing to get revenge for.

958
01:46:19,220 --> 01:46:21,970
No one really hurt me.

959
01:46:24,900 --> 01:46:26,570
Not even the boss?

960
01:46:32,780 --> 01:46:33,970
No...

961
01:46:34,220 --> 01:46:37,890
... he just didn't let me know
certain things...

962
01:46:38,260 --> 01:46:40,550
... that I should have known myself.

963
01:46:42,380 --> 01:46:44,840
You could have killed him tonight.

964
01:46:45,210 --> 01:46:46,690
Sure, I could've.

965
01:46:46,890 --> 01:46:48,440
I wanted to.

966
01:46:51,010 --> 01:46:52,600
Why didn't you?

967
01:46:54,970 --> 01:46:57,920
He seemed so happy. Very happy.

968
01:47:07,290 --> 01:47:10,000
That's your reason for not getting revenge?

969
01:47:12,660 --> 01:47:15,890
Who do you think deserves to live more?

970
01:47:16,930 --> 01:47:18,600
A happy man...

971
01:47:18,810 --> 01:47:21,840
... or a homeless ghost?

972
01:47:31,250 --> 01:47:33,040
I see.

973
01:47:34,330 --> 01:47:36,560
In a way, I envy you.

974
01:47:37,210 --> 01:47:38,480
About what?

975
01:47:40,570 --> 01:47:44,080
I always wonder what the end will be like.

976
01:47:44,490 --> 01:47:47,170
You're about to know.

977
01:47:48,900 --> 01:47:50,120
You think it really matters?

978
01:47:50,330 --> 01:47:52,290
Yes, it does...

979
01:47:52,540 --> 01:47:55,360
... but I'm in no rush to be sure.

980
01:47:57,620 --> 01:47:59,330
Right.

981
01:48:08,890 --> 01:48:10,400
It's getting late.

982
01:48:10,660 --> 01:48:12,160
I don't want to keep you.

983
01:48:13,330 --> 01:48:15,040
It's my pleasure.

984
01:48:16,540 --> 01:48:17,760
But...

985
01:48:19,050 --> 01:48:20,960
... I guess it's gotta end sometime.

986
01:48:27,020 --> 01:48:28,850
Any last words?

987
01:48:34,460 --> 01:48:37,250
Could you mail this postcard for me?

988
01:48:37,740 --> 01:48:39,330
I'll leave it right here.

989
01:48:49,340 --> 01:48:50,400
No problem.

990
01:48:51,140 --> 01:48:52,920
Have you put a stamp on it?

991
01:48:54,970 --> 01:48:56,400
It helps.
