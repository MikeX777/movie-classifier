1
00:01:33,561 --> 00:01:35,441
- Thank you.
- Shall I come up?

2
00:01:35,561 --> 00:01:37,801
No. You've already done enough.

3
00:01:50,361 --> 00:01:53,161
A BREAK

4
00:01:55,441 --> 00:01:57,441
No. I'm out of gas.

5
00:01:58,401 --> 00:02:00,641
I'm at a garage.
There's nothing.

6
00:02:00,761 --> 00:02:03,601
There's only...
There's no diesel.

7
00:02:06,121 --> 00:02:09,641
You'll have to come and get me.
I'm stuck otherwise.

8
00:02:09,801 --> 00:02:12,881
I'm in a filling station
with no diesel.

9
00:02:14,161 --> 00:02:15,001
Shit!

10
00:02:15,561 --> 00:02:17,721
My battery's nearly dead!
Quick!

11
00:02:19,761 --> 00:02:21,081
Shit...

12
00:02:21,281 --> 00:02:24,481
Can I borrow
your mobile for a second?

13
00:02:25,361 --> 00:02:27,081
Haven't got one. Sorry.

14
00:02:27,321 --> 00:02:30,161
Do you know
where the new squat is?

15
00:02:31,801 --> 00:02:33,361
No, I don't. Sorry.

16
00:02:33,561 --> 00:02:34,681
Are you sure?

17
00:02:35,361 --> 00:02:36,561
Yes. I'm sure.

18
00:02:40,321 --> 00:02:41,521
It's nothing.

19
00:02:42,481 --> 00:02:44,321
- Pardon?
- It's nothing.

20
00:02:46,081 --> 00:02:47,601
I didn't catch that.

21
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:49,241
I said "it's nothing".

22
00:02:54,681 --> 00:02:55,521
Hang on.

23
00:02:57,321 --> 00:02:59,321
I've got a map in the car.

24
00:03:05,481 --> 00:03:07,121
Do you live in here?

25
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:09,961
My girlfriend
threw me out of our place.

26
00:03:10,121 --> 00:03:11,321
Well, her place.

27
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,881
So I'm dossing here.

28
00:03:17,241 --> 00:03:18,561
I don't know why...

29
00:03:20,761 --> 00:03:22,041
It doesn't matter.

30
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:32,121
Shall we look for this squat?

31
00:03:32,281 --> 00:03:34,401
It's not a problem for you?

32
00:03:35,201 --> 00:03:36,281
No.

33
00:03:55,241 --> 00:03:56,881
What's your name?

34
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:59,241
- Sami. And yours?
- Julia.

35
00:04:00,321 --> 00:04:03,121
- Can I smoke in your place?
- Yeah.

36
00:04:10,401 --> 00:04:12,881
- Do you make music?
- Yep.

37
00:04:13,481 --> 00:04:14,761
Can I listen?

38
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:58,281
What happened with your girlfriend?

39
00:04:58,401 --> 00:04:59,721
It lasted 4 years.

40
00:05:00,921 --> 00:05:02,401
What does that mean,

41
00:05:02,561 --> 00:05:03,881
"it lasted 4 years"?

42
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:06,281
Ever been with someone 4 years?

43
00:05:06,881 --> 00:05:08,001
Well, no.

44
00:05:08,121 --> 00:05:10,761
There's generally
a good reason for it.

45
00:05:11,761 --> 00:05:13,681
No more than for meeting.

46
00:05:43,881 --> 00:05:45,041
Sniff it!

47
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:10,321
4 years later

48
00:07:20,681 --> 00:07:22,921
Yes. Fine.

49
00:07:23,121 --> 00:07:26,441
Just one thing.
About dinner, Wednesday night,

50
00:07:26,641 --> 00:07:27,881
I can't make it.

51
00:07:28,001 --> 00:07:30,241
Can you do tomorrow?

52
00:07:30,361 --> 00:07:31,561
Wait, I'll check.

53
00:07:36,361 --> 00:07:39,001
He's coming tomorrow.
Wednesday's off.

54
00:07:39,121 --> 00:07:41,201
- Who?
- Lionel, my boss.

55
00:07:41,321 --> 00:07:42,521
Oh yeah?

56
00:07:42,681 --> 00:07:45,121
- Does it suit you?
- Why shouldn't it?

57
00:07:45,241 --> 00:07:46,801
I don't know...

58
00:07:53,361 --> 00:07:54,441
You alright?

59
00:07:54,561 --> 00:07:57,401
- Yes. 7 out of 10. And you?
- 8.5.

60
00:07:57,561 --> 00:08:00,361
We got the Co-op contract. Yes!

61
00:08:05,921 --> 00:08:07,281
How's Fernand?

62
00:08:08,081 --> 00:08:09,081
Same as ever.

63
00:08:10,441 --> 00:08:12,441
What time's your meeting?

64
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,681
Nothing's fixed.

65
00:08:15,721 --> 00:08:18,281
I've got an idea for a song.

66
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:22,601
Here it is.

67
00:08:25,241 --> 00:08:27,761
"When the stars are shaking."

68
00:08:28,961 --> 00:08:30,121
Nice, eh?

69
00:08:45,001 --> 00:08:48,641
I'll drop you at Celine's,
you'll come to the concert?

70
00:08:59,961 --> 00:09:02,841
- Will you eat tonight?
- No. Thank you.

71
00:09:26,161 --> 00:09:27,761
- Hi, Sami.
- Hi, Sarah.

72
00:09:27,921 --> 00:09:28,761
Is he there?

73
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:30,761
Fernand!

74
00:09:30,921 --> 00:09:32,401
Fernand, your jab!

75
00:09:33,001 --> 00:09:34,801
Bloody prostate!

76
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:38,521
Take my advice,
piss sitting down.

77
00:10:05,641 --> 00:10:07,961
- I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.

78
00:10:08,081 --> 00:10:10,921
Lionel came to Celine's.
He left late.

79
00:10:11,081 --> 00:10:12,241
Why at Celine's?

80
00:10:12,441 --> 00:10:15,521
To... celebrate the contract!

81
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:16,761
Are you drunk?

82
00:10:17,961 --> 00:10:19,201
A little bit.

83
00:10:19,361 --> 00:10:22,441
The Madras suppliers
are coming to Switzerland.

84
00:10:23,801 --> 00:10:24,801
Prat alert.

85
00:10:25,921 --> 00:10:27,041
Hi, guys!

86
00:10:27,201 --> 00:10:28,841
Just brilliant.

87
00:10:29,001 --> 00:10:31,281
Sami, you've got an ear for a hit.

88
00:10:31,441 --> 00:10:33,841
Shame you only play country.

89
00:10:33,961 --> 00:10:35,521
Let's fix a date.

90
00:10:37,281 --> 00:10:38,841
I've got a slot...

91
00:10:39,521 --> 00:10:40,801
on Tuesday morning.

92
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:44,081
- Can you make that?
- Not Tuesday.

93
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:46,361
I've got a prostate thing.

94
00:10:47,721 --> 00:10:49,241
Right, then...

95
00:10:50,241 --> 00:10:52,001
Right. Then forget it.

96
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:55,041
OK. We'll make it happen.

97
00:10:55,561 --> 00:10:56,681
Yeah, guys!

98
00:10:57,641 --> 00:10:58,521
- Tuesday!
- Yep.

99
00:10:59,601 --> 00:11:00,841
See you then!

100
00:11:11,081 --> 00:11:12,201
Ciao, Rudi!

101
00:11:13,801 --> 00:11:15,321
You good, Big Chief?

102
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:17,681
- Cool, and you?
- Not bad, man.

103
00:11:18,401 --> 00:11:19,521
Julia.

104
00:11:22,161 --> 00:11:23,561
You're really crazy.

105
00:11:25,921 --> 00:11:27,521
No. I'm just polite.

106
00:11:32,281 --> 00:11:33,521
You're beautiful.

107
00:11:35,921 --> 00:11:38,441
In this light, it's unreal.

108
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:51,641
I'm not in the mood.

109
00:11:58,841 --> 00:12:01,721
Can I...
While I look at your bum?

110
00:12:03,721 --> 00:12:04,841
No.

111
00:12:28,521 --> 00:12:30,241
It's peaceful here.

112
00:12:32,241 --> 00:12:34,961
I'd take a room,
if I could afford it.

113
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:39,561
- Shall we play?
- I'd rather drink.

114
00:12:42,281 --> 00:12:43,881
It's a nice Burgundy.

115
00:12:45,801 --> 00:12:47,401
And some more!

116
00:12:47,521 --> 00:12:48,601
More?

117
00:13:12,441 --> 00:13:14,681
Hi!
Join me? It's still warm.

118
00:13:16,401 --> 00:13:20,041
My boss is coming tonight.
I asked you to tidy.

119
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:22,081
Shit, yes.

120
00:13:29,321 --> 00:13:32,561
Where are the 2 bottles of Burgundy?

121
00:13:33,881 --> 00:13:35,361
Artistic inspiration?

122
00:13:35,521 --> 00:13:37,561
I'll go and buy 2 more.

123
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:41,521
- Try to avoid plonk.
- OK.

124
00:13:48,201 --> 00:13:49,281
Here.

125
00:13:49,921 --> 00:13:51,041
Thanks.

126
00:13:57,401 --> 00:13:59,241
- What's that?
- A decanter.

127
00:13:59,361 --> 00:14:02,561
Don't use a water jug!
Take a carafe!

128
00:14:03,721 --> 00:14:04,721
Yeah.

129
00:14:06,321 --> 00:14:09,601
Why Australian wine?
With prawns, it'll look bad.

130
00:14:09,721 --> 00:14:12,001
You won't get an official warning!

131
00:14:12,161 --> 00:14:14,761
Being this ecologically correct
is crazy.

132
00:14:14,881 --> 00:14:16,441
Really, it's a pain.

133
00:14:17,121 --> 00:14:20,601
- Is this on purpose?
- I'm handling it.

134
00:14:20,721 --> 00:14:23,601
Don't use the curtains!
Are you stupid?

135
00:14:23,721 --> 00:14:25,401
- Get out!
- I'll do it...

136
00:14:25,561 --> 00:14:28,561
Stop. You're annoying me.
Go and change.

137
00:14:29,241 --> 00:14:32,921
Shall I wear a tie too?
This new job's driven you mad.

138
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:37,001
It's better than writing crap
with a senile mate!

139
00:14:40,561 --> 00:14:44,281
Julia, Thank you so much
for a delicious meal.

140
00:14:44,401 --> 00:14:47,001
- The prawns are superb.
- Thank you.

141
00:14:47,121 --> 00:14:49,921
I've been looking forward
to having you here.

142
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:53,761
When I was a kid,
I dreamed of being in space,

143
00:14:53,881 --> 00:14:55,401
looking at earth,

144
00:14:55,601 --> 00:14:58,521
which shrivelled to
the size of a pinhead.

145
00:14:58,681 --> 00:15:01,521
The infinitely large
to the infinitely small.

146
00:15:02,561 --> 00:15:04,441
And I woke up screaming.

147
00:15:05,401 --> 00:15:06,961
Why are you saying that?

148
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,161
I don't know.

149
00:15:09,921 --> 00:15:11,081
It's the prawns.

150
00:15:12,121 --> 00:15:13,801
They reminded me of it.

151
00:15:17,681 --> 00:15:19,321
Are you acting?

152
00:15:20,401 --> 00:15:21,401
Yes, I am.

153
00:15:21,561 --> 00:15:22,721
What is it?

154
00:15:22,841 --> 00:15:26,121
A poetic fable on the impact
of global warming.

155
00:15:26,241 --> 00:15:27,161
Show her.

156
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:31,441
It's a metaphor on sexual politics.

157
00:15:32,161 --> 00:15:33,041
No dialogue.

158
00:15:33,561 --> 00:15:34,361
Right.

159
00:15:34,521 --> 00:15:37,361
It's full of surprise elements.

160
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:40,841
The actors change their character

161
00:15:41,001 --> 00:15:42,201
within the play.

162
00:15:42,361 --> 00:15:45,601
What's that Brechtian technique?

163
00:15:46,561 --> 00:15:49,001
Verfremdungseffekt.

164
00:15:49,121 --> 00:15:50,081
The V-Effekt.

165
00:15:50,281 --> 00:15:51,641
What is... What?

166
00:15:51,761 --> 00:15:53,321
Hang on.
I know that...

167
00:15:54,081 --> 00:15:56,521
The idea is to make...

168
00:15:57,881 --> 00:15:59,481
the spectator realise

169
00:15:59,641 --> 00:16:01,721
that he's in the middle...

170
00:16:01,841 --> 00:16:03,441
In the middle of...

171
00:16:04,721 --> 00:16:07,121
watching a play.
- Exactly. That's it.

172
00:16:07,321 --> 00:16:10,521
It gives a sense of
political distance.

173
00:16:10,641 --> 00:16:13,121
Yes.
You really must come.

174
00:16:13,281 --> 00:16:15,361
The opening's next Friday?

175
00:16:15,481 --> 00:16:16,601
I'd love to.

176
00:16:16,801 --> 00:16:19,441
- You don't have to.
- No. I don't.

177
00:16:19,601 --> 00:16:22,201
But however it's presented,

178
00:16:22,441 --> 00:16:25,841
it's good that theatre
is talking about the planet.

179
00:16:29,841 --> 00:16:32,521
Sami, you play guitar, don't you?

180
00:16:32,681 --> 00:16:34,841
- Yes.
- May I?

181
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:37,841
Feel free.
It's not easy to play.

182
00:16:56,481 --> 00:16:58,241
What else do you do?

183
00:17:00,441 --> 00:17:03,841
Not a lot. Small jobs.
I'm not ambitious.

184
00:17:06,161 --> 00:17:07,081
Each to his own.

185
00:17:07,241 --> 00:17:09,841
At the moment,
I'm in local commerce...

186
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:12,681
Could you pour us
some more wine?

187
00:17:14,401 --> 00:17:15,561
Yes.

188
00:17:17,401 --> 00:17:18,801
It's Australian.

189
00:17:18,921 --> 00:17:22,241
But no kangaroos were harmed
during its making!

190
00:17:25,881 --> 00:17:27,921
- A drop?
- Yes.

191
00:17:29,801 --> 00:17:31,561
But for fundamentalists,

192
00:17:31,681 --> 00:17:34,081
there's some local plonk left.

193
00:17:51,161 --> 00:17:52,361
Can we talk?

194
00:17:52,961 --> 00:17:55,281
- Right now?
- Yes, but not here.

195
00:18:02,841 --> 00:18:05,081
Sorry about earlier.
You angry?

196
00:18:05,201 --> 00:18:06,241
No.

197
00:18:06,921 --> 00:18:08,161
What's up?

198
00:18:09,641 --> 00:18:11,801
It's not working any more.

199
00:18:12,921 --> 00:18:14,441
How do you mean?

200
00:18:16,441 --> 00:18:18,041
There's no understanding.

201
00:18:19,121 --> 00:18:22,441
What?
What don't you understand?

202
00:18:25,681 --> 00:18:26,561
Everything.

203
00:18:26,721 --> 00:18:29,681
A couple's never all plain sailing.

204
00:18:34,241 --> 00:18:37,521
I screwed up earlier.
Is it about Lionel?

205
00:18:38,401 --> 00:18:39,401
No, it's not.

206
00:18:39,881 --> 00:18:41,161
So explain.

207
00:18:43,601 --> 00:18:45,201
I don't know you, Sami.

208
00:18:46,201 --> 00:18:47,281
5 years now.

209
00:18:47,401 --> 00:18:50,241
You don't know me,
or what I like.

210
00:18:50,361 --> 00:18:52,601
You don't like my friends.

211
00:18:52,801 --> 00:18:55,841
We choose to do different things,
don't we?

212
00:18:56,241 --> 00:18:57,881
Yes. But I've had enough.

213
00:18:58,001 --> 00:18:59,921
Your freedom is vital to me.

214
00:19:00,081 --> 00:19:03,241
If you've had enough,
you should leave me!

215
00:19:03,361 --> 00:19:04,681
But 4 years on...

216
00:19:04,841 --> 00:19:06,361
That suits you fine!

217
00:19:07,361 --> 00:19:09,521
That history repeats itself?

218
00:19:09,641 --> 00:19:11,721
My leaving you, prat!

219
00:19:12,961 --> 00:19:14,881
It doesn't suit me at all.

220
00:19:16,561 --> 00:19:19,641
Finding someone else,
the initial jealousy,

221
00:19:19,761 --> 00:19:21,681
awkwardness, passion, all that...

222
00:19:21,881 --> 00:19:23,401
No, I don't need it.

223
00:19:24,641 --> 00:19:25,841
So...

224
00:19:26,001 --> 00:19:27,601
So do something then!

225
00:19:27,721 --> 00:19:29,241
What do you want?

226
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:32,601
Well, you could say:
"Julia...

227
00:19:32,761 --> 00:19:36,521
"I'm scared of losing you,
so I've kept you away.

228
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:40,641
"Then if it goes wrong,
it'll hurt me less."

229
00:19:43,801 --> 00:19:45,961
Yes... It must be that.

230
00:19:46,881 --> 00:19:49,521
- What's "that"?
- What you just said.

231
00:19:53,681 --> 00:19:55,521
Do you want to have a child?

232
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:16,081
Julia!

233
00:20:27,761 --> 00:20:30,041
It's your hair in the plughole.

234
00:20:35,721 --> 00:20:37,601
"Yesterday, around 5pm,

235
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,933
"an Airbus A330
crashed into the Atlantic.

236
00:20:42,013 --> 00:20:44,320
"The flight,
between Montreal and London,

237
00:20:44,481 --> 00:20:47,641
"was carrying 2 classes
of school children.

238
00:20:47,761 --> 00:20:50,161
"The Canadian prime minister said:

239
00:20:50,321 --> 00:20:53,161
"this is a national tragedy'"

240
00:20:55,841 --> 00:21:00,401
What do you want?
I've got cognac, armagnac, vodka,

241
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:02,201
absinthe,

242
00:21:02,401 --> 00:21:05,721
red wine, white wine, beer.

243
00:21:07,361 --> 00:21:09,761
- The Macallan?
- I'm not thirsty.

244
00:21:12,201 --> 00:21:13,721
You're lucky, Fernand.

245
00:21:14,401 --> 00:21:15,161
Why?

246
00:21:16,761 --> 00:21:17,841
It's behind you.

247
00:21:18,001 --> 00:21:20,881
All the stupidity,
It's finished for you.

248
00:21:21,521 --> 00:21:23,881
It depends how you look at it.

249
00:21:26,281 --> 00:21:27,681
What's happened?

250
00:21:27,801 --> 00:21:29,641
I've fallen out with Julia.

251
00:21:29,801 --> 00:21:31,361
Over a bath.

252
00:21:32,761 --> 00:21:33,921
Shall we play?

253
00:21:34,521 --> 00:21:36,081
I need to fill the gap.

254
00:22:39,521 --> 00:22:42,201
I'm doing dinner
and can't find the sieve.

255
00:22:42,321 --> 00:22:44,121
Where did you put it?

256
00:22:44,281 --> 00:22:47,961
It'll be ready soon.
Just say if you're coming or not.

257
00:22:49,241 --> 00:22:50,641
Sorry.

258
00:22:51,321 --> 00:22:53,761
Big hugs and kisses.

259
00:23:12,761 --> 00:23:14,881
Look, I really like your music,

260
00:23:15,041 --> 00:23:18,801
but I'd like you
to consider the other residents.

261
00:23:18,921 --> 00:23:21,041
They're deaf and half blind.

262
00:23:21,201 --> 00:23:22,721
With no marbles!

263
00:23:22,841 --> 00:23:25,761
I don't know what's wrong
with him today...

264
00:23:25,881 --> 00:23:27,481
I'll deal with him.

265
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:32,801
Could you apply his cream, please?

266
00:23:34,481 --> 00:23:35,481
- What?
- Nothing.

267
00:23:42,601 --> 00:23:45,361
She's not back yet.
But it's alright.

268
00:23:45,521 --> 00:23:47,201
It's rather a good sign.

269
00:23:47,401 --> 00:23:48,681
"Good sign"?

270
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:52,281
- You joking? What do I do?
- Nothing.

271
00:23:53,121 --> 00:23:54,881
Not straight away, anyway.

272
00:23:55,241 --> 00:23:56,681
Let her stew.

273
00:23:57,401 --> 00:23:59,361
She'll realise that she cares,

274
00:23:59,561 --> 00:24:03,161
then she'll fall in love
with you all over again.

275
00:24:04,841 --> 00:24:09,001
I know women.
You've got to make her miss you.

276
00:24:50,481 --> 00:24:54,881
Look, Sami. All I know,
is that it's been a while

277
00:24:55,041 --> 00:24:58,321
that Julia's been saying
that it's not working.

278
00:24:58,441 --> 00:25:01,641
Besides that, she's said nothing.
Honest.

279
00:25:01,761 --> 00:25:03,721
I don't know what to say.

280
00:25:03,881 --> 00:25:05,801
Is there someone else?

281
00:25:06,561 --> 00:25:08,841
- Is that what counts?
- No.

282
00:25:09,001 --> 00:25:12,361
- That's not the case.
- You said you knew nothing?

283
00:25:12,481 --> 00:25:15,561
Look. I've got a pile
of exam papers to mark.

284
00:25:15,761 --> 00:25:20,121
If you want my advice,
think about your senile mate.

285
00:25:20,281 --> 00:25:22,521
What's he got to do with it?

286
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:24,681
You think it's fun?

287
00:25:25,641 --> 00:25:29,241
A guy who spends his time
in a retirement home,

288
00:25:29,401 --> 00:25:30,761
and hasn't got a job?

289
00:25:41,641 --> 00:25:44,401
On page 2, article 5...

290
00:25:44,521 --> 00:25:46,281
The best thing,

291
00:25:46,441 --> 00:25:49,201
is that the dockets
are certified by customs.

292
00:25:49,641 --> 00:25:53,041
Then the whole process
is traceable.

293
00:25:53,201 --> 00:25:54,241
Excuse me, please.

294
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:58,481
Sorry.
You can't just turn up here.

295
00:25:58,641 --> 00:25:59,881
We're with clients.

296
00:26:00,041 --> 00:26:01,881
I can see. I'll wait

297
00:26:03,001 --> 00:26:06,481
Sami, I know
it's none of my business,

298
00:26:06,641 --> 00:26:09,361
but I think you should
leave her alone.

299
00:26:09,481 --> 00:26:10,481
It's best.

300
00:26:10,641 --> 00:26:12,881
Correct.
It's not your business.

301
00:26:13,041 --> 00:26:15,201
- What do you want?
- To know.

302
00:26:15,361 --> 00:26:16,561
It's a bad time.

303
00:26:16,721 --> 00:26:19,041
You haven't called for 82 hours.

304
00:26:19,201 --> 00:26:20,041
Are you deaf?

305
00:26:20,201 --> 00:26:23,121
Not yet.
Sign the contract, I'll wait.

306
00:26:24,001 --> 00:26:25,041
Julia...

307
00:26:25,521 --> 00:26:27,081
have you got a paper?

308
00:26:28,641 --> 00:26:31,841
If you want to see me again,
just leave. OK?

309
00:26:32,001 --> 00:26:33,161
You crazy or...?

310
00:26:33,281 --> 00:26:34,761
It's over, Sami.

311
00:26:35,361 --> 00:26:37,561
Got it? "Over."

312
00:26:46,001 --> 00:26:49,001
Don't worry.
It's not serious.

313
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:52,121
She didn't say she needed a break.

314
00:26:52,281 --> 00:26:55,081
When they say they need a break,

315
00:26:55,281 --> 00:27:00,161
then you've got a reason to worry
as they're trying to protect you.

316
00:27:00,281 --> 00:27:02,961
But if she only said it was over...

317
00:27:04,441 --> 00:27:07,001
It's OK.
You just arrived at a bad time.

318
00:27:07,201 --> 00:27:08,401
Go on.

319
00:27:11,841 --> 00:27:12,841
It's certain,

320
00:27:13,361 --> 00:27:16,761
that to make her miss you,
you mustn't see her.

321
00:27:24,361 --> 00:27:25,681
Frankly...

322
00:27:27,441 --> 00:27:29,961
I had doubts over your country crap.

323
00:27:30,721 --> 00:27:35,361
But the record industry
is in such a state...

324
00:27:36,521 --> 00:27:40,521
Your Willie Nelson cover
appealed to the English.

325
00:27:41,881 --> 00:27:45,521
Well, he was totally pissed!
We really caned it!

326
00:27:45,721 --> 00:27:46,641
Whisky...

327
00:27:46,801 --> 00:27:49,081
No, no...

328
00:27:49,241 --> 00:27:52,401
It's not very rock'n roll,
but you can't smoke.

329
00:27:54,121 --> 00:27:55,841
So, this is the score...

330
00:27:57,521 --> 00:28:00,201
You're booked on a short tour.

331
00:28:00,841 --> 00:28:03,561
Support act for the English group.
Good, eh?

332
00:28:04,241 --> 00:28:05,761
Brilliant!

333
00:28:06,361 --> 00:28:07,161
It's good.

334
00:28:23,561 --> 00:28:24,761
Hello!

335
00:28:32,401 --> 00:28:33,761
I bought some beer.

336
00:28:37,681 --> 00:28:38,481
Want one?

337
00:28:42,281 --> 00:28:45,201
Sorry to have vanished for 2 days.

338
00:28:45,361 --> 00:28:47,201
I should've let you know.

339
00:28:47,361 --> 00:28:48,601
It doesn't matter.

340
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,441
Shall I cook something?

341
00:28:53,201 --> 00:28:54,601
Look, Sami...

342
00:28:55,881 --> 00:28:57,801
I think we need a break.

343
00:29:02,401 --> 00:29:04,081
"A break"? In what way?

344
00:29:04,241 --> 00:29:05,241
Well...

345
00:29:06,201 --> 00:29:08,361
I'm going to stay with Celine.

346
00:29:08,521 --> 00:29:10,161
Have you met someone?

347
00:29:11,241 --> 00:29:13,001
You can tell me. It's OK.

348
00:29:15,481 --> 00:29:17,441
Don't you love me anymore?

349
00:29:21,441 --> 00:29:24,561
I don't know.
I'm searching. But you're not.

350
00:30:19,161 --> 00:30:22,641
- What's going on?
- It's Julia's mail.

351
00:30:22,801 --> 00:30:25,361
But Sami, it's 6 in the morning!

352
00:30:25,561 --> 00:30:26,521
Shit!

353
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:31,921
What is it?

354
00:30:32,081 --> 00:30:35,041
I wanted you to have
your Elle at breakfast.

355
00:30:35,241 --> 00:30:36,801
and your other mail.

356
00:30:38,801 --> 00:30:41,121
- Sorry.
- What do you want?

357
00:30:41,281 --> 00:30:43,961
Sorry for my attitude recently,

358
00:30:44,121 --> 00:30:46,721
I'm really not happy
with this situation.

359
00:30:46,921 --> 00:30:50,441
You're right, things are bad.
We must do something.

360
00:30:51,601 --> 00:30:54,081
So... What do you plan on doing?

361
00:30:57,201 --> 00:31:01,681
We could go walking,
go into the valley.

362
00:31:02,601 --> 00:31:04,201
"Go into the valley"?

363
00:31:04,361 --> 00:31:07,441
I told you I wanted a break.

364
00:31:07,641 --> 00:31:08,681
How does it work?

365
00:31:08,841 --> 00:31:10,841
We avoid each other for a bit.

366
00:31:11,001 --> 00:31:12,801
- Until when?
- I don't know.

367
00:31:12,961 --> 00:31:13,961
You don't know?

368
00:31:14,161 --> 00:31:15,681
- I've no idea.
- Why not?

369
00:31:15,841 --> 00:31:17,641
I'll call you. Goodbye.

370
00:31:22,441 --> 00:31:24,041
OK. I'll be waiting.

371
00:32:40,241 --> 00:32:42,681
- What is it?
- Blood test.

372
00:32:42,881 --> 00:32:45,241
You missed the 'genius at work' sign?

373
00:32:53,321 --> 00:32:56,881
Sing it more laid-back,
with a bit more soul.

374
00:32:57,641 --> 00:32:58,961
Got sticky fingers.

375
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:02,361
I don't believe
this affair with Lionel.

376
00:33:02,561 --> 00:33:03,681
What affair?

377
00:33:03,841 --> 00:33:05,601
It's a fling, purely sexual.

378
00:33:05,761 --> 00:33:08,601
She wanted to have
a fling with her boss.

379
00:33:08,761 --> 00:33:09,561
What?

380
00:33:10,001 --> 00:33:12,601
You said she wanted
a fling with him.

381
00:33:13,601 --> 00:33:14,641
No, I didn't.

382
00:33:14,801 --> 00:33:18,361
I said that I thought
something might be going on.

383
00:33:18,881 --> 00:33:21,001
Right. Excuse me.

384
00:33:23,281 --> 00:33:25,001
Write. You're in the mood.

385
00:33:25,161 --> 00:33:27,761
It's an ideal time to compose.

386
00:33:28,801 --> 00:33:31,441
Imagine her screwing this bloke.

387
00:34:11,121 --> 00:34:13,081
I've got an idea for a song.

388
00:34:16,441 --> 00:34:19,001
"When the stars are shaking."

389
00:34:20,201 --> 00:34:21,401
Nice, eh?

390
00:35:24,761 --> 00:35:26,761
Big Chief, you OK?

391
00:35:26,921 --> 00:35:28,681
- Yes, and you?
- Cool.

392
00:35:31,241 --> 00:35:33,961
- Is that a new song?
- Yes.

393
00:35:39,561 --> 00:35:41,321
Is it for Julia?

394
00:35:41,521 --> 00:35:43,641
Sorry, Rudi.
I've got to finish.

395
00:35:52,921 --> 00:35:53,961
Thanks, dude!

396
00:36:10,721 --> 00:36:12,041
Shit, Rudi! Shut it!

397
00:36:12,201 --> 00:36:14,881
Quiet! Good. Come here!

398
00:36:15,681 --> 00:36:17,761
Good dog! Come here!

399
00:36:24,601 --> 00:36:26,241
What's going on inside?

400
00:36:26,401 --> 00:36:28,721
You mean the weight in my heart?

401
00:36:28,881 --> 00:36:30,361
I mean your writing.

402
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:31,721
It's coming on.

403
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:34,441
- Yo, bro.
- Hey, bro!

404
00:36:35,321 --> 00:36:36,361
Have you chosen?

405
00:36:36,521 --> 00:36:38,441
The big one.
We're on tour.

406
00:36:38,601 --> 00:36:41,801
We'll take the finest,
which means...

407
00:36:41,961 --> 00:36:43,161
the most expensive.

408
00:36:43,321 --> 00:36:45,161
The Lamothe Despujols 1989.

409
00:36:45,961 --> 00:36:47,521
We can do even better.

410
00:36:47,681 --> 00:36:51,081
A Pouilly-fuissé
and a carafe of château H2O.

411
00:36:51,241 --> 00:36:53,681
- What?
- Water, I mean.

412
00:36:58,601 --> 00:37:00,801
- The biopsy result?
- Don't worry.

413
00:37:00,961 --> 00:37:03,761
I haven't breathed my last yet.

414
00:37:07,841 --> 00:37:11,201
Milano, Torino, Chiasso, Lugano.

415
00:37:12,361 --> 00:37:13,281
A southern tour.

416
00:37:14,361 --> 00:37:15,561
Rivette's a prat,

417
00:37:15,761 --> 00:37:17,241
but he can hire a bus.

418
00:37:18,961 --> 00:37:20,041
Wow.

419
00:37:22,361 --> 00:37:24,281
- A double decker?
- Yes.

420
00:37:24,481 --> 00:37:26,881
Can you be away that long?

421
00:37:27,041 --> 00:37:28,761
I'll sort it with Sarah.

422
00:37:31,161 --> 00:37:32,681
It'll do you good.

423
00:37:32,841 --> 00:37:34,961
- Are you pleased about it?
- Sure.

424
00:37:35,641 --> 00:37:36,921
Still no news?

425
00:37:37,121 --> 00:37:37,921
No.

426
00:37:38,081 --> 00:37:40,361
It's alright. Stay strong.

427
00:38:41,721 --> 00:38:44,601
- Bravo. It was really good.
- Thanks.

428
00:38:44,761 --> 00:38:48,801
- Has Julia been, by any chance?
- She was here last night.

429
00:38:48,961 --> 00:38:51,441
- "Last night"?
- For the opening night.

430
00:38:51,601 --> 00:38:54,281
Of course.
The opening night.

431
00:38:54,441 --> 00:38:55,561
Yes.

432
00:38:55,721 --> 00:38:57,521
I heard about what happened.

433
00:38:57,681 --> 00:39:01,361
You seem to be
taking it really well.

434
00:39:01,521 --> 00:39:02,801
What do you mean?

435
00:39:02,961 --> 00:39:05,881
We went for a drink
at her boss's place.

436
00:39:06,041 --> 00:39:07,521
She explained a bit.

437
00:39:08,481 --> 00:39:10,241
It's a wonderful flat.

438
00:39:10,801 --> 00:39:13,681
I think she'll be
really happy there.

439
00:39:17,001 --> 00:39:19,441
I want you to meet the actress.

440
00:39:20,521 --> 00:39:22,161
- Eva...
- OK. I'm off...

441
00:40:11,921 --> 00:40:13,361
What a bitch!

442
00:40:14,521 --> 00:40:17,561
She's taking the piss!
With that dickhead!

443
00:40:18,361 --> 00:40:21,441
I'll tell her what I think about it.

444
00:40:21,601 --> 00:40:23,281
You'll do no such thing.

445
00:40:23,441 --> 00:40:25,801
But get the enemy out of the way.

446
00:40:26,001 --> 00:40:28,241
She can sleep with someone else.

447
00:40:28,881 --> 00:40:31,441
But moving in's another matter.

448
00:40:34,761 --> 00:40:35,881
Sleep elsewhere.

449
00:40:36,081 --> 00:40:38,001
Then she can return home.

450
00:40:38,801 --> 00:40:41,521
To have organic orgies
with her green chums.

451
00:40:42,841 --> 00:40:46,121
Run into her,
tell her you've moved out.

452
00:40:46,321 --> 00:40:48,481
Give her back the keys.
Hand over.

453
00:40:51,321 --> 00:40:53,161
Thanks. Good

454
00:40:55,801 --> 00:40:57,081
Like that.

455
00:41:01,721 --> 00:41:02,641
Yeah...

456
00:41:02,801 --> 00:41:06,401
So I've had some time
to consider it.

457
00:41:07,601 --> 00:41:10,721
We needed a break.
You were right.

458
00:41:10,921 --> 00:41:12,041
But...

459
00:41:12,921 --> 00:41:16,681
I think it would be better
if you kept the flat.

460
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:20,961
It was yours in the first place,
all your gear is there, and...

461
00:41:22,841 --> 00:41:23,841
Here.

462
00:41:24,881 --> 00:41:25,921
So...

463
00:41:26,601 --> 00:41:28,081
I found myself a room.

464
00:41:28,761 --> 00:41:29,961
I needed to.

465
00:41:33,161 --> 00:41:36,481
I want you to feel at home,
at home... your home!

466
00:42:03,761 --> 00:42:06,281
- What is it?
- Nothing.

467
00:42:07,761 --> 00:42:08,841
Right...

468
00:42:09,001 --> 00:42:11,881
Whatever you're up to,
it's come in handy.

469
00:42:19,481 --> 00:42:22,081
You're broke.
It's good for everyone.

470
00:42:22,241 --> 00:42:24,881
- Yes. I know, but...
- But what?

471
00:42:25,041 --> 00:42:26,201
What about a hotel?

472
00:42:26,681 --> 00:42:29,521
- No. Too pricey.
- Why is it "too pricey"?

473
00:42:29,681 --> 00:42:33,321
It's too pricey.
And they can cook here.

474
00:42:33,521 --> 00:42:34,961
Yes, alright.

475
00:42:35,121 --> 00:42:37,681
- Alright, what?
- No, nothing.

476
00:43:15,761 --> 00:43:18,041
Since we're taking a break,

477
00:43:18,201 --> 00:43:20,361
let's avoid seeing each other.

478
00:43:20,521 --> 00:43:21,761
Yeah, yeah.

479
00:43:21,921 --> 00:43:24,201
You can tell me, you know.

480
00:43:25,841 --> 00:43:27,361
Call you in 3 weeks.

481
00:43:31,841 --> 00:43:33,641
Thanks, Fernand.

482
00:43:33,801 --> 00:43:35,641
Very smart move
"I've moved out".

483
00:43:35,801 --> 00:43:37,841
She's moved in with that prat,

484
00:43:38,001 --> 00:43:40,721
and I've got Sikhs in the kitchen.

485
00:43:40,881 --> 00:43:41,761
"Sikhs"?

486
00:43:41,921 --> 00:43:43,761
Calm down.
I don't understand.

487
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:47,441
She's rented our flat
to her Madras suppliers.

488
00:43:47,601 --> 00:43:50,561
Shit! Don't panic.

489
00:43:50,721 --> 00:43:52,241
We'll get them out.

490
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:54,241
No, no.

491
00:43:54,401 --> 00:43:56,161
Bet you a case of the best

492
00:43:56,321 --> 00:43:58,721
that she'll call during your break.

493
00:43:58,881 --> 00:44:01,761
Just keep making her miss you,

494
00:44:01,921 --> 00:44:04,841
She'll understand
what's important for you.

495
00:44:06,241 --> 00:44:07,681
I love you too.

496
00:44:56,161 --> 00:44:58,201
- Bobby.
- Kretchmann.

497
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:04,321
- You OK?
- Yes.

498
00:45:05,241 --> 00:45:06,521
You living in there?

499
00:45:08,081 --> 00:45:09,801
Yes. I'll get you a coffee.

500
00:45:12,521 --> 00:45:13,841
Mi casa es tu casa.

501
00:45:14,241 --> 00:45:16,481
Bobby, you're a life-saver.

502
00:45:17,761 --> 00:45:20,001
I've known you since the infants.

503
00:45:22,041 --> 00:45:22,881
You know Luft?

504
00:45:24,921 --> 00:45:26,281
Listen to this.

505
00:45:33,761 --> 00:45:36,281
It's a pity.
You went well together.

506
00:45:36,441 --> 00:45:38,361
You're using the past tense.

507
00:45:38,521 --> 00:45:40,641
I'm only saying it because...

508
00:45:40,801 --> 00:45:44,041
You looked so cool together.

509
00:45:46,081 --> 00:45:47,881
- Are you sulking?
- No.

510
00:45:49,281 --> 00:45:51,441
Don't wait around forever.

511
00:45:51,601 --> 00:45:54,041
A break shouldn't last too long.

512
00:45:54,241 --> 00:45:56,521
I don't want to dash your hopes.

513
00:45:57,361 --> 00:45:58,921
No. I've still got some.

514
00:46:00,281 --> 00:46:02,281
Sorry.
Make me a filter.

515
00:46:04,401 --> 00:46:05,361
Here.

516
00:46:07,481 --> 00:46:10,481
It's true.
You know the statistics.

517
00:46:10,681 --> 00:46:12,201
What statistics?

518
00:46:15,281 --> 00:46:16,721
Don't know exactly.

519
00:46:16,881 --> 00:46:18,361
Off the top of my head.

520
00:46:18,521 --> 00:46:21,481
I saw a report about it.
It's not hopeful.

521
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:32,001
I feel bad. I'm going.

522
00:46:32,161 --> 00:46:34,401
- Where to?
- The home. To sleep.

523
00:46:34,561 --> 00:46:38,001
I'm not letting you rot
in that morgue.

524
00:47:30,441 --> 00:47:32,321
Old chat-up lines bore them.

525
00:47:32,481 --> 00:47:34,761
Get straight to the point.

526
00:47:40,921 --> 00:47:42,241
Excuse me.

527
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:45,721
You're pretty. I'm Bobby.
I'd like to make love.

528
00:47:45,881 --> 00:47:47,881
Is that so? That's wonderful.

529
00:47:48,041 --> 00:47:51,521
- Now? Here? On the ground?
- No. It's a bit dirty.

530
00:47:51,681 --> 00:47:53,681
We can go to mine, or yours.

531
00:47:53,841 --> 00:47:56,041
I'm open.
Can I buy you a drink?

532
00:47:56,201 --> 00:47:58,001
Stick it up your arse!

533
00:47:59,761 --> 00:48:02,961
I was direct, frank.
I told the truth.

534
00:48:03,121 --> 00:48:04,601
Unlike sweet talkers

535
00:48:04,801 --> 00:48:06,121
who just talk crap.

536
00:48:28,801 --> 00:48:30,721
She just walked out, eh?

537
00:48:30,881 --> 00:48:32,321
You sure it was her?

538
00:48:33,921 --> 00:48:36,041
- What a shit night!
- Want some?

539
00:48:36,201 --> 00:48:37,641
- What is it?
- MDA.

540
00:48:37,801 --> 00:48:38,961
I'm against drugs.

541
00:48:39,121 --> 00:48:41,761
Sorry.
I'd forgotten: "against drugs".

542
00:48:41,921 --> 00:48:45,161
Drugs aren't a problem.
Addiction is.

543
00:48:47,801 --> 00:48:48,801
Go on.

544
00:50:02,721 --> 00:50:04,961
- I love you.
- I love you too.

545
00:50:05,121 --> 00:50:06,401
Me too.

546
00:50:08,041 --> 00:50:10,281
God, this music's brilliant!

547
00:50:10,441 --> 00:50:12,761
Yeah! Absolutely brilliant.

548
00:50:37,801 --> 00:50:39,201
We've already met.

549
00:50:40,121 --> 00:50:42,201
- What's your name?
- Virginie.

550
00:50:42,361 --> 00:50:45,561
- That's lovely.
- Why?

551
00:50:45,681 --> 00:50:49,201
Virginie, virginity,
virgin forest. All that.

552
00:50:52,441 --> 00:50:53,241
Wow.

553
00:51:35,001 --> 00:51:36,641
Didn't understand it all.

554
00:51:37,601 --> 00:51:39,641
But it sure came from the heart.

555
00:51:42,161 --> 00:51:43,761
It's really good, Sami.

556
00:51:49,801 --> 00:51:52,601
This one will be a hit.
I tell you.

557
00:54:18,001 --> 00:54:20,641
- The new one.
- Don't know the words.

558
00:54:20,801 --> 00:54:24,201
Sing anything you like.
They're Italian.

559
00:54:24,361 --> 00:54:25,521
Come on.

560
00:54:26,241 --> 00:54:27,241
Come on.

561
00:54:44,761 --> 00:54:48,681
For the first time on stage...

562
00:54:52,201 --> 00:54:56,121
Mamma mia! My Italian...
It's embarrassing!

563
00:54:56,681 --> 00:54:58,401
It talks about

564
00:54:58,921 --> 00:55:01,761
how much easier it is
to seduce 50 women

565
00:55:01,921 --> 00:55:05,121
than to seduce
your own woman 50 times.

566
00:55:22,641 --> 00:55:24,001
Hey, Sami...

567
00:57:04,801 --> 00:57:07,041
I don't know why you're with her.

568
00:57:07,201 --> 00:57:10,521
It's great just now.
She's funny, pretty, clever.

569
00:57:10,681 --> 00:57:11,801
She smells nice.

570
00:57:11,961 --> 00:57:14,441
But in 4 years, it'll be over.
A waste.

571
00:57:14,601 --> 00:57:16,801
The statistics are terrifying.

572
00:57:30,681 --> 00:57:31,481
You said?

573
00:57:43,881 --> 00:57:45,801
Alright. It's organised.

574
00:57:50,481 --> 00:57:51,801
Cool it, Sami!

575
00:57:52,401 --> 00:57:54,961
Ritchie Blackmore's got a demo first.

576
00:57:55,121 --> 00:57:55,921
Blackmore?

577
00:57:56,521 --> 00:58:00,041
Ritchie Blackmore
of Deep Motherfucking Purple.

578
00:58:00,841 --> 00:58:02,881
I hope he leaves things intact!

579
00:58:04,241 --> 00:58:06,841
Isn't this a good place to record?

580
00:58:07,521 --> 00:58:09,761
I think the home would be better.

581
00:58:11,601 --> 00:58:14,361
We need that raw sound.
Our music's simple.

582
00:58:14,561 --> 00:58:18,161
It makes no sense to wait
3 months for the studio.

583
00:58:18,321 --> 00:58:21,681
But it'll give me time
to work on the lyrics.

584
00:58:21,841 --> 00:58:24,481
- It's not necessary.
- It is for me.

585
00:58:24,681 --> 00:58:25,521
Not for me.

586
00:58:26,721 --> 00:58:28,081
But it is for me.

587
00:58:28,281 --> 00:58:30,201
I can't wait 3 months.

588
00:58:34,161 --> 00:58:37,361
Cool it guys.
We'll think it over, OK?

589
00:58:38,041 --> 00:58:39,961
We'll lose this energy.

590
00:58:40,121 --> 00:58:41,881
Let's use it while we can.

591
00:58:43,001 --> 00:58:44,681
Excuse me. I need a piss.

592
00:59:02,601 --> 00:59:04,401
A case of Pouilly-fuissé...

593
00:59:05,521 --> 00:59:06,361
Sami?

594
00:59:16,561 --> 00:59:18,281
Organic or not?

595
00:59:22,481 --> 00:59:23,881
It's been faked.

596
00:59:25,361 --> 00:59:27,041
Calm down, Lionel.

597
00:59:28,241 --> 00:59:29,041
I'm calm.

598
00:59:31,721 --> 00:59:35,121
It's not my business,
but if you want my advice,

599
00:59:35,281 --> 00:59:39,321
we should all sit down
and discuss this peacefully.

600
01:00:10,281 --> 01:00:11,801
You were right, Sami.

601
01:00:11,961 --> 01:00:14,001
It's all rotten to the core.

602
01:00:15,561 --> 01:00:17,361
But it's all relative.

603
01:00:18,241 --> 01:00:20,281
A guy on the radio said...

604
01:00:21,201 --> 01:00:22,921
- don't know who -

605
01:00:23,081 --> 01:00:25,801
the anti-globalisation movement
had no...

606
01:00:26,441 --> 01:00:28,601
no... it slips my mind.

607
01:00:28,761 --> 01:00:32,321
That the movement had
had absolutely no effect

608
01:00:32,481 --> 01:00:33,881
on globalisation.

609
01:00:35,081 --> 01:00:38,761
But without it,
the world would be so much worse.

610
01:00:39,881 --> 01:00:43,041
It all seems so pointless sometimes,

611
01:00:44,281 --> 01:00:46,161
but there is a point to it.

612
01:00:51,801 --> 01:00:54,841
You know what I'd really like,
just now?

613
01:01:03,481 --> 01:01:06,481
A bloody Big Mac!

614
01:01:13,281 --> 01:01:14,281
Not all of it!

615
01:01:28,041 --> 01:01:29,121
Right.

616
01:01:29,841 --> 01:01:31,041
I'm going.

617
01:01:43,161 --> 01:01:44,961
Shall I see if he's alright?

618
01:01:45,121 --> 01:01:47,681
No. I'll deal with it on my own.

619
01:01:47,841 --> 01:01:49,881
If there's any problem, call me.

620
01:01:55,521 --> 01:01:56,561
Julia...

621
01:01:57,481 --> 01:01:59,961
Can I take you to a real restaurant?

622
01:02:03,201 --> 01:02:04,361
Will you call?

623
01:02:28,281 --> 01:02:30,121
- Again.
- But I was into it!

624
01:02:30,281 --> 01:02:31,841
- You want her back?
- Yes.

625
01:02:32,001 --> 01:02:32,801
Doesn't show.

626
01:02:33,001 --> 01:02:34,161
Not convinced.

627
01:02:34,321 --> 01:02:36,201
I should've re-written it...

628
01:02:36,361 --> 01:02:39,401
Rubbish!
It's the blue note that counts.

629
01:02:39,601 --> 01:02:42,241
It's when you play without thinking.

630
01:02:42,401 --> 01:02:44,921
You're in harmony
with the universe.

631
01:02:45,721 --> 01:02:47,361
That's what it's all for!

632
01:02:47,481 --> 01:02:50,441
- The rest is crap!
- Alright, I get it.

633
01:02:51,321 --> 01:02:52,201
Go on then.

634
01:02:52,601 --> 01:02:54,641
Start again, give it everything.

635
01:02:54,801 --> 01:02:56,081
OK. Let's do it.

636
01:02:58,201 --> 01:03:00,041
You'll be the death of me.

637
01:03:36,041 --> 01:03:38,761
Jesus would've have
taken you to task.

638
01:03:38,961 --> 01:03:40,601
Screw Jesus!

639
01:03:40,761 --> 01:03:42,481
And albino nurses.

640
01:04:16,361 --> 01:04:18,881
Sorry.
Have you been here long?

641
01:04:19,041 --> 01:04:20,681
No. No problem.

642
01:04:21,281 --> 01:04:24,041
- You OK?
- Yes. I'm alright.

643
01:04:24,681 --> 01:04:25,721
How much?

644
01:04:26,441 --> 01:04:28,841
- What?
- On a scale of 1 to 10.

645
01:04:30,961 --> 01:04:33,081
Will you have an aperitif?

646
01:04:33,241 --> 01:04:35,041
Yes. What she's having.

647
01:04:38,481 --> 01:04:40,001
I've got you a gift.

648
01:04:45,321 --> 01:04:49,281
It's not much,
but I put my heart into it.

649
01:05:07,441 --> 01:05:08,681
Well...

650
01:05:10,121 --> 01:05:12,041
It's odd to see that because...

651
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:15,561
No. You don't have to say anything.

652
01:05:15,761 --> 01:05:17,721
I thought you were with Lionel.

653
01:05:17,921 --> 01:05:19,081
Pardon?

654
01:05:22,201 --> 01:05:23,681
Someone drugged me.

655
01:05:23,841 --> 01:05:26,881
Who drugged you?
Polanski?

656
01:05:29,761 --> 01:05:32,441
We didn't have sex.
I'm 90% certain.

657
01:05:33,921 --> 01:05:35,921
I'll get a test if you like.

658
01:05:38,121 --> 01:05:39,801
I'm giving up the flat.

659
01:05:52,201 --> 01:05:53,201
Cheers.

660
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:02,721
"A young arts post-graduate
photographed her...

661
01:06:03,401 --> 01:06:05,321
"her erotic adventures."

662
01:06:06,401 --> 01:06:09,201
A personal reflection on polyamory.

663
01:06:09,361 --> 01:06:11,441
Bloody idiots.

664
01:06:13,641 --> 01:06:16,121
- What about the cassette?
- What about it?

665
01:06:16,281 --> 01:06:17,441
Has she got it?

666
01:06:19,441 --> 01:06:21,401
It's just sentimental crap.

667
01:06:23,081 --> 01:06:24,521
Statistics show that

668
01:06:24,681 --> 01:06:27,081
77% of couples fail within 10 years.

669
01:06:27,241 --> 01:06:31,081
Running your life by statistics
is a mug's game, my lad.

670
01:06:31,241 --> 01:06:33,281
I'm not your lad, Fernand!

671
01:06:33,841 --> 01:06:37,001
If you knew women,
you wouldn't be here alone.

672
01:06:44,001 --> 01:06:46,921
"In Nan Goldin's footsteps."

673
01:07:23,881 --> 01:07:24,961
Can I help you?

674
01:07:25,161 --> 01:07:27,801
I know the photographer.
She'll pay.

675
01:08:03,921 --> 01:08:05,081
Julia...

676
01:08:07,321 --> 01:08:08,441
I love you.

677
01:08:23,601 --> 01:08:24,761
Julia...

678
01:08:26,681 --> 01:08:27,801
I love you.

679
01:09:24,441 --> 01:09:25,961
I'm here, Fernand.

680
01:09:33,241 --> 01:09:36,281
Do you remember saying,
that I was lucky.

681
01:09:37,081 --> 01:09:39,481
Lucky to have life behind me?

682
01:09:40,681 --> 01:09:43,041
Well, if you want to swap now...

683
01:09:45,961 --> 01:09:47,121
I'll sign up.

684
01:10:17,961 --> 01:10:20,201
It was my grandma's, I kept it on.

685
01:10:20,361 --> 01:10:23,121
- The rent's cheap.
- It's just brilliant.

686
01:10:23,841 --> 01:10:25,361
I love the furnishings.

687
01:10:28,841 --> 01:10:31,001
It's yours if you want it.

688
01:10:33,761 --> 01:10:37,841
I think we could say that
we absolutely love it, eh, Willy?

689
01:10:38,001 --> 01:10:39,881
It's a dream come true.

690
01:10:40,041 --> 01:10:41,441
A real dream.

691
01:10:46,161 --> 01:10:49,081
- Shouldn't we consider it further?
- Pardon?

692
01:10:49,241 --> 01:10:50,681
Think about it a bit?

693
01:10:50,841 --> 01:10:53,601
If you want us to take the furniture

694
01:10:53,761 --> 01:10:55,201
or buy the cooker,

695
01:10:55,881 --> 01:10:57,921
or pay more rent, say the word.

696
01:10:58,121 --> 01:10:59,561
Does noise bother you?

697
01:11:01,721 --> 01:11:03,761
The 4am goods train is no fun.

698
01:11:03,921 --> 01:11:08,241
And the Wednesday morning market
with the Peruvian pan pipes.

699
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:09,480
And Rudi?

700
01:11:09,921 --> 01:11:10,801
Our junkie.

701
01:11:11,001 --> 01:11:13,041
Leaves syringes lying about.

702
01:11:15,241 --> 01:11:16,641
Julia, I love you.

703
01:11:19,081 --> 01:11:22,881
I was so lucky to meet you
in that filling station.

704
01:11:23,081 --> 01:11:24,281
I love you, Julia.

705
01:11:27,921 --> 01:11:29,921
You're my sunshine, my muse.

706
01:11:31,001 --> 01:11:32,601
I don't know what to...

707
01:11:37,521 --> 01:11:39,201
Julia, will you marry me?

708
01:11:40,201 --> 01:11:41,201
Just 3 letters.

709
01:11:41,361 --> 01:11:43,761
Say yes and I'm yours forever.

710
01:12:15,961 --> 01:12:17,761
You gave her the cassette?

711
01:12:19,361 --> 01:12:20,521
Did she like it?

712
01:12:23,401 --> 01:12:26,201
Yes. I gave it to her.

713
01:12:26,921 --> 01:12:29,401
She loved it.
We hugged and she cried.

714
01:12:30,521 --> 01:12:32,121
You know women.

715
01:13:56,361 --> 01:14:00,201
Before the resurrected Christ,
left this world,

716
01:14:00,361 --> 01:14:03,601
he said he would prepare
a place for his disciples

717
01:14:04,601 --> 01:14:07,081
in a world with neither death,

718
01:14:07,241 --> 01:14:10,721
nor pain, nor grief,

719
01:14:10,881 --> 01:14:12,281
nor suffering.

720
01:14:13,801 --> 01:14:17,801
Every time we are confronted
with the loss of a loved one,

721
01:14:17,961 --> 01:14:22,121
we are equally in a state
of pain and interrogation.

722
01:14:23,641 --> 01:14:26,521
Throughout his often difficult life,

723
01:14:26,681 --> 01:14:29,241
Fernand was in search
of recognition,

724
01:14:29,401 --> 01:14:31,241
love and friendship.

725
01:14:32,521 --> 01:14:34,121
It is with this thought

726
01:14:34,281 --> 01:14:37,521
that we leave him
in our Lord's merciful hands.

727
01:14:39,081 --> 01:14:41,241
Now, as requested by Fernand,

728
01:14:41,401 --> 01:14:44,961
who wanted people to remember
the good times shared,

729
01:14:45,841 --> 01:14:48,121
we will celebrate him in music.

730
01:15:45,881 --> 01:15:47,121
Bastard.

731
01:17:53,281 --> 01:17:54,801
Thank you for the song.

732
01:17:55,561 --> 01:17:56,681
You're welcome.

733
01:17:57,641 --> 01:17:59,481
So when's the wedding?

734
01:18:01,281 --> 01:18:03,161
Shall we think it over?

735
01:20:47,761 --> 01:20:50,761
