1
00:01:19,378 --> 00:01:22,547
A gangster, that's what you are!
A gangster!

2
00:01:23,675 --> 00:01:27,174
You think my fear of scandal
will keep you safe?

3
00:01:27,896 --> 00:01:30,971
You think I'll swallow my pride?
Wrong!

4
00:01:31,433 --> 00:01:35,450
You'll return the money you stole
so ignobly!

5
00:01:36,059 --> 00:01:37,911
You can stare!

6
00:01:39,731 --> 00:01:41,691
Do I look like a victim?

7
00:01:42,257 --> 00:01:44,108
I won't be intimidated!

8
00:01:44,317 --> 00:01:48,726
If you don't return my money
in five minutes, I'll call the police!

9
00:01:49,212 --> 00:01:52,334
Gangsters like you must be kept
from doing harm!

10
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,366
You don't frighten me!

11
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,194
No you don't!

12
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,936
What's on your mind?

13
00:02:05,187 --> 00:02:06,222
A pity!

14
00:02:32,243 --> 00:02:33,388
Jérôme ...

15
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:36,464
Tidy up.

16
00:02:36,966 --> 00:02:39,492
- Straight left?
- Right uppercut.

17
00:02:39,853 --> 00:02:41,532
- Counter?
- Check!

18
00:02:41,782 --> 00:02:43,524
Mademoiselle is improving.

19
00:02:44,811 --> 00:02:46,961
Put him in a taxi
and send him home.

20
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:58,578
His umbrella.

21
00:02:59,001 --> 00:02:59,864
Right.

22
00:03:06,494 --> 00:03:07,330
Come on!

23
00:03:17,796 --> 00:03:20,445
Hello? ...
Catherine here.

24
00:03:20,871 --> 00:03:21,875
Any news?

25
00:03:23,566 --> 00:03:25,437
The bachelor flat, yes.
Address?

26
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:27,169
4 rue Lauriston?

27
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:29,892
Third floor right.

28
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:34,059
Wait, let me write it down.

29
00:03:37,964 --> 00:03:40,851
Yes, yes ...
I'm listening.

30
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,625
The man? ...
Yes.

31
00:03:44,501 --> 00:03:45,882
And the woman.

32
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,706
Very good.

33
00:03:48,844 --> 00:03:52,459
Are there servants in the flat?

34
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,304
How many?

35
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:55,855
Two?

36
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,126
Can they be bought?

37
00:03:58,704 --> 00:04:00,436
Together or separately?

38
00:04:01,566 --> 00:04:03,122
How much for the pair?

39
00:04:04,792 --> 00:04:07,352
Oh, that's nothing ...
Naturally.

40
00:04:07,918 --> 00:04:09,109
Thank you.

41
00:04:10,163 --> 00:04:11,118
All done?

42
00:04:11,457 --> 00:04:14,506
Yes, Mademoiselle.
But, if Mademoiselle permits me,

43
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:18,348
the next time a creature like that
shows up, I'll take care of him.

44
00:04:18,486 --> 00:04:19,377
But why?

45
00:04:19,515 --> 00:04:22,126
I won't have Mademoiselle
risk her life unnecessarily.

46
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:24,864
No drama!
First, I'm not risking my life.

47
00:04:25,116 --> 00:04:27,889
Second, I'm old enough to take care
of myself, aren't I?

48
00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:30,061
I won't have you run
unnecessary risks!

49
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:31,478
It pains me!

50
00:04:31,736 --> 00:04:34,925
You may act the grown lady,
but to me you're still a little girl!

51
00:04:35,088 --> 00:04:37,259
There, there, nursie dear!

52
00:04:39,115 --> 00:04:40,659
Don't go soft on me!

53
00:04:41,086 --> 00:04:42,491
Risks are fun!

54
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:46,370
It's fun to be scared!
Speaking of which, tonight --

55
00:04:46,576 --> 00:04:48,974
- Where's the invitation?
- I have it.

56
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,738
What's the old dear's name?

57
00:04:50,877 --> 00:04:54,542
Mme d'Ambroisie
requests the pleasure ...

58
00:04:54,943 --> 00:04:56,839
I've gotten hired as a waiter.

59
00:04:57,126 --> 00:04:58,845
The staff has been informed.

60
00:04:59,485 --> 00:05:01,519
Don't lose sight of me, waiter.

61
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:04,995
- Yes, Mademoiselle.
- And be extremely prudent.

62
00:05:05,134 --> 00:05:06,778
As usual, Mademoiselle.

63
00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:13,254
Does Mademoiselle think that tonight
we'll have a chance to ...

64
00:05:15,162 --> 00:05:16,191
I think so!

65
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:00,741
The young woman
with the emeralds.

66
00:06:00,905 --> 00:06:01,984
Yes, I saw.

67
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:05,711
- Where is she?
- By the table.

68
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:11,338
- Well?
- Very interesting.

69
00:06:13,347 --> 00:06:16,258
- And the man with her?
- I have his details.

70
00:06:17,062 --> 00:06:18,418
Thanks, Jérôme.

71
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,673
- Take care of the rest.
- Of course.

72
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:27,329
Isn't it too risky?

73
00:06:27,475 --> 00:06:30,462
No. And it's worth it!

74
00:06:30,865 --> 00:06:34,542
A kiss -- a caress --
a rare opportunity!

75
00:06:35,091 --> 00:06:37,563
- Are you sure?
- Trust me.

76
00:06:38,555 --> 00:06:40,850
This is the real thing.
Can you hesitate?

77
00:06:41,508 --> 00:06:43,279
- No.
- Well, then!

78
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:44,885
Come!

79
00:07:10,382 --> 00:07:12,892
The lady with the emeralds
is worth a followup.

80
00:07:13,118 --> 00:07:15,152
- Get her address.
- I have it.

81
00:07:15,356 --> 00:07:17,323
17 rue Tristan.

82
00:07:17,486 --> 00:07:18,842
And the man's?

83
00:07:19,175 --> 00:07:21,259
78 rue Bois-le-Vent.

84
00:07:21,535 --> 00:07:23,844
78 rue Bois-le-Vent.
Got it, thanks.

85
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:40,469
- May I see you Thursday, my place?
- I'm married, Jacques!

86
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,671
Thursday is a no-husband day!

87
00:07:42,803 --> 00:07:44,360
You idiot!

88
00:07:46,607 --> 00:07:51,351
But we must -- hello! --
we must love each other, Gisèle.

89
00:07:51,533 --> 00:07:54,608
Love is written in your hand.
Just read between the lines.

90
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:58,163
- And it's in my cards. So ...
- You rush me, Jacques!

91
00:07:58,351 --> 00:08:02,192
Must we wait until you're a widow
and I married to love each other?

92
00:08:02,395 --> 00:08:04,353
You don't love me, Jacques.

93
00:08:04,504 --> 00:08:07,504
I love you and I desire you.
Let's enjoy the coincidence!

94
00:08:07,906 --> 00:08:10,730
Jacques, you're not serious!

95
00:08:11,511 --> 00:08:13,507
Lucky for us.
May heaven hear you!

96
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:19,063
- Are you looking for someone?
- My dear, it's too dreadful!

97
00:08:19,214 --> 00:08:22,654
- All my jewels! Gone!
- It can't be!

98
00:08:22,854 --> 00:08:25,849
At least you're wearing
some of them.

99
00:08:25,982 --> 00:08:27,563
These are false!

100
00:08:27,789 --> 00:08:30,023
I was afraid to wear the real ones.

101
00:08:30,186 --> 00:08:32,596
My husband was right --
I invite such people!

102
00:08:32,736 --> 00:08:35,208
- Oh, my dear Alice --
- No, Catherine ...

103
00:08:35,904 --> 00:08:37,484
Do you suspect anyone?

104
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:41,490
Too many!
I don't know which to choose!

105
00:08:43,311 --> 00:08:44,915
What are you going to do?

106
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:48,304
I'm a woman of action.
I've already done it!

107
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:50,174
Look.

108
00:08:53,237 --> 00:08:54,341
Police!

109
00:08:54,974 --> 00:08:56,907
Hands up!
Nobody leave!

110
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:00,458
- What did he say?
- He said, "Hands up!"

111
00:09:02,618 --> 00:09:04,048
"Nobody leave!"

112
00:09:23,319 --> 00:09:25,188
- So, my place, Thursday?
- No.

113
00:09:25,628 --> 00:09:26,833
- 3:00?
- No.

114
00:09:27,006 --> 00:09:28,337
- 6 rue de l'Evêché?
- No.

115
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,629
- 4th floor?
- No.

116
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,111
- First door left?
- No.

117
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,156
Brrrng!
There you are.

118
00:09:33,922 --> 00:09:34,925
In thought.

119
00:09:35,165 --> 00:09:36,670
I saw it in your eyes.

120
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,768
Right now,
you're at my place.

121
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,241
Your heart and soul
are at my place.

122
00:09:41,391 --> 00:09:43,500
Not your body --
but that's a detail.

123
00:09:43,638 --> 00:09:44,994
- Hands up!
- Sorry.

124
00:09:45,584 --> 00:09:48,961
Thursday, 3:00, 6 rue de l'Evêché,
5th floor, first door left?

125
00:09:49,186 --> 00:09:50,102
Forward!

126
00:09:50,241 --> 00:09:51,884
You said 4th floor.

127
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,935
You!
Hands up!

128
00:10:03,678 --> 00:10:05,714
What a lovely party.

129
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,885
- Hello, Gisèle.
- Hello, Jacques.

130
00:10:20,135 --> 00:10:22,533
It's 4:00.
You're an hour late.

131
00:10:23,311 --> 00:10:25,457
- What do you mean?
- But you're here!

132
00:10:25,607 --> 00:10:27,327
It's 3:00!

133
00:10:27,579 --> 00:10:30,895
To arrive on time to a lovers' meeting
is to arrive late.

134
00:10:31,122 --> 00:10:32,954
This isn't a lovers' meeting.

135
00:10:33,552 --> 00:10:35,423
It's a friends' meeting.

136
00:10:35,674 --> 00:10:37,858
Then let's make ...
friendship.

137
00:10:39,936 --> 00:10:41,744
What a curious place you have.

138
00:10:42,283 --> 00:10:44,957
Flowers ... ivy ...

139
00:10:45,441 --> 00:10:47,376
cacti ...

140
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:51,742
- A real hothouse!
- You are its rarest, frailest flower!

141
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:56,436
- You live in a garden.
- And you wear one.

142
00:10:56,725 --> 00:11:00,478
Remove that flowerbed
you're using as a hat.

143
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:05,302
I only came to prove I wasn't
afraid of you.

144
00:11:05,439 --> 00:11:07,862
Why do you push me away
if you're not afraid?

145
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,686
I shouldn't have come. ...
What if my husband turned up?

146
00:11:10,849 --> 00:11:13,836
I'd say, "No need to knock --
I detest violence!"

147
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:16,157
I think he followed me.
Let me look --

148
00:11:17,828 --> 00:11:21,832
He has no right to follow you!
The wife must follow her husband.

149
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,236
Are you brave? Courageous?

150
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:27,839
Then don't fear a kiss,
a kiss is not a catastrophe!

151
00:11:28,032 --> 00:11:30,014
The one thing I fear is love.

152
00:11:30,692 --> 00:11:33,266
Poor little thing!
I will protect you from love.

153
00:11:33,441 --> 00:11:37,057
Shelter in my arms.
There, you're safe.

154
00:11:38,463 --> 00:11:41,564
If love tries anything,
it'll have me to answer to.

155
00:11:42,122 --> 00:11:44,230
- Did you hear that?
- Yes, it's 3:30.

156
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,359
- The doorbell!
- Your hearing!

157
00:11:46,522 --> 00:11:49,346
- Listen!
- You're right, it's the doorbell.

158
00:11:49,634 --> 00:11:52,635
- It's my husband, I know his ring.
- But it's my doorbell.

159
00:11:52,943 --> 00:11:56,784
- Where are the back stairs?
- I won't let you sneak out like that!

160
00:11:59,043 --> 00:12:01,491
You'll leave as you came,
by the front door!

161
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,042
The back stairs, or I'll jump
out the window!

162
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:07,407
There are no back stairs,
it's a studio in an old house.

163
00:12:07,552 --> 00:12:09,567
- What can we do?
- Wait.

164
00:12:10,226 --> 00:12:12,485
He'll get tired of ringing
and go away.

165
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,292
Is he playing scales?

166
00:12:16,429 --> 00:12:18,782
- What are you doing?
- Letting Pierre in.

167
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:21,196
- Then I'll hit him.
- Kill my husband?!

168
00:12:21,334 --> 00:12:23,204
I'll just knock him out.

169
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:25,300
While he's KO,
you escape.

170
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:27,923
- Do you know your strength?
- Of course I do!

171
00:12:28,097 --> 00:12:30,418
Draw the curtains
so he doesn't see me.

172
00:12:32,797 --> 00:12:35,112
- Just a second!
- You'll hit my husband!

173
00:12:35,275 --> 00:12:37,403
- I'm a dreadful woman!
- I adore you!

174
00:12:38,802 --> 00:12:40,183
Now, here we go!

175
00:12:43,891 --> 00:12:45,108
Oh, heavens ...

176
00:12:49,447 --> 00:12:51,504
- What?
- It's a woman.

177
00:12:51,643 --> 00:12:53,087
- Who?
- I don't know.

178
00:12:53,224 --> 00:12:55,220
I hope I've not killed her.

179
00:12:55,647 --> 00:12:57,203
No, she's breathing.

180
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,363
- And she's pretty.
- What?

181
00:13:02,878 --> 00:13:05,237
Not as pretty as all that.
Rather ordinary.

182
00:13:07,557 --> 00:13:09,839
The way you open doors ...

183
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:12,124
- Who did you think I was?
- A friend.

184
00:13:13,694 --> 00:13:15,777
Quite a business,
being your friend.

185
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:17,836
He was just playing a joke.

186
00:13:18,238 --> 00:13:20,522
Oh, that was a joke!

187
00:13:20,778 --> 00:13:22,246
Well, aren't you witty!

188
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:24,951
- Oh, well ...
- Almost killingly funny!

189
00:13:28,372 --> 00:13:31,296
Don't worry --
your face isn't marked.

190
00:13:36,863 --> 00:13:39,512
- Lucky you.
- Really? Why?

191
00:13:39,649 --> 00:13:41,708
If you'd put my jaw out --

192
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:43,918
you'd be sorry.

193
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:46,772
You might ask the lady
what she's doing here.

194
00:13:47,388 --> 00:13:48,982
That's so.

195
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:51,241
What are you doing here?

196
00:13:52,045 --> 00:13:55,471
You should thank me.
I am Providence.

197
00:13:57,664 --> 00:13:59,835
I bring you a tranquil tomorrow.

198
00:14:02,483 --> 00:14:03,952
But Madame --

199
00:14:04,994 --> 00:14:07,483
You live in dissipation,
lust, deceit.

200
00:14:07,633 --> 00:14:10,193
Love takes too much time,
desire is quicker.

201
00:14:10,369 --> 00:14:12,704
Your days have only 2 hours,
<i>cinq à sept.</i>

202
00:14:12,842 --> 00:14:14,950
You don't make love,
you kill time.

203
00:14:15,384 --> 00:14:17,493
But what business is that
of yours?

204
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:19,627
Yes, I'd like to know!

205
00:14:19,828 --> 00:14:21,924
Poor little thing!

206
00:14:22,253 --> 00:14:24,099
What are you in this man's life?

207
00:14:24,237 --> 00:14:27,475
Just this moment. Your affair will last
no longer than a rainbow.

208
00:14:27,621 --> 00:14:29,115
Just look at him!

209
00:14:29,337 --> 00:14:31,847
His sly, drooping eyes,
his cynical mouth --

210
00:14:31,985 --> 00:14:35,352
his hands that distribute caresses
like leaflets to every passerby.

211
00:14:35,515 --> 00:14:39,080
He's the very picture of debauchery
and can expect to end in misery --

212
00:14:39,305 --> 00:14:41,653
for who would have pity on him?

213
00:14:41,932 --> 00:14:44,856
That is why I bring him a means
to safeguard his future.

214
00:14:45,361 --> 00:14:48,061
Thanks to this combination clock
and savings bank,

215
00:14:48,343 --> 00:14:51,631
he can advance in perfect security
towards his declining years

216
00:14:51,832 --> 00:14:55,861
by simply inserting a coin or two
in this slot each morning.

217
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,914
This useful and artistic object,
precision engineered,

218
00:14:59,052 --> 00:15:02,818
weighing no more than 750 grams --
I'm not selling it, I'm giving it to him!

219
00:15:02,981 --> 00:15:05,887
For it's a gift to exchange this clock
against -- no!

220
00:15:06,213 --> 00:15:10,054
No, not ten thousand francs, not nine,
not eight -- I'll tell you the sum now,

221
00:15:10,205 --> 00:15:12,828
brace yourselves --
against -- 3,000 francs!

222
00:15:13,003 --> 00:15:15,225
I'm sorry, I don't need a clock.

223
00:15:15,397 --> 00:15:17,405
- You do.
- I don't.

224
00:15:17,568 --> 00:15:20,342
I'll bet you 1,000 francs
you'll buy it for 3,000.

225
00:15:20,518 --> 00:15:21,861
You lose.

226
00:15:22,238 --> 00:15:23,329
Do I?

227
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,092
Then let's talk seriously.

228
00:15:27,238 --> 00:15:29,770
I am in the apartment of
Jacques Tavère?

229
00:15:30,112 --> 00:15:32,028
- Yes.
- Good!

230
00:15:32,982 --> 00:15:35,730
Then give me my 3,000 francs
and we'll say no more.

231
00:15:35,869 --> 00:15:38,392
We've just said
we don't want it.

232
00:15:39,719 --> 00:15:41,740
You are Mme Pierre Morland?

233
00:15:42,819 --> 00:15:44,665
- Yes.
- Of 48 avenue de Saxe?

234
00:15:44,841 --> 00:15:47,702
- Yes.
- The wife of Mr Pierre Morland?

235
00:15:48,116 --> 00:15:50,538
- But --
- If you want

236
00:15:51,516 --> 00:15:55,407
I could also demonstrate my clock to
Mr Pierre Morland, 48 av. de Saxe.

237
00:15:58,181 --> 00:15:59,574
- Blackmail.
- No.

238
00:15:59,772 --> 00:16:01,980
No, no, no,
Targeted marketing.

239
00:16:02,118 --> 00:16:04,215
Oh, yes.

240
00:16:04,428 --> 00:16:07,038
- Madame is a blackmailer.
- A pretty trade!

241
00:16:07,427 --> 00:16:10,301
If you were a man, I'd gladly
break your neck.

242
00:16:10,433 --> 00:16:12,855
You've already tried it.

243
00:16:13,006 --> 00:16:14,701
Well?
My 3,000 francs?

244
00:16:14,851 --> 00:16:17,387
Business must be booming,
at prices like that.

245
00:16:17,537 --> 00:16:20,487
I can't complain.
I have an established clientele.

246
00:16:20,952 --> 00:16:24,680
I even have return customers,
to whom I've sold 20-25 clocks.

247
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:29,236
Of course, establishing contact
is always ... delicate.

248
00:16:29,735 --> 00:16:32,006
But they catch on quickly.

249
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,661
Some even go so far as to ...

250
00:16:38,407 --> 00:16:40,716
pass on their friends' addresses.

251
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:43,767
- That's a little bonus.
- Pay her and make her go!

252
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:46,335
There!
At last a reasonable word!

253
00:16:46,546 --> 00:16:51,042
Here's the order form,
all filled out for you -- just sign!

254
00:16:51,815 --> 00:16:56,045
Add a cheque for 3,000 francs,
and everything will be in order.

255
00:16:59,565 --> 00:17:04,322
You think I'm in cahoots with the lady
and splitting the take with her.

256
00:17:04,686 --> 00:17:06,234
Well, you're wrong!

257
00:17:06,434 --> 00:17:08,706
- Isn't he wrong, Gisèle?
- Are you mad?

258
00:17:08,844 --> 00:17:12,121
I never for a second thought
you could know this adventuress.

259
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:15,325
Thank you, Monsieur.
Better luck in the future.

260
00:17:16,743 --> 00:17:19,366
- Would you open the door for me?
- With pleasure!

261
00:17:19,529 --> 00:17:21,324
- Right, Gisèle?
- Oh, yes!

262
00:17:24,026 --> 00:17:25,632
This time it is my husband!

263
00:17:25,771 --> 00:17:27,465
I'd be delighted to meet him.

264
00:17:27,615 --> 00:17:31,167
- Why must it always be your husband?
- Were you expecting someone else?

265
00:17:32,171 --> 00:17:34,556
- Open, or I'll break down the door!
- Charming!

266
00:17:34,807 --> 00:17:37,963
- Hide, for God's sake!
- Where am I supposed to hide?

267
00:17:38,494 --> 00:17:40,552
You're so disorganized!

268
00:17:54,554 --> 00:17:56,425
- Hello, Pierre!
- Gisèle!

269
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,345
- How are you?
- Gisèle is here!

270
00:17:58,509 --> 00:18:00,429
- You're joking.
- I saw her go in.

271
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,023
That wasn't her!

272
00:18:02,161 --> 00:18:04,043
Then why didn't you open the door
sooner?

273
00:18:04,176 --> 00:18:05,720
I didn't hear you ring.

274
00:18:05,858 --> 00:18:07,703
You didn't -- ?
You're a liar!

275
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:09,887
- Now, Pierre --
- Gisèle!

276
00:18:10,513 --> 00:18:12,321
I tell you, I know she's here!

277
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:15,019
- Pierre, please ...
- Leave me alone! Gisèle!

278
00:18:15,195 --> 00:18:17,605
Good God, Pierre,
calm yourself!

279
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,998
Gisèle is here!

280
00:18:19,845 --> 00:18:20,674
Gisèle!

281
00:18:27,985 --> 00:18:31,311
- Tell me where she is!
- In the name of our friendship --

282
00:18:31,691 --> 00:18:33,347
Don't make a scandal!

283
00:18:33,508 --> 00:18:35,039
She's not on the balcony!

284
00:18:35,177 --> 00:18:36,382
Nor back there!

285
00:18:36,561 --> 00:18:39,460
- Listen, Pierre --
- Let me through!

286
00:18:39,611 --> 00:18:41,719
Wouldn't you rather
have a drink?

287
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:48,401
Pierre, calm down!
I've never seen you like this.

288
00:18:49,023 --> 00:18:51,282
That's the bathroom!

289
00:18:51,509 --> 00:18:52,915
What's going on?

290
00:18:55,145 --> 00:18:57,630
Who is this creature?
Call the police!

291
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,788
Don't, Madame,
I beg of you!

292
00:19:00,956 --> 00:19:02,299
Please forgive me.

293
00:19:03,228 --> 00:19:04,193
I'm a fool.

294
00:19:04,406 --> 00:19:06,377
Better a fool
than a cuckold, no?

295
00:19:06,988 --> 00:19:08,319
I don't understand.

296
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:11,369
I actually believed
that my wife ...

297
00:19:11,531 --> 00:19:13,176
And you were wrong!

298
00:19:13,377 --> 00:19:15,770
And you admit you were wrong,
and off you go.

299
00:19:16,309 --> 00:19:19,447
Put yourself in my place --
appearances were against Gisèle!

300
00:19:19,585 --> 00:19:20,690
For shame!

301
00:19:21,517 --> 00:19:24,166
You deceiver!
Who is this Gisèle?

302
00:19:24,604 --> 00:19:28,006
- My wife.
- As I suspected, alas!

303
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:30,830
Jacques is deceiving me
with your wife!

304
00:19:30,994 --> 00:19:33,014
Not at all!

305
00:19:33,177 --> 00:19:34,822
You're easily convinced!

306
00:19:34,972 --> 00:19:37,683
- I have proof of Gisèle's innocence!
- What proof?

307
00:19:38,249 --> 00:19:40,245
Well ... she's not here!

308
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:44,462
Oh really?
How do you know?

309
00:19:44,613 --> 00:19:46,985
She's here, my poor fellow!

310
00:19:47,135 --> 00:19:49,345
She's here,
she's everywhere in here!

311
00:19:49,478 --> 00:19:53,695
This mirror is Gisèle!
This dreadful clock is Gisèle!

312
00:19:53,834 --> 00:19:56,821
That casually tossed bouquet,
also Gisèle!

313
00:19:56,997 --> 00:19:58,892
Oh, woe is me!

314
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:03,635
Madame, don't make my mistake
of judging too quickly!

315
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:06,723
Again, I beg your pardon.

316
00:20:15,246 --> 00:20:17,568
I've been such a fool ...

317
00:20:18,288 --> 00:20:21,313
But ... she's delightful!

318
00:20:23,321 --> 00:20:24,388
Well ...

319
00:20:27,767 --> 00:20:29,537
And high time too!

320
00:20:29,712 --> 00:20:32,448
- I thought he'd never leave.
- Poor fellow.

321
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:35,197
I don't know how to thank you.
You were wonderful.

322
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,243
Don't thank me.
It wasn't for you.

323
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:39,893
If I lied, it was to spare him
unnecessary pain.

324
00:20:40,089 --> 00:20:41,507
Well, you're amazing.

325
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:44,595
So I've heard.
I've heard it all, in fact.

326
00:20:44,979 --> 00:20:47,553
I hope this experience will be
a lesson to you.

327
00:20:47,828 --> 00:20:50,100
No moralizing, please!

328
00:20:50,521 --> 00:20:54,136
- Feeling more sure of yourself now?
- Was I unsure?

329
00:20:54,618 --> 00:20:57,255
- You were pale as a lily!
- Not at all!

330
00:20:58,485 --> 00:21:01,371
- I was afraid for Gisèle.
- For Gisèle.

331
00:21:01,923 --> 00:21:03,943
Then you'd better reassure her.

332
00:21:04,107 --> 00:21:06,642
My God, I almost forgot! ...
Gisèle!

333
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:09,227
Where are you?

334
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:13,178
Is he gone? ...
Quick, my hat!

335
00:21:13,581 --> 00:21:17,622
- Hurry, get my hat!
- No need to hurry now!

336
00:21:17,778 --> 00:21:20,389
Don't start!
I won't forget today anytime soon!

337
00:21:20,954 --> 00:21:23,163
What have you got
to complain about?

338
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:26,858
- This is all your fault.
- My fault? I'm here by pure chance.

339
00:21:27,273 --> 00:21:29,268
No, you wanted a little adventure.

340
00:21:29,668 --> 00:21:32,115
But not the kind you found.

341
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:35,517
- What do you mean?
- I'm not here to quibble.

342
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:38,552
Stick to your grift
and spare me your lecture.

343
00:21:38,719 --> 00:21:41,292
- You accept only my assistance?
- Now, now ...

344
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:44,380
- Do you defend her?
- No, but she did save us both.

345
00:21:44,543 --> 00:21:47,580
- And you paid her for it!
- He paid for the clock.

346
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:50,314
But not for the little drama
I improvised.

347
00:21:50,591 --> 00:21:53,038
It wasn't worth much --
what are lies to you?

348
00:21:53,234 --> 00:21:56,196
Gisèle, don't scold her
for saving us!

349
00:21:56,359 --> 00:21:58,794
- It's humiliating.
- Oh, is she proud now?

350
00:21:58,953 --> 00:22:01,651
It's humiliating to have
such a credulous husband.

351
00:22:01,789 --> 00:22:03,982
Believing the first idiot
he hears!

352
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:07,358
Little girl,
you're asking for it!

353
00:22:08,488 --> 00:22:10,283
Don't speak to me in that tone.

354
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:12,914
- Your husband may not be fooled.
- How so?

355
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:15,362
You insisted too much
on his going.

356
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:19,084
That would have alerted me --
and I think it did him.

357
00:22:19,235 --> 00:22:22,096
- Don't listen to her.
- Your fate is still in my hands.

358
00:22:22,247 --> 00:22:25,101
Well, I'm going.
Enough of this creature's caprices!

359
00:22:25,255 --> 00:22:27,125
- You shan't leave!
- She shall!

360
00:22:27,552 --> 00:22:30,050
- Am I in the way?
- No, she was stopping you!

361
00:22:30,201 --> 00:22:33,000
- She'll leave when I say so.
- Do you hear that?

362
00:22:33,158 --> 00:22:35,184
Only I can save you --
if I care to!

363
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:37,807
Of course --
you can do anything!

364
00:22:37,978 --> 00:22:40,690
- Time will tell.
- You're a fortuneteller too!

365
00:22:40,912 --> 00:22:42,518
Sometimes, yes.

366
00:22:42,782 --> 00:22:48,329
And right now I foresee
great, great trouble for you.

367
00:22:48,568 --> 00:22:50,516
For one of you,
in particular ...

368
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,611
... who's strolling down there.
Careful!

369
00:22:58,731 --> 00:23:00,412
- He's down there!
- Who?

370
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:01,768
He! ... Yes, he!

371
00:23:01,923 --> 00:23:04,304
- What's he waiting for?
- You to come out.

372
00:23:04,443 --> 00:23:07,267
Apparently my little drama
didn't quite convince him.

373
00:23:07,408 --> 00:23:10,684
What a boor!
I can't bear mistrustful people!

374
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:12,904
He's not going to deny
the obvious!

375
00:23:13,632 --> 00:23:15,478
I'm going to be sick!

376
00:23:15,641 --> 00:23:17,950
Don't make matters worse!

377
00:23:20,094 --> 00:23:22,255
Of course,
you don't have an idea now!

378
00:23:22,982 --> 00:23:24,250
Yes I do.

379
00:23:26,024 --> 00:23:27,732
I have a second clock.

380
00:23:28,184 --> 00:23:30,820
- Are you asking 3,000 francs?
- Not at all.

381
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:34,428
You'll give me them
without my asking.

382
00:23:35,032 --> 00:23:38,710
We're drowning, and you want to haggle
before saving us!

383
00:23:38,953 --> 00:23:41,885
I'm not a philanthropist!
The time I've wasted with you

384
00:23:42,027 --> 00:23:44,813
could have been spent
with another client!

385
00:23:44,951 --> 00:23:46,571
3,000 francs,
that's that.

386
00:23:46,746 --> 00:23:48,415
It's too much!
I won't pay!

387
00:23:48,591 --> 00:23:50,724
As you like!
Farewell!

388
00:23:51,235 --> 00:23:53,758
Give her the 3,000 francs
to get us out of this!

389
00:23:53,908 --> 00:23:56,155
- 3,000 francs?
- My honor is worth that!

390
00:23:56,294 --> 00:23:58,578
- Well, really ...
- Don't haggle!

391
00:23:58,779 --> 00:24:01,113
Very well, 3,000 francs.
What's your idea?

392
00:24:01,761 --> 00:24:02,765
Trust me.

393
00:24:04,212 --> 00:24:06,032
Let's see ... give me a hat.

394
00:24:06,183 --> 00:24:08,279
A hat, a hat ...
here you are!

395
00:24:08,417 --> 00:24:10,137
No, no, one of your hats!

396
00:24:11,066 --> 00:24:12,560
My cheque!

397
00:24:19,676 --> 00:24:21,759
Are you crazy?

398
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:24,307
- She's crazy!
- Let me alone!

399
00:24:24,446 --> 00:24:27,019
You paid me,
you're getting your money's worth.

400
00:24:27,153 --> 00:24:30,630
- I'm an honest worker.
- And a pieceworker!

401
00:24:31,145 --> 00:24:33,743
Don't you understand?
I'm making a jealous scene.

402
00:24:33,956 --> 00:24:35,225
Yes, and so?

403
00:24:35,414 --> 00:24:38,881
And so, you ask your friend
to bring these items up.

404
00:24:39,242 --> 00:24:43,397
Madame will hide behind the door,
and, as soon as your friend enters,

405
00:24:43,636 --> 00:24:47,283
- Madame will slip away.
- Brilliant! Go, go now.

406
00:24:47,525 --> 00:24:50,499
- And I won't charge you extra.
- For throwing out my hat?

407
00:24:50,638 --> 00:24:53,199
Passing as your mistress --
it's compromising!

408
00:24:53,462 --> 00:24:56,914
But you do owe me 3,000 francs
for my story -- agreed?

409
00:24:57,063 --> 00:25:00,942
- Yes or no?
- Oh, all right, yes.

410
00:25:01,419 --> 00:25:03,791
No, no!
That's Papa!

411
00:25:04,067 --> 00:25:06,707
- Right -- sorry.
- No, that's Maman!

412
00:25:07,296 --> 00:25:09,066
Very likely.

413
00:25:09,329 --> 00:25:10,660
Ah, Marguerite ...

414
00:25:14,473 --> 00:25:16,794
Pierre! Pierre!

415
00:25:17,309 --> 00:25:19,029
Bring my things up!

416
00:25:19,806 --> 00:25:20,730
Hurry!

417
00:25:22,977 --> 00:25:24,406
I'll explain!

418
00:25:26,612 --> 00:25:28,772
Now, no mistakes!
Here's the situation:

419
00:25:28,909 --> 00:25:31,269
I'm your jealous mistress,
in a rage.

420
00:25:31,445 --> 00:25:34,390
Making a horrible scene,
storm, cyclone --

421
00:25:34,528 --> 00:25:37,101
That's it!
Now let's get set.

422
00:25:37,761 --> 00:25:40,171
Easy, easy!

423
00:25:40,306 --> 00:25:42,539
A cyclone,
but an apartment cyclone!

424
00:25:42,693 --> 00:25:44,688
Passion
on the installment plan!

425
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:47,984
Bourgeois!

426
00:25:49,478 --> 00:25:50,909
Bougeois? Me?

427
00:25:54,307 --> 00:25:55,550
My clock!

428
00:26:00,622 --> 00:26:03,332
- Oh, lovely.
- You could do the same.

429
00:26:06,943 --> 00:26:08,975
No, no!
A bit more realism!

430
00:26:11,009 --> 00:26:13,256
- And slap yourself.
- With pleasure!

431
00:26:13,792 --> 00:26:15,650
- I said slap yourself!
- Sorry.

432
00:26:22,726 --> 00:26:25,194
I'll teach you manners,
my girl!

433
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:34,617
- You'll pay for this!
- What?

434
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:41,622
- That was your foot, not your hand!
- Oh, right.

435
00:26:43,826 --> 00:26:45,746
Pull yourself together!
Quickly!

436
00:26:55,151 --> 00:26:58,164
- What happened to you?
- Come in, old boy.

437
00:27:00,216 --> 00:27:02,632
- Look at this mess.
- What was that?

438
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:03,940
A draft.

439
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,177
What a scene we just had!

440
00:27:10,517 --> 00:27:13,328
- You don't hold back, do you?
- Where is she?

441
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:16,938
- Where are you?
- Madame, where are you?

442
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:20,152
- The window!
- I hardly think so.

443
00:27:27,695 --> 00:27:30,732
Up there! What's she doing?
Come on!

444
00:27:43,813 --> 00:27:46,285
- Madame ...
- Now, darling ...

445
00:27:46,424 --> 00:27:47,691
Don't touch me!

446
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,922
- My love ...
- She said don't touch!

447
00:27:50,065 --> 00:27:51,847
- Ouch!
- Poor little thing ...

448
00:27:51,997 --> 00:27:54,056
Poor little thing?
Talk to her!

449
00:27:54,232 --> 00:27:56,177
Please get up, Madame.

450
00:27:57,201 --> 00:27:59,259
Help me ...
not you!

451
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:03,427
Calm yourself, Madame ...
listen ...

452
00:28:04,053 --> 00:28:07,362
Don't be upset ...
what are you looking for?

453
00:28:07,555 --> 00:28:08,810
A hankie ...

454
00:28:08,948 --> 00:28:12,525
- Do you have a handkerchief?
- Thank you ...

455
00:28:14,468 --> 00:28:17,405
Please calm yourself ...
I swear Jacques is innocent.

456
00:28:17,694 --> 00:28:20,066
He loves you!
He always has!

457
00:28:21,627 --> 00:28:24,790
He's never stopped loving you!
He told me so just yesterday!

458
00:28:25,548 --> 00:28:26,978
- Really?
- Yes!

459
00:28:27,367 --> 00:28:29,438
- He told you so?
- Yes, yes!

460
00:28:30,154 --> 00:28:32,564
- Word of honor?
- Yes, Madame!

461
00:28:33,229 --> 00:28:35,563
- Do you swear it?
- On Jacques's head!

462
00:28:40,549 --> 00:28:44,678
What did he say, just yesterday?
What did he tell you?

463
00:28:45,427 --> 00:28:50,824
He was saying how much he loved you,
that you were his life ...

464
00:28:51,049 --> 00:28:54,413
He's talked of you since ...
well, a very, very long time ago!

465
00:28:55,828 --> 00:28:59,066
What does he call me,
when he talks about me?

466
00:29:00,736 --> 00:29:03,961
Uh ... he would never tell me
your name!

467
00:29:04,116 --> 00:29:06,249
No, never!

468
00:29:06,927 --> 00:29:10,479
I said,
"Her name is my dearest secret."

469
00:29:10,756 --> 00:29:13,831
"If I yielded to your curiosity,
I would lose something."

470
00:29:14,077 --> 00:29:16,336
- You see?
- Exactly.

471
00:29:16,499 --> 00:29:17,830
Ah, no!
No, no, no!

472
00:29:24,873 --> 00:29:27,433
You're being chivalrous!

473
00:29:27,722 --> 00:29:31,513
Yes, chivalrous!
But how can I believe you?

474
00:29:31,827 --> 00:29:34,902
Ah, no! It's over,
it's all over!

475
00:29:35,248 --> 00:29:36,792
I can but die!

476
00:29:38,336 --> 00:29:39,818
Catherine, Catherine ...

477
00:29:39,955 --> 00:29:42,014
Image of Catherine, farewell!

478
00:29:42,776 --> 00:29:45,645
One must always make a rough draft
of one's suicide.

479
00:29:45,796 --> 00:29:47,138
So like her.

480
00:29:47,741 --> 00:29:49,398
Farewell, me!

481
00:29:53,926 --> 00:29:55,821
Gather up my remains,
gentlemen.

482
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:00,003
My mirror!

483
00:30:00,317 --> 00:30:01,484
His mirror!

484
00:30:02,463 --> 00:30:04,119
There's his love!

485
00:30:04,259 --> 00:30:07,605
- You brute!
- You see, I can but die!

486
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:12,630
Don't be rash, Madame!
My revolver!

487
00:30:14,333 --> 00:30:17,006
Farewell, Jacques!
May we meet in heaven!

488
00:30:50,167 --> 00:30:52,213
Hello?
Hello? Hello.

489
00:30:52,577 --> 00:30:53,744
Hello, Jacques?

490
00:30:53,906 --> 00:30:55,378
Yes? Yes, it is.

491
00:30:58,053 --> 00:31:00,312
- Is he still there?
- Yes.

492
00:31:00,814 --> 00:31:02,257
Is he still suspicious?

493
00:31:02,434 --> 00:31:03,877
No, not at all.

494
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:06,124
- No, it's fine.
- What's that?

495
00:31:07,614 --> 00:31:10,163
The line is clear.
Good day, Monsieur.

496
00:31:10,652 --> 00:31:11,845
What's this?

497
00:31:12,459 --> 00:31:15,835
- Why did you hang up so fast?
- What are you imagining now?

498
00:31:16,069 --> 00:31:18,855
- That was a woman!
- It was the phone company.

499
00:31:19,282 --> 00:31:20,525
The phone company!

500
00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:27,053
From now on, I won't trust
anything he says!

501
00:31:27,267 --> 00:31:29,451
Oh no, Madame, you must!

502
00:31:29,777 --> 00:31:32,024
He's an oaf, but ...

503
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:33,725
he loves you deeply!

504
00:31:35,153 --> 00:31:38,202
If you leave him, his life
will be ruined!

505
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:42,131
Alcohol, wicked women --
that's what you'd condemn him to!

506
00:31:42,838 --> 00:31:45,639
You're a good, honest man.
Oh yes, you are!

507
00:31:45,777 --> 00:31:47,396
But he!

508
00:31:49,373 --> 00:31:51,243
Defend yourself, man!

509
00:31:52,139 --> 00:31:54,273
Think of our past, my love!

510
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,604
Think of our first meeting!

511
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:00,960
It was in autumn,
in Versailles.

512
00:32:02,454 --> 00:32:04,186
Twilight ...

513
00:32:04,575 --> 00:32:06,609
Twilight ... was falling.

514
00:32:08,143 --> 00:32:10,804
You wandered alone ... listless ...

515
00:32:11,027 --> 00:32:13,679
through an alley
of russet oaks ...

516
00:32:16,016 --> 00:32:18,224
And our trip to Spain,
remember?

517
00:32:18,412 --> 00:32:22,755
Coming back through Basque Country,
Landes, Touraine ...

518
00:32:23,361 --> 00:32:25,081
And our nights ...

519
00:32:25,545 --> 00:32:28,370
Our nights ... that lasted
until 3:00 in the afternoon.

520
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:34,786
Ah ... you trusted me then.

521
00:32:36,616 --> 00:32:38,424
How well you lie!

522
00:32:38,741 --> 00:32:39,846
My love ...

523
00:32:40,109 --> 00:32:41,690
What more can I say?

524
00:32:41,967 --> 00:32:43,749
- Say you believe me.
- Yes.

525
00:32:44,565 --> 00:32:45,757
Yes, perhaps ...

526
00:32:47,673 --> 00:32:49,983
I want so much to believe you ...

527
00:32:50,396 --> 00:32:53,070
Even if I don't believe you,
I can pretend to.

528
00:32:54,592 --> 00:32:57,263
And by pretending ...

529
00:32:57,668 --> 00:32:59,777
I'll come truly to believe you.

530
00:33:00,426 --> 00:33:02,508
Jacques ...
my little Jacques ...

531
00:33:13,775 --> 00:33:15,758
Ah ... magnificent ...

532
00:33:16,185 --> 00:33:18,871
Ah ... marvelous ...

533
00:33:25,554 --> 00:33:27,838
But ... but ...
where'd he go?

534
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:32,080
Let go of me! He's gone!

535
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:33,326
So soon?

536
00:33:33,715 --> 00:33:35,748
- You think so?
- I do indeed.

537
00:33:36,238 --> 00:33:37,894
You behaved disgracefully.

538
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:43,101
- You took advantage of the situation.
- You didn't seem to mind.

539
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,687
I was acting.

540
00:33:46,152 --> 00:33:49,127
Yes, but you were carried away
by your own performance.

541
00:33:50,657 --> 00:33:55,602
No! Your pasteboard kisses would have
brought me back to reality.

542
00:33:55,803 --> 00:33:58,325
You don't think you're irresistible,
do you?

543
00:33:58,552 --> 00:34:00,284
No more than yourself.

544
00:34:01,244 --> 00:34:03,919
I, at least, kept my head.

545
00:34:05,726 --> 00:34:08,462
I couldn't love a woman
I had paid, Madame.

546
00:34:08,901 --> 00:34:10,571
To me, you're an employee.

547
00:34:10,727 --> 00:34:11,906
A day laborer.

548
00:34:12,446 --> 00:34:14,957
Now your work is over
and you're dismissed.

549
00:34:15,383 --> 00:34:17,316
I'll have no further need of you.

550
00:34:17,454 --> 00:34:19,137
For your sake,
I hope not!

551
00:34:21,996 --> 00:34:25,750
Your second clock will be delivered
tomorrow before noon.

552
00:34:26,758 --> 00:34:28,238
I didn't ask the time!

553
00:34:30,841 --> 00:34:32,486
Gisèle, answer me ...

554
00:34:33,252 --> 00:34:35,963
I insist we invite the lady
to dinner!

555
00:34:36,289 --> 00:34:37,256
Nonsense!

556
00:34:37,733 --> 00:34:38,775
It's not!

557
00:34:38,905 --> 00:34:41,854
I was a fool, the least I can do
is invite her to dinner!

558
00:34:42,005 --> 00:34:43,687
Completely unnecessary.

559
00:34:44,443 --> 00:34:47,079
And don't think of dining
with that adventuress.

560
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:50,150
But she's a perfect lady!

561
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:53,226
I don't want her to think me
a boor.

562
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:57,423
Be a dear and phone Jacques.

563
00:34:59,858 --> 00:35:02,389
I feel a bit better
knowing that when I left

564
00:35:02,568 --> 00:35:06,006
they were reconciling ...
very tenderly, if you know what I mean!

565
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:06,877
What!

566
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:10,027
I left on tiptoe,
so as not to disturb them!

567
00:35:10,726 --> 00:35:12,194
Spare me the details!

568
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:15,307
Oh, but darling --
they love each other!

569
00:35:15,885 --> 00:35:18,358
I think it's sweet.
Don't you?

570
00:35:18,797 --> 00:35:19,864
Of course!

571
00:35:20,278 --> 00:35:23,805
- And it's taken a load off my mind!
- Oh, yes.

572
00:35:25,057 --> 00:35:28,935
- when I think I could have imagined --
- Imagined what?

573
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,487
How stupid jealousy is!

574
00:35:35,429 --> 00:35:37,726
- So, will you call Jacques?
- No!

575
00:35:40,324 --> 00:35:42,145
How stubborn you can be!

576
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:49,057
Hello? Yes?

577
00:35:49,659 --> 00:35:52,797
Oh yes ...
She's fine ...

578
00:35:55,276 --> 00:35:57,585
Dinner?
Dinner with her?

579
00:35:57,912 --> 00:36:01,163
My poor old chap,
we've broken up ...

580
00:36:01,552 --> 00:36:03,209
Yes, it's final.

581
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:07,213
<i>- Suppose I sent her flowers?</i>
- Flowers?

582
00:36:07,529 --> 00:36:11,637
- No, no flowers -- she has hay fever.
<i>- Scentless flowers?</i>

583
00:36:12,049 --> 00:36:16,141
Scentless flowers? Scentless flowers?
Err ...

584
00:36:16,429 --> 00:36:19,442
<i>- Give me her address, for God's sake!</i>
- Your tone ...

585
00:36:22,208 --> 00:36:25,458
Roussel ...
yes, like the song ...

586
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:29,011
50 rue de l'Abbaye.

587
00:36:31,848 --> 00:36:34,440
And I tell you
I will never see her again!

588
00:36:36,325 --> 00:36:40,002
Pierre Morland invites Catherine Roussel
to dine with him at the Pavillon Rose.

589
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:43,053
Get me dossier 412.

590
00:36:44,374 --> 00:36:47,098
- The Tavère-Morland case?
- Yes.

591
00:36:49,219 --> 00:36:52,470
Case report --
take this down --

592
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,445
Outcome excellent --

593
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:57,688
two clocks.

594
00:36:59,394 --> 00:37:00,851
And complete the forms.

595
00:37:03,286 --> 00:37:04,642
Jacques Tavère --

596
00:37:05,038 --> 00:37:06,733
Standard lover.

597
00:37:07,046 --> 00:37:08,728
100% oaf.

598
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:12,331
Distinguishing features:
has no taste.

599
00:37:15,138 --> 00:37:16,467
Pierre Morland.

600
00:37:16,631 --> 00:37:20,522
Jealous husband.
Conformist.

601
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:24,764
Tailor-made clothes.
Ready-made opinions.

602
00:37:27,675 --> 00:37:28,967
Gisèle Morland.

603
00:37:29,356 --> 00:37:31,791
Pretty. Flirtatious.
Unsettled.

604
00:37:32,419 --> 00:37:35,136
Fidelity: short-term,
but could be consolidated.

605
00:37:35,299 --> 00:37:37,131
Conclusion:
to be followed up.

606
00:37:37,269 --> 00:37:40,118
No, case closed!
I hope never to see them again.

607
00:37:42,428 --> 00:37:45,290
I have an excellent lead
for Mademoiselle --

608
00:37:45,641 --> 00:37:47,700
Baron Verdier and Madame --

609
00:37:47,838 --> 00:37:50,097
- No, no, drop it.
- Why?

610
00:37:50,385 --> 00:37:52,996
- That liaison has lasted 10 years.
- So?

611
00:37:53,348 --> 00:37:54,962
It's too late to intervene.

612
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,908
- I thought tonight --
- No!

613
00:37:57,134 --> 00:37:59,192
You don't understand how I work.

614
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:02,292
Do you think I sell my clocks
at gunpoint?

615
00:38:02,468 --> 00:38:05,578
- I never said that!
- But you thought it! Jérôme?

616
00:38:06,319 --> 00:38:08,879
- Mademoiselle?
- How long have you known me?

617
00:38:09,393 --> 00:38:12,607
I've known Mademoiselle
since the day she was born.

618
00:38:12,795 --> 00:38:14,276
Am I a gentleman?

619
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:16,689
- A perfect gentleman.
- But I never --

620
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,438
When I sold my clocks normally,
what happened?

621
00:38:19,603 --> 00:38:23,720
Mademoiselle was shown out,
sometimes rudely, by normal customers.

622
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:28,000
- And since I sell to selected couples?
- Mademoiselle is no longer shown out.

623
00:38:28,278 --> 00:38:30,613
- How many clocks have I sold?
- 404.

624
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:34,830
How many straying wives
have I brought back to the fold?

625
00:38:35,031 --> 00:38:37,378
More than 200 --
10 of them dubious.

626
00:38:37,518 --> 00:38:39,460
Thank you, Jérôme.
Is that clear?

627
00:38:39,597 --> 00:38:41,593
- Yes, Mademoiselle.
- You may go.

628
00:38:41,766 --> 00:38:44,164
Yes, Mademoiselle.
Excuse me.

629
00:38:45,871 --> 00:38:50,415
Bravo! You were magnificent,
as always -- dignity, style ...

630
00:38:50,551 --> 00:38:52,866
- Anything new?
- Not much -- oh, yes!

631
00:38:53,002 --> 00:38:56,403
Last night, at Mme d'Ambroisie's,
I was on the trail -- false --

632
00:38:56,541 --> 00:38:58,738
of the thieves they arrested
in the salon.

633
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:00,226
Not for us.

634
00:39:00,402 --> 00:39:03,439
Now, the girl with the emeralds
and the tall blond man --

635
00:39:03,779 --> 00:39:07,332
Quite far along.
But nothing decisive.

636
00:39:07,494 --> 00:39:09,766
- What are they waiting for?
- To be free.

637
00:39:09,916 --> 00:39:12,339
His wife leaves tomorrow.
He'll dine with the girl.

638
00:39:12,477 --> 00:39:14,096
- Where?
- The Pavillon Rose.

639
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,617
The Pavillon Rose?
Tomorrow?

640
00:39:40,626 --> 00:39:43,588
- My guests aren't here yet?
- Not yet, M. Morland.

641
00:39:54,088 --> 00:39:56,447
All alone?
Where's Gisèle?

642
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,419
Oh ... migraine.

643
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,521
So it'll just be us boys
tonight?

644
00:40:01,723 --> 00:40:03,467
The table's set for three.

645
00:40:03,605 --> 00:40:05,450
And the third place setting?

646
00:40:05,614 --> 00:40:08,123
- Sterling!
- Man? Woman?

647
00:40:08,285 --> 00:40:09,302
Woman.

648
00:40:10,762 --> 00:40:12,720
- Do I know her?
- By heart.

649
00:40:12,883 --> 00:40:14,088
No! Who is it?

650
00:40:15,418 --> 00:40:16,322
Guess.

651
00:40:16,711 --> 00:40:18,980
I'm no good at riddles.
Who is it?

652
00:40:19,602 --> 00:40:21,183
- Catherine.
- Catherine?

653
00:40:21,474 --> 00:40:22,603
Yes, Catherine!

654
00:40:22,766 --> 00:40:25,088
- I don't know her.
- Come, come, old boy!

655
00:40:26,125 --> 00:40:29,339
- What do you mean?
- Don't be a sorehead!

656
00:40:29,502 --> 00:40:31,309
I'm not, I just don't know her.

657
00:40:31,673 --> 00:40:33,833
"I don't know her!"
"I won't know her!"

658
00:40:33,972 --> 00:40:36,696
I've been through the same thing
with Gisèle.

659
00:40:40,133 --> 00:40:41,175
There she is!

660
00:40:44,716 --> 00:40:47,815
No scenes, now!
Sweetness and light ...

661
00:40:48,357 --> 00:40:49,310
Charm!

662
00:40:55,752 --> 00:40:57,501
You invited that ... person?

663
00:40:58,467 --> 00:40:59,923
I invited Catherine!

664
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,843
You must be mad!

665
00:41:02,157 --> 00:41:04,857
Your relationship short-circuited
because of me --

666
00:41:05,107 --> 00:41:06,513
I'm just resetting it!

667
00:41:06,658 --> 00:41:08,880
- Good evening, Pierre!
- Dear lady ...

668
00:41:09,043 --> 00:41:10,286
Good evening, you!

669
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:13,699
Oh, you look dreadful.

670
00:41:13,891 --> 00:41:16,251
Why so cold and formal!

671
00:41:16,452 --> 00:41:18,172
- What?
- Kiss each other!

672
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:20,443
I have no desire to kiss him.

673
00:41:20,615 --> 00:41:24,041
Unbelievable. So my kiss would be
extremely disagreeable to you?

674
00:41:24,192 --> 00:41:26,087
- Extremely.
- In that case --

675
00:41:26,238 --> 00:41:27,594
Good evening, doll!

676
00:41:28,116 --> 00:41:30,074
Good evening,
ignoble individual!

677
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:32,923
- I hated that.
- So did I.

678
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:36,657
Do sit down.
You're sulking at your own hearts.

679
00:41:36,909 --> 00:41:40,160
I chose the menu --
I'm sure you'll like it.

680
00:41:42,552 --> 00:41:45,013
- Let the festivities begin!
- Very well, sir.

681
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:46,795
Don't brood, old boy!

682
00:41:52,809 --> 00:41:55,594
He may seem callous,
but he has a tender heart!

683
00:41:55,733 --> 00:41:58,155
Jacques may be charming
to his friends ...

684
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:01,206
but to a woman --
that's a different story!

685
00:42:02,471 --> 00:42:04,786
Be indulgent --
he loves you!

686
00:42:04,962 --> 00:42:07,798
He can be unbearable --
you've no idea!

687
00:42:07,974 --> 00:42:10,496
- I have my ways.
- Complexes!

688
00:42:10,998 --> 00:42:11,939
Complexes?

689
00:42:12,089 --> 00:42:15,916
He goes to bed with his shoes on
in case there's a fire!

690
00:42:16,286 --> 00:42:18,571
- No!
- Rubbish!

691
00:42:18,734 --> 00:42:21,119
- Do you dare say I'm lying?
- Yes!

692
00:42:21,596 --> 00:42:23,906
- You don't sleep in your shoes?
- No!

693
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:27,147
I had to put a doormat
beside the bed!

694
00:42:27,767 --> 00:42:28,871
Revolting.

695
00:42:29,382 --> 00:42:30,904
Delightful!

696
00:42:31,054 --> 00:42:32,799
And then the clocks!

697
00:42:33,153 --> 00:42:34,619
What about clocks?

698
00:42:34,772 --> 00:42:36,479
He collects clocks!

699
00:42:37,985 --> 00:42:40,621
Not just any clocks --
savings bank clocks!

700
00:42:43,447 --> 00:42:45,392
I've seen them,
they're dreadful!

701
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:48,643
Didn't I see them
at your place?

702
00:42:49,146 --> 00:42:51,431
He forces them on me!

703
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:56,172
He refuses to come over
unless I have them!

704
00:42:56,322 --> 00:42:58,129
I'm a martyr to his whims!

705
00:42:58,832 --> 00:43:01,907
False from beginning to end!
She's completely ...

706
00:43:02,145 --> 00:43:05,497
Now that's ... that's ...
unchivalrous.

707
00:43:05,642 --> 00:43:08,448
I hate clocks!

708
00:43:08,705 --> 00:43:10,537
You hate them, do you?

709
00:43:10,952 --> 00:43:14,002
He bought two, just the day
before yesterday!

710
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:20,998
Two clocks I'll throw out the window
this very night!

711
00:43:21,148 --> 00:43:23,155
You say that because
Pierre is here!

712
00:43:23,419 --> 00:43:26,828
But you know you'll relapse!
You'll buy others --

713
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:29,088
you know you can't
resist temptation!

714
00:43:29,334 --> 00:43:33,413
You'll fall in love with another --
but they're all the same!

715
00:43:33,589 --> 00:43:35,296
- Not pretty?
- No!

716
00:43:35,619 --> 00:43:37,539
Very pretty,
in my opinion.

717
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:40,425
- Especially the last one!
- From two days ago? Yes.

718
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:43,036
That one you won't have!
No, you won't!

719
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:46,124
I'll see to that --
or it'll cost you!

720
00:43:46,263 --> 00:43:48,823
- If I want it, I'll have it!
- Oh no you won't!

721
00:43:49,856 --> 00:43:54,010
He's obsessed!
I have to keep an eye on him.

722
00:43:54,145 --> 00:43:55,136
On yourself!

723
00:43:55,348 --> 00:43:57,293
Do you know the game
Madame plays?

724
00:43:57,431 --> 00:43:58,994
Cheque-hunting, old boy!

725
00:44:00,544 --> 00:44:02,904
She comes home at night
loaded with cheques!

726
00:44:03,823 --> 00:44:05,454
Cheques all over the floor!

727
00:44:07,625 --> 00:44:09,094
Watch yourself!

728
00:44:16,226 --> 00:44:19,665
We're here tonight to toast
your reconciliation!

729
00:44:24,556 --> 00:44:25,736
Oh, headwaiter!

730
00:44:56,343 --> 00:44:57,586
Wine list, please.

731
00:44:58,117 --> 00:45:01,130
- Let's have another bottle.
- That doesn't seem wise.

732
00:45:01,307 --> 00:45:02,336
Good idea.

733
00:45:03,428 --> 00:45:05,311
I'm devilish thirsty.

734
00:45:05,811 --> 00:45:06,765
What's up?

735
00:45:07,394 --> 00:45:09,214
- All set.
- What?

736
00:45:09,427 --> 00:45:11,128
The couple with the emeralds.

737
00:45:11,392 --> 00:45:13,024
Another bottle of the same.

738
00:45:15,241 --> 00:45:17,225
- It's tonight.
- Where?

739
00:45:17,363 --> 00:45:19,546
Her place.
17 rue Tristan.

740
00:45:21,378 --> 00:45:23,148
So I've brought the necessary.

741
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,489
- It's in the cloakroom.
- Thanks.

742
00:45:28,318 --> 00:45:30,590
- Aren't these peaches delicious?
- Yes.

743
00:45:59,835 --> 00:46:02,208
Did you see?
He was scared!

744
00:46:02,421 --> 00:46:05,371
- I scared him!
- You scare everyone.

745
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:06,843
Jacques ...

746
00:46:07,935 --> 00:46:09,227
Jacques Tavère ...

747
00:46:11,857 --> 00:46:15,572
- <i>C'est moi.</i>
- Get up for me and go over there.

748
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:17,302
- For you?
- Yes.

749
00:46:17,457 --> 00:46:20,996
Go soak your head in cold water,
it'll do me good.

750
00:46:37,465 --> 00:46:38,972
Catherine ...

751
00:46:39,687 --> 00:46:40,754
Jacques ...

752
00:46:42,465 --> 00:46:44,360
No! Pierre ...

753
00:46:45,741 --> 00:46:46,883
That's right!

754
00:47:01,228 --> 00:47:02,547
Catherine ...

755
00:47:04,888 --> 00:47:06,306
You appeal to me so ...

756
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:11,110
But I won't speak of it to you,
because Jacques is my best friend.

757
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:15,947
As he is my best friend,
I will respect you, Catherine.

758
00:47:16,549 --> 00:47:18,771
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

759
00:47:20,969 --> 00:47:25,236
But when he comes back,
I'm going to slap him.

760
00:47:26,903 --> 00:47:30,719
Then he won't be my best friend
and I can tell you ...

761
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:33,032
"Catherine, you're beautiful."

762
00:47:51,204 --> 00:47:52,585
All gone!

763
00:47:52,748 --> 00:47:55,296
It's infallible.

764
00:48:22,228 --> 00:48:25,090
- I'll bring your change, Madame.
- Keep it.

765
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:41,864
There he is!

766
00:48:44,042 --> 00:48:46,365
- I'm going to do it!
- Hard!

767
00:49:01,208 --> 00:49:05,099
Listen, Jacques ...
and don't move ...

768
00:49:09,769 --> 00:49:11,677
- Again!
- Oh, no ...

769
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:15,179
Oh, how can I slap
my best friend?

770
00:49:15,430 --> 00:49:18,894
- But he likes it!
- Don't ask the impossible!

771
00:49:19,121 --> 00:49:21,116
- You refuse?
- I refuse.

772
00:49:21,939 --> 00:49:24,412
- I scorn you.
- I don't care.

773
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:28,295
None for me?

774
00:49:38,902 --> 00:49:41,438
I give you 30 seconds
to finish this glass.

775
00:49:46,707 --> 00:49:48,076
Dear old Pierre ...

776
00:50:01,583 --> 00:50:02,700
Off she goes!

777
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:06,045
- Well, she's cross!
- Why?

778
00:50:06,214 --> 00:50:07,865
She didn't get her slap!

779
00:50:16,228 --> 00:50:18,361
That's right,
I owe her a slap ...

780
00:50:18,537 --> 00:50:21,776
- But gently ...
- Gently or not!

781
00:50:23,947 --> 00:50:25,315
What address, Madame?

782
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:29,316
17 rue Tristan.

783
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:38,240
My cloakroom check!
Quick, I'm in a hurry!

784
00:50:55,229 --> 00:50:58,103
- Where is the lady going?
- 17 rue Tristan.

785
00:50:58,291 --> 00:51:00,776
- My car!
- This way, Monsieur.

786
00:51:01,158 --> 00:51:03,683
Did you see this one?
Worth a fortune!

787
00:51:03,944 --> 00:51:05,858
- And how it gleams!
- I saw.

788
00:51:06,009 --> 00:51:08,004
Together with what I
picked up ...

789
00:51:08,531 --> 00:51:11,061
Look --
all we need.

790
00:51:11,438 --> 00:51:13,685
And now let's beat it.

791
00:51:15,123 --> 00:51:17,270
I'll be glad
when we're 24 hours older.

792
00:51:17,421 --> 00:51:19,868
- So you noticed too?
- No, what?

793
00:51:20,018 --> 00:51:22,290
- The woman watching us.
- What woman?

794
00:51:24,278 --> 00:51:27,378
- She watched us constantly.
- Maybe she liked your looks.

795
00:51:27,541 --> 00:51:31,419
I don't think so.
Something else was on her mind.

796
00:51:31,615 --> 00:51:33,623
We've run into her before.

797
00:51:34,175 --> 00:51:36,322
- We have?
- Think back.

798
00:51:36,761 --> 00:51:38,895
- Well?
- Mme d'Ambroisie's.

799
00:51:39,196 --> 00:51:41,827
Where Sambo kissed his way
to a big haul.

800
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:46,346
- You're right!
- You never notice anything.

801
00:51:47,471 --> 00:51:51,608
- Think she's police?
- Or in the same game as us.

802
00:52:09,606 --> 00:52:14,464
Oh, my fur!
I forgot it and he brought it back.

803
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:19,316
Thank you!
You're a good, honest fellow.

804
00:52:19,630 --> 00:52:23,107
I'll give you a discount
on the next clock I sell you!

805
00:52:23,257 --> 00:52:27,060
- Goodbye!
- Not goodbye, I'm coming with you!

806
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:29,696
- Where?
- There, where you're going!

807
00:52:30,035 --> 00:52:32,771
Can't you see
I'm going to work?

808
00:52:33,027 --> 00:52:34,809
I hate women who work.

809
00:52:38,771 --> 00:52:40,717
- What's that?
- I'll see.

810
00:52:52,933 --> 00:52:54,277
Good evening!

811
00:52:55,228 --> 00:52:57,400
Madame! Madame!
What do you want?

812
00:52:57,868 --> 00:53:00,239
- You weren't expecting me, were you?
- No!

813
00:53:00,415 --> 00:53:04,545
Oh, what a lovely, lovely place
you have!

814
00:53:05,067 --> 00:53:07,089
Family portraits, too!

815
00:53:07,891 --> 00:53:10,465
I ask you,
what are you doing here?

816
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:12,912
Offering you a bargain!

817
00:53:13,196 --> 00:53:14,350
What bargain?

818
00:53:14,615 --> 00:53:19,396
I am Providence --
I offer you a peaceful future!

819
00:53:20,881 --> 00:53:24,016
Monsieur, you lead a dreadful life!

820
00:53:24,283 --> 00:53:27,503
Full of dissipation, debauchery,
and lies!

821
00:53:27,691 --> 00:53:29,688
And where is it leading you?

822
00:53:29,913 --> 00:53:33,087
That is why Providence
brings you this ...

823
00:53:33,777 --> 00:53:37,078
this exquisite little clock!

824
00:53:37,519 --> 00:53:40,569
And thanks to this exquisite
little clock

825
00:53:40,707 --> 00:53:44,515
You can advance with confidence

826
00:53:44,652 --> 00:53:47,075
towards your declining years.
All you need --

827
00:54:01,762 --> 00:54:03,633
Pay no attention to that lady!

828
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,104
Come in, Monsieur.

829
00:54:05,344 --> 00:54:07,729
Providence ...
<i>c'est moi!</i>

830
00:54:08,018 --> 00:54:10,208
Why didn't you stay
where I left you?

831
00:54:10,378 --> 00:54:13,942
It takes a better woman than you
to shake me off!

832
00:54:14,879 --> 00:54:17,717
I have something to say too!

833
00:54:17,867 --> 00:54:19,850
No, not you!

834
00:54:20,101 --> 00:54:23,126
Not me?
We'll see about that!

835
00:54:23,417 --> 00:54:28,915
Live! Live in dissipation
and debauchery!

836
00:54:29,091 --> 00:54:32,781
Life is short!
Never mind the clock!

837
00:54:43,513 --> 00:54:44,429
Let go!

838
00:55:00,742 --> 00:55:01,846
Gisèle ...

839
00:55:02,513 --> 00:55:03,843
Ouch.
Catherine ...

840
00:55:04,772 --> 00:55:06,504
- Where am I?
- On the road.

841
00:55:06,637 --> 00:55:08,419
The road to where?

842
00:55:09,122 --> 00:55:11,318
The land of heart's desire.

843
00:55:12,631 --> 00:55:14,250
Hey, hey, hey ...

844
00:55:15,716 --> 00:55:17,210
Who are you, Monsieur?

845
00:55:17,349 --> 00:55:19,068
This is my car, Monsieur!

846
00:55:19,205 --> 00:55:21,351
Give me back my car at once,
Monsieur!

847
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:25,393
Easy on the accelerator!

848
00:55:25,652 --> 00:55:27,498
- He'll wreck it!
- Be quiet!

849
00:55:27,635 --> 00:55:29,531
This is my car.
Get out!

850
00:55:29,694 --> 00:55:31,928
- Shut it, would you?
- Shut what?

851
00:55:32,104 --> 00:55:33,221
Your traps!

852
00:55:33,389 --> 00:55:36,779
Well, I'm going to sleep.
Wake me at the end of the line.

853
00:56:06,881 --> 00:56:09,090
- Where's the bag?
- I don't know!

854
00:56:09,718 --> 00:56:11,826
- Fine mess we're in.
- And those two?

855
00:56:15,626 --> 00:56:17,031
They're out cold.

856
00:56:17,584 --> 00:56:20,056
- Open the door.
- It's stuck!

857
00:56:20,308 --> 00:56:22,040
- Push.
- I'm pushing!

858
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:39,309
- My necklace!
- Why didn't you guard those two?

859
00:56:39,462 --> 00:56:41,390
If you hadn't jerked the wheell!

860
00:56:41,534 --> 00:56:44,031
Only because that broad
threw her bag!

861
00:56:44,358 --> 00:56:46,981
- There's the bag!
- Come on!

862
00:56:49,950 --> 00:56:52,397
Where's the diamond? ...
There it is!

863
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:56,384
Let's beat it!

864
00:57:08,563 --> 00:57:10,735
What are you doing in my shop?

865
00:57:12,122 --> 00:57:14,005
What?
No one there?

866
00:57:20,805 --> 00:57:21,996
What time is it?

867
00:57:22,173 --> 00:57:24,936
- Hey, where are you going?
- I was looking for you!

868
00:57:25,073 --> 00:57:27,734
- We heard a crash.
- You'll see -- it's a disaster!

869
00:57:27,869 --> 00:57:30,769
You were going too fast!
Don't you know the rule?

870
00:57:31,095 --> 00:57:35,112
- 30 km/hour in town!
- I'm not the driver, I own the shop!

871
00:57:35,401 --> 00:57:37,309
How was I supposed to know?

872
00:57:38,476 --> 00:57:40,371
- No driver?
- He took off!

873
00:57:40,606 --> 00:57:43,178
- Who'll pay my damages?
- I'll investigate.

874
00:57:44,095 --> 00:57:45,125
A revolver.

875
00:57:46,593 --> 00:57:47,409
Loaded?

876
00:57:50,968 --> 00:57:52,990
Catherine? Catherine!

877
00:57:57,893 --> 00:58:01,333
- Are you hurt?
- Something's pressing on me ...

878
00:58:01,496 --> 00:58:02,663
Anything broken?

879
00:58:03,855 --> 00:58:05,374
Why is he asking?

880
00:58:08,112 --> 00:58:09,844
If nothing's broken,
get out!

881
00:58:12,027 --> 00:58:14,814
He could address me in another tone,
don't you think?

882
00:58:16,299 --> 00:58:19,098
These must be the jewel thieves
we're looking out for.

883
00:58:19,713 --> 00:58:22,992
Come to the station and explain
why you have a loaded gun

884
00:58:23,168 --> 00:58:27,071
and all these jewels in your car.
Hurry up!

885
00:58:29,023 --> 00:58:31,169
Come here.

886
00:58:34,672 --> 00:58:36,141
Whose car is it?

887
00:58:37,621 --> 00:58:38,877
- Yours?
- His.

888
00:58:39,287 --> 00:58:42,927
I didn't ask you. ...
Speak only when questioned.

889
00:58:43,254 --> 00:58:46,617
I said it was his car, because
two witnesses are better --

890
00:58:46,756 --> 00:58:49,230
You're not a witness,
you're the accused!

891
00:58:49,368 --> 00:58:50,586
Accused?
Of what?

892
00:58:50,724 --> 00:58:52,908
- You'll know later.
- At what o'clock?

893
00:58:54,189 --> 00:58:57,276
- Are you through interrogating me?
- Is that a question?

894
00:58:57,529 --> 00:59:00,729
- Why?
- You said "Speak only when questioned."

895
00:59:00,896 --> 00:59:03,407
So I wanted to know if
you were questioning me

896
00:59:03,545 --> 00:59:06,494
so as not to irritate you,
because you seem dreadfully --

897
00:59:06,746 --> 00:59:08,491
- irritable.
- Silence!

898
00:59:12,899 --> 00:59:14,029
I'll continue.

899
00:59:15,083 --> 00:59:16,928
Whose car is it?

900
00:59:17,895 --> 00:59:19,803
- Mine.
- His.

901
00:59:20,279 --> 00:59:22,388
And who was driving it?

902
00:59:23,378 --> 00:59:24,922
A man and a woman.

903
00:59:25,696 --> 00:59:29,115
- They were both driving?
- No, they were in the front seat.

904
00:59:29,248 --> 00:59:30,730
But who was driving?

905
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:32,461
- The man.
- What man?

906
00:59:32,926 --> 00:59:34,933
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

907
00:59:35,106 --> 00:59:36,211
- No.
- What?

908
00:59:36,357 --> 00:59:40,361
You were in your own car and you didn't
know the man at the wheel?

909
00:59:40,837 --> 00:59:41,729
I didn't.

910
00:59:42,494 --> 00:59:44,289
Then why was he in your car?

911
00:59:44,534 --> 00:59:48,664
I don't know. I found myself in my car
and he was already in it.

912
00:59:49,468 --> 00:59:51,312
- That's very strange.
- It is.

913
00:59:51,715 --> 00:59:53,346
Where had you met him?

914
00:59:55,643 --> 00:59:56,961
At their place.

915
00:59:57,140 --> 01:00:00,232
- At what time?
- Midnight, one in the morning ...

916
01:00:00,408 --> 01:00:01,769
They'd invited you?

917
01:00:01,907 --> 01:00:05,221
No, they weren't expecting me.
I was there to sell them a clock.

918
01:00:05,372 --> 01:00:08,673
- What?
- Clocks are my business.

919
01:00:09,215 --> 01:00:11,086
You sell clocks
at 1:00 a.m.?

920
01:00:11,249 --> 01:00:15,001
- But they aren't ordinary clocks!
- I should say not!

921
01:00:15,149 --> 01:00:16,932
This gentleman accompanied you?

922
01:00:17,108 --> 01:00:20,095
No, he followed me against my will --
right, Jacques?

923
01:00:21,571 --> 01:00:25,211
- Do you two know each other, at least?
- I know him very well.

924
01:00:25,776 --> 01:00:29,792
Yes, she knows me very well.
I hardly know her at all.

925
01:00:30,048 --> 01:00:31,704
Don't get subtle with me.

926
01:00:33,248 --> 01:00:35,997
If you're going to be wiseacres,
I'll lock you up.

927
01:00:36,188 --> 01:00:38,410
- Good idea!
- No it's not!

928
01:01:46,937 --> 01:01:48,130
Send them in.

929
01:01:49,058 --> 01:01:50,288
Send them in.

930
01:01:53,338 --> 01:01:54,932
Come on!
Hurry up!

931
01:02:00,944 --> 01:02:04,574
It's Monsieur Tavère!
What are you doing here?

932
01:02:04,730 --> 01:02:06,489
That's what I'd like to know!

933
01:02:06,537 --> 01:02:09,304
You must be mad --
don't you know Monsieur Tavère?

934
01:02:09,352 --> 01:02:10,295
Tavère? No.

935
01:02:10,458 --> 01:02:12,780
- You don't know our châtelain?
- No, sir.

936
01:02:12,931 --> 01:02:15,645
I don't know the area.
I've just been assigned here.

937
01:02:15,846 --> 01:02:18,870
If I'd known,
I would have treated him differently.

938
01:02:19,071 --> 01:02:21,494
That reminds me of a song ...

939
01:02:21,673 --> 01:02:25,777
- I am overwhelmed with confusion --
- Now, now ...

940
01:02:25,987 --> 01:02:29,348
- A night in lockup!
- An interesting experience.

941
01:02:29,502 --> 01:02:31,937
And we slept very well.
Didn't we, dear lady?

942
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:34,153
Indeed.
You snored wonderfully.

943
01:02:34,442 --> 01:02:35,596
I snored?

944
01:02:35,772 --> 01:02:37,630
It was like being in an airplane.

945
01:02:37,830 --> 01:02:41,446
Then I didn't snore.
At most, I ... vroomed.

946
01:02:41,595 --> 01:02:44,696
- Much more romantic.
- You must be exhausted, dear lady.

947
01:02:44,935 --> 01:02:48,700
What does that matter,
if Monsieur slept well?

948
01:02:49,549 --> 01:02:52,641
- Monsieur, could you release us?
- With pleasure!

949
01:02:52,841 --> 01:02:54,737
- Then I'll go.
- My apologies!

950
01:02:54,950 --> 01:02:56,526
You're too kind.

951
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:59,125
My thanks
for your gracious hospitality.

952
01:02:59,803 --> 01:03:01,636
Catherine! Catherine!

953
01:03:01,795 --> 01:03:04,117
Goodbye!
Vroom without me!

954
01:03:05,128 --> 01:03:08,914
- Goodbye, then.
- M. Tavère, I can't apologize enough.

955
01:03:09,115 --> 01:03:13,391
- I hope you won't hold this against me.
- Not at all! Goodbye.

956
01:03:13,621 --> 01:03:17,562
But I should have been there!
But one can't be everywhere.

957
01:03:17,707 --> 01:03:21,095
- Especially at night!
- How right you are. Goodbye now!

958
01:03:28,867 --> 01:03:30,097
Mademoiselle!

959
01:03:30,323 --> 01:03:32,030
Mademoiselle!

960
01:03:32,275 --> 01:03:35,137
Allow me to introduce myself --
Jacques Tavère.

961
01:03:35,288 --> 01:03:37,616
Tavère, Jacques --
mean anything to you?

962
01:03:37,789 --> 01:03:39,961
- Go to the devil!
- I'm there already.

963
01:03:40,124 --> 01:03:42,602
- Nice weather we're having.
- Leave me alone!

964
01:03:42,650 --> 01:03:45,320
Our little misadventure
hasn't cooled your temper.

965
01:03:45,466 --> 01:03:47,979
- It was all your fault.
- Yours too, a little.

966
01:03:48,129 --> 01:03:52,790
- You tried to stop my clocks.
- Keep out of other people's business!

967
01:03:52,941 --> 01:03:54,924
Just what I was about
to tell you.

968
01:03:55,087 --> 01:03:57,544
What a pity you didn't end up
under the car.

969
01:03:57,686 --> 01:04:00,004
- Thank you -- oaf.
- Not at all -- wench.

970
01:04:00,155 --> 01:04:00,933
Cretin.

971
01:04:01,071 --> 01:04:05,740
- Vermin. - Boor.
- Shrew. - Buffoon. ...

972
01:04:06,337 --> 01:04:09,076
To think you took thieves
for for lovers!

973
01:04:09,225 --> 01:04:11,383
I suppose you never
make mistakes!

974
01:04:11,546 --> 01:04:13,655
Yes -- I thought you
were clever.

975
01:04:14,984 --> 01:04:16,842
If only you hadn't made me drink.

976
01:04:21,527 --> 01:04:24,677
I usually drink water, Monsieur.
And I'm a vegetarian.

977
01:04:24,928 --> 01:04:27,200
That's why you have
such a vile temper.

978
01:04:29,836 --> 01:04:32,450
- Watch yourself!
- You jostled me!

979
01:04:32,651 --> 01:04:33,542
Charming!

980
01:04:36,441 --> 01:04:38,224
I wish you could see yourself!

981
01:04:38,354 --> 01:04:40,475
- It would put a smile on your face.
- No!

982
01:04:40,864 --> 01:04:42,788
It would!
The way you look ...

983
01:04:47,419 --> 01:04:49,013
Oh, I can't go on!

984
01:04:50,130 --> 01:04:51,097
I'm tired!

985
01:04:54,628 --> 01:04:57,716
I need sleep. I'm thirsty.
I'm hungry.

986
01:04:59,786 --> 01:05:00,966
Hot coffee.

987
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:02,966
Milk. Cream.

988
01:05:03,193 --> 01:05:06,605
Butter, honey, jam.
And lovely crusty toast.

989
01:05:06,781 --> 01:05:08,940
All for you at my place
if you behave.

990
01:05:09,079 --> 01:05:11,287
- Is your place far?
- Seven kilometers.

991
01:05:11,488 --> 01:05:14,149
- Seven ... I can't!
- Come on!

992
01:05:17,179 --> 01:05:19,953
- I'll carry you!
- No, don't!

993
01:05:20,274 --> 01:05:24,115
It's incompatible with my dignity.
Think of something else.

994
01:05:24,402 --> 01:05:25,369
But what?

995
01:05:56,679 --> 01:05:58,688
- Where are we?
- To the devil!

996
01:05:59,265 --> 01:06:01,374
You said to go to the devil --
here we are!

997
01:06:02,341 --> 01:06:03,306
Driver!

998
01:06:03,529 --> 01:06:05,700
Driver, to Paris, please!

999
01:06:05,863 --> 01:06:08,160
<i>- An idée fixe, clearly.
- I must go home!</i>

1000
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:11,361
How about a nice hot bath first?

1001
01:06:11,894 --> 01:06:14,405
- Boiling hot?
- Xavier, boiling hot for Madame!

1002
01:06:16,464 --> 01:06:18,007
Boiling hot for Madame.

1003
01:06:18,196 --> 01:06:20,458
Then you'll drive me
to the station?

1004
01:06:20,609 --> 01:06:23,464
Then you'll have that breakfast
we were talking about.

1005
01:06:25,027 --> 01:06:28,843
- No, I'm not hungry any more.
- Driver, you're dismissed.

1006
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:30,996
Your place is charming.

1007
01:06:31,504 --> 01:06:33,298
Oh, it's lovely.

1008
01:06:33,846 --> 01:06:35,767
Much nicer
than being in prison!

1009
01:06:38,616 --> 01:06:41,418
I can just see you vrooming
beneath the trees.

1010
01:07:34,730 --> 01:07:37,603
Xavier, Mlle Catherine
is sleeping.

1011
01:07:37,775 --> 01:07:40,760
- You'll be sure not to wake her.
- Of course, Monsieur.

1012
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:45,212
She needs rest.
Complete rest.

1013
01:07:46,518 --> 01:07:50,308
- Certainly, Monsieur.
- So keep things quiet.

1014
01:07:50,845 --> 01:07:53,230
If she should wake
and ask for anything,

1015
01:07:53,426 --> 01:07:55,710
give her whatever she wants,
immediately.

1016
01:07:56,125 --> 01:07:58,748
- Behave exactly as though ...
- Indeed.

1017
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:02,033
- Monsieur can count on me.
- Thank you. To business!

1018
01:08:03,035 --> 01:08:06,425
If she should wake while I'm out,
don't let her leave, of course.

1019
01:08:06,725 --> 01:08:07,818
Of course.

1020
01:08:10,768 --> 01:08:11,972
Poor young lady.

1021
01:08:12,122 --> 01:08:14,721
She hasn't had a bad time of it,
but ...

1022
01:08:15,510 --> 01:08:18,610
She mustn't be crossed.
She's ...

1023
01:08:19,523 --> 01:08:20,803
Is it that serious?

1024
01:09:16,288 --> 01:09:17,167
Jacques?

1025
01:09:19,527 --> 01:09:20,368
Jacques?

1026
01:09:22,250 --> 01:09:23,104
Jacques?

1027
01:09:28,394 --> 01:09:31,388
Jacques-Jacques-Jacques-
Jacques-Jacques ...

1028
01:09:32,660 --> 01:09:33,601
Jacques ...

1029
01:09:47,860 --> 01:09:48,813
Jacques ...

1030
01:09:55,205 --> 01:09:56,499
Oh, are you there?

1031
01:09:57,126 --> 01:09:58,934
- Is the car ready?
- The car?

1032
01:09:59,183 --> 01:10:00,752
To take me to the station.

1033
01:10:01,066 --> 01:10:02,898
There is no car,
Mademoiselle.

1034
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:05,672
- What time is the train?
- There is no train.

1035
01:10:06,777 --> 01:10:09,521
- Where is the station?
- There is no station.

1036
01:10:10,236 --> 01:10:12,144
- What is there, then?
- Nothing.

1037
01:10:12,666 --> 01:10:15,395
How does one get back to Paris?
Does one telephone?

1038
01:10:15,579 --> 01:10:18,528
That's it. ... One goes ...
by telephone.

1039
01:10:19,620 --> 01:10:22,131
By telephone?
What are you talking about?

1040
01:10:22,282 --> 01:10:25,059
- You. - Me? - Yes. Are you mad?
- Mad? - Yes!

1041
01:10:25,222 --> 01:10:26,615
If Mademoiselle says so.

1042
01:10:26,791 --> 01:10:28,724
If I say so?
What is wrong with you?

1043
01:10:28,862 --> 01:10:30,305
- Who? - You. - Me? - Yes.
- Nothing.

1044
01:10:30,459 --> 01:10:32,731
Go get Mr Jacques,
I need to talk with him.

1045
01:10:32,871 --> 01:10:35,670
- Yes, yes ...
- I said go get him!

1046
01:10:35,820 --> 01:10:37,146
If Mademoiselle will wait here ...

1047
01:10:37,226 --> 01:10:39,436
Yes, but what are you waiting for?

1048
01:10:39,623 --> 01:10:42,083
Go get the master of the house,
I say!

1049
01:10:42,234 --> 01:10:44,029
Mademoiselle must not
get excited.

1050
01:10:44,179 --> 01:10:46,815
You are beginning
to get on my nerves!

1051
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:49,100
And you'll make me miss
my train!

1052
01:10:56,047 --> 01:10:57,754
You clumsy,
you almost --

1053
01:10:58,759 --> 01:11:01,570
Oh, the brutes!
The brutes!

1054
01:11:02,289 --> 01:11:03,921
They would have sprayed me.

1055
01:11:04,109 --> 01:11:05,653
Certainly, Mademoiselle.

1056
01:11:05,878 --> 01:11:06,959
What?

1057
01:11:09,594 --> 01:11:11,389
Can one go through here?

1058
01:11:13,239 --> 01:11:14,971
Well, don't mind me.

1059
01:11:19,546 --> 01:11:20,876
Excuse me.

1060
01:11:21,241 --> 01:11:23,701
It's all right, Mademoiselle!
Don't worry!

1061
01:11:32,237 --> 01:11:35,186
What is all this?

1062
01:11:35,362 --> 01:11:36,755
Is it a joke?

1063
01:11:37,107 --> 01:11:39,993
If that's how Mademoiselle takes it,
so much the better.

1064
01:11:40,275 --> 01:11:43,303
I'm going to speak to the master.
I'll find him myself.

1065
01:11:43,472 --> 01:11:45,744
Enough of this nonsense,
I'm going home.

1066
01:11:45,907 --> 01:11:47,187
- Careful!
- What?

1067
01:11:47,350 --> 01:11:50,375
In her state, Mademoiselle should
try to keep calm.

1068
01:11:50,577 --> 01:11:52,109
In my state?
What state?

1069
01:11:52,265 --> 01:11:55,262
If Mademoiselle would only rest,
she'd be better balanced.

1070
01:11:59,054 --> 01:12:00,886
You think I'm crazy!

1071
01:12:01,062 --> 01:12:03,371
He thinks I'm crazy!
Jacques!

1072
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:09,285
Jacques, I command you to tell him
I'm not crazy!

1073
01:12:09,510 --> 01:12:12,023
We know. Mademoiselle just needs
a little rest.

1074
01:12:12,221 --> 01:12:13,978
Just listen to him!

1075
01:12:14,142 --> 01:12:17,745
- Just stay here, nice and quiet --
- Nice and quiet!

1076
01:12:17,908 --> 01:12:21,523
- I could strangle someone!
- The crisis is upon her!

1077
01:12:21,698 --> 01:12:23,707
No, but it will be!

1078
01:12:23,971 --> 01:12:24,974
Jacques --

1079
01:12:25,127 --> 01:12:26,318
Did you see that?

1080
01:12:26,457 --> 01:12:28,612
Listen to me.
I must get back to Paris.

1081
01:12:29,075 --> 01:12:30,745
Aren't you comfortable here?

1082
01:12:30,921 --> 01:12:33,582
You don't mean to keep me here
by force?

1083
01:12:33,795 --> 01:12:35,364
Think of it as a holiday.

1084
01:12:35,956 --> 01:12:37,738
- I will go.
- Tomorrow.

1085
01:12:37,877 --> 01:12:38,893
Immediately!

1086
01:12:39,169 --> 01:12:41,165
We must call everyone.
Monsieur!

1087
01:12:41,316 --> 01:12:43,412
We'll get reinforcements.
I am ready --

1088
01:12:43,547 --> 01:12:44,525
Oh, really?

1089
01:12:44,751 --> 01:12:46,555
You clearly need rest.

1090
01:12:46,709 --> 01:12:49,948
I will go home!
That's final!

1091
01:12:50,124 --> 01:12:52,885
Don't shout like that --
I'll think Xavier was right.

1092
01:12:53,265 --> 01:12:55,675
Will you give me a car to go home,
yes or no?

1093
01:12:58,327 --> 01:13:01,257
No. You're in such a state
that I must order you to rest.

1094
01:13:01,305 --> 01:13:03,329
- You order me!
- Careful, Monsieur!

1095
01:13:03,518 --> 01:13:05,074
The mad require caution!

1096
01:13:05,237 --> 01:13:08,602
So I'm mad!
I'm mad, am I?

1097
01:13:08,877 --> 01:13:12,233
I'll show you mad!

1098
01:13:27,958 --> 01:13:29,689
I'm mad, mad, mad!

1099
01:13:29,851 --> 01:13:31,471
I never doubted it.

1100
01:13:31,659 --> 01:13:33,065
Sir, the garden hose!

1101
01:13:33,279 --> 01:13:34,735
I will strangle him!

1102
01:13:35,036 --> 01:13:37,748
Help! She's strangling me!
Monsieur!

1103
01:13:39,688 --> 01:13:42,839
Now, now!
Playtime is over!

1104
01:13:45,173 --> 01:13:47,043
Let me go,
you brute!

1105
01:13:49,637 --> 01:13:53,565
Let me go, you oaf!
Bumpkin! Clodhopper!

1106
01:14:00,761 --> 01:14:03,810
What's wrong with you?
Is this how country air affects you?

1107
01:14:03,986 --> 01:14:05,090
Perhaps!

1108
01:14:05,241 --> 01:14:07,903
I'm not crazy!
I must get back to Paris!

1109
01:14:08,065 --> 01:14:09,647
I have clocks to sell!

1110
01:14:09,793 --> 01:14:10,961
How unfortunate.

1111
01:14:11,099 --> 01:14:14,617
I am determined to prevent
your exercising that talent.

1112
01:14:15,002 --> 01:14:18,768
- Impossible.
- I will not let you cause further harm.

1113
01:14:22,169 --> 01:14:24,604
Lovers will be able to love
in peace.

1114
01:14:25,528 --> 01:14:27,397
You're a public danger, Madame.

1115
01:14:27,536 --> 01:14:29,745
You're not going to lock me up
in here?

1116
01:14:29,883 --> 01:14:32,482
A few days of reflection
will do you good.

1117
01:14:32,745 --> 01:14:34,188
You idiot.

1118
01:14:34,943 --> 01:14:37,089
- You can't be serious.
- Back, back!

1119
01:14:37,339 --> 01:14:39,863
You've made my life a misery
since I met you.

1120
01:14:40,038 --> 01:14:43,614
How many others did you afflict
before me? But that's all over!

1121
01:14:43,752 --> 01:14:45,484
I'll avenge them here and now!

1122
01:14:47,254 --> 01:14:49,086
Go ahead --
I don't care.

1123
01:14:52,291 --> 01:14:54,537
Scream away.
This is an upper floor

1124
01:14:54,701 --> 01:14:57,060
and I sleep on the other side
of the house.

1125
01:14:57,236 --> 01:15:00,285
Goodbye
and happy meditation.

1126
01:15:26,911 --> 01:15:29,823
Good afternoon.
I'd like to speak to Mr Tavère.

1127
01:15:29,965 --> 01:15:31,819
Mr Tavère is at his stables.

1128
01:15:31,981 --> 01:15:35,140
Hearthside Alarm Clocks, sir --
awake to music!

1129
01:15:36,245 --> 01:15:37,852
Please give him my card.

1130
01:15:43,849 --> 01:15:45,180
I'm a specialist.

1131
01:15:49,694 --> 01:15:51,932
- And experienced.
- Clearly.

1132
01:16:04,604 --> 01:16:06,084
Monsieur!

1133
01:16:06,624 --> 01:16:07,904
Monsieur!

1134
01:16:08,663 --> 01:16:11,477
Come up! Come up!
I'm on the upper floor!

1135
01:16:11,650 --> 01:16:14,599
Come to the upper floor, I say!

1136
01:16:14,788 --> 01:16:16,975
The door at the end
of the corridor!

1137
01:16:18,468 --> 01:16:22,172
It's locked, but the key
is in the lock!

1138
01:16:29,647 --> 01:16:31,040
Poor fellow.

1139
01:16:31,794 --> 01:16:33,049
Not his lucky day.

1140
01:16:43,534 --> 01:16:45,393
- Pardon me, sir.
- What is it?

1141
01:16:45,441 --> 01:16:46,935
A person to see Monsieur.

1142
01:16:47,271 --> 01:16:48,702
Hearthside Alarm Clocks

1143
01:16:50,661 --> 01:16:53,284
He's selling ...
would you believe it!

1144
01:17:02,546 --> 01:17:03,563
Was that he?

1145
01:17:04,390 --> 01:17:07,077
Pity. I missed the chance
to throw him out.

1146
01:17:07,582 --> 01:17:09,327
Let's see if calm is restored.

1147
01:17:36,676 --> 01:17:38,546
That's the way to tame them!

1148
01:17:44,295 --> 01:17:46,830
No, monsieur, the office
is closed at this hour.

1149
01:17:48,212 --> 01:17:49,229
It's you!

1150
01:17:50,270 --> 01:17:51,412
In that outfit!

1151
01:17:52,673 --> 01:17:56,464
It is I, in this outfit.
If you only knew how I got it!

1152
01:17:56,787 --> 01:17:59,662
I was going mad with anxiety!
I thought you were dead!

1153
01:17:59,812 --> 01:18:02,298
I was looking everywhere!
I called Pierre Morland --

1154
01:18:02,448 --> 01:18:05,109
if not for him, I'd have
called the police and told all!

1155
01:18:05,243 --> 01:18:07,112
- Why not the dog pound?
- Very funny.

1156
01:18:07,250 --> 01:18:09,899
Morland reassured me.
We'd have talked longer,

1157
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:12,520
but he was meeting
that miserable Tavère.

1158
01:18:12,706 --> 01:18:13,473
Why?

1159
01:18:13,611 --> 01:18:16,083
He's having a dinner party
at his country place.

1160
01:18:16,222 --> 01:18:18,543
- He thought he'd see you there.
- Never!

1161
01:18:23,253 --> 01:18:25,437
A dinner party, you say ...

1162
01:18:26,002 --> 01:18:28,625
- at the home of Jacques.
- of Mr Tavère.

1163
01:18:31,230 --> 01:18:33,277
From now on,
I won't leave your side!

1164
01:18:40,725 --> 01:18:42,469
Good evening, Xavier.

1165
01:18:42,645 --> 01:18:44,779
Are we dining outside?

1166
01:18:44,929 --> 01:18:47,189
What an extraordinary idea!

1167
01:18:47,362 --> 01:18:49,534
- I hope you won't catch cold.
- What?

1168
01:18:49,722 --> 01:18:51,416
I hope you won't catch cold!

1169
01:18:58,690 --> 01:19:01,550
- Mr Tavère seems very nervous.
- Doesn't he, Doctor?

1170
01:19:01,750 --> 01:19:04,037
He received us in the strangest manner.

1171
01:19:04,339 --> 01:19:08,041
- Usually so cool and calm, he bolted!
- He seems worn out.

1172
01:19:08,217 --> 01:19:09,949
- Overwork.
- Women.

1173
01:19:10,715 --> 01:19:13,094
- Monsieur is bleeding!
- I forgot to shave!

1174
01:19:13,257 --> 01:19:15,002
You might have reminded me.

1175
01:19:15,169 --> 01:19:17,763
- Such an eventful day ...
- What are we eating?

1176
01:19:18,516 --> 01:19:21,077
- The menu!
- It will be simple, naturally.

1177
01:19:21,211 --> 01:19:23,458
Go on, then, serve!

1178
01:19:26,216 --> 01:19:28,011
- Upstairs?
- Not a peep.

1179
01:19:28,149 --> 01:19:29,994
- She's sleeping?
- Apparently.

1180
01:19:30,145 --> 01:19:32,768
Absolute silence in that part
of the house!

1181
01:19:35,147 --> 01:19:36,938
- You're back!
- Indeed.

1182
01:19:37,101 --> 01:19:38,519
Where did you get to?

1183
01:19:41,577 --> 01:19:44,416
- You've made up with Catherine?
- Absolutely.

1184
01:19:44,614 --> 01:19:46,660
Then why isn't she here?

1185
01:19:46,811 --> 01:19:48,670
She didn't want to come.

1186
01:19:48,820 --> 01:19:50,551
But if you're reconciled --

1187
01:19:50,718 --> 01:19:52,764
She couldn't be here,
if you prefer.

1188
01:19:52,978 --> 01:19:56,405
- You're hiding something.
- Catherine and I adore each other!

1189
01:19:56,605 --> 01:19:59,667
- But this isn't the moment --
- What are you talking about?

1190
01:19:59,870 --> 01:20:02,417
He was telling me that
he adores Catherine.

1191
01:20:03,390 --> 01:20:04,833
But -- shhh!

1192
01:20:07,697 --> 01:20:09,868
Was that you singing?
What was it?

1193
01:20:10,019 --> 01:20:11,940
- Idiot.
- Who's that?

1194
01:20:12,153 --> 01:20:14,449
- What's the matter?
- Just pain.

1195
01:20:15,604 --> 01:20:17,712
Oh, yes.
Because of Catherine.

1196
01:20:20,135 --> 01:20:21,516
Such dramatic sighs!

1197
01:20:26,060 --> 01:20:29,826
When depression persists
and the first symptoms appear --

1198
01:20:29,963 --> 01:20:32,801
- What must be done, Doctor?
- Treatment! Otherwise ...

1199
01:20:33,064 --> 01:20:34,457
- Otherwise?
- Ah!

1200
01:20:35,927 --> 01:20:40,671
Pierre, I'm counting on you to make
this dinner a success.

1201
01:20:40,835 --> 01:20:42,730
- And you too!
- Of course!

1202
01:20:42,893 --> 01:20:44,952
It's a duty dinner.

1203
01:20:45,128 --> 01:20:47,864
The Président is brusque,
but an excellent fellow.

1204
01:20:48,642 --> 01:20:50,626
And he could be very helpful
to me.

1205
01:20:50,811 --> 01:20:53,434
The doctor was telling me
stories of madmen.

1206
01:20:53,572 --> 01:20:57,056
- They can be very amusing.
- Or tragic!

1207
01:20:57,223 --> 01:20:59,654
Why didn't you insist
that Catherine be here?

1208
01:20:59,814 --> 01:21:02,739
- Oh, no!
- But yes!

1209
01:21:02,937 --> 01:21:05,761
She's pretty, sparkling,
intelligent ...

1210
01:21:05,939 --> 01:21:08,537
- Pierre, don't insist!
- Don't.

1211
01:21:08,725 --> 01:21:11,455
That's right, you've never met her!
She's divine.

1212
01:21:11,909 --> 01:21:14,483
She's unique!
That's the woman you should marry!

1213
01:21:15,086 --> 01:21:17,433
She'd be your true love!

1214
01:21:17,577 --> 01:21:20,426
If I were to marry all my true loves,
I'd have a harem.

1215
01:21:26,186 --> 01:21:30,147
- What on earth?
- Shooting pains in my arm.

1216
01:21:30,323 --> 01:21:31,666
And there.

1217
01:21:35,470 --> 01:21:37,866
And my head ...

1218
01:21:38,632 --> 01:21:41,720
One shouldn't give dinners
in a state like that!

1219
01:21:46,911 --> 01:21:49,957
My dear Président,
let's seat ourselves for dinner.

1220
01:22:04,965 --> 01:22:08,041
Why are we being seated
when nothing's ready?

1221
01:22:08,190 --> 01:22:10,212
Strange way to treat guests!

1222
01:22:12,526 --> 01:22:14,295
My apologies ...

1223
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:16,643
it's just that Xavier ...

1224
01:22:19,934 --> 01:22:22,746
- What's wrong with Jacques?
- I wonder!

1225
01:22:22,909 --> 01:22:25,332
Something strange is going on
in this house.

1226
01:22:25,495 --> 01:22:29,309
A year ago, after a period of fatigue,
the wife of one of my friends --

1227
01:22:29,485 --> 01:22:30,978
I beg your pardon?

1228
01:22:31,153 --> 01:22:33,601
- The wife of one of his friends --
- Perhaps.

1229
01:22:33,739 --> 01:22:35,785
The wife of one of his friends!

1230
01:22:35,949 --> 01:22:36,689
No.

1231
01:22:41,413 --> 01:22:44,400
- Catherine!
- But how did you know her name?

1232
01:22:44,563 --> 01:22:47,149
Catherine!
I was sure of it!

1233
01:22:47,288 --> 01:22:50,176
My dear,
how happy Jacques will be!

1234
01:22:51,791 --> 01:22:55,570
- I'm so relieved you're here with me!
- Why?

1235
01:22:56,498 --> 01:22:58,720
- What's going on?
- It's dreadful --

1236
01:22:59,256 --> 01:23:01,415
- What?
- What?

1237
01:23:02,005 --> 01:23:03,637
You mean you don't know?

1238
01:23:03,951 --> 01:23:04,930
No.

1239
01:23:09,065 --> 01:23:09,968
Hello!

1240
01:23:13,451 --> 01:23:14,693
But -- upstairs!

1241
01:23:17,179 --> 01:23:18,447
You see?

1242
01:23:18,873 --> 01:23:20,154
Jacques ...

1243
01:23:20,392 --> 01:23:21,471
is mad!

1244
01:23:25,196 --> 01:23:26,288
I told you so!

1245
01:23:29,752 --> 01:23:30,869
Who are you?

1246
01:23:34,700 --> 01:23:36,896
Hearthside Alarm Clocks.

1247
01:23:39,023 --> 01:23:40,790
You'll help me, won't you?

1248
01:23:40,931 --> 01:23:43,241
The slightest upset
might unhinge him!

1249
01:23:43,378 --> 01:23:44,533
What an evening!

1250
01:23:44,709 --> 01:23:47,985
- How could it happen so suddenly?
- He was always a bit --

1251
01:23:48,218 --> 01:23:50,992
But he's gotten so much worse
over the past few hours!

1252
01:23:51,130 --> 01:23:52,159
Poor Jacques!

1253
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:55,008
We're all on your side!
Right, Gisèle?

1254
01:23:55,159 --> 01:23:58,812
I forgot you haven't met --
Gisèle, this is Jacques' true love!

1255
01:24:01,088 --> 01:24:02,494
Pardon me.

1256
01:24:04,125 --> 01:24:06,560
Poor Jacques!
Isn't it dreadful?

1257
01:24:06,899 --> 01:24:08,481
Enough of this playacting.

1258
01:24:09,247 --> 01:24:12,824
- I've saved your reputation again.
- You won't take Jacques from me.

1259
01:24:13,565 --> 01:24:16,263
- Careful, your husband.
- You don't frighten me.

1260
01:24:19,752 --> 01:24:21,346
Oh, it's dreadful!

1261
01:24:21,936 --> 01:24:26,622
- What's going on now?
- If you only knew what Gi-

1262
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:29,701
Hush, now --
Jacques will recover.

1263
01:24:30,442 --> 01:24:32,588
I'll calm down.

1264
01:24:32,933 --> 01:24:35,581
She's a bit shaken,
but that's understandable.

1265
01:24:38,510 --> 01:24:40,304
Here's our dear Jacques!

1266
01:24:41,584 --> 01:24:43,898
Let's be seated, dear friends!

1267
01:24:46,315 --> 01:24:49,680
My brooch! My brooch!
I've lost my brooch!

1268
01:24:49,938 --> 01:24:52,235
Where?
That wretched woman!

1269
01:24:52,426 --> 01:24:54,092
Please, not a word!

1270
01:24:54,271 --> 01:24:58,030
She was about to tell Pierre
everything.

1271
01:25:00,001 --> 01:25:01,969
Ah, here it is!

1272
01:25:06,544 --> 01:25:08,590
Dinner is served!

1273
01:25:11,418 --> 01:25:14,631
- I hope it wasn't serious.
- I don't think it was.

1274
01:25:15,636 --> 01:25:19,188
Who's that?
Who are you, my good fellow?

1275
01:25:19,527 --> 01:25:22,125
- Jérôme, sir.
- Jérôme?

1276
01:25:23,632 --> 01:25:27,083
- Yes, Jérôme.
- Oh, of course! Good old Jérôme!

1277
01:25:28,251 --> 01:25:30,701
He's been in Jacques' service
since childhood.

1278
01:25:32,057 --> 01:25:34,592
Serve yourselves!
Jacques composed the menu.

1279
01:25:34,731 --> 01:25:38,309
He'd hate your neglecting
his dishes, eh Jacques?

1280
01:25:38,874 --> 01:25:41,698
- He has very distinctive tastes!
- As do you, my love!

1281
01:25:42,125 --> 01:25:45,527
- What do you say to this dish, sweet?
- You tell me, precious!

1282
01:25:46,179 --> 01:25:48,927
But it's your recipe, dearest!

1283
01:25:49,291 --> 01:25:51,199
Oh, well.
Be that as it may.

1284
01:25:51,860 --> 01:25:53,504
It might be good, at that!

1285
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:04,089
Shoestrings.

1286
01:26:12,257 --> 01:26:15,583
The music doesn't bother you,
does it?

1287
01:26:16,010 --> 01:26:18,294
- What music?
- I don't hear anything.

1288
01:26:19,210 --> 01:26:20,566
The orchestra!

1289
01:26:23,830 --> 01:26:25,360
Do you hear music?

1290
01:26:25,524 --> 01:26:28,035
- Yes ... yes, yes, yes!
- Very well, then.

1291
01:26:28,322 --> 01:26:30,606
You're sure it doesn't bother you,
Pierre?

1292
01:26:31,158 --> 01:26:33,204
No, no, it doesn't bother me.

1293
01:26:33,809 --> 01:26:35,968
- Right, Gisèle?
- On the contrary!

1294
01:26:36,219 --> 01:26:37,662
It's a fine orchestra.

1295
01:26:38,253 --> 01:26:40,247
But it tends to play
too loudly.

1296
01:26:41,088 --> 01:26:45,029
Jérôme! ...
Ask them to play more softly.

1297
01:26:45,162 --> 01:26:47,761
Mademoiselle will remember
they don't speak French.

1298
01:26:47,924 --> 01:26:51,300
I forgot! Motion them to stop,
I fear they're upsetting Mr Jacques.

1299
01:26:51,432 --> 01:26:54,431
No, it's delightful!
Don't you love that --

1300
01:26:57,959 --> 01:27:01,335
Ah, that music!
It gives me a wild desire to dance.

1301
01:27:01,725 --> 01:27:03,080
Come, my dear.

1302
01:27:22,942 --> 01:27:24,147
It's a waltz.

1303
01:27:24,700 --> 01:27:27,963
- How long will this nonsense go on?
- You know I'm mad!

1304
01:27:28,156 --> 01:27:29,888
I swear --

1305
01:27:30,051 --> 01:27:32,235
To prevent me from doing
further harm?

1306
01:27:32,386 --> 01:27:33,917
That I'm a public danger?

1307
01:27:34,846 --> 01:27:37,570
That lovers will be able to love
in peace?

1308
01:27:37,963 --> 01:27:40,059
You should be dancing
with Gisèle.

1309
01:27:42,137 --> 01:27:43,994
Sir! Sir!
What are you doing?

1310
01:27:44,169 --> 01:27:45,211
Not that way!

1311
01:27:46,199 --> 01:27:47,818
Stop, stop!

1312
01:27:53,244 --> 01:27:54,562
My dear friend!

1313
01:27:56,007 --> 01:27:57,638
Who is that?

1314
01:27:58,153 --> 01:27:59,345
Those clothes!

1315
01:28:00,249 --> 01:28:01,944
How glad I am to see you!

1316
01:28:02,132 --> 01:28:05,235
To the left, this time,
and on the lawn, please!

1317
01:28:05,386 --> 01:28:06,592
Don't worry!

1318
01:28:06,967 --> 01:28:11,223
What a charming outfit! And unusual!
Isn't he charming, Jacques?

1319
01:28:11,490 --> 01:28:13,410
What a good idea to invite him!

1320
01:28:13,570 --> 01:28:16,611
- Invited?
- This way, please!

1321
01:28:16,861 --> 01:28:19,335
Do sit down --
in the place of honor!

1322
01:28:19,623 --> 01:28:21,481
Not he!
Anything, but not that!

1323
01:28:21,698 --> 01:28:22,853
Get out!

1324
01:28:25,049 --> 01:28:26,844
Jacques!
Your foster brother!

1325
01:28:27,045 --> 01:28:28,024
What!

1326
01:28:28,187 --> 01:28:30,007
- What's going on?
- She's mad.

1327
01:28:30,867 --> 01:28:32,172
She's mad, too!

1328
01:28:32,437 --> 01:28:34,634
I'll come back another time.

1329
01:28:34,801 --> 01:28:37,501
- Get out! Disappear!
- But Jacques!

1330
01:28:37,664 --> 01:28:39,772
Do you think we're in danger?

1331
01:28:40,525 --> 01:28:42,999
- I can't stand it!
- Dear lady ...

1332
01:28:43,172 --> 01:28:46,298
I can't bear this mad existence!

1333
01:28:46,957 --> 01:28:48,665
I give up, Jacques.

1334
01:28:48,828 --> 01:28:50,862
- I refuse to marry you.
- What?

1335
01:28:51,087 --> 01:28:54,727
- What?
- I'm so sorry to hurt you!

1336
01:28:54,962 --> 01:28:59,250
I know you meant to announce
our engagement tonight.

1337
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:01,522
How marvelous!

1338
01:29:01,659 --> 01:29:03,480
This woman will drive me mad!

1339
01:29:03,688 --> 01:29:08,330
No irony, Jacques -- not after
two years trying to cure you!

1340
01:29:08,482 --> 01:29:09,412
Two years?

1341
01:29:09,683 --> 01:29:15,043
Yes, it's true -- two years ago
we decided to marry!

1342
01:29:15,206 --> 01:29:16,122
Could be.

1343
01:29:16,311 --> 01:29:17,592
Not a word is true!

1344
01:29:18,511 --> 01:29:20,507
Not a word ...?
Jacques!

1345
01:29:21,511 --> 01:29:23,369
Don't you remember Versailles?

1346
01:29:24,109 --> 01:29:27,599
Don't you remember the great alley
of russet oaks

1347
01:29:27,861 --> 01:29:31,093
on which twilight was ...
was falling?

1348
01:29:31,834 --> 01:29:33,667
Don't you remember?

1349
01:29:33,829 --> 01:29:36,942
- I remember!
- See, Pierre remembers!

1350
01:29:37,984 --> 01:29:41,107
<i>- I don't blame you for your amnesia.</i>
- That's rather sweet.

1351
01:29:41,604 --> 01:29:45,382
Nothing that happened to us
was really your fault.

1352
01:29:45,859 --> 01:29:48,482
That consoles me.
But you do love me, Jacques!

1353
01:29:48,829 --> 01:29:50,598
You do love me,
I know it!

1354
01:29:50,862 --> 01:29:53,749
But you forget me,
you lose me ...

1355
01:29:53,957 --> 01:29:55,505
And to find me again,

1356
01:29:55,715 --> 01:29:58,300
you look for me
in every other woman.

1357
01:29:58,527 --> 01:30:00,497
Just ask the women here!

1358
01:30:00,723 --> 01:30:02,480
What does she dare insinuate?

1359
01:30:02,636 --> 01:30:07,093
Oh Jacques, you'll never know
how much I've suffered!

1360
01:30:10,368 --> 01:30:13,793
And my suffering?
Does that mean nothing?

1361
01:30:14,366 --> 01:30:17,002
- Your suffering?
- Yes, every time you leave me!

1362
01:30:18,797 --> 01:30:20,416
You're always leaving me!

1363
01:30:20,554 --> 01:30:22,750
Even today,
when I begged you not to!

1364
01:30:24,761 --> 01:30:28,526
After all, I can't lock you up
in your bedroom!

1365
01:30:29,544 --> 01:30:32,895
Then why do you forget everything?
Why, why?

1366
01:30:33,192 --> 01:30:35,350
When we had to sleep on straw?

1367
01:30:35,526 --> 01:30:39,783
When we groped our way
along obscure paths?

1368
01:30:40,059 --> 01:30:42,570
Our journey in that horrid wagon?

1369
01:30:44,114 --> 01:30:47,025
The auto accident we had
together?

1370
01:30:47,364 --> 01:30:49,720
We could have died
that night ...

1371
01:30:50,072 --> 01:30:52,306
never knowing how our love
would end.

1372
01:30:53,410 --> 01:30:56,122
Because it's over, Jacques!
I'm leaving you!

1373
01:30:56,839 --> 01:30:58,245
Too bad for me!

1374
01:30:58,405 --> 01:31:00,944
Too bad for you --
for one day you'll regret

1375
01:31:01,258 --> 01:31:03,793
giving up a love like mine!

1376
01:31:06,153 --> 01:31:10,932
As I may regret not taking a chance
and risking everything!

1377
01:31:23,771 --> 01:31:24,888
Fascinating!

1378
01:31:25,796 --> 01:31:27,842
You know, neither one is crazy.

1379
01:31:28,089 --> 01:31:29,423
They're both crazy.

1380
01:31:31,218 --> 01:31:33,481
My love, if you won't take a chance --

1381
01:31:33,644 --> 01:31:35,276
- What's this?
- My love!

1382
01:31:35,414 --> 01:31:37,548
The farce is over,
the crowd has gone.

1383
01:31:37,689 --> 01:31:39,057
No, they followed me!

1384
01:31:39,208 --> 01:31:41,479
They're all here,
and we're madder than ever!

1385
01:31:41,630 --> 01:31:44,693
My love, if you won't take a chance,
I am resolute!

1386
01:31:45,031 --> 01:31:47,278
I won't let you leave my heart,
my life!

1387
01:31:47,781 --> 01:31:49,251
My estate, my house ...

1388
01:31:49,966 --> 01:31:50,919
My arms ...

1389
01:31:51,899 --> 01:31:52,840
Help me ...

1390
01:31:53,656 --> 01:31:55,200
Help me return to sanity.

1391
01:31:58,908 --> 01:32:01,230
They're mad about each other,
plain as rain!

1392
01:32:01,419 --> 01:32:03,427
- Eh?
- Plain as rain!

1393
01:32:04,293 --> 01:32:05,122
Perhaps.

1394
01:32:05,322 --> 01:32:07,594
Well, let's eat, anyhow!

1395
01:32:11,313 --> 01:32:13,233
It's true ...
they're all there!

1396
01:32:14,502 --> 01:32:16,309
See them peeking out!

1397
01:32:17,908 --> 01:32:20,016
- Catherine ...
- Jacques ...

1398
01:32:21,661 --> 01:32:24,572
So ... I'm no longer
a public danger?

1399
01:32:24,924 --> 01:32:26,883
Oh ... you're my love.

1400
01:32:27,246 --> 01:32:28,393
My angel ...

1401
01:32:28,544 --> 01:32:29,949
a devil of an angel!

1402
01:32:30,698 --> 01:32:33,597
Swear to me,
in our life going forward:

1403
01:32:33,936 --> 01:32:35,518
no more clocks!

1404
01:32:35,668 --> 01:32:37,514
- Not a one!
- You swear?

1405
01:32:37,687 --> 01:32:40,686
I swear.
Time means nothing to us now.

1406
01:32:42,149 --> 01:32:44,271
True.
Let's forget it.

1407
01:32:44,610 --> 01:32:46,354
- For ever.
- For ever.
