Lawrence Stewart Talbot,

with the money on him.

his gold watch and ring

Wolfbane.

Wolfbane?

20
00:04:51,004 --> 00:04:52,938
Yes.

Here, now.
Come up.

37

Come on.
Wake up and get
along with you.

38

You've got a home,
haven't you?

39
00:06:45,618 --> 00:06:48,212

take you to the station?

00:07:17,484 --> 00:07:20,248
How is the patient, Nurse?
He's conscious,
Dr. Mannering.

42
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,118
And talked.
He insists upon
sitting up.

43
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:25,123
Conscious? Talked?

44
00:07:25,191 --> 00:07:27,659
But that's impossible so soon
after a critical operation.

45
00:07:45,712 --> 00:07:47,805
The nurse tells me
you're well enough to talk.

46
00:07:49,516 --> 00:07:51,575
Why, yes.

Lawrence Talbot?

76

Why, of course.
He lived here.

Good. That's all right, then.
We've got him up here
in our hospital.

I didn't open the window.
The patient must've done it himself.

94

But you were in

109
00:15:05,918 --> 00:15:09,251
I tell you, I did it.
I killed someone.

110
00:15:09,322 --> 00:15:11,313
But you couldn't have.

111
00:15:12,491 --> 00:15:14,891
You must've heard
the nurses discussing it.

00:15:14,961 --> 00:15:17,759
Mr. Talbot, you're suffering
from a delusion.

113
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:22,028
It's true someone was killed
last night, but it happened
many streets from here.

114
00:15:22,101 --> 00:15:25,093
Moreover, he was attacked
by some sort of wild animal.

115
00:15:25,171 --> 00:15:29,437
That's just it.
I turn into an animal.

Well, Mr. Talbot.

117
00:15:36,616 --> 00:15:39,141
Decided to remember
your real name?

118
00:15:39,218 --> 00:15:42,949
Mr. Talbot seems to have
heard about the unfortunate
constable last night.

It's disturbing him.
But he doesn't
understand.

That's where I was bitten
by a wolf.

124
00:16:02,341 --> 00:16:05,572
Only it wasn't a real wolf.
It was a man.

125
00:16:05,645 --> 00:16:09,411
A werewolf.
I killed him.

126
00:16:09,482 --> 00:16:12,645
Now I change into a wolf

00:16:16,055 --> 00:16:18,250

Lawrence Talbot died

Four years?

139
00:16:51,324 --> 00:16:53,258
Well, I did...

140
00:16:55,094 --> 00:16:58,689
Ohh.
I can't die.

141
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,058

<i>[Struggling Sounds</i>

150
00:17:42,575 --> 00:17:46,011
You mean to say that Talbot
actually experienced
that murder last night?

151
00:17:46,078 --> 00:17:48,342
I'm afraid so.

152
00:17:48,414 --> 00:17:51,781
People with brain injuries
sometimes develop
supernormal mental powers...

153
00:17:51,851 --> 00:17:54,217
that are
quite extraordinary.

154
00:17:54,286 --> 00:17:56,379
Certainly he got up
and opened the window.

155
00:17:56,455 --> 00:17:59,822
The borderline between delusion
and reality is very narrow.

156
00:17:59,892 --> 00:18:02,793
Sometimes a patient may
unknowingly overstep that line.

157
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:06,724
Then that man's dangerous.
He ought to be behind bars.

158
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,330
He's a lycanthrope.

159

A what?
<i>Lycanthrope.</i>

160
00:18:12,805 --> 00:18:14,898
Oh.
What's that?

161
00:18:14,974 --> 00:18:17,807
A man who imagines himself
to be a wolf.

162
00:18:17,877 --> 00:18:20,573
Oh.

163
00:18:20,646 --> 00:18:23,513
Poor devil.

164
00:18:23,582 --> 00:18:26,483
We should try to do
something to help him.

165
00:18:26,552 --> 00:18:30,545
Well, Doctor, I think
I'll run up to Llanwelly
and find out...

166
00:18:30,623 --> 00:18:33,091
You know, Inspector,
I had the very same idea.

167
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:35,650
To be able to cure this man,
I have to know who he is.

168
00:18:35,728 --> 00:18:38,162
Right.
We'll go up together.

169
00:18:58,384 --> 00:19:00,477
Somebody's broken
into this vault.

170
00:19:00,553 --> 00:19:02,487
How long since you were
here last, Sergeant?

171
00:19:02,555 --> 00:19:05,854
Not for months.
Nobody's died
in Llanwelly lately,

172
00:19:05,925 --> 00:19:08,120
and nobody comes here
if he doesn't have to.

173
00:19:08,194 --> 00:19:10,128
Hmm.

174
00:19:15,568 --> 00:19:17,593
[Creaking]

175
00:19:19,872 --> 00:19:21,806
The door...

176
00:19:23,509 --> 00:19:26,910
What about it?
It's broken from inside.

177
00:19:26,979 --> 00:19:28,913
Here, give me that.

178
00:19:38,991 --> 00:19:41,482
Someone must've taken
the body out of the tomb.

179
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:45,189
That's not
Lawrence Talbot.
Not Talbot?

180
00:19:45,264 --> 00:19:48,665
Do you know
who this is here?
Yes. That's FreddyJolly.

181
00:19:48,734 --> 00:19:51,032
Who's he?
Been up for vagrancy.

182
00:19:51,103 --> 00:19:53,071
Hmm.

183
00:19:54,273 --> 00:19:56,969
What would you say
he died of, Doctor?

184
00:19:57,042 --> 00:20:00,978
Severed jugular.
This man bled to death.

185
00:20:01,046 --> 00:20:03,207
Same as the constable
in Cardiff.

186
00:20:03,282 --> 00:20:06,046
Looks rather like
the bite of an animal.
Aye, that animal.

187
00:20:06,118 --> 00:20:08,211
We remember it well
hereabouts.

188
00:20:08,287 --> 00:20:11,154
And it must've carried away
the corpse of poor Sir Lawrence.

189
00:20:11,223 --> 00:20:13,783
What animal?
Why,
didn't you know, sir?

190
00:20:13,859 --> 00:20:17,022
There was a wild animal
around here a few years ago.

191
00:20:17,096 --> 00:20:21,226
It killed people.
Bit through their throats,
drained their blood.

192
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:24,497
Did they kill it?
SirJohn Talbot
thought he did, sir.

193
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:27,801
He attacked it
in the dark one night,
or so he thought.

194
00:20:27,873 --> 00:20:31,809
But it was his son
he killed.
Poor Mr. Larry.

195
00:20:31,877 --> 00:20:33,970
Where is
SirJohn Talbot now?

196
00:20:34,046 --> 00:20:38,210
Over there, sir.
Died of grief
shortly after.

197
00:20:38,284 --> 00:20:40,650
Let's get out of here.
But the body, sir.

198
00:20:40,719 --> 00:20:43,051
Mustn't touch that.
That's evidence.
Yes, sir.

199
00:20:43,122 --> 00:20:46,057
Sergeant, if it's convenient,
I'd like to see a photograph
of Lawrence Talbot.

200
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:48,286
There's one up
in my office, sir.
Good.

201
00:20:53,232 --> 00:20:55,632
Here's Mr. Larry's
photograph, sir.

202
00:20:58,304 --> 00:21:01,740
Take a look
at this face, Doctor.
Isn't that our man in Cardiff?

203
00:21:01,807 --> 00:21:05,140
Yes. There is a similarity.
But I wouldn't swear
it's the same man.

204
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:07,701
Of course it's not
the same man.

205
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:11,580
If it were,
I'd be off me top.

206
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:14,141
I think the sergeant here
better come back to Cardiff
with us...

207
00:21:14,219 --> 00:21:16,153
and see if he can positively
identify this man.

208
00:21:16,221 --> 00:21:18,485
That's the thing to do.
Do you mind if I
use your telephone?

209
00:21:18,557 --> 00:21:21,993
I'd like to check up
on my patient's condition.
Of course, Doctor. Over there.

210
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:26,264
[Ringing]

211
00:21:28,133 --> 00:21:31,068
Hello? Put me through
to the Queen's Hospital
in Cardiff, please.

212
00:21:31,136 --> 00:21:34,230
I want to talk to
Dr. Gordon.

213
00:21:34,306 --> 00:21:38,470
Have you ever heard of
a Gypsy woman named Maleva?

214
00:21:38,544 --> 00:21:41,012
A Gypsy woman?
A vagrant, eh?

215
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,310
Mm-hmm.
We always
register them.

216
00:21:43,382 --> 00:21:45,850
Hello, Dr. Gordon?
This is Dr. Mannering speaking.

217
00:21:45,918 --> 00:21:48,113
How's Lawrence Talbot
doing?

218
00:21:48,187 --> 00:21:51,281
You know, the head-injury case
that went violent yesterday.

219
00:21:57,229 --> 00:22:00,824
Did you notify the police?

220
00:22:00,899 --> 00:22:03,697
Well, I suppose that's all
we can do at present.

221
00:22:03,769 --> 00:22:06,966
I'll be back tonight, Doctor.
Good-bye.

222
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,166
What happened to Talbot?
Did he die?

223
00:22:09,241 --> 00:22:12,233
No, he tore off
his straightjacket during
the night and escaped.

224
00:22:12,311 --> 00:22:14,711
Tore off
his straightjacket?

225
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:17,146
How?
Bit right through it.

226
00:22:17,216 --> 00:22:19,616
Tore it to shreds
with his teeth.

227
00:22:22,121 --> 00:22:24,055
With his teeth?

228
00:22:37,102 --> 00:22:39,832
[Barking]

229
00:22:39,905 --> 00:22:42,430
Bruno!
Stop it!

230
00:23:02,761 --> 00:23:05,355
What do you want here?

231
00:23:05,431 --> 00:23:08,730
I'm looking for
an old Gypsy woman.

232
00:23:08,801 --> 00:23:10,894
Maleva is her name.

233
00:23:10,969 --> 00:23:13,767
Is she here with you?
Maleva?
Yeah, she is with us.

234
00:23:16,508 --> 00:23:19,841
You'll find her
over there.

235
00:23:26,652 --> 00:23:29,177
Maleva!

236
00:23:29,254 --> 00:23:31,347
They told me
you'd left England.

237
00:23:31,423 --> 00:23:35,587
I've looked all over Europe
for you, from town to town.

238
00:23:35,661 --> 00:23:39,290
Now that I've found you,
you must help me.

239
00:23:41,433 --> 00:23:43,367
Come in.

240
00:23:59,518 --> 00:24:02,419
What do you want
from me?

241
00:24:02,488 --> 00:24:04,683
Maleva,

242
00:24:04,757 --> 00:24:07,749
here I still carry
the sign of the pentagram.

243
00:24:07,826 --> 00:24:10,351
The mark
of the werewolf.

244
00:24:10,429 --> 00:24:13,330
I kill people.

245
00:24:13,398 --> 00:24:16,094
When the moon is full,
I turn into a wolf.

246
00:24:16,168 --> 00:24:19,160
It's not in my power
to help you.

247
00:24:19,238 --> 00:24:21,798
You're the only one
that understands.

248
00:24:21,874 --> 00:24:24,672
Nobody else in the world
will believe me.

249
00:24:29,181 --> 00:24:32,514
But you...
you know.

250
00:24:33,585 --> 00:24:36,679
Your own son Bela
was a werewolf.

251
00:24:36,755 --> 00:24:40,191
He attacked me.
He changed me
into a werewolf.

252
00:24:40,259 --> 00:24:43,422
<i>He's the one that put</i>
<i>this curse on me.</i>

253
00:24:43,495 --> 00:24:47,522
You watched over him until
he was permitted to die.

254
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:50,159
Well, now I want to
die too.

255
00:24:50,235 --> 00:24:53,762
<i>Won't you show me</i>
<i>the way?</i>
I can't.

256
00:24:59,244 --> 00:25:02,680
But I will guard you
and take care of you...

257
00:25:02,748 --> 00:25:05,046
as I took care of
my own son.

258
00:25:05,117 --> 00:25:09,053
You're not leaving us.
You're not going with him.

259
00:25:09,121 --> 00:25:11,214
He has the sign
of the beast on him.

260
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:14,623
He is dangerous
only when the moon is full.

261
00:25:14,693 --> 00:25:16,684
I shall watch over him.

262
00:25:16,762 --> 00:25:19,128
He will murder you.

263
00:25:19,198 --> 00:25:23,259
No. I shall take him
to a place I know.

264
00:25:25,404 --> 00:25:28,100
Where?
I know a man...

265
00:25:28,173 --> 00:25:31,165
who has the power
to help you.

266
00:25:31,243 --> 00:25:33,370
Help me?

267
00:25:33,445 --> 00:25:35,379
Who?

268
00:26:16,889 --> 00:26:18,857
Is that the town?

269
00:26:18,924 --> 00:26:21,722
Yes, that is Vasaria.

270
00:26:23,428 --> 00:26:26,920
At last.
[Clicking Tongue]

271
00:26:42,347 --> 00:26:45,339
Stop.
Ooh.

272
00:26:45,417 --> 00:26:47,908
Let's ask in here.

273
00:27:19,651 --> 00:27:22,484
Are you
the proprietor?
I am.

274
00:27:22,554 --> 00:27:26,490
<i>What do you beggars want?</i>
<i>[Maleva]</i>
<i>Wejust want to ask you, sir,</i>

275
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:29,493
<i>about the Doctor Frankenstein.</i>

276
00:27:29,561 --> 00:27:33,497
Frankenstein?
Don't mention that name
around this town.

277
00:27:33,565 --> 00:27:36,329
Oh, please, won't you
tell us where he lives?

278
00:27:45,477 --> 00:27:47,411
There.

279
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:53,643
That's his
burial place.

280
00:27:53,719 --> 00:27:56,517
The fire destroyed him
and all his misdeeds.

281
00:27:56,588 --> 00:27:58,954
He's dead?
Oh, but he can't be.

282
00:27:59,024 --> 00:28:00,992
He didn't die
any too soon for us.

283
00:28:01,059 --> 00:28:03,550
We all wish that
he'd never been born.

284
00:28:03,628 --> 00:28:05,721
What did you want
with him?

285
00:28:05,797 --> 00:28:08,231
I heard he was
a great doctor...

286
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:12,327
who could help people that
other doctors couldn't cure.

287
00:28:12,404 --> 00:28:16,340
<i>Him? Murder and crimes</i>
<i>was all he ever brought us.</i>

288
00:28:16,408 --> 00:28:18,740
<i>He harbored a monster</i>
<i>in his house,</i>

289
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:21,142
<i>a thing created</i>
<i>by black magic.</i>

290
00:28:21,213 --> 00:28:24,705

Come on.
Get out and stay out.

We don't want your kind
around here.

00:28:44,603 --> 00:28:47,367
Oh, keep your hands
off of me!

296
00:29:07,893 --> 00:29:11,226
Now I must
go on living.

297
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:14,129
There's no hope
for me to die.

298
00:29:51,803 --> 00:29:55,068
Wait! Stop!
Don't go!

299
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,584
Wait!
Don't go!

Frankenstein's
monster?

305
00:31:05,911 --> 00:31:09,142
No. The monster was burned
to death by Dr. Frankenstein.

306
00:31:09,214 --> 00:31:11,409
Yes, we found his bones
and buried them.

307
00:31:11,483 --> 00:31:13,610
How do you know they were
the monster's bones?

308
00:31:13,685 --> 00:31:17,143
She wasn't killed by a monster.
An animal bit her to death.

309
00:31:17,222 --> 00:31:19,486
I saw the wound
on her throat.

310
00:31:19,558 --> 00:31:23,153

00:39:19,971 --> 00:39:23,134
I thought that in
my position as mayor...

343
00:39:23,207 --> 00:39:26,040
I would take the liberty
of sending for you.

344
00:39:28,046 --> 00:39:30,844
- Did he say
his name is Taylor?
- Yes.

345
00:39:30,915 --> 00:39:32,940
And that's all
I know about him.

346
00:39:36,487 --> 00:39:39,183
Baroness Frankenstein,
Mr. Taylor.

347
00:39:40,391 --> 00:39:43,360
- Baroness.
- Mr. Taylor.

348
00:39:43,428 --> 00:39:47,228
<i>Come in, Mr. Taylor.</i>
<i>Come in, come in.</i>

349
00:39:47,298 --> 00:39:50,062
Do you mind if I speak to
the baroness alone, please?

350
00:39:50,134 --> 00:39:54,662
Why, uh...
Why, uh, certainly,
certainly.

351
00:39:56,841 --> 00:39:59,503
Now, uh, if, uh...

352
00:39:59,577 --> 00:40:03,638
If you need a witness
for the contract, Baroness,
I'm at your service.

353
00:40:03,715 --> 00:40:05,649
Thank you.

354
00:40:11,355 --> 00:40:14,347
Won't you please
sit down, Mr. Taylor?

355
00:40:14,425 --> 00:40:16,359
Thank you.

356
00:40:19,864 --> 00:40:22,025
I understand that
you want to buy our land.

357
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:25,536
No, l...
I wanted to meet you.

358
00:40:28,206 --> 00:40:30,936
I don't understand.
<i>I didn't know how</i>
<i>to find you,</i>

359
00:40:31,008 --> 00:40:33,602
and the mayor wouldn't
give me your address,

360
00:40:33,678 --> 00:40:36,977
so I felt that if I offered
to buy your land...

361
00:40:37,048 --> 00:40:39,243
that you'd be
sure to come.

362
00:40:39,317 --> 00:40:43,481
It's certainly
a most unusual way
to make an acquaintance.

363
00:40:43,554 --> 00:40:46,182
But now that you have gone
to all this trouble
to meet me,

364
00:40:46,257 --> 00:40:48,623
what can I really
do for you?

365
00:40:50,962 --> 00:40:52,759
I want
your father's records.

366
00:40:54,165 --> 00:40:57,464
<i>His experiments</i>
<i>with life and death.</i>

367
00:40:57,535 --> 00:41:00,265
<i>The records of the creation</i>
<i>of the monster.</i>

368
00:41:06,544 --> 00:41:08,603
My father's diary.

369
00:41:08,679 --> 00:41:11,341
Yes. You must
give it to me.

370
00:41:11,415 --> 00:41:13,406
I don't have
any records.

371
00:41:13,484 --> 00:41:15,418
If I had, l...

372
00:41:15,486 --> 00:41:18,478
I would have destroyed
them long ago.

373
00:41:18,556 --> 00:41:21,719
My father was
a great scientist,

374
00:41:21,793 --> 00:41:25,126
but all he created
brought unhappiness,

375
00:41:26,397 --> 00:41:28,331
terror.

376
00:41:31,836 --> 00:41:34,828
Oh, but you don't
understand.

377
00:41:34,906 --> 00:41:38,239
I must have them.
Won't you help me?

378
00:41:39,677 --> 00:41:43,670
I'm sorry, Mr. Taylor.
There is nothing I can do.

379
00:41:43,748 --> 00:41:46,046
The house burned down,

380
00:41:46,117 --> 00:41:48,347
and I have never set a foot
on that ground again...

381
00:41:48,419 --> 00:41:50,751
and never shall.

382
00:41:50,822 --> 00:41:53,290
And that's all
the information
I can give you.

383
00:41:53,357 --> 00:41:56,918
Well, is everything
settled, Baroness?

384
00:41:56,994 --> 00:41:59,121
No.

385
00:41:59,197 --> 00:42:01,927
We decided not to go through
with the sale after all.

386
00:42:05,736 --> 00:42:08,899
Why, that sounds like...
Yes, Baroness.

387
00:42:08,973 --> 00:42:12,602
It's the Festival of New Wine.
It begins tonight.

388
00:42:12,677 --> 00:42:15,703
It's beautiful.

389
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:18,408
Takes me back
to my childhood.

390
00:42:38,703 --> 00:42:42,537
Why don't you join us
tonight, Baroness,
as our guest of honor?

391
00:42:42,607 --> 00:42:45,804
You would take the first
train in the morning.

392
00:42:45,877 --> 00:42:49,005
Thank you, Mayor.
Of course I'll stay.

393
00:42:57,755 --> 00:43:01,020
You, too, Mr. Taylor.
I hope you will accept
the invitation...

394
00:43:01,092 --> 00:43:04,892
to be our guest tonight,
on behalf of our community.

395
00:43:04,962 --> 00:43:08,762
Thank you.
I'll be there.

396
00:45:47,425 --> 00:45:50,326

I don't want to live
eternally!

[All Murmuring]

401
00:46:13,417 --> 00:46:15,578
Good evening,
Mr. Talbot.

402
00:46:15,653 --> 00:46:17,587
I beg your pardon.

403
00:46:17,655 --> 00:46:21,091
You must be mistaken.
My name is Taylor.
I know you by Talbot.

404
00:46:21,158 --> 00:46:24,992
Lawrence Talbot.
You carry your identification
on your forehead.

405
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:39,903
Baroness Frankenstein,
Dr. Mannering.

406
00:46:39,977 --> 00:46:41,945
How do you do,
Dr. Mannering?

407
00:46:42,012 --> 00:46:44,378
Won't you sit down?
Thank you.

408
00:46:48,519 --> 00:46:50,680
How does it happen
that you're here, Doctor?

409
00:46:50,754 --> 00:46:52,722
I've been looking
for you, Mr. Talbot.

410
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:55,224
And you were
very easy to find.

411
00:46:55,292 --> 00:46:57,852
The newspapers told me
where to look for you.

412
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:03,591
Fontainbleu, Aachen,

413
00:47:03,667 --> 00:47:05,601
Elrad,

414
00:47:05,669 --> 00:47:07,899
and finally Vasaria.

415
00:47:07,972 --> 00:47:11,237
I simply followed the trail
and found you.

416
00:47:11,308 --> 00:47:13,640
Very clever of you,
wasn't it, Doctor?

417
00:47:13,711 --> 00:47:16,874
Mr. Talbot is returning
to England with me.

418
00:47:16,947 --> 00:47:19,780
I don't think that I care
to do that, Doctor.

419
00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:22,614
Baroness, will you give me
the honor of the next dance?

420
00:47:22,686 --> 00:47:24,620
Of course.

421
00:47:24,688 --> 00:47:26,656
At our Festival
of New Wine, gentlemen,

422
00:47:26,724 --> 00:47:28,658
it's a man's privilege
to ask any lady for a dance.

423
00:47:28,726 --> 00:47:31,217
And vice-versa.
Excuse us.

424
00:47:37,701 --> 00:47:40,101
Why have you
followed me?

425
00:47:40,171 --> 00:47:42,696
Talbot,
you're a murderer.

426
00:47:42,773 --> 00:47:45,867
Prove it.
You're insane at times,
and you know it.

427
00:47:45,943 --> 00:47:48,138
You're sane enough now,
though, to know
what you're doing.

428
00:47:48,212 --> 00:47:50,180
Why don't you let me
take care of you?

429
00:47:50,247 --> 00:47:52,613
Do you think it would do
any good to put me
in a lunatic asylum?

430
00:47:52,683 --> 00:47:55,083
You know that's
where you belong.
It's the only thing to do.

431
00:47:55,152 --> 00:47:58,610
That wouldn't do any good.
I'd only escape again,
sooner or later.

432
00:47:58,689 --> 00:48:00,816
We might be able
to cure you.
Might prevent you...

433
00:48:00,891 --> 00:48:04,327
I only want to die.
That's why I'm here.

434
00:48:04,395 --> 00:48:07,296
If I ever find peace,
I'll find it here.

435
00:48:07,364 --> 00:48:10,595
You understand.
Why don't you help me?

436
00:48:10,668 --> 00:48:12,602
Sit down.

437
00:48:16,006 --> 00:48:18,702
How can I help you?

438
00:48:18,776 --> 00:48:21,574
Dr. Frankenstein
left a diary.

439
00:48:21,645 --> 00:48:25,012
In it are his records
of the secrets
of life and death.

440
00:48:28,986 --> 00:48:31,648
<i>If I can find</i>
<i>Dr. Frankenstein's diary,</i>

441
00:48:31,722 --> 00:48:34,282
<i>I can break this curse</i>
<i>and find peace in death.</i>

442
00:48:34,358 --> 00:48:37,225
<i>[Dr. Mannering]</i>
<i>That's morbid.</i>
<i>Besides,</i>

443
00:48:37,294 --> 00:48:40,661
Dr. Frankenstein's
experiments were considered
rather extraordinary.

444
00:48:40,731 --> 00:48:43,097
Medical science never,
never recognized them.

445
00:48:43,167 --> 00:48:46,659
That's just it.
Why don't you ask
that girl, his daughter?

446
00:48:46,737 --> 00:48:49,297
She can tell you about
things Dr. Frankenstein did...

447
00:48:49,373 --> 00:48:51,603
that your medical science
has never heard of.

448
00:48:51,675 --> 00:48:54,644
Talbot, I'm appealing
to your better nature...

449
00:48:54,712 --> 00:48:56,942
while you can still
think normally.

450
00:48:57,014 --> 00:49:01,417
The moon will be full again
soon. You must come back with
me while there's still time.

451
00:49:01,485 --> 00:49:05,512
Isn't there somebody
that could understand?

452

they're hiding in those ruins.
