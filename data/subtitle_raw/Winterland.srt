1
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,353
Hello? Mother?

2
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,469
I can hear you How are you?
I'll call you back.

3
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,071
Hang up!
Yes, I'll call you back.

4
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:10,398
Hello? Mother?
How are you ?

5
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,350
I'm fine and you?
Did you get the money I sent you?

6
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,879
It's for the jewellery
and the plane ticket.

7
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,989
Yes, it's so cold
that the sea has frozen.

8
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,874
Yes, I'm just fine.

9
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,798
WINTERLAND

10
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:03,792
Mother, how is she?

11
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,191
Yes, I got the video cassette
I like it

12
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,270
She's beautiful like an angel.

13
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,714
It's me.
Look at the picture. It's of me.

14
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,879
It's a picture of me

15
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,271
-But it's just a picture.
-Yes

16
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,435
When and where did
the wedding take place?

17
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:13,109
In Kurdistan in Iraq
About three months ago, I think

18
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:19,039
-Why weren't you there?
-Because of the war in Iraq.

19
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,470
Well, there's nothing in
our guidelines about this.

20
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,158
A marriage without a groom
How long have you known each other?

21
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:34,359
-About a year
-But you've never met her?

22
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:39,071
Oh,yes!
Because I call her, and she calls me.

23
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:44,633
And because
I write letters to her about love.

24
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,679
And she writes
letters to me about love.

25
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,469
Well, I'll write
that the picture is of you.

26
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,712
-That you're the groom.
-Thank you.

27
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,157
-Hello, Mirza !
-Selamu aleikum, how are you?

28
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,629
-Fine. And you?
-Where are you heading?

29
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,554
To work.
Why are you out in the cold?

30
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,109
I don't know.

31
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,909
Do you think they'll
put us to any use some day?

32
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,834
-l have e no idea .
-Neither do I!

33
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,879
I hope to see
you and your wife at the wedding.

34
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:49,434
-Sure, we look forward to it
-Why walk? I'll give you a lift.

35
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,435
Thanks but l prefer to walk,
like everyone else .

36
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,831
-Well, goodbye
-Go with God

37
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,232
I've got great news!

38
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,235
Fermes has
been granted a residence permit.

39
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,518
Yes, she'll be here soon.

40
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:28,279
Sherko, you promised me a satellite
dish three months ago!

41
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:32,718
Just bring me
the biggest dish you've got.

42
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,634
Careful! Don't drop it!

43
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,272
Your wife will be happy
to get all those Kurdish channels

44
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:46,069
- as she doesn't speak Norwegian.

45
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,234
I've waited a year for this day .
This ls really great

46
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:55,234
This is the best dish in town.

47
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,550
Congratulations!

48
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,595
I've said it a hundred times.
You've got a gorgeous wife!

49
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,510
Words can't describe
the beauty of this princess.

50
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:27,195
-You should get a girl from home too
-I'll never marry a Kurdish girl

51
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,956
-Where do I get a kilo of gold?
-It's just a formality

52
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,192
You don't really need to buy it.

53
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,874
Forget it.

54
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,472
There are lots of women here.
They give me everything.

55
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:46,155
Money, booze.

56
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,392
And women here are experienced

57
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,313
Unlike the ladies back home

58
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,948
They leave you in the end .

59
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,671
So you're getting married
to avoid ending up alone?

60
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,992
Sherko,
it's a different word altogether

61
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,232
I'm entering a new phase in life

62
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:12,030
Fermes and I will have a son .
He'll carry my name.

63
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,192
I'm not getting married

64
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,750
Please, Mirza take the front seat

65
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,830
-Well has she landed?
-No, I can't see her.

66
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:19,114
-Isn't that her?
-No, don' even look at that woman.

67
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,354
It's her, but she's...

68
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,158
Renas?

69
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,438
It's her!
Give her the flowers, Renas.

70
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,552
-These are from Renas. Welcome.
-Thank you.

71
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,190
Welcome!

72
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:49,915
It's cold and snowy here,
but the houses are warm.

73
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,833
Follow me, please.

74
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,432
Please enter, Fermesk

75
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,273
Welcome!

76
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,954
This is the kitchen.

77
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,199
There's the living room.

78
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,158
And the bedroom ls p there.

79
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:59,796
These shoes are from your family .

80
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:13,193
-Mom has made this pajamas for you
-Thank you very much

81
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,268
I've only invited people I know.

82
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,158
FERMESK & RENAS

83
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,072
Hello?

84
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,550
Who is this?
Father-in-law, is that you?

85
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:37,033
Everything's fine with us
With Fermesk as well

86
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,272
What's the problem?

87
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,675
What?

88
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,990
Five thousand dollars?

89
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,236
I can't keep supporting you forever.

90
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:08,233
-She threw you out already?
-She had such a lovely voice on the phone.

91
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:13,554
-And I fell in love with her photos
-A photo never tells the truth.

92
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:20,239
I gazed at it for months I fell
in love with the girl in the picture.

93
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:25,030
-She's the same girl, only fatter
-Did you say ''fat''?

94
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,193
I saw how fat she was at the airport.

95
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,832
But I told myself:
''It's the princess, only in XXL''

96
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:41,317
I don't mean any harm
I can see you're a bit tense.

97
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:47,919
Go home to your wife
You know, having one woman in bed -

98
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:52,551
- beats dreaming about nine
Go home, brother.

99
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,278
Sherko? Where's the towel?

100
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,319
-I'm coming
-Who's that woman?

101
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,156
Just anther girlfriend.
Now head back home.

102
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,676
-You're the man
-Bye

103
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,989
Take care. Bye.

<i>I, you, him</i>

107
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,631
Isn't it hard to fall in love with
a woman you've never met before?

108
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,917
No. Maybe in the beginning.

109
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:15,551
But wasn't 't sIe shocked
by the cold and the dark weather?

110
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:20,874
Why do you ask?
Of course it's a shock to her.

111
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,430
What if you
found your self in a desert?

112
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:29,151
No, I'm from a big city,
not from Sahara.

113
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:40,270
-Johan can get reindeer cheap.
-It's not about money

114
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:45,355
I'll do my duty as a man,
and get this wedding right.

115
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:52,153
-Listen, I've never done this before.
-It's just like slaughtering chicken.

116
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:06,634
-We must stop. It can't breathe.
-We'll be there soon

117
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,554
-Well, I hope so
-Very soon

118
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,633
Hello, Johan!

119
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,997
Hi, Johan.

120
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,471
-Let's get started.
-Does he have a knife?

121
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,952
-Johan, do you have a sharp knife?
-Sure.

122
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:38,352
-Good
-Are you going to do the job?

123
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,637
No he is. Sherk.

124
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,157
-Get it! Hurry!
-Shit!

125
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,794
Grab it!

126
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,278
-You must slaughter it towards Mecca
-Where is Mecca?

127
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,793
Where the sun rises.

128
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,316
-I can't You do it
-You promised!

129
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,118
I don't know where Mecca is!

130
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,790
If we don't do it towards Mecca,
it won't be Hal-Al

131
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,396
-Well, ask him
-Johan? Come here.

132
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,351
Where does the sun rise?

133
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,910
Excuse me? You know about sun?

134
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,229
What's going on?

135
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,473
They want to know where Mecca is .

136
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,154
Where the sun rises.

137
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,517
Just point somewhere,
and we'll get this over with.

138
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,796
Just point!

139
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:50,192
-Right. In that direction.
-Lay it down on the ground.

140
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,439
This knife is dull.

141
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,669
Oh, shit

142
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,437
-I'll be damned.
-No prayer?

143
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,955
-Sure, I said ''Bismillah''
-I didn't hear it.

144
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,873
I just didn't say it out loud.

145
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:20,191
Here, take the knife.

146
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,636
(Norwegian course)

147
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,596
-Welcome home.
-Thanks .

148
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,957
What have you done with the house?

149
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:14,353
-I thought it would be nice.
-Wasn't it fine as it was?

150
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:51,717
What do you mean if
I've become a man or not.

151
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:55,156
Hello? Father?

152
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,993
What's mother trying to say?

153
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,436
Asking if we've done it or not?

154
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,879
I realize you want
to know when it's happened.

155
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:11,716
We need time
We'll wait until after the wedding.

156
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,440
She's just arrived.

157
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,592
I realize you want to know.

158
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,992
Yes, the wedding night.
Goodbye.

159
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,712
Fermes, are you a sleep?

160
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:01,310
Renas, we have to wait.
We're not yet married.

161
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,510
We're man and wife.

162
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:11,709
We're only married on paper.

163
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:16,277
Can't I wear a wedding dress first?

164
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,712
-Hi.
-Hi.

165
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:11,915
Sorry if it seems a bit dreary
It's the middle of winter, after all

166
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:17,438
-But I've put a heater in your room.
-Thank you.

167
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:23,118
He welcomes on behalf
of himself and the entire staff.

168
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,396
It's a great honor -

169
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:30,475
- to have us as guests
He'll personally look after us

170
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,949
Well, thank you.

171
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,834
Right, welcome.

172
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,309

173
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,588
Fermes?

174
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,989
Fermes?

175
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,156
What's wrong, Fermes?

176
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:51,678
-Aren't you going to undress?
-I'm cold.

177
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,313
We're man and wife now

178
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:15,993
I don't know how to tell you this
I'm not the girl you think I am.

179
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:26,193
-What?
-I'm sorry, I just.

180
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,950
I lost my virginity in Kurdistan.

181
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,595
Oh, Renas.

182
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:22,239
Renass! Renass!

183
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:29,269
-Will you send me back?
-Come on The ice is thick!

184
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:32,597
Don't be afraid

185
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:37,117
You won't go through the ice
It's safe Look!

186
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,477
Come on, let's go

187
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:38,112
I don't want to go back, Renas
But I couldn't lie to you

188
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:42,034
You'v already lied to me for a year.
To hide something is a sin.

189
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:50,552
-He died . l never saw him again.
-Who else have you been seeing?

190
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,792
Nobody.
I'm no like you think.

191
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,272
We'll live together for a year.

192
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,830
You'll sleep in your room, I in mine

193
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,039
Then we'll get a divorce.
l won't touch you .

194
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,590
After a year, you'll return home.

195
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,673
Yes.

196
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:22,071
The wedding was very nice , yes.

197
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,313
Of course we did it!

198
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,758
Right,' goodbye.

199
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:43,311
Yes, mother?
What is it now? What?

200
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:47,155
Yes, Fermesk is my wife.

201
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:53,395
Norwegian class ?
Yes, she can start tomorrow.

202
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,680
''Ø''!

203
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,148
''Å''!

204
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:22,199
It's essential to learn the letters

205
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,240
-May I help you?
-Excuse me.

206
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:31,951
Fermes, my wife, forgot her lunch.

207
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:36,833
-Well, I go ahead.
-Thanks .

208
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:42,437
You forgot this, dear. Thank you

209
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,950
-Make up your mind. Which direction?
-To the right

210
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,237
-No, to the left.
-What about now ?

211
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,312
-That's perfect!
-A nd now ?

212
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,677
There's no picture .

213
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:09,516
Tell me when you find
the Kurdish channels.

214
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,919
-Nothing
-Just shout if you find anything

215
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:18,038
There it is!

216
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:24,115
I can see a music video on TV!

217
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:31,318
We lost the picture.

218
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,158
This is driving me crazy.

219
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,676
<i>What happened
to the yapragh, Renas ?</i>

220
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,752
I threw it away.

221
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,553
Did you throw away our dinner?

222
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:07,713
It was starting to smell
I threw it away.

223
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,470
I hate taking the bus here.

224
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:44,189
Nobody speaks to anyone.

225
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:48,148
They just stare into the space .
Nobody offers you a hand.

226
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:57,355
People up here are friendly, but
it takes time to get to know them.

227
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:01,752
You just have to reach out to them.

228
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:33,480
Norwegians friendly .
Look, I'll talk to that guy .

229
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:37,349
-Leave him alone.
-Watch this.

230
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,870
-Hei
-Hei.

231
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,795
-Cold today
-Yeah

232
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:54,115
-It wasn't this cold yesterday.
-No, it wasn't.

233
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:58,318
Maybe it'll snow?

234
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:05,950
Have a nice day .
l told you they 're friendly .

235
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:26,236
<i>This ls how you eat it.
Have some globaaroshaa. It's kurdish.</i>

236
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,595
<i>Globarosha</i>

237
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,754
-Doesn't your wife eat pork either?
-No.

238
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:40,072
-Why doesn't she eat pork?
-Because it makes you impotent.

239
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:43,158
-You know?
-Yeah

240
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,917
You eat them like this .
Look at me.

241
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,709
-What are you eating, Atle?
-Boiled ham.

242
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,757
Any luck with the ladies lately?

243
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:54,872
-Why the kisss ?
-To show them we're married.

244
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,873
No kisses from now on.

245
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,228
Why are you laughing?

246
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,429
Who was that man?

247
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:23,831
-Who?
-Stop acting like a fool.

248
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,429
He's just another student.

249
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:40,115
You told me he was rich.
But he's got nothing!

250
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:45,400
Just a large, empty house
All right, mother.

251
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,910
We'll talk later.

252
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:52,550
All right, goodbye.

253
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:05,231
-Hello Mirza.
-Hello. How are you doing?

254
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:10,030
-Fine, thanks will you come inside?
-Is Renas home?

255
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:14,796
-He'll be here soon. Come inside.
-I'll wait here.

256
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:20,034
-I need him to read a letter for me
-You can wait inside.

257
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:23,670
Thank you , but I'll wait here.

258
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:27,469
Renas seems happy.
He's found a good wife.

259
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,631
Thank you.

260
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,712
Goodbye for now.

261
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:37,190
Hello, Mirza.
Welcome.

262
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:40,318
-How are you ?
-Fine, thanks.

263
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,359
The letter
from immigration has arrived.

264
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:47,353
I hope it's good news

265
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,352
What does it say?

266
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:57,230
''Application
for residence permit denied''

267
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:01,516
Is it good news?

268
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:08,870
Say something.
The suspense is killing me.

269
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:15,517
The immigration office has
granted you a residence permit.

270
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:20,959
Praise the Lord!
Is it temporary or permanent?

271
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:36,273
I couldn't tell Mirza the truth
It would have broken his heart.

272
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:45,476
Have you been at our house?

273
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:52,753
-Why didn't you tell me?
-I thought we were divorced.

274
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:58,632
Sherko was here
I've got the right to know.

275
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:03,590
He just took a quick look
at the satellite dish.

276
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:07,355
Get out of here!

277
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:50,756
Fermes is gone.
Have you seen her?

278
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:53,718
No, she's not a home.

279
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:57,429
She took all her things and left.

280
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,958
She doesn't know anyone here!

281
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:06,351
I don't know where she might be.

282
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,032
I've said things to her.

283
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,270
Fermes

284
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,197
Fermes

285
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,076
Fermes

286
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:40,756
Your residence
application was denied.

287
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:45,789
How do you know?
You don't speak much Norwegian.

288
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,633
It says ''denied''.

289
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,952
''Denied'' was the first word
I learned in this country.

290
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:57,796
I've waited so long
Maybe it's better this way.

291
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:01,396
What do you mean, Mirza?

292
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,875
I don't belong here.

293
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:10,989
I'm an old man.
I have lived my life somewhere else.

294
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,037
But you are young.
You should stay.

295
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:17,916
You love that poor man,
like he loves you.

296
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:23,279
If you must lie to get along,
your happiness won't last

297
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,716
Go home, my dear

298
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,917
Renas needs you.

299
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:36,719
Go home to your husband
It's the best thing you can do

300
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,952
Without you, he is nothing.

301
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:47,869
Go home, God bless you

302
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,913
Where have you been?

303
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,712
I came back to talk with you

304
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:13,032
Then go ahead and talk.
Come on, come inside.

305
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:20,032
-No, not as long as you're angry.
-What are you talking about?

306
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:25,194
I don't want to live like this!
I'd rather be divorced!

307
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:29,478
I could have
sent you back the first night

308
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:36,312
-Come home
-Don't touch me!

309
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:40,830
Come back! Don't go.

310
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:57,036
Fermesl
Fermes, stopp running!

311
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:59,351
Stop!

312
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,711
-Get up.
-Go away.

313
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:14,711
Fermes, come on. Let's go.

314
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,713
Give me your hand.

315
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:23,352
-Let's go.
-No.

316
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:29,914
You don't want to talk
You lied to me, to the whole family.

317
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:33,197
You lied as well, have you forgotten?

318
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:37,239
Renas
We didn't send these pictures.

319
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,709
It's not our fault.

320
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:54,311
Fermes, our families are far away .
It's you and me now .

321
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:01,399
Give me your hand and let's go

322
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:04,358
I won't send you back

323
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,511
Come on, darling.

324
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:10,109
Let's go home.

325
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:58,359
Hello?
Father-in-law, is that you?

326
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:02,790
Why says l've mentioned
the money to anyone?

327
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,393
What?

328
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,950
Don't you believe me?

329
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:12,830
Stop calling us
We've had enough!

330
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,355
Hello?

331
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:31,078
-What's the matter, Renas?
-It's your father

332
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:36,189
It's either mother,
father or uncle

333
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:38,476
The whole lot!

334
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:56,710
Thanks.
