"Howl" for Carl Solomon.

3
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:30,480
<i>I saw the best minds</i>
<i>of my generation</i>

4
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:32,750
<i>destroyed by madness,</i>

5
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:36,754
<i>starving hysterical naked,</i>

6
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:40,355
<i>dragging themselves through</i>
<i>the negro streets at dawn</i>

7
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,627
<i>looking for an angry fix,</i>

8
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,770
<i>angel headed hipsters burning</i>

9
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:49,136
<i>for the ancient heavenly</i>
<i>connection to the starry dynamo</i>

10
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,175
<i>in the machinery of night,</i>

11
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:53,910
<i>who poverty and tatters and</i>

12
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:55,912
<i>hollow eyed and high</i>

13
00:01:56,049 --> 00:02:00,782
<i>sat up smoking in the supernatural</i>
<i>darkness of cold water flats</i>

14
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,118
<i>floating across the tops</i>
<i>of cities contemplating jazz!</i>

15
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,406
Sometimes I feel in command
when I'm writing.

16
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:15,378
When I'm in the heat
of some truthful tears, yes.

17
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:18,513
Other times...
most of the time, not.

18
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:22,253
You know, just diddling around...

19
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:24,955
woodcarving, you know,
finding a pretty shape,

20
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,725
like most of my poetry.

21
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:32,797
There's only been a few times
when I've reached a state of...

22
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,998
complete control...

23
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,107
Probably a piece of "Howl,"
and...

24
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:40,906
one or two moments
in other poems.

25
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:48,950
The beginning
of the fear for me was

26
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:54,058
what would my father think
of something that I would write.

27
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:56,824
At the time, writing "Howl,"

28
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:58,486
I assumed when writing it that

29
00:04:58,631 --> 00:04:59,962
it was not something
that would be published,

30
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:01,088
because...

31
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:05,000
I wouldn't want my daddy
to see what was in there.

32
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,470
So, I assumed it wouldn't be
published, therefore, I could

33
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:09,074
write anything that I wanted to.

34
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:07,931
<i>I saw the best minds</i>
<i>of my generation</i>

35
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:09,967
<i>destroyed by madness,</i>

36
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,798
<i>starving hysterical naked,</i>

37
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:17,105
<i>draggling themselves through</i>
<i>the negro streets at dawn</i>

38
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:19,677
<i>looking for an angry fix,</i>

39
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:24,610
<i>angel headed hipsters</i>

40
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:27,447
<i>burning for the</i>
<i>ancient heavenly connection</i>

41
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:30,681
<i>to the starry dynamo</i>
<i>in the machinery of night,</i>

42
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:35,992
<i>who poverty and tatters</i>

43
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:38,063
<i>and hollow eyed and high</i>

44
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:40,631
<i>sat up smoking</i>
<i>in the supernatural darkness</i>

45
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:42,758
<i>of cold water flats</i>

46
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:47,236
<i>floating across the tops of</i>
<i>cities, contemplating jazz,</i>

47
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:52,300
<i>who passed through universities</i>
<i>with radiant cool eyes</i>

48
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:54,208
<i>hallucinating Arkansas and</i>

49
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:58,113
<i>Blake-light tragedy</i>
<i>among the scholars of war,</i>

50
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:02,081
<i>who were expelled</i>
<i>from the academies for crazy</i>

51
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:06,157
<i>& publishing obscene odes</i>
<i>on the windows of the skull,</i>

52
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:09,822
<i>who cowered in</i>
<i>unshaven rooms in underwear,</i>

53
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:12,089
<i>burning their money</i>
<i>in wastebaskets</i>

54
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:15,257
<i>and listening to the Terror</i>
<i>through the wall,</i>

55
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:18,193
<i>who got busted</i>
<i>in their pubic beards</i>

56
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:22,330
<i>returning through Laredo with a
<i>belt of marijuana for New York,</i>

57
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,467
<i>who ate fire</i>
<i>in paint hotels or drank</i>

58
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:28,273
<i>turpentine in Paradise Alley,</i>

59
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:29,711
<i>death</i>

60
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:33,979
<i>or purgatoried their torsos</i>
<i>night after night with dreams,</i>

61
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,918
<i>with drugs,</i>
<i>with waking nightmares,</i>

62
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:41,652
<i>alcohol and cock</i>
<i>and endless balls,</i>

63
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,134
What I wanted to read into
the record, Your Honor, is

64
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:56,503
not very much,
but it is pertinent to our case.

65
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:59,736
Why aren't you at the trial?

66
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:02,109
'Cause...

67
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:04,716
the trial's not about me.

68
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:08,415
As much as I have to thank them

69
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:10,545
completely for my fame...

70
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,056
it's the publisher,
Lawrence Ferlinghetti that was

71
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:15,956
busted for selling

72
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:18,063
obscene materials.

73
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:22,930
What I want to show is on
the first page inside of "Howl."

74
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:26,698
it says, "All these books
are published in Heaven."

75
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:28,065
And...

76
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:31,104
I don't quite understand that,
but anyway,

77
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:32,438
let the record show, Your Honor,

78
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:35,376
it's published by
the City Lights Pocketbook Shop.

79
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,644
Mr. Ferlinghetti could go
to jail if convicted?

80
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:41,218
I hope not.
That would be terrible.

81
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:05,574
May I have your name, please?

82
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,038
Gail Potter.

83
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:09,647
And have you done
any writing yourself?

84
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:11,443
Yes, I have done considerable.

85
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:15,680
I was on an NBC station for
10 years while I was teaching.

86
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:17,717
I was
community service director,

87
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:19,586
educational coordinator...

88
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:21,787
I have rewritten "Faust."

89
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:24,362
it took me three years
to do that, but I did it.

90
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:26,055
I rewrote "Everyman."

91
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:30,201
That isn't as funny
as you might think.

92
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:31,166
Pardon me, madam.

93
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:32,362
Ladies and gentlemen,

94
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:34,564
this is a trial
that involves serious issues.

95
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:36,265
Now kindly accord the witness

96
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,967
the courtesy you would want
to be accorded.

97
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:38,701
Alright.

98
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:41,972
And did you form an opinion as
to whether or not the book called

99
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:46,016
"Howl and Other Poems"
has any literary merit?

100
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:49,619
I think it has
no literary merit.

101
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:53,750
Go ahead.

102
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:56,088
in order to have literary style,
you must have

103
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:59,425
form, diction,
fluidity, clarity.

104
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:01,897
Now, I am speaking
only of style.

105
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:04,366
And in content,
every great piece of literature,

106
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:08,269
anything that can really be
classified as literature, is...

107
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:09,499
of some moral greatness,

108
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:11,837
and I think this fails
to the nth degree.

109
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:13,334
I see.

110
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:15,379
Can you think of
any other reasons?

111
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:16,344
Yes...

112
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:17,642
Use of language.

113
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,445
in regards to the figures
of speech he uses,

114
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:21,610
he fails in rhetoric,
of course,

115
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:24,018
for one thing, because
his figures of speech are

116
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:26,784
crude, and you feel like
you are going through the gutter

117
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:28,723
when you read that stuff.

118
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:31,825
I didn't linger on it long,
I assure you.

119
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:35,193
You may cross examine.

120
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:38,400
Step down.

121
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:42,240
There's something more you want?

122
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:43,939
Step down.

123
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:47,069
Mr. Ehrlich doesn't want
to cross examine.

124
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:49,113
You're through with me?

125
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:50,415
Step down.

126
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:54,651
What is "The Beat Generation"?

127
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:59,284
There is no Beat Generation.

128
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:03,352
it's just a bunch of guys,
trying to get published.

129
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:09,460
Why don't you tell me
how you started writing poetry?

130
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:14,964
I started writing poetry
because I was a dope,

131
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,638
and my father wrote poetry.

132
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:21,710
So I began writing
rhymes like him.

133
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,915
And then I went to Columbia
University and I fell in love

134
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,015
with Jack Kerouac.

135
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:43,568
Until I was 18, I was a virgin.

136
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,430
I was unable to reach out
to anybody's body.

137
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:49,735
To reach out to desire.

138
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,172
I just felt...

139
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:54,277
Chained.

140
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,952
Jack gave me permission
to open up.

141
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:04,282
He's a romantic poet.

142
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:07,618
And he taught me that
writing is personal,

143
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,161
that it comes from
the writer's own person.

144
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:12,121
His body,

145
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:14,064
his breathing rhythm,

146
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:15,491
his actual talk.

147
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:22,298
Eventually I developed a much
deeper sense of confession.

148
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:23,999
I needed to...

149
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:28,512
express my feelings to him,
but he didn't want to hear them.

150
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:31,707
So I had to find a new way
of expressing them...

151
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,113
a way that would entrance him.

152
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:37,689
This is good here.

153
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:40,986
"I was offered refreshments
which I accepted.

154
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:42,890
"I ate a sandwich of pure meat.

155
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:45,258
"Enormous sandwich of
human flesh, I noticed,

156
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:46,796
"while I was chewing on it.

157
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,059
"it also included
a dirty asshole!"

158
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,424
That's good!

159
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,997
That's good!
The meat and the asshole.

160
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:54,834
Allen, alright.

161
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:58,068
And then I realized
that if I actually

162
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:02,745
admitted and confessed
the secret tenderness

163
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:05,077
of my soul in my writing,

164
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:08,209
he would understand nakedly
who I was. And so...

165
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:11,414
that sincere talk
replaced the earlier

166
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:14,822
imitative rhyming
that I was doing for my father.

167
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:21,090
Jack was the first person
I really opened up to and said,

168
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:23,762
"I'm a homosexual."

169
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:30,832
I very soon realized that nobody
was really shocked by anything.

170
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:34,005
Unless you're out
murdering people, you know,

171
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:38,974
People would never
really be shocked by

172
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:41,143
an expression of feeling.

173
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:47,817
Really I wrote "Howl" for Jack.

174
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:55,123
<i>Who chained themselves to</i>
<i>subways for the endless ride</i>

175
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:58,293
<i>from Battery to holy Bronx</i>
<i>on benzedrine</i>

176
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:02,200
<i>until the noise of wheels</i>
<i>and children brought them down</i>

177
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:05,868
<i>shuddering mouth wracked</i>
<i>and battered bleak of brain</i>

178
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:10,573
<i>all drained of brilliance</i>
<i>in the drear light of Zoo,</i>

179
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:13,046
<i>Who talked continuously 70 hours</i>

180
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:16,154
<i>from park to pad</i>
<i>to bar to Bellevue</i>

181
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:18,848
<i>to museum</i>
<i>to the Brooklyn Bridge,</i>

182
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:24,390
<i>A lost battalion of</i>
<i>platonic conversationalists</i>

183
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,054
<i>jumping down the stoops,</i>

184
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:29,361
<i>off fire escapes,</i>
<i>off windowsills,</i>

185
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:31,025
<i>off Empire State,</i>

186
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,899
<i>out of the moon,</i>

187
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:38,637
<i>yacketayakking</i>
<i>screaming vomiting</i>

188
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:42,304
<i>whispering facts and memories</i>
<i>and anecdotes and</i>

189
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:47,385
<i>eyeball kicks and shocks</i>
<i>of hospitals and jails and wars</i>

190
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:54,590
<i>who lit cigarettes</i>
<i>in boxcars boxcars boxcars</i>

191
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:59,562
<i>racketing through snow toward</i>
<i>lonesome farms in grand father night</i>

192
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:03,259
<i>who studied Plotinus</i>
<i>Poe St. John of the Cross,</i>

193
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:05,732
<i>telepathy and bop kabbalah</i>

194
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:10,467
<i>because the cosmos instinctively</i>
<i>vibrated at their feet in Kansas,</i>

195
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,501
<i>who loned it</i>
<i>through the streets of Idaho</i>

196
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:16,080
<i>seeking visionary Indian angels</i>

197
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:19,241
<i>who were</i>
<i>visionary Indian angels,</i>

198
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:23,015
<i>who jumped in limousines</i>
<i>with the Chinaman of Oklahoma</i>

199
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:27,751
<i>on the Impulse of winter midnight</i>
<i>streetlight small town ran,</i>

200
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:31,054
<i>who reappeared on the West Coast</i>

201
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:34,859
<i>investigating the FBI</i>
<i>in beards and shorts</i>

202
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,230
<i>with big pacifist eyes</i>

203
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:39,303
<i>sexy in their dark skin</i>

204
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,896
<i>passing out</i>
<i>incomprehensible leaflets,</i>

205
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:46,771
<i>who burned cigarette holes</i>
<i>in their arms</i>

206
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:50,746
<i>protesting the narcotic</i>
<i>tobacco haze of Capitalism,</i>

207
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:57,316
<i>who distributed Super Communist</i>
<i>pamphlets in Union Square</i>

208
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:00,425
<i>weeping and undressing</i>
<i>while the sirens of Los Alamos</i>

209
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:03,357
<i>walled them down</i>
<i>and walled down Wall,</i>

210
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:06,555
<i>and the Staten Island Ferry</i>
<i>also walled,</i>

211
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:13,537
<i>who let themselves be fucked in</i>
<i>the ass by saintly motorcyclists</i>

212
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:16,163
<i>and screamed with joy,</i>

213
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:24,610
<i>who blew and were blown by those</i>
<i>human seraphim, the sailors,</i>

214
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:28,618
<i>caresses of Atlantic</i>
<i>and Caribbean love.</i>

215
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,597
The problem, when it
comes to literature, is this:

216
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,563
There are many writers
who have preconceived ideas

217
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:46,295
about what literature
is supposed to be,

218
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:50,499
but their ideas seem to preclude

219
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:53,008
everything that makes them
most interesting

220
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:55,136
in casual conversation.

221
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:56,479
Their faggishness,

222
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:58,114
their solitude,

223
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,308
their neuroses,

224
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:01,612
their goofiness,

225
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:02,982
their campiness,

226
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:06,785
or, even
their masculinity at times.

227
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:09,587
Because they think that
they're gonna write something

228
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:11,992
that sounds like something else
that they've read before,

229
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:13,359
instead of

230
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:14,625
sounds like them.

231
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:17,167
Or, comes from their own life.

232
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,428
We all talk amongst ourselves;

233
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:21,505
we have a common understanding,

234
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:25,269
we say anything we want to say.
We talk about our assholes,

235
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:26,776
we talk about our cocks,

236
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:29,710
we talk about
who we fucked last night,

237
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:31,941
or who we're gonna
fuck tomorrow,

238
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:34,814
or what kind of
love affair we're in, or

239
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:38,548
when we got drunk and had a broom
stick shoved up our ass in the

240
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,453
Hotel Ambassador in Prague...

241
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:45,359
I mean, everyone tells
one's friends about that! Right?

242
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:46,395
So...

243
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:50,459
the question is, what happens
when you make a distinction

244
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:53,662
between what you tell your friends
and what you tell your Muse?

245
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:56,703
The trick is to break down
that distinction,

246
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:59,208
to approach your Muse as

247
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:02,939
frankly as you would talk
to yourself or to your friends.

248
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:10,916
it's the ability
to commit to writing to write

249
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:12,983
the same way that

250
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,285
you are.

251
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:19,254
<i>Who balled in the morning</i>
<i>in the evenings</i>

252
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:24,597
<i>in rose gardens and the grass</i>
<i>of public parks and cemeteries</i>

253
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:29,935
<i>scattering their semen freely</i>
<i>to whomever come who may,</i>

254
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:33,507
<i>Who hiccupped endlessly</i>
<i>trying to giggle</i>

255
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:38,105
<i>but wound up with a sob behind</i>
<i>a partition in a Turkish bath</i>

256
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:43,153
<i>with a blonde and naked angel</i>
<i>came to pierce them with a sword,</i>

257
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:46,883
The act of writing becomes,
like, a meditation exercise.

258
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:52,630
If you walk down the street
in New York for a few blocks,

259
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:56,598
you'll get this
gargantuan feeling of buildings.

260
00:18:56,735 --> 00:19:01,001
And, if you walk all day,
you'll be on the verge of tears.

261
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,001
But, you have to walk all day
before you get that sensation.

262
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:09,837
What I mean is, if you write
all day, you'll get into it.

263
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:13,440
Into your body, into your feelings,
into your consciousness...

264
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:19,082
I don't write enough
in that way.

265
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:35,797
<i>Who lost their loveboys to</i>
<i>the three old shrews of fate</i>

266
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:40,135
<i>the one eyed shrew</i>
<i>of the heterosexual dollar</i>

267
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:43,506
<i>the one eyed shrew</i>
<i>that winks out of the womb</i>

268
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:47,176
<i>and the one eyed shrew that</i>
<i>does nothing but sit on her ass</i>

269
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:51,915
<i>and snip the Intellectual golden</i>
<i>threads of the craftsman's loom</i>

270
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:56,759
<i>who copulated ecstatic and</i>
<i>Insatiate with a bottle of beer,</i>

271
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:59,420
<i>a sweetheart,</i>
<i>a package of cigarettes,</i>

272
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:01,829
<i>a candle and fell off the bed</i>

273
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:05,061
<i>and continued along the floor</i>
<i>and down the hall</i>

274
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,331
<i>and ended fainting on the wall</i>

275
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:09,497
<i>with a vision of</i>
<i>ultimate cunt and come</i>

276
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:12,508
<i>eluding the last gyzym</i>
<i>of consclousness,</i>

277
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:20,810
<i>who faded out</i>
<i>in vast sordid movies,</i>

278
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:22,784
<i>were shifted in dreams,</i>

279
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:26,516
<i>woke on a sudden Manhattan,</i>
<i>and picked themselves up</i>

280
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:30,424
<i>out of basements</i>
<i>hungover with heartless Tokay</i>

281
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:33,690
<i>and horrors of</i>
<i>Third Avenue Iron dreams</i>

282
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:36,858
<i>and stumbled to</i>
<i>unemployment offices,</i>

283
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:43,470
<i>who created</i>
<i>great suicidal dramas</i>

284
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:46,009
<i>on the apartment cliff banks</i>
<i>of the Hudson</i>

285
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:49,602
<i>under the wartime blue</i>
<i>floodlight of the moon</i>

286
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:53,684
<i>and their heads shall be crowned</i>
<i>with laurel in oblivion,</i>

287
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:56,479
<i>who wept at the romance</i>
<i>of the streets</i>

288
00:20:56,622 --> 00:21:00,319
<i>with their pushcarts</i>
<i>full of onions and bad music,</i>

289
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:04,495
<i>who sat in boxes breathing</i>
<i>in the darkness under the bridge,</i>

290
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:08,926
<i>and rose up to build</i>
<i>harpsichords in their lofts,</i>

291
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:18,943
<i>who scribbled all night rocking</i>
<i>and rolling over lofty incantations</i>

292
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:22,774
<i>which in the yellow morning</i>
<i>were stanzas of gibberish,</i>

293
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:26,946
<i>who were burned alive</i>
<i>in their Innocent flannel suits</i>

294
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:28,177
<i>on Madison Avenue</i>

295
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,481
<i>amid blasts of leaden verse</i>

296
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:34,558
<i>and the tanked up clatter</i>
<i>of the Iron regiments of fashion</i>

297
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:39,454
<i>and the nitroglycerine shrieks</i>
<i>of the fairies of advertising</i>

298
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:43,193
<i>and the mustard gas</i>
<i>of sinister intelligent editors,</i>

299
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:48,238
<i>or were run down by the drunken</i>
<i>taxicabs of Absolute Reality.</i>

300
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:56,373
Would you say that
"Howl" has any literary merit?

301
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:57,641
Yes.

302
00:21:57,783 --> 00:22:01,913
And I presume you understand
the whole thing, is that right?

303
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,451
I hope so.

304
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:06,283
it's not always easy
to know that one

305
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:09,519
understands exactly what
a contemporary poet is saying,

306
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:10,889
but I think I do.

307
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:14,232
Well, let's go
into some of this.

308
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:19,903
"With dreams, with drugs,
with waking nightmares,

309
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:24,338
"alcohol and cock
and endless balls."

310
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:27,708
What significance
does that have to you?

311
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,569
Well...

312
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:34,718
there are uprooted people
wandering around the United States,

313
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:36,011
dreaming,

314
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:37,984
drugged...

315
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:39,981
That's clear isn't it?

316
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:42,719
Even their waking hours
like nightmares,

317
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,489
loaded with liquor and...

318
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:48,360
enjoying, I take it,

319
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:52,334
a variety of indiscriminate
sexual experience.

320
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:55,937
You understand what
"angelheaded hipsters

321
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:58,838
"burning for the ancient
heavenly connection

322
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:02,606
"to the starry dynamo in the
machinery of night" means?

323
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:07,513
Sir, you can't translate
poetry into prose.

324
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:09,580
That's why it is poetry.

325
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:12,315
But what are
"angelheaded hipsters"?

326
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:32,568
I was working as a copyboy
at Associated Press,

327
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:35,908
and I was able to manage things.

328
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:39,039
Except that I was living in a
$13 a month, cold water apartment

329
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:41,709
filled with junkies and thieves.

330
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:46,518
So the place was being filled
with stolen silverware and

331
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:48,489
beautiful oaken furniture

332
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:51,494
taken from the lobbies
of apartment buildings.

333
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:55,595
At a certain point,

334
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:58,802
I figured that things were
getting too hot, and that...

335
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,905
I'd better get out of there.
You know, get out from under.

336
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:01,767
So...

337
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:04,501
I piled myself
and all my manuscripts

338
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:06,235
into the back of some guy's car

339
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:08,608
that turned out to be stolen.

340
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:10,472
You know, he had in the back,

341
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:13,778
all these stolen suits
and suitcases and silverware,

342
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,387
and he turned the wrong way
up a one way street,

343
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:18,887
at the end of which
there was a police car.

344
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:21,584
So he swerves his car
to take a side road out,

345
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:24,987
and skidded and smashed
and papers flying...

346
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,860
my eyeglasses lost,
all the clothes upside down.

347
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,734
I jumped out, looked around, and

348
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:33,337
went back in the car
to find my notebooks, but

349
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:36,873
I couldn't find my eyeglasses,
so I couldn't find my papers.

350
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:39,238
The crowd was gathering around.

351
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:40,639
Chaos.

352
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:42,110
Chaos.

353
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:47,644
The easiest way
to get out of the whole thing,

354
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:49,185
as it turns out, was

355
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:53,485
to just go to the Psychiatric
Institute on 168th Street.

356
00:24:57,095 --> 00:25:01,532
I was in the looney bin
for eight months.

357
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,692
I met Carl Solomon there.

358
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,605
He was thinking
about the void, also

359
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,207
and such problems, and...

360
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:14,410
We spent months sitting around
asking ourselves whether the

361
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:16,844
authority of the doctors

362
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:19,382
and their sense of reality
was right for us

363
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:22,715
or whether we were right,
or you know what was happening.

364
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:26,689
And Carl was having problems

365
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:29,760
because he was receiving
shock treatment.

366
00:25:30,795 --> 00:25:34,287
I didn't have any of that,
no medication, no shock.

367
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:40,735
'Cause I'd promised the doctor
that I would be heterosexual.

368
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:43,139
And that's how I got out.

369
00:25:45,076 --> 00:25:49,012
Your mother was
institutionalized, wasn't she?

385

She died
at Pilgrim State Hospital.

404
00:27:45,864 --> 00:27:47,798
<i>I am not safe,</i>

405
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:54,194
<i>and now you're really in</i>
<i>the total animal soup of time...</i>

406
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:53,927
After I got out of
the mental hospital,

407
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:56,590
I had a period of fear where...

408
00:28:57,102 --> 00:28:59,036
I felt I had to
get out of New York.

409
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:04,633
I was questioning
my sense of reality versus the

410
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:07,506
social sense
that was being imposed on me.

411
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:09,246
it was a position that...

412
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:12,445
Many people in the hospital
came out with, you know,

413
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,711
a total self rejection,

414
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:17,953
a rejection of, you know,
their own universe.

415
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:21,155
Lip service, actually, to...

416
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:25,023
supposedly acceptable
social patterns.

417
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:28,398
But I was falling in love
over and over again,

418
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:30,501
and I kept writing
my poetry about

419
00:29:30,635 --> 00:29:32,330
the people
I was falling in love with.

420
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:33,801
All straight men.

421
00:29:34,906 --> 00:29:37,704
And I hitch hiked cross country

422
00:29:37,842 --> 00:29:40,606
from Denver
with my friend, Neal Cassady.

423
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:43,714
And Neal was very frenetic,

424
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:45,281
very charming,

425
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:47,884
and he had six thousand

426
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:51,147
girls across the continent
that were keeping him very busy.

427
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:56,556
Ok... um... no. Um...

428
00:29:57,762 --> 00:29:58,592
Kiss!

429
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,793
Wait, wait, you have something...

430
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:04,562
I'll get that.

431
00:30:05,336 --> 00:30:06,200
Better?
Yeah.

432
00:30:13,611 --> 00:30:15,772
Get it?
I got it.

433
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:23,181
One day, Neal and I were
thrown together in bed, at 4 am

434
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:24,549
By circumstance...

435
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:27,317
with no place else to go
and no place else to sleep.

436
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:31,087
And I remember
being a little scared,

437
00:30:31,696 --> 00:30:34,062
and not quite sure
what to do, so...

438
00:30:34,632 --> 00:30:37,760
I sort of like turned over and

439
00:30:37,902 --> 00:30:40,871
stiffened my body
and got on the edge of the bed.

440
00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:44,041
And he saw that I was shy.

441
00:30:45,076 --> 00:30:46,839
At the time I was still...

442
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:50,573
scared of feeling
with another person.

443
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,483
So he put his arm around me,

444
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:59,215
and pulled me, and

445
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:02,687
put my head on his breast, and

446
00:31:02,827 --> 00:31:05,091
gave me love, actually.

447
00:31:38,129 --> 00:31:40,120
And then one day,
I got a letter

448
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:42,165
saying, finally,

449
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,598
"We shouldn't consider
ourselves lovers...

450
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,102
"I'm distracted with the wife,

451
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:50,233
"as much as I love you."

452
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:54,443
So my heart was broken.

453
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:01,476
"Dear Allen,

454
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:04,621
"What you say is honestly
what I've been doing

455
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:07,281
"or striving for all my life.

456
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:09,256
"Therein lies our,

457
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:12,158
"or my confused sense
of closeness.

458
00:32:12,463 --> 00:32:16,331
"Also I fear therein lies our
strength of tie to each other.

459
00:32:16,467 --> 00:32:17,559
"I say, 'I fear,'

460
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:21,399
"for I really don't know how much
I can be satisfied to love you.

461
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:22,665
"I mean 'bodily.'

462
00:32:22,807 --> 00:32:26,265
"You know, I sometimes dislike
pricks and men and before you

463
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:29,710
"had consciously forced myself
to be homosexual.

464
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:32,411
"You meant so much to me.

465
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,984
"I now feel I was forcing
a desire for you bodily

466
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,815
"as a compensation to you

467
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:39,784
"for all you were giving me.

468
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:41,785
"Allen, this is straight.

469
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:45,655
"What I truly want is to live
with you from September to June,

470
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:49,028
"have an apartment,
a girl, go to college,

471
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:50,828
"see all and do all,

472
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:54,336
"and become truly straight,
so please, Allen,

473
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:56,838
"give this
a good deal of thought."

474
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:11,312
<i>Who drove cross country 72 hours</i>

I think it's a howl of pain.

500
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:40,202
Figuratively speaking,
his toes have been stepped on.

501
00:34:40,344 --> 00:34:43,370
He's poetically putting
his cry of pain and

502
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:45,141
protest into this book, "Howl."

503
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:48,480
And do you think this book
has definite literary value?

504
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:49,617
I do.

505
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:52,048
As a matter of fact,
I think in a way

506
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:55,216
he is employing
the jazz phraseology here

507
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,452
and, may I say, I...

508
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:02,726
I think he's also employing
the words he heard

509
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:06,303
in his life on the road
and in his various experiences.

510
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:08,497
Thank you.

511
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:12,234
Now, do you understand
most of the words in this book?

512
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,671
I think
I understand their significance

513
00:35:14,812 --> 00:35:16,677
and the general context of it.

514
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:18,072
I see.

515
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:23,884
Taking on page 13,

516
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:25,079
the 14th line:

517
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:29,059
"Who howled on their knees
in the subway

518
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:34,221
"and were dragged off the roof
waving genitals and manuscripts."

519
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:37,693
Now, do you understand what
that paragraph is trying to say,

520
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:40,395
as a part of the "Howl"?

521
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:42,104
Not explicitly.

522
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:46,272
I would say
he was attempting to show the...

523
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:49,641
lack of inhibition
in the persons he's talking of,

524
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:53,206
post World War II generation...

525
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,180
those who returned,

526
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,222
went into college or went into
work immediately after WW II

527
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:05,522
perhaps were somewhat displaced
by the chaos of the war and

528
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,858
didn't immediately settle down.

529
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:11,527
Now, the next paragraph:

530
00:36:16,073 --> 00:36:19,270
"Who blew and were blown

531
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:23,278
"by those human seraphim,
the sailors,

532
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:27,145
"caresses of Atlantic
and Caribbean love."

533
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:31,187
Now, you understand what
"blew" and "blown" mean?

534
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:34,088
Well, I think they are words
that have several meanings.

535
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:37,890
What meanings do you attribute
to the words in this paragraph?

536
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:41,294
it can at one level mean...
that they were vagabonds,

537
00:36:41,432 --> 00:36:45,835
that they were being blown about
by natural, literal winds.

538
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:49,098
On the other hand, perhaps it
does have a sexual connotation.

539
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:52,937
in reference
to oral copulation, right?

540
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:54,506
Yes, possibly.

541
00:36:54,845 --> 00:36:56,540
Now then, do you find
that those words

542
00:36:56,681 --> 00:36:58,444
are necessary to the context

543
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:00,312
to make it a work
of literary value?

544
00:37:00,451 --> 00:37:02,146
I thought we had settled this,
Your Honor.

545
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:04,811
Yes, Mr. McIntosh,
if you will recall,

546
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:08,119
I said that I would not allow
the use of the word "necessary."

547
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,959
But you may ask the question,
"Are they relevant?"

548
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:15,191
Are they relevant to make
this a work of literary value?

549
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:16,857
Yes, I would say so.

550
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:19,663
Now then if you took
those words out of there,

551
00:37:20,037 --> 00:37:21,834
Would that spoil the portrayal?

552
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:24,942
That's doing indirectly what Your Honor
won't permit him to do directly.

553
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:27,135
This man is an expert.

554
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:28,878
He has to speculate.

555
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:33,382
No, Mr. McIntosh, I'm afraid
I can't go along with you on that.

556
00:37:33,517 --> 00:37:37,248
Whether the author might
have used other or different words,

557
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:40,016
you're getting into
the realm of speculation there.

558
00:37:40,157 --> 00:37:41,647
Objection sustained.

559
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:44,520
Going down a little further...

560
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:51,327
"who sweetened the snatches
of a million girls

561
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:55,428
"trembling in the sunset,
and were red eyed in the morning

562
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:59,532
"but prepared to sweeten
the snatch of the sunrise,

563
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:04,410
"flashing buttocks under barns
and naked in the lake."

564
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:10,180
What's your question?

565
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:13,216
is that word "snatches"
in there...

566
00:38:13,357 --> 00:38:14,756
is that...

567
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:18,157
relevant to Mr. Ginsberg's
literary endeavor?

568
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:22,699
Yes. I think to use euphemisms
in describing this would...

569
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:26,369
seem dishonest to Mr. Ginsberg.

570
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:30,598
You also said, I believe,
literary value sometimes

571
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:34,404
is a book which will survive
any test of time.

572
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:37,309
Do you think Mr. Ginsberg's work
will survive the test of time?

573
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:39,439
He has no way of knowing,

574
00:38:39,583 --> 00:38:42,450
no more than some people thought
"Leaves of Grass" would survive.

575
00:38:42,586 --> 00:38:45,419
I'm asking him for his opinion,
to give us an opinion on that book.

576
00:38:45,556 --> 00:38:47,490
He says that literary value

577
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:49,559
depends on surviving
the test of time.

578
00:38:49,694 --> 00:38:50,922
I want to know if it will.

579
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:52,461
If Luther Nichols
could answer that,

580
00:38:52,596 --> 00:38:55,531
then the Good Lord could use a
helper and he ought to be up there.

581
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:56,598
How can he tell?

582
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:59,168
I'm asking
for his opinion as an expert.

583
00:38:59,303 --> 00:39:00,099
I'll ask him.

584
00:39:01,205 --> 00:39:03,196
Can you answer the question?

585
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:07,608
it calls for a prediction.

586
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,876
I think that this trial
will draw attention to it.

587
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:15,713
"Howl" will have a wider readership
than it might otherwise have had,

588
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:19,755
and may go down in history as
a stepping stone along the way

589
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:21,949
to greater or lesser liberality

590
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:23,822
in the permitting
of poems of its type.

591
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:41,309
Poetry, generally, is a...

592
00:39:41,445 --> 00:39:44,141
rhythmic articulation of feeling

593
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:47,174
And the feeling is

594
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:50,048
an impulse that begins inside.

595
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:54,655
Like a sexual impulse, you know.
Almost as definite as that. it's

596
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:58,926
it's a feeling that begins, in
the pit of the stomach, right?

597
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:03,566
And rises up
through the breast, and...

598
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:06,431
out the mouth and ears, right?

599
00:40:08,038 --> 00:40:09,005
And...

600
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:12,871
it comes forth as a croon
or a groan or a sigh, right?

601
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:15,508
So if you try
to put words to that

602
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:18,171
by looking around you and

603
00:40:18,315 --> 00:40:21,307
trying to describe
what's making you sigh,

604
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:23,147
just sigh in words,

605
00:40:23,854 --> 00:40:26,152
you simply articulate
what you're feeling.

606
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:29,887
<i>Who bit detectives in the neck</i>
<i>and shrieked with delight</i>

607
00:40:30,027 --> 00:40:32,962
<i>in police cars</i>
<i>for committing no crime,</i>

608
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:37,227
<i>but their own wild cooking</i>
<i>pederasty and intoxication.</i>

609
00:40:38,202 --> 00:40:41,694
<i>Who howled</i>
<i>on their knees in the subway</i>

610
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:44,137
<i>and were dragged off the roof</i>

611
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:48,075
<i>waving genitals and manuscripts.</i>

612
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:54,913
in the moment of composition,

613
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:57,450
I don't necessarily
know what it means.

614
00:40:58,322 --> 00:41:00,119
it comes to mean
something later,

615
00:41:00,257 --> 00:41:01,849
after a year or two,
I come to realize

616
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:03,152
it meant something clear,

617
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,625
unconsciously.

618
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:08,058
Which takes on meaning in time,
you know like...

619
00:41:08,365 --> 00:41:10,094
a photograph developing slowly.

620
00:41:12,169 --> 00:41:13,966
If it's at all spontaneous,

621
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:18,204
I don't know whether it even
makes sense sometimes.

622
00:41:18,676 --> 00:41:21,975
And other times, I do know
it makes complete sense,

623
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:25,110
I start crying.

624
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:28,179
'Cause I realize that I'm...

625
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,613
I'm hitting on an area that's...

626
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:33,455
absolutely true.

627
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:37,385
in that sense, able to be
read by someone

628
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:40,554
and wept to,
maybe, centuries later.

629
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:43,263
in that sense, prophecy,

630
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:46,533
because it touches a common key.

631
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:48,035
I mean,

632
00:41:49,206 --> 00:41:51,436
what prophecy actually is,

633
00:41:51,976 --> 00:41:55,412
is not knowing whether...

634
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:57,981
the bomb will fall in 1942.

635
00:41:58,415 --> 00:42:00,975
it's knowing
and feeling something

636
00:42:01,118 --> 00:42:03,143
which someone knows and feels

637
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:05,751
in a hundred years. Hmm?

638
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:10,549
And maybe articulating it
in a hint that

639
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:13,356
they will pick up on
in a 100 years.

640
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:35,377
<i>Who crashed through</i>
<i>their minds in jail</i>

00:45:17,081 --> 00:45:18,070
After I left New York,

684
00:45:18,615 --> 00:45:20,776
I spent a year in San Francisco.

685
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:24,248
I had an apartment on Nob Hill,

686
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:27,621
the tie and suit,

687
00:45:27,758 --> 00:45:30,852
a job with several
secretaries which was...

688
00:45:30,994 --> 00:45:32,586
beginning to give me pleasure,

689
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:35,455
the pleasure
of knowing I could do it

690
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:38,591
and was no longer intimidated
by the social forms,

691
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:42,172
to be able to make it
in the very dry, business world

692
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:46,102
And that's when I met Peter.

693
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:17,870
it was when I met Peter

694
00:46:18,008 --> 00:46:20,067
that everything changed for me.

695
00:46:23,514 --> 00:46:26,745
it was as if the heavens
showered with gold.

696
00:46:28,085 --> 00:46:32,579
Finally somebody loved me
like I loved them,

697
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:37,084
and for the first time,
I felt accepted in my life.

698
00:46:37,227 --> 00:46:38,626
Completely.

699
00:46:48,872 --> 00:46:50,305
in San Francisco,

700
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,637
I had a year of psychotherapy
with Dr. Hicks.

701
00:46:55,045 --> 00:46:57,206
I was blocked,
I couldn't write...

702
00:46:58,415 --> 00:47:00,246
I was still trying
to act normal.

703
00:47:00,384 --> 00:47:02,375
I was afraid I was crazy.

704
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:05,386
I was sure that I was
supposed to be heterosexual

705
00:47:05,522 --> 00:47:07,854
and that something
was wrong with me.

706
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,019
And Dr. Hicks kept saying,

707
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:14,426
"What do you want to do?

708
00:47:14,565 --> 00:47:17,557
"What is your heart's desire?"

709
00:47:17,701 --> 00:47:19,828
Finally I said...

710
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:22,131
what I'd really like to do is to

711
00:47:22,272 --> 00:47:24,536
just quit all this

712
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:25,571
and...

713
00:47:25,709 --> 00:47:27,574
get a small room with Peter

714
00:47:27,711 --> 00:47:30,305
and devote myself
to my writing and

715
00:47:30,747 --> 00:47:34,615
contemplation and fucking
and smoking pot and...

716
00:47:34,751 --> 00:47:36,742
doing whatever I want.

717
00:47:37,788 --> 00:47:40,552
And he said,
"Why don't you do it, then?"

718
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:46,427
I mean, what will happen
if I grow old...

719
00:47:46,563 --> 00:47:48,531
and I have pee stains
in my underwear

720
00:47:48,665 --> 00:47:51,031
and I'm living
in some furnished room

721
00:47:51,168 --> 00:47:53,193
and nobody loves me and I'm...

722
00:47:53,337 --> 00:47:54,634
white haired and...

723
00:47:54,771 --> 00:47:57,205
I have no money, bread crumbs
are falling on the floor?"

724
00:47:57,341 --> 00:47:58,740
And he said,

725
00:47:59,843 --> 00:48:01,401
"Don't worry about that,

726
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:05,504
"you're very charming and lovable
and people will always love you."

727
00:48:05,649 --> 00:48:07,879
What a relief to hear that!

728
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:11,543
I very soon realized that
it was all...

729
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:13,317
a fear trap...

730
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:15,922
Illusory!

731
00:48:18,762 --> 00:48:21,788
<i>What sphinx</i>
<i>of cement and aluminum</i>

732
00:48:21,932 --> 00:48:24,298
<i>bashed open their skulls</i>

733
00:48:24,434 --> 00:48:27,301
<i>and ate up</i>
<i>their brains and imagination?</i>

734
00:48:27,938 --> 00:48:32,432
<i>Moloch! Solitude! Filth!</i>

735
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:36,774
<i>Ugliness! Ashcans and</i>
<i>unobtalnable dollarsl</i>

736
00:48:37,381 --> 00:48:40,077
<i>Children screaming</i>
<i>under stairways!</i>

737
00:48:40,217 --> 00:48:42,708
<i>Boys sobbing in armies!</i>

738
00:48:42,853 --> 00:48:45,481
<i>Old men weeping in the parks!</i>

739
00:48:45,622 --> 00:48:48,386
<i>Moloch! Moloch!</i>

740
00:48:48,525 --> 00:48:53,087
<i>Nightmare of Moloch!</i>
<i>Moloch the loveless!</i>

741
00:48:53,563 --> 00:48:55,394
<i>Mental Moloch!</i>

742
00:48:55,532 --> 00:48:59,127
<i>Moloch the heavy judger of men!</i>

743
00:49:02,506 --> 00:49:05,839
Peter and I saw Moloch one day
when we took peyote

744
00:49:05,976 --> 00:49:08,877
and were wandering around
downtown streets.

745
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:13,071
it's a god that you make
fire sacrifices to.

746
00:49:13,717 --> 00:49:14,615
But...

747
00:49:14,985 --> 00:49:18,716
in my mind, it was what
drove my mother to madness.

748
00:49:20,157 --> 00:49:22,648
So, I had the line

749
00:49:22,993 --> 00:49:27,259
Moloch whose eyes are
a thousand blind windows.

750
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:29,155
I had this word,

751
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:33,334
And... I also had the feeling

752
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:35,904
<i>DA de de DA de de DA</i>
<i>de de DA DA.</i> Hmm?

753
00:49:36,039 --> 00:49:40,976
So then all I had to do was look
up and see a lot of windows,

754
00:49:41,111 --> 00:49:43,136
and say,
"Oh, windows, of course,"

755
00:49:43,413 --> 00:49:45,847
But what kind of windows? Right?
And...

756
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,848
Not only that...

757
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:50,283
"Moloch whose eyes"...Right?

758
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:53,583
"Moloch whose eyes" which
is beautiful in itself but...

759
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:55,655
You know, what about it?

760
00:49:55,792 --> 00:49:56,884
"Moloch whose eyes" what?

761
00:49:57,027 --> 00:49:59,188
"Moloch whose eyes"...

762
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:02,457
Then the next thing
I thought was probably...

763
00:50:02,599 --> 00:50:03,156
"Thousands."

764
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:04,961
OK, but "thousands" what?

765
00:50:05,102 --> 00:50:06,729
"Thousands blind"...

766
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:09,805
And then I had to
finish it somehow. So...

767
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:11,237
I had to say "windows."

768
00:50:16,913 --> 00:50:21,782
<i>Moloch whose eyes are</i>
<i>a thousand blind windows!</i>

769
00:50:23,987 --> 00:50:26,080
<i>Moloch whose skyscrapers</i>

770
00:50:26,223 --> 00:50:29,715
<i>stand in the long streets</i>
<i>Like endless Jehovahs!</i>

771
00:50:31,395 --> 00:50:35,456
<i>Moloch whose factories</i>
<i>dream and croak in the fog!</i>

772
00:50:38,268 --> 00:50:42,364
<i>Moloch whose love</i>
<i>is endless oil and stone!</i>

773
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:47,574
<i>Moloch whose soul</i>
<i>is electricity and banks!</i>

774
00:50:48,345 --> 00:50:53,044
<i>Moloch whose fate is a cloud</i>
<i>of sexless hydrogen!</i>

775
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:57,581
<i>Moloch in whom I sit lonely!</i>

776
00:50:58,522 --> 00:51:01,923
<i>Moloch in whom I dream Angels!</i>

777
00:51:04,294 --> 00:51:06,057
<i>Crazy in Moloch!</i>

778
00:51:06,363 --> 00:51:08,490
<i>Cocksucker in Moloch!</i>

779
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:12,226
<i>Lacklove and manless in Moloch!</i>

780
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:16,330
<i>Moloch who entered</i>
<i>my soul early!</i>

781
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:21,476
<i>Moloch who frightened me</i>
<i>out of my natural ecstasy!</i>

782
00:51:22,045 --> 00:51:24,104
<i>Moloch whom I abandon!</i>

783
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:26,840
<i>Wake up in Moloch!</i>

784
00:51:27,217 --> 00:51:29,947
<i>Light streaming out of the sky!</i>

785
00:51:32,122 --> 00:51:34,056
<i>Moloch! Moloch!</i>

786
00:51:34,191 --> 00:51:35,681
<i>Robot apartments!</i>

<i>Real holy laughter in the river!</i>

<i>They saw it all!</i>

00:52:42,926 --> 00:52:46,157
<i>The wild eyes! The holy yells!</i>

816
00:52:46,296 --> 00:52:47,888
<i>They bade farewell!</i>

817
00:52:48,031 --> 00:52:51,159
<i>They jumped off the roof!</i>
<i>To solitude!</i>

<i>Down to the river!</i>

821
00:52:56,806 --> 00:52:58,171
<i>Into the street!</i>

822
00:52:59,743 --> 00:53:02,769
it is my opinion that if it has
any literary value,

823
00:53:02,913 --> 00:53:04,676
it's negligible.

824
00:53:04,814 --> 00:53:07,510
I endeavored to arrive
at my opinion

825
00:53:07,651 --> 00:53:08,811
on an objective basis.

826
00:53:08,952 --> 00:53:09,884
For example,

827
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:14,184
a great literary work, or even
a fairly great literary work,

828
00:53:14,324 --> 00:53:17,760
would obviously be
exceedingly successful in form,

829
00:53:18,228 --> 00:53:20,788
but this poem is really
just a weak imitation

830
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:24,264
of a form that was used 80
to 90 years ago by Walt Whitman.

831
00:53:24,401 --> 00:53:26,926
And do you recall
the name of that poem?

832
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:30,130
"Leaves of Grass" was
the name of the poem.

833
00:53:30,273 --> 00:53:32,833
Literary value
could also reside in theme,

834
00:53:33,777 --> 00:53:36,405
and what little literary value
there is in "Howl,"

835
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:38,070
it seems to me
does come in theme.

836
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:42,207
The statement of the idea of
the poem was relatively clear,

837
00:53:42,352 --> 00:53:45,344
but it has little validity,
and, therefore, the theme

838
00:53:45,488 --> 00:53:46,955
has a negative value.

839
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:48,216
No value at all.

840
00:53:48,358 --> 00:53:49,382
Thank you.

841
00:53:50,794 --> 00:53:52,762
Did I understand you to say that

842
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:55,797
Ginsberg used
Walt Whitman's style?

843
00:53:55,932 --> 00:53:56,864
The form.

844
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,298
The form of the book
"Leaves of Grass."

845
00:53:59,436 --> 00:54:01,768
And because of
Ginsberg's using this format,

846
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:04,339
it is your opinion
that the poem "Howl"

847
00:54:04,474 --> 00:54:06,305
has no literary value or...

848
00:54:06,443 --> 00:54:08,070
merit, is that true?

849
00:54:08,345 --> 00:54:10,404
On the basis of form,
that's correct,

850
00:54:10,547 --> 00:54:12,947
because great literature
always creates

851
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:15,210
its own form for
each significant occasion.

852
00:54:15,352 --> 00:54:17,582
By that, you do not mean that

853
00:54:17,721 --> 00:54:20,622
Walt Whitman's "Leaves of Grass"
doesn't quite qualify?

854
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:22,782
That is great literature.

855
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:25,087
The form was created
by Walt Whitman.

856
00:54:25,228 --> 00:54:26,957
And at the same time,
you say, because

857
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:29,065
Ginsberg copied that format,

858
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:32,396
"Howl" has no
value or merit, am I correct?

859
00:54:32,535 --> 00:54:33,559
That is correct.

860
00:54:33,703 --> 00:54:37,002
An imitation never does
have the value of the original.

861
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:38,767
Who did Walt Whitman copy?

862
00:54:39,376 --> 00:54:41,139
To my knowledge, no one.

863
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:42,433
But you don't know,

864
00:54:42,579 --> 00:54:45,070
isn't that your answer,
you don't know, sir?

865
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:47,675
That's right.

866
00:54:48,018 --> 00:54:49,713
As I understand,
your next signpost

867
00:54:49,853 --> 00:54:51,377
is that the idea

868
00:54:51,521 --> 00:54:54,251
of "Howl" is clear,
but has little validity.

869
00:54:54,391 --> 00:54:56,154
Am I quoting you correctly?

870
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:58,651
That's the general conclusion,
yes...

871
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:00,854
the idea of "Howl"
is clear in theme.

872
00:55:00,997 --> 00:55:02,259
The idea is clear?
Yes.

873
00:55:03,533 --> 00:55:06,058
What idea
does Ginsberg have in "Howl"?

874
00:55:06,202 --> 00:55:09,660
Well, he celebrates
the unfortunate life of...

875
00:55:11,941 --> 00:55:13,670
I can't remember the man's name,
Solomon...

876
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:16,370
the unfortunate life
of the man, Solomon,

877
00:55:16,513 --> 00:55:18,981
who is a drifter
of Dadaist persuasion.

878
00:55:19,616 --> 00:55:20,674
A drift what?

879
00:55:21,084 --> 00:55:23,109
Drifter of Dadaist persuasion.

880
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:25,380
He portrays that?

881
00:55:25,722 --> 00:55:27,019
That's correct.

882
00:55:27,357 --> 00:55:29,951
And does that portrayal
have any validity?

883
00:55:30,093 --> 00:55:32,220
Not as literature, no.

884
00:55:32,529 --> 00:55:34,121
<i>Carl Solomon!</i>

885
00:55:34,698 --> 00:55:38,930

00:55:45,608 --> 00:55:50,272

00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:52,205
<i>I'm with you in Rockland</i>

00:56:52,342 --> 00:56:54,742

<i>O vlctory</i>

00:57:27,677 --> 00:57:29,975
<i>I'm with you in Rockland</i>

00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:31,637
<i>in my dreams</i>

920
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:34,511
<i>you walk dripping</i>

921

922

<i>in tears to the door</i>
<i>of my cottage</i>

923
00:57:40,657 --> 00:57:42,454
<i>in the Western night.</i>

924
00:57:45,261 --> 00:57:50,164
What is your impression
of the third portion of "Howl"?

925
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:53,326
My understanding there would be
that the poet expresses

926
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,563
the usual Dadaist line that

927
00:57:55,705 --> 00:57:58,572
everything is created
for man's despair,

928
00:57:58,708 --> 00:58:01,575
that everything must be
forgotten and destroyed, and

929
00:58:01,711 --> 00:58:04,271
that Solomon's life apparently
has had this kind of rhythm.

930
00:58:04,414 --> 00:58:06,314
Therefore,
there is some validity

931
00:58:06,449 --> 00:58:08,849
of theme, in that area.

932
00:58:09,118 --> 00:58:11,177
So, there is
validity of theme there?

933
00:58:12,222 --> 00:58:15,851
I am afraid I got my tongue
tripped up there... this...

934
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:18,483
I should have said "clarity"
instead of "validity."

935
00:58:18,628 --> 00:58:20,892
But you've been using
the term "validity"

936
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:23,021
the entire time
you've been on the stand.

937
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:25,895
By the way, Mr. Kirk,
have you read the Holy Bible?

938
00:58:26,803 --> 00:58:27,963
I have.

939
00:58:28,538 --> 00:58:30,165
Tell me, did you read Job?

940
00:58:30,306 --> 00:58:31,330
I have.

941
00:58:31,908 --> 00:58:35,036
Isn't Job crying the same cry
as Ginsberg's "Howl"?

942
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:36,406
Not at all.

943
00:58:36,546 --> 00:58:40,312
Do you agree with me
that Job does condemn life?

944
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:43,778
Job condemns
man's condition, yes,

945
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:47,481
but he does not go on then,
as the Dadaist goes on, to...

946
00:58:47,624 --> 00:58:49,489
desire to wipe out
all human memory

947
00:58:49,626 --> 00:58:51,389
of everything the human race
has ever done

948
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:54,361
so that there can be
a fresh start made

949
00:58:54,497 --> 00:58:55,930
as the Dadaist does.

950
00:58:56,065 --> 00:58:57,396
And you don't believe
in that philosophy?

951
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:57,966
Not at all.

952
00:58:58,234 --> 00:59:01,465
No, it's been dead
since about 1922 or '23.

953
00:59:01,604 --> 00:59:03,094
But that doesn't
necessarily mean that

954
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:05,036
someone who does
believe that is...

955
00:59:05,275 --> 00:59:06,105
wrong, does it?

956
00:59:06,242 --> 00:59:09,109
No, but that does not
create literature.

957
00:59:09,245 --> 00:59:10,542
Well, what...

958
00:59:11,281 --> 00:59:13,112
What creates
literature, Mr. Kirk?

959
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:16,546
I'd have to return to my three
bases of objective criticism:

960
00:59:16,686 --> 00:59:18,745
Form, theme and opportunity.

961
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:19,946
Well...

962
00:59:20,089 --> 00:59:22,580
Do you feel that
Ginsberg had the

963
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:24,625
opportunity in his travels

964
00:59:24,761 --> 00:59:26,558
to observe life
and to write about it?

965
00:59:26,696 --> 00:59:28,391
A small segment, yes.

966
00:59:28,531 --> 00:59:30,226
And this is the segment that
he's writing about,

967
00:59:30,366 --> 00:59:31,060
isn't that right?

968
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,167
One thing...

969
00:59:32,302 --> 00:59:34,896
Answer that question,
please, "Yes" or "No."

970
00:59:35,805 --> 00:59:39,297
Uh... I'm... I'm confused.

971
00:59:40,276 --> 00:59:42,437
This is the segment that
he is writing about,

972
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:43,238
isn't that true?

973
00:59:43,379 --> 00:59:45,313
I can't answer that
either "Yes" or "No."

974
00:59:45,448 --> 00:59:47,075
But you said in his travels,

975
00:59:47,216 --> 00:59:49,309
he wrote about a small segment
of the community.

976
00:59:49,852 --> 00:59:51,581
Here's where
the confusion comes in:

977
00:59:51,721 --> 00:59:54,713
I believe the travels
are Solomon's, not Ginsberg's.

978
00:59:54,857 --> 00:59:56,381
That's the basis
of my confusion.

979
00:59:56,659 --> 00:59:59,423
Yes, well, Ginsberg is writing
it about Solomon...

980
00:59:59,562 --> 01:00:01,189
it's his own observations.

981
01:00:01,331 --> 01:00:02,389
You have read that, haven't you?

982
01:00:02,732 --> 01:00:04,723
I am unable to know
whether he has

983
01:00:04,867 --> 01:00:06,357
an acquaintance with Solomon.

984
01:00:06,502 --> 01:00:08,936
That is the thing that is
beyond my experience,

985
01:00:09,072 --> 01:00:10,369
beyond my knowledge.

986
01:00:10,506 --> 01:00:13,168
Do you evaluate a work
by whether the writer knew

987
01:00:13,309 --> 01:00:14,469
the person he was talking about?

988
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:16,108
Absolutely.

989
01:00:16,245 --> 01:00:19,271
Are you certain that
Carl Solomon ever lived?

990
01:00:19,415 --> 01:00:20,040
No.

991
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:21,914
Then you don't know, do you?

992
01:00:22,385 --> 01:00:22,908
Not at all.

993
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:26,888
Have you ever read... Voltaire?

994
01:00:27,857 --> 01:00:28,789
I've read one work,

995
01:00:29,092 --> 01:00:29,820
"Candide."

996
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:31,517
And what is your opinion
of "Candide"?

997
01:00:31,661 --> 01:00:34,061
As literature?
it's great literature.

998
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:36,491
And whose style
did Voltaire copy?

999
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:37,258
Oh!

1000
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:37,991
Your Honor!

1001
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:38,623
Please!

1002
01:00:38,901 --> 01:00:40,698
Counsel is allowed
to make an objection.

1003
01:00:40,837 --> 01:00:42,361
If he objects.

1004
01:00:42,939 --> 01:00:44,998
Well, I would like to...

1005
01:00:46,576 --> 01:00:49,010
I don't want to box with him.

1006
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:50,840
He's disturbing me.

1007
01:00:51,748 --> 01:00:54,615
I get my mouth open
and out fly fists.

1008
01:01:01,557 --> 01:01:04,526
How long have you
reflected on "Howl"?

1009
01:01:05,695 --> 01:01:06,957
I believe two weeks.

1010
01:01:07,096 --> 01:01:08,154
Two weeks?

1011
01:01:08,297 --> 01:01:10,390
Two weeks would be
the limit of my opportunity.

1012
01:01:10,533 --> 01:01:12,831
However, I made my mind up
after 5 minutes.

1013
01:01:12,969 --> 01:01:15,267
And you reflected
a long, long time

1014
01:01:15,405 --> 01:01:17,305
on Voltaire's "Candide,"
is that right?

1015
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:18,532
Exactly.

1016
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:20,734
Well, do you think that
if you had another

1017
01:01:20,877 --> 01:01:22,674
ten years to reflect on "Howl,"

1018
01:01:22,812 --> 01:01:24,507
you might change your opinion?

1019
01:01:24,647 --> 01:01:26,911
I am quite certain I would not.

1020
01:01:29,652 --> 01:01:30,641
That is all.

1021
01:01:32,321 --> 01:01:34,653
<i>... where you accuse</i>
<i>your doctors of insanity</i>

1022
01:01:34,791 --> 01:01:37,191

01:02:10,126 --> 01:02:13,562
<i>that coughs all night</i>
<i>and won't let us sleep.</i>

1035
01:02:14,363 --> 01:02:15,796
<i>I'm with you in Rockland</i>

1036
01:02:16,466 --> 01:02:20,095
<i>where we wake up electrified</i>
<i>out of the coma</i>

1037
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:23,865

01:02:28,044 --> 01:02:30,877

01:02:31,013 --> 01:02:34,380
<i>imaginary walls collapse</i>

1041
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:38,347
<i>O skinny legions run outside</i>

1042
01:02:38,621 --> 01:02:41,818
<i>O starry spangled shock of mercy</i>

1043
01:02:41,958 --> 01:02:44,620
<i>the eternal war is here!</i>

1044
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:46,388
<i>O vlctoryl</i>

1045
01:02:46,729 --> 01:02:48,424
<i>Forget your underwear!</i>

1046
01:02:48,564 --> 01:02:50,031
<i>We're free!</i>

1047
01:02:51,067 --> 01:02:53,399
<i>I'm with you in Rockland</i>

1048
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:55,699
<i>in my dreams</i>

1049
01:02:55,838 --> 01:02:58,398
<i>you walk dripping</i>
<i>from a sea journey</i>

1050
01:02:58,541 --> 01:03:00,839
<i>on the highway across America</i>

1051
01:03:00,977 --> 01:03:04,970
<i>in tears to the door</i>
<i>of my cottage</i>

1052
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:07,173
<i>in the Western night.</i>

1053
01:03:18,261 --> 01:03:20,354
"Howl" contains words,

1054
01:03:20,496 --> 01:03:22,987
taken just by themselves,
Your Honor,

1055
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:25,396
that are definitely obscene.

1056
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:28,695
And we have had different
literary experts testify that

1057
01:03:28,838 --> 01:03:32,672
the books have literary merit,
and that the words

1058
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:35,505
are necessary to that
so called merit.

1059
01:03:37,446 --> 01:03:40,210
But it's funny in our law,

1060
01:03:40,349 --> 01:03:41,907
we are allowed to use

1061
01:03:42,051 --> 01:03:44,747
expert witnesses
to testify as to literary merit,

1062
01:03:44,887 --> 01:03:47,515
but we are not allowed
to bring in,

1063
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:49,887
we will say, the average man

1064
01:03:50,026 --> 01:03:52,551
to testify that when
he reads the book,

1065
01:03:52,695 --> 01:03:54,287
he doesn't understand it.

1066
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:57,024
He doesn't know
what it's all about.

1067
01:03:57,633 --> 01:03:59,692
Perhaps it's over his head.

1068
01:04:00,236 --> 01:04:02,363
Take, for example...

1069
01:04:04,574 --> 01:04:08,408
Frankly, and I made the comment
in open court that I'd read it,

1070
01:04:09,245 --> 01:04:11,304
I don't understand it very well.

1071
01:04:11,447 --> 01:04:13,677
in fact, looking it all over,

1072
01:04:13,816 --> 01:04:16,546
I think it's a lot of
sensitive bullshit,

1073
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:19,052
using the language
of Mr. Ginsberg.

1074
01:04:20,089 --> 01:04:20,748
So then,

1075
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:24,982
If the sale of a book
is not being limited to just

1076
01:04:25,127 --> 01:04:26,458
modern book reviewers

1077
01:04:26,596 --> 01:04:28,530
and experts on modern poetry,

1078
01:04:28,664 --> 01:04:30,996
but falls into the hands
of the general public,

1079
01:04:31,133 --> 01:04:33,829
that is to say,
the average reader,

1080
01:04:34,837 --> 01:04:36,964
this court should take that
into consideration

1081
01:04:37,106 --> 01:04:40,269
in determining whether or not
"Howl" is obscene.

1082
01:04:40,977 --> 01:04:42,444
Thank you, Your Honor

1083
01:04:43,913 --> 01:04:44,709
Alright...

1084
01:04:44,847 --> 01:04:46,337
I will hear from the defense.

1085
01:04:52,188 --> 01:04:55,851
The United States Supreme Court
has said that obscenity

1086
01:04:56,792 --> 01:04:58,350
is construed to mean

1087
01:04:58,995 --> 01:05:01,862
"having a
substantial tendency to corrupt

1088
01:05:01,998 --> 01:05:04,592
"by arousing lustful desires."

1089
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:11,538
is the word relevant to what
the author is trying to say,

1090
01:05:12,074 --> 01:05:15,305
or did he just use it
to be dirty and filthy?

1091
01:05:15,945 --> 01:05:19,244
He sees what he terms as

1092
01:05:19,715 --> 01:05:22,809
"an Adonis of Denver,
joy to the memory

1093
01:05:22,952 --> 01:05:25,386
"of his innumerable conquests.

1094
01:05:25,521 --> 01:05:28,183
<i>Who went out</i>
<i>whoring through Colorado</i>

1095
01:05:28,324 --> 01:05:31,350
<i>in myriad stolen night cars</i>

1096
01:05:31,494 --> 01:05:36,397
<i>Neal Cassady,</i>
<i>secret hero of this poem,</i>

1097
01:05:36,532 --> 01:05:39,160
<i>cocksman and Adonis of Denver,</i>

1098
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:43,902
<i>joy to the memory</i>
<i>of his Innumerable lays of girls</i>

1099
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:47,476
<i>in empty lots</i>
<i>and diner backyards,</i>

1100
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:50,204
<i>moviehouses' rickety rows,</i>

1101
01:05:50,346 --> 01:05:55,215
<i>on mountaintops in caves</i>
<i>or with gaunt waitresses</i>

1102
01:05:55,351 --> 01:05:59,754
<i>in familiar roadside</i>
<i>lonely petticoat upliftings</i>

1103
01:05:59,889 --> 01:06:05,020
<i>and especially secret</i>
<i>gas station solipsisms of johns,</i>

1104
01:06:05,161 --> 01:06:07,391
<i>and hometown alleys too.</i>

1105
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:10,857
Now, I suppose
he could have said that,

1106
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,093
the secret hero of these poems,

1107
01:06:13,235 --> 01:06:16,693
this "cocksman,"
this "Adonis of Denver,"

1108
01:06:16,839 --> 01:06:20,468
joy to memory
of his innumerable conquests

1109
01:06:20,609 --> 01:06:21,906
at the Waldorf Astoria...

1110
01:06:22,745 --> 01:06:25,339
or at dinner at Chasen's,
or after one or two drinks,

1111
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:27,813
in going to bed
at the Stork Club.

1112
01:06:28,617 --> 01:06:30,710
I presume
he could have said that...

1113
01:06:30,853 --> 01:06:32,753
but that isn't
the kind of person

1114
01:06:32,888 --> 01:06:34,719
he is writing about.

1115
01:06:35,191 --> 01:06:37,751
it is not for us
to choose the words.

1116
01:06:38,361 --> 01:06:40,591
Mr. Ginsberg,
in telling his story,

1117
01:06:40,730 --> 01:06:42,493
is telling the story
as he sees it.

1118
01:06:42,631 --> 01:06:44,394
He is using his words.

1119
01:06:45,067 --> 01:06:47,058
There are books that
have the power to change

1120
01:06:47,203 --> 01:06:48,568
men's minds,

1121
01:06:48,904 --> 01:06:51,304
and call attention
to situations that...

1122
01:06:51,774 --> 01:06:52,832
are visible but

1123
01:06:53,175 --> 01:06:54,005
unseen.

1124
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:58,674
Now whether "Howl" is
or is not "obscene" is of

1125
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:02,514
little importance to our world,
faced as it is with the threat

1126
01:07:02,651 --> 01:07:04,380
of physical survival,

1127
01:07:05,254 --> 01:07:05,913
but...

1128
01:07:06,655 --> 01:07:08,953
the problem of what is
legally permissible

1129
01:07:09,091 --> 01:07:12,026
in the description of
sexual acts or feelings

1130
01:07:12,161 --> 01:07:15,096
in arts and literature
is of the greatest importance

1131
01:07:15,231 --> 01:07:17,165
to a free society.

1132
01:07:17,967 --> 01:07:19,764
What is "prurient"?

1133
01:07:20,236 --> 01:07:21,828
And to whom?

1134
01:07:22,338 --> 01:07:25,307
And the material so described
is dangerous to some

1135
01:07:25,441 --> 01:07:27,466
unspecified, susceptible reader.

1136
01:07:28,144 --> 01:07:29,372
it is interesting that

1137
01:07:29,512 --> 01:07:31,878
the person applying
such standards of censorship

1138
01:07:32,014 --> 01:07:34,380
rarely feels as if their own

1139
01:07:34,517 --> 01:07:37,008
physical or moral health
is in jeopardy.

1140
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:39,447
The desire to censor is...

1141
01:07:39,955 --> 01:07:42,583
not limited, however,
to crackpots and bigots.

1142
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:43,919
There is...

1143
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:46,453
in most of us, a desire to

1144
01:07:46,962 --> 01:07:49,624
make the world conform
to our own views.

1145
01:07:49,765 --> 01:07:52,757
And it takes all of the force
of our own reason as well as

1146
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:56,429
our legal institutions
to defy so human an urge.

1147
01:07:57,239 --> 01:07:59,207
The battle of censorship
will not be

1148
01:07:59,341 --> 01:08:01,775
finally settled by
Your Honor's decision,

1149
01:08:02,378 --> 01:08:06,041
but you will either add
to liberal, educated thinking,

1150
01:08:06,315 --> 01:08:08,840
or by your decision,
you will add fuel

1151
01:08:08,984 --> 01:08:10,918
to the fire of ignorance.

1152
01:08:12,988 --> 01:08:14,649
Let there be light.

1153
01:08:16,125 --> 01:08:18,184
Let there be honesty.

1154
01:08:19,128 --> 01:08:20,823
Let there be no running from

1155
01:08:20,963 --> 01:08:24,490
non existent
destroyers of morals.

1156
01:08:25,801 --> 01:08:28,793
Let there be
honest understanding.

1157
01:08:33,142 --> 01:08:35,542
Gentleman,
is the matter submitted?

1158
01:08:36,812 --> 01:08:38,473
it is submitted, Your Honor.

1159
01:08:40,149 --> 01:08:41,411
it is so submitted.

1160
01:09:13,015 --> 01:09:14,380
All rise.

1161
01:09:20,022 --> 01:09:21,216
Be seated.

1162
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:32,960
There are a number of words
used in "Howl"

1163
01:09:33,102 --> 01:09:36,128
that are presently considered
coarse and vulgar

1164
01:09:36,272 --> 01:09:38,240
in some circles
of the community,

1165
01:09:38,374 --> 01:09:41,810
and in other circles,
such words are in everyday use.

1166
01:09:42,211 --> 01:09:44,236
The author of "Howl"

1167
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:46,507
has used those words
because he believed that

1168
01:09:46,649 --> 01:09:50,016
his portrayal required them
as being in character.

1169
01:09:50,152 --> 01:09:53,952
The People state that such words
are not necessary

1170
01:09:54,089 --> 01:09:58,583
and that others would be
more palatable for good taste.

1171
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:03,859
The answer is that life is not
encased in one formula

1172
01:10:03,999 --> 01:10:05,933
whereby everyone acts the same

1173
01:10:06,068 --> 01:10:08,696
and conforms
to a particular pattern.

1174
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:11,939
No two persons think alike.

1175
01:10:12,074 --> 01:10:14,372
We were all made
from the same form

1176
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:16,769
but in different patterns.

1177
01:10:17,112 --> 01:10:19,603
Would there be any freedoms
of press or speech

1178
01:10:19,748 --> 01:10:22,012
if one must reduce
his vocabulary

1179
01:10:22,151 --> 01:10:24,346
to vapid, innocuous euphemism?

1180
01:10:24,486 --> 01:10:28,217
An author should be real
in treating his subject

1181
01:10:28,357 --> 01:10:30,587
and be allowed to express
his thoughts

1182
01:10:30,726 --> 01:10:32,956
and ideas in his own words.

1183
01:10:33,596 --> 01:10:36,292
in considering material
claimed to be obscene,

1184
01:10:36,432 --> 01:10:38,491
it is well
to remember the motto,

1185
01:10:38,634 --> 01:10:40,625
"Honi soit qui mal y pense"

1186
01:10:40,869 --> 01:10:43,997
"Evil to him who evil thinks."

1187
01:10:44,139 --> 01:10:46,767
The freedoms of speech and press

1188
01:10:46,909 --> 01:10:49,207
are inherent
in a nation of free people.

1189
01:10:49,345 --> 01:10:53,441
These freedoms must be protected
if we are to remain free,

1190
01:10:53,582 --> 01:10:56,312
both individually
and as a nation.

1191
01:10:57,486 --> 01:11:00,683
Therefore, I conclude that
the book "Howl and Other Poems"

1192
01:11:00,823 --> 01:11:04,054
does have some redeeming
social importance,

1193
01:11:04,426 --> 01:11:06,917
and I find the book
is not obscene.

1194
01:11:07,296 --> 01:11:09,526
The defendant
is found not guilty.

1195
01:11:34,657 --> 01:11:37,717
The crucial moment
of breakthrough came when

1196
01:11:38,427 --> 01:11:40,622
I realized
how funny it would be,

1197
01:11:40,763 --> 01:11:42,594
in the middle of a long poem,

1198
01:11:42,731 --> 01:11:44,494
if I said:

1199
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:47,191
"Who let themselves
be fucked in the ass

1200
01:11:47,336 --> 01:11:49,031
"and screamed with joy!"

1201
01:11:49,171 --> 01:11:51,298
Instead of
"and screamed with pain."

1202
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:53,374
That's the contradiction
in that line.

1203
01:11:53,509 --> 01:11:56,273
An American audience would
expect it to be pain and,

1204
01:11:56,412 --> 01:11:58,107
instead,
it's "screamed with joy!"

1205
01:11:58,247 --> 01:12:00,442
Which is really true.

1206
01:12:00,582 --> 01:12:02,243
Absolutely, 100%.

1207
01:12:03,285 --> 01:12:06,049
And, again, I have a line, like

1208
01:12:07,890 --> 01:12:10,757
"Who blew and were blown
by those human seraphim,

1209
01:12:10,893 --> 01:12:12,554
the sailors, caresses of

1210
01:12:12,695 --> 01:12:14,560
"Atlantic and Caribbean love."

1211
01:12:16,932 --> 01:12:18,331
it was
an acknowledgement of the

1212
01:12:18,467 --> 01:12:21,402
basic reality of homosexual joy.

1213
01:12:22,705 --> 01:12:25,299
That was a breakthrough
in the sense of

1214
01:12:25,941 --> 01:12:27,568
public statements about

1215
01:12:27,710 --> 01:12:30,543
feelings, emotions,
attitudes, you know,

1216
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:32,104
that...

1217
01:12:33,515 --> 01:12:37,474
I wouldn't have wanted
my father or my family to see,

1218
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:41,087
and that I even
hesitated to make public.

1219
01:12:47,296 --> 01:12:49,321
The poem is misinterpreted as...

1220
01:12:49,665 --> 01:12:51,895
a promotion of homosexuality.

1221
01:12:52,267 --> 01:12:55,361
Actually, it's...
more like a promotion of

1222
01:12:55,504 --> 01:12:58,268
frankness, about any subject.

1223
01:12:59,842 --> 01:13:03,278
If you're a foot fetishist,
you write about feet.

1224
01:13:03,412 --> 01:13:06,142
If you're a stock market freak,

1225
01:13:06,281 --> 01:13:09,842
you can write about
the rising sales curve erections

1226
01:13:09,985 --> 01:13:12,044
of the Standard Oil chart.

1227
01:13:13,555 --> 01:13:16,854
When a few people are...

1228
01:13:16,992 --> 01:13:18,823
frank about
homosexuality in public,

1229
01:13:18,961 --> 01:13:20,292
it breaks the ice.

1230
01:13:21,096 --> 01:13:24,759
Then people are free
to be frank about anything and...

1231
01:13:26,568 --> 01:13:28,627
That's socially useful.

1232
01:13:37,513 --> 01:13:39,538
Homosexuality is a condition,

1233
01:13:40,449 --> 01:13:42,849
and because it alienated me

1234
01:13:42,985 --> 01:13:44,714
or set me apart
from the beginning,

1235
01:13:44,853 --> 01:13:48,983
it served as a catalyst
for self examination,

1236
01:13:49,124 --> 01:13:50,386
or...

1237
01:13:51,226 --> 01:13:54,821
a detailed realization
of my environment and...

1238
01:13:55,597 --> 01:14:00,762
the reasons why
everyone else is different and

1239
01:14:02,871 --> 01:14:04,702
why I am different.

1240
01:14:23,025 --> 01:14:26,586
<i>Holy! Holy! Holy! Holy! Holy!</i>

1241
01:14:26,728 --> 01:14:30,186
<i>Holy! Holy! Holy! Holy! Holy!</i>

1242
01:14:30,332 --> 01:14:34,166

<i>The soul is holy!</i>

<i>The skin is holy!</i>

1246
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:44,108
<i>The nose is holy!</i>

1247
01:14:44,580 --> 01:14:48,539
<i>The tongue and cock</i>
<i>and hand and asshole, holy!</i>

1248
01:14:48,684 --> 01:14:50,208
<i>Everything is holy!</i>

1249
01:14:50,452 --> 01:14:52,181
<i>Everybody's holy!</i>

1250
01:14:52,421 --> 01:14:54,082
<i>Everywhere is holy!</i>

1251
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:56,757
<i>Everyday is an eternity!</i>

1252
01:14:56,892 --> 01:14:58,917
<i>Everyman's an angel!</i>

1253
01:14:59,194 --> 01:15:01,754
<i>The bum's as holy</i>
<i>as the seraphim!</i>

1254
01:15:01,897 --> 01:15:07,631
<i>The madman is holy</i>
<i>as you my soul are holy!</i>

1255
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:09,360
<i>The typewriter is holy!</i>

1256
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:11,097
<i>The poem is holy!</i>

1257
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:12,707
<i>The vole is holy!</i>

1258
01:15:12,841 --> 01:15:14,570
<i>The hearers are holy!</i>

1259
01:15:14,710 --> 01:15:16,940
<i>The ecstasy is holy!</i>

1260
01:15:17,613 --> 01:15:18,705
<i>Holy Peter!</i>

1261
01:15:18,847 --> 01:15:19,871
<i>Holy Allen!</i>

1262
01:15:20,215 --> 01:15:21,113
<i>Holy Solomon!</i>
