1
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,942
/Death be not proud

2
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:36,531
/Though some have called thee
/Mighty and dreadful

3
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:40,243
/For thou art not so

4
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:45,540
/One short sleep past
/We wake eternally

5
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:48,752
/And death shall be no more

6
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:53,673
/Death, thou shalt die

7
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:36,151
I told Charlie it was over.

8
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:42,949
You wouldn't dare,
would you, Vinnie?

9
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:51,583
Kassie, do you want some candy?

10
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,295
Or do you prefer cold turkey...

11
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,922
...thick-sliced?

12
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:25,492
Hey, Eddie, how's the plantation?

13
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,870
- I'm making the desert bloom, Cal.
- Goddamn.

14
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,872
What gets you up with the sun?

15
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,210
I don't know how you did this with one
arm. I couldn't have done it with two.

16
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:39,130
Just tell me why you're here.

17
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:43,134
Look, Kassie was arrested
last night.

18
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,430
She had an eight-gram deck
of Bart Simpson in her pocket.

19
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:50,934
The arresting officer recognized her,
brought her to me.

20
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,354
Kassie would die
before she touched that shit.

21
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:57,357
She must have been carrying
for someone else.

22
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:01,152
Eddie, I saw the track marks
on her arms.

23
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,530
Now, I tore up the charge sheet.

24
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:06,866
I tried to bring her out here,
but she jumped out the car...

25
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,828
...at the red light.
- Who's the balloon?

26
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,789
When she was arrested
she was alone.

27
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:18,086
I mean, I could put some time in
if you want.

28
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:19,921
Eddie!

29
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:12,807
You stupid useless fuck!

30
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:19,272
You killed everything
that ever mattered.

31
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:25,028
I want you to die!
Do you understand me?

32
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:46,424
I want you to die.

33
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:52,889
I want you to fucking die!

34
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:05,568
Bella's raising hell.
She wants the camera.

35
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,239
Take it.

36
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,786
Send Kassie up to my room.

37
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,832
She don't look too proud now.

38
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:23,169
I said, take it.

39
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:28,299
It was pure number four
when it left Hong Kong.

40
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:31,511
That's as far
as my guarantee extends.

41
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,388
Hey.

42
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:36,641
Leo, I know I'm new to this game.

43
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:42,188
But don't treat me
like a fucking asshole.

44
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:46,860
From now on
I'm handling things stateside.

45
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,862
This problem won't arise again.

46
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:54,367
Charlie, conflict is bad for business.

47
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:58,163
You have our apologies
and a new guarantee.

48
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,958
You also asked me for a favour.

49
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:09,841
These were much more difficult to find
than I anticipated.

50
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:12,510
And more expensive.

51
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:17,682
We've been running a blackmail scam
out of the Patpong girly bars for years.

52
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:21,811
Child prostitutes
and American tourists.

53
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,773
We have the supply,
you have the demand.

54
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:27,025
A white boy getting a blowjob,
so what?

55
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,611
Look again, Vincent.

56
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:32,989
Add a decade to the face.

57
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:38,161
How much?

58
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:42,999
Accept them as a goodwill gift
from your friends.

59
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,045
Well, tonight...

60
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:54,052
...we've scheduled some entertainment.
Which I hope will repay the favour.

61
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,221
What do you mean,
too tired?

62
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:41,975
I was hired for two cum shots
and that last one was it.

63
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:44,352
And it was a monster, I might add.

64
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,438
That was the three-way
dyke scene...

65
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:50,442
...you're only supposed to watch.
- I don't watch, lady. I fuck.

66
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:53,319
And dyke stuff is for faggots.

67
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:57,198
I had to go with the truth of the scene.
They wanted me, I felt it.

68
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:01,411
You ever heard of going
with the moment? The Method?

69
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:05,957
- You know, Strasberg and Stravinsky.
- It wasn't in the script, Marlon.

70
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:09,794
When the script gives me nothing,
I have to write the character.

71
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:13,882
You just wrote yourself a brand-new
ending. You're fired. Now fuck off!

72
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:17,510
Hey, Bella!
How's it going?

73
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:22,098
Jeff thinks we're doing a remake
of "On the Waterfront." Otherwise, fine.

74
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:27,812
- Hopefully this shit'll cut together later.
- Where's the pride in your craft?

75
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:30,523
I left it in New Jersey in a rat hole.

76
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,193
Charlie, this bitch
is breaking my balls, man.

77
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:37,405
- I'm not used to being treated this way.
- I know you're not, Jeff, honey.

78
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:42,494
In "Shaving Private Ryan" he was taking
enemas from a squad of Nazi troopers.

79
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:45,497
He's a better actor
than you give him credit for.

80
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,499
He looked like he was enjoying it.

81
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:51,378
Oh, and when you're finished in here,
leave the rig...

82
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:55,507
...and put the camera in the other room
behind the mirror.

83
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,885
A little home movie.
Consenting adults only.

84
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:05,016
Jeff, let's see some wood.

85
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,438
- Hello?
- "Eddie?"

86
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,024
Kassie, where are you?

87
00:12:57,444 --> 00:13:00,530
It's going to be okay, sis,
just let me come and get you.

88
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:07,328
Eddie, I'm so sorry.

89
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:12,167
- I'm just so sorry.
- Come home, Kassie.

90
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:16,379
- I can't do that.
- "We've been through worse than this."

91
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:19,883
/But if you stay in that city
/it'll burn you down so far...

92
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:22,427
/... you'll never come back up again.

93
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:24,471
/Let me bring you home.

94
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:27,390
/Are you still there?

95
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:30,310
/- Kassie?
- I'm here.

96
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:33,438
Just tell me where you are
and I'll come get you now.

97
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,940
I can't do that.

98
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,360
/I can get a doctor.

99
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,780
- I have to go.
/- Kassie, wait!

100
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,741
I love you, big brother.

101
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:52,665
- See you later, Eddie.
- Who is this?

102
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:00,799
You called him Eddie.

103
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:06,930
You know him.

104
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:09,766
I know a lot of people.

105
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:16,648
I'm leaving, Charlie.
I've had enough.

106
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:24,030
I own the pink slip
on your life, baby.

107
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:27,117
I say suck my cock,
you get down on your knees.

108
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:31,663
I say fuck a dog with yellow fever,
you spread your legs and you bark.

109
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:35,625
Why should I give two shits
what you say?

110
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:39,838
You want me to invite Eddie
down here?

111
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:43,425
You see, angel...

112
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:48,680
...in a world where men
screw children...

113
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:52,684
...what else is there
for a girl to do...

114
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,521
...except get high?

115
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:06,114
She's a survivor.

116
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,658
She's been using for months.

117
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:11,703
Why the emergency?

118
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:14,122
Why the emergency?

119
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:17,667
Because I served that cesspool
of a city for 15 years...

120
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:21,129
...and never so much as
took a free turkey at Christmas.

121
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:25,592
Now I've got one arm, a pension
and a cage to count the hours in.

122
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:30,055
Maybe I'm nobody,
but I want my sister safe.

123
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:33,933
The department owes me that,
and even if they don't, you do.

124
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:39,522
- I'll talk to the captain.
- We'll both talk to the captain.

125
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:41,399
Eddie.

126
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:44,235
She might call here again.

127
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:48,156
She might show up.
Stay here.

128
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:51,201
Remember...

129
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:55,080
...I don't have your patience.

130
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:35,972
- Going somewhere, madam?
- I need to go to the bathroom.

131
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,071
You...

132
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:59,329
You are nothing.

133
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:07,504
You feel nothing.

134
00:18:09,214 --> 00:18:10,882
You...

135
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:14,302
...want nothing.

136
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:19,599
You...

137
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:21,851
...are nothing.

138
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:26,773
So...

139
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:31,820
...nothing matters, right?

140
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:01,599
Can you get me out of here?
I mean now!

141
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:05,311
Charlie doesn't like when first-timers
cheat on a deal.

142
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:09,649
- No, you don't understand.
- Oh, I think I understand well enough.

143
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:11,276
Please help me.

144
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:18,158
Oh, shit.

145
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:23,997
Looks like we both
had a pretty tough day.

146
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:26,499
Let's go.

147
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:30,003
Party's upstairs, Kassie.

148
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:33,340
It's so easy to get lost in this place.

149
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:39,971
If you want a ride, just say so.

150
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:47,145
Whatever you said you'd do,
they've no right to keep you here.

151
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:50,148
When we need a lawyer
we'll give you a call.

152
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:52,692
Go scare some schoolgirls, Vincent.

153
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:56,029
Do you want to leave or not?

154
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:04,829
- I took a wrong turn.
- You sure?

155
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,624
You bitches finished?

156
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:12,003
- Kassie?
- I took a wrong turn.

157
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:18,927
Go home and feed your cats.

158
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,711
Pre- Noh style.

159
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:55,380
Very special.

160
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:57,757
Very rare.

161
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:04,639
No, no.

162
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:08,518
No! No!
No, no!

163
00:21:08,685 --> 00:21:09,769
No!

164
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:35,295
I didn't know gooks
were so big on ink.

165
00:21:55,357 --> 00:21:59,944
- I told you to go feed your cats.
- That girl was scared. I wanna know...

166
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:03,073
Get the fuck out of here.

167
00:22:21,216 --> 00:22:25,720
You know, I don't know if this is the
best time to open up my heart to you...

168
00:22:25,887 --> 00:22:31,184
...but the truth is, I kind of had a crush
on you ever since Charlie dug you up.

169
00:22:31,434 --> 00:22:34,771
You don't believe me?
Seriously, yes.

170
00:22:35,522 --> 00:22:39,150
Can't you see us together?
I mean, I think we make a great couple.

171
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:02,966
- I lost her.
- Well, go up to her apartment.

172
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:06,469
Clear it out.
Anything that might connect us.

173
00:23:14,561 --> 00:23:18,064
/- One number at the Public Safety
/Communication Centre.

174
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:23,778
/All 911 operators are currently
/handling calls. Please...

175
00:24:33,223 --> 00:24:35,475
Now we've all got debts to pay.

176
00:25:12,595 --> 00:25:14,806
I'm sorry, Kassie.

177
00:25:44,794 --> 00:25:46,546
Do it.

178
00:25:56,765 --> 00:25:59,434
- Yeah?
- "Hey, Eddie".

179
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:04,439
You still awake? I thought you cripples
went to bed early.

180
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:10,570
I hope you believe
in a forgiving God.

181
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:14,324
- It's time for redemption of sin.
- Where's Kassie?

182
00:26:14,532 --> 00:26:17,702
She wanted to spend some time
with her parents.

183
00:26:17,869 --> 00:26:21,122
I'd hobble on down there if I were you.
Right now.

184
00:26:48,441 --> 00:26:50,235
Kassie!

185
00:27:48,335 --> 00:27:52,756
You did a great job getting her here
alive. She was in respiratory arrest.

186
00:27:52,922 --> 00:27:56,676
- How is she now, doc?
- She's breathing on her own again.

187
00:27:56,843 --> 00:28:00,680
If it wasn't for her tolerance
she would have died instantly.

188
00:28:00,889 --> 00:28:04,184
- What are her chances?
- Of survival, excellent.

189
00:28:05,185 --> 00:28:09,439
But she is still in a coma.
It's too early for MRI scans.

190
00:28:09,606 --> 00:28:12,692
We won't know if there's residual
neurological deficit...

191
00:28:12,859 --> 00:28:17,530
...until she regains consciousness.
- Was she abused?

192
00:28:26,414 --> 00:28:29,709
I'd like a minute alone with my sister.

193
00:29:05,412 --> 00:29:07,622
Hello, Bella.

194
00:29:08,164 --> 00:29:09,833
Mr. Burns?

195
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:14,713
- Yeah?
- How is she, Eddie?

196
00:29:15,547 --> 00:29:20,260
- Alive.
- "Well, there's always next time."

197
00:29:20,427 --> 00:29:24,014
- What do you want?
- Well, I got what I want, cripple.

198
00:29:24,222 --> 00:29:26,641
- I got you shitting blood.
- Cut to the chase.

199
00:29:26,808 --> 00:29:28,643
/You sinned, Eddie.

200
00:29:29,185 --> 00:29:31,021
And you're gonna pay.

201
00:29:31,187 --> 00:29:32,856
In this world and the next.

202
00:29:33,273 --> 00:29:35,859
I'm gonna take you on a slow waltz
through hell.

203
00:29:36,192 --> 00:29:39,237
When you wanna dance,
you let me know.

204
00:29:39,404 --> 00:29:41,698
Otherwise, stop wasting my time.

205
00:29:52,167 --> 00:29:55,045
Someone wants to hear
me scream, Cal.

206
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:57,130
Who?

207
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:59,424
I don't know.

208
00:29:59,632 --> 00:30:01,593
I want a guard on Kassie's room.

209
00:30:01,801 --> 00:30:06,348
Check the files, find out who's got
the motive, patience, imagination.

210
00:30:06,514 --> 00:30:08,433
- You run that plate?
- Bella Schuman.

211
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,935
I got people checking her apartment.

212
00:30:11,311 --> 00:30:14,397
- Where you going?
- Home. No guards, no surveillance.

213
00:30:14,564 --> 00:30:17,984
- I want him to come to me.
- Eddie.

214
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:22,655
This isn't your job anymore.

215
00:30:23,573 --> 00:30:26,076
I just made it my job.

216
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,874
You don't wanna help...

217
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,418
...stay out of my way.

218
00:32:12,057 --> 00:32:15,226
- Yeah?
- Two thumbs up, Eddie?

219
00:32:15,435 --> 00:32:19,397
Or maybe in your case
I should say one.

220
00:32:20,023 --> 00:32:21,566
You enjoy the show?

221
00:32:25,153 --> 00:32:27,322
I've seen worse.

222
00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:29,616
Have you?

223
00:32:33,787 --> 00:32:38,041
See, that's the difference
between you and me, kingfish.

224
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:41,044
Whatever you've seen...

225
00:32:41,211 --> 00:32:43,004
...I've seen worse.

226
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,674
/And whatever you've done...

227
00:32:46,341 --> 00:32:48,677
/... I've done worse.

228
00:32:48,885 --> 00:32:54,683
And what's keeping me warm inside
is knowing that whatever I did to you...

229
00:32:54,849 --> 00:32:57,227
...I hurt you real bad.

230
00:32:57,852 --> 00:33:00,647
Listen to me, half-man.

231
00:33:00,939 --> 00:33:04,609
You want me? Good.

232
00:33:05,068 --> 00:33:07,529
You bring all the muscle you can get.

233
00:33:07,737 --> 00:33:09,823
/But take my advice.

234
00:33:10,115 --> 00:33:13,576
I won't be reading anyone their rights.

235
00:33:13,743 --> 00:33:16,121
And I won't be taking prisoners.

236
00:33:39,978 --> 00:33:41,688
That's some heavy shit, Ed.

237
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:47,444
Damn, man, this shit
is beyond pale, Ed.

238
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:49,738
Man, who is she?

239
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:52,032
My sister.

240
00:33:55,535 --> 00:33:57,454
Oh, Jesus, Eddie.

241
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:00,707
This is cut so we're only meant
to see Kassie's face...

242
00:34:00,874 --> 00:34:05,420
...not the animals in there with her.
- That's right, I don't see them.

243
00:34:06,171 --> 00:34:07,964
Fast-forward.

244
00:34:08,131 --> 00:34:11,217
There. They missed one.

245
00:34:12,761 --> 00:34:16,056
Let's just see who you are,
motherfucker.

246
00:34:24,397 --> 00:34:26,191
Hey, hold up.

247
00:34:26,775 --> 00:34:28,610
Wait a minute.

248
00:34:29,194 --> 00:34:31,529
Yeah, there's somebody else here.

249
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:35,658
Can't see his face, but...

250
00:34:41,623 --> 00:34:43,333
Here you go.

251
00:34:48,672 --> 00:34:50,131
Hey, Ed, man.

252
00:34:50,757 --> 00:34:54,636
You need some help, I know some
people that'll do these motherfuckers.

253
00:34:54,844 --> 00:34:56,554
Gratis.

254
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,850
I'm gonna take care of them.

255
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:05,063
- Thanks, brother.
- Hey, no problem.

256
00:35:11,152 --> 00:35:13,488
I saw tats like this in the '80s
in Bangkok.

257
00:35:13,822 --> 00:35:17,492
These symbols are a lucky charm.
Face looks Thai too.

258
00:35:17,659 --> 00:35:19,744
- Smack peddlers?
- I don't know.

259
00:35:20,078 --> 00:35:22,706
I'll try to get these ID'd.

260
00:35:22,872 --> 00:35:25,125
- Captain.
- Eddie.

261
00:35:25,458 --> 00:35:28,253
Cal called me at home last night.
I'm sorry.

262
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:30,672
- How is she?
- Still unconscious.

263
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:35,301
Targeting a former officer is unusual.
In fact, it's almost unknown.

264
00:35:35,468 --> 00:35:38,972
Whoever did this knows we'll throw
everything we've got at them.

265
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:41,599
Intelligent psychopath with brass balls.

266
00:35:41,808 --> 00:35:44,769
It won't matter once I've got
my hand on them.

267
00:35:45,103 --> 00:35:47,731
We'll bring these animals in, Eddie.

268
00:35:48,231 --> 00:35:51,526
I'll put every other case on
the back burner until we do.

269
00:35:51,693 --> 00:35:53,570
But hear me now.

270
00:35:54,362 --> 00:35:56,781
I'll say this only once.

271
00:35:57,157 --> 00:35:59,117
You're not a cop.

272
00:35:59,576 --> 00:36:01,119
Not anymore.

273
00:36:01,286 --> 00:36:03,872
You have no authority
from this department.

274
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,627
There's another side of that coin,
captain.

275
00:36:09,878 --> 00:36:13,131
This department has
no authority over me.

276
00:36:14,049 --> 00:36:16,634
How many men would it take
to get him in a cell?

277
00:36:16,843 --> 00:36:20,764
I figure no more than five or six,
if you include me and you.

278
00:36:20,972 --> 00:36:24,559
Hell, let's call it protective custody.

279
00:36:27,145 --> 00:36:29,564
When you took the cat-bird seat,
captain...

280
00:36:30,148 --> 00:36:35,403
...there were a lot of people here who
wanted to see you fall and fall hard.

281
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:39,866
There was one man you could trust
who stood by your side.

282
00:36:40,033 --> 00:36:42,660
That doesn't mean I can
let you break the law.

283
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:47,499
- I wasn't asking your permission.
- You didn't ask last time either.

284
00:36:50,794 --> 00:36:52,504
Well, then...

285
00:36:53,213 --> 00:36:55,340
...that makes us even.

286
00:36:55,548 --> 00:36:58,802
- Lf anything breaks, you'll know first.
- Thanks.

287
00:36:58,968 --> 00:37:04,140
And, Eddie, thanks for keeping my poor
old ass perched on the cat-bird seat.

288
00:37:04,557 --> 00:37:09,020
You're welcome.
Only a son of a bitch would want it.

289
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:16,569
So where's our friend, Mr. Lakorn?

290
00:37:16,736 --> 00:37:22,367
At his motel. Too much whiskey
last night. Head sick.

291
00:37:22,534 --> 00:37:24,619
No, they'd be disappointed.

292
00:37:24,786 --> 00:37:27,956
Vincent and I thought you should
make more each day...

293
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:31,543
...so we laid on another adventure.

294
00:37:43,555 --> 00:37:47,017
Thorazine. She'll be out
for a couple of more hours.

295
00:37:47,183 --> 00:37:51,187
Vincent will recommend
somewhere really quiet.

296
00:37:51,646 --> 00:37:53,523
You see, Leo...

297
00:37:54,065 --> 00:37:59,863
...there are places in this state that
could be on the dark side of the moon.

298
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:03,908
We'd very much prefer it
if she didn't come back.

299
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,175
Jesus Christ, what the fuck?

300
00:38:24,137 --> 00:38:26,473
Don't tell me I fucked you,
too, last night.

301
00:38:27,015 --> 00:38:29,768
You should be so lucky, Conrad.

302
00:38:31,436 --> 00:38:35,148
Those sheets cost me 300 bucks, man.

303
00:38:37,942 --> 00:38:41,529
Cressida's hair-dressing bill
is gonna break me.

304
00:38:42,655 --> 00:38:44,908
Oh, jeez.

305
00:38:46,451 --> 00:38:49,371
I haven't even had my morning fatty.

306
00:38:51,331 --> 00:38:54,000
You don't mind if I skin one up,
do you, Eddie?

307
00:38:54,167 --> 00:38:58,004
- Help yourself.
- I can't think straight when I'm straight.

308
00:39:03,343 --> 00:39:05,261
There we go.

309
00:39:05,762 --> 00:39:08,056
You disappoint me, Conrad.

310
00:39:08,223 --> 00:39:10,600
I thought you were a pitcher.

311
00:39:13,395 --> 00:39:17,023
Age does terrible things to the libido.

312
00:39:17,232 --> 00:39:19,984
A man's gotta seek new horizons.

313
00:39:20,568 --> 00:39:25,281
I thought they'd farmed you out. I know
guys who celebrated for two weeks.

314
00:39:27,117 --> 00:39:28,910
What's the beef?

315
00:39:33,206 --> 00:39:36,084
- Burns.
- Yeah, we lucked out with the photo.

316
00:39:36,251 --> 00:39:39,504
Face works for the
Thai Trade Delegation in L.A.

317
00:39:39,671 --> 00:39:41,214
Name of Lakorn.

318
00:39:41,506 --> 00:39:43,258
/U.S. Customs had an eye on him.

319
00:39:43,466 --> 00:39:46,011
/Suspected smuggling scam.
/Never found out what.

320
00:39:46,219 --> 00:39:49,889
Now, get this: He's got
diplomatic immunity.

321
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:52,434
- Where's he staying?
- At the Triple- X Motel.

322
00:39:52,726 --> 00:39:56,229
I'll be there in 30. And wait for me.

323
00:39:57,814 --> 00:40:00,650
I'm looking for people
who abducted and raped a girl.

324
00:40:01,026 --> 00:40:03,570
- Her name is Kassie.
- Who is she?

325
00:40:03,737 --> 00:40:06,740
She's... A dope addict.

326
00:40:06,906 --> 00:40:10,535
Eddie, smack ain't for me
these days. Or crack.

327
00:40:10,702 --> 00:40:13,663
I put all that shit behind me, I swear.

328
00:40:14,998 --> 00:40:17,083
Just grass now.

329
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,419
Okay, maybe a little coke.

330
00:40:19,586 --> 00:40:22,213
I'm Mr. Clean, man. I'm Mr. Happy.

331
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:24,299
I just want everybody to have fun.

332
00:40:24,466 --> 00:40:26,551
- Know what I'm saying?
- Okay, Mr. Happy.

333
00:40:26,718 --> 00:40:29,512
Check out the dealers,
jugglers and thoroughbreds.

334
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:31,681
Especially any with Thai connections.

335
00:40:31,848 --> 00:40:36,061
- I wanna know who was supplying her.
- Eddie, that's not my scene, man.

336
00:40:36,227 --> 00:40:40,940
That's not my scene at all.
Those guys are pure fucking poison. L...

337
00:40:41,399 --> 00:40:44,027
I'll see what I can do, okay?

338
00:40:44,194 --> 00:40:46,738
- Can I keep this?
- Yeah.

339
00:40:46,905 --> 00:40:49,741
I also want a line on a New Yorker,
Bella Schuman.

340
00:40:49,908 --> 00:40:55,205
Thirties, black hair about so long,
good-looking, wears leather.

341
00:40:55,372 --> 00:40:57,082
That's it?

342
00:40:57,248 --> 00:40:59,167
This is Reno, not Waco.

343
00:40:59,334 --> 00:41:03,797
- Half the waitresses look like that.
- So get dressed and get to work.

344
00:41:03,963 --> 00:41:08,510
Eddie, you ever tried taking
common courtesy for a spin?

345
00:41:08,677 --> 00:41:11,638
Maybe you knock on the door
instead of breaking in?

346
00:41:11,805 --> 00:41:17,227
Maybe a tap on the shoulder instead
of the Bloody Mary wake- up call?

347
00:41:17,394 --> 00:41:21,272
Just little politesse, man.
You know what I'm saying?

348
00:41:21,981 --> 00:41:24,484
Please, Conrad...

349
00:41:24,651 --> 00:41:26,945
...get the fuck to work.

350
00:41:29,989 --> 00:41:31,658
Kind of.

351
00:41:34,953 --> 00:41:36,705
Brody.

352
00:41:36,871 --> 00:41:40,583
- Yeah, we need to talk, lieutenant.
- Who the fuck is "we?

353
00:41:40,875 --> 00:41:43,128
About your service days in Bangkok.

354
00:41:43,837 --> 00:41:46,631
/In the 80s?
/You remember, don't you, Cal?

355
00:41:47,382 --> 00:41:51,302
R&R in Patpong Row.

356
00:41:51,511 --> 00:41:55,890
- You're the cocksucker working Eddie.
- I hear you got two little daughters.

357
00:41:56,057 --> 00:41:58,685
It must be hard for a man
like you to resist.

358
00:41:59,978 --> 00:42:03,440
- Who is this?
- Now, speaking of cocksuckers...

359
00:42:03,606 --> 00:42:06,860
...I'm looking at a picture
of a 12-year-old girl...

360
00:42:07,027 --> 00:42:10,071
...with a U.S. Government-issue hard-on
in her mouth.

361
00:42:10,655 --> 00:42:14,951
Gee, lieutenant, I wonder
if it could be yours?

362
00:42:16,661 --> 00:42:21,082
Sammy's Lounge, 15 minutes,
or I e-mail a high-res JPEG...

363
00:42:21,249 --> 00:42:24,294
...of this Hallmark moment...

364
00:42:24,461 --> 00:42:30,342
...to your wife, your kids' school
and the entire Reno police.

365
00:42:36,806 --> 00:42:38,600
Captain.

366
00:42:39,476 --> 00:42:43,229
You look as if you just swallowed
a large poisonous insect.

367
00:42:44,731 --> 00:42:46,524
Yes, sir.

368
00:42:46,691 --> 00:42:49,527
That's what enables me
to work 17-hour days.

369
00:42:49,694 --> 00:42:53,782
- I eat them instead of donuts.
- The time I protected Eddie...

370
00:42:53,948 --> 00:42:59,454
...kept Internal Affairs and the DA
off his back, it's been on my mind.

371
00:42:59,662 --> 00:43:03,833
- Sir?
- Eddie's last case before retiring.

372
00:43:04,417 --> 00:43:09,631
The boy who hung himself in his cell.
Kraken, Marty Kraken.

373
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:11,132
Yeah, cop-killer.

374
00:43:11,341 --> 00:43:13,927
You and Eddie made the collar
together.

375
00:43:14,469 --> 00:43:16,805
You figure there's a connection
to Kassie?

376
00:43:17,222 --> 00:43:21,351
Kraken was a low-life,
a punk, a nobody.

377
00:43:21,601 --> 00:43:24,604
As far as we could tell,
he wasn't connected to anyone.

378
00:43:24,771 --> 00:43:27,607
No family, no Mob ties.

379
00:43:27,774 --> 00:43:30,402
Whoever's leaning on Eddie
is hardcore.

380
00:43:30,568 --> 00:43:33,738
What did Eddie do to the Kraken kid?

381
00:43:38,451 --> 00:43:42,080
That kid blew Tommy Mullen away
with a 12-gauge shotgun.

382
00:43:42,247 --> 00:43:46,668
A lot of guys would've shot the punk
and claimed a citation for valour.

383
00:43:53,133 --> 00:43:56,011
We made him shit in his pants,
so what?

384
00:43:56,594 --> 00:44:00,682
We told him how many blowjobs he'd
be giving at Lovelock, so what?

385
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:04,436
If Eddie laid one horrible beating
on him that night, so what?

386
00:44:05,061 --> 00:44:09,941
What's a cop-killer suicide got to do
with finding the psychos out there?

387
00:44:12,027 --> 00:44:15,113
Maybe you should lay off
those insects, Cal.

388
00:44:16,614 --> 00:44:19,659
Yeah, well, I need to be somewhere.

389
00:44:21,578 --> 00:44:23,913
We live with the dregs, lieutenant.

390
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:28,710
We talk to them, we touch them.
We smell what they ate for dinner.

391
00:44:28,877 --> 00:44:32,339
We see how they squandered
the lives God gave them.

392
00:44:32,505 --> 00:44:37,177
And if we become contaminated,
we squander our lives too.

393
00:44:37,344 --> 00:44:42,932
The rules that we follow, the rules
I insist we follow, protect us.

394
00:44:43,099 --> 00:44:47,062
You and me and Eddie.

395
00:44:47,228 --> 00:44:49,022
Not them.

396
00:44:49,981 --> 00:44:53,568
That's the "so what."

397
00:44:54,152 --> 00:44:56,946
And if you're already contaminated?

398
00:45:03,036 --> 00:45:08,833
If you've got something to tell me, Cal,
there's no better time than right now.

399
00:45:15,674 --> 00:45:18,134
I got a lead on the Thais.

400
00:45:18,301 --> 00:45:21,346
I told Eddie he could come
along with me.

401
00:45:24,516 --> 00:45:28,019
Just remember who's the one
with the badge.

402
00:45:43,451 --> 00:45:45,412
What do you want?

403
00:45:46,162 --> 00:45:48,373
You want trouble?

404
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,147
What do you want?

405
00:46:12,897 --> 00:46:15,483
I saw a photo of you this morning.

406
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:20,321
You were laughing.

407
00:46:28,496 --> 00:46:30,665
That's my sister.

408
00:46:31,249 --> 00:46:32,834
Yeah.

409
00:46:35,462 --> 00:46:38,298
Let me hear you laugh now.

410
00:46:38,923 --> 00:46:40,675
Come on!

411
00:46:41,468 --> 00:46:43,178
Let me hear you laugh.

412
00:46:45,555 --> 00:46:47,474
Let me hear you laugh!

413
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:50,643
Come on, big man, laughing boy!

414
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:52,812
You have fun?

415
00:46:54,356 --> 00:46:57,359
You take turns making her scream?

416
00:47:03,948 --> 00:47:06,326
The guy with the tattoo.

417
00:47:06,826 --> 00:47:09,162
The tattoo, his name.

418
00:47:10,622 --> 00:47:13,083
- Thamaree.
- What?

419
00:47:13,583 --> 00:47:17,629
- Thamaree.
- Where's he staying?

420
00:47:18,296 --> 00:47:19,756
The El Royale Motel.

421
00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:24,052
Who's the guy who set this up,
the American?

422
00:47:24,427 --> 00:47:27,097
The man who set this up, who is he?

423
00:47:38,191 --> 00:47:41,486
I have diplomatic immunity.

424
00:47:43,488 --> 00:47:46,991
I'm trying to be diplomatic.

425
00:48:39,461 --> 00:48:42,297
Police. I'm looking for Mr. Thamaree.

426
00:49:15,830 --> 00:49:19,376
Did you realize, Vincent,
that but for our vigilance...

427
00:49:19,542 --> 00:49:23,171
...copies of that photo would be
circulating right now on the Web?

428
00:49:23,338 --> 00:49:26,341
Friends in need, Charlie.
Friends indeed.

429
00:49:26,549 --> 00:49:29,219
There are 500,000 paedophiles
in North America...

430
00:49:29,386 --> 00:49:32,305
...they consume 85 percent
of the world's kiddie porn.

431
00:49:32,514 --> 00:49:35,684
Imagine what it must feel like
having that many scumbags...

432
00:49:35,850 --> 00:49:38,269
...jerking themselves off
over your image.

433
00:49:38,436 --> 00:49:41,106
I don't have to listen to this shit.
You're sick.

434
00:49:41,272 --> 00:49:42,315
Sick?

435
00:49:42,524 --> 00:49:46,236
I'm sorry, lieutenant, do you know
what she has in her mouth...

436
00:49:46,403 --> 00:49:48,988
...and who it belongs to?
- Listen, asshole...

437
00:49:49,155 --> 00:49:53,493
...I was 22 years old, I got shitfaced
on Mekong whisky and Thai stick.

438
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:55,537
Fucked a teenage hooker.

439
00:49:55,745 --> 00:49:58,915
If I wanted, I could do the same thing
down the street.

440
00:49:59,082 --> 00:50:03,086
But it was a one- off and when
I woke up I threw my guts up.

441
00:50:03,253 --> 00:50:07,966
We understand, Cal. You know,
we're not judging you, but...

442
00:50:08,675 --> 00:50:10,176
...other people...
- Others.

443
00:50:10,385 --> 00:50:12,762
- Captain Oakes.
- Your lovely wife.

444
00:50:13,304 --> 00:50:15,515
Eddie Burns.

445
00:50:19,227 --> 00:50:21,521
What did Eddie do to you?

446
00:50:25,233 --> 00:50:27,444
Eddie has sinned.

447
00:50:29,863 --> 00:50:33,950
God may plan to punish Eddie
in the next world...

448
00:50:34,117 --> 00:50:37,037
...but I intend to punish him
in this one.

449
00:50:37,203 --> 00:50:39,372
And you're gonna help me.

450
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:49,966
I'll help you. I'll help you scrape
your brains off the wall.

451
00:50:53,345 --> 00:50:56,222
In all those e- mails of your
private parts and it's...

452
00:50:56,389 --> 00:50:59,100
It's just as well you carry
such a big handgun...

453
00:50:59,267 --> 00:51:03,605
...because I couldn't use you in my
pictures. They're set to fly in an hour.

454
00:51:03,772 --> 00:51:07,025
If you run, you can make the airport.

455
00:51:12,322 --> 00:51:13,948
Who are you?

456
00:51:14,616 --> 00:51:17,660
I'm a man offering you a chance
to redeem yourself.

457
00:51:21,081 --> 00:51:23,041
You do want to redeem yourself?

458
00:51:23,333 --> 00:51:24,709
Don't you?

459
00:51:38,306 --> 00:51:40,183
By the way...

460
00:51:41,643 --> 00:51:45,105
...you remember a kid
called Marty Kraken...

461
00:51:47,399 --> 00:51:50,193
...that hung himself with a sheet...

462
00:51:50,568 --> 00:51:52,320
...in one of your cells?

463
00:51:55,198 --> 00:51:57,158
You remember him?

464
00:52:00,578 --> 00:52:02,789
Marty was my brother.

465
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:11,840
Vincent here will tell you what to do.

466
00:52:26,855 --> 00:52:29,482
It's Tommy Mullen. Shotgun.

467
00:52:30,525 --> 00:52:32,235
Eddie, wait for backup!

468
00:52:41,703 --> 00:52:42,871
Eddie, that's enough!

469
00:52:43,079 --> 00:52:44,789
Cop-killer!

470
00:52:47,876 --> 00:52:49,252
Cal, watch out!

471
00:52:53,715 --> 00:52:54,841
Eddie!

472
00:54:17,674 --> 00:54:19,676
Thamaree!

473
00:54:20,844 --> 00:54:22,887
Thamaree!

474
00:54:27,267 --> 00:54:29,436
Bella, it's Eddie Burns.

475
00:54:31,855 --> 00:54:35,191
- Can he understand me?
- I don't think so.

476
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,110
Do exactly as I say.

477
00:54:37,277 --> 00:54:40,530
Count off 10 seconds,
turn to the back door...

478
00:54:40,697 --> 00:54:43,366
...and shout my name like I'm there.

479
00:54:44,826 --> 00:54:48,246
Thamaree! Thamaree!

480
00:54:49,205 --> 00:54:51,332
Eddie!

481
00:55:15,482 --> 00:55:18,526
I wanted to keep this one alive
for a while.

482
00:55:19,569 --> 00:55:22,947
Guess you're gonna have
to tell me who I'm looking for.

483
00:55:37,629 --> 00:55:39,881
You got things to tell me?

484
00:55:40,298 --> 00:55:43,301
Have you any idea what
they were gonna do to me?

485
00:55:43,468 --> 00:55:45,261
Yes, I do.

486
00:55:45,428 --> 00:55:46,721
Have you?

487
00:55:46,888 --> 00:55:51,309
Don't you get tired of being so tough?
Don't you ever take a break?

488
00:55:51,476 --> 00:55:54,229
Those scum are your friends,
baby, not mine.

489
00:55:54,521 --> 00:55:58,108
I have been drugged, kidnapped
and driven through the desert...

490
00:55:58,274 --> 00:56:00,735
...in a trunk of a fucking rental car...

491
00:56:00,944 --> 00:56:05,490
...and forced to watch you shoot two
men, which I am willing to forgive.

492
00:56:05,657 --> 00:56:09,160
But I will not have you call me "baby."

493
00:56:09,744 --> 00:56:11,579
Is that clear?

494
00:56:22,424 --> 00:56:23,883
Here.

495
00:56:24,843 --> 00:56:27,345
There's more in the cooler
if you need it.

496
00:57:18,229 --> 00:57:20,648
- Conrad?
- "Eduardo, my boy!"

497
00:57:20,857 --> 00:57:24,861
This Kassie chick was seen leaving
a club early hours yesterday morning...

498
00:57:25,028 --> 00:57:27,989
...with a dealer named Grady White.
- "Where is he?"

499
00:57:28,198 --> 00:57:33,036
On a life- support machine in Washoe
County Hospital, brain-dead on arrival.

500
00:57:33,244 --> 00:57:36,748
My guess is the guys you want
gave him the bad haircut.

501
00:57:36,956 --> 00:57:38,458
Well, thanks anyway.

502
00:57:39,125 --> 00:57:45,548
Politesse, man, politesse.
Well done, well done.

503
00:57:45,715 --> 00:57:52,138
Say, Bella Schuman, that's two you
owe me for, she directs B-grade porn.

504
00:57:54,224 --> 00:57:58,895
/Two chicks lick each other out then
/find a basketball team in the closet.

505
00:57:59,062 --> 00:58:02,899
- Who for?
- For the likes of us, I guess.

506
00:58:03,108 --> 00:58:06,403
The film company, Conrad.
The producers.

507
00:58:06,611 --> 00:58:10,156
It seems she was an avant-garde
filmmaker in New York City...

508
00:58:10,365 --> 00:58:13,159
/...but we don't know who she directs...
- Find out.

509
00:58:13,368 --> 00:58:16,496
Eddie, I have done
my good deed for the day.

510
00:58:16,663 --> 00:58:20,083
I'm swamped here.
I gotta get back to work.

511
00:58:34,264 --> 00:58:37,559
I'd forgotten something
could be so beautiful.

512
00:58:37,726 --> 00:58:42,105
Yeah, it must be a nice change from
filming gangbangs in cheap motels.

513
00:58:42,147 --> 00:58:43,732
I made my deal with
this messed- up world.

514
00:58:43,898 --> 00:58:45,900
I never broke the law or hurt anyone.

515
00:58:46,067 --> 00:58:49,779
- You mean anyone like Kassie?
- Do you think I'm responsible?

516
00:58:49,946 --> 00:58:52,532
- You ran out on me.
- I didn't want to get killed.

517
00:58:52,699 --> 00:58:55,035
So why'd you try to help her?

518
00:58:55,326 --> 00:58:58,663
I know what it's like to be a piece
of meat in a pack of dogs.

519
00:58:58,830 --> 00:59:02,625
- Who tried to kill my sister?
- I won't tell you.

520
00:59:02,834 --> 00:59:06,338
- I figured you for guts, Bella.
- Well, figure me for brains too.

521
00:59:06,504 --> 00:59:09,299
You didn't see what they did to Kassie.

522
00:59:10,008 --> 00:59:11,843
Who are they?

523
00:59:15,805 --> 00:59:18,725
I film gangbangs, Eddie.

524
00:59:20,393 --> 00:59:23,313
Goods don't come any
more soiled than me.

525
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:27,150
The lawyers would take me apart,
if they didn't whack me first.

526
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:30,111
- There won't be a trial.
- I'm going to New Jersey.

527
00:59:30,278 --> 00:59:32,822
- I can't help you.
- You wanna talk some more...

528
00:59:33,031 --> 00:59:35,283
...about beauty first?
- Out of my way.

529
00:59:35,492 --> 00:59:38,203
- You don't get off so easy.
- Get your hands off me.

530
00:59:38,578 --> 00:59:40,705
- What?
- I kept Kassie alive.

531
00:59:40,872 --> 00:59:43,500
Where were you when she needed you?

532
00:59:43,667 --> 00:59:47,337
I want his name!
I want a name!

533
00:59:47,504 --> 00:59:51,299
- Go to hell!
- His name!

534
00:59:57,347 --> 00:59:58,807
- Fuck you!
- His name!

535
00:59:59,516 --> 01:00:01,851
His name, his name!

536
01:00:03,978 --> 01:00:05,605
No!

537
01:00:12,987 --> 01:00:14,656
Why not?

538
01:00:16,658 --> 01:00:19,244
Because this is wrong!

539
01:00:27,711 --> 01:00:29,879
Because you don't scare me.

540
01:00:32,007 --> 01:00:34,426
Because I know you're not like them.

541
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:08,793
They're Kassie's.

542
01:01:09,502 --> 01:01:11,254
That bother you?

543
01:01:22,432 --> 01:01:24,893
- Yeah?
- The guy we want's a scumbag.

544
01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:27,479
Makes porno films.
Name of Charlie Strom.

545
01:01:27,896 --> 01:01:31,733
/I've never heard of him either. He's got
/a hard-on to make you scream.

546
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:34,652
Wants to see you tonight,
just you and him.

547
01:01:34,819 --> 01:01:37,781
Sounds like he's been watching
too many Westerns.

548
01:01:37,947 --> 01:01:41,993
Yeah, I hear you.
But listen: Legally, Strom's clean.

549
01:01:42,494 --> 01:01:47,040
If you want to nail him,
this is the only way.

550
01:01:51,086 --> 01:01:56,257
Be at Jansen's Gas and General
at 9: 15. You'll be contacted there.

551
01:01:56,424 --> 01:01:58,259
/9:15, got it.

552
01:01:58,468 --> 01:02:01,221
- Did you tell the captain?
- No.

553
01:02:01,388 --> 01:02:04,641
- Thanks, partner.
- Hey.

554
01:02:05,225 --> 01:02:08,311
Just let me know where
to find the bodies.

555
01:02:10,105 --> 01:02:12,899
You should work for us full-time,
lieutenant.

556
01:02:15,485 --> 01:02:17,862
- Keep him here till 11:00.
- You got it.

557
01:02:18,071 --> 01:02:22,659
And why don't you buy
yourself another.

558
01:02:40,051 --> 01:02:42,220
It's Eddie, Kassie.

559
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:45,056
You're safe.

560
01:02:45,807 --> 01:02:47,726
You're safe now.

561
01:02:51,563 --> 01:02:53,857
He kept calling me.

562
01:02:54,024 --> 01:02:58,361
He bought me flowers, Charlie did.

563
01:02:59,696 --> 01:03:02,282
He told me it was just coke.

564
01:03:02,699 --> 01:03:06,578
Just one line, just one
little line, that's all.

565
01:03:07,037 --> 01:03:09,205
- I knew you'd hate me.
- That's not true.

566
01:03:09,372 --> 01:03:12,584
No, I knew, I knew.

567
01:03:13,668 --> 01:03:15,545
In my head...

568
01:03:15,712 --> 01:03:17,630
...I knew what it was.

569
01:03:20,592 --> 01:03:24,054
It was this cradle...

570
01:03:24,220 --> 01:03:26,806
...rocking me to sleep.

571
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:32,812
And it made everything okay again.

572
01:03:36,274 --> 01:03:38,193
Mama.

573
01:03:39,486 --> 01:03:41,488
Papa.

574
01:03:43,073 --> 01:03:45,200
Everything.

575
01:03:51,581 --> 01:03:56,503
- I tried to run away, but I couldn't...
- Listen to me, Kassie.

576
01:03:59,339 --> 01:04:01,132
And believe me...

577
01:04:02,884 --> 01:04:05,387
...I don't care what you've done...

578
01:04:06,346 --> 01:04:08,556
...or who you did it with.

579
01:04:09,891 --> 01:04:12,394
I only care that you're safe...

580
01:04:12,811 --> 01:04:14,896
...and that you get well.

581
01:04:17,607 --> 01:04:19,401
I love you.

582
01:04:21,361 --> 01:04:23,655
I'll always love you...

583
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:29,911
...no matter what you do
or where you go, I'll love you.

584
01:04:33,206 --> 01:04:35,667
They hurt me.

585
01:04:39,129 --> 01:04:40,839
I know.

586
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:47,429
They hurt me.

587
01:04:53,893 --> 01:04:56,271
They won't hurt you again.

588
01:04:57,856 --> 01:05:01,609
They'll never hurt you again.

589
01:05:02,902 --> 01:05:04,863
I promise.

590
01:05:51,326 --> 01:05:56,122
There's no one in the store.
It's only me. Can I help?

591
01:05:56,289 --> 01:05:59,000
I'm meeting a friend.

592
01:05:59,167 --> 01:06:00,627
Out here?

593
01:06:01,711 --> 01:06:03,963
I'm an outdoors type.

594
01:06:06,257 --> 01:06:08,343
It's a dying breed.

595
01:06:11,638 --> 01:06:14,933
You want some coffee while you wait?

596
01:06:15,558 --> 01:06:17,268
Sure, why not?

597
01:06:21,898 --> 01:06:23,525
Thanks.

598
01:06:30,156 --> 01:06:32,158
You know, I'm tired.

599
01:06:33,618 --> 01:06:37,539
- I'm so fucking tired.
- I know what you mean.

600
01:06:41,710 --> 01:06:45,171
You know, you work all your life
to get where you wanna get...

601
01:06:45,922 --> 01:06:48,258
...and like that...

602
01:06:48,883 --> 01:06:50,635
...it's gone.

603
01:06:50,802 --> 01:06:53,346
You look back through
the photo album.

604
01:06:54,681 --> 01:06:56,808
That kid who was you...

605
01:06:57,142 --> 01:07:00,895
...on the football team, he's gone.

606
01:07:02,022 --> 01:07:05,442
The girl you took to Mexico
who you swore you'd love forever...

607
01:07:05,608 --> 01:07:07,318
...she's gone.

608
01:07:08,570 --> 01:07:11,740
The friends who said they'd stick
by you till the end.

609
01:07:13,658 --> 01:07:15,618
The wife...

610
01:07:15,785 --> 01:07:18,079
...and the kids she took away.

611
01:07:19,247 --> 01:07:21,541
Bank loan, business...

612
01:07:23,084 --> 01:07:26,046
...house on the hill, gone.

613
01:07:27,339 --> 01:07:30,884
Castles made of sand, man,
that's all we fucking build.

614
01:07:31,676 --> 01:07:34,220
Castles made of sand.

615
01:07:34,387 --> 01:07:36,765
We're in the right place for that.

616
01:07:39,517 --> 01:07:41,644
And what's your story?

617
01:07:43,646 --> 01:07:45,607
No choice...

618
01:07:46,858 --> 01:07:49,152
...no prospects...

619
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:52,155
...no future.

620
01:07:53,448 --> 01:07:57,619
The past I try to forget about
except when I'm drunk.

621
01:07:58,370 --> 01:08:00,413
Why would you want to forget it?

622
01:08:02,457 --> 01:08:05,752
One day you turn around
and you realize...

623
01:08:08,338 --> 01:08:10,924
...you're only the man you are...

624
01:08:12,592 --> 01:08:15,095
...and not the man you wanted to be.

625
01:08:21,184 --> 01:08:23,311
And what man was that?

626
01:08:25,105 --> 01:08:28,650
It was so long ago
it's hard to remember.

627
01:08:30,026 --> 01:08:34,948
It had something to do
with working the land...

628
01:08:36,408 --> 01:08:38,618
...raising a family...

629
01:08:40,203 --> 01:08:44,416
...having people smile at you
when you walked into a room.

630
01:08:47,252 --> 01:08:50,255
But I came to a fork in the road...

631
01:08:51,339 --> 01:08:53,299
...and made the wrong turn.

632
01:08:54,759 --> 01:08:57,470
It doesn't look like
I'll have time to go back.

633
01:09:01,558 --> 01:09:04,227
It's never too late to change.

634
01:09:05,186 --> 01:09:07,814
Only if you include being dead.

635
01:09:10,525 --> 01:09:13,111
No, that's the one thing
we can count on.

636
01:09:17,115 --> 01:09:20,577
Yeah, sometimes that
thought is a comfort.

637
01:09:42,515 --> 01:09:44,434
You're Burns, right?

638
01:09:45,143 --> 01:09:49,189
St. Francis Xavier Church,
10:00, come alone.

639
01:09:52,525 --> 01:09:54,736
Thanks for the coffee.

640
01:09:55,445 --> 01:09:59,824
It was nice talking with you.

641
01:10:22,347 --> 01:10:24,307
- Yeah?
- Cal.

642
01:10:24,516 --> 01:10:27,727
St. Francis Xavier Church, 10:00.

643
01:10:27,936 --> 01:10:32,565
- You sure you don't want backup?
- No, brother, stay at home.

644
01:11:30,957 --> 01:11:33,168
I'm Eddie Burns.

645
01:11:34,085 --> 01:11:37,213
I come to dance with Charlie Strom.

646
01:11:42,969 --> 01:11:45,221
I'm Charlie Strom.

647
01:11:49,976 --> 01:11:52,270
I'm Charlie Strom.

648
01:11:55,982 --> 01:11:58,318
I'm Charlie Strom.

649
01:12:40,902 --> 01:12:42,737
Motherfucker!

650
01:12:42,904 --> 01:12:45,740
Hold him! Hold him up!

651
01:12:55,083 --> 01:12:56,876
I...

652
01:12:57,335 --> 01:12:59,754
...am Charlie Strom.

653
01:13:00,296 --> 01:13:01,881
Go!

654
01:13:13,601 --> 01:13:16,771
You still don't know what this is about,
do you, Eddie?

655
01:13:16,938 --> 01:13:19,274
You still don't know who I am.

656
01:13:22,277 --> 01:13:25,530
Cal sends his apologies.

657
01:13:40,003 --> 01:13:42,213
Deep breath, Eddie.

658
01:14:05,737 --> 01:14:08,448
You've seen the trailer, Eddie.

659
01:14:10,867 --> 01:14:13,411
Now here's the director's cut.

660
01:14:15,538 --> 01:14:18,416
/You fucked up my life.

661
01:14:19,668 --> 01:14:23,797
/You killed everything
/that ever mattered.

662
01:14:26,424 --> 01:14:30,303
/I want you to die,
/do you understand me?

663
01:14:31,429 --> 01:14:34,349
/I want you to die.

664
01:14:38,937 --> 01:14:40,772
You're not drinking?

665
01:14:42,023 --> 01:14:45,777
I've had enough. You drinking?

666
01:14:46,361 --> 01:14:48,321
Yeah, why not?

667
01:14:54,119 --> 01:14:55,286
You mother...

668
01:15:08,466 --> 01:15:12,762
/Stop it, please! Please, stop!

669
01:15:23,023 --> 01:15:25,275
She was tight, Eddie.

670
01:15:26,609 --> 01:15:29,070
Now, that's how come
she screamed so much.

671
01:15:31,531 --> 01:15:33,742
How we laughed.

672
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:38,288
Oh, how we laughed.

673
01:15:40,331 --> 01:15:42,083
Vincent?

674
01:15:43,877 --> 01:15:45,253
Do it.

675
01:15:46,546 --> 01:15:48,340
You want to know why, don't you?

676
01:15:48,548 --> 01:15:52,844
Even though you're too fucking
stubborn to ask.

677
01:15:57,390 --> 01:15:59,476
No, that would be too easy.

678
01:16:11,029 --> 01:16:13,114
I'll tell you why.

679
01:16:20,455 --> 01:16:22,290
In hell.

680
01:19:43,033 --> 01:19:44,617
Eddie.

681
01:19:54,669 --> 01:19:57,297
I told you not to come, Cal.

682
01:20:01,885 --> 01:20:03,762
Eddie...

683
01:20:05,347 --> 01:20:07,640
...it was us, man.

684
01:20:09,559 --> 01:20:11,436
It was us.

685
01:20:12,937 --> 01:20:14,856
What do you mean?

686
01:20:15,899 --> 01:20:18,735
You and me, man, it was us.

687
01:20:22,238 --> 01:20:24,824
Who is Strom?

688
01:20:28,161 --> 01:20:29,829
Cal?

689
01:20:32,082 --> 01:20:33,750
Cal?

690
01:20:35,502 --> 01:20:37,796
Who is Strom?

691
01:21:01,986 --> 01:21:03,947
I'm sorry.

692
01:21:32,767 --> 01:21:36,021
/Bella, Strom got away.

693
01:21:36,646 --> 01:21:38,940
I need you.

694
01:22:17,103 --> 01:22:21,441
All right. Let me get my motherfucking
money and get the hell...

695
01:22:21,608 --> 01:22:23,318
Shit.

696
01:22:27,947 --> 01:22:29,991
What's up, man?

697
01:22:31,034 --> 01:22:33,495
About the church...

698
01:22:35,330 --> 01:22:36,748
Kneel.

699
01:22:58,228 --> 01:23:01,898
Just keep out of my fucking skull.

700
01:23:02,065 --> 01:23:05,235
Leave me alone.

701
01:23:05,443 --> 01:23:08,613
Leave me alone, Marty.

702
01:23:10,740 --> 01:23:12,575
Marty's dead.

703
01:23:12,742 --> 01:23:14,744
He's dead.

704
01:23:16,204 --> 01:23:19,791
Get out of my fucking skull.

705
01:23:19,958 --> 01:23:22,335
Leave me alone.

706
01:23:44,983 --> 01:23:46,526
Out.

707
01:23:56,161 --> 01:23:59,330
Welcome to the funhouse.

708
01:24:08,089 --> 01:24:10,717
No, that would be too easy.

709
01:24:34,449 --> 01:24:36,910
You tried to kill Kassie.

710
01:24:37,243 --> 01:24:39,162
Yeah, that's right.

711
01:24:40,747 --> 01:24:42,957
I tortured her.

712
01:24:43,958 --> 01:24:46,503
And I shot her full of H.

713
01:24:48,088 --> 01:24:49,547
Do you know how l...?

714
01:24:49,714 --> 01:24:52,050
Do you know how long I've waited?

715
01:24:55,595 --> 01:24:58,807
Do you know how long it took me?

716
01:24:58,973 --> 01:25:01,851
You've been screaming
for your bitch sister...

717
01:25:02,018 --> 01:25:04,562
...for 24 hours.

718
01:25:05,355 --> 01:25:08,733
I've been screaming for fucking years!

719
01:25:13,029 --> 01:25:17,200
You want to know my real name,
Eddie Burns?

720
01:25:17,367 --> 01:25:21,037
It's Kraken. Charlie Kraken.

721
01:25:21,287 --> 01:25:23,415
And my...

722
01:25:23,581 --> 01:25:27,752
My little kid brother?
His name was Marty.

723
01:25:32,257 --> 01:25:34,384
Coming back to you?

724
01:25:35,844 --> 01:25:38,513
Now, Marty was a good kid.

725
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:41,516
He weren't too bright...

726
01:25:41,683 --> 01:25:43,685
...but he was good. He was decent.

727
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:47,564
You had him...

728
01:25:47,731 --> 01:25:51,484
You had him so scared he couldn't
even remember his own fucking name!

729
01:25:51,693 --> 01:25:55,780
- Marty was a cop-killer.
- Marty, he never hurt anybody.

730
01:25:55,989 --> 01:25:58,867
- His prints were on the murder weapon.
- So were mine!

731
01:26:04,330 --> 01:26:06,041
Charlie!

732
01:26:06,416 --> 01:26:07,959
Charlie!

733
01:26:08,126 --> 01:26:11,254
Charlie, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

734
01:26:12,422 --> 01:26:15,300
Marty, get out of my fucking way!

735
01:26:17,510 --> 01:26:20,555
Get out of my fucking way!

736
01:26:26,686 --> 01:26:29,606
Charlie!

737
01:26:29,814 --> 01:26:34,027
Freeze! Drop the weapon!
Oh, you like killing cops?

738
01:26:36,237 --> 01:26:37,655
Eddie, stop!

739
01:26:37,864 --> 01:26:39,783
Eddie, that's enough!

740
01:26:39,949 --> 01:26:42,786
Cop-killer!

741
01:26:53,171 --> 01:26:55,465
So you see, Eddie...

742
01:26:59,094 --> 01:27:01,388
...I'm your cop-killer.

743
01:27:04,349 --> 01:27:06,726
I shot a crooked cop.

744
01:27:07,352 --> 01:27:09,938
You drove an innocent kid...

745
01:27:11,106 --> 01:27:13,441
...to suicide.

746
01:27:21,366 --> 01:27:23,535
Did you...?

747
01:27:23,702 --> 01:27:27,956
Did you help?
Cutting him down?

748
01:27:28,665 --> 01:27:33,336
You help untie the sheet
from around his fucking neck?

749
01:27:37,257 --> 01:27:41,219
Don't you get it, cripple?

750
01:27:41,428 --> 01:27:44,139
Don't you get the fucking picture?!

751
01:27:45,640 --> 01:27:47,809
Perfectly.

752
01:27:48,810 --> 01:27:52,439
You let your little brother
take the rap for you.

753
01:27:53,732 --> 01:27:57,777
But I don't think you see
the picture clearly.

754
01:27:57,986 --> 01:28:02,699
Marty didn't tie that sheet
around his neck because he wanted to.

755
01:28:02,991 --> 01:28:04,993
I was there.

756
01:28:05,994 --> 01:28:08,955
I made him do it.

757
01:28:11,374 --> 01:28:14,294
I watched him die, Charlie.

758
01:28:14,502 --> 01:28:19,007
And I laughed while he pissed in his
dirty little drawers like a bitch.

759
01:28:19,174 --> 01:28:22,510
Oh, how I laughed, Charlie.

760
01:28:23,803 --> 01:28:27,557
See, that's the difference
between you and I.

761
01:28:27,724 --> 01:28:30,185
You have a conscience.

762
01:28:31,603 --> 01:28:33,980
That's your sin...

763
01:28:35,231 --> 01:28:37,150
...not mine.

764
01:28:43,281 --> 01:28:45,283
I forgot to load the weapon.

765
01:28:51,623 --> 01:28:54,334
Eddie, we've got it. Eddie!

766
01:28:54,918 --> 01:28:58,338
Eddie! We don't need this.

767
01:29:26,408 --> 01:29:28,743
Kid, Marty, was innocent.

768
01:29:28,910 --> 01:29:30,662
I know.

769
01:29:31,204 --> 01:29:34,958
- Killed an innocent man.
- Eddie, now is not the time.

770
01:29:43,299 --> 01:29:44,592
Bella, go!

771
01:30:05,989 --> 01:30:07,907
Breathe out.

772
01:30:10,368 --> 01:30:12,203
Come on.

773
01:30:13,913 --> 01:30:16,124
Apply pressure.

774
01:30:16,458 --> 01:30:19,377
Okay. I'll be okay. Go.

775
01:30:52,952 --> 01:30:54,287
Strom!

776
01:35:24,974 --> 01:35:27,519
Bye, Eddie.

777
01:36:31,374 --> 01:36:32,751
Fuck!

778
01:36:59,277 --> 01:37:01,404
Here we are, brother.

779
01:37:03,907 --> 01:37:05,867
Down in hell.

780
01:37:06,034 --> 01:37:08,661
Up to our necks in shit.

781
01:37:09,996 --> 01:37:12,832
We worked for this all our lives.

782
01:37:13,500 --> 01:37:15,710
We deserve it.

783
01:37:16,753 --> 01:37:19,089
But Marty didn't.

784
01:37:22,676 --> 01:37:25,011
Clear his name...

785
01:37:26,888 --> 01:37:29,265
...for both of us.

786
01:38:13,977 --> 01:38:16,104
Pull.

787
01:38:32,287 --> 01:38:34,414
Forget it.

788
01:38:35,707 --> 01:38:38,335
Make it easy on me.

789
01:39:10,367 --> 01:39:12,744
Say after me:

790
01:39:13,203 --> 01:39:17,207
/Death be not proud

791
01:39:20,251 --> 01:39:22,712
Say it to me.

792
01:39:22,879 --> 01:39:27,509
Say it to me.
/Death be not proud

793
01:39:31,554 --> 01:39:34,641
/Death be not proud

794
01:39:34,849 --> 01:39:39,562
/Though some have called thee
/Mighty and dreadful

795
01:39:42,065 --> 01:39:45,443
/Though some have called thee

796
01:39:45,610 --> 01:39:47,987
/Mighty and dreadful

797
01:39:49,364 --> 01:39:52,283
/For thou art not so

798
01:39:56,996 --> 01:39:59,791
/For thou art not so

799
01:41:17,452 --> 01:41:19,496
Captain.

800
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:24,376
- What should I do with this?
- Put me on trial.

801
01:41:25,835 --> 01:41:27,629
Read it, Eddie.

802
01:41:27,837 --> 01:41:30,256
You brought down smack dealers
and pornographers.

803
01:41:31,800 --> 01:41:36,054
If you ran for the governor of Nevada,
you'd probably win. You're a hero.

804
01:41:36,221 --> 01:41:39,933
- And Cal Brody?
- Cal's a hero. Died in the line of duty.

805
01:41:40,100 --> 01:41:42,936
Marty was innocent.

806
01:41:43,103 --> 01:41:45,939
You should've considered
that before you killed him.

807
01:41:46,106 --> 01:41:48,525
I'm going to clear his name, captain.

808
01:41:48,692 --> 01:41:52,529
Do what you have to, but the only
thing I plan on clearing is my desk.

809
01:41:52,696 --> 01:41:57,283
What about your rules? Honesty,
integrity, playing it by the book?

810
01:41:57,450 --> 01:42:00,203
The rules are for me and my men,
they're for cops.

811
01:42:00,370 --> 01:42:05,792
I told you this when you started.
You're not a cop, not anymore.

812
01:42:07,919 --> 01:42:10,839
I'm guilty as sin, captain.

813
01:42:11,006 --> 01:42:13,299
Then live with it.

814
01:42:13,466 --> 01:42:15,802
Case closed.
