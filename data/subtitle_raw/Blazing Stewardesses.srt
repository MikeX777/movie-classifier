1
00:00:03,926 --> 00:00:07,513
(cheerful orchestral music)

2
00:03:29,172 --> 00:03:31,675
(upbeat music)

3
00:03:53,155 --> 00:03:55,741
(tiger roaring)

4
00:04:38,366 --> 00:04:39,117
- Smile.

5
00:04:43,997 --> 00:04:47,125
Well, you finally got
to see L.A. Zoo, Debbie.

6
00:04:47,417 --> 00:04:49,127
- Yeah, it was fun, Lori.

7
00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:52,088
- That's one of the reasons
we're stewerdesses, right,

8
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:55,342
to see places and people?

9
00:04:55,634 --> 00:04:57,260
- Right, Lori.

10
00:04:58,386 --> 00:05:00,305
That reminds me, I gotta go back to my

11
00:05:00,597 --> 00:05:03,350
apartment and get ready
for my next flight.

12
00:05:03,642 --> 00:05:05,268
- And I want to get a birthday present

13
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,145
for my boyfriend, Chuck.

14
00:05:07,437 --> 00:05:10,607
- Chuck, oh he's that
guy from San Francisco.

15
00:05:10,899 --> 00:05:14,528
- The guy, Lori, the guy.

16
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,822
- Oh, he's cute.

17
00:05:17,948 --> 00:05:20,033
Let me drop you off at Olvera Street,

18
00:05:20,325 --> 00:05:22,911
you could get a real nice present there.

19
00:05:23,203 --> 00:05:25,497
J' Would you like for me to

20
00:05:25,789 --> 00:05:29,334

39
00:06:53,251 --> 00:06:56,129
J' Just to look at you, it

40
00:06:56,421 --> 00:07:01,217
J' Do you wanna be with me tonight J'

41
00:07:02,886 --> 00:07:07,766
J' I wanna kiss you, yes I'm

42
00:07:08,558 --> 00:07:09,976
J' In your charm J'

00:07:10,268 --> 00:07:12,604
J' I already miss you, girl J'

44
00:07:12,896 --> 00:07:16,566
J' And I haven't even been in your arm J'

00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:28,870

00:07:33,124 --> 00:07:36,252
J' Do you wanna be with me tonight J'

51
00:07:36,544 --> 00:07:40,423
J' Do you wanna be with me today J'

52
00:08:00,151 --> 00:08:01,820
- This little piggy went to market.

53
00:08:04,114 --> 00:08:06,157
This little piggy stayed home.

54
00:08:09,619 --> 00:08:11,413
This little piggy had roast beef.

55
00:08:14,165 --> 00:08:16,334
This little piggy had none.

56
00:08:19,796 --> 00:08:22,841
And this little piggy
went wee wee wee wee,

57
00:08:23,133 --> 00:08:24,759
all the way home.

58
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,943
- Hey look let's try
something different tonight.

59
00:08:43,611 --> 00:08:45,822
- What do you want me
to do, stand on my head?

60
00:09:03,423 --> 00:09:05,341
- Now this is different.

61
00:09:21,107 --> 00:09:21,858
Pressure.

62
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:52,550
- Chuck.

63
00:11:53,843 --> 00:11:54,594
Chuck?

64
00:11:57,263 --> 00:11:59,015
Chuck, are you asleep?

65
00:12:06,231 --> 00:12:07,523
Chuck?

66
00:12:07,815 --> 00:12:09,275
Chuck, are you here?

67
00:12:15,615 --> 00:12:16,532
You bastard.

68
00:12:18,993 --> 00:12:19,744
- Debbie?

69
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:24,540
Oh shit.

70
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,752
Debbit, Debbie wait a minute.

71
00:12:28,044 --> 00:12:30,088
It's that what you think, Debbie.

72
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:30,922
She's my cousin.

73
00:12:31,214 --> 00:12:31,839
Debbie, Debbie?

74
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,260
Debbie, Debbie, Debbie.

75
00:12:37,262 --> 00:12:40,181
Debbie, wait a minute,
it's not what you think.

76
00:12:41,933 --> 00:12:45,061
- Stick this with the rest of them.

77
00:12:46,521 --> 00:12:48,898
Maybe this'll cool off your hot pants.

78
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,686
(phone ringing)

79
00:13:38,197 --> 00:13:39,532
Yeah?

80
00:13:39,824 --> 00:13:42,076
- [Ben] It's Ben Brewster.

81
00:13:42,368 --> 00:13:43,077
' Who?

82
00:13:43,369 --> 00:13:46,331
- It's Ben, Ben Brewster, how are you?

83
00:13:47,915 --> 00:13:50,084
- Look Ben, this is a bad time to call.

84
00:13:50,376 --> 00:13:52,086
Do you think you could
call me later, please?

85
00:13:52,378 --> 00:13:54,172
- Now look Debbie, this
is strictly business.

86
00:13:54,464 --> 00:13:55,131
Nothing personal.

87
00:13:55,423 --> 00:13:57,759
I've got a charter coming out to my ranch.

88
00:13:58,051 --> 00:13:59,510
Now if you and your friends are free,

89
00:13:59,802 --> 00:14:01,763
you could work the flight for good money

90
00:14:02,055 --> 00:14:04,474
and a two week vacation on the house.

91
00:14:04,766 --> 00:14:05,725
Now how does that sound?

92
00:14:06,768 --> 00:14:10,438
- Hey, it really sounds
like a good idea, Ben.

93
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:15,276
I'd like to, thank you, bye.

94
00:14:29,665 --> 00:14:32,168
(upbeat music)

95
00:14:40,093 --> 00:14:42,678
(phone ringing)

96
00:14:48,226 --> 00:14:50,478
- Hello, who's there?

97
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:51,479
- [Debbie] Debbie.

98
00:14:51,771 --> 00:14:53,648
- Debbie, hi, how are ya?

99
00:14:55,024 --> 00:14:55,942
How's Chuck?

100
00:14:58,319 --> 00:14:59,070
Oh.

101
00:15:04,575 --> 00:15:05,326
Oh.

102
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:14,377
- I got a call from an old friend of mine.

103
00:15:14,669 --> 00:15:16,087
He's invited me and a couple of friends

104
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:18,840
for a free two week
vacation at his dude ranch.

105
00:15:19,132 --> 00:15:19,966
- A ranch?

106
00:15:20,258 --> 00:15:21,217
With horsies?

107
00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:23,970
- Yes, but he wants us
to have a junket flight.

108
00:15:24,262 --> 00:15:26,472
He's putting in a gambling casino.

109
00:15:26,764 --> 00:15:29,892
- Gambling, that's naughty.

110
00:15:30,184 --> 00:15:33,020
- Be at the Mountain Airline
counter at 8:00 tonight.

111
00:15:33,312 --> 00:15:34,480
That's where we'll meet the man.

112
00:15:34,772 --> 00:15:36,149
- Man, that's nice.

113
00:15:38,818 --> 00:15:41,571
- Now Lauren, I want you to be good.

114
00:15:41,863 --> 00:15:43,948
- Oh, I'll be good.

115
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,366
I'm always good.

116
00:15:47,118 --> 00:15:48,035
- Promise?

117
00:15:48,327 --> 00:15:48,870
- I promise.

118
00:15:49,162 --> 00:15:50,955
- Okay, I'll see you at the airport.

119
00:15:51,247 --> 00:15:52,623
- Okay, bye Debbie.

120
00:16:10,725 --> 00:16:13,561
(orchestral music)

121
00:16:52,433 --> 00:16:54,936
- You work for Brewster's
Lucky Dollar Ranch?

122
00:16:55,228 --> 00:16:56,229
- What do you guys want?

123
00:17:10,284 --> 00:17:12,411
- This is gonna happen to anybody working

124
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,247
for the Lucky Dollar.

125
00:19:12,448 --> 00:19:14,700
(screaming)

126
00:19:26,671 --> 00:19:29,173
(upbeat music)

127
00:19:44,563 --> 00:19:45,314
" Ben?

128
00:19:47,066 --> 00:19:48,734
You're gonna pluck them
clean just as soon as

129
00:19:49,026 --> 00:19:50,319
the gambling starts, huh?

130
00:19:50,611 --> 00:19:51,237
- It could be.

131
00:19:52,822 --> 00:19:54,240
- Now come on you old fox.

132
00:19:54,532 --> 00:19:56,951
You've got a gold mine
here and you know it.

133
00:19:57,243 --> 00:19:59,161
I just hope you believe
in sharing the wealth.

134
00:19:59,453 --> 00:20:00,413
- Meaning?

135
00:20:00,705 --> 00:20:03,374
- Well meaning I hope you're
not gonna be selfish about it.

136
00:20:04,417 --> 00:20:06,293
- Now look, Trask, you're a foreman here,

137
00:20:06,585 --> 00:20:09,255
but I'm running this operation
and don't you forget it.

138
00:20:09,547 --> 00:20:10,631
Now if you don't like it here--

139
00:20:10,923 --> 00:20:11,757
- Wait a minute, Ben.

140
00:20:12,049 --> 00:20:13,050
- No, no, you wait.

141
00:20:21,851 --> 00:20:23,644
- Like to get your hands
on that wouldn't you?

142
00:20:23,936 --> 00:20:24,979
Well eat your heart out old-timer,

143
00:20:25,271 --> 00:20:26,856
you haven't got a chance.

144
00:20:27,148 --> 00:20:28,941
She buys and sells guys like you.

145
00:20:29,233 --> 00:20:31,193
She buys them cheap
and sells them cheaper.

146
00:20:32,778 --> 00:20:33,696
- Don't bet on it.

147
00:20:38,409 --> 00:20:40,161
- You two at it again?

148
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,497
- Oh it's nothing unusual.

149
00:20:43,789 --> 00:20:46,167
We're all a little bit
edgy after last night.

150
00:20:46,459 --> 00:20:47,626
- Oh I heard about that.

151
00:20:48,836 --> 00:20:52,131
Can you believe it, hooded riders.

152
00:20:52,423 --> 00:20:53,883
Somebody's been watching
too many late movies.

153
00:20:54,175 --> 00:20:56,135
Anything I can do to help, Ben?

154
00:20:56,427 --> 00:20:58,971
- No Honey, but it was nice of you to ask.

155
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,890
That's what neighbors are for,

156
00:21:01,182 --> 00:21:02,933
besides I have a special interest here.

157
00:21:10,316 --> 00:21:12,985
Ben, you sure you can trust him?

158
00:21:13,903 --> 00:21:14,820
- Frankly, no.

159
00:21:15,821 --> 00:21:19,116
Hey you know Honey, maybe
I ought to try your racket.

160
00:21:19,408 --> 00:21:23,245
- Ben Brewster, you don't
have my natural talents.

161
00:21:23,537 --> 00:21:24,497
- Well that's for sure.

162
00:21:28,918 --> 00:21:31,504
(Playful music)

163
00:21:36,675 --> 00:21:38,010
- Hey, hey, here.

164
00:21:38,928 --> 00:21:40,054
Hey, let's do the leg thing.

165
00:21:40,346 --> 00:21:42,723
- The leg thing, the leg thing.

166
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:50,022
- It's your leg, it's a bad leg.

167
00:21:50,314 --> 00:21:51,273
Hey, hey.

168
00:21:51,565 --> 00:21:54,735
Get off, get off.

169
00:22:05,412 --> 00:22:08,582
Here's another one, I got it, I got it.

170
00:22:10,084 --> 00:22:11,085
_ Help, help.

171
00:22:13,045 --> 00:22:14,296
Over here, help.

172
00:22:42,741 --> 00:22:44,743
- Hey, wait a minute.

173
00:22:45,035 --> 00:22:45,828
Help wanted.

174
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,455
Lucky Dollar Guest Ranch, five miles.

175
00:22:48,747 --> 00:22:49,582
- Well, let's give it a shot.

176
00:22:49,874 --> 00:22:50,499
We might get lucky

177
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:52,585
- Let's go up there, come on.

178
00:23:00,426 --> 00:23:02,928
(upbeat music)

179
00:23:19,486 --> 00:23:21,864
- Hello, are you enjoying your flight?

180
00:23:22,156 --> 00:23:23,240
Good.

181
00:23:23,532 --> 00:23:24,909
Hello, I've got your drink.

182
00:23:28,203 --> 00:23:28,871
- Thank you.

183
00:23:29,163 --> 00:23:29,705
- Good.

184
00:23:29,997 --> 00:23:30,581
Hello, how are you today?

185
00:23:30,873 --> 00:23:34,126
Oh, I know what you want, there you are.

186
00:23:34,418 --> 00:23:35,961
And of course, to make it real, real good,

187
00:23:36,253 --> 00:23:37,254
that goes with it.

188
00:23:38,213 --> 00:23:39,965
Oh, you little rascal.

189
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:45,179
Hi, whoops, hello.

190
00:23:46,972 --> 00:23:49,433
Hello, hello, can I get you a drink?

191
00:23:50,643 --> 00:23:52,728
There you are, there you are.

192
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:55,689
And what would you like?

193
00:23:55,981 --> 00:24:00,194
Oh, no you can't have that,
but you can have this.

194
00:24:00,486 --> 00:24:01,528
Hi.

195
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:02,446
- Miss.

196
00:24:03,697 --> 00:24:05,074
- Hi.

197
00:24:05,366 --> 00:24:05,908
- Hey I'm really glad
you guys could make it.

198
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,953
I hope this trip isn't a mistake.

199
00:24:09,244 --> 00:24:10,746
- Where there's men, money, and action

200
00:24:11,038 --> 00:24:12,915
it's never a mistake.

201
00:24:13,207 --> 00:24:15,542
- She meant that Brewster's
just another rich old man.

202
00:24:15,834 --> 00:24:18,921
- But some rich older men are lots of fun.

203
00:24:19,213 --> 00:24:21,715
It depends what angle you view it from.

204
00:24:22,007 --> 00:24:23,342
Horizontal or vertical.

205
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,181
- A lady never tells,

206
00:24:29,473 --> 00:24:31,600
at least that's what the ladies tell me.

207
00:24:31,892 --> 00:24:32,518
- [Man] Miss.

208
00:24:37,189 --> 00:24:41,110
- Well, I once knew rich old men in Miami.

209
00:24:41,402 --> 00:24:45,155
$1,000 a month penthouse, four cars,

210
00:24:45,447 --> 00:24:50,160
and he didn't even charge me
and my girlfriend any rent.

211
00:24:51,203 --> 00:24:53,497
- And he treated you like a father.

212
00:24:53,789 --> 00:24:55,082
- But how do you know?

213
00:24:55,374 --> 00:24:57,251
He had me call him daddy.

214
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,838
- And I bet only wanted
to do was to spank you.

215
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:03,757
- Oh, you know him too, huh?

216
00:25:13,434 --> 00:25:15,519
- Well say Debbie,
what's the story on this?

217
00:25:15,811 --> 00:25:19,481
- You know, it's like
the free trips to Vegas.

218
00:25:19,773 --> 00:25:22,151
We get the big spenders to
roll their money at the tables.

219
00:25:22,443 --> 00:25:23,485
That's all.

220
00:25:23,777 --> 00:25:26,405
- No one can ever accuse
Brewster of not having an angle.

221
00:25:27,448 --> 00:25:29,033
Oops, a customer.

222
00:25:31,285 --> 00:25:33,245
- And I have a pilot
waiting for me who needs

223
00:25:33,537 --> 00:25:35,581
some encouragement, S€€ YOU.

224
00:25:39,418 --> 00:25:41,920
- Lori, what are we gonna do for fun now?

225
00:25:42,212 --> 00:25:43,338
- With a plane full of men?

226
00:25:47,134 --> 00:25:50,929
- Wow, I see someone interesting, later.

227
00:25:53,932 --> 00:25:56,810
- Whoops, whoops, oh.

228
00:25:57,102 --> 00:25:57,728
- Miss.

229
00:26:00,439 --> 00:26:01,190
Miss?

230
00:26:02,357 --> 00:26:04,068
- Your coffee, sir.

231
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:07,237
- Excuse me miss, where's the restroom?

232
00:26:07,529 --> 00:26:08,781
- To the rear of the plane, sir.

233
00:26:09,073 --> 00:26:09,698
- Thank you.

234
00:26:10,866 --> 00:26:11,992
- Watch your step.

235
00:26:17,748 --> 00:26:18,624
- Thank you.

236
00:26:18,916 --> 00:26:19,875
- Hi, I'm Debbie.

237
00:26:20,167 --> 00:26:21,335
What's your name?

238
00:26:21,627 --> 00:26:24,588
- Bob, Bob Travers.

239
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,173
- I think I'll call you Bobby.

240
00:26:28,175 --> 00:26:30,761
Let's get acquainted,
tell me about yourself.

241
00:26:32,888 --> 00:26:35,349
- I don't usually like
to talk about myself.

242
00:26:35,641 --> 00:26:37,142
- Okay I'll tell you about myself.

243
00:26:38,769 --> 00:26:39,853
- That would be much nicer.

244
00:26:40,145 --> 00:26:42,272
- Well I was sold to white slavers,

245
00:26:42,564 --> 00:26:47,361
but my wicked stepfather
when I was only 5 years old.

246
00:26:53,659 --> 00:26:54,409
- Hi guys.

247
00:27:18,392 --> 00:27:21,770
Hey, listen guys, I don't really need you.

248
00:27:22,062 --> 00:27:24,231
There's lots of action
back there, you know.

249
00:27:25,232 --> 00:27:27,234
- No Jackie, we need you up here.

250
00:27:34,741 --> 00:27:37,661
- Well since you guys seem to
have everything under control,

251
00:27:38,662 --> 00:27:40,247
I'll go check the Bombay.

252
00:27:41,248 --> 00:27:42,499
- But you're bomb already.

253
00:27:44,459 --> 00:27:47,004
- This isn't the high
and mighty, you know.

254
00:27:47,296 --> 00:27:51,216
After all it takes guts
to fly in this war.

255
00:27:51,508 --> 00:27:52,634
- I know, I know.

256
00:27:52,926 --> 00:27:55,012
Just bring me a Cutty
Sark, will you, please?

257
00:27:56,555 --> 00:27:58,432
- And watch the zeroes.

258
00:27:58,724 --> 00:28:02,186
They like to sneak in out of the sun.

259
00:28:02,477 --> 00:28:03,520
- Get lost, will ya?

260
00:28:15,866 --> 00:28:17,910
Oh what a way to be flowing on the job.

261
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,833
- Are we coming on schedule?

262
00:28:26,627 --> 00:28:29,421
- Making outwith you, you
I think I'm losing my head.

263
00:28:29,713 --> 00:28:32,132
- When are you going to
bring the landing gear down?

264
00:28:34,134 --> 00:28:36,678
J' They had only one more time J'

265
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:40,807
J' They had only one more time J'

266
00:28:41,099 --> 00:28:44,853
J' They had only one more time J'

267
00:28:45,145 --> 00:28:47,481
(upbeat music)

268
00:28:59,117 --> 00:29:01,703
(Playful music)

269
00:29:36,238 --> 00:29:38,031
- Say Captain, are we on time?

270
00:29:42,744 --> 00:29:45,664
- He's about a quarter of the three.

271
00:29:50,877 --> 00:29:53,463
(sensual music)

272
00:31:21,343 --> 00:31:22,469
- And then I joined a gang of girls,

273
00:31:22,761 --> 00:31:25,180
and then we made an oath
in blood and it was awful.

274
00:31:27,015 --> 00:31:30,519
I'm only joking with you,
I'm just putting you on.

275
00:31:31,853 --> 00:31:34,898
- Yes I know.

276
00:31:37,567 --> 00:31:38,777
That must be turbulence.

277
00:31:40,153 --> 00:31:41,405
Everything's okay, isn't it?

278
00:31:41,696 --> 00:31:44,074
- Don't worry, it's only Jackie.

279
00:31:45,742 --> 00:31:46,493
- Jackie?

280
00:32:08,807 --> 00:32:09,933
- Emergency.

281
00:32:10,225 --> 00:32:12,644
Give me a tall scotch in a short water.

282
00:32:12,936 --> 00:32:16,648
- Oh, you're flying higher
than we are already.

283
00:32:19,151 --> 00:32:22,279
- Near turbulence, just turbulence.

284
00:32:22,571 --> 00:32:23,280
Where's yours.

285
00:32:24,406 --> 00:32:25,073
- You kidding?

286
00:32:25,365 --> 00:32:28,493
You went for a booze down at
drunken Indian, now would ya?

287
00:32:36,418 --> 00:32:37,586
Oh my goodness.

288
00:32:38,712 --> 00:32:41,715
Oh Debbie, Debbie.

289
00:32:42,007 --> 00:32:44,676
Oh, you're making any luck, aren't you?

290
00:32:44,968 --> 00:32:46,178
Jimmy, stop it, stop it.

291
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:49,139
Jimmy, Jimmy, here, here, here.

292
00:32:49,431 --> 00:32:52,184
Now you take this to
somebody who needs it, okay?

293
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,984
- Open up, open UP-

294
00:33:02,652 --> 00:33:04,529
This is your captain speaking.

295
00:33:07,908 --> 00:33:10,368
AI, AI.

296
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:14,748
- Okay, but wrestling's off limits.

297
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:15,749
- Hold this.

298
00:33:19,461 --> 00:33:20,253
It's really stuck.

299
00:33:22,255 --> 00:33:23,465
- Well, pull it.

300
00:33:23,757 --> 00:33:24,716
- I'm pulling it.

301
00:33:27,761 --> 00:33:32,682
- Here.

302
00:33:43,568 --> 00:33:44,736
- Turbulence.

303
00:33:45,028 --> 00:33:45,904
- No, Jackie.

304
00:33:49,908 --> 00:33:52,536
- Oh, I wanted to get you alone.

305
00:33:52,827 --> 00:33:55,539
- I knew it, it's a bad, bad dream.

306
00:33:57,582 --> 00:33:59,167
You let me help you.

307
00:34:07,092 --> 00:34:09,636
Yeah, oh let me get your little button.

308
00:34:09,928 --> 00:34:11,888
Oh, the one little button.

309
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,275
Oh, now your tie.

310
00:34:35,996 --> 00:34:39,332
- Get me out of this, get me out of this.

311
00:34:50,969 --> 00:34:52,470
Get me out of this.

312
00:34:53,972 --> 00:34:55,473
Get me out of this.

313
00:35:00,812 --> 00:35:01,646
Get me out.

314
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,874
- I don't mean to make anybody nervous,

315
00:35:21,166 --> 00:35:24,252
but who's flying the plane?

316
00:35:36,806 --> 00:35:39,100
(soft music)

317
00:35:52,197 --> 00:35:54,574
- Well folks welcome to
the Lucky Dollar Ranch.

318
00:36:00,538 --> 00:36:02,290
- Hi, hello.

319
00:36:02,582 --> 00:36:03,375
Have a good time now

320
00:36:05,919 --> 00:36:07,796
Hey, Honey come here a minute.

321
00:36:10,256 --> 00:36:12,884
I want you to meet the
girls I told you about.

322
00:36:13,176 --> 00:36:14,344
- New recruits?

323
00:36:14,636 --> 00:36:16,179
- I say it's more like competition.

324
00:36:19,432 --> 00:36:21,768
Girls I want you to meet Honey Morgan.

325
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,645
Honey, this is Debbie Stewart,

326
00:36:23,937 --> 00:36:25,772
Barbara Watson, Lori Winters,

327
00:36:26,064 --> 00:36:26,606
- Hi.

328
00:36:26,898 --> 00:36:28,358
- Hello girls, welcome.

329
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:32,654
Well now, we want you to
have a good time and relax.

330
00:36:32,946 --> 00:36:34,447
Ben here's an old friend of mine

331
00:36:34,739 --> 00:36:35,949
and I'm gonna take care of you.

332
00:36:36,241 --> 00:36:37,617
- Just like a mother, huh.

333
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:42,831
- Exactly.

334
00:36:44,249 --> 00:36:45,834
Rodeo starts in about an hour.

335
00:36:46,126 --> 00:36:47,210
We're gonna have a high old time.

336
00:36:47,502 --> 00:36:50,964
- Oh, a rodeo, terrific.

337
00:36:51,256 --> 00:36:52,215
Here's Bobby.

338
00:36:53,216 --> 00:36:53,967
- Hello.

339
00:36:55,051 --> 00:36:56,344
- Bobby, I'd like to
introduce you to Honey Morgan

340
00:36:56,636 --> 00:36:57,429
and Ben Brewster.

341
00:36:57,721 --> 00:36:58,430
- Hi.

342
00:36:58,722 --> 00:36:59,347
- Hello.

343
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,686
- Come on girls I'll
show you to your room.

344
00:37:04,978 --> 00:37:07,188
Now we need a pretty girl
to ride in the parade.

345
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,565
Any takers?

346
00:37:08,857 --> 00:37:09,774
- Listen, I'd love to.

347
00:37:10,066 --> 00:37:11,192
I've been taking riding lessons.

348
00:37:11,484 --> 00:37:14,237
- Your first time out West Bobby?

349
00:37:14,529 --> 00:37:17,198
- Not really, I get around quite a lot.

350
00:37:18,283 --> 00:37:20,118
- I bet you do.

351
00:37:21,161 --> 00:37:23,204
Well I think you'll find
people real friendly

352
00:37:23,496 --> 00:37:24,873
in this neck of the woods.

353
00:37:25,165 --> 00:37:26,666
- That's very nice.

354
00:37:26,958 --> 00:37:27,709
- Could be nicer.

355
00:37:28,752 --> 00:37:31,921
If things become too quiet at Brewster's,

356
00:37:32,213 --> 00:37:35,467
why don't you stop by the
Beehive and say hello.

357
00:37:36,843 --> 00:37:40,638
Beehive, Honey, dig?

358
00:37:42,056 --> 00:37:43,975
- Thank you, not ma'am.

359
00:37:44,267 --> 00:37:46,060
- Oh, not ma'am, madame.

360
00:38:27,644 --> 00:38:29,646
J' Getting back to Georgia J'

00:38:29,938 --> 00:38:32,190
J' Gonna pull myself together J'

362
00:38:32,482 --> 00:38:37,278
J' And I hope your heart
will let me stay around J'

363
00:38:37,987 --> 00:38:40,323
J' 'Cause without you I got nothing J'

364
00:38:40,615 --> 00:38:43,284
J' Are you gonna put me down J'

365
00:38:43,576 --> 00:38:48,373
J' Have I lost the day I found J'

366
00:38:48,915 --> 00:38:53,378
J' Can you realize that I've changed J'

367
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:57,549
J' And my plans didn't work out right J'

368
00:38:57,841 --> 00:39:00,760
J' But they're over now J'

369
00:39:01,052 --> 00:39:05,807
J' I'll admit I tried not
to think of you, love J'

370
00:39:06,099 --> 00:39:10,937
J' But the thought of you was too strong J'

371
00:39:11,688 --> 00:39:14,274
J' Getting back to Georgia J'

372
00:39:14,566 --> 00:39:17,569
J' Gonna pull myself together J'

373
00:39:17,861 --> 00:39:22,657
J' And I hope your heart
will let me stay around J'

374
00:39:23,116 --> 00:39:25,785
J' 'Cause without you I've got nothing J'

375
00:39:26,077 --> 00:39:28,830
J' Are you gonna put me down J'

376
00:39:29,122 --> 00:39:33,918
J' Have I lost the day I found J'

377
00:39:34,252 --> 00:39:39,173
J' Have I lost the day I found J'

378
00:39:39,841 --> 00:39:43,595
J' Have I lost the day I found J'

379
00:40:00,612 --> 00:40:02,030
- Barbara, Debbie.

380
00:40:05,074 --> 00:40:06,618
Hi, you guys.

381
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:09,329
Hey, come on and teach
me how to play some golf.

382
00:40:09,621 --> 00:40:11,164
- Lori, we don't even
know how to play golf.

383
00:40:11,456 --> 00:40:14,292
- Oh, she just wants to
teach us a new way to swing.

384
00:40:14,584 --> 00:40:16,502
- Ha ha, well, come on.

385
00:40:16,794 --> 00:40:18,171
I'll teach you guys then.

386
00:40:18,463 --> 00:40:20,590
I see them play it on TV
all the time, come on.

387
00:40:22,342 --> 00:40:23,635
- What about the rodeo?

388
00:40:23,927 --> 00:40:24,761
- [Lori] We got time.

389
00:40:26,012 --> 00:40:27,513
- Play them all, I'm hungry.

390
00:40:27,805 --> 00:40:29,682
- That's not how you play golf.

391
00:40:30,683 --> 00:40:32,018
- That's baseball.

392
00:40:34,312 --> 00:40:35,647
- Yeah, that's right.

393
00:40:37,315 --> 00:40:38,483
- Playing golf, eh?

394
00:40:38,775 --> 00:40:40,652
- No, they're playing basketball.

395
00:40:40,944 --> 00:40:43,196
- Don't be a wise guy, will you.

396
00:40:43,488 --> 00:40:46,532
Now look, let me show you how
to address the ball, right.

397
00:40:46,824 --> 00:40:50,453
Now you hold, just bend over a little.

398
00:40:52,455 --> 00:40:54,207
Just, I'll tell you.

399
00:40:54,499 --> 00:40:57,168
Hold this little this stiff, you see?

400
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:00,213
This arm, oh boy.

401
00:41:00,505 --> 00:41:01,422
Hold this arm very stiff.

402
00:41:01,714 --> 00:41:03,132
Arm, hold it, that's it.

403
00:41:03,424 --> 00:41:05,927
Now and this leg also has to be stiff.

404
00:41:06,219 --> 00:41:08,471
Come back, that's it you see.

405
00:41:08,763 --> 00:41:09,597
That's it.

406
00:41:09,889 --> 00:41:13,226
And this arm has to be stiff.

407
00:41:13,518 --> 00:41:16,729
And this leg has to be stiff.

408
00:41:17,021 --> 00:41:17,772
You don't mind, do you?

409
00:41:18,064 --> 00:41:18,856
- No.

410
00:41:19,148 --> 00:41:21,567
- But he does, so don't forget.

411
00:41:21,859 --> 00:41:26,614
This arm stiff and this leg is also stiff.

412
00:41:26,906 --> 00:41:29,701
Now, come back very slow.

413
00:41:29,993 --> 00:41:32,078
Wait, I'll tell you what you do.

414
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:34,330
You stand over there and I'll show you how

415
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:36,958
to hit the ball, right.

416
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:38,334
- These are two handicap.

417
00:41:45,008 --> 00:41:47,593
(Playful music)

418
00:41:50,638 --> 00:41:53,057
- It slipped, I'm sorry.

419
00:41:55,184 --> 00:41:56,352
Le me try it again.

420
00:41:56,644 --> 00:41:57,770
- He's a two handicap.

421
00:42:29,802 --> 00:42:31,971
Will you hit the damn ball.

422
00:42:46,069 --> 00:42:48,071
He's a 22 handicap.

423
00:42:50,448 --> 00:42:53,159
- Let's go to the next tee.

424
00:42:56,037 --> 00:42:57,663
- Here we go again.

425
00:42:57,955 --> 00:42:59,916
Hey, that's our golf club.

426
00:45:15,718 --> 00:45:17,637
- No, you gotta stay on.

427
00:45:18,596 --> 00:45:21,098
You're not allowed to fall off.

428
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:58,427
Leave him alone, you get nervous.

429
00:45:58,719 --> 00:45:59,804
Tanks, I said Tanks.

430
00:46:01,806 --> 00:46:02,932
Oh, Tanks.

431
00:46:03,224 --> 00:46:06,060
Tanks, you've got to stay on, I'm sorry.

432
00:46:06,352 --> 00:46:08,396
Tanks, stay on, damn you.

433
00:46:12,858 --> 00:46:14,151
Now he hears me.

434
00:46:14,443 --> 00:46:16,404
Maybe he likes my dialect.

435
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:35,006
(applauding)

436
00:46:37,174 --> 00:46:39,260
Ride him, ride him, Tanks.

437
00:46:40,344 --> 00:46:43,264
Atta boy, hey Jacks, keep going man.

438
00:46:43,556 --> 00:46:45,516
- How do you know it's Tanks?

439
00:46:47,059 --> 00:46:48,853
- I know its Tanks.

440
00:46:49,145 --> 00:46:49,854
And you know, I feel
bad for him, you know?

441
00:46:50,146 --> 00:46:50,855
- Why, Wm'?

442
00:46:51,147 --> 00:46:51,856
- I got his underwear this morning.

443
00:46:52,148 --> 00:46:52,857
Oh, he's in a tight spot.

444
00:46:53,149 --> 00:46:53,858
Hey, Tanks.

445
00:47:27,141 --> 00:47:28,309
- What's the matter, sweetheart?

446
00:47:28,601 --> 00:47:31,145
You look down in the mouth,
not enjoying the rodeo?

447
00:47:32,521 --> 00:47:33,731
- Oh nothing's wrong.

448
00:47:34,899 --> 00:47:38,027
- Oh come on, you can lay it
on the line with mama Morgan.

449
00:47:39,487 --> 00:47:44,116
- Well, you see I rented
this new apartment back east,

450
00:47:44,408 --> 00:47:47,328
but the people who live there
didn't move out in time.

451
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:51,248
So I let them stay
there and I got a motel.

452
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:52,458
- That was nice of you.

453
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:54,710
- But that was three months ago,

454
00:47:55,002 --> 00:47:57,505
and they still haven't paid the rent.

455
00:47:57,797 --> 00:48:02,093
And now I owe for my rent
and I owe on my car payment,

456
00:48:02,385 --> 00:48:05,930
and I owe for my motel and
I don't know where I'm going

457
00:48:06,222 --> 00:48:07,181
to get the money.

458
00:48:08,641 --> 00:48:10,518
- Lori you came to the right person.

459
00:48:11,769 --> 00:48:13,729
You heard about my place, the Beehive?

460
00:48:14,021 --> 00:48:17,650
- Oh, the Beehive, Ben told us about that.

461
00:48:17,942 --> 00:48:18,484
It's a--

462
00:48:18,776 --> 00:48:19,985
- It's a gold mine.

463
00:48:20,277 --> 00:48:21,654
You need money?

464
00:48:21,946 --> 00:48:24,448
You're not alone, lots of girls come over

465
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:27,201
and work a few days, make a few dollars.

466
00:48:27,493 --> 00:48:29,370
Stewardesses too.

467
00:48:29,662 --> 00:48:31,372
Why give it away?

468
00:48:33,290 --> 00:48:38,212
- Oh I couldn't do that,
but I'll think about it.

469
00:48:42,675 --> 00:48:45,177
(upbeat music)

470
00:49:24,508 --> 00:49:25,676
- Yes, ma'am.

471
00:49:25,968 --> 00:49:27,344
- Hot dog, please.

472
00:49:27,636 --> 00:49:29,013
- Hot dog.
- Hot dog, why of course.

473
00:49:31,348 --> 00:49:32,349
- Thank you.

474
00:49:32,641 --> 00:49:33,267
- Hamburger, please.

475
00:49:33,559 --> 00:49:34,935
- Hamburger.
- hamburger, sure.

476
00:49:36,812 --> 00:49:38,939
Hamburger for the
gentleman, there you are.

477
00:49:40,065 --> 00:49:41,358
- Fried egg sandwich, please.

478
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:44,570
- Fried egg, fried egg sandwich?

479
00:49:44,862 --> 00:49:46,572
Make him a fried egg sandwich.

480
00:49:46,864 --> 00:49:48,282
Comes in here with a fried egg sandwich,

481
00:49:48,574 --> 00:49:50,659
he has to make a fried egg sandwich.

482
00:49:50,951 --> 00:49:52,745
- You give him a fried egg.

483
00:49:53,037 --> 00:49:54,663
But you'll have to let me
know when they're done.

484
00:49:54,955 --> 00:49:56,290
- I'll give you a count down.

485
00:49:56,582 --> 00:49:57,208
_ okay-

486
00:50:09,178 --> 00:50:10,429
- One.

487
00:50:10,721 --> 00:50:11,722
Two.

488
00:50:12,014 --> 00:50:12,640
Three.

489
00:50:13,682 --> 00:50:15,017
Foun

490
00:50:15,309 --> 00:50:16,644
Five.

491
00:50:16,936 --> 00:50:18,020
Six.

492
00:50:18,312 --> 00:50:19,522
Seven.

493
00:50:19,813 --> 00:50:20,689
Eight.

494
00:50:20,981 --> 00:50:21,690
Nine.

495
00:50:21,982 --> 00:50:22,733
One.

496
00:50:23,025 --> 00:50:23,651
Ten.

497
00:50:24,652 --> 00:50:25,319
- They're done.

498
00:50:25,611 --> 00:50:26,362
- Good, let him have it.

499
00:50:40,251 --> 00:50:42,586
Don't you know what you're doing?

500
00:50:47,591 --> 00:50:50,469
- I want to welcome you all
to the Lucky Dollar Ranch.

501
00:50:51,387 --> 00:50:54,515
I'm Honey Morgan, your
friend and neighbor.

502
00:50:54,807 --> 00:50:58,060
Ben Brewster asked me to
act as sort of a hostess

503
00:50:58,352 --> 00:51:01,146
and provide a little entertainment.

504
00:51:01,438 --> 00:51:04,316
Most of you know that I'm
pretty good at hostessing,

505
00:51:06,193 --> 00:51:08,571
and as far as the entertainment goes,

506
00:51:08,862 --> 00:51:10,781
well you could be the judge of that.

507
00:51:13,867 --> 00:51:16,203
(soft music)

508
00:51:18,497 --> 00:51:23,419
J' Oh it was easy J'

509
00:51:24,461 --> 00:51:29,341
J' So very easy J'

510
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:35,097
J' To run around and
cause you all the pain J'

511
00:51:35,931 --> 00:51:38,392
J' Our friends all left behind your back J'

512
00:51:38,684 --> 00:51:43,480
J' When I became a clown they
never said a word to me J'

513
00:51:44,231 --> 00:51:49,153
J' They always put you down J'

514
00:51:50,362 --> 00:51:55,284
J' The things that I needed J'

515
00:51:56,785 --> 00:52:01,582
J' There beyond our door J'

516
00:52:01,874 --> 00:52:06,587
J' I found them all and
tried them on for size J'

517
00:52:06,879 --> 00:52:09,548
J' You told me that they wouldn't fit J'

518
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:12,468
J' And I called you a name J'

519
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:15,304
J' You didn't cry, I wondered why J'

520
00:52:15,596 --> 00:52:18,557
J' I thought it was a game J'

521
00:52:18,849 --> 00:52:23,646
J' Now the game is over J'

522
00:52:24,188 --> 00:52:29,109
J' And I've added up the score J'

523
00:52:29,777 --> 00:52:34,698
J'All I ever needed is
standing in this door J'

524
00:52:47,169 --> 00:52:51,590
J' Oh it was easy J'

525
00:52:51,882 --> 00:52:56,679
J' So very easy J'

526
00:52:57,513 --> 00:53:02,142
J' You stay away and make you stay alone J'

527
00:53:02,434 --> 00:53:04,937
J' The price was right and it was fun J'

528
00:53:05,229 --> 00:53:07,731
J' While living in the sky J'

529
00:53:08,023 --> 00:53:12,820
J' But when I fell I hit so hard
the price became too high J'

530
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:18,492
J' Now the game is over J'

531
00:53:19,076 --> 00:53:23,997
J' And I've added up the score J'

532
00:53:24,581 --> 00:53:29,503
J'All I ever needed is
standing in this door J'

533
00:53:33,632 --> 00:53:38,554
J' Yes all the time the

534
00:53:40,305 --> 00:53:45,227
J' Was to hold you in
my arms, to be there J'

535
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:49,231
J' To be close J'

536
00:53:49,523 --> 00:53:54,319
J' ls it fair for me to
ask that you forgive J'

537
00:53:56,363 --> 00:54:01,285
J' My wandering and believe I
changed my life, well I have J'

538
00:54:04,288 --> 00:54:09,042
J' And it's bare and
it's sad, do you care J'

539
00:54:16,842 --> 00:54:19,178
(applauding)

540
00:54:32,566 --> 00:54:35,319
- Gee, I wish I could be like her.

541
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:40,657
- No, you don't want to be like her.

542
00:54:40,949 --> 00:54:42,493
- What's wrong with that?

543
00:54:42,785 --> 00:54:44,453
- You wouldn't understand, doll.

544
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:48,874
- I'm a big girl, now Mike, try me.

545
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:52,628
- Okay I'll V)' Y0“-

546
00:54:54,046 --> 00:54:56,632
Honey Morgan, that's who
I'm talking about, the user.

547
00:54:57,758 --> 00:54:59,802
She devours people, men and women alike.

548
00:55:00,093 --> 00:55:01,845
Uses one against the other,

549
00:55:02,137 --> 00:55:04,515
and when she's through
with him she drops them,

550
00:55:04,807 --> 00:55:06,225
just like that.

551
00:55:08,101 --> 00:55:08,852
And man I know.

552
00:55:09,812 --> 00:55:12,147
When I think of what
I'm doing for that dame,

553
00:55:12,439 --> 00:55:13,065
ah forget it.

554
00:55:14,066 --> 00:55:17,694
- Oh I get it, you're sweet on her, huh?

555
00:55:19,988 --> 00:55:21,281
- Yeah, I'm sweet on her.

556
00:55:22,282 --> 00:55:23,033
How'd you guess?

557
00:55:24,993 --> 00:55:29,164
You know something, doll, you're nosy.

558
00:55:39,299 --> 00:55:41,885
(Playful music)

559
00:57:51,306 --> 00:57:54,393
(audience applauding)

560
00:58:04,778 --> 00:58:07,239
- Folks, I have a small
announcement to make.

561
00:58:07,531 --> 00:58:10,033
I guess you all know by now
that my gambling equipment

562
00:58:10,325 --> 00:58:14,830
has been delayed, but the
trucks with the equipment

563
00:58:15,122 --> 00:58:16,164
are on the way.

564
00:58:16,456 --> 00:58:18,375
By tonight there'll be plenty of action.

565
00:58:22,963 --> 00:58:25,882
(suspenseful music)

566
00:58:51,491 --> 00:58:53,535
- The truck's about three miles away.

567
00:58:53,827 --> 00:58:55,120
There's nothing ahead of him.

568
00:59:28,737 --> 00:59:29,529
Go get them, Eric.

569
00:59:43,585 --> 00:59:44,836
Get those cars in place.

570
01:00:13,115 --> 01:00:15,408
Just stay out of sight
and stay out of danger.

571
01:01:41,661 --> 01:01:44,247
Well, you win a few, lose a few.

572
01:03:12,544 --> 01:03:15,964
- We missed you over at
the Beehive, stranger.

573
01:03:16,256 --> 01:03:18,258
And I extended a personal invitation too.

574
01:03:19,467 --> 01:03:20,719
- I didn't mean to be impolite.

575
01:03:21,011 --> 01:03:22,262
I really did mean to come.

576
01:03:22,554 --> 01:03:23,179
- You did?

577
01:03:31,813 --> 01:03:34,149
(soft music)

578
01:03:46,911 --> 01:03:49,080
- It's warm here, isn't it?

579
01:03:49,372 --> 01:03:52,000
- It's even warmer at the Beehive.

580
01:04:19,319 --> 01:04:20,737
- Hey, steady b0)'-

581
01:04:29,412 --> 01:04:30,622
How'd you like that kiss, steady boy?

582
01:04:30,914 --> 01:04:33,792
You get a charge out of
that, or didn't make you mad?

583
01:04:37,170 --> 01:04:39,130
- Mr. Trask, you should be more careful.

584
01:04:39,422 --> 01:04:41,966
- You better be more careful, steady boy.

585
01:04:42,258 --> 01:04:43,510
You're gonna get yourself in big trouble.

586
01:04:43,802 --> 01:04:44,928
Big, big company-

587
01:04:46,638 --> 01:04:47,931
Met your match, steady boy?

588
01:04:49,140 --> 01:04:50,517
Hey, I'm talking to you.

589
01:04:53,395 --> 01:04:55,271
You listen to me.

590
01:04:55,563 --> 01:04:57,899
Don't you walk away from
me when I'm talking to you.

591
01:04:58,191 --> 01:05:00,985
You listen to me.

592
01:05:01,277 --> 01:05:02,695
Listen to me.

593
01:05:02,987 --> 01:05:05,073
You listen to me, you listen to me.

594
01:05:05,365 --> 01:05:06,574
You listen to me.

595
01:05:09,953 --> 01:05:10,995
Sushil animus pig.

596
01:05:11,287 --> 01:05:13,665
I said I was talking to you, now get up.

597
01:05:13,957 --> 01:05:14,666
Get up and fight.

598
01:05:14,958 --> 01:05:16,334
Come on, hit me, hit me.

599
01:05:16,626 --> 01:05:17,669
Hit me, hit me.

600
01:05:19,045 --> 01:05:21,631
- Mr. Trask, I think you've been drinking.

601
01:05:23,466 --> 01:05:26,177
- You think I've been drinking?

602
01:05:26,469 --> 01:05:28,930
He thinks I've been drinking.

603
01:05:29,222 --> 01:05:29,931
You yellow belly.

604
01:05:31,891 --> 01:05:34,185
Don't walk away from me, damn you.

605
01:05:34,477 --> 01:05:36,354
What did I can I do to
make you hit, damn you?

606
01:05:36,646 --> 01:05:38,022
Give me a damn you.

607
01:05:40,191 --> 01:05:45,113
Damn you, damn you, damn you.

608
01:05:55,832 --> 01:05:59,669
- I can't understand why
that man was so angry.

609
01:06:01,212 --> 01:06:03,798
(sensual music)

610
01:06:26,446 --> 01:06:27,989
- That's it, Kenny, I've had it.

611
01:06:28,281 --> 01:06:28,907
I quit.

612
01:06:33,953 --> 01:06:36,331
Okay, how am I doing?

613
01:06:37,540 --> 01:06:39,959
- Barbara, you're not
exactly Billie Jean King.

614
01:06:42,754 --> 01:06:46,299
- Bobby, I like you to meet
my tennis teacher, Kenny.

615
01:06:46,591 --> 01:06:47,634
He's the pro around here.

616
01:06:48,635 --> 01:06:49,385
He's teaching me all the tricks.

617
01:06:50,803 --> 01:06:52,805
- [Bobby] If I taught you all
the tricks, you'd be the pro.

618
01:06:53,765 --> 01:06:57,268
- When I do learn, watch
out, Billie Jean King.

619
01:06:59,646 --> 01:07:03,024
By the way why don't you two try it?

620
01:07:04,317 --> 01:07:05,068
- No thank you.

621
01:07:06,069 --> 01:07:08,238
- I think I'll let you play, Barbara.

622
01:07:08,530 --> 01:07:09,822
- Chicken.

623
01:07:10,114 --> 01:07:10,782
- Hi, Ben.
- Hi.

624
01:07:11,074 --> 01:07:12,158
- How are things going?

625
01:07:12,450 --> 01:07:12,951
- Not so good.

626
01:07:13,243 --> 01:07:16,412
They got all my gambling
equipment, this could be it.

627
01:07:16,704 --> 01:07:18,790
- They seem you know what
you're doing before you do it.

628
01:07:19,082 --> 01:07:20,959
- Yeah, you're so right,
but I've still got a couple

629
01:07:21,251 --> 01:07:22,669
of tricks up my sleeve.

630
01:07:22,961 --> 01:07:24,003
- That's the way to go, Ben.

631
01:07:24,295 --> 01:07:27,799
- Ben, have you seen Lori today?

632
01:07:28,091 --> 01:07:29,801
- Last I saw her, she was
headed for the Beehive.

633
01:07:30,093 --> 01:07:32,345
You know I think our little Lori is doing

634
01:07:32,637 --> 01:07:34,264
a little moonlighting.

635
01:07:36,307 --> 01:07:38,184
Well I got things to do,
kids, I'll see you later.

636
01:07:42,105 --> 01:07:43,523
- Well that little dingbat.

637
01:07:43,815 --> 01:07:46,109
- Oh God, we can't leave
her alone anywhere.

638
01:07:46,401 --> 01:07:49,279
- Come on, let's go over
to Beehive and get her.

639
01:07:49,571 --> 01:07:51,614
- I've got into drive into town anyway,

640
01:07:51,906 --> 01:07:52,782
can I give you a lift?

641
01:08:13,469 --> 01:08:14,220
- Thanks a lot for the ride, Bob.

642
01:08:14,512 --> 01:08:15,054
I appreciate it.

643
01:08:15,346 --> 01:08:16,556
I'll see you later.

644
01:08:16,848 --> 01:08:17,724
- Thanks Bob.

645
01:08:45,752 --> 01:08:47,170
- All right girls, settle down.

646
01:08:47,462 --> 01:08:48,713
Do pass these out sweetheart.

647
01:08:53,176 --> 01:08:55,637
Well, I always like to have a little talk

648
01:08:55,928 --> 01:08:57,472
with my new girls.

649
01:08:57,764 --> 01:09:00,350
It leads to a better understanding.

650
01:09:00,642 --> 01:09:05,021
Now we're all here for one thing, money.

651
01:09:06,105 --> 01:09:07,231
And may be a little fun.

652
01:09:08,733 --> 01:09:10,735
Now that paper that you have

653
01:09:11,027 --> 01:09:13,696
lists all the do's and don'ts around here.

654
01:09:13,988 --> 01:09:17,450
I run a tight ship so I
want you to learn them.

655
01:09:17,742 --> 01:09:19,160
Memorize them.

656
01:09:19,452 --> 01:09:20,620
- I'll wash out for sure.

657
01:09:24,957 --> 01:09:27,460
- One more thing, very, very important.

658
01:09:27,752 --> 01:09:29,295
You're not in business for yourself,

659
01:09:29,587 --> 01:09:31,839
so there's not to be any wallet boosting

660
01:09:32,131 --> 01:09:36,636
and there's not to be any
con about your sick kids,

661
01:09:36,928 --> 01:09:39,055
and you're not to pry
into the personal lives

662
01:09:39,347 --> 01:09:41,265
of the customers.

663
01:09:41,557 --> 01:09:44,936
This is the class operation
and I'm paying you top dollar.

664
01:09:45,228 --> 01:09:48,022
And I want you to make
sure that the customer

665
01:09:48,314 --> 01:09:49,941
wants to come back.

666
01:09:51,484 --> 01:09:56,364
Now our motto is you tease
them, you please them

667
01:09:57,365 --> 01:09:59,575
and I fleece them.

668
01:10:02,954 --> 01:10:03,705
Melody.

669
01:10:05,832 --> 01:10:10,753
Girls, I want to introduce
you to a Beehive exclusive.

670
01:10:13,631 --> 01:10:15,883
Girls, meet Mabel.

671
01:10:17,009 --> 01:10:19,095
- Hello, Mabel.
- Hi Mabel.

672
01:10:20,388 --> 01:10:22,390
- Babel handles the drunks.

673
01:10:22,682 --> 01:10:24,684
You get a drunk that's too far gone,

674
01:10:24,976 --> 01:10:27,437
just hand him Mabel in the dark.

675
01:10:27,729 --> 01:10:30,732
There's a Mabel, nude of
course, in every closet,

676
01:10:31,023 --> 01:10:32,275
in every room.

677
01:10:32,567 --> 01:10:34,193
One old minor liked Mabel so much,

678
01:10:34,485 --> 01:10:36,446
he bought her and lived
happily ever after.

679
01:10:40,032 --> 01:10:42,243
Does this doll really work?

680
01:10:43,244 --> 01:10:44,120
- Of course.

681
01:10:44,412 --> 01:10:46,706
If they're drunk they
can't tell the difference.

682
01:10:46,998 --> 01:10:50,501
- Does she have, you know, everything?

683
01:10:51,502 --> 01:10:54,547
- Well, sweetie not everything you have.

684
01:10:54,839 --> 01:10:57,425
- No, but she makes a lot more sense.

685
01:10:59,218 --> 01:11:01,596
- All right, girls dress rehearsal.

686
01:11:02,889 --> 01:11:04,432
I have a customer waiting.

687
01:11:05,558 --> 01:11:08,936
Now let me see.

688
01:11:24,410 --> 01:11:27,121
- Take it easy, will you please lie down?

689
01:11:28,873 --> 01:11:30,541
- Oh you should mouth shall pretty.

690
01:11:34,629 --> 01:11:36,839
Can you turn a damn light on in here?

691
01:11:37,131 --> 01:11:39,091
I get scared in the dark.

692
01:11:39,383 --> 01:11:40,176
- Listen don't be afraid, I'm here.

693
01:11:40,468 --> 01:11:41,427
I'm here, okay?

694
01:11:53,481 --> 01:11:54,232
- Are you awake?

695
01:11:57,819 --> 01:12:00,279
- Oh, did We do it?

696
01:12:01,489 --> 01:12:02,865
Was I good?

697
01:12:03,157 --> 01:12:03,825
- You were great.

698
01:12:04,867 --> 01:12:06,536
- Oh goody, let's do it again.

699
01:12:12,041 --> 01:12:13,251
- Come here.

700
01:12:13,543 --> 01:12:14,293
- It's do it again.

701
01:12:17,672 --> 01:12:18,422
- Excuse me.

702
01:12:21,008 --> 01:12:21,676
- Don't go away.

703
01:12:21,968 --> 01:12:22,593
- I'll come back.

704
01:12:24,887 --> 01:12:28,182
Listen you just practice
and take care of yourself.

705
01:12:28,474 --> 01:12:30,017
You need the practice.

706
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:33,604
What am I gonna do now?

707
01:12:34,897 --> 01:12:35,857
- I don't know.

708
01:12:37,567 --> 01:12:38,776
Maybe he'll pass out soon.

709
01:12:39,068 --> 01:12:39,694
- No.

710
01:12:42,071 --> 01:12:43,531
- Hold it, I got an idea.

711
01:12:49,996 --> 01:12:51,163
- Give him Mabel.

712
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:53,165
- That's a terrific idea.

713
01:13:03,426 --> 01:13:05,553
I'm back.

714
01:13:05,845 --> 01:13:09,849
- Oh yeah, oh yeah.

715
01:13:15,354 --> 01:13:18,274
You feel better than you did before.

716
01:13:34,248 --> 01:13:37,668
- Oh, it sounds like they're
having lots of fun in there.

717
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:39,795
- You little dingbat,
you're the reason why

718
01:13:40,087 --> 01:13:41,839
we're here in the first place.

719
01:13:42,131 --> 01:13:44,091
Come on, I'm gonna get you
back to that Lucky Dollar--

720
01:13:44,383 --> 01:13:45,551
- No, I don't wanna go.

721
01:13:45,843 --> 01:13:49,096
- Oh yes you are, we're going back.

722
01:13:49,388 --> 01:13:51,599
(folk music)

723
01:14:02,818 --> 01:14:07,740
- You don't talk much, do you?

724
01:14:18,876 --> 01:14:20,419
What's the matter, honey?

725
01:14:20,711 --> 01:14:21,837
You need some rolades?

726
01:14:23,547 --> 01:14:25,925
Honey, it's all right.

727
01:14:26,217 --> 01:14:26,968
I'm not mad at you.

728
01:14:28,010 --> 01:14:28,761
Honey...

729
01:14:39,230 --> 01:14:40,398
Anybody got a pump?

730
01:15:35,161 --> 01:15:37,204
- Well Mike, what did you
want to talk to me about?

731
01:15:37,496 --> 01:15:38,622
- Brewster's making another shipment.

732
01:15:38,914 --> 01:15:40,207
The boys are ready to take it.

733
01:15:41,542 --> 01:15:42,293
- Good.

734
01:15:43,669 --> 01:15:44,420
Anything else?

735
01:15:45,421 --> 01:15:47,715
- Mm-hmm, I got a funny feeling.

736
01:15:48,007 --> 01:15:50,301
Brewster's up to something,
I want to call it off.

737
01:15:50,593 --> 01:15:51,844
- You want?

738
01:15:54,180 --> 01:15:56,807
You work for me, it's what I want.

739
01:15:57,099 --> 01:15:58,392
- I thought we were in this together.

740
01:15:58,684 --> 01:16:01,979
- You thought, look this is just a job.

741
01:16:02,271 --> 01:16:05,566
Take it or leave it, don't
try to make it personal.

742
01:16:05,858 --> 01:16:06,484
- Personal?

743
01:16:08,069 --> 01:16:09,820
It was personal once.

744
01:16:10,112 --> 01:16:11,405
We were good for each other, Honey.

745
01:16:11,697 --> 01:16:12,406
We could be again.

746
01:16:13,491 --> 01:16:18,329
- Mike, you just don't want to understand.

747
01:16:18,621 --> 01:16:21,248
It's over, we are over.

748
01:16:21,540 --> 01:16:22,374
- Honey, please.

749
01:16:22,666 --> 01:16:25,503
- Mike, just play your cards right.

750
01:16:25,795 --> 01:16:27,379
When the word gets around that there's oil

751
01:16:27,671 --> 01:16:29,423
under all this land that
we've been grabbing--

752
01:16:29,715 --> 01:16:32,593
- Okay, okay, I get the message.

753
01:16:42,812 --> 01:16:43,479
- You ready to go in?

754
01:16:43,771 --> 01:16:44,313
- Yeah.

755
01:16:44,605 --> 01:16:45,189
- Me too.

756
01:16:45,481 --> 01:16:46,982
Lori? - Yeah?

757
01:16:47,274 --> 01:16:48,567
- Lori, come here.

758
01:16:51,195 --> 01:16:52,113
okay

759
01:16:52,404 --> 01:16:53,114
What do you want?

760
01:16:53,405 --> 01:16:54,115
- Hey, let's go to our rooms now.

761
01:16:54,406 --> 01:16:54,949
- But I like it here.

762
01:16:55,241 --> 01:16:56,200
- No, you don't.

763
01:16:56,492 --> 01:16:57,034
- I don't?

764
01:16:57,326 --> 01:16:58,577
- No, besides we can't leave you here.

765
01:16:58,869 --> 01:17:00,412
You can't even swim.

766
01:17:00,704 --> 01:17:04,375
- We've got lifeguards right over there.

767
01:17:04,667 --> 01:17:06,919
- Yeah, what trouble can she get into?

768
01:17:07,211 --> 01:17:08,712
_ okay-

769
01:17:10,047 --> 01:17:10,714
- See you later.

770
01:17:11,006 --> 01:17:12,049
- See you guys later.

771
01:17:12,341 --> 01:17:13,759
- But you stay right there.

772
01:17:14,051 --> 01:17:15,010
- Yes, mother.

773
01:17:20,850 --> 01:17:23,435
(Playful music)

774
01:17:37,116 --> 01:17:39,368
- We're right in the middle.

775
01:17:47,418 --> 01:17:49,920
(upbeat music)

776
01:18:07,021 --> 01:18:07,771
- Help-

777
01:18:11,525 --> 01:18:13,027
Help, I'm drowning.

778
01:18:14,612 --> 01:18:15,446
- Somebody's drowning.

779
01:18:15,738 --> 01:18:18,240
- Nevermind her, just throw a card.

780
01:18:18,532 --> 01:18:19,742
- But somebody is drowning.

781
01:18:25,748 --> 01:18:27,416
- Help, I'm drowning.

782
01:18:29,293 --> 01:18:30,044
Help.

783
01:18:32,046 --> 01:18:33,422
- Will you throw a card?

784
01:18:34,548 --> 01:18:36,300
That's it, gin.

785
01:18:36,592 --> 01:18:37,801
Now let's go get her.

786
01:18:40,763 --> 01:18:42,848
- Help, help I'm drowning.

787
01:18:44,475 --> 01:18:48,145
- We'll be right there,
we'll be right there.

788
01:18:50,898 --> 01:18:52,066
Stop screaming.

789
01:18:57,321 --> 01:18:58,447
- It's cold.

790
01:18:58,739 --> 01:19:00,115
- Let's go get her.

791
01:19:07,248 --> 01:19:09,083
Not there, by her legs.

792
01:19:14,922 --> 01:19:17,174
It'll be all right,
everything will be all right.

793
01:19:17,466 --> 01:19:19,677
Everything will be all right.

794
01:19:21,553 --> 01:19:23,097
This kid is not a feather.

795
01:19:27,977 --> 01:19:29,395
- Resuscitate her.

796
01:19:31,063 --> 01:19:31,730
- What?

797
01:19:32,022 --> 01:19:32,648
- Resuscitate her.

798
01:19:34,608 --> 01:19:36,235
- In front of everybody?

799
01:19:36,527 --> 01:19:38,279
- Blow in her mouth, blow in her mouth.

800
01:19:41,573 --> 01:19:43,575
No, closer.

801
01:19:43,867 --> 01:19:44,493
- Closer?

802
01:20:00,592 --> 01:20:01,343
- My prince charming.

803
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:14,690
- What the hell's happening?

804
01:20:14,982 --> 01:20:15,733
What do they want?

805
01:20:16,025 --> 01:20:16,775
- Beats me, man.

806
01:20:17,067 --> 01:20:18,527
You know, I'm beginning to
believe there's some truth

807
01:20:18,819 --> 01:20:19,403
to those old legends.

808
01:20:19,695 --> 01:20:20,779
- Oh, legends hell.

809
01:20:21,071 --> 01:20:22,823
Legends don't steal gambling equipment.

810
01:20:23,115 --> 01:20:23,657
I'm gonna get--

811
01:20:23,949 --> 01:20:24,992
- Sure Ben, sure.

812
01:20:25,284 --> 01:20:26,910
If there's anything I can
do to help you, let me know.

813
01:20:27,202 --> 01:20:29,705
- You haven't been a much help
lately, I'll tell you that.

814
01:20:29,997 --> 01:20:31,915
- You once told me that you
wanted to run the operation.

815
01:20:32,207 --> 01:20:33,417
Okay, you run it.

816
01:20:33,709 --> 01:20:35,127
I'm just your Foreman, remember?

817
01:20:35,419 --> 01:20:36,128
I ain't a cop.

818
01:20:50,351 --> 01:20:52,686
(soft music)

819
01:21:23,801 --> 01:21:25,803
- You know, I'm hungry.

820
01:21:26,095 --> 01:21:27,596
- Well, it's lunchtime, let's eat.

821
01:21:51,954 --> 01:21:53,288
- Where's the salami?

822
01:21:53,580 --> 01:21:54,331
Salami's down here.

823
01:22:07,219 --> 01:22:08,762
- Where's the pastrami?

824
01:22:09,054 --> 01:22:10,764
- Pastrami's down here.

825
01:22:11,890 --> 01:22:12,850
- We can put in one place.

826
01:22:22,568 --> 01:22:23,235
- Where's the Swiss cheese?

827
01:22:23,527 --> 01:22:24,695
- Swiss cheese is over here.

828
01:22:36,582 --> 01:22:37,541
No, pickles.

829
01:22:37,833 --> 01:22:39,501
- Yeah there's some
horseradish down there.

830
01:22:39,793 --> 01:22:41,753
- Tomatoes, oh to get some soda too.

831
01:22:43,046 --> 01:22:44,381
- Oh you want a soda?

832
01:22:47,050 --> 01:22:47,718
- What's the difference, eat.

833
01:22:48,010 --> 01:22:49,094
It's all on there.

834
01:22:49,386 --> 01:22:50,846
- Where's the sardines?

835
01:22:51,138 --> 01:22:52,931
Got some sardines there?

836
01:22:54,057 --> 01:22:55,309
- Sardines here?

837
01:22:55,601 --> 01:22:57,436
- Somewhere there.

838
01:22:57,728 --> 01:22:59,938
(soft music)

839
01:23:29,259 --> 01:23:30,093
- Any salami left?

840
01:23:31,053 --> 01:23:32,596
- One more piece, right here.

841
01:23:32,888 --> 01:23:33,514
- Oh good.

842
01:23:37,809 --> 01:23:39,019
- Oh enough here, buddy.

843
01:23:39,311 --> 01:23:40,771
This is all we have.

844
01:23:41,897 --> 01:23:42,814
Any cheese there?

845
01:23:43,106 --> 01:23:44,233
- Cheese, cheese right there.

846
01:23:44,525 --> 01:23:45,484
- Right there?

847
01:23:48,070 --> 01:23:48,820
That's good?

848
01:23:51,823 --> 01:23:54,076
- Where's the corned beef, any left?

849
01:23:54,368 --> 01:23:55,118
- No more corned beef.

850
01:23:55,410 --> 01:23:57,037
- No more corned beef?

851
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:02,376
(soft music)

852
01:24:29,778 --> 01:24:30,696
- I'm sorry.

853
01:24:42,583 --> 01:24:45,627
- Excuse me, have you
gentlemen seen Mr. Brewster?

854
01:24:45,919 --> 01:24:49,256
- Brewster went after
hoods with the hoods.

855
01:24:51,091 --> 01:24:52,718
- Thank you.

856
01:24:53,010 --> 01:24:54,720
- You're welcome.

857
01:24:55,012 --> 01:24:55,721
- Who's that?

858
01:24:56,013 --> 01:24:56,847
- That's Bobby.

859
01:24:57,139 --> 01:24:58,015
' Who?

860
01:24:58,307 --> 01:25:00,434
- You know, Bobby Lipschits.

861
01:25:16,617 --> 01:25:19,453
(orchestral music)

862
01:25:49,524 --> 01:25:51,777
Bobby, is that you?
- Bobby, is that you?

863
01:25:54,321 --> 01:25:55,238
- Name is Bob.

864
01:25:56,198 --> 01:25:57,407
Which way they 9O?

865
01:25:57,699 --> 01:26:00,994
- They went that way.
- They went that way.

866
01:26:01,286 --> 01:26:03,372
(whistling)

867
01:26:12,089 --> 01:26:14,007
- He's witty, isn't he?

868
01:26:15,801 --> 01:26:18,387
(intense music)

869
01:28:24,221 --> 01:28:26,389
- After him, get after him.

870
01:29:24,573 --> 01:29:25,907
- Hey look out, here comes
the truck, the truck.

871
01:29:26,199 --> 01:29:28,910
Back up, watch the truck, watch it.

872
01:32:18,455 --> 01:32:20,915
- Hold it, okay, you proved
your point you're a stet.

873
01:32:21,207 --> 01:32:22,459
Now you're not gonna whip me,

874
01:32:22,751 --> 01:32:23,460
and I'm not I'm gonna whip you,

875
01:32:23,752 --> 01:32:24,294
so what do you say we call it a draw?

876
01:32:24,586 --> 01:32:25,128
Okay?

877
01:32:25,420 --> 01:32:26,713
No, better still, you win.

878
01:32:27,005 --> 01:32:28,339
All right?

879
01:32:28,631 --> 01:32:29,591
- I like that.

880
01:32:53,782 --> 01:32:55,658
- Honey child, I want to talk to you.

881
01:32:55,950 --> 01:32:56,743
- Ah, sit down, Ben.

882
01:32:59,204 --> 01:33:00,038
- And you know I've always wanted to buy

883
01:33:00,330 --> 01:33:02,123
into your operation, right?

884
01:33:02,415 --> 01:33:04,793
- Right, but I'm still not selling.

885
01:33:06,002 --> 01:33:07,337
- I kind of think you will.

886
01:33:09,506 --> 01:33:11,883
Now that is Mike Trask's
signed confession.

887
01:33:16,846 --> 01:33:20,100
Now if we become partners,
that goes into my safe.

888
01:33:20,391 --> 01:33:21,101
Ifnotu

889
01:33:26,356 --> 01:33:28,024
- Looks like you got a partner.

890
01:33:28,316 --> 01:33:29,150
- I'll take that.

891
01:33:30,902 --> 01:33:31,945
Shake partner.

892
01:34:15,029 --> 01:34:16,406
- Sure I can't persuade you to stay?

893
01:34:16,698 --> 01:34:18,408
- Thank you, ma'am.

894
01:34:18,700 --> 01:34:19,784
My work here is done.

895
01:34:20,785 --> 01:34:21,953
- Oh, I don't know.

896
01:34:22,245 --> 01:34:24,873
I think maybe we have a
little unfinished business.

897
01:34:25,165 --> 01:34:26,624
- Come on, Honey, come on.

898
01:34:28,251 --> 01:34:29,002
- Bye.

899
01:34:31,379 --> 01:34:33,965
- Are you sure he's the same
man we saw in the plane?

900
01:34:37,093 --> 01:34:39,429
(soft music)

901
01:34:50,773 --> 01:34:52,817
- Who is he, really?

902
01:34:53,860 --> 01:34:57,947
- He never says Honey, he never says.

903
01:35:07,916 --> 01:35:08,791
- Where in the heck is Lori?

904
01:35:09,083 --> 01:35:09,918
Look.

905
01:35:10,210 --> 01:35:12,253
- Damn it, she knows we
got a plane to catch.

906
01:35:12,545 --> 01:35:14,172
- Knowing Lori, she's got a live one.

907
01:35:15,381 --> 01:35:16,674
- Sure has.

908
01:35:19,844 --> 01:35:21,679
- Hi girls.

909
01:35:25,934 --> 01:35:26,893
Come here, come here.

910
01:35:31,356 --> 01:35:33,399
Hi, Debbie, Barbara.

911
01:35:33,691 --> 01:35:35,818
I want you to meet my new daddy.

912
01:35:39,197 --> 01:35:41,783
(intense music)

913
01:35:50,208 --> 01:35:52,543
Oh come on, come on, come on.

914
01:35:54,254 --> 01:35:55,004
- Bye.

915
01:35:56,297 --> 01:35:57,048
- Bye.

916
01:35:58,341 --> 01:35:59,259
- Bye.
- Bye.

917
01:36:05,890 --> 01:36:07,141
- Well, blew anotherjob.

918
01:36:07,433 --> 01:36:08,142
- Well sure don't blame me,

919
01:36:08,434 --> 01:36:09,269
it's your fault, not mine.

920
01:36:09,560 --> 01:36:10,103
' My fault?

921
01:36:10,395 --> 01:36:11,104
It's your fault.

922
01:36:11,396 --> 01:36:12,689
What do you want from me?

923
01:36:12,981 --> 01:36:13,523
- What do I want from you?

924
01:36:13,815 --> 01:36:14,357
You always blow the job.

925
01:36:14,649 --> 01:36:15,441
- Oh, shut up, will you?

926
01:36:15,733 --> 01:36:16,276
- What do you mean, shut up?

927
01:36:16,567 --> 01:36:17,819
We'd of had a job yet if it wasn't--

928
01:36:18,111 --> 01:36:21,030
- I didn't know, I didn't
know it was his wife.

929
01:36:21,322 --> 01:36:22,657
- Well who'd you think
it was, his daughter?

930
01:36:22,949 --> 01:36:24,409
- Stop ad libbing, will you?

931
01:36:24,701 --> 01:36:26,286
Oh gosh, I'll tell you
something, I don't know--

932
01:36:26,577 --> 01:36:27,745
- You listen to me.

933
01:36:28,037 --> 01:36:29,205
We'd of been there yet if hadn't been--

934
01:36:29,497 --> 01:36:30,039
- Don't holler.

935
01:36:30,331 --> 01:36:30,873
- I'm not hollering.

936
01:36:31,165 --> 01:36:32,000
I'm telling you we'd of been there yet.

937
01:36:32,292 --> 01:36:33,001
- Don't holler.

938
01:36:33,293 --> 01:36:35,086
- You know we'd of--
- Don't holler.

939
01:36:35,378 --> 01:36:36,963
Please, don't holler.

940
01:36:37,255 --> 01:36:39,632

941
01:36:39,924 --> 01:36:42,552

01:36:48,641 --> 01:36:49,892
Fine, I got a snack for you.

945
01:36:50,184 --> 01:36:51,644
