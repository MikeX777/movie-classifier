1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:04,240
(bright music)

2
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,160
- P.
- What?

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,040
- [Man] It's not resents, P,
presents.

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,200
- [Man] Oh, got it.

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,880
(exciting orchestral music)

6
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,560
(airplane engine roaring)

7
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,840
(chandelier rattling)

8
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,680
(classical music)

9
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,000
(woman yawning)

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,840
(people shouting)

11
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,120
- Sir, please wake up.

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,880
Wake up, sir.

13
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,960
Wake up you little son of bitch,
you shit.

14
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,360
(slapping)
(crowd gasping)

15
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,600
I'm sorry sir, but
you're in a dirty dream.

16
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,320
- I always have sexually
oriented dreams.

17
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,640
My upbringing I think.

18
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,720
I grew up in a family
of die hard chauvinists.

19
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,240
- I'm sorry, sir, but I'm a
feminist

20
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,240
and I can't allow you to
undress me in your dreams.

21
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,520
- Hey, please, I need some
water.

22
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,080
- Oh yes, you old bitch,
I'll be there in a moment.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,120
- The same dream again?

24
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,080
- Haunting me like the
Phantom of the Opera.

25
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,280
- "The Hound of the
Baskervilles."

26
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,640
- Calvin Klein's Obsession.

27
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,680
- It's a healthy dream.

28
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,280
Welcome to Hollywood, Frank.

29
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,120
- Why thank you, Frank.

30
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,320
- You're welcome, Frank.

31
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,600
- Do you realize we just
completed seven sentences

32
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,960
full of intellectual subtext?

33
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:04,840
I'm exhausted.

34
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,160
- Crash out, dude.

35
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,840
- Extremely well put, Mr.
Ros-top-o-vitz.

36
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,720
(upbeat music)

37
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,040
- May I help you, miss?

38
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,480
- Pardon doll, where is the
bathroom?

39
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,720
- Bathroom, first door on the
left.

40
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,720
- Thank you.

41
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,240
(door banging)
(woman screaming)

42
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,440
(strong wind blowing)

43
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,840
- Or was that the right.

44
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,800
No, left is right.

45
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,760
(speaker voice muffled)

46
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,520
- Criticized federal
police for infringement

47
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,880
on his civil rights,

48
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,720
and called upon fellow South
Americans to condemn further-

49
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,000
- Easy on the Sweet and Low,
Farrah.

50
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,520
There's not enough jam
on the toast, Sofia.

51
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,360
Sheila, the coffee was too
black.

52
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,440
And not too much pulp
in the juice, Loretta.

53
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,680
What was that bit again?

54
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,400
- I will protect my right to
speak freely with my life.

55
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,520
- They should have castrated him
first

56
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,840
and then executed him, go on.

57
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,800
(phone ringing)

58
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,800
That'll be Alex from the studio.

59
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,920
How much we gross last night?

60
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,200
Good, that's good.

61
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,520
Fire six vice presidents,
call me in the morning.

62
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,080
- Wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee.

63
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:27,280
(ominous music)
(people chattering)

64
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,200
- [Garcia] Yes, I'm
scared, you guessed right.

65
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,520
No, I'm not afraid of flying.

66
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,640
Yes, I'm scared for my life.

67
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,360
I'm coming to L.A. to testify

68
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,280
against the ketchup tycoon
slash drug lord Rupert Hess.

69
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,800
Yes, this is where I'm keeping
the evidence against him.

70
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,480
Now I'm not stupid enough
to arrive in Los Angeles

71
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,600
carrying this with me.

72
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,720
Yes, police promise me
protection.

73
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,440
Now I don't believe them.

74
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,280
Hess I'll take care of myself.

75
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,040
I don't know this guy.

76
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,760
Sure, I have ways of finding
out.

77
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,240
(camera snapping)
(tense music)

78
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,120
- That slimy poisonous snake.

79
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,480
- That sleazy, lowlife
informant.

80
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,480
He must be bringing evidence
against me.

81
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,800
Have him killed, Bruno.

82
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,960
- Please?
- What?

83
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,320
- Have him killed, please.

84
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,960
- I want him dead.
- Okay.

85
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,280
- Look at them, beautiful,
unsuspected, innocent.

86
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,640
The key to my greatest scheme
ever.

87
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,400
There's a hundred million big
ones riding on those beauties.

88
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,960
(billiard balls banging)

89
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,080
Kill Garcia first and
then pick up the girls.

90
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,120
No, pick up the girls
first and then kill Garcia.

91
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,240
- But if I pick up the girls
first and then kill Garcia

92
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,560
the girls will see me killing
Garcia.

93
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,200
- Darn, kill Garcia first
and then pick up the girls.

94
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,440
(ball smashing)

95
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,760
- Great idea, boss.

96
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,200
(Frank yawning)

97
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,240
(birds chirping)

98
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,080
- Morning, Frank.
- Morning, Frank.

99
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,440
Sleep like a baby?

100
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,600
- Yeah, yeah, and I'm not the
only one.

101
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,120
Look at the big guy, he's out
cold.

102
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,960
(upbeat music)

103
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,160

(alarm sounding)

113

- My God, it's amazing.

114
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
- What's amazing?

115
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,800
- You look just like
Arnold Schwarzenegger.

116
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,800
- Who's he work for?

117
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,320
- You must be from another
planet.

118
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,400
- I'm from Brooklyn.
- That qualifies.

119

120
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,160

now disembarking at gate 69.

123

with their hideous plans of
extermination.

136
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,440
we're waiting for an informer?

137
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,560

mislead us into thinking

138
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,520
those gentlemen behind you are
assassins.

- Oh, I am Garcia, meet
me in the men's room.

143
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,800
- Strange fella.

144
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,640
Think he's gay?

- Mine's already here, Frank.

150
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,160
- That's not your suitcase,
Frank, your suitcase isn't pink.

151
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,000
- Yes, it is.

152
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,120
- You're making a dreadful
mistake.

153
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,280
- Which can only help the plot.

154
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,200
- My turn.

155
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,360
What next?

156
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,200

no other type of unloading.

164

- Actually, I'm a very sensitive
man.

165
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,240
As a small boy, I had a terrible
childhood

166
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,880
which haunts me and
sometimes makes me violent.

167
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,920
Other than that I'm just an
average guy.

168
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:26,880
Please talk.

169
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,200

(punching)

171
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,560
That wasn't funny, Frank.

172
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,720
- That wasn't me, Frank.
- My mistake, Frank.

173
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,880
- So you gonna talk?

174
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,080
- Here we go again.

175
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,560
My dear fellow, are you
constipated by any chance?

176
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,440
(grunting)

177
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,680
- Oh, definitely constipated,
poor fellow.

178
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,760
Don't worry, like they
say, easy come, easy go.

179
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,920
- Very apropos, Frank.
- Ooh, thank you, Frank.

180
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,000
- I'll talk.
- I'm all ears.

181
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,480
- I'm here to testify against
Rupert Hess.

182
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,520
- Duh, what's your evidence?

183
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:07,200
- A very thick organizer with
names, phone numbers, dates.

184
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,280
- Would you give it to
me before I kill you?

185
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:12,960
- I don't have it, I got
rid of it on the plane.

186
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,040
Some other passenger
has it in his carry on.

187
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,760
- The name of that passenger?

188
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,800
- Ros-top-o-vitz.

189
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,680
- I didn't hear that, Garcia.

190
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,800
- Mr. Ros-top-o-vitz!

191
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,320
- Yes, Mr. Guggenheimer?
- That wasn't me, Frank.

192
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,400
- Who is this Ros-top-o-vitz?

193
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,880
- About five-ten, brown hair,
green eyes, a Capricorn,

194
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,960
real sensitive but a great sense
of humor.

195
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,080
- Where can I find him?

196
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,400
- He's a citizen of the world,

197
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,200
presently on a business trip to
L.A.

198
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,560
He frequents bars, strip
clubs and four-star hotels

199
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,240
where single women can be
approached.

200
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,000
- Does he know about the
notebook?

201
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,920
- What notebook?

202
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,240
- The notebook Garcia put in his
carry on

203
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,960
unsuspected while Ros-top-o-vitz
was asleep on the plane?

204
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,600
- Nah, the man's completely
oblivious.

205
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,080
- We'll have to block all the
exits.

206
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,880
If he doesn't cooperate,
we'll have to kill him.

207
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,160
Thanks Garcia, you made
my life a lot easier.

208
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,600
- So you're not going to kill
me?

209
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,840
- Ah, I almost forgot.

210
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,360
(gun shooting)
(tense music)

211
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,760
Why do I always forget these
things?

212
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,400
I don't smoke, I don't drink,

213
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,000
I still can't remember nothing.

214
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,720
What was that name he said
again?

215
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,760
- Ros-top-o-vitz.

216
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,080
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

217
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,000
You think constipation killed
him?

218
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,200
- No, it was definitely
a 48 with a silencer.

219
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,720
He realized they know I
have the crucial agenda.

220
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,960
- You do?

221
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,920
(echoing)

222
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,000
- Frank.

223
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,880
- You think they're going to
kill you?

224
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,880
- Positively.

225
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,080
- Well, then you better get out
there.

226
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,440
If they take you out first,
I can get away unharmed.

227
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,640
- Thanks, Frank.

228
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,520
- What are friends for, Frank?

229
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,440
- The villains are looking for a
man.

230
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,040
Five-10, brown hair, green eyes.

231
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,280
- A Capricorn, real sensitive.

232
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,080
- Which means these incorrect
suitcases

233
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,280
will now come in handy.

234
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,120
- Don't wear red, goes
better with my eyes.

235
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,200
Frank, trust me on this.

236
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,840
It's a foolproof plan.

237
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:20,000
All we have to do is slip out
of here completely unnoticed.

238
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,560
(orchestral pageant music)

239
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,320
(romantic music)

240
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,000
(dancers clapping)

241
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,560
- You must be with the pageant.

242
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,600
- You must be Bruno.
- At your service.

243
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,680
May I take your luggage?

244
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,000
- But of course.

245
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,120
- Help police!

246
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,600
- They're stealing our luggage!

247
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,080
- Help police!

248
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,840
(women shouting)

249
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,680
- Ladies, allow me.

250
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,920
(punching)

251
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,880
Geez, dykes.

252
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:19,920
(breath freshener spraying)

253
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,720
- Hi, I'm Ethel.
- And I'm Mirabelle.

254
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,760
- We do makeup.
- And hair.

255
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,360
- We also do body makeup.

256
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,560
Any, if you need some work on
your tans?

257
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,040
- I do.

258
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,920
Maybe I'll need you in
the first couple of days.

259
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,400
I don't want to come out
pale in the pictures.

260
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,600
I'm going to win this pageant.

261
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,000
- I'm sure you will.

262
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,680
- Excuse me, is there a ladies
room?

263
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,000
- Yeah.

264
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,240
In the back.

265
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,520
- You're here.

266
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,320
You go past the jacuzzi,

267
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,680
after the master suite
make a right, then a left.

268
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,440
Go back about a quarter mile,

269
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,200
you'll be there in about 10
minutes.

270
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,680
- You're so sweet.

271
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,720
Mirabelle, sweetie, didn't you
say

272
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,880
you had to powder your nose?

273
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,840
- What, no, my nose is fine.

274
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,840
- She just gets carried away
sometimes.

275
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,560
(upbeat music)

276
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,120
- Big bus.
- No shit.

277
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,600
We need to talk.

278
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,920
- My feet are killing me
and my bra is too tight.

279
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,120
- Personally, I hate pantyhose

280
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,480
and red lipstick doesn't suit me
at all.

281
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,320
- Frank!

282
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,200
- Don't wrinkle my dress, bitch.

283
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,200
- Frank, come to your senses.

284
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,520
You don't give a shit about the
dress.

285
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,600
You're not a woman.

286
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,280
- I'm not a woman?

287
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,200
I'm not a woman.

288
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,360
Well, thank God, it's still
there.

289
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,440
I'm not a woman.

290
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,760
Is that good or bad?

291
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,680
- We gotta get out of here.

292
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,280
This whole thing is getting out
of hand.

293
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,680
Bruno is-
- Who's Bruno?

294
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,920
- You know, the Arnold
Schwarzenegger type.

295
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,880
- How did you know his name?

296
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,960
- I don't know.

297
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,240
- Are you having an affair with
him?

298
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,720
- You crazy son of a bitch!

299
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,440
Listen to me, look at me, what
do you see?

300
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,960
- Your mascara is running.

301
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,920
- Who am I?

302
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,720
- An ugly Jap who's jealous of
my body.

303
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,840
- Frank!

304
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,680
(slapping)

305
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,520
Snap out of it.

306
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:45,040
- You hurt me, but I liked it.

307
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,400
Just kidding, I'm okay.

308
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,240
- Who are you?

309
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,800
- I'm Frank Guggenheimer.
- Thank God.

310
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,400
Now listen, Frank, we came here
to-

311
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,600
- Make it in Hollywood, act,
write and direct, I know that.

312
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,440
- Now look at us.

313
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,920
We're up to our ass in
drugs, prostitution,

314
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,240
maybe even assassination.

315
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,360
- Hey, look on the bright side.

316
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,800
You ever have so much fun being
a broad?

317
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,960
- Think how much fun you're
gonna have

318
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,200
when Bruno finds out you're not

319
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,080
and shoots you right between the
eyes.

320
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,560
You know what this is?

321
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,720
- Garcia's little brown book?

322
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,000
- That's right and it's hot,

323
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,720
names, numbers, dates of
all Hess's drug activities.

324
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,200
(door knocking)

325
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,760
- Who, who is it?

326
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,120
- [Marsha] It's me, Marsha, can
I come in?

327
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,080
- Yes.
- Yes.

328
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,320
- Well, which is it?

329
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,920
(romantic music)

330
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,680
Oh, I hope you don't mind.

331
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,680
It's getting so hot back there

332
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:35,080
and I need to change into-
- Something more comfortable?

333
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,000
- You got it.

334
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,880
It's so hot here in
L.A. this time of year.

335
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,680
- Hell.
- Yes, hell

336
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,640
- Much better.

337
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,000
- Much.
- Yes, much.

338
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,640
- Thanks girls, bye.

339
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,440
- What was that you were saying

340
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,720
about getting out of here,
Frank?

341
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,640
- I don't remember anymore.

342
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,080
- On one hand, we have real
danger,

343
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,800
the possibility of grievous
bodily harm,

344
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,520
even premature mortality.

345
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,000
- On the other we have ironclad
evidence

346
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,360
against the wanted drug lord

347
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,440
and also 10 gorgeous women.

348
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,280
What do you say?

349
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,520
- We're young, we're
tough, we can't quit now.

350
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,040
- For rich or for poor.
- For better or worse.

351
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:27,360
- In sickness and in health.
- Till death do us part.

352
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,320
- I do.
- So do I.

353
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,280

365
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,560
- Behind me you see those who
are protesting the pageant.

366
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:40,320
Fortune 500 company Hess
Ketchup is sponsoring the event

367
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,280
which has run afoul of
the local feminist groups.

I can see.

373
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,000
- [Announcer] Senator Kennedy,
please see the concierge

374
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,480

Senator Kennedy please.

376
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,320

before.

377
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,320
- Yes, you have.

378
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,520

Claire, Harper's Bazaar,

379
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,640
Elle, W Magazine, you name it.

380
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,720

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,480
makeup and hair that is.

(giggling)

386
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,640
- Well, that explains it, I
guess.

387
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,440

does, silly, we're famous.

398
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,840

(orchestral music)

400
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,160
- You failed me

401
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,960
and you know what happens
to people that fail me.

402
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,680
- They don't get dessert.

403
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,520
- They become off-ramps.

404
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,920
- Before or after dessert?

405
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,680
- That Ros-top-o-vitz can hang
me

406
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,840
as long as he has the book.

407
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,920
Find those two idiots and
bring me back the book.

408
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,440
- Maybe the guy doesn't
even know he has the book.

409
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,480
I've seen that guy somewhere
before.

410
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,040
- Of course you have you moron,

411
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,400
you ran into him and the other
guy.

412
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,000
- Bet I'd recognize him
again, even in disguise.

413
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,680
- Any idiot would recognize him.

414
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,880
- I'm not just any idiot, boss.

415
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,000
- Find him, bring him
back to me personally.

416
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,960
Now, get outta here.

417
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,160
I can turn my own pages.

418
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,600

- I'm not, I'm from Pa-coy-ma.

444
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,400
The Honduran tourist office
is paying me to do this

445
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,200

act.

446

You could say I'm an aspiring

It's time to go to bed.

Mr. Hess will expect to

455
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,360
tomorrow morning early.

456
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,920
He has turned over his guest

for your training and
preparation

458
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,720

the ones he wants to date.

459
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,160
And if you're thinking about
going out

460

without his permission, it won't
fly.

461
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,920
You're restricted to your rooms

462
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,480
and there's a garden every
corridor.

463
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,760
Now break it up.

Mr. Rupert Hess.

472
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,840
- I want to welcome you
all to the Hess Ketchup

473
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,720

476

00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,760
And now ladies, I have
a very important meeting

486
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,800
with the local mafia, but I
assure you

487
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,360
in the next couple of days,

488
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,880
we'll get to know each
other very well personally.

489
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,680
There'll be lunches,
dinners, nights on the town,

490
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:20,520
at the clubs, discos,
bars, the best restaurants,

491
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,400
the swimming in the jacuzzi.

492
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,400
You want it, you'll get it.

493
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,320
- Frank, Frank, don't be
strange.

494
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,280
- Why, what's wrong with me?

495
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,320
- Stop staring at that guy, are
you crazy?

496
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,560
- I'm not staring at
him, he's staring at me.

497
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,200
- I'm Rupert Hess.
- Charmed.

498
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,520
- I couldn't help watching
you from a distance.

499
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:13,880
I found you captivating,
fascinating, different

500
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,440
and so usually fully dressed.

501
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,560
- I'm only the makeup girl.

502
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,320
I'm a Pisces, would you
like to have fish with me?

503
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,160
- Is this a-

504
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,720
- Yes, an invitation to dinner.

505
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,520
I'll pick you up, say six-ish?

506
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,360
- Six-ish then.

507
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,760
- I'm Mirabelle.
- You're ugly.

508
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,200
If you want to have dinner
with her, she's yours.

509
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,720
- Thank you very much.

510
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,960
What am I, chopped liver?

511
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,680
- Leave me alone.

512
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,280
- Are you out of your fucking
mind?

513
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,640
- You're jealous.
- Jealous my ass.

514
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,000
You're going out to dinner with
a mobster dressed as a girl.

515
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,800
- He didn't say he was
going to dress as a girl.

516
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,120
- Don't get cute with me, Frank.

517
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,280
These damn clothes have started
to change your personality.

518
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,560
You're becoming Ethel.

519
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:18,000
- I don't have to stand
here and let you insult me.

520
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,880
- Oh no, what are you gonna do?

521
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:23,520
- Powder my nose?
- Frank, listen to me.

522
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,000
We're not women, we're men in
drag.

523
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,520
We did it out of desperation
following a twisted plot

524
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,840
and it's gotta end now.

525
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,160
We're getting out of these
dresses,

526
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,160
we're burning these wigs,

527
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,560
we're going back to what brought
us here in the first place.

528
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,240
- Right now the combination
of danger and sex

529
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,640
appeals to me more than money.

530
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,920
The hotel is paid for.

531
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,120
There's 10 gorgeous
half and or fully naked

532
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,120
women for the taking.

533
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,680
And I'm not walking away from
paradise

534
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,480
until either I'm dead or fully
satisfied.

535
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,720
- May I remind you that the
former

536
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,200
is a more than distinct
possibility

537
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,240
with a ruthless drug lord?

538
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,240
- Rupert?

539
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,120
Oh, he's a pussycat.

540
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,320
- Will you stop it?

541
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,680
Bruno's already killed
one man in cold blood.

542
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,800
- Then he'd already be racked by
guilt.

543
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,120
- Bruno doesn't feel any guilt

544
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,880
because he doesn't have a brain.

545
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,680
And when Rupert finds out
we're not who he thinks we are

546
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,520
we end up in some freeway off
ramp.

547
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,080
I say you make a run for it.

548
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,360
- I can't do that, Frank.
- Why the hell not, Frank?

549
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,280
- I have a date tonight.

550
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,040
- Well, don't expect
me to play bridesmaid.

551
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,000
I'm getting out of here.

552
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,840
- Mirabelle!

553
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,400
Silly girl.

554
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,680
(grunting)

555
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,160
- I called this meeting
because as you know

556
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,480
business is not exactly booming.

557
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,800
Elections are done,
illegal gambling is off

558
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,880
and the protection
racket is not performing

559
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,600
all because the old geezers
are not up to the job.

560
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,840
(buzzing)
(groaning)

561
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,600
Forget it, Miriam, I'm not
listening to any of your excuses

562
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,080
about weak kidneys, slipped
discs and arthritis.

563
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,320
I've heard it all before and to
be honest

564
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,200
to me it sounds like sheer
negativism.

565
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,880
Be aggressive.

566
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,400
Go out and kick some butt.

567
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,680
Now move it!

568
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,360

- I want to take a nap.
- Oh no you're not.

589
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,120
- Yeah, who's stopping me?

590
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,320
- Your big date with Mr. Rupert
Hess.

591
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:35,000
- Fuck.
- Never on the first date.

592
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,240
- I can do it.

593
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:41,920
Oh.

594
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:50,240
- Oh, no problem, Frank,
go ahead, take a nap.

595
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,520
Stand Rupert up, get him
pissed, get us both killed.

596
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,360
- Shut up.

597
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,240
I can do it.

598
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:58,920
I can do it.

599
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,040
I'll jump in the shower,
put some makeup on,

600
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,720
I'll feel like a brand
new woman in no time.

601
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,920
(snoring)

602
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,000
I can do it.

603
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,760
I can do it.

604
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,400
I can do it.

605
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,800
- Hi honey.

606
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,440
I hope you don't mind.

607
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,600
My roommate was using our tub

608
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,720
so I thought I might borrow
yours.

609
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,320
Well, don't just stand there.

610
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:34,400
Come on in and share while
the water's still warm.

611
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,840
- I can't do that.
- Don't tell me you're shy.

612
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:42,000
We're girls after all, come on
Ethel.

613
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,920
I'm straight.

614
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,040
Just take your clothes off and
jump in.

615
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,600
- I've never shared a
tub with another person.

616
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,640
You see, I never had a
boyfriend.

617
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,560
I'm sort of a loner, I guess.

618
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,440
- Oh, I'm sorry, honey.

619
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,680
Pretty girl like you.

620
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:10,680
Oops, girl, you're packing
more than you need, aren't you?

621
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,880
Aren't you, Frank?

622
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,040
- Okay, okay, what do you want
from me?

623
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,560
- What do you have to offer?

624
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,280
- My body.
- Lousy bargain.

625
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,560
- I look better without the
dress.

626
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,600
- Cut to the chase, Ethel.

627
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,640
- Call me Frank, Misty.

628
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,360
- The name's Joanne, Frank, I'm
a narc.

629
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,160
It's spelled FBI.

630
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:27,440
All these years of training
to make this body perfect

631
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,800
and seduce Hess and what
happens?

632
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:33,000
I get beaten out by a guy in
drag.

633
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,640
- Guess I've got that certain.

634
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,480
(speaking in foreign language)

635
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,000
- Sure you do, Frank.

636
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,360
That's why you, me and
your friend Mirabelle,

637
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,920
we girls are gonna work together

638
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,680
and put Rupert out of business.

639
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:48,600
Get a promotion, a raise even,
get a life.

640
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,160
- Hey, I'm not with the FBI.

641
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,600
- I'm talking about me, Frank,

642
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,520
you and the other Frank
will do the legwork.

643
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,600
Pardon the expression.

644
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,160
And I'll collect the benefits.

645
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,560
- What if I refuse?

646
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,840
- Nice try, Frank.

647
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:01,200
Think I got to be an agent by
accident?

648
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,680
I'll tell you why not.

649
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:06,000
Work with me you little
shit or you're dead!

650
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,080
Get it?

651
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:07,920
Good.

652
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,880
- Point made.

653
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,800
What do you want me to do?

654
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,880
- You will go to dinner with
Rupert.

655
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,800
You will go back home to his
mansion

656
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,320
and you will seduce him.

657
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,000
- Seduce him?
- I just said that.

658
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:18,800
- Seduce him?

659
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,640
- Frank, you're repeating
yourself.

660
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,960
You're not making any sense.

661
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,640
Okay, let's go.

662
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,920
- Wait a minute, what about
Grace Jones out there?

663
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,080
- Think I don't already
have that figured out?

664
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,360
Hey Sam!

665
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,440
- Hi Misty.
- Hi Sam.

666
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,080
- All's clear if you
want to see the chief.

667
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,240
- Thanks, catch you later.
- Bye.

668
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,440
See you, Frank.

669
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,240
Later, Frank.

670
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,000
- [Announcer] The special of
the day at the Hard Bread Cafe-

671
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,080
- Here's the deal.

672
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,160
See those?

673
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,560
They call them elevators.

674
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,360
- [Announcer] That's sprinkled
with crispy, crunchy sawdust.

675
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,640
Served with a generous
portion of yesterday's fries

676
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,640
and a slice of bed fly
infested watermelon.

677
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,160
It's a bargain at $32.99.

678
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,640
- Not this one.
- How do you know?

679
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,120
(tense music)

680
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,880
♪ Off we go, head to the wild ♪

681
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,040
- We're picking up the chief,
33rd floor.

682
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,400
- There's no 33rd floor.

683
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,640
- No chief either, hit 32, pal.

684
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:51,160
- 32.

685
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,680
Would you take 31?

686
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,440
(horns blowing)

687
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,720
(ominous music)

688
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,000
- Got a light?
- Sure, Chief.

689
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,840
- Thanks, but not while I'm on
duty.

690
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:40,360
Hello boys, or should I say
hello girls?

691
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,880
- Garcia, it's amazing you're
alive!

692
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,200
- No, name's not Garcia.

693
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,000
And yes, I'm alive.

694
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:51,560
Oh that, yeah, I got shot
point blank, that's right.

695
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,760
Bulletproof vest.

696
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,600
- What the hell is that for?

697
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,320
- This is supposed to
be an express elevator.

698
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,640
- No stops.

699
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,400
(gun shooting)

700
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,560
- You just shot a little old
lady!

00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,840
- Yes I did.

702
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,040
That wasn't a little old lady.

703
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,960
Rupert's spies are all around.

704
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,680
Word gets out I'm alive,

705
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,720
might as well kiss the plan
goodbye.

706
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,800
- Now listen, Garcia.

707
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,800
- Gesundheim.
- I didn't sneeze.

708
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,440
- No, his name's not
Garcia, it's Gesundheim.

709
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:36,040
(cameras snapping)

710
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,800
- Yes, I know what you're
thinking.

711
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,600
But that book I placed on you
was a phony.

712
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,920
Wanted Hess to think we
had the goods on him.

713
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,160
Yes, it is an ingenious plan.

714
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,880
No, I still can't arrest him.

715
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,640
Got a payroll a mile long,

716
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:58,080
cops, judges, the mayor, city
council,

717
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,920
garbage men, senior citizens,

718
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,960
even the God damn illegal
aliens.

719
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,920
You know the name 'em,
they're all on the take.

720
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,280
- The overhead will kill him.

721
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,320
- No, I'd rather kill him
myself.

722
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:10,320
No, I can't get my hands on him
legally.

723
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,880
And yes, you will help me.

724
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,200
- No, we won't.
- And yes, you're crazy.

725
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,920
- You don't have a choice.
- We know who you are.

726
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,280
We got a hold of all your
unpaid parking tickets

727
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,520
in six states.

728
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,320
We also know that you are
aspiring actors.

729
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:28,080
- What we really want to
do is write and direct.

730
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,960
- You will never work in this
town again

731
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,520
unless you go along with my
plan.

732
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,440
- What do you want from us?

733
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,280
- Let's go have a bite,
they've got a free breakfast.

734
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,560
- But it's after 5:30.

735
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,320
- Now you understand why it's
free.

736
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,880
(helicopters chopping)

737
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:33,760
- Well, don't just stand
there, Ethel, come on.

738
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,680
You look ravishing.

739
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,960
- You're very handsome yourself,
Mr. Hess.

740
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,280
So where are we going tonight?

741
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,880
- I will fly you to the moon,
Ethel.

742
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,600
- Oh my, I thought we were
going to your house for dinner.

743
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,440
- I prepared something rather
exclusive.

744
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:55,360
By the way, it's a mansion, not
a house.

745
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,200
- Sorry.

746
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,240
(adventurous music)

747
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,880
Why three helicopters, Rupert?

748
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:22,000
- You must be wondering, why
three helicopters, Rupert?

749
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,320
- You read my mind.

750
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,840
- Decoys, if anybody gets any
ideas

751
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,920
they won't know who to shoot
down first.

752
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,080
(gulping)

753
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,200
You like rollercoaster, Ethel?

754
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,440
- They make me dizzy, I lose
control.

755
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,280
- Good!

756
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,040
You like speed, Ethel?

757
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,440
You like ecstasy?

758
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,240
- I don't do drugs, Rupert.

759
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:56,840
- I'm talking real ecstasy,
Ethel, real orgasmic speed.

760
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,520
(screaming)

761
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:09,520
I love it!

762
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,920
(upbeat music)

763
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:41,400
- Pardon me, would you
have any Gray Poupon?

764
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,240
- What?

765
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:46,320
- I said pardon me, would
you have any Gray Poupon?

766
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,440
- But of course!

767
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,920
(glass breaking)

768
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:21,240
(helicopter crashing)

769
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,920
Ethel?
- Yes, Rupert?

770
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:26,160
- You see all this?
- Yes, Rupert.

771
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,040
- [Rupert] All mine.

772
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:31,480
This building over there, mine.

773
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:34,360
That other one, mine.

774
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:37,880
I own the biggest buildings in
town.

775
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,040
- [Ethel] Like they say, Rupert,

776
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:42,560
a man's building is an
extension of his far-feg-nu-gen.

777
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:48,120
- [Rupert] Ethel, you're so
intelligent, so shocked, so-

778
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:50,360
- [Ethel] Take your hand
off my knee, Rupert.

779
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,480
- Nice to see you again, Mr.
Hess.

780
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:26,680
New girlfriend?

781
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:27,960
- Yes, another one.

782
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,640
- We're really just
acquaintances.

783
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,680
- The usual?
- Please.

784
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,040
- And what about you, slut?

785
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,520
- Cristal, please.

786
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:49,440
- Oh, that's a first,
a slut with good taste.

787
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,080
- What a rude woman.

788
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,160
- Camille?

789
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,480
She's a putz.

790
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,760
Enough about her, let's talk
about us.

791
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:01,760
(upbeat rock music)

792
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,440
- So, what'll it be, my man?

793
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:19,680
- Black Russian?

794
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,440
- No, I just have sort of a tan.

795
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,920
What would you like?

796
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,440
- Bud Light.
- You got it.

797
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:32,680
- Do I know you?

798
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:36,320
- [Electronic Voice] Play dumb,
Frank.

799
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:39,040
- I don't think so, why?

800
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,720
- I got a really lousy memory.

801
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:44,640
I always ask people if I
know them, you look familiar.

802
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,040
You sure we haven't met before?

803
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,520
- Oh, I'm positive.

804
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:50,560
- I'm AB negative.

805
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,160
- Hey, this is empty.

806
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,760
- Why do you think they call it
light?

807
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:02,280
So Bruno, you kill anybody
today?

808
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,840
- Nah, pretty quiet.

809
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,480
- The usual?
- Yeah.

810
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:15,040
(glass chewing)

811
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,200
- No thanks, I'm trying to cut
down.

812
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:31,680
(yawning)

813
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,240
- And now let's talk about you.

814
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,840
- Me?
- Yes, about you.

815
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:40,760
You exude wit, charm, class.

816
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:44,080
I'm fascinated by you for
some unexplained reason.

817
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:47,120
There's a kind of charisma about
you

818
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,480
that makes me forget all my good
taste

819
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:52,000
and very high aesthetic
sensibilities.

820
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,200
I would walk to the ends of
the Earth for a girl like you.

821
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:57,840
So what do you say, Ethel,

822
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:59,480
you want to go back to the
mansion, have sex with me?

823
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:01,600
- Oh, I don't know, Rupert.

824
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:02,960
You're so fierce.

825
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:05,720
I need time, I need to get to
know you.

826
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:07,960
(cheering)

827
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:19,760
- I don't know what it is
about you, but I like you.

828
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,720
I feel I know you.

829
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:25,040
I'll tell you what, let's be
buddies.

830
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:26,680
Let's have some fun, what do you
say?

831
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:29,160
- [Electronic Voice]
Not a good idea, Frank.

832
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:30,840
- I don't think so.

833
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:31,760
- Good!

834
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,120
Drinks are on me, smiley.

835
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,080
- Can you do me a favor, Rupert?

836
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:40,600
- Anything, Ethel.

837
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:43,680
- Helicopters turn me
off, let's take your car.

838
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:48,680
- Of course, by the way,
it's not a car, it's a limo.

839
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:49,760
- Sorry.

840
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:57,960
No, Rupert don't.

841
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:00,640
You overwhelm little girls,
throw them off balance.

842
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,280
I need a little romance.

843
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:03,920
- Romance, you want romance?

844
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,040
I'll give you romance.

845
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:05,920
Driver, pull over.

846
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,040
Hey bro, come here!

847
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:18,120
- Good evening, sir.

848
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:19,040
- Excuse me, my good man.

849
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,800
I'll take all the flowers you
have.

850
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:24,400
- Now I want all your money,
motherfucker.

851
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,440
- Don't hurt me.

852
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:26,600
I'll give you anything you want.

853
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:29,440
My money, my credit cards, the
car, her.

854
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,560
- Leave me out of this.

855
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:32,640
- Okay, I'll take the
money and the credit cards,

856
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,880
you can keep the car, too
big, lousy on gas mileage.

857
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,640
But this little bitch is mine.

858
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:38,480
- [Ethel] What?

859
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,720
(punching)

860
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:55,200
- You see, Frank, I don't
usually have this much fun.

861
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,320
My social life stinks.

862
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:00,000
Got a few problems, know what I
mean?

863
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,080
Like these guys I gotta kill,

864
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:06,400
one of them is about your
height, same eyes, same hair.

865
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,240
Practically looks like you.

866
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,200
The other guy I don't remember
too good

867
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,960
because he had this camera
in front of his face.

868
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,800
My boss says if I don't
get them, he'll get me.

869
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:18,200
Problem is, I don't know where
they are.

870
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:19,080
So look at me.

871
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:21,400
- [Electronic Voice] Look at
him, Frank.

872
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:24,120
- Do I look like a dead man to
you?

873
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:26,880
Damn right I'm not.

874
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,120
Know why?

875
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:30,080
Because tomorrow I'm going to
Mexico

876
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:33,200
with a bunch of bimbos
for a major drug deal.

877
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,640
And it's splits-ville for yours
truly.

878
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:38,400
A place for Rupert Hess can
never find me

879
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,000
and I can live happily ever.

880
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:43,400
- You're doing the right thing,
Bruno.

881
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:46,400
(crickets chirping)

882
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:10,600
- Will that be all, sir?

883
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:11,840
- No, that will not be all.

884
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:16,760
I'm paying you good money so
stay in the car until you die.

885
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,480
I'm sure you'll understand why I
bring you

886
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,800
straight to the guest house,
Ethel.

887
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,520
The mansion is a total mess

888
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:27,000
let alone that my wife would
divorce me

889
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,800
and take all my money
if she saw me with you.

890
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:29,640
- Your wife?

891
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:32,720
(speaker voice muffled)

892
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:33,560
- Yes.

893
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,040
- Thank you for a wonderful
evening, good night.

894
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:48,920
- Ethel.
- Yes, Rupert?

895
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:51,640
- I'll be Frank.
- No, I'll be Frank.

896
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:52,920
- Such a kidder.

897
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:54,400
Ethel.
- Yes, Rupert.

898
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,360
- I want you to know I feel
like we know each other

899
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,480
for a long time.

900
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:02,320
There's something about you,
I can't put my finger on it.

901
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:03,760
- You wouldn't want to do that.

902
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,880
- You're not like the other
girls.

903
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,400
- Well that's true.

904
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:10,840
- You're strong, you've got
balls.

905
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:12,480
- That I've got.

906
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,160
- The way you handled that
little crisis tonight,

907
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:17,920
the way your body feels,

908
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:22,080
so well-built and yet, so, so
feminine.

909
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:25,320
I don't want you to rush into
anything you don't want to do

910
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:26,680
so I'll give you 10 minutes to
shower

911
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:28,720
and slip into something more
comfortable.

912
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:35,080
(breath freshener spraying)

913
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:49,040
(kissing)

914
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,040
I'm a sucker for tough broads.

915
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:58,160
(clapping)
(soft music)

916
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:05,400
- Pretty kinky, huh?

917
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,040
- Here's your male accessories.

918
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:15,920
How'd it go?

919
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,400
- Fine, Sam.

920
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,040
You sure you want to go through
with this?

921
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:22,960
- I have a job to do and
I'll do it, for Misty

922
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:27,240
for the agency, and for America.

923
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:34,080
But mainly for me, I haven't
had a man in such a long time.

924
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:42,680
(door knocking)

925
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:44,600
- Has it been 10 minutes
already?

926
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:47,800
- I wanted to surprise you.
- Naughty boy.

927
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:50,000
Count to 3,000, then come in.

928
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:56,280
- One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, 10,

929
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:02,680
11, 12, 13, 14, I cheated.

930
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:12,880
(breath freshener spraying)

931
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:17,880
Ethel, Ethel, it's time
to meet Long Dong Silver.

932
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,000
(singing)

933
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,080
Ow, oh fuck.

934
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:25,440
Rupee's here.

935
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:28,120
Ethel, oh, oh Ethel.

936
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:34,480
What a body, all those muscles,
you're a big, bad mama.

937
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:38,160
Little Rupert wants big
bad mama to spank him.

938
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,480
Spank little Rupert.

939
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:45,480
(spanking)
(orchestral music)

940
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:01,200
- [Computer] I have
voice recognition, silly.

941
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:05,360
- Ready.

942
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:09,200
(video game music)

943
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,200
Damn.

944
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:13,800
- [Computer] Are you sure?

945
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:14,680
- Shut up.

946
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:16,600
- [Computer] Oh, beat me, whip
me,

947
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:17,920
make me write bad checks.

948
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:22,280
(upbeat tropical music)

949
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:41,880
- Bye!

950
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:54,440
(people shouting)

951
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:04,000
(water flowing)

952
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:56,120
(whistling)

953
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:05,040
- Frank, meet Ramirez, Ramirez,
Frank.

954
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:06,960
Ramirez, Frank, Frank, Ramirez.

955
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,480
- Ramirez, he couldn't
make it, I am Gonzales.

956
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:35,680
- I can't believe it.

957
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:38,320
Months of planning that
operation and that goon Bruno

958
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:40,720
goes and spills his guts to
him in a cheap strip joint.

959
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,960
- Oh, make me feel sleazy, why
don't you?

960
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:45,560
I wouldn't call it cheap, tacky
maybe.

961
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:48,400
(Frank screaming)

962
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:53,600
- What now, ride too rough for
you?

963
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:56,160
- My tooth, killing me.

964
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:57,920
- Transparent decoy to weasel
out.

965
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,480
We've got a rendezvous to make.

966
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:02,360
- They'll hear us miles
away, we better drop him off.

967
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:03,360
- Or find a dentist.

968
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:04,920
- Where are we gonna
find a dentist out here?

969
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:06,600
(speaking in foreign language)

970
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:08,640
- My brother-in-law, he is a
dentist.

971
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:10,160
- What kind of dentist?

972
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:11,280
- Beggars can't be choosers.

973
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:12,240
Hit it, Ramirez.

974
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:14,040
- Remember I'm Gonzales.

975
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:29,640
- [Announcer] Dr. Kill-dare
to proctology please,

976
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:31,840
Dr. Kill-dare to proctology.

977
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:38,800
Dr. Bones to orthopedics, Dr.
Bones to orthopedics, please.

978
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:42,920
(dentist spitting)

979
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:46,680
Dr. Milan to radiology,
Dr. Milan to radiology.

980
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:49,600
(speaker voice muffled)
(Frank screaming)

981
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:50,960
- Now say E.

982
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:54,880
Senor, you have a severe
eyesight problem.

983
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:56,280
I'm going to have to
give you a prescription

984
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:57,600
for a pair of glasses.

985
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:58,880
- There's nothing wrong with my
eyesight.

986
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,040
It's my tooth that's killing me.

987
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:02,680
- I know, it is my professional
opinion

988
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:04,360
that you have a bad tooth.

989
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:06,640
- I know that, which one?

990
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:08,320
- That one, senor.

991
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:09,440
- What can you do about it?

992
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:12,200
- Well, I can give you a filling
for $25

993
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:15,680
or I can give you a root canal
for $100.

994
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:17,480
(cash register ringing)

995
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:19,240
That's it, you need a root
canal.

996
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:21,480
- A hundred dollars, are
you out of your mind?

997
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:23,400
- Si, senor, but that's
not the question here.

998
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:26,200
- It's outrageous, I'm
not paying more than $30.

999
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:27,400
- 60 dollars.
- 35.

1000
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:28,240
- 55.
- Ow, God!

1001
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,520
- That hurt, senor?
- Yes.

1002
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:33,840
- Alright, 50 dollars.

1003
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:34,920
- I don't have the cash.

1004
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:37,800
- It's alright, I take American
Express.

1005
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:41,040
(credit card machine swiping)

1006
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:44,920
Now take two strong drags,
senor, two big ones.

1007
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:48,600
(deep breathing)

1008
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:03,840
(laughing)

1009
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:22,840
Senor, do you floss?

1010
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:31,120
(drill spinning)

1011
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:59,680
(soft music)

1012
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:08,640
For another 50 bucks,
I'll give you these free.

1013
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:10,600
When the pain comes, you just
inhale.

1014
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:11,440
- Good deal.

1015
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,600
(jungle music)

1016
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,440
- Rupert's planning to take
delivery

1017
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:21,120
of this shipment personally,

1018
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:23,680
the question is how big is the
shipment?

1019
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:24,880
- How big?

1020
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,520
- Mind your own business,
Gonzales.

1021
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:28,680
The other question is how is he
planning

1022
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:30,360
to smuggling it back into the
country?

1023
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:32,920
- How?
- Gonzales, shut up and drive.

1024
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:39,200
(exploding)

1025
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:48,600
(tropical music)

1026
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:02,640
(elephant trumpeting)

1027
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:12,560
What are we waiting for?

1028
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:20,120
(traffic light ringing)

1029
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:20,960
Let's go.

1030
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:39,280
- From here we walk.

1031
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:41,720
- Walk, you expect me to walk?

1032
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:43,480
I'm not even getting paid for
this.

1033
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:40,040
(singing in foreign language)

1034
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:13,480
(speaking in foreign language)

1035
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:22,120
(soft music)

1036
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:36,880
- This is it.

1037
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,360
Worth about 60 million we hear.

1038
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:39,600
- Strange.
- What?

1039
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:41,520
- I don't see Rupert anywhere.

1040
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:42,800
- That is strange.

1041
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:44,120
- Maybe he's on the plane.

1042
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:46,000
- Or maybe he's right behind
you.

1043
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,880
- Nah, couldn't be.
- Yes, it could.

1044
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:50,520
- No, it couldn't.
- Could too.

1045
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:52,760
- Who's voice is that?

1046
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:54,280
- Not mine.
- Or mine.

1047
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:58,200
- Gonzalez, you a
ventriloquist or something?

1048
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:06,080
Thank God, I thought it was
hallucinating.

1049
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:09,160
- Thank you, Gonzalez, here's
your money.

1050
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:10,440
- Gracias, hombre.

1051
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:12,040
I don't need to count it, I
trust you.

1052
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:14,240
- Gonzales, you slime ball.

1053
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:15,360
You'll pay for this.

1054
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:19,440
- Si senorita, home loan, car
payment,

1055
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:21,720
put my kids through college.

1056
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:22,920
- Drop your weapons.

1057
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:25,440
(tense music)

1058
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:38,880
As they say in my country.

1059
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:40,600
(speaking in foreign language)

1060
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:43,040
- I bet that means two birds
with one stone in German.

1061
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:44,400
- Your linguistic skills won't
be enough

1062
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:46,320
to save you, Mr. Guggenheimer.

1063
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:47,560
Search them.

1064
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:51,280
- Get your hands off me.

1065
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:52,520
Don't touch me.

1066
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:07,520
- Why do you look so familiar to
me?

1067
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:09,560
- What about me, don't I look
familiar?

1068
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:12,120
- You look ugly, but Mr.
Guggenheimer here

1069
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:14,320
is very, very familiar.

1070
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:17,600
Just can't put my finger on it.

1071
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:23,960
Good job, boys.

1072
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:28,080
- Waste of a good body to be
working

1073
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:29,600
for the Federal Bureau of
Incompetence.

1074
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:32,120
- You won't get away with this,
Hess.

1075
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:33,920
- How old are you, my dear?

1076
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:35,520
- 25 next month.

1077
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:38,600
- I'm afraid we'll have to
sing "Happy Birthday" now

1078
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:40,840
as you won't be around next
month.

1079
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:43,000
Boys.

1080
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:50,080
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

1081
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:54,160
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

1082
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:57,720
♪ Happy birthday dear Misty ♪

1083
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:01,040
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

1084
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,160
(blowing)

1085
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:10,480
- I get it, thanks.

1086
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:11,440
You're all so nice.

1087
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:17,800
- You'll never get me, you know.

1088
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:19,800
There's no trail, no evidence.

1089
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:22,320
You'll have to nail me on a
cheap technicality like a pawn.

1090
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:24,760
Put them on the plane.

1091
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:27,120
I personally will fly you to
10,000 feet

1092
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:30,840
and drop you off so to speak.

1093
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:31,800
Have a nice flight.

1094
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:37,800
By the way, your guess
was way off, I'm hurt.

1095
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:40,840
The street value of this
cocaine was 110 million.

1096
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:46,720
(propeller spinning)

1097
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:52,840
(adventurous music)

1098
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:05,040
(singing in foreign language)

1099
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:15,960
- Hi guys!

1100
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:21,400
- Mind pointing those things
somewhere besides my face?

1101
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:23,160
One of them might go off.

1102
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:24,000
- We'll shoot you anyway.

1103
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,440
- Oh, that's not what Mr. Hess
says.

1104
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:26,880
He says we're getting
dropped into the jungle

1105
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:28,360
from 10,000 feet.

1106
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:29,720
Isn't that right, gang?

1107
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:35,880
Thanks.

1108
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:43,880
- If we ever get out of this,
I'll make it up to you guys.

1109
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:46,000
- [Frank] I think I
know a way out of this.

1110
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,440
- Yeah, right.

1111
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:50,240
- Remember the laughing
gas the dentist gave me?

1112
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:53,120
- Of course, it's brilliant.

1113
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:56,400
- When I say now, take a
deep breath and hold it.

1114
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:58,280
- Now wait a minute, Frank.
- Now!

1115
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:01,800
(gas hissing)

1116
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:09,160
(laughing)

1117
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:46,400
(sniffing)

1118
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:53,400
(speaking in foreign language)

1119
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:56,160
(engine revving)

1120
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:04,240
- Shut up, shut up and sit down!

1121
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:45,720
- Oh shit!

1122
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:49,800
- Get the wheel, Frank.

1123
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:51,720
- Wheel, get the wheel.

1124
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:06,520
- You asshole, this is
tremendous fun.

1125
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:08,040
- Enjoy it, Rupert!

1126
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:10,160
You're gonna laugh.
- That's funny.

1127
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:11,440
You wanna kill me?

1128
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:12,280
Hilarious!

1129
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:16,680
Because I'd like to kill you but
I can't!

1130
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:17,480
- Ditto!

1131
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:22,600
- Get the wheel!

1132
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:23,760
Get the wheel!

1133
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:30,000
(ominous music)

1134
01:10:57,480 --> 01:10:58,480
- [Frank] That's a new jacket,
Rupert.

1135
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:00,640
- Khaki's not your color.

1136
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:03,960
- So you want to tell me how you
do it?

1137
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:05,200
- Do what?

1138
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:07,280
- Get the drugs to L.A.

1139
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:09,840
- Over my dead body.
- Okay.

1140
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:14,880
- No, don't drop me, pull me in.

1141
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:16,400
I'll tell you everything you
want to know.

1142
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:18,720
- Okay, talk.

1143
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:21,120
- The girls, from the beauty
pageant.

1144
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:24,320
The luggage, we add a piece to
each one.

1145
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:27,680
Customs won't check, they're
celebrities.

1146
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:31,200
11 suitcases filled
with Columbia's finest.

1147
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:33,440
- He's lying.
- Are you lying, Rupert?

1148
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:35,280
- I swear to you, I'm
telling you the truth.

1149
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:37,320
- The whole truth?
- And nothing but the truth.

1150
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:39,800
- So help you God?
- Don't push it.

1151
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:42,720
(Rupert screaming)

1152
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:48,000
- Don't forget to write!

1153
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,480
(tense music)

1154
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:59,120
(men screaming)

1155
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:18,120
(body crashing)

1156
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:21,640
- [Rupert] Thank God I'm alive,
I'm alive!

1157
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:25,240
All I have to do is find
a cellular phone, right?

1158
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:26,520
Nothing can go wrong now.

1159
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:35,560
- We gotta land this thing.

1160
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:36,720
- No shit, Jose,

1161
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:38,120
except for the fact that we
don't know how

1162
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:39,200
and we're out of gas.

1163
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:41,360
- Why are you always
so hung up on details?

1164
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:05,600
Leave it here, will you, buddy?

1165
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:11,920
(alarm beeping)

1166
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:15,440
(upbeat music)

1167
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:25,480
(phone ringing)

1168
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:27,280
- Congratulations, Misty.

1169
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:29,520
Did the two bums cooperate?

1170
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:31,520
- The two bums are
sitting right next to me

1171
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:33,400
and yes they did cooperate.

1172
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:34,960
I couldn't have done it without
them.

1173
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:37,200
- Thank you, thank you.
- It was nothing really.

1174
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:39,200
- You know, you all amaze me.

1175
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:40,440
You uncovered Rupert's plan,

1176
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:41,920
you followed him to the
Caribbean,

1177
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:43,720
you bound him loading a
hundred million dollars

1178
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:45,440
worth of cocaine onto a plane,

1179
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:47,320
you got shoved around by a
bunch of Colombian thugs.

1180
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:49,480
- Cut to the chase,
Chief, we know all that.

1181
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:51,160
- To make a long story short

1182
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:52,680
you managed to get rid of the
thugs.

1183
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:55,320
You landed the plane and you
delivered to the authorities.

1184
01:13:55,320 --> 01:14:00,240
260 pounds of pure powdered
sugar.

1185
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:05,120
- Funny, Chief.
- Yeah, what a kidder.

1186
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:06,480
- This is powdered sugar.

1187
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:14,120
- He isn't kidding, it's
powdered sugar alright.

1188
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:17,200
- Which brings us to a dead
end for this investigation

1189
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:20,000
as a single question looms
towards us.

1190
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:24,760
Don't go away, we'll be back.

1191
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:26,320
- [Woman] Damn, they have
all these commercials.

1192
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:27,960
The bureau must be desperate.

1193
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:28,800
- Did I hear right?

1194
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:30,880
You said you got rid of the
thugs.

1195
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:33,680
- So?
- He didn't mention Rupert.

1196
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:35,320
- We got rid of Rupert, right?

1197
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:36,160
- Yes, sir.

1198
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:37,360
He went down like a bullet.

1199
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:38,720
- This is a sad day for the
Bureau.

1200
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:42,080
We lost our only chance
to put Rupert away.

1201
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:45,280
- Not so fast, Chief, Rupert
took a dive in 20,000 feet

1202
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:46,600
and no parachute.

1203
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:48,880
- That lake full of
alligators broke his fall.

1204
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:50,120
- How come he wasn't eaten
alive?

1205
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:52,440
- Would you eat a German?

1206
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:56,160
- Chief, before you go,
Rupert can only trick us once.

1207
01:14:56,160 --> 01:14:58,040
That powdered sugar gag was
clever

1208
01:14:58,040 --> 01:14:59,840
but we will find the cocaine

1209
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:01,720
and we will put him away for
good.

1210
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:04,480
- You better, my retirement
plan depends on it.

1211
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:07,520
I'm supposed to surrender
my badge next week

1212
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:10,200
and start a phone sex 900
service.

1213
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:13,000
Do your best.
- We will, Chief.

1214
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:16,240
A great man, great agent.

1215
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:17,400
30 years with the force

1216
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:20,280
and he's giving it all up for
the good clean, quiet life.

1217
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:26,760
- [Rupert] Ladies and gentlemen.

1218
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:27,600
(speaking in foreign language)

1219
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:29,880
- Miss Young Yugoslavia.

1220
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:33,240
Monique Perrier, Ms. Fiery
France.

1221
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:37,320
Maria Conchita Reyes,
Miss Bodacious Bolivia.

1222
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:40,080
Rica Goulash, Miss Hungary
Hungary.

1223
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:43,960
Tor-ota Kra-kova, Miss Polluted
Poland.

1224
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:45,960
(woman screaming)

1225
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:48,760
Simone Linguini, Miss Idyllic
Italy.

1226
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:53,440
Marcia Marciano, Miss Horny
Honduras.

1227
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:56,480
Rosanne Ca-ta-na-ra, Ms.
Spanking Spain.

1228
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:01,160
Lily Vanilli Hussein, Miss Irate
Iraq.

1229
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:03,840
And last but not least,
Mari-qui-at Del Castro Vi-dal,

1230
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:04,960
Miss Curvaceous Cuba.

1231
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:11,240
Unfortunately we seem to be
missing our very own Miss Texas

1232
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:15,760
but as they say in my
country, the show must go on.

1233
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:19,160
(romantic music)

1234
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:21,120
Thank you, ladies.

1235
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:22,800
I will discuss with myself

1236
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:25,400
and will come up with the
results later.

1237
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:29,040
Now, go on and meet
interesting old people.

1238
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:30,360
Go, go, go, go.

1239
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:34,360
- You can go in, slut.

1240
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:38,840
- Thank you ever so much.

1241
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:40,920
- The boss' main squeeze.

1242
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:48,480
(classical music)

1243
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:25,400
- Well look for evidence.

1244
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:26,960
Check every room.

1245
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:28,680
- What are we looking for?

1246
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:29,600
- Evidence!

1247
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,760
(women laughing)

1248
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:53,240
- I absolutely refuse to
believe bodies like this

1249
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:54,640
exist in real life.

1250
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:55,480
- Freeze!

1251
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:56,320
- I've done that already.

1252
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:59,280
- Okay, right now, put
your head over your hands.

1253
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:01,720
Or was it the other way around?

1254
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:03,680
- It's definitely the other way
around.

1255
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:06,720
See?
- Okay, okay.

1256
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:08,200
Now drop your gun.

1257
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:12,440
- You drop your gun.
- No, you drop your gun.

1258
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:14,160
- No, you drop your gun.

1259
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:17,320
I work for the Bolivian
government.

1260
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:20,680
- Drop your gun.
- Buddy, drop your gun.

1261
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:22,920
- Hey, Bruno, good to see you,
guy.

1262
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:24,720
- Not good for you, moron.

1263
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:26,560
I ain't working for Rupert
anymore.

1264
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:28,000
- What do you mean, you quit?

1265
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,640
- I'm a born again Christian
now.

1266
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:32,240
There's too much brutality on
the streets,

1267
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:34,680
too much domestic violence,

1268
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:37,040
too much gratuitous sex.

1269
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:40,320
I've decided to help society

1270
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:42,640
and put a stop to all of the
above.

1271
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:45,240
This is a handgun destined
to defend law and order.

1272
01:18:45,240 --> 01:18:46,800
It will not confiscate it.

1273
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:49,240
- Thank you.
- Use it wisely.

1274
01:18:49,240 --> 01:18:50,760
Do not hurt the innocent.

1275
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:51,600
- I won't.

1276
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:54,160
Your shining example is an
inspiration to all agents.

1277
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:56,200
- Frank Two!
- Bruno!

1278
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:57,800
You didn't go to Mexico after
all.

1279
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:00,680
- Changed my mind, I'm not
really the marrying type.

1280
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:02,160
You saved me from sin.

1281
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:04,760
I owe you my soul, my very
existence.

1282
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:06,040
- Let's not exaggerate.

1283
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:09,800
- Do your duty, apprehend
Rupert, I'll testify.

1284
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:12,360
I've got my own Witness
Protection Program.

1285
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:13,240
I've rounded up the guards

1286
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:15,280
and put them in a room where
they're watching Oprah.

1287
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:16,640
I'll take these people,

1288
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:19,640
then watch Geraldo while
you're taking care of Rupert.

1289
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:21,760
- I'll talk to the chief
and recommend a pardon.

1290
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:23,920
Let's go, Frank, Ethel needs us.

1291
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:27,400
Ms. Bolivia, or should I say

1292
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:29,800
Agent Maria Conchita
Alvarez Fernando Guava

1293
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:32,080
Santa Maria Venezuela Del
Carmen.

1294
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:34,320
(speaking in foreign language)

1295
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:36,600
- Just call me Maria.
- Okay.

1296
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:41,400
- Excuse me.

1297
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:47,280
Hello, Rupert.
- Ethel.

1298
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:49,200
I thought-
- You thought I ran.

1299
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:51,360
- This has nothing to do with
Iran.

1300
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:52,760
I thought you disappeared.

1301
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:56,600
Ethel, let me introduce you to
my wife.

1302
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:59,400
- Your wife?
- Of course, it's good for PR.

1303
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:02,040
- And me Rupert, what
was I, a passing fling?

1304
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:06,040
- Are you two romantically
involved?

1305
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:07,200
- More or less.

1306
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:09,560
- More than less.

1307
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:12,640
I must admit I have a mad crush
on Ethel.

1308
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:17,640
- Well, Rupert, in that
case, I want a divorce.

1309
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:20,640
I'll take all your money,

1310
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:25,120
the house, the plane, the boat,
the condo in Palm Springs,

1311
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:28,600
the SL 500 and the
Porsche, the big screen TV

1312
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:31,080
and the beach house in Malibu.

1313
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:35,800
- Ethel, if I divorce
her, will you marry me?

1314
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:37,160
- I can't marry you, Rupert.

1315
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:38,880
The FBI says you're a drug lord.

1316
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:40,520
- What's wrong with a title?

1317
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:42,320
- They also say you've just lost

1318
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:43,880
a hundred million
dollars worth of cocaine.

1319
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:45,360
- Win some, lose some.

1320
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:48,600
I still have enough to
buy you a wonderful life.

1321
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:49,880
- Cocaine, which turned out to
be

1322
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:51,160
nothing but powdered sugar.

1323
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:52,560
- It was?

1324
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:54,280
Very amusing for the Colombians

1325
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:56,400
But then I paid them in
counterfeit money.

1326
01:20:57,920 --> 01:20:58,760
(sneezing)

1327
01:20:58,760 --> 01:20:59,880
Oh, gesundheit.

1328
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:03,320
- Well, you recognize me, Hess.

1329
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:05,480
- Gesundheim.
- Thanks again.

1330
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:08,520
- You're under arrest.
- For what crime may I ask?

1331
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:11,120
- Illegal drug trafficking,

1332
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:13,160
manufacture of phony currency,

1333
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:15,080
conspiracy to sell 10 young
ladies

1334
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:17,000
into the Middle East slave trade

1335
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,720
and wearing such a ridiculous
tuxedo.

1336
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:20,720
- Let me introduce you to

1337
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:23,120
some very important
people, Mr. Gesundheim.

1338
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:25,920
This is my attorney, Mr.
Herskovitz

1339
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:27,520
of Herskovitz and Herskovitz.

1340
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:29,720
$375 an hour.
- Pleasure.

1341
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:30,800
- For you perhaps.

1342
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:31,840
- This is my other attorney.

1343
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:33,800
Mr. Von Bulow of Bulow and
Bulow.

1344
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:36,960
$465 an hour.
- Pleasure.

1345
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:40,400
And these other people, all of
them are my other attorneys,

1346
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:44,040
ranging from $275 to $500 an
hour.

1347
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:45,800
Do you think you can
make this stick in court?

1348
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:47,880
- You have no witnesses.
- You have no evidence.

1349
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:49,760
- [All] You have no confession.

1350
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:50,680
- And even if you did

1351
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:52,520
it would have been obtained
under duress.

1352
01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:53,920
- You have no search warrant.

1353
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:56,400
- And having no warrant
you are here illegally

1354
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:58,320
and trespassing on private
property.

1355
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:01,040
All your claims are
therefore null and or voit.

1356
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:02,360
- Voit?
- Yeah, voit.

1357
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:04,600
- He means void.

1358
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:06,280
All of the above without
prejudice

1359
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:08,480
to our client's rights
and remedies at law.

1360
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:11,040
- We will sue the Bureau for $10
million.

1361
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:15,760
- Plus reasonable attorney's
fees and legal expenses.

1362
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:18,240
- Rupert, I think this is
disgusting.

1363
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:21,880
Your knee high in crime,
divorce and lawyers.

1364
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:23,240
I'm leaving you forever.

1365
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:26,480
- Ethel, Ethel, come back.

1366
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:29,880
- [Ethel] Leave me alone,
Rupert!

1367
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:34,880
(water splashing)
(people screaming)

1368
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:41,680
- [Woman] He used to beat me,
then he put salt on my wounds.

1369
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:44,880
I kind of liked it although
they say salt is bad for you.

1370
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:47,040
- Ethel, don't leave me.

1371
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:49,400
- Goodbye Rupert, I'm leaving
you forever.

1372
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:54,800
- Don't scratch the car!

1373
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:56,560
- Go fuck yourself, you cheap
shit.

1374
01:22:58,200 --> 01:23:01,000
- What a woman, what a dynamite
female.

1375
01:23:06,920 --> 01:23:11,920
(upbeat music)
(tires screeching)

1376
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:31,720
- Attention all units,
I'm in pursuit of suspect

1377
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:34,280
chasing a male prostitute in a
stolen car.

1378
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:36,160
Gonna get the honky too.

1379
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:40,960
(siren wailing)

1380
01:23:57,880 --> 01:24:00,480
(horn honking)

1381
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:06,640
- Ethel, Ethel, Ethel, stop!

1382
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:09,200
- Make me.

1383
01:24:15,240 --> 01:24:19,680
- [Cop] Hey bro, we're with
you, let's get the honky.

1384
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:29,920
- Ethel, don't be silly!

1385
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:32,240
Don't throw away such a
magnificent opportunity!

1386
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:33,880
- It's all over, Rupert!

1387
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:35,480
- Marry me, Ethel!

1388
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:37,120
- I can't marry you, Rupert,

1389
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:39,040
there's so many things
you don't know about me.

1390
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:41,320
- I don't care, I still
want you to marry me.

1391
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:43,240
- Well then take a good look!

1392
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:48,080
- So you're wearing a
wig, big deal, we all are.

1393
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,360
- You don't get it, Rupert!

1394
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:52,840
My name's not Ethel!

1395
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:55,760
It's Frank Guggenheimer, I'm a
man!

1396
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:01,640
(tires screeching)

1397
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:26,760
(ominous music)

1398
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:55,840
- My main man.

1399
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:56,960
What's going down?

1400
01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:58,400
- Step out of the car please.

1401
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:04,800
- Yeah, I'm cool, I'm cool,
brother.

1402
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:07,640
Hey, my man, don't give me
that look, I'm with you, baby.

1403
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:09,040
We gotta fight the man, you
know,

1404
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:10,800
we gotta do the right thing,
you know what I'm saying?

1405
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:12,720
Fight the power!

1406
01:26:12,720 --> 01:26:13,920
Gimme five, gimme!

1407
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:17,440
(tense music)

1408
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:23,040

1409

(kissing)

1410
01:26:55,080 --> 01:26:56,920
- Good work, Mr. Guggenheimer.

1411
01:26:56,920 --> 01:26:58,400
- Thank you, Mr. Ros-top-o-vitz.

1412
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:01,360
- Like Rupert said, we can
only get him on a technicality.

1413
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:03,480
- [Reporter] Hess,
released on a technicality

1414
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:06,240
is suing the LAPD for 165
million.

1415
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:08,240
- [Reporter] The LAPD
claim they've already

1416
01:27:08,240 --> 01:27:10,360
grossed 172 million-

1417
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:12,200
- [Reporter] Jury selection for
the trial

1418
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:14,440

1420
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:01,440
- Wait, wait, I see.

1421
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:24,280
What's with all this fog?

1422
01:28:24,280 --> 01:28:25,840
- It's not fog, it's smog.

1423
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:26,680
We're in L.A.

1424
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:30,160
- I hope this won't be a
problem for Mr. Gesundheim.

1425
01:28:30,160 --> 01:28:32,000
They just left.

1426
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,520
They've only got half an
hour to make their plane.

1427
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,560
Traffic must've been light.

1428
01:29:05,680 --> 01:29:07,280
- Who are you guys?

1429
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:09,160
- Frank.
- Do I know you?

1430
01:29:09,160 --> 01:29:11,680
- Come on, Frank, it's me,
Misty.

1431
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:12,520
- Oh no, it's not.

1432
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:15,240
- Oh yes it is.
- Who the hell are you?

1433
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:16,440
- Gesundheim.

1434
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:18,360
- Thanks, but I didn't sneeze.

1435
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:20,480
- Frank, it really is me, Misty,

1436
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:22,600
or Joanne if you want.

1437
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:24,120
- You sure don't look it.

1438
01:29:24,120 --> 01:29:26,200
- That's because I'm
not undercover anymore.

1439
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:29,400
- You mean-
- Yes, you guessed right.

1440
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:31,160
This is how we look in real
life.

1441
01:29:31,160 --> 01:29:34,000
The faces you used to know,
yes, you guessed right,

1442
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,920
they're disguises the
Bureau designs for us.

1443
01:29:43,480 --> 01:29:45,520
- Well, I guess this is goodbye.

1444
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:47,400
- Maybe we'll meet again, Frank.

1445
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:48,520
- I don't think so.

1446
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:50,440
I'm going to pursue my acting
career.

1447
01:29:50,440 --> 01:29:51,680
- But last night we said-

1448
01:29:51,680 --> 01:29:54,080
- Last night we said a great
deal of foolish things.

1449
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:55,080
You're getting on that plane.

1450
01:29:55,080 --> 01:29:56,440
You go where you belong.

1451
01:29:56,440 --> 01:29:57,920
The problems of three little
people

1452
01:29:57,920 --> 01:29:59,760
won't amount to a hill of
beans in this crazy world.

1453
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:01,920
- You ever get to Washington,
call me.

1454
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:02,800
- Okay, I'll give you a ring.

1455
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:05,040

1459
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:01,680
They couldn't even
afford a decent airline.

1460
01:31:01,680 --> 01:31:03,840

how much can we get for the
