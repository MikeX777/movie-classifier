1
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,560
AngeI...

2
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,640
AngeIica.

3
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:13,120
We have gathered here
to remember someone...

4
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,200
...who touched us, heart and souI.

5
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,800
Living cIose to AngeIica was...

6
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:28,120
It was Iike being on a stormy sea.

7
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,680
The straight and narrow...
didn't suit her.

8
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:39,680
That's not what she wanted.
For her, it was aII or nothing.

9
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,480
When she was angry,
she was furious.

10
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,680
When she was happy,
she was ecstatic.

11
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,920
But when she was sad...
she was heartbroken.

12
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:00,040
DesperateIy inconsoIabIe.

13
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:16,480
Dear Richard, I'm sorry but this
is the only way I can tell you this.

14
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,960
The last thing on earth
I want to do is hurt you.

15
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,760
I can't take this anymore.

16
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,120
You've always wanted us
to live our dream,

17
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,560
but now that dream
has turned into a nightmare.

18
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,480
You are the only
man I have ever loved,

19
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,080
but I can't go on.

20
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:50,680
Forgive me. Yours, Angelica

21
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:04,240
- WiII you stay for dinner?
- No thanks, not today.

22
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,520
PIease? It might cheer AngeIica up.

23
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:14,000
- Is she stiII having a rough time?
- Ever since we started recording...

24
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,360
You're the onIy person
she wants to see.

25
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,920
Christ, Iook at me...!

26
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,440
I Iook terribIe.

27
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,080
Come on...

28
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,680
Too much...

29
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,600
Better.

30
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,400
HeIIo...

31
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,840
AngeIica, Iook who I brought home...

32
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,760
- Like a drink?
- No spirit, though.

33
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,920
A beer won't kiII you, wiII it?

34
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,280
"Dear Richard..."

35
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,720
"The Iast thing
I want to do is hurt you."

36
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,800
"But I...

37
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:14,200
...can't take this anymore."

38
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,840
Oh, my God!

39
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:30,720
We aII beIieved...
that AngeI's zest for Iife

40
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,120
wouId heIp her
overcome any obstacIe.

41
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:39,680
That uItimateIy,
she wouId out-Iive us aII.

42
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,120
But now she's gone.

43
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:52,880
And I don't think I wiII ever
be compIeteIy happy again.

44
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,920
AngeI, you were my angeI.

45
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,680
Go on in...

46
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,640
That was a beautifuI euIogy, Jess.
Not much of a crowd, though.

47
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,640
Lots of peopIe wouId have Iiked
to pay their respects.

48
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,320
Rick didn't want a circus.

49
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,640
- Where were the guys in the band?
- They weren't invited.

50
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,080
I don't Iike them.

51
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,080
I never have.

52
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,360
Thanks.

53
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,960
It was a moving speech.

54
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,200
Times Iike these
show you who your reaI friends are.

55
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,440
- Cheers.
- To AngeI.

56
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,320
To AngeIica.

57
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:41,120
I bet she's Iaughing now, after a
decade with hardIy any record saIes...

58
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,880
What time is it?

59
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,760
- Five to...
- Let's see what they have to say.

60
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,760
A memorial service was held today
for Angelica Holst,

61
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:57,280
better known as Angel, at a chapel
on the outskirts of Stockholm.

62
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:03,200
The service, held three months
after her disappearance...

63
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,360
...attended by
her family and close friends...

64
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:12,440
Angel had chart-topping hits
in the UK and in the US,

65
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:18,760
and she was equally famous
for her wild private life...

66
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,240
StiII aIive and kicking?

67
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,160
Guess what I did today?

68
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:46,200
We had a memoriaI service for you.

69
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,480
- What?
- A memoriaI service.

70
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:56,240
How can you have a service
if there's no body?

71
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,480
- Why didn't you teII me?
- What do you mean?

72
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,440
That sort of thing takes pIanning...
Where was it heId?

73
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,920
- At the chapeI.
- Which one?

74
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,200
- Yours.
- That's going too far, Richard.

75
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,400
My parents are buried there...
Are you out of your mind?

76
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,920
Where eIse?
Of course it had to be that chapeI.

77
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:27,240
Everyone thinks
you're with them.

78
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,840
You shouId have heard Jess...

79
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,680
His speech was so moving, I aImost
thought you were gone for good.

80
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,800
You seem to be enjoying my death.

81
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:42,000
I mean, you're Iaughing.
That's insane!

82
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,200
You've gone too far, Rick.

83
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,880
I spend my days
waiting for you to caII.

84
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,840
And now you teII me
you've buried me!

85
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,440
I'm doing my best. I'm working
my ass off trying to make this work.

86
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,280
Setting the stage for you.

87
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,280
If Jess made a speech,
everyone wiII hate me!

88
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,920
Jess and the others wiII Iaugh.

89
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:12,360
I'm going
to ask everyone over for dinner,

90
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:16,280
and you'II waIk in and we'II party.

91
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:21,400
This isn't funny, Rick.
It's terribIe.

92
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,800
It's cynicaI.
You've gone too far.

93
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,680
I'm doing this for you.

94
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:35,200
When you come back,
you'II see that I was right.

95
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:47,240
What have I done...?

96
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,440
- That was my cue, right?
- Right.

97
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,160
Can I heIp you out in any way?

98
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:21,720
- Is there anything you need?
- No...

99
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,760
Then Iet's try it again.

100
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:30,000
It's so fucking hot in here...
And I've got a coId, too.

101
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,960
- Who Iaid down the guitar track?
- I did.

102
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,080
- I can teII.
- Thanks.

103
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,600
Want me to mute it? WouId it be easier
if you didn't hear it?

104
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:47,560
- WeII, you're the boss...
- Mute the guitar.

105
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,680
What's wrong?

106
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:09,280
- It's so bIoody uninspiring.
- Uninspiring?

107
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,400
- The intro is... wooden.
- It's heavy, that's the whoIe point.

108
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:20,120
Heavy doesn't
have to be Iike a ton of bricks.

109
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:26,120
- Come on, AngeIica.
- Oh, yeah... Christ, this is fun!

110
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:31,120
The cIock's ticking.
Give it aII you've got.

111
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,960
Rick, pIease...
I know when I'm supposed to sing.

112
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,640
- Don't cue me in Iike that.
- I'm onIy...

113
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:02,160
- I'm not a choir girI!
- You're acting Iike one.

114
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,680
ShouId we try another track instead?

115
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:12,760
- I'II go taIk to her.
- Why? Why you?

116
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:16,520
- She's mad at you.
- Then I shouId taIk to her.

117
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:21,200
- Who's married to her?
- You'II just make things worse.

118
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,360
I sent them home.

119
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,360
Good.

120
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:36,240
Do you know what time it is?

121
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,800
It's a bit earIy for wine.

122
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:49,680
So, are we supposed to get drunk,
cIear the air, and start over again.

123
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:59,280
Bring me a gIass
and a bottIe, pIease.

124
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,880
- What's wrong?
- I don't Iike the songs.

125
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:12,120
I'm doing materiaI
that has aIready been done

126
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,600
by better artists than me.

127
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,520
It's a cover aIbum.

128
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,040
Cover...

129
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,920
Don't you get it?

130
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:28,160
Why on earth wouId anyone buy this,

131
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,120
when they don't even
buy my own stuff?

132
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,800
- I wouId.
- You're the onIy one.

133
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:41,640
You Iive in some kind
of a dream worId, Rick.

134
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:46,720
I wish you wouId wake up
and reaIize that it's over.

135
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,480
I'm 40.

136
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,280
I can't write songs anymore.

137
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,240
Nobody buys my records.

138
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,200
And now this desperate move,
cutting an aIbum of covers.

139
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,840
My name tops the "Out" Iist.

140
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,080
A Iist some 1 8-year-oId dreams up.
So who topped the "In" Iist?

141
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,040
AII you do is taIk...
You Iive in this dream worId.

142
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,880
I refuse to make a fooI of myseIf.

143
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:20,040
- Aren't you happy up there?
- Not anymore.

144
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:24,160
- You're on fire...
- Shut up!

145
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,320
What's wrong with you?
I'm not on fire anymore.

146
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,880
I drink wine to get in the mood.

147
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,360
You're stuck in the past.

148
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:39,080
I'm finished.
Accept it, for God's sake...

149
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,400
It's over.

150
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,920
I don't have a Iife.

151
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:49,320
Our reIationship is crap.

152
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,440
Don't touch me!

153
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,640
We don't have kids,
I don't have a famiIy...

154
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:03,720
Christ, I'd be better off dead.

155
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,880
I'm going to the studio.

156
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,680
I guess you won't be coming in...

157
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:18,360
AII right, then I'II do some mixing.

158
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:22,240
Listen, AngeIica...

159
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,320
I've been up aII night
thinking about what you said.

160
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,840
You're right.

161
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,200
- About being washed up?
- No...

162
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,160
About being better off dead.

163
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:41,360
Not for reaI.
PeopIe shouId think you're dead.

164
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,440
What happened when PresIey died?

165
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:50,080
Kurt Cobain, Hendrix, Janis JopIin,
Eva Cassidy, Nick Drake...

166
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,200
...that T. Rex guy, Marc BoIan...

167
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:59,640
They became bigger than ever.
The media caIIs them geniuses.

168
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:06,040
CountIess coIIections are reIeased...

00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,040
"The EssentiaI AngeI"

170
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,840
"AngeI, The Tracks From Heaven"

171
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,960
There's a heII of a difference
between me and EIvis.

172
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,600
ExactIy, you can come back.

173
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:31,240
OnIy one guy's ever puIIed that off:
Jesus Christ.

174
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:35,600
Rick...

175
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:42,000
- Are you serious?
- It's a briIIiant idea.

176
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,680
It's insane...

177
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,400
How wouId we do it?

178
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,960
We have to finish the aIbum first.

179
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,320
Then we have to kiII you.
PeopIe have to beIieve you're dead.

180
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,640
You'II have to disappear
for six months.

181
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,800
Or three or four...

182
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:08,880
UntiI the wheeIs are set in motion
and the aIbum's been reIeased.

183
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:12,960
How shouId I die?

184
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:18,240
No one wouId be surprised if you
got drunk and jumped into the sea.

185
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:26,200
- I haven't been drunk in ages.
- But it gave us headIines.

186
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,520
What did they caII you?
"The doIphin"...

187
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,800
Stop it!

188
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:39,000
Suicide, it's the best way to go.

189
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,960
It's unbeatabIe.

190
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,200
If you kiII yourseIf, you're back.

191
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:51,400
A mystery for the press:
"Why did AngeI kiII herseIf?"

192
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:55,840
"AngeI's death wish"

193
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,040
"Missing AngeI"

194
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,960
You can't Iie Iike that.

195
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,840
Sure you can.

196
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,960
It's bIoody effective.

197
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,000
Take CIinton, for instance...

198
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,120
"I did not have sex with that woman."

199
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:24,600
Three months Iater, it was: "Sorry".
And no one gave a damn.

200
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:29,280
Keith Richard:
"I snorted my father's ashes."

201
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:35,160
Two weeks Iater: "I was onIy joking."
Perfect timing for the worId tour.

202
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:41,120
Who cares about the truth?
The truth is boring.

203
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,960
PeopIe Iove a good story.

204
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,480
And that's what this is.

205
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,720
"AngeI commits suicide", good story.

206
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,800
"AngeI comes back", even better.

207
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:00,240
The press seII papers,
peopIe get the gossip they Iove,

208
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:06,200
the record company seIIs records,
and AngeI fIies again.

209
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:09,200
And I fIy with with you.

210
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:14,920
What if I want to fIy soIo.

211
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:20,440
What happens if you crash?

212
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,200
When are the guys
coming in to the studio?

213
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:45,280
- I canceIIed.
- TeII them it's on again.

214
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,320
- Peking. Shanghai.
- No.

215
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:15,200
Tokyo, Singapore, Bangkok?

216
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,120
- What other cities are there in Asia?
- There are miIIions.

217
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:23,720
And I've never had a gig in Asia.

218
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:29,200
- You've never had a gig in Asia.
- No...

219
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,600
That's what makes it so perfect.

220
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,920
Why wasn't I ever a hit in Japan?

221
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:39,120
Meja, a Swedish bIonde,
has soId ziIIions of records.

222
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,800
- But I've soId zip...
- Forget about Meja, and the past.

223
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,640
Focus on the future.

224
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:51,200
Asia is perfect.
No one wiII recognise you.

225
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,600
Aren't you coming in?

226
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:32,200
- Don't teII me this isn't paradise.
- This is paradise.

227
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,640
It's perfect.
There's nobody around.

228
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,600
- Just imagine the off season.
- This is the off season.

229
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,800
It wiII be even more off season
by the time you return.

230
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,320
AII aIone. For three whoIe months.

231
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,440
Write a song, about me for once.

232
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,920
Hi, Eva.

233
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:01,680
- How are things?
- Crap.

234
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,080
This pIace sucks.
The Caribbean is better.

235
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:11,720
- So, how's our JeIIy hoIding up?
- She won't Ieave the room.

236
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,560
AII she does is Iie in bed
watching Thai TV.

237
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,920
- How do you cope with her?
- Maybe you shouId just come home?

238
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:27,520
- I can't rebook our tickets.
- Give her my Iove...

239
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:33,000
- And take good care of her.
- I wiII. Catch you Iater.

240
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,600
A penny for your thoughts.

241
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,560
Have we forgotten anything?

242
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:17,880
We've gone over everything.
I Iike this pIace.

243
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,920
I'II spend my days
with yoga, swimming, reading...

244
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,000
I can do this for three months.

245
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:32,120
- Don't caII me, I'II caII you.
- Does it reaIIy matter?

246
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:35,920
It's important that onIy
the two of us know.

247
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:42,480
Everyone eIse wiII think you're dead,
and dead peopIe don't taIk.

248
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,200
Pamper yourseIf.

249
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,880
Yoga, fruit juice...
Keep away from anything eIse.

250
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:55,120
- I've been sober for seven years now.
- And don't read the papers.

251
00:27:55,280 --> 00:28:00,840
Once we set this in motion,
we won't be abIe to stop it.

252
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,040
- There wiII be a Iot of taIk.
- WeII, isn't that the point?

253
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,520
- Is there anybody I don't know about?
- What do you mean?

254
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,640
I don't want to hear:

255
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:27,280
"I had sex with AngeI
in a Iift in BerIin."

256
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,120
I did have sex in a Iift in BerIin...

257
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:35,560
But that was before I met you.

258
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,200
It's you and me.

259
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:42,440
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

260
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:46,400
Dear Richard...

261
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:53,760
I'm sorry, but this is
the onIy way I can teII you this.

262
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:01,720
The Iast thing on earth
I want to do is hurt you.

263
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:06,080
But I can't go on.

264
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,400
You've always wanted us
to live our dream,

265
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:14,000
but now that dream
has turned into a nightmare.

266
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:19,280
You are the onIy
man I have ever Ioved,

267
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,640
but I can't go on.

268
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:28,680
"Forgive me. Yours, AngeIica."
- My God!

269
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:37,320
- Am I good, or am I good?
- Okay. Just one thing...

270
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:41,880
How can you be so sure that you're
the onIy man I ever Ioved?

271
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,480
Because you just wrote it down.

272
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,680
- So?
- It was okay...

273
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:54,400
- It's great.
- It's good.

274
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,760
There's one Iast thing we need to do:

275
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:03,800
- Stage a scandaI.
- Like, go out with someone eIse?

276
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:08,120
That's not a scandaI,
that's what everyone wants.

277
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:14,480
I've booked an interview
tomorrow, with Frank.

278
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:20,080
You want Frank to interview me?

279
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,560
No, I want you to puke on him.

280
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:28,240
Or punch him. Do whatever you want,
as Iong as we make the front page.

281
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,920
Your new record, what's it Iike?

282
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,880
AbsoIuteIy fabuIous.

283
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:40,520
- What's the materiaI Iike?
- DyIan crap.

284
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,840
The kind of crap you Iike.
- Isn't that right, Rick?

285
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,200
My new record is fuII of shit.

286
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:53,680
I don't mean that DyIan is crap,
and I'm not doing any DyIan songs,

287
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:57,400
but there's a bunch
of shitty songs I can't sing.

288
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:02,600
- A piIe of shit, that's what it is.
- It's rubbish.

289
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:07,840
- What kind of fucking interview...
- Take it easy, AngeIica.

290
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,080
He's supposed to be interviewing me,
for fuck's sake!

291
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,880
Leave me aIone!

292
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:24,800
What the heII are you Iooking at?

293
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,000
Let go of me! Fuck you!

294
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:34,960
- Where's my bag, Eva?!
- I want you out of here!

295
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:39,200
- Let go!
- PuII yourseIf together.

296
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:43,360
PIease, I'd Iike to pay the biII.
I'm so sorry about...

297
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:46,360
She's obviousIy unbaIanced.

298
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:49,560
PuII yourseIf together!

299
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:54,640
- What the heII...!
- CouId you caII us a taxi?

300
00:31:54,800 --> 00:32:00,640
- There was a photographer in there.
- Great, that'II make the headIines.

301
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:09,480
- I can't board in StockhoIm.
- No, you'II board in Frankfurt.

302
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:12,560
Frankfurt? Why Frankfurt?

303
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,720
Because it's
the messiest airport in Europe.

304
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,960
How do I get there?

305
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:23,840
Hitchhike? By train?

306
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,080
- When?
- Not yet...

307
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,840
- Don't Iook.
- Why not?

308
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,480
- Don't Iook!
- I've got to keep my eye on the road.

309
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,800
That's smart...

310
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,080
Stop it!

311
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:04,200
I'm the one doing this, you know.
It's for reaI.

312
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:11,000
If someone recognises me on the train
they'II caII the papers...

313
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:16,920
WeII, if you're going
to wear that stupid wig,

314
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:20,200
what do you expect?

315
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,560
Show it to me again.

316
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,440
Christ, Iook at me!

317
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,200
I Iook terribIe.

318
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:34,000
A train from StockhoIm to MaImA¶.

319
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,920
Then on to Copenhagen,
Hamburg and Frankfurt.

320
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,800
Buy your pIane ticket there, pay cash.

321
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:43,080
FIy Thai Air, not SAS.

322
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:47,480
- Use the name AngeIica Horst.
- Horst?

323
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:51,760
OnIy one Ietter is different,
and no one can trace you.

324
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:56,800
For the Iast time,
where do you put the note?

325
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,240
On the piano.

326
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,800
And then?

327
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:08,240
I go to the shore,
making sure I Ieave footprints.

328
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,800
Then I swim over to the Iadder...

329
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,200
I don't know why I have to swim,
the footprints shouId be enough...

330
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:20,520
- Then you take the train to...
- Copenhagen. Then Frankfurt.

331
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:27,120
- And what name do you use?
- Horst. AngeIica Horst.

332
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,920
Look at me...

333
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:42,680
The most important thing:
Don't caII me, I'II caII you.

334
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:56,280
Don't shake it!

335
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:09,240
A gentIeman.

336
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:17,520
- WiII you miss me?
- I aIready do.

337
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:22,880
Give my regards
to EIvis, John Lennon, Hendrix.

338
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:27,240
Give Janis a hug from me.

339
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:00,640
Life with AngeIica meant...

340
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,880
...a Iot of ups and downs.

341
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,720
LateIy, mostIy downs.

342
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,960
We were wrapping up
her Iatest aIbum,

343
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:15,240
and we were hoping
it wouId be a come-back...

344
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,400
And...

345
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,320
You see, she...
We had to canceI a day in the studio,

346
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:38,520
and then there's been
aII that bad press...

347
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:46,760
"AngeI's recording and who cares."
And she topped the "Out" Iist...

348
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:51,080
- The "Out" Iist?
- Like in the papers.

349
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:55,120
It was a bIow.

350
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:01,840
And she actuaIIy said...
that she might as weII be dead.

351
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,640
She's had unstabIe periods...

352
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:11,120
It's not the first time
she's threatened to commit suicide.

353
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,080
It isn't...

354
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,720
CouId you teII me
exactIy what happened?

355
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,400
Jess and I waIked in. We...

356
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,600
He went down to the shore
and I grabbed two beers.

357
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,520
We caIIed her mobiIe and we heard
the phone down by the water.

358
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,080
I've aIready toId you aII this.

359
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:35,400
What do you think has happened?

360
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:01,920
For God's sake, Rick...

361
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:06,000
Don't expect a worst-case scenario.

362
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:12,360
She'II turn up, she's probabIy just
gone away somewhere for a whiIe.

363
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,720
If you promise...

364
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:25,280
...to cover this
in a fair and baIanced way...

365
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:31,440
...I'II give you
the first shot at the information.

366
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,080
If they find her in the water,

367
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:39,760
or if she comes back,
you'II be the first to know.

368
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:45,200
- How have things been between you?
- Good...

369
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:48,640
I saw her during that interview.

370
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:53,440
WeII... we have our ups and downs.

371
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:01,360
Think it has anything to do with that?

372
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:06,280
- With the two of you?
- Us?

373
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:09,680
What do you mean,
that I did something to her?

374
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:18,720
- Isn't that so?
- That's why I'm here, Frank.

375
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:24,200
You've aIways been straight with me.

376
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:31,200
I need someone
to cover this in a fair way.

377
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:38,400
You know that I'II try to be baIanced,
and that you can trust me.

378
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,960
"Trust me"...

379
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,960
HeIIo, darIing...

380
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:51,160
I onIy caII when I'm aIone.
What's the weather Iike?

381
00:43:55,280 --> 00:44:00,000
- Have you been drinking?
- No, I haven't...

382
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:06,040
Listen, have they found my body yet?

383
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:12,400
What? No, I just keep
hearing a Iot of static.

384
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,040
Static...

385
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:19,280
What I'm doing?
I... I don't want to be here anymore.

386
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:23,640
Don't want to...

387
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:27,720
I don't want to be here.

388
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:29,680
I don't...

389
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:34,080
You can't come home right now.

390
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:39,480
No, you can't.

391
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:42,560
We have to stick to the pIan.

392
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,720
PIease Rick, Iet me come home...

393
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,960
It won't be
for much Ionger, sweetheart.

394
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:57,360
It wiII be fine. What about your yoga?
The aIbum's gone pIatinum.

395
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:01,240
You've been drinking, I can teII.

396
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,640
Oh, my God!

397
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:30,600
We shouId have said no.

398
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:34,000
- He'II make you cry.
- Then I'II cry.

399
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:38,680
And if you don't, you'II come across
Iike a coId bastard.

400
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:42,600
- I shouId have stopped this.
- Why didn't you?

401
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:46,760
Because... you accepted
without discussing it with me first.

402
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:51,840
I mean, what was he a year ago?
A hockey reporter...

403
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,720
It's a new situation for him, too.

404
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:59,360
- How much have you had to drink?
- Your job is to be supportive.

405
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,920
Not to be some kind of mother.

406
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:05,440
It's nice to have you here, Richard.

407
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:10,760
CouId you teII me, and our viewers,
what's on your mind right now?

408
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,800
How wouId you
express your thoughts?

409
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:19,200
For starters, I feeI
a bit nervous about being here.

410
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:25,560
I reaIise that you'II
be wanting to discuss...

411
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:28,760
...certain events that I,
for the past month,

412
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:33,960
have tried to understand.

413
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:52,080
It might sound strange, but to me,
she isn't dead. She can't be dead.

414
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:56,360
- CouId you eIaborate on that?
- WeII, I...

415
00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:02,320
I won't give up
untiI they find... her.

416
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:09,240
As Iong as she hasn't been found...
I won't Iet go.

417
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:13,600
What did you say
at the memoriaI service?

418
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,320
Nothing.

419
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:20,120
It's an absurd situation...

420
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:27,040
Having a memoriaI service
for someone who's missing...

421
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:34,280
...whiIe stiII...
WeII, not knowing the whoIe story.

422
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:40,760
If we go back to the day
she went missing, what did you think?

423
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:44,560
My first thought
was that she had Ieft me.

424
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:48,440
Then we found the note...

425
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:56,280
And it opened the door
to dark thoughts...

426
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:00,360
That something even worse
might have happened.

427
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:09,280
- How did that make you feeI?
- Terrified, speechIess...

428
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:13,960
Like anyone eIse
confronted with a crisis Iike that.

429
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:21,960
There I was, in the house we shared,
and she was gone...

430
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:26,200
It was so unreaI.

431
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:30,560
What was her state of mind
before this happened?

432
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:36,600
Living with an artist,
a performer Iike AngeI...

433
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:42,160
You Iive with the artist, but you aIso
Iive with the woman, AngeIica.

434
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:45,360
AngeIica was preparing
for AngeI's come-back.

435
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:50,080
And that process was rough on her...

436
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:55,040
She doubted herseIf...

437
00:49:55,200 --> 00:50:01,320
And it makes me angry and sad
that she is isn't here today to see...

438
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:06,440
...that aII her agonizing,
that she wasn't good enough,

439
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:09,920
that she was a has-been...

440
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:15,880
And when the record was reIeased
that wasn't the case at aII.

441
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:18,360
It pisses me off
that she missed that.

442
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:24,120
If AngeI couId see you,
up there in heaven...

443
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:28,160
If she couId hear
what we said here tonight.

444
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:32,720
What wouId you say to her?

445
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:38,440
Come home.

446
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:41,800
WeII done.

447
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:47,920
- Thank you for being there.
- LoveIy wine...

448
00:50:56,360 --> 00:51:00,400
It was great the way
you came to her defence Iike that.

449
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:05,640
She wouId have been so... pIeased.

450
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,520
What?

451
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:23,280
Then why
did you come back here with me?

452
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:43,320
It's just a journaIist.
Say I'm not here.

453
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:57,000
- I know I'm not supposed to caII...
- Who is it?

454
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:00,400
HeIIo?

455
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:03,840
Shit, shit, shit...

456
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:17,440
What's the matter?

457
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:29,920
What the heII is wrong?

458
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:32,200
AngeIica...

459
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:34,920
AngeIica?

460
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:40,520
For God's sake, Eva... Some freak
saw the show and caIIed.

461
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:42,840
Dead peopIe don't taIk...

462
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
You knew, you bastard!

463
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:58,920
Didn't we agree
that you weren't supposed to caII?

464
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:02,160
- Did she recognise my voice?
- Yes.

465
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:05,200
- What did she say?
- What do you think?

466
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:09,160
- I'd better taIk to her...
- No!

467
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:13,640
I toId her it wasn't you.

468
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:16,880
I think she beIieved me.

469
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:20,400
I'm pretty sure she beIieved me.

470
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:23,920
HeIIo? AngeIica?

471
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:30,280
- What's wrong?
- I can't do this.

472
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:34,320
- I can't take this anymore.
- Sweetheart...

473
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:39,360
I reaIIy need to come home.

474
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:42,520
- What?
- I need to come home.

475
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:47,400
You can't come home,
everybody thinks you're dead.

476
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:49,840
I wiII be dead soon.

477
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:55,040
You and I wiII have to figure out
when you can come back to Iife.

478
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:59,800
- It can't...
- Why didn't you caII today?

479
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:04,760
- I was on Jihde.
- What's that?

480
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:09,320
- He's that hockey reporter...
- Hockey?

481
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:12,800
He has a taIk show now.

482
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:17,080
- You were on a hockey show?
- No, he has a taIk show now.

483
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:23,360
I toId the whoIe country
how much I Iove you, and miss you.

484
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:27,520
- TeII me.
- I miss you so damn much.

485
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:31,520
I don't want to be here anymore.
I want to go home.

486
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:36,600
That's not possibIe. Listen,
sweetheart, I'II come to you.

487
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:40,240
- ThaiIand's not exactIy next door.
- I know...

488
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:44,480
It takes ten hours to get there.

489
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:47,240
I'II be there tomorrow, I promise.

490
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:52,600
I'II tie up some Ioose ends here and
then we'II spend a few days together.

491
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:57,960
We'II put our heads together, then
we'II go home and face the bastards.

492
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,880
HeIIo... What are you doing here?

493
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:14,000
I've been trying
to get hoId of you, Eva...

494
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:18,720
About yesterday, I'm so sorry.
Can we taIk?

495
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:22,880
- Eva, pIease...
- Don't touch me, you bastard!

496
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:27,080
Let's caIm down and discuss this.

497
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:29,960
AII right?

498
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,720
We had to do this.

499
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:41,120
The whoIe pIan hinged on one thing,
that onIy the two of us knew.

500
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:44,640
Come on, AngeI's success
has paid your saIary...

501
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:48,480
You sick bastard! Damn you!

502
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:54,640
AII those years I fucking wasted
on the bIoody pair of you!

503
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:01,160
It's your word against mine.

504
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:08,600
- Rick?
- Yeah...

505
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:16,440
- Where are you?
- Over here.

506
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:23,720
How are you?

507
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:26,280
So-so...

508
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:32,200
Have a seat.

509
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:38,000
I'm not sure how to say this...

510
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:44,280
But I wanted you
to be the first to know.

511
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:51,200
Brace yourseIf...

512
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:54,360
She's aIive.

513
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:58,920
AngeIica's aIive.

514
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:08,160
You know what things were Iike
right before she disappeared...

515
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:15,400
I guess she bIacked-out, or something.
She went off to spend time aIone...

516
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:23,200
And now she wants to come home.

517
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:30,080
You can imagine
what a ruckus there wiII be.

518
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:33,920
The press wiII go bananas.

519
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:41,040
Sam wiII be on my case. I mean,
the aIbum's soId muIti-pIatinum...

520
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:46,480
He's going to push us
to go on tour...

521
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:51,000
- You are such a bastard.
- What do you mean?

522
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:54,640
AngeIica caIIed me yesterday.

523
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:57,680
Her version is different.

524
00:59:57,840 --> 01:00:00,600
Hang on...

525
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:05,560
This isn't what you think...

526
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:10,800
Look, we need each other right now.
Listen to me...

527
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:16,160
"Times Iike these show you who
your reaI friends are", remember that?

528
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:22,800
And now you can prove to me
that you are a reaI friend.

529
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:26,320
You know what it's been Iike.

530
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:29,080
I mean, was it good?

531
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:32,400
We're aII affected
when things don't go weII for AngeI.

532
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:36,960
This was a way to turn things around.
And you must admit that it worked.

533
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:44,400
Now this is phase two:
invoIving you and the whoIe band.

534
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:47,720
We're on a roII! I promise you...

535
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:52,360
I know I Iied,
that I acted Iike a bastard,

536
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:55,240
but the pIan was

537
01:00:55,400 --> 01:01:00,280
that you, me, Sam and Eva
were going to have dinner together,

538
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:06,040
and she wouId waIk in...
And we wouId Iaugh our heads off.

539
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:13,280
We'd knock back a few drinks
and then start rehearsing.

540
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:17,880
Back on the track, back on the bIock,
for Christ's sake.

541
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:22,360
Come on, it's rock'n'roII!

542
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:27,080
Feed the press a good story,
they'II eat it up.

543
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:32,160
This isn't about the press,
or about what spin you can put on it,

544
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:37,200
this is about human beings,
about a girI who's an oId friend...

545
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:41,440
It's about her Iife.

546
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:46,400
Do you think
I wouId Iet AngeIica down?

547
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:54,680
Even if this went straight to heII,
I wouId foIIow her there.

548
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:02,800
Who cares about the Iies?

549
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:06,080
It's just a Ioad of... Who cares?

550
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:08,760
You know I'm sincere.

551
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:15,640
Can you Iook me in the eye and say
you don't want to tour with us?

552
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:24,800
I wouId Iove to do it... for AngeIica.

553
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:27,200
Not for you?

554
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:29,720
DefiniteIy not for you.

555
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:33,600
WeII, canceI it.
No, I can't say it over the phone.

556
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:37,680
I have a fIight to catch at 2:30.

557
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:41,520
I'II be Ieaving an hour from now.

558
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:46,080
Sam, I don't have time for this,
it's now or never.

559
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:49,320
Get in your car
and drive on over here.

560
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:54,360
Be here in 30 minutes,
or you'II Iive to regret it.

561
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:58,600
Fucking Ioser.

562
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:09,560
- Rick?
- Yeah.

563
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:15,920
Rick... You can't expect me to drop
everything and come running.

564
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:20,920
I have a Iife. I spend my days on the
phone, for your benefit, by the way.

565
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:25,920
AIbum saIes are rocketing, but
the company wants more materiaI.

566
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:33,000
And aII I can say is: "Sorry, dead
artists don't record new materiaI."

567
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:38,480
- UnIess they come back.
- Right, but they don't.

568
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:42,040
She's aIive.

569
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:45,640
- What?
- AngeI's aIive.

570
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:51,520
- How do you know that?
- I've known it the whoIe time.

571
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:57,160
We decided to kiII her
to get the baII roIIing again.

572
01:03:57,320 --> 01:04:01,320
Suicide - the papers eat it up.

573
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:05,880
We aIways pIanned to bring her back.

574
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:10,240
How the heII couId you say
those things on prime time teIevision?

575
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:14,640
For God's sake, Sam,
don't be so Swedish.

576
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:18,160
It worked. It's rock'n'roII.

577
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:21,000
As of now, you shouIder the costs.

578
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:25,840
We'II take 70 % of the profits
and you'II get 30 %.

579
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:34,040
I guess I ought to say
you're a genius...

580
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:39,800
- Go ahead, say it.
- Okay, you're a genius.

581
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:45,440
By the way,
not a word untiI we get back.

582
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:48,240
I'II be Ianding in Bangkok tomorrow,
at 6:30 am.

583
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:54,520
So I'II be in PimaIai with AngeIica
around Iunchtime.

584
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:59,680
I have no idea,
that depends on how she's doing.

585
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:05,280
We haven't seen each other
for three months, we need to taIk.

586
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:10,160
Listen, Sam, if you're bringing
someone back from the dead,

587
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:16,120
you don't fart around,
you drop a bomb.

588
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:24,440
Let me take care of the resurrection,
you can prepare the discipIes.

589
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:29,560
By the way, don't discuss any of this
with Eva untiI I get back.

590
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:32,160
Keep her out of this.

591
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:37,680
Because I have things to say to her.
Good...

592
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:45,400
Just do as I say and we can retire
in comfort. Love ya'.

593
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:04,840
She's aIive. AngeIica isn't dead.

594
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,520
- Hang on...
- I taIked to her.

595
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:12,840
- Where is she?
- In ThaiIand.

596
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,480
And Rick? Doesn't he know?

597
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:17,760
He knows everything.

598
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:21,160
They pIanned it together.

599
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:26,640
What are you doing?
Rick's on a fIight to ThaiIand.

600
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:32,960
He'II be Ianding
around midnight, our time.

601
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:39,680
Do you reaIise how big this is?

602
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:43,760
God, I've missed you!

603
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:49,120
It's been so Iong I've forgotten
what it's Iike. AImost...

604
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:03,640
I missed you.

605
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:06,720
Every singIe second.

606
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:15,120
- Who knows that I'm stiII aIive?
- Sam.

607
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:19,400
And who wouId he teII?
Lots of peopIe, I bet.

608
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:22,800
He promised not to teII.

609
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:29,240
- Can you trust him?
- WeII, we'II see.

610
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:33,240
I had to teII him.
Like you had to teII Jess.

611
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:38,120
I had to teII Jess
since Eva knew about it.

612
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:42,720
- He's pissed off.
- But not at me.

613
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:46,800
I'm a bastard.

614
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:51,040
- So you caIIed Eva?
- Yes, but she won't taIk to me.

615
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:56,680
What a fucking mess... We'II
straighten it out when we get back.

616
01:08:56,840 --> 01:09:00,560
You can't pIay with death.

617
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:03,680
Sure you can.

618
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:06,520
I went to a reaI funeraI.

619
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:08,800
With reaI peopIe.

620
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:12,680
With a reaI dead body.

621
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:18,440
A reaI chiId who Iost her father.
And a woman who Iost her husband.

622
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:23,560
- Death is no joke.
- That's different.

623
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:26,960
We're pIaying the game.

624
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:31,240
We're in controI,
and as Iong as we are,

625
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:34,520
there won't be a probIem.

626
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:37,480
AII I want right now...

627
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:41,200
...is to go home, with you.
In peace and quiet.

628
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:08,360
- Angel is back.
- No one knows why...

629
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:12,360
Jesus returned
"covered in glory".

630
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:17,280
Angel returns covered in a sarong,
with paparazzi up her ass.

631
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:09,000
Fucking idiots...

632
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:15,440
Isn't that nice,
you stiII have the boat.

633
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:36,000
You couId at Ieast
have done the fucking dishes!

634
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:38,840
I was in a hurry to get to you.

635
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,880
It took you two days to get there.

636
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:46,080
You couId have done
the fucking dishes!

637
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:51,800
And why is that damn boat stiII here?
"I soId the boat, darIing"...

638
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:56,480
The heII you did!
You never stop Iying, why is that?!

639
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:59,200
AII you do is Iie!!

640
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:02,760
We don't have to seII the boat now.

641
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:05,960
I hate that fucking boat.

642
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:09,240
Then we'II seII it. It's cooI...

643
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,840
Come on...

644
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:18,000
It's ugIy, it's huge...

645
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:22,760
- Like me.
- Knock it off!

646
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:26,920
CouId we start over?

647
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:31,000
WeIcome home.

648
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:39,000
CouId we try to keep our heads here?

649
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:43,280
It's gone better than we expected.

650
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:46,880
TaIk about a weIcome committee...

651
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:51,560
What other Swedish artist
couId have generated that?

652
01:12:55,480 --> 01:13:00,040
You can keep your sense of humour,
you know.

653
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:08,640
Why don't we have kids?

654
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:12,920
- You never wanted any.
- No, that was you.

655
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:18,120
It didn't fit in
with my image, did it?

656
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:21,720
Have I ever said that?

657
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:24,880
That it didn't fit in with your image?

658
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:27,280
Not in so many words, but...

659
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:31,480
How the heII can you... PIease.

660
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:36,240
"Don't take out that coiI,
now's not a good time."

661
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:41,440
- "It wouIdn't suit your image."
- Did I say that?

662
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:45,200
Did I actuaIIy say that?

663
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:49,440
No, you didn't.

664
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:52,680
I did.

665
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:07,000
You know, you can touch a cheek
Iike this, too...

666
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:11,120
What's with that portrait of me?

667
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:15,960
- We used it in church.
- What?

668
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:19,840
The memoriaI service.

669
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:24,640
You used that picture of me
for the memoriaI service?

670
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:28,720
- I can't stand it.
- ReaIIy?

671
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:32,960
What the...?

672
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:36,720
You know that I hate it.

673
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:41,480
Why did you have that service?
You didn't discuss it with me.

674
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:47,560
Eva is hurt. I've caIIed her a miIIion
times, but she won't take my caIIs.

675
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:53,280
She's devastated.
She's one of my best friends.

676
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:56,280
And how do you think Jess...

677
01:14:56,440 --> 01:15:00,320
"Jess", that's pIain siIIy,
his name is Jesper AstIund!

678
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:04,360
You're Richard,
and "Sam" is SamueI.

679
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:10,000
It's aII
Iike some fucking stupid game!

680
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:15,440
You aII waIk around in sungIasses,
Iooking Iike fucking insects!

681
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:19,560
- Damn you.
- For God's sake...

682
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:23,080
Damn you! DAMN YOU ALL!

683
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:30,240
- Why is everything my fauIt?
- You are so fucking greedy!

684
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:33,880
You stiII have that fucking boat!

685
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:37,400
- Listen to me!
- Don't you hit me!

686
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:41,200
- There are reporters out there.
- Listen to me!

687
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:45,800
I'II go out
and teII them you hit me.

688
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:50,800
Then you'II get your headIines,
and that's aII you care about!

689
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:56,280
- "AngeI abused"
- What a great headIine.

690
01:15:56,440 --> 01:16:00,440
- It's fabuIous.
- Listen to me.

691
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:07,240
I'm aIways wrong! I'm greedy.
I do this, that, and the other...

692
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:14,320
But have I ever done anything
that wasn't for you?

693
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:17,640
The boat, maybe.
So seII it or sink it!

694
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:21,400
- What about that motorcycIe?
- It's Ieased.

695
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:24,920
I don't own it, I Iease it.

696
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:29,600
Yes, there was a memoriaI service.

697
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:32,760
It was nothing I pIanned in advance,

698
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:37,160
but peopIe wanted to have
a ceremony in your honour.

699
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:40,920
Your friends.
So what was so wrong about that?

700
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:45,880
- Who was there?
- The peopIe cIosest to us...

701
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:51,600
- Aunt EIIen, was she there?
- Aunt EIIen?

702
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:56,320
- No.
- Why wasn't Aunt EIIen there?

703
01:16:56,480 --> 01:17:01,320
- Why wasn't she there?
- I forgot about her...

704
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:10,040
- She's the onIy reIative I have Ieft!
- I... forgot about her.

705
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:14,440
- What about the band?
- They weren't there. OnIy Jess.

706
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:20,960
- Not those other asshoIes.
- They're my coIIeagues.

707
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:24,920
I onIy wanted
our reaI friends to be there.

708
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:30,360
They are my friends. My reaI friends.
And they weren't invited.

709
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:33,240
So who was? Every journaIist in town?

710
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:36,160
Jess was there, but no journaIists.

711
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:39,200
I'II do this tour.

712
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:41,440
For your sake.

713
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:46,880
If I don't, you'II Iook Iike a fooI.

714
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:44,160
- How did you manage to get in?
- The pIace is under siege.

715
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:48,880
'After three months, she rose again.'

716
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:52,080
Amazing.

717
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:55,400
I'm so, so sorry...

718
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:02,200
Did you Iook Iike this at the funeraI?

719
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:07,160
- CooI, even at a funeraI.
- Anything for you.

720
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:13,120
And at breakfast he goes:
"I want you to wear wings."

721
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:19,120
Then he puIIs out those bIack wings
I wore back in... 1 992.

722
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:22,960
Whose idea was it to wear wings?

723
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:29,240
- Sam and I taIked about it...
- Isn't that just Iike Sam...

724
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:34,760
I'm going to make a big enough fooI
of myseIf without wings.

725
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:37,040
You don't have to wear them.

726
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:40,920
You're onIy saying that
because Jess is here.

727
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:43,280
See how she treats me?

728
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:49,280
- Who is it?
- No one. I'm going to the bathroom.

729
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:55,040
- You can wear the wings.
- I fIy high enough without them.

730
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:08,120
Eva?

731
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:12,680
HeIIo, AngeIica.

732
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:17,480
Why are you hiding?

733
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:22,080
HeIIo. It's been a whiIe.

734
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:24,720
It has.

735
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:28,240
- How are things going?
- Fine...

736
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:32,880
Why haven't you
been taking my caIIs?

737
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:39,520
- I need you, Eva.
- So now you need me... Right.

738
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:44,600
- Why?
- If you took my caIIs, you'd know.

739
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:50,280
How couId you do this to me? To me?!

740
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:55,960
AII my Iife I have heIped you,

741
01:20:56,120 --> 01:21:00,320
and taken care of aII your shit!

742
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:03,800
As for that bastard Rick...

743
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:09,040
How the heII can you trust him,
and not me?

744
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:17,320
Do you know what he did?
That wonderfuI husband of yours...

745
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:22,040
Know what he did when you
were pIaying dead in ThaiIand?

746
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:27,080
In your expensive air chair?

747
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:32,720
AII right, Janne.
I just needed to get some air.

748
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:36,360
I'm coming...
I'II be there when I get there!

749
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:39,160
BIoody idiot...

750
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:45,200
He fucked you.

751
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:52,040
- And that's okay with you?
- I've aIways sensed this rivaIry.

752
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:56,160
OnIy I never reaIIy knew
what it was aII about.

753
01:21:56,320 --> 01:22:00,680
It's you, Eva... you've been
in Iove with him the whoIe time.

754
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:07,760
DarIing, I can't trust anyone anymore.

755
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:13,360
If you had bothered to try,
you couId have trusted me.

756
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:16,640
I am aII aIone,
do you understand that?

757
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:23,160
I wiII aIways be aIone. I'm the one
who has to go through with this.

758
01:22:23,320 --> 01:22:27,320
Or we'II aII be dead for reaI.

759
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:31,040
How couId you do it?

760
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:34,720
How the heII
couId you do such a thing?

761
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:41,200
Don't you see?
You ruined everything, you sick cow!

762
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:44,240
I have taken care of you
my whoIe Iife.

763
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:48,080
Ever since we were kids!

764
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:52,320
And aII you ever do is shit on me!

765
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:56,960
You reduced me to nothing.

766
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:59,720
I don't even exist anymore!

767
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:05,640
- I have apoIogised to you...
- How do you think I feIt?

768
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:09,520
First you go and kiII yourseIf
without taIking to me.

769
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:14,600
Then suddenIy it's aII a joke, and
you're in ThaiIand, getting pissed!

770
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:18,520
How fucking sick can a person be?

771
01:23:18,680 --> 01:23:21,000
You're nothing!

772
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:24,320
You can't even sing!

773
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:29,840
- Without me, you're nothing!
- That's what everybody says.

774
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:33,200
They aII say:
Without me, you wouId be nothing.

775
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:36,880
Everybody
in the whoIe damn worId says that.

776
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:39,200
I accept that.

777
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:42,960
I am nothing on my own.
I know I can't sing.

778
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:47,960
I'm not stupid enough to think
I'm Liza MinneIIi.

779
01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:53,800
I'm Iousy. I'm useIess.

780
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:58,440
But I'm front-page news,
so the show must go on, darIing.

781
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:28,960
- Eva was here.
- Eva?

782
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:32,160
Eva was here?

783
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:38,360
What did she say?

784
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:43,080
That I can't trust anyone.

785
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:50,280
There's no one I can trust.

786
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:03,240
Listen...

787
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:06,320
She toId me that you...

788
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:16,080
Rick?

789
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:36,680
Are you pIanning
to sit out here aII night?

790
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:40,400
I figured you wanted to be aIone.

791
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:45,680
I had nightmares,
and I can't go back to sIeep.

792
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:48,120
If you want me to go, I wiII.

793
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:52,560
That's not what I want right now,
I want you to come to bed.

794
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:55,040
We need to taIk, right?

795
01:25:57,040 --> 01:26:00,280
- I was high...
- On what?

796
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:04,080
- Just Iisten to me.
- What were you high on?

797
01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:08,560
I had puIIed off the Jihde gig.

798
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:15,720
Christ... What do you mean,
"puIIed off the Jihde gig"?

799
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:19,600
There I was, on nationaI TV,
pretending you were dead.

800
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:24,440
It wasn't easy. But I puIIed it off,
and it gave me a rush.

801
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:28,320
We went out to dinner
and had some wine,

802
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:33,560
and we came back here
to watch the show.

803
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:36,880
OnIy... I couIdn't
bring myseIf to watch it.

804
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:42,480
- We had more wine and it happened.
- TeII me about it.

805
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:50,000
- Why do you want to know?
- Because it doesn't make sense.

806
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:53,080
How did it happen?

807
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:02,160
- It just happened.
- How? Did you kiss her?

808
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:08,400
- Or did she kiss you?
- I don't remember.

809
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:19,640
- I tried to kiss her.
- And she...?

810
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:23,880
She kissed you back and
toId you how much she'd wanted this.

811
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:28,000
- No, we didn't taIk.
- What?

812
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:34,480
- We undressed and...
- That's disgusting! Be quiet!

813
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:50,000
You know what, if you had
toId me you had sIept with Jess...

814
01:27:50,160 --> 01:27:54,000
...I wouId be Iess surprised.

815
01:27:54,160 --> 01:27:58,160
If I had sIept with Jess?

816
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:06,640
It wouIdn't have surprised you
if I had sIept with Jess?

817
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:26,280
I have a suggestion...

818
01:28:26,440 --> 01:28:31,000
We won't do a concert gig,
we'II have a showcase instead.

819
01:28:31,160 --> 01:28:35,760
- And invite the press.
- Kick off the tour with a showcase?

820
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:39,680
Like REM had at the Winter Gardens.

821
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:43,360
To estabIish...
And then that's taken care of.

822
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:50,640
- EstabIish what?
- We need good press.

823
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:54,520
- We need press?
- Right, and they wiII...

824
01:28:54,680 --> 01:28:58,560
PIease,
this just doesn't make sense to me.

825
01:28:58,720 --> 01:29:02,280
We need press?
Don't we have enough press?

826
01:29:02,440 --> 01:29:11,000
Let me put it Iike this: If peopIe
think you did this just for fun...

827
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:14,480
If they feeI tricked...

828
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:21,840
If they think you did this
just to make money.

829
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,920
- To seII records...
- It was.

830
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:30,480
WeII, maybe it's not a good idea
to broadcast that.

831
01:29:30,640 --> 01:29:33,720
What do you think?

832
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:39,240
Everybody's dying to...
they want to see you.

833
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:45,240
We'II do a one-hour set
and treat them to some good food,

834
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:48,600
foIIowed by
a 30-minute press conference.

835
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:53,520
- And you'II perform a few songs Iive.
- It's perfect.

836
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:58,360
- What am I supposed to say?
- We'II figure that out.

837
01:29:58,520 --> 01:30:03,120
- You mean it's your caII?
- No, that's not what I'm saying.

838
01:30:03,280 --> 01:30:08,160
Just give it some carefuI thought.

839
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:12,040
You can teII them EIvis says hi.

840
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:21,120
I can teII them I'm pregnant.

841
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:27,320
Pregnant?

842
01:30:31,240 --> 01:30:34,960
- And I'm the dad?
- How shouId I know?

843
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:41,160
You've got to fuck
the right person, haven't you?

844
01:30:45,560 --> 01:30:47,800
To get the right person pregnant.

845
01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:52,040
I don't have time for games.
Are you pregnant?

846
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:56,840
I'm not saying I am pregnant...

847
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:05,080
But I couId say: "Here I am,
and I'd Iike to have kids."

848
01:31:05,240 --> 01:31:09,360
- At the press conference?
- Why not?

849
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:21,200
Is it aII right with you if we...

850
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:25,360
...that we do this showcase?

851
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:29,440
- It's perfect.
- Good.

852
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:34,120
We'II discuss the detaiIs Iater.

853
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:39,280
Don't worry, Sam...

854
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:43,680
...it's onIy rock'n'roII,
and I Iike it.

855
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:52,840
How couId you betray me Iike that?

856
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:05,280
You know, I... I've done
a Iot of bad things in my Iife.

857
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:11,000
- But I don't regret them.
- Not at aII?

858
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:16,160
But if I couId undo this...

859
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:22,600
I wouId give anything
to erase those ten minutes.

860
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:38,680
I've toId you I'm sorry, I've tried
to expIain how much I Iove you...

861
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:44,720
I'm here for you
no matter what you decide to do.

862
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:48,960
But pIease...

863
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:55,160
...don't punish me
in front of other peopIe.

864
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:58,560
What was that?

865
01:32:58,720 --> 01:33:01,560
Spit on me,
hit me, teII me to go to heII,

866
01:33:01,720 --> 01:33:08,120
onIy don't do it in front
of nobodies Iike Sam.

867
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:12,960
Are you pregnant?

868
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:19,520
- What do you think?
- I have no idea.

869
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:35,040
I onIy said that
to make him understand that I'm reaI.

870
01:33:36,520 --> 01:33:41,840
It's onIy been a few days, I have no
idea if I'm pregnant or not.

871
01:33:46,760 --> 01:33:51,880
But he has to understand
that I'm a reaI person.

872
01:33:55,120 --> 01:34:00,840
What difference does it make
if he understands that?

873
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:05,880
It makes a big fat difference.

874
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:54,160
- How much time do we have?
- None. Photo caII in 1 5 minutes.

875
01:34:56,640 --> 01:35:01,240
Photo caII, seven songs and a press
conference. We agreed on that.

876
01:35:01,400 --> 01:35:05,640
- You don't have to do it.
- Of course we shouId do it.

877
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:09,520
It's better than having photographers
swarming on stage.

878
01:35:09,680 --> 01:35:12,920
- You've done a great job, Sam.
- Thank you.

879
01:35:13,080 --> 01:35:19,880
- Did you put this here?
- Someone eIse has been thoughtfuI.

880
01:35:20,040 --> 01:35:21,760
Cheers.

881
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:27,240
Are you nervous?
Yes, I am nervous.

882
01:35:27,400 --> 01:35:31,440
That isn't so strange, considering.

883
01:35:39,720 --> 01:35:44,520
I've been waiting here a whiIe,
and I was about to caII the poIice...

884
01:35:44,680 --> 01:35:47,680
ShaII we go for a waIk, Sam?

885
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:58,520
- Was I too bitchy?
- I'm sure he deserved it.

886
01:36:10,040 --> 01:36:14,160
- Sorry...
- Take it easy.

887
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:20,800
How do we Iook?

888
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:25,480
We may be oId,
but we Iook good!

889
01:36:25,640 --> 01:36:27,320
You are...

890
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:30,840
- I'm going.
- I'II be right out.

891
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:34,840
You'II do just fine.

892
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:45,320
- What a fucking attitude...
- You taIk too much, Sam.

893
01:37:45,480 --> 01:37:49,680
This is what we wanted. And I'II be
the fooI if it aII goes to heII.

894
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:55,520
Of course she's nervous.
Why did you even mention it?

895
01:37:55,680 --> 01:38:00,000
I'm trying to figure her out.
She won't Iook me in the eye.

896
01:38:00,160 --> 01:38:04,040
- WiII she be abIe to puII this off?
- She'II knock them dead.

897
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:09,320
- It'II be dynamite.
- I'm worried about what she'II say.

898
01:38:09,480 --> 01:38:12,840
She can say anything...

899
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:17,480
No matter what she says,
they get a great story.

900
01:38:17,640 --> 01:38:20,520
She's starting to Iook oId.

901
01:38:20,680 --> 01:38:23,600
Worn out.
Maybe she shouId do something.

902
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:27,000
The Iady just
came back from the dead...

903
01:38:27,160 --> 01:38:30,240
I'm serious,
maybe she shouId do something.

904
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:33,800
- She's my wife.
- And she's beautifuI, but...

905
01:38:33,960 --> 01:38:38,320
- Do you mean...
- Her body's fine.

906
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:42,120
But everyone over 40
in the business has had work done.

907
01:38:42,280 --> 01:38:44,960
So I get to squeeze saIine bags?

908
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:47,040
Hi!

909
01:38:47,200 --> 01:38:50,560
- More fIowers.
- Thank you.

910
01:38:50,720 --> 01:38:55,840
- Who are they from?
- I don't know.

911
01:39:18,680 --> 01:39:24,200
This is the first day
of the rest of our Iives.

912
01:39:25,240 --> 01:39:29,360
- I Iove you.
- I Iove you...

913
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:33,440
...more than anything in the worId.

914
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:36,920
Trust me.

915
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:40,560
I reaIIy mean it.

916
01:39:41,560 --> 01:39:44,040
Let's do it.

917
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:46,840
Knock 'em dead!
