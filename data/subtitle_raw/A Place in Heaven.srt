1
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:23,284
Blood leaves the body.

2
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,382
Where does it go?

3
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:31,421
Deep down
to the other side of the world

4
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:35,530
leaping out into a heart
that's been waiting for it.

5
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:40,761
A PLACE IN HEAVEN

6
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,629
Do you know a Rabbi Simcha?

7
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:15,929
Simcha Mintz, he used
to live here...

8
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:24,441
Last time, everything you gave me
was full of fat.

9
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:28,278
You bring me the fat on Sunday,
I'll replace it, on the scale, okay?

10
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:34,281
If I checked everything with
a microscope you'd be waiting a week.

11
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:36,351
But it's a good piece.

12
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:40,390
Everybody under this roof
is going to get what they want.

13
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:42,595
Two kilo head.

14
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:47,865
Young man, you're cutting in line.
- People, please.

15
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,538
I'm looking for a Simcha Mintz,
Rabbi Simcha.

16
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,936
Does he live here?

17
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:56,610
Yes, you step out, take a left,
then take a right, alright?

18
00:03:56,869 --> 00:04:00,339
Out of the store, take a right,
you'll see a blue drawing on the wall.

19
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:05,319
Take a left, up the stairs,
it's 8 Ezra street.

20
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:06,990
Second floor,
the door on the right.

21
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:08,485
Yes, Avram...

22
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:11,821
You're a real computer.

23
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:26,665
So, did he find you easily?

24
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,431
Who found me?

25
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:30,699
The fellow that was here yesterday.

26
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:32,499
It was you who sent him?

27
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,804
Did I do something wrong?

28
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,075
No, no, no.

29
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:38,540
Everything happens for a reason.

30
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:43,954
He was a little excited.

31
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,984
I thought I'd help him.

32
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:50,527
It's a long story.

33
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:52,526
You honor me, Rabbi Simcha.

34
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:55,398
Your stories are like
the wisdom of sages.

35
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:00,402
Hey,

36
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:05,772
this helmet is worthless,
got the American ones?

37
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:07,635
That's all we've got.

38
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:17,782
It was in the fifties,

39
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:21,651
Palestinian fighters crossed
the border and we'd strike back.

40
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:23,020
Wild West.

41
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:25,895
Full magazines?

42
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:27,758
Yes sir.
- Water?

43
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:29,361
First Aid Kit?

44
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:33,093
Bambi was like a father
to those soldiers...

45
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:40,476
They knew his operations
were the most dangerous

46
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:45,082
but they loved him no matter what.

47
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:54,019
Good to see you.

48
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:58,428
How's the wife?
- Better.

49
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:00,927
You sure you want to come?

50
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,565
Yes, sir.

51
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:28,658
No... no... no...

52
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,569
This Bambi,
where did he get the name?

53
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:48,044
A girl on the base
saw the movie Bambi.

54
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:53,576
She told her friends that the
commander
looks like Bambi from the movie.

55
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:57,019
The guys started joking around

56
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,820
and when he came over,
they called him Bambi.

57
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:02,219
And that's how he became Bambi.

58
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:05,619
Everybody forgot his real name.

59
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:09,026
And he liked his new name, Bambi.

60
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:11,729
Blessed an thou, Lord, our God,

61
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,871
Who has sanctified us
and commanded us to slaughter.

62
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:22,808
I'd wait for him every time
he went out on a mission.

63
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,671
I was a cook.

64
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,008
They're back!

65
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:33,256
He was like King David.

66
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:37,492
He'd come back from the battle with
one thousand Philistine foreskins.

67
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,255
Proof of his victory.

68
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,136
How many?
- Ten.

69
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:54,545
A squad of ten?
- Ten.

70
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:56,509
You got them all?
- They're all here, I've got proof.

71
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:59,046
How should I know
where you got those genital from?

72
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:02,777
Why are you looking at me?

73
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:06,889
I... No reason.
- Each time, no reason?

74
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,784
You're like the great heroes
of the Bible.

75
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:14,556
You shouldn't envy us.
We die quickly.

76
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:18,534
But the best place in heaven
is reserved for you.

77
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:23,239
Where is this heaven of yours?

78
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:24,937
It's not a place.

79
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:26,935
It's in the next world.

80
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:31,147
How was it... good?

81
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:32,179
Very good, yeah.

82
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,984
Come and see me later.
- After the food. I'm hungry.

83
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,114
Take care.

84
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,579
So, what is the next world?

85
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:42,822
What's over there?
- That's where the souls go.

86
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:44,657
How?

87
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,988
When the spirit leaves the body

88
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:49,598
it returns to its father
the Lord Almighty,

89
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,598
and he decides where to send it.

90
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,031
Heaven or hell?

91
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:54,702
Yes.

92
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:58,041
Why does he want me
by his side so badly?

93
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,232
You risk your life to save Jews.

94
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,608
That's the highest virtue.

95
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:06,783
You're jealous of me.

96
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:10,313
Yes.

97
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,187
I am jealous of you.

98
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:14,085
Take it.

99
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,059
Take my spot.

100
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,922
Take it, I'm giving it to you.

101
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:22,098
What do you want for it?

102
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:24,259
Is this a flea market?

103
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:29,073
It's like in Genesis, when Esau
sold his birthright to Jacob.

104
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:32,970
The Jewish law says it can be sold...
- How much are you paying?

105
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:34,269
A hundred liras.

106
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:39,982
We need a contract and witnesses.
- Alright, write up a contract.

107
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:42,948
Rabbi Simcha, people are
waiting for food here.

108
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:45,348
I'll write up a contract.
- OK, I'm not going anywhere.

109
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:53,326
Two copies,
one for me and one for you.

110
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:56,997
What's that?
- He's selling his place in Heaven.

111
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:00,633
Erase that, I'm not interested
in your hundred liras.

112
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,407
Your scrambled eggs deluxe.

113
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:11,747
Write it instead
of the hundred liras.

114
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,946
And make it red hot.
the way I like it.

115
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:21,148
Scrambled eggs deluxe...

116
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:24,759
Red hot...

117
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:27,123
Also write:
'every day for a month'.

118
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,439
What does this have to do
with the fellow looking for you?

119
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:39,435
The fellow is the son.

120
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:41,336
Bambi's son?

121
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,180
Bambi's son.

122
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,677
He became religious.

123
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:46,407
Bless the Lord, he did.

124
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:50,981
Yesterday, a terrorist
shot his father at the hotel.

125
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:53,088
And what can a good son do?

126
00:11:55,247 --> 00:12:00,094
Look for you, so he can buy
back his father's place in heaven.

127
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:03,961
He came to cancel the contract
after forty years.

128
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:06,897
Would you look at that,

129
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:10,402
the boy is standing here,
his heart is torn,

130
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:14,711
and I am deaf and blind to his pain,
dealing with Boris's fat.

131
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:18,176
Did you give him a good cut?
That's important too.

132
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:21,175
That's the beauty of creation.

133
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:26,045
The Lord Almighty gives you
a part to play, and you do it.

134
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:29,156
You do your part and you leave.

135
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:32,092
It's all over in a bang.

136
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,021
All the best.

137
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:37,822
Ayala, tell me,

138
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:42,832
why do you keep running from me?
- Running?

139
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:46,836
I don't know.

140
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:48,369
Scrambled eggs deluxe...

141
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:53,374
It's the last one.

142
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:57,572
You want some?

143
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:06,115
Here you go.

144
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,599
I need my father's blessing.

145
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,102
Alright.

146
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:05,174
Let's go?

147
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:06,509
Let's go.

148
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:50,320
Haven't you got women of your own,

149
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:53,025
you've got to have my daughter?

150
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:57,129
I want her to give me a son.

151
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:58,467
What's that?

152
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:00,933
I want her to give me a son.

153
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:03,501
Cheers.

154
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:12,046
I had four children.

155
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:14,674
Three boys and a daughter.

156
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:19,056
I lost the boys when we walked
from Yemen to Israel.

157
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:22,287
The first had a fever for days
and passed away.

158
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:28,459
The second ate something bad that
a woman gave him, and passed away.

159
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:36,501
The third fell and never got up.
I just looked away for one second...

160
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:38,675
We came here just me and her.

161
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:44,603
Her son is like my son.

162
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,075
His father must be God-fearing.

163
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:53,454
That means obeying
the commandments.

164
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:56,683
He's scared the soldier...

165
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:58,494
I'll obey the commandments.

166
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,061
That easily?

167
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:02,163
You have to know how.

168
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,095
You have to learn.

169
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:06,565
To show perseverance.

170
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:09,072
Let him be, rabbi.

171
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,133
I'll learn.

172
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,501
I'll persevere.

173
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:16,012
Are you trying to fool me?

174
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:20,006
Many have tried and failed.

175
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,685
That's the wine talking, rabbi.

176
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,612
Shut up or leave!

177
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:26,554
Are we children?

178
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:29,418
I want to see it with my own eyes.

179
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,696
You'll live here and work.

180
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:37,796
I'll pay you what I give an Arab boy
I'll give you food and a bed.

181
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:41,628
It's the first rain now.

182
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:44,068
Till the first rain next year.

183
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:46,776
Let's see you obey
the commandments and work.

184
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:49,712
I'm in the army,
how can I work here a year?

185
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,339
You want the army?

186
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,174
Your wish is your honor.

187
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:56,042
But don't come to this house again.

188
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,085
It's not how we do things here.

189
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:04,753
Goodbye, rabbi.

190
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:12,395
Three dignified men from synagogue
asked to marry her to their sons.

191
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:14,626
What makes you better than them?

192
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:20,701
If I meet your terms,
you swear you'll give her to me?

193
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,677
My word is like an oath.

194
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:25,746
You swear you'll give her to me?

195
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,087
I swear.

196
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:56,278
Quiet.

197
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:07,451
Two, four, six, seven.
It's called "tefillin".

198
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:14,428
Why does a Jew bind his arm
in these straps every morning?

199
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:21,263
To remind himself each morning
right when he gets up

200
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:24,269
that there is someone above him.

201
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:27,842
You bind yourself and become free.

202
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:32,179
Now hold this with your finger.
Yes, hold it down.

203
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:38,151
Now the "tefillin" for the head.

204
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:29,494
"Let's go, my beloved,
to meet the bride,

205
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:36,778
"And let us welcome
the presence of the Sabbath."

206
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:40,974
"I will betroth you to me
with Righteousness and with justice

207
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:45,311
"And with kindness and with mercy."

208
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,481
I'm clearing your shit hole.

209
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:16,784
I got a job from your dad,

210
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:22,316
every Friday morning,

211
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:25,354
so it won't smell
during your Sabbath blessings.

212
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:32,001
You left me a lot of work this week.

213
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,600
Let's run away.

214
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:39,467
I promised.

215
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:42,973
I can't.

216
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:21,900
Ahmed... Ahmed...

217
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:24,842
Your great Egyptian president
knows how to make noise,

218
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:28,017
but during wartime,
he runs away.

219
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,853
He's all hot air,
nothing but talk.

220
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:34,421
Not true, he can also run away...
like a bunny.

221
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:37,492
Only thanks to your prayers
our army wins. Let's go.

222
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,909
Reading about your
army in the paper?

223
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:01,508
Just the headlines. ( in Arabic)

224
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,482
Is it worth missing a war
for a girl's cunt?

225
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:08,114
Fuck your army.

226
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:44,625
Blessed are thy
that dwell in your house

227
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,955
Blessed is the people
of whom this is true;

228
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,962
blessed is the people
whose God is the Lord.

229
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:52,519
Can you manage in the field?

230
00:25:52,684 --> 00:25:54,823
Huh?
- Can you manage in the field?

231
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:56,928
God Willing.

232
00:25:57,122 --> 00:25:58,931
We'll find someone...

233
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:03,604
It's harsh here in the winter.

234
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:07,970
I should have done some work,
fixed the ceiling,

235
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:12,246
let you into the house on Sabbath.

236
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:17,876
Thank you.

237
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:23,050
You are like a son to me now.

238
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:26,186
I wanted to ask something of you.

239
00:26:28,186 --> 00:26:31,690
After I leave this world,
say the Kaddish prayer for my soul.

240
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,927
Every memorial, at synagogue,

241
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:36,731
so my soul can rest
in the next world.

242
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:41,604
You don't have to believe it,
just say the words.

243
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:45,078
We had a deal.

244
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,147
I gave you everything you wanted.

245
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:49,344
I have nothing left to give you.

246
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:54,121
Measure for measure.

247
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:57,851
You too won't get what you want.

248
00:27:09,928 --> 00:27:11,373
Goodbye, father.

249
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,174
Goodbye.

250
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,140
A rich family used to live here.

251
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,706
It's beautiful.

252
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:22,003
An Arab village is a beautiful place.

253
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:25,405
It's so close to the border,
you can see Jerusalem's walls.

254
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:28,182
You're worried about
Jordanian snipers. Show me.

255
00:28:34,312 --> 00:28:35,313
Watch out.

256
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,699
An Arab pacifier.

257
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:50,199
That goes to the baby's mouth
and the bell tells where it is.

258
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:52,238
I'll keep it.

259
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:54,166
For luck.

260
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,173
Here.

261
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:02,849
From here to here,
it's only two meters, see?

262
00:29:04,175 --> 00:29:06,155
From here to here.

263
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:09,155
That's where they can fire at us.
- That's enough.

264
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:10,458
We can bend over.

265
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:14,455
Every time you come here,
you'll bend over?

266
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:16,161
Why not?

267
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:18,762
And when we have a child?

268
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:22,169
When our child is born, all this
will already be part of Israel.

269
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,237
You see, all this.

270
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:33,146
We'll have a son,
no matter what he said,

271
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:35,477
and he'll play here,
in this yard.

272
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:58,099
Go to sleep, little one.

273
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:24,832
She's sleeping.

274
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:32,500
You're going back to base tonight?

275
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:35,134
It's OK, I like driving at night.

276
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:40,243
I wanted us to try this month too.

277
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:42,179
I'm glad you called me over.

278
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:51,357
Are you worried about me?

279
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:56,122
I want you to have
what you want, to be happy.

280
00:30:56,321 --> 00:31:00,827
It's OK. It took us 5 years to get
pregnant,
another 5 don't scare me.

281
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:04,029
It only means we'll be happier
when it happens.

282
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:05,037
Yeah...

283
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,839
And this time it'll be a boy.

284
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,277
Why shouldn't it be?

285
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:14,212
No reason.

286
00:31:14,405 --> 00:31:15,975
Give me one reason.

287
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:20,017
What your father said
doesn't trouble me.

288
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:22,122
It's nothing, not even nonsense.

289
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:23,348
It's going to be a boy.

290
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:25,118
I deserve it.

291
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:50,478
Good, I think he'll like it.

292
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,462
Turn around.

293
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:11,066
Who knows why, mama...

294
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:14,933
The Zebra wears a pyjama?

295
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:22,316
They say there's going to be a war.

296
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:25,214
What needs to be will be.

297
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,226
Forgive him, father.

298
00:32:37,488 --> 00:32:41,959
Look at how the older one

299
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,303
holds her sister's hand.

300
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:46,141
Good girl.

301
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:50,204
I have forgiven him.

302
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:54,309
But it's not for me to decide.

303
00:33:00,244 --> 00:33:02,690
I'll be gone in a little bit.

304
00:33:03,047 --> 00:33:06,961
No, no... it's true.
Every man has his time.

305
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:12,399
But who will say the Kaddish prayer
over me? Just the gravedigger.

306
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:16,104
Talk to him.

307
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:19,265
Tell him that if he prays
for my soul

308
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:22,405
I will do what I can from up there.

309
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,012
To get him what he wants.

310
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:29,750
The doctors say I can't give birth
again, that it's too dangerous.

311
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:33,516
You believe the doctors
or your father?

312
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:36,184
You.

313
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:39,152
Good girl.

314
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:42,763
I'm sorry, daddy.

315
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:47,069
Enough, enough, sweetheart.
- Sorry.

316
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:54,369
If I had chosen your husband,

317
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,642
would you be hugging me like this?

318
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:04,451
So in the end I've won.

319
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:17,562
Is there anybody from the family,
who can say the Kaddish prayer?

320
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:22,564
No one?

321
00:34:26,597 --> 00:34:29,407
May his Great Name
Grow exalted and sanctified.

322
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,476
Amen.

323
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:33,205
In the world that
He created as He willed.

324
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:36,476
May He give reign
to His kingship in your lifetimes

325
00:34:36,707 --> 00:34:40,780
and in the lifetimes of the entire
Family of Israel. Now say: Amen.

326
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:42,682
You're mad at me?

327
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:44,409
Yes.

328
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:35,927
Why don't you go back to the radio?

329
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:38,838
They need people there now.

330
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:41,571
I'm sick of working in the radio.

331
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:50,281
I want you to have a baby
with another woman.

332
00:36:54,278 --> 00:36:57,521
One cinnamon,
one raisons and cheese.

333
00:36:57,848 --> 00:36:59,486
Don't let it get cold.

334
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:05,633
Wait...

335
00:37:05,823 --> 00:37:07,564
Don't let it get cold.

336
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:22,710
There you go.

337
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:29,255
A paratrooper's officer
here with us...

338
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:31,552
Does this mean there won't be a war?

339
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:34,523
There will be.
And we're going to win. -Oops.

340
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:36,494
That's okay, it's nothing.

341
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:39,964
It's fine.
Good, just one second.

342
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:44,668
We'll swap it. Bon Appetite.

343
00:37:51,335 --> 00:37:52,973
You'll be pregnant again.

344
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:15,835
Hey,

345
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:19,998
daddy loves you.

346
00:38:24,835 --> 00:38:28,806
I read that in America they can
find out if it's a boy or a girl.

347
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,478
An ultrasound.

348
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:37,484
Listen.

349
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,955
It flew off.

350
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:51,373
I'll make it to the birth,

351
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,334
I promise.

352
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:04,043
Go into the synagogue, say
the Kaddish prayer for his soul.

353
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:10,726
It's not a Yemenite synagogue,
is that okay with him?

354
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:17,692
Alright.

355
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:23,603
If it's so important to you.

356
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:26,638
It's nonsense, it's not a big deal.

357
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,809
But not today,
when I get back.

358
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:34,982
I promise.

359
00:39:37,908 --> 00:39:39,353
Grab the other hand...

360
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:46,692
Something's stuck here.

361
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:47,862
Just the legs...

362
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:50,658
Take it to the jeep
put it with the other bodies.

363
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:53,859
Don't leave anything behind,
get all the pieces.

364
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:12,045
Need some help here.

365
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:25,923
Soldier.

366
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,593
Soldier, hey.

367
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,065
What's your name?

368
00:40:32,496 --> 00:40:33,998
What's your name?
- Asaf...

369
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:38,078
Asaf, listen to me.

370
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:42,675
Asaf. Look at me.

371
00:40:42,973 --> 00:40:44,577
Asaf, look at me.

372
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:47,881
We've got to get all of him,
there are more pieces left.

373
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:48,920
Alright.

374
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,889
There is more of Asaf...
- Alright, don't worry.

375
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:57,098
We'll get all the pieces home.

376
00:40:58,656 --> 00:40:59,964
And what is your name?

377
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:02,933
What is your name, son?

378
00:41:03,894 --> 00:41:05,032
Me?

379
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:08,836
Nimrod.

380
00:41:12,503 --> 00:41:13,709
Nimrod...

381
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:20,078
Do what I say
and I'll get you out of here.

382
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:23,458
I promise to take care of you.

383
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:26,519
I want to get out of here.

384
00:41:26,717 --> 00:41:28,060
You want to live?

385
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:30,188
Look at me.

386
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:33,227
Alone, you don't stand a chance.
You'll die.

387
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:35,867
Sir, sir.
- What do you want?

388
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:38,630
We'll leave him here, we gotta go.
- Get out of here.

389
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:42,101
Sir, he's shell-shocked.
He's done.

390
00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:44,774
Go away! - Our men are going
to start running away.

391
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:59,661
Where are you from, Nimrod?
- Haifa.

392
00:42:03,053 --> 00:42:05,533
What do you want to
do when you get out?

393
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:08,167
Here... take it...

394
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,501
I have a girlfriend.

395
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,041
What's your position in the tank?

396
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:21,978
Loader, sir.

397
00:42:22,172 --> 00:42:23,981
You'll be my loader.

398
00:42:24,174 --> 00:42:25,710
I'll take care of you.

399
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:27,512
Deal?

400
00:42:30,948 --> 00:42:32,188
Good.

401
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,794
And after that, son
we'll go home.

402
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:36,730
Sir...

403
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:38,894
someone from command.

404
00:42:45,095 --> 00:42:48,133
Prince, this is Bambi,
leaving for the oil axis in five.

405
00:42:48,332 --> 00:42:49,572
Do you copy, over?

406
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:53,772
Move now, the Syrians are advancing,
there's nobody left over there!

407
00:42:55,205 --> 00:42:57,082
Go slow, slow. Take your time.

408
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:09,820
You're my boy, you're my son...

409
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:25,338
Let's move, keep your eyes open.

410
00:43:46,256 --> 00:43:47,894
The cannon is gone, right?

411
00:43:48,092 --> 00:43:49,127
Yeah, goddamit.

412
00:43:49,326 --> 00:43:50,669
Give me a light.

413
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:53,235
Then the tank is worthless.
- Yes.

414
00:43:54,264 --> 00:43:55,766
This tank goes home.

415
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,640
Okay.

416
00:43:58,369 --> 00:44:00,610
Who's wounded, Moti?
- Yes, Moti.

417
00:44:01,905 --> 00:44:05,785
Get him on the busted tank with two
healthy soldiers. They're going home.

418
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:09,688
Who should I take?

419
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:13,654
I want to go home.

420
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:17,691
No, you stay with me.

421
00:44:17,888 --> 00:44:19,925
Erez, you and your driver.

422
00:44:20,124 --> 00:44:21,967
You get on the busted tank.
You're going home.

423
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:24,070
I'll take the good tank.
- Yes, sir.

424
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:26,102
We're heading out.

425
00:44:26,296 --> 00:44:27,297
Yes, sir.

426
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:32,670
Give us their ammo
before they leave.

427
00:44:37,908 --> 00:44:40,218
Here, son, hide it.

428
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:12,946
Watch over me, watch over me,

429
00:45:13,944 --> 00:45:15,423
I'll be with you forever.

430
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:28,297
The Syrian have a battalion up there,
maybe more.

431
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:29,903
Maybe forty, fifty tanks.

432
00:45:30,127 --> 00:45:31,800
You saw the Syrians today.

433
00:45:32,029 --> 00:45:33,702
They fight like lions.

434
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:35,467
I want to see that you're better.

435
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:37,177
Yes, sir.

436
00:45:39,203 --> 00:45:40,307
Out.

437
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:44,915
Go on, son, take command.

438
00:45:47,111 --> 00:45:48,818
Give the orders properly.

439
00:45:49,012 --> 00:45:51,390
You know how long it's been
since I was in a tank?

440
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:17,010
Danny, break right, hard.

441
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:19,448
More, more, that's it. Stop.

442
00:46:20,477 --> 00:46:22,753
One Bambi, this is Bambi,
we're hit, over.

443
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:24,186
Where are we hit?

444
00:46:24,381 --> 00:46:26,019
There's a lot of smoke.

445
00:46:26,216 --> 00:46:29,129
They hit Rami's tank.
- Rami, what's going on?

446
00:46:29,319 --> 00:46:30,957
Rami, talk to me.

447
00:46:31,221 --> 00:46:33,428
Anybody, Mussa, Gadi,

448
00:46:33,824 --> 00:46:36,270
What's the driver's name?
What's the driver's name?

449
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:37,336
They're all dead.

450
00:46:37,528 --> 00:46:40,998
They're all dead because
they're idiots. We're not!

451
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:28,255
We won...

452
00:47:32,549 --> 00:47:33,926
Son, we won.

453
00:47:45,162 --> 00:47:46,436
You were good.

454
00:47:51,101 --> 00:47:52,239
We won...

455
00:48:23,533 --> 00:48:26,036
We're hit...
- Put him down here...

456
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:29,917
Mom...

457
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,898
The bandage... undo it...

458
00:48:46,957 --> 00:48:48,095
Gently.

459
00:48:49,693 --> 00:48:53,072
What's going on...
Lean your head back, son... yes...

460
00:48:53,563 --> 00:48:56,976
Mom... Mom...

461
00:48:57,167 --> 00:48:59,238
Nimrod... Nimrod...

462
00:49:03,307 --> 00:49:04,911
Stay with me...

463
00:49:05,075 --> 00:49:07,214
Let's get out of here already.

464
00:49:07,411 --> 00:49:12,622
Mom... - No, Nimrod, no...
Here I am, talk to me...

465
00:49:13,083 --> 00:49:17,361
Talk to me! Talk!
Nimrod!

466
00:49:17,554 --> 00:49:21,263
He's dead! Let's get out
of here before we get hit again.

467
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:50,431
Dr. Shekter.

468
00:50:36,066 --> 00:50:38,012
You're the general's son.

469
00:50:38,435 --> 00:50:40,244
He's in a meeting now.

470
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:43,210
I know, I'm going into
an interview with him.

471
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,647
You'll be his new secretary?

472
00:50:46,576 --> 00:50:48,021
Maybe.

473
00:50:52,582 --> 00:50:54,653
Your dad's?
- Yeah.

474
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:56,053
Alright, put it on.

475
00:50:58,121 --> 00:50:59,099
Thanks.

476
00:51:00,657 --> 00:51:04,036
Call back command,
they're waiting for an answer...

477
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:08,068
The new girls are here.
Should I send them in?

478
00:51:19,843 --> 00:51:21,823
There's no need.
Sit down.

479
00:51:22,279 --> 00:51:26,193
I'll take her.
Get her trained for the job

480
00:51:26,383 --> 00:51:27,157
No problem.

481
00:51:27,384 --> 00:51:29,591
Prince, wait up for me,
we'll have lunch together.

482
00:51:29,786 --> 00:51:31,265
Defend yourself...

483
00:51:44,468 --> 00:51:47,278
You hit it, yeah...

484
00:51:48,338 --> 00:51:51,285
You got it, you got it.

485
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:18,711
Tomorrow morning they'll announce
that your dad's the Chief of Staff.

486
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:21,441
Tomorrow morning.

487
00:52:25,342 --> 00:52:28,687
Dad, dad, Nimrod's coming down.

488
00:52:28,879 --> 00:52:30,483
Enough. Leave dad alone.

489
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,489
Dad.
- Enough.

490
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:38,163
Nimrodi, Nimrod, Nimrodi,

491
00:52:39,256 --> 00:52:41,793
Come on, you have to go to school.
Where's your backpack?

492
00:52:42,626 --> 00:52:44,128
You need a sandwich!

493
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:46,864
Ahinoam, make him a sandwich.
- Not now.

494
00:52:47,697 --> 00:52:49,734
Ahinoam, make him a sandwich.

495
00:52:57,407 --> 00:53:03,221
Dad, what's wrong? Dad.

496
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:04,920
Nimrod!

497
00:53:11,922 --> 00:53:15,335
Here's the sandwich.
- Can't you add some butter...

498
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:27,841
Sandwich bag.

499
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:40,787
"Evidence of War Crimes in the 50s"

500
00:53:42,419 --> 00:53:50,236
"General Samuel ( Bambi) Elifaz
Suspected
Of Cutting Off Enemy Genitalia"

501
00:53:50,527 --> 00:53:51,767
Napkin.

502
00:53:52,329 --> 00:53:53,774
Put it in your backpack.

503
00:53:53,964 --> 00:53:56,240
Your lunch is in the fridge.

504
00:54:03,673 --> 00:54:05,346
What are you doing?

505
00:54:14,451 --> 00:54:16,727
Boy, give that paper back.

506
00:54:22,392 --> 00:54:26,465
The blood from our fingertips
has to make it to the heart.

507
00:54:26,663 --> 00:54:32,375
But it's got a long way to go,
so the heart helps it.

508
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:34,639
The heart is like a big pump...

509
00:54:38,675 --> 00:54:40,655
Why'd you hit them?

510
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:42,855
No reason.

511
00:54:43,713 --> 00:54:45,420
You hit for no reason?

512
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:46,821
Look at me.

513
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:49,730
Is it about me?

514
00:54:49,919 --> 00:54:51,728
No, they were cheating at a game.

515
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:54,867
They were cheating, I told you.

516
00:55:00,764 --> 00:55:02,710
They were cheating at a game.

517
00:55:21,051 --> 00:55:22,553
You're not an animal.

518
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:25,358
Learn to restrain yourself.

519
00:55:26,356 --> 00:55:28,597
Like you restrained yourself?

520
00:55:29,926 --> 00:55:34,466
That's the way it was back then.
They did it to us and we did it back.

521
00:56:19,676 --> 00:56:21,053
What's a "disgrace"?

522
00:56:21,411 --> 00:56:23,015
Papers are nonsense. Get in.

523
00:56:25,148 --> 00:56:27,025
Are they going to kick
my dad out of the army?

524
00:56:27,417 --> 00:56:30,660
No one can do that to your dad.
Who's better than your dad?

525
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:33,060
Your dad was the hero
of the 73 war...

526
00:56:33,423 --> 00:56:35,061
They're all shit, they're jealous.

527
00:56:35,425 --> 00:56:37,132
Alright, you'll ride up front today?

528
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:50,618
I'm going in.

529
00:56:51,975 --> 00:56:53,147
Are you happy?

530
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:54,580
Why?

531
00:56:55,545 --> 00:56:57,388
We have more time together.

532
00:56:58,181 --> 00:56:59,489
Yeah.

533
00:56:59,716 --> 00:57:00,956
Disgraceful.

534
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:08,565
Nimrod... Nimrod...

535
00:57:12,061 --> 00:57:13,563
If anybody makes fun of you,

536
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:17,108
you tell them your dad is
going to be the Prime Minister.

537
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:21,445
You tell them one year...

538
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:26,117
One year from now,
you'll be moving into the PM's house.

539
00:57:26,876 --> 00:57:30,016
You remember I showed
you where he lives? -Yeah.

540
00:57:34,717 --> 00:57:35,855
One year!

541
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:39,994
I promise!

542
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:23,473
I don't want to...

543
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:31,516
Enough, what do you want?

544
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:27,105
"We hereby agree on transferring

545
00:59:27,297 --> 00:59:29,777
"Samuel ( Bambi) Elifaz's
place in heaven

546
00:59:29,966 --> 00:59:32,310
"to Simcha ( Rabbi Simcha) Mintz"

547
01:00:19,649 --> 01:00:20,923
Nimrod...

548
01:00:27,323 --> 01:00:28,927
Nimrod.

549
01:00:38,334 --> 01:00:42,282
For the 1973 War Anniversary
conference Reception, take a right.

550
01:00:42,672 --> 01:00:44,652
There's food and drink, enjoy...

551
01:00:44,841 --> 01:00:46,218
Hello, welcome.

552
01:00:46,409 --> 01:00:50,152
For the 1973 War Anniversary
conference Reception...

553
01:00:52,749 --> 01:00:55,252
I'm second on the panel, you see?

554
01:00:57,787 --> 01:01:00,631
Take the room's voucher,

555
01:01:01,290 --> 01:01:03,770
and fold it up, in your pocket...

556
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:05,634
Come.

557
01:01:08,197 --> 01:01:09,267
Hello.

558
01:01:09,699 --> 01:01:11,906
There's refreshments, want some?

559
01:01:16,305 --> 01:01:17,409
Hello.

560
01:01:17,807 --> 01:01:20,686
There he is, the Minister of Defense.

561
01:01:21,077 --> 01:01:23,683
He used to be my soldier.
- Bambi, I got you a meeting

562
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:25,188
with the President's cousin...

563
01:01:25,381 --> 01:01:27,190
He works out of the Congo...
- Not now.

564
01:01:30,253 --> 01:01:34,668
I want you to meet him,
he was my soldier.

565
01:01:35,892 --> 01:01:38,668
I could have been in his place today.
- Sir, stay back please.

566
01:01:38,828 --> 01:01:41,206
It's okay, I know him. David!
- Sir, please.

567
01:01:41,397 --> 01:01:43,274
It's fine, I'm staying back.
David.

568
01:01:43,466 --> 01:01:45,446
Hello.
- Hello.

569
01:01:45,835 --> 01:01:48,679
Leah Belkin, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

570
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:52,914
You don't know me,
but we're connected somehow.

571
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:58,290
Nimrod's mother.

572
01:02:00,149 --> 01:02:01,719
You remember?

573
01:02:02,752 --> 01:02:04,754
We never got a chance to speak.

574
01:02:05,955 --> 01:02:08,367
He was one of my soldiers.

575
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:13,706
When I came to console the
family I was asked not to come in.

576
01:02:14,063 --> 01:02:17,237
It was a bit fresh, you know.

577
01:02:17,467 --> 01:02:19,845
So, you're here to speak
at the conference?

578
01:02:20,036 --> 01:02:21,071
Yes.

579
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:23,216
It's an important conference,
It was an important battle.

580
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:24,783
I was a part of it.

581
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:28,082
Yes, it was an important
battle for me too.

582
01:02:28,277 --> 01:02:31,156
Before it I had a life.
And after it, I didn't.

583
01:02:34,283 --> 01:02:36,456
You've got nothing to say?

584
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:41,099
You're thinking, let this crazy
lady make a scene and then leave.

585
01:02:42,158 --> 01:02:44,798
It's a pain that never leaves.
I know.

586
01:02:45,962 --> 01:02:47,270
You don't know.

587
01:02:49,932 --> 01:02:55,075
I heard his best friend, Asaf,
was killed by his side

588
01:02:55,271 --> 01:02:58,377
a few hours beforehand.
- That's true.

589
01:02:59,509 --> 01:03:05,255
But if I'd left him in the field,
he wouldn't have made it.

590
01:03:05,982 --> 01:03:07,757
How would you know?

591
01:03:08,217 --> 01:03:09,958
Are you God?

592
01:03:10,386 --> 01:03:13,094
At least he would have had a chance.

593
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:17,897
Mom, come on.

594
01:03:19,228 --> 01:03:20,935
I won't leave you.

595
01:03:21,998 --> 01:03:24,444
Wherever you go I'll chase you.

596
01:03:25,535 --> 01:03:27,446
Whenever you fall,

597
01:03:27,837 --> 01:03:29,111
you'll know it was me.

598
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:32,252
I know important people.

599
01:03:34,010 --> 01:03:37,355
Not everybody's your pawn.
- Mom, let's go...

600
01:04:15,184 --> 01:04:17,528
Look at that, they're using
rounded clubs.

601
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:20,999
What good is that?
You need an angle, a square.

602
01:04:24,227 --> 01:04:26,571
Beat the Palestinians
to break their bones.

603
01:04:27,330 --> 01:04:29,003
Here, honey, it's sweet.

604
01:04:31,634 --> 01:04:34,615
In Russia they'd do
"Boom Boom" to them all.

605
01:04:34,971 --> 01:04:36,416
Mistake.

606
01:04:38,007 --> 01:04:41,352
Today, wars are fought
on this screen.

607
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:45,321
Round clubs, square clubs,
it all looks the same on TV.

608
01:04:49,485 --> 01:04:50,623
I'll talk to him.

609
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:52,556
Rabin was my Company Commander.

610
01:04:53,089 --> 01:04:55,194
He's not an idiot like the others.

611
01:05:00,596 --> 01:05:02,075
I'll talk to him.

612
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:08,378
Fools, fools.

613
01:05:13,542 --> 01:05:17,649
You need angles, squares, triangles.

614
01:05:22,685 --> 01:05:24,255
Why aren't you eating?

615
01:05:27,256 --> 01:05:28,894
Idiots.

616
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:34,033
I'm done.

617
01:05:39,168 --> 01:05:41,045
He's mad at you.
- He'll get over it.

618
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:44,009
Everything passes.

619
01:06:42,365 --> 01:06:43,366
Samuel?

620
01:06:46,502 --> 01:06:47,572
Hello.

621
01:06:48,571 --> 01:06:50,141
Your father was worried.

622
01:06:51,173 --> 01:06:52,675
Is everything alright?

623
01:06:54,643 --> 01:06:56,054
Are you mad at me?

624
01:06:57,580 --> 01:06:58,752
No.

625
01:06:59,248 --> 01:07:00,420
You're allowed to be.

626
01:07:00,616 --> 01:07:02,118
Your sisters are mad.

627
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:06,395
How do you know?

628
01:07:06,589 --> 01:07:09,069
Because since I've been here,
they stopped coming by.

629
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:12,266
I'm not mad at you.

630
01:07:15,064 --> 01:07:18,773
You know, it's no good living
with someone who's mad at you.

631
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:27,018
I'll talk to your father,

632
01:07:28,077 --> 01:07:31,547
he'll let you have your Bar Mitzvah
like your friends.

633
01:07:33,349 --> 01:07:35,693
If I'll ask him, he'll agree
Even though he hates religion.

634
01:07:37,787 --> 01:07:39,664
I know how much it matters to you.

635
01:07:40,423 --> 01:07:42,494
I've seen you do that thing,

636
01:07:43,459 --> 01:07:46,133
with those black straps on your arm.

637
01:07:50,566 --> 01:07:53,069
I don't want you
to ask anything for me.

638
01:07:53,402 --> 01:07:55,040
You're angry at me.

639
01:07:56,238 --> 01:07:57,615
I'm not.

640
01:07:58,274 --> 01:08:00,083
I feel sorry for you.

641
01:08:03,379 --> 01:08:07,156
I saw you in the pictures they sent him
from Russia with other girls.

642
01:08:07,349 --> 01:08:08,589
But he chose me, didn't he?

643
01:08:10,553 --> 01:08:12,692
A beautiful woman
is a good thing.

644
01:08:14,423 --> 01:08:17,267
Samuel, come here, baby...

645
01:08:17,726 --> 01:08:19,364
Come to bed... Come...

646
01:08:27,303 --> 01:08:31,183
It's a problem, you can't get
into any of the good units.

647
01:08:31,373 --> 01:08:33,649
There are good positions
with intelligence units too.

648
01:08:34,477 --> 01:08:37,617
You can't have a military career
unless you come from an elite unit.

649
01:08:39,849 --> 01:08:41,658
What's this medical note you got?

650
01:08:42,618 --> 01:08:45,827
A murmur.
Something in the heart.

651
01:08:47,723 --> 01:08:50,533
I was worried they'd find out
I'm color-blind.

652
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:53,497
Don't worry about the murmur,
I'll take care of it.

653
01:09:00,202 --> 01:09:02,375
It's a blackout, the entire block.

654
01:09:28,264 --> 01:09:30,710
You know, I never told you,

655
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:36,412
a few years ago...

656
01:09:37,673 --> 01:09:39,619
I thought about leaving it all,

657
01:09:41,410 --> 01:09:42,684
going to Africa,

658
01:09:42,878 --> 01:09:46,325
I wanted to see what this
making money thing is all about,

659
01:09:46,782 --> 01:09:49,422
I wanted to cheat myself,

660
01:09:50,886 --> 01:09:54,595
like dying and taking a pill
against the pain...

661
01:09:57,326 --> 01:09:59,328
Then I thought of another option,

662
01:09:59,562 --> 01:10:02,236
I'd go into the office
of the Minister of Defense...

663
01:10:02,498 --> 01:10:04,273
I know that it was him behind it all.

664
01:10:04,466 --> 01:10:06,207
I put together a whole file...

665
01:10:08,571 --> 01:10:10,551
I never talked to you about it.

666
01:10:10,806 --> 01:10:12,683
I wanted you to grow up clean.

667
01:10:13,776 --> 01:10:16,279
I thought of going to his office
with my gun,

668
01:10:16,478 --> 01:10:18,185
to the Minister of Defense...

669
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:22,362
Security never disarmed me...

670
01:10:22,885 --> 01:10:25,331
When we were in the room together,

671
01:10:25,521 --> 01:10:28,229
after they served us coffee
and all that,

672
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:31,394
I'd pull out the gun,
<i>look</i> him in the eyes and shoot.

673
01:10:32,761 --> 01:10:35,833
Prison is not a factor.

674
01:10:36,131 --> 01:10:36,264


675
01:10:36,265 --> 01:10:38,939
I care about what they'll say
in 50 years, in 100 years,

676
01:10:39,301 --> 01:10:41,372
what will people think
when they hear the name Bambi...

677
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:42,640
The lights are on.

678
01:10:42,838 --> 01:10:46,581
I'm sure it would have put me
in a very good spot.

679
01:10:49,678 --> 01:10:55,219
Only a man who's been horribly
wronged would do something like that.

680
01:10:57,753 --> 01:10:59,994
That was the other option.

681
01:11:04,393 --> 01:11:06,236
Then I looked at you.

682
01:11:08,864 --> 01:11:12,311
Tell me, maybe you know,

683
01:11:15,904 --> 01:11:22,287
how does a baby become a boy,
and then a teen, and now a man.

684
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:26,624
Is this a miracle?
Is that what it's called?

685
01:11:30,586 --> 01:11:32,259
That was my strength.

686
01:11:33,656 --> 01:11:35,465
Watching you grow up.

687
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:40,702
That's how I knew
I had something better.

688
01:11:43,832 --> 01:11:47,006
I've got you instead of a gun,
you see?

689
01:11:48,637 --> 01:11:50,708
You're done? Want a cigarette?

690
01:11:51,573 --> 01:11:53,814
Take it, take it...

691
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:14,964
What's wrong, Nimrod?
- I can't breathe, my heart.

692
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:16,366
Get the doctor.
- What's wrong?

693
01:12:16,565 --> 01:12:17,942
I twisted my ankle.

694
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:20,746
Your ankle? You said
you can't breathe...

695
01:12:20,936 --> 01:12:22,506
It's just an ankle,
calm down.

696
01:12:22,705 --> 01:12:23,581
Stretcher.

697
01:12:27,076 --> 01:12:28,521
Careful. Careful.

698
01:12:31,513 --> 01:12:32,583
Tie him down.

699
01:13:15,057 --> 01:13:17,970
We need one more man to make
ten for the prayer. Anybody?

700
01:15:01,029 --> 01:15:02,099
Medic.

701
01:15:06,568 --> 01:15:08,138
Medic.

702
01:15:34,663 --> 01:15:37,872
When are you back with your unit?
You look strong already.

703
01:15:39,001 --> 01:15:40,674
The army doesn't think so.

704
01:15:41,236 --> 01:15:42,874
They're on to my murmur too.

705
01:15:43,939 --> 01:15:45,509
Watch out, it's hot.

706
01:15:49,912 --> 01:15:52,085
Eat, eat the meat.

707
01:15:55,083 --> 01:15:56,790
Leave those weeds alone.

708
01:15:57,553 --> 01:15:58,759
Salt...

709
01:16:03,859 --> 01:16:05,532
If it was up to me,

710
01:16:05,694 --> 01:16:07,674
instead of a month off
from the army,

711
01:16:08,196 --> 01:16:10,767
I'd put you in jail.

712
01:16:14,736 --> 01:16:16,807
Strapping "tefillin" in an ambush...

713
01:16:17,873 --> 01:16:21,082
Your commander should be deposed
for not putting you there.

714
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:23,648
Salt.

715
01:16:26,648 --> 01:16:29,094
Run for Prime Minister again
and you can depose them all.

716
01:16:37,159 --> 01:16:39,070
I got one good thing out of you.

717
01:16:41,363 --> 01:16:43,900
If not for you,
your mother would be here now.

718
01:16:44,299 --> 01:16:46,336
A pot-bellied 60-year-old lady.

719
01:16:48,236 --> 01:16:52,742
Thanks to you, I have this.

720
01:17:06,021 --> 01:17:09,594
Eat her food.
- I eat kosher. I don't eat pork.

721
01:17:28,710 --> 01:17:30,781
I want you to get off the pill.

722
01:17:32,214 --> 01:17:33,693
I want a son.

723
01:18:19,461 --> 01:18:21,304
Let Nimrod read it.

724
01:18:21,697 --> 01:18:25,110
Go ahead, his honor.
- Go ahead... go ahead.

725
01:18:54,896 --> 01:18:56,773
You got the bad knife, Rabbi Haim,

726
01:18:57,799 --> 01:19:01,110
Would you like to switch?
- No. As long as the salad is good.

727
01:19:03,105 --> 01:19:04,743
I found a match for you.

728
01:19:08,110 --> 01:19:10,021
It's been on my mind for a while.

729
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:12,959
She's born-again too.

730
01:19:13,148 --> 01:19:15,856
It's good for your
spiritual connection. Hold on.

731
01:19:22,824 --> 01:19:25,100
Thank you, Rabbi Haim.
- I should be thanking you.

732
01:19:25,861 --> 01:19:29,240
He who brings a match together
in Israel has a place in heaven.

733
01:19:29,531 --> 01:19:31,101
Did you know that?

734
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:36,511
Can I get to know her first?
Meet her?

735
01:19:36,872 --> 01:19:39,148
Of course,
that's the way to do it.

736
01:19:40,008 --> 01:19:43,455
But not to doubt and babble.

737
01:19:49,017 --> 01:19:52,897
What would one or two meetings
tell you anyway?

738
01:19:55,924 --> 01:19:57,801
You'd know if she's beautiful.

739
01:20:02,497 --> 01:20:04,101
Well, she is beautiful.

740
01:20:07,936 --> 01:20:10,382
Are you happy to know that?

741
01:20:11,239 --> 01:20:12,309
Yes.

742
01:20:12,808 --> 01:20:13,878
No.

743
01:20:14,075 --> 01:20:15,349
It scares you.

744
01:20:17,512 --> 01:20:18,855
Be happy.

745
01:20:19,481 --> 01:20:21,483
A beautiful woman is a good thing.

746
01:20:25,854 --> 01:20:27,834
Shall we set up a meeting?

747
01:20:28,557 --> 01:20:32,528
No... you're right.
I don't need to see her first.

748
01:20:32,994 --> 01:20:37,272
Alright, but we'll wait, a year.

749
01:20:37,899 --> 01:20:43,247
"And they seemed only a few days
to him" as with Jacob and Rachel.

750
01:20:54,883 --> 01:20:57,454
Get the salad ready
and call the guys, alright?

751
01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:24,117
You're here,
I was about to leave.

752
01:21:24,346 --> 01:21:25,222
I'm here.

753
01:21:29,217 --> 01:21:31,891
How are you?
- Bless the Lord.

754
01:21:32,420 --> 01:21:33,626
Good.

755
01:21:34,322 --> 01:21:35,630
Need anything?

756
01:21:36,157 --> 01:21:39,434
Money? Rent?
- I don't pay any money here.

757
01:21:41,129 --> 01:21:43,609
In the morning I clean the
synagogue instead of money.

758
01:21:49,337 --> 01:21:52,443
I like this place,
it's what I need.

759
01:21:54,175 --> 01:21:55,984
Not bad at all.

760
01:21:56,478 --> 01:22:00,324
At your age, I lived in places
that made this look like a palace.

761
01:22:02,484 --> 01:22:05,158
If it wasn't for your mother,
I would still be a savage.

762
01:22:05,453 --> 01:22:07,023
Leave mom out of this.

763
01:22:29,644 --> 01:22:33,057
Come over.
Come over sometimes.

764
01:22:36,518 --> 01:22:38,930
If the problem is a kosher kitchen,
we'll make a kosher kitchen.

765
01:22:39,087 --> 01:22:40,259
You think it's that simple?

766
01:22:41,056 --> 01:22:43,935
You know how many commandments
you have to learn for a kosher kitchen?

767
01:22:47,362 --> 01:22:50,434
We'll get disposable plates,
we'll order catering.

768
01:22:51,166 --> 01:22:53,203
We'll make do.
- It doesn't work like that.

769
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:59,009
If a non-Jew touches wine,
it's no longer kosher.

770
01:23:01,343 --> 01:23:04,654
If she's there, nothing can be kosher.
- Then don't have wine.

771
01:23:07,282 --> 01:23:08,659
You want me to come,

772
01:23:10,018 --> 01:23:11,361
then she needs to leave.

773
01:25:43,505 --> 01:25:44,779
First time?

774
01:25:45,907 --> 01:25:47,215
Yes.

775
01:25:48,843 --> 01:25:52,347
I thought maybe...
Before you were born again.

776
01:25:53,281 --> 01:25:54,191
No.

777
01:25:55,583 --> 01:25:57,722
And you've been with a man?

778
01:25:58,153 --> 01:25:59,325
I have.

779
01:26:02,924 --> 01:26:05,530
Don't worry, it'll be fine.

780
01:26:35,890 --> 01:26:38,166
We can do it later too.

781
01:26:39,894 --> 01:26:42,374
It's a commandment,
you can't postpone a commandment.

782
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:46,543
Let alone this one.

783
01:26:50,705 --> 01:26:52,946
It's the first commandment
in the Bible.

784
01:26:56,711 --> 01:26:58,281
Should I turn it off?

785
01:27:26,941 --> 01:27:28,682
It's beautiful, I love it.

786
01:27:31,946 --> 01:27:34,688
Everybody's adding levels,
but this house hasn't changed.

787
01:27:35,883 --> 01:27:37,829
Families grow, you have to build.

788
01:27:39,354 --> 01:27:41,766
God Willing, we'll need to build
another story too.

789
01:27:43,758 --> 01:27:46,432
When I was a child, I had a wall
like this by the house.

790
01:27:47,295 --> 01:27:48,968
I'd stand there for hours
with a ball.

791
01:27:49,330 --> 01:27:51,537
Toss it and catch it,
toss and catch.

792
01:27:52,767 --> 01:27:54,678
I don't know how the wall held up.

793
01:27:57,605 --> 01:27:59,983
When we have a child,
he'll play against this wall too.

794
01:28:00,708 --> 01:28:01,982
God Willing.

795
01:28:03,044 --> 01:28:06,389
We have to ask whose shed this is,
if we're allowed to use it.

796
01:28:18,326 --> 01:28:19,464
Are you happy?

797
01:28:20,828 --> 01:28:22,273
Yes.

798
01:28:33,474 --> 01:28:36,284
Excuse me, my ball fell into
your yard, can I get it?

799
01:28:36,444 --> 01:28:37,354
Of course.

800
01:28:41,082 --> 01:28:42,060
Thanks.

801
01:29:29,530 --> 01:29:30,736
Why?

802
01:29:33,634 --> 01:29:35,910
In the Bible, Nimrod rebelled
against the Lord Almighty,

803
01:29:37,138 --> 01:29:40,847
so if I change my name,
it might set me on a new path.

804
01:29:43,478 --> 01:29:44,684
Sit.

805
01:29:50,785 --> 01:29:55,962
The Sages say that Nimrod wore
"Adam's coat of skins",

806
01:29:57,759 --> 01:30:00,000
his great-great-grandfather's.

807
01:30:00,695 --> 01:30:04,006
This coat could not be pierced
by any sword.

808
01:30:04,732 --> 01:30:07,941
Bullets of a gun were like
watermelon seeds to it.

809
01:30:10,037 --> 01:30:15,749
The Sages tell that one day,
Nimrod went out to the field to hunt,

810
01:30:17,478 --> 01:30:19,754
and met the evil Esau there.

811
01:30:22,417 --> 01:30:24,419
Evil meets evil.

812
01:30:25,953 --> 01:30:30,902
Nimrod said to the evil Esau,
that everything in the field was his.

813
01:30:31,092 --> 01:30:34,096
There were savory foods there,
like deer and elk.

814
01:30:35,830 --> 01:30:39,039
But Esau would not give in.
He said, who do you think you are?

815
01:30:40,501 --> 01:30:44,916
So they decided to fight,
winner take all.

816
01:30:47,208 --> 01:30:49,085
But Esau was no fool.

817
01:30:49,677 --> 01:30:52,920
He said to Nimrod,
that's not fair,

818
01:30:53,581 --> 01:30:55,857
let's see you fight
without the coat.

819
01:30:56,584 --> 01:31:00,589
Nimrod, who had the coat his whole
life, thought its strength was his.

820
01:31:00,788 --> 01:31:02,665
He forgot it was all from the coat.

821
01:31:03,991 --> 01:31:07,063
He tossed it aside,
and Esau jumped on the coat.

822
01:31:07,962 --> 01:31:11,671
And with the coat,
it was an unfair fight.

823
01:32:02,283 --> 01:32:04,024
This is your name.

824
01:32:04,952 --> 01:32:07,762
Whoever named you,
named you hard.

825
01:32:07,955 --> 01:32:11,926
But whatever you do with it,
that is up to you.

826
01:32:24,038 --> 01:32:25,779
Why are you looking so miserable?

827
01:32:27,141 --> 01:32:28,779
Did you get your period?
- Yes.

828
01:32:30,845 --> 01:32:32,950
Then say you got it.
Say, I'm not pregnant.

829
01:32:34,582 --> 01:32:35,856
I got it.

830
01:32:36,317 --> 01:32:37,887
So you got it.

831
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:40,797
You got it last month too.

832
01:32:41,689 --> 01:32:46,297
Two months ago, three months ago.
We'll wait as long as it takes.

833
01:32:49,096 --> 01:32:50,234
No.

834
01:32:51,832 --> 01:32:53,106
I want a separation.

835
01:32:54,602 --> 01:32:55,774
Now.

836
01:33:07,114 --> 01:33:08,559
If you hadn't gotten it,

837
01:33:09,951 --> 01:33:12,591
we'd keep going, have dinner,

838
01:33:12,787 --> 01:33:13,925
go to sleep.

839
01:33:14,355 --> 01:33:15,629
We wouldn't be fighting,

840
01:33:15,823 --> 01:33:18,099
You wouldn't have said
that you want a separation.

841
01:33:21,796 --> 01:33:24,072
I would have said it at some point.

842
01:33:24,332 --> 01:33:25,709
When?

843
01:33:25,900 --> 01:33:27,106
Tomorrow.

844
01:33:28,703 --> 01:33:30,205
Then say it tomorrow.

845
01:33:36,310 --> 01:33:39,120
It's hard, being with me?
- That's not the problem,

846
01:33:40,348 --> 01:33:42,828
Sometimes things start out hard,
then they work out.

847
01:33:43,017 --> 01:33:46,089
Why shouldn't things work out
for us in the end?

848
01:33:48,255 --> 01:33:51,896
Because from the first moment,
you've treated me like an enemy.

849
01:33:53,094 --> 01:33:56,007
From the first glance
on the alter.

850
01:34:02,903 --> 01:34:07,010
Yes, it's true.

851
01:34:09,343 --> 01:34:11,619
And why do you think that is?

852
01:34:13,347 --> 01:34:14,758
I don't know.

853
01:34:14,982 --> 01:34:16,791
Tell me. What's my problem?

854
01:34:20,187 --> 01:34:22,633
I believe it's all about the family.

855
01:34:23,324 --> 01:34:25,201
You haven't told me anything,
but I'm sure

856
01:34:25,393 --> 01:34:27,805
that growing up without a mother
means something.

857
01:34:28,029 --> 01:34:30,009
Do you ever listen to yourself?

858
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,707
It's psychology.
There's no such thing.

859
01:34:34,902 --> 01:34:37,382
There is good in the eyes of the Lord
and bad in the eyes of the Lord.

860
01:34:39,940 --> 01:34:41,920
I'll tell you why I didn't
want you from the very start.

861
01:34:42,109 --> 01:34:43,019
Should I say it?

862
01:34:44,345 --> 01:34:45,847
How can someone want a whore?

863
01:34:47,848 --> 01:34:49,725
From the first moment,
I saw who you were.

864
01:34:51,819 --> 01:34:54,095
Don't touch me, I'm on my period,
I'm forbidden!

865
01:35:18,312 --> 01:35:19,723
Hello.

866
01:35:21,882 --> 01:35:23,452
Your father isn't here.

867
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:27,298
Come in.

868
01:35:30,758 --> 01:35:31,964
Will he be back today?

869
01:35:32,193 --> 01:35:34,070
No, he's in Tel Aviv,
at his conference...

870
01:35:36,197 --> 01:35:38,040
Come here...

871
01:35:43,304 --> 01:35:44,476
Where's my dog?

872
01:35:47,341 --> 01:35:49,719
He couldn't hear, couldn't see.

873
01:35:50,144 --> 01:35:52,181
We had to put him to sleep.

874
01:35:56,350 --> 01:36:00,389
Come, let me give you some food.
Just a bit.

875
01:36:40,261 --> 01:36:44,767
Eat, no one's watching.

876
01:37:38,953 --> 01:37:40,523
My child...

877
01:38:31,372 --> 01:38:33,147
An old lion...

878
01:38:33,641 --> 01:38:35,917
what does he feels
right before the end?

879
01:38:36,510 --> 01:38:37,921
Surprise?

880
01:38:38,445 --> 01:38:41,289
Because the end,
though inevitable,

881
01:38:41,482 --> 01:38:43,223
must also be a surprise.

882
01:38:44,218 --> 01:38:46,960
Is that it?
Is it over?

883
01:38:47,554 --> 01:38:50,160
And then, the summaries.

884
01:38:51,191 --> 01:38:52,636
What did I get done?

885
01:38:52,993 --> 01:38:54,529
What did I never get to?

886
01:38:55,329 --> 01:38:56,933
What was true?

887
01:38:58,065 --> 01:38:59,339
What was a lie?

888
01:39:00,334 --> 01:39:01,312
No...

889
01:39:03,304 --> 01:39:05,477
My wife is pregnant...
Let me go to her...

890
01:39:06,473 --> 01:39:07,508
No...

891
01:39:45,512 --> 01:39:48,516
Take a right and then a left...

892
01:40:04,999 --> 01:40:06,342
Cancel the contract.

893
01:40:06,767 --> 01:40:09,145
I'll go to my Rabbi,
you'll be disgraced.

894
01:40:09,670 --> 01:40:12,617
No Jew will talk to you.
Cancel this contract!

895
01:40:16,010 --> 01:40:17,580
You've got a place
in heaven, anyway.

896
01:40:17,778 --> 01:40:19,985
It's mine, he gave it to me.

897
01:40:20,147 --> 01:40:22,354
You got a place in heaven,
so why?

898
01:40:23,283 --> 01:40:28,289
Dad... dad... daddy...

899
01:41:07,161 --> 01:41:11,507
Blessed are you, Our Lord,
King of the Universe,

900
01:41:12,766 --> 01:41:15,144
By whose Word everything
comes to be. -Amen.

901
01:41:29,616 --> 01:41:31,391
Your father.

902
01:41:34,354 --> 01:41:36,425
If you love him this much...

903
01:41:37,491 --> 01:41:38,834
It's good...

904
01:41:43,464 --> 01:41:49,642
I have no children, you see?

905
01:42:28,642 --> 01:42:30,144
Tea?

906
01:42:37,551 --> 01:42:39,690
When I was a child
I'd face this window

907
01:42:43,524 --> 01:42:46,664
and stare for hours
at the buildings, the sky.

908
01:42:49,596 --> 01:42:54,545
I was interested to see what people
were doing inside their houses.

909
01:42:58,705 --> 01:43:02,448
Nimrodi, your friends
from the Yeshiva are here.

910
01:43:05,412 --> 01:43:07,255
One minute, okay?

911
01:43:11,418 --> 01:43:13,159
Drink your tea.

912
01:43:13,320 --> 01:43:14,458
It'll get cold.

913
01:43:23,297 --> 01:43:24,537
I'm sorry.

914
01:43:38,645 --> 01:43:39,885
Peace be upon you.

915
01:43:40,280 --> 01:43:41,281
Upon you too.

916
01:43:41,481 --> 01:43:42,960
Where is the master?
- Here.

917
01:43:46,286 --> 01:43:47,697
Master.

918
01:43:50,657 --> 01:43:53,331
There you go, Rabbi Simcha,
give it to the cats, alright?

919
01:43:53,727 --> 01:43:55,934
It's good against the mice.

920
01:43:57,664 --> 01:43:58,904
You can carry it all?

921
01:44:00,667 --> 01:44:02,738
All the best. - All the best.
What can I get you, Rabbi Daniel?

922
01:45:00,427 --> 01:45:03,340
Hold up, hold up.

923
01:45:05,365 --> 01:45:06,776
Let us walk together.

924
01:45:10,971 --> 01:45:12,712
It's better this way.

925
01:45:14,741 --> 01:45:16,049
Let's walk.

926
01:45:20,414 --> 01:45:23,987
Say, what did you have
to fear of the next world?

927
01:45:24,918 --> 01:45:26,420
It's a long story.

928
01:45:26,620 --> 01:45:28,622
Have we got time?

929
01:45:28,822 --> 01:45:30,768
Looks like we'll
be there in just a bit.

930
01:45:30,957 --> 01:45:31,958
Let's start.

931
01:45:32,326 --> 01:45:34,932
If there's time, fine.
If not, that's alright too.

932
01:45:37,464 --> 01:45:42,345
In Poland, during the war,
right when the Nazis came

933
01:45:42,536 --> 01:45:45,517
the Polish seized the opportunity.

934
01:45:46,106 --> 01:45:48,347
Two of them came into our house.

935
01:45:48,575 --> 01:45:51,522
I knew one from the streets,
the other was a blond man.

936
01:45:52,446 --> 01:45:57,919
My father and I
hide under our beds.

937
01:45:59,486 --> 01:46:03,332
In a minute or two,
they took everything.

938
01:46:05,459 --> 01:46:07,439
The menorah,
candlesticks, everything.

939
01:46:08,662 --> 01:46:10,505
Put it all in a sack.

940
01:46:10,797 --> 01:46:13,437
Suddenly, I had to sneeze.

941
01:46:14,634 --> 01:46:19,549
I held it in, held it in hard.

942
01:46:19,806 --> 01:46:23,015
The Polish men were already
on their way out...

943
01:46:23,410 --> 01:46:25,788
But the sneeze came out first.
A big, loud one.

944
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:28,050
The Polish men stopped,

945
01:46:28,448 --> 01:46:31,395
they looked at each other
and ran back in.

946
01:46:32,119 --> 01:46:34,725
And then my dad,
the big hero,

947
01:46:34,988 --> 01:46:38,458
came out, wiping his nose,
as if it was him.

948
01:46:39,793 --> 01:46:41,670
The Polish men grabbed him.

949
01:46:41,862 --> 01:46:45,810
One held him, the other held a knife,
and they cut his eyes out.

950
01:46:46,967 --> 01:46:50,414
My dad was screaming,
and they were laughing.

951
01:46:54,941 --> 01:46:56,750
He had a high-pitched voice.

952
01:46:57,477 --> 01:46:59,582
I was already a big boy,
as tall as I am now.

953
01:46:59,780 --> 01:47:02,090
I could have helped him,
but I didn't.

954
01:47:03,150 --> 01:47:04,720
I didn't move.

955
01:47:05,986 --> 01:47:09,433
That's it.
So when my day will come.

956
01:47:09,923 --> 01:47:11,664
Will come? It has come.

957
01:47:12,459 --> 01:47:15,030
In a few moments
we'll be facing heaven's gate.

958
01:47:16,530 --> 01:47:19,636
If I'm let into heaven, all is well.

959
01:47:19,866 --> 01:47:24,611
If I'm sent to hell,
I'll show him the contract. Here!

960
01:47:29,676 --> 01:47:31,747
We could use a breeze.

961
01:47:44,124 --> 01:47:45,865
Are you worried?

962
01:47:47,761 --> 01:47:49,900
You have nothing to worry about.

963
01:47:50,497 --> 01:47:52,443
What is the next world?

964
01:47:52,599 --> 01:47:54,044
It's your children.

965
01:47:54,234 --> 01:47:58,580
If you have a good son,
you have a place in heaven.

966
01:48:04,478 --> 01:48:05,752
Shall we?

967
01:48:12,118 --> 01:48:14,487
And your story, what about it?

968
01:48:14,488 --> 01:48:14,966
And your story, what about it?

969
01:48:23,964 --> 01:48:30,882
For my father
