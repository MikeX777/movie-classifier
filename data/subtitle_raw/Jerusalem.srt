1
00:00:07,794 --> 00:00:13,790
Towards the end of the 19th century,
Christians from around the world...

2
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:19,462
emigrated to Jerusalem, convinced
the end of the world was nigh...

3
00:00:19,566 --> 00:00:23,319
and the second coming of Christ
was eminent.

4
00:00:23,409 --> 00:00:26,216
This story is dedicated to them.

5
00:00:46,539 --> 00:00:48,754
Mr. Storm!

6
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:53,975
What a surprise! Welcome!

7
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:59,400
How are the children getting on in
school? Are they learning anything?

8
00:00:59,571 --> 00:01:04,133
-Indeed...
-I thought so.

9
00:01:04,303 --> 00:01:08,191
What brings you here,
if I may ask?

10
00:01:08,353 --> 00:01:12,150
Well... it's like this...

11
00:01:12,422 --> 00:01:15,367
-It's so...
-What is it, Storm?

12
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:18,749
I have something to tell you.
I'll tell the vicar...

13
00:01:18,839 --> 00:01:22,865
Some of us plan to build a...

14
00:01:24,332 --> 00:01:26,352
A mission-hall.

15
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,420
A mission-hall? Surely not.

16
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:34,355
Building a mission-hall?

17
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:43,072
Heresies are spreading
throughout the land.

18
00:01:43,339 --> 00:01:47,727
-I thought you were my friend.
-Don't take it like that.

19
00:01:47,889 --> 00:01:53,640
I've not been an eminent preacher,
but to take the office from me...!

20
00:01:53,904 --> 00:01:58,147
The mission-hall will be
a fortress against apostasy...

21
00:01:58,315 --> 00:02:02,722
and the sects that threaten our land
with conversion and desolation.

22
00:02:02,886 --> 00:02:04,246
Forget all that...

23
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:10,624
The mission hall shall be a place where
people can be addressed more directly.

24
00:02:10,786 --> 00:02:16,271
-Where you can explain the difficult...
-Haven't I spread knowledge?

25
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:20,237
Haven't I warned
against unbelief?

26
00:02:20,409 --> 00:02:24,149
I must be singularly inept
when the school teacher...

27
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,936
a farmer,
I have taught you everything!

28
00:02:27,026 --> 00:02:30,230
And now you think
you are on a pair with me.

29
00:02:34,644 --> 00:02:38,089
We have to protect the flock
against the wolves.

30
00:02:39,296 --> 00:02:42,159
Wolves?
I haven't seen any wolves.

31
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:45,607
I know they are on their way.

32
00:02:48,398 --> 00:02:52,346
If so, is it you, Storm,
who opens the door to them.

33
00:03:57,788 --> 00:04:02,276
Ingmar! Big-lngmar!

34
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:09,054
The jetty has collapsed!
The children are on it!

35
00:04:50,077 --> 00:04:54,345
No! Don't go into the water!

36
00:04:54,608 --> 00:05:00,154
-It'll be the death for you!
-Come back, lngmar!

37
00:05:00,322 --> 00:05:02,762
Ingmar!

38
00:05:02,929 --> 00:05:07,390
Big-lngmar! Come back!

39
00:05:16,803 --> 00:05:21,125
Ingmar!
It'll be the death for you!

40
00:05:22,176 --> 00:05:25,175
You're crazy, lngmar!

41
00:05:28,271 --> 00:05:31,429
Come on, children!

42
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:51,118
lngmar!
Look out for the log!

43
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:15,503
You must take me home.
Take me back to the farm.

44
00:06:15,907 --> 00:06:20,227
-You won't make it. It's too far.
-I want to see lngmar.

45
00:06:22,819 --> 00:06:24,807
I must talk to my boy.

46
00:06:28,358 --> 00:06:32,478
And the angel took John
to the top of a high mountain.

47
00:06:32,568 --> 00:06:37,573
and showed him the holy city,
The new Jerusalem,

48
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:39,825
descended from heaven,

49
00:06:39,987 --> 00:06:44,229
from God,
filled with God's whole glory.

50
00:06:44,397 --> 00:06:49,278
And John saw how the city shone...

51
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:55,553
like the most precious jewel.
The city wall was of quartz.

52
00:07:08,316 --> 00:07:09,982
It's good that you came.

53
00:07:14,671 --> 00:07:19,380
Come closer to the light, children,
that I may see you...

54
00:07:25,217 --> 00:07:31,550
After your mother's death, I thought
that I would live long enough

55
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:36,334
so both of you could fend for yourself.
But...

56
00:07:41,547 --> 00:07:42,626
Karin...

57
00:07:43,993 --> 00:07:49,183
In this envelope
is all the money I own.

58
00:07:49,848 --> 00:07:51,827
It's for lngmar.

59
00:07:53,597 --> 00:07:57,522
I want you to keep them
until the boy has grown up.

60
00:07:59,591 --> 00:08:01,071
Yes, father.

61
00:08:05,165 --> 00:08:09,910
And you and your husband...
If he can stay sober...

62
00:08:11,581 --> 00:08:18,476
shall run the farm
until lngmar is old enough...

63
00:08:18,738 --> 00:08:22,216
to buy it back from you
with that money.

64
00:08:23,089 --> 00:08:24,871
Yes, father.

65
00:08:27,981 --> 00:08:32,281
Ingmar, my darling boy...

66
00:08:34,357 --> 00:08:38,858
The people in this parish
have always needed someone

67
00:08:38,948 --> 00:08:43,718
who can lead and support them.
That's what they are used to.

68
00:08:46,687 --> 00:08:52,554
When you are a grown man, it will
be your turn. Do you understand?

69
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,180
Remember, lngmar...

70
00:09:02,546 --> 00:09:08,128
One day the people here
will need you.

71
00:09:10,485 --> 00:09:14,043
Promise me
never to let them down.

72
00:09:56,438 --> 00:10:01,204
If the boy doesn't like it
he can go to hell!

73
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,650
Go to hell both of you!

74
00:10:03,816 --> 00:10:07,242
I make the decisions
'round here now!

75
00:10:48,886 --> 00:10:51,669
-Karin!
-Good day, Karin.

76
00:10:53,036 --> 00:10:55,112
-Good day, lngmar.
-Good day, Storm.

77
00:10:55,202 --> 00:10:58,364
Well, you know how things are...

78
00:10:59,332 --> 00:11:04,319
-Yes, we do.
-Well, things have gotten much worse.

79
00:11:04,685 --> 00:11:07,289
I don't want my brother to suffer.

80
00:11:08,003 --> 00:11:10,408
So I'd like to ask you...

81
00:11:11,372 --> 00:11:15,753
if he can live here with you
until things are better at home.

82
00:11:18,449 --> 00:11:22,716
-Of course, but we are not well off...
-I'm sorry to ask...

83
00:11:23,381 --> 00:11:27,304
Of course lngmar shall live here!

84
00:11:27,471 --> 00:11:31,290
I can't imagine
a better place than here.

85
00:11:31,381 --> 00:11:34,605
It is an honor
to help an lngmarsson.

86
00:11:34,769 --> 00:11:38,530
I'll bring his things over.
Thank you very much!

87
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:41,826
Farewell, lngmar.

88
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:23,173
May I have it back?

89
00:12:24,314 --> 00:12:30,768
-Eljas! Give it to me!
-It's useless!

90
00:13:10,728 --> 00:13:13,793
Elias! Elias!

91
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:19,467
What have you done with lngmars money?
Come down at once.

92
00:13:21,995 --> 00:13:24,561
Do you hear me?
Come down!

93
00:13:27,289 --> 00:13:29,410
Come down at once!

94
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:18,071
Elias?

95
00:14:22,364 --> 00:14:25,926
What have done with the envelope
containing lngmar's money?

96
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:35,967
When you shouted...

97
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:42,125
it was as though your father
came rushing towards me.

98
00:16:01,246 --> 00:16:02,665
Hello, lngmar.

99
00:16:05,277 --> 00:16:09,500
You know that Tim and I are
very happy with each other.

100
00:16:10,462 --> 00:16:11,727
So now...

101
00:16:14,297 --> 00:16:17,342
we've decided
to get married in the autumn.

102
00:16:17,846 --> 00:16:20,758
Therefore we'd like to ask you

103
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:24,262
if you wish to return to
the farm to live with us?

104
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:44,151
-Come and dance, lngmar!
-I can't.

105
00:17:44,318 --> 00:17:50,719
Come on now!
One, two, three, one, two, three...

106
00:17:53,087 --> 00:17:57,609
-No, I can't do it.
-Sure you can! You're so boring.

107
00:17:57,773 --> 00:18:02,933
-Mom can dance with me!
-I'm too old for that for such things!

108
00:18:19,597 --> 00:18:23,452
-May I go to the dance?
-You'd be back too late.

109
00:18:23,542 --> 00:18:28,379
-But everyone else goes!
-Very well, if Ingmar goes with you.

110
00:18:30,449 --> 00:18:35,474
-But I haven't planned to go.
-Why must you always be so boring?

111
00:18:42,503 --> 00:18:44,293
Well, then I'll go.

112
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:18,631
What is it, mother?

113
00:19:18,794 --> 00:19:22,632
-What is it?
-Look yourself.

114
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:37,684
Ingmar is practicing
for the party.

115
00:23:05,808 --> 00:23:09,072
Don't worry Gertrud.
It will soon be over.

116
00:23:13,257 --> 00:23:17,053
May God have mercy on us.
Oh Lord. We meant no harm.

117
00:24:35,189 --> 00:24:36,803
Karin!

118
00:24:40,275 --> 00:24:41,733
Karin!

119
00:24:46,081 --> 00:24:50,043
Karin! Karin!

120
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:32,753
Tim! Tim!

121
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,598
Tim!

122
00:25:40,863 --> 00:25:44,077
-I can't go any more!
-What happened?

123
00:25:44,347 --> 00:25:49,271
My legs don't carry me.
I think I'm paralyzed.

124
00:25:51,735 --> 00:25:55,692
Tim...
is God punishing us?

125
00:27:19,212 --> 00:27:21,013
What is it, lngmar?

126
00:27:22,076 --> 00:27:24,631
I must keep what I promised dad.

127
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,053
What do you mean?

128
00:27:28,823 --> 00:27:31,066
I must work and earn money...

129
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:34,423
so the farm
can be mine as planned.

130
00:27:40,236 --> 00:27:43,998
I'll try to get the sawmill
in the forest working again.

131
00:28:29,972 --> 00:28:33,286
-Hello Gertrude! How are you?
-Good, thanks.

132
00:28:33,456 --> 00:28:36,451
-How cold it has become.
-Yes...

133
00:28:39,262 --> 00:28:42,741
-Have you heard from lngmar?
-Not a word.

134
00:28:43,107 --> 00:28:47,622
Ingmar isn't one to write letters, but
if you want we can get a word to him.

135
00:28:48,092 --> 00:28:49,462
Yes, thank you.

136
00:28:53,438 --> 00:28:55,432
Amen.

137
00:28:55,801 --> 00:29:01,125
And finally, we will sing
"Jerusalem, thou exalted city".

138
00:29:01,487 --> 00:29:05,822
Excuse me...
May I say a few words?

139
00:29:06,593 --> 00:29:09,146
Well... if it can't wait?

140
00:29:09,336 --> 00:29:13,653
I would like to tell you
and the congregation...

141
00:29:13,843 --> 00:29:16,471
about the storm last summer,
when...

142
00:29:16,561 --> 00:29:20,128
we all stayed home
and feared for out lives.

143
00:29:20,518 --> 00:29:25,179
We longed to come to the mission-
hall and hear word of God...

144
00:29:25,544 --> 00:29:28,924
but we couldn't go out
because of the weather.

145
00:29:29,088 --> 00:29:34,027
Then the spirit came over me
and began to speak.

146
00:29:34,394 --> 00:29:36,995
I thought it was strange...

147
00:29:37,457 --> 00:29:42,396
that a simple man like me should be
given the ability to speak like that.

148
00:29:42,763 --> 00:29:47,406
But then I thought although
you are a schoolmaster...

149
00:29:47,672 --> 00:29:50,601
you are but a farmer yourself...

150
00:29:50,772 --> 00:29:56,249
I see... So you wanted to talk
here tonight, Mats Hök?

151
00:29:56,339 --> 00:30:01,963
-Yes, if you nobody objects...
-No, we've finished for today.

152
00:30:02,125 --> 00:30:07,950
-May I not say a few words?
-No, now we sing the hymn.

153
00:30:12,285 --> 00:30:13,619
Mr. Storm!

154
00:30:15,306 --> 00:30:16,733
Mr. Storm!

155
00:30:16,823 --> 00:30:21,236
I think you should ask for our opinion
before silencing Mats Hök.

156
00:30:21,407 --> 00:30:24,562
Is that what you think, my lad?

157
00:30:24,931 --> 00:30:30,270
Let me tell you that I am the only one
who has something to say here.

158
00:30:31,738 --> 00:30:36,021
I heard Mats Hök
preach that night...

159
00:30:36,183 --> 00:30:38,185
It was magnificent.

160
00:30:38,475 --> 00:30:42,710
Everyone here would
enjoy hearing it.

161
00:30:42,871 --> 00:30:46,954
If I let Mats Hök preach tonight...

162
00:30:47,116 --> 00:30:51,911
you'll want to preach next Sunday,
and then Tim will want to go!

163
00:30:52,081 --> 00:30:58,767
Why shouldn't Mats or anyone else
be entitled to preach as you do?

164
00:30:58,929 --> 00:31:03,132
I have a suggestion...

165
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:09,257
Donors of money to build the
mission-hall should be asked first.

166
00:31:09,421 --> 00:31:13,703
When we built this mission-hall...

167
00:31:13,866 --> 00:31:16,319
we agreed it would be free for all.

168
00:31:16,409 --> 00:31:20,592
Not like a church, where only
one man may proclaim God's word.

169
00:31:39,374 --> 00:31:43,073
Here is the key to this building.

170
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,287
I hereby part with it.

171
00:31:46,377 --> 00:31:52,626
I have finally understood that
everything I wanted to keep out...

172
00:31:53,003 --> 00:31:55,784
I have instead let in.

173
00:32:30,278 --> 00:32:34,584
May I ask how long you're
planning to stay, sir?

174
00:32:35,585 --> 00:32:40,051
I have yet to decide,
but I expect to remain for some time.

175
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:45,997
Well, here it is.
I hope you will find it suitable.

176
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:51,824
Perhaps I should show you around,
if you're new to this parts?

177
00:32:52,123 --> 00:32:56,629
Thank you, but as a young man
I worked nearby.

178
00:32:56,828 --> 00:33:00,253
-In that case...
-By the way...

179
00:33:01,842 --> 00:33:06,031
Old lngmar died in an accident
down by the river years ago.

180
00:33:06,236 --> 00:33:12,936
It was tragic. He was a great man!
It was a misfortune for the district.

181
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:19,475
-Who has taken over his farm?
-His daughter and her husband.

182
00:33:20,726 --> 00:33:24,780
-Did he not have a son?
-He's also called Ingmar, of course.

183
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:30,272
He is as resolute as his father.

184
00:33:30,362 --> 00:33:34,109
But now he's obliged to
slave away in the forest.

185
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:39,127
-I see.
-Do you want to get hold of him?

186
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:42,988
His fiancé
lives down by the school.

187
00:33:43,175 --> 00:33:46,410
That won't be necessary.
Thanks anyway.

188
00:33:46,744 --> 00:33:51,871
-Would you like some supper?
-I am tired after my travels.

189
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,522
Goodnight.

190
00:34:40,873 --> 00:34:42,613
Dear lngmar...

191
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:47,140
I think of you. How are you coping
up there in the forest?

192
00:34:47,344 --> 00:34:53,075
Have you got the sawmill working?
I guess you're working all the time.

193
00:34:53,439 --> 00:34:57,365
Your father would be proud
if he could see you.

194
00:34:59,005 --> 00:35:01,360
Things are much the same...

195
00:35:01,751 --> 00:35:05,933
except that Father is upset after
the quarrel in the mission-hall.

196
00:35:06,133 --> 00:35:08,695
There is a newcomer here.

197
00:35:08,897 --> 00:35:12,670
A preacher from the United States.

198
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:15,888
It must be cold where you are.

199
00:35:16,089 --> 00:35:20,631
I wish I cold warm your hands
and look after you.

200
00:35:20,735 --> 00:35:23,685
I wish we could be together
all the time.

201
00:35:26,047 --> 00:35:28,590
You have no idea how I miss you.

202
00:35:29,051 --> 00:35:33,519
Every day I come to this stone
and pretend you are with me.

203
00:35:36,481 --> 00:35:41,393
It's been such a long time.
It all seems so unreal:

204
00:35:41,773 --> 00:35:44,449
The dance and the storm...

205
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:52,303
I would be so glad to hear from you
and to know if you think of me.

206
00:35:53,995 --> 00:35:57,343
You have no idea how I miss you.
It's so dull without you.

207
00:35:57,525 --> 00:35:59,209
Why don't you write?

208
00:35:59,309 --> 00:36:03,775
I feel sad and angry.
It's because I miss you.

209
00:36:03,967 --> 00:36:08,063
What does it matter?
You'll never get this letter anyway.

210
00:36:19,417 --> 00:36:23,274
Satan doesn't wear horns
so you can recognize him.

211
00:36:23,771 --> 00:36:26,350
Satan is among us!

212
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:30,171
We must turn our back on all
who would tempt us to sin.

213
00:36:30,852 --> 00:36:33,248
-What's your name?
-Gunhild.

214
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:37,432
Come ahead.
I want to talk to you, Gunhild...

215
00:36:39,258 --> 00:36:41,020
May I ask you...

216
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:45,070
When you dressed up like that
to visit the house of God...

217
00:36:45,271 --> 00:36:48,641
was it for the Lord's sake,
or your own?

218
00:36:48,745 --> 00:36:54,442
-I just wanted to look nice.
-The Devil's deludes the weak.

219
00:36:54,643 --> 00:36:58,200
Gunhild,
that is the root of all evil.

220
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:03,309
Adornment means temptation
and destruction.

221
00:37:03,414 --> 00:37:07,619
We must deny everything
that leads us away from God.

222
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:11,945
Fleshly desires are sin.
The wages of sin is death.

223
00:37:12,625 --> 00:37:16,654
But God's gift is everlasting life.

224
00:37:19,458 --> 00:37:24,006
-Oh Lord help us.
-May the Lord have mercy upon me.

225
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:28,296
Deliver me from evil...

226
00:37:30,099 --> 00:37:34,684
for thine is the kingdom,
the power and the glory...

227
00:37:34,785 --> 00:37:37,708
for ever and ever.
Amen.

228
00:37:38,178 --> 00:37:42,562
Open your heart.
God shall hear your prayer.

229
00:37:42,754 --> 00:37:46,312
Listen when God speaks. Listen...

230
00:37:46,453 --> 00:37:50,031
God has heard your prayer, my child.
Stand up

231
00:37:50,121 --> 00:37:54,191
No, that's enough.

232
00:37:56,113 --> 00:38:00,820
We're leaving.
He's a false prophet.

233
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:06,378
Christ said: "He that loveth
father or mother more than me"...

234
00:38:06,478 --> 00:38:08,938
"is not worthy of me."

235
00:38:09,723 --> 00:38:13,459
"And ye shall be hated of all men
for my name's sake."

236
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:18,315
"But he that endureth to the end
shall be saved."

237
00:38:19,042 --> 00:38:22,858
"The kingdom of God is nigh.
The Lord shall return."

238
00:38:22,948 --> 00:38:27,433
"He shall judge both living and dead.
He shall punish the evil."

239
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:33,039
But those who are saved
shall know the splendor of Heaven.

240
00:38:34,543 --> 00:38:38,441
All of you gathered here today
shall follow me.

241
00:38:38,928 --> 00:38:41,756
For God has sent me to help you.

242
00:38:42,785 --> 00:38:45,386
I shall help you to salvation.

243
00:39:12,952 --> 00:39:15,668
-Can I help you?
-What?

244
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:23,206
You can hold that
so I can the shaft in.

245
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:30,426
My wife says you have begun
preaching in our mission-hall.

246
00:39:30,787 --> 00:39:32,448
God sent me.

247
00:39:32,895 --> 00:39:37,195
-All the way from America?
-God moves in mysterious ways.

248
00:39:40,195 --> 00:39:45,416
Let me explain. When I got to
America, I bought a factory.

249
00:39:45,786 --> 00:39:48,930
I got on well with my workers...

250
00:39:49,331 --> 00:39:53,981
but they were envious and
accused me of deceit and theft.

251
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:59,143
I ended up in prison and
spent a long time there:

252
00:40:00,445 --> 00:40:04,289
I was an innocent man, wrongly
convicted, yet I enjoyed it...

253
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:09,217
for there I could live
a life of righteousness in solitude.

254
00:40:10,565 --> 00:40:15,124
For the first time I attained
utter closeness to God.

255
00:40:15,924 --> 00:40:19,128
When I gained my freedom again...

256
00:40:19,317 --> 00:40:24,083
I resolved to combat the evil forces
that ruin men on earth.

257
00:40:24,798 --> 00:40:29,926
I joined a lady named Mrs. Gordon
to live a Christian, righteous life.

258
00:40:30,896 --> 00:40:35,766
Soon another joined us and another.
Things went better and better.

259
00:40:35,865 --> 00:40:39,640
Thirty of us now live
in a house in Chicago.

260
00:40:39,844 --> 00:40:44,398
We share everything,
help and watch over each other...

261
00:40:44,596 --> 00:40:47,793
relating in a purely Christian manner.
Tim...

262
00:40:50,092 --> 00:40:53,977
In the short time I've been here I've
heard so many good things about you.

263
00:40:55,063 --> 00:40:57,787
I've heard of your difficulties...

264
00:40:57,877 --> 00:41:02,130
and what a burden it has been
to run the farm on your own.

265
00:41:02,911 --> 00:41:07,895
But if you want to achieve something
great, you need to join with others.

266
00:41:09,903 --> 00:41:15,127
Every day...
Every day, Tim, I hear God's voice.

267
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:18,540
He says to me:
'' Soon...

268
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:23,998
''Soon we shall build a new
Jerusalem... together!''

269
00:42:00,521 --> 00:42:05,458
-I thought I might be able to help.
-We haven't asked for any help.

270
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:11,845
-I gather you are ill.
-I have not walked for six months.

271
00:42:14,854 --> 00:42:17,198
I have come to pray for you.

272
00:42:18,184 --> 00:42:23,320
You might have heard that I can
heal those who have faith in me.

273
00:42:23,819 --> 00:42:28,357
-I have the faith that my father had.
-I'm sure that God can help you.

274
00:42:28,461 --> 00:42:33,077
You have always tried to live in
righteousness. Let me pray for you.

275
00:42:33,848 --> 00:42:36,413
Let God manifest his greatness.

276
00:42:45,307 --> 00:42:49,917
O Lord Jesus. Here is...

277
00:42:50,553 --> 00:42:53,605
Do not spurn what God hath sent.

278
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:59,135
A great mercy
shall be visited upon this house.

279
00:43:39,472 --> 00:43:41,921
Greta! Come here!

280
00:43:45,943 --> 00:43:48,650
Don't go there, Greta.
Come here!

281
00:43:49,236 --> 00:43:50,634
Greta!

282
00:43:52,425 --> 00:43:54,563
Help me, God!

283
00:43:58,298 --> 00:43:59,870
Help me!.

284
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:05,376
Help me...

285
00:44:06,445 --> 00:44:08,608
Help me, dear God.

286
00:44:22,756 --> 00:44:25,045
No! Greta!

287
00:44:32,746 --> 00:44:34,510
Greta!

288
00:44:50,125 --> 00:44:51,788
Thank you, God!

289
00:44:52,843 --> 00:44:58,900
Thank you for sending this holy man
of God to help me.

290
00:45:00,432 --> 00:45:03,707
I thank you
from the bottom of my heart.

291
00:47:05,975 --> 00:47:12,484
Some of the children at school have
begun to preach Hellgum's doctrine!

292
00:47:12,984 --> 00:47:18,426
Hellgum has told them to serve God
rather than play.

293
00:47:18,731 --> 00:47:23,237
They are to convert everyone
and struggle against the devil.

294
00:47:23,823 --> 00:47:30,550
If I contradict them they say:
"How long will you remain sinful?"

295
00:47:32,005 --> 00:47:36,152
Worst of all, some of them
have left their parents...

296
00:47:36,836 --> 00:47:42,214
-and joined Hellgum's group at the
lngmarsson farm. -At the farm...?

297
00:47:42,503 --> 00:47:47,337
Hellgum has founded a community there.
They call themselves Hellgumians.

298
00:47:47,427 --> 00:47:53,478
-What about Karin and Tim?
-They are among the most fervent.

299
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:56,741
Hellgum has torn families apart.

300
00:47:56,831 --> 00:48:01,162
It's brother against sister, friend
against friend, man against wife.

301
00:48:01,361 --> 00:48:04,114
Those belonging to his faith...

302
00:48:04,216 --> 00:48:10,649
cannot live among sinners and devils,
and the hounds of and Antichrists.

303
00:48:10,947 --> 00:48:15,211
-What do you want us to do?
-Well...

304
00:48:16,548 --> 00:48:23,044
People in this parish
have always had a leader.

305
00:48:24,754 --> 00:48:28,580
Now that your father is gone
and... I...

306
00:48:29,878 --> 00:48:32,177
I have lost my influence...

307
00:48:33,374 --> 00:48:36,565
Hellgum has aquired
a hideous power.

308
00:48:39,477 --> 00:48:43,896
Now is the time for you to show
that you are an lngmarsson.

309
00:48:50,013 --> 00:48:52,987
Hellgum has even
talked to Gertrud.

310
00:48:55,235 --> 00:48:58,406
Gertrud would never
let herself be converted.

311
00:48:58,710 --> 00:49:02,473
Well...
I don't know...

312
00:49:21,503 --> 00:49:25,828
lngmar!
Dearest lngmar!

313
00:49:27,470 --> 00:49:30,476
-Welcome, lngmar!
-It's been a long time.

314
00:49:32,294 --> 00:49:35,386
Is there somewhere
we can speak privately?

315
00:49:37,451 --> 00:49:40,359
It's lovely to see you again.

316
00:49:41,606 --> 00:49:45,222
We've waited for you
to come and share our joy.

317
00:49:45,325 --> 00:49:48,805
-What are these people doing here?
-Father would be glad to see...

318
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:52,493
the new Jerusalem
come down from heaven.

319
00:49:52,595 --> 00:49:57,109
-Father wanted us to tread God's path.
-But not Hellgum's path.

320
00:49:57,975 --> 00:50:04,884
Hellgum saved Greta's life by
healing me so I could walk again.

321
00:50:04,974 --> 00:50:09,297
I remember the doctor said
you would walk again...

322
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:13,756
-once the shock had passed.
-Wait until you meet Hellgum.

323
00:50:14,623 --> 00:50:18,870
Wait until you meet Hellgum.
You will join our faith, Ingmar.

324
00:50:20,947 --> 00:50:24,229
I hear you are at odds
with the whole parish.

325
00:50:25,475 --> 00:50:30,395
-We avoid those who tempt us to sin.
-What about me?

326
00:50:30,873 --> 00:50:36,278
You shall follow our faith.
Hellgum will convert you.

327
00:50:36,381 --> 00:50:41,472
I see. Unless I convert to your faith
I cannot live in this house?

328
00:50:44,130 --> 00:50:48,350
There's another matter...
what about the sawmill?

329
00:50:49,424 --> 00:50:54,600
-It's the only way I can earn money.
-We love you so much, Ingmar.

330
00:50:54,704 --> 00:50:57,425
-What about the sawmill?
-Talk to Hellgum.

331
00:50:57,529 --> 00:51:01,702
-I'll certainly talk with him.
-It's for your own good, Ingmar.

332
00:51:02,853 --> 00:51:06,047
Maybe you and Hellgum
could be partners?

333
00:51:10,116 --> 00:51:14,161
Tim?
You have said nothing all this time.

334
00:51:15,789 --> 00:51:19,763
I'm asking you directly:
Is Hellgum to have the sawmill?

335
00:51:22,713 --> 00:51:26,151
How you become such a coward
that you cannot answer?

336
00:51:29,441 --> 00:51:33,240
If you oppose God,
Hellgum shall have it.

337
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:38,992
Thank you.
So that is my incentive to join you!

338
00:51:39,094 --> 00:51:43,751
-He didn't mean it like that.
-I know what he meant:

339
00:51:44,141 --> 00:51:48,919
If I don't convert to your faith,
will I lose my home and the sawmill.

340
00:51:49,122 --> 00:51:51,457
Speak to Hellgum first.

341
00:51:52,093 --> 00:51:54,584
-Where is he?
-With Gertrud.

342
00:51:54,976 --> 00:51:58,015
She could decide tonight
to join us.

343
00:52:29,289 --> 00:52:32,885
Ingmar, is that you?
You're back!

344
00:52:34,059 --> 00:52:35,298
Gertrud...

345
00:52:40,163 --> 00:52:44,452
-It's been a long time.
-Yes it's been a long time.

346
00:52:46,504 --> 00:52:49,281
I never thought I'd see you again.

347
00:52:56,221 --> 00:52:59,333
-How has it been for you up there?
-All right.

348
00:53:00,994 --> 00:53:04,941
I've been working a lot,
but it's been all right.

349
00:53:05,848 --> 00:53:07,276
How are you?

350
00:53:08,686 --> 00:53:13,593
I'm also all right.
The winter has been long.

351
00:53:16,970 --> 00:53:21,739
My sister says you plan
to join the Hellgumians tonight.

352
00:53:22,413 --> 00:53:24,233
Is it true, Gertrud?

353
00:53:28,166 --> 00:53:32,584
-Yes, it's true.
-You mustn't do it, Gertrud!

354
00:53:32,973 --> 00:53:35,710
I have to, God is forcing me.

355
00:53:35,814 --> 00:53:39,974
It is not God who is forcing you.
Have you told Storm already?

356
00:53:40,073 --> 00:53:43,710
-Not yet.
-You mustn't do it, Gertrud.

357
00:53:44,192 --> 00:53:49,192
If you do, Hellgum will only let you
meet those who share his faith.

358
00:53:49,535 --> 00:53:51,007
I realize that.

359
00:53:51,097 --> 00:53:54,732
Are you aware that it means...

360
00:53:55,587 --> 00:53:59,918
-That we can never meet again.
-You could also join.

361
00:54:00,116 --> 00:54:01,674
How can you say that?

362
00:54:01,764 --> 00:54:06,562
How could I join a mad swindler
who is taking everything from me?

363
00:54:10,096 --> 00:54:14,985
-Think it through carefully.
-I've been thinking the whole winter.

364
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:19,110
-Think again!
-Let me go! You are crazy!

365
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:22,242
Yes, Hellgum drives me mad!
This has got to stop!

366
00:54:22,346 --> 00:54:26,731
-What do you mean?
You'll never join the Hellgumians!

367
00:54:27,215 --> 00:54:30,258
Ingmar! Wait!

368
00:54:47,046 --> 00:54:51,651
She should never have gone
with you to Amerikal

369
00:54:51,849 --> 00:54:56,218
You refused the doctor to help!
You killed my sister!

370
00:54:56,417 --> 00:55:00,879
She left me and the children
to join your damned sect!

371
00:55:01,156 --> 00:55:02,842
Satans priest!

372
00:55:02,933 --> 00:55:07,027
-You don't know what's good for you!
-Damned preacher!

373
00:55:07,876 --> 00:55:09,144
She is dead!

374
00:55:09,234 --> 00:55:15,167
You refused to let the doctor
help my sister! You killed her!

375
00:55:15,271 --> 00:55:17,838
You have taken the life of my sister!

376
00:55:25,277 --> 00:55:26,561
She's dead!

377
00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:30,238
Damn preacher!
You killed my sister!

378
00:55:34,767 --> 00:55:36,417
Enough!

379
00:55:42,066 --> 00:55:44,450
Get out of here, both of you!

380
00:56:25,825 --> 00:56:28,361
lngmar, what have you done?

381
00:56:30,743 --> 00:56:34,676
Good God!
This cannot be!

382
00:56:50,530 --> 00:56:52,503
Help lngmar first!

383
00:56:52,895 --> 00:56:57,808
-He was trying to kill you.
-He chased my assassins away!

384
00:57:11,427 --> 00:57:15,558
Stop, lngmar!
Let me bind your wound.

385
00:57:15,755 --> 00:57:18,602
God bless you, Ingmar.
You saved Hellgum.

386
00:57:18,705 --> 00:57:24,393
-Go away. Leave me alone.
-Tim and I are sorry for what we said.

387
00:57:24,496 --> 00:57:28,009
I was about to tell Hellgum
to give you the sawmill.

388
00:57:28,113 --> 00:57:31,150
-You can give it to him.
-I'm sorry, lngmar!

389
00:57:31,253 --> 00:57:36,457
I thought you were trying to kill him.
That's what it looked like.

390
00:57:37,133 --> 00:57:40,525
How could you think
your brother was a murderer?

391
00:57:41,104 --> 00:57:44,878
Ingmar, don't cast away
your life like this...

392
00:57:44,968 --> 00:57:47,342
before God and your fellow men!

393
00:57:47,827 --> 00:57:53,136
I'll do anything to give you back
the will to live.

394
00:57:56,814 --> 00:57:59,381
There is one thing you can do.

395
00:57:59,675 --> 00:58:05,539
Tell Hellgum to leave at once
and not show his face here again.

396
00:58:31,402 --> 00:58:34,571
There's something
I must ask you to do.

397
00:58:38,872 --> 00:58:42,169
It's something I promised lngmar
I would do.

398
00:59:08,701 --> 00:59:10,513
Won't you look at me?

399
00:59:11,866 --> 00:59:15,542
I'll leave soon but wanted
to say a few words to you.

400
00:59:18,995 --> 00:59:23,988
Last year, when you moved out
I began to be very fond of you.

401
00:59:27,043 --> 00:59:29,370
My long was so great...

402
00:59:30,901 --> 00:59:34,337
But not even once
did you visit me.

403
00:59:34,535 --> 00:59:39,366
-It was if I didn't exist for you.
-I didn't want to meet you...

404
00:59:40,439 --> 00:59:44,450
until I had earned a little money
so I could propose.

405
00:59:47,828 --> 00:59:49,826
I thought you had forgotten me.

406
00:59:53,122 --> 00:59:56,687
You have no idea how much
I suffered all winter.

407
00:59:57,932 --> 01:00:00,042
And then Hellgum came...

408
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:03,510
He was kind and comforted me.

409
01:00:04,599 --> 01:00:09,042
He said my heart would be utterly at
peace if I gave it completely to God.

410
01:00:12,192 --> 01:00:14,717
I got so angry
with you yesterday.

411
01:00:16,819 --> 01:00:20,117
I was afraid
I wouldn't be able to resist you.

412
01:00:20,989 --> 01:00:24,038
That the struggle within me
would begin again...

413
01:00:27,391 --> 01:00:31,698
And then last night I heard
you had helped the man you hated.

414
01:00:34,471 --> 01:00:36,792
I could no longer resist you.

415
01:00:38,137 --> 01:00:42,982
I could no longer do anything
that would keep me apart from you.

416
01:00:47,826 --> 01:00:49,010
Gertrud...

417
01:01:09,971 --> 01:01:12,749
Well, dear brothers and sisters...

418
01:01:13,237 --> 01:01:19,409
Hellgum has something very important
to say to us all.

419
01:01:34,553 --> 01:01:35,957
My dear friends.

420
01:01:37,593 --> 01:01:39,079
I must tell you...

421
01:01:40,609 --> 01:01:45,529
Yes, I'm leaving you.
Already today.

422
01:01:45,977 --> 01:01:50,937
God spoke to me last night.
God has been merciful to us.

423
01:01:51,135 --> 01:01:54,779
For a long time
we have enjoyed His gifts.

424
01:01:54,976 --> 01:01:59,351
He has let me live among you
in this paradise.

425
01:01:59,550 --> 01:02:04,883
But now time has come
for new tasks and new challenges.

426
01:02:05,938 --> 01:02:09,139
-I must leave.
-What about us?

427
01:02:09,243 --> 01:02:13,704
Continual sacrifice
is the way of God.

428
01:02:14,383 --> 01:02:19,336
But I know that I am
responsible for you before God.

429
01:02:19,439 --> 01:02:23,050
I will not abandon you
to the devil...

430
01:02:23,248 --> 01:02:27,019
or let you drown
in the river of brimstone.

431
01:02:27,217 --> 01:02:32,392
For there is hope for salvation...
in Jerusalem

432
01:02:32,685 --> 01:02:36,510
Jerusalem!
That is where God is calling me.

433
01:02:36,614 --> 01:02:41,100
His holy city Jerusalem.
And there is hope for you!

434
01:02:42,725 --> 01:02:47,275
Today...
God will call all those...

435
01:02:47,853 --> 01:02:50,607
who are to follow me
to Jerusalem.

436
01:02:55,964 --> 01:03:01,939
Are we to abandon all we own
and move to a foreign land?

437
01:03:02,041 --> 01:03:03,757
Not foreign land!

438
01:03:04,346 --> 01:03:09,117
God is sending us to the same land
to which He once sent Jesus.

439
01:03:09,695 --> 01:03:14,263
Where shall we live?
How shall we support ourselves?

440
01:03:14,353 --> 01:03:19,981
-He's saving us from Armageddon.
-I'll go first and arrange everything.

441
01:03:20,465 --> 01:03:25,935
Mrs. Gordon and our American brothers
and sisters have already moved there.

442
01:03:26,232 --> 01:03:30,577
You'll have to sell
your goods and chattels.

443
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:34,474
-Strike off the fetters that bind you!
-Hallelujah!

444
01:03:34,576 --> 01:03:37,578
We shall walk
where Jesus walked.

445
01:03:37,681 --> 01:03:42,364
We shall build a paradise! The glory
of the Lord shall manifest on earth!

446
01:03:43,930 --> 01:03:47,443
We shall be redeemed. Amen.

447
01:03:47,833 --> 01:03:49,456
Amen.

448
01:03:49,846 --> 01:03:52,229
Now concentrate your minds.

449
01:03:54,316 --> 01:03:57,246
Say not a word to each other.

450
01:03:58,111 --> 01:04:01,223
God calls those
who are worthy of him.

451
01:04:04,508 --> 01:04:08,191
You must be completely silent...
And listen.

452
01:04:09,817 --> 01:04:11,032
Listen.

453
01:04:16,175 --> 01:04:19,167
What God's voice
tells you to do...

454
01:04:21,062 --> 01:04:22,966
is what you should do.

455
01:04:24,084 --> 01:04:27,860
Lord Jesus,
here are your children.

456
01:04:28,929 --> 01:04:32,595
Choose those you wish to call
to the Holy City.

457
01:04:32,699 --> 01:04:35,366
Choose those who are
to meet You.

458
01:04:35,660 --> 01:04:39,391
Those who to see You
appear in the heavens!

459
01:04:40,065 --> 01:04:43,122
Speak to each
and every one of them.

460
01:04:49,526 --> 01:04:52,813
-Let my cry come unto Thee!
-God, hear my prayer!

461
01:04:53,718 --> 01:04:57,646
-Lord, thank you!
-I hear God's voice!

462
01:04:58,645 --> 01:05:03,463
The Lord is calling me!
The Lord is calling me!

463
01:05:05,234 --> 01:05:09,701
-Thank you... Thank you...
-Karin... Karin?

464
01:05:09,899 --> 01:05:12,519
Perhaps God deems me unworthy.

465
01:05:12,622 --> 01:05:17,083
He thinks I love our fields
and pastures too much.

466
01:05:17,173 --> 01:05:19,614
Be quiet, Tim, and concentrate.

467
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:25,608
Listen!
Can't you hear the angels' harps?

468
01:05:25,698 --> 01:05:29,977
O God, take me under Your wing.

469
01:05:30,067 --> 01:05:32,684
The harps precede God's voice.

470
01:05:32,774 --> 01:05:37,617
Do not leave me in hell!
Don't leave me on my own.

471
01:05:38,115 --> 01:05:40,395
Now! Yes!

472
01:05:42,887 --> 01:05:46,235
I shall also go.
God is calling me!

473
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:48,901
I have been called!

474
01:06:05,707 --> 01:06:08,516
What am I bid for this cushion?

475
01:06:09,683 --> 01:06:11,090
No bids?

476
01:06:14,706 --> 01:06:18,345
Sold for 20 ore
to the lady over there.

477
01:06:18,435 --> 01:06:21,788
It'll be something
to remember the Ingmarssons by.

478
01:06:21,878 --> 01:06:25,951
Then we have two silver bowls.
Twenty-five ore! Thirty!

479
01:06:33,498 --> 01:06:35,624
I wonder who'll buy the farm.

480
01:06:35,776 --> 01:06:38,051
A rich farmer said he would.

481
01:06:38,141 --> 01:06:42,212
His daughter will get the farm as
a dowry if Ingmar marries her.

482
01:06:43,849 --> 01:06:49,483
We continue with a cabinet.
Seventy-five ore! One crown...

483
01:06:49,682 --> 01:06:52,841
People say the farm can be yours.

484
01:06:52,944 --> 01:06:58,689
It would be the best thing you
could do for us and the parish.

485
01:07:15,405 --> 01:07:19,596
It is what one loves the most that
should first be offered to the Lord.

486
01:07:26,302 --> 01:07:28,676
Then perhaps we can continue.

487
01:07:28,778 --> 01:07:33,954
The forestry company bids 26.000.
Sven Persson...?

488
01:07:34,058 --> 01:07:37,859
-27.000.
-Then I bid 29.000.

489
01:07:38,342 --> 01:07:40,629
-30.000.
-32.000.

490
01:07:44,467 --> 01:07:46,405
What do you say, Sven?

491
01:07:51,491 --> 01:07:56,114
-33.000.
-Let's get this over with, 40.000.

492
01:08:04,015 --> 01:08:05,102
No.

493
01:08:06,737 --> 01:08:08,224
Are you sure?

494
01:08:12,913 --> 01:08:14,444
I quit.

495
01:08:15,771 --> 01:08:19,454
Well! The lngmarsson farm
goes to the forest company.

496
01:08:19,835 --> 01:08:22,766
Their bid is for 40.000 crowns.

497
01:08:23,059 --> 01:08:26,278
You'll never get a better offer.

498
01:08:26,382 --> 01:08:30,164
Do you accept
the forest company's offer?

499
01:08:30,764 --> 01:08:34,119
-I think...
-May I say something?

500
01:08:34,322 --> 01:08:38,597
The forestry company will demolish
the farm and plant trees instead.

501
01:08:38,687 --> 01:08:43,212
A disappearance of the lngmarsson farm
will be a disaster for the parish.

502
01:08:43,315 --> 01:08:45,867
But Sven Persson is a farmer.

503
01:08:45,971 --> 01:08:50,158
He wants to carry on farming here.

504
01:08:50,418 --> 01:08:55,243
So let Sven Persson
buy the farm for 33.000.

505
01:08:56,042 --> 01:08:59,906
It is more than you
expected anyway.

506
01:09:04,201 --> 01:09:06,487
We accept
Sven Persson's bid instead.

507
01:09:12,621 --> 01:09:16,788
Thank you. Everything will
remain as it was, I assure you.

508
01:09:16,969 --> 01:09:18,104
Good luck!

509
01:09:20,928 --> 01:09:25,352
May I ask you something?
Do you intend to live here yourself?

510
01:09:25,737 --> 01:09:29,743
No, I'm marrying off
my daughter Barbro.

511
01:09:30,133 --> 01:09:32,994
It's for her and
her husband-to-be.

512
01:09:33,154 --> 01:09:36,873
Then there will once again be
an lngmar lngmarsson on this farm.

513
01:09:55,420 --> 01:09:57,746
Then I must congratulate you.

514
01:09:58,236 --> 01:10:01,180
We have been antagonists
in this matter.

515
01:10:01,860 --> 01:10:04,286
If God doesn't want you
to follow us,

516
01:10:04,376 --> 01:10:07,552
I thank him that he lets you
take care of the farm.

517
01:10:45,922 --> 01:10:48,618
Go home and
tell Gertrud the truth.

518
01:10:50,352 --> 01:10:53,657
That I betrayed her and
sold myself to get the farm.

519
01:10:56,225 --> 01:10:59,453
Tell her to put me out
of her mind forever.

520
01:11:14,209 --> 01:11:15,478
God...

521
01:11:16,627 --> 01:11:20,564
O God,
take this terror away from me.

522
01:11:23,938 --> 01:11:28,790
O God,
help me out of this sorrow!

523
01:13:20,966 --> 01:13:25,500
God, help me.
Help me out of this!

524
01:13:25,941 --> 01:13:28,995
I don't want revenge.
I want no evil in me!

525
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:33,968
Help me!
Remove this sorrow from me!

526
01:17:34,239 --> 01:17:38,954
-Can I help you with anything?
-I need to talk to the bridegroom.

527
01:17:39,664 --> 01:17:42,917
I see...
Just a moment.

528
01:17:50,726 --> 01:17:54,974
Excuse me. There is a woman outside
wishing to speak to lngmar.

529
01:17:55,617 --> 01:18:00,598
Say that lngmar is dancing with his
bride and cannot talk to others.

530
01:18:01,767 --> 01:18:03,221
Wait a moment!

531
01:18:11,928 --> 01:18:13,248
Ingmar?

532
01:18:15,615 --> 01:18:19,377
There's a woman outside
who wants to talk to you.

533
01:18:31,593 --> 01:18:35,053
I'm sorry to disturb you
on your wedding day.

534
01:18:36,683 --> 01:18:37,884
Ingmar...

535
01:18:41,868 --> 01:18:46,830
Last year, when I decided
to join the Hellgumians...

536
01:18:48,048 --> 01:18:51,256
I had given my heart to Christ...

537
01:18:51,617 --> 01:18:55,188
but I took it back in order
to give it to you.

538
01:18:56,497 --> 01:18:58,537
It was wrong of me.

539
01:18:59,272 --> 01:19:03,622
I betrayed Christ and have in return
been betrayed by my beloved.

540
01:19:03,791 --> 01:19:07,952
No, it's not that way.
It isn't God's plan to punish you.

541
01:19:08,119 --> 01:19:13,414
It's not punishment, it's to show me
I made the wrong decision.

542
01:19:16,376 --> 01:19:19,101
It isn't a punishment...

543
01:19:20,330 --> 01:19:24,859
I'm so happy.
I don't miss anything.

544
01:19:25,886 --> 01:19:28,719
All my sorrow has been
taken from me.

545
01:19:30,885 --> 01:19:35,000
Ingmar,
I shall tell you a secret.

546
01:19:36,119 --> 01:19:38,851
I have met him.

547
01:19:40,544 --> 01:19:42,955
I have seen Jesus.

548
01:19:45,393 --> 01:19:48,777
He has taken my sorrow from me
and I love Him.

549
01:19:49,421 --> 01:19:52,881
Now I cannot love another
in this world.

550
01:19:57,668 --> 01:20:01,018
The real purpose of my visit is...

551
01:20:01,284 --> 01:20:06,354
I have a present for you.
Something that is yours.

552
01:20:07,758 --> 01:20:12,923
My mother bought a cushion at the
auction and I used it as a pillow.

553
01:20:14,236 --> 01:20:19,496
One night when I could not sleep,
I found something hard within it.

554
01:20:22,277 --> 01:20:27,106
I found a package that rustled
when I touched it.

555
01:20:33,498 --> 01:20:39,626
I pulled out the package and
found your name on it.

556
01:20:40,819 --> 01:20:44,612
I realized it must be the money
that Elias hid.

557
01:20:47,828 --> 01:20:50,327
Here is your inheritance, lngmar.

558
01:20:58,779 --> 01:21:00,020
Oh God!

559
01:21:02,818 --> 01:21:04,712
So this is your revenge!

560
01:21:05,739 --> 01:21:09,111
-Why do you call it revenge?
-What else should I call it?

561
01:21:11,945 --> 01:21:16,603
-Why didn't you bring it at once?
-It was for your wedding day.

562
01:21:20,922 --> 01:21:25,347
-Had you come earlier I'd have bought
the farm and married you. -I know.

563
01:21:27,476 --> 01:21:29,130
Now it's too late.

564
01:21:32,136 --> 01:21:34,434
It was too late anyway, lngmar.

565
01:21:37,772 --> 01:21:40,136
It was too late a week ago.

566
01:21:41,544 --> 01:21:44,236
It's too late, now
and forevermore.

567
01:21:48,168 --> 01:21:53,556
Ingmar, you had a choice.
You didn't love me enough.

568
01:23:06,708 --> 01:23:13,050
You can always come back
if you change your mind.

569
01:23:14,429 --> 01:23:18,125
Can't you stay? I beg you!

570
01:23:39,345 --> 01:23:43,429
-Aren't you coming, Hans?
-I can't.

571
01:23:44,072 --> 01:23:48,479
Last night I looked out over
the fields and thought:

572
01:23:49,026 --> 01:23:55,260
"Can the hills of Jerusalem be
more beautiful than these? "

573
01:23:56,196 --> 01:24:01,979
Then, when I saw the river and
the mountains beyond, I thought:

574
01:24:02,249 --> 01:24:07,759
"Our Lord cannot pour fire and
brimstone over all this? "

575
01:24:08,495 --> 01:24:13,375
The way I reckon,
he must have liked it...

576
01:24:13,465 --> 01:24:17,196
when He made it with
His own hands.

577
01:25:45,367 --> 01:25:47,499
Don't forget the big bag!

578
01:26:01,336 --> 01:26:04,903
We'll soon be there.
We'll be ashore before long.

579
01:26:05,731 --> 01:26:08,700
Do you see that white city?
That is Jaffa.

580
01:26:16,091 --> 01:26:18,159
Look, there's our land!

581
01:26:39,495 --> 01:26:43,716
Welcome dear friends...
Welcome Karin!

582
01:26:44,866 --> 01:26:48,496
Hello Hellgum.
You have a beard!

583
01:26:49,044 --> 01:26:54,258
Welcome to the Holy Land!
Welcome, Gertrud!

584
01:26:57,235 --> 01:27:01,858
Mrs. Gordon could not be here
but she awaits us at the colony.

585
01:27:02,174 --> 01:27:06,114
Go to the railway station.
Our train departs in an hour.

586
01:27:08,853 --> 01:27:12,874
You should have your papers ready
and show them here.

587
01:27:13,038 --> 01:27:16,756
Over here, on the right.

588
01:27:19,304 --> 01:27:22,922
Everyone at the colony
calls Mrs. Gordon "Mamma".

589
01:27:23,162 --> 01:27:27,866
It feels natural to do so.
The English word used is: "Mother".

590
01:27:27,956 --> 01:27:31,748
Use the tip of your tongue:
" Mother".

591
01:27:36,898 --> 01:27:41,205
They speak English, so I'll interpret
until you've learned the language.

592
01:28:03,947 --> 01:28:07,263
We've arrived. Here's the colony.

593
01:28:07,719 --> 01:28:12,103
Here are your American and German
sisters and brothers.

594
01:28:20,830 --> 01:28:23,099
This is my husband.

595
01:28:25,453 --> 01:28:26,798
Tim is my name.

596
01:28:28,487 --> 01:28:29,851
This is little Greta.

597
01:28:32,932 --> 01:28:34,164
That's it.

598
01:28:36,260 --> 01:28:37,851
Dad's little girl...

599
01:28:38,014 --> 01:28:40,080
We are so happy to be here.

600
01:28:40,170 --> 01:28:43,407
He has a cousin in Wisconsin.

601
01:28:43,497 --> 01:28:47,855
He's not very big.
Maybe you've met him.

602
01:28:48,893 --> 01:28:50,417
He is a blacksmith.

603
01:28:50,598 --> 01:28:53,114
Let's go in.
Mother is waiting for us.

604
01:28:53,377 --> 01:28:55,718
We can get the luggage later.

605
01:29:12,335 --> 01:29:13,878
Here is Mother.

606
01:29:46,123 --> 01:29:50,497
Then Mother said that you can come
up to her office one by one.

607
01:29:50,757 --> 01:29:54,082
You can then donate your savings.

608
01:29:54,172 --> 01:29:56,352
Here are the dormitories.

609
01:29:56,442 --> 01:30:00,191
The men sleep for themselves
in this hall here...

610
01:30:00,451 --> 01:30:02,543
The women sleep over here.

611
01:30:03,935 --> 01:30:08,492
But can't the families...?
We can live together, can't we?

612
01:30:08,582 --> 01:30:14,268
The women sleep with their sisters,
the men with their brothers.

613
01:30:14,431 --> 01:30:18,532
-But what about the children?
-They sleep with the other children.

614
01:30:18,622 --> 01:30:23,001
They get to like it after a while.
I'll show you where they sleep.

615
01:30:25,408 --> 01:30:28,896
Greta, you're going to sleep
with the other children.

616
01:30:31,015 --> 01:30:35,812
They're very nice children.
Daddy will go with you and show you.

617
01:31:25,537 --> 01:31:29,136
-Where have you been?
-Down by the school.

618
01:31:29,873 --> 01:31:33,938
People say you row there every
evening and sit on a rock.

619
01:31:34,098 --> 01:31:36,420
Let people say what they want.

620
01:31:37,834 --> 01:31:41,310
You must realize that it is no fun
for a wife to hear such talk.

621
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:45,002
A wife who has bought her husband
can expect nothing better.

622
01:32:01,027 --> 01:32:06,191
I had a fiancé once.
I was very much in love with him.

623
01:32:07,022 --> 01:32:11,441
One day I told him there
was a curse on our family.

624
01:32:13,607 --> 01:32:16,735
Any children I had might
not be healthy.

625
01:32:20,962 --> 01:32:23,293
He became terribly frightened.

626
01:32:24,983 --> 01:32:28,459
From that day on he would
have nothing to do with me.

627
01:32:31,538 --> 01:32:34,014
It was so humiliating.

628
01:32:35,319 --> 01:32:39,098
I decided to live in solitude
for the rest of my life.

629
01:32:40,407 --> 01:32:45,713
My father wanted you me to marry.
He began sending suitors to me.

630
01:32:46,641 --> 01:32:49,705
In order to put a stop to it all...

631
01:32:51,113 --> 01:32:54,063
...I asked for the impossible:

632
01:32:55,136 --> 01:33:01,449
I asked for you and the lngmarsson
farm. I just wanted to be left alone.

633
01:33:02,482 --> 01:33:08,320
Tim and Karin had the farm and you
were going to marry Gertrud.

634
01:33:22,072 --> 01:33:25,609
I realize that this has all
been a game for you.

635
01:33:28,617 --> 01:33:31,718
I didn't understand
what I had done...

636
01:33:31,882 --> 01:33:37,391
until I heard that Gertrud had left
her parents and gone to Jerusalem.

637
01:33:40,376 --> 01:33:42,934
Since then I have had no peace.

638
01:33:44,712 --> 01:33:48,261
I never wanted to wanted
to make anyone else so unhappy.

639
01:33:49,569 --> 01:33:56,176
Now I see that you are tormented.
I feel that everything is my fault.

640
01:33:56,337 --> 01:33:59,464
No, I am to blame for
my own guilt.

641
01:34:01,245 --> 01:34:05,212
If I had done to you
what I did to Gertrud...

642
01:34:05,375 --> 01:34:07,575
would you have forgiven me?

643
01:34:13,644 --> 01:34:14,781
No.

644
01:34:18,770 --> 01:34:22,166
Then perhaps you understand
what it is like for me.

645
01:37:23,691 --> 01:37:26,351
I wanted to help her!

646
01:37:46,622 --> 01:37:48,593
Am I a murderess now?

647
01:37:50,846 --> 01:37:54,741
I'm not to blame!
You are! You are!

648
01:41:00,430 --> 01:41:05,431
Can we not send for a doctor?
We must send for one.

649
01:41:05,597 --> 01:41:09,755
You know we cannot.
It's forbidden!

650
01:41:09,924 --> 01:41:14,606
Only Mother can help. If He hears
her prayers He will show mercy.

651
01:43:13,526 --> 01:43:16,803
Do you still believe God
is protecting us?

652
01:43:17,152 --> 01:43:19,754
How could you say such a thing?

653
01:43:22,680 --> 01:43:27,091
-Why would he send us here to die?
-Hold your peace, Sister Gertrud.

654
01:44:05,783 --> 01:44:09,146
O God, forgive all those
who hate and insult us.

655
01:44:09,694 --> 01:44:13,437
Mat Thy Son descend to earth
and become a part of us.

656
01:44:15,409 --> 01:44:16,635
Dear God...

657
01:44:17,725 --> 01:44:20,200
May Jesus come and redeem us.

658
01:44:41,946 --> 01:44:46,945
Can you keep a secret?
Jesus is coming.

659
01:44:47,393 --> 01:44:50,194
-But not today?
-No, tomorrow.

660
01:44:50,451 --> 01:44:55,863
I thought Jesus had forgotten us but
I realize He allows us to suffer...

661
01:44:56,029 --> 01:44:59,761
because the last days of
the world are at hand.

662
01:45:00,688 --> 01:45:05,340
That is why God has lacked the power
to vanquish all evil and lies.

663
01:45:11,141 --> 01:45:15,889
Jesus will return.
Soon He will descend from heaven.

664
01:45:16,347 --> 01:45:20,794
That's why we were all summoned
here. We are about to meet him!

665
01:45:29,723 --> 01:45:32,990
Gertrud, Gertrud...

666
01:46:13,695 --> 01:46:19,333
I was worried about you, lngmar.
You are never usually away so long.

667
01:46:19,944 --> 01:46:23,039
I worried that you might
have hurt yourself.

668
01:46:43,439 --> 01:46:46,008
Come. Try to rest awhile.

669
01:48:09,032 --> 01:48:11,057
Try to drink a little.

670
01:48:11,228 --> 01:48:15,179
-It smells disgusting.
-Do you want me to die?

671
01:48:15,919 --> 01:48:20,520
You have drunk nothing for days.
You must drink.

672
01:48:20,685 --> 01:48:24,518
It's from the cistern.
-It is filtered. It is all right.

673
01:48:24,608 --> 01:48:27,416
It is safe to drink.

674
01:48:33,219 --> 01:48:36,282
Just take a little sip.

675
01:48:36,454 --> 01:48:40,739
Will nobody help me
to get clean water?

676
01:48:41,289 --> 01:48:45,210
Am I to lie here and die
with nobody to help me?

677
01:48:45,379 --> 01:48:50,951
We are all helping as best we can.
There is no better water in Jerusalem.

678
01:48:51,439 --> 01:48:56,402
Well, it does! Were you not with me
when we looked at the mosques?

679
01:48:56,567 --> 01:48:58,060
Yes, I was with you.

680
01:48:58,150 --> 01:49:01,855
In the Mosque of Omar there is a well
in the grounds.

681
01:49:02,117 --> 01:49:05,953
It is Jerusalem's only clean well.
that has good water.

682
01:49:06,617 --> 01:49:10,712
-Why do you think that?
-It has it's source in Paradise!

683
01:49:11,739 --> 01:49:16,568
The Garden of Paradise is down there.
Forest, trees, flowers and birds.

684
01:49:16,830 --> 01:49:21,169
A river of clear and pure water
runs through it.

685
01:49:23,434 --> 01:49:25,986
It's all in her imagination,
poor girl.

686
01:49:27,103 --> 01:49:30,514
They have asked for you
in the kitchen, Sister Karin.

687
01:49:36,064 --> 01:49:40,461
-Can you attend to her?
-I shall do my best.

688
01:49:41,576 --> 01:49:43,902
Try to get her to drink something.

689
01:49:53,869 --> 01:49:55,684
Brother Gabriel...

690
01:49:55,774 --> 01:49:59,863
Please persuade Sister Karin
that the water in the well...

691
01:49:59,953 --> 01:50:04,728
is the best water in the city.
She won't get me any!

692
01:50:11,411 --> 01:50:15,921
I'll go to Jerusalem and fetch you
some of that water.

693
01:50:16,011 --> 01:50:21,055
Don't do it! It's only because I'm so
thirsty that I talk so much.

694
01:50:21,553 --> 01:50:26,489
The well is holy for Mohammedans.
They'd never let a Christian in.

695
01:50:26,654 --> 01:50:30,940
-I'll dress like a Mohammedan.
-A Mohammedan?

696
01:50:32,840 --> 01:50:34,407
You must be mad!

697
01:50:35,143 --> 01:50:40,130
I could ask the old cobbler next door
if I could borrow his clothes.

698
01:50:41,070 --> 01:50:45,372
-Is he here today?
-Yes, he is.

699
01:50:49,440 --> 01:50:54,862
-I'll do it this afternoon.
-It's dangerous. They'll kill you!

700
01:50:54,952 --> 01:50:57,252
Do not fear, Sister Gertrud.

701
01:50:58,852 --> 01:51:03,522
-How will you carry the water?
-I'll carry a large jar.

702
01:51:04,739 --> 01:51:07,900
There are many people about
at this time.

703
01:51:09,785 --> 01:51:13,673
Nobody will recognize me if I'm
dressed as a water-bearer.

704
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:17,092
But inside the Damascus Gate
it will be harder.

705
01:51:17,740 --> 01:51:21,498
But I know how to force my way
through the crowds...

706
01:51:22,329 --> 01:51:25,147
I might be recognized
at any time...

707
01:51:25,328 --> 01:51:28,508
It is so kind of you to
get me some water...

708
01:51:29,692 --> 01:51:34,587
I pass by the prison, with many
policemen standing outside.

709
01:51:34,844 --> 01:51:39,767
-But you quickly go past it.
-Yes, but I think they recognize me.

710
01:51:40,510 --> 01:51:43,645
I run with the heavy jar.

711
01:51:43,815 --> 01:51:47,439
They pursue me but
I escape in the crowd.

712
01:51:50,278 --> 01:51:54,055
At last I'll enter
the temple grounds.

713
01:51:55,364 --> 01:52:00,219
I can see the well and I hasten
to join the other water-carriers.

714
01:52:01,050 --> 01:52:04,394
I dip my jar into the
Well of Paradise...

715
01:52:05,802 --> 01:52:10,517
and fill it up with the purest,
clearest spring water.

716
01:52:12,583 --> 01:52:16,759
And then I think: "As soon
Gertrud drinks this water"...

717
01:52:18,075 --> 01:52:19,783
"she will recover."

718
01:52:24,999 --> 01:52:28,206
Then I finally reach home
with the water.

719
01:52:32,287 --> 01:52:37,499
Will you not taste the water from
the Well of Paradise, Sister Gertrud?

720
01:52:50,253 --> 01:52:54,687
God bless you, Brother Gabriel.
You have saved my life.

721
01:52:56,476 --> 01:52:58,311
Do you want more?

722
01:52:59,623 --> 01:53:03,336
Give some to the others,
so they may recover.

723
01:53:04,069 --> 01:53:06,124
The water is only for you.

724
01:53:06,952 --> 01:53:09,568
Don't you want to taste it?

725
01:53:10,687 --> 01:53:12,333
Yes, I'd like to.

726
01:53:40,905 --> 01:53:42,035
Telegram.

727
01:53:43,146 --> 01:53:44,488
Thanks.

728
01:53:49,193 --> 01:53:53,556
Barbro... I have some
sad news for you.

729
01:53:56,022 --> 01:53:57,698
What has happened?

730
01:54:00,356 --> 01:54:02,082
Your father is dead.

731
01:54:13,202 --> 01:54:14,652
Well...

732
01:54:16,706 --> 01:54:21,342
This is news of great import
for both of us.

733
01:54:31,584 --> 01:54:34,231
We have been granted our freedom.

734
01:54:36,360 --> 01:54:40,155
-Now we shall get divorced.
-Why do you say that?

735
01:54:42,737 --> 01:54:47,193
Now father is dead, there's
nothing to stop us.

736
01:54:47,363 --> 01:54:48,812
Never!

737
01:54:51,007 --> 01:54:54,516
I want you to go to Jerusalem
and bring Gertrud home.

738
01:54:55,953 --> 01:54:58,955
You must do it
for Gertrud's sake.

739
01:54:59,227 --> 01:55:03,349
And for my sake, that I may once
again have peace of mind.

740
01:55:04,463 --> 01:55:08,548
Be glad you can make amends
for your wrongs.

741
01:55:12,329 --> 01:55:17,509
I'll do as you say.
I shall do my duty towards Gertrud.

742
01:55:19,201 --> 01:55:23,169
-But I don't want to divorce.
-You must understand something:

743
01:55:24,191 --> 01:55:27,146
I can never be the wife you need.

744
01:55:28,451 --> 01:55:33,341
I cannot give you healthy children.
They'd be blind idiots.

745
01:55:33,697 --> 01:55:37,262
-There's a curse on our family.
-Do you really believe that?

746
01:55:37,352 --> 01:55:39,361
It's hopeless, lngmar.

747
01:55:42,204 --> 01:55:45,883
We must divorce.
That's the way it is.

748
01:55:48,515 --> 01:55:50,367
That's what I want it.

749
01:55:50,823 --> 01:55:55,110
Go to Jerusalem and fetch Gertrud.
Try to forget me.

750
01:56:20,454 --> 01:56:23,855
Good God, what have they done
with our dead?

751
01:56:47,665 --> 01:56:51,219
What have they done
to my little Greta?

752
01:57:18,782 --> 01:57:23,116
My dear... little child...

753
01:57:25,871 --> 01:57:30,793
My dear little Greta...
We knew nothing of this.

754
01:57:36,686 --> 01:57:40,002
Had I known, you would never
have been laid to rest here.

755
01:58:21,339 --> 01:58:22,576
Hello?

756
01:58:25,223 --> 01:58:26,645
Hello!

757
01:58:41,163 --> 01:58:42,396
But Tim...!

758
01:58:51,536 --> 01:58:56,297
They have dug up our dead.
They lie under open sky.

759
01:58:56,463 --> 01:59:01,302
-I'll fetch Sister Karin.
-No, my heart hurts too much.

760
01:59:01,468 --> 01:59:03,496
Promise me...

761
01:59:04,712 --> 01:59:10,573
Promise me that little Greta will be
properly buried in hallowed ground.

762
01:59:13,408 --> 01:59:18,272
I don't want her to think
she has a bad father.

763
01:59:19,490 --> 01:59:22,090
And let me lie beside her.

764
01:59:23,214 --> 01:59:29,457
Tell Karin that I want to wear
my wedding ring in my grave.

765
02:02:17,402 --> 02:02:21,100
Well...
How are things in Sweden?

766
02:02:22,995 --> 02:02:23,921
Fine.

767
02:02:24,466 --> 02:02:27,142
Do folks back home think of us?

768
02:02:27,562 --> 02:02:31,165
Some of us have thought of you
every single day since you left.

769
02:02:35,079 --> 02:02:38,988
And your wife? Is she looking after
the farm while you are away?

770
02:02:39,435 --> 02:02:41,424
Is she a good housewife?

771
02:02:42,545 --> 02:02:44,681
I couldn't ask for a better one.

772
02:02:49,168 --> 02:02:51,202
Have you got any children?

773
02:02:51,860 --> 02:02:54,361
No, we have not had any children.

774
02:02:55,761 --> 02:02:57,948
Barbro and I are to divorce.

775
02:03:00,542 --> 02:03:02,811
What are you saying, lngmar?

776
02:03:04,507 --> 02:03:07,487
None of our family
have ever divorced.

777
02:03:07,750 --> 02:03:10,205
We are already legally separated.

778
02:03:10,935 --> 02:03:14,876
-But what do you have against her?
-Nothing whatsoever.

779
02:03:16,281 --> 02:03:19,980
-Is it she who wants to divorce?
-Yes, it is her wish.

780
02:03:21,001 --> 02:03:24,863
I'm glad that Father is dead
and has been spared this.

781
02:03:26,448 --> 02:03:30,879
It is indeed good he is dead.
He has been spared a great deal.

782
02:03:31,900 --> 02:03:34,604
So you are here
for Gertrud's sake?

783
02:03:35,344 --> 02:03:38,797
In my struggle to keep the farm
in the family...

784
02:03:40,300 --> 02:03:42,357
I abused Gertrud's trust.

785
02:03:42,994 --> 02:03:45,751
I abused her most
precious quality:

786
02:03:46,678 --> 02:03:49,776
Her love of others and
her trust in them.

787
02:03:52,517 --> 02:03:56,468
I heard rumors that she was
loosing her mind down here.

788
02:03:57,867 --> 02:04:00,929
I have come to shoulder
my responsibility.

789
02:04:01,857 --> 02:04:05,693
Don't think you can come
and ruin Gertrud's life again.

790
02:04:06,236 --> 02:04:09,365
Whose life has been ruined
by whom, Karin?

791
02:04:24,088 --> 02:04:26,104
It's been a long time.

792
02:04:28,655 --> 02:04:33,689
-How are you?
-Well. Very well...

793
02:04:34,807 --> 02:04:37,420
Your mother and father say hello.

794
02:04:38,061 --> 02:04:41,459
Thank you.
What is the purpose of your visit?

795
02:04:42,115 --> 02:04:44,338
I want to see how things are.

796
02:04:44,604 --> 02:04:48,821
If you think you can take me back
to Sweden, you are wrong.

797
02:04:49,482 --> 02:04:52,937
I gather you have been ill.
Even very ill.

798
02:04:53,325 --> 02:04:58,342
Don't bring up the past.
You have no right to do that.

799
02:05:00,228 --> 02:05:04,722
I'm doing fine. I've never been
so happy as I'm now.

800
02:05:05,507 --> 02:05:07,949
My love for Jesus is complete.

801
02:05:49,425 --> 02:05:52,700
No wonder Jesus stayed here.

802
02:05:52,870 --> 02:05:56,606
God knows what He would have said
had he been here today?

803
02:05:57,172 --> 02:06:02,508
Perhaps: "Except ye become as children
ye shall not enter into My kingdom. "

804
02:06:04,009 --> 02:06:08,183
Since I came to Jerusalem, I have
almost felt like a child.

805
02:06:09,200 --> 02:06:13,053
I have childish faith in people,
even in our persecutors.

806
02:06:13,143 --> 02:06:17,016
-I feel the same way.
-Do you really think he would say:

807
02:06:17,106 --> 02:06:21,782
"Except ye become as children
ye shall not enter into My kingdom"?

808
02:06:22,136 --> 02:06:24,371
What would your answer be?

809
02:06:26,152 --> 02:06:30,415
I would say:
"Lord, we love everyone as children. "

810
02:06:30,505 --> 02:06:33,991
-What would Christ say?
-Nothing. Just...

811
02:06:34,347 --> 02:06:39,099
"Except ye become as children
ye shall not enter into My kingdom. "

812
02:06:40,075 --> 02:06:44,460
Then I would begin to understand what
He means and I would say:

813
02:06:45,773 --> 02:06:48,627
"Lord, I have also
become a child. "

814
02:06:49,271 --> 02:06:52,618
"For I no longer feel the
yearning I used to."

815
02:06:53,167 --> 02:06:56,101
"For my beloved
is but a playmate. "

816
02:06:57,317 --> 02:07:00,122
"A sister with whom
I pick olives. "

817
02:07:07,377 --> 02:07:09,811
"No, Lord, I am not a child."

818
02:07:11,421 --> 02:07:13,952
I cannot enter into Your kingdom.

819
02:07:15,275 --> 02:07:18,253
"I cannot quench the fire
in my heart."

820
02:07:24,521 --> 02:07:26,318
I love you, Gertrud.

821
02:07:27,926 --> 02:07:30,986
As a man loves a woman.
I can not help it.

822
02:07:33,007 --> 02:07:36,772
Forgive me... forgive me...

823
02:08:11,106 --> 02:08:15,348
Bear down...
as hard as you can!

824
02:08:16,385 --> 02:08:19,645
Here it comes.
It'll soon be over...

825
02:08:30,658 --> 02:08:34,852
-What was it?
-A boy. A cute little boy.

826
02:08:42,673 --> 02:08:48,589
He's not cute at all.
He is blue all over!

827
02:08:48,946 --> 02:08:52,915
His eyes are swollen.
Can't you see?

828
02:08:54,888 --> 02:08:56,683
He looks strange.

829
02:08:59,643 --> 02:09:03,420
I knew it. I knew it...

830
02:09:07,332 --> 02:09:09,916
Nobody must ever know about him.

831
02:09:11,032 --> 02:09:14,427
He's an idiot and blind with it.
I knew it...

832
02:09:15,639 --> 02:09:19,222
Nobody must ever see him.
I knew it...

833
02:11:33,806 --> 02:11:38,218
-Have you seen Brother Gabriel?
-He went to Jaffa to buy grain.

834
02:11:38,477 --> 02:11:42,746
Ingmar, I can't wait anymore.
I have to tell someone!

835
02:11:43,483 --> 02:11:45,161
I have met Christ!

836
02:11:47,053 --> 02:11:50,520
-The Lord has risen again!
-Gertrud...

837
02:11:53,642 --> 02:11:56,289
Tell me exactly where
you saw him.

838
02:12:09,662 --> 02:12:11,107
Gertrud...

839
02:12:12,620 --> 02:12:14,759
I think I've found him.

840
02:12:17,351 --> 02:12:19,131
Have you found Him...?

841
02:12:19,221 --> 02:12:23,156
After you told me what you saw,
I went looking for him.

842
02:12:23,900 --> 02:12:27,976
Ingmar...! So you believed me
in spite of everything...!

843
02:12:29,005 --> 02:12:31,728
Have you ever seen such a face?

844
02:12:32,946 --> 02:12:37,504
-No, I haven't...
-I knew He would return!

845
02:12:38,432 --> 02:12:40,875
You must show me where He is!

846
02:12:41,237 --> 02:12:45,925
This very evening.
I can wait no longer.

847
02:12:46,858 --> 02:12:52,866
How lucky you are, not having had
to wait as long as the rest of us.

848
02:12:54,927 --> 02:12:56,940
You look tired, lngmar.

849
02:12:58,061 --> 02:13:03,679
Your conscience has troubled you
for my sake but it was God's will.

850
02:13:03,849 --> 02:13:08,908
It was God's mercy that guided you to
Jerusalem at just the right time.

851
02:13:09,375 --> 02:13:10,782
We go in here.

852
02:13:31,084 --> 02:13:33,759
Are you sure this is the place?

853
02:13:33,926 --> 02:13:37,656
Yes, this is where I saw him
with his disciples.

854
02:13:40,615 --> 02:13:42,965
One expects pomp and splendor...

855
02:13:43,055 --> 02:13:46,497
but simplicity and poverty is
the way Jesus teaches.

856
02:13:49,519 --> 02:13:50,844
Do you see?

857
02:14:00,607 --> 02:14:02,511
Do you see His disciples?

858
02:14:46,671 --> 02:14:47,827
Yes...!

859
02:14:50,104 --> 02:14:51,546
It's Him!

860
02:14:55,547 --> 02:14:58,311
You can see he is no normal man.

861
02:15:00,578 --> 02:15:02,465
He is going to speak!

862
02:15:05,160 --> 02:15:07,709
I can't wait to hear his voice.

863
02:15:31,391 --> 02:15:34,465
Why doesn't he tell them
to stop that?

864
02:15:42,019 --> 02:15:44,732
Has He nothing else
to teach them?

865
02:16:19,676 --> 02:16:22,226
Was he the man you saw yesterday?

866
02:16:25,444 --> 02:16:26,483
Yes.

867
02:16:32,012 --> 02:16:36,585
Did my happiness cause you such
pain that you had to show me this?

868
02:16:41,624 --> 02:16:45,489
-I shall never forgive you.
-I understand...

869
02:16:46,940 --> 02:16:49,441
But I had to do what was right.

870
02:16:49,703 --> 02:16:52,669
Why did you have to take
my faith from me?

871
02:16:54,068 --> 02:16:56,874
Why could you not let me keep it?

872
02:17:57,509 --> 02:18:00,293
There are visitors waiting outside.

873
02:18:00,844 --> 02:18:03,406
You must attend the little one.

874
02:18:03,931 --> 02:18:09,418
I'll say you have a cold and they
had better not risk catching it.

875
02:18:34,700 --> 02:18:39,609
They'll hear the child crying
unless you keep it quiet!

876
02:19:37,753 --> 02:19:40,569
It's all right. They've gone now.

877
02:19:41,142 --> 02:19:46,343
You think you're so clever?
I know there were no visitors.

878
02:19:46,991 --> 02:19:52,747
-You wanted to make me hold him.
-I'll take him out again if you want.

879
02:19:52,837 --> 02:19:57,142
No. He's fallen asleep. He can
stay here until he wakes up.

880
02:20:03,665 --> 02:20:07,763
-What do you with him him at night?
-He sleeps in the barn.

881
02:20:08,791 --> 02:20:12,489
Do you let him sleep there
like a kitten?

882
02:20:12,746 --> 02:20:18,326
I didn't think you cared. He
can be in here if you want.

883
02:20:20,217 --> 02:20:23,230
I think we'd better change him.

884
02:20:34,825 --> 02:20:39,267
You're not holding him right.
No wonder he's crying.

885
02:20:39,998 --> 02:20:43,238
I'm as good at caring for children
as you are.

886
02:20:43,328 --> 02:20:48,269
-His face is turning blue!
-People say I'm good with children

887
02:20:48,431 --> 02:20:51,544
But if you're quite sure
you know best...

888
02:20:53,758 --> 02:20:55,200
Here you are.

889
02:21:05,312 --> 02:21:06,423
See...?

890
02:21:37,752 --> 02:21:42,764
I doubt that other mothers
with healthy children

891
02:21:42,854 --> 02:21:48,005
feel as much love for their infants
as I feel for you, you poor mite.

892
02:21:55,295 --> 02:21:56,342
Eva...

893
02:21:58,228 --> 02:22:03,046
lngmar must never know about him.
Do you understand?

894
02:22:06,177 --> 02:22:08,684
Not until he has married Gertrud.

895
02:22:28,728 --> 02:22:32,009
Mother advises you to
return home immediately...

896
02:22:32,544 --> 02:22:37,205
Tell Mrs. Gordon...
that I shall leave the colony.

897
02:22:38,580 --> 02:22:40,817
That I'll leave Jerusalem.

898
02:22:41,183 --> 02:22:45,030
And tell her that I wish to take
Gertrud with me.

899
02:22:46,249 --> 02:22:50,706
I can't tell her that. Sister Gertrud
will never leave with you.

900
02:22:50,875 --> 02:22:57,277
I know what you think, Karin.
But please translate word for word.

901
02:23:02,843 --> 02:23:05,607
My brother says he'll go.

902
02:23:22,787 --> 02:23:27,742
Gertrud is very ill.
She has not been well for some time.

903
02:23:29,370 --> 02:23:33,439
People are talking about her. She is
destroying the colony's reputation.

904
02:23:35,263 --> 02:23:37,241
Tell Mrs. Gordon...

905
02:23:38,861 --> 02:23:41,943
that if she lets Gertrud
go with me...

906
02:23:42,869 --> 02:23:45,258
she'll have one problem less...

907
02:23:46,855 --> 02:23:50,369
and the colonies' reputation
will remain intact.

908
02:23:53,231 --> 02:23:57,750
And tell her
that I need Gabriel as well.

909
02:24:33,342 --> 02:24:35,552
I'm leaving, Sister Gertrud.

910
02:24:38,449 --> 02:24:42,676
Ingmar needs medical care in
Sweden. I'll take him home.

911
02:24:42,845 --> 02:24:47,095
-He always gets what he needs!
-He also wants you to come along.

912
02:24:50,098 --> 02:24:51,232
Never!

913
02:24:53,136 --> 02:24:56,500
Consider the matter,
Sister Gertrud.

914
02:24:56,962 --> 02:25:00,815
-Mother wouldn't allow it...
-Ingmar has spoken to her.

915
02:25:00,976 --> 02:25:04,880
If he thinks he can take over
my life yet again, he's wrong!

916
02:25:10,233 --> 02:25:12,532
You must forgive him, Gertrud.

917
02:25:14,042 --> 02:25:16,839
Consider how much he loved you.

918
02:25:17,207 --> 02:25:20,287
Had you seen him
at the auction...

919
02:25:20,651 --> 02:25:25,055
you would have seen how much he
suffered and how he loved you.

920
02:25:25,888 --> 02:25:28,298
You must forgive him, Gertrud.

921
02:25:31,606 --> 02:25:35,479
Our Christian faith is based
on forgiving each other.

922
02:25:40,656 --> 02:25:44,299
Otherwise you will never
be able to love another.

923
02:26:47,319 --> 02:26:49,629
Wait, Brother Gabriel!

924
02:26:49,719 --> 02:26:53,814
I forgot to give you the letters
for the folks back home!

925
02:26:56,476 --> 02:26:58,533
I need to talk to lngmar.

926
02:27:00,716 --> 02:27:04,493
Ingmar, there's something
I must tell you.

927
02:27:04,661 --> 02:27:09,170
I received a letter from home.
There's something you should know.

928
02:27:10,726 --> 02:27:14,126
A boy has been born on
the Ingmarsson farm.

929
02:27:15,069 --> 02:27:18,877
I thought you should know
before you set off for home.

930
02:27:21,694 --> 02:27:25,635
-Was it Barbro who wrote to you?
-No, it wasn't Barbro.

931
02:27:27,644 --> 02:27:29,321
Farewell, lngmar.

932
02:27:36,107 --> 02:27:37,475
Farewell, Karin.

933
02:27:45,961 --> 02:27:49,147
-Farewell, Sister Gertrud.
-Farewell, Sister Karin.

934
02:27:51,098 --> 02:27:54,271
-Farewell, Brother Gabriel.
-Farewell, Sister Karin.

935
02:29:13,427 --> 02:29:17,901
Gertrud! Gabriel!
Welcome!

936
02:29:48,615 --> 02:29:51,300
My dear girl! Welcome!

937
02:29:52,328 --> 02:29:56,295
My dear child! Welcome home!
My dear child...!

938
02:30:02,346 --> 02:30:05,341
-Gabriel!
-Hello Mr Storm.

939
02:30:06,175 --> 02:30:08,390
-Storm...
-lngmar...

940
02:30:55,134 --> 02:30:56,421
Come in!

941
02:31:01,324 --> 02:31:03,675
Pray forgive the intrusion.

942
02:31:17,677 --> 02:31:19,480
You must be Gertrud.

943
02:31:22,581 --> 02:31:25,068
And you are Barbro, I presume.

944
02:31:26,965 --> 02:31:30,075
I won't stay long, but...

945
02:31:31,429 --> 02:31:33,305
-Is lngmar here?
-No.

946
02:31:34,531 --> 02:31:37,256
-Do you know where he is?
-Yes...

947
02:31:38,086 --> 02:31:42,413
-He went up to the lngmarsson farm.
-Why should he go there?

948
02:31:43,424 --> 02:31:46,384
He couldn't bear to wait
any longer...

949
02:31:47,403 --> 02:31:51,813
even though you are legally separated
and he shouldn't return.

950
02:31:56,114 --> 02:31:59,839
You seem to think nobody knows
you have born a child.

951
02:32:00,853 --> 02:32:02,628
But everyone knows.

952
02:32:04,815 --> 02:32:08,255
Everyone knows... even lngmar.

953
02:32:17,027 --> 02:32:20,946
May I ask you...
if you love lngmar?

954
02:32:23,372 --> 02:32:26,885
No. I no longer love lngmar.

955
02:32:31,823 --> 02:32:33,058
Go now...

956
02:32:35,227 --> 02:32:37,111
he is waiting for you.

957
02:33:12,071 --> 02:33:13,697
Where's the boy?

958
02:33:13,878 --> 02:33:17,463
lngmar is here.
He took him to church.

959
02:33:28,969 --> 02:33:32,470
Good day, Barbro.
We were waiting for you.

960
02:33:35,535 --> 02:33:38,220
What are you doing here
with the boy?

961
02:33:38,376 --> 02:33:42,681
How dare you? You know you are
banned from the Ingmarsson farm.

962
02:33:42,771 --> 02:33:48,709
It's my duty to ensure
he is properly baptized.

963
02:33:50,027 --> 02:33:55,008
I heard you had hidden him
as though he did not exist.

964
02:33:57,014 --> 02:33:58,608
I had no choice.

965
02:34:00,135 --> 02:34:03,485
He is entitled to be baptized
and given a name.

966
02:34:05,300 --> 02:34:08,360
Don't give yourself problems
for my sake.

967
02:34:14,227 --> 02:34:17,336
I need to know what the boy
is to be called.

968
02:34:20,217 --> 02:34:22,807
Perhaps Barbro has
a name in mind?

969
02:34:27,197 --> 02:34:31,261
His name is lngmar, like that of
all the first-born Ingmarsson sons.

970
02:34:34,699 --> 02:34:40,160
Now you think you are kind to me, but
I must repeat what I have said:

971
02:34:41,174 --> 02:34:43,807
The boy cannot
be called lngmar...

972
02:34:45,650 --> 02:34:48,376
for he is both blind
and an idiot.

973
02:34:49,272 --> 02:34:54,782
-Let's hear what the doctor says.
-You can see he's ugly and sick.

974
02:34:55,036 --> 02:34:58,672
Children in our family come
no prettier than this.

975
02:34:59,120 --> 02:35:01,836
But you can see he is blind.

976
02:35:01,926 --> 02:35:04,395
What on earth makes you say that?

977
02:35:04,964 --> 02:35:10,577
I'll give you some eyewash. The
swelling will be gone in a week.

978
02:35:11,308 --> 02:35:14,714
His eyes will be as clear as
those of other children.

979
02:35:23,079 --> 02:35:26,285
In that case, let us continue
with the baptism.

980
02:35:28,473 --> 02:35:32,407
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

981
02:35:33,527 --> 02:35:35,469
Lift up your hearts to God.

982
02:35:36,414 --> 02:35:40,269
O Lord Jesus,
baptism has been ordinated by Thee.

983
02:35:41,294 --> 02:35:46,089
As he said to His disciples:
"To Me is given all power in heaven."

984
02:36:36,559 --> 02:36:40,013
O Lord, Thou art my rock,
my redeemer and my sole comfort.

985
02:36:41,614 --> 02:36:45,450
On my narrow path of pain
I have lost my dear ones.

986
02:36:45,615 --> 02:36:49,537
But I fear nothing, for I know
that Thy love is eternal.

987
02:36:50,659 --> 02:36:54,960
I thank Thee for leading me
to the Holy Land.

988
02:36:56,265 --> 02:36:59,310
Here, in Thy light,
I find salvation.

989
02:37:00,148 --> 02:37:04,148
Here in Thy light I find Thou art
utterly close to me.

990
02:37:06,023 --> 02:37:08,118
Here in Thy Jerusalem.

991
02:37:10,108 --> 02:37:11,356
Amen.

992
02:37:33,919 --> 02:37:37,019
