1
00:00:28,356 --> 00:00:33,277
The Passengers

2
00:01:23,424 --> 00:01:26,701
I've come to pick up a 4th grade student,
Marc Letessier.

3
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:28,190
Your name?

4
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:29,260
Moineau.

5
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:40,944
Too bad Madame Letessier
could not come.

6
00:01:41,582 --> 00:01:42,833
Moineau.

7
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,892
Excuse me?

8
00:01:45,354 --> 00:01:47,022
She is Madame Moineau now.

9
00:01:47,142 --> 00:01:48,494
Oh, forgive me.
I forgot.

10
00:01:49,411 --> 00:01:54,124
I find her decision to take Marc
out of school regrettable.

11
00:01:54,415 --> 00:01:56,099
It will disturb him needlessly.

12
00:01:56,361 --> 00:01:58,561
Couldn't it wait until summer?

13
00:01:59,226 --> 00:02:01,104
It's not for me to decide.

14
00:02:02,297 --> 00:02:04,769
I hope Marc was not
put in this school...

15
00:02:04,889 --> 00:02:07,794
only because we teach in French.

16
00:02:08,694 --> 00:02:11,239
Do you know if your wife
plans to put Marc...

17
00:02:11,359 --> 00:02:13,207
in a religious institution in Paris?

18
00:02:13,557 --> 00:02:16,257
He will go to a regular school.

19
00:02:17,657 --> 00:02:18,478
Very well.

20
00:02:22,588 --> 00:02:26,337
Tell Marc Letessier his step-father
is waiting in my office.

21
00:02:34,469 --> 00:02:37,330
Has Madame Moineau
quit her job at Air France?

22
00:02:37,331 --> 00:02:40,042
No, she was transfered to Paris.

23
00:02:47,178 --> 00:02:48,177
Come in.

24
00:02:50,872 --> 00:02:51,788
Hello, Marc.

25
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,522
Hello, Madam director.

26
00:02:55,411 --> 00:02:56,357
Hello.

27
00:02:57,112 --> 00:02:58,371
Hello, Alex.

28
00:03:09,781 --> 00:03:11,300
Put your seatbelt on.

29
00:03:11,899 --> 00:03:13,453
We're being followed.

30
00:03:14,263 --> 00:03:15,124
Come on!

31
00:03:16,734 --> 00:03:18,519
I think you lost him
at the turn.

32
00:03:18,757 --> 00:03:19,723
You'll see.

33
00:03:20,678 --> 00:03:23,682
The last time I saw you
we were on familiar terms.

34
00:03:24,007 --> 00:03:25,381
I've forgotten.

35
00:03:26,107 --> 00:03:28,007
Here he is again.

36
00:03:29,634 --> 00:03:31,016
Put your seatbelt on.

37
00:03:31,484 --> 00:03:33,661
He was parked
in front of the school.

38
00:03:33,781 --> 00:03:36,123
I saw him follow us
from there.

39
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:38,694
Sit up
and put your seatbelt on.

40
00:03:39,777 --> 00:03:41,407
Maybe he's a spy.

41
00:03:42,063 --> 00:03:43,107
Who?

42
00:03:43,635 --> 00:03:45,507
The guy who's following us.

43
00:03:48,865 --> 00:03:50,373
GPU...
Have you heard?

44
00:03:50,374 --> 00:03:52,691
First of all,
it's not GPU...

45
00:03:52,762 --> 00:03:54,391
it's called KGB now.

46
00:03:54,721 --> 00:03:56,412
And why
would they follow us?

47
00:03:56,806 --> 00:04:00,630
Simple!
They mistook our car for another.

48
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,963
A bit amateurish
those spies of yours.

49
00:04:03,593 --> 00:04:06,007
Or maybe
they're industrial spies.

50
00:04:06,008 --> 00:04:09,356
Or a private detective paid by...

51
00:04:09,695 --> 00:04:14,163
the school director
to make sure I donate at churches.

52
00:04:14,972 --> 00:04:16,990
You don't believe in God?

53
00:04:19,118 --> 00:04:20,071
Why do you ask?

54
00:04:20,314 --> 00:04:21,753
Just asking.

55
00:04:25,841 --> 00:04:28,127
Here's the entrance
to the highway.

56
00:04:44,773 --> 00:04:45,892
What are you doing?

57
00:04:46,664 --> 00:04:48,016
Just like I thought.

58
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:49,121
What?

59
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,953
They're taking the highway too.

60
00:04:50,954 --> 00:04:52,523
Of course!

61
00:04:53,107 --> 00:04:55,804
No law forbids spies
to use the highway.

62
00:04:59,078 --> 00:05:00,617
Will you put
that seatbelt on?

63
00:05:00,846 --> 00:05:03,839
Really, old man,
1897 km of nagging...

64
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,647
Won't be fun.

65
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,292
1897 km?

66
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,929
I did the math
from the map.

67
00:05:11,138 --> 00:05:12,415
We'll be there after tomorrow.

68
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:13,587
After tomorrow?

69
00:05:14,393 --> 00:05:16,007
Why didn't we fly with mom?

70
00:05:16,719 --> 00:05:18,923
Your mom wanted us
to bring her car.

71
00:05:19,043 --> 00:05:21,066
Your mom loves her car.

72
00:05:22,049 --> 00:05:25,912
Since I love your mom,
I promised to bring her car.

73
00:05:26,383 --> 00:05:28,046
She doesn't want us
to drive at night,...

74
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:29,893
so it will take 3 days.

75
00:05:30,551 --> 00:05:33,777
If you want the whole story,
your mom figured...

76
00:05:33,778 --> 00:05:35,959
it would do us good
to spend some time together.

77
00:05:36,197 --> 00:05:38,615
So we get to know each other.

78
00:05:38,616 --> 00:05:41,253
She didn't ask my advice
when she married you.

79
00:05:42,045 --> 00:05:43,898
I don't see why
she'd feel guilty now.

80
00:05:44,117 --> 00:05:45,790
Don't flatter yourself, kid.

81
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,760
It's not about guilt.

82
00:05:48,444 --> 00:05:50,304
If you don't want us
to be friends...

83
00:05:50,305 --> 00:05:52,563
your mom will get over it,
and I will too.

84
00:05:53,107 --> 00:05:55,107
It's no tragedy.

85
00:05:59,698 --> 00:06:02,329
So far I like your type.

86
00:06:03,324 --> 00:06:04,916
And what type is that?

87
00:06:04,917 --> 00:06:07,882
The no nonsense type.

88
00:06:41,907 --> 00:06:42,510
What will it be?

89
00:06:42,729 --> 00:06:44,118
Black coffee for me.

90
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:46,066
And for the young man?

91
00:06:46,401 --> 00:06:47,382
What would you like?

92
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:48,683
Same thing as you.

93
00:06:48,803 --> 00:06:49,971
You're not having black coffee.

94
00:06:51,033 --> 00:06:52,521
Cappuccino
with lots of milk.

95
00:06:52,826 --> 00:06:55,732
Not a cappuccino!
Makes me sick.

96
00:06:56,104 --> 00:06:57,678
Black coffee at your age?

97
00:06:57,798 --> 00:07:00,101
My age, my age...
Like you know anything.

98
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,682
You don't have to be rude.

99
00:07:04,122 --> 00:07:07,168
Give him what he likes.
A black coffee.

100
00:07:10,528 --> 00:07:12,328
I didn't want to offend you,
but...

101
00:07:12,944 --> 00:07:15,746
I don't like to be treated like this,
that's all.

102
00:07:16,847 --> 00:07:18,363
I am not offended.

103
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:20,638
Would you like some sugar?

104
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:21,739
No.

105
00:07:38,227 --> 00:07:43,924
Could you ask for some milk?
It tastes bad.

106
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:50,346
A drop of milk, please.

107
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:58,762
Full tank, please.

108
00:08:01,262 --> 00:08:03,076
Don't say anything.
I'll try to guess.

109
00:08:03,276 --> 00:08:04,507
Milan?

110
00:08:05,048 --> 00:08:06,440
Enno, you try.

111
00:08:07,873 --> 00:08:08,526
- Rome?
- No.

112
00:08:08,595 --> 00:08:10,420
- What then?
- Paris.

113
00:08:10,607 --> 00:08:12,743
Two in a row.
Impossible!

114
00:08:14,107 --> 00:08:16,537
Paris!
They all go to Paris!

115
00:08:26,976 --> 00:08:28,853
That's our route?

116
00:08:28,854 --> 00:08:29,943
Yes.

117
00:08:32,032 --> 00:08:33,751
Where do we stay tonight?

118
00:08:33,752 --> 00:08:35,278
Look, it's written there.

119
00:08:35,797 --> 00:08:38,170
Orvieto.
Holiday Inn Hotel.

120
00:08:38,357 --> 00:08:39,971
It's all booked and all that?

121
00:08:40,337 --> 00:08:41,313
And all that.

122
00:08:41,314 --> 00:08:42,907
Couldn't you plan more?

123
00:08:43,308 --> 00:08:45,237
Believe me,
after driving all day...

124
00:08:45,272 --> 00:08:47,891
I'd rather not have to search
for a hotel room.

125
00:08:48,455 --> 00:08:51,196
Like I said:
mom is marrying an organizer.

126
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,066
That's a big change for her.

127
00:08:54,265 --> 00:08:55,159
Really?

128
00:08:55,194 --> 00:08:55,914
Oh yeah.

129
00:08:56,664 --> 00:08:58,453
By the way,
what do you do for work?

130
00:08:58,471 --> 00:08:59,835
Accountant?

131
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:00,836
Engineer.

132
00:09:02,673 --> 00:09:04,459
What about your career plans?

133
00:09:08,107 --> 00:09:09,278
Hey.

134
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:12,199
I asked you a question.

135
00:09:14,969 --> 00:09:16,043
Writer.

136
00:09:16,733 --> 00:09:17,725
Writer?

137
00:09:18,297 --> 00:09:19,243
Yes.

138
00:09:21,409 --> 00:09:23,097
Why didn't you want
to tell me?

139
00:09:23,962 --> 00:09:25,216
I was afraid you'd laugh.

140
00:09:25,508 --> 00:09:27,635
Laugh?
I think it's great.

141
00:09:28,382 --> 00:09:29,009
Really?

142
00:09:29,338 --> 00:09:30,797
I'll still have to pay your bills...

143
00:09:30,824 --> 00:09:31,738
when you're 40.

144
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:32,784
Not necessarily.

145
00:09:33,025 --> 00:09:34,778
Some writers
make a lot of money.

146
00:09:35,227 --> 00:09:36,200
Yes, some do.

147
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,443
Did you see that?

148
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:42,997
Yes, I did.

149
00:09:43,087 --> 00:09:44,490
How do you explain that?

150
00:09:45,744 --> 00:09:46,618
Simple.

151
00:09:47,691 --> 00:09:51,013
Instead of stopping
at the cafe with us...

152
00:09:51,107 --> 00:09:52,126
he had his coffee break here.

153
00:09:52,433 --> 00:09:54,285
And since his speed
is equal to ours...

154
00:09:54,307 --> 00:09:55,908
it was inevitable
we'd meet again.

155
00:09:57,066 --> 00:09:57,829
Are you convinced?

156
00:09:58,158 --> 00:10:00,910
You'll say the same thing
if we see him after dinner.

157
00:10:23,598 --> 00:10:26,868
If everyone did like you,
life would be easier.

158
00:10:27,856 --> 00:10:29,902
They all come
between 7 and 8.

159
00:10:30,107 --> 00:10:32,417
It's always a big mess.

160
00:10:32,807 --> 00:10:34,541
Now is the perfect time.

161
00:10:35,219 --> 00:10:37,035
- Going far?
- Paris.

162
00:10:37,396 --> 00:10:39,852
I'll take a burger with salad.

163
00:10:40,824 --> 00:10:43,172
Some people are lucky.

164
00:10:43,607 --> 00:10:46,038
All my life I've dreamt
of going to Paris.

165
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:48,701
You'll go, some day.

166
00:10:49,408 --> 00:10:50,919
How much do you think
I make here?

167
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,853
With or without tips?

168
00:10:53,295 --> 00:10:54,320
With tips.

169
00:10:54,665 --> 00:10:56,666
Not much.

170
00:10:57,357 --> 00:10:59,957
So how could I go to Paris?

171
00:11:07,301 --> 00:11:09,519
- Are you expecting someone?
- No!

172
00:11:10,107 --> 00:11:13,631
- How about...
- Yes, burger and salad.

173
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,070
I am done.

174
00:11:35,532 --> 00:11:38,341
What?
You can't leave all that.

175
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:39,957
You said you were hungry.

176
00:11:40,307 --> 00:11:42,427
I don't eat very much.

177
00:11:42,707 --> 00:11:44,932
You'll get used to it -
I sleep a lot instead.

178
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:47,735
I sleep like crazy.

179
00:11:48,057 --> 00:11:52,042
If I'm not woken up,
I sleep 13-15 hours.

180
00:11:52,607 --> 00:11:53,678
It always scares mom.

181
00:11:53,907 --> 00:11:56,103
She always thinks
I'm dead or sick.

182
00:11:56,303 --> 00:11:58,736
Have some cheese though.

183
00:11:59,157 --> 00:12:00,507
And what if I don't?

184
00:12:00,907 --> 00:12:02,607
I'll leave you here to hitchhike.

185
00:12:02,807 --> 00:12:03,907
No problem.

186
00:12:04,107 --> 00:12:06,964
I'll wait for the guy
who's following us.

187
00:12:12,772 --> 00:12:15,765
- Something to drink?
- Nope.

188
00:12:16,107 --> 00:12:17,987
I have a girl friend like that.

189
00:12:18,107 --> 00:12:19,907
She never drinks while eating.

190
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:21,741
She says it makes you fat.

191
00:12:21,861 --> 00:12:22,830
I don't believe it.

192
00:12:26,258 --> 00:12:28,837
Actually,
I will have a coffee.

193
00:12:30,755 --> 00:12:33,328
I am sure you're married,
with 5 kids.

194
00:12:33,528 --> 00:12:35,313
No.

195
00:12:39,197 --> 00:12:41,427
What about that coffee?

196
00:12:42,703 --> 00:12:45,481
In life, you need to go
after the things you want.

197
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:47,852
Instead of waiting
for them to happen.

198
00:12:48,272 --> 00:12:49,914
What do you think?

199
00:12:53,224 --> 00:12:56,636
If everyone stays in their corner...

200
00:12:56,864 --> 00:12:58,651
without trying to communicate...

201
00:12:58,947 --> 00:12:59,928
it's the end.

202
00:13:02,772 --> 00:13:06,057
I am for communication.

203
00:13:07,433 --> 00:13:08,288
Please.

204
00:13:10,578 --> 00:13:12,390
There is no need to be afraid of women.

205
00:13:12,929 --> 00:13:14,607
I've noticed that...

206
00:13:15,563 --> 00:13:18,571
When women know what they want
and say it...

207
00:13:19,176 --> 00:13:20,750
men get scared.

208
00:13:23,699 --> 00:13:25,310
What's gotten into you?

209
00:13:38,045 --> 00:13:39,560
Wait, wait!

210
00:15:08,421 --> 00:15:09,245
Sir!

211
00:15:12,013 --> 00:15:12,981
Good evening.

212
00:15:13,255 --> 00:15:13,996
Evening.

213
00:15:14,169 --> 00:15:15,329
Are you alone?

214
00:15:15,542 --> 00:15:16,672
Yes, alone.

215
00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:19,431
Why haven't you stopped before?

216
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:21,316
Where before?

217
00:15:21,431 --> 00:15:22,558
At the restaurant.

218
00:15:23,606 --> 00:15:25,339
What's wrong?

219
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:26,714
Was I going too fast?

220
00:15:26,834 --> 00:15:28,050
No. Show me your papers.

221
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,301
My papers? Of course.

222
00:15:36,538 --> 00:15:37,187
Here.

223
00:15:48,332 --> 00:15:49,411
A pilot?

224
00:15:50,258 --> 00:15:51,067
You're a pilot?

225
00:15:51,762 --> 00:15:52,355
What?

226
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:54,452
You are an airline pilot?

227
00:15:54,967 --> 00:15:55,526
Yes.

228
00:15:55,971 --> 00:15:57,110
How do you know?

229
00:15:58,272 --> 00:15:59,753
This is a pilot's license.

230
00:16:00,232 --> 00:16:01,292
My mistake.

231
00:16:07,593 --> 00:16:09,484
Here is my driver's license.

232
00:16:11,273 --> 00:16:12,254
You're French?

233
00:16:12,835 --> 00:16:13,359
Yes.

234
00:16:14,395 --> 00:16:16,157
Show me your passport.

235
00:16:28,261 --> 00:16:29,508
Come with me.

236
00:16:31,749 --> 00:16:34,351
What have I done?

237
00:16:34,638 --> 00:16:35,635
Come with me.

238
00:18:18,017 --> 00:18:18,997
What's wrong?

239
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,273
It's taking a long time.

240
00:18:24,598 --> 00:18:25,647
Open the glove compartment.

241
00:18:26,128 --> 00:18:26,903
What for?

242
00:18:27,472 --> 00:18:29,090
Open it and you'll see.

243
00:18:30,241 --> 00:18:31,734
I can't because of the seatbelt.

244
00:18:32,297 --> 00:18:33,785
Take off the seatbelt
for a moment.

245
00:18:36,261 --> 00:18:37,264
What do I do now?

246
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,705
Look inside the glove compartment.

247
00:18:40,706 --> 00:18:41,629
What do you see?

248
00:18:41,925 --> 00:18:46,005
Kleenex papers, tapes, and candies.

249
00:18:47,313 --> 00:18:49,228
Ah, you don't like candies.

250
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:50,880
Have I offended you?

251
00:18:52,305 --> 00:18:53,136
Deeply.

252
00:18:55,236 --> 00:18:56,603
Sorry about that.

253
00:19:00,581 --> 00:19:01,978
Still offended?

254
00:19:02,404 --> 00:19:04,484
Stop fooling
and give me a candy.

255
00:19:07,251 --> 00:19:07,696
Here.

256
00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:08,659
Thanks.

257
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:10,174
You know you always say that?

258
00:19:10,448 --> 00:19:11,211
What?

259
00:19:11,331 --> 00:19:12,419
Stop fooling.

260
00:19:14,438 --> 00:19:15,304
Could be.

261
00:19:19,147 --> 00:19:21,177
Looking at your watch
won't make us go faster.

262
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,027
Has he gone back?

263
00:19:26,452 --> 00:19:27,193
Too bad.

264
00:19:28,052 --> 00:19:28,758
Why bad?

265
00:19:29,852 --> 00:19:31,509
We will never know
what he wanted.

266
00:19:32,382 --> 00:19:33,837
All the better.

267
00:19:37,514 --> 00:19:38,814
I will bet you 1000 francs

268
00:19:38,934 --> 00:19:41,378
that I can calculate how many cars

269
00:19:41,498 --> 00:19:43,292
will pass by inside 5 minutes.

270
00:19:44,418 --> 00:19:45,876
Old or new francs?

271
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:46,800
Old francs.

272
00:19:47,723 --> 00:19:48,509
Alright.

273
00:19:49,296 --> 00:19:50,127
Thirty five.

274
00:19:55,477 --> 00:19:57,608
Thirty three and seven over.

275
00:19:58,212 --> 00:19:58,679
Six.

276
00:19:59,260 --> 00:19:59,830
Five.

277
00:20:00,594 --> 00:20:01,310
Four.

278
00:20:02,222 --> 00:20:02,849
Three.

279
00:20:03,522 --> 00:20:04,126
Two.

280
00:20:05,028 --> 00:20:05,530
One.

281
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:06,316
Zero.

282
00:20:06,436 --> 00:20:08,037
You owe me 1000 francs.
Play again?

283
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,564
No thanks.

284
00:20:10,911 --> 00:20:11,994
How did you do it?

285
00:20:12,648 --> 00:20:15,577
Remember you scolded me
because I looked at my watch?

286
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:18,255
I calculated the average,

287
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,056
I verified it inside an hour,

288
00:20:20,614 --> 00:20:23,076
And I inferred mean timings.

289
00:20:23,412 --> 00:20:24,095
Brainy stuff, huh?

290
00:20:27,423 --> 00:20:29,258
You forgot to be dumb, you.

291
00:20:39,456 --> 00:20:40,504
I don't understand.

292
00:20:40,744 --> 00:20:42,214
You were fine in Rome.

293
00:20:42,334 --> 00:20:43,792
Why go back to Paris?

294
00:20:44,497 --> 00:20:47,207
Because it's my home,
you know that.

295
00:20:48,261 --> 00:20:49,008
Paris or Rome

296
00:20:49,967 --> 00:20:51,287
As long as we stay together.

297
00:20:54,156 --> 00:20:55,197
How do you think I felt

298
00:20:55,317 --> 00:20:56,736
when I called you

299
00:20:56,856 --> 00:20:58,851
and you said you were getting married?

300
00:21:00,174 --> 00:21:01,120
Did you think about it?

301
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:03,274
No.

302
00:21:04,447 --> 00:21:05,450
We haven't been in touch
for a long time.

303
00:21:05,994 --> 00:21:07,145
What does it change?

304
00:21:08,387 --> 00:21:08,900
I don't know.

305
00:21:13,925 --> 00:21:14,586
It hurts again?

306
00:21:14,962 --> 00:21:15,783
It's nothing.

307
00:21:16,425 --> 00:21:18,055
You still haven't been to a doctor?

308
00:21:18,442 --> 00:21:19,719
It's nothing, I am fine.

309
00:21:44,395 --> 00:21:46,850
I refused a private flight
last week.

310
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,135
What happened?

311
00:21:49,494 --> 00:21:50,360
It's always the same

312
00:21:50,913 --> 00:21:52,087
At first everythings goes well

313
00:21:52,941 --> 00:21:53,960
and then one day - boom

314
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,407
someone tells them about my accident.

315
00:21:56,547 --> 00:21:57,994
You mean, for three years

316
00:21:58,279 --> 00:22:00,535
someone has been calling
your employers

317
00:22:00,655 --> 00:22:03,567
just to tell them you were
responsible for the accident?

318
00:22:03,687 --> 00:22:04,894
It's not impossible.

319
00:22:05,874 --> 00:22:08,176
A mechanic has been trying
to pin everything on me.

320
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,361
Vittorio?

321
00:22:09,481 --> 00:22:11,446
The one who didn't check
the landing gear?

322
00:22:11,566 --> 00:22:12,734
I know he didn't check it.

323
00:22:14,594 --> 00:22:16,679
I thought the control tower was responsible.

324
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:17,625
They have forgotten too...

325
00:22:17,944 --> 00:22:19,061
The control tower too!

326
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:21,922
They never wanted to admit it.

327
00:22:24,272 --> 00:22:26,460
Was it the control tower or Vittorio?

328
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:29,069
I don't like it when you do this.

329
00:22:52,016 --> 00:22:53,042
Why do you laugh?

330
00:22:53,953 --> 00:22:55,629
They think they got rid of me.

331
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:01,047
I searched their car at the school carpark.

332
00:23:01,458 --> 00:23:03,908
I found the map, their route, hotels -
everything.

333
00:23:04,489 --> 00:23:05,571
Even your address in Paris.

334
00:23:07,634 --> 00:23:09,058
Then why follow them?

335
00:23:11,085 --> 00:23:12,157
Since you have my address?

336
00:23:12,715 --> 00:23:13,912
Why follow them?

337
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,138
It's mom!

338
00:23:32,641 --> 00:23:33,109
Hello?

339
00:23:34,419 --> 00:23:35,023
Hello?

340
00:23:35,479 --> 00:23:36,060
Mom?

341
00:23:36,299 --> 00:23:37,382
Jean-Marc, how are you?

342
00:23:37,769 --> 00:23:38,362
Fine!

343
00:23:39,011 --> 00:23:39,558
And you?

344
00:23:40,447 --> 00:23:41,655
Your trip is going well?

345
00:23:42,308 --> 00:23:44,440
Yes. We were followed.

346
00:23:46,149 --> 00:23:46,912
I swear.

347
00:23:47,243 --> 00:23:48,702
A guy in a van.

348
00:23:49,659 --> 00:23:51,072
We lost him at dinner time.

349
00:23:53,019 --> 00:23:55,777
So he didn't follow you for long.
What else?

350
00:23:56,084 --> 00:23:56,848
Nothing.

351
00:23:57,486 --> 00:23:59,868
I extorted 1000 francs
from your boyfriend.

352
00:24:00,426 --> 00:24:01,372
Well played!

353
00:24:03,393 --> 00:24:04,442
I love you very much.

354
00:24:04,989 --> 00:24:06,652
Me too mom. Bye!

355
00:24:09,626 --> 00:24:10,514
Hello Nicole.

356
00:24:11,654 --> 00:24:12,759
How are you doing?

357
00:24:13,614 --> 00:24:15,905
So-so. I miss you two.

358
00:24:16,144 --> 00:24:17,056
We too.

359
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:18,712
What's with the apartment?

360
00:24:19,373 --> 00:24:21,447
Painters are done.
Waiting for the furniture.

361
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,239
I've enough of sleeping on a mattress.

362
00:24:25,239 --> 00:24:25,820
Alone?

363
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,370
There was a painter but he left.

364
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:30,273
- What bad luck.
- It happens.

365
00:24:31,085 --> 00:24:31,780
I love you.

366
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:33,840
Me too.

367
00:24:34,397 --> 00:24:35,308
Then say it.

368
00:24:36,733 --> 00:24:38,180
I'm not alone.

369
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:38,935
So what?

370
00:24:39,055 --> 00:24:41,758
My son won't drop dead
if you tell me you love me.

371
00:24:42,992 --> 00:24:43,938
I love you.

372
00:24:45,209 --> 00:24:45,768
You could do better.

373
00:24:48,354 --> 00:24:49,186
How is it going with Marc?

374
00:24:49,306 --> 00:24:50,713
We're doing just fine.

375
00:24:51,778 --> 00:24:54,114
What  about that guy who followed you?

376
00:24:55,103 --> 00:24:57,052
It's just a story he made up.

377
00:24:57,576 --> 00:24:58,340
A game of his?

378
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,707
Yes, just a game.

379
00:25:01,474 --> 00:25:02,898
Well, kisses...

380
00:25:03,309 --> 00:25:04,403
A big kiss...

381
00:25:52,976 --> 00:25:54,754
Do you have a free room?

382
00:25:54,982 --> 00:25:55,859
It depends.

383
00:25:56,422 --> 00:25:57,231
On what?

384
00:25:57,823 --> 00:26:00,376
On nothing. I just like to joke.

385
00:26:00,496 --> 00:26:02,496
I joked all the time with my husbands.

386
00:26:03,801 --> 00:26:04,816
Advance payment.

387
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:09,055
Cards, cheques, golden watches are not accepted.

388
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,687
6500 lira.

389
00:26:17,771 --> 00:26:19,947
Room 235, second floor.

390
00:26:20,067 --> 00:26:22,363
Great room with a shower.
You're lucky.

391
00:26:23,127 --> 00:26:23,674
Thank you.

392
00:26:25,231 --> 00:26:25,983
Hey!

393
00:26:26,735 --> 00:26:28,456
No dying here, ok?

394
00:26:28,576 --> 00:26:29,596
I don't want problems.

395
00:26:29,716 --> 00:26:32,387
It's nothing. I only have a headache.

396
00:26:33,393 --> 00:26:35,513
I see. Have a good night.

397
00:27:24,463 --> 00:27:25,511
You're not sleepy?

398
00:27:25,739 --> 00:27:26,184
No.

399
00:27:30,866 --> 00:27:32,895
I shouldn't have told mom, right?

400
00:27:35,015 --> 00:27:35,584
About what?

401
00:27:36,166 --> 00:27:37,488
About the guy who's following us?

402
00:27:39,598 --> 00:27:41,979
Maybe it's a woman, who knows?

403
00:27:43,335 --> 00:27:44,464
It's not important.

404
00:27:44,919 --> 00:27:46,937
I didn't want to make her worry.

405
00:27:48,657 --> 00:27:49,615
What is it?

406
00:27:50,682 --> 00:27:52,517
I think about what you just said.

407
00:27:53,098 --> 00:27:54,648
That it might be a woman.

408
00:27:54,768 --> 00:27:56,602
A blond with big tits.

409
00:28:02,587 --> 00:28:03,806
Why do you say that?

410
00:28:05,288 --> 00:28:07,681
Every night I think about death.

411
00:28:08,935 --> 00:28:11,237
There is only one thing that distracts me:

412
00:28:11,722 --> 00:28:13,238
Women's tits.

413
00:28:13,956 --> 00:28:15,517
It helps to think of them.

414
00:28:15,637 --> 00:28:17,227
Why is that, do you think?

415
00:28:18,526 --> 00:28:19,962
It seems logical.

416
00:28:20,082 --> 00:28:21,170
Logical?

417
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:22,286
Sure.

418
00:28:23,837 --> 00:28:25,843
Do you know why grown-ups smoke?

419
00:28:26,857 --> 00:28:27,552
No.

420
00:28:28,635 --> 00:28:30,276
It reminds them of their mom's tit.

421
00:28:30,755 --> 00:28:31,552
Oh yes.

422
00:28:35,176 --> 00:28:36,179
Good night.

423
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:37,934
Sleep well.

424
00:29:20,729 --> 00:29:21,972
Are there fingerprints?

425
00:29:22,092 --> 00:29:23,225
Don't know yet.

426
00:29:24,171 --> 00:29:25,937
Should I ask you by registered mail?

427
00:29:34,836 --> 00:29:36,066
Time of death?

428
00:29:36,186 --> 00:29:37,992
Five-six o'clock.

429
00:29:38,823 --> 00:29:40,076
Motherfucker.

430
00:29:51,005 --> 00:29:51,689
So?

431
00:29:51,905 --> 00:29:53,250
It's not their fingertips.

432
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,738
We have the bastard!

433
00:29:55,858 --> 00:29:57,049
We don't know that yet.

434
00:29:57,169 --> 00:29:57,630
What?

435
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,704
Not everyone has a file.

436
00:29:59,824 --> 00:30:02,131
The subversive who did this has a file.

437
00:30:02,872 --> 00:30:05,504
We arrested him 24 times at protests.

438
00:30:06,667 --> 00:30:07,966
Identity check.

439
00:30:08,504 --> 00:30:09,609
The usual thing.

440
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:14,567
Dear sir, you have broken windows
and burned down cars

441
00:30:15,158 --> 00:30:16,457
you have assaulted guards...

442
00:30:16,753 --> 00:30:18,690
It's your right -
we live in a democracy.

443
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:20,297
So what can we do?

444
00:30:20,708 --> 00:30:24,491
We take your name, fingerprints
and we let you go.

445
00:30:24,861 --> 00:30:28,177
You may continue to break windows
and burn down cars.

446
00:30:28,496 --> 00:30:30,206
Or even kill a policeman.

447
00:30:30,326 --> 00:30:32,968
Or it could be a madman.

448
00:30:33,287 --> 00:30:34,745
Or my grandma in a wheelchair.

449
00:30:35,332 --> 00:30:37,828
We'll get him in under 24 hours.

450
00:30:37,948 --> 00:30:38,865
Way to go!

451
00:31:21,507 --> 00:31:22,591
Don't be afraid.

452
00:31:24,154 --> 00:31:25,188
It hurts.

453
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:26,625
You are scared.

454
00:31:26,745 --> 00:31:27,986
It hurts!

455
00:31:28,742 --> 00:31:30,356
What will I do?

456
00:31:32,552 --> 00:31:34,468
It will be as before between us.

457
00:31:35,527 --> 00:31:36,876
Exactly as before.

458
00:31:41,763 --> 00:31:43,666
We'll be fine together.

459
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:45,267
Yes.

460
00:31:46,225 --> 00:31:47,926
You will let me kiss you.

461
00:31:48,985 --> 00:31:49,931
Touch you.

462
00:31:50,435 --> 00:31:51,103
Yes.

463
00:31:51,773 --> 00:31:52,971
Make love to you.

464
00:31:55,088 --> 00:31:55,744
Yes.

465
00:31:58,038 --> 00:31:59,399
We will live together.

466
00:32:00,609 --> 00:32:01,265
Yes.

467
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,538
People will stop trying
to stab me in the back.

468
00:32:05,658 --> 00:32:06,533
It will be...

469
00:32:08,172 --> 00:32:08,979
...as before.

470
00:32:09,099 --> 00:32:10,305
You get on my nerves!

471
00:32:10,582 --> 00:32:12,045
You say yes
but you mean no.

472
00:32:17,011 --> 00:32:18,095
You know...

473
00:32:19,506 --> 00:32:21,140
I've never stopped loving you.

474
00:32:22,098 --> 00:32:22,980
Never.

475
00:32:24,102 --> 00:32:26,257
At no time, you understand?

476
00:32:27,795 --> 00:32:30,102
I love everything about you...

477
00:32:31,033 --> 00:32:32,357
...everything, you understand?

478
00:32:33,794 --> 00:32:34,890
Your voice...

479
00:32:35,722 --> 00:32:38,647
your eyes, your mouth, your body...

480
00:32:38,975 --> 00:32:40,147
...your movements, everything.

481
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:44,086
When I think about you...

482
00:32:45,057 --> 00:32:46,834
...especially when you're asleep...

483
00:32:48,712 --> 00:32:51,508
...it's crazy how often
I've watched you sleep.

484
00:32:54,609 --> 00:32:56,159
It makes me...

485
00:32:59,474 --> 00:33:01,882
It almost makes me cry.

486
00:33:14,524 --> 00:33:15,823
Where do we eat?

487
00:33:16,135 --> 00:33:17,799
Right after Florence.

488
00:33:19,412 --> 00:33:20,837
Can I put on the radio?

489
00:33:35,442 --> 00:33:36,703
You don't like it?

490
00:33:37,409 --> 00:33:38,947
You don't like the music?

491
00:33:39,211 --> 00:33:40,384
It's fine!

492
00:33:57,215 --> 00:33:58,299
Why didn't you tell me?

493
00:33:59,484 --> 00:34:00,555
What about?

494
00:34:00,791 --> 00:34:02,266
Don't take me for a fool.

495
00:34:03,161 --> 00:34:05,505
Maybe it's not the same van.

496
00:34:05,984 --> 00:34:08,241
A bit too much for a coincidence.

497
00:34:09,078 --> 00:34:09,784
True.

498
00:34:10,591 --> 00:34:11,877
What are you doing?

499
00:34:18,225 --> 00:34:19,964
You think he will stop?

500
00:34:20,469 --> 00:34:22,359
We'll see.

501
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:36,906
What does he want?

502
00:34:38,204 --> 00:34:39,238
I don't know.

503
00:35:31,084 --> 00:35:32,194
What did he say?

504
00:35:51,329 --> 00:35:52,590
Put on your seatbelt.

505
00:35:52,842 --> 00:35:53,838
I already have.

506
00:35:54,279 --> 00:35:55,325
What will you do?

507
00:35:56,296 --> 00:35:57,443
I will try to lose him.

508
00:37:19,785 --> 00:37:22,054
There are speed limits, you know.

509
00:37:34,707 --> 00:37:36,501
What if a tire blows up?

510
00:37:42,424 --> 00:37:45,732
He will have plenty of time
to catch up with us.

511
00:37:45,996 --> 00:37:46,859
I know.

512
00:37:47,267 --> 00:37:48,849
What does he want with us?

513
00:37:49,401 --> 00:37:50,432
I don't know.

514
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:53,524
Do you think he knows us?

515
00:37:54,184 --> 00:37:54,831
No.

516
00:37:55,358 --> 00:37:57,588
Then why is he chasing us?

517
00:37:58,116 --> 00:38:01,053
He needs to chase someone
and he chose us.

518
00:38:01,388 --> 00:38:02,839
You mean, a madman?

519
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:03,904
Yes.

520
00:38:04,659 --> 00:38:06,301
Why not go to the police?

521
00:38:07,308 --> 00:38:09,346
I thought about it.
What will we tell them?

522
00:38:09,466 --> 00:38:11,056
Sir, a guy is following us...

523
00:38:11,176 --> 00:38:12,231
Why not?

524
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:15,611
He didn't do anything to us so far.

525
00:38:15,731 --> 00:38:18,129
There is nothing we can do?

526
00:38:19,001 --> 00:38:19,972
Seems so.

527
00:38:24,095 --> 00:38:25,438
Can we change our route?

528
00:38:25,558 --> 00:38:30,136
Because of some crazy guy
who thinks he's Steve McQueen?

529
00:38:30,651 --> 00:38:32,090
Even if I asked you?

530
00:38:32,849 --> 00:38:33,756
You're scared?

531
00:38:33,876 --> 00:38:34,661
Yes.

532
00:38:37,309 --> 00:38:39,287
So what do you propose?

533
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:41,912
Take the first exit...

534
00:38:42,323 --> 00:38:43,258
at Cusi.

535
00:38:43,918 --> 00:38:45,980
You go all the way to Sienna.

536
00:38:46,543 --> 00:38:49,744
At Sienna get back on the highway...

537
00:38:49,864 --> 00:38:52,130
...and ride up to Florence.
Easy, no?

538
00:38:53,003 --> 00:38:54,034
That's your plan?

539
00:38:54,154 --> 00:38:54,838
Yes.

540
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:56,641
Fine.

541
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,530
Say goodbye to our friend.

542
00:39:13,841 --> 00:39:15,208
He was going to Paris...

543
00:39:15,328 --> 00:39:17,198
...he was handsome...

544
00:39:17,505 --> 00:39:19,328
...and he was scared?

545
00:39:20,406 --> 00:39:22,504
Of what was he scared?

546
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:23,931
Of women.

547
00:39:24,183 --> 00:39:26,784
What women?
You mean, of you?

548
00:39:26,904 --> 00:39:27,599
Yes.

549
00:39:29,805 --> 00:39:30,931
A fag?

550
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:33,305
Not necessarily.

551
00:39:33,425 --> 00:39:36,590
Some frustrated type
who eats his own shit in the mornings.

552
00:39:36,913 --> 00:39:38,196
What else can you report?

553
00:39:39,548 --> 00:39:40,711
Light hair...

554
00:39:41,251 --> 00:39:44,781
...dark glasses, checked shirt...
You didn't see his car!

555
00:39:46,057 --> 00:39:47,387
He wasn't a fag.

556
00:39:47,507 --> 00:39:49,018
How do you know?

557
00:39:49,663 --> 00:39:52,493
Because when I looked down, I saw...

558
00:39:55,058 --> 00:39:55,885
What?

559
00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:58,064
He was hard.

560
00:39:58,820 --> 00:39:59,791
Come in.

561
00:40:01,673 --> 00:40:03,387
Enough ma'm, you may go.

562
00:40:03,903 --> 00:40:04,970
Goodbye.

563
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,415
Well?

564
00:40:07,535 --> 00:40:08,293
No luck...

565
00:40:08,413 --> 00:40:09,480
He doesn't have a file.

566
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,553
We've just received a telex.

567
00:40:11,937 --> 00:40:13,268
He's doesn't have a file?

568
00:40:13,651 --> 00:40:14,736
Nothing at all?

569
00:40:19,301 --> 00:40:21,387
Did the lady report anything?

570
00:40:21,999 --> 00:40:23,605
She said he had a hard-on.

571
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:51,846
It's the clutch?

572
00:40:52,798 --> 00:40:53,494
Yes.

573
00:40:54,069 --> 00:40:55,232
Do you have a carjack?

574
00:40:56,321 --> 00:40:57,146
Can I use your garage?

575
00:40:57,266 --> 00:40:59,016
Yes, but there is no mechanic.

576
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:00,618
I don't need one.

577
00:41:09,156 --> 00:41:10,657
Do you have a size 11 wrench?

578
00:41:10,777 --> 00:41:11,501
Sure.

579
00:41:14,336 --> 00:41:15,007
Here.

580
00:41:15,459 --> 00:41:16,238
Thank you.

581
00:41:17,125 --> 00:41:18,216
You're French?

582
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:18,959
Yes.

583
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:19,738
Where from?

584
00:41:19,858 --> 00:41:20,577
Paris.

585
00:41:21,128 --> 00:41:22,027
You're going there?

586
00:41:22,363 --> 00:41:23,034
Yes.

587
00:41:23,538 --> 00:41:25,312
I am going to join my wife.

588
00:41:25,766 --> 00:41:26,857
She's already there.

589
00:41:28,991 --> 00:41:30,322
And my son.

590
00:41:30,442 --> 00:41:31,544
You have a son?

591
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:34,469
No, but it's as if I did.

592
00:41:36,468 --> 00:41:37,583
It's her boy.

593
00:41:38,554 --> 00:41:40,208
From her first marriage.

594
00:41:41,167 --> 00:41:42,402
He's almost 12 years old.

595
00:41:42,905 --> 00:41:44,224
They're sweet at that age.

596
00:41:49,287 --> 00:41:51,547
I bet it's going to rain before tonight.

597
00:41:52,865 --> 00:41:53,753
No way.

598
00:41:56,867 --> 00:41:57,946
About the detour...

599
00:41:58,642 --> 00:42:00,236
You added only 25 km...

600
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,819
...before going back to the highway.

601
00:42:05,077 --> 00:42:05,820
So what?

602
00:42:06,767 --> 00:42:09,584
You never intended
to lose him for long.

603
00:42:10,543 --> 00:42:11,251
Never.

604
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:14,761
You are a liar.

605
00:42:16,175 --> 00:42:17,638
I am a liar indeed.

606
00:42:19,088 --> 00:42:20,611
We'll be in France tonight.

607
00:42:20,863 --> 00:42:22,948
Tonight we'll make it to the border.

608
00:42:26,505 --> 00:42:28,495
Tonight, when we talk to mom...

609
00:42:28,615 --> 00:42:29,874
...we should not tell her.

610
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:30,941
Really?

611
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:34,416
I was planning to tell her everything.

612
00:42:41,162 --> 00:42:42,649
Do you often see your father?

613
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,147
Almost never.

614
00:42:44,267 --> 00:42:45,274
It's better that way.

615
00:42:46,341 --> 00:42:46,988
Why?

616
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:49,146
Because he has his family.

617
00:42:49,266 --> 00:42:51,112
Children from his new marriage.

618
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:53,424
When I get there, it's a pain.

619
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,187
What do you mean?

620
00:42:56,565 --> 00:42:58,471
I remind him of a previous marriage...

621
00:42:58,591 --> 00:42:59,910
...and everyone gets upset.

622
00:43:01,709 --> 00:43:03,219
You've been married before?

623
00:43:03,339 --> 00:43:04,058
Yes.

624
00:43:05,209 --> 00:43:06,528
It didn't work out?

625
00:43:06,648 --> 00:43:07,247
It did.

626
00:43:08,769 --> 00:43:10,304
Why did you get a divorce then?

627
00:43:11,549 --> 00:43:12,652
I didn't.

628
00:43:14,222 --> 00:43:15,241
I don't understand.

629
00:43:15,361 --> 00:43:16,308
She died.

630
00:43:19,193 --> 00:43:21,482
Tell me if you need to go
to the bathroom.

631
00:43:21,914 --> 00:43:23,880
I am fine but I feel it coming soon...

632
00:43:30,442 --> 00:43:31,653
I don't understand.

633
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,134
You're not alone, little guy.

634
00:43:40,924 --> 00:43:42,015
Why are you laughing?

635
00:43:42,135 --> 00:43:43,741
Because they don't know
what to think.

636
00:43:44,916 --> 00:43:47,697
Even if they had discovered
that I know their hotels...

637
00:43:47,817 --> 00:43:50,910
...they have to get
to their planned destination.

638
00:43:51,737 --> 00:43:53,367
I did all I had to do.

639
00:43:54,374 --> 00:43:55,549
Why tonight?

640
00:43:55,801 --> 00:43:57,875
It's less risky at the hotel.

641
00:43:58,102 --> 00:43:59,169
It's better.

642
00:44:00,317 --> 00:44:01,791
Isn't that clever?

643
00:44:02,487 --> 00:44:03,637
I am clever, huh?

644
00:44:04,824 --> 00:44:05,496
You are.

645
00:44:06,802 --> 00:44:08,373
You should not have left me.

646
00:44:09,636 --> 00:44:12,429
Say it,
that you never should've left...

647
00:44:12,933 --> 00:44:14,527
I should never have left you.

648
00:44:15,384 --> 00:44:17,914
You should never have
moved to Paris.

649
00:44:55,812 --> 00:44:58,941
Lucky you parked near the motel!

650
00:44:59,061 --> 00:45:01,314
I didn't know it was the entrance
of the restaurant.

651
00:45:05,095 --> 00:45:06,869
You look funny.

652
00:45:06,989 --> 00:45:08,248
Did you see yourself?

653
00:45:48,004 --> 00:45:48,759
Hello?

654
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:49,551
3606 ?

655
00:45:49,671 --> 00:45:50,246
Yes!

656
00:45:50,366 --> 00:45:51,660
Hold the line.

657
00:45:52,942 --> 00:45:53,674
Mom?

658
00:45:53,946 --> 00:45:54,881
Marc?

659
00:45:55,109 --> 00:45:56,368
How are you?

660
00:45:56,715 --> 00:45:58,106
Did you arrive safely?

661
00:45:58,525 --> 00:45:59,317
Yeah.

662
00:45:59,988 --> 00:46:01,319
Without a problem.

663
00:46:05,024 --> 00:46:06,763
You're not very talkative...

664
00:46:07,338 --> 00:46:08,165
Me?

665
00:46:08,813 --> 00:46:10,443
Do you have a headache?

666
00:46:11,294 --> 00:46:12,745
Did you catch a cold?

667
00:46:14,774 --> 00:46:16,872
Give me Alex.
Kisses!

668
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:19,210
Kisses. Here he is.

669
00:46:21,236 --> 00:46:22,087
Nicole?

670
00:46:22,518 --> 00:46:23,729
What is going on?

671
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:28,008
Nothing! We drove all day,
we are both tired.

672
00:46:28,363 --> 00:46:29,706
What's up with you?

673
00:46:30,299 --> 00:46:33,595
The furniture arrived.
The couch doesn't open.

674
00:46:34,003 --> 00:46:35,909
We'll need more furniture though.

675
00:46:36,868 --> 00:46:40,752
There's a bed, a table, chairs...
You'll see.

676
00:46:41,243 --> 00:46:42,382
I miss you.

677
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:43,749
Me too.

678
00:46:43,869 --> 00:46:44,840
I love you.

679
00:46:45,691 --> 00:46:46,638
Me too.

680
00:46:48,573 --> 00:46:50,312
All I do is wait.

681
00:46:51,079 --> 00:46:52,350
I wish you'd arrived already.

682
00:46:52,685 --> 00:46:53,608
Me too!

683
00:46:53,728 --> 00:46:56,497
Don't say the same thing all the time.

684
00:46:56,903 --> 00:46:57,742
Wait...

685
00:46:57,970 --> 00:46:59,361
Why don't you go take a leak?

686
00:46:59,481 --> 00:47:00,901
Why?
I don't need to!

687
00:47:01,021 --> 00:47:03,059
Maybe you could try?

688
00:47:03,765 --> 00:47:06,606
Are you insane?
I am old enough to know when to go.

689
00:47:09,315 --> 00:47:11,425
Ah, now I understand!

690
00:47:11,874 --> 00:47:13,277
Don't be too long, ok?

691
00:47:16,525 --> 00:47:17,532
Come on!

692
00:47:24,423 --> 00:47:25,466
Still there?

693
00:47:26,639 --> 00:47:28,521
I got rid of your creature.

694
00:47:28,641 --> 00:47:30,056
What do you mean "my creature"?

695
00:47:31,291 --> 00:47:34,156
Alex, home is empty without you two.

696
00:47:34,741 --> 00:47:36,359
I want you so much...

697
00:47:37,042 --> 00:47:37,989
Me too.

698
00:47:38,289 --> 00:47:39,392
Here you go again.

699
00:47:39,704 --> 00:47:43,336
What good it did to get rid of the boy.

700
00:47:44,837 --> 00:47:46,563
Sorry, I am doing my best.

701
00:47:48,769 --> 00:47:49,980
I want you...

702
00:47:50,448 --> 00:47:51,491
Me too...

703
00:47:59,274 --> 00:48:01,660
Is it true that all is well
with the kid?

704
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:03,746
He's perfectly OK,
why?

705
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:06,539
There was something in his voice...

706
00:48:06,997 --> 00:48:08,951
Maybe I am getting ideas...

707
00:48:09,443 --> 00:48:12,691
No need to worry,
he's doing very well.

708
00:48:14,993 --> 00:48:16,072
Good night.

709
00:48:16,388 --> 00:48:17,371
Kisses.

710
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:19,193
Kisses.

711
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:22,670
See you tomorrow.

712
00:48:39,386 --> 00:48:40,717
Are you asleep?

713
00:48:41,101 --> 00:48:41,820
Yes.

714
00:48:42,671 --> 00:48:44,134
You should be too.

715
00:48:46,172 --> 00:48:48,497
She sensed there was something wrong.

716
00:48:51,093 --> 00:48:54,606
It's always been that way.
I could never hide anything from her.

717
00:48:55,085 --> 00:48:56,943
I wonder how she does it.

718
00:48:57,351 --> 00:48:58,765
She doesn't know herself.

719
00:48:58,885 --> 00:48:59,740
What?

720
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,389
She doesn't know
how she does it.

721
00:49:04,176 --> 00:49:06,106
An animal in the woods...

722
00:49:07,172 --> 00:49:10,228
Suddenly, it raises its head
and runs to hide...

723
00:49:11,056 --> 00:49:13,237
Way before anything happens...

724
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:16,510
Because it senses danger.

725
00:49:19,015 --> 00:49:22,396
This can't be explained,
it just knows by instinct.

726
00:49:22,803 --> 00:49:25,379
But she's 1500 km away from here...

727
00:49:26,626 --> 00:49:27,717
You see...

728
00:49:29,683 --> 00:49:31,852
it's the same thing - she just knows.

729
00:49:34,308 --> 00:49:35,111
Say...

730
00:49:37,399 --> 00:49:39,020
Do you think we lost him?

731
00:49:41,069 --> 00:49:41,764
Yes.

732
00:49:45,181 --> 00:49:47,627
The last time we also believed that.

733
00:49:48,706 --> 00:49:50,240
This time we lost him.

734
00:49:50,761 --> 00:49:51,732
Go to sleep.

735
00:49:53,794 --> 00:49:55,412
What did he want from us?

736
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:57,702
We'll never know.

737
00:49:59,225 --> 00:50:00,567
Go to sleep, kid.

738
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:02,119
Yes, sir.

739
00:50:06,866 --> 00:50:08,485
It's raining buckets...

740
00:50:29,449 --> 00:50:30,792
They're all dead...

741
00:50:49,888 --> 00:50:52,369
This is a cartridge from the mother's room.

742
00:51:24,864 --> 00:51:28,245
I am looking for a guy
who killed two policemen.

743
00:51:28,365 --> 00:51:29,360
There's no connection.

744
00:51:30,354 --> 00:51:31,468
How do you know?

745
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:33,003
This is a family murder.

746
00:51:33,123 --> 00:51:34,190
A father...

747
00:51:34,681 --> 00:51:35,604
Father?

748
00:51:36,168 --> 00:51:37,846
A father killed his entire family?

749
00:51:37,966 --> 00:51:40,722
His children, his wife...
and himself.

750
00:51:41,297 --> 00:51:42,065
Why?

751
00:51:42,796 --> 00:51:45,505
He left a note...
of religious character.

752
00:51:45,625 --> 00:51:50,777
His son was a junkie, his daughter a slut -
and the wife gave birth to that.

753
00:51:51,856 --> 00:51:53,247
Couldn't it be true?

754
00:51:54,086 --> 00:51:54,937
Sure.

755
00:52:05,105 --> 00:52:06,580
A cutie, eh?

756
00:52:08,042 --> 00:52:09,876
My daughter is her age...

757
00:53:01,930 --> 00:53:02,745
Alex!

758
00:53:11,179 --> 00:53:12,006
Alex!

759
00:53:13,995 --> 00:53:17,040
Someone is trying to force the lock.

760
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:18,088
Listen!

761
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:20,366
Do you hear?

762
00:53:20,979 --> 00:53:22,046
It must be him.

763
00:53:48,837 --> 00:53:51,630
Lock the door
and don't let anyone in!

764
00:53:52,798 --> 00:53:53,697
Got that?

765
00:53:55,053 --> 00:53:56,299
When I am back...

766
00:53:56,707 --> 00:53:58,697
Make me talk
to make sure it's me.

767
00:53:59,177 --> 00:53:59,836
Ok.

768
00:54:00,410 --> 00:54:02,017
Lock the door after me.

769
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:03,971
I must hear it.

770
00:54:04,474 --> 00:54:05,649
Be careful, Alex!

771
00:56:12,106 --> 00:56:13,436
What do you want?

772
00:56:14,359 --> 00:56:15,318
Who are you?

773
00:56:16,601 --> 00:56:17,920
What do you want?

774
00:57:27,941 --> 00:57:31,537
If I understood correctly,
you have no explanation to offer?

775
00:57:31,657 --> 00:57:32,628
None at all.

776
00:57:33,226 --> 00:57:35,875
You have never seen that man before,

777
00:57:35,995 --> 00:57:37,602
and don't know who he might be.

778
00:57:38,092 --> 00:57:39,867
For the fifth time : no!

779
00:57:40,599 --> 00:57:42,733
You don't make things easy for me.

780
00:57:43,297 --> 00:57:44,376
I'll be going.

781
00:57:44,867 --> 00:57:46,629
What will you do?

782
00:57:46,749 --> 00:57:48,811
The usual : search for the suspect.

783
00:57:48,931 --> 00:57:49,746
What do you want?

784
00:57:49,866 --> 00:57:50,993
I want police protection.

785
00:57:51,455 --> 00:57:54,488
I want an agent next to our door
until we depart.

786
00:57:54,608 --> 00:57:58,239
I want motorcyclists
to escort us to the border.

787
00:57:58,359 --> 00:57:59,174
But...

788
00:57:59,294 --> 00:58:00,277
No buts!

789
00:58:00,726 --> 00:58:02,177
We'll do our best.

790
00:58:02,464 --> 00:58:03,208
Thanks.

791
00:58:04,310 --> 00:58:05,389
Feeling better?

792
00:58:06,287 --> 00:58:07,929
Take this for pain.

793
00:58:08,169 --> 00:58:11,298
Not more than twice a day.
Do not leave too early.

794
00:58:11,418 --> 00:58:12,665
Thank you doctor.

795
00:58:16,176 --> 00:58:17,267
So, kid?

796
00:58:17,650 --> 00:58:18,897
Don't look sour!

797
00:58:19,490 --> 00:58:20,761
I am still here!

798
00:58:59,939 --> 00:59:00,874
Mister Moineau?

799
00:59:00,994 --> 00:59:01,630
Yes.

800
00:59:01,941 --> 00:59:03,644
Inspector Boetani, federal police.

801
00:59:03,764 --> 00:59:05,514
We've already seen policemen...

802
00:59:06,346 --> 00:59:08,660
I know.
I drove 700 km to talk to you.

803
00:59:09,691 --> 00:59:10,938
Two policemen have been...

804
00:59:13,486 --> 00:59:16,519
Two policemen were shot
on the highway yesterday.

805
00:59:16,986 --> 00:59:18,748
You think it's the same guy?

806
00:59:19,312 --> 00:59:20,618
I know it.

807
00:59:21,158 --> 00:59:22,465
Everything fits.

808
00:59:23,051 --> 00:59:25,017
Because if it was different guys...

809
00:59:25,251 --> 00:59:28,440
...who could possibly believe that.

810
00:59:31,194 --> 00:59:32,237
Your son?

811
00:59:32,357 --> 00:59:33,544
My wife's son.

812
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:37,764
Please, take a seat.

813
00:59:42,013 --> 00:59:44,051
What would you like to know?

814
00:59:44,435 --> 00:59:46,137
Why was he following you?

815
00:59:46,461 --> 00:59:48,127
Why did he try to kill you?

816
00:59:48,247 --> 00:59:49,314
I don't know.

817
00:59:49,636 --> 00:59:51,554
I've never seen this man before.

818
00:59:51,674 --> 00:59:52,813
Are you sure?

819
00:59:52,933 --> 00:59:53,868
Positive.

820
00:59:55,464 --> 00:59:56,663
And the kid?

821
00:59:56,927 --> 00:59:58,521
The kid didn't see him.

822
00:59:59,671 --> 01:00:03,615
It's not because you don't know him
that he doesn't know you.

823
01:00:04,274 --> 01:00:05,533
What do you mean?

824
01:00:07,126 --> 01:00:08,696
May I see your passport?

825
01:00:08,816 --> 01:00:10,123
I've already...

826
01:00:10,243 --> 01:00:11,789
Please!

827
01:00:41,116 --> 01:00:44,054
In the last eight years...

828
01:00:44,293 --> 01:00:46,175
...you've been...

829
01:00:47,182 --> 01:00:50,060
...13 times to Algeria.

830
01:00:50,650 --> 01:00:54,439
I work for a company
that does business there.

831
01:00:57,069 --> 01:01:00,126
Are you involved with politics,
Mister Moineau?

832
01:01:00,527 --> 01:01:01,894
What do you mean?

833
01:01:03,002 --> 01:01:06,467
Do you have party membership,
a right-wing party?

834
01:01:07,755 --> 01:01:08,462
No.

835
01:01:09,122 --> 01:01:10,248
What's the connection?

836
01:01:10,368 --> 01:01:11,687
Are you sure?

837
01:01:12,453 --> 01:01:14,611
Where were you
during the Algerian war?

838
01:01:15,078 --> 01:01:16,637
In Paris, and in Rome.

839
01:01:16,978 --> 01:01:18,836
Forgive me for insisting...

840
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:22,055
...what about OAS?
Not even a little?

841
01:01:22,546 --> 01:01:24,668
This conversation is getting...

842
01:01:26,946 --> 01:01:28,180
Don't get upset.

843
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:30,954
I was in Paris in 1960.

844
01:01:32,069 --> 01:01:33,604
I remember it all.

845
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:36,007
And I am not alone.

846
01:01:37,858 --> 01:01:41,298
You said an unknown man
tried to kill you.

847
01:01:41,418 --> 01:01:43,120
I am trying to understand why.

848
01:01:43,791 --> 01:01:45,254
What if there's no reason?

849
01:01:45,374 --> 01:01:46,525
It's possible.

850
01:01:47,309 --> 01:01:48,832
Everything is possible.

851
01:01:50,023 --> 01:01:51,136
But it's improbable.

852
01:01:51,411 --> 01:01:52,981
Why kill the policemen?

853
01:01:53,101 --> 01:01:54,000
Who knows!

854
01:01:54,802 --> 01:01:56,732
I was counting on you to tell me.

855
01:01:56,852 --> 01:01:59,021
I've never seen this guy before.

856
01:01:59,261 --> 01:02:00,615
I don't do politics.

857
01:02:00,735 --> 01:02:02,138
I have no enemies.

858
01:02:02,258 --> 01:02:05,062
And I don't understand
why he tried to kill me.

859
01:02:06,045 --> 01:02:09,353
Violence doesn't just happen
one fine morning.

860
01:02:10,276 --> 01:02:13,002
And God has not chosen you
out of the blue.

861
01:02:14,998 --> 01:02:17,731
I will be able to offer you protection...

862
01:02:18,185 --> 01:02:20,404
once I know what's it about.

863
01:02:21,074 --> 01:02:24,443
I am sorry, inspector,
but I have a long way to go tomorrow....

864
01:02:24,903 --> 01:02:26,917
and I need to rest.

865
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:28,787
Mister Moineau!

866
01:02:30,561 --> 01:02:32,539
Have you ever been incarcerated?

867
01:02:34,891 --> 01:02:35,886
You never know.

868
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:39,314
You're not sleeping?

869
01:02:39,902 --> 01:02:41,220
I was listening to you.

870
01:02:44,325 --> 01:02:45,236
Back to bed!

871
01:02:53,472 --> 01:02:55,557
He has a point, you know...

872
01:02:55,953 --> 01:02:56,960
How so?

873
01:02:57,931 --> 01:03:00,436
It's true that we weren't chosen
by chance.

874
01:03:01,335 --> 01:03:02,486
There must be a reason.

875
01:03:04,702 --> 01:03:05,457
I know.

876
01:03:17,650 --> 01:03:18,465
Slept well?

877
01:03:18,585 --> 01:03:19,185
No.

878
01:03:19,940 --> 01:03:21,894
Where are the motorcyclists?

879
01:03:22,014 --> 01:03:22,973
Motorcyclists?

880
01:03:23,284 --> 01:03:25,706
I asked to be escorted to the border.

881
01:03:26,123 --> 01:03:27,526
Yes of course.

882
01:03:27,849 --> 01:03:28,689
I cancelled them.

883
01:03:29,084 --> 01:03:30,283
What do you mean?

884
01:03:30,403 --> 01:03:31,769
You didn't tell me anything.

885
01:03:31,889 --> 01:03:34,165
Give me a reason
and I'll protect you.

886
01:03:34,285 --> 01:03:35,568
You get nothing
if you give nothing.

887
01:03:36,515 --> 01:03:37,210
Fine!

888
01:03:37,330 --> 01:03:38,661
I'll call my embassy.

889
01:03:38,781 --> 01:03:40,003
It's useless.

890
01:03:41,465 --> 01:03:42,220
He's dead.

891
01:03:43,647 --> 01:03:44,462
The ambassador?

892
01:03:45,217 --> 01:03:46,967
The guy who followed you.

893
01:03:47,339 --> 01:03:48,646
We found his car.

894
01:03:48,905 --> 01:03:51,422
Not far from here at 6 am,
burned.

895
01:03:52,609 --> 01:03:54,288
The guy burned inside.

896
01:03:54,959 --> 01:03:56,098
Are you sure of that?

897
01:03:56,326 --> 01:03:57,261
Absolutely.

898
01:03:58,399 --> 01:03:59,814
You should have said so.

899
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:02,110
I wanted to surprise you.

900
01:04:05,515 --> 01:04:08,047
You still don't want to tell me
why he followed you?

901
01:04:16,648 --> 01:04:17,355
Know what?

902
01:04:17,907 --> 01:04:19,034
I am so relieved.

903
01:04:19,154 --> 01:04:20,400
You bet. Me too!

904
01:04:21,947 --> 01:04:25,028
A guy dies and we're happy?
Not nice but...

905
01:04:25,148 --> 01:04:26,737
It's just the way it is.

906
01:04:26,857 --> 01:04:28,500
Coming back from Saint-Malo...

907
01:04:29,998 --> 01:04:31,521
I met three camels...

908
01:04:33,052 --> 01:04:34,706
I put them in my bed...

909
01:04:36,037 --> 01:04:38,201
And, mom, I loved some tit...

910
01:04:39,088 --> 01:04:42,468
They have round hats,
long live Bretons!

911
01:04:45,748 --> 01:04:47,354
Coming back from Saint-Martin...

912
01:04:48,739 --> 01:04:50,381
I found three little rabbits...

913
01:04:51,579 --> 01:04:53,353
I put them inside my slip...

914
01:04:54,839 --> 01:04:57,453
And they ate my little carrot.

915
01:05:04,757 --> 01:05:06,543
Coming back from Saint-Quentin...

916
01:05:08,376 --> 01:05:10,821
I found three little sluts...

917
01:05:13,553 --> 01:05:17,030
I put them in my pocket...

918
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:19,089
And they ate my little noodle...

919
01:06:03,017 --> 01:06:04,228
Personal belongings?

920
01:06:04,348 --> 01:06:06,422
All the papers were burnt.

921
01:06:07,727 --> 01:06:10,053
A watch, two rings, a bracelet.

922
01:06:12,295 --> 01:06:13,846
I knew it was a fag.

923
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:28,718
Ah you were good looking
in your youth!

924
01:06:28,838 --> 01:06:30,048
Don't push it.

925
01:06:30,875 --> 01:06:32,973
You didn't wear glasses.

926
01:06:33,089 --> 01:06:35,462
I took them off for the photo.

927
01:06:35,738 --> 01:06:36,697
Why?

928
01:06:36,937 --> 01:06:38,220
You don't like glasses?

929
01:06:38,340 --> 01:06:39,251
No reason.

930
01:06:39,634 --> 01:06:42,499
We'll see what we can do
about contact lenses.

931
01:06:42,989 --> 01:06:44,224
It must be possible.

932
01:06:44,344 --> 01:06:45,686
Passports please.

933
01:07:00,417 --> 01:07:01,244
Easy!

934
01:07:03,570 --> 01:07:04,397
Good!

935
01:07:15,074 --> 01:07:17,843
A potato baked in the ashes.
You like?

936
01:07:19,329 --> 01:07:22,254
It's from this car's blaze.

937
01:07:22,542 --> 01:07:23,585
A homosexual farmer!

938
01:07:24,024 --> 01:07:26,134
We're dealing with a rustic fag.

939
01:07:40,566 --> 01:07:43,096
How long is this tunnel?

940
01:07:43,216 --> 01:07:44,486
I've no idea.

941
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:49,099
Do you have a trip counter?

942
01:07:49,219 --> 01:07:49,890
I do.

943
01:07:50,190 --> 01:07:51,377
Switch it on.

944
01:07:51,844 --> 01:07:52,587
Done.

945
01:07:52,851 --> 01:07:53,701
What now?

946
01:07:53,821 --> 01:07:55,811
I will bet on 20 km.

947
01:07:56,326 --> 01:07:57,225
How much?

948
01:07:57,345 --> 01:07:58,352
Fifty francs.

949
01:07:58,592 --> 01:07:59,587
Old money?

950
01:07:59,707 --> 01:08:00,977
You must be kidding.

951
01:08:01,097 --> 01:08:02,116
I accept.

952
01:08:04,860 --> 01:08:08,504
Did you ask about the tunnel
to test me or because you didn't know?

953
01:08:09,066 --> 01:08:10,265
What do you mean?

954
01:08:10,385 --> 01:08:11,919
You might have read about it.

955
01:08:12,171 --> 01:08:13,610
That wouldn't be fair play.

956
01:08:13,730 --> 01:08:14,772
Oh really?

957
01:08:14,892 --> 01:08:16,475
I swear I didn't know...

958
01:08:18,811 --> 01:08:22,724
Take off your seatbelt!
Lie down in the back!

959
01:08:29,275 --> 01:08:30,593
Between the seats!

960
01:08:46,130 --> 01:08:47,305
Don't look!

961
01:09:10,841 --> 01:09:12,207
Stay down!

962
01:10:00,923 --> 01:10:01,966
Stay down!

963
01:11:24,721 --> 01:11:26,075
Stay down!

964
01:11:32,850 --> 01:11:33,870
Marc, lie down!

965
01:12:38,578 --> 01:12:42,978
It was a Ford van.
They thought it was him...

966
01:12:43,601 --> 01:12:44,488
and we left.

967
01:12:44,608 --> 01:12:45,590
Incredible!

968
01:12:49,546 --> 01:12:51,680
How come the plates are from Rome?

969
01:12:51,991 --> 01:12:54,137
It's my wife's car,
she lived there.

970
01:12:56,078 --> 01:12:57,025
Incredible!

971
01:12:58,343 --> 01:12:59,722
It's your daughter?

972
01:13:00,010 --> 01:13:01,592
It's my wife's son.

973
01:13:02,694 --> 01:13:04,469
Hard to know these days.

974
01:13:04,589 --> 01:13:09,959
You think a girl is speeding,
you stop them and it's boys!

975
01:13:10,079 --> 01:13:11,193
You're ok?

976
01:13:12,699 --> 01:13:14,282
You got off easy...

977
01:13:15,085 --> 01:13:16,404
What a sight!

978
01:13:16,967 --> 01:13:18,646
Come to the office.

979
01:13:36,651 --> 01:13:37,933
Do you have insurance?

980
01:13:39,012 --> 01:13:40,127
For road accidents.

981
01:13:40,570 --> 01:13:42,910
What's the connection?
You've spoken to Italian police...

982
01:13:43,170 --> 01:13:45,430
They've confirmed your story.

983
01:13:46,131 --> 01:13:46,887
So?

984
01:13:47,774 --> 01:13:50,829
They've closed your file.

985
01:13:50,949 --> 01:13:52,030
The guy is dead.

986
01:13:52,290 --> 01:13:56,044
But he just attacked us!
The kid is my witness.

987
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:59,014
Italian police saw him dead.

988
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:02,501
You left and now
you got into an accident.

989
01:14:02,788 --> 01:14:06,037
I don't want to get involved in your
insurance schemes.

990
01:14:06,157 --> 01:14:07,350
Give me that phone.

991
01:14:07,610 --> 01:14:08,230
Why?

992
01:14:08,490 --> 01:14:09,150
To call the police.

993
01:14:09,410 --> 01:14:10,219
I am the police!

994
01:14:10,339 --> 01:14:11,087
You're incompetent!

995
01:14:11,207 --> 01:14:13,123
Don't touch the phone!

996
01:14:13,356 --> 01:14:14,769
I will call from elsewhere!

997
01:14:14,889 --> 01:14:16,783
No one will believe you!
You know it.

998
01:14:16,903 --> 01:14:19,194
Or they will refer you back to me...

999
01:14:19,314 --> 01:14:21,628
Because it happened in my district!

1000
01:14:21,748 --> 01:14:25,512
If it wasn't for your daughter,
I'd arrest you to calm you down!

1001
01:14:25,632 --> 01:14:29,276
You can call the Prefect
or the Pope!

1002
01:14:29,396 --> 01:14:31,732
You'll still have to deal with me!

1003
01:14:33,854 --> 01:14:34,777
Let's go!

1004
01:14:39,407 --> 01:14:40,834
Look at him!

1005
01:14:42,464 --> 01:14:43,411
You'll leave it there?

1006
01:14:43,663 --> 01:14:46,731
What else can we do?
No one will believe us.

1007
01:14:47,905 --> 01:14:48,684
Let's go!

1008
01:14:49,212 --> 01:14:51,130
We need a new windshield.

1009
01:15:21,556 --> 01:15:22,647
Do they have one?

1010
01:15:22,767 --> 01:15:23,762
Out of stock.

1011
01:15:26,115 --> 01:15:27,530
What are you doing?

1012
01:15:27,781 --> 01:15:29,292
We need to be warm.

1013
01:15:31,510 --> 01:15:32,157
Here!

1014
01:15:34,183 --> 01:15:35,514
Put that on too.

1015
01:16:14,811 --> 01:16:15,554
Hello?

1016
01:16:15,674 --> 01:16:16,585
Nicole!

1017
01:16:17,938 --> 01:16:18,981
I have great news!

1018
01:16:19,736 --> 01:16:20,588
Me too!

1019
01:16:21,091 --> 01:16:22,110
Tell me first!

1020
01:16:22,348 --> 01:16:23,523
No, you go first.

1021
01:16:24,170 --> 01:16:27,263
I am starting work on the 1st,
we'll have 8 days together.

1022
01:16:27,767 --> 01:16:28,798
Are you happy?

1023
01:16:28,918 --> 01:16:29,685
Very!

1024
01:16:30,115 --> 01:16:31,158
Listen...

1025
01:16:31,278 --> 01:16:33,448
Hey there guys!

1026
01:16:33,568 --> 01:16:36,229
What's that?
You're not at a hotel?

1027
01:16:36,683 --> 01:16:38,349
That's the thing...

1028
01:16:38,817 --> 01:16:41,694
We decided to go directly to Paris.

1029
01:16:41,814 --> 01:16:44,174
I thought you didn't want
to drive at night.

1030
01:16:45,109 --> 01:16:47,735
We miss you too much.

1031
01:16:47,855 --> 01:16:50,528
And I'm not at all sleepy.

1032
01:16:50,827 --> 01:16:53,908
We should get there at 3am.

1033
01:16:55,825 --> 01:16:56,903
What do you say?

1034
01:16:58,282 --> 01:17:01,159
The boy will sleep in the car.

1035
01:17:01,702 --> 01:17:04,184
It's true he can sleep anywhere.

1036
01:17:04,304 --> 01:17:05,526
Precisely.

1037
01:17:06,388 --> 01:17:08,176
I'll warm the bed for you...

1038
01:17:08,486 --> 01:17:10,464
I'll put the kid on...

1039
01:17:10,584 --> 01:17:12,921
You always flee
when I become tender...

1040
01:17:15,618 --> 01:17:16,590
Mom?

1041
01:17:17,359 --> 01:17:18,354
How are you?

1042
01:17:19,050 --> 01:17:21,327
So you confirm he's not sleepy?

1043
01:17:21,447 --> 01:17:23,221
We're both in top shape!

1044
01:17:23,647 --> 01:17:24,857
Don't worry!

1045
01:17:24,977 --> 01:17:26,020
Be careful!

1046
01:17:26,140 --> 01:17:28,502
I'll scold him if he takes risks.

1047
01:17:31,751 --> 01:17:32,566
Bye mom!

1048
01:17:33,717 --> 01:17:35,551
Many kisses!
Bye mom.

1049
01:17:42,535 --> 01:17:43,314
You're done?

1050
01:17:43,709 --> 01:17:44,548
Done.

1051
01:17:46,395 --> 01:17:47,246
Hot chocolate...

1052
01:17:48,228 --> 01:17:49,211
One coffee...

1053
01:17:50,104 --> 01:17:51,254
Call to Paris...

1054
01:17:52,902 --> 01:17:54,460
Can I ask you something?

1055
01:17:55,562 --> 01:17:57,048
Why drive all night?

1056
01:17:57,168 --> 01:17:59,710
The sooner we get to Paris,
the better.

1057
01:17:59,830 --> 01:18:01,530
That's the only reason?

1058
01:18:01,650 --> 01:18:03,796
Yes.
Can you think of another?

1059
01:18:04,755 --> 01:18:06,146
Try again!

1060
01:18:08,266 --> 01:18:09,129
Come in!

1061
01:18:10,861 --> 01:18:12,275
You know,
that fag of yours...

1062
01:18:13,197 --> 01:18:15,151
I have the proof
it is not him.

1063
01:18:15,271 --> 01:18:16,002
Not him?

1064
01:18:16,122 --> 01:18:19,095
We found a finger
less damaged by the fire.

1065
01:18:19,215 --> 01:18:21,229
The fingertips don't match.

1066
01:18:22,031 --> 01:18:27,365
Connect me to the police of
Grenoble, Lyon, Vintimille, Dijon, Paris...

1067
01:18:27,845 --> 01:18:29,715
and Interpol in Rome!

1068
01:18:45,653 --> 01:18:46,972
Don't fall asleep!

1069
01:18:57,222 --> 01:18:58,361
Let's try singing...

1070
01:18:58,820 --> 01:18:59,527
No.

1071
01:19:00,223 --> 01:19:02,189
I can't, I am too cold.

1072
01:19:04,478 --> 01:19:05,479
Please repeat...

1073
01:19:05,599 --> 01:19:08,320
I don't have the man's description
or the car's number.

1074
01:19:08,846 --> 01:19:11,639
But a Mister Moineau
is driving to Paris...

1075
01:19:12,441 --> 01:19:14,479
I believe it's a political case.

1076
01:19:14,599 --> 01:19:15,414
Moineau?

1077
01:19:15,810 --> 01:19:17,752
That's all?
What about his car?

1078
01:19:17,872 --> 01:19:19,944
A blue Renault 5
registered in Rome.

1079
01:19:20,064 --> 01:19:22,318
They must have crossed the border
this afternoon.

1080
01:19:22,988 --> 01:19:24,894
Try to determine their route...

1081
01:19:25,014 --> 01:19:27,723
Boulard is already on the case...

1082
01:19:29,748 --> 01:19:30,911
Give me Victor...

1083
01:19:31,174 --> 01:19:32,085
Boulard.

1084
01:19:33,859 --> 01:19:36,305
- I got the gendarmes.
- Let me talk to that fool.

1085
01:19:36,627 --> 01:19:38,245
The incident happened at 2pm.

1086
01:19:38,904 --> 01:19:41,482
It was a blue Renault
and a kid inside?

1087
01:19:42,331 --> 01:19:44,405
You didn't take the car's number
or it's destination?

1088
01:19:45,748 --> 01:19:47,534
But how could I know?

1089
01:19:48,192 --> 01:19:49,631
Do you remember the address?

1090
01:19:49,751 --> 01:19:52,963
On the license it was written
Alesia Street...

1091
01:19:53,957 --> 01:19:56,199
Alesia street.

1092
01:19:56,319 --> 01:19:57,542
House number?

1093
01:19:57,662 --> 01:19:59,676
I can't remember.

1094
01:20:13,532 --> 01:20:15,246
We found Moineau's address.

1095
01:20:15,366 --> 01:20:17,319
We couldn't reach him,
I sent a car.

1096
01:20:17,439 --> 01:20:19,177
What is this crazy story?

1097
01:20:19,297 --> 01:20:20,230
A complete mess...

1098
01:20:31,926 --> 01:20:33,569
You see, it's strange...

1099
01:20:34,094 --> 01:20:36,240
It's not as if I were asking
for the moon...

1100
01:20:37,571 --> 01:20:40,352
I only want to get back
what was taken from me...

1101
01:20:40,676 --> 01:20:41,551
That's all.

1102
01:20:42,206 --> 01:20:44,112
I'd like you to understand that.

1103
01:20:47,780 --> 01:20:49,087
I don't see you...

1104
01:21:12,798 --> 01:21:14,104
Nothing!

1105
01:21:17,413 --> 01:21:19,835
He moved three months ago...

1106
01:21:19,955 --> 01:21:22,291
Looks like he got married...

1107
01:21:23,358 --> 01:21:25,540
To a certain Letessier.

1108
01:21:26,193 --> 01:21:27,390
Nicole Letessier.

1109
01:23:08,095 --> 01:23:09,186
Fabio...

1110
01:23:10,157 --> 01:23:11,727
Don't say anything.

1111
01:23:17,636 --> 01:23:19,063
I am glad to see you.

1112
01:23:20,567 --> 01:23:22,005
Explain how...

1113
01:23:22,868 --> 01:23:25,662
Here I am,
I wanted to see you.

1114
01:23:26,530 --> 01:23:28,814
You drove from Rome
just to...

1115
01:23:28,934 --> 01:23:29,701
Yes!

1116
01:23:31,767 --> 01:23:33,182
What happened to you?

1117
01:23:33,547 --> 01:23:35,117
Oh it's nothing.

1118
01:23:35,237 --> 01:23:36,390
May I come in?

1119
01:23:40,866 --> 01:23:42,473
It's very nice.

1120
01:23:43,432 --> 01:23:44,379
Listen...

1121
01:23:44,499 --> 01:23:45,697
I'd rather you went...

1122
01:23:45,817 --> 01:23:48,830
I had to see you,
so I came!

1123
01:23:49,090 --> 01:23:51,072
Do you have something to eat?

1124
01:23:51,576 --> 01:23:52,310
Eat?

1125
01:23:53,866 --> 01:23:55,304
Yes, I am hungry.

1126
01:24:10,915 --> 01:24:12,101
Just a second!

1127
01:24:16,729 --> 01:24:18,084
Are you well covered?

1128
01:24:18,827 --> 01:24:20,169
Yeah, I am ok.

1129
01:24:44,677 --> 01:24:45,289
So?

1130
01:24:45,409 --> 01:24:46,943
She's in Rome.

1131
01:24:47,063 --> 01:24:48,945
She works for Air France there.

1132
01:24:49,783 --> 01:24:52,624
I don't care how late it is!

1133
01:24:52,744 --> 01:24:55,249
Find a Nicole Letessier,
in Rome,

1134
01:24:55,369 --> 01:24:56,567
She works for Air France.

1135
01:24:56,687 --> 01:24:59,085
And ask her if she's married
to a certain Moineau!

1136
01:25:17,351 --> 01:25:18,549
Would you like to buy it?

1137
01:25:19,100 --> 01:25:19,783
No.

1138
01:25:20,066 --> 01:25:22,272
With what I owe you
you can afford it.

1139
01:25:30,076 --> 01:25:31,947
What about this one?

1140
01:25:32,606 --> 01:25:33,565
Nope.

1141
01:25:42,020 --> 01:25:43,123
Alex, listen...

1142
01:25:45,183 --> 01:25:46,382
What is it, kid?

1143
01:25:47,845 --> 01:25:49,943
If it's going to go like this...

1144
01:25:50,350 --> 01:25:51,657
I won't make it.

1145
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:53,683
You're cold?

1146
01:25:54,973 --> 01:25:56,196
It's not that...

1147
01:25:56,999 --> 01:25:59,073
I am talking about
something else.

1148
01:25:59,738 --> 01:26:00,877
What is it?

1149
01:26:03,181 --> 01:26:04,368
I am scared.

1150
01:26:08,264 --> 01:26:10,122
It's a knot in my stomach.

1151
01:26:12,830 --> 01:26:14,724
If this doesn't stop soon...

1152
01:26:14,844 --> 01:26:17,218
I won't be the same person.

1153
01:26:18,008 --> 01:26:19,159
Listen, kid...

1154
01:26:20,603 --> 01:26:22,497
You don't know
what people can withstand...

1155
01:26:23,634 --> 01:26:26,068
We've done 500 km
and he hasn't shown up.

1156
01:26:27,327 --> 01:26:29,387
There's only 100 km to go...

1157
01:26:30,071 --> 01:26:31,258
You'll make it.

1158
01:26:36,375 --> 01:26:37,910
Are you a fast runner?

1159
01:26:39,724 --> 01:26:40,492
Yeah.

1160
01:26:40,612 --> 01:26:43,045
I bet 1000 francs
that I can beat you over 100m.

1161
01:26:46,078 --> 01:26:47,097
Agreed.

1162
01:26:49,829 --> 01:26:51,627
We'll run to that column there.

1163
01:26:51,747 --> 01:26:55,595
We run around the column
and touch down there!

1164
01:26:56,721 --> 01:26:58,159
Let's start here!

1165
01:26:59,292 --> 01:26:59,940
One...

1166
01:27:01,018 --> 01:27:03,714
First I say: ready...
Go!

1167
01:27:12,151 --> 01:27:12,870
Cheater!

1168
01:27:24,138 --> 01:27:25,601
It does warm you up!

1169
01:27:26,152 --> 01:27:28,718
Not bad for a guy
who doesn't like sports...

1170
01:27:28,838 --> 01:27:29,953
Oh my!

1171
01:27:40,243 --> 01:27:41,430
Feeling better?

1172
01:27:41,910 --> 01:27:44,079
How long since you last ate?

1173
01:27:52,734 --> 01:27:53,705
Listen...

1174
01:27:55,036 --> 01:27:57,002
I know why you're here.

1175
01:28:01,729 --> 01:28:04,966
You called
and I told you I was leaving...

1176
01:28:07,411 --> 01:28:09,845
You wanted things back
as they were.

1177
01:28:11,424 --> 01:28:13,725
You suffered beyond words.

1178
01:28:16,638 --> 01:28:17,957
You still love me.

1179
01:28:18,221 --> 01:28:20,702
I am saying it
so you don't need to humiliate yourself.

1180
01:28:24,218 --> 01:28:26,688
But it's all over, Fabio.
It's over.

1181
01:28:27,719 --> 01:28:29,349
Since a long time.

1182
01:28:31,790 --> 01:28:34,140
I don't feel anything for you,
I'm sorry.

1183
01:28:37,173 --> 01:28:39,583
I'm married to a man I love.

1184
01:28:40,745 --> 01:28:42,016
You must understand.

1185
01:28:43,850 --> 01:28:44,641
No.

1186
01:28:46,319 --> 01:28:47,446
Why no?

1187
01:28:47,722 --> 01:28:49,364
No, I can't understand.

1188
01:28:50,407 --> 01:28:52,050
We were fine together.

1189
01:28:52,563 --> 01:28:55,045
You said everything would be
like before...

1190
01:28:57,430 --> 01:28:59,109
That I could touch you...

1191
01:29:02,993 --> 01:29:04,264
Kiss you...

1192
01:29:05,355 --> 01:29:06,386
I never said that...

1193
01:29:06,506 --> 01:29:07,309
You did!

1194
01:29:07,818 --> 01:29:09,329
In the van, you did!

1195
01:29:09,449 --> 01:29:10,575
What van?

1196
01:29:10,695 --> 01:29:12,222
Driving up here...

1197
01:29:13,505 --> 01:29:16,382
You can't say it's over
when you know it's not!

1198
01:29:20,696 --> 01:29:22,565
You still get those headaches?

1199
01:29:23,164 --> 01:29:25,466
Have you been to a doctor,
like I asked?

1200
01:29:25,586 --> 01:29:26,796
You're my doctor.

1201
01:29:30,558 --> 01:29:31,685
I said no!

1202
01:29:34,982 --> 01:29:36,600
You're even prettier
than before.

1203
01:29:37,847 --> 01:29:39,849
My husband will arrive soon.

1204
01:29:40,687 --> 01:29:41,598
How do you know?

1205
01:29:41,718 --> 01:29:43,048
He did that to me.

1206
01:29:43,816 --> 01:29:45,206
What are you saying?

1207
01:29:45,326 --> 01:29:47,556
Don't worry,
we'll take care of him.

1208
01:29:51,259 --> 01:29:53,117
I don't like it
when you do this!

1209
01:29:58,971 --> 01:30:01,621
Be nice, be nice!

1210
01:30:02,160 --> 01:30:03,551
I left everything...

1211
01:30:04,036 --> 01:30:05,978
I drove like a madman...

1212
01:30:06,098 --> 01:30:08,028
I killed two policemen...

1213
01:30:08,375 --> 01:30:09,945
Now I am here...

1214
01:30:10,065 --> 01:30:12,307
Be nice! Be nice!

1215
01:30:14,369 --> 01:30:15,652
Leave me alone!

1216
01:30:23,475 --> 01:30:24,111
No!

1217
01:30:25,214 --> 01:30:26,520
Calm down...

1218
01:30:27,156 --> 01:30:28,402
It's me...

1219
01:30:28,961 --> 01:30:30,172
Calm down!

1220
01:30:32,030 --> 01:30:33,433
It's me...

1221
01:30:36,914 --> 01:30:37,993
Come here...

1222
01:30:43,965 --> 01:30:44,913
It's ok!

1223
01:30:45,033 --> 01:30:45,836
Calm down...

1224
01:30:47,286 --> 01:30:48,497
It's me...

1225
01:30:50,022 --> 01:30:52,971
How many times
did we make love, Fabio?

1226
01:30:53,714 --> 01:30:55,632
One more time
won't change anything.

1227
01:30:55,752 --> 01:30:56,639
You know my body...

1228
01:30:56,759 --> 01:30:57,634
Quiet!

1229
01:30:58,773 --> 01:31:00,715
I don't love you!

1230
01:31:02,303 --> 01:31:04,773
What have you done to Alex
and my son?

1231
01:31:05,180 --> 01:31:07,410
Nothing happened,
I missed them.

1232
01:31:07,530 --> 01:31:09,387
What do you mean:
missed them?

1233
01:31:15,643 --> 01:31:17,166
Where is my son?

1234
01:31:18,316 --> 01:31:19,959
Don't do that!

1235
01:31:26,489 --> 01:31:30,337
It's not you I love!
Not you!

1236
01:31:30,757 --> 01:31:32,591
I don't love you!

1237
01:32:02,849 --> 01:32:04,252
Tell me we're close...

1238
01:32:04,671 --> 01:32:06,110
Almost there, kid.

1239
01:32:31,808 --> 01:32:33,055
Listen well...

1240
01:32:33,420 --> 01:32:36,357
Don't cry or get nervous,
do as I say...

1241
01:32:37,758 --> 01:32:39,448
I am counting on you.

1242
01:32:47,378 --> 01:32:48,265
Who is it?

1243
01:32:48,385 --> 01:32:49,344
Moineau.

1244
01:32:51,380 --> 01:32:52,604
What is going on?

1245
01:32:52,724 --> 01:32:54,533
Please keep hold of the kid
and call the police.

1246
01:32:54,653 --> 01:32:55,408
Why?

1247
01:32:55,528 --> 01:32:57,889
I can't explain but it's urgent.
Please!

1248
01:32:58,309 --> 01:33:01,556
Listen: stay right here,
do not go anywhere!

1249
01:33:41,087 --> 01:33:42,549
I am warning you...

1250
01:33:53,671 --> 01:33:55,577
Don't say anything
or I'll shoot.

1251
01:34:02,132 --> 01:34:03,175
Here I am.

1252
01:34:04,218 --> 01:34:06,256
Let go of him!

1253
01:34:07,418 --> 01:34:08,425
Watch out, Alex!

1254
01:34:14,739 --> 01:34:16,657
Get out of here!

1255
01:34:18,755 --> 01:34:20,589
Alex, run away,
get out!

1256
01:34:27,031 --> 01:34:28,314
Let me do it, Nicole...

1257
01:35:05,113 --> 01:35:06,792
You know him?

1258
01:35:07,691 --> 01:35:08,386
Yes.

1259
01:35:12,927 --> 01:35:14,078
Where is Marc?

1260
01:36:09,638 --> 01:36:10,849
It's over now.

1261
01:36:21,247 --> 01:36:22,745
It's nothing, kid.

1262
01:36:25,595 --> 01:36:27,345
I didn't want you to die.
