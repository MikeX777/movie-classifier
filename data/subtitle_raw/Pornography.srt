What brings you here,
Frederick?

26
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,756
A cold arctic wind...

27
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,632
or maybe a warm one... I forget.

28
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,677
Is that so?

29
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,598
Earnest as can be,

30
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,599
I've got four hare pelts
and leather soles to sell.

31
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,711
Anyone interested?

32
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,675
Thank you.

33
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,755
Counsellor Lipszyc.

00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,636

Mr. Leleniewski, composer,

Painters,writers
and poets who survived.

37
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,590
The best blue blood in town.
What more can you want?

38
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,633
Just a match, please.

39
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,588
- Where have you been?
- Stop it.

40
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,672
- Where have you been?
- Stop it!

41
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,710
The cloying smells there...

42
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,632
the shamelessly bandied
words,

43
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,719
"God, art, theatre, nation,
proletariat..."

44
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,757
as if the war was of no
concern to us.

45
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,599
We chatted while Europe
was in flames.

46
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,759
Then Frederick arrived,
sat down and said little.

47
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,793
Hardly could I realise that
he'd get me involved

48
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,710
in the strangest story
of my life.

49
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,711
Am I handsome?

50
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,676
You look young.

51
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,711
But am I handsome?

52
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,592
You have a striking face.

53
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,634
But we don't
call it handsome.

54
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,712
You’ve got carried away, huh?

55
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,679
But I like you anyway,
my dear Witold.

56
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,837
I'm not handsome
but you know what?

57
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,596
I'm beautiful.

58
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,595
Let's go.

59
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,757
In the next months.
as we got close...

60
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,835
... he turned out to be
quite refined...

61
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,639
... experienced in theatre,
film, and circus art.

62
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:24,589
One day my old friend
Hippo S. from the Sandomierz region...

63
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,598
... wrote asking me over
with my new friend.

64
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,599
"It's peaceful here but for
some bands of marauders."

65
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,756
"The countryside isn't safe."

66
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,756
"Come, both of you.
The more the merrier."

67
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,669
What's in there?

68
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,749
What's in there?

69
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,755
- Something.
- What?

70
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,596
- Nothing.
- Meaning?

71
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,595
Everything.

72
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,675
Everything?

73
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,593
Will you take the boy
to the manor...

74
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,631
... with a heavy bag of onions?

75
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,789
Sure.

76
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,677
Karol!

77
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,677
There they are.

78
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,756
Thank God, you've arrived.

79
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,791
This must be Mr. Frederick.

80
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,631
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

81
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,797
I know... you wrote...
theatre, wrestling bouts...

82
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,797
... romancing all those
chorus girls, right?

83
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,669
Right.

84
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,633
I won’t ask anything.

85
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,790
- Let me take your case.
- No, thank you...

86
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,599
I’ve grown fat.
Devil only knows why.

87
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,679
Because of everything.
And you're following in my footsteps.

88
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,789
And that's Mary.

89
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,796
My wife... my dear Mary.

90
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:04,633
They burned Sieniechów. In Rudniki.
they broke the overseer's legs.

91
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:15,599
I had refugees
from Poznan.

92
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:23,599
No news from Ostrowiec or
Bodzechów whatsoever.

93
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,750
Everybody's waiting, all ears...

94
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,678
It's peaceful for the time being.

95
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,839
But wait till it bursts
when the front line gets closer.

96
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,757
It'll be a bloodbath...
an explosion, a riot...

97
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,759
Like I say...But the worst thing is
there's nowhere to run.

98
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:25,792
...pray for us now. and
in the hour of our death. Amen.

99
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,599
Hail Mary. full of grace,
The Lord is with thee...

100
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:36,589
... blessed art thou among women
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.

101
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,797
- Hello, Iie-abed!
- What time is it?

102
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,757
- Oh, it's late.
- I promise to improve.

103
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:08,593
And here's Henia.
my beautiful one...

104
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,676
... the most beautiful
in the whole world.

105
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,676
Mum is ready
and the horses are too.

106
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,758
It's Sunday, we’re off to Mass.

107
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,757
You may join us if you like,
but we won't force you.

108
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,669
Truth is the church burned down
and Mass is in the coach house.

109
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,757
You may find it quite interesting,
gentlemen.

110
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:27,792
... Your crown woven of
stars on your head...

111
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,633
I didn't understand
what moved Frederick so much...

112
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,752
Must've been someone
he saw or remembered?

113
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,711
- What's your name?
- Veronika.

114
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,709
Are you sure?

115
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,598
And that's Henia...

116
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,710
My little Henia...

117
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,798
Karol, son of the
overseer of Ikana.

118
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,792
Now. A handyman
in Hippolit's care...

119
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:49,588
A flaxen-haired god,
daring partisan...

120
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,598
and a reckless whipper-snapper.

121
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,837
His appearance tipped
the delicate balance...

122
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,679
... between us and them.
There was too much youth now.

123
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,793
Something pert about Henia
lording it over us. unawares.

124
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,592
Her youth wasn't meant for us...

125
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,713
Karol's youth was for Henia,
and hers was for him...

126
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:52,676
But the whipper-snapper
and the silly goose didn't know it.

127
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,759
Siemian and his men.
Must've shot someone.

128
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,756
Let's go to sleep.

129
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,789
I saw.

130
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,796
A nice couple.

131
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,679
God willing, she'll get
engaged one of these days.

132
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,596
Someone local?

133
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:58,673
Yes. a neighbour,
Vaclav Paszkowski of Ruda...

134
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,598
a very decent man indeed.

135
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,759
His mother runs the estate,
a saintly woman, but... a widow.

136
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:15,673
Henia's young...
No better suitors around, though.

137
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:20,715
Attorney-at-law, responsible,
talented, and very well-read.

138
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,755
I see,

139
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,789
Why so sad?

140
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:30,669
There's something cheeky
about youth, don't you think?

141
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,632
What?

142
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,755
Everything.

143
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,711
I haven't thought about it.

144
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,634
Didn't you see they're
made for each other?

145
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,676
I didn't spy on them.

146
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,678
No mutual attraction at all.

147
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:59,673
What's lacking
is the chemistry of love.

148
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:04,759
- What?
- The chemistry of love!

149
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,598
No power can join them.

150
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:15,675
Rather than power,
it only takes a few tricks...

151
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,592
Like housebreaking a dog.

152
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,632
- Give them a push.
- What?

153
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:28,759
- Give them a push.
- Right away?

154
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,715
Now.

155
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,678
Do you know
what you're abetting?

156
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,633
You really don't.

157
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,715
You want it?

158
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,675
I do.

159
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,678
Want to make a bet?

160
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,796
- What's at stake?
- Exactly...

161
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,678
- What's at stake?
- I don't know.

162
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,678
How. about... everything?

163
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,597
Meaning?

164
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,795
You'll see.

165
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,715
Wait.

166
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:43,759
12 cigarettes...
rolled specially for you.

167
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,790
Brown-nosing, huh?

168
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,755
Are we intruding?

169
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,758
No. I've had it with
these potatoes.

170
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,672
Would Miss...
care for a... stroll?

171
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,596
I sure would.

172
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,672
Closer to the socket.

173
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,595
Karol!

174
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,715
The trouser leg!

175
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,635
Roll it up.

176
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,789
Wait!

177
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,677
Let her do it

178
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,677
Why me?

179
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,716
Do it for him.

180
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,678
So... Let’s go.

181
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,591
The suitcase.

182
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,672
Vaclav...
the captivating lawyer...

183
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:56,759
Henia's fiancé... and yes...
Frederick's future victim.

184
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:01,759
I got it instantly and felt
my sympathy for him grow.

185
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,676
Welcome onboard, friend.

186
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,673
Mr. Frederick, it's terribly sad.

187
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,595
Sad?

188
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,675
Away with it!

189
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,709
Gone!

190
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,796
Play a happy tune, please.

191
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:26,719
Happy?

192
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:36,833
Please.

193
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:51,669
Bravo!

194
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,792
So talented... Is there
anything you can't do?

195
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,677
Many things.

196
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,597
Like what?

197
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:35,679
Well, I can't take you away
from Vaclav. try as I might.

198
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:41,679
No one can do that...
in the whole world.

199
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,795
No thank you.

200
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,710
Hans...

201
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,756
Berta keeps writing me...

202
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,795
Good girl.

203
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,797
... to beware of
those dangerous Poles.

204
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,750
Hans!

205
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,758
But they're such nice folks.

206
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,676
Hans!

207
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:23,752
Eggs! Eggs, for fuck's sake!

208
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,678
Eggs! Capish?

209
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,749
Eggs!

210
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,676
Mr. Myszynski!

211
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:42,599
- Should I give them eggs?
- Yes. And fuck them!

212
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,677
Good morning!

213
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:50,595
Good morning! They don't
understand a fucking word.

214
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,757
Lock the horses in.
With the cows.

215
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,596
- Eggs.
- Yes, eggs.

216
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,755
Wait a minute.

217
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:23,590
Here are your eggs
My pleasure.

218
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:27,674
A gift from
our chickens and cows.

219
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,711
Zoska, the milk!

220
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,751
Here you are.

221
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,591
Here.

222
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,796
- Thank you.
- Good day.

223
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,671
Andres... eggs!

224
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,836
- Here.
- No, thank you.

225
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,632
Good bye.

226
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:13,635
Good fucking riddance!
Don't ever come back again.

227
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,596
I get drunk...

228
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,676
... when I'm afraid.

229
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,791
I stash bottles away everywhere,
in case I get scared.

230
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,598
Do you ever get scared?

231
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,597
Never.

232
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,755
Never?

233
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,595
Sometimes.

234
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,790
- Got scared?
- And how!

235
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,597
So have a drink.

236
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,631
I will.

237
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:12,709
Hello!

238
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,671
Where to?

239
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,790
To the village
to get kerosene.

240
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:21,592
- May I come along?
- Please do.

241
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,679
- And Mr. Frederick?
- No, thank you.

242
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,633
I have to tend the flowerbeds.

243
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,756
The King came and sprinkled...

244
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:20,709
... silver poppy seeds on the eyes
of the mouse and the red pony.

245
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:26,713
The Poppy King's knights
wandered for years.

246
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:32,798
The mouse got very tired.
"Peep. peep. when do we get home?"

247
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:39,758
The King asked,
"Who's been sleeping in my bed?"

248
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,632
"Who's been drinking from my bowl?"

249
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,791
Peep, peep, peep...

250
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:52,629
We're playing.

251
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:54,629
I'm sorry.

252
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,631
That's all right.

253
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,751
What a beautiful dolly!

254
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,711
It's not a dolly.

255
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:09,675
What is it?

256
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:13,593
The Poppy Seed Princess.

257
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:14,755
May I see her?

258
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:22,759
What will I do without her?
I may die...

259
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:33,756
I'll spank you!

260
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,717
Little mermaid...

261
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:56,598
I have a daughter your age.

262
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,597
Delicious...

263
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:07,675
Got any more?

264
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:58,599
- It's paid already.
- For the book.

265
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:04,798
It may be your most expensive one.

266
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,677
What?

267
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:38,632
Having the time of your life, huh?

268
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,597
I'm working hard.

269
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:43,715
I see.

270
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:51,712
What's wrong?
Something happened?

271
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,716
Nothing's happened whatsoever.

272
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:58,677
- Why so nervous then?
- Because I like it.

273
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,796
I can't do without it.

274
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:13,838
Take a sip, come on.
Smell the flowers...

275
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:28,636
See how beautiful it is?

276
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:33,678
The man on high
is watching over us.

277
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:36,638
The children are playing...

278
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:39,632
... and we’re playing with them.
Remember?

279
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:40,709
What's the matter?

280
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,790
- The cork's inside.
- I'll pull it out.

281
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,756
- I'll get another one.
- I'll do it...

282
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:01,675
Leave it!

283
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:04,758
See what you've done?

284
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:06,595
Karol!

285
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:13,712
Why are you shouting
at the woman?

286
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:25,631
Don't be scared. It's dead.

287
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:29,795
Want it?

288
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:42,712
Why worry?
We have enough to eat.

289
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,838
- What're you doing?
- Shining my shoes.

290
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:53,591
Yes? Here!

291
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,711
I'll shine them for you.

292
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:20,750
I'll drive the horses. Dad. OK?

293
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:22,755
Witulin's not far, dear.

294
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:26,598
- Barely 5 km.
- Please, Mum...

295
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:29,598
All right, but with an adult.

296
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:33,712
- Mr. Witold?
- Excellent choice.

297
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:36,593
Witold's a born teamster.

298
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:41,632
Karol! You'll come
with us in a taxi!

299
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:00,672
- You like Karol?
- Of course...

300
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:03,756
- He's a childhood friend.
- I know.

301
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,790
But do you fancy him?

302
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:08,675
- I?
- Yes.

303
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:12,598
- I like him very much.
- Is that all?

304
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:17,599
He's a beautiful boy
and in love with you.

305
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:22,590
Not with me or any other girl.
He just wants to get laid.

306
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,710
He's just a child!
Hurry up!

307
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:34,591
All right. I'll tell you.

308
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:44,678
I'm no shrinking violet.

309
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:50,589
I laid a Home Army man
who stayed with us one night.

310
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:53,676
Do your parents know?

311
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:59,629
They caught us red-handed.
But they didn't catch on.

312
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:05,589
- Why not Karol?
- Because.

313
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:24,677
But you won't tell Vaclav, right?

314
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:28,757
He believes in your
spiritual communion...

315
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,756
He's a true Catholic.

316
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:35,712
Do you think
I have no morality?

317
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:38,593
I'm Catholic too!

318
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:40,791
You believe in God?

319
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:45,831
Would I confess or take
Communion if I didn't?

320
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:49,672
My future man's principles
suit me to a T.

321
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,756
His mother is almost mine.

322
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:55,638
I'm honoured to join
a family like his.

323
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:58,835
Ah, here they are!

324
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:04,678
No more flings
once I marry him.

325
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:36,678
Dear Mrs. Amelia.

326
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:42,598
This is Mr. Frederick, mother.

327
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:49,598
And Mr. Witold, his friend...

328
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:51,756
... a man of letters.

329
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:08,759
With her arrival, a new aura
filled Hippolit's house...

330
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:12,677
... superior, absolute,
dispelling any doubts.

331
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:17,679
Frederick cast away his
two live toys, Henia and Karol.

332
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:23,590
Engrossed in talk with Amelia,
he was dead to the world.

333
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:27,719
They flew over our heads
of ordinary humans...

334
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:31,598
... mostly about God
and the beauty of the world.

335
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,792
Just look how beautiful
it is here.

336
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,676
Absolutely... beautiful.

337
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:45,636
But take a really good look
and admit if it's not.

338
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:49,679
Really very beautiful indeed.

339
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:53,672
Just magnificent!

340
00:56:54,800 --> 00:57:00,636
- You're an atheist, right?
- Right.

341
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:06,598
- Say it, please.
- I am...

342
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:09,631
I'm an atheist.

343
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:13,673
- I knew it.
- Bravo.

344
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:41,797
I'm bored without you,
bored to madness...

345
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:46,599
Along with my dog
and my squirrel...

346
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:50,793
I write, read, and smoke
and my eyes are still blue.

347
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:54,792
But all this is just
the force of habit...

348
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:59,753
The dawn is still grey
and the dusk gold-blue...

349
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:04,793
Day crosses to one.
night to the other side...

350
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:09,632
... and the roses bloom
seemingly unwilling...

351
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:12,598
... as they can't do otherwise.

352
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:16,753
Yet the world has ended.
can you understand?

353
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:21,753
It is no more
and I won't bring it to life.

354
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:27,754
The time is hard and quiet,
but wait a minute... I...

355
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,710
... may be already
on the other side.

356
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:41,673
'Without You' by
Maria Pawlikowska-Jasnorzewska.

357
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:01,672
Are you all right, Mrs. Amelia?

358
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:07,792
- What're you doing. mother?
- Mrs. Amelia!

359
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:14,671
- Oh Jesus!
- Watch out!

360
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:23,671
Water! Mr. Myszynski!

361
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:31,629
Put it out!

362
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:36,796
Shoot at everything.

363
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:42,675
Karol!

364
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,750
She's bleeding copiously.
What do we do?

365
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:47,629
I don't know.

366
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:16,678
Come close to me, please.

367
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:22,835
Closer.

368
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:30,758
Don't leave, please.

369
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:36,833
You'll see.
I want you to see...

370
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:43,717
... everything till the end.

371
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:10,629
Jesus!

372
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:19,838
Sir, we caught the bastard
near Rokiciny...

373
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:21,755
Silence.

374
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:26,676
He had the knife on him.

375
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:49,598
My mother couldn't
have died just like that.

376
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:52,637
No, please!

377
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:54,631
- How then?
- I don't know.

378
01:01:57,640 --> 01:01:58,755
Not that way.

379
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,671
We don't know what happened...

380
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:06,678
... not you, me, or even that boy.

381
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:08,711
Perhaps, as he says...

382
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:14,679
... he took a knife to cut the cake...
- No! No. no.

383
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:26,790
She couldn't have died like that.

384
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:30,756
- It wasn't like that.
- It could’ve been!

385
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:34,678
It could have been.
Imagine it.

386
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:41,595
Even a majestic lady
like your mother...

387
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:45,752
... could have died under
the silliest circumstances...

388
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:48,596
... for a piece of cake.

389
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:50,671
Understand?

390
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:54,592
I don't know.

391
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:58,598
Let's go... please.

392
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:12,599
Thanks to Hippolit's connections,
the death was recorded

393
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:14,790
as 'due to natural causes.'

394
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:21,596
The killer was back on Hippolit's
estate, locked up in the Belfry...

395
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:26,749
... waiting for God knows what
by the decision of no one knew who.

396
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:12,716
Stop! Listen

397
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:22,679
You ride too fast
but sow the grain correctly.

398
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:26,593
- And the raspberry?
- OK.

399
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:29,671
You can get dressed.

400
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:32,792
- The next rehearsal?
- I'll let you know.

401
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:40,754
Well, what do you think,
dear Witold?

402
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:47,759
- Do they act well?
- It's going to be a film.

403
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:51,678
- A film?
- Uh-huh.

404
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:55,712
I have an idea of a screenplay.

405
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:59,753
But some scenes require
experimenting with live actors.

406
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:05,668
Writing a script with no actors
in mind is sheer nonsense, right?

407
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:10,599
First get them to strut their stuff.

408
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:14,679
And the script should
bring out what's in them.

409
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:16,751
You were great.

410
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:21,796
Wait till I tell you.

411
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:23,835
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

412
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:28,598
Aren't you ashamed?

413
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:30,631
Of what?

414
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:35,716
Shame doesn't belong in art.

415
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:49,751
Boor! Murderer!

416
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:52,834
What murderer?

417
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:55,597
It's not true!

418
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:07,676
I won't let you.

419
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:11,712
He's a prisoner
and cannot be beaten.

420
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:26,709
Don't be afraid.

421
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:33,598
It's that death...

422
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:38,792
I can't come to terms with it.

423
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:45,590
Look, your mother always
got down to essentials, right?

424
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:48,675
And you?

425
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:53,709
But I can't.

426
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:02,598
What should I do?

427
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:06,793
Do what you will,
but wear your dignity intact.

428
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:13,631
Tell me what I should do.

429
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:18,673
Live through it till the end!

430
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:24,838
Drink every drop of her death
to the bottom!... Got that?

431
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:32,631
Shitass!

432
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:34,711
I've lost my voice.

433
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:49,675
Come!

434
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:55,709
What's this?

435
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:04,678
I'm writing as I've lost my voice.

436
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:09,630
Judge by this if I've gone crazy,
as I'm not sure myself.

437
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:13,759
When you finish reading this letter.
burn it and pretend...

438
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:16,676
... that nothing happened.

439
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:20,837
Vaclav must see our show.

440
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:24,672
Tell him you’ve found out
about their trysts...

441
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:28,679
... and find it your duty
to let him know.

442
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:32,679
We’ll put the heat on them
till the appearance of betrayal is out.

443
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:35,633
Then we'll see what happens.

444
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:40,759
Don't reply. I'll leave instructions
under the brick by the gate.

445
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:19,676
We're running out of eggs, Andreas.

446
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:23,791
Let's visit the funny Pole.
What's his name?

447
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:30,596
The fatso playing the chicken?
Hippolit or something.

448
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:33,598
Oh, the last eggs.

449
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:04,749
Karol!

450
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:34,790
We've taken the right path.

451
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:38,797
We’ll turn Vaclav into a bed
on which Karol lays Henia.

452
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:42,672
Be gentle and considerate and
Vaclav will believe the hoax.

453
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:45,678
P.S. Did you recognise the man?

454
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:49,634
Colonel Siemian of the
local Home Army unit...

455
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:51,671
... who stopped us on the road.

456
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:12,716
Why did you bring me here?

457
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:16,716
I found it my duty.

458
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:19,676
Thank you very much.

459
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:25,632
I don't think it matters much.

460
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:30,712
Thank you for bringing it
to my attention.

461
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:37,676
They want to liquidate Siemian.

462
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:44,759
Yesterday they came from Warsaw
about a planned action...

463
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:49,633
... but what followed was
a pathetic scene.

464
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:55,673
The colonel said
he was going home...

465
01:12:57,720 --> 01:13:02,589
... that he'd lost his courage
and was full of fear.

466
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:03,789
Really pathetic.

467
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:07,596
Too much tension.

468
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:12,748
It's a... disaster!
You should've seen it.

469
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:17,712
All those secrets he knows.

470
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:21,753
In his present condition,
he's likely to squeal.

471
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:22,799
He will.

472
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:25,669
What now?

473
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:33,675
They'll send some hatchet men
with his death sentence...

474
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:39,669
- What do you think?
- I? It must be done.

475
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:43,751
I see it like a soldier!

476
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:45,675
And we?

477
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:48,675
You what?!.

478
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:54,672
From now on, you too
are soldiers. Wait.

479
01:13:57,640 --> 01:13:59,676
Wait for your orders!

480
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:29,835
Mother!

481
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:53,758
We have a problem with Siemian.
This has messed our plans.

482
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:58,758
Let's wait it out
and see what happens.

483
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:03,678
We'll have to act in sync now.

484
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:08,676
You must burn this letter.

485
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:12,635
Yes?

486
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:18,753
- May I have a word with you?
- Come on in.

487
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:54,633
- Would you rather rest?
- No. no.

488
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:58,678
You know why I'm here?.

489
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:03,599
That show... on the trolley there.

490
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:07,598
I wonder how I could help you?

491
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:10,598
I just want your opinion.

492
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:16,717
Tell me, like man to man.
what you think of it.

493
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:23,795
- I? What's there to think?
- I can't make light of it, see?

494
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:30,598
They're childhood friends.

495
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:34,793
It was just... child's stuff...
a kind of game.

496
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:40,677
Game?

497
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:45,598
- Yes, but...
- What?

498
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:49,637
How should I put it...

499
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:51,751
Rather peculiar...

500
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:57,672
- Odd...
- Calm down!

501
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:03,675
- I shouldn't have taken you there.
- You couldn't have done better.

502
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:15,794
But I have to say one thing...
Loud and clear.

503
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:24,797
I wonder how Henia
can feel anything for me.

504
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:29,752
See the way I am?
I have no illusions.

505
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:32,596
I'm not fond of myself really.

506
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:37,635
I don't understand what
she could see in me.

507
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:46,757
This puts me off. believe me.

508
01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:49,756
What I hold against her...

509
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:52,756
... is the way she welcomes
my advances.

510
01:18:55,720 --> 01:18:57,676
What're going to do?

511
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:03,597
My friends...

512
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:08,598
I'd like to hearten you.

513
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:11,676
I have good news...

514
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:20,796
This war will soon be over.

515
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:27,597
This war...

516
01:20:37,720 --> 01:20:39,597
You look funny.

517
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:43,677
Funny? I?

518
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:48,637
Yes, you.

519
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:52,717
- Me?
- You turned pale... a bit.

520
01:20:56,640 --> 01:20:59,598
But the colours are
coming back now.

521
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:03,634
The saucer got stuck to the cup.
That's all.

522
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:30,677
Good God!
He's a changed man.

523
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,597
All he wants is to run away.

524
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:35,711
I had to lock him up
like a thief.

525
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:40,675
"Just give me the horses and look
the other way"... This is for you.

526
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:45,598
I can't give him the horses.

527
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:05,598
He wants you to be
his accomplice.

528
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:08,598
In getting scared shitless?

529
01:22:11,680 --> 01:22:13,591
If the Germans catch him...

530
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:16,598
- You spoke of hatchet men.
- I did.

531
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:21,593
But they're not here.

532
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:24,757
What if they don't come?

533
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:32,677
What do you think?

534
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:16,595
Excuse me... could you?
Come in.

535
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:30,712
I've got something.

536
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:38,678
I had it stashed away
in the forest.

537
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:04,755
It's strong.

538
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:15,599
You're seeing a man
who badly needs help.

539
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:18,597
How could I help you?

540
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:23,790
I've cracked up, you know.

541
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:26,789
It's this fear.

542
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:29,671
You know what it means...

543
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:32,678
... when a brave man turns chicken?

544
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:37,791
- It's nerves.
- No sir, not nerves.

545
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:41,756
It's a transformation.

546
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:46,599
Daring turns into cowardice.
Understand?

547
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:53,595
Only three weeks ago
I had my goal, task, struggle...

548
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:56,597
Now I have nothing.

549
01:24:56,800 --> 01:25:00,759
Everything's gone, like...
I'm with my pants down.

550
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:05,753
Worse still I'm right!
I'm right at last!

551
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:11,598
Why don't you calm down, Colonel?

552
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:17,678
You want to get rid of me, huh?

553
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:20,671
- Who?
- All of you.

554
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:23,758
You want to do me in, right?
Admit it.

555
01:25:24,640 --> 01:25:27,632
- I?
- I'm no fool.

556
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:29,751
As long as I feared nothing.
they feared me.

557
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:32,790
Now I'm scared, so I'm dangerous.

558
01:25:33,680 --> 01:25:34,715
What can I do?

559
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:38,668
Just tell them to let me go.

560
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:42,597
Or help me escape.

561
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:45,633
Give me a hand.

562
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:49,633
Colonel, there's a war on,
the country's occupied.

563
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:53,678
- To desert now....
- Uh-huh...

564
01:25:56,640 --> 01:25:59,791
Ever been scared shitless?
I am now.

565
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:05,595
- I've lost it. Got that?
- Listen to me, Colonel.

566
01:26:07,720 --> 01:26:11,759
First, calm down. Tell them it's
a passing nervous breakdown.

567
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:21,632
And I'll talk with Hippolit.

568
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:25,758
Maybe I'll be able
to arrange your leave.

569
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:33,679
No way out. We must cooperate
in this underground action.

570
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:38,639
And not a peep about ours.
Act as if you were...

571
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:42,753
... with the Home Army struggle,
the Poland versus Germany dilemma...

572
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:45,756
... not Henia and Karol's coupling.

573
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:49,758
We must see our plan through.

574
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:15,751
They’ve sent an order.

575
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:19,591
They're not coming.

576
01:27:19,720 --> 01:27:23,679
- So they leave it to us?
- Your voice is back?

577
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:27,594
- By ourselves?
- Yes, fuck it!

578
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:33,752
- Who then?
- What?

579
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:35,675
Who'll do it?

580
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:39,752
First we must decide how...

581
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:43,675
So. how?

582
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:49,634
Quietly.
No pistol... a knife.

583
01:27:54,720 --> 01:27:58,679
We could enter
through the wardrobe.

584
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:02,672
That's no good,
the man hardly sleeps.

585
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:06,791
Get him to open the door himself.

586
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:08,749
You're right.

587
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:16,596
Now the hardest part.

588
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:18,751
To kill him?

589
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:24,637
I couldn't.

590
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:28,676
Neither could you.

591
01:28:29,640 --> 01:28:31,790
- Why not?
- Can you?

592
01:28:40,640 --> 01:28:41,595
And you?

593
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:44,675
No.

594
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:47,633
Enough! I'll do it
without your help.

595
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:48,670
- You?
- I?

596
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:53,593
Out of the question!

597
01:28:56,720 --> 01:29:00,793
It's an order!
We've received an order!

598
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:06,676
I can't be a swine.

599
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:10,835
Some sense of duty at least.

600
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:14,638
I know... duty, responsibility...

601
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:20,675
- But you can't slaughter him!
- Bugger! How then?

602
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:27,595
How?

603
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:39,678
- Have Karol do it.
- Karol?

604
01:29:41,720 --> 01:29:42,675
Who else?

605
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:50,793
Karol... Could be...
the simplest way indeed.

606
01:29:59,720 --> 01:30:02,598
- Hello!
- Hello. hello.

607
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:23,679
Siemian's turned traitor.
We have proof.

608
01:30:26,680 --> 01:30:28,671
You'll slit his throat tonight.

609
01:30:29,720 --> 01:30:30,596
I?

610
01:30:32,640 --> 01:30:33,629
Scared?

611
01:30:34,840 --> 01:30:36,671
With what?

612
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:39,597
A knife.

613
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:43,678
What if he doesn't open the door?

614
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:46,752
We’ll find a way
to make him open it.

615
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:06,678
- Little sparrow...
- What're you up to?

616
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:10,674
Smoking a cigarette...
one of the twelve.

617
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:15,715
- Let's say... Saint Peter...
- I mean about Karol.

618
01:31:16,640 --> 01:31:20,599
As far as I know...
he doesn't smoke.

619
01:31:24,840 --> 01:31:27,638
I shouldn't have brought you here.

620
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:31,712
It was me who brought you.

621
01:31:34,760 --> 01:31:36,671
I almost forgot.

622
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:40,759
I was looking for you.
No one's minding the store.

623
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:46,758
The caretaker... is asleep.

624
01:32:22,640 --> 01:32:23,675
Come in please.

625
01:32:37,680 --> 01:32:39,750
What do I do with this?

626
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:48,591
Who's been drinking from my cup?
Who's been eating from my bowl?

627
01:33:05,720 --> 01:33:07,597
What's this tune?

628
01:33:10,680 --> 01:33:11,829
Just a tune.

629
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:17,791
Strange... both happy and sad.

630
01:33:20,760 --> 01:33:22,671
Hela did say the same.

631
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:24,677
- Who?
- Hela...

632
01:33:26,640 --> 01:33:28,676
... my friend's daughter.

633
01:33:29,720 --> 01:33:31,711
What's this story?

634
01:33:33,800 --> 01:33:35,597
A sad one.

635
01:33:37,640 --> 01:33:39,790
I admire sad stories.

636
01:33:41,680 --> 01:33:45,593
- You won’t like this one.
- How do you know?

637
01:33:51,640 --> 01:33:52,755
I had a friend...

638
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:58,678
... a Pole married to a Jew.

639
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:04,633
She was lucky to have died
before all this.

640
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:14,676
We'd tell that bon vivant.
"No booze or women."

641
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:17,712
"Your daughter's Jewish."
He wouldn't listen.

642
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:22,675
He'd hide her in the closet
and come back at dawn.

643
01:34:24,640 --> 01:34:27,677
She'd say,
"Don't leave me. dad."

644
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:31,679
To make up,
he'd whistle this tune.

645
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:39,678
"Don't be angry", he'd say.

646
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:42,790
"I'll dance with you.
Like with a real lady."

647
01:34:43,680 --> 01:34:47,593
In his arms, her legs dangling
over the floor... they'd dance.

648
01:34:48,840 --> 01:34:51,718
It was her favourite pastime.

649
01:34:55,640 --> 01:34:56,834
What was next?

650
01:34:58,680 --> 01:35:01,672
One night he was too late.

651
01:35:02,760 --> 01:35:07,629
She couldn't wait so she went
out onto the stairs... the street.

652
01:35:11,680 --> 01:35:17,596
- With her black eyes and hair...
- Don't finish.

653
01:35:18,720 --> 01:35:21,678
- I know what comes next.
- You don't...

654
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:25,598
You can't even guess.

655
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:31,712
He bribed everyone,
Poles, Jews, Germans...

656
01:35:31,880 --> 01:35:36,590
... and went off on
the same transport with her.

657
01:35:37,640 --> 01:35:41,633
When she saw him.
at the entrance to the camp,

658
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:45,752
she stretched out her hands,
"Tateleh! Tateleh!"

659
01:35:47,680 --> 01:35:51,639
You know what happened?
He hid.

660
01:35:55,800 --> 01:35:58,678
He hid from her... his own child.

661
01:36:04,640 --> 01:36:08,599
A couple of days in a cattle car
amidst corpses and shit...

662
01:36:08,720 --> 01:36:10,790
... turned him into an animal.

663
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:19,669
And then... they gave him
a pretty serial number.

664
01:36:20,760 --> 01:36:25,595
You know what? 123000.

665
01:36:29,800 --> 01:36:32,678
And a triangle with the letter P.

666
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:40,711
I'm sorry, madam.

667
01:36:49,720 --> 01:36:51,676
You know why I’ve come.

668
01:36:55,720 --> 01:36:57,676
No idea.

669
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:05,757
Karol can't kill.
He's still a child.

670
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:12,711
This is war.

671
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:46,672
Vaclav, talk to me.

672
01:39:53,880 --> 01:39:56,599
Say something. please.

673
01:40:36,680 --> 01:40:39,831
- Karol told you about Siemian?
- A little.

674
01:40:41,720 --> 01:40:45,633
You'll go with him, you hear?

675
01:40:47,800 --> 01:40:51,588
You'll knock. He'll open for you.

676
01:40:53,720 --> 01:40:56,598
He won't suspect anything.

677
01:40:57,800 --> 01:41:00,712
- Will you?
- I will.

678
01:41:00,840 --> 01:41:03,673
He's a traitor. He must die.

679
01:41:22,720 --> 01:41:24,597
What're you doing here?

680
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:27,671
I'm wondering...

681
01:41:31,640 --> 01:41:32,709
At what?

682
01:41:36,720 --> 01:41:39,598
The chemistry of love.

683
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:44,638
Knife and blood...

684
01:41:46,720 --> 01:41:48,631
... will unite them all.

685
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:56,595
As the youngster kills
an adult up there...

686
01:41:56,720 --> 01:42:00,599
... here another adult will sacrifice
the youngster. Full circle.

687
01:42:03,800 --> 01:42:06,598
A bloody communion.

688
01:42:07,720 --> 01:42:09,711
- What?
- Nothing.

689
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:16,595
I'm checking if you think
I still have all my marbles.

690
01:44:22,640 --> 01:44:26,599
I’ve more important things
than your boozing, you hear?

691
01:44:35,720 --> 01:44:38,757
Colonel, it's me, Henia.

692
01:44:39,720 --> 01:44:41,790
I have important news for you.

693
01:44:43,680 --> 01:44:44,669
Colonel?

694
01:45:14,680 --> 01:45:16,671
Jesus Mary, have you seen this?

695
01:45:21,800 --> 01:45:24,712
- Vaclav.
- Let me alone!

696
01:46:07,720 --> 01:46:08,709
See?

697
01:46:13,720 --> 01:46:14,840
I told you so.

698
01:46:14,840 --> 01:46:15,590
I told you so.

699
01:46:44,760 --> 01:46:47,638
I'll leave it for you on the road.

700
01:47:03,880 --> 01:47:06,599
Don't spy on me.

701
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:13,635
My mother would slap me
on the wrist for being indiscreet.

702
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:48,673
And that's all.

703
01:48:52,720 --> 01:48:54,756
CAST OF CHARACTERS
