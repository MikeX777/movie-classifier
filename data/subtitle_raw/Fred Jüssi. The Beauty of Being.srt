FRED JÜSSI
THE BEAUTY OF BEING

2
00:04:00,311 --> 00:04:06,071
A FILM BY JAAN TOOTSEN

3
00:04:58,015 --> 00:05:04,135
I'm no researcher or a scientist.
Rather, I'm an observer.

4
00:05:06,045 --> 00:05:12,285
And I've focused on relationships,
as constituents of a whole.

5
00:05:12,295 --> 00:05:15,775
This beauty
has captivated me.

6
00:05:18,545 --> 00:05:24,545
And sharing this beauty,
or experiences of it, with others

7
00:05:25,295 --> 00:05:27,775
suits me best.

8
00:05:37,525 --> 00:05:43,765
I sought a more intimate contact
with this world through education,

9
00:05:43,775 --> 00:05:47,015
so I studied biology.

10
00:05:47,525 --> 00:05:55,025
Recording the sounds of nature
as well as nature photography

11
00:05:55,025 --> 00:06:01,785
have been a means of perception.
And they've been very enriching.

12
00:06:10,023 --> 00:06:15,071
It broadens your world.
I discovered a whole new world

13
00:06:15,071 --> 00:06:19,551
once I started living
via my ears. It's surprising!

14
00:06:25,121 --> 00:06:31,361
I can't tell how much photography
has enriched my perception of

15
00:06:31,371 --> 00:06:37,131
colour and form. And light!
My comprehension of light.

16
00:06:43,121 --> 00:06:47,961
What is this light we live in?
Such a mundane thing.

17
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,600
But as you delve into it and as it
gains importance in your work,

18
00:06:54,621 --> 00:06:58,861
new layers begin
to reveal themselves.

19
00:09:47,661 --> 00:09:50,901
Awareness is important.

20
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:57,711
All we need is all around us.
And some things are just given.

21
00:09:58,342 --> 00:10:03,062
For example, we're all given
a course to follow.

22
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,800
This course is yours alone.

23
00:10:13,814 --> 00:10:16,294
The course is important.

24
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:26,815
As for the destination...
It might sound odd,

25
00:10:28,055 --> 00:10:34,055
but I'm one of those people
who doesn't have goals in life.

26
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:38,542
Nor principles.

27
00:10:42,983 --> 00:10:47,223
Not that I'm depraved
or wholly unambitious,

28
00:10:48,201 --> 00:10:50,721
but I trust my course.

29
00:10:50,731 --> 00:10:57,451
And if you trust it,
if you hold true to your course

30
00:10:57,489 --> 00:11:04,969
and follow the chime of this inner
sound that you're compelled to hear,

31
00:11:04,984 --> 00:11:08,504
you'll surely reach
your destination.

32
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:15,484
And I've experienced that as that
unseen or unknown destination nears,

33
00:11:15,484 --> 00:11:18,484
the clearer
it shows itself.

34
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:24,520
And when you're finally there,
you'll exclaim with surprise,

35
00:11:24,545 --> 00:11:30,585
'Ah, so that's where I was headed!
I've reached my goal.'

36
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:14,221
When I speak of silence
as the shaper of a person,

37
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:20,240
I'm thinking of the profound effect
silence has had on my relations with

38
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,000
nature,

39
00:14:22,023 --> 00:14:23,423
people,

40
00:14:23,441 --> 00:14:24,801
music,

41
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,960
visual arts,

42
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:28,641
poetry...

43
00:14:29,441 --> 00:14:36,201
Because silence is inherent
in all these realms, and many others.

44
00:14:38,191 --> 00:14:42,431
Either directly
or indirectly.

45
00:14:43,191 --> 00:14:48,191
Thus, I think of silence
as a natural resource.

46
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:39,311
Being your own companion,
accepting yourself,

47
00:15:39,335 --> 00:15:43,295
learning to live with yourself
is no easy feat.

48
00:15:43,319 --> 00:15:48,399
That's why, I've noticed,
people are afraid of silence.

49
00:15:57,871 --> 00:16:00,871
Silence has
its own measure.

50
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:06,720
Make no mistake, I'm not saying
silence is some ultimate bliss.

51
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,220
That all is fine
so long as it's silent.

52
00:16:10,244 --> 00:16:15,884
No, silence has its measure.
And it's different for all people.

53
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:20,628
One has to bear it,
while another needs it...

54
00:16:20,652 --> 00:16:24,732
It depends on
one's nature, I guess.

55
00:16:50,741 --> 00:16:53,801
You might see
a glade of cowslips.

56
00:16:53,801 --> 00:17:00,081
Or marsh-marigolds growing
on a riverbank, in springtime.

57
00:17:00,511 --> 00:17:03,751
Or an underbrush
covered with liverleafs

58
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:07,320
and later aglow
with thimbleweeds.

59
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:16,160
But finding what's truly yours
in all that glory takes time.

60
00:17:20,751 --> 00:17:23,751
That's how
a relationship grows.

61
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:29,672
These bonds are the main asset
when you're your own company.

62
00:17:33,811 --> 00:17:38,131
Some might say they're
alone when they're out.

63
00:17:39,811 --> 00:17:44,571
In a forest or at a seaside,
in a meadow or a marsh...

64
00:17:44,595 --> 00:17:47,315
But really,
I'm not alone.

65
00:19:10,301 --> 00:19:15,061
There's so much talk of
hard work and success...

66
00:19:15,085 --> 00:19:18,805
'Grow your business!
Grow yourself!'

67
00:19:20,051 --> 00:19:25,291
So that you end up
with no time for yourself.

68
00:19:26,801 --> 00:19:30,281
You have to have
time for yourself.

69
00:19:48,451 --> 00:19:55,091
You can't let others organise your
weekends and evenings and mornings,

70
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,320
and whatever else...

71
00:19:57,344 --> 00:20:00,304
You need time
for idling!

72
00:20:23,284 --> 00:20:27,044
We've been taught
to work hard.

73
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:31,520
Now we ought to be taught
to slack off.

74
00:20:31,534 --> 00:20:34,534
That is, to rest.

75
00:20:35,954 --> 00:20:41,954
Sometimes you have to be
sinfully slothful and by yourself.

76
00:21:24,611 --> 00:21:29,851
In April 1983
I recorded a nocturnal bird.

77
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:37,720
I recorded its songs and the silence
dwelling in the pauses between them.

78
00:21:40,111 --> 00:21:46,871
It sounds as if I did so in a church
because it sang its nightly song

79
00:21:47,611 --> 00:21:54,091
in a forest of tall pine trees.
Like pillars supporting arches.

80
00:21:54,611 --> 00:21:59,331
That is, treetops
merging overhead.

81
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:09,111
I managed to send a copy of that
recording from the USSR to England,

82
00:22:10,792 --> 00:22:17,872
since I had some great contacts
at the BBC Natural History Unit.

83
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:24,625
Surprisingly, I received a letter
of gratitude urging me to send them

84
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:28,385
silence from
a coniferous forest.

85
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:38,600
That was my first encounter
with silence as a commodity.

86
00:23:17,241 --> 00:23:20,481
I like listening to water.

87
00:23:23,241 --> 00:23:26,721
It's a peculiar pleasure.

88
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:33,971
I even have my own
spots for doing it.

89
00:23:34,741 --> 00:23:41,501
You sit down by a river and start
catching different tones in its flow.

90
00:23:45,741 --> 00:23:50,981
It runs fast in some places,
over rocks. Lazily in others.

91
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,480
Over a fallen tree, say.
There are higher and lower sounds.

92
00:23:59,161 --> 00:24:01,921
It's fascinating
to listen to!

93
00:24:47,011 --> 00:24:50,491
The cosmos
that surrounds us,

94
00:24:52,261 --> 00:24:56,781
that is so awe-inspiring
and so admired by us,

95
00:24:56,805 --> 00:25:02,245
so secret and mystical...
It's actually a continuum!

96
00:25:02,269 --> 00:25:07,389
It continues... All it has,
I have – within myself.

97
00:25:07,901 --> 00:25:12,381
Like a droplet of water
from snowmelt or rain...

98
00:25:12,405 --> 00:25:18,165
It's hanging on a branch
and when you take a closer look,

99
00:25:18,189 --> 00:25:24,389
you see the whole landscape in it:
the upturned forest, flower fields...

100
00:25:26,151 --> 00:25:30,151
Whatever it may show you,
tiny though it is.

101
00:25:30,175 --> 00:25:34,895
Everything's in it.
And I, too, am such a droplet!

102
00:27:22,481 --> 00:27:26,961
I'm no churchgoer.
Though I like visiting them,

103
00:27:26,981 --> 00:27:29,981
whether home or abroad,

104
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,400
to sit awhile and
listen and look, and take it all in.

105
00:27:36,281 --> 00:27:39,281
But my church
is the forest.

106
00:27:39,305 --> 00:27:45,265
And as for my religiosity,
if I can even call it that,

107
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:50,529
it has everything to do
with the forest, the trees...

108
00:27:52,781 --> 00:27:59,261
I find it unfathomable
that people don't appreciate

109
00:27:59,285 --> 00:28:01,765
or love living trees...

110
00:28:01,789 --> 00:28:05,029
I've never understood it.

111
00:33:08,501 --> 00:33:14,701
Come summer, I like to go out
and gaze at clouds passing by...

112
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:23,701
For us northerners, summer is
a time to recharge, rest and settle.

113
00:33:24,161 --> 00:33:29,481
Cicadas and grasshoppers chirping
adds a lot to the experience.

114
00:33:29,485 --> 00:33:33,205
A blowfly or a bumblebee
might pass through.

115
00:33:33,206 --> 00:33:36,366
And there you are,
gazing at clouds.

116
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:40,360
Fully immersed
in doing nothing!

117
00:33:40,851 --> 00:33:44,091
Just idling,
quite literally.

118
00:33:45,851 --> 00:33:49,091
But it's like
a purification.

119
00:34:20,101 --> 00:34:24,851
Looking at the clouds,
at the sky,

120
00:34:25,351 --> 00:34:30,111
I enter a realm
of no notions.

121
00:34:30,391 --> 00:34:35,151
In it, there's no good or bad,
no big or small.

122
00:34:35,171 --> 00:34:37,921
No thoughts even...

123
00:34:37,945 --> 00:34:43,665
I've noticed, on these occasions
I'm not thinking at all.

124
00:34:43,689 --> 00:34:49,929
It's a 'state of mind', yet it's also
a realm without such concepts.

125
00:35:27,301 --> 00:35:33,781
Gandhi has said that the world
has enough for everyone's need,

126
00:35:34,301 --> 00:35:38,141
but not enough
for everyone's greed.

127
00:35:40,881 --> 00:35:43,681
That, it cannot sustain.

128
00:35:59,211 --> 00:36:02,131
My time here
is almost up.

129
00:36:02,131 --> 00:36:07,251
And I've often thought
I'm glad, in a way,

130
00:36:07,259 --> 00:36:13,899
that I don't have to witness
how our GDP is further 'raised'.

131
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:27,811
Traversing boglands
is not easy.

132
00:38:29,051 --> 00:38:34,531
Viktor Masing has said that
the fact one can't hurry in a bog

133
00:38:34,555 --> 00:38:37,315
is reason enough
to visit one.

134
00:38:37,801 --> 00:38:42,961
This is something
our oldest landscape can teach us.

135
00:40:40,551 --> 00:40:44,271
It was a very quiet,
moonlit night.

136
00:40:46,271 --> 00:40:49,271
A lone dog
was barking far off.

137
00:40:53,021 --> 00:40:57,501
You can reach
a very peculiar

138
00:40:57,771 --> 00:41:02,251
state of mind
in complete silence.

139
00:41:04,271 --> 00:41:07,271
Away from the
clamour of the world

140
00:41:07,295 --> 00:41:10,295
and wandering
around in a forest...

141
00:41:15,521 --> 00:41:21,001
That moonlight contains all the
moonlit nights of my conscious life.

142
00:41:21,025 --> 00:41:25,025
Suddenly, they all
spring to life.

143
00:41:35,771 --> 00:41:39,531
And so you
stand there, and look...

144
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:50,000
Not at the moon so much,
but at what it does to the landscape.

145
00:41:50,271 --> 00:41:55,511
How it changes a forest,
or a river valley...

146
00:41:55,535 --> 00:42:01,815
Or the grass, fence pickets,
a chimney on a roof, its shingles.

147
00:42:24,911 --> 00:42:30,391
I remember, in early childhood
I was often terribly ill.

148
00:42:32,421 --> 00:42:37,181
And a few times,
I had a vision.

149
00:42:37,681 --> 00:42:45,361
It was only many years later
that I met a very wise old woman.

150
00:42:47,931 --> 00:42:51,931
And we had many talks
on different topics

151
00:42:51,931 --> 00:42:56,211
I've not discussed
with anyone else.

152
00:42:56,211 --> 00:43:02,931
I described my vision to her.
Though it's hard to convey visually.

153
00:43:02,939 --> 00:43:09,179
She looked at me and I asked her
if she knew what I had experienced.

154
00:43:09,203 --> 00:43:13,403
'I do,' she said.
'That was death.'

155
00:43:13,891 --> 00:43:17,131
'It neared.
But didn't take you.'

156
00:43:17,155 --> 00:43:23,155
Though I recall feeling dread
before that vision, as a child,

157
00:43:23,179 --> 00:43:29,379
I didn't know it had anything to do
with the fear of death.

158
00:43:30,581 --> 00:43:36,821
And I haven't given much heed
to grand ideas about the afterlife

159
00:43:36,845 --> 00:43:39,325
and all that.

160
00:43:39,349 --> 00:43:44,829
I know nothing of my birth,
or what this world was like

161
00:43:44,831 --> 00:43:46,831
before I came about.

162
00:43:46,845 --> 00:43:51,611
Similarly, I know nothing
of leaving this world.

163
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:55,090
I've no point
of reference even!

164
00:43:55,541 --> 00:44:01,901
So I haven't bothered to think
where I go and what comes next.

165
00:45:53,261 --> 00:45:57,741
Juhan Liiv has said that
poetry is like wind,

166
00:45:58,261 --> 00:46:02,301
but without wind,
the earth would stink.

167
00:46:04,951 --> 00:46:09,871
At times I spend hours
listening to the wind.

168
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:14,560
Especially in a pine forest.
When the flaking bark

169
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:16,963
vibrates in the wind.

170
00:46:16,985 --> 00:46:23,465
It makes this music.
You can hear a whole symphony in it.

171
00:46:28,841 --> 00:46:35,961
Wind makes no sound by itself.
But you can hear it as it enters

172
00:46:35,961 --> 00:46:42,281
an old windmill or a chimney flue
and rattles the stove door

173
00:46:42,291 --> 00:46:44,931
as you're making a fire.

174
00:46:45,571 --> 00:46:51,851
And what the wind does to the sea
is familiar to every Estonian.

175
00:47:01,321 --> 00:47:07,561
Wind... can be a sign of danger
but also a great companion.

176
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:12,320
A very calming companion.
Like sounds of the sea,

177
00:47:12,321 --> 00:47:16,575
wind sounds can be
very calming.

178
00:48:07,811 --> 00:48:12,571
There was a time when
I went out to hear birdsong.

179
00:48:14,561 --> 00:48:19,801
And finally I reached
an age and a period in my life

180
00:48:19,815 --> 00:48:24,295
where I go out
to hear living silence.

181
00:48:26,311 --> 00:48:29,071
It's a great pleasure.

182
00:54:37,141 --> 00:54:43,181
A lot can be said about the level
of culture of a land or a people

183
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:49,360
by how highly it regards and
cares for its natural resources.

184
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:55,605
How well-studied and known they are,
'resources' in the broadest sense,

185
00:54:55,605 --> 00:55:01,925
how well-preserved they are...
It's purely a matter of culture.

186
00:57:53,651 --> 00:57:57,411
I spent last Christmas
in the forest.

187
00:57:58,151 --> 00:58:01,401
I've been alone
since my wife died.

188
00:58:01,401 --> 00:58:06,881
And I had little desire to go
visit someone as usual.

189
00:58:06,905 --> 00:58:12,385
To be someone's guest,
sit at a table and...

190
00:58:13,152 --> 00:58:14,632
well...

191
00:58:15,131 --> 00:58:20,401
play at celebrating Christmas,
as insolent as it may sound.

192
00:58:20,401 --> 00:58:24,121
But I felt things might
turn out that way,

193
00:58:24,129 --> 00:58:30,089
if I couldn't spend Christmas
by myself – and by my campfire.

194
00:58:32,062 --> 00:58:35,582
By the smell of its smoke.
I need it!

195
00:58:35,617 --> 00:58:41,097
Just as some need oxygen to live,
I need my fire and its smell.

196
00:58:41,121 --> 00:58:44,201
It's one of my
favourite aromas.

197
00:58:49,711 --> 00:58:55,071
It's some innate need
that stems from one's nature.

198
00:58:55,091 --> 00:59:01,211
And if you're at all able to follow
your nature, then please do.

199
00:59:03,211 --> 00:59:08,971
Though a person who does
doesn't have it easy

200
00:59:08,995 --> 00:59:12,475
once they've
recognised their nature.

201
00:59:12,499 --> 00:59:18,699
It means you have to remain
true to yourself in all situations.

202
00:59:18,711 --> 00:59:21,471
Which isn't
always possible.

203
00:59:23,231 --> 00:59:28,471
But whenever possible,
try and follow your nature.
