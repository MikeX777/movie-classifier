1
00:01:33,733 --> 00:01:34,870
The throat, Señora.

2
00:01:35,603 --> 00:01:38,021
Oh, your voice.
It's like a bell tonight.

3
00:01:38,276 --> 00:01:40,408
Thank you, Dottore.
Then don't wash it all away.

4
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,206
The wig. Quick. Yes, hurry.

5
00:01:43,501 --> 00:01:44,541
Have you fixed it?

6
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,938
In the first act it looked
like a bird's nest.

7
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,922
Excuse me Madame Della Robbia.

8
00:01:49,557 --> 00:01:50,884
Good evening, good evening.

9
00:01:50,984 --> 00:01:52,150
Good evening, Farnham.

10
00:01:52,554 --> 00:01:54,385
What a house we got out there tonight.

11
00:01:55,047 --> 00:01:56,784
They come see my Tosca.

12
00:01:57,028 --> 00:01:59,301
The most beautiful Tosca in the world.

13
00:01:59,798 --> 00:02:02,465
Hey, that good-looking American
is out front again tonight.

14
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,118
Who is that?

15
00:02:04,356 --> 00:02:07,830
You know. The fellow that sits in the
right-hand box every time you sing.

16
00:02:08,582 --> 00:02:10,368
Don't tell me you hadn't noticed him.

17
00:02:12,321 --> 00:02:13,876
Goodnight, Madame Della Robbia.

18
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,072
I do not care about some
silly stage-door Jackie.

19
00:02:20,016 --> 00:02:20,786
Johnny.

20
00:02:21,603 --> 00:02:23,865
Whatever you want to call
him. I'm not interested.

21
00:02:27,311 --> 00:02:28,355
Is he good-looking?

22
00:02:42,521 --> 00:02:44,446
Fond of opera, aren't you?
- Huh?

23
00:02:45,554 --> 00:02:47,276
Especially if Miss
Della Robbia sings it.

24
00:02:48,205 --> 00:02:49,271
What do you mean?

25
00:02:49,595 --> 00:02:52,406
You come to hear her often, don't you?
- Every time she sings.

26
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:54,555
Why you silly boy.

27
00:02:56,377 --> 00:02:57,425
Don't you like her?

28
00:02:57,666 --> 00:03:00,682
Oh, of course she's handsome.
But I've certainly heard better voices.

29
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:03,093
I haven't.

30
00:03:04,154 --> 00:03:06,714
Gerald, don't do that.
You look so conspicuous.

31
00:03:07,371 --> 00:03:08,678
Shut up, Flora.
- What?

32
00:03:09,325 --> 00:03:11,181
Shut up Flora. This is her big scene.

33
00:03:12,903 --> 00:03:14,168
What's it about?

34
00:03:16,114 --> 00:03:16,788
Look.

35
00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:20,271
This man, has tortured Tosca's
lover and put him in prison.

36
00:03:20,985 --> 00:03:24,612
Now, he's agreed to let him
go if she'll yield to his ..

37
00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:26,292
Unholy demands.

38
00:03:27,983 --> 00:03:28,687
Oh.

39
00:07:26,287 --> 00:07:27,100
Madame.

40
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:30,236
Madame.

41
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:49,084
Help him someone. Dottore!

42
00:07:50,191 --> 00:07:51,581
Get my Doctor.
- Dottore!

43
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,002
Open the mouth.

44
00:07:56,425 --> 00:07:57,280
No, no, no.

45
00:07:57,543 --> 00:07:58,903
Bring the stretcher.

46
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,805
Uno momenta Señora, uno momenta.

47
00:08:02,074 --> 00:08:04,584
Dottore, you take him.
- Uno momento Señora, uno momento.

48
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,663
Will nobody get me a stretcher?

49
00:08:12,505 --> 00:08:15,030
I've come for the gentleman who's
hurt, Mr Fitzgerald. You know ..

50
00:08:17,735 --> 00:08:18,629
Gerald.

51
00:08:19,162 --> 00:08:22,121
Would the hospital be better perhaps?
- No, no. The villa.

52
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,446
We must nurse him with our own hands.

53
00:08:25,932 --> 00:08:28,573
Gerald .. speak to me.
- He is unconscious.

54
00:08:28,936 --> 00:08:31,085
We must get him to the hotel.
- But you are his wife?

55
00:08:31,185 --> 00:08:31,814
No.

56
00:08:31,998 --> 00:08:33,382
He's a friend, then?
- Yes.

57
00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:36,242
No .. not what you mean. Not at all.

58
00:08:36,476 --> 00:08:37,202
Good.

59
00:08:37,528 --> 00:08:38,902
I will take him to my villa.

60
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,806
You will do nothing of the kind.

61
00:08:41,024 --> 00:08:43,541
Madame, why do you keep interfering?
What exactly is it with you?

62
00:08:43,832 --> 00:08:46,297
He's an old friend of my husband.
- Where then is your husband?

63
00:08:46,503 --> 00:08:48,763
My husband is dead but
I've known him all my life.

64
00:08:49,026 --> 00:08:51,026
Madame, you do not make
sense. Please go away.

65
00:08:51,232 --> 00:08:52,672
Please Madame, you must go away.

66
00:08:55,177 --> 00:08:57,018
You leave me alone.
- You take care of her.

67
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:04,314
Uno momento. He's coming round.

68
00:09:06,086 --> 00:09:07,748
My wonderful rescuer.

69
00:09:09,644 --> 00:09:11,254
Are you alright?

70
00:09:11,939 --> 00:09:14,315
I am yes .. but you .. are you alright?

71
00:09:14,606 --> 00:09:15,611
Yes. Sure .. I ..

72
00:09:16,371 --> 00:09:18,634
Oh, my head.
- Your poor head.

73
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:21,220
Gently .. gently.

74
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:08,055
I know Madame Della Robbia
is here. But who is with her?

75
00:10:08,344 --> 00:10:12,332
We are not permitted to give out any
such information about our guests.

76
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:14,595
Look here.

77
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,562
I'm her brother.
- Indeed?

78
00:10:17,852 --> 00:10:18,961
You don't believe me?

79
00:10:19,061 --> 00:10:21,177
The family resemblance is not marked.

80
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:22,964
Wait.

81
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,194
Besides which, the Señora
looks more like an American.

82
00:10:26,819 --> 00:10:27,920
I'm her half-brother.

83
00:10:28,438 --> 00:10:29,682
We have different mothers.

84
00:10:29,949 --> 00:10:31,222
Mine lived in Indianapolis.

85
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:32,766
Now will you please let me ..

86
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:35,352
Hello? You want to talk to her
on her room-phone perhaps?

87
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:36,795
Thank you very much.

88
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,209
Hello? Well, hello Bice.

89
00:10:40,051 --> 00:10:41,145
This is Mr Johnny.

90
00:10:41,996 --> 00:10:43,068
I'm coming right up.

91
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:44,975
Don't say anything to my sister.

92
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:48,175
Boy.

93
00:10:49,119 --> 00:10:50,936
Take this gentleman up to room 68.

94
00:10:52,195 --> 00:10:55,625
I am sorry, sir. I did not know
Madame came from Indianapolis.

95
00:10:56,241 --> 00:10:57,782
My father travelled a good deal.

96
00:11:03,821 --> 00:11:05,584
Señor Johnny.
- Hello, Bice.

97
00:11:09,874 --> 00:11:11,804
And Señor Giovanni.

98
00:11:12,212 --> 00:11:13,054
Hello.

99
00:11:13,905 --> 00:11:15,780
Where's my sister?
- On the balcony.

100
00:11:17,481 --> 00:11:18,437
I thought so.

101
00:11:19,774 --> 00:11:20,734
Johnny.

102
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:24,980
Lisa .. just exactly what is
going on around here?

103
00:11:25,232 --> 00:11:28,076
This is my little American brother.
- Oh, I've heard about you.

104
00:11:28,442 --> 00:11:30,774
I've heard about you, too.
The moment I got off the boat.

105
00:11:31,429 --> 00:11:32,681
It's a public scandal.

106
00:11:33,949 --> 00:11:36,449
You took him to live at your villa?
- Yes, Johnny dear.

107
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:39,720
Is that all you have to say?

108
00:11:40,869 --> 00:11:43,492
Carrying on like this at your age.
- At my age?

109
00:11:43,918 --> 00:11:46,312
You're twenty-five years old.
You ought to know better.

110
00:11:46,571 --> 00:11:47,631
Wait a minute, son.

111
00:11:47,952 --> 00:11:49,714
As for you? You're an American.

112
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,142
You know better too.

113
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:53,882
Let Lisa withdraw and we'll
settle this man-to-man.

114
00:11:54,933 --> 00:11:55,631
How ..

115
00:11:56,439 --> 00:11:57,625
How old are you, Johnny?

116
00:11:58,395 --> 00:11:59,482
That's irrelevant.

117
00:11:59,582 --> 00:12:02,265
Señora .. Farnham is at
the door. What can I do?

118
00:12:03,303 --> 00:12:04,182
Your manager?

119
00:12:04,282 --> 00:12:06,679
He'll be angry. He'll be furious.
He'll talk about my contract.

120
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:08,147
That's alright, sweetheart.

121
00:12:09,486 --> 00:12:10,466
Hello, Farnham.

122
00:12:10,787 --> 00:12:13,002
Oh, it's true.
- Yes, I love him.

123
00:12:13,201 --> 00:12:15,639
It is not your business, Farnham.
I have my own life.

124
00:12:16,015 --> 00:12:18,113
Now, now, Señora. Relax.

125
00:12:18,433 --> 00:12:20,173
I'm glad you've come.
- Oh, are you?

126
00:12:20,457 --> 00:12:23,062
Yes sir. You've got to save my sister.
- Save your ..?

127
00:12:25,419 --> 00:12:28,059
This is Johnny? Sit down.
Sit down, Johnny. Sit down.

128
00:12:28,953 --> 00:12:32,522
As a matter of fact, I'm in favor of a
little romance now and again. It's ..

129
00:12:33,194 --> 00:12:34,262
It helps you sing.

130
00:12:34,362 --> 00:12:37,536
Never have I sung so well.
My whole heart is in my throat.

131
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:40,629
Oh, by the way, my name is Fitzgerald.

132
00:12:41,888 --> 00:12:43,017
Howdy.
- How are you?

133
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:45,116
Hey, you two ought to
be a little more careful.

134
00:12:45,513 --> 00:12:49,212
After all, there are other places than
the most prominent hotel in Venice.

135
00:12:49,612 --> 00:12:52,050
I'll kick him out if I have to
do it with my own hands.

136
00:12:52,667 --> 00:12:54,254
We are going to have trouble with him.

137
00:12:54,638 --> 00:12:55,533
Yes, well.

138
00:12:56,557 --> 00:12:58,572
Perhaps I'd better explain.
You see .. uh ..

139
00:12:59,397 --> 00:13:01,345
Lisa and I are .. married.

140
00:13:01,793 --> 00:13:03,777
Married?
- Yes, three days ago.

141
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,958
Is that true?
- My new bride.

142
00:13:07,651 --> 00:13:09,153
Show me the marriage certificate.

143
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,322
Johnny, you nasty boy. How dare you.

144
00:13:11,939 --> 00:13:12,903
Where is it?

145
00:13:13,675 --> 00:13:15,247
Bice has it. Go and ask Bice.

146
00:13:15,481 --> 00:13:16,411
You bet I will.

147
00:13:17,044 --> 00:13:18,069
Married, eh?

148
00:13:20,951 --> 00:13:22,407
Well, that is different.

149
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,130
Sit down.
- Thank you, Farnham.

150
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,454
Do you think you can take it?
- What do you mean?

151
00:13:29,636 --> 00:13:33,466
I mean have you any idea what it is
like being married to an opera singer?

152
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:36,177
Sure. I think I'm the
luckiest man in the world.

153
00:13:36,381 --> 00:13:37,396
You'll have to be.

154
00:13:38,283 --> 00:13:40,332
Farnham. What a horrible thing to say.

155
00:13:40,538 --> 00:13:43,206
It's not talking against you,
Madame. It's your job.

156
00:13:44,506 --> 00:13:47,722
Well, I suppose I'd better catch some
more bookings for a month or so.

157
00:13:48,067 --> 00:13:50,076
We want to make this last
through the honeymoon.

158
00:13:50,176 --> 00:13:51,534
You'll do nothing of the kind.

159
00:13:52,642 --> 00:13:55,886
It's going to be a swell honeymoon,
going from city to city as Lisa sings.

160
00:13:56,415 --> 00:13:57,559
Alright, tag along.

161
00:13:58,141 --> 00:14:02,430
After you've heard those opera songs six
times you'll wish you had taken vanilla.

162
00:14:03,029 --> 00:14:04,916
That's a nice thing to say .. vanilla?

163
00:14:05,802 --> 00:14:08,702
Never mind darling. You know
it isn't true. I don't like vanilla.

164
00:14:11,298 --> 00:14:12,084
The pooch.

165
00:14:12,861 --> 00:14:15,052
Have you uh .. have you met Toto?

166
00:14:15,607 --> 00:14:16,502
Yes, why?

167
00:14:16,943 --> 00:14:19,592
Nothing. I expect from now on you ..

168
00:14:19,852 --> 00:14:22,292
You two will see a lot of each other.
- Farnham.

169
00:14:22,951 --> 00:14:24,395
I'm sorry to have been a "gloom".

170
00:14:24,728 --> 00:14:26,943
Next time I flutter in I'll
be scattering rosebuds.

171
00:14:27,624 --> 00:14:30,113
You sure there is nothing I can do?
- Yes. You can take Johnny away.

172
00:14:30,213 --> 00:14:33,022
Oh yes, and get him just a little bit
drunk. I think it will do him good.

173
00:14:33,304 --> 00:14:35,746
I've had jobs I liked better.
Have a cigarette.

174
00:14:36,866 --> 00:14:37,717
American.

175
00:14:38,395 --> 00:14:39,185
Thanks.

176
00:14:41,104 --> 00:14:43,042
Hey. Such a nice guy too.

177
00:14:45,386 --> 00:14:47,544
Can you read Italian?
Is this thing legal?

178
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:49,440
Sure it's legal. Look at the seal.

179
00:14:49,963 --> 00:14:53,049
You're coming with me, kid.
We're going to paint the town pink.

180
00:14:53,561 --> 00:14:54,890
Why pink?
- Well ..

181
00:14:55,098 --> 00:14:57,833
Pink is for little boys
and blue is for little girls.

182
00:14:59,057 --> 00:15:00,844
Personally, I prefer little girls.

183
00:15:04,942 --> 00:15:06,962
That Farnham. He spoils everything.

184
00:15:07,665 --> 00:15:08,537
No he hasn't.

185
00:15:09,792 --> 00:15:11,634
If you think it's true what he says ..

186
00:15:12,306 --> 00:15:13,953
I will give you a divorce tomorrow.

187
00:15:14,607 --> 00:15:15,812
I think he's crazy.

188
00:15:16,908 --> 00:15:18,295
And I think you're beautiful ..

189
00:15:19,495 --> 00:15:21,727
I wouldn't change places with
anybody in the whole world.

190
00:15:24,219 --> 00:15:27,194
Oh, if my career should come
in the way of our love.

191
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:28,901
It couldn't.
- I'd give it up.

192
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:30,913
It never will.

193
00:15:31,261 --> 00:15:33,224
It will turn to dust, in my hands.

194
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:34,664
I'd never let you.

195
00:15:36,883 --> 00:15:39,245
You come first .. always.

196
00:15:41,476 --> 00:15:43,506
Lisa .. whatever you like.

197
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,384
That's what I like.

198
00:15:46,467 --> 00:15:47,266
Always.

199
00:15:50,454 --> 00:15:51,226
Listen.

200
00:18:09,435 --> 00:18:11,554
Come on, come on. Come on, Toto.

201
00:20:09,281 --> 00:20:09,953
Happy?

202
00:20:10,818 --> 00:20:11,661
Ecstatic.

203
00:20:13,423 --> 00:20:16,389
Lisa, what was Mr Farnham
saying about a concert tour?

204
00:20:16,866 --> 00:20:17,738
I don't know.

205
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:20,556
He's not allowed to talk business
with me during a performance.

206
00:20:22,595 --> 00:20:23,324
Darling.

207
00:20:23,871 --> 00:20:26,145
You won't let him persuade
you to put off our trip, will you?

208
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:29,880
Oh my sweet, didn't I promise?

209
00:20:30,418 --> 00:20:31,433
You certainly did.

210
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:35,443
Tomorrow we sail for America. Your home.

211
00:20:36,502 --> 00:20:38,082
And for one long year.

212
00:20:38,499 --> 00:20:39,845
Well, for six months anyway.

213
00:20:40,461 --> 00:20:42,092
I'll be just your wife.

214
00:20:43,456 --> 00:20:44,333
Just my wife.

215
00:20:45,487 --> 00:20:48,541
Darling, I had the hotel give us the
same rooms we had on our wedding night.

216
00:20:49,912 --> 00:20:51,849
Oh you .. darling.

217
00:20:52,777 --> 00:20:55,827
And I've ordered supper just for
us two on the same little balcony.

218
00:20:57,405 --> 00:20:58,363
The same supper?

219
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,125
And the same wine.

220
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:03,573
The same moon.

221
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:08,015
I think we can do business. I hope so.

222
00:21:08,669 --> 00:21:09,843
Cigar?
- Thank you.

223
00:21:10,057 --> 00:21:11,841
Ah, Madame. Great news.

224
00:21:12,047 --> 00:21:13,810
 Hello Farnham, what are you doing here?

225
00:21:14,007 --> 00:21:16,794
Madame, these gentlemen ..
- No, no business tonight.

226
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,677
But Madame, Mr Bjorgenson
and Mr Carlson have ..

227
00:21:19,777 --> 00:21:21,717
Come all the way from
Copenhagen just to see you.

228
00:21:22,016 --> 00:21:23,048
Not tonight.

229
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:24,964
They have Catharina under contract.

230
00:21:25,203 --> 00:21:27,282
But you see Madame, she lost her voice.

231
00:21:27,554 --> 00:21:28,578
She never had one.

232
00:21:29,259 --> 00:21:32,902
I tell you. A Scandinavian tour. The
finest cities and the highest prices.

233
00:21:33,156 --> 00:21:35,203
No, no, no.

234
00:21:37,945 --> 00:21:39,309
What?
- May I come in?

235
00:21:40,034 --> 00:21:40,888
Thank you.

236
00:21:42,372 --> 00:21:45,207
Yes, I know you're tired and I
know you want to go to America.

237
00:21:45,435 --> 00:21:47,423
But this is a chance you
may never have again.

238
00:21:47,661 --> 00:21:51,163
Cities that never heard of you. You'll
have the whole Scandinavian peninsula ..

239
00:21:51,445 --> 00:21:52,718
In the hollow of your hand.

240
00:21:52,909 --> 00:21:54,124
The whole of Scandinavia?

241
00:21:54,337 --> 00:21:55,924
Yes, Catharina there, is the favorite.

242
00:21:56,177 --> 00:21:57,938
And now you can be, Madame.

243
00:21:58,872 --> 00:21:59,688
No, no, no.

244
00:21:59,914 --> 00:22:03,061
Well, at least there's no harm in
talking about it. Sit down gentlemen.

245
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:04,657
Thank you, Farnham.

246
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:06,694
Take a look at that list of engagements.

247
00:22:06,981 --> 00:22:09,319
Where's the list, Carlson?
- Bjorgenson borrowed it.

248
00:22:13,601 --> 00:22:15,009
Looks like a pretty good route.

249
00:22:18,183 --> 00:22:19,188
I cannot.

250
00:22:19,611 --> 00:22:22,962
There will be a Triumph waiting
for you in every city, Madame.

251
00:22:23,172 --> 00:22:25,200
Madame, Denmark needs you.

252
00:22:25,397 --> 00:22:27,525
And Sweden and Norway.

253
00:22:29,704 --> 00:22:31,728
That makes 75,000 kroner.

254
00:22:32,153 --> 00:22:34,701
And in Oslo Madame,
you will break their record.

255
00:22:35,005 --> 00:22:36,907
I didn't know there was
so many cities up there.

256
00:22:37,141 --> 00:22:40,406
Copenhagen, Oslo, Stockholm, Bergen.

257
00:22:40,648 --> 00:22:42,264
And the Royal Family have asked for me?

258
00:22:42,437 --> 00:22:45,211
The whole Royal Family will
be there for your Premier.

259
00:22:45,437 --> 00:22:47,903
Yes, Madame. They have asked for you.

260
00:23:20,454 --> 00:23:22,469
We stay only for Copenhagen.

261
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:24,136
Not for Oslo?

262
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:25,977
No.

263
00:23:43,341 --> 00:23:44,184
Steward.

264
00:23:47,831 --> 00:23:48,682
Check.

265
00:23:49,263 --> 00:23:51,359
Let's see how many drinks the Señor had.

266
00:23:54,155 --> 00:23:55,394
One for Copenhagen.

267
00:23:55,958 --> 00:23:57,026
One for Oslo.

268
00:23:57,704 --> 00:23:59,728
Stockholm, Bergen, and .. let me see.

269
00:24:03,694 --> 00:24:04,623
You don't mind?

270
00:24:04,728 --> 00:24:06,516
Oh no, dear. I'll need
you in a few moments.

271
00:24:08,687 --> 00:24:09,359
Flora.

272
00:24:10,762 --> 00:24:11,571
Gerald.

273
00:24:13,429 --> 00:24:15,468
I thought you were in Paris.
- Surprise.

274
00:24:16,536 --> 00:24:17,864
Come in. Come in.

275
00:24:19,653 --> 00:24:20,668
Where's your wife?

276
00:24:21,276 --> 00:24:23,204
We must get a table together
in the dining-room.

277
00:24:24,696 --> 00:24:26,887
My wife .. couldn't sail .. just yet.

278
00:24:27,711 --> 00:24:28,571
Really?

279
00:24:29,569 --> 00:24:30,231
Yes.

280
00:24:31,863 --> 00:24:32,607
Waiter.

281
00:24:33,068 --> 00:24:34,397
What will you have to drink?

282
00:24:34,497 --> 00:24:36,924
I've been drinking one for each
of the Scandinavian cities.

283
00:24:37,551 --> 00:24:39,348
A Manhattan.
- Two.

284
00:24:39,774 --> 00:24:40,678
Si Señor.

285
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:42,904
For Manhattan.

286
00:25:45,023 --> 00:25:45,666
Ahh!

287
00:25:45,909 --> 00:25:46,803
Impossible.

288
00:25:48,184 --> 00:25:49,130
Bad news?

289
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,165
He wants ..

290
00:25:56,373 --> 00:25:57,502
He wants to leave me.

291
00:26:02,859 --> 00:26:05,864
Are you thoroughly convinced
of your incompatibility?

292
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:08,592
Well, he wouldn't be here
otherwise, would you darling?

293
00:26:08,922 --> 00:26:09,657
Hardly.

294
00:26:10,007 --> 00:26:12,265
Well, we won't have any difficulty
about getting a divorce.

295
00:26:13,133 --> 00:26:14,663
That was the stock question of mine.

296
00:26:15,167 --> 00:26:17,251
Sort-of last chance to reconsider.

297
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:19,285
No, no, I don't want to reconsider.

298
00:26:19,926 --> 00:26:21,385
I'm glad it's over.

299
00:26:21,889 --> 00:26:22,761
Too unwieldy.

300
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,015
It was a ..

301
00:26:24,872 --> 00:26:26,400
Well, sort of a charming nightmare.

302
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:33,387
Say, have you any conception of what
my married life has been, Mr Massey?

303
00:26:34,171 --> 00:26:36,222
Perpetually bustling across
the face of the earth.

304
00:26:36,477 --> 00:26:38,501
Spending all your waking
hours in hotel lobbies.

305
00:26:38,601 --> 00:26:40,689
Or in the babble of the
backstage at an opera house.

306
00:26:41,653 --> 00:26:45,003
Never free, even in your own hotel
room, from the trillings and tootings ..

307
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:47,408
Of the Prima donna's friends and ..

308
00:26:47,999 --> 00:26:49,289
Her musical entourage.

309
00:26:50,018 --> 00:26:51,347
Press agents and admirers.

310
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:56,078
You ever had your picture taken sitting
on a truck with a dog and a parrot?

311
00:26:56,408 --> 00:26:57,476
No.

312
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:01,113
Half the time, in the newspapers I was
referred to as "Mr Gerald Della Robbia".

313
00:27:01,374 --> 00:27:02,940
Are you taking this down, Miss Stone?

314
00:27:03,357 --> 00:27:04,115
Yes, sir.

315
00:27:18,898 --> 00:27:20,342
Perhaps the bell is out of order.

316
00:27:22,292 --> 00:27:23,998
It's open. We'll just walk in.

317
00:27:24,289 --> 00:27:26,338
Do you think we'd better?
- Sure. Come on.

318
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,575
Highball?

319
00:27:32,675 --> 00:27:34,507
No thanks dear, but you have one.
- Right.

320
00:27:35,108 --> 00:27:36,225
Hmm, this is nice.

321
00:27:38,118 --> 00:27:39,512
I'll make you happy, Gerald.

322
00:27:39,927 --> 00:27:41,194
Oh, I know you will Flora.

323
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:43,061
We are ideally mated, we two.

324
00:27:43,435 --> 00:27:44,876
We want the same things.

325
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:48,000
Permanence .. stability .. comfort.

326
00:27:48,964 --> 00:27:50,445
Yes, and peace of mind.

327
00:27:53,241 --> 00:27:54,963
You never had that with her, did you?

328
00:27:55,871 --> 00:27:59,011
To Lisa, our marriage was a game she
played when she had nothing else to do.

329
00:28:00,886 --> 00:28:02,629
To me, it wasn't a game.
It was solitaire.

330
00:28:03,558 --> 00:28:04,643
Poor darling.

331
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,123
Well.

332
00:28:11,421 --> 00:28:12,411
What on earth?

333
00:28:12,511 --> 00:28:14,316
Does this sort of thing
go on all the time?

334
00:28:14,416 --> 00:28:17,412
Look here, you impossible young ..
- You always kiss people, don't you.

335
00:28:18,176 --> 00:28:21,396
You always pop up in places unexpectedly
and always jumping to wrong conclusions.

336
00:28:21,645 --> 00:28:22,973
There's only one conclusion.

337
00:28:23,694 --> 00:28:26,282
You and this woman.
- Gerald, explain to him immediately.

338
00:28:27,845 --> 00:28:29,805
This is Mrs Preston, my future wife.

339
00:28:30,812 --> 00:28:32,340
I thought my sister was your wife.

340
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:35,198
Yeah, well, I'm divorcing your sister.

341
00:28:35,763 --> 00:28:36,474
What?

342
00:28:36,822 --> 00:28:39,316
What are you doing here anyway?
And who is this young lady?

343
00:28:39,817 --> 00:28:40,973
Miss Aline Chalmers.

344
00:28:41,073 --> 00:28:42,517
How do you do.
- How do you do.

345
00:28:42,617 --> 00:28:43,706
Don't speak to him.

346
00:28:44,192 --> 00:28:45,538
She's <i>my</i> future wife.

347
00:28:46,572 --> 00:28:47,800
Nice of you to drop in.

348
00:28:48,109 --> 00:28:49,533
I brought her here to meet Lisa.

349
00:28:50,211 --> 00:28:50,897
Here?

350
00:28:51,331 --> 00:28:54,268
Aline's family think it's bad enough
that my sister is on the stage.

351
00:28:54,986 --> 00:28:57,203
What will they say when they
find out she's being divorced?

352
00:28:57,809 --> 00:28:59,278
I don't know. What will they say?

353
00:28:59,996 --> 00:29:02,618
They won't care really.
That's just Johnny's idea.

354
00:29:03,964 --> 00:29:05,408
You don't know life the way I do.

355
00:29:07,877 --> 00:29:09,019
Where is Lisa?

356
00:29:09,346 --> 00:29:12,100
The last I heard she was in London.
What made you suppose she'd be here?

357
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:15,350
Lisa sent me a wireless this morning.
She arrives on the Berengaria today.

358
00:29:15,777 --> 00:29:16,477
Today?

359
00:29:16,577 --> 00:29:18,903
Yes, I got in from Newhaven too
late to meet her at the dock.

360
00:29:19,207 --> 00:29:21,817
I expected she'd be here by this
time. Instead, I find her here.

361
00:29:21,995 --> 00:29:22,730
Really?

362
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,569
That will do Johnny. Show me the cable.

363
00:29:24,959 --> 00:29:25,767
Tamamoto.

364
00:29:27,373 --> 00:29:29,285
Well, this does sound
as if she's coming here.

365
00:29:29,481 --> 00:29:30,464
You didn't know?

366
00:29:30,662 --> 00:29:32,868
No, she hasn't found time to
answer my cablegrams.

367
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:34,215
Sir?

368
00:29:34,315 --> 00:29:36,314
Madame is coming. Get things ready.
- Yes, sir.

369
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:39,659
You don't mind if we wait here for her?
- No. Sit down some place. Here.

370
00:29:40,068 --> 00:29:40,997
I'll run along.

371
00:29:41,258 --> 00:29:43,090
Yes, yes darling.
Well, I guess you'd better.

372
00:29:43,272 --> 00:29:46,199
And Tamamoto, put some flowers around
the place. You know, plenty of flowers.

373
00:29:46,406 --> 00:29:47,287
Oh yes, sir.

374
00:29:47,562 --> 00:29:50,496
Well, I think I'd better move to the
club. Lisa will take this place over.

375
00:29:50,795 --> 00:29:54,071
Perhaps I should send some flowers too?
There's an Italian florist downstairs.

376
00:29:54,358 --> 00:29:56,428
He has such lovely, clever ideas.

377
00:29:56,646 --> 00:29:59,589
Oh swell, sure. We might as well
keep the thing as friendly as possible.

378
00:30:00,145 --> 00:30:00,903
Friendly?

379
00:30:01,206 --> 00:30:01,878
Judas.

380
00:30:02,447 --> 00:30:04,349
That's what he is. A cut-rate Judas.

381
00:30:04,696 --> 00:30:06,563
Come on, come on.
- Hello, Bice.

382
00:30:07,006 --> 00:30:09,151
Well, we did arrive quick. Ha.

383
00:30:10,566 --> 00:30:12,035
Hello Archimedes.

384
00:30:14,243 --> 00:30:16,214
Mama-mia, I have forgot the bird.

385
00:30:30,343 --> 00:30:32,531
Was it always like this?
- Always.

386
00:30:33,686 --> 00:30:35,986
Goodbye darling. Call me when
you get settled at the club.

387
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:37,647
Alright sweet. Bye-bye.

388
00:30:48,149 --> 00:30:49,769
How was Monte Carlo?

389
00:30:50,071 --> 00:30:52,125
We have a little trouble with
the Customs Inspector.

390
00:30:53,222 --> 00:30:55,112
And Mr Farnham is our guru.

391
00:30:55,994 --> 00:30:57,123
This is Bice .. Aline.

392
00:30:58,685 --> 00:31:02,692
No, no, no. This stay here.
You open them on the floor. Quick.

393
00:31:03,005 --> 00:31:05,023
No understand.
- Presto, presto.

394
00:31:07,964 --> 00:31:09,823
Tamamoto, you have to
do what Bice tells you.

395
00:31:13,739 --> 00:31:16,231
But of course, you can take
the pillows and the scarf.

396
00:31:16,331 --> 00:31:17,312
I will arrange.

397
00:31:17,412 --> 00:31:19,314
Where do the pictures go, Bice?
- On the table.

398
00:31:19,517 --> 00:31:21,811
Madame, she likes to have
her friends all about her.

399
00:31:22,147 --> 00:31:23,301
And her flowers.

400
00:31:25,846 --> 00:31:27,346
Presto. I will arrange.

401
00:31:28,267 --> 00:31:31,888
You come with me. Get the basket.
And clear all the things from the table.

402
00:31:32,103 --> 00:31:32,757
Hey.

403
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:37,527
Go quick.

404
00:31:37,783 --> 00:31:39,999
Bice, where do these go?
- In Madame's room.

405
00:31:45,459 --> 00:31:48,306
All these smoking things
is bad for her voice.

406
00:31:50,616 --> 00:31:51,795
Bice, have a heart.

407
00:31:53,701 --> 00:31:55,965
There you go.
- Yes, there I go.

408
00:31:59,331 --> 00:32:00,432
They came for Madame.

409
00:32:02,486 --> 00:32:05,058
Holy Moses. Who's responsible for that?

410
00:32:08,866 --> 00:32:11,249
Don't let her see that. She will scream.

411
00:32:11,459 --> 00:32:14,441
It appears like a funeral.
- Perhaps it was made for one.

412
00:32:14,722 --> 00:32:16,131
Flora Preston.

413
00:32:17,323 --> 00:32:18,207
Who's that?

414
00:32:18,498 --> 00:32:20,132
Oh, a friend, Bice.

415
00:32:24,972 --> 00:32:26,119
Put it on the mantle.

416
00:32:26,381 --> 00:32:27,781
On the?
- On the mantle.

417
00:32:28,033 --> 00:32:29,940
Oh .. oh.

418
00:32:33,902 --> 00:32:36,184
Ah .. a little dead bird in the middle.

419
00:32:37,292 --> 00:32:38,532
That's bad luck.

420
00:32:39,358 --> 00:32:41,152
Ah. .. I forgot.

421
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:43,243
Well, what's the matter with him?

422
00:32:45,217 --> 00:32:46,048
Now what?

423
00:32:49,719 --> 00:32:51,255
Wait a minute. What's going on here?

424
00:32:51,734 --> 00:32:54,277
Where are my cook? Where are
my table-boys? I want to know.

425
00:32:54,576 --> 00:32:56,934
Put down that knife.
- I am cook. My kitchen here.

426
00:32:57,459 --> 00:32:58,903
You too. Put down that knife.

427
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:04,577
He come in my kitchen,
he push me around.

428
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:08,078
Shut up! Shut up! One at a time.

429
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:09,699
You see.

430
00:33:09,933 --> 00:33:11,735
Without me .. Madame, she die.

431
00:33:12,243 --> 00:33:15,557
She cannot eat the mess of
this foreign gentleman here.

432
00:33:15,905 --> 00:33:17,536
And yet, he has the machine.

433
00:33:17,794 --> 00:33:20,158
How can we cook together?
- I am cook in this place.

434
00:33:20,258 --> 00:33:21,545
Don't come in kitchen.

435
00:33:21,645 --> 00:33:25,138
But Madame, she cannot
eat you. She want me, me.

436
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,636
Look in heaven. Do I cook in my hat?

437
00:33:28,574 --> 00:33:31,364
Yes. Well, Tamamoto, during the
stay of Madame Della Robbia ..

438
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,045
Her chef will do the cooking.

439
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:36,365
I do not like noise.

440
00:33:36,741 --> 00:33:38,675
Yes, well. I'm terribly sorry Tamamoto.

441
00:33:38,775 --> 00:33:40,515
But I guess we'll have
to put up with it.

442
00:33:43,417 --> 00:33:44,459
No can do.

443
00:33:45,054 --> 00:33:45,806
No!

444
00:33:47,374 --> 00:33:49,947
Oh .. heaven bless our happy home.

445
00:33:50,783 --> 00:33:51,655
Enter Madame.

446
00:33:52,058 --> 00:33:53,682
Archimedes .. she come.

447
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,548
Johnny.

448
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:01,351
Lisa.

449
00:34:03,445 --> 00:34:04,281
Johnny.

450
00:34:04,731 --> 00:34:07,005
Gee Lisa, you look slick.
Doesn't she, Aline?

451
00:34:07,671 --> 00:34:08,620
This is Aline.

452
00:34:09,296 --> 00:34:10,817
You know. Aline Chalmers.

453
00:34:11,662 --> 00:34:13,869
Ah .. first love.

454
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:16,620
Young love .. isn't it sweet.

455
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,730
Sweet child, I want to hear
the timbre of you voice.

456
00:34:21,275 --> 00:34:22,817
I hardly know what to say.

457
00:34:24,552 --> 00:34:25,830
A very light soprano.

458
00:34:27,031 --> 00:34:28,186
Perhaps it will grow.

459
00:34:34,964 --> 00:34:35,791
Gerald.

460
00:34:36,091 --> 00:34:37,106
How are you, Lisa?

461
00:34:41,462 --> 00:34:43,040
Are you surprised that I came?

462
00:34:43,636 --> 00:34:45,119
Well, you might have let me know.

463
00:34:45,777 --> 00:34:47,135
I might have done many things.

464
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,261
But the sound of my own voice
singing silly little tunes ..

465
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:52,215
It deafens me to the rush of life.

466
00:34:52,477 --> 00:34:54,384
Passing by me like a sweet stream.

467
00:34:58,092 --> 00:34:59,246
Of course, I forgot.

468
00:34:59,875 --> 00:35:00,927
This is America.

469
00:35:01,227 --> 00:35:03,225
Here, when the heart
speaks, the lips say ..

470
00:35:03,472 --> 00:35:04,963
"Fine weather we are having."

471
00:35:05,575 --> 00:35:07,632
I imagine that's just
what your life is like.

472
00:35:07,857 --> 00:35:08,729
A swift wind.

473
00:35:09,416 --> 00:35:10,831
They were only silly words.

474
00:35:11,376 --> 00:35:13,116
It was charming of you to greet me.

475
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,110
I think we'll be going Lisa.

476
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:16,787
May I come again, please?

477
00:35:16,943 --> 00:35:18,624
Of course. Goodbye.

478
00:35:19,037 --> 00:35:21,741
Goodbye Lisa. I'll call you.
- Au revoir, mes enfants.

479
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:25,042
Bice.

480
00:35:26,056 --> 00:35:26,901
Bice.

481
00:35:27,446 --> 00:35:29,268
Where are my servants, Bice?

482
00:35:31,314 --> 00:35:33,980
For hours you leave me with
my hat and furs. Here, take it.

483
00:35:34,365 --> 00:35:35,699
Hold it, boys. Hold it.

484
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:38,457
Farnham.
- Pardon me, boys.

485
00:35:38,557 --> 00:35:41,290
Pardon me. Here are those
few trifles you left me with.

486
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:42,468
Thank you, Farnham.

487
00:35:42,568 --> 00:35:43,955
Well boys, I guess ..
- Hello.

488
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:47,766
Oh hello, Mr Fitzgerald.
- Hello Farnham. How are you?

489
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:50,457
Merry and bright. Merry and bright.

490
00:35:51,894 --> 00:35:53,759
And uh .. and you?

491
00:35:54,435 --> 00:35:56,017
Oh uh, fine. Fine thanks.

492
00:35:56,573 --> 00:35:58,325
Have a cigarette .. American.

493
00:35:58,617 --> 00:36:00,570
Thanks .. I'm just out.

494
00:36:01,856 --> 00:36:04,159
Now, if you'll show me where
to put these little knick-knacks.

495
00:36:04,302 --> 00:36:05,260
Okay, follow me.

496
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:25,747
Ah Señora, please.

497
00:36:27,625 --> 00:36:30,262
You must drink this at once.
I command it.

498
00:36:30,723 --> 00:36:34,516
And then, completely you must
rest two or three hours. Si?

499
00:36:34,873 --> 00:36:37,558
Ah Dottore, life demands
that I be strong.

500
00:36:37,765 --> 00:36:38,982
With rest comes strength.

501
00:36:39,161 --> 00:36:41,011
Yes, you must be tired, Lisa.
I'll run along.

502
00:36:41,227 --> 00:36:41,982
Si si.

503
00:36:42,326 --> 00:36:44,696
I hope the place is comfortable for you.
- Where are you going?

504
00:36:46,114 --> 00:36:47,444
I'm staying over at the club.

505
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,195
Oh yes, yes.

506
00:36:50,388 --> 00:36:51,521
Oh, my head.

507
00:36:52,132 --> 00:36:54,207
But this tonic always helps you.

508
00:36:56,883 --> 00:36:58,296
There is so much I have to do.

509
00:36:58,733 --> 00:37:01,301
Later I am quiet. But now I
must speak with my husband.

510
00:37:01,625 --> 00:37:03,808
Oh no, Lisa. There is
plenty of time for that.

511
00:37:06,733 --> 00:37:08,497
Alright, Dottore. I take the medicine.

512
00:37:08,756 --> 00:37:10,446
Subito.
- I take it.

513
00:37:11,761 --> 00:37:12,547
I promise.

514
00:37:13,704 --> 00:37:14,784
Faithfully.

515
00:37:28,592 --> 00:37:30,085
Mama-mia, Gerald.

516
00:37:31,268 --> 00:37:32,986
Did you bring that thing for my grave?

517
00:37:34,188 --> 00:37:37,407
Well, no Lisa, Mrs Preston
of whom I wrote to you ..

518
00:37:37,699 --> 00:37:39,473
Ah .. I see.

519
00:37:39,914 --> 00:37:42,478
She sends a peace offering.
The little dove.

520
00:37:43,821 --> 00:37:45,289
She's subtle, this lady.

521
00:37:45,704 --> 00:37:47,489
Oh you will twist things your own way.

522
00:37:47,826 --> 00:37:50,121
She did it to be kind, to welcome you.
That sort of thing.

523
00:37:50,221 --> 00:37:51,265
That sort of thing.

524
00:37:53,174 --> 00:37:55,962
Oh Gerald, it's wonderful
to have it here in the room.

525
00:37:57,465 --> 00:37:58,509
So that's her view.

526
00:37:58,799 --> 00:38:00,888
Oh, nothing of the sort.
She left it to the florist.

527
00:38:01,522 --> 00:38:02,358
Probably.

528
00:38:03,738 --> 00:38:05,806
I doubt it .. never mind.

529
00:38:07,186 --> 00:38:09,749
I understand. I am a woman of the world.

530
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:12,459
We shall talk this over quietly.

531
00:38:13,246 --> 00:38:14,490
Yeah, that's more like it.

532
00:38:15,019 --> 00:38:17,685
Good luck. Mon ami. More, bon ami.

533
00:38:18,371 --> 00:38:20,156
Shake hands en Anglais.

534
00:38:21,423 --> 00:38:22,879
I am your friend, Lisa.

535
00:38:23,433 --> 00:38:25,882
To me, you're still the most
fascinating woman in the world.

536
00:38:26,821 --> 00:38:27,986
Oh, thank you.

537
00:38:29,873 --> 00:38:32,319
That makes it easier for me
to tell you my little story.

538
00:38:32,967 --> 00:38:34,576
The real reason for my coming.

539
00:38:35,432 --> 00:38:36,277
What now?

540
00:38:37,657 --> 00:38:39,940
Your letter arrived at the
most opportune moment.

541
00:38:40,731 --> 00:38:42,222
I also have met someone.

542
00:38:42,825 --> 00:38:43,445
Ha?

543
00:38:44,869 --> 00:38:45,864
He's marvellous.

544
00:38:46,155 --> 00:38:48,765
Not yet twenty but a great poet.

545
00:38:49,413 --> 00:38:51,567
No money he have.
No jewels to bring to me.

546
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:54,437
Just his heart, and his
poems he lay at my feet.

547
00:38:55,655 --> 00:38:57,479
When you write me about
the American lady ..

548
00:38:57,579 --> 00:39:00,659
I say: "All is well.
Soon, I too can marry."

549
00:39:01,861 --> 00:39:03,091
A poet?
- Uhuh.

550
00:39:04,387 --> 00:39:06,640
Oh Lisa, I don't believe a word of it.

551
00:39:08,246 --> 00:39:09,773
You don't believe it?
- No.

552
00:39:12,279 --> 00:39:14,542
You then are the only one
who has "yearnings".

553
00:39:15,011 --> 00:39:16,470
You are tired of romance.

554
00:39:17,011 --> 00:39:20,005
You long for peace,
for quiet, for old slippers.

555
00:39:20,615 --> 00:39:23,226
What am I to do with these
things? You leave me all alone.

556
00:39:23,629 --> 00:39:24,649
I leave you alone?

557
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:28,465
I am Lisa Della Robbia.
I starve for romance, for poetry.

558
00:39:28,855 --> 00:39:31,274
You come here to watch over
your business. Your business.

559
00:39:31,506 --> 00:39:34,060
Very well. When I find these
romantic things, I take them.

560
00:39:34,459 --> 00:39:35,809
Don't be such a fool, Lisa.

561
00:39:36,057 --> 00:39:38,912
I Lisa Della Robbia is to be
cast aside like an old shoe?

562
00:39:39,122 --> 00:39:41,115
To live alone. To die alone.

563
00:39:41,469 --> 00:39:45,023
All of a sudden, a pressure for romance.
This melodrama about dying alone.

564
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:47,332
I begged you to settle down
and what did you answer me?

565
00:39:47,464 --> 00:39:49,127
Can I help it if I love someone else?

566
00:39:49,549 --> 00:39:52,378
I am Della Robbia. Love is
my master and my slave.

567
00:39:52,613 --> 00:39:54,294
Oh stop it, Lisa. Stop acting!

568
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:58,183
You've been the baby-wonder of the opera
for a long time. Now you listen to me.

569
00:39:59,364 --> 00:40:01,581
You've been petted and spoiled.
You've done as you pleased.

570
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:05,737
I always catered to your whims, but I'll
not see you making a fool of yourself.

571
00:40:05,925 --> 00:40:06,511
Oh.

572
00:40:06,855 --> 00:40:08,592
A poet .. a new plaything.

573
00:40:09,315 --> 00:40:11,846
You're a conceited child and it's time
you grew up. You're old enough.

574
00:40:12,717 --> 00:40:14,574
Am I then so very old, Gerald?

575
00:40:15,551 --> 00:40:16,772
Too old for you to love.

576
00:40:17,532 --> 00:40:18,490
And to love you?

577
00:40:19,309 --> 00:40:20,661
No, Lisa, I do love you.

578
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:22,970
And I'm grateful to you.

579
00:40:23,543 --> 00:40:26,259
Why you've been exquisite,
magnificent, ideal.

580
00:40:27,198 --> 00:40:28,070
To play with.

581
00:40:29,123 --> 00:40:29,831
Gerald.

582
00:40:30,072 --> 00:40:32,146
Have you the faintest idea
what it means to be a wife?

583
00:40:33,058 --> 00:40:33,941
Gerald!

584
00:40:35,387 --> 00:40:37,081
I mean it, from the bottom of my heart.

585
00:40:38,292 --> 00:40:40,957
I'll never forgive you for saying
that the longest day I live.

586
00:40:41,916 --> 00:40:43,500
Very well then .. divorce!

587
00:40:44,072 --> 00:40:45,603
Divorce. You shall have it.

588
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:49,988
I wish I had it here now, that I might
throw it in your sneering face!

589
00:40:56,936 --> 00:40:57,722
Thank you.

590
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:11,991
Ahh!

591
00:41:23,951 --> 00:41:26,306
This broth will give
you strength, Madame.

592
00:41:29,611 --> 00:41:31,227
This will make you sleep.

593
00:41:31,855 --> 00:41:34,353
Look Madame. Look what I get for you.

594
00:41:34,579 --> 00:41:35,809
Isn't it beautiful.

595
00:41:36,062 --> 00:41:36,738
No!

596
00:41:38,269 --> 00:41:41,275
Now, now Madame, if you'll
only let me talk business ..

597
00:41:41,811 --> 00:41:42,487
No.

598
00:41:43,097 --> 00:41:43,883
Would you?

599
00:41:44,127 --> 00:41:45,451
Get me my kneeling pad.

600
00:41:46,277 --> 00:41:48,709
What you need is to get
your mind off these things.

601
00:41:48,935 --> 00:41:50,394
New surroundings, hard work.

602
00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:53,085
Now, I've got a South
American tour up my sleeve.

603
00:41:53,581 --> 00:41:55,010
Oh, Madame.
- No.

604
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,261
And before we sail.

605
00:41:56,361 --> 00:41:59,885
I think I can arrange for one guest
performance here at the opera.

606
00:42:01,287 --> 00:42:02,263
Oh bellissimo.

607
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:03,749
How would you like it?

608
00:42:04,517 --> 00:42:05,235
No.

609
00:42:06,254 --> 00:42:07,535
I will never sing again.

610
00:42:08,243 --> 00:42:09,267
Well, of course.

611
00:42:09,896 --> 00:42:11,655
If you're going to let
this thing lick you.

612
00:42:13,007 --> 00:42:14,109
Who said I would?

613
00:42:14,209 --> 00:42:17,535
Why regret? Just because
another dame steals your husband.

614
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:22,379
She hasn't stolen him yet.
And she won't.

615
00:42:23,746 --> 00:42:24,927
Wait and see.

616
00:42:26,082 --> 00:42:27,411
What are you going to do now?

617
00:42:28,551 --> 00:42:31,108
This is war. And I have not quit.

618
00:42:32,085 --> 00:42:33,616
I have only begun to fight.

619
00:42:34,545 --> 00:42:35,780
Okay, Gerald.

620
00:42:37,893 --> 00:42:39,490
First thing, we move.
- Move?

621
00:42:39,725 --> 00:42:41,467
Not one night will I
spend under his roof.

622
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:43,508
But Madame ..
- My things. Pack them.

623
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:45,746
Quick. To work everyone. Quick.

624
00:42:46,328 --> 00:42:48,130
Archimedes.
- Si, Señora.

625
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:51,013
Pack everything.
Leave nothing that is mine.

626
00:42:51,314 --> 00:42:52,281
But Señora ..

627
00:42:57,455 --> 00:42:59,148
The preliminary decree.

628
00:42:59,659 --> 00:43:01,200
Then she is divorced?

629
00:43:02,653 --> 00:43:04,942
The decree becomes
absolute in six months.

630
00:43:05,748 --> 00:43:07,550
Then .. she is not divorced?

631
00:43:08,011 --> 00:43:09,341
Just a formality.

632
00:43:09,775 --> 00:43:11,449
Then she <i>is</i> divorced.

633
00:43:11,725 --> 00:43:14,928
Certainly, they're divorced.
Only it isn't .. quite right.

634
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:17,835
Who will tell her?

635
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:19,574
Not me.

636
00:43:21,013 --> 00:43:24,452
Ah .. I have it .. you tell her.

637
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:27,220
Now let's see.

638
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:29,540
Spirit of ammonia.

639
00:43:29,812 --> 00:43:34,244
And perhaps I will even go so far
as a mild injection of morphine.

640
00:43:34,795 --> 00:43:35,735
Very mild.

641
00:43:36,408 --> 00:43:39,362
I will cook her risotto.
That will be better.

642
00:43:40,442 --> 00:43:41,400
I will cook her.

643
00:43:42,322 --> 00:43:43,691
Oh, you all.

644
00:43:44,852 --> 00:43:46,567
You don't know her as I know.

645
00:43:47,006 --> 00:43:51,439
Every night she cries herself
to sleep, on my breast.

646
00:43:53,052 --> 00:43:54,190
"Bice", she say.

647
00:43:54,945 --> 00:43:58,148
"When I leave this house,
I think you follow me."

648
00:43:59,773 --> 00:44:01,273
Every night she say:

649
00:44:01,888 --> 00:44:04,476
"Perhaps he comes tomorrow."

650
00:44:05,486 --> 00:44:08,667
And I said: "but Madame, why don't
you speak to him when he calls?"

651
00:44:10,099 --> 00:44:12,151
And she said:
"Well, perhaps he comes anyway."

652
00:44:12,769 --> 00:44:14,776
"Perhaps he break in the door."

653
00:44:15,508 --> 00:44:16,610
Break in the door?

654
00:44:18,073 --> 00:44:21,384
She would not open the door
to him. After what he do.

655
00:44:22,567 --> 00:44:26,409
But she wanted him to
break it in, and say:

656
00:44:26,898 --> 00:44:30,937
"Lisa, you are like the sun in my life."

657
00:44:31,958 --> 00:44:35,675
"I cannot live in this great darkness."

658
00:44:36,911 --> 00:44:38,571
But he never comes.

659
00:44:41,495 --> 00:44:43,175
Now it is too late.

660
00:44:47,344 --> 00:44:48,499
Now she comes.

661
00:44:49,265 --> 00:44:51,754
Oh, it's alright. The sun
is shining this morning.

662
00:44:52,549 --> 00:44:54,304
Once again, positive?

663
00:44:54,894 --> 00:44:57,094
Good morning.
- Good morning, Señora.

664
00:44:57,499 --> 00:44:59,348
All is well with my little family?

665
00:44:59,913 --> 00:45:02,350
All is fine ..
- Alright, Madame.

666
00:45:04,671 --> 00:45:06,641
What is wrong with all of you?

667
00:45:12,877 --> 00:45:15,859
No matter what has happened,
never look like that. Never.

668
00:45:16,243 --> 00:45:18,401
Come out. Out with it.

669
00:45:19,515 --> 00:45:20,247
Well ..

670
00:45:21,546 --> 00:45:25,402
Madame, the preliminary
decree has been granted.

671
00:45:36,452 --> 00:45:38,501
He did not break in the door.

672
00:45:43,587 --> 00:45:46,303
My dears .. my friends.

673
00:45:47,545 --> 00:45:48,943
I'm so worried about me.

674
00:45:49,529 --> 00:45:51,775
How lucky I am to be so blessed.

675
00:46:02,633 --> 00:46:03,785
Thank you.

676
00:46:04,609 --> 00:46:07,007
There .. there, that's enough.

677
00:46:07,754 --> 00:46:09,499
All is not over, no.

678
00:46:09,831 --> 00:46:11,708
Archimedes, open a bottle of wine.

679
00:46:11,978 --> 00:46:13,961
Drink my health.
- Si Señora.

680
00:46:17,038 --> 00:46:20,020
I will be alone with Farnham.
- Si, Señora.

681
00:46:23,166 --> 00:46:24,100
Well.

682
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:32,579
You are an amazing woman, Madame.

683
00:46:33,656 --> 00:46:36,164
You never do what is expected of you.

684
00:46:38,288 --> 00:46:41,450
No one ever does what is expected
of them. It is such a puzzle.

685
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:51,002
They say there are great, pitch-black
spaces between the stars.

686
00:46:52,388 --> 00:46:54,892
I think they are between people too.

687
00:46:56,911 --> 00:46:58,326
Like pitch.

688
00:47:01,355 --> 00:47:02,505
Pitch-black.

689
00:47:04,013 --> 00:47:06,345
Pitch .. very pitch.

690
00:47:10,765 --> 00:47:12,129
I must dress.

691
00:47:17,055 --> 00:47:19,469
Go and make a speech to them,
Farnham. Make them laugh.

692
00:47:21,442 --> 00:47:22,701
Make them laugh.

693
00:47:58,771 --> 00:48:00,609
She cries. What we do?

694
00:48:00,709 --> 00:48:02,909
There is one thing you can
do, but you won't do it.

695
00:48:03,258 --> 00:48:04,960
What's that?
- Pretend you don't hear it.

696
00:48:06,275 --> 00:48:08,126
Oh Giovanni.

697
00:48:08,649 --> 00:48:11,708
Johnny, Johnny, she
cries out her heartache.

698
00:48:12,258 --> 00:48:13,377
What's the matter?

699
00:48:13,639 --> 00:48:15,322
Preliminary decree blues.

700
00:48:15,972 --> 00:48:16,807
Oh ..

701
00:48:26,126 --> 00:48:27,530
Don't let it worry you, Sis'.

702
00:48:29,219 --> 00:48:31,215
You oughtn't to come
when I look like this.

703
00:48:31,482 --> 00:48:32,944
That's what brothers are for.

704
00:48:35,590 --> 00:48:38,614
If only I could have seen
him once more. Just once.

705
00:48:39,519 --> 00:48:41,940
I guess Mrs Preston fixed that?
- Yes.

706
00:48:42,682 --> 00:48:45,081
It is full of cold, ugly words.

707
00:48:46,408 --> 00:48:48,904
What does that mean?
When the decree is final?

708
00:48:50,206 --> 00:48:52,024
Well, you see, you're
not quite divorced yet.

709
00:48:52,785 --> 00:48:53,371
No?

710
00:48:53,589 --> 00:48:56,120
No. The law requires both
parties to wait six months.

711
00:48:56,572 --> 00:48:58,251
Just in case you change your mind.

712
00:48:59,601 --> 00:49:02,411
Well, Gerald will not change his mind.

713
00:49:05,036 --> 00:49:06,907
You love him a lot, don't you Sis'?

714
00:49:08,494 --> 00:49:10,316
How else can I sing of love?

715
00:49:12,268 --> 00:49:15,646
Probably doesn't do Gerald much good
if you sing to him and he's not there.

716
00:49:17,113 --> 00:49:18,877
I don't know, I don't know.

717
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:22,048
I only know that I am unhappy.

718
00:49:22,858 --> 00:49:24,158
What am I to do?

719
00:49:24,571 --> 00:49:25,894
What can I do?

720
00:49:26,347 --> 00:49:29,803
I've thought of many ways to win him
back but Gerald is not like other men.

721
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:31,461
He pricks my little bubbles.

722
00:49:31,764 --> 00:49:34,519
He says: "Come on Lisa,
come on. Don't act."

723
00:49:36,221 --> 00:49:37,856
What am I to do?

724
00:49:38,296 --> 00:49:39,275
Here ..

725
00:49:39,909 --> 00:49:41,146
Blow your nose.

726
00:49:44,377 --> 00:49:45,238
What is it?

727
00:49:45,582 --> 00:49:47,386
Your husband's lawyer is on the phone.

728
00:49:48,066 --> 00:49:49,294
Gerald is there.

729
00:49:50,644 --> 00:49:54,379
They wonder if you can come down for
some sort of a financial conference.

730
00:49:54,915 --> 00:49:56,763
I guess I can cancel if you want me to.

731
00:49:57,087 --> 00:49:59,243
Gerald is there?
- That is what they said.

732
00:50:01,033 --> 00:50:03,226
Bice. .. Bicenza.

733
00:50:03,946 --> 00:50:05,299
Bicenza, quick.

734
00:50:05,399 --> 00:50:06,817
I'll tell them you're coming.

735
00:50:07,103 --> 00:50:08,214
Si Señora?

736
00:50:10,061 --> 00:50:13,826
Mr Fitzgerald is upset over your refusal
to accept any financial settlement.

737
00:50:14,099 --> 00:50:14,962
Oh really?

738
00:50:15,779 --> 00:50:17,419
So I asked you to meet him here.

739
00:50:18,315 --> 00:50:19,321
Thank you.

740
00:50:20,465 --> 00:50:21,914
You didn't answer my phone calls.

741
00:50:22,277 --> 00:50:24,981
Well, I'll leave you to
discuss things alone.

742
00:50:28,465 --> 00:50:29,671
Isn't Flora here?

743
00:50:31,014 --> 00:50:32,350
Why should she be here?

744
00:50:32,572 --> 00:50:36,242
She is your future wife. She should be
interested in your financial affairs.

745
00:50:36,619 --> 00:50:39,690
Really, it's no business of Flora's.
- Oh but Gerald, it is.

746
00:50:40,382 --> 00:50:43,172
Every wife should be interested in what
her husband does with his money.

747
00:50:43,849 --> 00:50:46,196
I know I wasn't .. but I was a failure.

748
00:50:46,431 --> 00:50:48,932
Now look Lisa, why do you
always make things so difficult?

749
00:50:49,123 --> 00:50:51,597
I've always helped you out with
your bills. I want to keep doing it.

750
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:54,589
I like to do it. Heaven knows, you
could never manage them alone.

751
00:50:54,856 --> 00:50:57,485
No. I will not listen to a word of this.

752
00:50:58,161 --> 00:50:59,785
Not here.
- Where then?

753
00:51:00,217 --> 00:51:02,714
And not without Flora.
- Now look, Lisa.

754
00:51:02,987 --> 00:51:03,772
I know.

755
00:51:04,724 --> 00:51:06,971
You bring Flora to
supper tomorrow night.

756
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,934
At first, you come to hear
me sing. For the last time.

757
00:51:10,136 --> 00:51:12,831
After, I send you a note.
- I don't know whether Flora would ..

758
00:51:13,093 --> 00:51:14,840
Flora? Flora is a modern woman.

759
00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:18,220
Of course she will come, rather than
let you come by yourself. You ask her.

760
00:51:18,507 --> 00:51:19,229
Well.

761
00:51:19,329 --> 00:51:21,267
Alright then. Tomorrow night.

762
00:51:21,766 --> 00:51:22,582
Goodbye.

763
00:51:29,643 --> 00:51:31,146
I wish I'd read the libretto.

764
00:51:31,772 --> 00:51:32,844
What is she singing?

765
00:51:33,432 --> 00:51:34,470
She's praying.

766
00:51:36,322 --> 00:51:37,988
For her husband to come back?

767
00:51:39,745 --> 00:51:41,288
Oh, I mean in the acting.

768
00:51:48,912 --> 00:51:50,161
Look here, Flora.

769
00:51:50,729 --> 00:51:52,959
It is alright to go to Lisa's
for supper tonight, isn't it?

770
00:51:53,059 --> 00:51:54,937
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

771
00:51:55,322 --> 00:51:57,568
No. I mean, there won't
be any unpleasantness?

772
00:51:58,281 --> 00:51:59,558
Not on my part.

773
00:55:50,330 --> 00:55:53,675
Naturally, I asked you.
You belong to the family now.

774
00:55:54,029 --> 00:55:57,194
I do not know yet just what relation
we are to be to one another.

775
00:55:57,416 --> 00:56:00,665
But something, surely.
My English is so shaky.

776
00:56:01,396 --> 00:56:02,887
"Wives-in-law", is it not?

777
00:56:03,662 --> 00:56:05,025
I couldn't say.

778
00:56:06,471 --> 00:56:07,510
What an idea.

779
00:56:07,765 --> 00:56:09,705
At any rate, we should not be strangers.

780
00:56:09,982 --> 00:56:11,451
We have so much in common now.

781
00:56:11,897 --> 00:56:14,258
Oh, my doctor.
- Señora.

782
00:56:14,768 --> 00:56:17,426
My Bice .. my Archimedes.

783
00:56:17,889 --> 00:56:19,813
Of course, you are
acquainted with the children.

784
00:56:19,913 --> 00:56:21,267
Yes, today it all happened.

785
00:56:21,367 --> 00:56:22,697
Good evening.
- Hello dear.

786
00:56:22,948 --> 00:56:24,037
She's so sweet.

787
00:56:25,362 --> 00:56:27,445
May I congratulate you on
your success this evening.

788
00:56:27,810 --> 00:56:30,217
Or would it only bore you?
You've had so many.

789
00:56:30,943 --> 00:56:34,739
One is rarely bored with the success
for which one has worked and planned.

790
00:56:35,538 --> 00:56:37,909
Don't you find that is
true, Mrs Preston?

791
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:41,367
Well, aren't you going to
say hello to me, Lisa?

792
00:56:42,814 --> 00:56:44,616
Standing there so big and solemn ..

793
00:56:44,824 --> 00:56:48,503
I quite forgot that you're no longer
part of the furniture of my life.

794
00:56:49,014 --> 00:56:51,404
Good evening, Gerald.
I am glad you are here.

795
00:56:51,650 --> 00:56:53,589
You're looking radiant.
- Thank you Gerald.

796
00:56:55,190 --> 00:56:58,436
Bice. Bicenza. Bicenza.

797
00:56:59,286 --> 00:57:00,187
Si Señora?

798
00:57:00,504 --> 00:57:03,197
Call the Dottore.
Call Archimedes. Quick.

799
00:57:03,556 --> 00:57:06,355
Tell them to move the table
right in there. But quickly.

800
00:57:06,668 --> 00:57:08,997
Si Señora .. Archimedes.

801
00:57:09,372 --> 00:57:10,874
Why are they doing that?

802
00:57:11,537 --> 00:57:13,672
It's easier than moving
the piano in there.

803
00:57:14,276 --> 00:57:16,628
They never do anything very
far away from the piano.

804
00:57:17,734 --> 00:57:18,677
How amazing.

805
00:57:19,011 --> 00:57:20,556
They're really a lot of fun.

806
00:57:22,017 --> 00:57:23,700
Well, here we are.

807
00:57:27,008 --> 00:57:29,131
Ah, just look at those truffles Flora.

808
00:57:29,375 --> 00:57:31,978
Those truffles have come
from my farm in Tuscany.

809
00:57:32,288 --> 00:57:34,914
Rigoletto and I hunted
for them last June.

810
00:57:35,247 --> 00:57:37,588
He with his nose, and I with my stick.

811
00:57:37,881 --> 00:57:40,149
To hit him on the head
when he find the truffle.

812
00:57:40,394 --> 00:57:42,325
He love a truffle, that Rigoletto.

813
00:57:42,611 --> 00:57:44,541
Archimedes, who is Rigoletto? Your son?

814
00:57:44,746 --> 00:57:46,226
No. My pig Madame.

815
00:57:48,123 --> 00:57:51,036
A great hunter of truffles is Rigoletto.

816
00:57:51,558 --> 00:57:53,541
What a strange name for a pig.

817
00:57:53,768 --> 00:57:57,180
Why not Madame?
He enjoys it poor fellow.

818
00:57:57,447 --> 00:58:00,099
It gives him some style
before the other pigs.

819
00:58:00,813 --> 00:58:02,602
My cow, I name Aida.

820
00:58:03,052 --> 00:58:06,543
My ox, Don Giovanni.
Oh, they are all very pleased.

821
00:58:07,717 --> 00:58:10,832
Yes, Archimedes is going to retire to
his farm when he gets old, and ..

822
00:58:11,044 --> 00:58:13,010
The doctor here, to a
little practice in Cannes.

823
00:58:13,110 --> 00:58:13,946
Oh yes.

824
00:58:14,503 --> 00:58:16,699
Two years ago, I tried to leave Madame.

825
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:20,181
I had the rheumatism and
a little homesickness.

826
00:58:20,796 --> 00:58:24,980
So my sister, she say: "why you run all
around the whole world with rheumatism?"

827
00:58:25,223 --> 00:58:26,642
"Stay here, and I cook for you."

828
00:58:26,987 --> 00:58:28,389
So I tried to stay.

829
00:58:29,610 --> 00:58:31,106
Why didn't you?
- Well.

830
00:58:31,327 --> 00:58:32,191
I tell you.

831
00:58:32,511 --> 00:58:36,644
An opera company come to Cannes
and they give La Forte Del Simio.

832
00:58:37,019 --> 00:58:39,531
I go .. the Soprano,
she sings like a cow.

833
00:58:39,825 --> 00:58:41,298
I think she might never ..

[ Italian language ]

835
00:58:46,807 --> 00:58:47,804
And I run out.

836
00:58:50,486 --> 00:58:52,466
Tell me doctor, where did
you run? Back to Madame?

837
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:54,638
Yes .. and here I am.

838
00:58:56,725 --> 00:58:59,446
The music is in the blood,
worse than the rheumatism.

839
00:58:59,861 --> 00:59:01,147
It makes me suffer more.

840
00:59:01,682 --> 00:59:02,800
And the memories.

841
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:05,237
Grab my heart a hundred times a day.

842
00:59:05,530 --> 00:59:08,663
And pictures of the past come
up quickly to my mind at night.

843
00:59:09,126 --> 00:59:10,121
And I am alone.

844
00:59:11,569 --> 00:59:14,771
Ah, it is a great life of pictures
we live with Madame.

845
00:59:15,935 --> 00:59:16,664
Imagine.

846
00:59:18,868 --> 00:59:20,267
All about the laundry?

847
00:59:20,876 --> 00:59:23,589
Oh of course, she does not
compare with Madame.

848
00:59:23,867 --> 00:59:25,360
She's a very good dramatic.

[ Italian language ]

850
00:59:38,374 --> 00:59:40,534
As a matter of fact, I've
heard there are lots of things.

851
00:59:43,497 --> 00:59:44,705
Hear Señor Geraldo.

852
00:59:44,930 --> 00:59:47,119
He say so too and he is a connoisseur.

853
00:59:47,569 --> 00:59:50,687
In the Aria with the tenor.
Oh, what a beauty.

854
00:59:50,988 --> 00:59:51,851
Ah poo!

855
00:59:53,185 --> 00:59:54,973
I will play it for you.
- I'll get my flute.

856
00:59:55,084 --> 00:59:56,787
Yes, Archimedes, get your flute.

857
01:00:40,672 --> 01:00:41,714
What I say?

858
01:00:42,663 --> 01:00:46,466
So sentimental and sickly it
makes your stocking's fall down.

859
01:00:46,935 --> 01:00:47,642
Bice.

860
01:00:50,685 --> 01:00:51,793
Oh, Mama-mia.

861
01:00:53,445 --> 01:00:55,661
Oh .. Bice. Pass the salad.

862
01:00:56,064 --> 01:00:58,636
Have some salad, Flora?
- No thanks. Not anymore.

863
01:00:59,135 --> 01:01:02,308
Well, Señor Geraldo, this is
the last of our suppers together.

864
01:01:02,653 --> 01:01:03,854
Your health, Doctor.

865
01:01:09,067 --> 01:01:11,543
We have drink the health

01:01:14,713 --> 01:01:16,466
Yes, it was fun while it lasted.

Madame Della Robbia.
I hear you're to be married again.

869

What?

870
01:01:22,272 --> 01:01:23,287
What's this, Lisa?

871
01:01:24,116 --> 01:01:25,333
You never told me.

872
01:01:25,845 --> 01:01:28,800
Now that Gerald has gone, I think you
ought to talk these things over with me.

873
01:01:29,011 --> 01:01:31,115
Hey, look here.
Don't talk as though I were dead.

874
01:01:32,084 --> 01:01:33,864

01:11:55,664 --> 01:11:58,055
You called his club all night long,
and he hasn't been in yet?

1054
01:12:01,407 --> 01:12:02,558
Are you sure?

1055
01:12:10,841 --> 01:12:11,513
Hello.

1056
01:12:12,127 --> 01:12:14,052
Get me a taxi .. right away.

1057
01:12:18,137 --> 01:12:19,611
Good morning, good morning.

1058
01:12:19,874 --> 01:12:21,151
Buongiorno, Geraldo.

1059
01:12:21,414 --> 01:12:23,020
Very happy to see you again.

1060
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:25,246
Thank you, Bice.
Good morning, Archimedes.

1061
01:12:25,536 --> 01:12:27,049
Very happy. Very happy.

1062
01:12:31,525 --> 01:12:33,928
Buongiorno, Bice.
- Buongiorno, Señora.

1063
01:12:43,476 --> 01:12:45,044
My dear, have you gone musical?

1064
01:12:45,326 --> 01:12:48,114
Why not, darling. You look lovely enough
to drag the heart out of a catfish.

1065
01:12:48,349 --> 01:12:49,964
Good morning, Toto. Come, come, come.

1066
01:12:51,344 --> 01:12:54,101
Well Bice, how would you like
settling down in America, huh?

1067
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:57,815
What is?
- Yes, Bice. No more opera.

1068
01:12:58,510 --> 01:13:01,458
From today, we raise chickens,
the most beautiful chickens.

1069
01:13:01,673 --> 01:13:04,350
Yes, you remember Bice? I showed you
pictures of my house in the country.

1070
01:13:05,296 --> 01:13:06,658
We don't go to South America?

1071
01:13:06,966 --> 01:13:07,867
Of course not.

1072
01:13:08,137 --> 01:13:09,781
Certainly not. Never heard of the place.

1073
01:13:12,853 --> 01:13:13,589
I love.

1074
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:18,724
Oh you darling, you darling. Promise
me that you'll never leave me again.

1075
01:13:18,824 --> 01:13:20,823
Promise me that or you
won't get any breakfast.

1076
01:13:22,828 --> 01:13:25,584
Henceforward, I will be like
a shadow cast by the sun.

1077
01:13:26,095 --> 01:13:27,867
Now to the East, now to the West.

1078
01:13:28,655 --> 01:13:30,488
But always close beside you.

1079
01:13:33,484 --> 01:13:34,556
Eat your grapefruit.

1080
01:13:35,807 --> 01:13:38,225
Of course, I won't mind if you sing
a performance now and again ..

1081
01:13:38,325 --> 01:13:39,397
At the metropolitan.

1082
01:13:40,726 --> 01:13:41,895
Oh, you darling.

1083
01:13:43,008 --> 01:13:44,109
And at Covent Garden.

1084
01:13:45,086 --> 01:13:46,518
Just once in a while.

1085
01:13:46,873 --> 01:13:48,891
Well, alright.
Just once in a great while.

1086
01:13:49,296 --> 01:13:50,415
Oh Toto!

1087
01:13:50,873 --> 01:13:51,925
Toto darling.

1088
01:13:53,562 --> 01:13:54,936
Toto will finally bark.

1089
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:56,678
Yes, but ..

1090
01:13:57,542 --> 01:13:59,179
Is there something else, my Gerald?

1091
01:14:00,351 --> 01:14:01,530
Just .. Toto.

1092
01:14:02,431 --> 01:14:05,825
Oh .. never again will I ask
you to take care of Toto.

1093
01:14:06,539 --> 01:14:07,268
I swear.

1094
01:14:09,152 --> 01:14:11,154
Will you forgive your mother, darling?

1095
01:14:18,175 --> 01:14:20,262
What are you trying to do?
- Madame is not up yet.

1096
01:14:20,362 --> 01:14:22,625
It doesn't matter. That will do.
- But you cannot come in.

1097
01:14:22,725 --> 01:14:24,513
I'd like to know who's
going to keep me out.

1098
01:14:31,791 --> 01:14:33,398
Good .. good morning, Flora.

1099
01:14:33,676 --> 01:14:35,643
I simply wanted to make sure.

1100
01:14:39,109 --> 01:14:40,987
You didn't answer the
telephone last night.

1101
01:14:41,798 --> 01:14:43,803
Oh, I answered it three or four times.

1102
01:14:44,524 --> 01:14:46,559
You know what I mean perfectly well.

1103
01:14:47,129 --> 01:14:48,728
I called you for hours.

1104
01:14:49,358 --> 01:14:51,581
Finally, the operator said
the receiver was off.

1105
01:14:53,353 --> 01:14:55,654
It must have fallen off.
- Do you take me for a fool?

1106
01:14:56,661 --> 01:14:57,590
If you think ..

1107
01:14:57,870 --> 01:15:00,265
If you think I'll let myself
be humiliated like this ..

1108
01:15:00,365 --> 01:15:02,105
For a common opera singer.

1109
01:15:02,586 --> 01:15:03,172
Oh.

1110
01:15:03,378 --> 01:15:04,467
Now, Mrs Preston.

1111
01:15:04,692 --> 01:15:06,336
Don't imagine you've broken my heart.

1112
01:15:06,734 --> 01:15:08,092
I happen to be rather hard up.

1113
01:15:08,439 --> 01:15:09,918
And I need a solvent husband.

1114
01:15:10,407 --> 01:15:12,910
What do you suppose this woman wants
of you? Except to pay her debts?

1115
01:15:13,012 --> 01:15:15,715
And cover up her affairs with
Dukes and Princes and whatnot.

1116
01:15:15,815 --> 01:15:17,653
Will you please confine
your remarks to me.

1117
01:15:17,753 --> 01:15:19,319
I'll confine them to my lawyer.

1118
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:21,668
You. .. you libertine!

1119
01:15:22,930 --> 01:15:26,084
You'll make a good settlement,
or I'll know the reason why.

1120
01:15:26,731 --> 01:15:27,832
Good day to you both.

1121
01:15:33,758 --> 01:15:34,687
What a woman.

1122
01:15:34,990 --> 01:15:36,101
How dare she?

1123
01:15:37,317 --> 01:15:39,818
How dare she come into
my own house and talk so.

1124
01:15:40,291 --> 01:15:43,895
It isn't as if she is the wife. I should
have said to her "are you the wife?".

1125
01:15:44,209 --> 01:15:47,326
Darling, darling .. you forget.
We are practically divorced, you and I.

1126
01:15:47,851 --> 01:15:50,094
Oh yes. And whose fault is it? Hers.

1127
01:15:50,447 --> 01:15:53,029
Oh, I should have said to her ..
- Hey, wait a minute.

1128
01:15:53,263 --> 01:15:55,938
It's alright. I'll pay her off.
We don't want any more trouble.

1129
01:15:56,509 --> 01:15:59,107
Opera singers are just like
actors, only more so.

1130
01:16:01,262 --> 01:16:03,193
Oh, I beg your pardon
but isn't this Mrs Preston?

1131
01:16:03,297 --> 01:16:04,556
Yes.
- Fine.

1132
01:16:05,047 --> 01:16:07,066
We're just going to interview
Madame Della Robbia.

1133
01:16:07,166 --> 01:16:09,109
You have called on her,
haven't you, Mrs Preston?

1134
01:16:09,209 --> 01:16:10,453
Will you excuse me please.

1135
01:16:11,860 --> 01:16:12,806
Just a minute.

1136
01:16:13,197 --> 01:16:14,613
When is the wedding going to be?

1137
01:16:14,910 --> 01:16:16,443
There isn't going to be any wedding.

1138
01:16:16,697 --> 01:16:17,376
Oh.

1139
01:16:17,704 --> 01:16:20,056
How do you do Mrs Preston.
Do you know where Gerald is?

1140
01:16:20,306 --> 01:16:21,876
Nothing could interest me less.

1141
01:16:24,339 --> 01:16:25,726
Well, what do you make of that?

1142
01:16:27,590 --> 01:16:28,820
Hey, I smell a mouse.

1143
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:30,586
You go phone our city desk, Trixie.

1144
01:16:30,812 --> 01:16:32,142
Joe and I are going upstairs.

1145
01:16:36,008 --> 01:16:36,651
Lisa.

1146
01:16:37,062 --> 01:16:37,705
Lisa.

1147
01:16:38,879 --> 01:16:40,581
Hey, hey. Get rid of him.
Get rid of him.

1148
01:16:41,447 --> 01:16:42,948
He mustn't see me in these clothes.

1149
01:16:46,502 --> 01:16:48,280
Johnny and Aline.
- Hello, Lisa.

1150
01:16:48,814 --> 01:16:49,486
Hello.

1151
01:16:51,111 --> 01:16:52,912
Having breakfast? Gerald here already?

1152
01:16:53,303 --> 01:16:54,148
Oh .. no ..

1153
01:16:54,823 --> 01:16:55,950
Yes. He's not here.

1154
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:56,923
What?

1155
01:16:59,885 --> 01:17:01,820
I thought I might help
you pack or something.

1156
01:17:02,390 --> 01:17:04,583
Say, we saw Mrs Preston
downstairs, talking with some men.

1157
01:17:04,868 --> 01:17:06,318
Reporters, I think.
- Who?

1158
01:17:06,573 --> 01:17:07,931
Yes. One of them had a camera.

1159
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:08,906
So.

1160
01:17:09,334 --> 01:17:11,093
May I go in your bedroom
to powder my nose?

1161
01:17:11,204 --> 01:17:12,743
Oh .. you mean .. in the ..

1162
01:17:13,066 --> 01:17:13,995
In the bedroom.

1163
01:17:14,110 --> 01:17:14,782
May I?

1164
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:17,790
No, my dear. Wait. Wait my dear.

1165
01:17:18,706 --> 01:17:19,727
[ Telephone ]

1166
01:17:19,945 --> 01:17:20,674
You see?

1167
01:17:22,077 --> 01:17:23,654
I will answer. I had better answer.

1168
01:17:29,204 --> 01:17:30,760
Hello?
- What are you doing?

1169
01:17:32,194 --> 01:17:33,298
Why don't you answer?

1170
01:17:33,569 --> 01:17:35,800
They can't hear you Lisa.
The phone isn't plugged in.

1171
01:17:36,054 --> 01:17:37,731
Oh Bice, plug in the plug.

1172
01:17:37,943 --> 01:17:40,474
I always like to telephone down here.
I can hear better by the window.

1173
01:17:40,647 --> 01:17:43,197
Hello, yes it's me .. who you want?

1174
01:17:44,236 --> 01:17:46,020
No, I cannot receive at this hour.

1175
01:17:47,124 --> 01:17:47,943
Bice ..

1176
01:17:49,302 --> 01:17:51,037
Everybody is telephoning all the time.

1177
01:17:52,238 --> 01:17:53,053
The papers?

1178
01:17:53,402 --> 01:17:53,988
No.

1179
01:17:54,686 --> 01:17:55,272
No.

1180
01:17:55,685 --> 01:17:56,308
No.

1181
01:18:00,337 --> 01:18:02,029
Is this Madame Della Robbia's apartment?

1182
01:18:02,621 --> 01:18:03,244
No.

1183
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:08,310
Gerald.

1184
01:18:12,028 --> 01:18:13,455
Gerald, what are you doing here?

1185
01:18:13,627 --> 01:18:15,625
I can't get out. I mean I just came in.

1186
01:18:16,203 --> 01:18:17,828
Don't let them in. They're reporters.

1187
01:18:18,050 --> 01:18:19,597
How dare you pound on my door!

1188
01:18:20,938 --> 01:18:23,069
Gerald, what are you doing
here in your evening clothes?

1189
01:18:23,590 --> 01:18:25,606
I wear them all the time now.
They're more becoming.

1190
01:18:25,745 --> 01:18:27,540
Meaning what?
- Mind your own business.

1191
01:18:28,244 --> 01:18:29,482
No, don't answer it Lisa.

1192
01:18:29,582 --> 01:18:31,415
I had better go.
They phone all the time.

1193
01:18:31,576 --> 01:18:33,911
I plug in the plug.
- Never mind Bice. Don't answer it.

1194
01:18:34,211 --> 01:18:36,427
But why are they telephoning,
and why are they knocking?

1195
01:18:37,223 --> 01:18:39,575
And why are you in evening clothes
at this hour of the morning?

1196
01:18:40,109 --> 01:18:40,995
Well, I ..

1197
01:18:43,420 --> 01:18:44,029
Oh.

1198
01:18:45,658 --> 01:18:46,326
Oh!

1199
01:18:47,408 --> 01:18:48,166
Oh .. oh.

1200
01:18:48,659 --> 01:18:50,597
Oh? Keep still.
Keep still and let me think.

1201
01:18:50,762 --> 01:18:51,708
Oh, gracious.

1202
01:18:52,001 --> 01:18:53,738
Bice, Bice .. oh shut up.

1203
01:18:55,095 --> 01:18:57,469
Tell Archimedes to answer the door
and make those men go away.

1204
01:18:57,971 --> 01:18:59,848
Lisa, you had better
go in the dining room.

1205
01:19:00,043 --> 01:19:00,764
Oh.

1206
01:19:01,801 --> 01:19:04,432
You idiot! Stop saying "Oh"
and make yourself useful.

1207
01:19:04,599 --> 01:19:05,210
Oh!

1208
01:19:05,425 --> 01:19:07,089
Take care of Aline. Hide her somewhere.

1209
01:19:07,189 --> 01:19:08,691
Where?
- Anywhere. I don't care.

1210
01:19:08,894 --> 01:19:10,533
Oh, this is a nice piece of work.

1211
01:19:11,276 --> 01:19:11,952
Oh.

1212
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:13,146
Oh.

1213
01:19:13,507 --> 01:19:14,236
Shut up!

1214
01:19:14,472 --> 01:19:16,460
Hey what is this? Hey. Open up.
- Come on, open up.

1215
01:19:20,810 --> 01:19:22,807
Nobody is in this flat.

1216
01:19:23,583 --> 01:19:24,356
Vacant!

1217
01:19:25,248 --> 01:19:26,612
Hey, what is this, anyway?

1218
01:19:26,855 --> 01:19:28,254
Now, you get out of here.

1219
01:19:29,378 --> 01:19:31,704
To meet hat mob in these clothes?
- You have no business here.

1220
01:19:32,118 --> 01:19:34,445
She's my sister and I ..
- Johnny, they're married.

1221
01:19:34,865 --> 01:19:37,433
Oh, are they? What about
that interlocutory decree?

1222
01:19:37,691 --> 01:19:40,054
Oh yes. I have forgot. We both forgot.

1223
01:19:40,928 --> 01:19:42,482
Well, those reporters won't forget.

1224
01:19:42,939 --> 01:19:44,469
Yeah, that's right. Well, move over.

1225
01:19:44,591 --> 01:19:46,431
Help, help! Help.

1226
01:19:46,919 --> 01:19:47,562
Help!

1227
01:19:47,790 --> 01:19:48,721
What is it now?

1228
01:19:48,893 --> 01:19:50,725
The dumb-waiter.
- The dumb-waiter?

1229
01:19:51,123 --> 01:19:52,954
Someone hide in the dumb-waiter.

1230
01:19:53,211 --> 01:19:54,397
I hold. Come quick.

1231
01:19:54,578 --> 01:19:55,809
What is going on?

1232
01:19:56,531 --> 01:19:59,445
I see the top of his head.
I pull the rope. Down he go.

1233
01:20:00,173 --> 01:20:01,646
Come on Archimedes, we'll fix him.

1234
01:20:02,330 --> 01:20:03,431
He has come up again.

1235
01:20:03,659 --> 01:20:04,943
Get you down, or I pour.

1236
01:20:05,206 --> 01:20:06,242
Get you down.

1237
01:20:06,550 --> 01:20:08,144
Keep your shirt on, Bice.

1238
01:20:08,625 --> 01:20:09,354
It's me.

1239
01:20:09,594 --> 01:20:10,562
Señor Farnham.

1240
01:20:10,803 --> 01:20:12,042
And I almost poured.

1241
01:20:13,286 --> 01:20:14,803
Well, well.
- Farnham.

1242
01:20:16,922 --> 01:20:19,455
Is this that peace-and-quiet
you were talking about?

1243
01:20:19,686 --> 01:20:21,783
Oh, Flora turned the
whole press loose on us.

1244
01:20:22,014 --> 01:20:24,469
You're telling me. The lobby
is knee-deep with them.

1245
01:20:24,890 --> 01:20:26,260
Farnham .. go out.

1246
01:20:26,544 --> 01:20:27,504
Send them away.

1247
01:20:27,604 --> 01:20:30,009
So that you can go to that
potato-patch, or whatever it is?

1248
01:20:30,322 --> 01:20:31,643
Oh Farnham, as my friend ..

1249
01:20:31,743 --> 01:20:32,523
Please.

1250
01:20:32,799 --> 01:20:35,269
Nobody on earth can do that.
- Well, what can we do then?

1251
01:20:35,479 --> 01:20:37,304
How about running away?
- In that thing?

1252
01:20:37,559 --> 01:20:38,821
I can't recommend it.

1253
01:20:39,817 --> 01:20:41,147
We'll elope to South America.

1254
01:20:41,247 --> 01:20:43,393
Farnham, go outside and
stall the reporters. Get going.

1255
01:20:43,527 --> 01:20:44,455
Okay, Gerald.

1256
01:20:44,555 --> 01:20:45,971
Bice, you get a coat for Madame.

1257
01:20:46,176 --> 01:20:47,118
Hurry. Come on.

1258
01:20:47,218 --> 01:20:49,950
Archimedes, you get the doctor and take
our luggage to the boat. Now quickly.

1259
01:20:50,387 --> 01:20:51,946
You'll have to travel light for once.

1260
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:57,452
Wait a minute.

1261
01:20:58,053 --> 01:21:00,920
Now if you boys will just be patient
for five about five minutes ..

1262
01:21:01,020 --> 01:21:02,627
I'll give you a real good story.

1263
01:21:05,503 --> 01:21:06,254
Quiet!

1264
01:21:07,343 --> 01:21:08,215
Five minutes.

1265
01:21:09,772 --> 01:21:11,379
Hey, we won't need that.

1266
01:21:11,604 --> 01:21:12,562
Move over, Lisa.

1267
01:21:13,279 --> 01:21:14,428
Now, down we go.

1268
01:21:14,608 --> 01:21:15,960
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1269
01:21:16,305 --> 01:21:18,145
Don't forget Toto.
- 0h yes.

1270
01:21:18,513 --> 01:21:19,658
Here Gerald.
- What?

1271
01:21:19,902 --> 01:21:20,634
Goodbye.

1272
01:21:21,081 --> 01:21:22,183
Now see here, Lisa.

1273
01:21:22,671 --> 01:21:25,409
I'm letting you sing again, and I'm
even going to South America with you.

1274
01:21:26,020 --> 01:21:27,778
But there's one thing
I'll never do again.

1275
01:21:28,416 --> 01:21:29,820
Be nursemaid to that dog.

1276
01:21:31,945 --> 01:21:32,850
Gee-whizz.

1277
01:21:34,307 --> 01:21:37,304
Gerald. Never, you have
spoken to me like this before.

1278
01:21:38,039 --> 01:21:38,978
I like it.

1279
01:21:39,616 --> 01:21:40,247
Huh?

1280
01:21:51,475 --> 01:21:52,541
Exit, Madame.

1281
01:22:25,203 --> 01:22:26,442
-(s-d)-
