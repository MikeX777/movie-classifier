1
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:26,700
During the winter time of 8th grade

2
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,829
I suddenly fell ill after receiving high school

3
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:33,539
Had to be in bed for more than a week due to high fever,

4
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,299
And when I realized ...

5
00:01:40,299 --> 00:01:43,969
... I can no longer hear the sound of a clock or a vehicle.

6
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,350
The morning was so quiet.

7
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:50,100
I still remember that feeling of loneliness.

8
00:01:54,819 --> 00:01:59,069
Until I heard the warm and soft sounds of the sunlit place.

9
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:11,370
<b> Hidamari ga Kikoeru (Silhouette of Your Voice) <i> Based on Yuki Fumino's manga </ i> </ b></b></i>

10
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:57,669
Eh?

11
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,670
Cost per hour is Â¥ 1500! <i> </i>

12
00:02:59,669 --> 00:03:01,379
It was not bad

13
00:03:01,969 --> 00:03:03,430
Well, if for tutors, the price is too normal

14
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,760
Actually, this is pretty low compared to his job

15
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,759
And also, Taiichi

16
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:09,310
People like you want to be a tutor?

17
00:03:09,849 --> 00:03:12,810
If this does not go well ... I'll be in trouble.

18
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:14,849
From today, I will not even be able to buy food

19
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:16,479
What's wrong with your workplace?

20
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:17,899
I think you've got to eat in the restaurant.

21
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,819
I have my own problem that I can not say!

22
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:21,069
Your voice is noisy!

23
00:03:21,069 --> 00:03:21,859
Do not say like that.

24
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,200
That's why I say reduce your voice.

25
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,949
In that case, would you treat me to a meal?

26
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:30,289
We're scissors, rocks, paper .... Yeah !!

27
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:35,789
Series?

28
00:03:35,789 --> 00:03:40,419
It's the first time I've heard anyone get fired because of the noise.

29
00:03:40,419 --> 00:03:42,419
Emangnya your voice that hard huh? : v

30
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:45,509
Did not you say I was noisy?

31
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:47,299
It turned out to be hard ...

32
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,260
Sorry Sorry...

33
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:55,060
I do not matter because I'm a regular ..

34
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:59,900
The manager initially praised for my excited voice, but eventually told me to leave.

35
00:04:00,939 --> 00:04:01,900
You're that ...

36
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:05,989
Are you not being polite to customers?

37
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,120
Yes ... So ...

38
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,909
You should just leave it alone.

39
00:04:12,909 --> 00:04:15,039
It's because of your useless sense of justice.

40
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:16,329
Not like that.

41
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,088
A ... I'm hungry ...

42
00:04:22,088 --> 00:04:22,959
I also.

43
00:04:23,379 --> 00:04:24,589
I'm going to the cafeteria.

44
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:28,550
Do you want to go there by yourself and leave me starving?

45
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:29,840
Then why do not you come too?

46
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:32,469
I told you I do not have any money.

47
00:04:33,269 --> 00:04:35,349
Oh so .. Bye.

48
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:40,479
Lu base does not have feelings !!

49
00:04:43,069 --> 00:04:43,689
Sorry..

50
00:04:48,779 --> 00:04:50,699
Money this time can eat what try?

51
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,579
A .. Hungry ...

52
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:05,460
<i> I plan to work after high school </ i></i>

53
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:09,589
But the teacher advised me to enroll in the university,

54
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,139
and here I am.

55
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,850
I'm starving ...

56
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,689
Can not hold ...

57
00:05:26,779 --> 00:05:28,699
Lapaaarrr .....

58
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,660
Sick..

59
00:05:39,459 --> 00:05:41,579
Oh, sorry it shocked you.

60
00:05:45,129 --> 00:05:48,050
<i> What are you doing sitting there? </ i></i>

61
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:51,629
Oh !! It looks good!

62
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,150
What? May I eat?

63
00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:11,279
Serious? You're really good .. ^^ o ^^

64
00:06:12,529 --> 00:06:14,989
The person who wants to offer the food is a great individual.

65
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:16,160
Enjoy your meal.

66
00:06:19,329 --> 00:06:20,000
Enaakk!

67
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,549
Wait .. This ...

68
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,180
What is wrong with her?

69
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:39,099
That .. Sugihara, right?

70
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:39,970
Sugihara?

71
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:42,850
Sugihara Kouhei. He is also still the first year.

72
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:45,730
How do you know?

73
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,150
He's pretty famous.

74
00:06:47,149 --> 00:06:49,529
You're busy working part-time so you do not know, but,

75
00:06:49,529 --> 00:06:51,529
He is quite striking and popular among women.

76
00:06:56,069 --> 00:06:57,329
Ah, and also,

77
00:06:57,829 --> 00:06:58,659
This,

78
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,870
<i> Wanted Note Taker? </ i></i>

79
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:06,579
It is for students who have problems understanding the lessons because of hearing loss,

80
00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:11,129
So other students can make notes about lessons for them.

81
00:07:11,709 --> 00:07:13,549
Can not he hear anything?

82
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:15,050
I'm not sure.

83
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:17,759
Oh, look.

84
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,639
Uwah, they seem to use sign language.

85
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:28,019
Yes it seems right.

86
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:30,279
He may indeed have a hearing problem?

87
00:07:31,069 --> 00:07:34,610
By the way, why are you looking for Sugihara?

88
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:36,410
I want to return something.

89
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:37,280
Restore?

90
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,000
I go first.

91
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:46,250
Tu - Wait for Taiichi.

92
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:46,790
What?

93
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,500
Do not deal with it.

94
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,170
Ha?

95
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:51,460
I told you. He is not close to other people.

96
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:53,049
I've never heard anything good about her.

97
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:56,509
He does not even look like a senpai.

98
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:58,469
You do not want to be bothered right?

99
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:00,470
Wait.

100
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:01,640
Uh, well, come on.

101
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,780
Ouch!

102
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,280
Hello.

103
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:22,870
I think I can see you here,

104
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,750
You're right here.

105
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,370
Oh yes.

106
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,500
Here.

107
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:31,500
I want to return this.

108
00:08:35,129 --> 00:08:36,470
I've cleaned it up.

109
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,009
Bentonya is very good.

110
00:08:42,928 --> 00:08:45,679
At that time I almost died of hunger,

111
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:46,769
but luckily you saved me.

112
00:08:48,019 --> 00:08:50,899
Oh yeah, I heard you have a bad reputation,

113
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:52,980
but such a person will not offer me food, right?

114
00:08:54,529 --> 00:08:57,360
So to return the favor,

115
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,909
It .. Let me do it.

116
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:05,199
Instead, make me a bento.

117
00:09:05,789 --> 00:09:08,459
Why can I hear you clearly?

118
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,920
Oh yes I forgot. I will write.

119
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:16,669
If you talk slowly, I can still understand.

120
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:20,470
What? You can talk anyway.

121
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:22,930
I thought you could not make a sound.

122
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:24,389
Thank God..

123
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:26,389
I got confused how to communicate with you.

124
00:09:27,889 --> 00:09:31,309
You can hear my voice, right?

125
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:33,480
Ano ..

126
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,320
First do you want to tell your name?

127
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,860
Sagawa Taiichi.

128
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,450
Taiichi, tumben you go to class,

129
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:28,490
Still not working yet?

130
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:30,789
I'm working again now.

131
00:10:30,789 --> 00:10:32,620
Work? What?

132
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:34,620
Note taker.

133
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:39,129
Do not you, Sugihara?

134
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:40,379
Yes.

135
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:41,840
Is not this a volunteer job?

136
00:10:42,379 --> 00:10:44,929
Actually, I just want to do it temporarily,

137
00:10:44,929 --> 00:10:47,719
But he wants me to do it for a long time.

138
00:10:48,309 --> 00:10:49,809
And the rewards ...

139
00:10:49,809 --> 00:10:52,939
One bento box for one note.

140
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:58,569
Where else can I get a dream job like this?

141
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:02,150
Luck was finally on my side.

142
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:05,030
Are you okay?

143
00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:07,909
Just writing notes, right? No problem!

144
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:14,040
... the first visionary concept was coined by a British sociologist named John Erly.

145
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:30,070
... a visionary consumption that leads to a change of lifestyle .. People are starting to miss the rural nature ...

146
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,659
Uenakk!

147
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:38,250
Sagawa-kun ..

148
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,710
Hmm?

149
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:41,590
Something you forgot to write here.

150
00:12:43,049 --> 00:12:44,959
Oh, that..

151
00:12:45,169 --> 00:12:46,969
Sorry I overslept.

152
00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:49,970
I will not sleep again next time.

153
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,600
Sorry, I promise.

154
00:13:06,029 --> 00:13:10,490
It's hard to write everything the professor says in class.

155
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:14,909
It usually takes two trained people to do it in turn.

156
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:18,039
But since I can only hear half of it,

157
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:20,829
your job just write down the important parts only.

158
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:23,129
Uh, what's up?

159
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:28,379
Are they your acquaintances?

160
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:31,929
They are from the sign language club.

161
00:13:31,929 --> 00:13:34,059
They invited me to join him many times.

162
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:38,060
Ah .. So that's why they use sign language.

163
00:13:38,059 --> 00:13:40,649
I've never seen anyone who used sign language before ...

164
00:13:41,059 --> 00:13:41,979
I also...

165
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:47,490
Even with the difficulty of hearing, the level of each person is different.

166
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,400
Many people out there who do not understand sign language.

167
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,779
Always think if people with hearing impairment can sign language it is quite annoying.

168
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,950
I do not need that.

169
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,540
<i> Let's eat. </ i></i>

170
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:01,169
This is not bad ... Quite useful too.

171
00:14:01,169 --> 00:14:04,589
After all, it's easier for me to read my lips.

172
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:06,710
Is not it even more difficult?

173
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:07,629
Not really..

174
00:14:07,629 --> 00:14:10,009
Everyone can do it through practice.

175
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:14,550
Yes, even if you do not need it.

176
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,850
Why?

177
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:18,470
Does not anyone ever say that you're talking too loud?

178
00:14:19,429 --> 00:14:21,769
Ah .. There are some ...

179
00:14:21,769 --> 00:14:24,309
... that complains if my voice is too noisy.

180
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:28,990
That's a bash thing.

181
00:14:29,899 --> 00:14:33,110
That means you can communicate effectively.

182
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,620
That's why I can easily talk with you.

183
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,289
I do not have to ask you to repeat your words.

184
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:46,040
Can you stop calling me Sagawa-kun?

185
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:46,789
Eh?

186
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,259
<i> Note: Sagawa Xpress </ i> Because that sounds like a shipping company.</i>

187
00:14:51,139 --> 00:14:53,179
Anyway, how ya ...

188
00:14:53,179 --> 00:14:54,139
What?

189
00:14:55,259 --> 00:14:57,559
Anyway, just call it by my first name.

190
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:58,849
I will do the same.

191
00:15:00,889 --> 00:15:02,059
OK.

192
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,370
Taiichi-san ...

193
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:21,830
What happened to you later?

194
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:27,000
You become diligent in class, and always pay attention to the lesson.

195
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,169
Yes, it's because I found a perfect part-time job.

196
00:15:30,169 --> 00:15:33,049
What's with Sugihara?

197
00:15:33,049 --> 00:15:33,419
Yes.

198
00:15:34,179 --> 00:15:36,299
Bentonya really good.

199
00:15:36,299 --> 00:15:40,599
Now my goal is to get lunch.

200
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,430
What is that?

201
00:15:41,929 --> 00:15:44,019
The Sugihara is not bothered?

202
00:15:44,019 --> 00:15:46,019
Ha? Not at all!

203
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:49,019
Precisely people make it a problem that is actually problematic.

204
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:50,860
Why are you so serious?

205
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,820
Sorry Sorry. Come on.

206
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:55,150
Why do you look disappointed?

207
00:16:00,299 --> 00:16:01,990
His voice is loud yes.

208
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:11,799
Hey, Taiichi!

209
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:15,340
Your netnet is everywhere.

210
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:18,590
You know! The class?

211
00:16:18,889 --> 00:16:20,220
Already ..

212
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,970
Drop ..

213
00:16:23,179 --> 00:16:24,679
Sorry!

214
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:25,809
This time...

215
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:29,399
... I overslept again.

216
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:31,569
Sorry.

217
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:35,610
Bentonya is left behind at home.

218
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:37,820
Eh .. You did not bring bento?

219
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,120
What...

220
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,370
.. no problem really.

221
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,910
Then, going to the cafeteria together?

222
00:16:44,909 --> 00:16:45,620
Eh?

223
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:49,879
Yes, you know, there's cheaper than outside.

224
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:53,049
Occasionally eat at different places.

225
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,629
Eh, do not want to?

226
00:16:56,629 --> 00:16:59,139
No, not that.

227
00:16:59,139 --> 00:17:00,720
- Then come on. - I'm not used to going there.

228
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,009
Tun--

229
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:02,970
What money do you bring?

230
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:04,970
Why should I tell you?

231
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:06,100
Never mind .. How much?

232
00:17:12,769 --> 00:17:14,358
Uwaa .. Keliatannya delicious.

233
00:17:14,358 --> 00:17:17,148
Which is it delicious? Everything looks good.

234
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:18,280
Is it true?

235
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:20,108
Obviously it's hard to decide.

236
00:17:20,108 --> 00:17:23,528
= Eh there is Sugihara. - Sugihara-kun!

237
00:17:23,529 --> 00:17:25,410
It's rare to see you here.

238
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:27,079
Do you want to have lunch?

239
00:17:27,078 --> 00:17:28,368
Let's eat together.

240
00:17:28,368 --> 00:17:29,750
Sugihara-kun is alone, right?

241
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,960
We have reserved a table there.

242
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,829
-Ayo..ayo ... - I ...

243
00:17:31,829 --> 00:17:34,710
Oh yeah, the club will have a meeting today, you want to come?

244
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:36,799
Right ... You'll be happy to join us.

245
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,339
Come yeah ... you wanna come right?

246
00:17:38,339 --> 00:17:42,259
Everyone will be happy if Sugihara want to join.

247
00:17:42,259 --> 00:17:42,759
Want to come?

248
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:46,099
You want to come? You come later, right?

249
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:48,679
Hey, hey, how about we join too?

250
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,810
People like you do not fit into our club.

251
00:17:50,809 --> 00:17:53,190
What? Sugihara-kun is also not a member of the club.

252
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,799
Sugihara is different from you guys ..

253
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:56,230
Would not it be fun if we all left? Sugihara is different from you guys ..

254
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:57,230
Would not it be fun if we all left?

255
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:57,860
Correct.

256
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,990
Sugihara-kun ..

257
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,319
We are ignored.

258
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:05,990
Kouhei!

259
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:07,240
Who does she think she is?

260
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,829
Do not be like that. He just can not hear us.

261
00:18:09,829 --> 00:18:11,849
Right .. He's sorry he can not hear.

262
00:18:11,849 --> 00:18:12,000
What? What? It's not even our fault. Right .. He's sorry he can not hear.

263
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,829
What? What? It's not even our fault.

264
00:18:13,829 --> 00:18:17,759
- That's right ... That's true. - You're just a bunch of fools who are crazy about him.

265
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:19,170
No, we're not like that.

266
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:20,090
<i> Are you stupid? (Kouhei) </ i></i>

267
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,589
Just because these people,

268
00:18:22,589 --> 00:18:24,639
<i> You are alone in a place like that. (Under the tree) </ i></i>

269
00:18:27,009 --> 00:18:28,970
Avoid interacting with others.

270
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:34,110
You do not have to come.

271
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,440
So what if he can not hear?

272
00:18:41,109 --> 00:18:44,029
He's a bitch for being cool.

273
00:18:46,779 --> 00:18:47,990
Stop ...

274
00:18:48,869 --> 00:18:51,959
- What are you talking about? - It's stopped.

275
00:19:07,509 --> 00:19:09,009
It's their fault,

276
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:11,309
already interrupt my lunch.

277
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:17,230
Taiichi.

278
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:21,150
Finally you say my name.

279
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:25,950
Eh? That ... You have not mentioned my name yet.

280
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:27,240
Had it earlier.

281
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:31,620
When you left I called you Kouhei.

282
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,710
Are you laughing?

283
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,039
No ... no ... I'm not laughing.

284
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:39,839
You laugh right?

285
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:43,379
If you laugh enough, then.

286
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,720
I often hear your laughter.

287
00:19:46,549 --> 00:19:48,349
Is that so often?

288
00:19:49,259 --> 00:19:51,769
Hmm .. Yeah.

289
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:56,019
Though I think I'm always in a depressed fashion.

290
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:04,819
Those people were,

291
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,820
Why are you doing that?

292
00:20:07,819 --> 00:20:08,819
Ha?

293
00:20:09,329 --> 00:20:11,490
They have nothing to do with you, you should just ignore them.

294
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,250
Moreover,

295
00:20:16,539 --> 00:20:18,460
I can not hear them.

296
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,250
What do you mean?

297
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,470
Just because you can not hear, does not mean they can speak badly behind you.

298
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:28,390
Are you always like that?

299
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:32,100
If you can not hear, say it aloud!

300
00:20:32,099 --> 00:20:34,139
Ask for as much as anything.

301
00:20:34,849 --> 00:20:37,099
Why do you always dodge?

302
00:20:38,099 --> 00:20:39,309
Inability to hear ...

303
00:20:40,859 --> 00:20:42,569
... it's not even your fault, is it?

304
00:20:57,579 --> 00:20:58,789
Kouhei,

305
00:20:59,789 --> 00:21:01,379
Why are you crying?

306
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,279
A sudden hearing ability echoed, yes.

307
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:30,700
Although not necessarily because of high fever,

308
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,700
but it's been a while since symptoms have arisen,

309
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:36,950
It is almost impossible to improve the ability to hear it again.

310
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:41,130
It might be a good idea to use a hearing aid,

311
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,880
How?

312
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:46,550
That might help his hearing.

313
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,010
Want to apply for a disabled certificate?

314
00:21:57,769 --> 00:22:01,150
Everyone, welcome.

315
00:22:02,269 --> 00:22:05,519
I am your homeroom guard, Kitano Seiichi.

316
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,190
Please cooperate.

317
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:14,450
So, what if we start with self-introduction?

318
00:22:15,529 --> 00:22:16,450
But before that,

319
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:21,000
there is something that I want to convey to all of you.

320
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:35,140
Your friend, Sugihara, has a hearing loss,

321
00:22:36,349 --> 00:22:39,309
I hope you guys help as much as possible.

322
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,650
Already .. Please calm down.

323
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:52,069
Poor yes.

324
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,120
<i> I never feel sorry for myself. </ i></i>

325
00:22:56,079 --> 00:23:00,250
But I do not understand why I have to experience this kind of thing.

326
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:04,000
Why should I think like this? I do not understand.

327
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
<i> Poor, yes. </ i></i>

328
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:07,460
Wuah .. Seriusan?

329
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,170
Sick .. sick ..

330
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:10,340
Wow cool.

331
00:23:10,339 --> 00:23:11,549
Do not take it carelessly.

332
00:23:11,549 --> 00:23:14,089
It's really cool.

333
00:23:16,299 --> 00:23:17,680
What are you talking about?

334
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,930
Her sister is a model.

335
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:21,640
She is very beautiful.

336
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,020
Is there something wrong with your eyes?

337
00:23:24,019 --> 00:23:25,849
She's skinny, but still ugly.

338
00:23:25,849 --> 00:23:27,189
Your eyes are troubled.

339
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:28,570
How could it be?

340
00:23:28,569 --> 00:23:30,480
Sorry, what are you talking about?

341
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:33,530
Ah, he has a hearing problem.

342
00:23:33,529 --> 00:23:34,359
It sucks.

343
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:36,909
Not important ... We are not talking about anything important.

344
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:40,579
<i> Go. </ i></i>

345
00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:06,809
Sugihara-kun! Here I help!

346
00:24:06,809 --> 00:24:10,319
Ah, sorry what did you say?

347
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:10,980
Here I help.

348
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,940
I can do it myself.

349
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:15,490
It is okay. It's hard for you because you can not hear, right?

350
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:17,109
What's the connection trying?

351
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:21,829
I do not know what to do with people who speak fast like this.

352
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,290
I hope he speaks more slowly ..

353
00:24:24,829 --> 00:24:27,250
Uh, are you cold?

354
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,039
Hm?

355
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:29,250
I'm wondering are you cold?

356
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,339
What?

357
00:24:30,339 --> 00:24:32,049
I say, cold.

358
00:24:32,049 --> 00:24:34,669
Because your voice is a bit naughty.

359
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:41,970
Eh? Why?

360
00:24:48,269 --> 00:24:51,109
Why are you so quiet today?

361
00:24:51,609 --> 00:24:53,689
We have not seen each other, talk more.

362
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:58,490
Hey, what are you wearing in your ear?

363
00:24:58,490 --> 00:24:59,160
Earphone?

364
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:07,000
Kouhei.

365
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,880
Are you bored?

366
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:20,180
Then see you next month.

367
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,390
You've worked hard.

368
00:25:22,549 --> 00:25:24,720
I also want to go down, want to go together?

369
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,309
Good.

370
00:25:26,019 --> 00:25:28,309
The way you communicate more smoothly, yes.

371
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:32,610
... so here's how to pronounce soda in sign language.

372
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:33,570
<i> Sign language. </ i></i>

373
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:42,990
Can not they all hear?

374
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:43,579
Hmm?

375
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:45,580
No.

376
00:25:46,539 --> 00:25:50,170
They are here to get a sign language certificate.

377
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:54,380
Usually, deaf people have studied in extraordinary schools.

378
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,630
So they will not come here.

379
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:04,600
Am I also like that person?

380
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:07,219
You're not going down?

381
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,519
No, I'm coming.

382
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:10,190
Sorry.

383
00:26:11,849 --> 00:26:14,269
That's why I feel uncomfortable.

384
00:26:15,819 --> 00:26:17,189
Because behind this curtain,

385
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:19,490
no place for me.

386
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:34,079
I can not blame senpai if they have a bad view about me.

387
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,539
Why?

388
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,050
Before you,

389
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:42,380
oran who became note taker for me is his girlfriend senpai.

390
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:45,799
He took me to the hotel but I refused.

391
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:49,269
Then there are rumors everywhere.

392
00:26:49,269 --> 00:26:50,769
Did not you already reject it?

393
00:26:50,769 --> 00:26:52,769
Maybe somebody saw us in front of the hotel.

394
00:26:53,309 --> 00:26:55,059
So the rumors began to spread.

395
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:01,189
But,

396
00:27:03,029 --> 00:27:05,279
I do not really care how people judge me.

397
00:27:09,579 --> 00:27:11,659
Because of these things,

398
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,790
will continue to happen.

399
00:27:13,789 --> 00:27:15,750
Why did you decide to be alone?

400
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,380
Because people do treat me so long.

401
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,130
But I do not!

402
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:25,720
Not that out there is someone like me?

403
00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:30,639
Taiichi ... you are that,

404
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,650
suddenly appeared out of nowhere.

405
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:36,310
Two more times.

406
00:27:37,059 --> 00:27:38,309
So what?

407
00:27:38,309 --> 00:27:41,279
- Back then, I was thinking, is this guy stupid? - Ha ?!

408
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:45,240
Because you say the person who offers you food is a good person.

409
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:52,750
This time you really laugh, right?

410
00:27:55,829 --> 00:27:56,379
Hmm.

411
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,549
Wooah, this is the first time I've ever seen you laugh.

412
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,220
Tuh right,

413
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:08,100
You look better when smiling.

414
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:42,000
By the way, what is Taiichi's favorite food?

415
00:28:53,809 --> 00:28:56,889
Well, you rarely go to the kitchen,

416
00:28:56,890 --> 00:28:58,310
are you hungry?

417
00:28:58,309 --> 00:29:00,649
Bento create tomorrow what?

418
00:29:01,309 --> 00:29:02,269
Eh?

419
00:29:02,269 --> 00:29:03,230
What?

420
00:29:03,609 --> 00:29:06,569
This is the first time you ask that.

421
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:11,410
Ah, that's ... the guy who wrote me a note,

422
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:13,740
Loved my bent.

423
00:29:14,579 --> 00:29:16,369
Oh, I see.

424
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:20,079
So, what if spend a little longer to prepare tomorrow?

425
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,590
Oh, I see...

426
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:31,389
<i> Taiichi will be happy tomorrow, right? </ i></i>

427
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,030
So beitu.

428
00:29:45,779 --> 00:29:49,069
Today Taiichi does not need to write notes.

429
00:29:52,369 --> 00:29:54,579
Though the weather is good.

430
00:29:58,369 --> 00:29:59,750
Taiichi.

431
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:04,040
Taiichi ...

432
00:30:08,009 --> 00:30:09,089
That is true.

433
00:30:10,049 --> 00:30:13,509
There's a part in Taiichi life where I'm not there.

434
00:30:13,509 --> 00:30:15,470
And, he also has his own friends.

435
00:30:16,769 --> 00:30:18,430
Hey, Kouhei!

436
00:30:31,859 --> 00:30:33,199
<i> Again I wish. </ i></i>

437
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:38,160
<i> Taiichi is with me for my reward </ i>.</i>

438
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:41,500
<i> Besides, she has no reason to be with me. </ i></i>

439
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,960
<i> Nevertheless, </ i></i>

440
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:48,549
It's not your fault you can not hear.

441
00:30:48,549 --> 00:30:50,549
<i> I'm glad. </ i></i>

442
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,300
Kouhei.

443
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:57,930
Just now why?

444
00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:01,519
You see me but ignore me ... It's sick to know!

445
00:31:02,349 --> 00:31:03,230
Eh?

446
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:04,230
Why?

447
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,860
What do you mean?

448
00:31:05,859 --> 00:31:07,399
I'm not asking you to write a note today.

449
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,650
So without a note we can not chat?

450
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:21,450
Do-do,

451
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:24,000
because you want to eat my bait?

452
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,920
Nothing to do with bento.

453
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,340
[Pavlov Dog: A passionate dog to be fed] Stop treating me like a Pavlov dog.

454
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:32,220
See. Because of this,

455
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:35,049
I remember that I'm hungry.

456
00:31:39,509 --> 00:31:44,599
Then ... Let's eat together.

457
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:46,230
Yes, but I do not have the money.

458
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:50,230
I brought bento.

459
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:53,240
You are a God!

460
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:58,410
You're too much.

461
00:31:58,410 --> 00:31:59,910
No ... you're too good.

462
00:32:00,289 --> 00:32:01,829
The best?

463
00:32:03,079 --> 00:32:05,919
I do not know who it is.

464
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,500
Hey ... you know dong.

465
00:32:10,299 --> 00:32:12,210
I want to see the bentonya.

466
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:14,670
I am very hungry.

467
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,180
Wahh .. Is not this Steak Hamburger?

468
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:20,809
You do not like it?

469
00:32:20,809 --> 00:32:22,429
How could I not like it?

470
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:24,640
I really like it till I want to marry her.

471
00:32:25,809 --> 00:32:26,980
Thank God.

472
00:32:35,529 --> 00:32:37,490
I always thought,

473
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,029
are you the one who made this bento?

474
00:32:40,529 --> 00:32:42,039
Yours is very tasty yes.

475
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:44,789
Not possible lah. My mother made it.

476
00:32:44,789 --> 00:32:47,329
He teaches cooking classes.

477
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:51,799
I can not remember the taste of my mother's cooking.

478
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,920
Is it true?

479
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:57,130
My parents divorced when I was in junior high.

480
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:02,180
When they were married again, I lived with my grandfather.

481
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:03,930
Sorry.

482
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:06,560
Ti-no nothing, I have not thought about it.

483
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:11,480
But I think, hamburger steak is very tasty, yes.

484
00:33:12,609 --> 00:33:14,439
Finally met, Taiichi!

485
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,320
Yoko.

486
00:33:16,819 --> 00:33:18,029
Hello.

487
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:21,119
I forgot to tell you,

488
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:23,029
Do you know my cousin, Miho?

489
00:33:23,029 --> 00:33:24,660
He's also studying here.

490
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,580
This is the first time I know you have a cousin.

491
00:33:26,579 --> 00:33:30,250
Miho suddenly asks for your contact number.

492
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,710
Why?

493
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:33,799
He said he saw you in the cafeteria.

494
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:34,589
Stop it.

495
00:33:34,589 --> 00:33:36,009
He said he wants to chat with you.

496
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:38,880
Are you feeling excited?

497
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,510
Stop it.

498
00:33:40,509 --> 00:33:42,549
Not to be taken seriously, what are you looking like?

499
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:43,930
You...

500
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:47,180
That is all. Please take care of the rest. Bye bye.

501
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,390
Hey, Yoko!

502
00:33:50,099 --> 00:33:52,059
What is wrong with her?

503
00:33:58,450 --> 00:33:59,490
Why?

504
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:02,240
Hm? Oh no. There is no.

505
00:34:08,909 --> 00:34:12,459
It's really nice, yes.

506
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,440
Sagawa-kun?

507
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:39,070
Are you her cousin Yoko?

508
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:42,200
Nice to meet you, I'm Yokohama Miho.

509
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:44,199
Nice to meet you.

510
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:46,329
Sorry, suddenly asked you to get out.

511
00:34:46,329 --> 00:34:47,369
Oh, it is okay.

512
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:55,250
By the way, lots of books here.

513
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:58,210
Oh, here is actually a bookstore.

514
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:00,050
Good marketing, right?

515
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:01,470
Please.

516
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,800
Oh, the hourly rate is high.

517
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:08,310
I want iced tea.

518
00:35:08,309 --> 00:35:10,309
Iced tea? OK.

519
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:16,650
So, here it is,

520
00:35:17,269 --> 00:35:18,230
Yes.

521
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:23,949
The thing I want to talk about is ... about Sugihara-kun.

522
00:35:24,199 --> 00:35:26,619
Hah?! Kouhei?

523
00:35:26,619 --> 00:35:30,039
At that time I saw him in the cafeteria, he was very handsome.

524
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:32,079
The two of you seem close enough.

525
00:35:32,829 --> 00:35:35,500
Ah .. So that's it?

526
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,460
Ah, sorry.

527
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:40,960
I asked my cousin because I thought you were very close.

528
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:42,840
Am I bothering you?

529
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,260
Not. No problem.

530
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:46,760
So he, what does he usually do?

531
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,970
Something he likes or his hobbies?

532
00:35:51,269 --> 00:35:53,230
I do not understand about those things.

533
00:35:54,309 --> 00:35:55,980
Are you two in the same department?

534
00:35:56,309 --> 00:35:57,269
Not.

535
00:35:57,269 --> 00:35:58,400
We're different.

536
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,690
Then in the same club?

537
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:03,610
We both did not join the club.

538
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:06,739
Then how can you know each other?

539
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:11,580
We both do not know each other intentionally,

540
00:36:11,579 --> 00:36:12,789
I wonder how?

541
00:36:13,869 --> 00:36:16,880
In essence, I'm now helping him as a note taker.

542
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,130
Note taker?

543
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:20,840
Yes, he has a little hearing problem,

544
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,920
he could not hear the lecture material clearly.

545
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,840
Or things that matter.

546
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,840
So I wrote it down and gave it to him.

547
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,350
Sugihara-kun can not hear?

548
00:36:30,349 --> 00:36:32,679
No, instead of not being able to hear,

549
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:34,599
he is not completely deaf.

550
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:35,639
Only trouble hearing.

551
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:36,190
Oh, I see,

552
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:39,900
Like the main character in the novel.

553
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:40,900
What?

554
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:45,110
The main character of women accidentally met with the main male character who lost his hearing,

555
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:47,280
And the seeds of love began to grow between them but,

556
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,410
I really like this novel.

557
00:36:49,409 --> 00:36:53,159
The main character of women always helps the main male character, it is very touching.

558
00:36:53,159 --> 00:36:56,210
I always hoped to be able to use sign language,

559
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:58,630
but there was no such person who appeared near me.

560
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:01,250
For some reason, now I feel like I'm the main character in the novel.

561
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:03,880
Mother,

562
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:06,880
Can you make a bento for tomorrow?

563
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,930
Yes yes.

564
00:37:07,929 --> 00:37:09,589
Two, right?

565
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:14,220
Anu ...

566
00:37:14,219 --> 00:37:15,179
What?

567
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,059
I have a request.

568
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:26,440
What? Why are you so serious?

569
00:37:31,739 --> 00:37:32,489
Why?

570
00:37:32,489 --> 00:37:34,619
He can communicate fluently even without sign language.

571
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:36,750
And also, he's not really deaf.

572
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:39,289
He can do anything himself.

573
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:42,789
Do not equate him with the characters in the novel.

574
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:46,460
Sorry.

575
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:49,179
Maybe for you this is just a novel,

576
00:37:49,179 --> 00:37:51,929
but for him, this is the reality.

577
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:02,769
Sorry.

578
00:38:20,579 --> 00:38:21,460
I am home.

579
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:24,000
Grandfather?

580
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:26,500
Not at home yes.

581
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:36,970
[On holiday to hot springs]

582
00:38:37,809 --> 00:38:40,230
Must say something before leaving.

583
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,730
What the fuck is this day?

584
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:55,369
Why did I say that?

585
00:39:01,289 --> 00:39:03,000
Indeed i am her?

586
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:10,670
I just want to see her laugh more.

587
00:39:21,809 --> 00:39:22,519
Here,

588
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,809
note for today.

589
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:47,590
Why?

590
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:48,840
Not.

591
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,880
It's rare to see you're not excited.

592
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:55,050
No, I'm just hungry.

593
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,640
What is bento today?

594
00:40:00,179 --> 00:40:01,429
Steak hamburger!

595
00:40:02,059 --> 00:40:03,730
Because you said you wanted to marry her.

596
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:05,230
I like! I like it very much.

597
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:08,059
But I'm not sure what it feels like.

598
00:40:08,059 --> 00:40:09,190
What do you mean?

599
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:10,650
Of course this is good.

600
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:14,360
Your mother's bento is always delicious.

601
00:40:18,909 --> 00:40:19,659
Enaak ..

602
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:21,740
Very delicious...

603
00:40:23,079 --> 00:40:24,409
Thank God..

604
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:32,090
I want to check the note today first,

605
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:33,010
Hmm.

606
00:40:49,019 --> 00:40:50,110
What I said then,

607
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,900
though I said I did not care about what happened to my parents,

608
00:40:56,989 --> 00:40:59,819
I've actually felt depressed.

609
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:03,739
Because without parents, people began to look down on me.

610
00:41:04,659 --> 00:41:07,079
And also, the fact that I'm poor makes the situation worse.

611
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:09,539
That's why I often get into a fight.

612
00:41:09,539 --> 00:41:12,380
There were also times when I ran away from home.

613
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,090
But,

614
00:41:16,219 --> 00:41:17,629
on my birthday,

615
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:21,099
Grandpa made me a burnt hamburger steak.

616
00:41:22,349 --> 00:41:23,849
Since then,

617
00:41:24,679 --> 00:41:27,690
I am grateful to be living with my grandfather.

618
00:41:29,349 --> 00:41:31,610
The hamburger steak was as good as it was.

619
00:41:33,369 --> 00:41:34,359
Thanks.

620
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:37,199
Are you saying something?

621
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,360
Not important anyway.

622
00:41:39,739 --> 00:41:40,239
Eh?

623
00:41:40,949 --> 00:41:42,239
Not important.

624
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:44,449
Sorry, I did not hear.

625
00:41:44,449 --> 00:41:45,949
I myself am ashamed to say so.

626
00:41:49,369 --> 00:41:50,119
Is it true?

627
00:41:54,210 --> 00:41:55,630
Buzzed again.

628
00:41:58,170 --> 00:41:58,840
What is wrong?

629
00:42:01,469 --> 00:42:02,139
Kouhei!

630
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:04,809
Kouhei.

631
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,690
I can not...

632
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:18,190
... heard Taiichi's voice.

633
00:43:10,619 --> 00:43:12,869
Your hearing ability deteriorates.

634
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:18,210
Perhaps because it is deteriorating slowly,

635
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:19,550
you do not realize it.

636
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:23,090
The buzz can be caused by this,

637
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:28,559
but can also be caused by other complications.

638
00:43:29,349 --> 00:43:30,809
So it needs further inspection.

639
00:43:30,809 --> 00:43:32,139
Can you come again next week?

640
00:43:32,139 --> 00:43:32,769
Ano ...

641
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:39,280
My listening ability will worsen slowly?

642
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,280
Does that mean one day ...

643
00:43:48,949 --> 00:43:51,000
... will I be totally deaf?

644
00:43:52,659 --> 00:43:54,420
I still can not decide.

645
00:43:55,369 --> 00:43:59,380
But do not give up.

646
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:02,300
Too much pressure is not good for your health.

647
00:44:05,179 --> 00:44:08,719
It's hard for you to resist life ...

648
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:13,389
... environment with people who have normal hearing.

649
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:24,570
<i> My listings got worse. </ i></i>

650
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:28,030
<i> Also, </ i></i>

651
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:31,040
<i> I probably will not be able to hear the things I've been hearing forever. </ i></i>

652
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:39,039
<i> This </ i>.</i>

653
00:44:39,539 --> 00:44:40,800
I can do it, right?

654
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,170
Call me by my first name .. I will do the same.

655
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:45,050
Sagawa Taiichi.

656
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:46,180
<i> Kouhei </ i>!</i>

657
00:44:46,179 --> 00:44:49,139
<i> You look better with a smile. </ i></i>

658
00:44:49,139 --> 00:44:50,719
<i> Steak hamburger .. </ i></i>

659
00:44:50,719 --> 00:44:51,389
<i> Like </ i>.</i>

660
00:44:51,389 --> 00:44:52,309
<i> I love it so much. </ i></i>

661
00:44:52,309 --> 00:44:55,179
<i> Delicious .. Very tasty. </ i></i>

662
00:44:55,179 --> 00:44:56,980
<i> You ignore me even though you see me, </ i></i>

663
00:44:57,349 --> 00:44:58,349
<i> That's painful! </ i></i>

664
00:44:58,349 --> 00:45:00,400
<i> If you do not hear it, just say it aloud! </ i></i>

665
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,610
<i> You can request any number of times. </ i></i>

666
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,990
Kouhei .... Kouhei..Kouhei ..

667
00:45:07,659 --> 00:45:12,199
<i> All things I can hear up to now, </ i></i>

668
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,500
Loh? Sugihara?

669
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:24,460
Ah, it's true.

670
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:36,389
Have you heard what happened from Taiichi?

671
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:37,230
What?

672
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:38,849
About Miho.

673
00:45:39,099 --> 00:45:41,230
Sorry, I can not hear you clearly.

674
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:43,860
Ah .. It's okay, it's nothing.

675
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:44,650
Sorry Sorry.

676
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:48,490
He said you're okay.

677
00:45:48,489 --> 00:45:50,739
That's all Miho's fault.

678
00:45:52,369 --> 00:45:53,949
Miho?

679
00:45:54,909 --> 00:45:59,039
It turns out Taiichi did not tell you anything?

680
00:46:00,369 --> 00:46:01,630
What happened between them?

681
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:05,090
Yes .. Not so also,

682
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:06,960
In fact,

683
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:09,680
I do not know if you're aware,

684
00:46:09,679 --> 00:46:20,480
but it looks like Miho is not interested in Taiichi, but with you.

685
00:46:21,349 --> 00:46:24,440
Taiichi would not be happy to have been lied to.

686
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:28,900
And he also seems disappointed.

687
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:30,530
She looked depressed.

688
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,200
What happened to you?

689
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:41,710
Sugihara?

690
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:50,260
<i> Why does not Taiichi tell me about the girl? </ i></i>

691
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:05,849
I will wait for you at the temple of Hachiman

692
00:47:05,849 --> 00:47:06,569
Kouhei? I will wait for you at the temple of Hachiman

693
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:08,610
I will wait for you at the temple of Hachiman

694
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:11,950
Kouhei!

695
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:15,780
Sorry I'm late.

696
00:47:16,619 --> 00:47:17,489
Taiichi.

697
00:47:17,989 --> 00:47:20,289
Why do you bring an umbrella if you do not use it?

698
00:47:22,409 --> 00:47:23,539
Do you want to wear my towel?

699
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:25,460
Hold on for a moment.

700
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:29,090
It is okay.

701
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:31,720
No ... You're gonna get the flu.

702
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:41,389
Suddenly I realized,

703
00:47:41,389 --> 00:47:42,599
What?

704
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:47,570
I realize how much I want to meet you.

705
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,070
What? You really like me huh?

706
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:54,910
Yes.

707
00:47:58,530 --> 00:47:59,410
I like you..

708
00:48:00,369 --> 00:48:01,199
Taiichi.

709
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:08,000
Seeing you who so enjoy your food,

710
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:10,340
I feel so comfortable.

711
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:12,670
What?

712
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,550
Every time you say good,

713
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,220
I feel so happy.

714
00:48:21,349 --> 00:48:26,480
I'm afraid I can not hear your voice anymore.

715
00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:29,650
What is wrong? Did something happen?

716
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:33,490
Kouhei?

717
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:36,160
Hey! You are okay?

718
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:37,780
Kouhei.

719
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:44,659
Taiichi,

720
00:48:45,829 --> 00:48:48,039
how do you feel about Miho?

721
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:49,960
You met, right?

722
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:51,340
Yes.

723
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:54,840
Why are you angry with him?

724
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:56,380
What do you mean?

725
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:58,720
Anyway how do you know?

726
00:49:00,510 --> 00:49:02,810
Why are you asking this?

727
00:49:02,809 --> 00:49:04,809
Why do you ask?

728
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,440
Because this is important to me.

729
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:15,900
<i> What did the girl say to Taiichi? </ i></i>

730
00:49:16,570 --> 00:49:18,240
<i> How do you see it from your perspective? </ i></i>

731
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:20,570
Not.

732
00:49:22,989 --> 00:49:23,829
Taiichi.

733
00:49:24,699 --> 00:49:28,039
Sorry, but I will not let you know.

734
00:49:28,829 --> 00:49:29,960
And I will not tell you.

735
00:49:57,070 --> 00:49:58,030
<i> Taiichi </ i>.</i>

736
00:50:00,449 --> 00:50:01,739
<i> sorry if suddenly. </ i></i>

737
00:50:09,289 --> 00:50:11,789
<i> You've helped me a lot. </ i></i>

738
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:13,590
<i> Therefore, </ i></i>

739
00:50:13,590 --> 00:50:16,300
<i> I do not want to trouble you anymore. </ i></i>

740
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:21,470
<i> I will ask others to become my Note Taker. </ i></i>

741
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:34,150
Where are you, Kouhei.

742
00:50:40,449 --> 00:50:42,639
<i> [Sorry for bothering you for this long, Goodbye.] </ i></i>

743
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:44,579
Sorry to bother you. <i> [Sorry for bothering you for this long, Goodbye.] </ i></i>

744
00:50:44,579 --> 00:50:44,829
<i> [Sorry for bothering you for this long, Goodbye.] </ i></i>

745
00:50:47,659 --> 00:50:48,789
Goodbye.

746
00:50:53,539 --> 00:50:55,590
I do not understand.

747
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:13,059
She is not coming today?

748
00:51:13,059 --> 00:51:14,900
What? Sugihara lai?

749
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:16,980
She has not been in for more than a week.

750
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:18,690
He may try to avoid you.

751
00:51:18,690 --> 00:51:20,490
Have you hurt her yet?

752
00:51:20,489 --> 00:51:21,359
No!

753
00:51:23,199 --> 00:51:24,069
I do not know.

754
00:51:24,070 --> 00:51:26,660
Is it hard to get in touch with that person?

755
00:51:26,659 --> 00:51:32,409
Eh but I got to meet and talk to him, and it's not as hard as my shadow.

756
00:51:32,409 --> 00:51:33,500
When did you talk to him?

757
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:36,380
I told him about what Miho asked you.

758
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:38,960
You tell him about Miho?

759
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,090
Sick..sakit..sakit .. what's wrong? Ill woy!

760
00:51:41,090 --> 00:51:42,300
What did you tell him?

761
00:51:43,179 --> 00:51:48,099
I told you that Miho actually likes Sugihara not you.

762
00:51:48,099 --> 00:51:48,759
You!

763
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:51,600
Besides, if you're so eager to see him, why do not you just go to his house?

764
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:52,980
I do not know where his house is.

765
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:53,940
Sick..she ... pain ...

766
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:56,309
Does not the family have a cooking course?

767
00:51:56,309 --> 00:51:57,980
You can look it up on the internet.

768
00:51:58,519 --> 00:52:00,650
- That is true. - Pain oy!

769
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:17,170
Woaahh .. The house is very big.

770
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,130
<i> [Cooking Suihara Course] </ i></i>

771
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:20,380
I get nervous.

772
00:52:27,179 --> 00:52:28,469
Iyaa ~~

773
00:52:33,349 --> 00:52:34,889
Eh? Who?

774
00:52:35,889 --> 00:52:37,769
I'm his friend Kouhei.

775
00:52:39,610 --> 00:52:40,820
Is Kouhei at home?

776
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:47,740
Forgive me.

777
00:52:47,739 --> 00:52:49,909
Her friend Kouhei has never been here before.

778
00:52:49,909 --> 00:52:52,079
So I thought you were here for the course.

779
00:52:52,659 --> 00:52:54,329
Ah, sit down first.

780
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:09,800
The boy never told me.

781
00:53:10,929 --> 00:53:12,429
Sorry there's only cookies.

782
00:53:12,429 --> 00:53:13,809
Please eat, yes.

783
00:53:13,809 --> 00:53:15,230
Oh no.

784
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:16,769
It's my fault that suddenly came here.

785
00:53:16,769 --> 00:53:19,190
Please do not hesitate .. Eat yes.

786
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:22,820
Then eat good.

787
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:29,320
Uwenaakk!

788
00:53:34,449 --> 00:53:39,250
Ah, .. So all this time she gave her bentonya for you, huh.

789
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,130
Yes.

790
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:44,880
Kouhei often talks about you.

791
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,300
He said there are children who really like to eat.

792
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:52,390
So where is Kouhei?

793
00:53:53,309 --> 00:53:54,179
That boy?

794
00:53:54,679 --> 00:53:57,099
He is now at the hospital..so not at home.

795
00:53:57,099 --> 00:53:58,230
Hospital?

796
00:53:59,059 --> 00:54:03,610
Yes. It seems his hearing is slowly deteriorating.

797
00:54:04,269 --> 00:54:07,650
This week she did a physical check and got an IV.

798
00:54:08,489 --> 00:54:09,949
It would be great if he was hospitalized.

799
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:11,870
But he does not want to.

800
00:54:16,409 --> 00:54:18,000
So so yes.

801
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:24,250
I want to go home first,

802
00:54:24,250 --> 00:54:26,550
Sorry to have made you wait for this long,

803
00:54:26,550 --> 00:54:28,260
he may soon arrive.

804
00:54:29,550 --> 00:54:31,470
Thank you kuenya.

805
00:54:31,469 --> 00:54:32,299
Wait.

806
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:33,510
Yes?

807
00:54:35,929 --> 00:54:40,389
Are you willing to stay beside Kouhei?

808
00:54:40,849 --> 00:54:41,559
Eh?

809
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:48,570
The child is introverted, lacks socializing and always keeps distance ... He is very difficult to approach.

810
00:54:50,070 --> 00:54:55,740
But he seems pretty close to you.

811
00:54:58,250 --> 00:55:01,039
When he finds out if you really like a hamburger steak,

812
00:55:01,039 --> 00:55:02,920
he asked me to make it.

813
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:05,090
Even asked me to make it even better.

814
00:55:05,090 --> 00:55:07,170
So I asked him to make it himself.

815
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:10,590
Very strange..

816
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:13,139
She had never cooked before.

817
00:55:13,929 --> 00:55:15,639
But he really meant it.

818
00:55:23,849 --> 00:55:25,860
Why? Am I wrong?

819
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:27,190
No, you did well.

820
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:36,409
He really wants to hear you say good.

821
00:55:48,550 --> 00:55:49,630
I am home.

822
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:51,970
Ah, welcome.

823
00:55:51,969 --> 00:55:53,379
You're late.

824
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:56,349
And if you go home early you can meet him.

825
00:55:56,349 --> 00:55:57,179
Eh?

826
00:55:57,849 --> 00:55:59,469
The bento.

827
00:55:59,469 --> 00:56:02,389
He's been here waiting for you.

828
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:20,450
Why did he never say anything to me?

829
00:56:21,699 --> 00:56:23,909
Why does he always decide everything himself?

830
00:56:24,329 --> 00:56:25,289
Shit.

831
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:28,000
<i> Is not she avoiding you? </ i></i>

832
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,670
Maybe you hurt him already.

833
00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:31,000
I do not.

834
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:36,430
Taiichi ... What do you think about Miho?

835
00:56:37,510 --> 00:56:40,560
Why are you angry with him?

836
00:56:46,230 --> 00:56:47,559
Kouhei ...

837
00:56:48,059 --> 00:56:49,110
Perhaps...

838
00:57:04,829 --> 00:57:05,619
Taiichi!

839
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:07,579
Why did not you pick up your phone?

840
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:09,920
Sorry. my phone is missing.

841
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,289
What happened?

842
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:14,260
By the way, have you met Sugihara?

843
00:57:17,179 --> 00:57:18,299
Not yet.

844
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,890
But this seems to be my salary.

845
00:57:21,889 --> 00:57:22,559
What does it mean?

846
00:57:23,849 --> 00:57:26,940
He probably likes Miho.

847
00:57:28,019 --> 00:57:29,900
It's not possible. You think about it too much.

848
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:34,940
Yes but if he misunderstands and thinks I like Miho ...

849
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:36,780
... maybe that's why he's avoiding me.

850
00:57:38,110 --> 00:57:40,990
He let me have Miho.

851
00:57:40,989 --> 00:57:44,409
He was afraid that would interfere so he dodged.

852
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:46,829
He's that kind of person.

853
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:50,210
I do not understand ...

854
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:54,550
After all, why are you so attentive to Sugihara?

855
00:57:56,010 --> 00:58:00,470
He is very smart,

856
00:58:00,469 --> 00:58:02,299
good cook,

857
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:03,720
also popular among girls.

858
00:58:03,719 --> 00:58:05,719
I just thought he was great.

859
00:58:05,719 --> 00:58:07,309
He is too perfect.

860
00:58:07,309 --> 00:58:11,190
But he is very lacking in self-confidence.

861
00:58:12,110 --> 00:58:14,230
Do not want to hang out with people around him,

862
00:58:14,769 --> 00:58:16,320
Always try to do everything yourself.

863
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:22,870
Just because he has a hearing problem ... Things do not go the way he wants.

864
00:58:23,159 --> 00:58:28,079
I do not know what it is that makes her not confident.

865
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:30,500
I feel guilty for her.

866
00:58:31,670 --> 00:58:34,789
What's wrong with not hearing?

867
00:58:35,670 --> 00:58:37,710
That...

868
00:58:37,710 --> 00:58:39,929
Kouhei is a good person.

869
00:58:40,510 --> 00:58:42,760
Though he's a quiet person and closed.

870
00:58:43,090 --> 00:58:44,680
But he's really good.

871
00:58:46,059 --> 00:58:47,719
You alone do not know.

872
00:58:47,929 --> 00:58:50,099
How he has tried hard ....

873
00:58:51,809 --> 00:58:53,480
... with that quiet expression of his face.

874
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:57,400
Actually no one is trying to understand it,

875
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:58,530
and excommunicate it,

876
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:01,450
with a bad opinion about it.

877
00:59:01,449 --> 00:59:03,699
What you say is true, but ...

878
00:59:03,699 --> 00:59:07,039
Bottom line, I can not leave it alone!

879
00:59:07,039 --> 00:59:08,539
Can not!

880
00:59:08,539 --> 00:59:10,500
Taiichi ... That's enough.

881
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:11,329
So what?

882
00:59:11,619 --> 00:59:15,250
He's at the door.

883
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:20,050
Stupid! you should have said that!

884
00:59:20,469 --> 00:59:21,969
That's because you keep talking.

885
00:59:24,139 --> 00:59:24,799
This...

886
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:27,390
You left him at my house.

887
00:59:27,719 --> 00:59:29,219
- Te-thank you, - See you later.

888
00:59:29,219 --> 00:59:31,219
Kouhei!

889
00:59:32,809 --> 00:59:33,769
Taiichi?

890
00:59:33,769 --> 00:59:34,980
Wait!

891
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:37,820
Did you hear what I was talking about?

892
00:59:38,610 --> 00:59:40,940
I'm wondering do you hear it?

893
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:42,200
Hey!

894
00:59:42,989 --> 00:59:44,109
Kouhei!

895
00:59:48,909 --> 00:59:50,619
So what if I hear it?

896
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:58,000
You already know, right?

897
00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:00,710
If my listening worsened from before.

898
01:00:05,050 --> 01:00:06,640
Even if you say something,

899
01:00:08,050 --> 01:00:09,350
I will not be able to hear it.

900
01:00:11,639 --> 01:00:12,679
Oh, I see?

901
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:18,900
Sorry...

902
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:21,480
... I'm lying.

903
01:00:29,409 --> 01:00:31,289
Even if I can hear other people's voices,

904
01:00:33,329 --> 01:00:34,829
I do not know why ...

905
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,500
... just your voice that sounds clear.

906
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:49,050
Why do you have to say that?

907
01:00:50,719 --> 01:00:52,429
Do not you just say that?

908
01:00:53,059 --> 01:00:54,679
Not that you are alone?

909
01:00:55,639 --> 01:00:58,519
Trying to break off a relationship with me with a message like that,

910
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:02,440
your own fault for not expressing your true feelings.

911
01:01:06,909 --> 01:01:07,609
Because,

912
01:01:09,659 --> 01:01:12,869
- even if I say it you will not understand! - What do you mean?

913
01:01:13,659 --> 01:01:15,289
Even though I do not understand everything,

914
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:18,630
I will try to understand it little by little.

915
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:23,590
After seeing you cry that time,

916
01:01:25,469 --> 01:01:28,799
How can I understand if you keep silent?

917
01:01:30,010 --> 01:01:32,060
You should say everything you want to say!

918
01:01:36,269 --> 01:01:37,440
About Miho,

919
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:40,110
It is my fault.

920
01:01:42,650 --> 01:01:44,610
He said if you're useless,

921
01:01:45,820 --> 01:01:47,070
IAM very angry.

922
01:01:48,489 --> 01:01:50,069
If I knew this would make a misunderstanding between us,

923
01:01:51,739 --> 01:01:53,329
it should be from the beginning I tell you the truth.

924
01:01:55,079 --> 01:01:56,159
Therefore,

925
01:01:57,789 --> 01:02:00,000
stop trying to bear it on your own.

926
01:02:01,579 --> 01:02:04,000
Just tell me what you want to say.

927
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:06,760
Do not give up on yourself.

928
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:21,440
Why?

929
01:02:22,269 --> 01:02:24,019
Why Taiichi cry?

930
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:26,230
Where I know.

931
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:49,840
You did not understand me.

932
01:02:53,219 --> 01:02:54,389
[Meaning about Kouhei feeling like Taiichi (Taiichi is not sensitive: v)] You're too slow.

933
01:02:57,139 --> 01:02:58,099
But...

934
01:02:58,849 --> 01:03:00,769
.. that's what I like about you.

935
01:03:04,610 --> 01:03:05,360
In fact,

936
01:03:06,269 --> 01:03:11,199
Rather than lose my hearing, I'm more afraid that you hate me.

937
01:03:15,949 --> 01:03:16,989
Forgive me.

938
01:03:19,449 --> 01:03:19,829
But,

939
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:22,829
I'm glad I told you this.

940
01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:29,340
Thank you...

941
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:33,220
... for your time all this time.

942
01:05:53,019 --> 01:05:54,230
Uh, Sugihara-kun?

943
01:05:54,230 --> 01:05:55,360
You cut your hair?

944
01:05:55,690 --> 01:05:56,440
Yes.

945
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:59,360
- Cute .. Fit with you .. - You look cool ...

946
01:06:00,110 --> 01:06:02,450

Of course. You can join ..

951
01:06:17,469 --> 01:06:18,969
But why all of a sudden?

952
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:23,140
I was thinking that I should not have stopped before trying.

953
01:06:25,010 --> 01:06:26,270
So you want to join?

954
01:06:26,269 --> 01:06:26,769
Yes.

955
01:06:26,769 --> 01:06:27,349
Hurray ..

956
01:06:27,349 --> 01:06:29,389
You will come right?

957
01:06:29,389 --> 01:06:30,059
OK.

958
01:06:31,559 --> 01:06:32,059
Serious?

959
01:06:32,059 --> 01:06:32,980
Yes.

See you again..

962

Kouhei.

963
01:07:16,940 --> 01:07:17,860
Am I imagining?

964
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:19,780
Kouhei!

965
01:07:25,659 --> 01:07:26,699
Why?

966
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:28,909
Is it weird if I come through here?

967
01:07:29,789 --> 01:07:30,659
Taiichi ..

968
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:32,920
Oh yes..

969
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:38,460
This is it...

970
01:07:40,050 --> 01:07:41,800
Wait a minute ,,,

971
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:48,640
You do not mind that time?

972
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:51,179
You really do not want to see me, do you?

973
01:07:53,190 --> 01:07:54,309
That time...

974
01:07:55,150 --> 01:07:58,519
... I was just surprised and did not know what to do.

975
01:07:58,940 --> 01:08:03,570
I keep thinking about it until I forget to eat.

976
01:08:04,489 --> 01:08:05,489
But,

977
01:08:05,869 --> 01:08:11,119
no matter how hard I think about it, I have no reason to hate you.

978
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:13,329

984
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:28,050
can you hear me?

985
01:08:32,140 --> 01:08:33,060
Hmm.

986
01:08:35,350 --> 01:08:36,730
Very clear.

987
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,439
Since winter when I was 8th grade,

988
01:08:41,859 --> 01:08:44,529
My days are like frosty winters.

989
01:08:46,109 --> 01:08:48,159
Memories filled with solitude,

990
01:08:50,699 --> 01:08:55,619
Until I heard a warm, sun-like sound.

991
01:08:58,039 --> 01:08:59,710
I do not know why,

992
01:09:02,130 --> 01:09:03,710
only your voice I can hear.
