1
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,060
Safe!

2
00:01:44,533 --> 00:01:45,647
Off belay!

3
00:01:50,497 --> 00:01:52,739
Right, can you get my camera out,
please?

4
00:01:58,671 --> 00:02:00,545
Say it.

5
00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:03,292
- Come on.
- Don't take a picture.

6
00:02:03,384 --> 00:02:07,512
Give us a smile. I'm sure there's a
pretty face under that frown somewhere.

7
00:02:12,059 --> 00:02:15,095
- Is that the best you got?
- Afraid so.

8
00:02:15,187 --> 00:02:17,760
- OK, get one of me.
- No, I'll take it at the top.

9
00:02:17,856 --> 00:02:20,347
Yeah, but I wanna get
some of this background in.

10
00:02:20,442 --> 00:02:21,817
Pass it over.

11
00:02:24,446 --> 00:02:27,363
Try and get some of that exposure in.
Show how high up we are.

12
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:29,322
Is that a golden eagle?

13
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,040
Beautiful.

14
00:02:38,126 --> 00:02:40,451
It's a golden eagle.
Buzzard. I don't know

15
00:02:40,545 --> 00:02:42,870
Nah, it's way too big to be a buzzard.

16
00:02:50,763 --> 00:02:54,428
Alright, that's enough of the bird.
Point the camera at the money.

17
00:02:55,434 --> 00:02:56,928
Alison, come on.

18
00:02:58,604 --> 00:03:00,513
- Stop pouting.
- What?

19
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,731
It was a golden eagle.

20
00:03:48,943 --> 00:03:51,648
- Alison! Help me!
- Ed!

21
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,198
Jesus Christ, Alison!

22
00:03:55,867 --> 00:03:58,025
- Shit!
- Rob, throw the rope.

23
00:03:58,119 --> 00:03:59,198
- Guys!
- Alison!

24
00:03:59,287 --> 00:04:03,580
- Ed!
- Alison, please! It's slipping!

25
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:05,326
It's gonna go!

26
00:04:09,922 --> 00:04:14,251
I can't... I can't...
I can't get up!

27
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,047
- Help me!
- Rob!

28
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,635
Rob!

29
00:04:25,311 --> 00:04:28,727
- Ed, just breathe!

30
00:04:28,815 --> 00:04:31,306
- It's not gonna hold!
- Ed! Ed!

31
00:04:31,401 --> 00:04:34,022
Ed, you have to listen to me.
Just breathe.

32
00:04:50,794 --> 00:04:53,546
It's OK, but stop moving.
Keep it together.

33
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:54,958
Alright, alright.

34
00:04:55,048 --> 00:04:57,290
Easy. OK, OK. Get your breath.

35
00:04:57,384 --> 00:05:00,254
Get your breath.
Jesus Christ, what happened, guys?

36
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:04,966
- Alison, are you alright?
- Don't ask. Yeah, I'm fine.

37
00:05:05,058 --> 00:05:08,758
Alright, mate, you're alright.
OK. Can you just pull yourself up?

38
00:05:08,853 --> 00:05:10,892
- Thank God.
- Alison, you OK?

39
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,889
- I'm fine.
- Alright.

40
00:05:12,982 --> 00:05:15,769
It's OK, keep going.
Just get your breath.

41
00:08:01,143 --> 00:08:03,349
I lost my bloody camera.

42
00:08:03,937 --> 00:08:06,392
I feel sick
and my hands won't stop shaking.

43
00:08:06,481 --> 00:08:09,932
It's the adrenaline lag, mate.
Always hits you afterwards.

44
00:08:11,527 --> 00:08:12,808
Hey, Ed.

45
00:08:13,696 --> 00:08:16,697
Don't ever have a concentration lapse
like that again, OK?

46
00:08:16,782 --> 00:08:19,404
You wanna climb with me,
you need to up your game.

47
00:08:19,493 --> 00:08:22,198
Methodical, every step. I mean it.

48
00:08:22,329 --> 00:08:25,414
Complacency is a killer out here.

49
00:08:25,499 --> 00:08:27,907
- We got away with cuts and bruises.
- Yeah.

50
00:08:30,504 --> 00:08:32,959
Remind me why we do this again.

51
00:08:33,882 --> 00:08:35,673
Because we don't surf.

52
00:08:55,987 --> 00:08:57,362
- Hey.
- Hey.

53
00:08:57,446 --> 00:09:00,233
- Hey.
- Hey. How you doing, honey?

54
00:09:02,117 --> 00:09:06,495
- What time did you get here?
- About an hour ago. Just unpacking.

55
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:11,364
Yeah, we took the double room
with the en suite. If that's OK?

56
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,452
Fine. I'm not sleeping with him, am I?

57
00:09:14,546 --> 00:09:16,005
Neither am I.

58
00:09:18,216 --> 00:09:20,256
- I'm Ed, by the way.

59
00:09:20,343 --> 00:09:23,261
Oh, Ed. I'm sorry, mate.
Ed, Jenny. Jenny, this is Ed.

60
00:09:23,346 --> 00:09:24,377
Hi, Ed.

61
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,558
No, after you.

62
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,271
OK?

63
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:41,856
Oh, right.

64
00:09:45,742 --> 00:09:48,779
Oh, honey, can you bring me
the cutlery, please, babe?

65
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,697
It's in the jug on the dresser.

66
00:09:51,707 --> 00:09:53,616
Smells like someone's died in here.

67
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:57,042
Yeah, it is a little stinky.
I'll open a window, let some air in.

68
00:09:58,088 --> 00:10:00,376
That's just what Fred West
would have said.

69
00:10:00,465 --> 00:10:03,170
In future, you should
bury your relatives outdoors.

70
00:10:03,259 --> 00:10:04,588
Think patio.

71
00:10:04,677 --> 00:10:08,591
If we had a phone in here, mate, you
could call up the landlord and complain.

72
00:10:08,681 --> 00:10:10,839
- There's no phone?
- No.

73
00:10:10,933 --> 00:10:12,178
Great.

74
00:10:14,478 --> 00:10:18,143
And the window... is bust.

75
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,102
Any joy?

76
00:10:24,196 --> 00:10:26,235
We've had a right result.

77
00:10:59,354 --> 00:11:01,561
Hey, don't worry about her.

78
00:11:02,441 --> 00:11:06,770
You know, with a bit of luck, she'll be
tucked up and fast asleep by now.

79
00:11:07,446 --> 00:11:09,901
Your parents are such a pushover.

80
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:13,074
She runs rings round them.
She's such a little monkey.

81
00:11:15,286 --> 00:11:16,615
I miss her.

82
00:11:17,538 --> 00:11:19,697
It's only been two days, Jen.

83
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:21,871
Hmm.

84
00:11:40,978 --> 00:11:42,353
Bollocks.

85
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,831
- No, no, no!

86
00:12:13,926 --> 00:12:17,508
It's horrible. Girls, girls, stop.
Seriously, it's horrible.

87
00:12:17,596 --> 00:12:20,846
- Please, cards, go.
- OK. OK.

88
00:12:20,932 --> 00:12:22,308
But, erm...

89
00:12:22,392 --> 00:12:25,642
Right, I need to know how much
one of these fellas is worth.

90
00:12:25,729 --> 00:12:27,389
Five matchsticks. Er!

91
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,525
- Er, no sex for you.

92
00:12:31,609 --> 00:12:36,070
- And, OK, a bottle top?
- Two pasta swirls to a top.

93
00:12:36,948 --> 00:12:41,241
Right. So then, ten matchsticks
makes one bottle top?

94
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:42,951
Yeah.

95
00:12:43,037 --> 00:12:46,737
Great. OK, thanks, guys.
It's a bit confusing, is all.

96
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:48,741
It really isn't.

97
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:51,455
- Be nice.
- What are you doing, Jen?

98
00:12:51,587 --> 00:12:53,828
Ladies and gentlemen, I fold.

99
00:12:55,132 --> 00:12:58,382
- What have you got that's so special?
- Erm...

100
00:12:58,468 --> 00:13:01,884
A pasta swirl and two tops
is what I'm gonna raise by.

101
00:13:01,972 --> 00:13:04,130
- I fold.
- Me, too.

102
00:13:05,558 --> 00:13:08,808
I'm gonna keep him honest. All in.

103
00:13:10,772 --> 00:13:13,097
The water's warm. Jump on in.

104
00:13:14,275 --> 00:13:16,149
Yeah, right. Erm, all in.

105
00:13:21,657 --> 00:13:23,733
- Three kings.
- Whoa.

106
00:13:23,826 --> 00:13:27,870
- Oh, damn, I've only got three tens.
- A-ha! Get in, yer dancer!

107
00:13:27,955 --> 00:13:31,240
Come here, you lovely, lovely little...

108
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:33,207
Oh, look at his wee face.

109
00:13:33,293 --> 00:13:35,618
I've got a pair of queens as well,
if that helps.

110
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:43,051
Oh, come on, sit down, Alex. Shock's
best absorbed with the knees bent.

111
00:13:44,387 --> 00:13:47,092
Full house. Let him take it.

112
00:13:47,181 --> 00:13:49,388
Don't spend it all in one pub.

113
00:13:49,976 --> 00:13:52,182
I can retire to the Bahamas
like Roger Moore.

114
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:54,939
- You mean Sean Connery.
- I'm in the Roger Moore camp.

115
00:13:55,022 --> 00:13:58,687
There's nothing wrong with
a little bit of camp.

116
00:13:58,776 --> 00:14:00,685
That's a horrible impression.

117
00:14:00,778 --> 00:14:02,188
- It isn't.
- It is.

118
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:03,310
It's not!

119
00:14:07,993 --> 00:14:09,986
Alex, what is this?
Where's the Queen?

120
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:12,450
That's legal tender.
It's a Scottish tenner.

121
00:14:12,539 --> 00:14:15,955
It's worse than Monopoly money.
I can't buy anything with this.

122
00:14:16,042 --> 00:14:18,118
I've only got two words for you.

123
00:14:18,211 --> 00:14:21,627
- Yeah, do they involve sex and travel?
- Possibly.

124
00:14:21,714 --> 00:14:23,209
Well, don't say them.

125
00:14:23,299 --> 00:14:26,383
That's our cue to leave.
Goodnight, everybody.

126
00:14:30,556 --> 00:14:33,510
- Fuck off!
- Leave it. Goodnight!

127
00:14:34,143 --> 00:14:35,721
Another round?

128
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,307
Look, baby, I'm sorry.
I'm pissed. It was just banter.

129
00:14:39,398 --> 00:14:43,098
- Yeah. I know. But it's not very sexy.
- I'm not trying to be sexy.

130
00:14:43,193 --> 00:14:45,649
Why not? You're not on a promise.

131
00:14:51,284 --> 00:14:53,954
- Deal.
- Will do.

132
00:14:57,707 --> 00:15:00,328
Stick with me, we'll climb that
this time next year.

133
00:15:00,418 --> 00:15:02,991
The Eiger? Yeah, let's do it.
The north face.

134
00:15:04,714 --> 00:15:06,422
It killed 70 people.

135
00:15:08,009 --> 00:15:12,053
If you fall from the summit,
it'll take 30 seconds to hit the ground.

136
00:15:12,555 --> 00:15:15,674
- That's cheery.
- 30 seconds to recall your life,

137
00:15:15,766 --> 00:15:18,222
say your goodbyes, conscious
the whole way down.

138
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:20,468
Just enough time to say
the Lord's Prayer.

139
00:15:20,562 --> 00:15:24,939
- If you believe that's gonna save you.
- You're really gonna need something.

140
00:15:29,488 --> 00:15:32,903
- It's blowing a bastard out there.
- Yeah, I know.

141
00:15:32,991 --> 00:15:35,945
It's, er, supposed to clear up
through the night, though.

142
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:38,277
But tomorrow is gonna be tricky.

143
00:15:39,831 --> 00:15:41,159
Drink?

144
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:43,788
Fill her up.

145
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:47,459
- No, you can't mix gin and whisky.
- It's called a gisky.

146
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:48,922
- Is it?
- I just invented it.

147
00:15:49,006 --> 00:15:50,584
- Right.
- Gisky?

148
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:54,132
- Gisky. Would you like one?
- No, I'll pass.

149
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:08,804
Alright, folks, slight change
of plan, I think.

150
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:12,234
There are 40mph winds on that peak,
but they're gusting 60.

151
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,781
It's supposed to die down tonight, so I
think we'll do the west face tomorrow

152
00:16:16,866 --> 00:16:19,238
and just tackle the north ridge today.

153
00:16:19,327 --> 00:16:21,782
It's nothing more than a diff.
You know, V diff.

154
00:16:21,871 --> 00:16:25,868
So don't worry about rock shoes, helmets
or anything that'll weigh you down.

155
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:28,116
We've got a lot of ground to cover.

156
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:29,918
How's the exposure on the ridge?

157
00:16:30,004 --> 00:16:32,874
A bit thought provoking,
but keep hold of your harness.

158
00:16:32,965 --> 00:16:36,168
- I've got mine and we'll take the rope.
- OK, good.

159
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,299
Got all your gear?
Don't leave anything.

160
00:16:38,387 --> 00:16:41,174
The only thing I left is for
a fully qualified plumber.

161
00:16:41,264 --> 00:16:42,593
Charming.

162
00:16:44,851 --> 00:16:47,176
- Good morning.
- Hey, how's the head?

163
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:50,473
Two cups of coffee and three aspirin,
I'm almost human again.

164
00:16:52,442 --> 00:16:53,521
OK?

165
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:55,935
So I guess it's a no-go
on the west face, hmm?

166
00:16:56,029 --> 00:16:59,693
No. This isn't Yosemite. The weather
up here does exactly what it wants.

167
00:16:59,824 --> 00:17:01,104
Yeah.

168
00:17:03,744 --> 00:17:06,579
- Got the lunch, Jen?
- Yeah, that's all under control.

169
00:17:06,664 --> 00:17:09,415
- What are we having?
- Sandwiches.

170
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:14,043
Ah. The pinnacle of British cuisine.
No wonder the French hate us.

171
00:17:14,129 --> 00:17:17,000
- I make a pretty good sandwich.
- Well, what's in them?

172
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:19,546
Just wait and see.
The surprise is half the fun.

173
00:17:19,634 --> 00:17:21,627
Just as long as it's not fish.

174
00:17:23,847 --> 00:17:26,053
You should try one. They're yummy.

175
00:17:26,141 --> 00:17:29,177
Smoked mackerel and egg?
I'd rather eat my own shit.

176
00:17:29,269 --> 00:17:31,427
No one's stopping you.

177
00:17:31,521 --> 00:17:35,388
You could always scrape out the mackerel
and just eat the bread.

178
00:17:35,483 --> 00:17:38,056
No, I can't do that. It's been tainted.

179
00:17:38,152 --> 00:17:39,730
You remind me of my daughter.

180
00:17:39,862 --> 00:17:42,234
She's clearly a lady of impeccable taste.

181
00:17:42,323 --> 00:17:43,521
She's two.

182
00:17:45,576 --> 00:17:48,992
You're such a fussy eater.
It's so surprising at your age.

183
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:51,700
Surprise is half the fun, right?

184
00:17:51,832 --> 00:17:53,659
Thank fuck I brought chocolate.

185
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,420
Five minutes and we're off.
Everybody OK with that?

186
00:17:56,503 --> 00:17:58,163
Sounds good.

187
00:18:06,012 --> 00:18:07,175
It's beautiful.

188
00:18:08,264 --> 00:18:11,016
I know. Scenery like this
makes me wish I could paint.

189
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,345
I'm gonna take a piss.

190
00:18:12,435 --> 00:18:15,519
- Yeah, good to know.
- Thought you might be interested.

191
00:18:15,605 --> 00:18:18,605
No, no, mate, you feel free
to keep us updated at all times.

192
00:18:18,691 --> 00:18:20,150
Will do.

193
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:26,648
I've found a cracking spot.
I'm unbuttoning my fly.

194
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,117
I'm getting it out.
Fucking hell, it weighs a ton.

195
00:18:31,203 --> 00:18:32,578
Shut up, wanker.

196
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:58,597
Hey, guys! I heard something.

197
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:00,644
Oh, yeah, what?

198
00:19:00,731 --> 00:19:05,192
I dunno. Something.
Come here and check it out.

199
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:07,566
Mate, you think I'm falling for that?

200
00:19:09,197 --> 00:19:10,692
I'm serious.

201
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:25,669
What is it?

202
00:19:27,882 --> 00:19:30,207
- What's going on up there?
- Hold on a sec!

203
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:33,218
Just listen.

204
00:19:35,764 --> 00:19:37,342
D'you hear that?

205
00:19:40,853 --> 00:19:42,644
I heard it.

206
00:19:42,729 --> 00:19:44,769
- What is it then?
- An animal?

207
00:19:45,732 --> 00:19:47,524
- No way.
- Then what?

208
00:19:47,609 --> 00:19:49,602
- Sounds to me like...
- Like what?

209
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,060
A person.

210
00:19:54,991 --> 00:19:57,909
- Guys, get over here.
- What is it?

211
00:19:57,994 --> 00:19:59,785
Just get over here.

212
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:17,130
- What is it?
- Shh. Listen.

213
00:20:23,226 --> 00:20:26,180
- I hear it.
- Yeah, me too.

214
00:21:22,658 --> 00:21:23,856
What is that?

215
00:21:23,951 --> 00:21:25,576
I've no idea.

216
00:21:32,126 --> 00:21:34,663
- Shit.
- What?

217
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:38,044
It's a breathing tube.

218
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:41,044
There's someone down there.

219
00:21:41,843 --> 00:21:43,302
Just wait here, guys. Wait!

220
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:12,613
Hello?

221
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:15,707
- Jesus Christ!

222
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,920
- Jesus Christ.
- What the hell is that?

223
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,714
Don't you mean who?

224
00:22:26,594 --> 00:22:27,839
What do we do?

225
00:22:29,889 --> 00:22:30,968
Ed.

226
00:22:33,267 --> 00:22:35,011
Wait a sec, guys.

227
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,179
Hello?

228
00:22:40,191 --> 00:22:42,148
If you can hear us, say something!

229
00:22:44,361 --> 00:22:45,476
Oh, Jesus.

230
00:22:46,238 --> 00:22:48,563
This was dug recently.
The earth's still soft.

231
00:22:48,657 --> 00:22:50,400
Why would somebody be down there?

232
00:22:50,492 --> 00:22:53,528
- I told you I heard something.

233
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:56,158
We're gonna help you.
Just sit tight for a moment.

234
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,204
- What are you doing?
- We don't know what's down there.

235
00:23:01,294 --> 00:23:03,370
- It sounds like a child.
- I think so, too.

236
00:23:03,463 --> 00:23:05,420
We can think, but we don't fucking know.

237
00:23:05,506 --> 00:23:07,914
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Guys, it's made of wood.

238
00:23:09,385 --> 00:23:12,836
- See if we can find the corners.
- This is insane. What are you doing?

239
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:15,552
Get down here! Help us.
Fucking kneel down and help.

240
00:23:15,641 --> 00:23:17,883
- Come on!

241
00:23:20,229 --> 00:23:23,479
Right, we're gonna try
and lift it, OK? On three.

242
00:23:23,565 --> 00:23:26,270
One, two, three.

243
00:23:29,821 --> 00:23:31,399
Fuck.

244
00:23:32,074 --> 00:23:34,113
- Oh, my God.
- Jesus.

245
00:23:37,871 --> 00:23:39,863
Alright. Hello.

246
00:23:40,832 --> 00:23:44,367
Now don't be afraid. We're gonna
get you out of there. Alright?

247
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,789
Ed?

248
00:23:46,921 --> 00:23:48,830
- Come on.

249
00:23:48,923 --> 00:23:51,675
No, no, no. Don't worry,
we're not gonna hurt you.

250
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:54,843
OK, darling? We're not gonna hurt you.
Come on.

251
00:23:56,764 --> 00:23:59,515
For fuck's sake, you're scaring her!
Leave her alone.

252
00:24:01,435 --> 00:24:03,973
It's OK, sweetie.

253
00:24:04,104 --> 00:24:05,847
Alright. Alright.

254
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:07,971
It's OK.

255
00:24:09,026 --> 00:24:12,359
It's alright. I'm not gonna hurt you.

256
00:24:12,445 --> 00:24:15,530
It's OK. We're gonna get you out of here.

257
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,359
Come on, sweetie.

258
00:24:18,451 --> 00:24:20,159
It's alright.

259
00:24:21,204 --> 00:24:23,777
It's OK. Good girl. It's OK.

260
00:24:26,709 --> 00:24:28,749
It's OK.

261
00:24:29,629 --> 00:24:32,546
- OK, honey. Help.
- OK.

262
00:24:33,841 --> 00:24:35,086
OK.

263
00:24:35,175 --> 00:24:38,675
Let's get you out of here.
Come up. Come up.

264
00:24:38,762 --> 00:24:40,470
Can you get me some water?

265
00:24:45,018 --> 00:24:48,185
Sit down. It's alright,
it's alright. OK.

266
00:24:48,271 --> 00:24:51,972
OK. OK. Here you go. There you go.

267
00:24:53,401 --> 00:24:57,150
Slowly. Drink slowly.
Slowly, slowly, slowly.

268
00:24:57,238 --> 00:25:00,441
Alright. Good girl.

269
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:03,783
Oh. Alright. It's OK.

270
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:06,740
It's alright, it's alright. It's OK.

271
00:25:09,125 --> 00:25:10,785
Sweetie, can you tell...

272
00:25:12,169 --> 00:25:15,503
Can you tell me your name? Your name?

273
00:25:16,423 --> 00:25:19,459
I'm Jenny. Jenny.

274
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:22,420
What's your name?

275
00:25:22,512 --> 00:25:24,671
- Anna.
- Anna.

276
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:27,307
OK, Anna.

277
00:25:28,602 --> 00:25:31,970
- Anna, where are you from?

278
00:25:36,192 --> 00:25:38,398
OK. Alright.

279
00:25:41,572 --> 00:25:44,692
Anna, do you speak English?

280
00:25:44,784 --> 00:25:50,454
Anna? English? Does anyone know
what language that is?

281
00:25:50,539 --> 00:25:52,615
I dunno. Is it Russian, maybe?

282
00:25:52,708 --> 00:25:55,874
- Might be Croatian.
- How do you know that?

283
00:25:55,961 --> 00:25:59,626
Well, I had an ex-girlfriend from Zagreb
and she'd swear at me in Croat.

284
00:25:59,715 --> 00:26:02,751
- You're sure that's what it is?
- She used to swear at me a lot.

285
00:26:02,843 --> 00:26:06,425
- Can you understand what she's saying?
- No. The accent sounds familiar.

286
00:26:06,513 --> 00:26:08,589
Well, do you speak any Croat?

287
00:26:08,681 --> 00:26:10,888
I could score an eighth,
ask for a threesome.

288
00:26:10,975 --> 00:26:12,767
- Ah, Jesus.
- Oh, for God's sake.

289
00:26:12,852 --> 00:26:15,308
- Dick.
- Sorry.

290
00:26:15,396 --> 00:26:19,725
- Why would someone do this?
- They didn't want her to die.

291
00:26:21,485 --> 00:26:24,023
Otherwise there wouldn't be an air pipe.

292
00:26:24,113 --> 00:26:27,861
I don't want to know who put her
down there or why they did it.

293
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:30,488
I just want to get out of here
before they come back.

294
00:26:30,577 --> 00:26:33,068
Listen, listen.
She's our responsibility now.

295
00:26:33,205 --> 00:26:35,363
We've got to get help.
We've got to get her

296
00:26:35,958 --> 00:26:37,701
off these mountains soon.

297
00:26:39,377 --> 00:26:45,416
OK. Right, we're here, 12 miles
south-southwest of Alltnacaillich.

298
00:26:45,508 --> 00:26:48,260
The nearest village is Annan Mor, so...

299
00:26:48,344 --> 00:26:50,088
Yeah.

300
00:26:50,179 --> 00:26:54,047
We could go east along the Scimitar
Ridge until we get to the river,

301
00:26:54,142 --> 00:26:57,510
then double back to the village.
It's about 15, 20 miles all in.

302
00:26:57,603 --> 00:27:00,806
I found this in the hole.
She must've been down there for days.

303
00:27:00,898 --> 00:27:03,934
- Did she have any food?
- Didn't look like it.

304
00:27:04,026 --> 00:27:07,644
She must have been starving
down there all by herself in the dark.

305
00:27:07,738 --> 00:27:10,276
Let's not kill her with
a smoked mackerel sandwich.

306
00:27:10,365 --> 00:27:12,654
Can we use your phone? Phone for help?

307
00:27:12,743 --> 00:27:14,320
What, in these mountains?

308
00:27:14,411 --> 00:27:17,780
Won't get anything approaching
a signal till you get near the A9.

309
00:27:17,873 --> 00:27:19,367
That's about 30 miles away.

310
00:27:19,457 --> 00:27:21,948
You said it was 15 miles to the village.

311
00:27:23,503 --> 00:27:26,919
There is a faster route.
We're only two miles from Devil's Drop.

312
00:27:27,006 --> 00:27:30,375
- What's Devil's Drop?
- The only way to breach the ridge.

313
00:27:30,468 --> 00:27:32,959
It's a sheer cliff face
500 foot straight down,

314
00:27:33,054 --> 00:27:37,265
but from there, it is only
a four-mile hike to Annan Mor.

315
00:27:37,975 --> 00:27:40,015
How do we get a child down Devil's Drop?

316
00:27:40,978 --> 00:27:44,311
We don't. Two of us abseil down
and run to the village for help,

317
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:47,933
alert the police and get the Highland
Rescue to pick up the rest of you.

318
00:27:48,026 --> 00:27:51,395
- Who are you gonna take with you?
- Alison.

319
00:27:51,488 --> 00:27:54,275
Sorry, Ed, no arguments, mate.
I need the best.

320
00:27:54,366 --> 00:27:58,577
It's a massive face, Rob.
I mean, we don't have enough rope.

321
00:27:58,662 --> 00:28:00,868
I've got 20 metres of seven mil
if that helps.

322
00:28:00,955 --> 00:28:02,699
No, no, you keep that with you.

323
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:06,159
There's some rough terrain.
You might need it. We'll manage.

324
00:28:06,294 --> 00:28:09,710
- We'll multi pitch it. It'll be fine.
- Do you want us to wait here?

325
00:28:09,797 --> 00:28:12,003
No. There's no way we're staying here.

326
00:28:12,091 --> 00:28:16,967
Follow the route on the map. I'll make
sure they get the helicopter out to you.

327
00:28:17,054 --> 00:28:20,090
As long as you stick to that route,
they'll find you easily.

328
00:28:59,803 --> 00:29:02,840
- Yeah, that's it. There it is. See?
- Where?

329
00:29:02,931 --> 00:29:05,683
That's the Haston Step.
It's the first belay point.

330
00:29:16,402 --> 00:29:19,688
- You wanna go first?
- Yeah.

331
00:30:14,708 --> 00:30:16,167
Rob?

332
00:30:17,836 --> 00:30:20,541
Fuck! Rob, there's no more rope.

333
00:30:20,631 --> 00:30:23,003
Can you make it?

334
00:30:29,431 --> 00:30:32,550
- Easy.
- Shit. Shit!

335
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:35,553
Easy.

336
00:31:14,182 --> 00:31:18,179
Alison! How is it?

337
00:31:18,269 --> 00:31:19,846
Fucking scary, Rob.

338
00:31:21,313 --> 00:31:24,765
There's no footholds for five feet.
You be careful, OK?

339
00:32:00,392 --> 00:32:01,803
Rob!

340
00:32:06,732 --> 00:32:10,432
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

341
00:32:10,527 --> 00:32:14,026
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

342
00:32:28,461 --> 00:32:32,126
Look, why don't we carry her?
Me and Ed could take it in turns.

343
00:32:32,215 --> 00:32:33,874
- Makes sense.
- OK.

344
00:32:35,301 --> 00:32:36,878
- Come on.
- Here you go.

345
00:32:36,969 --> 00:32:38,843
Be gentle.

346
00:32:38,929 --> 00:32:40,258
Anna!

347
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:44,095
- Come on.
- Jesus Christ!

348
00:32:44,184 --> 00:32:45,560
- Put her down.
- Whoa.

349
00:32:47,854 --> 00:32:50,939
Right, so what do we do now?
You won't be able to carry her.

350
00:32:51,441 --> 00:32:55,818
- I can try.
- You'll collapse after 100 yards.

351
00:32:56,863 --> 00:32:58,523
Then we'll go at Anna's pace.

352
00:32:58,615 --> 00:33:01,402
- That's pretty fucking slow.
- Watch your language.

353
00:33:01,493 --> 00:33:03,734
- She can't understand.
- Hardly the point.

354
00:33:03,828 --> 00:33:07,031
- For fuck's sake.
- We've gotta keep moving. Come on.

355
00:33:07,123 --> 00:33:09,744
Do you have any idea
what she's been through?

356
00:33:09,834 --> 00:33:13,666
I get it, OK?
Can we just go now? Please?

357
00:33:15,131 --> 00:33:16,411
- Come on.
- OK.

358
00:33:16,507 --> 00:33:18,749
Come on, sweetie. We have to go.

359
00:34:17,774 --> 00:34:18,972
Fuck!

360
00:34:20,902 --> 00:34:22,064
Jesus!

361
00:34:24,113 --> 00:34:26,070
Fuck. Fuck it. Fuck!

362
00:34:37,084 --> 00:34:39,788
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

363
00:36:40,035 --> 00:36:41,445
Hey!

364
00:36:43,955 --> 00:36:45,034
Hey!

365
00:36:48,084 --> 00:36:49,708
Help!

366
00:36:58,594 --> 00:36:59,969
Fuck you!

367
00:37:01,722 --> 00:37:03,465
Fuck you.

368
00:38:22,299 --> 00:38:23,841
It's been cut!

369
00:38:38,815 --> 00:38:41,436
I think it's about a mile away
to the river.

370
00:38:50,993 --> 00:38:52,487
There they are.

371
00:38:57,291 --> 00:39:00,494
- I see them.
- How far?

372
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:04,789
400 yards, maybe more.

373
00:39:04,881 --> 00:39:08,831
- You got a shot?
- At this range?

374
00:39:10,345 --> 00:39:13,299
Don't waste it.
Let's get over that next ridge.

375
00:39:41,917 --> 00:39:43,327
There they are.

376
00:39:50,467 --> 00:39:53,752
Chuck us over your hip flask
and give me a nip.

377
00:40:02,103 --> 00:40:04,391
What is this filthy shit?

378
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,683
- It's spirit drink.
- Spirit drink?

379
00:40:07,775 --> 00:40:11,903
I got it at the petrol garage. It's so
cheap they can't even call it vodka.

380
00:40:11,987 --> 00:40:14,739
- It's pish.
- It gets the job done.

381
00:40:23,873 --> 00:40:25,154
Hello there.

382
00:40:26,042 --> 00:40:27,453
Good afternoon.

383
00:40:29,963 --> 00:40:31,789
What are you fellas doing out here?

384
00:40:32,757 --> 00:40:34,334
Hiking.

385
00:40:36,928 --> 00:40:39,216
Long way from civilisation.

386
00:40:39,305 --> 00:40:41,179
That's the idea.

387
00:40:41,265 --> 00:40:42,676
You stalking?

388
00:40:43,726 --> 00:40:44,924
Yeah.

389
00:40:45,769 --> 00:40:48,604
You know the hunting season's been over
for three months?

390
00:40:48,731 --> 00:40:50,011
What do you care?

391
00:40:51,316 --> 00:40:55,314
It's just if you're hunting out of
season, we're gonna have to report you.

392
00:40:56,363 --> 00:40:58,236
That's a pretty big gun.

393
00:40:58,323 --> 00:41:01,858
It's a 308. It'll put a dent
in just about anything.

394
00:41:03,495 --> 00:41:05,617
You think the deer
have a fighting chance?

395
00:41:06,372 --> 00:41:08,994
I think everything's
got a fighting chance.

396
00:41:11,044 --> 00:41:12,538
Do you?

397
00:41:12,628 --> 00:41:15,250
You boys a pair of animal rights
wankers, are you?

398
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:16,917
You're a long way from anywhere.

399
00:41:17,008 --> 00:41:20,459
Me and him don't take kindly to
left-wing bastards coming out here...

400
00:41:24,598 --> 00:41:28,845
Please. Oh, please, don't do it.
I'll stop hunting.

401
00:41:29,436 --> 00:41:31,844
But everything's got a fighting chance,
right?

402
00:41:34,524 --> 00:41:36,232
He said that.

403
00:41:37,402 --> 00:41:39,441
Please. Please don't kill me.

404
00:41:39,529 --> 00:41:41,189
Take a step back.

405
00:41:41,281 --> 00:41:43,854
- Oh, God, please. Please, no.
- Hey.

406
00:41:45,034 --> 00:41:46,149
Do it.

407
00:41:47,453 --> 00:41:49,576
- Jesus Christ.
- Keep going.

408
00:41:49,664 --> 00:41:51,288
Oh, God, no.

409
00:41:51,374 --> 00:41:53,283
That's it.

410
00:41:53,376 --> 00:41:55,452
- And another.
- Please. Oh, fuck.

411
00:41:55,544 --> 00:41:58,581
- Don't stop.
- Oh, dear God!

412
00:42:09,433 --> 00:42:10,808
And that's that.

413
00:42:25,323 --> 00:42:26,437
You still with me?

414
00:42:29,619 --> 00:42:31,113
Whatever it takes.

415
00:42:31,704 --> 00:42:34,111
I think it might take a bit more
than we thought.

416
00:42:37,585 --> 00:42:40,289
Aye. It might.

417
00:42:53,058 --> 00:42:55,097
How did they sound?

418
00:42:55,185 --> 00:42:58,968
Practised. In control. Like they knew
exactly what they were doing.

419
00:42:59,063 --> 00:43:01,222
That's usually a good sign.

420
00:43:01,316 --> 00:43:02,644
Follow the road.

421
00:43:02,734 --> 00:43:07,027
- Remind me of the name of this place.
- Annan Mor. Southwest of Inverness.

422
00:43:07,113 --> 00:43:08,986
Still a good 80 miles.

423
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:32,965
Hey!

424
00:43:35,348 --> 00:43:36,759
Hey!

425
00:43:36,891 --> 00:43:40,640
Look. Look. Look. Alison.

426
00:43:42,647 --> 00:43:44,972
The rope was cut.

427
00:43:45,066 --> 00:43:49,644
The rope was cut.
Someone cut the rope.

428
00:43:49,737 --> 00:43:52,109
- Can you hear her?
- She's smashed her legs up.

429
00:43:52,197 --> 00:43:55,282
You can see it in her leg and her arms.
Something's wrong, Jen.

430
00:43:56,535 --> 00:43:58,693
It's alright, sweetheart,
don't be scared.

431
00:43:58,787 --> 00:44:00,067
Don't be scared. It's OK.

432
00:44:00,163 --> 00:44:04,872
Someone cut the rope. Rob was murdered.

433
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,332
- Can you hear what she's saying?
- Look at her leg.

434
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:10,587
We can't understand
a word you're saying.

435
00:44:13,927 --> 00:44:17,212
I need to get across to you
further down the river.

436
00:44:17,305 --> 00:44:22,595
Alison! Alison, you're gonna
have to shout louder.

437
00:44:22,685 --> 00:44:25,935
We need to find a crossing
further downstream.

438
00:44:28,941 --> 00:44:32,808
She wants us to go down the river.
OK, OK. Where's Rob?

439
00:44:32,945 --> 00:44:34,522
Rob, where is he?

440
00:44:34,613 --> 00:44:36,237
Where is he?

441
00:44:46,666 --> 00:44:47,947
Fuck!

442
00:44:54,007 --> 00:44:56,165
What are we gonna do, Jen?

443
00:44:59,428 --> 00:45:01,220
What do we do?

444
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:07,435
No.

445
00:45:19,531 --> 00:45:22,200
- Jen! Jenny!
- Alex!

446
00:45:22,284 --> 00:45:25,699
- Jenny! Jenny!

447
00:45:25,787 --> 00:45:27,115
Alex, Alex, Alex, no!

448
00:45:27,205 --> 00:45:29,494
Jenny! Jenny! Jenny!

449
00:45:29,582 --> 00:45:32,500
- Listen to me. Alex!
- Jenny, give me your hand.

450
00:45:36,297 --> 00:45:37,625
Alex, she's gone!

451
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:41,873
We can't get her from here.
We've gotta go down there.

452
00:45:53,397 --> 00:45:55,722
Ed, Ed, I can see her.

453
00:45:57,025 --> 00:46:00,773
Hold on to the rocks, Jen.
Hold on to the rocks.

454
00:46:06,826 --> 00:46:09,032
- Hold on to the rocks!
- Alex, listen to me.

455
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:11,825
You have to follow me.
I know what I'm doing. Follow me.

456
00:46:48,491 --> 00:46:49,570
Alison!

457
00:46:51,369 --> 00:46:52,697
Alison!

458
00:46:54,663 --> 00:46:56,490
Come on, come on!

459
00:47:33,659 --> 00:47:35,237
Anna!

460
00:47:38,163 --> 00:47:39,408
Anna!

461
00:47:45,545 --> 00:47:47,205
Anna!

462
00:48:29,629 --> 00:48:30,874
No. Gone.

463
00:48:35,843 --> 00:48:36,958
There!

464
00:48:54,027 --> 00:48:55,687
Anna!

465
00:48:56,572 --> 00:48:59,738
Anna! Anna!

466
00:48:59,825 --> 00:49:01,782
Anna!

467
00:50:04,345 --> 00:50:06,670
Come on, Anna.

468
00:50:06,764 --> 00:50:08,970
Come on, Anna. Come on.

469
00:50:18,984 --> 00:50:20,810
OK. Anna.

470
00:50:30,912 --> 00:50:32,821
It's OK, Anna.

471
00:51:22,628 --> 00:51:25,878
Anna! Anna!

472
00:51:56,577 --> 00:51:58,819
Alex. Alex.

473
00:52:02,374 --> 00:52:04,034
Are you alright?

474
00:52:05,043 --> 00:52:06,206
Look at me.

475
00:52:09,089 --> 00:52:13,086
- We have to find the others, OK?
- Right.

476
00:52:13,176 --> 00:52:14,836
Ed!

477
00:52:16,137 --> 00:52:17,168
Anna?

478
00:52:20,725 --> 00:52:22,682
Ed!

479
00:53:09,730 --> 00:53:12,138
- Here!

480
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:56,690
Ed.

481
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:58,234
Anna.

482
00:53:58,318 --> 00:53:59,729
Ed.

483
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:05,773
Anna. Thank God. Shh. Shh.

484
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:11,319
What happened?

485
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:14,949
I fell. It might be broken,
I don't know.

486
00:54:22,049 --> 00:54:23,876
They're coming.

487
00:54:23,968 --> 00:54:25,378
- How many?
- Two.

488
00:54:25,469 --> 00:54:27,094
Shit.

489
00:54:30,432 --> 00:54:33,005
- OK, let's go.
- No. He can't run.

490
00:54:33,101 --> 00:54:36,055
- I can try.
- That won't be enough.

491
00:54:38,565 --> 00:54:43,523
Look, listen. You, me, Ed,
we don't mean a thing to these people.

492
00:54:43,611 --> 00:54:47,276
She's the only one with any value.
She's what they want.

493
00:54:56,165 --> 00:54:57,196
That's her!

494
00:55:00,878 --> 00:55:03,416
- What about the others?
- Follow the money!

495
00:57:03,370 --> 00:57:06,205
Are you gonna finish him
or do you want me to do it?

496
00:57:06,289 --> 00:57:10,334
After what he's just put us through?
No, I wanna watch him breathe out.

497
00:57:20,386 --> 00:57:22,130
You feel that?

498
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:26,512
That's the price of your nobility.

499
00:57:29,395 --> 00:57:31,304
Hurts, doesn't it?

500
00:57:43,533 --> 00:57:46,487
In 200 metres, bear left.

501
00:57:48,955 --> 00:57:51,826
In 150 metres, bear left.

502
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:53,661
In one...

503
00:57:57,255 --> 00:57:58,500
Well done.

504
00:58:00,133 --> 00:58:04,379
- How will we know where to go?
- Maybe we should just bear left.

505
00:58:04,470 --> 00:58:08,088
People have been finding their way
for years without fucking computers.

506
00:58:08,182 --> 00:58:11,302
There is no equal to a map
and a bit of nous.

507
00:58:11,393 --> 00:58:13,884
- How are we doing back there?
- I'm almost done.

508
00:58:13,979 --> 00:58:16,137
Just gotta check the frequency.

509
00:58:16,607 --> 00:58:20,355
If this briefcase moves so much
as an inch, we're gonna know about it.

510
00:58:20,444 --> 00:58:22,235
Well, that's reassuring.

511
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:25,855
I may as well wipe my arse on that money
if we can't find the girl.

512
00:58:57,354 --> 00:58:58,682
OK.

513
00:59:00,190 --> 00:59:02,182
OK, Anna, I'm gonna need you
to lean back.

514
00:59:03,526 --> 00:59:04,902
Just take a step.

515
00:59:04,986 --> 00:59:07,192
It's OK, sweetheart.
Just, just lean back.

516
00:59:10,491 --> 00:59:14,026
You gotta trust me. It's OK, I promise.
Just take a step back and lean...

517
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:15,947
No, Alison. Alison.

518
00:59:16,038 --> 00:59:19,407
Jesus Christ, Anna!
There's no other way down!

519
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:22,835
OK.

520
00:59:26,048 --> 00:59:29,168
Look at me. Look at me. I've got you.

521
00:59:30,552 --> 00:59:32,545
You have to trust me, sweetheart.

522
00:59:33,221 --> 00:59:34,466
OK?

523
00:59:34,556 --> 00:59:38,055
Put your shoulders back. Lean back.

524
00:59:38,143 --> 00:59:40,100
There you go.

525
00:59:40,186 --> 00:59:43,306
Good girl. Good girl.

526
00:59:49,987 --> 00:59:52,988
- It's OK, Anna. Keep coming.

527
00:59:53,074 --> 00:59:55,315
Oops. Keep coming. Steady, steady.

528
01:00:02,166 --> 01:00:06,033
OK. Alright. I've got you. I've got you.

529
01:00:32,695 --> 01:00:36,609
- This is no time for a rest. Let's go.
- Just give me a moment, please.

530
01:00:36,699 --> 01:00:39,154
If Alex made it, he'd have
called the police.

531
01:00:41,412 --> 01:00:43,285
They could already be looking for us.

532
01:00:44,164 --> 01:00:45,742
You heard the shots, Alison.

533
01:00:47,167 --> 01:00:48,745
He's dead.

534
01:00:53,048 --> 01:00:54,672
Let's go. Get up.

535
01:00:55,216 --> 01:00:56,675
Get up!

536
01:00:58,178 --> 01:00:59,672
Leave me here.

537
01:01:01,639 --> 01:01:04,011
I'm slowing you down as it is.
Just leave me here.

538
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:06,176
- You don't want that.
- I've broken my leg.

539
01:01:06,269 --> 01:01:09,435
- What more do you want?
- It's not broken. You're walking on it.

540
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:16,684
- What if we've done the wrong thing?
- What do you mean?

541
01:01:21,533 --> 01:01:24,107
Maybe we should have left her there.

542
01:01:24,202 --> 01:01:27,618
- What?
- Hear me out. Please.

543
01:01:27,706 --> 01:01:29,497
Please listen to me.

544
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:31,875
Why was she even there?

545
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:34,830
Why in Scotland? She clearly
sounds Eastern European.

546
01:01:34,921 --> 01:01:37,079
I don't know, Ed.
I don't know. You tell me.

547
01:01:37,173 --> 01:01:40,257
Maybe she was kidnapped.
She's still in her school uniform.

548
01:01:40,343 --> 01:01:43,130
She was probably snatched
right outside the school.

549
01:01:43,221 --> 01:01:46,138
Kidnappers usually demand a ransom,
don't they?

550
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:52,219
In which case there's probably
another party involved, police.

551
01:01:53,022 --> 01:01:56,521
And what if we've come along
and trampled on a delicate situation?

552
01:01:57,234 --> 01:02:00,318
We might have blown her chances
of a safe handover.

553
01:02:01,154 --> 01:02:02,697
What if we've killed her?

554
01:02:03,323 --> 01:02:05,446
What if this is all our fault?

555
01:02:05,534 --> 01:02:07,526
- Look at her.
- I'm just...

556
01:02:07,619 --> 01:02:09,196
Just fucking look at her.

557
01:02:10,455 --> 01:02:14,369
Could you leave her in the ground?
Could you?

558
01:02:16,252 --> 01:02:17,283
No.

559
01:02:18,963 --> 01:02:20,374
Then there's your answer.

560
01:02:22,383 --> 01:02:25,668
Did her family do this to her?
Was she kidnapped? I don't know.

561
01:02:25,761 --> 01:02:28,632
And you don't know.
But if we've done the wrong thing,

562
01:02:28,722 --> 01:02:32,471
then I'll fucking live with it.
Now get up! Find a way.

563
01:02:35,938 --> 01:02:37,895
They'll be heading up to Annan Mor.

564
01:02:38,565 --> 01:02:41,899
And here we are, empty fucking handed.

565
01:02:43,236 --> 01:02:46,486
Look, you remember that Japanese kid
last winter? Remember him?

566
01:02:46,573 --> 01:02:48,861
Rats crawled through the pipe,
ate him alive.

567
01:02:48,950 --> 01:02:51,488
- What about him?
- Parents still paid up.

568
01:02:51,578 --> 01:02:55,705
Bluffed our way out of that. Maybe
we can't bluff our way out of this.

569
01:02:56,958 --> 01:03:00,492
You do it your way. I'll try mine.

570
01:03:11,972 --> 01:03:14,380
You're probably wondering

571
01:03:14,474 --> 01:03:16,384
why your daughter has not come home.

572
01:03:16,476 --> 01:03:19,928
We have dug a hole,
four feet by three. She's down there.

573
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:24,357
She has enough water for a week,
maybe less. She has no food.

574
01:03:24,442 --> 01:03:26,399
There's no chance you can find her.

575
01:03:26,486 --> 01:03:30,484
Her location is as remote
as it is inaccessible.

576
01:03:30,573 --> 01:03:31,818
You're being watched.

577
01:03:31,908 --> 01:03:35,111
If you try and contact the police,
we will leave her where she is.

578
01:03:35,203 --> 01:03:38,868
She will die there. In the dark. Alone.

579
01:03:38,956 --> 01:03:41,114
You will never find her body.

580
01:03:41,208 --> 01:03:44,209
We want money. Six million euros.

581
01:03:44,295 --> 01:03:49,122
Clean, non-sequential. No marked money,
transponders or dye packs.

582
01:03:49,216 --> 01:03:52,170
More instructions regarding
the hand-off will follow.

583
01:03:52,261 --> 01:03:53,920
Stay by the phone.

584
01:03:55,639 --> 01:03:56,718
Who taped the call?

585
01:03:57,474 --> 01:04:02,551
My employer records everything.
That includes his ex-wife's telephone.

586
01:04:03,354 --> 01:04:05,976
Well, these bastards aren't stupid,
are they?

587
01:04:06,107 --> 01:04:10,021
If you call the police and they get
nicked, they just gotta deny everything.

588
01:04:10,153 --> 01:04:13,319
Since the girl's in the ground,
there's no connection to us.

589
01:04:13,406 --> 01:04:14,816
She dies about the same time

590
01:04:14,907 --> 01:04:17,528
that the police release them
due to lack of evidence.

591
01:04:17,618 --> 01:04:19,776
There's no body, no murder investigation.

592
01:04:19,870 --> 01:04:22,326
That is about as sweet a hustle
as I've ever seen.

593
01:04:22,414 --> 01:04:25,783
The only time they expose themselves
is at the hand-off.

594
01:04:27,294 --> 01:04:29,619
Do you know where the pub is?

595
01:04:29,713 --> 01:04:32,548
It's not a big village. I'll find it.

596
01:04:32,632 --> 01:04:35,123
When you get there, you grab
a table by the window.

597
01:04:35,218 --> 01:04:37,970
If you can't find one,
you stand by the bar and you wait.

598
01:04:38,054 --> 01:04:40,379
No one will approach you
until you sit down.

599
01:04:40,473 --> 01:04:42,513
Don't try and guess who it's gonna be.

600
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:45,270
Think about nothing except that table.
Understand?

601
01:04:45,353 --> 01:04:46,468
Yeah.

602
01:04:48,356 --> 01:04:51,772
Don't look too confident.
Don't look too nervous either.

603
01:04:51,859 --> 01:04:55,726
You find a middle ground. You let 'em
know that it's strictly business.

604
01:04:55,821 --> 01:04:59,272
If they've got the girl,
they're gonna get paid.

605
01:04:59,366 --> 01:05:02,237
- Let's hope they bring her.
- They will. They have to.

606
01:05:02,327 --> 01:05:06,277
They'll keep her out of sight until they
see the money. That's where you come in.

607
01:05:06,373 --> 01:05:09,658
You demand to see her
before you hand it over.

608
01:05:09,751 --> 01:05:12,503
If they can get away without making
a trade, they will.

609
01:05:12,587 --> 01:05:16,455
Leaving a body behind is a lot easier
than making a full exchange.

610
01:05:16,549 --> 01:05:21,507
No one makes a move until we see
the girl. If I return without her...

611
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:27,391
Have you met her father?

612
01:05:27,477 --> 01:05:30,228
I've heard of him by reputation.

613
01:05:36,110 --> 01:05:39,111
- So you know that...
- He's got a pretty bad reputation.

614
01:05:40,030 --> 01:05:45,071
Have a jolly up in Kosovo, did he?
Little bit of an ethnic spring clean?

615
01:05:45,994 --> 01:05:49,493
Same as the rest of the Serbian wankers
that we slotted back in '99.

616
01:05:49,581 --> 01:05:53,994
So trust me, yes, I know who
I'm dealing with.

617
01:05:54,085 --> 01:05:55,959
Really?

618
01:05:56,045 --> 01:05:59,580
When we make our move,
it's gonna be quick and loud.

619
01:05:59,674 --> 01:06:03,588
Throw yourself on the floor cos he's
gonna go like fucking Christian Bale.

620
01:06:03,678 --> 01:06:06,169
Stay down till me or him picks you up.

621
01:06:06,264 --> 01:06:09,964
All I care about is the girl.
We get her safe and quick.

622
01:06:10,059 --> 01:06:11,683
Then we worry about her captors.

623
01:06:11,769 --> 01:06:14,639
Your employers, they wanna
keep 'em alive?

624
01:06:14,730 --> 01:06:17,303
- If possible.
- We'll see.

625
01:06:19,776 --> 01:06:23,145
No shotguns. I can't risk you
hitting the girl.

626
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:25,568
It's loaded with solid shot, no spread.

627
01:06:27,367 --> 01:06:30,818
We're English, Darko.
We leave friendly fire to the Yanks.

628
01:06:36,376 --> 01:06:38,000
Hey!

629
01:06:39,587 --> 01:06:41,710
Hey. Hey.

630
01:07:53,825 --> 01:07:56,113
Hi. We, erm... We need to...

631
01:07:56,202 --> 01:07:58,775
We need to report a kidnapping
and three murders.

632
01:08:38,659 --> 01:08:40,984
We'll get you up to Inverness
as quick as we can.

633
01:08:41,078 --> 01:08:44,079
Constable Stewart will drive you.
He shouldn't be a minute.

634
01:08:44,164 --> 01:08:47,165
They can take your statements,
give you medical attention.

635
01:08:47,251 --> 01:08:51,248
I'll be just past the kitchen.
So don't worry, I'm not going anywhere.

636
01:08:51,338 --> 01:08:53,793
- You said kitchen.
- Aye.

637
01:08:53,882 --> 01:08:56,005
She could do with something to eat.

638
01:09:13,651 --> 01:09:16,438
- I can't get through to Inverness.
- Why not?

639
01:09:16,529 --> 01:09:18,984
It's a big country.
It all needs policing.

640
01:09:19,073 --> 01:09:21,279
So call another station.

641
01:09:21,408 --> 01:09:25,737
I've left a message. I'm sure the desk
sergeant will call back in a minute.

642
01:09:26,747 --> 01:09:30,994
Chocolate cake. My wife's recipe.
I think you might just love it.

643
01:09:50,478 --> 01:09:51,723
You Darko?

644
01:09:53,314 --> 01:09:54,891
Yes.

645
01:09:56,066 --> 01:09:57,940
You got something for me?

646
01:09:58,902 --> 01:10:01,737
- That depends.
- Does it?

647
01:10:03,073 --> 01:10:06,157
I've got the more valuable
merchandise. What have you got?

648
01:10:07,494 --> 01:10:08,692
Money?

649
01:10:11,790 --> 01:10:15,289
There'll always be money in the world,
mate. Plenty of that to go round.

650
01:10:15,377 --> 01:10:19,326
But this little girl? Unique.

651
01:10:20,673 --> 01:10:22,333
One of a kind.

652
01:10:23,718 --> 01:10:27,550
- What are you trying to say?
- That we do things my way.

653
01:10:31,767 --> 01:10:33,926
You brought the money?

654
01:10:36,188 --> 01:10:37,351
Yeah.

655
01:10:39,566 --> 01:10:42,271
Then this is how we're gonna do it.

656
01:10:42,361 --> 01:10:45,397
I leave here now with the case
and check it with my associates.

657
01:10:45,530 --> 01:10:47,689
All being well and good,

658
01:10:47,783 --> 01:10:52,575
you'll receive a call telling you
where you can find the girl.

659
01:10:56,958 --> 01:10:58,286
No.

660
01:11:02,505 --> 01:11:05,838
- Then I'm gonna leave.
- Go?

661
01:11:05,925 --> 01:11:08,594
You sure?

662
01:11:08,677 --> 01:11:12,093
You're not gonna walk out of here
empty handed

663
01:11:12,181 --> 01:11:14,506
without listening to what I have to say.

664
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:19,724
- I wouldn't fucking bet on that, mate.
- I stake six million euros on it.

665
01:11:23,316 --> 01:11:25,356
That's what you've got in the case?

666
01:11:25,443 --> 01:11:30,189
We both know only fools fill cases
with counterfeit money,

667
01:11:30,281 --> 01:11:35,868
fools who don't care to see
their children again. I'm no fool.

668
01:11:37,330 --> 01:11:41,659
I'm glad to hear it. Because the same
thing happened to me a few years back.

669
01:11:43,711 --> 01:11:46,581
I took a boy from his family
in Marseilles.

670
01:11:48,632 --> 01:11:51,384
Well, it was a long negotiation
to say the least.

671
01:11:51,468 --> 01:11:54,173
Went on for so long I made a mistake.

672
01:11:58,475 --> 01:11:59,934
I bonded with the boy.

673
01:12:01,478 --> 01:12:03,221
We became close.

674
01:12:07,359 --> 01:12:11,023
He kept saying he wanted to come
and visit me when it was all over.

675
01:12:18,035 --> 01:12:21,950
His parents decided to hand off
a bag full of shredded newspaper.

676
01:12:22,039 --> 01:12:25,206
Police thought they were gonna catch us
during the drop-off.

677
01:12:27,086 --> 01:12:28,663
Oh, no.

678
01:12:33,091 --> 01:12:36,176
I took the boy out in the garden
to play a game of football.

679
01:12:36,261 --> 01:12:38,633
I remember because he went in goal.

680
01:12:39,931 --> 01:12:43,632
When he bent down to pick up the ball,
I shot him in the back of the head.

681
01:12:44,978 --> 01:12:47,469
Quick. Painless.

682
01:12:49,357 --> 01:12:51,184
Least I could do.

683
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:55,938
I buried him somewhere
in the southwest of France.

684
01:12:58,949 --> 01:13:01,820
Parents are still looking for him,
last I heard.

685
01:13:04,246 --> 01:13:05,575
Well done.

686
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:11,415
Like I said, I'm no fool.

687
01:13:13,046 --> 01:13:14,540
Good.

688
01:13:15,715 --> 01:13:17,957
Because that's a true story.

689
01:13:28,394 --> 01:13:31,265
You see? Nothing to worry about.

690
01:13:32,315 --> 01:13:35,434
- Anyone fancy a cup of tea?
- Tea?

691
01:13:35,526 --> 01:13:38,017
Aye. Nothing like a brew
to set you straight.

692
01:13:38,112 --> 01:13:42,441
No. No, I don't reckon
a brew's gonna do it this time.

693
01:13:42,533 --> 01:13:45,284
You said you were gonna
get us to Inverness.

694
01:13:45,369 --> 01:13:47,776
We wanna get out of here
as quickly as possible.

695
01:13:49,498 --> 01:13:51,490
Understood.

696
01:13:51,625 --> 01:13:54,875
Let me just get on to PC Stewart
and we'll see where he's got to.

697
01:14:02,260 --> 01:14:05,545
- You don't have to be so rude.
- Fuck rude! People are dead.

698
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:08,716
I wanna get out of this village,
out of this fucking country.

699
01:14:08,808 --> 01:14:11,014
And we will. Relax. We're safe now.

700
01:14:11,102 --> 01:14:14,435
How long's he gonna take?
And where's this other officer?

701
01:14:14,522 --> 01:14:16,431
Sure I can't tempt anyone with a cuppa?

702
01:14:16,524 --> 01:14:19,145
We were supposed to be in a police car
15 minutes ago.

703
01:14:19,235 --> 01:14:21,393
No, thanks! You're being paranoid.

704
01:14:21,487 --> 01:14:24,772
Well, did you actually see him
call for help? Did you hear it?

705
01:14:24,865 --> 01:14:28,150
- Why haven't they returned his call?
- It's only been ten minutes.

706
01:14:28,243 --> 01:14:30,485
A lot can happen in ten minutes, Alison.

707
01:14:31,371 --> 01:14:35,238
Are you ready to trust someone we've
just met after what we've been through?

708
01:14:36,084 --> 01:14:39,916
What if he's keeping us busy while he
waits for his mates to finish us off?

709
01:14:45,426 --> 01:14:47,004
Shit!

710
01:14:50,056 --> 01:14:51,550
- What do we do?
- We should go.

711
01:14:52,767 --> 01:14:56,930
- Let's wait five minutes, see if...
- How much longer do you wanna wait for?

712
01:14:57,021 --> 01:14:59,393
Even if he's not in on it,
what good's he gonna do?

713
01:14:59,481 --> 01:15:03,313
What can he protect us from? He's a fat
man with a badge armed with a biro.

714
01:15:03,402 --> 01:15:06,486
No, I say we leave now.
We take our chances in the crowd.

715
01:15:10,408 --> 01:15:11,653
OK.

716
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:14,530
Anna, we're just gonna go for a walk,
sweetheart.

717
01:15:17,332 --> 01:15:20,083
What's going on? Where are you going?

718
01:15:20,168 --> 01:15:21,330
We're just...

719
01:15:21,419 --> 01:15:23,210
- We're leaving.
- It's not safe.

720
01:15:23,296 --> 01:15:25,869
- Well, we're going.
- Absolutely not.

721
01:15:25,965 --> 01:15:29,049
You're my responsibility.
I'm not letting you out of my sight.

722
01:15:29,135 --> 01:15:31,507
You can't keep us here.
If we wanna go, we'll go.

723
01:15:31,595 --> 01:15:35,463
You want to walk out of here? Fine.
But I can't let you take the girl.

724
01:15:36,892 --> 01:15:39,893
I mean it. You leave,
you leave without her.

725
01:15:40,479 --> 01:15:41,937
Ed!

726
01:15:42,689 --> 01:15:46,105
- Don't come any closer.
- Easy, lad, easy.

727
01:15:46,193 --> 01:15:49,146
Don't do something
you'll have to pay for later.

728
01:15:49,237 --> 01:15:54,148
Put the knife down. Right now.

729
01:15:55,326 --> 01:15:57,366
What the...

730
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,115
Get down!

731
01:16:13,761 --> 01:16:16,168
Stay low, stay low. Keep down.

732
01:16:30,110 --> 01:16:32,019
PC Stewart. Come in, over.

733
01:16:32,946 --> 01:16:38,485
Shots fired. I'm under
attack. I need you back at the station.

734
01:16:46,250 --> 01:16:48,041
Get back against the wall!

735
01:16:48,127 --> 01:16:52,788
- Hey, hey. Is there a back door?
- Yes. You'll need keys.

736
01:16:52,881 --> 01:16:54,506
- Where?

737
01:17:00,555 --> 01:17:02,014
Follow me.

738
01:17:02,974 --> 01:17:04,766
Down! Get down!

739
01:17:14,068 --> 01:17:15,527
Anna, quick.

740
01:18:00,613 --> 01:18:03,697
Now what we have here
is a situation based on trust.

741
01:18:03,782 --> 01:18:06,534
I trust you when you say
that you've brought the money.

742
01:18:08,162 --> 01:18:12,788
And you have to trust me when I say
the girl is safe and somewhere nearby.

743
01:18:14,376 --> 01:18:16,499
I can't even walk into to a newsagent

744
01:18:16,586 --> 01:18:19,208
and buy a pack of cigarettes on trust,
my friend.

745
01:18:19,798 --> 01:18:22,882
Now, if I can't do that,

746
01:18:22,967 --> 01:18:26,052
how do you expect me to let
a man like you

747
01:18:26,137 --> 01:18:30,846
walk out of here with a fucking
retirement plan in a briefcase? Hmm?

748
01:18:33,978 --> 01:18:35,638
Man like me?

749
01:18:35,730 --> 01:18:38,565
A kidnapper and a child murderer, yes.

750
01:18:40,484 --> 01:18:41,943
That's a bit personal.

751
01:18:43,779 --> 01:18:48,322
You're a grown man, you can take it.
And this is business.

752
01:18:49,618 --> 01:18:51,694
Like the man in the newsagent.

753
01:18:54,456 --> 01:18:57,741
I hand him the money because I can
see what I'm buying.

754
01:18:57,834 --> 01:19:01,250
It even comes with a government
health warning.

755
01:19:01,337 --> 01:19:06,924
He gives me what I want
and we both walk away happy.

756
01:19:07,009 --> 01:19:08,753
So, no.

757
01:19:10,972 --> 01:19:13,011
This is not based on trust.

758
01:19:14,058 --> 01:19:17,059
This is based on what I can see
in front of me.

759
01:19:21,648 --> 01:19:23,807
And you're getting nothing...

760
01:19:25,652 --> 01:19:28,060
...until I see the girl. Nothing.

761
01:19:37,205 --> 01:19:38,829
He's got a gun! Run!

762
01:19:55,180 --> 01:19:56,675
Hurry, hurry.

763
01:19:57,349 --> 01:19:58,760
Fuck!

764
01:20:45,645 --> 01:20:49,429
They don't have the girl.
They don't have the girl!

765
01:20:52,443 --> 01:20:53,819
They've lost the girl.

766
01:20:53,903 --> 01:20:55,528
It's a bluff.

767
01:21:41,449 --> 01:21:42,991
Where are you?

768
01:21:55,754 --> 01:21:57,332
Hey, hey, I love you.

769
01:22:15,356 --> 01:22:17,016
How am I doing, mate?

770
01:22:21,237 --> 01:22:25,317
Never mind the bollocks.
Give it me straight.

771
01:22:28,035 --> 01:22:31,902
It's gone straight through the vest
and made a wreck of you. You're dying.

772
01:22:32,789 --> 01:22:35,660
You don't have long
and there's nothing I can do.

773
01:22:36,668 --> 01:22:37,783
Just bad luck, mate.

774
01:22:43,550 --> 01:22:44,748
Gun.

775
01:22:46,052 --> 01:22:47,676
Gun.

776
01:23:27,133 --> 01:23:29,256
Hey! What's going on?

777
01:23:44,274 --> 01:23:45,437
Get down!

778
01:24:23,145 --> 01:24:26,146
You should have just given us the girl!

779
01:24:31,778 --> 01:24:34,648
Where has your compassion
gotten you today?

780
01:24:44,290 --> 01:24:45,998
You fucking bitch!

781
01:25:57,568 --> 01:25:59,027
Hello again.

782
01:28:32,216 --> 01:28:34,339
Darko, you're a man of your word.

783
01:29:31,815 --> 01:29:33,523
It's OK.

784
01:29:38,780 --> 01:29:42,065
It's OK, Anna. It's OK.

785
01:29:45,119 --> 01:29:46,946
It's OK.

786
01:30:23,531 --> 01:30:27,742
- What the hell is this?
- This is her father. Now you get paid.

787
01:30:27,826 --> 01:30:29,819
If this starts to feel like an ambush,

788
01:30:29,912 --> 01:30:32,450
I will take the top
of your fucking head off.

789
01:30:33,332 --> 01:30:36,701
- Just so we're clear.
- Stay in the car until I call for you.

790
01:30:36,793 --> 01:30:39,794
- Let me do the talking.
- Don't talk yourself out of a life.

791
01:30:39,880 --> 01:30:41,504
My employer is a businessman.

792
01:30:42,549 --> 01:30:44,755
Last I heard, he was a fucking
war criminal.

793
01:30:44,843 --> 01:30:46,385
Nice.

794
01:31:47,861 --> 01:31:49,901
500,000.

795
01:31:50,822 --> 01:31:52,862
I can get it for you in an hour.

796
01:31:56,328 --> 01:31:57,656
No?

797
01:31:59,539 --> 01:32:01,697
It was worth a try.

798
01:32:02,709 --> 01:32:06,208
My daughter must have looked like
a good payday to you.

799
01:32:06,296 --> 01:32:08,418
Divorce has made my ex-wife rich.

800
01:32:08,506 --> 01:32:10,629
There is very little she could not afford.

801
01:32:11,342 --> 01:32:15,340
But behind every woman with money
is a man with deep pockets.

802
01:32:15,429 --> 01:32:18,596
You should have concerned yourself
with how he lined them.

803
01:32:20,476 --> 01:32:22,552
Strip that piece of shit.

804
01:32:38,118 --> 01:32:40,609
Darko tells me you lost a man.

805
01:32:41,079 --> 01:32:42,454
That's right.

806
01:32:43,248 --> 01:32:47,909
Don't cry too hard.
Now you won't have to split your fee.

807
01:32:49,420 --> 01:32:51,294
My daughter is safe.

808
01:32:52,131 --> 01:32:54,289
I am in debt to you.

809
01:32:55,050 --> 01:32:57,173
There's a way to fix that.

810
01:32:59,096 --> 01:33:01,219
Your account has already been credited.

811
01:33:02,891 --> 01:33:06,723
You can keep the car. A parting gift.

812
01:33:19,782 --> 01:33:23,198
Put him in the ground. Prepare my tools.

813
01:34:17,546 --> 01:34:19,669
Do you understand what she said?

814
01:34:21,925 --> 01:34:24,297
I think she said "thank you".

815
01:34:40,151 --> 01:34:42,227
Are you alright, sweetheart?

816
01:34:46,782 --> 01:34:47,945
Yeah.
