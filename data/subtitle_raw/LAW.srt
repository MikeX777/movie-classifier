1
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:22,965
Who is that? Who?

2
00:06:07,236 --> 00:06:10,656
Who are you? Who are you?

3
00:06:11,436 --> 00:06:12,818
Who are you?

4
00:06:14,421 --> 00:06:16,280
Who are you?

5
00:06:22,761 --> 00:06:24,426
Ghost! Ghost!

6
00:06:29,237 --> 00:06:33,435
Ghost! Ghost! Ghost! Ghost! Ghost!

7
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,495
Tell me buddy, how was my performance?

8
00:06:45,435 --> 00:06:46,685
You were awesome buddy!

9
00:06:46,852 --> 00:06:49,961
The watchman got so
scared he fled the scene.

10
00:06:50,922 --> 00:06:54,045
For the next two or three
months no man will work..

11
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:55,116
..here as the watchman!

12
00:06:55,196 --> 00:06:56,318
Cheers!

13
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,448
Don't be tensed. Cool!

14
00:08:27,881 --> 00:08:29,417
Take, your tension will disappear!

15
00:08:38,189 --> 00:08:45,250
Shivani, your father's people
can't find out our whereabouts.

16
00:09:43,322 --> 00:09:44,341
Let's go!

17
00:10:10,947 --> 00:10:11,893
Don't get scared.

18
00:11:26,233 --> 00:11:30,168
Such a house in this big forest!

19
00:11:31,302 --> 00:11:33,490
Moreover, the bed is arranged?

20
00:11:37,654 --> 00:11:39,090
You stay here!

21
00:11:42,427 --> 00:11:48,253
Thrishul!
Thrishul! Thrishul! Thrishul!

22
00:11:49,082 --> 00:11:52,610
Open the door thrishul!

23
00:11:53,938 --> 00:11:55,101
Thrishul!

24
00:11:55,717 --> 00:11:57,294
Please open the door.

25
00:12:03,238 --> 00:12:05,279
Please open the door, please!

26
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:11,367
Thrishul! Please. Thrishul! Thrishul!

27
00:12:15,878 --> 00:12:18,023
How is our first night surprise?

28
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:26,074
Cool, Cool! First night has to
be thrilling, at least a bit Shivani!

29
00:12:26,272 --> 00:12:28,755
Future lovers should
talk about our love chasing..

30
00:12:28,835 --> 00:12:32,949
..marriage, this first-night
set-up as if it were a horror story.

31
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:40,060
You think it's funny! I almost died..

32
00:12:41,378 --> 00:12:42,987
Don't ever say that again.

33
00:13:04,929 --> 00:13:10,118
Thrishul, which one is
greater love or admiration?

34
00:13:10,198 --> 00:13:11,960
That love which is full
of admiration is greatest!

35
00:13:12,887 --> 00:13:16,769
So, do you love me or admire me?

36
00:13:16,849 --> 00:13:20,186
I admire you lovingly!

37
00:13:29,154 --> 00:13:34,274
It's my great fortune that
I found you, who love and admire me.

38
00:13:34,554 --> 00:13:35,868
I'm very lucky!

39
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:39,171
I'm very happy! I love you so much!

40
00:13:46,439 --> 00:13:49,007
I'll take birth again
and again to be with you.

41
00:13:49,687 --> 00:13:51,146
But for now, enough of you!

42
00:14:23,883 --> 00:14:25,113
Oh, he killed her!

43
00:14:25,193 --> 00:14:27,706
So, you are upset because of that?
This is a movie, baby!

44
00:14:27,786 --> 00:14:29,941
You shouldn't take
is seriously and get upset!

45
00:14:30,021 --> 00:14:31,315
Take it easy dear.

46
00:14:33,674 --> 00:14:37,334
Isn't it sin to cheat people
about love and kill them?

47
00:14:37,504 --> 00:14:40,618
My dear, we do know that
when you get connected to..

48
00:14:40,698 --> 00:14:43,033
..something you are easily affected.

49
00:14:43,113 --> 00:14:44,333
But please change
your facial expressions..

50
00:14:44,413 --> 00:14:46,041
..so that we all can go out, okay?

51
00:14:51,112 --> 00:14:52,080
What happened dear?

52
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,348
He has put his leg on the way!

53
00:14:54,783 --> 00:14:56,914
We don't want trouble,
let's go by the other side!

54
00:15:01,457 --> 00:15:02,351
See this yaar!

55
00:15:05,552 --> 00:15:07,611
These kind of people
don't understand words.

56
00:15:07,994 --> 00:15:10,026
Is she going to use pepper spray?

57
00:15:10,106 --> 00:15:12,257
These days that's the trend.
Its better we..

58
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:23,048
There's no signal in my phone, dear!

59
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:27,846
What, no signals there? Use my phone!

60
00:15:29,196 --> 00:15:30,737
Why should we waste
a call for you guys!

61
00:15:30,817 --> 00:15:31,751
Is there message balance?

62
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:32,805
Hundred messages are free.

63
00:15:32,885 --> 00:15:34,705
I don't need so many.
One message is enough!

64
00:16:06,969 --> 00:16:11,560
If you see girls alone,
you start teasing them?

65
00:16:12,617 --> 00:16:14,626
I'm going to break every ones..

66
00:16:14,793 --> 00:16:17,450
Break what?
What? What are you going to break?

67
00:16:17,621 --> 00:16:20,229
What are you seeing?
What are you going to do? Get lost!

68
00:18:09,109 --> 00:18:10,223
Come!

69
00:18:46,531 --> 00:18:49,776
Hey, you! We are here to frighten
people and make our livelihood!

70
00:18:50,128 --> 00:18:54,784
If you guys get frightened and
run away, how are we going to live?

71
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:57,146
It's against our culture.

72
00:18:57,547 --> 00:19:00,965
If this continues,
our species will go extinct!

73
00:19:04,236 --> 00:19:07,032
- How does he look?
- He looks exactly like a hero, brother!

74
00:19:07,492 --> 00:19:09,827
I don't know where he lives, but
I do have his number with me, brother.

75
00:19:09,907 --> 00:19:11,947
His phone number is with you?

76
00:19:12,124 --> 00:19:15,362
Anyway, we'll discuss this later.
First, call him!

77
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:20,239
It's ringing brother.

78
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,239
Hey, you!
You beat-up my boys, I believe.

79
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:30,551
Do you think you are a hero?

80
00:19:30,631 --> 00:19:33,025
What nonsense are
you talking you loser?

81
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:34,928
I have a daughter,
whose age is like a heroines' age.

82
00:19:35,353 --> 00:19:37,116
Do I look like a hero to you?

83
00:19:37,261 --> 00:19:40,874
To find out my age you have to
make a video call you foolish fellow.

84
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,201
Not a voice all! Cut the call!

85
00:19:49,092 --> 00:19:50,243
What happened, brother?

86
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:52,457
Brother!

87
00:19:58,987 --> 00:19:59,882
Who was that guy, child?

88
00:20:00,931 --> 00:20:02,025
Which guy father?

89
00:20:02,228 --> 00:20:04,026
That guy who came like
a hero and fought with goons..

90
00:20:04,106 --> 00:20:05,655
..to save you, that guy!

91
00:20:05,841 --> 00:20:07,692
I don't know him father.

92
00:20:07,862 --> 00:20:10,266
So, you say that even though
there's no relation between..

93
00:20:10,346 --> 00:20:13,785
..you both he has risked
his life to save you?

94
00:20:14,368 --> 00:20:16,967
You should not try
to fool your father!

95
00:20:23,729 --> 00:20:26,990
By the way,
who was that amazing stud who risked..

96
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,304
..everything to save me?

97
00:20:28,384 --> 00:20:29,299
He's my brother!

98
00:20:29,379 --> 00:20:31,505
I had sent him a message
asking him to come.

99
00:20:31,585 --> 00:20:33,441
- Your brother?
- Yeah!

100
00:20:33,716 --> 00:20:36,168
Then, to whom did you send
a message from that rowdy's phone?

101
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:38,035
She doesn't have a brother, for sure.

102
00:20:38,115 --> 00:20:41,220
I don't think she
even has a boyfriend.

103
00:20:42,695 --> 00:20:44,440
After everything was over,
uncle arrived, right?

104
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,874
She must have sent him the message.

105
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:50,961
I was very stressed at that time,
so I sent the message to my father.

106
00:20:51,552 --> 00:20:53,628
Your brother came
on time and saved us!

107
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:55,212
Or else I don't know
what would've happened to us!

108
00:20:55,292 --> 00:20:57,684
He's completed his training
and waiting for his joining..

109
00:20:57,764 --> 00:20:59,295
..orders, a future police man he is!

110
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:01,287
Usually police come
at the climax, right?

111
00:21:01,367 --> 00:21:03,146
How come your brother
came at the beginning?

112
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,655
He's like Shiva Mani!

113
00:21:04,735 --> 00:21:06,479
If you send a single message
saying that you have a problem

114
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:07,556
..he'll be there to handle everything!

115
00:21:07,676 --> 00:21:08,728
Is that so?

116
00:21:18,342 --> 00:21:21,016
You guys keep making fun of me because
I don't have a boyfriend, right?

117
00:21:21,332 --> 00:21:23,590
Now once your brother comes
here I'll make him fall for me!

118
00:21:23,773 --> 00:21:25,998
It's not that easy to make
my brother fall for you dear.

119
00:21:26,078 --> 00:21:27,554
He is another Shiva Mani!

120
00:21:30,881 --> 00:21:32,602
He'll not fall for any girls?

121
00:21:33,107 --> 00:21:37,575
Gabbar Singh, power star Pavan kalyan
Garu said a dialogue about women!

122
00:21:37,655 --> 00:21:40,426
Now, I'm going to tell
a dialogue about men.

123
00:21:40,506 --> 00:21:42,694
A man should fall
in love with a girl..

124
00:21:42,867 --> 00:21:45,005
..and it's for sure he's
going to fall, it's inevitable!

125
00:21:46,645 --> 00:21:49,083
He'll fall in love with a girl,
even if it takes a week..

126
00:21:49,163 --> 00:21:51,073
..or a month or even a year!

127
00:21:54,657 --> 00:21:57,432
See now, what is going to happen now!

128
00:22:09,552 --> 00:22:13,212
Our seniors are ragging
us and troubling us.

129
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:15,404
Please save me!

130
00:22:38,678 --> 00:22:40,477
Do you know how it is
when Yamini sends a message?

131
00:22:41,328 --> 00:22:43,923
Brother, we are here in
the Balaji theatre and some..

132
00:22:44,003 --> 00:22:46,560
..scoundrels are troubling
me and my friends!

133
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,276
Come soon and save us bro!

134
00:22:49,978 --> 00:22:51,424
Do you know how the message
that came just now is?

135
00:22:51,504 --> 00:22:54,364
Please brother, save me!

136
00:22:54,444 --> 00:22:56,834
In my college some of
our seniors are ragging me.

137
00:22:56,914 --> 00:22:58,764
Please come!

138
00:23:00,293 --> 00:23:03,821
When the message is so polite,
it's definitely not from my sister.

139
00:23:04,495 --> 00:23:08,169
That's why I knew there is
some twist in this and sent my friend!

140
00:23:08,633 --> 00:23:10,383
You are real police, brother!

141
00:23:13,337 --> 00:23:15,641
By the way, my name is Vikram!

142
00:23:16,264 --> 00:23:17,399
Radha!

143
00:23:42,802 --> 00:23:49,894
"Why is this so?
Why is this so? Why is this so?"

144
00:23:52,058 --> 00:23:56,531
"This guy I met is like a thunder!"

145
00:23:56,611 --> 00:23:59,061
"He is showering in my heart!"

146
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:05,768
"Something has started
which I've never seen!"

147
00:24:05,848 --> 00:24:08,253
"It's happening inside me."

148
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:12,540
"Suddenly something magical happened,
and my heart leaped in joy for it!"

149
00:24:12,691 --> 00:24:16,256
"My heart is running after
you and it says she wants you!"

150
00:24:16,336 --> 00:24:19,604
"This magic,
is it all because of you?"

151
00:24:19,684 --> 00:24:24,227
"Are you the one who is tickling me?"

152
00:24:24,307 --> 00:24:33,796
"Why is this so?
Why is this so? Why is this so?"

153
00:24:33,876 --> 00:24:37,276
"Why is this so?"

154
00:24:37,356 --> 00:24:41,835
"Why is this so?"

155
00:24:41,915 --> 00:24:45,419
"Why is this so?"

156
00:24:45,499 --> 00:24:49,681
"Why is this so?"

157
00:24:49,761 --> 00:24:54,643
"I've started liking myself so much!"

158
00:24:54,723 --> 00:24:58,781
"Thoughts of you
are making me feel shy!"

159
00:24:59,501 --> 00:25:03,902
"I can feel you inside my heart!"

160
00:25:04,141 --> 00:25:13,471
"Now a days, I'm a changed person,
this seems so magical!"

161
00:25:13,635 --> 00:25:17,614
"All this is because of you!"

162
00:25:18,176 --> 00:25:25,306
"This guy I met is like a thunder!"

163
00:25:27,167 --> 00:25:36,051
"Why is this so?
Why is this so? Why is this so?"

164
00:25:54,864 --> 00:25:59,459
"It's very difficult to
explain what is happening to me!"

165
00:25:59,539 --> 00:26:04,001
"You looked at me and
made something happen!"

166
00:26:04,191 --> 00:26:13,184
"A flood has engulfed me
and do you know what its name is?"

167
00:26:13,501 --> 00:26:22,201
"You have stolen me from myself
and now I feel I'm part of you!"

168
00:26:22,755 --> 00:26:30,037
"This guy I met is like a thunder!"

169
00:26:31,647 --> 00:26:38,695
"Why is this so?
Why is this so? Why is this so?"

170
00:26:38,775 --> 00:26:41,428
"Why is this so? "

171
00:27:22,172 --> 00:27:24,136
Two thousand rupees for two coffees?

172
00:27:27,869 --> 00:27:30,513
Is the pocket money mom and
dad are giving is not enough for you?

173
00:27:30,713 --> 00:27:32,294
Are you doing a part time job?

174
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:35,987
When you have a brother like me,
if you do these kind of..

175
00:27:36,315 --> 00:27:37,196
..jobs it's going
to be humiliating for me!

176
00:27:37,276 --> 00:27:38,617
Stop your over acting, will you?

177
00:27:38,697 --> 00:27:39,747
Are you showing off in front of her?

178
00:27:41,176 --> 00:27:42,164
Why do you speak like that?

179
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:44,373
When I called you some
time ago why did you cut my call?

180
00:27:44,661 --> 00:27:45,825
You see..

181
00:27:46,614 --> 00:27:47,921
That..

182
00:27:48,197 --> 00:27:49,788
You cut Yamini's call?

183
00:27:50,136 --> 00:27:53,418
Hello, enough of you.
You too disconnected my call!

184
00:27:58,165 --> 00:28:00,150
When father gave me some
pocket money I brought my..

185
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:02,057
..friends to this coffee
shop to treat them.

186
00:28:09,369 --> 00:28:10,560
I can't find my money.

187
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,915
Hey, server!

188
00:28:12,204 --> 00:28:14,110
Bring two plates idli,
and two plates pesarattu upma!

189
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:15,101
Okay sir.

190
00:28:18,065 --> 00:28:19,467
You have a bill in your hand..

191
00:28:20,004 --> 00:28:21,719
..and I don't have money
in my hand to clear that bill!

192
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:23,451
First thing in the morning,
I got this case!

193
00:28:23,531 --> 00:28:26,147
- Hey, Simhachalam! Simhachalam,
come here. - Yes sir.

194
00:28:26,227 --> 00:28:28,677
Take this sir inside
and make him grind the dal!

195
00:28:28,757 --> 00:28:30,215
- Sir!
- Sir!

196
00:28:30,348 --> 00:28:31,101
What?

197
00:28:31,181 --> 00:28:33,222
Same situation, Sir!

198
00:28:33,353 --> 00:28:34,154
What all did you eat?

199
00:28:34,234 --> 00:28:35,757
- Pizza!
- Burger!

200
00:28:35,837 --> 00:28:38,139
- Ice-cream!
- We even drank cool drinks, sir!

201
00:28:38,219 --> 00:28:41,630
Bearer! Take their bags and phones
and make them clean the kitchen!

202
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:42,737
Okay.

203
00:28:47,185 --> 00:28:51,300
Sir, we've cleaned the
kitchen completely. See you, sir!

204
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:55,555
When you work, we let you go.
That's the olden system.

205
00:28:55,762 --> 00:28:57,803
Punishment cum cash is the new trend!

206
00:28:57,979 --> 00:28:59,961
Call some of your
people and get the cash..

207
00:29:00,041 --> 00:29:02,595
..or else I'll make you work
like the waiter for a months' time!

208
00:29:08,633 --> 00:29:11,340
Oh, is that so? Yesterday
Seenu had asked me for some money.

209
00:29:11,993 --> 00:29:14,324
So I took the money from
your purse and gave him!

210
00:29:15,149 --> 00:29:16,754
I thought of telling you but I forgot!

211
00:29:16,834 --> 00:29:18,713
I thought it must me you!

212
00:29:18,934 --> 00:29:20,523
Yamini, I have to pay my bill.

213
00:29:20,603 --> 00:29:21,469
Go and grind the dal!

214
00:29:25,173 --> 00:29:27,271
All the money was in the purse!
What do we do now?

215
00:29:27,769 --> 00:29:28,981
I'll handle it!

216
00:29:29,308 --> 00:29:31,544
I don't know what she's going
to tell mother, I'll see you later!

217
00:29:31,624 --> 00:29:32,607
Okay.

218
00:29:46,492 --> 00:29:49,493
What baby, did you both fought again?

219
00:29:49,573 --> 00:29:52,474
Mummy, she's telling all lies.
Radha is just a friend to me!

220
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:56,902
She didn't tell anything yet.
By the way, why will she tell lies?

221
00:29:57,789 --> 00:30:00,590
We caught you! Who is that Radha?

222
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:03,097
No mummy,
Radha is just a friend to me!

223
00:30:03,177 --> 00:30:06,496
When we are hesitating to
talk about a person that means..

224
00:30:06,767 --> 00:30:08,533
..we have a relation with that one.

225
00:30:08,792 --> 00:30:10,331
Bring that Radha home once!

226
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:36,624
Mosa garu! Mosa garu! Mosa garu!

227
00:30:39,991 --> 00:30:41,678
To hell with these people!

228
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:48,440
The can't let me do even
puja in peace! Hey you Kasi, Kasi.

229
00:30:49,165 --> 00:30:51,959
- Where the hell are you?
- I'm right in front of you!

230
00:30:52,618 --> 00:30:56,218
The day I took my oath as
the president of this apartment..

231
00:30:56,298 --> 00:30:59,883
..that I'll never let the people in this
apartment suffer any kind of trouble.

232
00:30:59,963 --> 00:31:02,715
What are they going through?

233
00:31:02,795 --> 00:31:06,388
Mosa keeps his word and
never changes his attitude!

234
00:31:06,468 --> 00:31:08,819
First stop your nonsense so that
we can go there and see what happened!

235
00:31:09,762 --> 00:31:11,865
Let's go! Follow me!

236
00:31:14,937 --> 00:31:18,383
Hey, this apartment comes
under our area. Who are you?

237
00:31:20,152 --> 00:31:21,995
Who do you think am I?

238
00:31:22,122 --> 00:31:25,642
Mo stands for modern and Sa stands
for Sampradayam which means culture.

239
00:31:25,722 --> 00:31:28,355
I took mo and sa
and made my name Mosa..

240
00:31:28,435 --> 00:31:30,904
..and became the president
of this apartment!

241
00:31:31,031 --> 00:31:34,525
Don't try to challenge me.
You'll burn to ashes!

242
00:31:34,605 --> 00:31:37,537
It's not you who should say that.
Others should say that!

243
00:31:37,709 --> 00:31:42,623
I heard it, I heard your minds voice!
First send them out.

244
00:31:42,703 --> 00:31:43,991
Why should we have trouble with them?

245
00:31:44,071 --> 00:31:45,536
If we give them ten
rupees they'll go away!

246
00:31:45,616 --> 00:31:47,759
Of course!
It's not your money we give, but mine!

247
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,784
- Thanks sir!
- Okay, leave!

248
00:31:53,049 --> 00:31:55,364
Not just hearing mind voice!
You need to have a mind!

249
00:31:55,444 --> 00:31:56,807
Mr. President!

250
00:31:56,887 --> 00:31:58,862
Today these beggars
have come near our house.

251
00:31:59,014 --> 00:32:00,586
Tomorrow they may
come inside the house.

252
00:32:00,807 --> 00:32:02,441
You'll have to stop all
this as you are the president!

253
00:32:02,521 --> 00:32:04,340
What should I do, you tell me?

254
00:32:04,512 --> 00:32:06,235
Okay, I'll do this!

255
00:32:06,315 --> 00:32:08,121
I'll bring Ivanka from America!

256
00:32:08,201 --> 00:32:10,269
Then all the security
people will be here!

257
00:32:10,521 --> 00:32:11,690
Why do you talk about
what's impossible?

258
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:12,465
Do what is possible!

259
00:32:12,545 --> 00:32:15,250
You tell what you want. He'll do it!

260
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:16,673
Ayya, president garu.

261
00:32:17,729 --> 00:32:21,508
A patient without treatment
and an apartment without watchman..

262
00:32:21,588 --> 00:32:23,134
..both are not safe!

263
00:32:23,348 --> 00:32:25,597
First, appoint a watchman here, sir!

264
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:26,600
Of course, of course!

265
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,987
I've been calling those
security agency people!

266
00:32:29,067 --> 00:32:32,073
They are getting scared to
send a watchman for our apartment!

267
00:32:32,231 --> 00:32:35,338
Sir, Mr. Murali, you are
using our apartment watchman as..

268
00:32:35,418 --> 00:32:37,621
..if he is your own personal servant!

269
00:32:37,701 --> 00:32:38,920
How much did I use Sir?

270
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,217
In the morning to get
breakfast from restaurant..

271
00:32:40,297 --> 00:32:41,681
..in the afternoon to get lunch..

272
00:32:41,761 --> 00:32:44,539
..and once in a while I send
him to the market or maybe liquor.

273
00:32:44,619 --> 00:32:46,247
- That is all, isn't it?
- Sir!

274
00:32:46,501 --> 00:32:48,901
Now I understand why those
watchmen used to ruN away like that!

275
00:32:49,022 --> 00:32:51,098
Yes, of course. I understand it!

276
00:33:08,664 --> 00:33:09,655
What happened driver?

277
00:33:09,735 --> 00:33:11,310
I don't know madam! I'll check.

278
00:33:23,065 --> 00:33:24,471
Auto can't start madam.

279
00:33:24,551 --> 00:33:26,148
Some problem in the engine I guess!

280
00:33:30,821 --> 00:33:33,539
If any auto comes this side
I'll arrange it for you madam.

281
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:34,783
Okay!

282
00:33:56,276 --> 00:33:57,082
Driver!

283
00:33:57,162 --> 00:33:57,963
Madam?

284
00:34:00,088 --> 00:34:02,771
I live nearby. I can walk home.

285
00:34:02,926 --> 00:34:03,714
Okay madam.

286
00:35:27,841 --> 00:35:30,861
So, last night a shadow followed you,
that too like a ghost?

287
00:35:34,547 --> 00:35:37,863
If the shadow is a ghost either
it'll attack you or frighten you!

288
00:35:37,943 --> 00:35:39,705
But this way of following is new,
isn't it?

289
00:35:41,336 --> 00:35:43,391
Maybe that shadow loves Radha.

290
00:35:43,556 --> 00:35:45,084
Do ghosts also love?

291
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:47,330
If someone is beautiful like Radha!

292
00:35:48,786 --> 00:35:53,622
What atmas,
even pretatmas also will fall in love!

293
00:35:55,074 --> 00:35:56,989
Do you know how scared
I was last night?

294
00:35:57,859 --> 00:35:59,298
You all find it funny, do you?

295
00:35:59,436 --> 00:36:02,663
Radha! Just joking,
don't take it seriously!

296
00:36:02,791 --> 00:36:05,126
I would like to share other
people's sadness, instead of..

297
00:36:05,387 --> 00:36:06,776
..making fun of them like this!

298
00:36:53,421 --> 00:36:56,526
I don't know why, but I feel this
is the guy who followed me last night.

299
00:37:01,237 --> 00:37:03,541
You said last night it was a shadow?

300
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:05,914
I feel he was that shadow!

301
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:09,387
I feel you got scared
of that shadow a lot.

302
00:37:09,636 --> 00:37:11,027
That's why you feel so.

303
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:15,430
You stop thinking about
that shadow for a while and..

304
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:16,581
And?

305
00:37:17,399 --> 00:37:21,451
If you think about me..

306
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:26,703
Here, if anyone sees both
of us like this it won't be good.

307
00:37:26,853 --> 00:37:27,944
You go! Bye.

308
00:37:28,254 --> 00:37:29,178
Is that all?

309
00:37:31,226 --> 00:37:32,516
What else do you want?

310
00:37:37,844 --> 00:37:40,462
- I mean..
- Okay, bye!

311
00:37:41,691 --> 00:37:42,626
Radha.

312
00:37:43,512 --> 00:37:44,807
What?

313
00:37:45,083 --> 00:37:49,179
It's very difficult to tell girls about
what you have in your heart, isn't it?

314
00:37:49,259 --> 00:37:55,060
I don't know about boys, but girls
can't express themselves to guys!

315
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,372
It's very difficult.

316
00:37:57,563 --> 00:38:01,432
If we get into chatting here,
it's even more difficult. You leave!

317
00:38:01,814 --> 00:38:03,784
- Bye, you take care.
- Okay, bye!

318
00:40:01,346 --> 00:40:03,343
Hey, you! What's your problem man?

319
00:40:03,423 --> 00:40:06,026
Why are you looking at me?
Who are you, man?

320
00:40:11,271 --> 00:40:12,668
Radha, what happened?

321
00:40:12,917 --> 00:40:15,464
From a couple of days
this guy is following me.

322
00:40:15,544 --> 00:40:17,865
If we see his face
we'll get nightmares.

323
00:40:17,945 --> 00:40:19,664
- I'm going to hit him..
- Radha, wait a second.

324
00:40:19,981 --> 00:40:23,281
Hey, you! I've seen you
in front of Radhas apartment.

325
00:40:23,792 --> 00:40:25,359
Why are you following her?

326
00:40:26,068 --> 00:40:27,308
He won't budge like this.

327
00:40:27,388 --> 00:40:30,068
If we complain to police and when
they hit him, he'll learn his lesson.

328
00:40:30,423 --> 00:40:32,664
See, this is your last warning.

329
00:40:32,908 --> 00:40:35,725
If I see you again following
this girl, that's all. Go!

330
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:41,100
Get lost!

331
00:40:42,961 --> 00:40:45,217
Radha, cool!

332
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:47,429
A surprise for you!

333
00:40:51,191 --> 00:40:52,776
Radha, my mother.

334
00:40:53,168 --> 00:40:54,061
Mummy, radha!

335
00:40:54,141 --> 00:40:55,046
Namaste aunty!

336
00:40:55,316 --> 00:40:56,237
Come inside dear!

337
00:41:00,622 --> 00:41:02,517
Why didn't you tell me you
are bringing me to your house?

338
00:41:02,597 --> 00:41:04,364
I did tell you it's a surprise,
didn't I? Come!

339
00:41:12,309 --> 00:41:14,655
Yamini, see who's here!

340
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:16,737
- Hey!
- Hi!

341
00:41:17,135 --> 00:41:19,931
Dear, she is our son's friend Radha.

342
00:41:20,011 --> 00:41:21,006
Namaste uncle!

343
00:41:21,192 --> 00:41:23,074
- How are you, dear?
- I'm fine uncle.

344
00:41:23,377 --> 00:41:25,077
How are your parents?

345
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:29,312
My mother died in my childhood,
my father is everything to me.

346
00:41:29,982 --> 00:41:31,715
He is a bank manager.

347
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:33,658
You don't be worried dear.

348
00:41:34,521 --> 00:41:36,563
From today on we have two daughters!

349
00:41:37,791 --> 00:41:40,421
Vikram told us that he likes you.

350
00:41:58,547 --> 00:42:03,174
"Do you know the language
in which the heart communicates?

351
00:42:03,254 --> 00:42:07,934
"Have you heard the music of my heart
which is trying to tell you something?"

352
00:42:08,014 --> 00:42:12,647
"Do you know the language
in which the heart communicates?

353
00:42:12,727 --> 00:42:17,239
"Have you heard the music of my heart
which is trying to tell you something?"

354
00:42:17,319 --> 00:42:24,357
"Have you spoken something?
Have I heard something?"

355
00:42:24,437 --> 00:42:28,856
"Let's lock and tie
a knot to unite us.."

356
00:42:28,936 --> 00:42:33,053
"..which can put an end to
all the wars waging in our hearts."

357
00:42:33,511 --> 00:42:35,974
"I think I'll say no!"

358
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:40,534
"Do you know the language
in which the heart communicates?

359
00:42:40,614 --> 00:42:46,347
"Have you heard the music of my heart
which is trying to tell you something?"

360
00:43:03,857 --> 00:43:13,190
"Can't you understand how impatient your
soul is to shower me with affection?"

361
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:17,988
"Ask your breath and eyes
which are inviting me to fill.."

362
00:43:18,068 --> 00:43:21,897
"..you with signs of endearment."

363
00:43:22,604 --> 00:43:30,713
"The steps I take are leading
me to shower you with kisses."

364
00:43:30,793 --> 00:43:38,743
"This is very true!
Is it the time yet?"

365
00:43:38,823 --> 00:43:41,189
"Should we wait even more?"

366
00:43:41,269 --> 00:43:45,727
"Do you know the language
in which the heart communicates?

367
00:43:45,807 --> 00:43:50,711
"Have you heard the music of my heart
which is trying to tell you something?"

368
00:44:09,186 --> 00:44:17,035
"The sky showers the earth
with kisses of rain drops."

369
00:44:18,539 --> 00:44:23,097
"The waves of the sea have
been waiting to meet their.."

370
00:44:23,177 --> 00:44:26,358
"..destination all this while."

371
00:44:27,758 --> 00:44:32,471
"The flowers have a display
of affection with the air.."

372
00:44:32,551 --> 00:44:35,923
"..surrounding them."

373
00:44:36,003 --> 00:44:43,870
"I want you to accept
the offering of my affection."

374
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:46,413
"Isn't this love eternal?"

375
00:44:46,493 --> 00:44:50,902
"Do you know the language
in which the heart communicates?

376
00:44:51,075 --> 00:44:55,710
"Have you heard the music of my heart
which is trying to tell you something?"

377
00:44:55,790 --> 00:45:00,301
"Do you know the language
in which the heart communicates?

378
00:45:00,381 --> 00:45:06,320
"Have you heard the music of my heart
which is trying to tell you something?"

379
00:45:10,853 --> 00:45:13,406
What darling, these days
you don't come over to my place?

380
00:45:13,486 --> 00:45:16,693
A new chick has come,
and her touch is electrifying, is it?

381
00:45:16,773 --> 00:45:18,167
Yes, darling!

382
00:45:18,541 --> 00:45:19,966
I wish to come over.

383
00:45:20,046 --> 00:45:22,200
But these days my superior
is stressing me so much that I..

384
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:24,552
..can't perform well anymore!

385
00:45:25,169 --> 00:45:29,369
Whatever it is, please don't remind me
all this during my night duties, baby.

386
00:45:36,228 --> 00:45:40,442
Just a minute, I'll call you back!
Start the vehicle.

387
00:46:01,115 --> 00:46:02,663
Are you the watchman
for this apartment?

388
00:46:02,743 --> 00:46:04,194
Excuse me!

389
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:14,009
That fellow is my assistant.

390
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,132
An assistant to the watchman?

391
00:46:21,322 --> 00:46:22,125
How much is your salary?

392
00:46:22,205 --> 00:46:27,135
Sir, you are mistaken.
I'm the president of this apartment.

393
00:46:27,632 --> 00:46:28,746
Is that so?

394
00:46:32,178 --> 00:46:34,053
Aren't there any CC TV
cameras in this apartment?

395
00:46:34,482 --> 00:46:35,624
No watchman either!

396
00:46:35,704 --> 00:46:39,747
Watchman has gone to ooty, and
CC cameras I've ordered from America.

397
00:46:39,827 --> 00:46:41,469
They are on the way!

398
00:46:41,549 --> 00:46:43,365
CC cameras from USA, is it?

399
00:46:43,572 --> 00:46:45,302
And watchman comes from ooty?

400
00:46:46,055 --> 00:46:47,557
Your way of working
is as ridiculous as you are.

401
00:46:48,096 --> 00:46:50,013
Modern above and traditional below.

402
00:46:51,162 --> 00:46:54,953
I don't know what you'll do,
but I give you just two days.

403
00:46:55,217 --> 00:46:57,570
Arrange CC TV cameras to this
apartment and appoint a watchman here.

404
00:46:57,650 --> 00:46:58,719
Sure sir.

405
00:46:58,799 --> 00:47:01,203
Just now four bikes came
into this apartment, who are they?

406
00:47:01,283 --> 00:47:03,597
They are our boys.
They live in this apartment.

407
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:06,067
- Take care!
- Sure sir.

408
00:47:25,490 --> 00:47:27,621
Hey, you!
Have your ears stopped working?

409
00:47:27,701 --> 00:47:29,648
Can't you hear your phone ringing?

410
00:47:29,835 --> 00:47:32,201
Phone is ringing so loudly,
have your ears stopped working?

411
00:47:32,492 --> 00:47:34,754
You are glaring at me,
but can't attend the call?

412
00:47:38,012 --> 00:47:38,884
Hello, who is it?

413
00:47:38,964 --> 00:47:40,219
It's from the security agency.

414
00:47:40,299 --> 00:47:41,403
One minute, Sir!

415
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:43,472
The call is from the security agency.

416
00:47:43,552 --> 00:47:44,676
Give it to me.

417
00:47:47,423 --> 00:47:48,537
Go! Go, and do your work!

418
00:47:48,617 --> 00:47:49,782
That's what I do!

419
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:53,581
Hello!

420
00:47:53,661 --> 00:47:55,104
Sir, Mr. Mosa, it's me sir!

421
00:47:55,184 --> 00:47:57,761
We can talk later bro,
first tell me about the watchman!

422
00:47:57,996 --> 00:48:00,660
I've given your apartment address
to a new watchman called Rudra..

423
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:01,836
..he must be there by now!

424
00:48:01,916 --> 00:48:04,860
You are saying a new watchman,
does he know the situation here or no?

425
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:06,915
You are there to tell all that sir,
aren't you?

426
00:48:06,995 --> 00:48:09,108
Okay, okay!
I'll explain him everything.

427
00:48:09,188 --> 00:48:11,717
But send him soon dear. These
people here are stressing me a lot.

428
00:48:11,797 --> 00:48:13,370
He should be there by now, just check!

429
00:48:43,881 --> 00:48:46,494
There is a chair near the gate,
you go and sit there.

430
00:48:46,626 --> 00:48:48,408
I'll come and explain
everything to you later!

431
00:48:48,488 --> 00:48:49,983
I have a lot of work now.

432
00:49:54,873 --> 00:49:57,426
Please close the door!

433
00:50:45,857 --> 00:50:47,545
What happened?

434
00:51:37,938 --> 00:51:38,908
Watchman!

435
00:51:42,118 --> 00:51:43,456
We need to get some vegetables!

436
00:51:43,650 --> 00:51:45,417
It's okay, I'll go to get them.

437
00:52:16,891 --> 00:52:20,413
Why are you here?
Who appointed you here?

438
00:52:20,796 --> 00:52:23,594
It's too late already,
go to your flat!

439
00:52:47,223 --> 00:52:51,044
Please close the door!
Please close the door!

440
00:54:21,872 --> 00:54:24,812
I can't understand whether he
is mad or stupid and I might go mad!

441
00:54:34,733 --> 00:54:38,262
I can't understand whether he
is mad or stupid and I might go mad!

442
00:54:44,650 --> 00:54:47,642
What an auspicious day today is,
it's as if the Goddess..

443
00:54:47,722 --> 00:54:50,185
..Lakshmi Devi herself
has come to our house today.

444
00:54:51,610 --> 00:54:55,407
Why will someone like you
want to meet the president like me?

445
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:58,051
If you do something so stupid,
anyone will think of you!

446
00:54:59,470 --> 00:55:00,895
What is that stupid thing that I did?

447
00:55:00,975 --> 00:55:02,514
Why did you appoint such a watchman?

448
00:55:02,594 --> 00:55:04,908
He looks like a thief,
remove him from here immediately!

449
00:55:04,988 --> 00:55:06,175
Good my dear!

450
00:55:06,321 --> 00:55:09,752
When there was no watchman,
you all people stressed me about it.

451
00:55:10,065 --> 00:55:12,680
When I prayed to so many
deities we've found him finally.

452
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:16,321
And now you say he looks like a thief,
send him away and start stressing me?

453
00:55:16,401 --> 00:55:17,739
Have you seen his face properly?

454
00:55:17,819 --> 00:55:19,461
He looks like someone who steals hens
and chicken from the neighbourhood.

455
00:55:19,541 --> 00:55:20,699
Can't you see that?

456
00:55:21,377 --> 00:55:24,712
My dear, he is a watchman
who stays near the gate.

457
00:55:25,127 --> 00:55:28,531
He's not the son-in-law of
the family to select a handsome hunk.

458
00:55:28,718 --> 00:55:30,067
I don't care about all that, sir.

459
00:55:30,147 --> 00:55:31,299
Will you send that fellow away or not?

460
00:55:31,379 --> 00:55:32,793
There's no way I can send him away!

461
00:55:32,873 --> 00:55:37,263
Even if the sky tears
down or whatever! It's mosa!

462
00:55:37,739 --> 00:55:40,645
Mosa keeps his word and
never changes his attitude!

463
00:55:40,725 --> 00:55:42,576
You go and change your decision!

464
00:56:08,838 --> 00:56:10,404
Radha, radha!

465
00:56:13,105 --> 00:56:14,035
What happened to you?

466
00:56:14,816 --> 00:56:16,255
Why are you so absent minded?

467
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:20,799
That sweeper has come back!

468
00:56:22,532 --> 00:56:23,495
Where did you see him?

469
00:56:23,661 --> 00:56:26,135
He has come as a watchman
for our apartment!

470
00:56:32,195 --> 00:56:33,086
Come!

471
00:56:43,809 --> 00:56:46,068
I think he's not here. You leave!

472
00:56:46,148 --> 00:56:49,018
If anyone sees both of us
together here it won't be good!

473
00:56:52,599 --> 00:56:53,695
Take care!

474
00:58:02,991 --> 00:58:06,771
Please close the door!
Please close the door!

475
00:58:11,830 --> 00:58:13,732
Leave me!

476
00:58:15,574 --> 00:58:17,174
Leave me!

477
00:58:33,129 --> 00:58:37,367
Please close the door!
Please close the door!

478
00:59:18,022 --> 00:59:21,281
Am I exaggerating about the watchman?

479
00:59:32,623 --> 00:59:35,155
Plumber has come,
he said to stop the tap!

480
00:59:35,235 --> 00:59:37,812
Watchman, what is your name?

481
00:59:38,598 --> 00:59:39,505
Watchman!

482
00:59:46,463 --> 00:59:47,596
Hello!

483
01:00:13,473 --> 01:00:15,722
Hi uncle, hi aunty!

484
01:00:15,990 --> 01:00:17,037
Hi!

485
01:00:18,697 --> 01:00:19,874
Come dear, coma and sit!

486
01:00:30,399 --> 01:00:33,504
Brother,
Radha and Vikram love each other.

487
01:00:35,225 --> 01:00:37,214
We all like Radha a lot!

488
01:00:37,294 --> 01:00:40,690
All that is fine! If you
all like my daughter, is it enough?

489
01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:42,282
Should I not like your son?

490
01:00:42,362 --> 01:00:44,953
What does my son lack!
He stood first in SI training.

491
01:00:45,033 --> 01:00:46,475
In a couple of days he'll
get the posting for sure!

492
01:00:46,555 --> 01:00:47,388
Father!

493
01:01:02,345 --> 01:01:05,687
Uncle, tell me what I
should do to make you like me!

494
01:01:06,462 --> 01:01:08,219
I'm willing to do anything for Radha.

495
01:01:20,494 --> 01:01:25,178
Brother-in-law, when I see your affection
and your children's' good conduct..

496
01:01:25,258 --> 01:01:28,771
..I feel my daughter is going to be
happier in your house than she was here.

497
01:01:32,507 --> 01:01:36,686
She is a motherless child, if
she commits any mistake unknowingly..

498
01:01:37,108 --> 01:01:38,983
..please forgive her with a big heart.

499
01:01:42,263 --> 01:01:43,431
Daddy!

500
01:01:49,891 --> 01:01:55,133
Brother-in-law, if you wish so, you can
make your son-in-law stay in your house!

501
01:01:55,213 --> 01:01:57,015
We don't need such a fortune,
brother-in-law.

502
01:01:57,095 --> 01:01:59,672
You people can take your
daughter-in-law to your house!

503
01:02:03,019 --> 01:02:06,362
Brother, find an auspicious
day and set the muhurtham!

504
01:02:06,442 --> 01:02:08,998
Sure, today itself I'll
ask the pundit and get a good..

505
01:02:09,175 --> 01:02:11,112
..muhurtham and inform you people.

506
01:02:11,192 --> 01:02:11,926
See you later, Brother-in-law!

507
01:02:12,006 --> 01:02:12,856
Sure, Brother-in-law!

508
01:02:12,936 --> 01:02:13,929
See you my dear!

509
01:02:15,734 --> 01:02:16,660
Bye.

510
01:02:17,312 --> 01:02:18,475
Bye!

511
01:02:41,820 --> 01:02:43,187
Watchman.

512
01:02:45,369 --> 01:02:46,548
Lift the boy!

513
01:02:58,055 --> 01:03:00,483
Watchman, put the boy down!

514
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:04,833
Wait!

515
01:03:08,795 --> 01:03:12,543
See Vinay, from now on you have to
take support of this leg pad and walk.

516
01:03:13,573 --> 01:03:15,931
If you think you can't do it,
you can't do anything.

517
01:03:16,011 --> 01:03:17,733
On the other hand, if you
decide that you can accomplish it..

518
01:03:17,813 --> 01:03:19,005
..you can handle anything.

519
01:03:20,524 --> 01:03:23,640
Motivate your brain,
which thinks I can't walk!

520
01:03:25,219 --> 01:03:26,840
Activate your body!

521
01:03:40,513 --> 01:03:42,792
Even if your step falters
or you trip and fall down..

522
01:03:42,872 --> 01:03:44,000
..you have to bring yourself up!

523
01:03:44,718 --> 01:03:48,240
If you listen to your heart,
you can never walk in your life again!

524
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:51,160
Awaken your mind and soul.

525
01:03:51,491 --> 01:03:55,165
Vivekananda said, strength
is life and weakness is death!

526
01:03:55,829 --> 01:03:58,299
If you decide you can
definitely walk again.

527
01:03:58,379 --> 01:04:01,295
Even if you fall down a few times
you'll get up and walk again for sure.

528
01:04:01,375 --> 01:04:03,483
If you want to win,
you have to step forward tirelessly..

529
01:04:03,563 --> 01:04:06,429
..how many ever difficulties
might come your way.

530
01:04:39,708 --> 01:04:42,750
Brother, find an auspicious
day and set the muhurtham!

531
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:44,500
Okay!

532
01:04:57,833 --> 01:05:00,208
Watchman, have you gone mad?

533
01:05:00,375 --> 01:05:02,250
Why are you doing like this? Give way!

534
01:06:30,208 --> 01:06:34,542
Hey, you have killed our trust!

535
01:06:35,542 --> 01:06:38,125
From many years we live here together.

536
01:06:38,333 --> 01:06:42,250
We may not trust each other,
but we all trust the watchman!

537
01:06:44,625 --> 01:06:47,167
If we are going out we
handover the house keys to you!

538
01:06:47,667 --> 01:06:50,458
If the womenfolk in our houses are alone,
we inform you and go out.

539
01:06:51,125 --> 01:06:53,417
You have betrayed that trust today.

540
01:06:53,583 --> 01:06:55,042
Disloyal fellow!

541
01:06:56,042 --> 01:06:57,083
Why do you talk to him, Sir?

542
01:06:57,250 --> 01:06:59,333
It's like chanting vedas
in from of demons! You give way!

543
01:06:59,583 --> 01:07:02,417
You wait uncle,
we'll give him coating in our style!

544
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:05,167
No. no! we'll send him away!

545
01:07:05,250 --> 01:07:06,917
If you send away someone
who did a mistake, it's not right!

546
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,302
Today he held your
daughters' hand, later..

547
01:07:08,382 --> 01:07:09,917
..he may do the same
thing to some other girl!

548
01:07:10,583 --> 01:07:13,003
Oh, no no! you be quite sir.

549
01:07:13,083 --> 01:07:14,125
Why do we need all this nuisance?

550
01:07:14,208 --> 01:07:16,333
If we call police,
they'll come and take this fellow away!

551
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:19,250
You wait uncle! We'll handle him!

552
01:07:19,458 --> 01:07:21,208
You held Radha sister's hand?

553
01:07:21,542 --> 01:07:22,417
Stop it!

554
01:07:23,125 --> 01:07:24,667
First, send him out.

555
01:07:27,375 --> 01:07:29,292
Did you see our Radha sister's good heart?

556
01:07:29,458 --> 01:07:31,208
Though you caught
her hand she forgave you.

557
01:07:31,375 --> 01:07:34,208
Why do you still talk, take him away.

558
01:07:35,833 --> 01:07:37,625
Oh, no no! don't do anything to him, boys!

559
01:07:47,042 --> 01:07:48,792
You frightened us, right?

560
01:08:14,667 --> 01:08:18,292
You people have humiliated
me publicly and beat me until..

561
01:08:18,375 --> 01:08:20,000
..I bleed and threw me out!

562
01:08:21,417 --> 01:08:22,458
You'll die!

563
01:08:23,458 --> 01:08:25,500
All of you people will die.

564
01:08:26,042 --> 01:08:29,333
There will be a dead body
every day in this apartment.

565
01:08:29,917 --> 01:08:32,292
My words are ultimate!

566
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:36,042
You'll die, all of you will die!

567
01:08:36,667 --> 01:08:38,333
All of you will die!

568
01:08:46,792 --> 01:08:49,125
That watchman frightened us, man!
I can't take it!

569
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:52,042
It was his bad luck that he came here!

570
01:08:52,417 --> 01:08:57,750
Hey man, until that Mosa garu
finds another watchman, we are free birds!

571
01:08:57,833 --> 01:08:59,125
Why do we need his nonsense now?

572
01:08:59,208 --> 01:09:00,500
Let's enjoy the party!

573
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,208
Cheers!

574
01:09:08,542 --> 01:09:11,583
Hey, it looks like that watchman has come!

575
01:09:12,292 --> 01:09:15,583
He'll not leave us alone so easily,
okay! Run boys!

576
01:09:37,958 --> 01:09:41,167
Mosa garu, pavan babu has died sir.

577
01:09:41,250 --> 01:09:43,042
Call the police, sir!

578
01:09:59,875 --> 01:10:01,958
Pavan, pavan!

579
01:10:03,125 --> 01:10:04,000
Pavan.

580
01:10:16,625 --> 01:10:20,542
He did what he said!
He killed my child, sir!

581
01:10:21,125 --> 01:10:22,208
What does that mean?

582
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:23,833
I'll tell you all that!

583
01:10:30,083 --> 01:10:32,920
There will be a dead body
every day in this apartment.

584
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,625
We thought, because those boys
hit him he said all that in anger.

585
01:10:35,917 --> 01:10:38,125
We didn't think he'll really kill!

586
01:10:38,375 --> 01:10:39,000
Sir.

587
01:10:44,125 --> 01:10:47,208
Because we hit him he
killed one of us with revenge.

588
01:10:48,083 --> 01:10:50,875
We are very scared whom
he is going to kill tomorrow!

589
01:10:52,417 --> 01:10:55,667
Don't worry!
You don't have to be scared at all!

590
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,125
I'll handle everything.

591
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:01,208
I'm going to catch him for sure!

592
01:11:06,625 --> 01:11:08,000
Especially you be careful.

593
01:11:08,750 --> 01:11:10,833
At any situation,
you shouldn't go out alone.

594
01:11:11,042 --> 01:11:13,667
If at all anything urgent,
you take somebody with you!

595
01:11:14,083 --> 01:11:14,792
Be careful!

596
01:11:16,208 --> 01:11:19,000
On the first day that he came,
Radhamma had told me to..

597
01:11:19,333 --> 01:11:21,542
..send that fellow away as he is not good!

598
01:11:22,333 --> 01:11:24,208
I didn't listen to her on that day.

599
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:29,208
If I had heeded on that day,
today this wouldn't have happened sir!

600
01:11:31,375 --> 01:11:33,000
Which agency had sent him?

601
01:11:33,208 --> 01:11:36,083
Falcon security agency, sir!
They've come recently!

602
01:11:44,583 --> 01:11:46,125
Greetings Sir. Please be seated!

603
01:11:49,542 --> 01:11:52,458
You have sent Rudra to Madhuram
apartments, we need his details.

604
01:11:52,542 --> 01:11:53,167
Why sir?

605
01:11:53,250 --> 01:11:53,833
What?

606
01:11:54,208 --> 01:11:55,750
If we don't tell what happened,
will you not give?

607
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,583
I just wanted to know what happened.

608
01:11:57,667 --> 01:12:00,167
He brutally murdered a resident
of that apartment and escaped!

609
01:12:00,458 --> 01:12:02,417
My God! One minute Sir!

610
01:12:09,917 --> 01:12:11,000
Name alone is there sir.

611
01:12:11,208 --> 01:12:12,625
Is name alone enough?

612
01:12:13,042 --> 01:12:14,208
Will you not take address details!

613
01:12:15,833 --> 01:12:17,708
Even that name Rudra,
he himself must have taken!

614
01:12:17,917 --> 01:12:19,208
He's planned everything.

615
01:12:20,667 --> 01:12:22,292
How can you appoint
a watchman in that way?

616
01:12:25,708 --> 01:12:26,708
From how long do you know him?

617
01:12:26,792 --> 01:12:28,439
He came to our office,
searching for a job three months ago.

618
01:12:28,519 --> 01:12:29,708
He kept asking us every day for work.

619
01:12:30,750 --> 01:12:33,042
One day, the Madhuram
apartment president..

620
01:12:33,250 --> 01:12:36,958
..Mr. Mosa called me and warned
me that they need a watchman immediately.

621
01:12:37,250 --> 01:12:40,083
We have ten years agreement with
that apartment to provide it security.

622
01:12:40,167 --> 01:12:42,542
That fellow came exactly at that time.
Sir, he is new!

623
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,708
When I came to know that
he didn't work anywhere as the..

624
01:12:44,792 --> 01:12:47,083
..security guard, I decided
that he'll be the right guy for that..

625
01:12:47,167 --> 01:12:48,583
..Madhuram apartments and sent him there.

626
01:12:50,042 --> 01:12:51,625
Why did you think he is the
right person for that apartment?

627
01:12:51,708 --> 01:12:55,667
Actually sir,
no one liked to work in that apartment.

628
01:12:57,375 --> 01:12:58,167
Why did no one like?

629
01:12:58,250 --> 01:13:00,167
There were rumors that there
is a ghost in that apartment..

630
01:13:00,458 --> 01:13:03,542
..parking area,
and that'll never let anyone stay there.

631
01:13:03,750 --> 01:13:04,417
Ghost?

632
01:13:04,708 --> 01:13:07,708
Yes sir! That's why
no one liked to work there!

633
01:13:08,375 --> 01:13:10,958
Rudra is new here, he doesn't
know anything about that apartment.

634
01:13:11,125 --> 01:13:14,250
That's why I sent him there sir.
That's all!

635
01:13:14,958 --> 01:13:16,667
How can he not know anything
about that apartment?

636
01:13:16,917 --> 01:13:18,458
He used to sweep the
roads around that area!

637
01:13:18,583 --> 01:13:19,333
Really?

638
01:13:19,792 --> 01:13:22,792
I think that's why he was so
elated when I said about that apartment.

639
01:13:22,875 --> 01:13:25,125
I thought he's happy because he got a job!

640
01:13:25,792 --> 01:13:27,480
Will you call the guy who
left the apartment last time..

641
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:29,083
..because he said there is a ghost?

642
01:13:29,167 --> 01:13:30,500
He is not here sir.

643
01:13:30,708 --> 01:13:33,208
Last time when he saw the ghost
he lost his mind and became mad.

644
01:13:33,292 --> 01:13:35,667
He is getting treated in
the Erragadda mental hospital!

645
01:13:37,958 --> 01:13:39,667
This is not a normal case.

646
01:13:40,458 --> 01:13:42,125
There's lot of matter behind it.

647
01:13:42,792 --> 01:13:44,917
To find out the mysterious
connection between Rudra..

648
01:13:45,083 --> 01:13:47,708
..that murder and the ghost,
I have to pull the right cords..

649
01:13:48,833 --> 01:13:50,333
..and shake everything up.

650
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,625
Ajay, get some water!

651
01:14:51,417 --> 01:14:52,042
Sit down.

652
01:14:59,042 --> 01:15:00,000
Tell me now!

653
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:04,625
What is the relation between you and that
watchman who murderer in that apartment?

654
01:15:06,417 --> 01:15:11,343
That fellow used to..

655
01:15:11,592 --> 01:15:15,708
..work along with us as a contract worker.

656
01:15:16,333 --> 01:15:17,875
That's how I know him.

657
01:15:19,292 --> 01:15:24,333
Because of that friendliness I used
to go to that apartment, now and then!

658
01:15:24,625 --> 01:15:25,750
That's all sir.

659
01:15:31,542 --> 01:15:34,000
That night,
I saw you bury something there.

660
01:15:35,125 --> 01:15:35,792
What was that?

661
01:15:36,125 --> 01:15:37,208
Lemon, sir!

662
01:15:38,333 --> 01:15:40,917
True sir, they were just lemon.

663
01:15:41,917 --> 01:15:44,375
My husband doesn't work.
He is an alcoholic.

664
01:15:44,708 --> 01:15:47,583
He spends all my earnings for his liquor.

665
01:15:48,176 --> 01:15:50,173
I have a grownup daughter, sir.

666
01:15:50,417 --> 01:15:54,982
I want to arrange money
for my girls wedding..

667
01:15:55,271 --> 01:15:59,760
..so I save my money without
my husband's knowledge..

668
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:05,458
..and bury it in that
apartment in few places, sir.

669
01:16:06,708 --> 01:16:10,367
I dig a hole and bury some money
and cover it with dirt and lemons there..

670
01:16:10,447 --> 01:16:12,186
..and cover again with dirt,
so that no one will check it.

671
01:16:12,583 --> 01:16:15,145
Even if they do, they'll only
see lemon and then they'll get scared..

672
01:16:15,225 --> 01:16:17,875
..and will not dig deeper,
that's what I thought sir.

673
01:16:18,792 --> 01:16:22,003
When I came to know that apartment
people hit Rudra and chased him away

674
01:16:22,083 --> 01:16:25,375
..that same night I went and..

675
01:16:27,417 --> 01:16:29,625
..took all my money and came back sir.

676
01:16:29,708 --> 01:16:30,375
True, sir.

677
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:31,500
I swear on my daughter!

678
01:16:31,708 --> 01:16:32,333
Okay.

679
01:16:33,667 --> 01:16:34,292
You go!

680
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:44,875
Who killed that boy?

681
01:16:45,542 --> 01:16:49,250
Was it Rudra or the
ghost in that apartment?

682
01:16:49,417 --> 01:16:51,875
If we catch Rudra,
we'll come to know the truth sir!

683
01:16:53,708 --> 01:16:55,667
No, that's for later!

684
01:16:57,417 --> 01:16:59,375
First we have to take care
of the ghost in that apartment.

685
01:17:06,583 --> 01:17:09,250
SI sir, why did you
ask us all to come here?

686
01:17:16,417 --> 01:17:18,208
When we were enquiring
about the watchman who is..

687
01:17:18,292 --> 01:17:19,750
..supposed to have committed
a murder in this apartment..

688
01:17:19,917 --> 01:17:22,042
..we came to know about
some unbelievable truths, I..

689
01:17:22,583 --> 01:17:23,583
..mean matters.

690
01:17:23,750 --> 01:17:25,000
What are they sir?

691
01:17:26,417 --> 01:17:28,636
Do you all know why
all the previous watchmen..

692
01:17:28,716 --> 01:17:32,333
..used to run away from this apartment?

693
01:17:32,708 --> 01:17:34,042
Why is that, son?

694
01:17:38,542 --> 01:17:40,292
In your apartment parking..

695
01:17:42,625 --> 01:17:43,667
..there is a ghost

696
01:17:45,833 --> 01:17:46,708
Ghost?

697
01:17:49,375 --> 01:17:50,542
Has anyone of you ever..

698
01:17:52,125 --> 01:17:56,292
I know it's funny, seen a ghost?

699
01:17:57,667 --> 01:17:59,500
We've never seen a ghost sir!

700
01:18:00,083 --> 01:18:02,333
It's the first time we have
heard that word here, from your mouth.

701
01:18:03,333 --> 01:18:07,125
If there is really a ghost here,
it should frighten us or kill us!

702
01:18:07,667 --> 01:18:09,708
But frightening the watchman,
how does that make sense, sir?

703
01:18:13,125 --> 01:18:14,583
Isn't it? Logic, right?

704
01:18:25,667 --> 01:18:27,042
I came here to find that out.

705
01:18:28,667 --> 01:18:31,667
Who among you have frightened
the watchmen and chased them away.

706
01:18:33,042 --> 01:18:34,167
I need to know now!

707
01:18:36,458 --> 01:18:38,208
If you tell on your own its better.

708
01:18:39,958 --> 01:18:41,292
Because if I ask in my style..

709
01:18:42,958 --> 01:18:44,292
..you guys can't bear it.

710
01:18:46,958 --> 01:18:48,167
What's all this man?

711
01:18:51,417 --> 01:18:52,333
Sir..

712
01:18:56,250 --> 01:18:57,167
..we used to do that.

713
01:18:57,583 --> 01:19:02,375
At night, we used to wear ghost
masks and frighten the watchmen!

714
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:04,917
Sir, did you hear that?

715
01:19:05,083 --> 01:19:06,542
What's the benefit for
you in frightening them?

716
01:19:06,792 --> 01:19:11,375
Sir, once police booked
us in a drunk and drive case.

717
01:19:12,083 --> 01:19:14,375
They called our parents
and counseled them.

718
01:19:15,333 --> 01:19:17,667
That's how our parents
came to know that we drink.

719
01:19:18,042 --> 01:19:20,042
They warned us that they'll
stop giving us our pocket money.

720
01:19:20,375 --> 01:19:22,667
We made a plan that we should
not get caught even if we drink.

721
01:19:22,917 --> 01:19:25,875
We planned a scheme,
and made a deal with watchman Shivayya.

722
01:19:26,292 --> 01:19:27,787
If we give him a quarter every day..

723
01:19:27,867 --> 01:19:29,833
..he'll allow us to party
in the parking during the night.

724
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,417
From then on, we used to booze
in the parking lot every night.

725
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:37,208
Shivayya wanted to cash our
weakness and he started to blackmail us.

726
01:19:37,708 --> 01:19:41,000
He used to demand us for money or liquor,
whenever he wanted.

727
01:19:41,208 --> 01:19:42,774
Since we couldn't cope
with that we started to..

728
01:19:42,854 --> 01:19:44,250
..think about a way
to send him away from here.

729
01:19:44,375 --> 01:19:46,167
That's when we got an idea.

730
01:19:47,042 --> 01:19:48,355
How about wearing ghosts mask..

731
01:19:48,435 --> 01:19:51,083
..and frighten the watchman
so that he runs away on his own?

732
01:19:51,458 --> 01:19:52,833
We all liked that idea!

733
01:19:53,083 --> 01:19:55,542
We did just that and the plan succeeded.

734
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,962
Then we started chasing away all
the watchmen that came to this apartment.

735
01:20:00,042 --> 01:20:01,708
Then, why didn't you frighten Rudra?

736
01:20:02,125 --> 01:20:04,667
We tried sir, but it didn't work out!

737
01:20:05,125 --> 01:20:06,875
Instead that Rudra frigtened us.

738
01:20:20,833 --> 01:20:21,917
Sai.

739
01:20:22,083 --> 01:20:23,042
Sai.

740
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:24,250
My son.

741
01:20:26,042 --> 01:20:26,792
Sai!

742
01:20:27,333 --> 01:20:28,167
Take the pictures!

743
01:20:29,458 --> 01:20:30,250
My son!

744
01:20:35,667 --> 01:20:36,250
Who saw it?

745
01:20:36,333 --> 01:20:39,125
I've seen it sir. I came up
here to put my clothes for drying.

746
01:20:39,542 --> 01:20:41,333
He was lying there dead.

747
01:20:51,875 --> 01:20:52,917
My son. Sai!

748
01:20:53,042 --> 01:20:53,625
Sai!

749
01:20:56,250 --> 01:21:00,000
Sir, see this sir!

750
01:21:00,583 --> 01:21:02,667
That fellow did what he said, Sir?

751
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:04,708
Vikram.

752
01:21:06,542 --> 01:21:08,458
Did you see this? He did what he said.

753
01:21:08,875 --> 01:21:10,750
Do something and catch that fellow, son!

754
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:13,367
The people in this apartment
are shivering with fear..

755
01:21:13,447 --> 01:21:16,000
..thinking about what
is going to happen next.

756
01:21:16,250 --> 01:21:17,208
Please catch him, Sir!

757
01:21:17,292 --> 01:21:21,833
Sir, he'll not spare us, sir.
Please sir, save us sir.

758
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,083
Sir, next it's my turn
or this fellows' sir.

759
01:21:24,375 --> 01:21:26,583
We are scared he might
kill both of us together, sir!

760
01:21:26,792 --> 01:21:28,250
We'll run away and hide somewhere sir.

761
01:21:30,208 --> 01:21:31,625
It's safer for you to be here.

762
01:21:31,792 --> 01:21:33,708
If you go out,
he'll find you people easily.

763
01:21:34,167 --> 01:21:35,339
Moreover, outside we can't
give you the kind of security..

764
01:21:35,419 --> 01:21:36,458
..that we are able to provide you here.

765
01:21:36,750 --> 01:21:39,000
Don't go out of your
flats until he is caught!

766
01:21:39,542 --> 01:21:41,500
We'll surely catch him. Be careful.

767
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,875
I know this. I can't hurt anyone.

768
01:21:58,458 --> 01:22:02,211
That Rudra used to come with
me in the lift every day night..

769
01:22:02,291 --> 01:22:05,000
..until my house, but I couldn't
question his asking why he is stalking me.

770
01:22:07,542 --> 01:22:10,750
I never thought he'll take this as
an excuse and start misbehaving with me.

771
01:22:12,208 --> 01:22:15,708
It's such a sad thing that those
boys got caught in all this because of me.

772
01:22:16,167 --> 01:22:18,500
I'm the reason for all these murders!

773
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,333
Radha, you don't be sad.

774
01:22:22,708 --> 01:22:25,000
It's my responsibility
to keep everyone safe.

775
01:22:25,250 --> 01:22:29,250
I'll catch that Rudra at any cost.
Dead or alive!

776
01:22:31,958 --> 01:22:36,208
Radha, I'll never let tears
roll from your eyes, I promise.

777
01:23:02,542 --> 01:23:08,500
"O my dearest, o my dearest!"

778
01:23:09,125 --> 01:23:14,125
"You have add the colour
of your dreams to my eyes and.."

779
01:23:14,208 --> 01:23:19,458
"..made my world beautiful! "

780
01:23:19,542 --> 01:23:25,333
"I'll become the sound of
your heart and stay within you as.."

781
01:23:25,417 --> 01:23:30,750
"..if I'm the breath in your life.

782
01:23:30,833 --> 01:23:35,708
"O my dearest, o my dearest!
O my dearest, o my dearest!"

783
01:23:37,333 --> 01:23:42,417
"These three knots have
become hundred years journey."

784
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:47,625
You are in me and I'm in you!"

785
01:23:47,708 --> 01:23:53,208
"My steps have learned
dance because of you.."

786
01:23:53,292 --> 01:23:58,708
"..my breath has learned
to sing because of you!"

787
01:24:22,333 --> 01:24:33,583
"Our destination is same and
let's continue this friendship.."

788
01:24:33,667 --> 01:24:47,292
"..at every step and every second,
O my dearest!"

789
01:24:47,542 --> 01:24:55,000
"Let's stay together for all the yugas,
O my dearest!"

790
01:24:55,208 --> 01:24:58,000
"O my dearest!"

791
01:25:21,708 --> 01:25:27,167
"This ours is the oldest new love story."

792
01:25:27,250 --> 01:25:32,750
"You are the greatest
companion for my heart. "

793
01:25:32,833 --> 01:25:43,333
"You are the heart of my
heart and I feel I'm the luckiest.."

794
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:46,792
"..o my dearest!"

795
01:25:47,083 --> 01:25:51,920
"The happiness showered
me and drenched me, o my dearest!

796
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:57,708
"O my dearest! O my dearest!"

797
01:26:00,833 --> 01:26:03,375
Police is searching for
this murderer who killed two..

798
01:26:03,458 --> 01:26:06,417
..people in Madhuram
apartments and escaped.

799
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:08,083
If anyone finds a whereabouts of this man,
City police..

800
01:26:08,167 --> 01:26:10,500
..department personnel has
requested the public to call..

801
01:26:10,583 --> 01:26:13,000
..on the below given numbers
to give any information.

802
01:26:35,083 --> 01:26:37,000
Sir, it's me who called you sir!

803
01:26:41,667 --> 01:26:42,708
Call two constables!

804
01:26:54,125 --> 01:26:57,708
What is this, this guy murdered two people
and here he is sleeping so peacefully?

805
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,458
He drank the juice from the fridge,
he'll not wake up now.

806
01:27:00,667 --> 01:27:02,000
Hey, what is this juice from the fridge?

807
01:27:02,083 --> 01:27:05,542
Yes sir! After my father's death
my mother became mad due to tension.

808
01:27:05,958 --> 01:27:08,667
For her to sleep well in the
night she has to take sleeping pills.

809
01:27:08,832 --> 01:27:11,208
But she hates taking tablets
and she never used to take them.

810
01:27:11,375 --> 01:27:13,893
So we started mixing them in the
juice and give her a glass full of juice..

811
01:27:13,973 --> 01:27:15,750
..mixed with the tablets every night,
which we keep in the fridge all the time.

812
01:27:15,833 --> 01:27:17,077
That's why this fellow
doesn't know about all that..

813
01:27:17,157 --> 01:27:18,042
..he thought it's just juice and have it.

814
01:27:18,125 --> 01:27:19,500
That's why he is sleeping like this.

815
01:27:20,833 --> 01:27:23,417
He slept a lot, wake him up!

816
01:27:41,375 --> 01:27:42,625
Why am I here?

817
01:27:44,083 --> 01:27:45,500
Why are you hitting me?

818
01:27:45,763 --> 01:27:49,329
If we investigate you
in the police station..

819
01:27:49,409 --> 01:27:51,250
..there will be many
rules and regulations.

820
01:27:51,833 --> 01:27:53,292
While here, no rules!

821
01:27:54,333 --> 01:27:57,500
If you don't tell the truth, I can even
encounter you and no one can question me.

822
01:27:57,708 --> 01:27:58,708
Ajay.

823
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,250
Do we look like fools to you?

824
01:28:10,417 --> 01:28:14,333
Why did you kill those two so brutally?
Tell me! Tell!

825
01:28:18,333 --> 01:28:19,667
I guessed it!

826
01:28:20,083 --> 01:28:23,000
I had guessed something
like this is going to happen!

827
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,903
I was like a watch dog for
those people in that apartment..

828
01:28:26,983 --> 01:28:28,958
..and the beat me up and sent me away.

829
01:28:29,375 --> 01:28:33,583
That's why, that is the reason why
they have brought this upon themselves.

830
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:36,375
What nonsense are you talking?

831
01:28:37,125 --> 01:28:38,167
Tell me the truth.

832
01:28:38,250 --> 01:28:39,667
I'm telling you the truth!

833
01:28:40,667 --> 01:28:43,208
It's not going to stop
with these two deaths.

834
01:28:43,875 --> 01:28:45,125
Some more will die.

835
01:28:45,875 --> 01:28:47,875
Daily there are going to be deaths.

836
01:28:48,333 --> 01:28:49,208
This is the truth!

837
01:28:50,708 --> 01:28:53,833
See, come to the point straight.

838
01:28:54,750 --> 01:28:57,958
Are you killing them or
have you paid people to kill them?

839
01:28:58,583 --> 01:29:01,792
If you talk nonsense I'll shoot you.

840
01:29:02,042 --> 01:29:03,750
You'll shoot me, okay!

841
01:29:04,542 --> 01:29:06,958
How will you kill her
who murdered those two people?

842
01:29:07,750 --> 01:29:08,542
Who is she?

843
01:29:08,708 --> 01:29:13,000
In that same apartment,
the lady who lives in the flat no. 307.

844
01:29:13,875 --> 01:29:14,917
That Pramila?

845
01:29:17,667 --> 01:29:21,917
If you say one more word about Pramila,
I myself will kill you!

846
01:29:23,250 --> 01:29:25,083
Pramila died two years ago.

847
01:29:26,417 --> 01:29:32,667
No, it's been 2 years,
3 months and 15 days until today!

848
01:29:33,417 --> 01:29:36,458
Pramila has turned into a
ghost and she is full of revenge!

849
01:29:36,958 --> 01:29:38,977
Sir, he has committed those
murders and want to shift the blame..

850
01:29:39,057 --> 01:29:42,000
..on a ghost who is not there
and want to escape with this story.

851
01:29:42,708 --> 01:29:45,250
You, don't tell me cock and bull stories!

852
01:29:45,625 --> 01:29:47,625
Moreover, in these days
you talk about ghosts and demons?

853
01:29:47,958 --> 01:29:51,000
Do you plan to side
track the case and escape?

854
01:30:04,833 --> 01:30:08,625
Hail to Lord Shankar!

855
01:30:10,208 --> 01:30:14,083
Hail to Lord Shankar!

856
01:30:15,417 --> 01:30:19,917
Hail to Lord Shankar!

857
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,125
We are sadhus without any selfishness.

858
01:30:23,417 --> 01:30:26,625
We don't know to kill
people but we only save them.

859
01:30:26,750 --> 01:30:29,792
If we have to,
we give our lives to save you people!

860
01:30:29,958 --> 01:30:32,042
Our only goal is this worlds happiness.

861
01:30:32,167 --> 01:30:33,917
Do you know what really happened?

862
01:30:43,583 --> 01:30:45,125
What mother, you are thinking deeply?

863
01:30:48,375 --> 01:30:51,542
Rudhra, yesterdad I had
been to an apartment on the..

864
01:30:51,958 --> 01:30:53,917
..request of those residents
of that apartment to conduct Rudra yagam!

01:32:06,250 --> 01:32:08,875
I'll kill, I'll kill!

872
01:32:09,042 --> 01:32:10,375
I'll kill everyone.

873
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:24,208
I'll kill, I'll kill!

874
01:32:24,292 --> 01:32:25,792
I'll kill everyone.

875
01:32:25,958 --> 01:32:27,487
When you were alive you
were a handicapped person..

876
01:32:27,567 --> 01:32:28,875
..who couldn't take
care of her own chores.

877
01:32:29,167 --> 01:32:30,375
How will you kill now?

878
01:32:30,625 --> 01:32:32,042
I'll kill!

879
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:34,625
I'll kill everyone.

880
01:32:34,958 --> 01:32:37,792
You have turned into an soul and stayed
back here, what do you want to accomplish?

881
01:32:38,417 --> 01:32:41,875
You can't move an inch from
the chair in which you are sitting.

882
01:32:43,750 --> 01:32:47,792
You keep chanting "I'll kill.
I'll kill" and there by gather power.

883
01:32:49,542 --> 01:32:52,625
How much ever power you gather,
you can't do anything!

884
01:32:53,083 --> 01:32:55,542
Do you know why?
Because you are handicapped!

885
01:33:04,417 --> 01:33:07,417
How much ever you keep trying,
it's all waste.

886
01:33:07,792 --> 01:33:10,125
Death is the final
destination for the life!

887
01:33:11,083 --> 01:33:12,625
All those are of no use,
stop chasing them.

888
01:33:12,792 --> 01:33:16,000
Ghost spirit schemes are
dangerous and disastrous.

889
01:33:16,708 --> 01:33:18,917
Leave this earth and go to other world.

890
01:33:19,042 --> 01:33:21,542
As long as you are here,
your soul will not find peace.

891
01:33:22,542 --> 01:33:26,083
An soul without peace has
neither a meaning nor a goal!

892
01:33:26,583 --> 01:33:28,083
Go, go away!

893
01:33:28,333 --> 01:33:31,042
I'll not go, I'll not go anywhere!

894
01:33:31,292 --> 01:33:34,542
Until I take my revenge
I'll not go away from here.

895
01:33:34,667 --> 01:33:38,250
Only after I take the revenge,
my soul will find peace!

896
01:33:38,458 --> 01:33:41,750
Tell me about your revenge, I'll help you!

897
01:33:44,458 --> 01:33:47,542
I'll not tell you! You go away, leave!

898
01:33:47,792 --> 01:33:50,042
Pramila has acquired lot of powers now.

899
01:33:51,417 --> 01:33:54,625
With vengefulness, she wants to kill
all the people she had planned to kill.

900
01:33:54,708 --> 01:33:56,042
What are we going to do now, matha ji?

901
01:33:56,250 --> 01:33:57,971
I told her that she is handicapped..

902
01:33:58,051 --> 01:34:01,625
..and she can't accomplish
anything and made her believe this.

903
01:34:01,833 --> 01:34:04,042
You told us that,
if an soul wants to kill somebody..

904
01:34:04,250 --> 01:34:06,625
..it keeps telling
itself that it'll kill..

905
01:34:06,792 --> 01:34:09,000
..and there by acquire the
power needed to do what it wants to do!

906
01:34:10,292 --> 01:34:12,466
How much ever power
the soul has acquired..

907
01:34:12,546 --> 01:34:14,120
..if it wants to kill somebody..

908
01:34:14,200 --> 01:34:16,292
..it does need another body,
doesn't it matha ji?

909
01:34:16,958 --> 01:34:18,647
That's why,
it has selected the body of Radha..

910
01:34:18,727 --> 01:34:20,583
..who too lives in the same apartment.

911
01:34:21,333 --> 01:34:24,090
If I had not gone to that apartment
for the Rudra yagam yesterday..

912
01:34:24,170 --> 01:34:26,208
..many disasters would have happened!

913
01:34:26,792 --> 01:34:31,400
If we have to pacify that pramila
who is full of vengeance now..

914
01:34:31,876 --> 01:34:33,500
..the powers that I
have now will not be enough.

915
01:34:33,667 --> 01:34:35,250
I'm going to kedarnath!

916
01:34:35,458 --> 01:34:39,130
There I'll do 11 days abishekam
to Shivalingam and bring back..

917
01:34:39,210 --> 01:34:41,708
..the vibudhi (ash) and ganga jalam.

918
01:34:41,792 --> 01:34:47,292
Until then, you have to make
sure that soul doesn't enter Radha's body.

919
01:34:50,083 --> 01:34:54,542
This is most sacred vibudhi (ash),
use only in the most urgent situation.

920
01:34:57,250 --> 01:35:00,500
This raksha will keep
you safe from that soul.

921
01:35:04,167 --> 01:35:06,677
In that way,
because of the matha ji's command..

922
01:35:06,757 --> 01:35:08,958
..I have been keeping
Radha safe all the time.

923
01:35:16,042 --> 01:35:17,750
You have been keeping Radha safe, is it?

924
01:35:18,667 --> 01:35:20,625
Then why did you misbehave with Radha?

925
01:35:21,667 --> 01:35:22,958
That too has a reason!

926
01:35:26,375 --> 01:35:28,833
No, if she hears anyone
saying encouraging words..

927
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:32,920
..that prompt her to action
saying you can do it and you..

928
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:37,458
..can accomplish it,
it's very difficult to stop her!

929
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:25,458
Harahara mahaadeva!

930
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,417
Vibudhi (ash) is finished!

931
01:36:38,125 --> 01:36:40,208
I should not allow the
soul to enter Radha's house.

932
01:36:41,083 --> 01:36:43,583
What should I do?
What am I supposed to do?

933
01:37:05,458 --> 01:37:09,292
Your matha ji worked on my mind
and had confined me to my wheel chair.

934
01:37:10,125 --> 01:37:13,458
But today I have come to know my power.

935
01:37:14,542 --> 01:37:18,250
Now no one can stop me
from entering into Radha's body.

936
01:37:18,792 --> 01:37:22,167
You and your matha ji together,
both of you can't stop me in any way!

937
01:37:39,083 --> 01:37:42,917
If you go out of this apartment,
no one can stop you.

938
01:37:43,125 --> 01:37:45,792
That's why I have confined
you within this apartment!

939
01:37:47,583 --> 01:37:52,625
Hey, I'll make sure you
don't touch Radha's body.

940
01:37:52,875 --> 01:37:56,458
Hail to Lord Shankar!

941
01:37:58,625 --> 01:38:00,625
You have put obstacles in my way!

942
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:05,042
Now see how I will throw
you out of this apartment!

943
01:38:12,708 --> 01:38:16,583
In that way, I managed to stop pramilas
soul from going out of the apartment.

944
01:38:17,042 --> 01:38:18,543
Then I thought of keeping Radha out..

945
01:38:18,623 --> 01:38:22,042
..of the apartment and
I kept waiting for her arrival.

946
01:38:22,417 --> 01:38:24,708
That's why I had to
take hold of Radha's hand.

947
01:39:09,458 --> 01:39:14,583
I didn't have any bad intentions
as you all have assumed.

948
01:39:17,458 --> 01:39:18,987
When those people were beating me..

949
01:39:19,787 --> 01:39:22,333
..the rakshana cord that was tied on
my hand came off and fell somewhere there.

950
01:39:24,292 --> 01:39:27,792
To find that,
I went to that apartment that same night.

951
01:39:48,583 --> 01:39:49,250
Who are you?

952
01:39:56,667 --> 01:39:58,917
Pramila, you .... Here ... again?

953
01:39:59,375 --> 01:40:03,333
I want to kill those people
who killed me and my father.

954
01:40:03,417 --> 01:40:04,917
For that purpose I'm here!

955
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:05,833
What?

956
01:40:06,750 --> 01:40:08,625
Uncle didn't die due to heart attack?

957
01:40:09,167 --> 01:40:10,667
Somebody killed you and uncle, is it?

958
01:40:11,667 --> 01:40:12,958
Who are they?

959
01:40:13,250 --> 01:40:17,292
Parvathi, the accident that took place
on that day has taken you away from us.

960
01:40:17,583 --> 01:40:19,942
I never thought our baby,
who should be running..

961
01:40:20,022 --> 01:40:23,500
..and leaping around like a deer,
will be confined to a wheel chair.

962
01:40:23,667 --> 01:40:27,333
Now I have to live for her,
Parvathi, I'll live for our baby!

963
01:40:39,583 --> 01:40:41,083
How is our new flat, my dear?

964
01:40:42,417 --> 01:40:45,042
In the old house everywhere
there are your memories.

965
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:49,542
Our memories should give
us courage and fortify our lives!

966
01:40:50,458 --> 01:40:52,042
They shouldn't give us pain.

967
01:40:52,333 --> 01:40:55,417
That's why I sold that
old flat and bought this new one!

968
01:40:56,125 --> 01:40:57,792
Why do you cry and feel bad baby?

969
01:40:58,583 --> 01:41:01,381
When I fell in love with
your mother and married her..

970
01:41:01,461 --> 01:41:03,042
..I got disconnected
from all my relatives.

971
01:41:03,958 --> 01:41:07,417
That's why, though we have so
many of our people, we have become loners.

972
01:41:07,875 --> 01:41:12,917
Newness brings along new changes,
here everyone is new to you.

973
01:41:13,708 --> 01:41:17,167
New acquaintances, you'll like them all!

974
01:41:38,625 --> 01:41:39,375
Hi uncle!

975
01:41:39,458 --> 01:41:40,292
Hi dear!

976
01:41:40,500 --> 01:41:41,167
Hi!

977
01:41:49,667 --> 01:41:51,208
Pramila met with an accident, dear!

978
01:41:52,292 --> 01:41:53,958
You have shifted into the flat, newly?

979
01:41:54,417 --> 01:41:55,917
Yes dear, it's us!

980
01:41:56,125 --> 01:41:59,458
We live in the adjacent 305 flat,
me and my father!

981
01:42:00,875 --> 01:42:02,125
Where are you both going?

982
01:42:02,333 --> 01:42:03,500
Not anywhere!

983
01:42:03,833 --> 01:42:05,583
I thought I'll just
take her out for a while.

984
01:42:05,667 --> 01:42:09,208
Uncle, leave that to me!
I'll take Pramila out.

985
01:42:11,167 --> 01:42:12,458
I'll introduce her to everyone!

986
01:43:30,875 --> 01:43:32,167
I'm very happy Pramila.

987
01:43:32,375 --> 01:43:34,500
Since we both are girls without a mother,
we understood..

988
01:43:34,833 --> 01:43:38,875
..each other very well and became
good friends in such short while.

989
01:43:38,958 --> 01:43:41,000
If you face any kind of problem here..

990
01:43:42,667 --> 01:43:44,000
..I'm there to help you out!

991
01:43:44,375 --> 01:43:48,375
I'm going to Hyderabad to collect
funds for Rajesh uncle's orphanage.

992
01:43:48,833 --> 01:43:51,667
I'll be back in about 4 days?
Okay?

993
01:44:05,875 --> 01:44:08,333
Hey, what the hell are you fellows doing?

994
01:44:09,958 --> 01:44:12,189
It's a place for
respectable people to live..

995
01:44:12,269 --> 01:44:15,208
..it's not a bar or pub
for you to get drunk and play!

996
01:44:15,375 --> 01:44:18,542
Oh, really? We don't know that!

997
01:44:19,417 --> 01:44:23,083
Hey, old man!
Hold your tongue or else it'll get cut!

998
01:44:23,167 --> 01:44:25,792
Hey, why should we fight with him?

999
01:44:25,958 --> 01:44:27,125
Let's make him our friend.

1000
01:44:27,250 --> 01:44:30,000
Because, this uncle
has a beautiful daughter!

1001
01:44:30,125 --> 01:44:32,083
At least for her sake we can let him go!

1002
01:44:32,250 --> 01:44:33,750
Hey, she is handicapped!

1003
01:44:33,833 --> 01:44:37,042
So what bro? She is very beautiful.

1004
01:44:37,125 --> 01:44:38,708
She'll not resist us, whatever we do!

1005
01:44:38,958 --> 01:44:40,417
That's what we need, right?

1006
01:44:40,875 --> 01:44:41,667
Shut up!

1007
01:44:42,875 --> 01:44:44,792
It's not your fault that you talk rubbish.

1008
01:44:45,208 --> 01:44:46,625
It's your upbringing that is not right!

1009
01:44:46,917 --> 01:44:48,125
I'll not talk with you now.

1010
01:44:48,417 --> 01:44:50,167
I'll speak with your parents
in the morning tomorrow.

1011
01:44:53,833 --> 01:44:56,083
He slapped me;
I'm going to teach him a lesson bro!

1012
01:44:56,292 --> 01:44:58,458
He said he's going to
complain to our parents..

1013
01:44:58,583 --> 01:45:01,375
If our parents come to know about this,
it's going to be a big issue!

1014
01:45:01,667 --> 01:45:04,042
They'll stop giving us our pocket money.

1015
01:45:04,208 --> 01:45:08,042
He said he'll show us his power tomorrow..

1016
01:45:08,667 --> 01:45:11,583
..we'll show him our power today itself!

1017
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:13,000
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1018
01:45:23,250 --> 01:45:26,042
Tomorrow, from England the
military doctor is going to come here.

1019
01:45:26,667 --> 01:45:30,000
The doctors from here have
sent all your reports to him.

1020
01:45:30,833 --> 01:45:34,417
He checked all of them and said that
we should get ready for the operation.

1021
01:45:34,625 --> 01:45:36,417
That's why I brought this money, my dear!

1022
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:43,792
I can spend any amount of money..

1023
01:45:45,625 --> 01:45:50,500
..so that my little girl can run and leap
around like a deer in front of my eyes!

1024
01:45:53,208 --> 01:45:54,708
Who is it, at this hour?

1025
01:45:54,958 --> 01:45:57,292
Who is it, I'm coming!

1026
01:46:02,250 --> 01:46:03,458
Why have you come here?

1027
01:46:06,750 --> 01:46:09,542
You all just get out,
or else I'll shout and call everyone.

1028
01:46:09,625 --> 01:46:10,750
Are you going to call everyone?

1029
01:46:12,375 --> 01:46:14,000
Bro, the girl!

1030
01:46:25,042 --> 01:46:26,042
See the money!

1031
01:46:28,042 --> 01:46:31,000
If we take so much money,
he'll give police complaint.

1032
01:46:31,500 --> 01:46:32,875
What should we do bro?

1033
01:46:35,042 --> 01:46:35,875
Let's kill!

1034
01:46:37,417 --> 01:46:39,417
If we kill,
will the police leave us alone?

1035
01:46:40,167 --> 01:46:41,750
They'll arrest us and throw us into jail!

1036
01:46:43,833 --> 01:46:45,250
I can't live without liquor!

1037
01:46:47,292 --> 01:46:49,125
We'll make people believe
that the old man got a heart attack!

1038
01:46:49,208 --> 01:46:52,500
Look at the old man; does he
look like someone who gets a heart attack?

1039
01:46:53,792 --> 01:46:55,750
We'll make him get a heart attack!

1040
01:47:00,083 --> 01:47:03,042
See this golden biscuit,
sitting in the wheel chair.

1041
01:47:03,625 --> 01:47:05,667
If we touch her romantically..

1042
01:47:07,958 --> 01:47:10,250
..his heart will stop beating.

1043
01:47:34,792 --> 01:47:37,042
Yes, hit yourself!

1044
01:47:38,792 --> 01:47:39,917
That's what we too want!

1045
01:47:40,083 --> 01:47:43,208
If we get result without killing,
that's good for us!

1046
01:47:43,917 --> 01:47:46,625
Hit until you lose your life!

1047
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:49,375
Yes, hit yourself!

1048
01:48:00,042 --> 01:48:00,958
He's dead!

1049
01:48:10,875 --> 01:48:14,003
Hey, if we kill her too, its better!

1050
01:48:14,083 --> 01:48:16,333
No bro, if they both die,
it's going to be a police case!

1051
01:48:17,375 --> 01:48:18,958
That'll be dangerous for us.
Leave her alone!

1052
01:48:19,500 --> 01:48:21,000
She'll die of hunger and thirst,
in few days.

1053
01:50:20,458 --> 01:50:22,625
We shouldn't spare such idiots!

1054
01:50:22,833 --> 01:50:25,375
I'll put a police case
and make sure they go to jail.

1055
01:50:25,792 --> 01:50:28,000
Such murderers should get punished.

1056
01:50:29,750 --> 01:50:31,625
There's nothing we can do now!

1057
01:50:32,125 --> 01:50:34,646
Are we going to let go
of those people who were reason..

1058
01:50:34,726 --> 01:50:35,792
..for your death and uncles' death?

1059
01:50:38,458 --> 01:50:40,250
I'll not spare them.

1060
01:50:41,250 --> 01:50:46,333
Until I kill them with my own hands,
my revenge will not subside!

1061
01:50:46,542 --> 01:50:48,167
And I'll not leave this place.

1062
01:50:49,917 --> 01:50:53,917
For my purpose to get fulfilled,
I need your help Radha.

1063
01:50:54,292 --> 01:50:56,750
Death is the correct punishment
for those scoundrels.

1064
01:50:57,125 --> 01:50:59,125
Tell me what I should do, Pramila?

1065
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:07,208
Now I'm just an soul with
vengeful heart because I've died.

1066
01:51:08,875 --> 01:51:13,292
If I have to kill those
fellows I'll need your body Radha!

1067
01:51:41,708 --> 01:51:44,458
Hey, it looks like that watchman has come!

1068
01:51:45,167 --> 01:51:47,083
He'll not leave us alone so easily, okay!

1069
01:51:47,542 --> 01:51:48,250
Run boys!

1070
01:51:55,750 --> 01:51:59,083
Hey, who are you?

1071
01:51:59,167 --> 01:52:00,958
You forgot me so soon.

1072
01:52:01,083 --> 01:52:03,708
You had killed me and my father,
haven't you?

1073
01:52:19,500 --> 01:52:25,042
How much ever you scream,
the noise will not come out.

1074
01:53:14,042 --> 01:53:15,829
In that way, with the help of Radha..

1075
01:53:15,909 --> 01:53:20,500
..pramila killed those
two boys and took her revenge.

1076
01:53:20,875 --> 01:53:22,375
This is the real truth.

1077
01:53:22,667 --> 01:53:24,708
Radha is helping Pramilas soul?

1078
01:53:25,125 --> 01:53:27,792
Sir, all the while he had
been talking about your daughter.

1079
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:31,292
She'll help soul's and ghost spirit too!

1080
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:35,250
Sir, do something and help those boys sir!

1081
01:53:37,542 --> 01:53:38,417
Oh no.

1082
01:53:42,958 --> 01:53:44,167
She has killed two people already!

1083
01:53:45,917 --> 01:53:47,375
And plans to kill two more.

1084
01:53:47,958 --> 01:53:49,125
We have to go to the apartment.

1085
01:53:49,542 --> 01:53:50,333
Let's go.

1086
01:53:50,708 --> 01:53:51,667
Sir, you too come along sir!

1087
01:53:52,875 --> 01:53:55,333
The cord that matha
ji tied to my hand is gone.

1088
01:53:55,708 --> 01:53:58,583
It's not easy to stop the soul's,
as you imagine.

1089
01:53:58,917 --> 01:54:01,042
I'll go to the ashram and
get that rakshana cord again.

1090
01:54:03,875 --> 01:54:07,167
But one point SI sir,
you have to be very careful.

1091
01:54:08,250 --> 01:54:10,333
If you act in haste,
your life gets into danger.

1092
01:54:10,750 --> 01:54:12,917
Rudra garu,
now what is the condition of my daughter?

1093
01:54:13,125 --> 01:54:15,458
Everything that Parameshwara
will take care of.

1094
01:54:15,542 --> 01:54:17,792
Hail to Lord Shankar!

1095
01:54:59,542 --> 01:55:00,708
What is this life!

1096
01:55:01,042 --> 01:55:02,663
We used to be like race horses..

1097
01:55:02,743 --> 01:55:05,958
..because of that watchman
we have become central jail prisoners.

1098
01:55:08,375 --> 01:55:11,417
Fear of death is the
most stressful matter in life.

1099
01:55:11,917 --> 01:55:16,417
Either to frighten fear or to remove
all sadness, alcohol is the best solution!

1100
01:55:16,833 --> 01:55:20,708
Hey, bro! Come, let's go out.
I'll handle whatever happens.

1101
01:55:25,750 --> 01:55:27,042
Hey.. wake up.

1102
01:55:30,500 --> 01:55:32,792
Hey.. wake up.

1103
01:55:38,500 --> 01:55:40,000
What, shekar!

1104
01:55:41,083 --> 01:55:43,583
You people also commit murders, right?

1105
01:55:44,250 --> 01:55:48,750
Then why are you so
scared when you see death?

1106
01:55:48,833 --> 01:55:53,750
Sister, Radha sister,
we didn't kill anyone willingly sister!

1107
01:55:55,375 --> 01:55:57,417
We did it when we were
under the influence of alcohol.

1108
01:55:58,542 --> 01:56:01,208
And we got our punishment for that sister.

1109
01:56:02,875 --> 01:56:08,625
I've started to understand that God will
not forgive us if we cheat good people.

1110
01:56:09,917 --> 01:56:13,833
The 25 lakhs that we took from
uncle on that day were lost in betting.

1111
01:56:13,917 --> 01:56:17,417
Because of that sin,
my three friends have died.

1112
01:56:19,292 --> 01:56:21,667
Please sister; I've done what is wrong.

1113
01:56:21,750 --> 01:56:23,708
I'll never do anything
like this again, sister.

1114
01:56:23,875 --> 01:56:26,042
Forgive me sister, please sister.

1115
01:56:26,417 --> 01:56:27,292
Sister.

1116
01:56:27,833 --> 01:56:29,042
I made mistake.

1117
01:56:29,125 --> 01:56:32,583
Forgive me sister.
I'll never do anything like this again.

1118
01:56:35,417 --> 01:56:36,292
Sister

1119
01:56:37,042 --> 01:56:39,000
Pramila has died very long ago, right?

1120
01:56:39,167 --> 01:56:40,292
Why is she there?

1121
01:56:43,125 --> 01:56:44,042
Sister.

1122
01:57:21,458 --> 01:57:25,125
When I was handicapped,
I was scared of you!

1123
01:57:25,208 --> 01:57:27,000
And you made fun of me.

1124
01:57:27,083 --> 01:57:29,639
Now, when I'm asking
you to come closer to me..

1125
01:57:29,719 --> 01:57:32,292
..why are you getting
scared and running away?

1126
01:57:32,458 --> 01:57:34,833
Are you arrogant because
your limbs are working?

1127
01:58:03,083 --> 01:58:05,083
He killed my father.

1128
01:58:05,667 --> 01:58:08,333
No one can stop me from killing him now.

1129
01:58:08,417 --> 01:58:09,583
You go away from here!

1130
01:58:09,750 --> 01:58:12,000
He may have been the reason
for your death and your father's death.

1131
01:58:13,458 --> 01:58:15,292
But there is law to
give him his punishment.

1132
01:58:16,875 --> 01:58:18,667
I'll make sure he gets punished.

1133
01:58:20,167 --> 01:58:21,875
You leave Radha's body and go away.

1134
01:58:22,042 --> 01:58:26,375
I'll not leave Radha's
body until I finish killing him.

1135
01:58:26,750 --> 01:58:29,083
You move aside, go away! Go.

1136
01:58:29,250 --> 01:58:32,083
I know very well how to
bring you out of Radha's body.

1137
01:58:34,333 --> 01:58:35,625
Your strength is..

1138
01:58:36,417 --> 01:58:38,958
..only while you are inside this building.

1139
01:58:40,167 --> 01:58:41,708
You can't go out from here..

1140
01:58:42,875 --> 01:58:43,958
..how much ever you may try.

1141
01:58:52,458 --> 01:58:53,417
Hey, shekar wait!

1142
01:59:37,375 --> 01:59:38,083
Vikram.

1143
01:59:39,458 --> 01:59:40,708
What happened to me?

1144
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,375
Radha, do you realize what you are doing?

1145
01:59:58,083 --> 02:00:00,875
This fellow ruined
pramilas beautiful life.

1146
02:00:01,250 --> 02:00:03,500
He has no right to be alive.

1147
02:00:20,292 --> 02:00:23,250
As long as you are there,
you'll be stopping me.

1148
02:00:23,500 --> 02:00:24,958
I'll kill you!

1149
02:01:04,125 --> 02:01:08,250
Did that God send you here
to save the people who have sinned?

1150
02:01:08,333 --> 02:01:13,750
It's the great God who punishes
sinners and saves righteous people.

1151
02:01:14,125 --> 02:01:15,583
Who are we to say anything!

1152
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:19,000
Anyhow, what do you know
about that Omni present God?

1153
02:01:20,042 --> 02:01:24,042
He always likes to forgive
but doesn't punish anyone.

1154
02:01:24,125 --> 02:01:28,125
I'm not the God you all believe in,
to forgive a sinner.

1155
02:01:28,500 --> 02:01:30,125
I'm a vengeful demon.

1156
02:01:31,583 --> 02:01:34,958
Mine is not a story,
but a revengeful agony.

1157
02:01:35,083 --> 02:01:37,917
Don't try to stop me, leave me alone.

1158
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:38,750
Pramila!

1159
02:01:39,042 --> 02:01:44,042
[Sanskrit chants]

1160
02:01:44,583 --> 02:01:48,625
[Sanskrit chants]

1161
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,692
A person who thinks soul
can kill others or a person..

1162
02:01:52,772 --> 02:01:57,208
..who thinks soul can get killed
by others, both these are foolish.

1163
02:01:57,292 --> 02:02:02,360
Because, in Geeta, Govinda has
said that soul will not kill anyone..

1164
02:02:02,440 --> 02:02:04,583
..nor get killed by anyone.

1165
02:02:05,125 --> 02:02:10,000
You need to know, that our
births and deaths are due to our deeds.

1166
02:02:10,292 --> 02:02:13,198
There is no record in any history that..

1167
02:02:13,278 --> 02:02:16,000
..an soul has attained
peace by killing its enemy.

1168
02:02:16,333 --> 02:02:17,375
You go away!

1169
02:02:17,875 --> 02:02:19,500
Leave Radha's body and go away.

1170
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:23,458
Put aside your anger which
is a doorway to hell and find peace.

1171
02:02:23,792 --> 02:02:27,833
If my vengeance is not fulfilled,
my soul will not find peace matha ji.

1172
02:02:27,917 --> 02:02:30,667
My revenge will not be
satisfied with your words.

1173
02:02:30,750 --> 02:02:33,962
I'll not leave Radha's
body without killing that fellow.

1174
02:02:34,042 --> 02:02:39,417
Pramila, soul should seek
peace and go away to upper worlds.

1175
02:02:39,583 --> 02:02:41,542
It shouldn't become a
reason for distress like this.

1176
02:02:41,750 --> 02:02:45,689
I meditated all these
days and acquired power to..

1177
02:02:45,769 --> 02:02:49,875
..kill that fellow,
but not to get scared of you.

1178
02:02:50,833 --> 02:02:51,875
Hail to Lord Shankar!

1179
02:02:59,458 --> 02:03:00,292
Radha!

1180
02:03:07,500 --> 02:03:09,500
I need that body!

1181
02:03:23,042 --> 02:03:28,583
This Radha, who helped you up until now,
will forget about your past from now on.

1182
02:03:30,542 --> 02:03:34,750
Once she gains consciousness, she
would have forgotten everything about you!

1183
02:03:43,250 --> 02:03:46,917
Pramila, give up your futile efforts.

1184
02:03:47,292 --> 02:03:49,333
You can't do anything
to anyone from now on.

1185
02:03:49,542 --> 02:03:50,333
Seek peace.

1186
02:03:50,417 --> 02:03:51,986
People who have died
will have to be born..

1187
02:03:52,066 --> 02:03:54,083
..and people who are born have to die.
That's for sure!

1188
02:03:54,167 --> 02:03:56,417
Your soul has to go back to higher worlds.

1189
02:03:56,708 --> 02:03:58,500
You have one more janmaa.

1190
02:03:58,833 --> 02:04:02,708
Don't distress your
soul with vengeful thoughts.

1191
02:04:03,292 --> 02:04:07,583
That God will give them the
correct punishment for their sins.

1192
02:04:08,083 --> 02:04:09,792
Go back peacefully!

1193
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,875
We can't escape the result
of our deeds, Pramila.

1194
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:19,000
We all are the pawns in that
world drama that Shiva is playing out.

1195
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:24,425
We have to fulfil our dharma,
but shouldn't betray ourselves..

1196
02:04:24,505 --> 02:04:26,458
..with thoughts of revenge. Cry!

1197
02:04:32,125 --> 02:04:37,542
Make your anger come
out of you through tears.

1198
02:05:29,375 --> 02:05:31,125
Now your Radha is safe.

1199
02:05:31,667 --> 02:05:36,667
You both get married happily
and have kids and lead a peaceful life!

1200
02:06:03,208 --> 02:06:03,958
Radha..

1201
02:06:07,500 --> 02:06:08,208
..have it!

1202
02:06:19,542 --> 02:06:21,333
I kept my word that I
had promised to your father.

1203
02:06:22,083 --> 02:06:23,000
What was that?

1204
02:06:24,708 --> 02:06:25,542
I mean.

1205
02:06:26,667 --> 02:06:28,542
I told him that I'll
take good care of you.

1206
02:06:28,833 --> 02:06:30,083
I was thinking about it.

1207
02:06:46,333 --> 02:06:47,625
He is still alive!

1208
02:07:02,292 --> 02:07:04,083
Where have you gone away, Pramila?

1209
02:07:04,875 --> 02:07:07,208
You've left without taking your revenge!

1210
02:07:07,792 --> 02:07:09,583
How is it going to be satisfied?
