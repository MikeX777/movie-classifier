1
00:00:45,798 --> 00:00:48,764
Graduation

2
00:02:50,631 --> 00:02:51,842
What happened?

3
00:02:52,049 --> 00:02:54,137
Someone threw a stone.

4
00:02:54,677 --> 00:02:56,563
- Did you see who?
- No.

5
00:02:57,722 --> 00:02:58,849
Weird.

6
00:02:59,056 --> 00:02:59,769
Indeed.

7
00:03:01,392 --> 00:03:02,603
<i>Hows Mum'?

8
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,068
She's got a headache.

9
00:03:04,395 --> 00:03:06,198
There's water boiling here.

10
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,616
It's for her steam remedy.

11
00:03:08,983 --> 00:03:10,537
Hurry up, it's late.

12
00:03:10,735 --> 00:03:11,660
Yes.

13
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,119
- We're nearly out of toothpaste.
- OK.

14
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:19,630
- Bye, Mum.
- Bye, love.

15
00:03:21,162 --> 00:03:23,084
- I got your lunch.
- Thanks.

16
00:03:24,957 --> 00:03:26,962
Are you OK? Need anything?

17
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,134
No.

18
00:03:28,544 --> 00:03:30,514
I brought the hot water in.

19
00:03:30,713 --> 00:03:32,101
On the table?

20
00:03:32,298 --> 00:03:33,852
I put a cloth under it.

21
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:36,221
Any idea who broke our window?

22
00:03:36,427 --> 00:03:37,222
No.

23
00:03:38,596 --> 00:03:40,731
- I'll be outside.
- OK.

24
00:03:40,932 --> 00:03:44,728
- My God, who'd do...
- Magda, I'm off, it's late.

25
00:03:46,729 --> 00:03:47,690
Bye.

26
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,635
- Did you make the bookings?
- Yes.

27
00:04:14,924 --> 00:04:16,181
For what date?

28
00:04:16,384 --> 00:04:17,262
The 24th.

29
00:04:17,468 --> 00:04:18,856
Isn't that too late?

30
00:04:19,345 --> 00:04:22,109
Classes start
on the 1st of October there.

31
00:04:22,306 --> 00:04:24,857
Could we get you settled in 6 days?

32
00:04:25,184 --> 00:04:25,861
Yes.

33
00:04:30,106 --> 00:04:30,984
What is it?

34
00:04:34,443 --> 00:04:36,947
Nothing.
Just thinking about leaving.

35
00:04:37,154 --> 00:04:39,835
Thinking?
You should be glad.

36
00:04:40,116 --> 00:04:42,584
If I were your age now...

37
00:04:45,746 --> 00:04:48,250
I'm thinking of my friends.

38
00:04:48,457 --> 00:04:51,222
Friends!
You'll make new ones there.

39
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:52,261
Right.

40
00:04:53,421 --> 00:04:55,722
You can't stay here for friends!

41
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:58,261
Do what's best for you!

42
00:04:58,467 --> 00:04:59,429
Yes.

43
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,937
Today's just revision?

44
00:05:04,181 --> 00:05:05,772
But I'm getting nervous.

45
00:05:05,975 --> 00:05:07,398
About the Romanian test?

46
00:05:07,602 --> 00:05:09,488
No. Just in general.

47
00:05:10,062 --> 00:05:12,743
Relax. You've already done
the hard bit.

48
00:05:13,482 --> 00:05:14,574
Yeah.

49
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,661
I'll meet you when you're done?

50
00:05:23,409 --> 00:05:25,663
No, I have my motorcycle lesson.

51
00:05:26,203 --> 00:05:27,959
Marius will pick you up?

52
00:05:28,164 --> 00:05:29,089
Yes.

53
00:05:32,001 --> 00:05:33,128
Be careful.

54
00:05:34,003 --> 00:05:34,964
I will.

55
00:05:35,963 --> 00:05:38,134
Drop me here if you're in a rush.

56
00:05:38,341 --> 00:05:39,598
Is it OK?

57
00:05:39,842 --> 00:05:40,804
Sure.

58
00:05:43,888 --> 00:05:45,276
All right then.

59
00:05:46,224 --> 00:05:47,101
Bye.

60
00:05:48,351 --> 00:05:49,229
Bye.

61
00:06:39,068 --> 00:06:41,785
This little one's almost
faded away.

62
00:06:41,988 --> 00:06:44,574
You're just saying that.

63
00:06:48,786 --> 00:06:50,708
Is this the standard treatment?

64
00:06:50,913 --> 00:06:53,333
Only for females.

65
00:07:05,887 --> 00:07:07,227
They're calling you.

66
00:07:11,559 --> 00:07:12,816
Answer it.

67
00:07:15,813 --> 00:07:17,367
Please, answer it.

68
00:07:30,661 --> 00:07:31,586
Yes.

69
00:07:55,561 --> 00:07:56,273
What?

70
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,733
Somebody attacked Eliza.

71
00:07:59,523 --> 00:08:00,995
She's in hospital.

72
00:08:01,275 --> 00:08:02,533
Didn't you drive her?

73
00:08:02,735 --> 00:08:05,583
I dropped her off
across the street.

74
00:08:06,656 --> 00:08:09,835
What are you waiting for? Go!

75
00:08:10,409 --> 00:08:12,165
Go! Call me if I can help.

76
00:08:13,955 --> 00:08:15,082
Doctor!

77
00:08:21,754 --> 00:08:23,593
I'm here, doctor!

78
00:08:27,927 --> 00:08:29,564
I've talked to Pandele.

79
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,817
She seems more scared than hurt.

80
00:08:33,057 --> 00:08:34,611
Why didn't you.

81
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:37,656
Magda, please, don't start.

82
00:08:37,853 --> 00:08:39,277
Just tell me.

83
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,532
It was faster on foot!

84
00:08:41,732 --> 00:08:44,912
- Where were you?
- The other wing.

85
00:08:45,111 --> 00:08:47,994
And please, don't start.

86
00:08:48,906 --> 00:08:50,413
I'm listening, doctor.

87
00:08:51,242 --> 00:08:52,630
I'm out here with my wife.

88
00:08:55,288 --> 00:08:56,878
We'll come in then.

89
00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:00,386
Her head is fine.
Her arm's a bit hurt.

90
00:09:10,595 --> 00:09:13,442
She's a bit dazed,
I gave her a Diazepam.

91
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:17,233
We'll X-ray her arm.
She was hurt defending herself.

92
00:09:17,435 --> 00:09:19,191
It's all right now.

93
00:09:20,855 --> 00:09:26,158
File the complaint today.
There's a better chance he'll be caught.

94
00:09:26,569 --> 00:09:29,250
- Had she more than one bank card?
- No.

95
00:09:29,614 --> 00:09:31,666
- Only this.
- But her SIM card...

96
00:09:31,866 --> 00:09:33,254
Already locked.

97
00:09:33,451 --> 00:09:36,168
Thank you, Georgiana,
I owe you one.

98
00:09:37,705 --> 00:09:39,792
- Did you try her phone?
- It's off.

99
00:09:39,999 --> 00:09:41,292
Thanks, Csilla.

100
00:09:41,542 --> 00:09:44,259
Shall I call your friend
in the police?

101
00:09:44,462 --> 00:09:45,304
- Ivanov.
- Yes.

102
00:09:45,504 --> 00:09:48,518
- He could take her statement.
- Call him.

103
00:09:48,716 --> 00:09:51,397
No, she must see photos of suspects.

104
00:09:51,594 --> 00:09:54,559
And change the locks.
He took her keys too.

105
00:09:54,764 --> 00:09:56,685
Could you leave us alone?

106
00:09:56,891 --> 00:09:58,184
I'm sorry.

107
00:09:58,392 --> 00:10:00,611
Tell X-ray we're on our way.

108
00:10:26,837 --> 00:10:29,602
She sprained her wrist
defending herself.

109
00:10:31,175 --> 00:10:34,687
Gynecology confirmed there are
no traces of semen.

110
00:10:34,887 --> 00:10:37,272
The bastard
didn't get an erection.

111
00:10:37,473 --> 00:10:38,861
How do you know?

112
00:10:39,058 --> 00:10:40,612
Eliza told us.

113
00:10:41,143 --> 00:10:44,821
It didn't seem like
she lost her virginity recently,

114
00:10:45,022 --> 00:10:47,277
so we asked her
what happened.

115
00:10:50,903 --> 00:10:53,584
Sorry but I thought
you should know.

116
00:10:53,781 --> 00:10:55,074
Of course.

117
00:10:57,577 --> 00:10:59,831
It's OK,
given the circumstances.

118
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,464
- It could have been worse.
- Sure.

119
00:11:04,834 --> 00:11:06,471
- I'll be off.
- Thank you.

120
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,299
No.

121
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:12,560
No.

122
00:11:15,094 --> 00:11:16,019
No.

123
00:11:17,388 --> 00:11:18,313
No.

124
00:11:19,599 --> 00:11:23,027
That's all the rapists we have.
What now, sir?

125
00:11:23,227 --> 00:11:24,817
<i>Ga“ Gem fox (he sketch.

126
00:11:25,021 --> 00:11:26,741
He's on his way.

127
00:11:27,815 --> 00:11:29,701
- Take her statement.
- Yes.

128
00:11:31,777 --> 00:11:35,206
- On his way here or to his girl?
- I didn't ask.

129
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:37,082
Here.

130
00:11:37,909 --> 00:11:39,332
And a pen.

131
00:11:39,619 --> 00:11:41,421
Now write this...

132
00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:45,293
I, the undersigned,
residing at...

133
00:11:46,167 --> 00:11:47,377
Can I get you a coffee?

134
00:11:47,585 --> 00:11:49,471
I've had <i>3</i> already.

135
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:52,435
- A bit much for a doctor?
- Right...

136
00:11:52,632 --> 00:11:56,226
Hereby declare that,
and write the date and time...

137
00:11:56,469 --> 00:11:59,482
It was 7:54. I had a call just then.

138
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,560
At 1:54, in the area
between Republic Street and...

139
00:12:03,768 --> 00:12:05,109
Piscului.

140
00:12:06,812 --> 00:12:08,948
Crossing a construction site...

141
00:12:09,148 --> 00:12:10,489
To school.

142
00:12:10,691 --> 00:12:12,032
Let her do this.

143
00:12:12,944 --> 00:12:16,740
I was approached by a man,
and we'll describe him...

144
00:12:17,114 --> 00:12:19,451
They've been building there forever.

145
00:12:19,659 --> 00:12:21,628
A backroom deal?

146
00:12:21,827 --> 00:12:23,500
Isn't it always?

147
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,299
So, I was approached by a man...

148
00:12:26,499 --> 00:12:30,722
Who put a knife to my throat...

149
00:12:31,587 --> 00:12:33,675
Did he say anything before?

150
00:12:33,881 --> 00:12:34,676
No.

151
00:12:35,383 --> 00:12:38,930
...and he threatened me, saying...

152
00:12:39,428 --> 00:12:42,525
...that he would kill me...

153
00:12:44,684 --> 00:12:46,938
if I refused to have

154
00:12:47,144 --> 00:12:49,730
sexual intercourse with him.

155
00:12:50,106 --> 00:12:52,692
Why did we abolish
the death sentence?

156
00:12:54,652 --> 00:12:56,871
He came up to you on the site?

157
00:12:57,071 --> 00:12:58,578
On the sidewalk.

158
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,079
So he pulled you in there?

159
00:13:01,284 --> 00:13:02,292
Yes.

160
00:13:02,785 --> 00:13:04,506
Were there people around?

161
00:13:05,955 --> 00:13:07,248
I think so.

162
00:13:07,748 --> 00:13:09,338
Didn't they notice?

163
00:13:10,668 --> 00:13:12,139
I don't know.

164
00:13:12,545 --> 00:13:14,680
Did you scream or anything?

165
00:13:15,089 --> 00:13:18,886
No, he put his hand over my mouth
right away.

166
00:13:19,677 --> 00:13:22,227
So he pulled you behind a wall?

167
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:24,982
There was a container.

168
00:13:25,266 --> 00:13:27,401
And he pulled his trousers down?

169
00:13:28,352 --> 00:13:31,734
He pulled his trousers down...

170
00:13:32,189 --> 00:13:33,696
and he pulled me to him.

171
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,869
Let's get out for a bit.

172
00:13:36,235 --> 00:13:39,284
- It's fine, you can stay.
- No, we're going.

173
00:13:39,488 --> 00:13:40,580
Are you OK?

174
00:13:41,157 --> 00:13:43,956
Come on, she's a grown-up!

175
00:13:53,502 --> 00:13:55,258
Don't worry, we'll get him.

176
00:13:55,796 --> 00:13:58,217
You think that's what I care about?

177
00:13:58,716 --> 00:14:00,721
I know but it's all we can do.

178
00:14:01,677 --> 00:14:04,607
She starts university in the UK
in September.

179
00:14:04,805 --> 00:14:05,814
Great.

180
00:14:06,182 --> 00:14:08,768
Two universities offered her
scholarships.

181
00:14:08,976 --> 00:14:11,562
- Impressive! What field?
- Psychology.

182
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:15,160
- She's a hard worker, my girl.
- I can imagine.

183
00:14:16,025 --> 00:14:18,030
But she needs to pass her finals.

184
00:14:18,277 --> 00:14:21,077
Finals!
It's good she's got a scholarship.

185
00:14:21,322 --> 00:14:23,125
It depends on her final grades.

186
00:14:23,366 --> 00:14:26,960
- Stuff like this happens.
- Around here, it does!

187
00:14:27,161 --> 00:14:29,712
- It happens there too...
- Not so much.

188
00:14:30,498 --> 00:14:33,001
They're more civilised, more...

189
00:14:33,251 --> 00:14:34,757
She was all set to leave...

190
00:14:34,961 --> 00:14:37,429
Sure. What would she stay here for?

191
00:14:37,964 --> 00:14:40,644
- Were the tests in English?
- All of them.

192
00:14:41,133 --> 00:14:43,719
Private tutoring since 5th grade...

193
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:46,188
A great English teacher at school...

194
00:14:46,472 --> 00:14:50,434
You know her. She was in that accident
at the bridge...

195
00:14:50,768 --> 00:14:53,069
A year ago.

196
00:14:53,312 --> 00:14:54,486
The one with the child!

197
00:14:56,232 --> 00:14:57,988
Your girl has her finals, too...

198
00:14:58,192 --> 00:15:00,244
Yes. Top grades in chemistry.

199
00:15:00,444 --> 00:15:01,322
Congratulations!

200
00:15:01,529 --> 00:15:03,451
I'll get her a job with us.

201
00:15:03,906 --> 00:15:05,117
Do you see her often?

202
00:15:05,533 --> 00:15:08,416
She calls me
when I'm late with the alimony.

203
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,211
How's Oana?

204
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:12,586
She moved to Sebes.

205
00:15:12,957 --> 00:15:15,638
She met a guy with three children.

206
00:15:15,835 --> 00:15:17,388
She's got so fat-

207
00:15:17,587 --> 00:15:18,974
- No!
- Oh yes.

208
00:15:19,171 --> 00:15:21,971
- Sir?
- Quickly. Do the sketch.

209
00:15:22,174 --> 00:15:23,099
<i>On my 'NW-

210
00:15:23,301 --> 00:15:27,097
Gelu's an artist,
Romeo's a doctor in our hospital.

211
00:15:27,305 --> 00:15:31,231
Really? Could he maybe
put in a word for my godfather?

212
00:15:31,475 --> 00:15:32,947
<i>Remember Bum'?

213
00:15:33,144 --> 00:15:34,437
- I'll be going.
- Go.

214
00:15:35,062 --> 00:15:37,317
He got us out of military service.
At 18.

215
00:15:37,523 --> 00:15:40,537
- Ex-head of customs?
- He's deputy mayor now.

216
00:15:40,735 --> 00:15:41,992
What about him?

217
00:15:42,194 --> 00:15:46,157
He has cirrhosis or something.
He urgently needs a liver.

218
00:15:47,241 --> 00:15:48,712
I don't know...

219
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:52,338
For transplants,
there's a national waiting list.

220
00:15:52,872 --> 00:15:55,256
But I talked to Tiberiu in Bucharest.

221
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:58,305
He's working in
the Ministry of Health now.

222
00:15:58,502 --> 00:16:00,093
- Boghean?
- Precisely.

223
00:16:00,296 --> 00:16:01,138
I know him.

224
00:16:01,339 --> 00:16:05,598
He promised to help.
Bulai has always helped everybody.

225
00:16:05,801 --> 00:16:07,308
Always helpful and kind.

226
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:09,391
So what am I supposed to do?

227
00:16:09,555 --> 00:16:12,521
Call Boghean to bump
his name up the list.

228
00:16:14,393 --> 00:16:15,900
I know, but...

229
00:16:16,103 --> 00:16:19,236
He'll die if we don't.
He helped everybody.

230
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,863
Please.

231
00:16:21,359 --> 00:16:23,446
- I'll see what I can do.
- Sir?

232
00:16:24,195 --> 00:16:27,541
He looks like the convict
who escaped yesterday.

233
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:30,749
Given how you've drawn him...

234
00:16:30,952 --> 00:16:32,505
She doesn't remember.

235
00:16:32,703 --> 00:16:34,459
Go and do it properly.

236
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,301
What?

237
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,935
I keep wondering
who broke our window.

238
00:16:49,929 --> 00:16:53,607
Who knows?
There are all kinds of people.

239
00:16:54,475 --> 00:16:55,686
Still, it's strange.

240
00:16:55,893 --> 00:16:57,186
Watch out!

241
00:17:00,064 --> 00:17:01,238
Are you all right?

242
00:17:01,649 --> 00:17:02,491
Yes.

243
00:17:28,593 --> 00:17:29,684
What was it?

244
00:17:30,636 --> 00:17:32,024
A dog, I guess.

245
00:17:42,773 --> 00:17:44,613
Here's the old lock.

246
00:17:44,859 --> 00:17:47,908
Call me when you decide
about the grille.

247
00:17:48,154 --> 00:17:49,542
I'll talk to my wife.

248
00:17:49,739 --> 00:17:52,373
Bars are safer
for the ground floor.

249
00:17:52,575 --> 00:17:53,667
Of course.

250
00:17:53,826 --> 00:17:54,704
Thank you.

251
00:17:54,952 --> 00:17:57,004
- Call me.
- Yes.

252
00:17:57,204 --> 00:17:58,960
I'm done, goodbye!

253
00:17:59,165 --> 00:18:00,422
Goodbye.

254
00:18:01,792 --> 00:18:04,260
- My best to your daughter.
- Thank you.

255
00:18:04,462 --> 00:18:07,475
I had a cousin who got raped
For years she-

256
00:18:07,673 --> 00:18:08,847
No...

257
00:18:09,634 --> 00:18:12,813
No, my girl wasn't raped,
Just assaulted.

258
00:18:13,971 --> 00:18:15,063
Goodbye then.

259
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,454
How is she?

260
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:58,044
How do you think?

261
00:20:01,162 --> 00:20:02,289
Magda...

262
00:20:04,206 --> 00:20:06,425
Did you know Eliza
isn't a virgin?

263
00:20:07,877 --> 00:20:09,549
I had an idea.

264
00:20:10,755 --> 00:20:12,345
Why didn't you tell me?

265
00:20:13,507 --> 00:20:17,138
It's personal,
you don't just talk about it.

266
00:20:17,428 --> 00:20:19,480
So how did you know?

267
00:20:20,514 --> 00:20:22,520
Because I'm her mother.

268
00:20:23,643 --> 00:20:28,483
Magda, we agreed that
when it comes to Eliza, we talk.

269
00:20:28,981 --> 00:20:30,571
I didn't hide anything.

270
00:20:30,775 --> 00:20:35,615
Maybe she doesn't want
to talk about this with you.

271
00:20:36,447 --> 00:20:38,784
She can discuss anything with me.

272
00:20:41,494 --> 00:20:43,499
Why didn't she then?

273
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:45,374
I don't know.

274
00:20:46,832 --> 00:20:48,838
Maybe you told her not to?

275
00:20:49,043 --> 00:20:51,677
I thought we had a real talk.

276
00:20:53,965 --> 00:20:55,092
Do you like

277
00:20:55,967 --> 00:20:59,265
this motorcycle instructor
she hangs out with?

278
00:20:59,428 --> 00:21:02,477
Whether I do or not,
it's her business now.

279
00:21:02,682 --> 00:21:07,071
Encourage her to date a guy
who sells used cars from Germany!

280
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:09,156
He doesn't sell them.

281
00:21:09,355 --> 00:21:12,404
He just brought over
a bike for himself.

282
00:21:12,608 --> 00:21:13,570
Yes, right.

283
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:16,364
Want me to pick her boyfriends?

284
00:21:16,571 --> 00:21:18,161
Let her experience life.

285
00:21:18,364 --> 00:21:23,288
Nowadays you don't have to marry
the first guy you hold hands with.

286
00:21:23,494 --> 00:21:26,591
As if I was
the first you held hands with.

287
00:21:26,956 --> 00:21:29,720
Relax, I wasn't thinking of you.

288
00:21:30,501 --> 00:21:33,301
Not everything's about you,
you know.

289
00:21:35,881 --> 00:21:38,100
I'll pack her school lunch.

290
00:21:38,593 --> 00:21:41,096
Should she sit the exam tomorrow?

291
00:21:41,387 --> 00:21:42,858
Of course.

292
00:21:43,472 --> 00:21:46,936
You think this is something
you just shake oft?

293
00:21:47,143 --> 00:21:50,939
Magda! Her scholarship depends on it!
Be responsible!

294
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:55,573
I am, but it's not like
today didn't happen. It happened.

295
00:21:55,776 --> 00:21:59,620
She can't throw away
all her work because of an accident.

296
00:21:59,822 --> 00:22:02,326
Accident?
So rape is an accident?

297
00:22:02,533 --> 00:22:05,997
He didn't rape her!
Stop saying that, all of you!

298
00:22:06,203 --> 00:22:07,710
He just forced his head...

299
00:22:07,914 --> 00:22:08,708
Stop it!

300
00:22:08,915 --> 00:22:11,632
She'll sit the exam,
and that's final!

301
00:22:22,053 --> 00:22:24,224
It's time to let her decide.

302
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:28,061
I will. And she'll agree,
you'll see.

303
00:22:28,267 --> 00:22:29,904
Just don't meddle.

304
00:22:30,895 --> 00:22:32,817
Could you two keep it down?

305
00:22:33,773 --> 00:22:35,825
Where are your socks?

306
00:22:39,445 --> 00:22:40,656
Eliza.

307
00:22:41,614 --> 00:22:45,410
Tomorrow I'll see
if we can postpone the exam.

308
00:22:45,826 --> 00:22:49,338
But if we can't,
you have to do your best.

309
00:22:50,456 --> 00:22:52,461
I don't know if I can write.

310
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:56,511
Everybody will be nice to you.
They'll understand.

311
00:23:02,218 --> 00:23:04,270
I'm going to bed now.

312
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:49,224
Excuse me, madam!

313
00:25:49,594 --> 00:25:50,768
Madam!

314
00:25:52,638 --> 00:25:53,812
Good morning.

315
00:25:54,098 --> 00:25:57,277
I have to talk to an exam supervisor.

316
00:25:57,518 --> 00:25:59,404
But the guards here claim...

317
00:25:59,604 --> 00:26:02,902
- Parents are not allowed.
- It's fine, don't worry.

318
00:26:03,107 --> 00:26:05,408
There are rules-

319
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:09,073
Don't worry, I'll handle it!

320
00:26:14,201 --> 00:26:17,416
Doctor,
I agree it's a prestigious university,

321
00:26:17,622 --> 00:26:19,923
but the regulations state that-

322
00:26:20,124 --> 00:26:23,339
Mr. President.
Do they state "no casts allowed"?

323
00:26:23,586 --> 00:26:26,386
We have to rule out
all possible fraud.

324
00:26:26,589 --> 00:26:29,436
Her final high school average was 9.5!

325
00:26:29,634 --> 00:26:34,640
Yes but last year we had a good student
with notes in his plaster.

326
00:26:34,847 --> 00:26:37,351
Isn't it a case-by-case decision?

327
00:26:37,558 --> 00:26:39,610
Yes, but the procedure-

328
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:42,528
She was attacked
in front of the school!

329
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:45,530
Not in the school
so it's not our fault!

330
00:26:45,733 --> 00:26:47,820
It's never the school's fault, is it?

331
00:26:48,027 --> 00:26:51,491
Doctor, we're deeply sorry,
but the rules-

332
00:26:51,739 --> 00:26:54,587
Please just allow her to sit the exam!

333
00:26:54,784 --> 00:26:57,963
Let the board decide
if she's to be disqualified.

334
00:26:58,246 --> 00:27:00,416
But please give her a chance!

335
00:27:01,749 --> 00:27:05,546
Send her in.
And let's hope we get no complaints.

336
00:27:05,753 --> 00:27:09,550
You won't.
Thank you, I'm in your debt.

337
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,143
Let's go.

338
00:28:11,193 --> 00:28:14,123
- Did you bring my results?
- There.

339
00:28:14,822 --> 00:28:18,286
They changed your medication.
You're on Cavinton now.

340
00:28:19,493 --> 00:28:21,581
For a month, then we'll see.

341
00:28:23,664 --> 00:28:24,542
Wait...

342
00:28:25,958 --> 00:28:27,346
There's a page missing?

343
00:28:27,543 --> 00:28:31,600
Really, Mum, don't you trust me?

344
00:28:33,007 --> 00:28:35,427
Here. Take this when you go.

345
00:28:35,635 --> 00:28:36,726
What's this?

346
00:28:37,053 --> 00:28:40,399
The photo album.
I found it in the cabinet.

347
00:28:41,265 --> 00:28:42,986
Don't you want to keep it?

348
00:28:43,309 --> 00:28:45,396
Eliza may want it, when she leaves.

349
00:28:45,728 --> 00:28:47,448
There are photos of her.

350
00:28:49,106 --> 00:28:50,150
Fine.

351
00:28:51,442 --> 00:28:54,788
But calm down,
Pandele told you to rest.

352
00:28:54,987 --> 00:28:57,039
You turned the house upside down.

353
00:28:57,239 --> 00:29:00,288
Because I forgot where it was,
that's why.

354
00:29:01,702 --> 00:29:02,960
Fine, fine.

355
00:29:03,287 --> 00:29:05,968
Eliza said she'd stop by, yesterday,

356
00:29:06,165 --> 00:29:08,301
to take up her party dress.

357
00:29:08,751 --> 00:29:12,844
Mum, she's busy with the exams,
with going away...

358
00:29:15,549 --> 00:29:18,515
Don't open for anyone,
some convicts escaped.

359
00:29:18,761 --> 00:29:20,517
It was on the radio.

360
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:26,530
I don't agree with her leaving,
not one bit.

361
00:29:26,769 --> 00:29:28,323
So what should we do?

362
00:29:29,272 --> 00:29:30,909
You say that now,

363
00:29:31,107 --> 00:29:34,903
but do you know the feeling,
when your child leaves?

364
00:29:35,444 --> 00:29:38,374
I understand, Mum,
but it's for her sake.

365
00:29:38,572 --> 00:29:40,993
What if she studied here in Cluj?

366
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,751
What's there for her here, Mum?

367
00:29:43,953 --> 00:29:45,460
What's so terrible about here?

368
00:29:45,663 --> 00:29:47,585
She has her home,

369
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:51,551
she has you.
She'd be nearby, you'd have each other.

370
00:29:52,128 --> 00:29:55,011
Everything is difficult here,
you need to-

371
00:29:55,256 --> 00:29:58,020
Do you think
it's any different elsewhere?

372
00:29:59,176 --> 00:30:03,483
She should stay and change things!
If they all leave...

373
00:30:03,681 --> 00:30:07,228
We stayed and what did we change,
in the end?

374
00:30:07,935 --> 00:30:10,403
You changed what could be changed.

375
00:30:10,605 --> 00:30:13,025
There, you don't need connections.

376
00:30:13,232 --> 00:30:15,569
She's not the type to tough it out.

377
00:30:15,776 --> 00:30:17,497
And after we're gone...

378
00:30:18,571 --> 00:30:23,080
It's because you babied her.
She's never had to face trouble.

379
00:30:23,284 --> 00:30:25,965
We had our own share of trouble
already.

380
00:30:26,412 --> 00:30:28,132
I should go now.

381
00:30:28,331 --> 00:30:29,754
Anything else you need?

382
00:30:29,957 --> 00:30:33,303
I told you before, but you forgot.

383
00:30:33,502 --> 00:30:34,464
What?

384
00:30:35,546 --> 00:30:38,310
Clear the grass from the grave.

385
00:30:38,758 --> 00:30:42,020
And pour some concrete,
it's cleaner.

386
00:30:42,219 --> 00:30:43,560
Really, Mum...

387
00:30:43,763 --> 00:30:45,850
Please, do it for me.

388
00:30:46,933 --> 00:30:48,735
I can't do it myself anymore.

389
00:30:49,101 --> 00:30:50,774
Fine, I'll see.

390
00:30:51,896 --> 00:30:53,403
You said that already.

391
00:30:53,648 --> 00:30:55,487
I won't forget. Bye.

392
00:30:55,733 --> 00:30:57,204
Take care.

393
00:31:00,947 --> 00:31:02,418
- Lock the door!
- I will.

394
00:31:26,222 --> 00:31:27,432
How is Eliza doing?

395
00:31:27,932 --> 00:31:29,059
So-so.

396
00:31:30,142 --> 00:31:31,779
Thanks for this morning.

397
00:31:31,978 --> 00:31:33,780
That guy's an idiot.

398
00:31:34,563 --> 00:31:36,403
Good thing it worked out.

399
00:31:36,983 --> 00:31:38,988
For her scholarship, she needs...

400
00:31:39,193 --> 00:31:41,329
At least a 9. On average.

401
00:31:45,199 --> 00:31:46,410
This is so stupid.

402
00:31:53,791 --> 00:31:54,669
What?

403
00:31:55,835 --> 00:31:56,796
Nothing.

404
00:31:57,837 --> 00:31:59,178
Tell me.

405
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:04,270
It's nothing.
My period is 6 days late.

406
00:32:10,266 --> 00:32:11,654
Why that face?

407
00:32:12,435 --> 00:32:13,692
What face?

408
00:32:14,478 --> 00:32:15,440
That one.

409
00:32:16,397 --> 00:32:17,785
I wasn't expecting it.

410
00:32:22,194 --> 00:32:24,081
Why not?

411
00:32:25,156 --> 00:32:27,042
Shall we talk now?

412
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,787
You seem a bit tense.

413
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:35,008
Good thing you're so calm.

414
00:32:36,334 --> 00:32:37,544
Isn't that Matei?

415
00:32:39,462 --> 00:32:40,636
Yes.

416
00:32:41,255 --> 00:32:43,260
I couldn't leave him home alone.

417
00:32:43,466 --> 00:32:44,509
I'll be off.

418
00:33:07,573 --> 00:33:08,961
Yes, Magda.

419
00:33:09,533 --> 00:33:11,835
She's out, she's with me.

420
00:33:12,912 --> 00:33:14,715
She just got out.

421
00:33:16,249 --> 00:33:19,214
She did well
on what she could finish.

422
00:33:19,418 --> 00:33:21,720
She didn't do the last two questions.

423
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:23,971
No, not at all.

424
00:33:25,091 --> 00:33:26,977
She just didn't have time.

425
00:33:28,511 --> 00:33:30,314
You can talk to her at home.

426
00:33:33,057 --> 00:33:34,445
Would you talk to Mum?

427
00:33:40,815 --> 00:33:42,950
Mum, I'll call you later, OK?

428
00:33:44,652 --> 00:33:46,242
No, nothing hurts.

429
00:33:48,489 --> 00:33:50,079
I knew the answers but...

430
00:33:50,741 --> 00:33:51,833
I don't know.

431
00:33:53,327 --> 00:33:55,048
No, that wasn't it.

432
00:33:59,041 --> 00:34:01,924
I call you a bit later, Mum,
OK?

433
00:34:04,714 --> 00:34:07,644
Calm down,
it's not the end of the world.

434
00:34:08,926 --> 00:34:10,729
We'll manage, don't worry.

435
00:34:14,098 --> 00:34:15,688
Shall I drive you home?

436
00:34:15,933 --> 00:34:17,570
No, I'm meeting Marius.

437
00:34:18,769 --> 00:34:20,359
Is that a good idea?

438
00:34:20,855 --> 00:34:22,527
I promised.

439
00:34:36,829 --> 00:34:37,837
Thanks.

440
00:34:44,587 --> 00:34:45,844
Sandu!

441
00:34:46,255 --> 00:34:47,299
<i>Yes, I“?

442
00:34:47,506 --> 00:34:49,843
- The doctor's here.
- I'm coming.

443
00:34:52,136 --> 00:34:53,643
What are these for?

444
00:34:54,555 --> 00:34:56,394
I had this breakdown...

445
00:34:56,599 --> 00:34:57,940
Because of the divorce?

446
00:34:59,143 --> 00:35:00,733
Maybe.
No idea.

447
00:35:00,937 --> 00:35:03,902
I panicked.
I'd made a mess of my life...

448
00:35:04,106 --> 00:35:05,578
I'd wasted it...

449
00:35:05,983 --> 00:35:10,373
So I went to a doctor
who told me to get these marbles.

450
00:35:10,947 --> 00:35:14,293
Here's one for each day I've lived

451
00:35:14,492 --> 00:35:15,915
and here, there's one

452
00:35:16,285 --> 00:35:19,631
for each day until I retire,

453
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:22,714
at 65,
unless they change the law again.

454
00:35:23,125 --> 00:35:27,218
So every evening I move one marble
and think a bit.

455
00:35:27,546 --> 00:35:29,516
Was he a doctor or a priest?

456
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:33,269
A doctor but you know,
that kind of doctor...

457
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:36,309
The marking scheme for Romanian.

458
00:35:36,681 --> 00:35:38,567
Well done, Sandu!

459
00:35:38,933 --> 00:35:40,736
- One more task.
- Please.

460
00:35:40,935 --> 00:35:45,823
The good doctor here noticed
a surveillance camera at the comer.

461
00:35:46,023 --> 00:35:47,316
- By the school?
- Yes.

462
00:35:47,525 --> 00:35:49,779
Solved. The recording comes today.

463
00:35:49,986 --> 00:35:51,409
Bravo, Sandu.

464
00:35:52,238 --> 00:35:54,160
- Anything else?
- That's all.

465
00:35:54,365 --> 00:35:55,243
Thank you, sir.

466
00:35:59,996 --> 00:36:01,383
Let's see...

467
00:36:02,415 --> 00:36:06,092
3.2 for the character description.

468
00:36:06,294 --> 00:36:10,220
2.5 for the vocabulary section...
say 2, she didn't finish it...

469
00:36:10,548 --> 00:36:12,683
1.5 for the predicative clause...

470
00:36:12,883 --> 00:36:15,469
My daughter will get a 1,
and Eliza...

471
00:36:15,678 --> 00:36:18,478
- Minus the last 2 questions.
- 8...

472
00:36:20,558 --> 00:36:23,607
- It's the right breakdown?
- Certainly.

473
00:36:24,687 --> 00:36:25,814
Not good, then.

474
00:36:26,022 --> 00:36:28,786
She'd need straight tens
in the next tests.

475
00:36:28,983 --> 00:36:30,620
I believe she can do it.

476
00:36:32,737 --> 00:36:34,706
The September session, maybe?

477
00:36:35,197 --> 00:36:37,203
Too late, I checked.

478
00:36:38,576 --> 00:36:41,375
- You should talk to Bulai.
- About what?

479
00:36:41,746 --> 00:36:43,087
You called about his liver?

480
00:36:43,289 --> 00:36:45,341
Boghean called me yesterday.

481
00:36:45,541 --> 00:36:48,127
Even better. Ask Bulai.
He can help.

482
00:36:48,294 --> 00:36:50,548
What can he do about this?

483
00:36:50,963 --> 00:36:52,351
Want me to call him?

484
00:36:53,049 --> 00:36:54,259
I'll do it.

485
00:37:05,478 --> 00:37:08,242
Hello, sir! How are you doing?

486
00:37:09,941 --> 00:37:13,073
Also busy.
My daughter's doing her final exams.

487
00:37:13,444 --> 00:37:14,867
Yes, thank you.

488
00:37:15,279 --> 00:37:17,616
I have news.
Good news, hopefully.

489
00:37:17,907 --> 00:37:21,253
My friend put in a word
about the transplant.

490
00:37:21,452 --> 00:37:23,374
And we're hoping...

491
00:37:23,621 --> 00:37:25,341
for a positive answer.

492
00:37:26,791 --> 00:37:29,638
It might take a while.
They need a donor first...

493
00:37:30,294 --> 00:37:32,595
Of course we'll let you know,

494
00:37:32,797 --> 00:37:34,387
the good Lord willing.

495
00:37:34,632 --> 00:37:36,103
I have a question, sir.

496
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:40,310
Could you help Dr. Aldea?
He has a problem.

497
00:37:41,555 --> 00:37:45,778
His daughter narrowly escaped
being raped right by the school.

498
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:48,610
So she couldn't focus too well

499
00:37:48,813 --> 00:37:51,447
for the written Romanian test today.

500
00:37:51,857 --> 00:37:55,369
She's very good,
she got a scholarship to Cambridge...

501
00:37:55,611 --> 00:37:58,328
But it depends on her results.

502
00:37:59,907 --> 00:38:02,588
He's here with me,
he can tell you more.

503
00:38:03,577 --> 00:38:05,084
Have a good day.

504
00:38:06,539 --> 00:38:08,959
He'll wait for you at 6,
in his office.

505
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,382
Romeo, it's for your child!

506
00:38:14,547 --> 00:38:15,935
Write down his number.

507
00:39:12,897 --> 00:39:12,979
- A bit more?
- I don't drink often.

508
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:15,448
- A bit more?
- I don't drink often.

509
00:39:15,733 --> 00:39:17,820
Me, I haven't touched alcohol

510
00:39:18,027 --> 00:39:20,495
for exactly a year and 6 months!

511
00:39:21,113 --> 00:39:24,708
But it's too late.
My liver still won't regenerate.

512
00:39:25,034 --> 00:39:26,457
And your test results?

513
00:39:26,661 --> 00:39:29,591
Bad. I haven't done any recently.
Got scared.

514
00:39:29,789 --> 00:39:31,082
You should do them.

515
00:39:31,707 --> 00:39:34,555
Let's get you admitted
for tests tomorrow.

516
00:39:34,752 --> 00:39:36,306
If you say so.

517
00:39:36,671 --> 00:39:41,310
A liver could show up any day,
but if you're not ready...

518
00:39:41,509 --> 00:39:44,439
You've convinced me!
See how easy it was?

519
00:39:44,804 --> 00:39:46,357
Tell me straight:

520
00:39:46,681 --> 00:39:48,353
Is it a difficult operation?

521
00:39:48,683 --> 00:39:51,945
Yes. The body needs
to accept the foreign organ.

522
00:39:52,561 --> 00:39:53,605
In other words,

523
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:56,780
the first 24 hours are crucial.

524
00:39:57,149 --> 00:39:58,656
Don't scare me.

525
00:39:59,026 --> 00:40:02,870
I won't, but you have responsibilities,
a family...

526
00:40:03,322 --> 00:40:06,419
You need to know the situation
before surgery.

527
00:40:06,617 --> 00:40:11,457
Oh, you're the kind of doctor
who tells his patient the truth.

528
00:40:11,747 --> 00:40:13,254
In your case, yes.

529
00:40:13,624 --> 00:40:16,590
In my mother's case, it's pointless.

530
00:40:16,794 --> 00:40:18,799
- What's wrong with her?
- Nothing.

531
00:40:19,505 --> 00:40:21,261
But at her age...

532
00:40:21,716 --> 00:40:23,472
So how long do you think

533
00:40:23,676 --> 00:40:26,144
we'll wait for the healthy organ?

534
00:40:26,512 --> 00:40:30,356
It can take years,
or it can happen very quickly.

535
00:40:30,641 --> 00:40:32,231
It depends on donors...

536
00:40:32,435 --> 00:40:35,532
I see.
In any case, I'm ready.

537
00:40:35,938 --> 00:40:38,074
I have my testament, the money...

538
00:40:38,274 --> 00:40:40,160
Money won't be an issue.

539
00:40:40,526 --> 00:40:44,583
Come on, doctor,
don't tell me you live off your salary!

540
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,417
That's not it.

541
00:40:47,867 --> 00:40:51,829
I hope you don't think you owe me
for helping your daughter.

542
00:40:52,038 --> 00:40:55,834
You can't compare a man's life
with some exam. An exam...

543
00:40:56,334 --> 00:40:59,845
I've called Serban,
the exam board chief.

544
00:41:00,171 --> 00:41:03,268
He understood the situation.
He's a nice man, you know...

545
00:41:03,549 --> 00:41:05,886
He came to me once with a problem.

546
00:41:06,218 --> 00:41:08,722
His wife was fired
from the town hall.

547
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:11,433
They cut jobs
while she was pregnant.

548
00:41:11,807 --> 00:41:13,398
I got her back in.

549
00:41:13,768 --> 00:41:16,900
He's been very grateful to me
ever since.

550
00:41:17,188 --> 00:41:20,700
Who'll take you on again at 43?

551
00:41:21,442 --> 00:41:23,281
People should help each other.

552
00:41:23,694 --> 00:41:27,372
My position won me many enemies,

553
00:41:27,615 --> 00:41:30,332
but also many friends!

554
00:41:31,327 --> 00:41:33,047
Could I have another drop?

555
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:36,170
Good, isn't it?

556
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:49,221
Is something wrong?

557
00:41:49,512 --> 00:41:50,686
No. Why?

558
00:41:50,888 --> 00:41:52,774
You're here? At this hour?

559
00:41:53,849 --> 00:41:56,400
I wanted to say sorry for earlier.

560
00:42:03,192 --> 00:42:04,663
The neighbors are watching.

561
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:06,284
So what?

562
00:42:07,321 --> 00:42:08,709
How's Eliza?

563
00:42:09,448 --> 00:42:10,706
Not good.

564
00:42:11,117 --> 00:42:12,410
She didn't do well.

565
00:42:12,576 --> 00:42:14,214
- On her test?
- Yes.

566
00:42:16,205 --> 00:42:17,297
I'm sorry.

567
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:18,668
Yes.

568
00:42:20,209 --> 00:42:22,095
I wanted to ask you.

569
00:42:22,545 --> 00:42:26,851
Could they let her write
a bit more once the 3 hours are up?

570
00:42:27,717 --> 00:42:29,104
Not really.

571
00:42:30,177 --> 00:42:30,972
I see.

572
00:42:32,555 --> 00:42:35,604
Well, then I don't know.
We'll see.

573
00:42:39,478 --> 00:42:40,866
<i>'Ms is Mam.

574
00:42:42,273 --> 00:42:45,073
Dr. Aldea, who operated on Mum...

575
00:42:45,651 --> 00:42:47,039
Hello, Matei.

576
00:42:48,654 --> 00:42:51,074
Matei, will you take that mask off?

577
00:42:52,658 --> 00:42:53,785
Let him be.

578
00:42:54,368 --> 00:42:55,958
I'll be going.

579
00:42:56,162 --> 00:42:57,336
Bye, Matei.

580
00:43:04,045 --> 00:43:06,381
Do you mind that I introduced you?

581
00:43:06,589 --> 00:43:08,345
No, why should I?

582
00:43:08,924 --> 00:43:10,680
You didn't want to meet him.

583
00:43:11,218 --> 00:43:12,476
You didn't want it.

584
00:43:13,971 --> 00:43:16,735
But now I thought you should meet.

585
00:43:17,266 --> 00:43:18,393
So we've met.

586
00:43:19,602 --> 00:43:21,109
I have to go.

587
00:43:22,521 --> 00:43:23,565
Go, then.

588
00:43:48,756 --> 00:43:50,642
The light attracts the moths.

589
00:43:50,841 --> 00:43:52,229
Don't worry.

590
00:43:52,426 --> 00:43:54,930
- Do you want some cake?
- No, thanks.

591
00:43:55,221 --> 00:43:56,774
Homemade, by my wife.

592
00:43:56,973 --> 00:43:59,938
I've bothered you enough already.

593
00:44:00,268 --> 00:44:01,608
It happens.

594
00:44:02,728 --> 00:44:05,113
Happy birthday to your wife.

595
00:44:05,356 --> 00:44:06,364
I'll tell her.

596
00:44:07,692 --> 00:44:10,325
- Can I get you a chair?
- Don't bother.

597
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:13,906
Forgive me for this morning.

598
00:44:14,115 --> 00:44:16,084
If I seemed a bit aggressive...

599
00:44:16,284 --> 00:44:17,671
Don't worry.

600
00:44:17,994 --> 00:44:19,963
Now, how may I help you?

601
00:44:20,621 --> 00:44:23,800
Mr. Bulai described the situation,
I believe.

602
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:25,591
Yes, he did.

603
00:44:26,168 --> 00:44:28,174
What grade does the girl need?

604
00:44:28,629 --> 00:44:30,800
She needs a final average of 9

605
00:44:31,007 --> 00:44:32,560
to get the scholarship.

606
00:44:32,967 --> 00:44:34,604
And on the Romanian test?

607
00:44:34,802 --> 00:44:36,854
We estimate an 8 at most.

608
00:44:37,388 --> 00:44:38,811
Have you spoken to anybody?

609
00:44:39,015 --> 00:44:42,692
For the Romanian test? No.
Could we change anything?

610
00:44:43,269 --> 00:44:45,404
It might be a bit late now.

611
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:49,446
There are teachers
from different schools.

612
00:44:49,734 --> 00:44:54,408
I'm very sorry to involve you.
It's very unpleasant.

613
00:44:54,614 --> 00:44:56,120
Such things happen.

614
00:44:56,407 --> 00:44:58,329
What are her grades in maths?

615
00:44:58,534 --> 00:45:02,627
Her final average
at the end of high school is 9.6.

616
00:45:02,830 --> 00:45:04,123
That's good.

617
00:45:05,291 --> 00:45:07,925
So she could get 10 in the exam.

618
00:45:08,419 --> 00:45:10,341
I think so, yes.

619
00:45:11,797 --> 00:45:14,645
I don't know one of the grading teachers.

620
00:45:14,842 --> 00:45:18,354
The other one was a colleague.
A decent man.

621
00:45:18,554 --> 00:45:20,108
But we need both of them.

622
00:45:20,264 --> 00:45:22,400
I don't know how such things work.

623
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:27,239
They must give similar grades. If not,
the paper goes to another committee.

624
00:45:27,438 --> 00:45:30,119
- It's better not to.
- I see.

625
00:45:30,441 --> 00:45:31,829
So what's best?

626
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:35,614
I'll see in the morning

627
00:45:35,947 --> 00:45:39,826
or I'll try taking the paper
to another teacher.

628
00:45:40,034 --> 00:45:42,253
But that's a bit more complicated.

629
00:45:42,662 --> 00:45:44,334
Is that the only way?

630
00:45:44,747 --> 00:45:46,633
Do you know of any other?

631
00:45:47,625 --> 00:45:50,342
Please tell me what I have to do.

632
00:45:50,753 --> 00:45:53,257
- How much I should pay.
- Nothing.

633
00:45:53,506 --> 00:45:56,305
Mr. Bulai helped me,
I help you, that's all.

634
00:45:56,509 --> 00:45:58,680
I'll be greatly in your debt.

635
00:45:59,178 --> 00:46:01,183
Could I compensate you somehow...

636
00:46:01,389 --> 00:46:04,236
Don't worry about it, it's fine.

637
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,855
Just make sure the girl

638
00:46:07,061 --> 00:46:08,817
marks her paper clearly.

639
00:46:10,189 --> 00:46:11,862
I need to talk to her?

640
00:46:12,066 --> 00:46:14,153
Yes. She must mark the paper.

641
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,697
If we miss it, it's over.

642
00:46:17,196 --> 00:46:18,323
I see.

643
00:46:19,198 --> 00:46:24,288
All she has to do is cross out
<i>3</i> words on the first page, bottom line.

644
00:46:24,537 --> 00:46:25,960
The last <i>3</i> words.

645
00:46:27,581 --> 00:46:28,709
Just like this.

646
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,054
- Understood?
- Yes.

647
00:46:35,548 --> 00:46:37,517
OK. Well, thank you.

648
00:46:37,717 --> 00:46:41,311
I'll go. I've disturbed
your wife's birthday long enough.

649
00:46:41,554 --> 00:46:44,567
Doctor, if you have any doubts,
say so now.

650
00:46:44,724 --> 00:46:47,488
This can only work on trust.

651
00:46:47,727 --> 00:46:50,989
I don't want to end up in the news.
Neither do you.

652
00:46:51,188 --> 00:46:52,909
That won't happen.

653
00:46:53,065 --> 00:46:57,288
One more thing:
I'm doing this for the girl.

654
00:46:57,570 --> 00:47:01,413
She shouldn't pay
because we can't handle our criminals.

655
00:47:02,116 --> 00:47:04,002
But I don't do such things.

656
00:47:04,619 --> 00:47:07,965
This house and all you see here
was earned honestly.

657
00:47:08,247 --> 00:47:09,421
I'm sure.

658
00:47:10,291 --> 00:47:11,762
I don't do such things.

659
00:47:11,959 --> 00:47:13,086
I don't doubt it.

660
00:47:14,879 --> 00:47:17,050
I'll see you out.
Some cake?

661
00:47:17,256 --> 00:47:18,727
No, thank you.

662
00:49:55,581 --> 00:50:00,172
Once she starts on this path,
there's no going back.

663
00:50:00,503 --> 00:50:04,346
You can't just shake it off,
say it's OK and move on.

664
00:50:04,632 --> 00:50:08,179
You know in your heart of hearts
that it's not right.

665
00:50:08,886 --> 00:50:12,149
That's not the path
I want Eliza to take in life.

666
00:50:12,348 --> 00:50:14,068
I'm sure you don't either.

667
00:50:16,811 --> 00:50:21,153
If there was any other way,
I wouldn't even think about it.

668
00:50:22,358 --> 00:50:24,577
She shouldn't be doing this.

669
00:50:26,529 --> 00:50:27,739
Magda.

670
00:50:28,656 --> 00:50:32,002
We raised her knowing
she'd leave here.

671
00:50:32,243 --> 00:50:34,295
What if she misses this chance?

672
00:50:34,495 --> 00:50:37,425
She can't handle life here.

673
00:50:38,082 --> 00:50:39,636
She'll learn.

674
00:50:40,418 --> 00:50:44,594
We were just as unprepared
at her age. We handled it.

675
00:50:44,797 --> 00:50:45,924
Did we?

676
00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:48,560
How did we handle it?

677
00:50:48,884 --> 00:50:51,768
By doing things
we wanted her not to do?

678
00:50:52,638 --> 00:50:55,521
But how could she start off in life

679
00:50:55,725 --> 00:50:58,572
with this burden on her shoulders?

680
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:00,740
What burden, Magda?

681
00:51:00,938 --> 00:51:03,026
This exam's just a formality.

682
00:51:03,232 --> 00:51:05,617
Everyone cheats in their final exam.

683
00:51:05,985 --> 00:51:07,456
I didn't cheat.

684
00:51:07,778 --> 00:51:09,748
Fine, Magda, you didn't.

685
00:51:10,323 --> 00:51:13,870
Anyway, this exam
makes no difference in the end.

686
00:51:14,118 --> 00:51:16,799
Even what they studied in school
is useless.

687
00:51:17,288 --> 00:51:20,669
All that counts is getting
to a normal world.

688
00:51:20,916 --> 00:51:24,131
How you get there matters too.

689
00:51:24,670 --> 00:51:26,343
It's not fair to-

690
00:51:26,547 --> 00:51:30,937
Being attacked in broad daylight
in a crowded place, is that fair?

691
00:51:31,344 --> 00:51:33,146
You want her to live here?

692
00:51:33,346 --> 00:51:35,849
- It was an accident.
- No, it wasn't!

693
00:51:36,307 --> 00:51:39,653
You ended up in some library
because you were fair!

694
00:51:40,019 --> 00:51:42,783
Sometimes the result
is all that matters.

695
00:51:43,147 --> 00:51:46,160
It's our decision,
she needn't feel guilty.

696
00:51:46,359 --> 00:51:49,989
This isn't something
you can decide for her.

697
00:51:50,237 --> 00:51:51,828
So what's your plan?

698
00:51:53,866 --> 00:51:55,077
I don't know.

699
00:51:55,576 --> 00:51:57,166
You know what annoys me?

700
00:51:58,329 --> 00:52:01,960
That you know
there's no other way.

701
00:52:02,166 --> 00:52:05,014
But you won't take any responsibility,

702
00:52:05,211 --> 00:52:06,931
knowing that I'll fix it.

703
00:52:07,129 --> 00:52:11,720
No, but I'm aware that being fair
comes with a price.

704
00:52:12,009 --> 00:52:13,895
And I was willing to pay it.

705
00:52:14,345 --> 00:52:18,900
You could afford to
because I took care of everything!

706
00:52:19,350 --> 00:52:22,814
I'd pay any price in this situation,
if it was about me.

707
00:52:23,229 --> 00:52:25,649
But I won't have my child pay it.

708
00:52:25,856 --> 00:52:27,447
She's my child, too.

709
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:28,736
Is she?

710
00:52:29,735 --> 00:52:31,954
Fine, then you go talk to her.

711
00:52:43,082 --> 00:52:43,960
Come in.

712
00:52:47,461 --> 00:52:49,763
Are you all right?

713
00:52:50,172 --> 00:52:53,850
Yes, just reading this synopsis.

714
00:52:57,596 --> 00:52:59,352
How did it go with Marius?

715
00:53:01,475 --> 00:53:02,603
OK.

716
00:53:03,477 --> 00:53:05,317
It'll all pass, you'll see.

717
00:53:07,481 --> 00:53:08,525
Yeah.

718
00:53:10,609 --> 00:53:13,160
When you're in Kensington Gardens,

719
00:53:13,362 --> 00:53:17,075
with all those squirrels chasing you,

720
00:53:17,742 --> 00:53:20,956
the world here will seem so far away,

721
00:53:21,162 --> 00:53:23,926
you'll wonder if it was real.

722
00:53:25,291 --> 00:53:26,501
Don't say that.

723
00:53:29,170 --> 00:53:31,305
Do you think it's easy for us?

724
00:53:32,715 --> 00:53:34,186
But that's life.

725
00:53:35,092 --> 00:53:38,889
Children leave home
and learn to live on their own.

726
00:53:41,349 --> 00:53:44,979
Don't be angry
if I don't do well in the exam tomorrow.

727
00:53:45,686 --> 00:53:46,778
Eliza,

728
00:53:48,397 --> 00:53:52,988
you have to do your best.
It'd be a pity to miss this chance.

729
00:53:55,363 --> 00:53:59,040
Some important steps in life
depend on small things.

730
00:54:00,242 --> 00:54:02,793
And some chances shouldn't be wasted.

731
00:54:04,872 --> 00:54:09,796
You know, in '91,
your Mum and I decided to move back.

732
00:54:10,086 --> 00:54:11,427
It was a bad decision.

733
00:54:12,588 --> 00:54:17,263
We thought things would change,
we thought we'd move mountains.

734
00:54:18,427 --> 00:54:20,100
We didn't move anything.

735
00:54:20,721 --> 00:54:22,608
I have no regrets, though.

736
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:24,730
At least we tried.

737
00:54:26,352 --> 00:54:29,615
But don't make a mistake now
just because we did.

738
00:54:29,814 --> 00:54:33,871
If you do, it means
we lived for nothing, understand?

739
00:54:42,702 --> 00:54:43,829
What's that?

740
00:54:46,330 --> 00:54:49,178
A precaution for tomorrow's exam.

741
00:54:50,418 --> 00:54:54,724
You need to do your best.
I'm sure this won't be necessary.

742
00:54:54,922 --> 00:54:56,761
But we can't risk

743
00:54:56,966 --> 00:55:00,228
you missing this train
for fractions of a point.

744
00:55:04,932 --> 00:55:06,439
I don't understand.

745
00:55:08,394 --> 00:55:12,535
You just have to cross out
<i>3</i> words from the first page.

746
00:55:13,065 --> 00:55:16,613
Just like here.
Regardless of the questions.

747
00:55:17,445 --> 00:55:19,035
Now do you understand?

748
00:55:23,868 --> 00:55:25,256
Eliza...

749
00:55:26,912 --> 00:55:30,376
Sometimes, in life,
it's the result that counts.

750
00:55:31,208 --> 00:55:33,214
Don't get me wrong.

751
00:55:35,087 --> 00:55:38,800
We raised you to always be honest.

752
00:55:39,717 --> 00:55:41,852
But this is the world we live in.

753
00:55:42,261 --> 00:55:46,058
And sometimes we need to fight
using their weapons.

754
00:55:47,725 --> 00:55:52,281
So this is a precaution
that gets you where you want to go,

755
00:55:52,521 --> 00:55:53,993
where you deserve to go.

756
00:55:55,358 --> 00:55:59,534
From there,
you can do what you think is best.

757
00:56:01,322 --> 00:56:03,707
- What I think is best?
- Yes.

758
00:56:04,825 --> 00:56:09,048
Trust me, if there was any way
of changing things here,

759
00:56:09,246 --> 00:56:12,046
I'd urge you to stay and fight.

760
00:56:12,875 --> 00:56:15,556
But it's enough that we stayed.

761
00:56:16,587 --> 00:56:19,684
Let others try too,
we've done our bit.

762
00:56:22,259 --> 00:56:23,731
What does Mum say?

763
00:56:25,388 --> 00:56:29,896
I think she understands
that life has its winners and losers.

764
00:56:30,893 --> 00:56:33,693
And we want you to be a winner.

765
00:56:35,064 --> 00:56:38,528
And have a good life,
since you won't get another.

766
00:56:52,873 --> 00:56:54,961
I'll let you rest now.

767
00:57:02,967 --> 00:57:05,932
Put on some socks.
Don't catch cold.

768
00:57:09,515 --> 00:57:10,856
Goodnight.

769
00:57:13,936 --> 00:57:17,033
You can smoke,
I know you have some there.

770
00:58:12,787 --> 00:58:13,712
Dad?

771
00:58:13,913 --> 00:58:14,874
Yes?

772
00:58:17,375 --> 00:58:19,711
Why do you always beep here?

773
00:58:21,504 --> 00:58:23,057
Just to make sure.

774
00:58:26,050 --> 00:58:28,470
Even when there are no cars?

775
00:58:43,401 --> 00:58:44,528
Want some water?

776
00:58:44,777 --> 00:58:45,536
No.

777
00:58:45,736 --> 00:58:47,290
Did you bring your snack?

778
00:58:47,613 --> 00:58:48,491
Yes.

779
00:58:49,281 --> 00:58:51,750
Eat. It helps the brain.

780
00:59:06,299 --> 00:59:08,635
Good luck. And take care.

781
00:59:11,470 --> 00:59:13,890
- Could you rewind?
- Of course.

782
00:59:19,270 --> 00:59:22,200
A mountain ranger
saw one of the convicts

783
00:59:22,398 --> 00:59:24,368
near the chairlift.

784
00:59:24,567 --> 00:59:26,702
Tomorrow we'll search for him.

785
00:59:28,696 --> 00:59:32,327
That cyclist says he didn't understand
what was going on.

786
00:59:34,285 --> 00:59:36,171
This other one didn't, either?

787
00:59:36,370 --> 00:59:37,842
Every man for himself.

788
00:59:38,664 --> 00:59:40,835
What's the world coming to?

789
00:59:42,043 --> 00:59:43,336
Pause it for a moment!

790
00:59:49,008 --> 00:59:51,476
Can you print me a screenshot?

791
00:59:51,969 --> 00:59:53,227
What for?

792
00:59:53,679 --> 00:59:55,067
Can you?

793
00:59:55,473 --> 00:59:58,687
Sandu, print that
for Lieutenant Bullitt here.

794
00:59:59,018 --> 01:00:00,821
Draw the blinds.

795
01:00:03,147 --> 01:00:04,155
Hello.

796
01:00:04,357 --> 01:00:06,243
- Got the convict?
- Tomorrow.

797
01:00:06,442 --> 01:00:08,245
- Heard about the accident?
- No.

798
01:00:08,444 --> 01:00:11,707
30 minutes ago, by the bridge.
Head-on collision.

799
01:00:11,906 --> 01:00:15,085
<i>3</i> men and one woman dead,
one man in a coma.

800
01:00:15,368 --> 01:00:16,709
- Were you there?
- No.

801
01:00:16,911 --> 01:00:21,716
My brother's a funeral director,
pays ambulance drivers to tip him off.

802
01:00:22,166 --> 01:00:23,293
It's come to that...

803
01:00:23,709 --> 01:00:24,883
Law of the jungle.

804
01:00:25,503 --> 01:00:28,184
There's a lot of competition, sir.

805
01:00:28,422 --> 01:00:29,633
Here it is.

806
01:00:31,258 --> 01:00:32,469
Thank you.

807
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:34,432
Any news for my godfather?

808
01:00:34,637 --> 01:00:35,729
<i>Gem'.!

809
01:00:35,930 --> 01:00:37,057
Not yet.

810
01:00:39,976 --> 01:00:42,277
- I'm off.
- We'll keep you informed.

811
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:43,777
Goodbye.

812
01:01:07,086 --> 01:01:08,758
Hi, Csilla, what's up?

813
01:01:09,005 --> 01:01:11,425
Car crash. Came in an hour ago,

814
01:01:11,632 --> 01:01:12,676
in a coma.

815
01:01:13,509 --> 01:01:14,980
Mr. Bulai is waiting.

816
01:01:15,177 --> 01:01:16,351
How is he?

817
01:01:16,637 --> 01:01:18,358
Not too spry, you'll see.

818
01:01:18,723 --> 01:01:20,479
Get his colonoscopy.

819
01:01:20,683 --> 01:01:22,355
I have it ready for you.

820
01:01:23,769 --> 01:01:24,813
Thanks.

821
01:01:28,107 --> 01:01:31,950
The liver doesn't worry me so much,
I knew what to expect.

822
01:01:32,153 --> 01:01:34,739
- This, however, does.
- What?

823
01:01:35,114 --> 01:01:36,786
These polyps here.

824
01:01:37,241 --> 01:01:41,501
Possibly the cause of your condition.
We must remove them first.

825
01:01:41,746 --> 01:01:45,008
No, doctor...
This is terrible news!

826
01:01:45,207 --> 01:01:48,007
No need to panic.
Good thing we saw them.

827
01:01:48,210 --> 01:01:51,473
We'll run tests
and solve the problem.

828
01:01:52,798 --> 01:01:54,850
- Thank you so much-
- What's this?

829
01:01:55,051 --> 01:01:57,222
- Please accept it.
- We agreed...

830
01:01:57,428 --> 01:01:59,065
Don't you trust me?

831
01:01:59,263 --> 01:02:03,190
I do. But one can't have
an operation without paying.

832
01:02:03,392 --> 01:02:07,070
- You're embarrassing me-
- Not at all.

833
01:02:07,313 --> 01:02:10,860
Take it as a heartfelt gift.
It's for my peace of mind.

834
01:02:12,985 --> 01:02:15,915
Mr. Bulai,
I need my peace of mind too.

835
01:02:16,113 --> 01:02:18,664
So this stays here.
After the surgery,

836
01:02:18,866 --> 01:02:20,503
we talk and see. Deal?

837
01:02:21,702 --> 01:02:25,333
If only...
If I ever wake up from it!

838
01:02:25,539 --> 01:02:30,890
Mr. Bulai, please, it's essential
that you keep a positive outlook!

839
01:02:31,087 --> 01:02:33,721
My life is in your hands now.

840
01:02:33,923 --> 01:02:36,557
Everything will be fine, don't worry!

841
01:02:36,759 --> 01:02:38,349
I pray to God it will be!

842
01:02:38,678 --> 01:02:40,813
OK, enough of this!

843
01:02:43,349 --> 01:02:46,481
Have things worked out
with your daughter?

844
01:02:47,019 --> 01:02:49,404
I spoke with him, yes.
Thank you.

845
01:02:49,605 --> 01:02:51,326
He's a kind man.

846
01:02:51,524 --> 01:02:54,952
Yes. He understood
it was difficult for me too.

847
01:02:55,152 --> 01:02:58,450
Misfortunes occur. Unpredictably.

848
01:02:58,906 --> 01:03:00,460
It could have been worse.

849
01:03:01,867 --> 01:03:03,160
Still, it's hard.

850
01:03:03,828 --> 01:03:05,915
You don't know what's best.

851
01:03:06,330 --> 01:03:07,837
That's the hard part.

852
01:03:08,290 --> 01:03:12,052
But if you do something earnestly,
with all your heart,

853
01:03:12,295 --> 01:03:13,885
you needn't doubt yourself.

854
01:03:14,130 --> 01:03:15,173
You think so?

855
01:03:15,381 --> 01:03:17,600
I don't think so, I'm sure.

856
01:03:17,967 --> 01:03:19,770
Please, go, go!

857
01:03:20,970 --> 01:03:21,848
Yes.

858
01:03:33,024 --> 01:03:33,902
Hello.

859
01:03:34,692 --> 01:03:35,653
Hello.

860
01:03:35,943 --> 01:03:37,580
I'm Eliza's father.

861
01:03:37,987 --> 01:03:41,119
We met at the motorcycling school.

862
01:03:41,324 --> 01:03:42,332
Oh, right.

863
01:03:42,533 --> 01:03:45,748
Excuse me, I'm...
I didn't sleep last night.

864
01:03:45,995 --> 01:03:47,917
- You were busy.
- Yes.

865
01:03:48,331 --> 01:03:52,127
I d] in a club
for some extra money, so...

866
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:54,050
Everything OK with Eliza?

867
01:03:54,253 --> 01:03:57,101
It's OK.
She can steer one-handed now.

868
01:03:57,673 --> 01:04:00,307
We'll have to cancel the exam, right?

869
01:04:00,509 --> 01:04:01,352
Yes.

870
01:04:01,552 --> 01:04:04,435
- Was it on Thursday?
- It won't be possible.

871
01:04:06,057 --> 01:04:09,520
- Are you waiting for her?
- Yes, I promised I would.

872
01:04:11,395 --> 01:04:13,198
It's taking so long today...

873
01:04:13,564 --> 01:04:16,993
Yes. Finals have got
so complicated lately.

874
01:04:17,276 --> 01:04:19,032
Me, I was out in 1 hour.

875
01:04:19,236 --> 01:04:20,328
<i>'Rwy':
Ah“!

876
01:04:21,030 --> 01:04:23,000
Truth is, we were organized.

877
01:04:23,282 --> 01:04:24,623
What school was it?

878
01:04:25,076 --> 01:04:27,295
The Sports School, if you know it.

879
01:04:27,703 --> 01:04:30,123
- Behind the-
- By the train station.

880
01:04:30,706 --> 01:04:32,877
What do you mean "organized"?

881
01:04:33,376 --> 01:04:35,677
Our specialty was sport,

882
01:04:35,878 --> 01:04:40,635
so the teachers were flexible.
The reputation of the school counts.

883
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:43,434
I see.
So they let you cheat.

884
01:04:43,844 --> 01:04:47,807
We had access to some sources
of inspiration, Romanian's hard...

885
01:04:48,015 --> 01:04:51,728
With so much training,
we had little time to study.

886
01:04:53,396 --> 01:04:55,531
You want a degree in sports?

887
01:04:56,399 --> 01:05:00,456
If Eliza went to Uni in Clui,
I could try something there.

888
01:05:00,611 --> 01:05:04,289
But given the new situation...
we'll see.

889
01:05:04,657 --> 01:05:08,003
She'll go to England.
The scholarship's a big chance.

890
01:05:08,202 --> 01:05:09,673
Of course.

891
01:05:09,912 --> 01:05:12,629
Marius, I wanted to ask you something.

892
01:05:12,832 --> 01:05:13,793
Go ahead.

893
01:05:14,625 --> 01:05:16,547
The day Eliza was attacked,

894
01:05:16,752 --> 01:05:20,513
she said you were going to meet.
Could you tell me

895
01:05:20,715 --> 01:05:22,268
what happened?

896
01:05:24,135 --> 01:05:26,934
I was supposed to be there at 1:50.

897
01:05:27,138 --> 01:05:30,103
But the bus didn't come.
I mean, it was late.

898
01:05:30,391 --> 01:05:31,779
So when I arrived,

899
01:05:31,976 --> 01:05:35,238
Eliza wasn't there,
where we usually meet.

900
01:05:35,438 --> 01:05:38,155
I see. Did you call her?

901
01:05:38,357 --> 01:05:40,991
Of course I did, only it didn't...

902
01:05:41,193 --> 01:05:43,614
she didn't answer.
It wasn't ringing.

903
01:05:44,113 --> 01:05:46,165
- So, she didn't answer.
- No.

904
01:05:46,365 --> 01:05:48,999
Probably...
Or it didn't get through at all?

905
01:05:49,201 --> 01:05:52,914
Yes. You can imagine how I fell
when I found out.

906
01:05:53,122 --> 01:05:57,084
If I'd got there
5 minutes earlier, who knows?

907
01:05:57,501 --> 01:05:59,507
You considered calling the police?

908
01:05:59,795 --> 01:06:02,844
I didn't worry.
I thought she'd gone into school.

909
01:06:03,049 --> 01:06:06,228
- Without waiting for you?
- Well, as I was late...

910
01:06:06,802 --> 01:06:09,596
I ask because somebody
called the police.

911
01:06:09,597 --> 01:06:09,775
I ask because somebody
called the police.

912
01:06:10,348 --> 01:06:13,065
Could be.
Did you get the number?

913
01:06:13,267 --> 01:06:15,272
A prepaid SIM.

914
01:06:15,811 --> 01:06:16,985
I see.

915
01:06:17,563 --> 01:06:19,034
There's Eliza now.

916
01:06:20,691 --> 01:06:22,364
- How did it go?
- Fine.

917
01:06:25,821 --> 01:06:27,624
- Tired?
- A bit.

918
01:06:27,823 --> 01:06:29,081
Shall Hake you home?

919
01:06:29,241 --> 01:06:32,670
I'll hang around a bit in town,
get some air.

920
01:06:33,663 --> 01:06:35,216
Did it go well?

921
01:06:35,998 --> 01:06:37,172
It did.

922
01:06:39,835 --> 01:06:41,638
I'll get back by myself, OK?

923
01:06:42,213 --> 01:06:43,554
Be careful on that...

924
01:06:43,756 --> 01:06:44,634
I will.

925
01:07:43,399 --> 01:07:44,190
Mum, I asked you <i>2</i> things:

926
01:07:44,191 --> 01:07:45,402
Mum, I asked you <i>2</i> things:

927
01:07:45,609 --> 01:07:47,694
to let him buy bread by himself
and not to sleep with him.

928
01:07:47,695 --> 01:07:49,415
To let him buy bread by himself
and not to sleep with him.

929
01:07:50,698 --> 01:07:53,747
Yes, I know it's not easy for him,
I know.

930
01:07:55,119 --> 01:07:57,420
Neither is raising him alone.

931
01:07:59,457 --> 01:08:03,134
No, Mum, you're helping me
if you follow my rules.

932
01:08:03,377 --> 01:08:03,710
It does matter,
I don't want to raise a mummy's boy!

933
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:06,808
It does matter,
I don't want to raise a mummy's boy!

934
01:08:08,799 --> 01:08:10,970
I'll call you later, OK?

935
01:08:11,510 --> 01:08:12,982
Yes, bye.

936
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:16,520
Listen to this.

937
01:08:16,807 --> 01:08:19,026
I went today to Micii Campioni.

938
01:08:19,226 --> 01:08:20,226
<i>“Micii Campioni?

939
01:08:20,227 --> 01:08:20,737
<i>“Micii Campioni?

940
01:08:20,936 --> 01:08:23,405
The English school.
Forgotten already?

941
01:08:23,606 --> 01:08:25,575
You called it "Little Champions".

942
01:08:25,775 --> 01:08:29,239
I say: I'm here to enroll my boy
for this autumn.

943
01:08:29,445 --> 01:08:32,542
We're full up, she says.
I couldn't even finish!

944
01:08:32,907 --> 01:08:35,956
I say: The enrollment period
hasn't even started!

945
01:08:36,243 --> 01:08:36,743
So she tells me about
siblings having priority,

946
01:08:36,744 --> 01:08:39,757
So she tells me about
siblings having priority,

947
01:08:39,955 --> 01:08:42,257
children who live locally
and so on.

948
01:08:42,708 --> 01:08:43,919
It's a private school?

949
01:08:44,126 --> 01:08:46,712
State. But with extra English.

950
01:08:46,921 --> 01:08:49,424
Get him into your school. Simpler.

951
01:08:49,632 --> 01:08:52,759
I want him to start being
more independent.

952
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:53,187
I want him to start being
more independent.

953
01:08:53,552 --> 01:08:56,601
- They knew about his speech problems?
- Yes.

954
01:08:56,806 --> 01:09:00,318
That's it. Or maybe they wanted
a little pay-off?

955
01:09:00,559 --> 01:09:02,399
Why? It's a public school!

956
01:09:02,687 --> 01:09:06,033
I spoke with the headmistress,
he'll take a test.

957
01:09:06,774 --> 01:09:09,275
But his speech problems
must be treated.

958
01:09:09,276 --> 01:09:10,320
But his speech problems
must be treated.

959
01:09:10,528 --> 01:09:11,453
Yes.

960
01:09:12,196 --> 01:09:13,833
So could you help me?

961
01:09:13,990 --> 01:09:17,584
Yes, as soon as l finish
with Eliza's exams.

962
01:09:17,827 --> 01:09:20,792
It'll be too late.
The school will be full.

963
01:09:20,997 --> 01:09:24,544
He needs a speech therapist,
it's not that easy.

964
01:09:24,750 --> 01:09:25,792
I know.
That's why I asked you.

965
01:09:25,793 --> 01:09:26,967
I know.
That's why I asked you.

966
01:09:28,004 --> 01:09:31,800
Sorry, but I can't really focus
on anything else.

967
01:09:32,383 --> 01:09:34,554
If Eliza fails to leave now...

968
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:35,971
You can imagine...

969
01:09:40,891 --> 01:09:42,308
I know Eliza's always
your top priority.

970
01:09:42,310 --> 01:09:43,437
I know Eliza's always
your top priority.

971
01:09:43,644 --> 01:09:46,278
But it's never the right time
for me.

972
01:09:46,605 --> 01:09:48,492
Something always comes up.

973
01:09:48,691 --> 01:09:51,076
I can't go on like this, Romeo.

974
01:09:51,610 --> 01:09:54,873
I need to take some decisions
about my life.

975
01:09:55,072 --> 01:09:58,324
I'm 35, I can't hang around
waiting for... what?

976
01:09:58,326 --> 01:09:58,420
I'm 35, I can't hang around
waiting for... what?

977
01:09:58,784 --> 01:10:01,003
I need to be sure
of some things.

978
01:10:01,203 --> 01:10:04,501
You always avoid
making plans or clear decisions.

979
01:10:04,957 --> 01:10:07,377
What clear decisions have I avoided?

980
01:10:08,544 --> 01:10:11,427
What decisions, Romeo?
Don't you know?

981
01:10:11,714 --> 01:10:14,841
Meeting in secret for over a year
suits you?

982
01:10:14,842 --> 01:10:15,186
Meeting in secret for over a year
suits you?

983
01:10:15,384 --> 01:10:17,555
Or that I sleep alone here?

984
01:10:17,762 --> 01:10:19,518
While you sleep at home?

985
01:10:19,889 --> 01:10:21,858
I sleep in the living room!

986
01:10:22,433 --> 01:10:25,482
And I've never hidden
my situation from you.

987
01:10:26,062 --> 01:10:30,818
Yes, but we can't keep up
this uncertainty, this lie.

988
01:10:31,108 --> 01:10:31,358
I don't want to lie to my child.

989
01:10:31,359 --> 01:10:33,328
I don't want to lie to my child.

990
01:10:33,527 --> 01:10:36,576
Who asked you to lie to him, Sandra?

991
01:10:37,281 --> 01:10:40,496
Matei and I didn't meet
until you wanted us to,

992
01:10:40,701 --> 01:10:43,086
and when you wanted us to, we did.

993
01:10:43,454 --> 01:10:45,091
I don't see why,

994
01:10:45,289 --> 01:10:47,374
given what happened to us,
you come up with all this.

995
01:10:47,375 --> 01:10:49,047
Given what happened to us,
you come up with all this.

996
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:51,132
Given what happened to whom?

997
01:10:51,504 --> 01:10:54,469
To you and your family?

998
01:10:55,299 --> 01:10:57,518
Does what happens to me matter?

999
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:00,560
Or does it matter less, or later?

1000
01:11:00,888 --> 01:11:03,189
If you have time,
or when you feel like it?

1001
01:11:14,402 --> 01:11:15,493
Is he here?

1002
01:11:16,779 --> 01:11:17,823
He is.

1003
01:11:18,030 --> 01:11:19,833
Romeo, it's for you.

1004
01:11:25,663 --> 01:11:27,549
Grandma collapsed.

1005
01:11:28,582 --> 01:11:29,544
Eliza!

1006
01:11:30,126 --> 01:11:31,716
Eliza, wait!

1007
01:11:51,188 --> 01:11:52,695
Park Street 62, yes.

1008
01:11:52,898 --> 01:11:52,939
Why is she there?

1009
01:11:52,940 --> 01:11:54,151
Why is she there?

1010
01:11:54,358 --> 01:11:56,577
She fell going to the bathroom.

1011
01:11:56,819 --> 01:11:58,373
Why isn't she in bed?

1012
01:11:58,654 --> 01:12:00,410
We were afraid to move her.

1013
01:12:00,614 --> 01:12:02,287
Help me get her into bed.

1014
01:12:02,533 --> 01:12:04,372
The stethoscope!
In the closet!

1015
01:12:04,618 --> 01:12:06,339
Got her? Up!

1016
01:12:08,247 --> 01:12:09,456
Take that jar away, please.

1017
01:12:09,457 --> 01:12:10,750
Take that jar away, please.

1018
01:12:12,835 --> 01:12:15,421
- You called the ambulance?
- No.

1019
01:12:15,629 --> 01:12:17,101
I did, just now.

1020
01:12:17,298 --> 01:12:18,805
Open that window!

1021
01:12:19,008 --> 01:12:21,511
- The bathroom window's open.
- It's OK.

1022
01:12:22,219 --> 01:12:25,399
Good Lord!
She was fine at noon and...

1023
01:12:25,598 --> 01:12:25,972
Quiet!

1024
01:12:25,973 --> 01:12:27,017
Quiet!

1025
01:12:29,518 --> 01:12:30,811
Pass me her medicine,

1026
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:33,191
the Cavinton. It's over there.

1027
01:12:33,481 --> 01:12:34,442
Hurry "P!

1028
01:12:40,154 --> 01:12:41,988
Good. Keep her head tilted.

1029
01:12:41,989 --> 01:12:42,369
Good. Keep her head tilted.

1030
01:12:42,865 --> 01:12:44,502
Turn on the light.

1031
01:12:47,495 --> 01:12:49,251
Do you know what she ate?

1032
01:12:49,455 --> 01:12:52,836
I brought some beans.
And a pickled cucumber.

1033
01:12:53,042 --> 01:12:55,545
But she didn't even touch the cucumber.

1034
01:12:56,087 --> 01:12:58,505
I told you:
no more salty, bloating food.

1035
01:12:58,506 --> 01:12:59,182
I told you:
no more salty, bloating food.

1036
01:12:59,423 --> 01:13:02,057
There were hardly 3 spoonfuls there.

1037
01:13:02,885 --> 01:13:04,558
Put her feet up a bit.

1038
01:13:10,142 --> 01:13:11,316
What's wrong?

1039
01:13:11,519 --> 01:13:13,855
- The rubbing alcohol.
- It's there.

1040
01:13:14,313 --> 01:13:15,021
The bottom one!

1041
01:13:15,022 --> 01:13:15,450
The bottom one!

1042
01:13:16,607 --> 01:13:17,995
Come on, Mum!

1043
01:13:20,152 --> 01:13:21,326
Is it serious?

1044
01:13:22,029 --> 01:13:24,414
Don't worry, she'll be fine.

1045
01:13:24,615 --> 01:13:25,873
It's not that bad.

1046
01:13:28,119 --> 01:13:29,293
Keep pressing.

1047
01:13:29,537 --> 01:13:31,037
It's the ambulance crew, sir.

1048
01:13:31,038 --> 01:13:31,418
It's the ambulance crew, sir.

1049
01:13:32,915 --> 01:13:34,042
Good evening.

1050
01:13:35,292 --> 01:13:36,503
I'm her son.

1051
01:13:36,877 --> 01:13:37,969
Aldea.

1052
01:13:38,421 --> 01:13:39,548
I'm a doctor.

1053
01:13:40,881 --> 01:13:43,930
She has a heart condition
and fainting spells.

1054
01:13:44,468 --> 01:13:47,054
Her heart.
And intracranial hypertension.

1055
01:13:48,097 --> 01:13:49,485
In her head, yes.

1056
01:13:50,516 --> 01:13:53,197
No, it's in a more difficult area.

1057
01:13:53,894 --> 01:13:55,187
We don't know yet.

1058
01:13:55,396 --> 01:13:56,238
Dad!

1059
01:13:56,647 --> 01:13:59,032
I'll call from my phone in a moment.

1060
01:13:59,483 --> 01:14:01,156
No, she'll wake up.

1061
01:14:01,527 --> 01:14:03,200
I gave her a shot.

1062
01:14:04,613 --> 01:14:06,832
As you wish. Yes.

1063
01:14:07,325 --> 01:14:08,748
What's this, Mum?

1064
01:14:09,285 --> 01:14:10,708
Do you want to scare us?

1065
01:14:20,796 --> 01:14:22,386
Let's go, it's late.

1066
01:14:22,965 --> 01:14:24,057
I'm staying.

1067
01:14:24,967 --> 01:14:26,937
Eliza, Grandma's OK now.

1068
01:14:27,428 --> 01:14:29,765
What's intracranial hypertension?

1069
01:14:33,434 --> 01:14:35,771
It's a sort of pressure on the brain.

1070
01:14:35,978 --> 01:14:36,603
Depending on the area,
it can cause these episodes.

1071
01:14:36,604 --> 01:14:39,154
Depending on the area,
it can cause these episodes.

1072
01:14:40,107 --> 01:14:41,994
- Is it serious?
- Serious...

1073
01:14:42,610 --> 01:14:44,117
We'll see how it develops.

1074
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:45,873
Why didn't you tell us?

1075
01:14:46,072 --> 01:14:47,365
Tell you what?

1076
01:14:47,573 --> 01:14:49,376
For now, she's fine.

1077
01:14:49,617 --> 01:14:51,373
And I'll take care of it.

1078
01:14:53,454 --> 01:14:55,091
How was the exam, today?

1079
01:14:55,331 --> 01:14:57,466
Good. The questions were easy.

1080
01:14:59,418 --> 01:15:00,462
Good.

1081
01:15:01,295 --> 01:15:03,466
Let's go, you'll be tired tomorrow.

1082
01:15:07,468 --> 01:15:08,809
Why don't you answer?

1083
01:15:09,011 --> 01:15:09,636
I'll call back later.

1084
01:15:09,637 --> 01:15:10,515
I'll call back later.

1085
01:15:11,305 --> 01:15:14,022
Your phone was on silent
when I called.

1086
01:15:14,308 --> 01:15:15,862
I was in surgery.

1087
01:15:16,060 --> 01:15:17,068
Dad...

1088
01:15:18,562 --> 01:15:20,650
I want you to talk to Mum.

1089
01:15:20,982 --> 01:15:22,025
Eliza,

1090
01:15:22,566 --> 01:15:25,652
what Mum and I
have to discuss is our business.

1091
01:15:25,653 --> 01:15:26,080
What Mum and I
have to discuss is our business.

1092
01:15:26,278 --> 01:15:27,322
No, Dad.

1093
01:15:27,530 --> 01:15:31,291
Don't think I can go home
like nothing happened.

1094
01:15:31,951 --> 01:15:33,790
Please go and talk to her.

1095
01:15:33,995 --> 01:15:36,130
Please, get your things.

1096
01:15:36,330 --> 01:15:37,292
- No, Dad.
- Eliza!

1097
01:15:37,498 --> 01:15:38,210
No!

1098
01:15:38,624 --> 01:15:41,721
Talk to her
or I won't sit the exam tomorrow.

1099
01:15:42,086 --> 01:15:42,168
Excuse me?

1100
01:15:42,169 --> 01:15:43,297
Excuse me?

1101
01:15:45,047 --> 01:15:46,340
I'm sorry.

1102
01:15:46,882 --> 01:15:48,436
I didn't mean it.

1103
01:15:49,176 --> 01:15:50,054
But...

1104
01:15:50,761 --> 01:15:54,605
please do it.
Go and talk to her tonight.

1105
01:15:55,474 --> 01:15:57,859
You think you can blackmail me?

1106
01:15:59,478 --> 01:16:03,489
Eliza! You think you're doing
this exam for me?

1107
01:16:03,691 --> 01:16:05,198
Or for your mother?

1108
01:16:05,776 --> 01:16:08,196
You think you're doing us a favour?

1109
01:16:09,071 --> 01:16:11,835
I jump through hoops for you
and you do this?

1110
01:16:12,033 --> 01:16:14,251
I never asked you to jump through-

1111
01:16:14,452 --> 01:16:14,701
No, you didn't.

1112
01:16:14,702 --> 01:16:15,876
No, you didn't.

1113
01:16:16,245 --> 01:16:20,302
But did you ask for any of the things
I always did for you?

1114
01:16:20,499 --> 01:16:23,180
Or did I just do them?

1115
01:16:24,503 --> 01:16:25,761
Can you even imagine

1116
01:16:25,963 --> 01:16:29,226
what we had to do
so you can live like this?

1117
01:16:31,552 --> 01:16:35,064
You shouldn't have done it
if it wasn't right.

1118
01:16:36,015 --> 01:16:39,479
It's so easy to say
"you shouldn't have done it".

1119
01:16:40,227 --> 01:16:42,778
Would you be going to study in the UK

1120
01:16:42,980 --> 01:16:45,365
without all the private lessons

1121
01:16:45,816 --> 01:16:47,734
or the competitions you were in?

1122
01:16:47,735 --> 01:16:47,949
Or the competitions you were in?

1123
01:16:48,152 --> 01:16:50,453
I hope you didn't rig those, too.

1124
01:16:50,655 --> 01:16:53,668
What? How can you say that?

1125
01:16:56,952 --> 01:16:59,254
How could you do this to Mum?

1126
01:17:00,748 --> 01:17:02,800
That's really not your business.

1127
01:17:04,126 --> 01:17:08,267
You know,
we made this effort for you.

1128
01:17:08,464 --> 01:17:10,136
So you wouldn't suffer.

1129
01:17:13,427 --> 01:17:15,978
I don't want to go to the UK anymore.

1130
01:17:16,180 --> 01:17:18,185
I want to stay here with Marius.

1131
01:17:18,599 --> 01:17:19,726
Really?

1132
01:17:20,184 --> 01:17:20,266
Very well then.

1133
01:17:20,267 --> 01:17:21,276
Very well then.

1134
01:17:22,395 --> 01:17:25,657
Go get a job,
see how the real world is.

1135
01:17:26,190 --> 01:17:29,405
But in 10 years
you might regret it.

1136
01:17:29,610 --> 01:17:31,331
It'll be too late.

1137
01:17:32,488 --> 01:17:34,873
- The lady needs the bathroom.
- OK.

1138
01:17:37,368 --> 01:17:39,207
Sleep here if you want.

1139
01:17:39,620 --> 01:17:41,423
I'll pick you up at 7.

1140
01:17:41,664 --> 01:17:43,171
Marius will take me.

1141
01:17:46,544 --> 01:17:47,635
Easy, Mum.

1142
01:17:48,754 --> 01:17:52,765
There now, dear.
I'm not dead yet.

1143
01:17:57,638 --> 01:17:58,765
Can you manage?

1144
01:17:59,056 --> 01:18:00,314
<i>Yes, dear.

1145
01:19:23,891 --> 01:19:24,983
Hi, Magda.

1146
01:19:25,184 --> 01:19:26,145
Hello.

1147
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:43,681
Come in.

1148
01:20:48,059 --> 01:20:48,983
What's wrong?

1149
01:20:49,727 --> 01:20:53,239
Grandma collapsed
and Eliza got scared.

1150
01:20:53,522 --> 01:20:55,243
She's staying over.

1151
01:20:55,441 --> 01:20:57,909
- Is she OK now?
- She's better, yes.

1152
01:20:59,904 --> 01:21:01,576
How did she do in the exam?

1153
01:21:02,573 --> 01:21:04,625
I don't know, she didn't say.

1154
01:21:10,998 --> 01:21:13,134
She came to find me at Sandra's.

1155
01:21:16,128 --> 01:21:19,058
She was afraid Grandma would die
so she came.

1156
01:21:22,051 --> 01:21:23,522
You were at Sandra's?

1157
01:21:23,761 --> 01:21:24,686
Yes.

1158
01:21:27,348 --> 01:21:29,483
How did she know you were there?

1159
01:21:30,351 --> 01:21:31,608
I don't know.

1160
01:21:33,479 --> 01:21:35,199
And what did you tell her?

1161
01:21:35,940 --> 01:21:37,363
Nothing.

1162
01:21:38,943 --> 01:21:41,446
I promised her I'd talk to you.

1163
01:21:46,826 --> 01:21:49,506
You shouldn't have influenced her grade.

1164
01:21:50,871 --> 01:21:52,045
After that,

1165
01:21:52,957 --> 01:21:55,840
what does all we've taught her
count for?

1166
01:21:56,127 --> 01:21:57,799
The same as before.

1167
01:21:58,838 --> 01:22:00,594
But not here.

1168
01:22:06,846 --> 01:22:08,851
I'll follow her.

1169
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:10,648
Where?

1170
01:22:11,308 --> 01:22:12,566
Anywhere.

1171
01:22:14,186 --> 01:22:15,989
Wherever she goes,

1172
01:22:16,689 --> 01:22:18,077
I'll go too.

1173
01:22:19,942 --> 01:22:21,994
Have you asked what she thinks?

1174
01:22:23,070 --> 01:22:24,363
I won't be in her way.

1175
01:22:25,364 --> 01:22:27,535
I'll cook for her...

1176
01:22:27,992 --> 01:22:29,712
I'll wait for her at home...

1177
01:22:30,036 --> 01:22:31,210
In the student dorm?

1178
01:22:31,746 --> 01:22:33,383
We'll rent somewhere.

1179
01:22:35,916 --> 01:22:37,304
With what?

1180
01:22:39,003 --> 01:22:41,589
We'll rent out this place,

1181
01:22:42,340 --> 01:22:43,893
or sell it.

1182
01:22:50,473 --> 01:22:52,893
Even if Eliza hadn't found out,

1183
01:22:53,100 --> 01:22:55,818
it was time for you to move.

1184
01:22:57,938 --> 01:22:59,944
Isn't this my home too?

1185
01:23:01,484 --> 01:23:03,156
Not for a long time.

1186
01:23:05,613 --> 01:23:09,125
Once Eliza leaves, you're free

1187
01:23:09,450 --> 01:23:11,918
to rebuild your life
with anyone you wish.

1188
01:23:12,495 --> 01:23:14,416
Rebuild what?

1189
01:23:15,414 --> 01:23:17,254
That no longer concerns me.

1190
01:23:18,709 --> 01:23:23,715
Just know that, whether Eliza
goes to the UK or to Cluj,

1191
01:23:24,548 --> 01:23:26,684
you can't stay here anymore.

1192
01:23:30,971 --> 01:23:32,858
May I ask you something?

1193
01:23:33,849 --> 01:23:37,397
Talk to Eliza,
get her to do the exam tomorrow.

1194
01:23:38,354 --> 01:23:39,611
Won't you drive her?

1195
01:23:40,356 --> 01:23:42,112
She said Marius would.

1196
01:23:45,236 --> 01:23:46,327
Fine.

1197
01:23:50,157 --> 01:23:52,957
But you stop sleeping here
from tonight.

1198
01:23:54,537 --> 01:23:56,756
I need to tell Eliza something.

1199
01:24:02,253 --> 01:24:03,261
OK.

1200
01:24:53,679 --> 01:24:56,230
They're doing the grille
tomorrow.

1201
01:24:57,224 --> 01:24:58,565
I'll deal with it.

1202
01:25:01,687 --> 01:25:03,075
Goodnight.

1203
01:25:04,231 --> 01:25:05,572
Goodnight.

1204
01:25:50,903 --> 01:25:52,624
- Morning.
- Hello, Elena.

1205
01:25:52,822 --> 01:25:55,242
Csilla wants
to see you urgently.

1206
01:25:55,449 --> 01:25:57,668
- She's here?
- She was called in.

1207
01:25:57,868 --> 01:25:58,996
Why?

1208
01:25:59,161 --> 01:26:01,249
She'll explain.
Coffee's ready.

1209
01:26:01,455 --> 01:26:02,713
Thank you.

1210
01:26:03,624 --> 01:26:06,839
- Is today the last exam?
- Yes, the last one.

1211
01:26:07,044 --> 01:26:09,014
- How's Eliza?
- Better.

1212
01:26:09,213 --> 01:26:10,934
God bless her.

1213
01:26:11,132 --> 01:26:12,223
Thank you.

1214
01:26:15,177 --> 01:26:16,388
What's going on?

1215
01:26:16,595 --> 01:26:18,019
Some prosecutors are here.

1216
01:26:18,222 --> 01:26:19,100
Why?

1217
01:26:19,306 --> 01:26:21,276
There's a warrant for Mr. Bulai.

1218
01:26:21,475 --> 01:26:25,070
The intern forbade them to see him
before you came.

1219
01:26:25,229 --> 01:26:28,492
- Why didn't you call me?
- Do you ever answer?

1220
01:26:29,942 --> 01:26:31,698
How is Bulai feeling?

1221
01:26:32,153 --> 01:26:33,873
Not so good, doctor.

1222
01:26:34,655 --> 01:26:36,707
- You offered them coffee?
- Yes.

1223
01:26:37,908 --> 01:26:40,079
Check if Eliza got to the exam.

1224
01:26:40,286 --> 01:26:41,923
- OK.
- Thank you.

1225
01:26:42,163 --> 01:26:44,666
Your car keys.
I'm taking it to be fixed.

1226
01:26:46,083 --> 01:26:47,886
Best of luck, doctor.

1227
01:26:48,169 --> 01:26:49,462
Thank you, Csilla.

1228
01:26:58,804 --> 01:27:00,145
Good morning.

1229
01:27:00,389 --> 01:27:01,481
Good morning.

1230
01:27:02,558 --> 01:27:05,144
Ivascu, Public Prosecutor's office.

1231
01:27:05,353 --> 01:27:07,025
My colleague, Mr. Albu.

1232
01:27:07,229 --> 01:27:09,815
- How may I help?
- Do you have a minute?

1233
01:27:10,024 --> 01:27:11,531
I have my rounds.

1234
01:27:11,734 --> 01:27:13,988
Still, sit.
We need to clarify a few things.

1235
01:27:14,195 --> 01:27:15,286
It won't take long.

1236
01:27:22,036 --> 01:27:23,210
I'm listening.

1237
01:27:23,537 --> 01:27:25,673
You know Mr. Alexandru Bulai?

1238
01:27:25,873 --> 01:27:27,380
He was admitted here.

1239
01:27:27,583 --> 01:27:28,508
Of course I do.

1240
01:27:28,709 --> 01:27:31,213
- How well?
- Not that well.

1241
01:27:31,420 --> 01:27:35,762
I don't mean you're friends
but you've met him before?

1242
01:27:36,008 --> 01:27:39,852
Sorry, but could you tell me
what this is about?

1243
01:27:41,389 --> 01:27:44,153
Mr. Bulai is facing criminal charges

1244
01:27:44,392 --> 01:27:47,239
regarding his function
<i>as</i> customs chief,

1245
01:27:47,478 --> 01:27:50,326
as well as other aspects
of his work.

1246
01:27:50,523 --> 01:27:51,816
I see.

1247
01:27:52,024 --> 01:27:53,032
And?

1248
01:27:53,234 --> 01:27:55,951
We'd like to discuss
some issues with him,

1249
01:27:56,153 --> 01:27:59,416
but his lawyer claims he's unfit.

1250
01:27:59,615 --> 01:28:00,826
Medically unfit.

1251
01:28:01,033 --> 01:28:02,504
He is very ill.

1252
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:06,375
He'll die if he doesn't get
a liver very quickly.

1253
01:28:06,872 --> 01:28:09,257
And even then, his situation is...

1254
01:28:10,292 --> 01:28:13,341
I see.
So what do you recommend?

1255
01:28:13,754 --> 01:28:16,305
Do you think
he could stand detention?

1256
01:28:16,507 --> 01:28:19,141
Right now, it's out of the question.

1257
01:28:20,302 --> 01:28:21,595
But a talk?

1258
01:28:21,804 --> 01:28:23,358
Is that also too much?

1259
01:28:23,973 --> 01:28:25,693
Depends on how long it is.

1260
01:28:27,977 --> 01:28:29,400
Tell me,

1261
01:28:29,895 --> 01:28:32,066
would a medical commission

1262
01:28:32,314 --> 01:28:34,616
reach the same conclusion?

1263
01:28:34,859 --> 01:28:38,951
I presume so,
but since we live in Romania...

1264
01:28:39,155 --> 01:28:43,580
Doctors sometimes protect patients
for bad reasons...

1265
01:28:43,826 --> 01:28:45,748
Listen...

1266
01:28:46,287 --> 01:28:50,214
You see a mote in your brother's eye
but not the beam in your own.

1267
01:28:50,416 --> 01:28:52,753
Could you be more specific?

1268
01:28:53,085 --> 01:28:56,348
You have the reputation

1269
01:28:56,672 --> 01:28:58,594
of being an honest doctor.

1270
01:28:58,799 --> 01:29:02,430
You don't ask patients for incentives,
as some others do.

1271
01:29:02,636 --> 01:29:04,891
You're free to search my office-

1272
01:29:05,097 --> 01:29:07,352
There's no need for that,

1273
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:10,613
and anyway, we'd need a warrant.

1274
01:29:11,479 --> 01:29:12,820
But you know...

1275
01:29:13,856 --> 01:29:15,742
Everyone has his weak spot.

1276
01:29:16,233 --> 01:29:17,954
I'm not sure I follow.

1277
01:29:19,236 --> 01:29:21,704
In very complex investigations,

1278
01:29:22,031 --> 01:29:25,329
certain procedures are followed,
do you understand?

1279
01:29:25,618 --> 01:29:30,541
Depending on the findings,
the charges can be extended.

1280
01:29:31,624 --> 01:29:34,838
Influence peddling,
incitement and so on.

1281
01:29:35,044 --> 01:29:37,844
So the suspect's calls
are intercepted.

1282
01:29:38,047 --> 01:29:39,257
Do you understand?

1283
01:29:39,715 --> 01:29:44,224
If any kind of fraud is suspected,
further investigations follow.

1284
01:29:44,387 --> 01:29:47,733
We know you had some conversations
with Mr. Bulai.

1285
01:29:49,517 --> 01:29:52,649
I greatly admire you, professionally.

1286
01:29:53,646 --> 01:29:56,778
And, though I may be
out of line here,

1287
01:29:56,982 --> 01:30:00,364
I'm sure my colleague here
and you above all

1288
01:30:00,569 --> 01:30:03,369
will keep this conversation confidential.

1289
01:30:04,615 --> 01:30:05,789
In brief,

1290
01:30:06,325 --> 01:30:09,422
everything you discussed
with Mr. Bulai

1291
01:30:09,620 --> 01:30:11,957
has been recorded and filed.

1292
01:30:15,376 --> 01:30:16,468
I see.

1293
01:30:18,212 --> 01:30:21,558
Excuse me if I'm being too blunt,

1294
01:30:22,091 --> 01:30:25,769
we're giving you the chance
to correct your mistakes.

1295
01:30:26,137 --> 01:30:29,102
"Errare humanum est",
as the Romans used to say.

1296
01:30:29,306 --> 01:30:32,854
You have mitigating circumstances.
We have children too.

1297
01:30:33,060 --> 01:30:36,275
We don't know
what we'd have done in your place.

1298
01:30:36,647 --> 01:30:38,154
But the law's the law.

1299
01:30:38,357 --> 01:30:40,327
He who persists in illegality

1300
01:30:40,568 --> 01:30:43,332
will probably have to pay for it.

1301
01:30:43,821 --> 01:30:46,834
As for Mr. Bulai,
with your permission,

1302
01:30:47,033 --> 01:30:49,666
we'd still like to talk to him today,

1303
01:30:49,869 --> 01:30:51,672
ask him a few questions.

1304
01:30:56,584 --> 01:30:58,256
That won't be possible.

1305
01:30:58,502 --> 01:30:59,427
Why?

1306
01:31:02,006 --> 01:31:05,683
Because I can't do that.
I hope you understand.

1307
01:31:09,055 --> 01:31:11,391
I'm very sorry to hear that, doctor.

1308
01:31:12,266 --> 01:31:13,773
I do understand.

1309
01:31:15,394 --> 01:31:17,530
And I respect your decision.

1310
01:31:18,814 --> 01:31:21,116
But I think you should reconsider.

1311
01:31:22,109 --> 01:31:24,909
These investigations
can be very unpleasant.

1312
01:31:25,154 --> 01:31:28,084
For your daughter too,
even if it's not her fault.

1313
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:30,956
You're here at 10 tomorrow?

1314
01:31:31,285 --> 01:31:33,456
Tomorrow and any other day.

1315
01:31:34,205 --> 01:31:36,044
Then we'll see you tomorrow.

1316
01:31:37,833 --> 01:31:38,925
Goodbye.

1317
01:31:40,252 --> 01:31:42,055
Think about it.

1318
01:31:42,213 --> 01:31:44,633
Sometimes it helps to sleep on it.

1319
01:31:46,258 --> 01:31:47,433
If I may ask,

1320
01:31:47,718 --> 01:31:49,355
just out of curiosity...

1321
01:31:50,012 --> 01:31:51,649
Are these real?

1322
01:31:52,390 --> 01:31:53,433
Yes.

1323
01:31:53,641 --> 01:31:55,361
Then my colleague was wrong.

1324
01:31:56,519 --> 01:31:57,860
Have a nice day.

1325
01:32:53,200 --> 01:32:55,087
What did the morticians want?

1326
01:32:55,494 --> 01:32:57,167
Don't worry, it's OK.

1327
01:32:57,413 --> 01:32:58,967
Were they prosecutors?

1328
01:32:59,331 --> 01:33:01,218
Yes, but they're not after us.

1329
01:33:01,917 --> 01:33:04,598
They're after
this patient of mine, Bulai.

1330
01:33:05,296 --> 01:33:07,550
They'll see, when they end up here.

1331
01:33:08,090 --> 01:33:09,514
They're doing their job.

1332
01:33:09,717 --> 01:33:13,098
If they'd done it on time,
we wouldn't be here.

1333
01:33:13,929 --> 01:33:17,275
They're young.
Maybe they'll make things better.

1334
01:33:17,475 --> 01:33:18,685
How?

1335
01:33:19,060 --> 01:33:21,147
Besides, it's too late for us.

1336
01:33:21,979 --> 01:33:24,115
It is, but what can we do?

1337
01:33:25,816 --> 01:33:27,656
Let me know if I can help.

1338
01:33:30,654 --> 01:33:34,083
Can you handle things here?
I have something to do.

1339
01:33:34,825 --> 01:33:36,415
Sure, doctor, go.

1340
01:33:36,619 --> 01:33:37,793
And be careful.

1341
01:33:37,953 --> 01:33:39,211
I will.

1342
01:33:40,039 --> 01:33:41,131
Thanks.

1343
01:33:48,255 --> 01:33:49,347
Inspector!

1344
01:33:51,217 --> 01:33:53,471
There's someone here to see you.

1345
01:34:09,151 --> 01:34:10,539
Hey. How are you?

1346
01:34:11,570 --> 01:34:12,828
How do you think?

1347
01:34:14,448 --> 01:34:17,034
I'm sorry. I had no idea.

1348
01:34:17,493 --> 01:34:18,537
I know you didn't.

1349
01:34:20,121 --> 01:34:22,707
The thing is, my child is involved.

1350
01:34:25,501 --> 01:34:27,636
You really need to talk to her.

1351
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:29,510
Talk about what?

1352
01:34:31,090 --> 01:34:33,060
You need your stories to match.

1353
01:34:33,259 --> 01:34:35,228
How could I do such a thing?

1354
01:34:38,681 --> 01:34:41,184
- Want me to talk to her?
- No.

1355
01:34:42,351 --> 01:34:44,570
I won't involve Eliza anymore.

1356
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:50,536
I'll try to find out
something about these guys.

1357
01:34:50,901 --> 01:34:52,538
Find out what?

1358
01:34:53,779 --> 01:34:56,709
We need to know how to handle them.

1359
01:34:57,408 --> 01:34:59,709
Let's not complicate things further.

1360
01:35:00,953 --> 01:35:03,539
I'll speak to them,
figure something out.

1361
01:35:04,540 --> 01:35:05,667
As you wish.

1362
01:35:08,335 --> 01:35:11,515
Come to the police station
at <i>9</i> for the line-up.

1363
01:35:12,298 --> 01:35:14,054
You think you'll catch him?

1364
01:35:14,592 --> 01:35:17,226
We'll catch that dirty motherfucker.

1365
01:35:31,984 --> 01:35:32,992
Listen...

1366
01:35:33,361 --> 01:35:34,155
Yes?

1367
01:35:34,653 --> 01:35:38,000
I have this feeling
someone's following me.

1368
01:35:38,366 --> 01:35:39,374
How so?

1369
01:35:40,326 --> 01:35:42,497
Someone broke my windscreen.

1370
01:35:43,162 --> 01:35:44,918
You parked in someone's spot.

1371
01:35:45,873 --> 01:35:48,637
Someone broke my living room window too.

1372
01:35:49,210 --> 01:35:51,262
Install a surveillance camera.

1373
01:35:51,462 --> 01:35:52,470
I did.

1374
01:35:55,591 --> 01:35:57,513
Then confess to a priest.

1375
01:35:58,135 --> 01:35:59,309
Thanks.

1376
01:36:02,556 --> 01:36:03,767
I'll be on my way.

1377
01:36:04,767 --> 01:36:06,902
Isn't this a great view?

1378
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:08,398
Yes.

1379
01:36:11,357 --> 01:36:14,821
When we were in school,
the other side looked better.

1380
01:36:17,613 --> 01:36:20,745
The trees have grown,
you can't see much.

1381
01:36:21,659 --> 01:36:22,620
True.

1382
01:36:24,370 --> 01:36:25,877
Well then, I'm off.

1383
01:36:27,373 --> 01:36:28,381
Bye.

1384
01:36:47,351 --> 01:36:48,194
Hello.

1385
01:36:48,394 --> 01:36:50,695
- Thanks for coming.
- It's fine.

1386
01:36:50,896 --> 01:36:52,652
How did it go this morning?

1387
01:36:52,857 --> 01:36:54,363
I didn't take her.

1388
01:36:54,567 --> 01:36:55,908
Wasn't that the plan?

1389
01:36:56,402 --> 01:36:59,783
We argued last night
and she said she'd take a cab.

1390
01:36:59,989 --> 01:37:01,377
Did she sit the exam?

1391
01:37:02,033 --> 01:37:03,373
No idea.

1392
01:37:04,118 --> 01:37:05,292
I see.

1393
01:37:05,786 --> 01:37:08,206
Marius, this is why I called you out.

1394
01:37:08,497 --> 01:37:11,760
They found a suspect in Eliza's case.

1395
01:37:11,959 --> 01:37:15,174
Could you come and see the line-up
this evening?

1396
01:37:15,421 --> 01:37:17,224
Why would I do that?

1397
01:37:17,757 --> 01:37:20,604
She can't remember his face well.

1398
01:37:20,801 --> 01:37:23,020
She needs help or he'll go free.

1399
01:37:23,220 --> 01:37:24,692
But I didn't see him.

1400
01:37:24,889 --> 01:37:27,475
Maybe you glimpsed him from behind

1401
01:37:27,683 --> 01:37:29,984
and you could recognize him.

1402
01:37:30,186 --> 01:37:31,776
How, if I never saw him?

1403
01:37:32,271 --> 01:37:35,653
Marius,
do you agree he should pay?

1404
01:37:35,900 --> 01:37:38,699
- Of course, but-
- Let me explain.

1405
01:37:39,820 --> 01:37:41,790
Can you go there, by the gate?

1406
01:37:45,618 --> 01:37:47,006
A bit further.

1407
01:37:49,121 --> 01:37:51,340
- Can you see me?
- Yes.

1408
01:37:53,501 --> 01:37:55,340
- How about now?
- Yes.

1409
01:37:55,628 --> 01:37:57,099
Good. Come back here.

1410
01:38:02,093 --> 01:38:04,726
Marius, isn't this you?

1411
01:38:06,097 --> 01:38:08,600
- I don't think so.
- Look closer.

1412
01:38:11,102 --> 01:38:12,276
No, it's not me.

1413
01:38:12,478 --> 01:38:15,906
Don't you have trousers
and a sweater like that?

1414
01:38:16,857 --> 01:38:20,239
Jeans.
Everyone looks the same in jeans!

1415
01:38:20,486 --> 01:38:23,867
Why did you tell me
you didn't call the police?

1416
01:38:24,073 --> 01:38:25,745
- I didn't.
- You're lying.

1417
01:38:25,950 --> 01:38:27,955
There's a call from your number.

1418
01:38:28,160 --> 01:38:29,963
I called them, but not then.

1419
01:38:30,162 --> 01:38:32,002
- When then?
- When l found her.

1420
01:38:32,206 --> 01:38:34,507
- At 8:03!
- I don't know precisely-

1421
01:38:34,709 --> 01:38:38,849
You saw the attack and called,
you got scared and hung up!

1422
01:38:39,046 --> 01:38:41,431
- It's not true!
- Look at this photo!

1423
01:38:42,425 --> 01:38:45,390
- You watched and did nothing!
- It's not me!

1424
01:38:45,594 --> 01:38:49,142
Why didn't you call for help?
How could you pass by?

1425
01:38:49,348 --> 01:38:50,938
It's not me!

1426
01:38:51,142 --> 01:38:54,155
I'm sorry too, but I am not guilty,
no one is.

1427
01:38:54,353 --> 01:38:57,735
- No one is?
- Somebody but I don't know who.

1428
01:38:58,024 --> 01:39:00,408
So just let him get away!

1429
01:39:00,609 --> 01:39:02,412
Let bygones be bygones, right?

1430
01:39:03,404 --> 01:39:06,417
Don't you dare see Eliza again,
understood?

1431
01:39:06,615 --> 01:39:08,917
- That's not up to you.
- It isn't?

1432
01:39:09,118 --> 01:39:11,170
Are you telling me what to do now?

1433
01:39:11,370 --> 01:39:12,924
Beat it or I'll kill you!

1434
01:39:16,208 --> 01:39:18,296
Lucky you're an old man.

1435
01:40:31,826 --> 01:40:34,294
- Hello, Magda.
- What happened?

1436
01:40:34,620 --> 01:40:37,669
I need to talk to Eliza
but she won't answer.

1437
01:40:38,082 --> 01:40:39,802
Have you talked to her today?

1438
01:40:40,626 --> 01:40:42,014
Have you, Magda?

1439
01:40:42,294 --> 01:40:44,975
- Last night.
- Did she do the exam?

1440
01:40:45,423 --> 01:40:46,514
I don't know.

1441
01:40:47,258 --> 01:40:48,848
I told her to go.

1442
01:40:49,593 --> 01:40:50,886
What happened?

1443
01:40:51,721 --> 01:40:55,647
At 9 she has to see
the rape suspects at the station.

1444
01:40:56,642 --> 01:40:58,481
- What's that?
- I fell.

1445
01:40:59,186 --> 01:41:01,274
I really need to talk to her.

1446
01:41:04,817 --> 01:41:06,703
Wouldn't it be best to wail

1447
01:41:07,319 --> 01:41:10,867
until she calms down,
and wants to talk to you?

1448
01:41:11,490 --> 01:41:13,246
It really can't wait.

1449
01:41:15,369 --> 01:41:16,496
As you wish.

1450
01:41:20,541 --> 01:41:22,427
Can I ask you something?

1451
01:41:23,961 --> 01:41:26,761
Can you give me your keys

1452
01:41:26,964 --> 01:41:29,432
and call ahead when you plan to come?

1453
01:41:33,596 --> 01:41:34,639
Magda...

1454
01:41:36,098 --> 01:41:39,610
How did we become such enemies?
Can you remember?

1455
01:41:44,815 --> 01:41:46,986
Forgive me, I didn't mean it.

1456
01:41:47,193 --> 01:41:48,320
Let me go!

1457
01:41:48,527 --> 01:41:49,951
Forgive me, please.

1458
01:41:50,112 --> 01:41:51,619
Why are you doing this?

1459
01:41:51,822 --> 01:41:54,124
I'm very sorry. Magda...

1460
01:41:57,787 --> 01:41:58,830
I'm sorry.

1461
01:42:06,128 --> 01:42:07,172
Go away.

1462
01:42:14,136 --> 01:42:15,857
Please, go away.

1463
01:43:00,933 --> 01:43:03,519
- Good evening.
- Is something wrong?

1464
01:43:03,728 --> 01:43:04,689
Yes.

1465
01:43:05,563 --> 01:43:09,655
Let's talk after the exam.
And don't come to my home again.

1466
01:43:09,859 --> 01:43:11,745
I know, but it's important.

1467
01:43:12,028 --> 01:43:15,456
A prosecutor visited me.
I thought you should know.

1468
01:43:16,866 --> 01:43:19,037
I didn't find the girl's paper.

1469
01:43:19,243 --> 01:43:21,165
- You didn't find it?
- No.

1470
01:43:21,579 --> 01:43:22,753
So...

1471
01:43:23,164 --> 01:43:24,291
I'm sorry.

1472
01:43:24,498 --> 01:43:26,420
Don't come to my home again.

1473
01:43:27,043 --> 01:43:28,134
I apologize.

1474
01:43:28,335 --> 01:43:29,807
Be careful. Goodbye.

1475
01:43:30,004 --> 01:43:31,096
Goodbye.

1476
01:43:49,982 --> 01:43:51,619
- Good evening.
- Good evening, doctor.

1477
01:43:55,571 --> 01:43:56,615
Doctor?

1478
01:43:56,989 --> 01:43:58,282
Wait a moment!

1479
01:44:05,623 --> 01:44:07,877
Your father did this for you.

1480
01:44:08,334 --> 01:44:10,339
I have no reason to protect him.

1481
01:44:10,753 --> 01:44:12,094
Think carefully.

1482
01:44:13,339 --> 01:44:17,645
My father never asked me
to do anything inappropriate.

1483
01:44:18,094 --> 01:44:19,304
So I don't understand...

1484
01:44:20,054 --> 01:44:21,774
what you're getting at.

1485
01:44:25,726 --> 01:44:26,853
Hello, Eliza.

1486
01:44:27,061 --> 01:44:27,903
Hi.

1487
01:44:28,229 --> 01:44:29,486
What's going on?

1488
01:44:29,689 --> 01:44:30,981
Nothing. Just talking.

1489
01:44:31,732 --> 01:44:32,657
Sandu!

1490
01:44:33,943 --> 01:44:35,829
- Yes, boss.
- Bring them in.

1491
01:44:38,155 --> 01:44:39,033
Are you OK?

1492
01:44:39,240 --> 01:44:40,414
Come on in, please.

1493
01:44:54,088 --> 01:44:56,769
Take your time.
Have a good look.

1494
01:44:57,717 --> 01:44:59,722
Don't worry, they can't see you.

1495
01:45:00,636 --> 01:45:01,810
Ready?

1496
01:45:04,974 --> 01:45:06,148
Look ahead.

1497
01:45:07,143 --> 01:45:08,733
Now turn to me.

1498
01:45:10,396 --> 01:45:11,606
Now back.

1499
01:45:19,739 --> 01:45:20,830
Now, read.

1500
01:45:24,326 --> 01:45:25,501
Get over here.

1501
01:45:25,703 --> 01:45:29,001
Shut it or I'll kill you!
Get your... here, now?

1502
01:45:29,415 --> 01:45:30,459
Step back.

1503
01:45:32,084 --> 01:45:33,295
Next.

1504
01:45:34,336 --> 01:45:35,464
Get over here!

1505
01:45:35,671 --> 01:45:38,435
Shut the fuck up or I'll kill you!

1506
01:45:39,050 --> 01:45:40,640
Get your cunt over here!

1507
01:45:40,843 --> 01:45:41,970
Get it?

1508
01:45:42,344 --> 01:45:43,519
Step back.

1509
01:45:43,971 --> 01:45:46,391
- Want them to say something else?
- No.

1510
01:45:46,766 --> 01:45:48,652
This is what he said, right?

1511
01:45:48,976 --> 01:45:49,771
Yes.

1512
01:45:50,519 --> 01:45:51,647
Shall we go on?

1513
01:45:55,024 --> 01:45:56,151
Next.

1514
01:45:57,610 --> 01:45:58,998
Get over here!

1515
01:45:59,195 --> 01:46:00,748
Shut up! I'll kill you!

1516
01:46:01,113 --> 01:46:02,916
Get your cunt here!
Get it?

1517
01:46:03,115 --> 01:46:04,373
Step back.

1518
01:46:06,327 --> 01:46:07,537
Next.

1519
01:46:10,539 --> 01:46:12,758
Come here!
Shut up! I'll kill you!

1520
01:46:12,958 --> 01:46:14,631
Get your cunt here!
Get it?

1521
01:46:14,835 --> 01:46:15,962
Once again.

1522
01:46:22,301 --> 01:46:23,345
Again.

1523
01:46:28,891 --> 01:46:29,852
Again.

1524
01:46:34,397 --> 01:46:35,239
Again.

1525
01:46:45,658 --> 01:46:47,046
Enough! Enough!

1526
01:46:47,535 --> 01:46:49,456
I'm sorry, Eliza.
I'm sorry.

1527
01:46:57,962 --> 01:47:00,097
If you recognize him, tell us.

1528
01:47:05,511 --> 01:47:07,101
It's none of them.

1529
01:47:09,849 --> 01:47:10,976
Take your time.

1530
01:47:12,059 --> 01:47:15,405
The guy we arrested today
is among them.

1531
01:47:18,733 --> 01:47:20,204
That's not him.

1532
01:47:21,902 --> 01:47:23,113
Are you sure?

1533
01:47:24,947 --> 01:47:26,501
I think so.

1534
01:47:31,037 --> 01:47:31,961
Eliza!

1535
01:47:39,754 --> 01:47:41,391
Eliza, wait!

1536
01:47:44,967 --> 01:47:47,186
Now you're running away from me?

1537
01:47:47,386 --> 01:47:48,513
Let go of me!

1538
01:47:48,721 --> 01:47:51,853
Please, calm down,
I want to talk to you!

1539
01:47:52,058 --> 01:47:53,481
About what?

1540
01:47:53,684 --> 01:47:55,025
Please, Eliza!

1541
01:47:55,227 --> 01:47:57,398
Please?
How could you do that?

1542
01:47:57,605 --> 01:48:00,025
I'm sorry! I'm sorry.

1543
01:48:00,316 --> 01:48:04,871
Sorry? How could you even think
he wouldn't have defended me?

1544
01:48:05,071 --> 01:48:06,957
There're things you don't know.

1545
01:48:07,156 --> 01:48:08,793
I don't need to!

1546
01:48:08,991 --> 01:48:11,495
You can't set out
in life with anyone!

1547
01:48:11,744 --> 01:48:13,666
It's no longer your business!

1548
01:48:14,038 --> 01:48:15,675
And he's not just anyone!

1549
01:48:16,916 --> 01:48:18,802
Fine, Eliza, fine.

1550
01:48:19,710 --> 01:48:22,095
Do what you think is best.

1551
01:48:25,508 --> 01:48:27,310
Can I go now?

1552
01:48:28,094 --> 01:48:28,972
Yes.

1553
01:48:30,596 --> 01:48:33,147
But what did you do
at your exam today?

1554
01:48:34,767 --> 01:48:37,270
I don't even want to talk about it.

1555
01:48:40,356 --> 01:48:41,566
I see.

1556
01:48:44,527 --> 01:48:48,240
You don't have to worry.
I did what I thought was best.

1557
01:48:48,572 --> 01:48:49,960
So it's fine.

1558
01:48:50,908 --> 01:48:51,869
Really?

1559
01:48:53,577 --> 01:48:54,918
Good, Eliza.

1560
01:48:55,788 --> 01:48:56,999
Well done.

1561
01:48:58,040 --> 01:49:00,923
I'm glad you used your own head
to decide.

1562
01:49:02,253 --> 01:49:03,546
I'm glad.

1563
01:49:10,469 --> 01:49:12,889
Are you OK?
Know where you're sleeping?

1564
01:49:13,639 --> 01:49:14,647
I'm OK.

1565
01:49:15,975 --> 01:49:19,072
- Can I give you a ride?
- No, don't worry.

1566
01:49:19,854 --> 01:49:21,242
Just be careful.

1567
01:49:29,739 --> 01:49:31,708
Tomorrow's Open Day at school.

1568
01:49:31,907 --> 01:49:34,328
We're saying goodbye.
You can come...

1569
01:49:36,537 --> 01:49:38,008
Thank you.

1570
01:49:40,916 --> 01:49:42,470
Daddy loves you.

1571
01:49:48,799 --> 01:49:50,092
Take care.

1572
01:50:53,072 --> 01:50:54,329
Open up!

1573
01:54:34,835 --> 01:54:36,176
Thank you.

1574
01:54:37,213 --> 01:54:40,559
- Want some meatballs?
- No, thanks, this is plenty.

1575
01:55:01,195 --> 01:55:03,449
<i>Hound Natal a speech therapist.

1576
01:55:03,656 --> 01:55:05,246
I'll call again tomorrow.

1577
01:55:05,825 --> 01:55:06,833
Thank you.

1578
01:55:08,953 --> 01:55:10,341
You were right.

1579
01:55:10,621 --> 01:55:14,465
I'll enrol him in my school.
It's easier for everyone.

1580
01:55:16,001 --> 01:55:17,045
As you wish.

1581
01:55:23,008 --> 01:55:25,689
- Can I ask you something?
- Go ahead.

1582
01:55:26,971 --> 01:55:29,557
Can you look after Matei
in the morning?

1583
01:55:29,849 --> 01:55:33,195
I'm seeing a doctor,
I don't want him with me.

1584
01:55:35,396 --> 01:55:36,440
Of course.

1585
01:55:37,982 --> 01:55:41,862
There's a park nearby.
He won't be any trouble.

1586
01:55:43,988 --> 01:55:45,032
All right.

1587
01:55:54,373 --> 01:55:56,259
May I take him to school?

1588
01:55:57,918 --> 01:56:01,051
I'm going to Eliza's graduation.

1589
01:56:01,338 --> 01:56:02,466
Take him along.

1590
01:56:04,383 --> 01:56:05,854
Did you two make up?

1591
01:56:06,886 --> 01:56:08,013
I don't know.

1592
01:56:09,388 --> 01:56:10,599
It's difficult.

1593
01:56:11,557 --> 01:56:13,230
Children are like that.

1594
01:56:13,434 --> 01:56:15,854
Yes, you can never know.

1595
01:56:18,022 --> 01:56:20,193
I'll get the couch ready.

1596
01:56:20,649 --> 01:56:22,322
I'm dead tired.

1597
01:56:24,361 --> 01:56:26,201
- Thanks.
- It's OK.

1598
01:56:56,435 --> 01:56:58,238
You have to wait.

1599
01:56:58,437 --> 01:57:00,656
Only one child at a time!

1600
01:57:01,816 --> 01:57:04,402
Please tell your son he has to wait.

1601
01:57:04,610 --> 01:57:06,164
It's fine, madam.

1602
01:57:06,362 --> 01:57:07,915
The instructor said so.

1603
01:57:08,197 --> 01:57:10,202
It's not his responsibility.

1604
01:57:10,449 --> 01:57:11,873
Those are the rules.

1605
01:57:12,076 --> 01:57:16,335
If we apply those rules to kids
they'll never get their turn.

1606
01:57:16,539 --> 01:57:18,259
Maybe when they're older...

1607
01:57:18,457 --> 01:57:21,720
- Tell your son to wait!
- They're kids, lady!

1608
01:57:21,919 --> 01:57:24,007
- Matei!
- Don't throw stones!

1609
01:57:25,339 --> 01:57:26,762
Come over here.

1610
01:57:27,925 --> 01:57:30,310
- Really...
- I'm very sorry.

1611
01:57:30,636 --> 01:57:32,724
- No throwing.
- I apologize.

1612
01:57:32,930 --> 01:57:33,974
Did he hit you?

1613
01:57:35,599 --> 01:57:37,106
Why did you do that?

1614
01:57:37,309 --> 01:57:38,567
He should have waited.

1615
01:57:39,145 --> 01:57:40,568
That's true,

1616
01:57:40,813 --> 01:57:42,533
but you can't act like that.

1617
01:57:42,732 --> 01:57:43,859
Why?

1618
01:57:44,859 --> 01:57:46,994
That's no way to behave.

1619
01:57:47,361 --> 01:57:48,998
So how should I behave?

1620
01:57:50,948 --> 01:57:53,997
It's complicated.
Your mother will explain.

1621
01:57:54,702 --> 01:57:59,044
When you're with me,
never do that, all right?

1622
01:58:01,625 --> 01:58:02,587
Good.

1623
01:58:07,923 --> 01:58:09,893
Let's go, it's getting late.

1624
01:58:19,226 --> 01:58:20,982
Wait here for a moment.

1625
01:58:23,022 --> 01:58:24,612
Good morning, doctor.

1626
01:58:25,483 --> 01:58:26,776
Good morning.

1627
01:58:31,530 --> 01:58:32,788
Hello, Csilla.

1628
01:58:33,491 --> 01:58:34,665
Who's the woman?

1629
01:58:34,867 --> 01:58:36,374
Mr. Bulai's wife.

1630
01:58:36,577 --> 01:58:38,914
He had a heart attack this morning.

1631
01:58:40,122 --> 01:58:42,507
She's waiting to talk to you.

1632
01:58:43,626 --> 01:58:46,509
And the prosecutors are waiting
in my office.

1633
01:58:49,173 --> 01:58:50,015
I see.

1634
01:58:54,470 --> 01:58:55,597
Wish me luck.

1635
01:58:55,805 --> 01:58:57,276
Sok szerencsét.

1636
01:58:57,556 --> 01:58:58,944
That means luck?

1637
01:58:59,141 --> 01:59:00,268
It does.

1638
01:59:04,647 --> 01:59:06,734
I'm so sorry, madam.

1639
01:59:08,734 --> 01:59:10,953
Last night, my husband asked me

1640
01:59:11,237 --> 01:59:13,123
to give you this.

1641
01:59:13,447 --> 01:59:14,835
Madam...

1642
01:59:15,491 --> 01:59:17,876
Please.
It was his wish.

1643
01:59:21,455 --> 01:59:24,469
Thank you. Sorry for your loss.

1644
01:59:25,376 --> 01:59:27,677
Do you have your husband's ID?

1645
01:59:27,878 --> 01:59:28,721
Yes.

1646
01:59:28,921 --> 01:59:30,179
Come along, please.

1647
01:59:32,258 --> 01:59:33,349
Thank you.

1648
01:59:46,856 --> 01:59:48,113
Good morning.

1649
01:59:49,650 --> 01:59:51,406
Did you bring handcuffs?

1650
01:59:51,694 --> 01:59:54,659
Come on, doctor,
we're human too!

1651
01:59:55,614 --> 01:59:57,916
I got this now from Mr. Bulai.

1652
01:59:58,409 --> 02:00:00,295
Will you need it?

1653
02:00:01,495 --> 02:00:03,963
We're just doing our job, don't you see?

1654
02:00:04,165 --> 02:00:06,715
Yes. And it has to be done.

1655
02:00:07,460 --> 02:00:09,465
But you know what we say here:

1656
02:00:09,754 --> 02:00:11,889
No use excising the tumour if...

1657
02:00:12,673 --> 02:00:14,180
We do what we can.

1658
02:00:14,383 --> 02:00:16,602
Will you be here next week?

1659
02:00:16,802 --> 02:00:17,846
Where else?

1660
02:00:18,304 --> 02:00:21,981
Till Monday, then.
The investigation must continue.

1661
02:00:22,183 --> 02:00:23,310
I understand.

1662
02:00:23,809 --> 02:00:26,527
You'll always find me here.

1663
02:00:27,938 --> 02:00:30,572
But let's keep the kids out of it.

1664
02:00:32,777 --> 02:00:35,161
Sure. We'll see...

1665
02:00:36,405 --> 02:00:37,698
Have a good day.

1666
02:00:49,460 --> 02:00:50,421
Let's go.

1667
02:02:21,635 --> 02:02:22,810
Are you OK?

1668
02:02:29,351 --> 02:02:30,526
<i>Mafia.

1669
02:03:12,186 --> 02:03:13,527
Hello, Eliza.

1670
02:03:14,814 --> 02:03:15,775
Hello.

1671
02:03:16,524 --> 02:03:17,615
How are you?

1672
02:03:18,776 --> 02:03:19,784
Fine.

1673
02:03:20,778 --> 02:03:22,498
A bit nervous...

1674
02:03:24,281 --> 02:03:25,788
<i>Hows Mum'?

1675
02:03:26,659 --> 02:03:27,703
She's fine.

1676
02:03:28,369 --> 02:03:30,338
She won't bar the windows after all.

1677
02:03:30,538 --> 02:03:31,629
That's better.

1678
02:03:32,331 --> 02:03:33,209
Yes.

1679
02:03:33,833 --> 02:03:35,838
You get the results on Thursday?

1680
02:03:36,252 --> 02:03:37,130
Yes.

1681
02:03:38,754 --> 02:03:41,222
But I'm not sure I'll leave.

1682
02:03:42,508 --> 02:03:45,308
It would be a pity
but it's your decision.

1683
02:03:49,014 --> 02:03:51,316
Dad, about the exam...

1684
02:03:51,642 --> 02:03:52,686
Yes?

1685
02:03:55,354 --> 02:03:59,696
They let me write a bit longer
after the <i>3</i> hours were up.

1686
02:04:01,402 --> 02:04:02,612
<i>L</i> mean...

1687
02:04:03,487 --> 02:04:05,872
I started crying and they let me.

1688
02:04:08,075 --> 02:04:10,412
So I didn't need to do anything else.

1689
02:04:11,746 --> 02:04:13,038
I see.

1690
02:04:18,043 --> 02:04:19,930
Didn't I do well?

1691
02:04:26,302 --> 02:04:28,354
Can you take a photo? A keepsake?

1692
02:04:28,554 --> 02:04:29,515
Sure.

1693
02:04:41,275 --> 02:04:42,912
Look at me.

1694
02:04:44,695 --> 02:04:45,906
Smile!

1695
02:04:48,949 --> 02:04:50,421
Again...

1696
02:04:52,328 --> 02:04:53,716
Another smile...

1697
02:04:54,288 --> 02:04:55,581
Happier!
