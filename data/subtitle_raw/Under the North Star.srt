VÄINÖ LINNA

2
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,112
What would you do with the marsh?

3
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,834
I would try and clear it.

4
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,117
Put up a croft.

5
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,471
A croft? In raw marshland?

6
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,036
That swamp won't sustain you
for years to come.

7
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,276
If you grant me permission,
that would be all I need.

8
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:01,515
Why not, then.
That has been done before.

9
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,595
Can I have the entire marsh?
-Go and do your will's way.

10
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,156
What about the rental agreement?

11
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,108
Later, later.

12
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:20,148
But remember that your work
is worth nothing without blessing.

13
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,789
Why do they need to be so long?
-For the wall, of course.

14
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:48,596
We'll put this in writing. It will
stay in effect as long as I live.

15
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:56,839
Good day. -If the manor doesn't need
the bricks, I'd like to buy them.

16
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,430
We don't have a name for it yet.

17
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,269
Sure we do.
-What is it?

18
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,754
It's Koskela!

19
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,471
UNDER THE NORTH STAR

20
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,272
I've never seen such grain.

21
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,509
A right thug he is.
Hands like a lumberjack's -

22
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,792
and balls so large that
he could go courting right away.

23
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,591
Would you just look at
that tiny fist.

24
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,350
How are you, Akseli?
-I see he has a name already.

25
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,473
He's had one for long now.
Akseli Johannes.

26
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,470
Now he's dead.
-Right.

TIMO KOIVUSALO

28
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,789
How did he die?

29
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,316
Around three this afternoon.

30
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,992
He had asked to be seated and
said he cannot breathe on his back.

31
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:22,431
They lifted him, but he went limp
and died in their arms.

32
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,639
Better for him to be at peace.
He was in such pain.

33
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,392
Right.
-What are those?

34
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,352
His son, the judge, wants me to
drive the coffin to the churchyard.

35
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:41,191
These are his brother's old clothes.
-Take it off! It's not a toy.

36
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,070
All right, go eat.

37
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:52,992
He was so good to us.
May he rest in peace.

38
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:59,590
But what's next for us?
-What would it change into?

39
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,315
Anything.

40
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,591
A clergyman wouldn't demand
the impossible.

41
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,555
Who knows... Priests and preachers,
they're all the same.

42
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:20,193
Should I massage it?
-No!

43
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,751
It will only make it worse.

44
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,712
Will the new Pastor
come and live here?

45
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:35,755
How so? -Because father
is afraid we'll have to leave.

46
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,190
He's not going to come here.

47
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,834
God will let us keep this place.
Now go to sleep.

48
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,990
May we eat these right away?
-Change your clothes first.

49
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:38,674
Keep the wrappers. Father will make
a wooden filling for them -

50
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,519
and we'll keep them
in memory of the Pastor.

51
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,995
Is he going to Heaven
from the grave?

52
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,998
Yes, on the last day
when the dead will rise.

53
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,271
When is the last day?
-When Jesus comes.

54
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:55,560
When will Jesus come?
-Only God knows that.

55
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,236
Thirteen years
and such large fields already?

56
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,911
It's not all good land, you know.

57
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,310
But if the Pastor would continue
the lease... -Not to worry.

58
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,552
Let everything remain
as it is for now.

59
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,752
This is bigger
than many farmhouses.

60
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,952
He even has five head of cattle,
the bastard.

61
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,789
And the rent is next to nothing.

62
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,952
That's no business of mine,
entirely up to the Pastor.

63
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:57,115
The rent is cheap, but the farm
has been built up from marshland.

64
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,834
Inherited crofts are different.

65
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:03,475
All this in 13 years.
Quite an accomplishment.

66
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:09,755
Mister Pastor... the contract...
When would be a good time?

67
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,836
I'll let you know,
let's let it lie for the moment.

68
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,713
We'll get back to that later.

69
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:25,750
Jussi Koskela has made himself
a little fortune in a short time.

70
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:30,431
That's all fine and easy.
Just look at the Laurilas.

71
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,155
Living on other people's land
and sucking it dry.

72
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,192
That's not really my problem.

73
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:42,519
But it's the congregation's land
that is being exploited.

74
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,916
No wonder
the parsonage is losing money.

75
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:51,158
My predecessor's heirs recommend
that I continue the lease -

76
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,590
and we will certainly do that.

77
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,713
It would be very good for us.
It's our home, like.

78
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:03,675
The contract will be temporary
for now. -But... Why?

79
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,674
It is hard, when you
don't know for how long.

80
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:13,591
I don't mean to worsen the deal. You
can live there while I'm in office.

81
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,553
But I don't want to
bind my followers.

82
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,989
The rent will remain the same.

83
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,918
So we can live there?

84
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,999
You will have the right to live
in the croft and use its lands -

85
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:30,636
as long as the parsonage's
economy doesn't suffer.

86
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:35,356
But that does away with...

87
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,072
Whatever contract we make -

88
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,631
we are bound
by the parish council's decisions.

89
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:50,390
Of course. But if the Pastor says...

90
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:54,069
I consider this a binding agreement.

91
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:03,149
We have a real lord and master now.

92
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,035
But he gave us
the right to live here.

93
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,596
Unless the parsonage's benefit
states otherwise.

94
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,234
It wasn't any better in the old one.

95
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,954
And the rent-work...

96
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,635
They can't come up with so much -

97
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:24,670
that these three couldn't do it in
a couple of years... Mummy's men.

98
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,348
Are you from the parsonage?
-Yes, I am.

99
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,876
But where is my husb... the Pastor?

100
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,749
We meant to come together,
the Pastor told me to explain.

101
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,954
There wasn't enough room
in the carriage. -How unfortunate.

102
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,394
Wait, you son of a bitch!

103
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,394
God damn it!

104
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:59,756
Is there an elementary school here?
-Yes, in the church village.

105
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:03,395
There are plans
to build one in Pentinkulma too.

106
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:08,555
Are the people patriotic here?
-I really don't know.

107
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,029
Daddy!

108
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,511
Ani!

109
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,995
Finally!

110
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,872
Ilmari.

111
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,752
Wait, here's something for you.

112
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,668
Thank you, but I'm doing rent-work.
It's not necessary.

113
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,837
Right, right. Koskela is your name?

114
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:47,351
Well, that's what they call me.
In the books it's Antinpoika.

115
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:51,877
Lauri, you should make Koskela
this man's official family name.

116
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,278
Certainly, my little patriot,
right away.

117
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,275
Give it!

118
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,235
Give it here!

119
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,513
What's this thing with the name?

120
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:16,510
I hope it's no scheme that the
contract is under a different name?

121
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:21,037
Let him hold it for a while.
-No, because it's mine.

122
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,754
Give it right away.
-No!

123
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,960
You need to get involved here.

124
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,554
Did you hear your mother?
-I found it, it's mine.

125
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:39,233
One more time: will you do
what your mother tells you?

126
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,318
Kill me... if you want to!

127
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,635
Not so hard...

128
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,672
I've never seen a brat like that!

129
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,309
You must stop the whippings.
It's just too terrible.

130
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,399
He had bumps
as wide as a finger.

131
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:22,798
The world doesn't mind, it
strikes you down without mercy.

132
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,349
Just try kindly first.

133
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,437
Sometimes I praise him
for a job well done -

134
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,235
and he's quietly pleased
even though he doesn't show it.

135
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:39,032
No reason to praise him for working.
Work is a thing of nature.

136
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:51,637
We came to see Halme talk,
since we didn't even need tickets.

137
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,520
He took our son as an apprentice.

138
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:58,428
Our Valenti might become
a master tailor.

139
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,199
Halme is a wise man.

140
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:06,474
This nation has slumbered
for centuries, but now it is waking.

141
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,718
May the ideal of the fire brigade
elevate them from that slumber.

142
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:16,551
Let it flood like a spring brook,
ever stronger, growing and rising -

143
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:22,391
in all our hearts, for the benefit
of our northern fatherland.

144
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,793
We are pleased to see -

145
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,629
that our gentry
is advanced in their views.

146
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:36,916
Especially the poor are elated. They
have not been entirely forgotten.

147
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:46,113
I wish to thank Halme
for these words.

148
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,597
The fire brigade idea was his,
and thanks is due to him.

149
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,317
Why the Hell should we thank him?

150
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:11,993
Well, Halme is a good speaker.
You can tell he reads <i>The Workman</i>.

151
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,033
The poor don't have any use
for a fire brigade.

152
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:21,837
There's no such rush that a worker
couldn't gather up his scraps.

153
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,955
Goddamnit, how they try!

154
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:39,548
Rocks are left in the field
so that it would be hell to work!

155
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,710
Go tell your father
I'm sitting and smoking.

156
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:50,119
Why would he want to know?
-I don't know.

157
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:56,073
I guess he needs to know,
since he's put you to spy on me.

158
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:03,234
I must sharpen this sucker
to earn more money for the boss!

159
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:11,670
I'm only going to say this once.
Don't scare my boy.

160
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,633
You know I am a man of my word.

161
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:19,788
You really are, especially
when it comes to rent-work.

162
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,151
But when you got the house
from your father-

163
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,431
you gave us a lifelong lease
on the croft.

164
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:30,394
I did, but with the condition
that you behave!

165
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,269
Will you be decent,
or do I have to say it?

166
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,995
Say what you want,
but I'm not leaving.

167
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,870
Good Lord.

168
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,115
Let's meet them outside
so they don't have to wait.

169
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:01,479
Did you clear all this alone?
-Well, it's fair to say I did.

170
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,752
We ought to get Koskela a medal
from the farming society.

171
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,713
You said it.
We shall do that right away.

172
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:12,469
No need.
This is little compared to...

173
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:18,072
This is well worth a medal.
You must get along quite well now.

174
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,478
The land feeds us...
But we work hard.

175
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,319
Our wilds have always been
cleared like this.

176
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,831
That is why Finns
are tougher than any other nation.

177
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:34,192
You little settlers.
Come here now.

178
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,117
Thank the nice lady.
-Thank you.

179
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,229
It is good to think of you
continuing your father's work.

180
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:55,718
I trust you'll give your
contribution when the time comes.

181
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:02,190
They are doing better than us.
How many tax days does Koskela do?

182
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,312
Two with horse and one on foot.

183
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,275
Isn't that rather little?
Couldn't we increase their days?

184
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,678
It doesn't feel appropriate.
-What's inappropriate about it?

185
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,509
That is the reason we're losing
money over the parsonage.

186
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,677
They can do a couple of days more.

187
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,520
A cuckoo!

188
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,638
Six times, did you hear?

189
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:34,514
What a lovely country we have.

190
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,189
We must speak kindly to them.

191
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:47,433
How many days did you have in mind?
-Shall we say... six?

192
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,798
I heard a cuckoo. Six times!

193
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:54,071
Only six times?

194
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:59,558
He could have sung more
while he was at it.

195
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:07,678
What would Koskela say,
if I asked him for a little help?

196
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,678
What kind of help do you mean?

197
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:16,078
Would Koskela object strongly
if we added his tax days?

198
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,398
Not a lot, just some help days
during the summer.

199
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,318
Say, six women's days.

200
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,636
If the Pastor says so,
we must accept...

201
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,196
It's not a command,
it's a request.

202
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:36,030
The contract states
that we both must agree.

203
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,158
We can do as much as we can.

204
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,551
As long as we can live there.

205
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:52,559
The lady is in control, and the
man cannot keep his own head.

206
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,878
We're not done for yet.

207
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,198
And Akseli is already
as strong as a grown man.

208
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:04,712
My back can still support
one family of gentry.

209
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:10,790
It would be fine
without their army of maids.

210
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:22,915
Could you do a bit more,
that strip over there?

211
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,838
It's all in the bank.

212
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,748
Where is it going?
-It's going to hit us.

213
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:47,278
It will go to the parsonage.
-I can see it's coming, can't I?

214
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,951
It's Osku's turn!

215
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,668
Who hit you?

216
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,593
Well? Who was it?

217
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,474
Arvo Töyry,
you tell me what happened.

218
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,557
He fought with Akseli Koskela.

219
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,717
I see. Sit down.

220
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,191
Akseli Koskela, on your feet!

221
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,870
Look what you did
to this boy's face.

222
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:41,440
Do you hear me?
Apologise at once. Apologise!

223
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,753
You little brat!

224
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,350
Am I supposed to turn
you vermin into people?

225
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,952
Osku, stop it!

226
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,878
Leave your sister alone. Elina is
the only one here with any manners.

227
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,996
A pair of skis for our godson.
No need to fight anymore.

228
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:17,114
Mind you, the only education I got
was a beating now and then. -Thanks.

229
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,954
Well, thank you.

230
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,795
Dear neighbours.

231
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,629
You must have heard of
the emperor's manifesto -

232
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,275
overturning our country's
constitutional rights.

233
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:55,439
We are gathering names
for a people's petition.

234
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:02,119
Please, would you sign it.
-Of course. It's important.

235
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,438
Although Finland is
a grand duchy of Russia -

236
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:09,348
the Emperor cannot betray
the will of the Finnish people.

237
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:15,119
I don't know about signatures.
I never learned that skill.

238
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,595
Surely you can write, Mr Laurila.

239
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:22,840
Sometimes I can, sometimes I can't.
I don't care for constitutions.

240
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,909
The constitution secures your
freedom. -It hasn't done so before.

241
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:33,319
Besides, the lands will soon be
divided up according to Russian law.

242
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,798
That is a lie meant to divide
the people. How can you believe it?

243
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,870
It's as believable as anything.
-Are you implying that I'm lying?

244
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:53,429
We're not implying anything. Our
constitution is master Töyry's word.

245
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,990
We're talking about the fatherland.-
Indeed.

246
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,875
The fatherland doesn't beg for
what it needs. It demands it.

247
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:17,598
Goodness me.
Welcome, welcome.

248
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:21,117
I knew the gentry were coming,
by the bell ringing.

249
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,789
Didn't even have time
to clean the house.

250
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,312
We have quite a few animals now...

251
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,034
Sit down, please.
-Thank you, no.

252
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:36,393
I'd like you to sign a petition.
-We'll thank the emperor in church.

253
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:40,877
We don't want to thank him.
The emperor has broken his vow.

254
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,798
Has he gone and done that too?

255
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,832
Wouldn't you like to sign after all?

256
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,317
If the madam wants our names...

257
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:56,715
Writing to the emperor, oh my.

258
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:02,230
I am theoretically
in favour of this petition.

259
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,432
There is only one mistake.

260
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:10,953
The workers' stewards
have been entirely surpassed.

261
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:15,269
But the issue at hand
is not at dispute, is it?

262
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,278
You will sign, right?

263
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:24,236
Yes, of course. I'll sign the
petition as an individual.

264
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:35,630
The bosses don't care what the lower
classes think about the fatherland.

265
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:56,550
You won't get to go another time,
so you know.

266
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,718
You kids will not be
running off at will.

267
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,230
Yes... Is your back hurting bad?

268
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:07,432
Why would it be any better?

269
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:17,118
Well, what did you do?
-Played games and made a bomb.

270
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:22,109
Uncle Otto made one into a pipe
and lit it. -Well, some folks.

271
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,869
Just blowing up
their way through life.

272
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:29,510
It's a new century.
-So it is.

273
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:35,556
But don't go emptying that meat cup.

274
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,913
I believe we need to eat
in this century as well.

275
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,915
Akseli Koskela is driving
a mowing machine!

276
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,079
On the parsonage fields.

277
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:12,478
Many don't know
a thing about machines.

278
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,232
The parsonage is losing money.
-We must cut our expenses.

279
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,555
We have too much staff.

280
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:27,593
We can give up the parlour maid,
but that's a drop in the ocean.

281
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:32,714
We should live less extravagantly.
This is inappropriate for my office.

282
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:37,311
I'm the only priest in the church of
Finland with a two-horse carriage.

283
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,309
All that was bought
with my parents' inheritance.

284
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:50,712
There is one way, but it's not easy.
-What?

285
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:55,072
The parsonage has a tenancy
almost as big as the parsonage.

286
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,795
We could reclaim some of its lands.

287
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,957
That will not do.

288
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,277
We must do something,
you know that.

289
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:22,428
I could take away a tenancy from
anyone else easily, but not Koskela.

290
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,955
I've begun to admire
him during these years.

291
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:31,790
He fears rain on the parsonage
fields as much as his own.

292
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,033
Why won't you understand?
-I understand!

293
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:40,234
But I expect my husband
to support me and my children.

294
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:44,359
How will we pay for
Ilmari's studies?

295
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,554
Give me strength.

296
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:12,751
<i>The world took away my joy</i>

297
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:18,557
<i>And left me with a bosom of woe</i>

298
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:25,872
<i>Should the kantele still be playing</i>

299
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:31,996
<i>No joy will ever live in its sound</i>

300
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,869
This is becoming ridiculous.
-Ridiculous? I've run out of tears.

301
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,639
Let's talk.
We're a husband and wife.

302
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,833
I'm alone with my children,
who have no future.

303
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,872
Ellen, let's stop this.

304
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,275
I've been thinking it over.

305
00:30:55,400 --> 00:31:00,520
Do you really believe I'd think it,
if I didn't feel it is justified?

306
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:04,470
Maybe we can reach an agreement.

307
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,678
The parish council
has been thinking -

308
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:17,318
that the parsonage should get some
land back from Koskela. A little.

309
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,597
About four hectares, no more.

310
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:25,077
That's a good third of the croft's
land and half of the best land.

311
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,670
But you will be left
with a whole lot.

312
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:33,157
It's also good for you
to cut down on your work.

313
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:36,829
I just thought...

314
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,909
There's nothing I can do,
if you want to take it.

315
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,999
Crying won't make it any better.

316
00:31:55,640 --> 00:32:01,795
I just feel sorry for father.
He didn't sleep a wink last night.

317
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,959
Staying up won't make it
better either. The land's gone!

318
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:10,119
Easy to say. If you had done
all this yourself like father...

319
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,596
But if it is God's will...

320
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:18,430
Don't drag God into it.
God doesn't need our marsh.

321
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:23,429
It's that damned priest that's
taking them. -Hold your tongue!

322
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,839
You'll have to accept God's will
at some point in your life.

323
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,077
Any crime is explained away
with the help of God.

324
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:37,354
But I won't bow to land-robbers.
-Come on now!

325
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,871
He is a servant of God, after all.

326
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,120
He's a servant to the Devil.
And to the greatest Devil there is.

327
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,438
Have you stopped working altogether?
-Not yet, but soon.

328
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:00,950
I can't stop.
Now I'll have to work twice as hard.

329
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:06,757
They can take all they will.
-Why bust your back for others?

330
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:12,113
Don't go causing trouble.
We'll all be kicked out!

331
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,835
Good morning.
It's turned out beautiful again.

332
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,548
Good morning.

333
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,075
Why won't Akseli answer?

334
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,476
It's not part of our rent-work
to say good morning.

335
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,358
Take it easy.
We must keep up!

336
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,115
I must hurry,
or the bosses will go hungry.

337
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:53,109
He's not angry about the lands.
He's just a difficult person.

338
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:59,474
He's a good workman. As good
as his father, if not better.

339
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:05,435
If we continue the contract, I want
the tenancy to go to the middle son.

340
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,870
He's easier in all respects.

341
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,675
I'm here on the master's errand.

342
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,712
There's a meeting tomorrow
at the firehouse.

343
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,274
What's happening?
-Great things.

344
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:26,439
The country is on strike,
they're demanding a new parliament-

345
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:31,429
and that the lands be dealt anew and
the tenants freed. -Strike here too!

346
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:36,429
Leave the dungforks alone!
-Take it easy tomorrow.

347
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:41,157
People of Finland! We are caught
in the middle of great events.

348
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,397
The Finnish people
want back their rights.

349
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:48,877
There is a strike on
against Russian oppression.

350
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,073
If we're on strike,
why are the masters here?

351
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:58,957
This is a national strike.
I ask the Pastor to explain more.

352
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:03,710
It's a national strike.
All classes of society are involved.

353
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,354
Also the officials are on strike.

354
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:12,510
We have no reason to strike here,
but we must show our support.

355
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:20,357
If the bosses are on strike now,
what did they do before?

356
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:26,789
They have the most at stake: their
offices, their future, even freedom.

357
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,992
A strike won't do here.

358
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:35,399
Animals must be fed and cows milked
in any case.

359
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:41,750
May I enquire when will the crofts'
contracts be legitimised?

360
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,519
This is no time to
stir up class hatred.

361
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,030
There is hope of
general suffrage at last.

362
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:52,751
We don't need to strike here.
We would only be harming ourselves.

363
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,270
A strike must not to be used
to create chaos and anarchy.

364
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,757
Why are the factories on strike if
the strike is against the Russians?

365
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:05,431
The bosses against the emperor, the
workers against the factory bosses.

366
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:08,472
It just happens to take place
at the same time.

367
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:13,231
The goals are national.
We want oppression to end.

368
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:16,318
There are many types of oppressors.

369
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:20,319
To my amazement,
there is discord about the strike.

370
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:23,477
The old parliament
must return to power.

371
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:27,878
But it must immediately pass a new
election law and disperse again.

372
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,393
Are you sure this 'cash parliament'
will make the reform?

373
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,557
Us radicals, Mr Halme and myself,
guarantee it.

374
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:39,877
We will go on strike again
unless a reform is passed.

375
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:46,235
Dear madam. In that case, I think
only one radical would be on strike:

376
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:49,193
Mr Halme.

377
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:03,475
It's best just to see how it goes.

378
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:07,189
These are big issues, you know.

379
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:14,477
People like us need to be careful.

380
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:19,276
Halme should have started a strike
without the bosses.

381
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:23,279
We're on strike for the tenants.
The priest should stay away.

382
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,198
We're in for rough times.

383
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:30,871
The hotter the situation gets,
the more tenants will be evicted.

384
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,437
They couldn't do that.
Where would all the people go?

385
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:41,710
Do you think the bosses care?
They wouldn't give a damn.

386
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:45,674
Finland's roads are still
littered with beggars.

387
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:51,113
We need to do something. -You go
to rent-work tomorrow and be nice.

388
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:55,916
If we get the vote, we'll give
the lords a run for their money.

389
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,919
I must start reading them books
and newspapers myself.

390
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,071
Akseli.

391
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:08,194
I'm building a grain store
at Kylä-Pentti. Come help me out.

392
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:12,632
Dig the pit.
I'll pay you a little money.

393
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,074
The bosses took a clear victory.
The strike is over.

394
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:27,995
They are assembling at the
municipal hall. Shall we go?

395
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:34,468
We'll celebrate another time,
and the gentry will not be cheering.

396
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,592
If we had started
a strike together...

397
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,598
In Helsinki, the Students' Guard -

398
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:44,952
threatened to shoot
at the Red Guard during the strike.

399
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:51,952
They're ready to spill blood when
squashing the workers' demands!

400
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,715
We must retaliate!

401
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,832
Violence is a foreign tool
to the working man.

402
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:02,875
The working man will use
any tools necessary to gain power.

403
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:10,029
What are people up to at Pentinkulma
village? -They're ignorant.

404
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:14,199
You must found a
Workers' Association there.

405
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,190
That I'll certainly do.

406
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:30,677
Halme speaks about socialism, but he
hangs around the gentry too much.

407
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:35,396
We should educate the baron
about the rent-work.

408
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:40,197
The tenants won't be freed by
running around in a fire brigade.

409
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:44,393
Join the Workers' Association's
Board of Directors, father.

410
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:48,115
Where does that enthusiasm
come from?

411
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,994
I didn't know you read books.

412
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:58,514
Think about it. If we get the vote,
we must get people to vote.

413
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,513
And if we get the majority, the
tenants' condition will be fixed -

414
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:06,438
and no more goddamn rent-work.

415
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:12,515
What is that? I have enough
to keep this household going.

416
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:17,914
It's not for the household,
it's for you.

417
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:21,471
Oh, you poor boy.

418
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,798
Buy something for yourself.

419
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:28,074
What ever do I need?

420
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:33,509
I must put in a little praise
for my own work with that suit.

421
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,678
It's not common to feel pride -

422
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:41,669
when clothing this
rickets-stricken nation.

423
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:49,353
Higher tailoring is a form of art.
It's a joy to see it on you.

424
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:57,595
But your understanding of socialism
is skewed. -What's it like then?

425
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:04,717
Its purpose is not to burn and
destroy, but to create and maintain.

426
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:10,599
Thereby a fire brigade is important.

427
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:14,599
Bosses or no bosses.
-I see.

428
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:22,038
Stop messing with that lunatic!

429
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,670
God damn this life.

430
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,998
One lunatic is not enough, but the
others have to be a bunch of devils.

431
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,998
Is Elma hiding behind all that hair?

432
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:36,432
We don't have time to groom
our children, like some people.

433
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:40,473
Pretty girl. No use to keep hair
all over her face.

434
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:44,559
What good is the Association,
if we can't get any help from it?

435
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:48,229
Let's try one more time.
-We have to leave for sure.

436
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:51,397
This plot will be a shop
for his brother.

437
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,717
It's no use going there
and shooting off your mouth.

438
00:41:54,840 --> 00:42:00,517
So there are no outstanding rents?
-Every damned day has been paid for.

439
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:11,194
It's clear as day. I have the right
to issue an eviction.

440
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,238
But is it absolutely necessary?

441
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:19,195
I will not tolerate
back chat from my tenant.

442
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:23,916
I'm going to chat back as long as
you keep up your game.

443
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:28,875
You wouldn't have coped without me,
and you know it.

444
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,391
What has the world come to, coming
in folks' homes raising trouble?

445
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,193
We don't want to order you around.

446
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:39,471
But Laurila has
some rights to his croft, no?

447
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:43,559
When did you become a juror,
Kivivuori?

448
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:48,151
I've said all there is to say.
That land is mine.

449
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:52,353
You're out in the spring.
Others need not interfere.

450
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,472
Laurila has the right
to seek our assistance.

451
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:59,673
He is a member of the Association.
Socialism gives him the right.

452
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:03,873
We know nothing of the
disease of socialism in this house.

453
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,279
If you're not out by the due date,
the coppers will empty the croft.

454
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:14,599
Right it is then! There's your ten
marks for that one seed of barley!

455
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:18,076
Keep it, and go to Hell with it!

456
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:21,829
And I won't do any more work,
I'm on strike!

457
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,838
Then the eviction will be
implemented sooner.

458
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,430
You'll only get me
on the road feet first!

459
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:32,235
There's the front door, use it.

460
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:38,074
The Workers' Association
will not sit still for this.

461
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:51,079
I'm making a flagpole for the cause.

462
00:43:55,840 --> 00:44:01,710
Soon we'll fight the oppressor
behind Emma Halme's red underskirt.

463
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,315
Although Anttoo is bound
to lose his case.

464
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:11,753
What good is it then? -It shows
people the tenant's position.

465
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:15,555
It's nothing less than serfdom.

466
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:20,276
Come, Akseli. Let's go courting.
-Why would I want to come?

467
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:24,433
I think Akseli has plans
about our girl here.

468
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:29,714
He's begun to lift up her skirt
a bit. -You're terrible, father.

469
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:33,435
Look at the girl, gone all red.

470
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:31,119
What is the purpose of this group?
And who has authorized this?

471
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:36,792
The group will follow
the destruction of a comrade's home.

472
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:42,153
The authority is that which is
granted to us by the law of Finland.

473
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:45,272
This is an illegal demonstration.

474
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,914
Do not approach
the site of the eviction.

475
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:50,838
If you do,
the consequences are on your head.

476
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:53,793
We will not interfere
with your work.

477
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:59,119
What are you doing here? -I'm a
reporter. This is a public eviction.

478
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:02,755
All right. But don't get involved.

479
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:29,078
Do you wish the order
to be followed?

480
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:32,351
I've said what I've said,
and I'm sticking to it.

481
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:37,679
Anton Kustaa Laurila, I urge you and
your family to vacate this building.

482
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:42,237
If you don't leave,
the troopers will have to act.

483
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:47,838
Kill all of us right away.
But I'm not leaving. That's final.

484
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:53,080
Anttoo, if you promise to leave
in three days, I can wait.

485
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:59,389
You'll have to drag me away
piece by piece, you bandit.

486
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:03,354
For the last time.
Get up from that chair, Laurila!

487
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:06,358
The chair stays under my arse!

488
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,473
Unhinge the doors and windows,
destroy the stove.

489
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:15,276
Ma'am, clothe your children.
-Let them freeze!

490
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:20,599
They have no place in this world.
Let's all go to Hell together!

491
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:24,793
Bring rope and handcuffs.
Take this man outside!

492
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:27,673
Jesus shit!

493
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:30,998
We're going to Hell, all of us.

494
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,673
Goddamn!
I won't tolerate this.

495
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:54,317
Come what may, let's go!
-Stay still!

496
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:02,239
My God, comrades, keep calm!

497
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:11,472
You devil! Driving children
out into the cold!

498
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:17,197
Laugh it up, you had your will!
I'd like to tear your eyes out!

499
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:22,440
Your ass is like two stale cookies
in a sack! But have a look at this!

500
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:26,599
Ugly!
-Take this!

501
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,876
Antti, no!

502
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:59,438
Break up that screaming bunch!

503
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:03,875
This is a peaceful
and legitimate gathering!

504
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:09,713
Comrades, return to the road.

505
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:13,509
Let's go already.

506
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:19,758
Akseli, take the flag to the road.
They are whipping us!

507
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:23,475
Go on, this is no use anymore.
The group will break up.

508
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,788
Comrades,
let's march to the firehouse.

509
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:49,314
"This tenant farmer was torn
out of his home with violence -

510
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:52,557
after slaving for his master
year after year."

511
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:58,516
"The flag of socialism flew high on
the steely arms of a young hero..."

512
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:04,829
What a hero. Carrying around a flag.
What good did that do?

513
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:09,715
The croft is empty
and Anttoo is going to prison.

514
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:14,277
What is he writing?
-Arms of steel...

515
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,993
Subscribing to papers like that.

516
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:23,193
Some flibbertigibbet
is making a fortune.

517
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:26,198
Writing rubbish by day -

518
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:29,471
and drinking away
people's money by night.

519
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:32,553
Arms of steel...

520
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:42,876
Good day. Sofa there.

521
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:52,149
You people make trouble
with the police. -Dear sir.

522
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:56,273
The trouble was caused by the
police, not by the demonstrators.

523
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:01,030
This concern me: my men
off work without permission.

524
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:06,598
Another thing, to you the firehouse
is like a Socialist House.

525
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:11,550
Dear sir, considering that the house
is located on your property -

526
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:17,073
and built out of your wood, you
naturally have authority over it.

527
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:23,315
If one more time my men go off work
and walk on road with song and flag.

528
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,510
Then those men away!

529
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:30,031
As the great Tolstoy says...
-Tolstoy not do my men's work!

530
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,116
Magnus?

531
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:34,709
<i>Wait!</i>

532
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:37,072
Dear sir.

533
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:41,751
Despite our long hours,
we have all night to assemble -

534
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:44,997
and we will find a space
for that purpose.

535
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:51,229
I'm sorry that we disagree.
Goodbye.

536
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:03,468
The battle is escalating.

537
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:08,196
The baron is placing all his might
against the Association.

538
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:14,037
We will not be getting reforms
through peaceful means.

539
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:32,917
Leave the collar longer, so he can
steal hay from the next horse.

540
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:38,598
Well, let's grab hands
now that we started.

541
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:42,508
Is it real gold?

542
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:48,196
The chain is gold, but the watch is
silver and only gold plated.

543
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:51,198
Are you going to go
courting tonight, Aleksi?

544
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:55,996
This one's ready in mind and body.
-What are you doing, boy?

545
00:52:56,120 --> 00:53:00,671
I'm teaching her to fear her arse,
so she'll be a little shy with it.

546
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:07,638
What good-for-nothings.
They embarrass me every time.

547
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:12,390
What lip.
Where have they learned it?

548
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:23,879
Dear youths. The perils and joys
of adult life await you.

549
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:30,239
But if you hold this sacred moment
as your guide -

550
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:37,630
your lives will be blessed,
whatever lies in wait for you.

551
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,959
The body of Christ...
The blood of Christ...

552
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:10,717
That fence
will not stay there forever.

553
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:15,436
Halme said that with
80 socialists in the parliament -

554
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:20,634
old evictions will be nullified.
-Don't believe everything he says.

555
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:27,228
He's just organising
one work party after another.

556
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:30,678
We have our own work, you know.

557
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:54,034
Come learn a few steps, Aksu.
Take the girl for a swing.

558
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:58,677
We were going to build the people's
hall. Let's dance when it's ready.

559
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:03,396
That's man's talk.
Those two are just messing about.

560
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,753
Let us dance then, mother.

561
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:18,758
Terrible. Behave now.

562
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:24,433
Our Janne is marrying Sanni.

563
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:27,870
Right, they're starting
a thirty-year war.

564
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,594
It doesn't need to be war.

565
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:33,678
You're like Osku.
You never say anything nice.

566
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:38,078
I don't like you at all.
-I can't help that.

567
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:42,557
I'm as good as I'm going to get.
I'm just my own simple self.

568
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:47,391
I didn't... You are always so crude.
-That's just me!

569
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:50,751
I don't want to act
any better than I am.

570
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:03,833
Let's have more red, Valpri!

571
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,312
You've had her for sure.
-No way.

572
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:16,951
I've just squeezed her about.
-Don't talk rubbish.

573
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:32,719
I'd walk you home,
but I don't want Osku to know.

574
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:37,709
I don't like Osku,
I like them different.

575
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:41,477
If you don't tell Osku,
I'll walk you.

576
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:44,068
You're one...

577
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:46,953
What of me?
I'm just the normal kind.

578
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:50,675
Say nothing.
Everybody knows how you are.

579
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:53,874
I must go home.

580
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:58,153
Don't hurry. We have all evening.
-It's cold.

581
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:04,076
Let's go to the sauna to warm up.
-It's not warm.

582
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:19,197
You should have been a fiddler
with fingers like that.

583
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:28,398
Who would have known at school
that we'd end up being a couple.

584
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:30,954
Don't fuss now.

585
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:50,115
What are you doing?
The others are mowing!

586
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:55,035
They're behind in the work.
They have to work during the break.

587
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:58,436
Get up and go to work.
-I have to take a breather.

588
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:01,672
I said go to work, right now!

589
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:05,236
Man and horse, both as lazy.

590
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:09,911
It's like he reads
<i>People's newspaper</i>too, isn't it?

591
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:14,392
I will not let this lie.
-I see.

592
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:17,872
I will.

593
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:26,479
You spoke to the steward
against the manor.

594
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:29,433
You do bad rent-work.
-Mr Baron, sir.

595
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:35,078
Rent-work is piecework. It's enough
that the contract is filled.

596
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:38,397
And when it comes to speaking;
go get your book, son.

597
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:42,513
Doesn't it say all Finnish
citizens have freedom of speech?

598
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:46,030
I don't want your books,
I want your work.

599
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:49,470
You don't take care of croft,
only People's hall.

600
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:53,275
Your rye still green,
while manor's rye very ripe.

601
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:57,029
Even God knows
who needs the rye first.

602
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:00,914
Up when you speak to me!
Take off cap!

603
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:04,237
No manners, like hooligans.

604
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:09,952
This day next year, you out!
-Mr baron.

605
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:14,995
We call a hooligan someone who
raises trouble in people's homes.

606
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:21,309
You don't enter a house without
permission. Not to brawl anyway.

607
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:25,673
Dear ladies,
I apologise my excitement.

608
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:30,069
And you, who is
man of the house, fired.

609
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:33,237
Too much is too much.

610
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:47,396
Magnus Gabriel came to see how
Finland's agriculture is developing.

611
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:50,034
Now we'll show him.

612
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:55,029
Are you that far ahead?
I didn't even notice.

613
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:59,279
I hired that young man
to do my strip.

614
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:02,955
Do you intend to beat the steward?

615
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:06,032
The baron's minion
will be beaten down today.

616
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:10,392
What has the baron ever done to you?
-Not to me. But to you.

617
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:15,116
So you're mowing for my sake?
-Yours too.

618
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:26,392
For the manor's honour! Parsonage
boy goes too much in front.

619
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:30,069
The boy hasn't read
<i>The People's Newspaper</i>.

620
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:35,991
Some teach their horses to do that.
-Your every word nasty!

621
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:41,035
Leave the worksite, don't come back!
-Not even for rent-work?

622
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:46,553
You go this year without rent,
then you away. That's it.

623
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:50,230
Remember what you promised me.
You all heard it!

624
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:53,989
My word needs no witness.
Go away!

625
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:00,599
Damn, boy.
You'll get your due reward for this.

626
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:55,510
I'd like a word.
-We need to have that word then.

627
01:01:57,360 --> 01:02:01,148
Right... About Elina and me.

628
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:04,913
What about you?

629
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:11,108
You know well enough.
-How would I know what you're up to?

630
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:15,199
We've been thinking...
I'll marry Elina!

631
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:20,470
I see. Marrying.

632
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:27,478
Marrying them is fine, but I've had
to clothe and feed her for years.

633
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:31,070
Sure you can have her.

634
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:36,233
What would you pay for her?
-What do you want?

635
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:46,194
The boy is asking for our daughter.
I promised her for a bottle.

636
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:50,313
What do you think, mother?
-Elina...

637
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:55,594
In a year's time, our girl will be
supporting a little arse on her arm.

638
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:04,918
The girl came to see
where to put her spinning-wheel.

639
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:08,874
We'll help you as long as
we are of any help.

640
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:13,278
I'm not afraid of you, but shared
households are just like that.

641
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:18,998
We'll build an old-folks cottage
for us so we can get along better.

642
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:47,834
Akseli!

643
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:12,949
You keep your mouth shut, goat!

644
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:27,716
According to the new law, contracts
will have to stay in force for now.

645
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:32,755
That's how Elina's parents' eviction
was cancelled.

646
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:39,758
Akseli is the eldest, but remember
your younger sons too.

647
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:42,792
Right, so it is.

648
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:47,756
But Akseli has been responsible
for the rent-work for years now.

649
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:53,750
I wouldn't turn back on him now.
-That's for Koskela to decide.

650
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:59,000
So we will draft the contract
in his name. -If you wish so.

651
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:02,716
Yes. Well, yes.

652
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:14,553
What's bothering you?
Has something happened?

653
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:20,158
Is it true that
you have been with Aune?

654
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:24,197
Who told you that?

655
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:29,469
Aune said she could have
had you if she had wanted.

656
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:33,669
Is it true?

657
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:45,828
Where did it happen? Tell me!

658
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:51,793
In the sauna at the Leppänen house.

659
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:56,755
What did you do with her?
Tell me everything.

660
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:04,195
I did screw her.
It doesn't get any better.

661
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,231
You too!

662
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:13,996
Take that to her.
Put it on that tart's finger.

663
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:16,429
Take it!
-Don't go.

664
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:20,030
If you leave, I'll kill myself!
-You won't do that.

665
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:23,797
I'll kill myself for sure!

666
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:27,630
We can't help that now.

667
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:34,915
Then let's not talk about it.

668
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:39,117
This marriage
pleases me to a great degree.

669
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:42,869
I have known you since
you were a little boy.

670
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:47,949
I wish all the best for you
as you enter manhood.

671
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:52,711
Bear in mind that marriage -

672
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:57,755
is not just an earthly union
taking place hear on Earth.

673
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:02,271
Your astral beings
have come together -

674
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:06,393
before either of you had
a conscious thought about it.

675
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:10,911
The People's Hall is the right place
for your wedding.

676
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:17,758
Socialism is, should I say,
a witness to your marriage.

677
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:20,269
Congratulations.

678
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:36,595
Did you see how the Pastor's wife
chattered when she congratulated us?

679
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:40,269
She can be so sugary
when it comes down to it.

680
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:45,235
You see, the gentry doesn't show
anything in their faces.

681
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:51,832
Educated people know
what to look like and when.

682
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:58,992
What do you say
if we build a proper kitchen?

683
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:03,519
The hall would be left
as a Sunday room.

684
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:06,029
Why not.

685
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:10,870
And then we'll panel up the walls.
-But only halfway.

686
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:15,516
I want real wallpaper
above the panel.

687
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:18,439
Sure, why not.

688
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:23,955
I baptise you, Vilho Johannes -

689
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:26,799
in the name of the Father -

690
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:29,436
the Son -

691
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:33,190
and the Holy Ghost. Amen.

692
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:47,952
WAR EXPANDING IN EUROPE

693
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:54,079
You can't take anything
for granted anymore.

694
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:59,033
At least we'd have
the burial plot booked.

695
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:02,038
I'm sorry,
but I cannot give you a discount.

696
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:06,438
It would be fair that a man who has
cleared over ten hectares of land -

697
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:09,677
would get the last yards for free.

698
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:13,590
But you won't need it
for many years to come.

699
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:17,554
You'll drive me to the churchyard,
like my predecessor.

700
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:23,550
I think that will not happen. I'm
starting to be in such a bad way.

701
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:33,719
Why did I have to be born
into such small circles?

702
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:37,992
People of my age elsewhere
are doing great things.

703
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:42,477
But after all,
war is against human nature.

704
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:46,756
War, if anything, <i>is</i>human nature.

705
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:09,113
Aino is doing the laundry.

706
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:12,598
My name is not Aino.

707
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:14,836
What is it then?

708
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,912
You should know, sir.

709
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:20,508
I do know. It's Aino.

710
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:23,234
No it isn't.

711
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:26,478
What's wrong with your finger?

712
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:30,955
I cut it with a sickle.

713
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:35,309
Let me blow on it.

714
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:38,238
You're a terrible man!

715
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:44,470
Don't, you wouldn't like me anyhow.

716
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:48,673
If Aino is nice,
I will surely like her.

717
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:54,955
Please believe me,
my name is not Aino.

718
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:03,952
Halme asked me to tell you
about the Tenants' Bill.

719
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:08,916
The tenants' rights have been left
untouched for another five years.

720
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:12,237
The bosses' secret wish
has been drained empty.

721
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:16,239
But I wouldn't applaud
the emperor yet.

722
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:21,349
You give thanks for presents,
not for justice.

723
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:48,678
Do you mind if I go by
the Laurila house? -Go right ahead.

724
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:54,392
It can't stop anyone walking on the
road. -Why don't we go together.

725
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:57,796
I'm not going anywhere
with Koskela's golden boy.

726
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:00,480
People might talk.

727
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:07,152
It's yours, you were with me
at the time. -So were many others.

728
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:11,273
You can't be sure it's mine.
-But it is.

729
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:14,710
I can bring five men
to court against you.

730
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:19,356
You'd be left with the expenses
and the shame. So keep quiet.

731
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:26,916
I'll ask you straight:
have you and Oskari been involved?

732
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:30,032
We have been involved.

733
01:13:30,160 --> 01:13:34,438
Then, before Almighty God,
has it been only him?

734
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:38,075
I don't mean to offend,
but we need the truth.

735
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:42,751
I didn't do it with others.
Oskari was my groom.

736
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:45,514
But there were others?

737
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:50,512
Sometimes, a little,
but mostly with Osku.

738
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:57,955
Oskari was one, all right.
There may have been others too.

739
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:03,473
But he certainly was one.
-Why blame Oskari alone then?

740
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:06,239
It's not my fault alone.

741
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:10,878
It's all good at the time.
But now everyone is denying it.

742
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,992
I asked the steward for permission -

743
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:20,349
to hoe the plotside
for a little more land.

744
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:24,838
So we'd have
them potatoes at least.

745
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:30,114
I'll help out as best as I can.
Although Oskari can't be blamed.

746
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:33,516
The baby is not guilty of anything,
that's for sure.

747
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:38,555
It is Osku's all right!
But I won't chase after one man.

748
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:43,436
This village would go upside down
if you knew about my men.

749
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:47,269
There are some
that I've left for others.

750
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:50,597
There are fine ladies
with men that I've had.

751
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:53,712
God told me
to come here and find out.

752
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:57,833
I don't care for a man who makes
his mother do his dirty business.

753
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:01,748
I could marry gentry too.
-Don't speak rubbish.

754
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:06,237
I'll help the best I can, although
Oskari cannot be blamed.

755
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:08,516
Good evening.

756
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:11,189
Good evening.

757
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:21,272
We'd have them potatoes at least.

758
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:43,154
You will need to
keep quiet about this.

759
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:46,949
I'll take a training course
for officers in Germany.

760
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:51,198
If you speak about this, you'll
endanger me and many others.

761
01:15:51,320 --> 01:15:54,039
No need to talk,
I've made up my mind.

762
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:58,517
Everything is planned for.
The less you ask the better.

763
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:01,632
What about afterwards?

764
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:07,358
I don't know yet.

765
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:29,310
Why is Halme coming here
in the middle of the day?

766
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:42,033
You're as beautiful as ever.

767
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:48,594
Dress up. You must come with me
to the People's Hall at once.

768
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:53,236
Nicholas ll is no longer
the Emperor of Russia -

769
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:56,193
and much less
the Grand Duke of Finland.

770
01:16:56,320 --> 01:17:01,155
Revolution has broken out
in St. Petersburg. -Hell no!

771
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:04,477
Do you think I came
all the way here to joke?

772
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:07,194
Hellberg called from Helsinki.

773
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:10,396
All right then.

774
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:15,196
No Savior from on high
than the people itself.

775
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:20,470
Make way for Koskela.

776
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:22,670
Come, Koskela.

777
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,958
Let's go up front, Akseli.

778
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:33,271
Go up to the front, Elina.
Go sit beside your husband.

779
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:39,269
A beautiful flower has risen
out of the mire of this trade war:

780
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:42,312
freedom for Finland's poor.

781
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:48,595
Comrades, the power of the spirit
rises above cannons and swords.

782
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:52,316
So how about the land-lease law?

783
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:57,353
We can't give a direct answer
right now.

784
01:17:57,480 --> 01:18:03,157
But I believe soon the lords
will have to give us all they can.

785
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:08,075
We'll put poles around our farms
and say: "Hand off, it's mine."

786
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:20,872
I think we should thank
master Halme somehow.

787
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:23,429
Some applause.

788
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:26,711
He's been so busy for us.
-I second that!

789
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:31,195
Shut up!
Our Preeti is being seconded.

790
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:34,071
Thank you.

791
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:39,479
However, cheering an individual
feels out of place -

792
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:44,469
when we're celebrating
the downfall of a dictatorship.

793
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:50,477
But it tells me your faith
in the cause has grown stronger.

794
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:02,833
I thought
maybe I could do this work as well.

795
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:05,474
A strike is fine -

796
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:09,036
but I don't understand
stopping others from working.

797
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:11,390
There is a shortage of foodstuffs.

798
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:15,439
The poorest workers are
the first to suffer from a strike.

799
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:19,917
People have been starved to death
in this country before.

800
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:27,277
But you're a farmer too, Akseli.

801
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:32,315
Farming would be different
if I had land of my own.

802
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:40,834
There's been trouble
in the manor's fields.

803
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:44,717
I have to go and sort it out.

804
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:47,991
Akseli can certainly go
if he has to.

805
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:04,390
Those in favour of the strike
have the majority.

806
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:09,719
Anyone opposed to the strike,
raise your hand.

807
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:13,953
So, we're demanding
an eight-hour workday -

808
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:17,390
and the Workers' Association's
Board of Directors -

809
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:22,719
will represent the proletariat.
All those in favour?

810
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:27,715
The motion is passed.

811
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:33,551
Let's get busy.
And what we begin, we also finish.

812
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:49,272
Nice May weather we're having.
It's nice to plant God's crops.

813
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:54,838
Did you want to see me about
something? -Not the Pastor.

814
01:20:54,960 --> 01:21:00,318
But your men haven't heard that all
places of work are on strike.

815
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:03,716
If they want to work,
leave them in peace.

816
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:08,431
The Pastor can work all he wants,
but the scabs will have to go.

817
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:12,553
Why is Kivivuori on strike?
You are your own employer.

818
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:17,356
You pay your dues for the
manor in cash. -Sort of, yes.

819
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:23,396
But I've shortened my working hours,
and I expect all bosses to join me.

820
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:28,872
The Koskela boys too.

821
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:32,754
Think about your good parents.
Shame on you.

822
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:35,474
We have nothing
to be ashamed about.

823
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:39,559
We haven't taken anyone's land away.

824
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:46,109
Them as well. I see.

825
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:31,715
Remember, no trouble.
Don't shame the working class.

826
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:37,915
But the scabs can go to Hell! -They
have brought in students to work.

827
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:42,915
The demonstration is fine, as long
as the workers are left unharmed.

828
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:47,159
It is a grave wrong
to use scab labour.

829
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:50,477
Who the hell threw a stone?

830
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:06,831
Akseli!

831
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:26,152
Jesus Christ,
they're shooting at us!

832
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:28,271
Akseli! Do something!

833
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:31,312
No stones and no guns!

834
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:39,439
I say this to every
troublemaker here:

835
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:44,998
if you want me to take part in the
negotiations, the fighting must end.

836
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:48,999
Are we supposed be nice while
we're being shot at and stoned?

837
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:53,318
Violence undermines our chances!

838
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:58,073
Both parties are committed
to ending the strike.

839
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:03,228
Right, but you get up at four every
morning and work until night.

840
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:07,797
You can't treat people
like animals forever, you know.

841
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:14,191
They're having a singing rehearsal.
Musical people.

842
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:17,109
They're shouting out
in their hunger.

843
01:24:17,240 --> 01:24:22,917
We have been threatened with
violence, lest the unrest cease.

844
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:27,511
We've had to work two weeks
with stones raining on us.

845
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:31,918
The rights of the working class
cannot be trodden on any longer.

846
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:34,952
Will you give them voluntarily -

847
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:38,675
or will they have
to take them by force?

848
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:44,511
That is the kind of talk that makes
the people go rowdy. It must end!

849
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:51,716
Believe me, violence will not
bring about a solution.

850
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:57,919
The ghosts of our past
are demanding justice.

851
01:24:59,240 --> 01:25:04,030
Let us give it to them,
for ghosts don't die from shooting.

852
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:07,397
Nobody has said
anything about shooting.

853
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:11,269
This is not going anywhere.

854
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:14,756
Our side, let's meet
in the council room.

855
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:19,352
Halme can surely speak.

856
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:25,868
He should have been
a school teacher...

857
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:41,473
I think Yllö took them back there
to soften them up.

858
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:45,194
Anything we get-

859
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:50,075
is thanks to that screaming
bunch of rag-tags out there.

860
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:01,359
The Koskela baby
is eating a sweetbread.

861
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:05,917
I could buy one too if I wanted.
-Go right ahead.

862
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:09,112
I'm not as indulgent
as the Koskela baby.

863
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:20,435
We have decided to
satisfy your demands.

864
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:24,594
We did so only to secure the peace.

865
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:29,919
The workers' leaders seem to be
unable to control their own people.

866
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:33,516
Let's start drafting an agreement.

867
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:37,708
I have it here. Just sign it.

868
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:43,029
You were mighty sure
of your victory, Kivivuori.

869
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:46,994
I have always believed
that justice will prevail.

870
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:54,952
Dear comrades.

871
01:26:55,080 --> 01:27:00,757
I'm sorry if my voice breaks down
when I say these words:

872
01:27:01,160 --> 01:27:05,756
Long live free
and democratic Finland!

873
01:27:06,440 --> 01:27:10,274
The masters agreed to the terms.

874
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:24,509
Soon the land-measurer will come
and divide the fields anew.

875
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:28,679
Right after the parliament
has made the decision.

876
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:32,797
Then I have work for you boys too.

877
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:38,194
I'll make a new cowshed and
put a siding on the main building.

878
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:41,596
How will you buy rye?

879
01:27:41,720 --> 01:27:45,395
I'll show you how to buy rye.

880
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:53,275
Dear comrades.

881
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:59,714
I must inform you that
we have been betrayed once again.

882
01:28:21,080 --> 01:28:26,074
Why are you making all that noise?
-Should I sneak around in my socks?

883
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:32,758
What is it?
-They've broken up the parliament.

884
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:35,519
They arranged this
with the Russians.

885
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:39,394
Those bourgeoisie senators
and the Governor General!

886
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:43,877
Right after the Left
took the majority in the parliament.

887
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:47,356
But isn't there a new election?
-Of course.

888
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:52,156
But do you think they'd ever
let us take the majority again?

889
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:56,393
I wish I could come face to face
with the likes of them.

890
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:07,115
Goddammit!

891
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:11,036
We're setting up
a protective organisation.

892
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:14,994
We're gathering money to buy arms.

893
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:19,554
Perhaps that's the only way.

894
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:23,434
The Russians have stopped
obeying their officers.

895
01:29:23,560 --> 01:29:29,556
We must get rid of them.
And I'm done shooting in the air.

896
01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:35,152
I don't have a lot right now.
I can maybe give more later.

897
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:45,839
Ninety-two.
Unless there are changes.

898
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:52,916
The election was false. The old
legal parliament has to regroup.

899
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:56,874
This one has been chosen
by the people. It is legal.

900
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:01,551
Fake votes. That's the only way
the Right would get the majority.

901
01:30:01,680 --> 01:30:05,719
That's how the people voted.
I don't know much about politics -

902
01:30:05,840 --> 01:30:10,356
but the people are in charge, right?
-And they will be.

903
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:16,629
The bosses have taken a bad road,
and there will be grief at its end.

904
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:23,239
If you refuse to accept the people's
decision, you are free to revolt.

905
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:27,400
The country
is practically independent now.

906
01:30:27,400 --> 01:30:31,393
The country
is practically independent now.

907
01:30:31,880 --> 01:30:37,910
The security guard's main task
is to defend the working class -

908
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:41,476
from attacks
by non-socialist guards.

909
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:47,197
I don't think it's a good idea.
It will lead to war, we know that.

910
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:53,197
I suggest organising independent,
unarmed security forces.

911
01:30:53,320 --> 01:30:57,074
I propose that this suggestion
be turned down.

912
01:30:57,560 --> 01:31:00,358
I second that. Permission to speak?

913
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:04,951
The guard is voluntary.
Kivivuori doesn't have to join.

914
01:31:05,080 --> 01:31:09,790
I won't join. I'm not a warmonger.
-Am I a warmonger?

915
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:12,434
Sure feels like it.

916
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:22,596
Only intellectual acts
are constructive.

917
01:31:22,720 --> 01:31:26,508
Power in the hands
of the working class -

918
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:29,791
if it emerges as violence -

919
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:33,435
is no better than
bourgeoisie violence.

920
01:31:33,560 --> 01:31:36,916
That's eloquent,
but doesn't help the workers.

921
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:42,319
I believe that the working class
will eliminate arms from the world -

922
01:31:42,440 --> 01:31:45,398
and cannot allow them
to pick them up.

923
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:47,988
I resign from armament -

924
01:31:48,120 --> 01:31:52,955
and trust that the cause
is stronger than its shadow.

925
01:31:53,080 --> 01:31:58,154
Kivivuori and Halme
are scaring us with war.

926
01:31:58,280 --> 01:32:01,670
Setting up a guard
doesn't mean war -

927
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:05,839
unless the non-socialists
resort to violence.

928
01:32:06,680 --> 01:32:10,559
Non-socialists don't have
the exclusive right to carry arms.

929
01:32:10,680 --> 01:32:13,035
I second Hellberg's proposition.

930
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:17,637
The worker gets nothing
unless he has power.

931
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:23,115
I want the minutes to state that I
refuse to participate in the guard.

932
01:32:23,240 --> 01:32:28,917
I'll leave it to the hotheads who
think they can control their army.

933
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:35,838
How are you, Lieutenant Koskela?
-I don't see the humour in this.

934
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:42,231
You won't be joining
any of those killing guards!

935
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:46,353
People have turned into wolves.
-I'm not killing anybody.

936
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:50,519
Thank God I bought
those burial plots in time.

937
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:57,192
To bring a child into this world,
not knowing what will happen.

938
01:32:57,320 --> 01:33:00,790
We'll see if he is born
onto a proper farm.

939
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:05,358
We must forget past conflicts.

940
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:09,792
The argument was over the means,
not over the goals.

941
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:15,950
Our country is now free, but
it is still threatened by anarchy.

942
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:20,388
We've declared our country
independent and untouchable -

943
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:24,354
but at the same time,
wild forces are invading our homes.

944
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:29,918
Law-abiding Finns must be allowed
to defend their homes.

945
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:49,510
Is father inside?
-Yes. Did you get them?

946
01:33:49,720 --> 01:33:51,790
Yes.
-Show us.

947
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:55,913
Don't start waving them around.
-Let's just take a look.

948
01:34:01,320 --> 01:34:04,198
Looking good!

949
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:09,389
When you hit someone with one of
these, it's over. -Let's hide them.

950
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:14,116
Have you got bullets too? -About
40. We can practice tomorrow.

951
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:20,790
Töyry's boys have shotguns.

952
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:24,993
These take more in the magazine
than a shotgun.

953
01:34:56,120 --> 01:34:59,157
Who is it?
-Messenger from the headquarters.

954
01:35:00,640 --> 01:35:02,471
Come in.

955
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:06,513
I have an order. It starts now.

956
01:35:06,840 --> 01:35:11,038
What's going on in the main village?
-They just started to gather up.

957
01:35:11,160 --> 01:35:15,472
Are the butchers on the move?
-They say some left yesterday.

958
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:20,078
If things go wrong at the church,
I want to know immediately.

959
01:35:20,200 --> 01:35:24,796
Otherwise we're in a world
of trouble. Be careful.

960
01:35:27,720 --> 01:35:30,837
<i>For the leader of the second platoon</i>
<i>A. Koskela.</i>

961
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:33,872
<i>The platoon is to</i>
<i>undertake its mission.</i>

962
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:39,438
<i>Resistance must be crushed swiftly.</i>
<i>Mobilise all men without delay.</i>

963
01:35:39,720 --> 01:35:43,030
<i>In the name of the working class.</i>
<i>K.A. Ylöstalo</i>

964
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:46,391
<i>After reading, burn message.</i>

965
01:35:47,400 --> 01:35:50,392
What was it?
-Just a messenger.

966
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:53,637
We've been told to assemble
at the Workers' Hall.

967
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:58,276
Just go to sleep.
-I haven't slept a wink in a week.

968
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:01,392
There's no need to cry about this.

969
01:36:02,040 --> 01:36:06,318
Shall I fix you something to eat?
-Why not.

970
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:09,239
I'll go wake Aku and Aleksi.

971
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:15,718
Don't do anything bad to people.
For the children's sake.

972
01:36:23,320 --> 01:36:28,155
I don't need to speak long.
You all know your tasks.

973
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:32,717
I have word from the headquarters
that the revolution has begun.

974
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:39,029
There is no time for speeches.
We must do our part.

975
01:36:39,160 --> 01:36:43,278
I'll go out and confiscate arms
with my team.

976
01:36:43,400 --> 01:36:46,551
Road patrol duties
will be set up later.

977
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:51,674
When you meet people,
don't overreact. But be firm!

978
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:55,992
Where are your boys?

979
01:36:56,120 --> 01:37:00,591
I never would have believed
I'd see you on affairs like this.

980
01:37:02,440 --> 01:37:05,955
Let them go, this doesn't
depend on three men.

981
01:37:06,080 --> 01:37:09,755
Did they take your guns?
-Yes, the few that we have.

982
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:13,117
We aren't used to
running around with guns.

983
01:37:13,240 --> 01:37:16,437
The working class
has seized power in Finland.

984
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:20,792
From now on you will follow
the proletariat's orders.

985
01:37:24,120 --> 01:37:27,635
By what authority, if I may ask?

986
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:32,151
The same authority
that you used to have!

987
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:38,913
I will obey a legal government only,
and Koskela will too, eventually.

988
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:44,160
You meant to kill the workers
quickly, but your guards failed you.

989
01:37:44,280 --> 01:37:49,229
Do you believe those blatant lies?
I pity you.

990
01:37:49,360 --> 01:37:52,591
Your no-good leaders
have betrayed you.

991
01:37:52,720 --> 01:37:55,792
You are the last
to speak about betrayal.

992
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:59,037
Your have betrayed people
all your life!

993
01:37:59,160 --> 01:38:03,790
You've never kept your word.
Not even a written one.

994
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:07,913
You should be ashamed,
if you know how to be ashamed!

995
01:38:08,040 --> 01:38:10,508
But your days of
living off us are over.

996
01:38:10,640 --> 01:38:15,350
If you think I can be scared
by brawling, you are mistaken.

997
01:38:16,440 --> 01:38:19,671
Rule of that sort will fail.

998
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:22,872
And when it does, we must be firm.

999
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:51,793
Why you men come here?
You have homes.

1000
01:38:51,920 --> 01:38:55,959
We're looking for the manor's arms.
We must inspect all rooms.

1001
01:38:56,080 --> 01:38:58,116
You don't find?

1002
01:38:58,240 --> 01:39:02,631
You should obey the
proletariat's orders from now on.

1003
01:39:02,760 --> 01:39:05,877
We are not giving them for fun.

1004
01:39:12,560 --> 01:39:14,994
Why don't you come with us.

1005
01:39:15,120 --> 01:39:20,035
We must organise a headquarters,
and Otto is staying away.

1006
01:39:21,680 --> 01:39:24,638
You could help us with the new laws.

1007
01:39:24,760 --> 01:39:29,629
Thanks you, but I'll settle
with my meagre dwelling.

1008
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:39,148
We haven't spilled any blood, so you
should have no qualms about it.

1009
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:42,477
I cannot take part in this.

1010
01:39:42,600 --> 01:39:47,754
Violence is obnoxious to me
in all its forms.

1011
01:39:53,480 --> 01:39:56,631
Looks like they succeeded.

1012
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:07,874
She put a lot of lard in Aku's cup.
Smart girl.

1013
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:12,915
You go to hell.
And what are you smirking about?

1014
01:40:13,080 --> 01:40:18,837
You should be wrapped in blankets
and made all over again.

1015
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:24,752
Well maybe just a taste,
though I just ate at home.

1016
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:27,599
But just a taste.

1017
01:40:29,800 --> 01:40:36,478
He'll give me land or money.
He has made me suffer so.

1018
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:39,878
Maybe just a taste...

1019
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,798
I could well put a bullet in him.

1020
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:47,431
Your case will be handled.
Don't try to jump the queue.

1021
01:40:47,560 --> 01:40:51,235
But how will that bastard make up
for my time in prison?

1022
01:40:51,400 --> 01:40:56,428
We can't help that anymore.
But don't take your own action.

1023
01:40:56,560 --> 01:40:58,869
Don't touch the people!

1024
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:02,274
Where are you going?
-Laurila.

1025
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:06,473
Do you want to see Anttoo? -No,
but they have a nice daughter there.

1026
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:09,160
Stay on your own side.

1027
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:12,795
Don't go, let's talk about things.

1028
01:41:16,440 --> 01:41:21,036
Don't hit me, goddammit!
What have I ever done to you?

1029
01:41:21,160 --> 01:41:24,789
You grew up in the parsonage woods.
Acting almighty.

1030
01:41:24,920 --> 01:41:29,516
I don't like you people at all!
-What are you barking about?

1031
01:41:29,680 --> 01:41:33,514
I won't push myself on any woman.

1032
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:38,430
Goodbye and farewell.
-Go on!

1033
01:41:56,720 --> 01:41:58,950
Password?

1034
01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:06,758
Come out with your hands up...
or I'll shoot.

1035
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:16,792
Sorry, could you tell us if
this is the road to Vammala.

1036
01:42:17,400 --> 01:42:20,073
No, it's not the road to Vammala.

1037
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:24,239
Then we're lost.
A Red Guard road patrol told us...

1038
01:42:24,360 --> 01:42:27,113
Have you got a pass?

1039
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:32,669
Go that way.
That's my orders.

1040
01:42:39,120 --> 01:42:43,750
You're on the move without a pass.
I will have to take you in.

1041
01:42:43,880 --> 01:42:47,998
Akusti and Elias, go to headquarters
with these boys.

1042
01:42:51,280 --> 01:42:56,274
Why are you walking them around?
We should have shot them.

1043
01:42:56,400 --> 01:43:00,473
We won't be shooting anyone
without an investigation.

1044
01:43:00,720 --> 01:43:04,508
They can be telling the truth,
for all we know.

1045
01:43:04,680 --> 01:43:08,070
Plenty of people on the move.

1046
01:43:16,240 --> 01:43:18,834
Playing cards, are we?

1047
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:25,718
Some poker, but the bets are small.
-We don't have that much.

1048
01:43:28,160 --> 01:43:31,311
Please bear in mind -

1049
01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:36,275
that the building belongs to the
Association, not the Red Guard.

1050
01:43:37,800 --> 01:43:41,554
I expect the lodgers
to keep the floor tidy.

1051
01:43:41,680 --> 01:43:46,549
We're sweeping the gentry out of
this land, not sweeping floors.

1052
01:43:48,440 --> 01:43:50,715
Who said that?

1053
01:43:50,840 --> 01:43:52,831
Elias.

1054
01:43:55,360 --> 01:43:58,158
Take a broom and sweep the floor.

1055
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:07,509
If anyone talks back to him one more
time, he's going to answer to me!

1056
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:16,918
I came to ask
if I could use the telephone.

1057
01:44:17,120 --> 01:44:20,874
It's your telephone, go right ahead.

1058
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,639
We could use you here, you know.

1059
01:44:24,760 --> 01:44:30,517
I might help you in some matters
of a civilian nature.

1060
01:44:34,760 --> 01:44:38,196
You need a pass. You can get one
at the people's hall.

1061
01:44:38,320 --> 01:44:41,278
How can Aleksi Koskela
be a part of this?

1062
01:44:41,400 --> 01:44:45,712
I have my orders.
Maybe I'll run and get one for you.

1063
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:49,515
Or if you would...
-Don't you have any manners?

1064
01:44:49,640 --> 01:44:53,519
He's doing important guard work
and doesn't have time -

1065
01:44:53,640 --> 01:44:58,760
to listen to uncivilised people
giving him abuse.

1066
01:45:01,280 --> 01:45:04,477
I will not accept
an illegal travel pass.

1067
01:45:04,600 --> 01:45:07,876
Write away,
she can take it or leave it.

1068
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:12,835
Taking that paper would mean
acknowledging your authority.

1069
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:15,394
My conscience doesn't permit it.

1070
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:21,550
Your conscience has permitted
many things. I don't value it much.

1071
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:25,993
Let's make her wash pans
with the girls.

1072
01:45:26,600 --> 01:45:28,795
I'll wash latrines if I have to!

1073
01:45:28,920 --> 01:45:33,914
No task is too menial to ensure
the rights of the Finnish people.

1074
01:45:34,040 --> 01:45:38,192
I offered you a pass, but if you
don't want one, you can stay home.

1075
01:45:38,320 --> 01:45:41,278
You have never washed
your own latrine -

1076
01:45:41,400 --> 01:45:45,154
so stop bragging.
Spare us your speeches!

1077
01:45:45,280 --> 01:45:49,432
Lauri, escort the lady
back to the parsonage!

1078
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:04,000
I've decided to stay home
and help Anna with the housekeeping.

1079
01:46:04,200 --> 01:46:08,591
Just you go in and have coffee.
You could get killed.

1080
01:46:08,720 --> 01:46:14,511
Well, that is the last reason
that would keep me away.

1081
01:46:14,640 --> 01:46:20,272
That's reason enough for me.
I don't intend to be hanged.

1082
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:23,278
I gave up my position
in the Association too.

1083
01:46:23,400 --> 01:46:28,030
I don't want to discuss things that
are decided with mob justice.

1084
01:46:28,160 --> 01:46:32,870
I have marched together with
the proletariat for a long time.

1085
01:46:33,160 --> 01:46:39,076
I cannot turn back on them now,
even if I disagree on some issues.

1086
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:10,469
Let's return to the Workers' Hall
for an equipment check.

1087
01:47:29,240 --> 01:47:32,550
Those two men you sent
to the church village.

1088
01:47:32,680 --> 01:47:36,389
What did you write on the paper
you gave them?

1089
01:47:36,520 --> 01:47:40,115
How and where they were caught,
nothing else.

1090
01:47:41,240 --> 01:47:44,550
They have been killed.

1091
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:49,231
Don't blame it on me.

1092
01:47:51,040 --> 01:47:54,828
That paper is at the headquarters.
My conscience is clear.

1093
01:47:54,960 --> 01:47:57,713
This makes it
difficult for me to return...

1094
01:47:57,840 --> 01:48:01,992
I wrote they'd been apprehended
hiding beside the road -

1095
01:48:02,120 --> 01:48:05,635
that they had avoided patrols
and had no papers.

1096
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:10,470
They were not dangerous men.
-Blame those who shot them.

1097
01:48:16,480 --> 01:48:19,836
Pentinkulma headquarters,
Koskela speaking.

1098
01:48:22,200 --> 01:48:24,191
I see.

1099
01:48:25,360 --> 01:48:29,956
Valenti, come take this down,
there's a message.

1100
01:48:34,200 --> 01:48:36,191
Yes?

1101
01:48:40,920 --> 01:48:43,992
We're going to the front.

1102
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:53,628
We can expect
a lot of running and crying.

1103
01:48:59,920 --> 01:49:04,072
I wrote my goodbyes, as you're not
speaking to me any longer.

1104
01:49:04,200 --> 01:49:07,397
You don't need to reply.

1105
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:14,996
<i>You can go to the front, and I</i>
<i>won't cry if the butchers kill you.</i>

1106
01:49:15,120 --> 01:49:20,114
<i>You never say a nice word.</i>
<i>Always shooting off your mouth.</i>

1107
01:49:20,240 --> 01:49:23,789
<i>I'll be fetching suet</i>
<i>from Pentti house tonight.</i>

1108
01:49:23,920 --> 01:49:27,629
<i>But I will not see you off,</i>
<i>so don't expect it.</i>

1109
01:49:27,880 --> 01:49:31,919
Is this your new guarding post,
or why are you standing there?

1110
01:49:32,040 --> 01:49:34,474
You wrote that you'd be here.

1111
01:49:34,600 --> 01:49:37,990
Did you think...
Jesus, what are you thinking?

1112
01:49:38,120 --> 01:49:40,714
Don't play games.
Why did you write then?

1113
01:49:40,840 --> 01:49:43,832
I just wanted to say goodbye.

1114
01:49:43,960 --> 01:49:46,474
Now give me a kiss for my trouble.

1115
01:49:48,240 --> 01:49:52,916
Don't spit at me.
You deserve a spanking!

1116
01:49:54,520 --> 01:50:00,197
Don't think you can play me
for a fool. That's a mistake.

1117
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,355
If just for once.

1118
01:50:04,520 --> 01:50:07,956
Even once. But always.

1119
01:50:11,480 --> 01:50:15,758
I don't know what I should do.
-You know.

1120
01:50:15,880 --> 01:50:18,952
Just a kind word once in a while.

1121
01:50:38,480 --> 01:50:43,076
Don't go to the front. Run away.
Let's leave together.

1122
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:47,193
They don't ask questions now.
-I have to go.

1123
01:50:48,160 --> 01:50:52,199
Will you come back to me?
No matter what?

1124
01:50:52,600 --> 01:50:55,353
Of course I will.

1125
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:59,437
You can do
whatever you want with me.

1126
01:51:11,120 --> 01:51:14,749
Don't worry.
I'll write to you soon.

1127
01:51:25,400 --> 01:51:30,269
Father says that we're going to
get more land from Töyry.

1128
01:51:31,200 --> 01:51:34,397
Mother promised me new clothes -

1129
01:51:34,520 --> 01:51:39,196
when the proletariat is in power,
and the poor are allowed to buy.

1130
01:51:41,560 --> 01:51:46,156
I know that Akseli doesn't like me,
or any of you at Koskela.

1131
01:51:46,280 --> 01:51:50,114
Don't say that. That's in your mind.

1132
01:51:50,360 --> 01:51:54,956
You don't care for me.
-What's the matter again?

1133
01:51:55,080 --> 01:51:58,197
You sound so dull when you say it.

1134
01:51:58,320 --> 01:52:01,676
How cheerful should I sound?

1135
01:52:05,480 --> 01:52:07,710
Swear it.

1136
01:52:07,840 --> 01:52:11,389
Let's put our hands together
like two horse dealers.

1137
01:52:12,360 --> 01:52:17,195
Don't laugh. You mustn't laugh
when you're taking an oath.

1138
01:52:17,320 --> 01:52:22,599
Say: "I like you."
-I like you.

1139
01:52:22,720 --> 01:52:26,395
"When I come back from the front,
I'm going to marry you."

1140
01:52:26,520 --> 01:52:30,069
When I come back from the front,
I'm going to marry you.

1141
01:52:41,480 --> 01:52:45,234
Let's be very dear to each other.

1142
01:52:50,360 --> 01:52:53,989
Eat out of the bark box first.
It's older.

1143
01:52:54,120 --> 01:52:59,194
What have they done to the world?
-Both sides are to blame.

1144
01:52:59,320 --> 01:53:02,949
Shall we wear our neckties?
-Why would we do that?

1145
01:53:03,080 --> 01:53:07,915
We're going to Tampere, right?
-We're not going there to have fun.

1146
01:53:08,040 --> 01:53:10,315
Don't be so happy.

1147
01:53:10,440 --> 01:53:13,512
You're putting your heads
into the wolf's mouth.

1148
01:53:13,640 --> 01:53:17,872
This is the final battle. After
this, all weapons will be destroyed.

1149
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:23,836
Don't joke about it. Who knows
whose final battle this is.

1150
01:53:27,960 --> 01:53:30,918
Come say goodbye to father, boys.

1151
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:39,120
Be good little boys while I'm away.

1152
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:49,399
Men don't miss anyone.
-Right.

1153
01:54:11,520 --> 01:54:14,876
Mother's crying in the bedroom.

1154
01:54:32,920 --> 01:54:37,789
There's no conductor
to check our tickets this time.

1155
01:54:38,520 --> 01:54:44,470
This is our very own train.
We can stop wherever we want.

1156
01:54:44,640 --> 01:54:49,668
If we had bullets, we'd shoot
every time we pass a station.

1157
01:54:50,760 --> 01:54:54,639
Mark my words, we won't go
any further than Tampere.

1158
01:54:54,760 --> 01:54:59,436
The newspaper said that Mannerheim
has gone to an unknown place -

1159
01:54:59,560 --> 01:55:04,076
to assemble a new army,
after his old one ran away.

1160
01:55:11,760 --> 01:55:16,834
<i>I shed tears all night, thinking</i>
<i>that destiny will tear us apart.</i>

1161
01:55:16,960 --> 01:55:20,999
<i>I hope we'll see each other again,</i>
<i>though I fear otherwise.</i>

1162
01:55:21,120 --> 01:55:26,069
<i>Don't go to the veryfront, stay in</i>
<i>the back. No matter how they ask.</i>

1163
01:55:26,200 --> 01:55:30,079
<i>Think only of your faithful friend</i>
<i>waiting for you back home.</i>

1164
01:55:30,200 --> 01:55:35,069
<i>We'll get some land somewhere, and</i>
<i>a small cottage where we can live.</i>

1165
01:55:35,200 --> 01:55:39,716
<i>If the parsonage lands are split up,</i>
<i>you'll probably get some of theirs.</i>

1166
01:55:39,840 --> 01:55:42,957
<i>I'll learn to sow and cook and all.</i>

1167
01:55:43,080 --> 01:55:48,837
<i>Every evening after work</i>
<i>I go home and think about you.</i>

1168
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:52,555
<i>When you return,</i>
<i>you can keep me for a long time -</i>

1169
01:55:52,680 --> 01:55:56,275
<i>and do what you wish with me.</i>

1170
01:55:56,760 --> 01:55:59,832
<i>With love, your special friend.</i>

1171
01:56:02,720 --> 01:56:03,880
My country-dwelling comrades,
tenant farmers and farmhands!

1172
01:56:03,880 --> 01:56:08,192
My country-dwelling comrades,
tenant farmers and farmhands!

1173
01:56:09,280 --> 01:56:13,193
With the authority vested in me by
the northern front -

1174
01:56:13,320 --> 01:56:16,437
I bid you welcome to Tampere.

1175
01:56:16,760 --> 01:56:21,629
You will join forces with
your factory worker comrades -

1176
01:56:21,760 --> 01:56:24,991
in the common fight-

1177
01:56:25,120 --> 01:56:30,194
against the butchering horde
of oppressors and enslavers!

1178
01:56:30,320 --> 01:56:34,313
When the noble Red Guard marches -

1179
01:56:34,440 --> 01:56:40,072
the poor rejoice and the
butchers' hearts tremble with fear!

1180
01:56:54,720 --> 01:56:58,759
In Varkaus, the butchers took one in
ten of our men from the line -

1181
01:56:58,880 --> 01:57:02,190
and shot them right there,
civilian or not.

1182
01:57:02,320 --> 01:57:05,118
Ylöstalo,
come over for negotiations.

1183
01:57:05,240 --> 01:57:09,279
When are we going to get
the clothes? -What clothes?

1184
01:57:09,400 --> 01:57:12,949
They promised that we'd get
clothes for the poorer folk.

1185
01:57:13,080 --> 01:57:15,913
We haven't promised you anything.

1186
01:57:17,120 --> 01:57:19,395
Come with me, Akseli.

1187
01:57:31,080 --> 01:57:33,833
Silent boys, these two.

1188
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:39,472
It's best not to lose this fight.

1189
01:57:41,440 --> 01:57:45,194
It's easier to have
just one way to go.

1190
01:57:45,320 --> 01:57:50,235
Not a step back,
that is the way to the grave.

1191
01:57:52,080 --> 01:57:54,196
What is it?

1192
01:57:54,680 --> 01:57:56,830
Butchers!

1193
01:57:58,360 --> 01:58:00,271
Osku.

1194
01:58:00,560 --> 01:58:03,996
What is it?
-We must push on.

1195
01:58:04,120 --> 01:58:05,917
Charge!

1196
01:58:11,120 --> 01:58:13,509
Charge!

1197
01:58:17,720 --> 01:58:19,790
What is it? Go on!

1198
01:58:19,920 --> 01:58:23,754
Go on yourself, dammit!

1199
01:58:24,560 --> 01:58:27,028
Goddammit!

1200
01:58:34,680 --> 01:58:37,148
Charge!

1201
01:58:56,200 --> 01:58:59,795
Don't gather on the road.

1202
01:59:00,040 --> 01:59:03,316
Osku, secure your front,
and let's move.

1203
01:59:03,440 --> 01:59:07,433
They have machine guns. Come on!
-Osku!

1204
01:59:07,560 --> 01:59:10,950
Do you think I can help it?

1205
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:16,195
Remember, the order
to charge concerns everybody!

1206
01:59:16,320 --> 01:59:19,392
I did charge.
-And me.

1207
01:59:21,680 --> 01:59:25,878
All of Ostrobothnia, Savo and
Karelia are in White hands.

1208
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,673
I must admit I was losing hope.

1209
01:59:28,800 --> 01:59:33,510
The Whites are approaching Tampere
as fast as an automobile goes.

1210
01:59:34,720 --> 01:59:39,510
This is some piece of news. Indeed.

1211
01:59:39,640 --> 01:59:42,757
How could I doubt? How could I?

1212
01:59:50,640 --> 01:59:53,359
It's hell up ahead, boys.

1213
01:59:54,520 --> 01:59:56,636
Charge!

1214
01:59:58,040 --> 02:00:01,032
It looks easy enough on a map.

1215
02:00:11,240 --> 02:00:13,196
Goddammit!

1216
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,070
Boys, help me!

1217
02:00:17,200 --> 02:00:20,749
Someone save Arvi!
-You do it!

1218
02:00:22,720 --> 02:00:25,359
Where are you? Help!

1219
02:00:35,920 --> 02:00:38,150
Where are you hit?

1220
02:00:40,720 --> 02:00:42,631
No good.

1221
02:00:42,760 --> 02:00:46,036
Line up!
They're flanking us.

1222
02:00:48,320 --> 02:00:50,595
Keep the positions, men.

1223
02:00:50,720 --> 02:00:54,759
Keep cool, boys!
-Don't fall back!

1224
02:00:55,400 --> 02:00:58,153
Line up, soldiers of the revolution!

1225
02:01:00,800 --> 02:01:04,759
I have always enjoyed
my visits here -

1226
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:09,437
but this time
I'd rather have stayed away.

1227
02:01:09,720 --> 02:01:12,029
I come with awful news.

1228
02:01:12,160 --> 02:01:17,473
Your son is among
the company's deceased.

1229
02:01:19,160 --> 02:01:25,269
I see.. I see. That too.

1230
02:01:26,120 --> 02:01:30,352
They put one in the poor house
and one in prison.

1231
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:35,237
Someone should
send them to their God.

1232
02:01:41,640 --> 02:01:46,555
He's no master after all.
-The butcher is having a big sleep.

1233
02:01:47,560 --> 02:01:52,156
Ostrobothnian farmers have forced
their farmhands to the front.

1234
02:01:52,320 --> 02:01:55,232
The bosses never
fight their own wars.

1235
02:01:55,360 --> 02:01:58,636
I hear there's heavy fighting
in Vilppula.

1236
02:01:58,760 --> 02:02:01,194
Maybe they'll push through there.

1237
02:02:01,320 --> 02:02:05,757
Nobody is going to push through
if they trust that the others will.

1238
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,434
So what are we going to do?

1239
02:02:10,400 --> 02:02:12,994
I don't know.

1240
02:02:13,120 --> 02:02:16,396
Ylöstalo has sent out an orderly
for instructions.

1241
02:02:16,520 --> 02:02:19,751
If we're staying here,
we're in for a hell of a night.

1242
02:02:19,880 --> 02:02:25,034
Our clothes are wet and it's
damn cold. Go ask him what's up.

1243
02:02:32,120 --> 02:02:34,953
It's gone wrong all the way.

1244
02:02:35,080 --> 02:02:39,995
They've taken one village somewhere,
but nothing else.

1245
02:02:40,120 --> 02:02:44,159
We've been told
to hold these positions for now.

1246
02:02:45,240 --> 02:02:50,030
If we're spending the night here,
we need warm food. -Right.

1247
02:02:51,600 --> 02:02:54,797
Why don't you get us some.

1248
02:02:54,920 --> 02:02:57,150
Damn it.

1249
02:03:08,800 --> 02:03:14,318
We all must participate in the work.
Also the manor. -I need no advice.

1250
02:03:14,440 --> 02:03:18,911
I taught new farming methods,
I brought new cows!

1251
02:03:19,040 --> 02:03:22,032
I don't need your advice,
I don't start with you.

1252
02:03:22,160 --> 02:03:28,395
I recommend you sign this agreement.
-Leave! I sign no paper.

1253
02:03:31,640 --> 02:03:38,239
I'll send some men over there
from regional intelligence.

1254
02:03:38,640 --> 02:03:45,034
Are these men up to their task?
-They're good boys, all right.

1255
02:03:45,160 --> 02:03:48,755
I don't want to see
any kind of blackmail happening.

1256
02:03:48,880 --> 02:03:53,192
If the man doesn't sign
the agreement, he'll be arrested.

1257
02:03:55,000 --> 02:04:00,438
We hear you've made some hiding
places. We'd like to see them.

1258
02:04:02,080 --> 02:04:06,437
You go ahead, look.
-Let's talk a little first.

1259
02:04:07,480 --> 02:04:12,270
Stand up, this is an interrogation!

1260
02:04:13,200 --> 02:04:20,117
When the gendarmes interrogated me,
I had to stand for three hours!

1261
02:04:20,680 --> 02:04:26,357
Where are the manor's arms?
-I gave them away.

1262
02:04:26,480 --> 02:04:30,837
So you've armed a
counterrevolutionary organisation.

1263
02:04:32,920 --> 02:04:35,229
That's a serious crime.

1264
02:04:35,360 --> 02:04:41,595
You'll sign an agreement where
you'll refrain from such action.

1265
02:04:41,800 --> 02:04:45,713
This is your pledge of allegiance
to the people's delegation.

1266
02:04:45,840 --> 02:04:49,628
I can give no pledge.
-Sign the paper.

1267
02:04:53,480 --> 02:04:57,314
I can not.
-Sign it, you damn bloodsucker!

1268
02:04:57,800 --> 02:05:03,432
Please, leave old people alone.
Have mercy.

1269
02:05:03,560 --> 02:05:05,835
Please leave, madam.

1270
02:05:05,960 --> 02:05:08,838
Sign their paper, please.

1271
02:05:08,960 --> 02:05:11,838
<i>I can not. Don't ask it of me.</i>

1272
02:05:12,720 --> 02:05:16,110
Sir, you're under arrest.

1273
02:05:16,280 --> 02:05:20,319
Get dressed,
you're coming with us.

1274
02:05:35,160 --> 02:05:37,913
Let's stretch our legs.

1275
02:05:57,760 --> 02:06:03,118
Throw the body in the ditch.
The ice is partially melted.

1276
02:06:03,320 --> 02:06:05,709
It'll sink all right.

1277
02:06:17,240 --> 02:06:18,280
Your interrogators
have murdered the baron.

1278
02:06:18,280 --> 02:06:21,078
Your interrogators
have murdered the baron.

1279
02:06:21,200 --> 02:06:24,636
Answer me truthfully:
was this your intention?

1280
02:06:24,760 --> 02:06:30,710
You worry more about the
gentry's safety than the revolution.

1281
02:06:30,840 --> 02:06:35,231
Killing an old, harmless man
is not my idea of revolution.

1282
02:06:37,280 --> 02:06:42,832
Listen, Aatu.
I never ordered any killing.

1283
02:06:43,520 --> 02:06:46,432
We're fighting for survival here.

1284
02:06:46,560 --> 02:06:50,269
Attacks have been
thwarted on all fronts.

1285
02:06:50,440 --> 02:06:54,115
However much you come down
on the baron's murderers -

1286
02:06:54,240 --> 02:06:56,959
you won't be spared if we lose.

1287
02:06:57,080 --> 02:07:02,677
Those to be killed have been named,
and you are one of them.

1288
02:07:02,800 --> 02:07:09,273
I am too, and so are
Ylöstalo, Silander, and Koskela.

1289
02:07:20,880 --> 02:07:25,670
Come on now.
I can do that.

1290
02:07:55,640 --> 02:08:00,760
Vilho. Go ask grandma to come here.

1291
02:08:48,560 --> 02:08:54,749
Fear not, for God has set an end
to Satan's time as well.

1292
02:08:56,200 --> 02:09:02,799
Fear not, for Satan can only claim
our bodies, not our souls.

1293
02:09:03,560 --> 02:09:07,030
The courage displayed
by the deceased -

1294
02:09:07,160 --> 02:09:12,996
is an example of the ultimate price
of justice and truth.

1295
02:09:14,720 --> 02:09:20,829
Anxiety and fear have visited
our homes frequently as of late.

1296
02:09:21,600 --> 02:09:25,912
May God forgive these people,
if he can.

1297
02:09:26,800 --> 02:09:32,238
Maybe he can do that,
which we petty people can not.

1298
02:09:37,120 --> 02:09:40,317
The Pastor made
the Baron's funeral -

1299
02:09:40,440 --> 02:09:46,197
into a counterrevolutionary
agitation rally. We don't like that.

1300
02:09:46,320 --> 02:09:50,233
That subject was unavoidable
in this case.

1301
02:09:50,400 --> 02:09:56,509
I've condemned the murderers.
Surely you have no objections?

1302
02:09:56,640 --> 02:10:01,350
You should stick to the Gospel
instead of interpreting the law.

1303
02:10:01,480 --> 02:10:06,554
This is the second time you have
brought politics to the church.

1304
02:10:06,680 --> 02:10:10,958
We must place you under arrest
for the time being.

1305
02:10:11,440 --> 02:10:14,671
The bosses used to put
the poor into the poor house -

1306
02:10:14,800 --> 02:10:19,874
so it is only fitting that the poor
put the bosses in the same place.

1307
02:10:24,720 --> 02:10:28,599
I'll come with you.
-No need. There's nothing to fear.

1308
02:10:28,720 --> 02:10:32,952
Don't worry. I'm not worried.
-I'll come see you in the morning.

1309
02:10:33,080 --> 02:10:35,753
Bring a Bible. The small one.

1310
02:10:50,960 --> 02:10:56,478
Maybe I could put in a word
for the Pastor.

1311
02:10:56,920 --> 02:11:00,959
I thank you, Koskela,
but I don't think that's of any use.

1312
02:11:02,720 --> 02:11:05,917
But the child needs baptising.

1313
02:11:07,160 --> 02:11:11,756
Maybe I'll have a word.
-They wouldn't listen to you.

1314
02:11:11,880 --> 02:11:14,758
But thanks anyway.

1315
02:11:32,680 --> 02:11:36,468
Stand there, listen and shut up.

1316
02:11:36,600 --> 02:11:40,434
Do you remember them contracts
you had me do -

1317
02:11:40,560 --> 02:11:43,677
though you knew that
one man can't do them in a day?

1318
02:11:43,800 --> 02:11:47,759
Don't. Please, don't!

1319
02:11:48,040 --> 02:11:51,749
You shut up, you cow!

1320
02:11:51,920 --> 02:11:57,916
You! Harness a horse and take grain
to the church village headquarters.

1321
02:11:58,200 --> 02:12:00,839
Is this an order from
the headquarters?

1322
02:12:00,960 --> 02:12:05,476
We're as good a headquarters
as you're going to get!

1323
02:12:20,280 --> 02:12:22,316
Aku!

1324
02:12:23,880 --> 02:12:26,792
Is it bad?
-My leg doesn't hold.

1325
02:12:26,920 --> 02:12:29,593
Don't leave me.
They'll just kill me.

1326
02:12:29,840 --> 02:12:35,153
We must delay them so that they can
take the cannons and supplies out.

1327
02:12:35,800 --> 02:12:38,360
Go help Aku get to the rear.

1328
02:12:44,200 --> 02:12:46,236
Where's Ylöstalo?

1329
02:12:46,360 --> 02:12:50,876
He's organising the retreat.
All hell has broken loose.

1330
02:12:55,280 --> 02:12:58,955
They're giving us up so the
commanders can escape in time.

1331
02:12:59,080 --> 02:13:04,029
Finland's best forces are leaving.
I won't stay behind to be killed.

1332
02:13:04,160 --> 02:13:06,674
We must keep the positions.

1333
02:13:07,640 --> 02:13:09,835
Keep the positions!

1334
02:13:10,360 --> 02:13:14,239
Run, you bastards.
Run all the way home!

1335
02:13:19,840 --> 02:13:24,516
Stand on the carriage and shout
"Long live the revolution".

1336
02:13:28,440 --> 02:13:30,908
Long live the revolution!

1337
02:13:31,040 --> 02:13:33,634
Let it rip, with all your might!

1338
02:13:33,760 --> 02:13:37,150
Long live the revolution!

1339
02:13:38,800 --> 02:13:42,236
Have mercy, for the love of God.

1340
02:13:42,360 --> 02:13:46,194
Don't you start whining, you cow.

1341
02:13:46,320 --> 02:13:50,359
Do you remember when
my wife was near her due time?

1342
02:13:50,480 --> 02:13:56,430
You complained that
she's no good at working.

1343
02:13:56,560 --> 02:14:01,190
Now you'll bark
at the squirrel, bitch!

1344
02:14:04,920 --> 02:14:10,233
Bark at the goddamn squirrel of I'll
drop your husband like a grouse!

1345
02:14:16,560 --> 02:14:22,032
Shoot me if you want to, but be man
enough to leave a woman alone.

1346
02:14:22,920 --> 02:14:26,435
A revolutionary soldier
doesn't abandon his comrades.

1347
02:14:26,560 --> 02:14:29,438
Remember the wounded.

1348
02:14:29,560 --> 02:14:32,791
Healthy men, off the sleigh!

1349
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:37,551
We want the horse to carry
the wounded! -Ease down, dammit!

1350
02:14:45,560 --> 02:14:49,917
If you leave the wounded, I shoot
first the horse and then the man.

1351
02:14:56,520 --> 02:15:00,832
Come with us, father.
You'll be safe there.

1352
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,150
They can come back.

1353
02:15:03,280 --> 02:15:06,909
Those people have given up
their right to live.

1354
02:15:07,040 --> 02:15:11,272
Don't leave one seed of their
families to haunt this land.

1355
02:15:11,400 --> 02:15:17,919
If I'm not there on that day, you
take care of it. -They're done for.

1356
02:15:18,040 --> 02:15:21,635
Let them have their fun now.
It'll soon be over.

1357
02:15:21,760 --> 02:15:25,469
But you keep your heads down.

1358
02:15:30,480 --> 02:15:35,474
Many of you think that
this is no use. I understand that.

1359
02:15:35,600 --> 02:15:40,116
I have a family,
and would like to go to them too.

1360
02:15:40,280 --> 02:15:43,750
But have you thought about what's
going to happen then?

1361
02:15:43,880 --> 02:15:46,917
"Others will take care
of the front." Who?

1362
02:15:47,040 --> 02:15:51,875
There are no others, our company
is no different from any other.

1363
02:15:53,280 --> 02:15:59,276
There are rumours that the butchers
want the commanders, not the men.

1364
02:15:59,400 --> 02:16:04,235
If that were true,
I would turn myself in right away.

1365
02:16:04,360 --> 02:16:08,353
It's better that a few of us die
instead of everyone.

1366
02:16:08,560 --> 02:16:13,509
Believe me,
the butchers will not stop at that.

1367
02:16:14,400 --> 02:16:19,428
We're not fighting for the workers'
cause anymore, but for survival!

1368
02:16:21,720 --> 02:16:26,714
I'm not much of a speaker.
Make up your own minds.

1369
02:16:34,320 --> 02:16:37,710
There are no hospitals anymore.

1370
02:16:37,840 --> 02:16:40,638
You can take care
of that wound at home too.

1371
02:16:40,760 --> 02:16:45,197
What will I tell them at home?
-Say what you think is right.

1372
02:16:45,360 --> 02:16:47,715
Try to explain.

1373
02:16:48,680 --> 02:16:52,070
Take that, I won't need it.

1374
02:16:52,480 --> 02:16:54,596
You should make it all right.

1375
02:16:54,720 --> 02:16:57,837
You have nothing bad
on your conscience.

1376
02:16:58,960 --> 02:17:02,077
And try to take care of them.

1377
02:17:02,680 --> 02:17:04,511
Bye.

1378
02:17:14,800 --> 02:17:19,112
I'll try to get us permission
to visit home when we retreat.

1379
02:17:19,280 --> 02:17:24,274
I didn't want to tell Aku
so they won't wait for us.

1380
02:17:46,200 --> 02:17:49,670
What is that strange glow?

1381
02:17:54,240 --> 02:17:56,959
Fires have broken out.

1382
02:17:57,080 --> 02:17:59,640
Jesus Lord.

1383
02:18:07,320 --> 02:18:11,393
The Whites will break through
tomorrow afternoon at the latest.

1384
02:18:11,520 --> 02:18:15,195
We'll have to be gone before that.

1385
02:18:17,960 --> 02:18:20,952
Maybe the boys should go with you.

1386
02:18:23,360 --> 02:18:26,636
I'm not telling them to do anything.

1387
02:18:26,760 --> 02:18:30,912
But their lives aren't in danger.
I think they should stay back.

1388
02:18:31,080 --> 02:18:36,154
The boys have nothing coming
to them. It's different for me.

1389
02:18:40,120 --> 02:18:43,874
I could try anyway.
Talk to the Pastor.

1390
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:48,039
No way! Don't beg
in front of that man for me.

1391
02:18:48,640 --> 02:18:52,918
Do that for the boys, not for me!
-Ease down, son.

1392
02:18:53,040 --> 02:18:56,077
It's time to swallow your pride.

1393
02:18:57,840 --> 02:19:02,277
Aku, someone's asking for you.
-The Laurila girl is hanging around.

1394
02:19:02,400 --> 02:19:08,589
Them people better leave as well,
after what they did to master Töyry.

1395
02:19:12,240 --> 02:19:16,597
Are you leaving?
-It won't work.

1396
02:19:16,720 --> 02:19:18,950
Let's take a horse and cart.

1397
02:19:19,080 --> 02:19:22,231
Why would you leave?
They leave women alone.

1398
02:19:22,360 --> 02:19:27,150
Mum says I have to.
But she and father will stay.

1399
02:19:27,280 --> 02:19:32,308
Uuno and I have to leave.
Otherwise we'll all get killed.

1400
02:19:35,360 --> 02:19:40,195
Father doesn't want to leave.
They're going to find him.

1401
02:19:41,120 --> 02:19:44,476
There must be some way
to sort this out.

1402
02:19:44,600 --> 02:19:47,990
You'll come back when it's over.

1403
02:19:52,600 --> 02:19:57,196
Don't think of us when you're
out there. It'll be easier for you.

1404
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:02,232
It's hardest that you are here
thinking of me.

1405
02:20:02,360 --> 02:20:06,911
I would be okay alone,
but I'm in charge of the refugees.

1406
02:20:07,240 --> 02:20:11,199
What will I do
with a caravan like that?

1407
02:20:12,280 --> 02:20:15,590
There's no hope
anymore anyway.

1408
02:20:15,720 --> 02:20:18,553
What will happen now?

1409
02:20:18,680 --> 02:20:21,831
We'll try to break through
to Russia.

1410
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:26,232
But I'll be back when I can.

1411
02:20:27,960 --> 02:20:31,430
I don't know how to live
without you.

1412
02:20:37,160 --> 02:20:42,871
Shall I wake the boys?
-Don't.

1413
02:20:45,280 --> 02:20:48,192
It's better that way.

1414
02:20:55,640 --> 02:20:58,313
Name him Voitto (= Victor).

1415
02:20:59,960 --> 02:21:02,076
Goodbye.

1416
02:21:02,760 --> 02:21:06,514
Don't cry now,
we must stand firm.

1417
02:21:24,760 --> 02:21:28,719
Where's Aku?
-By the drying barn.

1418
02:21:29,800 --> 02:21:33,395
Well... Bye then.

1419
02:21:57,760 --> 02:22:01,230
It's about time for Elma to leave.

1420
02:22:01,360 --> 02:22:04,591
You must be at the church
by midday.

1421
02:22:13,760 --> 02:22:16,479
You'll have your own
horse and driver.

1422
02:22:16,600 --> 02:22:20,149
I'm too weak for that road.

1423
02:22:20,280 --> 02:22:24,671
If I fall here,
at least I'll fall in my home.

1424
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:30,231
Well, goodbye then.

1425
02:22:30,520 --> 02:22:34,433
Goodbye. I wish you luck.

1426
02:22:42,600 --> 02:22:47,628
Let's go to the headquarters!
-In the middle of the night? Why?

1427
02:22:47,840 --> 02:22:52,834
Headquarters' orders. If you
don't go, you'll die right there.

1428
02:23:00,120 --> 02:23:04,910
Do you remember all the old stuff?
Now is the time.

1429
02:23:06,120 --> 02:23:09,795
I haven't done any wrong
that I know of.

1430
02:23:10,360 --> 02:23:14,273
You've been waiting for this day
like a steed for summer-

1431
02:23:14,400 --> 02:23:17,358
but you won't see
the butchers celebrate.

1432
02:23:18,360 --> 02:23:20,112
Stop!

1433
02:23:22,320 --> 02:23:27,678
Our Father, who art in Heaven.
Hallowed be thy...

1434
02:23:39,440 --> 02:23:46,676
Because of you and your bad deeds
the innocent are punished.

1435
02:23:46,800 --> 02:23:51,749
This authorises the confiscation.
Be at the church by eleven.

1436
02:23:51,880 --> 02:23:56,396
Do you have to do the confiscation?
People are staying behind.

1437
02:23:56,520 --> 02:24:00,115
We have to. Otherwise
the refugees will go hungry.

1438
02:24:00,240 --> 02:24:02,834
We need horses and food.

1439
02:24:02,960 --> 02:24:06,270
Don't you weep, old woman.

1440
02:24:23,080 --> 02:24:25,833
Are you on guard?

1441
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,878
I'm just checking out what happens.

1442
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:35,233
Give that rifle to Oskari. Don't
keep it under any circumstances.

1443
02:24:35,600 --> 02:24:40,116
And say that you were
forced to join the Guard.

1444
02:24:40,240 --> 02:24:42,800
Goodbye now.

1445
02:24:43,400 --> 02:24:46,472
Try to make it as best you can.

1446
02:26:03,440 --> 02:26:05,510
Who are you, old man?

1447
02:26:05,640 --> 02:26:09,428
Me? The name is Kivivuori.

1448
02:26:09,760 --> 02:26:14,436
Are there Reds in the village?
-They left yesterday.

1449
02:26:15,600 --> 02:26:18,990
If you're lying, you'll die.

1450
02:26:19,560 --> 02:26:23,394
Go see for yourself
if you don't believe.

1451
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,912
We've been waiting for you so much.

1452
02:26:35,040 --> 02:26:40,034
I'm the pastor of this municipality
and would like to bid you welcome.

1453
02:26:45,120 --> 02:26:48,669
Where's Uuno?
-He's gone, you know that.

1454
02:26:48,800 --> 02:26:54,193
We'll find him, no matter what. And
you'll soon walk through the gates!

1455
02:26:54,320 --> 02:26:57,790
Shoot me now!
Why walk me around?

1456
02:26:57,920 --> 02:27:01,629
You'll have some time to think.
Walk!

1457
02:27:14,400 --> 02:27:17,870
All right.
Put on some clothes and go.

1458
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:21,231
Did you come for me?
-Didn't I say that already?

1459
02:27:21,360 --> 02:27:28,072
You know I oppose violence.
-Is that so? Let's go now.

1460
02:27:34,640 --> 02:27:40,351
Did Akseli leave?
-Yes. He's gone.

1461
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:45,755
There is a new rule on the land now.
Remember that, Elina.

1462
02:27:45,880 --> 02:27:51,398
Boys, come with us.
-They haven't done any harm.

1463
02:27:51,520 --> 02:27:55,035
If there's nothing...
Everyone will be investigated.

1464
02:27:55,160 --> 02:28:01,599
I don't know about the boys,
but Akseli better stay in hiding.

1465
02:28:03,040 --> 02:28:05,156
Hurry up!

1466
02:28:14,560 --> 02:28:17,233
Vilho...

1467
02:28:22,400 --> 02:28:24,834
Keep that for yourself.

1468
02:28:35,360 --> 02:28:37,590
What is it? Butchers?

1469
02:28:37,720 --> 02:28:40,678
They say we can't go through Lahti.

1470
02:28:40,800 --> 02:28:44,031
Line up, everyone
who is able to fire a rifle.

1471
02:28:44,160 --> 02:28:47,118
Put that gun away.
-I can go as well as you.

1472
02:28:47,240 --> 02:28:50,869
If you weren't such cowards,
we wouldn't be in this mess.

1473
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:53,468
Come on, take guns!

1474
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:01,879
Come on! What are you afraid of?

1475
02:29:02,320 --> 02:29:04,038
Charge!

1476
02:29:11,720 --> 02:29:14,154
Is everything all right?

1477
02:29:14,320 --> 02:29:16,595
Ilmari!

1478
02:29:23,920 --> 02:29:27,993
So, the following night
three men arrived at the manor.

1479
02:29:28,120 --> 02:29:30,714
The men weren't looking for guns -

1480
02:29:30,840 --> 02:29:35,755
but they took the baron with them
and murdered him on a nearby bridge.

1481
02:29:37,200 --> 02:29:39,270
What do you say to this?

1482
02:29:39,400 --> 02:29:42,790
You know my principles, gentlemen.

1483
02:29:42,920 --> 02:29:46,310
Questions like that
serve no purpose.

1484
02:29:46,680 --> 02:29:49,831
Do you admit
calling the local headquarters -

1485
02:29:49,960 --> 02:29:53,839
and asking for these men
to be sent to the manor?

1486
02:29:53,960 --> 02:30:00,274
I made that call, but I didn't...
-Do you plead guilty to this murder?

1487
02:30:00,400 --> 02:30:03,790
The accusation alone is insane.

1488
02:30:05,840 --> 02:30:08,400
Take him into the hallway.

1489
02:30:10,320 --> 02:30:15,394
I didn't accept the permit, and they
threatened to make me clean toilets.

1490
02:30:15,520 --> 02:30:20,878
Who threatened you? -Akseli Koskela,
he was the main boss here.

1491
02:30:21,320 --> 02:30:26,474
He was in charge of the looting. And
he sent two young men to be shot.

1492
02:30:26,600 --> 02:30:29,797
We made a grave mistake.

1493
02:30:29,920 --> 02:30:33,151
We practically pushed suffrage
down their throats.

1494
02:30:33,280 --> 02:30:37,068
Well, live without honour,
die without honour.

1495
02:30:37,360 --> 02:30:41,478
They'll die without honour,
no doubt about that.

1496
02:30:43,400 --> 02:30:46,870
For mutiny against the legal order -

1497
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:49,912
participation in
murder and looting -

1498
02:30:50,040 --> 02:30:53,715
and unlawful
deprivation of liberty -

1499
02:30:53,840 --> 02:30:57,879
you are sentenced to be
executed by firing squad.

1500
02:31:01,720 --> 02:31:05,599
Why don't you let me die
for my cause?

1501
02:31:05,720 --> 02:31:10,748
Do you have to disgrace me
by calling me a murderer?

1502
02:31:10,920 --> 02:31:14,674
That is a nonsensical accusation.

1503
02:31:14,800 --> 02:31:18,236
Haven't you given enough
agitation speeches?

1504
02:31:18,360 --> 02:31:21,636
I will die soon,
because you want it to happen.

1505
02:31:21,760 --> 02:31:24,354
But control your anger -

1506
02:31:24,480 --> 02:31:28,234
for in three weeks' time
you'll be wishing you had.

1507
02:31:28,360 --> 02:31:33,480
Gentlemen, you are the ones
to blame for this rebellion.

1508
02:31:33,680 --> 02:31:39,949
You're only shooting the ghosts
of your own ignorance and greed.

1509
02:31:40,160 --> 02:31:44,915
I've told you that you cannot kill
ghosts by shooting -

1510
02:31:45,040 --> 02:31:48,077
but you didn't listen.

1511
02:31:48,280 --> 02:31:53,035
So have mercy on yourselves
and give lenient sentences.

1512
02:31:54,080 --> 02:31:58,631
Gentlemen, behind my
veneer of insignificance -

1513
02:31:58,760 --> 02:32:04,357
lies a great witness:
the inevitable order of life.

1514
02:32:04,520 --> 02:32:09,435
The coming decades
will make you believe these words.

1515
02:32:24,640 --> 02:32:28,599
<i>Per aspera ad astra.</i>

1516
02:32:42,120 --> 02:32:45,999
About Jokinen.

1517
02:32:46,400 --> 02:32:50,029
It would be fine to shoot him -

1518
02:32:50,160 --> 02:32:54,392
but there's no-one else
to run the machine at the sawmill.

1519
02:32:54,880 --> 02:33:01,069
This winter's logs are still uncut,
and there's life after this also.

1520
02:33:02,120 --> 02:33:07,240
Fine, if it's like that.
We'll give him forced labour.

1521
02:33:07,360 --> 02:33:11,512
If I find another man,
shoot him then.

1522
02:33:11,680 --> 02:33:14,831
Is that a wagtail? This early?

1523
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:18,959
It's not a wagtail,
it's just nodding.

1524
02:33:20,720 --> 02:33:23,359
Off the carriage. Hurry!

1525
02:33:41,720 --> 02:33:43,631
Mother!

1526
02:33:43,760 --> 02:33:46,194
Run, girl, run!

1527
02:33:46,920 --> 02:33:49,229
Mother!

1528
02:34:02,680 --> 02:34:05,478
What do you want, Kivivuori?

1529
02:34:05,600 --> 02:34:09,639
I came to discuss the sentences
and the court as a whole.

1530
02:34:09,760 --> 02:34:14,390
What's there to discuss? -A lot.
Like the composition of the court.

1531
02:34:14,520 --> 02:34:17,398
Some of you
are obviously plaintiffs.

1532
02:34:17,520 --> 02:34:22,594
Can you find one law-abiding citizen
who's not a plaintiff?

1533
02:34:22,720 --> 02:34:26,872
In that case you should wait
for your heads to cool off.

1534
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:32,757
Kivivuori should stop
distorting the law and leave.

1535
02:34:32,880 --> 02:34:35,713
I've kept myself well clear
of the rebellion -

1536
02:34:35,840 --> 02:34:39,628
and resisted it more strongly
than you ever dared.

1537
02:34:39,760 --> 02:34:43,116
I would be better suited
to be in the court than you.

1538
02:34:43,240 --> 02:34:45,993
I told you to leave!

1539
02:34:46,120 --> 02:34:48,315
Well, do as you will then.

1540
02:34:48,440 --> 02:34:52,831
You'll fill a lot of graves,
but you won't be killing socialism.

1541
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:56,037
At least you'll get your whim.

1542
02:34:59,960 --> 02:35:07,958
In my opinion, the younger
Koskela brothers are good boys.

1543
02:35:08,080 --> 02:35:11,117
They've been led astray
by their older brother.

1544
02:35:11,240 --> 02:35:16,951
They hardly would have joined
the rebellion without him. -Right.

1545
02:35:18,080 --> 02:35:21,595
Right, about the Koskela boys.

1546
02:35:22,560 --> 02:35:28,317
For their father's sake as well,
he's a very good man.

1547
02:35:29,760 --> 02:35:33,150
Yes, he is.

1548
02:35:33,560 --> 02:35:37,951
Since the court disagrees,
we'll have to vote.

1549
02:35:52,920 --> 02:35:56,469
We got the bullet.
Both of us.

1550
02:35:58,960 --> 02:36:02,635
Tell them back home,
but don't let them come see us.

1551
02:36:07,280 --> 02:36:09,919
But if it isn't Valpri?

1552
02:36:10,040 --> 02:36:15,672
Your armband has faded badly.
I almost didn't recognise you.

1553
02:36:15,800 --> 02:36:18,553
<i>Ylöstalo, Kalle Armas!</i>

1554
02:36:28,480 --> 02:36:31,950
He went to the municipal building.

1555
02:36:35,080 --> 02:36:38,959
Jäger Lieutenant Ilmari Salpakari.

1556
02:36:39,080 --> 02:36:43,835
I have the honour of offering to you
our municipality's greetings.

1557
02:36:45,160 --> 02:36:48,869
To a Finnish Jäger,
from a thankful nation.

1558
02:36:52,040 --> 02:36:54,600
Thank you.

1559
02:37:09,920 --> 02:37:12,912
That's ugly.

1560
02:37:14,680 --> 02:37:20,312
The road is cut off.
-They say there are Germans ahead.

1561
02:37:21,120 --> 02:37:25,159
What do we do?
-We must try and break through.

1562
02:37:56,120 --> 02:37:59,237
Don't cry, dear child.

1563
02:37:59,720 --> 02:38:03,235
One must be tough in this world.

1564
02:38:04,240 --> 02:38:08,995
One must not break down.

1565
02:38:13,280 --> 02:38:16,556
You know they don't mean any harm,
Mr Pastor.

1566
02:38:16,680 --> 02:38:21,879
I tried all I could,
I gave a good statement on the boys.

1567
02:38:26,880 --> 02:38:29,440
But the hatred is so strong.

1568
02:38:29,560 --> 02:38:33,155
The murders...
-But not our boys.

1569
02:38:33,280 --> 02:38:36,989
I realise this is very hard for you.

1570
02:38:37,280 --> 02:38:39,714
I could try to put in one more word.

1571
02:38:39,840 --> 02:38:44,868
But you should go yourself.
They listen to the father better.

1572
02:39:04,480 --> 02:39:08,792
What's the matter with you?
-Nothing.

1573
02:39:10,240 --> 02:39:13,152
You're not crying for nothing,
are you?

1574
02:39:13,280 --> 02:39:15,555
How is that your business?

1575
02:39:15,680 --> 02:39:19,992
Go to hell, I can cry if I want to.

1576
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:32,834
The sentences will now be carried
out, under my supervision.

1577
02:39:32,960 --> 02:39:35,713
Halme, Aadolf Aleksander.
-Present.

1578
02:39:35,840 --> 02:39:38,434
Laurila, Anton Kustaa.

1579
02:39:38,800 --> 02:39:42,236
Daddy! Daddy!

1580
02:39:42,600 --> 02:39:46,912
Koskela, Aleksis Johannes.
Koskela, August Johannes. -Present.

1581
02:39:47,560 --> 02:39:50,233
Ylöstalo, Kalle Armas.
-Present.

1582
02:39:50,360 --> 02:39:52,237
Move!

1583
02:39:54,080 --> 02:39:55,832
<i>Daddy!</i>

1584
02:39:58,640 --> 02:40:02,553
Daddy... Daddy!

1585
02:40:04,280 --> 02:40:07,511
Daddy!

1586
02:40:19,800 --> 02:40:23,395
Let me help.
-No! I can do it.

1587
02:40:27,800 --> 02:40:30,075
Silence! No singing.

1588
02:40:33,080 --> 02:40:36,152
You can't order us any more.

1589
02:40:37,840 --> 02:40:41,071
So the socialists
are singing hymns now?

1590
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:53,877
Halt!

1591
02:40:55,480 --> 02:40:58,472
Halme and Ylöstalo, stand there.

1592
02:40:59,800 --> 02:41:05,079
You can turn your backs if you wish.
Ylöstalo, take your place.

1593
02:41:13,640 --> 02:41:15,631
Goodbye, comrades.

1594
02:41:15,760 --> 02:41:19,673
I take refuge in God's mercy
as I die. -Attention!

1595
02:41:21,080 --> 02:41:23,719
But I am innocent before man.
-Fire!

1596
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:33,514
Silander and Laurila!

1597
02:41:33,760 --> 02:41:36,399
I have something to say
to this pair.

1598
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:42,834
Bury me standing, so you'll need
to waste less land on me!

1599
02:41:42,960 --> 02:41:44,632
Fire!

1600
02:41:47,560 --> 02:41:49,949
The Koskela brothers!

1601
02:41:59,640 --> 02:42:01,915
Which way shall we stand?

1602
02:42:02,040 --> 02:42:04,429
Face forward.

1603
02:42:06,400 --> 02:42:10,075
Goodbye, and don't be afraid.

1604
02:42:10,200 --> 02:42:12,475
Attention!

1605
02:42:14,440 --> 02:42:16,476
Fire!

1606
02:42:32,720 --> 02:42:37,236
I crossed master Halme's hands.

1607
02:42:38,920 --> 02:42:42,037
Although they kind
of told me not to.

1608
02:42:42,160 --> 02:42:46,836
When you go to Koskela house,
don't speak of the boys' bodies.

1609
02:42:48,080 --> 02:42:52,710
Just say they looked peaceful,
like sleeping.

1610
02:42:52,960 --> 02:42:56,475
You know what to say.

1611
02:42:59,440 --> 02:43:04,992
They looked like they were sleeping.
No bullet holes or anything.

1612
02:43:06,560 --> 02:43:11,190
I took Aleksi's good overcoat.

1613
02:43:11,320 --> 02:43:15,791
I'd buy it from you,
if you don't need.

1614
02:43:15,920 --> 02:43:19,799
You can have Aleksi's other jacket.

1615
02:43:20,120 --> 02:43:24,671
It's so hard to see it
on someone else.

1616
02:43:26,320 --> 02:43:30,029
Master Halme was the same as ever.

1617
02:43:30,160 --> 02:43:34,870
They boys were
kind of smiling even.

1618
02:43:39,200 --> 02:43:43,910
Is it my turn? We don't have
anyone else left to shoot.

1619
02:43:44,040 --> 02:43:46,508
I want to speak to Elina.

1620
02:43:47,320 --> 02:43:53,156
Elina Koskela gets special tasks,
since she's the headman's wife.

1621
02:43:53,320 --> 02:43:56,198
The commandant's orders.

1622
02:44:00,480 --> 02:44:05,031
We do this every Saturday,
and it's never been funny before.

1623
02:44:05,760 --> 02:44:09,958
How indecent can you get?
Go home, Elina.

1624
02:44:10,080 --> 02:44:12,753
Commandant Salpakari
ordered this.

1625
02:44:12,880 --> 02:44:17,556
I don't care if it was Mannerheim.
It's indecent all the same.

1626
02:44:22,480 --> 02:44:28,191
Would it be possible
to bury them in hallowed ground?

1627
02:44:28,720 --> 02:44:34,352
Not just yet. People have objected
to burying them in the churchyard.

1628
02:44:34,480 --> 02:44:39,634
But we have the grave
that we bought.

1629
02:44:40,240 --> 02:44:43,198
Yes, you do have the grave.

1630
02:44:45,120 --> 02:44:47,953
But let's wait for
the hate to subside a bit.

1631
02:44:48,120 --> 02:44:50,793
The boys never hurt anybody.

1632
02:44:50,920 --> 02:44:54,674
As I understand, they weren't
accused of hurting anyone.

1633
02:44:54,800 --> 02:44:57,394
They were accused of
armed rebellion.

1634
02:44:57,520 --> 02:45:02,548
Listen. I still have one
very nasty thing to tell you.

1635
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:06,231
Akseli hasn't paid rent
for the tenancy -

1636
02:45:06,360 --> 02:45:11,992
and the congregation's board have
taken it as a termination of lease.

1637
02:45:13,560 --> 02:45:15,551
I see.

1638
02:45:15,680 --> 02:45:19,468
It doesn't concern you, only Akseli.

1639
02:45:20,280 --> 02:45:22,236
Right.

1640
02:45:34,320 --> 02:45:37,278
Charge! Forward!

1641
02:45:44,680 --> 02:45:48,195
Osku, get down..!

1642
02:45:49,560 --> 02:45:51,790
Osku!

1643
02:45:55,840 --> 02:45:58,195
Osku.

1644
02:47:21,400 --> 02:47:24,198
There you are.

1645
02:47:25,200 --> 02:47:29,352
We want this man first.
-Is he well known?

1646
02:47:29,480 --> 02:47:32,790
Very well indeed,
he's Akseli Koskela!

1647
02:47:33,120 --> 02:47:37,750
So, Koskela, many people
back home are missing you.

1648
02:47:37,880 --> 02:47:42,158
You cannot have him.
He's important for our intelligence.

1649
02:47:42,280 --> 02:47:47,149
You should be next to
Halme and your brothers.

1650
02:47:47,920 --> 02:47:50,388
Where are they then?

1651
02:47:50,600 --> 02:47:55,196
They're in the ground.
And you will be soon, too.

1652
02:47:55,320 --> 02:48:00,713
But we're taking Laurila back.
We have some unfinished business.

1653
02:48:00,840 --> 02:48:04,799
Where are the church villagers?
-We don't know.

1654
02:48:04,920 --> 02:48:08,037
We've been in our own group.

1655
02:48:08,320 --> 02:48:12,757
We'll find them all right.
And we won't forget you either.

1656
02:48:12,880 --> 02:48:15,713
Don't remember me badly, sister.

1657
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:25,437
You're a company commander.
Why haven't you reported yourself?

1658
02:48:25,560 --> 02:48:30,076
Nobody asked.
-Follow me.

1659
02:48:59,920 --> 02:49:03,913
Koskela, Akseli Johannes!

1660
02:49:06,640 --> 02:49:10,679
Tell me, how many murders have you
got on your conscience? -None.

1661
02:49:10,800 --> 02:49:13,997
No bloody wonder.

1662
02:49:15,240 --> 02:49:18,232
That's because
you have no conscience.

1663
02:49:18,360 --> 02:49:20,396
Which do you prefer:

1664
02:49:20,520 --> 02:49:24,718
will we send you home to be shot,
or would you rather die here?

1665
02:49:24,840 --> 02:49:27,400
Here.

1666
02:49:32,080 --> 02:49:36,278
You're one of the
most wanted men back home.

1667
02:49:37,280 --> 02:49:41,068
I can see it in your eyes
that you're a bandit.

1668
02:49:41,640 --> 02:49:44,279
Stand to attention!
I'm an officer!

1669
02:49:44,400 --> 02:49:46,994
Don't touch me!

1670
02:49:55,880 --> 02:49:58,314
Number one.

1671
02:50:06,560 --> 02:50:10,792
Water Water.

1672
02:50:17,320 --> 02:50:19,959
Where are we?

1673
02:51:10,920 --> 02:51:14,037
Give these to Valenti.

1674
02:51:14,160 --> 02:51:18,756
I'm doing cleaning work for a
sergeant major, he gave me bread.

1675
02:51:19,280 --> 02:51:24,513
Don't insist.
Just ask once in a while.

1676
02:51:52,480 --> 02:51:54,994
Goodbye.

1677
02:53:23,680 --> 02:53:27,559
They're making the Reds white,
goddammit.

1678
02:53:27,680 --> 02:53:31,434
Has the prisoner been an agitator?
-Yes, a leading soul.

1679
02:53:31,560 --> 02:53:34,028
For revolution?
-Yes, a leading soul.

1680
02:53:34,160 --> 02:53:37,755
Against the legitimate government?
-Yes, a leading soul.

1681
02:53:37,880 --> 02:53:40,838
Read the statement
from his home municipality.

1682
02:53:40,960 --> 02:53:45,192
"We view the prisoner as completely
useless and a menace to society -

1683
02:53:45,320 --> 02:53:49,552
and unable to function
as a member of organised society."

1684
02:53:49,680 --> 02:53:54,276
"We demand the hardest penalty
there is, the penalty of death."

1685
02:53:54,520 --> 02:53:59,071
"A. Yllö, civil judge,
A. Mellola, sawmill owner-

1686
02:53:59,200 --> 02:54:02,749
Hjalmar Pajunen, farmer."

1687
02:54:03,680 --> 02:54:07,673
For partaking in murder and looting,
treason and high treason -

1688
02:54:07,800 --> 02:54:10,394
the prisoner is issued
the death penalty -

1689
02:54:10,520 --> 02:54:13,751
and sentenced to lose
his civil rights for all time.

1690
02:54:13,880 --> 02:54:16,314
As this verdict was
the result of a vote -

1691
02:54:16,440 --> 02:54:19,716
it will be reviewed
by the state criminal court.

1692
02:54:19,840 --> 02:54:24,789
In addition, you are free
to petition the said court.

1693
02:54:25,440 --> 02:54:29,228
<i>If this is my last letter,</i>
<i>I bid you farewell.</i>

1694
02:54:29,360 --> 02:54:33,831
<i>It's better that you don't know</i>
<i>the date and time -</i>

1695
02:54:33,960 --> 02:54:36,952
<i>but I'll remember you when it comes.</i>

1696
02:54:37,080 --> 02:54:40,038
<i>Your husband and father</i>
<i>Akseli Koskela.</i>

1697
02:54:40,160 --> 02:54:44,870
<i>If you write to me, you need to</i>
<i>label the letters "condemned".</i>

1698
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:48,834
They're going to kill him. They are.

1699
02:54:49,440 --> 02:54:52,193
I'll go too, I won't be left alone.

1700
02:54:52,320 --> 02:54:56,950
Don't, for God's sake.
Think of the children.

1701
02:55:26,560 --> 02:55:29,199
I have some news.

1702
02:55:29,320 --> 02:55:32,949
We've been able to undo
Akseli's eviction.

1703
02:55:33,520 --> 02:55:35,829
I see.

1704
02:56:20,480 --> 02:56:23,119
I heard a rumour -

1705
02:56:23,240 --> 02:56:27,631
that some death sentences will be
changed into life imprisonment.

1706
02:56:27,760 --> 02:56:32,151
What would you say about that?
-I'm too tired to think.

1707
02:56:32,480 --> 02:56:37,600
I've heard rumours before,
but I didn't want to say anything.

1708
02:56:37,720 --> 02:56:41,759
But now I can tell you
that it is true.

1709
02:56:41,920 --> 02:56:44,673
Here's a letter from him.

1710
02:56:44,800 --> 02:56:49,794
Don't start bawling right away,
but he's been saved.

1711
02:56:51,120 --> 02:56:56,035
It's a long time all right,
but I'm sure it will be reduced.

1712
02:56:58,480 --> 02:57:05,079
What do I care about years?
He'll live!

1713
