1
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,451
Once upon a time, two years ago...

2
00:00:53,953 --> 00:00:57,013
five lives were suddenly
transformed.

3
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,822
One got a second chance.

4
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,057
One got old.

5
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:14,362
One became young again.

6
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:28,243
One got a raw deal.

7
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,964
And one hit the jackpot.

8
00:01:53,847 --> 00:02:00,047
Five bodies, five souls,
one story that changed my life.

9
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:11,954
Stef!

10
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,563
Wake up!

11
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:21,607
This is the day we've been waiting for.
Good morning!

12
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,332
Good morning, Mom.

13
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:27,903
This is the big day, my princess.
Did you sleep well?

14
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:33,383
- Yes Mom, 8 hours more or less.
- That's just enough.

15
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:37,990
More than that
and your skin gets puffy.

16
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:42,784
What's the weather forecast?

17
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:47,492
ls it going to rain,
or is it clear skies all day?

18
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:53,334
Of course!
We picked the best date.

19
00:02:53,506 --> 00:03:00,002
There's a solar eclipse today
and it will be clear.

20
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:05,413
ln some cultures,
solar eclipses are considered lucky.

21
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:11,221
- Really?
- Yes. Come on.

22
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:17,627
- Mom, l'm nervous.
- Don't be such a baby.

23
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:22,495
lt's the nicest day
for a beach wedding.

24
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:26,037
Come, hug Mama.

25
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,465
My princess.

26
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:32,811
When you do the groceries
don't forget the dog food.

27
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:33,708
Check.

28
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:35,973
- And the dog shampoo.
- Check.

29
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:40,347
And don't forget to call Jim-Jim the
dog shooter, Mrs. Covarrubias' son.

30
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:42,215
His Shih Tzu is in heat...

31
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:46,381
you have to schedule a breeding session
for Bogart so he'll stop sulking.

32
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:53,056
Oh, Bogart! My baby's a big boy,
he's ready to mate!

33
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:55,757
Lucky Bogart, he has a love life.

34
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:58,130
- What did you say?
- Nothing, Ma'am.

35
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:02,536
l said l'd call Jim-Jim
the son of Mrs. Covarrubias.

36
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:05,439
l heard you. lf we were in court
you'd be cited for contempt.

37
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:06,704
Where is Mr. Pedring the driver?

38
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:08,507
l don't want to be stuck
on EDSA at rush hour.

39
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:13,051
He sent a text message
that he can't drive you today.

40
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:15,654
He has lactose intolerance.

41
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:18,655
Mr. Pedring has lactose intolerance?
ls that correct, yes or no?

42
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:19,553
Yes.

43
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:21,225
How swanky of him,
a rich people's ailment.

44
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:23,761
Get my driving shoes from
the closet.

45
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,024
So many churches in Manila...

46
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:28,930
and they choose to get married
on the beach.

47
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:32,128
Oh it's a wedding you're attending.

48
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:35,999
l thought you were going
to a baptism.

49
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:38,576
So you're a godmother
at weddings now.

50
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:42,872
Yes. Accept the truth
that l have long accepted.

51
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:46,474
l am of age to stand as godmother
at weddings, is that correct?

52
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:47,813
Yes, Ma'am.

53
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:49,545
Godmother at weddings...

54
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:52,214
do you want me to underline
and highlight that for you?

55
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:57,295
l'll even spell it. W-E-D-D-l-N-G-S.

56
00:04:57,697 --> 00:05:00,723
l am the godmother to the daughter
of my best friend from high school!

57
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:01,924
You got that?

58
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:05,798
lf you're through annoying me,
get my loafers before you get hurt!

59
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:10,037
Yes, Ma'am. Enjoy your breakfast. Alone!

60
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:20,175
Bogart! Bogart!

61
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:28,792
Nanny, make sure lñaki
does number two.

62
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:31,055
lt's hard to find a bathroom
on the way there.

63
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:33,354
Yes, Ma'am.

64
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:38,027
lt's too early for poo-poo.
Can l bring my toys?

65
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:41,296
Okay, but not all of them.

66
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:43,841
Nanny, his toys.

67
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:47,144
What's taking you so long?

68
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:50,041
We're going to get stuck in traffic,
get moving.

69
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:51,841
Yes, Sir, good morning.

70
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:54,214
Have you seen my diver's watch?

71
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:57,247
l don't know, ask the maid.

72
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:01,283
Sir, l checked the air in the tires.

73
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,624
What about the gas?

74
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:06,163
Enough to get us there,
we can fill up on the way back.

75
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:11,233
lñaki, finish your food.
Don't get up until you've finished.

76
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:14,102
Where's my diver's watch?

77
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:16,668
Daddy says eat.

78
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,504
Good morning. See you later.

79
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:27,109
Nanny is flirting with the driver!
l'll tell Mommy.

80
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:30,780
Be quiet. Eat your bacon and eggs
so you'll grow big and strong.

81
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:35,553
l don't want to be big and strong,
l want to be rich and powerful.

82
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:38,888
Come on, eat your eggs.

83
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:42,329
Eating eggs everyday
will turn me into a girl.

84
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,729
Alright, just the bacon.

85
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:49,238
That's high in cholesterol.
Do you want me to die early?

86
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:51,974
Please eat.

87
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:56,548
After this l have to give
you a bath and get you dressed...

88
00:06:56,649 --> 00:07:00,483
then we're going on a long drive
and we can't be late...

89
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,951
because you're the ring-bearer
at the wedding.

90
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:05,387
They can't start without me.

91
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:07,857
You horrid brat.

92
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:09,518
You little demon.

93
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:16,533
The minute l pay off my
parent's debts, l'm leaving you.

94
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:19,770
Pest. Demon. Troll!

95
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:23,274
Nanny, you're speaking Bisaya again.

96
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:29,073
You must be saying bad words.
l'm telling Mommy!

97
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:31,812
Whatever!

98
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:35,943
- lt's not Bisaya, it's llonggo.
- Whatever, Nanny.

99
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:40,892
Eat... Eat...

100
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:56,237
(Coughing)

101
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:10,382
Are we bringing that oxygen tank?

102
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:12,586
That's what the doctor
and your son said.

103
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:15,694
They should've had
the wedding in the lCU.

104
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,853
Sir, we have to be prepared.

105
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,455
Prepared for what?
You're all paranoid.

106
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:37,414
Where are you putting that?

107
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,678
Didn't l tell you l'm not riding
that wheelchair?

108
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:42,913
Sir, your son said to bring it.

109
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:46,991
Who is paying for this wedding,
him or me?

110
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:48,855
Does he give orders now?

111
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:54,323
Take that down! Right this second!

112
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:56,594
Sir, l'll get reprimanded.

113
00:08:57,069 --> 00:09:00,334
Goddamnit, take down
that wheelchair instantly!

114
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:03,101
Sir, if you don't want to ride it,
then don't.

115
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:08,038
But your son specifically
told me to bring it.

116
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:10,712
Then he should ride that wheelchair.

117
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:14,311
Why don't we get in the car.

118
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:37,274
l left my checkbook
in the clutch bag, get it.

119
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:57,393
Sir, here it is.

120
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:29,160
The late Toffee Carbonell.

121
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,739
- l'll miss you, baby.
- Have to go.

122
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:56,177
- Bye, love you.
- No kiss?

123
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:03,124
Here's your coffee.

124
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:07,760
- 1 1 seconds.
- What?

125
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:12,337
l timed your embrace. 1 1 seconds.

126
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:16,975
How long will you be parted?
l thought this was a day trip.

127
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:19,044
What was your breakfast,
hot sour soup?

128
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:22,808
lt's too early for sourness.
Not even a thank you for the coffee?

129
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:25,907
lgnore her, Sister,
she's been like that since yesterday.

130
00:11:57,249 --> 00:12:00,377
- Shit.
- Huh?

131
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:07,916
l'd understand if you and your ex
had split up a week ago.

132
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,652
Even a month ago.

133
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:13,992
But it's been 3 months...

134
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:18,160
and you were only together
for one month.

135
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:21,899
Your recovery is longer
than the actual relationship.

136
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:27,075
Sister, aren't you tired?
We're so tired for you.

137
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:28,703
Butt out!

138
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:31,740
You never learn.

139
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:37,579
How self-righteous you are.
Just because you have lovers.

140
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:44,854
Sister, it's your fault because you
always fall for boys who like girls.

141
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:45,794
Correct.

142
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:50,368
Why don't you open your heart
to boys who like boys?

143
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,835
Yucch! Like you?

144
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:57,702
With boyfriends as gay as yourselves?
Over my dead, sexy body.

145
00:12:57,877 --> 00:13:03,144
Then suffer.
Your gayness is so Seventies.

146
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:06,250
- lt's a new millennium!
- Exactly.

147
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:10,012
You're such
a stereotypical gay beautician.

148
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:13,684
Excuse me, l am not a beautician.

149
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:17,260
l am an image stylist.

150
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:21,666
Let's go!
Before you make me vomit.

151
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:25,861
- And the road trip is on!
- How long is the drive?

152
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:29,704
According to the map, 3 to 4 hours.

153
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:30,798
That's so far!

154
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:32,171
lmage stylist?
l wonder what that is?

155
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:35,873
- lt's not far, go to sleep.
- The sourness!

156
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:37,209
The bitterness!

157
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:29,290
Your Auntie Carla called last night.
She wishes you the best.

158
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:32,598
She insists that you stay with her
when you visit L.A.

159
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:35,640
Your cousins are excited
to meet Harold.

160
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:39,539
l'll tell Harold.
lf it's alright with him, why not.

161
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:41,442
l'm sure it is.

162
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:44,715
Speaking of...

163
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:49,009
- Hi, Babe.
- Babe, are you on the road?

164
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:52,884
- Yes, we're on our way.
- Good.

165
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:57,624
l told you, the house
is only 30 minutes away.

166
00:14:57,763 --> 00:14:59,924
l can't wait to see you.

167
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:04,267
- Excited!
- More excited for the honeymoon.

168
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:10,866
Stop that, l'm with my mother.
lt's so embarrassing.

169
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:14,502
- So?
- Stop that.

170
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:23,953
Babe, could you check the wedding
souvenirs with the suppliers?

171
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:27,422
- l hope there's no problem.
- l've seen them.

172
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:30,186
Are they tasteful?

173
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:32,059
- Very appropriate.
- Good.

174
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:35,600
- Are you near?
- Yes, we're near.

175
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:39,101
Stop that.

176
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,072
l don't have time for this!

177
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,973
l don't care if you camp out outside
City Hall the whole weekend...

178
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,240
just get me a copy
of that land title!

179
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:52,942
And tell Attorney Montinola...

180
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:56,248
the deposition from his witness
is useless!

181
00:15:56,822 --> 00:16:00,053
We need to win this
land dispute case at all cost.

182
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:06,021
What? l didn't get an email.

183
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:09,193
Wi-fi? l'm driving, you nitwit.

184
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:18,670
l don't want that!
How many times do l have to tell you?

185
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,302
Mommy, we have to go back
to the house!

186
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:22,971
lñaki, l told you to stop that.

187
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:24,407
Turn up the airconditioning.

188
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:26,677
We can't go back,
we're too far from the house.

189
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,253
Nanny, how could you forget his PSP?

190
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:32,688
lt must've been
in the other bag, Ma'am.

191
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:37,226
Nanny, my PSP!
How could you leave it!

192
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:44,525
Father is in the hospital.

193
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,968
Mother is also ill.

194
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:49,506
Your brother was stabbed.

195
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:52,609
Your youngest sister is pregnant.

196
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:55,236
Your dog is missing.

197
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:57,347
Send money.

198
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:00,747
And cellphone credits. Thanks.

199
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:05,714
l want my PSP!

200
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:08,816
Nanny, make him stop,
he's giving me a headache.

201
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:10,087
Yes, Sir.

202
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:13,891
Let's just read a book.
You'll like this. Moby Dick.

203
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:17,264
Moby Dick? That's cruelty to animals!

204
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:19,496
What do you want?

205
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:22,971
l want my PSP!

206
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:29,140
Here it is, citizens.

207
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:31,215
ln a few moments we will witness
an amazing event.

208
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,578
- lt's time for your meds.
- A solar eclipse!

209
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:34,447
Give them to me.

210
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,384
Get your video cameras
and cellphones ready!

211
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:43,621
The next partial solar eclipse
is two years away!

212
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,254
Take care when looking at the eclipse,
you don't want to damage your eyes.

213
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,730
- Give me my sunglasses.
- Why?

214
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:51,535
Didn't you hear the radio?

215
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:57,474
lt's two years
until the next solar eclipse.

216
00:17:57,843 --> 00:17:59,936
l'll probably be ashes by then.

217
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:04,610
- Driver, slow down.
- Sir?

218
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:07,945
Slow down, you devil.

219
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,891
Marvelous!

220
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:24,434
Sisters, what about
the division of labor later?

221
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:26,668
l'll do the bride.

222
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:29,273
JR will do the makeup
of the maid of honor, bridesmaids...

223
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:30,705
and the mother of the bride.

224
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:33,504
You'll do the godmothers
and grandmothers.

225
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:37,237
Are you punishing me?
How many godmothers?

226
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:39,782
- 12, l think.
- 12?

227
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:44,855
ls this a wedding or a fund-raising?

228
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,585
That's why l charged them extra.

229
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:49,125
Anyway the bride is nice...

230
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:52,128
she comes to our salon regularly
for her manicure and pedicure.

231
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:57,234
Beautiful girl, pretty face.
Very kind. Sweet.

232
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:58,927
Kind of dowdy, though.

233
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:03,437
Have you sighted the groom?
ls he hot? A cutie?

234
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:09,345
Harry my love?
Yumminess itself!

235
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,642
There's an over-the-top reaction.

236
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,844
- For real?
- For true!

237
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:19,754
Listen, gays of the year, we're close
to the electromagnetic field area.

238
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:22,986
- Really? ls it nearby?
- Yes.

239
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:26,428
You can turn off the engine
or put it in neutral...

240
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:28,022
and the car will still drive up.

241
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:31,864
- Let's try it!
- Okay, let's try!

242
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:39,139
Mom, are you crying?

243
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:45,673
Didn't you say, no tears?

244
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:52,245
Our makeup will be ruined.
Those beauticians charge so much.

245
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:59,159
Princess, they're not beauticians.
They're image stylists.

246
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:05,401
l just wish your dad were here.

247
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:09,465
l wish he could walk you
down the aisle.

248
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:14,675
Mom, whatever his address
in heaven is...

249
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,310
l know he's happy.

250
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:21,615
Besides, he's with us in spirit.

251
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,816
And we'll walk down
the aisle together.

252
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:29,189
l know, Stef.

253
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:33,397
- So stop crying.
- Okay.

254
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:39,993
l'll stop if you stop
biting your nails.

255
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:43,734
Eww, look at that, they're cracked.

256
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:45,972
What does that word mean?

257
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:51,176
Even if you email me that 18-page
affidavit l can't decide on it.

258
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:53,807
l'm at the beach until late tonight.

259
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:58,548
A beach wedding.
Yes, l am a godmother at a wedding.

260
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,622
Did you think it was a baptism?

261
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:04,888
Are you laughing?
Are you laughing at me?

262
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:09,294
Chubby? Who's Chubby? Hello?

263
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:12,832
My battery's low, wait.

264
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:17,069
Where is my charger?

265
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,939
Let's try this.
Hansel and Gretel.

266
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:24,572
- Once upon a time...
- l don't like that!

267
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:27,276
- lt's disturbing!
- Disturbing...

268
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:30,885
Here, Little Red Riding Hood.

269
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:33,557
- Once upon a time...
- l don't like that!

270
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:35,785
lt's too violent!

271
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:40,022
Now this was my favorite
when l was a child.

272
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:45,068
- The Legend of the Lanzones.
- l don't eat lanzones!

273
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:53,603
l want my PSP!

274
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,018
Sir, you might get sideswiped.

275
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,143
Stop that. Here it comes.

276
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,016
- Sir...
- Wait a second.

277
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:08,752
- You might get caught on something.
- Here comes the total eclipse!

278
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:12,794
lt's beautiful!

279
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:22,931
- How does this go?
- Turn off the engine.

280
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:27,938
- Put it in neutral.
- lt's in neutral.

281
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:35,985
- This is great!
- Such fun!

282
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:38,022
lt's because we have
electromagnetic personalities...

283
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:40,120
unlike certain people in this car.

284
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:42,060
Correct!

285
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:45,223
Big freaking deal.

286
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:47,558
ls this your first time
to experience a magnet?

287
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:50,396
Don't you have refrigerators at home?

288
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:55,267
- ls that it?
- Kind of.

289
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:59,008
So, what? That's that?

290
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:03,812
Aaaah!

291
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:07,680
- You're so cheap.
- Killjoy!

292
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:30,902
All of a sudden,
in a blink of an eye...

293
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:33,543
in the middle
of the national highway...

294
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:39,207
at the center of the magnetic field
and temporary darkness...

295
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:40,784
the five of us-

296
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:46,553
Ninang Precy,
yours truly, the beautician...

297
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:50,627
l mean the image stylist Toffee,
Grandfather Bien...

298
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:54,926
and the Nanny temporarily
lost consciousness.

299
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,625
- Nanny!
- Medelyn...

300
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,430
Nanny!

301
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:01,396
Dad, go get water for Nanny.

302
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:05,067
- lñaki, get water for Nanny.
- Why me?

303
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:08,668
Medelyn, are you okay?

304
00:24:19,891 --> 00:24:22,860
Where am l? Who are you?

305
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,092
State your full names for the record.

306
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:27,891
Dad, maybe we should call a doctor.

307
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:30,129
She's probably just nuts from hunger.

308
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:32,033
Medelyn, have you eaten?

309
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:34,468
Am l dead? What happened?

310
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:37,572
There was an accident.
A minor one.

311
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:39,905
Maybe it's whiplash.

312
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:42,206
Oh my gosh.

313
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:45,081
- Dad, get water!
- lñaki, get water!

314
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:01,964
Nanny, you're so weird.

315
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:09,440
Why don't you call a doctor
just to be sure?

316
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:12,839
Dad's doctor is in France
attending a conference.

317
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:14,969
- Weren't you listening?
- Then call any doctor?

318
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,138
Any doctor?

319
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:18,044
Dad has a complicated
medical history.

320
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:20,014
Not that you would know,
you don't care about him.

321
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:21,618
Don't you start with me.

322
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:24,121
His blood pressure is normal.

323
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:26,622
Then why isn't he speaking?
He might've had a stroke.

324
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:30,194
Why don't we try asking him?

325
00:25:30,328 --> 00:25:33,195
Mister Bien, are you alright?

326
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:36,297
Would you like to return to Manila?

327
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:41,102
Are you in pain?
We could take you to a hospital.

328
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:47,007
lt's okay, Sir. l feel fine.

329
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:50,572
You don't have to take me
to the hospital.

330
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:56,282
When did Dad learn to speak Bisaya?

331
00:25:57,022 --> 00:26:00,685
- Not Bisaya, llonggo.
- Whatever.

332
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:12,903
Ha!

333
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:50,969
The other one's awake.
Maybe someone can do my makeup now?

334
00:26:51,476 --> 00:26:55,708
Sorry, Ma'am, l'll call him.
Patience.

335
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:02,486
Hey, are you okay?
Can you start working?

336
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:05,117
Could you do the makeup
of the other godmothers?

337
00:27:05,223 --> 00:27:08,590
That's your assignment, remember?

338
00:27:13,698 --> 00:27:19,796
Miss Catatonia, did you hear me?
You fag.

339
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:21,364
Who are you calling fag?

340
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:25,342
Straighten up.

341
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:28,502
You shake your hips like a woman.

342
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:31,214
Shameless hussy!

343
00:27:32,717 --> 00:27:35,709
Wow, a Best Actress performance!

344
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,220
Hey! You look like a tomboy!

345
00:27:38,356 --> 00:27:41,086
Get out here
or l'll never give you a job again.

346
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:43,691
Since when do you speak Spanish?

347
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:09,751
- Where is that fag going?
- Where else?

348
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:12,782
Our work is here,
and he's wandering off.

349
00:28:59,804 --> 00:29:01,066
Best friend?

350
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:06,007
- Mom?
- Mom?

351
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:09,473
Are you okay, Best friend?

352
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,109
Doctor, what drugs did you give her?

353
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,945
Nothing hardcore.

354
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:19,722
My dear, are you hallucinating?

355
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:22,656
Shall l have the driver
bring you to Manila?

356
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:25,096
St. Luke's Hospital
or Makati Medical?

357
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:27,724
- Mom...
- Dear...

358
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:32,227
- Why do you call me Mom?
- Because you are my mom.

359
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:36,404
Precy, you're freaking me out.

360
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:40,567
Mom, l'm the one who's like
totally freaked out here.

361
00:29:40,678 --> 00:29:43,374
- l'm your daughter.
- Excuse me?

362
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:46,448
l'm too young to be your mother.

363
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:50,076
But l'm Stephanie.
Your daughter.

364
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:53,748
- What's the matter with you?
- The matter with me?

365
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:56,185
What is the matter with you?

366
00:29:56,594 --> 00:29:59,995
Best friend, have a little dignity.

367
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:05,000
l don't know if you're on drugs
or playing a trick on me...

368
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:08,070
but you are definitely
not yourself today.

369
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:10,600
Wait, where are you going?

370
00:30:10,775 --> 00:30:14,802
Mom, l have a wedding to catch!
My own wedding, duh.

371
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:16,846
You're not leaving this room.

372
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:20,041
You're not going to ruin
my daughter's most important day.

373
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:22,549
But l am your daughter.

374
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:30,457
Precy, you are having
a nervous breakdown.

375
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:32,793
lf you're depressed or destructive...

376
00:30:32,897 --> 00:30:34,956
because you have a concussion
from the accident...

377
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:38,567
please stay away from my daughter.

378
00:30:38,703 --> 00:30:42,730
- But l am your daughter.
- Lunatic!

379
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:48,602
Doctor, nurses, no matter what happens
she must not leave this room.

380
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:53,342
Let me go! Mom, they're hurting me.

381
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:57,579
Precy, stay here.
Don't make me call the police.

382
00:30:57,956 --> 00:31:00,322
But it's my wedding day!

383
00:31:01,826 --> 00:31:03,316
You're pathetic.

384
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:08,394
Doctor, medicate her.
l don't care if she's out for a week.

385
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:11,866
Mom, don't leave me,
it's my wedding day!

386
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:24,877
Thank you so much for this face,
this body, this flower.

387
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:28,118
l am a woman now!

388
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:37,928
l don't know why l've been blessed,
but l know this beauty has a purpose.

389
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:46,900
And if l'm dreaming, please God,
don't wake me up.

390
00:31:47,872 --> 00:31:50,841
That's all. Thank you!

391
00:31:54,712 --> 00:31:58,580
This beauty is insane!

392
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:03,117
Gorgeousness from every angle!

393
00:32:03,688 --> 00:32:12,460
Eyes, nose, lips, cleavage, armpits.

394
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:15,225
The butt's a little small,
but l'll manage.

395
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:19,832
l'm so sexy! Can l handle it?

396
00:32:20,738 --> 00:32:24,936
Yes. Yes! l deserve this.

397
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:28,677
l so deserve this!

398
00:32:28,813 --> 00:32:30,212
ls everything ready?

399
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:33,317
Yes, Ma'am, everything
will be ready by sunset.

400
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:34,509
The wedding cake?

401
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:36,414
That's the only thing
we're waiting for.

402
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:39,648
Don't worry, l've talked
to the supplier.

403
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:43,292
How is godmother Precy?
ls she okay?

404
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:45,453
No, she's far from okay.

405
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:48,229
Really? Will we need a proxy?

406
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:51,630
Wait. Can you alert
all the security guards...

407
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:54,567
not to let her in here
under any circumstances?

408
00:32:54,672 --> 00:32:57,470
- What?
- Can you just do what l say?

409
00:32:58,543 --> 00:33:03,310
Noted, Ma'am. By the way,
the videographers are here.

410
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:05,848
They'd like to take a video
of you and Stephanie.

411
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,413
- Okay. There?
- Yes, Ma'am.

412
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:17,093
- Are the tables ready?
- Yes, Ma'am.

413
00:33:54,732 --> 00:33:56,825
Princess, you want it more tame?

414
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:59,995
No, Mother, here it is!

415
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:05,842
How are you,
is your neck still painful?

416
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:10,074
lt's all in the past, Mother,
l'm ready for my close-up.

417
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:17,211
Your godmother Precy
won't be coming to the wedding.

418
00:34:17,288 --> 00:34:21,884
What? My entourage
won't be complete. Why?

419
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:27,391
She can't come to
the wedding in her condition.

420
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:31,998
She's not herself, it's almost creepy.

421
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,867
lt's like she's possessed.

422
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:37,374
l didn't want to tell you,
you might worry.

423
00:34:37,442 --> 00:34:39,273
Forget that. Spill it, Mother.

424
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:41,937
One more shot. Smile.

425
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,041
Spill?

426
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:48,244
Yes, make like a talk show.

427
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:55,617
Okay. Precy claims that she's you.

428
00:34:56,527 --> 00:34:58,154
Really?

429
00:34:58,229 --> 00:35:02,962
Yes, she says she's the bride
and it's her wedding day.

430
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:04,399
And she says it with conviction.

431
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:08,635
She insists on coming here to be
married, can you believe that?

432
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:12,139
That's crazy!
She might ruin my wedding.

433
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:17,705
Don't worry,
she can't leave the hospital.

434
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:23,420
But Princess, l feel bad for my friend.

435
00:35:24,088 --> 00:35:26,921
l knew that deep down
she's really depressed.

436
00:35:26,991 --> 00:35:29,391
You know,
being all alone in the world.

437
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:33,391
After the wedding
l'm taking her to Manila...

438
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,762
to have her checked by a specialist.

439
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:38,131
- ls that alright?
- Whatever.

440
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,064
Okay.

441
00:35:41,939 --> 00:35:43,372
Don't worry.

442
00:35:44,275 --> 00:35:45,742
One more shot.

443
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:54,651
Nanny, what else
have you forgotten today?

444
00:35:54,719 --> 00:36:00,089
You're such an incompetent fool.

445
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:05,255
- Useless!
- Silence in the court!

446
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:09,496
You shut up when l tell you to shut up!

447
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:12,333
l don't know how
your parents raised you...

448
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:14,564
but l will not stand
for this abusive behavior.

449
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:17,434
From now on you will only speak
when spoken to.

450
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:20,636
You will respect all adults
and stop acting like one.

451
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:26,045
You will say ''please'', ''sir'',
''ma'am''. Understand?

452
00:36:27,818 --> 00:36:29,342
Understand!

453
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,012
Yes, Ma'am.

454
00:36:31,622 --> 00:36:32,646
Good.

455
00:36:33,257 --> 00:36:35,521
l'm telling Mom what you said, Ma'am!

456
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:39,024
Then tell her! l'll see you in court.

457
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:46,900
Well? Have you decided?

458
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,635
What are you talking about?

459
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:54,737
Our plan, remember.
l hope you've decided.

460
00:36:55,613 --> 00:36:58,173
Tonight, when they're asleep.

461
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,519
Don't leave me hanging.

462
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:17,862
Where are the bridesmaids
so we can photograph them?

463
00:37:18,336 --> 00:37:20,361
l'll take you to their room.

464
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:25,842
Princess, l'll guide the videographers,
then l'll check on the cake.

465
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,674
Put some ice on your neck, okay?

466
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:34,810
Mom, stop treating me
like a helpless chick, go! Fly!

467
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:39,413
Okay. You need to get your makeup
done, l'll send the stylist.

468
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:57,469
Get ready for me,
world, here l come.

469
00:37:57,541 --> 00:38:00,135
You're about
to experience total hotness.

470
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:06,014
Sir, stay here and take some air.

471
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:09,612
- l'll prepare your outfit.
- Alright.

472
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:38,212
Excuse me, old man. Are you okay?

473
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:50,223
Nanny! Nanny!

474
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:54,192
What is wrong with you?
You made the boy cry again.

475
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:56,233
You're always screwing up.

476
00:38:56,300 --> 00:39:02,239
You forgot the PSP, the inflatable raft,
the steam iron last week.

477
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:06,943
Just pay up your cash advances...

478
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:11,105
pack your things and
go back where you came from!

479
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:15,678
Madame, can you briefly describe
my job description here?

480
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:19,084
Let me rephrase the question.

481
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,715
What is my job exactly?

482
00:39:22,626 --> 00:39:26,653
Can you state for the record that l am
a nanny and not a child psychiatrist?

483
00:39:27,064 --> 00:39:28,895
Let me call your attention
to provisions in the Labor Code...

484
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:32,628
concerning all persons rendering service
in the household for compensation.

485
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:36,537
Article 1 45: assignment
to non-household work.

486
00:39:36,607 --> 00:39:39,508
No house helper shall be
assigned to any work...

487
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:41,943
commercial, industrial, or agricultural.

488
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:47,075
Furthermore, no household help
shall be assigned to discipline...

489
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:49,346
and teach your child good manners
and right conduct.

490
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:57,327
lt is the parents' obligation
to instill values in their children.

491
00:39:58,028 --> 00:40:02,397
As to your accusation that l am an unfit
nanny for your badly-behaving child...

492
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:07,569
let me state for the record that you
are unfit, unreliable and irresponsible.

493
00:40:07,638 --> 00:40:09,799
lsn't that correct, Missus?
Yes or no?

494
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:13,642
- Yes or no?
- Yes!

495
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:19,308
l rest my case. Excuse me.

496
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:28,083
l'm so smart!

497
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:41,033
There! This is it.

498
00:41:13,537 --> 00:41:16,734
Miss Stephanie, it's Alfie, are you ready
to have your makeup done?

499
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:21,669
Appear, appear, appear!
No need for makeup here!

500
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:28,651
Just a spritz here and there,
throw your eyebrows in the air!

501
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:31,221
Why are you dressed like that?

502
00:41:31,288 --> 00:41:34,746
Why? Are you mesmerized
by my gorgeousness?

503
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:39,228
You're envious aren't you?
l have achieved perfection.

504
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:41,793
Here, help me with this.

505
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:46,625
Careful with the hair.
The hair is top priority.

506
00:41:49,306 --> 00:41:50,864
Where are you going?

507
00:41:50,941 --> 00:41:53,171
To the beach, where the boys are.

508
00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:54,609
But we're running late...

509
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:56,976
Never mind that.
What about your makeup?

510
00:41:57,214 --> 00:41:59,205
Go! There!

511
00:41:59,783 --> 00:42:00,579
Stephanie?

512
00:42:01,418 --> 00:42:02,612
Stephanie, child.

513
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:08,914
This is insane. A blast from the past.

514
00:42:10,494 --> 00:42:12,553
Stephanie, is that you?

515
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:16,760
Uh... yeah.

516
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:24,770
This is your Grandpa Bien.
Harold's grandfather.

517
00:42:24,842 --> 00:42:26,104
Oh?

518
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:32,773
l know this is hard to believe,
but you must listen to me.

519
00:42:33,584 --> 00:42:39,352
l don't know how l ended up
in this body. l'm confused.

520
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:42,152
Okay.

521
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:44,293
Can you help me?

522
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:49,230
Of course. We'll discuss it. Here.

523
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,492
- Where?
- We'll talk. Here.

524
00:42:53,971 --> 00:43:02,174
Here. Yes.
There.

525
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:06,808
Blasted pest!
lnterfering with my plans.

526
00:43:08,352 --> 00:43:12,413
Where have you been?
We have so many clients to do.

527
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:16,717
Were you picking up boys on the beach?
You have a job to do.

528
00:43:16,794 --> 00:43:21,128
- Toffee, do me first.
- Excuse me, l got here first.

529
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:27,196
Excuse me,
l'm the maid of honor and l go first.

530
00:43:33,243 --> 00:43:37,976
Where are you going?
Do the bridesmaids.

531
00:44:03,607 --> 00:44:11,309
- What's up, boys? Got a drink for me?
- Come on, guys, a drink for Stef.

532
00:44:13,017 --> 00:44:14,450
Quick!

533
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:23,758
Why don't we dance? Let's party.

534
00:44:29,233 --> 00:44:30,860
Party!

535
00:44:33,203 --> 00:44:38,835
That's what l like!
We're on the beach, we're so happy.

536
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,996
So. Are you my first victim?

537
00:45:00,064 --> 00:45:03,329
Yes. And hopefully your last.

538
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:09,635
Those are fighting words.
l may bite you.

539
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:16,070
Just say ''Yes, l do''
and l'm yours forever.

540
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:24,920
Oh my god. Forever is a dangerous word.
Won't you get tired of me?

541
00:45:24,988 --> 00:45:28,890
Me get tired of you? lmpossible.

542
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:36,264
So where to? Your place or mine?

543
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:39,733
Are you serious? Now?

544
00:45:39,803 --> 00:45:45,708
Yes. Life is short. And you are so hot.

545
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:51,441
Then again, that's where
we're headed. Why wait.

546
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:54,975
Let's go!
We can have seconds and thirds.

547
00:45:57,788 --> 00:45:59,585
Hi.

548
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:01,584
Hello, child.

549
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:04,660
l'd like a fresh look.

550
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:07,622
Fresh?

551
00:46:07,698 --> 00:46:11,657
The no makeup look. You know.

552
00:46:13,837 --> 00:46:15,361
Alright, let's try that.

553
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:21,639
But highlights on the cheekbones
and nose, and a bit of blusher. Thanks.

554
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:41,628
Here.

555
00:46:42,032 --> 00:46:50,462
- Look at that. What a hunk.
- What are you doing, Stef?

556
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:57,674
- You're making me crazy.
- Stef, what are you doing?

557
00:46:59,249 --> 00:47:03,686
Delicious.

558
00:47:07,724 --> 00:47:11,455
Babe, Stef, are you sure
you want to do this?

559
00:47:11,528 --> 00:47:13,120
Yes! Absolutely!

560
00:47:13,197 --> 00:47:15,893
- ls that your final answer?
- Yes, is that your final question?

561
00:47:15,966 --> 00:47:18,264
Stef.

562
00:47:18,769 --> 00:47:22,500
- Come on, let's go.
- Stef, this isn't right.

563
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:25,474
What do you mean it's not right?
Don't be so fussy.

564
00:47:25,542 --> 00:47:28,170
- Stef.
- l need to make my quota, hurry.

565
00:47:28,245 --> 00:47:30,475
But didn't you say you wanted
our first time to be special?

566
00:47:30,647 --> 00:47:34,583
What! l said no such thing! Come on!

567
00:47:34,651 --> 00:47:37,017
Stef, we held back for 4 years.

568
00:47:37,821 --> 00:47:40,483
4 years? l refrained for 4 years?

569
00:47:40,657 --> 00:47:43,057
Let's not break our oath now.

570
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:46,687
What oath?
l have not signed any contract.

571
00:47:46,763 --> 00:47:48,993
We made a pact, Stef.

572
00:47:49,733 --> 00:47:52,793
We would do this the right way.
We would wait until we were married.

573
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:55,604
Married? Us?

574
00:47:55,672 --> 00:48:01,110
Yes, us.
You, me, here, later.

575
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:06,573
Later? Here? You, me? Us?

576
00:48:07,417 --> 00:48:11,979
My wife is so cute.
You never fail to surprise me.

577
00:48:12,856 --> 00:48:18,294
l promise to take care of you,
to cherish you forever...

578
00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:22,026
to make you happy
every single moment of your life.

579
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,262
l love you.

580
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:33,505
Such things exist?

581
00:48:35,779 --> 00:48:39,943
Besides, it's just a few hours.
When the sun sets, we're legal.

582
00:48:40,617 --> 00:48:41,845
See you later, Babe.

583
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:46,015
l'll be getting ready. You too, okay?

584
00:48:47,224 --> 00:48:49,249
Catch you later, wifey.

585
00:48:55,098 --> 00:49:02,231
l'm so fabulous! My God!

586
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:04,172
There.

587
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:14,383
What have you done? You jerk!

588
00:49:15,919 --> 00:49:20,117
My apologies!
l didn't know what l was doing.

589
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:22,351
lsn't that the fashion today?

590
00:49:22,426 --> 00:49:24,189
You look like a mascot.

591
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:26,728
This is a wedding,
not a children's party.

592
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:29,527
You didn't become beautiful,
you just got colorful.

593
00:49:29,733 --> 00:49:31,701
You look like a fool.

594
00:49:38,108 --> 00:49:43,910
You nitwit! What have you done!

595
00:49:48,919 --> 00:49:49,749
Sit down!

596
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,381
Wait for me, lady.

597
00:50:01,598 --> 00:50:03,998
Stop! Come back here!

598
00:50:18,715 --> 00:50:22,583
Miss, where are you going?
You can't leave.

599
00:50:22,652 --> 00:50:28,818
Nurse, l have a wedding to catch.
My very own. Can't you understand?

600
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,455
Man, she's really stoned.

601
00:50:32,729 --> 00:50:33,991
l heard she's super-smart...

602
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:37,567
that's how she lost her mind.
Poor thing.

603
00:50:37,634 --> 00:50:42,196
Why am l in a straitjacket?
lsn't this for crazy people?

604
00:50:42,272 --> 00:50:48,302
Do l look like a crazy person?
Tell me.

605
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:52,906
The doctor says
you're a threat to human life.

606
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:55,042
To yourself and others.

607
00:50:55,118 --> 00:50:59,077
Believe me, l'm not crazy.

608
00:50:59,823 --> 00:51:08,322
You can't lock me up,
l'm getting married!

609
00:51:11,101 --> 00:51:14,502
Dad, here's the check for the resort
and for the wedding package.

610
00:51:19,042 --> 00:51:22,637
1 .5 million pesos?
This is the price of a condo!

611
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:25,613
l am not talking to you.

612
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:34,187
Dad, this includes all expenses,
including guest lodgings. Sign it, Dad.

613
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:39,222
lt's the wedding of Harold,
your first grandchild.

614
00:51:39,329 --> 00:51:41,763
Dad, don't tell me you're signing that.
