1
00:00:56,756 --> 00:00:58,336
- Sorry.
- It's OK.

2
00:01:00,376 --> 00:01:02,126
What do you want to know?

3
00:01:04,006 --> 00:01:06,336
Just a sec, it hasn't recorded.

4
00:01:09,716 --> 00:01:10,796
There.

5
00:01:12,066 --> 00:01:15,526
So, the way you describe
the son's accident...

6
00:01:16,126 --> 00:01:19,006
It's troubling to read
because we know it's your life.

7
00:01:19,176 --> 00:01:21,586
Do you think one can only
write from experience?

8
00:01:29,926 --> 00:01:31,626
Come. Jump!

9
00:01:32,506 --> 00:01:33,876
Jump!

10
00:01:34,336 --> 00:01:36,046
Jump. C'mon!

11
00:01:37,906 --> 00:01:39,576
Jump! Jump!

12
00:01:40,546 --> 00:01:43,256
It leads me
to an interesting story,

13
00:01:43,426 --> 00:01:46,216
and I decide to put you
in the book I'm writing.

14
00:01:46,376 --> 00:01:48,376
It's not more. You're in my book.

15
00:01:48,986 --> 00:01:50,606
And yet, I don't know you.

16
00:01:51,426 --> 00:01:53,796
What I do know about
is my interest in you.

17
00:01:53,966 --> 00:01:56,426
But still, you had to meet me first.

18
00:01:56,836 --> 00:01:59,466
I'm real, in front of you now.

19
00:01:59,876 --> 00:02:01,546
Yes, that you are.

20
00:02:01,876 --> 00:02:04,086
Yeah, so, for you to start inventing,

21
00:02:04,256 --> 00:02:06,086
you need something real first.

22
00:02:06,296 --> 00:02:08,466
You say your books
always mix truth and fiction.

23
00:02:08,626 --> 00:02:11,336
That makes us want
to figure out which is which.

24
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:13,296
Is that your goal?

25
00:02:18,256 --> 00:02:19,586
OK, get out.

26
00:02:23,996 --> 00:02:25,156
Snoop, come!

27
00:02:26,676 --> 00:02:29,046
Let's dry you off.
You're nice and clean.

28
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:30,466
No more dirt.

29
00:02:37,046 --> 00:02:38,836
What would you write about?

30
00:02:39,466 --> 00:02:42,216
It's Samuel working upstairs.
My husband.

31
00:02:45,046 --> 00:02:47,426
So, what interests you?

32
00:02:47,586 --> 00:02:49,926
What makes you so mad
you want to explode?

33
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:52,426
Forget about your thesis,
your studies.

34
00:02:52,626 --> 00:02:54,376
I don't want to be a writer.

35
00:02:54,546 --> 00:02:57,966
That's OK, you don't have to write,
just talk, like we're talking now.

36
00:02:58,126 --> 00:03:00,126
You don't want to go on
with my questions?

37
00:03:00,296 --> 00:03:03,966
Of course I do.
But we could chat too.

38
00:03:04,466 --> 00:03:06,506
Maybe we ask one question each,

39
00:03:06,676 --> 00:03:10,426
so nobody's frustrated,
like a normal conversation.

40
00:03:11,626 --> 00:03:13,506
Are you really interested in...

41
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:16,256
What interests you?
Come on, sure.

42
00:03:16,926 --> 00:03:19,346
I never see anybody,
I work here all day long,

43
00:03:19,446 --> 00:03:21,506
you come to see me,
of course you interest me.

44
00:03:25,776 --> 00:03:26,866
I run.

45
00:03:27,326 --> 00:03:29,696
It's one of my favorite things to do.

46
00:03:29,866 --> 00:03:32,116
Makes me feel high,
like I'm on drugs.

47
00:03:33,486 --> 00:03:36,156
What do you know about drugs?

48
00:03:36,376 --> 00:03:37,756
That's the next question.

49
00:03:38,196 --> 00:03:39,486
Big subject.

50
00:03:40,406 --> 00:03:42,616
Maybe don't write everything down.

51
00:03:42,776 --> 00:03:44,116
Surely not.

52
00:03:52,906 --> 00:03:56,526
I told you,
we should have done this in Grenoble.

53
00:03:57,196 --> 00:03:59,826
It's fine.
I'll write your answers down.

54
00:04:00,026 --> 00:04:03,826
But I have many questions.
Maybe you don't have the time.

55
00:04:04,406 --> 00:04:07,826
Don't worry about time,
time is not the problem here.

56
00:04:08,326 --> 00:04:09,326
OK. Cool.

57
00:04:09,446 --> 00:04:11,446
I'd like to discuss storytelling...

58
00:04:11,656 --> 00:04:13,196
I don't like sports.

59
00:04:13,366 --> 00:04:14,616
That's the first thing.

60
00:04:14,776 --> 00:04:17,776
Walking yes, maybe.
Running, no!

61
00:04:18,446 --> 00:04:20,116
OK, right, I get it.

62
00:04:21,116 --> 00:04:22,116
So,

63
00:04:23,076 --> 00:04:24,236
you're...

64
00:04:33,276 --> 00:04:35,406
It's not really possible anymore,
is it?

65
00:04:35,576 --> 00:04:36,986
Yes, it's complicated.

66
00:04:37,156 --> 00:04:39,236
I think we have to stop, Zoé.

67
00:04:42,906 --> 00:04:46,076
I'll be in Grenoble soon,
I'll give you a call.

68
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:54,406
Sorry about that.

69
00:04:58,526 --> 00:05:00,406
- See you soon.
- Yes, for sure.

70
00:06:54,446 --> 00:06:55,576
Careful.

71
00:07:33,526 --> 00:07:34,526
Dad...

72
00:07:34,576 --> 00:07:35,616
Mom!

73
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:37,616
Mom!

74
00:07:42,326 --> 00:07:43,616
Mom, come quick!

75
00:08:29,326 --> 00:08:30,366
Yes...

76
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:32,156
No, I don't know.

77
00:08:32,326 --> 00:08:35,026
I didn't move him,
I didn't touch him at all.

78
00:08:35,656 --> 00:08:38,156
He's not breathing,
that's why I'm calling.

79
00:08:40,076 --> 00:08:43,116
No, please come,
I can't answer all the questions.

80
00:08:46,116 --> 00:08:49,116
No, he's not moving.
Please just come.

81
00:08:58,326 --> 00:08:59,946
Samuel Maleski,

82
00:09:00,116 --> 00:09:02,366
found dead below his chalet...

83
00:09:34,826 --> 00:09:36,406
Turning him now.

84
00:09:39,986 --> 00:09:41,236
Full shot.

85
00:09:42,366 --> 00:09:43,656
Close up.

86
00:09:46,326 --> 00:09:48,236
I'll dictate the initial ideas.

87
00:09:48,406 --> 00:09:51,076
Insert them before the conclusion.

88
00:09:51,406 --> 00:09:55,236
The parallel, superficial abrasions
on the hands and forearms

89
00:09:55,406 --> 00:09:58,276
suggest the body slid
1 or 2 meters upon impact

90
00:09:58,486 --> 00:10:01,526
before reaching
its final, supine position.

91
00:10:02,366 --> 00:10:05,986
A left temporal hematoma
related to the fatal brain trauma

92
00:10:06,156 --> 00:10:09,906
indicates collision with
a blunt object in the environment

93
00:10:10,126 --> 00:10:12,506
or a violent blow to the head.

94
00:10:13,526 --> 00:10:16,986
Injury location is inconsistent
with discovery position,

95
00:10:17,156 --> 00:10:20,826
thus impact occurred
before the body hit the ground.

96
00:10:22,616 --> 00:10:24,736
In conclusion,
we cannot yet determine

97
00:10:24,906 --> 00:10:28,276
if the injury resulted
from a collision or a blow.

98
00:10:28,616 --> 00:10:32,986
We cannot, at this stage,
rule out third party involvement.

99
00:10:35,076 --> 00:10:36,866
Then, the usual.

100
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:39,276
CAUSE OF DEATH: HEAD TRAUMA.

101
00:10:39,446 --> 00:10:41,276
FORENSIC CAUSE:

102
00:10:41,656 --> 00:10:43,946
ACCIDENTAL AND/OR DELIBERATE.

103
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:48,506
Toxicological analysis needed
to establish the truth.

104
00:11:52,576 --> 00:11:58,326
Anatomy of a fall.

105
00:12:40,276 --> 00:12:41,576
Thank you for coming.

106
00:12:43,156 --> 00:12:45,196
It's really weird,
seeing you again like this.

107
00:12:45,366 --> 00:12:46,446
- It is.
- OK.

108
00:12:49,076 --> 00:12:52,026
I didn't realize it was so high.

109
00:12:52,526 --> 00:12:53,906
Yeah.

110
00:12:54,656 --> 00:12:55,826
Come.

111
00:13:00,236 --> 00:13:02,656
Have you lived here long?

112
00:13:03,276 --> 00:13:05,656
Less than two years.

113
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:08,736
Samuel grew up here.

114
00:13:08,906 --> 00:13:10,156
It's his...

115
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:17,446
Well...

116
00:13:21,616 --> 00:13:26,276
How are we gonna do this?
Will you ask me some questions...

117
00:13:26,696 --> 00:13:30,276
I'm really sorry my French
isn't any better than when we met.

118
00:13:30,446 --> 00:13:31,946
- No. English is fine.
- OK.

119
00:13:36,276 --> 00:13:38,276
How many times
have you been questioned?

120
00:13:38,946 --> 00:13:42,026
It's been once here,
by the policemen,

121
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:44,736
and once
by the investigative judge.

122
00:13:46,406 --> 00:13:50,236
Can you tell me what you told them
about the day he died?

123
00:13:50,406 --> 00:13:51,406
Yes, of course.

124
00:13:51,466 --> 00:13:54,796
I told them everything,
from when I was with the student

125
00:13:54,946 --> 00:13:56,946
until the ambulance got here.

126
00:13:57,276 --> 00:13:59,736
I was in the middle of a meeting
with this girl,

127
00:13:59,906 --> 00:14:02,406
and Samuel started

128
00:14:02,626 --> 00:14:05,876
blasting a song on repeat
to piss me off and make her leave.

129
00:14:06,026 --> 00:14:08,866
Did you tell them he played
the song to piss you off?

130
00:14:09,026 --> 00:14:10,116
No.

131
00:14:10,756 --> 00:14:14,666
I just said he played the song
super loud and we had to stop.

132
00:14:14,826 --> 00:14:18,156
She was recording the interview
and it wasn't possible anymore.

133
00:14:19,576 --> 00:14:22,326
I need you to be precise.

134
00:14:23,076 --> 00:14:26,026
Tell me everything
exactly the way you told them.

135
00:14:26,196 --> 00:14:27,276
Yes.

136
00:14:28,026 --> 00:14:31,576
So. I told them that
I put an end to the interview.

137
00:14:32,576 --> 00:14:33,736
And that she left.

138
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:36,366
And I went upstairs to my bedroom

139
00:14:36,526 --> 00:14:39,576
and that's when I saw Daniel
go out for a walk.

140
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:41,376
He wasn't at school?

141
00:14:41,526 --> 00:14:43,986
No, he only goes
two days a week in Grenoble.

142
00:14:44,366 --> 00:14:45,616
How old is he now?

143
00:14:45,776 --> 00:14:47,076
He's eleven.

144
00:14:48,446 --> 00:14:49,986
And then...

145
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:52,906
So, after the girl left...

146
00:14:54,986 --> 00:14:57,076
Samuel came down
to see me in my bedroom.

147
00:14:57,236 --> 00:15:00,406
We spoke a bit about
what we were going to do that day.

148
00:15:00,576 --> 00:15:02,236
It was nothing special, really.

149
00:15:05,116 --> 00:15:06,276
He...

150
00:15:06,446 --> 00:15:10,076
He went back upstairs to work
in the attic and I worked in bed.

151
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:13,196
You wrote? On your computer?

152
00:15:13,366 --> 00:15:15,406
Yes, I finished a translation.

153
00:15:15,576 --> 00:15:18,776
I translate for some German weeklies,
for extra money.

154
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:21,116
And then...

155
00:15:22,076 --> 00:15:25,616
Yes. I heard him working upstairs
and playing his music

156
00:15:25,776 --> 00:15:28,406
for about, I think it must've been

157
00:15:28,576 --> 00:15:29,736
ten minutes.

158
00:15:30,116 --> 00:15:33,446
Then I put some earplugs in
because I wanted to take a nap.

159
00:15:34,826 --> 00:15:35,986
And..

160
00:15:36,616 --> 00:15:37,986
I fell asleep.

161
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:42,406
And an hour later, I think,

162
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:45,116
I heard Daniel scream, and then...

163
00:15:48,866 --> 00:15:52,446
An earplug must've fallen out,
because it woke me up.

164
00:15:53,196 --> 00:15:56,326
The music was still on,
I ran downstairs, and...

165
00:15:56,906 --> 00:15:58,026
Yes. That's it.

166
00:15:59,276 --> 00:16:02,026
I called the SAMU
and they arrived 30 minutes later.

167
00:16:12,986 --> 00:16:15,026
- Can I take a look around?
- Of course.

168
00:16:15,196 --> 00:16:16,406
- Yes?
- Yes.

169
00:16:21,026 --> 00:16:25,026
Where do you want to start?
Should I explain... something.

170
00:16:25,196 --> 00:16:26,366
Yeah, maybe.

171
00:16:26,866 --> 00:16:28,326
Yeah. This is where...

172
00:16:28,486 --> 00:16:30,076
This is where we eat.

173
00:16:30,236 --> 00:16:31,946
- Yes, sorry...
- No...

174
00:16:56,236 --> 00:16:57,236
So...

175
00:16:58,156 --> 00:16:59,366
He was working over there?

176
00:16:59,526 --> 00:17:01,486
Yeah, he was insulating the attic.

177
00:17:02,946 --> 00:17:06,116
And when you were having a nap,
he was right above you?

178
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:08,026
- Yes.
- OK.

179
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:19,196
So...

180
00:17:19,366 --> 00:17:21,366
He was supposed to get to that next.

181
00:17:21,526 --> 00:17:23,776
We wanted to make rooms for B&B.

182
00:18:04,076 --> 00:18:06,156
So, he was working there?

183
00:18:06,326 --> 00:18:07,616
These days, yes.

184
00:18:10,446 --> 00:18:12,116
And the window,

185
00:18:12,656 --> 00:18:15,156
when the ambulance arrived,
was it open?

186
00:18:15,366 --> 00:18:16,736
Yes, it was.

187
00:18:18,526 --> 00:18:20,526
He used to keep it open?

188
00:18:21,486 --> 00:18:23,656
I'm not sure of that really, because

189
00:18:23,826 --> 00:18:25,486
sometimes he would air the room

190
00:18:25,656 --> 00:18:27,696
to get rid of the wood dust.

191
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:31,276
Was he reckless?
Did he ever take risks while working?

192
00:18:31,616 --> 00:18:35,526
No, he was cautious and meticulous,
he worked slowly.

193
00:18:44,616 --> 00:18:46,526
Is there any reason why he would've

194
00:18:46,756 --> 00:18:49,706
leaned out the window,
for instance, to call out to you

195
00:18:49,926 --> 00:18:50,716
or Daniel?

196
00:18:50,866 --> 00:18:55,776
No, when he was working, especially when
he was playing his music, he kinda...

197
00:18:57,366 --> 00:18:59,616
he shut himself off from the world.

198
00:18:59,776 --> 00:19:02,326
So, he never called
for me or Daniel up here.

199
00:19:04,196 --> 00:19:06,366
Anyway, with the height of the...

200
00:19:08,236 --> 00:19:09,046
Windowsill?

201
00:19:09,136 --> 00:19:10,836
- Windowsill.
- Yeah.

202
00:19:13,776 --> 00:19:15,156
Had he been drinking?

203
00:19:15,326 --> 00:19:16,616
No, never during the day.

204
00:19:16,846 --> 00:19:18,846
Especially when he was working.

205
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:29,076
Sweetie...

206
00:19:30,326 --> 00:19:33,446
Come wash up and get dressed.
It's daytime, you need to get up.

207
00:19:35,946 --> 00:19:38,616
Honey, I know this is hard.
It's hard for me too.

208
00:19:39,026 --> 00:19:41,236
And it's going to be hard
for a while.

209
00:19:42,576 --> 00:19:46,576
But we have to try and do
the things that we did before...

210
00:19:50,986 --> 00:19:54,026
Monica came to see you,
she made you Tiramisu.

211
00:19:56,986 --> 00:19:59,196
You can't spend all day
without going outside.

212
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:02,236
It's beautiful out.
And Snoop needs to go out too.

213
00:20:10,616 --> 00:20:12,946
Daniel,
will you come eat with us?

214
00:20:13,486 --> 00:20:14,656
I want to sleep.

215
00:20:14,826 --> 00:20:18,406
OK, first eat with us,
then you can sleep.

216
00:20:53,366 --> 00:20:54,866
I don't understand.

217
00:20:56,156 --> 00:20:58,276
No one understands.

218
00:20:58,446 --> 00:21:00,026
We can't understand.

219
00:21:04,986 --> 00:21:06,486
I have to understand.

220
00:21:12,656 --> 00:21:16,076
Remember the psychic
I told you about,

221
00:21:16,236 --> 00:21:18,406
the one I saw when Alain died?

222
00:21:19,576 --> 00:21:20,986
Monica.

223
00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:22,156
I'd like to.

224
00:21:22,236 --> 00:21:24,076
I'd rather you don't...

225
00:21:24,236 --> 00:21:26,236
He helped me a lot.

226
00:21:26,446 --> 00:21:27,736
But he's a child.

227
00:21:28,076 --> 00:21:29,276
Don't confuse things.

228
00:21:29,446 --> 00:21:30,906
I'll discuss it with Monica.

229
00:21:31,076 --> 00:21:33,116
She's helped children before.

230
00:21:36,326 --> 00:21:37,326
Want some?

231
00:21:47,326 --> 00:21:48,946
What do you need?

232
00:21:49,576 --> 00:21:50,946
Nothing, I'm OK.

233
00:21:51,116 --> 00:21:52,326
OK.

234
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:04,526
Your doubts aside, it might help him.

235
00:22:04,696 --> 00:22:07,576
She senses things we can't.

236
00:22:09,326 --> 00:22:10,906
Vincent, an old lawyer friend,

237
00:22:11,076 --> 00:22:13,236
Monica, Daniel's Godmother.

238
00:22:13,406 --> 00:22:14,866
- Hello.
- Hello.

239
00:22:15,026 --> 00:22:17,406
- I'll call you.
- Tell me if he eats.

240
00:22:17,616 --> 00:22:18,616
Yes.

241
00:22:22,776 --> 00:22:24,116
Plates?

242
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:37,616
I'm so tired of crying.

243
00:22:37,776 --> 00:22:39,986
It's really ridiculous,
I'm so exhausted.

244
00:22:41,406 --> 00:22:43,326
- Want Parmesan?
- Yes, it's perfect.

245
00:22:43,486 --> 00:22:46,616
- I don't know where the pepper is.
- Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

246
00:22:49,446 --> 00:22:52,486
So, as you know,
the autopsy report is inconclusive

247
00:22:52,656 --> 00:22:54,196
about the cause of death.

248
00:22:54,576 --> 00:22:58,366
The forensic pathologist
didn't have enough concrete elements.

249
00:22:58,526 --> 00:22:59,696
But...

250
00:23:01,276 --> 00:23:03,026
What we can defend,

251
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:07,006
is a fall from the attic window,
with him...

252
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:10,236
bouncing off the shed roof.

253
00:23:10,466 --> 00:23:13,376
His head may have hit the edge
somewhere around here.

254
00:23:16,026 --> 00:23:17,076
You see?

255
00:23:18,076 --> 00:23:20,326
Then he would have landed
on the ground,

256
00:23:20,486 --> 00:23:21,906
approximately here.

257
00:23:22,326 --> 00:23:26,156
It seems that he found the strength
to crawl one meter or two

258
00:23:26,326 --> 00:23:29,776
before collapsing
in this final position.

259
00:23:29,946 --> 00:23:32,696
That explains
the blood on the snow.

260
00:23:33,446 --> 00:23:34,826
But there are several problems.

261
00:23:34,986 --> 00:23:38,076
First, they found nothing
on the roof, no DNA.

262
00:23:38,636 --> 00:23:42,466
And there's these 3 blood spatters
here on the wall.

263
00:23:43,326 --> 00:23:47,196
It seems it doesn't really match
with the head impact on the roof.

264
00:23:47,756 --> 00:23:50,876
The judge has asked an expert
to clarify this.

265
00:23:51,776 --> 00:23:54,526
When you see this
what do you think?

266
00:23:56,866 --> 00:24:00,406
I don't know,
I'm not a spatter analyst.

267
00:24:01,116 --> 00:24:04,326
But I know a very good one.

268
00:24:04,906 --> 00:24:06,486
I'm going to get her opinion.

269
00:24:19,696 --> 00:24:21,986
There's one last problem for us,

270
00:24:22,156 --> 00:24:23,616
that bruise on your arm.

271
00:24:25,236 --> 00:24:28,866
It might look like
the result of a fight or struggle.

272
00:24:31,026 --> 00:24:32,236
When did they see it?

273
00:24:32,386 --> 00:24:35,796
They examined me that night,
my sleeve was rolled up.

274
00:24:35,946 --> 00:24:37,986
You explained it to them right away?

275
00:24:38,156 --> 00:24:39,906
I knew how it happened.
Shall I show you?

276
00:24:40,076 --> 00:24:41,366
Yes, please.

277
00:24:42,326 --> 00:24:45,486
Here in the kitchen,
I bang my arm on this all the time.

278
00:24:45,826 --> 00:24:47,326
Like, when I move.

279
00:24:47,826 --> 00:24:51,366
It's ridiculous, it happened
several times that week.

280
00:24:51,526 --> 00:24:53,736
I told them my skin marks easily

281
00:24:53,906 --> 00:24:56,446
and they can ask Daniel.
He hears me bumping into it.

282
00:24:57,196 --> 00:24:58,486
OK. Good.

283
00:25:02,736 --> 00:25:06,366
So. As you can see, an accidental
fall will be hard to defend,

284
00:25:06,526 --> 00:25:09,696
given the height of the windowsill.

285
00:25:10,026 --> 00:25:13,076
So that's why
there's an investigation for...

286
00:25:13,616 --> 00:25:14,946
more suspects.

287
00:25:15,656 --> 00:25:16,946
And you're...

288
00:25:17,116 --> 00:25:19,076
more "Suspicious death".

289
00:25:19,296 --> 00:25:22,126
You're an assisted witness because
you were the only person there.

290
00:25:22,276 --> 00:25:23,406
OK.

291
00:25:23,736 --> 00:25:25,526
And of course, you're his wife.

292
00:25:27,366 --> 00:25:29,406
Now, looking for
a stranger who walks in,

293
00:25:29,576 --> 00:25:33,616
kills him while you were sleeping
and Daniel was out for a walk

294
00:25:33,776 --> 00:25:35,446
is a shitty strategy.

295
00:25:35,616 --> 00:25:37,276
Samuel had no enemies.

296
00:25:37,446 --> 00:25:38,696
Stop!

297
00:25:39,076 --> 00:25:40,486
I did not kill him.

298
00:25:44,736 --> 00:25:46,236
That's not the point.

299
00:25:46,866 --> 00:25:48,026
Really.

300
00:25:50,576 --> 00:25:54,076
We have to go through
Samuel's personality.

301
00:25:54,736 --> 00:25:56,156
What was he was going through?

302
00:25:58,156 --> 00:26:01,656
Is there anything
that would seem consistent with

303
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:02,946
suicide?

304
00:26:09,116 --> 00:26:10,656
I thought about it, obviously.

305
00:26:10,826 --> 00:26:13,736
I just can't imagine him jumping
with Daniel so close by.

306
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:16,906
I just can't get it in my head.

307
00:26:20,236 --> 00:26:22,866
Yeah, but it's probably
our best defense.

308
00:26:23,026 --> 00:26:25,196
I mean, if they indict you,

309
00:26:25,826 --> 00:26:27,236
it's our only defense.

310
00:26:28,236 --> 00:26:29,986
But I think he fell.

311
00:26:31,776 --> 00:26:33,616
Nobody's going to believe that.

312
00:26:35,276 --> 00:26:36,776
I don't believe that.

313
00:26:39,486 --> 00:26:40,866
I need a smoke.

314
00:27:10,276 --> 00:27:11,326
Vincent.

315
00:27:12,076 --> 00:27:14,826
There's something
I want to tell you.

316
00:27:16,406 --> 00:27:18,076
About six months ago,

317
00:27:18,866 --> 00:27:20,736
I wonder if...

318
00:27:21,116 --> 00:27:23,696
Samuel didn't swallow some pills.

319
00:27:24,076 --> 00:27:27,116
I found him passed out drunk
on the floor.

320
00:27:27,346 --> 00:27:29,546
He'd vomited.
It was very early in the morning.

321
00:27:30,446 --> 00:27:32,446
There were some white spots

322
00:27:32,676 --> 00:27:33,676
in the vomit,

323
00:27:33,776 --> 00:27:37,196
and I remember wondering
if they were pills.

324
00:27:39,026 --> 00:27:40,656
- <i>Really?</i>
- Yes.

325
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:42,826
<i>Did you two talk about it?</i>

326
00:27:42,986 --> 00:27:45,076
No, he didn't want to talk about it.

327
00:27:45,736 --> 00:27:46,826
<i>Did Daniel see this?</i>

328
00:27:46,986 --> 00:27:48,076
No.

329
00:27:48,576 --> 00:27:51,196
<i>And you didn't call a doctor?</i>

330
00:27:51,366 --> 00:27:54,826
No, I didn't realize it back then,
but looking back at it now,

331
00:27:54,986 --> 00:27:58,576
it seems like it might have been
a suicide attempt.

332
00:28:04,276 --> 00:28:05,776
<i>Does anyone know about this?</i>

333
00:28:05,946 --> 00:28:06,986
No.

334
00:28:10,326 --> 00:28:11,616
OK. I'll call you back.

335
00:28:11,776 --> 00:28:12,946
Yes.

336
00:28:13,116 --> 00:28:14,276
- <i>OK.</i>
- Bye.

337
00:29:16,446 --> 00:29:17,866
Is the light too bright?

338
00:29:19,026 --> 00:29:20,986
Want me to lower the blinds?

339
00:29:21,866 --> 00:29:23,196
I'm OK.

340
00:29:23,366 --> 00:29:24,576
Yeah?

341
00:29:24,736 --> 00:29:25,736
OK.

342
00:29:25,776 --> 00:29:29,236
You didn't tell me about
your parents' arguments.

343
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:35,196
What do you mean?
I don't really remember any.

344
00:29:37,326 --> 00:29:41,026
When they start yelling,
I prefer to leave.

345
00:29:41,406 --> 00:29:44,656
Can you tell me who was angrier?

346
00:29:46,026 --> 00:29:47,076
No.

347
00:29:49,946 --> 00:29:53,776
Is that why you left
the day your dad died?

348
00:29:53,946 --> 00:29:56,486
No, I just felt like a walk.

349
00:29:58,116 --> 00:30:01,076
OK. You say you heard
your parents when you left?

350
00:30:01,486 --> 00:30:03,866
Do you remember the conversation?

351
00:30:04,696 --> 00:30:06,986
More or less. It wasn't a fight.

352
00:30:09,326 --> 00:30:12,236
I couldn't hear the words,
but it wasn't...

353
00:30:12,406 --> 00:30:15,076
Then you don't know
it was a fight.

354
00:30:15,236 --> 00:30:18,826
I could tell...
I could hear it wasn't a fight.

355
00:30:19,156 --> 00:30:22,156
Daniel, the music was loud,
you were outside.

356
00:30:22,326 --> 00:30:25,236
They were in her bedroom,
two floors up.

357
00:30:25,616 --> 00:30:27,486
How can you be sure?

358
00:30:27,876 --> 00:30:30,626
I wonder
if you could hear them at all.

359
00:30:30,776 --> 00:30:33,326
I was just below the open window.

360
00:30:33,486 --> 00:30:35,156
I know what I heard.

361
00:30:37,466 --> 00:30:38,546
OK.

362
00:30:44,236 --> 00:30:45,326
Is it over?

363
00:30:46,616 --> 00:30:50,026
How can you be so sure
where you were?

364
00:30:50,486 --> 00:30:52,446
Because I touched the..

365
00:30:52,616 --> 00:30:54,486
Gaffer tape on the woodshed.

366
00:30:55,906 --> 00:30:57,196
Gaffer tape?

367
00:30:57,576 --> 00:30:59,026
When we moved in,

368
00:30:59,256 --> 00:31:02,416
Dad put tape with
different textures everywhere,

369
00:31:02,576 --> 00:31:04,236
- so I could feel my way.
- Yes.

370
00:31:04,986 --> 00:31:08,776
I don't really need them now,
but I still touch them.

371
00:31:08,946 --> 00:31:10,736
Each piece feels different,

372
00:31:10,906 --> 00:31:12,156
I wouldn't get it wrong.

373
00:31:13,406 --> 00:31:15,406
I touched the woodshed tape.

374
00:31:17,196 --> 00:31:18,906
So I was under the window.

375
00:31:19,076 --> 00:31:20,196
OK.

376
00:31:26,406 --> 00:31:28,446
I transposed what you told me.

377
00:31:28,616 --> 00:31:30,496
But I didn't say it in French.

378
00:31:30,656 --> 00:31:32,906
The volume is what matters here,

379
00:31:33,076 --> 00:31:35,616
and French is easier for everyone.

380
00:31:36,446 --> 00:31:38,656
Helene, start the music.

381
00:31:44,776 --> 00:31:45,906
Did it go well?

382
00:31:46,076 --> 00:31:47,986
Yes, nothing special.

383
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:49,776
What's next this afternoon?

384
00:31:49,946 --> 00:31:53,986
I don't know, I'm tired.
I need to work, then I'll rest.

385
00:31:54,196 --> 00:31:55,326
Not asking me?

386
00:31:55,486 --> 00:31:58,326
I assume
you'll keep working in the attic?

387
00:31:59,236 --> 00:32:00,486
Stop the music.

388
00:32:00,866 --> 00:32:01,946
Stop.

389
00:32:02,486 --> 00:32:03,196
So?

390
00:32:03,366 --> 00:32:04,776
Did you hear anything?

391
00:32:06,056 --> 00:32:08,676
Let's go again, louder this time.

392
00:32:09,366 --> 00:32:12,616
Louder? But I didn't shout at all.

393
00:32:12,776 --> 00:32:16,406
The point of the reenactment
is to determine a credible volume.

394
00:32:17,406 --> 00:32:19,076
Vincent, I never shouted.

395
00:32:19,986 --> 00:32:23,656
She spoke no louder.
Her son says the voices were calm.

396
00:32:23,826 --> 00:32:26,826
That doesn't hold up.
The music drowns them out.

397
00:32:27,576 --> 00:32:28,986
My client didn't shout.

398
00:32:29,196 --> 00:32:30,696
She won't shout now.

399
00:32:32,196 --> 00:32:33,196
Miss,

400
00:32:33,366 --> 00:32:35,236
please replace Mrs Voyter.

401
00:32:35,406 --> 00:32:37,866
Come on in, please.

402
00:32:39,446 --> 00:32:40,906
Play the music.

403
00:32:41,076 --> 00:32:42,406
Start the music!

404
00:32:45,076 --> 00:32:46,406
Did it go well?

405
00:32:46,636 --> 00:32:47,966
Yes, nothing special.

406
00:32:48,406 --> 00:32:50,076
What's next this afternoon?

407
00:32:50,236 --> 00:32:52,986
I don't know, I'm tired.
I need to work, then I'll rest.

408
00:33:00,346 --> 00:33:02,176
Go again, much louder.

409
00:33:03,156 --> 00:33:04,196
Was it good?

410
00:33:04,366 --> 00:33:05,906
Yes, nothing special.

411
00:33:06,796 --> 00:33:08,036
What's next this afternoon?

412
00:33:08,116 --> 00:33:11,656
I don't know, I'm tired.
I need to work, then I'll rest.

413
00:33:11,826 --> 00:33:13,656
Not asking me?

414
00:33:13,826 --> 00:33:16,236
I assume
you'll keep working in the attic?

415
00:33:17,236 --> 00:33:18,326
Stop the music.

416
00:33:19,696 --> 00:33:21,196
Now they hear it.

417
00:33:21,366 --> 00:33:22,406
Good.

418
00:33:23,156 --> 00:33:25,196
You do realize that was ridiculous?

419
00:33:25,366 --> 00:33:27,446
Spare me your comments.

420
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:30,626
It was calm voices, not like that.

421
00:33:30,776 --> 00:33:34,156
But see,
you wouldn't have heard them.

422
00:33:36,236 --> 00:33:37,486
Right?

423
00:33:39,946 --> 00:33:43,026
Can we try one last time,
starting inside?

424
00:33:43,366 --> 00:33:45,156
With calm voices again.

425
00:33:47,076 --> 00:33:48,076
We can.

426
00:34:12,906 --> 00:34:14,526
I made a mistake.

427
00:34:14,696 --> 00:34:15,696
Cut the music.

428
00:34:15,736 --> 00:34:18,866
This is the tape I touched.
I was inside.

429
00:34:20,906 --> 00:34:21,986
I got mixed up.

430
00:34:22,156 --> 00:34:23,826
That's not what you told us.

431
00:34:23,986 --> 00:34:27,486
Zoé Solidor saw you
leave the house after she left.

432
00:34:27,656 --> 00:34:30,986
And your mom says
she spoke to your dad after that.

433
00:34:31,446 --> 00:34:32,906
I got mixed up.

434
00:34:33,866 --> 00:34:35,276
You got mixed up.

435
00:34:37,326 --> 00:34:38,526
Well.

436
00:36:24,366 --> 00:36:26,736
This afternoon was hard, wasn't it?

437
00:36:32,906 --> 00:36:34,156
I'm mad at myself.

438
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:38,076
I thought I was sure, and then...

439
00:36:38,406 --> 00:36:40,326
But you didn't lie, did you?

440
00:36:45,116 --> 00:36:47,826
I don't want you
to change your memories.

441
00:36:48,446 --> 00:36:51,486
You have to tell them
exactly like you remember it.

442
00:36:52,446 --> 00:36:53,736
That can never hurt me.

443
00:36:58,696 --> 00:37:00,076
Give me your hand.

444
00:37:02,616 --> 00:37:03,826
Yes.

445
00:37:09,526 --> 00:37:11,026
What do we do now?

446
00:37:13,696 --> 00:37:14,986
You want a drink?

447
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:16,616
Whiskey?

448
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:20,076
Come.

449
00:37:21,986 --> 00:37:23,116
Sorry.

450
00:37:27,446 --> 00:37:28,736
All I can say is,

451
00:37:28,946 --> 00:37:33,526
the interrogation is in progress
and may continue for a while.

452
00:37:33,696 --> 00:37:36,276
She's been in there for 8 hours.

453
00:37:36,446 --> 00:37:38,026
Is she in trouble?

454
00:37:38,406 --> 00:37:40,576
Sandra Voyter is not in trouble.

455
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:42,486
She maintains her innocence,

456
00:37:42,656 --> 00:37:44,576
so there will be no confession.

457
00:37:44,736 --> 00:37:48,116
You're confident,
but we've heard about a recording.

458
00:37:48,276 --> 00:37:49,776
Is it incriminating?

459
00:37:50,326 --> 00:37:52,156
You're not listening.

460
00:37:52,326 --> 00:37:56,446
She has not been indicted,
so nothing is incriminating.

461
00:37:56,616 --> 00:37:58,946
The so-called video is a myth so far.

462
00:37:59,116 --> 00:38:00,986
We've had no access to it.

463
00:38:01,156 --> 00:38:03,576
So, you confirm it's a video?

464
00:38:04,236 --> 00:38:08,156
No, I confirm nothing.
I said precisely the opposite.

465
00:38:08,326 --> 00:38:10,776
If there's nothing new,
why the summons?

466
00:38:10,946 --> 00:38:13,156
I don't know what to tell you.

467
00:38:13,326 --> 00:38:15,906
We don't understand it ourselves.
Thank you.

468
00:38:18,076 --> 00:38:19,276
Thank you for coming

469
00:38:20,406 --> 00:38:22,946
for the public prosecutor's
statement.

470
00:38:24,526 --> 00:38:28,236
So, Sandra Voyter was indicted
this morning at 8:30 a.m.

471
00:38:28,466 --> 00:38:32,756
The investigation revealed elements
that justify this decision.

472
00:38:32,906 --> 00:38:34,446
Three elements in particular.

473
00:38:35,276 --> 00:38:38,486
Analysis of Mr. Maleski's blood spatter

474
00:38:38,656 --> 00:38:41,236
found at the couple's domicile

475
00:38:41,406 --> 00:38:46,076
indicate he may have received
a blunt force blow to the head

476
00:38:46,236 --> 00:38:49,276
when he was
on the third-floor balcony.

477
00:38:49,776 --> 00:38:51,526
In addition,

478
00:38:51,756 --> 00:38:53,796
the reenactment
done three days ago

479
00:38:53,946 --> 00:38:57,236
brought to light
a number of discrepancies.

480
00:38:57,406 --> 00:38:58,576
Lastly,

481
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:03,986
a file was discovered on a USB key
belonging to Mr. Maleski.

482
00:39:04,156 --> 00:39:06,696
All I can say about it, for now,

483
00:39:06,866 --> 00:39:10,116
is that it's an audio recording
of the couple,

484
00:39:10,276 --> 00:39:12,486
made the day before his death.

485
00:39:15,366 --> 00:39:19,156
As I'm trying to tell you,
she can't come sign herself

486
00:39:19,326 --> 00:39:22,736
because she's held up
at the courthouse.

487
00:39:23,196 --> 00:39:25,986
So it'll be me,
her lawyer Vincent Renzi,

488
00:39:26,156 --> 00:39:29,026
coming to get the documents for her.

489
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:31,906
No, I can't come at 11.

490
00:39:32,446 --> 00:39:34,826
I can be there in 20 minutes?

491
00:39:35,826 --> 00:39:38,236
OK. Thanks, be right there.

492
00:39:38,406 --> 00:39:39,736
We have good news.

493
00:39:40,486 --> 00:39:44,026
The judge this afternoon
is not Da Silva, it's Bollène.

494
00:39:44,146 --> 00:39:45,146
OK.

495
00:39:45,576 --> 00:39:46,736
I'm off to the bank.

496
00:39:46,906 --> 00:39:48,696
And the home equity loan?

497
00:39:51,076 --> 00:39:54,656
Less than we hoped.
They have money problems.

498
00:39:54,826 --> 00:39:56,406
Outstanding credit, etc.

499
00:39:56,576 --> 00:39:59,486
The bank will only do 50,000.

500
00:39:59,656 --> 00:40:02,866
Bail will be more than that.

501
00:40:03,756 --> 00:40:06,006
Her son is a witness.

502
00:40:06,156 --> 00:40:08,156
He'll be testifying in court.

503
00:40:08,326 --> 00:40:12,486
There is obviously a risk
of her exerting pressure on him.

504
00:40:12,656 --> 00:40:14,076
As a consequence,

505
00:40:14,236 --> 00:40:17,326
release on bail is not an option.

506
00:40:17,486 --> 00:40:21,986
I'm asking you to place Mrs Voyter
in detention pending trial.

507
00:40:22,486 --> 00:40:24,986
Thank you.
Over to you, Mrs Boudaoud.

508
00:40:25,216 --> 00:40:28,466
Judge, how can we
consider her a flight risk,

509
00:40:28,616 --> 00:40:30,776
when she's responsible for her son?

510
00:40:31,006 --> 00:40:32,506
That makes no sense.

511
00:40:32,656 --> 00:40:34,696
With a visually impaired child?

512
00:40:34,866 --> 00:40:37,366
And she's all over the media.

513
00:40:37,526 --> 00:40:40,576
Separating them
could compound his trauma.

514
00:40:40,736 --> 00:40:43,946
He had an accident
at the age of four

515
00:40:44,176 --> 00:40:45,216
that damaged his sight.

516
00:40:45,366 --> 00:40:46,946
He's been traumatized,

517
00:40:47,116 --> 00:40:49,696
both psychologically and emotionally.

518
00:40:52,676 --> 00:40:54,426
Mrs Boudaoud, your reaction?

519
00:40:55,136 --> 00:40:58,836
The judge's decision is rare
enough to merit praise.

520
00:40:58,986 --> 00:41:02,486
A judge refusing to give in
to repressive reflexes

521
00:41:02,656 --> 00:41:05,116
is a healthy sign,
especially in such a case.

522
00:41:05,326 --> 00:41:08,736
We feel the release
under judicial supervision

523
00:41:08,906 --> 00:41:11,116
underscores the weakness of the case.

524
00:41:11,326 --> 00:41:12,866
Is your client relieved?

525
00:41:15,826 --> 00:41:18,946
This is a rare decision
in a homicide accusation,

526
00:41:19,116 --> 00:41:21,576
and reads like
a repudiation of Judge Janvier.

527
00:41:21,736 --> 00:41:24,696
Reactions in the hallways
have been intense.

528
00:41:24,926 --> 00:41:28,176
I quote,
"This decision is dangerous."

529
00:41:28,326 --> 00:41:31,156
"The suspect will be reunited
with a major witness."

530
00:41:31,326 --> 00:41:34,526
"It's a real concern
for the upcoming trial."

531
00:41:46,866 --> 00:41:48,696
How could you not tell me about it?

532
00:41:48,866 --> 00:41:50,486
I had no idea he recorded it.

533
00:41:50,586 --> 00:41:51,776
Even if he hadn't...

534
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:54,506
You had a fight
the day before he died.

535
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:13,656
That recording

536
00:42:14,236 --> 00:42:15,946
is not reality.

537
00:42:17,276 --> 00:42:18,696
It's a part of it, maybe,

538
00:42:18,866 --> 00:42:22,946
if you have an extreme moment,
an emotional peak you focus on,

539
00:42:23,116 --> 00:42:25,196
of course it crushes everything.

540
00:42:25,526 --> 00:42:29,576
It may seem like irrefutable proof,
but actually warps everything.

541
00:42:29,736 --> 00:42:33,026
It's not reality. It's our voices,
but it's not who we are.

542
00:42:33,256 --> 00:42:35,756
I don't give a fuck
about what is reality. OK.

543
00:42:36,366 --> 00:42:38,196
You need to start seeing yourself

544
00:42:38,366 --> 00:42:40,326
the way others
are going to perceive you.

545
00:42:40,486 --> 00:42:42,406
The trial is not about the truth.

546
00:42:42,576 --> 00:42:45,366
- I didn't know there'd be a trial.
- Well, there is.

547
00:42:56,366 --> 00:42:59,446
Now, what really counts is...

548
00:43:00,406 --> 00:43:02,486
who you have around you.

549
00:43:02,656 --> 00:43:04,026
There's nobody around me.

550
00:43:04,256 --> 00:43:05,506
Yes, there's Daniel.

551
00:43:06,366 --> 00:43:07,866
Daniel is important.

552
00:43:09,366 --> 00:43:11,986
And didn't you and Samuel have...

553
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:13,696
any friends?

554
00:43:13,866 --> 00:43:17,946
We should never have come here.
I was so happy in London.

555
00:43:20,866 --> 00:43:22,406
It was him, he insisted.

556
00:43:22,576 --> 00:43:25,486
He said there'd be no more
distractions from work.

557
00:43:25,906 --> 00:43:28,326
It would solve
our financial problems.

558
00:43:34,406 --> 00:43:38,946
I left my shithole in Germany
and ended up stuck in his shithole.

559
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:41,076
It's fucking absurd, isn't it? Come on!

560
00:43:49,196 --> 00:43:50,236
- Hello.
- Hello.

561
00:43:52,576 --> 00:43:53,946
Hi, kitten.

562
00:43:55,826 --> 00:43:57,326
This is Mrs Berger,

563
00:43:57,526 --> 00:43:59,906
appointed by the Justice Minister.

564
00:44:00,076 --> 00:44:01,326
Hello.

565
00:44:01,526 --> 00:44:03,276
Vincent Renzi, I work with Nour.

566
00:44:03,736 --> 00:44:06,736
She'll be here regularly, with...

567
00:44:07,486 --> 00:44:09,276
Daniel, and with you.

568
00:44:09,866 --> 00:44:11,826
The frequency will be specified.

569
00:44:11,986 --> 00:44:13,906
She's here...

570
00:44:14,906 --> 00:44:17,576
to ensure that everything goes well.

571
00:44:17,946 --> 00:44:21,696
And that no one
tries to influence Daniel,

572
00:44:21,866 --> 00:44:26,196
or make him say things
he doesn't want to say at the trial.

573
00:44:26,826 --> 00:44:30,446
The judge says you must
speak French in her presence.

574
00:44:32,776 --> 00:44:33,826
Right.

575
00:44:37,406 --> 00:44:38,486
That's it.

576
00:44:40,526 --> 00:44:42,736
May I speak with Daniel in private?

577
00:44:45,986 --> 00:44:47,486
OK, shall we go?

578
00:44:47,656 --> 00:44:48,656
I'll call you.

579
00:44:48,696 --> 00:44:51,866
Your mother will give us
space to get acquainted.

580
00:44:58,576 --> 00:45:00,236
My name is Marge.

581
00:45:00,796 --> 00:45:02,706
We'll see each other a lot.

582
00:45:03,656 --> 00:45:05,576
Do you know why I'm here?

583
00:45:06,366 --> 00:45:07,696
Are you OK with it?

584
00:45:09,116 --> 00:45:10,986
You can consider me a friend.

585
00:45:12,076 --> 00:45:14,276
Or not. That's your choice.

586
00:45:14,446 --> 00:45:15,446
What do you think?

587
00:45:16,406 --> 00:45:17,866
It's OK, I don't...

588
00:45:18,826 --> 00:45:20,946
I don't need us to be friends.

589
00:45:24,366 --> 00:45:27,196
Well, I'm here
to protect your testimony.

590
00:45:27,776 --> 00:45:29,986
The law sent me, and...

591
00:45:30,446 --> 00:45:32,826
the law can't be someone's friend.

592
00:45:32,986 --> 00:45:36,116
Otherwise it couldn't be
someone else's friend,

593
00:45:36,276 --> 00:45:38,736
and the law must be
the same for everyone.

594
00:45:40,026 --> 00:45:42,576
So you're right,
I can't be your friend.

595
00:45:43,776 --> 00:45:47,326
You just have to tell me
if anything feels strange,

596
00:45:47,486 --> 00:45:50,236
if there's a problem,

597
00:45:50,406 --> 00:45:51,486
I don't know,

598
00:45:51,656 --> 00:45:53,406
for example with your mom,

599
00:45:53,576 --> 00:45:55,026
regarding the trial.

600
00:45:56,866 --> 00:46:00,616
I usually discuss stuff like
that with my friends.

601
00:46:03,406 --> 00:46:04,446
Right.

602
00:46:05,026 --> 00:46:07,736
Maybe this time
you don't really have a choice.

603
00:46:29,616 --> 00:46:31,826
With chocolate chips...

604
00:46:34,076 --> 00:46:35,526
and raspberries...

605
00:46:36,826 --> 00:46:39,526
I know it doesn't exist
but that's what I vow.

606
00:46:45,526 --> 00:46:48,026
The archduchess's socks...

607
00:46:49,736 --> 00:46:50,776
What?

608
00:46:51,776 --> 00:46:54,826
The archduchess's socks...

609
00:47:28,196 --> 00:47:30,576
He was
one of the only persons I knew,

610
00:47:30,736 --> 00:47:32,326
when he walked into a room,

611
00:47:32,776 --> 00:47:34,616
something shifted,

612
00:47:34,776 --> 00:47:36,906
the atmosphere changed.

613
00:47:37,236 --> 00:47:40,236
And I suppose that's charm, isn't it?

614
00:47:40,406 --> 00:47:42,906
I fell in love with his charm.

615
00:47:47,116 --> 00:47:51,776
I spend my whole life
not understanding family and friends.

616
00:47:52,656 --> 00:47:56,026
And then he came along,
and I felt like...

617
00:47:57,326 --> 00:48:01,196
I understood what he was saying,
the signals he was sending me.

618
00:48:03,156 --> 00:48:05,026
We didn't necessarily agree,

619
00:48:05,236 --> 00:48:06,906
but we had...

620
00:48:08,576 --> 00:48:10,616
We had things to tell each other.

621
00:48:11,576 --> 00:48:14,196
I realized that later,
when it was gone.

622
00:48:14,866 --> 00:48:16,616
Don't say it's gone.

623
00:48:17,576 --> 00:48:19,526
Just focus on him.

624
00:48:20,406 --> 00:48:21,696
How you met.

625
00:48:23,696 --> 00:48:27,446
When we met, he'd just gotten a job
at a university in London.

626
00:48:28,946 --> 00:48:30,696
So... we moved there together.

627
00:48:32,656 --> 00:48:34,616
He was a great teacher.

628
00:48:35,116 --> 00:48:39,276
He had a way of making everything
sound alive and accessible,

629
00:48:39,446 --> 00:48:40,696
it was great.

630
00:48:43,576 --> 00:48:45,776
But some...
But that wasn't really enough,

631
00:48:46,576 --> 00:48:47,616
so...

632
00:48:48,326 --> 00:48:51,696
Deep down, what he really wanted
to do was to write.

633
00:48:52,326 --> 00:48:54,906
He was working on a novel for years.

634
00:48:55,076 --> 00:48:57,076
I watched him struggle, it was hard.

635
00:49:02,736 --> 00:49:04,406
And I came to realize

636
00:49:04,576 --> 00:49:08,446
his relationship with time,
with work, was...

637
00:49:09,576 --> 00:49:11,616
complicated, unlike for me...

638
00:49:11,776 --> 00:49:14,116
No,
stop comparing yourself to him.

639
00:49:14,346 --> 00:49:15,426
Just to...

640
00:49:15,576 --> 00:49:17,406
Go back to your relationship.

641
00:49:21,076 --> 00:49:25,906
Our relationship revolved
around intellectual stimulation,

642
00:49:26,076 --> 00:49:28,526
even if it meant
neglecting everything else.

643
00:49:29,156 --> 00:49:30,366
Everything else?

644
00:49:31,196 --> 00:49:32,196
Meaning Daniel?

645
00:49:34,176 --> 00:49:36,006
We should mention Daniel
early on.

646
00:49:36,486 --> 00:49:38,026
The accident.

647
00:49:38,196 --> 00:49:40,326
OK. I didn't know it was so...

648
00:49:44,446 --> 00:49:46,076
- It's OK?
- It's OK.

649
00:49:46,826 --> 00:49:50,116
It's just that I didn't know
that it was so...

650
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:52,026
like this, OK.

651
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:58,446
Everything changed
after the accident.

652
00:50:00,076 --> 00:50:01,526
Daniel was four.

653
00:50:03,866 --> 00:50:08,366
That day, Samuel was supposed
to pick him up from school.

654
00:50:08,826 --> 00:50:11,656
But he was on a roll
with his writing, so...

655
00:50:12,156 --> 00:50:16,276
he called a babysitter last minute,
and she showed up late.

656
00:50:17,236 --> 00:50:18,786
As they were crossing the street,

657
00:50:18,886 --> 00:50:20,256
a motorcycle hit Daniel.

658
00:50:20,406 --> 00:50:23,196
His optic nerve
was permanently damaged.

659
00:50:28,366 --> 00:50:29,576
After that,

660
00:50:30,576 --> 00:50:33,526
Samuel became obsessive about it,

661
00:50:33,696 --> 00:50:35,406
he blamed himself on a loop.

662
00:50:35,576 --> 00:50:37,776
If only he'd gone,
picked him up in time...

663
00:50:40,326 --> 00:50:42,776
He was overcome with guilt.

664
00:50:45,776 --> 00:50:48,196
Perhaps he never
truly escaped that feeling.

665
00:50:49,576 --> 00:50:52,406
We spent that whole year
at the hospital,

666
00:50:53,076 --> 00:50:54,326
with Daniel.

667
00:50:55,616 --> 00:50:58,156
We began having financial problems

668
00:50:59,576 --> 00:51:02,776
and Samuel started
taking antidepressants.

669
00:51:04,696 --> 00:51:07,116
Can we please keep that clean,
Vincent?

670
00:51:07,276 --> 00:51:11,196
I'd really like to protect him
and his image, and spare Daniel.

671
00:51:13,576 --> 00:51:14,656
We'll try.

672
00:51:14,826 --> 00:51:15,986
OK.

673
00:51:16,446 --> 00:51:18,826
But it will be like that,
I have to...

674
00:51:19,906 --> 00:51:22,366
I have to admit things.

675
00:51:24,446 --> 00:51:26,906
You have to prepare yourself

676
00:51:27,576 --> 00:51:31,026
to tell everything, and the challenge
is to do it in French.

677
00:51:33,196 --> 00:51:34,656
OK.

678
00:52:12,946 --> 00:52:18,116
One year later.

679
00:52:20,156 --> 00:52:21,986
Are you really interested in...

680
00:52:22,156 --> 00:52:24,866
What interests you?
Come on, sure.

681
00:52:25,776 --> 00:52:28,156
I never see anybody,
I work here all day long,

682
00:52:28,326 --> 00:52:30,736
you come to see me,
of course you interest me.

683
00:52:33,986 --> 00:52:35,156
I run.

684
00:52:35,656 --> 00:52:37,986
It's one of my favorite things to do.

685
00:52:38,156 --> 00:52:40,406
Makes me feel high,
like I'm on drugs.

686
00:52:41,866 --> 00:52:45,026
What do you know about drugs?
That's the next question.

687
00:52:46,616 --> 00:52:47,736
Big subject.

688
00:52:48,696 --> 00:52:50,366
Maybe don't write everything down.

689
00:52:50,446 --> 00:52:52,156
No surely not.

690
00:52:56,696 --> 00:53:00,196
I told you,
we should have done this in Grenoble.

691
00:53:01,076 --> 00:53:02,076
It's fine.

692
00:53:02,196 --> 00:53:03,866
I'll write your answers down.

693
00:53:09,196 --> 00:53:12,696
Do you confirm this is your
interview with Mrs Voyter?

694
00:53:12,866 --> 00:53:13,986
Yes.

695
00:53:14,196 --> 00:53:17,736
She refuses to talk about herself,
yet that's why you came.

696
00:53:17,906 --> 00:53:20,196
I came to talk about her work.

697
00:53:20,366 --> 00:53:23,696
Right, but by constantly
changing the subject,

698
00:53:23,866 --> 00:53:26,616
what was she looking for,
do you suppose?

699
00:53:27,076 --> 00:53:30,156
We can hear it.
She asks about me.

700
00:53:30,826 --> 00:53:34,906
She seemed to enjoy talking about me
more than herself.

701
00:53:35,826 --> 00:53:38,406
Was she inciting you
to talk about yourself?

702
00:53:38,826 --> 00:53:40,196
Inciting...

703
00:53:40,736 --> 00:53:42,736
No, I wouldn't say that.

704
00:53:42,906 --> 00:53:45,326
She wasn't manipulative,
just relaxed.

705
00:53:45,486 --> 00:53:48,906
It felt natural.
She seemed to enjoy the conversation.

706
00:53:49,136 --> 00:53:53,336
You say "relaxed".
We hear her serve you wine at 1:45.

707
00:53:53,486 --> 00:53:56,026
Had she been drinking
before you arrived?

708
00:53:56,776 --> 00:53:57,776
I think so.

709
00:53:57,826 --> 00:54:00,826
Would you say she did her utmost

710
00:54:00,986 --> 00:54:02,366
to make you comfortable,

711
00:54:02,526 --> 00:54:07,156
more than you might've expected
when interviewing a writer?

712
00:54:07,366 --> 00:54:09,986
I wouldn't say that, no.

713
00:54:10,156 --> 00:54:13,156
It seemed like Sandra... Mrs Voyter,

714
00:54:13,326 --> 00:54:16,236
needed to escape, to relax.

715
00:54:16,406 --> 00:54:17,406
- Escape?
- Right.

716
00:54:17,616 --> 00:54:21,276
Did you know that Sandra,
as you call her, was bisexual?

717
00:54:23,076 --> 00:54:24,076
No.

718
00:54:24,116 --> 00:54:25,776
Did you sense it?

719
00:54:25,946 --> 00:54:27,076
No.

720
00:54:27,986 --> 00:54:31,826
Hearing the conversation now,
with hindsight,

721
00:54:32,776 --> 00:54:34,616
would you call it seduction?

722
00:54:36,406 --> 00:54:40,326
I felt, and she told me herself,
that she didn't have

723
00:54:40,486 --> 00:54:44,026
much of a social life
or many chances to talk

724
00:54:44,236 --> 00:54:45,526
to new people.

725
00:54:45,696 --> 00:54:49,616
I suppose you could call that
a form of seduction.

726
00:54:50,406 --> 00:54:54,026
The court needs to know
if you would call it that.

727
00:54:54,946 --> 00:54:56,446
Seduction means several things.

728
00:54:56,616 --> 00:54:59,406
But the word seduction
always implies some...

729
00:54:59,906 --> 00:55:00,906
seduction.

730
00:55:00,946 --> 00:55:02,276
The witness's answer

731
00:55:02,486 --> 00:55:06,236
is clear enough,
as to what she means by seduction.

732
00:55:06,406 --> 00:55:09,866
Mrs Voyter kept expressing
her interest in you.

733
00:55:10,026 --> 00:55:12,576
She wanted to do the interview
in Grenoble.

734
00:55:13,326 --> 00:55:14,326
Didn't you sense...

735
00:55:14,486 --> 00:55:15,986
She answered that question.

736
00:55:16,156 --> 00:55:18,656
Not very clearly.
Please answer, Miss Solidor.

737
00:55:19,076 --> 00:55:20,826
Could you call me Mrs?

738
00:55:21,366 --> 00:55:23,866
I dislike being reduced
to a marital status.

739
00:55:24,026 --> 00:55:26,196
Of course.
That wasn't my intention.

740
00:55:26,526 --> 00:55:28,826
I didn't feel seduced in the moment.

741
00:55:28,986 --> 00:55:31,656
So you did wonder afterwards?

742
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:35,076
I found it atypical, nothing more.

743
00:55:35,276 --> 00:55:39,406
How did you interpret the song
Samuel Maleski played?

744
00:55:40,616 --> 00:55:42,616
I felt tension around the noise.

745
00:55:42,776 --> 00:55:47,156
Samuel Maleski imposing
his presence without showing himself.

746
00:55:47,486 --> 00:55:49,026
And Sandra's reaction...

747
00:55:49,236 --> 00:55:50,776
What was her reaction?

748
00:55:52,906 --> 00:55:54,776
She was a bit annoyed.

749
00:55:55,446 --> 00:55:58,026
And when the song started over?

750
00:55:58,656 --> 00:56:00,366
He was playing it on a loop.

751
00:56:01,656 --> 00:56:03,116
Clearly...

752
00:56:03,576 --> 00:56:04,776
good deduction.

753
00:56:04,946 --> 00:56:07,946
But how did it feel to you
in the moment?

754
00:56:08,616 --> 00:56:10,236
It added to the strangeness.

755
00:56:10,986 --> 00:56:13,486
I felt my presence was less...

756
00:56:15,016 --> 00:56:16,376
It was less relaxed.

757
00:56:16,486 --> 00:56:18,196
So you clearly felt tension.

758
00:56:18,366 --> 00:56:21,116
- You're nitpicking.
- No, just clarifying.

759
00:56:21,276 --> 00:56:22,986
Did you feel tension?

760
00:56:23,156 --> 00:56:24,236
Yes.

761
00:56:25,826 --> 00:56:29,486
Did you feel that Mr. Maleski,
by playing that music,

762
00:56:30,026 --> 00:56:33,156
wanted to disrupt, or interrupt,
your interview?

763
00:56:33,396 --> 00:56:35,646
That was my first thought, yes.

764
00:56:36,696 --> 00:56:41,076
But it's hard to read the intentions
of someone you can't see.

765
00:56:41,696 --> 00:56:43,526
That's what they pay me for!

766
00:56:45,366 --> 00:56:46,656
Sandra Voyter,

767
00:56:47,156 --> 00:56:50,236
you sought a connection
to divert the interview.

768
00:56:50,466 --> 00:56:51,836
Correct?

769
00:56:51,986 --> 00:56:53,526
That's a leading question.

770
00:56:53,696 --> 00:56:55,406
There was no seduction.

771
00:56:55,736 --> 00:56:57,776
My question concerns your connection.

772
00:56:57,946 --> 00:57:02,026
In the recording you're chummy,
laughing, drinking wine.

773
00:57:02,196 --> 00:57:05,196
Were you seeking escape
from a difficult home-life

774
00:57:05,366 --> 00:57:07,446
by connecting with this young woman?

775
00:57:07,616 --> 00:57:10,196
Mrs Voyter
did not initiate the meeting.

776
00:57:10,406 --> 00:57:12,366
Please answer, Mrs Voyter.

777
00:57:14,196 --> 00:57:16,526
Yes, I found her surprising.

778
00:57:16,696 --> 00:57:19,526
I hadn't seen anyone new in a while.

779
00:57:19,696 --> 00:57:21,986
And yes, I needed a drink.

780
00:57:22,156 --> 00:57:26,326
This person was intelligent and nice,
nothing more.

781
00:57:27,196 --> 00:57:31,026
That interview was hardly enough
to base a thesis on!

782
00:57:31,196 --> 00:57:35,736
She can have a laugh with a student
whose questions don't thrill her.

783
00:57:35,906 --> 00:57:38,986
Would you say the music
Mr. Maleski played

784
00:57:39,156 --> 00:57:41,156
so aggressively

785
00:57:41,326 --> 00:57:43,196
indicated he was jealous of you,

786
00:57:43,366 --> 00:57:45,526
or Miss... Mrs Solidor? Sorry.

787
00:57:45,736 --> 00:57:48,406
The music was a cover
of 50 Cent's P.I.M.P.,

788
00:57:48,576 --> 00:57:50,826
a deeply misogynistic song.

789
00:57:50,986 --> 00:57:52,776
It was an instrumental version.

790
00:57:52,946 --> 00:57:54,406
Answer, please.

791
00:57:54,616 --> 00:57:58,406
Could your husband's song choice
express his jealousy?

792
00:57:58,576 --> 00:57:59,576
I can answer.

793
00:58:01,026 --> 00:58:04,526
He often played that song.
I doubt it was intentional.

794
00:58:05,576 --> 00:58:08,776
He loved loud music, it relaxed him.

795
00:58:10,446 --> 00:58:13,276
He had purposefully installed...

796
00:58:14,736 --> 00:58:16,616
What is a "speaker"? Sorry.

797
00:58:17,616 --> 00:58:20,236
A powerful speaker... sorry.

798
00:58:21,026 --> 00:58:22,986
He worked a lot, it was noisy...

799
00:58:23,196 --> 00:58:26,526
Mrs Solidor says
you ended the interview over that.

800
00:58:26,696 --> 00:58:29,156
- Is that true?
- She never said that.

801
00:58:29,326 --> 00:58:30,626
If the defense

802
00:58:31,236 --> 00:58:34,406
keeps reacting to every question,

803
00:58:34,576 --> 00:58:36,486
I'll be very irritated.

804
00:58:37,616 --> 00:58:39,576
Mrs Voyter, answer the question.

805
00:58:42,236 --> 00:58:44,866
The music was just very loud.

806
00:58:45,026 --> 00:58:47,196
And when it started over,

807
00:58:47,366 --> 00:58:50,406
I realized it wasn't going to stop.

808
00:58:51,906 --> 00:58:54,866
That made discussion difficult.

809
00:58:55,026 --> 00:58:56,906
So I...

810
00:58:57,946 --> 00:58:59,406
I preferred to stop.

811
00:59:00,026 --> 00:59:02,326
And I was tired, yes.

812
00:59:02,486 --> 00:59:03,736
And I felt a bit...

813
00:59:05,576 --> 00:59:07,446
woozy, from the wine.

814
00:59:08,196 --> 00:59:11,736
Yet once alone, you didn't ask
him to explain his behavior?

815
00:59:13,526 --> 00:59:15,736
As I said, it was habitual.

816
00:59:15,906 --> 00:59:17,236
No.

817
00:59:17,446 --> 00:59:20,576
You entertaining
an attractive young woman

818
00:59:20,736 --> 00:59:24,236
while he toiled upstairs
was neither habitual, nor neutral.

819
00:59:24,406 --> 00:59:27,236
He knew you liked women.
You'd recently cheated.

820
00:59:27,406 --> 00:59:28,986
That's beside the point.

821
00:59:29,216 --> 00:59:30,106
And sexist.

822
00:59:30,196 --> 00:59:33,066
I'd have said the same
if she were an attractive man.

823
00:59:33,196 --> 00:59:36,906
Excuse me, but this couple's
conflicts matter here.

824
00:59:37,116 --> 00:59:39,986
There's something
a bit strange in this situation.

825
00:59:40,156 --> 00:59:43,736
You say you went upstairs
to your room to work and sleep.

826
00:59:43,906 --> 00:59:47,406
Right below the attic
with the deafening music.

827
00:59:47,576 --> 00:59:50,736
Music that had made
the interview impossible.

828
00:59:50,906 --> 00:59:53,156
In that big house,
you chose that spot?

829
00:59:53,366 --> 00:59:57,116
Yes, that's where I work.
I always work in bed.

830
00:59:59,576 --> 01:00:02,826
When Samuel came to talk to you,
you didn't complain?

831
01:00:02,986 --> 01:00:06,276
Deafening music overhead
is hardly normal.

832
01:00:08,196 --> 01:00:09,696
I'm used to it, I don't mind.

833
01:00:09,866 --> 01:00:12,616
I wanted to work, I had my earplugs.

834
01:00:12,776 --> 01:00:13,826
It was normal.

835
01:00:14,616 --> 01:00:16,616
I can work in any situation.

836
01:00:16,826 --> 01:00:19,486
You said you were tired,
woozy from the wine.

837
01:00:19,656 --> 01:00:21,526
Yet you wanted to work?

838
01:00:21,736 --> 01:00:22,736
Yes.

839
01:00:22,866 --> 01:00:24,616
And I did. Not for long.

840
01:00:24,776 --> 01:00:26,326
A translation was due.

841
01:00:26,486 --> 01:00:28,736
I wanted to finish it before resting.

842
01:00:29,326 --> 01:00:33,366
As I said, I can work
in any environment, any condition.

843
01:00:33,576 --> 01:00:36,736
Apparently you can also rest
anywhere, anytime.

844
01:00:36,906 --> 01:00:39,026
So all was well with the world.

845
01:00:44,116 --> 01:00:45,136
That's all.

846
01:00:48,736 --> 01:00:50,116
No further questions.

847
01:00:53,196 --> 01:00:55,366
Daniel, that's not what you told us.

848
01:00:55,526 --> 01:00:58,446
Zoe Solidor saw you
leave the house after she left.

849
01:00:58,616 --> 01:01:01,906
And your mom says
she spoke to your dad after that.

850
01:01:03,526 --> 01:01:04,736
I got mixed up.

851
01:01:05,576 --> 01:01:06,826
You got mixed up.

852
01:01:13,076 --> 01:01:15,276
Indeed there is a problem, Daniel.

853
01:01:15,446 --> 01:01:16,446
Right?

854
01:01:16,576 --> 01:01:19,276
You couldn't be two places at once.

855
01:01:20,776 --> 01:01:23,156
I think I went back inside.

856
01:01:25,906 --> 01:01:30,076
What bothers me is how sure you were
before the reenactment.

857
01:01:30,446 --> 01:01:32,656
You said in your statement:

858
01:01:32,826 --> 01:01:35,576
"Each piece of tape feels different."

859
01:01:35,736 --> 01:01:38,446
"I wouldn't get it wrong."

860
01:01:39,076 --> 01:01:41,736
And:
"I was just below the open window."

861
01:01:41,906 --> 01:01:43,736
"I know what I heard."

862
01:01:43,906 --> 01:01:47,486
Then, during the reenactment,
you said something else entirely.

863
01:01:47,656 --> 01:01:49,276
How come?

864
01:01:51,986 --> 01:01:55,026
I thought
I remembered where I was, but...

865
01:01:57,526 --> 01:02:01,276
Maybe the shock of what happened next
got me mixed up.

866
01:02:01,656 --> 01:02:03,776
A psychiatrist who met with Daniel

867
01:02:03,946 --> 01:02:07,736
says emotional shock
may have altered some memories.

868
01:02:08,186 --> 01:02:09,096
Of course.

869
01:02:09,196 --> 01:02:12,026
Do you remember now
why you came back inside?

870
01:02:14,236 --> 01:02:16,236
I think I must've forgotten...

871
01:02:16,906 --> 01:02:18,526
my gloves or my phone.

872
01:02:19,406 --> 01:02:20,736
But you're not sure?

873
01:02:22,236 --> 01:02:23,986
I don't remember exactly.

874
01:02:24,156 --> 01:02:27,656
So, you went from absolute certainty
to uncertainty

875
01:02:27,826 --> 01:02:30,236
about your memories of that day.

876
01:02:30,406 --> 01:02:32,326
This is very problematic.

877
01:02:32,486 --> 01:02:35,486
You're fixating on one detail
in his memory

878
01:02:35,656 --> 01:02:38,196
to cast doubt on his whole memory.

879
01:02:38,616 --> 01:02:40,326
What do you want us to believe?

880
01:02:40,486 --> 01:02:43,826
That shock may have turned yelling
into calm voices?

881
01:02:43,986 --> 01:02:46,906
You insinuate
he lied to protect his mother.

882
01:02:47,076 --> 01:02:48,196
No.

883
01:02:48,736 --> 01:02:51,026
I'm merely signaling
the witness's doubts.

884
01:02:51,196 --> 01:02:53,446
But we are entitled to wonder.

885
01:02:53,616 --> 01:02:57,446
Daniel Maleski says he would leave
when his parents fought.

886
01:02:57,616 --> 01:03:00,826
Whereas on that day,
he happens to go out

887
01:03:00,986 --> 01:03:03,736
right when an argument
is likely to erupt.

888
01:03:03,906 --> 01:03:05,826
Thus, he doesn't hear a thing.

889
01:03:06,276 --> 01:03:08,906
I didn't happen to go out.
I fled the music.

890
01:03:09,076 --> 01:03:13,076
And he's very precise
about what he heard.

891
01:03:13,236 --> 01:03:14,906
He's never budged on that.

892
01:03:15,486 --> 01:03:18,696
The psychiatrist
and visual impairment expert

893
01:03:18,866 --> 01:03:22,116
both observed
Daniel's excellent aural memory.

894
01:03:28,276 --> 01:03:31,696
Clerk, please display

895
01:03:31,866 --> 01:03:34,366
the elements provided by Mr. Balard.

896
01:03:36,736 --> 01:03:38,276
We're listening.

897
01:03:38,446 --> 01:03:41,946
The decisive element here
is the three blood spatters

898
01:03:42,176 --> 01:03:43,506
on the woodshed,

899
01:03:43,656 --> 01:03:46,276
as indicated on the sketch.

900
01:03:47,236 --> 01:03:49,986
Can we zoom in on the woodshed?

901
01:03:51,326 --> 01:03:55,116
Their shape is typical of spatter
projected from high above.

902
01:03:55,346 --> 01:03:57,596
They are long and narrow.

903
01:03:57,796 --> 01:04:02,046
The longest measures 4 centimeters,
which is a lot.

904
01:04:02,576 --> 01:04:04,236
So, according to our tests,

905
01:04:04,406 --> 01:04:06,946
these spatters
could only have landed here

906
01:04:07,116 --> 01:04:09,656
if Mr. Maleski was struck on the head

907
01:04:09,826 --> 01:04:12,236
while on the 3rd floor balcony.

908
01:04:13,276 --> 01:04:16,326
He would have to have been
leaning over the balcony,

909
01:04:16,486 --> 01:04:20,156
his head already quite far out
when the blow was struck,

910
01:04:20,326 --> 01:04:22,906
for the spatter to land there.

911
01:04:23,136 --> 01:04:24,926
No other explanation stands.

912
01:04:25,076 --> 01:04:28,986
Did the violence of the blow
make Mr. Maleski fall?

913
01:04:29,156 --> 01:04:30,276
Most likely,

914
01:04:30,486 --> 01:04:33,906
it was the combination
of a violent blow

915
01:04:34,076 --> 01:04:36,156
and a deliberate push.

916
01:04:36,326 --> 01:04:40,116
Would you say the aggressor
was in a state of extreme anger,

917
01:04:40,326 --> 01:04:43,946
to provoke a fall after
administering such a violent blow?

918
01:04:44,156 --> 01:04:46,276
A state of rage, I'd say.

919
01:04:46,446 --> 01:04:48,076
Hard to imagine anything less.

920
01:04:48,276 --> 01:04:52,446
Such states
can increase physical strength.

921
01:05:03,776 --> 01:05:08,526
The guardrail is 1.2 meters high.

922
01:05:08,696 --> 01:05:11,736
Comes up to about here.

923
01:05:12,236 --> 01:05:14,906
Mr. Maleski was 1.82 meters tall

924
01:05:15,076 --> 01:05:17,196
and weighed 85 kilos.

925
01:05:17,526 --> 01:05:20,576
So, pushing him over that guardrail

926
01:05:20,736 --> 01:05:24,486
would have required
a very deliberate push, right?

927
01:05:24,656 --> 01:05:27,656
The entire act was very deliberate.

928
01:05:27,826 --> 01:05:29,986
Such a blow is always intentional.

929
01:05:30,196 --> 01:05:32,326
What I mean by very deliberate is...

930
01:05:32,486 --> 01:05:35,276
very coordinated. Methodical.

931
01:05:35,446 --> 01:05:37,866
Based on his weight, we can assume

932
01:05:38,026 --> 01:05:41,486
it was necessary to lift his legs
to make him fall,

933
01:05:41,656 --> 01:05:43,616
which hardly suggests rage.

934
01:05:43,776 --> 01:05:45,486
Rage does not exclude will.

935
01:05:45,656 --> 01:05:49,826
And Mr. Maleski was probably
already off-balance.

936
01:05:49,986 --> 01:05:51,576
He may have fallen

937
01:05:51,736 --> 01:05:55,156
as much from the blow
as from his own unstable position.

938
01:05:55,366 --> 01:05:58,076
As I said,
we have no material elements...

939
01:05:58,236 --> 01:06:00,366
Except those 3 drops of blood.

940
01:06:01,446 --> 01:06:06,406
Everything else must be speculated
to explain those drops, right?

941
01:06:06,576 --> 01:06:09,866
OK, but the only explanation
is the one I gave.

942
01:06:10,096 --> 01:06:13,426
You gave us a theory,
not an explanation.

943
01:06:13,576 --> 01:06:15,026
Actually, two theories.

944
01:06:15,236 --> 01:06:18,326
With and without a deliberate push.

945
01:06:19,026 --> 01:06:20,696
According to your theories,

946
01:06:20,906 --> 01:06:22,946
what type of object was used?

947
01:06:23,116 --> 01:06:25,696
A heavy object, probably in metal

948
01:06:25,906 --> 01:06:27,866
or dense wood,

949
01:06:28,026 --> 01:06:30,236
and undoubtedly with a sharp edge.

950
01:06:30,776 --> 01:06:34,326
Did you examine any such objects
found on the premises?

951
01:06:34,486 --> 01:06:37,116
You know no weapon was found.

952
01:06:37,276 --> 01:06:39,076
They're easily disposed of.

953
01:06:39,696 --> 01:06:41,236
No further questions.

954
01:06:43,406 --> 01:06:46,326
Two possible explanations
for these 3 spatters.

955
01:06:46,486 --> 01:06:50,616
Either they came from here,
after a violent blow.

956
01:06:51,156 --> 01:06:54,026
Or they resulted when the skull

957
01:06:54,196 --> 01:06:55,866
hit this roof ledge,

958
01:06:56,076 --> 01:06:57,486
approximately here.

959
01:06:57,826 --> 01:06:59,656
The first hypothesis is unlikely.

960
01:06:59,826 --> 01:07:04,276
It's inconsistent with the shape
and movement of the spatters.

961
01:07:05,256 --> 01:07:07,046
Focusing on the second hypothesis,

962
01:07:07,196 --> 01:07:10,946
we must take into account
the bounce caused by the impact

963
01:07:11,116 --> 01:07:12,446
on the roof ledge.

964
01:07:13,276 --> 01:07:16,446
I'll show you a video
of our in-situ tests.

965
01:07:21,966 --> 01:07:22,876
There.

966
01:07:22,946 --> 01:07:26,696
As you can see
in our reenactment with a dummy,

967
01:07:26,926 --> 01:07:30,046
such an impact
causes the body to turn abruptly.

968
01:07:30,196 --> 01:07:33,656
And during that rollover, or spin,

969
01:07:34,026 --> 01:07:36,156
a fraction of a second after impact,

970
01:07:36,326 --> 01:07:40,196
these 3 spatters are projected

971
01:07:40,426 --> 01:07:41,876
onto this surface.

972
01:07:45,486 --> 01:07:47,276
The only valid explanation

973
01:07:47,446 --> 01:07:50,986
is that Mr. Maleski
fell from the attic window.

974
01:07:51,156 --> 01:07:52,446
I believe it's the only way

975
01:07:52,656 --> 01:07:54,946
he could've bounced off the roof,

976
01:07:55,426 --> 01:07:57,006
and sustained such an injury.

977
01:07:57,156 --> 01:07:59,526
You use the cautious qualifier
"I believe".

978
01:07:59,696 --> 01:08:00,986
So it's your opinion.

979
01:08:01,576 --> 01:08:04,326
How do you explain
the lack of DNA or trace tissue

980
01:08:04,526 --> 01:08:07,906
at the point of impact,
or "bounce" as you call it?

981
01:08:08,406 --> 01:08:09,986
I'll show you.

982
01:08:10,156 --> 01:08:12,276
This is a test we carried out

983
01:08:12,506 --> 01:08:14,586
under comparable conditions.

984
01:08:14,736 --> 01:08:17,906
At the time of the incident,
there was a layer of ice

985
01:08:18,076 --> 01:08:20,736
underneath a thick layer of snow.

986
01:08:21,946 --> 01:08:25,116
We see the snow melting
in acceleration.

987
01:08:25,276 --> 01:08:26,616
And we can see,

988
01:08:26,776 --> 01:08:30,696
during 1 hour and 50 minutes,
that the runoff

989
01:08:31,196 --> 01:08:34,826
takes with it all residue
embedded at the point of impact.

990
01:08:34,906 --> 01:08:36,696
It ends up with the blood
that was already

991
01:08:36,796 --> 01:08:37,876
down here.

992
01:08:38,026 --> 01:08:41,656
You call the violent blow hypothesis
"improbable".

993
01:08:41,826 --> 01:08:43,776
Would you call it impossible?

994
01:08:45,076 --> 01:08:46,946
No, but highly improbable.

995
01:08:47,116 --> 01:08:48,776
Meaning it is possible.

996
01:08:49,156 --> 01:08:51,946
As it's possible
I'll be president someday.

997
01:08:52,176 --> 01:08:53,546
I know the definition.

998
01:08:53,696 --> 01:08:55,156
It's improbable for a reason.

999
01:08:55,326 --> 01:08:58,486
In your hypothesis,
in order to explain the angle

1000
01:08:58,716 --> 01:09:00,126
of these 3 spatters,

1001
01:09:00,276 --> 01:09:03,656
we have to imagine
that Mr. Maleski's head

1002
01:09:03,826 --> 01:09:07,366
was leaning way out,
around 80 cm past the guardrail.

1003
01:09:07,526 --> 01:09:10,486
This implies the aggressor forced him

1004
01:09:10,696 --> 01:09:12,696
to lean backwards over the void,

1005
01:09:13,276 --> 01:09:15,736
shoving him against the guardrail,

1006
01:09:15,906 --> 01:09:18,906
his entire torso pitched backwards.

1007
01:09:19,236 --> 01:09:23,576
The aggressor would have
to be leaning very far out

1008
01:09:23,776 --> 01:09:26,156
while holding a heavy object

1009
01:09:26,326 --> 01:09:29,486
and striking the victim
with powerful momentum.

1010
01:09:29,656 --> 01:09:30,946
All these elements,

1011
01:09:31,116 --> 01:09:33,986
in addition to
the defendant's body mass,

1012
01:09:34,156 --> 01:09:36,326
make this hypothesis highly improbable.

1013
01:09:36,486 --> 01:09:37,656
But not impossible.

1014
01:09:42,076 --> 01:09:45,196
Listen Daniel,
I asked to see you because...

1015
01:09:45,366 --> 01:09:48,616
I know you have a vested interest
in this case.

1016
01:09:48,776 --> 01:09:51,486
I've allowed you
to attend the trial so far.

1017
01:09:51,656 --> 01:09:53,026
But tomorrow will be

1018
01:09:53,256 --> 01:09:55,046
far more complicated.

1019
01:09:55,196 --> 01:09:57,986
We'll be covering
some disturbing details,

1020
01:09:58,156 --> 01:10:00,656
so I've decided
you won't be attending.

1021
01:10:01,776 --> 01:10:03,446
I think I can hear anything.

1022
01:10:03,616 --> 01:10:04,446
What?

1023
01:10:04,616 --> 01:10:06,576
I think I can hear anything.

1024
01:10:06,986 --> 01:10:08,776
- Yeah?
- I'm prepared.

1025
01:10:08,946 --> 01:10:12,026
You can hear it,
but can you handle it?

1026
01:10:12,196 --> 01:10:13,776
We have a job to do.

1027
01:10:13,946 --> 01:10:17,526
We need to be able to work...
with serenity.

1028
01:10:17,696 --> 01:10:19,326
I've never disrupted the trial.

1029
01:10:19,486 --> 01:10:20,986
Disrupted...

1030
01:10:21,326 --> 01:10:23,026
That's not the point.

1031
01:10:24,366 --> 01:10:27,656
We need to be able
to evoke the facts bluntly.

1032
01:10:28,906 --> 01:10:30,986
We have to address everything,

1033
01:10:31,156 --> 01:10:33,526
without fear of hurting you.

1034
01:10:36,236 --> 01:10:37,986
I've already been hurt.

1035
01:10:39,696 --> 01:10:41,906
And that's why I need...

1036
01:10:43,276 --> 01:10:45,446
to hear, so I can get past it.

1037
01:10:45,616 --> 01:10:47,736
The trial is not about you hearing.

1038
01:10:47,906 --> 01:10:50,276
It's about establishing the truth,

1039
01:10:50,446 --> 01:10:53,196
without being forced
to censor ourselves.

1040
01:10:53,656 --> 01:10:56,156
When has anyone
censored themselves?

1041
01:10:57,346 --> 01:11:00,006
Even if you forbid me to come,

1042
01:11:00,406 --> 01:11:02,946
I'll find out.
I'll know what happened

1043
01:11:03,116 --> 01:11:04,946
from TV, radio, internet.

1044
01:11:05,826 --> 01:11:07,446
I'll be obsessed.

1045
01:11:19,526 --> 01:11:21,366
Mrs Voyter, you claim

1046
01:11:21,576 --> 01:11:24,906
your husband attempted suicide
6 months before he died.

1047
01:11:25,276 --> 01:11:28,446
You remembered late,
which is quite surprising.

1048
01:11:28,616 --> 01:11:31,576
Can you describe
the episode in detail?

1049
01:11:31,736 --> 01:11:32,906
Yes.

1050
01:11:38,736 --> 01:11:43,236
It happened a few weeks
after he stopped his medication.

1051
01:11:44,366 --> 01:11:46,866
I found him lying on the floor...

1052
01:11:47,906 --> 01:11:50,236
early in the morning, in his room.

1053
01:11:51,986 --> 01:11:53,156
He'd...

1054
01:11:53,526 --> 01:11:55,276
had a lot to drink..

1055
01:11:56,026 --> 01:11:58,736
The night before, and passed out.

1056
01:12:00,326 --> 01:12:03,736
He'd vomited,
and in the vomit, I saw aspirin.

1057
01:12:04,616 --> 01:12:07,986
The pills had nearly dissolved.

1058
01:12:10,076 --> 01:12:12,866
At first I didn't understand
what it was.

1059
01:12:13,616 --> 01:12:16,076
But later, I found...

1060
01:12:16,776 --> 01:12:19,576
empty blister packs
in the kitchen garbage.

1061
01:12:20,696 --> 01:12:23,326
I cleaned it all up
and put him in bed.

1062
01:12:23,906 --> 01:12:25,156
Later,

1063
01:12:25,326 --> 01:12:26,946
when he felt better,

1064
01:12:27,156 --> 01:12:29,076
he didn't want to discuss it.

1065
01:12:29,236 --> 01:12:32,026
He just said he'd
stopped his meds too soon.

1066
01:12:33,696 --> 01:12:35,656
You had separate bedrooms?

1067
01:12:36,656 --> 01:12:40,076
It was his office,
and he usually slept there, yes.

1068
01:12:41,736 --> 01:12:46,026
I see. What made you
go into his room so early?

1069
01:12:46,196 --> 01:12:48,736
I wake up very early.
He did too, sometimes.

1070
01:12:48,906 --> 01:12:52,156
We occasionally spent that time
together, talking.

1071
01:12:52,326 --> 01:12:53,736
At 6 in the morning?

1072
01:12:53,906 --> 01:12:56,366
Yes, if I saw the light on. Yes.

1073
01:12:57,156 --> 01:13:00,236
We'd stopped sharing a bed,
but we were very close.

1074
01:13:00,406 --> 01:13:02,236
I would often...

1075
01:13:03,326 --> 01:13:06,326
finish the night with him,
in the office bed.

1076
01:13:07,826 --> 01:13:09,736
I'd gone down to make coffee.

1077
01:13:09,906 --> 01:13:12,906
I saw his door was ajar, and...

1078
01:13:13,446 --> 01:13:15,486
I saw him lying on the floor.

1079
01:13:15,906 --> 01:13:18,076
No one else witnessed that?

1080
01:13:18,196 --> 01:13:19,196
No.

1081
01:13:19,526 --> 01:13:21,946
Thank you, you may sit down.

1082
01:13:24,236 --> 01:13:25,616
Did you know that?

1083
01:13:27,406 --> 01:13:29,156
Which antidepressant
did you prescribe?

1084
01:13:29,326 --> 01:13:31,076
Escitalopram, 20 mg per day.

1085
01:13:31,276 --> 01:13:33,326
- Was it his choice to stop?
- Yes.

1086
01:13:33,736 --> 01:13:36,946
About 7 months before he died
he wanted to wean off.

1087
01:13:37,116 --> 01:13:40,906
I recommended a tapering plan
with weekly check-ins.

1088
01:13:41,076 --> 01:13:42,576
Any suicidal ideation?

1089
01:13:43,326 --> 01:13:45,236
No, Samuel wasn't depressive.

1090
01:13:45,406 --> 01:13:48,576
I'd prescribed Escitalopram
as an emotional shield

1091
01:13:49,406 --> 01:13:52,116
to help him cope
after his son's accident.

1092
01:13:52,276 --> 01:13:56,736
Can sudden withdrawal from a low dose
trigger a suicide attempt?

1093
01:13:57,596 --> 01:13:59,846
Anything's possible in theory,

1094
01:13:59,986 --> 01:14:04,236
but why would he have asked me
to help him wean off,

1095
01:14:04,406 --> 01:14:07,326
then stop behind my back?
Makes no sense.

1096
01:14:07,486 --> 01:14:10,326
And no mention of it
in our weekly sessions?

1097
01:14:23,406 --> 01:14:26,616
Have you ever had a patient
commit suicide,

1098
01:14:26,846 --> 01:14:28,466
or attempt suicide?

1099
01:14:28,616 --> 01:14:30,866
In French, "committing suicide"

1100
01:14:31,026 --> 01:14:34,656
means both trying and succeeding.

1101
01:14:34,886 --> 01:14:35,886
It's the action.

1102
01:14:36,026 --> 01:14:37,696
Thanks for the language lesson.

1103
01:14:38,176 --> 01:14:39,626
No patient has committed suicide.

1104
01:14:39,776 --> 01:14:42,116
Aside from Mr. Maleski,

1105
01:14:42,276 --> 01:14:44,826
since we're here
to rule on the question.

1106
01:14:44,986 --> 01:14:46,276
In any case,

1107
01:14:46,446 --> 01:14:49,236
we can't consider you
an expert on suicide,

1108
01:14:49,406 --> 01:14:50,576
failed or successful.

1109
01:14:51,326 --> 01:14:54,736
You said your husband
refused to discuss it with you,

1110
01:14:54,906 --> 01:14:56,656
or anyone else, apparently.

1111
01:14:56,826 --> 01:14:58,116
Why, do you think?

1112
01:15:00,576 --> 01:15:02,156
Because he was ashamed.

1113
01:15:02,326 --> 01:15:04,576
He had a lot of...

1114
01:15:09,276 --> 01:15:11,526
It's too complicated.
Can I change the language, please?

1115
01:15:13,116 --> 01:15:14,366
Thanks.

1116
01:15:16,276 --> 01:15:18,366
Yeah, I think because he was ashamed.

1117
01:15:19,556 --> 01:15:22,596
Samuel had
a lot of issues with shame.

1118
01:15:22,796 --> 01:15:24,126
It's complicated.

1119
01:15:27,236 --> 01:15:31,236
He was frustrated with teaching.
It had become a burden,

1120
01:15:31,946 --> 01:15:33,616
and he wanted to write.

1121
01:15:34,406 --> 01:15:36,526
He'd been working
on a novel for years,

1122
01:15:36,696 --> 01:15:38,826
before and after Daniel's accident.

1123
01:15:40,446 --> 01:15:41,736
I read everything he wrote.

1124
01:15:41,906 --> 01:15:44,196
I thought it was really good
and I told him so.

1125
01:15:44,656 --> 01:15:46,616
But from one day to another,
he just...

1126
01:15:47,156 --> 01:15:49,776
couldn't do it anymore,
he just stopped.

1127
01:15:51,276 --> 01:15:53,366
It made him feel like a coward.

1128
01:15:54,156 --> 01:15:56,276
He would belittle himself.

1129
01:15:57,696 --> 01:16:00,486
He ended up convincing himself
he could not write

1130
01:16:00,656 --> 01:16:03,656
because of his dependency
on the medication.

1131
01:16:03,826 --> 01:16:05,656
He wanted to free himself of that,

1132
01:16:05,826 --> 01:16:08,116
and he could not, of course not...

1133
01:16:08,276 --> 01:16:09,906
I'm sorry, I'm not finished.

1134
01:16:10,076 --> 01:16:12,716
He could not talk about
the suicide attempt

1135
01:16:12,826 --> 01:16:16,276
because his feelings of failure
were just too painful.

1136
01:16:16,446 --> 01:16:18,156
He never spoke of that.

1137
01:16:18,326 --> 01:16:19,326
Not once.

1138
01:16:19,366 --> 01:16:23,156
He blamed you for getting him hooked
on the pills from the first session.

1139
01:16:23,326 --> 01:16:24,446
It drove him mad.

1140
01:16:24,656 --> 01:16:26,156
He and I decided together.

1141
01:16:26,326 --> 01:16:29,826
You can't deny you're at the center
of this equation.

1142
01:16:30,236 --> 01:16:33,656
Samuel came to see me
because he felt guilty,

1143
01:16:33,826 --> 01:16:36,486
but mostly because you blamed him.

1144
01:16:36,656 --> 01:16:39,076
He described your behavior

1145
01:16:39,236 --> 01:16:41,326
as quite castrating.

1146
01:16:41,736 --> 01:16:43,696
You made him pay

1147
01:16:44,026 --> 01:16:45,776
for the accident

1148
01:16:45,986 --> 01:16:49,406
by forcing him to give up
what mattered most to him:

1149
01:16:49,576 --> 01:16:50,616
Writing.

1150
01:16:51,446 --> 01:16:54,866
You put him on
an emotional roller coaster.

1151
01:16:55,076 --> 01:16:57,236
On the one hand, it's true,

1152
01:16:57,406 --> 01:17:00,326
you encouraged him to write,
wanted him to succeed.

1153
01:17:00,486 --> 01:17:03,906
But if he had,
it would've been unbearable for you.

1154
01:17:04,076 --> 01:17:06,906
That's the problem.
It may have been subconscious.

1155
01:17:08,076 --> 01:17:11,406
All the material
and psychological burdens

1156
01:17:11,576 --> 01:17:14,116
resulting from the accident
were his to bear.

1157
01:17:14,276 --> 01:17:17,196
It's as though you said,
"This is your problem."

1158
01:17:17,366 --> 01:17:19,366
"You're responsible. Deal with it."

1159
01:17:19,526 --> 01:17:22,366
"I want to free myself from that,
to write."

1160
01:17:22,526 --> 01:17:24,116
Material burdens

1161
01:17:24,276 --> 01:17:27,406
were managed by Mrs Voyter
as much as her husband.

1162
01:17:27,576 --> 01:17:30,986
We have their bank statements,
receipts, etc.

1163
01:17:31,196 --> 01:17:33,826
I'm also talking about
the emotional load.

1164
01:17:33,986 --> 01:17:36,696
Responsibilities, sense of purpose,

1165
01:17:37,366 --> 01:17:38,576
anxiety.

1166
01:17:38,736 --> 01:17:43,156
In those areas,
Samuel felt an unbearable imbalance.

1167
01:17:43,326 --> 01:17:45,696
So what your patients
tell you is the truth?

1168
01:17:45,866 --> 01:17:47,986
As a psychoanalyst,

1169
01:17:48,156 --> 01:17:50,866
you never wondered
whether Samuel Maleski

1170
01:17:51,026 --> 01:17:54,736
might've needed to imagine
an unbearable imbalance

1171
01:17:54,906 --> 01:17:56,906
to prevent himself from writing?

1172
01:17:57,076 --> 01:18:01,076
After a while, I can tell
what's real and what isn't.

1173
01:18:01,276 --> 01:18:02,486
Lucky you.

1174
01:18:02,656 --> 01:18:04,406
I'm sorry to interrupt.

1175
01:18:04,826 --> 01:18:06,116
But...

1176
01:18:06,486 --> 01:18:08,906
I don't know. You come here,

1177
01:18:09,076 --> 01:18:12,526
OK, with maybe your opinion,
and you tell me

1178
01:18:13,616 --> 01:18:17,446
who Samuel was
and what we were going through.

1179
01:18:18,116 --> 01:18:21,446
But what you say is just

1180
01:18:22,026 --> 01:18:25,026
a little part of the whole situation.

1181
01:18:25,576 --> 01:18:26,696
You know.

1182
01:18:27,276 --> 01:18:28,656
I mean, sometimes,

1183
01:18:29,326 --> 01:18:30,696
sometimes a couple...

1184
01:18:32,276 --> 01:18:34,116
is kind of a chaos

1185
01:18:34,276 --> 01:18:36,276
and everybody is lost.

1186
01:18:36,446 --> 01:18:39,236
Sometimes we fight together
and sometimes we fight alone,

1187
01:18:39,406 --> 01:18:42,656
and sometimes we fight against
each other, that happens.

1188
01:18:42,826 --> 01:18:45,826
And I think it's possible that Samuel

1189
01:18:46,156 --> 01:18:49,866
needed to see things
the way you describe them, but...

1190
01:18:51,406 --> 01:18:53,406
If I'd been seeing a therapist,

1191
01:18:53,576 --> 01:18:57,656
he could stand here too and say
very ugly things about Samuel.

1192
01:18:57,826 --> 01:18:59,826
But would those things be true?

1193
01:19:08,486 --> 01:19:12,736
Did you resent your husband
after your son's accident?

1194
01:19:16,276 --> 01:19:18,486
We were both dealing with

1195
01:19:18,656 --> 01:19:21,776
very different emotions at that time.

1196
01:19:23,116 --> 01:19:24,696
Yes or no?

1197
01:19:27,446 --> 01:19:29,026
Yes, for a few days.

1198
01:19:29,526 --> 01:19:31,406
Daniel was on his watch.

1199
01:19:32,576 --> 01:19:35,446
Your son practically lost his sight,

1200
01:19:35,826 --> 01:19:38,276
and you only resented him
for a few days?

1201
01:19:39,406 --> 01:19:42,776
Yes, about his responsibility
for the accident. Yes.

1202
01:19:43,696 --> 01:19:44,866
Of course.

1203
01:19:45,906 --> 01:19:50,986
I mean, maybe. The doctor earlier said
something about a tragic situation.

1204
01:19:51,406 --> 01:19:54,406
I immediately refused
to see it that way.

1205
01:19:54,776 --> 01:19:57,446
I never saw Daniel as handicapped.

1206
01:19:58,276 --> 01:20:01,616
You know, I wanted to protect
him from that perception.

1207
01:20:01,776 --> 01:20:05,446
Because, as soon as you mark a child
that way, you condemn him to now

1208
01:20:05,616 --> 01:20:08,366
to not see his life as his own,

1209
01:20:08,526 --> 01:20:11,236
whereas he should feel
that it's his best life

1210
01:20:11,406 --> 01:20:13,026
because it's the only life he's got,

1211
01:20:13,196 --> 01:20:14,526
it is his own.

1212
01:20:16,826 --> 01:20:18,196
He reads books,

1213
01:20:19,276 --> 01:20:21,736
he goes on social media
like any other kid

1214
01:20:21,906 --> 01:20:23,276
he plays the piano,

1215
01:20:23,446 --> 01:20:25,366
he dreams, he cries, he laughs.

1216
01:20:25,526 --> 01:20:27,526
He's a very lively kid.

1217
01:20:27,866 --> 01:20:29,076
He's OK.

1218
01:20:30,156 --> 01:20:31,326
Yeah.

1219
01:20:33,446 --> 01:20:35,736
So perhaps, I...

1220
01:20:37,366 --> 01:20:41,526
I resented Samuel for projecting
his own pain onto Daniel, yes.

1221
01:20:44,486 --> 01:20:45,486
Thank you.

1222
01:21:06,236 --> 01:21:08,366
I want to drink all night.

1223
01:21:09,696 --> 01:21:10,866
Yeah, same.

1224
01:21:11,696 --> 01:21:12,986
I will drink.

1225
01:21:13,736 --> 01:21:14,866
To forget.

1226
01:21:15,076 --> 01:21:17,156
Come on. You're the only lawyer...

1227
01:21:19,696 --> 01:21:20,946
OK, once again.

1228
01:21:21,116 --> 01:21:23,656
No, you're really
the only lawyer I know.

1229
01:21:25,116 --> 01:21:28,616
Is it a great reason for putting
your life in someone's hands?

1230
01:21:29,026 --> 01:21:30,906
- Is it?
- No, but you're good too.

1231
01:21:31,486 --> 01:21:33,076
Right? You're good.

1232
01:21:33,236 --> 01:21:34,696
- I don't know.
- Oh, come on.

1233
01:21:36,696 --> 01:21:38,196
You look like a dog.

1234
01:21:39,486 --> 01:21:40,656
Excuse me?

1235
01:21:40,826 --> 01:21:42,576
No, a beautiful dog.

1236
01:21:43,576 --> 01:21:44,906
How do you say it?

1237
01:21:45,946 --> 01:21:47,526
A basset?

1238
01:21:47,696 --> 01:21:49,826
Funny you say that.
I can't trust someone

1239
01:21:50,026 --> 01:21:52,406
if I can't put
an animal's head on them.

1240
01:21:52,616 --> 01:21:54,776
Really? So what am I?

1241
01:21:57,616 --> 01:21:59,076
I'm not sure yet.

1242
01:22:02,616 --> 01:22:04,026
After all this time,

1243
01:22:04,866 --> 01:22:06,366
you still don't know?

1244
01:22:08,776 --> 01:22:10,116
OK.

1245
01:22:21,736 --> 01:22:25,696
Do you remember me from before,
when we first met?

1246
01:22:26,236 --> 01:22:27,576
Yes I do, of course.

1247
01:22:28,326 --> 01:22:30,366
I don't. What was I like?

1248
01:22:32,366 --> 01:22:34,866
You were a little bit lost,

1249
01:22:35,696 --> 01:22:37,326
as I can remember.

1250
01:22:38,526 --> 01:22:39,576
Lonely.

1251
01:22:40,616 --> 01:22:41,696
And..

1252
01:22:42,946 --> 01:22:44,076
Ambitious.

1253
01:22:45,326 --> 01:22:47,736
And I was hopelessly in love.

1254
01:22:55,696 --> 01:22:57,196
I can't remember a thing.

1255
01:23:00,366 --> 01:23:01,696
OK.

1256
01:23:09,116 --> 01:23:11,406
But I'm innocent.
You know that, right?

1257
01:23:11,736 --> 01:23:13,026
Yes.

1258
01:23:13,366 --> 01:23:14,736
I mean really.

1259
01:23:17,906 --> 01:23:19,866
I don't know what you're thinking.

1260
01:23:22,486 --> 01:23:25,366
I think a lot of things
I don't tell you.

1261
01:23:25,826 --> 01:23:27,326
Otherwise you'd fire me right now.

1262
01:23:27,446 --> 01:23:28,446
No, Vincent.

1263
01:23:28,526 --> 01:23:30,526
In your head, you're thinking...

1264
01:23:30,696 --> 01:23:34,026
Sometimes when you look at me,
just like right now,

1265
01:23:34,406 --> 01:23:36,326
I can feel that you're judging me.

1266
01:23:37,826 --> 01:23:39,696
I don't know what you think.

1267
01:23:40,026 --> 01:23:42,026
Sandra, I believe you.

1268
01:23:42,736 --> 01:23:44,136
I'm not judging you.

1269
01:24:05,326 --> 01:24:06,366
My love,

1270
01:24:07,576 --> 01:24:08,906
I just want you to know...

1271
01:24:09,526 --> 01:24:10,616
I'm not...

1272
01:24:11,196 --> 01:24:14,576
I'm not that monster, you know?

1273
01:24:15,526 --> 01:24:17,906
Everything you hear in the trial,

1274
01:24:19,116 --> 01:24:20,576
it's just...

1275
01:24:22,026 --> 01:24:23,946
It's twisted. You know.

1276
01:24:24,826 --> 01:24:25,826
And...

1277
01:24:25,866 --> 01:24:27,696
It wasn't like that.

1278
01:24:28,276 --> 01:24:29,366
Your father...

1279
01:24:29,986 --> 01:24:32,236
Your father was my soulmate.

1280
01:24:32,866 --> 01:24:35,616
We chose each other, and I loved him.

1281
01:24:39,116 --> 01:24:40,986
But how do you prove that?

1282
01:24:46,866 --> 01:24:51,026
I just wish you would be shielded
from all this, that you could do...

1283
01:24:52,076 --> 01:24:55,446
that you could do children's stuff,

1284
01:24:56,156 --> 01:24:59,196
that you could be a child
just a little longer. You know.

1285
01:25:14,576 --> 01:25:15,866
All rise!

1286
01:25:24,526 --> 01:25:26,326
You may be seated.

1287
01:25:28,196 --> 01:25:32,776
We'll begin by calling the
Chief Investigator to the bar.

1288
01:25:37,576 --> 01:25:39,276
He insists, it's important.

1289
01:26:25,526 --> 01:26:27,326
You may be seated.

1290
01:26:29,486 --> 01:26:31,906
The Chief Investigator
has surely arrived,

1291
01:26:32,076 --> 01:26:34,276
so we'll start with him.

1292
01:26:35,326 --> 01:26:38,866
Clerk, please cue Exhibit 31.

1293
01:26:41,026 --> 01:26:44,116
Bailiff, prepare to hand out

1294
01:26:44,276 --> 01:26:47,986
the transcription
of the recording to the jurors.

1295
01:26:54,826 --> 01:26:56,116
Clerk?

1296
01:26:57,446 --> 01:26:59,576
What can I do?
It's part of the job.

1297
01:26:59,736 --> 01:27:01,776
Organize yourself differently.

1298
01:27:01,946 --> 01:27:03,196
I'm not going to cancel.

1299
01:27:03,366 --> 01:27:05,156
How can I organize on my own?

1300
01:27:05,526 --> 01:27:07,866
You know
we have to plan things together.

1301
01:27:10,736 --> 01:27:13,156
I won't leave Daniel alone
because you're gone.

1302
01:27:13,326 --> 01:27:15,526
Leave him with Monica,
what's the big deal?

1303
01:27:16,406 --> 01:27:17,406
Three days a week?

1304
01:27:17,576 --> 01:27:19,196
We'd have to pay her for that.

1305
01:27:19,366 --> 01:27:20,906
We can't afford it.

1306
01:27:23,776 --> 01:27:25,236
I need time.

1307
01:27:25,446 --> 01:27:27,326
Not just a few hours.

1308
01:27:27,946 --> 01:27:30,656
I'm talking about blocking out time
for myself for the whole year.

1309
01:27:31,736 --> 01:27:33,486
This isn't working for me anymore.

1310
01:27:37,696 --> 01:27:40,366
Organize your time differently,
it's up to you.

1311
01:27:40,526 --> 01:27:43,196
When's the last time
you helped him do his homework?

1312
01:27:43,406 --> 01:27:47,076
So many things you don't care about.
That's the time I mean.

1313
01:27:48,196 --> 01:27:51,826
Darling, the book just came out.
You know it's just this time.

1314
01:27:51,986 --> 01:27:54,486
It's always "just this time".

1315
01:27:56,616 --> 01:27:59,776
Whether you have a book out,
or you're writing,

1316
01:27:59,946 --> 01:28:03,026
or you need space
to figure out what to write.

1317
01:28:05,366 --> 01:28:08,026
I've been following
your lead for years!

1318
01:28:08,906 --> 01:28:10,986
I can't do anything with my time.

1319
01:28:11,526 --> 01:28:12,596
Do you understand?

1320
01:28:16,486 --> 01:28:18,866
It's not my time, it's yours!

1321
01:28:23,366 --> 01:28:26,156
Do I force you to teach?

1322
01:28:27,906 --> 01:28:30,866
Do I force you
to homeschool Daniel?

1323
01:28:31,616 --> 01:28:33,116
No one's forcing you.

1324
01:28:33,526 --> 01:28:35,906
If you want more time,
I've never stopped you.

1325
01:28:36,076 --> 01:28:37,526
Are you fucking serious?

1326
01:28:38,486 --> 01:28:41,156
I cut my course load in half
to gain more time

1327
01:28:41,326 --> 01:28:42,826
and it's still not enough.

1328
01:28:42,986 --> 01:28:45,826
I have to finish the renovation,
and I'm dealing with everything else!

1329
01:28:48,276 --> 01:28:50,736
Why do you refuse to talk about it?

1330
01:28:50,906 --> 01:28:54,526
Why can't you just admit it has to do
with how things are divided between us?

1331
01:28:54,696 --> 01:28:55,866
Because you're wrong.

1332
01:28:56,026 --> 01:28:58,776
I don't owe you any time.
I do my part.

1333
01:28:59,366 --> 01:29:02,366
Come on, let's not
take inventory here, please.

1334
01:29:03,526 --> 01:29:04,736
Let's relax.

1335
01:29:11,526 --> 01:29:12,736
I love you.

1336
01:29:19,526 --> 01:29:22,236
When you decided
to homeschool Daniel,

1337
01:29:22,466 --> 01:29:24,126
I told you be careful.

1338
01:29:24,826 --> 01:29:27,446
It's a beautiful, generous choice.
I thank you for it,

1339
01:29:27,616 --> 01:29:30,366
but you don't have to.
I told you it would force you...

1340
01:29:30,526 --> 01:29:33,736
What?
To spend more time with my son?

1341
01:29:35,366 --> 01:29:36,656
I'm glad I did.

1342
01:29:37,866 --> 01:29:40,986
I wouldn't have the relationship
I have with him today if I didn't.

1343
01:29:44,076 --> 01:29:47,076
The relationship
I don't have with him, you mean?

1344
01:29:47,236 --> 01:29:49,236
I didn't say that, no.

1345
01:29:53,826 --> 01:29:55,196
I'm saying maybe,

1346
01:29:57,026 --> 01:30:00,196
just maybe, things are a little
out of balance between us.

1347
01:30:00,366 --> 01:30:03,026
I want you to look at that.
Why is this so hard to discuss?

1348
01:30:03,196 --> 01:30:05,826
I don't believe in the notion
of reciprocity in a couple.

1349
01:30:05,986 --> 01:30:07,776
It's naïve and frankly, depressing.

1350
01:30:08,656 --> 01:30:12,326
Yes. And I think
discussing it is a waste of time,

1351
01:30:12,486 --> 01:30:14,736
considering the state
you're in. Seriously.

1352
01:30:15,696 --> 01:30:18,156
All this blah-blah-blah,
and more time is gone.

1353
01:30:19,276 --> 01:30:20,776
All this time spent chitchatting

1354
01:30:20,946 --> 01:30:23,406
could be spent in silence
doing whatever you want to do,

1355
01:30:23,576 --> 01:30:24,946
if only you knew.

1356
01:30:25,156 --> 01:30:27,946
I want time to start writing,
same as you.

1357
01:30:28,696 --> 01:30:29,696
Do it.

1358
01:30:29,776 --> 01:30:33,156
Writers don't stop writing
because they have a son and chores.

1359
01:30:33,326 --> 01:30:35,736
Stop whining about
your scheduling bullshit

1360
01:30:35,906 --> 01:30:39,656
and stop blaming me
for what you did or didn't do.

1361
01:30:39,826 --> 01:30:42,776
I live with you.
I plan my life around you.

1362
01:30:44,236 --> 01:30:47,076
If I imposed on you
what you're imposing on me,

1363
01:30:47,776 --> 01:30:49,526
neither of us would be able to write.

1364
01:30:49,696 --> 01:30:52,076
Don't worry about me,
I always manage to write.

1365
01:30:52,576 --> 01:30:53,696
Great.

1366
01:30:54,406 --> 01:30:55,406
Perfect.

1367
01:30:55,446 --> 01:30:57,446
If you're so sure of yourself, adapt.

1368
01:30:57,676 --> 01:31:00,046
I do adapt.
I take Daniel to school.

1369
01:31:00,366 --> 01:31:02,616
- Once a week.
- We have Monica on Tuesdays, come on.

1370
01:31:02,776 --> 01:31:04,486
Sandra, don't be dishonest.

1371
01:31:04,556 --> 01:31:07,096
- I'm not. You're the one nitpicking.
- I've given you too much.

1372
01:31:07,176 --> 01:31:09,546
Too much time,
too many concessions.

1373
01:31:09,696 --> 01:31:11,406
I want this time back.

1374
01:31:11,576 --> 01:31:13,276
And you owe it to me. Be fair!

1375
01:31:13,506 --> 01:31:15,756
I'm sorry, but no.
Are you insane?

1376
01:31:15,906 --> 01:31:17,366
I don't owe you anything.

1377
01:31:17,826 --> 01:31:18,826
Really.

1378
01:31:18,986 --> 01:31:20,946
This is about your relationship
with your son.

1379
01:31:21,016 --> 01:31:22,656
And to protect
yourself and your comfort,

1380
01:31:22,706 --> 01:31:25,406
because you got scared and
put yourself in that position.

1381
01:31:25,616 --> 01:31:29,116
It was your choice to come here
and start this renovation.

1382
01:31:29,276 --> 01:31:31,326
This is your own trap!

1383
01:31:32,196 --> 01:31:36,026
I don't take your time,
you waste it all on your own!

1384
01:31:36,236 --> 01:31:38,026
I want things to change now.

1385
01:31:38,196 --> 01:31:40,406
I want time to start writing again.

1386
01:31:40,576 --> 01:31:41,776
Great, go for it.

1387
01:31:42,486 --> 01:31:45,236
If you want my advice,
go back to the one you ditched.

1388
01:31:46,236 --> 01:31:49,526
That's your advice?
Go back to the book you plundered?

1389
01:31:50,326 --> 01:31:52,026
So now it's plundering.

1390
01:31:52,196 --> 01:31:54,366
We've discussed it.
You'd given up.

1391
01:31:55,796 --> 01:31:59,836
You took the book's best idea.
How am I supposed to go back to it?

1392
01:32:00,196 --> 01:32:02,156
Do you realize
how cynical that is of you?

1393
01:32:02,366 --> 01:32:04,826
Publish your own version,
say it inspired me,

1394
01:32:04,986 --> 01:32:06,156
I'll admit to it.

1395
01:32:06,616 --> 01:32:10,116
If something needs to be written,
someone has to write it. You know.

1396
01:32:10,326 --> 01:32:13,366
You have animal vision.
You pretend to be obliging, but...

1397
01:32:13,596 --> 01:32:17,386
Look at you.
Even your bullshit moralizing...

1398
01:32:17,526 --> 01:32:21,236
And this, really, is a way
for you to waste more time.

1399
01:32:21,406 --> 01:32:23,616
You should be flattered
that I was inspired by you.

1400
01:32:23,776 --> 01:32:26,026
This is life, things circulate.

1401
01:32:26,196 --> 01:32:27,366
Yes.

1402
01:32:28,196 --> 01:32:31,326
And frankly, I wish
you'd be inspired to plunder me.

1403
01:32:31,486 --> 01:32:34,116
You're not alone in your jungle,
but you impose everything.

1404
01:32:34,326 --> 01:32:37,116
You impose your rhythm,
your use of time,

1405
01:32:37,576 --> 01:32:38,616
even your language.

1406
01:32:38,776 --> 01:32:41,866
Even with language,
I meet you on your turf.

1407
01:32:42,026 --> 01:32:43,616
We speak English at home.

1408
01:32:43,776 --> 01:32:45,986
I'm not on my turf,
I don't speak my mother tongue.

1409
01:32:46,196 --> 01:32:48,446
Nor mine, though we live here.

1410
01:32:48,616 --> 01:32:50,866
Yes, it's a middle ground, in fact.

1411
01:32:51,616 --> 01:32:54,116
Because I'm not French,
you're not German.

1412
01:32:54,276 --> 01:32:57,576
We create a middle ground, so nobody
has to go to the other's turf.

1413
01:32:57,736 --> 01:33:01,576
This is what English is for.
Don't blame me for that.

1414
01:33:01,736 --> 01:33:04,736
But we live in France.
That's our reality.

1415
01:33:04,966 --> 01:33:07,856
Daniel hears you speak a language
that has nothing to do wife, his life,

1416
01:33:07,906 --> 01:33:11,196
just because you impose it on him,
like everything else.

1417
01:33:11,366 --> 01:33:13,276
We're on your turf, all the time.

1418
01:33:13,506 --> 01:33:15,046
Your country!

1419
01:33:15,826 --> 01:33:20,406
Every single day I have to accept
that we live in your hometown!

1420
01:33:20,826 --> 01:33:23,026
The people you grew up with
look down on me

1421
01:33:23,196 --> 01:33:26,116
whenever I don't make the effort
to smile at them.

1422
01:33:27,366 --> 01:33:30,906
You don't think me living here
counts as meeting you on your turf?

1423
01:33:31,696 --> 01:33:33,576
You never smile at anyone.

1424
01:33:34,616 --> 01:33:36,446
That's why you love me, right?

1425
01:33:36,616 --> 01:33:40,076
Because, if you wanted a stupid
bitch who grins at your friends,

1426
01:33:40,236 --> 01:33:42,236
you'd have picked someone else.

1427
01:33:47,196 --> 01:33:48,576
You really have no shame.

1428
01:33:48,736 --> 01:33:50,196
That's a superpower.

1429
01:33:50,366 --> 01:33:52,156
You see no one but yourself.

1430
01:33:52,326 --> 01:33:55,236
I see you very clearly,
just not as a victim.

1431
01:33:56,156 --> 01:33:57,196
You impose

1432
01:33:57,426 --> 01:34:01,006
your way of living, speaking, eating,

1433
01:34:01,216 --> 01:34:02,136
even fucking.

1434
01:34:02,196 --> 01:34:04,776
I could never get you to fuck
any other way.

1435
01:34:04,946 --> 01:34:07,866
Because you expect me to follow your
lead, that's your notion of a couple.

1436
01:34:07,986 --> 01:34:09,946
I don't believe it;
I don't believe it...

1437
01:34:10,116 --> 01:34:13,986
I don't have a notion, I don't
give a fuck about couples. Really.

1438
01:34:17,026 --> 01:34:19,366
So, you say I'm stopping you

1439
01:34:19,526 --> 01:34:21,696
from fucking the way you want.

1440
01:34:22,076 --> 01:34:23,486
- Seriously?
- Yes.

1441
01:34:23,866 --> 01:34:26,406
Who's been refusing
to fuck since the accident?

1442
01:34:26,576 --> 01:34:28,026
You know I meant before.

1443
01:34:28,196 --> 01:34:31,406
What did I ever
refuse to do sexually?

1444
01:34:34,196 --> 01:34:35,326
Everything.

1445
01:34:37,026 --> 01:34:39,826
Everything plus I have to accept
that you fuck other people.

1446
01:34:40,056 --> 01:34:41,676
I do not fuck other people.

1447
01:34:41,826 --> 01:34:42,826
Don't deny it.

1448
01:34:42,986 --> 01:34:46,326
Once, and you cling to it
in order to suffer!

1449
01:34:46,486 --> 01:34:49,446
- You cheated several times.
- You make yourself the victim!

1450
01:34:49,616 --> 01:34:52,406
I'm not a victim,
I'm a man who's been cheated on!

1451
01:34:52,576 --> 01:34:54,076
Plundered and cheated on.

1452
01:34:58,986 --> 01:35:02,196
I can live without sex,
but not forever.

1453
01:35:03,236 --> 01:35:05,736
So you blame me?
I'm the one frustrating you?

1454
01:35:05,966 --> 01:35:08,166
It's not about who's...

1455
01:35:08,866 --> 01:35:11,326
who's blaming who
or who's frustrating who.

1456
01:35:11,486 --> 01:35:13,986
The frustration is there
and we're both dealing with it.

1457
01:35:14,906 --> 01:35:18,276
Me personally
I refuse to rot inside,

1458
01:35:18,506 --> 01:35:19,546
so I find solutions.

1459
01:35:19,696 --> 01:35:22,776
At this point, sex was a question
of personal hygiene!

1460
01:35:23,236 --> 01:35:26,866
But you impose your solutions,
which are solutions for you only.

1461
01:35:27,026 --> 01:35:29,236
You don't give a shit
if it hurts me and Daniel.

1462
01:35:29,406 --> 01:35:32,236
You leave Daniel out of this.
This is not about him.

1463
01:35:32,406 --> 01:35:34,026
I do not impose anything on him.

1464
01:35:34,196 --> 01:35:36,196
You made us live here
among the goats.

1465
01:35:36,366 --> 01:35:38,526
You complain
about the life you chose!

1466
01:35:38,696 --> 01:35:40,276
You're not a victim.

1467
01:35:40,616 --> 01:35:42,366
Not at all!

1468
01:35:42,526 --> 01:35:46,236
Your generosity conceals
something dirtier and meaner.

1469
01:35:47,406 --> 01:35:50,326
You're incapable of facing
your ambitions and resent me for it.

1470
01:35:50,486 --> 01:35:54,616
But I didn't put you where you are.
I've nothing to do with it!

1471
01:35:55,026 --> 01:35:57,576
You're not sacrificing yourself,
as you say.

1472
01:35:57,736 --> 01:36:01,116
You choose to sit on the sidelines
because you're afraid!

1473
01:36:01,276 --> 01:36:03,156
Your pride makes your head explode

1474
01:36:03,326 --> 01:36:06,366
before you can even come up
with a germ of an idea!

1475
01:36:06,526 --> 01:36:09,156
You wake up at 40
needing someone to blame.

1476
01:36:09,326 --> 01:36:10,776
You're the one to blame!

1477
01:36:13,196 --> 01:36:15,866
You're petrified
by your own fucking standards

1478
01:36:16,026 --> 01:36:17,326
and fear of failure.

1479
01:36:17,486 --> 01:36:18,776
This is the truth.

1480
01:36:18,946 --> 01:36:21,236
You're smart.
I know you know I'm right.

1481
01:36:21,466 --> 01:36:24,546
And Daniel has nothing to do with it.
Stop it!

1482
01:36:29,276 --> 01:36:30,696
You're a monster.

1483
01:36:32,116 --> 01:36:34,236
Even Daniel says it,
with his own words.

1484
01:36:34,406 --> 01:36:36,526
Take that back,
you piece of shit.

1485
01:36:36,696 --> 01:36:39,526
He's told me countless times
how hard you are.

1486
01:36:39,696 --> 01:36:41,736
He's telling you
what you want to hear.

1487
01:36:41,906 --> 01:36:44,866
He can feel your guilt
and he's trying to reassure you,

1488
01:36:45,096 --> 01:36:46,466
don't you see that?

1489
01:36:46,616 --> 01:36:49,116
You've never stopped
feeling guilty about him!

1490
01:36:49,346 --> 01:36:50,596
You're cold-hearted.

1491
01:36:50,736 --> 01:36:51,826
You have no pity.

1492
01:36:51,986 --> 01:36:53,656
And you have
way too much for yourself.

1493
01:36:53,826 --> 01:36:56,736
I can't stand any more
of your fucking ice!

1494
01:36:59,196 --> 01:37:00,826
- You're violent!
- Yes, I am!

1495
01:37:29,616 --> 01:37:30,866
So...

1496
01:37:31,406 --> 01:37:34,986
Can you tell us
where you found this recording?

1497
01:37:36,906 --> 01:37:39,576
On a USB key belonging to the victim.

1498
01:37:39,736 --> 01:37:43,986
He made several dozen recordings
on his cellphone.

1499
01:37:44,736 --> 01:37:48,616
For 6 months, he'd been recording
moments from, his life.

1500
01:37:48,776 --> 01:37:50,656
For a literary project, apparently.

1501
01:37:50,866 --> 01:37:53,026
Did he transcribe all the recordings?

1502
01:37:53,196 --> 01:37:55,236
Yes, except this last argument.

1503
01:37:56,026 --> 01:37:59,616
Does your investigation link
this argument to his death?

1504
01:37:59,776 --> 01:38:03,406
Yes. They occurred 20 hours apart
and have common themes.

1505
01:38:03,576 --> 01:38:05,446
He criticizes her infidelity.

1506
01:38:05,616 --> 01:38:08,026
A pretty girl comes the next day.

1507
01:38:08,366 --> 01:38:10,776
A literature student,

1508
01:38:10,946 --> 01:38:13,906
to interview Sandra Voyter
about her books.

1509
01:38:14,696 --> 01:38:17,196
There must've been
tension in the air.

1510
01:38:17,366 --> 01:38:18,576
The two women

1511
01:38:18,776 --> 01:38:22,866
were enjoying themselves
while he worked hard upstairs.

1512
01:38:24,236 --> 01:38:28,076
The argument can be seen as
a dress rehearsal for the next day.

1513
01:38:28,236 --> 01:38:32,616
How do you interpret
the violent outbursts?

1514
01:38:33,076 --> 01:38:34,616
We hear blows.

1515
01:38:35,406 --> 01:38:38,656
A physical altercation,
the accused striking her husband.

1516
01:38:38,826 --> 01:38:42,446
What makes it possible for you
to reach that conclusion?

1517
01:38:43,326 --> 01:38:46,076
She seems to be
in a more intense state of rage.

1518
01:38:49,196 --> 01:38:51,946
- Sorry?
- Speak directly to the court.

1519
01:38:52,116 --> 01:38:55,486
She's clearly
in a more intense state of rage.

1520
01:38:56,986 --> 01:39:01,576
Her shouts at the end of the audio
are the last step

1521
01:39:01,736 --> 01:39:04,156
before the violence gets physical.

1522
01:39:04,576 --> 01:39:08,076
The confusion that follows
is hard to analyze, but...

1523
01:39:08,486 --> 01:39:11,616
we hear blows to a body or a face,

1524
01:39:11,776 --> 01:39:14,446
and the muffled screams we hear

1525
01:39:14,616 --> 01:39:16,276
are Mr. Maleski's.

1526
01:39:16,446 --> 01:39:18,656
You mentioned
bruises on Mrs Voyter.

1527
01:39:18,826 --> 01:39:21,026
Show Exhibit 9, please.

1528
01:39:21,776 --> 01:39:25,116
This photo was taken
on the day her husband died.

1529
01:39:25,446 --> 01:39:26,866
How did she explain it?

1530
01:39:27,026 --> 01:39:30,736
She initially told us
she'd bumped into a kitchen counter.

1531
01:39:31,366 --> 01:39:34,446
We pointed out that the bruising
was around her wrist,

1532
01:39:34,656 --> 01:39:37,696
and looked a lot
like signs of a struggle.

1533
01:39:38,406 --> 01:39:41,026
Later, when we played her
the recording,

1534
01:39:41,196 --> 01:39:43,776
she admitted it had happened then,

1535
01:39:44,276 --> 01:39:45,946
during their brief struggle.

1536
01:39:46,116 --> 01:39:48,026
So you admit you lied?

1537
01:39:48,946 --> 01:39:50,076
Yes.

1538
01:39:50,696 --> 01:39:51,946
Because..

1539
01:39:52,276 --> 01:39:56,196
I was afraid
that if I mentioned it,

1540
01:39:57,116 --> 01:40:00,076
I knew it would make me a suspect
and I got scared.

1541
01:40:00,236 --> 01:40:03,156
And you didn't know
he'd recorded the fight.

1542
01:40:03,326 --> 01:40:04,656
So you lied twice.

1543
01:40:04,826 --> 01:40:08,366
About the bruises,
and by not mentioning the fight.

1544
01:40:08,526 --> 01:40:11,196
For me, it was just one lie.

1545
01:40:11,366 --> 01:40:15,526
Because, if I'd been honest about the
bruises, I'd have mentioned the argument.

1546
01:40:15,946 --> 01:40:18,366
I didn't want to be seen as guilty.

1547
01:40:18,576 --> 01:40:20,446
As no guilty person ever does.

1548
01:40:20,616 --> 01:40:23,026
Can we time the bruises exactly?

1549
01:40:23,196 --> 01:40:25,526
The doctor examined her
the following day.

1550
01:40:26,326 --> 01:40:30,576
It was too late to determine exactly
when they occurred.

1551
01:40:30,776 --> 01:40:32,326
So it's possible

1552
01:40:32,486 --> 01:40:36,406
a second fight caused the bruises
on the day Mr. Maleski died.

1553
01:40:45,776 --> 01:40:48,776
What do we hear
at the end of the argument?

1554
01:40:49,526 --> 01:40:51,776
The first sound of breaking glass

1555
01:40:51,946 --> 01:40:54,406
is me throwing a glass
against the wall.

1556
01:40:54,576 --> 01:40:57,116
A wine glass that was on the table.

1557
01:40:57,906 --> 01:41:02,366
After that, I went over to my husband
and I slapped him.

1558
01:41:02,986 --> 01:41:06,196
That's when he grabbed my wrist,
quite violently.

1559
01:41:06,366 --> 01:41:08,526
That's the struggling we can hear.

1560
01:41:09,116 --> 01:41:13,486
Just after, I tried to stop him from
throwing picture frames to the floor

1561
01:41:13,656 --> 01:41:15,696
but I couldn't,
so we hear them shattering.

1562
01:41:16,406 --> 01:41:18,526
Aside from that slap,
did you hit him?

1563
01:41:19,076 --> 01:41:20,196
No.

1564
01:41:21,526 --> 01:41:22,866
What we hear next

1565
01:41:23,026 --> 01:41:27,406
is Samuel repeatedly hitting himself
in the face and the head,

1566
01:41:28,076 --> 01:41:30,576
and then punching the wall.

1567
01:41:30,736 --> 01:41:32,576
You can still see the dent.

1568
01:41:33,366 --> 01:41:37,326
There are a few around the house,
it's not the first time he did that.

1569
01:41:37,866 --> 01:41:41,156
Years ago, he already broke a finger

1570
01:41:41,656 --> 01:41:44,026
punching the wall during an episode.

1571
01:41:46,076 --> 01:41:48,486
We have photos
of those dents in the wall.

1572
01:41:48,656 --> 01:41:49,656
Thank you.

1573
01:41:49,846 --> 01:41:50,596
Here.

1574
01:41:50,736 --> 01:41:52,986
And the X-ray
of his fractured finger,

1575
01:41:53,196 --> 01:41:56,826
taken in June 2017
at the hospital in Grenoble.

1576
01:41:58,056 --> 01:41:59,346
Is it fair to say

1577
01:41:59,486 --> 01:42:04,326
your depiction of the violence
is interpretive and not objective?

1578
01:42:06,116 --> 01:42:08,776
She repeatedly lied to us,
so believing her...

1579
01:42:08,986 --> 01:42:10,826
Thus, this is about believing,

1580
01:42:10,986 --> 01:42:12,366
or not believing.

1581
01:42:12,696 --> 01:42:14,576
It's a subjective opinion,

1582
01:42:14,736 --> 01:42:16,986
based on an ambiguous recording.

1583
01:42:17,946 --> 01:42:20,826
You link the argument
of the day of the death.

1584
01:42:20,986 --> 01:42:23,696
You call it a "dress rehearsal".

1585
01:42:23,866 --> 01:42:25,656
Do you have any direct proof?

1586
01:42:25,826 --> 01:42:28,866
The recording
is direct proof of a fight.

1587
01:42:29,026 --> 01:42:30,826
I mean the day of the death.

1588
01:42:31,986 --> 01:42:35,236
With no witnesses or confessions,
we must interpret.

1589
01:42:37,866 --> 01:42:40,986
In fact, this violent fight is...

1590
01:42:41,156 --> 01:42:44,236
phantasmal.
It exists only as fantasy.

1591
01:42:44,866 --> 01:42:46,326
You float the idea,

1592
01:42:46,486 --> 01:42:48,156
the prosecutor floats it,

1593
01:42:48,326 --> 01:42:51,116
over or around the facts,

1594
01:42:51,276 --> 01:42:54,616
making it omnipresent
here in court, but...

1595
01:42:56,446 --> 01:42:59,616
We risk turning this fantasy
into a reality

1596
01:42:59,776 --> 01:43:03,116
simply because
there was indeed a fight

1597
01:43:03,486 --> 01:43:06,196
the day before Mr. Maleski died.

1598
01:43:06,736 --> 01:43:10,616
Don't substitute the day before
for the next day.

1599
01:43:11,826 --> 01:43:15,486
We can't fill the blanks
with a supposition,

1600
01:43:15,656 --> 01:43:19,406
simply because we have sounds
for one and not the other.

1601
01:43:19,576 --> 01:43:20,576
Mrs Voyter,

1602
01:43:20,656 --> 01:43:24,446
did you know he'd recorded
you before you were told?

1603
01:43:26,156 --> 01:43:29,736
No, but I knew that he often recorded
moments of our lives.

1604
01:43:29,946 --> 01:43:32,236
He didn't always let you know?

1605
01:43:32,406 --> 01:43:34,656
What were these recordings?

1606
01:43:35,736 --> 01:43:37,616
At first, he would mention it.

1607
01:43:37,776 --> 01:43:40,446
After a while,
he did it without us knowing.

1608
01:43:40,616 --> 01:43:43,326
He recorded conversations,

1609
01:43:43,486 --> 01:43:45,486
Daniel's piano lessons,

1610
01:43:45,656 --> 01:43:49,236
and sometimes just himself,
talking to himself.

1611
01:43:49,406 --> 01:43:53,986
I think he wanted to gather material
to help him start writing again.

1612
01:43:55,196 --> 01:43:58,526
Now, with hindsight,
it seems possible

1613
01:43:58,696 --> 01:44:01,986
that he could have provoked
this fight just to record it.

1614
01:44:02,326 --> 01:44:06,526
Wait, are you implying
you're the victim of a twisted man?

1615
01:44:06,696 --> 01:44:07,866
Seriously?

1616
01:44:08,406 --> 01:44:11,826
He recorded her in secret.
It's a valid question.

1617
01:44:11,986 --> 01:44:14,576
You forget the situation is perverse.

1618
01:44:15,406 --> 01:44:16,696
Now the victim is on trial!

1619
01:44:16,866 --> 01:44:18,776
No, but my client has a point.

1620
01:44:18,946 --> 01:44:22,236
Can you explain
what he means by cheating,

1621
01:44:22,406 --> 01:44:23,736
and how he found out?

1622
01:44:26,076 --> 01:44:29,076
He went through my phone
and discovered messages

1623
01:44:29,236 --> 01:44:31,946
from a woman I'd met
at the beginning of that year.

1624
01:44:32,116 --> 01:44:34,326
What do you mean by "met"?

1625
01:44:34,736 --> 01:44:37,076
It was sexual,
we slept together twice.

1626
01:44:37,236 --> 01:44:38,236
Twice?

1627
01:44:38,276 --> 01:44:39,276
Yes.

1628
01:44:39,446 --> 01:44:42,076
On the recording you said once.

1629
01:44:42,986 --> 01:44:45,326
It meant with just one person.

1630
01:44:46,026 --> 01:44:47,326
Hang on...

1631
01:44:47,826 --> 01:44:51,326
Samuel mentions
numerous affairs in the past.

1632
01:44:51,486 --> 01:44:54,156
It sounds like
you cheated constantly.

1633
01:44:54,366 --> 01:44:55,986
That's not true.

1634
01:44:56,526 --> 01:45:00,076
I had a few flings
the year of Daniel's accident.

1635
01:45:00,236 --> 01:45:02,486
It wasn't cheating,
because Samuel knew.

1636
01:45:02,656 --> 01:45:04,196
He found out each time?

1637
01:45:04,526 --> 01:45:06,076
No, I told him.

1638
01:45:06,736 --> 01:45:08,326
It was a tricky year.

1639
01:45:08,486 --> 01:45:10,736
You want us to believe
he agreed to it?

1640
01:45:11,366 --> 01:45:15,326
I'm not saying that,
I'm saying I was honest about it.

1641
01:45:16,076 --> 01:45:17,776
Interesting take on honesty.

1642
01:45:17,946 --> 01:45:21,236
But the year he died
you quit being honest, why?

1643
01:45:24,406 --> 01:45:25,906
Things were different.

1644
01:45:26,076 --> 01:45:29,526
I felt that it would hurt him
too much at that time.

1645
01:45:29,696 --> 01:45:32,616
Because you had feelings
for that woman?

1646
01:45:32,776 --> 01:45:35,616
No, I felt it would hurt him
because he was fragile.

1647
01:45:35,776 --> 01:45:37,276
And...

1648
01:45:37,446 --> 01:45:40,406
As I said,
with her it was just sexual.

1649
01:45:40,576 --> 01:45:43,366
The person I had feelings for
was Samuel.

1650
01:45:43,526 --> 01:45:45,406
Interesting take on feelings.

1651
01:45:45,576 --> 01:45:46,906
I'm trying to understand.

1652
01:45:47,076 --> 01:45:50,276
At first you agreed
on an open relationship,

1653
01:45:50,446 --> 01:45:52,156
then that changed?

1654
01:45:53,326 --> 01:45:56,236
I don't even know
what that means, I'm sorry.

1655
01:45:56,406 --> 01:45:59,866
Sorry. No, we never had
that kind of agreement.

1656
01:46:00,026 --> 01:46:04,366
After the accident,
we were both trying to feel better.

1657
01:46:04,526 --> 01:46:06,696
I needed that to keep it together,

1658
01:46:06,906 --> 01:46:08,076
and I was honest.

1659
01:46:08,236 --> 01:46:11,576
But then you quit being honest,
and he held you accountable.

1660
01:46:11,736 --> 01:46:14,156
He doesn't sound "fragile".

1661
01:46:14,326 --> 01:46:16,696
- Do you admit he was jealous?
- Yes.

1662
01:46:16,866 --> 01:46:18,776
OK. Had he become obsessed?

1663
01:46:18,986 --> 01:46:20,656
No. I don't know...

1664
01:46:21,076 --> 01:46:23,196
He was hurt, that's true.

1665
01:46:24,616 --> 01:46:26,866
Sometimes when we fought
he brought it up.

1666
01:46:27,026 --> 01:46:29,526
But he didn't think about it
all the time.

1667
01:46:30,026 --> 01:46:34,076
According to your logic,
all Samuel's problems were my fault.

1668
01:46:34,236 --> 01:46:37,076
That's not true.
His pain came from a deeper place.

1669
01:46:37,276 --> 01:46:41,486
According to "his" logic
you're to blame, as we heard.

1670
01:46:41,656 --> 01:46:45,026
What does he mean when he says
his work was plundered?

1671
01:46:45,236 --> 01:46:48,326
No, there wasn't any plundering.

1672
01:46:48,486 --> 01:46:52,696
In the book that he abandoned,
there was an interesting passage...

1673
01:46:52,866 --> 01:46:54,656
A passage?
How many pages?

1674
01:46:54,986 --> 01:46:56,026
About 20.

1675
01:46:56,236 --> 01:46:57,366
27.

1676
01:46:58,156 --> 01:47:01,526
It was just a rough outline.
I thought the idea was brilliant.

1677
01:47:01,696 --> 01:47:02,826
Can you summarize it?

1678
01:47:02,986 --> 01:47:05,576
Must we enter into a literary debate?

1679
01:47:05,736 --> 01:47:07,736
This isn't literary, it's concrete.

1680
01:47:07,946 --> 01:47:09,696
It's the heart of their conflict.

1681
01:47:10,026 --> 01:47:13,276
I don't know how else
to present it to the jurors.

1682
01:47:13,446 --> 01:47:14,446
Nor do I.

1683
01:47:14,576 --> 01:47:15,616
Proceed.

1684
01:47:15,776 --> 01:47:16,946
Well...

1685
01:47:17,116 --> 01:47:20,116
It was about a guy imagining
how his life would've been

1686
01:47:20,276 --> 01:47:22,656
without the accident
that killed his brother.

1687
01:47:22,986 --> 01:47:25,826
He wakes up and finds himself
in two different realities.

1688
01:47:25,986 --> 01:47:27,986
In one, the accident
is the center of his life.

1689
01:47:28,156 --> 01:47:30,196
In the other, it never happened.

1690
01:47:30,366 --> 01:47:32,826
I told Samuel I loved it.

1691
01:47:32,986 --> 01:47:36,116
He had me read
everything he wrote back then.

1692
01:47:36,446 --> 01:47:39,696
Soon after,
he abandoned the whole book.

1693
01:47:39,866 --> 01:47:42,616
I asked him if I could use the idea
and he said yes.

1694
01:47:42,826 --> 01:47:43,866
No.

1695
01:47:44,526 --> 01:47:47,196
He couldn't have,
he calls it plundering.

1696
01:47:47,366 --> 01:47:49,196
It's an argument.

1697
01:47:49,366 --> 01:47:52,616
People exaggerate and alter facts
when they argue.

1698
01:47:52,776 --> 01:47:55,576
It's no exaggeration to say his
book became yours: "ECLIPSE".

1699
01:47:59,906 --> 01:48:03,616
All I took was this idea.

1700
01:48:03,776 --> 01:48:06,366
My characters are a woman
and her daughter,

1701
01:48:06,526 --> 01:48:07,696
and I developed the story

1702
01:48:07,906 --> 01:48:09,736
over 300 pages.

1703
01:48:11,866 --> 01:48:16,116
I can't believe I must tell you what's the
difference between an outline and a novel?

1704
01:48:16,276 --> 01:48:17,616
He agreed to it.

1705
01:48:17,776 --> 01:48:21,986
And when he read it, he said
I did something very different.

1706
01:48:22,156 --> 01:48:25,906
Sometimes yes, when we argued
it came out, because...

1707
01:48:26,076 --> 01:48:28,826
he was upset
because he couldn't write.

1708
01:48:29,026 --> 01:48:32,776
The only thing we know for sure
is that "it came out".

1709
01:48:32,946 --> 01:48:34,656
Did the two of you...

1710
01:48:35,236 --> 01:48:38,196
argue again
before the time of his death?

1711
01:48:38,366 --> 01:48:40,446
It must've been very tense.

1712
01:48:43,156 --> 01:48:44,236
We were...

1713
01:48:45,486 --> 01:48:47,236
we were both really shaken.

1714
01:48:47,406 --> 01:48:50,826
We were both keeping to ourselves
and Samuel was...

1715
01:48:52,076 --> 01:48:53,616
I don't know, something was gone.

1716
01:48:53,776 --> 01:48:56,576
He was depleted,
his energy was just gone.

1717
01:48:56,736 --> 01:49:00,156
In the audio, I hear Samuel Maleski
arguing strenuously.

1718
01:49:00,326 --> 01:49:03,616
I hear a man determined
to regain control of his life.

1719
01:49:03,776 --> 01:49:06,736
In no way
a man who has decided to give up.

1720
01:49:06,906 --> 01:49:11,446
Samuel's psychiatrist said he was
combative in their last sessions.

1721
01:49:11,616 --> 01:49:16,236
Do you kill yourself after fighting
for time and self-esteem?

1722
01:49:16,406 --> 01:49:20,946
Do you kill yourself after pleading
so fiercely and energetically

1723
01:49:21,116 --> 01:49:24,616
for balance and justice
in your relationship? No.

1724
01:49:25,616 --> 01:49:28,406
That's the main flaw
in the suicide theory.

1725
01:49:28,576 --> 01:49:31,776
You say he seemed "depleted".

1726
01:49:31,946 --> 01:49:33,526
His energy was gone.

1727
01:49:33,866 --> 01:49:37,866
May I read from one of Mrs Voyter's
recent books, "The Black House"?

1728
01:49:38,026 --> 01:49:39,866
We judge facts, not books.

1729
01:49:40,026 --> 01:49:42,736
Judge, this is a slippery slope.

1730
01:49:42,906 --> 01:49:46,326
In 2017, Sandra Voyter herself
declared, and I quote,

1731
01:49:46,486 --> 01:49:49,526
"My books are linked to my life
and those in it."

1732
01:49:49,736 --> 01:49:52,656
Objection! She's always said
her work is fiction.

1733
01:49:53,276 --> 01:49:55,736
First book is her mother's death!

1734
01:49:55,906 --> 01:49:57,656
Second, a rift with her father.

1735
01:49:57,826 --> 01:50:00,026
Third, her son's accident, etc.

1736
01:50:00,196 --> 01:50:02,276
Her books are part of this trial.

1737
01:50:02,446 --> 01:50:05,326
Her life is in them,
her relationship in particular.

1738
01:50:05,486 --> 01:50:07,326
Go ahead, but keep it brief.

1739
01:50:07,986 --> 01:50:11,116
This is a wife
talking about her husband.

1740
01:50:13,946 --> 01:50:16,906
"He'd stopped complaining.
He'd given up."

1741
01:50:17,406 --> 01:50:20,696
"She studied him,
repulsed by his resignation."

1742
01:50:21,406 --> 01:50:24,616
"An idea sprouted in her mind,
a seed of deliverance."

1743
01:50:24,946 --> 01:50:26,366
"The possibility of his death."

1744
01:50:26,526 --> 01:50:27,616
Give us the context.

1745
01:50:27,776 --> 01:50:29,616
Later: "How does one kill?"

1746
01:50:29,776 --> 01:50:32,576
"What about the body? Its weight?

1747
01:50:32,736 --> 01:50:35,026
"She could think of nothing else.

1748
01:50:35,446 --> 01:50:39,196
"She saw him dead,
his body a lump no longer desired.

1749
01:50:39,366 --> 01:50:41,196
"The body she'd loved

1750
01:50:41,366 --> 01:50:43,576
was now in the way
and had to go."

1751
01:50:43,736 --> 01:50:45,446
I'll provide the context.

1752
01:50:45,656 --> 01:50:49,116
This is a minor character,
going insane,

1753
01:50:49,276 --> 01:50:51,276
who doesn't act on her thoughts.

1754
01:50:51,446 --> 01:50:53,866
A novel is not life!
An author is not her characters.

1755
01:50:54,026 --> 01:50:57,326
But an author can express herself
through her characters.

1756
01:50:57,486 --> 01:50:58,946
You flagged this passage.

1757
01:50:59,116 --> 01:51:00,906
How can we not see a link?

1758
01:51:01,116 --> 01:51:03,116
Is Stephen King a serial killer?

1759
01:51:03,276 --> 01:51:06,276
Did his wife turn up dead
in suspicious circumstances?

1760
01:51:06,446 --> 01:51:07,526
Focus on the facts!

1761
01:51:07,736 --> 01:51:11,116
Mr. Renzi,
I strongly advise you to calm down.

1762
01:51:11,276 --> 01:51:14,526
Prosecutor, I advise you
to follow Mr. Renzi's advice.

1763
01:51:15,196 --> 01:51:17,366
Focus on the facts.

1764
01:51:20,616 --> 01:51:22,196
Aside from the slap

1765
01:51:22,406 --> 01:51:25,156
you admitted to,
did you ever hit your husband?

1766
01:51:25,616 --> 01:51:26,696
Never?

1767
01:51:27,326 --> 01:51:28,576
That was the only time?

1768
01:51:28,776 --> 01:51:32,156
You were always a good,
admirable soul,

1769
01:51:32,616 --> 01:51:34,406
altruistic, reasonable,

1770
01:51:34,576 --> 01:51:36,696
trying to save him from himself,

1771
01:51:36,866 --> 01:51:39,406
except on this recording?
Rotten luck!

1772
01:51:40,986 --> 01:51:42,986
Any more questions
for the witness?

1773
01:51:43,156 --> 01:51:45,276
I have one more, if I may.

1774
01:51:46,576 --> 01:51:49,076
I'd like to know if Maleski

1775
01:51:49,276 --> 01:51:51,366
sent the transcripts to anyone?

1776
01:51:51,526 --> 01:51:54,076
He sent them to a publisher friend,
Paul Nachez,

1777
01:51:54,236 --> 01:51:56,196
slated to publish his first novel.

1778
01:51:56,366 --> 01:51:58,026
Email from August 9, 2017:

1779
01:51:58,196 --> 01:52:01,736
"I'm writing again, I need your eye.
Still rough, eager to talk."

1780
01:52:01,906 --> 01:52:03,076
Nachez's response:

1781
01:52:03,276 --> 01:52:05,616
"Sure, send it and I'll read it."

1782
01:52:05,776 --> 01:52:08,736
Up to his death,
Maleski sent 4 texts a week.

1783
01:52:08,906 --> 01:52:10,736
What was their communication like?

1784
01:52:10,906 --> 01:52:13,076
The publisher never replied.

1785
01:52:13,406 --> 01:52:16,116
Apparently he was busy
and the project mystified him.

1786
01:52:16,826 --> 01:52:18,406
His friend's silence

1787
01:52:18,616 --> 01:52:22,826
must've hurt Mr. Maleski's
already low self-esteem.

1788
01:52:22,986 --> 01:52:24,526
He feels rejected.

1789
01:52:25,026 --> 01:52:27,776
When we read all the writing he sent,

1790
01:52:27,946 --> 01:52:30,236
it's difficult
to identify a storyline.

1791
01:52:30,406 --> 01:52:31,986
At best, it's a project.

1792
01:52:32,156 --> 01:52:33,656
Maleski is a "project man".

1793
01:52:33,826 --> 01:52:36,326
His first abandoned novel,
the chalet...

1794
01:52:37,026 --> 01:52:40,986
So, since we're being asked
to mix justice and literature,

1795
01:52:41,156 --> 01:52:43,026
to imagine what we don't know,

1796
01:52:43,196 --> 01:52:46,986
let's imagine
Samuel Maleski's final year.

1797
01:52:47,156 --> 01:52:48,906
And I'm dabbling in fantasy?

1798
01:52:49,116 --> 01:52:53,026
Give me half the time
you took to read a book!

1799
01:52:53,196 --> 01:52:54,576
Get to the point.

1800
01:52:55,156 --> 01:52:57,366
What was
Samuel Maleski's final year like?

1801
01:52:58,776 --> 01:53:02,946
After accumulating debt
from medical procedures in London,

1802
01:53:03,116 --> 01:53:06,156
he insists on returning
to his hometown.

1803
01:53:06,326 --> 01:53:09,906
He finds a chalet to fix up and rent.
They'll pay off their debts.

1804
01:53:10,076 --> 01:53:13,026
He'll quit teaching
and start writing full-time.

1805
01:53:13,446 --> 01:53:17,156
Renovation proves tricky.
They have to take out a loan.

1806
01:53:17,946 --> 01:53:19,946
A vicious circle begins.

1807
01:53:20,116 --> 01:53:24,116
Samuel needs his teaching wages.
Renovations drag on.

1808
01:53:24,276 --> 01:53:26,446
A year and a half later,

1809
01:53:26,616 --> 01:53:27,986
he feels trapped.

1810
01:53:28,326 --> 01:53:29,866
He's a wounded man.

1811
01:53:30,076 --> 01:53:31,866
His son's accident,
his abandoned novel,

1812
01:53:32,026 --> 01:53:34,406
his wife publishing book after book.

1813
01:53:35,156 --> 01:53:36,576
He must write!

1814
01:53:38,906 --> 01:53:42,236
He quits the antidepressants
and starts recording his life,

1815
01:53:42,406 --> 01:53:44,986
embarking on a kind of auto-fiction,

1816
01:53:45,156 --> 01:53:48,196
perhaps inspired by Sandra's method.

1817
01:53:48,366 --> 01:53:51,276
And why not?
She borrows from their lives.

1818
01:53:51,446 --> 01:53:53,366
She did borrow his idea.

1819
01:53:53,576 --> 01:53:54,866
Save it for your plea.

1820
01:53:55,026 --> 01:53:58,946
He's running.
But refuses to see that transcribing

1821
01:53:59,156 --> 01:54:00,236
is not writing.

1822
01:54:00,406 --> 01:54:03,076
His publisher friend's silence
humiliates him.

1823
01:54:04,276 --> 01:54:07,236
What do we hear
in the March 4th fight?

1824
01:54:07,576 --> 01:54:10,526
The energy, the willfulness...
What is it?

1825
01:54:10,906 --> 01:54:12,486
The energy of despair.

1826
01:54:12,656 --> 01:54:15,486
The final push before giving up.

1827
01:54:18,776 --> 01:54:23,026
In his final days, this man
isn't facing a war in his marriage.

1828
01:54:24,236 --> 01:54:26,326
He's facing his own failures.

1829
01:54:28,026 --> 01:54:30,156
Sandra Voyter is only guilty

1830
01:54:30,326 --> 01:54:32,986
of succeeding
where her husband failed.

1831
01:54:37,026 --> 01:54:41,446
Despite appearances, those were not
Mr. Renzi's closing arguments.

1832
01:54:43,196 --> 01:54:44,946
That wasn't Samuel.

1833
01:54:45,116 --> 01:54:48,236
It's Friday evening,
we have a weekend ahead of us.

1834
01:54:48,906 --> 01:54:51,446
Before I adjourn,
I have an announcement.

1835
01:54:51,616 --> 01:54:54,946
I've decided to call Daniel
back to the bar on Monday.

1836
01:54:55,366 --> 01:54:57,616
He has new information of interest.

1837
01:54:57,826 --> 01:55:01,366
Since the witness
is the defendant's son

1838
01:55:01,826 --> 01:55:03,736
and lives with his mother,

1839
01:55:03,906 --> 01:55:07,406
I'm asking everyone
to refrain from contacting him.

1840
01:55:07,866 --> 01:55:11,276
Obviously, if contact is inevitable,

1841
01:55:11,446 --> 01:55:14,366
refrain from discussing the trial.

1842
01:55:14,526 --> 01:55:15,776
Mrs Berger,

1843
01:55:15,946 --> 01:55:19,026
you'll stay with Daniel all weekend.

1844
01:55:20,026 --> 01:55:23,406
See to it these rules are respected.

1845
01:55:23,616 --> 01:55:25,486
I insist that no one,

1846
01:55:25,656 --> 01:55:29,946
absolutely no one,
can ask him about his testimony.

1847
01:55:30,826 --> 01:55:33,026
Have a good weekend,
get some rest.

1848
01:55:33,196 --> 01:55:34,906
Court is adjourned.

1849
01:56:22,946 --> 01:56:25,156
- Come get warm.
- Ready in 10!

1850
01:56:31,446 --> 01:56:32,576
You OK?

1851
01:56:39,906 --> 01:56:41,986
I think I want to be alone.

1852
01:56:43,446 --> 01:56:44,656
OK.

1853
01:56:46,326 --> 01:56:48,616
- You can eat in your room.
- No.

1854
01:56:48,776 --> 01:56:50,656
I want to be alone this weekend.

1855
01:56:51,156 --> 01:56:52,276
Before I testify.

1856
01:56:52,446 --> 01:56:53,446
Alone?

1857
01:56:53,526 --> 01:56:55,156
Just you and me?

1858
01:56:56,156 --> 01:56:57,156
Is that it?

1859
01:56:58,776 --> 01:57:00,406
Are you sure?

1860
01:57:01,616 --> 01:57:04,866
We can find other solutions.
It's a big house.

1861
01:57:05,486 --> 01:57:07,026
I want her to leave.

1862
01:57:17,946 --> 01:57:19,526
I just spoke to Daniel.

1863
01:57:20,576 --> 01:57:23,236
He wants to be alone this weekend.

1864
01:57:23,406 --> 01:57:25,116
Until the end of the trial.

1865
01:57:39,576 --> 01:57:41,826
Is that what you want?

1866
01:57:46,776 --> 01:57:49,276
OK. Is it because
of what you heard today?

1867
01:57:49,446 --> 01:57:52,696
I couldn't talk to you
about all that before.

1868
01:57:52,866 --> 01:57:55,156
We weren't allowed to..

1869
01:57:56,406 --> 01:57:57,526
No trial talk.

1870
01:57:57,696 --> 01:58:00,406
I know, I'm just talking to my son.

1871
01:58:00,866 --> 01:58:01,946
OK.

1872
01:58:03,236 --> 01:58:05,776
I totally understand
that you need calm.

1873
01:58:05,946 --> 01:58:08,366
I can mind my own business,
keep to myself.

1874
01:58:08,526 --> 01:58:11,776
I won't talk to you
if you don't want. Can we try that?

1875
01:58:11,986 --> 01:58:13,196
No speaking English.

1876
01:58:14,236 --> 01:58:16,326
You can talk to me.

1877
01:58:17,366 --> 01:58:21,526
Couldn't you and I discuss this,
and then you decide?

1878
01:58:23,696 --> 01:58:25,736
I think he's made his decision.

1879
01:58:36,696 --> 01:58:38,906
Yeah, I'll just get my stuff.

1880
01:59:05,276 --> 01:59:06,866
Somebody said,

1881
01:59:07,696 --> 01:59:10,076
of course money
doesn't make you happy,

1882
01:59:10,406 --> 01:59:14,446
but it's still better to cry in a car
than in a subway.

1883
01:59:17,866 --> 01:59:18,906
Who said that?

1884
01:59:19,076 --> 01:59:20,406
I don't know.

1885
02:00:21,616 --> 02:00:22,906
Sorry.

1886
02:00:48,446 --> 02:00:49,526
Go on.

1887
02:00:56,366 --> 02:00:57,656
Eat up.

1888
02:01:26,866 --> 02:01:27,986
Snoop...

1889
02:01:40,236 --> 02:01:41,406
Marge!

1890
02:01:43,826 --> 02:01:46,116
Marge, come quick, please!

1891
02:01:52,696 --> 02:01:53,696
What is it?

1892
02:01:56,576 --> 02:01:59,076
I gave him aspirin,
I messed up bad.

1893
02:02:00,156 --> 02:02:02,196
- You gave him aspirin?
- Yes!

1894
02:02:02,366 --> 02:02:03,486
How much?

1895
02:02:04,076 --> 02:02:06,446
8 or 10, I can't remember.

1896
02:02:06,616 --> 02:02:07,616
A lot.

1897
02:02:08,446 --> 02:02:09,866
Make him vomit.

1898
02:02:10,026 --> 02:02:11,196
Why'd you do that?

1899
02:02:11,986 --> 02:02:13,766
Make him vomit! Please!

1900
02:02:13,876 --> 02:02:14,916
OK, hang on.

1901
02:02:17,156 --> 02:02:18,276
"Make a dog vomit."

1902
02:02:19,026 --> 02:02:20,236
Hang on.

1903
02:02:20,406 --> 02:02:23,076
We need saltwater.
Be right back.

1904
02:02:33,236 --> 02:02:34,326
He's not moving.

1905
02:02:34,526 --> 02:02:36,116
Daniel, help me.

1906
02:02:37,366 --> 02:02:38,736
Open his mouth.

1907
02:02:39,616 --> 02:02:40,656
Easy.

1908
02:02:50,196 --> 02:02:51,736
That's right.

1909
02:02:57,236 --> 02:02:58,446
That's good.

1910
02:03:01,116 --> 02:03:02,866
He's coming around.

1911
02:03:05,406 --> 02:03:07,946
- What's happening?
- He's going to vomit.

1912
02:03:13,826 --> 02:03:14,826
That's it.

1913
02:03:14,946 --> 02:03:16,276
He'll be OK.

1914
02:03:20,076 --> 02:03:21,446
Good dog.

1915
02:03:29,576 --> 02:03:32,366
He's OK, he's breathing.
Looking at us.

1916
02:03:37,776 --> 02:03:39,026
Can you explain?

1917
02:03:42,826 --> 02:03:44,236
You know, I...

1918
02:03:44,906 --> 02:03:46,946
I'd never heard about...

1919
02:03:48,406 --> 02:03:50,576
my dad's suicide attempt.

1920
02:03:51,716 --> 02:03:54,046
I'd never heard about...

1921
02:03:54,776 --> 02:03:57,526
the shrink, the medicine...

1922
02:03:58,446 --> 02:03:59,756
the vomit and aspirin.

1923
02:04:00,826 --> 02:04:03,526
When my mom talked about it,
I remembered something

1924
02:04:03,696 --> 02:04:05,276
from around that time.

1925
02:04:06,366 --> 02:04:07,486
One morning,

1926
02:04:07,716 --> 02:04:09,966
Snoop was lying on my bedroom floor.

1927
02:04:10,116 --> 02:04:12,276
Not moving.
He smelled like vomit.

1928
02:04:14,276 --> 02:04:16,326
I figured he'd vomited.

1929
02:04:17,776 --> 02:04:19,616
I cleaned his muzzle.

1930
02:04:20,656 --> 02:04:22,826
I figured he'd...

1931
02:04:23,326 --> 02:04:27,076
I don't know, caught a virus
or something, because...

1932
02:04:27,866 --> 02:04:30,486
he acted strange for days.

1933
02:04:30,656 --> 02:04:32,576
He just slept or drank.

1934
02:04:33,736 --> 02:04:37,986
See? Now I'm thinking
maybe he ate my dad's vomit,

1935
02:04:38,156 --> 02:04:39,656
and "that" made him sick,

1936
02:04:39,826 --> 02:04:41,866
and Mom told the truth!

1937
02:04:43,406 --> 02:04:46,236
So my experiment with the aspirin

1938
02:04:46,406 --> 02:04:48,366
was to see how he'd react.

1939
02:04:48,526 --> 02:04:49,616
And you saw.

1940
02:04:49,776 --> 02:04:53,406
He slept for 14 hours.
Now he's drinking all the time.

1941
02:04:53,576 --> 02:04:55,576
He smells exactly the same!

1942
02:04:56,196 --> 02:04:57,196
Everything!

1943
02:04:57,256 --> 02:04:59,296
Everything's exactly the same!

1944
02:05:00,866 --> 02:05:02,366
But since..

1945
02:05:03,006 --> 02:05:06,416
Since yesterday,
I'm not sure if I believe her or not.

1946
02:05:06,576 --> 02:05:08,446
I knew they fought, but...

1947
02:05:12,946 --> 02:05:14,486
It wasn't...

1948
02:05:15,616 --> 02:05:18,236
I didn't think it was that violent.

1949
02:05:20,236 --> 02:05:22,616
Your memories are all you're sure of,

1950
02:05:22,776 --> 02:05:24,776
and it's important to tell the jury.

1951
02:05:24,946 --> 02:05:26,736
But you're just a witness.

1952
02:05:26,906 --> 02:05:29,236
Do you think she could've killed him?

1953
02:05:32,736 --> 02:05:34,116
It's not for me to judge.

1954
02:05:34,276 --> 02:05:37,196
I know,
but you could at least tell me!

1955
02:05:37,426 --> 02:05:40,676
I can't answer that.
My role is to protect you...

1956
02:05:40,886 --> 02:05:42,676
Fucking help me!

1957
02:06:19,946 --> 02:06:21,156
Actually,

1958
02:06:21,326 --> 02:06:23,486
when we lack an element

1959
02:06:23,716 --> 02:06:26,166
to judge something,
and the lack is unbearable,

1960
02:06:27,326 --> 02:06:29,406
all we can do is decide.

1961
02:06:30,906 --> 02:06:32,076
You see?

1962
02:06:32,736 --> 02:06:35,576
To overcome doubt,
sometimes we have to...

1963
02:06:35,736 --> 02:06:38,406
decide to sway
one way rather than the other.

1964
02:06:40,366 --> 02:06:44,276
Since you need to believe one thing
but have two choices,

1965
02:06:44,446 --> 02:06:45,946
you must choose.

1966
02:06:47,026 --> 02:06:49,236
So you have to invent your belief?

1967
02:06:49,576 --> 02:06:51,616
Yes, well... in a sense.

1968
02:06:51,986 --> 02:06:54,656
So that means, I'm not sure...

1969
02:06:55,576 --> 02:06:59,196
and you're saying
I have to pretend I'm sure?

1970
02:06:59,986 --> 02:07:01,986
No, I'm saying decide.

1971
02:07:03,656 --> 02:07:05,236
That's different.

1972
02:07:36,866 --> 02:07:40,486
What strikes me is
we don't know who's more lyrical.

1973
02:07:40,696 --> 02:07:43,526
- The author or the character?
- Both, no doubt!

1974
02:07:43,696 --> 02:07:45,486
Voyter plays with confusion.

1975
02:07:45,656 --> 02:07:47,486
Her second book goes further,

1976
02:07:47,696 --> 02:07:50,866
telling how her father
couldn't stand the first.

1977
02:07:51,026 --> 02:07:52,156
Undoubtedly true.

1978
02:07:52,326 --> 02:07:56,076
The rift degenerates,
forcing her to leave her country.

1979
02:07:56,276 --> 02:08:00,366
Fearing her father's rage,
she falls prey to horrifying visions.

1980
02:08:00,526 --> 02:08:04,776
I found this troubling quote
in an interview. She says,

1981
02:08:05,116 --> 02:08:07,076
"My job is to cover the tracks,"

1982
02:08:07,236 --> 02:08:09,986
"so fiction can destroy reality."

1983
02:08:11,576 --> 02:08:13,406
Yes, and what excites people

1984
02:08:13,576 --> 02:08:15,656
about the Samuel Maleski case,

1985
02:08:15,826 --> 02:08:18,696
is that it seems to come
from one of her books.

1986
02:08:18,866 --> 02:08:21,326
It feels like
she's already written it.

1987
02:08:21,486 --> 02:08:25,156
Even the doubts around his death,
the way he died,

1988
02:08:25,326 --> 02:08:28,656
Voyter's murky personality,
the amoral, deceptive traits

1989
02:08:28,826 --> 02:08:30,196
she seems to overplay...

1990
02:08:30,366 --> 02:08:32,776
It all reads like her books.

1991
02:08:32,986 --> 02:08:35,406
I don't think it matters how he died.

1992
02:08:35,576 --> 02:08:39,156
The fact is, the idea of a writer
killing her husband

1993
02:08:39,326 --> 02:08:42,986
is far more compelling
than a teacher killing himself.

1994
02:10:53,696 --> 02:10:56,406
If I imagine my mother doing it,
I don't understand.

1995
02:10:58,776 --> 02:11:00,696
But if I imagine my father...

1996
02:11:02,946 --> 02:11:05,156
I think I can understand.

1997
02:11:11,366 --> 02:11:13,526
Prosecutor, any questions?

1998
02:11:16,486 --> 02:11:19,196
The experiment on his dog
proves nothing.

1999
02:11:19,366 --> 02:11:21,156
It's not documented.

2000
02:11:21,326 --> 02:11:24,236
More problematic
are these providential memories,

2001
02:11:24,406 --> 02:11:27,776
clearly jarred
by what he heard during the trial.

2002
02:11:28,406 --> 02:11:31,526
No event can be placed
convincingly on our timeline.

2003
02:11:31,696 --> 02:11:34,276
The time frame of 6 months
before Maleski's death

2004
02:11:34,446 --> 02:11:36,256
comes only from testimony

2005
02:11:36,406 --> 02:11:38,576
given by the defendant herself.

2006
02:11:42,326 --> 02:11:43,736
I'd like to know...

2007
02:11:50,406 --> 02:11:51,776
Did you ever wonder

2008
02:11:51,986 --> 02:11:54,946
if the overdose
your father supposedly took

2009
02:11:55,116 --> 02:11:58,526
might've resulted
not from a suicide attempt,

2010
02:11:58,696 --> 02:12:01,526
but from an attempt by your mother
to poison him?

2011
02:12:01,696 --> 02:12:04,406
I'm not accusing,
just making a point.

2012
02:12:04,576 --> 02:12:06,986
So, taking these speculations,

2013
02:12:07,156 --> 02:12:09,736
why choose one over the other?

2014
02:12:09,906 --> 02:12:13,986
Your memories speak
to the consequences, not the causes.

2015
02:12:15,196 --> 02:12:17,576
Yes, I thought about that, but...

2016
02:12:18,486 --> 02:12:20,906
I don't see
why she would've done it.

2017
02:12:21,446 --> 02:12:23,866
It feels like when we lack proof

2018
02:12:24,026 --> 02:12:26,696
to make us sure
how something happened,

2019
02:12:27,236 --> 02:12:30,156
we have to look further,
as the trial is doing.

2020
02:12:30,676 --> 02:12:34,216
When we've looked everywhere
and still don't understand

2021
02:12:34,426 --> 02:12:36,876
how the thing happened,

2022
02:12:37,026 --> 02:12:39,906
I think we have to ask
why it happened.

2023
02:12:44,906 --> 02:12:46,196
Thank you, Daniel.

2024
02:12:47,026 --> 02:12:48,196
Are you finished?

2025
02:12:56,576 --> 02:12:57,776
No.

2026
02:12:59,446 --> 02:13:01,196
I want to say something else.

2027
02:13:08,276 --> 02:13:12,696
Since my dog was sick for days,
Dad and I went to the vet.

2028
02:13:14,156 --> 02:13:16,276
Dad was really quiet in the car.

2029
02:13:16,446 --> 02:13:19,736
He didn't even play music.
He usually always does.

2030
02:13:22,326 --> 02:13:25,276
After a while,
he started talking about Snoop.

2031
02:13:26,866 --> 02:13:27,656
He said,

2032
02:13:27,836 --> 02:13:29,836
"You know, he could get sick."

2033
02:13:30,486 --> 02:13:33,736
"Even die. You know that.
You need to be ready."

2034
02:13:35,326 --> 02:13:36,946
I didn't want to hear that.

2035
02:13:37,696 --> 02:13:40,906
Snoop was doing better.
He was still young.

2036
02:13:41,136 --> 02:13:42,296
He'd never been sick.

2037
02:13:42,446 --> 02:13:44,696
I told him he wasn't going to die.

2038
02:13:46,796 --> 02:13:48,166
But he kept going.

2039
02:13:48,696 --> 02:13:52,946
He said, "You need to be aware of it.
It'll happen someday."

2040
02:13:53,906 --> 02:13:56,906
"And it's no wonder Snoop gets tired."

2041
02:13:57,076 --> 02:13:59,076
"He's not so young in dog years."

2042
02:14:02,276 --> 02:14:03,986
"Can you imagine his life?"

2043
02:14:06,156 --> 02:14:07,866
"He's not just any dog."

2044
02:14:08,826 --> 02:14:10,406
"He's a great dog."

2045
02:14:11,946 --> 02:14:13,826
"An outstanding dog."

2046
02:14:14,826 --> 02:14:17,776
"Think about it.
He anticipates your needs,"

2047
02:14:18,196 --> 02:14:20,406
"foresees your movements,"

2048
02:14:20,986 --> 02:14:22,736
"keeps you safe from danger."

2049
02:14:24,526 --> 02:14:26,776
"He spends his life
imagining your needs"

2050
02:14:26,946 --> 02:14:29,236
"thinking about what you can't see."

2051
02:14:32,826 --> 02:14:34,236
"Maybe he's tired."

2052
02:14:34,656 --> 02:14:36,326
"Always caring for others."

2053
02:14:37,116 --> 02:14:39,076
"Maybe one day, he'll be done."

2054
02:14:39,946 --> 02:14:41,236
"That could happen."

2055
02:14:46,326 --> 02:14:48,196
And I remember at the end,

2056
02:14:50,026 --> 02:14:51,986
he said, "One day",

2057
02:14:52,156 --> 02:14:55,116
"when it's time
for him to go, he'll go."

2058
02:14:56,236 --> 02:14:59,736
"You won't be able to help it.
Prepare yourself, it'll be hard."

2059
02:14:59,906 --> 02:15:02,326
"But it won't be
the end of your life."

2060
02:15:08,906 --> 02:15:10,446
He meant himself.

2061
02:15:11,276 --> 02:15:12,526
Now...

2062
02:15:13,946 --> 02:15:16,076
Now I know he meant himself.

2063
02:15:22,776 --> 02:15:25,946
I implore the jurors to bear in mind

2064
02:15:26,156 --> 02:15:28,406
this story is extremely subjective.

2065
02:15:28,826 --> 02:15:32,736
In no way does it qualify
as any form of proof.

2066
02:15:53,116 --> 02:15:56,986
Yes Serge, we are still
outside the courthouse in Grenoble.

2067
02:15:57,156 --> 02:16:00,076
The trial was scheduled
to end on Friday,

2068
02:16:00,236 --> 02:16:02,696
but Sandra Voyter's son Daniel

2069
02:16:02,866 --> 02:16:05,196
insisted on testifying again
this morning.

2070
02:16:05,366 --> 02:16:06,946
The jury is still...

2071
02:16:22,756 --> 02:16:23,776
Daniel.

2072
02:16:24,156 --> 02:16:27,736
Mrs Voyter, how do you feel...

2073
02:16:27,946 --> 02:16:30,076
after being acquitted?

2074
02:16:31,176 --> 02:16:34,756
There were too many words
in this trial.

2075
02:16:35,076 --> 02:16:36,486
I've nothing more to say.

2076
02:16:36,986 --> 02:16:40,236
I want to call my son and go home.

2077
02:16:41,326 --> 02:16:45,366
Obviously I thank my lawyers,
who always believed in me.

2078
02:16:45,526 --> 02:16:48,156
Mr. Renzi, are you relieved?

2079
02:16:48,326 --> 02:16:50,486
I commend the jury,

2080
02:16:50,826 --> 02:16:53,406
who saw Sandra Voyter as she is...

2081
02:17:55,156 --> 02:17:57,026
Marge, it's Sandra.

2082
02:17:59,116 --> 02:18:01,656
Yes, it's incredible, we're relieved.

2083
02:18:05,696 --> 02:18:07,906
Does Daniel want to talk to me?

2084
02:18:10,366 --> 02:18:12,616
Of course, he must be tired,

2085
02:18:12,846 --> 02:18:14,046
I understand.

2086
02:18:15,866 --> 02:18:18,776
Does he mind if I come home tonight?

2087
02:18:19,006 --> 02:18:20,876
Would he prefer tomorrow, or...

2088
02:18:25,776 --> 02:18:27,486
OK, OK.

2089
02:18:28,196 --> 02:18:31,776
We'll get some dinner,
then I'll be home. See you then.

2090
02:18:35,326 --> 02:18:36,776
I need a drink.

2091
02:18:41,346 --> 02:18:42,596
Another!

2092
02:18:51,406 --> 02:18:52,776
Do you always...

2093
02:18:52,946 --> 02:18:56,076
When you win,
do you always do this?

2094
02:18:56,236 --> 02:18:57,616
We never win.

2095
02:18:59,326 --> 02:19:02,116
That's the fucking first time
in our life we win!

2096
02:19:02,276 --> 02:19:03,616
- No!
- Yes, of course!

2097
02:19:03,776 --> 02:19:05,776
You told me you're a good lawyer.

2098
02:19:09,276 --> 02:19:10,526
No, it's not true!

2099
02:19:10,646 --> 02:19:11,646
It's not spicy.

2100
02:19:11,736 --> 02:19:13,526
You have to try this, really.

2101
02:19:13,736 --> 02:19:15,026
We ate too much.

2102
02:19:15,196 --> 02:19:16,276
I'm gonna throw up.

2103
02:19:16,486 --> 02:19:18,116
A quick smoke first.

2104
02:19:18,446 --> 02:19:19,526
Be right back.

2105
02:19:24,276 --> 02:19:25,576
You first.

2106
02:19:39,446 --> 02:19:41,236
It's not so easy, huh?

2107
02:19:42,906 --> 02:19:44,736
With all the bones, and...

2108
02:19:49,366 --> 02:19:50,576
After this, we go?

2109
02:19:50,906 --> 02:19:52,446
Ready to go home?

2110
02:19:53,276 --> 02:19:55,866
I can drive, I can drive you.

2111
02:19:57,026 --> 02:19:58,076
One more.

2112
02:19:58,866 --> 02:20:00,276
For the road.

2113
02:20:01,616 --> 02:20:03,486
Of course, for the driver.

2114
02:20:04,576 --> 02:20:05,656
Same?

2115
02:20:13,826 --> 02:20:15,526
Can I just get

2116
02:20:15,736 --> 02:20:17,946
two more of these? Thanks.

2117
02:20:34,116 --> 02:20:35,156
To you.

2118
02:20:50,446 --> 02:20:51,616
Are you alright?

2119
02:20:55,826 --> 02:20:57,026
Tell me.

2120
02:20:57,736 --> 02:20:59,736
I just, I thought...

2121
02:21:01,326 --> 02:21:03,866
I thought I'd feel relieved.

2122
02:21:07,526 --> 02:21:09,366
It doesn't come right away.

2123
02:21:11,486 --> 02:21:12,656
Sure?

2124
02:21:12,826 --> 02:21:13,906
Not sure.

2125
02:21:17,276 --> 02:21:19,736
It's just, you know,
when you lose, you lose.

2126
02:21:20,326 --> 02:21:22,276
It's the worst thing that can happen,

2127
02:21:22,446 --> 02:21:23,866
and if you win...

2128
02:21:26,446 --> 02:21:29,406
you expect some reward.

2129
02:21:30,946 --> 02:21:32,406
But there isn't any.

2130
02:21:33,236 --> 02:21:34,406
It's just...

2131
02:21:36,276 --> 02:21:37,696
It's just over.

2132
02:21:42,656 --> 02:21:45,446
Maybe sometimes,
we expect too much.

2133
02:21:48,736 --> 02:21:49,986
Yeah, maybe.

2134
02:22:55,736 --> 02:22:56,986
Hi.

2135
02:22:57,986 --> 02:22:59,326
Sorry.

2136
02:23:01,276 --> 02:23:03,866
He tried to wait up but fell asleep.

2137
02:23:53,156 --> 02:23:54,696
I'll be going now.

2138
02:23:54,866 --> 02:23:56,076
Not staying over?

2139
02:23:56,236 --> 02:23:58,116
No, I'll leave you be.

2140
02:24:04,446 --> 02:24:05,616
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

2141
02:24:22,776 --> 02:24:24,906
I was afraid of you coming home.

2142
02:24:26,656 --> 02:24:29,776
Me too,
I was afraid to come home.
