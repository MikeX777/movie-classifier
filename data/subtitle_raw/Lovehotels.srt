1
00:00:29,554 --> 00:00:30,555
What do you think about 'love'?

2
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:32,682
About love?

3
00:00:34,851 --> 00:00:35,518
About love?

4
00:00:37,145 --> 00:00:38,313
What? To care for one another?

5
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:39,230
Oh, I knew it.

6
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:43,401
It's when you realize that someone likes you.

7
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:46,071
Huh? So it depends on your partner, and not your feelings?

8
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:48,948
She is going out with two guys now.

9
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:50,325
Wow!

10
00:00:50,658 --> 00:00:52,035
No, no!

11
00:00:52,327 --> 00:00:52,994
So, do you really have two boyfriends?

12
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:54,537
It's pretty lonely having just one boyfriend.

13
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:56,247
Don't you think so?

14
00:00:56,498 --> 00:00:58,249
Then which guy do you like better?

15
00:00:58,416 --> 00:00:59,626
I can't choose right now.

16
00:01:00,043 --> 00:01:01,795
Oh, my!

17
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:03,755
A tempting girl huh?

18
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:06,841
No, it's not that I can't choose right now.

19
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:11,388
I just don't know how to make the choice.

20
00:01:11,429 --> 00:01:15,767
Why don't you ask the two guys to live together?
All three of you.

21
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:19,938
Isn't it hard to love two people at the same time?

22
00:01:20,271 --> 00:01:23,900
What does it mean to 'love' someone?

23
00:02:23,001 --> 00:02:25,128
Did you go to the sea this summer?

24
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,700
No.

25
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,500
No. Did you?

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,500
Ah, yes.

27
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,000
I spent my whole summer at sea.

28
00:02:36,139 --> 00:02:38,183
Oh, I envy you.

29
00:02:39,434 --> 00:02:41,144
I wanna go too.

30
00:02:43,313 --> 00:02:46,816
You're not really suited for the sea.

31
00:02:47,942 --> 00:02:50,445
Eh? It is that unpleasant?

32
00:02:53,531 --> 00:02:54,949
You're like "Miss Christmas".

33
00:02:59,037 --> 00:03:00,497
I just found this here.

34
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:04,626
You should say something about this dress.

35
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,004
So, you like Christmas, don't you?

36
00:03:10,882 --> 00:03:11,925
Not really.

37
00:03:14,636 --> 00:03:16,513
What did you do last Christmas?

38
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,223
Last year?

39
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:20,308
What did I... do...

40
00:03:24,854 --> 00:03:29,818
What will you say if I say that I came here last year too?

41
00:03:35,407 --> 00:03:36,700
It's ok.

42
00:03:37,742 --> 00:03:38,743
So did I.

43
00:03:39,077 --> 00:03:39,869
Are you serious?

44
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:41,871
I'm kidding.

45
00:03:51,381 --> 00:03:53,383
No, you should close your eyes.

46
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,384
Why?

47
00:03:54,676 --> 00:03:56,052
Just close your eyes.

48
00:04:14,612 --> 00:04:17,282
Didn't you do something like this when you were a child?

49
00:04:18,616 --> 00:04:20,702
No, it's my first time.

50
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,000
OK. You can open your eyes now.

51
00:04:28,793 --> 00:04:29,794
Wow.

52
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:33,089
Merry Christmas.

53
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:34,758
What? All these...

54
00:04:35,091 --> 00:04:37,260
Yes, it's all of yours.

55
00:04:38,303 --> 00:04:39,721
I didn't know what you'll like.

56
00:04:42,307 --> 00:04:43,391
Oh, I see...

57
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:46,061
Thank you so much!!

58
00:04:51,566 --> 00:04:52,567
Suzuko,

59
00:04:53,735 --> 00:04:56,613
I haven't got a Christmas present for you.

60
00:05:00,158 --> 00:05:05,413
Sorry, but I didn't think Christmas is that special.

61
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:07,957
Never mind.

62
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:15,254
Now we're enjoying the Christmas together. That's enough.

63
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:19,260
I see.

64
00:05:24,516 --> 00:05:27,102
I was just happy that you asked me for a date.

65
00:05:30,355 --> 00:05:31,856
Look at this.

66
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,653
I've got a tattoo on my back.

67
00:05:36,986 --> 00:05:38,488
What? Is this real?

68
00:05:38,822 --> 00:05:42,242
Yes. It won't disappear whether
I take a bath or if you lick on it.

69
00:05:55,005 --> 00:05:56,172
This is good for a wound.

70
00:06:26,077 --> 00:06:27,287
You're completely into Christmas.

71
00:06:28,246 --> 00:06:28,830
It suits you.

72
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:30,040
Don't it?

73
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:32,876
Here. You have to open these quick.

74
00:06:33,418 --> 00:06:35,879
These will disappear when the candles burn out.

75
00:06:36,755 --> 00:06:37,839
They will disappear?

76
00:06:38,715 --> 00:06:40,717
Yes, they will.

77
00:06:43,053 --> 00:06:46,514
Your parents said the same to you, didn't they, Sou?

78
00:06:46,765 --> 00:06:48,224
I was the only child,

79
00:06:48,892 --> 00:06:51,853
so I could get as many presents as I want.

80
00:06:52,187 --> 00:06:53,396
Like this?

81
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:56,900
It is close.

82
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:01,905
Your dad and mom must have thought
a lot about what to buy for you.

83
00:07:03,281 --> 00:07:06,034
Not as much as I did today.

84
00:07:08,453 --> 00:07:09,746
Come on, open it.

85
00:07:10,789 --> 00:07:12,040
Otherwise these will disappear.

86
00:07:35,438 --> 00:07:36,439
Have you finished tanning?

87
00:07:36,898 --> 00:07:38,066
Not yet.

88
00:07:46,282 --> 00:07:47,117
Finished?

89
00:07:47,325 --> 00:07:48,743
No, not yet.

90
00:07:49,285 --> 00:07:50,245
I thought...

91
00:07:54,165 --> 00:07:56,793
Maybe you won't come today.

92
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,253
Why?

93
00:07:59,963 --> 00:08:00,964
I just felt so.

94
00:08:02,674 --> 00:08:04,134
Do I look like...

95
00:08:07,303 --> 00:08:09,806
No, it's just a problem about myself.

96
00:08:14,853 --> 00:08:16,271
Wow wow, wa wa wait...

97
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,648
Are you thinking to finish it quickly?

98
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:22,777
Stop it.

99
00:08:23,862 --> 00:08:25,280
Stop it.

100
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:32,495
I'll get it.

101
00:08:37,709 --> 00:08:39,878
Hello, I've come to deliver your pizza.

102
00:08:43,673 --> 00:08:44,132
What?

103
00:08:46,509 --> 00:08:47,135
Oh,

104
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,347
Sorry, my apologies.

105
00:09:09,324 --> 00:09:10,700
Poor thing.

106
00:09:11,493 --> 00:09:12,160
What about?

107
00:09:13,244 --> 00:09:14,287
The delivery girl.

108
00:09:16,581 --> 00:09:18,041
She's working on this day,

109
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,503
and coming to the hotel alone for delivery.

110
00:09:23,254 --> 00:09:24,381
That sucks.

111
00:09:34,599 --> 00:09:36,768
What are you doing?

112
00:09:37,894 --> 00:09:38,895
I gotta make a phone call.

113
00:09:39,854 --> 00:09:40,397
Phone call?

114
00:09:41,106 --> 00:09:43,066
To my family

115
00:09:44,109 --> 00:09:45,694
in the countryside.

116
00:09:46,444 --> 00:09:48,905
I gotta say Merry Christmas to them.

117
00:09:51,408 --> 00:09:54,577
I'll wait for you at Hotel 555 room No. 304.

118
00:09:56,955 --> 00:09:58,707
You can call here.

119
00:10:01,793 --> 00:10:06,131
It's embarrassing to have someone listening to me
when I am talking to my family.

120
00:10:26,985 --> 00:10:29,320
How do you feel being alone in a lovehotel?

121
00:10:29,654 --> 00:10:30,447
Eh?

122
00:10:31,906 --> 00:10:34,117
And more so, on Christmas day.

123
00:10:37,412 --> 00:10:40,457
Um... it's sad.

124
00:10:42,667 --> 00:10:43,626
Yeah, it's sad.

125
00:10:49,924 --> 00:10:51,718
Wanna take a photo?

126
00:11:40,725 --> 00:11:41,976
You can open anything.

127
00:11:42,727 --> 00:11:44,187
It's all for you.

128
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:46,022
Ok.

129
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:56,741
To say the truth,

130
00:11:58,076 --> 00:12:02,497
I was worried that you may not come today.

131
00:12:04,082 --> 00:12:04,874
Why?

132
00:12:05,667 --> 00:12:07,085
When I asked you,

133
00:12:07,502 --> 00:12:10,922
you seemed to be considering a little bit.

134
00:12:13,425 --> 00:12:15,552
I didn't have much time.

135
00:12:15,927 --> 00:12:19,014
It was already Christmas when I asked you.

136
00:12:24,936 --> 00:12:25,979
That's nothing...

137
00:12:27,188 --> 00:12:31,776
I was spending Christmas all alone till this year.

138
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:33,987
Really?

139
00:12:37,115 --> 00:12:37,532
Yeah.

140
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,744
I was working last Christmas.

141
00:12:49,711 --> 00:12:50,211
I see.

142
00:12:51,588 --> 00:12:53,381
I'm glad to hear that

143
00:12:54,341 --> 00:12:55,967
You're such a cute girl.

144
00:12:57,802 --> 00:13:01,306
I thought you already have someone to spend the day.

145
00:13:01,931 --> 00:13:02,891
I was little worried.

146
00:13:04,601 --> 00:13:05,810
No, I don't.

147
00:13:13,318 --> 00:13:14,444
Oh, I'll get it.

148
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:25,246
Have you ordered pizza...

149
00:13:25,497 --> 00:13:26,289
Oh.

150
00:13:47,185 --> 00:13:48,311
Something happened?

151
00:13:50,772 --> 00:13:51,648
Suzuko?

152
00:13:55,485 --> 00:13:58,070
I was really working till this year.

153
00:14:03,493 --> 00:14:04,661
on Christmas...

154
00:14:06,621 --> 00:14:10,458
I was delivering pizza on Christmas like that girl.

155
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:13,503
Suzuko...

156
00:14:18,216 --> 00:14:21,261
I just didn't want to be alone on Christmas.

157
00:14:25,223 --> 00:14:26,683
I hate to be alone.

158
00:14:27,726 --> 00:14:28,893
on Christmas...

159
00:14:39,904 --> 00:14:42,532
I won't leave you alone.

160
00:16:27,178 --> 00:16:28,430
I'm sorry.

161
00:16:52,871 --> 00:16:53,913
Dear Kosuke,

162
00:16:54,497 --> 00:16:56,541
You were sleeping so soundly,

163
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,500
and I didn't want to wake you up, so I went home.

164
00:17:00,462 --> 00:17:01,880
See ya, Suzuko.

165
00:17:07,052 --> 00:17:08,303
Dear Sou,

166
00:17:08,511 --> 00:17:10,555
You were sleeping so soundly,

167
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:13,851
and I didn't want to wake you up, so I went home.
Thank you for the lovely presents.

168
00:17:14,476 --> 00:17:15,894
Love, Suzuko.

169
00:18:34,305 --> 00:18:36,891
Give me a little bit of that too.

170
00:19:00,457 --> 00:19:02,042
If I could...

171
00:19:02,917 --> 00:19:05,670
I wanna eat you.

172
00:19:07,464 --> 00:19:10,425
My love could make me eat you,

173
00:19:11,426 --> 00:19:13,303
I love you so much.

174
00:19:56,388 --> 00:19:58,014
Looks yummy.

175
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:59,808
Yeah, it does.

176
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,000
Hello?

177
00:21:10,795 --> 00:21:13,381
Hello, oh it's you, Sakura?

178
00:21:13,631 --> 00:21:16,134
Yes, it's me. Misaki?

179
00:21:16,134 --> 00:21:20,638
Of course it's me
It can't be the little one, can it?

180
00:21:21,139 --> 00:21:26,019
No, I suppose not... Is Toru there?

181
00:21:26,686 --> 00:21:28,938
Toru? Yes, he's here.

182
00:21:30,315 --> 00:21:35,111
Hey why don't you come over
sometime instead of just calling?

183
00:21:35,987 --> 00:21:38,656
We haven't got together since graduation.

184
00:21:39,282 --> 00:21:41,826
Yeah, ok I will.

185
00:21:44,329 --> 00:21:48,083
Anyway, are the cherry blossoms out over there?

186
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:51,252
Nope, not yet...

187
00:21:51,628 --> 00:21:53,880
Hmm well,

188
00:21:54,339 --> 00:21:58,468
we're planning on going over for a picnic,
so let me know when they're blooming.

189
00:21:59,427 --> 00:22:03,890
You should come and see us this time.
You missed it last year, but no more! Got it?

190
00:22:04,349 --> 00:22:06,101
Uh-huh

191
00:22:06,142 --> 00:22:08,853
Oh sorry, I'll get Toru. Hang on.

192
00:22:09,896 --> 00:22:11,147
Toru!

193
00:22:22,409 --> 00:22:26,246
Hello, it's me.

194
00:22:26,413 --> 00:22:27,664
You free today?

195
00:22:28,873 --> 00:22:30,458
I can't today...

196
00:22:33,336 --> 00:22:36,256
Toru, it's your birthday today, isn't it?

197
00:22:37,257 --> 00:22:38,675
Yeah...

198
00:22:40,885 --> 00:22:42,595
So for my birthday,

199
00:22:43,263 --> 00:22:46,558
my family are going out for dinner.

200
00:22:50,228 --> 00:22:51,354
I'm sorry.

201
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:53,231
No, no, it's OK.

202
00:22:54,566 --> 00:22:57,694
Sorry, I have a customer...

203
00:23:00,613 --> 00:23:01,239
ok I gotta go now.

204
00:23:04,784 --> 00:23:05,577
Hi,

205
00:23:06,244 --> 00:23:08,246
Do you have some cherries?

206
00:23:17,297 --> 00:23:19,174
Do you want some cherries?

207
00:23:29,934 --> 00:23:32,145
You can't right now.

208
00:23:35,607 --> 00:23:39,569
It's not in season yet...

209
00:23:42,989 --> 00:23:44,240
So when?

210
00:23:45,784 --> 00:23:49,788
Maybe just before summer.

211
00:23:53,917 --> 00:24:02,092
I know you want some right now,
but if you really want some, you have to wait.

212
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,761
So,

213
00:24:07,722 --> 00:24:09,516
Be patent , don't rush.

214
00:25:57,332 --> 00:26:02,045
You made me come after all...

215
00:26:38,373 --> 00:26:42,419
Why isn't daddy here? It's his birthday!

216
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:46,423
Daddy couldn't come home. He has to work.

217
00:26:47,632 --> 00:26:48,758
Why?

218
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,760
It happens sometimes.

219
00:26:51,136 --> 00:26:53,638
Why does it happen?

220
00:26:54,806 --> 00:26:56,057
Because daddy's a grown up.

221
00:26:56,307 --> 00:26:58,893
Hmm.

222
00:26:59,644 --> 00:27:00,979
It can't be helped.

223
00:27:01,021 --> 00:27:03,523
Let's go get something nice for dinner, just the two of us.

224
00:27:03,565 --> 00:27:04,816
Only the two of us?

225
00:27:06,192 --> 00:27:09,195
Well, I already made the reservation.

226
00:27:18,538 --> 00:27:21,124
This is a special present for you.

227
00:27:21,708 --> 00:27:26,671
We can't get them all the time, so I froze them.

228
00:27:30,342 --> 00:27:36,348
When I want some so much that I just can't wait,
I melt them to eat.

229
00:27:43,146 --> 00:27:44,439
Don't chew... Not yet...

230
00:27:46,274 --> 00:27:47,401
Yes,

231
00:27:48,151 --> 00:27:52,072
Take your time... Slowly...

232
00:27:53,531 --> 00:27:58,620
Let it melt slowly in your mouth.

233
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,835
Now it's OK. Go on.

234
00:29:23,246 --> 00:29:25,999
Daddy! Mommy, look! It's daddy!

235
00:29:26,249 --> 00:29:28,335
No way.

236
00:29:28,793 --> 00:29:30,420
Really, it's daddy. Over there.

237
00:29:31,755 --> 00:29:33,340
Where?

238
00:30:34,109 --> 00:30:35,735
Sorry.

239
00:33:37,584 --> 00:33:39,461
If I could...

240
00:33:44,549 --> 00:33:47,594
I wanna eat you.

241
00:34:06,112 --> 00:34:11,076
Maybe we shouldn't meet until things calm down.

242
00:34:14,412 --> 00:34:16,373
I'm OK.

243
00:34:17,082 --> 00:34:19,209
Leave me alone for a while.

244
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:24,422
when you...

245
00:34:27,967 --> 00:34:30,303
want to meet me again, call me.

246
00:35:48,923 --> 00:35:52,635
I'm sure that you will call me again.

247
00:35:55,013 --> 00:35:59,809
But I wonder how long it'll be.

248
00:36:02,354 --> 00:36:07,984
Three months? One year?

249
00:36:11,529 --> 00:36:16,534
Maybe you won't call me ever again.

250
00:36:22,957 --> 00:36:26,711
That's ok... just when you want to meet me.

251
00:36:29,047 --> 00:36:31,341
I've been patient.

252
00:36:33,802 --> 00:36:37,555
I'm just waiting for the season again.

253
00:36:40,433 --> 00:36:45,397
I'm sure that you will give me a call... definitely.

254
00:36:49,025 --> 00:36:54,072
Because, I could not live anymore if you don't.

255
00:36:58,410 --> 00:37:00,954
If I could,

256
00:37:01,913 --> 00:37:04,499
I wanna eat you.

257
00:37:07,293 --> 00:37:09,921
My love could make me eat you.

258
00:37:11,131 --> 00:37:12,757
I love you so much.

259
00:38:04,517 --> 00:38:07,103
Sometimes, you get really passionate because
you don't know much about your partner.

260
00:38:07,354 --> 00:38:08,605
Yeah, that happens sometimes.

261
00:38:08,813 --> 00:38:12,150
Some people just have sexual relationship, and that's all.

262
00:38:12,817 --> 00:38:16,571
Hello? You're just sitting there smoking.

263
00:38:16,863 --> 00:38:18,490
but I know about all your relationships.

264
00:38:18,823 --> 00:38:20,784
Wow you have that kind of relationships?

265
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:22,994
Yeah. there are girls that I can have good sex with.

266
00:38:23,203 --> 00:38:28,208
I mean sex is like your instinct. You can't resist it.

267
00:38:28,958 --> 00:38:30,210
So you don't try to control yourself?

268
00:38:30,543 --> 00:38:32,504
Why do I have to control myself?

269
00:38:33,338 --> 00:38:33,797
Wow! That's wonderful.

270
00:38:34,297 --> 00:38:35,340
Nice!

271
00:38:35,674 --> 00:38:37,967
Didn't you ever feel like you love the girl.

272
00:38:38,009 --> 00:38:42,514
Or like you want to go out with the girl?

273
00:38:42,889 --> 00:38:45,225
So, for you, it's always like having sex, feel ecstasy,

274
00:38:45,684 --> 00:38:50,188
And that's the end of it?

275
00:38:51,606 --> 00:38:53,483
Don't you ever feel like that?

276
00:38:53,817 --> 00:38:54,484
No, I don't.

277
00:38:54,984 --> 00:38:55,652
What? by sex?

278
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:56,986
Oh, I know what you mean.

279
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:03,159
So, if you never find another girl that you really like,

280
00:39:03,326 --> 00:39:05,870
then your partner is always your sexual companion?

281
00:39:06,329 --> 00:39:08,998
Maybe you won't break up with your sexual partner
even if you find somebody else?

282
00:39:09,374 --> 00:39:12,544
Because you get along so well sexually?

283
00:39:12,961 --> 00:39:15,005
Maybe I won't.

284
00:40:14,439 --> 00:40:18,777
Please. Make love to me just like you do all the time.

285
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,282
Sachi.

286
00:40:29,496 --> 00:40:31,706
Sachi.

287
00:40:36,294 --> 00:40:38,588
Sachi.

288
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,301
Sachi!

289
00:40:43,343 --> 00:40:45,637
It's OK, so just do it!

290
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:24,342
Taku has been a good friend of mine for a long time,

291
00:41:24,843 --> 00:41:28,638
But I guess he's more than a friend to me.

292
00:43:06,152 --> 00:43:08,613
I thought you were here.

293
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:10,740
You come back so suddenly.

294
00:43:10,865 --> 00:43:12,951
You angry?

295
00:43:13,368 --> 00:43:15,787
When are you gonna go away next time?

296
00:43:27,799 --> 00:43:30,760
I knew things would turn out this way

297
00:43:32,095 --> 00:43:37,642
Taku and I made love, desperately,
so many times throughout the summer.

298
00:43:37,851 --> 00:43:40,478
Just like we did a long time ago.

299
00:43:41,021 --> 00:43:42,856
2 months later

300
00:43:43,481 --> 00:43:48,611
Wow. It's finally here, huh? Took a long time, didn't it?

301
00:43:48,611 --> 00:43:49,738
Not that long.

302
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:52,115
Really? The summer's almost over.

303
00:43:52,282 --> 00:43:54,325
It's almost two months since you came back here.

304
00:43:54,993 --> 00:43:58,705
Whatever. I was pretty demanding on the colors.

305
00:44:00,665 --> 00:44:03,001
Well, yeah. That color is really great.

306
00:44:03,335 --> 00:44:05,378
Where did you take that picture?

307
00:44:06,838 --> 00:44:08,840
This? Cayman Islands in the Caribbean.

308
00:44:09,341 --> 00:44:14,346
Cayman Islands. I wish I could dive there, too.

309
00:44:15,722 --> 00:44:17,807
How long were you there, Taku?

310
00:44:18,391 --> 00:44:20,352
About three years, this time.

311
00:44:20,435 --> 00:44:23,021
Wow. That's too long!

312
00:44:23,229 --> 00:44:25,273
You should go there, too.

313
00:44:27,317 --> 00:44:29,069
I want to...

314
00:44:29,152 --> 00:44:31,237
but I can't take pictures like you.

315
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:33,907
And...

316
00:44:35,742 --> 00:44:38,328
I don't think this is such a bad place after all.

317
00:44:40,330 --> 00:44:42,749
I'm sorry! I'm a little late.

318
00:44:43,041 --> 00:44:45,043
OK then! Let's get going!

319
00:44:45,502 --> 00:44:47,420
I'll catch up with you guys later.

320
00:44:47,671 --> 00:44:49,089
I still have some pictures to put up on the wall.

321
00:44:49,381 --> 00:44:50,632
You need help?

322
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,926
Don't worry. Go ahead.

323
00:44:53,218 --> 00:44:55,011
Well, OK. Give us a call later.

324
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:55,887
All right.

325
00:44:55,929 --> 00:44:58,431
Sachi, let's get going.
The fireworks will start pretty soon.

326
00:44:58,556 --> 00:44:59,349
Ah... OK.

327
00:45:24,207 --> 00:45:27,961
What exactly is our relationship?

328
00:45:29,087 --> 00:45:31,381
Lovers?

329
00:45:31,423 --> 00:45:33,425
Friends?

330
00:45:34,968 --> 00:45:38,722
Sexual companion?

331
00:45:52,485 --> 00:45:55,071
I was watching what Taku was watching.

332
00:45:56,322 --> 00:45:59,075
I was feeling what Taku was feeling.

333
00:46:03,830 --> 00:46:08,084
We were not fnends.

334
00:46:08,543 --> 00:46:11,129
We were not lovers, either.

335
00:46:14,799 --> 00:46:21,765
I just wanted his existence and the assuring touch of his body.

336
00:46:26,811 --> 00:46:31,775
This boundlessly uncertain relationship between us continued.

337
00:46:33,651 --> 00:46:41,409
The touch of his body kept controlling me.

338
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:42,762
Why is Taku taking so long?

339
00:47:45,765 --> 00:47:49,200
You're right.

340
00:47:49,352 --> 00:47:53,648
I'll run over and take a look.
Wait here, Sachi, OK?

341
00:47:54,441 --> 00:47:55,775
OK.

342
00:48:02,741 --> 00:48:10,790
I realized that 70% of the world around me was dominated by
the touch of Taku's body and what I got from him.

343
00:48:14,461 --> 00:48:20,967
Just like 70% of the Earth is dominated by the ocean.

344
00:49:34,499 --> 00:49:40,755
Taku, please...

345
00:49:41,464 --> 00:49:43,717
Inside of me...

346
00:49:43,758 --> 00:49:47,637
Please come inside of me...

347
00:49:58,773 --> 00:50:04,821
What? What's wrong?

348
00:50:04,863 --> 00:50:08,491
I'm sorry...

349
00:50:08,533 --> 00:50:11,036
What? Taku?

350
00:50:13,288 --> 00:50:15,874
I can't do this.

351
00:50:19,377 --> 00:50:23,506
Taku?

352
00:50:54,329 --> 00:50:59,417
I'm sorry... I can't do this.

353
00:51:02,462 --> 00:51:06,424
Why? What's wrong?

354
00:51:15,642 --> 00:51:19,604
I'm in love with another girl.

355
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:26,820
What? What are you saying?

356
00:51:30,824 --> 00:51:33,785
Since when?

357
00:51:35,495 --> 00:51:38,100
Before I knew it...

358
00:51:38,123 --> 00:51:39,666
Before you knew?

359
00:51:39,874 --> 00:51:42,460
I don't know.

360
00:51:42,502 --> 00:51:45,005
OK! I just found myself in love with her!

361
00:51:45,130 --> 00:51:50,301
So you were thinking about her
when you were sleeping with me?

362
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:59,519
She is always on my mind recently.

363
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:13,366
Taku, this is great!
You take really beautiful pictures.

364
00:52:13,450 --> 00:52:15,952
Not that great.

365
00:52:16,661 --> 00:52:20,790
This is the first time we talk like this,
just with the two of us.

366
00:52:20,999 --> 00:52:26,129
Normally, other people are in the shop at this time of the day.

367
00:52:29,341 --> 00:52:34,346
What a coincidence, huh?

368
00:52:39,184 --> 00:52:44,189
It's not a coincidence.

369
00:52:51,821 --> 00:52:58,203
Did you sleep with that girl already?

370
00:52:58,536 --> 00:53:02,415
No I can't do such a thing with her.

371
00:53:02,957 --> 00:53:04,834
Why?

372
00:53:05,543 --> 00:53:08,880
Come on, tell me why!
Why can you sleep with me, but not with her?

373
00:53:10,757 --> 00:53:15,553
If nothing happens between us,
then there will never be an end to us.

374
00:53:17,389 --> 00:53:20,392
What the hell!

375
00:53:20,684 --> 00:53:26,523
I'm really scared.
I'm scared if she would love me forever.

376
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:31,277
Then what about me?

377
00:53:31,277 --> 00:53:34,072
You had sex with me so many'times!

378
00:53:34,447 --> 00:53:38,576
Having sex with you was really good.
I'm serious.

379
00:53:38,785 --> 00:53:44,374
Then why? What's wrong with it?
This is crazy! I just can't understand this!

380
00:53:44,374 --> 00:53:47,794
I can't understand it either.
I don't know what the hell I should do!

381
00:53:55,093 --> 00:54:00,181
You love the girl so much?

382
00:54:01,808 --> 00:54:05,729
Yeah, I love her.

383
00:54:08,023 --> 00:54:10,316
I love her so much that it feels like there's a pain in my heart.

384
00:54:11,317 --> 00:54:14,070
What's going on!

385
00:54:16,781 --> 00:54:19,659
I don't know what to do.

386
00:54:20,535 --> 00:54:23,747
What...

387
00:54:25,248 --> 00:54:28,209
I have never been in a serious relationship before!

388
00:54:28,793 --> 00:54:32,756
Even with you, I just suddenly found myself in such a relationship.

389
00:54:39,471 --> 00:54:41,973
I'm sorry.

390
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:52,567
I was just scared. I've never felt like this before.

391
00:54:55,653 --> 00:54:59,491
I'm sorry.

392
00:55:01,076 --> 00:55:03,703
Don't apologize.

393
00:55:09,834 --> 00:55:13,588
Why now?

394
00:55:39,572 --> 00:55:48,873
Taku was afraid to see the end of his relationship with another girl,
a relationship that hasn't even started.

395
00:55:51,042 --> 00:55:53,878
And he tried to run away from it.

396
00:55:56,047 --> 00:56:00,844
But... that's me.

397
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:22,282
Oh, you're back. Where's Taku?

398
00:56:24,159 --> 00:56:29,247
I think you should stop seeing Taku.

399
00:56:30,582 --> 00:56:33,168
But we're not really...

400
00:56:39,966 --> 00:56:43,803
How long are you gonna do this?

401
00:56:45,096 --> 00:56:47,599
Why can't you make it a true relationship?

402
00:56:55,106 --> 00:56:59,152
You know, Sachi, you can't be happy like this.

403
00:57:02,155 --> 00:57:08,411
You should stop seeing him.

404
00:57:18,630 --> 00:57:21,132
Can't I be the one for you?

405
00:57:25,178 --> 00:57:27,764
I've always loved you.

406
00:57:33,436 --> 00:57:37,190
I will definitely make you happy.

407
00:57:41,361 --> 00:57:43,947
Then...

408
00:57:45,490 --> 00:57:49,327
Please make me forget him.

409
00:57:50,161 --> 00:57:57,794
Please! Make me forget Taku!

410
00:58:35,415 --> 00:58:38,001
I promise I'll make you happy.

411
00:58:44,883 --> 00:58:47,469
I'll make you happy...

412
00:59:10,450 --> 00:59:13,078
Don't you have to answer it?

413
00:59:21,127 --> 00:59:26,299
You'll talk to Taku about us right?

414
00:59:43,775 --> 00:59:45,735
Hello, Taku?

415
00:59:45,777 --> 00:59:46,736
Please don't.

416
00:59:46,778 --> 00:59:48,863
Sachi is with me now.

417
00:59:48,988 --> 00:59:49,781
No!!

418
00:59:49,823 --> 00:59:53,243
Here? We're in a hotel, now.

419
00:59:53,284 --> 00:59:54,994
Yuji! Dont!

420
00:59:54,994 --> 00:59:56,746
So please break up with Sachi...

421
00:59:56,871 --> 00:59:58,123
No!!

422
01:00:03,795 --> 01:00:04,713
Sachi...

423
01:00:04,754 --> 01:00:06,798
Don't you dare do things like this!

424
01:00:11,803 --> 01:00:15,640
Sachi, you really love Taku so much...

425
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:29,446
Leave me alone.

426
01:00:31,114 --> 01:00:32,365
Sachi...

427
01:00:32,615 --> 01:00:34,868
Leave me alone!!

428
01:01:06,816 --> 01:01:12,322
I really really loved you Sachi.

429
01:01:18,453 --> 01:01:20,955
But I guess I should forget it.

430
01:02:02,205 --> 01:02:07,293
Hello... Taku...

431
01:02:07,627 --> 01:02:09,671
I want you to come here right now.

432
01:02:10,964 --> 01:02:14,843
Right now!

433
01:02:26,104 --> 01:02:34,946
Nothing started between us, but let's end it.

434
01:02:36,322 --> 01:02:39,034
You'll be fine, Taku.

435
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:48,918
You should go ahead and go to her place.

436
01:02:53,465 --> 01:02:58,970
And you should start a real relationship.

437
01:03:03,516 --> 01:03:08,688
And you will be happy...

438
01:03:15,862 --> 01:03:24,954
And she will love you so much...

439
01:03:28,291 --> 01:03:36,049
and I will find someone who...

440
01:03:44,766 --> 01:03:47,352
Why am I crying?

441
01:04:12,544 --> 01:04:15,088
For just one second,

442
01:04:15,088 --> 01:04:20,260
I felt the scent of his skin.

443
01:04:27,559 --> 01:04:30,145
Taku...

444
01:04:34,232 --> 01:04:36,818
I really love you.

445
01:04:55,086 --> 01:04:59,049
Sachi? Are you sure about it?

446
01:04:59,174 --> 01:05:00,425
Yes, I am!

447
01:05:01,301 --> 01:05:03,887
You serious? Really?

448
01:05:04,596 --> 01:05:08,183
Come on! I'm saying YES, aren't I?
I know what's going on.

449
01:05:08,183 --> 01:05:13,355
But it's the first time for me...

450
01:05:14,606 --> 01:05:18,943
It's the first time for me too...
I'm just fine with it as long as it's Taku.

451
01:05:20,487 --> 01:05:25,575
Well, then let's put it this way,
Taku and I are sexual companions!

452
01:05:25,575 --> 01:05:28,161
Then we don't have to care too much, right?

453
01:05:28,161 --> 01:05:30,747
Sexual companions?

454
01:05:31,539 --> 01:05:34,125
Yeah, just friends having sex.

455
01:05:54,396 --> 01:05:55,230
Ah, he's here!

456
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:56,231
Come sit here!

457
01:05:56,398 --> 01:05:59,818
please, come on ,come here!!!

458
01:05:59,859 --> 01:06:01,152
Don't bother.

459
01:06:01,152 --> 01:06:03,154
So, what were you guys talking about?

460
01:06:03,154 --> 01:06:04,614
Ah, you took a lot of pictures!

461
01:06:04,656 --> 01:06:07,575
Wow, you go right into the subject.

462
01:06:07,951 --> 01:06:12,163
Oh, I'm not interested in those kinds of girls.

463
01:06:12,497 --> 01:06:14,374
Oh, yeah! You gotta be kidding!

464
01:06:14,791 --> 01:06:16,668
I heard you play with a lot of girls, Haruki.

465
01:06:17,002 --> 01:06:21,339
My body just doesn't react to those kinds of girls.

466
01:06:21,673 --> 01:06:22,632
Are you sexually impotent or something?

467
01:06:22,966 --> 01:06:27,971
No way. I'm just saying that having sex isn't equal to making love.

468
01:06:29,472 --> 01:06:31,141
Having sex is just simply having sex.

469
01:06:32,183 --> 01:06:33,393
What did you say? What do you mean by making love?

470
01:06:33,518 --> 01:06:35,103
Making love is...

471
01:06:35,437 --> 01:06:37,355
like developing true love for someone.

472
01:06:38,189 --> 01:06:39,149
Like, she's the only one for me.

473
01:06:39,858 --> 01:06:40,608
Maybe like a twinge in your heart?

474
01:06:40,942 --> 01:06:41,651
Ah that's pretty close.

475
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:42,485
A twinge in your heart.

476
01:06:43,319 --> 01:06:45,155
And then you have hard on

477
01:06:45,363 --> 01:06:45,697
What?

478
01:06:47,657 --> 01:06:48,324
So it's like a twinge in your heart, right?

479
01:06:49,492 --> 01:06:50,326
Are you serious?

480
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:56,332
I really think that making love is how having sex should be.

481
01:06:56,332 --> 01:06:58,376
Now that's the real sex.

482
01:07:09,679 --> 01:07:13,200
There is a "love hotel" in my town.

483
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:16,728
This is the one and only "love hotel" in my town.

484
01:07:17,395 --> 01:07:22,025
So everybody knows about it.

485
01:07:22,901 --> 01:07:26,654
And my house is just behind this "love hotel".

486
01:07:26,780 --> 01:07:31,000
Actually, this "love hotel" was built in my house's backyard.

487
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:38,124
Well, in other words,
my dad is the owner of this "love hotel", which pisses me off.

488
01:07:39,417 --> 01:07:43,254
Today, my dad died.

489
01:07:45,715 --> 01:07:49,260
My mom passed away a long long time ago.

490
01:07:58,103 --> 01:08:03,233
Miss Ai, we are truly sorry for your loss...

491
01:08:04,442 --> 01:08:10,907
But we don't have the time to wail over your father's loss.

492
01:08:10,907 --> 01:08:17,956
Couples in this world will keep developing their love
no matter what happens, 24/7, 365 days a year.

493
01:08:17,956 --> 01:08:23,712
No holidays exist in the world of love!

494
01:08:23,712 --> 01:08:35,265
Therefore, we must keep operating our "love hotel".

495
01:08:35,306 --> 01:08:40,437
From now on, Miss Ai, the daughter of the deceased...

496
01:08:40,437 --> 01:08:42,439
Miss Ai!

497
01:08:43,606 --> 01:08:48,778
It is the dying will of your father!

498
01:08:52,282 --> 01:08:56,494
When I die, Ai will manage my love hotel.

499
01:08:57,662 --> 01:09:01,291
You gotta be kidding...

500
01:09:34,199 --> 01:09:38,703
Yes, the coupon card is inside the convenience box.

501
01:09:38,703 --> 01:09:42,707
You can use it from next time.

502
01:09:42,791 --> 01:09:44,709
Yes. Thank you very much.

503
01:09:47,712 --> 01:09:50,298
Phew...

504
01:09:51,049 --> 01:09:53,635
Yes, I think you're picking it up, Miss Ai.

505
01:09:53,677 --> 01:09:56,179
You have to learn the front line cutting edge.

506
01:09:56,429 --> 01:09:58,348
I know how to do it...

507
01:09:58,390 --> 01:10:02,102
Hmm That is an unforgivable remark!

508
01:10:02,143 --> 01:10:08,233
Just because you learned a little bit about your job,
that doesn't mean that you have learned about the front line.

509
01:10:08,566 --> 01:10:10,985
Then what do you mean by learning the front line?

510
01:10:11,194 --> 01:10:17,951
Let's put it this way... to know more about the people here.

511
01:10:19,369 --> 01:10:22,831
"Learning the front line" is to "know more about the people".

512
01:10:22,831 --> 01:10:25,917
I don't give shit about other people's sex life.

513
01:10:26,334 --> 01:10:28,586
Wow...

514
01:10:28,586 --> 01:10:30,046
How come there are so many people having sex

515
01:10:30,088 --> 01:10:32,757
at this time of the day?

516
01:10:33,758 --> 01:10:37,637
What are they doing for a living?

517
01:10:37,637 --> 01:10:41,766
What kind of people come here at such a time?

518
01:10:44,602 --> 01:10:49,357
Ai! Oh, please! Please don't say anything to the school!

519
01:10:49,774 --> 01:10:52,360
Don't worry I won't say anything.

520
01:10:52,485 --> 01:10:54,904
Your homeroom teacher was here yesterday, too.

521
01:10:55,071 --> 01:10:56,448
Don't worry.

522
01:11:03,413 --> 01:11:06,791
Oh my... Urasaka?

523
01:11:06,958 --> 01:11:08,084
Hi, Teacher.

524
01:11:08,126 --> 01:11:09,627
Why are you...

525
01:11:09,753 --> 01:11:10,920
This is my house.

526
01:11:11,129 --> 01:11:14,632
Oh please, Urasaka. Don't say anything to the school!

527
01:11:19,721 --> 01:11:23,600
Thanks toots.

528
01:11:33,777 --> 01:11:34,944
Hey, toots.

529
01:11:34,986 --> 01:11:36,654
How much?

530
01:11:38,198 --> 01:11:39,449
One hundred million.

531
01:11:57,133 --> 01:11:58,760
Ewww...

532
01:12:17,362 --> 01:12:19,280
Hey, watch me closely, OK?

533
01:12:19,864 --> 01:12:21,491
Come on, let's do it! Quick!

534
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:22,117
Yes!

535
01:12:24,828 --> 01:12:26,955
Hey girl, getting excited, huh?

536
01:12:33,837 --> 01:12:36,548
I've always loved you so much!

537
01:12:37,090 --> 01:12:38,341
Getting harder!!!

538
01:12:38,508 --> 01:12:39,676
I'm coming!! I'm coming!!

539
01:12:40,051 --> 01:12:41,136
Come on, give me more!!

540
01:12:41,594 --> 01:12:49,227
Why is everybody having sex?

541
01:13:12,083 --> 01:13:17,297
I used to come here and have sex all the time.

542
01:13:17,922 --> 01:13:20,717
With a different girl, every time.

543
01:13:23,762 --> 01:13:26,473
All young guys are like that.

544
01:13:27,515 --> 01:13:31,061
And then, one day, I got into this huge trouble.

545
01:13:31,269 --> 01:13:36,816
Some people are really strange,
and this one girl really, really fell in love with me.

546
01:13:37,942 --> 01:13:41,029
But, for me, it didn't mean anything.
And I was still doing bad things.

547
01:13:41,780 --> 01:13:44,032
I guess she couldn't forgive me.

548
01:13:44,616 --> 01:13:46,534
She started saying she's gonna die right away.

549
01:13:46,868 --> 01:13:49,162
And, you see that window?
She tried to jump off from that window.

550
01:13:49,662 --> 01:13:50,121
Oh my God!

551
01:13:51,164 --> 01:13:55,460
I tried to stop her immediately,
but she just kept yelling and crying.

552
01:13:55,669 --> 01:14:01,966
And this whole hotel was in a huge fuss.
The employees and everybody, they just gathered around her.

553
01:14:02,634 --> 01:14:10,058
Your dad took me to the office
and gave me this big lecture all night long.

554
01:14:12,185 --> 01:14:14,145
What did he say?

555
01:14:14,896 --> 01:14:18,483
He asked me if there is "love" in my sex.

556
01:14:19,150 --> 01:14:20,068
What?

557
01:14:20,318 --> 01:14:22,153
You see, he told me that he feels sorry for the girl
if I'm having sex without real love.

558
01:14:22,445 --> 01:14:24,072
Which is quite right.

559
01:14:24,614 --> 01:14:28,326
Having sex is a loving action between a man and woman.

560
01:14:28,702 --> 01:14:31,996
In English, you say "having sex" is to "make love", right?

561
01:14:33,707 --> 01:14:36,418
To "make love" is to have sex!

562
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:38,211
Hmmm.

563
01:14:38,503 --> 01:14:40,338
It really got to me.

564
01:14:40,588 --> 01:14:41,464
Sounds cool, doesn't it?

565
01:14:42,173 --> 01:14:43,049
No way.

566
01:14:43,508 --> 01:14:44,175
Yes it is cool.

567
01:14:44,801 --> 01:14:47,012
He said these embarassing words to me
without getting embarassed!

568
01:14:47,512 --> 01:14:49,681
Not many people can do such a thing!

569
01:14:51,182 --> 01:14:55,520
And then I found myself asking him to allow me to work here.

570
01:14:56,479 --> 01:14:57,188
Huh?

571
01:14:58,106 --> 01:15:01,985
From that day on, I promised myself
that there is nothing but to "make love".

572
01:15:03,528 --> 01:15:04,654
Wow.

573
01:15:05,530 --> 01:15:07,991
"Making love".

574
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:11,703
It just sounds wonderful.

575
01:15:12,996 --> 01:15:15,331
Hmm? From that day on?

576
01:15:15,874 --> 01:15:19,169
Two years? No, three?

577
01:15:19,461 --> 01:15:21,588
This is bad. This is getting real bad.

578
01:15:21,963 --> 01:15:22,339
What's bad?

579
01:15:22,505 --> 01:15:24,174
I haven't had sex for three years!

580
01:15:25,383 --> 01:15:26,468
Oh is it?

581
01:15:26,676 --> 01:15:29,179
This is bad. This is getting real bad.

582
01:15:29,846 --> 01:15:31,181
Well, then why don't you have sex with somebody?

583
01:15:31,389 --> 01:15:32,349
No way!

584
01:15:32,724 --> 01:15:33,725
No way!

585
01:15:34,267 --> 01:15:34,726
Why?

586
01:15:34,976 --> 01:15:35,477
Because...

587
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:40,357
I've got a crush on a girl.

588
01:15:42,776 --> 01:15:45,153
If I'm the only one in love, then it wouldn't mean
"making love" with each other, right?

589
01:15:47,572 --> 01:15:52,202
So I'm just waiting for the day to come
when we are in love with each other.

590
01:16:25,735 --> 01:16:27,404
Just the way it is.

591
01:16:31,616 --> 01:16:36,955
Just about a year has passed since my dad passed away.

592
01:16:37,831 --> 01:16:42,794
Which means that it's about a year
since I started working at the "love hotel".

593
01:16:43,628 --> 01:16:47,757
I've always thought that a "love hotel" is
a place for men and women to have sex,

594
01:16:48,133 --> 01:16:50,218
but I guess there's more to it.

595
01:16:50,802 --> 01:16:53,221
There are various types of people in this world.

596
01:16:53,805 --> 01:16:58,101
Some people make love by having sex,
but some people don't.

597
01:17:00,979 --> 01:17:03,940
Hey, Mr.! Is there anything wrong?
Would you please open the door?

598
01:17:03,982 --> 01:17:05,650
What's going on?

599
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:07,500
Miss Ai!

600
01:17:07,944 --> 01:17:12,741
We haven't been able to get in contact with
the customer here for more than a day.

601
01:17:15,076 --> 01:17:16,119
Open the door.

602
01:17:16,453 --> 01:17:18,955
Right away!

603
01:17:21,166 --> 01:17:24,002
Miss Ai, please go ahead!

604
01:17:25,003 --> 01:17:27,297
Please go ahead!

605
01:17:29,341 --> 01:17:30,967
Please!!

606
01:17:52,197 --> 01:17:55,617
Some people find pleasure in things other than sex.

607
01:18:20,684 --> 01:18:23,812
You didn't see anything did ya?

608
01:18:30,402 --> 01:18:33,154
You really didn't see anything, did ya?

609
01:18:34,698 --> 01:18:38,243
But these cases are really rare.

610
01:18:38,576 --> 01:18:43,748
Basically things are the same and
people are having sex all the time.

611
01:18:44,666 --> 01:18:47,752
It's just unbelievable how people are having sex all the time.

612
01:18:50,463 --> 01:18:55,260
Very long. Too long.

613
01:19:09,399 --> 01:19:12,610
In English, to "have sex" is to "make love"

614
01:19:13,486 --> 01:19:19,117
and it is an action of loving each other
between a man and a woman.

615
01:19:27,083 --> 01:19:28,626
Because I was born in such a family,

616
01:19:28,918 --> 01:19:31,963
I just didn't like the thought of having sex.

617
01:19:32,422 --> 01:19:35,967
and couldn't understand what "making love" was.

618
01:19:42,932 --> 01:19:44,100
What in the world is going on?

619
01:19:44,434 --> 01:19:46,144
Senior Mitsuru!

620
01:19:46,186 --> 01:19:50,315
Senior Mitsuru's next target must be Miss Urasaka.

621
01:19:50,648 --> 01:19:53,443
Oh my God! Unbelievable! Give my virginity back to me!

622
01:19:53,777 --> 01:19:55,320
What? You too?

623
01:19:55,528 --> 01:19:56,946
Ai you don't look so cute at first glance.

624
01:19:57,655 --> 01:20:00,492
especially to a guy like me, the school body president.

625
01:20:01,242 --> 01:20:02,243
But I think you'll look really good

626
01:20:02,827 --> 01:20:04,954
if you took your glasses off.

627
01:20:07,999 --> 01:20:08,625
OK, then,

628
01:20:10,126 --> 01:20:12,003
I think you'll look really cute.

629
01:20:14,047 --> 01:20:15,090
OK, whatever.

630
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:19,010
You look cute with your glasses on, too.

631
01:20:23,181 --> 01:20:28,937
Intelligent, talented in sport, extremely handsome,
and serving for everyone as the school body president...

632
01:20:29,354 --> 01:20:30,397
Will you go out with me?

633
01:20:32,691 --> 01:20:34,192
Ah, you will, won't you?

634
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:36,986
No, I won't.

635
01:20:37,696 --> 01:20:38,780
I'm not interested in you.

636
01:20:44,536 --> 01:20:50,208
I'm intelligent, talented in sports, extremely handsome,
and serving for everyone as the school body president...

637
01:20:51,001 --> 01:20:53,169
Oh, My Lord! Am I being dumped?

638
01:20:54,045 --> 01:20:56,047
I still find myself unnatural

639
01:20:56,548 --> 01:20:58,633
when I think about making love,

640
01:20:58,967 --> 01:21:02,804
or in fact when I even think about men and women.

641
01:21:16,735 --> 01:21:20,530
Ai, you're a virgin, aren't you?

642
01:21:28,371 --> 01:21:29,914
Don't tell me... Not even a kiss?

643
01:21:36,588 --> 01:21:40,925
Yeah, yeah, yeah... I'm almost a college student,
but still haven't experienced anything.

644
01:21:41,426 --> 01:21:43,553
What can I do about it.

645
01:21:44,095 --> 01:21:45,055
Fucking Dad!

646
01:21:54,856 --> 01:21:56,107
Bon appetit!!

647
01:22:10,955 --> 01:22:11,331
Yes?

648
01:22:11,414 --> 01:22:13,583
One Soba, please!

649
01:22:13,750 --> 01:22:18,463
Yes, I'll bring it to your room right away.

650
01:22:20,799 --> 01:22:21,758
Hey, Haruki!

651
01:22:22,926 --> 01:22:25,053
Can you bring Soba to the customer?

652
01:22:26,304 --> 01:22:27,555
Hey? Haruki?

653
01:22:32,477 --> 01:22:33,728
OK, then

654
01:22:38,483 --> 01:22:40,318
You don't know how to eat this, do you?

655
01:23:10,348 --> 01:23:11,599
Where's your mom?

656
01:23:17,230 --> 01:23:18,648
There's my mom.

657
01:23:21,526 --> 01:23:22,902
Most people will find it tiring

658
01:23:23,528 --> 01:23:25,530
when you keep seeing these kinds of things with your own eyes.

659
01:23:44,215 --> 01:23:48,511
There are, of course, a lot of happy men and women as well.

660
01:23:49,471 --> 01:23:53,350
And these people are having sex all the time.

661
01:23:54,184 --> 01:23:56,728
And these happy faces.

662
01:23:57,270 --> 01:24:01,024
Am I ever that happy?

663
01:24:03,193 --> 01:24:09,407
When I see these people in front of me,
I just feel uncomfortable.

664
01:24:10,408 --> 01:24:14,746
It's like, seeing someone solving formulas
with sine and cosine really quickly

665
01:24:15,246 --> 01:24:20,085
It's like, something I can't understand
but people in the world take it that way.

666
01:24:21,378 --> 01:24:26,758
To be honest, I envy that kind of person.
Maybe just a little bit.

667
01:24:28,426 --> 01:24:29,219
But...

668
01:24:32,097 --> 01:24:34,432
Come on everybody! "Have sex and become happy!"

669
01:24:34,766 --> 01:24:36,559
Have sex and become happy.

670
01:24:36,768 --> 01:24:37,852
Let's fly up to the blue sky!

671
01:24:38,061 --> 01:24:39,604
Have sex and become happy.

672
01:24:39,771 --> 01:24:40,563
Now happier!

673
01:24:40,772 --> 01:24:41,898
Have sex and become happy.

674
01:24:42,107 --> 01:24:43,191
Fly up to the blue sky!

675
01:24:43,650 --> 01:24:44,901
Have sex and become happy.

676
01:24:44,943 --> 01:24:46,319
Fly up to the blue sky!

677
01:24:46,569 --> 01:24:48,279
Have sex and become happy.

678
01:24:48,988 --> 01:24:52,033
I just can't solve this formula.

679
01:25:00,125 --> 01:25:01,376
Excuse me, Miss?

680
01:25:02,585 --> 01:25:06,172
My son wanna say thanks to you.

681
01:25:07,465 --> 01:25:08,425
Ah, yes.

682
01:25:14,347 --> 01:25:16,850
Hey, come here for a second.

683
01:25:19,644 --> 01:25:21,229
Face this way just a little bit.

684
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:47,505
This was my first kiss.

685
01:25:47,839 --> 01:25:50,425
Yeah, it was from a kid...

686
01:25:51,634 --> 01:25:55,388
But I guess kissing isn't that bad.

687
01:25:56,639 --> 01:26:00,310
Next, Ai Urasaka.

688
01:26:00,352 --> 01:26:02,979
Solve that problem on the board.

689
01:26:55,907 --> 01:26:57,158
Bring more drinks someone! Drinks!

690
01:26:57,367 --> 01:26:58,910
OK, I got it! So who said you can throw things?

691
01:26:59,369 --> 01:27:00,912
Oh my god!

692
01:27:01,246 --> 01:27:02,747
I gotta go pee!

693
01:27:04,082 --> 01:27:05,667
Bathroom's over there.

694
01:27:06,835 --> 01:27:09,754
So where's our food?

695
01:27:10,088 --> 01:27:12,257
I'll bring some food later, OK?

696
01:27:13,967 --> 01:27:15,885
Oh shit.

697
01:27:27,731 --> 01:27:34,446
Wow. Miss Ai,
you look really beautiful today. Ho ho!

698
01:27:36,698 --> 01:27:38,450
Ah! I found ya, Haruki!

699
01:27:38,742 --> 01:27:39,826
Oh! Hey, Tomomi!

700
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:46,416
I've always thought that you're quite charming!

701
01:27:46,708 --> 01:27:47,751
Let's do something exciting!

702
01:27:48,126 --> 01:27:50,295
Oh no! Please don't! Tomomi!

703
01:27:52,088 --> 01:27:53,423
I'm not that different from usual.

704
01:27:53,715 --> 01:27:56,092
No, no. You look so quite different today, Ai.

705
01:27:59,220 --> 01:28:02,223
Ah! Two fried noodles, please!

706
01:28:06,978 --> 01:28:07,937
Ai is gonna come!

707
01:28:08,313 --> 01:28:10,523
Come on, don't be such a hard-head!

708
01:28:10,940 --> 01:28:12,984
Oh, I want you to be hard here though!

709
01:28:13,818 --> 01:28:14,569
It's already hard!!

710
01:28:15,111 --> 01:28:16,613
Well, then!

711
01:28:17,489 --> 01:28:22,118
I know everything you've done with many girls

712
01:28:22,994 --> 01:28:23,495
you know.

713
01:28:23,995 --> 01:28:26,081
Tomomi! I quit doing that kind of things!

714
01:28:29,668 --> 01:28:30,001
Why?

715
01:28:31,336 --> 01:28:33,338
Are you in love with somebody, or something?

716
01:28:35,674 --> 01:28:36,216
YES!

717
01:28:38,259 --> 01:28:41,680
Don't worry. That doesn't matter to me at all!

718
01:28:42,055 --> 01:28:43,264
Hello? Are you listening to me?

719
01:28:43,682 --> 01:28:46,059
OK I got it!

720
01:28:46,184 --> 01:28:48,978
No, no, stop it. I wanna make love but not with you, Tomomi.

721
01:28:49,479 --> 01:28:51,439
Watch out!!

722
01:28:58,697 --> 01:28:58,988
*gasp*

723
01:29:00,865 --> 01:29:02,450
Haruki... What are you doing?

724
01:29:03,952 --> 01:29:06,454
Ai... Why are you dressed up today?

725
01:29:06,955 --> 01:29:08,498
Why am I dressed up?

726
01:29:08,998 --> 01:29:10,709
Is it wrong for me to dress up?

727
01:29:11,042 --> 01:29:13,086
I have to tell you I didn't do this for you OK?

728
01:29:13,586 --> 01:29:15,463
I did not dress up for you, OK?

729
01:29:15,714 --> 01:29:17,590
I didn't even dress up or anything!

730
01:29:18,091 --> 01:29:19,342
I am just as usual!

731
01:29:19,551 --> 01:29:20,802
I think you have the wrong idea!

732
01:29:21,052 --> 01:29:22,178
I didn't say anything like that...

733
01:29:22,220 --> 01:29:23,179
I didn't say anything like that either...

734
01:29:23,847 --> 01:29:24,681
What? What are you saying?

735
01:29:24,848 --> 01:29:26,516
AHHH! SHUT UP!

736
01:29:29,894 --> 01:29:31,479
I'm sorry, I have to go.

737
01:29:32,230 --> 01:29:33,064
Bye, Tomomi?

738
01:29:33,565 --> 01:29:35,900
Ai! I think there's a misunderstanding!!

739
01:29:36,234 --> 01:29:38,570
Good for you! I guess you found somebody to make love with.

740
01:29:38,570 --> 01:29:39,821
No, it's nothing like that!

741
01:29:40,238 --> 01:29:43,658
You have lipstick all over you!

742
01:29:45,243 --> 01:29:46,494
This is really stupid!

743
01:29:47,078 --> 01:29:48,329
You suck!

744
01:29:50,373 --> 01:29:54,753
She's the one who put this all over me!
It's nothing like that

745
01:29:55,045 --> 01:29:55,962
Nothing like that?

746
01:29:56,629 --> 01:30:00,258
Ah I see. It's just having sex and not making love.

747
01:30:02,093 --> 01:30:04,054
Ahh! NO!!

748
01:30:05,263 --> 01:30:06,514
You just want to have sex after all!

749
01:30:06,890 --> 01:30:08,099
No, that's wrong! Please listen to me!

750
01:30:09,142 --> 01:30:10,393
You're the one that I love!

751
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:11,978
I will never have sex with you!

752
01:30:15,398 --> 01:30:18,109
I didn't say anything about having sex...

753
01:30:22,989 --> 01:30:23,490
Ah

754
01:30:47,806 --> 01:30:48,890
Hey, veteran?

755
01:30:49,391 --> 01:30:50,392
Yes?

756
01:30:51,643 --> 01:30:55,772
Why do girls get so angry all of a sudden?

757
01:30:57,273 --> 01:31:00,402
Ho ho ho! I guess you still don't understand women.

758
01:31:01,194 --> 01:31:01,945
Understand women?

759
01:31:02,487 --> 01:31:07,659
Women are as fickle as autumn weather.
Very fickle, they are.

760
01:31:07,992 --> 01:31:08,743
That's why?

761
01:31:09,119 --> 01:31:14,124
Asking why doesn't solve anything, you know.

762
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:16,918
What? Then what should I do?

763
01:31:17,794 --> 01:31:20,505
Just a little thing can turn into sunshine

764
01:31:20,964 --> 01:31:25,176
and just a little thing can turn into rain.

765
01:31:26,678 --> 01:31:27,470
Veteran...

766
01:31:28,638 --> 01:31:29,681
I don't understand what you're trying to say.

767
01:31:32,642 --> 01:31:34,436
If you want to be in a good relationship with a woman,

768
01:31:35,020 --> 01:31:38,314
A bit of gentleness will be very important.

769
01:31:38,940 --> 01:31:39,941
Gentleness?

770
01:31:40,608 --> 01:31:41,526
For example,

771
01:31:42,360 --> 01:31:49,034
Don't you ever forget her birthday,
Christmas, and other anniversaries!

772
01:31:49,159 --> 01:31:51,202
That is so foolish.

773
01:31:51,494 --> 01:31:55,206
From a man's point of view it may seem quite foolish.

774
01:31:56,750 --> 01:32:05,383
But, if you buy a bottle of wine and some flowers
and give a word of appreciation to your girlfriend...

775
01:32:05,383 --> 01:32:07,844
She will be moved by such small ceIebrations.

776
01:32:08,428 --> 01:32:09,763
Are you sure?

777
01:32:09,763 --> 01:32:11,014
I'm sure about that.

778
01:32:11,931 --> 01:32:17,562
Yes. Just like a ray of sunshine,
a bright smile will appear on her face.

779
01:32:18,855 --> 01:32:20,106
Oh.

780
01:32:20,440 --> 01:32:26,029
Well, I should be going now.
I have something important to do.

781
01:32:26,988 --> 01:32:29,866
Tomorrow is an extremely important day...

782
01:32:30,575 --> 01:32:32,369
What? What about tomorrow?

783
01:32:32,911 --> 01:32:34,996
You know it, don't you?

784
01:32:35,455 --> 01:32:42,587
It's the first anniversary for Miss Ai.

785
01:33:11,055 --> 01:33:12,500
Hotel Completion Anniversary
- Papa & Mama & Ai -

786
01:33:47,255 --> 01:33:49,500
Hi Ai! It's me! Your daddy!

787
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:54,387
I guess I must be dead by now,
now that you're watching this film.

788
01:33:55,455 --> 01:33:56,587
Long time no see!

789
01:33:57,287 --> 01:33:58,887
Well, now that you're watching this film,

790
01:33:59,587 --> 01:34:02,387
It means that tomorrow is the 1st anniversary
since you took over this "love hotel".

791
01:34:02,887 --> 01:34:05,387
I believe you're working quite hard.

792
01:34:07,087 --> 01:34:08,800
I really want to thank you, Ai.

793
01:34:09,500 --> 01:34:15,200
But sometimes, you try to take all the
responsibilities and have a hard time.

794
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:17,200
Don't force yourself too much.

795
01:34:18,055 --> 01:34:22,700
Well, maybe your boyfriend is cheering you up now!

796
01:34:23,500 --> 01:34:26,200
Wow! You cutie pie!

797
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:28,700
That has nothing to do with you...

798
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:32,500
Did you see mom and dad kissing? Lovely, huh?

799
01:34:32,700 --> 01:34:35,100
I was able to survive because of your mom.

800
01:34:35,900 --> 01:34:42,000
Well, I just wanted to say that you can be happier than ever
if your loved one is beside you.

801
01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:51,500
So, be good to your boyfriend. With tons of hugs and kisses.

802
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:57,500
Huh? You understand that?

803
01:35:07,300 --> 01:35:09,500
Tomorrow is the first anniversary...

804
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:19,300
Ai! Banzai!

805
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,200
Ai! Well done!

806
01:35:23,300 --> 01:35:26,000
You've worked hard, Ai!

807
01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:33,000
This sucks.

808
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:42,000
I can't go down from here.

809
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,700
Haruki!

810
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,900
Hey, Haruki!

811
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:00,700
We just had an order...

812
01:36:01,500 --> 01:36:03,200
Where the hell is he?

813
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:13,000
Long. Too long.

814
01:36:23,100 --> 01:36:25,400
Haruki! He must be sleeping again.

815
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:28,500
Haruki!

816
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,800
Hey, Haruki!

817
01:36:43,700 --> 01:36:46,400
Happy anniversary, Ai!

818
01:36:54,200 --> 01:36:55,100
Eh?

819
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:07,900
Well, Ai, you've been working here for a year
and today's the first anniversary, so...

820
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:30,000
Thank you.

821
01:37:30,500 --> 01:37:31,700
Uh-huh.

822
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:43,000
Eh... Was that your first kiss?

823
01:37:44,500 --> 01:37:46,500
Not exactly the first...

824
01:37:48,500 --> 01:37:50,500
But the second one was...

825
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:55,200
A lot better than the first one.

826
01:37:57,500 --> 01:37:59,200
In this kind of situation...

827
01:38:00,300 --> 01:38:01,500
Yeah?

828
01:38:02,500 --> 01:38:04,500
Do you feel that you want to sleep with me?

829
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:07,500
Ah, yeah...

830
01:38:09,500 --> 01:38:11,000
Of course I do.

831
01:38:12,500 --> 01:38:14,000
Desperately?

832
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,500
Desperately.

833
01:38:18,300 --> 01:38:20,000
Are you trying to control yourself?

834
01:38:20,500 --> 01:38:25,500
Well, I guess I'm trying to.

835
01:38:32,200 --> 01:38:37,900
Do you remember how much it
is to spend a night in this room?

836
01:38:58,200 --> 01:39:00,300
You don't have to go too far, you know.

837
01:39:01,200 --> 01:39:04,300
Um... I know.

838
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:09,500
We'll just go step by step.

839
01:39:11,200 --> 01:39:13,200
Yeah, step by step.

840
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:17,800
We have a long night ahead of us.

841
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:21,200
Yeah.

842
01:39:57,700 --> 01:40:01,200
Just get undressed and it makes your heart twinge.

843
01:40:02,200 --> 01:40:03,200
So will your girlfriend.

844
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:04,300
Are you sure about that?

845
01:40:04,300 --> 01:40:05,500
Really?

846
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:07,200
I don't think so! Not so suddenly.

847
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:18,800
OK, OK. Hold on guys.

848
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:20,000
It's truly necessary. It's the ultimate.

849
01:40:20,600 --> 01:40:22,900
It's truly necessary.

850
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Even God...

851
01:40:27,500 --> 01:40:32,000
Even God wants to see that kind of things... live.

852
01:40:32,200 --> 01:40:33,800
Really? Do you think that God wants to see that?

853
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:35,000
Yeah, of course.

854
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
That's why human beings were separated into men and women.

855
01:40:37,400 --> 01:40:39,000
Then Adam and Eve were pretty satisfying for God, I guess.

856
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:41,000
Really?

857
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:42,000
Adam and Eve.

858
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:43,300
So which one was Adam?

859
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:45,300
I think the guy is Adam.

860
01:40:45,800 --> 01:40:46,500
So Adam...

861
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:48,400
Cut! OK!
