General!

8
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:03,743
There are too many of them!

9
00:02:03,743 --> 00:02:05,567
We must retreat, sir!

10
00:02:05,567 --> 00:02:07,968
What? Retreat?

11
00:02:07,968 --> 00:02:10,752
We must fight them off
until the main army gets here!

12
00:02:10,752 --> 00:02:13,407
It's been 5 days, sir!
If they were coming...

13
00:02:13,407 --> 00:02:15,135
What are you suggesting?

14
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,029
Sir!

15
00:02:17,055 --> 00:02:18,616
Enough nonsense.

16
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,094
No one moves a step
until the main army gets here!

17
00:02:58,591 --> 00:02:59,966
Damn it.

18
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,494
Are you okay, Do-young?

19
00:03:37,247 --> 00:03:38,495
I'm fine.

20
00:03:38,495 --> 00:03:40,127
This won't kill me.

21
00:03:40,127 --> 00:03:43,389
Damn Ching bastards!
Why are there so many?

22
00:03:55,167 --> 00:03:56,247
Oh shit!

Do-young!

26
00:04:32,767 --> 00:04:33,661
Wake up!

27
00:04:34,783 --> 00:04:35,677
Wake up!

28
00:04:45,631 --> 00:04:46,809
Don't fall asleep!

29
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,269
If you do, you'll die!

30
00:04:51,103 --> 00:04:53,787
Wake up! Open your eyes!

31
00:04:55,007 --> 00:04:57,909
I can't... feel my left leg.

32
00:04:58,847 --> 00:04:59,927
I'm sure it's fine.

33
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,071
It's probably from the cold.

34
00:05:03,071 --> 00:05:05,759
If we warm up,
it'll get better.

35
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,818
So pull yourself together
and point the way home.

36
00:05:28,768 --> 00:05:29,750
I wonder...

37
00:05:31,167 --> 00:05:33,687
what happened to
the other Joseon soldiers.

38
00:05:34,815 --> 00:05:36,376
Probably all died, right?

39
00:05:41,695 --> 00:05:45,885
Weren't we all sent here
to die anyways?

40
00:05:46,527 --> 00:05:47,956
Just go...

41
00:05:48,735 --> 00:05:50,491
and all die.

42
00:05:54,495 --> 00:05:55,542
I guess...

43
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:59,862
our army's duty
has been fulfilled.

44
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:06,684
Oh, not quite yet.

45
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:14,077
You and l... are still alive.

46
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:26,239
It's not funny.
Stop the nonsense.

47
00:06:26,239 --> 00:06:28,922
You really think
I'm just joking?

48
00:06:39,456 --> 00:06:44,092
At last,
I shall die because of you.

49
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,759
I don't understand you.

50
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:28,672
Isn't JANG Do-young your friend
whom you think of as a brother?

51
00:07:28,672 --> 00:07:29,632
So...

52
00:07:29,632 --> 00:07:34,421
When the So-beuk Clan and
his father were purged...

53
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,323
You desperately begged
to spare his life.

54
00:07:40,255 --> 00:07:44,767
But why change the army list...

55
00:07:44,767 --> 00:07:47,455
and insist on taking him?

56
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:50,239
Do-young often went to Ming

57
00:07:50,239 --> 00:07:52,927
with his father
when he was young.

58
00:07:52,927 --> 00:07:55,327
He knows the battle area well.

59
00:07:55,327 --> 00:07:58,905
That's the only reason
I chose him as a section chief.

60
00:08:01,183 --> 00:08:02,077
Really?

61
00:08:03,487 --> 00:08:04,632
Is that so?

62
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:06,973
Yes, sir.

63
00:08:10,463 --> 00:08:13,343
Do as you wish.

64
00:08:13,343 --> 00:08:14,717
Think about it.

65
00:08:16,799 --> 00:08:18,815
If you didn't tell me

66
00:08:18,815 --> 00:08:21,695
to take the military examination...

67
00:08:21,695 --> 00:08:27,860
I wouldn't be out here
to die like this.

68
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:32,628
What? Am I wrong?

69
00:08:36,191 --> 00:08:39,639
Nonsense!
No one is going to die!

70
00:08:44,415 --> 00:08:45,789
We can survive!

71
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:50,586
We'll surely live and step on
Joseon ground again!

72
00:09:15,231 --> 00:09:17,239
I can't... Not like this...

73
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:39,423
Traitor, JANG Soo-in!

74
00:10:39,423 --> 00:10:40,852
Seize him!

75
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:59,164
I can't just leave the bastards
and die like this.

76
00:11:02,239 --> 00:11:07,738
Not without getting revenge.

77
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:14,461
How will I face my father?

78
00:12:33,823 --> 00:12:35,099
Look, Do-young.

79
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:38,365
There's something
I must tell you.

80
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,351
It's been killing me.

81
00:12:47,359 --> 00:12:50,620
The one you've been
searching for...

82
00:12:51,807 --> 00:12:53,781
The one who accused
your father of treason...

83
00:12:56,511 --> 00:12:57,438
That person...

84
00:13:02,046 --> 00:13:03,573
That was me.

85
00:13:12,766 --> 00:13:15,483
So? Have you made a decision?

86
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:18,399
But, sir...

87
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,415
He's like a father to me.

88
00:13:20,415 --> 00:13:25,246
Your family belongs to
the Dae-beuk Clan like us!

89
00:13:25,246 --> 00:13:28,312
How can you call the enemy that?

90
00:13:31,358 --> 00:13:33,855
Ignorant fool.

91
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:35,102
So?

92
00:13:35,102 --> 00:13:37,311
What will you do?

93
00:13:37,311 --> 00:13:42,046
Die with him because
he was like a father to you?

94
00:13:45,854 --> 00:13:50,462
Now that we have
His Majesty's trust...

95
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:54,302
It's only a matter of time
till we gain control of the court.

96
00:13:54,302 --> 00:14:00,053
Is it not a heavenly opportunity
for you to join us?

97
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:04,671
Why you!

98
00:14:04,671 --> 00:14:05,619
Leave him.

99
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,863
He wants to die with them.

100
00:14:08,863 --> 00:14:09,756
You are dismissed!

101
00:14:11,007 --> 00:14:13,567
I'll do it! I'll do it, sir!

102
00:14:13,567 --> 00:14:14,461
Please give me the chance!

103
00:14:20,574 --> 00:14:23,389
But, promise me one thing, sir.

104
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,871
I told you not to worry
about your future.

105
00:14:27,871 --> 00:14:29,147
It's not that, sir.

106
00:14:31,326 --> 00:14:32,220
Please...

107
00:14:33,631 --> 00:14:34,776
Not him...

108
00:14:36,511 --> 00:14:37,852
Please spare his life.

109
00:14:39,935 --> 00:14:41,789
I beg you, sir!

110
00:14:45,022 --> 00:14:46,583
I shouldn't have done it.

111
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:51,197
I'm sorry.

112
00:14:53,662 --> 00:14:54,939
So sorry.

113
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,685
Please...

114
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,005
kill me.

115
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:55,292
Cold!

116
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,172
What the?

117
00:17:00,831 --> 00:17:02,009
Damn it!

118
00:19:15,198 --> 00:19:16,573
Do-young...

119
00:19:20,286 --> 00:19:21,180
You...

120
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,445
Are you all right?

121
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:35,252
We should hurry.

122
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,037
Will you?

123
00:21:44,606 --> 00:21:46,166
Why did I come down here?

124
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:52,022
Shit.

125
00:22:04,702 --> 00:22:07,157
Why did they make
something like this?

126
00:22:07,742 --> 00:22:10,230
What are they, mice?

127
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:15,324
I'm beat.

128
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:48,888
Someone's inside.

129
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:06,813
We're still in enemy territory.

130
00:24:10,494 --> 00:24:13,593
Damn Ching bastard!

131
00:24:19,518 --> 00:24:20,542
Are you a Joseon soldier?

132
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:21,694
Are you a Joseon soldier, too?

133
00:24:21,694 --> 00:24:22,588
Yes!

134
00:24:23,806 --> 00:24:25,534
Military rules are strict!

135
00:24:25,534 --> 00:24:28,318
Anyone who dares runaway
from the battlefield

136
00:24:28,318 --> 00:24:30,107
shall be beheaded!

137
00:24:32,158 --> 00:24:33,620
How ever did you survive?

138
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:37,849
What a relief
meeting one of our men here.

139
00:24:51,166 --> 00:24:52,060
Hey, Do-young!

140
00:25:13,214 --> 00:25:14,774
Damn bastards.

141
00:25:15,422 --> 00:25:16,949
Just my damn luck!

142
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:33,274
What's with the damn door!

143
00:25:34,494 --> 00:25:36,436
The bastards don't move a finger.

144
00:25:45,758 --> 00:25:48,441
I cleaned up like you said, sir.

145
00:25:55,902 --> 00:25:56,851
Then I'll just...

146
00:26:05,694 --> 00:26:09,310
It's been frozen good,
so it'll be okay to eat.

147
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,846
There's not much...

148
00:26:10,846 --> 00:26:14,398
But it should last us

149
00:26:14,398 --> 00:26:18,075
maybe two days or so, sir.

150
00:26:22,846 --> 00:26:25,246
Why's this here?

151
00:26:25,246 --> 00:26:26,523
Let's put it in the soup.

152
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,838
It's quite a big tavern.

153
00:26:31,838 --> 00:26:33,398
Yes, sir.

154
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:38,678
Merchants who traveled between
Joseon and Ming stayed here.

155
00:26:39,646 --> 00:26:42,428
Looks like they were done in
by bandits during the war.

156
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:46,718
Do you know this area?

157
00:26:46,718 --> 00:26:50,296
Not much, Just a little, sir.

158
00:26:50,654 --> 00:26:53,246
Joseon's three or four days away.

159
00:26:53,246 --> 00:26:55,101
Really? Are you sure?

160
00:26:56,126 --> 00:26:57,950
Damn sure!

161
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,678
I made money as a guide
to the merchants here.

162
00:26:59,678 --> 00:27:01,783
You were a guide around here?

163
00:27:04,254 --> 00:27:09,175
Then you can go to Joseon
with your eyes closed, right?

164
00:27:23,582 --> 00:27:26,516
By the way,
were you in my unit?

165
00:27:27,678 --> 00:27:28,725
You look familiar.

166
00:27:29,885 --> 00:27:31,314
Damn hot!

167
00:27:34,654 --> 00:27:35,806
No, sir.

168
00:27:35,806 --> 00:27:37,150
I was...

169
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:38,612
in the central unit, sir!

170
00:27:39,646 --> 00:27:40,922
Looks good, doesn't it?

171
00:27:43,486 --> 00:27:44,541
Are you hungry, sir?

172
00:27:44,541 --> 00:27:46,963
It's all ready to eat.

173
00:27:54,046 --> 00:27:56,158
Smells great, doesn't it?

174
00:27:56,158 --> 00:27:57,336
There's more, sir.

175
00:28:00,766 --> 00:28:02,522
Let's give it a try.

176
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:10,334
Hey!

177
00:28:10,334 --> 00:28:12,830
You think people can eat this?

178
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:15,326
Why? Isn't it good, sir?

179
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:17,268
It should be okay.

180
00:28:18,974 --> 00:28:19,934
Let me try it, sir!

181
00:28:19,934 --> 00:28:21,395
Get your filthy hand away!

182
00:28:24,094 --> 00:28:26,582
Forget it.
It'll have to do.

183
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:37,214
Damn aristocrat bastards.

184
00:28:37,214 --> 00:28:39,123
Complaining about food
at a time like this?

185
00:28:44,669 --> 00:28:49,662
They should starve like hell
to appreciate my porridge,

186
00:28:49,662 --> 00:28:52,761
and realize their mouths
aren't coated with gold!

187
00:28:53,917 --> 00:28:55,641
Starve to death,
you damn bastards!

188
00:30:40,254 --> 00:30:41,789
Shit.

189
00:30:41,789 --> 00:30:43,797
Can't tell which way is which.

190
00:30:51,934 --> 00:30:52,828
Bastards.

191
00:31:16,509 --> 00:31:18,517
What? It's not this way?

192
00:32:04,349 --> 00:32:05,626
Not this way, either?

193
00:32:09,374 --> 00:32:12,341
Damn! I'll freeze to death.

194
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:02,270
Where have you been?

195
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:04,691
Just outside, sir.

196
00:33:06,205 --> 00:33:07,482
I had to pee.

197
00:33:12,253 --> 00:33:15,805
Then, why pull out your hatchet?

198
00:33:15,805 --> 00:33:16,950
Planning on hacking someone?

199
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:21,086
Of course not, sir.
Just got a little startled.

200
00:33:21,086 --> 00:33:22,995
I wouldn't dream of it.

201
00:33:24,189 --> 00:33:27,421
It's really cold outside.

202
00:33:27,421 --> 00:33:29,630
Look at this.

203
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:30,578
It's damn cold.

204
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:32,765
The fire has died down.

205
00:33:32,765 --> 00:33:36,148
I'll put in more wood, sir!

206
00:33:38,622 --> 00:33:39,418
Hey!

207
00:33:41,917 --> 00:33:44,285
There's wood here, too.
Where are you going?

208
00:33:44,285 --> 00:33:48,442
Ah, I left some broken
wood pieces in the room.

209
00:34:00,798 --> 00:34:04,343
That fool's got something up
his sleeve.

210
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:15,292
Why?

211
00:34:17,662 --> 00:34:20,446
Do you have
something to say to me?

212
00:34:20,446 --> 00:34:21,428
Me?

213
00:34:22,845 --> 00:34:24,700
No. Nothing.

214
00:34:45,853 --> 00:34:47,610
Did he hear everything I said?

215
00:34:51,613 --> 00:34:52,791
No.

216
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:57,595
If he did, he wouldn't
stay still like that.

217
00:35:28,829 --> 00:35:29,982
Stop!

218
00:35:29,982 --> 00:35:30,876
That's enough!

219
00:35:35,773 --> 00:35:37,277
Not again!

220
00:35:37,277 --> 00:35:38,804
Don't over do it!

221
00:35:49,341 --> 00:35:51,381
You're always like this!

222
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:55,412
I'm sorry.

223
00:35:56,158 --> 00:35:57,693
I pushed a little too far.

224
00:35:57,693 --> 00:36:01,437
Must you go so far
to be damn satisfied?

225
00:36:01,437 --> 00:36:03,197
I was too rough.
Forgive me.

226
00:36:03,197 --> 00:36:04,894
Are you really sorry?

227
00:36:04,894 --> 00:36:06,650
You're always like this.

228
00:36:13,821 --> 00:36:15,998
Good swordsmanship
is important,

229
00:36:15,998 --> 00:36:18,997
but do not neglect
your studies.

230
00:36:19,742 --> 00:36:22,526
Remember,
books before the sword.

231
00:36:22,526 --> 00:36:23,773
Yes, sir.

232
00:36:23,773 --> 00:36:26,970
Thus, I am studying hard
at both, sir.

233
00:36:28,765 --> 00:36:29,659
Good.

234
00:36:30,397 --> 00:36:32,990
You've always been
gifted in both

235
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:35,510
Iiterature and martial arts.

236
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:38,684
The problem is you, Do-young.

237
00:36:39,325 --> 00:36:41,917
Literature or martial arts...

238
00:36:41,917 --> 00:36:45,277
You must make much effort
to catch up to Hun-myung.

239
00:36:45,277 --> 00:36:46,782
You embarrass me, sir.

240
00:36:46,782 --> 00:36:48,440
Yes, Father.

241
00:36:49,181 --> 00:36:50,909
Of course you're right.

242
00:36:50,909 --> 00:36:53,309
I shall try to do my best.

243
00:36:53,309 --> 00:36:57,053
But no matter how hard I try,

244
00:36:57,053 --> 00:36:58,973
I won't be able to
catch up to him.

245
00:36:58,973 --> 00:37:05,597
He is a few years older and
born with natural talents.

246
00:37:05,597 --> 00:37:09,656
Plus, he has a bad temper
not to lose to anyone.

247
00:37:10,493 --> 00:37:15,005
No matter what I do,
how can I be as good as he?

248
00:37:15,005 --> 00:37:19,894
So please, don't have
such high expectations on me.

249
00:37:38,878 --> 00:37:41,595
You say we're only
3 days away from Joseon?

250
00:37:43,389 --> 00:37:44,567
Yes, sir.

251
00:37:47,229 --> 00:37:48,861
But it'll be hard
in this weather?

252
00:37:48,861 --> 00:37:50,771
Yes... I reckon, sir.

253
00:37:54,301 --> 00:37:56,243
I remembered
where I saw you.

254
00:38:13,053 --> 00:38:16,119
You ran away
before the battle ended.

255
00:38:16,957 --> 00:38:17,906
Didn't you?

256
00:38:21,277 --> 00:38:22,171
That hand...

257
00:38:23,197 --> 00:38:24,920
How should I take that?

258
00:38:25,373 --> 00:38:26,267
Sir?

259
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:32,691
Do you dare?

260
00:38:52,765 --> 00:38:53,692
I'm sorry, sir!

261
00:38:55,133 --> 00:38:56,562
Please forgive me!

262
00:38:57,021 --> 00:38:59,356
Please, General!

263
00:39:00,189 --> 00:39:01,725
I was wrong!

264
00:39:01,725 --> 00:39:05,469
Please forgive me, sir!

265
00:39:05,469 --> 00:39:07,030
I know what you're
worried about.

266
00:39:08,189 --> 00:39:11,538
But don't worry.
That won't happen.

267
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:15,741
Really, sir?

268
00:39:15,741 --> 00:39:17,650
We already lost the battle.

269
00:39:19,005 --> 00:39:20,761
Now, we must try to survive.

270
00:39:22,269 --> 00:39:23,163
Thank you!

271
00:39:23,805 --> 00:39:26,973
Thank you, General!

272
00:39:26,973 --> 00:39:28,020
Thank you!

273
00:39:29,053 --> 00:39:32,510
Thank you, sir!

274
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:33,971
Damn bastards.

275
00:39:42,781 --> 00:39:47,418
Our dispatch rider isn't
lying dead here, is he?

276
00:39:49,405 --> 00:39:50,485
I'm sorry.

277
00:39:51,741 --> 00:39:55,453
Perhaps he got lost
in the fierce snowstorm.

278
00:39:55,453 --> 00:39:58,519
Maybe he's stuck somewhere?

279
00:39:59,293 --> 00:40:00,634
Let's hope so.

280
00:40:01,181 --> 00:40:06,077
There's a tavern a day away

281
00:40:06,077 --> 00:40:07,735
from here
by the Joseon border.

282
00:40:08,093 --> 00:40:09,948
Shall we go there and look?

283
00:40:29,597 --> 00:40:31,325
T omorrow...

284
00:40:31,325 --> 00:40:32,754
We leave at the crack of dawn.

285
00:40:37,245 --> 00:40:40,147
In weather like this?
What's the rush?

286
00:40:41,501 --> 00:40:45,309
Sir? I reckon it'll be hard
in this weather.

287
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:46,968
I tried to go...

288
00:40:47,709 --> 00:40:48,958
Not that I tried to leave.

289
00:40:48,958 --> 00:40:53,181
Anyway, we could go
and freeze to death, sir.

290
00:40:53,181 --> 00:40:58,778
If we stay, we'll eventually
starve or freeze to death.

291
00:41:01,757 --> 00:41:04,026
You said
we're days from Joseon.

292
00:41:06,013 --> 00:41:08,893
We'll take the remaining
food and firewood.

293
00:41:08,893 --> 00:41:12,755
No matter how rough,
we should make it in 5 days.

294
00:41:13,405 --> 00:41:15,229
But still...

295
00:41:15,229 --> 00:41:16,212
Make the preparations.

296
00:41:17,437 --> 00:41:18,331
Yes, sir.

297
00:41:26,557 --> 00:41:29,371
That makes things difficult.

298
00:41:33,853 --> 00:41:34,714
Why?

299
00:41:36,445 --> 00:41:39,129
What do you mean, why?

300
00:41:41,117 --> 00:41:43,637
I told you.
If we stayed here...

301
00:41:49,277 --> 00:41:51,612
You asked me to kill you...

302
00:41:52,925 --> 00:41:54,779
But now you want to live?

303
00:41:55,901 --> 00:41:56,883
What...

304
00:41:58,589 --> 00:42:00,018
do you mean?

305
00:42:00,797 --> 00:42:05,501
How long are you going to pretend
you don't know?

306
00:42:05,501 --> 00:42:09,331
Isn't that why
you're in a rush to go?

307
00:42:15,261 --> 00:42:19,516
You think I should've died
in the snow field.

308
00:42:20,541 --> 00:42:21,818
It was me.

309
00:42:24,669 --> 00:42:25,563
Don't you?

310
00:42:29,949 --> 00:42:31,005
You...

311
00:42:31,005 --> 00:42:33,526
That's right.
I heard everything.

312
00:42:36,477 --> 00:42:38,233
Thanks to that, I survived.

313
00:42:39,069 --> 00:42:40,978
It woke me right up.

314
00:42:41,821 --> 00:42:45,181
How could I die
with the traitor

315
00:42:45,181 --> 00:42:47,123
I've been looking for
right here?

316
00:42:48,157 --> 00:42:49,050
Well...

317
00:42:50,557 --> 00:42:52,285
Since I'm like this,

318
00:42:52,285 --> 00:42:54,620
I pretended not to hear and
waited for the chance...

319
00:42:56,413 --> 00:42:58,621
But since you
insist on leaving,

320
00:42:58,621 --> 00:43:00,082
you leave me with no choice.

321
00:43:07,005 --> 00:43:08,728
Damn fool.

322
00:43:09,181 --> 00:43:10,610
How can you eat that?

323
00:43:11,581 --> 00:43:15,965
Though you're a simpleton
without much learning,

324
00:43:15,965 --> 00:43:20,602
think with that
big head of yours!

325
00:43:23,485 --> 00:43:25,973
Do you know
what kind of man he is?

326
00:43:28,093 --> 00:43:30,100
You think he'd let you live?

327
00:43:31,901 --> 00:43:34,323
We escaped from the battlefield.

328
00:43:35,069 --> 00:43:42,269
That fool would sacrifice anything
for power and riches.

329
00:43:42,269 --> 00:43:43,196
Look, Do-young.

330
00:43:45,437 --> 00:43:48,503
He'll frame you with something

331
00:43:49,437 --> 00:43:53,469
and say he had to chase you out.

332
00:43:53,469 --> 00:43:58,077
Framing you is nothing to him.

333
00:43:58,077 --> 00:43:59,638
That's what I'd do.

334
00:44:01,149 --> 00:44:03,288
What do you think?

335
00:44:07,324 --> 00:44:08,731
I guess my hunch was right.

336
00:44:09,693 --> 00:44:10,587
Wasn't it?

337
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:13,755
Why? You want to kill me?

338
00:44:14,973 --> 00:44:21,372
Oh, right. Of course you will.

339
00:44:21,372 --> 00:44:26,107
Since he says he knows the way,
you won't be needing me.

340
00:44:29,245 --> 00:44:31,357
If you knew,

341
00:44:31,357 --> 00:44:34,333
you would've left me
out there to die.

342
00:44:34,333 --> 00:44:36,472
You must really regret it.

343
00:44:38,173 --> 00:44:39,067
Don't you?

344
00:44:39,997 --> 00:44:41,371
That's enough.

345
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:45,469
Let's talk about that
when we get back to Joseon.

346
00:44:45,469 --> 00:44:47,197
Joseon?

347
00:44:47,197 --> 00:44:49,400
You really think you can
make it back alive?

348
00:44:55,421 --> 00:44:57,276
You worthless dog!

349
00:44:58,685 --> 00:44:59,961
You repay mercy with betrayal?

350
00:45:16,733 --> 00:45:20,093
Though you passed
the court examination,

351
00:45:20,093 --> 00:45:26,300
people still look negatively on
you and your family.

352
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:30,909
Though it is a low ranked position
in the country,

353
00:45:30,909 --> 00:45:34,077
I struggled to even get you that.

354
00:45:34,077 --> 00:45:36,189
Go down and come back
after a few years.

355
00:45:36,189 --> 00:45:39,866
But, sir!
I passed the examination!

356
00:45:40,604 --> 00:45:45,241
How can you send me
to a position like that?

357
00:45:49,244 --> 00:45:55,474
I've backed away from things
I should have as you wished.

358
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:58,358
But not this time, sir.

359
00:45:58,717 --> 00:46:00,178
Not this time?

360
00:46:00,733 --> 00:46:05,245
Then what will you do?
You have no choice.

361
00:46:05,245 --> 00:46:06,139
Sir!

362
00:46:09,756 --> 00:46:11,197
Hun-myung...

363
00:46:11,197 --> 00:46:13,336
This is a request.
Do as I say.

364
00:46:14,269 --> 00:46:16,887
A request?
What do you mean?

365
00:46:18,429 --> 00:46:21,181
If you cared for Do-young,

366
00:46:21,181 --> 00:46:24,377
I hope you'll do this
for his future.

367
00:46:24,925 --> 00:46:26,299
Actually...

368
00:46:27,517 --> 00:46:29,906
our So-beuk Clan
has not been happy

369
00:46:30,557 --> 00:46:34,301
with you two being close.

370
00:46:34,301 --> 00:46:36,919
It's always been a burden
on me, too.

371
00:46:37,852 --> 00:46:39,227
You and Do-young...

372
00:46:40,349 --> 00:46:43,037
I mean, your family and ours...

373
00:46:43,037 --> 00:46:46,517
we're in opposing parties.
We're different.

374
00:46:47,741 --> 00:46:49,399
May I ask one thing, sir?

375
00:46:52,348 --> 00:46:53,625
Is Do-young...

376
00:46:55,517 --> 00:46:56,891
aware of this, too?

377
00:47:20,925 --> 00:47:23,827
Why do you look
so happy, my friend?

378
00:47:25,244 --> 00:47:27,933
You brought me out here,
Tell me.

379
00:47:27,933 --> 00:47:29,787
Nothing gets by you.

380
00:47:31,293 --> 00:47:33,757
Of course.

381
00:47:33,757 --> 00:47:35,895
I survived this long
on my intuitions.

382
00:47:38,365 --> 00:47:40,405
I...

383
00:47:41,629 --> 00:47:43,287
Ianded a position in court.

384
00:47:46,141 --> 00:47:50,876
But you didn't even
take the examination.

385
00:47:52,476 --> 00:47:53,917
Special appointment?

386
00:47:53,917 --> 00:47:56,125
Did your father arrange it?

387
00:47:56,125 --> 00:47:57,693
Yes, I guess.

388
00:47:57,693 --> 00:48:02,166
It's not like I want my father
to pull special favors for me.

389
00:48:04,477 --> 00:48:08,306
If only I was gifted in literature
and martial arts like you...

390
00:48:09,533 --> 00:48:10,711
Please.

391
00:48:11,453 --> 00:48:17,432
That reminds me.
What about your test results?

392
00:48:29,116 --> 00:48:33,426
Not good? I'm so sorry.

393
00:48:34,204 --> 00:48:38,204
And I go on about getting in
on special appointment.

394
00:48:38,204 --> 00:48:40,725
Anyway, I'm embarrassed.

395
00:48:44,445 --> 00:48:46,652
By the way...

396
00:48:46,652 --> 00:48:49,053
There is another
embarrassing matter.

397
00:48:49,053 --> 00:48:50,035
What is it this time?

398
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:58,482
I'm arranged to be married.

399
00:49:05,277 --> 00:49:06,804
At last...

400
00:49:08,157 --> 00:49:10,743
you will marry Seo-hyun?

401
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:16,285
<i><font color=yellow>Subtitle by</i></font>
<b><font color=Red>Aldi Arman</b></font>

402
00:49:17,245 --> 00:49:19,069
Then you...

403
00:49:19,069 --> 00:49:22,716
the soon to be son-in-law
of the governor,

404
00:49:22,716 --> 00:49:25,885
are grumbling to me
who is an aristocrat in name only?

405
00:49:25,885 --> 00:49:29,846
No, of course not.
Why would l?

406
00:49:31,837 --> 00:49:35,869
I'm sorry.
How impertinent of me.

407
00:49:35,869 --> 00:49:37,625
To say that in front of you.

408
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:41,144
Treating me
to this table won't do.

409
00:49:42,653 --> 00:49:44,669
Let's drink all night, shall we?

410
00:49:44,669 --> 00:49:45,562
Why sure!

411
00:49:51,197 --> 00:49:54,269
I knew her since she was young.

412
00:49:54,269 --> 00:49:56,505
I didn't have feelings for her.

413
00:49:58,588 --> 00:50:00,701
But now...

414
00:50:00,701 --> 00:50:03,035
I see she's grown
into a woman.

415
00:50:05,533 --> 00:50:08,315
Hun-myung?
What do you think?

416
00:50:09,052 --> 00:50:09,946
Well...

417
00:50:12,028 --> 00:50:14,614
Oh, now I remember you...

418
00:50:16,988 --> 00:50:18,646
Me? What?

419
00:50:19,293 --> 00:50:22,293
Didn't you like Seo-hyun
since you were little?

420
00:50:23,421 --> 00:50:26,235
What are you saying?
I did not.

421
00:50:26,588 --> 00:50:28,530
Please... I was sure you did.

422
00:50:30,141 --> 00:50:33,021
Nonsense! I never!

423
00:50:33,021 --> 00:50:34,941
Don't get so excited.

424
00:50:34,941 --> 00:50:35,834
I'm joking.

425
00:50:43,293 --> 00:50:44,340
So silly.

426
00:51:45,629 --> 00:51:47,932
I know what you are thinking.

427
00:51:47,932 --> 00:51:49,181
Sir?

428
00:51:49,181 --> 00:51:52,509
You want to kill me
and that fool.

429
00:51:52,509 --> 00:51:54,429
Only then,
will you be rest assured.

430
00:51:54,429 --> 00:51:57,243
No, sir! How dare l...

431
00:51:59,804 --> 00:52:03,644
If you want to live,
it's unavoidable, isn't it?

432
00:52:03,644 --> 00:52:08,060
Your only way to survive
is by killing him first.

433
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:12,956
Then, you'll have to kill me, too.

434
00:52:12,956 --> 00:52:14,685
Am l...

435
00:52:14,685 --> 00:52:15,578
wrong?

436
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:26,076
Well, I already gave up on life.

437
00:52:26,076 --> 00:52:27,636
It doesn't matter.

438
00:52:30,109 --> 00:52:31,003
But...

439
00:52:32,412 --> 00:52:33,590
LEE Hun-myung...

440
00:52:34,909 --> 00:52:37,811
I must kill him
with my own hands.

441
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:43,260
Do you know what I am saying?

442
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:46,162
He's set on leaving tomorrow.
So we must kill him tonight.

443
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:50,777
You and I can't beat him alone
the way we are now.

444
00:52:51,517 --> 00:52:52,410
So...

445
00:53:06,173 --> 00:53:09,148
Damn aristocrats
can't be trusted.

446
00:53:09,148 --> 00:53:10,042
Just in case.

447
00:54:04,092 --> 00:54:07,261
Treading out
in this snowstorm...

448
00:54:07,261 --> 00:54:09,372
probably will be hard, right?

449
00:54:09,372 --> 00:54:13,021
Yes, sir.
It's hard, but...

450
00:54:13,021 --> 00:54:14,963
it'll be more dangerous.

451
00:54:17,821 --> 00:54:22,839
You think we can take
someone with a bad leg with us?

452
00:54:26,396 --> 00:54:28,600
- Do you have any family?
- Sir?

453
00:54:28,956 --> 00:54:30,396
How many children do you have?

454
00:54:30,396 --> 00:54:32,700
Four, sir.

455
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:35,164
Three boys and a girl.

456
00:54:35,164 --> 00:54:39,953
Then, I guess you'll want to
make it back alive to see them.

457
00:54:42,077 --> 00:54:43,353
If we make it back...

458
00:54:45,724 --> 00:54:47,960
I shall owe you my life.

459
00:54:48,701 --> 00:54:50,555
I promise I'll repay you.

460
00:54:51,964 --> 00:54:55,063
Yes, sir!

461
00:55:04,444 --> 00:55:06,070
Damn, stupid bastards.

462
00:55:09,596 --> 00:55:10,873
Shit.

463
00:55:41,245 --> 00:55:43,452
My master is not pleased.

464
00:55:43,452 --> 00:55:44,796
What? Why...

465
00:55:44,796 --> 00:55:48,732
As the county head,
there's a lot to spend money on.

466
00:55:48,732 --> 00:55:50,968
But not enough money coming in.

467
00:55:53,564 --> 00:55:56,248
I wonder where
we can get more money.

468
00:55:57,469 --> 00:55:59,676
I should raise the taxes.

469
00:55:59,676 --> 00:56:02,065
But, sir! No! Please!

470
00:56:03,516 --> 00:56:04,694
No complaints.

471
00:56:27,484 --> 00:56:29,044
Are we prepared
to leave tomorrow?

472
00:56:29,501 --> 00:56:30,875
Yes, sir.

473
00:56:33,084 --> 00:56:35,451
We'll be leaving early.
Get some sleep.

474
00:56:35,932 --> 00:56:36,880
So...

475
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:40,444
Have you decided
what you'll do with me?

476
00:56:40,444 --> 00:56:42,652
Will you kill me?

477
00:56:42,652 --> 00:56:45,619
Or just leave me to die?

478
00:56:49,532 --> 00:56:51,932
Since you're not
quick to answer,

479
00:56:51,932 --> 00:56:53,209
I guess
you're set on killing me.

480
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:17,754
Where are you going?

481
00:57:20,796 --> 00:57:21,778
I have to go pee, sir.

482
00:57:33,596 --> 00:57:36,182
Stupid, wretched fools.

483
00:57:36,924 --> 00:57:41,147
That's why they work to the bone
and complain all their lives.

484
00:57:42,492 --> 00:57:47,100
He's supposed
to kill you with me.

485
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:51,484
There probably won't be
a chance after tonight.

486
00:57:51,484 --> 00:57:52,636
Look, Do-young.

487
00:57:52,636 --> 00:57:54,294
Oh, right.

488
00:57:55,420 --> 00:58:00,635
Did you wheedle that simpleton
into killing me, too?

489
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:03,799
Of course you did.

490
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:07,036
You're more than capable
of something like that.

491
00:58:07,036 --> 00:58:07,930
JANG Do-young!

492
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:11,250
Must you end it like this?

493
00:58:12,988 --> 00:58:14,514
Now you show your true nature.

494
00:58:30,524 --> 00:58:32,252
Must it come to this?

495
00:58:32,252 --> 00:58:33,884
Why?

496
00:58:33,884 --> 00:58:36,786
You expected me to just die?

497
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:42,524
Really, you have no dignity.

498
00:58:42,524 --> 00:58:44,182
You killed my father...

499
00:58:45,404 --> 00:58:47,900
And now you try to kill me.

500
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:49,329
I'm sorry.
But that's not happening.

501
00:58:50,588 --> 00:58:53,849
I'll kill you first!

502
00:59:06,204 --> 00:59:07,548
Fine.

503
00:59:07,548 --> 00:59:09,468
If that's what you want,
I'll fight you!

504
00:59:09,468 --> 00:59:10,548
Go to hell!

505
00:59:36,252 --> 00:59:39,483
They're finely cut
pieces of glass!

506
00:59:39,483 --> 00:59:41,239
I reckon it'll be hard to see!

507
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:07,322
I told you,
That bastard's life is mine!

508
01:00:12,764 --> 01:00:13,820
Son of a bitch!

509
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:15,740
Who cares who kills him?

510
01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:19,388
You're good
for a man who can't see!

511
01:00:19,388 --> 01:00:21,116
You lowlife vulgar!

512
01:00:21,116 --> 01:00:22,844
Think you can get away
with this?

513
01:00:22,844 --> 01:00:26,193
This lowlife vulgar
must do this to survive!

514
01:00:31,548 --> 01:00:34,265
You're dead anyways.
Go quietly!

515
01:00:35,771 --> 01:00:38,748
Give it up!

516
01:00:38,748 --> 01:00:40,407
I warned you! He's mine!

517
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:46,641
You son of a bitch!

518
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:15,676
Do-young! Do-young!

519
01:01:15,676 --> 01:01:17,116
Must you do this?

520
01:01:17,116 --> 01:01:19,708
What would you do
if you were me?

521
01:01:19,708 --> 01:01:21,050
You gave me no choice!

522
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:44,572
Sir! Wait!

523
01:02:44,572 --> 01:02:45,465
Wait!

524
01:02:45,820 --> 01:02:47,740
Why are you doing this?

525
01:02:47,740 --> 01:02:50,620
You didn't pay
your army tax for this month.

526
01:02:50,620 --> 01:02:51,700
So you should go instead!

527
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:54,556
But I already paid!

528
01:02:54,556 --> 01:02:56,596
Check the ledger, sir!
I paid!

529
01:02:57,243 --> 01:02:58,137
- The ledger?
- Yes!

530
01:02:58,971 --> 01:03:00,027
Well...

531
01:03:00,027 --> 01:03:03,027
I don't know who you paid to...

532
01:03:04,348 --> 01:03:07,544
But your name's not
in my ledger!

533
01:03:08,571 --> 01:03:09,531
Get him!

534
01:03:09,531 --> 01:03:12,880
Sir! Why are you doing this?

535
01:03:13,436 --> 01:03:18,044
I offered up enough
to you officers, didn't l?

536
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:20,924
Then why are you doing this?

537
01:03:20,924 --> 01:03:23,708
When did you ever
give me anything?

538
01:03:23,708 --> 01:03:27,259
You always gave it
to other fools!

539
01:03:27,259 --> 01:03:31,700
You should've paid me
long before.

540
01:03:32,636 --> 01:03:33,596
- Take him.
- Sir!

541
01:03:33,596 --> 01:03:35,132
You're too late.

542
01:03:35,132 --> 01:03:37,916
You're already on the list
to go to war.

543
01:03:37,916 --> 01:03:38,876
Take him away.

544
01:03:38,876 --> 01:03:40,699
Sir! Please!

545
01:03:40,699 --> 01:03:42,804
I beg you! Please!

546
01:03:44,604 --> 01:03:46,140
Daddy!

547
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:48,539
Don't worry!

548
01:03:48,539 --> 01:03:52,379
It's not the first time!
I'll be right back!

549
01:03:52,379 --> 01:03:53,339
No!

550
01:03:53,339 --> 01:03:54,233
Go on in!

551
01:03:57,948 --> 01:03:59,772
Daddy!

552
01:03:59,772 --> 01:04:01,910
Go on!

553
01:04:48,507 --> 01:04:51,191
Going to this war

554
01:04:52,124 --> 01:04:55,419
is just to build
better relations with Ming.

555
01:04:56,347 --> 01:05:01,465
What can a handful of
Joseon soldiers do?

556
01:05:02,876 --> 01:05:09,040
Just stand behind the Ming army
and pull out later.

557
01:05:09,979 --> 01:05:16,603
If you distinguished yourself
in the battle, it would be nice.

558
01:05:16,603 --> 01:05:23,226
War is a great opportunity for
a man from a weak background.

559
01:05:24,252 --> 01:05:27,066
Yes, sir.
I'm very well aware.

560
01:05:27,419 --> 01:05:30,234
Anyway, come back alive.

561
01:05:31,451 --> 01:05:34,139
When you return from the war,

562
01:05:34,139 --> 01:05:39,158
I'll make a position for you
in the court.

563
01:05:56,860 --> 01:05:57,754
Sir?

564
01:06:04,443 --> 01:06:05,425
What?

565
01:06:06,556 --> 01:06:09,147
Do you have
something else to say?

566
01:06:09,147 --> 01:06:11,548
I have another favor
to ask, sir.

567
01:06:11,548 --> 01:06:14,140
What is it?

568
01:06:14,140 --> 01:06:19,996
The former governor's daughter,
Seo-hyun, has become a slave.

569
01:06:19,996 --> 01:06:22,811
I know. So?

570
01:06:24,892 --> 01:06:25,840
Well...

571
01:06:27,356 --> 01:06:31,032
You want me to give her to you?

572
01:06:34,940 --> 01:06:37,754
Fine. As you wish.

573
01:06:39,644 --> 01:06:41,179
Thank you, sir.

574
01:06:41,179 --> 01:06:42,073
No need.

575
01:06:42,524 --> 01:06:48,121
Anything for a man who gave up
everything to be on our side.

576
01:06:55,387 --> 01:06:56,281
But...

577
01:06:58,076 --> 01:07:00,060
Isn't that girl...

578
01:07:00,060 --> 01:07:03,442
the one arranged
to marry JANG Do-young?

579
01:07:13,787 --> 01:07:15,730
The wind is quite chilly.

580
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:32,787
Why? Angry?

581
01:07:34,299 --> 01:07:35,193
Regretful?

582
01:07:36,796 --> 01:07:38,716
Of course.

583
01:07:38,716 --> 01:07:43,516
Fortune awaits
if you make it back to Joseon.

584
01:07:43,516 --> 01:07:47,378
You must feel angry
it has to be this way.

585
01:07:51,867 --> 01:07:53,045
Filthy bastard.

586
01:08:38,844 --> 01:08:40,120
Ching soldiers!

587
01:08:42,395 --> 01:08:43,548
They're here!

588
01:08:43,548 --> 01:08:45,108
We must hide somewhere!

589
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:50,776
Let's go down there, sir!

590
01:08:52,859 --> 01:08:53,753
This way, sir!

591
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:04,848
Grab the handle.

592
01:09:05,531 --> 01:09:06,905
The handle, sir!

593
01:09:07,836 --> 01:09:10,705
Pull up.

594
01:09:12,987 --> 01:09:14,139
What are you doing?

595
01:09:14,139 --> 01:09:16,732
Hurry! Or we'll all get killed
by the Ching soldiers!

596
01:09:16,732 --> 01:09:19,350
Do-young! Hurry up!

597
01:09:21,051 --> 01:09:22,131
I don't believe this.

598
01:11:26,683 --> 01:11:27,452
Stop!

599
01:11:27,452 --> 01:11:30,070
If he escapes,
he'll return with more troops.

600
01:11:31,099 --> 01:11:32,375
Don't let him get away.

601
01:12:04,859 --> 01:12:05,841
What happened?

602
01:12:21,564 --> 01:12:22,807
Now, we're done for!

603
01:12:48,507 --> 01:12:49,401
Sir...

604
01:12:50,331 --> 01:12:53,048
We don't have time for this.

605
01:12:53,979 --> 01:12:55,986
They'll be coming around
any minute!

606
01:12:59,323 --> 01:13:00,217
Right, sir?

607
01:13:16,123 --> 01:13:17,105
Look, Do-young.

608
01:13:19,003 --> 01:13:22,451
Yes, I know.

609
01:13:24,283 --> 01:13:26,487
I don't have any interest
in being in the court.

610
01:13:26,971 --> 01:13:32,056
I should be happy just being alive
in the enemy clan's world.

611
01:13:40,667 --> 01:13:43,766
Why don't you take
the military examination?

612
01:13:44,411 --> 01:13:46,833
They won't care about that.

613
01:13:48,155 --> 01:13:49,049
Not interested.

614
01:13:49,979 --> 01:13:52,598
I'll just end up being
their dog.

615
01:13:53,915 --> 01:13:56,315
That all depends.

616
01:13:56,315 --> 01:13:59,576
You know how aristocrats with
no titles or assets live.

617
01:14:01,275 --> 01:14:02,933
Look at me.

618
01:14:06,555 --> 01:14:07,537
Take the examination.

619
01:14:08,859 --> 01:14:10,615
How could you...

620
01:14:13,947 --> 01:14:15,124
How...

621
01:14:19,611 --> 01:14:21,466
Then let's make a bet.

622
01:14:23,547 --> 01:14:28,053
If you last longer under water,
I'll do as you wish.

623
01:14:29,883 --> 01:14:33,232
This isn't summer.
It's cold.

624
01:14:36,283 --> 01:14:40,058
Don't take the examination then.

625
01:14:41,179 --> 01:14:43,219
Living like this
isn't that terrible.

626
01:14:44,251 --> 01:14:45,403
What?

627
01:14:45,403 --> 01:14:47,803
Such hasty personality.

628
01:14:47,803 --> 01:14:50,395
You change your mind
just due to cold water?

629
01:14:50,395 --> 01:14:52,603
Watch it! I'll fall!

630
01:14:52,603 --> 01:14:54,907
I want you to fall!

631
01:14:54,907 --> 01:14:56,184
Wait!

632
01:14:57,403 --> 01:14:58,450
Then let's go in together.

633
01:14:59,899 --> 01:15:00,946
We're friends, aren't we?

634
01:15:09,947 --> 01:15:11,703
How refreshing!

635
01:15:13,595 --> 01:15:14,969
So refreshing!

636
01:15:20,027 --> 01:15:21,205
How could you...

637
01:15:23,099 --> 01:15:23,993
Hun-myung!

638
01:15:47,067 --> 01:15:50,139
I have to live!

639
01:15:50,139 --> 01:15:54,171
I can't live mixed up with you
aristocrats back in Joseon.

640
01:15:54,171 --> 01:15:55,995
I'm sorry!

641
01:15:55,995 --> 01:15:57,556
Just die! Will you!

642
01:15:58,683 --> 01:15:59,762
Enough!

643
01:16:12,667 --> 01:16:14,129
I said, that's enough!

644
01:16:18,139 --> 01:16:19,195
Right!

645
01:16:19,195 --> 01:16:21,115
You wanted to take
his life, right?

646
01:16:21,115 --> 01:16:24,411
I almost lost
my wrist this time.

647
01:16:27,931 --> 01:16:29,011
He's all yours.

648
01:17:00,923 --> 01:17:03,131
For the last time...

649
01:17:03,131 --> 01:17:05,073
Let me ask you one thing.

650
01:17:07,291 --> 01:17:10,553
You'll die anyway.
So tell the truth.

651
01:17:11,579 --> 01:17:13,684
In order for you to live...

652
01:17:14,843 --> 01:17:16,850
did you have no other choice?

653
01:17:17,691 --> 01:17:21,368
You had to do it?

654
01:17:25,082 --> 01:17:26,064
Answer me.

655
01:17:26,811 --> 01:17:27,890
Answer me!

656
01:17:28,539 --> 01:17:30,099
Say it!

657
01:17:38,907 --> 01:17:42,267
Kill him already!

658
01:17:42,267 --> 01:17:44,121
Don't take all day!

659
01:17:45,915 --> 01:17:48,378
You ignorant fool!

660
01:17:48,378 --> 01:17:51,067
Stop meddling! You bastard!

661
01:17:51,067 --> 01:17:52,627
Just stay damn put!

662
01:17:54,811 --> 01:17:55,988
What did you say?

663
01:18:06,427 --> 01:18:08,183
You son of a bitch!

664
01:18:09,307 --> 01:18:12,984
Damn aristocrats!
I'll kill you both!

665
01:18:13,435 --> 01:18:15,508
You son of a bitch!

666
01:18:16,826 --> 01:18:21,083
He's practically dead.
So you don't need me, huh!

667
01:18:21,083 --> 01:18:22,643
You're done with using me!

668
01:18:23,771 --> 01:18:29,339
You know how I ended up
being dragged out here like this?

669
01:18:29,339 --> 01:18:32,634
It's all cuz of
damn aristocrats like you!

670
01:18:34,139 --> 01:18:35,699
You son of a bitch!

671
01:18:38,171 --> 01:18:41,367
Still, I thought
I'd let you kill him

672
01:18:41,659 --> 01:18:43,863
and kept patient!

673
01:18:44,507 --> 01:18:47,099
I'll have to
kill both of you anyways!

674
01:18:47,099 --> 01:18:52,183
It doesn't matter
who goes first! Does it?

675
01:18:56,186 --> 01:18:58,491
You just know how to use people!

676
01:18:58,491 --> 01:19:03,313
Damn aristocrats don't see
people like us as humans!

677
01:19:12,123 --> 01:19:14,715
Die already! Die!

678
01:19:14,715 --> 01:19:17,104
Damn annoying bastards!

679
01:19:23,547 --> 01:19:27,289
Die! Die!

680
01:19:59,194 --> 01:20:00,853
This can't be...

681
01:20:07,930 --> 01:20:10,548
This can't be happening...

682
01:20:31,035 --> 01:20:32,212
Gotcha!

683
01:20:33,435 --> 01:20:34,711
No.

684
01:20:36,890 --> 01:20:41,712
Oh no...

685
01:20:43,227 --> 01:20:48,628
Oh no...

686
01:21:13,818 --> 01:21:16,339
Gather around!

687
01:21:18,426 --> 01:21:19,320
Follow me!

688
01:23:25,402 --> 01:23:26,296
Do-young? Is that you?

689
01:23:31,739 --> 01:23:32,633
Look, Do-young.

690
01:23:33,178 --> 01:23:34,836
Must we really do this?

691
01:23:35,771 --> 01:23:38,459
I had no idea that would
happen to your father.

692
01:23:38,459 --> 01:23:41,626
If I did,
how could I have done it?

693
01:23:41,626 --> 01:23:45,750
Yes, I was promised a future
by turning in your father!

694
01:23:46,299 --> 01:23:48,507
I admit that! But!

695
01:23:48,507 --> 01:23:51,770
I didn't do it
just for my benefit!

696
01:23:51,770 --> 01:23:54,487
If it wasn't for me,
you would've ended up dead!

697
01:23:56,570 --> 01:24:01,370
They would've killed you
like your father!

698
01:24:01,370 --> 01:24:06,843
I actually ended up saving you!

699
01:24:06,843 --> 01:24:08,697
Shut your mouth! You bastard!

700
01:24:10,778 --> 01:24:11,727
Oh...

701
01:24:13,371 --> 01:24:15,094
There you are.

702
01:24:21,115 --> 01:24:22,577
Despicable bastard!

703
01:24:24,283 --> 01:24:28,057
You worthless brute!
Shut your damn mouth!

704
01:24:32,346 --> 01:24:35,803
After how my father
and I treated you,

705
01:24:35,803 --> 01:24:37,627
you repay mercy with betrayal!

706
01:24:37,627 --> 01:24:39,162
You call yourself a man!

707
01:24:39,162 --> 01:24:40,820
Your father is already gone.

708
01:24:43,387 --> 01:24:46,842
Killing me now
won't change that.

709
01:24:46,842 --> 01:24:50,363
Let's just go back
to Joseon together.

710
01:24:50,363 --> 01:24:52,305
I'm set to get
a court position.

711
01:24:55,067 --> 01:24:57,107
I'll make a spot for you, too.

712
01:24:58,330 --> 01:24:59,508
How about it?

713
01:25:03,899 --> 01:25:05,459
After my father died...

714
01:25:07,579 --> 01:25:10,840
my mother went mad from shock
and hung herself.

715
01:25:15,610 --> 01:25:16,658
If you were me...

716
01:25:17,626 --> 01:25:18,870
can you forgive?

717
01:25:24,219 --> 01:25:27,121
Yes, it won't be easy.

718
01:25:28,826 --> 01:25:30,103
You're right.

719
01:25:30,875 --> 01:25:32,784
Of course you can't forgive.

720
01:25:41,818 --> 01:25:45,818
But still,
I wanted to spare you.

721
01:25:45,818 --> 01:25:47,728
That's why I let you live
all this time.

722
01:25:48,890 --> 01:25:50,264
But I guess
it has to end this way.

723
01:25:51,386 --> 01:25:54,354
Yes! So say it!

724
01:25:55,770 --> 01:25:58,171
Confess everything!

725
01:25:58,171 --> 01:26:00,505
Fine. I'll tell you.

726
01:26:01,595 --> 01:26:05,107
You should know the truth
before you die!

727
01:26:05,755 --> 01:26:06,737
Yes, I did it!

728
01:26:08,635 --> 01:26:12,497
I went to them on my own
and denounced your father!

729
01:26:12,954 --> 01:26:17,297
He's the one who informed us of
So-beuk Clan's plans for treas on.

730
01:26:18,331 --> 01:26:19,279
I did it!

731
01:26:20,155 --> 01:26:22,391
Tell the leader.

732
01:26:24,187 --> 01:26:28,115
But promise me one thing, sir.

733
01:26:30,203 --> 01:26:32,821
This involves betraying
a man who is like a father to me.

734
01:26:33,370 --> 01:26:37,402
Thus, I deserve as much
in exchange.

735
01:26:37,402 --> 01:26:40,859
I told you not to worry
about your future.

736
01:26:40,859 --> 01:26:44,026
I'd like the party leader's
promise, sir!

737
01:26:44,026 --> 01:26:45,881
- Why you!
- Enough!

738
01:26:48,154 --> 01:26:50,674
Fine. I promise you.

739
01:26:51,419 --> 01:26:53,906
Then, let's hear it.

740
01:26:54,874 --> 01:26:56,979
What is it that you want?

741
01:27:02,235 --> 01:27:03,217
Why?

742
01:27:04,538 --> 01:27:05,432
Why did you do it?

743
01:27:07,322 --> 01:27:07,995
Why, you ask?

744
01:27:07,995 --> 01:27:11,642
Why did you repay mercy
with betrayal?

745
01:27:11,642 --> 01:27:12,986
For what?

746
01:27:12,986 --> 01:27:17,045
What? Mercy?

747
01:27:18,842 --> 01:27:23,065
Your father treated me
like a son,

748
01:27:27,099 --> 01:27:28,146
Then how...

749
01:27:29,242 --> 01:27:31,217
If he thought of me as his son!

750
01:27:31,899 --> 01:27:34,362
knowing how
I struggled through life!

751
01:27:34,362 --> 01:27:39,835
How can he give my court position
to you and send me to the country?

752
01:27:39,835 --> 01:27:42,256
How can he do that to me?

753
01:27:45,114 --> 01:27:49,242
You call that a reason?

754
01:27:49,242 --> 01:27:54,163
Even if it wasn't for me,
you can't land a court position.

755
01:27:54,906 --> 01:27:55,962
What?

756
01:27:55,962 --> 01:27:58,101
You worthless brute!

757
01:27:58,650 --> 01:28:02,458
We took you in,
clothed you, and fed you.

758
01:28:02,458 --> 01:28:03,441
How dare you!

759
01:28:03,931 --> 01:28:07,738
A lowlife always acting proud
because you can swing a sword!

760
01:28:07,738 --> 01:28:11,578
I should've seen how
vulgar and foul you really are.

761
01:28:11,578 --> 01:28:13,433
If you had the chance,

762
01:28:15,066 --> 01:28:18,230
you'd sell off anyone
to get what you want.

763
01:28:18,874 --> 01:28:21,689
But, that's it?

764
01:28:22,138 --> 01:28:23,993
Betraying your friend...

765
01:28:26,170 --> 01:28:28,090
selling off my father...

766
01:28:28,090 --> 01:28:30,778
and the opportunity
you gained...

767
01:28:30,778 --> 01:28:32,314
was coming to fight in

768
01:28:32,314 --> 01:28:34,038
a foreign land
to die like a dog!

769
01:28:37,850 --> 01:28:39,410
It serves you right.

770
01:28:40,059 --> 01:28:41,433
What do you know?

771
01:28:49,659 --> 01:28:51,219
How can you say that?

772
01:28:52,922 --> 01:28:55,061
What? It's the truth!

773
01:28:55,515 --> 01:28:59,093
You don't know your place

774
01:28:59,546 --> 01:29:02,645
and got used by
the Dae-beuk Clan!

775
01:29:03,099 --> 01:29:03,992
What?

776
01:29:04,538 --> 01:29:10,102
They told me to get rid of you!

777
01:29:11,706 --> 01:29:12,666
What?

778
01:29:12,666 --> 01:29:16,441
You think I didn't know?

779
01:29:16,922 --> 01:29:18,744
Why did you want to see me?

780
01:29:24,506 --> 01:29:36,563
His Majesty ordered to restore the
So-beuk Clan and reinvestigate.

781
01:29:37,242 --> 01:29:43,385
He reinstated
their positions in the court.

782
01:29:44,506 --> 01:29:47,674
So what?
You want to make peace?

783
01:29:47,674 --> 01:29:48,754
After everything?

784
01:29:52,570 --> 01:29:53,944
That's politics.

785
01:29:55,450 --> 01:29:58,930
Do anything to get what you need.

786
01:30:02,267 --> 01:30:04,656
The same members can
fight for blood,

787
01:30:06,010 --> 01:30:09,938
and gladly hold hands
with the enemy.

788
01:30:11,194 --> 01:30:13,946
That is what politics is about.

789
01:30:13,946 --> 01:30:18,583
You sirs can do damn politics
all you want.

790
01:30:18,939 --> 01:30:23,834
We didn't fight
like market thugs.

791
01:30:23,834 --> 01:30:25,689
We battled over power of the state.

792
01:30:26,138 --> 01:30:32,696
If your father had the power,
I'd be the one dead.

793
01:30:33,434 --> 01:30:37,562
It's just politics.
Nothing we can do.

794
01:30:37,562 --> 01:30:39,194
So, what are you saying?

795
01:30:39,194 --> 01:30:40,721
What do you want from me?

796
01:30:41,882 --> 01:30:43,126
It's a gift.

797
01:30:45,530 --> 01:30:50,036
I heard you're looking
for the one who betrayed you?

798
01:30:50,970 --> 01:30:56,666
Everything involved in the case
is recorded there.

799
01:30:57,210 --> 01:31:00,505
It says who informed us,

800
01:31:00,954 --> 01:31:04,434
and how this all started.

801
01:31:22,330 --> 01:31:24,948
I'll restore everything for you.

802
01:31:25,882 --> 01:31:28,784
Get revenge for your father...

803
01:31:29,818 --> 01:31:33,877
and let's forget the past.

804
01:31:39,226 --> 01:31:40,982
You knew everything?

805
01:31:42,298 --> 01:31:43,346
Then why...

806
01:31:44,122 --> 01:31:45,551
I didn't believe it.

807
01:31:47,674 --> 01:31:50,714
I couldn't believe it was you.

808
01:31:50,714 --> 01:31:54,391
I thought the Dae-beuk Clan
was up to their tricks again.

809
01:31:54,938 --> 01:31:58,713
I wanted...

810
01:32:00,410 --> 01:32:02,166
to trust you till the end.

811
01:32:03,098 --> 01:32:11,478
But you show your true,
despicable nature in the end.

812
01:32:16,250 --> 01:32:18,746
That damn rat!

813
01:32:18,746 --> 01:32:19,990
Do you get it now?

814
01:32:21,914 --> 01:32:24,762
In the Ching's hands or mine...

815
01:32:24,762 --> 01:32:26,970
you were sent here to die!

816
01:32:26,970 --> 01:32:30,451
Shut up! I'm not dying!

817
01:32:33,818 --> 01:32:37,462
Damn bastards!
I'll kill them all!

818
01:32:37,914 --> 01:32:40,434
I'll kill every one of them!

819
01:32:41,466 --> 01:32:45,114
Starting with you and that rat,

820
01:32:45,114 --> 01:32:47,994
I'll kill them all!

821
01:32:47,994 --> 01:32:50,329
You still don't get it!

822
01:32:52,442 --> 01:32:58,835
They're not people you can face
with just your sword!

823
01:33:07,866 --> 01:33:12,250
Do-young!
You dare mock me till the end!

824
01:33:12,250 --> 01:33:14,006
You son of a bitch!

825
01:33:15,130 --> 01:33:19,162
This all started
because of you!

826
01:33:19,162 --> 01:33:22,906
If it wasn't for you,
if you didn't mock me so,

827
01:33:22,906 --> 01:33:25,594
if your father
didn't do that to me,

828
01:33:25,594 --> 01:33:27,770
none of this would've happened!

829
01:33:27,770 --> 01:33:30,868
You bastards made me this way!

830
01:33:31,610 --> 01:33:35,066
You're 3 years younger
but never showed respect!

831
01:33:35,066 --> 01:33:37,561
Being older
doesn't give you the right!

832
01:33:37,561 --> 01:33:39,098
Why you!

833
01:33:39,098 --> 01:33:39,992
Shit!

834
01:34:16,314 --> 01:34:17,208
Come here!

835
01:34:17,946 --> 01:34:19,222
Where are you hiding?

836
01:34:20,538 --> 01:34:24,499
Come out! You bastard!

837
01:34:26,298 --> 01:34:28,986
I don't have time for this!

838
01:34:28,986 --> 01:34:30,969
To go back to Joseon

839
01:34:30,969 --> 01:34:33,686
and kill
the Dae-beuk Clan bastards...

840
01:34:34,138 --> 01:34:36,472
you'll have to die first!

841
01:34:37,114 --> 01:34:40,409
Come out here, now!

842
01:34:40,890 --> 01:34:43,857
Do-young! Come out!

843
01:34:49,306 --> 01:34:50,386
JANG Do-young

844
01:34:52,858 --> 01:34:54,134
You're there.

845
01:34:55,450 --> 01:34:56,344
Aren't you?

846
01:35:01,689 --> 01:35:02,834
I know.

847
01:35:04,538 --> 01:35:06,480
I can hear you breathe.

848
01:35:59,545 --> 01:36:00,211
What...

849
01:36:02,425 --> 01:36:04,694
What happened to us?

850
01:36:06,554 --> 01:36:07,383
What happened...

851
01:36:11,514 --> 01:36:13,041
I always did my best.

852
01:36:15,642 --> 01:36:17,431
I would've done the same
ifl had to live my life again.

853
01:36:19,482 --> 01:36:21,457
That was the only way for me.

854
01:36:25,018 --> 01:36:25,716
Why did you...

855
01:36:27,706 --> 01:36:29,494
Why did you tell me the truth?

856
01:36:31,162 --> 01:36:35,123
Why not hide it from me
and ask me to trust you?

857
01:36:37,114 --> 01:36:38,456
Why not...

858
01:36:42,010 --> 01:36:46,068
If you were me,
what would you have done?

859
01:36:48,218 --> 01:36:49,559
Would you have done differently?

860
01:36:51,385 --> 01:36:52,596
Would you...?

861
01:37:03,865 --> 01:37:06,680
I came back alive as you said.

862
01:37:07,801 --> 01:37:11,543
Now it's your turn
to keep your promise, sir.

863
01:37:49,402 --> 01:37:50,481
My eyes...

864
01:37:59,193 --> 01:38:00,087
My eyes...

865
01:38:03,226 --> 01:38:04,120
My eyes...

866
01:38:04,570 --> 01:38:06,106
I can't see...

867
01:38:06,106 --> 01:38:07,764
No!

868
01:38:08,218 --> 01:38:10,836
No!

869
01:38:42,170 --> 01:38:43,609
We've checked everywhere.

870
01:38:43,609 --> 01:38:44,754
He's the only Joseon man
we found.

871
01:38:48,409 --> 01:38:50,035
So these men
killed our soldiers?

872
01:38:52,026 --> 01:38:55,002
They were hiding...

873
01:38:55,002 --> 01:38:56,944
and suddenly jumped out
and attacked.

874
01:38:57,497 --> 01:38:58,872
I can't find any others.

875
01:38:59,225 --> 01:39:02,586
It looks like they killed
each other.

876
01:39:02,586 --> 01:39:03,862
What a brutal fight.

877
01:39:06,522 --> 01:39:09,817
I must live...

878
01:39:15,834 --> 01:39:17,111
Must go back...

879
01:39:21,305 --> 01:39:24,058
Wretched fool.

880
01:39:24,058 --> 01:39:26,578
Waking up
in a state like that.

881
01:39:26,938 --> 01:39:30,418
He looks like
a Joseon general.

882
01:39:31,834 --> 01:39:32,914
Should we seize him?

883
01:39:36,346 --> 01:39:38,866
No, we have
enough prisoners of war.

884
01:39:39,226 --> 01:39:40,120
We don't need him.

885
01:39:41,049 --> 01:39:42,227
Must return...

886
01:39:43,641 --> 01:39:45,016
Just leave him, sir?

887
01:39:48,826 --> 01:39:51,034
He'll die anyway.

888
01:39:51,034 --> 01:39:52,659
Leave him to die slowly.

889
01:39:55,449 --> 01:39:58,613
It'll be more painful that way.

890
01:40:07,418 --> 01:40:10,800
Why did Joseon send an army?

891
01:40:11,161 --> 01:40:13,878
When they have no reason
to fight?

892
01:40:14,330 --> 01:40:19,993
Joseon wanted to win
political favor with Ming.

893
01:40:20,761 --> 01:40:23,738
Then what about
the Joseon soldiers

894
01:40:23,738 --> 01:40:25,265
who died here?

895
01:40:25,658 --> 01:40:28,409
They died like dogs
for nothing...

896
01:40:28,409 --> 01:40:30,930
Just sent here to die.

897
01:40:30,931 --> 01:40:31,890
