1
00:00:23,854 --> 00:00:25,160
Coming!

2
00:00:27,963 --> 00:00:29,730
- Hello.
- Hello.

3
00:00:30,498 --> 00:00:33,254
Come in, Paula is in her room.

4
00:00:33,454 --> 00:00:36,757
Hold on,
I want to talk dates for the holidays.

5
00:00:37,525 --> 00:00:39,629
We already discussed it.

6
00:00:39,829 --> 00:00:40,866
I know.

7
00:00:43,861 --> 00:00:45,581
OK, what?

8
00:00:45,781 --> 00:00:49,237
This year,
I'd like to swap July for August.

9
00:00:50,197 --> 00:00:53,154
- What for?
- So Paula can go to Ojos Negros.

10
00:00:54,306 --> 00:00:56,294
You haven't been there for years.

11
00:00:56,494 --> 00:00:58,867
I'd like her to stay with my mother.

12
00:00:59,067 --> 00:01:03,406
- She barely knows her.
- So they can get to know each other.

13
00:01:04,866 --> 00:01:06,171
I don't know...

14
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:11,778
We've already made a plan...

15
00:01:12,277 --> 00:01:14,850
See if you can go some other time.

16
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:19,066
I think it's easier for you
to change dates.

17
00:01:19,266 --> 00:01:21,109
Easier for me?

18
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:26,515
The deal was she's with you in July
and with me in August.

19
00:01:26,715 --> 00:01:29,702
In August...
There are the festivities.

20
00:01:29,902 --> 00:01:30,902
So what?

21
00:01:31,093 --> 00:01:34,925
Well, there'll be more going on,
she'll have more fun.

22
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:37,574
I'll be 8 months pregnant by then,

23
00:01:37,774 --> 00:01:41,192
I'm not sure I'll be able
to spend time with her.

24
00:01:42,997 --> 00:01:45,062
So she'll be on her own?

25
00:01:45,262 --> 00:01:48,557
Not at all!
She'll be with my mum and my sister.

26
00:01:48,757 --> 00:01:49,978
Oh, fantastic...

27
00:01:50,178 --> 00:01:52,904
- Fuck, Miguel...
- No, not "fuck", Celia.

28
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:59,278
I'm not changing my plans
just because it suits you.

29
00:01:59,547 --> 00:02:02,611
- It's always about you!
- I'm asking a favour.

30
00:02:02,811 --> 00:02:05,606
OK, and I'm saying no!
That's it.

31
00:02:05,806 --> 00:02:07,227
Don't yell at me.

32
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:13,286
Mum is old,
she wants to see her granddaughter.

33
00:02:13,486 --> 00:02:16,550
You've never shown
any interest in your family!

34
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,546
Not once.
You want to fix everything now?

35
00:02:19,746 --> 00:02:24,123
- Yes, I do!
- That isn't how things work.

36
00:02:28,155 --> 00:02:30,912
- Miguel...
- Get your coat. I'll call Paula.

37
00:02:31,112 --> 00:02:33,754
- Get your coat and get out!
- Don't shout.

38
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:37,026
I'm not shouting!
You're making me angry.

39
00:02:42,555 --> 00:02:45,589
I said no.
What can't you understand?

40
00:02:46,472 --> 00:02:48,960
Take your coat and bag, please.

41
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,731
I'll get Paula.
Then you'll figure something out.

42
00:04:46,126 --> 00:04:49,621
Do you remember the house?
You were a kid last time.

43
00:04:53,077 --> 00:04:54,306
Not much.

44
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:59,566
But Mum showed me pictures.

45
00:06:02,965 --> 00:06:05,000
Close the trunk.

46
00:07:00,334 --> 00:07:01,755
Your room.

47
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:05,126
This is your bed.

48
00:07:05,326 --> 00:07:06,862
It was your mother's.

49
00:07:29,288 --> 00:07:30,939
You can start unpacking.

50
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:54,478
Put your underwear in the top drawer,
the two bottom ones are full.

51
00:08:20,206 --> 00:08:22,664
Celia, Mum and me.

52
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:24,661
Mind out the way.

53
00:08:51,618 --> 00:08:53,845
There are more photos in the attic.

54
00:08:54,728 --> 00:08:56,686
You can go up and see them.

55
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,875
OK.

56
00:09:02,715 --> 00:09:03,982
Elba...

57
00:09:04,405 --> 00:09:07,131
Where's the bathroom?
I'd like a shower.

58
00:09:07,976 --> 00:09:09,397
It's upstairs.

59
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:50,408
Go slowly, Mum.

60
00:09:54,056 --> 00:09:55,976
Look, Mum. There she is.

61
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:04,454
What do you say?

62
00:10:04,654 --> 00:10:06,382
She's all grown up.

63
00:10:07,496 --> 00:10:09,339
Give me a hug!

64
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:15,483
I'm so happy to see you.

65
00:10:16,635 --> 00:10:19,246
You've grown so much.

66
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,594
Eat up, Mum.

67
00:10:52,347 --> 00:10:55,650
Did you clean Celia's sheets?

68
00:10:59,758 --> 00:11:00,987
Yes, Mum.

69
00:11:03,445 --> 00:11:05,710
And it's Paula, not Celia.

70
00:11:06,363 --> 00:11:10,395
And the nightdress,
is it clean and pretty?

71
00:11:12,814 --> 00:11:13,966
Yes.

72
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:27,598
I've been so looking forward to
seeing you sitting here at the table.

73
00:11:27,944 --> 00:11:29,941
Well, Mum, she's here now.

74
00:11:30,747 --> 00:11:33,474
She could've come before.

75
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:36,699
I'm not the one
you should be telling.

76
00:14:41,634 --> 00:14:46,011
- Wait, she might wake up!
- Don't worry, it's fine.

77
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,230
Would she be scared?

78
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:10,741
- Wait, wait...
- OK.

79
00:15:26,754 --> 00:15:28,474
How did this tree grow?

80
00:15:28,674 --> 00:15:32,890
It grew because a fruit fell,

81
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:37,813
and a small tree grew from it,
but look how big it is now.

82
00:15:38,158 --> 00:15:40,685
It's a loquat,
or some name like that.

83
00:15:40,885 --> 00:15:44,840
The fruits had stones inside

84
00:15:45,224 --> 00:15:46,598
and were a bit tough.

85
00:15:46,798 --> 00:15:48,634
And what's this tree?

86
00:15:48,834 --> 00:15:51,099
That's a loquat.

87
00:15:52,674 --> 00:15:54,662
And that other one is...

88
00:15:54,862 --> 00:15:57,504
- Do you know what this one is?
- What?

89
00:15:57,704 --> 00:16:00,499
- What sort of tree is this?
- I don't know.

90
00:16:00,699 --> 00:16:05,461
It has these little things here,
but I don't know what it is.

91
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:09,992
I can recognise a fig tree.

92
00:16:12,181 --> 00:16:16,981
- Are these fruits?
- No, they look like grapes.

93
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:20,429
But I don't think they're edible.

94
00:16:20,629 --> 00:16:21,973
I don't think so.

95
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:27,349
This one here has grown so big.

96
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:31,496
It used to be small,

97
00:16:31,995 --> 00:16:33,638
but look how big it's got.

98
00:16:33,838 --> 00:16:36,258
- This one?
- Yes, yes.

99
00:16:37,294 --> 00:16:40,858
You know,
that's the thing about trees.

100
00:16:41,058 --> 00:16:45,858
You plant them and then
in a year or two, they grow big.

101
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:26,150
Give me your bike!
My cousin's in that car!

102
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:30,190
- He could kill someone!
- Carlos, stop!

103
00:18:30,459 --> 00:18:32,341
Stop him!

104
00:18:41,864 --> 00:18:43,938
Are you crazy?

105
00:18:45,128 --> 00:18:46,357
Let's go.

106
00:18:54,574 --> 00:18:55,688
Thanks.

107
00:19:01,448 --> 00:19:05,126
- How did you do this? Did you fall?
- I fell off my bike.

108
00:19:05,326 --> 00:19:07,016
Fell off your bike?

109
00:19:08,168 --> 00:19:11,394
It’s good that you came to see me.

110
00:19:11,893 --> 00:19:13,459
It could've got worse.

111
00:19:13,659 --> 00:19:16,846
- Are you going to tell your grandma?
- No.

112
00:19:23,566 --> 00:19:26,600
- Do you often hit him like that?
- He's a kid.

113
00:19:29,365 --> 00:19:30,547
He has to learn.

114
00:19:30,747 --> 00:19:32,245
And you're not a kid?

115
00:19:37,621 --> 00:19:38,621
No.

116
00:19:40,309 --> 00:19:41,691
And neither are you.

117
00:19:47,528 --> 00:19:48,680
See?

118
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:51,514
It doesn't hurt anymore, does it?

119
00:19:51,714 --> 00:19:53,211
He's my son.

120
00:19:54,478 --> 00:19:56,168
His name's Carlos.

121
00:19:57,128 --> 00:19:58,195
I don't believe that.

122
00:19:58,395 --> 00:20:01,006
- Why?
- Because it's a lie.

123
00:20:01,275 --> 00:20:02,926
Don't you ever lie?

124
00:20:03,426 --> 00:20:07,304
- Not much. Do you?
- I lie all the time.

125
00:20:07,688 --> 00:20:10,453
- Why?
- Because it's funny.

126
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:49,766
- Here's another quail.
- I have enough, Rodrigo.

127
00:20:49,966 --> 00:20:52,386
There are three of you to eat them.

128
00:20:59,605 --> 00:21:00,403
Jara!

129
00:21:00,603 --> 00:21:02,400
Stop it! Jara!

130
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,827
Let me introduce a family friend.

131
00:21:07,861 --> 00:21:09,466
- This is Rodrigo.
- Hello.

132
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:12,000
- Here for a few days?
- For the summer.

133
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:12,960
Nice.

134
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,080
She'll probably want to stay.

135
00:21:16,194 --> 00:21:17,691
Ladies, I have to go.

136
00:21:19,419 --> 00:21:21,608
Come on, Jara, let's go.

137
00:21:23,106 --> 00:21:24,949
Up you get!

138
00:22:35,797 --> 00:22:37,210
Alicia!

139
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:39,714
Alicia!

140
00:22:41,979 --> 00:22:43,400
You first.

141
00:22:44,667 --> 00:22:47,432
Now the new girl!
Now the new girl!

142
00:22:48,008 --> 00:22:50,235
Now the new girl!

143
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:54,651
Go, Alicia!

144
00:23:35,278 --> 00:23:36,430
Is that her?

145
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:37,930
Yes.

146
00:23:38,965 --> 00:23:41,077
She doesn't look like you at all.

147
00:23:41,614 --> 00:23:43,688
She doesn't look like my mum either.

148
00:23:46,645 --> 00:23:48,211
Is she with that guy?

149
00:23:48,411 --> 00:23:50,131
I know him.

150
00:23:50,331 --> 00:23:52,635
His dog ate my grandma’s chickens.

151
00:23:53,019 --> 00:23:54,978
What do you think of him?

152
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,050
I don't like him.

153
00:24:18,018 --> 00:24:20,045
Your grandma wanted to see you.

154
00:24:20,245 --> 00:24:23,040
Go see her now
and leave this to me.

155
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,930
I'll do it.

156
00:26:05,077 --> 00:26:06,190
Grab the collar.

157
00:26:07,227 --> 00:26:08,533
I'm scared.

158
00:26:09,608 --> 00:26:12,872
If you hold her like this,
she won't hurt you.

159
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:20,206
Come on.

160
00:26:25,045 --> 00:26:26,389
Let's go.

161
00:26:35,106 --> 00:26:36,373
Come on.

162
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:39,790
Hurry up!

163
00:26:41,134 --> 00:26:42,286
Here.

164
00:26:43,861 --> 00:26:45,397
Come on, move.

165
00:26:47,163 --> 00:26:48,354
Come on.

166
00:26:49,006 --> 00:26:50,274
Push her.

167
00:26:51,349 --> 00:26:54,382
- What now?
- Wait, I'll throw something.

168
00:26:58,530 --> 00:26:59,912
Let's go!

169
00:27:32,053 --> 00:27:33,581
Is that a fish?

170
00:27:33,781 --> 00:27:36,730
Paula! Did you see that fish?

171
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:39,234
What fish?

172
00:28:33,339 --> 00:28:34,530
Jara!

173
00:28:36,258 --> 00:28:37,563
Jara!

174
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:40,827
Jara, come here!

175
00:28:54,805 --> 00:28:57,454
Paula, I need to come in.

176
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,563
You need to shower faster.

177
00:29:20,763 --> 00:29:23,298
We only have one bathroom.

178
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:44,648
And you don't need to lock the door.

179
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:02,227
- Are you going out?
- Yes.

180
00:30:02,427 --> 00:30:04,194
Take care of your grandma.

181
00:30:59,374 --> 00:31:00,872
Do they hurt a lot?

182
00:31:01,678 --> 00:31:02,715
No.

183
00:31:08,552 --> 00:31:09,819
Do you want to stop?

184
00:31:27,445 --> 00:31:29,096
This place looks familiar.

185
00:31:29,518 --> 00:31:31,246
Maybe you've seen photos of it.

186
00:31:36,315 --> 00:31:40,877
One time, my mum showed me
pictures of her when she was young

187
00:31:41,077 --> 00:31:42,605
and I started crying.

188
00:31:42,805 --> 00:31:43,918
Why?

189
00:31:44,533 --> 00:31:49,294
Because so much time had passed
and it meant she was getting older.

190
00:31:51,176 --> 00:31:53,019
I had something similar.

191
00:31:53,634 --> 00:31:54,670
What?

192
00:31:55,285 --> 00:31:58,894
I asked my mum
what happens after we die.

193
00:31:59,355 --> 00:32:03,302
She told me some people believe
that there's another life,

194
00:32:03,502 --> 00:32:05,453
but we don't remember this one.

195
00:32:05,653 --> 00:32:09,139
So I was sad because
I thought I wouldn't remember

196
00:32:09,339 --> 00:32:11,750
my family or my friends.

197
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:14,638
I cried for like three weeks.

198
00:32:27,272 --> 00:32:29,576
Heels was a stupid idea.

199
00:32:29,998 --> 00:32:31,035
Yeah.

200
00:32:33,531 --> 00:32:35,597
I won't wear them when I grow up.

201
00:32:35,797 --> 00:32:37,294
Yeah, sure.

202
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:42,478
I'm never going to grow up.

203
00:32:52,539 --> 00:32:55,112
That one. That one!

204
00:32:57,454 --> 00:32:58,675
Quick!

205
00:32:58,875 --> 00:33:00,373
One, two, three!

206
00:33:02,792 --> 00:33:03,829
I won again.

207
00:33:04,213 --> 00:33:06,394
Mine was much heavier.

208
00:33:06,594 --> 00:33:08,821
No. I won.

209
00:33:19,342 --> 00:33:22,184
What do you do
with your mates in Zaragoza?

210
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,947
Nothing much.

211
00:33:27,176 --> 00:33:28,942
I hardly see them.

212
00:33:29,403 --> 00:33:30,478
Why not?

213
00:33:32,974 --> 00:33:34,818
They're a bit boring.

214
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,542
I'm not interested in what they do.

215
00:33:43,726 --> 00:33:45,378
So I'm not boring?

216
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:46,798
Well...

217
00:33:55,054 --> 00:33:56,552
You're different.

218
00:33:57,666 --> 00:33:59,778
And you do cool things.

219
00:34:00,546 --> 00:34:02,389
You're cool too.

220
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:10,146
Luckily, it wasn't serious.

221
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:13,410
Yes, but she still had quite a scare.

222
00:36:21,051 --> 00:36:23,893
Don't put it there,
you'll stain the cloth.

223
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,165
We brought roast chicken.

224
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:44,706
Not much though.
I wasn't expecting you to be here.

225
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:52,846
Where are you going?
Pass me the plates, please.

226
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:10,126
Hold on.

227
00:37:47,106 --> 00:37:49,064
Do you need anything else?

228
00:37:50,446 --> 00:37:51,936
Is she home?

229
00:37:52,136 --> 00:37:54,133
Yes, Mum. She's in her room.

230
00:38:00,546 --> 00:38:03,349
Hold on, I'll help you lie down.

231
00:38:19,285 --> 00:38:20,851
My back hurts...

232
00:38:21,051 --> 00:38:23,816
OK, Mum,
we'll soon be at the hospital.

233
00:38:25,506 --> 00:38:27,387
Let me close the door.

234
00:40:52,232 --> 00:40:53,998
What are you thinking about?

235
00:40:54,958 --> 00:40:56,379
About the party.

236
00:40:58,069 --> 00:40:59,490
No, you weren't.

237
00:41:01,486 --> 00:41:02,523
I know.

238
00:41:04,981 --> 00:41:06,632
So what is it?

239
00:41:07,707 --> 00:41:08,859
Nothing.

240
00:41:09,819 --> 00:41:11,931
Aren't you going to tell me?

241
00:41:28,635 --> 00:41:31,622
I remember the first time we spoke.

242
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:34,318
I knew then we could be friends.

243
00:41:37,928 --> 00:41:40,109
I was thinking that next summer

244
00:41:40,309 --> 00:41:42,912
I could bring my dad's tent

245
00:41:43,112 --> 00:41:45,339
and we could stay longer here.

246
00:41:50,677 --> 00:41:52,443
Would you like that?

247
00:41:54,786 --> 00:41:58,050
Yes, but I'm not sure
I'll come next year.

248
00:41:58,856 --> 00:42:02,734
Why wouldn't you?
You come every year.

249
00:42:03,426 --> 00:42:06,997
But it's not up to me.
It's up to my parents.

250
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:14,946
Will you definitely come back?

251
00:42:16,021 --> 00:42:17,557
I don't know.

252
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:22,664
But you could always come visit me.

253
00:42:28,386 --> 00:42:30,336
I don't think they'd let me.

254
00:42:30,536 --> 00:42:33,646
- Why not?
- Because they don't know you.

255
00:42:34,606 --> 00:42:39,138
Yeah, but my dad could talk to them.

256
00:42:53,538 --> 00:42:55,918
But I don't know if I want to.

257
00:42:59,221 --> 00:43:01,371
What's the problem?

258
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:05,518
I don't know, Paula,
we live so far away.

259
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:13,966
- So what?
- We won't see each other.

260
00:43:22,875 --> 00:43:25,256
We'll end up forgetting each other.

261
00:43:27,867 --> 00:43:29,826
What makes you think that?

262
00:43:30,978 --> 00:43:32,706
I won't forget you.

263
00:43:41,691 --> 00:43:43,803
You don't understand, Paula.

264
00:44:26,005 --> 00:44:27,848
Hi, Celia, it's me.

265
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:30,989
Mum is very ill.

266
00:44:31,189 --> 00:44:32,994
When are you coming?

267
00:44:36,104 --> 00:44:37,294
I see.

268
00:44:37,870 --> 00:44:39,483
Can't it be any sooner?

269
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:34,664
- May I come in?
- Yes, sweetie, come.

270
00:45:45,454 --> 00:45:47,720
Sit here with me.

271
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:59,240
You haven't come to say goodnight
these last few days.

272
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:03,426
- Are you angry with me?
- No.

273
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:07,803
- Have you made some friends?
- Yes, a few.

274
00:46:09,032 --> 00:46:13,363
Do you like them very much,
and do they like you?

275
00:46:13,563 --> 00:46:14,976
Yes.

276
00:46:15,176 --> 00:46:19,046
And which one likes you most,

277
00:46:19,246 --> 00:46:21,274
and who do you like the most?

278
00:46:21,474 --> 00:46:24,346
Well, there's a girl
I get on well with.

279
00:46:24,546 --> 00:46:26,389
What's her name?

280
00:46:27,310 --> 00:46:28,578
Alicia.

281
00:46:29,845 --> 00:46:33,869
Well, now that you have friends here,

282
00:46:34,069 --> 00:46:37,141
you'll come back...

283
00:46:37,794 --> 00:46:40,358
next summer...

284
00:46:40,558 --> 00:46:44,245
and you'll come to see me too,
won't you?

285
00:46:49,813 --> 00:46:51,118
Yes.

286
00:47:50,754 --> 00:47:53,626
Come and dance.
You know you want to.

287
00:47:53,826 --> 00:47:54,970
No, I'm fine.

288
00:47:55,170 --> 00:47:57,243
I don't really like dancing.

289
00:48:02,734 --> 00:48:04,078
What's wrong?

290
00:48:05,115 --> 00:48:06,797
Are you tired?

291
00:48:06,997 --> 00:48:08,264
A bit.

292
00:48:25,198 --> 00:48:28,117
Come on.
We all know you want to dance.

293
00:49:59,854 --> 00:50:02,619
- Wow, Alicia.
- Nice one!

294
00:50:03,502 --> 00:50:04,923
Fuck!

295
00:50:06,382 --> 00:50:10,837
Not this weekend,
but maybe for the party.

296
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:28,128
So has she been good?

297
00:51:28,328 --> 00:51:30,547
Yes, very good.

298
00:51:30,747 --> 00:51:33,358
She adapted really well.

299
00:51:34,088 --> 00:51:35,424
She's very polite.

300
00:51:35,624 --> 00:51:38,120
Made lots of friends.
Well, a few.

301
00:51:40,693 --> 00:51:42,382
She's a sweetheart.

302
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:05,653
Aren't you going to ask me about Mum?

303
00:52:07,227 --> 00:52:08,486
Yes, of course.

304
00:52:08,686 --> 00:52:10,299
How's Mum?

305
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:14,101
Don't bother, Celia.

306
00:52:15,330 --> 00:52:18,278
Don't give me that!
I'm tired too, you know.

307
00:52:18,478 --> 00:52:21,427
- You haven't helped at all.
- Don't say that.

308
00:52:21,627 --> 00:52:23,923
I say what I want in my own house.

309
00:52:24,123 --> 00:52:26,189
You're so ungrateful.

310
00:52:26,389 --> 00:52:29,299
- You poor victim.
- No, poor you!

311
00:52:29,499 --> 00:52:31,334
You turn up like a princess

312
00:52:31,534 --> 00:52:35,366
expecting everyone to admire you
and your wonderful life.

313
00:52:35,566 --> 00:52:37,256
You don't care about us.

314
00:52:39,061 --> 00:52:40,589
There were other options.

315
00:52:40,789 --> 00:52:42,432
Not here there weren't.

316
00:52:42,632 --> 00:52:45,619
A sick woman
can't be left alone here.

317
00:52:45,819 --> 00:52:49,690
You've never once asked
if we needed help

318
00:52:49,890 --> 00:52:52,992
with the bills,
or anything for that matter!

319
00:52:53,192 --> 00:52:55,834
That's just pure selfishness.

320
00:52:56,034 --> 00:52:58,330
No other name for it.

321
00:52:58,530 --> 00:53:02,093
I don't feel guilty
for choosing to live my life.

322
00:53:02,293 --> 00:53:04,166
You could've done the same.

323
00:53:04,366 --> 00:53:06,547
- Don't blame me.
- As I said,

324
00:53:06,747 --> 00:53:09,850
you've lived your life
and done what you wanted.

325
00:53:10,050 --> 00:53:13,536
You decided to take
and I decided to give.

326
00:53:13,736 --> 00:53:15,994
No, wait, I had no choice,

327
00:53:16,194 --> 00:53:20,187
because you never helped,
despite being her daughter too.

328
00:53:20,456 --> 00:53:23,674
Did you expect me to stay
where I wasn't wanted?

329
00:53:23,874 --> 00:53:25,755
Come on, Elba.

330
00:53:43,189 --> 00:53:46,261
Darling! There you are.
How are you?

331
00:53:48,411 --> 00:53:49,411
How are you?

332
00:53:49,794 --> 00:53:51,253
Fine.

333
00:53:53,672 --> 00:53:58,080
- I thought you were coming next week.
- I took my holidays early.

334
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:01,006
- Why? Want to come home already?
- Yeah.

335
00:54:01,774 --> 00:54:04,578
A friend of yours came by earlier.

336
00:54:05,422 --> 00:54:07,688
I think she wanted to say goodbye.

337
00:54:08,341 --> 00:54:09,341
Alicia?

338
00:54:09,454 --> 00:54:10,829
I don't know.

339
00:54:11,029 --> 00:54:14,446
I don't know her name.
A blonde.

340
00:54:19,554 --> 00:54:20,698
Is she leaving?

341
00:54:20,898 --> 00:54:23,317
Looks like it.

342
00:54:28,424 --> 00:54:30,413
Can I go out for a while?

343
00:54:30,613 --> 00:54:32,379
Wait until after lunch.

344
00:54:34,261 --> 00:54:36,334
I need to go now.

345
00:54:36,757 --> 00:54:39,906
Paula, don't be stubborn.
Wait a while, OK?

346
00:54:41,173 --> 00:54:43,438
- I have to go now.
- Paula!

347
00:54:44,821 --> 00:54:46,894
- Do you want sugar?
- No.

348
00:55:35,662 --> 00:55:37,083
We're leaving now.

349
00:57:03,982 --> 00:57:05,749
Have you packed your suitcase?

350
00:57:05,979 --> 00:57:07,093
No.

351
00:57:19,342 --> 00:57:21,830
We're not leaving until after lunch.

352
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:23,989
We can do it together.

353
00:57:35,086 --> 00:57:36,576
Goodnight, sweetie.

354
00:57:36,776 --> 00:57:38,274
Goodnight.
