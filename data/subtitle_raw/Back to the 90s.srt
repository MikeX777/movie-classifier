Kong.

3
00:00:25,584 --> 00:00:28,375
Yes, mom.

4
00:00:30,417 --> 00:00:33,167
Get home and don't rush out today, ok?

5
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:35,084
What's going on?

6
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:40,792
It's your dad's anniversary with me.

7
00:00:45,792 --> 00:00:46,917
Why?

8
00:00:50,667 --> 00:00:53,500
He'll work and forget just like every year.

9
00:00:57,834 --> 00:01:02,667
'Kay, mom... see you soon.

10
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:32,084
Sometimes we are still confused.

11
00:01:32,917 --> 00:01:35,917
We don't know where to go.

12
00:01:36,542 --> 00:01:40,000
Never know who we really are.

13
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:45,167
Yeah, this is called aero-dynamic.

14
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,834
My throat hurts now.

15
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,459
- Here...
- What are you doing?

16
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,000
I've read about it.

17
00:01:52,209 --> 00:01:54,125
It generates more speed.

18
00:01:54,167 --> 00:01:57,167
Didn't you see how the racers lean on their bike?

19
00:01:57,334 --> 00:01:58,625
- Show us.
- Do it.

20
00:01:58,667 --> 00:01:59,750
Shit, that's aero-autistic.

21
00:01:59,792 --> 00:02:01,292
Make it look more energetic, yeah.

22
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:02,375
Hey!

23
00:02:27,084 --> 00:02:28,625
That was awesome.

24
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:32,917
Here's your phone.

25
00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:35,000
Hold it tight. Here.

26
00:02:44,917 --> 00:02:46,117
Did anyone do anything to him?

27
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:48,042
It's you!

28
00:02:49,542 --> 00:02:51,584
He's had a concussion,
blood goes to his hair instead.

29
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:52,865
- All is good.
- Let's continue.

30
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,667

Call me back 9482092

34
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:53,125
On facebook feeds,

35
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:55,500
A lot of people share updates about the storm.

36
00:04:55,709 --> 00:04:57,292
Please be cautious and take care.

37
00:04:57,334 --> 00:05:00,209
Let's hear this, a new single from Polycat

00:05:23,667 --> 00:05:25,084
Paclink

Pager

40
00:05:27,667 --> 00:05:29,500
You said you won't forget.

41
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,167
What time is it now, you just got back? Huh?

42
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,417
Mam...

43
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:34,334
All these years...

44
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,584
I had to work.

45
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,584
When will we celebrate anniversary together?

46
00:05:41,042 --> 00:05:41,834
I'm sorry.

47
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:51,334
We have been married for 20 years.

48
00:05:52,292 --> 00:05:53,542
But you never...

49
00:05:55,709 --> 00:05:56,709
never forget Som, do you?

50
00:05:56,792 --> 00:06:00,084
Hey, I think we made that clear already.

51
00:06:01,167 --> 00:06:03,042
Why do you have to get Som involved?

52
00:06:03,417 --> 00:06:04,334
Tum, I love you forever. - Som

53
00:06:04,542 --> 00:06:05,375
Why?

54
00:06:06,334 --> 00:06:07,000
Why?

55
00:06:07,584 --> 00:06:09,959
I can't even talk about her?

56
00:06:22,917 --> 00:06:24,792
Mam, Mam.

57
00:06:40,209 --> 00:06:41,584
Will there be just one time

58
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:44,459
that you make us all happy?

59
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:49,292
Kong, this is adult's matter. Not yours.

60
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:51,542
And this...

61
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:54,500
is also adult's matter as well, huh?

62
00:07:05,417 --> 00:07:06,209
Kong.

63
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,792
Can you come here now?

64
00:07:07,834 --> 00:07:08,542
What?

65
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:10,292
I had argument with my dad.

66
00:07:10,542 --> 00:07:11,125
Again?

67
00:07:11,292 --> 00:07:12,917
Yeah, come to see me.

68
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,000
OK.

69
00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:16,625
I'll see you. At your house, ok?

70
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,000
Hey, it's raining.

71
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,750
Shit.

72
00:07:25,667 --> 00:07:26,709
Hey, hello?

73
00:07:29,542 --> 00:07:30,834
Hey, can you hear me?

74
00:07:31,209 --> 00:07:31,750
Hello?

75
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,709
Hello?

76
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:38,959
- AUM
- Broken.

77
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,084
Shit.

78
00:07:54,917 --> 00:07:57,667

84
00:08:32,584 --> 00:08:35,709
Tum, what are you doing?

85
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:40,792
I've just get to look at your roof.

86
00:08:41,834 --> 00:08:43,000
Good night.

87
00:08:44,167 --> 00:08:45,417
From Som.

88
00:08:46,917 --> 00:08:48,334
Thank you for choosing our service.

89
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:49,042
Yes.

90
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:02,834
You pervert!

91
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,084
Wait! Hey!

92
00:09:05,584 --> 00:09:06,792
Wait! Hey!

93
00:09:24,042 --> 00:09:27,500
Even though I don't want to.

94
00:09:28,459 --> 00:09:29,167
Hey, bro.

95
00:09:31,084 --> 00:09:33,667
Is this the market behind Rachasart University?

96
00:09:33,917 --> 00:09:34,542
Yes.

97
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,875
Where is 7-11?

98
00:09:42,334 --> 00:09:43,792
7 what? There's no such thing.

99
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:44,709
Huh?

100
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,042
Why are you freaking out?

101
00:09:58,292 --> 00:09:59,000
"3 July 1995"

102
00:09:59,042 --> 00:09:59,875
Bro!

103
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:02,709
Why are you selling old newspaper?

104
00:10:03,084 --> 00:10:04,709
They are not old, this is the latest.

105
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,042
1995?

106
00:10:06,584 --> 00:10:07,292
Yes, pal.

107
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:08,625
You're funny.

108
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:10,959
Hey, do you think we are friends?

109
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,459
Aren't you on high?

110
00:10:23,667 --> 00:10:24,667
What's that, Tum?

111
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,459
Pager.

112
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,125
Why did Som have to text you?

113
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:30,792
Why did she say sweet dreams?

114
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,500
Better than bad dreams, Mam.

115
00:10:32,709 --> 00:10:34,459
Why did she has to see your roof?

116
00:10:35,209 --> 00:10:36,875
Doesn't she have the roof at her house?

117
00:10:37,292 --> 00:10:39,417
It's not just one message,
she texts you every night.

118
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:41,035
She is like my little sister.

119
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:42,292
What's wrong with you?

120
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:43,792
Are we fighting again?

121
00:10:44,167 --> 00:10:44,709
Sister?

122
00:10:44,834 --> 00:10:46,417
Stop seeing her then.

123
00:10:46,792 --> 00:10:47,834
What did she do wrong?

124
00:10:48,084 --> 00:10:49,417
Then what did I do wrong?

125
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,125
Why are you knocking?

126
00:10:58,709 --> 00:10:59,542
It's closed now.

127
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:01,459
Dad!

128
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,500
Dad my ass.

129
00:11:03,542 --> 00:11:05,209
I'm closing, come again tomorrow.

130
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,667
Mam, where are you going?

131
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,429
- Wake up! Wake up!
- Get away, I'm leaving.

132
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,625
- Mam, we haven't finished talking.
- Mam?

133
00:11:14,084 --> 00:11:15,500
No more talking.

134
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:17,042
I want to break up.

135
00:11:18,417 --> 00:11:19,125
Mom!

136
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:21,000
Are you crazy?

137
00:11:21,542 --> 00:11:22,209
Mam!

138
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:22,834
Mom!

139
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:23,750
- Mam.
- Mom.

140
00:11:23,792 --> 00:11:24,792
- Mam.
- Mom.

141
00:11:25,334 --> 00:11:26,292
- Mam.
- Mom.

142
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:27,417
What mom?

143
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,334
What mom, huh?

144
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,334
D... Dad...

145
00:11:34,834 --> 00:11:35,959
Oh, man!

146
00:11:37,667 --> 00:11:38,542
Kong.

147
00:11:39,584 --> 00:11:40,417
Kong.

148
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:43,709
Kong, what's wrong?

149
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,334
Kong!

150
00:11:46,209 --> 00:11:47,250
Hey, how is it going?

151
00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:48,209
Dad.

152
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:51,042
Dad my ass, stop calling for your dad.

153
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,500
Where is he, your dad?

154
00:11:53,917 --> 00:11:55,292
You wake up now, boy?

155
00:11:59,334 --> 00:11:59,917
Ghost!

156
00:12:00,584 --> 00:12:01,709
What ghost is this?

157
00:12:03,292 --> 00:12:04,542
Ghost... Ghost... Ghost...

158
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,584
- I'm not a ghost.
- You're the ghost.

159
00:12:10,834 --> 00:12:13,000
He was calling for his dad in front of the house.

160
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:14,709
I looked back to talk to Mam,

161
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,584
he already passed out when I turned back.

162
00:12:17,417 --> 00:12:17,959
Yeah?

163
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,875
This is not a dream.

164
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:25,917
What is your name?

165
00:12:26,334 --> 00:12:27,375
Where is your home?

166
00:12:28,334 --> 00:12:30,500
Name... my name is Kong.

167
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,042
My home?

168
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:32,750
Yeah.

169
00:12:34,209 --> 00:12:35,167
It's here.

170
00:12:37,292 --> 00:12:38,750
I think he is stoned.

171
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:41,292
You should call the police.

172
00:12:41,584 --> 00:12:42,000
Good.

173
00:12:42,042 --> 00:12:43,625
Wait, wait. Please wait.

174
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:47,792
I come from the future.

175
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,792
Enough, don't call the police.

176
00:12:52,209 --> 00:12:55,584
Now call the psycho ward to come get him.

177
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:56,709
That's good, uncle.

178
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,375
Stop, calm down. Let me explain.

179
00:13:02,667 --> 00:13:04,209
Wanted - Sales assistance

180
00:13:04,542 --> 00:13:05,667
I come to find a job.

181
00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:09,542
So you're looking for a job
or you come from the future?

182
00:13:09,792 --> 00:13:12,792
If I can get a job here, then I have my future.

183
00:13:14,334 --> 00:13:16,917
I have an argument with my dad.

184
00:13:17,334 --> 00:13:19,167
And I ran away from home.

185
00:13:19,417 --> 00:13:21,709
I really have nowhere to go.

186
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,042
I beg you, please.

187
00:13:27,084 --> 00:13:29,000
If I can find another place, I will leave.

188
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:30,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

189
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:34,334
I'm not a cruel person, I can be moral.

190
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:38,792
Are you crazy?

191
00:13:40,084 --> 00:13:41,084
- Get out.
- Go.

192
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:04,125
Modern Dog No.1 Hits

193
00:14:08,542 --> 00:14:09,167
Oh?

194
00:14:27,459 --> 00:14:28,625
What's wrong with it?

195
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,000
Bro! You make a call or not?

196
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:51,584
What takes you so long?

197
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,959
Sorry, I forgot the number.

198
00:15:01,209 --> 00:15:02,792
Why don't you use phone book?

199
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:11,459
Through the lonely nights

200
00:15:12,417 --> 00:15:17,167
and pointless days.

201
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:22,250
It's the thoughtless day

202
00:15:23,709 --> 00:15:28,292
and the endless night.

203
00:15:29,417 --> 00:15:34,209
There is a painful story

204
00:15:35,084 --> 00:15:39,375
that everyone has been through.

205
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:44,459
On the day we make mistakes

206
00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:51,167
You'll fully understand when it happens.

207
00:15:52,709 --> 00:15:57,292
Talk about love.

208
00:15:58,334 --> 00:16:04,542
Talk about sadness.

209
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:11,375
Talk about loneliness.

210
00:16:12,584 --> 00:16:17,084
Talk about stories in my heart.

211
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:34,125
Through those happy days.

212
00:16:38,042 --> 00:16:39,584
This just keeps eating the tape.

213
00:16:43,042 --> 00:16:44,459
Oh crap!

214
00:16:48,584 --> 00:16:49,542
What are you doing?

215
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:50,667
Rewinding the cassette tape.

216
00:16:50,834 --> 00:16:52,625
Or you think I'm cleaning it up?

217
00:16:54,917 --> 00:16:56,459
Do you not go to school today?

218
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,584
No, I'm lazy.

219
00:17:00,542 --> 00:17:01,125
Huh?

220
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:05,125
And... don't you help uncle at the shop?

221
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:07,167
No, I'm lazy.

222
00:17:07,584 --> 00:17:08,084
Huh?

223
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:10,709
You're lazy?

224
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:14,667
Why? Do I look like a hard working person?

225
00:17:15,042 --> 00:17:15,584
Well...

226
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,375
I don't know.
I think you take everything seriously.

227
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:20,500
No humour.

228
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,292
- Don't care about people around you.
- Huh?

229
00:17:22,334 --> 00:17:24,459
- Always make people uncomfortable.
- Hey.

230
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:26,325
Are you talking shit about me?

231
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,709
Want me kick your ass?

232
00:17:28,542 --> 00:17:30,125
Just kidding.

233
00:17:32,417 --> 00:17:33,167
Forget it.

234
00:17:34,459 --> 00:17:35,375
I'll be out.

235
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:39,375
If you're hungry, just take care of it yourself.

236
00:17:40,209 --> 00:17:41,375
I have a rehearsal.

237
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:44,042
Huh? Wait, you're in a band?

238
00:17:45,584 --> 00:17:47,459
You live around here, don't you know my band?

239
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:50,875
Nope.

240
00:17:58,042 --> 00:18:00,167
Buy this, and you'll know.

241
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,459
CONCERT ALTERNATIVE -
PROUD meet Warm Up Band - TTNK

242
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,020
Are you tricking me to buy the ticket?

243
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:08,500
When I have the album released,

244
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:11,042
the ticket will be even more expensive.

245
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,542
Give me the money.

246
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,167
It's ok.

247
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,167
Don't worry, you can keep it.

248
00:18:21,209 --> 00:18:23,292
Give me the money when you can. I'm in no rush.

249
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:28,542
Where do you go for rehearsal?

250
00:18:29,417 --> 00:18:30,375
At the university.

251
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,125
Great, can I come along?

252
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:35,750
I need to use internet.

253
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:36,875
Internet?

254
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:38,417
Yes.

255
00:18:44,834 --> 00:18:47,959
You're lazy, I can see it.

256
00:18:48,459 --> 00:18:51,334
You can actually take care of the shop yourself.

257
00:18:51,709 --> 00:18:53,917
There is no need for another person.

258
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,000
I feel sorry for him.

259
00:18:57,792 --> 00:18:59,709
Is he from an ice age?

260
00:19:02,084 --> 00:19:05,000
He doesn't know any songs or singers.

261
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:10,292
He also told me that that singer is gay.

262
00:19:10,459 --> 00:19:11,250
He is gay.

263
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:14,375
Here, brother. There are 4 guys in this band.

264
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:15,792
One of them is gay.

265
00:19:17,709 --> 00:19:18,959
You don't believe me?

266
00:19:20,042 --> 00:19:23,042
Here, there are 6 in this band.

267
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,125
One of them is gay.

268
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:28,084
I don't believe you.

269
00:19:30,292 --> 00:19:31,042
Are you crazy?

270
00:19:31,709 --> 00:19:32,709
Gay?

271
00:19:33,167 --> 00:19:34,417
I told you to be a salesman,

272
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,417
not to tell them who is gay.

273
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,792
If the sales drops, don't you wish...

274
00:19:44,667 --> 00:19:47,375
that you'll get time off for holiday with Mam.

275
00:19:49,917 --> 00:19:51,292
That won't happen anyway.

276
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,375
We broke up last night.

277
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:56,584
Broke up?

278
00:19:59,167 --> 00:20:01,334
Listen to this then. Here, here, here.

279
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,834
Assanee, Nuvo, Micro.

280
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,875
The heartbroken gangsters songs.

281
00:20:07,834 --> 00:20:11,625
The songs are spot on.

282
00:20:14,959 --> 00:20:16,167
I'm sorry, uncle.

283
00:20:17,334 --> 00:20:18,417
I'm "Alter"

284
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,334
Alternative, that is.

285
00:20:27,584 --> 00:20:30,125
Here, bro. The fastest internet in campus.

286
00:20:30,542 --> 00:20:31,542
64 K.

287
00:20:32,417 --> 00:20:33,875
What do you want from the internet?

288
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:36,084
Just ask me, I know everything.

289
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,042
I'd like to go on google.

290
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,125
- Google?
- Yes.

291
00:20:41,334 --> 00:20:42,574
You're getting a guru confused.

292
00:20:43,167 --> 00:20:44,334
What is it?

293
00:20:44,834 --> 00:20:45,875
It is...

294
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:49,125
It's a website for searching information.

295
00:20:49,459 --> 00:20:50,339
Searching information?

296
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,834
Yes, google.

297
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:53,834
There is no google.

298
00:20:54,292 --> 00:20:57,042
But there is a guru that can help you.

299
00:20:58,042 --> 00:20:59,792
I'm the guru you're looking for.

300
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:01,167
Librarian

301
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,000
What are you looking for?

302
00:21:19,417 --> 00:21:20,334
Sorry.

303
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:32,542
Som, I'm leaving now. I'm bored.

304
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:33,667
See you.

305
00:22:02,292 --> 00:22:03,084
You pervert!

306
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,542
You!

307
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:23,167
Theory of Relativity and Time Traveling

308
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:23,834
Hey!

309
00:22:27,792 --> 00:22:28,417
Hey!

310
00:22:30,917 --> 00:22:31,500
Hey!

311
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:34,959
Hey!

312
00:22:37,084 --> 00:22:37,667
Hey!

313
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:42,417
Hey!

314
00:22:45,334 --> 00:22:49,750
Do you know now that I'm ok?

315
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:53,334
We should do it again.

316
00:22:53,584 --> 00:22:56,167
Ready? 1-2-3-4

317
00:22:56,459 --> 00:22:57,042
Tum!

318
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:58,709
- Tum! Help me!
- Som.

319
00:23:00,209 --> 00:23:01,042
Tum!

320
00:23:01,292 --> 00:23:02,750
- Som, what happened?
- Help.

321
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,625
Tum, I saw a pervert.

322
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:06,000
A pervert! Where?

323
00:23:06,542 --> 00:23:07,084
At the library.

324
00:23:07,125 --> 00:23:08,834
He is chasing me.

325
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:11,334
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.

326
00:23:11,709 --> 00:23:12,209
Let's go.

327
00:23:13,042 --> 00:23:14,167
Come on.

328
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,500
We better go hard for someone like him.

329
00:23:19,084 --> 00:23:20,584
Beat the shit out of him.

330
00:23:21,792 --> 00:23:22,500
I yield.

331
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:23,459
Wait, wait.

332
00:23:23,959 --> 00:23:25,250
That's Kong.

333
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:28,542
Wait, that's the boy at my shop.

334
00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:32,292
Wait, for heaven's sake!

335
00:23:32,709 --> 00:23:34,084
Listen up.

336
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,250
He is dying already.

337
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:38,917
Are you ok, Kong?

338
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:44,500
Kong, this is Som...

339
00:23:45,209 --> 00:23:46,125
My friend.

340
00:23:47,042 --> 00:23:48,750
Som, this is Kong. He works at the shop.

341
00:23:53,792 --> 00:23:54,875
You're Som?

342
00:23:59,209 --> 00:23:59,875
Experts said that time traveling can happen

343
00:23:59,917 --> 00:24:03,000
He ran after me. He followed me a long time.
Experts said that time traveling can happen

344
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:04,584
You called him a pervert, he just wants to explain.
When same situations happen over and over in the relative timing.

345
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:07,386
He is a pervert! I'm not.
Then the portal of dimension will be opened.

346
00:24:08,042 --> 00:24:09,292
If so, I won't let him stay with me.

347
00:24:09,334 --> 00:24:10,792
- He really is a pervert.
- Who?

348
00:24:10,834 --> 00:24:12,292
There he is.

349
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:15,584
I told you many times that I'm not.

350
00:24:15,834 --> 00:24:17,042
Do you still not believe?

351
00:24:17,584 --> 00:24:20,500
How could you not be? You were under my skirt?

352
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:22,585
What are you looking at?

353
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:24,334
What do you want from me?

354
00:24:24,875 --> 00:24:25,834
Hey, listen.

355
00:24:26,167 --> 00:24:29,084
I passed out in the phone booth.

356
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:31,214
When I woke up, I was already under your skirt.

357
00:24:31,667 --> 00:24:33,834
Do you think I wanted to see your panties?

358
00:24:35,042 --> 00:24:36,167
What colour?

359
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:37,417
I didn't see.

360
00:24:38,417 --> 00:24:39,542
You didn't wear panties?

361
00:24:40,042 --> 00:24:40,709
Tum!

362
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,875
Come on, you two.

363
00:24:43,125 --> 00:24:44,167
I don't know.

364
00:24:44,875 --> 00:24:47,042
Why did you run after me then?

365
00:24:47,459 --> 00:24:51,709
I was going to ask, I have lost the...

366
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:54,667
What do you call that thing...

367
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:56,375
the thing with the message?

368
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,000
- Is it pager?
- Yeah, pager.

369
00:24:58,459 --> 00:25:01,084
I lost pager in the phone booth.

370
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:03,334
I was going to ask if you saw it.

371
00:25:03,834 --> 00:25:06,084
You lost your stuff, what does it has to do with me?

372
00:25:06,542 --> 00:25:07,209
Pervert.

373
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:07,959
Pervert?

374
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,167
You pervert!

375
00:25:09,209 --> 00:25:11,209
- Som, calm down.
- Calm down.

376
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,125
You still have bruises.

377
00:25:14,459 --> 00:25:15,667
Calm down.

378
00:25:16,125 --> 00:25:17,375
Stop it, you both.

379
00:25:18,625 --> 00:25:20,959
Trust me, Som. Kong is not a pervert.

380
00:25:21,542 --> 00:25:23,750
I guarantee, even though he looks...

381
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,834
a bit off. But he is not a pervert.

382
00:25:26,417 --> 00:25:27,125
Tum.

383
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:28,375
Trust me.

384
00:25:30,542 --> 00:25:31,875
Ok, if you say so.

385
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:33,167
Good.

386
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,375
I said the same, you don't listen.

387
00:25:37,334 --> 00:25:38,125
Hey now.

388
00:25:39,042 --> 00:25:42,042
If there is nothing else, we'll continue rehearsing.

389
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,917
Go home safely.

390
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:47,959
I came here to tell you,
I'll go to see you at the shop on the weekend.

391
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,250
What?

392
00:25:50,875 --> 00:25:52,334
Do you forget the appointment again?

393
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:53,959
About guitar lesson.

394
00:25:54,417 --> 00:25:56,750
Yeah, I forgot.

395
00:25:59,667 --> 00:26:00,375
Is that it?

396
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:02,875
You can text him via Line.

397
00:26:04,459 --> 00:26:05,167
What?

398
00:26:10,084 --> 00:26:10,792
I'm leaving!

399
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:22,375
It's getting dark outside, so scary.

400
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,250
Yeah.

401
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:28,959
It's scary for girls to go home alone late at night.

402
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:03,459
The bus is here, this is ok.

403
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:06,125
Aren't you scared?

404
00:27:11,334 --> 00:27:12,250
Wait, wait

405
00:27:12,542 --> 00:27:13,625
How about pager?

406
00:27:14,792 --> 00:27:15,375
Hey!

407
00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:17,792
Hey!

408
00:27:25,417 --> 00:27:26,834
Come, let me teach you.

409
00:27:27,084 --> 00:27:28,625
Here... Proud.

410
00:27:29,084 --> 00:27:29,875
Take a look.

411
00:27:30,667 --> 00:27:31,584
Barbie.

412
00:27:33,209 --> 00:27:34,042
Y Not Seven.

413
00:27:35,875 --> 00:27:36,750
Modern Dog.

414
00:27:38,542 --> 00:27:39,167
The Must.

415
00:27:40,334 --> 00:27:41,167
You remember now?

416
00:27:41,667 --> 00:27:42,459
Let me ask you.

417
00:27:43,584 --> 00:27:44,417
Who is this?

418
00:27:46,459 --> 00:27:47,542
Pr... Proud?

419
00:27:48,084 --> 00:27:48,964
- Is it right?
- Proud.

420
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:52,084
Correct, which band?

421
00:27:53,459 --> 00:27:54,375
No answer.

422
00:27:55,042 --> 00:27:55,917
Which band?

423
00:27:56,542 --> 00:27:57,709
- Y... -
- Too slow.

424
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:58,500
Bro.

425
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Give me some time.

426
00:28:00,209 --> 00:28:00,959
Which band?

427
00:28:01,292 --> 00:28:01,875
Modern Dog.

428
00:28:02,084 --> 00:28:03,084
Modern Dog, correct.

429
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:04,125
What is this?

430
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:09,334
Bro, I beg you. Gentle, please.

431
00:28:10,917 --> 00:28:11,834
Memorize these.

432
00:28:11,875 --> 00:28:14,209
We sell cassettes downstairs, alright?

433
00:28:14,417 --> 00:28:15,817
Then you'll know who are out there.

434
00:28:27,459 --> 00:28:29,792
1144 Paclink. Can I help you?

435
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:31,459
May I have the number?

437
00:28:33,334 --> 00:28:35,250

438
00:28:35,417 --> 00:28:36,167
Mam.

Mam.

440
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:40,250
Are you still mad at me?

441
00:28:40,875 --> 00:28:43,042
Are you still mad at me?

442
00:28:43,417 --> 00:28:44,917
Can we meet?

443
00:28:45,792 --> 00:28:47,917
Can we meet?

444
00:28:48,334 --> 00:28:49,125
That'd be all.

445
00:28:49,834 --> 00:28:50,875
That'd be all.

446
00:28:52,084 --> 00:28:55,334
Not this one, this part I'm talking to you.

447
00:28:56,917 --> 00:28:57,542
From...

448
00:28:58,042 --> 00:28:58,667
Tum.

449
00:28:58,959 --> 00:29:00,959
Thank you for choosing our service.

450
00:29:04,167 --> 00:29:05,417
Are you done?

451
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:11,000
Hello, this is 1144 Paclink.

452
00:29:11,334 --> 00:29:12,534
May I have the number, please?

453
00:29:12,875 --> 00:29:14,125
993399

454
00:29:14,375 --> 00:29:16,209
993399

455
00:29:16,417 --> 00:29:20,167
Mam, I have to go for audition
with the record company.

456
00:29:20,459 --> 00:29:22,250
Will you come to support me?

457
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,709
No, let me change the message.

458
00:29:25,042 --> 00:29:26,084
I love you, Mam.

459
00:29:26,542 --> 00:29:27,584
I love you so much.

460
00:29:27,917 --> 00:29:29,167
Can I change it again, please?

461
00:29:29,584 --> 00:29:31,834
I still want to be with you.

462
00:29:32,292 --> 00:29:33,750
I miss you so much.

463
00:29:35,542 --> 00:29:36,959
I don't want this part.

464
00:29:39,292 --> 00:29:40,459
Excuse me.

465
00:29:40,667 --> 00:29:43,500
You might want to revise it,
that won't waste your time.

466
00:29:44,209 --> 00:29:46,709
No it doesn't. I have a lot of free time.

467
00:29:48,209 --> 00:29:50,334
Yes, so which part do you want?

468
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,334
Forget it.

469
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:58,417
Thank you for choosing our service.

470
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:01,500
Moron!

471
00:30:01,959 --> 00:30:04,292
So, I can use the phone now?

472
00:30:04,667 --> 00:30:06,042
Uncle, one more time.

473
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,125
Ok, I give you two.

474
00:30:10,459 --> 00:30:10,917
Uncle!

475
00:30:10,959 --> 00:30:11,875
Give me!

476
00:30:12,417 --> 00:30:14,000
Can I call first?

477
00:30:14,209 --> 00:30:16,792
I want to call a gas company, it runs out.

478
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,209
I have been waiting for hours.

479
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:21,042
Get away, let me make a call.

480
00:30:27,167 --> 00:30:30,792
If the sky is out there, you can still see me.

481
00:30:31,959 --> 00:30:35,459
If the sky knows, will you recognise?

482
00:30:36,542 --> 00:30:40,750
You're my ultimate dream.

483
00:30:42,334 --> 00:30:46,542
When the sky is clear, I'm still waiting.

484
00:30:48,042 --> 00:30:49,709
Damn, that's brilliant!

485
00:30:50,792 --> 00:30:53,292
Is it that complicated each time
you send a message?

486
00:30:53,667 --> 00:30:54,417
Yeah.

487
00:30:54,792 --> 00:30:56,167
How is it? Is that good?

488
00:30:58,417 --> 00:30:59,875
Look at the rhyme.

489
00:31:00,667 --> 00:31:01,750
What rhyme?

490
00:31:02,417 --> 00:31:03,667
So tacky.

491
00:31:04,459 --> 00:31:05,375
Why so?

492
00:31:05,625 --> 00:31:07,542
Is this from grandpa's generation?

493
00:31:08,334 --> 00:31:09,375
Are you sure?

494
00:31:12,292 --> 00:31:13,917
Why, is it not touching?

495
00:31:14,334 --> 00:31:16,084
You want it touching? Let me.

496
00:31:20,084 --> 00:31:21,584
May I have the number, please?

497
00:31:21,959 --> 00:31:23,292
993399, please.

498
00:31:24,459 --> 00:31:25,334
My dollface.

499
00:31:25,959 --> 00:31:27,000
My dullface.

500
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:28,584
No, "doll"  face.

501
00:31:28,834 --> 00:31:29,375
Doll?

502
00:31:29,542 --> 00:31:30,625
Doll... doll...

503
00:31:31,375 --> 00:31:32,125
Doll?

504
00:31:32,667 --> 00:31:33,709
Doll, can you spell it?

505
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:36,334
D - o - l - l.

506
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,750
D - o - l - l... yes.

507
00:31:39,917 --> 00:31:41,167
I miss you heaps.

508
00:31:41,959 --> 00:31:43,375
I miss you heaps.

509
00:31:43,875 --> 00:31:45,000
Sheeps, right?

510
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,459
Heaps, please. Heaps.

511
00:31:46,875 --> 00:31:48,834
Heaps, can you spell it, please?

512
00:31:49,334 --> 00:31:52,625
H - e - a - p - s.

513
00:31:54,375 --> 00:31:57,459
Do you miss me?

514
00:31:57,959 --> 00:32:00,959
I miss you loads.

515
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,375
I miss you...

516
00:32:04,792 --> 00:32:05,875
Loads, that is.

517
00:32:06,084 --> 00:32:07,167
Toads?

518
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,375
It's L.

519
00:32:08,584 --> 00:32:10,792
l - o - a - d - s.

520
00:32:10,917 --> 00:32:11,625
What are you reading?

521
00:32:11,667 --> 00:32:12,750
Loads, yes?

522
00:32:12,792 --> 00:32:13,917
Very good.

523
00:32:14,084 --> 00:32:14,917
From Tum.

524
00:32:14,959 --> 00:32:17,709
Yes, "From Tum". Thank you.

525
00:32:20,417 --> 00:32:22,584
Still waiting for Mam's message?

526
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,709
The tide on Chaopraya River is high.

527
00:32:39,459 --> 00:32:41,417
Your love life is going rocket high.

528
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,667
Damn, this is bullshit.

529
00:32:44,709 --> 00:32:46,500
I'll cancel all the service.

530
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,875
Who are you calling?

531
00:32:58,542 --> 00:32:59,709
I'm calling Mam.

532
00:33:07,709 --> 00:33:08,750
Let me get it.

533
00:33:11,084 --> 00:33:14,459
Hello, Kittimanan House, how can I help you?

534
00:33:17,834 --> 00:33:18,542
Shit.

535
00:33:19,917 --> 00:33:20,750
What's wrong?

536
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,917
It's her dad. He is intense.

537
00:33:24,834 --> 00:33:26,625
Grandpa is so kind.

538
00:33:26,917 --> 00:33:28,667
Let me talk.

539
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:31,125
Huh? Whose grandpa?

540
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:32,834
Will you dial?

541
00:33:40,542 --> 00:33:43,667
Hello. Kittimanan House, how can I help you?

542
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:52,917
I told you. He is so intense.

543
00:33:58,042 --> 00:33:58,792
I have an idea.

544
00:34:05,917 --> 00:34:08,750
Kittimanan House, how can I help you?

545
00:34:09,709 --> 00:34:11,750
Err... hello.

546
00:34:12,167 --> 00:34:15,875
This is May. Can I speak to Mam?

547
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:19,000
Oh May, one moment.

548
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,500
Mam, it's May.

549
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:22,334
Yes.

550
00:34:26,584 --> 00:34:27,584
Hello, May?

551
00:34:27,875 --> 00:34:29,500
Hello Mam, this is Tum.

552
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:31,542
Mam, what are you doing?

553
00:34:35,459 --> 00:34:36,750
What's wrong?

554
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,584
It's disconnected.

555
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,375
She hung up on me.

556
00:34:49,709 --> 00:34:50,292
Tum.

557
00:34:51,792 --> 00:34:53,542
Let me ask you something.

558
00:34:54,209 --> 00:34:55,500
Is Som your ex-girlfriend?

559
00:34:56,625 --> 00:34:58,042
Som and I are never together.

560
00:34:58,334 --> 00:34:59,135
Friend with benefit?

561
00:34:59,167 --> 00:34:59,968
Friend with benefit?

562
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:01,084
What friend with benefit?

563
00:35:01,209 --> 00:35:03,750
More than friend but...

564
00:35:05,209 --> 00:35:06,709
not a girlfriend.

565
00:35:07,417 --> 00:35:08,542
We call it "lover"

566
00:35:10,584 --> 00:35:13,125
But Som is not my lover.

567
00:35:13,584 --> 00:35:15,667
Som and I know each other since we were kids.

568
00:35:16,125 --> 00:35:18,709
We are very close, like brother and sister.

569
00:35:19,042 --> 00:35:22,167
I don't understand why Mam is so jealous.

570
00:35:23,875 --> 00:35:25,250
Maybe Mam is jealous...

571
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:27,625
because she knows of something

572
00:35:28,667 --> 00:35:29,709
that Som...

573
00:35:30,875 --> 00:35:32,459
is not thinking of you as a brother.

574
00:35:34,334 --> 00:35:36,294
There is no way Som will think of me differently.

575
00:35:36,584 --> 00:35:37,750
Believe me, Som will...

576
00:35:38,375 --> 00:35:42,334
cause you problems in the future.

577
00:35:45,834 --> 00:35:47,042
You're overthinking.

578
00:35:47,334 --> 00:35:48,334
I'll go to bed now.

579
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:11,709
Colonel Buncha Kittimanan

580
00:36:16,167 --> 00:36:16,834
Bro, bro.

581
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:21,459
Hello

582
00:36:21,584 --> 00:36:22,584
Is Mam here?

583
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,375
Yes, wait here.

584
00:36:24,834 --> 00:36:25,500
Yes.

585
00:36:33,875 --> 00:36:34,709
Hello Mam.

586
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:39,167
I'm Kong, Tum's friend.

587
00:36:39,625 --> 00:36:40,834
Yeah, I know.

588
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,500
How do you know my house?

589
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:45,959
Tum told you?

590
00:36:46,084 --> 00:36:48,375
No, Tum didn't tell me anything.

591
00:36:49,917 --> 00:36:51,084
It's just that I know.

592
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,375
Why are you here? What do you want?

593
00:36:54,625 --> 00:36:56,209
I'm here to talk about Tum.

594
00:36:56,917 --> 00:36:57,542
Well...

595
00:36:58,459 --> 00:36:59,375
Wiat up.

596
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,667
Let me explain.

597
00:37:01,459 --> 00:37:02,380
- You can go now.
- Mam!

598
00:37:03,125 --> 00:37:04,584
I haven't finished.

599
00:37:09,667 --> 00:37:12,042
Does it hurt much? Err...

600
00:37:12,959 --> 00:37:14,084
You have bruises.

601
00:37:14,292 --> 00:37:16,417
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it. Is it hurt?

602
00:37:18,292 --> 00:37:19,500
What are you smiling at?

603
00:37:20,792 --> 00:37:21,459
Nothing.

604
00:37:22,542 --> 00:37:23,250
It just...

605
00:37:24,042 --> 00:37:25,500
You reminds me of my mom.

606
00:37:26,959 --> 00:37:28,042
You're saying I'm old?

607
00:37:28,292 --> 00:37:30,917
No, I'm saying you have same personality.

608
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:33,709
Yeah, whatever.

609
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:36,917
Mam, the thing is...

610
00:37:38,042 --> 00:37:40,375
Tum still loves you very much.

611
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:43,000
Please get back to him.

612
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:47,292
The day we broke up...

613
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:50,875
I told him to stop seeing Som.

614
00:37:51,959 --> 00:37:53,292
He said he couldn't.

615
00:37:54,584 --> 00:37:55,917
So if he couldn't,

616
00:37:57,209 --> 00:37:58,667
I should break up with him.

617
00:38:00,292 --> 00:38:02,709
The one who breaks up should be neither of you.

618
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:05,125
It should be Som.

619
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,917
But it's ok.

620
00:38:07,667 --> 00:38:10,667
I'll make her out of Tum's life.

621
00:38:12,209 --> 00:38:15,375
But Tum's band will go for audition.

622
00:38:16,334 --> 00:38:19,209
You know, it's his dream.

623
00:38:19,667 --> 00:38:21,709
Will you please go to support him?

624
00:38:23,292 --> 00:38:24,084
Please?

625
00:38:36,125 --> 00:38:37,709
Kong, help me here.

626
00:38:44,834 --> 00:38:46,084
Help uncle at the shop ok?

627
00:38:47,375 --> 00:38:49,750
Don't argue with the clients, ok?

628
00:38:50,917 --> 00:38:52,042
Kong!

629
00:38:52,792 --> 00:38:53,709
Are you listening?

630
00:38:58,917 --> 00:38:59,542
Tum.

631
00:39:01,667 --> 00:39:02,750
It's a good day today.

632
00:39:03,459 --> 00:39:05,000
I know you need supports.

633
00:39:05,709 --> 00:39:08,334
And the most important support for you...

634
00:39:08,625 --> 00:39:10,084
is from no one but...

635
00:39:11,042 --> 00:39:12,167
Tum!

636
00:39:18,167 --> 00:39:19,417
Did you bring Som here?

637
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,334
No, I...

638
00:39:24,334 --> 00:39:25,000
Tum.

639
00:39:25,792 --> 00:39:26,750
Please do your best.

640
00:39:26,792 --> 00:39:28,709
Don't forget me when you become famous.

641
00:39:29,042 --> 00:39:30,625
See you later.

642
00:39:31,417 --> 00:39:32,417
Do you best.

643
00:39:32,625 --> 00:39:34,375
Sure, bye.

644
00:39:35,875 --> 00:39:36,709
Tum, are you ready?

645
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:37,459
Let's go.

646
00:39:40,084 --> 00:39:41,375
Do you best.

647
00:39:41,709 --> 00:39:42,875
You're the best.

648
00:39:47,167 --> 00:39:48,292
What are you looking at?

649
00:39:49,125 --> 00:39:51,709
If you only want to say this, you can just call.

650
00:39:52,209 --> 00:39:52,875
You're...

651
00:39:55,667 --> 00:39:56,459
Raeya.

652
00:39:59,417 --> 00:40:00,667
Raeya what?

653
00:40:05,209 --> 00:40:07,042
What's wrong with him?

654
00:40:07,584 --> 00:40:08,667
Raeya?

655
00:40:14,584 --> 00:40:15,334
These 2, please.

656
00:40:15,375 --> 00:40:16,000
Yes.

657
00:40:26,709 --> 00:40:28,125
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

658
00:41:04,042 --> 00:41:05,125
To Tum... Som

659
00:41:09,875 --> 00:41:11,209
Oh shit.

660
00:41:12,959 --> 00:41:15,959
Tum, from now on...

661
00:41:17,375 --> 00:41:19,834
I don't have to fight for the phone anymore.

662
00:41:20,542 --> 00:41:22,625
Uncle, I don't understand.

663
00:41:23,209 --> 00:41:26,042
Why is Som so into Tum?

664
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,917
She knows he has Mam.

665
00:41:28,375 --> 00:41:30,015
Yet she is after him until they broke up.

666
00:41:31,667 --> 00:41:33,292
Som is unfortunate.

667
00:41:33,792 --> 00:41:35,250
She doesn't have much friends.

668
00:41:36,584 --> 00:41:40,125
She was always with her brother every where.

669
00:41:40,709 --> 00:41:43,709
Tum is her brother's best friend.

670
00:41:57,625 --> 00:41:58,750
One day

671
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:01,959
Som's brother died.

672
00:42:05,459 --> 00:42:07,500
She doesn't have anyone to rely on.

673
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:14,667
Tum offered to take care of her since.

674
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:20,250
Kong, seriously...

675
00:42:21,459 --> 00:42:23,875
If you were in his shoes, would you leave her?

676
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:24,917
Yes.

677
00:42:26,834 --> 00:42:27,667
I love Mam.

678
00:42:28,834 --> 00:42:29,834
I'm her team.

679
00:42:32,042 --> 00:42:33,125
Hey, seriously?

680
00:42:33,959 --> 00:42:36,000
Is Mam your mom?

681
00:42:36,417 --> 00:42:38,459
Why do you love her so much?

682
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,750
I tried to convince you so hard,
doesn't help at all.

683
00:42:44,292 --> 00:42:45,917
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

684
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:50,834
- Hey?
- Hey?

685
00:42:52,792 --> 00:42:53,667
Hi Uncle.

686
00:42:53,792 --> 00:42:54,542
Hi.

687
00:42:55,459 --> 00:42:58,125
You're all up here, who takes care of the shop?

688
00:42:58,250 --> 00:42:59,167
It's closed.

689
00:42:59,667 --> 00:43:00,250
Closed?

690
00:43:03,125 --> 00:43:06,375
My sales will go rocket down now.

691
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:14,417
Tum.

692
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:17,000
How was it, did it go well?

693
00:43:17,084 --> 00:43:17,709
Yeah.

694
00:43:19,459 --> 00:43:22,209
What does it mean?

695
00:43:22,959 --> 00:43:23,750
Just yeah.

696
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:26,584
I know now.

697
00:43:28,792 --> 00:43:31,375
Will you help uncle the whole day tomorrow?

698
00:43:32,292 --> 00:43:34,375
Why? Where are you going?

699
00:43:34,875 --> 00:43:36,292
I have to teach guitar to Som.

700
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:41,667
Tum.

701
00:43:42,667 --> 00:43:46,292
Uncle told me all about Som.

702
00:43:47,167 --> 00:43:50,334
Do you know, the more you're good to her,

703
00:43:50,709 --> 00:43:52,000
things will get worse.

704
00:43:54,125 --> 00:43:55,417
And what did she do wrong?

705
00:43:57,375 --> 00:43:58,542
There is nothing wrong

706
00:43:59,542 --> 00:44:03,375
as long as she only think of you as a brother.

707
00:44:08,709 --> 00:44:10,167
If you care for her,

708
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,959
you should let her go.

709
00:44:16,084 --> 00:44:17,334
What do you want me to do?

710
00:44:22,917 --> 00:44:23,667
Som.

711
00:44:24,584 --> 00:44:25,250
Tum.

712
00:44:27,542 --> 00:44:29,917
I have to prepare myself for audition.

713
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,125
I don't have enough time to teach you.

714
00:44:33,667 --> 00:44:34,250
Oh?

715
00:44:34,417 --> 00:44:38,584
But don't worry, I have a replacement.

716
00:44:40,167 --> 00:44:40,917
Who?

717
00:44:50,917 --> 00:44:53,125
Tum! You know how serious I am with this.

718
00:44:53,292 --> 00:44:55,084
I will go to the school contest.

719
00:44:55,459 --> 00:44:57,125
And you let this pervert to teach me.

720
00:44:57,250 --> 00:44:58,875
Does he even play guitar?

721
00:45:15,334 --> 00:45:16,084
How's that?

722
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:17,834
He is a lefty.

723
00:45:18,167 --> 00:45:19,709
Just like Kurt Cobain.

724
00:45:20,709 --> 00:45:22,084
Better than you for sure.

725
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:28,875
Alright, it's going well. I'm leaving.

726
00:45:30,584 --> 00:45:31,250
Tum!

727
00:45:32,917 --> 00:45:33,667
Tum!

728
00:45:44,125 --> 00:45:44,667
Hey...

729
00:45:45,792 --> 00:45:49,125
I won't charge you this time.

730
00:45:50,959 --> 00:45:54,292
I promise I'll help you write
a song as you wanted.

731
00:45:54,834 --> 00:45:56,834
But there is one simple rule.

732
00:45:58,375 --> 00:46:00,167
Until you finish writing the song...

733
00:46:00,667 --> 00:46:03,750
don't contact Tum... at all.

734
00:46:04,875 --> 00:46:06,792
Why do I have to do what you want?

735
00:46:08,917 --> 00:46:10,625
Tum told you, didn't he?

736
00:46:11,375 --> 00:46:13,042
That he needs to focus.

737
00:46:15,084 --> 00:46:16,959
If you really care about him,

738
00:46:19,084 --> 00:46:21,667
I think you should understand.

739
00:46:25,334 --> 00:46:26,042
Fine.

740
00:46:27,084 --> 00:46:30,084
Hey, about that day...

741
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:33,084
that you called me Raeya, what is it?

742
00:46:33,834 --> 00:46:36,459
Raeya is a woman.

743
00:46:37,125 --> 00:46:38,042
Very pretty.

744
00:46:39,125 --> 00:46:39,792
Really?

745
00:46:40,417 --> 00:46:40,959
But bitchy.

746
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:51,584
Kong, sit here.

747
00:46:53,167 --> 00:46:53,917
What's up?

748
00:46:54,959 --> 00:46:56,125
How was the teaching?

749
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,084
It went well.

750
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,042
And...

751
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:09,000
are you sure that she could step away from me?

752
00:47:10,667 --> 00:47:12,542
Don't worry about this.

753
00:47:13,417 --> 00:47:17,292
I think you better worry
about getting back to Mam.

754
00:47:17,917 --> 00:47:19,959
What a woman! It's been a while...

755
00:47:20,375 --> 00:47:21,584
and she is still mad at you.

756
00:47:23,917 --> 00:47:25,500
Don't worry about that.

757
00:47:25,917 --> 00:47:28,250
I have a great plan.

758
00:47:43,375 --> 00:47:44,542
Is it for real?

759
00:47:45,292 --> 00:47:47,542
- That cool.
- Brilliant.

760
00:47:49,875 --> 00:47:50,625
Is it for me?

761
00:47:54,584 --> 00:47:55,542
Flirting Card?

762
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:00,875
Are you trying to chat my friend up?

763
00:48:06,625 --> 00:48:08,209
No Meddling Card

764
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:08,970
What card is that?

765
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:15,375
Chill out, don't hurt him.

766
00:48:15,417 --> 00:48:16,292
That's cute.

767
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:19,459
Flirting Card

768
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:20,667
I don't talk much and I'm interested in you.

769
00:48:20,709 --> 00:48:21,917
I'd like to know you more and become friend.

770
00:48:21,959 --> 00:48:22,750
If you don't mind, just nod...

771
00:48:22,792 --> 00:48:23,417
or smile a little.

772
00:48:23,459 --> 00:48:25,917
Let me flirt with you.

773
00:48:32,959 --> 00:48:35,459
Still remember - Tum

774
00:48:44,417 --> 00:48:46,000
I still remember the day

775
00:48:46,042 --> 00:48:50,959
you told me how you feel.

776
00:48:51,542 --> 00:48:54,209
Said you will only have me.

777
00:48:54,792 --> 00:48:57,917
The first time we have each other,

778
00:48:57,959 --> 00:49:01,792
it's beyond any memory.

779
00:49:02,292 --> 00:49:05,042
It's so hard to forget.

780
00:49:05,667 --> 00:49:09,542
It's more than words

781
00:49:09,917 --> 00:49:14,584
to explain to you.

782
00:49:17,125 --> 00:49:19,000
Hello. Kittimanam House.

783
00:49:19,042 --> 00:49:20,667
How can I help you?

784
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:25,292
It's May. May I speak to Mam?

785
00:49:26,875 --> 00:49:27,750
May.

786
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,667
Are you sick? Your voice sounds husky.

787
00:49:30,709 --> 00:49:31,709
Alright, wait.

788
00:49:32,167 --> 00:49:32,875
Mam.

789
00:49:33,542 --> 00:49:34,167
Mam.

790
00:49:37,417 --> 00:49:38,417
What's up, May?

791
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:39,834
Hello Mam, it's Tum.

792
00:49:40,375 --> 00:49:42,667
Mam, please listen to me. Don't hung up.

793
00:49:43,042 --> 00:49:45,042
I'm sorry about what happened.

794
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,375
Whether you believe me or not...

795
00:49:48,667 --> 00:49:50,125
I just want to tell you...

796
00:49:50,667 --> 00:49:53,000
that I really don't have a feeling for Som.

797
00:49:53,834 --> 00:49:54,834
She is just a sister.

798
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:56,375
The one I love

799
00:49:59,209 --> 00:50:00,709
is only you.

800
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,584
And tomorrow

801
00:50:04,834 --> 00:50:06,584
I'll perform the opening act for Proud.

802
00:50:06,834 --> 00:50:07,959
I'd like you to come.

803
00:50:08,417 --> 00:50:09,250
Is that all?

804
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:11,875
And...

805
00:50:14,292 --> 00:50:16,209
did you listen the tape I gave?

806
00:50:16,542 --> 00:50:18,792
What tape? Why do I have to listen?

807
00:50:19,917 --> 00:50:22,917
Is that all you want to say? Bye.

808
00:50:33,459 --> 00:50:35,542
Is she good? How was it?

809
00:50:35,584 --> 00:50:36,459
Stop.

810
00:50:37,334 --> 00:50:39,625
Shut up. Close the shop.

811
00:50:43,292 --> 00:50:44,209
Yes.

812
00:51:00,459 --> 00:51:02,500
Malay, Malay, Malay

813
00:51:03,375 --> 00:51:04,875
Malay what is it?

814
00:51:05,084 --> 00:51:06,084
Well, it's...

815
00:51:06,375 --> 00:51:07,667
Malay Malay.

816
00:51:07,917 --> 00:51:10,167
Malay Malay...

817
00:51:10,334 --> 00:51:11,167
Still confused?

818
00:51:13,084 --> 00:51:13,959
Let me tell you...

819
00:51:14,334 --> 00:51:17,042
Around my neighbourhood, this is the most popular.

820
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:18,334
Where is your home?

821
00:51:18,625 --> 00:51:20,917
Let me ask you this, haven't you felt...

822
00:51:21,084 --> 00:51:22,792
having someone falling for you or being in love...

823
00:51:22,917 --> 00:51:24,750
or in a serious relationship?

824
00:51:25,875 --> 00:51:26,875
Plenty.

825
00:51:28,709 --> 00:51:31,250
But nothing serious.

826
00:51:31,792 --> 00:51:35,167
There. That's why you suck at writing songs.

827
00:51:35,959 --> 00:51:37,542
You have to feel like...

828
00:51:38,334 --> 00:51:41,000
feeling good about someone and...

829
00:51:45,292 --> 00:51:46,292
secretly falling in love.

830
00:51:53,542 --> 00:51:54,292
If so...

831
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:56,292
I think I have some.

832
00:52:03,834 --> 00:52:05,750
There, that feeling.

833
00:52:05,959 --> 00:52:07,459
Write it, write it now.

834
00:52:09,959 --> 00:52:11,667
I forgot to feed my baby.

835
00:52:12,667 --> 00:52:13,292
What?

836
00:52:13,667 --> 00:52:14,750
You have a baby?

837
00:52:19,375 --> 00:52:24,167
In the cold night, it's still raining.

838
00:52:25,084 --> 00:52:29,917
My tears are falling like the rain.

839
00:52:30,417 --> 00:52:35,292
I want to love. I want good memory.

840
00:52:36,042 --> 00:52:42,542
I need someone to think of me.

841
00:52:53,125 --> 00:52:54,584
- Hey!
- Wait, wait.

842
00:53:03,834 --> 00:53:04,417
Hey.

843
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,584
Why do you come so late?

844
00:53:07,625 --> 00:53:10,417
I can't call you.
Don't you want to have a pager at all?

845
00:53:11,875 --> 00:53:12,635
I don't have money.

846
00:53:13,042 --> 00:53:15,250
Working with uncle, he pays so little.

847
00:53:15,959 --> 00:53:18,084
I'm lucky enough to be able to pay for meals.

848
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:19,792
I figured.

849
00:53:20,292 --> 00:53:22,417
Here is my old one.

850
00:53:22,625 --> 00:53:23,585
I've just got a new one.

851
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,040
You can borrow it for now.

852
00:53:25,125 --> 00:53:26,542
Get it registered yourself.

853
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,125
This is my pager.

854
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:33,000
Ungrateful.

855
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:34,625
I gave it a second ago, now you say it's yours.

856
00:53:34,667 --> 00:53:36,542
Give it back to me now, you don't need it.

857
00:53:38,167 --> 00:53:39,750
Of course I do, thank you.

858
00:53:43,334 --> 00:53:45,167
Don't you find those messages.

859
00:53:45,334 --> 00:53:46,334
I deleted them all.

860
00:53:47,709 --> 00:53:48,459
Deleted them all?

861
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:49,167
Yep.

862
00:53:50,542 --> 00:53:51,834
How can I get home then?

863
00:53:52,209 --> 00:53:54,334
Why do you hurry back? You've just got here.

864
00:53:54,584 --> 00:53:55,750
Where is my song?

865
00:53:56,667 --> 00:53:57,625
Is it Alternative?

866
00:53:57,667 --> 00:53:59,084
Not Altermajibe, huh?

867
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,292
Seriously?

868
00:54:03,125 --> 00:54:04,792
Why does it have to be alternative?

869
00:54:06,334 --> 00:54:07,209
Don't you know it?

870
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,167
I'll take you to a geek tonight.

871
00:54:16,084 --> 00:54:19,084
I actually don't want you to go.

872
00:54:19,584 --> 00:54:22,584
This is so cruel.

873
00:54:23,334 --> 00:54:24,792
I have myself prepared,

874
00:54:24,834 --> 00:54:28,042
but it doesn't get better.

875
00:54:30,459 --> 00:54:33,459
I want to get down on my knees

876
00:54:34,042 --> 00:54:37,042
to beg you. I just have to do.

877
00:54:37,417 --> 00:54:38,625
Hurry up.

878
00:54:38,917 --> 00:54:39,459
Hurry.

879
00:54:42,375 --> 00:54:45,375
Please don't go, I beg you.

880
00:54:52,084 --> 00:54:57,334
Do you know now that I'm ok?

881
00:55:03,917 --> 00:55:05,625
We are TTNK.

882
00:55:05,667 --> 00:55:07,667
Now welcome Proud.

883
00:55:11,959 --> 00:55:13,042
This is awesome.

884
00:55:14,875 --> 00:55:15,500
Som.

885
00:55:15,959 --> 00:55:16,792
You did great.

886
00:55:17,209 --> 00:55:18,459
Let's take a photo.

887
00:55:18,667 --> 00:55:19,209
Come on.

888
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:20,875
Hurry up.

889
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,584
- Hurry.
- Come on.

890
00:55:29,709 --> 00:55:31,917
One, two, three!

891
00:55:37,084 --> 00:55:38,917
Hurry up. Hurry.

892
00:55:39,542 --> 00:55:40,542
Sorry.

893
00:55:41,792 --> 00:55:44,334
Kong, have you seen Mam?

894
00:55:47,209 --> 00:55:48,000
Not at all.

895
00:55:48,667 --> 00:55:49,584
Not at all?

896
00:55:49,709 --> 00:55:51,209
What are you doing? Hurry.

897
00:55:56,792 --> 00:55:59,667
Because I only have you all along.

898
00:55:59,709 --> 00:56:02,875
Never want to find someone to take your place.

899
00:56:02,917 --> 00:56:05,667
Always have you by my side.

900
00:56:05,709 --> 00:56:09,167
The world is beautiful when we are together.

901
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:17,917
Because we are strong

902
00:56:17,959 --> 00:56:21,292
never fool ourselves in our relationship.

903
00:56:21,334 --> 00:56:24,042
We will always be honest.

904
00:56:24,084 --> 00:56:27,542
Never get distracted because we are strong.

905
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:38,750
We will always look for happiness.

906
00:56:39,417 --> 00:56:44,584
If any of us walks to the wrong path.

907
00:56:45,584 --> 00:56:50,459
There are the sayings

908
00:56:51,542 --> 00:56:55,125
that love always hurts.

909
00:56:55,167 --> 00:56:58,000
Try to remember.

910
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:09,125
You're the dream in my mind.

911
00:57:09,542 --> 00:57:12,542
Just a dream.

912
00:57:13,209 --> 00:57:16,917
This is alternative, the new choice of music.

913
00:57:19,709 --> 00:57:22,709
But I think, in not so many years...

914
00:57:23,125 --> 00:57:24,250
It will be gone.

915
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:28,250
If it's gone, what will you say?

916
00:57:29,292 --> 00:57:30,417
Nothing really.

917
00:57:30,917 --> 00:57:34,542
At least, this is my good memory.

918
00:57:36,292 --> 00:57:37,375
Won't you regret?

919
00:57:38,625 --> 00:57:41,000
No, I rather spend my time to regret

920
00:57:41,334 --> 00:57:43,584
to remember the good memory here.

921
00:57:44,417 --> 00:57:50,417
If only you understand,

922
00:57:50,959 --> 00:57:56,125
I am confident that one day.

923
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:03,209
I will try to find the answer.

924
00:58:03,792 --> 00:58:10,125
My dream will come true.

925
00:58:11,292 --> 00:58:16,042
I will have the love for you,

926
00:58:16,625 --> 00:58:22,625
Like others can't.

927
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:30,792
Only if I have you.

928
00:59:02,792 --> 00:59:03,959
Hey Kong.

929
00:59:04,375 --> 00:59:07,084
What are you doing so loud?

930
00:59:07,459 --> 00:59:09,459
My phone will be broken.

931
00:59:10,167 --> 00:59:11,125
I'm sorry.

932
00:59:12,125 --> 00:59:13,459
I want to send a text.

933
00:59:13,709 --> 00:59:15,375
But I don't know what to say.

934
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:21,209
It's in your heart.

935
00:59:21,959 --> 00:59:26,584
Send whatever you are thinking.

936
00:59:27,834 --> 00:59:31,709
I shouldn't have to teach you this.

937
00:59:33,459 --> 00:59:36,959
Don't you know,
it's 3 baht every time you hang up.

938
00:59:37,417 --> 00:59:39,875
3 times, 9 baht.

939
00:59:41,459 --> 00:59:46,792
This month's bill must be 603 Baht.

940
00:59:54,334 --> 00:59:56,750
1144 Paclink. Can I help you?

941
00:59:57,459 --> 00:59:58,459

00:59:59,667 --> 01:00:01,250

May I have the message?

947
01:00:18,084 --> 01:00:18,834
Som...

948
01:00:19,917 --> 01:00:20,459
Som.

949
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:22,875
Today, you were great.

950
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,584
Today, you were great.

951
01:00:26,417 --> 01:00:27,125
Thank you.

952
01:00:27,417 --> 01:00:28,542
Thank you.

953
01:00:30,417 --> 01:00:31,250
That'd be all.

954
01:00:32,042 --> 01:00:33,875
That'd be all. From?

955
01:00:34,542 --> 01:00:35,250
From Kong.

956
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:36,375
From Kong.

957
01:00:36,667 --> 01:00:38,167
Thank you for choosing our service.

958
01:00:52,959 --> 01:00:56,125
That was frigging sick. Nite-nite. Som

959
01:01:01,209 --> 01:01:02,500
Frigging sick

960
01:01:03,292 --> 01:01:04,084
Sick What's that?

961
01:01:04,125 --> 01:01:04,792
Nothing.

962
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:08,334
Then why are you smiling?

963
01:01:09,792 --> 01:01:10,459
Smiling what?

964
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:12,750
I'm not.

965
01:01:13,834 --> 01:01:15,917
Why are you smiling?

966
01:01:16,959 --> 01:01:19,334
Adult's matter, bugger off.

967
01:01:20,042 --> 01:01:21,167
I better go to bed.

968
01:01:22,084 --> 01:01:23,625
Won't you go to sleep?

969
01:01:25,334 --> 01:01:26,709
You can go upstairs.

970
01:01:27,209 --> 01:01:29,625
It's ok, I can sleep here.

971
01:01:30,125 --> 01:01:31,209
Suit yourself.

972
01:01:48,209 --> 01:01:52,375
Typhoon warning, The capital will be hit

973
01:02:08,125 --> 01:02:12,375
How could you understand

974
01:02:12,709 --> 01:02:14,875
that we get along,

975
01:02:14,917 --> 01:02:16,750
understand and trust each other.

976
01:02:16,834 --> 01:02:19,834
How is it going with song writing?
From the beautiful Som.

977
01:02:20,917 --> 01:02:21,750
Let me read it.

978
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:22,500
Read what?

979
01:02:22,667 --> 01:02:23,334
Come on.

980
01:02:24,959 --> 01:02:26,000
That's Som, right?

981
01:02:26,750 --> 01:02:28,125
Today Showing - Romantic Blue

982
01:02:30,459 --> 01:02:31,459
What are you watching?

983
01:02:31,667 --> 01:02:32,334
Nothing.

984
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:35,292
Whose picture?

985
01:02:35,417 --> 01:02:38,667
The feeling I have for you,

986
01:02:39,542 --> 01:02:42,667
I don't know how good it is.

987
01:02:43,709 --> 01:02:47,625
But the answer you gave me

988
01:02:48,125 --> 01:02:52,084
is that we can't be together.

989
01:02:53,125 --> 01:02:57,292
I has been hurting me all along.

990
01:02:59,625 --> 01:03:01,542
From the beautiful Som.

991
01:03:09,459 --> 01:03:10,209
Hey!

992
01:03:10,542 --> 01:03:11,709
Let me kill someone first.

993
01:03:13,875 --> 01:03:14,676
Fire in the kitchen.

994
01:03:14,792 --> 01:03:17,209
Oh fire, I have to go.

995
01:03:33,792 --> 01:03:36,792
You are a dead man, Fire, huh?

996
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:06,542
It's crowded in there.

997
01:04:06,917 --> 01:04:08,038
Whose birthday is it, uncle?

998
01:04:08,542 --> 01:04:10,000
Yes, birthday.

999
01:04:10,917 --> 01:04:14,209
But it hasn't been born yet, 7 more months.

1000
01:04:15,875 --> 01:04:16,556
You are pregnant?

1001
01:04:18,167 --> 01:04:20,417
How many months? Is it due date soon?

1002
01:04:20,459 --> 01:04:21,917
Pregnant my ass.

1003
01:04:22,625 --> 01:04:24,250
I'm not pregnant.

1004
01:04:26,125 --> 01:04:27,042
Who then?

1005
01:04:31,375 --> 01:04:32,250
Mam is pregnant?

1006
01:04:32,334 --> 01:04:35,042
Why are you shouting? Damn it.

1007
01:04:36,750 --> 01:04:38,042
It's getting intense here.

1008
01:04:38,209 --> 01:04:40,667
You come sit here. Over here.

1009
01:04:41,125 --> 01:04:42,959
Stay still and do nothing.

1010
01:04:43,125 --> 01:04:44,792
Let the adults discuss the issue.

1011
01:05:05,125 --> 01:05:06,834
Date of Birth: 16 Feb 1996

1012
01:05:10,375 --> 01:05:11,417
Shit!

1013
01:05:17,709 --> 01:05:18,417
Dad.

1014
01:05:18,792 --> 01:05:19,709
Who is your dad?

1015
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:22,584
Colonel then.

1016
01:05:23,667 --> 01:05:27,834
I won't let my girl's future ruin because of him.

1017
01:05:31,459 --> 01:05:32,500
But colonel...

1018
01:05:33,042 --> 01:05:34,959
For the moment...

1019
01:05:35,584 --> 01:05:37,542
Mam is already pregnant.

1020
01:05:37,834 --> 01:05:39,125
Then get the abortion!

1021
01:05:39,750 --> 01:05:41,292
Wait, wait, wait.

1022
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,542
I don't think it's a good idea.

1023
01:05:43,917 --> 01:05:46,500
The baby must fee sorry if it gets to know.

1024
01:05:46,917 --> 01:05:48,667
Shut up, stay right there.

1025
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:49,792
Sorry about what?

1026
01:05:50,542 --> 01:05:53,792
It's only 2 months, it doesn't even have ears.

1027
01:05:54,209 --> 01:05:56,167
It's human, not an eel.

1028
01:05:58,292 --> 01:06:00,917
Dad, please. I beg you.

1029
01:06:02,459 --> 01:06:04,625
I know what Mam and I did is wrong.

1030
01:06:05,709 --> 01:06:07,375
But I really love Mam.

1031
01:06:10,417 --> 01:06:12,667
I am ready to fix the problem.

1032
01:06:14,709 --> 01:06:16,167
I will be graduated soon.

1033
01:06:16,209 --> 01:06:17,750
And I will find a job.

1034
01:06:19,459 --> 01:06:21,000
I will take care of Mam and the baby.

1035
01:06:22,167 --> 01:06:23,375
I don't believe that

1036
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:28,792
someone like you can take care of them.

1037
01:06:33,125 --> 01:06:34,834
But I believe in Tum.

1038
01:06:36,542 --> 01:06:37,334
Huh?

1039
01:06:43,959 --> 01:06:45,209
And by the way,

1040
01:06:47,209 --> 01:06:49,959
this is my baby, not yours.

1041
01:07:08,667 --> 01:07:09,750
Thank you, Mam.

1042
01:07:18,292 --> 01:07:19,667
Take care of yourself.

1043
01:07:21,292 --> 01:07:22,667
I hope you become famous.

1044
01:07:25,417 --> 01:07:26,792
Good luck.

1045
01:07:43,417 --> 01:07:45,834
Do you really quit the band?

1046
01:07:47,542 --> 01:07:49,000
I already quit.

1047
01:07:50,875 --> 01:07:52,625
You said this is your dream.

1048
01:07:56,792 --> 01:07:58,334
When I know I have a baby,

1049
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:04,042
I think my dream has been changed.

1050
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:10,667
In that dream, there is not only myself.

1051
01:08:11,959 --> 01:08:13,334
But there are 3 of us.

1052
01:08:16,625 --> 01:08:18,834
I don't want Mam and my baby to struggle.

1053
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:23,542
I will take care of them.

1054
01:08:36,459 --> 01:08:37,709
Why are you crying?

1055
01:08:41,584 --> 01:08:44,459
Your baby is very lucky.

1056
01:08:47,084 --> 01:08:48,500
You are quite sensitive, huh?

1057
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,667
Don't forget to meet me at the cinema. Som.

1058
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:08,959
Som, huh?

1059
01:09:11,459 --> 01:09:12,917
What's with you guys?

1060
01:09:14,417 --> 01:09:15,334
Nothing between us.

1061
01:09:16,625 --> 01:09:18,500
Maybe about the song.

1062
01:09:19,417 --> 01:09:21,042
About the song?

1063
01:09:23,125 --> 01:09:24,334
Love song, maybe?

1064
01:09:26,292 --> 01:09:29,292
You just tell her you love her, alright?

1065
01:09:41,792 --> 01:09:42,792
So you want to see me?

1066
01:09:45,709 --> 01:09:47,042
I just want to tell you...

1067
01:09:47,542 --> 01:09:51,000
thank you for teaching me guitar
and writing the song.

1068
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:53,792
Umm.

1069
01:09:55,209 --> 01:09:55,792
Umm.

1070
01:09:59,125 --> 01:10:00,000
Is that all?

1071
01:10:00,750 --> 01:10:01,292
Yep.

1072
01:10:03,334 --> 01:10:05,042
You can just send me the message.

1073
01:10:08,084 --> 01:10:09,250
Let me ask you something,

1074
01:10:10,334 --> 01:10:13,334
Why don't you use telephone or send messages?

1075
01:10:14,459 --> 01:10:16,542
You make an appointment just to say one sentence?

1076
01:10:17,417 --> 01:10:18,292
Are you not tired?

1077
01:10:19,792 --> 01:10:23,375
No, I think the message can't explain everything.

1078
01:10:23,750 --> 01:10:25,167
I prefer to talk face to face.

1079
01:10:27,917 --> 01:10:29,084
What's the difference?

1080
01:10:29,875 --> 01:10:33,084
Well, the texts can fool us.

1081
01:10:33,584 --> 01:10:35,375
But the eyes...

1082
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:37,834
cannot lie.

1083
01:10:39,125 --> 01:10:40,500
Let me see how you feel.

1084
01:10:45,292 --> 01:10:45,792
Boo!

1085
01:10:47,209 --> 01:10:48,209
Nutter!

1086
01:10:50,250 --> 01:10:52,625
Since you are out today,

1087
01:10:52,917 --> 01:10:55,750
Let's take photo sticker, as a souvenir.

1088
01:10:56,167 --> 01:10:56,750
Go.

1089
01:10:57,750 --> 01:10:59,875
Yeah, photo sticker. Come on.

1090
01:11:02,375 --> 01:11:04,125
Photo sticker machine still exists?

1091
01:11:04,334 --> 01:11:05,500
This is brand new!

1092
01:11:05,875 --> 01:11:08,500
You country boy, never know it huh?

1093
01:11:09,250 --> 01:11:09,917
Excuse me.

1094
01:11:11,084 --> 01:11:12,625
- You have 12 acts.
- Yes.

1095
01:11:12,667 --> 01:11:14,459
One, two, three!

1096
01:11:24,209 --> 01:11:25,042
Hey!

1097
01:11:28,917 --> 01:11:30,542
Look at this shot.

1098
01:11:31,667 --> 01:11:32,334
Whoa.

1099
01:11:33,042 --> 01:11:34,167
Whoa.

1100
01:11:35,334 --> 01:11:36,292
You are too slow.

1101
01:11:37,334 --> 01:11:38,125
Here.

1102
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,875
These are mines, those are yours.

1103
01:11:44,375 --> 01:11:46,000
What should I do with them?

1104
01:11:47,667 --> 01:11:49,292
Put them in sticker book.

1105
01:11:51,625 --> 01:11:52,375
You don't have?

1106
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:54,959
Well then...

1107
01:11:55,959 --> 01:11:57,334
put them on your pager. Hold this.

1108
01:11:59,917 --> 01:12:01,084
You've never done this, huh?

1109
01:12:05,417 --> 01:12:06,084
Here.

1110
01:12:07,375 --> 01:12:08,584
Give them back to me.

1111
01:12:14,459 --> 01:12:15,125
Kong.

1112
01:12:16,709 --> 01:12:17,625
What's up?

1113
01:12:18,084 --> 01:12:19,250
Can I ask you one thing?

1114
01:12:21,750 --> 01:12:23,750
I'll be attending musical contest tomorrow.

1115
01:12:24,167 --> 01:12:26,459
Will you bring Tum there to support?

1116
01:12:29,084 --> 01:12:30,625
Why do you need Tum there?

1117
01:12:31,542 --> 01:12:33,375
I keep my promise.

1118
01:12:33,417 --> 01:12:36,417
I finish writing the song, I can see him now.

1119
01:12:40,250 --> 01:12:43,250
Tum will keep his promise.

1120
01:12:45,084 --> 01:12:46,792
Huh? Promise?

1121
01:12:49,209 --> 01:12:53,792
Well, Tum promised me...

1122
01:12:54,709 --> 01:12:58,667
if I can be good like you and I win,

1123
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:00,834
can I ask you something?

1124
01:13:01,917 --> 01:13:02,834
What will you ask for?

1125
01:13:03,959 --> 01:13:05,280
You will have to be my boyfriend.

1126
01:13:06,542 --> 01:13:07,459
Is it ok?

1127
01:13:09,625 --> 01:13:10,375
How about...

1128
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:14,167
go to the contests and win something.

1129
01:13:15,292 --> 01:13:18,959
I'll think about it.

1130
01:13:19,625 --> 01:13:22,042
He will be my boyfriend.

1131
01:13:22,959 --> 01:13:24,792
I will get to be his girlfriend, Kong.

1132
01:13:27,459 --> 01:13:28,000
Som.

1133
01:13:28,750 --> 01:13:29,334
Well...

1134
01:13:30,750 --> 01:13:31,584
I have something to tell you.

1135
01:13:31,625 --> 01:13:32,125
Wait.

1136
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,125
One moment.

1137
01:13:40,292 --> 01:13:41,292
My friends need me at the rehearsal.

1138
01:13:41,334 --> 01:13:42,625
I'll see you later.

1139
01:13:42,709 --> 01:13:43,542
Wait, wait.

1140
01:13:44,625 --> 01:13:46,292
I'd like to talk to you first.

1141
01:13:46,875 --> 01:13:48,209
Sure, hold this then.

1142
01:13:48,375 --> 01:13:49,500
Here.

1143
01:13:50,875 --> 01:13:51,917
Give me your hand.

1144
01:13:55,375 --> 01:13:57,042
This is my number, call me.

1145
01:14:02,209 --> 01:14:04,459
Take that back. See ya.

1146
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:25,209
Call me back 9482092

1147
01:14:46,459 --> 01:14:48,334
9482092

1148
01:15:23,292 --> 01:15:26,500
Don't forget to bring Tum along tomorrow. Som.

1149
01:15:32,042 --> 01:15:32,875
Alright.

1150
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:35,917
We have come to the last band tonight.

1151
01:15:36,125 --> 01:15:39,125
Please welcome "Purr".

1152
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:53,792
Hello. We are "Purr".

1153
01:15:55,709 --> 01:15:57,584
Before we get started,

1154
01:16:00,250 --> 01:16:02,250
I'd like to thank a friend of mine...

1155
01:16:04,375 --> 01:16:06,667
who helped me write this song.

1156
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,542
And I'd like to thank my brother,

1157
01:16:11,667 --> 01:16:13,584
I don't know if he is here tonight.

1158
01:16:14,209 --> 01:16:16,459
But I believe that he will come.

1159
01:16:17,084 --> 01:16:19,125
I'd like to tell him that...

1160
01:16:20,167 --> 01:16:22,292
You are the one that changes me.

1161
01:16:23,042 --> 01:16:25,209
I'm here because of you.

1162
01:16:57,875 --> 01:17:02,125
Looking for an answer of what love is

1163
01:17:02,167 --> 01:17:07,875
from every words and letters.

1164
01:17:08,834 --> 01:17:11,209
Look into the songs

1165
01:17:11,250 --> 01:17:15,875
and listen in every melody and lyrics

1166
01:17:15,917 --> 01:17:19,417
but still don't understand.

1167
01:17:20,459 --> 01:17:25,959
Tens of thousands of messages, theories,

1168
01:17:26,459 --> 01:17:30,667
or meanings can never be touching.

1169
01:17:31,584 --> 01:17:36,959
Through the time until I met you,

1170
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:42,292
until I have found the way
to explain better than words.

1171
01:17:42,709 --> 01:17:48,125
You make me realise,
love can be told through the eyes.

1172
01:17:48,625 --> 01:17:53,584
There is no need for more explanation.

1173
01:17:54,292 --> 01:18:00,417
Only a glimpse from you, I can feel the answer

1174
01:18:00,875 --> 01:18:05,500
what love really is.

1175
01:18:16,375 --> 01:18:21,542
Through the time until I met you,

1176
01:18:22,167 --> 01:18:26,750
until I have found the way
to explain better than words.

1177
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:32,959
You make me realise,
love can be told through the eyes.

1178
01:18:33,334 --> 01:18:38,459
There is no need for more explanation.

1179
01:18:38,917 --> 01:18:45,292
Only a glimpse from you, I can feel the answer

1180
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:49,584
what love really is.

1181
01:18:49,709 --> 01:18:55,209
When you know that love
can be told through the eyes.

1182
01:18:55,709 --> 01:19:00,542
There is no need for more explanation.

1183
01:19:00,959 --> 01:19:02,875
When you look into my eyes,

1184
01:19:02,917 --> 01:19:07,500
you'll know I have something...

1185
01:19:07,875 --> 01:19:13,417
that my eyes are telling you.

1186
01:19:25,542 --> 01:19:27,375
Yes! We won!

1187
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:31,125
You girls are so good.

1188
01:19:34,334 --> 01:19:34,959
Kong!

1189
01:19:35,750 --> 01:19:38,209
Wait, wait. Don't you stay to celebrate with us?

1190
01:19:38,292 --> 01:19:40,125
I can't stay. Let go.

1191
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:42,125
Kong, I made it.

1192
01:19:42,167 --> 01:19:43,917
I did it. I just did it.

1193
01:19:44,542 --> 01:19:46,125
And Tum? Where is he?

1194
01:19:46,167 --> 01:19:47,334
I didn't see him.

1195
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:50,125
He got caught up with something...

1196
01:19:50,750 --> 01:19:51,917
He couldn't make it.

1197
01:19:55,459 --> 01:19:57,750
It's ok, I'll tell him myself.

1198
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:08,584
Tum.

1199
01:20:09,459 --> 01:20:10,000
Tum.

1200
01:20:12,084 --> 01:20:12,667
Tum.

1201
01:20:16,542 --> 01:20:17,292
Som.

1202
01:20:17,750 --> 01:20:19,292
You didn't go.

1203
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:22,500
But it's ok.

1204
01:20:23,584 --> 01:20:25,459
I brought you the award.

1205
01:20:27,667 --> 01:20:28,500
And...

1206
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,667
Where is my award?

1207
01:20:32,375 --> 01:20:33,834
Award?

1208
01:20:34,042 --> 01:20:34,667
Som.

1209
01:20:37,292 --> 01:20:39,709
Don't you remember?

1210
01:20:40,250 --> 01:20:41,667
You promised me that

1211
01:20:42,459 --> 01:20:44,709
If I can be good like you one day,

1212
01:20:45,542 --> 01:20:47,292
you will start dating me.

1213
01:20:48,834 --> 01:20:50,417
I made it, Tum.

1214
01:20:51,875 --> 01:20:53,709
I made it because...

1215
01:20:54,584 --> 01:20:55,834
I love you.

1216
01:20:56,792 --> 01:20:58,375
I have loved you a long time.

1217
01:21:00,792 --> 01:21:02,000
I'm so happy.

1218
01:21:04,542 --> 01:21:05,334
Som.

1219
01:21:06,167 --> 01:21:06,875
Well...

1220
01:21:08,375 --> 01:21:09,584
Listen to me.

1221
01:21:10,417 --> 01:21:11,667
Here is the thing...

1222
01:21:13,625 --> 01:21:16,167
I'm about to get married with Mam.

1223
01:21:29,125 --> 01:21:30,417
I'm sorry, Som.

1224
01:21:32,375 --> 01:21:34,750
I can't love you more than a sister.

1225
01:21:54,209 --> 01:22:03,125
I know how you are feeling.

1226
01:22:05,209 --> 01:22:14,250
I can kind of see it.

1227
01:22:15,167 --> 01:22:21,125
But I want to tell you that I don't love you

1228
01:22:21,167 --> 01:22:26,167
and I will never change my mind.

1229
01:22:26,709 --> 01:22:31,917
That might make you disappointed and sad.

1230
01:22:31,959 --> 01:22:38,500
But it's better than letting you wait.

1231
01:22:38,875 --> 01:22:42,167
I don't want you to get the hope up

1232
01:22:43,917 --> 01:22:49,792
because I have been there.

1233
01:22:50,209 --> 01:22:57,542
I don't want you to go into deep.

1234
01:22:57,584 --> 01:23:00,542
It could be too late,

1235
01:23:00,584 --> 01:23:05,917
and you won't be able to forget.

1236
01:23:09,667 --> 01:23:16,875
Cry... cry only today.

1237
01:23:20,917 --> 01:23:29,167
Forget... and let everything be gone.

1238
01:23:31,167 --> 01:23:36,542
Keep your feeling for someone who loves you

1239
01:23:36,584 --> 01:23:42,125
Don't dedicate yourself for nothing.

1240
01:23:42,417 --> 01:23:47,625
You only need to cry now

1241
01:23:48,084 --> 01:23:54,709
and time will help you forget.

1242
01:24:01,750 --> 01:24:03,209
When I was with Tum,

1243
01:24:06,459 --> 01:24:08,834
I always have faith

1244
01:24:11,125 --> 01:24:13,334
that one day I can be with him.

1245
01:24:16,417 --> 01:24:18,667
When Tum started dating Mam,

1246
01:24:21,292 --> 01:24:23,209
I was always certain

1247
01:24:24,834 --> 01:24:26,959
that they'll break up one day.

1248
01:24:27,334 --> 01:24:29,792
And the one that gets to stand next to him...

1249
01:24:32,584 --> 01:24:33,959
is me.

1250
01:24:37,292 --> 01:24:39,375
I never gave up.

1251
01:24:42,334 --> 01:24:46,959
But I have to give up. Now I lost.

1252
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,667
Do you remember that day,

1253
01:24:57,959 --> 01:24:59,709
you brought me to the concert?

1254
01:25:01,667 --> 01:25:03,209
And you told me,

1255
01:25:03,875 --> 01:25:06,875
even though there is no more alternative,

1256
01:25:07,959 --> 01:25:09,125
it's not important.

1257
01:25:10,709 --> 01:25:12,084
Because...

1258
01:25:12,875 --> 01:25:15,250
there is still good memory for us.

1259
01:25:17,167 --> 01:25:18,792
Of course you can say it.

1260
01:25:20,042 --> 01:25:21,834
You have never been in love.

1261
01:25:37,667 --> 01:25:38,792
Look into my eyes.

1262
01:25:40,167 --> 01:25:43,167
And you'll know how I feel.

1263
01:25:52,292 --> 01:25:56,000
I don't want you to get the hope up

1264
01:25:57,584 --> 01:26:02,375
because I have been there.

1265
01:26:03,792 --> 01:26:10,959
I don't want you to go into deep.

1266
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:14,000
It could be too late,

1267
01:26:14,084 --> 01:26:17,125
and you won't be able to forget.

1268
01:27:25,584 --> 01:27:27,000
1144 Paclink.

1269
01:27:27,042 --> 01:27:29,084
May I have the number, please?

1270
01:27:33,834 --> 01:27:36,667
539... 926

1271
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,584
539... 926

1272
01:27:48,709 --> 01:27:51,250
Call me back 9482092

1273
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:53,500
Som.

1274
01:28:33,459 --> 01:28:34,834
- What's wrong?
- Bro.

1275
01:28:34,875 --> 01:28:37,875
- Is he dead?
- He is so still.

1276
01:28:38,417 --> 01:28:41,417
Call someone, the rescue unit or whatever.

1277
01:28:42,250 --> 01:28:44,417
Try tapping him?

1278
01:28:45,084 --> 01:28:45,917
Kong!

1279
01:28:46,375 --> 01:28:47,084
Kong!

1280
01:28:47,417 --> 01:28:48,459
Kong!

1281
01:28:48,750 --> 01:28:51,292
- Kong, are you ok?
- Are you alright, son?

1282
01:28:51,959 --> 01:28:52,625
Kong!

1283
01:28:53,334 --> 01:28:54,375
Kong!

1284
01:28:54,584 --> 01:28:55,959
Are you alright, son?

1285
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:56,792
Kong.

1286
01:28:57,667 --> 01:28:58,917
Kong.

1287
01:28:59,375 --> 01:29:01,459
Kong, are you ok?

1288
01:29:43,625 --> 01:29:44,334
Dad.

1289
01:29:46,625 --> 01:29:47,292
Kong.

1290
01:29:48,667 --> 01:29:50,167
You worked late again last night?

1291
01:29:51,625 --> 01:29:54,000
You are sick, why don't you go to bed?

1292
01:29:54,667 --> 01:29:55,459
Dad...

1293
01:29:57,709 --> 01:29:58,625
Thank you.

1294
01:30:02,709 --> 01:30:03,709
Thank you for what?

1295
01:30:04,667 --> 01:30:07,917
For everything you have done for me.

1296
01:30:08,875 --> 01:30:09,667
And for mom.

1297
01:30:13,959 --> 01:30:16,292
And I want to apologise

1298
01:30:17,292 --> 01:30:20,084
that I get you wrong...

1299
01:30:20,834 --> 01:30:21,584
about Som.

1300
01:30:25,167 --> 01:30:25,959
Kong.

1301
01:30:27,292 --> 01:30:29,834
You don't have to worry about her.

1302
01:30:31,084 --> 01:30:32,917
She won't mess with our family.

1303
01:30:33,334 --> 01:30:34,250
Because...

1304
01:30:38,875 --> 01:30:40,417
She is dead.

1305
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:42,667
What?

1306
01:30:43,542 --> 01:30:45,792
She died on my wedding day.

1307
01:30:47,750 --> 01:30:51,625
She was going to live with her mom in Chiang Mai.

1308
01:30:52,709 --> 01:30:55,500
She mightn't take it that we are getting married.

1309
01:30:59,209 --> 01:31:00,667
Who would have thought...

1310
01:31:02,709 --> 01:31:04,917
that it was the last day I saw her.

1311
01:31:07,459 --> 01:31:09,125
If I asked her to stay

1312
01:31:11,542 --> 01:31:13,250
she wouldn't have been dead.

1313
01:31:17,625 --> 01:31:19,959
Truck crashed into a Bangkok - Chiang Mai bus

1314
01:31:21,959 --> 01:31:22,542
Kong?

1315
01:31:23,042 --> 01:31:23,625
Kong?

1316
01:31:23,792 --> 01:31:24,375
Som!

1317
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:26,000
Kong!

1318
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:39,209
I'll show you push ups.

1319
01:31:42,542 --> 01:31:43,500
Punch here. Punch.

1320
01:31:43,584 --> 01:31:44,209
Bro.

1321
01:31:44,459 --> 01:31:45,625
Where is the phone booth?

1322
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:47,292
The authority took it away.

1323
01:31:47,667 --> 01:31:48,750
Which way did they go?

1324
01:31:49,084 --> 01:31:50,334
They go to many places.

1325
01:31:51,709 --> 01:31:52,417
Where?

1326
01:31:52,792 --> 01:31:55,792
They go to Thaewet, Bang Po, Bukkalo,

1327
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,209
Bang Ping, Merry King, Saphan Kwai,

1328
01:31:58,250 --> 01:31:59,625
Kiak Kai, Odien,

1329
01:31:59,667 --> 01:32:01,042
Bang Khun Thien, Wong Wien Yai,

1330
01:32:01,084 --> 01:32:02,125
Saphan Mai...

1331
01:32:03,292 --> 01:32:04,625
Don Muang... he's gone.

1332
01:32:05,292 --> 01:32:06,292
Thief!

1333
01:32:06,584 --> 01:32:08,125
- Go after him.
- Go, go.

1334
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:13,167
Alright, guys! Whoosh up!

1335
01:32:44,125 --> 01:32:44,667
Hey!

1336
01:32:46,375 --> 01:32:47,417
You dipshit.

1337
01:32:47,709 --> 01:32:48,417
Dumbass.

1338
01:32:49,042 --> 01:32:50,375
Moron, douchebag.

1339
01:32:50,792 --> 01:32:51,959
- Curse him.
- You caught me off guard.

1340
01:32:52,167 --> 01:32:53,917
You little piece of shit.

1341
01:32:54,625 --> 01:32:56,305
I thought they came to seize my motorbike.

1342
01:32:56,334 --> 01:32:57,625
I didn't steal it.

1343
01:32:57,917 --> 01:32:58,750
I just borrow it.

1344
01:32:58,917 --> 01:33:01,667
Borrow? Or did he just borrow?

1345
01:33:01,917 --> 01:33:03,625
Let's go then. He'll bring it back.

1346
01:33:04,084 --> 01:33:05,000
He'll take it back...

1347
01:33:05,709 --> 01:33:07,167
You think it's that easy?

1348
01:33:07,375 --> 01:33:08,584
You obviously stole it.

1349
01:33:08,875 --> 01:33:10,417
We have to chase after you.

1350
01:33:10,459 --> 01:33:13,000
This is our enemy's area, we'll get in troubles.

1351
01:33:13,334 --> 01:33:14,125
I beg you.

1352
01:33:14,375 --> 01:33:16,459
If you want a fight, can we do it later?

1353
01:33:16,709 --> 01:33:18,625
I don't know later, I only know hater.

1354
01:33:18,667 --> 01:33:20,334
Why, why later?

1355
01:33:20,625 --> 01:33:22,542
Is there a reason? Speak now.

1356
01:33:22,917 --> 01:33:24,084
If it makes sense, I'll let you go.

1357
01:33:24,292 --> 01:33:26,334
Otherwise I'll beat you into rice porridge.

1358
01:33:26,459 --> 01:33:27,459
Add 2 eggs in it for me.

1359
01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:28,250
No ginger.

1360
01:33:28,542 --> 01:33:29,084
Damn it!

1361
01:33:29,834 --> 01:33:31,667
You guys only think of food, shut up.

1362
01:33:34,959 --> 01:33:37,084
I know you won't believe me.

1363
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:40,042
But I really need that phone booth
to travel back in time.

1364
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:47,000
It's like a portal of dimension...

1365
01:33:47,125 --> 01:33:48,417
to bring me back in the past.

1366
01:33:49,625 --> 01:33:50,625
He is mental.

1367
01:33:50,750 --> 01:33:53,292
I have to go back to save this girl's life.

1368
01:33:53,625 --> 01:33:56,084
If I can't find her, she'll die.

1369
01:33:56,959 --> 01:33:58,334
Oh crap.

1370
01:33:59,542 --> 01:34:02,542
Who would believe this lame reason.

1371
01:34:02,709 --> 01:34:03,500
I do!

1372
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:08,167
Are you serious? Because I am.

1373
01:34:08,209 --> 01:34:10,959
To travel back in the past,
and forward to the future

1374
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,542
is true, believe me.

1375
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:14,167
Didn't you see it in the movie?

1376
01:34:14,209 --> 01:34:15,917
Back To The Future

1377
01:34:16,084 --> 01:34:17,209
- Yeah.
- Oh.

1378
01:34:17,250 --> 01:34:17,959
It's at Rangsit.

1379
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,042
Yes, it goes back in time to Future Park.

1380
01:34:19,084 --> 01:34:21,209
Not that, you piece of shit.

1381
01:34:21,459 --> 01:34:22,834
Trust him, it's true.

1382
01:34:22,875 --> 01:34:24,667
So we should get going.

1383
01:34:24,792 --> 01:34:25,750
Let's go.

1384
01:34:25,792 --> 01:34:27,292
- Do we have to help him?
- Yeah.

1385
01:34:32,625 --> 01:34:33,667
Whoa!

1386
01:34:34,250 --> 01:34:35,250
Oh crap.

1387
01:34:35,292 --> 01:34:35,792
Damn it.

1388
01:34:35,917 --> 01:34:36,459
Shit.

1389
01:34:36,500 --> 01:34:37,625
Will we find it?

1390
01:34:38,792 --> 01:34:40,959
Just standing here, we won't find it, split up.

1391
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:41,709
Go.

1392
01:34:42,042 --> 01:34:43,625
What's the colour?

1393
01:34:44,417 --> 01:34:45,417
Damn it.

1394
01:34:46,125 --> 01:34:47,875
Is it the coin or card system?

1395
01:34:48,750 --> 01:34:50,084
Do, did you look at that one?

1396
01:34:50,125 --> 01:34:52,292
Did you look thoroughly?

1397
01:34:52,542 --> 01:34:54,042
Sure, in every corners.

1398
01:34:54,084 --> 01:34:56,000
I only see you talk.

1399
01:35:13,209 --> 01:35:14,000
Found it!

1400
01:35:14,167 --> 01:35:14,750
You found it?

1401
01:35:14,792 --> 01:35:15,417
Found it.

1402
01:35:16,167 --> 01:35:17,500
Go then. Go go.

1403
01:35:17,792 --> 01:35:19,125
I knew it must be this one.

1404
01:35:30,334 --> 01:35:30,875
Tum!

1405
01:35:31,834 --> 01:35:32,375
Tum!

1406
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:33,500
Tum!

1407
01:35:33,750 --> 01:35:35,417
- Yeah, yeah, I'm coming.
- Tum!

1408
01:35:36,292 --> 01:35:37,125
Coming.

1409
01:35:38,084 --> 01:35:39,084
Here I come.

1410
01:35:40,334 --> 01:35:41,500
Where have you been these days?

1411
01:35:41,542 --> 01:35:44,042
- Where is Som?
- Wait, wait.

1412
01:35:44,084 --> 01:35:45,167
Listen to me.

1413
01:35:45,834 --> 01:35:48,084
Som came here, she brought me this.

1414
01:35:48,125 --> 01:35:49,375
Where is she now?

1415
01:35:49,584 --> 01:35:51,375
- She told me...
- Where?

1416
01:35:51,875 --> 01:35:53,917
She was going to live with her mom in Chiang Mai.

1417
01:35:54,250 --> 01:35:55,750
What's wrong with you?

1418
01:35:58,417 --> 01:36:00,500
Will I get to talk to you properly? Damn it.

1419
01:36:02,959 --> 01:36:03,750
Kong?

1420
01:36:05,209 --> 01:36:06,167
Will you calm down?

1421
01:36:07,459 --> 01:36:08,500
Easy, easy.

1422
01:36:09,667 --> 01:36:10,875
Where are you going?

1423
01:36:12,042 --> 01:36:12,542
Kong!

1424
01:36:14,542 --> 01:36:15,042
Kong!

1425
01:36:20,667 --> 01:36:21,792
What's wrong with him?

1426
01:37:12,209 --> 01:37:12,875
Tum.

1427
01:37:14,500 --> 01:37:16,209
Thank you so much...

1428
01:37:16,792 --> 01:37:19,042
for being such a good brother to me.

1429
01:37:20,167 --> 01:37:22,542
I'm sorry that I have been messing with you.

1430
01:37:23,209 --> 01:37:24,709
For my brother. - Som

1431
01:37:24,750 --> 01:37:27,125
I did everything I could.

1432
01:37:28,334 --> 01:37:31,209
I really walk away from you now.

1433
01:37:33,625 --> 01:37:35,625
I wrote this song for you.

1434
01:37:37,084 --> 01:37:38,709
I hope you like it.

1435
01:37:40,417 --> 01:37:41,084
...Som."

1436
01:37:54,167 --> 01:37:58,417
Looking for an answer of what love is

1437
01:37:58,917 --> 01:38:05,292
from every words and letters.

1438
01:38:05,917 --> 01:38:07,959
Look into the songs

1439
01:38:08,500 --> 01:38:13,125
and listen in every melody and lyrics

1440
01:38:13,459 --> 01:38:16,459
but still don't understand.

1441
01:38:17,959 --> 01:38:23,792
Tens of thousands of messages, theories,

1442
01:38:24,334 --> 01:38:29,417
or meanings can never be touching.

1443
01:38:29,709 --> 01:38:35,375
Through the time until I met you,

1444
01:38:36,125 --> 01:38:38,834
How are you? Come to pick me up tomorrow.

1445
01:38:39,334 --> 01:38:42,334
There is someone waiting to use the phone.

1446
01:38:44,542 --> 01:38:45,667
I miss you.

1447
01:38:47,125 --> 01:38:48,084
How about you?

1448
01:38:49,125 --> 01:38:52,125
Ok, that should be all. Hey...

1449
01:38:53,084 --> 01:38:55,625
Tell mum to make curry.

1450
01:38:56,792 --> 01:39:00,167
Ok... yes, yes.

1451
01:39:00,375 --> 01:39:04,250
What love really is.

1452
01:39:04,834 --> 01:39:10,209
You make me realise,
love can be told through the eyes.

1453
01:39:11,042 --> 01:39:16,250
There is no need for more explanation.

1454
01:39:16,500 --> 01:39:20,209
When you look into my eyes,

1455
01:39:21,084 --> 01:39:22,250
- Mister.
- Yes.

1456
01:39:22,667 --> 01:39:24,417
Which one is going to Chiang Mai?

1457
01:39:24,584 --> 01:39:25,334
Chiang Mai?

1458
01:39:25,709 --> 01:39:27,000
Too late now.

1459
01:39:27,334 --> 01:39:29,709
There, the last one has just left.

1460
01:39:42,334 --> 01:39:42,834
Hey!

1461
01:39:43,125 --> 01:39:43,875
Stop!

1462
01:39:46,250 --> 01:39:46,834
Hey!

1463
01:39:49,875 --> 01:39:50,375
Hey!

1464
01:39:50,834 --> 01:39:51,459
Stop!

1465
01:39:56,125 --> 01:39:58,042
Aero-dynamic...

1466
01:39:58,375 --> 01:40:00,334
It generates more speed.

1467
01:40:00,584 --> 01:40:02,750
The racers like to lean down.

1468
01:40:04,250 --> 01:40:05,292
Aero-dynamic!

1469
01:40:11,917 --> 01:40:12,625
Huh?

1470
01:40:14,625 --> 01:40:17,125
You think you are so good, huh?

1471
01:40:18,584 --> 01:40:19,834
Stop, please!

1472
01:40:23,292 --> 01:40:25,125
Open it! Open!

1473
01:40:28,584 --> 01:40:29,209
Damn it!

1474
01:40:29,625 --> 01:40:31,250
We could be all dead!

1475
01:40:45,250 --> 01:40:45,792
What is it?

1476
01:40:46,167 --> 01:40:46,750
One moment.

1477
01:40:48,709 --> 01:40:50,667
Damn... sorry. I'm sorry.

1478
01:41:07,084 --> 01:41:09,959
Som, don't get into the bus, wait for me. Kong

1479
01:41:12,542 --> 01:41:14,375
Excuse me... sorry.

1480
01:41:47,875 --> 01:41:49,125
Did I get back already?

1481
01:41:50,167 --> 01:41:51,667
Get back my ass.

1482
01:41:52,042 --> 01:41:53,334
You haven't been anywhere.

1483
01:41:54,417 --> 01:41:56,167
You walked into the phone booth.

1484
01:41:57,084 --> 01:42:00,667
There is a thunder bolt and you were bounced here.

1485
01:42:01,792 --> 01:42:03,792
How's that? Back to the future?

1486
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:07,000
I told you, he is on high.

1487
01:42:09,625 --> 01:42:11,375
Flirting Card

1488
01:42:22,875 --> 01:42:23,792
Mam.

1489
01:42:24,042 --> 01:42:25,709
What do we have for dinner?

1490
01:42:25,917 --> 01:42:28,417
Who wanted to have omelet since yesterday?

1491
01:42:28,459 --> 01:42:29,125
Me.

1492
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:31,334
You look beautiful today.

1493
01:42:31,542 --> 01:42:32,875
You compliment me everyday.

1494
01:42:33,167 --> 01:42:34,709
I only have you, and only love you.

1495
01:42:34,750 --> 01:42:36,459
So I should compliment you everyday.

1496
01:42:36,542 --> 01:42:38,417
Aren't you shy in front of the kid?

1497
01:42:38,459 --> 01:42:40,542
No, and I'll do it everyday.

1498
01:42:41,417 --> 01:42:43,375
I want to go to the beach, let's go next week.

1499
01:42:43,500 --> 01:42:44,792
Ok, let's bring Kong along.

1500
01:42:44,917 --> 01:42:45,959
Or just the two of us?

1501
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:46,834
Two of us is fine too.

1502
01:42:46,875 --> 01:42:48,292
We might come back with one more.

1503
01:42:53,417 --> 01:42:54,000
Kong?

1504
01:42:55,750 --> 01:42:56,750
Where have you been?

1505
01:42:57,584 --> 01:42:59,375
Come here, now.

1506
01:42:59,667 --> 01:43:02,000
- Come, honey.
- Let's eat.

1507
01:43:02,042 --> 01:43:03,334
Let's eat what?

1508
01:43:03,834 --> 01:43:05,917
He came home in the morning,

1509
01:43:05,959 --> 01:43:08,125
shouldn't we ask where he has been?

1510
01:43:08,167 --> 01:43:11,167
Aren't you the bad example for him now?

1511
01:43:12,625 --> 01:43:13,667
I'm like this every day.

1512
01:43:14,334 --> 01:43:15,695
- But I finish work late...
- Wait.

1513
01:43:15,709 --> 01:43:16,750
Wait, it's not that.

1514
01:43:16,792 --> 01:43:19,209
Isn't that I was sleeping,
then you went out and came back?

1515
01:43:19,250 --> 01:43:20,584
And I didn't know, huh?

1516
01:43:21,167 --> 01:43:23,167
- No, I didn't.
- Don't you?

1517
01:43:23,209 --> 01:43:24,542
I don't know where Kong gets this from.

1518
01:43:24,584 --> 01:43:26,334
- Watch yourself.
- Let's eat.

1519
01:43:27,334 --> 01:43:28,500
Let's eat.

1520
01:43:28,542 --> 01:43:30,875
Here, it's from grandpa.

1521
01:43:31,875 --> 01:43:33,125
You must be excited.

1522
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:36,601
You got a new phone, aren't you excited?

1523
01:43:41,709 --> 01:43:43,084
It's kind of new.

1524
01:43:47,292 --> 01:43:49,959
I'm just happier that 3 of us get to sit

1525
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:51,959
and have a meal together.

1526
01:43:54,500 --> 01:43:56,667
I am very happy.

1527
01:43:58,209 --> 01:43:58,709
Tum.

1528
01:43:59,042 --> 01:43:59,584
Mam.

1529
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,667
What did you do to him? Why...?

1530
01:44:03,709 --> 01:44:05,709
- Are you ill?
- Why...?

1531
01:44:07,125 --> 01:44:08,042
It's not hot,

1532
01:44:08,209 --> 01:44:09,625
but I'm not sure if there's
something wrong inside.

1533
01:44:09,667 --> 01:44:11,417
How about we eat first, I'm hungry.

1534
01:44:11,459 --> 01:44:12,500
I've been waiting.

1535
01:44:13,375 --> 01:44:14,542
Ok, dad first.

1536
01:44:14,750 --> 01:44:15,709
Thank you.

1537
01:44:29,584 --> 01:44:33,667
Looks like I went back to fix the problem
for Tum and Mam.

1538
01:44:40,792 --> 01:44:42,084
But for Som and myself

1539
01:44:42,709 --> 01:44:44,375
even though it's not possible.

1540
01:44:45,959 --> 01:44:49,875
But at least it's my best memory.

1541
01:44:54,792 --> 01:44:55,959
But...

1542
01:44:57,334 --> 01:44:59,084
I'm still curious about one thing.

1543
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:17,000
Please check the number and try again.

1544
01:45:48,250 --> 01:45:49,042
Hello?

1545
01:45:53,750 --> 01:45:56,417
Hello? How can I help you?

1546
01:45:59,167 --> 01:46:03,209
Hello... may I speak to Som, please?

1547
01:46:04,625 --> 01:46:05,750
This is Som speaking.

1548
01:46:07,500 --> 01:46:08,209
Hello?

1549
01:46:09,459 --> 01:46:10,167
Hello?

1550
01:46:11,042 --> 01:46:11,834
Hello?

1551
01:46:12,584 --> 01:46:13,584
Is that a pervert?

1552
01:46:14,167 --> 01:46:15,084
Hello?

1553

Translated by Thanatcha Saksiamkul

1554
01:46:20,584 --> 01:46:25,459
I'd like to thank the world for creating you.

1555
01:46:26,084 --> 01:46:31,542
And it gives me the joyful moment.

1556
01:46:33,959 --> 01:46:39,167
Even though you are so far away.

1557
01:46:39,667 --> 01:46:48,625
I will still send you my love... to you.
