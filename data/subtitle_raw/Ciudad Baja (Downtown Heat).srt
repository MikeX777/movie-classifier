I've got this son of a bitch.

90
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,241

- Shit!

106
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:22,260
Did you tell Maria?

107
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,088
- Not yet.

108
00:08:32,995 --> 00:08:33,892
- So long, man.

109
00:08:37,033 --> 00:08:38,000
I'll do it.

110
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,553
- You'll do what?

111
00:08:39,553 --> 00:08:41,486
- I'll talk to Maria.

112
00:08:41,486 --> 00:08:42,867
You know where she is?

113
00:08:42,867 --> 00:08:44,247
- She's working on the
 missing American girls sting,

114
00:08:44,247 --> 00:08:45,801
with the Anti-Drug Force.

115
00:08:47,699 --> 00:08:50,978
Luis Barbosa, that's another
 scumbag who was in drugs.

116
00:08:52,152 --> 00:08:54,188
- She's got needle
 marks all over,

117
00:08:54,188 --> 00:08:55,535
in her goddamn neck.

118
00:08:56,777 --> 00:08:57,606

 waiting to see you.

121
00:09:11,274 --> 00:09:12,931
- Let him wait, I'm busy!

122
00:09:23,804 --> 00:09:26,496
I'd like to speak to Don Thomas.

123
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,397
Look, Badal calling.

[phone rings]

125
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,883
- Hello.

126
00:09:33,883 --> 00:09:36,990
No, this is his personal
assistant, Chucho.

127
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:38,923
Don Thomas is in a
 meeting right now,

128
00:09:38,923 --> 00:09:41,097
he can't be disturbed.

129
00:09:41,097 --> 00:09:43,272
- This is Inspector Badal.

130
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:48,760
Please tell Don Thomas
 that one of your men

131
00:09:51,073 --> 00:09:53,731
is leaving Consul [indistinct].

132
00:09:53,731 --> 00:09:57,389
He's driving a car which
belongs to Don Thomas.

133
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:58,805
[gentle piano music]

134
00:09:58,805 --> 00:10:02,360
We checked it from
 the license plate.

135
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:06,744
Tell Don Thomas that
 I have done my best.

136
00:10:08,331 --> 00:10:12,335
That that is kind of
 mistake can't happen again,

137
00:10:13,509 --> 00:10:15,822
I'm not the chief of police,

138
00:10:16,788 --> 00:10:20,309
nor the Minister
of the Interior.

139
00:10:20,309 --> 00:10:21,793
And this kind of thing-

140
00:10:21,793 --> 00:10:23,623
- [Chucho] All right, all
 right, you have my word,

141
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:24,727
this won't happen again.

142
00:10:24,727 --> 00:10:26,349
- And I must clean up-

143
00:10:26,349 --> 00:10:28,144
- [Chucho] I will. Goodbye.

144
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:33,633
- He's as oily as a snake.

145
00:10:35,048 --> 00:10:36,981
What did he want
 anyway, essentially?

146
00:10:36,981 --> 00:10:40,501
- It's Flores, he must've
 gotten rid of a girl,

147
00:10:40,501 --> 00:10:42,331
and he offed a cop.

148
00:10:42,331 --> 00:10:45,368
And he let them see the
 plates on one of our cars.

149
00:10:48,578 --> 00:10:50,960
- I never want to
 hear from him again.

150
00:10:51,961 --> 00:10:52,755
Never.

151
00:10:54,308 --> 00:10:55,827
All right?

152
00:10:55,827 --> 00:10:56,656
- Okay.

153
00:10:57,587 --> 00:11:01,212
[soft piano music continues]

154
00:11:08,737 --> 00:11:10,670
- [Chief of police] Well,
 we've been waiting for you.

155
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,810
- I'm sorry for
 the interruption,

156
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,604
but it seems that
 one of my employees,

157
00:11:14,604 --> 00:11:17,055
at the consolute had
 a little car trouble.

158
00:11:17,055 --> 00:11:18,850
- Nothing serious, I hope.

159
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:19,679
- I hope not.

160
00:11:20,818 --> 00:11:23,372
May I have a review
with the bidding please?

161
00:11:23,372 --> 00:11:28,066
- His Honor opened two diamonds,
two spades, Juno trumps.

162
00:11:29,412 --> 00:11:31,035
- [Thomas] Fine.

163
00:11:31,035 --> 00:11:31,898
- Four spades.

164
00:11:31,898 --> 00:11:34,659
[sirens wailing]

165
00:11:43,254 --> 00:11:46,291

[sirens wailing]

167
00:12:08,486 --> 00:12:09,901
- Excuse me.

168
00:12:09,901 --> 00:12:11,213
- Wait a minute.

169
00:12:11,213 --> 00:12:12,421
- All right, I'm sorry.

170
00:12:12,421 --> 00:12:14,975
- No, I know, I know, I know!

171
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,942
We-

172
00:12:15,942 --> 00:12:16,943
- I had him!

173
00:12:18,082 --> 00:12:19,980
He's one of those
 assholes dealing drugs

174
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,741
to little girls, pimps them,

175
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:24,709
and then kills them off
 when they get outta line!

176
00:12:24,709 --> 00:12:26,435
He killed my partner!

177
00:12:26,435 --> 00:12:27,988
And I had the son of a bitch!

178
00:12:27,988 --> 00:12:28,851
- Easy!

179
00:12:30,232 --> 00:12:31,198
There was no time.

180
00:12:32,337 --> 00:12:34,098
We didn't have a
 car anywhere around.

181
00:12:35,858 --> 00:12:37,515
- Then why'd you call me off?

182
00:12:37,515 --> 00:12:38,412
I had him.

183
00:12:38,412 --> 00:12:39,689
[hand slams]

184
00:12:39,689 --> 00:12:42,796
- Because I lost one of
my best guys tonight,

185
00:12:44,073 --> 00:12:46,282
that's enough for me.

186
00:12:46,282 --> 00:12:48,768
I didn't want to lose you too.

187
00:12:51,184 --> 00:12:52,875
- What about the car?

188
00:12:54,394 --> 00:12:55,913
- Stolen.

189
00:12:55,913 --> 00:12:59,779
Registered to an
ambassador or something.

190
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,953
He reported the
 theft a few days ago.

191
00:13:01,953 --> 00:13:04,300
[Al scoffs]

192
00:13:09,512 --> 00:13:10,755
- Want one?

193
00:13:10,755 --> 00:13:12,343
- I'm on the wagon.

194
00:13:15,725 --> 00:13:18,659
One second, I'll
 be right with you.

195
00:13:26,529 --> 00:13:29,049
Is officer Maria
 Mendoza back yet?

196
00:13:32,052 --> 00:13:32,881
Thanks.

197
00:13:37,955 --> 00:13:39,957
She already knows about Carlos.

198
00:13:39,957 --> 00:13:41,199
- Who told her?

199
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,719
- Who knows. Some
 diplomat, maybe.

200
00:13:44,651 --> 00:13:46,687
Would you like a cup of coffee?

201
00:13:46,687 --> 00:13:47,999
- No. Thank you.

202
00:13:49,242 --> 00:13:50,657
- You still haven't
 heard from your wife?

203
00:13:50,657 --> 00:13:51,485
- No.

204
00:13:52,417 --> 00:13:53,694
- Come with me.

205
00:13:53,694 --> 00:13:55,282
- If Maria calls,
 I'm in the cooler.

206
00:13:55,282 --> 00:13:56,594
- [Vinny] Roger.

207
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,252
- You already saw
 her, didn't you?

208
00:13:59,252 --> 00:14:00,770
- Yeah, but I'd like
 you to show this man

209
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,289
both of the girls
 they brought in today.

210
00:14:02,289 --> 00:14:05,292
- [Coroner] There were three.

211
00:14:05,292 --> 00:14:07,191
- It's cold in here.

212
00:14:07,191 --> 00:14:08,399
- You're right.

213
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,884
[tense music]

214
00:14:13,231 --> 00:14:14,060
- OD's?

215
00:14:20,549 --> 00:14:21,481
All three?

216
00:14:21,481 --> 00:14:22,551
- [Coroner] It looks that way.

217
00:14:25,105 --> 00:14:27,694
[Paul belches]

218
00:14:35,012 --> 00:14:35,875
- Excuse me.

219
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:40,465
- The entertainment's not
 so great in this place.

220
00:14:40,465 --> 00:14:43,020
- You think my wife
 will end up like that?

221
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:43,952
- Maybe not.

222
00:14:43,952 --> 00:14:45,539
Maybe she's just getting it on

223
00:14:45,539 --> 00:14:48,301
with some guy who's
better looking than you.

224
00:14:48,301 --> 00:14:49,578
- What?

225
00:14:49,578 --> 00:14:51,097
- No, nothing.

226
00:14:51,097 --> 00:14:53,754
I'm sorry, had a bad day.

227
00:14:53,754 --> 00:14:55,066
- I'd thank God.

228
00:14:55,066 --> 00:14:56,585
- Hmm?

229
00:14:56,585 --> 00:14:58,828
- If that's where she's gone,
 if that's what she's doing,

230
00:14:58,828 --> 00:15:00,416
I'd get done on my
 knees and thank God

231
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:02,798
that she's alive,
 and that's all.

232
00:15:02,798 --> 00:15:04,420
- You're sure she was a user?

233
00:15:05,594 --> 00:15:08,217
And it's been two weeks
since she disappeared?

234
00:15:08,217 --> 00:15:09,184
- 15 days.

235
00:15:12,256 --> 00:15:13,464
- Why don't you go home,

236
00:15:13,464 --> 00:15:15,811
I'll let you know when
 we find something.

237
00:15:15,811 --> 00:15:17,295
- Go home. Yeah.

238
00:15:18,814 --> 00:15:19,815
I've just been away.

239
00:15:21,575 --> 00:15:24,233
[lighter rasps]

240
00:15:26,753 --> 00:15:28,237
We got married six months ago.

241
00:15:30,136 --> 00:15:34,036
I didn't know she used drugs.

242
00:15:34,036 --> 00:15:37,660
She thought that our love would
help her get her straight.

243
00:15:38,523 --> 00:15:40,008
- How old did you say she was?

244
00:15:41,423 --> 00:15:42,251
- 20.

245
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:47,118
[Paul coughing]

246
00:15:47,118 --> 00:15:47,947
I don't smoke.

247
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,224
- Come up to the office,

248
00:15:49,224 --> 00:15:50,880
we'll get a cup of coffee.

249
00:16:11,832 --> 00:16:12,661
- Hi, Flores.

250
00:16:14,594 --> 00:16:17,252
- Chucho, You scared
 the hell outta me.

251
00:16:17,252 --> 00:16:18,908
What the hell's wrong with you?

252
00:16:18,908 --> 00:16:21,808
Turn the headlights
off, you're blinding me.

253
00:16:21,808 --> 00:16:24,259
- You had a little
 accident tonight.

254
00:16:24,259 --> 00:16:26,778
- You say that like
 I shit in my pants.

255
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:28,021
[Flores scoffs]

256
00:16:28,021 --> 00:16:29,919
I had to get rid of
 a girl, that's all.

257
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,232
It was crazy.

258
00:16:33,716 --> 00:16:36,581
He jumped out in front of
 my car and yelled "stop".

259
00:16:38,169 --> 00:16:40,758
Chucho, did you think
 I was gonna pull over

260
00:16:40,758 --> 00:16:42,277
and show 'em my license?

261
00:16:42,277 --> 00:16:44,693
- But you left your
 business card, man.

262
00:16:44,693 --> 00:16:47,282
[fingers snap]

263
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:52,701
- Shit, the damn cover came off.

264
00:16:52,701 --> 00:16:56,015
So, you come to chew me out
 because the old man got mad?

265
00:16:57,292 --> 00:16:59,294
Turn those lights off, will you?

266
00:16:59,294 --> 00:17:01,399
- They make you nervous?

267
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:04,713
- Come on, stop playing around.

268
00:17:04,713 --> 00:17:07,302
I get the message, I fucked up.

269
00:17:07,302 --> 00:17:08,372
Don't worry about it.

270
00:17:09,787 --> 00:17:13,066
Chucho, you remember when
 we got caught stealing

271
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:15,448
that car when we was kids.

272
00:17:15,448 --> 00:17:16,276
- I remember.

273
00:17:18,485 --> 00:17:21,350
- Boy, did we ever
fuck up that time, hey?

274
00:17:22,731 --> 00:17:23,939
It was worth it, though.

275
00:17:24,871 --> 00:17:26,528
Remember that car?

276
00:17:26,528 --> 00:17:27,770
It was a pretty car.

277
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:33,086
[guns firing]
[Flores groans]

278
00:17:33,086 --> 00:17:35,537
[knees thud]

279
00:17:35,537 --> 00:17:37,021
- Pretty car.

280
00:17:37,021 --> 00:17:38,402
[gun fires]

281
00:17:38,402 --> 00:17:40,852
- It was a fucking
 Chevy, Flores.

282
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:45,340
- Thanks for everything.

283
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,548
- Don't mention it.

284
00:17:46,548 --> 00:17:48,688
I'll call you as soon
 as we get a lead.

285
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:51,691
- In any case, if
 you don't mind,

286
00:17:51,691 --> 00:17:53,555
I'll come back to
 see how you're doing,

287
00:17:53,555 --> 00:17:55,557
I don't have much else to do.

288
00:17:55,557 --> 00:17:56,385
- Sure.

289
00:17:59,354 --> 00:18:00,182
Maria.

290
00:18:01,045 --> 00:18:03,082
[lips smacking]

291
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,842
- You feeling better?

292
00:18:07,016 --> 00:18:08,156
- Hi.
 - Hi.

293
00:18:08,156 --> 00:18:09,950
- Paul. Paul Boles.

294
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:10,848
- What's going on?

295
00:18:13,609 --> 00:18:15,542
- They told you, right?

296
00:18:15,542 --> 00:18:17,130
- I came soon as I could.

297
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,098
You need me for
 the identification.

298
00:18:19,995 --> 00:18:21,238
- Yes.

299
00:18:21,238 --> 00:18:22,101
- Okay.

300
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,414
Hi.

301
00:18:25,414 --> 00:18:26,243
- Hi.

302
00:18:49,956 --> 00:18:51,785
- This one too?
- Yeah.

303
00:18:53,787 --> 00:18:55,755
[tense music]

304
00:18:55,755 --> 00:18:58,896
- Carlos! [Maria sobs]

305
00:18:58,896 --> 00:19:02,589
- We were at Muller's Point,
 they opened fire at us.

306
00:19:02,589 --> 00:19:04,143
- You son of a bitch!

307
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,662
You let him die,
 you son of a bitch.

308
00:19:06,662 --> 00:19:08,147
How could you do it?

309
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:11,011
You son of a bitch!
 You son of a bitch!

310
00:19:11,011 --> 00:19:14,256
You let him die! [crying]

[people chattering]

313
00:19:42,111 --> 00:19:44,907
- They just tell
 me you were here.

314
00:19:44,907 --> 00:19:45,736
I'm sorry.

315
00:19:46,702 --> 00:19:48,532
- Maria, come with me.

316
00:19:52,674 --> 00:19:55,055
- Captain, we've got
 a possible homicide

317
00:19:55,055 --> 00:19:57,955
at the harbor, and a car that
 [indistinct] description.

318
00:19:57,955 --> 00:19:59,612
- [hand slams] Get them there!

319
00:20:04,444 --> 00:20:08,690
Um, you can stay here
 and see to Maria.

320
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:12,107
- I'm going down, I wanna see
 if it's the car I was chasing.

321
00:20:16,042 --> 00:20:18,182
Can you wait for her?

322
00:20:18,182 --> 00:20:19,494
- I got nothing else to do.

323
00:20:20,771 --> 00:20:25,776
[sirens wailing]
 [upbeat jazz music]

324
00:20:42,413 --> 00:20:43,897
- Good evening, detective.

325
00:20:43,897 --> 00:20:45,796
I saw the whole thing.

326
00:20:45,796 --> 00:20:47,073
- Are you the one who called?

327
00:20:47,073 --> 00:20:48,695
- He was too drunk
 to see the numbers,

328
00:20:48,695 --> 00:20:50,249
I had to dial.

329
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:53,735
- I was coming out
 of the Barking Dog,

330
00:20:53,735 --> 00:20:56,358
I was having a glass of milk.

331
00:20:56,358 --> 00:20:57,394
- Milk, my arse.

332
00:20:57,394 --> 00:20:59,465
- Will you please shut up,

333
00:20:59,465 --> 00:21:00,707
I'm telling you a story.

334
00:21:01,881 --> 00:21:05,160
- That's him. He's the
one that killed Carlos.

335
00:21:06,713 --> 00:21:09,095
- [Drunk man] Guns
 rang out like thunder.

336
00:21:09,095 --> 00:21:10,821
I hid among the bushes.

337
00:21:10,821 --> 00:21:13,927
And did I mention
 that I am a pacifist?

338
00:21:13,927 --> 00:21:18,035
And then the cars came
 rolling up like butterflies.

339
00:21:18,035 --> 00:21:19,864
- [Sailor] Rolling
 up like butterflies?

340
00:21:19,864 --> 00:21:22,384
- Butterflies flutter,
 they don't roll.

341
00:21:22,384 --> 00:21:23,661
- Will you, please.

342
00:21:23,661 --> 00:21:26,423
If I'm saying the
 butterflies roll,

343
00:21:26,423 --> 00:21:28,079
they damn well gonna roll.

344
00:21:29,736 --> 00:21:34,154
Like I was saying, the
 two cars come fluttering,

345
00:21:34,154 --> 00:21:36,881
and two guys come up and dump

346
00:21:36,881 --> 00:21:39,850
that poor bastard in the fish.

347
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:43,198
Then they leave so quick they
 forgot one of their cars.

348
00:21:43,198 --> 00:21:44,164
- Search him.

349
00:21:44,164 --> 00:21:45,787
If you find a ring, arrest him.

350
00:21:53,035 --> 00:21:58,006
- You cut off his damn
 finger, you stupid old drunk.

351
00:21:58,765 --> 00:21:59,559
- He wasn't using it.

352
00:22:00,491 --> 00:22:01,527
- Take them both in.

353
00:22:03,563 --> 00:22:07,809
[commentating in
 foreign language]

354
00:22:08,706 --> 00:22:09,776
- Good night.

355
00:22:12,054 --> 00:22:14,747
- I'll ask you to take you home.

356
00:22:14,747 --> 00:22:16,058
That is if you don't mind.

357
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,442
- That is nice of
 you, but I'll manage.

358
00:22:27,173 --> 00:22:29,658
[Maria sighs]

359
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,938
It wouldn't be too much trouble?

360
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,815
Where you from?

361
00:22:48,815 --> 00:22:50,852
- California, San Francisco.

362
00:22:53,095 --> 00:22:53,855
- It's cold.

363
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:04,106
You a friend of Al Romeros'?

364
00:23:04,106 --> 00:23:04,935
- Not exactly.

365
00:23:06,902 --> 00:23:08,387
- He's a nice guy, he's...

366
00:23:09,871 --> 00:23:11,493
He was my husband's best friend.

367
00:23:13,495 --> 00:23:15,221
That's the one, the brick.

368
00:23:25,956 --> 00:23:28,752
- You wouldn't wanna
 have a cup of coffee?

369
00:23:28,752 --> 00:23:29,753
- No thanks.

370
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,170
- Sorry, I understand.

371
00:23:35,034 --> 00:23:36,207
- What's your name?

372
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:37,761
- Paul. Paul Boles.

373
00:23:38,831 --> 00:23:39,832
- Bye, Paul.

374
00:23:43,387 --> 00:23:45,458
Your scarf.

375
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:47,391
- It's Allyson's scarf.

376
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,394
I hope she'll be
able to wear it.

377
00:23:50,394 --> 00:23:52,707
- Why do you say that?

378
00:23:52,707 --> 00:23:54,640
- She's been missing
 for two weeks.

379
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,468
- Drugs?

380
00:23:56,676 --> 00:23:57,746
I think I'll have
 that cup of coffee,

381
00:23:57,746 --> 00:23:59,783
I can't face going home.

382
00:24:00,853 --> 00:24:02,475
[elegant piano music]

383
00:24:02,475 --> 00:24:04,995
- [Paul] Maria, make
 yourself at home.

384
00:24:07,273 --> 00:24:08,447
- Is that her?

385
00:24:10,172 --> 00:24:11,657
She's very pretty.

386
00:24:18,595 --> 00:24:23,600
[leaves rustling]
 [wind howling]

387
00:24:30,054 --> 00:24:30,883
- Maria!

388
00:24:32,263 --> 00:24:36,267
[elegant piano music continues]

389
00:24:46,036 --> 00:24:47,382
- Have you been married long?

390
00:24:47,382 --> 00:24:48,210
- No long, no.

391
00:24:50,316 --> 00:24:51,835
- I was married six years.

392
00:24:53,457 --> 00:24:55,528
We were planning to
 have a baby next year.

393
00:24:56,667 --> 00:24:57,496
We had waited.

394
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:03,018
We were both very busy working.

395
00:25:03,881 --> 00:25:05,020
- Allyson was...

396
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,990
I hope to God she
 still is pregnant.

397
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:10,439
- [Maria] How'd you meet her?

398
00:25:12,303 --> 00:25:13,512
- We met in New Orleans.

399
00:25:14,789 --> 00:25:16,169
I was doing a session,

400
00:25:16,169 --> 00:25:17,999
and she comes in while
 I'm doing a solo.

401
00:25:17,999 --> 00:25:19,932
- When'd she get into drugs?

402
00:25:19,932 --> 00:25:22,037
- I didn't know
 anything about that.

403
00:25:22,037 --> 00:25:24,246
You know, you see things.

404
00:25:24,246 --> 00:25:25,420
How money disappears.

405
00:25:27,111 --> 00:25:29,044
But I thought that
 was all over long ago.

406
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:32,358
She said she wanted
 to make a new start.

407
00:25:34,222 --> 00:25:36,845
She said if I was strong
enough I could help her.

408
00:25:36,845 --> 00:25:38,433
I guess I wasn't strong enough.

409
00:25:42,575 --> 00:25:43,956
A couple of months
 ago I had to go back

410
00:25:43,956 --> 00:25:45,233
to the States to
 see this guy I know

411
00:25:45,233 --> 00:25:47,235
about doing the
 music for a movie,

412
00:25:48,512 --> 00:25:50,721
I was only gone
 a couple of days,

413
00:25:50,721 --> 00:25:53,241
but when I got back
 it was different.

414
00:25:54,345 --> 00:25:55,312
She'd met somebody.

415
00:25:56,727 --> 00:25:58,798
- Do you mean another guy?

416
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:00,075
- Yeah. I mean, no.

417
00:26:01,387 --> 00:26:02,871
Another girl.

418
00:26:02,871 --> 00:26:04,390
They went everywhere together.

419
00:26:05,805 --> 00:26:08,394
Got to the point where
 we hardly saw each other.

420
00:26:08,394 --> 00:26:10,603
So I asked her, "What
the hell was going on?"

421
00:26:11,639 --> 00:26:12,709
She told me, nothing.

422
00:26:14,607 --> 00:26:16,333
For a few weeks
 it was fine again.

423
00:26:17,403 --> 00:26:18,335
Like it used to be.

424
00:26:19,543 --> 00:26:22,408
Then, after a while, she
started going out again.

425
00:26:23,271 --> 00:26:25,687
Late at night, no explanation.

426
00:26:29,346 --> 00:26:30,727
So one night I found some works

427
00:26:30,727 --> 00:26:32,176
on the floor in the bathroom.

428
00:26:34,351 --> 00:26:35,835
I was gonna scream at her,

429
00:26:35,835 --> 00:26:38,113
tell her she was throwing
 everything away for nothing.

430
00:26:39,528 --> 00:26:43,602
I waited up all night long,
 but she never came home.

431
00:26:46,432 --> 00:26:48,607
She still hasn't come home.

432
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,229
- Paul, can I tell
 you something?

433
00:26:50,229 --> 00:26:53,128
I work for the antidrug unit
 in the police department.

434
00:26:54,164 --> 00:26:56,511
So did Al Romero and Carlos,

435
00:26:56,511 --> 00:26:57,857
until they got transferred.

436
00:26:58,893 --> 00:27:01,102
The thing is, we were working

437
00:27:01,102 --> 00:27:03,656
on identifying the
 high-level dealers.

438
00:27:03,656 --> 00:27:06,038
Only, we had a lot of
 trouble getting evidence.

439
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:08,454
Then came the transfers.

440
00:27:09,524 --> 00:27:11,526
You see what I'm getting at?

441
00:27:11,526 --> 00:27:14,011
- You mean the police
 are in on this?

442
00:27:14,011 --> 00:27:16,082
- Yeah. In on it or bought off.

443
00:27:18,188 --> 00:27:20,604
- But the antidrug is a part
 of the police, isn't it?

444
00:27:20,604 --> 00:27:24,194
- Well, it's supposed
to be independent, but.

445
00:27:26,921 --> 00:27:28,577
[Paul sighs]

446
00:27:28,577 --> 00:27:31,304
- You can't trust anybody.

447
00:27:31,304 --> 00:27:36,309
- Myself, Al, maybe one
 or two others beyond that.

448
00:27:39,312 --> 00:27:40,520
Can I make a phone call?

449
00:27:41,867 --> 00:27:42,695
- Sure.

450
00:27:46,699 --> 00:27:49,875
[phone dial whirring]

451
00:27:55,363 --> 00:27:56,882
- Maria Mendoza speaking.

452
00:27:57,779 --> 00:27:58,642
Yes.

453
00:28:01,093 --> 00:28:02,577
Okay, thanks.

454
00:28:02,577 --> 00:28:03,405
Fine.

455
00:28:09,998 --> 00:28:11,724
I've got a few days off.

456
00:28:11,724 --> 00:28:13,243
If there's anything
 I can do for you,

457
00:28:13,243 --> 00:28:14,969
please let me know.

458
00:28:14,969 --> 00:28:16,384
- All right.

459
00:28:16,384 --> 00:28:17,385
Can I take you home?

460
00:28:19,076 --> 00:28:20,664
- Thanks, I'm really
 feeling much better,

461
00:28:20,664 --> 00:28:22,597
I'd like to walk a bit.

462
00:28:22,597 --> 00:28:23,598
- All right.

463
00:28:30,812 --> 00:28:32,124
- Maria, what can I do?

464
00:28:33,746 --> 00:28:34,920
- Go to the U.S. Embassy,

465
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,232
bang on the table until
they do something.

466
00:28:38,095 --> 00:28:38,924
- I already did.

467
00:28:40,373 --> 00:28:42,272
They swear they're
 doing all they can.

468
00:28:45,654 --> 00:28:48,209
- Why don't you try
 finding the girl?

469
00:28:48,209 --> 00:28:49,141
- You mean Melissa?

470
00:28:50,763 --> 00:28:51,626
- Yeah.
- But she wasn't

471
00:28:51,626 --> 00:28:52,558
seeing her anymore.

472
00:28:55,112 --> 00:28:56,355
- Are you sure?

473
00:29:08,229 --> 00:29:10,818
[wind howling]

474
00:29:14,442 --> 00:29:18,032

[soft music]

480
00:33:21,102 --> 00:33:23,760
- Aren't you ashamed
 to be seen like that?

481
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,589
- Why should I be?

482
00:33:25,589 --> 00:33:29,800
You are the first man
 who ever saw me naked.

483
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,423
- I don't remember.

484
00:33:31,423 --> 00:33:35,116
- How could you forget,
it was my birthday.

485
00:33:35,116 --> 00:33:37,567
- Ah, but that's
 not the same thing.

486
00:33:37,567 --> 00:33:42,572
You we're fat, pink, ugly,
 and you were screaming.

487
00:33:45,471 --> 00:33:48,026
- [Lupita] Can I
 have the sports car?

488
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,442
- You have the will? No.

489
00:33:50,442 --> 00:33:51,546
- Why not?

490
00:33:51,546 --> 00:33:52,478
- I made inquires.

491
00:33:53,548 --> 00:33:57,449
No money, no education,
common family.

492
00:33:58,967 --> 00:34:01,694
- Yeah, but it's a Valenti.

493
00:34:01,694 --> 00:34:02,730
[hand slaps]

494
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:04,421
- Mind your mouth, young lady.

495
00:34:05,526 --> 00:34:08,770
[soft music continues]

496
00:34:19,505 --> 00:34:20,506
- Dad! Okay?

497
00:34:22,025 --> 00:34:23,647
- Take the car, but be careful,

498
00:34:23,647 --> 00:34:25,442
don't let that dummy
 near the wheel.

499
00:34:26,857 --> 00:34:28,583
- That nosy cop is
 here to see you.

500
00:34:30,033 --> 00:34:32,070
- I told you I didn't
 want to see him.

501
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,519
- I spoke to the inspector,

502
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:35,763
it's just about the
 report on the stolen car.

503
00:34:38,662 --> 00:34:41,389
- Oh. I'll talk to him.

504
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:44,185
But it seems like you can't
 live in this country anymore

505
00:34:44,185 --> 00:34:47,257
without the government poking
 its nose into your business.

506
00:34:49,363 --> 00:34:52,642
[soft music continues]

507
00:34:57,129 --> 00:35:00,063
- You're gonna take that
 little jerk out for a spin?

508
00:35:00,063 --> 00:35:01,789
- What is it to you, pussface?

509
00:35:13,249 --> 00:35:14,112
- Officer.

510
00:35:16,252 --> 00:35:21,049
- Early Mason, very
 nice, very expensive.

511
00:35:21,049 --> 00:35:22,637
- You're an art connoisseur?

512
00:35:23,811 --> 00:35:26,676
- Actually, I don't
 have much of a chance

513
00:35:26,676 --> 00:35:28,402
to move in those circles.

514
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:31,439
- Police work must
 be very difficult?

515
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,856
- [Al] You should see
 some of the characters

516
00:35:34,856 --> 00:35:36,030
we have to talk to.

517
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,621
- My assistant tells me
you're here on business.

518
00:35:40,621 --> 00:35:42,795
- That's right, just routine.

519
00:35:44,176 --> 00:35:46,523
It appears there'd
 been some mistake

520
00:35:46,523 --> 00:35:48,698
on your report,
 on the stolen car.

521
00:35:50,251 --> 00:35:52,667
- My secretary takes care
 of this sort of thing.

522
00:35:54,255 --> 00:35:55,705
What kind of a mistake?

523
00:35:55,705 --> 00:35:59,260
- Your car was stolen
 on February 3rd.

524
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,158
Is that right?

525
00:36:01,366 --> 00:36:02,229
- I suppose so.

526
00:36:03,644 --> 00:36:04,472
- No.

527
00:36:10,754 --> 00:36:15,034
- Here you are getting
 out of the stolen car

528
00:36:15,034 --> 00:36:17,002
to go to the OMS party.

529
00:36:17,002 --> 00:36:19,936
Do you remember that?
 - I think so.

530
00:36:19,936 --> 00:36:22,076
- The OMS party was
 on February 4th.

531
00:36:24,216 --> 00:36:26,149
- Quite right,
 officer, there appears

532
00:36:26,149 --> 00:36:27,599
to be an error in the date.

533
00:36:28,634 --> 00:36:30,153
- Of course.

534
00:36:30,153 --> 00:36:31,913
- My secretary will go to
 bed without his supper.

535
00:36:31,913 --> 00:36:33,087
- I'll release the car for you.

536
00:36:33,087 --> 00:36:34,916
- Fine. Will that be all?

537
00:36:34,916 --> 00:36:35,917
- One more thing.

538
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,335
[plastic rustling]

539
00:36:39,335 --> 00:36:40,198
This.

540
00:36:42,027 --> 00:36:42,855
No.

541
00:36:44,685 --> 00:36:46,169
Is this yours?

542
00:36:46,169 --> 00:36:47,515
- I don't believe so.

543
00:36:47,515 --> 00:36:48,861
- Sure it is, sure.

544
00:36:49,931 --> 00:36:50,760
See..

545
00:36:55,074 --> 00:36:57,732
Here's the bill on the jewelers.

546
00:37:00,701 --> 00:37:01,529
Expensive.

547
00:37:02,737 --> 00:37:04,670
It will probably cost
 more than the painting

548
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:08,018
- Of course, I
remember this ring now.

549
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:09,779
- Of course you will.

550
00:37:09,779 --> 00:37:13,748
If you'll just sign
 the receipt for it.

551
00:37:17,821 --> 00:37:20,376
Read it. The description is-

552
00:37:20,376 --> 00:37:22,032
- I trust our police department.

553
00:37:22,895 --> 00:37:24,414
- You are very trustworthy.

554
00:37:25,691 --> 00:37:28,107
Don't you wanna know
 how we found it?

555
00:37:29,523 --> 00:37:30,524
- Naturally.

556
00:37:31,697 --> 00:37:34,528
- We found it,
 reported by a drunk

557
00:37:34,528 --> 00:37:36,530
who have cut a
 finger off a corpse

558
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:38,773
with a jackknife to get it.

559
00:37:38,773 --> 00:37:40,016
- Gruesome.

560
00:37:40,016 --> 00:37:42,501
You do move in
 different stories.

561
00:37:42,501 --> 00:37:43,916
- You know whose?

562
00:37:43,916 --> 00:37:44,745
- Who's what?

563
00:37:44,745 --> 00:37:46,264
- Whose corpse?

564
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:49,405
It was a certain Flores Fuentes.

565
00:37:49,405 --> 00:37:50,302
Did you know him?

566
00:37:51,372 --> 00:37:52,925
- The name means nothing to me.

567
00:37:54,444 --> 00:37:55,997
- Of course not.

568
00:37:55,997 --> 00:37:58,241
You wouldn't know
 anybody like that.

569
00:37:58,241 --> 00:38:00,864
He was a cheap
 gangster, a murder,

570
00:38:00,864 --> 00:38:03,281
and a car thief, not your type.

571
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,903
- That's an interesting story.

572
00:38:04,903 --> 00:38:06,284
Will that be all now?

573
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,802
- For the moment.

574
00:38:07,802 --> 00:38:10,011
- Thank you very much for
 all you've done, officer.

575
00:38:10,011 --> 00:38:12,773
I'll send a check to the
 Police Benevolent Association.

576
00:38:14,982 --> 00:38:16,811
- You're a real nice guy, Don.

577
00:38:17,709 --> 00:38:20,988
[soft music continues]

578
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:31,792
- How the hell did Flores
 get his hands on this ring?

579
00:38:31,792 --> 00:38:33,656
- Maybe you ought to ask Lupita.

580
00:38:33,656 --> 00:38:35,623
- What would she know
 about that creep?

581
00:38:39,558 --> 00:38:43,562
[sighs] Encourageable little...

582
00:38:44,667 --> 00:38:46,116
She reminds me of her mother.

583
00:38:49,499 --> 00:38:50,811
- B14 to headquarters.

584
00:38:50,811 --> 00:38:53,020
[radio hisses]

585
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:55,816
B14 to headquarters.
 Let me speak to Badal.

586
00:38:55,816 --> 00:38:56,679
[radio hisses]

587
00:38:56,679 --> 00:38:58,405
- [Badal] Badal.

588
00:38:58,405 --> 00:39:00,027
- I just saw him.

589
00:39:00,027 --> 00:39:04,031
He's a nice guy, just like
 you said, he was very polite.

590
00:39:05,273 --> 00:39:07,414
He's even going to send
a check to the PBA,

591
00:39:07,414 --> 00:39:08,794
isn't that great?

592
00:39:08,794 --> 00:39:11,866
- [Badal] I told
 you, he's a nice boy.

593
00:39:11,866 --> 00:39:14,421
- He's one of the nicest
pricks I ever met.

594
00:39:15,594 --> 00:39:20,358
[car engine roars]
 [metal clanging]

595
00:39:36,684 --> 00:39:39,584
[buttons clicking]

596
00:39:44,002 --> 00:39:45,383
[fist thudding]

597
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:48,316
Is this the Marine Life
Conservation Group?

598
00:39:49,697 --> 00:39:54,081
I like to speak to
 Mr. Steve Brevin.

599
00:39:54,081 --> 00:39:55,841
I'm calling long distance.

600
00:40:05,126 --> 00:40:08,336
[phone rings]

601
00:40:08,336 --> 00:40:09,407
- Brevin here.

602
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:10,925
- This is amigo.

603
00:40:12,755 --> 00:40:13,583
Your were right.

604
00:40:14,481 --> 00:40:16,241
- [Steve] Then you can help us?

605
00:40:16,241 --> 00:40:17,622
- Carlos can't do much.

606
00:40:20,832 --> 00:40:21,660
- Sorry.

607
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,733
Okay, I'll be down
 in about three days,

608
00:40:25,733 --> 00:40:27,114
in the meantime you
 can get things rolling

609
00:40:27,114 --> 00:40:28,426
with Operation Marine Life.

610
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:31,532
Got everything you need?

611
00:40:31,532 --> 00:40:32,671
- I hope so.

612
00:40:32,671 --> 00:40:34,086
- See you soon, amigo.

613
00:40:34,086 --> 00:40:36,364
- [Al] See you later.

614
00:40:36,364 --> 00:40:38,815
[phone thuds]

615
00:40:57,593 --> 00:40:59,077
[knocking on door]

616
00:40:59,077 --> 00:40:59,871
- Come in.

617
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:02,598
- Jeff.

618
00:41:02,598 --> 00:41:04,116
- [Jeff] What's up, Steve?

619
00:41:04,116 --> 00:41:05,842
- You got a minute?

620
00:41:05,842 --> 00:41:07,050
- Yeah. Come on in.

621
00:41:09,536 --> 00:41:11,261
- What's up, Steve?

622
00:41:11,261 --> 00:41:13,643
- Well, I'm ready to
 put Operation Marine
 Life into action.

623
00:41:13,643 --> 00:41:15,576
- Didn't you just lose an amigo?

624
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:19,028
- Yeah, unfortunately,
 but now his partner

625
00:41:19,028 --> 00:41:20,270
is ready to step in.

626
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:21,962
And that's the guy I
 was telling you about.

627
00:41:21,962 --> 00:41:24,758
- [Jeff] Oh, why don't you
 give it a few days, Steve?

628
00:41:24,758 --> 00:41:26,276
- A few days?

629
00:41:27,346 --> 00:41:29,452
For God sakes, Jeff.

630
00:41:29,452 --> 00:41:31,212
I mean, we're averaging
six OD's a day,

631
00:41:31,212 --> 00:41:32,938
every day, in this
 country alone.

632
00:41:32,938 --> 00:41:35,354
- Steve, all I'm saying to you,

633
00:41:35,354 --> 00:41:36,563
that if you'd like to-

634
00:41:36,563 --> 00:41:38,875
- We're talkin'
 about human lives.

635
00:41:38,875 --> 00:41:41,602
And we can't just sit on
 our butts and do nothin'.

636
00:41:41,602 --> 00:41:43,777
And we gotta at least
 try and put a stop to it.

637
00:41:43,777 --> 00:41:45,433
- But, Steve, all I am saying-

638
00:41:45,433 --> 00:41:46,883
- What's the matter, Jeff,

639
00:41:46,883 --> 00:41:48,471
did you get another
 phone call from upstairs?

640
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:51,474
I thought you were gonna
make those DA big shots

641
00:41:51,474 --> 00:41:53,752
put up or shut up, back
'em up against the wall.

642
00:41:53,752 --> 00:41:56,410
Always had a lot of
 bureaucratic bullshit.

643
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:58,792
- Now listen, Steve, calm down.

644
00:41:58,792 --> 00:41:59,655
Here.

645
00:41:59,655 --> 00:42:00,448
- What's that?

646
00:42:00,448 --> 00:42:01,242
- Take it.

647
00:42:05,557 --> 00:42:07,870
- You're gonna need some
expenses, aren't you?

648
00:42:10,217 --> 00:42:13,876
- Well it's a start, but uh,
 [smirks] it won't be enough.

649
00:42:13,876 --> 00:42:16,050
- [chuckles] It never is.

650
00:42:17,707 --> 00:42:20,607
- You won't regret
 it, Jeff. Thanks.

651
00:42:20,607 --> 00:42:24,093
- And Steve, you'll remember,

652
00:42:24,093 --> 00:42:26,544
I want Thomas
 brought here alive.

653
00:42:27,683 --> 00:42:30,617
I want to take a look
at this son of a bitch.

654
00:42:32,032 --> 00:42:34,828
- You'll see him,
 Jeff, warts and all.

655
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:39,453
[suspenseful music]

656
00:43:17,456 --> 00:43:20,183
[chain clinking]

657
00:43:21,253 --> 00:43:25,085
[suspenseful music continues]

658
00:43:31,022 --> 00:43:31,850
- Melissa?

659
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:36,475
Melissa!

660
00:43:42,136 --> 00:43:43,206
Anybody home?

661
00:43:47,935 --> 00:43:48,764
Melissa!

662
00:43:58,601 --> 00:43:59,429
Melissa!

663
00:43:59,429 --> 00:44:01,984
[birds flutter]

664
00:44:19,898 --> 00:44:21,520
Melissa!
 - Get out of here

665
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,800
or I burn your face
 off, you bastard!

666
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,941
- Excuse me, miss, I'm
 looking for Melissa.

667
00:44:27,941 --> 00:44:29,563
- Are you a friend of her?

668
00:44:29,563 --> 00:44:30,909
- [Paul] Are you her mother?

669
00:44:30,909 --> 00:44:32,152
- Grandmother!

670
00:44:32,152 --> 00:44:33,429
- I'm a friend of
 your granddaughter.

671
00:44:33,429 --> 00:44:36,156
- Let you call yourself
a friend, you bastard!

672
00:44:36,156 --> 00:44:38,986
You and the rest,
 what have you done

673
00:44:38,986 --> 00:44:40,643
with my granddaughter?

674
00:44:40,643 --> 00:44:42,680
- Please, let me explain.

675
00:44:43,784 --> 00:44:44,958
I'm looking for my wife,

676
00:44:44,958 --> 00:44:47,305
and she was very
 friendly with Melissa.

677
00:44:47,305 --> 00:44:49,134
I thought she could
 help me find her.

678
00:44:50,549 --> 00:44:51,447
- You know?

679
00:44:53,794 --> 00:44:56,210
You know what she did to me?

680
00:44:56,210 --> 00:44:58,696
She hit to me, that's what.

681
00:44:59,973 --> 00:45:03,908
Her own grandmother,
 an old woman.

682
00:45:03,908 --> 00:45:05,875
That's not her.

683
00:45:05,875 --> 00:45:07,843
That's not my Melissa.

684
00:45:08,982 --> 00:45:11,294
- Do you know where
 I can find her?

685
00:45:11,294 --> 00:45:15,367
- If she ever comes
 back here, I kill her.

686
00:45:15,367 --> 00:45:17,438
But she's too chicken,

687
00:45:17,438 --> 00:45:19,820
they made her like that.

688
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:21,822
She wasn't chicken before.

689
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:23,721
- Who made her like that?

690
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:24,929
What are their names?

691
00:45:24,929 --> 00:45:28,553
- The junkies of the
 cemetery, that's who.

692
00:45:28,553 --> 00:45:30,728
- Cemetery? What's
 this cemetery?

693
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:34,041
- It's where they
 bury dead people.

694
00:45:34,041 --> 00:45:36,803
It's where the kids are.

695
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,806
And it's called The Cemetery.

696
00:45:40,945 --> 00:45:42,636
- You want me to
 tell her something?

697
00:45:42,636 --> 00:45:44,155
- Yes.

698
00:45:44,155 --> 00:45:47,158
Tell her I said,
 "Go fuck yourself!"

699
00:45:48,607 --> 00:45:51,610
[suspenseful music]

700
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:44,111
- Nice car, cop.

701
00:46:44,111 --> 00:46:45,078
Nice car, cop.

702
00:46:45,078 --> 00:46:46,838
- Look, I'm not a cop.

703
00:46:47,735 --> 00:46:48,978
I'm looking for Melissa.

704
00:46:51,325 --> 00:46:53,569
[kid with white hat speaking
 in foreign language]

705
00:46:53,569 --> 00:46:55,260
- He don't understand.
 - He don't understand.

706
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:56,641
- [Paul] No.

707
00:46:56,641 --> 00:46:58,263
Look, at least-
 - Do we smiley to him?

708
00:46:58,263 --> 00:47:00,956
- Give the a smiley to him!
 - I just-

709
00:47:00,956 --> 00:47:04,683
Come on, man, I just wanna
 talk to Melissa, okay?

710
00:47:04,683 --> 00:47:07,341
- Cops aren't welcome
 here this often.

711
00:47:07,341 --> 00:47:09,827
We got sort of an understanding.

712
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:10,655
- We got sort of
 an understanding.

713
00:47:11,967 --> 00:47:14,314
- Look, I told
 you, I'm not a cop.

714
00:47:14,314 --> 00:47:16,523
- You guys, you
 don't understand.

715
00:47:16,523 --> 00:47:18,801
He's just looking
 for a little action.

716
00:47:18,801 --> 00:47:21,769
- I just want to talk
to Melissa, that's all.

717
00:47:21,769 --> 00:47:23,185
- He's no cop.

718
00:47:23,185 --> 00:47:24,565
- Thank you.

719
00:47:24,565 --> 00:47:28,604
- Cop or no cop, I think
we'll take you down.

720
00:47:28,604 --> 00:47:30,054
- Take him down.

721
00:47:30,054 --> 00:47:32,850
[kids chuckling]

722
00:47:34,437 --> 00:47:36,094
- Go! Go there.
- No.

723
00:47:37,199 --> 00:47:39,546
Come on, please, come on.

724
00:47:39,546 --> 00:47:44,551
[kids chattering]
 [growling]

725
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:48,244
- Let him go, he's
 a friend of mine.

726
00:48:01,671 --> 00:48:03,432
You two, fuck off.

727
00:48:03,432 --> 00:48:06,055
- You're gonna give this
cop a freebie, Melissa?

728
00:48:06,055 --> 00:48:07,850
- A freebie, Melissa.

729
00:48:10,715 --> 00:48:11,543
- Come with me.

730
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:27,145
- Do you know where Alison is?

731
00:48:27,145 --> 00:48:28,802
- Where she is?

732
00:48:28,802 --> 00:48:31,322
- [Paul] She's been
 missing for 17 days.

733
00:48:31,322 --> 00:48:33,393
- I haven't seen her.

734
00:48:33,393 --> 00:48:35,222
I thought she went straight.

735
00:48:35,222 --> 00:48:37,052
I thought that
 she went with you.

736
00:48:37,052 --> 00:48:39,123
- When did you see her last?

737
00:48:39,123 --> 00:48:41,125
- About three weeks ago.

738
00:48:41,125 --> 00:48:44,507
She was with a guy,
 her dealer, I think.

739
00:48:44,507 --> 00:48:47,579
I was high, I don't remember.

740
00:48:47,579 --> 00:48:49,616
- You're dying, Melissa.

741
00:48:49,616 --> 00:48:51,929
- All our lives we're dying.

742
00:48:57,624 --> 00:49:00,213
- Eh! Take it easy.

743
00:49:00,213 --> 00:49:02,870
Who the hell do
 you think you are?

744
00:49:02,870 --> 00:49:05,045
- [Junkie] I'm right here,
 cop, don't get smart.

745
00:49:05,045 --> 00:49:07,945
[knocking on window]

746
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,015
Don't get smart, cop.

747
00:49:10,188 --> 00:49:12,950
- You're right, you
 don't understand.

748
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:15,573
[suspenseful music]

749
00:49:15,573 --> 00:49:19,266
Do you know why we
call this The Dead Bus?

750
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:23,822
Because, one day, it was
driving some little kids

751
00:49:23,822 --> 00:49:26,377
to school, no traffic, no rain,

752
00:49:28,655 --> 00:49:31,313
and just like that,
 for no reason,

753
00:49:31,313 --> 00:49:33,901
it ran over into this turnover,

754
00:49:36,387 --> 00:49:39,459
and all the little
 kids go to heaven.

755
00:49:41,185 --> 00:49:43,601
You know what they found out?

756
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:46,880
The driver didn't stop.

757
00:49:48,813 --> 00:49:53,818
He was high, the
motherfucker. [sobbing]

758
00:49:55,233 --> 00:49:58,926
And one of those little
kids was my own son.

759
00:50:02,102 --> 00:50:03,966
The man was high, see?

760
00:50:06,727 --> 00:50:10,007
[Melissa sighs]
 [Melissa sobbing]

761
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:13,803
Come on, I take you
 to Allyson place.

762
00:50:13,803 --> 00:50:15,667
- [Paul] What do you
 mean, Allyson's place?

763
00:50:15,667 --> 00:50:17,083
- [Melissa] We
 all have a coffin.

764
00:50:17,083 --> 00:50:17,945
- [Paul] A coffin?

765
00:50:17,945 --> 00:50:18,981
- A car.

766
00:50:18,981 --> 00:50:21,018
It wasn't like her to show us.

767
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:22,536
Maybe she left something.

768
00:50:49,494 --> 00:50:51,427
It's the best car.

769
00:50:51,427 --> 00:50:53,740
Allyson has expensive taste.

770
00:50:56,225 --> 00:50:58,986
[paper rustling]

771
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:02,024
- "At the night's end,

772
00:51:02,024 --> 00:51:06,960
that's when my dreams become
 too much [indistinct]."

773
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:15,141
[pole clanging]

774
00:51:15,141 --> 00:51:16,452
[tense music]

775
00:51:16,452 --> 00:51:17,281
Ugh!

776
00:51:19,904 --> 00:51:21,008
Ugh! Allyson!

777
00:51:23,563 --> 00:51:25,668
[Junkie barking]

778
00:51:25,668 --> 00:51:28,326
[Paul retching]

779
00:51:35,713 --> 00:51:38,371
[Paul retching]

780
00:51:42,271 --> 00:51:43,928
- His name!

781
00:51:43,928 --> 00:51:44,929
The dealer!

782
00:51:44,929 --> 00:51:46,448
- No.

783
00:51:46,448 --> 00:51:49,140
- Melissa, he killed her!

784
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:51,660
- Okay, I take you there.

785
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:54,835
[junkie barking]

786
00:51:54,835 --> 00:51:56,458
- Hey.

787
00:51:56,458 --> 00:51:58,045
Melissa!

788
00:51:58,045 --> 00:51:59,495
Melissa!

789
00:51:59,495 --> 00:52:01,773
You are fucking
 crazy! Come back!

790
00:52:01,773 --> 00:52:03,223
- You fucking better come back.

791
00:52:03,223 --> 00:52:05,536
- Did you see what
 they did to Allyson?

792
00:52:05,536 --> 00:52:07,124
- She was fucking around!

793
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:08,021
- Fucking around!

794
00:52:12,439 --> 00:52:13,716
[Junkie] Melissa,
 you're fucking crazy.

795
00:52:13,716 --> 00:52:15,201
Come back here.

796
00:52:15,201 --> 00:52:18,204
[suspenseful music]

797
00:52:23,864 --> 00:52:26,419
[engine roars]

798
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:31,872
[truck clanking]

799
00:52:36,222 --> 00:52:38,707
- Uh, yes, uh, chief.

800
00:52:38,707 --> 00:52:41,330
Yes, uh.

801
00:52:41,330 --> 00:52:44,368
No, ballistics was very firm.

802
00:52:44,368 --> 00:52:47,336
Seven shots, three
 different guns.

803
00:52:48,544 --> 00:52:50,201
I said three. Right.

804
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:58,002
It seem unlikely, it was
 two guys who found the body.

805
00:52:59,314 --> 00:53:02,282
Three guns, and only two guys.

806
00:53:06,424 --> 00:53:10,635
- You mean one of
 them had two guns

807
00:53:10,635 --> 00:53:13,328
and found them both
 at the same time.

808
00:53:15,951 --> 00:53:20,956
Excuse me, chief, this was
 a drunk and an old sailor.

809
00:53:21,819 --> 00:53:23,338
- We have motive for theft.

810
00:53:23,338 --> 00:53:24,925
One of the guns.

811
00:53:24,925 --> 00:53:27,825
The knife they actually
 used to cut off the finger.

812
00:53:27,825 --> 00:53:29,240
We got opportunity.

813
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:31,277
They were with the body.

814
00:53:31,277 --> 00:53:34,728
As for the guns, maybe there
 was a third accomplice.

815
00:53:34,728 --> 00:53:36,420
- [Badal] I suppose
 it's possible.

816
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:38,422
- The evidence is
 all there, Badal.

817
00:53:38,422 --> 00:53:40,009
Now let the courts
 do their duty.

818
00:53:40,009 --> 00:53:41,528
- [Badal] But I can't consent.

819
00:53:41,528 --> 00:53:45,256
- Detective, your consent
 doesn't come in to it,

820
00:53:45,256 --> 00:53:48,984
anymore than it did when you
 committed statutory rape.

821
00:53:48,984 --> 00:53:51,089
Now, I have done
 all I can to keep

822
00:53:51,089 --> 00:53:53,437
that quiet for
 you, because I hate

823
00:53:53,437 --> 00:53:56,163
to see a man's career
 go down the drain

824
00:53:56,163 --> 00:53:58,787
over some silly
 misunderstanding.

825
00:53:58,787 --> 00:54:01,238
But if you can't put
 away two suspects

826
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:04,482
with all this evidence,
I'm wondering,

827
00:54:04,482 --> 00:54:06,001
what could your career-

828
00:54:06,001 --> 00:54:06,933
- Yeah, chief.

829
00:54:08,417 --> 00:54:11,696
All right, I understand.

830
00:54:11,696 --> 00:54:13,146
I stay in line.

831
00:54:13,146 --> 00:54:15,286
- Badal, I can sympathize
 with your attraction

832
00:54:15,286 --> 00:54:18,669
for school girls, but you
 don't have to act like one.

833
00:54:18,669 --> 00:54:20,809
Look, I tell you what, why
 don't we just forget about it?

834
00:54:20,809 --> 00:54:22,811
Goodbye.
 - Wait, don't hang up.

835
00:54:24,191 --> 00:54:26,366
I think I see your logic.

836
00:54:26,366 --> 00:54:27,850
I'll do the necessary.

837
00:54:27,850 --> 00:54:30,646
- We got a tough job
 ahead of us, Badal.

838
00:54:30,646 --> 00:54:34,340
I know I can count on you
 to help restore confidence,

839
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:36,963
to handle all the
 attacks of the press,

840
00:54:36,963 --> 00:54:39,276
even from their own minister.

841
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:41,864
We have all the hard problems.

842
00:54:41,864 --> 00:54:45,074
Drugs, murder, rape.

843
00:54:45,074 --> 00:54:47,698
- They have brought it
 for you [indistinct]

844
00:54:47,698 --> 00:54:49,251
- Drugs

845
00:54:49,251 --> 00:54:53,013
- That's nice, you don't
have to worry about me.

846
00:54:53,013 --> 00:54:54,670
[lips smacking]

847
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:55,740
- You want the car, or money?

848
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:58,018
- Yes.
- Both.

849
00:54:58,018 --> 00:54:59,951
- [chuckles] I always
 said I'm smart, daddy.

850
00:54:59,951 --> 00:55:01,159
- Where are you going?

851
00:55:02,126 --> 00:55:03,886
- Out with friends.

852
00:55:03,886 --> 00:55:05,302
- What happened to
 what's his name?

853
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:06,475
- What's his name was a jerk.

854
00:55:06,475 --> 00:55:08,995
[car keys jingling]
 [Lupita giggles]

855
00:55:08,995 --> 00:55:10,272
- Ah, Lupita.

856
00:55:10,272 --> 00:55:11,100
- Yes?

857
00:55:12,239 --> 00:55:13,448
- May I talk to you
 about something?

858
00:55:13,448 --> 00:55:14,311
- Sure.

859
00:55:16,209 --> 00:55:18,901
- You don't ever fool
 around with drugs, do you?

860
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:23,975
- Drugs users are stupid little
people with no imagination.

861
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:27,289
- I'm relieved to hear you say.

862
00:55:27,289 --> 00:55:29,705
- How can I do
 something so stupid

863
00:55:29,705 --> 00:55:31,431
when I have everything I want?

864
00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:35,159
And a father who
 loves me so much.

865
00:55:38,507 --> 00:55:41,510
[people chattering]

866
00:55:42,477 --> 00:55:44,996
[phone slams]

867
00:56:01,323 --> 00:56:03,429
[sirens wailing]

868
00:56:03,429 --> 00:56:04,326
- Nobody here?

869
00:56:05,327 --> 00:56:06,259
- I'm here.

870
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:09,158
- I mean, no one else?

871
00:56:10,643 --> 00:56:11,954
- Disturbances.

872
00:56:11,954 --> 00:56:13,128
- Huh?

873
00:56:13,128 --> 00:56:14,992
- At the demonstration.

874
00:56:14,992 --> 00:56:17,235
I'm holding down the fort.

875
00:56:17,235 --> 00:56:20,687
- Ah.

876
00:56:20,687 --> 00:56:24,657
- I just sort of spoke
 with the chief of police.

877
00:56:24,657 --> 00:56:25,485
- I know.

878
00:56:26,762 --> 00:56:27,694
- You know?

879
00:56:27,694 --> 00:56:29,386
- You left the door open.

880
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:31,698
- You heard everything?

881
00:56:31,698 --> 00:56:33,217
- [Al] Everything.

882
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:37,670
- Are you going to report me?

883
00:56:37,670 --> 00:56:40,189
- To who? The chief of police?

884
00:56:41,915 --> 00:56:43,814
- I'm ashamed of this, Al.

885
00:56:43,814 --> 00:56:44,780
- Good for you.

886
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:46,920
- Say what you're thinking.

887
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:48,715
I'm correct, it's allowed.

888
00:56:48,715 --> 00:56:50,234
- That's what I used to think.

889
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:53,168
Now I just think
 you're an asshole.

890
00:56:54,618 --> 00:56:56,654
- They got me by the balls.

891
00:56:58,104 --> 00:57:00,451
- Everybody knows
 about the girl, Badal.

892
00:57:02,211 --> 00:57:06,008
And everyone knows
 who raped who.

893
00:57:06,008 --> 00:57:07,976
- She was a minor.

894
00:57:07,976 --> 00:57:09,460
- She was a whore.

895
00:57:13,015 --> 00:57:14,879
- Everyone knows.

896
00:57:14,879 --> 00:57:16,363
- You're an idiot.

897
00:57:16,363 --> 00:57:18,504
You're so busy trying
 to save your arse,

898
00:57:18,504 --> 00:57:21,817
you don't even notice when
 they cut off your balls.

899
00:57:24,302 --> 00:57:26,339
- I have got a wife.

900
00:57:26,339 --> 00:57:27,547
Two kids.

901
00:57:27,547 --> 00:57:29,515
- And what do the kids
 think of their dad?

902
00:57:30,999 --> 00:57:32,069
- What can I do?

903
00:57:32,069 --> 00:57:35,037
- One, you don't
frame those guys

904
00:57:35,037 --> 00:57:36,453
for a murder they didn't do.

905
00:57:37,971 --> 00:57:42,631
And two, show up
 tomorrow morning at
 Maria Mendoza's house.

906
00:57:43,736 --> 00:57:44,771

908
00:57:48,395 --> 00:57:51,226
- Maria. How are you holding up?

909
00:57:53,435 --> 00:57:54,954
Our friend arrives tomorrow.

910
00:57:56,162 --> 00:57:58,095
Can we meet at your house?

911
00:57:58,095 --> 00:58:00,097
Okay. See you then.

00:58:04,619 --> 00:58:05,516
10 o'clock.

913
00:58:15,146 --> 00:58:16,527
I'll just be a minute.

914
00:58:16,527 --> 00:58:18,011
Please take this.

915
00:58:18,011 --> 00:58:21,014

Please!

918
00:58:33,958 --> 00:58:36,374
Mr. Paul Boles, please.

919
00:58:36,374 --> 00:58:38,618
- Mr. Paul Boles has
 just left, officer.

920
00:58:38,618 --> 00:58:39,999
- Did he get my messages?

921
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:41,276
- If you left him a message,

922
00:58:41,276 --> 00:58:42,864
I'm sure he would
 have received it,

923
00:58:42,864 --> 00:58:45,798
or we'll receive
 it and carry it on.

924
00:58:45,798 --> 00:58:48,525
- What kind of
 crappy hotel is this?

925
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:49,802
- Please, officer.

926
00:58:50,975 --> 00:58:52,839
He just came in a
 few minutes ago,

927
00:58:52,839 --> 00:58:54,634
but he went out
 again right away.

928
00:58:54,634 --> 00:58:57,534
He had a lady waiting
 for him in the car.

929
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,018
I told him I had messages,

930
00:58:59,018 --> 00:59:02,193
but he evidently didn't
 want to keep her waiting.

931
00:59:02,193 --> 00:59:04,471
- Did you get a
 look at the lady?

932
00:59:04,471 --> 00:59:07,474
- She was rather rough looking.

933
00:59:08,579 --> 00:59:12,031
Bold hair, hot pants,
 uh, like a tiger.

934
00:59:12,031 --> 00:59:13,964
- Okay. Thanks.

935
00:59:13,964 --> 00:59:16,414

938
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:57,110

939
01:00:00,113 --> 01:00:00,942
- Are you sure?

940
01:00:00,942 --> 01:00:02,150
- Of course.

941
01:00:02,150 --> 01:00:04,221
Every night he's
whoring, fucking around

942
01:00:04,221 --> 01:00:06,741
and marketing his shit in clubs.

943
01:00:06,741 --> 01:00:09,295
Now he's going to
 the Tobacco Garden.

944
01:00:09,295 --> 01:00:11,159
They call him "The Cowboy."

945
01:00:11,159 --> 01:00:13,437
- But you're sure?
 - He's other name is Ilrosso.

946
01:00:13,437 --> 01:00:16,613
I'm sure, I introduced
 him to Allyson.

949
01:00:22,308 --> 01:00:24,690
What are you doing with that?

950
01:00:26,899 --> 01:00:31,628
- [breathing heavily]
 What do you think?

951
01:00:38,289 --> 01:00:39,359
- Paul! Wait!

952
01:00:41,051 --> 01:00:42,880
What are you doing? Wait!

953
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:45,642

- Hey! Who are you?

957
01:01:32,550 --> 01:01:35,553
- [inhales] I'm
 Allyson's husband.

958
01:01:35,553 --> 01:01:36,485

984
01:03:03,227 --> 01:03:06,852
Melissa, what the fuck
 is wrong with you?

985
01:03:06,852 --> 01:03:08,198

986
01:03:08,198 --> 01:03:10,303

01:03:10,303 --> 01:03:11,546
Bitch!

01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:14,652
- He killed The
 Cowboy, I saw him.

990
01:03:14,652 --> 01:03:16,344

[glass shattering]

1012
01:05:24,265 --> 01:05:26,750
- A couple of more
minutes with those guys,

1013
01:05:26,750 --> 01:05:29,028
I'd be scraping you
 off the sidewalk.

1014
01:05:30,754 --> 01:05:32,273
- I might have been better off.

1015
01:05:35,207 --> 01:05:37,243
What are the prisons
 like in this country?

1016
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:40,143
- Hell.

1017
01:05:40,143 --> 01:05:41,040
They're like hell.

[handcuffs clinking]

1023

I'm Maria Mendoza.

- Maria, pleasure.

1028
01:06:49,591 --> 01:06:50,523
- Hello, amigo.

1029
01:06:50,523 --> 01:06:52,870
- Hi, Al, good to see you.

1030
01:06:52,870 --> 01:06:54,631
- This is Paul Boles,

1031
01:06:54,631 --> 01:06:55,839
I told you about him.

1032
01:06:55,839 --> 01:06:56,667
- Ah.

1033
01:06:59,118 --> 01:07:00,119
Paul, how are you?

1034
01:07:01,603 --> 01:07:04,158
I understand to got yourself
 a little scrape last night.

1035
01:07:05,331 --> 01:07:06,401
- I found the dead
 body of my wife

1036
01:07:06,401 --> 01:07:07,609
in the trunk of a car.

1037
01:07:08,852 --> 01:07:11,406
I tracked down the drug
deal who killed her.

1038
01:07:11,406 --> 01:07:12,545
Slash his throat.

1039
01:07:13,719 --> 01:07:15,686
And got beat practically
to death by his goons

1040
01:07:15,686 --> 01:07:17,067
when they caught up with me.

1041
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:21,865
- Uh, would anyone
 want some coffee?

1042
01:07:22,935 --> 01:07:25,351
- Oh, yes. Thanks, Maria.

1043
01:07:25,351 --> 01:07:26,180
- Sit down.

1044
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:33,704
- Is Inspector
 Badal gonna join us?

1045
01:07:33,704 --> 01:07:34,981
- I hope so.

1046
01:07:34,981 --> 01:07:36,224
- It takes a lotta
 guts to go through

1047
01:07:36,224 --> 01:07:37,605
with a decision like that.

1048
01:07:38,502 --> 01:07:40,608
We'd better start without him.

1049
01:07:40,608 --> 01:07:41,574
- [Al] He's basically a good-

1050
01:07:41,574 --> 01:07:43,404
- Al, we'll go without him.

1051
01:07:44,612 --> 01:07:47,580
Now, as you know, the
 idea is to concentrate

1052
01:07:47,580 --> 01:07:50,238
on the three main targets.

1053
01:07:50,238 --> 01:07:51,860
I don't want anybody distracted

1054
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:53,966
by some nickel
 and dime bag type,

1055
01:07:55,105 --> 01:07:57,314
even though we have very
good personal reasons

1056
01:07:57,314 --> 01:07:58,591
to go after them.

1057
01:07:58,591 --> 01:07:59,523
Understood?

1058
01:08:01,111 --> 01:08:06,116
- So, there's Don Thomas,
 the chief of the police,

1059
01:08:07,290 --> 01:08:08,705
and the bank guy,
 what's his name?

1060
01:08:08,705 --> 01:08:12,053
- Luis Betancourt, president
 of The Central Bank.

1061
01:08:12,053 --> 01:08:15,194
They call him Bleach, because
 he leaves grimy drug money

1062
01:08:15,194 --> 01:08:16,782
smelling clean and fresh.

1063
01:08:16,782 --> 01:08:19,440
- You know, once we put
this plan into action,

1064
01:08:20,268 --> 01:08:21,476
there's no turnin' back.

1065
01:08:22,995 --> 01:08:26,861
I wanna be sure that you're
 all in this to the end.

1066
01:08:26,861 --> 01:08:28,759
Have you got any doubts,

1067
01:08:28,759 --> 01:08:31,831
anybody wants out,
 now's the time.

1068
01:08:31,831 --> 01:08:32,763
Maria?

1069
01:08:32,763 --> 01:08:34,144
- I'm in.

1070
01:08:34,144 --> 01:08:35,111
- Al?

1071
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:36,595
- You know how I feel about it.

1072
01:08:38,217 --> 01:08:39,218
- Paul?
 - I'll do whatever

1073
01:08:39,218 --> 01:08:42,290
you tell me, and
I'll die trying.

1074
01:08:42,290 --> 01:08:44,568
- Now, we've gotta act fast.

1075
01:08:44,568 --> 01:08:47,744
Romero and this Betancourt,
 they're no problem.

1076
01:08:48,641 --> 01:08:51,541
But as to Don Thomas, he's mine.

1077
01:08:52,921 --> 01:08:55,510
I plan on taking him back alive.

1078
01:08:55,510 --> 01:08:57,133
- To the States?

1079
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:58,927
[scoffs] You can just walk in

1080
01:08:58,927 --> 01:08:59,859
and take him out alive.

1081
01:08:59,859 --> 01:09:01,309
I mean, this guy's got more cops

1082
01:09:01,309 --> 01:09:03,346
and bodyguards than
 President Bush.

1083
01:09:03,346 --> 01:09:04,864
- Yeah, I know.

1084
01:09:04,864 --> 01:09:07,591
But he's also got a daughter
 he loves more than money.

1085
01:09:08,661 --> 01:09:09,904
A daughter I
 understand that runs

1086
01:09:09,904 --> 01:09:11,975
around a lot without bodyguards.

1087
01:09:13,252 --> 01:09:14,219
Okay.

1088
01:09:14,219 --> 01:09:17,153

[gun snaps]

1090
01:09:27,266 --> 01:09:29,579
- I'm sorry I'm late.

1091
01:09:29,579 --> 01:09:32,306
I had something to take care of.

1092
01:09:32,306 --> 01:09:37,311

01:10:37,198 --> 01:10:38,993
- Wanna take a walk?

1095
01:10:38,993 --> 01:10:40,512
- If you want to.

1096

[tense music]

1098
01:11:09,644 --> 01:11:12,302
My father didn't want me
to take the convertible,

1099
01:11:12,302 --> 01:11:14,339
I was pissed off.

1100
01:11:14,339 --> 01:11:16,962
But you know, it's nice.

1101
01:11:16,962 --> 01:11:18,239
In private.

1102
01:11:18,239 --> 01:11:21,553
[tense music continues]

1103
01:11:23,486 --> 01:11:24,659

[pistol thuds]
 [guy in car groans]

1105
01:11:25,902 --> 01:11:30,147

 blow your brains out.

[gentle guitar music]

1109
01:11:41,849 --> 01:11:45,439
- There's a girl who
 knows what she wants.

1110
01:11:45,439 --> 01:11:47,061
- What about you?

1111
01:11:47,061 --> 01:11:48,545
You know what you want?

1112
01:11:48,545 --> 01:11:49,408
- No!

1113
01:11:49,408 --> 01:11:50,927

1115
01:12:00,039 --> 01:12:02,421
- [sighs] What is it?

1116
01:12:02,421 --> 01:12:04,112
- [Chucho] I'm sorry
 to disturb you,

1117
01:12:04,112 --> 01:12:05,976
but there's an urgent call.

1118
01:12:05,976 --> 01:12:08,324
- Are you crazy, it's
the middle of the night.

1119
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:11,672
- [Chucho] It's
 from your daughter.

1120
01:12:11,672 --> 01:12:15,883
[suspenseful music continues]

1121
01:12:15,883 --> 01:12:17,056
- She's not back yet?

1122
01:12:17,056 --> 01:12:18,644
- [Chucho] No, sir.

1123
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:23,304
- Put the call through.

1124
01:12:25,479 --> 01:12:27,481
- [Male voice] Don Thomas?

1125
01:12:27,481 --> 01:12:29,034
- Yes.

1126
01:12:29,034 --> 01:12:33,521
- [Male voice] Lupita was
 driving the sedan tonight.

1127
01:12:33,521 --> 01:12:35,005
- Who is this?

1128
01:12:35,005 --> 01:12:37,353
- [Male voice] If you
 want to see her again,

1129
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:39,424
you'll follow our orders.

1130
01:12:41,218 --> 01:12:43,635
- What orders?
- Calling back at noon.

1131
01:12:43,635 --> 01:12:45,361
Call the police if you like,

1132
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:48,640
it won't make any difference.

1133
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:51,228

1134
01:12:53,852 --> 01:12:55,267

Chucho!

1136
01:12:57,821 --> 01:12:58,926

1137
01:12:58,926 --> 01:13:00,928

[tape ripping]

1141
01:14:06,718 --> 01:14:08,858
- Did you wanna say something?

1142
01:14:08,858 --> 01:14:11,170
- Why don't you untie my hands,

1143
01:14:11,170 --> 01:14:15,278
I can do incredible
 things with my hands.

1144
01:14:15,278 --> 01:14:17,522
- And what about your mouth?

1145
01:14:17,522 --> 01:14:18,868
- Yes, that too.

1146
01:14:21,353 --> 01:14:25,253
I can show you a good
 time while we're waiting.

1147
01:14:28,809 --> 01:14:31,846
- That sounds very
 exciting, Lupita.

1148
01:14:31,846 --> 01:14:35,091
- Ah, come on, untie my hands.

1149
01:14:35,091 --> 01:14:39,613
Anyway, my father won't let
 me stay here too much longer.

1150
01:14:39,613 --> 01:14:41,580
- You know what, Lupita?

1151
01:14:41,580 --> 01:14:42,443
- What?

1152
01:14:43,927 --> 01:14:46,896
- Save it for someone
 who appreciate you.

1153
01:14:46,896 --> 01:14:47,724
- Bastard!

1154
01:14:50,140 --> 01:14:52,557
- No, your father's the bastard.

1155
01:14:52,557 --> 01:14:53,903
That's why you're here.

1156
01:14:56,906 --> 01:14:58,355
But if you have to
 go to the bathroom,

1157
01:14:58,355 --> 01:15:01,358
just bang your head against
 the wall three times.

1158
01:15:02,359 --> 01:15:05,846

[knocking on glass]

1160
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:28,731

[ball whirrs]

1162
01:15:36,808 --> 01:15:38,085
- Thomas Radeck, please.

1163
01:15:40,156 --> 01:15:42,054
If you would like to see
 your daughter alive again,

1164
01:15:42,054 --> 01:15:45,402
be at the opera house
 tonight at 10 o'clock,

1165
01:15:45,402 --> 01:15:47,473
you'll receive
 further instructions.

1166
01:15:51,443 --> 01:15:52,513

[phone slams]

1168
01:15:55,136 --> 01:15:58,174
- It was too short,
 I couldn't trace it.

1169
01:15:58,174 --> 01:15:59,002
- Fuck me.

1170
01:16:00,866 --> 01:16:02,350
Who could it be,
 what do they want?

1171
01:16:02,350 --> 01:16:03,904
- We'll get them, we've
 got the whole police force.

1172
01:16:03,904 --> 01:16:05,146
- Well, whoever they are,

1173
01:16:05,146 --> 01:16:06,976
they certainly knew
 how to get to me.

1174
01:16:22,681 --> 01:16:24,614
- We have to see
 the chief of police,

1175
01:16:24,614 --> 01:16:26,340
it's an emergency.

1176
01:16:26,340 --> 01:16:29,343
[people chattering]

1177
01:16:30,931 --> 01:16:33,278
- Sir.
- Captain Badal.

1178
01:16:33,278 --> 01:16:34,486
The police chief box.

1179
01:16:34,486 --> 01:16:36,074

- What the hell
 are you doing here,

1183
01:17:09,141 --> 01:17:10,660
I told you to watch the hall.

1184
01:17:11,903 --> 01:17:14,699
- Come on, go in the hall!
 - Okay, sir.

[gun fires]
 [people screaming]

1196
01:19:14,577 --> 01:19:15,785
- Don't go out.

1197

- I want to know
 what's happening!

1198
01:19:16,475 --> 01:19:17,235
- Don Thomas.

1199
01:19:18,477 --> 01:19:20,272
They killed the chief of police.

1200
01:19:20,272 --> 01:19:21,377
He's knifed.

We don't want
 money, we want you.

1204
01:19:33,078 --> 01:19:36,012
Follow instructions you
will receive at dawn

1205
01:19:36,012 --> 01:19:39,775
or your daughter
 comes back in pieces."

[tense music]

1207
01:19:45,470 --> 01:19:47,990
- [Paul] It's a little
 strange, isn't it?

1208
01:19:47,990 --> 01:19:50,820
We're gonna kill someone
who we don't even know.

1209
01:19:50,820 --> 01:19:52,132
- Did you know The Cowboy?

1210
01:19:53,754 --> 01:19:54,582
- I don't know.

1211
01:19:55,963 --> 01:19:57,275
He reminds me of somebody.

1212
01:19:58,690 --> 01:20:01,348
- Look, this guy kills people
 he doesn't know everyday.

1213
01:20:01,348 --> 01:20:02,867
Kids.

1214
01:20:02,867 --> 01:20:05,110
Without him all this drug
 money would just be paper.

1215
01:20:07,630 --> 01:20:12,290
- My friend. They
 killed my friend.

1216
01:20:12,290 --> 01:20:17,295
[indistinct mumbling]
He was such a nice guy.

1217
01:20:17,882 --> 01:20:19,366
- Come on.

1218
01:20:19,366 --> 01:20:23,197
- They killed my friend.

1219
01:20:23,197 --> 01:20:28,202
They killed my friend.

1220
01:20:41,284 --> 01:20:43,010
My friend. My friend.

01:20:44,046 --> 01:20:49,016
My friend. What?

1222
01:20:49,810 --> 01:20:51,363
We are being followed.

1223
01:20:52,813 --> 01:20:53,987
- It's a police car.

1224
01:21:08,415 --> 01:21:12,039
- Hi, thanks for seeing us home.

1225
01:21:12,039 --> 01:21:13,006

- I never felt so powerless.

1234
01:21:57,188 --> 01:21:58,465
- We'll get them.

1235
01:21:58,465 --> 01:21:59,155
- We don't even
 know who they are.

1236
01:22:01,882 --> 01:22:02,710
They competition?

1237
01:22:03,677 --> 01:22:04,920
Politics, maybe.

1238
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:06,128
- [Chucho] We'll
 know soon enough.

1239
01:22:06,128 --> 01:22:07,060
- Will you stop
 talking like that!

1240
01:22:07,060 --> 01:22:08,475
My daughter's life is at stake.

1241
01:22:12,617 --> 01:22:14,584
If it's me they want,
 it's me they'll get.

1242
01:22:14,584 --> 01:22:15,654
- You can't do that.

1243
01:22:15,654 --> 01:22:16,483
- You watch me.

We have killed two
 of your friends.

Yes.

I'd like to speak with
 officer Al Romero, please.

How are you feeling, Mr. Boles?

- No, there's nothing new.

1271
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:53,191
We're doing the best we can.

Okay. 10 o'clock would be best.

1273
01:24:55,607 --> 01:24:56,712
See you. Bye.

1274

It was what's his name? Boles.

1275
01:25:01,751 --> 01:25:04,168
The guy with the
 wife by the junkyard.

1276

We're doing everything
 by the book.

[suspenseful music]

1281
01:25:24,084 --> 01:25:25,258
- Without him we're finished,

1282
01:25:25,258 --> 01:25:26,569
we can't let him
 go through with it.

1283

Keep it safe, when the
 car stops get ready.

1284
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:32,299
The tracking signal's already
 planted under the dashboard.

- [Chucho] My girlfriend.

1288

 had a girlfriend.

separate from my personal life.

1290

There are the weapons.

1295
01:25:57,497 --> 01:25:59,119
And I hope you don't
 have to use 'em all.

1296
01:25:59,119 --> 01:26:00,914

 all this stuff.

1297
01:26:03,158 --> 01:26:04,193

1298
01:26:04,193 --> 01:26:05,056

 how you're planning

1301
01:26:15,618 --> 01:26:17,517
to get Don Thomas
 back to the States?

1302
01:26:17,517 --> 01:26:19,450
- At least as far as
 the Mexican border.

1303
01:26:19,450 --> 01:26:21,521
- What are the prisons
 like in the States?

1304
01:26:21,521 --> 01:26:22,453
- Not too pleasant.

1305
01:26:23,385 --> 01:26:24,627
With any kinda luck at all,

1306
01:26:24,627 --> 01:26:26,111
he'll spend the rest
 of his life in prison.

1307

[suspenseful music continues]

1309
01:26:32,532 --> 01:26:33,360

- You all right?

1311
01:26:37,675 --> 01:26:39,435
- I was just thinking.

1312
01:26:39,435 --> 01:26:40,264
- About Carlos?

1313
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:43,922
I was just thinking
 about Allyson.

[suspenseful music continues]

1315
01:26:55,002 --> 01:26:56,556
- Let me go instead of you.

1316
01:26:57,488 --> 01:26:58,799
- No, Chucho, it wouldn't work.

1317
01:26:58,799 --> 01:26:59,973
- What could they want?

1318
01:27:04,115 --> 01:27:05,358
- I suppose they
want to kill me.

1319
01:27:05,358 --> 01:27:06,221
- They won't.

1320
01:27:07,532 --> 01:27:08,947
- Don't do anything foolish.

1321
01:27:10,052 --> 01:27:11,364
I could mean Lupita's life.

1322
01:27:11,364 --> 01:27:12,813
- Yeah, what about your life?

1323
01:27:14,746 --> 01:27:16,507
- Haven't you ever loved anyone?

1324
01:27:17,577 --> 01:27:19,234
What if it were your girlfriend?

1325
01:27:19,234 --> 01:27:20,511
What if it were her?
 - Right.

 to the Sierra Bridge.

1332

- Don Thomas.

1339
01:28:35,171 --> 01:28:37,139
You and your man
 will leave the car

1340
01:28:37,139 --> 01:28:39,452
and walk slowly to the
 middle of the bridge.

1341
01:28:39,452 --> 01:28:42,178
That's where the
 exchange will take place.

1342
01:28:42,178 --> 01:28:43,559
Don't try anything foolish.

1343
01:28:44,664 --> 01:28:46,562
There's a rifle trained
on your daughter.

1344
01:28:50,014 --> 01:28:51,118

You sure you wanna
 do this, inspector?

1353

 an old friend of mine.

- I used to be you puppet.

1361
01:31:03,492 --> 01:31:06,599

 running zigzag.
