00:01:40,999 --> 00:01:42,998
Hey. Hey.

24
00:01:42,999 --> 00:01:44,998
Did you guys see how many
new followers we have?

25
00:01:44,999 --> 00:01:47,998
112 since Friday. 114, actually.

26
00:01:47,999 --> 00:01:49,998
That makes a total of 2,763.

27
00:01:49,999 --> 00:01:51,999
And did you see how many
re-tweets we got yesterday?

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,998
People love pranks that
involve authority figures.

29
00:01:54,999 --> 00:01:56,999
Then they're gonna love today's.

30
00:02:08,999 --> 00:02:12,998
What is that?

31
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:13,998
Ian?

32
00:02:13,999 --> 00:02:15,999
I don't know.

33
00:02:17,999 --> 00:02:19,999
Bro, your backpack.

34
00:02:25,999 --> 00:02:28,998
Great joke, Ian.
Back to the test.

35
00:02:28,999 --> 00:02:31,999
I didn't do it, Mr. Brixton.

36
00:03:07,999 --> 00:03:10,998
All right, laugh away.
Ha, ha, ha.

37
00:03:10,999 --> 00:03:13,998
It's not that funny.

38
00:03:13,999 --> 00:03:15,998
Oh, my God.

39
00:03:15,999 --> 00:03:17,998
This is going to be
great for the blog.

40
00:03:17,999 --> 00:03:19,998
Our followers will love it.

41
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:22,998
Brilliant. This is perfect.

42
00:03:22,999 --> 00:03:25,998
Send it to me,
and I'll upload it later.

43
00:03:25,999 --> 00:03:27,999
See you tonight, Kaylie.

44
00:03:33,999 --> 00:03:35,998
Come here. You guys
have to see this.

45
00:03:35,999 --> 00:03:38,998
This is awesome.

46
00:03:38,999 --> 00:03:41,998
BeautifulAndLovelyBrides.com.

47
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:43,998
Mail-order brides.

48
00:03:43,999 --> 00:03:46,998
They're from, like, every
country on the planet.

49
00:03:46,999 --> 00:03:49,998
Click on that one.

50
00:03:49,999 --> 00:03:51,998
Hmm. She's from Latvia.

51
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:53,998
Nice bikini.

52
00:03:53,999 --> 00:03:55,998
You're a snob.

53
00:03:55,999 --> 00:03:58,998
"Interested in a man

54
00:03:58,999 --> 00:04:00,998
"30 to 60 years old.

55
00:04:00,999 --> 00:04:04,998
"My friends describe me
as creative, shy,

56
00:04:04,999 --> 00:04:07,998
understanding, and cheerful."

57
00:04:07,999 --> 00:04:09,998
Read her hobbies.

58
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:12,998
"Gardening, housekeeping,

59
00:04:12,999 --> 00:04:15,998
listening to pop
music, and exercise."

60
00:04:15,999 --> 00:04:19,998
This is hilarious!
Housekeeping is her hobby?

61
00:04:19,999 --> 00:04:21,999
That can't be true.

62
00:04:23,999 --> 00:04:25,998
Can you guys imagine
what kind of guys

63
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:28,998
have to basically order
a wife on a website?

64
00:04:28,999 --> 00:04:30,999
There are how many
women in America,

65
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,998
and none of them will date you?

66
00:04:32,999 --> 00:04:35,998
Yeah, but these guys
don't want American women.

67
00:04:35,999 --> 00:04:38,998
They want women that they can

68
00:04:38,999 --> 00:04:40,998
treat like slaves.

69
00:04:40,999 --> 00:04:42,998
You don't know that. Yes, I do.

70
00:04:42,999 --> 00:04:44,998
Half these women
don't even speak English.

71
00:04:44,999 --> 00:04:46,998
Please don't tell me
you feel sorry

72
00:04:46,999 --> 00:04:48,998
for the losers trying
to buy a wife online.

73
00:04:48,999 --> 00:04:51,998
If you want to feel bad for
someone, feel bad for these girls.

74
00:04:51,999 --> 00:04:53,998
They have no idea
what they're getting into.

75
00:04:53,999 --> 00:04:56,998
There's one in particular

76
00:04:56,999 --> 00:04:58,998
you need to see.

77
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:01,998
Oh, she's pretty. Yes, she is.

78
00:05:01,999 --> 00:05:05,998
And with her help, we're going
to get a much better look

79
00:05:05,999 --> 00:05:09,998
at these inadequate,
pitiful guys.

80
00:05:09,999 --> 00:05:11,998
Wait.

81
00:05:11,999 --> 00:05:13,998
You faked that? Uh-huh.

82
00:05:13,999 --> 00:05:16,999
This is going to be
our best blog post ever.

83
00:05:18,999 --> 00:05:21,998
All you care about
anymore is this blog.

84
00:05:21,999 --> 00:05:24,998
People love us. We are
getting so popular.

85
00:05:24,999 --> 00:05:27,998
Okay, we're not popular,
the blog is.

86
00:05:27,999 --> 00:05:29,998
No one even knows
we're behind it.

87
00:05:29,999 --> 00:05:31,998
Eventually they will,

88
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:34,998
if they want to make a TV
show or something about us.

89
00:05:34,999 --> 00:05:36,998
The odds of that happening--

90
00:05:36,999 --> 00:05:38,998
Stop being so negative, Avery.

91
00:05:38,999 --> 00:05:40,998
It's happened to
worse blogs than ours.

92
00:05:40,999 --> 00:05:43,998
Besides, it's fun.

93
00:05:43,999 --> 00:05:45,998
Right? Definitely.

94
00:05:45,999 --> 00:05:48,998
Okay, help me finish setting up
the rest of her profile.

95
00:05:48,999 --> 00:05:50,998
What is she looking for
in a mate?

96
00:05:50,999 --> 00:05:52,999
Someone with a sense of humor.

97
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,999
Yeah?

98
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,998
I'm here for Wanda.

99
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:41,998
I called earlier.

100
00:06:41,999 --> 00:06:43,998
I brought 300, like you said.

101
00:06:43,999 --> 00:06:45,998
For anything I want.
More, if it's kinky stuff.

102
00:06:45,999 --> 00:06:48,999
Wrong house.
It's across the street.

103
00:06:50,999 --> 00:06:52,998
Oh. Yeah.

104
00:06:52,999 --> 00:06:54,999
Sorry, man.

105
00:07:15,999 --> 00:07:18,998
Gifts for my two besties.

106
00:07:18,999 --> 00:07:20,998
Kaylie, what's this for?

107
00:07:20,999 --> 00:07:22,998
My mom and I found them
when we were shopping,

108
00:07:22,999 --> 00:07:25,998
and they reminded me of us.

109
00:07:25,999 --> 00:07:27,998
I love it, Kaylie. Thank you.

110
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:30,998
Me, too. I'm never
going to take it off.

111
00:07:30,999 --> 00:07:32,998
We match.

112
00:07:32,999 --> 00:07:34,998
This is our last year together

113
00:07:34,999 --> 00:07:37,998
before we all go off to college.

114
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,998
We've been friends
since the third grade,

115
00:07:39,999 --> 00:07:42,998
and I want us to stay
as close as we are now forever.

116
00:07:42,999 --> 00:07:44,998
I think that's the sweetest
thing you've ever said.

117
00:07:44,999 --> 00:07:47,998
Oh, my God, you guys.

118
00:07:47,999 --> 00:07:51,998
Someone responded to our
fake profile. What?

119
00:07:51,999 --> 00:07:53,998
What a total loser!

120
00:07:53,999 --> 00:07:57,998
He's a computer programmer.

121
00:07:57,999 --> 00:07:59,998
- What's his username?
- "BigJohnny."

122
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,999
Like, as in a big Johnson?

123
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,998
- Or a big nerd.
- Look how ugly he is.

124
00:08:05,999 --> 00:08:08,998
Wow, he's really... gross.

125
00:08:08,999 --> 00:08:10,998
"Hi, Diwata. My name's John.

126
00:08:10,999 --> 00:08:13,998
"I'm 32, and I live in Ralston.

127
00:08:13,999 --> 00:08:15,998
"I wanted to say hi

128
00:08:15,999 --> 00:08:17,998
"because I think
you're very beautiful,

129
00:08:17,999 --> 00:08:20,998
"and we think we both
seem to be looking

130
00:08:20,999 --> 00:08:23,999
for that special someone
to spend our lives with."

131
00:08:25,999 --> 00:08:28,998
"For me, I'm looking for the
right girl who will appreciate

132
00:08:28,999 --> 00:08:32,998
what I can offer and will let
me treat her like a princess."

133
00:08:32,999 --> 00:08:34,998
She'll have to
kiss the toad first.

134
00:08:34,999 --> 00:08:36,998
"My pictures are current.
Please read my profile,

135
00:08:36,999 --> 00:08:39,998
"and if you think you'd like
to get to know me better,

136
00:08:39,999 --> 00:08:41,999
e-mail me back. John."

137
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,998
This is priceless.
We have to respond.

138
00:08:45,999 --> 00:08:47,998
Can't we just finish the movie?

139
00:08:47,999 --> 00:08:50,998
We need content.
Content equals followers.

140
00:08:50,999 --> 00:08:52,998
And followers equals...

141
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:54,998
Everything.

142
00:08:54,999 --> 00:08:56,999
Let's respond. Okay.

143
00:09:43,999 --> 00:09:45,998
Hey, Diwata.

144
00:09:45,999 --> 00:09:47,999
Um, I've been working
on this for you.

145
00:10:00,999 --> 00:10:02,998
<i>Pleased to meet you.</i>

146
00:10:02,999 --> 00:10:06,999
<i>Now it's your turn.</i>

147
00:10:09,999 --> 00:10:12,999
<i>Fantastic.</i>

148
00:10:15,999 --> 00:10:17,998
Very good. Very good.

149
00:10:17,999 --> 00:10:20,999
Frederick Douglass,
<i>Narrative of a Slave.</i>

150
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,999
Who's read it?

151
00:10:33,999 --> 00:10:35,998
Okay. What was Douglass

152
00:10:35,999 --> 00:10:38,999
trying to tell us about slavery?

153
00:10:42,999 --> 00:10:46,999
Douglass explains how
slavery is humiliating.

154
00:10:53,999 --> 00:10:56,998
Kaylie, I'll take the phone.

155
00:10:56,999 --> 00:10:59,998
No, Mr. Brixton! I
promise to turn it off!

156
00:10:59,999 --> 00:11:02,998
You're my favorite teacher
in the whole world.

157
00:11:02,999 --> 00:11:04,999
Yeah, give me the phone.
You know the rules.

158
00:11:09,999 --> 00:11:12,998
Okay. What was Douglass

159
00:11:12,999 --> 00:11:14,998
trying to tell us about slavery?

160
00:11:14,999 --> 00:11:17,998
Honestly, I hate school.

161
00:11:17,999 --> 00:11:21,998
The idea of doing this
for four more years

162
00:11:21,999 --> 00:11:23,998
makes me want to slit my wrists.

163
00:11:23,999 --> 00:11:26,998
Yeah, but you can't just
not go go college.

164
00:11:26,999 --> 00:11:30,998
Yeah, I could,
if we sell the blog.

165
00:11:30,999 --> 00:11:33,998
Kaylie, I think you're taking
this thing way too seriously.

166
00:11:33,999 --> 00:11:35,998
I've done the research.

167
00:11:35,999 --> 00:11:37,998
It happens all the time.

168
00:11:37,999 --> 00:11:39,998
People start blogs
and YouTube channels,

169
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:43,998
and they get turned into books
and movies and TV shows.

170
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:46,998
The way ours is going,
it could happen.

171
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:48,999
And what if it doesn't?

172
00:11:50,999 --> 00:11:53,999
I just can't do
four more years of this.

173
00:11:55,999 --> 00:11:57,998
Here you go.

174
00:11:57,999 --> 00:11:59,998
Let me know if you guys
need anything else.

175
00:11:59,999 --> 00:12:02,998
I'm Wendy. Thank you, Wendy.

176
00:12:02,999 --> 00:12:04,998
Hoo-hoo!

177
00:12:04,999 --> 00:12:08,998
Damn! She got me
all hot and bothered.

178
00:12:08,999 --> 00:12:10,998
Can we go now?

179
00:12:10,999 --> 00:12:11,999
Not till we've hooked you up
with one of these stunners.

180
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,998
I have a girlfriend now.
Since when?

181
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,999
Here.

182
00:12:24,999 --> 00:12:27,998
She's from Manila. Hot!

183
00:12:27,999 --> 00:12:30,998
How did you meet her? Online.

184
00:12:30,999 --> 00:12:34,998
Super pretty, huh? Yeah-eah-eah.

185
00:12:34,999 --> 00:12:36,998
You should call her up
and tell her to come down.

186
00:12:36,999 --> 00:12:39,998
Oh, she's...

187
00:12:39,999 --> 00:12:43,998
she's super busy
taking classes and stuff.

188
00:12:43,999 --> 00:12:45,998
You should invite her
to the company party.

189
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:49,999
Yeah.

190
00:13:17,999 --> 00:13:19,998
Are you ever gonna
come get your box?

191
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,999
The delivery guy left it
with me over a week ago.

192
00:13:28,999 --> 00:13:30,998
Expensive software.

193
00:13:30,999 --> 00:13:33,998
Mm-hmm.

194
00:13:33,999 --> 00:13:36,998
I opened it on accident.

195
00:13:36,999 --> 00:13:40,998
I thought it was
something I ordered.

196
00:13:40,999 --> 00:13:43,000
You and me should
get together sometime.

197
00:13:44,999 --> 00:13:47,999
I'll give you a good price.

198
00:13:49,999 --> 00:13:50,998
I have a girlfriend.

199
00:13:50,999 --> 00:13:54,999
How come I've never
seen her, then?

200
00:13:56,999 --> 00:14:00,998
She... lives abroad. Well, then,

201
00:14:00,999 --> 00:14:04,000
you need someone nearby to keep those
pipes working while she's gone.

202
00:14:05,999 --> 00:14:08,998
Can't get any closer
than across the street.

203
00:14:08,999 --> 00:14:10,999
Right? I have to go.

204
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:28,998
Oh, my God. You aren't
gonna believe this.

205
00:14:28,999 --> 00:14:31,998
What? He just sent
a plane ticket.

206
00:14:31,999 --> 00:14:32,998
Who? Big John,

207
00:14:32,999 --> 00:14:35,998
so Diwata can come visit him.

208
00:14:35,999 --> 00:14:37,998
One-way ticket
from Manila to L.A.

209
00:14:37,999 --> 00:14:39,998
for some ridiculous
office party.

210
00:14:39,999 --> 00:14:43,998
Are you kidding? 830 bucks,

211
00:14:43,999 --> 00:14:47,998
plus a $600 agency fee
that I made up.

212
00:14:47,999 --> 00:14:50,998
Idiot. Seriously?

213
00:14:50,999 --> 00:14:52,999
Do you know what
this means for the blog?

214
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,998
The video we're gonna get when
he shows up at the airport,

215
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,998
and no one comes off the plane?

216
00:14:57,999 --> 00:15:00,998
That's, like, a lot of
money he can't get back.

217
00:15:00,999 --> 00:15:02,998
Who cares? This will make us

218
00:15:02,999 --> 00:15:05,998
the most popular prank
site in the country.

219
00:15:05,999 --> 00:15:08,998
I suppose.

220
00:15:08,999 --> 00:15:11,998
Come on. You're acting
all whiny like Avery.

221
00:15:11,999 --> 00:15:13,998
Have you told her
about the plane ticket yet?

222
00:15:13,999 --> 00:15:17,998
Not yet. Don't say anything.

223
00:15:17,999 --> 00:15:20,439
The way she's been acting lately,
I'm afraid she might blow it.

224
00:16:49,999 --> 00:16:51,998
Uh, Kaylie,

225
00:16:51,999 --> 00:16:53,998
this isn't how we
usually get to the mall.

226
00:16:53,999 --> 00:16:55,998
This is so messed up.
Just tell her.

227
00:16:55,999 --> 00:16:57,999
Wait. Tell me what?

228
00:16:59,999 --> 00:17:01,998
Fine.

229
00:17:01,999 --> 00:17:03,998
We're not going to the mall.

230
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:07,998
Okay, then where are we going?
Trust me.

231
00:17:07,999 --> 00:17:11,999
This is gonna be awesome.

232
00:17:40,999 --> 00:17:43,998
<i>Flight 477 from Lisbon
has now arrived.</i>

233
00:17:43,999 --> 00:17:47,999
<i>Flight 477 from Lisbon
has now arrived.</i>

234
00:17:58,999 --> 00:18:01,998
Please tell me
what we're doing here.

235
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:04,039
Just come with us. You're
going to ruin the surprise.

236
00:18:08,999 --> 00:18:12,998
Oh, my God. That's him!

237
00:18:12,999 --> 00:18:14,998
- I don't get it.
- Big Johnny thinks that.

238
00:18:14,999 --> 00:18:16,998
Diwata's arriving
from the Philippines.

239
00:18:16,999 --> 00:18:17,998
Are you kidding me?

240
00:18:17,999 --> 00:18:19,998
He even made a sign.

241
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:21,998
Mandy, go get a pic
with your phone.

242
00:18:21,999 --> 00:18:23,998
Maybe she's right.

243
00:18:23,999 --> 00:18:25,999
We shouldn't post this.

244
00:18:27,999 --> 00:18:29,998
Oh, my God.

245
00:18:29,999 --> 00:18:32,998
I have worked too hard
to let you guys ruin this.

246
00:18:32,999 --> 00:18:34,999
Seriously, Mandy,
go effing tape it!

247
00:18:50,999 --> 00:18:52,998
Kaylie, this is
just plain cruel.

248
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:55,998
Don't feel sorry
for his ugly ass.

249
00:18:55,999 --> 00:18:58,998
Why do you have to
make it worse for him?

250
00:18:58,999 --> 00:19:02,998
I am doing this on behalf of all
women on that mail-order site.

251
00:19:02,999 --> 00:19:04,998
He deserves some girl
that looks like a model?

252
00:19:04,999 --> 00:19:06,999
He doesn't.

253
00:19:08,999 --> 00:19:10,999
Would you even kiss that?
Hell, no.

254
00:19:18,999 --> 00:19:20,998
Look, I don't know why those
girls are on that site, okay?

255
00:19:20,999 --> 00:19:23,998
What I know is that you're
taking this way too far.

256
00:19:23,999 --> 00:19:25,998
It's not okay to just hurt
people so you can sell

257
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:28,998
your stupid blog and
avoid going to college.

258
00:19:28,999 --> 00:19:30,998
Well, guess what?

259
00:19:30,999 --> 00:19:34,999
3,238 followers
disagree with you.

260
00:19:40,999 --> 00:19:44,998
What happened to you? You
didn't use to be this way.

261
00:19:44,999 --> 00:19:47,998
What way? It's like you don't
care about people anymore.

262
00:19:47,999 --> 00:19:50,998
If they get hurt, so what?

263
00:19:50,999 --> 00:19:52,998
This guy would do
the same damn thing to you

264
00:19:52,999 --> 00:19:54,998
if he was clever enough
to think of it.

265
00:19:54,999 --> 00:19:56,998
Don't think he wouldn't.

266
00:19:56,999 --> 00:19:58,998
He's basically
trying to buy a wife.

267
00:19:58,999 --> 00:20:01,998
So, screw him.

268
00:20:01,999 --> 00:20:02,998
Where are you going?

269
00:20:02,999 --> 00:20:04,998
Home!

270
00:20:04,999 --> 00:20:07,999
It's an airport. I'm
sure I can find a cab.

271
00:20:17,999 --> 00:20:19,998
What's going on? She's
pissed off about the prank.

272
00:20:19,999 --> 00:20:21,999
Just let her go.

273
00:20:31,999 --> 00:20:33,999
This is perfect.

274
00:20:51,999 --> 00:20:54,998
Honey, what just happened? Why
did you just come home in a cab?

275
00:20:54,999 --> 00:20:56,998
I got in a fight with Kaylie
and decided to come home.

276
00:20:56,999 --> 00:20:58,998
From her house?

277
00:20:58,999 --> 00:21:00,998
No, from the airport.

278
00:21:00,999 --> 00:21:02,998
What?

279
00:21:02,999 --> 00:21:04,998
Yeah, uh,

280
00:21:04,999 --> 00:21:06,998
can we maybe talk
about it over dinner?

281
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:09,998
Yeah, yeah. Of course.

282
00:21:09,999 --> 00:21:10,999
Okay. Okay.

283
00:23:55,999 --> 00:23:57,999
♪♪

284
00:24:14,999 --> 00:24:16,998
Are you alone?

285
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:18,998
Oh, uh, yeah.

286
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:21,998
Where's the posse? Not sure.

287
00:24:21,999 --> 00:24:23,999
Avery.

288
00:24:24,999 --> 00:24:26,999
Can I please talk to you?

289
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:29,999
See you later.

290
00:24:31,999 --> 00:24:34,999
Uh, I have to get home. Please?

291
00:24:38,999 --> 00:24:40,998
I agree the joke was too much.

292
00:24:40,999 --> 00:24:43,998
I haven't even checked the
blog since she posted it.

293
00:24:43,999 --> 00:24:44,998
I feel so guilty.

294
00:24:44,999 --> 00:24:46,998
Does Kaylie feel bad?

295
00:24:46,999 --> 00:24:49,998
She's consumed with the blog.

296
00:24:49,999 --> 00:24:52,998
Look, it's not just that.
You guys had no right

297
00:24:52,999 --> 00:24:54,998
to trick me into
going to the airport.

298
00:24:54,999 --> 00:24:56,998
You're right. I'm sorry.

299
00:24:56,999 --> 00:24:58,998
Why do you go along with her?

300
00:24:58,999 --> 00:25:01,998
She's the reason we're popular.

301
00:25:01,999 --> 00:25:03,998
Who cares about that?

302
00:25:03,999 --> 00:25:06,998
You don't understand what
it's like on the other side.

303
00:25:06,999 --> 00:25:09,998
I do, and it sucks
being the fat kid

304
00:25:09,999 --> 00:25:12,998
who brings kimchi in her lunch
that everybody makes fun of.

305
00:25:12,999 --> 00:25:15,998
Then you of all people
should've known better.

306
00:25:15,999 --> 00:25:18,999
You're right.

307
00:25:34,999 --> 00:25:36,999
She's scared.

308
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,998
You and I are both
going off to college,

309
00:25:39,999 --> 00:25:41,998
and she knows she's
going to be left behind.

310
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:44,998
What do you think
these are all about?

311
00:25:44,999 --> 00:25:47,079
She can go to college, too.
She just doesn't want to.

312
00:25:53,999 --> 00:25:56,998
Who knows? Maybe
she really can sell it,

313
00:25:56,999 --> 00:25:58,998
and we get famous
and make lots of money.

314
00:25:58,999 --> 00:26:00,998
Stranger things have happened.

315
00:26:00,999 --> 00:26:02,999
You're kidding yourself.

316
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:10,999
We've all been friends
too long to just end it.

317
00:26:12,999 --> 00:26:14,998
Talk to her.

318
00:26:14,999 --> 00:26:16,998
She cares a lot about you,

319
00:26:16,999 --> 00:26:18,999
and I know you care
about her, too.

320
00:26:42,999 --> 00:26:44,998
Hi, I'm Nick.

321
00:26:44,999 --> 00:26:48,999
Hey, um, oh, come on in.

322
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,999
Nice place.

323
00:27:00,999 --> 00:27:02,998
Can I, uh, sit down?

324
00:27:02,999 --> 00:27:04,999
Oh, sure, yeah.

325
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:16,998
So, uh, I like to get business
out of the way first.

326
00:27:16,999 --> 00:27:18,998
It's 200.

327
00:27:18,999 --> 00:27:21,999
Yeah. Yeah, uh...

328
00:27:29,999 --> 00:27:31,998
So what did you have in mind?

329
00:27:31,999 --> 00:27:32,999
Uh, I-I'm not gay.

330
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,998
That's fine.

331
00:27:34,999 --> 00:27:36,998
Gay, straight--
Doesn't matter to me.

332
00:27:36,999 --> 00:27:39,998
No, I-I mean I don't want

333
00:27:39,999 --> 00:27:41,998
any sort of sex from you.

334
00:27:41,999 --> 00:27:44,998
I wanted to hire you
for something else.

335
00:27:44,999 --> 00:27:47,998
I'm just trying to
play a little joke

336
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,999
on, on my niece.

337
00:28:07,999 --> 00:28:10,999
I see Trevor accepted
your friend request.

338
00:28:13,999 --> 00:28:17,999
Look, sorry about
the whole airport thing.

339
00:28:18,999 --> 00:28:22,998
It was totally wrong
to trick you into going.

340
00:28:22,999 --> 00:28:25,998
Let's just put it
behind us, okay?

341
00:28:25,999 --> 00:28:27,998
No, I don't want any part of it.

342
00:28:27,999 --> 00:28:29,999
Fine.

343
00:28:30,999 --> 00:28:32,998
Your friendship is
more important to me

344
00:28:32,999 --> 00:28:35,998
than this stupid blog.
I just want the three of us

345
00:28:35,999 --> 00:28:37,998
to go back to the way
we used to be.

346
00:28:37,999 --> 00:28:39,998
Really?

347
00:28:39,999 --> 00:28:41,999
I miss you.

348
00:28:43,999 --> 00:28:45,998
All right.

349
00:28:45,999 --> 00:28:47,999
You have to go to that party
while your mom's in Phoenix.

350
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,998
I haven't been to
a party in forever.

351
00:28:49,999 --> 00:28:51,998
We just went to Justin's party
less than two months ago.

352
00:28:51,999 --> 00:28:54,998
Yeah. Excuse me.

353
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:57,119
Do any of you have a tissue
in your purse or something?

354
00:28:58,999 --> 00:29:01,998
I got this grease
all over my hands.

355
00:29:01,999 --> 00:29:02,998
I do.

356
00:29:02,999 --> 00:29:04,998
Thanks.

357
00:29:04,999 --> 00:29:07,998
I'm Nick, by the way. Kaylie.

358
00:29:07,999 --> 00:29:10,998
I'm Mandy. Avery.

359
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,998
Hi. So...

360
00:29:12,999 --> 00:29:14,998
why haven't I seen you
around here before?

361
00:29:14,999 --> 00:29:16,998
I just moved here
from Pittsburgh.

362
00:29:16,999 --> 00:29:18,998
That's cool.

363
00:29:18,999 --> 00:29:21,999
Well, so what do you guys
do for fun around here?

364
00:29:24,999 --> 00:29:25,999
You got it?

365
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,998
Yeah. Kaylie Mack.

366
00:29:28,999 --> 00:29:30,999
I'll give you my number, too.

367
00:29:33,999 --> 00:29:36,999
Cool, cool. Well,
catch you guys later.

368
00:29:38,999 --> 00:29:40,998
Nick...

369
00:29:40,999 --> 00:29:43,998
Avery's having a party
at her house this weekend,

370
00:29:43,999 --> 00:29:45,998
if you want to come.

371
00:29:45,999 --> 00:29:49,999
Maybe. Text me the details.

372
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:54,998
Kaylie, what are you doing?
I'm not having a party.

373
00:29:54,999 --> 00:29:56,998
You have to.

374
00:29:56,999 --> 00:29:58,998
First of all, Mandy,
I saw him first.

375
00:29:58,999 --> 00:30:01,998
No, you didn't. he talked to all
three of us at the same time.

376
00:30:01,999 --> 00:30:04,998
I gave him the tissues,
so I get first dibs.

377
00:30:04,999 --> 00:30:06,999
Guys, it doesn't matter anyway.

378
00:30:15,999 --> 00:30:17,998
Got it.

379
00:30:17,999 --> 00:30:19,998
And...

380
00:30:19,999 --> 00:30:21,998
they invited me to
a party this weekend.

381
00:30:21,999 --> 00:30:23,998
Wow.

382
00:30:23,999 --> 00:30:27,998
What about Trevor? It's the perfect
chance to be alone with him.

383
00:30:27,999 --> 00:30:28,998
It won't be a rager.

384
00:30:28,999 --> 00:30:31,998
Just a few intimate friends.

385
00:30:31,999 --> 00:30:33,998
Please?

386
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:35,999
That guy is gorgeous!

387
00:30:37,999 --> 00:30:40,998
Okay, fine.
But just a few friends,

388
00:30:40,999 --> 00:30:42,999
and we're not
calling it a party.

389
00:30:44,999 --> 00:30:47,998
All right. Take it easy.

390
00:30:47,999 --> 00:30:50,999
Yeah.

391
00:30:58,999 --> 00:31:00,998
Bye, Mom. Have a safe trip.
Okay.

392
00:31:00,999 --> 00:31:03,998
I will text you as soon as
I get to the hotel in Phoenix.

393
00:31:03,999 --> 00:31:04,998
Okay. Love you. Love you, too.

394
00:31:04,999 --> 00:31:06,999
Bye.

395
00:32:27,999 --> 00:32:30,998
Party of the year.

396
00:32:30,999 --> 00:32:34,998
Stop using the "P" word.

397
00:32:34,999 --> 00:32:37,998
We should do something
for the blog tonight.

398
00:32:37,999 --> 00:32:39,998
Play a joke.

399
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:42,998
Nothing mean. Right, Avery?

400
00:32:42,999 --> 00:32:43,998
How about we put water
in the vodka bottles

401
00:32:43,999 --> 00:32:45,999
and see who acts drunk
when they're not?

402
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:49,998
Okay, just no tricks
on Trevor, okay?

403
00:32:49,999 --> 00:32:51,999
Fine. Kaylie?

404
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,999
Okay.

405
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:25,998
Avery, he didn't show.

406
00:33:25,999 --> 00:33:28,998
Who, Nick? Of course I mean Nick.
He said he was gonna come.

407
00:33:28,999 --> 00:33:31,998
Okay, just text him.

408
00:33:31,999 --> 00:33:33,998
That'll make me look desperate.

409
00:33:33,999 --> 00:33:35,998
So just wait a little longer.

410
00:33:35,999 --> 00:33:37,999
I don't know,
maybe he's running late.

411
00:33:39,999 --> 00:33:43,998
Sorry. Yeah, I just
can't stand her.

412
00:33:43,999 --> 00:33:45,998
Yeah, I know.
Just give her a chance.

413
00:33:45,999 --> 00:33:47,999
She's trying.

414
00:34:09,999 --> 00:34:11,998
You're gonna go
meet him by yourself?

415
00:34:11,999 --> 00:34:14,998
You don't even know this guy.
I know he's hot.

416
00:34:14,999 --> 00:34:16,998
What if he's
a rapist or something?

417
00:34:16,999 --> 00:34:19,998
You can't rape the willing.

418
00:34:19,999 --> 00:34:22,998
I'm just kidding. That's why
I want you to go with me.

419
00:34:22,999 --> 00:34:26,998
And leave the party? No way. Tell
him to get his ass over here.

420
00:34:26,999 --> 00:34:30,998
We can convince him in person
and then come back.

421
00:34:30,999 --> 00:34:33,998
Okay, fine.
Only because I don't want you

422
00:34:33,999 --> 00:34:35,998
to end up dead in a ditch
or something.

423
00:34:35,999 --> 00:34:38,999
Aw, such a good friend.
Let's go.

424
00:34:56,999 --> 00:34:58,999
I guess Avery and Trevor
are together now.

425
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,998
Guess so.

426
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:03,999
She could do so much better.

427
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:36,998
You know, you, uh, haven't
shown me your room yet.

428
00:35:36,999 --> 00:35:40,998
I don't think I could just
leave everybody alone.

429
00:35:40,999 --> 00:35:42,999
Oh, come on. They'll be fine.

430
00:35:44,999 --> 00:35:48,998
Okay. Um, I just need to
tell Mandy she's in charge.

431
00:35:48,999 --> 00:35:50,998
Go down the hall, and it's
the last door on your left.

432
00:35:50,999 --> 00:35:52,998
Okay.

433
00:35:52,999 --> 00:35:54,999
Well, then, I'll see you there.

434
00:36:11,999 --> 00:36:13,998
Where is he?

435
00:36:13,999 --> 00:36:16,999
He's in there. Let's go.

436
00:36:18,999 --> 00:36:21,998
<i>Attention, skateboarders
and visitors,</i>

437
00:36:21,999 --> 00:36:23,998
<i>we'll be closing
in about 10 minutes,</i>

438
00:36:23,999 --> 00:36:26,998
<i>so please gather your
equipment and belongings</i>

439
00:36:26,999 --> 00:36:29,998
<i>and make your way
to the front door exit.</i>

440
00:36:29,999 --> 00:36:31,999
<i>Thank you.</i>

441
00:36:38,999 --> 00:36:40,999
Nick!

442
00:36:44,999 --> 00:36:46,000
This is creepy.

443
00:36:53,999 --> 00:36:55,999
Nick!

444
00:36:58,999 --> 00:37:00,998
Nick!

445
00:37:00,999 --> 00:37:02,998
I think we should
go back to the party.

446
00:37:02,999 --> 00:37:05,998
I'm getting a really weird vibe.

447
00:37:05,999 --> 00:37:08,999
Let's just check downstairs.
Come on.

448
00:37:25,999 --> 00:37:27,998
No one's here.

449
00:37:27,999 --> 00:37:29,999
Maybe he's playing a joke
on you or something.

450
00:37:32,999 --> 00:37:34,999
This isn't funny, Nick.

451
00:37:36,999 --> 00:37:38,998
Get your ass out here!
We're leaving!

452
00:37:38,999 --> 00:37:41,998
I'm leaving now.
This is effed up.

453
00:37:41,999 --> 00:37:43,999
Mandy! I'll be in the car.

454
00:38:05,999 --> 00:38:07,999
You know what?

455
00:38:08,999 --> 00:38:10,998
You're an a-hole.

456
00:38:10,999 --> 00:38:13,999
Perfect.

457
00:38:46,999 --> 00:38:48,999
Mandy...

458
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:56,999
Where the hell is she?

459
00:39:10,999 --> 00:39:12,998
The skate park is closing.

460
00:39:12,999 --> 00:39:14,998
What are you doing out here?

461
00:39:14,999 --> 00:39:17,998
I was just texting my friend.

462
00:39:17,999 --> 00:39:19,998
Have you seen her? She was
here a few minutes ago.

463
00:39:19,999 --> 00:39:23,998
Nope. Like I said,
the park is closing.

464
00:39:23,999 --> 00:39:26,998
Let's move it along.

465
00:39:26,999 --> 00:39:28,998
"Went home"?

466
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:31,998
How?

467
00:39:31,999 --> 00:39:33,999
Move it along.

468
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:37,998
I'm leaving.

469
00:39:37,999 --> 00:39:40,999
You can go take
your doughnut break now.

470
00:39:47,999 --> 00:39:49,999
♪♪

471
00:39:54,999 --> 00:39:56,999
Three missed calls?

472
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,999
Damn it.

473
00:40:00,999 --> 00:40:03,998
<i>I hate to do it,
but I will call the police</i>

474
00:40:03,999 --> 00:40:06,239
<i>if you don't turn it down and
move the cars...</i> Fantastic.

475
00:40:09,999 --> 00:40:12,998
Hey, uh, sorry, guys.
Party's over.

476
00:40:12,999 --> 00:40:14,998
I don't know
if the cops were called,

477
00:40:14,999 --> 00:40:17,998
so if you're sober, you
should probably leave now,

478
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:20,998
and if you're not,
then, I don't know,

479
00:40:20,999 --> 00:40:22,998
I'll try and find
you guys a ride home.

480
00:40:22,999 --> 00:40:24,998
So...

481
00:40:24,999 --> 00:40:26,998
out.

482
00:40:26,999 --> 00:40:28,999
Thank you.

483
00:40:53,999 --> 00:40:55,998
What's going on?

484
00:40:55,999 --> 00:40:57,998
What do you think?
Neighbors complained.

485
00:40:57,999 --> 00:40:59,998
Did Mandy come back?

486
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:01,999
No, I haven't seen her.
Where were you, anyway?

487
00:41:03,999 --> 00:41:05,998
It has to be her playing a joke.

488
00:41:05,999 --> 00:41:07,999
That little bitch!

489
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,998
What are you talking about?
That jerk-off Nick

490
00:41:10,999 --> 00:41:13,998
texted me and told me to go all the
way out to the skate park to meet him

491
00:41:13,999 --> 00:41:15,998
and then didn't show.

492
00:41:15,999 --> 00:41:17,998
Mandy goes with me,
then disappears.

493
00:41:17,999 --> 00:41:20,998
Texts me a few minutes later
and says she went home.

494
00:41:20,999 --> 00:41:23,998
Does that mean she walked?

495
00:41:23,999 --> 00:41:25,998
From the skate park,
that's, like, five miles.

496
00:41:25,999 --> 00:41:28,998
Or maybe Nick drove her home.

497
00:41:28,999 --> 00:41:29,998
Screw her! It's
probably for the blog.

498
00:41:29,999 --> 00:41:31,998
Mandy wouldn't do that.

499
00:41:31,999 --> 00:41:33,998
Nick is probably just an ass.

500
00:41:33,999 --> 00:41:35,998
She wanted him from the start.

501
00:41:35,999 --> 00:41:37,998
I think you should just
go look for her, okay?

502
00:41:37,999 --> 00:41:40,998
I got to get this place cleaned
up and Trevor out of here.

503
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:41,998
Where's Trevor?

504
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,999
Passed out in my mom's bed.

505
00:41:45,999 --> 00:41:46,999
I'll go kick him out.

506
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:41,999
Oh, my God!

507
00:42:43,999 --> 00:42:45,998
Look! You pissed yourself!

508
00:42:45,999 --> 00:42:47,999
Go to hell, Kaylie.

509
00:42:49,999 --> 00:42:51,999
What happened? Ask your friend.

510
00:42:53,999 --> 00:42:56,998
Kaylie, you promised
not to play a trick on him.

511
00:42:56,999 --> 00:42:59,998
It's water. He's fine.

512
00:42:59,999 --> 00:43:01,998
I can't believe
I gave you another chance.

513
00:43:01,999 --> 00:43:03,998
You don't even realize
what you did wrong.

514
00:43:03,999 --> 00:43:06,998
Seriously, I'm done.

515
00:43:06,999 --> 00:43:08,998
Just get the hell
out of my house.

516
00:43:08,999 --> 00:43:11,998
You know what?
That's fine with me.

517
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:13,998
I don't want to be
friends with you either.

518
00:43:13,999 --> 00:43:16,998
You're not even fun
to be around.

519
00:43:16,999 --> 00:43:18,998
All you do is bitch and whine.

520
00:43:18,999 --> 00:43:20,999
It's getting really old.

521
00:43:28,999 --> 00:43:30,999
Do you remember me?

522
00:43:35,999 --> 00:43:37,999
I remember you, too.

523
00:43:48,999 --> 00:43:51,998
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

524
00:43:51,999 --> 00:43:55,999
Be... quiet!

525
00:44:02,999 --> 00:44:04,999
I just have one question.

526
00:44:06,999 --> 00:44:09,998
Why did you do that to me?

527
00:44:09,999 --> 00:44:14,000
I don't know. It was so stupid.

528
00:44:16,999 --> 00:44:18,998
Kaylie came up with the idea,

529
00:44:18,999 --> 00:44:20,999
and we thought it would
be funny, I guess.

530
00:44:22,999 --> 00:44:25,998
It was mean. We
shouldn't have done it.

531
00:44:25,999 --> 00:44:29,998
It was Kaylie's idea. I see.

532
00:44:29,999 --> 00:44:32,998
So...

533
00:44:32,999 --> 00:44:34,998
if I had to pick
one person to blame,

534
00:44:34,999 --> 00:44:36,999
that person would be Kaylie?

535
00:44:45,999 --> 00:44:47,999
What are you gonna do to me?

536
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,998
If you let me go, I swear I
won't say anything to anyone.

537
00:44:51,999 --> 00:44:53,998
We'll call it even.

538
00:44:53,999 --> 00:44:55,999
We played a joke,
you played one.

539
00:44:58,999 --> 00:45:00,999
Except this isn't a joke.

540
00:45:03,999 --> 00:45:05,999
This is very real.

541
00:45:08,999 --> 00:45:10,998
The pain I felt at the airport

542
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:13,998
was real.

543
00:45:13,999 --> 00:45:16,998
And you're soon
gonna understand pain.

544
00:45:16,999 --> 00:45:19,998
I'm so sorry.

545
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:22,999
We never wanted to hurt you.

546
00:45:29,999 --> 00:45:31,998
I think you did.

547
00:45:31,999 --> 00:45:33,998
I'm pretty sure
it's why you did it.

548
00:45:33,999 --> 00:45:37,998
I swear to God.

549
00:45:37,999 --> 00:45:39,999
We never even considered it.

550
00:45:40,999 --> 00:45:44,999
It was just a stupid thing
for this stupid blog.

551
00:45:48,999 --> 00:45:51,998
It's my turn now...

552
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,999
to be mean.

553
00:46:01,999 --> 00:46:04,998
<i>Oh, that's great, Bunny.</i>

554
00:46:04,999 --> 00:46:08,999
<i>As you know, Bunny
has won $17,380!</i>

555
00:46:26,999 --> 00:46:28,000
What the...

556
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:02,998
Don't move...

557
00:48:02,999 --> 00:48:04,999
Kaylie.

558
00:48:06,999 --> 00:48:08,998
The problem with
these smart systems

559
00:48:08,999 --> 00:48:10,998
is they aren't that smart.

560
00:48:10,999 --> 00:48:13,998
Sounds convenient, doesn't it,

561
00:48:13,999 --> 00:48:15,998
to control everything
with one device?

562
00:48:15,999 --> 00:48:18,998
Now I control everything.

563
00:48:18,999 --> 00:48:20,998
Please don't hurt me!

564
00:48:20,999 --> 00:48:22,998
We'll give you your money back

565
00:48:22,999 --> 00:48:24,998
or anything else you want!

566
00:48:24,999 --> 00:48:26,999
Hurt you?

567
00:48:27,999 --> 00:48:30,999
All you care about is yourself.

568
00:48:32,999 --> 00:48:35,999
No more pranks, Kaylie.

569
00:48:37,999 --> 00:48:40,999
Your moment of truth is here.

570
00:49:17,999 --> 00:49:19,999
Mandy!

571
00:49:25,999 --> 00:49:27,998
Help!

572
00:49:27,999 --> 00:49:29,999
Someone, help!

573
00:49:31,999 --> 00:49:33,999
Someone!

574
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:37,999
Help!

575
00:49:39,999 --> 00:49:41,998
This is your fault.

576
00:49:41,999 --> 00:49:44,998
He's gonna kill us,
and it's your fault

577
00:49:44,999 --> 00:49:46,998
because of that stupid blog!

578
00:49:46,999 --> 00:49:49,999
Mandy...

579
00:49:51,999 --> 00:49:52,999
where are we?

580
00:49:55,999 --> 00:49:57,999
I don't know where we are.

581
00:50:14,999 --> 00:50:15,998
Hello?

582
00:50:15,999 --> 00:50:18,998
Avery, this is Brandi Kim.
Is Mandy with you?

583
00:50:18,999 --> 00:50:21,998
No. She was here
for a while last night,

584
00:50:21,999 --> 00:50:23,998
and then she left with
Kaylie and didn't come back.

585
00:50:23,999 --> 00:50:26,998
<i>Well, Mandy didn't
come home last night.</i>

586
00:50:26,999 --> 00:50:29,998
<i>I just tried Kaylie, and she's
not answering her cell phone.</i>

587
00:50:29,999 --> 00:50:32,998
<i>So, they went out to
meet this guy, Nick,</i>

588
00:50:32,999 --> 00:50:34,998
and Kaylie said that
Mandy texted

589
00:50:34,999 --> 00:50:37,998
saying that she was
going home by herself?

590
00:50:37,999 --> 00:50:38,998
Yeah, something like that.

591
00:50:38,999 --> 00:50:40,998
Okay, do you have
any texts from this Nick?

592
00:50:40,999 --> 00:50:42,999
No. Mandy and Kaylie

593
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,998
were the only ones
to get his number.

594
00:50:45,999 --> 00:50:48,998
I think they'd been
communicating over Snapchat.

595
00:50:48,999 --> 00:50:51,998
So, the messages are
probably gone anyway.

596
00:50:51,999 --> 00:50:54,998
Yeah. How did you meet this guy?

597
00:50:54,999 --> 00:50:58,998
He came up to us last week
at the skate park,

598
00:50:58,999 --> 00:51:02,998
and he told us that he was from
Pittsburgh and didn't know anybody.

599
00:51:02,999 --> 00:51:05,998
What day was this? Tuesday.

600
00:51:05,999 --> 00:51:07,998
Oh, I think he actually
might be in a picture

601
00:51:07,999 --> 00:51:09,998
that I took of Trevor--
Hold on.

602
00:51:09,999 --> 00:51:11,998
Yeah, look, this is all I have.

603
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:13,999
It's not very good, but...

604
00:51:15,999 --> 00:51:17,998
Okay.

605
00:51:17,999 --> 00:51:20,999
Thank you. This'll help.

606
00:51:28,999 --> 00:51:31,998
It's no use.
They won't come off.

607
00:51:31,999 --> 00:51:32,999
Shut up!

608
00:51:52,999 --> 00:51:54,999
Oh! Where are they?

609
00:52:59,999 --> 00:53:02,998
I want to know

610
00:53:02,999 --> 00:53:05,998
why you think it's funny

611
00:53:05,999 --> 00:53:08,998
to hurt someone.

612
00:53:08,999 --> 00:53:10,998
Maybe we should let
Kaylie answer,

613
00:53:10,999 --> 00:53:12,999
since this was all her idea.

614
00:53:16,999 --> 00:53:18,998
My idea? Yeah.

615
00:53:18,999 --> 00:53:21,998
That's what Mandy said.

616
00:53:21,999 --> 00:53:23,998
It<i> was</i> your idea!

617
00:53:23,999 --> 00:53:26,998
We didn't even know you bought the
plane ticket until after she told us.

618
00:53:26,999 --> 00:53:29,998
- Shut up, Mandy!
- Answer me--

619
00:53:29,999 --> 00:53:31,999
Why is it funny

620
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,998
to hurt someone?

621
00:53:34,999 --> 00:53:37,319
We didn't think it was going to
hurt anyone when we started.

622
00:53:39,999 --> 00:53:41,998
It was just fun pretending to be

623
00:53:41,999 --> 00:53:43,999
a fake girl online
and seeing what guys say.

624
00:53:54,999 --> 00:53:57,000
Has anybody ever hurt you?

625
00:54:00,999 --> 00:54:03,999
You've never been hurt.

626
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:16,998
Do you know what
the word "pariah" means,

627
00:54:16,999 --> 00:54:17,999
Kaylie?

628
00:54:19,999 --> 00:54:21,999
Pariah?

629
00:54:25,999 --> 00:54:27,998
Avery?

630
00:54:27,999 --> 00:54:30,999
It means someone
who's an outcast.

631
00:54:37,999 --> 00:54:39,999
Yeah.

632
00:54:45,999 --> 00:54:48,999
It's someone that...

633
00:54:50,999 --> 00:54:52,998
the beautiful people

634
00:54:52,999 --> 00:54:55,000
treat badly because
they aren't beautiful.

635
00:54:57,999 --> 00:55:01,999
Beautiful like you.

636
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,999
Avery?

637
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:29,998
Hello?

638
00:55:29,999 --> 00:55:31,998
Rihanne, it's Jenny Mack.
Are the girls with you?

639
00:55:31,999 --> 00:55:34,998
Well, I just walked in,
but I'm sure Avery's here.

640
00:55:34,999 --> 00:55:36,998
Avery?

641
00:55:36,999 --> 00:55:39,998
<i>The police are here. I came
home this morning to find</i>

642
00:55:39,999 --> 00:55:41,999
our security system down,
all the power was out,

643
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,998
and Kaylie's gone, but her car,

644
00:55:44,999 --> 00:55:46,998
<i>her purse, her cell phone
are still here.</i>

645
00:55:46,999 --> 00:55:49,998
And there were messages
from Brandi Kim.

646
00:55:49,999 --> 00:55:52,998
<i>She left them on her cell.</i>

647
00:55:52,999 --> 00:55:54,999
They think that Mandy
was abducted last night.

648
00:55:56,999 --> 00:56:00,998
Avery? She's not here either.

649
00:56:00,999 --> 00:56:03,999
This can't be happening.

650
00:56:55,999 --> 00:56:57,999
I kept thinking...

651
00:57:00,999 --> 00:57:03,999
what would it take to teach
these girls a lesson,

652
00:57:06,999 --> 00:57:09,998
to show them the harm

653
00:57:09,999 --> 00:57:12,999
that their jokes can cause?

654
00:57:33,999 --> 00:57:37,999
Get away from me,
you disgusting creep!

655
00:57:41,999 --> 00:57:43,998
And then I remembered something

656
00:57:43,999 --> 00:57:47,998
my father used to say.

657
00:57:47,999 --> 00:57:50,998
He'd say, "You couldn't
know a person's life

658
00:57:50,999 --> 00:57:53,998
until you've walked
in their shoes."

659
00:57:53,999 --> 00:57:55,998
And when I was little,

660
00:57:55,999 --> 00:57:57,998
I thought that meant

661
00:57:57,999 --> 00:58:00,998
you had to put their shoes on.

662
00:58:00,999 --> 00:58:02,998
And now I realize

663
00:58:02,999 --> 00:58:05,999
that he meant it
in a figurative way.

664
00:58:09,999 --> 00:58:12,998
You are as stupid

665
00:58:12,999 --> 00:58:14,998
as you are ugly.

666
00:58:14,999 --> 00:58:16,999
Kaylie, stop it.

667
00:58:19,999 --> 00:58:21,999
You really are so pretty.

668
00:58:23,999 --> 00:58:26,998
You must be used to getting

669
00:58:26,999 --> 00:58:29,999
everything that you want.
John...

670
00:58:30,999 --> 00:58:32,999
when we played that stupid joke,

671
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,998
you were just some guy online. We
didn't know anything about you.

672
00:58:35,999 --> 00:58:38,998
So that makes it okay?

673
00:58:38,999 --> 00:58:40,998
No. When we saw you
at the airport,

674
00:58:40,999 --> 00:58:42,999
we felt really bad
about what we did.

675
00:58:46,999 --> 00:58:49,998
So bad, you put the video online

676
00:58:49,999 --> 00:58:52,998
for the whole world to see it.

677
00:58:52,999 --> 00:58:54,999
So why'd you bring us here?

678
00:58:56,999 --> 00:58:59,999
So you can sleep with us?

679
00:59:00,999 --> 00:59:03,998
So you can finally experience

680
00:59:03,999 --> 00:59:05,998
having sex with something

681
00:59:05,999 --> 00:59:08,998
other than your hand?

682
00:59:08,999 --> 00:59:10,998
Kaylie...
Stop saying that stuff!

683
00:59:10,999 --> 00:59:13,998
Even though you don't have
control, you think you do.

684
00:59:13,999 --> 00:59:18,998
I'm pretty sure that'll
change soon enough.

685
00:59:18,999 --> 00:59:22,998
John, whatever you have planned,

686
00:59:22,999 --> 00:59:26,999
it's not worth
going to jail for.

687
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:48,998
The women here,

688
00:59:48,999 --> 00:59:51,999
they think they're
better than men.

689
00:59:55,999 --> 00:59:58,998
All women want

690
00:59:58,999 --> 01:00:01,998
is trips

691
01:00:01,999 --> 01:00:03,998
and jewelry

692
01:00:03,999 --> 01:00:05,998
and nice dinners,

693
01:00:05,999 --> 01:00:07,998
and then they want you
to sleep on the couch

694
01:00:07,999 --> 01:00:09,999
while they sleep in your bed.

695
01:00:12,999 --> 01:00:15,000
How is that fair?

696
01:00:16,999 --> 01:00:19,998
It only happens here.

697
01:00:19,999 --> 01:00:22,998
In other parts of the world,

698
01:00:22,999 --> 01:00:25,998
women are grateful for
everything that you give them,

699
01:00:25,999 --> 01:00:28,998
and they love you
for your personality,

700
01:00:28,999 --> 01:00:30,999
not for your looks.

701
01:00:39,999 --> 01:00:43,998
I told you he just wanted
a female slave.

702
01:00:43,999 --> 01:00:45,999
I did not!

703
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:49,998
I would've treated
her like a queen!

704
01:00:49,999 --> 01:00:54,998
And I would've taken her dancing

705
01:00:54,999 --> 01:00:56,998
and bought her flowers

706
01:00:56,999 --> 01:00:59,999
and made her breakfast in bed.

707
01:01:02,999 --> 01:01:04,998
I think you would make
a great husband.

708
01:01:04,999 --> 01:01:07,998
But...

709
01:01:07,999 --> 01:01:09,998
you'll never get the chance
if you kill us.

710
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:11,999
Is that what you want?

711
01:01:13,999 --> 01:01:15,999
A great husband?

712
01:01:17,999 --> 01:01:18,999
Someday.

713
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,998
I'm not gonna kill you.

714
01:01:23,999 --> 01:01:25,998
Then what are you
gonna do, John?

715
01:01:25,999 --> 01:01:28,999
Please let us go.

716
01:01:34,999 --> 01:01:36,999
You'll see.

717
01:01:39,999 --> 01:01:41,998
<i>Did your daughter
mention anything to you</i>

718
01:01:41,999 --> 01:01:44,999
about this guy they met
at the skate park, uh, Nick?

719
01:01:45,999 --> 01:01:48,998
No. No, never.

720
01:01:48,999 --> 01:01:51,998
Well, do you know anyone who might
want to harm Avery or her friends?

721
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:52,998
No. For any reason?

722
01:01:52,999 --> 01:01:54,998
No.

723
01:01:54,999 --> 01:01:57,998
I mean, Avery's been upset
with Kaylie lately.

724
01:01:57,999 --> 01:01:59,998
They've sort of
been on the outs.

725
01:01:59,999 --> 01:02:02,998
Why is that? Something about

726
01:02:02,999 --> 01:02:06,999
a prank that Kaylie was playing,
some sort of secret blog.

727
01:02:08,999 --> 01:02:10,998
A blog?

728
01:02:10,999 --> 01:02:12,998
Yeah. Yeah, no, yeah, yeah,

729
01:02:12,999 --> 01:02:14,998
I can bring all three--
All three tonight.

730
01:02:14,999 --> 01:02:17,999
Just tell me when and where.

731
01:02:20,999 --> 01:02:21,999
Yeah.

732
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:25,998
Okay.

733
01:02:25,999 --> 01:02:26,998
He...

734
01:02:26,999 --> 01:02:28,999
Freakin' God.

735
01:02:33,999 --> 01:02:35,998
Mandy,

736
01:02:35,999 --> 01:02:38,998
shut the hell up.

737
01:02:38,999 --> 01:02:41,999
I hate you so much right now.

738
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,998
He's gonna kill us.

739
01:02:45,999 --> 01:02:48,998
I just know it.

740
01:02:48,999 --> 01:02:50,999
I'm not going down
without a fight.

741
01:02:52,999 --> 01:02:55,999
I'll rip his throat out
if I get the chance.

742
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,998
We just need to wait
for the right moment.

743
01:03:00,999 --> 01:03:02,998
It's been taken down.

744
01:03:02,999 --> 01:03:05,999
Well, maybe tech can
roll back the site.

745
01:03:31,999 --> 01:03:34,999
It's time to go.

746
01:03:37,999 --> 01:03:40,998
Wait, where are you taking us?

747
01:03:40,999 --> 01:03:42,998
You'll see.

748
01:03:42,999 --> 01:03:44,998
Please don't kill us.

749
01:03:44,999 --> 01:03:46,998
Please? You're gonna live.

750
01:03:46,999 --> 01:03:51,998
Just a very different life
than the one you planned.

751
01:03:51,999 --> 01:03:53,999
One where girls like you
aren't the one in control.

752
01:04:27,999 --> 01:04:30,999
All right, let's see 'em.

753
01:04:48,999 --> 01:04:51,998
No!

754
01:04:51,999 --> 01:04:54,998
No! Don't touch me!

755
01:04:54,999 --> 01:04:55,999
Stop!

756
01:04:58,999 --> 01:04:59,999
Truck.

757
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:05,999
Good. The other two?

758
01:05:07,999 --> 01:05:10,999
Where-Where's the money?

759
01:05:12,999 --> 01:05:15,998
We get the girls, and then you get paid.
That's the deal.

760
01:05:15,999 --> 01:05:17,998
No, no, that isn't the deal.

761
01:05:17,999 --> 01:05:20,998
I want it now, and then you
can get the other two.

762
01:05:20,999 --> 01:05:23,998
Unlock the car.

763
01:05:23,999 --> 01:05:26,999
I'm taking the girls.
Be happy you get to live.

764
01:05:31,999 --> 01:05:34,999
Let's go. We got one.

765
01:05:43,999 --> 01:05:46,998
We can't leave Kaylie!

766
01:05:46,999 --> 01:05:49,999
We have to go back!

767
01:05:53,999 --> 01:05:56,998
Two counts of prostitution,
a few minor drug charges.

768
01:05:56,999 --> 01:05:58,998
Petty hustler.

769
01:05:58,999 --> 01:06:01,998
And there are no videos
of him on the girls' blog?

770
01:06:01,999 --> 01:06:03,998
None that I saw.

771
01:06:03,999 --> 01:06:05,998
Do we know where
this guy hangs out?

772
01:06:05,999 --> 01:06:07,998
We're working on it now.

773
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:09,999
Thanks, Ray. You got it.

774
01:06:20,999 --> 01:06:23,999
Please!

775
01:06:24,999 --> 01:06:28,999
Please! Please...

776
01:07:04,999 --> 01:07:08,998
Schumaker. <i>They found your boy Nick.
He's on his way to the station.</i>

777
01:07:08,999 --> 01:07:12,999
Oh, great. Ray, thank you.
I'll be here.

778
01:07:21,999 --> 01:07:23,998
<i>He's gonna come back
and kill us.</i>

779
01:07:23,999 --> 01:07:26,998
I know he is. Stop.

780
01:07:26,999 --> 01:07:29,998
The detective, she's smart.

781
01:07:29,999 --> 01:07:31,999
She's gonna find us.

782
01:07:37,999 --> 01:07:40,998
What do you think those men are
doing to Kaylie right now?

783
01:07:40,999 --> 01:07:43,999
Thinking about that stuff
isn't gonna help anything.

784
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,999
We need to focus on how
we're gonna get out of here.

785
01:07:51,999 --> 01:07:53,998
<i>Why would they take her?</i>

786
01:07:53,999 --> 01:07:56,998
Her mom has money.
Maybe for ransom?

787
01:07:56,999 --> 01:07:58,999
Those men are sex traffickers.

788
01:08:00,999 --> 01:08:02,999
Was trying to sell us
into prostitution.

789
01:08:07,999 --> 01:08:10,999
That's why I need you to focus on
how we're gonna get out of here.

790
01:09:02,999 --> 01:09:05,998
John, I know you're standing
at the door. Open up.

791
01:09:05,999 --> 01:09:07,999
I have another box.

792
01:09:09,999 --> 01:09:12,998
Just... Just leave it.

793
01:09:12,999 --> 01:09:15,999
I saw you holding your arm.
Are you okay?

794
01:09:16,999 --> 01:09:19,998
I'm fine. Can I have
my box, please?

795
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:22,998
But you don't look fine.

796
01:09:22,999 --> 01:09:24,998
You're bloody.
What the hell happened?

797
01:09:24,999 --> 01:09:28,998
That looks nasty.
Please go away!

798
01:09:28,999 --> 01:09:30,998
Let me drive you to the doctor.
I can't go to a doctor!

799
01:09:30,999 --> 01:09:33,998
I just need it to stop bleeding

800
01:09:33,999 --> 01:09:34,998
so I can go...

801
01:09:34,999 --> 01:09:36,998
I have to take care
of something.

802
01:09:36,999 --> 01:09:39,998
What do you mean, you
can't go to the doctor?

803
01:09:39,999 --> 01:09:41,999
Were you doing
something illegal?

804
01:09:47,999 --> 01:09:49,998
John, listen.

805
01:09:49,999 --> 01:09:51,998
I've got friends
that can help you.

806
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:53,998
They don't ask questions,
they don't go to the cops.

807
01:09:53,999 --> 01:09:56,998
What kind of friends?

808
01:09:56,999 --> 01:09:58,998
All kinds.

809
01:09:58,999 --> 01:10:01,999
Anything you need done.

810
01:10:04,999 --> 01:10:06,999
Why don't you tell me
how you got cut?

811
01:10:12,999 --> 01:10:14,999
John, listen. Whatever
it is, I can help.

812
01:10:17,999 --> 01:10:20,998
I need...

813
01:10:20,999 --> 01:10:23,999
I need to find someone that
can get rid of two girls.

814
01:10:37,999 --> 01:10:39,999
Kill them?

815
01:10:42,999 --> 01:10:44,998
Sell them.

816
01:10:44,999 --> 01:10:47,999
I don't want them dead.
I want them sold.

817
01:10:49,999 --> 01:10:51,998
I had a deal with some
guys I found underground,

818
01:10:51,999 --> 01:10:53,998
but it didn't work out.

819
01:10:53,999 --> 01:10:56,998
What do you mean, "underground"?

820
01:10:56,999 --> 01:10:59,998
Tor. Silkroad. Darknet.
It doesn't matter.

821
01:10:59,999 --> 01:11:03,999
They were gonna give me ten grand
apiece, but they scammed me.

822
01:11:05,999 --> 01:11:09,998
If you know someone that can
do that, that can take them,

823
01:11:09,999 --> 01:11:13,999
then I can split
the money with you.

824
01:11:21,999 --> 01:11:24,998
Yeah, I know someone.

825
01:11:24,999 --> 01:11:26,998
He'll want to see them first.

826
01:11:26,999 --> 01:11:29,998
That's, that's fine. I just
want to get it over with.

827
01:11:29,999 --> 01:11:31,998
Where are they?
There're not here,

828
01:11:31,999 --> 01:11:33,998
but I can bring you to them.

829
01:11:33,999 --> 01:11:36,998
Okay.

830
01:11:36,999 --> 01:11:38,998
I'm gonna grab my cell,

831
01:11:38,999 --> 01:11:39,998
call them first,

832
01:11:39,999 --> 01:11:41,999
make sure we can
bring them tonight.

833
01:12:37,999 --> 01:12:39,998
He gave me a couple bucks,

834
01:12:39,999 --> 01:12:41,998
asked me to help him
play a prank on his niece.

835
01:12:41,999 --> 01:12:43,999
So, what else can you
tell me about him?

836
01:12:45,999 --> 01:12:47,998
Nick...

837
01:12:47,999 --> 01:12:49,998
listen,

838
01:12:49,999 --> 01:12:52,998
I think you could use
a friend on the force,

839
01:12:52,999 --> 01:12:56,998
and that's me.
But I need your help.

840
01:12:56,999 --> 01:12:58,999
Or I can charge you
as an accessory.

841
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:04,998
All right, look.

842
01:13:04,999 --> 01:13:07,998
I met the guy at a
house out in Ralston.

843
01:13:07,999 --> 01:13:10,998
I might still have his
address in my phone.

844
01:13:10,999 --> 01:13:12,999
Find it.

845
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,999
You hear that? Someone's coming.

846
01:14:11,999 --> 01:14:12,998
Where are we going?

847
01:14:12,999 --> 01:14:15,999
You'll see.

848
01:14:27,999 --> 01:14:30,998
Hey, bitch, don't
even think about it.

849
01:14:30,999 --> 01:14:33,000
Don't even think about it.

850
01:14:40,999 --> 01:14:42,998
Let's go.

851
01:14:42,999 --> 01:14:44,999
Come on.

852
01:14:49,999 --> 01:14:53,000
Get out! Let's get the hell out!

853
01:15:01,999 --> 01:15:04,999
Mandy, get her gun!

854
01:15:13,999 --> 01:15:16,999
- Come on, let's go!
- Stop!

855
01:15:47,999 --> 01:15:50,999
Avery!

856
01:16:10,999 --> 01:16:11,998
Avery!

857
01:16:11,999 --> 01:16:13,999
Come on!

858
01:16:18,999 --> 01:16:20,999
Mandy!

859
01:16:22,999 --> 01:16:25,998
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i>

860
01:16:25,999 --> 01:16:28,998
Hi. Um, my name
is Avery Lindstrom.

861
01:16:28,999 --> 01:16:30,998
Mandy Kim and I
have been kidnapped,

862
01:16:30,999 --> 01:16:32,998
and we're hiding in a
warehouse, I don't know where,

863
01:16:32,999 --> 01:16:35,998
but he has a gun. <i>You said "he."</i>

864
01:16:35,999 --> 01:16:37,998
<i>Is there one person
or more than one?</i>

865
01:16:37,999 --> 01:16:40,999
Shh! He's coming.

866
01:16:58,999 --> 01:17:00,998
He just left, but we're hiding,

867
01:17:00,999 --> 01:17:04,999
I don't know, in some room
or something, I don't know.

868
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,998
<i>Mrs. Lindstrom,</i>

869
01:17:12,999 --> 01:17:15,998
<i>Nick gave us information
on the man who hired him,</i>

870
01:17:15,999 --> 01:17:17,998
so we're checking out
his house now.

871
01:17:17,999 --> 01:17:19,998
Are the girls there?

872
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:22,998
No, but we're combing the place...
Detective?

873
01:17:22,999 --> 01:17:25,998
<i>Detective Schumaker,
I've got Avery Lindstrom,</i>

874
01:17:25,999 --> 01:17:26,998
<i>one of the missing girls,
on the line.</i>

875
01:17:26,999 --> 01:17:28,998
<i>One of our girls?</i>

876
01:17:28,999 --> 01:17:31,998
Just give me a second, okay?
Don't go away.

877
01:17:31,999 --> 01:17:34,999
Can dispatch put the call through to me?
<i>Copy that.</i>

878
01:17:47,999 --> 01:17:49,998
<i>You're connected, Schumaker.</i>

879
01:17:49,999 --> 01:17:51,998
Avery? <i>Yes.</i>

880
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:53,998
This is Detective Schumaker.
Are you hurt?

881
01:17:53,999 --> 01:17:57,998
No, and neither is Mandy,
but Kaylie's gone.

882
01:17:57,999 --> 01:18:00,998
Some men took her, and this phone
belongs to a woman he killed.

883
01:18:00,999 --> 01:18:03,998
<i>Okay, honey, now, listen. We're
sending units out to you now,</i>

884
01:18:03,999 --> 01:18:06,998
but I need you to stay on
the phone a little longer.

885
01:18:06,999 --> 01:18:08,998
I'm going to patch you
through to your mother.

886
01:18:08,999 --> 01:18:10,998
Hold on.

887
01:18:10,999 --> 01:18:12,998
Mrs. Lindstrom. Yes?

888
01:18:12,999 --> 01:18:15,998
<i>I have Avery
on the phone for you.</i>

889
01:18:15,999 --> 01:18:17,998
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Avery?

890
01:18:17,999 --> 01:18:21,998
Mom? <i>Avery, honey, are you okay?
Did he hurt you?</i>

891
01:18:21,999 --> 01:18:24,999
No, Mom, I'm okay. I'm so sorry.

892
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,998
Honey, it's okay. It's okay.

893
01:18:27,999 --> 01:18:30,999
<i>It's okay, honey. I love you.
</i> I love you, too.

894
01:18:36,999 --> 01:18:39,998
<i>Is it possible for you two girls
to get out of the building?</i>

895
01:18:39,999 --> 01:18:41,998
We don't know where he is?
We'll try.

896
01:18:41,999 --> 01:18:44,998
Keep the phone on, and if it's
not safe, stay where you are.

897
01:18:44,999 --> 01:18:46,999
Okay.

898
01:19:13,999 --> 01:19:15,999
Keep going!

899
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,999
Avery!

900
01:20:03,999 --> 01:20:05,998
Hey! They're here!

901
01:20:05,999 --> 01:20:08,998
- I've got the girls.
<i>- What is your 10-20?</i>

902
01:20:08,999 --> 01:20:12,999
31225 Industrial Park Road West.
Suspect is still inside.

903
01:20:57,999 --> 01:21:01,998
Shots fired, my location!

904
01:21:01,999 --> 01:21:03,999
<i>10-76 sending in.</i>

905
01:21:05,999 --> 01:21:08,999
Stay down. Help is on the way.

906
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,998
Schumaker. Heidemann. Hey.

907
01:21:26,999 --> 01:21:28,998
Hey. That's how we found him.

908
01:21:28,999 --> 01:21:30,998
Pretty sure it's John.

909
01:21:30,999 --> 01:21:32,998
Can't tell by
looking at his face.

910
01:21:32,999 --> 01:21:34,998
Close-range gunshot
wound to the head?

911
01:21:34,999 --> 01:21:36,998
Self-inflicted.

912
01:21:36,999 --> 01:21:39,998
Give forensics a couple of hours
before you call the coroner.

913
01:21:39,999 --> 01:21:41,998
I'm gonna visit Avery
at the hospital.

914
01:21:41,999 --> 01:21:44,999
Hopefully, we can figure out who
took the other girl. You got it.

915
01:21:49,999 --> 01:21:52,998
So, Avery, you said you
saw two men take Kaylie.

916
01:21:52,999 --> 01:21:55,998
Did you see anything else
in the area?

917
01:21:55,999 --> 01:21:58,998
Did you see their faces?
Avery! Oh, Avery!

918
01:21:58,999 --> 01:22:01,999
Mom! Oh, honey! Oh, my God!

919
01:22:06,999 --> 01:22:08,999
I love you.

920
01:22:12,999 --> 01:22:14,998
<i>It's been seven months,</i>

921
01:22:14,999 --> 01:22:16,998
<i>and no one has seen
or heard from Kaylie.</i>

922
01:22:16,999 --> 01:22:19,998
<i>The police found nothing
in John's stuff</i>

923
01:22:19,999 --> 01:22:23,998
<i>that would tell them
who the men were that took her.</i>

924
01:22:23,999 --> 01:22:25,998
<i>They believe he found them
on the Darknet,</i>

925
01:22:25,999 --> 01:22:27,999
<i>but that's all they know.</i>

926
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:31,998
<i>Suddenly, everyone was
so interested in John,</i>

927
01:22:31,999 --> 01:22:33,998
<i>who he was,</i>

928
01:22:33,999 --> 01:22:36,998
<i>why he did what he did.</i>

929
01:22:36,999 --> 01:22:38,998
<i>People become
more interested in you</i>

930
01:22:38,999 --> 01:22:41,998
<i>after you do something horrible.</i>

931
01:22:41,999 --> 01:22:43,998
It's so hard to believe. I mean,

932
01:22:43,999 --> 01:22:46,998
the John I knew, he would
never do something like this.

933
01:22:46,999 --> 01:22:48,998
He would never hurt a fly.

934
01:22:48,999 --> 01:22:51,998
He was so shy and kind. He...

935
01:22:51,999 --> 01:22:53,998
This was the last thing
we expected from him.

936
01:22:53,999 --> 01:22:57,998
<i>The media never reported
how we really met John.</i>

937
01:22:57,999 --> 01:23:00,999
<i>They said he found us
using social media.</i>

938
01:23:04,999 --> 01:23:06,998
<i>The reality is, we found him.</i>

939
01:23:06,999 --> 01:23:09,999
<i>We preyed on him.</i>

940
01:23:11,999 --> 01:23:13,998
<i>If you poke a lion with a stick,</i>

941
01:23:13,999 --> 01:23:16,998
<i>is it his fault
for attacking you?</i>

942
01:23:16,999 --> 01:23:18,998
<i>I'm not saying any of us
deserved what he did.</i>

943
01:23:18,999 --> 01:23:20,998
<i>Nothing gives you the right
to hurt someone else,</i>

944
01:23:20,999 --> 01:23:22,999
<i>even if they bully you.</i>

945
01:23:26,999 --> 01:23:28,998
<i>But that goes for Kaylie, too.</i>

946
01:23:28,999 --> 01:23:30,998
<i>She had no right
to hurt him either,</i>

947
01:23:30,999 --> 01:23:33,998
<i>and if she hadn't,
maybe she'd still be here.</i>
