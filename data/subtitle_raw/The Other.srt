1
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:30,335
Cripes! It's old lady Rowe!

2
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:32,963
Come on.

3
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:42,604
Holland?

4
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:46,717
- <i>Holland!</i>
- Keep watch.

5
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:55,861
<i>It's okay. Go ahead.</i>

6
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:00,858
Cripe's sake! Hurry up!

7
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:15,445
- Aha! I finally caught you, Holland Perry!
- I'm Niles!

8
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:18,916
I don't care if you're Franklin Delano Roosevelt,
the dirty Democrat!

9
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,146
You stay out of my piccalilli farrago!

10
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,154
Let me go! Let me go!

11
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:25,156
No sass, boy. No sass!

12
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:28,216
You're gonna go in there
and clean up that mess. Hear me?

13
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:38,365
Rats! Rats! Rats!

14
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:41,236
Hundreds of rats! My God!

15
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:44,003
We'll all be down
with bubonic plague!

16
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:47,410
Holland Perry, I'm going to
tell your father on you!

17
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:52,782
<i>Set your foot on my farm, Holland Perry,</i>
<i>and I'll do more than take my rug beater to ya!</i>

18
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:56,583
<i>Do you hear?</i>
<i>I'm going to tell your father on you!</i>

19
00:05:56,656 --> 00:06:00,148
<i>Geez, someone oughta</i>
<i>tell her Father's dead.</i>

20
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:03,319
Let's go. Apple cellar!

21
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:06,991
Wait! Cousin Piggy's out there.

22
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:23,914
Hey, Winnie! There's Niles!

23
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:26,577
Niles!

24
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:29,587
<i>Niles! Niles Perry,!</i>

25
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:33,989
<i>You know your grandmother doesn't want</i>
<i>you boys playing in that barn!</i>

26
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:37,722
Niles, do you hear me?

27
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:40,856
<i>You'll miss lunch.</i>

28
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:42,867
Get on up here right now.

29
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:45,665
Niles, files, run 20 miles!

30
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:49,105
<i>Tee-legged, tie-legged,</i>
<i>bow-legged Niles!</i>

31
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:52,269
Little pitchers has got big lips.

32
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:54,279
- Where you been?
- Around.

33
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:56,281
Hi, Uncle George.

34
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:58,943
What say, skipper?
Great day for the race, isn't it?

35
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:01,953
- What race?
- The human race!

36
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:05,090
What's got into Mrs. Rowe?

37
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:07,092
I never heard
such a caterwaulin'.

38
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,152
Thank God I don't have to work
for that crazy old thing.

39
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:14,098
There's one of
my sunshine boys now.

40
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:16,101
Hi, Aunt Vee.

41
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:19,104
Why don't you boys set up the card table
in the parlor, where it's cool...

42
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:21,106
and play mah-jongg?

43
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:23,608
Christ, Valeria,
kids don't wanna play mah-jongg.

44
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:27,112
It's summertime.
They wanna go ride old lady Rowe's cow.

45
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,114
Or is that <i>udder</i> nonsense?

46
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:32,117
- Yowsah, yowsah!
- Oh! George!

47
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:34,119
Russell, you'd better go hose off...

48
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:36,621
or you're gonna catch flies.

49
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:39,123
Hey, Rider!

50
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:41,126
Toonerville Trolley's leaving!

51
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:44,129
Niles, go tell that brother-in-law of yours
to get out here.

52
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:46,631
- We're both gonna get fired.
- Yowsah!

53
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:49,429
Yowsah! Yowsah!
Yowsah! Yowsah!

54
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:51,663
Yowsah! Yowsah!

55
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,774
Hi, Rider.
Hi, Sis.

56
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:57,776
<i>Hey, kiddo.</i>

57
00:07:57,844 --> 00:08:02,076
Eat! I swear, you kids must think
I'm runnin' a restaurant around here.

58
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:05,379
- <i>What's playing at the movies?</i>
- Bet we saw it.

59
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:07,385
I'll bet we didn't.

60
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:10,388
We saw it- <i>Naughty Marietta</i>
and <i>Murder in the Blue Room.</i>

61
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:13,550
- <i>Come on, Rider!</i>
- Comin'!

62
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:16,686
<i>You take care</i>
<i>of the son and heir.</i>

63
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:19,595
It's not gonna be a boy.
It's gonna be a girl. I told ya!

64
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:22,600
I know you told me,
but you don't say how you know.

65
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,728
He knows. Last year, on Mother's birthday,
he predicted a storm.

66
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:27,739
- <i>And what did we get?</i>
- Hail!

67
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:30,298
Hail Columbia is what somebody's gonna get
if they don't eat.

68
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:32,310
Eat!

69
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:35,313
- <i>Rider!</i>
- Oh, honey, bring home some sarsaparilla.

70
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:38,350
- I have a craving.
- God. Pregnant women.

71
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,286
Can I tune in?

72
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,345
Sure.

73
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:49,627
Yowsah. It's gonna be a girl.

74
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:52,220
You witch.

75
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:54,232
What's in the oven?

76
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,736
Ah! Them is
your grandmother's surprise.

77
00:08:57,803 --> 00:08:59,737
Eat!

78
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:03,842
Alexandra is ready for lunch.

79
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,844
Yes, ma'am. I know.

80
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:07,846
Let me take it up.

81
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:10,348
You're gonna have to sit
with Mrs. Alexander.

82
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:13,351
Make her eat.
Otherwise she won't touch a thing.

83
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:16,411
Niles, put the paper
under my arm.

84
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,825
Mmm!

85
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,157
That'll only upset her.

86
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:26,392
- Tell Mother I'll read to her later.
- All right.

87
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:43,872
Ouch! Oh!

88
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:48,376
<i>Did ya eat?</i>

89
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:51,719
Did ya eat?

90
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,339
Holland.

91
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:11,672
<i>Holland. You in here?</i>

92
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:14,975
<i>Damn you. What are you doing</i>
<i>in the dark anyway?</i>

93
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:17,743
I'm thinking.
Close the door.

94
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,485
<i>Thinking? About what?</i>

95
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:26,582
<i>Old lady Rowe.</i>
<i>Damned old bitch!</i>

96
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:40,762
<i>What is it?</i>

97
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,774
<i>A snowman.</i>

98
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:44,833
<i>Ada made it.</i>

99
00:10:58,357 --> 00:11:01,656
People always call it a hawk.

100
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:03,922
It's really a peregrine falcon.

101
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:09,099
Peregrine for Perry.

102
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,728
It is my ring, isn't it?

103
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:14,238
You gave it to me, didn't you?

104
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:18,174
Cripe's sake, yes.
I gave it to ya.

105
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:20,474
Now, will you forget
about the ring.

106
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:22,070
Just wanted to make sure.

107
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:25,549
Look, the ring
was granddaddy's.

108
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:29,714
When he died, it went to Father,
'cause he was the oldest.

109
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:32,223
Then when Father got killed
I got it...

110
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:34,225
because I was the oldest.

111
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:36,557
Only by 20 minutes.

112
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:38,563
I'm still the oldest.

113
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:41,395
So I can do anything
I want to do with it. Can't I?

114
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:46,234
I <i>told you you can have it.</i>
<i>It's yours, and</i> I <i>don't ever want it back.</i>

115
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:53,611
What about this?

116
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:55,977
<i>Shut up about that.</i>

117
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,846
If you ever tell anybody on me-

118
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:00,909
Shh! Listen!

119
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:10,028
I thought so.
You <i>are</i> playing in here.

120
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:12,326
<i>You know we're not supposed to.</i>

121
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,332
<i>What's that?</i>

122
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,334
<i>That's Grandpa Perry's ring...</i>

123
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,495
<i>and it's supposed</i>
<i>to be buried.</i>

124
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,267
I'm gonna tell. You just wait until
my daddy gets home.

125
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,934
<i>You just see if</i> I <i>don't tell.</i>

126
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:35,519
Holland.
H-He saw the ring.

127
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,522
I know.

128
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,150
Don't worry, little brother.

129
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:44,185
- He's gonna tell Uncle George.
- No, he's not.

130
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,857
You can have the ring back.

131
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,923
This too.

132
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:52,828
Take 'em.

133
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:55,703
I don't want 'em, Niles.
I gave 'em to you.

134
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:59,006
<i>Come on, little brother.</i>
<i>Let's get outta here.</i>

135
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:11,416
<i>Father.</i>

136
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:23,195
- <i>Father.</i>
- <i>Hey, Niles! What you doin'? Now, come on!</i>

137
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:37,572
I'm gonna tell!

138
00:14:07,977 --> 00:14:11,572
Only Piggy Lookadoo
would have rats for pets.

139
00:14:11,648 --> 00:14:13,616
<i>Rats for a rat.</i>

140
00:14:19,155 --> 00:14:23,251
Come on, Holland.
Let's get outta here.

141
00:15:05,001 --> 00:15:06,992
You killed it, Holland.

142
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:09,595
<i>You killed it.</i>

143
00:15:28,158 --> 00:15:30,149
Mother!

144
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:33,192
<i>Mother!</i>

145
00:15:36,433 --> 00:15:38,663
Niles.

146
00:15:43,406 --> 00:15:46,500
Mother, you came down.

147
00:15:46,576 --> 00:15:48,874
So I did.

148
00:15:48,945 --> 00:15:50,879
Are these for me?

149
00:15:50,947 --> 00:15:53,643
Yes. Just for you.

150
00:15:53,716 --> 00:15:55,650
How lovely.
From Ada's garden?

151
00:15:55,718 --> 00:15:57,811
Mm-hmm.

152
00:15:57,887 --> 00:16:00,720
Mother, come and sit.

153
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,724
Please sit and talk.

154
00:16:02,792 --> 00:16:05,727
- But I'm not dressed.
- No one will see.

155
00:16:05,795 --> 00:16:08,787
- Just the two of us.
- All right.

156
00:16:16,773 --> 00:16:19,708
It's all right,
Mother. Please!

157
00:16:19,776 --> 00:16:21,573
No.

158
00:16:21,644 --> 00:16:23,908
I can't. Not today.

159
00:16:28,485 --> 00:16:30,919
What have you been
doing today?

160
00:16:30,987 --> 00:16:34,150
Oh.

161
00:16:34,224 --> 00:16:36,249
Reading, as usual.

162
00:16:36,326 --> 00:16:38,260
You still reading
<i>The Good Earth?</i>

163
00:16:38,328 --> 00:16:41,024
Forever <i>The Good Earth.</i>

164
00:16:41,097 --> 00:16:43,998
The librarian says
she'll get <i>Anthony Adverse.</i>

165
00:16:44,067 --> 00:16:46,001
Maybe Monday.

166
00:16:46,069 --> 00:16:49,937
Monday.
Now, what's today? Wednesday.

167
00:16:50,006 --> 00:16:52,440
I hope the ashes went out.

168
00:16:52,509 --> 00:16:57,242
It's Friday- fish night.
And it's summer.

169
00:16:58,248 --> 00:16:59,977
No ashes.

170
00:17:00,049 --> 00:17:02,279
Of course. How stupid!

171
00:17:04,053 --> 00:17:06,487
Your birthdays are in March.

172
00:17:08,057 --> 00:17:09,991
I remember.

173
00:17:10,059 --> 00:17:12,994
You and Holland both
got those cowboy outfits...

174
00:17:13,062 --> 00:17:16,054
with the fancy stitching
on the boots and-

175
00:17:23,806 --> 00:17:25,603
What's that?

176
00:17:25,675 --> 00:17:28,109
Just some stuff.

177
00:17:28,177 --> 00:17:30,168
It was Father's.

178
00:17:45,662 --> 00:17:48,654
Mother, are you okay?

179
00:17:50,733 --> 00:17:52,724
Yes, of course, darling.

180
00:17:53,836 --> 00:17:56,361
<i>Russell!</i>

181
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,931
Russell!

182
00:18:00,009 --> 00:18:02,944
Niles, I need a spool
of mercerized cotton.

183
00:18:03,012 --> 00:18:05,947
Can Russell borrow your bicycle
and go to town and get it?

184
00:18:06,015 --> 00:18:08,950
Sure, Aunt Vee,
only it's got a flat.

185
00:18:09,018 --> 00:18:11,452
- Can he borrow Holland's then?
- Sure, Aunt Vee.

186
00:18:11,521 --> 00:18:13,352
Thank you, dear.

187
00:18:13,423 --> 00:18:15,220
Russell!

188
00:18:16,926 --> 00:18:18,860
<i>Russell!</i>

189
00:18:18,928 --> 00:18:21,863
<i>Russell, where are you?</i>

190
00:18:21,931 --> 00:18:23,922
<i>Answer me!</i>

191
00:18:34,577 --> 00:18:39,480
<i>I'm king of the mountain!</i>
<i>I'm king of the mountain!</i>

192
00:18:39,549 --> 00:18:43,144
Hey, Piggy! Your mother
wants you to go to the store.

193
00:19:10,947 --> 00:19:14,110
Piggy Lookadoo's
gonna ride your bike!

194
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:31,298
Dushechka. Dushechka!

195
00:19:31,367 --> 00:19:33,927
<i>Baboushka!</i>

196
00:19:48,651 --> 00:19:50,881
<i>Dobryi dyen, baboushka.</i>

197
00:19:50,953 --> 00:19:53,148
<i>Dobryi dyen.</i>

198
00:19:53,222 --> 00:19:57,158
What are you doing there
all by yourself? Did you fish?

199
00:19:57,226 --> 00:19:59,820
Not yet.

200
00:19:59,896 --> 00:20:01,830
Summer sure is long.

201
00:20:01,898 --> 00:20:04,662
Life is long, child.

202
00:20:04,734 --> 00:20:07,328
I hate shad.

203
00:20:07,403 --> 00:20:09,428
I prefer the roe.

204
00:20:09,505 --> 00:20:11,439
Roe! Ecch!

205
00:20:11,507 --> 00:20:13,441
Like polliwog eggs.

206
00:20:13,509 --> 00:20:16,945
Such a face!
<i>Dushechka,</i> you are a clown.

207
00:20:17,013 --> 00:20:20,005
Why do you boys
not play together?

208
00:20:23,152 --> 00:20:26,781
Holland doesn't like
Piggy Lookadoo.

209
00:20:26,856 --> 00:20:29,086
Does he not?

210
00:20:29,158 --> 00:20:32,594
Perhaps summer is long
for Russell too.

211
00:20:32,662 --> 00:20:35,654
Why doesn't Holland
like Russell?

212
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:39,063
Child?

213
00:20:39,135 --> 00:20:41,126
Answer me.

214
00:20:42,605 --> 00:20:46,541
Do sunflowers
really follow the sun all day?

215
00:20:48,611 --> 00:20:50,602
A Russian superstition, perhaps.

216
00:20:53,983 --> 00:20:56,781
You miss Russia, don't you?

217
00:20:57,854 --> 00:21:00,448
Sometimes.

218
00:21:00,523 --> 00:21:05,756
But God does not mean that we should
miss too much what he takes from us.

219
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:10,665
Besides, now...

220
00:21:10,733 --> 00:21:13,896
I have other sunflowers.

221
00:21:17,273 --> 00:21:19,207
Ada...

222
00:21:19,275 --> 00:21:22,108
can I be something else today?

223
00:21:22,178 --> 00:21:24,942
Bigger than a flower.

224
00:21:25,014 --> 00:21:26,948
Please?

225
00:21:27,016 --> 00:21:29,644
Let's play the game.
The great game.

226
00:21:29,719 --> 00:21:31,846
The great game, is it?

227
00:21:31,921 --> 00:21:34,822
Please? Please?

228
00:21:34,891 --> 00:21:36,825
Very well.

229
00:21:36,893 --> 00:21:39,691
The great game it shall be.

230
00:21:39,762 --> 00:21:41,753
- Oh, boy!
- Come on.

231
00:21:58,281 --> 00:22:00,442
Look there, child.

232
00:22:02,819 --> 00:22:04,912
<i>Look.</i>

233
00:22:07,156 --> 00:22:09,317
Try to be.

234
00:22:12,361 --> 00:22:16,297
Now think as I have taught you.

235
00:22:18,434 --> 00:22:20,994
Look hard.

236
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:23,800
Feel inside it...

237
00:22:23,873 --> 00:22:27,070
<i>into its head, its heart.</i>

238
00:22:27,143 --> 00:22:30,442
Imagine it, <i>dushechka.</i>

239
00:22:31,447 --> 00:22:33,438
Imagine it.

240
00:22:33,516 --> 00:22:36,644
<i>With all your being...</i>

241
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,654
you do feel.

242
00:22:39,722 --> 00:22:42,885
Now.

243
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:47,322
Now!

244
00:22:49,999 --> 00:22:51,933
<i>Then fly!</i>

245
00:22:54,003 --> 00:22:56,767
<i>Away! Away!</i>

246
00:22:56,839 --> 00:22:59,831
<i>Away, child.</i>

247
00:23:06,716 --> 00:23:09,241
It's scary!

248
00:23:09,318 --> 00:23:13,311
<i>Don't be frightened.</i>
<i>What is it like? Tell me!</i>

249
00:23:13,389 --> 00:23:14,981
Free!

250
00:23:16,492 --> 00:23:18,460
Mr. Angelini!

251
00:23:18,527 --> 00:23:21,291
<i>Look! Look at me!</i>

252
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,665
Niles, what is it?

253
00:24:02,104 --> 00:24:05,596
- It hurt.
- Where does it hurt? Tell me.

254
00:24:07,576 --> 00:24:10,010
It-

255
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:12,445
It was just sh-

256
00:24:12,515 --> 00:24:16,007
pointy, all sharp- pointy.

257
00:24:16,085 --> 00:24:18,019
Here.

258
00:24:18,087 --> 00:24:21,147
- Oh.
- L-It's all right, Ada. Honest.

259
00:24:25,494 --> 00:24:27,428
Did I do good?

260
00:24:27,496 --> 00:24:29,430
Oh, very good.

261
00:24:29,498 --> 00:24:32,934
- Good as Holland?
- Better than anyone.

262
00:24:33,002 --> 00:24:34,936
I love you.

263
00:24:35,004 --> 00:24:38,201
Oh, I love you too.

264
00:24:38,274 --> 00:24:41,539
Come now. Let us get you
some root beer.

265
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:46,104
I'm gonna catch a shad
with lots of roe for you!

266
00:24:51,587 --> 00:24:53,418
I'm king of the mountain!

267
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:10,963
I'm sorry, boy.

268
00:26:12,101 --> 00:26:14,092
I'm just so sorry.

269
00:26:15,604 --> 00:26:17,629
It's all right, Mr. Angelini.

270
00:26:18,774 --> 00:26:20,708
It wasn't your fault.

271
00:26:20,776 --> 00:26:22,710
It was an accident.

272
00:27:44,093 --> 00:27:48,223
Oh. Are we going to be able
to go to the firemen's carnival?

273
00:27:48,297 --> 00:27:50,925
Geez! Why not?

274
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,560
Ada says we're in mourning again.

275
00:27:53,636 --> 00:27:56,764
"Ada says. Ada says."

276
00:27:59,441 --> 00:28:01,534
There's seven years bad luck.

277
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:04,602
See what Ada says
about that.

278
00:28:56,665 --> 00:28:58,826
<i>Hurry, folks!</i>

279
00:28:58,901 --> 00:29:01,768
<i>Take home</i>
<i>a five-pound box of candy!</i>

280
00:29:01,837 --> 00:29:03,862
<i>Here it is!</i>
<i>Take home some candy!</i>

281
00:29:03,939 --> 00:29:06,032
<i>All rides are 10 cents!</i>

282
00:29:06,108 --> 00:29:09,009
<i>Don't you ever get hungry</i>
<i>Get a Coney Island red hot!</i>

283
00:29:09,078 --> 00:29:12,309
<i>And help yourself to the mustard!</i>

284
00:29:12,381 --> 00:29:16,181
<i>Big, fat and juicy Coney Island red hots!</i>
<i>And cold drinks, folks!</i>

285
00:29:16,252 --> 00:29:19,187
<i>All right, folks, come over!</i>

286
00:29:19,255 --> 00:29:22,190
<i>Tell you what you're</i>
<i>gonna see on this side!</i>

287
00:29:22,258 --> 00:29:25,193
<i>From the four corners of the world,</i>
<i>and at great expense to the management...</i>

288
00:29:25,261 --> 00:29:28,890
<i>we have brought together some of the most</i>
<i>unusual attractions ever seen under one roof...</i>

289
00:29:28,964 --> 00:29:31,296
and all for the price
of one admission.

290
00:29:31,367 --> 00:29:33,301
<i>You're going to meet Big Bertha!</i>

291
00:29:33,369 --> 00:29:36,805
Four hundred and fifty pounds
of beauty on the hoof.

292
00:29:36,872 --> 00:29:39,966
Yes, sir, she shimmies,
she shakes like a bowl of jelly.

293
00:29:40,042 --> 00:29:42,977
<i>And as an extra added attraction,</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen...</i>

294
00:29:43,045 --> 00:29:45,980
<i>we're going to bring to you</i>
<i>nature's cruelest trick-</i>

295
00:29:46,048 --> 00:29:47,982
the hydrocephalic baby,
ladies and gentlemen.

296
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:50,984
Plus Mr. And Mrs. Katz-

297
00:29:51,117 --> 00:29:52,550
<i>Niles! Come on!</i>

298
00:29:52,618 --> 00:29:54,745
- <i>Plus Bo-Jo, the dog-faced boy!</i>
- Come on!

299
00:29:54,821 --> 00:29:58,552
<i>Plus the two-faced man!</i>
<i>All on the inside, ladies and gentlemen!</i>

300
00:29:58,624 --> 00:30:00,558
<i>All for the price</i>
<i>of one admission!</i>

301
00:30:00,626 --> 00:30:04,494
- We're gonna get caught!
- <i>Damn it, Niles. Come on!</i>

302
00:30:04,564 --> 00:30:06,498
Oh, damn!

303
00:30:06,566 --> 00:30:08,557
<i>Hurry, hurry, hurry,!</i>

304
00:30:52,512 --> 00:30:55,276
<i>Fun house!</i>
<i>More fun than a circus!</i>

305
00:30:55,348 --> 00:30:58,476
<i>Come in! Stay as long as you like!</i>
<i>Come out when you're ready!</i>

306
00:31:08,294 --> 00:31:11,661
Come on, Holland. Let's scram.

307
00:31:23,643 --> 00:31:26,635
<i>Holland! Holland! Wait!</i>

308
00:31:54,273 --> 00:31:56,935
<i>Hold on!</i>

309
00:31:59,412 --> 00:32:02,313
- Shh.
- What's going on?

310
00:32:02,381 --> 00:32:04,508
I'm waiting for her
to disappear.

311
00:32:04,584 --> 00:32:07,849
Don't be a dumbbell.
No one can do that.

312
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:11,219
I know! I wanna find out
how he does it.

313
00:32:15,094 --> 00:32:17,528
<i>It's just a stupid trick.</i>

314
00:32:17,597 --> 00:32:20,361
He ain't even a Chinese.

315
00:32:20,433 --> 00:32:22,367
He's got tape on his eyes.

316
00:32:22,435 --> 00:32:24,369
<i>So? Come on. Let's go.</i>

317
00:32:24,437 --> 00:32:27,167
<i>No, wait!</i>
I <i>gotta figure it out.</i>

318
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,676
- Yeah? How?
- I'll play the game on him.

319
00:33:49,288 --> 00:33:52,155
Damn phony.

320
00:33:55,528 --> 00:33:59,123
- <i>We saw a magician today.</i>
<i>- Oh, did you, now?</i>

321
00:33:59,198 --> 00:34:01,063
Only it was a dumb fake.

322
00:34:01,133 --> 00:34:03,067
How do you know this?

323
00:34:03,135 --> 00:34:06,571
I played the game on him
and figured out the trick.

324
00:34:06,639 --> 00:34:12,077
Holland didn't believe me.
But I really did. It was easy.

325
00:34:12,144 --> 00:34:14,510
I mean, sometimes
it's so easy...

326
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:17,515
it doesn't seem like
I'm doing it at all.

327
00:34:17,583 --> 00:34:20,518
It is a special game
for special people.

328
00:34:20,586 --> 00:34:23,521
My <i>baboushka</i> taught me,
and I taught you children.

329
00:34:23,589 --> 00:34:26,023
But sometimes
I don't know how I do it.

330
00:34:26,092 --> 00:34:28,026
Of course you know.

331
00:34:28,094 --> 00:34:31,495
I've told you.
There is no trick to it. Just imagination.

332
00:34:31,564 --> 00:34:35,364
But do not play the game
too much, <i>dushechka. Da?</i>

333
00:34:35,434 --> 00:34:38,597
There are other things
in life besides the game.

334
00:34:38,671 --> 00:34:41,469
And children should play
with other children.

335
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,474
But I like to play
with Holland.

336
00:34:43,542 --> 00:34:46,443
But you should make
other friends.

337
00:34:46,512 --> 00:34:48,275
Holland's my friend.

338
00:34:48,347 --> 00:34:50,838
Sing to me, please.

339
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:54,909
Oh.

340
00:35:21,047 --> 00:35:25,347
Now it is time for
all good boys to be in bed.

341
00:35:25,418 --> 00:35:27,409
Butterfly kiss?

342
00:35:33,392 --> 00:35:35,690
<i>And tomorrow...</i>

343
00:35:35,761 --> 00:35:38,559
it will be time for all bad boys...

344
00:35:38,631 --> 00:35:40,565
to make apologies to Mrs. Rowe.

345
00:35:40,633 --> 00:35:43,158
I <i>saw her today.</i>

346
00:35:43,235 --> 00:35:45,169
And in the morning...

347
00:35:45,237 --> 00:35:49,105
her damaged preserves
will be replaced in person...

348
00:35:49,175 --> 00:35:52,008
<i>by the one responsible.</i>

349
00:35:53,279 --> 00:35:55,213
I'll tell Holland.

350
00:35:55,281 --> 00:35:57,613
<i>Please be sure he understands.</i>

351
00:36:27,646 --> 00:36:30,706
<i>I'm coming!</i>

352
00:36:30,783 --> 00:36:32,978
Good afternoon, madam.

353
00:36:33,052 --> 00:36:35,714
What is this? Halloween?

354
00:36:35,788 --> 00:36:37,722
- This is for you.
- For me?

355
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:39,724
What is it?

356
00:36:39,792 --> 00:36:41,726
- For the piccalilli I broke.
- Piccalilli?

357
00:36:41,794 --> 00:36:45,389
- And I came to apologize.
- Oh, I remember you.

358
00:36:45,464 --> 00:36:48,126
- Where's the other one?
- Niles won't come.

359
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,931
He says I broke it,
so I had to apologize.

360
00:36:52,004 --> 00:36:53,995
Huh. I accept it.

361
00:36:55,508 --> 00:36:57,442
May I come in, please?

362
00:36:57,510 --> 00:37:00,445
- You want to come in?
- Yes, please.

363
00:37:00,513 --> 00:37:02,447
Well, all right.

364
00:37:02,515 --> 00:37:04,449
You can come in.

365
00:37:08,621 --> 00:37:10,555
My, my.

366
00:37:10,623 --> 00:37:13,558
You boys have grown so.

367
00:37:13,626 --> 00:37:15,787
- Here you are.
- Thank you, ma'am.

368
00:37:33,412 --> 00:37:36,711
You're musical!

369
00:37:36,782 --> 00:37:38,613
I play the piano.

370
00:37:38,684 --> 00:37:41,812
- I can do tricks too.
- What kind of tricks?

371
00:37:41,887 --> 00:37:44,981
Shh.
I'll show you.

372
00:37:45,057 --> 00:37:47,287
All right.

373
00:37:57,069 --> 00:37:58,900
What are you doing there, Holland?

374
00:37:58,971 --> 00:38:02,702
Shh. It's a better light
for the trick.

375
00:38:02,775 --> 00:38:05,073
Oh.

376
00:38:08,614 --> 00:38:11,242
Shh.

377
00:38:22,628 --> 00:38:25,028
You're very mysterious, aren't you?

378
00:38:25,097 --> 00:38:28,032
Shh.

379
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:32,002
<i>You're not going to pull</i>
<i>a rabbit out of there, are you?</i>

380
00:38:32,071 --> 00:38:33,766
No. Guess again.

381
00:39:37,937 --> 00:39:39,871
I got your pain pills.

382
00:39:39,939 --> 00:39:42,601
Oh, my child, thank you.

383
00:39:46,145 --> 00:39:48,636
Why do people have to die?

384
00:39:49,982 --> 00:39:53,748
Well, all of life must die.

385
00:39:53,819 --> 00:39:55,753
'Tis nature's way.

386
00:39:55,821 --> 00:39:57,755
Every bird...

387
00:39:57,823 --> 00:39:59,757
every tree, every flower...

388
00:39:59,825 --> 00:40:01,759
has its time.

389
00:40:01,827 --> 00:40:03,954
They put you in the ground.

390
00:40:04,029 --> 00:40:08,466
As we come from the earth,
so we are returned to it.

391
00:40:08,534 --> 00:40:11,526
I don't like
to think about that.

392
00:40:16,108 --> 00:40:18,542
When I was very young,
like you...

393
00:40:18,611 --> 00:40:21,546
I was frightened
of death too.

394
00:40:21,614 --> 00:40:24,549
So, to set my mind at peace...

395
00:40:24,617 --> 00:40:29,247
my <i>baboushka</i> told me when it came
time to die I must not be afraid.

396
00:40:29,321 --> 00:40:31,312
I must look for an angel...

397
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:34,325
who would come from paradise.

398
00:40:34,393 --> 00:40:36,793
And this angel would smile...

399
00:40:36,862 --> 00:40:40,161
and fold me
in her beautiful white wings...

400
00:40:40,232 --> 00:40:42,223
and carry me off to heaven.

401
00:40:43,636 --> 00:40:48,630
<i>Baboushka</i> called her-

402
00:40:48,707 --> 00:40:50,641
Which means...

403
00:40:50,709 --> 00:40:53,644
"the angel of the brighter day."

404
00:40:53,712 --> 00:40:56,647
And from that time
I was no longer afraid of death.

405
00:40:56,715 --> 00:40:58,649
You see?

406
00:40:58,717 --> 00:41:00,582
And when I came here...

407
00:41:00,653 --> 00:41:03,315
and found this church...

408
00:41:03,389 --> 00:41:06,517
this angel became for me...

409
00:41:06,592 --> 00:41:09,026
<i>the angel of the brighter day.</i>

410
00:41:09,094 --> 00:41:11,528
<i>You see?</i>

411
00:41:13,298 --> 00:41:16,699
Do you still believe
she will come?

412
00:41:16,769 --> 00:41:18,703
Oh, yes.

413
00:41:18,771 --> 00:41:21,831
Will the angel come for me
when I die?

414
00:41:21,907 --> 00:41:24,705
If you believe...

415
00:41:24,777 --> 00:41:26,938
then surely she will.

416
00:41:44,196 --> 00:41:47,393
<i>Thank you, Mr. Clifford.</i>

417
00:41:47,466 --> 00:41:49,457
Thank you, sir.

418
00:42:00,245 --> 00:42:01,974
Alexandra.

419
00:42:06,485 --> 00:42:09,477
Mr. Angelini,
can I borrow your clippers?

420
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:20,390
Thank you, Mr. Angelini.

421
00:42:23,802 --> 00:42:28,296
Here's the <i>Anthony Adverse</i>
at last!

422
00:42:28,373 --> 00:42:31,467
Thank you.
It's positively gargantuan!

423
00:42:31,543 --> 00:42:34,706
It'll take me all summer
to read this.

424
00:42:35,748 --> 00:42:38,182
I'll read to ya.

425
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:41,185
When you were younger,
I used to read to you two.

426
00:42:41,253 --> 00:42:43,187
Now you read to me.

427
00:42:43,255 --> 00:42:46,190
What was that story
you both used to love so?

428
00:42:46,258 --> 00:42:50,194
The one about the pig that got roasted with
an apple in his mouth- poor, greedy thing.

429
00:42:50,262 --> 00:42:52,196
One of Holland's favorites.

430
00:42:52,264 --> 00:42:54,357
That was Piggy Lookadoo.

431
00:42:55,367 --> 00:42:57,301
But Holland's real favorite...

432
00:42:57,369 --> 00:42:59,303
was the story
of the changeling.

433
00:42:59,371 --> 00:43:02,738
You know, the fairy tale
about the elves stealing the baby?

434
00:43:02,808 --> 00:43:05,743
It's a horrid story.
I don't like things like that.

435
00:43:05,811 --> 00:43:08,245
- What about <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin?</i>
- Terrific!

436
00:43:08,313 --> 00:43:10,907
Eliza crossing the ice
carrying her baby...

437
00:43:10,983 --> 00:43:14,077
and the dogs chasing her,
and then Simon Legree with his whip...

438
00:43:14,153 --> 00:43:16,087
and Topsy's eating watermelon...

439
00:43:16,155 --> 00:43:18,589
and little Eva dies
and goes to heaven.

440
00:43:18,657 --> 00:43:20,625
- Remember?
- I remember.

441
00:43:20,692 --> 00:43:24,321
And you said to me,
"Mother, what did you do in the Civil War?"

442
00:43:29,368 --> 00:43:31,666
Are you hoping?

443
00:43:32,971 --> 00:43:35,667
Yes, darling, I'm hoping.

444
00:43:35,741 --> 00:43:38,369
Everything is going
to be all right now.

445
00:43:38,443 --> 00:43:40,877
Everything's going to be all right.

446
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,814
- Guess what.
- What?

447
00:43:43,882 --> 00:43:46,817
We're gonna have another show
in the barn this summer.

448
00:43:46,885 --> 00:43:48,819
A magic show with a trick.

449
00:43:48,887 --> 00:43:51,253
- What kind of a trick?
- I can't tell.

450
00:43:51,323 --> 00:43:53,757
<i>We want it to be a surprise.</i>

451
00:43:53,826 --> 00:43:55,760
<i>Oh!</i>

452
00:43:55,828 --> 00:43:57,762
I have a present for you.

453
00:43:57,830 --> 00:44:01,425
- Another present?
- Close your eyes. Come on.

454
00:44:17,516 --> 00:44:21,509
Okay. You can open 'em now.

455
00:44:22,754 --> 00:44:26,417
Guess which one.
Left or right?

456
00:44:29,494 --> 00:44:32,429
- Left.
- Wrong.

457
00:44:32,497 --> 00:44:34,488
Open it.

458
00:44:36,935 --> 00:44:38,869
You have to warm them up.

459
00:44:38,937 --> 00:44:41,098
<i>It only takes a second.</i>

460
00:44:46,011 --> 00:44:48,946
They're Mexican
jumping beans, Mother.

461
00:44:49,014 --> 00:44:51,380
Don't you think
they're cheerful?

462
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:53,941
Yes, very.

463
00:45:03,725 --> 00:45:05,989
- Niles.
- Hmm?

464
00:45:06,061 --> 00:45:08,325
Do you know what this is?

465
00:45:08,397 --> 00:45:11,389
<i>Sure.</i>
<i>It's the family crest.</i>

466
00:45:11,466 --> 00:45:13,661
A peregrine falcon.

467
00:45:13,735 --> 00:45:15,669
"Peregrine" for Perry.

468
00:45:15,737 --> 00:45:17,830
Like the weather vane?

469
00:45:17,906 --> 00:45:19,737
Mm-hmm.

470
00:45:19,808 --> 00:45:21,742
And the ring?

471
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:23,744
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

472
00:45:25,814 --> 00:45:27,782
Here comes the vegetable man!

473
00:45:27,849 --> 00:45:30,249
<i>Corn and beans! Corn and beans!</i>

474
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:32,253
Succotash time!

475
00:45:32,321 --> 00:45:35,654
I gotta get Mr. Pretty his root beer,
or he'll have a conniption!

476
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:39,994
Don't you dare track dirt in.

477
00:45:40,062 --> 00:45:42,053
I just washed my linoleum.

478
00:46:04,353 --> 00:46:06,287
Here you go, Mr. Pretty!

479
00:46:06,355 --> 00:46:09,290
Well, thank you, Niles.
That'll sure wet my whistle.

480
00:46:09,358 --> 00:46:12,293
- Here.
- Thank you, Mr. Pretty!

481
00:46:12,361 --> 00:46:14,921
- <i>Now where you goin'?</i>
- Swimming!

482
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:20,168
You know,
I been wonderin' all week-

483
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:23,170
Your neighbor lady,
she go away or somethin'?

484
00:46:23,238 --> 00:46:25,832
Mrs. Rowe?
That's what we been wonderin'.

485
00:46:25,907 --> 00:46:28,842
Well, usually she boils up
a mess of tripe on Fridays...

486
00:46:28,910 --> 00:46:31,845
and I bring her
some dandelion greens for it.

487
00:46:31,913 --> 00:46:34,108
But I can't raise a soul.

488
00:46:34,182 --> 00:46:36,446
Well, between you and me...

489
00:46:37,719 --> 00:46:40,882
I don't think Mrs. Rowe's
such a good housekeeper.

490
00:46:40,956 --> 00:46:43,948
You wouldn't believe
the smell over there.

491
00:46:45,227 --> 00:46:47,491
<i>Let me have</i>
<i>a couple of cakes.</i>

492
00:46:47,562 --> 00:46:49,496
Swiss chard's nice today.

493
00:46:49,564 --> 00:46:51,964
<i>Mrs. Alexander</i>
<i>don't like Swiss chard.</i>

494
00:47:07,382 --> 00:47:10,317
Going for a dip.
Be back soon.

495
00:47:43,251 --> 00:47:46,186
<i>What's the last thing</i>
<i>you'd like to see...</i>

496
00:47:46,254 --> 00:47:48,188
<i>before you die?</i>

497
00:47:48,256 --> 00:47:50,190
<i>The last thing?</i>

498
00:47:50,258 --> 00:47:53,193
I <i>mean, if there was</i>
<i>one very last thing...</i>

499
00:47:53,261 --> 00:47:57,197
you could wish to see
before you die, what would it be?

500
00:47:57,265 --> 00:47:59,199
<i>Listen...</i>

501
00:47:59,267 --> 00:48:01,132
<i>if</i> I <i>was dying...</i>

502
00:48:01,203 --> 00:48:06,106
<i>I'd be too busy doing just that,</i>
<i>and so would you.</i>

503
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:08,904
I'd wish to see...

504
00:48:08,977 --> 00:48:10,911
her.

505
00:48:10,979 --> 00:48:14,415
- See who?
- The angel.

506
00:48:14,483 --> 00:48:18,317
You know.
Ada's angel in the church.

507
00:48:19,788 --> 00:48:22,416
Just before I died...

508
00:48:22,491 --> 00:48:25,085
the angel
would swoop down...

509
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:27,890
and take me in her wings...

510
00:48:27,963 --> 00:48:30,864
and carry me off to heaven.

511
00:48:30,932 --> 00:48:32,866
That's what Ada says.

512
00:48:32,934 --> 00:48:37,633
- How do you know she wouldn't take you to hell?
- Angels don't go to hell.

513
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:40,641
Only bad people do.

514
00:48:52,454 --> 00:48:55,150
<i>Come on, Niles, will ya!</i>

515
00:48:55,223 --> 00:48:57,157
<i>Wait a minute!</i>

516
00:48:57,225 --> 00:48:59,625
<i>I'm coming! I'm coming!</i>

517
00:49:14,709 --> 00:49:16,973
<i>That damn Uncle George.</i>

518
00:49:17,045 --> 00:49:19,980
<i>He said he was gonna do it,</i>
<i>and he did.</i>

519
00:49:20,048 --> 00:49:22,039
Come on.

520
00:49:53,215 --> 00:49:56,378
<i>Hey, Holland,</i>
<i>we get enough of this stuff...</i>

521
00:49:56,451 --> 00:50:00,046
we could use it to catch us
when we do the magic show.

522
00:50:00,121 --> 00:50:03,386
<i>You know, like a mattress.</i>
<i>Know what</i> I <i>mean?</i>

523
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:06,985
There isn't gonna be
any magic show. Not now.

524
00:50:07,062 --> 00:50:08,996
Why not?

525
00:50:09,064 --> 00:50:10,998
Figure it out, little brother.

526
00:50:11,066 --> 00:50:13,296
Think it all out.

527
00:50:13,368 --> 00:50:16,303
We build the stage
over the trap door...

528
00:50:16,371 --> 00:50:19,306
you turn the cabinet,
I drop down...

529
00:50:19,374 --> 00:50:21,308
<i>and then what happens?</i>

530
00:50:21,376 --> 00:50:24,311
You run out,
around the back stairs...

531
00:50:24,379 --> 00:50:28,315
and appear in the audience
like Chan-Yu did.

532
00:50:28,383 --> 00:50:31,910
- <i>Okay,</i> how <i>do</i> I <i>run out?</i>
- Through there.

533
00:50:33,754 --> 00:50:35,619
Through here?

534
00:50:40,227 --> 00:50:43,526
See what I mean?
That damn Uncle George.

535
00:50:44,865 --> 00:50:48,266
Well, we're gonna need
more cattails anyway.

536
00:50:48,335 --> 00:50:50,269
Lots of'em.

537
00:50:50,337 --> 00:50:51,929
So let's get 'em.

538
00:50:53,007 --> 00:50:54,736
<i>Come on.</i>

539
00:51:04,184 --> 00:51:07,915
<i>Hey! Come on, will ya!</i>

540
00:51:10,758 --> 00:51:14,524
Niles, we will eat soon.
Go wash. Put on some clothes.

541
00:51:14,595 --> 00:51:17,257
Right now?

542
00:51:19,099 --> 00:51:21,533
- Where are you going?
- To Mrs. Rowe.

543
00:51:21,602 --> 00:51:24,537
She's alone over there
and may have taken sick.

544
00:51:24,605 --> 00:51:27,836
Can I come?

545
00:52:06,914 --> 00:52:08,848
No! Child, don't look.

546
00:52:08,916 --> 00:52:12,511
Run. Go get your Uncle George.
Tell him to call the constable.

547
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:21,794
<i>She's dead!</i>

548
00:52:21,862 --> 00:52:23,796
- Who? Who?
- Who's dead?

549
00:52:23,864 --> 00:52:26,799
Old lady Rowe-
l-I mean, Mrs. Rowe!

550
00:52:26,867 --> 00:52:28,801
- Ada says come!
- Oh, my God.

551
00:52:28,869 --> 00:52:30,803
And call the constable!

552
00:52:30,871 --> 00:52:33,806
- <i>George. George!</i>
- Get on the phone.

553
00:52:33,874 --> 00:52:36,809
<i>George, come here!</i>

554
00:52:36,877 --> 00:52:40,438
- George, Mrs. Rowe is dead,
and Ada's over there alone.
- I'll be right there.

555
00:52:40,514 --> 00:52:42,448
Evelyn? It's Torrie Gannon.

556
00:52:42,516 --> 00:52:46,509
We've had some more trouble over here.
Can you locate the constable?

557
00:52:46,587 --> 00:52:49,522
<i>When you find him,</i>
<i>have him come to Mrs. Rowe's house...</i>

558
00:52:49,590 --> 00:52:51,717
<i>out on Valley Hill Road</i>
<i>right away.</i>

559
00:52:51,792 --> 00:52:54,124
<i>It's urgent. Thank you.</i>

560
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,854
I <i>told ya!</i> I <i>told ya!</i>

561
00:53:21,922 --> 00:53:24,356
I knew someone
would find that stuff!

562
00:53:24,424 --> 00:53:27,325
Goddamn it, Niles!
I told ya!

563
00:53:27,394 --> 00:53:29,328
You said she'd never find 'em.

564
00:53:29,396 --> 00:53:31,330
You said put 'em in the desk!

565
00:53:31,398 --> 00:53:34,993
- You said she'd never come in here!
- Never mind what I said.

566
00:53:35,068 --> 00:53:37,059
She found it, and she's got it.

567
00:53:37,137 --> 00:53:40,072
<i>She's got it, little brother...</i>

568
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:42,734
<i>and you'd better get it back.</i>

569
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:44,744
Get it back.

570
00:53:44,812 --> 00:53:46,905
I mean it.

571
00:53:52,753 --> 00:53:57,019
<i>Tell her you want it. It's yours.</i>
<i>It doesn't belong to her.</i>

572
00:53:57,090 --> 00:54:00,753
It was Father's ring.
I gave it to you. It's not hers.

573
00:54:02,129 --> 00:54:06,463
Yeah, but it's supposed to be buried.
She knows that.

574
00:54:17,277 --> 00:54:19,211
What are we gonna do?

575
00:54:19,279 --> 00:54:21,474
I <i>told you what to do.</i>
<i>Get it back.</i>

576
00:54:39,032 --> 00:54:41,660
Mother.

577
00:54:43,737 --> 00:54:46,535
Mother, come away.

578
00:54:46,607 --> 00:54:48,905
Mother, please.

579
00:54:48,976 --> 00:54:50,967
Please, Mother.

580
00:55:12,933 --> 00:55:16,425
Mother, you hurt your hand.

581
00:55:18,005 --> 00:55:19,939
Oh, Mother.

582
00:55:20,007 --> 00:55:22,771
You found the tobacco tin.

583
00:55:24,177 --> 00:55:26,304
L-I'm sorry.

584
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:29,008
Niles...

585
00:55:29,082 --> 00:55:32,017
what are you doing
with Father's ring?

586
00:55:32,085 --> 00:55:35,179
It was supposed
to have been buried.

587
00:55:35,255 --> 00:55:37,348
<i>Yes, Mother.</i>

588
00:55:37,424 --> 00:55:39,358
But-

589
00:55:39,426 --> 00:55:43,362
Tell me, Niles, please.
What are you doing with the ring?

590
00:55:43,430 --> 00:55:46,524
- It's mine.
- Yours?

591
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:48,534
How can it be yours?

592
00:55:48,602 --> 00:55:50,661
Holland gave it to me.

593
00:55:52,806 --> 00:55:55,536
H-He did, Mother. Honest.

594
00:55:55,609 --> 00:55:57,873
When?

595
00:55:57,945 --> 00:56:00,778
<i>When did Holland</i>
<i>give you the ring?</i>

596
00:56:00,847 --> 00:56:03,645
- In March.
- March?

597
00:56:03,717 --> 00:56:05,810
<i>When in March?</i>

598
00:56:05,886 --> 00:56:07,820
After our birthdays.

599
00:56:07,888 --> 00:56:11,824
After your... birthdays?

600
00:56:11,892 --> 00:56:14,520
<i>Where, Niles?</i>

601
00:56:14,594 --> 00:56:19,190
In the name of heaven, where was Holland
when he gave you the ring?

602
00:56:19,266 --> 00:56:21,166
We were in the front parlor.

603
00:56:21,234 --> 00:56:23,566
Did he give you this too?

604
00:56:26,974 --> 00:56:29,807
<i>Yes,</i> I <i>gave it to him.</i>

605
00:56:29,876 --> 00:56:31,867
Now give it back, Mother.

606
00:56:46,259 --> 00:56:50,059
<i>Ada! Ada!</i>

607
00:56:50,130 --> 00:56:52,197
<i>Ada!</i>

608
00:56:54,599 --> 00:56:56,624
<i>Mother-she fell!</i>

609
00:57:20,892 --> 00:57:23,087
<i>What's the matter, little brother?</i>

610
00:57:23,161 --> 00:57:25,095
Leave me alone.

611
00:57:25,163 --> 00:57:28,496
Mother's gonna be all right.
You'll see.

612
00:57:28,566 --> 00:57:30,625
She can't walk anymore.

613
00:57:30,702 --> 00:57:33,000
She can't even talk.

614
00:57:34,572 --> 00:57:36,506
She's paralyzed.

615
00:57:36,574 --> 00:57:39,566
- <i>Who says?</i>
- Everybody.

616
00:57:39,644 --> 00:57:41,669
You heard the doctor.

617
00:57:41,746 --> 00:57:43,976
<i>What does he know?</i>

618
00:57:44,048 --> 00:57:47,313
She'll get better.
Wait and see.

619
00:57:50,989 --> 00:57:53,321
It was just an accident.

620
00:58:13,611 --> 00:58:15,340
Niles?

621
00:58:16,414 --> 00:58:18,439
<i>Niles!</i>

622
00:58:53,918 --> 00:58:55,909
Are you all right, child?

623
00:58:58,523 --> 00:59:00,457
Yes.

624
00:59:01,793 --> 00:59:03,784
I do not think so.

625
00:59:03,861 --> 00:59:06,329
Tell me.

626
00:59:06,397 --> 00:59:08,592
Tell Ada, please.

627
00:59:10,468 --> 00:59:13,335
I get scared sometimes.

628
00:59:13,404 --> 00:59:15,463
What frightens you?

629
00:59:17,408 --> 00:59:19,399
I don't know.

630
00:59:23,314 --> 00:59:28,217
Sometimes we are frightened of things
we do not know.

631
00:59:28,286 --> 00:59:30,220
But when
we speak of them...

632
00:59:30,288 --> 00:59:33,348
we see there is nothing there
to be afraid of.

633
00:59:35,426 --> 00:59:37,451
He's there.

634
00:59:39,330 --> 00:59:41,389
Who?

635
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:44,768
Holland.

636
00:59:44,836 --> 00:59:47,031
Holland scares me.

637
00:59:54,846 --> 00:59:56,837
Niles.

638
00:59:58,783 --> 01:00:02,241
This is Holland's harmonica,
is it not?

639
01:00:04,622 --> 01:00:07,682
Yes. He said he lost it.

640
01:00:09,761 --> 01:00:12,889
Do you know
where I found it?

641
01:00:12,964 --> 01:00:14,955
No.

642
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:18,568
At Mrs. Rowe's house.

643
01:00:22,173 --> 01:00:24,733
Do you know
how Mrs. Rowe died?

644
01:00:27,378 --> 01:00:29,778
She had a heart attack.

645
01:00:31,082 --> 01:00:34,882
D-Did Holland go to
visit her that day?

646
01:00:34,952 --> 01:00:40,117
He went over, like you said,
and a- and apologized.

647
01:00:41,592 --> 01:00:43,651
And?

648
01:00:43,728 --> 01:00:47,755
And he said Mrs. Rowe
gave him cookies and lemonade.

649
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:51,268
It was an accident. Honest.

650
01:00:51,335 --> 01:00:54,862
He didn't mean to.
It was just a game.

651
01:00:54,939 --> 01:00:56,907
Go on.

652
01:00:56,974 --> 01:00:59,909
He was mad at her
'cause she told on him.

653
01:00:59,977 --> 01:01:04,004
So he played a trick on her
with a rat to scare her.

654
01:01:04,081 --> 01:01:07,881
I told him.
I told him don't.

655
01:01:07,952 --> 01:01:11,319
- He doesn't mean to be bad, but sometimes-
- Stop it!

656
01:01:11,389 --> 01:01:14,722
It's true. It's true.

657
01:01:14,792 --> 01:01:18,023
He's bad, but he doesn't mean to be.

658
01:01:18,095 --> 01:01:21,292
- Honest.
- Enough now.

659
01:01:21,365 --> 01:01:23,697
I shall not hear anymore.

660
01:01:23,768 --> 01:01:25,793
Come.

661
01:01:39,283 --> 01:01:42,980
- Now, child, tell me what you see.
- No, no!

662
01:01:43,054 --> 01:01:45,079
- Look there and tell me.
- No!

663
01:01:45,156 --> 01:01:47,181
No. No.

664
01:01:47,258 --> 01:01:51,058
Very well.
Very well then.

665
01:01:57,502 --> 01:01:59,470
Play the game with me.

666
01:01:59,537 --> 01:02:01,505
Please, child.
Play the game.

667
01:02:01,572 --> 01:02:03,597
I don't want to
play the game. Please!

668
01:02:03,674 --> 01:02:06,336
You must.

669
01:02:06,410 --> 01:02:08,401
Concentrate.

670
01:02:12,083 --> 01:02:14,142
There.

671
01:02:20,992 --> 01:02:24,393
Now tell me,
what is it like?

672
01:02:28,566 --> 01:02:30,625
Cold.

673
01:02:30,701 --> 01:02:32,726
What else?

674
01:02:34,672 --> 01:02:36,697
Dark.

675
01:02:36,774 --> 01:02:39,174
Dark? How?

676
01:02:39,243 --> 01:02:41,336
Dark...

677
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:45,610
l-like the apple cellar.

678
01:02:45,683 --> 01:02:47,878
It's a prison.

679
01:02:47,952 --> 01:02:50,011
I can't get out.

680
01:02:50,087 --> 01:02:53,648
It's locked.
I want to get out, but I can't.

681
01:02:53,724 --> 01:02:55,919
Tell me what you see.

682
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:04,193
I see a box.

683
01:03:06,070 --> 01:03:08,129
Black.

684
01:03:09,507 --> 01:03:11,668
Handles.

685
01:03:14,412 --> 01:03:16,573
The box is wood.

686
01:03:16,647 --> 01:03:19,445
Mahogany. It's-

687
01:03:20,518 --> 01:03:22,679
- It's a-
- Go on!

688
01:03:22,753 --> 01:03:25,415
It's a...

689
01:03:25,489 --> 01:03:27,423
coffin.

690
01:03:27,491 --> 01:03:29,516
Go on. Further.

691
01:03:31,696 --> 01:03:34,358
I see a face.

692
01:03:34,432 --> 01:03:36,457
Whose face?

693
01:03:38,336 --> 01:03:41,669
- I don't want to!
- You shall. You must!

694
01:03:41,739 --> 01:03:45,004
Holland! Holland!

695
01:03:45,076 --> 01:03:47,044
Holland, help me, please!

696
01:03:47,111 --> 01:03:49,136
Say the truth! Now!

697
01:03:49,213 --> 01:03:52,307
Out loud, so we
shall both hear it.

698
01:03:52,383 --> 01:03:54,817
Holland is dead!

699
01:03:54,885 --> 01:03:58,446
Remember?
On his birthday.

700
01:03:58,522 --> 01:04:01,320
He is dead, Niles!

701
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:04,328
Remember?

702
01:04:04,395 --> 01:04:06,727
Remember?

703
01:04:22,713 --> 01:04:25,181
Holland!

704
01:04:26,317 --> 01:04:28,376
Holland! Holland!

705
01:04:28,452 --> 01:04:32,183
Holland! Holland!

706
01:04:37,228 --> 01:04:40,254
Oh. Oh.

707
01:05:29,413 --> 01:05:31,745
Are you all right, child?

708
01:05:33,317 --> 01:05:35,251
<i>Da.</i>

709
01:05:35,319 --> 01:05:37,651
<i>Da.</i>

710
01:05:38,789 --> 01:05:41,451
Oh, child, I am so sorry.

711
01:05:42,693 --> 01:05:45,321
But you <i>had</i> to
see the truth.

712
01:05:46,931 --> 01:05:49,399
It was only a game.

713
01:05:49,467 --> 01:05:51,435
We were playing a game,
you and I...

714
01:05:51,502 --> 01:05:54,403
like all the other games
we play.

715
01:05:54,472 --> 01:05:57,669
Only the time has come
for all the games to stop.

716
01:05:57,742 --> 01:06:00,609
It is wrong, you see?

717
01:06:00,678 --> 01:06:02,669
Dangerous.

718
01:06:04,715 --> 01:06:07,741
Oh, my <i>dushechka.</i>

719
01:06:07,818 --> 01:06:12,585
I could not bear to see you so unhappy,
to watch you all alone...

720
01:06:12,656 --> 01:06:14,954
so I pretended with you.

721
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:18,728
I pretended Holland was alive...

722
01:06:18,796 --> 01:06:21,321
because you wanted it so.

723
01:06:22,733 --> 01:06:27,033
I thought in time
such fantasies would pass...

724
01:06:27,104 --> 01:06:30,471
<i>and you would come</i>
<i>to see the real world.</i>

725
01:06:30,541 --> 01:06:33,874
Have I seen
the real world yet?

726
01:06:35,446 --> 01:06:38,040
Da, dushechka.

727
01:06:38,115 --> 01:06:40,276
I know it now.

728
01:06:41,485 --> 01:06:45,888
Your world is very real...

729
01:06:45,956 --> 01:06:48,186
for you.

730
01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:51,860
Only I could not see.

731
01:06:53,130 --> 01:06:55,189
Perhaps I could,
but I would not see.

732
01:06:55,266 --> 01:06:58,360
It was wrong of me
to want you to play the game.

733
01:06:58,435 --> 01:07:01,461
The wrong was mine
because I taught you.

734
01:07:01,539 --> 01:07:05,566
Oh, God,
I have done this thing. L-

735
01:07:05,643 --> 01:07:07,873
Oh.

736
01:07:07,945 --> 01:07:11,073
I did not know
how far it had gone.

737
01:07:13,117 --> 01:07:15,347
It was only
because I loved you.

738
01:07:15,419 --> 01:07:18,479
Do you still love me?

739
01:07:19,890 --> 01:07:22,552
Child.

740
01:07:22,626 --> 01:07:24,821
I have not loved
your mother...

741
01:07:24,895 --> 01:07:27,625
more than
I have loved you.

742
01:07:27,698 --> 01:07:30,030
There is nothing in my life...

743
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:33,092
I have loved
more than you- nothing.

744
01:07:35,239 --> 01:07:38,936
But everything
is different now.

745
01:07:39,009 --> 01:07:41,068
It is different now.

746
01:07:42,546 --> 01:07:45,572
Nothing can ever
be the same.

747
01:07:45,649 --> 01:07:48,675
Not for any of us.

748
01:07:48,752 --> 01:07:51,482
Everything has gone too far.

749
01:07:51,555 --> 01:07:54,388
It must stop now.

750
01:07:55,492 --> 01:07:57,926
Are you going to
send me away?

751
01:07:59,063 --> 01:08:01,156
Away?

752
01:08:01,232 --> 01:08:04,793
Why?
Where would you go?

753
01:08:05,870 --> 01:08:07,861
Away.

754
01:08:09,974 --> 01:08:11,942
No, <i>dushechka.</i>

755
01:08:12,009 --> 01:08:16,571
You shall never be sent away.

756
01:08:17,681 --> 01:08:20,013
We'll be together always?

757
01:08:20,084 --> 01:08:22,075
<i>Always.</i>

758
01:08:23,854 --> 01:08:26,186
Always!

759
01:08:32,329 --> 01:08:36,129
But no more games. <i>Da?</i>

760
01:08:39,003 --> 01:08:40,994
<i>Da.</i>

761
01:08:42,573 --> 01:08:44,598
Sleep now.

762
01:08:47,244 --> 01:08:49,337
Sleep.

763
01:09:49,673 --> 01:09:51,868
<i>Come on, little brother.</i>

764
01:09:51,942 --> 01:09:55,571
<i>It's all right.</i>
<i>Don't be scared.</i>

765
01:09:55,646 --> 01:09:57,580
<i>Come on.</i>

766
01:09:57,648 --> 01:09:59,741
<i>Come on.</i>

767
01:09:59,817 --> 01:10:02,217
<i>Come on.</i>

768
01:10:23,936 --> 01:10:26,769
Remember?

769
01:10:40,786 --> 01:10:43,778
<i>Go ahead. Open it.</i>

770
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:56,491
<i>Oh, that's sad.</i>

771
01:10:59,939 --> 01:11:02,305
<i>Isn't that sad, little brother?</i>

772
01:11:05,711 --> 01:11:08,805
<i>Talk to him, little brother.</i>

773
01:11:08,881 --> 01:11:10,872
Holland.

774
01:11:15,287 --> 01:11:17,585
<i>Think. Concentrate.</i>

775
01:11:17,656 --> 01:11:19,647
<i>Think hard.</i>

776
01:11:22,128 --> 01:11:24,722
<i>Play the game</i>
<i>the way she taught you.</i>

777
01:11:24,797 --> 01:11:28,426
<i>You're good at the game.</i>
<i>Go ahead and do it.</i>

778
01:11:47,253 --> 01:11:49,414
<i>He has something for you.</i>

779
01:11:50,689 --> 01:11:52,680
Holland.

780
01:11:58,397 --> 01:12:00,661
<i>Hello, little brother.</i>

781
01:12:00,733 --> 01:12:02,860
Hello.

782
01:12:02,935 --> 01:12:04,994
Are you all right?

783
01:12:05,070 --> 01:12:07,038
Yes.

784
01:12:07,106 --> 01:12:09,131
And I have something for you.

785
01:12:09,208 --> 01:12:11,108
You do?

786
01:12:11,177 --> 01:12:13,611
Take it.

787
01:12:15,381 --> 01:12:17,542
<i>Take it.</i>

788
01:12:21,687 --> 01:12:24,679
- It's stuck.
- Take it.

789
01:12:25,991 --> 01:12:29,085
I can't. It won't come.

790
01:12:29,161 --> 01:12:31,721
Your finger's all swollen.

791
01:12:31,797 --> 01:12:34,857
I <i>know,</i> I <i>know.</i>
<i>Take it.</i>

792
01:12:34,934 --> 01:12:37,596
I'd better not.

793
01:12:37,670 --> 01:12:39,695
Ada would get mad.

794
01:12:39,772 --> 01:12:41,831
She said to bury it.

795
01:12:41,907 --> 01:12:43,841
Ada says the ring is cursed.

796
01:12:43,909 --> 01:12:45,843
<i>"Ada says. Ada says."</i>

797
01:12:45,911 --> 01:12:48,311
Take it.

798
01:12:53,686 --> 01:12:56,985
Holland, it won't come off.

799
01:12:57,056 --> 01:12:58,990
It won't.

800
01:12:59,058 --> 01:13:00,992
<i>Hey, wait.</i>

801
01:13:01,060 --> 01:13:05,258
I've got an idea.
Come closer.

802
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:10,691
<i>In the garden by the gate-</i>

803
01:13:10,769 --> 01:13:13,704
<i>You're good at the game.</i>

804
01:13:13,772 --> 01:13:17,230
<i>Go ahead and do it.</i>
<i>Concentrate.</i>

805
01:13:17,309 --> 01:13:19,243
No!

806
01:13:19,311 --> 01:13:21,336
<i>Yes. Do it, little brother.</i>

807
01:13:21,413 --> 01:13:24,576
<i>It's easy. Do it, Niles.</i>

808
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:27,983
<i>Come on. Do it.</i>
<i>Do it now.</i>

809
01:13:28,053 --> 01:13:30,078
<i>Now.</i>

810
01:14:04,356 --> 01:14:06,347
Holland.

811
01:14:07,893 --> 01:14:09,952
Holland.

812
01:14:11,430 --> 01:14:13,421
Hi.

813
01:14:16,835 --> 01:14:19,770
What are you looking
so worried for, little brother?

814
01:14:19,838 --> 01:14:21,965
I thought maybe
you wouldn't come.

815
01:14:22,041 --> 01:14:25,010
<i>Of course</i> I <i>came.</i>
<i>What do you think?</i>

816
01:14:26,145 --> 01:14:28,739
Ada says we can't
play the game anymore.

817
01:14:28,814 --> 01:14:31,783
No more game? Why?

818
01:14:32,952 --> 01:14:34,943
Ada says it's wrong.

819
01:14:35,020 --> 01:14:37,181
<i>"Ada says."</i>

820
01:14:37,256 --> 01:14:40,350
What's wrong with playing
the game, for cripe's sake?

821
01:14:40,426 --> 01:14:42,758
She says it's dangerous.

822
01:14:42,828 --> 01:14:44,762
<i>Dangerous.</i>

823
01:14:44,830 --> 01:14:47,856
Yeah. And I'm
getting scared, Holland.

824
01:14:47,933 --> 01:14:49,867
<i>What are you scared of?</i>

825
01:14:49,935 --> 01:14:52,631
I don't know.
But Ada's right.

826
01:14:52,705 --> 01:14:54,673
Something awful
could happen.

827
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:58,540
We can still play the game.
She doesn't have to know.

828
01:14:58,611 --> 01:15:00,670
We could play it in secret.

829
01:15:00,746 --> 01:15:03,214
- <i>She'll know.</i>
- How?

830
01:15:03,282 --> 01:15:05,250
Ada knows everything.

831
01:15:05,317 --> 01:15:08,286
She can tell what you're
thinking about if she wants.

832
01:15:08,354 --> 01:15:12,381
If she finds out,
it's gonna make her unhappy.

833
01:15:12,458 --> 01:15:15,256
I don't want to
make her cry again.

834
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:18,990
You didn't see her upstairs.
She was crying.

835
01:15:19,064 --> 01:15:21,362
<i>I'm scared for her too,</i>
<i>Holland.</i>

836
01:15:21,433 --> 01:15:23,367
Look, little brother.

837
01:15:23,435 --> 01:15:25,665
Getting scared isn't
gonna do any good.

838
01:15:25,738 --> 01:15:28,605
<i>Besides, if you get scared...</i>

839
01:15:28,674 --> 01:15:31,404
<i>you're not gonna be able</i>
<i>to play the game at all.</i>

840
01:15:31,477 --> 01:15:34,503
And I won't be around then.

841
01:15:34,580 --> 01:15:37,014
Don't say that, Holland.

842
01:15:37,082 --> 01:15:41,018
We can be together.
We can always be together.

843
01:15:41,086 --> 01:15:43,281
But don't say that.

844
01:15:43,355 --> 01:15:47,155
Cripes!
Don't <i>ever</i> say that.

845
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:51,786
No.

846
01:15:52,965 --> 01:15:55,798
Well... sure.

847
01:15:55,868 --> 01:15:57,859
If you want me to.

848
01:15:59,304 --> 01:16:01,397
But don't say that, Holland.

849
01:16:04,543 --> 01:16:10,482
I <i>can't help it.</i>
<i>I'm just scared, that's all.</i>

850
01:16:10,549 --> 01:16:12,779
<i>I'm scared.</i>

851
01:16:12,851 --> 01:16:15,046
<i>I'm really scared.</i>

852
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:18,146
<i>Okay. I'll try,</i>

853
01:16:18,223 --> 01:16:21,124
I <i>will. Honest.</i>

854
01:16:21,193 --> 01:16:23,161
<i>But we better be careful.</i>

855
01:16:44,249 --> 01:16:46,774
<i>They're coming!</i>
<i>They're coming!</i>

856
01:16:50,723 --> 01:16:53,851
Ta-da! Mother of the year.

857
01:16:53,926 --> 01:16:56,759
Hi, Torrie.

858
01:16:56,829 --> 01:16:58,820
<i>Oh!</i>

859
01:16:58,897 --> 01:17:01,764
<i>Let me see the baby.</i>

860
01:17:01,834 --> 01:17:04,735
<i>Oh, isn't she beautiful?</i>

861
01:17:04,803 --> 01:17:07,533
Oh, what a lovely-
Let me hold her.

862
01:17:07,606 --> 01:17:10,336
Oh, she's my dear child.

863
01:17:10,409 --> 01:17:13,105
<i>She'll have</i>
<i>a lot of mothers around here.</i>

864
01:17:13,178 --> 01:17:16,773
Look at that little face.

865
01:17:21,220 --> 01:17:23,984
- Look, look!
- She's smiling! Oh!

866
01:17:30,329 --> 01:17:32,923
<i>She has to eat in an hour.</i>

867
01:17:40,305 --> 01:17:42,296
Mother.

868
01:17:44,610 --> 01:17:46,669
I brought you some lunch.

869
01:17:50,415 --> 01:17:52,508
And after
you have your soup...

870
01:17:52,584 --> 01:17:54,518
I'll read to you.

871
01:17:54,586 --> 01:17:56,679
Won't that be nice?

872
01:18:00,225 --> 01:18:04,389
I had to take <i>Anthony Adverse</i> back.
It was overdue.

873
01:18:07,833 --> 01:18:09,824
I've been working
on the magic show.

874
01:18:12,237 --> 01:18:14,535
I'm trying to make it work.

875
01:18:14,606 --> 01:18:18,167
Ada says it's a puzzle,
but I'll get it.

876
01:18:23,382 --> 01:18:26,044
Oh! The baby's home.

877
01:18:26,118 --> 01:18:29,053
It's a girl, just like I said.

878
01:18:29,121 --> 01:18:31,988
And she's beautiful.

879
01:18:33,425 --> 01:18:35,393
Mother...

880
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:37,394
please don't cry.

881
01:18:37,462 --> 01:18:39,930
I don't like to see you cry.

882
01:18:42,434 --> 01:18:45,892
Everything is going to
be all right.

883
01:18:52,010 --> 01:18:54,171
Once you used to
read to us.

884
01:18:54,246 --> 01:18:56,441
Now it's the other way around.

885
01:19:06,625 --> 01:19:08,820
"Once upon a time"-

886
01:19:08,894 --> 01:19:12,921
Fairy tales always seem
to begin like that, don't they?

887
01:19:15,634 --> 01:19:18,626
"Once upon a time,
there were some elves...

888
01:19:18,704 --> 01:19:21,298
"who happened upon
a cottage in a wood...

889
01:19:21,373 --> 01:19:23,933
"where they spied
a baby in a cradle.

890
01:19:24,009 --> 01:19:27,410
"The mother
was nowhere to be seen.

891
01:19:27,479 --> 01:19:31,006
<i>"And the elves,</i>
<i>being bad and mischievous creatures...</i>

892
01:19:31,083 --> 01:19:34,780
"who loved nothing so much
as doing harm to others...

893
01:19:34,853 --> 01:19:39,085
"stole the child
and left in his place a changeling...

894
01:19:39,157 --> 01:19:42,149
<i>"an ugly creature</i>
<i>of impish countenance...</i>

895
01:19:42,227 --> 01:19:45,492
<i>that no mother</i>
<i>could possibly love."</i>

896
01:21:25,864 --> 01:21:27,798
I'm sorry, boy.

897
01:21:31,169 --> 01:21:33,160
Leno, he's...

898
01:21:36,308 --> 01:21:38,276
It's broke.

899
01:21:38,343 --> 01:21:41,369
Leno fix.
Leno- Leno fix.

900
01:21:41,446 --> 01:21:44,643
Leno fix. It's broke.

901
01:21:47,753 --> 01:21:49,744
Leno fix.

902
01:21:59,998 --> 01:22:02,159
<i>It's broke. Broke.</i>

903
01:22:11,043 --> 01:22:14,308
If the baby cries, just let her.
Don't go spoiling her now.

904
01:22:17,916 --> 01:22:20,851
We'll bring some ice cream
home after the show, Aunt Vee.

905
01:22:20,919 --> 01:22:23,217
<i>Thank you.</i>

906
01:22:23,288 --> 01:22:26,223
Yankees are playing
tonight, and I'm-

907
01:22:26,291 --> 01:22:29,488
- Winnie, you sit up front.
- Oh, thank you, Rider.

908
01:22:29,561 --> 01:22:32,689
Oh, close that door!
The wind is fierce.

909
01:22:37,069 --> 01:22:39,060
Have you seen Niles?

910
01:22:39,137 --> 01:22:41,128
- No. Isn't he in his room?
- No.

911
01:22:52,217 --> 01:22:54,208
Niles!

912
01:23:14,306 --> 01:23:16,240
Niles?

913
01:23:18,343 --> 01:23:21,335
Child, what are you doing down there?

914
01:23:22,914 --> 01:23:24,905
<i>Playing.</i>

915
01:23:26,318 --> 01:23:29,515
Come up, please.
Bring your things.

916
01:23:44,936 --> 01:23:47,700
- <i>Niles.</i>
- Hmm?

917
01:23:50,575 --> 01:23:52,566
Were you playing the game?

918
01:23:52,644 --> 01:23:54,635
No.

919
01:24:13,532 --> 01:24:15,693
Ashford One,
<i>calling Indianapolis ground.</i>

920
01:24:15,767 --> 01:24:17,860
Ashford One
<i>calling Indianapolis ground.</i>

921
01:24:17,936 --> 01:24:19,870
<i>Come in, please.</i>

922
01:24:19,938 --> 01:24:21,872
<i>We're here,</i> Ashford One. <i>Over.</i>

923
01:24:21,940 --> 01:24:26,673
<i>My windscreen's iced over. Going to have to</i>
<i>come in blind. Can you head me?</i>

924
01:24:26,745 --> 01:24:28,679
We can head you, <i>Ashford One.</i>

925
01:24:28,747 --> 01:24:30,681
Is Mary there with you?

926
01:24:30,749 --> 01:24:33,013
Yes, I'm here, Jack.
It's me, Mary.

927
01:24:33,084 --> 01:24:35,018
<i>We're all rooting for you.</i>

928
01:24:35,086 --> 01:24:38,283
<i>That-a-girl, Mary,</i>
<i>Chin up. Buster's here too.</i>

929
01:24:38,490 --> 01:24:40,424
And I'm gonna
put you right down...

930
01:24:40,492 --> 01:24:43,325
and you're gonna
go to sleep, yes, you are.

931
01:24:43,395 --> 01:24:46,421
Wait just a minute.
You'll soon be in your bed.

932
01:24:46,498 --> 01:24:49,399
Yes, sweetheart.
Ooh, what a pretty girl.

933
01:24:49,467 --> 01:24:52,129
Ooh. Ooh, you're so pretty.

934
01:24:52,204 --> 01:24:55,071
You're so pretty.
Yes, you are.

935
01:24:57,142 --> 01:24:59,076
What is that?

936
01:24:59,144 --> 01:25:01,112
What are you doing there?

937
01:25:01,179 --> 01:25:03,477
Go away! Get away,
you crazy old man.

938
01:25:03,548 --> 01:25:05,948
<i>Get away. Get away,</i>
<i>you damn fool!</i>

939
01:25:06,017 --> 01:25:08,076
<i>Get away! Go on! Get out.</i>

940
01:25:16,228 --> 01:25:18,162
- <i>All right.</i>
- What is it?

941
01:25:18,230 --> 01:25:21,961
It was that damned Angelini. He scared me
half to death. Right there at that window.

942
01:25:22,033 --> 01:25:23,967
Oh, honey, shush.

943
01:25:24,035 --> 01:25:26,026
Oh, shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh.

944
01:25:26,104 --> 01:25:28,937
You run along.
I will sit with the baby.

945
01:25:29,007 --> 01:25:31,498
Well, he scared her
half to death too.

946
01:25:31,576 --> 01:25:33,567
<i>Damned idiot.</i>

947
01:25:52,097 --> 01:25:54,224
<i>Thank you, child.</i>

948
01:26:02,674 --> 01:26:06,075
These hands told me
this weather was coming.

949
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:24,294
I will go sit
with your mother.

950
01:26:24,362 --> 01:26:26,626
- Put down the netting, please.
- Okay.

951
01:29:35,420 --> 01:29:37,911
Ada! Ada!

952
01:29:37,989 --> 01:29:39,980
<i>Ada, Ada, Ada!</i>

953
01:29:45,163 --> 01:29:47,097
<i>Anything under there?</i>

954
01:29:47,165 --> 01:29:50,100
Get some light over here.

955
01:29:51,503 --> 01:29:53,528
You see what I mean?

956
01:29:53,605 --> 01:29:56,631
There's Angelini's ladder
right where he left it.

957
01:29:56,708 --> 01:29:59,575
Christ. It's the Lindbergh thing
all over again.

958
01:29:59,644 --> 01:30:02,044
- <i>Fowler. This way.</i>
- George.

959
01:30:03,915 --> 01:30:05,906
Uncle George!

960
01:30:06,918 --> 01:30:08,943
Uncle George!

961
01:30:11,322 --> 01:30:13,313
<i>You there!</i>

962
01:30:13,391 --> 01:30:16,758
<i>No!</i>

963
01:30:16,828 --> 01:30:18,762
<i>More cars comin'.</i>

964
01:30:18,830 --> 01:30:21,128
<i>Where's Charlie</i>
<i>with those other dogs?</i>

965
01:30:21,199 --> 01:30:23,463
<i>There's Charlie's truck now.</i>

966
01:30:24,936 --> 01:30:27,029
<i>It's about time!</i>

967
01:30:36,614 --> 01:30:38,582
<i>Has anybody</i>
<i>found her, Bob?</i>

968
01:30:43,154 --> 01:30:45,281
<i>Nothin'in here.</i>

969
01:30:48,893 --> 01:30:51,384
Child, have you seen Rider?

970
01:30:51,462 --> 01:30:54,226
- <i>Come on!</i>
- Niles?

971
01:30:54,299 --> 01:30:56,426
Oh, go inside, please.

972
01:30:56,501 --> 01:30:58,469
<i>Get up on there.</i>

973
01:30:58,536 --> 01:31:00,401
<i>Let me up the ladder.</i>

974
01:31:00,471 --> 01:31:02,905
Rider! Rider!

975
01:31:02,974 --> 01:31:05,943
<i>The Italian took the kid.</i>
<i>Could be miles away by now.</i>

976
01:31:06,010 --> 01:31:08,035
- Rider!
- Ada?

977
01:31:10,248 --> 01:31:12,341
What's the matter?
What are you doing out here?

978
01:31:12,417 --> 01:31:14,351
Where is Rider?
Torrie needs him.

979
01:31:14,419 --> 01:31:17,217
I think I saw him
down by the pond. Rider!

980
01:31:17,288 --> 01:31:19,313
Rider!

981
01:31:19,390 --> 01:31:22,086
<i>Come on up here.</i>

982
01:31:30,602 --> 01:31:32,536
- <i>Where are ya?</i>
<i>- Here!</i>

983
01:31:32,604 --> 01:31:34,902
<i>Come on!</i>

984
01:31:34,973 --> 01:31:37,498
<i>Rider, Torrie is calling</i>
<i>for you.</i>

985
01:31:37,575 --> 01:31:40,567
The doctor is trying
to get her to sleep.

986
01:31:45,783 --> 01:31:47,478
<i>Niles!</i>

987
01:31:47,552 --> 01:31:51,955
Niles!

988
01:31:57,962 --> 01:31:59,896
<i>Come on! Be careful!</i>

989
01:31:59,964 --> 01:32:02,296
<i>Come on.</i>
<i>Get a move on!</i>

990
01:32:05,603 --> 01:32:07,537
<i>Holland!</i>

991
01:32:07,605 --> 01:32:10,165
<i>Where are you?</i>

992
01:32:10,241 --> 01:32:14,075
<i>Holland, where is the baby?</i>

993
01:32:14,145 --> 01:32:17,410
I <i>know you've got the baby.</i>

994
01:32:17,482 --> 01:32:21,578
<i>Holland. Damn you!</i>
<i>Where are you?</i>

995
01:32:23,388 --> 01:32:25,413
- <i>Holland!</i>
- Niles.

996
01:32:26,658 --> 01:32:28,888
Where is the baby?

997
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:32,418
Holland's got the baby.
He put some pain pills in your tea.

998
01:32:32,497 --> 01:32:34,431
<i>He stole the baby.</i>

999
01:32:34,499 --> 01:32:38,868
He's bad.
He'll never go to heaven.

1000
01:32:40,772 --> 01:32:44,333
Holland killed Russell.
He stuck the pitchfork in the hay.

1001
01:32:44,409 --> 01:32:47,674
He was mad 'cause
Russell saw the ring.

1002
01:32:47,745 --> 01:32:50,009
The ring was mine.

1003
01:32:50,081 --> 01:32:53,312
<i>Holland gave it to me.</i>
<i>He told me to take it.</i>

1004
01:32:53,384 --> 01:32:56,353
<i>He made me do it</i>
<i>with the rose shears.</i>

1005
01:32:56,421 --> 01:32:58,514
<i>Poor Mother.</i>

1006
01:32:58,589 --> 01:33:03,117
But she found it.
Holland pushed her down the stairs.

1007
01:33:03,194 --> 01:33:05,492
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1008
01:33:05,563 --> 01:33:07,724
Oh, God, Niles!

1009
01:33:07,799 --> 01:33:10,768
Holland wanted the ring.
He always did.

1010
01:33:12,070 --> 01:33:15,506
He killed Father.
He pushed the door down on him.

1011
01:33:16,541 --> 01:33:18,532
Holland!

1012
01:33:18,609 --> 01:33:21,134
Holland!
Where is the baby?

1013
01:33:21,212 --> 01:33:23,510
Please, Holland!

1014
01:33:23,581 --> 01:33:25,845
Niles, listen to me.

1015
01:33:25,917 --> 01:33:27,976
Say it now.
Holland is dead!

1016
01:33:28,052 --> 01:33:30,612
- Holland did not take the baby!
- No! No!

1017
01:33:30,688 --> 01:33:32,952
- Niles did it!
- No! No!

1018
01:33:33,024 --> 01:33:34,992
No, no, no!

1019
01:33:41,399 --> 01:33:44,163
<i>Put that</i>
<i>son of a bitch on the truck!</i>

1020
01:33:44,235 --> 01:33:46,863
All right, now.
Goddamn it, talk!

1021
01:33:46,938 --> 01:33:50,066
- <i>Where's the baby?</i>
- <i>We're gonna ask you one more time.</i>

1022
01:33:50,475 --> 01:33:52,136
We got Angelini
over here at the barn!

1023
01:34:01,986 --> 01:34:04,352
Oh, my God.

1024
01:34:04,422 --> 01:34:06,356
- My God.
- George, what is it?

1025
01:34:06,424 --> 01:34:08,949
What is it? What's happ-
George, what is it?

1026
01:34:09,026 --> 01:34:11,153
<i>Oh, my God! No!</i>

1027
01:34:15,399 --> 01:34:17,333
<i>That poor little baby.</i>

1028
01:34:17,401 --> 01:34:19,335
<i>Oh, Jesus.</i>

1029
01:34:19,403 --> 01:34:21,337
<i>That little baby.</i>

1030
01:34:21,405 --> 01:34:24,704
<i>No, no, no, no!</i>

1031
01:34:27,378 --> 01:34:29,642
<i>No, no, no, no.</i>

1032
01:34:29,714 --> 01:34:32,012
<i>Oh, no!</i>

1033
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:37,448
You're gonna
get the chair, you bastard!

1034
01:34:37,522 --> 01:34:39,615
The chair's too good for him!

1035
01:34:41,459 --> 01:34:43,518
<i>Holland!</i>

1036
01:34:45,863 --> 01:34:47,854
<i>Holland.</i>

1037
01:34:50,835 --> 01:34:53,065
Damn you, answer me.

1038
01:34:54,071 --> 01:34:56,869
<i>Holland, please!</i>

1039
01:34:56,941 --> 01:34:59,000
<i>Who are you?</i>

1040
01:35:00,344 --> 01:35:03,802
Me? I'm <i>me.</i>

1041
01:35:03,881 --> 01:35:06,042
Niles Perry.

1042
01:35:07,618 --> 01:35:10,917
<i>Are you?</i>
<i>Are you sure?</i>

1043
01:35:38,416 --> 01:35:41,044
Somebody's up there.

1044
01:35:41,118 --> 01:35:43,245
<i>Who is it?</i>

1045
01:35:43,321 --> 01:35:48,190
I know. I know.
I know who it is.

1046
01:35:48,259 --> 01:35:51,456
It must be.

1047
01:35:51,529 --> 01:35:53,861
It must be.

1048
01:36:57,094 --> 01:36:59,187
<i>No! No!</i>

1049
01:38:55,446 --> 01:38:57,846
<i>Niles, wash up now.</i>

1050
01:38:57,915 --> 01:38:59,906
<i>Time for lunch.</i>
