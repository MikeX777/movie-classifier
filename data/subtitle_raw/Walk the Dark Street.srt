30
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:40,640
i'm sorry to hear it lawton i'm sure as an officer 
your first concern was to look after your men  

31
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,680
i feel badly of course that 
was all the family time he had

32

61
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,840
when he spotted me he came charging

62
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,160
i had one cartridge and no time to reload  

63
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:33,840

66
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:29,760
you see that head over the fireplace? spent three 
months out of bombay safari you know that's always  

67
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:35,760
been one of my ambitions. i've never been lucky 
enough to go on one though. i'll tell you about  

68
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:44,160
a better sport. want a refill? why not? yeah, what 
i wouldn't give for some of your experiences

69
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:57,840
thank you

70
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,480
did you ever want to do something so badly you 
were willing to gamble everything you had for it?  

71
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:17,200
sure i want this to be my best hunt 
where right here the good old usa  

72
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,960
what can you find here that 
you haven't already found?

73
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,840
man

74
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,000
man? that's right what better game 
is there in the whole world than man?

75
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,840
you're gonna stalk and shoot 
a human being? that's right.  

76
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:45,040
you're out of your mind frank that's murder 
not if you don't kill your man but if you  

77
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:53,840
intend to hunt him and shoot him i didn't tend 
to keep him killing him real simple with this

78
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:02,160
30 30. that's right and if you fire this 
the guy's still gonna be alive that's right  

79
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:11,280
because this is a camera gun. camera gun? 
yeah take a look carefully see for yourself

80
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:24,720
blank? no film my own invention instead of 
a real cartridge it's film no sound nothing  

81
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,720
you develop the cartridge and you see 
where you hit your victim and at what time

82
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:39,280
this is what i mean. that's my dog it shows where 
i hit him at eight seconds 31 minutes past two  

83
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,400
i don't get it for a man who's hunted 
big stuff isn't this somewhat tame?  

84
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:54,320
tame isn't the word but i'll have to do 
from now on. my ticker began going on the  

85
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,600
blink about a year ago the doctor told me 
to cut out all strenuous activity especially  

86
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:03,840
hunting. you know what that does to a man like 
me? it's a strangle might as well stop living  

87
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:11,359
but i wouldn't do it for one more hunt it's got 
to be the best hunt the best game in the world

88
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:20,880
hey wait a minute how about you 
and me lawton? in what way? a hunt  

89
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,359
i thought you just said the doc told you not game 
you and me hunting each other with two camera guns  

90
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,200
well i think that's a great idea frank 
but i've got some business to take care of  

91
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,320
oh you mean that store of 
yours? yeah what's left of it

92
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:42,400
how much would it cost to 
straighten it out? about 5 000  

93
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:50,400
okay i'll make it worth your while i love 
to hunt you've got financial problems right?  

94
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,200
right. all right i'll give you ten thousand 
dollars if you fill my kill is it a deal?  

95
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:03,120
well i get the money to match it i was a 
second lieutenant not a chief of staff. all  

96
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:08,080
right i'll give you odds ten to one my ten 
thousand against your thousand. if you win  

97
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,840
you'll have double the money 
you need what do you say?

98
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:22,320
you've got a deal. one shot each the first 
person to film a kill calls the other's name  

99
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:28,240
then we'll develop the cartridge and see 
who forfeits the amount. fine with me. great  

100
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:33,840
maybe my last hunt will be my 
best. where do we start and when?  

101
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:44,640
in the city. let's mark the 
areas so we don't chase all over.

here the first day. here the second. if 
i can't find you in 48 hours i'll quit.

105
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,720

shot or else you lose a thousand. real sporting  

106
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:15,440
game. what if we don't uh what if we don't meet in 
the in the time period? well then we'll meet back
