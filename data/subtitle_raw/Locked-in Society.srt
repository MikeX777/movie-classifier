1
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:25,753
(LOCKED IN SOCIETY)

2
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,277
going to drink that!? You're not

3
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:53,112
Oh, but I am.

4
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,114
A staff room coffee Nothing beats

5
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:58,284
that's sat 6 or 7 hours on the hotplate.

6
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:00,954
Combined with delicious oat milk,

7
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:03,916
this bitumen-like substance

8
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,292
becomes a full-fledged latte.

9
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,086
From a food-chemistry perspective... BERND:

10
00:02:08,087 --> 00:02:11,672
Let him poison himself if he wants to.

11
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:14,008
It's for the nerves. It's not poison,

12
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:16,970
a stack of exams by 5. I have to correct

13
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:18,972
No, I... Do it at home.

14
00:02:18,973 --> 00:02:20,808
Speaking of which, I got to go.

15
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:26,938
Pleasant weekend, adieu and see you.

16
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:29,148
One second. What?

17
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,275
Something to discuss. We have

18
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,443
I beg to differ.

19
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:33,945
I've got to get home, shower, eat,

20
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:35,237
and get to my wife's store.

21
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,073
If I'm not behind the counter by 3:30,

22
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:38,825
it'll be the last Friday of my life,

23
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:41,285
predilection for Fridays.
And that despite my

24
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:44,748
You parked in my space again this morning.

25
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,375
Oh, it's yours?

26
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:51,337
Your own personal parking space?

27
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:54,007
I didn't see a sign. I wasn't aware,

28
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:56,174
Don't act dumb.

29
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:58,052
Don't bother, Klaus. He's not acting.

30
00:02:58,053 --> 00:03:00,471
Particularly from you! That hurt,

31
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:04,642
There are rules at this
high school, Mr. Mertens.

32
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:07,937
Near the entrance has been
mine The parking space

33
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:09,856
since Dr. Clausen retired.

34
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:11,649
Eleven years ago, Mr. Mertens.

35
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,110
Have abided by that. All our colleagues

36
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:15,778
Yeah... Phew...

37
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:17,279
I really like the spot.

38
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,157
The school quick, You get into

39
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:21,659
and more importantly back out again!

40
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,494
So, nice talking to you.

41
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:25,203
Hasta luego, muchachos.

42
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:27,123
You're an oaf! Have a nice weekend.

43
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:29,876
And what's more, I'm off!

44
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:37,425
That was a knock.

45
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:39,469
We all heard it.

46
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,597
Who could it be? Who cares?

47
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:46,308
There's one thing I can't stand,
I hope it's not a student. If

48
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:47,434
it's students at 2:30.

49
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:49,187
Students at 10:30 are no better.

50
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:52,190
On the door since forever:
There's been a notice

51
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:54,567
Students are unwelcome in the staff room.

52
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:57,028
Yet they're a daily occurrence.

53
00:03:57,029 --> 00:03:58,738
This is a school. It's almost like

54
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,032
The staff room is reserved

55
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:04,326
as a place of retreat and preparation.

56
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:08,081
Grubby senior lounge couch.
I don't hunker down on the

57
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:11,125
Maybe you should. To get
closer to your students.

58
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:13,502
That's the last thing I want.

59
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:19,092
There it goes again.

60
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:21,427
Maybe it's just a woodpecker.

61
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:25,224
If we just ignore it, maybe it'll go away.

62
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,893
Or we just open it.

63
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,689
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
Who are you, anyway?

64
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:35,524
Sara Schuster.

65
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:38,360
For Biology and English. Trainee teacher

66
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:41,656
I've already introduced myself.
Trainees come and go.

67
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:45,868
Is the job description. Trainee Teacher

68
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:47,411
They come and go, too.

69
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:50,456
Are you one of those modern
feminists, Miss Schuster?

70
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:53,542
To be addressed correctly. It's Ms., I want

71
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,753
I recently had
a student who wanted me

72
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:57,713
to use her chosen pronoun.

73
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,508
According to "them," I'm now
to refer to her as "they."

74
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:02,551
What the heck?

75
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:05,554
It offers no improvement
in scientific terms.

76
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:08,934
As non-binary chemistry.
There's no such thing

77
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:16,607
But we could still discuss it
among the staff. Providing...

78
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:18,277
"staff" is inclusive.

79
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:21,570
Right?

80
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:28,495
Before the tension kills us all.
Somebody better get that

81
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:31,914
How about our young colleague?

82
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:33,373
Ms. Schreiber?

83
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:34,459
Ms. Schuster!

84
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:36,961
Whatever. Please.

85
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:39,255
Why Ms. Schuster and not you?

86
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:41,548
It's fine. I got it.

87
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:43,425
It's no problem.

88
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:48,014
Male and female trainees begin at
the bottom of the ladder. KLAUS:

89
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:50,057
How's it going to look if Mrs. Lohmann or I

90
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,434
open the door to a student?

91
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:55,022
We're locked in! Come on, Peter.

92
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,525
It's for you, Mr. Engelhardt. Ah!

93
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,986
I don't talk to students at this hour.

94
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:03,904
It's not a student. It's a father.

95
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:06,991
Worse still. What does he want?

96
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:09,035
Tell him I left.

97
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:10,494
He can hear you!

98
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,831
So now he knows.

99
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,209
I'll take care of it. All right,

100
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,669
Yes, I want to speak to him.
Uh, Mr. Engelhardt?

101
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,087
Great, come in. PETER:

102
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,631
Really? PETER: Yes!

103
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,510
May I ask your name?

104
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:29,763
I'm Fabian Prohaska's father. Prohaska.

105
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:33,142
Look, it's Mr. Prohaska, Mr. Engelhardt!

106
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:34,853
Fabian's father!

107
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:39,233
My consultation hour is Wednesday at 10.

108
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,525
But it's urgent!

109
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,694
Everything is always
urgent, urgent, urgent.

110
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:47,031
Climate change is urgent,
or the refugee question.

111
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:49,742
Why do people take their
petty concerns so seriously?

112
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,869
That's quite fair. I don't think HOLGER:

113
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,705
People with concerns need a friendly ear.

114
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:58,458
And if it's urgent, we need to be here.

115
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:01,045
How can we help, Mr. Prohaska?

116
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:04,215
Has something happened,
does Fabian have a problem?

117
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:07,093
Is Fabian's problem. Mr. Engelhardt

118
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:09,220
So I'd like to talk to you, Mr. Engelhardt.

119
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:12,265
Very briefly. In private.

120
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:13,392
Please.

121
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,980
What's your son's name?

122
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,108
Fabian Prohaska. I'm his father.

123
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:23,650
Yes, I know your son.

124
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:26,070
He's a very nice boy.

125
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:28,114
Your colleague doesn't think so. Nonsense.

126
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:31,200
I have neither sympathies, nor antipathies.

127
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:34,536
The only thing that counts for
me is a student's performance.

128
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:37,582
Well... what's the case in point?

129
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:40,459
Had a conversation Mr. Engelhardt

130
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,169
with my son yesterday in which...

131
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:46,048
I explained to your son that,
according to my records,

132
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:47,674
he's looking at a D.

133
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,509
Ah. Precisely.

134
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:52,430
Admissible to the baccalaureate.
One more point and he'd be

135
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:54,056
of one single point. It's a matter

136
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:55,808
Which he could have earned.

137
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:58,770
Knows begging is useless.
Everyone who knows me

138
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:04,566
I'm just trying to convince
you not to spoil his future.

139
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:05,943
Listen, Mr. Prohaska.

140
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:08,321
We have our big conference on Monday.

141
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:10,448
We'll discuss all of our students.

142
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:12,783
I'm sure Fabian will
be given a fair chance.

143
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:16,036
But Mr. Engelhardt would
have to change his opinion.

144
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,288
Which is why I'm here.

145
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:19,081
I don't have an opinion,

146
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:21,792
and they're impartial. I have results,

147
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:23,502
I told your son as much.

148
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,339
In giving students hope I don't believe

149
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,466
where there is none. It's immoral.

150
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:30,801
Has to take the baccalaureate. Not everyone

151
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:32,845
But Fabian needs to.

152
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:36,890
Your son has had over a
decade to prepare for it,

153
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:40,686
is at least 5 years too many.
Which in his case

154
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:43,897
under-performers in the system.
I don't believe in keeping

155
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:46,359
I'd have winnowed him out long ago.

156
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,943
Winnowed out?

157
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,612
His first apprenticeship by now.
Yes, he could've quit

158
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:54,242
Is that how you talk about my son?

159
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:59,413
It's like a cancer diagnosis.

160
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:01,915
It's hard to face at first,

161
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:05,252
but recognition and
acceptance come with time.

162
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:08,297
Sometimes it's the genes, or the character.

163
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:10,217
One has to live with it.

164
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:13,303
Uh...

165
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:16,722
Would you let me by? No.

166
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:19,808
Kindly step away from the door. Uh...

167
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,352
I need to leave.

168
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:23,354
You're staying.

169
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:25,732
You're staying. Sorry?

170
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,775
You're all staying!

171
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:31,820
I'm afraid I have to get
back to my department.

172
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:35,574
There's an experimental
setup simmering away.

173
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,286
You're staying, too! It could explode.

174
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:41,330
I don't even know your son.

175
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:44,041
So? Mr. Engelhardt doesn't, either!

176
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:45,459
What do you hope to achieve?

177
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,920
Won't change my mind. This approach

178
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:50,339
The day is still young. We'll see.

179
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,882
As three minutes ago. Not quite as young

180
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:53,717
Enough. Step aside.

181
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,469
You'd like that, huh? Step aside!

182
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,097
Step aside. No!

183
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,109
Sorry.

184
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,777
You hit me.

185
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,447
Flowing to your brain.
It'll get blood HEIDI:

186
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:17,199
Is this how you deal
with concerned parents?

187
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,077
No, but if it stops them
from hamming things up,

188
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:21,370
I'm fine with it.

189
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:23,873
Argumentum baculinum. It's known as

190
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,177
Sit down.

191
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,388
Sit.

192
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,474
Sit down. Sit. Sit.

193
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:43,101
Move! All of you!

194
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:47,854
Mr. Prohaska, please calm down.

195
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:50,608
Why the gun? This is foolish.

196
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:52,234
Please put it away.

197
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:54,361
Nobody move.

198
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:55,405
Or...

199
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:58,115
I'll have to shoot.

200
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:01,118
Don't worry, Mrs. Lohmann.
It's not a real gun.

201
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:04,121
I've seen them before. It's an airsoft gun.

202
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:05,164
What?

203
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,333
Like the good old BB guns,

204
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:08,793
only better designed.

205
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:19,094
Are you crazy?

206
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,013
That coffee maker was a gift

207
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,764
from our twin school in Toulouse!

208
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:25,559
Couldn't you have shot Mr. Mertens instead?

209
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,855
What do you think you're doing?
Taking hostages?

210
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,525
If need be, yes.

211
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:34,818
As I already mentioned,
Mr. Prohaska, HOLGER:

212
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:37,446
we have our big conference on Monday.

213
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:40,325
To get ahead of ourselves.
So there's no need

214
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:46,372
You're having your conference here.
Right now.

215
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:48,165
Thanks for this.

216
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:51,126
My Fabian will get his point.
At the end of it,

217
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,545
He deserves it!

218
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:54,548
Or else you'll shoot us?

219
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:58,258
That won't get your son the baccalaureate.

220
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,219
I think we can just give him that point.

221
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,845
Right, Mr. Engelhardt?

222
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:06,350
Fabian gets a point and the
rest of us can go home in peace.

223
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:09,895
I'd be happy to oblige. Over my dead body.

224
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,814
If we submit to your
threats, then from Monday on

225
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:15,484
with firearms here every day.
We'll have parents

226
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:18,153
We cannot and shall not
allow that to happen.

227
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:21,739
Of space your son represents
You won't turn the waste

228
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,244
into a good investment
by employing violence.

229
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,037
You're talking about my son like that?

230
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:29,456
My God! Do you know how many times

231
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,791
I've had this pointless discussion?

232
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:35,045
Parents project God-knows-what
onto their genetic vegetables

233
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:37,923
while the rest of us pay the price.

234
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:41,176
What a way to speak about your students!

235
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,554
You're cynical! No.

236
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:45,556
Oh, no. It's honesty.

237
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:48,016
Of congenital non-academics
We funnel millions

238
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,351
into university education,

239
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:51,019
only to clog up the job market

240
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,896
with college-educated non-starters.

241
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:53,980
It's the truth.

242
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:56,108
I think you're going too far,

243
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,026
Mrs. Lohmann.

244
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:02,072
We're not here to decide whether
Fabian is suited for college,

245
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:06,159
but rather if we should give
him one more year to mature.

246
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,079
He's repeated a year twice. Nonsense!

247
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,332
So this is his last chance. Hm!

248
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,627
Is that you don't spoil All I'm asking

249
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:17,379
of taking the baccalaureate.
His last chance

250
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,589
Fine, we'll do that.

251
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:21,675
Fabian will receive the extra point.

252
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:25,639
No further discussion,
you pocket the pistol,

253
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:29,726
we can all... go home happy.

254
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,563
Hmm?

255
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:36,106
What? No.

256
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:39,318
That's not what I want. Then what?

257
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:43,489
To judge him fairly. I want you...

258
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:46,158
You're not giving him due consideration.

259
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,909
He's gifted.

260
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,579
Yes. I'm convinced. Really!

261
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,955
If you ask me, I also think SARA:

262
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:55,000
there are exceptions to the rule.

263
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,543
No one asked you.

264
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:59,588
I have to get back to my department.

265
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:02,007
My experiment will explode... Otherwise,

266
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:05,135
want to call the police.
Come off it! You just

267
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:07,262
The idea never crossed my mind. I promise.

268
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:11,350
And will be right back.
I'll turn off the gas

269
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,185
Enough!

270
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,020
You're having your conference here and now.

271
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:17,356
And how did you imagine that?

272
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:22,486
You all talk about my son. It's simple.

273
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:26,948
You discuss his achievements,
behavior and prospects,

274
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:33,789
before coming to a joint verdict
based on your discussion.

275
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,374
Yeah?

276
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:39,085
Rather than petty-minded
notes in your ridiculous book.

277
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:42,589
Is the basis of fair
assessment, This ridiculous book

278
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,217
nor your pistol can... and neither you

279
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:50,849
This is mob rule.

280
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,726
No.

281
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:55,019
It's self-defense.

282
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:57,437
Because I've had it.

283
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:12,327
I have four children.

284
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,539
What four children means? Do you know

285
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:18,208
Two times twelve,

286
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:20,627
and two times thirteen years of schooling.

287
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:23,046
Not to mention repeated years.

288
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,549
That makes a total

289
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:27,092
of 50 years of school

290
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,595
that my wife and I have gone
through with the children.

291
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:30,763
Quite the balance sheet!

292
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:33,515
Our own school years. Not counting

293
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:36,184
They were presumably negligible.
Fifty years of school!

294
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:41,648
And a sense of inadequacy.
Nothing but worries

295
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:44,526
I'm sick of sitting
opposite people like you

296
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:48,155
and advocating for my children
just so they get a chance.

297
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:52,910
How humiliating it is Have you any idea

298
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:55,245
to spend decades of one's life

299
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:59,125
begging for one point
here or a D-minus there?

300
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,794
From fifth grade on,

301
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:04,421
they'll never make high
school kids are told

302
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:06,506
with this or that attitude!

303
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,259
It's terrorist tactics!

304
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:15,599
But did you never consider
alternative forms of school?

305
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,309
There are many... I know.

306
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:21,104
They're all wonderful
options, at private schools!

307
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,440
The rich take their kids
out of state schools

308
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:25,024
in private ones, and place them

309
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,610
but I'm not rich!

310
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:28,487
The municipal administration. I'm with

311
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:29,697
Condolences.

312
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:36,913
Said to me yesterday? Know what my son

313
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,459
"I won't make it, Papa.

314
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,337
I'm a huge disappointment."

315
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,923
So I'm asking you, Mr. Engelhardt:

316
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:51,677
feel like a failure Should a boy of 19

317
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:54,053
because he's missing one fucking point?

318
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:57,891
I'm not talking about 20
points, but one single point,

319
00:16:57,892 --> 00:17:00,686
which here is the measure of human worth.

320
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:03,146
To your question. I won't respond

321
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,024
I want my son to be happy!

322
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,194
And so you're rushing
headlong into misfortune?

323
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:11,404
That makes no sense, Mr. Prohaska.

324
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:14,033
Please... be reasonable.

325
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:16,994
It's still not too late.

326
00:17:16,995 --> 00:17:19,204
True, but I still need to get home

327
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:20,874
or my wife will be the one to shoot me.

328
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:25,879
You...

329
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:28,965
will now

330
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:31,842
hold your conference.

331
00:17:31,843 --> 00:17:33,927
We like to hold our conferences

332
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:37,222
at the conference table,
in the conference room

333
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,474
not in the staff room.

334
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:47,858
All right, then push three
or four tables together

335
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:50,236
your conference table. and you'll have

336
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,612
Move it!

337
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:53,989
Put them together!

338
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:02,998
What's with you two?

339
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:05,334
Don't you want to help? By no means.

340
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:08,004
Nor do I.

341
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,228
What about you?

342
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,730
You'll oversee our conversation

343
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:29,275
whose opinion you don't like?
And shoot anyone

344
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,529
I don't want to influence you.
I'll leave the room.

345
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,323
Cellphones, though... If I might have your

346
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:39,158
We don't have cellphones.

347
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:42,203
Hand them over! Of course not.

348
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:45,582
He's right. We don't have telephones here.

349
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:48,209
They're with the principal
in the device box.

350
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,711
In the what?

351
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:51,379
The device box.

352
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,340
We hand them in in the
morning You can check.

353
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:56,301
And pick them up before we leave.

354
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:57,803
There's one device box for the students

355
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:59,763
and another for us teachers.

356
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:02,766
With the student government.
We created the project

357
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:06,561
I co-initiated the pilot plan
for a cell-free school...

358
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,981
And what a brilliant idea it was.

359
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:11,817
So none of you has a phone?

360
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:13,276
No.

361
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,361
Honestly.

362
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:17,615
I believe him.

363
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,035
Where does that door lead?

364
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:23,746
The principal's waiting room.

365
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:26,081
Uh-huh.

366
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:27,458
Fantastic.

367
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,716
Very good. Fantastic.

368
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:40,847
We'll proceed like this.

369
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:45,267
The clock on the wall reads 2:50.

370
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:50,605
I'll return at 4:00 for your decision.

371
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,273
You're off your rocker.

372
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,151
That's locked.

373
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:57,488
Don't shout out the window,
I alone will hear you.

374
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:02,159
And... no tricks, all right?

375
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,576
I'll occasionally look in

376
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:06,579
to verify that you're
holding your conference.

377
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,290
Right. 4:00.

378
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,922
Forgive me, I almost forgot.

379
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:18,091
Your names, please.

380
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:20,052
What do you want our names for?

381
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:24,097
You know who you're dealing
with, so it's only fair.

382
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:26,224
You're Mr. Engelhardt.

383
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,935
You? Peter Mertens.

384
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,647
Uh, that's Mrs. Lohmann.

385
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,607
No need to ask. You're legendary.

386
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,359
For my children, too.

387
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,779
That's Mr. Arndt. And
your name, if I may ask?

388
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,032
Vogel. Bernd.

389
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:43,659
Schuster. Schuster.

390
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:47,914
Thank you all.

391
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:52,543
4:00.

392
00:20:59,217 --> 00:21:00,508
What now?

393
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,385
We'll discuss his son.

394
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,554
You can't be serious.

395
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:08,059
Why not? The sooner we're done,
the sooner we're out of here.

396
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:11,394
Such a bad idea. It's not

397
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:14,564
It'll also advance us as a group.

398
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:18,443
Excuse me? "Advance us."
What is this jargon?

399
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:22,739
The communication structure I mean,

400
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,283
at this school may be viewed as fossilized.

401
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,493
Fossilized? How so?

402
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:28,995
It's possible to innovate

403
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:31,372
how performance evaluation is achieved.

404
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:32,749
We had a seminar at college...

405
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,043
a college seminar. Yes, precisely:

406
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:38,046
I don't need a seminar. Spare me,

407
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:39,589
I've been here over 30 years

408
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,507
with performance evaluation.
And never had trouble

409
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:44,552
Please, don't imagine anything.
I simply imagine...

410
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,888
Knowledge is what counts. Know it.

411
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:50,100
Not perceived truth or intuition.

412
00:21:50,101 --> 00:21:53,145
Education doesn't consist of half-knowledge

413
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:55,981
it's about knowledge. or approximation,

414
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:57,232
Understand?

415
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:59,317
We're here to prepare young people,

416
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:02,237
not to entertain them or to raise them,

417
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:05,158
have failed to do so. should their parents

418
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,201
You've got a lot to learn.

419
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:09,869
Knowledge anymore. They don't want

420
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:13,290
They want to be blown away.
Teachers as clowns.

421
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:16,001
But what has education become

422
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:17,877
when I cater my classes to immature,

423
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:20,505
disrespectful children, spoiled,

424
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:22,715
and their violent parents to boot?

425
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:25,177
It's out of the question. Exactly.

426
00:22:25,178 --> 00:22:26,636
I didn't imagine so.

427
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:28,638
Stop with the imagining, damn it!

428
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:31,891
Why am I even discussing this?
How old are you?

429
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:35,520
How old do I need to be to
count as a worthy interlocutor?

430
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:37,730
There's anything to discuss If you think

431
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:41,276
about the young man's
grade, you're mistaken.

432
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:43,486
There's no need.

433
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:46,823
It's open to discussion. Well, I think

434
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:48,283
Why one point too few?

435
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:50,994
Ah. That's what my notebook says.

436
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:52,204
Yeah. Sure,

437
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:55,498
some basis, right? but it must have

438
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:58,126
One could review his performance

439
00:22:58,127 --> 00:22:59,794
and perhaps find there

440
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:02,088
an oral contribution or homework,

441
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:04,132
that might yield for example,

442
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:06,885
Are you insane? the missing point.

443
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:10,638
You think I distribute
grades any which way?

444
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:13,225
Of course not, but... But what?

445
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:16,144
That I can cook the books?

446
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:18,521
I know you and many colleagues do so:

447
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:21,691
make contracts with students,
come to arrangements,

448
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:24,819
and all the rest of it.
Manufacture consensus

449
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,612
That's not what we're here for, Mr. Arndt.

450
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:28,781
And I fulfill it. We have a remit

451
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:29,991
What's your remit?

452
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:31,868
It's not open to question. KLAUS:

453
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:33,536
I didn't mean to question it.

454
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:36,039
I just wanted to
understand why you're here.

455
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,708
You meant to question it
just like everyone else.

456
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:42,379
These eighth-graders A few days ago,

457
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:47,092
in which I asked them questions.
Wanted to debate the order

458
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:50,387
So what? There's nothing to discuss.

459
00:23:50,388 --> 00:23:53,348
"Strict but fair" is my motto.
It's simply done.

460
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:55,141
That's how it is in Latin.

461
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:57,727
Really want to know, My remit, if you

462
00:23:57,728 --> 00:23:59,187
is dictated by the syllabus,

463
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:01,147
and those who can't clear the hurdle

464
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:03,983
find another game to play.
Must, nolens volens,

465
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:07,279
love's labor lost. Klaus, this is

466
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:11,950
The two of us are a dying breed
in a mediocre school system.

467
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:14,451
Excuse me, Mrs. Lohmann,
but that's condescending,

468
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:16,079
not to say insulting.

469
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,747
I don't care.

470
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:21,293
It looks that way from below.
You're arrogant.

471
00:24:21,294 --> 00:24:23,336
I think she's envious.

472
00:24:23,337 --> 00:24:26,339
Mercy me! Why on earth would I be?

473
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:30,635
Because you belong to that
dying breed of teachers.

474
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:32,511
That bothers you at work The only thing

475
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,223
is the presence of students.

476
00:24:35,308 --> 00:24:37,642
And pay you back. They sense it

477
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:40,187
Nobody likes you. At all.

478
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:44,481
But Ms. Schuster here, or Holger,

479
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:47,235
or even Our Chemical Lover
is appreciated by weirdos.

480
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:48,653
Why "even?"

481
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:50,989
how supremely indifferent
I am If only you knew

482
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,240
to whether the students

483
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:55,285
or you or Mr. Vogels like me, honestly!

484
00:24:55,286 --> 00:24:58,371
My name is Vogel, Mrs.
Lohmann, and I find...

485
00:24:58,372 --> 00:25:01,833
to be portrayed as a witch
It can hardly please you

486
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:04,002
in every school magazine.

487
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:06,921
I receive mail from
former students every year

488
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:09,757
and get invited to
weddings and christenings.

489
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:12,469
No wonder. You're probably
the father as often as not.

490
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:16,264
Touché!

491
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:19,309
What's that mean? Nothing.

492
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:22,895
Ignore these frustrated,
elitist power mongers.

493
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:24,563
They know no better because

494
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:27,192
no young person has ever
thrown them... a BBQ!

495
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:30,778
The idea of forcing down dead
mammalian biomass

496
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:33,823
And industrial-quality
ketchup makes me retch.

497
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:36,742
To the tune of vile hip-hip
No doubt it's served

498
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:39,078
or whatever it's called. or hop-hop

499
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:44,001
Who can still sing "The Girl
From Afar" or "Spring Song?"

500
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:47,628
It's Franz Schubert. You, I fear.

501
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:50,299
Real education for God's sake! The canon,

502
00:25:51,509 --> 00:25:54,760
♪ The air is blue The valley green ♪

503
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:58,097
And the primroses bloom ♪ ♪ The May bells

504
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:03,019
♪ And meadow land so colorful ♪

505
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:07,857
♪ Takes on more color By the morn ♪

506
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:13,696
That's our cultural identity!

507
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:15,698
Children should take their lead from that,

508
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:17,700
not from an emaciated blonde

509
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:20,203
which of her little whores deciding on TV

510
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:23,373
but for fashionable rags!
Walks the streets bare

511
00:26:23,374 --> 00:26:25,624
You go too far, far too far!

512
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:27,419
No, let her finish.

513
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:30,629
I think it speaks volumes
about our Mrs. Lohmann.

514
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:33,841
Your amateur psychology. Spare me

515
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:37,095
Feel free to leave. Very funny.

516
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:38,389
Stare out the window.

517
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:41,766
Practice tying your shoelaces.

518
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:45,644
Do anything that won't overly
exert your cognitive capacity.

519
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:49,857
Why am I even talking to a gym teacher?

520
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:52,609
And he calls himself an academic.

521
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,529
You and that loser Prohaska

522
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:57,823
are cut from precisely
the same ragged cloth.

523
00:26:57,824 --> 00:26:59,951
Maybe, but at least we're human.

524
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:02,537
Ah. Here we go again:

525
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:04,830
sentiment triumphing over reason,

526
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:09,085
and the touchy-feely over the intellect.

527
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:12,046
Get anywhere here. Klaus, we won't

528
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:14,757
This is irrelevant. No.

529
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:17,093
Let's get back to the issue.

530
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:20,472
The Chemistry Department will
explode in less than an hour

531
00:27:20,473 --> 00:27:22,014
for what it's worth.

532
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:26,060
The grade, we must hurry,
If we want to discuss

533
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:29,481
otherwise, lengthy and expensive
renovations will ensue.

534
00:27:29,482 --> 00:27:32,691
There will be no discussion. Fine.

535
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:34,360
So what do we do?

536
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:36,779
What you will do. I have no idea

537
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:40,032
a Cox's Orange Pippin here Luckily I have

538
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:43,661
and a penknife and a napkin.

539
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:47,833
Anyone care for a piece?

540
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:52,711
No? Fine.

541
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:55,132
Keeps the doctor away. ""
An apple a day

542
00:27:56,342 --> 00:27:59,760
We should really use the time.

543
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,513
Ms. Schuster is right:

544
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:04,681
This situation is an opportunity, Peter.

545
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:10,355
Please. We can get in touch
with one another and talk.

546
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:14,275
And discuss our way of communication.

547
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:15,485
As well as Fabian.

548
00:28:15,486 --> 00:28:18,112
I think he has a right to a fair hearing.

549
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:22,201
At the certificate conference.
He'll get that on Monday

550
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,994
Come on, Mr. Engelhardt.

551
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:26,412
We're all fallible.

552
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:29,541
Of the students' business.
Maybe, but that's none

553
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:32,709
One mustn't let one's
weakness become a target,

554
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,462
to a loss of authority. as it leads

555
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:36,256
We've had flagrant cases of that.

556
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:41,135
Can we change the subject? What cases?

557
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:43,721
It relates to him. Why should we?

558
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,223
Please.

559
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:50,186
And his personal foibles,
Thanks to Mr. Vogel

560
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:53,439
we have this abstruse ban on cellphones.

561
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,858
We can leave it at that. Right?

562
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:58,110
It's a scandal that not even I,

563
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:00,988
as vice principal, can use my cell phone.

564
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,114
It's unheard of,

565
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:03,782
and if I had my druthers... Klaus!

566
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:06,327
Changes would be made! Klaus!

567
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:07,746
What!?

568
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:09,498
I've got one.

569
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:11,457
Got what?

570
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:14,919
A cell phone. I've got one.

571
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,630
During morning recess. I confiscated it

572
00:29:17,631 --> 00:29:19,674
You've had a cell phone all this time

573
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:20,926
and never mentioned it?

574
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:26,348
I forgot.

575
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:34,189
Give me it.

576
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:48,244
It must be locked, right?

577
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:51,706
May I?

578
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:53,249
Here.

579
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:00,173
It's...

580
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:03,050
four digits.

581
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:04,885
We can guess.

582
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,971
If you mean to crack it that way,

583
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:09,348
how many attempts will you need?

584
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:11,309
I teach Biology and English, not Math.

585
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:14,270
Ten to the fourth combinations.
There are precisely

586
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:18,149
in layman's terms, 10,000. Or, to put it

587
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:22,445
Going from 0000 to 9999.

588
00:30:22,446 --> 00:30:24,614
If you manage 20 combinations a minute,

589
00:30:24,615 --> 00:30:26,116
it'll take you more than...

590
00:30:27,618 --> 00:30:30,161
though probability dictates eight hours,

591
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:32,163
the last combination, it won't be

592
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:33,998
so count on 4 hours.

593
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:37,168
Maybe it's something simple. Have fun.

594
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:40,714
Is a frequently used PIN. I read that 1234

595
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:54,519
No, I'm afraid not.

596
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,397
Or 0000?

597
00:31:00,651 --> 00:31:02,234
This won't work. Nope.

598
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:04,654
It'll go dead after three failed attempts.

599
00:31:04,655 --> 00:31:07,114
Or the Chemistry Department will explode.

600
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:09,492
Any pertinent ideas? KLAUS:

601
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:12,161
Let's derive the PIN using a biographical

602
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:15,748
rather than hermeneutic approach.

603
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:17,124
Translation for the gym teacher:

604
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:19,961
the student's birthday. We could try

605
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:23,964
Whose device is it? Benjamin Mehltau.

606
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:26,801
An unconscionable 12th
grader and lout to boot.

607
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:29,554
We all know him well. My friend Benny.

608
00:31:29,555 --> 00:31:33,641
He was involved in the cell ban,
by the way. Right, Mr. Vogel?

609
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:41,567
Wait. Can I try something?

610
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:44,444
Um... What's the plan?

611
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:50,325
I'll hold you responsible if you damage it.

612
00:31:53,537 --> 00:31:55,329
Oh!

613
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,582
Bam!

614
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:01,086
Hey nonny nonny! Here. Translation for you:

615
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:04,882
How did you do that? Well...

616
00:32:05,758 --> 00:32:07,341
Mehltau is a swine.

617
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:09,677
He's been drawing his dick
all over since 5th grade.

618
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:12,889
An older teacher's skirt. And he looked up

619
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:14,891
So the combination was worth a try.

620
00:32:14,892 --> 00:32:17,476
So what was the code, Sherlock Holmes?

621
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:19,437
6453.

622
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:21,355
Come up with that? How did you

623
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,858
a numerical combination: It's not actually

624
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:25,984
Each digit corresponds to a letter.

625
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:28,571
So what does 6453 spell?

626
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:30,657
M.I.L.F.

627
00:32:31,617 --> 00:32:33,911
Milf! Milf?

628
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:36,913
Does "milf" mean? And what

629
00:32:36,914 --> 00:32:38,414
You don't want to know.

630
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:39,791
It's not applicable to you.

631
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:42,376
But it worked.

632
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:46,046
Just as Emergency Call would have done.

633
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:47,298
You don't need a PIN.

634
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:49,216
Say so at once? Why didn't you

635
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:51,552
on the epic fun? And miss out

636
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:53,721
absolutely unbearable. You are

637
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:55,973
We should call

638
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,811
The relevant police department...

639
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,024
before that man returns.

640
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:08,820
Fine.

641
00:33:08,821 --> 00:33:10,822
Should I call them?

642
00:33:10,823 --> 00:33:12,114
I have seniority.

643
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:14,074
It's incumbent upon me to make the call.

644
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:15,828
The device. Hand me

645
00:33:37,808 --> 00:33:39,976
Police Precinct IV, Florian Beinacker,

646
00:33:39,977 --> 00:33:41,226
what can I do for you?

647
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:43,562
This is Vice Principal Engelhardt

648
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:45,147
from Rudi-Dutschke High.

649
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:47,024
Do you wish to report? What situation

650
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,067
A hostage-taking.

651
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:50,569
Please describe the situation.

652
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:53,490
We're locked in here. It's as follows:

653
00:33:54,825 --> 00:33:56,701
Please state the location if you know it.

654
00:33:56,702 --> 00:33:59,286
Of course I know it. Then speak up.

655
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,747
Don't take that tone with me, young man.

656
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,374
What age are you, anyway?

657
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:04,876
Excuse me?

658
00:34:04,877 --> 00:34:07,044
Ahem. Excuse my colleague.

659
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,337
He's a bit confused.

660
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:09,506
I beg your pardon!

661
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,091
Put it on speaker.

662
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:17,805
And what does this concern? Who's speaking

663
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:19,682
My name is Peter Mertens.

664
00:34:19,683 --> 00:34:23,185
At Rudi-Dutschke High. I'm a senior teacher

665
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:25,187
I'm in the staff room

666
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:28,524
I see: a volatile situation.
With five other teachers.

667
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:31,402
We've been taken hostage. You said it.

668
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:33,863
Is in the next room The hostage-taker

669
00:34:33,864 --> 00:34:36,615
demanding we confer on his son's grades.

670
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:39,578
Were perilous for me as well.
Those conferences

671
00:34:40,662 --> 00:34:41,829
Yeah...

672
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:44,707
please liberate us? C-could you

673
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:46,000
Not from the schoolyard,

674
00:34:46,001 --> 00:34:48,461
might see and shoot you. the hostage-taker

675
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:51,463
Of course.

676
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:52,798
Have you understood?

677
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:55,092
The situation is serious, deadly serious.

678
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,510
And you were?

679
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,554
Vice Principal Engelhardt.

680
00:34:58,555 --> 00:35:02,307
Or you'll be in big trouble!
Follow our instructions

681
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:03,936
I'll be expelled or what?

682
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:06,062
Give me your name,

683
00:35:06,063 --> 00:35:08,647
rank and badge number this instant!

684
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:11,317
I'm the Director of Willy
Wonka's Factory, asshole.

685
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:17,073
Outrageous!

686
00:35:17,074 --> 00:35:19,743
Your authoritarian tone! Always with

687
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:21,912
Let me try. HEIDI:

688
00:35:23,413 --> 00:35:24,456
Right here.

689
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:26,708
No, redial.

690
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:32,797
Police Precinct IV, Florian Beinacker,

691
00:35:32,798 --> 00:35:34,298
what can I do for you?

692
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:36,968
From Rudi-Dutschke High.
This is Heidi Lohmann

693
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:39,344
just spoke to you. My colleague

694
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:41,263
Oh, yeah, I remember!

695
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:45,517
The situation is as described,
please come here at once.

696
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:47,645
Please come quickly,

697
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:49,981
I have an experiment running
in the chemistry room

698
00:35:49,982 --> 00:35:52,775
that could explode at any moment.

699
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:54,234
The Fire Department. Then we'll bring

700
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:56,195
of Engineers, too. and the Corps

701
00:35:57,363 --> 00:35:59,531
The situation is serious.

702
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:01,117
We'll see what we can do.

703
00:36:01,118 --> 00:36:04,579
Are you available for queries
at the indicated number?

704
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,373
Of course. Then remain calm

705
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:09,959
and we'll look into it.

706
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:13,713
Maybe we'll bring along drinks.
You guys sound like fun.

707
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:20,052
Did he just call us "you guys"?

708
00:36:20,053 --> 00:36:21,637
Should I call back?

709
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:23,681
The officer didn't sound interested

710
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:25,557
in resolving our problem.

711
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:29,687
All calls are recorded. No. They'll come.

712
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:31,522
Imagine something happens

713
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:35,067
the police ignored our call.
And it turns out

714
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:39,030
And the police never have those.
It'd be a scandal.

715
00:36:39,031 --> 00:36:42,449
I find your permanently
ironic undertone insulting.

716
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:45,119
For your sandals. The same goes

717
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,038
against my sandals? What do you have

718
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:50,916
They're fantastic and
conducive to good health.

719
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,126
Right!

720
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:53,669
Leave Mr. Vogels in peace

721
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,671
and worry about your own inanities.

722
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:57,339
The name is Vogel.

723
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,924
As you wish.

724
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:00,885
Something in hand We should have

725
00:37:00,886 --> 00:37:03,095
before Mr. Prohaska returns.

726
00:37:03,096 --> 00:37:04,763
Maybe he's right

727
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:07,975
enough effort all these years.
And we haven't given Fabian

728
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:11,896
to hold this discussion.
It could do us credit

729
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:14,481
Without foregone conclusion.

730
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:17,234
Had you been paying attention,

731
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:20,278
conclusion was intended:
you'd know a foregone

732
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:23,699
The man threatened to shoot us
if we don't vote as he wishes.

733
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:26,994
We could at least try it.
Vote? To what end?

734
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:30,915
And it definitely won't be that.
He wants a unanimous decision

735
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:32,917
where we stand. But we'll know

736
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:36,128
of awarding Fabian one point?
So, who's in favor

737
00:37:36,129 --> 00:37:40,257
Do we have to vote publicly?
I'd prefer a secret ballot.

738
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:43,719
The complicated way.
Fine, we'll do it

739
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,722
A slip of paper. Everyone gets

740
00:37:46,723 --> 00:37:49,474
If you want to give the kid
a point, put a dot on it.

741
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:53,063
Then draw a line. If you don't,

742
00:37:54,147 --> 00:37:56,565
Then fold them up,

743
00:37:56,566 --> 00:37:58,234
and I'll collect them.

744
00:37:58,235 --> 00:37:59,568
This is ludicrous.

745
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:01,780
Maybe, but we've got nothing better to do.

746
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,578
Everyone done?

747
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:16,920
Then I'll go around.

748
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:28,305
An election officer, We need to appoint

749
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,390
and two deputies. secretary,

750
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:33,102
Your slip, please. Very funny.

751
00:38:33,103 --> 00:38:35,147
Many thanks. There.

752
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:38,775
Thanks.

753
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:42,028
Holger, you're taking notes? Mm-hm.

754
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:48,243
Line.

755
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:52,872
Two lines. Another line.

756
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,835
Reason prevails. Line.

757
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,046
Mm-hm. Dot.

758
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:04,176
Dot.

759
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:10,056
Yes, sir. Another dot.

760
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:13,558
That makes three votes for Fabian

761
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:14,977
and three against.

762
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:16,979
This woman shouldn't be able to vote.

763
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,439
This woman is a faculty member, Mrs.
Lohmann.

764
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,859
She's a trainee, for God's sake.

765
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,402
What does she know about such things?

766
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:27,656
We'd have reached a majority.
If she hadn't voted,

767
00:39:27,657 --> 00:39:30,284
How do you know how I voted?

768
00:39:30,285 --> 00:39:32,494
Firstly, I don't need a
crystal ball for that.

769
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:35,706
Secondly, I don't care how someone votes

770
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:39,251
who wiggles her ass to
tantalize the seniors.

771
00:39:39,252 --> 00:39:42,796
Thirdly, the vote is null and void anyway.

772
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:44,882
It has to be unanimous.

773
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:47,467
What was that about wiggling? Leave me be.

774
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:49,345
No, that's enough.

775
00:39:49,346 --> 00:39:52,014
Towards Sara is pissing me off.
Your condescending manner

776
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:54,058
She's a trainee, Apologize.

777
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:56,268
He's a gym teacher. I rest my case.

778
00:39:56,269 --> 00:40:00,189
What's wrong
with being a gym teacher?

779
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:02,816
Where should I begin? It
was a rhetorical question.

780
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:05,944
Gym isn't a school subject,
but a leisure activity.

781
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:08,989
One could spend one's
time more meaningfully.

782
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,241
How?

783
00:40:10,242 --> 00:40:12,659
Making garlands with Nazi maidens

784
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,536
and singing your Schubert?

785
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:16,163
He's not my Schubert.

786
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:20,125
A little cultural education And yes,

787
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:24,796
your locker-room-scented life.
Would've improved

788
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:26,882
You might've become a real teacher.

789
00:40:26,883 --> 00:40:28,842
This is getting us nowhere.

790
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:32,054
This isn't about our
antipathies, but about Fabian.

791
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:36,975
We really will be guilty if he fails

792
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:40,938
without our having discussed him.

793
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:42,023
Goodness!

794
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:48,112
It's obvious why Engelhardt and
Lohmann voted against Fabian,

795
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:49,864
but why did you...

796
00:40:51,741 --> 00:40:53,700
Mr. Vogel?

797
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:56,912
It was a secret ballot. How would you know?

798
00:40:56,913 --> 00:40:58,914
Correct.

799
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:01,125
So no one would know As you wished,

800
00:41:01,126 --> 00:41:03,211
against Fabian's future. you voted

801
00:41:04,337 --> 00:41:06,713
I don't have to justify myself to you.

802
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:10,593
But you could at least explain
your decision, couldn't you?

803
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:14,679
I don't know.

804
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,891
If Mr. Engelhardt sees
things the way he does,

805
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,893
who am I to question him?

806
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:22,105
Might be mistaken. Mr. Engelhardt

807
00:41:23,315 --> 00:41:25,523
Actually...

808
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:28,694
I've never known
Mr. Engelhardt to be wrong.

809
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:32,823
So you always share
Mr. Engelhardt's opinion?

810
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:34,908
Why should Mr. Vogels answer that question?

811
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:38,703
His name is Vogel, and he
should answer the question.

812
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:41,498
If you only ever go along
with Mr. Engelhardt,

813
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,875
you have no opinion of your own.

814
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:46,128
Of course I do.

815
00:41:46,129 --> 00:41:47,464
Namely?

816
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:51,968
Whatever it is, I'm not
voting against Mr. Engelhardt.

817
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:56,805
Because Mr. Engelhardt protects you?

818
00:41:56,806 --> 00:41:59,016
What are you insinuating?

819
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:00,600
That porn scandal You know

820
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:02,936
would've cost you your job without him.

821
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,938
Nothing to do with it. That has

822
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:06,940
What has nothing to do with what?

823
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:10,069
Stop. It's irrelevant.
I wasn't found guilty.

824
00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:12,488
Ahem. Our Chemical Lover

825
00:42:12,489 --> 00:42:15,240
circulated pornographic material...

826
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:17,368
That's not true. in his classroom.

827
00:42:17,369 --> 00:42:21,163
He didn't circulate anything.
Strictly speaking,

828
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:22,664
It was like this:

829
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:26,793
a projector to his
laptop Mr. Vogel attached

830
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:30,797
about some chemical reaction.
To show a film

831
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:33,967
It was about redox reactions
converting chemical BERND:

832
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:36,678
into electrical energy,
which is fascinating.

833
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:40,474
But not as fascinating as
what then ensued. PETER:

834
00:42:40,475 --> 00:42:45,103
He set the class assignment and
left the room briefly. HOLGER:

835
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:47,814
A student, our Benny Mehltau,

836
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:49,233
had the glorious idea

837
00:42:49,234 --> 00:42:52,320
of checking Mr. Vogel's browser history.

838
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:57,075
Everyone in the class was able to see

839
00:42:58,076 --> 00:43:00,495
Mr. Vogel's most recent tabs:

840
00:43:02,414 --> 00:43:04,457
several short clips...

841
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,000
That had nothing to do SARA:

842
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:09,294
with fuel cells, I guess.

843
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:12,714
The little shits recorded it
all on their phones PETER:

844
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:15,800
and shared it on Insta.
My favorite title was:

845
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:17,554
School Girls Fisting.

846
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:21,682
School girls fasting? So what?

847
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:26,896
This was nothing involving Lent.
Dear colleague,

848
00:43:27,439 --> 00:43:28,688
No?

849
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:31,691
An embarrassing affair. It was doubtless

850
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:34,069
students should never Like I said,

851
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:36,488
witness teachers' weaknesses.
Stay reserved.

852
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:39,283
I never showed it to anyone.

853
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:41,201
Be that as it may, since then,

854
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:44,246
abstruse cell ban: we've had this

855
00:43:44,247 --> 00:43:47,958
No one is allowed to take photos
or film on school property,

856
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:52,629
a smartphone, phones are banned.
And because everyone owns

857
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,840
Whether that's permissible...
It's in the school ordinance.

858
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:57,384
That's not everything:

859
00:43:57,385 --> 00:44:00,429
disciplinary proceedings.
Mr. Engelhardt blocked

860
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:03,848
I considered disciplinary
proceedings ineffective

861
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:05,517
and advised against them.

862
00:44:05,518 --> 00:44:07,519
They'd only fan the flames.

863
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:11,356
In lockstep with Mr. Engelhardt.
That's why Mr. Vogel is

864
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:14,234
But we're not voting for
or against Mr. Engelhardt,

865
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:16,278
but rather for or against Fabian Prohaska,

866
00:44:16,279 --> 00:44:18,405
if I may remind you, Mr. Vogel.

867
00:44:18,406 --> 00:44:21,033
This has nothing to do with Mr. Engelhardt.

868
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:25,204
It has to do with Mr. Mertens.

869
00:44:26,498 --> 00:44:29,124
Maybe you're only against Fabian Mr. Vogel,

870
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:31,293
against Mr. Mertens? so you can be

871
00:44:31,294 --> 00:44:32,961
Ah.

872
00:44:32,962 --> 00:44:35,130
You and your Mr. Mertens!

873
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:37,007
You dislike him, correct?

874
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:41,178
It's irrelevant who likes whom.
People are all the same to me.

875
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:43,763
Hm. So it's true what they say:

876
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:45,432
that you're an outsider among the staff.

877
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:48,727
I'm an individualist.

878
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:51,480
That explains the sandals.

879
00:44:51,481 --> 00:44:53,566
Leave me in peace. Ooh!

880
00:44:56,194 --> 00:44:58,111
Oh. It's agitated.

881
00:44:58,112 --> 00:45:01,490
Maybe chocolate will calm it down.

882
00:45:01,491 --> 00:45:03,074
Let me be.

883
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:06,954
I just want to be left in peace.
I've never bothered you.

884
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:10,374
Always picks on me. Everyone

885
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:12,501
Mr. Vogel! HOLGER:

886
00:45:12,502 --> 00:45:15,296
"everyone" and "always?"
What do you mean by

887
00:45:16,548 --> 00:45:17,882
What's upsetting you?

888
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:20,467
Would you like to share?

889
00:45:26,057 --> 00:45:28,684
I see the looks you give me,

890
00:45:28,685 --> 00:45:31,562
how you talk about me behind my back:

891
00:45:31,563 --> 00:45:34,606
I wear funny shoes, I have no family,

892
00:45:34,607 --> 00:45:38,026
I always reek of sulfur or whatever...

893
00:45:38,027 --> 00:45:40,362
I know I don't have the assertive voice

894
00:45:40,363 --> 00:45:43,574
or the charm of Mr. Arndt.
Of Mr. Engelhardt

895
00:45:43,575 --> 00:45:46,910
"Our Chemical Lover." I'm always just

896
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:48,786
No one listens to me.

897
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:51,039
Everyone interrupts me At conferences,

898
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,501
like I'm not even there.

899
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:57,337
No one responds to what I say

900
00:45:57,338 --> 00:45:59,964
for my expert opinion. and I'm never asked

901
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:02,967
all just laugh at me. The students

902
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:05,637
in the law of mass action,
No one is interested

903
00:46:05,638 --> 00:46:08,223
yet everyone must know Schubert's songs.

904
00:46:08,224 --> 00:46:11,894
Nobody loves Bronstedt's acid-base theory,

905
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:14,688
but I do.

906
00:46:14,689 --> 00:46:16,732
I love it.

907
00:46:16,733 --> 00:46:17,815
It's...

908
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:20,819
Exciting.

909
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:23,071
But if I admitted that,

910
00:46:23,072 --> 00:46:24,906
I'd suffer Peter Mertens' ridicule.

911
00:46:26,075 --> 00:46:28,244
Among colleagues. It's banter

912
00:46:31,956 --> 00:46:34,124
We aren't colleagues.

913
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:37,628
Mrs. Lohmann has been getting
my name wrong for years.

914
00:46:37,629 --> 00:46:40,255
Periodic table's beautiful
logic I console myself with the

915
00:46:40,256 --> 00:46:42,299
and the two students in each grade

916
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,552
out of polysaccharides. who get a kick

917
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:50,724
And if I do happen to make a splash,

918
00:46:50,725 --> 00:46:52,685
no one wants to know.

919
00:46:54,103 --> 00:46:55,605
What splash?

920
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:59,815
Twice, I've managed to get my students

921
00:46:59,816 --> 00:47:02,736
of Young Scientist of the Year.
Into the final round

922
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:05,615
Twice! In 2019.

923
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:08,701
And in 2016.

924
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:13,122
And you know why no one noticed?

925
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:15,540
You never mentioned it?

926
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:18,627
Mm, no, that's not the reason.

927
00:47:18,628 --> 00:47:20,629
Then tell us.

928
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:23,048
Why don't we know about it?

929
00:47:26,594 --> 00:47:29,888
Forget it. No, please tell us.

930
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:33,475
I put it on the bulletin board.

931
00:47:33,476 --> 00:47:36,645
With the certificate and everything.

932
00:47:36,646 --> 00:47:38,981
It was my success story.

933
00:47:40,525 --> 00:47:44,487
Before going to my department.
I hung it up at 7:40

934
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:48,198
By morning recess,

935
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:51,743
my notice was in the trashcan
under the bulletin board.

936
00:47:51,744 --> 00:47:54,412
Someone had simply removed it.

937
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:56,248
Who would do such a thing? HEIDI:

938
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:08,177
Nonsense!

939
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:11,723
Did you take it down? Is it true?

940
00:48:13,057 --> 00:48:15,433
He was with his lab rats.
How would he know?

941
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:18,353
That's what Mr. Mertens calls
advanced chemistry students:

942
00:48:18,354 --> 00:48:19,855
"lab rats."

943
00:48:19,856 --> 00:48:23,400
how I know who tore down And I can tell you

944
00:48:23,401 --> 00:48:25,318
my laudatory certificate,

945
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:27,821
as it had been replaced by an invitation

946
00:48:27,822 --> 00:48:29,824
volleyball tournament: to a beach

947
00:48:30,575 --> 00:48:32,116
"Starting at 7:00,

948
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:35,454
grilling and chilling
with DJ Pete Mertens."

949
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:39,123
I needed the pins.

950
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:42,460
Sometimes you're such an asshole, Peter.

951
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:45,130
Would apologizing improve things?

952
00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:51,553
I'd ever vote along with you.
You needn't imagine

953
00:48:51,554 --> 00:48:52,638
Never!

954
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:55,390
Okay, Mr. Vogel. HOLGER:

955
00:48:55,391 --> 00:48:57,141
I understand that.

956
00:48:57,142 --> 00:49:00,103
But if you could decide it all by yourself,

957
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:02,355
if no one else had a vote,

958
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:05,316
what would your opinion
on the Prohaska case be?

959
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:11,030
It wouldn't interest anyone.
It does. It interests us.

960
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:14,451
Don't include me. His opinion
interests me not a bit.

961
00:49:14,452 --> 00:49:16,913
Tell us what you think. Mr. Vogel,

962
00:49:22,418 --> 00:49:24,669
I think we're...

963
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:26,380
taking ourselves too seriously.

964
00:49:27,924 --> 00:49:31,217
Won't make any difference at
all This one point in Latin

965
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:32,968
to Fabian Prohaska's life,

966
00:49:32,969 --> 00:49:35,764
regardless of whether we grant it or not.

967
00:49:35,765 --> 00:49:38,684
He'll scarcely remember it in 10 years.

968
00:49:39,769 --> 00:49:41,436
Just as it should be.

969
00:49:41,437 --> 00:49:44,105
He should remember other things:

970
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:45,816
the smell of bread,

971
00:49:45,817 --> 00:49:48,568
the sound of a ripe apple
falling from the tree,

972
00:49:48,569 --> 00:49:50,986
a won game of beach volleyball, even.

973
00:49:50,987 --> 00:49:55,826
If we award him this one
point, he'll go one way.

974
00:49:55,827 --> 00:49:58,954
One point, he'll go another.
And if we refuse him that

975
00:49:58,955 --> 00:50:01,080
So what the hell? He's young

976
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:04,168
as far as I remember. and not stupid

977
00:50:06,002 --> 00:50:08,547
important to any of us?
And is that one point

978
00:50:09,799 --> 00:50:11,967
Not to me.

979
00:50:11,968 --> 00:50:14,218
Nor to Mr. Engelhardt.

980
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:18,222
He's awarded thousands
of points in his life.

981
00:50:18,223 --> 00:50:21,601
If he gives one away, then Lord knows,

982
00:50:21,602 --> 00:50:24,646
he'll have done something
good, for a change.

983
00:50:24,647 --> 00:50:28,023
One point fewer because of it?
Will someone else get

984
00:50:28,024 --> 00:50:29,318
No.

985
00:50:31,027 --> 00:50:35,406
In which I've been making a
deal You see, I teach a subject

986
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:38,159
with the students for years:

987
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,203
the essential elements, They retain

988
00:50:40,204 --> 00:50:43,581
the composition of air,
maybe, the oxyhydrogen test,

989
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:45,040
and, with a little luck,

990
00:50:45,041 --> 00:50:47,084
the basics of the Bohr model of the atom.

991
00:50:47,085 --> 00:50:50,463
In return, they let me
and the three or four

992
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:53,466
preserve our dignity. interested students

993
00:50:56,261 --> 00:50:59,681
For my honest opinion, I'd
say: So if you're asking me

994
00:50:59,682 --> 00:51:03,018
We shouldn't act like gods
with grading superpowers.

995
00:51:03,019 --> 00:51:06,270
In the way of the kids.
And we shouldn't stand

996
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:08,356
Which is why I'm in favor

997
00:51:08,357 --> 00:51:11,776
of giving Fabian Prohaska the point

998
00:51:11,777 --> 00:51:15,698
go his way in peace. and letting him

999
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:26,876
Please,

1000
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:29,712
let's vote on it again.

1001
00:51:30,755 --> 00:51:33,006
By a show of hands. Publicly,

1002
00:51:33,007 --> 00:51:36,052
of giving Fabian a point.
All those in favor

1003
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,185
Peter?

1004
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:47,980
What's this?

1005
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,357
Why have you changed your vote?

1006
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:53,944
For the hell of it.

1007
00:51:53,945 --> 00:51:57,154
It makes no damn difference who votes how.

1008
00:51:57,155 --> 00:52:00,909
It still stands three to three.

1009
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:02,577
Mr. Mertens,

1010
00:52:02,578 --> 00:52:05,121
welcome to the land of reason.

1011
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:13,379
What's up, Beinacker?

1012
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:17,216
Hey, Boss, it's about those
hostage-calls this morning.

1013
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:18,552
Another one came in.

1014
00:52:22,014 --> 00:52:24,682
Today because of that crap. So?
We went out five times

1015
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:27,727
To five different schools.
Five false alerts.

1016
00:52:27,728 --> 00:52:29,729
But this call was different.

1017
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:31,356
How so?

1018
00:52:33,109 --> 00:52:35,568
The other times, there
was only one male voice,

1019
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:37,320
though he pitched it differently.

1020
00:52:37,321 --> 00:52:39,781
This time, there were
at least three voices.

1021
00:52:39,782 --> 00:52:40,825
One was a woman.

1022
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:42,909
Take the word

1023
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:45,411
of an experienced colleague: It's students.

1024
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:48,372
Then his friends want a go.
One of them calls,

1025
00:52:48,373 --> 00:52:51,208
They'll laugh their heads
off if we go out again.

1026
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:55,006
So we're not gonna, got it?

1027
00:52:57,091 --> 00:52:59,718
Something else. But there was

1028
00:53:01,177 --> 00:53:02,553
Get to the point.

1029
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:06,016
The calls this morning,
and the call just now,

1030
00:53:06,017 --> 00:53:07,935
weren't from the same cell.

1031
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:10,980
Give me the number.

1032
00:53:13,482 --> 00:53:16,651
A fucking Saturday to me ♪
♪ Every weekday's RINGTONE:

1033
00:53:16,652 --> 00:53:19,696
I'll speak to the officer.
Where is it, who has it?

1034
00:53:19,697 --> 00:53:21,990
Give me the phone or else...
Are you the boss?

1035
00:53:35,379 --> 00:53:37,213
Nothing. No answer.

1036
00:53:40,134 --> 00:53:41,634
Can we go back to work

1037
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:45,388
and take care of important
stuff, Mr. Beinacker?

1038
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:46,598
Yes, sir!

1039
00:53:47,808 --> 00:53:50,351
You lied to me. No cellphones?

1040
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:51,686
What did you expect?

1041
00:53:51,687 --> 00:53:55,565
Of course. The police. Did you call anyone?

1042
00:53:55,566 --> 00:53:57,400
Half an hour ago.

1043
00:53:57,401 --> 00:53:58,902
The officers will be here any moment.

1044
00:53:58,903 --> 00:54:02,072
You called the police? Indeed.

1045
00:54:02,073 --> 00:54:05,117
And spoke to Police Precinct IV. Indeed.

1046
00:54:07,828 --> 00:54:09,244
That's fine.

1047
00:54:09,245 --> 00:54:11,122
But not for you. Fine for us,

1048
00:54:11,123 --> 00:54:14,792
How can you be so sure? They won't come.

1049
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:16,794
They won't come. Believe me.

1050
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:20,256
Carry on and no more tricks.
You have 20 minutes left.

1051
00:54:28,057 --> 00:54:29,225
Fabulous.

1052
00:54:31,018 --> 00:54:32,394
So, what now?

1053
00:54:34,312 --> 00:54:37,356
We still haven't discussed Fabian at all.

1054
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:41,027
But without the students,
we wouldn't even be here.

1055
00:54:41,028 --> 00:54:45,448
Precisely: Where would we
be without Fabian Prohaska?

1056
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:48,785
We'd all have been home long ago.

1057
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:50,870
You of all people should save us

1058
00:54:50,871 --> 00:54:53,039
sociological lectures. the kitschy

1059
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,665
I preferred you on mute.

1060
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:56,459
When I was on your side.

1061
00:54:56,460 --> 00:55:00,337
And like I said, I'm sick
of everyone picking on me.

1062
00:55:00,338 --> 00:55:01,714
Let's discuss Mertens.

1063
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:04,341
That could get interesting. Huh?

1064
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:07,595
But for no one else. Maybe for you,

1065
00:55:07,596 --> 00:55:09,097
I'd be curious.

1066
00:55:09,098 --> 00:55:12,016
What's there to know about Mr. Mertens?

1067
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:15,186
You'd prefer us not discussing Nothing.

1068
00:55:15,187 --> 00:55:18,606
Why Ms. Trainee is here today?

1069
00:55:18,607 --> 00:55:22,860
On a Friday after school's out.
I'm warning you.

1070
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:25,404
Tell us. I'll tell you nothing.

1071
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:28,533
Why were you still here? Then Ms. Schuster:

1072
00:55:30,244 --> 00:55:32,120
I missed the bus.

1073
00:55:32,121 --> 00:55:34,371
It looked like rain, so I came here

1074
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:37,041
to avoid spending 30
minutes at the bus stop.

1075
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:38,542
There you have it.

1076
00:55:38,543 --> 00:55:40,503
To discussing Prohaska. Let's go back

1077
00:55:40,504 --> 00:55:42,463
You hadn't gone home, either. BERND:

1078
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:45,424
your lamentable part-time
job Before going to

1079
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:47,302
at your wife's cheese shop,

1080
00:55:47,303 --> 00:55:50,097
you had to take care of something urgent.

1081
00:55:51,682 --> 00:55:53,557
This is your last warning.

1082
00:55:53,558 --> 00:55:55,768
I'm afraid of you? You think

1083
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:58,062
I know exactly what's going on.

1084
00:55:58,063 --> 00:56:00,940
With matured Gouda at home Why make do

1085
00:56:00,941 --> 00:56:03,567
when you can enjoy fresh cheese here?

1086
00:56:05,863 --> 00:56:07,280
Peter!

1087
00:56:07,281 --> 00:56:09,907
It's not worth it. Want your ass kicked?

1088
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:11,534
What isn't worth what?

1089
00:56:11,535 --> 00:56:13,828
It's irrelevant now. Let him go.

1090
00:56:13,829 --> 00:56:17,581
Would someone please explain
what the devil's going on?

1091
00:56:17,582 --> 00:56:19,125
Ms. Schreiber?

1092
00:56:19,126 --> 00:56:20,293
The name is Schuster.

1093
00:56:20,294 --> 00:56:22,087
So why were you still here?

1094
00:56:23,881 --> 00:56:26,508
With Mr. Mertens? For a rendezvous

1095
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:29,302
If that's what you call it.

1096
00:56:33,389 --> 00:56:35,808
To having a relationship
So you're admitting

1097
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:37,727
with a married colleague?

1098
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:39,188
That's none of your business.

1099
00:56:41,065 --> 00:56:43,941
You've signaled virtue All this time,

1100
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:46,194
the do-gooder... and played

1101
00:56:48,155 --> 00:56:49,822
While the contrary is true.

1102
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:51,574
Put a sock in it!

1103
00:56:51,575 --> 00:56:53,450
Not to mention you!

1104
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:56,954
To the students every
day, Playing super teacher

1105
00:56:56,955 --> 00:56:59,957
while only having one thing on your mind.

1106
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:02,668
Volleyball and barbecues?

1107
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:06,505
Don't make me laugh! You
are an incompetent fool.

1108
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:10,885
And an adulterer to boot!
A disgrace to us all

1109
00:57:10,886 --> 00:57:12,427
drawing your victims Not to mention

1110
00:57:12,428 --> 00:57:14,680
young colleagues. from defenseless

1111
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:17,017
What makes you think I'm defenseless?

1112
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:20,186
Because.

1113
00:57:20,187 --> 00:57:22,605
Women are a priori victims to you?

1114
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:26,110
Woman might take what she wants?
Have you ever considered a

1115
00:57:27,236 --> 00:57:29,070
So you're a floozy.

1116
00:57:29,071 --> 00:57:31,614
No, I'm a modern woman.

1117
00:57:31,615 --> 00:57:34,409
Ever heard of casual sex, Mrs. Lohmann?

1118
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:36,035
What's that supposed to mean?

1119
00:57:36,036 --> 00:57:38,913
And will get you into trouble.
Mr. Mertens seduced you

1120
00:57:38,914 --> 00:57:40,873
Yes. Me in trouble?

1121
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:43,918
I only do what I please. On the contrary,

1122
00:57:43,919 --> 00:57:46,587
With whom is a matter of some indifference.

1123
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:49,006
What? But...

1124
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:51,175
I thought we were something special.

1125
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:53,344
Come off it, Peter.

1126
00:57:53,345 --> 00:57:56,097
On grubby equipment room
mats You think fooling around

1127
00:57:56,098 --> 00:57:57,723
between dirt and high bar

1128
00:57:57,724 --> 00:57:59,893
of a beautiful relationship?
Was the beginning

1129
00:58:01,937 --> 00:58:05,315
I risked my marriage for you.
And my career.

1130
00:58:05,316 --> 00:58:08,319
That's on you. I sure didn't.
I just like doing married men.

1131
00:58:09,694 --> 00:58:13,115
Personally addressed, Not that I feel

1132
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:15,992
but what's so good about it?

1133
00:58:19,246 --> 00:58:21,080
It's simple:

1134
00:58:21,081 --> 00:58:23,458
They treat you nicer than their wives.

1135
00:58:23,459 --> 00:58:25,251
They make more of an effort in bed.

1136
00:58:25,252 --> 00:58:28,212
They get lost quick to get
back to their families.

1137
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:30,547
They don't bug you on the weekend.

1138
00:58:30,548 --> 00:58:33,843
On stupid little holidays.
They don't want to go

1139
00:58:33,844 --> 00:58:36,220
And they always have bad consciences.

1140
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:38,055
It's fun.

1141
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:40,350
It's all relish and no regret.

1142
00:58:40,351 --> 00:58:41,517
Repulsive.

1143
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:43,812
I wanted to share everything with you.

1144
00:58:44,562 --> 00:58:46,022
All my free periods.

1145
00:58:46,023 --> 00:58:47,773
You two apparently share one brain.

1146
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:49,317
Sara!

1147
00:58:49,318 --> 00:58:51,277
Don't make a scene.

1148
00:58:51,278 --> 00:58:55,948
This is truly a pitiful
performance, Mr. Mertens.

1149
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:57,700
Behold the disappointment.

1150
00:58:57,701 --> 00:59:00,119
He's not used to dealing with real women.

1151
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:01,662
Enough with the innuendo.

1152
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:05,249
It was always the other way
around for the big stud.

1153
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:06,876
Women were your toys,

1154
00:59:06,877 --> 00:59:09,713
inasmuch as schoolgirls
can be called women.

1155
00:59:11,631 --> 00:59:14,008
Affairs with schoolgirls?
Is that true? You had

1156
00:59:14,009 --> 00:59:15,009
Of course not.

1157
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:16,260
Of course he did.

1158
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:18,054
That's why you changed schools.

1159
00:59:18,055 --> 00:59:20,848
It's all slander. Dr. Clausen
told me as much.

1160
00:59:20,849 --> 00:59:23,101
Then tell us the truth, Peter.

1161
00:59:30,734 --> 00:59:32,861
You all know how it is. Fine.

1162
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:37,323
Just admitted it herself. Ms. Schuster

1163
00:59:37,324 --> 00:59:39,783
grab whatever they want. These young things

1164
00:59:39,784 --> 00:59:41,577
if it's a married man They don't care

1165
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:44,247
- they're dealing with.
- Cry me a river.

1166
00:59:44,248 --> 00:59:48,209
You mean to cast yourself as the
victim of what might be minors?

1167
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:50,254
No, they were all 18.

1168
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:53,215
You're so nauseating.

1169
00:59:54,425 --> 00:59:56,051
A most apt epithet.

1170
00:59:59,054 --> 01:00:01,889
Great. That's all I need. Thank you.

1171
01:00:09,565 --> 01:00:12,816
Boss, I know you said to forget
about it, but I couldn't.

1172
01:00:12,817 --> 01:00:14,277
I checked the cell number.

1173
01:00:14,278 --> 01:00:16,487
The phone belongs to a kid It turns out

1174
01:00:16,488 --> 01:00:17,696
called Benjamin Mehltau.

1175
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:19,449
Does he go to school? And where

1176
01:00:19,450 --> 01:00:20,909
Rudi-Dutschke High.

1177
01:00:22,077 --> 01:00:23,578
Beinacker!

1178
01:00:23,579 --> 01:00:25,246
It's Friday afternoon.

1179
01:00:25,247 --> 01:00:29,208
Let alone this "Male-Towel" kid.
No one's still at school,

1180
01:00:29,209 --> 01:00:30,460
If we want to get him,

1181
01:00:30,461 --> 01:00:32,295
straight to his house. we should go

1182
01:00:32,296 --> 01:00:33,754
Mm-hm.

1183
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:38,008
And go to "Mail-Turd's" house.
Get some officers

1184
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:41,804
Really go to town on his ass. Go to town.

1185
01:00:41,805 --> 01:00:44,682
To shit his pants! I want the kid

1186
01:01:00,616 --> 01:01:01,657
Hello.

1187
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:07,497
Heh. Sorry, I didn't quite catch that.

1188
01:01:10,417 --> 01:01:13,503
I'll fetch my husband. One second.

1189
01:01:13,504 --> 01:01:14,795
Harald?

1190
01:01:18,967 --> 01:01:20,009
Can I help you?

1191
01:01:21,970 --> 01:01:24,473
As to remove your helmet,
Maybe you'll be so kind

1192
01:01:28,644 --> 01:01:31,562
Is your son Benjamin home? Right.

1193
01:01:31,563 --> 01:01:34,398
I'll have to ask my wife. I don't know.

1194
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:36,108
One second, please.

1195
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:40,571
You'd like to see Benjamin.

1196
01:01:40,572 --> 01:01:42,698
Yes. Is he in? No.

1197
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:44,700
Where could we find your son?

1198
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:46,661
I can't quite say.

1199
01:01:46,662 --> 01:01:50,665
He and his friends meet at that
skate park beneath the bridge.

1200
01:01:50,666 --> 01:01:53,502
Tell him dinner's at 7:00.
If you do see Benjamin,

1201
01:01:55,379 --> 01:01:56,754
Thanks!

1202
01:02:28,579 --> 01:02:31,330
So now? Time's up.

1203
01:02:31,331 --> 01:02:36,126
Explain to me why Mr. Engelhardt
was wrong in his evaluation.

1204
01:02:36,127 --> 01:02:39,881
Mr. Engelhardt will enter the
point in his little notebook.

1205
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:43,467
Anything to add, Mr. Engelhardt?

1206
01:02:43,468 --> 01:02:44,595
No.

1207
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:49,766
Fine. Anyone else?

1208
01:02:55,647 --> 01:02:57,481
Mm-hm.

1209
01:02:57,482 --> 01:02:59,816
You had over an hour.

1210
01:02:59,817 --> 01:03:02,278
And I imagine

1211
01:03:02,279 --> 01:03:06,365
petty-minded bureaucratic crap.
You wasted it on

1212
01:03:06,366 --> 01:03:09,826
made good use of the last hour.
I, on the other hand,

1213
01:03:09,827 --> 01:03:12,246
By doing what?

1214
01:03:12,247 --> 01:03:14,625
I thought about you all.

1215
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:19,002
And about what possessed
you to punish my son

1216
01:03:19,003 --> 01:03:22,172
for still being a child in so many ways.

1217
01:03:22,173 --> 01:03:24,841
Nobody is accusing your son of that,

1218
01:03:24,842 --> 01:03:26,385
but now you mention it,

1219
01:03:26,386 --> 01:03:28,387
as the "coming-of-age" test.
The baccalaureate is known

1220
01:03:28,388 --> 01:03:31,140
It's supposed to indicate
a certain maturity.

1221
01:03:31,141 --> 01:03:32,808
What my notes indicate That's not

1222
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:34,351
in the case of Prohaska filius.

1223
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:36,979
He doesn't have what it
takes to do a baccalaureate.

1224
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:38,648
You have what it takes to be a teacher?

1225
01:03:38,649 --> 01:03:41,651
Indeed. I've had nigh 40 years' experience.

1226
01:03:41,652 --> 01:03:44,320
Latin was still alive when he began.

1227
01:03:44,321 --> 01:03:47,323
So you could teach us what integrity is,

1228
01:03:47,324 --> 01:03:50,701
you being a splendid
example to the children?

1229
01:03:50,702 --> 01:03:54,413
From saying as much, but...
Modesty prevents me

1230
01:03:54,414 --> 01:03:56,332
yes, absolutely.

1231
01:03:56,333 --> 01:03:57,751
Interesting.

1232
01:04:06,176 --> 01:04:09,094
What are those files? What's that?

1233
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:10,763
Your personnel records.

1234
01:04:10,764 --> 01:04:13,390
Where did you get them? What the hell?

1235
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:15,309
In the principal's filing cabinet. MANFRED:

1236
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:17,019
Now read them to each other.

1237
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:19,855
No one's reading my file.

1238
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:23,984
On examining your files,
one starts to wonder

1239
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:28,238
what gives you the right to judge my son.

1240
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:31,325
Or, as Mr. Engelhardt might have it:

1241
01:04:31,326 --> 01:04:34,453
Ex iniuria ius thing-a-majig.

1242
01:04:34,454 --> 01:04:35,454
You what?

1243
01:04:35,455 --> 01:04:38,582
Ex iniuria ius non oritur.

1244
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:41,084
Right doesn't arise from injustice.

1245
01:04:41,085 --> 01:04:43,170
My opinion remains
unchanged: You're insane.

1246
01:04:43,171 --> 01:04:47,299
I was by no means only referring
to you, Mr. Engelhardt.

1247
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:50,761
Are also morally dubious. Your colleagues

1248
01:04:50,762 --> 01:04:53,430
Sorry, Mr. Prohaska, but
we've already learned

1249
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:55,391
plenty about ourselves today.

1250
01:04:55,392 --> 01:05:00,062
That an extra point for my
son Yet not enough to conclude

1251
01:05:00,063 --> 01:05:03,065
would be the most minor
mistake of your lives.

1252
01:05:03,066 --> 01:05:04,734
I don't doubt it,

1253
01:05:04,735 --> 01:05:08,278
but sadly there was no unanimity.

1254
01:05:08,279 --> 01:05:10,447
It's three to three.

1255
01:05:10,448 --> 01:05:11,533
Wrong!

1256
01:05:12,534 --> 01:05:14,159
I've changed my mind.

1257
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:17,913
Fine, then it's four against two.

1258
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:19,790
In Fabian's favor.

1259
01:05:19,791 --> 01:05:24,169
I said it had to be unanimous. Screw that.

1260
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:27,089
So if you won't read them to each other,

1261
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:30,885
I'll reveal who you're all
dealing with respectively.

1262
01:05:30,886 --> 01:05:32,553
But we know that.

1263
01:05:32,554 --> 01:05:34,347
Not in your case.

1264
01:05:35,306 --> 01:05:36,390
Mr. Arndt.

1265
01:05:36,391 --> 01:05:38,975
You act like everyman's friend,

1266
01:05:38,976 --> 01:05:42,479
but in reality, you send your
colleagues to the slaughter.

1267
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:44,022
What? Come on.

1268
01:05:44,023 --> 01:05:46,150
I'm not listening to this. Arndt, sit.

1269
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:48,985
Would you like to hear Mr. Engelhardt,

1270
01:05:48,986 --> 01:05:51,238
Mr. Arndt made of you? the evaluation

1271
01:05:51,239 --> 01:05:53,156
Not in the least.

1272
01:05:53,157 --> 01:05:56,619
"Engelhardt is a
cold-hearted, petty bourgeois

1273
01:05:56,620 --> 01:06:01,916
students and colleagues alike.
Whose pedantry torments

1274
01:06:01,917 --> 01:06:06,211
His megalomania alone
outstrips his vanity."

1275
01:06:06,212 --> 01:06:09,214
put it better myself.
I couldn't have

1276
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:11,675
You don't come off any better.

1277
01:06:11,676 --> 01:06:13,886
"Peter Mertens is infantile,

1278
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:16,305
and character-wise professionally

1279
01:06:16,306 --> 01:06:18,348
ineligible for promotion.

1280
01:06:18,349 --> 01:06:20,684
He distinguishes himself at parties

1281
01:06:20,685 --> 01:06:23,103
by being overly sociable
to female colleagues.

1282
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:26,231
An embarrassing millstone P.M.
could be termed

1283
01:06:26,232 --> 01:06:27,859
around the school's neck."

1284
01:06:30,027 --> 01:06:31,487
Wow.

1285
01:06:31,488 --> 01:06:32,864
On to Mr. Vogel. MANFRED:

1286
01:06:34,031 --> 01:06:36,575
"Vogel is an opportunist and a square.

1287
01:06:36,576 --> 01:06:39,829
He has a stench, Furthermore,

1288
01:06:39,830 --> 01:06:42,080
and appears unkempt and neglected,

1289
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:44,542
the baccalaureate ceremony." even at

1290
01:06:46,043 --> 01:06:49,004
he got your name right. Hm. At least

1291
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:50,881
"Heidi Lohmann MANFRED:

1292
01:06:50,882 --> 01:06:55,344
thoroughly frustrated governess.
Is the prototype of the

1293
01:06:55,345 --> 01:06:59,431
nor an understanding of youth.
She has neither charm,

1294
01:06:59,432 --> 01:07:02,559
She'll be grudgingly kept until retirement,

1295
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:03,979
and then forgotten."

1296
01:07:09,317 --> 01:07:10,694
Heidi.

1297
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:14,948
Would you care to comment? MANFRED:

1298
01:07:17,534 --> 01:07:19,076
Why did you do it?

1299
01:07:25,375 --> 01:07:27,043
It's hard to explain.

1300
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:30,254
Sorry.

1301
01:07:32,883 --> 01:07:34,383
I apologize.

1302
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:36,052
Why, Holger?

1303
01:07:39,806 --> 01:07:44,184
Everyone expected Mr. Engelhardt
to be appointed principal.

1304
01:07:44,185 --> 01:07:45,811
Then, to everyone's surprise,

1305
01:07:45,812 --> 01:07:48,064
Mr. Eckhoff was brought in from outside.

1306
01:07:50,358 --> 01:07:52,317
He made me an offer.

1307
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:54,737
What kind of offer?

1308
01:07:54,738 --> 01:07:58,657
He said he didn't know the staff,

1309
01:07:58,658 --> 01:08:03,038
and asked me to put
something together for him.

1310
01:08:04,247 --> 01:08:06,456
After Engelhardt's pensioning He said

1311
01:08:06,457 --> 01:08:11,922
plus the... corresponding...
I'd get the deputy post

1312
01:08:14,883 --> 01:08:16,466
his parking space.

1313
01:08:39,074 --> 01:08:40,742
Fuck. Here come the cops.

1314
01:08:43,244 --> 01:08:46,080
Maybe we should dispose
of the doobie, guys.

1315
01:08:46,081 --> 01:08:49,542
That shit is over the top. I guess so.

1316
01:08:54,171 --> 01:08:57,382
Mr. Arndt's dossiers.
Most revealing, MANFRED:

1317
01:08:57,383 --> 01:09:00,636
But the other personal
files aren't bad, either.

1318
01:09:00,637 --> 01:09:02,512
Mr. Mertens... Hm?

1319
01:09:02,513 --> 01:09:04,514
We've already discussed me.
Sorry to disappoint,

1320
01:09:04,515 --> 01:09:05,557
They all know.

1321
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:07,392
You're said to have had

1322
01:09:07,393 --> 01:09:09,771
up to four student lovers at a time.

1323
01:09:10,939 --> 01:09:12,648
You're scum.

1324
01:09:12,649 --> 01:09:14,942
Who's been saying that all along?

1325
01:09:14,943 --> 01:09:17,277
I don't have anything on you. Ms. Schuster,

1326
01:09:17,278 --> 01:09:18,989
You're a clean slate.

1327
01:09:20,490 --> 01:09:22,324
She likes doing married men.

1328
01:09:22,325 --> 01:09:25,285
I'm quite new here. I'm a trainee.

1329
01:09:25,286 --> 01:09:27,246
Then you'll learn a lot today.

1330
01:09:28,706 --> 01:09:30,958
Do you have the impression
You could say that again.

1331
01:09:30,959 --> 01:09:32,960
Pursue the education your colleagues

1332
01:09:32,961 --> 01:09:34,921
of the children? and well-being

1333
01:09:36,464 --> 01:09:38,008
You want an honest answer?

1334
01:09:40,343 --> 01:09:42,469
This school has zero interest No,

1335
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:44,179
in the students attending it.

1336
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:47,724
My dear young colleague. That's nonsense,

1337
01:09:47,725 --> 01:09:49,184
It's not.

1338
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:51,812
Remember last week's big conference?

1339
01:09:51,813 --> 01:09:55,732
We discussed if the school
day should begin at 9:00.

1340
01:09:55,733 --> 01:09:57,693
Has long since established Chronobiology

1341
01:09:57,694 --> 01:10:00,403
improves performance. that a later start

1342
01:10:00,404 --> 01:10:02,906
aren't awake at 8:00. Young people simply

1343
01:10:02,907 --> 01:10:04,533
Their first class is a waste.

1344
01:10:04,534 --> 01:10:06,660
Scientifically proven. This has been

1345
01:10:06,661 --> 01:10:08,370
Proven? How so?

1346
01:10:08,371 --> 01:10:10,664
And always will begin at 8.
School always has,

1347
01:10:10,665 --> 01:10:14,584
That's stood the test of time.
One could simply try it.

1348
01:10:14,585 --> 01:10:16,837
Other schools have been
trying it for a while.

1349
01:10:16,838 --> 01:10:19,048
Only not this one. Why not?

1350
01:10:19,049 --> 01:10:20,632
Ah.

1351
01:10:20,633 --> 01:10:23,343
There were two arguments against it.

1352
01:10:23,344 --> 01:10:25,095
Number one:

1353
01:10:25,096 --> 01:10:28,974
his wife's cheese store on time.
Mr. Mertens here has to be at

1354
01:10:28,975 --> 01:10:31,351
if school ends later. He won't make it

1355
01:10:31,352 --> 01:10:35,230
Family reasons apply to about
thirty other staff members.

1356
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:38,108
All schedules and bus times Number two:

1357
01:10:38,109 --> 01:10:39,985
would have to be adjusted.

1358
01:10:39,986 --> 01:10:41,863
That would mean work.

1359
01:10:44,365 --> 01:10:46,616
Precisely as they did So things went

1360
01:10:46,617 --> 01:10:48,493
over the last hour in this room:

1361
01:10:48,494 --> 01:10:51,372
Everyone against everyone
else and each for his own.

1362
01:10:52,832 --> 01:10:54,332
If you want the truth:

1363
01:10:54,333 --> 01:10:56,168
No one here is interested in your son.

1364
01:10:56,169 --> 01:10:58,461
Mm-hm.

1365
01:10:58,462 --> 01:11:00,423
And you still want to be a teacher?

1366
01:11:01,298 --> 01:11:03,176
Believe it or not, yes.

1367
01:11:04,135 --> 01:11:05,719
To do things differently.

1368
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:10,390
That's so naive, it hurts. Outrageous!

1369
01:11:10,391 --> 01:11:12,809
Is that your students What's outrageous

1370
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:14,770
can only reach you by fax.

1371
01:11:14,771 --> 01:11:16,563
The test of time, too. That's stood

1372
01:11:16,564 --> 01:11:19,482
This school's never heard of digitization.

1373
01:11:19,483 --> 01:11:21,401
Though home schooling is now so topical,

1374
01:11:21,402 --> 01:11:23,612
no one here is interested.

1375
01:11:23,613 --> 01:11:25,822
Is in the secretary's office.
The only router

1376
01:11:25,823 --> 01:11:28,283
one email address. The school has

1377
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:31,494
They shut themselves off, can't be reached,

1378
01:11:31,495 --> 01:11:33,997
There are also budget concerns.
And nay-say innovation.

1379
01:11:33,998 --> 01:11:36,708
You're just praying you retire Come off it.

1380
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:39,753
Before this broken system
collapses around you.

1381
01:11:39,754 --> 01:11:42,380
That's a harsh allegation.

1382
01:11:42,381 --> 01:11:44,633
What if Ms. Schuster's right,

1383
01:11:44,634 --> 01:11:46,927
and you're all just sitting it out

1384
01:11:46,928 --> 01:11:49,138
at the expense of our children?

1385
01:11:49,139 --> 01:11:50,555
Come off it!

1386
01:11:50,556 --> 01:11:53,767
You act like we're to
blame for every E or F.

1387
01:11:53,768 --> 01:11:58,396
You go face a fifth-grade class
full of screaming kids.

1388
01:11:58,397 --> 01:12:01,399
Prepare lessons for 16-year-olds
who tell you to your face

1389
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:03,819
what they can google. they won't learn

1390
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:06,113
who threaten to sue Talk to parents

1391
01:12:06,114 --> 01:12:08,198
if their spawn repeats a year.

1392
01:12:08,199 --> 01:12:09,283
Or worse!

1393
01:12:09,284 --> 01:12:11,367
What do you expect?

1394
01:12:11,368 --> 01:12:13,703
You get three months' vacation yearly.

1395
01:12:13,704 --> 01:12:17,457
In which I attend training
courses, among other things.

1396
01:12:17,458 --> 01:12:19,751
Things aren't that simple, Mr. Prohaska.

1397
01:12:19,752 --> 01:12:23,088
That every single one
of us I can assure you

1398
01:12:23,089 --> 01:12:24,923
has good intentions.

1399
01:12:24,924 --> 01:12:29,053
Maybe you once did. But
nothing remains of them.

1400
01:12:30,138 --> 01:12:31,721
You'll go the way of steam engines

1401
01:12:31,722 --> 01:12:33,473
after the discovery of electricity,

1402
01:12:33,474 --> 01:12:35,768
being washed away by digitization.

1403
01:12:37,228 --> 01:12:41,024
It'll be no loss whatsoever.
And by the looks of it,

1404
01:12:43,318 --> 01:12:46,444
How dare you, you vile wench?

1405
01:12:46,445 --> 01:12:49,865
Wiggle your butt, You come here,

1406
01:12:49,866 --> 01:12:54,286
seduce a married man and imagine
you're a pedagogical authority.

1407
01:12:54,287 --> 01:12:55,412
It's absurd.

1408
01:12:56,289 --> 01:12:58,498
No, it's just time.

1409
01:12:58,499 --> 01:13:01,168
The school has to change
as must its teachers.

1410
01:13:01,169 --> 01:13:05,380
If the school is to be
reformed by people like you,

1411
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:07,382
God help us all.

1412
01:13:07,383 --> 01:13:10,302
What do you like least about Ms. Schuster?

1413
01:13:10,303 --> 01:13:12,846
Or unapologetic opinion? Her butt

1414
01:13:12,847 --> 01:13:16,975
tell me how to do my job.
I won't let some floozy

1415
01:13:16,976 --> 01:13:20,897
Ms. Schuster in the face, too?
Or else you'll punch

1416
01:13:24,692 --> 01:13:26,318
Once.

1417
01:13:26,319 --> 01:13:28,237
It happened once.

1418
01:13:28,238 --> 01:13:29,779
It's all in here.

1419
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:32,866
You will not detail that
in front of everyone.

1420
01:13:32,867 --> 01:13:34,201
Injustice for all.

1421
01:13:34,202 --> 01:13:36,996
Was Paula Sonsbeck. The girl's name

1422
01:13:37,914 --> 01:13:39,581
An insufferable girl,

1423
01:13:39,582 --> 01:13:41,041
a downright harlot.

1424
01:13:41,042 --> 01:13:43,585
And what did she do?

1425
01:13:43,586 --> 01:13:45,462
She made my blood boil.

1426
01:13:46,923 --> 01:13:50,050
That morning, she and her
friends were going upstairs.

1427
01:13:50,051 --> 01:13:53,970
I had homework and my bag, a heavy load.

1428
01:13:53,971 --> 01:13:57,724
And the dizzy-lizzies were cackling away.

1429
01:13:57,725 --> 01:14:01,061
I squeezed by them,

1430
01:14:01,062 --> 01:14:03,188
and she tripped me.

1431
01:14:03,189 --> 01:14:04,481
Seriously?

1432
01:14:06,317 --> 01:14:08,277
At least, she almost did. HEIDI:

1433
01:14:08,278 --> 01:14:12,572
not to loiter there. I told the girls

1434
01:14:12,573 --> 01:14:16,576
They should go to or prepare
for their next class,

1435
01:14:16,577 --> 01:14:19,747
instead of striking
poses like scarlet women.

1436
01:14:20,915 --> 01:14:22,416
Pretty young women SARA:

1437
01:14:22,417 --> 01:14:24,376
prostitutes for you. are automatically

1438
01:14:24,377 --> 01:14:26,128
Yes.

1439
01:14:26,129 --> 01:14:27,462
No.

1440
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:30,048
It's how they talk and dress,

1441
01:14:30,049 --> 01:14:33,343
and lack of decency! their directness

1442
01:14:33,344 --> 01:14:36,305
everything is displayed.
Nothing is a secret,

1443
01:14:36,306 --> 01:14:40,184
The dirt, greed and... Love of life?

1444
01:14:42,519 --> 01:14:44,687
For Shakespeare's
sonnets, One can feel love

1445
01:14:44,688 --> 01:14:46,731
a string quartet or even a little couplet.

1446
01:14:46,732 --> 01:14:49,484
But what young people today rejoice in

1447
01:14:49,485 --> 01:14:51,278
is nothing but base instinct.

1448
01:14:51,279 --> 01:14:53,405
Is all about screwing. Shakespeare

1449
01:14:53,406 --> 01:14:55,031
Even gym teachers know that.

1450
01:14:55,032 --> 01:14:57,575
To cut a long story short, MANFRED:

1451
01:14:57,576 --> 01:15:01,704
and the girls didn't back off.
Mrs. Lohmann started a fight

1452
01:15:01,705 --> 01:15:03,999
The girl offended me deeply.

1453
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,709
Well, you called her a prostitute.

1454
01:15:06,710 --> 01:15:09,504
There were many witnesses. Repeatedly.

1455
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:12,382
A teacher can't start something.
You started it.

1456
01:15:12,383 --> 01:15:15,928
Paula Sonsbeck's insult was in retaliation.

1457
01:15:17,430 --> 01:15:18,931
What did she say?

1458
01:15:20,724 --> 01:15:22,100
I will not repeat it.

1459
01:15:22,101 --> 01:15:26,104
"Unfuckable shrew." Here it says:

1460
01:15:26,105 --> 01:15:29,816
You hit Paula Sonsbeck so
hard, she lost a tooth.

1461
01:15:29,817 --> 01:15:32,486
That'll teach her. Her
parents reported you.

1462
01:15:32,487 --> 01:15:35,530
There was disciplinary action.
Your pay was cut.

1463
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:37,115
Your promotion suspended.

1464
01:15:37,116 --> 01:15:39,284
You had to apologize to the student.

1465
01:15:39,285 --> 01:15:41,536
If you say so. Right?

1466
01:15:41,537 --> 01:15:43,955
You despise youth. All that because

1467
01:15:43,956 --> 01:15:47,709
Maybe you're just envious of the girls?

1468
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:50,212
If you say so, Stasi-Arndt.

1469
01:15:50,213 --> 01:15:53,883
Listen: I don't hate the young.

1470
01:15:55,009 --> 01:15:58,428
I just can't stand them. Hm.

1471
01:15:58,429 --> 01:16:02,057
To make you so hard-hearted?
What on earth happened

1472
01:16:02,058 --> 01:16:06,686
Your softness,
understanding and tenderness:

1473
01:16:06,687 --> 01:16:08,771
They're not worth it.

1474
01:16:08,772 --> 01:16:10,315
You only get disappointed.

1475
01:16:10,316 --> 01:16:13,902
You're better off without
that romance nonsense.

1476
01:16:13,903 --> 01:16:16,780
Then you don't get hurt. So you were hurt?

1477
01:16:18,366 --> 01:16:20,325
None of your business. Like I said:

1478
01:16:20,326 --> 01:16:21,743
That's true. SARA:

1479
01:16:21,744 --> 01:16:24,913
But maybe others, or at least we,

1480
01:16:24,914 --> 01:16:29,042
would treat you differently
if we knew you have a heart

1481
01:16:29,043 --> 01:16:31,211
that beats for someone or something.

1482
01:16:35,966 --> 01:16:37,967
Georges Moustaki.

1483
01:16:37,968 --> 01:16:39,428
Hm?

1484
01:16:39,429 --> 01:16:40,763
Sorry?

1485
01:16:42,265 --> 01:16:45,892
Georges Moustaki, the greatest
chansonnier of all times

1486
01:16:45,893 --> 01:16:49,480
with the most beautiful
lyrics, for Edith Piaf, too.

1487
01:16:50,814 --> 01:16:53,484
I admired him as a young woman.

1488
01:16:54,818 --> 01:16:57,571
From high school in 1976, After I graduated

1489
01:16:57,572 --> 01:16:59,030
I even followed his tour

1490
01:16:59,031 --> 01:17:01,784
through half of Spain and all of Portugal.

1491
01:17:04,495 --> 01:17:05,955
♪ No ♪

1492
01:17:06,872 --> 01:17:08,999
♪ I am never alone ♪

1493
01:17:11,043 --> 01:17:12,420
♪ With ♪

1494
01:17:13,837 --> 01:17:15,423
♪ My solitude ♪

1495
01:17:17,883 --> 01:17:20,469
Once I was very close to him.

1496
01:17:20,470 --> 01:17:21,971
In Lisbon.

1497
01:17:23,389 --> 01:17:26,349
And again. I loved him.
I had to see him again

1498
01:17:26,350 --> 01:17:27,725
I still do.

1499
01:17:34,442 --> 01:17:36,234
I waited behind the venue.

1500
01:17:36,235 --> 01:17:37,987
Monsieur Moustaki! YOUNG HEIDI:

1501
01:17:41,324 --> 01:17:45,452
in my homemade jeans skirt...
And I stood there

1502
01:17:45,453 --> 01:17:47,287
and sassy jacket. Evening.

1503
01:17:47,288 --> 01:17:49,957
I'm a great admirer of your art.

1504
01:17:51,125 --> 01:17:52,709
Thanks very much.

1505
01:17:56,589 --> 01:17:58,423
Very pretty.

1506
01:17:58,424 --> 01:17:59,634
Pleasant evening.

1507
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:10,186
Ooh-la-la.

1508
01:18:15,191 --> 01:18:19,403
Then there was this little slut,
her tits almost tumbling out.

1509
01:18:21,238 --> 01:18:24,157
That hurt you. I understand

1510
01:18:24,158 --> 01:18:26,075
But that happens to many girls

1511
01:18:26,076 --> 01:18:27,994
who fall in love with a pop star.

1512
01:18:27,995 --> 01:18:29,245
It passes.

1513
01:18:29,246 --> 01:18:30,455
Yeah...

1514
01:18:30,456 --> 01:18:32,375
Superficial crushes may pass,

1515
01:18:33,959 --> 01:18:39,130
and everyone is interchangeable.
When there's no foundation

1516
01:18:39,131 --> 01:18:42,050
with Moustaki within me. But I had a future

1517
01:18:42,051 --> 01:18:45,053
I lived for the man. I lived with him.

1518
01:18:45,054 --> 01:18:47,640
I had children with him, a family.

1519
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:52,019
You're crackers, Mrs. Lohmann.

1520
01:19:10,246 --> 01:19:11,830
Well, Mr. Mehltau,

1521
01:19:13,332 --> 01:19:15,500
let's get to it:

1522
01:19:15,501 --> 01:19:17,252
Why the hell did you do it?

1523
01:19:17,253 --> 01:19:19,962
Don't you know it's punishable?

1524
01:19:19,963 --> 01:19:22,465
It was a herbal cigarette.

1525
01:19:22,466 --> 01:19:23,883
No biggie.

1526
01:19:23,884 --> 01:19:25,343
Show me your phone.

1527
01:19:25,344 --> 01:19:27,136
I don't have it on me.

1528
01:19:27,137 --> 01:19:28,388
Are you shitting me?

1529
01:19:28,389 --> 01:19:31,600
I don't have my cell on me. No.

1530
01:19:31,601 --> 01:19:34,143
By whom? It was confiscated.

1531
01:19:34,144 --> 01:19:36,646
Who's Mrs. Lohmann? Mrs. Lohmann.

1532
01:19:36,647 --> 01:19:41,150
A teacher? At my school?
Rudi-Dutschke High?

1533
01:19:41,151 --> 01:19:43,487
During morning recess. She took it from me

1534
01:19:44,697 --> 01:19:46,740
You made no calls from it this afternoon?

1535
01:19:46,741 --> 01:19:48,408
How?

1536
01:19:48,409 --> 01:19:49,909
Mrs. Lohmann has my cell.

1537
01:20:06,176 --> 01:20:07,843
What the hell are you doing?

1538
01:20:07,844 --> 01:20:09,971
What does it look like? I'm having a smoke.

1539
01:20:09,972 --> 01:20:13,349
The smoking gym teacher. How fitting.

1540
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:15,017
Athletes are people who smoke and drink

1541
01:20:15,018 --> 01:20:16,603
And still perform without a kink

1542
01:20:16,604 --> 01:20:18,438
Sit back down.

1543
01:20:18,439 --> 01:20:21,190
Shoot me if you must,
but I need a cigarette.

1544
01:20:21,191 --> 01:20:22,525
Where's my damn lighter?

1545
01:20:22,526 --> 01:20:24,986
Smoking is prohibited
throughout the building.

1546
01:20:24,987 --> 01:20:26,947
Our Chemical Lover is back.

1547
01:20:30,033 --> 01:20:32,368
Call me Our Chemical Lover again.

1548
01:20:32,369 --> 01:20:36,582
Mr. Prohaska, tell Our Chemical
Lover not to wet himself.

1549
01:20:48,385 --> 01:20:51,638
If you start a fire
here, I'll extinguish it.

1550
01:20:54,684 --> 01:20:56,059
I'm warning you.

1551
01:20:57,853 --> 01:21:00,230
Oh, yeah, Chemical Lover?

1552
01:21:02,566 --> 01:21:03,651
Really?

1553
01:21:28,759 --> 01:21:30,593
Pity, I was hopeful.

1554
01:21:30,594 --> 01:21:32,179
Same here.

1555
01:21:34,390 --> 01:21:36,475
Can we finish up? MANFRED:

1556
01:21:39,729 --> 01:21:41,730
There's only one left.

1557
01:21:41,731 --> 01:21:43,399
Mr. Infallible.

1558
01:21:44,650 --> 01:21:46,068
Propriety personified.

1559
01:21:47,695 --> 01:21:50,071
Go on, play your trump,

1560
01:21:50,072 --> 01:21:53,575
so your little mind can find some peace.

1561
01:21:53,576 --> 01:21:55,077
Let me summarize.

1562
01:21:56,245 --> 01:21:59,163
Class 10a wants to take a trip to Rome

1563
01:21:59,164 --> 01:22:02,083
of the Latin language. to the roots

1564
01:22:02,084 --> 01:22:06,838
Homeroom Teacher Engelhardt
creates a varied schedule,

1565
01:22:06,839 --> 01:22:09,465
and finds a hotel and a bus company.

1566
01:22:09,466 --> 01:22:15,430
And divides them by 28 students.
He then calculates the costs

1567
01:22:15,431 --> 01:22:20,268
This makes for a contribution
of 410 euros per participant,

1568
01:22:20,269 --> 01:22:22,937
including travel, hotel, and admission fees

1569
01:22:22,938 --> 01:22:26,065
for museums and educational institutions.

1570
01:22:26,066 --> 01:22:27,609
So?

1571
01:22:27,610 --> 01:22:29,861
But that's not the real price.

1572
01:22:29,862 --> 01:22:32,238
In fact, the bus operator

1573
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:36,785
had bribed Mr. Engelhardt
to get the contract.

1574
01:22:36,786 --> 01:22:39,036
The hotel price was wrong, too.

1575
01:22:39,037 --> 01:22:41,497
A discount for years, It had given him

1576
01:22:41,498 --> 01:22:45,126
pass along to his students.
Which Engelhardt didn't

1577
01:22:45,127 --> 01:22:47,169
And he also hid the fact

1578
01:22:47,170 --> 01:22:51,215
that he charged his students
for individual tickets,

1579
01:22:51,216 --> 01:22:53,217
but ordered group ones.

1580
01:22:53,218 --> 01:22:59,766
Every student 410 euros in cash
So he collects from each and

1581
01:22:59,767 --> 01:23:02,059
though the actual price per person

1582
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:05,605
Mr. Engelhardt? was how much,

1583
01:23:05,606 --> 01:23:07,398
Hm?

1584
01:23:07,399 --> 01:23:09,024
295 euros.

1585
01:23:09,025 --> 01:23:14,948
Ah. So each student is paying
you 115 euros too much.

1586
01:23:14,949 --> 01:23:18,075
With a class of 28, that makes...

1587
01:23:18,076 --> 01:23:21,496
Well? Say it, it's all in there.

1588
01:23:21,497 --> 01:23:23,414
It is.

1589
01:23:23,415 --> 01:23:25,374
3220 euros.

1590
01:23:25,375 --> 01:23:30,005
Not bad, old lad. And who
knows how often you did it?

1591
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:37,011
I did it once.

1592
01:23:37,012 --> 01:23:39,013
Her gall bladder operation. My wife had

1593
01:23:39,014 --> 01:23:41,015
a year abroad in London. My son was doing

1594
01:23:41,016 --> 01:23:42,433
The car was broken.

1595
01:23:42,434 --> 01:23:45,227
Do you know what it costs to feed a family?

1596
01:23:45,228 --> 01:23:47,313
Yes, I do.

1597
01:23:47,314 --> 01:23:49,191
I still don't steal.

1598
01:23:51,694 --> 01:23:53,695
It all blew up in your face

1599
01:23:53,696 --> 01:23:58,616
noticed the group-ticket trick.
Because two smart-asses

1600
01:23:58,617 --> 01:24:00,743
They confronted you,

1601
01:24:00,744 --> 01:24:06,458
and you threatened to
discipline them with bad grades.

1602
01:24:09,545 --> 01:24:11,671
Klaus.

1603
01:24:11,672 --> 01:24:13,172
Is this really true?

1604
01:24:13,173 --> 01:24:16,676
First you steal from
children and their parents,

1605
01:24:16,677 --> 01:24:20,430
to wiggle out of the affair?
Then you use such means

1606
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:23,057
Klaus!

1607
01:24:23,058 --> 01:24:24,559
I paid it all back

1608
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:27,478
and never became principal because of it.

1609
01:24:27,479 --> 01:24:29,063
What more do you want?

1610
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:31,691
For years, you've acted the role model

1611
01:24:31,692 --> 01:24:33,735
and worn a halo of infallibility

1612
01:24:33,736 --> 01:24:36,988
after committing such a lapse?
Klaus, I don't understand.

1613
01:24:36,989 --> 01:24:42,451
How can you hit a girl for being
joyful, carefree, and pretty?

1614
01:24:42,452 --> 01:24:43,954
Let me recap:

1615
01:24:45,455 --> 01:24:47,331
A brawler,

1616
01:24:47,332 --> 01:24:48,792
a snitch,

1617
01:24:50,002 --> 01:24:52,294
a pornographer, an adulterer,

1618
01:24:52,295 --> 01:24:53,755
and a con man

1619
01:24:53,756 --> 01:24:55,840
are to decide

1620
01:24:55,841 --> 01:25:00,012
if my son is or is not entitled
to one single additional point.

1621
01:25:03,473 --> 01:25:04,975
You think that's fair?

1622
01:25:07,185 --> 01:25:10,480
It seems a justice gap has emerged.

1623
01:25:11,815 --> 01:25:14,025
I'm appealing to you again, Mr. Engelhardt.

1624
01:25:14,026 --> 01:25:17,361
Under the circumstances,

1625
01:25:17,362 --> 01:25:19,823
and because none of us are flawless,

1626
01:25:20,783 --> 01:25:23,284
how about that point?

1627
01:25:23,285 --> 01:25:24,911
Kiss my ass.

1628
01:25:24,912 --> 01:25:28,248
Mr. Prohaska said it himself. Klaus!

1629
01:25:29,165 --> 01:25:32,334
Ex iniuria ius non oritur.

1630
01:25:32,335 --> 01:25:34,587
Right does not arise from injustice.

1631
01:25:34,588 --> 01:25:37,381
He meant that because of our wrongdoing,

1632
01:25:37,382 --> 01:25:39,842
to pass judgment on his son.
We have no right

1633
01:25:39,843 --> 01:25:42,428
But it's a double-edged sword:

1634
01:25:42,429 --> 01:25:44,388
Our having been taken hostage is wrong,

1635
01:25:44,389 --> 01:25:46,474
and no putative right may arise from it.

1636
01:25:46,475 --> 01:25:49,310
Then one injustice must outweigh the other.

1637
01:25:49,311 --> 01:25:51,980
Our failings have nothing
to do with our grading.

1638
01:25:51,981 --> 01:25:53,522
Our having been taken hostage,

1639
01:25:53,523 --> 01:25:55,232
is a direct result of it. however,

1640
01:25:55,233 --> 01:25:56,943
So it's the greater wrong.

1641
01:25:56,944 --> 01:25:59,236
Stop twisting things, you asshole!

1642
01:25:59,237 --> 01:26:02,323
My son is getting that point now.

1643
01:26:02,324 --> 01:26:06,078
When the school explodes...
Or the moment has come...

1644
01:26:07,287 --> 01:26:09,080
I'm begging you,

1645
01:26:09,081 --> 01:26:11,499
let me go make sure things are fine.

1646
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:15,586
One way or the other. We're nearly done,

1647
01:26:15,587 --> 01:26:18,923
Mr. Engelhardt, please reconsider:

1648
01:26:18,924 --> 01:26:21,300
still find that point? Where might we

1649
01:26:21,301 --> 01:26:24,304
more intriguingly still: Or, wait,

1650
01:26:25,722 --> 01:26:29,851
How did the point disappear? Hm?

1651
01:26:29,852 --> 01:26:32,561
What do you mean? Maybe he had 5 points

1652
01:26:32,562 --> 01:26:34,064
and one was deducted.

1653
01:26:35,482 --> 01:26:38,484
Has very scrupulous methods
Our colleague surely

1654
01:26:38,485 --> 01:26:40,987
to deprive students of points:

1655
01:26:40,988 --> 01:26:42,571
Poor handwriting here,

1656
01:26:42,572 --> 01:26:45,533
stained homework there, things like that.

1657
01:26:45,534 --> 01:26:48,077
Open your little notebook Mr. Engelhardt,

1658
01:26:48,078 --> 01:26:50,706
and tell us what it says. Hm?

1659
01:26:53,542 --> 01:26:55,960
It's none of your damn business.

1660
01:26:55,961 --> 01:26:59,296
And check for myself. I swear I'll take it

1661
01:26:59,297 --> 01:27:02,175
You wouldn't understand my
system, anyway.

1662
01:27:02,176 --> 01:27:06,595
Of tallying up points and marks
It's a sophisticated method

1663
01:27:06,596 --> 01:27:09,640
that takes into account all the
parameters conceivably relevant

1664
01:27:09,641 --> 01:27:13,144
in assigning grades.

1665
01:27:13,145 --> 01:27:15,312
Namely? Topic-relevant quality,

1666
01:27:15,313 --> 01:27:17,857
style of presentation, that is, neatness.

1667
01:27:17,858 --> 01:27:19,859
Correctness I rate as a priority,

1668
01:27:19,860 --> 01:27:21,777
at about 71 percent. weighing it

1669
01:27:21,778 --> 01:27:23,821
Then comes style and handwriting,

1670
01:27:23,822 --> 01:27:26,365
of an oral performance, or the eloquence

1671
01:27:26,366 --> 01:27:27,992
if it's not written work,

1672
01:27:27,993 --> 01:27:30,203
in further deductions, that can result

1673
01:27:30,204 --> 01:27:31,830
additional points. or, rarely,

1674
01:27:32,998 --> 01:27:35,625
Now I want to know concretely, what...

1675
01:27:36,793 --> 01:27:39,837
get for his assignment? What did Fabian

1676
01:27:39,838 --> 01:27:41,338
What is entered there?

1677
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:51,182
Grades.

1678
01:27:52,642 --> 01:27:54,436
And which is the grade?

1679
01:28:01,401 --> 01:28:02,485
Fine.

1680
01:28:03,445 --> 01:28:05,654
I'll give in to the pressure.

1681
01:28:05,655 --> 01:28:08,033
A D grade, as you knew. Here you go.

1682
01:28:09,451 --> 01:28:12,954
I bet that's noted there.
Were there deductions?

1683
01:28:12,955 --> 01:28:14,997
You do. I don't have to tell you.

1684
01:28:14,998 --> 01:28:17,667
Or I'll break your fingers to get that.

1685
01:28:21,296 --> 01:28:22,922
One point.

1686
01:28:22,923 --> 01:28:24,507
"One point" what?

1687
01:28:29,429 --> 01:28:30,806
Had to be deducted.

1688
01:28:32,474 --> 01:28:35,102
Because of tardiness. Why?

1689
01:28:36,145 --> 01:28:37,352
Meaning what?

1690
01:28:37,353 --> 01:28:40,106
Handed his work in late. The student

1691
01:28:40,107 --> 01:28:43,067
How much too late? Explain what that means.

1692
01:28:43,068 --> 01:28:45,402
I'd agreed with the class It's simple:

1693
01:28:45,403 --> 01:28:49,531
that the big assignment had to
be with me by Tuesday at 1:00.

1694
01:28:49,532 --> 01:28:52,076
Everyone was punctual except Mr. Prohaska,

1695
01:28:52,077 --> 01:28:54,120
with his assignment. who was late

1696
01:28:54,121 --> 01:28:55,664
By how much?

1697
01:29:03,338 --> 01:29:04,422
Two.

1698
01:29:05,966 --> 01:29:07,716
"Two" what?

1699
01:29:07,717 --> 01:29:09,761
Days? Weeks?

1700
01:29:11,054 --> 01:29:13,306
What? Minutes.

1701
01:29:13,307 --> 01:29:15,641
He handed it in Two minutes.

1702
01:29:15,642 --> 01:29:18,352
While babbling something
about a jammed printer.

1703
01:29:18,353 --> 01:29:20,729
Among young people. A ruse typical

1704
01:29:20,730 --> 01:29:23,149
Everyone was on time except Fabian,

1705
01:29:23,150 --> 01:29:25,568
a one-point deduction. so he got

1706
01:29:26,653 --> 01:29:28,988
How was my son's assignment?

1707
01:29:28,989 --> 01:29:31,490
Fair in terms of content.

1708
01:29:31,491 --> 01:29:33,701
A tendency towards six, Five points.

1709
01:29:33,702 --> 01:29:35,244
But not enough to give them.

1710
01:29:35,245 --> 01:29:38,665
And a one-point deduction for tardiness.

1711
01:29:50,093 --> 01:29:52,261
You shitbag. PETER:

1712
01:29:52,262 --> 01:29:56,515
hypocritical old shitbag. You repulsive,

1713
01:29:56,516 --> 01:29:58,060
Two miserable minutes!

1714
01:29:58,977 --> 01:30:00,602
Two minutes?

1715
01:30:00,603 --> 01:30:03,231
He's not baccalaureate material
because of two minutes?

1716
01:30:03,232 --> 01:30:05,733
It's a question of justice!
The rest were on time.

1717
01:30:05,734 --> 01:30:08,319
Small-minded malice and
power, No, it's a question of

1718
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:10,280
you miserable old bastard.

1719
01:30:11,823 --> 01:30:14,033
Klaus!

1720
01:30:14,034 --> 01:30:15,408
Give me the notebook.

1721
01:30:17,411 --> 01:30:18,996
Who loves chemicals now?

1722
01:30:18,997 --> 01:30:20,206
Klaus!

1723
01:30:29,841 --> 01:30:32,594
Now... we vote.

1724
01:30:38,058 --> 01:30:39,475
Okay, come on.

1725
01:30:41,144 --> 01:30:42,229
Oh, man.

1726
01:30:54,699 --> 01:30:56,658
Fine.

1727
01:30:56,659 --> 01:30:58,411
Now we vote.

1728
01:30:58,412 --> 01:31:01,706
Of awarding one point? All those in favor

1729
01:31:07,087 --> 01:31:08,922
Klaus, I'm sorry.

1730
01:31:10,048 --> 01:31:12,300
With you anymore. I can't go along

1731
01:31:12,301 --> 01:31:15,386
You can't pocket money from a class trip,

1732
01:31:15,387 --> 01:31:19,223
while sealing a student's fate
because of a two-minute delay.

1733
01:31:19,224 --> 01:31:21,142
That won't do.

1734
01:31:21,143 --> 01:31:22,726
It won't do!

1735
01:31:22,727 --> 01:31:24,270
Raise your hand now.

1736
01:31:24,271 --> 01:31:28,399
Go on, Engelhardt, raise it.
Raise your hand!

1737
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:31,611
Please, Mr. Engelhardt, please.
So this all finds an end.

1738
01:31:35,282 --> 01:31:38,284
I will not raise my hand. Never.

1739
01:31:38,285 --> 01:31:40,829
Give him the point, Engelhardt.

1740
01:31:43,206 --> 01:31:44,374
Klaus, do it!

1741
01:31:47,252 --> 01:31:48,337
Do it.

1742
01:32:08,357 --> 01:32:09,816
Just do it, Engelhardt.

1743
01:32:21,744 --> 01:32:23,329
Police!

1744
01:32:23,330 --> 01:32:24,830
Drop the gun!

1745
01:32:24,831 --> 01:32:26,499
Drop it!

1746
01:32:26,500 --> 01:32:29,043
Down on the ground!

1747
01:32:29,044 --> 01:32:31,086
On the ground!

1748
01:32:31,087 --> 01:32:32,587
Get down!

1749
01:32:43,141 --> 01:32:45,851
That's right, nice and easy. EMT:

1750
01:32:45,852 --> 01:32:47,979
Just around here.

1751
01:32:48,897 --> 01:32:50,357
Take a step up.

1752
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:53,442
And be seated.

1753
01:33:16,258 --> 01:33:19,093
Go buy some. Got a spare smoke?

1754
01:33:19,094 --> 01:33:20,511
Snitch.

1755
01:33:20,512 --> 01:33:21,594
Dick.

1756
01:33:21,595 --> 01:33:22,721
Listen, officer,

1757
01:33:22,722 --> 01:33:25,266
I need to get into my chemistry room.

1758
01:33:25,267 --> 01:33:27,809
You're staying here. We need a statement.

1759
01:33:27,810 --> 01:33:29,228
I've told you all I know.

1760
01:33:29,229 --> 01:33:31,146
With something else. You'll come up

1761
01:33:32,399 --> 01:33:33,858
Beinacker!

1762
01:33:41,032 --> 01:33:43,576
How are things? It's all fine.

1763
01:33:43,577 --> 01:33:46,161
Good work. No injuries.

1764
01:33:46,162 --> 01:33:48,830
Nothing beats experience and intuition.

1765
01:33:48,831 --> 01:33:51,251
I didn't mean you. Thanks, Boss.

1766
01:34:02,929 --> 01:34:04,680
Can I use my phone?

1767
01:34:05,723 --> 01:34:06,933
I'm afraid not.

1768
01:34:09,269 --> 01:34:12,146
I just wanted to call my wife.

1769
01:34:12,147 --> 01:34:13,814
May I, please?

1770
01:34:18,236 --> 01:34:20,904
I can't remove the cuffs,

1771
01:34:20,905 --> 01:34:24,199
but I can unlock your phone
and put it on speaker.

1772
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:25,285
Thanks.

1773
01:34:26,495 --> 01:34:28,538
It's here, in my pocket.

1774
01:34:34,377 --> 01:34:35,877
The code is:

1775
01:34:35,878 --> 01:34:37,921
1, 2,

1776
01:34:37,922 --> 01:34:39,257
3, 4.

1777
01:34:41,551 --> 01:34:42,884
You have voicemail.

1778
01:34:42,885 --> 01:34:45,597
Want me to play it for you? I won't listen.

1779
01:34:47,015 --> 01:34:49,725
Worried that I missed dinner.
It'll be my wife,

1780
01:34:51,102 --> 01:34:52,854
My son will be waiting, too.

1781
01:34:54,147 --> 01:34:55,649
I fought for him.

1782
01:35:00,862 --> 01:35:02,905
Hey, Dad. It's Fabi. VOICEMAIL:

1783
01:35:03,823 --> 01:35:05,908
Listen, the thing is...

1784
01:35:07,118 --> 01:35:09,286
where you are right now, I don't know

1785
01:35:09,287 --> 01:35:11,289
but by the time you get home,

1786
01:35:12,457 --> 01:35:14,668
well, I'll be gone.

1787
01:35:16,794 --> 01:35:19,088
I'd wanted to tell you yesterday, but...

1788
01:35:20,340 --> 01:35:23,467
after our conversation. I didn't dare

1789
01:35:23,468 --> 01:35:25,427
You were so upset.

1790
01:35:25,428 --> 01:35:28,472
I've thought about the baccalaureate,

1791
01:35:28,473 --> 01:35:29,807
studying and all that.

1792
01:35:31,809 --> 01:35:34,395
Maybe Engelhardt is right. You know,

1793
01:35:34,396 --> 01:35:36,188
university material. Maybe I'm not

1794
01:35:36,189 --> 01:35:40,276
And maybe I shouldn't
take the baccalaureate,

1795
01:35:41,403 --> 01:35:43,238
but do something else.

1796
01:35:46,157 --> 01:35:48,242
Maybe that one point is like a sign

1797
01:35:48,243 --> 01:35:50,412
on the wrong track. that I've been

1798
01:35:51,413 --> 01:35:53,706
I know it's a bit late, but...

1799
01:35:53,707 --> 01:35:56,749
to me yesterday, and he said
Engelhardt came and talked

1800
01:35:56,750 --> 01:35:58,711
as an opportunity I should take it

1801
01:35:58,712 --> 01:36:00,129
to change my perspective.

1802
01:36:02,424 --> 01:36:04,175
I guess he's right.

1803
01:36:05,093 --> 01:36:07,802
He's pretty okay, really.

1804
01:36:07,803 --> 01:36:10,097
So what I wanted to say,

1805
01:36:10,098 --> 01:36:11,932
is you don't have to be pissed with him

1806
01:36:11,933 --> 01:36:13,058
about that one damn point.

1807
01:36:13,059 --> 01:36:15,228
Really. It doesn't matter.

1808
01:36:16,770 --> 01:36:20,358
Anyway, I think I just
need to get away for a bit.

1809
01:36:22,151 --> 01:36:25,154
I got from Grandma for my 18th.
I took the money

1810
01:36:26,114 --> 01:36:27,990
It's enough for a ticket to...

1811
01:36:29,242 --> 01:36:31,578
you know, to go surfing.

1812
01:36:32,287 --> 01:36:33,495
Okay.

1813
01:36:33,496 --> 01:36:35,456
I gotta go.

1814
01:36:35,457 --> 01:36:38,709
In a couple of months, that is.
But I'll be back soon.

1815
01:36:40,086 --> 01:36:42,504
Then I'll start something else.

1816
01:36:42,505 --> 01:36:44,048
You'll see.

1817
01:36:45,300 --> 01:36:47,719
So don't worry now, okay?

1818
01:36:49,178 --> 01:36:51,054
Okay.

1819
01:36:51,055 --> 01:36:53,266
Don't worry. I'll be in touch.

1820
01:36:55,851 --> 01:36:57,645
Bye, Dad.

1821
01:36:57,646 --> 01:36:59,063
Yours, Fabi.
