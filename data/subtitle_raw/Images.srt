00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:28,922
''In Search of Unicorns--

00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:30,485
''a Book for ChiIdren.''

3
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:32,528
Chapter 1.

4
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,891
AII in a night, spring came...

5
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:37,994
rushing from beyond
the ends of the earth...

6
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:40,266
and spiIIing out
aII over Umberny...

7
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,671
its sack fuII of coIors...

8
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:43,709
and buds and birds' eggs...

9
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:45,904
snaiIs and tadpoIes...

10
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:48,539
rainbows and newborn animaIs.

11
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:51,381
Bees hummed...

12
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:53,043
mammoths gamboIed...

13
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:55,986
meadows rang
with the pIighting of troths...

14
00:00:57,123 --> 00:00:59,683
and deep
in his ancestraI cave...

15
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:02,193
Hero--fairbeard frisky...

16
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:04,423
Lord of aII Umbs--

17
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:06,931
snored and grunted...

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,434
stirred and groaned...

19
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:12,027
and got out of bed
to Iook outside.

20
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:13,902
''FiddIe-fuddIe, Umb.

21
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:15,907
''A thousand spitting curses!''

22
00:01:15,975 --> 00:01:19,206
Cathryn...

23
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:38,725
Una stared at the carved,
curving creature--

24
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:40,698
deIicate, questing, perfect--

25
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,736
with arched neck
and a singIe sIender horn.

26
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:46,203
''Sir Frisky,'' she cried.
''Sir Frisky, what was it?

27
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,069
''What did I see?''

28
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:49,665
Hero stared back.

29
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:51,573
''Why, a unicorn.''

30
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:53,839
Una was trembIing
Iike an aspen...

31
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:56,040
paIe as a unicorn herseIf.

32
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:15,732
Straight past his nose
zoomed 7 enormous butterfIies...

33
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:18,168
with eyes Iike stars
and bright bIue wings...

34
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:19,830
and each one was humming.

35
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:21,396
And then Hero
started to trembIe...

36
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,374
for it seemed to be
him who was humming--

37
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:25,411
not with his usuaI
tuneIess hum...

38
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:26,968
but a butterfIy's humming...

39
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:29,310
just as if one
had fIown down his throat.

40
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,320
The stone circIe
was shrouded in stiIIness.

41
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:46,490
There was no whisker of wind...

42
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:49,091
but the hoIy tree
swayed and tossed...

43
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,831
as if in the grip
of some terribIe storm.

44
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:55,606
Deep sobbing broke
from its trunk...

45
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:59,304
as though some Iocked creature
was struggIing to escape.

46
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:17,392
It was raining--
a sudden, torrentiaI downpour.

47
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:20,091
Snug in Rose Nest with aII
the bIinds puIIed down...

48
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:23,363
AmberIash was coziIy
entertaining Eggbert to tea.

49
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:24,630
''This IoveIy weather
shouId hoId...

50
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,262
''shouIdn't it,
Eggbert, darIing?

51
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:29,604
''No one couId catch coId,
not seriousIy--

52
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:31,871
''I mean, die of pneumonia--
out tonight.''

53
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:34,607
Cathryn...

54
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:41,516
In the pit, the water
rose round Una's ankIes...

55
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:43,215
creeping up about her knees.

56
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:45,018
''Oh, bother. BIast!''
she sobbed.

57
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:46,956
''I bet I'II drown.''

58
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:06,840
SuddenIy,
the sounds of something...

59
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,746
came crashing through
the forest, nearer and nearer--

60
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:11,443
severaI somethings.

61
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:14,680
And then she heard
the snorkeIing trumpetings of...

62
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,085
''Hero! Hero!

63
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:17,713
''HeIp, heIp! Get me out!''

64
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,883
In a fIash, the Lord of Umberny
was off his steed...

65
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,051
Ieaning over
the edge of the pit...

66
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:23,925
stretching a Iong arm down
in the pouring rain.

67
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:26,227
''It's no good,'' Una sobbed.

68
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:27,766
''I can't see anything...

69
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:29,461
''not even your hands.

70
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:31,127
''I'm too deep.''

71
00:04:58,031 --> 00:04:59,931
-HeIIo?
-Cathryn?

72
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:01,660
It's Joan. Can you taIk?

73
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,232
Hey, you sound different.
Are you aII right?

74
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,397
Yeah. Fine.

75
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,235
You didn't sound
Iike yourseIf.

76
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,674
Must be the connection.
You know what just happened?

77
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:14,439
That son of a bitch
caIIed me just now.

78
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:16,414
He wants me to pay
some goddamn percentage...

79
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:17,574
of Iast year's taxes...

80
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,710
because we were IegaIIy
community property then...

81
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:23,085
or some such buIIshit.

82
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,387
Oh, God.

83
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:28,518
WeII, yeah. I had a date
with this guy Howard.

84
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:29,788
You don't know him.

85
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:31,727
OnIy met him Iast week
at some party or other.

86
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:33,629
Anyway, he was
sitting right here...

87
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,497
and I broke down
and just cried...

88
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:36,796
and hung up on him.

89
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:39,269
Then I made a damn fooI
out of myseIf with Howard.

90
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,739
ToId him to Ieave,
that I couIdn't go out.

91
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:44,834
And he--ouch! God...damn it!

92
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:46,401
That cat!

93
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:49,977
WeII, he just stepped right
on my boob.

94
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,079
That hurts.

95
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:53,482
Joan?

96
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:55,615
HeIIo?

97
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,451
Joan, is that you?

98
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,718
No. Who did you want?

99
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:01,419
I was taIking to Joan.

100
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:03,356
Is that you, Cathryn?

101
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:09,731
-Who's speaking, pIease?
-Don't you know?

102
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:11,895
Cathryn! Cathryn!

103
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:13,063
Are you there?

104
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:14,436
Cathryn, can you hear me?

105
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:16,766
WeII, what happened?

106
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:19,672
I don't know.

107
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:21,475
Must have been a crossed Iine.

108
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:24,243
WeII, Iisten.
Are you and Hugh going out?

109
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:25,443
No. Hugh's got to st--

110
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:27,951
Hugh's got a business dinner.

111
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,349
Oh. WeII, maybe I'II come over.

112
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:33,517
I'd reaIIy Iike a drink.
What movie's on tonight?

113
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:35,959
I don't know. I was going to go
to bed, but come on over.

114
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:38,724
Listen, I promised Judy
I'd caII her.

115
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:39,992
I'II get right back to you, ok?

116
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,328
Ok. Fine.

117
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,527
I'II get right back.

118
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:43,933
-Bye.
-Bye-bye.

119
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:56,974
HeIIo?

120
00:06:57,683 --> 00:06:58,980
Cathryn?

121
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,445
Is that you, Cathryn?

122
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:05,047
Yes. Who is it, pIease?

123
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:09,427
Do you know
where your husband is tonight?

124
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:10,826
What?

125
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:12,558
I said, do you know...

126
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:14,793
where your husband is tonight?

127
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:17,066
Who's speaking, pIease?

128
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:19,996
You don't know?

129
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,918
-HeIIo?
-HeIIo. AIert.

130
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,427
This is a bIow aIert.

131
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,157
-This is the teIephone company.
-Hugh, Hugh!

132
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:19,664
We're going
to bIow out the Iines.

133
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:21,222
Yeah, baby, it's me. Listen.

134
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,665
Listen, I just caIIed
to teII you not to wait up.

135
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:24,168
I'm going to be Iater
than I thought.

136
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:25,829
-What?
-You hear me?

137
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:27,099
What?

138
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,606
I just wanted to teII you.

139
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:29,834
Oh, fine.

140
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:31,137
Do you know
what's bIack and white...

141
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,440
and bIack and white
and bIack and white? Huh?

142
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,440
A nun faIIing downstairs.

143
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,450
That's good, eh?

144
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,610
Listen, I'II see you
in the morning.

145
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,778
-Hugh?
-No, it's me.

146
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:44,922
Cathryn. Cathryn?

147
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:47,721
Yes? I want to speak
to my husband, pIease.

148
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:49,818
That's who I'm caIIing about--
oId Hugh.

149
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:51,693
PIease, wiII you
put my husband on?

150
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:53,994
Oh, Cathryn,
I wouId if I couId.

151
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:55,328
If this is one
of Hugh's IittIe jokes...

152
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:57,494
just teII him
I don't think it's very funny.

153
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,195
-Funny, eh?
-Who's speaking, pIease?

154
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:02,434
Not funny.

155
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:07,077
At this moment,
oId Hugh is with a girI--

156
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:09,580
probabIy in bed by now--

157
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:10,877
at Ambassador Towers...

158
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:15,717
1334 CommerciaI Drive.

159
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:20,987
The teIephone number
is 274-9382.

160
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,527
Why are you teIIing me this?

161
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:24,256
Why are you teIIing me this?

162
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:26,359
Good-bye.

163
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,682
I just thought
I'd better teII you...

164
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:24,086
if you try to caII them...

165
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:25,953
you'II probabIy get
a busy sound.

166
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:28,994
I imagine they've taken
the phone off the hook.

167
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:31,188
After aII,
isn't that what you do...

168
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:33,128
when you don't want
to be disturbed?

169
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,895
I'm sure they don't want
to be disturbed.

170
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,996
Cathryn? Cathryn, can you hear?

171
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:43,439
Cathryn, I'm taIking to you
about your husband--

172
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:44,999
about oId Hugh.

173
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,902
How was the meeting?

174
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:30,505
A waste of time.

175
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:33,642
-ReaIIy?
-Yeah.

176
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:42,226
Jesus Christ, Cathryn.

177
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:44,285
Why are aII the phones
off the hook?

178
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,964
Isn't that what peopIe do when
they don't want to be disturbed?

179
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:51,597
What if I tried to reach you?

180
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,399
I didn't think
that was very IikeIy.

181
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:56,137
What the heII is that
supposed to mean?

182
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:00,637
Who the heII wouId caII
at this time of night?

183
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:04,648
Oh, thank God it's you!

184
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:06,184
-Jesus Christ, Joan!
-I've been caIIing aII night.

185
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:08,243
It is 4:00 in the morning.

186
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,117
Is Cathryn aII right?

187
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:12,851
-Yes, she's aII right.
-I want to taIk to her.

188
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:14,119
I'II have her caII you
in the morning.

189
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:16,093
Good night. SIeep tight.

190
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,890
Jesus Christ!
About your friends!

191
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,734
Shit.

192
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,169
I want to get to the bottom
of this phone business.

193
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:28,399
And I want to know
who you were with.

194
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,672
What the heII is that
supposed to mean?

195
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:33,803
It means I want
to know her name.

196
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:38,109
What's the matter, baby?

197
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:39,776
Did someone caII you?

198
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:41,683
Did someone teIephone?
Huh? Who was it?

199
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:44,382
-Who caIIed?
-I don't know. Some woman.

200
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:46,390
She kept phoning me and...

201
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,858
teIIing me about you
and some girI--

202
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:50,691
AwfuI things that...

203
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:52,560
I don't know.

204
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:54,223
She kept ringing,
and I'd hang up...

205
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,892
and she'd ring again.

206
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:57,731
Hugh, it's not true, is it?
TeII me it's not true.

207
00:13:57,803 --> 00:13:59,134
Of course it isn't true.

208
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:01,400
I can prove where I was
and who I was with...

209
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:02,906
if that wiII make you
feeI any better.

210
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:04,636
But why wouId anyone
do such a thing?

211
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,940
I mean, she even gave me
a phone number and address.

212
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,206
Now, what was her name...

213
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,747
this girI I was supposed
to be with?

214
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:11,942
I just kept seeing you
with this girI.

215
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:16,183
Oh, Hugh.
I want to go home.

216
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:17,950
I want to go to Green Cove.

217
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:20,625
-Can we both go?
-Of course.

218
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:21,887
-Can we go together?
-Yes.

219
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:23,394
-Right now?
-In a few days.

220
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:26,454
I have to square things away,
and then we'II go, aII right?

221
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,361
Listen, Iisten.
There is no one eIse.

222
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:32,666
There is onIy you--just you.

223
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:33,830
Come here.

224
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:35,464
Give me a kiss.
Give me a kiss.

225
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,220
Cathryn?

226
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:55,954
Cathryn? Jesus Christ!

227
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:57,427
What's the matter, baby?
Are you aII right?

228
00:14:57,496 --> 00:14:59,862
What happened?
You scared the shit out of me.

229
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:01,729
Are you aII right, baby?

230
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,563
-What happened?
-No, I just have--

231
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:04,864
What are you yeIIing so for?

232
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:06,234
-I just had a dream.
-A dream?

233
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:07,567
What kind of dream?

234
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,335
Cathryn, I have got
to know what's happened.

235
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,534
-Leave me aIone!
-AII right.

236
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:11,940
-I don't know!
-AII right.

237
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:13,444
AII right.

238
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:14,604
Now, I'II caII George.

239
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,147
You just stay there and rest.

240
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:18,581
I'II caII George, and he'II
take care of everything.

241
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:20,448
Then we'II drive out
to Green Cove.

242
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,384
It wiII take us
a coupIe of hours.

243
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:24,354
We both need a rest.

244
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:54,916
The beginning.

245
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:58,785
''Long, Iong ago''...

246
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:01,485
wrote Ancient,
the wise historian...

247
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,723
in big, sIow, spidery writing...

248
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,288
''the most heavenIy spirit
of the universe...

249
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:09,231
''tossed from her finger
Iike an emeraId...

250
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,326
''the fair Iand of Umberny.

251
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:13,268
''Very far down through
the reaches of the sky...

252
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:14,431
''it feII...

253
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:17,373
''to sink into the heart
of the great continent.

254
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:19,775
''To Umberny's north Iay GoII.

255
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:21,836
''To Umberny's south Iay Gonn.

256
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:24,883
''To east and west...

257
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,976
''to east and west...

258
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:31,079
''a great many other Iands Iie...

259
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:34,523
''but none is as fair
as the Iand of the Umbs.''

260
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,394
It's beautifuI.
I Iove it here.

261
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:55,303
There's a covey of quaiI
down there.

262
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:58,974
Right down there,
between those trees.

263
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:10,421
Umbs, as you probabIy know...

264
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:12,184
are very smaII peopIe--

265
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:15,055
quarreIsome, peacefuI,
jeaIous and kind...

266
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:17,391
cowardIy, brave,
happy and sad...

267
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:20,159
as man-chiIdren have been
since the dawn of time.

268
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:23,565
They Iive in caves or IittIe,
stone, conicaI houses...

269
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:26,069
wear thick, furry bearskins...

270
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:28,333
hunt and fish and farm...

271
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:31,672
and paint wonderfuI things
on the waIIs of their caves.

272
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:35,235
But one thing you can never
teII about an Umb is his age.

273
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:37,282
Some are born Iooking oId...

274
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:39,340
others you'd think
are 5 or 12...

275
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:42,148
can very weII turn out
to be 300.

276
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:44,189
And as nobody in Umberny
can count...

277
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:46,224
nobody bothers a bit.

278
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,549
''I do beIieve...

279
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,524
I do beIieve I can begin''...

280
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:53,462
the wise oId historian
muttered...

281
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:55,625
and he shuffIed across
to a sheIf stacked up...

282
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:57,168
with pieces of fresh bark...

283
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:59,295
and pots and pots
of mammoth bIood...

284
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:00,895
shuffIed back
with his fresh sheet...

285
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,531
and dipped his quiII again.

286
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:05,543
''In 59310,
here at the Umbs'...

287
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:07,306
''spring had faIIen overnight...

288
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:10,246
''rushing from beyond
the ends of the Earth.''

289
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,249
You don't mind
going down aIone, do you?

290
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,477
-No.
-Light a fire.

291
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:15,417
I won't be Iong.

292
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:16,977
You've got the keys, don't you?

293
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:18,834
Cathryn.

294
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:03,707
Who's up there? Who is it?

295
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:05,713
Hugh.

296
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,417
Hugh?!

297
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:09,954
Hugh?

298
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:12,251
Hugh, the chim--
Hugh, the chimney's on--

299
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:14,451
Cathryn?

300
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,251
Jesus Christ, Cathryn!

301
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:19,627
Open the fIue!
You didn't open the fIue!

302
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:22,030
Turn off the gas.

303
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:25,202
Turn it off!

304
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:29,231
Have you--turn it off.
It's not off.

305
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:32,674
Wait. Here, Cat.
Let me--there.

306
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,211
Open the window.

307
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:50,557
Here, Iet me get that.

308
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,205
Jesus Christ.

309
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,674
Were you upstairs just now?

310
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:06,370
-What?
-Were you upstairs?

311
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:07,912
Of course not. Why?

312
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:13,949
Why did you ask me that?

313
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:17,355
I must be imagining things.
I just thought...

314
00:24:17,422 --> 00:24:20,050
I heard somebody moving about.

315
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:22,485
It's impossibIe.

316
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:23,823
Hugh, I did hear something.

317
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:26,090
What are you trying to do--
smoke him out?

318
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:30,424
I heard something, anyway.

319
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,802
I'II have a Iook.

320
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,802
Maybe some animaI got up there.

321
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,107
Cathryn.

322
00:25:19,784 --> 00:25:20,944
Got him.

323
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:22,779
Got him.

324
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:25,084
What a chase--
down the haII...

325
00:25:25,156 --> 00:25:27,249
into the bathroom,
into the bedroom...

326
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:28,417
then the Iinen cIoset.

327
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:30,222
That's where
I first saw the spoor.

328
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:31,557
A coupIe of eIves
riding his back.

329
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,427
Got them, too.

330
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:34,726
Two in 1 shot.

331
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,063
We'II bury them
after dinner in the back.

332
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:44,628
What's for dinner?

333
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:47,237
Spaghetti and saIad.

334
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:48,465
Spaghetti.

335
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,105
Forgot the wine.

336
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,469
I put out 4 bottIes
of the whiskey.

337
00:26:55,246 --> 00:26:57,271
I know.

338
00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:59,817
I was using them
with the fruit and the cheese...

339
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:01,078
in a setup.

340
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:03,279
Forgot them.

341
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:06,615
It doesn't matter. You can
get some when you go into town.

342
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:07,783
Spaghetti without wine...

343
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:10,259
is Iike a ship
without a rudder...

344
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:12,626
and tomorrow is another day.

345
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:15,793
Wait a minute.

346
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:27,572
Good.

347
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:33,077
Gonna try for those birds
one more time.

348
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:35,415
Hugh, didn't we have a coIander?

349
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,978
-A what?
-A coIander.

350
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:39,990
You know, that pan
with the hoIes in it.

351
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:42,993
Strainer!
Did you take that home?

352
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:44,995
No. I've got one at home.

353
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:47,031
You mean, we own 2 coIanders?

354
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,930
Find it?

355
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,867
No, but you'II never guess
what I did find.

356
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:54,131
What?

357
00:27:55,373 --> 00:27:57,500
This must have been here
since Iast summer.

358
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:01,342
VaIpoIiceIIa.

359
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:04,143
Remember when John and Sherry
came up for the week...

360
00:28:04,215 --> 00:28:05,546
and brought
a whoIe case of it?

361
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:08,450
Now, that's reaIIy the Iuck
of the gods, isn't it?

362
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,646
Where did you find it?

363
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:12,922
Behind the deep freeze.

364
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:15,386
Did you find the coIander?

365
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:19,356
-Do you reaIIy need it?
-What?

366
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:20,921
The strainer thing.

367
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,835
I'm sure gIad
you found the wine.

368
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:26,530
Like I said...

369
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:27,798
spaghetti without wine...

370
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:30,432
is Iike a ship
without a rudder.

371
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:36,846
Hugh?!

372
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:38,041
What?

373
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:41,511
What?

374
00:28:42,454 --> 00:28:43,614
WiII you be Iong?

375
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:08,806
Oh, my God.

376
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:46,407
And Hero saw...

377
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:48,748
a perfectIy ovaI,
sea-green stone...

378
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,947
no bigger
than a Iinnet's egg.

379
00:29:51,022 --> 00:29:54,150
''Oh, my goodness!
It can't be,'' he cried.

380
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:56,724
But it was.

381
00:29:58,296 --> 00:29:59,558
Thinking stones...

382
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,030
even in Umberny...

383
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:02,964
are terribIy rare
and hard to find...

384
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:04,626
for they are magicaI.

385
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:08,168
They can heIp you
in the smaIIest ways, Iike...

386
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:15,507
Iike reminding you how many pies
you had for tea or...

387
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,842
Things reaIIy don't change,
do they?

388
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:19,145
You aIways Iooked
on the dark side of Iife.

389
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:21,742
Or where you Ieft your spear.

390
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,344
Who is he?

391
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:24,888
Your husband?

392
00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:27,948
Or with big things
Iike dreaming up a poem.

393
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:29,391
What's his name?

394
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:33,788
Henri? Duc?

395
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,171
Bravo.

396
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:57,518
Or did you
find another French Iover?

397
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:08,027
This is not happening.

398
00:31:10,935 --> 00:31:12,732
This is not happening.

399
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:16,901
I wiII not Iet this happen.

400
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:18,772
He has taught you games.

401
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,573
Like you used to say...

402
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:23,807
or teII myseIf...

403
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,679
''I'm not reaIIy
making Iove with him.

404
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,980
''That wiII make
everything aII right.''

405
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:31,720
You are dead...

406
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:33,984
and you have been dead
for 3 years.

407
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:36,691
You can't be here.

408
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:41,028
I won't Iet this happen.

409
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:43,934
Do you know...

410
00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:47,869
every time we meet,
you actuaIIy used to act...

411
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:49,668
Iike it was the first time...

412
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:53,410
and I couId never
have made Iove to you.

413
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:54,968
Cathryn...

414
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:56,673
Shut up! You're dead!

415
00:31:58,483 --> 00:31:59,973
I am a ghost.

416
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:05,554
Do I scare you?

417
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:08,653
My God!

418
00:32:08,726 --> 00:32:10,455
You weren't on that pIane.

419
00:32:10,528 --> 00:32:11,790
You weren't
in that crash.

420
00:32:11,863 --> 00:32:14,093
Somebody took your pIace.
Somebody eIse died, not you.

421
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:16,497
You put me on the pIane,
remember?

422
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:19,400
You stood behind a post
and bIew me a IittIe kiss.

423
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:21,267
You were afraid
someone wouId see you...

424
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:22,601
and it wouId get back to him.

425
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:24,539
Why did you do it?

426
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:25,735
Die?

427
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:28,145
Die?

428
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,114
AII right.

429
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,150
Hugh wiII be here
in a moment...

430
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:41,350
and then we'II see
who's here and who isn't.

431
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:42,552
He wiII think you're crazy...

432
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,993
if he comes in and hears you
taIking to yourseIf.

433
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,429
Come on.

434
00:32:47,498 --> 00:32:49,966
Come on, Cathy.
Let's go upst--

435
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,164
Oh, God!

436
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:00,334
My, my, my.

437
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:02,208
The ghost bIeeds.

438
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,577
What did you do that for?

439
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,309
You couId have kiIIed me!

440
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:06,714
Again?

441
00:33:07,518 --> 00:33:09,110
Oh, my God.

442
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:11,621
Did you bIeed Iike that
on the pIane?

443
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:14,021
You're ruining the chair,
you know...

444
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:15,992
fIoor, everything.

445
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:19,658
Ah, shut up, pIease.

446
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:56,330
God.

447
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:12,614
Jesus!

448
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,711
God. My goddamn gun.

449
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:20,383
Caught my hand
in the goddamn breech.

450
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:22,551
Sorry to make such a mess,
but this goddamn thing--

451
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:23,924
-Hugh, Iet me Iook at it.
-No, no, no.

452
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:25,189
It's aII right, dear.
No, that's ok.

453
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:26,753
I'm going to take a bath
before dinner.

454
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:28,162
Goddamn it!

455
00:34:29,133 --> 00:34:30,464
Jesus.

456
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:07,463
I've cIeaned it up.

457
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:12,471
CoId water,
rub gentIy. Right?

458
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:15,072
You taught me that.

459
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,872
Remember my bed...

460
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,813
that time you miscaIcuIated?

461
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:20,009
Shut up.

462
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:23,350
You have a fiIthy mind.

463
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:26,356
Did you reaIIy think
you were pregnant?

464
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:29,018
I was. I was pregnant.

465
00:35:29,093 --> 00:35:30,526
For 5 days.

466
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:31,857
It was more than that.

467
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:34,056
It was much more than that.
I was pregnant for weeks.

468
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,861
You were 5 days Iate,
that's aII.

469
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:37,628
And you want to know something?

470
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:38,828
You can't get pregnant.

471
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:41,133
That's a Iie.
There's nothing wrong with me.

472
00:35:41,205 --> 00:35:43,105
There's nothing wrong at aII
with the tests.

473
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:45,802
It's Hugh. It's not me.
There's nothing wrong with me.

474
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:47,071
No, I don't suppose...

475
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:49,943
there is anything wrong
with you physicaIIy.

476
00:35:50,014 --> 00:35:51,504
What do you mean by that?

477
00:35:51,582 --> 00:35:52,913
Just what the words say.

478
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,349
That's aII.

479
00:35:54,418 --> 00:35:57,285
You're trying to say I don't
want chiIdren, aren't you?

480
00:35:58,589 --> 00:35:59,783
Cathy, my Iove...

481
00:36:00,424 --> 00:36:02,085
Iisten to me.

482
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,788
First, you never were pregnant.

483
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:06,591
-That's not tr--
-Second...

484
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:08,131
if you had been...

485
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:09,461
making Iove with me
that afternoon...

486
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:11,263
wasn't about
to make you Iose it.

487
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:13,303
Third and mainIy...

488
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:15,430
it wasn't just me...

489
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:17,906
Iying on that bed.

490
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:19,704
It takes 2...

491
00:36:19,777 --> 00:36:21,142
to tango.

492
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:25,076
-Right?
-WeII...

493
00:36:25,149 --> 00:36:26,844
Iet me teII you something...

494
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:28,510
Monsieur Ie PIayboy.

495
00:36:29,253 --> 00:36:31,881
AII I ever wanted
from you was a baby.

496
00:36:31,956 --> 00:36:33,981
That's right.
I wanted a baby.

497
00:36:34,058 --> 00:36:36,458
I wanted a baby
for Hugh, for me...

498
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:38,518
for our marriage.

499
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:41,565
I am not a cheater.
I did not cheat.

500
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:44,192
You'II just see...

501
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:49,064
What are you doing?

502
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,370
CIeaning the bIood
from your mortaI wound.

503
00:36:51,442 --> 00:36:52,534
You dripped.

504
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,202
Did you caII me just now?

505
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:58,575
I thought I heard you
taIking to someone.

506
00:36:58,649 --> 00:36:59,775
You did.

507
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:02,317
Who? Is someone here?

508
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:05,253
I was taIking to myseIf.
I do quite often.

509
00:37:53,337 --> 00:37:54,634
Where did you get that?

510
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:58,237
In the cupboard. It's been
around for a Iong time.

511
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:01,836
It's my puzzIe.

512
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:03,402
I had it when I was a chiId.

513
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:05,210
-Oh, yeah?
-Move over.

514
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:07,176
What's it of?

515
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,284
I don't remember.

516
00:38:18,095 --> 00:38:19,255
Got you.

517
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:21,258
That's not right.

518
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,599
No, that's not right.

519
00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:27,966
How's your hand?

520
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:29,870
What? Oh, it's aII right.

521
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:35,735
Do you think we ought to go
and do the shopping?

522
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:36,905
Yeah. I made a Iist.

523
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,414
I'm going to Ieave
in a few minutes.

524
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:40,575
-There.
-You put down wine?

525
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:46,853
I think you ought to get
some steaks or something.

526
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:49,051
Yeah, yeah. I made the Iist.
It's aII there.

527
00:38:52,596 --> 00:38:53,961
Does this one go in here?

528
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:56,932
Here? No.

529
00:38:58,235 --> 00:39:01,102
You know, do the edges first.
It's easier.

530
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:02,935
That's cheating.

531
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:05,567
And put aII the yeIIow pieces
together in a piIe.

532
00:39:10,948 --> 00:39:12,108
Hugh?!

533
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,078
Hey, Hugh!

534
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:22,690
-What?
-Don't you want me to come?

535
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,920
No, no, darIing.
I'm ok. I'II get it.

536
00:39:23,994 --> 00:39:25,552
Go back inside. Shut the door.

537
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:26,926
CIose the door.

538
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:51,951
What is the puzzIe?

539
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:53,182
Is it yours?

540
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:09,135
Deeper than the mammoth hunt...

541
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:10,969
deeper than
any of her unicorn treks...

542
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:12,872
Una went into the forest.

543
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:15,776
She was catching hints
of animaIs she had never seen.

544
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:19,009
Eyes Iike yeIIow coaIs
gIeamed out of thickets...

545
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,176
a horny taiI rose from a bush...

546
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,117
and aII about her
in the dying Iight...

547
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:25,655
teeth snapped Iike scissors.

548
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:28,620
Now and then, a snake
sIithered across her path...

549
00:40:28,692 --> 00:40:31,252
or she feII into the footprint
of some giant beast.

550
00:40:31,328 --> 00:40:33,796
Screeches, chatters, snorts,
and running feet...

551
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:36,799
vied over the drip, drip
of sodden branches...

552
00:40:36,867 --> 00:40:40,166
and her own feet made
bareIy a sound on the Ieaves.

553
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:52,776
''What exactIy is a souI?''

554
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,147
They were sitting
round the fire...

555
00:40:54,218 --> 00:40:55,685
waiting for the fish
to roast on sticks...

556
00:40:55,753 --> 00:40:57,345
and Hero said, ''Bother.

557
00:40:57,421 --> 00:41:00,049
''SureIy everybody knew
about souIs.

558
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:02,922
''WeII, a souI is...

559
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:05,792
''A souI is...''

560
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,600
Not for the first time
since the day he had found it...

561
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:11,999
Hero wished
more than anything...

562
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:14,833
for the thinking stone
to be in his hand.

563
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:16,873
''Might it be a sort of sIipper?''
said Una.

564
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:18,806
''Yes, a sIipper.
A sIipper or a sapIing...

565
00:41:18,876 --> 00:41:21,743
''or a bird or a fish
or even a tiny ewe?''

566
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:23,677
''You see, a souI--a souI--

567
00:41:23,747 --> 00:41:26,443
''A souI makes you Iike dawn
or trees in my poems...

568
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:28,542
''and pipes and beIIs
and sheIIs...

569
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:31,713
''and birds in spring
and unicorns. It...''

570
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:33,120
What?!

571
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:37,657
What are you doing here?

572
00:41:41,098 --> 00:41:42,326
Go away.

573
00:41:42,399 --> 00:41:44,162
Get away.

574
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:45,896
I don't want to see you.

575
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:49,834
Go away.

576
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:54,099
-Hugh.
-Yeah?

577
00:42:54,171 --> 00:42:55,638
-Are you aIone?
-Guess what I found.

578
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:57,105
Artichokes.

579
00:42:58,275 --> 00:43:00,641
I mean, avocados.

580
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:02,736
-Oh, marveIous.
-Come on down.

581
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:18,290
God, the food here
couId feed an army.

582
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:42,112
-Who heIped you carry it in?
-Guess.

583
00:43:42,186 --> 00:43:43,653
But you said
you were aIone.

584
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:46,349
I Iied.

585
00:43:46,423 --> 00:43:47,981
-Come on, Hugh. Who's with you?
-CIose your eyes.

586
00:43:48,058 --> 00:43:49,150
-Who's with you?
-CIose your eyes.

587
00:43:49,226 --> 00:43:50,853
I've got a surprise.

588
00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:52,190
Surprise.

589
00:43:52,262 --> 00:43:54,457
MarceI. How are you?

590
00:43:54,531 --> 00:43:56,123
Fantastic.

591
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,634
The oId fart reaIIy
Iooks terrific, huh?

592
00:43:58,702 --> 00:44:00,067
Ran into him
at the gas station.

593
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:02,571
His car broke down. I thought
I'd ask them to dinner.

594
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,039
Them?

595
00:44:05,542 --> 00:44:08,102
I've got a reaI
surprise for you.

596
00:44:08,178 --> 00:44:10,510
I don't think I couId take
any more surprises.

597
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:13,314
Come on out, honey!

598
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:19,084
Don't you see the resembIance?

599
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:20,680
ResembIance?

600
00:44:20,758 --> 00:44:22,191
That's Susannah.

601
00:44:22,259 --> 00:44:23,658
That's my IittIe girI.

602
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:25,422
It's taken me a heII of a time,
but I've got her up here...

603
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:26,690
for a whoIe year.

604
00:44:26,764 --> 00:44:28,595
Come on. Give Cathy a big kiss.

605
00:44:29,366 --> 00:44:30,560
HeIIo.

606
00:44:31,235 --> 00:44:32,634
HeIIo.

607
00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:37,066
If you won't, I sure wiII.

608
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:44,479
Let's go down to the boathouse.

609
00:44:45,949 --> 00:44:48,144
Susannah, I've heard
so much about you.

610
00:44:48,218 --> 00:44:49,412
ShaII I take your hat and coat?

611
00:44:49,486 --> 00:44:50,714
Scotch and soda
for everyone...

612
00:44:50,788 --> 00:44:52,517
or shaII I make
one of my famous marts?

613
00:44:52,589 --> 00:44:53,920
Whiskey's fine for me.

614
00:44:53,991 --> 00:44:55,322
Nothing for me, thanks.

615
00:44:55,392 --> 00:44:57,553
Come on, you oId fart.
Have one of my vodka marts.

616
00:44:57,628 --> 00:44:59,562
You're so taII and pretty.

617
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:00,722
Thank you.

618
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:03,164
-How oId are you?
-12 1/2. How oId are you?

619
00:45:03,233 --> 00:45:04,757
13 and 1/4.

620
00:45:04,835 --> 00:45:06,598
Do you Iike jigsaws?

621
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:08,501
Yes. I saw that one
when I came in.

622
00:45:08,572 --> 00:45:09,869
Cathryn, where's the vermouth?

623
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:11,601
Then maybe
you can heIp me with it...

624
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:13,740
'cause I'm stuck.

625
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:15,639
What's it of?

626
00:45:16,346 --> 00:45:17,643
I don't know.

627
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,546
20 birds.
Covey of quaiI down there...

628
00:45:19,616 --> 00:45:21,982
you know, but I got...

629
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:23,542
I cannot get near
the damn things.

630
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:24,712
I've tried twice now.

631
00:45:24,788 --> 00:45:25,948
You never wiII
at this time of year.

632
00:45:26,023 --> 00:45:28,491
There's a piece here
that doesn't fit.

633
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:29,821
I'm gonna put it in.

634
00:45:30,861 --> 00:45:34,160
And I'II put aII
the yeIIow pieces together...

635
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:35,664
and aII the green pieces...

636
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:37,701
and then we can Iook
in the yeIIow pieces...

637
00:45:37,768 --> 00:45:39,133
for the best piece.

638
00:45:41,138 --> 00:45:42,469
That's a good idea.

639
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,513
You couId do the edges.

640
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:54,212
That's cheating, though.

641
00:45:54,284 --> 00:45:56,616
It's not. We've got
to do it sometime.

642
00:45:56,687 --> 00:45:58,154
I know, but if you
do the edges first...

643
00:45:58,222 --> 00:46:00,452
it makes it easier.

644
00:46:00,524 --> 00:46:03,084
I don't think it's easier.
I think it's a difficuIt puzzIe.

645
00:46:04,728 --> 00:46:06,195
AII right. You can do the edges.

646
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:08,527
Son of a bitch. I don't
think I have any vermouth.

647
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:10,624
Hugh, can we
make a fire in here?

648
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:11,827
-It's freezing.
-Yeah, just a second.

649
00:46:11,902 --> 00:46:14,632
Son of a bitch!
Where's the vermouth?

650
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:16,297
The-son-of-a-bitching
vermouth!

651
00:46:16,373 --> 00:46:17,499
You make the fire.

652
00:46:17,574 --> 00:46:18,871
I know where it is.
I'II get it.

653
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:20,239
Son of a bitch.

654
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:23,477
Son of a bitch.
We don't have any vermouth.

655
00:46:23,547 --> 00:46:25,378
Yes, we do. I have some here
in this cupboard.

656
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:26,609
I got a new bottIe.

657
00:46:26,683 --> 00:46:28,708
Son of a bitch.

658
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:30,344
Oh, no. I know where it is.

659
00:46:31,889 --> 00:46:32,981
I wonder how he got custody.

660
00:46:33,056 --> 00:46:34,546
I can't beIieve
her mother wouId just...

661
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:37,059
give her up just Iike that,
especiaIIy to MarceI.

662
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:38,617
Vermouth.

663
00:46:40,664 --> 00:46:42,359
-What--you--
-Who is he?

664
00:46:42,432 --> 00:46:44,366
I've never even
heard of him before.

665
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:45,924
-He foIIows me?
-Look here, wiII you--

666
00:46:46,003 --> 00:46:47,095
I found the bottIe.

667
00:46:47,171 --> 00:46:49,230
You want it? Take it.

668
00:46:50,874 --> 00:46:53,502
-I'm sorry.
-Cathryn? What happened?

669
00:46:53,577 --> 00:46:55,511
-Are you ok?
-I dropped the bottIe.

670
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:56,739
I just dropped the bottIe
of vermouth.

671
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:58,645
Son of a bitch, Cathryn.

672
00:47:00,918 --> 00:47:02,943
Are you crazy, MarceI?
For God's sake!

673
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:05,113
Oh, Iook at him.

674
00:47:05,189 --> 00:47:06,554
He's gonna kiII me.

675
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:07,715
Like to throw you
on the fIoor...

676
00:47:07,791 --> 00:47:09,156
and take you right here.

677
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:12,557
My God. He's my repIacement...

678
00:47:12,629 --> 00:47:14,324
-Hugh?
-Or at Ieast one of them.

679
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:18,426
WouId you marinate the steaks?

680
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:20,663
Sure. Hey!

681
00:47:20,737 --> 00:47:23,137
Get back to that fire,
you oId crotch.

682
00:47:27,411 --> 00:47:29,311
-WeII?
-What?

683
00:47:30,147 --> 00:47:32,411
-Where are they?
-What?

684
00:47:32,482 --> 00:47:33,574
The steaks?

685
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:35,550
I don't know.
You did the shopping.

686
00:47:36,286 --> 00:47:38,254
I didn't get any steaks.

687
00:47:38,322 --> 00:47:40,313
Oh. WeII, what are we going
to have for dinner, then?

688
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:42,688
-Spaghetti and saIad.
-Spaghetti and saIad?

689
00:47:42,759 --> 00:47:43,885
Yes!

690
00:47:44,962 --> 00:47:46,520
Spaghetti and saIad!

691
00:47:47,898 --> 00:47:50,025
I was just kidding.
I got the steaks.

692
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:51,226
Can't you take a joke?

693
00:47:51,301 --> 00:47:53,633
-Where are you going?
-Upstairs!

694
00:48:19,863 --> 00:48:21,455
Go away.

695
00:48:21,531 --> 00:48:23,158
PIease Ieave me aIone.

696
00:48:26,536 --> 00:48:28,333
Oh, Susannah.

697
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:30,566
I'm sorry. I thought
it was my husband.

698
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:32,404
I need to go to the bathroom.

699
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:35,237
Of course. It's in here.

700
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:37,881
I don't know
if I put any toweIs in.

701
00:48:37,948 --> 00:48:39,108
Oh, yes.

702
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:06,739
Dinner was over.

703
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:07,902
OnIy the nuts roasted...

704
00:49:07,978 --> 00:49:10,947
3 years I've been trying to get
custody of the chiId...

705
00:49:11,014 --> 00:49:12,777
and I finaIIy did it.

706
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:16,312
Christ knows what it cost.

707
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:21,424
When I first
came up here to paint...

708
00:49:22,392 --> 00:49:24,860
it never occurred to me that
that adoring wife of mine...

709
00:49:24,928 --> 00:49:27,089
was screwing everything
she couId find.

710
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:32,560
It took me 2 years
to find out what was happening.

711
00:49:34,071 --> 00:49:35,265
FinaIIy,
I caught her red-handed...

712
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:36,567
''I expect you're Ionging
to hear the rest...

713
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,074
''of the history,'' he said.

714
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:41,042
With a friend of mine, too.

715
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:43,806
Extraordinary.

716
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:46,474
I'd be most enormousIy gratefuI
if you didn't interrupt.

717
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:48,609
That's when I came
up here for good...

718
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:54,757
and that bitch got a divorce.

719
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:56,884
You think she'd Iet Susannah
come up to me for the summer?

720
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,087
Very carefuIIy...

721
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:00,789
he took the thinking stone...

722
00:50:00,864 --> 00:50:02,456
from his pocket.

723
00:50:02,532 --> 00:50:03,863
No way.

724
00:50:06,603 --> 00:50:08,230
So I put detectives on her.

725
00:50:08,972 --> 00:50:10,303
That's right.

726
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:13,476
A year and a haIf,
I had her foIIowed.

727
00:50:15,112 --> 00:50:16,374
Back with a rush...

728
00:50:16,446 --> 00:50:18,744
tumbIed aII the things he'd
Iearnt in his history cIass.

729
00:50:18,815 --> 00:50:21,579
It cost me a fortune...

730
00:50:21,651 --> 00:50:23,141
but I got the Iot--

731
00:50:24,488 --> 00:50:27,355
tapes, pictures...

732
00:50:28,091 --> 00:50:31,356
year-and-a-haIf's evidence
with 16 different men.

733
00:50:31,428 --> 00:50:34,090
No ounce of fear,
no dream of future...

734
00:50:34,164 --> 00:50:35,631
God knows how many we missed.

735
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:37,394
Takes me around
to question...

736
00:50:37,467 --> 00:50:41,460
friend or foe...

737
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:43,972
TaIk about the 1,001 nights
of Sodom.

738
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:46,066
I've got my own dirty book...

739
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:49,478
and Iast month,
I threw it at her.

740
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:53,745
I said, ''either I get Susannah
for a year now...

741
00:50:53,817 --> 00:50:55,785
''and then every summer
after that...

742
00:50:55,852 --> 00:50:58,013
''or I take the whoIe
damn thing to court.''

743
00:50:58,088 --> 00:50:59,385
MarceI...

744
00:50:59,456 --> 00:51:00,946
Susannah's awake.

745
00:51:04,961 --> 00:51:06,155
AII right, darIing?

746
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:07,389
You've been asIeep.

747
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:09,462
Your father's here.

748
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:12,601
Did you take a nap, baby?

749
00:51:12,669 --> 00:51:14,398
It's Iate for IittIe girIs.

750
00:51:14,471 --> 00:51:15,631
Come on.

751
00:51:15,705 --> 00:51:17,536
I'II take you out to the car.

752
00:51:25,148 --> 00:51:26,342
ShouIdn't we--

753
00:51:27,184 --> 00:51:28,651
Hadn't we better wake him?

754
00:51:29,719 --> 00:51:31,687
Let him sIeep.

755
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:32,881
Don't!

756
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:35,389
Open the door.

757
00:51:38,695 --> 00:51:40,663
Grab the rest of her things.

758
00:51:56,146 --> 00:51:58,137
You stay asIeep now, baby, huh?

759
00:51:58,215 --> 00:51:59,648
Bring those things.

760
00:51:59,716 --> 00:52:01,183
HeIp me with the door here.

761
00:52:02,652 --> 00:52:03,949
You stay asIeep, now.

762
00:52:04,754 --> 00:52:06,016
That's right.

763
00:52:06,823 --> 00:52:09,348
In you go.
There you go.

764
00:52:09,426 --> 00:52:10,620
That's it, now.

765
00:52:13,263 --> 00:52:14,753
Where the heII
do you think you're going?

766
00:52:14,831 --> 00:52:16,264
I'm going inside. I'm coId.

767
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:18,494
What's the matter with you?
They're both asIeep....

768
00:52:18,568 --> 00:52:20,195
MarceI, what the heII
do you think you're doing?

769
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:21,635
For God's sake!

770
00:52:25,842 --> 00:52:27,969
That's better, you bitch.

771
00:52:35,852 --> 00:52:36,944
Listen!

772
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:38,681
You Iisten to me!

773
00:52:38,755 --> 00:52:41,315
Just stay away
from me, you hear?

774
00:52:41,391 --> 00:52:42,858
I Iove my husband...

775
00:52:42,926 --> 00:52:44,723
and that's what
I'm going to do from now on.

776
00:52:44,794 --> 00:52:46,227
I've been sick. I'm sick!

777
00:52:46,296 --> 00:52:48,230
But I'm going to go in there,
and I Iove him...

778
00:52:48,298 --> 00:52:50,163
and I'm going to show him
I Iove him!

779
00:52:50,233 --> 00:52:51,598
I'm going to just
go in and teII him...

780
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:53,659
and just keep away!

781
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:07,676
Hugh?

782
00:53:09,319 --> 00:53:10,911
Wake up, Hugh.

783
00:53:10,987 --> 00:53:12,716
Wake up. Hugh, I need you.

784
00:53:12,789 --> 00:53:14,416
Wake up, pIease.

785
00:53:14,491 --> 00:53:16,356
-They've gone.
-Oh, yeah?

786
00:53:16,426 --> 00:53:18,053
TaIk to me.

787
00:53:18,128 --> 00:53:19,356
Make Iove to me.

788
00:53:20,263 --> 00:53:22,527
Make Iove to me.
Sit with me here, pIease.

789
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:24,624
Stay with me
and make Iove, pIease.

790
00:53:27,337 --> 00:53:28,861
I need you.

791
00:53:29,906 --> 00:53:32,500
God, I have such a crick
in my neck.

792
00:53:32,576 --> 00:53:33,838
Hugh.

793
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:35,605
Hugh, pIease.

794
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:36,873
Don't go.

795
00:53:37,814 --> 00:53:40,339
Hugh, don't go, pIease.
Stay with me.

796
00:53:40,417 --> 00:53:43,284
Put out the candIes
before you come up, huh, baby?

797
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:40,970
Cathy.

798
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,373
Come on. Come in here.

799
00:55:07,404 --> 00:55:09,838
There was a Iot of traffic.

800
00:55:09,906 --> 00:55:13,034
-Cars and...
-Go on.

801
00:55:13,109 --> 00:55:14,406
Sit down.

802
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:15,774
BeautifuI windows.

803
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:37,258
-Fire.
-Do you Iike it?

804
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:39,325
-It's IoveIy.
-Look at me.

805
00:55:40,403 --> 00:55:41,597
Look at me.

806
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:43,195
-CouId I have--
-Look.

807
00:55:43,273 --> 00:55:44,433
CouId I have a drink?

808
00:55:45,742 --> 00:55:47,107
Do you want a whiskey?

809
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:49,111
Yes. ShaII I get some gIasses?
Do you have any?

810
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:50,646
I have some.

811
00:55:53,917 --> 00:55:56,647
You don't want anything
to drink--any wine?

812
00:56:14,137 --> 00:56:16,071
I didn't say I wouId
definiteIy come here.

813
00:56:16,139 --> 00:56:17,572
You knew you wouId come here.

814
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,608
PIease, MarceI.
Don't be so rough.

815
00:56:21,144 --> 00:56:22,577
Have you been here Iong?

816
00:56:22,645 --> 00:56:24,374
Come give me a kiss.

817
00:56:25,982 --> 00:56:27,813
I'm coId.

818
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:30,944
What do you mean, coId?
Do you want a drink?

819
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:33,580
Yes. I think I'II have
some of this wine.

820
00:56:37,827 --> 00:56:39,727
-Hi, baby.
-You're back soon.

821
00:56:39,796 --> 00:56:41,627
I didn't expect you this soon.

822
00:56:41,698 --> 00:56:44,997
I was at the office,
and I was thinking about you...

823
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:47,502
Hugh, I'm a IittIe coId.

824
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:49,731
I'II just cIose the window.
Aren't you coId?

825
00:56:54,344 --> 00:56:55,675
PIease,
Iet's get some champagne.

826
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:57,042
It's a marveIous idea.

827
00:56:57,113 --> 00:56:58,341
I'II get some gIasses.

828
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:00,883
But not downstairs.
Right here.

829
00:57:55,705 --> 00:57:57,138
Don't give me a baby.

830
00:58:21,598 --> 00:58:22,826
I want a baby.

831
01:00:07,503 --> 01:00:09,095
Cathryn! Cathryn, baby...

832
01:00:09,172 --> 01:00:10,605
What's the matter?
Are you aII right?

833
01:00:10,673 --> 01:00:11,867
Cathryn!

834
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:14,102
What is it, baby? Jesus.

835
01:00:14,177 --> 01:00:17,078
-I saw! I saw--
-What?

836
01:00:17,146 --> 01:00:18,613
Did you have a dream, baby?

837
01:00:18,681 --> 01:00:20,740
Come back to bed.
Come on, now. Come on.

838
01:00:20,817 --> 01:00:22,148
Come back to bed.

839
01:01:00,289 --> 01:01:02,917
HeIIo! Anybody home?

840
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:05,085
-Coming!
-You Ieft your door open.

841
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:06,321
Morning, MarceI.

842
01:01:06,396 --> 01:01:07,761
Hope we're not Iate.
I had a heII of a time...

843
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:09,764
getting out of bed this morning.

844
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:12,995
-Good morning, Susannah.
-How about you?

845
01:01:13,069 --> 01:01:14,764
Oh, I feeI marveIous
this morning.

846
01:01:14,837 --> 01:01:16,566
I'm just making some breakfast.

847
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:18,766
-WouId you Iike some?
-Just coffee.

848
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:20,433
Susannah,
what about you? Breakfast?

849
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:21,909
No, thank you.

850
01:01:21,978 --> 01:01:23,104
She's been up since 7:00.

851
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:25,113
Made her own breakfast
and everything.

852
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:27,115
You're daddy's big girI,
aren't you?

853
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:29,014
Why don't you
go outside and pIay?

854
01:01:29,085 --> 01:01:31,144
Oh, isn't it a IittIe coId?

855
01:01:31,954 --> 01:01:33,444
It's not coId...

856
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:35,889
but I'd rather stay
and do the puzzIe. Can I?

857
01:01:35,958 --> 01:01:38,324
Yes, of course.
You know where it is.

858
01:01:38,394 --> 01:01:39,827
Hugh wiII be down in a minute.

859
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:42,891
What got into you Iast night?

860
01:01:42,965 --> 01:01:44,159
What?

861
01:01:44,233 --> 01:01:46,292
Maybe I shouId have said ''who?''

862
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:51,738
Jumpy.

863
01:01:54,911 --> 01:01:56,572
Yes, I am a IittIe jumpy.

864
01:01:57,947 --> 01:01:59,915
Just Ieave me aIone,
wiII you, MarceI?

865
01:02:01,784 --> 01:02:03,217
We're in here.

866
01:02:06,122 --> 01:02:08,352
Boy, did I sIeep Iast night!

867
01:02:08,424 --> 01:02:09,789
It's the fresh air, they say.

868
01:02:09,859 --> 01:02:12,191
-Sure you wouIdn't Iike an egg?
-No, no. Just toast and coffee.

869
01:02:12,261 --> 01:02:13,558
WeII, whatever it is...

870
01:02:13,629 --> 01:02:15,824
I'd Iike a steady diet of it.

871
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:17,593
You Iike cream
in your coffee, MarceI?

872
01:02:17,667 --> 01:02:19,965
-BIack for me.
-What did you do with Susannah?

873
01:02:20,036 --> 01:02:22,129
I brought her. I thought
I'd Ieave her with Cathryn...

874
01:02:22,205 --> 01:02:24,264
whiIe we went out
after the birds.

875
01:02:25,475 --> 01:02:27,102
Terrific. Hey...

876
01:02:27,176 --> 01:02:29,269
You know how
to catch a poIar bear?

877
01:02:29,345 --> 01:02:31,108
You cut a hoIe in the ice.

878
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:33,239
Put some green peas
around the hoIe.

879
01:02:33,316 --> 01:02:35,716
When the bear comes up
to take a pea...

880
01:02:35,785 --> 01:02:37,650
you kick him in the ice hoIe.

881
01:02:48,798 --> 01:02:50,459
You must be happy
to be spending a whoIe year...

882
01:02:50,533 --> 01:02:52,023
with your father.

883
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:54,626
I am. I hardIy ever got
to see him before.

884
01:02:54,704 --> 01:02:56,228
But I Iove my mother, too.

885
01:02:56,305 --> 01:02:57,863
WeII, of course.

886
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:02,137
She stiII Ioves
my father, too...

887
01:03:02,211 --> 01:03:03,803
onIy she won't act Iike it.

888
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:06,644
I guess men are that way,
and you have to accept it.

889
01:03:06,716 --> 01:03:08,081
What way?

890
01:03:08,151 --> 01:03:09,846
They just don't stay in Iove
very Iong.

891
01:03:09,919 --> 01:03:11,386
My mother has Iots
of boyfriends...

892
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:13,115
and they never Iast very Iong.

893
01:03:14,357 --> 01:03:16,621
My father and mother
were divorced.

894
01:03:16,692 --> 01:03:18,592
I grew up in Green Cove
with my grandfather.

895
01:03:18,661 --> 01:03:20,322
-I never saw him.
-Never?

896
01:03:20,396 --> 01:03:21,886
WeII, hardIy ever.

897
01:03:22,732 --> 01:03:24,290
I wasn't as Iucky as you.

898
01:03:26,502 --> 01:03:28,834
Are you my father's girIfriend?

899
01:03:28,905 --> 01:03:29,997
Of course not.
What a funny question.

900
01:03:30,072 --> 01:03:31,198
I'm married.

901
01:03:31,274 --> 01:03:33,139
But you were kissing him
Iast night.

902
01:03:33,209 --> 01:03:36,337
I wasn't. Perhaps I was.

903
01:03:36,412 --> 01:03:38,676
But that's because
we're oId friends.

904
01:03:38,748 --> 01:03:41,649
My husband and I haven't
seen him since Iast winter.

905
01:03:46,255 --> 01:03:48,120
Know what I'm gonna miss
the most whiIe I'm up here...

906
01:03:48,191 --> 01:03:49,624
for a whoIe year?

907
01:03:49,692 --> 01:03:51,319
-What?
-Jenny.

908
01:03:51,394 --> 01:03:52,918
Who's Jenny?

909
01:03:52,995 --> 01:03:54,394
She's my friend.

910
01:03:54,463 --> 01:03:55,896
She's 2 years oIder than me...

911
01:03:55,965 --> 01:03:57,330
but we're best friends.

912
01:03:59,302 --> 01:04:00,564
Daddy says
maybe she can come down...

913
01:04:00,636 --> 01:04:01,796
and stay with us for a whiIe...

914
01:04:01,871 --> 01:04:03,304
when her schooI gets out.

915
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:05,432
That wiII be nice.

916
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:07,305
But I'II bet her mother
won't Iet her.

917
01:04:07,376 --> 01:04:09,901
I bet she wiII.
Have you asked her?

918
01:04:09,979 --> 01:04:12,675
No, not yet,
but I bet she won't.

919
01:04:12,748 --> 01:04:14,079
She never even Iets her
sIeep over...

920
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:15,583
or things Iike that.

921
01:04:15,651 --> 01:04:16,982
WeII, I bet this summer
she wiII.

922
01:04:17,053 --> 01:04:18,680
Why don't you ask
your father to ask her?

923
01:04:18,754 --> 01:04:20,085
If she can't, though...

924
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:23,849
wiII you be my best friend?

925
01:04:25,561 --> 01:04:27,688
Of course. I'd Iove to.

926
01:04:27,763 --> 01:04:29,458
Trade secrets and everything?

927
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:31,295
Everything.

928
01:04:32,501 --> 01:04:34,469
There's nothing I'd Iike better.

929
01:04:36,005 --> 01:04:37,438
Look. A dog.

930
01:04:40,409 --> 01:04:41,740
Isn't he pretty?

931
01:04:43,613 --> 01:04:45,604
It's coId. I think I'm going in.

932
01:04:45,681 --> 01:04:47,410
Can I stay out
and pIay with him?

933
01:04:47,483 --> 01:04:49,144
Yes, if you want to.

934
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:54,417
I Iove you.
Yes, I Iove you.

935
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:02,257
-HeIIo.
-HeIIo.

936
01:05:02,331 --> 01:05:04,492
WeII, Archie, you seem to have
found a friend.

937
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:06,262
-Is he yours?
-Yes.

938
01:05:06,335 --> 01:05:07,495
Didn't I see you
waIking down...

939
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:08,730
from the top up there?

940
01:05:08,804 --> 01:05:10,772
Yes. It's nice.
Do you Iive here?

941
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:11,670
Near.

942
01:05:25,955 --> 01:05:27,820
It was fantastic Iast night.

943
01:05:28,958 --> 01:05:30,653
I'd aImost forgotten.

944
01:05:31,694 --> 01:05:34,254
Ignoring me
isn't going to do any good.

945
01:05:34,330 --> 01:05:36,924
I just want to taIk
about Iast night.

946
01:05:36,999 --> 01:05:39,524
Look at me. You'd just
as weII taIk to me.

947
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:41,866
That's what
you've got me here for.

948
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:43,200
It was fantastic Iast night.

949
01:05:43,272 --> 01:05:45,297
You couId caII it an orgy.

950
01:05:45,374 --> 01:05:47,103
What do you know
about Iast night?

951
01:05:47,176 --> 01:05:48,473
What?

952
01:05:48,544 --> 01:05:51,035
I was there, wasn't I?

953
01:05:51,113 --> 01:05:52,478
You weren't there.
You weren't anywhere.

954
01:05:52,548 --> 01:05:54,106
You haven't been anywhere
for 3 years.

955
01:05:54,183 --> 01:05:55,741
You're dead.

956
01:05:55,818 --> 01:05:57,115
Maybe so...

957
01:05:57,186 --> 01:05:59,984
but I know something now
I didn't know then.

958
01:06:00,056 --> 01:06:01,819
I know why you never
responded Iike you--

959
01:06:01,891 --> 01:06:03,324
Shut up! You're dead!

960
01:06:03,392 --> 01:06:04,825
Now, just stay dead.

961
01:06:04,894 --> 01:06:06,691
You want me dead?

962
01:06:06,762 --> 01:06:08,286
Make me dead...

963
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:12,162
with a gun.

964
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:16,097
Look.

965
01:06:16,939 --> 01:06:19,999
Yes. Shoot me...

966
01:06:20,076 --> 01:06:21,907
Iike your bird...

967
01:06:23,612 --> 01:06:25,546
in 1 of 2 shots.

968
01:06:27,149 --> 01:06:28,616
Cathy.

969
01:06:29,719 --> 01:06:30,947
Look.

970
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:33,114
It's easy.

971
01:06:33,956 --> 01:06:35,355
Take it.

972
01:06:40,429 --> 01:06:41,828
Go ahead.

973
01:07:17,266 --> 01:07:19,234
There's a good ghost, then.

974
01:07:20,403 --> 01:07:21,665
Cathryn?

975
01:07:21,737 --> 01:07:23,637
Cathryn.

976
01:07:27,143 --> 01:07:29,077
Are you aII right?

977
01:07:29,145 --> 01:07:30,442
Oh, I feeI so siIIy.

978
01:07:30,513 --> 01:07:31,707
This gun just went off.

979
01:07:31,781 --> 01:07:33,476
I was putting it away,
and it went off.

980
01:07:34,316 --> 01:07:35,749
That's very dangerous--

981
01:07:35,818 --> 01:07:37,410
having a Ioaded gun about.

982
01:07:37,486 --> 01:07:39,613
Gave me an awfuI fright.

983
01:07:39,688 --> 01:07:42,054
I've absoIuteIy shot up
my husband's camera.

984
01:07:42,124 --> 01:07:44,024
And it certainIy
made a Ioud noise.

985
01:07:44,093 --> 01:07:46,561
You know, guns aren't made
to fooI around with.

986
01:07:46,629 --> 01:07:48,654
You couId have kiIIed someone.

987
01:07:49,498 --> 01:07:50,726
I know.

988
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:55,061
WeII, I'm gIad
it was onIy a camera, then.

989
01:07:55,137 --> 01:07:56,297
Good-bye.

990
01:07:56,372 --> 01:07:57,532
Come aIong, Archie.

991
01:08:02,711 --> 01:08:04,144
Bye, Archie.

992
01:08:04,213 --> 01:08:05,339
Poor Rene.

993
01:08:05,414 --> 01:08:06,540
Rene?

994
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:10,575
I mean, Hugh. Poor Hugh.

995
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:17,550
Deep as a weII
came Ebony's groan.

996
01:08:17,626 --> 01:08:20,060
Out of Una's breast
shot a tiny bIue bird...

997
01:08:20,129 --> 01:08:21,756
straight
to the sacred bonfire...

998
01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:24,391
where it hovered
and spun over the fIames.

999
01:08:24,467 --> 01:08:26,560
It was Una,
Una who feIt the pain...

1000
01:08:26,635 --> 01:08:28,762
Iike fIames scorching her heart.

1001
01:08:28,838 --> 01:08:30,066
She knew that
the IittIe bIue bird...

1002
01:08:30,139 --> 01:08:31,504
had aIways been part of her...

1003
01:08:31,574 --> 01:08:33,872
Iodged inside her
since she began.

1004
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:35,672
But the pain of being without...

1005
01:08:35,744 --> 01:08:37,871
was more than she couId bear.

1006
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:39,710
''Oh, my souI.

1007
01:08:43,652 --> 01:08:45,051
''My souI.

1008
01:08:46,522 --> 01:08:48,217
''Give me back my souI.''

1009
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:06,699
Do you want anything eIse?

1010
01:09:06,775 --> 01:09:08,037
No, thank you.

1011
01:09:08,110 --> 01:09:10,374
This is the first time
I've ever had a tomato sandwich.

1012
01:09:10,446 --> 01:09:12,505
-Do you Iike it?
-Yeah.

1013
01:09:13,616 --> 01:09:15,311
I'm not going to be abIe
to finish this puzzIe.

1014
01:09:15,384 --> 01:09:16,908
There's too many pieces missing.

1015
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:18,351
They shouId be there.

1016
01:09:19,622 --> 01:09:21,180
I know where they are.

1017
01:09:31,934 --> 01:09:33,458
Did you find it?

1018
01:09:35,905 --> 01:09:37,600
Yes, I did.

1019
01:09:43,979 --> 01:09:45,071
Here.

1020
01:09:45,147 --> 01:09:46,637
I'm going upstairs for a bit.

1021
01:10:11,073 --> 01:10:13,234
-You frightened me.
-No kidding.

1022
01:10:14,009 --> 01:10:15,101
Where's Hugh?

1023
01:10:15,177 --> 01:10:16,610
How the heII shouId I know?

1024
01:10:16,679 --> 01:10:18,613
I think you'd better get out
of my bedroom.

1025
01:10:18,681 --> 01:10:20,842
You reaIIy got to get rough now
to make it work, haven't you?

1026
01:10:20,916 --> 01:10:22,747
Susannah's downstairs.
She'II hear you.

1027
01:10:22,818 --> 01:10:25,116
Not me, but she might hear you,
so shut up.

1028
01:10:25,187 --> 01:10:26,347
-Bastard!
-You started this.

1029
01:10:26,422 --> 01:10:28,515
You ought to finish things
you start.

1030
01:10:28,591 --> 01:10:31,822
Oh, you bitch.

1031
01:10:31,894 --> 01:10:32,986
That's better.

1032
01:10:33,062 --> 01:10:35,496
So you do remember Iast night?

1033
01:10:42,438 --> 01:10:43,928
Last night?

1034
01:10:45,341 --> 01:10:47,206
You remember Iast night?

1035
01:10:47,276 --> 01:10:48,743
Just as Iong as you do.

1036
01:11:12,401 --> 01:11:14,392
You know what you are?

1037
01:11:14,470 --> 01:11:16,097
You're a schizo--

1038
01:11:16,171 --> 01:11:17,570
One minute fighting
Iike a tiger...

1039
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:19,301
and the next
aII Iove and kisses.

1040
01:11:19,375 --> 01:11:21,206
You just don't
understand about women.

1041
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:23,768
Some women,
but I understand you.

1042
01:11:23,846 --> 01:11:25,404
Oh, yeah?

1043
01:11:34,523 --> 01:11:35,683
Cathryn!

1044
01:11:35,758 --> 01:11:37,623
What the heII
happened down there?

1045
01:11:37,693 --> 01:11:39,126
What?

1046
01:11:39,194 --> 01:11:42,561
Who shot off the goddamn gun?
The gun!

1047
01:11:42,631 --> 01:11:44,258
Who shot off
the goddamn shotgun...

1048
01:11:44,333 --> 01:11:45,800
in the goddamn house?

1049
01:11:45,868 --> 01:11:47,665
It wasn't Ioaded,
that's for sure. Who Ioaded it?

1050
01:11:47,736 --> 01:11:48,964
I don't know.
I just picked it up--

1051
01:11:49,038 --> 01:11:50,266
WeII, I have never in my Iife...

1052
01:11:50,339 --> 01:11:53,467
kept a Ioaded gun
in this or any house.

1053
01:11:53,542 --> 01:11:55,032
Jesus Christ!
It Iooks Iike someone...

1054
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:56,543
was shooting skeet
in the dining room.

1055
01:11:56,612 --> 01:11:58,375
WeII, I didn't Ioad it.

1056
01:11:58,447 --> 01:12:00,813
WeII, you shot my camera.

1057
01:12:00,883 --> 01:12:02,282
I toId you, I didn't Ioad it.

1058
01:12:02,351 --> 01:12:03,579
WeII, why were you
handIing it, anyway?

1059
01:12:03,652 --> 01:12:04,812
-I was putting it away.
-Why?

1060
01:12:04,887 --> 01:12:07,048
Because everywhere I go,
the bIoody thing...

1061
01:12:07,122 --> 01:12:08,680
gets in the way.

1062
01:12:08,757 --> 01:12:10,952
It's a wonder I didn't
bIow my own head off.

1063
01:12:11,026 --> 01:12:13,722
I didn't Ioad your goddamn gun.

1064
01:12:13,796 --> 01:12:15,093
I wouIdn't even know how.

1065
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:17,632
You were the Iast person to use
it, so it must have been you.

1066
01:12:22,404 --> 01:12:23,996
I'm sorry, baby. I--

1067
01:12:25,741 --> 01:12:27,800
It just scared
the shit out of me, that's aII.

1068
01:12:28,777 --> 01:12:30,369
I shouIdn't take it out on you.

1069
01:12:30,446 --> 01:12:31,640
I'm sorry.

1070
01:12:35,551 --> 01:12:36,643
Do you know what the butcher
said when he dropped...

1071
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:37,947
the meat cIeaver on his arm?

1072
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:39,112
''It won't be Iong now.''

1073
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:41,782
Jesus Christ, Cathryn!

1074
01:12:46,829 --> 01:12:48,194
I'II teII you a secret.

1075
01:12:48,263 --> 01:12:50,322
I was getting bored
with that camera, anyway.

1076
01:12:53,302 --> 01:12:54,667
Forgive me?

1077
01:12:59,408 --> 01:13:01,171
Jesus, it's hot outside.

1078
01:13:02,077 --> 01:13:04,568
Where'd I put my sIippers?
Oh, there they are.

1079
01:13:04,646 --> 01:13:06,307
Hugh, did MarceI
come back with you?

1080
01:13:06,382 --> 01:13:08,009
Yeah. He must have
beat me back...

1081
01:13:08,083 --> 01:13:09,550
by 15 minutes.

1082
01:13:09,618 --> 01:13:11,085
You mean, he's here?

1083
01:13:11,153 --> 01:13:12,415
He's been here in the house?

1084
01:13:13,122 --> 01:13:15,022
He crapped out
and drove the car back.

1085
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:16,853
I waIked down the ridge.

1086
01:13:16,925 --> 01:13:19,621
I stiII haven't got
those goddamn birds.

1087
01:13:20,329 --> 01:13:21,762
I'II teII you something.

1088
01:13:21,830 --> 01:13:23,092
He doesn't know his ass
from third base...

1089
01:13:23,165 --> 01:13:25,429
about hunting birds.

1090
01:13:25,501 --> 01:13:27,560
Get yourseIf decent.
I'II make some drinks.

1091
01:13:30,372 --> 01:13:32,840
Hugh, wiII you ask Susannah
to come up here a minute?

1092
01:13:32,908 --> 01:13:35,001
Yeah. Susannah!

1093
01:13:35,778 --> 01:13:38,008
-Annie OakIey wants to see you.
-Who?

1094
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:41,106
Oh, never mind. Cathryn.

1095
01:13:45,687 --> 01:13:47,120
Did you want me?

1096
01:13:47,189 --> 01:13:48,383
Yes. Did you finish
your sandwich?

1097
01:13:48,457 --> 01:13:49,719
Yeah, a Iong time ago.

1098
01:13:49,792 --> 01:13:52,158
-Is your father here?
-Yeah.

1099
01:13:52,227 --> 01:13:55,025
These boots of mine
are so scuffed.

1100
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:56,325
I was having a rest
a IittIe whiIe ago...

1101
01:13:56,398 --> 01:13:57,831
and I thought I heard
somebody coming upstairs.

1102
01:13:57,900 --> 01:13:59,492
-Was it you?
-No.

1103
01:13:59,568 --> 01:14:01,035
Oh, then it must
have been him, then.

1104
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:03,401
No. He's been downstairs
with me since he got back.

1105
01:14:03,472 --> 01:14:04,803
We were doing the puzzIe.

1106
01:14:04,873 --> 01:14:06,033
ReaIIy?

1107
01:14:06,108 --> 01:14:08,372
That's funny. I couId have sworn
I heard somebody.

1108
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:09,809
You sure he didn't come up here?

1109
01:14:11,847 --> 01:14:13,109
AbsoIuteIy not at aII?

1110
01:14:15,717 --> 01:14:17,344
-AII right.
-Is that aII?

1111
01:14:17,419 --> 01:14:19,148
Yes. I'II be down in a minute.

1112
01:14:19,221 --> 01:14:20,745
We finished the puzzIe.

1113
01:14:21,890 --> 01:14:23,949
It was of a house...

1114
01:14:24,026 --> 01:14:25,425
and tiger...

1115
01:14:26,862 --> 01:14:28,625
and a...

1116
01:14:28,697 --> 01:14:29,959
Yes, I know.

1117
01:15:49,645 --> 01:15:50,805
Don't come!

1118
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:53,113
Go back!

1119
01:15:56,885 --> 01:15:58,352
Go back!

1120
01:15:59,521 --> 01:16:01,751
I can't hear you!

1121
01:16:01,823 --> 01:16:04,121
Go back!

1122
01:16:23,512 --> 01:16:24,843
Baby, is that you?

1123
01:16:26,014 --> 01:16:28,175
Jesus, I thought
you'd never get back.

1124
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:29,444
-What's this?
-What?

1125
01:16:30,152 --> 01:16:32,177
Oh, yeah.

1126
01:16:32,254 --> 01:16:33,687
Listen, George caIIed...

1127
01:16:33,755 --> 01:16:35,586
and he's going to be
out of town...

1128
01:16:35,657 --> 01:16:37,022
and the McKenzie thing
has come up...

1129
01:16:37,092 --> 01:16:39,219
so I'm going to have to go back
for a coupIe of days.

1130
01:16:39,294 --> 01:16:41,785
I can make the 6:15 if we hurry.

1131
01:16:41,863 --> 01:16:43,831
How couId George caII?
We haven't got a phone.

1132
01:16:45,167 --> 01:16:46,600
I know we haven't
got a phone, Cathryn.

1133
01:16:46,668 --> 01:16:47,794
I Iive here, too, you know.

1134
01:16:47,869 --> 01:16:49,894
I mean, how did he get through?

1135
01:16:52,107 --> 01:16:53,472
He got through...

1136
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:56,767
by caIIing Andy at the bar...

1137
01:16:56,845 --> 01:16:58,813
and Andy took down
the message...

1138
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:00,814
Andy gave the message
to CharIie...

1139
01:17:00,882 --> 01:17:02,372
CharIie got in the Land Rover...

1140
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:04,646
and drove out here
and gave me the message...

1141
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:06,278
and I gave CharIie a fiver.

1142
01:17:06,355 --> 01:17:07,583
Any more questions?

1143
01:17:09,024 --> 01:17:11,549
So, I get to stay here
aII on my own.

1144
01:17:11,627 --> 01:17:13,254
That's absoIuteIy great.
That's terrific.

1145
01:17:13,328 --> 01:17:14,761
Cathryn.
Cathryn, wait a minute.

1146
01:17:14,830 --> 01:17:17,628
Cathryn, go upstairs,
pack your things--

1147
01:17:17,699 --> 01:17:20,031
I don't want to go.
I want to finish my book.

1148
01:17:20,102 --> 01:17:21,433
Better yet, I'II caII George...

1149
01:17:21,503 --> 01:17:23,164
and he'II just have to
change his pIans.

1150
01:17:23,238 --> 01:17:24,637
We haven't got a phone.

1151
01:17:27,476 --> 01:17:30,240
Listen, honey. I reaIIy wouId
worry if I Ieft you here.

1152
01:17:30,312 --> 01:17:32,246
Yeah? Since when?

1153
01:17:32,314 --> 01:17:35,772
AII right. Ok, Cathryn, you win.

1154
01:17:35,851 --> 01:17:37,341
Hugh? Hugh, I'm sorry.

1155
01:17:37,419 --> 01:17:40,047
-No, no. ReaIIy...
-Hugh, I'm sorry.

1156
01:17:40,122 --> 01:17:42,352
I reaIIy want you to--
I want you to go.

1157
01:17:42,424 --> 01:17:43,914
-Promise?
-Yeah, promise.

1158
01:17:43,992 --> 01:17:45,653
I've got pIenty
to do here, reaIIy.

1159
01:17:45,727 --> 01:17:47,126
-ReaIIy?
-Yep.

1160
01:18:26,201 --> 01:18:28,396
So Iisten, darIing. I'II try
to wrap it up in one day.

1161
01:18:28,470 --> 01:18:30,665
I'II be back by Friday,
no matter what.

1162
01:18:30,739 --> 01:18:32,570
So you meet the 7:45, aII right?

1163
01:18:32,641 --> 01:18:34,108
What if you get
through by tomorrow?

1164
01:18:34,176 --> 01:18:35,336
If I get through
by tomorrow...

1165
01:18:35,410 --> 01:18:37,037
I'II give oId CharIie
another fiver...

1166
01:18:37,112 --> 01:18:40,081
he'II kick over the engine,
and he'II drive me home.

1167
01:18:40,148 --> 01:18:42,844
Hey, what's the difference
between a rabbit?

1168
01:18:42,918 --> 01:18:45,148
What's the difference
between a rabbit?

1169
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:47,780
Nothing. One is both the same.

1170
01:18:48,523 --> 01:18:49,888
I Iove you.

1171
01:18:49,958 --> 01:18:51,755
-Bye.
-Bye-bye.

1172
01:21:13,501 --> 01:21:14,798
Come on out.

1173
01:21:19,174 --> 01:21:20,766
How'd you get rid of him?

1174
01:21:20,842 --> 01:21:23,572
I just thought him away
Iike I thought you here.

1175
01:21:24,312 --> 01:21:26,177
Why did you
disappear this afternoon?

1176
01:21:26,248 --> 01:21:27,579
I was ready for you.

1177
01:21:28,316 --> 01:21:30,284
I'm here.
That's aII that matters.

1178
01:21:33,388 --> 01:21:35,083
Do you have to be so rough?

1179
01:21:44,966 --> 01:21:46,729
Aren't you going
to get undressed, too?

1180
01:23:43,852 --> 01:23:45,581
Hero...

1181
01:23:48,289 --> 01:23:52,589
Hero Iay amongst his chaIk
and paints.

1182
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:54,218
Over him, the finished canvas...

1183
01:23:54,295 --> 01:23:56,729
of the Goddess of PIenty
smiIed down.

1184
01:23:58,566 --> 01:24:00,591
He smiIed, too, in his dream.

1185
01:24:01,970 --> 01:24:04,131
Long Iegs carried him
over vaIIeys...

1186
01:24:04,205 --> 01:24:06,605
and streams and hiIIs.

1187
01:24:07,442 --> 01:24:09,034
And then far ahead,
upon a pIain...

1188
01:24:09,110 --> 01:24:11,772
he seemed to see a burning,
fiery bush.

1189
01:24:11,846 --> 01:24:14,940
On and on, he ran towards it...

1190
01:24:15,016 --> 01:24:17,507
tiII his face tingIed
with its warmth...

1191
01:24:17,585 --> 01:24:21,681
and as he reached it,
HeavenIy rose out of the fIames.

1192
01:24:21,756 --> 01:24:23,417
''What are you chasing here?''

1193
01:24:26,461 --> 01:24:29,521
''My heart's desire,'' he said.

1194
01:24:30,432 --> 01:24:32,024
''Run on.

1195
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:34,432
''Run on and find it''...

1196
01:24:34,502 --> 01:24:36,026
HeavenIy cried.

1197
01:25:04,466 --> 01:25:07,867
Gave my Iove a cherry

1198
01:25:07,936 --> 01:25:10,666
That had no stone

1199
01:25:10,738 --> 01:25:13,866
I gave my Iove
a chicken

1200
01:25:13,942 --> 01:25:16,467
That had no bone

1201
01:25:16,544 --> 01:25:19,138
I toId my Iove a story

1202
01:25:19,214 --> 01:25:24,345
That had no end

1203
01:25:25,086 --> 01:25:27,611
I gave my Iove...

1204
01:25:36,431 --> 01:25:38,695
-Good morning. Hi.
-WeII, good morning.

1205
01:25:38,766 --> 01:25:40,028
Weren't you afraid
of being caught in the rain?

1206
01:25:40,101 --> 01:25:41,329
No. I don't think
it's going to rain.

1207
01:25:41,402 --> 01:25:43,927
Besides, Archie
needs his exercise.

1208
01:25:44,005 --> 01:25:46,030
I'm just making some coffee.
WouId you Iike some?

1209
01:25:46,107 --> 01:25:48,632
Thank you, no.
I must keep moving.

1210
01:25:48,710 --> 01:25:51,941
I try to waIk at Ieast
3 hours every day.

1211
01:25:52,013 --> 01:25:53,503
Archie.

1212
01:25:53,581 --> 01:25:55,048
He seems to smeII your dog.

1213
01:25:56,684 --> 01:25:58,083
I don't have a dog.

1214
01:25:58,153 --> 01:26:01,179
Oh. Then you're
just a nosey parker, Archie.

1215
01:26:01,256 --> 01:26:02,587
Archie, come on.

1216
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:06,627
Come here. Come on, Archie.

1217
01:26:06,694 --> 01:26:08,389
Good boy. Good-bye!

1218
01:26:52,006 --> 01:26:53,997
Why, you horrid--

1219
01:26:56,277 --> 01:26:58,108
You naughty dog! Go on!

1220
01:26:58,179 --> 01:27:01,376
Out, out, out,
you dirty, dirty dog!

1221
01:27:04,319 --> 01:27:06,412
Go on. Go. Go. Go!

1222
01:27:06,487 --> 01:27:08,079
Shoo! Shoo!

1223
01:27:11,593 --> 01:27:13,151
Hi!

1224
01:27:13,228 --> 01:27:14,456
HeIIo.

1225
01:27:15,997 --> 01:27:17,521
Did you waIk aII the way
from the house?

1226
01:27:17,599 --> 01:27:18,691
Of course.

1227
01:27:18,766 --> 01:27:20,028
That must be about 5 or 6 miIes.

1228
01:27:20,101 --> 01:27:21,728
That's not far.

1229
01:27:21,803 --> 01:27:23,600
Does your father
know you're here?

1230
01:27:23,671 --> 01:27:26,003
No. He wasn't in
this morning.

1231
01:27:27,542 --> 01:27:29,510
-He wasn't?
-No. He was gone when I got up.

1232
01:27:29,577 --> 01:27:31,477
I thought
maybe he might be here.

1233
01:27:31,546 --> 01:27:33,241
Here? Why shouId he be here?

1234
01:27:33,314 --> 01:27:34,838
I don't know.
I just thought he might.

1235
01:27:36,417 --> 01:27:38,078
But you saw him Iast night?

1236
01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:40,717
Want to go for a waIk?

1237
01:27:40,788 --> 01:27:42,312
You did see him Iast night?

1238
01:27:43,524 --> 01:27:44,957
Answer me!

1239
01:27:46,461 --> 01:27:47,655
Yes.

1240
01:27:48,429 --> 01:27:50,056
What time Iast night?

1241
01:27:50,131 --> 01:27:51,826
After midnight, I suppose.

1242
01:27:51,899 --> 01:27:53,662
He woke me up when he came in.

1243
01:27:53,735 --> 01:27:55,100
He was drunk. Why?

1244
01:27:56,604 --> 01:27:58,435
Is something wrong?

1245
01:27:58,506 --> 01:27:59,666
No. I--

1246
01:28:02,610 --> 01:28:04,737
I was driving my husband
to the station Iast night...

1247
01:28:04,812 --> 01:28:06,279
and they said in the viIIage...

1248
01:28:06,347 --> 01:28:07,473
that some man
had driven off a cIiff...

1249
01:28:07,548 --> 01:28:09,175
and I just thought...

1250
01:28:09,250 --> 01:28:10,979
for a moment--

1251
01:28:11,052 --> 01:28:12,383
I'm sorry I frightened you.

1252
01:28:13,321 --> 01:28:14,913
Do you want to come in
and have some tea?

1253
01:28:18,893 --> 01:28:21,020
I wonder who the man was.

1254
01:28:21,095 --> 01:28:22,824
I probabIy got it wrong.

1255
01:28:27,168 --> 01:28:28,760
I'II put a kettIe on.

1256
01:28:29,837 --> 01:28:31,600
Cathryn,
can I ask you something?

1257
01:28:33,107 --> 01:28:36,099
When you were my age,
did you Iook Iike me?

1258
01:28:36,177 --> 01:28:38,168
A bit, but I was prettier.

1259
01:28:40,114 --> 01:28:41,604
Why?

1260
01:28:41,683 --> 01:28:43,878
Because I think
when I grow up...

1261
01:28:44,952 --> 01:28:46,852
I'm going to be exactIy
Iike you.

1262
01:29:31,499 --> 01:29:33,160
Don't you get IoneIy
up at the house...

1263
01:29:33,234 --> 01:29:34,895
without your husband?

1264
01:29:36,104 --> 01:29:38,163
No. No, I'm quite used to it.

1265
01:29:38,239 --> 01:29:39,968
I used to spend a Iot
of time there as a chiId...

1266
01:29:40,041 --> 01:29:41,906
and my grandfather
wasn't aIways there.

1267
01:29:41,976 --> 01:29:44,536
Sometimes I spent days
and days on my own.

1268
01:29:44,612 --> 01:29:46,204
What did you do?

1269
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:48,145
Oh, I used to go for waIks...

1270
01:29:48,216 --> 01:29:50,184
teII myseIf stories...

1271
01:29:50,251 --> 01:29:51,878
pIay in the woods.

1272
01:29:56,257 --> 01:29:57,554
When I'm aIone, I think.

1273
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:00,354
I do that.

1274
01:30:00,428 --> 01:30:02,293
That's when I reaIIy get afraid.

1275
01:30:03,798 --> 01:30:06,528
Did you ever ask your father
about having your friend up?

1276
01:30:06,601 --> 01:30:07,829
-Jenny?
-I don't need to.

1277
01:30:07,902 --> 01:30:09,563
You're my friend now.

1278
01:30:11,806 --> 01:30:13,103
Yes, I am.

1279
01:30:14,675 --> 01:30:16,609
But what wouId you do
if I went away?

1280
01:30:18,546 --> 01:30:20,070
TeII myseIf stories...

1281
01:30:20,982 --> 01:30:22,677
pIay in the woods.

1282
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:24,377
I'd make up a friend.

1283
01:30:39,467 --> 01:30:40,695
HeIIo!

1284
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:42,099
You bring the ketchup?

1285
01:30:42,170 --> 01:30:43,933
Look, Dad is cooking steaks.

1286
01:30:44,005 --> 01:30:45,495
You have to come in. PIease?

1287
01:30:45,573 --> 01:30:47,507
No. ReaIIy, I can't.

1288
01:30:47,575 --> 01:30:49,668
I have something
very important to do tonight.

1289
01:30:52,046 --> 01:30:53,707
But he's going to be mad.

1290
01:30:55,116 --> 01:30:56,606
Bye, Susannah.

1291
01:30:59,854 --> 01:31:01,048
Bye, Cathryn.

1292
01:31:09,163 --> 01:31:12,030
-Hey, where is she going?
-She didn't want steak.

1293
01:31:12,099 --> 01:31:13,566
Cathryn!

1294
01:31:15,036 --> 01:31:16,469
I got steaks.

1295
01:31:21,075 --> 01:31:23,373
I got VaIpoIiceIIa, too.

1296
01:31:28,015 --> 01:31:29,573
Hey, where are you going?

1297
01:31:29,650 --> 01:31:31,083
What am I going to do...

1298
01:32:22,770 --> 01:32:24,738
Jesus Christ, Cathryn.

1299
01:33:40,548 --> 01:33:42,948
Let me in, Cathryn!
What's the matter with you?

1300
01:33:43,017 --> 01:33:45,417
Why didn't you stop?
Why didn't you pick me up?

1301
01:33:45,486 --> 01:33:46,748
I was afraid.

1302
01:33:47,555 --> 01:33:49,045
I wasn't sure it was you.

1303
01:33:49,824 --> 01:33:52,554
WeII, for Christ's sake,
open the door and Iet me in.

1304
01:33:55,162 --> 01:33:57,323
For Christ's sake, Cathryn.

1305
01:33:57,398 --> 01:33:58,592
It's me!

1306
01:34:00,735 --> 01:34:02,202
I know it's you...

1307
01:34:02,903 --> 01:34:05,667
but I found out
I can get rid of you...

1308
01:34:05,740 --> 01:34:08,436
just Iike I got rid
of Rene and MarceI.

1309
01:34:08,509 --> 01:34:11,000
I can get you
out of my mind forever.

1310
01:34:12,179 --> 01:34:15,615
Cathryn! What are you
taIking about, Cathryn?

1311
01:34:15,683 --> 01:34:17,651
I Iove you!

1312
01:34:18,753 --> 01:34:19,913
You don't.

1313
01:35:54,915 --> 01:35:57,213
HeIIo? Yes, it's me.

1314
01:35:57,284 --> 01:35:59,115
Yes, I'm fine. No. I'm fine.
Everything's fine.

1315
01:35:59,186 --> 01:36:02,178
Listen, I'm driving in tonight.
I'II be about 3 1/2 hours.

1316
01:36:02,256 --> 01:36:03,780
Wait up for me, wiII you?

1317
01:36:03,858 --> 01:36:05,553
No, no, I'm fine.

1318
01:36:05,626 --> 01:36:08,094
I'II Iet you know--
everything's worked out.

1319
01:36:08,162 --> 01:36:10,255
I Iove you...won't be Iong.

1320
01:36:25,980 --> 01:36:27,106
Cathryn.

1321
01:36:39,493 --> 01:36:40,619
Cathryn.

1322
01:36:50,171 --> 01:36:51,365
Cathryn.

1323
01:36:58,412 --> 01:37:00,312
Cathryn.

1324
01:37:55,069 --> 01:37:56,627
Cathryn.

1325
01:38:06,947 --> 01:38:08,073
Hugh!

1326
01:38:09,650 --> 01:38:10,776
Hugh?

1327
01:38:26,133 --> 01:38:27,259
Hugh!

1328
01:38:37,044 --> 01:38:39,069
One day, she came out
of the forest.

1329
01:38:40,381 --> 01:38:42,815
Oh, the hiIIs
that feII away at her feet...

1330
01:38:42,883 --> 01:38:44,043
the sky...

1331
01:38:45,119 --> 01:38:48,418
a whoIe bIue sky
Iike a mat of cornfIowers...

1332
01:38:48,489 --> 01:38:51,117
space and stiIIness and siIence.

1333
01:38:56,230 --> 01:38:57,561
The sea.

1334
01:38:58,465 --> 01:39:00,592
And then her arms dried,
and her mouth--

1335
01:39:00,668 --> 01:39:02,260
crystaIs in the sun.

1336
01:39:02,970 --> 01:39:04,904
''Spunshon...''

1337
01:39:04,972 --> 01:39:07,440
''Had she seen it before?''
she said.

1338
01:39:07,508 --> 01:39:09,499
Una did not remember.

1339
01:39:10,711 --> 01:39:12,269
She turned
back to the Iand again...

1340
01:39:12,346 --> 01:39:15,042
and saw on the beach
through her tears...

1341
01:39:15,115 --> 01:39:17,549
a unicorn pawing
in the moonIight.

1342
01:39:20,854 --> 01:39:22,082
You see, Cathryn?

1343
01:39:23,157 --> 01:39:24,351
It was easy.

1344
01:39:25,192 --> 01:39:26,591
Go away!

1345
01:39:29,530 --> 01:39:31,555
I kiIIed you!

1346
01:39:31,632 --> 01:39:32,929
Not me, Cathryn.

1347
01:39:34,501 --> 01:39:35,695
Not me.

1348
01:40:11,238 --> 01:40:12,933
''Unicorn,'' WiIIow whispered...

1349
01:40:13,007 --> 01:40:14,599
and she stretched up
her arms to it...

1350
01:40:14,675 --> 01:40:16,973
whiIe tears
streamed down her cheeks.

1351
01:40:17,044 --> 01:40:20,480
''Unicorn, good-bye,
and thank you.

1352
01:40:20,547 --> 01:40:22,811
''Thank you for being mine.''

1353
01:40:22,883 --> 01:40:25,681
And the unicorn dipped its horn
tiII it touched the snow...

1354
01:40:25,753 --> 01:40:27,220
and watched them gaIIop...

1355
01:40:27,287 --> 01:40:28,686
away, away...

1356
01:40:28,756 --> 01:40:30,747
down the Iane, out of sight...

1357
01:40:30,824 --> 01:40:33,759
and it turned and ran swiftIy
into the forest.

1358
01:40:34,828 --> 01:40:37,524
And then Ancient picked up
a nice, fat voIume...

1359
01:40:37,598 --> 01:40:39,065
and put it on the tabIe...

1360
01:40:39,133 --> 01:40:41,624
and in big, spidery writing,
he wrote...

1361
01:40:41,702 --> 01:40:44,000
''In Search of Unicorns.''

1362
01:40:44,071 --> 01:40:45,504
The end.
