1
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:56,181
- This is Northwest Mosul.

2
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,809
- These are people
fleeing from ISIS.

3
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:21,039
- My family, my teammates,
we are in Northwest Mosul.

4
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,375
To help in a conflict situation.

5
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,799
Iraqi Army is there fighting ISIS.

6
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:40,850
Three streets over,

7
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,311
ISIS is killing everybody
across the main highway.

8
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:49,359
Against a far wall,
there were living people.

9
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,576
Everybody's thinking the same thing.

10
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:03,498
You go near that little girl, you're dead.

11
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:09,003
Taking a step will very
likely cost you everything.

12
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,800
Within the last 24 years,

13
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,470
everything we've done culminates here,

14
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,305
right in one place.

15
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,435
Because I'm trying to save this little girl.

16
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:28,606
Whoever wants to go, go.

17
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,484
Jesus helped me.

18
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,725
- Eubank formed
the group 20 years ago

19
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:05,602
but expanded his teams to operate

20
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:08,605
in places like Sudan and Iraq.

21
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:10,315
- While
hundreds of thousands fled,

22
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:13,193
an American and his family moved in.

23
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,903
- To help victims that are caught on

24
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,780
the front lines of the war on terror.

25
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,073
- His wife and three children

26
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:23,328
have joined him on all his
missions to war torn areas.

27
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:27,498
The family is taking a break
this week in Washington state.

28
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:28,583
- We'll be in the country

29
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,668
for at least a month, maybe more.

30
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:33,296
- But all
plan to go back to Iraq.

31
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:36,216
- Your story's moving
viewers around the world.

32
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,175
- The Eubank family ...

33
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,260
it seems crazy what are they doing.

34
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,471
- Well as a reporter from the outside,
I agree.

35
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,181
But as I spent time with them
on the front lines,

36
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,558
it felt surprisingly normal.

37
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:51,856
- One definition of adventure is

38
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,358
you don't know what's gonna happen.

39
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:55,318
You don't know.

40
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:07,747
Everywhere, every person
in the world has something

41
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,832
good and wonderful that we can love,

42
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:11,501
learn from and build up.

43
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,211
And stand together against evil.

44
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:15,046
And help people who are oppressed.

45
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,547
I want that story to be told.

46
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:33,815
I was born in Texas.

47
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,400
Always a Texan.

48
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,694
But I grew up as a
missionary kid in Thailand.

49
00:04:39,278 --> 00:04:41,489
As a missionary kid, I remember thinking,

50
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:43,783
I think I'm more of a soldier.

51
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,660
I'm more of that action guy.

52
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,079
I'm not sure if I'll be a missionary.

53
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,164
And I went to Texas A&M University,

54
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:52,000
where I was in the the Corps of Cadets.

55
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,420
I then became a US Army officer
as scout platoon leader,

56
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,380
and then 2nd Ranger Battalion,

57
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,716
and then after that 1st
Special Forces Group.

58
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:02,844
But after ten years,

59
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:05,471
I felt God had something
else for me to do.

60
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:08,808
And so, I decided to
get out of the military.

61
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,184
Serve as a missionary.

62
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:13,563
And in the middle of that, I met Karen.

63
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,907
- When we first met I was amazed.

64
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,367
No, I wasn't amazed .

65
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,622
- And I asked her out and she said no.

66
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:34,334
But she agreed later to go climbing.

67
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,960
And I took her on some technically climbs

68
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,795
in Washington State.

69
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:40,256
And she summited, which is not easy.

70
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:43,092
I said, "God let me marry
this woman, I'll do anything."

71
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,096
- Climbing was something
I'd never done before.

72
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:51,851
And he was strong and committed

73
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,437
and had the goal of us all summiting.

74
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,566
And I had no idea even
what that meant, summiting.

75
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:04,739
- We did it.

76
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,033
- We're on the summit of Mt. Rainier,

77
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,369
by the grace of God and good friends.

78
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,203
Awesome!

79
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,079
Free Burma!

80
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:11,913
- Rangers!

81
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,377
Going back down he asked me,

82
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:19,587
"Do you wanna do this again?"

83
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,881
And I was a bit resistant, 'cause again,

84
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:25,134
I wasn't sure about a
relationship at that point.

85
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:31,808
- In March 1993, I got a call
from my dad, a missionary.

86
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,646
- An ethnic general inside of Burma,

87
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,147
came and contacted me and said,

88
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:39,315
"We've heard about your son,

89
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:42,360
he's a soldier, were
soldiers, and we want help."

90
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:46,030
- And says "Dave you gotta pray,
are you gonna come or not?"

91
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,658
And I said, I prayed
right on the spot, yes.

92
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:51,285
And I turned to Karen and
said I'm going to Burma.

93
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:52,912
Will you come with me?

94
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,539
Will you marry me?

95
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,499
- I felt in my heart,

96
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,042
say no and let it go,

97
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:00,628
or you say yes and you get in.

98
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:01,963
- Its not often that we think of a

99
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,840
combination of a missionary and a soldier.

100
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,800
And that became a conflict.

101
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:09,387
But he has to listen
to what God tells him.

102
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,056
And now you can kiss the bride.

103
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,145
- Karen and I got married.

104
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:20,356
And starting our mission on into Burma,

105
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:22,150
that was our honeymoon.

106
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:32,952
- Over fifty years of
civil war have left Burma

107
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,496
one of the poorest countries in the world.

108
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:38,708
The military dictatorship
attacks its own people.

109
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:44,255
Pro-democracy Burmese and ethnic groups

110
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:46,090
try to protect their people,

111
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:49,093
and resist the attacks of the Burma Army.

112
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:57,185
- The country is about 60%
Burman majority people,

113
00:07:57,185 --> 00:08:00,480
who live in the central
plains of Burma, mostly.

114
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,232
But then in the mountains,
there are the ethnic people,

115
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:05,443
which make up about 40% of Burma.

116
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:08,738
Back in 1997, I saw people running across

117
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,072
the border of Burma to Thailand.

118
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:11,699
It was 10,000 people on a road,

119
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,159
just running for their lives.

120
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:21,626
- We heard there might even
be a genocide going on.

121
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:25,504
And it was the government's
policy to keep it isolated.

122
00:08:25,504 --> 00:08:28,299
And yet we knew we had to go and respond.

123
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,177
- My wife and I prayed.

124
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,679
I loaded the truck up with
four backpacks of medicine,

125
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,598
and like a 100 bucks in my pocket,

126
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,350
and I drove to the border.

127
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,936
And thought well, I'll
help one person at least,

128
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,187
and they'll be glad and I'll be glad,

129
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,939
and I'll have no other plan. Just go.

130
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,190
Go to the sound of guns.

131
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,816
Go to the sound of need.

132
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:49,237
And trust God to show you
how you can be useful.

133
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,808
- I'm going forward down the road.

134
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:19,767
And there was people fleeing,

135
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,686
and they're carrying all
their worldly possessions.

136
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,938
Basket on their back with
pots and pans and food.

137
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:26,148
Kids on their shoulders,
kids in their arms.

138
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:30,152
And behind them you hear,
"Boom Boom Bam Bam Bam Bam".

139
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,030
As their villages burned behind them.

140
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:39,161
And out of the jungle
steps a man from Burma.

141
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:42,707
He's wearing full fatigues
with hand grenades, M16, earring.

142
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,552
- And he said, "Hello, my name is, Eliya."

143
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:55,428
I'm a medic.

144
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:02,435
- And I said, "You look like a
pirate, like a pirate angel."

145
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,561
An answer to prayer.

146
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,816
- He picked four guys out and

147
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,443
they came and picked up
the backpacks of medicine.

148
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:13,237
And we all went together, and
started treating patients.

149
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,489
And we could organize quickly

150
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:17,783
because there's only a
handful of us. And we could just go.

151
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:45,061
- And I held IV bags and
we were the helpers to him.

152
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:48,939
Gunshot by Burma soldiers.

153
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:52,610
Successful removal of the bullet by Eliya.

154
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,695
We treated over a
thousand people that week.

155
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:55,529
Eliya did.

156
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,116
When we first started,

157
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:00,576
it was just a few people together.

158
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,328
As we did these relief missions,

159
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,663
more and more ethnic
people began to join us.

160
00:11:04,663 --> 00:11:07,792
And we became a 10 - 20 person group.

161
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,879
After a few years, different
ethnic leaders came to us

162
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,964
and said, "We really like your teams."

163
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:16,258
"Can you make teams for us like that?"

164
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:19,053
"If we give you people to
train, will you train them?"

165
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:22,390
We prayed, and said, "Okay we will."

166
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:26,519
We wanted freedom.

167
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,978
We're in Burma.

168
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:30,147
And Rangers had meant a lot to me

169
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:32,108
when I was an U.S. Army Ranger.

170
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:36,404
And I said, "Okay, we just call
us the Free Burma Rangers."

171
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,909
As we've grown, people
have come from the outside

172
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,160
to help as volunteers.

173
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,829
To support the teams in the field.

174
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:50,042
What it's about is loving people.

175
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,670
It's saying here's everything
I have, it's yours.

176
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,213
How can we serve you?

177
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:57,883
And give them immediate and
best medical care we can give.

178
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:01,095
All the food and supplies we can give.

179
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:04,598
And to do it bravely and boldly.

180
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,228
And become a family.

181
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:12,333
- An IDP is an Internally
Displaced Person.

182
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,375
We're at an IDP site.

183
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:17,713
And they've had to flee because
their homes been burned.

184
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,798
The Burma Army is just over there.

185
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:21,217
And if you look at how they're living,

186
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,135
it's not much.

187
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:56,001
- It's important to document and
archive what's happening.

188
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,586
So that people can see with their own eyes

189
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:58,712
and make their own decisions.

190
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:00,214
That's really happening.

191
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:03,467
The Armenian Massacre has
been denied by many people.

192
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:05,094
Many people denied the Jews were

193
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,971
getting killed in World War II.

194
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,014
But once people saw with their
own eyes, the photographs,

195
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:11,976
the film of what's happened,
they're like, oh, that's real.

196
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,789
- As we went on these relief missions,

197
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:36,834
Monkey started filming all the abuses,

198
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,586
all the situations we saw
in the jungle.

199
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,197
- And the people who did it.

200
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,281
They got away with it.

201
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:51,784
Just evil.

202
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,799
We walked over and we prayed for

203
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,342
the people that had been killed.

204
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:09,760
Dear God, thank you for this lady,

205
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,136
thank you for these people,

206
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,639
thank you for having them in heaven.

207
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,933
And we said, "We can't
make any of this right,

208
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:19,812
"but I know God doesn't
like it and we're with you.

209
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,484
"We'll help you the best we can."

210
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:34,660
So, all we could do is
pray for the family,

211
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,412
write the story up and send it out.

212
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,540
To anybody on our list who cares.

213
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:43,502
Churches, U.S. State
Department, Foreign Governments.

214
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,009
I hope someone does something with it.

215
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:36,055
Do you think to change your
country is easy or hard?

216
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,142
- Hard.

217
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:43,896
Do you think the enemy is
serious or not so serious?

218
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,273
- Serious.

219
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,360
Never give up, never surrender.

220
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:02,956
After 24 years, we have
trained over 4,500 teams,

221
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:05,959
to get them ready to help
in a conflict situation.

222
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,843
They can be a man or woman, young or old.

223
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:22,309
And people can be from any religion.

224
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:25,062
They just have to come because
they love their people.

225
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,355
And they have to have courage,

226
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:29,733
which means they cannot run
if the people cannot run.

227
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,360
And we move with the resistance.

228
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,154
We use Free Burma Rangers t-shirts

229
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:36,281
but look pretty much like them.

230
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,033
But we don't have a
program to arm our teams.

231
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:39,785
We're not pacifists, but if
they are gonna be armed,

232
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,078
they arm themselves.

233
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:56,552
- We'll set up the route.

234
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,428
And then we'll go village by village.

235
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:07,187
Our mission will be comprised of

236
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:09,773
setting up a medical clinic,
doing a kids program,

237
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:11,692
and then sometimes a team will go off

238
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:14,027
and do a recon of Burma
Army at the same time.

239
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,866
- In Burma, on
missions, you're walking.

240
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,803
- I think the early days,

241
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:41,221
I felt like I could do that,

242
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:42,806
I could hike with the backpack.

243
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,311
But when the kids came along,

244
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,397
definitely became more challenging.

245
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:00,240
Early on, Dave and I had decided,

246
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,118
that we were going to
keep our kids with us.

247
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,661
You know it took a little
bit of conversation.

248
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:07,831
But I knew we wanted to
stay together as a family.

249
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:10,542
And I knew I wanted to support his vision.

250
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,294
But it was often day to
day, I thought this was

251
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,588
the craziest thing in the world to do.

252
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:21,053
- Go Ranger, go Ranger.

253
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,723
- The risks were challenging.

254
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:27,434
The health risks were always
out there for little kids.

255
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:30,187
Whether it's what you eat,
whether it's what bit you.

256
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:33,315
- This is the skin
of a python that we ate.

257
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,400
- Whether it's what you fall off of.

258
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,778
- What does a baby tiger say?

259
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:38,654
- Roar!

260
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:39,863
- Yikes.

261
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:42,324
- I learned early on
not to play with fear.

262
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:45,410
In a very uncontrolled situation.

263
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,663
- You're gonna jump over a
log so just hold on, okay?

264
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:50,666
- Burma is wild.

265
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,834
We would ride our horses
through the jungles.

266
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:56,255
Or we would swim in the
waterfalls, in the rivers.

267
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,966
Had numerous amounts of pets.

268
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:01,134
Workouts with the rangers in the morning.

269
00:21:04,262 --> 00:21:07,391
- So, when I was growing up,
I always loved the water.

270
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:08,892
My dad really encouraged that.

271
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:24,324
- If I could live anywhere in
the world, where would I live?

272
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:27,411
Burma.

273
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:30,580
- My kids have thousands
of aunts and uncles.

274
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,083
In Burma, in Iraq, all over the place.

275
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:39,923
Day in, day out, through
and in up the mountains.

276
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,593
Just rolling just like the ethnic people.

277
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:45,554
It's not like my kids are the only ones.

278
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:48,765
You look at any ethnic
group in the mountains.

279
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:49,933
That's just normal life.

280
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:57,524
- You do your work, and I want
you to solve your problems.

281
00:21:58,358 --> 00:21:59,735
- Did you do anything wrong?

282
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:04,781
- Raising kids in Burma
was an amazing experience.

283
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:46,656
- You say.

284
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:58,043
- The war in Burma is the longest running

285
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,753
civil war in the world.

286
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:00,670
My old brother!

287
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,422
And it continues even to right now.

288
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:25,112
- I think that there is a sense
of the spiritual connection.

289
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:29,783
When you know that you have
an inconfidence or insecurity

290
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,868
about where you are and what you're doing.

291
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:35,247
Doesn't matter how bad it is.

292
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:38,041
If you run we'll run with you.

293
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:39,501
But we're not gonna be gone.

294
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,503
If you're having a problem

295
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:43,839
we are staying with you
no matter what happens.

296
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:56,017
- All of us could be these people.

297
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,312
They didn't choose to come here,

298
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:00,814
they were forced to come here.

299
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:04,192
Or die or be slaves.

300
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,735
So, Lord, help us tell their stories

301
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:07,779
and ask the right questions.

302
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:10,740
And bless these guys,
Lord, every one of us.

303
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,701
In Jesus' name, Amen.

304
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:13,535
Keep going.

305
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,921
- Right in the tree line right there.

306
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,007
You can hear the shooting.

307
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:12,802
So that truck just fled.

308
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:14,804
There's a mortar.

309
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:18,934
Guys running down the road.

310
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:37,953
Burma Army is coming, about 7 kilometers

311
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,288
4.5 miles away, that way.

312
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:41,539
They're all running away.

313
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,502
- The kids and I don't
go on recon missions.

314
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:47,128
The missions are for the Rangers.

315
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:30,380
- Ya they see us here.

316
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:41,933
We're there with a medic
in case someone gets shot.

317
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:44,728
But also with cameras, to
film, what now is a fire fight.

318
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:46,688
Between the Kachin Army.

319
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:48,273
Trying to hold back the Burma Army

320
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,525
who's in the jungle
across the little creek.

321
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:52,527
You here that?

322
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:54,946
That's the flank.

323
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:56,948
Someones over there.

324
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,297
We're showing the Burma Army.

325
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:14,841
They've captured 18
people from this village.

326
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:16,718
Shooting the heck out of us right now.

327
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:20,221
And, they'd kill us if they can.

328
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:23,767
Our job is to stand with these people.

329
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:26,353
Get the news out and survive.

330
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,191
All right, I'll send you,

331
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:32,776
I don't know what time
I can get it out today.

332
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:33,860
Depends on what happens here.

333
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,071
But I'll send you a
report and some photos.

334
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:38,948
That's Denis Gray, AP News.

335
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:48,375
AP News sent it all over.

336
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,382
BBC used it.

337
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,175
That's what we were able to document.

338
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:06,059
The news getting out is a success.

339
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:08,728
But it's just a piece of a large goal.

340
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:13,149
I think the largest goal
we have is find a way,

341
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:14,943
not just to solve a
problem or bring justice,

342
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,111
but reconciliation.

343
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:22,450
- Before I got married, I was
a special education teacher.

344
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,661
And now that I was in these villages,

345
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:27,330
I was asking myself how can I bring hope?

346
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,332
How can I bring new life to the situation?

347
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:30,625
Good Afternoon.

348
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:32,085
Hope is what keeps us going.

349
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:37,674
So, we will sing songs

350
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:40,093
and have some drama and some teaching.

351
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:43,888
Good life for your soul and
good life for your body.

352
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:01,948
I hope they go away with encouragement.

353
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:03,575
That people love them.

354
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:07,620
Like your shirt says "good
life comes from God".

355
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:11,374
I will pray God gives you a
lot of good life in your heart.

356
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:17,255
That good will over come evil.

357
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:22,093
And green, God gives you good things.

358
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:25,638
Because you can't control
what happens in the future.

359
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:46,785
The next year it was completely empty.

360
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,371
And how quickly did they have to leave?

361
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:02,342
Read, it says, a thief steals things,

362
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:06,679
soldiers fight for our country.

363
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:36,835
The next day, we met a lady
who came to us and said,

364
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:39,629
"Please help me bury my
mother and my brother.

365
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:41,923
"They were killed by the
Burma Army last week.

366
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:43,883
"Will you help me?"

367
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,845
And we prayed and said yes.

368
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:54,143
And I ask that you bless her.

369
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:56,604
And give her in this land peace,

370
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:59,857
from this day on, in Jesus name, Amen.

371
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,069
While we were in this village,

372
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:04,529
I'm standing with a pastor.

373
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:05,947
He suddenly gets a message.

374
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,492
The Burma Army have gone into

375
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:13,162
the house of two young volunteers.

376
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:17,292
20 year old volunteers who were
Kachin missionary teachers.

377
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:21,129
And they'd gone in and
they'd raped these woman

378
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:22,839
and then beat them to death.

379
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,507
We already had a photo of it.

380
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:28,177
You can see the woman.

381
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:31,764
Fingers broken, blood everywhere.

382
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:34,934
And you see this huge piece
of wood about this long

383
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:36,686
that thick with blood all over it

384
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:39,063
where they'd just beaten
these ladies to death.

385
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:41,774
After they raped them.

386
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:50,241
I want you to see this photo.

387
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:00,168
How do you feel?

388
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:02,378
Anger?

389
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:04,672
I tell you how I feel.

390
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:09,135
I wanna kill every Burmese soldier.

391
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:14,724
That's what I want to do.

392
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:19,812
Dear God, I am so sorry for those girls,

393
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:20,688
and their family.

394
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,235
I do want to kill all the Burma Army,

395
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:28,029
no question in my mind.

396
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:30,490
Help me know how to --

397
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,241
I don't know how to forgive them.

398
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:35,620
I only dare to do that
because you commanded it.

399
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,829
I don't even want to forgive them.

400
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:38,081
I just want to kill them.

401
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:40,625
But I'll obey you Lord.

402
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:44,337
So help me to forgive
them and to love them.

403
00:32:47,965 --> 00:32:50,176
So, all we could do is write the story up.

404
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:53,554
Pray for the family, write
the story and send it out.

405
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:55,139
And it went all over the world.

406
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:11,614
It would be really simple if the world

407
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:13,908
was just like Lord of the Rings.

408
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:15,743
Here's the humans and
the elves and the dwarves

409
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:17,370
and the hobbits and we're pretty good.

410
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,622
And there's the evil orcs
and they're all terrible.

411
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:22,333
And so, the line of evil is here.

412
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,961
And they're all evil and we're all good.

413
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:27,422
But in real life the line of good and evil

414
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:30,049
isn't between us and other people.

415
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:32,635
As Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn said,
the Russian dissident.

416
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:35,304
He said, "the line is in our hearts".

417
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:36,389
Each humans heart.

418
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:37,640
This is the first battle.

419
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:51,738
Saw Nay Htoo was a small boy, was
taken by the Burma Army.

420
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:55,575
And then put in the Burma
Army, fighting his own people.

421
00:33:57,493 --> 00:34:00,246
When he came to us, he didn't say a lot.

422
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:02,582
Except we knew he escaped
from the Burma Army.

423
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:24,312
And he came to us and he
said, "you know, I'm so bad.

424
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:26,439
"I don't know if God
would ever forgive me."

425
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:41,162
The people that he confessed all this to,

426
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:42,038
he had attacked.

427
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:48,002
And nobody killed him.

428
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:50,296
And people forgave him.

429
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:11,108
He'd asked to be baptized.

430
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:13,820
So, we baptized him in
the river at our camp.

431
00:35:38,135 --> 00:35:40,888
Forgiveness is a counter warfare

432
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,183
that has eternal energy to it.

433
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:52,210
- Originally reported
by the BBC.

434
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:55,421
The Burma Government has changed
their name to Myanmar,

435
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:57,882
Claiming reforms, and then a ceasefire.

436
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:00,927
Yet new footage filmed
by the Free Burma Rangers

437
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:03,930
proves that the world's longest
running civil war

438
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,556
rages on.

439
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:14,023
- Reports of
atrocities now documented

440
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:17,193
by a group determined to
bring the truth to light.

441
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:20,863
- One camp we filmed was
right after the Burma Army

442
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:24,325
told the United Nations they
don't use any forced labor.

443
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:27,453
Well here was at least 60 people captured,

444
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:30,081
just carrying supplies for the Burma Army.

445
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,248
We sent it out.

446
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:36,545
The next day the UN representative
showed the commander.

447
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:37,922
Hey, what are these people?

448
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:42,385
- Ethnic
separatist are increasingly

449
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:45,054
under attack by the Burmese Army.

450
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:47,014
It's a conflict that outside their region

451
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:48,808
has attracted little attention.

452
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:53,229
- As I speak there are
new attacks going on.

453
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:55,022
Against the Karen, against the Kachin.

454
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:58,985
And over 750,000 Rohingya
chased into Bangladesh.

455
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:01,404
This next story is playing
out with the enbattled

456
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:04,740
Rohingya/Muslim minority in Myanmar.

457
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,909
- Criminal prosecution is warranted

458
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:09,996
in relation to genocide and war crimes.

459
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,429
- We had no plan to grow.

460
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:28,806
But step by step more people joined us

461
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:29,890
and more people helped us.

462
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:30,725
So we did grow.

463
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:33,769
Leaders began to establish themselves

464
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:35,104
for the Free Burma Rangers.

465
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:49,535
They could pretty much run
it without a lot of our help.

466
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:09,180
While we were on a mission in Burma.

467
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,474
I got a message by satellite saying,

468
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:13,934
"Please come and help in Iraq."

469
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:26,155
We had no idea what would happen next.

470
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:39,376
Where's Sahale?

471
00:39:39,376 --> 00:39:41,545
- She's in the other room.

472
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:43,923
- Hey honey, get your pack hun.

473
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:45,007
Gotta roll baby.

474
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:48,552
- So, switching gears
and leaving Burma for

475
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:52,014
other mission opportunities
was real hard for me.

476
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:53,808
I was settled in Burma
and I had a lot of plans

477
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:56,227
for what I was going to do.

478
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:02,066
And I feel god saying,
"Just stay in there Karen.

479
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,192
"This is the path I have for you.

480
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:04,693
"This is the path I have for you.

481
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:07,822
"I'm ready to jump out anytime
and do something normal.

482
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:10,282
"But I really feel like
that is not going to be

483
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:11,700
"the safe place for you.

484
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,453
"As crazy as it seems this path I have,

485
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:18,082
"you and Dave, together in
unison, with your family.

486
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,959
"And the plan I have,

487
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:21,293
being consistent,

488
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:25,673
is the safest place and the
richest place for you to live."

489
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:37,726
- We got invited to Kurdistan, Iraq.

490
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:50,072
ISIS killed the Yazidi's by the thousands.

491
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:53,617
We're looking to the west at Mosul.

492
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:54,952
Which is just right there.

493
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:59,665
Mosul is the second biggest city in Iraq.

494
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:01,375
It's called Nineveh in the Bible.

495
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:02,960
It's the place Jonah went.

496
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,837
And this city was one of the

497
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:07,840
cities taken over by ISIS in 2014.

498
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,760
At that time the Iraqi Army is just

499
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,513
starting to attack Mosul to push ISIS out.

500
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:15,764
We said, "God do you want us to go to

501
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:17,349
"Mosul and help the Iraqi's?"

502
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:19,143
We don't know any Iraqis.

503
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:21,061
And we just prayed.

504
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,481
An hour after that prayer,

505
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:27,067
we got a phone call
from a big organization

506
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:28,861
that said, "We got a lot of food,

507
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:31,822
"but our security rules
don't allow us to deliver it

508
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:33,699
"into the fighting areas of East Mosul.

509
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:34,658
"Would you do it?"

510
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:36,869
We said, "We just prayed about this.

511
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:38,704
"Yeah we'll do it."

512
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:50,591
Iraq, the mechanized
desert country with modern

513
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:52,718
utilities, and services.

514
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:56,722
You know in Burma, it's our
home. We know the people.

515
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:58,224
We know how to work.

516
00:41:58,224 --> 00:41:59,558
We're pretty good at it.

517
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:01,852
A lot of that's because there's
nothing to compare us to.

518
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:02,978
We're really not that good,

519
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:04,313
it's just that we're there.

520
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:09,693
We don't know the Iraqi Army.

521
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:12,363
We had no permits to get past checkpoints.

522
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:15,032
We did not know exactly
where this place was.

523
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:15,866
But we went.

524
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,586
They normally just stop you,

525
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:29,838
because you have no
permission to be there.

526
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:31,799
But they just smiled and waved us through.

527
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:33,550
This is one of the first vehicles to move

528
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:36,178
on this road in two years.

529
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:39,014
There's still IED's all
along the side of the road.

530
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:42,268
We got to the edge of East Mosul.

531
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:43,811
We turn, as soon as we started turning

532
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:45,521
and going across this dirt open expanse.

533
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:47,106
ISIS opened fire from our front.

534
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,609
Are you filming.

535
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:53,570
That's a mortar just
landed in front of us.

536
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:54,405
They're hammering us.

537
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:55,239
We were like Mr. Bean.

538
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,615
We could've drove right into them.

539
00:42:56,615 --> 00:42:58,951
Iraqi flag, go towards that.

540
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:00,786
We end up at the Iraqi Army.

541
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:02,162
And the Iraqi Army Commander said,

542
00:43:02,162 --> 00:43:04,456
"Who are you and how did you get here?"

543
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:07,167
I said, "God sent us here to help you.

544
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:08,377
"Everything I have is yours.

545
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:09,461
"How can we help you?"

546
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:17,761
General Mustafa is an Iraqi General,

547
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:19,888
who commanded the 36th Brigade.

548
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:21,473
I'm describing the Free Burma Rangers.

549
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:23,100
And how we are very small
but we want to help.

550
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:26,729
And I'm trying to make a
good impression as well.

551
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:30,149
And in the end I say,
you know, "Can I pray?"

552
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:31,734
They said, "Of course."

553
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:35,612
But then I felt God's voice or thought

554
00:43:35,612 --> 00:43:37,364
get on your knees and pray.

555
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:39,283
I'm like get on my knees?

556
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:41,368
I'll look like a Christian nutcase, man.

557
00:43:41,368 --> 00:43:42,202
They don't even know me.

558
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:43,912
I'm gunna get on my
knees in front of them?

559
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:46,957
I don't even pray on my
knees at home, you know?

560
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:47,833
I knew that voice.

561
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:49,084
I said okay God.

562
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:51,670
I got on my knees and just prayed for them

563
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:52,630
and for how we could serve them.

564
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:56,383
And I got up, the Iraqi General
said, "You're just like us.

565
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:57,843
"You know you're not God.

566
00:43:57,843 --> 00:43:59,720
"You have a fear and respect of God.

567
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,764
"You know you need God and you honor him.

568
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:08,771
"So, you can go anywhere
you want in my country."

569
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:09,605
Wow.

570
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:14,485
- We brought the things we had been doing

571
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:15,903
for 20 years in Burma,

572
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:17,696
to see how it would work there.

573
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:20,741
- All the food and supplies.

574
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:23,035
We took it in and delivered it.

575
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:26,330
And developed a very close
relationship with the Iraqi Army.

576
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:30,668
That enabled us to do work all over Mosul.

577
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:35,923
This your family?

578
00:44:47,684 --> 00:44:49,603
- Awesome, we love you!

579
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:10,833
Muhammed became my driver.

580
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:13,210
When we were assigned a
Humvee with the Iraqi Army.

581
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:14,878
He is tough as nails.

582
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:18,340
And Shaheen, my friend, my interpreter,

583
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:20,217
came with me from Kurdistan.

584
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:23,345
Hilarious guy, very sarcastic.

585
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:29,351
He drank non stop, wild
tiger, and smoked cigarettes.

586
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:34,314
But never got tired working with us.

587
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:36,775
We'd be very minimal in
our effect with out them.

588
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:03,051
The Burma team members we bring.

589
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:04,553
Are absolutely key because those are

590
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:07,556
the qualified and skilled
medics and videographers.

591
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:13,687
But we also have many
international volunteers

592
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:15,647
people from the U.S. from Europe.

593
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:16,773
All over the world.

594
00:46:16,773 --> 00:46:20,569
All come to be where
the greatest need was.

595
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:22,988
And that was at the very front.

596
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,911
I'm 57 now.

597
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:30,454
I'm not 30 years old.

598
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:33,373
And my running times are twice as slow

599
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:35,083
and nothing works as well.

600
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:37,002
But it was God's plan, just keep going.

601
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:02,194
- We we're invited to do a kids program

602
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:05,489
in an area that was still quite dangerous.

603
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:12,412
- We are in Mosul, on
the outskirts of Mosul.

604
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:15,666
And we are going to do a kids program

605
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:17,918
for the kids around this area.

606
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:42,401
- Hello, Hello, Hello.

607
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:43,694
God bless you,
in Jesus' name.

608
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:46,572
- They found a school.

609
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:48,490
Meaning there were walls around it.

610
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:52,494
Where it would be a closed
and easily protected venue.

611
00:47:57,624 --> 00:48:01,461
- You want to check the women, just very,

612
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:02,880
smile and pray for them.

613
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,007
Give them a good chance to pray
in Jesus name with each one.

614
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:06,466
Check for suicide vests.

615
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:11,847
- The whole environment was
very fragile and tenuous.

616
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:12,973
And these people's lives.

617
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:15,559
They had really just lost everything.

618
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:36,955
Even the Iraqi Army had joined in.

619
00:48:36,955 --> 00:48:38,832
I think it was a real break for them.

620
00:48:38,832 --> 00:48:42,294
To be doing something fun, and then--

621
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:48,300
We could hear explosions going off.

622
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:56,099
You could see people's
eyebrows kind of going up

623
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:57,184
and looking around.

624
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:04,816
It clearly was getting closer.

625
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:06,360
We need to finish up now.

626
00:49:08,153 --> 00:49:11,031
And we stopped whatever we were doing.

627
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:14,701
They were not upset.

628
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:15,911
They were not fazed.

629
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:18,664
They actually wanted their
stuff be for they could go.

630
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:20,666
We want our shirt and our bracelet.

631
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:27,255
Unfortunately, the kids are used to this.

632
00:49:27,255 --> 00:49:31,969
It was new for us.

633
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:41,061
I thought, thank god that we
were able to share with them

634
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:42,604
something about good life.

635
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:45,482
Before they left the door.

636
00:50:06,878 --> 00:50:08,463
It's a much more intense situation

637
00:50:08,463 --> 00:50:10,799
than I ever have been in before.

638
00:50:12,634 --> 00:50:13,844
In the back of my mind,

639
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:16,304
I'm thinking how far is
that going to take Dave?

640
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:34,489
- Well Lord, help them
miss with their weapons.

641
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:36,324
Especially the RPG's.

642
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:40,412
Thank you, Lord.

643
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:44,416
- That was a mortar.
- That was a good miss.

644
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:47,878
Fighting in Iraq was different
than Burma, the scale of it.

645
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:52,257
Tanks, anti-tanks systems,
aircraft, helicopters.

646
00:50:52,257 --> 00:50:55,969
ISIS was very well armed.

647
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:57,763
The volume of fire was incredible.

648
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:01,808
I think probably any given day in Mosul

649
00:51:01,808 --> 00:51:06,730
more shooting happened
than any year in Burma.

650
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,233
In the first few months,

651
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:12,778
we're with the Iraqi Army
pushing forward to Mosul.

652
00:51:14,112 --> 00:51:16,072
We're right behind the leading element.

653
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:19,367
We want to document what was happening.

654
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:22,245
And were taking care of causalities.

655
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:27,209
And this went on and on and on and on.

656
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:28,418
Month after month.

657
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:29,753
And people were fleeing all the time,

658
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:30,879
just trying to get out.

659
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:38,136
No matter the obstacles or danger.

660
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:39,387
We knew we had to help.

661
00:51:40,555 --> 00:51:41,890
Alive!

662
00:53:22,115 --> 00:53:23,116
All right, Dave Eubank,

663
00:53:23,116 --> 00:53:24,826
Free Burma, Free Kurd Rangers,

664
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:29,247
We're going to a town that ISIS
has held for two years now,

665
00:53:29,247 --> 00:53:32,125
to be part of the group that liberates it.

666
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:33,376
All in Jesus name.

667
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:36,213
And thank you for all your
help and support and prayers.

668
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:45,513
When we were in Mosul.

669
00:53:45,513 --> 00:53:47,766
And the campaign all around Mosul.

670
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:50,101
The Iraqi Army had
liberated a farming area

671
00:53:50,101 --> 00:53:51,561
with three families.

672
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:53,355
And as we went down there,

673
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:54,856
the people were first afraid of us.

674
00:53:54,856 --> 00:53:56,691
And then we told them we
were there to help them.

675
00:53:56,691 --> 00:53:58,526
And the started hugging us.

676
00:53:58,526 --> 00:54:01,279
Hello, God bless you in Jesus name.

677
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:02,697
God bless you in Jesus name.

678
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:08,954
This is the first liberated
village we've come to.

679
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:10,413
What's the name of this place?

680
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:13,541
I prayed with them.

681
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:16,211
And they were so happy, I was happy.

682
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:18,213
And this little three year old
girl's grabbing my pant leg.

683
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:19,589
America America.

684
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:20,799
I turned to Monkey and I said,

685
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:22,801
"Monkey, this is the best day
of this whole operation man.

686
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:24,844
"We got to be apart of liberating people."

687
00:54:24,844 --> 00:54:26,221
He goes, "Yes".

688
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:27,389
Family load up in the tractor.

689
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:29,391
They drive out towards their relatives.

690
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:32,519
What they don't know
is when ISIS retreated

691
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:33,937
they laid land mines.

692
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:35,188
They blew the whole family up.

693
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:39,859
Right in our sight.

694
00:54:39,859 --> 00:54:41,736
You could see it about 300 yards away.

695
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:28,283
I see one of my medics
working on this little girl.

696
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:31,911
I'm praying Jesus, save this girl.

697
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:37,417
She dies right there.

698
00:55:39,335 --> 00:55:41,296
Same one who had just been hugging my leg.

699
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:43,381
The same one that was part
of that beautiful day.

700
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:44,215
Gone.

701
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:57,020
We evacuated the wounded
the best we could.

702
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,063
And I turned to Monkey.

703
00:55:58,063 --> 00:56:00,607
And I said, "Monkey, that's it man.

704
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:02,650
"We're gonna hunt down ISIS from now on."

705
00:56:04,402 --> 00:56:06,863
This is why.

706
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:08,406
The reason we fight ISIS.

707
00:56:13,578 --> 00:56:15,163
Is because of this.

708
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:16,539
Killed that little kid.

709
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:17,457
Blew up the family.

710
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:20,168
People who do that.

711
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:21,628
You have to kill them until they decide

712
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:22,462
they're not going to do it.

713
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:24,214
And we pray for them to surrender.

714
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:26,883
But when they stand and do that.

715
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:32,097
Then they have chosen to die.

716
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:33,348
We are going to share the gospel of Jesus.

717
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:34,933
We are going to give
food and medical care.

718
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:36,309
But I can't live with myself.

719
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:38,103
Letting this happen again
and again and again.

720
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:39,896
And we're not the answer to the problem.

721
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:42,232
But we're going to go after
it. And that's justice.

722
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:43,691
What do you think?
He said,

723
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:44,526
I think it's right.

724
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:45,360
Let's ask God.

725
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:05,338
So, that night I said, "Lord
Jesus, show me the truth

726
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:06,589
"of what happened today."

727
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:10,135
Open my Kindle up to the Bible.

728
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:11,136
And I put my finger.

729
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:12,804
And it said, "Vengeance
is mine said the Lord,

730
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:13,847
"I will repay."

731
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:16,307
Vengeance.

732
00:57:16,307 --> 00:57:18,768
Oh, what I thought was
justice was Vengeance.

733
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:39,247
Vengeance, looks like justice.

734
00:57:39,247 --> 00:57:41,082
But is driven by hate.

735
00:57:41,082 --> 00:57:42,458
It starts in the same place.

736
00:57:42,458 --> 00:57:44,836
An injustice had been done.

737
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:46,629
What are you going to do about it.

738
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:49,257
To get justice requires you to approach

739
00:57:49,257 --> 00:57:53,094
that in just act with
love for the perpetrator

740
00:57:53,094 --> 00:57:56,347
and the person who's hurt, and mercy.

741
00:57:56,347 --> 00:57:57,891
There's a place for punishment too.

742
00:57:57,891 --> 00:58:00,226
But it will be done, and enforcement,

743
00:58:00,226 --> 00:58:02,395
But it will be done in the spirit of love.

744
00:58:02,395 --> 00:58:03,480
Which is very different.

745
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:06,065
What's the best for both these people?

746
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:07,817
And I said, "Jesus, forgive me,"

747
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:10,945
and "I reject vengeance."
And he took it away from me.

748
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:13,948
And it was a huge crushing wait on me,

749
00:58:13,948 --> 00:58:16,492
but I could not feel it
until it was lifted off.

750
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:23,082
If I had kept that that
would of warped me.

751
00:58:23,082 --> 00:58:24,042
But I'm light and free.

752
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:25,627
I don't have to fight anybody.

753
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:27,295
I don't have to kill anybody.

754
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:28,838
I don't have to bring any justice.

755
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:31,132
I just got to obey Jesus.
That's all I got to do.

756
00:58:31,132 --> 00:58:33,051
I'll be his servant, his ambassador.

757
00:58:42,143 --> 00:58:43,269
- That kicks.

758
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:53,947
- My parents they love us a lot.

759
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:55,698
And they believe that our upbringing

760
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:56,950
and what we've done growing up

761
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:58,993
is the best thing that they can offer us.

762
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:08,086
- My mom and dad gave
me this amazing life.

763
00:59:12,173 --> 00:59:13,258
He's also very bold.

764
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:16,135
He would always tell me be
bold in the things of Jesus.

765
00:59:16,135 --> 00:59:18,012
And humble in the things of yourself.

766
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:26,229
- We'd probably be in a boarding
school without them alone.

767
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:27,647
He started bucking.

768
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:30,108
Not being able to do half
of the things that we did.

769
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:33,236
Or learn half of the
things that we've learned.

770
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:35,780
Like humility and hospitality.

771
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:42,328
- Most of the time I just
thank God that I am still alive

772
00:59:42,328 --> 00:59:45,248
and running around and
having fun on this Earth.

773
01:00:02,348 --> 01:00:05,852
- We know that this is a big war.

774
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:07,353
We knew they were going to where the

775
01:00:07,353 --> 01:00:09,397
explosions were the greatest.

776
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:10,481
Because that was the point.

777
01:00:10,481 --> 01:00:12,233
That they're going to the conflict.

778
01:00:14,610 --> 01:00:18,239
I remember praying, "Lord,
help them to accomplish

779
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:19,741
as much as possible."

780
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:48,686
- I've had doubts come
and go and questions.

781
01:00:50,229 --> 01:00:52,190
I don't want to disobey you Lord,

782
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:54,567
so, I'm going to ask
you "What should I do?"

783
01:00:54,567 --> 01:00:55,735
"Lord, what do I do?"

784
01:00:58,321 --> 01:00:59,489
No matter what it costs.

785
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:17,507
In Mosul, at the end of May, ISIS is along

786
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:18,925
with shooting Iraqi soldiers,

787
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:20,968
they're shooting civilians.

788
01:01:20,968 --> 01:01:24,138
And there was a fatwa put out
by one of the ISIS groups.

789
01:01:24,138 --> 01:01:28,101
It said, "Better to kill your own family

790
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:29,310
"than let them escape.

791
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:30,728
"The highest act of love is to kill

792
01:01:30,728 --> 01:01:31,604
your own wife and children

793
01:01:31,604 --> 01:01:32,897
"than let them fall in the hands of the

794
01:01:32,897 --> 01:01:34,857
"Iraqi's and the infidels."

795
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:35,692
Wow.

796
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,158
These are people fleeing.

797
01:01:44,158 --> 01:01:45,159
Streaming out.

798
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:46,577
They said they had to hide from ISIS.

799
01:01:46,577 --> 01:01:48,621
Who try to block them.

800
01:01:48,621 --> 01:01:51,457
And they're making a run for it now.

801
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:54,127
So, more people are
getting shot as they're

802
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:54,961
trying to flee ISIS.

803
01:01:54,961 --> 01:01:56,295
Some are ISIS families directly.

804
01:01:56,295 --> 01:01:57,797
Some are just people
who have been under ISIS

805
01:01:57,797 --> 01:01:59,632
and now is their chance to break free.

806
01:02:21,654 --> 01:02:23,489
We were trying to rescue families.

807
01:02:23,489 --> 01:02:26,701
By going into an ISIS controlled
area and taking people out.

808
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:30,621
Civilians three years, trapped by ISIS.

809
01:02:30,621 --> 01:02:32,582
Every time we busted into a new place,

810
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:34,876
we see a hole in the wall
and people hiding underneath.

811
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:36,711
Civilians would come fleeing.

812
01:02:36,711 --> 01:02:38,045
Handing us babies.

813
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:54,145
We ran into more and more resistance.

814
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:55,646
And we were stopped on the street

815
01:02:55,646 --> 01:02:57,190
about three or four in the afternoon.

816
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:59,901
And we got so much fire, we
couldn't push any further.

817
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:07,658
Hussein went out in the street

818
01:03:07,658 --> 01:03:08,868
and I went out there with him.

819
01:03:10,745 --> 01:03:12,830
Within seconds I'm looking this way,

820
01:03:12,830 --> 01:03:14,791
I heard gunshots this way.

821
01:03:19,003 --> 01:03:21,756
Seven yards away I see three ISIS.

822
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:23,382
They've been watching us.

823
01:03:23,382 --> 01:03:24,425
Shot me once in the arm.

824
01:03:24,425 --> 01:03:25,885
Two hit my helmet.

825
01:03:29,388 --> 01:03:32,099
Brought my rifle up and started shooting.

826
01:03:32,099 --> 01:03:33,392
And I said, "God help me."

827
01:03:34,393 --> 01:03:36,395
Hussein was shot six times.

828
01:03:38,272 --> 01:03:42,818
- Hand grenade.

829
01:03:58,918 --> 01:04:01,629
- This is my good doctor friend, Obed.

830
01:04:01,629 --> 01:04:02,463
Patching me up.

831
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:05,341
I'm very fortunate.

832
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:19,480
What do we gotta do?

833
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:22,275
Can we find another way?

834
01:04:29,865 --> 01:04:31,158
A lot of us had near misses.

835
01:04:31,158 --> 01:04:32,451
Our vehicles were shot up.

836
01:04:33,869 --> 01:04:34,954
And we're looking at our vehicle,

837
01:04:34,954 --> 01:04:38,082
I open the hood up and I see
transmission shot to pieces.

838
01:04:38,082 --> 01:04:39,041
I ask an Iraqi soldier.

839
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:40,209
"You think I can drive this thing still?"

840
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:41,043
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

841
01:04:41,043 --> 01:04:41,878
We'll fix that later.

842
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:43,504
Okay, and I check it and it moves.

843
01:04:44,422 --> 01:04:46,716
And we're looking at,
you know, what we can do.

844
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:48,175
And we move the casualties out.

845
01:04:48,175 --> 01:04:49,176
And all of a sudden an Iraqi soldier

846
01:04:49,176 --> 01:04:50,094
comes running over the hill.

847
01:04:50,094 --> 01:04:51,012
This little hill.

848
01:04:51,012 --> 01:04:52,889
They just killed a family in the street.

849
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:54,223
Help, somebody help!

850
01:05:01,188 --> 01:05:02,982
There's a mother shot in the street.

851
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:06,944
There's a father rolling
around shot in the leg.

852
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:16,787
ISIS just opens up on three sides.

853
01:05:16,787 --> 01:05:19,081
Bullets are pinging off
the Humvee like crazy.

854
01:05:20,958 --> 01:05:22,501
Bullets just miss me.

855
01:05:22,501 --> 01:05:23,920
I jump in the passenger seat.

856
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,255
Go, go, go, back up.

857
01:05:26,255 --> 01:05:27,506
The vehicle won't go backwards,

858
01:05:27,506 --> 01:05:29,925
because the transmission is too shot.

859
01:05:35,973 --> 01:05:38,351
And ISIS is shooting our vehicle apart.

860
01:05:50,696 --> 01:05:52,365
At that moment Muhammed
is sitting across from me

861
01:05:52,365 --> 01:05:54,325
and he goes, "I'm gonna
get help." And I said no!

862
01:05:54,325 --> 01:05:55,493
Let me call on the radio.

863
01:05:55,493 --> 01:05:56,702
But I can't stop Muhammed.

864
01:05:56,702 --> 01:05:58,746
Muhammed jumps out and
runs through a hail of fire.

865
01:05:58,746 --> 01:06:00,706
Muhammed brings another Humvee.

866
01:06:00,706 --> 01:06:03,626
Drives around the safe side of us.

867
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:05,711
Shaheen's getting out so
we can get the shot girl

868
01:06:05,711 --> 01:06:06,754
and the father out.

869
01:06:12,426 --> 01:06:15,638
Shaheen's shot in the stomach
and just falls to the ground.

870
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:17,306
You can hear that cry of the soul.

871
01:06:21,686 --> 01:06:24,271
And I see Muhammed run.

872
01:06:24,271 --> 01:06:26,357
Grab Shaheen and drag him to his Humvee.

873
01:06:26,357 --> 01:06:29,360
And Muhammed gets shot
eight times doing that.

874
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:31,237
Finally, an Abrams tank
comes up next to us.

875
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:32,154
From the Iraqis.

876
01:06:34,281 --> 01:06:37,284
And just starts blasting ISIS point blank.

877
01:06:37,284 --> 01:06:40,788
And then an Iraqi soldier and Justin

878
01:06:40,788 --> 01:06:42,957
used the tank as a
shield, and pull us out.

879
01:07:04,729 --> 01:07:06,772
Eight days later I call Shaheen.

880
01:07:06,772 --> 01:07:08,274
I said, "How are you?"

881
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:10,651
He's like, "I'll be okay, don't let

882
01:07:10,651 --> 01:07:11,986
"them take all your
money to take care of me.

883
01:07:11,986 --> 01:07:13,571
"They're gonna cheat you man. "

884
01:07:13,571 --> 01:07:15,239
I said we'll take care of you.

885
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:20,077
Two days later he was dead.

886
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:22,288
Had an infection.

887
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:37,011
That hurt my heart.

888
01:07:38,554 --> 01:07:40,014
And I just broke down.

889
01:07:40,014 --> 01:07:40,973
I missed him a lot.

890
01:07:42,266 --> 01:07:45,853
Because Shaheen was
not just my translator.

891
01:07:47,104 --> 01:07:48,355
He became like a brother.

892
01:07:51,609 --> 01:07:56,614
Shaheen represents to me,
the best of being human.

893
01:07:58,407 --> 01:08:01,952
We have a man, a Yazidi, who
was persecutor on all sides.

894
01:08:01,952 --> 01:08:03,662
But gave his life, he didn't want to die.

895
01:08:03,662 --> 01:08:05,122
But he put it out there
to help someone else.

896
01:08:05,122 --> 01:08:08,375
To help a little kid and her father, live.

897
01:08:12,505 --> 01:08:13,672
Muhammed's alive.

898
01:08:13,672 --> 01:08:14,507
Muhammed, how are you?

899
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:16,592
I'm very sad about Shaheen.

900
01:08:16,592 --> 01:08:17,718
I said, "You did your best man.

901
01:08:17,718 --> 01:08:18,552
"How are you?

902
01:08:18,552 --> 01:08:19,637
"Shot eight times."

903
01:09:23,617 --> 01:09:25,494
Shaheen died, he lived.

904
01:09:25,494 --> 01:09:26,412
I don't know why.

905
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:27,246
I don't know how.

906
01:09:29,415 --> 01:09:30,416
Maybe God help me.

907
01:09:32,418 --> 01:09:33,794
I don't understand.

908
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:20,257
- All good?

909
01:10:22,384 --> 01:10:23,969
Hey, where are you?

910
01:10:29,141 --> 01:10:32,603
- When I look around it's just despairing.

911
01:10:32,603 --> 01:10:35,230
But I know Jesus has promised things

912
01:10:35,230 --> 01:10:37,816
that are better than the reality you see.

913
01:10:37,816 --> 01:10:39,860
And so we have to live on those promises.

914
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:41,445
And if you can't rely on that promise,

915
01:10:41,445 --> 01:10:42,363
what is there to rely on?

916
01:10:42,363 --> 01:10:45,491
There's no human answer
that's going to get you

917
01:10:45,491 --> 01:10:46,533
through the next day.

918
01:10:58,587 --> 01:11:00,297
- Well, you have one life,

919
01:11:00,297 --> 01:11:03,092
and you might as well go for it.

920
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:04,426
Because what are you going to hold on to?

921
01:11:04,426 --> 01:11:07,262
You're going to loose
your life one day anyway.

922
01:11:07,262 --> 01:11:11,433
So, saying yes, is God all the
good things you have for us.

923
01:11:11,433 --> 01:11:12,685
I want them.

924
01:11:12,685 --> 01:11:16,313
And anything useful to do that I can do,

925
01:11:16,313 --> 01:11:17,773
I would like to do it.

926
01:11:17,773 --> 01:11:20,109
So, I'll say yes.

927
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:24,780
And I want to say no to the
swamp of sin on one side

928
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:26,198
that gets me bogged down.

929
01:11:26,198 --> 01:11:28,993
And no to the swamp of good things to do,

930
01:11:28,993 --> 01:11:32,162
Christian things to do that
God didn't ask me to do.

931
01:11:32,162 --> 01:11:33,497
That also will bog me down.

932
01:11:34,331 --> 01:11:38,669
And I want to say yes to
that line that God has.

933
01:11:38,669 --> 01:11:41,171
Which I believe has no caution lights.

934
01:11:41,171 --> 01:11:42,881
Its green, go man.

935
01:11:42,881 --> 01:11:44,425
As fast as you want to go.

936
01:11:44,425 --> 01:11:45,384
How much faith do you have?

937
01:11:45,384 --> 01:11:46,844
Go!

938
01:11:46,844 --> 01:11:48,095
That's what I want to do.

939
01:11:53,934 --> 01:11:56,020
- We are going down to the front line.

940
01:11:56,020 --> 01:11:57,938
- Going through the city.

941
01:11:57,938 --> 01:11:59,773
Finding people who need help.

942
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:47,363
- Against the far wall
there were living people.

943
01:12:51,909 --> 01:12:53,368
There was a guy who was shot.

944
01:12:53,368 --> 01:12:56,121
And then there was three little kids

945
01:12:56,121 --> 01:12:57,748
playing among in the dead bodies.

946
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:02,753
One girl kind of sat
next to her dead mother.

947
01:13:02,753 --> 01:13:04,713
Kept hiding under her dead mom's scarf.

948
01:13:13,931 --> 01:13:16,016
If you take one on the street
you're getting shot at.

949
01:13:16,016 --> 01:13:17,309
If you drive an armored vehicle,

950
01:13:17,309 --> 01:13:19,269
it's going to get blown up.

951
01:13:19,269 --> 01:13:20,771
You go near that you're dead.

952
01:13:22,606 --> 01:13:24,066
How can we help these people?

953
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:27,069
And I pray.

954
01:13:27,069 --> 01:13:28,654
And this first comes to me,

955
01:13:28,654 --> 01:13:29,988
"greater love that no man than this.

956
01:13:29,988 --> 01:13:31,115
"than he lay down his life for his friends."

957
01:13:31,115 --> 01:13:32,991
And I say, "God do you want me to do that?

958
01:13:32,991 --> 01:13:33,867
"It's for love."

959
01:13:34,868 --> 01:13:36,495
I don't want to do it.

960
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:39,414
I sent out a message right away.

961
01:13:39,414 --> 01:13:41,500
Saying, "Please pray,
how can we help them?"

962
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:43,168
People started praying all over the world.

963
01:13:43,168 --> 01:13:44,420
- Dave said we don't know what to do.

964
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:48,132
It's much more serious than
anything I've ever seen before.

965
01:13:50,467 --> 01:13:52,970
And a guy calls me from Thailand.

966
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:53,804
One of my Chaplains.

967
01:13:53,804 --> 01:13:56,223
He says, "Dave I saw the
texts and the photos,

968
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:57,266
"I'm praying for you."

969
01:13:57,266 --> 01:14:00,435
When he said that, I felt this infusion.

970
01:14:00,435 --> 01:14:02,146
I think of God's spirit.

971
01:14:02,146 --> 01:14:03,355
They need help.

972
01:14:03,355 --> 01:14:06,024
I need to be willing to lay
my life down to help them.

973
01:14:06,024 --> 01:14:07,317
So, I called my American friends.

974
01:14:07,317 --> 01:14:10,237
I said, "Can you help
give us smoke to obscure?"

975
01:14:10,237 --> 01:14:12,489
And I'll get the Iraqi's
to bring tanks up.

976
01:14:12,489 --> 01:14:13,323
Yes.

977
01:14:14,992 --> 01:14:16,618
And they just started dropping smoke.

978
01:14:24,209 --> 01:14:25,752
By now the two kids have been out.

979
01:14:25,752 --> 01:14:27,212
Kind of in and out and they're dead.

980
01:14:27,212 --> 01:14:28,297
But that little girl.

981
01:14:28,297 --> 01:14:31,592
The angle is such that ISIS
couldn't quite shoot her.

982
01:14:31,592 --> 01:14:32,551
I ask the Iraqi Commander.

983
01:14:32,551 --> 01:14:33,385
Please come and look.

984
01:14:33,385 --> 01:14:34,261
And he looks and I said,

985
01:14:34,261 --> 01:14:36,597
"Look there's enough
smoke, you could do it."

986
01:14:36,597 --> 01:14:38,599
He goes, okay you get one tank.

987
01:14:38,599 --> 01:14:40,350
Right now take it or leave it.

988
01:14:40,350 --> 01:14:41,185
Okay, we take it.

989
01:14:45,147 --> 01:14:46,190
Who would go with me?

990
01:14:47,858 --> 01:14:50,444
Are you willing to die trying to help

991
01:14:50,444 --> 01:14:52,488
someone that looks impossible to save.

992
01:15:10,464 --> 01:15:11,798
The tank was trying to get in position

993
01:15:11,798 --> 01:15:13,467
to make it over the obstacles.

994
01:15:13,467 --> 01:15:15,427
The Americans are still dropping smoke.

995
01:15:16,511 --> 01:15:17,346
We get prepared.

996
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:19,973
And as soon as I saw the tank,

997
01:15:19,973 --> 01:15:21,391
I knew it was time to go.

998
01:15:24,186 --> 01:15:25,896
Because I am trying to
save this little girl.

999
01:15:27,147 --> 01:15:28,232
Jesus help me.

1000
01:15:31,735 --> 01:15:33,195
Whoever wants to go go.

1001
01:16:07,437 --> 01:16:09,064
I felt so terrified.

1002
01:16:09,064 --> 01:16:10,148
Terror and commitment.

1003
01:16:19,074 --> 01:16:21,577
The smoke starts to dissipate.

1004
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:27,833
And I'm on my phone and
call the battle captain.

1005
01:16:31,128 --> 01:16:32,879
Give me more smoke please.

1006
01:16:32,879 --> 01:16:34,548
Otherwise, the tank will get blown up.

1007
01:16:34,548 --> 01:16:38,051
We'll be dead and the people will be dead.

1008
01:16:38,051 --> 01:16:40,345
And they just started dropping smoke.

1009
01:16:40,345 --> 01:16:42,180
Right on target.

1010
01:16:44,099 --> 01:16:45,809
The Iraqi's kept firing.

1011
01:16:47,144 --> 01:16:48,604
And I looked out and I thought

1012
01:16:48,604 --> 01:16:52,899
we're risking loosing everything
to save a little girl.

1013
01:16:57,362 --> 01:16:59,406
I just said, is this the right time Lord?

1014
01:17:00,365 --> 01:17:02,659
Yes, okay.

1015
01:17:11,209 --> 01:17:12,044
And I just ran.

1016
01:17:24,097 --> 01:17:25,349
And I had her.

1017
01:17:34,858 --> 01:17:37,027
I can't believe I'm alive.

1018
01:17:42,157 --> 01:17:43,367
There's two more men there.

1019
01:17:43,367 --> 01:17:44,201
Alive still.

1020
01:17:55,837 --> 01:17:59,758
And we pull the two guys
back, behind the tank.

1021
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:05,263
The tanks taking more fire
and starting to back up now.

1022
01:18:07,474 --> 01:18:10,811
At that moment one of the men,
Ephraim, gets shot in the leg.

1023
01:18:10,811 --> 01:18:12,562
By ISIS, right through the calf.

1024
01:18:18,735 --> 01:18:19,986
I'm holding the girl.

1025
01:18:19,986 --> 01:18:21,488
Trying to shield her with my body.

1026
01:18:21,488 --> 01:18:23,198
Running, praying.

1027
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:24,449
In Jesus name, God help.

1028
01:18:25,909 --> 01:18:28,954
And finally the Humvee comes.

1029
01:18:30,914 --> 01:18:32,958
We put everybody in, I get in.

1030
01:18:32,958 --> 01:18:34,668
Slam the doors and we drive just 40 yards.

1031
01:18:34,668 --> 01:18:36,128
And we're out of the fire.

1032
01:18:40,006 --> 01:18:41,716
- Dave called and he said meet me

1033
01:18:41,716 --> 01:18:43,427
at the casualty collection point.

1034
01:18:48,265 --> 01:18:51,059
We got there, and I'm
not a medical person.

1035
01:18:51,059 --> 01:18:53,603
So, I really don't always know what

1036
01:18:53,603 --> 01:18:55,564
to do in those situations.

1037
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:58,483
But here was a little
girl sitting by herself.

1038
01:18:58,483 --> 01:19:01,611
And as a mom, I definitely
knew what to do then.

1039
01:19:01,611 --> 01:19:04,322
So, I just picked her up
and held her really tight.

1040
01:19:04,322 --> 01:19:05,740
And then she fell asleep.

1041
01:19:11,288 --> 01:19:12,122
It's not done.

1042
01:19:13,165 --> 01:19:17,127
There were more people inside
a building ISIS controlled.

1043
01:19:17,127 --> 01:19:18,670
This complex.

1044
01:19:18,670 --> 01:19:19,755
And after first the rescue.

1045
01:19:19,755 --> 01:19:22,340
The people in the building,
one lady who'd been shot,

1046
01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:23,675
three days now laying there shot.

1047
01:19:23,675 --> 01:19:25,177
No water, just --

1048
01:19:25,177 --> 01:19:26,803
Called on the phone to the Iraqi Army.

1049
01:19:26,803 --> 01:19:28,054
Said, "I'm still alive.

1050
01:19:28,054 --> 01:19:29,681
"There's probably four
or five of us still alive

1051
01:19:29,681 --> 01:19:32,267
"among the 150 dead people.

1052
01:19:32,267 --> 01:19:33,643
"We're in ISIS building

1053
01:19:33,643 --> 01:19:36,438
"but we saw the rescue through the crack.

1054
01:19:37,981 --> 01:19:39,566
"It happened 50 yards from us.

1055
01:19:40,817 --> 01:19:42,736
"Please come get us."

1056
01:19:42,736 --> 01:19:44,863
I was like no way, how are we gonna do it?

1057
01:19:47,991 --> 01:19:49,034
We climbed this wall.

1058
01:19:49,951 --> 01:19:51,036
And we're in.

1059
01:20:14,059 --> 01:20:15,435
We're creeping in quite and

1060
01:20:15,435 --> 01:20:17,604
all of a sudden we come to
this big open room about

1061
01:20:17,604 --> 01:20:19,147
the size of a basketball court.

1062
01:20:20,106 --> 01:20:21,608
The walls we're partially collapsed.

1063
01:20:21,608 --> 01:20:23,568
The roof had holes in it.

1064
01:20:25,195 --> 01:20:26,029
And there were cans.

1065
01:20:26,029 --> 01:20:28,865
About three feet high
as far as you could see.

1066
01:20:28,865 --> 01:20:31,243
And I thought, God you've
got to be kidding me.

1067
01:20:32,118 --> 01:20:33,662
We got to go quietly through that?

1068
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:34,496
Impossible.

1069
01:20:35,705 --> 01:20:36,957
It'll mean they'll know where we are at.

1070
01:20:36,957 --> 01:20:39,042
And all of them can come and slaughter us.

1071
01:20:41,628 --> 01:20:43,213
This was so bad.

1072
01:20:43,213 --> 01:20:45,674
I just felt stripped of everything.

1073
01:20:45,674 --> 01:20:48,760
We had no hope and I'm afraid.

1074
01:20:52,055 --> 01:20:54,683
I never said this in my whole
life in a situation like this.

1075
01:20:57,894 --> 01:20:59,437
And then I thought,
well God is the God that

1076
01:20:59,437 --> 01:21:01,314
parted the Red Sea or he's not.

1077
01:21:01,314 --> 01:21:02,858
And he's the one that brought the walls of

1078
01:21:02,858 --> 01:21:04,150
Jericho down or he's not.

1079
01:21:05,151 --> 01:21:07,487
So, I said in Jesus name, "In Jesus name,

1080
01:21:07,487 --> 01:21:09,406
"Satan and demons, back off."

1081
01:21:11,157 --> 01:21:11,992
Back off.

1082
01:21:13,243 --> 01:21:15,120
ISIS you cannot see, hear, or stop us.

1083
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:16,580
And not only hear,
through this whole rescue,

1084
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:18,873
you have no authority and way to stop us.

1085
01:21:18,873 --> 01:21:20,041
And I explain that in Jesus name.

1086
01:21:20,041 --> 01:21:22,586
If you don't like it talk to Jesus.

1087
01:21:22,586 --> 01:21:23,420
That's his command.

1088
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:25,839
That's his authority and we're behind him.

1089
01:21:25,839 --> 01:21:27,716
And we went across.

1090
01:21:39,394 --> 01:21:40,979
And I felt a growing confidence.

1091
01:21:40,979 --> 01:21:43,148
Not in me, but that God was with us.

1092
01:22:06,212 --> 01:22:09,466
We got through, and we found
one guy shot in the leg.

1093
01:22:09,466 --> 01:22:10,634
He was terrified when we came in.

1094
01:22:10,634 --> 01:22:12,427
He thought we were ISIS.

1095
01:22:12,427 --> 01:22:15,889
And there was a woman on her
stomach who'd made the call.

1096
01:22:15,889 --> 01:22:17,682
Help, and she'd been shot
in the leg three days now.

1097
01:22:17,682 --> 01:22:19,309
Shot in the leg.

1098
01:22:19,309 --> 01:22:21,895
And then her disabled
son about 13 years old.

1099
01:22:21,895 --> 01:22:23,647
And right across from
him was a little girl,

1100
01:22:23,647 --> 01:22:25,273
about six years old.

1101
01:22:25,273 --> 01:22:28,026
And I just prayed, Jesus help her.

1102
01:22:28,026 --> 01:22:30,987
Don't worry. We love you
and we're here to help you.

1103
01:22:30,987 --> 01:22:31,821
We got to get them out now.

1104
01:22:31,821 --> 01:22:34,157
It's gonna probably take us
two hours to carry them out.

1105
01:22:37,577 --> 01:22:39,829
Right then I look out in the street

1106
01:22:39,829 --> 01:22:41,915
and in the rumble in the street,

1107
01:22:41,915 --> 01:22:44,417
three dead people but one person moved.

1108
01:22:46,044 --> 01:22:48,046
I can see it was a woman.

1109
01:22:48,046 --> 01:22:49,381
I can see she'd been shot through the legs

1110
01:22:49,381 --> 01:22:50,215
about 30 yards away.

1111
01:22:50,215 --> 01:22:51,549
And she goes like this.

1112
01:22:51,549 --> 01:22:52,634
I don't know what she said in Arabic.

1113
01:22:52,634 --> 01:22:53,802
But I knew the meaning.

1114
01:22:53,802 --> 01:22:54,636
Help me.

1115
01:22:55,929 --> 01:22:57,514
And my heart sank.

1116
01:22:57,514 --> 01:22:59,099
I just wanted to get out of there.

1117
01:22:59,099 --> 01:23:01,101
I thought, no way we can help her.

1118
01:23:01,101 --> 01:23:03,603
I said, God just take
her life, have mercy.

1119
01:23:03,603 --> 01:23:06,272
Three days shot, no water.

1120
01:23:06,272 --> 01:23:08,233
Three days, not shot, no
water, in 100 something degrees

1121
01:23:08,233 --> 01:23:09,317
in Iraq, you should be dead.

1122
01:23:09,317 --> 01:23:10,694
Maybe in two days.

1123
01:23:10,694 --> 01:23:14,364
Three days, no water, shot in the leg.

1124
01:23:14,364 --> 01:23:15,657
She's alive?

1125
01:23:15,657 --> 01:23:16,992
If we go out to help her,

1126
01:23:16,992 --> 01:23:19,077
ISIS will know now we're
right there in front of them.

1127
01:23:19,077 --> 01:23:20,453
They'll know, they'll kill us.

1128
01:23:20,453 --> 01:23:21,287
They'll kill her.

1129
01:23:21,287 --> 01:23:23,540
They'll come right in that
building kill that little kid,

1130
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:26,835
the girl who's shot, the
disabled boy, the other man,

1131
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:28,044
and my entire team.

1132
01:23:28,044 --> 01:23:29,212
And the Iraqi's, we'll all die.

1133
01:23:29,212 --> 01:23:30,338
What's the point of that?

1134
01:23:30,338 --> 01:23:32,215
There's no human way to do this God.

1135
01:23:32,215 --> 01:23:34,467
It's not just about
courage, it's impossible.

1136
01:23:36,094 --> 01:23:37,595
Just take her God.

1137
01:23:37,595 --> 01:23:39,848
Then I thought, God
you're bigger than that.

1138
01:23:39,848 --> 01:23:41,182
But I don't know what to do.

1139
01:23:41,182 --> 01:23:43,601
So I grab Zuhair's hand
and I just whisper this.

1140
01:23:43,601 --> 01:23:48,023
"God help, God help, in Jesus name."

1141
01:23:49,482 --> 01:23:51,067
And right when I prayed that,

1142
01:23:51,067 --> 01:23:51,901
his eyes go.

1143
01:23:54,195 --> 01:23:55,405
Look at that.

1144
01:23:55,405 --> 01:23:57,866
And we look above us and there's wiring.

1145
01:23:57,866 --> 01:23:58,700
Started pulling the wiring,

1146
01:23:58,700 --> 01:23:59,659
I had my knife and I cut it down,

1147
01:23:59,659 --> 01:24:01,745
and we made 30 meters of wire.

1148
01:24:01,745 --> 01:24:04,038
Which was about how far
she was from us 30 yards.

1149
01:24:04,038 --> 01:24:05,790
And he whispered something in
Arabic to that little girl.

1150
01:24:05,790 --> 01:24:07,459
Who'd be catatonic the whole time.

1151
01:24:08,585 --> 01:24:10,879
She runs out about 15-20 yards.

1152
01:24:11,713 --> 01:24:14,674
ISIS takes two shots
but there's a low wall

1153
01:24:14,674 --> 01:24:16,051
and they must not have
had a good angle on her.

1154
01:24:16,051 --> 01:24:17,886
Probably surprised them.

1155
01:24:17,886 --> 01:24:19,804
She throws the wire out and runs back.

1156
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:23,391
And the woman is laying on her back.

1157
01:24:23,391 --> 01:24:24,642
And I'm just praying she can do this.

1158
01:24:24,642 --> 01:24:27,854
She ties that wire on to
her hand with one arm.

1159
01:24:27,854 --> 01:24:29,564
Three days in the sun and shot.

1160
01:24:29,564 --> 01:24:31,274
She could have the strength to do that.

1161
01:24:31,274 --> 01:24:33,443
I'm just praying Lord, help it hold.

1162
01:24:33,443 --> 01:24:35,403
And then we just pull her in like this.

1163
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:40,950
Hang in there.

1164
01:24:40,950 --> 01:24:42,118
Hang in there.

1165
01:24:49,793 --> 01:24:51,211
Easy, easy, easy.

1166
01:24:56,424 --> 01:24:58,426
As we pulled her up to us she said,

1167
01:24:58,426 --> 01:25:00,345
"God your great, God your great.

1168
01:25:00,345 --> 01:25:02,931
"Thank you, you did not forsake
me when I called on you."

1169
01:25:02,931 --> 01:25:03,807
Then she looked at me and said,

1170
01:25:03,807 --> 01:25:05,892
"Thank you brother, you didn't leave me."

1171
01:25:35,797 --> 01:25:37,131
I came this close to leaving.

1172
01:25:37,131 --> 01:25:38,800
Because I didn't have a
solution. I had no idea.

1173
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:41,052
I wanted her to go to heaven.

1174
01:25:41,052 --> 01:25:42,804
And so, that's why I
go back to that story.

1175
01:25:42,804 --> 01:25:44,013
What's the story?

1176
01:25:44,013 --> 01:25:46,099
The power of evil is so great.

1177
01:25:46,099 --> 01:25:48,184
We are at our limit of courage,

1178
01:25:48,184 --> 01:25:49,978
of ability and it's not enough.

1179
01:25:49,978 --> 01:25:51,980
Even on our best days, not enough.

1180
01:25:51,980 --> 01:25:55,066
But we call on Jesus name,
and he comes right through us,

1181
01:25:55,066 --> 01:25:57,861
and finds a solution and brings good out.

1182
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:07,954
This is Iman.

1183
01:26:12,333 --> 01:26:13,293
They both made it.

1184
01:26:13,293 --> 01:26:14,919
Thank you for making it
the rest of the way, Jesus. Amen.

1185
01:26:16,796 --> 01:26:18,673
Some viewers, if the word Jesus is there,

1186
01:26:18,673 --> 01:26:20,049
which it needs to be there.

1187
01:26:20,049 --> 01:26:23,803
They'll kind of wince, and go
awe, shoot, they ruined it.

1188
01:26:23,803 --> 01:26:25,096
Nutcases.

1189
01:26:25,096 --> 01:26:26,306
But somewhere down the road,

1190
01:26:26,306 --> 01:26:27,724
when they're in trouble.

1191
01:26:27,724 --> 01:26:28,850
They'll remember that.

1192
01:26:30,351 --> 01:26:32,270
And when they're drowning they'll go, oh!

1193
01:26:32,270 --> 01:26:36,816
I got no rope, I wonder if this will work?

1194
01:27:02,342 --> 01:27:04,010
You guys are driving behind ours.

1195
01:27:15,688 --> 01:27:16,689
I think the biggest thing that

1196
01:27:16,689 --> 01:27:19,567
always surprises me about
Mosul, is we're here.

1197
01:27:19,567 --> 01:27:22,487
This is the heart of ISIS.

1198
01:27:22,487 --> 01:27:24,322
And, now we're driving around in it.

1199
01:27:26,574 --> 01:27:28,451
We come back to visit the people we love.

1200
01:27:28,451 --> 01:27:30,286
We helped to rescue.

1201
01:27:30,286 --> 01:27:31,871
And we can follow up on the treatment.

1202
01:27:31,871 --> 01:27:33,456
We can follow up on their lives.

1203
01:27:34,540 --> 01:27:36,709
Whether it's helping
with operations or cost.

1204
01:27:36,709 --> 01:27:38,294
Or getting other people to help.

1205
01:27:41,089 --> 01:27:44,842
If I had to pick one lesson
from the last 24 years.

1206
01:27:44,842 --> 01:27:47,428
The anecdote to evil is love.

1207
01:27:54,435 --> 01:27:55,937
The tank was about right here.

1208
01:27:57,188 --> 01:28:00,984
Ran across here, behind the tank.

1209
01:28:00,984 --> 01:28:03,444
I crossed that line of love.

1210
01:28:03,444 --> 01:28:05,154
Where you give up everything
that's precious to you.

1211
01:28:05,154 --> 01:28:08,533
My own life, my own wife, my own kids.

1212
01:28:08,533 --> 01:28:09,826
I'll never see them again.

1213
01:28:11,536 --> 01:28:15,373
Everything I ever hoped for
I put that away for you.

1214
01:28:23,631 --> 01:28:25,758
It's right, it's love, it's God.

1215
01:28:29,595 --> 01:28:32,181
Once you've given your life out for love,

1216
01:28:33,266 --> 01:28:35,268
you just want to be
with this person again.

1217
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:58,791
You, um, are very strong.

1218
01:29:08,051 --> 01:29:09,969
I'm so happy to see you.

1219
01:29:09,969 --> 01:29:10,803
Can I hold you?

1220
01:29:17,268 --> 01:29:18,936
Tell her she's a very brave girl.

1221
01:29:21,064 --> 01:29:22,315
Here show me the picture.

1222
01:29:26,277 --> 01:29:28,738
The greatest thing we have
in this world is love.

1223
01:29:34,619 --> 01:29:36,788
Love helps you overcome your fears.

1224
01:29:46,964 --> 01:29:48,216
Go!

1225
01:29:49,425 --> 01:29:52,386
- We can see that people do survive.

1226
01:29:52,386 --> 01:29:54,639
There is this continuation of life

1227
01:29:55,640 --> 01:30:00,019
and whatever we're able to
intersect with in that moment

1228
01:30:00,019 --> 01:30:01,854
is what God has for us to do.

1229
01:30:03,106 --> 01:30:07,860
Tell him that I pick up
and he is shot again.

1230
01:30:36,430 --> 01:30:39,058
This is the medic from
Burma named Slowly.

1231
01:30:39,058 --> 01:30:40,017
He is with you.

1232
01:30:44,439 --> 01:30:46,816
When they see you alive
they will be very happy.

1233
01:31:22,435 --> 01:31:27,356
Sheheen's memorial playground
close where he died in Mosul.

1234
01:31:34,655 --> 01:31:36,282
General Mustafa came back.

1235
01:31:36,282 --> 01:31:39,035
The same Iraqi Commander said,
"Do you know I was praying

1236
01:31:39,035 --> 01:31:41,120
"for God to help and look what he sent?

1237
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:43,080
"An American Christian to help me.

1238
01:31:44,081 --> 01:31:45,291
"But I know he sent you.

1239
01:31:46,959 --> 01:31:49,170
"And when you go home, tell the American's

1240
01:31:49,170 --> 01:31:53,299
"thank you for showing us what
it means to follow Jesus."

1241
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:38,386
- Was it worth it to get into
this wild and crazy life?

1242
01:32:38,386 --> 01:32:40,596
Oh, 100%, I wouldn't go back a day.

1243
01:32:40,596 --> 01:32:41,931
I am so thankful.

1244
01:32:43,849 --> 01:32:47,561
I have had my most profound times.

1245
01:32:47,561 --> 01:32:50,439
Where everything is just
right there on the edge.

1246
01:32:50,439 --> 01:32:52,608
And yet, God's hand is almost visible.

1247
01:33:23,264 --> 01:33:26,142
- The results of the work we've been

1248
01:33:26,142 --> 01:33:28,019
doing the last 24 years.

1249
01:33:28,978 --> 01:33:30,688
To go where things are difficult.

1250
01:33:30,688 --> 01:33:32,815
Help people who are in need.

1251
01:33:32,815 --> 01:33:36,777
Has been a deep satisfaction and gratitude

1252
01:33:36,777 --> 01:33:38,946
that I'm doing what I was made to do.

1253
01:33:40,573 --> 01:33:43,743
We gotta be part of life, of love!

1254
01:33:50,416 --> 01:33:51,917
I don't know how to describe that feeling

1255
01:33:51,917 --> 01:33:54,170
other than gratitude.

1256
01:33:54,170 --> 01:33:55,004
It's gratitude.

1257
01:33:57,548 --> 01:33:58,799
Thank you, God.
