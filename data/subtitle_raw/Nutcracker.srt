1
00:05:47,216 --> 00:05:49,436
Christmas long ago

2
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:53,527
is the memory of a dream
that seemed never to end.

3
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:57,313
But somewhere in the middle of that dream,
I always did wake up

4
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,011
just in time to attend
the Christmas Eve party

5
00:06:00,055 --> 00:06:03,580
my Mama and Papa gave for me and my brother, Fritz.

6
00:06:03,624 --> 00:06:07,062
Mama attracted
interesting guests Papa said,

7
00:06:07,105 --> 00:06:09,499
because she was beautiful
and fascinating.

8
00:06:09,543 --> 00:06:13,242
She was, he said,
his wondrous peacock.

9
00:06:13,285 --> 00:06:16,027
How full
of anticipation I was.

10
00:06:16,071 --> 00:06:18,552
"Dreamers need not be pretty,"

11
00:06:18,595 --> 00:06:22,469
my godfather, Drosselmeier
told me so very long ago.

12
00:06:22,512 --> 00:06:26,603
My good, and, sometimes,
very bad, godfather, Drosselmeier

13
00:06:26,647 --> 00:06:31,347
was certainly the very strangest guest at those long-ago parties.

14
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,480
He was a genius, they said.

15
00:06:33,523 --> 00:06:39,137
So it was especially strange to me that he behaved like a silly little boy.

16
00:06:39,181 --> 00:06:40,791
And often, he frightened me.

17
00:06:40,835 --> 00:06:44,447
But more often,
and this is strangest of all,

18
00:06:44,491 --> 00:06:47,494
I loved him
better than anyone.

19
00:06:47,537 --> 00:06:50,061
And I loved
his presents best of all.

20
00:06:50,105 --> 00:06:53,848
For besides being a genius,
he was a very famous clockmaker

21
00:06:53,891 --> 00:06:57,025
and toymaker
and mouse catcher.

22
00:06:57,068 --> 00:07:00,507
Dreams, like all
my most precious gifts,

23
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:03,945
were from my dear godfather, Drosselmeier.

24
00:07:03,988 --> 00:07:08,689
When I loved him,
he was the kindest creature you can imagine.

25
00:07:08,732 --> 00:07:12,649
He told me stories,
every word of which I still remember.

26
00:07:12,693 --> 00:07:17,175
But when he frightened me with his weird and childish ways,

27
00:07:17,219 --> 00:07:19,874
and I could not bear
for him to be near me,

28
00:07:19,917 --> 00:07:21,702
he would punish me.

29
00:07:21,745 --> 00:07:25,880
It was on such an occasion,
when I was nearly 13 years old,

30
00:07:25,923 --> 00:07:29,274
on Christmas Eve,
that out of spite,

31
00:07:29,318 --> 00:07:33,583
Godfather Drosselmeier gave me
the most wicked dream.

32
00:07:33,627 --> 00:07:35,716
I smile to think of it now,

33
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:41,330
that a nightmare could bring,
like a sweet memory, such a strange joy.

34
00:07:41,373 --> 00:07:43,767
It is a mystery
I can never solve.

35
00:07:43,811 --> 00:07:49,120
But I can never forgive my spiteful godfather for slipping into that dream

36
00:07:49,164 --> 00:07:51,427
my bad little brother, Fritz.

37
00:13:24,978 --> 00:13:27,545
The Christmas parties
of long ago

38
00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:30,461
all blur and mix in memory.

39
00:13:30,505 --> 00:13:33,769
The real and the unreal becomes one.

40
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,467
How silly
we children appeared.

41
00:13:36,511 --> 00:13:41,472
Gawking and gaping at the Grand Promenade of our mamas and papas.

42
00:13:41,516 --> 00:13:44,519
I will never forget
the envy and delight I felt

43
00:13:44,562 --> 00:13:46,521
at watching my parents.

44
00:13:46,564 --> 00:13:50,046
And how badly I longed to dance with my beautiful Papa.

45
00:13:52,353 --> 00:13:56,748
How my head whirled with the music and buzzed with my bad dream,

46
00:13:56,792 --> 00:13:58,838
not cold enough yet
for me to forget.

47
00:14:01,362 --> 00:14:05,670
And Godfather Drosselmeier
wasn't even there.

48
00:14:05,714 --> 00:14:10,893
The party was incomplete without him and all his wonderful presents.

49
00:48:06,971 --> 00:48:10,931
In that long-ago dream
in an ocean wide with mystery,

50
00:48:10,975 --> 00:48:15,327
my heart beat
with joy and fear all mixed.

51
00:48:15,370 --> 00:48:20,114
But odd to say,
I knew this dreamscape.

52
00:48:20,158 --> 00:48:23,422
Dreams
are strangely familiar places.

53
00:48:23,465 --> 00:48:25,946
They are, not at all,
the land of make-believe,

54
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:28,818
but only the home
lay inside of yourself,

55
00:48:28,862 --> 00:48:31,821
like the inner lining
of your favorite coat

56
00:48:31,865 --> 00:48:34,781
or the sweet kernel
inside the hardest nut

57
00:48:34,824 --> 00:48:39,699
that only the jaws of my Nutcracker Prince,
could reveal to me.

58
00:53:30,424 --> 00:53:33,427
In the language
of this dream,

59
00:53:33,471 --> 00:53:35,908
in that palace of delight,

60
00:53:35,951 --> 00:53:38,911
we spoke with
our whole selves.

61
00:53:38,954 --> 00:53:41,827
We dream-talked
with hands and feet,

62
00:53:41,870 --> 00:53:45,483
and quick-danced
out our mousey Christmas tale.

63
00:53:45,526 --> 00:53:50,270
And they joined us in a celebration in that palace by the sea.

64
00:53:50,314 --> 00:53:56,276
And my tall Nutcracker cavalier had eyes only for me.

65
00:53:56,320 --> 00:54:00,280
For at least as long as that dream could be.
