1
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,414
Move... Hurry

2
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:27,156
Commander-in-chief

3
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:30,588
What?

4
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:32,197
We arrested another
ten illegal salt venders

5
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:37,692
God damn it! Take care of it as usual

6
00:00:37,837 --> 00:00:40,101
Put them in the torture chamber

7
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,366
Interrogate them and kill them after

8
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:42,304
Yes, sir

9
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,646
They dare to sell salt on my turf!

10
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:53,945
Isn't life dear to you!

11
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:58,115
I'm scared when you even talk of killing

12
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:00,184
What are you afraid of?

13
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,462
Didn't you used to sell illegal salt

14
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:07,828
Shit! Shave my head!

15
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,700
Yes, I did

16
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,505
The salt is from the ocean

17
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:17,872
And the hard work of the people

18
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,007
There is no difference
if its legal or illegal

19
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:23,339
From the period of Cuen Chew

20
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:27,613
The sale belongs to the government

21
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,847
This monopoly system continues until now

22
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:33,288
The legal one is called Government salt

23
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:36,418
Without permission it's illegal

24
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:39,225
But in the Chin Dynasty
there was corruption

25
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:41,663
Some of the officers kept the profits

26
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:43,928
It was a great deal

27
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,800
They stole government salt

28
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:49,002
There is no cost or tax

29
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:50,837
That kind of salt is illegal

30
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:53,436
It's against the law to sell it

31
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,208
It's the death penalty if you get caught

32
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:59,411
Still there are people taking the risk

33
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,543
Because of the good profit

34
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:06,355
Over here! Chou Ju

35
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:10,523
Din Wei, it's time to eat

36
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,832
It smells so good

37
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,606
Hurry up! You have to work harder

38
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,975
It's best to work for the Government

39
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:29,181
I'd rather be my own boss

40
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,578
I'd rather sell illegal salt

41
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:33,350
What?

42
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,444
That's great!

43
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:39,718
One is a thief and another is the police

44
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:42,428
Three of us are like brothers

45
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:45,395
We're working together side by side

46
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:48,166
We can barely afford three meals a day

47
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:51,293
That's all we dare to ask for

48
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:54,638
We need to help each other

49
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:57,436
Let's swear to be good brothers

50
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:58,669
Joining in the Royal secret societies

51
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,957
Kneel down!

52
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,951
The candles are above your head

53
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:51,063
There are heroes among us

54
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:53,028
Flying like birds

55
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,827
Fighting like dragons

56
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:56,658
Two pairs of candles on the table

57
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:58,896
Shining above all of us

58
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:01,336
It will always take care of us

59
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:03,840
And last forever

60
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:06,302
The candles and flowers

61
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:08,573
Put them in between

62
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:10,706
Since our ancestors

63
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,080
We're from the same family

64
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,360
All for one and one for all

65
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:29,366
We'll be able to handle anything

66
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:32,994
No one can beat us

67
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:35,131
After we took the vow to a secret group

68
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:38,472
Brother Pei and I became dealers

69
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:40,878
Ly Chen Piao joined the force

70
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:42,641
He was in charge of illegal dealing

71
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,606
Three of us divided to two sides

72
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:47,276
He worked for the Government

73
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:50,251
At the beginning he gave us a break

74
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,551
He wouldn't give us too much trouble

75
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:55,920
But after Brother Pei got sick and died

76
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:57,654
He didn't consider
the relationship any more

77
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:00,229
Between the coast where the salt is made

78
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:02,163
and the Northern wilderness;

79
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,862
There are many check points...

80
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:07,363
which you can't avoid or detour

81
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:09,236
One's got to pay them off

82
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,899
Say, if they wouldn't take the bribe...

83
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:13,171
You have to fight your way through

84
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,780
It's very dangerous

85
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:21,077
Stop...

86
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:23,748
Are you selling illegal salt?

87
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,592
Are you?

88
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:31,161
Speak up!

89
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:33,631
No, it's Government salt

90
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:35,593
Are you sure? Tell me the truth

91
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:36,929
I'm asking you

92
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:40,036
Is it illegal salt?

93
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,071
It's white!

94
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:43,605
I don't care whether it's white or black

95
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:45,677
I only want to know if it's legal or not?

96
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:46,876
Of course it's legal

97
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:47,945
Do you have a permission slip?

98
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:48,979
Yes

99
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:50,104
Let me see

100
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:52,785
Hurry up!

101
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,378
Ma'am

102
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,914
You can give bills instead of slips

103
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:09,562
You're Brother Pei's widow

104
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,197
Why didn't you say earlier?

105
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:13,430
Shit!

106
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:21,072
She is one hell of a lady

107
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:19,366
Brother Pei was our leader

108
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:21,302
Since he died his wife took over

109
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:23,469
She has been very nice to me

110
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,600
She won't remarry and I'm single

111
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:29,114
We love each other

112
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:31,375
We are a couple

113
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:32,814
Just no ceremony

114
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,680
She didn't want to get married again

115
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:37,289
It's for all of us

116
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:38,816
There are seven or eight hundred people

117
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,426
With their families
it must be around 7 thousand

118
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:44,661
We can't live without her leadership

119
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:49,265
She is the chief of our team

120
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:50,596
And I'm one of her aides

121
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:54,571
There are four officers who work for me

122
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:57,369
Four Jin Piao -dart experts

123
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,307
They are Dong, Chu, Ko and Ce

124
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:01,276
The best of the best

125
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:03,478
Is the boss in?

126
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:05,379
Yes...

127
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:06,677
Is he?

128
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,047
Yes

129
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:12,748
Are you ready?

130
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:14,120
Yes, everything is ready

131
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:16,088
Hurry up!

132
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,327
It's all here

133
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:24,564
Damn!

134
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:27,070
We work our butt off
and have to share with them

135
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:34,810
Hurry... watch this

136
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:08,145
Shoot

137
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:09,270
Yes

138
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:17,681
Come on

139
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:19,953
Get the boat closer

140
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:31,363
Who is your leader?

141
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:32,695
Me, Dong Jin Piao

142
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:33,327
He is the leader

143
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:34,837
It's Dong Jin Piao

144
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:38,332
I've heard about you before

145
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:40,138
Yes...

146
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:43,345
This time Brother Pei's widow didn't come

147
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:44,847
She retired long time ago

148
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:46,315
This is a small case

149
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:48,613
We don't need to bother her

150
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:50,721
Where is the shipping list?

151
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:52,016
Here you are...

152
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:01,226
Sir...

153
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:04,962
The list

154
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:22,315
The General is here

155
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:32,021
How are you? Sir

156
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:38,961
Mr. Commander

157
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:41,102
Did you check it? How many are there?

158
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,731
Yes. There are 560 sacks

159
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:45,673
All of them have been stamped with a chop

160
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:50,879
In the book it just mentions 160

161
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:52,541
The rest of it will be confiscated

162
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:53,083
But...

163
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:53,776
What's wrong?

164
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:54,385
Confiscate it

165
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,509
Yes

166
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:59,114
Who was shooting?

167
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:02,159
It's a false alarm

168
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:02,817
False alarm?

169
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:04,930
Yes... there were whole bunch of them
on the boat

170
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:07,089
Someone shot accidentally

171
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:09,292
I thought that they were resisting arrest

172
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:11,767
...so I told my men to shoot

173
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:15,232
What do you get from them?

174
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:16,898
Nothing!

175
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:18,601
Really?

176
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:23,110
Listen, tell the tiger Xu
and the window Pei

177
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:26,082
The confiscated salt
is paying the penalty

178
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:28,482
Otherwise I will close down all of you

179
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:29,087
Yes...

180
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:30,279
I'm just doing my job

181
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:32,249
Remember it

182
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:35,958
Good bye! Commander

183
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:37,525
That's it

184
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,367
We have to get rid of him

185
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:50,433
Dong contacted his uncle

186
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:53,306
He is the secretary of
Transportation Department

187
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:57,575
I hear, the Chief didn't like
Ly Cen Piao either

188
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:58,615
My sister-in-law

189
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:01,618
My uncle suggests
we should bribe the Chief

190
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:03,119
to accuse Ly Chen Piao of something

191
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:04,187
What should we accuse him of?

192
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:06,549
He is stealing money

193
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:08,751
That's not enough. Add something else

194
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:11,627
He colluded with the salt dealers

195
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:27,079
Please sit down

196
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:31,874
No formalities.
Let's sit down and discuss it

197
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,381
When did you arrive?

198
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:40,083
At noon. I'm here to report right away

199
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:45,455
I got information about you recently

200
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,998
Someone tried to set you up

201
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:52,568
But you have to consider my situation

202
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:54,863
Don't blame me; I can't really help

203
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:56,065
You're too kind

204
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,903
I understand completely

205
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:00,170
It's that Pei widow after my back

206
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:02,837
She persuaded the Governor to accuse me

207
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:07,248
You're a fair person.
I trust your judgment

208
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:09,013
That's great

209
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:13,049
Did you just mention the widow of Pei?

210
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:15,592
What kind of person is she?

211
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:19,387
She is a salt dealer.
Her name is Pei Chou Ju

212
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,491
A salt dealer, huh?

213
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,364
Everyone on Nanjing waterfront
knows about it

214
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:27,836
The toughest dealer is Xu Pao Shan

215
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,941
No one dares to utter
his nick-name; the "Tiger"

216
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:31,235
So they called him Pao Shan

217
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:35,036
The widow Pei
is the real leader of the group

218
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:37,706
Tiger Xu is just her...

219
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:38,845
Her...

220
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,008
He is her helper

221
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,619
Yes, one of the aides

222
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:45,087
The widow is very nice to Tiger Xu

223
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:47,818
She is helping him
and lets him handle the work

224
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:52,458
They are all the same

225
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,064
All this is unavoidable

226
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,999
They hate the anti-smuggling officers

227
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,375
If I still assigned you to the job...

228
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,673
to be the chief of Young Chou City;

229
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,206
What are you going to do about widow Pei?

230
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:13,813
I'll warn them before I arrest them

231
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:16,547
Give them a chance to surrender

232
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,554
Nothing personal;
just discharging official duty

233
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:23,689
Last year we lost the war
with the Japanese

234
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:28,255
Ly Chong Tan signed the Ma Kwan agreement

235
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,800
The compensation is hundreds of millions

236
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:35,202
Plus 30 million to get back
Liao Dong Peninsula

237
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,800
The first payment of 50 million...

238
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:41,504
is due in September

239
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:46,741
Where will the money come from?

240
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,519
We've got to mete out
largest part of compensation

241
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:54,285
The only way for us is by collecting tax

242
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:57,953
And try our best to settle

243
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:01,356
So you must continue dealing with
the smugglers

244
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,469
Be more firm and strict than before!

245
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:08,105
Don't worry! You have my backing

246
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,461
Mrs. Pei is here

247
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,799
Mrs. Pei?

248
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:19,033
I don't want to see her. Why is she here?

249
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:27,382
I heard that he got a promotion

250
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,510
I'm here to congratulate him

251
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:33,050
This is a wonderful pen

252
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:36,826
It's not the best
but the carving is beautiful

253
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:41,090
And this is for you

254
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:42,165
Imported cloth from Shanghai

255
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:45,361
These are for the kids to play with

256
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:58,112
It's too bad that he is not at home

257
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,515
I would really like to congratulate him

258
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:05,651
It's not easy to be a government officer

259
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,786
There are many friends here

260
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:10,520
I heard Chen Piao
wanted to go into business

261
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:14,688
You should take this pen back

262
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:17,931
You'll need it in the future

263
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,901
No one is satisfied with their job

264
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:23,133
It's not easy to keep up with business

265
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:25,766
Please tell our third brother

266
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:29,472
There is no problem. Please don't worry

267
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:31,810
I won't put him in a difficult situation

268
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,285
I'll leave now. Sorry to bother you

269
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:37,816
Why don't you stay for dinner?

270
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:41,153
Our brother is coming home.
I shouldn't be here

271
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:59,169
We'll teach him a lesson
if he doesn't agree with us

272
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:00,300
Yes, teach him a lesson

273
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:04,242
Yes, give him something to remember

274
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:30,101
Stupid, all of them are idiots

275
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,900
Ly Chen Piao has been recruiting people

276
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:35,377
He'll train them to be the best soldiers

277
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:38,039
They'll arrest us when they are ready

278
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:40,242
Then we won't have a chance

279
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,654
Hurry up...

280
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:00,193
Get ready

281
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,099
Release it

282
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:06,003
We can't wait here and let them...

283
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,510
either die or go to jail

284
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:09,013
Hold on

285
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:13,048
Attention

286
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:57,227
Let's go...

287
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:04,528
New officers always work harder

288
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:06,734
Looks like he is trying to
prove something

289
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,272
It won't be pretty.
We need to calm things down

290
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:10,837
How do we do that?

291
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:14,377
Let's ask the Fifth Lord a favor.
He'll solve it

292
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:16,845
There are three respectful people
in Young Chou

293
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:18,574
In the seniority of vagrants
he is the oldest one

294
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:21,785
With his position...

295
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,218
he should be able to take care of it

296
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:25,755
He'll think through this matter

297
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,753
What if he doesn't go our way;

298
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,327
Then what should we do?

299
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,727
All of this is for our brothers

300
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:39,729
We have to work to pay for our living

301
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:40,735
If we don't have an income,
how do we live?

302
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:44,103
Can we leave them alone?

303
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,473
Everyone goes their own way

304
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:48,512
And we don't get involved

305
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:50,946
Do you think either you or I can do it?

306
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,750
I don't think it's so serious

307
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:56,183
Do you remember fifth lord's
only daughter

308
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:57,754
Jin Mei and what happened with
Lo Xio Mou!

309
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:00,250
The little potato Lo Xio Mou?

310
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:02,952
Yes, he wanted to marry Jin Mei

311
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,791
The fifth Lord got so mad and scolded him

312
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:07,291
But he couldn't believe

313
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:10,060
She was pregnant

314
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:13,036
Are you? Tell me! Is it true?

315
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:16,199
I've told you already

316
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:19,504
I don't know. I really don't know

317
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:20,778
You...

318
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:23,340
Fifth Brother

319
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:26,946
Fifth Brother, take it easy!

320
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:29,053
It's all my fault
because I'm not strict with you

321
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:30,552
You really embarrassed me

322
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:32,247
Just go to hell!

323
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:33,689
Stop there

324
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:37,552
Where are you going?

325
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:39,261
Didn't you tell me to go to hell?

326
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:41,662
All right, go ahead

327
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:45,700
I'll kill you

328
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:47,236
Fifth Brother... please calm down

329
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:48,339
Fifth Brother... don't hit her anymore

330
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,100
Please...

331
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:51,971
You should die

332
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:55,907
Yes, I don't have mother.
No one cares about me

333
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:59,017
Anyone can hurt me

334
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:03,144
Mom...

335
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:14,392
Fifth Brother, you are too much

336
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:17,058
She is two months pregnant

337
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:24,440
We should find a solution

338
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:25,634
Yes

339
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:29,579
Jin Mei, you have to consider your dad

340
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:32,843
His social position is very respectful

341
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:36,078
As his family you should think for him

342
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:37,848
Then why don't you give me an idea?

343
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:39,954
What idea can I come up with now?

344
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:41,150
I'm not afraid to die

345
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:42,521
It'll make it worse

346
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:44,492
How can your dad face others?

347
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:45,527
You're right!

348
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:48,622
My sister-in-law,
please give me a good advice

349
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:56,800
Alright, ask Jin Mei to accompany you
to Shanghai

350
00:22:56,942 --> 00:22:58,136
You can stay at your place first

351
00:22:58,276 --> 00:23:00,801
As it is, you just said you needed a break

352
00:23:00,946 --> 00:23:02,777
Look for a good doctor

353
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:05,178
Have an abortion

354
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:06,909
This matter can't be delayed

355
00:23:07,652 --> 00:23:11,713
Sister-in-law, two women on a trip

356
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,659
Would you please help us?

357
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:18,092
Send someone with us

358
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:22,465
Don't let too many people know about it

359
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,128
I'll send Xio Chou to accompany you

360
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:27,203
Xio Chou?

361
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:30,766
My cousin. He won't leak the secret

362
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:31,898
Chong Hua is here

363
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:32,641
Cousin

364
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:34,712
Chong Hua, this is auntie Suen

365
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:35,813
Auntie Suen

366
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:36,743
Oh, please!

367
00:23:38,283 --> 00:23:39,910
Chong Hua, this is Jin Mei

368
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:44,246
Jin Mei

369
00:23:45,223 --> 00:23:46,281
When Jin Mei reached Shanghai

370
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,586
She found a doctor to have an abortion

371
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,925
She felt so grateful to Xio Chou...

372
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:52,586
she wanted to marry him

373
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:55,693
The fifth Lord knew this

374
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:58,635
But he tried not to pay attention

375
00:23:59,237 --> 00:24:02,638
We need to go to the
Anti-corruption office

376
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:04,302
I already arranged to see someone for info

377
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:05,375
I'll go to see him.
We both are from same town

378
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:06,272
I helped him to borrow 100 dollars

379
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:08,436
He needed the money to go to Nanjing

380
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:11,482
This time it's different though

381
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,880
He is very busy

382
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:15,611
Because of his relationship
with Ly Chen Piao

383
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:21,550
I heard Commander Ly is getting promoted

384
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:23,292
We should throw him a party

385
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:26,426
Commander Ly refused all the gifts

386
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:28,499
He said this time it was business

387
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:32,262
He will upset many people

388
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:33,695
There is nothing to celebrate

389
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:37,338
The word is, many would die at his hands

390
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:38,807
Really?

391
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:41,568
It could merely be a rumor

392
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,781
I'm afraid that it's probably true

393
00:24:45,116 --> 00:24:48,950
The Governor has ordered him to

394
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:53,888
He has no choice but to follow the order

395
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:54,855
That's true

396
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,483
His superiors
take severe disciplinary measures

397
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:58,425
The Commander has to do the same

398
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,525
The superiors want arrests

399
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:02,360
The Commander has to find them

400
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:03,866
There is no other way!

401
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:06,061
Yes...

402
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:07,465
Excuse me

403
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:08,937
I need to go inside

404
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:10,541
We'll come to see you some other time

405
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,267
This is a little token

406
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:14,002
Thank you...

407
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:17,882
Those servants are really...

408
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:21,343
You said there was only one alternative

409
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:27,151
There's a saying you swallow
whatever you put in

410
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:28,725
Are you saying...

411
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:33,727
You're responsible for what you did

412
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:35,457
Yes

413
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,259
What did you say?

414
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:37,493
Um, I...

415
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:41,335
Those people who follow Din Wei

416
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:44,203
They address Pao Shan as "boss"

417
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:48,642
But I'm still the person in charge

418
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:56,148
This is no good for Pao Shan

419
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:58,119
They will say that
Xu Pao Shan is chicken shit

420
00:25:58,256 --> 00:25:59,348
And that, he is not good enough

421
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:03,918
Everyone knows that
Pao Shan is not a coward

422
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:07,064
The last couple of years

423
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:09,926
I tried to let Pao Shan take over

424
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:13,069
I wanted him to take over the burden

425
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:16,604
Then I could take it easy
and enjoy my life

426
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:19,340
I haven't been out for a while

427
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:21,968
And if Pao Shan is not there

428
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:25,582
I have to take all the responsibility

429
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:28,117
And if I cannot do it right...

430
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:30,118
Those subordinates will have to leave

431
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,883
They'll have to work
in those slimy places

432
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:36,221
Fifth Lord,
I don't think that you'll like it

433
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:38,158
They will come to bother you all the time

434
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:42,399
I think

435
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:44,668
If Pao Shan is in charge

436
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:47,601
Sheng Xio Lo wouldn't stand a chance

437
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:49,798
If I take control...

438
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:51,966
I can keep 7 or 8 hundred people

439
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,374
We can maintain ourselves

440
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:58,312
It's not the best situation
but it's alright

441
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:09,189
Fifth Lord, please allow me to do this

442
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:11,560
Please get up...

443
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:13,186
I promise you

444
00:27:13,331 --> 00:27:17,495
Be quick... get up

445
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:29,043
I thought there was no one here

446
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:31,541
Dad is here and Sister-in-law Pei

447
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:35,942
You're always ever so pretty

448
00:27:36,354 --> 00:27:38,822
Last time you were here

449
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:40,049
I was riding on my horse
but I couldn't concentrate

450
00:27:40,191 --> 00:27:42,386
I thought there was something
going on at home

451
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:44,392
I rushed home and found you here

452
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:45,996
Isn't that strange?

453
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:48,531
It's not strange
because we like each other

454
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:49,565
Sister-in-law Pei

455
00:27:53,638 --> 00:27:55,333
Sister-in-law Pei, about this matter...

456
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:57,839
It stays between you and me

457
00:27:57,976 --> 00:28:00,638
I'll reply to you in a couple of days

458
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:01,768
Relax!

459
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:05,509
Don't let Pao Shan know

460
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:06,116
I mean, his temper...

461
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:07,616
Yes...

462
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,571
What did it say in the documents?

463
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:51,357
They didn't have any specifications

464
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:58,026
It's only the name of criminals

465
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:01,435
Chen Piao, the General has told you

466
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,268
You should know how many there are

467
00:29:05,343 --> 00:29:06,002
What's wrong?

468
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:07,975
You wouldn't even tell us

469
00:29:08,346 --> 00:29:09,040
How many?

470
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:11,480
Six of them

471
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:15,515
You have to arrest all of them

472
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:17,120
It has been addressed in the document

473
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:19,223
If anyone resists you can kill them

474
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:22,718
How can you take this job? Chen Piao

475
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:23,885
It's a tough one

476
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:27,462
Uncle, I had no choice

477
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:29,431
Please forgive me

478
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,236
Is there any other way? Chen Piao

479
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:34,361
Can you not kill them?

480
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:37,031
We can't let the robbers run free

481
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:38,340
Selling illegal salt

482
00:29:38,476 --> 00:29:41,070
Can you give them a chance?

483
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:45,075
Yes, I've been trying to tell the General

484
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:47,047
But he asked me a question

485
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:48,584
I didn't dare be persistent

486
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:52,085
What did he ask? Please tell me

487
00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:55,223
He said to me

488
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,557
Would you be able to ask them to promise;

489
00:29:58,696 --> 00:30:01,324
From now on, in this area...

490
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:02,558
there will be no more illegal salt

491
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,260
What a joke! Who dares to guarantee?

492
00:30:05,403 --> 00:30:07,769
My luck is no good

493
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:10,397
He wants them dead and I have to do it

494
00:30:11,442 --> 00:30:13,433
Say, how about
if you don't kill all of them!

495
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:15,170
We just find one to be a scapegoat

496
00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:16,779
Who would it be?

497
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:19,282
Xu Pao Shan

498
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:21,741
Without Xu Pao Shan

499
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:23,945
What will the rest of us do?

500
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:25,020
No more illegal salt

501
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:26,623
Should we rob households instead?

502
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:29,158
Then you will have more to deal with

503
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,485
Can we just give you the widow Pei?

504
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:35,430
Did she volunteer?

505
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:39,368
Could we force her if she disagreed?

506
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,768
We have over 200 years between us

507
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:43,305
Would we bullshit you here?

508
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:46,342
We're making a great play

509
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:48,274
The criminal agreed to confess

510
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:51,644
It's your call now

511
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,884
Yes. Please don't get mad, Uncle

512
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:56,008
I was too rude

513
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:57,451
No need to bullshit. Chen Piao

514
00:30:57,589 --> 00:30:59,386
There is only one question

515
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,458
Will this arrangement solve it?

516
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:04,052
Well...

517
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:06,186
Will it work?

518
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:15,272
Then I'll tell Mr. Liu

519
00:31:15,406 --> 00:31:16,964
They all escaped except one

520
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:18,132
No more trouble?

521
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:22,640
They'd better behave

522
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:26,443
Otherwise I don't think I can cover them

523
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:31,319
Chen Piao is trying his best. Brother

524
00:31:31,456 --> 00:31:33,481
You'll have to tell Pao Shan later

525
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:36,689
The widow Pei will be the hero among us

526
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:38,352
Pao Shan becomes the coward

527
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,789
It's all up to you to be hero or a coward

528
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:43,162
You need to face it
even if it's difficult

529
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:02,710
What's wrong with you?

530
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:05,922
I'm going to ask you right now

531
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:09,751
What happened?
Second Lord told me about it

532
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:11,959
Why didn't you discuss it with me first?

533
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,454
You gave yourself in

534
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:14,724
and embarrassed me!

535
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:17,058
It's not your business

536
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:19,863
Their first target was me

537
00:32:20,004 --> 00:32:22,939
I'm guilty! It's not your problem

538
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:24,632
Why did it embarrass you?

539
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:28,741
All right, maybe you're the first one

540
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,211
The next will be me

541
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:31,178
You're guilty

542
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:32,510
I'm also guilty

543
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:39,156
Don't be a fool! Pao Shan

544
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:42,687
I'm not doing this for you

545
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:44,419
It's for my own good

546
00:32:45,196 --> 00:32:48,029
Just for the sake of our past

547
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,561
Please listen to me

548
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:52,301
You are not doing this only for yourself

549
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:54,366
I understand it's also for me

550
00:32:54,505 --> 00:32:56,336
But I don't appreciate
your way of doing things

551
00:32:56,941 --> 00:32:58,306
You made me the bad guy

552
00:32:58,443 --> 00:32:59,501
I'll go talk to Ly Chen Piao

553
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:00,775
Pao Shan

554
00:33:03,948 --> 00:33:05,074
What are you going to say?

555
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:08,276
The same deal but I'll go instead of you

556
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:09,651
Pao Shan

557
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:15,816
It doesn't matter who goes to surrender

558
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,393
This is our own decision

559
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,625
It doesn't mean that
the court will accept

560
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:21,697
We haven't got an answer

561
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:23,523
They will reply to us later

562
00:33:25,236 --> 00:33:26,203
That's all right

563
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:29,431
Let's wait for Jin Mei
and Xio Chou's wedding

564
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:31,166
We'll decide after they set a date

565
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:38,076
Fine then! I'll take your word

566
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:40,810
But I have one request

567
00:33:43,654 --> 00:33:47,420
Go ahead! I'll promise you anything

568
00:33:54,732 --> 00:33:55,756
Did you sew it?

569
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,127
It's not very nice,
please don't laugh at me

570
00:33:58,903 --> 00:34:01,497
It's admirable; I dare not mock you

571
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:03,598
Can I show you more?

572
00:34:10,248 --> 00:34:11,715
This is called Blossoms of wealth

573
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:12,941
Very good

574
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:17,412
The flowers blossom and Spring is coming

575
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:21,919
You'll be a great couple

576
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:23,587
When is your birthday?

577
00:34:23,861 --> 00:34:24,953
I was born on the Double Ninth Festival

578
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:25,994
As per lunar calendar it's September 9th

579
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,461
What time?

580
00:34:27,598 --> 00:34:28,360
What for?

581
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:31,760
It's a lucky day

582
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,962
Yes, I checked the calendar

583
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:36,039
It's a good day to get married

584
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:37,971
Also it's Jin Mei's birthday

585
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:40,270
We can choose that day

586
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:41,844
If everything is set

587
00:34:41,979 --> 00:34:43,571
We can have the wedding
before the year ends

588
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:47,249
I'll try to arrange it for Chong Hua

589
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,210
Would it be too hurried?

590
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:04,401
I'm afraid that I won't be free to wait

591
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:16,508
After all it's a happy occasion;
sooner is better

592
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:19,306
That's all right!

593
00:35:30,194 --> 00:35:31,957
Don't worry! Sister-in-law

594
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:33,859
I'll try my best to handle it

595
00:35:34,832 --> 00:35:36,766
When is it coming?

596
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:38,533
It depends on you

597
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:43,805
I want to take care of
my cousin's wedding

598
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:48,269
Tell me the date when you're ready

599
00:35:48,412 --> 00:35:49,276
Pao Shan is here

600
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:52,216
You hide first

601
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:02,590
You got a promotion, my dear brother

602
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:04,422
I haven't had a chance
to congratulate you

603
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:06,861
Oh, come on now, Brother Pao Shan

604
00:36:07,598 --> 00:36:09,623
Okay then, let me be honest

605
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:12,760
How can you and Chou Ju...

606
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:15,099
make decisions behind my back

607
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:19,406
Well, I didn't know she hadn't told you

608
00:36:20,545 --> 00:36:22,638
You made me look like a fool

609
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:24,943
I can't let her take my place

610
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:27,050
And help me hide

611
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:29,080
I'd be too embarrassed

612
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,051
How can I go on living?

613
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:32,578
But...

614
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:34,816
No more talking

615
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:37,928
The same deal but I'll go instead of her

616
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:43,492
All right, honor is more important

617
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:44,498
I promised you

618
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:46,032
You set a date

619
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:48,502
I'll come. The sooner the better

620
00:36:49,273 --> 00:36:50,240
How about tomorrow?

621
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:56,539
I heard that Xio Chou is engaged

622
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:00,581
We can wait until the wedding

623
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:02,210
That's a long time

624
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:04,084
I have work to attend to

625
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:07,483
It's a deal. I'll wait for you

626
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,250
All right

627
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:14,258
Be it to share sorrow or joy

628
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,229
We can't let our big brother
take everything

629
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:17,356
Yes, it's not right

630
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:19,935
What if the government
breaks its promise,

631
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,800
Or pushed for more

632
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:24,703
One is not enough!
They will arrest more

633
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:26,639
They will want to get all of us later

634
00:37:26,777 --> 00:37:27,300
What should we do?

635
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:29,777
Tell them to get ready

636
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:32,439
We'll fight back if there is any action

637
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:33,572
Yes

638
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:35,282
Why should we surrender to them?

639
00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:37,020
Am I right?

640
00:37:37,154 --> 00:37:37,882
Yes, he is right

641
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:38,989
No

642
00:37:41,158 --> 00:37:42,216
Sister-in-law

643
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,554
According my experience

644
00:37:43,694 --> 00:37:47,130
Mr. Ly will follow through his orders

645
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:51,126
Even if we fight back...

646
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,793
we won't be able to run away

647
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:56,331
We should make a plan

648
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:58,570
If Pao Shan gives himself up

649
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:00,199
What will we do if he's in Nanjing?

650
00:38:00,344 --> 00:38:01,675
And what should we do if he is here?

651
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,478
In Nanjing, it doesn't matter
who the officer is...

652
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:04,740
or how much we will spend;

653
00:38:04,882 --> 00:38:05,974
We'll rescue him

654
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:08,176
Money is not the problem

655
00:38:08,886 --> 00:38:10,979
The money is easy it's the officer
that is the worry

656
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,515
I know the officer of Transportation

657
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:15,956
Maybe I can pull some strings

658
00:38:16,093 --> 00:38:18,220
No, please don't even try it

659
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:20,796
He doesn't like Ly Chen Piao
or Liu Wen Nan

660
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:22,296
They are enemies

661
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:23,559
Don't screw things up!

662
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:25,794
They couldn't help us even if
they wanted to

663
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:29,364
If he is going we will all go

664
00:38:29,507 --> 00:38:30,496
It doesn't matter what will happen

665
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:32,973
Yes... we have to
share the responsibilities

666
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:35,738
That's not the best way

667
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,239
More people doesn't mean better

668
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:42,113
Also we need to take care of our place

669
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:45,114
That's why I've been saying

670
00:38:45,256 --> 00:38:46,814
I should go
and you take care of the family

671
00:38:46,957 --> 00:38:48,481
Here we go again!

672
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,487
I mean it

673
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:55,030
I'll surrender to the law

674
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,396
All of you plead with the Government

675
00:38:57,535 --> 00:39:00,595
With your talent you'll be
better than Ly Chen Piao

676
00:39:01,572 --> 00:39:03,870
If I really wanted to work
in the Government

677
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,441
I didn't need to wait until now

678
00:39:05,876 --> 00:39:07,434
We'll find a solution

679
00:39:07,578 --> 00:39:09,375
Let's wait until
after the Double Ninth Festival

680
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:16,614
Gentlemen, we must stay together

681
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:17,982
Pao Shan is in trouble

682
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:19,521
All of us have to help him out

683
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:20,385
Yes...

684
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:22,253
You're responsible for what you did

685
00:39:22,393 --> 00:39:23,792
Pao Shan is our hero

686
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:25,293
Let's raise a toast for him

687
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:26,657
I should raise a toast to all of you

688
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:31,358
Fifth Uncle

689
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:32,264
Chen Piao

690
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:35,294
Third uncle, Second uncle, Pao Shan

691
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:36,201
Brother

692
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:37,438
Please sit down

693
00:39:44,448 --> 00:39:45,745
Mr. Sheng has said it

694
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:47,976
This time, because of Pao Shan...

695
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:49,746
He considered my situation

696
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:51,445
Helped me out a lot

697
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:54,752
I can't express my gratitude in words

698
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:57,019
I can only propose this drink
to thank you

699
00:39:57,495 --> 00:39:58,792
Pao Shan, please drink with me

700
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:02,358
I have to say something. My brother

701
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:05,634
I'll take the full responsibility

702
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:07,431
And I won't cause trouble for you

703
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:11,630
Mrs. Pei has been retired for a long time

704
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:14,745
If she did anything wrong before...

705
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:17,712
Please let her go. As a favor for my sake

706
00:40:19,383 --> 00:40:21,476
Pao Shan didn't need to ask

707
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:23,814
But as long as he said it

708
00:40:23,954 --> 00:40:25,649
I need to make myself clear

709
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:26,313
Well...

710
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:28,857
Yes, you should. Chen Piao

711
00:40:32,129 --> 00:40:34,859
Gentlemen, Mrs. Pei is a heroine

712
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:36,398
We all admire her

713
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:39,162
I'm not the best
but I still know the difference

714
00:40:40,504 --> 00:40:41,835
What kind of person do you think I am?

715
00:40:41,972 --> 00:40:43,530
Come on, cheers

716
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:45,302
Yes...

717
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:50,380
More, a little more. That's it

718
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:19,171
You're here

719
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:21,608
Sister-in-law

720
00:41:22,112 --> 00:41:23,204
Come on in

721
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:33,747
Take it slow, you play by yourself

722
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:36,189
Third brother wanted to ask you

723
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,989
I'm ready to carry out the plan

724
00:41:39,129 --> 00:41:39,857
Cousin

725
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:41,727
Third sister-in-law

726
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:42,958
Granddad Ju is here

727
00:41:44,268 --> 00:41:47,101
Xiao Chou, please take the fish tank

728
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:48,762
This little one likes it

729
00:41:48,906 --> 00:41:50,669
No...

730
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:51,906
It's nothing

731
00:41:55,546 --> 00:41:57,138
It can be a souvenir

732
00:41:57,281 --> 00:41:59,806
When I'm not here

733
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:22,466
Take care, Third Granddad

734
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:51,298
Chou Ju is an extraordinary lady

735
00:42:51,435 --> 00:42:53,767
She took care of everything

736
00:42:54,972 --> 00:42:56,496
Congratulations...

737
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,049
Thank you, please sit down

738
00:43:13,691 --> 00:43:16,159
Thank you, take a seat

739
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:21,788
Congratulations...

740
00:43:23,834 --> 00:43:25,062
Fifth Lord

741
00:43:25,836 --> 00:43:26,928
The presents are too much

742
00:43:27,071 --> 00:43:27,901
You're too kind

743
00:43:28,038 --> 00:43:29,505
It's nothing

744
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,301
Compared with the bride Jin Mei

745
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,967
We know that
you are different than others

746
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:36,409
You only have one daughter- Jin Mei

747
00:43:36,547 --> 00:43:39,675
Chong Hua will be your son-in-law

748
00:44:00,537 --> 00:44:03,529
Let's drink to it... cheers

749
00:44:05,576 --> 00:44:07,203
Bottoms up

750
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:52,720
Come on... look

751
00:45:06,904 --> 00:45:09,168
Will sister-in-law preserve her life?

752
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:17,404
Hard to say! Unless the dowager orders it

753
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:18,879
Dowager Ci Xi

754
00:45:21,018 --> 00:45:23,043
Is there anyone who can persuade her?

755
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:25,888
Who? You or me?

756
00:45:27,357 --> 00:45:30,417
Those three old men? Mr. Liu?

757
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:34,262
Quit dreaming

758
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:42,028
Mrs. Pei surrendered to the authorities

759
00:45:42,473 --> 00:45:44,202
If Mr. Liu doesn't keep his promise...

760
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:48,010
how can you face others!

761
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:06,129
Father, one is dead

762
00:46:17,374 --> 00:46:19,001
Please... go ahead

763
00:46:20,744 --> 00:46:22,439
Let's make a toast

764
00:46:30,387 --> 00:46:31,285
Where is your cousin?

765
00:46:31,421 --> 00:46:32,581
She just went back to her room

766
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:35,656
Tell her to join the party

767
00:46:41,765 --> 00:46:48,170
Cousin, Cousin...

768
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:00,881
She is not in her room

769
00:47:04,054 --> 00:47:07,080
Take some more, help yourself

770
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:21,962
- Chou Ju...
- Cousin...

771
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:27,306
She is gone

772
00:47:27,578 --> 00:47:29,102
Gone? Where did she go?

773
00:47:30,547 --> 00:47:31,571
She must have turned herself in

774
00:47:31,715 --> 00:47:33,376
Where? Where did she go?

775
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:34,912
The city

776
00:47:35,052 --> 00:47:35,381
No

777
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:36,451
The Anti-smuggling Department's office?

778
00:47:36,587 --> 00:47:37,349
No

779
00:47:37,487 --> 00:47:38,613
Then where did she go?

780
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:41,047
She must have gone to Ly Chen Piao's home

781
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:44,994
Maybe he'll take her
to Nanjing over night

782
00:47:50,067 --> 00:47:50,795
She is gone

783
00:47:50,934 --> 00:47:51,764
Who?

784
00:47:52,269 --> 00:47:53,201
Our fifth sister-in-law

785
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:55,970
I think she has gone to the authorities

786
00:47:56,106 --> 00:47:57,664
She could be stopped
at the 12th pier if we hurry

787
00:47:57,808 --> 00:47:58,638
Let's go, come on

788
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:01,641
You find the guard and ask him

789
00:48:11,788 --> 00:48:13,813
Hurry up...

790
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:49,945
Bring the criminal

791
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:51,954
What happened?

792
00:49:52,089 --> 00:49:53,021
We'd need to interrogate

793
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:53,713
Who?

794
00:49:53,857 --> 00:49:54,824
The widow Pei

795
00:49:58,428 --> 00:49:59,258
Come on out

796
00:50:03,467 --> 00:50:04,991
Hurry up...

797
00:50:06,703 --> 00:50:08,967
Come over...

798
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:18,211
Bring Pei Chou Ju

799
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:19,372
Yes

800
00:50:21,585 --> 00:50:22,950
Pei Chou Ju is here

801
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:33,955
They are calling you

802
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:37,865
Third brother

803
00:50:43,607 --> 00:50:45,438
The statement has been delivered
to Nanjing

804
00:50:45,575 --> 00:50:47,133
We've tried all we could

805
00:50:47,644 --> 00:50:49,737
The interrogator is an acquaintance

806
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,711
If you co-operate...

807
00:50:51,848 --> 00:50:52,974
It should be easy

808
00:50:56,086 --> 00:50:57,314
Pei Chou Ju

809
00:51:14,471 --> 00:51:16,200
Are you the criminal Pei Chou Ju?

810
00:51:16,339 --> 00:51:17,169
Yes

811
00:51:17,441 --> 00:51:18,965
What is your husband's name?

812
00:51:19,109 --> 00:51:20,007
Pei Din Wei

813
00:51:20,377 --> 00:51:22,368
Was he a salt smuggler before he died?

814
00:51:22,712 --> 00:51:24,236
He had no other choice

815
00:51:24,381 --> 00:51:26,144
How many people worked for him?

816
00:51:26,283 --> 00:51:29,252
From 20, 30 to 200 - 300

817
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:31,281
You've been committing organized crimes

818
00:51:31,655 --> 00:51:33,316
We were forced to break the law

819
00:51:37,861 --> 00:51:39,260
Had he ever violated the law?

820
00:51:39,396 --> 00:51:41,091
Did he resist arrest?

821
00:51:42,165 --> 00:51:44,690
It was normal to run
when you see soldiers

822
00:51:44,835 --> 00:51:46,769
Certainly you'll resist if you can

823
00:51:47,971 --> 00:51:51,429
Whose nick name is Tiger Xu?

824
00:51:51,575 --> 00:51:52,906
His name is Xu Pao Shan

825
00:51:53,043 --> 00:51:54,271
He works for me

826
00:51:55,145 --> 00:51:58,444
The word around is that
he was the real boss

827
00:51:58,582 --> 00:52:00,209
You can tell from his nick name...

828
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:02,011
the kind of personality he carries

829
00:52:02,919 --> 00:52:06,116
His temper isn't that bad

830
00:52:06,256 --> 00:52:07,746
And he is not mean at all

831
00:52:07,891 --> 00:52:10,951
It's just his look that's so intimidating

832
00:52:12,229 --> 00:52:15,892
Why do people link you
and him so closely then?

833
00:52:18,168 --> 00:52:21,399
Well... there are other reasons

834
00:52:21,538 --> 00:52:22,527
Would you be able to elaborate?

835
00:52:25,675 --> 00:52:27,506
I'm afraid it's not relevant here

836
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:31,671
I'm the one who has broken the law

837
00:52:39,422 --> 00:52:42,414
On March 8th last year

838
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:44,891
Xu Pao Shan shot an officer

839
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:47,125
What happened?

840
00:52:48,064 --> 00:52:50,294
I was also there

841
00:52:50,433 --> 00:52:53,163
I told him to fire the gun

842
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:56,271
Why did you order him to shoot?

843
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:00,503
Because I couldn't do it

844
00:53:00,777 --> 00:53:03,007
No one can shoot like Xu Pao Shan

845
00:53:03,146 --> 00:53:05,740
He shot at the officer's leg

846
00:53:08,552 --> 00:53:09,849
There is another case

847
00:53:09,986 --> 00:53:12,147
Sir, if there is any case

848
00:53:12,289 --> 00:53:14,348
It's totally my idea and all my fault

849
00:53:17,928 --> 00:53:21,955
Take her down! We'll continue it later

850
00:53:29,673 --> 00:53:32,073
It's unfair! Everything is on her

851
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:33,198
She can't be responsible for everything

852
00:53:34,644 --> 00:53:39,206
It's not right to sentence her to death

853
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:42,045
Then we should let her off easy

854
00:53:42,953 --> 00:53:47,253
It's indeed a very tough decision

855
00:53:47,624 --> 00:53:50,354
Any better suggestion?

856
00:53:51,528 --> 00:53:53,393
Can we drop the case?

857
00:53:54,698 --> 00:53:56,598
Then what should I write in the report?

858
00:53:57,467 --> 00:53:59,162
I'll try to figure out a solution...

859
00:53:59,302 --> 00:54:01,327
To keep both sides happy

860
00:54:02,305 --> 00:54:04,136
It doesn't matter what will happen

861
00:54:04,274 --> 00:54:06,902
We'd better keep Pei Chou Ju alive

862
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:11,203
The government wants salt dealers to stop

863
00:54:11,348 --> 00:54:13,009
I think the best way
is to offer Xu a deal

864
00:54:13,149 --> 00:54:15,913
He and his subordinates
can start a new life

865
00:54:16,219 --> 00:54:17,277
Nonsense!

866
00:54:17,621 --> 00:54:19,213
Are you all day-dreaming'?

867
00:54:19,356 --> 00:54:20,789
We've been in this business
for over 20 years

868
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:22,186
There're 7 - 8 hundred people
working for us

869
00:54:22,325 --> 00:54:24,919
We should just surrender
when they tell us

870
00:54:26,062 --> 00:54:28,360
They built the fort with canons

871
00:54:28,498 --> 00:54:30,864
Put Mrs. Pei in jail in Nanjing

872
00:54:31,001 --> 00:54:33,196
It's their trick!

873
00:54:33,336 --> 00:54:35,270
If they let her go

874
00:54:35,405 --> 00:54:36,463
We can divide our fortune

875
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:38,198
After that we can go on our own way

876
00:54:38,341 --> 00:54:39,330
You can surrender or run

877
00:54:39,476 --> 00:54:41,171
Otherwise we can fight them to death

878
00:54:41,511 --> 00:54:43,706
Damn it! I won't fall for his trick

879
00:54:43,847 --> 00:54:45,712
Please consider Mrs. Pei

880
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:46,747
If we make trouble...

881
00:54:46,883 --> 00:54:49,147
Maybe they'll do away with her

882
00:54:56,026 --> 00:54:58,119
All right, if that's the case

883
00:54:58,595 --> 00:55:00,529
I'm going to be honest with you

884
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:04,093
There is no future here

885
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:09,238
Sure, I won't keep you

886
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,333
But please don't do anything against us

887
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:16,036
We wish you good luck;
Where will you go?

888
00:55:18,848 --> 00:55:22,181
My friend works
in the Transportation Dept.

889
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,080
I intend requesting him for a job

890
00:55:25,522 --> 00:55:27,353
The chief Song Cuen?

891
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:37,323
All right, just remember Mrs. Pei's words

892
00:55:37,467 --> 00:55:39,560
The Chief doesn't like Liu Wen Nan

893
00:55:39,703 --> 00:55:42,194
And Ly Chen Piao either

894
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:43,806
They are two separate matters

895
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:45,635
We shouldn't mix them up

896
00:55:47,377 --> 00:55:48,639
I'm going to pack

897
00:56:10,934 --> 00:56:13,869
Don't forget where you are from!

898
00:56:14,003 --> 00:56:15,265
Mrs. Pei is in trouble

899
00:56:15,405 --> 00:56:16,963
But you're switching your side

900
00:56:17,907 --> 00:56:21,206
Bastard, I'll pay them back

901
00:56:21,478 --> 00:56:22,502
Shit! Those two?

902
00:56:22,912 --> 00:56:23,879
What's wrong?

903
00:56:24,848 --> 00:56:26,975
Don't you know the widow Pan?

904
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:28,612
She is with Xio Ko

905
00:56:29,018 --> 00:56:30,383
She lost her husband two years ago

906
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:32,454
What a bitch!

907
00:56:32,589 --> 00:56:34,181
She is trying to get attention

908
00:56:34,657 --> 00:56:37,091
Xio Ko had the affair because of her

909
00:56:37,827 --> 00:56:39,954
Are you serious?

910
00:56:40,096 --> 00:56:41,825
Why did you keep mentioning her?

911
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:44,829
Shit! You think that Pei was a nice one

912
00:56:44,968 --> 00:56:46,595
They are all the same kind

913
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:49,034
There is no difference between them

914
00:56:49,372 --> 00:56:52,000
It happened one night

915
00:57:26,075 --> 00:57:27,440
Take it easy

916
00:58:57,100 --> 00:59:00,126
Don't forget that you are a widow,
Mrs. Pan

917
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:02,494
Don't you feel ashamed?

918
00:59:08,111 --> 00:59:10,375
Listen to how honorable she sounded

919
00:59:10,513 --> 00:59:13,539
Especially with her and Tiger Xu...

920
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:14,577
He's here

921
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:15,615
Who?

922
00:59:15,752 --> 00:59:17,777
The Chief, my new boss

923
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:32,793
What are they going to do with the case?

924
00:59:33,102 --> 00:59:34,126
What are we going to do?

925
00:59:35,204 --> 00:59:36,330
That's convenient

926
00:59:36,472 --> 00:59:37,166
What a joke!

927
00:59:37,307 --> 00:59:37,966
You're right

928
00:59:38,107 --> 00:59:39,005
Are there any laws?

929
00:59:39,142 --> 00:59:40,666
No, I don't think so

930
00:59:48,618 --> 00:59:51,052
Someone filed a complaint about me

931
00:59:51,187 --> 00:59:52,779
It said that I took the order

932
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:54,116
I was in charge of arresting the dealers

933
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:57,283
Pei Chou Ju and Xu Pao Shan

934
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:59,327
But I took a bribe from them

935
00:59:59,462 --> 01:00:01,657
That I discreetly ordered their release

936
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:04,198
And also to go easy on Pei Chou Ju

937
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:06,495
I tried to help the salt dealers

938
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:09,765
There is someone here to investigate

939
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:11,471
When did it happen?

940
01:00:12,575 --> 01:00:14,167
Where did the complaint come from?

941
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:15,800
Did the chief check it up first?

942
01:00:16,512 --> 01:00:17,376
Yes

943
01:00:18,381 --> 01:00:21,316
The order is from Song Cuen

944
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:25,978
He hated me from the beginning

945
01:00:26,422 --> 01:00:27,889
How can he know all the secrets?

946
01:00:28,524 --> 01:00:29,786
It must be someone from inside

947
01:00:30,259 --> 01:00:31,317
They wanted to screw us over

948
01:00:32,161 --> 01:00:34,527
What do you think about this case?

949
01:00:34,664 --> 01:00:35,596
The sooner it's over, the better

950
01:00:36,232 --> 01:00:37,460
How about Mrs. Pei?

951
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:38,794
We don't need to worry about her

952
01:00:38,935 --> 01:00:41,529
When the verdict is out we'll move

953
01:00:44,674 --> 01:00:46,835
We have no choice

954
01:00:47,577 --> 01:00:48,601
But...

955
01:00:49,078 --> 01:00:52,844
It's for the good of Pei Chou Ju
and Xu Pao Shan

956
01:00:54,283 --> 01:00:55,614
I have to ask

957
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:59,944
If Pei Chou Ju can't stand it

958
01:01:00,089 --> 01:01:02,853
Because they keep on interrogating her

959
01:01:03,192 --> 01:01:05,353
Maybe even torture her

960
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:07,725
Say, if she can't make it...

961
01:01:07,864 --> 01:01:10,458
And confesses everything to them;

962
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,864
Xu Pao Shan won't be able to get away

963
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:14,526
When is she going to court again?

964
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:17,868
She's scheduled
to be interrogated tomorrow

965
01:01:19,075 --> 01:01:20,099
Interrogated?

966
01:01:27,817 --> 01:01:28,613
Bring the criminal

967
01:01:28,751 --> 01:01:29,718
Yes

968
01:01:30,253 --> 01:01:33,848
Come back, be nice and stop swaggering

969
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:34,854
Yes

970
01:02:02,151 --> 01:02:04,415
The criminal Pei Chou Ju is here

971
01:02:18,301 --> 01:02:19,325
Come in

972
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:53,725
Your honor

973
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:57,197
What are you doing? Get out

974
01:02:57,340 --> 01:02:58,466
Hurry up

975
01:02:59,175 --> 01:03:00,301
Lift up your head

976
01:03:06,249 --> 01:03:10,515
You don't look like a killer

977
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:13,983
I've never killed anyone

978
01:03:15,358 --> 01:03:17,155
How many subordinates do you have?

979
01:03:18,161 --> 01:03:19,822
I didn't count

980
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:23,189
I've never thought of them
as my subordinates

981
01:03:23,332 --> 01:03:25,630
We're just working for a living

982
01:03:25,768 --> 01:03:28,396
Helping each other when need be

983
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:33,169
Do you know it's illegal dealing salt?

984
01:03:35,278 --> 01:03:39,078
Please forgive me, your honor

985
01:03:39,215 --> 01:03:41,740
I know it's illegal

986
01:03:42,552 --> 01:03:46,488
I have a big family to support

987
01:03:46,622 --> 01:03:48,419
There was no choice for me

988
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:52,855
Please listen to her

989
01:03:53,229 --> 01:03:55,823
We are the officers of the Government

990
01:03:55,965 --> 01:03:59,230
We should take care of their livelihood

991
01:03:59,368 --> 01:04:00,699
You're absolutely right

992
01:04:02,605 --> 01:04:04,869
Who is Xu Pao Shan?

993
01:04:05,708 --> 01:04:07,505
He works for me

994
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:10,645
He does what I tell him to

995
01:04:11,314 --> 01:04:13,612
If he has done anything
it is because of me

996
01:04:13,749 --> 01:04:15,410
I told him to; so it's my fault

997
01:04:15,551 --> 01:04:17,712
What kind of a person is he?

998
01:04:20,456 --> 01:04:24,187
He is very kind and capable

999
01:04:24,794 --> 01:04:26,625
Not a mean person at all

1000
01:04:27,830 --> 01:04:31,357
Just for jobs sake, he listens to me

1001
01:04:31,734 --> 01:04:34,760
He is innocent

1002
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:39,732
Do you think that he can change?

1003
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:41,901
I mean, if I allow him a chance

1004
01:04:43,145 --> 01:04:45,545
If your honor is so understanding

1005
01:04:45,681 --> 01:04:47,376
Not only will Xu Pao Shan appreciate it

1006
01:04:47,516 --> 01:04:51,282
I would also be grateful to you

1007
01:05:03,266 --> 01:05:06,963
Pei Chou Ju, the Government is generous

1008
01:05:07,103 --> 01:05:10,072
I would like to release you too

1009
01:05:13,676 --> 01:05:15,405
But you've been charged with
serious crimes

1010
01:05:15,544 --> 01:05:17,535
I HAVE TO sentence you to death

1011
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:26,218
Is there anything that
you would like to say?

1012
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:33,085
Yes, your honor

1013
01:05:33,229 --> 01:05:36,426
I'm responsible for all the crimes

1014
01:05:36,565 --> 01:05:38,157
I don't want to hurt the innocent

1015
01:05:39,035 --> 01:05:44,564
And please grant me a last favor

1016
01:05:44,707 --> 01:05:46,402
I'd rather avoid being embarrassed

1017
01:05:49,312 --> 01:05:51,542
She wants to have death by hanging

1018
01:05:51,681 --> 01:05:53,148
Don't chop her head off in the public

1019
01:05:56,752 --> 01:06:00,381
I won't let you be embarrassed

1020
01:06:01,824 --> 01:06:03,121
Take her back

1021
01:06:03,259 --> 01:06:04,248
Yes

1022
01:06:08,197 --> 01:06:09,687
Thank you, your honor

1023
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:22,903
It's a set up, he set us up

1024
01:06:23,045 --> 01:06:24,512
Son of a bitch! Ly Chen Piao

1025
01:06:25,348 --> 01:06:40,787
Let me go... leave me alone

1026
01:06:41,697 --> 01:06:44,188
Pao Shan, Pao Shan

1027
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:48,736
Fifth Uncle, please do something

1028
01:06:48,871 --> 01:06:51,135
All right, please get up

1029
01:06:54,377 --> 01:06:55,867
I have to get even with Ly Chen Piao

1030
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:58,537
You don't have to tell us, Pao Shan

1031
01:06:58,681 --> 01:07:01,411
We understand your feelings

1032
01:07:02,618 --> 01:07:04,677
But I have to be fair

1033
01:07:05,654 --> 01:07:08,384
Chong Hua and myself saw it in Nanjing

1034
01:07:09,792 --> 01:07:12,659
Chen Piao was trying his best to help

1035
01:07:12,995 --> 01:07:16,590
But she still got the death penalty

1036
01:07:16,732 --> 01:07:19,223
I can't let them do it

1037
01:07:20,169 --> 01:07:20,897
I'm going...

1038
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:22,061
What are you going to do?

1039
01:07:22,204 --> 01:07:23,171
We are going to Nanjing

1040
01:07:23,305 --> 01:07:24,101
To do what?

1041
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:25,366
To have Pei Chou Ju freed

1042
01:07:25,741 --> 01:07:26,765
Nonsense

1043
01:07:27,143 --> 01:07:28,701
I'm telling you, don't be stupid

1044
01:07:28,844 --> 01:07:30,539
Don't do anything stupid

1045
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:33,811
Should I just let her die?

1046
01:07:33,949 --> 01:07:34,847
How can I forgive myself?

1047
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:37,978
Pao Shan, be serious

1048
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:40,315
If you fail, you will also die

1049
01:07:40,456 --> 01:07:42,947
Even if you're successful
where will you go?

1050
01:07:43,092 --> 01:07:45,083
Just for fifth madam

1051
01:07:45,227 --> 01:07:46,785
You will kill many of our brothers

1052
01:07:46,929 --> 01:07:48,419
I don't think Mrs. Pei
would agree with it

1053
01:07:49,031 --> 01:07:51,693
Brother, my cousin gave you a message

1054
01:07:51,834 --> 01:07:53,597
She said the same thing hundred times

1055
01:07:53,736 --> 01:07:54,930
She wants you to stop breaking the law

1056
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:56,402
Lead a normal life

1057
01:07:56,539 --> 01:07:57,528
She is not only doing it for you

1058
01:07:57,673 --> 01:07:58,935
But also for everybody

1059
01:07:59,075 --> 01:07:59,769
If you go against her wishes...

1060
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:01,501
You'll ruin the whole plan

1061
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:07,039
Who broke the original agreement?

1062
01:08:07,183 --> 01:08:08,650
We've arranged it already

1063
01:08:08,784 --> 01:08:09,842
Someone complained about us

1064
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:11,416
Who did this shit?

1065
01:08:11,554 --> 01:08:13,283
I heard it was
the chief of transportation

1066
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:17,723
It's so strange; he knew everything!

1067
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:19,584
Someone must have leaked the news

1068
01:08:19,728 --> 01:08:20,490
Who do you think?

1069
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:22,090
The Chief of Transportation

1070
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:29,633
It's him

1071
01:08:31,307 --> 01:08:32,365
For sure

1072
01:08:33,375 --> 01:08:36,173
Brother...

1073
01:08:38,414 --> 01:08:39,711
It's him. Brother

1074
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:43,051
Son of a bitch! It's really him. Let's go

1075
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:47,111
What happened? Pao Shan

1076
01:08:47,256 --> 01:08:48,689
I'm going to get the person who betrayed

1077
01:08:48,824 --> 01:08:49,620
Who?

1078
01:08:49,758 --> 01:08:50,816
You'll know very soon

1079
01:08:59,368 --> 01:09:00,494
Jin Mei

1080
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:03,627
Fifth Sister

1081
01:09:07,843 --> 01:09:09,037
What are you doing here?

1082
01:09:09,545 --> 01:09:10,944
How could I not come to see you!

1083
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:14,074
We really miss you

1084
01:09:14,683 --> 01:09:16,446
No, come on

1085
01:09:18,988 --> 01:09:19,852
Please sit down

1086
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:23,651
Before it's time for me to leave,

1087
01:09:23,792 --> 01:09:25,760
let me take a good look at you all

1088
01:09:26,495 --> 01:09:27,757
Have you chosen the date?

1089
01:09:27,897 --> 01:09:28,864
Not yet

1090
01:09:29,398 --> 01:09:30,729
Why not?

1091
01:09:32,468 --> 01:09:34,299
You're young; you can take it slow

1092
01:09:35,371 --> 01:09:37,066
But how about your father

1093
01:09:37,573 --> 01:09:39,541
He wants to have grandsons

1094
01:09:40,042 --> 01:09:41,942
The earliest will be over the New Year

1095
01:09:42,811 --> 01:09:44,005
Why not before the New Year?

1096
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:48,043
There are too many things happening

1097
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:53,519
We're so looking forward to your return

1098
01:10:03,065 --> 01:10:04,999
I sewed a pair of pillow cases for you

1099
01:10:05,701 --> 01:10:08,431
I don't think I can attend your wedding

1100
01:10:09,838 --> 01:10:11,897
Please accept my gift

1101
01:10:12,741 --> 01:10:15,175
When you see it, it'll be like seeing me

1102
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:31,925
Jin Mei, cousin

1103
01:10:33,495 --> 01:10:34,985
You are here!

1104
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:37,931
There is nothing I should say

1105
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:41,897
I hope you will have a wonderful future

1106
01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:46,572
Help and be considerate to each other

1107
01:10:48,277 --> 01:10:49,835
I'm your match-maker

1108
01:10:50,779 --> 01:10:53,247
I'd be so happy...

1109
01:10:53,682 --> 01:10:55,479
If you have a great life

1110
01:10:56,719 --> 01:10:59,916
Cousin, I'll remember your words

1111
01:11:01,423 --> 01:11:03,118
Always

1112
01:11:07,896 --> 01:11:11,855
Chong Hua, the message I gave you

1113
01:11:12,001 --> 01:11:12,865
Did you tell Xu Pao Shan?

1114
01:11:13,936 --> 01:11:14,925
Yes, I did

1115
01:11:15,237 --> 01:11:16,534
What is he doing now?

1116
01:11:17,773 --> 01:11:19,240
He went out to take care of some business

1117
01:11:20,843 --> 01:11:21,775
What kind of business?

1118
01:11:22,378 --> 01:11:24,778
He has gone to find out who framed you up

1119
01:11:25,147 --> 01:11:25,943
Who did it?

1120
01:11:26,081 --> 01:11:26,877
Who?

1121
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:50,903
Bring Dong Jin Piao in

1122
01:12:18,067 --> 01:12:19,534
Dong Jin Piao

1123
01:12:19,668 --> 01:12:22,796
You broke your vow

1124
01:12:23,272 --> 01:12:27,038
Do you know the rules?

1125
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:28,165
Are you guilty?

1126
01:12:30,179 --> 01:12:32,773
I don't know. What do you mean?

1127
01:12:33,048 --> 01:12:33,980
You're lying

1128
01:12:34,616 --> 01:12:36,516
Why did you leak the news?

1129
01:12:36,652 --> 01:12:38,244
You gave Chief information

1130
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:41,656
I didn't. Who told you so?

1131
01:12:41,790 --> 01:12:42,654
I did

1132
01:12:45,994 --> 01:12:47,859
You... you don't have any proof

1133
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:50,355
We've got the proof, you can't lie to us

1134
01:12:51,433 --> 01:12:53,367
Please bring out Ce Jin Piao

1135
01:13:00,075 --> 01:13:01,372
So you were undercover

1136
01:13:03,278 --> 01:13:07,442
All right, I made a wrong friend

1137
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:11,147
Not you, it was Mr. Pei

1138
01:13:11,286 --> 01:13:12,844
He shouldn't have kept you as a friend

1139
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:15,747
Yes, Pei Din Wei went blind...

1140
01:13:15,891 --> 01:13:17,552
to have you as his friend

1141
01:13:17,860 --> 01:13:19,987
Marrying an old hag Pei Chou Ju

1142
01:13:20,729 --> 01:13:22,094
Dong Jin Piao

1143
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:24,529
Would you again
violate predecessors crime;

1144
01:13:24,666 --> 01:13:26,190
Disrespect those before us?

1145
01:13:31,874 --> 01:13:35,310
All right, I confess

1146
01:13:36,945 --> 01:13:37,969
I'll accept the punishment

1147
01:13:39,481 --> 01:13:41,244
Do you submit willingly?

1148
01:13:41,383 --> 01:13:43,613
Yes, I do

1149
01:13:43,752 --> 01:13:45,276
As long as you agree

1150
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:46,547
I have to use our domestic regulations

1151
01:13:46,688 --> 01:13:47,347
Bring it

1152
01:13:47,489 --> 01:13:48,513
Yes

1153
01:13:56,799 --> 01:13:59,165
There are rules that we need to follow

1154
01:13:59,468 --> 01:14:01,766
You'll get the punishment

1155
01:14:01,904 --> 01:14:04,168
If you broke a rule

1156
01:14:04,306 --> 01:14:06,069
Everyone is treated equally

1157
01:14:07,342 --> 01:14:09,333
Dong Jin Piao is no longer one of us

1158
01:14:09,545 --> 01:14:11,206
Brand his arm

1159
01:14:11,346 --> 01:14:12,335
Yes

1160
01:15:39,568 --> 01:15:40,091
There are gun shots

1161
01:15:40,235 --> 01:15:41,167
Gun shots?

1162
01:15:44,172 --> 01:15:48,233
Nothing! It's all right...

1163
01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:25,537
Stop! Don't run

1164
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:27,347
What are you doing?

1165
01:16:27,482 --> 01:16:29,473
Stop running! I'll shoot

1166
01:16:30,485 --> 01:16:32,282
Don't run

1167
01:16:39,761 --> 01:16:44,130
Don't fight anymore...

1168
01:16:44,266 --> 01:16:45,358
I'm telling you

1169
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:47,764
It's our own family matter.
Stay out of it

1170
01:16:48,637 --> 01:16:49,535
Stop running

1171
01:17:13,662 --> 01:17:14,458
Wait a moment

1172
01:17:14,730 --> 01:17:16,527
Shit! So many on one

1173
01:17:16,665 --> 01:17:18,155
What kind of people are you?!

1174
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:20,268
You shot without warning

1175
01:17:20,402 --> 01:17:21,630
What rules are you talking about

1176
01:17:22,037 --> 01:17:24,631
What? I can't handle you

1177
01:17:25,474 --> 01:17:27,772
There are regulations everywhere

1178
01:17:27,909 --> 01:17:29,672
You shouldn't hit after the punishment

1179
01:17:29,811 --> 01:17:31,802
Do you dare to go
against the domestic rules?

1180
01:17:32,114 --> 01:17:33,479
Brother, we don't need to talk to him

1181
01:17:33,615 --> 01:17:34,104
Come on

1182
01:17:34,249 --> 01:17:35,273
Wait

1183
01:17:35,651 --> 01:17:36,913
None of you is allowed to take him

1184
01:19:44,846 --> 01:19:46,871
Commander Ly gave this to you

1185
01:19:51,453 --> 01:19:55,890
It's your time. You should try it

1186
01:19:56,825 --> 01:20:00,625
You'll be fine after you eat it

1187
01:20:03,198 --> 01:20:04,563
Thank you

1188
01:20:06,234 --> 01:20:08,099
Thank you, Auntie Wong

1189
01:20:14,342 --> 01:20:15,934
Thank you, Commander Ly

1190
01:20:17,045 --> 01:20:19,036
Thank you, Secretary Chen

1191
01:20:20,115 --> 01:20:22,140
I'm satisfied with my life

1192
01:20:22,818 --> 01:20:24,513
I'm ready to die

1193
01:20:26,354 --> 01:20:30,051
Everyone is so nice to me

1194
01:20:31,793 --> 01:20:34,694
I can't repay it even with my life

1195
01:20:39,334 --> 01:20:45,569
Sister-in-law Pei, you are the hero

1196
01:20:46,675 --> 01:20:48,575
I've never seen it before

1197
01:20:54,249 --> 01:20:57,446
All the stuff, see if anyone can use it

1198
01:20:57,586 --> 01:20:59,019
Please give them away

1199
01:21:00,255 --> 01:21:01,620
We've been friends for a long time

1200
01:21:01,756 --> 01:21:03,223
I ought to give you something for memory

1201
01:21:03,358 --> 01:21:06,225
I don't want it. You should keep it

1202
01:21:06,494 --> 01:21:07,961
I'll split these among the others

1203
01:21:49,104 --> 01:21:50,230
Chou Ju

1204
01:21:54,142 --> 01:21:54,767
She's dead

1205
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:55,274
Who is dead?

1206
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:56,502
Pei Chou Ju

1207
01:21:56,645 --> 01:21:57,111
How could she have died!

1208
01:21:57,245 --> 01:21:58,269
It's really scary

1209
01:21:58,747 --> 01:22:01,147
Follow me... let's go...

1210
01:22:07,422 --> 01:22:08,753
Carry her out

1211
01:22:37,152 --> 01:22:38,642
Cover it up, cover it up

1212
01:22:43,391 --> 01:22:44,323
Nails

1213
01:22:45,493 --> 01:22:49,020
There is always a way to bribe an officer

1214
01:22:49,164 --> 01:22:51,029
After pulling some strings...

1215
01:22:51,166 --> 01:22:53,031
We used a switch

1216
01:22:53,168 --> 01:22:54,635
Mrs. Pei was rescued by us

1217
01:22:55,603 --> 01:22:58,333
Dong Jin Piao deserved it

1218
01:22:59,174 --> 01:23:02,143
We simply couldn't have allowed her
to sacrifice

1219
01:23:03,545 --> 01:23:05,410
We sold lots of illegal salt

1220
01:23:05,547 --> 01:23:08,641
With our wealth
we can make the difference

1221
01:23:09,551 --> 01:23:12,486
But we are carrying a dead person

1222
01:23:12,620 --> 01:23:14,611
It's pretty spooky!

1223
01:23:14,889 --> 01:23:17,881
Stop...

1224
01:23:18,393 --> 01:23:19,121
Don't move

1225
01:23:22,897 --> 01:23:25,661
We're from Anti-smuggling.
What're you up to?

1226
01:23:26,968 --> 01:23:28,367
This is Mrs. Pei's coffin

1227
01:23:28,703 --> 01:23:30,295
I don't care whose coffin it is

1228
01:23:30,438 --> 01:23:32,531
Open it. C'mon, be quick

1229
01:23:44,386 --> 01:23:45,910
They need to check it

1230
01:23:55,830 --> 01:23:57,229
Try offering them some money

1231
01:23:57,365 --> 01:23:58,457
Okay

1232
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:06,839
Mrs. Pei was a private person

1233
01:24:06,975 --> 01:24:08,442
Please help her for the last time

1234
01:24:08,843 --> 01:24:12,609
All right! Let's leave

1235
01:24:20,555 --> 01:24:22,182
What a pity!

1236
01:24:22,724 --> 01:24:24,658
I was a civilian and became an officer

1237
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:27,526
Because I'm an officer I have to be fair

1238
01:24:28,530 --> 01:24:31,124
We once swore we wouldn't let anyone go

1239
01:24:31,266 --> 01:24:33,564
Even the commander in chief

1240
01:24:34,536 --> 01:24:37,403
Now he is the president

1241
01:24:38,073 --> 01:24:39,836
But he aspires to be the Emperor

1242
01:24:40,909 --> 01:24:43,377
If he becomes the Emperor

1243
01:24:44,579 --> 01:24:48,106
Damn it! One day I'll...

1244
01:24:48,483 --> 01:24:49,279
Sir

1245
01:24:55,190 --> 01:24:58,455
The President sent me to bring you

1246
01:24:58,593 --> 01:25:00,356
He wants the commander
to go to the capital

1247
01:25:02,397 --> 01:25:03,728
You tell the President

1248
01:25:03,865 --> 01:25:05,457
When my millions of soldiers are ready...

1249
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:07,534
I'll go to see him

1250
01:25:07,669 --> 01:25:09,159
Yes...

1251
01:25:09,537 --> 01:25:14,133
The President knows that
you admire antiques

1252
01:25:14,275 --> 01:25:17,472
He told me to bring a vase as a gift

1253
01:25:17,612 --> 01:25:18,738
Please accept it

1254
01:25:26,187 --> 01:25:27,779
What are you looking at? Get lost

1255
01:25:27,922 --> 01:25:29,753
Yes sir...
