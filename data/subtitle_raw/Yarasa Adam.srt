1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000


3
00:04:11,202 --> 00:04:13,187
Keep your eyes open.
Let's go.

4
00:04:41,561 --> 00:04:43,312
-Alo
-Alo, is this the police department?

5
00:04:43,451 --> 00:04:45,181
I am Cengiz Arslan, officer.

6
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,565
My life is in danger.

7
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:47,045
Yes.

8
00:04:48,027 --> 00:04:49,607
No, they want to kill me.

9
00:04:49,629 --> 00:04:50,782
Several people I don't know.

10
00:04:51,572 --> 00:04:54,828
They were threatening on the phone, the last
few days. I don't know anything about it.

11
00:04:54,849 --> 00:04:55,778
-Please continue.

12
00:05:44,749 --> 00:05:51,451
-3 of the people who has been selected by
your magazine as one of the 10 most
fashionable people, are murdered.

13
00:05:51,676 --> 00:05:53,800
Besides, perpetrators are still unknown.

14
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,227
Doesn't it sound a little strange to you?

15
00:05:57,889 --> 00:06:00,067
-I couldn't understand what you're implying.

16
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:03,306
You mean I am accused of murder?

17
00:06:03,338 --> 00:06:04,213
-No, no...

18
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:07,544
-We can't have an opinion about anyone for now.

19
00:06:08,263 --> 00:06:16,249
As you know, our company has insured this
ten people including you for large sums of money.

20
00:06:16,453 --> 00:06:18,396
This is quite a hard situation.

21
00:06:19,111 --> 00:06:22,677
And you know that the insurances
were made by your magazine.

22
00:06:22,752 --> 00:06:26,638
We are paying one million liras for
each person who dies.

23
00:06:26,713 --> 00:06:30,716
Up until now, we payed 3 million
liras for the 3 people who died.

24
00:06:32,555 --> 00:06:34,370
-So, why do I care?

25
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,206
-Of course, for now there is nothing
you should worry about.

26
00:06:39,793 --> 00:06:41,928
Only, I want to state this:

27
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,651
If these murders don't stop, the
police may arrest you.

28
00:06:45,366 --> 00:06:46,188
-Is it over?

29
00:06:46,637 --> 00:06:48,121
-Yes... For now...

30
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:49,753
-If you excuse me...

31
00:08:28,277 --> 00:08:29,248
-Hello, Betmen.

32
00:08:30,626 --> 00:08:33,882
Firstly, we congratulate you for
the success on your last heroin mission.

33
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,851
Let's talk about your new mission now.

34
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:39,278
You have probably read about the murders
commited in the last few days on the newspapers.

35
00:08:39,545 --> 00:08:43,228
You will see their pictures when
you look in the folder next to the stereo.

36
00:08:45,534 --> 00:08:49,057
As we predict the rest will be murdered as well.

37
00:08:49,858 --> 00:08:55,164
If you want the ringleader's name, we can
only give you Altan Soner, the magazine owner.

38
00:08:56,414 --> 00:08:59,318
Despite there is no proof, he is the only suspect.

39
00:08:59,852 --> 00:09:02,980
That means, he is the only person
to benefit from these murders.

40
00:09:04,207 --> 00:09:08,083
Victims and the others have been insured
for one million liras by his magazine.

41
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:11,201
He is in a conclusin that he will
loot a great deal of money this way.

42
00:09:12,055 --> 00:09:14,628
Because, he has chosen the jury
that conducted the contest...

43
00:09:14,703 --> 00:09:16,796
...some illegal actions appeared.

44
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,603
and his men silenced the ones that have objected

45
00:09:20,723 --> 00:09:22,666
He is not a reliable person.

46
00:09:23,147 --> 00:09:26,339
The interesting part of it is that
he insured himself as well.

47
00:09:27,076 --> 00:09:29,446
It's clear that there is
something wrong about this.

48
00:09:30,492 --> 00:09:33,449
He may try to kill everyone who opposes him.

49
00:09:34,415 --> 00:09:37,757
He is too interested in a beautiful
girl called Emel among them.

50
00:09:38,098 --> 00:09:39,988
We suggest that he feels close to her.

51
00:09:41,066 --> 00:09:43,383
We have no certain proof against him

52
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:46,031
His men are faithful to him to the death.

53
00:09:46,797 --> 00:09:49,199
We learned that he runs a night club in Beirut.

54
00:09:49,733 --> 00:09:52,616
It's certain that he will flee abroad if he succeed.

55
00:09:53,054 --> 00:09:58,178
In that case, we will lose a criminal and a lot of currency.

56
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:01,093
I guess you understand the importance of this mission.

57
00:10:01,781 --> 00:10:05,635
If you succeed this mission and
catch him with all the proof,

58
00:10:05,753 --> 00:10:09,404
the insurance company has promised a prize for you.

59
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:11,838
Our confidence for you is limitless.

60
00:10:12,257 --> 00:10:14,691
You may ask our help if you need it.

61
00:10:15,822 --> 00:10:17,659
We wish you good luck.

62
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:20,093
As usual, destroy the tape after it ends.

63
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,520
-Bravo, Robin.

64
00:11:13,235 --> 00:11:14,580
You're still in good shape.

65
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,730
Listen what I'm about to say very carefully.

66
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,724
-I'm listening.

67
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:22,225
-You may have read about the
three murders on the newspapers.

68
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:22,973
-Yes.

69
00:11:23,848 --> 00:11:27,275
-3 of the 9 people insured by our company.

70
00:11:28,001 --> 00:11:29,069
-Is this a conspiracy

71
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:30,531
-I think it is certain.

72
00:11:30,778 --> 00:11:32,198
The others will be killed too.

73
00:11:32,753 --> 00:11:35,807
So, someone who insured them will have the money.

74
00:11:36,565 --> 00:11:38,145
-Who insures them?

75
00:11:38,294 --> 00:11:39,682
-A magazine owner.

76
00:11:39,746 --> 00:11:41,636
His name is Altan.
Altan Soner...

77
00:11:42,632 --> 00:11:44,373
Nothing can be done because the lack of evidence.

78
00:11:45,034 --> 00:11:48,643
Before the others get killed, we must
intervene and clear the case.

79
00:11:49,924 --> 00:11:52,091
We will start with Seher, the stripper.

80
00:11:52,273 --> 00:11:52,967
-Okay!

81
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:53,606
-Someone's coming!

82
00:15:00,244 --> 00:15:01,774
-She's dead.

83
00:15:11,725 --> 00:15:13,897
Speak!

84
00:15:31,487 --> 00:15:32,956
-I was expecting you.

85
00:15:33,873 --> 00:15:36,137
What will you discuss with me?

86
00:15:38,156 --> 00:15:42,592
-The people who are selected by your magazine and gets murdered one by one.

87
00:15:42,806 --> 00:15:46,140
-How dare you? What does
it have to do with me?

88
00:15:46,538 --> 00:15:48,435
-Don't get angry all of a sudden.

89
00:15:48,692 --> 00:15:51,169
We were only going to ask a couple of questions.

90
00:15:51,231 --> 00:15:52,883
-Like what?

91
00:15:53,066 --> 00:15:58,909
-Can you give me the jury list of the
competition that your magazine conducted?

92
00:15:59,062 --> 00:16:04,140
-Unfortunately, I don't
remember the juries now.

93
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:08,975
-Maybe you remember
but you don't want to give it.

94
00:16:09,188 --> 00:16:12,492
-Look, you can't accuse me like this.

95
00:16:12,645 --> 00:16:16,713
My magazine conducted a
competition and 10 people won it.

96
00:16:16,805 --> 00:16:19,558
What is it to me if they keep dying?

97
00:16:19,681 --> 00:16:23,015
In the other hand, I am
one of those 10 people.

98
00:16:23,535 --> 00:16:26,013
-And that's what I don't understand.

99
00:16:26,135 --> 00:16:27,971
-Please stop this conversation here.

100
00:16:28,743 --> 00:16:30,395
-Have a nice day.

101
00:16:32,781 --> 00:16:34,341
-Have a nice day, sir.

102
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:49,300
-What do they want?

103
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,289
-Nothing.

104
00:16:51,931 --> 00:16:54,134
They're coming from the insurance company.

105
00:16:54,776 --> 00:16:57,101
-I've seen you a little angry.

106
00:16:57,254 --> 00:16:59,212
Has something distasteful happened?

107
00:16:59,701 --> 00:17:01,139
-No, sweetheart.

108
00:17:01,292 --> 00:17:04,747
What can be distasteful when you're around.

109
00:17:05,177 --> 00:17:06,860
My tasteful...

110
00:17:19,763 --> 00:17:21,293
-So, what do we do now?

111
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:24,352
-Let's go to Emel first. Let's
see what she's doing.

112
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:28,329
We should also learn if she has insurance.

113
00:17:28,726 --> 00:17:30,072
-What about Altan?

114
00:17:30,348 --> 00:17:31,908
-Don't think about him for now.

115
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,804
But we won't forget about him either.

116
00:17:34,202 --> 00:17:36,558
We will find out what he's up to.

117
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:37,506
C'mon

118
00:21:08,468 --> 00:21:10,120
-Thank you.

119
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:12,323
I won't forget about your favor.

120
00:21:12,445 --> 00:21:14,648
Don't exaggerate what we do.

121
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:16,820
But take care of yourself.

122
00:21:16,973 --> 00:21:19,420
Be careful when you go out.

123
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,959
And don't forget to lock the door when you're inside.

124
00:21:22,082 --> 00:21:22,724
-I won't

125
00:21:23,856 --> 00:21:25,661
-By the way, do you have insurance?

126
00:21:25,753 --> 00:21:28,414
-No, I have no intention either.

127
00:21:28,689 --> 00:21:29,944
-Spot on!

128
00:21:30,035 --> 00:21:32,758
If you had any, you could have been in trouble.

129
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:33,339
-Like what?

130
00:21:33,431 --> 00:21:36,918
-Anyway, forget about this now. We
will keep an eye on you.

131
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:39,794
You will help us solve all our problems.

132
00:21:39,886 --> 00:21:42,303
-Have a nice day.
-Have a nice day.

133
00:21:56,593 --> 00:22:00,181
-We can't accuse anyone without a proof.

134
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:05,781
-But you have to do something. You
have to broaden the investigation.

135
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:08,397
Our men are after the suspects as well.

136
00:22:08,564 --> 00:22:11,448
-Investigation continues day and night.

137
00:22:11,649 --> 00:22:14,499
Of course we have some information.

138
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,255
But the result is not satisfactory yet.

139
00:22:18,517 --> 00:22:24,352
-To pay all that money would shake our company. 
The others are insured as well. They might get killed too.

140
00:22:24,452 --> 00:22:27,973
-You don't worry. We will do as much as we can.

141
00:22:28,074 --> 00:22:30,186
Justice always comes at the end.

142
00:22:30,253 --> 00:22:32,567
-Alright. Thank you.

143
00:26:30,234 --> 00:26:33,353
-You had womething to do outside,
right? Let's go have a walk.

144
00:26:42,272 --> 00:26:43,580
-You, fools.

145
00:26:43,647 --> 00:26:46,900
How come you let her slip away, idiots?

146
00:26:47,403 --> 00:26:50,487
-All of a sudden, two men like bats have shown up.

147
00:26:50,622 --> 00:26:53,204
We couldn't understand how it happened.

148
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:54,202
-Cut it out!

149
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:56,851
Always have an excuse!

150
00:26:56,985 --> 00:27:00,539
Is that why I'm giving you fistfuls of money, you fucking idiots?

151
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,679
-Listen to me.

152
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,356
We won't change the row.

153
00:27:03,457 --> 00:27:05,670
You'll finish Funda today.

154
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:16,434
As I understand, we're dealing  with Betmen.

155
00:27:16,534 --> 00:27:19,250
That's why we need to be very careful.

156
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,765
-What is it, honey? Are you scared?

157
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:24,619
-You know I'm not.

158
00:27:24,753 --> 00:27:27,436
But still, we need to be careful.

159
00:27:30,588 --> 00:27:34,042
-Leave him to me if you want. I can finish him.

160
00:27:34,176 --> 00:27:37,294
-No, we will defeat him without killing him.

161
00:27:39,776 --> 00:27:43,632
I will play such a game to him,
even he won't understand it.

162
00:27:43,732 --> 00:27:44,805
-You know the best.

163
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,823
-Come, come, darling.

164
00:27:55,938 --> 00:27:58,017
-Did Altan make an offer to you?

165
00:27:58,116 --> 00:28:02,308
-He said that he is a prosperous man. Bu
he said it doesn't satisfy him.

166
00:28:02,643 --> 00:28:04,957
-Did he want to get you insurance?
-Yes.

167
00:28:05,024 --> 00:28:06,566
But of of course I didn't accept it.

168
00:28:06,633 --> 00:28:08,109
He is a dangerous man.

169
00:28:08,444 --> 00:28:09,919
-Nevermind. It doesn't matter.

170
00:28:10,456 --> 00:28:13,440
-How did you become Betmen? to
be more exact, why did you?

171
00:28:13,474 --> 00:28:17,162
-There is a power inside me against evil
that I don't know the foundation of.

172
00:28:17,464 --> 00:28:19,711
And my bat costume gives terror to evil people.

173
00:28:19,945 --> 00:28:22,158
-So, you're powerless against the good?

174
00:28:22,293 --> 00:28:23,466
-Yes.

175
00:28:24,237 --> 00:28:27,960
And especially against a pretty girl like you.

176
00:28:28,094 --> 00:28:31,447
For the good people, my fists are like turkish
delights, and my kicks are candies.

177
00:28:31,514 --> 00:28:32,654
-You're so humorous!

178
00:28:32,755 --> 00:28:35,135
I feel more comfortable with you.

179
00:28:35,337 --> 00:28:36,946
I feel prideful

180
00:29:18,463 --> 00:29:20,810
-Thank you for everything.

181
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:24,422
-Don't worry about anything. be calm.

182
00:29:24,925 --> 00:29:26,266
I'll call you.

183
00:29:28,144 --> 00:29:29,787
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

184
00:30:19,796 --> 00:30:21,775
-Yes?
-May I come?

185
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:26,805
-One moment.

186
00:30:41,537 --> 00:30:43,515
Yes, I'm listening.

187
00:30:44,924 --> 00:30:46,801
-Your name was Funda, right?

188
00:30:46,936 --> 00:30:47,874
-Yes.

189
00:30:49,585 --> 00:30:51,965
-I will discuss some metters with you.

190
00:32:31,379 --> 00:32:32,485
-Alo?

191
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:35,000
-Alo, I'm Emel.
-Holy shit.

192
00:32:35,168 --> 00:32:36,643
Yes, darling.

193
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:39,275
-Sorry, darling. Can I see you?

194
00:32:39,409 --> 00:32:43,030
-Oh, yes, of course. I would be delighted.

195
00:32:44,271 --> 00:32:46,920
But I've got a terrible fever. See you tomorrow, right?

196
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,093
-Betmen!

197
00:33:42,736 --> 00:33:43,977
Betmen!

198
00:33:45,151 --> 00:33:46,257
-Shit.

199
00:33:47,431 --> 00:33:49,107
Now, I'm fucked.

200
00:33:59,004 --> 00:34:00,446
-Wear it quickly.

201
00:34:18,553 --> 00:34:21,739
-Now, I'm sick and you're the nurse, okay?

202
00:34:22,007 --> 00:34:25,629
-We will fool them with this trick. But
don't ever let them understand.

203
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:27,439
Now, run and open the door.

204
00:34:39,922 --> 00:34:42,269
-Come in. I'm the nurse.

205
00:34:48,271 --> 00:34:51,994
-Oh, my darling. What happened
to you? How did you get cold?

206
00:34:52,128 --> 00:34:55,917
Oh god. What to do? I
should better get a towel.

207
00:34:58,499 --> 00:35:00,041
-50

208
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:03,461
You're medically not alive, son.

209
00:35:05,332 --> 00:35:08,048
-It's 50 degrees.

210
00:35:10,798 --> 00:35:12,608
-Just be busy with your patient.

211
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:18,108
I'm so sick, okay? If you care about
your life, you'll tell her that I'm sick.

212
00:35:18,443 --> 00:35:21,025
-Understood?
-Okay, Okay...

213
00:35:25,183 --> 00:35:28,134
-What a pity, darling. How did you get this fever?

214
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:33,063
-Do I know what the hell I'm doing?

215
00:35:35,377 --> 00:35:39,669
-He's got a terrible fever. I must give
you a prescription. Take them immediately.

216
00:36:09,508 --> 00:36:12,257
-You have to take these medicine immediately.

217
00:36:13,934 --> 00:36:16,114
-I am going to the drug store. I'll be right back.

218
00:36:16,214 --> 00:36:19,634
-Don't rush. Take your time.

219
00:36:24,276 --> 00:36:26,455
Finally, they're gone.

220
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:28,635
It's over now.

221
00:36:35,375 --> 00:36:36,783
-It's me, Robin.

222
00:36:37,286 --> 00:36:39,868
I've gone to Funda's house but she's killed.

223
00:36:40,438 --> 00:36:41,578
-What did you say?

224
00:36:42,249 --> 00:36:44,127
I'm going to Funda's house.

225
00:37:08,629 --> 00:37:10,407
-What a pity. We're late.

226
00:37:11,077 --> 00:37:12,653
I know what to do.

227
00:37:13,592 --> 00:37:17,582
To solve this, we must get going

228
00:37:17,717 --> 00:37:18,689
Robin

229
00:37:24,456 --> 00:37:26,066
C'mon Robin.

230
00:37:26,435 --> 00:37:28,246
We're going to Altan's house.

231
00:37:45,378 --> 00:37:47,893
Now, it's all messed up, Robin.

232
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,301
He's killed

233
00:37:56,465 --> 00:37:58,077
The other one's killed.

234
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,215
This one's killed as well.

235
00:38:00,775 --> 00:38:02,748
-So, what do we do now?

236
00:38:04,952 --> 00:38:06,433
-Let's go to the company.

237
00:38:09,294 --> 00:38:12,814
-4 more people must die for us to reach our goal.

238
00:38:12,946 --> 00:38:15,610
You'll deal with Emel, like you did with Funda.

239
00:38:15,775 --> 00:38:18,965
Only, we must capture the important hints from her.

240
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,597
-You don't worry about it, chief.

241
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:25,380
The best man for this job is me, Ceyhan.

242
00:38:30,511 --> 00:38:33,044
-I planned the rest flawlessly.

243
00:38:33,406 --> 00:38:35,741
I guess there will be no mistakes.

244
00:38:37,452 --> 00:38:40,346
And we have already reached the end.

245
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:49,754
-You're welcome. Who are you looking for.

246
00:38:49,886 --> 00:38:51,728
-Is your name Emel?
-Yes.

247
00:38:52,846 --> 00:38:55,379
-I have come here to talk about a proposition.

248
00:38:55,445 --> 00:38:56,498
-Of course. Let's have a seat.

249
00:39:03,471 --> 00:39:04,754
-Would you want anything to drink?

250
00:39:05,088 --> 00:39:06,897
-If it won't be a trouble, yes.

251
00:39:15,384 --> 00:39:16,437
-Here you go.

252
00:39:16,536 --> 00:39:17,457
-Merci

253
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:24,628
I'm coming from the insurance company.

254
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:28,805
-If you've come here to sell an insurance
to me, you whouldn't have bothered.

255
00:39:29,134 --> 00:39:33,147
-Look, there is a lot of things 
beneficial for you. Let me explain.

256
00:39:33,279 --> 00:39:35,450
-Don't bother. I'll never do it

257
00:39:35,582 --> 00:39:37,555
-Oh, my head.

258
00:39:37,621 --> 00:39:39,365
-What is it? What happened?

259
00:39:41,272 --> 00:39:45,417
-I just felt dizzy. Do you have any 
medicine for nausea and dizziness?

260
00:39:45,467 --> 00:39:47,013
-It must be. Let me have a look.

261
00:39:53,165 --> 00:39:55,401
-This might help, I guess. Take it.

262
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:58,954
-Thank you.

263
00:40:01,684 --> 00:40:02,803
You should drink it.

264
00:42:53,693 --> 00:42:56,687
-Things are going according to my plans, darling

265
00:42:56,785 --> 00:43:02,674
If the boys succeed the last part 
as well, we will have a good fortune

266
00:43:02,724 --> 00:43:04,862
And then, hello to Beirut.

267
00:43:05,092 --> 00:43:06,704
-So, what about me?

268
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:08,612
-You will come with me too.

269
00:43:08,678 --> 00:43:10,586
-But I don't want another women.

270
00:43:10,651 --> 00:43:15,224
When we get there, I want to 
have a life only with you, darling.

271
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:17,033
-Don't you ever worry, sweetheart.

272
00:43:17,099 --> 00:43:19,533
You will be my only woman.

273
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:22,165
We will be living in a great fortune.

274
00:43:22,296 --> 00:43:26,178
Now, let's drink for our upcoming happy days.

275
00:43:35,454 --> 00:43:39,368
Well, well... Are you a dream or a fairy?

276
00:43:39,796 --> 00:43:41,638
-I'm not either a fairy or a dream.

277
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:43,857
-I'm only a mankind.

278
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:45,502
-A mankind?

279
00:43:47,673 --> 00:43:49,943
Aren't you supposed to be womankind?

280
00:43:50,009 --> 00:43:51,324


281
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:53,495
-You are so witty.

282
00:43:54,088 --> 00:43:55,206
-It looks that way.

283
00:43:57,410 --> 00:43:59,416
-What are you looking for here?
-Love.

284
00:43:59,647 --> 00:44:02,903
Let's not waste our 
time. How do you want it?

285
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,765
-Up in the hole.

286
00:44:23,517 --> 00:44:24,669
-You!

287
00:44:24,932 --> 00:44:26,807
are the girl I saw in Altar's house.

288
00:44:27,103 --> 00:44:28,386
Now, I get it.

289
00:44:28,715 --> 00:44:30,886
Tell me! What are you up to?

290
00:44:31,083 --> 00:44:32,300
Tell me!

291
00:44:41,675 --> 00:44:42,662
Yes.

292
00:45:26,695 --> 00:45:29,227
Tell me! Who do you work for?

293
00:45:29,326 --> 00:45:31,102
Who's the chief? Tell me.

294
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,096
-Don't hit me. I'll tell you.

295
00:45:34,293 --> 00:45:35,741
Let me have a smoke first.

296
00:54:33,307 --> 00:54:34,393
-Tell me!

297
00:54:34,492 --> 00:54:37,452
Who killed the girl, tell me! Why did you kill her?

298
00:54:54,414 --> 00:54:55,532
-Yes, it's me.

299
00:54:58,065 --> 00:54:59,710
-Okay, okay. Very well.

300
00:55:00,006 --> 00:55:01,585
Okay, I'll get it done.

301
00:55:03,361 --> 00:55:04,809
Right, right. I'll do it.

302
00:55:05,401 --> 00:55:07,111
Okay, fine. Goodbye.

303
00:55:30,796 --> 00:55:32,177
-Yes, I'm listening.

304
00:55:34,387 --> 00:55:35,834
I'm sending it right away.

305
00:55:37,611 --> 00:55:39,584
Send a crew immediately.

306
00:55:39,683 --> 00:55:40,834
Be quick.
-Yes, sir.

307
00:56:04,816 --> 00:56:05,747
-It's you!

308
00:56:05,966 --> 00:56:08,137
-Yes, It's me.

309
00:56:08,433 --> 00:56:09,913
-Weren't you murdered?

310
00:56:11,179 --> 00:56:13,415
-Don't worry. I didn't rise from the dead.

311
00:56:14,994 --> 00:56:16,277
-So, you didn't die!

312
00:56:17,001 --> 00:56:18,580
-I didn't, madam.

313
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:21,310
-Did you kill all nine of them?

314
00:56:21,836 --> 00:56:23,448
-No. All eight of them.

315
00:56:23,646 --> 00:56:25,356
Because I didn't die.

316
00:56:25,685 --> 00:56:29,271
I played dead to get the money from insurance.

317
00:56:29,501 --> 00:56:33,448
And after I have you, I will kill you too.

318
00:56:34,665 --> 00:56:36,442
Come here. Come...

319
00:56:36,705 --> 00:56:38,317
You just can't run away!

320
00:56:38,777 --> 00:56:39,896
-Let me go!

321
00:56:41,475 --> 00:56:43,876
-No matter how you resist, you'll be mine.

322
00:57:02,166 --> 00:57:04,468
You'll be mine! Mine!

323
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:24,471
-Congratulations, Betmen!

324
01:01:24,794 --> 01:01:32,425
-We are very proud of you for both saving our compony 
from bankruptcy and saving our nation from these evil people.

325
01:01:41,669 --> 01:01:45,419
The end.
