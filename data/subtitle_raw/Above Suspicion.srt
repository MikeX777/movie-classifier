1
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:10,268
Right there on your right.
That's good. Stay in the car.

2
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:13,642
<i>This is 2L13. We'll be 10-10 at Water at Pier 16.</i>

3
00:00:13,713 --> 00:00:16,773
<i>License 2, Tom, Edward, Mary, 385.</i>

4
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,083
<i>10-4, 2L13.</i>

5
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:23,020
<i>That's a 10-10 on 2, Tom, Edward, Mary, 385.</i>

6
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:26,954
Hold on a sec.

7
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,465
Can I see your license, please?

8
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:45,311
- What do we got?
- Rodriguez and Baker.

9
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:46,970
- When?
- About a half-hour ago.

10
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,912
- Who's Baker?
- New guy. You met him.

11
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:51,382
What, a rookie?
We had two boots in the same car?

12
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:54,079
Look, the cavalry has arrived.

13
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:56,753
- 14763.
- All clear.

14
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:58,290
Demps.

15
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:03,623
Routine shakedown. Thought they were
doping in the car. Three shooters.

16
00:01:03,696 --> 00:01:07,223
- Our guys screw up?
- Rodriguez was searching for his flashlight.

17
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,133
So you had two rookies in the same car.
That's criminal.

18
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:13,331
Rhinehart, want to come over here
for a second?

19
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:18,744
You. Yeah, you guys.
It's a crime scene, not a social gathering.

20
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:22,376
- I want Demps to take this.
- Matt, I'm up.

21
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:25,110
I want Demps to take this
and you to help him out.

22
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:26,340
Help him out?

23
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:29,684
If it's a gang, Alan should do it.
He's been covering these guys.

24
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,951
You assigning the cases? That's my job.

25
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:35,222
Listen, Matt, I'm set up with these guys.
I got a man in there.

26
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:37,923
Excuse me. Where are you going?

27
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:41,565
The coroner hasn't come yet. Just relax.

28
00:01:58,351 --> 00:01:59,909
Where's his badge?

29
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,149
Anybody touch this body?

30
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:06,685
- Where's his badge?
- Little fucks. They took it as a trophy.

31
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:14,466
- Let's dust right here.
- You can't get a print off concrete.

32
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:17,128
- Bring down the portable laser.
- Come on.

33
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:21,833
Ricky, call the lab, bring them down,
and rotamine two feet around the body.

34
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:24,936
Alan.

35
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:30,808
Let's work together on this.

36
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:34,018
- Whatever.
- I'd like to bring my brother in on it.

37
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:36,954
Get him loaned to our division
to help us in the legwork.

38
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:38,581
It's your party.

39
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:46,061
- What's going on?
- Same old, same old. Let's go.

40
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:24,566
- What are you doing?
- I just gotta see.

41
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:31,310
- It's Dempsey.
- For Christ's sake.

42
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,308
What are you doing?

43
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,372
I'm going to check my machine.
It might be important.

44
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,421
Don't worry.

45
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,217
I'm not going anywhere.

46
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:50,722
'Cause I'm undercover.

47
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:11,881
Hey, kid. So, where you been?

48
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:14,181
- Why?
- I paged you.

49
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,251
- I didn't get it.
- Didn't get it?

50
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:20,122
No. You know, I was kind of tied up.

51
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,929
I bet you were. I left word on your machine.

52
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:26,830
I just walked in. So what's up? Want a beer?

53
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:29,693
6:00 in the morning? I'll pass, thanks.

54
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,870
So tell me, what did I miss?

55
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:35,932
There's a cop down.
I was trying to bring you in on it.

56
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:40,138
- Look, just return your phone calls, okay?
- I know.

57
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,480
It's the women. I have no self-control.

58
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:47,675
Look, I'll take you to breakfast,
and you can bring me up to speed.

59
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:49,847
No, I gotta go home and get some sleep.

60
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:52,413
Come on. Let me take you to breakfast.

61
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:55,690
- I gotta get some sleep.
- Okay.

62
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:58,894
Listen, can I borrow $20 anyway?

63
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:12,409
- Hey there, what are you doing up?
- Couldn't sleep.

64
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:13,968
Yeah? Why not?

65
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:16,880
I'm in a slump. I haven't reached in four games.

66
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,642
What's the problem?

67
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:20,514
Not concentrating?

68
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:24,215
That's up to you. 'Cause you control
where your mind goes, right?

69
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:27,052
You just got to focus on one thing.

70
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:30,021
The ball.

71
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:33,657
If you're thinking about whether you'll get a hit,
you won't get a hit.

72
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:38,331
The power that you have to direct your mind
is the greatest power you have.

73
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:42,106
So I put my attention on the ball?

74
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,570
There you go.

75
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,873
Now you're talking.

76
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:52,310
I'll see you later. I'm gonna get some sleep.

77
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,356
I love you.

78
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:28,478
- What did he say?
- Who?

79
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:32,354
Capt. Cocksucker's got such a hard on
for Dempsey, it's embarrassing.

80
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:34,518
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm drinking.

81
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:38,086
- Then I'm transferring the fuck out of here.
- He's good, Alan.

82
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:42,232
Did you hear he got a print off the concrete
last night? Those two rookies?

83
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:46,095
You got the instincts.
You were born for this shit.

84
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:50,700
But he's a college guy.
He's up on all that technical stuff.

85
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,800
He's good.

86
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:55,204
Fuck good. He's a politician.

87
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:59,884
Mr. Navy, test pilot, brown-nosing,
cocksucking Boy Scout.

88
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,653
And don't get me started on his brother.

89
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:04,815
- Moron.
- Guys like that...

90
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:07,689
- End up police commissioner.
- Really.

91
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:09,760
Yeah.

92
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:16,190
We should get back by 12:00
to get changed and go to the wake at 1:00.

93
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,294
Or we could go to the wake later.

94
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:21,670
We planned at 3:00 to go to Bruce
and Nancy's to see the new house.

95
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:24,574
Maybe you can go to the wake without me.

96
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:26,475
He was a cop, Gail.

97
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:29,347
Well, I'm not a cop, Demps.

98
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:33,512
- Honey, this is all planned.
- Dad, can we do some batting today?

99
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:36,054
No way. You got to check the plan.

100
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,716
It's not on the schedule. Eat your breakfast.

101
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,786
What's with her?

102
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:44,523
That's not a her, that's your mom.

103
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:59,437
Let's watch this thing a minute.
Let's just watch and concentrate.

104
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:03,612
Look. Boom. Right there. Then again.

105
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:07,912
You're just going to focus your mind.
One thing at a time.

106
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:10,488
Your eye never leaves it. Okay, go ahead.

107
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:14,924
Walk up to it. Eye on it.

108
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:17,823
Focus in.

109
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:20,421
Yes!

110
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:25,293
Dude. Yeah. All right.

111
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:27,529
Boom. Goodbye, see you.

112
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:30,637
Go ask her.

113
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:34,746
Come out back, I made something.

114
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:36,805
I'm tired. I'll see it tomorrow.

115
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:41,210
- Please, Mom.
- I will see it tomorrow.

116
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:44,256
You got to. It'll just take a second.

117
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:48,384
Listen to me. I'm not in the mood for this.
Will you stop pulling my arm?

118
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:51,092
- What?
- Surprise!

119
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:58,260
Happy birthday, darling.

120
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,895
What's wrong?

121
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:02,839
Good job, Damon. Happy birthday, my love.

122
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,506
It's not my birthday until Tuesday.

123
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:08,672
If we waited till Tuesday,
you wouldn't be surprised.

124
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:10,510
What's that, right there?

125
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:14,076
- You like it?
- She loves it.

126
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:16,053
It's perfect.

127
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:22,790
Let me get the door.

128
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:25,894
Let me take your pictures. Get in there.

129
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:27,899
Mom.

130
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:29,467
Okay.

131
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:31,894
Smile.

132
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:40,805
It's the truth. She's lying there in the tub,
naked with her toe stuck in the faucet.

133
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,541
- Were you surprised?
- Totally.

134
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:49,818
He's been planning it for months.

135
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:52,756
Ripping out the faucet.
They cut away the back of the wall.

136
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:54,486
It's perfect, isn't it?

137
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,528
Everything Dempsey does is perfect.

138
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:02,534
And we finally put her and about
200 pounds of masonry on a stretcher...

139
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,628
...took her right out
through a cocktail party in the lobby.

140
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:15,378
Hello?

141
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:18,347
What? I can't hear you.

142
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:21,752
Okay. All right. Good.

143
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:24,255
Ricky, we got to roll.

144
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:26,621
- What's up?
- They found our shooters.

145
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:28,421
Where's Nick?

146
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:34,263
Nicky.

147
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,795
Please, this isn't safe.

148
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:39,970
Happy birthday.

149
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:46,908
Can you find Nicky and tell him
to meet us at that address soon?

150
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,607
- All right.
- Tell Gail we had to leave. Thanks.

151
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:02,419
They're on the third floor.

152
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,622
What's around them?

153
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:09,059
This guy over here is the super.
He only speaks Spanish.

154
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:13,002
Ricky, go see what we got.
Third floor, that's what I'm worried about.

155
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:15,764
- Get him the sketches of the floor plan.
- Right.

156
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,053
- Who called the beetles in?
- I did.

157
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:32,621
Get rid of them. Get them out of here.

158
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:36,386
We got five armed crack heads.
I don't think we've got to be heroes.

159
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:40,865
We've got a residential hotel full of people.
This is our case. We can handle it.

160
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:42,860
All right.

161
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:45,960
Our pals are in 313.
Super says there's five of them.

162
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:50,202
We've got three occupied rooms
on the third floor, 306, 312 and 315.

163
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,840
312 is just down the hall. She's old.

164
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:57,549
Where can we get a pizza?

165
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:13,029
Pizza.

166
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:18,364
Open the door.

167
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:27,869
Is that a search warrant? I'll take that.

168
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:17,524
Let's go.

169
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,295
Police!

170
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,503
I got the broad.

171
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:37,940
Get down!

172
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:42,353
- You okay?
- Vest.

173
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,855
Get out of there.

174
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,659
Shut up!

175
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,657
Behind your back.

176
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:54,927
Go!

177
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,304
- Andale, cabron.
- Freeze!

178
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,673
Dame una razon, you sick motherfucker.

179
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:11,279
You don't kill cops.

180
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,211
How many we got total?

181
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,686
Move, damn it!

182
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:20,224
There's one more. The super said five.

183
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:24,286
- Randy?
- Yeah?

184
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:28,891
- We're secure here.
- Whatever comes out of that hole, shoot it.

185
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:31,528
I think I know where he went. Come on.

186
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:39,643
Go!

187
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,442
- Freeze, police!
- Don't anybody move.

188
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:47,275
- Nothing.
- We're all clear here.

189
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:48,511
Nick?

190
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,989
Nobody.

191
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:58,596
- I guess there was only four.
- I don't get it.

192
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,915
Mrs. Cain, he has what we call
some sacral sparing...

193
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:27,951
...meaning only partial,
not complete, damage to his spinal cord.

194
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:33,154
At this point, there's no telling if or when
he'll recover the use of his legs.

195
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:35,720
I'm sorry.

196
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:42,893
Then the next thing I know,
I'm flat-assed on the floor.

197
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:44,799
I think I even said, "I'm shot."

198
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:47,361
No, actually, what you said was:

199
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:50,339
"What are you looking at me for?
Go shoot him."

200
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:54,638
What's this about a beeper going off?

201
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:57,605
Well, I got a phone call.

202
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,480
- What?
- Yeah, I forgot to turn it off.

203
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:03,144
Your beeper? I was under the impression...

204
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:04,849
It was my beeper.

205
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,685
Jesus, Dempsey.

206
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:08,817
- That's harsh.
- Yeah, I know.

207
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:11,692
I tell her all the time, "Don't call me at work."

208
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:16,190
Do we want to hear the spec,
or have we had enough?

209
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:19,431
I've had enough. Besides, I'm hungry.

210
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:22,229
Where can you get a good steak around here?

211
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,707
Excuse me, quick question.

212
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:33,714
How sick would a guy have to be
to have you as the night nurse?

213
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:36,417
That sick?

214
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:48,156
How you doing?

215
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:52,635
Wait till you see what I got for you.

216
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:55,804
I got tacos, burritos...

217
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:58,775
...chimichangas, and...

218
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:02,372
...Petrone.
- Nick?

219
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:05,473
I was just shot by a Mexican.

220
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:09,746
I knew it, something was telling me Chinese,
but I'm so stubborn.

221
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:13,623
Tell me, how are you doing?

222
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,828
I'm paralyzed.

223
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:23,157
Only from the waist down. How are you?

224
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:26,502
Demps...

225
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:32,238
...I read your deposition,
you didn't have to do that.

226
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:35,479
- You're my brother.
- I know, but...

227
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:37,208
You're my brother.

228
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:40,277
End of story. You'd do it for me.

229
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,924
- That's good.
- Yeah.

230
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:55,396
- Just like that.
- Let go.

231
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:58,095
Roll right down. Good.

232
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,572
I'm going to put this stirrup on your foot.

233
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:06,873
- I want you to lift your foot. Pull.
- That's pretty good.

234
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:09,038
There you go. Good job.

235
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:12,748
Hi. Call me. I just got back.

236
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:15,509
I spent the whole morning at the hospital.

237
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:17,688
Really depressing.

238
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,050
Da's staying over at a friend's house, so...

239
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:23,755
...l'm here.

240
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:36,332
We got six months of this. Slow down.

241
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:48,206
Two more.

242
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,280
Now give me some curls.

243
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,487
Again.

244
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:04,059
Demps?

245
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:10,667
It's late.

246
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,281
Mom? Dad? Want to eat something?

247
00:21:26,184 --> 00:21:27,549
In here.

248
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,622
Dad?

249
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:37,555
Hi.

250
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:09,956
What?

251
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:20,733
You wanna?

252
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:28,836
We could try.

253
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,746
What do you say?

254
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,091
I'll help you.

255
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:11,120
His actions uphold the highest tradition...

256
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:13,555
...of the San Sebastian police department...

257
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:18,119
...and are hereby recognized
by awarding him the medal of valor.

258
00:23:49,394 --> 00:23:52,386
- We miss you, take care.
- Thanks.

259
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:58,968
Congratulations.

260
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:03,939
Now you could write books or something.

261
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:07,441
Detective stories.
Sell them to TV, and make a lot of money.

262
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:15,884
Look, I'll try to keep an eye out for your brother.

263
00:24:19,357 --> 00:24:20,881
Yeah, thanks.

264
00:24:22,727 --> 00:24:24,217
I'll see you around.

265
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:56,553
Why is your equipment sitting
at the bottom of our pool?

266
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,188
Have I let you down?

267
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:06,226
Demps, you have to stop this.

268
00:25:07,105 --> 00:25:09,539
I've just realized how unhappy you are.

269
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:13,200
You used to be happy.

270
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:18,282
Hell, I remember when we were stationed
at Pax River. We had that apartment.

271
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,113
And you were dancing.

272
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,084
Why did you quit dancing?

273
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:27,186
You were really good.

274
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:30,388
Well, being good in Maryland
isn't good enough.

275
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:32,589
- Listen...
- Did I neglect you or something?

276
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:35,895
- Let's not go into this.
- Is that it? Have I neglected you?

277
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:40,094
You're drunk, you're depressed,
and it's late, and just for the record...

278
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:43,103
...I am not unhappy.

279
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:49,806
I think we ought to send Damon away
to camp this summer.

280
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:51,577
Okay.

281
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,318
Does Damon want to go to camp?

282
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:57,216
I don't want him to stay around here when I'm...

283
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,751
...like this.

284
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:06,222
- All right, I'll talk to him.
- I'm sorry.

285
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:08,627
For what?

286
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:13,561
For letting you down.

287
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:17,397
Would you stop that? You haven't let me down.

288
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:20,538
Jesus, Demps.

289
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:36,486
- Just say it, Nick.
- I am.

290
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:39,695
It just doesn't seem right anymore,
since Demps...

291
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:41,898
...you know.

292
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,193
I mean, I'm talking about for me.

293
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:47,465
That's great, Nick, that's just great.

294
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:50,774
Want to know what I come home to at night?

295
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:55,107
A pool full of exercise equipment
and a depressed hulk in a wheelchair.

296
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,772
Come on, Gail.

297
00:26:56,848 --> 00:26:58,679
He's drunk every night.

298
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:01,810
- He's going through a hard thing.
- What about me?

299
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:05,389
I'm looking at pushing a wheelchair
for the rest of my life.

300
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:08,358
I am 35 years old, for Christ's sake.

301
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:10,121
Who gets the BLT?

302
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:13,391
Here.

303
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:18,966
Enjoy.

304
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:24,667
- Ready?
- I guess so.

305
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,957
I'm your partner.

306
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:43,851
I'll always be your partner.
That's what you have to remember.

307
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:47,193
- I still don't want to go to camp.
- Yeah, I know, pal.

308
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:50,024
You gotta give me some time.

309
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,962
We're out of here.

310
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:56,634
I love you, Dad.

311
00:27:58,276 --> 00:27:59,675
Have fun.

312
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:03,381
- Drive carefully.
- Yeah.

313
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:07,617
I'll call you tonight.

314
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:42,785
Oh, my God.

315
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:52,830
Hi. Do you have any lentils?

316
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:56,833
'Cause I'm making lentil soup,
and I was halfway through making the...

317
00:28:56,901 --> 00:29:01,634
...stock and I realized I didn't have any.
I was wondering if I might borrow some...

318
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:04,871
...or any other sort of bean that you might have.

319
00:29:08,346 --> 00:29:11,440
$2,795,000, plus they'll take back paper.

320
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:17,084
I can't present that. Because it's insulting.

321
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:21,625
Okay. Well, let me get back to you.

322
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:22,952
Bye.

323
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:29,892
- How are you?
- Okay.

324
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,300
Sit down.

325
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:39,810
- You want to buy a house?
- No, thanks.

326
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:46,545
This may be none of my business,
but I think there is something you should know.

327
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:53,015
- Jesus Christ. When?
- When I took Damon.

328
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:55,116
- Jesus.
- He's fine now.

329
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:57,161
- Is he alone?
- Lois is with him.

330
00:29:57,228 --> 00:30:00,095
The therapist said that his feelings
could come up.

331
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:02,495
We gotta get him some help.

332
00:30:04,235 --> 00:30:05,224
What?

333
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:09,672
I don't know. It's just really hard.
Dempsey's not a wheelchair kind of guy.

334
00:30:10,074 --> 00:30:11,541
What are you saying?

335
00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:13,774
I don't know. It's just...

336
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,011
It's his life.

337
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:19,345
The guy is a total perfectionist.

338
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:22,545
If his life isn't perfect, I don't know if he wants it.

339
00:30:22,787 --> 00:30:25,950
The guy's depressed, Gail, clinically depressed.

340
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:29,489
- I'm talking to the shrink tomorrow.
- No, I will.

341
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:32,186
I gotta get back to the office.

342
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:37,467
You mad at me?

343
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:02,055
What are you doing?
Aren't you supposed to be on duty?

344
00:31:03,561 --> 00:31:05,426
Demps called. He...

345
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:08,592
...wanted to speak to the two of us.

346
00:31:11,502 --> 00:31:12,799
About?

347
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:16,440
We've been waiting for you to get home.

348
00:31:17,575 --> 00:31:19,167
Well, here I am.

349
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:24,144
Does anybody wanna have a drink, besides me?

350
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:26,974
Some vodka.

351
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:30,520
- You're on duty.
- Kidding. Just kidding.

352
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,936
The other night I tried to kill myself.

353
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,108
Oh, my God.

354
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:53,401
All I could think of was Damon.

355
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:56,379
What's going to happen to him?

356
00:31:57,215 --> 00:31:59,115
What am I leaving him with?

357
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:03,248
I always thought I was a good role model to him.

358
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,690
In his eyes I see...

359
00:32:07,191 --> 00:32:09,716
...discomfort, pity.

360
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:15,592
And then something inside me has...

361
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:17,191
...died.

362
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,997
We'll get you some counseling.

363
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:21,334
It's all right. I have counseling.

364
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:24,273
I'm very clear about this.

365
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,410
I want to die.

366
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:30,512
I can't live my life as half a man.

367
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:32,781
It's not fair...

368
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:35,917
...to me or Damon.

369
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:39,652
Certainly not to you, Gail.

370
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:44,293
I didn't ask you here to discuss this.

371
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:48,294
I'm gonna end my life,
and I need your help to do it.

372
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,265
Now, I've...

373
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:56,865
...taken out a $1-million insurance policy.

374
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:02,344
It pays double if I die an accidental death.

375
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:06,742
You two and Damon are the beneficiaries.

376
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:12,183
Of course there's the department policy,
but none of this covers suicide.

377
00:33:12,523 --> 00:33:16,220
What are we going to do,
push you in the pool and watch you drown?

378
00:33:16,294 --> 00:33:18,057
Come on.

379
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:23,393
- I need to drink. I don't give a shit.
- I'm asking you to help me.

380
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:30,832
I am asking you to help me
secure my son's future...

381
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,834
...and yours.

382
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:39,441
I've worked this all out to the last detail.
There won't be any risk on your part.

383
00:33:39,717 --> 00:33:42,743
We'll stage a burglary.
I'll be killed in the process.

384
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:50,323
I realize the magnitude
of what I'm asking you to do, so...

385
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:53,323
...don't answer me now. Just think about it.

386
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:35,973
I think I understand how you're feeling.

387
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:38,942
I think I do.

388
00:34:42,713 --> 00:34:45,204
But I don't know if I can do this for you.

389
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:17,842
You park the rental car in that lot,
right over there.

390
00:35:17,915 --> 00:35:19,940
You'll have to change the plates.

391
00:35:20,017 --> 00:35:23,783
Everything will be in the trunk,
and the theater's two blocks away.

392
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:30,619
You need to get a time-punched ticket
at the parking lot.

393
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:33,687
Inside the theatre,
cause a commotion so you're remembered.

394
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:37,325
<i>Then at 10:45 go out that side exit,
right over there.</i>

395
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:40,437
Be sure you rig the door so you can get back in.

396
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:56,176
Break this glass and unlock the door.

397
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,888
Muffle the sound with tape and rags.

398
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:03,518
The lawn will be wet from the sprinklers,
you'll be leaving prints all over the place.

399
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:09,463
Then start at opposite sides of the room,
put everything to be stolen into bags.

400
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:12,661
Get the guns out of the drawer, right there.

401
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:15,536
Then I'll hear you, and I'll come in...

402
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:20,842
...and Nick you shoot me once,
in the side of the head at close range.

403
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:24,973
I don't want to see it. That should do it.

404
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:29,118
If it doesn't, Gail,
you shoot me twice in the heart.

405
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:32,053
Don't hesitate, I don't wanna suffer.

406
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:36,123
Then you tip the wheelchair over on its side...

407
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:39,095
...you get rid of all the stuff,
the way we talked about.

408
00:36:39,163 --> 00:36:42,132
Come back, you discover my body,
you call the police.

409
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:47,698
Honey?

410
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,807
You all right?

411
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,146
This is just too bizarre.

412
00:37:05,022 --> 00:37:08,514
Wouldn't you love to play
hide the salami with her?

413
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:14,097
Nick wants to play hide the salami with Iris.
Think you can set him up?

414
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:16,423
I was just kidding around.

415
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:20,228
But seriously, what about the shots?

416
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:23,239
- Won't the neighbors hear them?
- No, you'll use silencers.

417
00:37:23,307 --> 00:37:27,334
- It'll look like a professional hit.
- Illegals use anything they can get.

418
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:29,777
The films at the theatre, we'll need to see them.

419
00:37:29,847 --> 00:37:32,008
You can go to a video store and rent them.

420
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:35,348
Is that a good idea? That's our alibi.

421
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:38,519
- Won't it leave a trace?
- Why don't we go to the movies?

422
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:41,422
- Bad idea.
- Stupid idea.

423
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:44,187
I'll take care of the videos. What else?

424
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:47,694
- How are you gonna do it?
- I'll come up with something.

425
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:49,465
What else?

426
00:37:50,801 --> 00:37:53,292
Okay, we're gonna do it in two weeks...

427
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:55,367
...Friday, July 15.

428
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:59,904
But if anything doesn't go according to plan,
we abort.

429
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:06,973
Let's get started.

430
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:20,225
Detective Porado. It's Gail Cain.

431
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:24,458
Hey, Ricky, it's Gail.

432
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:28,161
Listen, this is probably nothing,
but I thought I'd better call.

433
00:38:29,273 --> 00:38:32,106
We were followed home today from the bank.

434
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:35,541
Yeah. I think there were two of them.

435
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,077
Two Mexicans, I think.

436
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:59,496
- I'll meet you here in half an hour.
- I'll watch all day for you.

437
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:14,140
Cuàntos dos chaquetas, por favor?

438
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:29,390
Hey, buddy.

439
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,933
<i>I'm looking for Senor De La Paz.</i>

440
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:38,441
- Jorge De La Paz?
- No here, wrong place.

441
00:39:41,078 --> 00:39:42,909
My name is Carpenter.

442
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:47,209
- You called me.
- No.

443
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,249
Franco.

444
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:13,737
- Where's your friend?
- That's none of your business.

445
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:17,269
- I like to know who I am working for.
- You're working for me.

446
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:19,509
- You have money?
- Right here.

447
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:21,380
Stand on the line.

448
00:40:27,158 --> 00:40:29,023
Look at the red light.

449
00:40:30,294 --> 00:40:32,125
A couple of minutes.

450
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:38,030
- You have license information?
- Yep.

451
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:47,177
I make silencers.

452
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:52,173
- Nice.
- You try, over there. Shoot.

453
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,895
Okay. Looks good.

454
00:41:20,744 --> 00:41:23,577
- $3,000.
- Dempsey said $2,000.

455
00:41:23,714 --> 00:41:25,079
Who?

456
00:41:25,182 --> 00:41:27,047
My friend said $2,000.

457
00:41:27,117 --> 00:41:29,551
$800 for each gun and $400 for the license.

458
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:32,487
- $3,000.
- Hold on there, Josè.

459
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:35,022
$2,000 is the deal, and that's all I got.

460
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:37,958
- Fuck you. Go down the street.
- Bullshit.

461
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:42,489
Grease ball.

462
00:42:27,511 --> 00:42:29,638
- Gail, let's go.
- What's wrong?

463
00:42:29,747 --> 00:42:31,908
Nothing. Just get in the car.

464
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:46,024
No, gracias.

465
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:55,962
What's that on your shirt?

466
00:42:56,507 --> 00:42:57,872
Shit.

467
00:43:00,144 --> 00:43:01,611
Afternoon.

468
00:43:01,812 --> 00:43:03,143
Hi.

469
00:43:03,213 --> 00:43:05,579
How long have you folks been in Mexico?

470
00:43:06,016 --> 00:43:09,008
- Couple of hours. Doing some shopping.
- Where are you from?

471
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:10,644
San Sebastian.

472
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:13,717
Can I see your driver's license, sir?

473
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:15,782
Yeah, sure.

474
00:43:25,502 --> 00:43:27,402
All right. Have a good day.

475
00:43:27,471 --> 00:43:29,029
Thanks.

476
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:36,538
- You what?
- It wasn't my fault.

477
00:43:37,314 --> 00:43:39,214
- Nick.
- He hit his head.

478
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,078
I think I killed him.

479
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:44,248
Christ.

480
00:43:44,321 --> 00:43:47,017
- We gotta abort.
- No, wait.

481
00:43:47,091 --> 00:43:50,117
- He said, "If anything went wrong..."
- You said you were alone.

482
00:43:50,194 --> 00:43:51,718
- Yes.
- Are you sure?

483
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:54,195
- And you got everything on that list?
- Yes.

484
00:43:54,264 --> 00:43:56,061
- Well then, maybe it's okay.
- No!

485
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:58,294
Dempsey said, "If anything went wrong..."

486
00:43:58,369 --> 00:44:00,064
Shut up. Okay?

487
00:44:02,206 --> 00:44:04,174
We gotta figure this out.

488
00:44:06,677 --> 00:44:08,872
This is what Dempsey wants.

489
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:17,650
"Bonds of restriction are broken.

490
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:20,281
"Decisions are reached concerning
beginnings or endings.

491
00:44:20,357 --> 00:44:23,258
"Realize discretion
actually is better part of valor.

492
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:24,692
"Travel involved."

493
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:39,766
What are you doing?

494
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:43,475
Just gathering up some of Dempsey's stuff.

495
00:44:44,782 --> 00:44:47,012
- You working tonight?
- Yeah.

496
00:44:47,117 --> 00:44:49,017
Great. I'll get you assigned to me.

497
00:44:49,086 --> 00:44:51,384
Tonight, no. I'm off tonight.

498
00:44:53,123 --> 00:44:55,250
You want to get in some OT?

499
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:58,518
I'm going to the movies, actually.

500
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:02,562
- So how is your brother?
- Demps?

501
00:45:04,168 --> 00:45:06,762
- Yeah.
- He's great.

502
00:45:15,245 --> 00:45:17,213
Think about this for a second.

503
00:45:17,281 --> 00:45:20,216
This man carries a loaded weapon.

504
00:45:26,924 --> 00:45:28,516
- Hello?
- Hi, Damon.

505
00:45:28,692 --> 00:45:31,320
- Hi, Dad.
- How are you doing? How's camp?

506
00:45:31,528 --> 00:45:34,292
- Pretty good.
- Yeah? Did you get any hits?

507
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:36,992
- A couple.
- That's good.

508
00:45:37,267 --> 00:45:38,825
That's really good.

509
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:42,898
Well, look, don't let me keep you. I just...

510
00:45:43,507 --> 00:45:45,475
...called, I just wanted...

511
00:45:46,977 --> 00:45:48,239
...to say hi.

512
00:45:49,046 --> 00:45:50,980
I'm thinking about you, and...

513
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:55,975
...I love you, Damon.
- I love you, too, Dad.

514
00:45:58,155 --> 00:46:00,055
- Bye.
- See you.

515
00:46:16,874 --> 00:46:19,434
- I'll need your credit card.
- I'm paying cash.

516
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:22,070
Cash? You'll have to leave a $500 deposit.

517
00:46:25,983 --> 00:46:29,180
All right. I'll need a valid
California driver's license.

518
00:46:33,423 --> 00:46:36,153
- You're making a copy of my license?
- I have to.

519
00:46:37,494 --> 00:46:40,122
- I get that back when I return the car?
- Sure.

520
00:46:40,197 --> 00:46:42,188
It's a beige Ford LTD.

521
00:46:46,203 --> 00:46:49,104
Don't forget, if you're seen
leaving the theatre, you can it.

522
00:46:49,173 --> 00:46:50,504
- Yeah.
- Yes.

523
00:46:50,574 --> 00:46:52,701
Drive slow. Stay under the limit.

524
00:46:52,776 --> 00:46:56,872
- You don't have to be back to the theatre...
- We've been through this a thousand times.

525
00:46:56,947 --> 00:46:59,916
That's good. If you space out
on this one and get caught...

526
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:03,680
...you'll both get the death penalty,
and our son's going to be an orphan.

527
00:47:10,294 --> 00:47:12,194
All right, let's get started.

528
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:16,459
Be right back.

529
00:47:25,776 --> 00:47:27,266
Tell me something.

530
00:47:28,078 --> 00:47:29,773
What do you think of me?

531
00:47:33,317 --> 00:47:35,114
You're a great guy.

532
00:47:35,886 --> 00:47:37,376
You were a great cop.

533
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:40,818
You resent me at all?

534
00:47:42,292 --> 00:47:44,624
Resent you? No.

535
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:48,195
Resent you?

536
00:47:49,933 --> 00:47:53,096
I don't know. Maybe a little.

537
00:47:54,972 --> 00:47:57,372
- Why?
- Why?

538
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:01,173
Look at this house.

539
00:48:04,147 --> 00:48:06,047
Look at your career.

540
00:48:08,852 --> 00:48:11,548
We both inherit
the exact same amount of money.

541
00:48:11,755 --> 00:48:14,053
You invest and...

542
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:16,292
I invest and lose every dime.

543
00:48:16,927 --> 00:48:20,556
- In a nightclub.
- Some people get very rich in nightclubs.

544
00:48:21,698 --> 00:48:24,565
It's you, everything you touch.

545
00:48:24,835 --> 00:48:27,633
You're on the force
and make Detective 3 in 10 years.

546
00:48:27,704 --> 00:48:29,638
I'm six years now.

547
00:48:29,706 --> 00:48:32,539
I'm still in uniform, in spite of all your efforts.

548
00:48:36,446 --> 00:48:38,243
I'm a fuck-up.

549
00:48:39,216 --> 00:48:40,649
You know that.

550
00:48:42,352 --> 00:48:45,082
Why? Why is that?

551
00:48:46,023 --> 00:48:49,686
You don't try hard enough,
or you just can't do any better?

552
00:48:52,462 --> 00:48:54,054
I don't know.

553
00:49:05,509 --> 00:49:07,170
You scared?

554
00:49:08,312 --> 00:49:10,212
Only if something goes wrong.

555
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:14,783
You're not afraid of dying?

556
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:18,182
I'm more afraid of living.

557
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:23,156
I gotta tell you, bro...

558
00:49:24,928 --> 00:49:27,192
...what you're doing is really brave.

559
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,859
I promise I'll look after Gail...

560
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:34,769
...and Damon.

561
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:37,864
Yeah. I know.

562
00:49:40,277 --> 00:49:41,801
I promise.

563
00:49:55,892 --> 00:49:57,757
- Here you go.
- Thanks, pal.

564
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:04,124
A large buttered popcorn, please.

565
00:50:11,708 --> 00:50:13,938
- What is that stuff?
- Butter.

566
00:50:14,244 --> 00:50:17,736
- That's real butter?
- No, it's a butter-like topping.

567
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:22,174
No, you don't understand. I don't want
any of this golden-flavored shit.

568
00:50:22,252 --> 00:50:24,914
No, put it back. We're not paying for this.

569
00:50:24,988 --> 00:50:28,287
- lf you don't have butter...
- Is there a problem here?

570
00:50:30,894 --> 00:50:32,987
Yes, sir, there is.

571
00:51:52,976 --> 00:51:54,409
It's time.

572
00:53:21,331 --> 00:53:22,958
Any complications?

573
00:53:25,769 --> 00:53:27,168
No.

574
00:53:31,608 --> 00:53:32,905
Good.

575
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:42,575
Well, I guess this is it.

576
00:54:32,969 --> 00:54:34,869
I can't. I'm sorry.

577
00:54:35,705 --> 00:54:37,832
I'm sorry, man. I can't.

578
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:11,197
Oh, my God.

579
00:55:13,877 --> 00:55:15,435
What did you do?

580
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:18,713
Oh, my God.

581
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:23,714
- You were fucking her, weren't you?
- What?

582
00:55:24,387 --> 00:55:28,414
- You were fucking my wife.
- What? Nothing was going on.

583
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:31,221
What were you doing at my house
at 2:30 in the morning?

584
00:55:31,294 --> 00:55:33,956
- When?
- The night the rookie went down.

585
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:35,520
I tried to call you.

586
00:55:39,569 --> 00:55:42,197
- What did you do?
- Here it is.

587
00:55:42,572 --> 00:55:46,565
Here it is, the phone bill. The call
you made from here to your machine.

588
00:55:49,312 --> 00:55:53,578
She came on to me, man.
I ended it, I swear to God.

589
00:55:53,817 --> 00:55:56,945
It never really bothered me
that you were such a fuck-up...

590
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:59,614
...'cause you were my brother, and I loved you.

591
00:56:00,623 --> 00:56:03,854
But after all I've done for you, you betrayed me.

592
00:56:05,061 --> 00:56:06,756
And that I can't forgive.

593
00:56:16,139 --> 00:56:18,505
Man, did you set us up.

594
00:57:06,956 --> 00:57:08,389
Hold on, Officer.

595
00:57:10,527 --> 00:57:13,826
Run a check on all these cars.
Hit the next block, too.

596
00:57:16,032 --> 00:57:19,058
Okay, make sure you run this tape
all the way around the house.

597
00:57:19,135 --> 00:57:20,466
Talk to the neighbors.

598
00:57:20,537 --> 00:57:22,835
- Where is he?
- Inside.

599
00:57:27,744 --> 00:57:30,440
Look, let me try to do my job, will you please?

600
00:58:03,046 --> 00:58:04,604
They tried to kill me.

601
00:58:06,449 --> 00:58:08,576
They tried to kill me, Ricky.

602
00:58:15,058 --> 00:58:16,650
Who handled it?

603
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:20,486
A guy named Sutter. He did the investigation.

604
00:58:20,763 --> 00:58:24,096
<i>We borrowed him from the 15th.
It's pretty open-and-shut.</i>

605
00:58:25,034 --> 00:58:28,060
Justifiable cause. They left a trail a mile wide.

606
00:58:28,738 --> 00:58:32,265
Nick didn't have a criminal mind.
He certainly didn't have a cop's.

607
00:58:33,109 --> 00:58:34,542
Anyway...

608
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:42,083
I got some bad news.

609
00:58:46,256 --> 00:58:48,190
They were doing each other.

610
00:58:54,831 --> 00:58:56,128
God.

611
00:59:04,407 --> 00:59:07,137
- Ricky, do me a favor.
- Name it.

612
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:12,113
They want me to stay in here another day.
Damon's at camp, can you go pick him up?

613
00:59:12,282 --> 00:59:15,581
Sure, I'll go pick him up
first thing tomorrow morning.

614
00:59:24,627 --> 00:59:27,892
3:30. His son's in Brighton, Vista Hills.

615
00:59:28,531 --> 00:59:32,228
- Thanks very much.
- Rosa, take that into Dempsey. He won't eat.

616
00:59:32,302 --> 00:59:33,496
I'll take it in.

617
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:37,870
We've been trying to reach my brother
in Canada, but can't get a hold of him.

618
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:49,643
- Hi, Damon.
- What's going on? Where's Mom and Dad?

619
00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:52,017
- Tell Dempsey I had to take off.
- Yeah, sure.

620
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:54,181
Your dad's in the study, come on.

621
00:59:54,324 --> 00:59:57,259
- What about Nicky's stuff?
- Goodwill?

622
00:59:57,327 --> 01:00:00,785
I could box up some of his personal things
and bring them back.

623
01:00:01,331 --> 01:00:03,526
- Hi, Damon.
- What's going on?

624
01:00:05,501 --> 01:00:07,696
- We gotta get going.
- Yeah.

625
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:10,739
- We'll see you tomorrow.
- All right. Thanks for coming over.

626
01:00:10,807 --> 01:00:12,832
- No problem.
- Take it easy.

627
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:18,070
Laura says you've got to eat.

628
01:00:18,915 --> 01:00:21,679
- You hungry, Damon?
- No. What's going on, Dad?

629
01:00:38,601 --> 01:00:40,694
I mean, may he rest in peace.

630
01:00:40,903 --> 01:00:44,839
Fucking Nick, so stupid.
Arrested this whore, cuffs her...

631
01:00:44,941 --> 01:00:48,502
...locks her in the squad car with his keys.
- Get out of here.

632
01:00:48,578 --> 01:00:50,409
- Am I right, Alan?
- It's bullshit.

633
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,506
How many cops have taken a bullet
because these vests open up?

634
01:00:53,583 --> 01:00:56,746
You can't wear a suit of armor.
You gotta maneuver out there.

635
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:59,686
I have a family.
I don't want to end up in a wheelchair.

636
01:00:59,756 --> 01:01:01,314
Suicidal.

637
01:01:03,626 --> 01:01:06,618
- Demps is suicidal?
- Fucking A. Tried to eat his gun.

638
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:09,161
It's in the report. Sutter told me.

639
01:01:09,232 --> 01:01:14,067
No, Dempsey ain't no dry diver.
Guys like that always end up on their feet.

640
01:01:16,539 --> 01:01:18,336
Figuratively speaking.

641
01:01:45,768 --> 01:01:48,066
Jerry, got a minute?

642
01:01:49,005 --> 01:01:51,906
- I'll come back.
- No, come on in.

643
01:01:54,811 --> 01:01:56,244
So, what's up?

644
01:02:01,617 --> 01:02:03,812
Alan, are you taking your medication?

645
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:06,218
That's the most baroque tale I ever heard.

646
01:02:06,289 --> 01:02:10,248
- I know it sounds a little complex.
- A little? Come on, Jerry.

647
01:02:10,526 --> 01:02:13,393
- I know it's...
- What about motive?

648
01:02:13,629 --> 01:02:16,689
- They were doing each other.
- Dempsey didn't know that.

649
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:20,001
What if he did?

650
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:25,870
I personally am not calling him in.

651
01:02:36,986 --> 01:02:39,784
Demps. You back?

652
01:02:39,856 --> 01:02:42,654
In a manner of speaking. I'm a murder suspect.

653
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:45,921
And you're one guilty motherfucker, too.

654
01:02:47,964 --> 01:02:51,195
- Just give me a holler when you're ready.
- Okay. Thanks.

655
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:02,444
Let's make this quick.

656
01:03:03,412 --> 01:03:06,210
Dempsey, there seems to be some confusion.

657
01:03:06,849 --> 01:03:10,046
- Alan, why don't you...
- Are you confused, Alan?

658
01:03:11,754 --> 01:03:16,157
Yeah, we got a little problem
with the angle of the dangle.

659
01:03:17,593 --> 01:03:20,391
Your brother's entry wounds,
they just don't make sense...

660
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:23,159
...being fired from a sitting position.

661
01:03:24,167 --> 01:03:26,635
I don't understand how that could happen.

662
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:41,509
Well, I'll tell you what.
I heard a noise, and I came...

663
01:03:41,751 --> 01:03:44,914
...jogging into the bedroom
and saw my brother and...

664
01:03:45,321 --> 01:03:47,619
We're sorry to bring you in like this.

665
01:03:50,059 --> 01:03:51,583
He was crouched down.

666
01:03:52,795 --> 01:03:54,092
Why?

667
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:56,560
I threw something at him.

668
01:03:57,466 --> 01:04:00,924
- Why didn't you mention that before?
- I just remembered it.

669
01:04:01,604 --> 01:04:03,970
I know, it sounds like a big clichè.

670
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:06,502
I just remembered it.

671
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:11,670
Do you remember what you threw?

672
01:04:15,051 --> 01:04:18,111
- Paperweight.
- What did it look like?

673
01:04:18,821 --> 01:04:22,450
Palm tree with snow. Got it in Hawaii.

674
01:04:34,737 --> 01:04:35,795
Fine.

675
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:10,163
The plot thickens.

676
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:16,442
Directory assistance. What city, please?

677
01:05:16,512 --> 01:05:20,676
Information for Oahu,
it's a business in Honolulu.

678
01:05:24,854 --> 01:05:26,287
That's great.

679
01:05:27,390 --> 01:05:29,790
Good. That's good, come on.

680
01:05:31,394 --> 01:05:33,123
Have a nice vacation.

681
01:05:36,032 --> 01:05:37,021
Hi.

682
01:05:38,167 --> 01:05:40,465
I was wondering if you could help me.

683
01:06:17,606 --> 01:06:19,233
I'll be right with you.

684
01:06:20,476 --> 01:06:22,034
Take your time.

685
01:06:27,416 --> 01:06:29,714
This is yours. Get your bun.

686
01:06:29,785 --> 01:06:32,754
This is yours. Nice. Very good.

687
01:06:33,189 --> 01:06:34,281
What?

688
01:06:37,259 --> 01:06:39,056
You got me.

689
01:06:49,071 --> 01:06:51,039
Go!

690
01:06:52,141 --> 01:06:54,541
Slippery Sam wins by a neck.

691
01:06:54,610 --> 01:06:57,579
Ain't right that he got a bug up his ass
about the shooting.

692
01:06:57,646 --> 01:07:00,137
- What kind of bug?
- He's not giving up on it.

693
01:07:00,316 --> 01:07:03,149
On his off hours digging away,
spent a couple days in Mexico.

694
01:07:03,219 --> 01:07:05,449
Son of a bitch. What's with this guy?

695
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:09,321
- Did Captain give him a nod on this?
- No. He thinks he's being secretive.

696
01:07:09,392 --> 01:07:11,690
Captain's not even willing to talk about it.

697
01:07:11,761 --> 01:07:15,197
- That petty, fucking, vindictive...
- Ricky, forget it.

698
01:07:15,331 --> 01:07:17,424
- The guy's got no life.
- Alan.

699
01:07:18,601 --> 01:07:21,968
Explain to me this Dempsey-fixation
thing you got here.

700
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:25,633
Independents from the 15th come down
and say we got no problem here.

701
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:27,676
- Get me another beer.
- You say no...

702
01:07:27,743 --> 01:07:30,405
...going behind everyone's back to the IA,
who says:

703
01:07:30,479 --> 01:07:33,744
"We got no problem." Captain, "No problem."

704
01:07:34,083 --> 01:07:37,109
So my question,
"What's your fucking problem?"

705
01:07:37,753 --> 01:07:41,917
There's a lot of us who are confused,
not just me. Who are you working for?

706
01:07:43,793 --> 01:07:48,127
Why don't you back off, Enrique?
You're invading my space...

707
01:07:48,397 --> 01:07:51,594
...and your taco breath is a little appalling.

708
01:07:52,168 --> 01:07:54,602
I'm gonna rip your motherfucking head.

709
01:07:54,937 --> 01:07:57,667
Fuck you, you rat, you mole, you piece of shit.

710
01:07:58,674 --> 01:08:00,005
All right.

711
01:08:01,277 --> 01:08:05,213
How can I help you? What can I do for you?
You wanna come to my house?

712
01:08:05,281 --> 01:08:08,739
You wanna go through my files?
You wanna put me on the box?

713
01:08:11,287 --> 01:08:13,118
That's a fine idea, Dempsey.

714
01:08:14,223 --> 01:08:15,781
Thanks for the offer.

715
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:25,923
Give me another beer.

716
01:08:28,671 --> 01:08:30,468
Is your first name Dempsey?

717
01:08:31,874 --> 01:08:33,136
Yes.

718
01:08:37,213 --> 01:08:38,840
Do you live in England?

719
01:08:39,849 --> 01:08:40,941
No.

720
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:44,514
Do you have two children?

721
01:08:46,922 --> 01:08:48,184
Yes.

722
01:08:57,099 --> 01:08:58,828
Do you have two children?

723
01:09:03,906 --> 01:09:05,168
Yes.

724
01:09:14,884 --> 01:09:16,613
Do you have two children?

725
01:09:29,265 --> 01:09:30,254
Yes.

726
01:09:46,515 --> 01:09:48,244
Will you just drop it?

727
01:09:48,551 --> 01:09:49,848
This is getting sick.

728
01:09:49,919 --> 01:09:53,082
- I can't.
- Why? He passed. What do you want?

729
01:09:53,489 --> 01:09:56,219
People are talking about you. This is ugly.

730
01:09:56,292 --> 01:09:58,283
- You weren't there.
- Where?

731
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:01,090
When we brought him in for questioning,
he was dancing...

732
01:10:01,163 --> 01:10:05,122
...doing fucking triple axels.
I know this guy. He's dirty.

733
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:07,601
How do you know? You got nothing on him.

734
01:10:07,770 --> 01:10:11,206
How do I know?
I'm a highly-trained professional.

735
01:10:11,307 --> 01:10:13,207
That's how I know.

736
01:10:13,275 --> 01:10:16,210
Nick might have been stupid,
but he wasn't a killer.

737
01:10:17,613 --> 01:10:19,410
I'll tell you one thing...

738
01:10:19,481 --> 01:10:23,144
...if my brother was banging my wife,
I'd shoot him, too.

739
01:10:30,726 --> 01:10:31,715
No.

740
01:10:31,794 --> 01:10:34,558
Don't give me this,
"No disrespect intended," bullshit.

741
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:38,225
You're investigating one of my men,
my best man, behind my back.

742
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:42,430
- Look, I'm saying the paperweight...
- Fuck the paperweight.

743
01:10:42,771 --> 01:10:44,636
You don't have the shred of a case.

744
01:10:44,707 --> 01:10:47,540
You going to take this paperweight
bullshit to the D. A?

745
01:10:47,610 --> 01:10:50,135
I'll tell you what this looks like.

746
01:10:50,346 --> 01:10:54,476
This is a personal vendetta,
and I will not stand for it.

747
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:57,545
You hear me? Now drop it.

748
01:10:59,555 --> 01:11:01,750
I don't wanna hear about this again.

749
01:11:02,925 --> 01:11:04,085
- All right.
- Okay?

750
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:08,118
- I said, "All right."
- All right. I want you to work on this.

751
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:14,030
Surveillance? You're punishing me with a sit?

752
01:11:14,436 --> 01:11:16,301
You call it what you want.

753
01:11:24,713 --> 01:11:27,238
I think he's been through enough, don't you?

754
01:11:33,555 --> 01:11:35,887
- Da, can you get that?
- I got it.

755
01:11:42,431 --> 01:11:44,865
You're not delivering
Chinese food now, are you?

756
01:11:44,933 --> 01:11:48,232
- No. Hi, Damon.
- Hi.

757
01:11:51,707 --> 01:11:54,471
I just wanted to apologize for the...

758
01:11:55,277 --> 01:11:56,801
Well, if I was...

759
01:11:57,780 --> 01:11:59,475
The bar the other night.

760
01:11:59,682 --> 01:12:03,413
- I brought you this. I just wanted to say...
- Come on in.

761
01:12:03,686 --> 01:12:05,813
Just ask me what you want to know.

762
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:20,166
You said Nick
was crouching when you shot him.

763
01:12:20,369 --> 01:12:23,361
That's why the entry wounds look like they did.

764
01:12:23,639 --> 01:12:26,437
And you said he was crouching because...

765
01:12:26,508 --> 01:12:29,341
...you threw a paperweight at him.
- That's right.

766
01:12:32,081 --> 01:12:33,571
Then how come...

767
01:12:34,583 --> 01:12:36,107
...the paperweight...

768
01:12:37,319 --> 01:12:39,184
...is sitting on the shelf?

769
01:12:42,157 --> 01:12:44,751
Here's a blowup, if you want a better look.

770
01:12:54,169 --> 01:12:57,036
And there she still sits.

771
01:13:07,783 --> 01:13:11,241
I didn't throw that paperweight, Alan. I threw...

772
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:13,385
...that one.

773
01:13:20,829 --> 01:13:23,024
- It's the same.
- Yeah.

774
01:13:24,867 --> 01:13:27,199
You have two identical paperweights.

775
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:31,134
While Gail and I were on our honeymoon,
we brought one back for Nick...

776
01:13:31,206 --> 01:13:32,867
...and he never took his home.

777
01:13:32,941 --> 01:13:35,774
- It's not in the photos.
- Yes, it is.

778
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:40,010
- Where?
- It's right there, under the couch.

779
01:13:41,316 --> 01:13:44,843
You did take photos under the couch,
didn't you?

780
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:02,063
Will you stop it? I'm off it, okay.
Maybe I got a little nuts.

781
01:14:02,337 --> 01:14:04,066
You got a lot nuts, pal.

782
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:09,210
Is that her?

783
01:14:12,948 --> 01:14:14,540
It's not her.

784
01:14:15,984 --> 01:14:17,713
You going to eat that pie?

785
01:14:27,329 --> 01:14:31,425
- Rough night? You boys been naughty.
- Fuck you.

786
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:33,565
You don't have to babysit me.

787
01:14:35,270 --> 01:14:36,999
What you got?

788
01:14:37,206 --> 01:14:39,538
I want to log back into Cain shooting.

789
01:14:39,608 --> 01:14:41,667
Thing is you're obsessive.

790
01:14:41,977 --> 01:14:44,411
Four pieces. Sign the log, please.

791
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:47,415
Phyllis always said this about you,
and she was right.

792
01:14:47,783 --> 01:14:49,944
- How is Phyllis?
- I need your badge number.

793
01:14:50,018 --> 01:14:52,486
I heard she's moving to Ohio with some dentist.

794
01:14:52,554 --> 01:14:54,886
Heard she looks great, really happy.

795
01:14:56,758 --> 01:14:58,157
No wonder she left you.

796
01:14:58,227 --> 01:15:01,355
You got this obsessive-compulsive
personality thing.

797
01:15:01,530 --> 01:15:04,590
The good news is, you can get help.

798
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:07,225
There's people you can talk to.

799
01:15:09,104 --> 01:15:10,628
He's killing me.

800
01:15:13,408 --> 01:15:14,932
I'm spinning out.

801
01:15:18,146 --> 01:15:21,206
Hello, Jimmy? Alan. How's it going?

802
01:15:21,617 --> 01:15:23,084
Great. Listen...

803
01:15:23,151 --> 01:15:26,177
...do you remember that Mexican
counterfeiting operation?

804
01:15:26,255 --> 01:15:29,554
They were doing everything.
50s, passports, green cards.

805
01:15:30,158 --> 01:15:33,252
Yeah. Big fat guy.

806
01:15:33,328 --> 01:15:35,626
Dempsey's case. No.

807
01:15:36,465 --> 01:15:38,330
What year was that?

808
01:15:47,175 --> 01:15:48,802
Night, Alan.

809
01:15:48,877 --> 01:15:50,504
Goodnight.

810
01:16:12,267 --> 01:16:13,757
Fuck it.

811
01:16:26,982 --> 01:16:28,347
Chronicle.

812
01:16:32,988 --> 01:16:35,183
I didn't call the papers, all right?

813
01:16:35,490 --> 01:16:37,424
Fuck you, man.

814
01:16:38,427 --> 01:16:42,488
Who else would know this shit?
It's got your name all fucking over it.

815
01:16:42,864 --> 01:16:46,265
- Somebody talk to me here.
- What if we let it blow over?

816
01:16:46,335 --> 01:16:48,064
For Christ's sake.

817
01:16:48,303 --> 01:16:51,795
There is no way IA can avoid
an investigation at this point.

818
01:16:51,873 --> 01:16:53,898
I'm not dragging a good cop to court...

819
01:16:53,976 --> 01:16:57,343
...just to satisfy the press
and some idiot politician.

820
01:16:59,314 --> 01:17:02,112
There's nothing hard here.
It's all circumstantial.

821
01:17:02,517 --> 01:17:03,916
I'll get you more.

822
01:17:05,454 --> 01:17:08,753
Now, if this guy is dirty,
we've got to file charges.

823
01:17:08,824 --> 01:17:10,951
I know your job description, Bob.

824
01:17:13,128 --> 01:17:17,588
We do the preliminary hearing. We keep it
as quiet as we can. See if it survives.

825
01:17:26,908 --> 01:17:30,241
Okay, Detective, you do your worst.

826
01:17:30,746 --> 01:17:34,842
But if you are wrong, I will have you for lunch.

827
01:17:35,550 --> 01:17:36,949
Are you with me?

828
01:17:46,395 --> 01:17:47,726
See you, Dad.

829
01:17:48,764 --> 01:17:52,393
- Gotta go to practice, be home late.
- Okay. See you later.

830
01:18:24,633 --> 01:18:27,932
This is the time and place
of the preliminary hearing...

831
01:18:28,236 --> 01:18:31,535
...in the matter of the State of California versus...

832
01:18:32,140 --> 01:18:33,630
...Dempsey Cain.

833
01:18:34,109 --> 01:18:38,170
How would you describe the relationship
between Cain and your daughter?

834
01:18:38,747 --> 01:18:41,238
Well, from the outside, it looked perfect.

835
01:18:42,117 --> 01:18:43,914
- But I think...
- In your opinion...

836
01:18:43,985 --> 01:18:47,182
...would a $1-million insurance policy
in her name...

837
01:18:47,255 --> 01:18:49,883
Objection. Calls for speculation.

838
01:18:49,991 --> 01:18:51,322
Sustained.

839
01:18:52,027 --> 01:18:55,793
Could you repeat, to the best of your ability,
exactly what she said?

840
01:18:56,732 --> 01:19:01,692
She said, "I'm 35, and I don't want to
push a wheelchair for the rest of my life."

841
01:19:02,003 --> 01:19:04,471
Thank you. No further questions.

842
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:09,506
Then he took the gun out of his mouth
and broke down in tears.

843
01:19:10,212 --> 01:19:13,204
- And the window shades were open.
- Yes.

844
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:16,884
If you were really going to commit suicide...

845
01:19:16,985 --> 01:19:19,044
...would you sit in front of a window?

846
01:19:19,121 --> 01:19:22,454
Objection. The prosecutor's testifying.
Argumentative.

847
01:19:22,524 --> 01:19:23,548
Sustained.

848
01:19:23,625 --> 01:19:25,820
The California distinguished service award...

849
01:19:25,894 --> 01:19:28,260
...and Mayor's commendation for public service.

850
01:19:28,330 --> 01:19:31,026
And prior to becoming
a decorated police officer?

851
01:19:31,099 --> 01:19:34,535
He was a U.S. Navy test pilot,
discharged with honors.

852
01:19:34,736 --> 01:19:37,864
I believe his eyesight fell
just below pilot standards.

853
01:19:38,607 --> 01:19:40,507
A typical murderer's resume.

854
01:19:40,575 --> 01:19:43,100
Come on. Objection, your honor.

855
01:19:43,178 --> 01:19:46,045
Sustained. Ms. Wallace,
you have no jury to play to here.

856
01:19:46,114 --> 01:19:50,448
I can assure you, your sarcasm,
however clever, is being wasted on me.

857
01:19:50,786 --> 01:19:52,583
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

858
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:56,417
Could you describe him for us?

859
01:19:56,491 --> 01:19:59,085
Yes. He was a big guy, over 6 feet...

860
01:19:59,161 --> 01:20:02,028
...had a beard, wore a cap, like a watch cap.

861
01:20:02,364 --> 01:20:04,924
Longish hair, and he walked with a cane.

862
01:20:05,267 --> 01:20:07,258
He walked with a cane.

863
01:20:08,637 --> 01:20:11,197
- Go on, please.
- He picked up a few videos.

864
01:20:11,306 --> 01:20:15,003
Mr. Morphus, do you see the man
who rented those videos in the courtroom?

865
01:20:16,077 --> 01:20:17,101
No.

866
01:20:17,179 --> 01:20:20,945
Is this the man who rented those videos
from your store on July 11?

867
01:20:22,284 --> 01:20:23,512
Yeah.

868
01:20:23,785 --> 01:20:26,015
Yeah. That's the guy.

869
01:20:26,388 --> 01:20:30,381
Your Honor, I'm holding the photograph
of a man. I'm marking this People's 9.

870
01:20:30,458 --> 01:20:33,427
It is a picture of Detective Cain,
altered by computer...

871
01:20:33,495 --> 01:20:36,896
...adding a cap, glasses,
a beard, and lengthened hair.

872
01:20:38,066 --> 01:20:40,330
- Your witness.
- May I?

873
01:20:42,537 --> 01:20:45,335
This is the man you think
rented those videos from you.

874
01:20:45,407 --> 01:20:47,534
Yeah. That's what he looked like.

875
01:20:50,345 --> 01:20:53,542
And you are sure this is the man?

876
01:20:55,750 --> 01:20:57,342
That's the guy.

877
01:20:58,787 --> 01:21:01,187
You Honor, I'm holding a photograph of a man...

878
01:21:01,256 --> 01:21:03,520
...l'm marking it defense Exhibit "C."

879
01:21:03,625 --> 01:21:07,959
It's a computer-altered photograph
of Charles McKenzie, a man on my staff.

880
01:21:09,097 --> 01:21:14,000
You've just identified two different men
as the man who rented those videos.

881
01:21:15,237 --> 01:21:17,228
Which is it?

882
01:21:21,509 --> 01:21:24,672
And what are the chances
of a patient with this condition...

883
01:21:24,746 --> 01:21:26,714
...becoming ambulatory again?

884
01:21:27,382 --> 01:21:29,543
50-50 maybe. It's extremely variable.

885
01:21:29,618 --> 01:21:33,179
Could you tell, Doctor,
if a man were faking paralysis?

886
01:21:33,655 --> 01:21:36,954
One could test the patient
for motor and sensory responses.

887
01:21:37,025 --> 01:21:40,153
Yes or no, could you tell,
simply from an examination...

888
01:21:40,228 --> 01:21:42,526
...if a patient were faking paralysis?

889
01:21:43,331 --> 01:21:45,299
You're asking a complicated question.

890
01:21:45,367 --> 01:21:48,359
Yes or no, could someone fake paralysis?

891
01:21:50,038 --> 01:21:51,801
- Yes.
- Thank you.

892
01:21:53,008 --> 01:21:54,407
Your witness.

893
01:21:57,712 --> 01:22:01,011
Dr. Cole, when was the last time
you examined Mr. Cain?

894
01:22:01,883 --> 01:22:02,907
Six weeks ago.

895
01:22:02,984 --> 01:22:07,318
In your professional opinion,
is Detective Cain faking paralysis?

896
01:22:10,725 --> 01:22:12,716
- No.
- Thank you.

897
01:22:16,164 --> 01:22:17,995
The People call...

898
01:22:18,099 --> 01:22:21,068
...Mr. Jorge De La Paz to the stand.

899
01:22:28,310 --> 01:22:30,574
Wait a second, Your Honor. We object.

900
01:22:30,879 --> 01:22:33,279
I had no prior notice of this witness...

901
01:22:33,348 --> 01:22:36,078
...and I move that his testimony not be allowed.

902
01:22:36,384 --> 01:22:39,717
Mr. Shultz, I don't appreciate
your surprises in my courtroom.

903
01:22:39,888 --> 01:22:43,585
I will overrule the defense's objection,
but I will permit a recess.

904
01:22:48,797 --> 01:22:50,924
Who the hell is this guy, Demps?

905
01:22:57,973 --> 01:23:01,136
Okay. Listen to me very carefully.

906
01:23:01,776 --> 01:23:05,303
- Where is your shop located?
- Tijuana, Mexico.

907
01:23:05,613 --> 01:23:09,982
Did you, on July 11, produce this
counterfeit California driver's license...

908
01:23:10,051 --> 01:23:12,417
...for the man pictured in the license?

909
01:23:13,221 --> 01:23:14,518
Yes.

910
01:23:14,789 --> 01:23:19,385
Let the record reflect that Mr. De La Paz
has identified Nick Cain.

911
01:23:19,627 --> 01:23:23,256
Were you expecting Nick Cain
when he arrived at your shop on July 11?

912
01:23:23,331 --> 01:23:25,799
- Yes.
- Had Nick Cain called you?

913
01:23:25,967 --> 01:23:28,333
- No.
- Who did call you?

914
01:23:29,337 --> 01:23:31,032
Dempsey Cain.

915
01:23:33,241 --> 01:23:34,674
Thank you.

916
01:23:35,543 --> 01:23:36,976
Your witness.

917
01:23:37,045 --> 01:23:41,414
Mr. De La Paz, you stated that Mr. Cain
spoke with you on the phone.

918
01:23:41,616 --> 01:23:43,709
- Did he identify himself?
- No.

919
01:23:44,052 --> 01:23:47,818
- Then how did you know it was him?
- Nick Cain came to my shop.

920
01:23:48,289 --> 01:23:50,416
He said Dempsey sent him.

921
01:23:50,692 --> 01:23:54,651
Then I remember his voice on the phone
because we go back.

922
01:23:55,330 --> 01:23:58,026
You go back to 1988...

923
01:23:58,099 --> 01:24:00,727
...when Detective Cain arrested you
for counterfeiting...

924
01:24:00,802 --> 01:24:05,705
...for which you were convicted and spent
three years in the Chino prison, true?

925
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:07,739
Yes, so?

926
01:24:09,677 --> 01:24:12,874
I have no further questions for this witness.

927
01:24:17,852 --> 01:24:21,686
Would you describe your relationship
with Detective Cain as competitive?

928
01:24:21,823 --> 01:24:25,054
I'd say we're all a little competitive
with each other.

929
01:24:25,126 --> 01:24:26,889
It keeps us on our toes.

930
01:24:27,095 --> 01:24:28,653
Do you remember saying:

931
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:32,325
"The Captain has such a hard on
for Dempsey, it's embarrassing"?

932
01:24:34,502 --> 01:24:36,265
Probably. I might have.

933
01:24:36,337 --> 01:24:41,070
Tell me, Detective, were you initially
assigned to the Cain case to investigate?

934
01:24:41,443 --> 01:24:42,501
No.

935
01:24:42,577 --> 01:24:45,239
Did the Captain authorize you to investigate?

936
01:24:45,747 --> 01:24:46,577
No.

937
01:24:46,648 --> 01:24:49,549
Yet you found yourself in
Tijuana, Mexico, investigating.

938
01:24:49,617 --> 01:24:51,881
Yes. I was down there on other business...

939
01:24:51,953 --> 01:24:54,786
Did you arrange for Mr. De La Paz's
trip here today?

940
01:24:55,323 --> 01:24:56,312
Yes.

941
01:24:56,391 --> 01:25:01,522
Isn't it true that Mr. De La Paz is receiving
$75 a day to testify?

942
01:25:01,629 --> 01:25:04,792
- That is standard procedure.
- Objection! Mr. De La Paz...

943
01:25:04,866 --> 01:25:08,393
...is being reimbursed for
legitimate expenses and lost wages.

944
01:25:08,470 --> 01:25:09,402
Sustained.

945
01:25:09,471 --> 01:25:12,372
Is it not also standard procedure
that the detectives...

946
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:15,637
...augment these legitimate expenses
under the table?

947
01:25:15,710 --> 01:25:18,338
Your Honor,
we strongly resent these insinuations.

948
01:25:18,413 --> 01:25:21,109
Are you suggesting I bought this witness?

949
01:25:21,249 --> 01:25:25,276
Your Honor, I'm suggesting that he has
a personal vendetta against my client.

950
01:25:25,353 --> 01:25:26,479
Come on!

951
01:25:26,554 --> 01:25:30,456
It's clear that Mr. De La Paz will sell
anything to anybody at the right price.

952
01:25:30,525 --> 01:25:32,288
These are unfounded allegations.

953
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:34,920
This court will come to order.

954
01:25:38,199 --> 01:25:39,564
Mr. Cain...

955
01:25:39,634 --> 01:25:42,865
...did you contact Mr. De La Paz
by phone or in any other manner...

956
01:25:42,937 --> 01:25:46,168
...between May 1 and July 11 of this year?

957
01:25:47,609 --> 01:25:49,543
No, I absolutely did not.

958
01:25:50,278 --> 01:25:55,272
Mr. Cain, on the night of July 15,
did you shoot your wife and brother?

959
01:25:57,018 --> 01:25:58,007
Yes.

960
01:25:58,386 --> 01:26:00,616
Could you repeat that, please? Louder.

961
01:26:04,492 --> 01:26:06,960
- Yes, I did.
- Why?

962
01:26:09,197 --> 01:26:11,358
Because they were going to kill me.

963
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:14,764
Do you have any feeling in your legs?

964
01:26:16,337 --> 01:26:18,805
- No.
- Are you able to walk?

965
01:26:22,544 --> 01:26:23,772
No.

966
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:27,113
Thank you.

967
01:26:27,682 --> 01:26:29,809
The defense rests, Your Honor.

968
01:26:58,413 --> 01:27:01,780
It appearing to me,
from the evidence presented in this case...

969
01:27:02,417 --> 01:27:04,885
...that the court does not find
sufficient evidence...

970
01:27:04,953 --> 01:27:09,014
...to hold the defendant to answer to
the charges of murder in the first degree.

971
01:27:10,124 --> 01:27:13,059
The case is dismissed.
The defendant is discharged.

972
01:27:31,512 --> 01:27:34,948
Son of a bitch murdered
his wife and his brother, and now he...

973
01:27:35,717 --> 01:27:37,582
...walks away.

974
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:41,211
I'm sorry you had to go through this, pal.

975
01:27:48,496 --> 01:27:50,020
Congratulations.

976
01:27:50,865 --> 01:27:52,093
Again.

977
01:27:59,807 --> 01:28:02,207
But I got to tell you something, Demps...

978
01:28:05,713 --> 01:28:08,079
...l'm a better detective than you are.

979
01:28:10,018 --> 01:28:11,645
'Cause I got the nose.

980
01:28:13,021 --> 01:28:15,114
I know you murdered them.

981
01:28:19,927 --> 01:28:21,554
And I know...

982
01:28:22,830 --> 01:28:24,957
I know you can walk.

983
01:28:30,872 --> 01:28:33,966
- Oh, my God.
- Jesus, Alan. What the hell?

984
01:28:34,042 --> 01:28:36,670
Get him out of here. Get this guy out of here.

985
01:28:43,618 --> 01:28:45,483
You have the right to remain silent.

986
01:28:45,553 --> 01:28:49,250
If you waive it, anything you say
will be held against you in a court of law.

987
01:28:49,324 --> 01:28:50,848
You have the right to an attorney.

988
01:28:50,925 --> 01:28:55,123
If you cannot afford one, one will be
appointed for you before you're questioned.

989
01:29:04,205 --> 01:29:06,105
What the hell is going on?

990
01:29:09,510 --> 01:29:11,569
I'll need you to sign here.

991
01:29:23,324 --> 01:29:24,985
We're okay. All right.

992
01:29:25,660 --> 01:29:27,992
Hey there, sunshine.

993
01:29:28,429 --> 01:29:30,192
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

994
01:29:30,665 --> 01:29:32,132
What happened to your leg?

995
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:34,862
I was in a little accident. It's okay, though.

996
01:31:09,897 --> 01:31:12,889
- She's not very good.
- No, she's not.

997
01:31:16,003 --> 01:31:17,630
But I like her.

998
01:31:31,686 --> 01:31:33,586
What am I doing wrong?

999
01:31:35,289 --> 01:31:38,315
You've got to learn
how to control your concentration.
