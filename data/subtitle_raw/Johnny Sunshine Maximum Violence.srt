(static buzzing)

3
00:00:12,003 --> 00:00:15,253
(jazzy dramatic music)

4
00:00:50,883 --> 00:00:54,302
♫ You are my sunshine

5
00:00:54,302 --> 00:00:58,243
♫ My only sun, my only sun

6
00:00:58,243 --> 00:01:01,243
♫ You make me happy

7
00:01:02,139 --> 00:01:06,323
♫ When skies are grey, when skies are grey

8
00:01:06,323 --> 00:01:09,740
♫ You'll never know dear

9
00:01:10,773 --> 00:01:14,841
♫ How much I love, how much I love

10
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:19,008
♫ Please don't take my sunshine away

11
00:01:24,944 --> 00:01:28,486
♫ You are my sunshine

12
00:01:28,486 --> 00:01:32,225
♫ My only sunshine

13
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:35,225
♫ You make me happy

14
00:01:36,065 --> 00:01:39,232
♫ When skies are grey

♫ Please don't take my sunshine away

18
00:01:54,886 --> 00:01:59,053
♫ You are my sunshine, my only sunshine

19
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:05,022
♫ You make me happy

20
00:02:06,065 --> 00:02:09,232
♫ When skies are grey

21
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,262
♫ You'll never know, dear

22
00:02:14,262 --> 00:02:17,429
♫ How much I love you

23
00:02:18,844 --> 00:02:23,011
♫ Please don't take my sunshine away

(dramatic rock music)

25
00:04:04,113 --> 00:04:07,530
("Star Spangled Banner")

26
00:04:14,273 --> 00:04:16,832
Hello, and good morning
to you, ladies and gentlemen

27
00:04:16,832 --> 00:04:19,632
of the City Admissions
and Citizenship Council.

28
00:04:19,632 --> 00:04:21,292
I'd like to extend a special greeting

29
00:04:21,292 --> 00:04:23,313
to Councilman Harrington who supports me

30
00:04:23,313 --> 00:04:26,563
fully and is my sponsor in this matter.

31
00:04:27,414 --> 00:04:29,493
The presentation and review materials

32
00:04:29,493 --> 00:04:30,490
(ominous organ music)

33
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,193
that you find included in your package

34
00:04:32,193 --> 00:04:35,612
are to establish the legitimacy
of my bid for citizenship

35
00:04:35,612 --> 00:04:37,916
in the fortified city proper.

36
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:40,291
With me I bring the
requisite citizenship fee

37
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:43,873
paid for five years in
advance and a profitable

38
00:04:43,873 --> 00:04:47,174
and equitable business,
Maximum Productions.

39
00:04:47,174 --> 00:04:49,558
Now I know that many of you are familiar

40
00:04:49,558 --> 00:04:51,534
with the types of film that I produce

41
00:04:51,534 --> 00:04:54,859
or you may have heard
he just peddles in smut,

42
00:04:54,859 --> 00:04:57,415
et cetera, et cetera.

43
00:04:57,415 --> 00:05:00,731
I would argue however that
with advent of the Rising,

44
00:05:00,731 --> 00:05:04,898
profits must be realized
in infinitely diverse ways.

45
00:05:06,492 --> 00:05:09,909
(dramatic ambient music)

46
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,610
(camera humming)

47
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:22,923
Fuck.

48
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:26,090
(dramatic rock music)

49
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,657
[Johnny] Poor guy, he owes.

50
00:05:43,061 --> 00:05:46,299
Like so many of us out here in The Sprawl.

51
00:05:46,299 --> 00:05:47,632
But he owes Max.

52
00:05:49,117 --> 00:05:51,341
In The Sprawl, you don't get a tombstone,

53
00:05:51,341 --> 00:05:55,077
you don't get a eulogy, you
just hope to die on film.

54
00:05:55,077 --> 00:05:58,244
(dramatic rock music)

55
00:06:09,027 --> 00:06:11,027
This isn't an execution.

56
00:06:13,544 --> 00:06:14,602
It's entertainment.

57
00:06:14,602 --> 00:06:18,149
(dramatic rock music)

58
00:06:18,149 --> 00:06:20,899
I'm Johnny Sunshine, I'm a titan.

59
00:06:23,587 --> 00:06:24,920
I'm a hurricane.

60
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:29,864
The soft whisper of a razor blade on skin.

61
00:06:29,864 --> 00:06:34,031
I use many tools to entertain
and this one, not bad.

62
00:06:36,002 --> 00:06:39,144
If I slide my blade above his floating rib

63
00:06:39,144 --> 00:06:41,861
and tease the lung just a little

64
00:06:41,861 --> 00:06:44,106
(coughing)

65
00:06:44,106 --> 00:06:47,226
(heavy breathing)

66
00:06:47,226 --> 00:06:48,559
it erupts on me.

67
00:06:49,605 --> 00:06:52,688
The blood that cools against my skin.

68
00:06:55,306 --> 00:06:56,139
Gently now.

69
00:06:56,139 --> 00:06:57,861
(coughing)

70
00:06:57,861 --> 00:07:00,694
(heavy breathing)

71
00:07:03,306 --> 00:07:06,146
No tombstone for this one.

72
00:07:06,146 --> 00:07:08,325
But he's a narc, he owes Max,

73
00:07:08,325 --> 00:07:11,158
and the cameras are always hungry.

74
00:07:12,581 --> 00:07:15,748
(dramatic rock music)

75
00:07:20,838 --> 00:07:23,921
(door creaking open)

76
00:07:25,156 --> 00:07:27,823
(ominous music)

77
00:07:47,922 --> 00:07:51,005
(door creaking shut)

78
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:02,413
(ominous music)

79
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:47,327
This is what really sells, the kill fuck.

80
00:08:48,634 --> 00:08:52,734
I don't know who he is,
and I really don't care.

81
00:08:52,734 --> 00:08:55,734
So long as the money comes, he goes.

82
00:08:57,135 --> 00:09:00,335
Don't worry, I'll make the most of him.

83
00:09:00,335 --> 00:09:03,002
(ominous music)

84
00:09:19,877 --> 00:09:23,044
(gentle guitar music)

85
00:09:26,764 --> 00:09:29,875
I keep a cocktail under the armrest,

86
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:34,042
my own blend of ecstasy, Sodium
Pentothal, and Belladonna.

87
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:40,029
Keeps the mind subdued
but the flesh willing.

88
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:45,123
[Man] Fuck.

89
00:09:45,123 --> 00:09:48,290
(yelling and gagging)

90
00:09:55,006 --> 00:09:56,839
[Johnny] Disgusting.

91
00:09:57,999 --> 00:10:00,307
What are you doing?

92
00:10:00,307 --> 00:10:03,208
You crazy fucking bitch,
what are you doing?

93
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:04,684
[Johnny] Let's see.

94
00:10:04,684 --> 00:10:05,517
The fuck!

95
00:10:05,517 --> 00:10:06,670
[Johnny] Ah.

96
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,003
Fuck you, hey!

97
00:10:09,838 --> 00:10:11,886
I'm talking to you!

98
00:10:11,886 --> 00:10:14,636
- Let's see.
- Fucking talk to me!

99
00:10:15,523 --> 00:10:18,867
[Johnny] Hmm, I remember that one.

100
00:10:18,867 --> 00:10:21,938
I'll kill you, oh my God,
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

101
00:10:21,938 --> 00:10:25,938
(gentle guitar and vocal music)

102
00:10:30,204 --> 00:10:34,371
[Johnny] Oh yeah, one in the
pink, and one in the stink.

103
00:10:36,638 --> 00:10:38,462
Mm-hmm.
What are you doing?

104
00:10:38,462 --> 00:10:42,462
(gentle guitar and vocal music)

105
00:10:46,256 --> 00:10:49,102
You crazy fucking cunt,
what the fuck do you want?

106
00:10:49,102 --> 00:10:50,019
Talk to me!

107
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:52,946
[Johnny] Oh.

108
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,333
Zap to the clit.

109
00:10:57,463 --> 00:11:00,046
Every girl should try this one.

110
00:11:01,438 --> 00:11:02,271
Favorite.

111
00:11:09,603 --> 00:11:11,270
Ooh, this one hurts.

112
00:11:14,082 --> 00:11:15,415
So many devices.

113
00:11:16,883 --> 00:11:20,883
(gentle guitar and vocal music)

114
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:36,302
[Man] Hey fucking talk to me,
what the fuck are you doing?

115
00:11:36,302 --> 00:11:40,469
[Johnny] I enjoy the
anticipation, the choosing.

116
00:11:41,422 --> 00:11:43,839
The feeling part comes later.

117
00:11:45,102 --> 00:11:49,269
♫ I don't have the words to say I love you

118
00:11:55,203 --> 00:11:59,203
(gentle guitar and vocal music)

119
00:12:05,262 --> 00:12:06,095
Oh shit.

120
00:12:15,566 --> 00:12:17,982
(ominous booming)

121
00:12:17,982 --> 00:12:20,482
(eerie music)

122
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:28,220
I'm gonna make you a star.

123
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,720
(eerie music)

124
00:12:39,014 --> 00:12:40,597
This is what sells.

125
00:12:47,138 --> 00:12:48,305
The kill fuck.

126
00:12:52,956 --> 00:12:55,789
(heavy breathing)

127
00:12:57,913 --> 00:12:59,580
Max needs his money.

128
00:13:01,584 --> 00:13:02,751
And I get off.

129
00:13:07,282 --> 00:13:10,532
This is what sells, this is what sells.

130
00:13:12,774 --> 00:13:15,378
(moaning and heavy breathing)

131
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:18,412
(eerie music)

132
00:13:18,412 --> 00:13:19,995
This is what sells.

133
00:13:23,698 --> 00:13:27,334
I have to have it, I
have to have the blood.

134
00:13:27,334 --> 00:13:29,115
(man yelling)

135
00:13:29,115 --> 00:13:30,226
I have to have it.

136
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,951
(man yelling)

137
00:13:32,951 --> 00:13:35,239
(moaning and yelling)

138
00:13:35,239 --> 00:13:38,406
(yelling and moaning)

139
00:13:45,436 --> 00:13:47,936
(eerie music)

140
00:14:08,596 --> 00:14:10,429
Where are you going?

141
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,339
(man yelling)

142
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:16,422
(panicked breathing)

143
00:14:34,711 --> 00:14:36,887
(gurgling)

144
00:14:36,887 --> 00:14:39,387
(eerie music)

145
00:14:50,394 --> 00:14:52,850
[Johnny] Porn star and killer for hire.

146
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,517
I fuck and I murder.

147
00:14:55,754 --> 00:14:58,730
I am Johnny Sunshine, and this is my life.

148
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:01,397
(ominous music)

149
00:15:24,918 --> 00:15:28,001
Hard music, hard sex, and hard drugs.

150
00:15:29,394 --> 00:15:32,894
The only way we can feel like we're alive.

151
00:15:45,019 --> 00:15:48,436
We're all junkies of one sort or another.

152
00:15:49,597 --> 00:15:51,847
We all have our addictions.

153
00:15:54,502 --> 00:15:58,662
Subdermal injection right
into the bloodstream.

154
00:15:58,662 --> 00:16:01,339
No needles, no pain, no remorse.

155
00:16:01,339 --> 00:16:04,506
(dramatic rock music)

156
00:16:50,633 --> 00:16:54,800
Since the Rising of our
killing, a victim or a zombie.

157
00:16:59,348 --> 00:17:01,293
It all started when I was a little girl.

158
00:17:01,293 --> 00:17:04,210
(eerie rock music)

159
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:10,427
One day the dead just
stopped staying dead.

160
00:17:10,427 --> 00:17:12,260
Zombies were among us.

161
00:17:13,671 --> 00:17:15,911
Why call them anything else?

162
00:17:15,911 --> 00:17:17,988
Corpses that feed on the living.

163
00:17:17,988 --> 00:17:19,709
[Little Girl] Daddy, Daddy.

164
00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:21,748
[Johnny] The world went straight to Hell

165
00:17:21,748 --> 00:17:22,865
(screaming)

166
00:17:22,865 --> 00:17:24,951
[Demon] Come to Daddy!

167
00:17:24,951 --> 00:17:27,284
And stayed there ever since.

168
00:17:28,327 --> 00:17:31,577
(energetic rock music)

169
00:18:37,686 --> 00:18:40,436
(static buzzing)

170
00:18:47,007 --> 00:18:48,340
Why the snuff?

171
00:18:51,211 --> 00:18:53,925
Because it makes me rich,
because of the amazing

172
00:18:53,925 --> 00:18:56,592
defense that only money can buy.

173
00:18:58,723 --> 00:19:02,890
I do what I have to do to
stay on top of the game.

174
00:19:03,866 --> 00:19:07,969
Look, this isn't a fairy
tale, and I'm not the bad guy.

175
00:19:07,969 --> 00:19:10,787
The Rising was the great equalizer, man.

176
00:19:10,787 --> 00:19:14,630
No more wolves and sheep,
all that's left are sheep.

177
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:16,049
(eerie music)

178
00:19:16,049 --> 00:19:18,466
Sick, feral, predatory sheep.

179
00:19:20,411 --> 00:19:22,971
Some breathe, some don't.

180
00:19:22,971 --> 00:19:26,069
I get the ones that do
breathe what they want,

181
00:19:26,069 --> 00:19:29,371
and they want the sickness, the violence.

182
00:19:29,371 --> 00:19:31,670
(static buzzing)

183
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,731
The Rising hasn't just
affected the stiffs out there.

184
00:19:34,731 --> 00:19:38,898
It's affected the living
too, I do what I have to do.

185
00:19:39,771 --> 00:19:42,502
I was born right on time.

186
00:19:42,502 --> 00:19:46,106
(dramatic rock music)

187
00:19:46,106 --> 00:19:48,560
(static buzzing)

188
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,977
(dramatic ambient music)

189
00:19:55,803 --> 00:19:58,553
(camera humming)

190
00:20:04,367 --> 00:20:06,617
(growling)

191
00:20:09,222 --> 00:20:11,472
(growling)

192
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:16,005
(growling)

193
00:20:25,003 --> 00:20:27,702
[Johnny] They are dangerous,
an ever present menace.

194
00:20:27,702 --> 00:20:28,864
(dramatic rock music)

195
00:20:28,864 --> 00:20:32,646
It's always the same,
there are no surprises.

196
00:20:32,646 --> 00:20:36,068
A chance meeting, the familiar dance.

197
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,735
(knife slicing)

198
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:44,438
(groaning)

199
00:20:44,438 --> 00:20:46,605
(yelling)

200
00:20:48,495 --> 00:20:50,745
(growling)

201
00:20:51,798 --> 00:20:52,756
(groaning)

202
00:20:52,756 --> 00:20:54,673
And the inevitable end.

203
00:20:55,668 --> 00:20:58,335
The world gets a little smaller.

204
00:21:02,575 --> 00:21:05,742
(dramatic rock music)

205
00:21:12,652 --> 00:21:14,612
Jeff, is it?

206
00:21:14,612 --> 00:21:19,412
Welcome to the big city Jeff,
and welcome to my movie set.

207
00:21:19,412 --> 00:21:22,772
Lose the clothes, this
isn't Shakespeare, Jeff.

208
00:21:22,772 --> 00:21:25,032
I've got a few ground rules on my set.

209
00:21:25,032 --> 00:21:27,076
I don't care if you have to
smoke it, shoot it, snort it,

210
00:21:27,076 --> 00:21:29,838
use the fluffer or jack it
off, keep your dick hard.

211
00:21:29,838 --> 00:21:31,252
You keep it double wrapped, you don't want

212
00:21:31,252 --> 00:21:35,852
a post-mortem infection
ending your new career.

213
00:21:35,852 --> 00:21:38,815
Alright, what we're doing in this scene,

214
00:21:38,815 --> 00:21:40,993
you're gonna approach
the stiff from behind,

215
00:21:40,993 --> 00:21:44,196
I want you to be aggressive, I
want you to be mean, alright?

216
00:21:44,196 --> 00:21:46,132
You're going to enter her violently.

217
00:21:46,132 --> 00:21:48,072
I want it bloody, I want it mean,

218
00:21:48,072 --> 00:21:50,894
I want it very aggressive,
you hear me, Jeff?

219
00:21:50,894 --> 00:21:51,727
Good.

220
00:21:52,654 --> 00:21:55,535
When you come to the end
of your business, alright,

221
00:21:55,535 --> 00:21:57,295
I want you to grab her
by the back of the hair

222
00:21:57,295 --> 00:22:00,095
and you just bash its
fucking head in, okay?

223
00:22:00,095 --> 00:22:01,455
I want it bloody, I want it messy,

224
00:22:01,455 --> 00:22:03,215
I want brains all over
the wall and all over you.

225
00:22:03,215 --> 00:22:05,553
Keep your eyes and your mouth
closed when that happens.

226
00:22:05,553 --> 00:22:07,055
You got it?

227
00:22:07,055 --> 00:22:10,415
Let's get out there, time is money.

228
00:22:10,415 --> 00:22:12,095
Go get 'em, tiger.

229
00:22:12,095 --> 00:22:14,692
(dramatic rock music)

230
00:22:14,692 --> 00:22:16,859
(sighing)

231
00:22:26,394 --> 00:22:29,366
(heavy breathing)

232
00:22:29,366 --> 00:22:31,699
(squeaking)

233
00:22:36,918 --> 00:22:40,418
(dramatic guitar soloing)

234
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:49,642
Mm, there are maggots
in my money shot, Dennis.

235
00:22:52,998 --> 00:22:54,415
God damn retards.

236
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,750
(giggling)

237
00:22:58,694 --> 00:23:02,169
(panicked breathing)

238
00:23:02,169 --> 00:23:03,002
Move.

239
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:06,754
Nasty bitch.

240
00:23:06,754 --> 00:23:09,837
(panicked breathing)

241
00:23:14,466 --> 00:23:16,752
Hey Sunshine, what you got for me?

242
00:23:16,752 --> 00:23:18,752
Female, average build.

243
00:23:20,247 --> 00:23:22,032
Pretty cute.
Yeah.

244
00:23:22,032 --> 00:23:23,365
It's fresh, too.

245
00:23:24,752 --> 00:23:26,835
No blemishes or anything.

246
00:23:30,192 --> 00:23:31,359
Ah, very nice.

247
00:23:33,134 --> 00:23:34,269
Got any tape?

248
00:23:34,269 --> 00:23:35,690
Oh yeah?

249
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:39,632
- Is the man in?
- Yeah, he's in the pit.

250
00:23:39,632 --> 00:23:40,465
Come on.

251
00:23:45,013 --> 00:23:48,096
(muffled rock music)

252
00:24:08,507 --> 00:24:09,924
A new one for ya.

253
00:24:13,812 --> 00:24:15,729
[Max] Yep, she'll do.

254
00:24:17,295 --> 00:24:20,212
Take her in the back with the rest.

255
00:24:28,011 --> 00:24:32,178
Dennis, get your bitch
ass over here and help me.

256
00:24:35,935 --> 00:24:37,435
Come on, let's go!

257
00:24:38,771 --> 00:24:41,832
Quit it, open the fucking door.

258
00:24:41,832 --> 00:24:42,993
(dramatic rock music)

259
00:24:42,993 --> 00:24:45,243
(growling)

260
00:24:50,617 --> 00:24:53,476
Johnny Sunshine, my
favorite piece of ass.

261
00:24:53,476 --> 00:24:55,017
That creep still taking pictures of you?

262
00:24:55,017 --> 00:24:57,577
Yeah, can't seem to
take his eyes off me.

263
00:24:57,577 --> 00:24:59,817
Nobody can, but I'm with you,

264
00:24:59,817 --> 00:25:04,793
if he's gonna be taking
pictures, he should be paying.

265
00:25:04,793 --> 00:25:05,791
I can have some of the boys...

266
00:25:05,791 --> 00:25:07,652
Don't sweat it, I can
take care of myself.

267
00:25:07,652 --> 00:25:09,492
- Fine.
- You want the tape?

268
00:25:09,492 --> 00:25:10,328
Only always.

269
00:25:10,328 --> 00:25:13,411
(muffled rock music)

270
00:25:27,479 --> 00:25:28,729
Wow, hot stuff.

271
00:25:30,476 --> 00:25:34,256
(laughing) You cut his tongue out, classy.

272
00:25:34,256 --> 00:25:35,377
Who's your co-star?

273
00:25:35,377 --> 00:25:36,821
Didn't catch his name.

274
00:25:36,821 --> 00:25:37,738
Never do.

275
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,476
Same price as always?

276
00:25:40,476 --> 00:25:42,017
Same price as always.

277
00:25:42,017 --> 00:25:43,315
Are you on for the show tomorrow?

278
00:25:43,315 --> 00:25:44,148
Yep.

279
00:25:44,148 --> 00:25:47,231
(muffled rock music)

280
00:25:51,369 --> 00:25:54,619
(dramatic metal music)

281
00:26:30,836 --> 00:26:32,900
Raid, I want you to
bring down the two cases

282
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:36,157
from the warehouse and
keep an eye on things.

283
00:26:36,157 --> 00:26:36,990
Yeah.

284
00:26:39,753 --> 00:26:41,253
Oh, you alright?

285
00:26:44,335 --> 00:26:46,918
(man mumbling)

286
00:26:57,291 --> 00:27:01,458
Raid, one of the unfortunates
that breed Max's money.

287
00:27:04,209 --> 00:27:08,376
I guess I love him, as
close as I can get, anyway.

288
00:27:10,772 --> 00:27:14,953
He and his sister Dez here run
Max's entertainment efforts.

289
00:27:14,953 --> 00:27:19,120
I ended up with Raid, but if
Dez had swung the other way,

290
00:27:20,052 --> 00:27:20,885
who knows?

291
00:27:20,885 --> 00:27:24,135
(energetic rock music)

292
00:27:31,435 --> 00:27:34,435
Ah Raid, only attracted to the dead,

293
00:27:37,201 --> 00:27:38,784
or the living dead.

294
00:27:40,257 --> 00:27:44,424
So we make due, the spice
helps him, numbs him, I think.

295
00:27:55,953 --> 00:28:00,120
We do our work, dream of
life high up in the city,

296
00:28:03,953 --> 00:28:06,036
and watch each other die.

297
00:28:16,497 --> 00:28:19,958
(dramatic ambient music)

298
00:28:19,958 --> 00:28:21,638
What's this?

299
00:28:21,638 --> 00:28:25,805
Well, bar's closed now,
there's nobody left to kill.

300
00:28:26,897 --> 00:28:29,777
Figured I might as well
give it back to you.

301
00:28:29,777 --> 00:28:30,998
I've been a good girl.

302
00:28:30,998 --> 00:28:33,220
I haven't spilled blood
in here for awhile now.

303
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:36,220
(muffled rap music)

304
00:28:41,397 --> 00:28:42,564
Why is that?

305
00:28:44,161 --> 00:28:44,994
Respect.

306
00:28:53,019 --> 00:28:54,102
And your ass.

307
00:28:58,518 --> 00:29:02,185
Hell, Johnny, it's
just another speakeasy.

308
00:29:03,275 --> 00:29:05,192
Yeah, but it's yours.

309
00:29:06,257 --> 00:29:07,924
Well, yours and his.

310
00:29:10,118 --> 00:29:13,761
A girl's got to draw the line somewhere.

311
00:29:13,761 --> 00:29:15,511
Don't kid yourself.

312
00:29:17,343 --> 00:29:20,225
You know there's no lines.

313
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:21,225
Not anymore.

314
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,638
[Johnny] Friends and enemies.

315
00:29:27,638 --> 00:29:29,563
[Dez] The living and the dead.

316
00:29:29,563 --> 00:29:32,730
[Both] Everything else is just meat.

317
00:29:34,501 --> 00:29:37,668
(dramatic rock music)

318
00:29:43,059 --> 00:29:46,982
And that, Officer Stein, is the deal.

319
00:29:46,982 --> 00:29:50,619
I delivered you your muse, your obsession,

320
00:29:50,619 --> 00:29:53,381
your precious Johnny Sunshine.

321
00:29:53,381 --> 00:29:54,659
And you walk away with enough money

322
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:58,576
to leave to the force
and buy your citizenship.

323
00:30:01,061 --> 00:30:03,228
(sighing)

324
00:30:04,523 --> 00:30:05,523
Yeah, Max.

325
00:30:07,622 --> 00:30:08,622
Did alright.

326
00:30:09,622 --> 00:30:10,662
Sounds a little like horse shit to me.

327
00:30:10,662 --> 00:30:13,162
(gun cocking)

328
00:30:14,923 --> 00:30:17,243
From your very next breath,
you're operating on a level

329
00:30:17,243 --> 00:30:20,262
you've never experienced
before, Officer Stein.

330
00:30:20,262 --> 00:30:24,763
Alright, just making sure
that you're the right guy

331
00:30:24,763 --> 00:30:28,523
to be doing it, and I gotta go to work.

332
00:30:28,523 --> 00:30:30,557
Time is, you know.

333
00:30:30,557 --> 00:30:32,321
There's one more thing,

334
00:30:32,321 --> 00:30:35,404
perhaps I should say two more things.

335
00:30:37,121 --> 00:30:41,437
The long haired fucking
boyfriend that works at my bar?

336
00:30:41,437 --> 00:30:43,739
He'll need to be eliminated.

337
00:30:43,739 --> 00:30:47,906
Your little photos have made
Johnny rather suspicious.

338
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:53,019
He'll come here looking for that.

339
00:30:53,019 --> 00:30:55,819
Let him take a pinch, let him have a hit,

340
00:30:55,819 --> 00:30:59,986
he'll expect it, but take
him out here, and do it soon.

341
00:31:02,182 --> 00:31:03,839
The other one of the triad of their

342
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:06,422
little trio is his sister, Dez.

343
00:31:07,259 --> 00:31:08,283
She's the little dark haired

344
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:10,742
bouncer down at the bar you've seen.

345
00:31:10,742 --> 00:31:13,563
She needs to be taken care of too.

346
00:31:13,563 --> 00:31:15,441
That way there will be nothing

347
00:31:15,441 --> 00:31:19,045
that stands between you
and your precious Johnny.

348
00:31:19,045 --> 00:31:20,128
Are we clear?

349
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,409
(sighing)

350
00:31:23,409 --> 00:31:24,409
I'm clear.

351
00:31:25,964 --> 00:31:27,381
One more thing.

352
00:31:30,789 --> 00:31:34,405
Don't do her until the camera's rolling.

353
00:31:34,405 --> 00:31:36,927
Everything hinges on that footage.

354
00:31:36,927 --> 00:31:40,677
You can leave your bloody
past in The Sprawl.

355
00:31:42,869 --> 00:31:46,186
Put some panties on her or
something, something real nice.

356
00:31:46,186 --> 00:31:47,853
Now it's time to go.

357
00:31:53,909 --> 00:31:57,326
(dramatic ambient music)

358
00:32:06,851 --> 00:32:09,066
[Johnny] Stupid fucking zombies.

359
00:32:09,066 --> 00:32:10,085
Sometimes I think I only do this

360
00:32:10,085 --> 00:32:12,885
only because it isn't popular.

361
00:32:12,885 --> 00:32:17,509
Nobody wants to fight them,
but everyone wants them dead.

362
00:32:17,509 --> 00:32:18,709
Or worse.

363
00:32:18,709 --> 00:32:21,626
(eerie rock music)

364
00:33:25,397 --> 00:33:28,335
(dramatic metal music)

365
00:33:28,335 --> 00:33:31,252
Raid lost out, he got the opposite.

366
00:33:32,495 --> 00:33:34,213
A legitimate love for the dead

367
00:33:34,213 --> 00:33:37,571
that transcends his
human genetic imperative.

368
00:33:37,571 --> 00:33:40,488
A cursed necrophile, like a maggot.

369
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:47,114
Maybe the ultimate joke on evolution is

370
00:33:47,114 --> 00:33:50,281
that we are all something else's meat.

371
00:33:52,474 --> 00:33:54,410
(static buzzing)

372
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:57,327
(eerie rock music)

373
00:33:59,535 --> 00:34:01,930
The zombies aren't even people man,

374
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:05,114
just meat, there for the taking.

375
00:34:05,114 --> 00:34:07,791
Sometimes I think they
know something we don't.

376
00:34:07,791 --> 00:34:09,978
(static buzzing)

377
00:34:09,978 --> 00:34:13,553
Sometimes I see it in their eyes.

378
00:34:13,553 --> 00:34:15,553
The pain and the hatred.

379
00:34:18,869 --> 00:34:22,005
There's awareness, it's
in there somewhere.

380
00:34:22,005 --> 00:34:24,311
(static buzzing)

381
00:34:24,311 --> 00:34:27,478
(dramatic rock music)

382
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:37,572
(ominous electronic music)

383
00:34:44,787 --> 00:34:47,120
[Johnny] Just look at her.

384
00:34:52,047 --> 00:34:52,880
Supple.

385
00:34:55,727 --> 00:34:57,144
Warm and unaware.

386
00:34:58,025 --> 00:35:00,358
(screaming)

387
00:35:03,767 --> 00:35:05,326
Pump enough drugs into their system

388
00:35:05,326 --> 00:35:07,283
and even torture seems like fun.

389
00:35:07,283 --> 00:35:10,866
(ominous electronic music)

390
00:35:15,923 --> 00:35:16,756
I hate them.

391
00:35:16,756 --> 00:35:19,241
(choking)

392
00:35:19,241 --> 00:35:20,908
I want to hurt them.

393
00:35:22,681 --> 00:35:24,431
I want to use them up

394
00:35:26,745 --> 00:35:28,412
and throw them away.

395
00:35:30,025 --> 00:35:31,022
I live for it.

396
00:35:31,022 --> 00:35:33,278
(man yelling)

397
00:35:33,278 --> 00:35:35,621
(speaking quickly)

398
00:35:35,621 --> 00:35:38,937
(man yelling)

399
00:35:38,937 --> 00:35:42,414
I can't scrape it off
my skin so I embrace it.

400
00:35:42,414 --> 00:35:44,777
(man yelling)

401
00:35:44,777 --> 00:35:45,777
I become it.

402
00:35:47,998 --> 00:35:49,415
I make it my own.

403
00:35:52,196 --> 00:35:53,886
(man yelling)

404
00:35:53,886 --> 00:35:57,469

406
00:36:19,423 --> 00:36:22,003
(heavy breathing)

407
00:36:22,003 --> 00:36:25,170
(intense metal music)

408
00:36:27,565 --> 00:36:30,065

409
00:36:43,892 --> 00:36:44,849

415
00:37:18,892 --> 00:37:21,392
(man yelling)

416
00:37:32,428 --> 00:37:33,628
Who the fuck?

417
00:37:33,628 --> 00:37:36,625
(eerie music)

418
00:37:36,625 --> 00:37:38,828
[Johnny] I've gotta let
this thing into a routine.

419
00:37:38,828 --> 00:37:42,078
(dramatic metal music)

420
00:37:49,628 --> 00:37:50,461
Hmm.

421
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:56,622
Used that one recently.

422
00:38:01,105 --> 00:38:02,220
This has been awhile.

423
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:05,470
(dramatic metal music)

424
00:38:23,151 --> 00:38:25,129
Right there will be nice.

425
00:38:25,129 --> 00:38:25,962
(stapler impacting)

426
00:38:25,962 --> 00:38:28,505
(gasping)

427
00:38:28,505 --> 00:38:29,503
And there.

428
00:38:29,503 --> 00:38:32,184
(stapler impacting)

429
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:33,225
And right there.

430
00:38:33,225 --> 00:38:34,948
(dramatic metal music)

431
00:38:34,948 --> 00:38:37,316
(whimpering)

432
00:38:37,316 --> 00:38:38,149
Mm.

433
00:38:44,102 --> 00:38:45,204
I need the blood.

434
00:38:45,204 --> 00:38:48,454
(dramatic metal music)

435
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:56,598
I love to watch them shiver.

436
00:38:59,423 --> 00:39:01,256
I need something more.

437
00:39:04,367 --> 00:39:05,200
But what?

438
00:39:08,308 --> 00:39:10,272
I need to take another route with this.

439
00:39:10,272 --> 00:39:12,689
(whimpering)

440
00:39:13,616 --> 00:39:15,199
Sweet, tender meat.

441
00:39:17,093 --> 00:39:18,634
I think I'll get a slice.

442
00:39:18,634 --> 00:39:21,884
(dramatic metal music)

443
00:39:27,963 --> 00:39:29,380
Hmm, penetration.

444
00:39:44,294 --> 00:39:45,461
A little lube.

445
00:39:53,222 --> 00:39:55,899
Fucking cunt, I'm gonna fuck

446
00:39:55,899 --> 00:39:59,478
this bitch with something bigger.

447
00:39:59,478 --> 00:40:01,895
I need something to slide in.

448
00:40:05,238 --> 00:40:06,071
And out.

449
00:40:07,835 --> 00:40:09,168
All the way out.

450
00:40:15,158 --> 00:40:17,158
Ribbed for her pleasure.

451
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,863
So this cunt wants to
get her pussy fucked?

452
00:40:26,902 --> 00:40:29,484
Well now her pussy is fucked.

453
00:40:29,484 --> 00:40:32,651
(intense metal music)

454
00:40:34,162 --> 00:40:36,780
Just a tickle, tickle.

455
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:37,783
(yelping)

456
00:40:37,783 --> 00:40:40,950
(ominous vocal music)

457
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:45,863
Tickle.
(yelping)

458
00:40:45,863 --> 00:40:46,696
Tickle.

459
00:40:47,644 --> 00:40:48,477
Tickle.

460
00:40:48,477 --> 00:40:51,644
(ominous vocal music)

461
00:40:55,056 --> 00:40:57,389

464

(screaming)

465
00:41:13,481 --> 00:41:15,064
This is what sells.

466
00:41:16,438 --> 00:41:18,180
(screaming)

467
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:20,097
Just another kill fuck.

468

(shower water trickling)

(intense metal music)

471
00:41:48,824 --> 00:41:50,585
Where have you been?

472
00:41:50,585 --> 00:41:52,340
Moving a body.

473
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:54,025
[Johnny] Took your sweet time.

474
00:41:54,025 --> 00:41:55,025
Yes I did.

475
00:41:56,003 --> 00:41:58,420
Sorry if I smell like corpse.

476
00:42:02,003 --> 00:42:03,253
It was alone.

477
00:42:04,383 --> 00:42:06,009
I know.

478
00:42:06,009 --> 00:42:08,592
(man mumbling)

479
00:42:11,313 --> 00:42:15,131
♫ Reminding me of the
necessity of sobriety

480
00:42:15,131 --> 00:42:19,457
♫ Still fighting that cancer,
still searching for an answer

481
00:42:19,457 --> 00:42:22,588
♫ To questions that I do not want to know

482
00:42:22,588 --> 00:42:23,931
♫ And perhaps I should give up

483
00:42:23,931 --> 00:42:27,713
♫ Because maybe I don't wanna
know how to kill this parasite

484
00:42:27,713 --> 00:42:29,473
♫ Oh baby, I think I might

485
00:42:29,473 --> 00:42:31,873
♫ Carefully remove it
with pinpoint precision

486
00:42:31,873 --> 00:42:34,753
♫ So I can finally have my way with it

487
00:42:34,753 --> 00:42:39,153
♫ Still I made the decision,
time to make the incision

488
00:42:39,153 --> 00:42:41,095
♫ And having my way with this pain

489
00:42:41,095 --> 00:42:45,262
♫ Is better than I ever
could have envisioned

490
00:42:47,093 --> 00:42:50,426
(dramatic string music)

491
00:42:57,746 --> 00:42:59,810

(gasping)

494
00:43:51,901 --> 00:43:55,576
[Raid] Students have secret names.

495
00:43:55,576 --> 00:43:58,576
The undead have voices of the hound.

496
00:44:05,016 --> 00:44:08,183
(dramatic rock music)

497
00:44:17,523 --> 00:44:20,621
Maybe it really is the end of the world.

(growling)

503
00:45:02,327 --> 00:45:04,926
They are not affected.

504
00:45:04,926 --> 00:45:07,351
The crowd doesn't care.

505
00:45:07,351 --> 00:45:09,244
They've seen it all before.

506
00:45:09,244 --> 00:45:12,471
You don't survive The Sprawl
if you aren't one of the hard.

507
00:45:12,471 --> 00:45:13,971
One of the frozen.

508
00:45:15,948 --> 00:45:19,148
But still, they come
just like everyone else.

509
00:45:19,148 --> 00:45:20,148
Like me.

510
00:45:20,148 --> 00:45:22,398

(eerie music)

545
00:50:44,855 --> 00:50:46,272
I am a hurricane.

546
00:50:51,596 --> 00:50:52,929
I live for this.

547
00:50:57,566 --> 00:50:59,316
Every perfect moment.

548

("Star Spangled Banner")

551
00:51:17,627 --> 00:51:20,448
As we all know, the federal
government is incapable of

552
00:51:20,448 --> 00:51:23,669
delivering the kind of support
this city desperately needs.

553
00:51:23,669 --> 00:51:26,447
It's up to the city to
raise the funds we need

554
00:51:26,447 --> 00:51:30,946
to maintain security in
these dangerous times.

555
00:51:30,946 --> 00:51:32,747
Regulation is a dead concept

556
00:51:32,747 --> 00:51:37,291
and the moral opposition
has all but disappeared.

557
00:51:37,291 --> 00:51:40,047
The entertainment industry
is virtually untapped

558
00:51:40,047 --> 00:51:43,047
within the walls of the city proper.

559
00:51:45,248 --> 00:51:46,832
The lights, get the lights.

560
00:51:46,832 --> 00:51:47,999
[Man] Sorry.

561
00:51:51,712 --> 00:51:52,545
Sorry.

562
00:51:54,965 --> 00:51:56,352
[Man] No, pan to the chart.

563
00:51:56,352 --> 00:51:58,247
[Man] No, no, pan to the chart.

564
00:51:58,247 --> 00:52:00,672
[Man] No, pan to the chart.

565
00:52:00,672 --> 00:52:01,909
Pan, what's on the list?

566
00:52:01,909 --> 00:52:04,331
[Man] I can't see the list.

567
00:52:04,331 --> 00:52:05,168
[Man] Where's the light?

568
00:52:05,168 --> 00:52:07,104
[Man] Where's the light?

569
00:52:07,104 --> 00:52:08,937
I can't see.
Oh shit.

570
00:52:10,645 --> 00:52:12,062
Pan to the chart.

571
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:15,205
[Man] I'm not moving the fucking camera.

572
00:52:15,205 --> 00:52:17,122
[Man] Show the chart.

573
00:52:18,255 --> 00:52:20,981
[Man] You two are fucking fired.

574
00:52:20,981 --> 00:52:24,148
(intense metal music)

575
00:52:27,067 --> 00:52:29,344
It's closing time.

576
00:52:29,344 --> 00:52:30,844
Wake up, dead boy.

577
00:52:39,627 --> 00:52:40,484
- Hey, come on.
- Hey.

578
00:52:40,484 --> 00:52:42,427
It's time to go.

579
00:52:42,427 --> 00:52:43,510
Motherfucker.

580
00:52:46,666 --> 00:52:49,083
Get the fuck out you piece of shit.

581
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:52,250
(intense metal music)

582
00:52:57,978 --> 00:53:00,504
Looking good, doll.

583
00:53:00,504 --> 00:53:02,563
Just another day at the office.

584
00:53:02,563 --> 00:53:04,584
Got started a little early.

585
00:53:04,584 --> 00:53:08,504
Didn't have a choice, the
dead don't punch a timecard.

586
00:53:08,504 --> 00:53:11,085
I guess they don't.

587
00:53:11,085 --> 00:53:12,168
Well we do.

588
00:53:28,344 --> 00:53:30,344
You know, most people,

589
00:53:31,242 --> 00:53:33,507
death just doesn't become them.

590
00:53:33,507 --> 00:53:36,174
Something's lost in translation.

591
00:53:38,744 --> 00:53:43,123
I don't think you'd lose it,
there's something about you,

592
00:53:43,123 --> 00:53:45,456
your nose, cheekbones, skin.

593
00:53:47,901 --> 00:53:49,984
No, you'd look good dead.

594
00:53:50,941 --> 00:53:52,901
Don't even think about it,

595
00:53:52,901 --> 00:53:55,461
you couldn't get it up if you tried.

596
00:53:55,461 --> 00:53:58,503
Fuck you, Johnny, if
it wasn't for the porn,

597
00:53:58,503 --> 00:54:02,670
guys like me, be glorified pest
control, like a fucking cop.

598
00:54:06,675 --> 00:54:08,941
Raid, if it wasn't
for the thought of you

599
00:54:08,941 --> 00:54:12,191
savagely penetrating my rotting corpse,

600
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:17,283
I don't think I could ever die.

601
00:54:20,003 --> 00:54:20,861
Careful, Johnny.

602
00:54:20,861 --> 00:54:24,028
(intense metal music)

603
00:54:41,768 --> 00:54:44,768
(muffled rap music)

604
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:52,517
[Dez] I'm done.

605
00:54:54,502 --> 00:54:55,585
Thanks, Raid.

606
00:54:59,912 --> 00:55:01,579
How's my business?

607
00:55:02,833 --> 00:55:03,750
Adequate.

608
00:55:09,853 --> 00:55:10,770
Adequate?

609
00:55:22,191 --> 00:55:23,774
How's the bar take?

610
00:55:27,233 --> 00:55:28,233
The usual.

611
00:55:33,175 --> 00:55:35,416
How's spice sales?

612
00:55:35,416 --> 00:55:37,480
Flows, spice flows.

613
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:40,972
So I suppose my health
inspector came by?

614
00:55:40,972 --> 00:55:43,000
Yeah, he was happy.

615
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,659
[Max] So we passed inspection.

616
00:55:44,659 --> 00:55:45,992
Flying colors.

617
00:55:46,877 --> 00:55:47,710
Good.

618
00:55:48,616 --> 00:55:51,116
You want anything for the bar?

619
00:55:55,070 --> 00:55:58,820
Red Dead, Private
Punishment, Kinky Ferret.

620
00:56:00,796 --> 00:56:03,633
Get it from Sam this time.

621
00:56:03,633 --> 00:56:06,555
Now speaking of the spice,

622
00:56:06,555 --> 00:56:08,931
got a larger than usual
shipment coming in.

623
00:56:08,931 --> 00:56:11,848
I want you to handle it personally.

624
00:56:14,449 --> 00:56:15,282
Can do.

625
00:56:16,449 --> 00:56:19,292
Now you know you're on
your last legs with me, Raid.

626
00:56:19,292 --> 00:56:21,073
You don't fuck this up.

627
00:56:21,073 --> 00:56:23,612
This is the time and the place.

628
00:56:23,612 --> 00:56:27,313
It smells a little funny
because he's a cop.

629
00:56:27,313 --> 00:56:31,480
His name is Stein, he's
dirty and he's in my pocket.

630
00:56:33,212 --> 00:56:34,962
Never heard of him.

631
00:56:36,009 --> 00:56:37,509
Is there a reason?

632
00:56:39,553 --> 00:56:42,636
You have a fucking problem with it?

633
00:56:45,137 --> 00:56:47,387
Then pour me another drink?

634
00:56:50,311 --> 00:56:51,144
Yes sir.

635
00:56:55,296 --> 00:56:58,463
(dramatic rock music)

636
00:57:06,672 --> 00:57:10,089
(dramatic ambient music)

637
00:57:41,298 --> 00:57:43,990
(gun cocking)

638
00:57:43,990 --> 00:57:46,657
(phone ringing)

639
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:50,297
(phone ringing)

640
00:57:51,787 --> 00:57:52,620
Yeah?

641
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:54,782
[Operator] Please enter
a tone to accept charges.

642
00:57:54,782 --> 00:57:57,680
(phone beeping)

643
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:58,513
Yep.

644
00:57:58,513 --> 00:58:00,905
(muffled talking on phone)

645
00:58:00,905 --> 00:58:02,827
Yeah, first part's done, it's finished.

646
00:58:02,827 --> 00:58:04,247
[Max] Now you just need the
corpse lover out of the way.

647
00:58:04,247 --> 00:58:05,080
Mm-hmm.

648
00:58:06,301 --> 00:58:08,585
(muffled talking on phone)

649
00:58:08,585 --> 00:58:10,345
You set up the meeting.

650
00:58:10,345 --> 00:58:11,528
(muffled talking on phone)

651
00:58:11,528 --> 00:58:12,361
Yeah.

652
00:58:13,302 --> 00:58:14,766
I'll take care of the pre-vert.

653
00:58:14,766 --> 00:58:16,324
[Max] You'd better get it straight.

654
00:58:16,324 --> 00:58:19,657
(ominous ambient music)

655
00:59:08,803 --> 00:59:11,053
Shitty day, no different.

656
00:59:14,326 --> 00:59:17,147
Change up our equipment.

657
00:59:17,147 --> 00:59:19,067
Say the production's down at the force,

658
00:59:19,067 --> 00:59:22,984
so we got a 50 year old
phone, 50 year old gun,

659
00:59:24,027 --> 00:59:27,277
something's always wrong in production.

660
00:59:29,126 --> 00:59:33,293
Went out last night and
got a call from the family.

661
00:59:35,665 --> 00:59:36,629
A zombie raid.

662
00:59:36,629 --> 00:59:38,223
(ambient screaming and gunfire)

663
00:59:38,223 --> 00:59:40,385
We were too late, always too late.

664
00:59:40,385 --> 00:59:44,385
(ambient screaming and gunfire)

665
00:59:46,550 --> 00:59:49,967
(dramatic ambient music)

666
01:00:05,387 --> 01:00:07,804
I took the smut perv's offer.

667
01:00:09,510 --> 01:00:12,895
Gonna die in a clean, well-lighted place

668
01:00:12,895 --> 01:00:14,728
alone in the big city.

669
01:00:25,344 --> 01:00:29,511
There's a fine line between
discipline and obsession.

670
01:00:31,278 --> 01:00:33,875
I've chosen to cross it.

671
01:00:33,875 --> 01:00:35,651
(reversed speaking)

672
01:00:35,651 --> 01:00:37,772
I've chosen to cross it.

673
01:00:37,772 --> 01:00:39,054
Obsession.

674
01:00:39,054 --> 01:00:42,471
(dramatic ambient music)

675
01:00:57,155 --> 01:01:00,572
(dramatic ambient music)

676
01:01:04,871 --> 01:01:07,952
(camera humming)

677
01:01:07,952 --> 01:01:10,119
(beeping)

678
01:01:13,032 --> 01:01:16,199
(dramatic rock music)

679
01:01:36,094 --> 01:01:38,344
(groaning)

680
01:02:00,025 --> 01:02:02,358
(squishing)

681
01:02:07,785 --> 01:02:11,202
(dramatic ambient music)

682
01:02:18,846 --> 01:02:21,346
(gun cocking)

683
01:02:25,523 --> 01:02:26,526
[Stein] Yeah?

684
01:02:26,526 --> 01:02:28,083
You Stein?

685
01:02:28,083 --> 01:02:29,166
Come on in.

686
01:02:43,107 --> 01:02:45,145
How's the weather out there?

687
01:02:45,145 --> 01:02:47,725
Shitty, like always.

688
01:02:47,725 --> 01:02:49,058
I need a sample.

689
01:02:50,938 --> 01:02:52,174
Coming right up.

690
01:02:52,174 --> 01:02:55,341
(dramatic rock music)

691
01:03:00,659 --> 01:03:02,142
Have a taste.

692
01:03:02,142 --> 01:03:03,809
Roll 'em up, buster.

693
01:03:15,106 --> 01:03:16,939
Hmm, care for a pinch?

694
01:03:17,979 --> 01:03:18,812
Mm.

695
01:03:20,323 --> 01:03:22,643
Yeah, you got a subdermal?

696
01:03:22,643 --> 01:03:25,643
Nah, little old fashioned grinder.

697
01:03:26,603 --> 01:03:27,520
Right here.

698
01:03:33,052 --> 01:03:35,282
[Raid] Ooh, that is antiquated.

699
01:03:35,282 --> 01:03:38,449
(dramatic rock music)

700
01:03:48,146 --> 01:03:52,023
It's hard to find shit
like this these days.

701
01:03:52,023 --> 01:03:55,906
Certainly not at your local gas station.

702
01:03:55,906 --> 01:03:58,625
If you could, we
wouldn't be in business.

703
01:03:58,625 --> 01:03:59,458
(splattering and gurgling)

704
01:03:59,458 --> 01:04:02,625
(intense metal music)

705
01:04:03,783 --> 01:04:06,033
(groaning)

706
01:04:09,063 --> 01:04:10,881
(groaning)

707
01:04:10,881 --> 01:04:13,131
(grunting)

708
01:04:18,323 --> 01:04:20,573
(grunting)

709
01:04:24,148 --> 01:04:24,981
Yeah.

710
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:32,282
(dramatic ambient music)

711
01:05:46,819 --> 01:05:48,258
Hey there sweetie pie,

712
01:05:48,258 --> 01:05:50,713
this used to be your pre-vert boyfriend.

713
01:05:50,713 --> 01:05:52,761
Observe the lack of face.

714
01:05:52,761 --> 01:05:56,382
Meet me at Big Tom's wood
shop, Detective Stein.

715
01:05:56,382 --> 01:05:59,799
(dramatic ambient music)

716
01:06:19,822 --> 01:06:22,605
(static buzzing)

717
01:06:22,605 --> 01:06:24,522
The cops are nothing.

718
01:06:26,542 --> 01:06:28,958
Their hands are tied
patrolling the streets,

719
01:06:28,958 --> 01:06:33,061
whacking zombies and cleaning
up all the fucking murders.

720
01:06:33,061 --> 01:06:37,699
That's why Stein came to
me, you know, he wanted out.

721
01:06:37,699 --> 01:06:38,949
And the timing.

722
01:06:40,478 --> 01:06:42,679
The timing was perfect.

723
01:06:42,679 --> 01:06:46,878
Sails of the great Johnny
Sunshine have started to wane.

724
01:06:46,878 --> 01:06:47,881
So what do you do when the shit

725
01:06:47,881 --> 01:06:50,702
hot slayer isn't so hot anymore?

726
01:06:50,702 --> 01:06:53,598
(static buzzing)

727
01:06:53,598 --> 01:06:56,681
You feed her back to the sheep, of course.

728
01:06:56,681 --> 01:06:59,781
And Stein was more obsessed than most.

729
01:06:59,781 --> 01:07:04,462
A 50/50 split in the most
profitable snuff film ever made,

730
01:07:04,462 --> 01:07:06,795
The Fall of Johnny Sunshine.

731
01:07:08,525 --> 01:07:11,442
And I orchestrated the whole thing.

732
01:07:16,702 --> 01:07:20,105
Anybody would have taken that deal.

733
01:07:20,105 --> 01:07:23,065
Stein just went fucking mad.

734
01:07:23,065 --> 01:07:25,401
(static buzzing)

735
01:07:25,401 --> 01:07:28,734
(ominous ambient music)

736
01:07:44,917 --> 01:07:47,750
Knew you'd accept my invitation.

737
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:53,877
Too bad your friends couldn't be here.

738
01:07:53,877 --> 01:07:57,794
Guess they're busy,
sucking on fucking maggots.

739
01:08:00,901 --> 01:08:01,734
Let's do it.

740
01:08:01,734 --> 01:08:03,386
(reversed speaking) Let's do it.

741
01:08:03,386 --> 01:08:06,553
(intense metal music)

742
01:08:27,422 --> 01:08:28,255
(whimpering)

743
01:08:28,255 --> 01:08:31,422
(intense metal music)

744
01:08:41,340 --> 01:08:42,500
(grunting)

745
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:45,667
(intense metal music)

746
01:08:57,448 --> 01:09:00,865
("Star Spangled Banner")

747
01:09:11,308 --> 01:09:13,650
Taxes on the considerable
revenues my business

748
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:17,368
already creates are not
enforceable out here in The Sprawl.

749
01:09:17,368 --> 01:09:19,688
Why the majority of my
recession-proof profits

750
01:09:19,688 --> 01:09:21,890
come from inside the city walls,

751
01:09:21,890 --> 01:09:25,140
with no foreseeable decrease in demand.

752
01:09:25,992 --> 01:09:28,728
The Dark Endearment and Slayer,

753
01:09:28,728 --> 01:09:31,329
Coming of the Champion series have vaulted

754
01:09:31,329 --> 01:09:35,496
Maximum Productions into the
international film market.

755
01:09:36,408 --> 01:09:39,352
I'm sure you're all familiar
with the disturbingly popular

756
01:09:39,352 --> 01:09:43,309
Johnny Sunshine anthology
which has recently plateaued

757
01:09:43,309 --> 01:09:47,059
in both urban sprawl
and city proper markets.

758
01:09:51,490 --> 01:09:53,570
Now make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen,

759
01:09:53,570 --> 01:09:56,820
she's still a superstar but I'm the one

760
01:09:58,488 --> 01:10:01,655
who knows what you really want to see.

761
01:10:03,730 --> 01:10:07,147
(dramatic ambient music)

762
01:10:11,986 --> 01:10:15,208
(grunting and heavy breathing)

763
01:10:15,208 --> 01:10:16,509
You like it in the butt?

764
01:10:16,509 --> 01:10:17,970
Ugh.

765
01:10:17,970 --> 01:10:18,803
Fuck yeah.

766
01:10:18,803 --> 01:10:21,272
(moaning)

767
01:10:21,272 --> 01:10:25,432
Stars and stripes, baby,
stars and fucking stripes.

768
01:10:25,432 --> 01:10:28,968
(grunting and moaning)

769
01:10:28,968 --> 01:10:32,301
You ready for a chocolate mustache, huh?

770
01:10:34,392 --> 01:10:36,792
Probably bite my dick off, wouldn't you?

771
01:10:36,792 --> 01:10:38,253
(gasping)

772
01:10:38,253 --> 01:10:41,794
Gonna have to break your fucking neck

773
01:10:41,794 --> 01:10:44,711
with my fucking dick in your mouth.

774
01:10:46,056 --> 01:10:47,473
It's pretty sense

775
01:10:49,829 --> 01:10:51,095
and real.

776
01:10:51,095 --> 01:10:52,360
(gasping)
Oh yeah.

777
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:55,918
(grunting and moaning)

778
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:58,472
(ominous ambient music)

779
01:10:58,472 --> 01:11:00,639
(sighing)

780
01:11:26,012 --> 01:11:26,845
Wake up.

781
01:11:42,990 --> 01:11:43,823
Wake up.

782
01:11:46,130 --> 01:11:48,713
Guess I know what I have to do.

783
01:11:50,667 --> 01:11:51,500
Wake up!

784
01:11:54,665 --> 01:11:58,450
Don't want you to miss the
biggest show of your whole life.

785
01:11:58,450 --> 01:12:02,617
Supposed to wait til the
camera was rolling to fuck you.

786
01:12:04,247 --> 01:12:06,580
I just couldn't help myself.

787
01:12:11,650 --> 01:12:14,667
Now what are we gonna do to occupy

788
01:12:14,667 --> 01:12:18,224
our time while I get my second wind?

789
01:12:18,224 --> 01:12:21,641
(dramatic ambient music)

790
01:12:27,979 --> 01:12:30,229
(grunting)

791
01:12:34,922 --> 01:12:39,462
You can't imagine what it's
like watching a creature

792
01:12:39,462 --> 01:12:42,045
so beautiful waste such a gift.

793
01:12:46,042 --> 01:12:47,536
Hmm?

794
01:12:47,536 --> 01:12:49,659
Ready for the ham sandwich?

795
01:12:49,659 --> 01:12:51,909
(grunting)

796
01:12:58,459 --> 01:12:59,292
(coughing)

797
01:12:59,292 --> 01:13:01,542
(laughing)

798
01:13:05,238 --> 01:13:08,238
You're not a killer, you're a whore.

799
01:13:09,755 --> 01:13:13,922
And that camera that exalts
you makes you a whore.

800
01:13:15,718 --> 01:13:16,801
Ready, ready?

801
01:13:17,638 --> 01:13:19,888
(grunting)

802
01:13:21,138 --> 01:13:22,888
Oh no, no don't fade.

803
01:13:23,858 --> 01:13:27,062
Oh, my little angel, don't fade.

804
01:13:27,062 --> 01:13:31,462
Oh, my goddess. (Laughing)

805
01:13:31,462 --> 01:13:36,459
You see this set up is
taking a little while, right?

806
01:13:36,459 --> 01:13:41,344
I mean, you've gotten
photos, you've seen going on,

807
01:13:41,344 --> 01:13:45,718
and you just walked into
a pretty little spiderweb.

808
01:13:45,718 --> 01:13:47,403
Pretty little spider.

809
01:13:47,403 --> 01:13:48,864
Oh, no?

810
01:13:48,864 --> 01:13:50,781
Eyelids, keep 'em open.

811
01:13:52,203 --> 01:13:54,283
We're gonna do this right.

812
01:13:54,283 --> 01:13:56,533
(coughing)

813
01:13:58,523 --> 01:14:00,872
(belching)

814
01:14:00,872 --> 01:14:03,478
Come back to me, come on.

815
01:14:03,478 --> 01:14:07,395
You know in this world,
you're either a zombie,

816
01:14:10,998 --> 01:14:13,248
a killer, or a victim, huh?

817
01:14:18,422 --> 01:14:21,918
I used to think that you were a goddess.

818
01:14:21,918 --> 01:14:25,085
Some thirsty angel walking amongst us.

819
01:14:27,441 --> 01:14:28,941
A slayer, like me.

820
01:14:33,964 --> 01:14:37,180
But you're not smart enough, no.

821
01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:38,847
No, not fast enough.

822
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:41,717
Not tough enough.

823
01:14:44,118 --> 01:14:46,951
And the biggest difference of all,

824
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:52,278
no testosterone.

825
01:14:52,278 --> 01:14:55,445
(intense metal music)

826
01:14:56,662 --> 01:14:59,020
You know what you are?

827
01:14:59,020 --> 01:15:02,460
You're a fucking write-off, that's right.

828
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:04,300
And the man's got you fucking wrapped up

829
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:08,378
and I'm getting 50/50 on this shit.

830
01:15:08,378 --> 01:15:09,420
Are you ready?

831
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:12,587
(intense metal music)

832
01:15:19,830 --> 01:15:23,663
(moaning and heavy breathing)

833
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:27,300
Just another

834
01:15:28,801 --> 01:15:30,134
cheap kill fuck.

835
01:15:35,276 --> 01:15:36,109
(intense metal music)

836
01:15:36,109 --> 01:15:38,526
(screaming)

837
01:15:42,396 --> 01:15:44,729
(screaming)

838
01:15:51,036 --> 01:15:55,119
Open your eyes, this is
the apocalypse culture.

839
01:15:56,657 --> 01:16:00,157
(mysterious guitar music)

840
01:16:07,596 --> 01:16:10,763
(muffled metal music)

841
01:16:13,062 --> 01:16:15,752
[Woman] The hell happened to you?

842
01:16:15,752 --> 01:16:17,585
Occupational hazard.

843
01:16:18,577 --> 01:16:19,994
Got a fresh tape.

844
01:16:21,034 --> 01:16:22,236
Uh, Max isn't here, I have a...

845
01:16:22,236 --> 01:16:24,153
Same price as always.

846
01:16:31,814 --> 01:16:33,861
[Woman] Here you go.

847
01:16:33,861 --> 01:16:35,694
And this one's free.

848
01:16:38,273 --> 01:16:39,106
Thanks.

849
01:16:39,106 --> 01:16:42,273
(muffled metal music)

850
01:16:45,274 --> 01:16:48,874
[Johnny] Max made me what I am, a star,

851
01:16:48,874 --> 01:16:51,374
a star maker, a zombie hunter.

852
01:16:53,273 --> 01:16:56,213
I knew it would end this way.

853
01:16:56,213 --> 01:16:59,046
I knew it from the very beginning.

854
01:17:00,670 --> 01:17:05,514
But because they will say
you have killed the king,

855
01:17:05,514 --> 01:17:07,308
I am the king.

856
01:17:07,308 --> 01:17:11,114
[Johnny] So when Max sold
me out, I did him a favor.

857
01:17:11,114 --> 01:17:14,453
Look around you,
Johnny, flesh is a prison.

858
01:17:14,453 --> 01:17:16,672
[Johnny] No tombstones.

859
01:17:16,672 --> 01:17:17,505
So.

860
01:17:18,692 --> 01:17:20,052
[Johnny] No eulogy.

861
01:17:20,052 --> 01:17:21,829
Fuck regret.

862
01:17:21,829 --> 01:17:24,579
[Johnny] I let him die on film.

863
01:17:26,234 --> 01:17:28,453
(gun firing)

864
01:17:28,453 --> 01:17:31,703
(dramatic vocal music)

865
01:18:00,651 --> 01:18:03,818
(intense metal music)

866
01:19:30,989 --> 01:19:34,239
(dramatic vocal music)

867
01:19:49,673 --> 01:19:52,673
(dramatic clanking)
