1
00:00:09,541 --> 00:00:10,442
<i>Hey, buddy.</i>

2
00:00:10,476 --> 00:00:15,314
<i>Just got a postcard...</i>

3
00:00:15,346 --> 00:00:17,617
<i>from Nathaniel,</i>

4
00:00:17,649 --> 00:00:20,253
<i>and this is what it says...</i>

5
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:22,855
<i>"Dear Stilly,"</i>

6
00:00:22,888 --> 00:00:27,393
<i>our leader has asked me to
invite you up here to Ragnarok.</i>

7
00:00:27,425 --> 00:00:29,628
<i>If you can round up
Pitman and David</i>

8
00:00:29,661 --> 00:00:33,499
<i>we know that we have an incredible
subject for a documentary.</i>

9
00:00:33,531 --> 00:00:34,566
<i>If you are interested</i>

10
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,768
<i>meet me in the Winnett bar
in Winnett Montana</i>

11
00:00:36,801 --> 00:00:41,841
<i>sometime between 2pm and 4pm
on July 13th.</i>

12
00:00:41,874 --> 00:00:45,478
<i>If you are not there,
this is my goodbye.</i>

13
00:00:45,511 --> 00:00:47,679
<i>"You have always been
a true friend"</i>

14
00:00:47,713 --> 00:00:50,783
<i>and this is in capitols,
"WE NEED YOUR HELP."</i>

15
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,655
<i>I'm calling up Davy.</i>

16
00:00:55,688 --> 00:00:58,091
<i>I think we are probably
gonna be headed north.</i>

17
00:01:00,859 --> 00:01:04,496
Those people he's with,
and him there, I mean...

18
00:01:05,897 --> 00:01:08,834
I've meet some of them.
They're awesome, they're crazy.

19
00:01:08,867 --> 00:01:12,471
We've had
crazy deep conversations.

20
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,210
So I don't know how deep their
conversations are going these days!

21
00:01:18,243 --> 00:01:20,346
I don't know man,
I feel like I can be

22
00:01:20,379 --> 00:01:22,548
one step away sometimes
from sending somebody

23
00:01:22,581 --> 00:01:24,650
a postcard like that.

24
00:01:24,683 --> 00:01:28,621
I think that-I think that
it's gonna be... awesome!

25
00:01:29,921 --> 00:01:32,858
I'm excited!
I'm excited for this!

26
00:01:32,891 --> 00:01:35,227
We're in between projects.

27
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:37,229
I mean...
it makes perfect sense.

28
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:38,331
Why wouldn't we go do this?

29
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:40,832
We've always kind of wanted
to make a documentary.

30
00:01:40,865 --> 00:01:43,368
My initial reaction is that
I didn't want to go.

31
00:01:43,402 --> 00:01:45,572
I was like, "screw that."

32
00:01:46,805 --> 00:01:49,142
And then you guys were like
"Yeah, yeah it's fun.

33
00:01:49,174 --> 00:01:50,409
It's gonna be fun, excited."

34
00:01:50,442 --> 00:01:53,179
And I was like, what are they
not reading that I'm reading.

35
00:01:53,212 --> 00:01:58,183
Why are you guys not worried
about this situation?

36
00:01:58,216 --> 00:02:00,685
I mean the postcard
is really weird.

37
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:05,690
I am overseeing
all things sound related.

38
00:02:05,724 --> 00:02:08,294
So are you excited?

39
00:02:11,263 --> 00:02:13,231
I hope there's
some cute girls there.

40
00:02:14,332 --> 00:02:16,936
The thing that I'm
struggling with is if this a...

41
00:02:16,968 --> 00:02:18,837
cult or a commune.
That's what I...

42
00:02:18,871 --> 00:02:19,972
What's the difference?

43
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:23,710
Cults are, in my opinion,
seem much more insidious.

44
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,211
-Stilwell?
-Yeah?

45
00:02:26,245 --> 00:02:30,550
Do you think Nathaniel's gotten
himself into some real trouble?

46
00:02:30,582 --> 00:02:32,919
No. I don't.

47
00:02:32,951 --> 00:02:37,889
Like... I don't know what it is,
but I don't think trouble.

48
00:02:37,923 --> 00:02:40,926
I really Don't.

49
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,031
That's it, isn't it?

50
00:06:07,064 --> 00:06:09,035
Welcome to Winnett.

51
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:16,442
Hey, you haven't heard
of a commune in the area?

52
00:06:16,475 --> 00:06:17,810
-Not at all?
-No.

53
00:06:17,843 --> 00:06:20,612
Where at?
Is it out at the bench, or...

54
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:22,480
Out kind of by the...

55
00:06:22,514 --> 00:06:24,115
by Mussel Shell River, or...

56
00:06:24,149 --> 00:06:27,153
Okay, there's...

57
00:06:27,185 --> 00:06:30,688
There... It's not really
so much a commune.

58
00:06:30,721 --> 00:06:34,058
It's... They're kinda
settin' down there.

59
00:06:34,091 --> 00:06:38,062
-They made their own little... niche.
-Yeah.

60
00:06:38,096 --> 00:06:39,831
-Thank you.
-You guys have a good one.

61
00:06:39,865 --> 00:06:41,167
-Take care. Bye.
-See you soon.

62
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,668
Alrighty!

63
00:06:42,701 --> 00:06:45,171
12 ounce steaks,
video gambling.

64
00:06:47,105 --> 00:06:49,475
Outside 100, inside 75.

65
00:06:49,507 --> 00:06:51,443
Where do you wanna be?

66
00:06:51,476 --> 00:06:55,213
-Where are we?
... the Winnett Bar and Grill.

67
00:06:55,247 --> 00:06:56,682
Why are we here?

68
00:06:56,714 --> 00:06:58,550
Lord knows.

69
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,519
He said to meet when?

70
00:07:00,552 --> 00:07:02,487
Between, two and four.

71
00:07:02,521 --> 00:07:04,156
Two and four.

72
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:08,761
So they very well could be
in this bar at this moment.

73
00:07:08,793 --> 00:07:09,829
Yep.

74
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:11,197
You guys lost?

75
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,466
We're not lost!

76
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:14,900
We're filmin' a movie!

77
00:07:14,932 --> 00:07:18,002
Right, the commune guys!

78
00:07:18,036 --> 00:07:20,673
What are they...
what are they like?

79
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:22,475
What do you mean what are they like?
You don't know?

80
00:07:22,507 --> 00:07:24,709
Then you're on your own,
dude.

81
00:07:27,512 --> 00:07:29,781
Yep. Here we go.

82
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:33,853
You got beers in here?

83
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:35,788
All right!

84
00:07:35,821 --> 00:07:37,189
Doesn't mean you get any.

85
00:07:37,221 --> 00:07:39,824
Ooh! This place is all...

86
00:07:39,858 --> 00:07:41,860
Very nice. This is great.

87
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:43,596
Is this your bar?

88
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,164
Why?

89
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:48,533
Sometimes.

90
00:07:48,567 --> 00:07:49,634
How long have you
lived in Winnett?

91
00:07:51,769 --> 00:07:53,639
Are you FBI? CIA?

92
00:07:54,773 --> 00:07:56,709
I'd say nonya!

93
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:58,644
-Nonya?
-Nonya business!

94
00:07:58,677 --> 00:08:00,278
How long have you
lived in Winnett?

95
00:08:00,312 --> 00:08:02,146
-All her life.
-All my life.

96
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,182
Really?

97
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:07,752
Have you met any of the people
living in the commune nearby?

98
00:08:07,786 --> 00:08:08,920
No, she hasn't.

99
00:08:12,591 --> 00:08:14,293
-My God.
-My...

100
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:19,064
Are you serious?

101
00:08:19,096 --> 00:08:20,698
-How you doin'?
-My God.

102
00:08:22,733 --> 00:08:25,236
This is alive!

103
00:08:25,269 --> 00:08:26,572
We weren't sure.

104
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:39,284
Yeah, that excuse
don't fly around here.

105
00:08:39,317 --> 00:08:42,221
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

106
00:08:43,288 --> 00:08:45,557
Better join...
Every-everybody...

107
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,259
Pitty's mad.

108
00:08:48,293 --> 00:08:49,360
Are you mad at me?

109
00:08:49,394 --> 00:08:52,197
I haven't heard from you
in three years.

110
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,331
I tell you what.

111
00:08:53,365 --> 00:08:56,235
When we get out there
you'll understand exactly why

112
00:08:56,268 --> 00:08:58,070
I've been gone for three years.

113
00:09:10,881 --> 00:09:12,684
You know who
we're meeting here?

114
00:09:14,318 --> 00:09:15,987
-Do I?
-Yeah.

115
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,055
Yeah.

116
00:09:37,042 --> 00:09:39,177
Whoo!

117
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:41,947
Stilwell.

118
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,316
Creek's dried up.

119
00:09:44,349 --> 00:09:46,752
-And the bus ain't runnin'.
-Shit.

120
00:09:46,784 --> 00:09:48,386
-Hey, Rizzo.
-Adam Cotton.

121
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:49,721
-Pleasure to meet you.
-You too.

122
00:09:49,754 --> 00:09:51,923
Hold on. Hey.
Adam Pitman.

123
00:09:51,956 --> 00:09:53,359
-Andrew Rizzo.
-Hi.

124
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:54,927
Hello. David.

125
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,695
Andrew Rizzo.
Pleasure to meet ya's.

126
00:09:56,727 --> 00:09:58,663
We got some problems boys.
We gotta kind of move quick.

127
00:09:58,697 --> 00:10:00,065
The bus is down.

128
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,033
You know, I am just going to be a
little transparent with you guys.

129
00:10:02,067 --> 00:10:04,637
There are some people who
are not really happy at all.

130
00:10:04,669 --> 00:10:06,704
You might be walking
into a little bit of stuff.

131
00:10:06,738 --> 00:10:08,407
You know what, the best time
to come see Ragnarok

132
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,475
is at that sun's going down.

133
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:11,343
So let's-let's D. D. Mao.
Let's get on the road.

134
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:12,276
Anyone wanna ride with me?

135
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:13,345
Pitty, you wanna go with him?

136
00:10:13,378 --> 00:10:17,416
Davy you go with...
with Rizzo.

137
00:10:17,448 --> 00:10:18,750
I'll go.
I'll ride with you.

138
00:10:18,783 --> 00:10:21,086
That's okay.
It's okay.

139
00:10:21,119 --> 00:10:24,123
I might need to put more water
in this bitch.

140
00:10:24,155 --> 00:10:26,391
-Car?
-Yeah.

141
00:10:26,424 --> 00:10:28,693
All right. I can...

142
00:10:28,726 --> 00:10:30,228
I can just use
what's in my water bottle.

143
00:10:30,261 --> 00:10:32,196
-Yeah, I'm gonna...
-Are you okay?

144
00:10:34,432 --> 00:10:36,034
Okay.

145
00:10:36,067 --> 00:10:38,670
That's what this is all about,
right?

146
00:10:38,703 --> 00:10:43,741
I don't know how, but if
you can ask him if like...

147
00:10:43,774 --> 00:10:46,678
if any of the people that are
worried about us filming,

148
00:10:46,711 --> 00:10:49,981
if... we are going to face
any hostility at all?

149
00:10:50,014 --> 00:10:52,317
-Okay.
-Like violence...

150
00:10:53,818 --> 00:10:56,721
-I... They wanted us out here.
-Let's get that sunset!

151
00:10:56,754 --> 00:10:59,692
I know. Okay. All right.

152
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:01,427
Okay, I'll see you guys
out there.

153
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,430
See you out there, brother.
Just stay close behind us.

154
00:11:08,066 --> 00:11:09,401
I am excited for this.

155
00:11:09,433 --> 00:11:12,837
I don't have any real ties
or any real...

156
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:15,707
and nothing anchoring me
and so I...

157
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:16,775
Why the hell.

158
00:11:16,808 --> 00:11:19,243
The only advice I'll give you,
sir, David, right?

159
00:11:19,277 --> 00:11:21,113
-Yeah, yeah.
-David.

160
00:11:21,145 --> 00:11:23,214
Is check you expectations
at the door

161
00:11:23,248 --> 00:11:27,319
and your assumptions at the
door and you'll do just fine.

162
00:11:27,351 --> 00:11:28,721
Got it. Easy to do.

163
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:30,822
Yeah. for some.

164
00:11:30,855 --> 00:11:33,792
'Kay, so we just
met Andrew Rizzo.

165
00:11:33,825 --> 00:11:35,294
So like when you were...

166
00:11:35,326 --> 00:11:37,328
when you wrote
in your postcard,

167
00:11:37,361 --> 00:11:40,998
the leader, is that him?
Is that... That's Rizzo?

168
00:11:41,032 --> 00:11:42,935
That's who Stilwell
thought was the leader.

169
00:11:42,967 --> 00:11:44,802
Are those your cows?

170
00:11:44,836 --> 00:11:47,505
No, These...
We don't have any cows.

171
00:11:47,538 --> 00:11:48,874
We do have sheep, though.

172
00:11:48,907 --> 00:11:49,942
I'm coffee drinker.

173
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:52,911
I brought a couple
of frappuccinos for myself...

174
00:11:52,943 --> 00:11:54,378
and for anybody
who wants one.

175
00:11:54,412 --> 00:11:55,213
Well be care... I mean...

176
00:11:55,245 --> 00:11:57,348
Like I said
it's like the natives.

177
00:11:57,381 --> 00:11:59,917
If you give the gifts,
you know...

178
00:11:59,951 --> 00:12:01,420
When I was in the army
years ago,

179
00:12:01,452 --> 00:12:02,553
when I was over in Iraq,

180
00:12:02,587 --> 00:12:05,524
you give em toilet paper
or jeans or anything like that

181
00:12:05,557 --> 00:12:07,759
you make friends real quick.

182
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:08,961
So...

183
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:12,230
Use your frappuccinos, or
whatever it is you got, wisely.

184
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:14,832
And if you are
half as laid back...

185
00:12:14,865 --> 00:12:16,901
If your half as laid back
as you are right now...

186
00:12:16,934 --> 00:12:18,836
you're gonna be fine.

187
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:21,373
-I'm pretty laid back.
-That other little guy, he seems a little nervous.

188
00:12:21,405 --> 00:12:22,606
He's a little nervous.

189
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,375
They're gonna eat him up, man.
They're gonna eat him up.

190
00:12:24,408 --> 00:12:26,144
So I'm a little worried
about the...

191
00:12:26,177 --> 00:12:29,514
the people that aren't excited
about us being out there.

192
00:12:31,015 --> 00:12:33,485
Yeah, well, you know,
you just have to understand

193
00:12:33,518 --> 00:12:37,990
that for some people cameras and
movies and things like that

194
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:40,826
are one of the symptoms
of the world

195
00:12:40,859 --> 00:12:44,562
that we're trying to...
get away from.

196
00:12:44,596 --> 00:12:46,063
So there she is.

197
00:12:46,096 --> 00:12:48,332
If you turn that camera
right over here.

198
00:12:48,365 --> 00:12:50,034
-Ghetto Gypsy.
-There it is!

199
00:12:50,067 --> 00:12:51,836
Yeah.

200
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:54,038
There it is.

201
00:12:55,206 --> 00:12:57,975
Is this really far away
from camp?

202
00:12:58,009 --> 00:12:59,812
Yeah, it's about half way.

203
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:01,013
Yeah.

204
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:05,217
Nice.

205
00:13:16,961 --> 00:13:18,396
Welcome to Ragnarok.

206
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:22,134
Who is that?

207
00:13:27,304 --> 00:13:28,906
-By the way.
-Yeah?

208
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:31,543
No smoking. Fire danger.

209
00:13:31,576 --> 00:13:32,577
Okay.

210
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:34,513
I don't smoke.

211
00:13:43,621 --> 00:13:45,556
All right, some quick
housekeeping, brothers.

212
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,860
One,

213
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:50,963
lot of rattlesnakes,
especially up in that area,

214
00:13:50,995 --> 00:13:52,297
and that cave up there,

215
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:54,566
we had a collapse,
our boy Nicky, you know Nicky,

216
00:13:54,599 --> 00:13:56,435
he almost got crushed
up in there,

217
00:13:56,467 --> 00:13:58,135
so stay away from it.

218
00:13:58,168 --> 00:14:03,141
I wonder if I should get out...
of the car.

219
00:14:05,677 --> 00:14:09,615
Two, no booze
in the Triangle of Ragnarok,

220
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:11,649
and you will understand that
when you get in there.

221
00:14:11,682 --> 00:14:14,186
You can come drink
at your car, so...

222
00:14:18,155 --> 00:14:19,190
No, I think that's...
Yeah,

223
00:14:19,224 --> 00:14:20,926
leave all of your gear
in the car

224
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,627
and someone will come
and take care of it

225
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,896
and put it in your yurt for ya.

226
00:14:24,929 --> 00:14:26,865
Krunk, come on, we gotta go.
D. D. Mao!

227
00:14:31,702 --> 00:14:33,471
Where are you going?

228
00:14:33,504 --> 00:14:34,972
I got some stuff
I gotta do.

229
00:14:35,005 --> 00:14:36,408
All right. Okay.

230
00:14:36,441 --> 00:14:38,476
-See you guys down there.
-See you. See you, Nathaniel!

231
00:14:38,509 --> 00:14:39,610
I can't believe
I haven't been here yet.

232
00:14:39,644 --> 00:14:41,346
Yeah, it's crazy.

233
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:43,649
Wow.
Camera's out.

234
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:44,515
-Hey.
-He's Pitman.

235
00:14:44,549 --> 00:14:46,517
Holy shit.
Nice to meet you, man.

236
00:14:46,551 --> 00:14:48,020
-Nice to meet you.
-This is Roos.

237
00:14:48,052 --> 00:14:50,389
Hello, cameraman.

238
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:51,490
Wow, that's a trip.

239
00:14:59,029 --> 00:15:01,033
And we just got...

240
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,502
these, we had...

241
00:15:03,534 --> 00:15:04,702
some trouble
with our old structures,

242
00:15:04,735 --> 00:15:07,639
so we just got
some new structures, and...

243
00:15:07,672 --> 00:15:09,508
Working on 'em,
figuring 'em out.

244
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,276
Wow.

245
00:15:11,308 --> 00:15:13,110
That's pretty cool.

246
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,086
Creepy.

247
00:15:22,553 --> 00:15:24,122
That's creepy.

248
00:15:26,591 --> 00:15:29,061
That's a nice spot to die.

249
00:15:30,028 --> 00:15:33,031
Regretting coming here.

250
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:39,338
-You see the people up there, David?
... What?

251
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:40,972
People up there?

252
00:15:41,005 --> 00:15:42,341
-Whoa.
-David.

253
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:44,042
-God.
-David.

254
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,579
Welcome to Ragnarok.

255
00:15:48,645 --> 00:15:49,948
Wow.

256
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:01,326
Are you serious?

257
00:16:05,129 --> 00:16:06,731
-Hey!
-How's it going, man?

258
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:09,600
Come on, Pitty.

259
00:16:11,201 --> 00:16:13,538
-Don't be too weird.
-Keep up with us, man.

260
00:16:17,207 --> 00:16:19,211
Holy cow.

261
00:16:23,081 --> 00:16:25,484
Wow.
Good, man.

262
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:28,153
-Fuckin' nuts.
-Yeah.

263
00:16:28,186 --> 00:16:29,388
What's up?

264
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:30,756
-How are you?
-Welcome.

265
00:16:30,855 --> 00:16:32,189
Show you guys around
real quick,

266
00:16:32,222 --> 00:16:34,058
and then show you
where your stuff's at.

267
00:16:34,091 --> 00:16:35,626
We'll get you in your place
and then we will eat dinner.

268
00:16:35,659 --> 00:16:37,528
This is the whole crew?
This is everybody?

269
00:16:37,562 --> 00:16:39,031
-Yeah. I'm David.
-This is it!

270
00:16:39,063 --> 00:16:40,664
-Hi, hi!
-I'm Adam.

271
00:16:40,697 --> 00:16:42,667
-That's Sugar Slim.
-Adam.

272
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,801
-Adam, as well.
-This is Dave, this is John.

273
00:16:43,835 --> 00:16:46,738
-Adam.
-They call me Cotton. That's my last name.

274
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:49,173
-Cotton.
-Keep the confusion down.

275
00:16:49,206 --> 00:16:50,641
The cameras are on us.

276
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:55,246
Capturing every move.

277
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,280
How was the drive?

278
00:16:57,514 --> 00:16:59,683
-It was good.
-It was good. Hot.

279
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,789
Don't go
in Martha's kitchen.

280
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:09,161
You know, or rub my back
or my feet, or be dinner.

281
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:15,100
All right, she's cookin',
so we'll let her be.

282
00:17:15,133 --> 00:17:17,169
-How're you hangin' in there?
-I'm good. Yeah.

283
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:20,971
This is the water buffalo.

284
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:23,075
So you guys need to drink a lot
of water while you're here.

285
00:17:23,107 --> 00:17:24,742
-This is your kitchen?
-It is.

286
00:17:24,776 --> 00:17:27,479
There's a lot of stuff going
on, but it's a lot of fun.

287
00:17:28,613 --> 00:17:30,548
-What's your name?
-I'm Martha.

288
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:33,351
-Adam.
-Adam, nice to meet you.

289
00:17:33,384 --> 00:17:36,188
Kind of has a little bit
of a sulfur taste to it.

290
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:39,124
It's 'cause it's soft water. Tons of
minerals, really, really good for you.

291
00:17:39,156 --> 00:17:41,326
-Stoking!
-Thank you stoking!

292
00:17:41,358 --> 00:17:43,861
But it does smell
like fart water, so...

293
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,801
-These are beautiful.
-What's your name?

294
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:56,708
Put some racks in 'em,
cover 'em in mud,

295
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:57,808
and bake away.

296
00:18:01,846 --> 00:18:03,315
You guys like lasagna?

297
00:18:03,347 --> 00:18:05,817
Disproportion.
This one has...

298
00:18:05,849 --> 00:18:08,185
I just ran out of sauce
for the top of the...

299
00:18:11,689 --> 00:18:13,191
-I'm David.
-Hey, David.

300
00:18:13,223 --> 00:18:15,126
How ya doin', man?
Nice to meet ya. I'm Nick.

301
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,327
Nick. Nice to meet you, man.

302
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:17,528
-Gabriel?
-Yeah.

303
00:18:17,561 --> 00:18:19,497
-Nice to meet you.
-You too.

304
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:21,532
All right, well I think
that's it for these guys.

305
00:18:21,566 --> 00:18:23,735
David, there's prickly pear,

306
00:18:23,768 --> 00:18:26,137
so anything
inside the Triangle,

307
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:28,573
you'r pretty much safe,
you can kinda like...

308
00:18:28,605 --> 00:18:31,643
you know, step with
your flip-flops and stuff.

309
00:18:31,675 --> 00:18:33,912
Why do you call it
the Triangle?

310
00:18:33,944 --> 00:18:36,514
'cause it's
like a triangle.

311
00:18:37,548 --> 00:18:39,550
It's-it's like the shape
of the community.

312
00:18:39,584 --> 00:18:41,686
It's where everything fits.

313
00:18:41,719 --> 00:18:42,787
We're pretty tight knit,
you know,

314
00:18:42,819 --> 00:18:45,256
so it keeps everybody kind of
tight knit and cool.

315
00:18:45,289 --> 00:18:46,325
Yeah.

316
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:47,726
Wow.

317
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:49,461
Let me show you guys
to your yurt.

318
00:18:49,493 --> 00:18:50,528
-Wow.
-Yeah.

319
00:18:50,561 --> 00:18:51,729
We get a yurt?

320
00:18:51,762 --> 00:18:53,432
-Yeah.
-Holy shit.

321
00:18:54,731 --> 00:18:56,300
Whoa.

322
00:18:57,234 --> 00:18:58,469
So, man, this is all you guys.

323
00:18:58,502 --> 00:19:00,905
I am gonna go check on dinner,
see if I can help out and...

324
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:03,208
-Okay. Cool, cool.
-Make yourselves comfortable.

325
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,808
-There you go.
-Awesome, man.

326
00:19:04,842 --> 00:19:06,211
Thank you.

327
00:19:15,252 --> 00:19:17,888
-Stoking.
-Thank you stoking.

328
00:19:17,922 --> 00:19:18,923
-What's your name?
-Rick.

329
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:20,826
-Rick. Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

330
00:19:22,259 --> 00:19:25,262
How was the journey, man?
Welcome, welcome.

331
00:19:25,296 --> 00:19:26,965
What's for dinner?

332
00:19:26,998 --> 00:19:29,500
Lasagna and some salad.

333
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:33,638
I haven't met you yet.
What's your name?

334
00:19:33,671 --> 00:19:37,375
-I'm Ciara.
-Ciara? Hi.

335
00:19:41,011 --> 00:19:42,947
-What's your name, by the way?
-I'm David. Sorry.

336
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,817
-Very cool. I'm Reid.
-Reid? Nice to meet you, Reid.

337
00:19:45,849 --> 00:19:48,919
-Hi, I'm Sarina.
-Sarina. Nice to meet you.

338
00:19:48,952 --> 00:19:50,588
-Hailey.
-Hailey. Nice to meet you, Hailey.

339
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:51,957
Nice to meet you.

340
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,625
Hi, I'm David.

341
00:19:54,592 --> 00:19:55,994
Okay...

342
00:19:56,027 --> 00:19:58,230
Hey, Rizzo?
Sorry to interrupt.

343
00:19:58,262 --> 00:20:01,232
What's the protocol
for dinner?

344
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:02,467
-Hi, buddy.
-Protocol?

345
00:20:04,501 --> 00:20:05,570
Eat.

346
00:20:06,503 --> 00:20:08,906
How long do you plan
to be here?

347
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,976
I'm...
I'm not totally sure.

348
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:14,479
I think... two weeks,
three weeks maybe?

349
00:20:14,511 --> 00:20:17,215
Yeah... yeah.

350
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,919
What in the hell?

351
00:20:21,952 --> 00:20:24,455
I don't know, there is
something about electricity

352
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:27,592
and energy that I get, like,
it makes sense to me.

353
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:28,993
Do you feel like its ironic

354
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:30,429
that you are trying
to get away from it?

355
00:20:30,461 --> 00:20:33,999
The things that make us comfortable
sometimes make us too comfortable,

356
00:20:34,031 --> 00:20:37,335
and we start to forget
what else life is really about.

357
00:20:37,367 --> 00:20:38,970
-You know?
-Yeah.

358
00:20:39,002 --> 00:20:42,339
I found myself that way
years ago, and...

359
00:20:42,373 --> 00:20:44,576
you know the Burning Man
experience for me

360
00:20:44,608 --> 00:20:48,012
definitely opened my eyes to
alternative forms of living,

361
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:52,584
you know, and it's...
it's a treat honestly.

362
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:55,353
Whoa!

363
00:20:55,385 --> 00:20:57,021
That generator...

364
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:59,591
with a five gallon tank

365
00:20:59,624 --> 00:21:01,526
probably can run
about 12 hours.

366
00:21:01,558 --> 00:21:02,759
Okay.

367
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:04,829
But we are not big
into fossil fuels around here

368
00:21:04,862 --> 00:21:06,298
unless it's a special occasion.

369
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:09,000
And luckily
you're a special occasion!

370
00:21:09,032 --> 00:21:11,735
Cool! Thank you very much.

371
00:21:11,769 --> 00:21:13,003
No problem!

372
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:19,811
The idea that
there are scorpions,

373
00:21:19,844 --> 00:21:22,013
rattlesnakes...

374
00:21:22,046 --> 00:21:25,016
and like I said we're so far
out in the middle of nowhere.

375
00:21:25,048 --> 00:21:26,651
No cell phone service.

376
00:21:26,683 --> 00:21:28,485
That cell phone booster
does not work at all.

377
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:30,888
It says there are three bars
but it doesn't call out.

378
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:34,025
It doesn't connect.
I'm very uncomfortable.

379
00:21:34,057 --> 00:21:35,326
-I know you are.
-It's not...

380
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:39,830
But, hey, hey, hey, hey.
What if this is good for you?

381
00:21:39,864 --> 00:21:42,567
In what way?
Like a spiritual...

382
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:43,767
No, no, no, no, no.

383
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,337
I'm gonna have this thing
that pulls me out of, I mean...

384
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:48,440
-Out of your comfort zone.
-Sure, I understand that.

385
00:21:48,472 --> 00:21:50,709
What do I always say?
If you spend your life...

386
00:21:50,741 --> 00:21:53,377
being comfortable all the
time how do you ever grow?

387
00:21:53,411 --> 00:21:54,512
Right, I understand.

388
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:56,948
You've got some things
that you need to...

389
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:57,915
I saw somebody.

390
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:01,653
Somebody was at that window,
looking in the window.

391
00:22:04,454 --> 00:22:06,423
Somebody was looking
in the window.

392
00:22:06,457 --> 00:22:07,759
-Geez!
-Jesus Christ!

393
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:09,226
It was Nathaniel.

394
00:22:09,259 --> 00:22:11,730
I think you have some things
you need to work through.

395
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:15,799
My God. Jesus!

396
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:19,037
That scared the shit out of me.

397
00:22:20,438 --> 00:22:22,107
What ya doin' in here?

398
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,142
We're having a conversation.
That's all.

399
00:22:24,174 --> 00:22:26,610
-No, it's awesome.
-God.

400
00:22:26,644 --> 00:22:29,047
That really scared me.
Okay?

401
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:30,115
All right.

402
00:22:31,048 --> 00:22:33,884
Are you all right there, Pitty?

403
00:22:53,304 --> 00:22:55,707
Keeps coming up like
"What are you guys doing here?"

404
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,509
And it's like... what?!

405
00:22:57,541 --> 00:22:59,109
We came out here
'cause you asked us to.

406
00:22:59,143 --> 00:23:01,546
Because you invite us out here!
We were invited.

407
00:23:01,578 --> 00:23:04,115
And I actually only feel comfortable
enough talking about it

408
00:23:04,147 --> 00:23:06,417
'cause I don't think they can
hear us over the generator.

409
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:09,487
But I mean there were some...
There was a few moments where

410
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:11,522
we talked about
the people who...

411
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:14,025
the people who don't really
want us here.

412
00:23:14,057 --> 00:23:16,661
Not individually
and specific but...

413
00:23:16,693 --> 00:23:18,997
there is some people
who don't...

414
00:23:19,029 --> 00:23:21,432
It wasn't there choice
to bring us here.

415
00:23:21,465 --> 00:23:25,135
But, he talked
about you, Pitman,

416
00:23:25,169 --> 00:23:27,472
and the fact that, you know, you
didn't want to ride with him,

417
00:23:27,505 --> 00:23:29,207
and you know he kept saying,

418
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,142
"If your squirrelly friend
brings that into the Triangle

419
00:23:31,174 --> 00:23:34,778
they're gonna...
they're gonna pick up on it."

420
00:23:34,811 --> 00:23:36,414
Weird.

421
00:23:37,481 --> 00:23:38,716
Does that bother you?

422
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,185
I mean, I wasn't actually even
gonna mention it to you at all.

423
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:42,888
Shh, shh, shh!

424
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:49,461
Cotton!

425
00:23:49,493 --> 00:23:50,928
-Can I come in?
-Yeah.me.

426
00:23:50,961 --> 00:23:52,364
You scared me.

427
00:23:52,396 --> 00:23:55,532
And my tru... Why do I have this
trust issue with Nathaniel?

428
00:23:55,566 --> 00:23:56,400
Yeah, he's one of
your best friends!

429
00:23:56,433 --> 00:23:57,935
We just gotta talk to him.

430
00:23:57,969 --> 00:23:59,203
Whenever I see him
he looks pissed off.

431
00:23:59,237 --> 00:24:02,173
He looks like he has the weight
of the world on his shoulders.

432
00:24:02,205 --> 00:24:04,074
Yeah, and he said, "We..."

433
00:24:04,107 --> 00:24:06,176
It's a big deal, like,
we got a subject for a..."

434
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:08,212
Maybe that's it.
Maybe we need to...

435
00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:11,016
We need to talk
to those fuckin' motherfuckers.

436
00:24:14,585 --> 00:24:15,886
-I just love it in here.
-Yeah.

437
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,855
Wow.

438
00:24:16,887 --> 00:24:18,522
-The yurts are new for us.
-Okay.

439
00:24:18,556 --> 00:24:20,225
Yeah, they're a new...
We're trying them out.

440
00:24:20,258 --> 00:24:23,094
We had a little
surplus money and...

441
00:24:23,126 --> 00:24:25,562
You said usually you guys are
doing kinda the bigger tents.

442
00:24:25,596 --> 00:24:28,566
Yeah, we did those canvas tents
and,

443
00:24:28,598 --> 00:24:30,902
you know, even though they're
shady they get pretty hot.

444
00:24:30,934 --> 00:24:33,504
So, are you okay?

445
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:35,240
-Yeah, yeah.
-You good?

446
00:24:35,272 --> 00:24:37,241
Yeah, I'm good, man.
I'm-I'm good.

447
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:39,210
You're stressed a little bit?

448
00:24:39,242 --> 00:24:41,612
You know, and I don't... You
know, we invited you guys here,

449
00:24:41,645 --> 00:24:44,548
and I don't want to put
any of this on you, but...

450
00:24:44,582 --> 00:24:46,117
you guys have to understand

451
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:49,287
that you're walking
into a situation where...

452
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:51,121
these people
have built this place,

453
00:24:51,154 --> 00:24:52,624
and they put it together,

454
00:24:52,656 --> 00:24:54,525
and they made a lot
of personal sacrifices

455
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:56,894
and financial sacrifices
to be here,

456
00:24:56,928 --> 00:25:00,198
and, it can pose a little bit
of a threat,

457
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:02,799
and they're concerned about
how they're gonna be portrayed.

458
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:05,269
-Yeah.
-But we've got a good thing going on here,

459
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:08,673
and we want people to know
that this is possible,

460
00:25:08,705 --> 00:25:11,275
that you can do this
and you can find happiness.

461
00:25:11,308 --> 00:25:14,144
-In an environment where...
... That's why you asked us to come?

462
00:25:14,178 --> 00:25:15,747
Or...

463
00:25:15,779 --> 00:25:18,016
Well, I need you guys
to know that...

464
00:25:18,048 --> 00:25:19,250
there is some stuff going on

465
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:22,120
that I am not really at liberty
to talk discuss right now...

466
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:23,221
-Great.
-Within the group.

467
00:25:23,253 --> 00:25:26,623
And just know that things are
gonna level off...

468
00:25:26,656 --> 00:25:29,226
It's an adjustment for you guys
to land here,

469
00:25:29,259 --> 00:25:31,663
and it's an adjustment
for us to have you.

470
00:25:31,695 --> 00:25:32,829
That makes sense.
Cool.

471
00:25:36,866 --> 00:25:38,302
Where are we goin'?

472
00:25:39,236 --> 00:25:41,605
Straight to the top, baby!

473
00:25:42,306 --> 00:25:43,942
That's beautiful.

474
00:25:54,117 --> 00:25:55,653
Why are you here?

475
00:25:56,988 --> 00:26:00,825
I'm here
because of these people...

476
00:26:00,857 --> 00:26:05,596
and I am here
to experience...

477
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:10,034
and create a culture
in a setting of our choosing.

478
00:26:10,067 --> 00:26:13,671
When you get all
the outside noise, you know...

479
00:26:13,703 --> 00:26:15,339
dimmed down, quieted down,
you know,

480
00:26:15,373 --> 00:26:17,141
you can do the best writing,
do the best singing,

481
00:26:17,173 --> 00:26:19,644
you can do the best dancing,
like just feel free.

482
00:26:19,676 --> 00:26:22,179
The ability to make change
in this environment

483
00:26:22,212 --> 00:26:26,951
is so immediate,
and so powerful, and...

484
00:26:26,983 --> 00:26:30,020
the struggles that we go
through, we go through together.

485
00:26:30,054 --> 00:26:33,157
This is a place to be...

486
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:37,695
aware of yourself,
and connect with other people,

487
00:26:37,728 --> 00:26:39,230
<i>truly and honestly,</i>

488
00:26:39,262 --> 00:26:42,066
<i>and be open enough
with yourself to...</i>

489
00:26:42,098 --> 00:26:44,201
connect with
other open souls.

490
00:26:44,234 --> 00:26:45,669
So I am very out front,

491
00:26:45,702 --> 00:26:47,372
like I enjoy bathing
in front of people,

492
00:26:47,404 --> 00:26:51,908
and I think that's kind of one of
the beauties of our community.

493
00:26:51,942 --> 00:26:53,711
<i>And just shows, sort of,</i>

494
00:26:53,743 --> 00:26:55,846
<i>you know, an extreme level
of intimacy</i>

495
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,115
<i>that we somehow managed
to achieve</i>

496
00:26:57,147 --> 00:26:59,850
<i>for a fairly decent sized group
is bathing out in the open.</i>

497
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:02,153
<i>I mean, you can see people
shitting up on the hill up there.</i>

498
00:27:02,185 --> 00:27:05,722
<i>It's all... But it's all like,
why should it be shameful?</i>

499
00:27:05,756 --> 00:27:07,358
<i>Why should it be? It's like
it's all something we all do,</i>

500
00:27:07,391 --> 00:27:09,360
<i>we all have to deal
with our bodies, like...</i>

501
00:27:09,393 --> 00:27:11,129
<i>-We're all animals.
-Yeah, exactly!</i>

502
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:12,363
And attaching
this notion of shame,

503
00:27:12,396 --> 00:27:15,832
it seems like a very sort of
Catholic, Protestant sort of,

504
00:27:15,865 --> 00:27:17,902
you know, way of living that I,

505
00:27:17,934 --> 00:27:21,038
you know, so-so desperately
been trying to avoid

506
00:27:21,071 --> 00:27:22,439
ever since
I have been old enough

507
00:27:22,472 --> 00:27:24,174
to make my own decisions.

508
00:27:28,345 --> 00:27:30,015
What's in here?

509
00:27:32,415 --> 00:27:35,052
Please don't film in here.

510
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:36,753
Just...

511
00:27:36,787 --> 00:27:38,423
Okay. Sorry.

512
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:42,393
When an emotion rises up,
like, I don't like

513
00:27:42,425 --> 00:27:44,761
the way that David's
asking me this question,

514
00:27:44,795 --> 00:27:47,932
I have a choice to try that on
and take over my vessel.

515
00:27:47,964 --> 00:27:49,800
It's almost like a fight.

516
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:52,937
Within a fight you've got two
things that you are in control of,

517
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:54,072
time and distance.

518
00:27:54,105 --> 00:27:55,173
The distance
you've got to cover,

519
00:27:55,205 --> 00:27:57,074
and the time it takes
to get there and strike it.

520
00:27:57,107 --> 00:27:58,775
-You know what I mean?
-Sure...

521
00:27:58,808 --> 00:28:00,877
So when a thought or emotion
comes up

522
00:28:00,911 --> 00:28:04,981
for me five years ago I would
be like "David hates me!"

523
00:28:05,015 --> 00:28:07,451
and I would be like, you know,
fuckin' I gotta clock this guy.

524
00:28:07,484 --> 00:28:10,020
You know? And I would be talking
to you, going "fuck you."

525
00:28:10,054 --> 00:28:12,724
And now I allow, I go,
"David hates me." I look at it,

526
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:15,993
kinda separate it, I get a little time and
distance in between me and that thought

527
00:28:16,026 --> 00:28:19,297
before I let it
take over my flesh suit.

528
00:28:19,329 --> 00:28:21,164
I watch it,

529
00:28:21,198 --> 00:28:23,501
and then I have an appropriate
amount of distance

530
00:28:23,534 --> 00:28:25,436
to say "is that something
I really want to try on?"

531
00:28:25,469 --> 00:28:27,337
Is that something I really
want to give to David?"

532
00:28:27,371 --> 00:28:30,041
Because to be quite...
quite frankly, I do.

533
00:28:30,074 --> 00:28:33,211
-I am disliking the way you are asking me these questions!
... Sorry!

534
00:28:38,848 --> 00:28:40,751
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

535
00:28:40,785 --> 00:28:42,420
-What was your name again?
-I'm Ciara.

536
00:28:42,452 --> 00:28:44,821
Ciara. David.

537
00:28:44,855 --> 00:28:46,390
How are you ladies
feeling today?

538
00:28:46,423 --> 00:28:48,526
Kind of stuffed up.

539
00:28:48,558 --> 00:28:50,795
-Yeah?
-Are you getting that too, a little bit?

540
00:28:50,827 --> 00:28:52,497
Just, I don't know if
it's the dryness or...

541
00:28:56,834 --> 00:29:00,037
The heat. The heat
and the desert dryness.

542
00:29:01,971 --> 00:29:04,808
Yeah, I think I need to lay
down, my head is kind of...

543
00:29:04,842 --> 00:29:06,811
Lay down, baby.

544
00:29:17,387 --> 00:29:19,523
I was walking around
in my bare feet,

545
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:22,160
and got a prickly pear.

546
00:29:22,192 --> 00:29:23,994
I stepped on one...

547
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:26,530
and I got all these little
thorns in my foot.

548
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:27,765
And they're like,
"We're rakin'!"

549
00:29:27,798 --> 00:29:30,334
I was like "You don't have to
rake, I'll put on my shoes."

550
00:29:30,366 --> 00:29:32,002
<i>"Nope, we're gonna rake
this whole place."</i>

551
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:36,140
<i>I was like "No! Seriously,
don't rake. It's fine."</i>

552
00:29:36,173 --> 00:29:38,075
<i>He's like
"No, you're our guest."</i>

553
00:29:38,107 --> 00:29:40,477
<i>Rick said, "If you have
a thorn in your foot,</i>

554
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:42,579
<i>we have a thorn in our foot.</i>

555
00:29:42,613 --> 00:29:43,914
"We're gonna rake
this whole place."

556
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:46,350
And they've been raking
all day.

557
00:29:46,383 --> 00:29:49,120
It's all because somebody gets a
little prickly pear on their toe.

558
00:29:49,153 --> 00:29:51,389
Next thing you know
you're rakin' all day.

559
00:30:01,932 --> 00:30:04,602
This is a...
appearance release.

560
00:30:04,634 --> 00:30:06,369
I thought this was
a handshake sort of a deal.

561
00:30:06,403 --> 00:30:08,538
We can't
when it's a production...

562
00:30:20,049 --> 00:30:21,184
Should I go talk to him?

563
00:30:21,218 --> 00:30:22,486
Yeah.

564
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:23,887
Hey, R...

565
00:30:29,593 --> 00:30:30,794
What do we do?

566
00:30:30,827 --> 00:30:31,995
-It's just one of those things.
-I get it.

567
00:30:32,028 --> 00:30:32,896
We still have to deal
with the real world

568
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:35,466
and I am not trying
to be an asshole.

569
00:30:35,499 --> 00:30:37,201
-Bring that stuff to me first...
-Yeah, yeah. Okay.

570
00:30:37,233 --> 00:30:39,069
-Before he brings it to...
-Yeah, absolutely.

571
00:30:39,103 --> 00:30:40,371
Absolutely. Yeah.

572
00:30:40,403 --> 00:30:42,339
We want this movie
to be in theaters.

573
00:30:42,373 --> 00:30:43,607
Of course, but hey, hey, hey.

574
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:46,043
But hey, keep your dicky...
keep your dicky...

575
00:30:46,076 --> 00:30:48,945
keep your dicky in your pants
and we can fuck next week.

576
00:30:48,979 --> 00:30:51,649
We invited you, we did.
We asked you to do that but...

577
00:30:51,682 --> 00:30:54,184
The thing is, that we do need
every single person here

578
00:30:54,218 --> 00:30:56,387
to sign these agreements.

579
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,587
That'll happen...

580
00:30:57,621 --> 00:30:59,390
'cause it could be
just a film

581
00:30:59,423 --> 00:31:02,226
about 20 jerk-offs
in the middle of nowhere,

582
00:31:02,259 --> 00:31:03,661
but if you're kind to us,

583
00:31:03,693 --> 00:31:06,297
there's things that we
understand and we know...

584
00:31:06,329 --> 00:31:09,432
that can really...
be mutually beneficial.

585
00:31:09,465 --> 00:31:11,902
Do you, want these?
Do you want to read 'em over?

586
00:31:11,935 --> 00:31:13,971
Yeah.
Listen, I know what this is.

587
00:31:14,003 --> 00:31:15,372
Put 'em by the toilets.

588
00:31:16,973 --> 00:31:18,375
That's how we feel
about it too, man.

589
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:20,912
You know that.
We hate this shit.

590
00:31:20,944 --> 00:31:22,946
-It's a lot of paperwork.
-I mean, some people don't...

591
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,248
-It's just reality, and...
-Listen.

592
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,650
Some people don't even
have addresses.

593
00:31:26,683 --> 00:31:28,451
Where ya gonna put
the address on here?

594
00:31:28,484 --> 00:31:29,252
We don't need...

595
00:31:29,286 --> 00:31:30,922
What address,
a grid coordinate?

596
00:31:30,954 --> 00:31:31,989
Put the signature on there

597
00:31:32,021 --> 00:31:33,290
and you guys
can figure out the rest.

598
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:34,525
Yeah, and it doesn't
say anything

599
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:38,461
except that you aren't gonna
sue us, and I doubt you will.

600
00:31:38,494 --> 00:31:40,497
No we'll kill ya
before we sue ya.

601
00:31:45,702 --> 00:31:47,404
All right. All right.

602
00:31:47,438 --> 00:31:50,207
If we can help with anything,
I know we're trying to...

603
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,575
You know, I don't know...

604
00:31:51,607 --> 00:31:53,576
Put this douche on a leash.

605
00:31:53,609 --> 00:31:57,147
I'm just kiddin', I like ya,
I do, I really do.

606
00:31:57,181 --> 00:32:00,017
He's like that.
He makes jokes.

607
00:32:00,049 --> 00:32:01,284
He does.

608
00:32:01,317 --> 00:32:03,554
So wait what happened? You
just like brought them out...

609
00:32:03,586 --> 00:32:05,189
I wasn't around when...

610
00:32:05,221 --> 00:32:06,490
Forget it. Fuck it.

611
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:13,264
Ho!

612
00:32:13,297 --> 00:32:15,399
-Armpit.
-Armpit.

613
00:32:15,432 --> 00:32:17,201
You sliced his femoral artery.

614
00:32:22,573 --> 00:32:23,407
Good job.

615
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,709
Deadman!

616
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:28,412
-Deadman.
-Splittin' wigs.

617
00:32:28,444 --> 00:32:30,213
Hey, where's that Pit-man guy?

618
00:32:34,151 --> 00:32:35,753
Yeah, yeah, I'm all right.

619
00:32:36,753 --> 00:32:38,555
No, sit down.
Sit down.

620
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:42,092
Does it feel like
there is something in there

621
00:32:42,125 --> 00:32:44,028
or is it just a pressure?

622
00:32:49,098 --> 00:32:50,233
-Hey Pitman.
-Yeah?

623
00:32:50,267 --> 00:32:52,303
Sorry sorry, cut it please.

624
00:32:52,336 --> 00:32:56,007
We usually do a good breakfast
and then a snack,

625
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:58,709
because it's so hot out here
that you don't really wanna

626
00:32:58,741 --> 00:33:00,744
eat that much
in the middle of the day.

627
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:03,480
And then at night we...
I try to feast,

628
00:33:03,513 --> 00:33:05,615
'cause everybody works so hard
out here.

629
00:33:05,648 --> 00:33:08,084
<i>Ya know, there's just always
things to do,</i>

630
00:33:08,117 --> 00:33:13,256
<i>always things to do, always
things to fix or create, or...</i>

631
00:33:13,289 --> 00:33:16,460
<i>ya know... and it gets
hot and heavy.</i>

632
00:33:16,492 --> 00:33:19,364
There is
an interconnectedness...

633
00:33:20,463 --> 00:33:21,765
<i>that's very real.</i>

634
00:33:21,798 --> 00:33:24,100
<i>You know, living out
in the wilderness</i>

635
00:33:24,134 --> 00:33:25,702
<i>you see the ants move around.</i>

636
00:33:25,736 --> 00:33:27,805
<i>You see the way that they're
communicating constantly</i>

637
00:33:27,837 --> 00:33:28,739
<i>and they are feeding
off of each other,</i>

638
00:33:28,772 --> 00:33:30,740
<i>and we are feeding
off of each other.</i>

639
00:33:30,773 --> 00:33:34,277
<i>So we work...</i>

640
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:36,146
<i>very hard
to keep that in mind</i>

641
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,416
<i>and so every action
that I do</i>

642
00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:41,752
is going to affect
everyone around me.

643
00:33:41,785 --> 00:33:43,788
On small levels

644
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:46,790
we are all a part of making
this massive thing move,

645
00:33:46,824 --> 00:33:51,295
and if the gears aren't, 
taken care of individually

646
00:33:51,327 --> 00:33:53,364
it doesn't...
it doesn't go anywhere.

647
00:33:54,798 --> 00:33:56,800
Trying to do it
off the grid is...

648
00:33:58,268 --> 00:33:59,836
not the easiest.

649
00:33:59,869 --> 00:34:02,572
Definitely gives you
an appreciation for our...

650
00:34:02,605 --> 00:34:04,607
fore-fathers who came
out here with nothing,

651
00:34:04,641 --> 00:34:06,644
no gennies, no electricity,

652
00:34:06,676 --> 00:34:08,746
no plastic
to cover their shitters.

653
00:34:16,853 --> 00:34:18,288
You need water?

654
00:34:26,329 --> 00:34:28,465
-Are you ready to do this?
-Yeah, yeah, sorry.

655
00:34:34,771 --> 00:34:37,408
It's a place
to regain your perspective,

656
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,442
a place to touchstone on,
to come back

657
00:34:39,476 --> 00:34:41,311
and relearn how to...

658
00:34:41,344 --> 00:34:42,846
<i>The basic,
needs in life,</i>

659
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,381
<i>to learn how to
cook your food,</i>

660
00:34:44,414 --> 00:34:45,749
<i>to learn how to survive
in the elements,</i>

661
00:34:45,782 --> 00:34:47,852
<i>no distractions,
no advertising,</i>

662
00:34:47,885 --> 00:34:50,121
people not advertising
to each other

663
00:34:50,153 --> 00:34:52,188
about things
that are meaningless

664
00:34:52,222 --> 00:34:53,490
to your personal evolution.

665
00:34:53,523 --> 00:34:55,692
Not saying that
the world outside is...

666
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:57,327
meaningless to
personal evolution,

667
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:00,196
I think it's a big lesson
in what not to do.

668
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:02,733
Like the American culture,
Western civilization which is,

669
00:35:02,766 --> 00:35:04,367
ya know, in my estimation,

670
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,303
has just sort of poisoned
the entire world.

671
00:35:07,336 --> 00:35:10,541
Is... It's just all
so much horseshit.

672
00:35:10,574 --> 00:35:13,677
Like, you know,
New York is such...

673
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,778
is the epicenter of it,
of all the advertising,

674
00:35:15,811 --> 00:35:17,047
of all the...

675
00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:19,884
It feels like you are in there
and you are a fucking lab rat.

676
00:35:19,916 --> 00:35:22,418
And everybody there is having
all these social experiments

677
00:35:22,452 --> 00:35:24,288
and advertising experiments.

678
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,723
Test it out on them,
police presence at every turn,

679
00:35:26,757 --> 00:35:27,925
constantly...

680
00:35:27,958 --> 00:35:29,927
you know constantly having to
watch what you are doing,

681
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:34,197
and an arrogance to it,
like a belief that...

682
00:35:34,231 --> 00:35:37,902
a belief that somehow it's
the pinnacle of civilization,

683
00:35:37,934 --> 00:35:39,402
it's the pinnacle of progress,

684
00:35:39,436 --> 00:35:40,871
and it will always
be like this,

685
00:35:40,903 --> 00:35:43,239
but you take a step
away from it,

686
00:35:43,273 --> 00:35:44,508
and you come out
to a place like this

687
00:35:44,541 --> 00:35:47,678
and you walk through a a canyon
and you look at a mountain...

688
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:51,281
and you realize that the
land doesn't give a flying fuck

689
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:54,284
what we call important.

690
00:35:58,722 --> 00:36:00,224
What we, ya know,

691
00:36:00,257 --> 00:36:02,259
we have been going
to the burn together for years,

692
00:36:02,291 --> 00:36:04,261
and this was just kind of
the next step, you know?

693
00:36:05,795 --> 00:36:11,234
It's now been like three years,
I guess.

694
00:36:11,268 --> 00:36:13,938
Losing track of time, 'cause I
rarely even know what day it is.

695
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:15,940
Now we are in this space

696
00:36:15,972 --> 00:36:17,840
and time
just kind of goes through us.

697
00:36:17,873 --> 00:36:20,644
You know?
So...

698
00:36:21,945 --> 00:36:24,248
-You know what I mean?
... Yeah, absolutely.

699
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,748
What was the question?
Sorry.

700
00:36:28,318 --> 00:36:30,853
It's... I'm sorry. I think I need
to move out of the sun a little

701
00:36:30,887 --> 00:36:32,856
-because I'm getting kind of...
-Okay.

702
00:36:32,889 --> 00:36:34,557
Let me move my...

703
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:36,793
I'm sorry,
I'm getting a lot of...

704
00:36:36,827 --> 00:36:40,664
-feedback right now and it's a little overwhelming.
-Yeah... yeah. Okay.

705
00:36:40,697 --> 00:36:42,733
Yeah, thank you.
It's-it's okay.

706
00:36:42,766 --> 00:36:43,867
Yeah, I just... I gotta go.

707
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,101
I'm sorry,
I don't know if it's the...

708
00:36:45,135 --> 00:36:47,504
I think it might be the ca...
I think I'm a little sensitive,

709
00:36:47,536 --> 00:36:49,539
-and I didn't really shield today and I'm little...
... No worries.

710
00:36:49,572 --> 00:36:51,241
<i>So we sell the chimes.</i>

711
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:53,244
<i>We sell petrified wood mostly.</i>

712
00:36:53,277 --> 00:36:54,412
<i>We also do sage bundles,</i>

713
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:57,014
<i>'cause there is really great
burning sage out here.</i>

714
00:36:57,047 --> 00:36:58,715
And if you've noticed,

715
00:36:58,748 --> 00:37:00,683
I don't know
if you've looked around.

716
00:37:00,717 --> 00:37:04,521
There's a lot of cows
in the pastures,

717
00:37:04,554 --> 00:37:08,291
and when the cows take shits,

718
00:37:08,324 --> 00:37:11,494
there is a special little thing
that grows on them shits,

719
00:37:11,527 --> 00:37:15,665
and we kinda dry up the things
that grow on them shits

720
00:37:15,699 --> 00:37:16,901
and sell 'em.

721
00:37:23,539 --> 00:37:24,875
Wow!

722
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:30,514
Joe here is an Akbash,

723
00:37:30,547 --> 00:37:34,284
and he is really, really thick
fur coated in the wintertime

724
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:38,022
so when it gets cold
he has no problems

725
00:37:38,054 --> 00:37:39,989
staying out all year long
with the sheep.

726
00:37:40,023 --> 00:37:41,492
So they just ward off...

727
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:43,327
They ward off coyotes,
any predators.

728
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,329
They ward off coyotes, yeah.

729
00:37:45,362 --> 00:37:47,697
Mainly coyotes out here.

730
00:37:47,731 --> 00:37:49,734
No problems with them at all.

731
00:37:51,601 --> 00:37:52,903
It generates revenue.

732
00:37:52,936 --> 00:37:54,038
It gives a lot of people
something to do,

733
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:55,605
caring for the animals.

734
00:37:57,007 --> 00:38:00,077
You know, eventually we want to
learn how to make our own clothes,

735
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:01,644
I mean, and this is
the beginning step to that.

736
00:38:01,677 --> 00:38:05,016
It's a work in progress
and here we are, ya know.

737
00:38:13,123 --> 00:38:15,925
At the bare minimum, ya know,
I think we could...

738
00:38:15,958 --> 00:38:18,027
make a...

739
00:38:18,061 --> 00:38:20,030
documentary about...

740
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:22,900
a different way
of doing things,

741
00:38:22,932 --> 00:38:25,001
and showing people that...

742
00:38:26,436 --> 00:38:28,706
<i>this energy can be
brought back into communities.</i>

743
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:30,740
<i>Whatever that...
whatever that means.</i>

744
00:38:30,773 --> 00:38:33,076
<i>But just knowing that
there are other ways</i>

745
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:35,079
<i>and there are other options.</i>

746
00:38:35,112 --> 00:38:37,014
<i>It's something
that is very real.</i>

747
00:38:37,047 --> 00:38:40,550
<i>And It's something accessible
to us if we choose it.</i>

748
00:38:40,583 --> 00:38:42,786
<i>And that everything
that we do is...</i>

749
00:38:42,818 --> 00:38:44,822
<i>ultimately as we know...</i>

750
00:38:44,855 --> 00:38:46,690
<i>by our own design.</i>

751
00:38:46,722 --> 00:38:49,425
<i>And this is what
we have chosen to design.</i>

752
00:38:49,458 --> 00:38:52,028
If we form a relationship
and you wanna stay,

753
00:38:52,061 --> 00:38:55,598
if you form a relationship
and you like this place...

754
00:38:55,632 --> 00:38:57,367
then I'm happy, ya know?

755
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,902
If you come out here and...

756
00:38:59,936 --> 00:39:01,872
you demonize it,
if you don't enjoy it,

757
00:39:01,905 --> 00:39:05,075
if you think that something's
wrong with this kind of thing,

758
00:39:05,108 --> 00:39:07,010
then I'm okay with it.

759
00:39:09,179 --> 00:39:10,780
But the most important thing
for me

760
00:39:10,813 --> 00:39:13,049
is to give people
the opportunity

761
00:39:13,083 --> 00:39:15,385
to make up their own mind
about it.

762
00:39:19,588 --> 00:39:21,858
I don't want to come at
you guys like a hard on,

763
00:39:21,891 --> 00:39:24,427
but it's very important
to understand

764
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:26,096
that if this door blows open
and comes off,

765
00:39:26,128 --> 00:39:28,598
this thing turns
into a fuckin' kite.

766
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:32,001
You got to really make sure that
you keep it shut at all times,

767
00:39:32,034 --> 00:39:34,871
and if the door starts to come off
you got to re-tape it yourself.

768
00:39:34,905 --> 00:39:36,473
-Okay.
-Okay?

769
00:39:36,505 --> 00:39:37,840
-Sorry about...
-It's important.

770
00:39:37,873 --> 00:39:39,976
-Okay.
-It's important.

771
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:42,179
It's important.
Thank you.

772
00:39:42,211 --> 00:39:43,679
Sorry. Sorry.

773
00:39:43,713 --> 00:39:46,115
My beard's growing out,
my hair is growing out.

774
00:39:46,148 --> 00:39:48,719
-Haven't shaved.
... Yeah, that hair is...

775
00:39:48,751 --> 00:39:51,188
That hair
is really cuttin' loose.

776
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:55,658
You might be leavin' me behind.

777
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:02,699
Where are we goin'?

778
00:40:02,731 --> 00:40:06,436
We are going
to the Ragnarok well.

779
00:40:06,469 --> 00:40:07,837
Here we go.

780
00:40:15,478 --> 00:40:16,579
I think that some people
are a little threatened

781
00:40:16,612 --> 00:40:17,647
that you guys are out here.

782
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:19,182
Just 'cause it's...

783
00:40:19,215 --> 00:40:20,817
I mean you got a camera,
you know.

784
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:22,052
Usually everything
we say and do

785
00:40:22,085 --> 00:40:24,521
just kind of drifts off
into the ether.

786
00:40:24,554 --> 00:40:27,490
Ya know, and here you guys are
kind of recording everything.

787
00:40:35,965 --> 00:40:37,500
-Yeah. Awesome.
-Is that good?

788
00:40:37,534 --> 00:40:39,169
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

789
00:40:39,202 --> 00:40:40,504
Wha...?

790
00:40:40,536 --> 00:40:43,473
I'm just kidding.

791
00:40:45,742 --> 00:40:46,944
-All right, you're good to go.
-Good?

792
00:40:46,976 --> 00:40:48,211
Yeah.

793
00:40:54,818 --> 00:40:57,955
The word "cult."
I mean...

794
00:40:57,987 --> 00:40:59,923
Yeah give it a name.

795
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:01,625
We are...

796
00:41:01,657 --> 00:41:04,894
according to the predominant,
you know, paradigm

797
00:41:04,927 --> 00:41:07,830
of what a cult looks like
and what a cult is.

798
00:41:07,864 --> 00:41:10,166
It's the cage of words.

799
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:12,602
Ya know, you can wrap
this place in a cage of words

800
00:41:12,635 --> 00:41:14,704
and try to intellectualize it
and understand it,

801
00:41:14,737 --> 00:41:17,073
but it's just an Alamo.
It's to retouch...

802
00:41:17,106 --> 00:41:18,708
the human heart in a new,
different way.

803
00:41:18,742 --> 00:41:20,777
Not even a new way, to revisit

804
00:41:20,809 --> 00:41:24,213
a way that has been lost
in our contemporary society.

805
00:41:24,246 --> 00:41:26,250
A cult seems to signify to me,

806
00:41:26,282 --> 00:41:28,684
a unified belief system.

807
00:41:28,717 --> 00:41:32,688
Which means, a belief
is attaching to something...

808
00:41:32,722 --> 00:41:35,726
that you have the answer
to the unknown.

809
00:41:35,759 --> 00:41:37,561
And...

810
00:41:38,594 --> 00:41:40,730
one thing
we definitely don't have is...

811
00:41:40,764 --> 00:41:43,599
is, an answer
to the unknown.

812
00:41:43,632 --> 00:41:46,236
Roos just passed out
out here.

813
00:41:48,338 --> 00:41:50,707
Stilly, what's up, man?
What's goin' on?

814
00:41:50,739 --> 00:41:52,108
How you doin'?

815
00:41:52,141 --> 00:41:53,643
I think it's the headaches.

816
00:41:55,311 --> 00:41:56,846
Yeah?
You okay?

817
00:41:58,148 --> 00:41:59,682
Would you turn that camera off?
Why didn't you help him?

818
00:42:01,617 --> 00:42:03,520
Hey, you guys?

819
00:42:05,322 --> 00:42:08,291
Roos just...

820
00:42:08,324 --> 00:42:10,226
Shit.

821
00:42:12,161 --> 00:42:13,297
We need some shade.

822
00:42:14,764 --> 00:42:17,001
Can you, like, stand back?

823
00:42:20,603 --> 00:42:22,138
Pitman, get the camera off.

824
00:42:22,172 --> 00:42:24,340
I didn't...
I didn't even know.

825
00:42:24,373 --> 00:42:26,009
I was-I was, like, in shock.

826
00:42:26,041 --> 00:42:27,643
I didn't even know
I was filming it.

827
00:42:27,677 --> 00:42:29,680
No, it's not your fault.

828
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:31,348
They brought us in here.

829
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:34,250
We got the cameras, we're supposed
to be shooting all the time.

830
00:42:34,284 --> 00:42:35,452
Like, what are we
supposed to do?

831
00:42:35,485 --> 00:42:38,622
Let's be respectful, though,
when they say "cameras off."

832
00:42:38,655 --> 00:42:40,324
I mean, I know we're supposed
to be capturing al the dramas,

833
00:42:40,356 --> 00:42:43,125
you know, but I...
I don't want to...

834
00:42:43,159 --> 00:42:45,362
ruin relationships
around here. I wanna...

835
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:50,267
I think Pitman's
had his camera on 24/7.

836
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:52,369
I don't think he...
Its like a thing,

837
00:42:52,402 --> 00:42:54,804
when you get it in your head
you just have it on...

838
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:56,640
I will say sorry.

839
00:42:56,672 --> 00:42:58,641
Like, he's really scared
of things like that

840
00:42:58,675 --> 00:43:01,678
and he was shocked
and I don't know if he knew.

841
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:03,145
You know what I mean?
I really...

842
00:43:03,179 --> 00:43:04,314
Something's happening out here.

843
00:43:04,347 --> 00:43:06,717
When you're a member
of this community...

844
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,851
you are officially a part
of the we collective.

845
00:43:08,885 --> 00:43:11,088
-Right.
-We take care of each other here.

846
00:43:15,125 --> 00:43:17,728
I'm okay. It's just...

847
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,197
livin' on the fucking
prairie, you know.

848
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:21,398
-Just normal stuff.
-All right.

849
00:43:21,431 --> 00:43:22,833
Good. Okay.

850
00:43:22,865 --> 00:43:24,701
Can you-can we just
have this conversation

851
00:43:24,733 --> 00:43:26,335
without the camera
for a couple of minutes?

852
00:43:26,369 --> 00:43:29,972
I'm a little concerned
about, Rooster.

853
00:43:30,005 --> 00:43:32,808
This Morning the same thing
happened to Ricky.

854
00:43:32,842 --> 00:43:33,943
Shit.

855
00:43:33,976 --> 00:43:36,379
I mean he, collapsed,
he got up and was fine, but...

856
00:43:36,413 --> 00:43:39,016
Did you ask him, like,
if that's, like,

857
00:43:39,048 --> 00:43:40,751
what it was,
or if it was just...

858
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:44,253
No, he said it's so hot.
It was the heat.

859
00:43:48,391 --> 00:43:49,659
<i>You know, and how global warming</i>

860
00:43:49,693 --> 00:43:50,728
<i>is going to affect us.</i>

861
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,728
<i>And, you know,
scientists don't really know.</i>

862
00:43:52,762 --> 00:43:53,863
<i>So, who knows?</i>

863
00:43:53,896 --> 00:43:56,732
<i>Next year we might not even
see a drop of rain.</i>

864
00:43:56,766 --> 00:44:00,436
This broccoli is really
confused by the weather.

865
00:44:00,469 --> 00:44:02,405
Right here this
is about to flower so...

866
00:44:02,438 --> 00:44:04,907
it's flowering
and its not ready.

867
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:07,209
So it's in this weird
limbo state

868
00:44:07,242 --> 00:44:10,079
that a lot of these plants
seem to be in.

869
00:44:14,184 --> 00:44:15,318
I just want to ask you
real quick,

870
00:44:15,351 --> 00:44:16,753
there's been a couple, like,

871
00:44:16,786 --> 00:44:19,722
people passing out lately,
you know?

872
00:44:19,755 --> 00:44:21,057
I think it's just the heat.

873
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:22,425
Yeah.

874
00:44:22,458 --> 00:44:23,993
Like I think I was
telling you earlier,

875
00:44:24,027 --> 00:44:26,295
usually, you know, it's hot
for like three days

876
00:44:26,329 --> 00:44:28,298
and then we get, like,
a spell of rain

877
00:44:28,331 --> 00:44:30,133
and everything cools off,
you know.

878
00:44:30,166 --> 00:44:32,969
This is just like steady,
steady heat.

879
00:44:34,269 --> 00:44:35,172
And...

880
00:44:36,505 --> 00:44:38,474
well we have been dealing with
it the best we can, you know?

881
00:44:38,507 --> 00:44:41,043
-Yeah.
-Makes weeding kind of a pain in the ass.

882
00:44:41,077 --> 00:44:42,412
Yeah, right?

883
00:44:52,822 --> 00:44:54,191
Did you guys eat some dinner?

884
00:44:54,224 --> 00:44:55,325
Yes, it was delicious.

885
00:44:55,358 --> 00:44:56,793
Great.

886
00:44:56,826 --> 00:45:00,996
<i>This emptiness...</i>

887
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:04,301
<i>I accept that I will be
his feast.</i>

888
00:45:04,333 --> 00:45:06,168
<i>When I open my eyes</i>

889
00:45:06,202 --> 00:45:08,338
<i>the hot breath of the beast</i>

890
00:45:08,371 --> 00:45:10,440
<i>blows my hair back.</i>

891
00:45:10,472 --> 00:45:12,108
<i>We are eye to eye.</i>

892
00:45:12,141 --> 00:45:15,745
<i>It bellows once,
loud and long,</i>

893
00:45:15,778 --> 00:45:18,248
<i>its jaws foaming
with hunger.</i>

894
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:21,183
<i>I smile,
but it alternates shape...</i>

895
00:45:21,217 --> 00:45:23,353
This is, something, I guess.

896
00:45:23,385 --> 00:45:26,523
I don't know.
I don't know how much I'm...

897
00:45:26,556 --> 00:45:30,393
I don't know how much you guys
are supposed to know about this.

898
00:45:30,425 --> 00:45:33,362
I'm surprised actually
they played it tonight.

899
00:45:36,565 --> 00:45:38,934
there's-there's some
common links in this group

900
00:45:38,967 --> 00:45:41,303
that some people have
and some people don't,

901
00:45:41,336 --> 00:45:43,039
And

902
00:45:43,072 --> 00:45:45,407
this has something
to do with that.

903
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,042
You guys,

904
00:45:47,076 --> 00:45:48,844
did everybody have
a good day today?

905
00:45:48,878 --> 00:45:50,180
-Yeah.
-Hot day.

906
00:45:50,213 --> 00:45:51,515
Felt good?
It was really hot?

907
00:45:51,547 --> 00:45:52,750
Hot day.

908
00:45:55,885 --> 00:45:57,221
That's what I heard.

909
00:45:58,588 --> 00:46:00,990
<i>Its teeth carved
with characters</i>

910
00:46:01,023 --> 00:46:05,060
<i>from an unrecognizable,
unknowable language.</i>

911
00:46:05,094 --> 00:46:07,963
Maybe turn in?

912
00:46:07,996 --> 00:46:11,167
And... I'll see you tomorrow.

913
00:46:11,201 --> 00:46:12,536
-Good night.
-Good night.

914
00:46:47,103 --> 00:46:49,338
How come you said yes
to come out here?

915
00:46:50,873 --> 00:46:52,608
Ambition?

916
00:46:52,641 --> 00:46:54,877
You want to see
your friend Nathaniel?

917
00:46:54,911 --> 00:46:56,546
You think he's been swept away
by a bunch of freaks?

918
00:46:56,579 --> 00:46:58,849
What intrigued you
about this project?

919
00:46:58,882 --> 00:47:01,451
What made you-what inspired
you to get in a car

920
00:47:01,483 --> 00:47:03,452
based off of a post card,

921
00:47:03,485 --> 00:47:06,021
and come, what is it,
two thousand miles?

922
00:47:06,054 --> 00:47:08,190
Well I don't anything about you
you don't know anything about me,

923
00:47:08,224 --> 00:47:09,893
so maybe me and you we could...

924
00:47:09,925 --> 00:47:10,826
I'm not judging you.

925
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:13,128
I know you're not judging.
Of course not.

926
00:47:13,161 --> 00:47:16,432
But maybe me and you can quit the
assumptions about each other.

927
00:47:16,465 --> 00:47:18,434
I'm all about bein' friends,
brother.

928
00:47:35,652 --> 00:47:37,354
How are you doin'?

929
00:47:37,387 --> 00:47:38,955
-I'm good.
-How are you feelin'?

930
00:47:38,987 --> 00:47:40,623
Yay!

931
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:46,929
Look.

932
00:47:46,963 --> 00:47:47,597
Yeah.

933
00:47:51,634 --> 00:47:55,672
The old bitch is runnin'?
All right!

934
00:47:55,704 --> 00:47:59,275
He, propositioned me.

935
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:01,411
-What?
-He propositioned me.

936
00:48:01,443 --> 00:48:04,146
-What do you mean?
-To come by and...

937
00:48:04,179 --> 00:48:07,616
and experiment in his tent,
or in his yurt.

938
00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:09,353
What does that mean?

939
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,122
Sexually experiment.

940
00:48:13,989 --> 00:48:15,591
-Hey, buddy.
-Yeah, no problem.

941
00:48:15,625 --> 00:48:16,592
That was a great interview.

942
00:48:16,626 --> 00:48:18,361
My pleasure.

943
00:48:25,601 --> 00:48:27,371
Where're you guys going?!

944
00:48:28,471 --> 00:48:30,639
We are going to...

945
00:48:30,672 --> 00:48:34,677
make sure nobody stepped up
into this cave, and...

946
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:36,479
dig it out a little bit.

947
00:48:44,586 --> 00:48:46,523
What's going on here, buddy?

948
00:48:46,556 --> 00:48:48,157
You know, just getting ready

949
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:50,659
to put another layer of mud
on those ovens!

950
00:48:50,693 --> 00:48:53,263
One of us!
One of us!

951
00:48:56,398 --> 00:48:57,634
Woo!

952
00:49:08,378 --> 00:49:10,747
Keep pilin' it on the bottom
he said.

953
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:12,415
My little child.

954
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:13,716
Yes, it goes in the oven.

955
00:49:36,105 --> 00:49:37,273
<i>It was getting to the point</i>

956
00:49:37,306 --> 00:49:41,443
<i>where I felt like I wasn't
really going to make it...</i>

957
00:49:41,476 --> 00:49:43,445
out there, you know?

958
00:49:43,478 --> 00:49:46,750
And I came here
and I feel important...

959
00:49:46,782 --> 00:49:48,717
<i>and I feel loved...</i>

960
00:49:48,751 --> 00:49:50,754
<i>and I don't
get in trouble.</i>

961
00:49:50,786 --> 00:49:53,222
<i>Are you going to miss us
if you stay out here for...</i>

962
00:49:53,255 --> 00:49:54,556
<i>the rest of your life?</i>

963
00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:56,693
<i>Yeah! But, I mean...</i>

964
00:49:56,726 --> 00:50:00,097
you know, depending on
how this thing all pans out...

965
00:50:02,431 --> 00:50:04,134
<i>you know,
you can come back.</i>

966
00:50:32,594 --> 00:50:34,396
Saw that lightning strike.

967
00:50:34,429 --> 00:50:35,664
See that car there?

968
00:50:35,697 --> 00:50:37,533
Those are our guys.

969
00:50:37,567 --> 00:50:38,802
Another townie.

970
00:50:40,235 --> 00:50:41,703
Man, look at...

971
00:50:41,737 --> 00:50:43,807
Jesus.

972
00:50:46,509 --> 00:50:47,710
It took em two days
to get choppers

973
00:50:47,742 --> 00:50:49,179
out to that one.

974
00:50:49,211 --> 00:50:51,480
There's only one chopper
in fucking Billings.

975
00:50:58,121 --> 00:51:00,657
Keep moving down the line, the
next guy will get what you miss!

976
00:51:07,663 --> 00:51:09,465
What are we doin', Riz?

977
00:51:09,498 --> 00:51:12,334
Stampin' out. We create a fire
barrier so it can't move.

978
00:51:12,367 --> 00:51:15,105
We burn it out here,
it'll burn back on itself.

979
00:51:20,143 --> 00:51:22,378
That's as far as it was
away from us

980
00:51:22,411 --> 00:51:23,447
when we were over there.

981
00:51:24,447 --> 00:51:26,849
We did it by ourselves.

982
00:51:28,885 --> 00:51:30,187
One more.

983
00:51:41,329 --> 00:51:43,833
Where I am now
as a human being...

984
00:51:43,865 --> 00:51:45,835
I can say that
I don't think I'll regret

985
00:51:45,867 --> 00:51:47,703
anything that's happened
out here.

986
00:51:54,610 --> 00:51:56,179
So far.

987
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:02,852
When I was interviewing Sugar,
today,

988
00:52:02,885 --> 00:52:06,356
this spider-there was a spider
inside of the tepee.

989
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:09,192
And he said...

990
00:52:09,224 --> 00:52:11,493
"I know you'e not
gonna hurt me,

991
00:52:11,527 --> 00:52:12,862
but you're not welcome here."

992
00:52:12,894 --> 00:52:17,733
And he kind of shooshed,
flooshed it out of the...

993
00:52:17,766 --> 00:52:19,101
I guess I don't
need this, Cotton.

994
00:52:19,135 --> 00:52:22,172
-He flooshed it.
-He flooshed it out of the teepee.

995
00:52:22,204 --> 00:52:24,540
Wait, so he floofed it out.

996
00:52:24,574 --> 00:52:27,543
He floofed it out of
the teepee, and he said...

997
00:52:27,577 --> 00:52:29,612
-Floof? Is that a word?
-Floofed.

998
00:52:29,644 --> 00:52:30,947
-Makes sense.
-Yeah.

999
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:34,250
Spiders are,

1000
00:52:34,282 --> 00:52:36,385
not good spirits

1001
00:52:36,418 --> 00:52:38,187
in every culture.

1002
00:52:38,221 --> 00:52:39,155
That's not true.

1003
00:52:39,755 --> 00:52:40,923
Yes?

1004
00:52:40,956 --> 00:52:43,159
-Gentlemen?
-Yeah?

1005
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:46,930
-Hi.
-Hi.

1006
00:52:46,963 --> 00:52:48,431
Hi.

1007
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:53,903
We are meeting
out in the circle right now

1008
00:52:53,936 --> 00:52:56,338
and we'd like you
to be our guests.

1009
00:52:56,371 --> 00:52:57,574
Okay.

1010
00:52:57,606 --> 00:52:59,175
-Okay?
-All right.

1011
00:53:00,943 --> 00:53:02,545
I tell you what,
if it's that difficult

1012
00:53:02,577 --> 00:53:05,215
I can take it
and take control of it and...

1013
00:53:05,248 --> 00:53:08,384
-see if I can figure it out.
-Okay.

1014
00:53:08,416 --> 00:53:09,918
Is it on?
I think it might be on.

1015
00:53:09,952 --> 00:53:11,588
And this is like
focus thing?

1016
00:53:11,621 --> 00:53:12,989
There's a red light on,
it's on.

1017
00:53:13,021 --> 00:53:14,958
-It's focusing.
-Okay. That's cool.

1018
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:17,626
-Yeah.
-Wow, this is nice.

1019
00:53:17,659 --> 00:53:20,230
-Have some fun.
... I gotta get my shoes on.

1020
00:53:20,262 --> 00:53:21,965
It's just a giant eyeball.

1021
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:25,869
Pitman was ready for bed.

1022
00:53:29,271 --> 00:53:30,773
This is gonna be fun.

1023
00:53:33,409 --> 00:53:36,512
David, please have a seat
next to Adam.

1024
00:53:36,545 --> 00:53:39,481
Adam, please have a seat
next to David.

1025
00:53:42,284 --> 00:53:43,519
We are trusting you.

1026
00:53:44,487 --> 00:53:46,722
It's time for you
to start trusting us.

1027
00:53:46,755 --> 00:53:48,324
These are our releases.

1028
00:53:51,027 --> 00:53:52,695
Thank you.

1029
00:54:19,554 --> 00:54:21,323
Sip, don't gulp.

1030
00:56:50,139 --> 00:56:51,541
It smells so nice out there.

1031
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:53,476
God, I'm movin' here.

1032
00:56:53,509 --> 00:56:55,077
Yeah, well, welcome home.

1033
00:57:33,949 --> 00:57:36,853
Stilly... Krunk, it's time.

1034
00:57:36,885 --> 00:57:38,119
Stilly, let's go.

1035
00:57:38,152 --> 00:57:39,955
Point your camera
this way, brother.

1036
00:57:39,989 --> 00:57:41,257
Yeah, come on.

1037
00:57:41,289 --> 00:57:42,958
Okay.

1038
00:57:49,898 --> 00:57:51,233
Keep the camera rolling.

1039
00:57:52,568 --> 00:57:54,537
Is your sound on?

1040
00:57:54,570 --> 00:57:56,472
Double check, boys.

1041
00:57:58,641 --> 00:58:02,278
You notice that everyone...
has not been feelin' so well.

1042
00:58:02,311 --> 00:58:03,913
Yeah.

1043
00:58:03,945 --> 00:58:05,847
We think this is the reason.

1044
00:58:08,317 --> 00:58:10,085
Yeah, there it is.

1045
00:58:13,088 --> 00:58:15,190
-Fuckin' weird!
-What is that?

1046
00:58:15,224 --> 00:58:16,726
Man.

1047
00:58:20,128 --> 00:58:21,797
This is why you're here.

1048
00:58:37,679 --> 00:58:38,914
God.

1049
00:58:43,851 --> 00:58:45,587
Stay up here, Michael.

1050
00:58:45,621 --> 00:58:47,256
God, whoa.

1051
00:58:49,123 --> 00:58:50,859
Fuckin' A.

1052
00:58:52,827 --> 00:58:54,563
It's coming from there.
That's where their sh...

1053
00:58:54,597 --> 00:58:55,665
Jesus!

1054
00:58:59,768 --> 00:59:01,871
-Pitman, over here.
-What?

1055
00:59:01,903 --> 00:59:03,672
Over here.

1056
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:07,543
What the fuck?

1057
00:59:08,610 --> 00:59:09,679
Can you hear it?

1058
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:12,648
Fuck yeah, I can hear it.

1059
00:59:12,681 --> 00:59:14,650
My God.

1060
00:59:18,653 --> 00:59:20,155
My God.

1061
00:59:20,188 --> 00:59:21,656
This is where it's coming from?

1062
00:59:21,690 --> 00:59:22,692
Yeah.

1063
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:26,996
And the further we dug it up,
the louder it got.

1064
00:59:27,028 --> 00:59:29,898
And we got to a point where
people started getting sick,

1065
00:59:29,931 --> 00:59:32,767
so we stopped and that's
when we called you guys.

1066
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:35,605
Pitman! Pitty!

1067
00:59:44,246 --> 00:59:45,648
Okay, you guys.

1068
00:59:45,681 --> 00:59:48,184
People don't know about this, not
the whole camp knows about this,

1069
00:59:48,217 --> 00:59:50,186
so you guys can't just
talk about it, all right?

1070
00:59:50,219 --> 00:59:51,987
-We're a democratic society...
-We wanted to bring them out here...

1071
00:59:52,021 --> 00:59:53,656
-you've seen that, right?
-So that they could see this, the world could see this.

1072
00:59:53,688 --> 00:59:56,324
-There was no vote on this one. This was not a choice.
-I know that. I know that.

1073
00:59:56,358 --> 00:59:59,128
-You're not helping the situation.
-To show us that thing?

1074
00:59:59,161 --> 01:00:01,230
-I just want them to know...
-Nobody knows about that thing

1075
01:00:01,262 --> 01:00:03,632
-except for the people out here right now.
-That this is...

1076
01:00:03,666 --> 01:00:05,668
We voted on having you come in
and they voted no,

1077
01:00:05,701 --> 01:00:08,304
but we did it anyway
because that thing

1078
01:00:08,336 --> 01:00:11,239
-is a fucking problem, and we need to fix it.
-I'm trying to just tell them.

1079
01:00:11,273 --> 01:00:12,240
Come over here.

1080
01:00:12,273 --> 01:00:14,210
Stilly, not everyone
is getting sick.

1081
01:00:14,242 --> 01:00:16,077
-Yeah.
... It's only certain people.

1082
01:00:16,110 --> 01:00:19,248
Is that when the,
like, the passing out and shit?

1083
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:22,050
Yeah, about a month ago,
after Nicky found it.

1084
01:00:22,083 --> 01:00:24,886
-The headaches?
-Yeah... yeah.

1085
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:27,423
As you get away from it,
do you feel better?

1086
01:00:27,456 --> 01:00:28,289
Yeah, it wears off.

1087
01:00:28,324 --> 01:00:30,425
It's nauseating,
just very nauseating.

1088
01:00:30,458 --> 01:00:32,360
Stilly, when we get close
to that fucking thing

1089
01:00:32,393 --> 01:00:34,429
it feels like your cells
are fucking vibrating.

1090
01:00:34,463 --> 01:00:36,798
It doesn't just...
You don't just hear it.

1091
01:00:36,831 --> 01:00:39,999
-Yeah.
... You feel it in your teeth.

1092
01:00:40,034 --> 01:00:41,269
You feel it everywhere!

1093
01:00:41,302 --> 01:00:43,138
And then the...
I mean...

1094
01:00:44,907 --> 01:00:47,710
Yeah, and there's
some more information.

1095
01:00:47,742 --> 01:00:48,744
Okay.

1096
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:52,882
Not everybody knows about this.

1097
01:00:52,914 --> 01:00:54,150
We've gotta go back in there.

1098
01:00:54,182 --> 01:00:55,951
And we'll talk
about this tomorrow.

1099
01:00:55,983 --> 01:00:58,920
We'll talk about how we
go about dealing with this.

1100
01:01:14,168 --> 01:01:16,071
Whoo!

1101
01:01:34,222 --> 01:01:35,824
Hey, guys.

1102
01:01:38,994 --> 01:01:40,997
Guys, hey.

1103
01:01:42,164 --> 01:01:44,333
I think something's going on
out there.

1104
01:01:47,168 --> 01:01:49,170
No, I heard-I heard...

1105
01:02:00,481 --> 01:02:03,318
-It's really fuckin' early.
-Yeah.

1106
01:02:04,286 --> 01:02:05,987
-Yeah, yeah.
-Yeah.

1107
01:02:06,021 --> 01:02:07,490
-Hey, sorry guys.
-No.

1108
01:02:07,523 --> 01:02:09,892
Unlock the door.

1109
01:02:09,925 --> 01:02:11,360
Have you guys seen Ciara?

1110
01:02:11,393 --> 01:02:12,862
No.

1111
01:02:14,463 --> 01:02:16,465
Not even before
you went to bed?

1112
01:02:16,498 --> 01:02:19,135
-No.
-I don't know.

1113
01:02:19,168 --> 01:02:21,037
Sorry, buddy.

1114
01:02:21,936 --> 01:02:23,271
Come on.

1115
01:02:24,206 --> 01:02:25,841
Have you seen Ciara?

1116
01:02:25,873 --> 01:02:27,042
No.

1117
01:02:28,543 --> 01:02:30,145
When was the last time
you saw her?

1118
01:02:30,179 --> 01:02:32,081
Did you see her
last night, or...?

1119
01:02:32,114 --> 01:02:33,849
But not this morning?

1120
01:02:33,882 --> 01:02:35,818
No, we...

1121
01:02:35,851 --> 01:02:36,952
What's up?

1122
01:02:36,985 --> 01:02:38,854
I can't...
I can't find her.

1123
01:02:38,887 --> 01:02:39,955
What's up, John?

1124
01:02:39,987 --> 01:02:41,489
Maybe she went for a walk
or something.

1125
01:02:43,057 --> 01:02:44,494
Well, she d...

1126
01:02:45,193 --> 01:02:46,528
I went to bed...

1127
01:02:47,528 --> 01:02:50,331
She never came home,
so I don't know if...

1128
01:02:50,364 --> 01:02:52,567
-What?
-She never came home last night?

1129
01:02:52,601 --> 01:02:54,871
No, she never was next to me
at all.

1130
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:03,079
Ciara!

1131
01:03:04,913 --> 01:03:06,548
Ciara!

1132
01:03:09,016 --> 01:03:10,786
Get out of my face.

1133
01:03:11,853 --> 01:03:13,288
Just find her.

1134
01:03:14,856 --> 01:03:17,358
Quit filming
and let's find her.

1135
01:03:17,391 --> 01:03:19,894
-She out there?
-No.

1136
01:03:19,927 --> 01:03:21,196
Shit.

1137
01:03:28,103 --> 01:03:29,905
-Monte?
-Yeah?

1138
01:03:29,938 --> 01:03:31,206
You okay?

1139
01:03:31,239 --> 01:03:34,275
I just got a bloody nose
and I gotta shit real bad.

1140
01:03:34,309 --> 01:03:37,479
She's usually here by now.
Where do you think she'd go?

1141
01:03:37,512 --> 01:03:39,282
You guys haven't seen her?
Really?

1142
01:03:40,282 --> 01:03:41,584
They're not doin' so good,
John.

1143
01:03:43,351 --> 01:03:44,886
What's wrong?

1144
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:47,422
Nathaniel?

1145
01:03:47,456 --> 01:03:48,557
Are you okay?

1146
01:03:48,590 --> 01:03:49,959
No.

1147
01:03:53,494 --> 01:03:54,328
Do you guys have a rag?

1148
01:03:54,362 --> 01:03:56,331
I need something.
Rizzo's bleeding.

1149
01:03:56,364 --> 01:04:00,001
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just any-anything?

1150
01:04:00,034 --> 01:04:01,570
They're really...

1151
01:04:02,536 --> 01:04:04,939
-hurting.
-What the hell's going on?

1152
01:04:07,476 --> 01:04:09,411
Ciara's missing.

1153
01:04:09,443 --> 01:04:10,512
-Are you okay?
-No.

1154
01:04:10,545 --> 01:04:12,481
Fuck.

1155
01:04:12,514 --> 01:04:14,851
Ciara's gone...

1156
01:04:15,650 --> 01:04:18,620
Rizzo seems really sick.

1157
01:04:18,653 --> 01:04:19,621
Rizzo's sick?

1158
01:04:20,822 --> 01:04:22,958
Buddy, you got a little blood
in your ear.

1159
01:04:22,990 --> 01:04:23,891
Whoa!

1160
01:04:23,925 --> 01:04:25,927
Martha.
Go to Martha, okay?

1161
01:04:28,362 --> 01:04:29,631
-Pitty.
-Nathaniel's...

1162
01:04:29,664 --> 01:04:30,833
Ciara!

1163
01:04:30,865 --> 01:04:34,936
Yeah, it seems like
something's going on.

1164
01:04:34,969 --> 01:04:35,803
Rizzo, what's goin' on?

1165
01:04:35,838 --> 01:04:37,506
Can we all come together here

1166
01:04:37,539 --> 01:04:39,575
and maybe,

1167
01:04:39,608 --> 01:04:42,111
figure out some sort
of search party thing, or...

1168
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:47,682
I have the flu or something.
I don't feel well.

1169
01:04:51,018 --> 01:04:52,387
Jesus Christ.

1170
01:04:54,188 --> 01:04:56,090
Jesus.

1171
01:04:59,695 --> 01:05:01,030
Jesus.

1172
01:05:02,297 --> 01:05:04,599
-You need water?
-Yes, please.

1173
01:05:04,632 --> 01:05:07,168
I need water.

1174
01:05:07,202 --> 01:05:08,470
I don't have a glass.

1175
01:05:10,539 --> 01:05:11,974
When's the last time
you saw her, John?

1176
01:05:12,007 --> 01:05:14,143
I saw her last night some time.

1177
01:05:14,175 --> 01:05:15,677
Stilly...

1178
01:05:18,713 --> 01:05:21,016
I'm gonna get...
I'm going to go get a doctor.

1179
01:05:21,048 --> 01:05:23,652
I'm taking your van.
I'm going to go get a doctor.

1180
01:05:23,684 --> 01:05:27,422
She could've gotten sick
and gone off.

1181
01:05:27,456 --> 01:05:28,724
What the fuck is going on?

1182
01:05:28,757 --> 01:05:30,159
I have no idea.

1183
01:05:55,784 --> 01:05:58,686
I think we all
have food poisoning.

1184
01:05:58,719 --> 01:06:01,055
It's got to be something
we ate.

1185
01:06:01,088 --> 01:06:03,525
I ate the same thing.
I feel-I feel fine.

1186
01:06:03,557 --> 01:06:05,393
Yeah, we ate the same thing.

1187
01:06:14,635 --> 01:06:16,637
Want me to turn the shower
on your head?

1188
01:06:16,670 --> 01:06:18,639
Yeah? Yeah?

1189
01:06:18,672 --> 01:06:20,575
-Put the shower on his head.
-Jesus Christ.

1190
01:06:20,608 --> 01:06:22,210
Here, drink this.
Drink this, buddy.

1191
01:06:22,244 --> 01:06:23,479
Your head hurts really bad?

1192
01:06:23,512 --> 01:06:25,514
Drink.

1193
01:06:30,719 --> 01:06:32,421
Are you fucking serious?

1194
01:06:38,092 --> 01:06:39,361
Come on!

1195
01:06:48,202 --> 01:06:49,338
Shit.

1196
01:06:49,371 --> 01:06:51,373
-Get him to the teepee!
... Okay.

1197
01:06:51,405 --> 01:06:54,208
Okay. Come on.
Come on, buddy.

1198
01:06:54,242 --> 01:06:56,111
Rooster, let's go.

1199
01:06:56,143 --> 01:06:57,812
-Come on, buddy.
-Come on.

1200
01:06:57,846 --> 01:06:59,748
Stay with me.
Keep your eyes open.

1201
01:07:07,389 --> 01:07:09,724
Ciara!

1202
01:07:18,867 --> 01:07:20,269
Are you doin' okay?

1203
01:07:25,106 --> 01:07:27,076
We need to make sure
everybody...

1204
01:07:27,108 --> 01:07:28,744
-It's not working.
-It's not turning over.

1205
01:07:28,777 --> 01:07:29,744
Jesus.

1206
01:07:30,811 --> 01:07:33,147
What the hell is going on?
Something's going on.

1207
01:07:35,317 --> 01:07:36,784
It's getting...
It's getting worse.

1208
01:07:38,652 --> 01:07:41,222
Ciara!

1209
01:07:42,757 --> 01:07:44,126
Is it working?

1210
01:07:44,826 --> 01:07:47,228
None of the cars
are fucking working?!

1211
01:07:52,467 --> 01:07:53,501
What's up?

1212
01:07:59,875 --> 01:08:01,177
Are you gonna go for help?

1213
01:08:05,813 --> 01:08:06,781
Yeah.

1214
01:08:29,770 --> 01:08:32,173
God.
Get him a rag.

1215
01:08:32,207 --> 01:08:33,542
Get him some water.

1216
01:08:45,287 --> 01:08:47,389
I feel exactly the same way

1217
01:08:47,421 --> 01:08:49,924
that everyone here who's been
kept out of the loop would feel.

1218
01:08:49,957 --> 01:08:52,226
-Who knew?
... For that we're beyond apologies.

1219
01:08:52,260 --> 01:08:53,427
What do we do?

1220
01:08:53,461 --> 01:08:54,896
We get outta here.

1221
01:08:54,930 --> 01:08:56,030
We need to get outta here.

1222
01:08:56,064 --> 01:08:58,933
I will stay back with John
and whoever else needs to

1223
01:08:58,966 --> 01:09:01,235
and we will find Ciara.

1224
01:09:01,269 --> 01:09:02,905
People need to get
their shit together,

1225
01:09:02,938 --> 01:09:07,475
only the necessities,
and start moving toward Mosby.

1226
01:09:07,509 --> 01:09:09,711
We need to stay calm.

1227
01:09:09,743 --> 01:09:11,512
This thing is something
that's above us.

1228
01:09:11,546 --> 01:09:14,615
It's something that is
beyond what we can understand.

1229
01:09:14,649 --> 01:09:16,385
We're all in this together.

1230
01:09:16,417 --> 01:09:18,920
It's everybody
who had the dream.

1231
01:09:18,953 --> 01:09:20,355
Cotton!

1232
01:09:22,591 --> 01:09:23,759
When did he leave?

1233
01:09:30,798 --> 01:09:31,667
You okay?

1234
01:09:31,699 --> 01:09:33,202
Just let me get a breath.

1235
01:09:34,269 --> 01:09:37,573
Nathaniel, what'd he mean
"the dream"?

1236
01:09:37,605 --> 01:09:38,840
Is that him up there?

1237
01:09:38,872 --> 01:09:40,841
-Shit.
-Where?

1238
01:09:40,875 --> 01:09:42,211
Krunk!

1239
01:09:43,944 --> 01:09:46,881
No, you guys go get 'em.
Andy!

1240
01:09:48,783 --> 01:09:51,420
Aw fuck! Fuck!

1241
01:09:54,256 --> 01:09:56,358
Andy, Andy!

1242
01:09:59,027 --> 01:10:00,229
I'll get his legs.

1243
01:10:06,268 --> 01:10:07,970
-No, no, no, no.
-Here, I'll take him.

1244
01:10:08,002 --> 01:10:09,871
-Help me!
-Let's get him. We got him.

1245
01:10:09,904 --> 01:10:10,973
Come on.

1246
01:10:11,006 --> 01:10:12,740
-How you doin', man?
-Jesus!

1247
01:10:12,774 --> 01:10:14,743
Water! Come on!

1248
01:10:14,775 --> 01:10:17,011
Try to get him to lay down
in bed on the table.

1249
01:10:19,613 --> 01:10:21,250
God.

1250
01:10:21,283 --> 01:10:23,418
He's bleeding. He's bleeding.

1251
01:10:23,451 --> 01:10:24,453
What do we...

1252
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:26,989
Wait...

1253
01:10:27,021 --> 01:10:29,024
-Where are you guys going?
... I got some water here!

1254
01:10:29,056 --> 01:10:30,826
I have to...

1255
01:10:30,859 --> 01:10:32,494
-I have to go!
-No!

1256
01:10:32,527 --> 01:10:34,863
I have a baby,
I have to go!

1257
01:10:43,738 --> 01:10:45,974
-You guys can't go.
-Here's some water.

1258
01:10:46,006 --> 01:10:48,277
She has a baby!

1259
01:10:48,310 --> 01:10:50,345
Put your head over...
Put your head over here.

1260
01:10:50,377 --> 01:10:51,979
-She has a baby!
-Listen!

1261
01:10:52,012 --> 01:10:54,416
The further we got away,
the worse it got!

1262
01:10:55,550 --> 01:10:57,286
The further we got away,
the worse it got!

1263
01:10:57,319 --> 01:10:58,987
-Please!
-It's in your heads!

1264
01:10:59,020 --> 01:11:01,923
-It's in your fucking head!
-Guys! You can't!

1265
01:11:01,956 --> 01:11:03,592
-Here, here, take some water.
-I love you so much!

1266
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:06,695
-You guys, you can't!
-Don't worry about it!

1267
01:11:06,728 --> 01:11:09,030
Someone's gotta follow them.
Someone's gotta...

1268
01:11:09,064 --> 01:11:10,699
-Slowly.
-What happened?

1269
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:12,833
Where you goin'?!

1270
01:11:12,868 --> 01:11:15,337
-Rizzo!
-Don't go!

1271
01:11:15,369 --> 01:11:17,072
I'm sorry!

1272
01:11:17,104 --> 01:11:19,407
-You can't go!
-No! Come back!

1273
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:21,042
The further you get on the road,
the worse you get.

1274
01:11:23,545 --> 01:11:25,047
-Okay, listen.
-Was it the tone?

1275
01:11:25,079 --> 01:11:27,082
Jesus.

1276
01:11:27,114 --> 01:11:29,384
I have a baby,
I can't!

1277
01:11:29,417 --> 01:11:30,686
It's gonna get worse!

1278
01:11:43,731 --> 01:11:44,766
Where's Tyler and Kendra?!

1279
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:47,402
It's the tone, it's the dream,
it's in the cave.

1280
01:11:47,435 --> 01:11:50,339
It's happening. Everything
that we fuck around...

1281
01:11:50,372 --> 01:11:51,773
It's happening.

1282
01:11:51,805 --> 01:11:53,375
-I don't know what.
-And it started a month ago

1283
01:11:53,408 --> 01:11:54,443
It started a month ago.

1284
01:11:54,475 --> 01:11:56,978
Rick, what dream?

1285
01:12:00,081 --> 01:12:03,351
There's 15 people here
who have had the same dream.

1286
01:12:03,385 --> 01:12:06,954
And it has to do with
that skull that's up there...

1287
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:10,792
I just think
that we have to stay calm.

1288
01:12:10,824 --> 01:12:11,926
I'm not gonna go!

1289
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:13,427
Monte's gonna walk you.

1290
01:12:13,461 --> 01:12:16,431
-Monte'll help you, okay?
-I don't wanna go!

1291
01:12:22,436 --> 01:12:26,073
I can't go.

1292
01:12:26,106 --> 01:12:29,110
Pitman and Stilwell were okay.

1293
01:12:29,144 --> 01:12:30,945
They were fine,
they were completely fine.

1294
01:12:30,979 --> 01:12:33,148
We are gonna have to get
anyone who can leave

1295
01:12:33,180 --> 01:12:34,615
pack together water.

1296
01:12:34,649 --> 01:12:36,118
You need to go get help.
Get to Mosby.

1297
01:12:36,150 --> 01:12:38,119
There is an emergency phone
at Mosby.

1298
01:12:38,153 --> 01:12:41,722
Get to Mosby, call,
get people out here.

1299
01:12:41,756 --> 01:12:43,425
I know It's ok. Listen, listen.

1300
01:12:43,457 --> 01:12:46,961
Kyle, you are gonna have
to get her out of here.

1301
01:12:46,994 --> 01:12:49,497
Get the stuff that you need,
get-get... I love you.

1302
01:12:49,530 --> 01:12:51,500
Get the stuff that you need
and start.

1303
01:12:51,533 --> 01:12:54,069
Kyle...
gather everyone at the road

1304
01:12:54,101 --> 01:12:55,436
and make sure
they're all together,

1305
01:12:55,470 --> 01:12:57,606
and then go together.
Take care of 'em.

1306
01:12:57,639 --> 01:13:00,141
-Okay, who's going?
-Anyone who's not staying, let's go.

1307
01:13:00,175 --> 01:13:01,643
They need water.
They need water.

1308
01:13:01,676 --> 01:13:03,678
Gather all the water
in smaller jugs.

1309
01:13:03,711 --> 01:13:05,814
They're all gonna leave, they're
gonna walk. It's 41 miles.

1310
01:13:05,846 --> 01:13:08,449
They got enough water, there's
enough shade along the way.

1311
01:13:08,483 --> 01:13:10,185
I mean, but it's gonna
be 24 hours

1312
01:13:10,217 --> 01:13:12,487
before anybody comes in
to get us.

1313
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:14,423
-Okay.
-It'll be 24...

1314
01:13:14,456 --> 01:13:16,958
More like 36, man.
40 miles?

1315
01:13:16,990 --> 01:13:19,194
None of them are prepared
for that kind of a hike.

1316
01:13:20,728 --> 01:13:22,163
Tyler, Kendra!

1317
01:13:22,963 --> 01:13:24,198
Come on!
We're here!

1318
01:13:31,206 --> 01:13:32,740
Okay, what happened?

1319
01:13:36,578 --> 01:13:37,879
Shit.

1320
01:13:37,912 --> 01:13:40,048
Move all those blankets
right here, since they...

1321
01:13:40,081 --> 01:13:41,149
Here? You got a pillow?

1322
01:13:41,181 --> 01:13:42,784
Hey, yeah, hey, hey.

1323
01:13:43,717 --> 01:13:46,488
It's okay. Shh.
It's okay.

1324
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:49,023
All take your boots off.

1325
01:13:49,056 --> 01:13:51,158
Tyler, get a rag on her belly.

1326
01:13:52,726 --> 01:13:54,462
-She...
-Get a rag on her belly.

1327
01:13:54,496 --> 01:13:55,896
She says she...

1328
01:13:55,930 --> 01:13:58,033
We need shade for them.

1329
01:13:58,065 --> 01:13:59,201
We need shade for them.

1330
01:13:59,234 --> 01:14:00,936
-Water...
-Let 'em get air.

1331
01:14:00,969 --> 01:14:03,137
Get an umbrella.
I'll go get the umbrella.

1332
01:14:03,171 --> 01:14:05,740
Hey, it's okay.
It's okay.

1333
01:14:08,510 --> 01:14:09,778
We don't know what the hell's
going on.

1334
01:14:09,811 --> 01:14:12,180
Mikey, please. Nobody knows what
the hell is going on, okay?

1335
01:14:12,212 --> 01:14:13,914
I don't need to you to tell me.

1336
01:14:15,949 --> 01:14:18,953
Mikey, now is not the time
for you to start telling...

1337
01:14:18,987 --> 01:14:20,855
Let her get better
and then they can see this.

1338
01:14:20,889 --> 01:14:23,024
We'll talk about
how they see this.

1339
01:14:23,056 --> 01:14:24,525
This is the f...

1340
01:14:25,292 --> 01:14:26,760
It's about her right now, okay?

1341
01:14:26,793 --> 01:14:28,028
We'll talk about
how they see this.

1342
01:14:28,061 --> 01:14:29,197
We'll talk about
how you see this.

1343
01:14:29,229 --> 01:14:31,899
I know it's important. We'll
talk about how you see it.

1344
01:14:33,568 --> 01:14:36,137
Did you have this dream?

1345
01:14:37,271 --> 01:14:39,541
-I never had the dream.
... You didn't have the dream?

1346
01:14:41,275 --> 01:14:44,880
I mean, I know about the dream.

1347
01:14:44,912 --> 01:14:47,548
I first had the dream
when I was seven...

1348
01:14:47,582 --> 01:14:49,584
and...

1349
01:14:49,617 --> 01:14:52,186
at the same time
I was friends with Karen.

1350
01:14:52,220 --> 01:14:53,255
We...

1351
01:14:54,256 --> 01:14:56,557
kept it quiet from everyone
in our lives,

1352
01:14:56,591 --> 01:14:57,626
that we shared it.

1353
01:14:57,658 --> 01:15:00,929
We just assumed we were
some sort of cosmic twin.

1354
01:15:00,962 --> 01:15:03,064
When we were younger we were
in a friend's basement

1355
01:15:03,096 --> 01:15:05,300
and she was
drawing a picture that...

1356
01:15:05,332 --> 01:15:07,969
I recognized from the dream.

1357
01:15:08,002 --> 01:15:09,905
Cut to Burning Man.

1358
01:15:09,938 --> 01:15:13,041
Another person, another person,

1359
01:15:13,073 --> 01:15:14,308
another person.

1360
01:15:14,341 --> 01:15:16,277
The more and more
we started finding out

1361
01:15:16,310 --> 01:15:18,313
that people had had it too...

1362
01:15:18,345 --> 01:15:21,582
Go on a website,
there's a blog.

1363
01:15:21,615 --> 01:15:22,984
Five more people.

1364
01:15:23,016 --> 01:15:26,121
I guess we had
kind of a mission.

1365
01:15:26,154 --> 01:15:28,590
I didn't choose this,
we were chosen.

1366
01:15:28,622 --> 01:15:31,759
Part of my dream was I was...
I was in a shack...

1367
01:15:31,792 --> 01:15:33,929
And this young person
without any genitals,

1368
01:15:33,962 --> 01:15:36,965
without any nipples,
without any belly button...

1369
01:15:36,997 --> 01:15:39,800
Have people been
discussing the dream openly?

1370
01:15:39,833 --> 01:15:42,804
It morphs between
this pit bull and...

1371
01:15:42,837 --> 01:15:43,938
A beast, a bear...

1372
01:15:43,971 --> 01:15:46,273
It's like a shape-shifter,
it can take many forms...

1373
01:15:46,306 --> 01:15:47,507
And the bear
actually services us...

1374
01:15:47,542 --> 01:15:50,679
It's the end of the fear and
the beginning of this path...

1375
01:15:50,712 --> 01:15:55,350
When after lightyears and eons
of walking with this creature,

1376
01:15:55,382 --> 01:15:58,653
our guide, our friend,
our mentor,

1377
01:15:58,685 --> 01:16:00,621
he dies at our side.

1378
01:16:00,654 --> 01:16:02,623
It decomposes
right next to me...

1379
01:16:02,657 --> 01:16:04,626
And what's left of him
instead of bear bones

1380
01:16:04,658 --> 01:16:07,328
is this giant
Tyrannosaurus Rex skull...

1381
01:16:07,362 --> 01:16:09,631
It's this T-Rex skull
in this cove...

1382
01:16:09,663 --> 01:16:12,300
With ancient etchings
in his teeth.

1383
01:16:14,202 --> 01:16:17,905
But we've never figured out
what those mean.

1384
01:16:17,939 --> 01:16:19,740
It looks...

1385
01:16:21,141 --> 01:16:24,746
exactly like it looks
up in that cave.

1386
01:16:24,779 --> 01:16:27,382
That is the reason
I sent the postcard.

1387
01:16:27,414 --> 01:16:29,818
It's a physical
manifestation of...

1388
01:16:29,850 --> 01:16:33,154
one of the main images
in this dream that we've had.

1389
01:16:34,389 --> 01:16:38,025
And at the end of that dream...
we're gone.

1390
01:16:39,827 --> 01:16:41,630
I just wish I never had it.

1391
01:16:43,363 --> 01:16:46,300
I wish I never had this dream.

1392
01:16:52,006 --> 01:16:54,242
We didn't know
how it was gonna play out...

1393
01:16:55,376 --> 01:16:59,247
and we needed someone here...

1394
01:16:59,279 --> 01:17:01,882
to see how it was
gonna play out.

1395
01:17:06,220 --> 01:17:09,923
I'm gonna let you...

1396
01:17:09,957 --> 01:17:11,326
get some rest.

1397
01:17:11,893 --> 01:17:13,060
-Okay.
-Okay.

1398
01:17:13,094 --> 01:17:14,395
Can I...

1399
01:17:16,396 --> 01:17:18,966
Can I say something to my mom?

1400
01:17:21,168 --> 01:17:22,336
Yeah.

1401
01:17:32,713 --> 01:17:34,015
Mom, I...

1402
01:18:21,895 --> 01:18:23,497
<i>Goodnight, angel.</i>

1403
01:18:32,539 --> 01:18:34,141
John!

1404
01:18:35,275 --> 01:18:36,978
Do you... Is it...
It's Ciara?

1405
01:18:37,011 --> 01:18:38,179
It's definitely Ciara.

1406
01:18:38,212 --> 01:18:39,514
Yeah?

1407
01:18:39,546 --> 01:18:40,981
We got something to show you.
Come here!

1408
01:18:41,015 --> 01:18:42,784
She doesn't leave?

1409
01:18:44,318 --> 01:18:46,186
John, I think we...

1410
01:18:46,220 --> 01:18:50,458
Last night I set up a camera
on a tripod

1411
01:18:50,490 --> 01:18:52,793
to film time lapse of the cave,

1412
01:18:52,827 --> 01:18:56,097
and... we filmed this.

1413
01:18:59,065 --> 01:19:04,404
So right there that's Ciara
on the edge of the frame there.

1414
01:19:04,438 --> 01:19:08,810
And she walks towards the cave.

1415
01:19:08,842 --> 01:19:10,511
I'll just play it, hold on.

1416
01:19:10,545 --> 01:19:13,248
'Kay, she's walking
towards the cave.

1417
01:19:14,916 --> 01:19:18,019
And then she takes off
her clothes.

1418
01:19:18,051 --> 01:19:18,987
And...

1419
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:21,456
Hold on I'll fast forward.

1420
01:19:23,423 --> 01:19:25,860
There.
She goes in the cave.

1421
01:19:27,028 --> 01:19:28,530
Look at this.

1422
01:19:28,563 --> 01:19:29,864
There's a flash!

1423
01:19:31,364 --> 01:19:33,534
She does...
she doesn't come out, Johnny.

1424
01:19:35,536 --> 01:19:37,572
No, no, no, no. No!

1425
01:19:57,859 --> 01:19:59,294
Hey, Johnny!

1426
01:20:06,067 --> 01:20:07,301
Weird.

1427
01:20:08,269 --> 01:20:11,271
It's all fucked up man.
You should...

1428
01:20:11,305 --> 01:20:13,608
They're asking about...
They're asking about you.

1429
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:15,175
We'll hang here,

1430
01:20:15,208 --> 01:20:17,945
go down there
and get some food, water.

1431
01:20:17,979 --> 01:20:19,614
Seriously. Okay?

1432
01:20:23,317 --> 01:20:25,319
One of its teeth is glowing.

1433
01:20:27,622 --> 01:20:29,024
What do you mean?

1434
01:20:31,391 --> 01:20:32,527
John!

1435
01:20:34,261 --> 01:20:35,329
It's true!

1436
01:20:38,966 --> 01:20:40,902
It's so loud!

1437
01:20:42,235 --> 01:20:45,239
What is that?
What is that?

1438
01:20:45,273 --> 01:20:46,474
Look!

1439
01:20:47,975 --> 01:20:49,377
-Do you see that?
-Yeah.

1440
01:20:49,409 --> 01:20:51,112
On the tooth.
The back tooth.

1441
01:20:51,145 --> 01:20:52,947
It's making the noise.
That's where the...

1442
01:20:52,979 --> 01:20:54,948
Jesus!
Jesus!

1443
01:20:56,951 --> 01:20:57,953
Jesus.

1444
01:20:58,953 --> 01:21:00,988
I don't think
you guys should be down there!

1445
01:21:01,021 --> 01:21:03,891
-All right. I'm gonna go back up.
-Should I just go?

1446
01:21:03,925 --> 01:21:04,659
We're going.

1447
01:21:04,692 --> 01:21:07,395
It's inside your head!

1448
01:21:11,231 --> 01:21:13,100
I don't think
you should be down there!

1449
01:21:13,134 --> 01:21:15,936
Pitman!

1450
01:21:25,947 --> 01:21:28,182
My God, it's so loud!

1451
01:21:30,117 --> 01:21:32,654
She dug it out, man!

1452
01:21:37,490 --> 01:21:40,494
It looks like a crystal.
It's like a glowing crystal.

1453
01:21:42,729 --> 01:21:44,365
What?!

1454
01:21:48,970 --> 01:21:50,204
Don't touch it.

1455
01:22:03,684 --> 01:22:06,688
I think... I don't think
we should be here.

1456
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:08,055
Okay.

1457
01:22:12,259 --> 01:22:13,994
Okay, I am coming.

1458
01:22:14,028 --> 01:22:16,097
You guys gotta help me up
out of this place.

1459
01:22:18,298 --> 01:22:20,534
Okay. I'm coming.

1460
01:22:24,270 --> 01:22:25,672
Okay.

1461
01:22:25,706 --> 01:22:27,507
You guys gotta
help me outta here.

1462
01:22:47,528 --> 01:22:48,730
Can I tell you something?

1463
01:22:48,762 --> 01:22:50,097
Yeah.

1464
01:22:50,131 --> 01:22:53,001
I'm... scared.

1465
01:22:53,033 --> 01:22:54,201
I know.

1466
01:22:55,670 --> 01:22:58,506
We can't let them see that. They're
all way more scared than we are.

1467
01:22:58,538 --> 01:23:01,108
There's a weird thing going on
in their fucking brains,

1468
01:23:01,141 --> 01:23:02,542
and I don't know.

1469
01:23:02,576 --> 01:23:05,113
They need sleep.
It's like, cra... Like...

1470
01:23:06,747 --> 01:23:08,717
They just need sleep.

1471
01:23:10,350 --> 01:23:13,520
I mean... it's been
a long fucking day.

1472
01:23:13,554 --> 01:23:15,056
I'm feeling amped up myself.

1473
01:23:15,088 --> 01:23:16,224
Yeah.

1474
01:23:16,256 --> 01:23:19,092
There's something weird
going on with them

1475
01:23:19,126 --> 01:23:20,194
that they can't leave.

1476
01:23:20,226 --> 01:23:22,396
Maybe if the day passes,

1477
01:23:22,430 --> 01:23:24,632
it was a crazy fucking day,
you know?

1478
01:23:24,664 --> 01:23:26,266
They've passed out before,
they've gotten sick

1479
01:23:26,300 --> 01:23:27,668
and then gotten better.

1480
01:23:27,701 --> 01:23:31,572
Maybe if they wake up in the
morning they will be fine.

1481
01:23:31,604 --> 01:23:35,175
You know? I mean... just...

1482
01:23:46,153 --> 01:23:47,588
Don't you think that we
should tell them, though?

1483
01:23:47,621 --> 01:23:50,123
That's probably
what is going on.

1484
01:23:50,157 --> 01:23:52,226
That's probably
why everything is happening.

1485
01:23:54,095 --> 01:23:55,195
Yeah...

1486
01:23:56,130 --> 01:23:58,065
What is...
What is telling them gonna do?

1487
01:23:58,099 --> 01:24:01,101
Yeah, look at how exhausted
everybody is in every way.

1488
01:24:01,135 --> 01:24:05,239
Like, at this moment,
is that going to do any good?

1489
01:24:06,539 --> 01:24:10,577
I think that we should set up
cameras at different points...

1490
01:24:10,610 --> 01:24:13,747
and just,
if anything happens,

1491
01:24:13,780 --> 01:24:16,283
if Ciara comes down,
if she...

1492
01:24:16,317 --> 01:24:19,453
if anyone else leaves
we'll be able to see it.

1493
01:24:19,487 --> 01:24:23,791
The help we need to do...
to perform is here, now.

1494
01:24:23,823 --> 01:24:24,591
See it through
to the end.

1495
01:24:24,625 --> 01:24:26,726
We need to put
those cameras up.

1496
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:28,663
We need to make sure...

1497
01:24:29,662 --> 01:24:31,731
Reid and Martha
are checking on people.

1498
01:24:31,765 --> 01:24:35,403
Reid is checking these yurts
so they don't fly away.

1499
01:24:36,670 --> 01:24:38,372
What was with that storm today?

1500
01:24:38,404 --> 01:24:40,640
Have you ever seen
anything like that?

1501
01:24:40,673 --> 01:24:43,344
-And that tone? That noise?
-Yeah.

1502
01:24:43,377 --> 01:24:48,149
Well the noise is...
obviously the weird thing.

1503
01:24:48,181 --> 01:24:49,583
What happened today?

1504
01:24:49,617 --> 01:24:53,488
They almost died,
our cars won't start,

1505
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:56,356
a storm hit that ripped open
a yurt,

1506
01:24:56,390 --> 01:24:58,559
40 mile-per-hour winds,

1507
01:24:58,591 --> 01:25:02,696
a glowing tooth,
someone disappeared.

1508
01:25:02,729 --> 01:25:04,664
It's a lot of crazy shit
in one day.

1509
01:25:04,698 --> 01:25:06,167
I know!

1510
01:25:10,470 --> 01:25:11,805
I'm done.

1511
01:25:13,439 --> 01:25:16,376
Bury that fucking skull.
Bury it.

1512
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:09,229
-Wake up.
-What?

1513
01:26:10,997 --> 01:26:12,332
What?

1514
01:26:30,850 --> 01:26:32,219
Karen!

1515
01:26:37,658 --> 01:26:40,428
I mean, I work up in my yurt
and Katie wasn't there.

1516
01:26:48,301 --> 01:26:49,737
Check your camera.

1517
01:26:51,305 --> 01:26:53,007
It's still rolling!

1518
01:26:53,039 --> 01:26:54,542
Still rolling.

1519
01:27:03,516 --> 01:27:04,885
Rizzo!

1520
01:27:04,917 --> 01:27:06,220
What is that?

1521
01:27:08,988 --> 01:27:10,457
Sugar!

1522
01:27:13,993 --> 01:27:15,028
What is that?

1523
01:27:15,061 --> 01:27:16,530
Rizzo...

1524
01:27:17,463 --> 01:27:18,532
This is Sugar's.

1525
01:27:18,564 --> 01:27:19,733
Rizzo.

1526
01:27:21,402 --> 01:27:23,238
Nathaniel!

1527
01:27:27,041 --> 01:27:28,610
Nathaniel!

1528
01:27:30,577 --> 01:27:31,746
Nathaniel!

1529
01:27:37,885 --> 01:27:39,887
I don't think
we should go in there!

1530
01:27:41,889 --> 01:27:43,824
Adam, I'm serious!

1531
01:27:51,030 --> 01:27:52,734
What's in there?

1532
01:27:53,634 --> 01:27:55,302
What's in there?!

1533
01:27:58,439 --> 01:27:59,907
It's empty.
