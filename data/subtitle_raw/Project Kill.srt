1
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,370
-Now what you've just
 seen is a reenactment

2
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:11,020
of a successful
 interdiction operation

3
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,380
that took place six years ago.

4
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:17,530
Interdiction and
 protective reaction.

5
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:20,450
Those will be your
 areas of duty.

6
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:24,380
This unit, which are also
 hot to become members of,

7
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:27,480
came about because of the events
 that occurred in the early 60s,

8
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,730
that is the only effective
 means of combating

9
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,170
political assassination
 by the interception

10
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,930
and the destruction of
 the assassin himself.

11
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,030
Now you might have
 been carefully selected

12
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:43,600
for this program, because
 of a high level performance

13
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,540
in the battlefield
 and your high level

14
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:50,180
performance in
 physical endurance.

15
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:53,000
But as your training
 progresses, you will gradually

16
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,760
reach a point of acceptance
 where you will begin to surpass

17
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:03,300
everything that you
 have ever done before.

18
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,090
You will reach goals that
 you never dreamed possible.

19
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:12,490
And to accomplish this,
 you will be given vitamins

20
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:16,340
to increase your stamina,
 chemical injections to expand

21
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:19,830
your mental capabilities,
 injections to assist you

22
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:22,370
in both physical
 and mental control.

23
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:23,960
You will be
 programmed to respond

24
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,850
instantaneously to
 any given stimulus.

25
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:33,730
You will become a reflex
 but highly directive unit.

26
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:36,930
Of course, you
 will be taught how

27
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:40,040
to use everyday
 objects as weapons.

28
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:45,280
Everything from a toenail
 clipping to a briefcase.

29
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,990
Control, control
 will be emphasized

30
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:51,830
throughout your training.

31
00:06:56,670 --> 00:07:03,430
Control, control is the key.

32
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:12,810
When you're finished here, you
 will be assigned to safeguard

33
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:15,640
specific individuals
 and institutions.

34
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,680
And because of your
 training here, it

35
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,300
will be set apart
 from other security

36
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,130
agencies and military
 establishments.

37
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:29,540
In other words, you will
 operate independently.

38
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,000
I am your commanding officer.

39
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,070
You will refer to me
 only as Mr. Trevor.

40
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:38,440
Your second in command,
 you will address

41
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,940
him only as Mr. Lassiter.

42
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,130
-Stand.

43
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:57,610
What's your project?

44
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:58,900
- Kill.

45
00:07:58,900 --> 00:07:59,600
-Again.

46
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,590
- Kill.

47
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:02,570
-What's your priority?

48
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:19,680
-Dossiers on the new men.

49
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,790
-Just leave them on the desk.

50
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,240
-One of them had a
 couple of tours in Nam.

51
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,120
Looks like a top prospect
 for a VIP bodyguard.

52
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:35,610
I'd say reaction to the film
 was excellent, didn't you?

53
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:36,980
-Oh, yeah.

54
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:39,320
Yeah, I wonder what the
 star of that film

55
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,930
looks like today.

56
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:43,360
-John, the original
 concept of the project is--

57
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,860
-I've had the project
 for six years, Frank.

58
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:49,310
I've had enough.

59
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:50,790
-OK.

60
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:51,810
Now you're the head of it.

61
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:53,120
Doesn't that mean something?

62
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,110
-The program has changed.

63
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:54,810
Can't you see that?

64
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:56,520
The project is different.

65
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,590
It's more drugs now,
 more mind control.

66
00:08:58,590 --> 00:08:59,630
-Well, it's necessary--

67
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,430
-The whole thing
 is wrong, Frank.

68
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,980
-Have you had your
 injections today, John?

69
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,650
-Want some water?

70
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:20,350
-Nope.

71
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:27,680
What about the injections?

72
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,330
-No, I had no injections today.

73
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:35,530
-What you're thinking
 is dangerous.

74
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:37,750
-What are you talking about,
 the drugs or the project?

75
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,300
-Both.

76
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,570
Withdrawal has
 got to be gradual.

77
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:43,390
You need to be deprogrammed.

78
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:45,390
If you're not deprogrammed,
 you'll be a menace to society,

79
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,920
to yourself, and you know that.

80
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,310
-Deprogramming takes months.

81
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,760
-Nobody gets out of here.

82
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:56,600
Not you, especially not you.

83
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,420
-I've been training
 robots here for six years,

84
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,190
for offensive purposes,
 that's what I've been told.

85
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:03,330
That's what I tell them.

86
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:06,760
Now two weeks ago,
 got three teams

87
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,930
of graduate trainees
 sent on missions abroad.

88
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:12,460
You know, I've sensed
 this for two years now.

89
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,890
I think it's true.

90
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:16,590
We're being used for
 offensive missions.

91
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,300
-That's necessary, John.

92
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:25,210
-Oh, don't give me that crap.

93
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:27,140
Wasn't born yesterday,
 didn't get here on a mule,

94
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,700
and neither did you.

95
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,670
We're being trained as hit men.

96
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,520
We can be used as
 political, corporate,

97
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,630
and commercial weapons.

98
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:36,370
And you know damn well that's
 exactly what's happening.

99
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,220
-So what the hell are
 you going to do about it?

100
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,460
-What can I do?
 I know what I can do.

101
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,110
I can hold a press
 conference, blow the whistle

102
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,590
on this Pandora's box, and put
 the whole thing down the toilet

103
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,380
where it belongs.

104
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:48,160
-You can't do that,
 and you won't do that.

105
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,120
-Frank, I'm going out.

106
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:04,280
-Lassiter 712.

107
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,240
Yeah.

108
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,000
Get me a medical survey team
 over here as soon as possible.

109
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,700
Yeah.

110
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:16,900
-I'm sorry, Frank.

111
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:34,370
-Mr. Trevor, please
 step out of the car.

112
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:36,360
-Anything wrong?

113
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,360
-I'll have to see
 your identification.

114
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:10,180
-You should never go into
 action without a recon

115
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:13,110
in the area, friend.

116
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:15,090
-Our old friend,
 Hook, ambushed me.

117
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,320
-You son of a bitch.

118
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,450
One of these years
 when you've managed

119
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:31,460
to drag your ass to Manila,
 without any advance planning,

120
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,050
I'm going to put
 another hole in it

121
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:36,590
for you, whether I
 know who you are not.

122
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:38,070
-I have to see an
 old friend, Carl.

123
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,190
You all right, Hook?

124
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,850
-Never mind about that, you two.

125
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:44,840
Let's have a drink.

126
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,480
Hook, break open the
 good booze, will you?

127
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,390
As for you, you S.O.B.,
 you've got about two minutes

128
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,900
before the bourbon
 hits the glass.

129
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,650
And I want a complete
 rundown of your activities

130
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:57,280
for the last four years.

131
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,330
Now let's make it.

132
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:09,050
Underwater detonations
 were always more dangerous.

133
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:11,680
The VC put two shells
 into my destroyer.

134
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,280
I know.

135
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,360
-You were always meant
 for sea command, Carl.

136
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,650
That's why Polish had never
 even listed you in that project.

137
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:19,390
-Hit him again.

138
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:21,370
He's getting behind.

139
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:22,770
Project.

140
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:25,810
I should have quit that after
 that training film we made.

141
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:28,100
What the hell ever
 happened to that anyway?

142
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,270
-It's around.

143
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,630
-All that training.

144
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:34,100
Me and Hook, we were the best.

145
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,570
Oh, we drew-- we drew
 a rough assignment,

146
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,510
but I tell you when
 that ship's magazine

147
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,790
when out, it was a sight to see.

148
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,410
-No, Carl, I'll never
 forgive the project

149
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:43,310
for what it did to you.

150
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:44,550
To you both.

151
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,500
And it's happening to us all.

152
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,070
Mentally.

153
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:50,200
-You mean, they
 went on with that?

154
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,210
After the war, all of it?

155
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:54,690
That's not right for you.

156
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:57,070
-Why do you say that?

157
00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:00,330
-I can see it in
 your face, John.

158
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:01,450
Cut them loose.

159
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:03,430
Let them sink in
 their own swill.

160
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:05,380
-Maybe I've done that.

161
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:08,780
-Hey.

162
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:09,760
You OK?

163
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,220
-Yeah, no, I'm fine.

164
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,190
I'm fine.

165
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,780
-Look then, why don't you
 come out here with us?

166
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,750
We can have a crew
 again, just the three of us.

167
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,630
Huh?

168
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:26,700
-Thing's can't be the
 way they were, Carl.

169
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,380
-Just remember, John, you
 can't forget the past.

170
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,360
-I know that.

171
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,830
That's the trouble.

172
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:36,800
And I've got to keep moving.

173
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,270
-Come on, hit him again.

174
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:41,170
He's fallen behind.

175
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,250
All right, a toast.

176
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:56,350
Here's to the sweet
 ladies

177
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:57,810
and their silk dresses.

178
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:10,710
-Trevor was part of
 the top secret vote

179
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:13,680
of the United States.

180
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,860
There are many other
 that are

181
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:19,840
willing to pay any
 price for what he knows.

182
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:25,820
We will comb the entire
 island resort if we have to.

183
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:29,800
But I want him alive.

184
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,800
-Yes, sir.

185
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,630
-We will find the man, sir.

186
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,110
-Yes, sir, Mr. Lee.

187
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:13,220
-Is he asleep?

188
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,780
Well, we were damn good
 sailors once, Hook,

189
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,640
in all kinds of water.

190
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:20,650
You think I need that?

191
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:29,000
The way I figure it, we got
 $300,000 in the kitty, right?

192
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,620
I'm going to take half.

193
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,610
You keep half.

194
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:35,710
When's the last time you
 took him to the doctor?

195
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:36,890
Two, what, weeks?

196
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:40,560
When he wrote to me, and
 said there was a chance

197
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:44,100
that the deterioration
 could be arrested.

198
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,030
They still feel that way?

199
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:54,580
All right, when I get
 to wherever I-- wherever

200
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:58,160
I'm going, I'll
 refill the kitty.

201
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,530
You tell him I won't
 be back for a while,

202
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:02,430
so some kind of
 military insurance,

203
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:04,990
or change in the law,
 or something

204
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:07,550
handle that.

205
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:08,960
At least we could
 buy back his legs,

206
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,720
or give him a day on a
 destroyer.

207
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,710
You go on to bed.

208
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,700
I know where my bunk is.

209
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,520
And the
 of the shore shall

210
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,980
pluck the eagle of the sea.

211
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,790
-Got time for coffee?

212
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,670
Didn't mean to upset you.

213
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:36,470
-You don't sleep
 very late, do you?

214
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:39,130
-Time enough for that
 when I'm old and infirmed.

215
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:41,130
I poured one for you.

216
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:43,660
You know, you're about
 as sneaky as an elephant.

217
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,020
-Thank you.

218
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:47,970
I'll remember that the next
 time I'm in a tight spot.

219
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:49,480
-You better remember
 it before then

220
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:53,100
if you want to get your
 butt out of that tight spot.

221
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,890
-I'm going to take the old car.

222
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:57,510
Head out to the countryside.

223
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:58,530
-Just avoid crowds.

224
00:22:58,530 --> 00:22:59,640
I checked this morning.

225
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,800
Things are going around.

226
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,740
-I need a boat, Carl.

227
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,090
-Give me a couple days,
 then call that number.

228
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:11,970
His name's Kitolis.

229
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:13,110
-When's the last
 time you saw me?

230
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:15,130
- in 1970.

231
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:16,320
-What'd I look like?

232
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,370
-Like hell.

233
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:19,320
-What will you do
 when you see me again?

234
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:23,700
-Lay you on your butt for
 the $20 you still owe me.

235
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:27,420
-If anybody comes
 by, I wasn't here.

236
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,480
-Friends?

237
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,690
-Who's got friends, Carl?

238
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,000
-OK.

239
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,490
There's your man.

240
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:19,970
-Mr. Lassiter.

241
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:20,970
I'm Lynn Walker.

242
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:24,190
I'm the US Officer.

243
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:26,960
Is there any cover story for
 the press on this situation?

244
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,660
-No.

245
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,520
There's not going to be.

246
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,760
-Well, we'll have to
 tell them something.

247
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,710
-Well, that's fine.

248
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:35,390
do the telling.

249
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,840
You see, Mr. Trevor's
 a very dangerous man.

250
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,840
I think it's best we keep
 it from the local press.

251
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:44,090
-Well, I have my job to
 do, too, Mr. Lassiter,

252
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:45,560
and I intend to do it.

253
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,480
-Mr. Lassiter.

254
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,910
I'm Inspector Cruz.

255
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:55,890
Yours, please?

256
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:06,210
This is my associate,
 Inspector Ortiz.

257
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:08,170
-How do you do, Mr. Lassiter.

258
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:09,630
-Please follow us.

259
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:23,080
- You see, we thought
 he might be here in Manila.

260
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:26,380
He mentioned a few
 people, no one by name,

261
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,630
so we suggest you
 begin by screening

262
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:32,750
the American community,
 discreetly, of course.

263
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:35,040
-You spent some
 time in Hong Kong.

264
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,830
You must know there
 are others interested

265
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:40,820
in Mr. Trevor's whereabouts.

266
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,400
Mr. Ortiz.

267
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,440
-A private plane just arrived
 at the Manila International

268
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,350
carrying seven
 undesirable passengers

269
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:51,410
by an indirect route
 through

270
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:52,410
or from Hong Kong.

271
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:53,370
-You know them?

272
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:54,890
-Uh-hmm.

273
00:25:54,890 --> 00:26:00,000
A man called Alok Lee,
 an international trader.

274
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,010
-In what?

275
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:02,110
Anything of value.

276
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:05,270
-Of course, they are
 under observation, but--

277
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,730
-But what?

278
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:08,760
-We were ordered to stand off.

279
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:13,740
Mr. Lassiter.

280
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:16,730
What do you know?

281
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:20,710
-How should I know?

282
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:24,720
-Of course, how should you know?

283
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,560
Obviously, there's
 something of great value

284
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,070
involved to bring
 Alok himself here.

285
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:31,780
- He had the.

286
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,130
- The.

287
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:35,950
Such things could be handled
 through intermediaries

288
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:37,880
and usually are.

289
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:43,170
-Uh, Inspector, I have no other
 information I can give you.

290
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:46,100
-I see.

291
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,540
Well, then, perhaps before
 you retire to your hotel

292
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,470
you might ease my
 apprehension in another area.

293
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:54,910
-Sure, if I can.

294
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:56,680
-What was Trevor's
 motive for all this?

295
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:02,350
-OK.

296
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:03,050
He has an illness.

297
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:08,700
About three weeks ago, he went
 through his annual physical

298
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,400
at Walter Reed.

299
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,020
It's a malignancy.

300
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:13,720
It's terminal.

301
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,770
And it's inoperable.

302
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:17,750
You see, Inspector,
 he's a man who

303
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:20,440
worked for government
 agencies all of his life.

304
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,290
He lived in a sterile apartment
 with sterile people around him.

305
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:25,270
-He wasn't paid well?

306
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:27,840
-Oh, yeah, quite well, but let's
 say not well enough to cover

307
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,470
a lifetime of
 experiences he never had.

308
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:34,370
A man like that wants the
 best, and it takes money.

309
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:38,190
The plates are worth
 millions, and, uh, with them

310
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:40,450
he can buy himself a new
 life regardless of how short

311
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,290
it might be.

312
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:46,820
At least that's how we
 look at it.

313
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:47,810
-I see.

314
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:04,910
-Oh, Ortiz, when you
 get back, talk to Cruz.

315
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:06,860
I didn't get Miss Walker back
 to her desk at the embassy.

316
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:21,970
-The big one is Lassiter.

317
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,300
-Why so quiet?

318
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,070
I thought you were an
 accomplished conversationalist.

319
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:15,010
-They told me about the man
 you killed in the garage.

320
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:18,980
It was an accident, Miss
 Walker, just an accident.

321
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:21,560
-That accident was
 on foreign soil.

322
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,690
It may not concern
 you, but I'm the one

323
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:26,830
who has to make the explanation.

324
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,160
-Well, you're the
 picture of efficiency.

325
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,490
It shouldn't be too
 difficult for you.

326
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:36,910
Hey, look, as long as we're
 stuck with one another,

327
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:38,390
let's try to get along, OK?

328
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:45,330
-The man you're after is
 a man like you, isn't he?

329
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:47,560
-He's not like me.

330
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,930
He's a lot better at
 his job than I am.

331
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,160
Excuse me.

332
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,430
Lassiter, I have a reservation.

333
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:20,130
-Mr. Lassiter?

334
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:20,820
-Yes.

335
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,110
-We expected you last night.

336
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:24,090
If you don't mind,
 registration, sir?

337
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:35,470
Oh, by the way, a friend of
 yours waiting at the bar.

338
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:37,800
-A friend of mine?

339
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,480
-Yes, sir, that's what he said.

340
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,110
-Did you tell
 anyone I was coming?

341
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:42,810
-No.

342
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:49,130
-Uh, where's this bar of yours?

343
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:50,350
-Straight ahead, sir.

344
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,340
-Thank you.

345
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,640
-Can I help you, sir?

346
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:21,430
-Yes, I was wondering if you
 could get me a room next to Mr.

347
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:22,610
Lassiter's?

348
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:24,880
We are going to be conducting
 some business here,

349
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,490
and we need to
 confer frequently.

350
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:49,260
-See anyone you know?

351
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,540
-No.

352
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,240
-Mr. Lassiter.

353
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,830
Well, Mr. Lassiter,
 it's been a long time.

354
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:05,240
How have you been?

355
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,600
-Do I know you?

356
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,110
-In a way.

357
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:11,560
You and your friend tried to
 wreck our car in the garage

358
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,850
this morning.

359
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:13,790
-Oh, yeah.

360
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:15,200
Excuse me a minute, boys.

361
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:22,030
Miss Walker, go
 look at the fish.

362
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:22,990
Pretty fish.

363
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:30,620
Anyway, Pancho, you said
 something about the garage?

364
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:36,360
-I just want you to know that
 we don't hold any grudge.

365
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,360
-I do.

366
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,640
-You're joking.

367
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,600
-See you, boys.

368
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,510
-Hey, wait a minute.

369
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:52,520
You and your lady friend
 Have a drink with us.

370
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:56,790
-OK.

371
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:57,490
-OK.

372
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:55,080
- Me and my.

373
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,020
Right, Ramon?

374
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:01,370
-Careful, Mr. Lassiter, don't
 have any more accidents.

375
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:23,510
-How are the pretty fish?

376
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:16,770
-Lassiter here.

377
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:18,630
- I
- have a coded message for you.

378
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:19,790
Can you take it?

379
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:20,490
-Yeah.

380
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:22,360
Security one code.

381
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,450
-OK, ready.

382
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:25,470
It's
 one, eight, windfall, 63--

383
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:28,650
043 your location.

384
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:29,350
Copy?

385
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:31,320
-OK.

386
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,310
Proceed immediately on this.

387
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:36,840
-I have it, sir.

388
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,860
Is this the only contact here?

389
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:40,160
Yes, act fast,

390
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,350
or he'll
 the whole program.

391
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:43,450
-No, I know that, sir.

392
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:44,370
He's dangerous.

393
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:45,300
-Yeah, I know he's dangerous.

394
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,020
Find him.

395
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:46,810
Get it finished.

396
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:47,630
-Right away, sir.

397
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,120
-Are you all right?

398
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,480
-What?

399
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,300
-Are you all right?

400
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,290
I saw you from over there.

401
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:10,260
-No, I'm fine.

402
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,360
I'm just fine, thank you.

403
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:23,510
Just a minute.

404
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:32,280
What, uh, what's your name?

405
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:36,520
Where do you come from?

406
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,390
-My name's Lee Su
 from the lodge.

407
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:52,230
-Uh, Lee Su, stay with me.

408
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,480
-All right.

409
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,970
Walk with me.

410
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:13,080
What's your name?

411
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:17,470
-Ryder, uh, Bill Ryder.

412
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:18,940
-Mr. Ryder.

413
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:21,150
-You're staying
 here at the lodge?

414
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:22,570
-Uh-huh.

415
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:24,070
-Have you been here long?

416
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:25,090
-A few days.

417
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:27,660
-I just came in myself.

418
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:30,580
I'm glad you're here.

419
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:34,490
I, uh, hope that we'll
 see each other again.

420
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:36,260
-I hope so, too.

421
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:55,420
The lonely
 world is a lonely place

422
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:59,840
where a lonely time
 is shared by all.

423
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:07,120
Summer, winter,
 springtime and fall.

424
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:15,290
It never rains, but
 it always pours.

425
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:19,190
And the lonely streets
 are filled with tears.

426
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:26,020
From crying eyes that
 wasted the years.

427
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:31,000
I reached out--

428
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,790
-Good evening, sir.

429
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:33,180
Table for one, sir?

430
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:38,620
-Uh, no, thank you.

431
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:41,000
I see somebody I know.

432
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:55,840
Hello.

433
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,840
-Hello.

434
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,490
-May I join you?

435
00:39:58,490 --> 00:39:59,190
-Please.

436
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,520
-Have you ordered?

437
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,990
-No.

438
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:13,740
I was hoping someone
 might join me.

439
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:16,360
-Hmm.

440
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:19,210
-Mr. Ryder.

441
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:20,850
Are you all right?

442
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:23,260
-Oh, yea, I'm fine.

443
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:26,360
Just too much night
 life, I guess.

444
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,350
Well, cheers.

445
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:32,280
-Cheers.

446
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:25,070
-Is today the day?

447
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:26,790
Found his mothership, did they?

448
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:29,050
How many?

449
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:30,500
And it's not the law?

450
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:37,610
Have a drink Mr. Hook.

451
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:38,700
Prepare to do battle.

452
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:52,170
Answer to a prayer.

453
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:58,660
Open up the door, Mr. Wagner.

454
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:01,650
We know
 you're in there.

455
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:04,650
if you cooperate,
 there will be no trouble.

456
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:07,640
You are talking to the
 , Mr. Wagner.

457
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:08,640
Open this door.

458
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:13,190
-Mr. Wagner, let me commend you.

459
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:15,530
A formidable bit of resistance.

460
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:22,890
But now that this
 is all over, I want

461
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:26,320
you to tell me what
 your friend Trevor is.

462
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:29,670
-You go to hell.

463
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:35,960
-Mr. Wagner, I do not want
 you to endure more pain.

464
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:39,840
Trevor has something
 I'm interested in,

465
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:44,200
and for which I have a customer.

466
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:47,240
You cannot win now, Mr. Wagner.

467
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:50,260
The spade will pierce
 your mask of thought.

468
00:43:54,230 --> 00:44:01,210
When I get out of here, I
 will get what I want from you.

469
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:02,590
Foolish, Mr. Wagner.

470
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:03,640
Foolish and--

471
00:44:56,730 --> 00:44:57,520
- It's.

472
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,220
Beautiful.

473
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:02,710
- Beautiful.

474
00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:07,710
-No, it's a word I haven't
 used for a long time.

475
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:10,700
-Why?

476
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:14,180
-Well, I just traveled
 in the wrong circles.

477
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:23,650
-You're a strange
 man, Mr. Ryder.

478
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:29,620
But I think I like you.

479
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:31,610
Shall we walk?

480
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:16,990
-May I see your ID, please?

481
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:30,940
Well, Mr. Lassiter.

482
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:32,440
Strange meeting you here.

483
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:34,930
Coincidence no doubt.

484
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:36,860
-What happened?

485
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:38,770
-A battle, obviously.

486
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:40,210
-Oh.

487
00:46:40,210 --> 00:46:42,460
Miss Walker, if this is a
 bit much for your stomach,

488
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:44,650
you can, uh, wait in the car.

489
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,380
OK, Cruz, how'd you
 find out about--

490
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:51,350
-Routine investigation.

491
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:56,220
A dossier on Trevor
 was most interesting.

492
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:58,840
It will be in the
 name of history.

493
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:00,600
We cross check that
 with a list of Americans

494
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:01,970
who live here in Manila.

495
00:47:01,970 --> 00:47:05,720
And we came up with one
 man who served with him.

496
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:06,750
Carl Wagner.

497
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:10,800
A winner of the Navy Cross
 for gallantry in action.

498
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,660
Gallantry, Mr. Lassiter.

499
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:14,890
You know what the word means?

500
00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:21,440
-Who can afford gallantry
 these days, Cruz?

501
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:25,280
-You may be right, of
 course it is an old word,

502
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,290
but not everyone
 has forgotten it.

503
00:47:27,290 --> 00:47:28,890
-Where is he?

504
00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:29,590
-Outside.

505
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:44,560
-Oh, my god.

506
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:45,890
-What are you going
 to do about this?

507
00:47:45,890 --> 00:47:48,300
--his
 associates from Hong Kong.

508
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:49,690
At the moment, nothing.

509
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:54,040
-How'd he find out about Wagner?

510
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:56,900
-How did you find
 out about Wagner?

511
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:18,270
-Operator, I've been
 trying for a half an hour.

512
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:19,260
Wagner.

513
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:24,850
Wagner, W-A-G-N-E-R.
 That's right.

514
00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:25,780
That's the number.

515
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:31,080
Disconnected when?

516
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,570
All right, fine.

517
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:33,570
Thank you.

518
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:02,920
-Is something wrong?

519
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:04,120
-I'm sorry.

520
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:06,180
I didn't mean to wake you.

521
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:08,610
No, there's nothing wrong.

522
00:49:08,610 --> 00:49:10,530
Just trying to
 contact an old friend.

523
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:12,370
It's OK.

524
00:49:12,370 --> 00:49:15,520
-Don't you sleep?

525
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,180
-Old habits hard to break.

526
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:24,410
-You've seen much trouble
 haven't you, Mr. Ryder?

527
00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:25,410
-A little.

528
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:30,590
-You have no monopoly on that.

529
00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:31,770
-On what?

530
00:49:31,770 --> 00:49:32,670
-Trouble.

531
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:36,140
-I know that, too, but I'm a
 little concerned about my own,

532
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:36,840
though.

533
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:40,760
-Yes, because you
 know them best.

534
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:43,700
You want much in life.

535
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:48,110
I mean, of life.

536
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:49,580
-Not much.

537
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:54,000
All I know is I don't want
 what I've had anymore.

538
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,950
And I don't know
 what's up front,

539
00:49:56,950 --> 00:50:00,380
because I'm used to that.

540
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:07,420
I'm feeling like a--
 like a kid, weak inside.

541
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:11,020
If I cashed out tomorrow,
 not a single person

542
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:13,430
would ever know I existed.

543
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:16,770
And really, I'd just be
 another dead soldier.

544
00:50:16,770 --> 00:50:21,010
And I think that what
 I want is someone

545
00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:26,420
who really cares
 that I've been alive.

546
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:29,000
You know, someone I can trust.

547
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,650
And someone who would trust me.

548
00:50:31,650 --> 00:50:34,070
A woman.

549
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:39,390
-It's not a want, same as I.

550
00:50:39,390 --> 00:50:42,150
-Oh, who the hell
 knows what they want

551
00:50:42,150 --> 00:50:44,890
or who the hell knows anything?

552
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:52,230
-I am but one, and
 you want many things.

553
00:50:52,230 --> 00:50:58,290
-Well, you see how foolish I am.

554
00:50:58,290 --> 00:51:00,280
-No.

555
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:01,870
Dreaming is not foolish.

556
00:51:05,370 --> 00:51:08,470
I will dream with you.

557
00:51:08,470 --> 00:51:13,880
And if you also want,
 I will love you.

558
00:51:49,330 --> 00:51:50,620
-That was Trevor.

559
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:51,320
Hurry.

560
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:52,320
Let's go.

561
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:29,300
-Hold on.

562
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:30,790
I think we've got company.

563
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,060
-You idiot.

564
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:53,780
-Mr. Cruz asked me to
 join him this morning.

565
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:57,660
-Now, first things first,
 a letter from your agency.

566
00:53:57,660 --> 00:54:01,040
-I already won Mr. Lassiter.

567
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:01,740
-Excuse me.

568
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:03,260
Pardon me, Chief Inspector Cruz.

569
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:03,960
-Yes.

570
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:06,470
-You have a telephone
 call on our private phone.

571
00:54:06,470 --> 00:54:07,450
Urgent, please.

572
00:54:07,450 --> 00:54:08,430
-Thank you.

573
00:54:08,430 --> 00:54:09,420
Excuse me.

574
00:54:14,330 --> 00:54:18,330
-Have you been in counselor
 service long, Miss Walker?

575
00:54:18,330 --> 00:54:19,030
-Four years.

576
00:54:19,030 --> 00:54:19,730
-Dedicated?

577
00:54:19,730 --> 00:54:22,670
-Well, of course.

578
00:54:22,670 --> 00:54:25,270
-This is a secret priority
 one message I read

579
00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:27,280
and I understand it.

580
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:27,980
-What shou I do?

581
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:29,640
What would you do with it?

582
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:32,550
-Well, shred it and burn it.

583
00:54:32,550 --> 00:54:34,010
-I can't do that here.

584
00:54:34,010 --> 00:54:36,920
-I don't understand
 what you're getting at.

585
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:39,960
-Oh, if you're really dedicated,
 you'd grab it and eat it.

586
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:42,510
Then you wouldn't use a
 public toilet for two weeks.

587
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:48,540
-We just got some
 information of your friend.

588
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:49,960
-What?

589
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:50,920
- Mr. Cruz.

590
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:51,620
-Go ahead.

591
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:55,190
We have just confirmed a
 report that Mr. Trevor was seen

592
00:54:55,190 --> 00:54:58,340
this morning accompanied
 by a Chinese woman

593
00:54:58,340 --> 00:55:01,140
along the vicinity of
 Lake Lodge.

594
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:02,970
There is also a report
 from the highway patrol

595
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:06,110
that this same vehicle was
 involved in a high speed

596
00:55:06,110 --> 00:55:08,720
racing along the Lake Highway.

597
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,430
-Where is he?

598
00:55:10,430 --> 00:55:13,200
-There is no further report,
 sir, except that the vehicle

599
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,640
was not apprehended and
 has not been sighted since.

600
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:17,670
Well, how far is this
 Lake.

601
00:55:17,670 --> 00:55:19,700
-Just a short trip by rail.

602
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:21,470
-Why don't we get up
 there, like, right away?

603
00:55:21,470 --> 00:55:23,920
-Everything has been
 arranged for, Mr. Lassiter.

604
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:26,930
- You have 45 minutes
 to.

605
00:55:26,930 --> 00:55:27,700
-Give me a few minutes.

606
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:30,660
I'll throw a few things in my
 bag, and I'll be right down.

607
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,720
-So you have 45 minutes.

608
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,620
If
 you had taken proper security

609
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:36,550
measures to begin with,
 that phone conversation

610
00:55:36,550 --> 00:55:37,420
never would have happened.

611
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:38,830
Time is getting short.

612
00:55:38,830 --> 00:55:40,910
-I'm aware of the time element.

613
00:55:40,910 --> 00:55:42,320
Nine days is all we can expect.

614
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:43,020
-What?

615
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:45,260
Well, he's already gone 10 days.

616
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:48,160
-He's beyond normal restraints.

617
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:49,870
-Sir, I have another
 hot tip for you.

618
00:55:49,870 --> 00:55:50,810
Somebody took my medication.

619
00:55:50,810 --> 00:55:52,540
-And your last injection?

620
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:53,390
-About 30 hours.

621
00:55:53,390 --> 00:55:54,490
I assume

622
00:55:54,490 --> 00:55:55,640
it was in your attache case.

623
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:56,910
Did they steal that, too?

624
00:55:56,910 --> 00:55:57,610
-Yeah.

625
00:55:57,610 --> 00:55:58,810
You Trevor.

626
00:55:58,810 --> 00:56:00,780
-But what happens if I
 don't get to him in time?

627
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:03,290
What happens if he goes
 completely off the deep end?

628
00:56:03,290 --> 00:56:06,070
If you're still capable of
 handling the operation quietly

629
00:56:06,070 --> 00:56:07,880
with no publicity,
 we can alleviate--

630
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:09,010
-But personally,
 sir, I don't give

631
00:56:09,010 --> 00:56:10,150
a damn about the publicity.

632
00:56:10,150 --> 00:56:11,000
What about the man?

633
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,890
What do I do?

634
00:56:12,890 --> 00:56:13,920
What do I do?

635
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,720
-This is a priority
 one situation,

636
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:18,150
which with serious
 international implications.

637
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:19,260
You may have no choice.

638
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:23,590
Bring him back or
 I'll eliminate him.

639
00:56:23,590 --> 00:56:25,320
-I just wanted to
 hear you say it, sir.

640
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:33,130
Miss Walker, who authorized
 this trip anyway?

641
00:56:33,130 --> 00:56:35,070
-I told you before.

642
00:56:35,070 --> 00:56:36,290
I can take care of myself.

643
00:56:36,290 --> 00:56:41,110
I authorize my own trips, and
 I go where I feel I have to go.

644
00:56:41,110 --> 00:56:44,490
And let me give you a
 bit of advice, Mister.

645
00:56:44,490 --> 00:56:47,380
Pull any more of your
 superiority gimmicks,

646
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:49,740
and this is one
 Ratclife girl who

647
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:53,230
can have you deported
 in nothing flat.

648
00:56:53,230 --> 00:56:54,230
-Oh, really?

649
00:56:54,230 --> 00:56:55,220
-That's right.

650
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:57,210
And I mean it.

651
00:56:57,210 --> 00:57:00,200
-All right, by all means,
 be my guest, Miss Walker.

652
00:57:08,670 --> 00:57:11,410
-I'd like to remind
 you, gentlemen, we

653
00:57:11,410 --> 00:57:15,140
have no way of finding
 out how many, if any,

654
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:17,130
of the Hong Kong
 are still

655
00:57:17,130 --> 00:57:19,130
in the vicinity.

656
00:57:19,130 --> 00:57:23,110
So this trip is primarily
 one of investigation.

657
00:57:23,110 --> 00:57:26,600
Sergeant, please
 see to our seats.

658
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:27,590
-Yes, sir.

659
00:57:27,590 --> 00:57:29,580
-Lassiter, are you ready?

660
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:33,570
-Not really, Cruz, I can't
 get used to the heat out here.

661
00:57:33,570 --> 00:57:35,860
-Something you'll have to bear.

662
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:36,560
Let's go.

663
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:33,830
-Everybody, get down.

664
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:41,300
Get an ambulance.

665
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:47,770
How's Ortiz?

666
00:58:47,770 --> 00:58:50,520
-It's not serious.

667
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:52,930
No major organs damaged.

668
00:58:52,930 --> 00:58:54,980
In fact, he'll be released
 in a couple of weeks.

669
00:58:56,330 --> 00:58:58,290
You reacted very quickly.

670
00:58:58,290 --> 00:59:02,200
It could have been worse.

671
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:03,180
-OK, OK.

672
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:05,620
So I'm a terrific person.

673
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:07,580
What about Trevor?

674
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:11,980
-Well, since the attack was
 made before we left the depot,

675
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:14,290
I assume that Alok
 is still in Manila.

676
00:59:14,290 --> 00:59:18,670
Which leads me to conclude
 that Trevor is also here.

677
00:59:18,670 --> 00:59:20,130
He'll be located.

678
00:59:20,130 --> 00:59:21,590
-Hey, wait a minute.

679
00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:22,570
Wait a minute.

680
00:59:22,570 --> 00:59:25,980
What if your
 assumption is wrong?

681
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:27,870
What if he doesn't
 have the time,

682
00:59:27,870 --> 00:59:29,980
and what if he bumps
 the car in the meantime?

683
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:33,530
- There are only so many
 people on who

684
00:59:33,530 --> 00:59:35,310
could or would help
 him off the island.

685
00:59:35,310 --> 00:59:37,240
And we know all of them.

686
00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:41,120
-And Alok doesn't know
 those people, too?

687
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:44,020
Look, we're not
 dealing with a moron.

688
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:45,880
Alok
 business is abroad.

689
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:48,770
Listen, it would be
 of great help to us

690
00:59:48,770 --> 00:59:51,670
if you were to cooperate fully.

691
00:59:51,670 --> 00:59:53,730
And stop withholding
 information intentionally.

692
00:59:53,730 --> 00:59:56,210
-Oh, gee.

693
00:59:56,210 --> 00:59:57,200
Come on.

694
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,690
We're back to that one, huh?

695
00:59:58,690 --> 01:00:01,660
-We never left
 there Mr. Lassiter.

696
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:06,130
Look, if I were to accept your
 excuse for wanting

697
01:00:06,130 --> 01:00:08,110
Trevor, I'd have to ask
 many more questions.

698
01:00:08,110 --> 01:00:10,100
I don't think that's necessary.

699
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:14,410
If Alok wanted those things,
 he'd have bought them.

700
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:16,960
But what he wants is
 the man, and that's

701
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:18,060
quite a different thing.

702
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:20,270
-What's different?

703
01:00:20,270 --> 01:00:22,160
Hmm?

704
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:25,520
Mr. Lassiter, the difference
 is that if you want

705
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:28,290
to play game, you
 can go do it somewhere else.

706
01:00:28,290 --> 01:00:29,750
Not in my country.

707
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:33,830
-I think you forget.

708
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:37,740
I am here by accident,
 not choice or design.

709
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:41,230
-That's precisely my point.

710
01:00:41,230 --> 01:00:44,040
Look, the stupidity,
 the stupidity of which

711
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,490
this operation has
 been handled has

712
01:00:45,490 --> 01:00:47,860
been nothing but a complicated
 situation from the start.

713
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:48,560
-I agree.

714
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:50,190
Because I'm not directing it.

715
01:00:50,190 --> 01:00:51,110
-I know.

716
01:00:51,110 --> 01:00:53,880
But when you're in the
 Philippine's, I am.

717
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:55,090
And Mr. Lassiter.

718
01:00:55,090 --> 01:00:58,610
you will cooperate, or
 you can get the hell out.

719
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:54,860
What
 are you doing for him?

720
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:56,300
, that is all.

721
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:58,160
That is not all.

722
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:01,960
You tell us what arrangements
 did you make with him?

723
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:02,660
None.

724
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:05,480
He boat
 to contact me again.

725
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:07,300
What
 does he want from you?

726
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:09,120
A boat.

727
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:10,720
Did
 he ask for that?

728
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:11,490
No, no.

729
01:02:11,490 --> 01:02:12,190
Wagner called.

730
01:02:12,190 --> 01:02:14,540
He said that, uh--

731
01:02:14,540 --> 01:02:18,530
So, ah-ah,
 you lied about Wagner.

732
01:02:18,530 --> 01:02:21,550
Please,
 please, I just sell service

733
01:02:21,550 --> 01:02:23,370
and that is all.

734
01:02:23,370 --> 01:02:26,670
You are going to
 tell us everything about this.

735
01:02:26,670 --> 01:02:27,840
Do you hear me?

736
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:29,780
Everything.

737
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:31,000
Do you understand?

738
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,110
No, no, I--

739
01:02:47,550 --> 01:02:50,570
-You have a friend named Wagner?

740
01:02:50,570 --> 01:02:52,770
-Yes.

741
01:02:52,770 --> 01:02:56,910
-So do I. What can I do for you?

742
01:02:56,910 --> 01:02:59,730
-I have a business
 proposition for you.

743
01:02:59,730 --> 01:03:01,850
-You might come in
 and talk about it.

744
01:03:01,850 --> 01:03:04,340
-Yes, that's exactly
 what I have in mind.

745
01:03:14,580 --> 01:03:16,790
-They work for Alok Lee
 and international dealer

746
01:03:16,790 --> 01:03:17,840
from Hong Kong.

747
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:19,750
-Who's this?

748
01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:20,970
-My secretary.

749
01:03:20,970 --> 01:03:23,310
They killed the poor man.

750
01:03:23,310 --> 01:03:26,570
He couldn't tell them
 what he didn't know.

751
01:03:26,570 --> 01:03:29,750
-And you?

752
01:03:29,750 --> 01:03:30,810
-They mentioned Wagner.

753
01:03:30,810 --> 01:03:33,830
And a man named Trevor.

754
01:03:33,830 --> 01:03:34,530
You?

755
01:03:34,530 --> 01:03:37,120
-What about Wagner?

756
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:39,850
-He's dead.

757
01:03:39,850 --> 01:03:40,550
-What?

758
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:41,630
-He is dead.

759
01:03:53,370 --> 01:03:56,210
-You have any liquor here?

760
01:03:56,210 --> 01:03:57,910
-Yes.

761
01:03:57,910 --> 01:04:01,400
-Then pour two drinks, and
 pour them where I can see you.

762
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:23,050
I need a boat.

763
01:04:23,050 --> 01:04:23,750
-I know.

764
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:25,840
-Tonight.

765
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:27,510
-Out of the
 question, impossible.

766
01:04:27,510 --> 01:04:29,060
It would take at least a week.

767
01:04:29,060 --> 01:04:33,200
I'll give you $50,000, two days.

768
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:34,290
-$75,000, three days.

769
01:04:34,290 --> 01:04:37,240
The best I can do.

770
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:38,820
-All right, it's a deal.

771
01:04:42,910 --> 01:04:47,340
There's $50,000, and
 I'll call you tomorrow.

772
01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:48,390
There'll be two of us.

773
01:04:48,390 --> 01:04:49,370
-Two?

774
01:04:49,370 --> 01:04:53,020
In that case the
 price will be $25,000.

775
01:04:53,020 --> 01:04:56,980
-Well, Mr. Wagner
 and I have done

776
01:04:56,980 --> 01:04:58,670
much business over the years.

777
01:04:58,670 --> 01:05:00,410
Profitable business I might add.

778
01:05:00,410 --> 01:05:04,090
-Yeah, I know all about it.

779
01:05:04,090 --> 01:05:07,920
Here's to fools and sailors.

780
01:05:21,340 --> 01:05:24,350
-Well, well, Miss Walker, if
 you don't stop following me,

781
01:05:24,350 --> 01:05:26,160
I'm going to call the police.

782
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:27,430
-I'm working with the police.

783
01:05:27,430 --> 01:05:28,510
-Oh, yeah, I forgot.

784
01:05:28,510 --> 01:05:30,560
I'm sorry.

785
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:31,430
-You've been drinking.

786
01:05:31,430 --> 01:05:36,340
-Damn, I wish I could.

787
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:39,610
Hey, could I offer you one?

788
01:05:39,610 --> 01:05:42,080
We can't be machines
 all the time, you know.

789
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:44,580
-I don't drink on duty.

790
01:05:44,580 --> 01:05:46,260
-It won't rust your gears.

791
01:05:46,260 --> 01:05:49,470
-No thank you.

792
01:05:49,470 --> 01:05:52,890
-Miss Walker, for someone who's
 done so much for their country,

793
01:05:52,890 --> 01:05:55,370
you deserve a little enjoyment.

794
01:05:55,370 --> 01:05:58,860
-Well, there is one
 little bit of enjoyment

795
01:05:58,860 --> 01:06:00,940
I will allow myself.

796
01:06:00,940 --> 01:06:01,630
-OK.

797
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:12,520
-Before I left for
 the train today,

798
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:14,440
I received a message
 from my director

799
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:17,410
asking me to call
 off this thing.

800
01:06:17,410 --> 01:06:18,560
You arranged that, didn't you?

801
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:20,050
-No, I didn't.

802
01:06:20,050 --> 01:06:22,380
But it's cool, because
 you don't belong here,

803
01:06:22,380 --> 01:06:24,830
and I don't want you here.

804
01:06:24,830 --> 01:06:26,920
-Oh, man's work, is that it?

805
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:28,630
-Golly, you guessed it.

806
01:06:28,630 --> 01:06:30,610
-It was all right
 a few seconds ago

807
01:06:30,610 --> 01:06:32,430
when you wanted a few
 creature comforts.

808
01:06:32,430 --> 01:06:33,890
-You guessed it again.

809
01:06:38,630 --> 01:06:41,120
-Oh, you are a son of a bitch.

810
01:07:38,890 --> 01:07:41,880
-Lee Su.

811
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:42,870
Forgive me.

812
01:07:48,650 --> 01:07:49,350
-Why?

813
01:07:49,350 --> 01:07:51,840
Why did you--

814
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:53,330
-Please, believe me.

815
01:07:53,330 --> 01:07:56,320
I can't help it.

816
01:07:56,320 --> 01:08:00,300
-I don't understand.

817
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:03,790
-I take drugs.

818
01:08:03,790 --> 01:08:04,790
drugs.

819
01:08:11,260 --> 01:08:15,740
I mean it that I'm part
 of a military program,

820
01:08:15,740 --> 01:08:19,730
and I train men to kill.

821
01:08:19,730 --> 01:08:23,210
I train them, and
 I am one of them.

822
01:08:23,210 --> 01:08:25,200
And we use drugs
 in the programs.

823
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:30,180
I've taken myself off the drugs,
 but they're part of my control.

824
01:08:30,180 --> 01:08:33,740
Without them, my response
 is I wake up dangerous.

825
01:08:33,740 --> 01:08:36,720
I thought I could handle it.

826
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:42,690
And I need.

827
01:08:42,690 --> 01:08:43,680
- The.

828
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:45,670
I brought it.

829
01:08:45,670 --> 01:08:47,660
-Where?

830
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:49,150
Give it to me.

831
01:08:55,110 --> 01:08:56,600
Get some water.

832
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:33,200
It's not the same
 anymore for me.

833
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:36,630
I don't know where
 it's different,

834
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:42,530
but it is different for me now.

835
01:09:42,530 --> 01:09:44,390
And when all of
 this is out of me--

836
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:45,090
-Shh.

837
01:09:45,090 --> 01:09:47,520
The pills.

838
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:51,680
-Yeah, pills.

839
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:53,160
That's something different.

840
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:55,220
That's never happened before.

841
01:09:55,220 --> 01:09:55,920
Interesting.

842
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:06,260
He said, I'm not
 programmed for love.

843
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:33,270
-Remember what I said.

844
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:37,810
Tell him no more, no
 less, but get him here.

845
01:10:45,770 --> 01:10:48,120
-Yes.

846
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:50,900
Yes, it is.

847
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:52,880
I have it all arranged.

848
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:53,790
This afternoon.

849
01:10:56,970 --> 01:10:58,570
At the old wharf
 near the dry dock

850
01:10:58,570 --> 01:11:00,240
and bring the rest of the money.

851
01:11:04,170 --> 01:11:05,670
Very well.

852
01:11:05,670 --> 01:11:06,610
I'll be waiting for you.

853
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,450
-Excellent.

854
01:11:11,450 --> 01:11:12,240
Excellent.

855
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:13,860
Very well done.

856
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:15,680
-Now may I-- aaah.

857
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:27,270
-A most interesting analysis.

858
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:33,170
The attache case we found
 in Mr. Lassiter's room

859
01:11:33,170 --> 01:11:36,470
was quite interesting.

860
01:11:36,470 --> 01:11:42,530
,
 manipulative, mind drugs,

861
01:11:42,530 --> 01:11:45,880
and yet in Mr.
 Lassiter's attache

862
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:50,450
case-- tell me, old friend.

863
01:11:50,450 --> 01:11:53,150
Did Trevor appear
 pale when you saw him?

864
01:11:53,150 --> 01:11:54,510
-No.

865
01:11:54,510 --> 01:11:56,000
-Did his hand shake?

866
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:56,990
-I don't know.

867
01:11:56,990 --> 01:11:58,660
-His eyes, how
 did his eyes look?

868
01:11:58,660 --> 01:11:59,730
-I don't know.

869
01:11:59,730 --> 01:12:01,240
I don't know.

870
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:04,280
-You are not very
 observant, old friend.

871
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:08,170
I was so certain you would
 have much to tell me.

872
01:12:08,170 --> 01:12:11,070
I told you I would pay you
 for your services, didn't I?

873
01:12:14,650 --> 01:12:16,380
-No, wait.

874
01:12:16,380 --> 01:12:17,910
I helped you.

875
01:12:17,910 --> 01:12:19,860
I did as you asked.

876
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:22,050
-We'll burn some incense
 for you, dear friend.

877
01:12:22,050 --> 01:12:22,910
-No, no.

878
01:12:22,910 --> 01:12:25,140
You promised me.

879
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:26,430
We had a deal.

880
01:12:26,430 --> 01:12:28,590
No, no, please.

881
01:12:28,590 --> 01:12:33,570
-Yes, you are being
 paid to have no fear.

882
01:12:33,570 --> 01:12:36,720
I leave you in very
 experienced hands.

883
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:40,720
It will be a beautiful thing.

884
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:41,570
He's an artiste.

885
01:13:05,670 --> 01:13:08,420
-Well, good morning Miss Walker.

886
01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:09,310
-Headache, Mr. Lassiter?

887
01:13:32,270 --> 01:13:35,880
You know, Kitolis who
 lives here specializes

888
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:38,840
in procurements of all kinds.

889
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:42,810
Either he or Trevor left
 two bodies here yesterday.

890
01:13:42,810 --> 01:13:44,300
And, uh, William.

891
01:14:09,650 --> 01:14:12,130
-You going to tell
 me where Trevor is?

892
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:25,060
-Stop it.

893
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:26,050
Stop that.

894
01:14:26,050 --> 01:14:27,540
We can use him.

895
01:14:36,490 --> 01:14:41,100
-Inspector, I didn't
 throw one killing punch.

896
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:43,200
-Well, it's a good thing you
 didn't, because he knows a lot.

897
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:45,890
We'll make him talk.

898
01:14:45,890 --> 01:14:46,590
He'll talk.

899
01:14:46,590 --> 01:14:51,080
I promise you, you can
 finish him off if he doesn't.

900
01:15:00,060 --> 01:15:06,050
-Well, Cruz, I hope that
 dude was telling the truth.

901
01:15:06,050 --> 01:15:09,540
How far is it to this wharf?

902
01:15:09,540 --> 01:15:11,040
-Just a few minutes.

903
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:14,040
Our surface unit should
 be closing in now

904
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:17,030
quietly, no sirens.

905
01:15:17,030 --> 01:15:18,530
-I'm against this.

906
01:15:18,530 --> 01:15:21,520
You know, if we go
 in there like

907
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:29,500
a squad of marines,
 Trevor might, might break.

908
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:32,000
-Thank you Mr. Lassiter.

909
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
It's unfortunate
 that your superiors

910
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,990
didn't give you another option.

911
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:39,980
-Frank.

912
01:15:46,970 --> 01:15:49,460
I know what you're going to do.

913
01:15:49,460 --> 01:15:53,960
You're going to try to
 take him alone, aren't you?

914
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:56,450
-The only thing I can do.

915
01:15:56,450 --> 01:15:58,450
-But what if he
 doesn't listen to you?

916
01:15:58,450 --> 01:15:59,940
What if he resists?

917
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:04,310
-All right.

918
01:17:04,310 --> 01:17:07,130
No matter what happens,
 you stay here in the car.

919
01:17:07,130 --> 01:17:10,310
It's going to be all
 right, but don't you

920
01:17:10,310 --> 01:17:12,290
move until I get back.

921
01:17:16,940 --> 01:17:19,050
-Mr. Ryder.

922
01:17:19,050 --> 01:17:21,040
Will you kiss me?

923
01:19:25,290 --> 01:19:26,930
-Mr. Trevor.

924
01:19:26,930 --> 01:19:31,070
We are about to meet at last.

925
01:19:31,070 --> 01:19:34,730
There is no need
 to hide from me.

926
01:19:34,730 --> 01:19:37,100
You are completely surrounded.

927
01:19:37,100 --> 01:19:39,310
Cut off.

928
01:19:39,310 --> 01:19:41,060
And we have the girl.

929
01:19:48,210 --> 01:19:49,670
-Who are you?

930
01:19:49,670 --> 01:19:53,100
-That doesn't matter, does it?

931
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:58,180
You have something I want,
 and I have something you want.

932
01:19:58,180 --> 01:20:01,130
-All right.

933
01:20:01,130 --> 01:20:03,430
What do you want?

934
01:20:03,430 --> 01:20:06,740
-Come out without your weapon.

935
01:20:06,740 --> 01:20:10,840
And I'll come out without mine.

936
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:13,290
We can settle this with
 no further trouble.

937
01:20:21,270 --> 01:20:51,570
Come, Mr. Trevor Here is
 Mr. Lassiter's attache case.

938
01:20:51,570 --> 01:20:54,060
We'll leave for you.

939
01:20:54,060 --> 01:20:55,320
-Frank Lassiter's here?

940
01:20:58,250 --> 01:20:58,980
-Come closer.

941
01:20:58,980 --> 01:21:01,620
I do not want to shout.

942
01:21:01,620 --> 01:21:04,230
-This is what you get.

943
01:21:04,230 --> 01:21:05,820
Now what?

944
01:21:05,820 --> 01:21:08,180
-Very well.

945
01:21:08,180 --> 01:21:10,350
Project Kill is what I want.

946
01:21:10,350 --> 01:21:15,290
I want to know
 everything about it.

947
01:21:15,290 --> 01:21:18,330
I will trade you
 the girl's life.

948
01:21:18,330 --> 01:21:24,160
That and a considerable sum of
 money in any currency you name.

949
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:25,910
-Where's my boat?

950
01:21:25,910 --> 01:21:28,110
-Your contact had an accident.

951
01:21:28,110 --> 01:21:34,370
You can have this boat if
 you agree to my request.

952
01:21:34,370 --> 01:21:36,380
The girl will be
 returned to you.

953
01:21:36,380 --> 01:21:38,500
You have my word.

954
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:42,050
-Who are you?

955
01:21:42,050 --> 01:21:44,930
Just a businessman.

956
01:21:44,930 --> 01:21:47,750
-Let the girl go now.

957
01:21:47,750 --> 01:21:49,530
-I cannot do that Mr. Trevor.

958
01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:55,340
I have invested a
 large sum in you.

959
01:21:55,340 --> 01:22:00,070
If I want to do one more
 to get what I want, I will.

960
01:22:00,070 --> 01:22:04,400
-You've been following me for
 some time now, haven't you?

961
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:07,100
-Do not use the word following.

962
01:22:07,100 --> 01:22:09,700
Investigate is a better word.

963
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:13,190
It started from Mr.
 Wagner, and, uh--

964
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:02,590
- I want to get on that wharf
 is wasting.

965
01:23:02,590 --> 01:23:03,590
-All right.

966
01:23:03,590 --> 01:23:07,580
For the first time, men, keep
 your fire above their heads.

967
01:23:07,580 --> 01:23:09,580
, you
 tell the chopper

968
01:23:09,580 --> 01:23:13,070
to stop that boat at
 the end of the wharf.

969
01:23:13,070 --> 01:23:14,570
OK, Lassiter, it's your show.

970
01:23:20,060 --> 01:23:21,050
-Aah, ah.

971
01:23:21,050 --> 01:23:22,050
Mr. Trevor, please.

972
01:23:22,050 --> 01:23:24,050
I did not do anything.

973
01:23:24,050 --> 01:23:26,040
I left her back there.

974
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:28,040
I left her back there.

975
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:29,540
Mr. Trevor, please, please.

976
01:23:29,540 --> 01:23:32,030
I keep.

977
01:23:32,030 --> 01:23:33,530
Please.

978
01:23:38,820 --> 01:23:39,520
Aah.

979
01:23:51,490 --> 01:23:56,480
-And this is for an old friend.

980
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:58,980
And this is for the sailor.

981
01:24:59,090 --> 01:25:00,690
-John, you've got to
 come back with me.

982
01:25:00,690 --> 01:25:03,010
-I'm not going back, Frank.

983
01:25:03,010 --> 01:25:05,470
-I'll have to take ya.

984
01:25:08,910 --> 01:25:11,860
-I'm going around you.

985
01:25:11,860 --> 01:25:16,250
If you think you can take
 me, go ahead and try.

986
01:25:16,250 --> 01:25:17,420
Otherwise, step aside.

987
01:26:15,020 --> 01:26:19,010
-You know what I have to do.

988
01:26:19,010 --> 01:26:21,000
You taught me.

989
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
Priority one and all that.

990
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,990
-Well, that's your
 problem, isn't it, Frank?

991
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:53,940
-John.

992
01:28:02,300 --> 01:28:03,800
-What's wrong, Frank?

993
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:06,290
-Come back, John.

994
01:28:06,290 --> 01:28:07,790
-What's the matter?

995
01:28:12,810 --> 01:28:13,720
Need some help?

996
01:28:18,700 --> 01:28:19,400
-Ye-aagh.

997
01:29:09,700 --> 01:29:12,190
-Now they're going
 to come after you.

998
01:30:12,020 --> 01:30:13,310
-Your briefcase, Mr. Lassiter.

999
01:30:42,890 --> 01:30:44,760
Now they're
 going to come after you.
