1
00:00:29,377 --> 00:00:29,899
I've always believed

2
00:00:29,942 --> 00:00:32,510
in the hope of Christmas.

3
00:00:32,554 --> 00:00:36,079
No matter how hard
life is...

4
00:00:36,123 --> 00:00:38,560
No matter how much
we've messed up...

5
00:00:38,603 --> 00:00:39,561
What time is it mama?

6
00:00:39,604 --> 00:00:41,084
9:30.

7
00:00:44,174 --> 00:00:45,088
Or how broken our lives have become.

8
00:00:46,785 --> 00:00:49,136
At Christmas...

9
00:00:49,179 --> 00:00:50,485
Good things can happen.

10
00:00:52,835 --> 00:00:54,054
He'll be here baby.

11
00:01:01,974 --> 00:01:03,280
Mason.

12
00:01:03,324 --> 00:01:05,543
Wha-

13
00:01:15,814 --> 00:01:16,946
Oh brother.

14
00:01:19,122 --> 00:01:20,210
Good morning,
smoky mountains

15
00:01:20,254 --> 00:01:22,430
and happy December.

16
00:01:22,473 --> 00:01:24,084
That's 600 hours...

17
00:01:24,127 --> 00:01:26,521
3,600 minutes...

18
00:01:26,564 --> 00:01:29,741
Or 25 days until Christmas.

19
00:01:29,785 --> 00:01:31,526
And the highs today are gonna
be in the mid 30's,

20
00:01:31,569 --> 00:01:33,832
so hey, put on your Grandmama's
sweater...

21
00:01:33,876 --> 00:01:35,965
Break out your aunt Edna's
fruitcake...

22
00:01:36,008 --> 00:01:38,228
And pour yourself another cup
of that eggnog latte.

23
00:01:38,272 --> 00:01:39,925
Whatever you do,
button up tight

24
00:01:39,969 --> 00:01:41,797
as you start your day today.

25
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,062
Hi, I'm Dj Baley and we are
WMTN 93.7

26
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:49,587
and this is your Tennessee
mountain Christmas station.

27
00:01:49,631 --> 00:01:52,503
Up next, we've got a new
Christmas song from Mason Wyatt

28
00:01:52,547 --> 00:01:55,027
to kick off our commercial free
Christmas marathon.

29
00:01:55,071 --> 00:01:57,160
It's Mason Wyatt, with
"o come all ye faithful."

30
00:02:06,169 --> 00:02:07,475
It's
crooked.

31
00:02:09,694 --> 00:02:14,308
<i> o come all ye faithful

32
00:02:14,351 --> 00:02:18,050
<i> joyful and triumphant

33
00:02:18,094 --> 00:02:21,924
<i> o come ye, o come ye

34
00:02:21,967 --> 00:02:24,840

35
00:02:26,711 --> 00:02:30,889

36

<i> Christ the lord

41
00:03:05,663 --> 00:03:07,926
Orders are
ready!

42
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:09,537
Pies are on the
table, hun.

43
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,887
BlackBerry crumb?Three in the bottom.

44
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,628
That smells good.Mm-hmm.

45
00:03:22,941 --> 00:03:27,119
<i> come and behold him

46
00:03:27,163 --> 00:03:31,036

47
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,953
<i> o come, let us adore him

48
00:03:34,997 --> 00:03:39,306
<i> o come, let us adore him

49
00:03:39,349 --> 00:03:43,701
<i> o come, let us adore him

50
00:03:43,745 --> 00:03:46,051
<i> Christ the lord

51
00:03:50,273 --> 00:03:53,015
Oh!

52
00:03:53,058 --> 00:03:55,322
Who died?

53
00:03:55,365 --> 00:03:57,367
Jimmy Wade
Haygood.

54
00:03:57,411 --> 00:03:58,934
You look nice, shug.

55
00:03:58,977 --> 00:04:00,457
Thank you.

56
00:04:00,501 --> 00:04:00,892
And try not to
burn this place down

57
00:04:00,936 --> 00:04:01,458
while I'm gone.

58
00:04:01,502 --> 00:04:02,764
No promises.

59
00:04:04,505 --> 00:04:06,289
Good luck, dear.

60
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:07,377
Thank you...

61
00:04:07,421 --> 00:04:08,813
Mama.

62
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,430
You're welcome!

63
00:04:16,473 --> 00:04:17,866
That's right,
Trish Greene.

64
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:20,085
It's Mason Wyatt day
down in pine valley.

65
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:21,217
Why don't you remind our
listeners,

66
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,872
why today is so special?

67
00:04:23,915 --> 00:04:26,875
Well, our very own
country music superstar,

68
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:30,748
Mason Wyatt will be dancin'
live on TV

69
00:04:30,792 --> 00:04:33,360
to raise money for
the Nashville children's home.

70
00:04:33,403 --> 00:04:34,926
Ah, does it get any better
than that, people?

71
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:37,277
That's right, Trish.

72
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,496
Now hey, he'll be dancing on
the hit show "dancin' country,"

73
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,977
so come on out everybody for a
local viewing

74
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,240
at the Holly theater, to
support our local legend.

75
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,894
The one, the only...

76
00:04:45,937 --> 00:04:48,418
Mason Wyatt!

77
00:04:48,462 --> 00:04:50,942
Oh, I cannot wait
to see this.

78
00:04:50,986 --> 00:04:53,858
We'll have gifts,
prizes and lots of fun, folks.

79
00:04:53,902 --> 00:04:56,818
So come on out everybody and
support Mason Wyatt.

80
00:04:56,861 --> 00:04:57,949
People, trust me, you
don't want to miss this.

81
00:05:16,141 --> 00:05:18,448
Ha-ha.
Shelby Haygood,
how's life?

82
00:05:18,492 --> 00:05:19,580
I am doing good,
mayor.

83
00:05:19,623 --> 00:05:20,972
How are you?

84
00:05:21,016 --> 00:05:23,192
I'm alive,
so I'm smiling.

85
00:05:23,235 --> 00:05:24,411
BlackBerry
crumb.

86
00:05:24,454 --> 00:05:25,934
Hmm, I think we'll
put this one

87
00:05:25,977 --> 00:05:27,327
under the counter.

88
00:05:30,373 --> 00:05:32,332
So uh, you comin' tonight?

89
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:33,855
Well...

90
00:05:33,898 --> 00:05:34,986
50/50.

91
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,727
50/50?

92
00:05:36,771 --> 00:05:38,599
Okay.

93
00:05:38,642 --> 00:05:40,383
Thank you.Mm-hmm.

94
00:05:40,427 --> 00:05:42,124
This is for you.Thank you.

95
00:05:42,167 --> 00:05:43,517
All right,

96
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,431
merry December.

97
00:05:44,474 --> 00:05:45,562
Ha!
Merry December.

98
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,652
Your little fella

99
00:05:48,696 --> 00:05:49,479
is falling asleep
over there.

100
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,961
Come on, fella,
it's Christmas.

101
00:05:53,004 --> 00:05:54,702
You got to stand on
your own two feet.

102
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,182
Better!

103
00:06:15,853 --> 00:06:17,115
Miss Shelby!

104
00:06:17,159 --> 00:06:18,987
Shh.

105
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:21,119
Okay,

106
00:06:21,163 --> 00:06:22,556
now you can't tell
anyone, all right?

107
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:25,297
Look what I brought.

108
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:30,825
You don't like pie,
do you?

109
00:06:30,868 --> 00:06:32,043
No, I do.

110
00:06:32,087 --> 00:06:33,175
You do, I know you do.

111
00:06:35,873 --> 00:06:36,874
It's our secret, okay?Okay.

112
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:38,398
Okay.

113
00:06:41,052 --> 00:06:42,140
M'm, what kind of pie
do you like?

114
00:06:42,184 --> 00:06:44,360
Cherry.

115
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,970
It's your lucky day.

116
00:06:46,014 --> 00:06:48,843
High-five.

117
00:06:48,886 --> 00:06:50,801
This is my favorite
time of the year all.

118
00:06:50,845 --> 00:06:53,108
The cocoa, the lights,
the trees, all the presents.

119
00:06:53,151 --> 00:06:54,544
But let's not forget why

120
00:06:54,588 --> 00:06:56,938
we celebrate
this wonderful season.

121
00:06:56,981 --> 00:06:58,766
"And she brought forth her
first born son;

122
00:06:58,809 --> 00:07:00,811
and wrapped him
in swaddling clothes,

123
00:07:00,855 --> 00:07:02,726
and laid him in a manger,

124
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:05,599
because there was no room
for them in the inn.

125
00:07:05,642 --> 00:07:07,775
And there were
in the same country,

126
00:07:07,818 --> 00:07:09,864
Shepherds abiding in the field,

127
00:07:09,907 --> 00:07:12,475
keeping watch over their flock
by night.

128
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:15,739
And lo, the angel of the lord
came upon them,

129
00:07:15,783 --> 00:07:17,480
and the glory of the lord shone
round about them,

130
00:07:17,524 --> 00:07:19,569
and they were sore afraid.

131
00:07:19,613 --> 00:07:22,050
And the angel said unto them,

132
00:07:22,093 --> 00:07:25,706
'fear not, for behold I bring
you good tidings of great joy

133
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:28,752
which shall be to all people.

134
00:07:28,796 --> 00:07:32,713
For unto you is born this day
in the city of David,

135
00:07:32,756 --> 00:07:36,412
a savior, which is Christ
the lord.

136
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,806
And this shall be a sign
unto you...

137
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:40,938
Ye shall find the babe wrapped
in swaddling clothes

138
00:07:40,982 --> 00:07:43,114
lying in a manger.'

139
00:07:43,158 --> 00:07:45,377
and suddenly, there was with
the angel

140
00:07:45,421 --> 00:07:47,815
a multitude of the heavenly
host

141
00:07:47,858 --> 00:07:50,774
praising god and saying 'glory
to god in the highest,

142
00:07:50,818 --> 00:07:54,256
and on earth peace, good will
toward men.'"

143
00:08:10,272 --> 00:08:11,795
So... what do you think?

144
00:08:19,368 --> 00:08:21,022
Stink, stank, stunk.

145
00:08:22,893 --> 00:08:24,286
Just...

146
00:08:24,329 --> 00:08:25,417
That's how it goes.

147
00:08:27,811 --> 00:08:29,160
So this would
really allow us

148
00:08:29,204 --> 00:08:31,075
to do some things,
you know?

149
00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:32,947
Create twice
the inventory,

150
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,122
generate some revenue.

151
00:08:34,165 --> 00:08:35,863
Maybe create some jobs.

152
00:08:38,692 --> 00:08:39,475
Okay your silence
is killing me,

153
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,868
Mr. Robertson.

154
00:08:40,911 --> 00:08:42,130
I don't know what
to say, Shelby.

155
00:08:42,173 --> 00:08:43,697
Well say "yes."

156
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,394
That'll make us both
feel better.

157
00:08:45,437 --> 00:08:46,700
I thought this meeting
was in reference

158
00:08:46,743 --> 00:08:48,353
to a letter you received

159
00:08:48,397 --> 00:08:50,617
about bringing your
accounts current, not...

160
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:53,315
Buying more land.

161
00:08:53,358 --> 00:08:55,535
Now loaning you additional
money at this point...

162
00:08:55,578 --> 00:08:57,667
Would be impossible.

163
00:08:57,711 --> 00:08:59,234
Look, I know we're not

164
00:08:59,277 --> 00:09:00,322
breaking the bank lately.

165
00:09:00,365 --> 00:09:01,845
But that letter,

166
00:09:01,889 --> 00:09:03,281
we thought it
was a notice,

167
00:09:03,325 --> 00:09:05,588
just like all the others.

168
00:09:05,632 --> 00:09:06,981
You have always worked
with us in the past.

169
00:09:07,024 --> 00:09:08,373
I'm sorry...

170
00:09:08,417 --> 00:09:10,114
But no.

171
00:09:10,158 --> 00:09:11,768
We've been generous
in the past,

172
00:09:11,812 --> 00:09:14,162
but with the takeover our
policies have changed.

173
00:09:14,205 --> 00:09:15,467
That farm has been
in my family

174
00:09:15,511 --> 00:09:17,600
for 40 years.

175
00:09:17,644 --> 00:09:18,688
Longer than this bank
has been here.

176
00:09:18,732 --> 00:09:20,037
I understand.

177
00:09:20,081 --> 00:09:21,648
But now may be
the time for you

178
00:09:21,691 --> 00:09:24,172
to try to find a way
to make sure that

179
00:09:24,215 --> 00:09:26,087
your house and land
avoids foreclosure.

180
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:30,570
Hold on.

181
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,280
Certain interests are doing
everything they can

182
00:09:45,323 --> 00:09:47,238
to convince the county
commission to allow

183
00:09:47,282 --> 00:09:50,633
unprecedented development
in that area.

184
00:09:50,677 --> 00:09:52,374
Now your property,
and the adjoining land,

185
00:09:52,417 --> 00:09:53,810
would finally make
that happen.

186
00:09:55,943 --> 00:09:57,988
Ralph Baxter.

187
00:09:58,032 --> 00:09:59,120
He has been trying to build

188
00:09:59,163 --> 00:10:00,382
that tourist trap
for years.

189
00:10:00,425 --> 00:10:01,905
It's not gonna happen.

190
00:10:01,949 --> 00:10:03,690
The town's not gonna
go for it.

191
00:10:03,733 --> 00:10:04,995
It would change
who we are.

192
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:06,649
Look outside.

193
00:10:06,693 --> 00:10:08,869
A lot has changed
over the years.

194
00:10:08,912 --> 00:10:10,044
Well I'm not
agreeing to it.

195
00:10:10,087 --> 00:10:11,611
It's our land,
it's our crop.

196
00:10:11,654 --> 00:10:13,917
And it's certainly not his.

197
00:10:13,961 --> 00:10:15,963
For now...

198
00:10:16,006 --> 00:10:17,094
Until the bank has
to foreclose on you

199
00:10:17,138 --> 00:10:19,531
for non-payment.

200
00:10:19,575 --> 00:10:23,100
Then it goes to
the highest bidder.

201
00:10:23,144 --> 00:10:24,580
And we both know
who that is.

202
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,839
All right,
all right folks.

203
00:11:05,882 --> 00:11:07,492
Everybody settle down just a
little bit, if you would.

204
00:11:07,536 --> 00:11:10,147
Again, I'm Dj Baley,
I'm your host tonight.

205
00:11:10,191 --> 00:11:13,455
Please, listen to my radio show
on WMTN, that's 93.7.

206
00:11:13,498 --> 00:11:14,891
#1 on the dial,

207
00:11:14,935 --> 00:11:16,501
#1 in your hearts,
if you would.

208
00:11:16,545 --> 00:11:17,415
Thank you for
your support.

209
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:19,504
But look a here.

210
00:11:19,548 --> 00:11:21,158
I have got the grand prize
right here in my hand...

211
00:11:21,202 --> 00:11:22,899
The big one.

212
00:11:22,943 --> 00:11:24,814
This is a Mason Wyatt
autographed CD

213
00:11:24,858 --> 00:11:26,555
and two tickets

214
00:11:26,598 --> 00:11:28,122
to see him over
in Knoxville,

215
00:11:28,165 --> 00:11:29,558
at the Knoxville center
for the arts.

216
00:11:29,601 --> 00:11:31,168
Gonna be a live concert,

217
00:11:31,212 --> 00:11:32,648
get to see the boy
in person.

218
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:33,605
Are we ready?

219
00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:35,042
Get your tickets out.

220
00:11:35,085 --> 00:11:36,347
Who wants some of this
right here, huh?

221
00:11:36,391 --> 00:11:37,784
Yeah, yeah!

222
00:11:37,827 --> 00:11:39,742
All right.

223
00:11:39,786 --> 00:11:40,961
Here we go.

224
00:11:41,004 --> 00:11:41,831
I'm gonna stir it
up good,

225
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,615
make sure it's fair.

226
00:11:43,659 --> 00:11:44,965
Fair for everybody.

227
00:11:47,184 --> 00:11:49,056
And there it is
right there.

228
00:11:49,099 --> 00:11:50,405
Ready?

229
00:11:50,448 --> 00:11:51,885
Excited?

230
00:11:51,928 --> 00:11:53,060
Here it is.

231
00:11:53,103 --> 00:11:57,586
1-5-3-4-2-7.

232
00:11:57,629 --> 00:11:59,240
Got it!

233
00:11:59,283 --> 00:12:00,284
Oh, miss Donna,
Donna Clark.

234
00:12:00,328 --> 00:12:02,025
Come on up, Donna.

235
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:02,983
Come on up, Donna
and get your prize.

236
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,295
Hey.hey...

237
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:12,688
Didn't expect on seeing
your face here tonight.

238
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:16,431
Yeah, well, that makes
two of us.

239
00:12:16,474 --> 00:12:18,215
I heard you
on the radio.

240
00:12:18,259 --> 00:12:21,523
Oh, I sound like
Minnie Pearl.

241
00:12:21,566 --> 00:12:23,481
I did.

242
00:12:23,525 --> 00:12:26,093
It's so bad.

243
00:12:26,136 --> 00:12:27,355
Are you nervous?

244
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,751
I am not the one
dancing.

245
00:12:31,794 --> 00:12:33,187
All right,
everyone,

246
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:34,492
if you would please
take your places;

247
00:12:34,536 --> 00:12:37,191
the show's about
to start.

248
00:12:37,234 --> 00:12:39,715
All right now, let's hear it
for "dancin' country,"

249
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,762
the number one show in America!

250
00:12:42,805 --> 00:12:44,198
It's time for
"dancin' country",

251
00:12:44,241 --> 00:12:46,113
a one night
only special

252
00:12:46,156 --> 00:12:48,376
to benefit children
around the world.

253
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:49,856
Tonight, your favorite country
music celebrities

254
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:51,161
will dance the night away.

255
00:12:51,205 --> 00:12:53,642
And all for a good cause.

256
00:12:53,685 --> 00:12:55,862
Tonight's show features
Charlie Wilkins, Mabel rimes,

257
00:12:55,905 --> 00:12:57,646
Mason Wyatt and Shelly hunter.

258
00:13:02,042 --> 00:13:03,391
Let's hear a little from our
first dancer, Mason Wyatt.

259
00:13:07,047 --> 00:13:08,265
Come on.

260
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:13,836
I'm not perfect,
you know.

261
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,663
I don't claim to be.

262
00:13:14,706 --> 00:13:16,534
Uh, but I do hope

263
00:13:16,578 --> 00:13:19,102
my mistakes
don't define me.

264
00:13:19,146 --> 00:13:21,061
I hope people give me
another chance, you know?

265
00:13:21,104 --> 00:13:23,106
Can you give me
a sec?

266
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,368
Um, I'm doing this
because I want to show

267
00:13:24,412 --> 00:13:25,282
people that I haven't
forgotten

268
00:13:25,326 --> 00:13:26,501
where I came from.

269
00:13:29,591 --> 00:13:32,637
I feel like I’m
misunderstood, you know?

270
00:13:32,681 --> 00:13:33,682
More than anything.

271
00:13:33,725 --> 00:13:37,251
I don't think

272
00:13:37,294 --> 00:13:39,427
the bad boy thing,
that's not me.

273
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:40,776
I'm a good man.

274
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,865
I'm ready to go.

275
00:13:42,909 --> 00:13:44,693
Let's dance
our faces off.

276
00:13:44,736 --> 00:13:47,348
Oh my gosh.

277
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,872
You know, small town boy,
small town values.

278
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:51,569
I'm here to work.

279
00:13:51,613 --> 00:13:52,962
Where's Mason? I work hard.

280
00:13:53,006 --> 00:13:54,224
You know, that's
what I do.

281
00:13:54,268 --> 00:13:55,791
Always.

282
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,575
I don't do anything
halfway.

283
00:13:57,619 --> 00:13:58,794
Again, seriously?I'm excited.

284
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:02,537
It'll be fun;
I hope.

285
00:14:04,278 --> 00:14:07,150
Are we done?

286
00:14:07,194 --> 00:14:09,631
Up first, we have
Mason Wyatt and Lana Parker,

287
00:14:09,674 --> 00:14:10,458
dancing for the Nashville
children's home.

288
00:14:50,106 --> 00:14:52,761
Where's she going?

289
00:14:52,804 --> 00:14:55,372
I don't know.

290
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:56,286
What is that?

291
00:15:03,337 --> 00:15:06,079
A chicken dances
better than that.

292
00:15:06,122 --> 00:15:08,081
He looks like
an idiot.

293
00:15:08,124 --> 00:15:09,212
You used to date
him.

294
00:15:15,001 --> 00:15:16,916
It's awful.

295
00:15:18,482 --> 00:15:20,397
No, no, no, not
the Macarena!

296
00:15:20,441 --> 00:15:21,703
This couldn't get
any worse.

297
00:15:21,746 --> 00:15:22,356
It just did.

298
00:15:24,488 --> 00:15:25,446
Oh, this is bad.

299
00:15:25,489 --> 00:15:26,969
This is so bad.

300
00:15:32,801 --> 00:15:34,281
This is so bad.

301
00:15:36,848 --> 00:15:40,417
Oh wow, don't do
that to Travolta.

302
00:15:40,461 --> 00:15:43,551
Oh my word.

303
00:15:43,594 --> 00:15:46,075
Is that
the cabbage patch?

304
00:15:46,119 --> 00:15:50,297
I think it's
the tootsie roll.

305
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,864
I believe the young
folks call that
the Dougie.

306
00:16:02,091 --> 00:16:03,527
Huh.oh.

307
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,620
We have that there...

308
00:16:09,664 --> 00:16:12,493
Not to mention that.

309
00:16:12,536 --> 00:16:14,364
Good evening
ladies.

310
00:16:14,408 --> 00:16:15,670
It's too late
for coffee, daddy.

311
00:16:17,846 --> 00:16:21,110
Oh, it's never
too late for coffee.

312
00:16:21,154 --> 00:16:25,375
Unlike your mama,
I can always go to sleep

313
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:26,855
and wake up whenever
I need to.

314
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,994
What are y'all
working on?

315
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:37,997
We're in trouble,
daddy.

316
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,869
Eh, we've been there before.But not like this.

317
00:16:40,912 --> 00:16:42,784
We might lose
the house.

318
00:16:42,827 --> 00:16:43,915
We been there
before too.

319
00:16:45,613 --> 00:16:46,962
It's winter;

320
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,530
I don't know
what to do.

321
00:16:49,573 --> 00:16:50,531
Take a look at that.

322
00:16:55,579 --> 00:16:57,886
As far as I know...

323
00:16:57,929 --> 00:17:02,760
A child was born
in that manger.

324
00:17:02,804 --> 00:17:06,025
Everything's gonna
be all right.

325
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:09,158
You're a strong woman,
Shelby belle.

326
00:17:09,202 --> 00:17:13,075
We raised you that way.

327
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,338
But there's some things,
strong just don't fix.

328
00:17:17,601 --> 00:17:18,907
You need a good dose
of hope.

329
00:17:21,431 --> 00:17:22,911
And you're not gonna
get that

330
00:17:22,954 --> 00:17:24,217
rooting through
them papers

331
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:27,133
in the middle
of the night.

332
00:17:27,176 --> 00:17:28,308
Now the sun will
come up tomorrow,

333
00:17:28,351 --> 00:17:29,613
I promise you,

334
00:17:29,657 --> 00:17:32,747
just like it always does.

335
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,357
But what you need
tonight...

336
00:17:36,316 --> 00:17:38,448
Is a good night's sleep.

337
00:17:39,754 --> 00:17:40,320
Good night honey.

338
00:17:40,363 --> 00:17:41,408
You too.

339
00:17:44,628 --> 00:17:45,977
I'm gonna start mine
right now.

340
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,027
He's right.

341
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,725
We're fighters,
we'll make it.

342
00:19:02,532 --> 00:19:04,360
Howdy brother bud.

343
00:19:04,404 --> 00:19:05,796
Nine letter word

344
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,320
for a popular
Christmas dessert.

345
00:19:11,672 --> 00:19:13,500
Fruitcake.no, no.

346
00:19:13,543 --> 00:19:14,240
Doesn't fit,
tried it.

347
00:19:14,283 --> 00:19:15,719
Mm.

348
00:19:17,634 --> 00:19:19,506
Mincemeat.

349
00:19:19,549 --> 00:19:20,637
Huh.

350
00:19:21,682 --> 00:19:23,901
That'll be.

351
00:19:23,945 --> 00:19:25,251
Mason Wyatt?

352
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,994
In the flesh,
Mr. Haygood.

353
00:19:30,038 --> 00:19:31,518
Good morning, sir.

354
00:19:31,561 --> 00:19:33,259
I thought my eyesight
was failing me,

355
00:19:33,302 --> 00:19:36,305
but my ears were
shooting 20/20.

356
00:19:36,349 --> 00:19:37,219
It seems like
they are.

357
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:42,485
It's good to see you, son.Good to see you.

358
00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:46,054
Um, you watched
it then, I guess.

359
00:19:46,097 --> 00:19:47,447
Watched what?

360
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:49,231
You didn't see it?

361
00:19:49,275 --> 00:19:51,015
See what?

362
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:53,017
Eight letter word
for a seventies icon.

363
00:19:59,154 --> 00:20:01,591
Travolta.

364
00:20:01,635 --> 00:20:03,767
Bam.

365
00:20:03,811 --> 00:20:05,421
Ha ha!
That'll work.

366
00:20:05,465 --> 00:20:06,553
You didn't see it,
huh?

367
00:20:06,596 --> 00:20:07,771
Thanks for that.

368
00:20:11,949 --> 00:20:14,343
Oh yeah, we saw it.

369
00:20:14,387 --> 00:20:16,780
We all saw it.

370
00:20:16,824 --> 00:20:19,522
I wasn't me.

371
00:20:19,566 --> 00:20:21,307
Well it sure looked
like you,

372
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,222
sounded like you,

373
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:24,745
strutted like a rooster
like you.

374
00:20:27,617 --> 00:20:29,445
I don't know what
I was thinking.

375
00:20:29,489 --> 00:20:31,099
Did the interview rounds
this morning...

376
00:20:31,142 --> 00:20:32,274
Went looking
for somewhere

377
00:20:32,318 --> 00:20:34,058
to Bury my head
in the sand.

378
00:20:34,102 --> 00:20:35,321
Pine valley seemed like
the place, so...

379
00:20:37,671 --> 00:20:39,542
Um...

380
00:20:39,586 --> 00:20:41,718
Oh, go ahead, ask me;
Get it over with.

381
00:20:44,547 --> 00:20:46,114
You saw me coming
from a mile away.

382
00:20:46,157 --> 00:20:48,551
Oh, before you ever
came around the corner.

383
00:20:48,595 --> 00:20:50,336
How is she?

384
00:20:50,379 --> 00:20:52,816
Oh, she's Shelby.

385
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,035
Still got that fire?

386
00:20:56,646 --> 00:20:57,865
Any chance she hates
me any less

387
00:20:57,908 --> 00:20:59,519
after all these years?

388
00:20:59,562 --> 00:21:04,480
Well, like I said,
she's still Shelby.

389
00:21:04,524 --> 00:21:05,351
I can't blame her
if she does I guess.

390
00:21:07,614 --> 00:21:10,269
She'll talk to you.

391
00:21:10,312 --> 00:21:11,879
I doubt it's what you
want to hear,

392
00:21:11,922 --> 00:21:13,707
but she's got some things
she wants to say to you.

393
00:21:15,752 --> 00:21:16,884
You know, I tried
to reach out

394
00:21:16,927 --> 00:21:18,886
to that girl
like 100 times

395
00:21:18,929 --> 00:21:19,756
over the years
and nothing.

396
00:21:21,671 --> 00:21:24,370
That first year...

397
00:21:24,413 --> 00:21:26,110
Burning all those
photographs

398
00:21:26,154 --> 00:21:27,634
sure did keep
the house warm.

399
00:21:31,072 --> 00:21:32,595
Great.

400
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,429
Lord, we thank you
for this food,

401
00:21:40,473 --> 00:21:41,952
for the nourishment
of our bodies

402
00:21:41,996 --> 00:21:45,347
and for your provision
for us.

403
00:21:45,391 --> 00:21:47,175
And please lord,

404
00:21:47,218 --> 00:21:49,786
make sure we
take the time

405
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:55,705
to think of you
and your life,

406
00:21:55,749 --> 00:21:59,709
during this
holiday season.

407
00:21:59,753 --> 00:22:02,843
In Jesus' name
we pray, amen.

408
00:22:02,886 --> 00:22:04,192
Amen to that.

409
00:22:07,108 --> 00:22:08,457
I'll get it.

410
00:22:11,852 --> 00:22:13,767
Is the gun case locked?

411
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:16,683
Always, why?Oh, no reason.

412
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:21,557
Hey, Shelby belle,
it's good to see you.

413
00:22:21,601 --> 00:22:22,602
Hey!

414
00:22:22,645 --> 00:22:23,820
Don't call
me that.

415
00:22:23,864 --> 00:22:25,387
Um...

416
00:22:25,431 --> 00:22:27,302
Let the man in...
Will ya?

417
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:30,305
He's gonna freeze
to death out there.

418
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,611
Daddy, will you
explain to me why

419
00:22:31,654 --> 00:22:33,656
you're not surprised
that Mason Wyatt

420
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,571
is at our front door?

421
00:22:35,615 --> 00:22:37,878
Because I asked him
to dinner.

422
00:22:37,921 --> 00:22:40,750
Hey! Stop that!

423
00:22:40,794 --> 00:22:42,622
Shelby, the world is

424
00:22:42,665 --> 00:22:44,754
gonna keep spinning around.

425
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:46,713
Let the man in before
he freezes to death.

426
00:22:50,107 --> 00:22:51,979
Thank y'all again for
inviting me tonight.

427
00:22:52,022 --> 00:22:53,807
It's been a long time
since I sat down

428
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:55,286
for a home cooked meal.

429
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:57,941
Everything looks
incredible ma'am,

430
00:22:57,985 --> 00:23:00,204
thank you.You're welcome.

431
00:23:00,248 --> 00:23:03,033
I ran into Mason
over at bud's.

432
00:23:03,077 --> 00:23:05,427
I figured well,
it wouldn't be a bad idea

433
00:23:05,471 --> 00:23:07,429
for us to catch up over
some sweet tea.

434
00:23:07,473 --> 00:23:09,475
Yes sir, yes sir.

435
00:23:09,518 --> 00:23:10,693
I was just
running around

436
00:23:10,737 --> 00:23:11,694
just getting
some stuff together.

437
00:23:11,738 --> 00:23:12,565
It's good
to see you.

438
00:23:12,608 --> 00:23:14,305
Well for your sake,

439
00:23:14,349 --> 00:23:15,176
I hope you run better
than you dance.

440
00:23:18,527 --> 00:23:19,746
I kind of teed that
one up for you, huh?

441
00:23:25,578 --> 00:23:28,450
This is delicious.

442
00:23:28,494 --> 00:23:29,451
I'm glad
you like it.

443
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:35,196
How long you gonna be
hanging around town, son?

444
00:23:35,239 --> 00:23:36,502
You know, I’m
not really sure.

445
00:23:36,545 --> 00:23:40,157
Yeah, Mason why
are you here?

446
00:23:40,201 --> 00:23:43,813
I mean, I'm sure
there's some
selfish reason.

447
00:23:43,857 --> 00:23:46,425
But I for one, would
really like to know
why Mason Wyatt

448
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:48,427
has decided to grace
our little town with
his presence.

449
00:23:50,733 --> 00:23:52,518
And while you're at it,
you can stop with all

450
00:23:52,561 --> 00:23:56,130
the sappy Okie dokie,
yes sirs and yes ma'am's.

451
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:04,007
Oh, did you want me
to give you an answer

452
00:24:04,051 --> 00:24:04,965
or you just gonna
keep taking shots at me?

453
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:11,450
I was telling your dad
earlier I lost touch...

454
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:14,627
And I know that.

455
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:19,283
And I was thinking,
I was hoping that
spending some time

456
00:24:19,327 --> 00:24:21,895
here back in town
would help jar my
memory.

457
00:24:21,938 --> 00:24:23,331
Maybe even help me
write some new songs.

458
00:24:23,374 --> 00:24:25,855
That would show
who I really am.

459
00:24:25,899 --> 00:24:29,816
So, you're
right, Shelby.

460
00:24:29,859 --> 00:24:32,688
I'm back in town
for selfish reasons.

461
00:24:32,732 --> 00:24:35,256
And I told him we
had plenty of
room out here.

462
00:24:35,299 --> 00:24:37,084
Daddy!

463
00:24:37,127 --> 00:24:38,520
Hey, what do you
keep doing that for?

464
00:24:39,826 --> 00:24:41,044
Not in my house.

465
00:25:07,375 --> 00:25:11,161
You want honesty,
Mason, do you?

466
00:25:11,205 --> 00:25:15,383
Well honestly,
we are about to
lose everything.

467
00:25:15,426 --> 00:25:17,124
This house, the farm,
everything that we have

468
00:25:17,167 --> 00:25:19,169
spent decades working for.

469
00:25:19,213 --> 00:25:20,780
Do you know
how that feels?

470
00:25:20,823 --> 00:25:22,738
You build something
with your hands and

471
00:25:22,782 --> 00:25:23,957
have somebody come in
and take it from you?

472
00:25:26,002 --> 00:25:29,266
We need money and
we need it quick,

473
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:33,706
so yeah you
can stay here

474
00:25:33,749 --> 00:25:36,143
for a price.

475
00:25:36,186 --> 00:25:38,232
I'm thinking
$4,000 a month.

476
00:25:41,235 --> 00:25:43,237
But it's Christmas so...
I'm gonna charge you five.

477
00:25:47,807 --> 00:25:50,113
Cat got your tongue?

478
00:25:50,157 --> 00:25:52,376
I can do that.

479
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,813
Cash.

480
00:25:55,945 --> 00:25:57,294
In advance.

481
00:25:59,775 --> 00:26:01,951
Fine.great,
you can sleep in the barn.

482
00:26:05,215 --> 00:26:08,262
If you'll excuse me.

483
00:26:08,305 --> 00:26:12,005
Well, that went about
how I thought it would.

484
00:26:28,674 --> 00:26:32,939
There's usually some method
to your daddy's madness.

485
00:26:32,982 --> 00:26:34,201
I know mama.

486
00:26:41,164 --> 00:26:42,905
It's gonna be some
Christmas for sure.

487
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:51,060
Daddy I
want to see Santa!

488
00:27:51,104 --> 00:27:51,757
Okay honey, right after
we get our tree.

489
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,714
What's wrong
with you?

490
00:27:54,847 --> 00:27:56,022
You really
haven't heard?

491
00:27:56,065 --> 00:27:57,284
Heard what?

492
00:27:59,199 --> 00:28:00,417
Mason is back
in town.

493
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:04,639
Mason?mason.

494
00:28:06,554 --> 00:28:08,774
Ma'am...

495
00:28:08,817 --> 00:28:11,820
Mason Wyatt?Mason Wyatt.

496
00:28:11,864 --> 00:28:15,084
Ma'am...

497
00:28:15,128 --> 00:28:17,565
So have you seen him?Daddy, daddy...

498
00:28:17,608 --> 00:28:19,480
Yeah, you could say that.

499
00:28:19,523 --> 00:28:21,656
He slept in our
barn last night.

500
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,093
Ma'am...

501
00:28:24,137 --> 00:28:25,616
Girl, you better stop
that lying to me.

502
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,401
I wish I was.

503
00:28:27,444 --> 00:28:28,837
He sat down
for dinner
and everything.

504
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:34,016
To be a fly
on that wall.

505
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,061
I want to
see Santa!

506
00:28:36,627 --> 00:28:37,846
How'd he look?

507
00:28:39,239 --> 00:28:40,414
I didn't notice.

508
00:28:40,457 --> 00:28:41,676
Oh please.

509
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,331
Ma'am.

510
00:28:44,374 --> 00:28:45,506
Alright ladies, look at
this one, this is all yours.

511
00:28:45,549 --> 00:28:46,986
Yay!

512
00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:48,770
It's my best one.

513
00:28:48,814 --> 00:28:50,250
Bye ladies,
merry Christmas!

514
00:28:50,293 --> 00:28:51,512
Bye, merry Christmas!

515
00:28:52,295 --> 00:28:53,732
Oh...

516
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:56,735
You
didn't notice?

517
00:28:59,389 --> 00:29:01,174
I don't believe
that any longer

518
00:29:01,217 --> 00:29:04,046
than it look you
to say it.

519
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:06,179
Because Mason Wyatt's
a lot of things, but

520
00:29:08,094 --> 00:29:09,443
Hard to look at
ain't one of 'em.

521
00:29:11,358 --> 00:29:14,317
Oh... your head
must be a mess.

522
00:29:16,189 --> 00:29:19,018
It already was.

523
00:29:19,061 --> 00:29:21,890
And Mason limping back
into town is the last
thing I need.

524
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,222
It's December 3rd,

525
00:29:49,265 --> 00:29:50,658
and a brisk morning
out there.

526
00:29:50,701 --> 00:29:53,400
22 more sleeps
until Christmas.

527
00:29:53,443 --> 00:29:56,055
In honor of that, let's
give away 22 Christmas

528
00:29:56,098 --> 00:29:59,101
sprinkle donuts from
JoJo's donut factory.

529
00:29:59,145 --> 00:30:01,234
That's just two shy of two
dozen folks

530
00:30:01,277 --> 00:30:03,584
and tell you what I'll do,

531
00:30:03,627 --> 00:30:07,066
the first caller who can call
in and tell me the name of

532
00:30:07,109 --> 00:30:10,765
Rudolph's girlfriend is going
to win themselves some donuts.

533
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,506
Caller #1, you're on the air.

534
00:30:12,549 --> 00:30:15,596
Is it Clarice?

535
00:30:15,639 --> 00:30:17,728
It looks like we've
got ourselves a Rudolph fan.

536
00:30:17,772 --> 00:30:18,686
You just won darlin'.

537
00:30:18,729 --> 00:30:20,514
Yee haw!

538
00:30:20,557 --> 00:30:22,037
That's right,
that's right.

539
00:30:22,081 --> 00:30:23,560
You get 22 Christmas
sprinkle donuts...

540
00:30:23,604 --> 00:30:25,911
Cows.what?

541
00:30:25,954 --> 00:30:28,609
The cows.

542
00:30:28,652 --> 00:30:31,394
Probably blocking
the road up ahead.

543
00:30:31,438 --> 00:30:32,961
I mean, you know
it happened just
last week.

544
00:30:35,572 --> 00:30:38,488
You know I got
to say, this has...

545
00:30:38,532 --> 00:30:40,882
This has got to
be my lucky day.

546
00:30:40,926 --> 00:30:42,971
I mean running
into you way out
here like this.

547
00:30:43,015 --> 00:30:45,234
How's that?

548
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:48,455
Well, it's funny
you should ask.

549
00:30:48,498 --> 00:30:49,630
You see I got
this personal
matter I'd like

550
00:30:49,673 --> 00:30:51,632
to discuss with you.

551
00:30:51,675 --> 00:30:52,763
I mean, if you
got a minute.

552
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:59,683
Well, apparently I do.

553
00:30:59,727 --> 00:31:00,728
Well that's
just great.

554
00:31:00,771 --> 00:31:03,209
Here, let
me help you.

555
00:31:03,252 --> 00:31:04,514
Alrighty.

556
00:31:08,431 --> 00:31:11,043
You see...

557
00:31:11,086 --> 00:31:13,567
I heard about
your problems.

558
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:15,438
And it's a
terrible shame.

559
00:31:15,482 --> 00:31:16,700
Such beautiful
property.

560
00:31:21,227 --> 00:31:23,490
Have you heard that
my company is purchasing

561
00:31:23,533 --> 00:31:25,492
all the nearby
land around you?

562
00:31:25,535 --> 00:31:28,756
Yup.

563
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:29,539
Well, I'd like to
help you out as well.

564
00:31:33,326 --> 00:31:35,937
The Haygood farm deed,
I'd like to make an offer.

565
00:31:35,981 --> 00:31:38,200
Yeah?mm-hmm.

566
00:31:38,244 --> 00:31:39,462
You want to become
a farmer, do ya?

567
00:31:39,506 --> 00:31:41,421
No, no, heck no.

568
00:31:41,464 --> 00:31:45,338
I just want the land.

569
00:31:45,381 --> 00:31:46,948
You wanna
develop it?

570
00:31:46,992 --> 00:31:49,864
Yes, as a matter
of fact I do.

571
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:50,691
I think it'd help
out the town a lot.

572
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:56,305
It's not for sale.

573
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,183
Not yet.

574
00:32:05,575 --> 00:32:06,794
You have a
nice day.

575
00:32:13,583 --> 00:32:14,889
Knock knock.

576
00:32:23,593 --> 00:32:26,031
Don't worry I
come in peace.

577
00:32:26,074 --> 00:32:28,120
With cash.

578
00:32:28,163 --> 00:32:29,121
Your dad told me
all about

579
00:32:29,164 --> 00:32:31,123
the bank stuff
and times are

580
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:32,385
a little tight
for me too but...

581
00:32:32,428 --> 00:32:33,995
I hope this helps.

582
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:35,127
I'll count it later.

583
00:32:37,042 --> 00:32:38,173
I'm sure you will.

584
00:32:46,225 --> 00:32:47,139
You won't even
know I'm here.

585
00:32:52,013 --> 00:32:53,667
That ship has
sailed, Mason.

586
00:33:00,195 --> 00:33:01,544
Okay, good talk.

587
00:33:26,221 --> 00:33:27,048
Okay, you had
the strawberry,
there you go.

588
00:33:27,092 --> 00:33:28,876
Thank you so much.

589
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:30,747
Have a good day.

590
00:33:30,791 --> 00:33:32,619
Mm.right?

591
00:33:32,662 --> 00:33:34,882
Satisfied.

592
00:33:34,925 --> 00:33:36,275
I'm a buyer,
for Harrison's.

593
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:38,581
Supermarket?

594
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:40,018
Exactly.

595
00:33:40,061 --> 00:33:41,715
We come
up here every year

596
00:33:41,758 --> 00:33:43,282
to grab our tree
and on our way

597
00:33:43,325 --> 00:33:45,153
to grab breakfast we
ran into this place.

598
00:33:45,197 --> 00:33:47,112
Well great, we are
here every Saturday.

599
00:33:47,155 --> 00:33:49,114
That's what I heard.

600
00:33:49,157 --> 00:33:51,681
So I'm guessing
today is my lucky day.

601
00:33:51,725 --> 00:33:53,118
More, okay.

602
00:33:55,468 --> 00:33:57,992
Um, look, I'd love to take
several of these back

603
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,516
to the home office just to
see what the response is.

604
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:03,563
I mean we're always
looking for good product.

605
00:34:03,606 --> 00:34:07,349
Okay, all right,
well that's great.

606
00:34:07,393 --> 00:34:08,568
Just so you know
these are fresh
baked every morning.

607
00:34:08,611 --> 00:34:10,004
Really?

608
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,745
Wonderful.

609
00:34:11,788 --> 00:34:12,789
Well give me like...
Two of each.

610
00:34:15,575 --> 00:34:18,012
Okay, thank you.

611
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,057
Ready for this?Yeah, thank you.

612
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,232
Here you go sir.

613
00:34:20,275 --> 00:34:22,147
Got it, thank you.

614
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,061
You know what, let me
give you a brochure too,

615
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:24,845
you can check
out our farm.

616
00:34:24,888 --> 00:34:26,586
We'll be in
touch, really.

617
00:34:26,629 --> 00:34:28,022
Thank you.

618
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:28,979
Nice meeting
you, take care.

619
00:34:43,951 --> 00:34:46,040
You always work
this early?

620
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,128
You always
sleep this late?

621
00:34:49,957 --> 00:34:52,177
Sometimes.

622
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:54,179
Sometimes?

623
00:34:54,222 --> 00:34:54,962
Sometimes you always
sleep this late?

624
00:34:56,833 --> 00:34:57,921
You know
what I mean.

625
00:35:01,447 --> 00:35:03,579
You've expanded.

626
00:35:03,623 --> 00:35:06,104
What?

627
00:35:06,147 --> 00:35:08,323
Not... not you,
the farm.

628
00:35:08,367 --> 00:35:10,369
You've expanded
the farm.

629
00:35:10,412 --> 00:35:12,675
You look good, you
look great, Shelby.

630
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:13,937
Give me a tour?

631
00:35:16,157 --> 00:35:17,593
Sure.

632
00:35:20,901 --> 00:35:23,904
This is our farm.

633
00:35:23,947 --> 00:35:25,775
Over here is where
we grow the blackberries.

634
00:35:25,819 --> 00:35:27,690
The blueberries.

635
00:35:27,734 --> 00:35:30,693
And then up there
is the strawberries.

636
00:35:30,737 --> 00:35:32,304
Then in that house
up there is where we

637
00:35:32,347 --> 00:35:33,783
make all our jams, and our
jellies, and our pies,

638
00:35:33,827 --> 00:35:34,828
and it's also a place
where a scared,

639
00:35:34,871 --> 00:35:36,351
17 year old
version of me

640
00:35:36,395 --> 00:35:39,702
cried herself to sleep
on Christmas Eve

641
00:35:39,746 --> 00:35:41,313
and every other night
for about 6 months

642
00:35:41,356 --> 00:35:43,619
waiting for
her boyfriend to call,

643
00:35:43,663 --> 00:35:46,579
or come home, or write
like he promised...

644
00:35:46,622 --> 00:35:47,362
And I would try to
explain that to you Mason,

645
00:35:47,406 --> 00:35:48,537
I really would...

646
00:35:50,887 --> 00:35:54,021
But I just don't think
that dog will hunt.

647
00:35:54,064 --> 00:35:58,112
So finally, at the end
of our property, out there,

648
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,680
that is where
I'm about to go.

649
00:36:05,206 --> 00:36:09,123
Hey Mason...

650
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,472
That over there...

651
00:36:10,516 --> 00:36:12,387
That's the barn.

652
00:36:12,431 --> 00:36:13,606
That's where all
the animals sleep.

653
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:50,860
Baxter...

654
00:36:54,995 --> 00:36:57,127
By unanimous consent
the commission

655
00:36:57,171 --> 00:36:59,652
has approved a plan
to limit left turns

656
00:36:59,695 --> 00:37:01,088
on Wilson road
between the hours of

657
00:37:01,131 --> 00:37:04,134
7 A.M. and 9 A.M.

658
00:37:04,178 --> 00:37:07,486
So that the crossing
guards may do their job.

659
00:37:07,529 --> 00:37:09,009
All right.

660
00:37:09,052 --> 00:37:11,620
Last order of business,

661
00:37:11,664 --> 00:37:14,623
the town will hear
from Mr. Ralph Baxter.

662
00:37:18,671 --> 00:37:20,586
Good afternoon.

663
00:37:20,629 --> 00:37:23,763
Uh, just a little
clarification Mr. Baxter,

664
00:37:23,806 --> 00:37:25,373
nothing you're
presenting here today

665
00:37:25,417 --> 00:37:27,332
has officially
been submitted

666
00:37:27,375 --> 00:37:28,811
beyond here, correct?

667
00:37:28,855 --> 00:37:30,726
That is correct.

668
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:33,294
All right,
let's hear it.

669
00:37:33,338 --> 00:37:35,340
Thank you.

670
00:37:35,383 --> 00:37:37,994
Now most, if not
all of you know

671
00:37:38,038 --> 00:37:39,169
about our plan
to build

672
00:37:39,213 --> 00:37:41,259
a visitor center,
restaurant,

673
00:37:41,302 --> 00:37:45,306
and business park on
highway 49, near
the Haygood farm.

674
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:47,743
The benefits will be many,

675
00:37:47,787 --> 00:37:49,397
and they have been
detailed in the plan

676
00:37:49,441 --> 00:37:52,313
that I have submitted
through the proper channels.

677
00:37:52,357 --> 00:37:55,577
However, I think it's
important to know

678
00:37:55,621 --> 00:37:58,580
that we may only get
the one opportunity

679
00:37:58,624 --> 00:38:01,844
to take our case
to the people who

680
00:38:01,888 --> 00:38:03,237
that can make
things happen.

681
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,370
So I cannot stress to
you enough,

682
00:38:05,413 --> 00:38:07,894
the importance
of having

683
00:38:07,937 --> 00:38:09,417
the full support of
this great town.

684
00:38:16,555 --> 00:38:18,818
I think... I think
that we can all agree,

685
00:38:18,861 --> 00:38:20,167
that revenue sharing
on this property...

686
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:21,473
I don't.

687
00:38:22,517 --> 00:38:24,563
Excuse me?

688
00:38:24,606 --> 00:38:25,999
I'm sorry but I don't
agree with Mr. Baxter,

689
00:38:26,042 --> 00:38:28,523
not one little bit.

690
00:38:28,567 --> 00:38:30,830
Shelby I don't think
we're ready to discuss

691
00:38:30,873 --> 00:38:32,919
this from the floor.

692
00:38:32,962 --> 00:38:36,052
Well, I can't
sit here and
listen to this.

693
00:38:36,096 --> 00:38:39,708
No, no, Mr. Mayor,
I welcome miss Haygood's

694
00:38:39,752 --> 00:38:42,320
constructive criticism.

695
00:38:42,363 --> 00:38:44,322
After all, our goal
is to provide a service

696
00:38:44,365 --> 00:38:45,627
to this town so
you go right ahead,

697
00:38:45,671 --> 00:38:48,282
little lady,
go right ahead.

698
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,849
All right, Shelby.
Whatcha got?

699
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:57,335
We have always
preserved our
way of life.

700
00:38:58,771 --> 00:39:01,208
Our mountains.

701
00:39:01,251 --> 00:39:03,689
Developing that
kind of land,

702
00:39:03,732 --> 00:39:05,125
bringing in these
kind of stores,

703
00:39:05,168 --> 00:39:10,217
it's gonna change
who we are.

704
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:12,524
And there's something
so special about

705
00:39:12,567 --> 00:39:13,655
living off the
beaten path.

706
00:39:16,049 --> 00:39:17,877
About a simple life.

707
00:39:21,054 --> 00:39:23,056
Well said.
Well said.

708
00:39:26,233 --> 00:39:28,191
But, let me just say,
you may refuse

709
00:39:28,235 --> 00:39:31,064
to evolve Ms. Haygood...

710
00:39:31,107 --> 00:39:32,326
But that doesn't
mean the rest of us

711
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:35,895
have to grow
stagnant with you.

712
00:39:35,938 --> 00:39:38,158
I think everybody here knows
that the significant

713
00:39:38,201 --> 00:39:40,116
portion of your
business is...

714
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,597
Down the mountain.

715
00:39:42,641 --> 00:39:47,950
While the rest of us live
and work here in this town.

716
00:39:47,994 --> 00:39:50,344
And this plan
provides more revenue.

717
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,999
More jobs.

718
00:39:53,042 --> 00:39:55,610
And that is something
this town sorely needs.

719
00:39:55,654 --> 00:39:59,179
That farm...

720
00:39:59,222 --> 00:40:01,311
That is the only
home I have ever
known and I am

721
00:40:01,355 --> 00:40:03,836
not going to sit
quietly and let
him take it.

722
00:40:03,879 --> 00:40:05,359
So that's what this
is all about, huh?

723
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,448
Hm?

724
00:40:07,492 --> 00:40:09,494
That's what
this is about.

725
00:40:09,537 --> 00:40:10,886
She doesn't care
about the well-being

726
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:12,888
of the people
of this town.

727
00:40:12,932 --> 00:40:14,237
She only cares about
what's best

728
00:40:14,281 --> 00:40:16,501
for the Haygood family.

729
00:40:16,544 --> 00:40:19,765
No, no, I care more
about this town

730
00:40:19,808 --> 00:40:22,289
and these people

731
00:40:22,332 --> 00:40:23,899
than you could
ever pretend to.

732
00:40:23,943 --> 00:40:25,814
I'm sure.

733
00:40:25,858 --> 00:40:27,512
Of course you do.

734
00:40:27,555 --> 00:40:29,165
Mr. Mayor if I may,

735
00:40:29,209 --> 00:40:31,777
I'd like to submit
the full proposal.

736
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:35,345
And with the town's
support of this proposal,

737
00:40:35,389 --> 00:40:36,521
I will then
be submitting

738
00:40:36,564 --> 00:40:40,873
it to the
proper authorities.

739
00:40:40,916 --> 00:40:44,529
The town accepts the
submission of
Mr. Baxter's proposal.

740
00:40:44,572 --> 00:40:45,704
And we'll plan to put it
to a vote as soon as those

741
00:40:45,747 --> 00:40:48,446
who wish to...

742
00:40:48,489 --> 00:40:51,144
Have had a chance
to review the materials.

743
00:40:51,187 --> 00:40:52,928
Thank you Mr. Mayor.

744
00:40:55,409 --> 00:40:57,193
We are not
quitting.

745
00:40:57,237 --> 00:40:58,456
Merry Christmas.

746
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:03,373
Can you wear that
turtleneck tonight,

747
00:41:03,417 --> 00:41:04,113
the red one?

748
00:41:04,157 --> 00:41:05,593
How much?!

749
00:41:05,637 --> 00:41:07,726
How much
do we owe?

750
00:41:07,769 --> 00:41:08,378
Is someone with you?

751
00:41:12,818 --> 00:41:15,473
Sorry, Darla, this'll
only take a minute.

752
00:41:15,516 --> 00:41:15,647
Shelby?
Is that you?

753
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:18,214
Yes.

754
00:41:18,258 --> 00:41:20,303
Darla, honey, I’m
gonna have to call
you back.

755
00:41:20,347 --> 00:41:22,828
Oh Shelby
darling please, please

756
00:41:22,871 --> 00:41:24,569
erase this from
your memory.

757
00:41:24,612 --> 00:41:26,701
I will.

758
00:41:26,745 --> 00:41:28,181
Thanks.
Merry Christmas.

759
00:41:28,224 --> 00:41:30,400
Merry Christmas.

760
00:41:30,444 --> 00:41:30,966
And
Glenn honey, you better

761
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:31,706
call me when
Shelby leaves.

762
00:41:40,367 --> 00:41:46,373
$41,501 to bring your
line of credit current.

763
00:41:46,416 --> 00:41:51,334
$22,148 to bring your
second mortgage current.

764
00:41:51,378 --> 00:41:53,598
That is...

765
00:41:53,641 --> 00:41:58,428
$63,649 and...

766
00:41:58,472 --> 00:41:59,778
Both are due in 60 days.

767
00:42:12,138 --> 00:42:14,444
"About half
past ten the cracked bell

768
00:42:14,488 --> 00:42:17,230
at the small
church began to ring.

769
00:42:17,273 --> 00:42:19,275
And presently the
people began

770
00:42:19,319 --> 00:42:22,931
to gather for
the morning sermon.

771
00:42:22,975 --> 00:42:25,717
The Sunday school children
distributed themselves about

772
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,547
the house and occupied
pews with their parents,

773
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:33,159
so as to be
under supervision.

774
00:42:33,202 --> 00:42:35,553
Aunt Polly came,and Tom,

775
00:42:35,596 --> 00:42:38,338
and sid and Mary
sat with her.

776
00:42:38,381 --> 00:42:40,253
Tom being placed
next to the aisle

777
00:42:40,296 --> 00:42:42,342
in order that he
might be

778
00:42:42,385 --> 00:42:44,779
as far away from
the open window

779
00:42:44,823 --> 00:42:46,651
and the seductive

780
00:42:46,694 --> 00:42:48,740
outside summer
scenes as possible."

781
00:42:50,002 --> 00:42:51,394
Hey hun.

782
00:42:54,659 --> 00:42:58,750
Well... I told the
bank we're keeping
the land.

783
00:42:58,793 --> 00:43:00,795
That sounds about right.

784
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:01,753
You think so?

785
00:43:01,796 --> 00:43:04,059
Yup.

786
00:43:04,103 --> 00:43:05,060
Now we just gotta
figure out a way
to do that.

787
00:43:05,104 --> 00:43:06,714
And we will.

788
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:17,203
He's not here.

789
00:43:17,246 --> 00:43:19,988
That's good,
I don't care.

790
00:43:20,032 --> 00:43:21,903
You keep saying
it and you might
get an echo.

791
00:43:21,947 --> 00:43:23,905
Mm-hm.

792
00:43:29,563 --> 00:43:32,000
Can I ask you
a question?

793
00:43:32,044 --> 00:43:34,263
After all these years

794
00:43:34,307 --> 00:43:36,004
the hate that you feel

795
00:43:36,048 --> 00:43:39,617
for that fella hadn't
even abated

796
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:42,271
a little bit?

797
00:43:42,315 --> 00:43:44,709
He made a mistake
years ago,

798
00:43:44,752 --> 00:43:47,233
and he's been
trying to make up

799
00:43:47,276 --> 00:43:49,539
for it off and
on ever since.

800
00:43:49,583 --> 00:43:51,150
But would you tell me...

801
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:53,848
What has this hate
gotten you?

802
00:43:55,937 --> 00:43:57,243
You know...

803
00:44:00,463 --> 00:44:02,640
It ain't baggage if
you don't carry it around.

804
00:44:05,207 --> 00:44:09,516
I remember seeing the
two of you together,

805
00:44:09,559 --> 00:44:14,042
and I don't think I've
ever seen you happier.

806
00:44:14,086 --> 00:44:15,827
We just want
you to be happy.

807
00:44:19,004 --> 00:44:22,007
I'm happy.

808
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:25,053
This farm
makes me happy.

809
00:44:25,097 --> 00:44:27,055
This way
of life.

810
00:44:27,099 --> 00:44:28,622
I'm happy.

811
00:44:39,111 --> 00:44:42,592
Where were we?

812
00:44:42,636 --> 00:44:44,986
Well, Tom was sittin' on the
aisle away from the window...

813
00:45:13,058 --> 00:45:15,321
I'm sorry was
that too loud?
No.

814
00:45:15,364 --> 00:45:16,888
Sounds nice.

815
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:35,994
You hurt her once
when you left.

816
00:45:36,037 --> 00:45:37,473
And I didn't know if
she would get over it.

817
00:45:40,825 --> 00:45:44,132
Now you're back...

818
00:45:44,176 --> 00:45:47,701
And I know she won't,
if it happens again.

819
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:51,009
I'm asking you not
to do that.I...

820
00:45:51,052 --> 00:45:53,228
No please, just
hear my words.

821
00:46:03,978 --> 00:46:05,327
You have my word.

822
00:46:07,068 --> 00:46:08,766
Okay.

823
00:46:11,551 --> 00:46:13,074
Good.

824
00:46:20,212 --> 00:46:25,043
<i> go and tell it
on the mountain

825
00:46:25,086 --> 00:46:30,657
<i> over the hills
and everywhere

826
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:34,226
<i> go and tell it
on the mountain

827
00:46:34,269 --> 00:46:40,362
<i> that Jesus Christ
is born

828
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:52,505
<i> Go tell it on the mountain

829
00:47:13,482 --> 00:47:14,701
Well I don't
understand
because this

830
00:47:14,744 --> 00:47:16,921
says that we're
Pre-approved.

831
00:47:16,964 --> 00:47:18,923
Yes, yes sir.

832
00:47:18,966 --> 00:47:22,056
Mm-hm.

833
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:25,538
So we're Pre-qualified,
but not Pre-approved.

834
00:47:25,581 --> 00:47:29,237
I understand completely,
you can stop talking now.

835
00:47:29,281 --> 00:47:31,718
Yes, yes ma'am, I know
what debt to income ratio is.

836
00:47:31,761 --> 00:47:33,111
Thank you for
your time.

837
00:47:33,154 --> 00:47:33,676
Thank you,
okay, I understand.

838
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:35,417
Thank you.

839
00:47:35,461 --> 00:47:35,940
Thank you, thank you
for your time.

840
00:47:43,208 --> 00:47:45,210
Morning sir.

841
00:47:45,253 --> 00:47:46,951
Mornin' son.

842
00:47:46,994 --> 00:47:48,343
Sleep well?

843
00:47:48,387 --> 00:47:50,389
Yeah, short.

844
00:47:52,782 --> 00:47:54,349
Rooster.

845
00:47:55,089 --> 00:47:57,700
Yup.

846
00:47:57,744 --> 00:47:59,702
The older I get
the more I dislike
that creature.

847
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:08,015
I do miss these mountains
though.

848
00:48:09,364 --> 00:48:13,151
Mm-hm.

849
00:48:13,194 --> 00:48:14,717
How long's it
been since your
folks passed?

850
00:48:17,068 --> 00:48:18,156
12 years
for daddy and...

851
00:48:18,199 --> 00:48:20,549
9 for mama.

852
00:48:20,593 --> 00:48:23,161
Yeah, I think
that's the last
time we saw you.

853
00:48:25,815 --> 00:48:27,513
Had a girl on
each arm as
I remember.

854
00:48:28,644 --> 00:48:31,386
Yes sir.

855
00:48:31,430 --> 00:48:33,301
I expect that
picture has burned
into Shelby's mind.

856
00:48:37,218 --> 00:48:39,917
Your folks were
good people, Mason.

857
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:42,615
They were proud
of you.

858
00:48:42,658 --> 00:48:44,530
Proud of your success.

859
00:48:44,573 --> 00:48:45,966
Maybe.

860
00:48:49,361 --> 00:48:50,971
You want
some help?

861
00:48:51,015 --> 00:48:53,843
Always.
Step right up.

862
00:48:53,887 --> 00:48:55,584
All right, thank you.

863
00:48:58,370 --> 00:49:00,328
It's been awhile.

864
00:49:00,372 --> 00:49:01,242
So, don't judge
me on this alone.

865
00:49:10,338 --> 00:49:12,384
A little out of
practice, aren't you?

866
00:49:12,427 --> 00:49:14,081
Go and set it up again.

867
00:49:17,302 --> 00:49:20,044
Best decision
I ever made.

868
00:49:20,087 --> 00:49:22,872
Overhead is higher,
but profits have
nearly doubled.

869
00:49:22,916 --> 00:49:25,701
I tell ya, pick
your own is
the way to go.

870
00:49:25,745 --> 00:49:27,486
We got a petting
zoo over there,

871
00:49:27,529 --> 00:49:29,749
goats, sheep, rabbits,

872
00:49:29,792 --> 00:49:31,185
horseback riding
all day long.

873
00:49:31,229 --> 00:49:32,621
Chuck wagon rides
in the evening.

874
00:49:32,665 --> 00:49:34,972
Year round store
for the produce.

875
00:49:35,015 --> 00:49:37,931
I tell you it's been great.

876
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:39,802
Why don't you go
find your mom.

877
00:49:43,328 --> 00:49:46,244
But uh...

878
00:49:46,287 --> 00:49:47,071
You obviously
didn't come here
to talk about that.

879
00:49:49,203 --> 00:49:50,639
Well, no sir.

880
00:49:53,555 --> 00:49:55,601
You know the 50 acres
we have out back?

881
00:49:55,644 --> 00:49:57,777
Sure. It's
good land.

882
00:49:57,820 --> 00:49:59,909
Yeah, we think so.

883
00:49:59,953 --> 00:50:04,131
It's always produced
great crop for us.

884
00:50:04,175 --> 00:50:07,352
I was wondering
if you thought
about expanding?

885
00:50:07,395 --> 00:50:09,702
We could lease it to
you for a season or two.

886
00:50:09,745 --> 00:50:13,488
Well, I haven't really
considered a sublease.

887
00:50:13,532 --> 00:50:15,621
You said yourself,
it's good land.

888
00:50:15,664 --> 00:50:17,840
You won't have to put
much time into it.

889
00:50:17,884 --> 00:50:19,320
Be a lot more
inventory for
your store.

890
00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:24,717
Tell you what...

891
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,414
You bring me a proposal,
I'll think about

892
00:50:26,458 --> 00:50:27,546
it and give you
a quick decision.

893
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:30,984
All right.

894
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:32,464
Thank you sir.Sure.

895
00:50:44,606 --> 00:50:46,608
It's a start.

896
00:50:58,055 --> 00:50:59,665
Yup, I feel good.

897
00:50:59,708 --> 00:51:01,710
It's peaceful here.

898
00:51:01,754 --> 00:51:03,930
Just what I need
to recalibrate actually.

899
00:51:03,973 --> 00:51:04,844
Ready go back out...
Soon as you find some gigs.

900
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:12,895
Great.

901
00:51:12,939 --> 00:51:14,419
All right well,
make some calls,

902
00:51:14,462 --> 00:51:16,029
I want to start
as soon as possible.

903
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:17,596
Thanks man.

904
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:30,348
Mornin'.

905
00:51:30,391 --> 00:51:33,742
Morning.

906
00:51:33,786 --> 00:51:34,526
This place looks good
on you Shelby belle.

907
00:51:37,529 --> 00:51:38,921
Shelby.

908
00:51:40,009 --> 00:51:42,011
Mm-hm.

909
00:51:42,055 --> 00:51:44,840
I missed it here.

910
00:51:44,884 --> 00:51:46,233
Missed the people.

911
00:51:48,017 --> 00:51:49,062
Missed the culture.

912
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:51,891
Yeah, well that's
kind of funny because

913
00:51:51,934 --> 00:51:53,022
you've been here what?

914
00:51:53,066 --> 00:51:54,372
5 days?

915
00:51:54,415 --> 00:51:56,591
A week?

916
00:51:56,635 --> 00:51:59,028
Spent your whole time
on this farm

917
00:51:59,072 --> 00:52:00,029
licking your wounds,

918
00:52:00,073 --> 00:52:02,989
gettin' in my way.

919
00:52:03,032 --> 00:52:05,644
Haven't been out in town,
being a man of the people.

920
00:52:08,647 --> 00:52:09,952
But you always were,

921
00:52:09,996 --> 00:52:11,693
"all hat and no cattle",
Mason so

922
00:52:11,737 --> 00:52:12,346
whatever flips
your pancake.

923
00:52:14,479 --> 00:52:15,958
Okay.

924
00:52:19,179 --> 00:52:21,007
Listen I saw the note
inside from the bank.

925
00:52:23,792 --> 00:52:26,012
About how much y'all owe.

926
00:52:26,055 --> 00:52:27,492
I can't do much but I
thought maybe at least

927
00:52:27,535 --> 00:52:28,710
I could make a
few phone calls.

928
00:52:30,973 --> 00:52:32,192
No.

929
00:52:34,629 --> 00:52:36,196
No?no.

930
00:52:43,856 --> 00:52:45,423
Suit yourself.

931
00:53:01,656 --> 00:53:04,050
Wow.

932
00:53:04,093 --> 00:53:06,661
Oh yup, I called Joe son's
corner in mount olive,

933
00:53:06,705 --> 00:53:08,663
biggest order
in years.

934
00:53:10,535 --> 00:53:12,276
Good job.

935
00:53:30,337 --> 00:53:32,470
That's
Mason Wyatt.

936
00:53:32,513 --> 00:53:33,645
It's him,
it's really him!

937
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:38,345
How ya doing?

938
00:53:38,389 --> 00:53:39,781
Hi.

939
00:53:48,181 --> 00:53:50,052
How many?

940
00:53:50,096 --> 00:53:50,836
Just the one.

941
00:53:50,879 --> 00:53:51,750
Hey Mason!

942
00:53:54,013 --> 00:53:54,883
Come here, we're
just telling

943
00:53:54,927 --> 00:53:56,537
lies and chewing
the fat.

944
00:53:58,060 --> 00:53:59,018
Good to see
everybody.

945
00:53:59,061 --> 00:54:00,759
Now you know
mayor bud there.

946
00:54:00,802 --> 00:54:02,848
Of course,
the puzzle man.

947
00:54:02,891 --> 00:54:04,110
And this is
coach bullet,

948
00:54:04,153 --> 00:54:05,590
the meanest man in town

949
00:54:05,633 --> 00:54:07,548
and also tight
as dick's hat there.

950
00:54:09,289 --> 00:54:10,464
Coach I had you
for gym

951
00:54:10,508 --> 00:54:11,465
in junior high
actually.

952
00:54:11,509 --> 00:54:12,988
Yeah I remember.

953
00:54:13,032 --> 00:54:15,164
You never could
climb the rope.

954
00:54:15,208 --> 00:54:16,731
Yeah, I still can't
climb the rope.

955
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:20,039
You remember Baley?

956
00:54:20,082 --> 00:54:21,997
He's on the radio
as we speak.

957
00:54:22,041 --> 00:54:23,347
17 minute
commercial free.

958
00:54:23,390 --> 00:54:24,391
And as a matter
of fact,

959
00:54:24,435 --> 00:54:26,132
Perry Como has
two minutes and

960
00:54:26,175 --> 00:54:27,655
28 seconds
left boys.

961
00:54:27,699 --> 00:54:28,569
I've enjoyed it.

962
00:54:28,613 --> 00:54:29,614
Gotta go.

963
00:54:29,657 --> 00:54:30,658
Good to see you.

964
00:54:30,702 --> 00:54:31,920
Hey, I'd love
to have you

965
00:54:31,964 --> 00:54:32,791
on the radio
sometime son,

966
00:54:32,834 --> 00:54:33,226
come and see me,
all right.

967
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:33,966
We'll do it.

968
00:54:34,009 --> 00:54:36,273
All right Baley.

969
00:54:36,316 --> 00:54:37,056
And this is
cousin Larry
over here.

970
00:54:37,099 --> 00:54:38,275
We call him chipper

971
00:54:38,318 --> 00:54:39,232
because he's such
a big fan

972
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:40,277
of the braves.

973
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:41,800
Oh yeah, me too.

974
00:54:41,843 --> 00:54:42,975
I got to sing
the national anthem

975
00:54:43,018 --> 00:54:43,932
at Turner field
one time.

976
00:54:43,976 --> 00:54:44,846
Oh yeah?

977
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:46,848
Any slip ups?

978
00:54:46,892 --> 00:54:47,980
No, but I wrote
the lyrics on
my hand so...

979
00:54:50,461 --> 00:54:51,984
Well grab a seat
and get some
grub in you.

980
00:54:57,685 --> 00:54:59,339
Yup, it's him all right.

981
00:55:01,123 --> 00:55:02,168
Wow...

982
00:55:02,211 --> 00:55:04,126
Okay, well um...

983
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:05,737
Let me get you
a menu.

984
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:06,215
No, no, that's
all right.

985
00:55:06,259 --> 00:55:08,479
What's good?

986
00:55:08,522 --> 00:55:09,088
Oh, we're stuck
with the oatmeal
and fruit cup,

987
00:55:09,131 --> 00:55:10,829
but uh...

988
00:55:10,872 --> 00:55:12,134
If I was you I’d just

989
00:55:12,178 --> 00:55:13,353
live a little.

990
00:55:15,442 --> 00:55:17,662
I'd go for the
smoky mountain breakfast

991
00:55:17,705 --> 00:55:20,621
with a side of pancakes,
you can't lose.

992
00:55:20,665 --> 00:55:21,970
All right,
smoky mountain breakfast

993
00:55:22,014 --> 00:55:23,537
with a side
of pancakes please.

994
00:55:23,581 --> 00:55:26,932
Um, any fruit
on the pancakes?

995
00:55:29,064 --> 00:55:30,805
We can do
blueberries...

996
00:55:30,849 --> 00:55:33,112
Blackberries...

997
00:55:33,155 --> 00:55:34,809
Peaches...

998
00:55:34,853 --> 00:55:37,029
Strawberries...

999
00:55:37,072 --> 00:55:38,204
Raspberries...

1000
00:55:38,247 --> 00:55:39,640
Elderberries...

1001
00:55:39,684 --> 00:55:41,947
Boysenberries...

1002
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:43,340
You name it.

1003
00:55:43,383 --> 00:55:45,342
Um, blueberries.

1004
00:55:48,301 --> 00:55:50,521
And how would you
like your eggs?

1005
00:55:50,564 --> 00:55:53,219
Fried.

1006
00:55:53,262 --> 00:55:55,221
Medium, so that
the yolk is running

1007
00:55:55,264 --> 00:55:56,875
and nothing else.

1008
00:55:56,918 --> 00:55:58,398
Got it.

1009
00:56:02,228 --> 00:56:03,882
Ham, bacon,
or sausage?

1010
00:56:03,925 --> 00:56:05,274
Bring him a little
of all three

1011
00:56:05,318 --> 00:56:06,667
so we can
all have a whiff.

1012
00:56:09,235 --> 00:56:10,889
Biscuits and gravy
or grits?

1013
00:56:12,586 --> 00:56:13,892
Grits.

1014
00:56:13,935 --> 00:56:15,981
Oh, that's fancy.

1015
00:56:16,024 --> 00:56:18,592
Thank you.

1016
00:56:18,636 --> 00:56:20,464
Um, could I also get
some black coffee,

1017
00:56:20,507 --> 00:56:21,813
if you don't mind.

1018
00:56:21,856 --> 00:56:23,771
Yes sir, yes.

1019
00:56:32,519 --> 00:56:33,999
I think you made
her day.

1020
00:56:34,042 --> 00:56:35,217
No more like
her year.

1021
00:56:36,828 --> 00:56:38,743
I don't think
I've ever made

1022
00:56:38,786 --> 00:56:40,571
that many decisions
about food
in my entire life.

1023
00:56:46,490 --> 00:56:48,796
My mama says you dance
like a chicken.

1024
00:56:51,364 --> 00:56:53,627
But I think
you did real good.

1025
00:56:53,671 --> 00:56:54,019
Thank you.

1026
00:56:59,764 --> 00:57:00,939
Sweet girl...

1027
00:57:03,507 --> 00:57:05,378
Blind as a bat,
but a sweet girl.

1028
00:57:17,085 --> 00:57:18,739
I'll see you fellas
on Friday.

1029
00:57:18,783 --> 00:57:19,523
Alrighty, Wade.

1030
00:57:22,221 --> 00:57:24,441
Got your guitar
with you?Always.

1031
00:57:24,484 --> 00:57:25,790
Good, let's go.

1032
00:57:27,052 --> 00:57:29,837
Where we goin'?

1033
00:57:29,881 --> 00:57:31,273
I need your help
on a little something

1034
00:57:31,317 --> 00:57:32,971
that Shelby cooks up
every Christmas.

1035
00:57:34,973 --> 00:57:36,017
All right.

1036
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:41,327
There is a rumor...

1037
00:57:41,370 --> 00:57:42,371
There is?Mmm-hmm,
mmm-hmm.

1038
00:57:42,415 --> 00:57:43,851
What is it?

1039
00:57:43,895 --> 00:57:45,505
There is a rumor

1040
00:57:45,549 --> 00:57:47,115
that Santa
is on his way here.

1041
00:57:48,334 --> 00:57:50,423
He is?!He is!

1042
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:52,556
Wait, wait,
I think I hear...

1043
00:57:52,599 --> 00:57:53,905
Did you hear that?I do, I heard it too.

1044
00:57:53,948 --> 00:57:55,820
Did you guys hear?

1045
00:57:55,863 --> 00:57:56,821
I think I heard
his reindeer.

1046
00:57:57,865 --> 00:57:59,432
Ho, ho, ho!

1047
00:57:59,867 --> 00:58:00,868
Santa!

1048
00:58:00,912 --> 00:58:02,914
Merry Christmas!

1049
00:58:02,957 --> 00:58:05,394
Ho, ho, ho!

1050
00:58:05,438 --> 00:58:08,528
Santa Claus,
and we got Mrs. Claus.

1051
00:58:08,572 --> 00:58:13,315
Merry Christmas!

1052
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:16,318
Well has everyone been a
good little boy or girl?

1053
00:58:16,362 --> 00:58:17,755
<i> Dashing through the snow

1054
00:58:17,798 --> 00:58:20,235

You know this is one of my

1061
00:58:30,028 --> 00:58:32,247
Yeah?

1062
00:58:32,291 --> 00:58:34,336
Seeing all the smiles
on these kids' faces.

1063
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:36,208
<i> Jingle bells, jingle bells

1064

That.

1067
00:58:41,213 --> 00:58:42,344
That little sparkle
in your eye

1068
00:58:42,388 --> 00:58:44,259
every time you
look at him.

1069
00:58:44,303 --> 00:58:47,524
Same as you
always have.

1070
00:58:47,567 --> 00:58:50,701
Yeah well that spark
burned me once.

1071
00:58:50,744 --> 00:58:51,528
I'm not gonna let it
burn me again.

1072
00:58:56,881 --> 00:58:58,143
Yes ma'am.

1073
00:58:58,186 --> 00:59:00,188
Are you Mason Wyatt?

1074
00:59:00,232 --> 00:59:02,582
I am Mason Wyatt,
yeah.

1075
00:59:02,626 --> 00:59:04,715
Miss Shelby says
you sing really pretty

1076
00:59:04,758 --> 00:59:06,412
but you dance...

1077
00:59:06,455 --> 00:59:08,196
I know she says I dance
like a chicken.

1078
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:10,155
Nope, she says
you dance

1079
00:59:10,198 --> 00:59:11,417
like a one
legged goat.

1080
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:16,814
Yeah well.

1081
00:59:16,857 --> 00:59:20,165
She also says
you're kinda cute.

1082
00:59:20,208 --> 00:59:22,776
Ooooh!

1083
00:59:23,821 --> 00:59:25,387
Really?

1084
00:59:25,431 --> 00:59:27,215
Well I'll tell
you what.

1085
00:59:27,259 --> 00:59:28,390
Can you tell miss Shelby
that the one legged goat

1086
00:59:28,434 --> 00:59:29,304
says thank you.

1087
00:59:29,348 --> 00:59:31,306
Okay, I will.

1088
00:59:31,350 --> 00:59:32,786
Okay.

1089
00:59:32,830 --> 00:59:34,048
You guys wanna sing
some more?

1090
00:59:34,092 --> 00:59:35,528
Yes!Are you ready?

1091
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:37,443
Yes!

1092
00:59:37,486 --> 00:59:38,444
I need you to clap.
Can you clap?

1093
00:59:38,487 --> 00:59:39,488
Here we go.

1094
00:59:41,534 --> 00:59:43,405
<i> Dashing through the snow

1095
00:59:43,449 --> 00:59:45,407
<i> in a one horse open sleigh

1096
00:59:45,451 --> 00:59:47,627
<i> o'er the hills we go

1097
00:59:47,671 --> 00:59:48,715
<i> laughing all the way

1098
00:59:48,759 --> 00:59:50,021
<i> ha ha ha

1099
00:59:50,064 --> 00:59:52,763
<i> bells on Bob-tails ring...

1100
01:00:03,904 --> 01:00:04,905
What?

1101
01:00:06,646 --> 01:00:07,908
Oh no.

1102
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:11,738
Morning.

1103
01:00:13,914 --> 01:00:16,308
Shelby.

1104
01:00:16,351 --> 01:00:19,528
Where- where
is everybody?

1105
01:00:19,572 --> 01:00:22,270
I had to lay 'em
all off 'til spring.

1106
01:00:22,314 --> 01:00:24,185
The bank called
in my line yesterday,

1107
01:00:24,229 --> 01:00:25,752
and it took all
the cash we had

1108
01:00:25,796 --> 01:00:29,538
just to keep this place
from foreclosure.

1109
01:00:29,582 --> 01:00:30,452
I just hope we can
start back up

1110
01:00:30,496 --> 01:00:31,758
when the new season begins.

1111
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:37,242
Listen, I'm sorry.

1112
01:00:37,285 --> 01:00:39,810
We won't be in any position
to expand anytime soon.

1113
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:45,903
I understand.

1114
01:00:59,917 --> 01:01:00,787
Yes sir,
the reports

1115
01:01:00,831 --> 01:01:03,703
are generating now.

1116
01:01:03,747 --> 01:01:05,052
I'll have them to you
by end of business.

1117
01:01:05,096 --> 01:01:06,097
Okay.

1118
01:01:07,533 --> 01:01:09,230
Yes sir, okay.

1119
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,451
Sorry, uh.

1120
01:01:12,494 --> 01:01:13,931
How can I help you,
Shelby?

1121
01:01:13,974 --> 01:01:16,324
I just left
the Miller farm.

1122
01:01:16,368 --> 01:01:17,369
Is it true
that y'all

1123
01:01:17,412 --> 01:01:18,675
called in
their note?

1124
01:01:18,718 --> 01:01:20,677
I'm not at Liberty
to discuss that.

1125
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,200
But we have had
to make

1126
01:01:22,243 --> 01:01:23,418
some tough decisions
this quarter.

1127
01:01:25,116 --> 01:01:26,421
What about us?

1128
01:01:26,465 --> 01:01:28,293
I'm sorry.

1129
01:01:28,336 --> 01:01:30,077
You should be receiving
your letter today.

1130
01:01:30,121 --> 01:01:31,600
What does that mean?

1131
01:01:31,644 --> 01:01:33,124
If you can't bring
your account current,

1132
01:01:33,167 --> 01:01:35,213
we'll have to begin
foreclosure proceedings.

1133
01:01:37,345 --> 01:01:40,609
By when?January 2nd.

1134
01:01:42,742 --> 01:01:43,743
I'm sorry, Shelby.

1135
01:01:47,486 --> 01:01:48,530
I just want to
let you know

1136
01:01:48,574 --> 01:01:49,401
that pine valley
savings and loan

1137
01:01:49,444 --> 01:01:51,055
appreciates
your business.

1138
01:01:51,098 --> 01:01:53,187
Been a pleasure working
with you over the years.

1139
01:01:53,231 --> 01:01:54,580
You know if you're gonna
do business with him,

1140
01:01:54,623 --> 01:01:54,841
you're gonna want to
keep both hands

1141
01:01:54,885 --> 01:01:55,886
on your wallet.

1142
01:01:57,278 --> 01:01:58,627
Ha.
That's nothing.

1143
01:01:58,671 --> 01:01:59,977
Uh, like I said,

1144
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:01,195
we appreciate
your business.

1145
01:02:01,239 --> 01:02:02,066
We'll get that
paperwork out-

1146
01:02:11,075 --> 01:02:13,860
Less than three weeks.

1147
01:02:13,904 --> 01:02:16,428
What are we gonna do?

1148
01:02:16,471 --> 01:02:18,082
You talk to
the grocery woman?

1149
01:02:18,125 --> 01:02:19,344
Mm-hmm.

1150
01:02:21,041 --> 01:02:21,955
She said she can't
do anything

1151
01:02:21,999 --> 01:02:23,174
until after
the holidays.

1152
01:02:23,217 --> 01:02:24,523
Hm.

1153
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,534
I've got an idea.

1154
01:02:35,577 --> 01:02:37,188
What?

1155
01:02:37,231 --> 01:02:38,406
Mason.

1156
01:02:39,843 --> 01:02:42,149
Mason?

1157
01:02:42,193 --> 01:02:43,020
No, he doesn't have
that kind of money.

1158
01:02:43,063 --> 01:02:44,456
And if he did,

1159
01:02:44,499 --> 01:02:45,239
we wouldn't take
it from him.

1160
01:02:45,283 --> 01:02:46,501
No, no, no!

1161
01:02:46,545 --> 01:02:47,764
I'm not talking
about that.

1162
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:50,244
I've got another
idea.

1163
01:02:51,376 --> 01:02:53,857
It'll work Shelby.

1164
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:56,598
Daddy, I can't, no! It's a good idea.

1165
01:02:56,642 --> 01:02:57,948
Absolutely not, no.

1166
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:02,300
No! Ugh.

1167
01:03:09,611 --> 01:03:10,656
Everything okay?

1168
01:03:14,007 --> 01:03:17,576
We got the final notice
on the house.

1169
01:03:17,619 --> 01:03:18,838
We have until
January 2.

1170
01:03:29,022 --> 01:03:30,676
Okay.

1171
01:03:30,719 --> 01:03:33,070
My father has some...

1172
01:03:33,113 --> 01:03:34,375
Hair brained idea.

1173
01:03:37,030 --> 01:03:39,206
All right,
let's hear it.

1174
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:40,120
He thinks that we
should have a concert.

1175
01:03:42,906 --> 01:03:45,604
Benefit concert here
on Christmas Eve.

1176
01:03:45,647 --> 01:03:48,215
And I mean,
I cannot believe

1177
01:03:48,259 --> 01:03:49,042
I'm getting ready
to ask you this.

1178
01:03:53,046 --> 01:03:53,960
Mason...

1179
01:03:59,748 --> 01:04:01,838
Would you play here
on Christmas Eve?

1180
01:04:01,881 --> 01:04:02,795
That's it?

1181
01:04:05,232 --> 01:04:06,538
Please?

1182
01:04:09,933 --> 01:04:12,370
No, I mean is that
all you need?

1183
01:04:12,413 --> 01:04:13,937
Yeah.

1184
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:16,113
Of course.

1185
01:04:16,156 --> 01:04:17,114
Shelby, I'd be
happy to help.

1186
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:21,553
All right.

1187
01:04:21,596 --> 01:04:23,642
So this is
a business deal,

1188
01:04:23,685 --> 01:04:25,600
and we'll split
the proceeds.

1189
01:04:25,644 --> 01:04:27,124
Okay, what about
merchandise?

1190
01:04:27,167 --> 01:04:29,082
I don't know,
what about it?

1191
01:04:29,126 --> 01:04:30,518
How do we
split that?

1192
01:04:30,562 --> 01:04:32,216
Whatever's
standard.

1193
01:04:32,259 --> 01:04:33,782
Okay, standardly

1194
01:04:33,826 --> 01:04:34,609
I get to
keep it all.

1195
01:04:36,350 --> 01:04:39,440
Oh, well okay.

1196
01:04:41,790 --> 01:04:43,618
I'm just messing
with you.

1197
01:04:43,662 --> 01:04:44,315
Whatever you want,
Shelby.

1198
01:04:44,358 --> 01:04:45,794
Honestly, I’m-

1199
01:04:45,838 --> 01:04:46,970
I really am
happy to help.

1200
01:04:49,450 --> 01:04:51,235
Great.

1201
01:04:51,278 --> 01:04:52,236
So we got a deal?

1202
01:04:56,196 --> 01:04:57,632
You bet.

1203
01:05:05,989 --> 01:05:06,946
Pleasure doing
business with you.

1204
01:05:21,830 --> 01:05:22,788
This place hasn't
changed much.

1205
01:05:22,831 --> 01:05:24,746
No.

1206
01:05:24,790 --> 01:05:26,270
How old were you

1207
01:05:26,313 --> 01:05:28,489
when you first
came through here?

1208
01:05:28,533 --> 01:05:29,490
16.

1209
01:05:29,534 --> 01:05:31,492
No.yeah,

1210
01:05:31,536 --> 01:05:32,667
I had just played my
first show at Harper's.

1211
01:05:34,191 --> 01:05:37,455
July 4th.

1212
01:05:37,498 --> 01:05:42,199
Okay guys,
here we go in 3, 2...

1213
01:05:42,242 --> 01:05:44,679
Okay, that was David bowie
and bing Crosby

1214
01:05:44,723 --> 01:05:46,943
with "little drummer boy,"
one of my favorites.

1215
01:05:46,986 --> 01:05:49,162
Mine too.Really?

1216
01:05:49,206 --> 01:05:50,337
Yeah, I love the mix
of the old and the new

1217
01:05:50,381 --> 01:05:51,643
with David bowie
and bing Crosby.

1218
01:05:51,686 --> 01:05:53,384
Yeah, good, good.

1219
01:05:53,427 --> 01:05:55,125
Hey, if some of you
listeners out there

1220
01:05:55,168 --> 01:05:56,996
think you might
recognize that voice

1221
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:59,477
then you are
probably correct.

1222
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:01,783
Joining us today in studio
is our special guest...

1223
01:06:01,827 --> 01:06:03,481
Mr. Mason Wyatt.

1224
01:06:03,524 --> 01:06:04,961
Welcome.good to be here.

1225
01:06:05,004 --> 01:06:05,483
Oh, it's good
to have you.

1226
01:06:05,526 --> 01:06:07,441
Good to have you.

1227
01:06:07,485 --> 01:06:09,008
And joining him as well,
is miss Shelby Haygood,

1228
01:06:09,052 --> 01:06:11,532
a local business owner.

1229
01:06:11,576 --> 01:06:14,927
Good to have you.

1230
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:17,277
Oh, uh hey-
hey y'all.

1231
01:06:19,149 --> 01:06:21,542
I know you all have
come up today

1232
01:06:21,586 --> 01:06:23,022
to talk about
an exciting event

1233
01:06:23,066 --> 01:06:24,371
that's about
to take place.

1234
01:06:24,415 --> 01:06:26,721
But I can't resist

1235
01:06:26,765 --> 01:06:27,592
talking a little
music first,

1236
01:06:27,635 --> 01:06:28,549
if that's okay.

1237
01:06:28,593 --> 01:06:30,247
That sounds good.

1238
01:06:30,290 --> 01:06:31,813
We just found out,
of course,

1239
01:06:31,857 --> 01:06:32,901
that you're a
bing Crosby fan.

1240
01:06:32,945 --> 01:06:35,034
What about some
of your other

1241
01:06:35,078 --> 01:06:36,296
Christmas songs
you like?

1242
01:06:36,340 --> 01:06:37,167
I love all
Christmas music

1243
01:06:37,210 --> 01:06:38,037
to be honest
with you.

1244
01:06:38,081 --> 01:06:38,733
I'm a big fan
in general.

1245
01:06:38,777 --> 01:06:40,648
But Johnny Mathis.

1246
01:06:40,692 --> 01:06:41,998
Yeah.

1247
01:06:42,041 --> 01:06:44,435
Perry Como,
Andy Williams.

1248
01:06:44,478 --> 01:06:46,132
Uh, Dolly Parton.

1249
01:06:46,176 --> 01:06:48,178
Amen.

1250
01:06:48,221 --> 01:06:49,353
Darlene love, "please come
home for Christmas."

1251
01:06:49,396 --> 01:06:51,746
There you go.

1252
01:06:51,790 --> 01:06:54,314
John Lennon,
"happy Christmas."

1253
01:06:54,358 --> 01:06:55,924
Uh, John Mellencamp,
"I saw mama kissing
Santa Claus."

1254
01:06:55,968 --> 01:06:57,143
Yeah.

1255
01:06:57,187 --> 01:06:58,840
John Denver
and the muppets.

1256
01:06:58,884 --> 01:07:00,886
Oh, man yeah.That's the best.

1257
01:07:00,929 --> 01:07:03,889
Uh yeah, the boss
of course,

1258
01:07:03,932 --> 01:07:04,846
"Santa Claus is
coming to town."

1259
01:07:04,890 --> 01:07:06,848
Oh, preach it
brother, yeah.

1260
01:07:06,892 --> 01:07:09,373
But still my favorite
to this day

1261
01:07:09,416 --> 01:07:12,028
is Nat King Cole singing,
"o holy night."

1262
01:07:12,071 --> 01:07:12,593
Really?

1263
01:07:12,637 --> 01:07:14,639
Yeah, yeah.

1264
01:07:14,682 --> 01:07:16,336
My mom used to put that
on every Christmas Eve.

1265
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:17,990
She would break out the vinyl
and put that record on.

1266
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:21,211
And I still...

1267
01:07:21,254 --> 01:07:22,038
Can't listen to that song
without breaking down,

1268
01:07:22,081 --> 01:07:24,083
to be honest.

1269
01:07:24,127 --> 01:07:26,346
Which is why I’m
so excited that

1270
01:07:26,390 --> 01:07:28,348
we're doing this concert,
to honor Christmas,

1271
01:07:28,392 --> 01:07:30,089
which my mom loved
so much.

1272
01:07:30,133 --> 01:07:33,223
Well I'm glad you
brought that up, Mason.

1273
01:07:33,266 --> 01:07:34,789
Why don't we let
our listeners in

1274
01:07:34,833 --> 01:07:35,747
on what's going on
with you guys?

1275
01:07:35,790 --> 01:07:37,531
So what's cooking?

1276
01:07:37,575 --> 01:07:39,272
Shelby,
what's cooking?

1277
01:07:41,405 --> 01:07:43,798
Uh, well uh, um...

1278
01:07:43,842 --> 01:07:45,931
On December 24th
we're having

1279
01:07:45,974 --> 01:07:51,197
a concert
at the farm.

1280
01:07:51,241 --> 01:07:52,633
You remember when we
used to do those downtown,

1281
01:07:52,677 --> 01:07:53,504
we would put on those
Christmas concerts

1282
01:07:53,547 --> 01:07:54,374
and those cantatas?

1283
01:07:54,418 --> 01:07:56,072
Yeah, yeah...

1284
01:07:56,115 --> 01:07:57,725
Chet Adkins came
to one of those.

1285
01:07:57,769 --> 01:07:59,118
Doc Watson as well.

1286
01:07:59,162 --> 01:08:01,381
Exactly, right.

1287
01:08:01,425 --> 01:08:03,209
Well I love those,
I miss those.

1288
01:08:03,253 --> 01:08:04,471
I think a lot of you
guys do too,

1289
01:08:04,515 --> 01:08:06,691
and so I wanted to do
'em again.

1290
01:08:06,734 --> 01:08:08,258
And just kind of wanted
to bring things back

1291
01:08:08,301 --> 01:08:09,824
to the way they used
to be.

1292
01:08:09,868 --> 01:08:11,391
With that in mind,
I thought

1293
01:08:11,435 --> 01:08:12,349
one of the best things
we could do

1294
01:08:12,392 --> 01:08:14,090
is to help out
one of our own

1295
01:08:14,133 --> 01:08:15,569
who's in need
this Christmas.

1296
01:08:15,613 --> 01:08:16,831
And so, we're putting
on a benefit concert

1297
01:08:16,875 --> 01:08:19,921
for the classic
Haygood farm,

1298
01:08:19,965 --> 01:08:21,575
where things have
stayed simple.

1299
01:08:21,619 --> 01:08:23,011
And we want to keep
it that way.

1300
01:08:23,055 --> 01:08:24,535
So the event
starts early.

1301
01:08:24,578 --> 01:08:26,276
You guys will still be
able to go to church

1302
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:27,842
later on that
night.

1303
01:08:27,886 --> 01:08:29,801
And hang the stocking
the way

1304
01:08:29,844 --> 01:08:31,019
it's supposed
to be hung.

1305
01:08:31,063 --> 01:08:32,717
I think we open
the doors at 10 am,

1306
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:34,197
and you've got all kinds
of craziness planned.

1307
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:35,502
Why don't you tell
them about that?

1308
01:08:35,546 --> 01:08:36,503
Uh, yeah,
we've got hayrides,

1309
01:08:36,547 --> 01:08:37,635
a petting zoo.

1310
01:08:37,678 --> 01:08:40,116
Uh...
Food for everyone.

1311
01:08:40,159 --> 01:08:42,292
Santa's gonna be
there.

1312
01:08:42,335 --> 01:08:44,642
And Mason's going on
in the afternoon.

1313
01:08:44,685 --> 01:08:46,687
And it's a very fair
price too, I may say.

1314
01:08:46,731 --> 01:08:47,427
Am I right?

1315
01:08:47,471 --> 01:08:48,254
Oh, we think so.

1316
01:08:48,298 --> 01:08:49,864
It's $15 a person,

1317
01:08:49,908 --> 01:08:52,258
and kids under five
are free.

1318
01:08:52,302 --> 01:08:53,172
We think it's
a great way

1319
01:08:53,216 --> 01:08:55,043
to spend a very
important day

1320
01:08:55,087 --> 01:08:57,394
with the people
that you care about.

1321
01:08:57,437 --> 01:08:58,656
I agree,
I agree.

1322
01:08:58,699 --> 01:09:00,353
Let's give our
listeners a chance

1323
01:09:00,397 --> 01:09:01,615
to win some
tickets now,

1324
01:09:01,659 --> 01:09:03,269
if you'll be our
ninth caller

1325
01:09:03,313 --> 01:09:04,227
and can tell us
one of your

1326
01:09:04,270 --> 01:09:05,619
favorite
Christmas songs,

1327
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:07,317
then we will get you
some tickets.

1328
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:09,101
And we're gonna
talk Mason

1329
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:10,146
into doing a live number
for us now,

1330
01:09:10,189 --> 01:09:11,408
if you don't mind.

1331
01:09:11,451 --> 01:09:12,974
What are you gonna
do for us?

1332
01:09:13,018 --> 01:09:13,888
I'm gonna do "o come all
ye faithful".

1333
01:09:13,932 --> 01:09:14,628
Good.

1334
01:09:23,333 --> 01:09:28,207
<i> O come all ye faithful

1335
01:09:28,251 --> 01:09:32,429
<i> joyful and triumphant

1336
01:09:32,472 --> 01:09:39,262
<i> o come ye, o come ye
to Bethlehem

1337
01:09:41,481 --> 01:09:46,007
<i> come and behold him

1338
01:09:46,051 --> 01:09:50,316
<i> born the king of angels

1339
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:54,451
<i> o come let us adore him

1340
01:09:54,494 --> 01:09:58,846
<i> o come, let us adore him

1341
01:09:58,890 --> 01:10:03,460
<i> o come, let us adore him

1342
01:10:03,503 --> 01:10:07,028
<i> Christ the lord

1343
01:10:46,807 --> 01:10:49,027
You positive?

1344
01:10:49,070 --> 01:10:51,290
You can get those flights?

1345
01:10:51,334 --> 01:10:52,422
So it's official?

1346
01:10:55,207 --> 01:10:55,860
All right, give me
10 minutes,

1347
01:10:55,903 --> 01:10:57,340
I'll call you back.

1348
01:11:03,955 --> 01:11:05,435
Good morning, son.

1349
01:11:05,478 --> 01:11:06,305
Morning
everybody.

1350
01:11:06,349 --> 01:11:08,699
Good morning.

1351
01:11:08,742 --> 01:11:11,484
We were just recounting
that church picnic

1352
01:11:11,528 --> 01:11:13,181
we took down by
Robert's creek.

1353
01:11:13,225 --> 01:11:14,052
Do you remember that?

1354
01:11:14,095 --> 01:11:16,141
Oh I remember.

1355
01:11:16,184 --> 01:11:17,795
Oh, you know,

1356
01:11:17,838 --> 01:11:19,405
please tell me
you are not going around

1357
01:11:19,449 --> 01:11:20,624
still telling that lie.

1358
01:11:20,667 --> 01:11:22,060
No, it's the truth,

1359
01:11:22,103 --> 01:11:23,322
but I do
tell the story

1360
01:11:23,366 --> 01:11:25,106
every time I get
a chance, yeah.

1361
01:11:25,150 --> 01:11:26,456
Okay, maybe it
wasn't a lie,

1362
01:11:26,499 --> 01:11:28,022
but it's a drastic
exaggeration.

1363
01:11:28,066 --> 01:11:29,546
My favorite kind.

1364
01:11:29,589 --> 01:11:31,287
I tell it like
I saw it.

1365
01:11:31,330 --> 01:11:32,288
Well you need to get
your eyes checked then.

1366
01:11:32,331 --> 01:11:33,114
Oh yeah, I didn't
see you

1367
01:11:33,158 --> 01:11:34,420
running out
of the forest

1368
01:11:34,464 --> 01:11:36,379
like some bear
was chasing you.

1369
01:11:36,422 --> 01:11:40,339
It was a brisk walk,
I will give you that.

1370
01:11:40,383 --> 01:11:43,124
Oh you come bustin'
outta there full throttle.

1371
01:11:43,168 --> 01:11:45,083
Run over that
blanket that's

1372
01:11:45,126 --> 01:11:46,911
loaded down
with tater salad.

1373
01:11:46,954 --> 01:11:48,869
Daddy!

1374
01:11:48,913 --> 01:11:50,697
And I forget um,
Shelby,

1375
01:11:50,741 --> 01:11:53,134
was that a bear?

1376
01:11:53,178 --> 01:11:54,484
Stop, now you know
it wasn't.

1377
01:11:54,527 --> 01:11:56,007
So stop.

1378
01:11:56,050 --> 01:11:57,965
What was it now,
can you help me?

1379
01:11:58,009 --> 01:11:58,836
It was the biggest bunny
rabbit I've ever seen.

1380
01:12:00,272 --> 01:12:00,707
You were runnin'
for your life

1381
01:12:00,751 --> 01:12:02,274
from a bunny, Shelby.

1382
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:03,057
Well listen,
I saw eyes and ears

1383
01:12:03,101 --> 01:12:04,537
and it was
coming at me

1384
01:12:04,581 --> 01:12:05,582
and if I had to do it
again I would.

1385
01:12:05,625 --> 01:12:07,888
It was a very
big bunny,

1386
01:12:07,932 --> 01:12:09,325
I will give you that.

1387
01:12:09,368 --> 01:12:10,978
All right, y'all need
to stop okay?

1388
01:12:11,022 --> 01:12:11,892
Just stop.

1389
01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:16,984
Hey can I talk to you out
front for a second?

1390
01:12:17,028 --> 01:12:18,856
Yes please, gladly.

1391
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:23,730
They look cute together,
don't they?

1392
01:12:27,952 --> 01:12:29,954
You all right?Yeah.

1393
01:12:29,997 --> 01:12:31,259
What's up?

1394
01:12:31,303 --> 01:12:33,784
Uh...

1395
01:12:33,827 --> 01:12:35,046
I have an offer.

1396
01:12:35,089 --> 01:12:37,744
You have an offer.

1397
01:12:37,788 --> 01:12:39,050
Yeah, I have an offer
to play in Seattle
tomorrow night.

1398
01:12:39,093 --> 01:12:41,269
It's a big deal.

1399
01:12:41,313 --> 01:12:43,837
Uh, so you're
leaving?

1400
01:12:43,881 --> 01:12:44,708
You're not gonna
be here?

1401
01:12:44,751 --> 01:12:46,536
I'll be here, it's...

1402
01:12:46,579 --> 01:12:47,711
One of the headliners

1403
01:12:47,754 --> 01:12:49,234
broke his leg skiing
or something

1404
01:12:49,277 --> 01:12:49,974
and the promoters
want me to come out

1405
01:12:50,017 --> 01:12:51,236
and play tomorrow night

1406
01:12:51,279 --> 01:12:52,150
and then pick it back up
on the 27th.

1407
01:12:52,193 --> 01:12:54,326
So, I'd fly out
a few hours,

1408
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:55,414
play the show

1409
01:12:55,458 --> 01:12:57,242
and then come back

1410
01:12:57,285 --> 01:12:59,679
first thing the morning
of the 24th.

1411
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:20,613
At the latest.At the latest,
yeah.

1412
01:13:20,657 --> 01:13:21,571
I do this all
the time,

1413
01:13:21,614 --> 01:13:23,834
all right?

1414
01:13:23,877 --> 01:13:25,444
This is a good offer,Shelby.

1415
01:13:25,488 --> 01:13:27,838
The one I've been
waiting for.

1416
01:13:27,881 --> 01:13:28,969
You know I need
the money

1417
01:13:29,013 --> 01:13:31,189
and I need
the fresh start.

1418
01:13:31,232 --> 01:13:34,714
Mason, just stop.

1419
01:13:34,758 --> 01:13:38,283
You know, we've been
here before.

1420
01:13:38,326 --> 01:13:39,850
You leaving, promising
to come back.

1421
01:13:39,893 --> 01:13:40,590
This is different.

1422
01:13:40,633 --> 01:13:43,723
How's it different?

1423
01:13:43,767 --> 01:13:44,811
This place means
everything to me

1424
01:13:44,855 --> 01:13:46,334
and you know that

1425
01:13:46,378 --> 01:13:48,815
and you're still choosing
to leave.

1426
01:13:48,859 --> 01:13:49,903
I mean this is it,

1427
01:13:49,947 --> 01:13:51,862
this was our
last hope.

1428
01:13:51,905 --> 01:13:53,124
I'll be back.

1429
01:13:56,910 --> 01:13:58,825
You have said that
to me before.

1430
01:14:02,350 --> 01:14:05,223
I promise,
I'll be here.

1431
01:14:06,659 --> 01:14:09,053
So stupid.

1432
01:14:09,096 --> 01:14:10,663
I'm stupid,
you know.

1433
01:14:10,707 --> 01:14:12,012
Stupid for believing
in you,

1434
01:14:12,056 --> 01:14:13,187
stupid for thinking
that you've changed.

1435
01:14:13,231 --> 01:14:15,102
You know what, Mason?

1436
01:14:15,146 --> 01:14:16,800
You do what you always do,

1437
01:14:16,843 --> 01:14:18,454
which is whatever is best
for Mason Wyatt

1438
01:14:18,497 --> 01:14:21,587
and I'll do what I do.

1439
01:14:21,631 --> 01:14:23,546
Which is expect nothing
from you.

1440
01:15:52,809 --> 01:15:53,940
Imagining that's my head?

1441
01:16:09,042 --> 01:16:12,002
I turned them down.

1442
01:16:12,045 --> 01:16:15,309
Shelby I...

1443
01:16:15,353 --> 01:16:15,962
Never should've
left you

1444
01:16:16,006 --> 01:16:19,923
in the first
place.

1445
01:16:19,966 --> 01:16:22,403
I don't know why
I didn't come back.

1446
01:16:22,447 --> 01:16:23,274
Why I waited so long
to write.

1447
01:16:23,317 --> 01:16:26,407
Call.

1448
01:16:26,451 --> 01:16:27,844
So many decisions
that I've made,

1449
01:16:27,887 --> 01:16:28,627
things that I've
done...

1450
01:16:32,109 --> 01:16:34,633
Honestly I don't know
why I've done them.

1451
01:16:34,677 --> 01:16:37,027
I wish to god I could
take them back.

1452
01:16:37,070 --> 01:16:38,332
But I can't.

1453
01:16:43,381 --> 01:16:46,558
I'm here to stay.

1454
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:48,038
I can do this
on my own, Mason.

1455
01:16:51,084 --> 01:16:52,999
I don't need you.

1456
01:16:53,043 --> 01:16:53,870
Yeah, I know.

1457
01:16:57,221 --> 01:16:58,135
I need you.

1458
01:17:01,225 --> 01:17:03,357
Always have.

1459
01:17:03,401 --> 01:17:04,141
Always will.

1460
01:17:10,974 --> 01:17:12,236
Uh, so...

1461
01:17:15,979 --> 01:17:19,330
Now I'm gonna go slink
back to my room...

1462
01:17:19,373 --> 01:17:20,200
'Cause I have a concert
to get ready for.

1463
01:17:40,699 --> 01:17:42,179
Good morning
smoky mountains

1464
01:17:42,222 --> 01:17:44,398
and merry Christmas Eve.

1465
01:17:44,442 --> 01:17:46,052
It's a beautiful day
in these mountains

1466
01:17:46,096 --> 01:17:48,707
and it's a beautiful day
to be alive folks.

1467
01:17:48,751 --> 01:17:50,840
Only one more day until
Christmas morning

1468
01:17:50,883 --> 01:17:54,800
and the big guy
hops down the chimney.

1469
01:17:54,844 --> 01:17:56,759
We are live here today
at the Haygood farm

1470
01:17:56,802 --> 01:17:58,761
for a Christmas Eve
to remember.

1471
01:17:58,804 --> 01:18:00,501
We have quite
the turn out today,

1472
01:18:00,545 --> 01:18:03,287
people have come from...

1473
01:18:03,330 --> 01:18:04,680
Well all up and down
these smoky mountains

1474
01:18:04,723 --> 01:18:06,464
to help one of their own.

1475
01:18:06,507 --> 01:18:08,684
Today is truly a miracle

1476
01:18:08,727 --> 01:18:10,990
that can only happen
on Christmas Eve.

1477
01:18:11,034 --> 01:18:13,558
You can truly feel
the spirit of Christmas

1478
01:18:13,601 --> 01:18:16,692
out here folks and we've even
got a Christmas raffle

1479
01:18:16,735 --> 01:18:19,564
with a prize you don't
want to miss.

1480
01:18:19,607 --> 01:18:21,914
Now if you aren't here then uh
you're really missing out

1481
01:18:21,958 --> 01:18:24,525
so come on over
and give us a visit.

1482
01:18:24,569 --> 01:18:27,441
All the proceeds will go to
saving the Haygood farm

1483
01:18:27,485 --> 01:18:31,445
and all those wonderful pies
that you all love so much.

1484
01:18:31,489 --> 01:18:33,143
So, what do you think about
all this miss Shelby?

1485
01:18:33,186 --> 01:18:35,841
Uh... it's amazing.

1486
01:18:35,885 --> 01:18:37,277
It is amazing,
isn't it?

1487
01:18:37,321 --> 01:18:39,889
It is, I mean
I just...

1488
01:18:39,932 --> 01:18:41,281
It means
so much to me

1489
01:18:41,325 --> 01:18:44,241
and to my family.

1490
01:18:44,284 --> 01:18:45,546
I love this town.

1491
01:18:45,590 --> 01:18:46,722
And I love
these people.

1492
01:18:46,765 --> 01:18:48,854
Yeah.

1493
01:18:48,898 --> 01:18:50,073
And we love Christmas.We do love Christmas.

1494
01:18:50,116 --> 01:18:52,640
We do.

1495
01:18:52,684 --> 01:18:54,947
So no matter what happens
here today,

1496
01:18:54,991 --> 01:18:56,557
you know this is going
to be a day

1497
01:18:56,601 --> 01:18:58,124
that we won't
ever forget.

1498
01:18:58,168 --> 01:18:59,343
So thank you.

1499
01:18:59,386 --> 01:19:00,561
Oh you're welcome honey,

1500
01:19:00,605 --> 01:19:02,259
you're very welcome,
no problem.

1501
01:19:02,302 --> 01:19:02,781
Thank all of you.

1502
01:19:05,610 --> 01:19:06,306
And now ladies and
gentlemen,

1503
01:19:06,350 --> 01:19:08,787
Mr. Mason Wyatt!

1504
01:19:25,064 --> 01:19:26,805
Thank you guys so much.

1505
01:19:26,849 --> 01:19:29,112
It's good to be back
where it all began.

1506
01:19:29,155 --> 01:19:29,852
I want you guys
to remember something.

1507
01:19:31,201 --> 01:19:33,333
There's always hope.

1508
01:19:33,377 --> 01:19:35,379
You can always come home.

1509
01:19:35,422 --> 01:19:38,121
So with that in mind,

1510
01:19:38,164 --> 01:19:38,991
I thought we'd start off
with a little seasonal music,

1511
01:19:39,035 --> 01:19:39,731
is that all right?

1512
01:19:47,870 --> 01:19:49,959

1526
01:21:01,900 --> 01:21:03,554
It's the Harrison woman!

1527
01:21:03,597 --> 01:21:05,643
What?the grocery lady.

1528
01:21:05,686 --> 01:21:08,559
She's right here.

1529
01:21:08,602 --> 01:21:09,647
Hello?

1530
01:21:11,692 --> 01:21:12,780

01:21:13,999 --> 01:21:16,872
Yes ma'am.

1532
01:21:16,915 --> 01:21:19,570
Yes, we can do that.

1533
01:21:19,613 --> 01:21:22,181
Yeah we could do that.

1534
01:21:22,225 --> 01:21:24,227

01:21:34,802 --> 01:21:35,891
Yes, merry Christmas
to you, too.

1540
01:21:38,197 --> 01:21:39,895
What, what?

1541
01:21:39,938 --> 01:21:42,114
She... she saw one
of our flyers

1542
01:21:42,158 --> 01:21:43,507
and then heard the concert
on the radio.

1543
01:21:43,550 --> 01:21:45,074
And, and?

1544
01:21:45,117 --> 01:21:47,293
And she loves our story,

1545
01:21:47,337 --> 01:21:48,425
and Harrison's loves
our story!

1546
01:21:48,468 --> 01:21:49,948
She wants to help,

1547
01:21:49,992 --> 01:21:51,036
she's gonna put us
in all her stores,

1548
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:52,995
she's gonna turn
in a v.O.,

1549
01:21:53,038 --> 01:21:55,562
we're gonna get the money
the day after tomorrow.

1550
01:21:55,606 --> 01:21:56,520
That's wonderful.

1551
01:21:56,563 --> 01:21:59,697
Oh thank you lord.

1552
01:21:59,740 --> 01:22:00,741
Let's go celebrate inside,

1553
01:22:00,785 --> 01:22:02,308
it's cold out here!

1554
01:22:02,352 --> 01:22:04,354
I wanna change
my Facebook status.

1555
01:22:04,397 --> 01:22:05,964
Amen to that.

1556
01:22:06,008 --> 01:22:07,270
Tag that banker
fella in it.

1557
01:22:07,313 --> 01:22:10,447
Shelby, um, I was
wonderin'.

1558
01:22:10,490 --> 01:22:12,884
Uh oh.

1559
01:22:12,928 --> 01:22:14,059
No, I was wonderin'

1560
01:22:14,103 --> 01:22:16,801
if you would dance
with me.

1561
01:22:16,844 --> 01:22:18,281
I think dancin' with you

1562
01:22:18,324 --> 01:22:19,760
would be hazardous
to my health.

1563
01:22:22,154 --> 01:22:23,155
Fair enough,
I just...

1564
01:22:23,199 --> 01:22:24,200
Mason.

1565
01:22:24,243 --> 01:22:26,332
I'm kidding.

1566
01:22:26,376 --> 01:22:27,507
I'd love to.

1567
01:22:30,554 --> 01:22:31,555
Ready?

1568
01:22:36,299 --> 01:22:37,387
Always.

1569
01:22:39,780 --> 01:22:43,045
No matter how hard life is,

1570
01:22:43,088 --> 01:22:46,178
no matter how much
we've messed up...

1571
01:22:46,222 --> 01:22:47,136
Or how broken our lives
have become...

1572
01:22:48,876 --> 01:22:50,791
At Christmas...

1573
01:22:50,835 --> 01:22:52,010
Good things can happen.

1574
01:22:53,838 --> 01:22:56,623
So when it comes to it...

1575
01:22:56,667 --> 01:22:58,974
I believe a baby was born
in that manger.

1576
01:22:59,017 --> 01:23:01,933
Merry Christmas
Shelby belle.

1577
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:02,629
Merry Christmas.

1578
01:23:05,981 --> 01:23:07,721
I believe in Christmas.

1579
01:23:09,114 --> 01:23:11,508
