11
00:01:46,187 --> 00:01:47,276
Hi!

12
00:01:48,227 --> 00:01:49,139
Hello!

13
00:02:09,665 --> 00:02:13,129
I don't really wanna go if we won't
be back in time for the Obon Festival...

14
00:02:13,499 --> 00:02:16,228
Even if we take it real easy, it won't
take more than a couple of days.

15
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,083
We'll be back tomorrow night.

16
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,227
And we'll have money
to enjoy the festivities!

17
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:27,127
Captain Kamegorou,
can you give me a ride?

18
00:02:27,172 --> 00:02:28,846
What are you gonna
do on the island?

19
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,206
I've picked some abalone
and want to sell them there.

20
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,661
Gorosuke, trying to make
some money for the Obon, hey?

21
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:38,083
There's too little to make a real profit...

22
00:02:38,505 --> 00:02:41,429
But you ladies just dive and bring
money up from the bottom of the ocean!

23
00:02:41,777 --> 00:02:43,328
You complain too much.

24
00:02:44,838 --> 00:02:46,169
Sankichi's  coming, too?

25
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:49,905
Didn't have much choice...
He pulled me into this.

26
00:02:53,888 --> 00:02:55,622
What are you carrying?

27
00:02:55,729 --> 00:02:57,505
We'll pick up some stones.

28
00:02:57,589 --> 00:02:59,065
You're not taking anything
on your way there?

29
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:00,657
A shame! We'll only
be paid for the trip back!

30
00:03:00,723 --> 00:03:02,670
Hey, Hachi! We're leaving!
Get the anchor!

31
00:03:03,215 --> 00:03:04,114
Gorosuke!

32
00:03:04,356 --> 00:03:05,522
Comin'!

33
00:04:26,711 --> 00:04:30,461
<i>Sea God

34
00:04:38,505 --> 00:04:41,965
Sankichi, I'll do the cooking.
You just watch.

35
00:04:42,153 --> 00:04:44,292
Good thing for me you're on board!

36
00:04:47,171 --> 00:04:49,841
Hey, Sea God!
Where are you heading?

37
00:04:50,147 --> 00:04:52,434
Going to pick up some stones!

38
00:04:52,687 --> 00:04:54,858
Working during Obon?

39
00:04:55,026 --> 00:04:57,631
Gotta make some money
to spend in the Festival!

40
00:05:04,584 --> 00:05:06,709
Hey!
Is the food ready yet?

41
00:05:07,054 --> 00:05:10,034
You sound like you're
starving, you crybaby!

42
00:05:10,116 --> 00:05:12,580
Sankichi, bring out
the miso soup!

43
00:05:12,739 --> 00:05:13,805
Got it!

44
00:05:29,393 --> 00:05:32,441
Love the way food tastes
when cooked this way!

45
00:05:33,172 --> 00:05:35,635
Captain Kamegorou! Food's ready!

46
00:05:35,885 --> 00:05:37,434
You go ahead.

47
00:05:37,558 --> 00:05:39,693
The captain's always the captain!

48
00:05:39,726 --> 00:05:42,987
You eat first.
I'll steer for ya'.

49
00:06:14,846 --> 00:06:17,620
Hey! Sea God!

50
00:06:20,149 --> 00:06:22,173
How was the fishing today?

51
00:06:22,337 --> 00:06:24,516
Very good indeed!

52
00:06:25,062 --> 00:06:27,752
Think we could have one?

53
00:06:27,926 --> 00:06:29,412
Sure!

54
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,461
Thanks a bunch!

55
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:40,416
That's a beautiful skipjack!

56
00:06:40,637 --> 00:06:44,012
Sankichi, you should slice
some sashimi from it for lunch!

57
00:06:44,192 --> 00:06:46,977
The rest we should cook
with some ginger. It's delicious!

58
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,427
Hachi, you're turn here!

59
00:06:49,521 --> 00:06:51,761
Or are you gonna eat
all 5 kilos of rice?

60
00:06:51,842 --> 00:06:54,724
Gorosuke, I'm afraid
there's nothing left.

61
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,861
No way!
You bottomless pig!

62
00:06:58,172 --> 00:07:02,733
Gorosuke, never mind him. Not
even Hachi could eat that much.

63
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,785
He doesn't stop eating!

64
00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:10,679
Now I feel like a human being!

65
00:07:17,752 --> 00:07:19,937
Don't throw up!
That'd be a waste!

66
00:07:23,012 --> 00:07:25,592
There's a storm coming!

67
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,552
The western wind is blowing too strong.
Our "guest" should pay us a visit soon.

68
00:09:24,044 --> 00:09:26,281
What a day for us to meet on!

69
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:31,506
By now we should be on the island,
and I should be embracing my girl.

70
00:09:32,052 --> 00:09:35,906
We're drifting towards east.
What will we do?

71
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:40,356
There's nothing we can do.
Not in a situation like this.

72
00:09:42,026 --> 00:09:46,677
So we won't be back home tomorrow?
Damn ship I got myself in!

73
00:09:49,993 --> 00:09:52,703
Blow as much as you want!

74
00:10:04,641 --> 00:10:10,048
-Sankichi! You should eat something!
-Do you think we'll be ok?

75
00:10:10,337 --> 00:10:14,503
Don't worry. It will be over by morning.

76
00:10:26,774 --> 00:10:29,286
Sankichi! Eat something!

77
00:10:31,318 --> 00:10:33,668
Hold on tight!

78
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:37,724
Don't you go dying
before marrying some girl!

79
00:10:37,856 --> 00:10:41,037
<i>I have the sea in front of me

80
00:10:41,251 --> 00:10:49,746
<i>The mountains behind me

81
00:10:50,175 --> 00:10:55,794
<i>Omatsubara...!

82
00:11:05,196 --> 00:11:08,276
Gorosuke! The barrel!
Hachi! Get over here!

83
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:03,956
There's something wrong with
the rudder! Hachi, take a look at it!

84
00:13:04,193 --> 00:13:05,929
Gorosuke! Hachi!

85
00:13:20,962 --> 00:13:23,808
We've lost the rudder!

86
00:13:48,821 --> 00:13:51,118
Captain! Uncle!

87
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,607
The engine stopped!

88
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,396
What are all of you doing?
You don't want to live?

89
00:14:11,593 --> 00:14:14,881
Don't wanna be saved?
And you call yourselves 'seamen'?

90
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:18,461
We have no rudder…

91
00:14:19,218 --> 00:14:20,649
No fuel…

92
00:14:20,882 --> 00:14:22,354
There's nothing we can do…

93
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:25,361
Fool! You think this is
enough to bring me down?

94
00:14:25,538 --> 00:14:27,677
Let's get the water out!
I'm not gonna die!

95
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:31,101
Gorosuke! Sankichi!
Come with me!

96
00:14:32,969 --> 00:14:33,905
Come!

97
00:16:19,306 --> 00:16:23,382
Captain Kamegorou,
how far have we drifted?

98
00:16:25,925 --> 00:16:29,739
Well...we've been drifting
eastward for 5 days now...

99
00:16:29,901 --> 00:16:31,998
That's quite a stretch...

100
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:41,130
There goes the Obon Festival...

101
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,528
That will do. Let's work
on the rudder, now. Come up!

102
00:16:58,084 --> 00:17:00,082
-So?
-It's fixed!

103
00:17:00,169 --> 00:17:02,697
What's the use?
There's no fuel!

104
00:17:02,757 --> 00:17:05,593
Stupid! Without a rudder,
the ship could be overturned!

105
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:10,842
Uncle?

106
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:15,066
How far do you
think we'll drift?

107
00:18:18,483 --> 00:18:20,287
Will we survive?

108
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,912
Fool!
Have no fear!

109
00:18:33,496 --> 00:18:36,071
Sankichi, how much
rice have we got left?

110
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:40,570
About 15 kilos, I'd say.

111
00:18:41,126 --> 00:18:44,119
Then we're gonna have
porridge, starting tomorrow.

112
00:18:45,578 --> 00:18:47,606
And how are we
gonna live on that?

113
00:18:48,518 --> 00:18:49,883
What did you say?

114
00:18:50,413 --> 00:18:53,491
Will the porridge make the
rice last that much longer?

115
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:57,070
If we're going to starve, I
don't want to do it eating porridge.

116
00:18:57,926 --> 00:19:01,269
Gorosuke, ain't I right?
Don't you agree?

117
00:19:01,813 --> 00:19:03,826
I don't want no porridge!

118
00:19:03,941 --> 00:19:06,770
Me neither!
I won't eat porridge!

119
00:19:06,842 --> 00:19:11,221
Why cook the rice into a porridge?
We're not gonna make it, either way!

120
00:19:11,363 --> 00:19:14,052
Since we're going to die, let us at
least eat all we can before we do!

121
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,217
Fools! How can you say
such desperate words?

122
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,345
No matter what,
I don't want porridge!

123
00:19:20,936 --> 00:19:25,525
You're gonna give up that easily? How
could you pass yourselves for seamen?

124
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,969
What good would come from persevering?
How can we survive without fuel?

125
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:34,415
Rotten luck!
I feel it in my guts!

126
00:19:35,946 --> 00:19:39,491
How stupid can you get?
I'm not gonna die!

127
00:19:39,615 --> 00:19:41,481
The God Konpira is
watching over me!

128
00:19:41,673 --> 00:19:45,163
Even if the ship is destroyed
and a plank of wood is all that's left...

129
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:49,691
Whatever happens, I'm not gonna die!
The Sea God Konpira is watching over me!

130
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:56,752
Sankichi, never mind if Hachi
and Gorosuke don't want to eat it.

131
00:19:56,807 --> 00:19:59,018
We're having rice porridge
strating tomorrow at breakfast.

132
00:19:59,188 --> 00:20:00,450
Understood?

133
00:20:05,131 --> 00:20:06,647
Bastard!

134
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,771
I should not have let him
convince me to come...

135
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:16,539
I wanted to quit this job, but he said we
could make some quick money before the festival.

136
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:19,961
Bastard!

137
00:20:20,106 --> 00:20:21,907
He fooled me!

138
00:21:32,268 --> 00:21:34,867
Mother Gorosuke?

139
00:21:35,595 --> 00:21:38,347
My father drowned in the Genkai Sea...

140
00:21:39,354 --> 00:21:42,179
when a coal ship sank.

141
00:21:46,278 --> 00:21:49,294
But what an
unlucky bastard you are!

142
00:21:57,673 --> 00:22:00,705
My father is
waiting at the bottom.

143
00:22:01,686 --> 00:22:04,221
Hachizou, you're
gonna die, too!

144
00:22:04,245 --> 00:22:06,169
You'll be food
for fish, too!

145
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:09,706
I won't die! I have
a son waiting for me!

146
00:22:09,859 --> 00:22:12,166
I won't die before
seeing Gorou married!

147
00:22:12,296 --> 00:22:13,148
Sankichi!

148
00:22:13,296 --> 00:22:17,706
You're Kamegorou's nephew, aren't you? You're
in cohorts so the two of you survive, aren't you?

149
00:22:17,813 --> 00:22:22,247
I won't have that! We'll all die together!
I won't be the only one to die!

150
00:22:51,105 --> 00:22:54,053
Hachi! What's
the meaning of this?

151
00:22:56,016 --> 00:22:59,158
Didn't you hear
your captain's orders?

152
00:22:59,616 --> 00:23:04,261
I don't wanna die eating porridge!
I'll have me some proper rice!

153
00:23:07,156 --> 00:23:11,710
Sankichi! Where have you been?
This bird-brain has cooked rice!

154
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:15,053
Bird-brain or not, I want rice!

155
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:16,780
I'll have some, too!

156
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:24,936
Well, if you'll behave like
that, I know just what to do.

157
00:23:25,314 --> 00:23:27,755
From now on, I'll guard
the provisions myself.

158
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:31,220
Sankichi, take all the
rice and miso to my room.

159
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:33,455
Gorosuke's abalone, too!

160
00:23:46,555 --> 00:23:50,082
Now... we have a little
over 6 kilos of rice.

161
00:23:50,553 --> 00:23:53,408
The miso is half full...

162
00:23:53,734 --> 00:23:56,122
One takuan roll...

163
00:23:56,995 --> 00:24:00,071
Two white radishes
with some leaves...

164
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,542
56 eddoes...

165
00:24:03,862 --> 00:24:06,702
23 abalone shells...

166
00:24:08,096 --> 00:24:11,190
3 bottles of water
with 2 litres each...

167
00:24:11,852 --> 00:24:14,433
Now take a good look.

168
00:24:14,542 --> 00:24:19,260
This is what we'll have to live on.
This is the key to our survival.

169
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:48,976
Look at this.

170
00:24:49,133 --> 00:24:51,688
Not a grain of rice left...

171
00:24:52,113 --> 00:24:54,962
We ate all of it in 8 days.

172
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:58,225
And there's less than
a litre of water left.

173
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,704
6 abalone shells...

174
00:25:01,368 --> 00:25:06,327
We'll have to make do with
that and the eddoes and radishes...

175
00:25:06,511 --> 00:25:09,357
Now you know
where we stand.

176
00:25:19,608 --> 00:25:22,101
Shouldn't you peel them?

177
00:25:22,257 --> 00:25:25,180
Stupid! We'll
eat all of it!

178
00:29:21,006 --> 00:29:22,862
Lord Konpira!

179
00:29:22,954 --> 00:29:25,329
Won't you please
make it rain?

180
00:29:25,577 --> 00:29:27,216
Please help us!

181
00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:29,498
Send some rain!

182
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:32,932
<i>Oh, Mighty Lord Konpira
Oh, Mighty Lord Konpira

183
00:31:43,326 --> 00:31:47,041
That's all the water we have...

184
00:31:47,125 --> 00:31:48,612
There's some left!

185
00:31:48,746 --> 00:31:50,385
Yes, there is!

186
00:31:52,211 --> 00:31:55,040
As you can see, just a sip.

187
00:31:55,848 --> 00:32:00,220
We'll use this and some
sea water to make miso soup.

188
00:32:00,527 --> 00:32:04,146
It doesn't taste good if
made with sea water alone.

189
00:32:08,911 --> 00:32:11,724
It's too salty to eat!

190
00:32:11,891 --> 00:32:14,836
We'll only get thirsty!

191
00:32:14,955 --> 00:32:16,936
Sip it slowly.

192
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:20,709
Don't taste it,
swallow it straight away.

193
00:32:32,044 --> 00:32:34,295
Gorosuke, be strong!

194
00:32:42,088 --> 00:32:45,630
Believe it!
We must believe we'll make it!

195
00:32:45,705 --> 00:32:48,940
If we lose our
faith, we'll die...

196
00:32:50,345 --> 00:32:53,608
Uncle...
You really think we can make it?

197
00:32:53,937 --> 00:32:55,377
Of course!

198
00:32:55,528 --> 00:32:57,424
As long as we believe it!

199
00:35:32,871 --> 00:35:36,810
<i>Souvenir from the
Temple of Lord Konpira

200
00:36:26,094 --> 00:36:29,818
Kamegorou!

201
00:36:30,217 --> 00:36:34,752
I bring you water!

202
00:36:35,063 --> 00:36:40,313
Don't worry!

203
00:36:45,347 --> 00:36:49,582
I'll send as much as you can drink!

204
00:36:49,743 --> 00:36:53,072
You'll see!

205
00:36:57,285 --> 00:37:05,635
Kamegorou, it's water!
Have some!

206
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:37,448
Hey! Wake up!
Water! Water!

207
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:42,519
Wake up! Wake up!

208
00:37:42,637 --> 00:37:44,997
Lord Konpira sent me a sign!

209
00:37:45,112 --> 00:37:48,704
He said "Don't worry,
I'll send water!"

210
00:37:48,838 --> 00:37:52,148
And it started to
flow from his fountain!

211
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:56,478
It's gonna rain!
Follow me! It'll rain!

212
00:38:27,279 --> 00:38:30,103
How could it rain on
such a sunny day?

213
00:38:30,197 --> 00:38:34,498
There are no clouds!
Not a drop will fall...

214
00:38:34,695 --> 00:38:37,843
No! It will rain!
I got the sign!

215
00:38:38,069 --> 00:38:39,914
It was just a dream.

216
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:42,465
You can't count
on Lord Konpira.

217
00:38:43,017 --> 00:38:45,707
Sankichi, don't blaspheme!

218
00:38:45,806 --> 00:38:49,079
He's the protector of seamen!
The Lord of the ocean!

219
00:38:49,178 --> 00:38:52,214
You're speaking nonsense!
"Lord Konpira" my ass!

220
00:38:52,364 --> 00:38:55,013
You're going crazy!

221
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,853
Look!
I can see it!

222
00:39:07,574 --> 00:39:11,329
It's a cloud! Sankichi,
bring the binoculars!

223
00:39:14,954 --> 00:39:16,933
Look! I can see it!

224
00:39:17,073 --> 00:39:19,800
I see it, too!
Is it an island?

225
00:39:20,076 --> 00:39:23,124
I can see it!
Is it a ship?

226
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:34,693
Those are clouds!
Rain clouds!

227
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:37,190
It's gonna rain!
It's coming this way!

228
00:39:37,326 --> 00:39:39,176
Rain clouds!

229
00:39:47,373 --> 00:39:49,658
Hachi! Gorosuke! Sankichi!

230
00:39:49,789 --> 00:39:52,568
Those are rain clouds!
Like in Konpira's sign!

231
00:40:35,954 --> 00:40:38,744
Bring the empty barrels!
The bottles!

232
00:41:14,185 --> 00:41:18,570
Hachi! Gorosuke! Sankichi!
You understand it now?

233
00:41:18,854 --> 00:41:22,274
Seeing this marvel!
We mustn't lose heart!

234
00:41:22,411 --> 00:41:25,443
It's proof Lord Konpira
has not turned his back on us!

235
00:41:31,144 --> 00:41:34,782
Let's take this to the bow,
where the wind blows.

236
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:37,462
That will keep it from rotting.

237
00:41:59,758 --> 00:42:04,668
Since you've drank all you could,
you seem to have livened up!

238
00:43:53,324 --> 00:43:55,032
Hachi...

239
00:43:56,213 --> 00:43:59,219
Today makes it 24 days.

240
00:44:00,504 --> 00:44:06,262
You should stop. It's like
counting down to your death.

241
00:44:06,953 --> 00:44:09,843
I can't stand
drinking more water.

242
00:44:13,554 --> 00:44:16,569
I'd like to see
dogs, cats...

243
00:44:16,621 --> 00:44:20,442
Horses, cattle,
mountains, rivers...

244
00:44:21,678 --> 00:44:24,836
It feels like it's
been a thousand years...

245
00:44:31,492 --> 00:44:32,984
Gorosuke...

246
00:44:33,167 --> 00:44:35,535
every single day...

247
00:44:35,928 --> 00:44:41,072
all we've been eating is miso soup that tastes
like water that's been used to wash a wall...

248
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:43,237
But I believe
Kamegorou and Sankichi...

249
00:44:43,595 --> 00:44:47,121
have been secretly eating
from the eddoes and radishes.

250
00:44:47,499 --> 00:44:49,723
Not Kamegorou...

251
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:52,887
He wouldn't do such a thing.

252
00:44:53,068 --> 00:44:55,157
Think about it.

253
00:44:57,706 --> 00:44:59,375
If not...

254
00:44:59,935 --> 00:45:03,180
How could Kamegorou
remain so confident!

255
00:45:03,284 --> 00:45:07,855
He keeps the miso and the
eddoes. What could we do?

256
00:45:08,784 --> 00:45:11,083
You're such a fool!

257
00:45:11,423 --> 00:45:14,421
You'll just accept
things as they are?

258
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:18,182
Gorosuke...

259
00:45:18,394 --> 00:45:21,641
We should keep our share.

260
00:45:21,859 --> 00:45:24,319
So? What ya' say?

261
00:45:24,853 --> 00:45:27,108
Divide the provisions...

262
00:45:27,209 --> 00:45:28,519
Yes.

263
00:45:28,707 --> 00:45:31,296
We should do that.

264
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:35,877
Hachi, let's do it.

265
00:46:04,442 --> 00:46:06,267
Captain Kamegorou?

266
00:46:20,855 --> 00:46:23,547
What? What do
the two of you want?

267
00:46:26,491 --> 00:46:27,850
We...

268
00:46:28,357 --> 00:46:30,910
came to ask
you to split the food.

269
00:46:33,121 --> 00:46:36,518
And why would
you wanna do that?

270
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:39,250
Never mind the reason!
We just want it!

271
00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:43,530
Gorosuke! You too?

272
00:46:49,956 --> 00:46:52,710
Gorosuke! Don't you?

273
00:46:53,803 --> 00:46:56,725
I want it!
Give us our share!

274
00:46:56,875 --> 00:47:00,435
The miso? The eddoes, too?

275
00:47:01,205 --> 00:47:04,165
Yes. Our share in everything.

276
00:47:04,897 --> 00:47:10,224
If I give you your share, you'll eat
all of it at once; It won't last 3 days...

277
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:11,836
It's better than being robbed!

278
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:14,311
What? Robbed?

279
00:47:14,346 --> 00:47:17,467
Yes! We won't be robbed anymore!

280
00:47:18,049 --> 00:47:22,616
You think I'd rob
even a single eddoe?

281
00:47:22,723 --> 00:47:26,023
How should we know?
You keep all of it here!

282
00:47:26,819 --> 00:47:29,581
You've dragged us
into the open sea...

283
00:47:29,726 --> 00:47:32,790
and you keep the best
for yourself and Sankichi?

284
00:47:32,881 --> 00:47:35,397
Not even in death we'd have peace!

285
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:46,503
We've all grown up
on the same beach...

286
00:47:46,971 --> 00:47:50,473
How can you say
such harsh words?

287
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:54,194
Gorosuke! Hachi!

288
00:47:54,946 --> 00:47:59,531
Do you think I'm a man
who'd do such a thing?

289
00:48:00,321 --> 00:48:03,342
We're going to die!
Let us do as we please!

290
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:05,581
No one has saved us so far!

291
00:48:05,790 --> 00:48:08,827
We see no tuna ships,
no airplanes...

292
00:48:08,979 --> 00:48:11,062
We've drifted too far away...

293
00:48:11,126 --> 00:48:13,683
Death has got us on her hand!

294
00:48:13,741 --> 00:48:17,420
I want to eat something!
Just give us our share!

295
00:48:19,299 --> 00:48:21,100
Well...

296
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:24,083
If that's how you feel...

297
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:27,221
Sankichi, the draining basket!

298
00:48:46,038 --> 00:48:48,445
We've eaten all the abalone.

299
00:48:48,612 --> 00:48:51,573
All we've got are
eddoes and miso.

300
00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:39,424
That's 15 each.

301
00:49:39,622 --> 00:49:42,502
So...
No complaints so far?

302
00:49:45,659 --> 00:49:47,950
Now, the miso.

303
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:07,442
Half a radish.

304
00:50:12,329 --> 00:50:14,316
That's all of it.

305
00:50:14,429 --> 00:50:17,638
You can search the
room, if you'd like.

306
00:50:22,467 --> 00:50:24,576
We still have lots of water.

307
00:50:24,762 --> 00:50:28,272
It's on the bow,
drink as much as you like.

308
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:33,732
If you want to live, use the
water to make a thin miso soup.

309
00:50:34,469 --> 00:50:37,362
Wait!
There's that other thing...

310
00:50:49,623 --> 00:50:51,736
These are pickled plum seeds.

311
00:50:51,825 --> 00:50:54,912
I thought they
might come in handy.

312
00:50:55,262 --> 00:51:02,045
There's some taste left in them...
One could add water and make tea.

313
00:51:02,332 --> 00:51:05,447
You can have
half of these, too.

314
00:51:07,088 --> 00:51:09,096
That's 5 for you.

315
00:51:13,610 --> 00:51:18,416
The two of us will sleep in that
compartment over there from now on.

316
00:51:18,858 --> 00:51:20,720
Why?

317
00:51:24,925 --> 00:51:28,602
You're trying to avoid me?

318
00:51:35,141 --> 00:51:39,086
Never mind...
Do as you like.

319
00:51:42,664 --> 00:51:44,727
Just a moment!

320
00:51:46,383 --> 00:51:53,092
I know I'm repeating myself...
But that's all the food we've got!

321
00:51:53,993 --> 00:51:59,780
When that's over, all we'll
have to chew on are the ropes.

322
00:52:00,056 --> 00:52:03,973
Keep that in mind.
Don't forget that!

323
00:52:12,585 --> 00:52:14,100
Bastards!

324
00:52:14,276 --> 00:52:16,812
How can they
say those things!

325
00:52:17,368 --> 00:52:19,801
Let's put our food back.

326
00:52:20,611 --> 00:52:23,382
From now on you'd
better sleep here, too.

327
00:52:42,318 --> 00:52:44,200
We all worked
together during the storm,

328
00:52:44,249 --> 00:52:46,510
But look what happens
when we run out of food!

329
00:52:46,577 --> 00:52:48,780
Sankichi! Shut up!

330
00:52:53,018 --> 00:52:55,319
Not ready yet?

331
00:53:00,279 --> 00:53:02,584
The eddoes are not cooked yet.

332
00:53:03,023 --> 00:53:05,355
Don't lick it like that!

333
00:53:05,412 --> 00:53:06,738
I have to check for salt!

334
00:53:06,845 --> 00:53:08,641
There's no need!

335
00:53:08,837 --> 00:53:10,751
Then you lick it, too!

336
00:53:11,992 --> 00:53:13,878
Should I use more miso?

337
00:53:13,933 --> 00:53:15,699
It's fine!

338
00:53:19,166 --> 00:53:21,396
Quit doing that!

339
00:53:22,279 --> 00:53:23,919
Delicious!

340
00:53:24,051 --> 00:53:27,556
We'll finally have some
soup that tastes like soup!

341
00:53:27,884 --> 00:53:32,178
I don't want to wait for the
eddoes! Let me have some!

342
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:16,262
We settled on five each, right?

343
00:54:16,365 --> 00:54:19,194
You saw it with your
own eyes, didn't you?

344
00:54:35,244 --> 00:54:38,927
How about you?
Watcha' waiting for?

345
00:54:39,472 --> 00:54:42,493
I'll wait
for the eddoes.

346
00:55:01,207 --> 00:55:04,034
Uncle, let's eat!

347
00:55:24,502 --> 00:55:26,924
That was great!

348
00:55:27,777 --> 00:55:31,740
I can feel it in my stomach!

349
00:55:32,231 --> 00:55:35,927
It'd been a while since I'd
had food you can actually chew.

350
00:55:36,898 --> 00:55:38,866
You should eat, too!

351
00:55:39,027 --> 00:55:42,183
Not just yet. I'll wait
till it's well cooked...

352
00:55:42,235 --> 00:55:44,250
And creamy...

353
00:55:59,662 --> 00:56:01,219
Uncle?

354
00:56:02,038 --> 00:56:04,404
Will we survive?

355
00:56:04,426 --> 00:56:08,510
Sure we will. Lord Konpira
is watching over us.

356
00:56:09,195 --> 00:56:13,397
Won't they eat all their food
and come asking for ours?

357
00:56:13,501 --> 00:56:17,310
Don't worry.
I'd never let that happen.

358
00:57:06,392 --> 00:57:09,272
Well cooked?

359
00:57:09,929 --> 00:57:14,647
Yes! And creamy...

360
00:57:15,883 --> 00:57:17,938
Let me have one!

361
00:57:18,031 --> 00:57:21,073
No way! You've
eaten your share!

362
00:57:21,445 --> 00:57:24,671
I'll pay you back!
It's just a loan!

363
00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:27,272
Nonsense! What would
you pay me with?

364
00:57:27,390 --> 00:57:30,583
Whatever food is left,
belongs to both of us.

365
00:57:32,572 --> 00:57:34,936
I have money!
I'll pay you!

366
00:57:35,122 --> 00:57:38,018
Money is
no good out here.

367
00:57:50,802 --> 00:57:53,272
Then finish quickly!

368
00:57:56,416 --> 00:58:00,582
You shouldn't eat so slowly
on purpose, like that.

369
00:58:00,631 --> 00:58:04,716
Wether I'm slow or fast,
that's my own business.

370
00:58:04,772 --> 00:58:09,053
The slower I eat,
the more it will last.

371
00:58:19,413 --> 00:58:20,670
Hachi!

372
00:58:20,712 --> 00:58:22,475
What are you doing over there?

373
00:58:22,561 --> 00:58:24,247
I'm not doing anything!

374
00:58:27,507 --> 00:58:29,496
You've licked some miso!

375
00:58:29,669 --> 00:58:31,335
No, I haven't!

376
00:58:31,815 --> 00:58:33,810
I just looked at it.

377
00:58:33,844 --> 00:58:35,277
I can look, can't I?

378
00:58:35,376 --> 00:58:37,545
Don't touch the food!

379
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:39,852
It's mine, too!

380
00:58:39,888 --> 00:58:44,049
Gorosuke...
Let's eat 5 more...

381
00:58:44,334 --> 00:58:47,263
Eating so little
makes me hungrier!

382
00:58:48,211 --> 00:58:52,628
Stupid! If we eat like
that, it won't last two days!

383
00:58:53,529 --> 00:58:58,720
We won't make it... There aren't
even tuna ships around...

384
00:58:58,782 --> 00:59:01,987
We've come to a cursed place!

385
00:59:02,373 --> 00:59:06,372
Since we're doomed anyway,
why not eat properly?

386
00:59:08,038 --> 00:59:12,820
C'mon, Gorosuke...
Let's eat!

387
00:59:16,405 --> 00:59:19,987
If you won't eat, I'll just
have the whole thing myself!

388
01:00:14,753 --> 01:00:18,157
Uncle?
Wanna change?

389
01:00:54,421 --> 01:00:55,594
Uncle?

390
01:00:55,682 --> 01:00:58,398
It's been 28 days.

391
01:00:58,470 --> 01:01:02,005
That much? 28?

392
01:01:02,486 --> 01:01:08,643
It's impressive humans can
survive that long on so little...

393
01:01:12,427 --> 01:01:14,597
Uncle?

394
01:01:17,264 --> 01:01:20,690
We can't go
on like this...

395
01:01:20,833 --> 01:01:25,409
We'll die...

396
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:29,078
Sankichi!

397
01:01:29,491 --> 01:01:31,235
You're a man!

398
01:01:31,717 --> 01:01:33,633
Don't despair!

399
01:01:34,462 --> 01:01:38,825
I'm scared! I'm scared!

400
01:01:38,951 --> 01:01:41,148
Focus on surviving!

401
01:01:41,278 --> 01:01:43,369
Fight death!

402
01:01:43,409 --> 01:01:45,275
I'm scared!

403
01:01:45,812 --> 01:01:50,486
Think of the things to come!
About getting married!

404
01:01:52,001 --> 01:01:56,263
How can a man die without
having slept with a woman?

405
01:01:56,442 --> 01:01:59,498
I'm scared!

406
01:03:12,436 --> 01:03:14,102
Jerk!

407
01:03:18,297 --> 01:03:22,373
Why not?
We'll die anyway...

408
01:03:22,534 --> 01:03:25,638
Not with you...

409
01:04:33,806 --> 01:04:35,434
Sankichi!

410
01:04:43,257 --> 01:04:44,817
What?

411
01:04:45,356 --> 01:04:50,662
In your compartment, there's
still lots of food, isn't there?

412
01:04:51,407 --> 01:04:52,611
How's that?

413
01:04:52,656 --> 01:04:58,154
Don't lie! When the division was made,
the two of you hid it somewhere.

414
01:04:58,287 --> 01:05:02,159
Impossible! The captain
would never do that!

415
01:05:02,218 --> 01:05:03,604
Liar!

416
01:05:04,065 --> 01:05:06,806
You're still having soup!

417
01:05:07,208 --> 01:05:09,261
What soup?

418
01:05:10,376 --> 01:05:13,637
All we've had since yesterday
morning is plum seed water...

419
01:06:35,762 --> 01:06:37,682
What are you chewing?

420
01:06:38,127 --> 01:06:39,849
Gorosuke!

421
01:06:45,137 --> 01:06:46,496
I see...

422
01:06:47,182 --> 01:06:49,495
Pickled plum seed...

423
01:07:00,957 --> 01:07:05,764
I've had it for so long,
I can't taste anything anymore.

424
01:07:07,597 --> 01:07:10,425
Why do you keep it in your mouth?

425
01:07:11,546 --> 01:07:14,616
It helps time pass...

426
01:08:30,685 --> 01:08:33,182
I'm so hungry!

427
01:08:33,263 --> 01:08:35,424
I want to eat!

428
01:08:40,072 --> 01:08:42,577
Some sukiyaki...

429
01:08:43,897 --> 01:08:46,395
rice cakes...

430
01:08:47,306 --> 01:08:49,351
Anything...

431
01:08:51,414 --> 01:08:53,290
I want to eat!

432
01:08:58,626 --> 01:09:01,749
I WANT TO EAT!

433
01:10:25,874 --> 01:10:32,803
That skewered chicken tasted so nice...

434
01:10:45,882 --> 01:10:51,713
I could eat... a whole shank...

435
01:10:52,827 --> 01:10:56,437
All by myself...

436
01:12:15,926 --> 01:12:20,900
I think...
I might lose my mind.

437
01:13:50,397 --> 01:13:53,149
<i>Oh, Mighty Lord Konpira
Oh, Mighty Lord Konpira

438
01:13:54,057 --> 01:13:57,475
<i>Oh, Mighty Lord Konpira
Oh, Mighty Lord Konpira...

439
01:14:11,457 --> 01:14:12,944
Gorosuke?

440
01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:16,267
Don't say anything.

441
01:14:16,411 --> 01:14:18,062
It makes me hungry...

442
01:14:20,414 --> 01:14:22,899
Let's talk...

443
01:14:23,517 --> 01:14:26,316
Silence is scary...

444
01:14:33,264 --> 01:14:35,341
Didn't you say...

445
01:14:35,654 --> 01:14:39,073
You've tried monkey meat?

446
01:14:40,145 --> 01:14:45,253
A long time ago...
During the typhus epidemic...

447
01:14:46,393 --> 01:14:51,421
A relative who's already died
brought it home and gave us some.

448
01:14:51,530 --> 01:14:55,471
He said it was a spell to
protect us from the fever.

449
01:14:56,377 --> 01:14:58,830
How did it taste?

450
01:15:02,347 --> 01:15:05,261
How it tasted?

451
01:15:05,326 --> 01:15:09,948
All four-legged animals taste alike...

452
01:15:12,748 --> 01:15:15,702
You say badger meat stinks?

453
01:15:17,634 --> 01:15:20,802
But raccoon dogs taste nice.

454
01:15:21,214 --> 01:15:23,468
I heard snakes are good, too.

455
01:15:24,256 --> 01:15:26,295
So they say...

456
01:15:26,997 --> 01:15:31,077
The lumberjacks in
the forests of Hyuga...

457
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:35,963
dip them in sweet soy
sauce and broil them.

458
01:15:36,492 --> 01:15:40,135
They say it's
much better than eel.

459
01:15:44,134 --> 01:15:46,207
If prepared right...

460
01:15:46,245 --> 01:15:49,643
you could eat just any creature...

461
01:15:50,276 --> 01:15:52,626
No doubt about it...

462
01:15:53,336 --> 01:15:55,427
During the war...

463
01:15:56,675 --> 01:16:01,212
people ate worms,
lizzards and insects...

464
01:16:04,176 --> 01:16:08,276
Don't come near me.
You stink!

465
01:16:17,275 --> 01:16:19,530
I wonder...

466
01:16:20,050 --> 01:16:23,549
What a person would taste like...

467
01:16:26,905 --> 01:16:31,906
They say it's like pomegranates...

468
01:16:32,912 --> 01:16:37,117
It's probably better than that...

469
01:16:37,501 --> 01:16:39,314
You think so?

470
01:16:39,899 --> 01:16:42,554
That it tastes good?

471
01:16:42,697 --> 01:16:45,164
I'm sure of it.

472
01:16:52,926 --> 01:16:57,615
Fish and cattle taste good.

473
01:16:59,159 --> 01:17:02,280
Why would humans be an exception?

474
01:17:02,963 --> 01:17:05,039
That makes sense...

475
01:17:05,155 --> 01:17:07,189
Of course it does...

476
01:17:09,738 --> 01:17:15,149
Let's stop!
This food talk is making me hungrier!

477
01:17:16,421 --> 01:17:17,679
Gorosuke...

478
01:17:19,063 --> 01:17:21,042
It isn't just "talk"...

479
01:17:21,683 --> 01:17:24,623
If we set our minds to it...

480
01:17:24,767 --> 01:17:27,825
We can have lots of good food to eat...

481
01:17:33,471 --> 01:17:34,927
Sankichi.

482
01:17:37,380 --> 01:17:40,176
What about him?

483
01:17:44,339 --> 01:17:48,177
Even now... I don't
think I could do it...

484
01:17:48,637 --> 01:17:52,640
Easily said, you hypocrite!

485
01:17:53,145 --> 01:17:56,534
The truth is you want it!

486
01:18:06,007 --> 01:18:07,523
Hachi...

487
01:18:08,833 --> 01:18:11,179
That's too much.

488
01:18:12,012 --> 01:18:13,803
Fool!

489
01:18:14,342 --> 01:18:19,377
If we don't do it to them,
they will do it to us.

490
01:18:20,818 --> 01:18:27,012
Those two have already robbed us
of so much miso and eddoes...

491
01:18:28,909 --> 01:18:32,019
That alone would justify it.

492
01:18:35,259 --> 01:18:36,895
Gorosuke...

493
01:18:37,887 --> 01:18:40,758
If we were to starve to death...

494
01:18:43,576 --> 01:18:47,032
They'd eat the two of us.

495
01:22:18,839 --> 01:22:20,091
Sankichi!

496
01:22:27,093 --> 01:22:28,420
What?

497
01:22:35,321 --> 01:22:38,539
I've been keeping
an eddoe for you...

498
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:40,515
Come get it!

499
01:22:41,233 --> 01:22:43,758
Who'd have an eddoe by now?

500
01:22:43,951 --> 01:22:45,534
Don't tease me!

501
01:22:45,660 --> 01:22:48,635
Silly! What would
I gain from lying to you?

502
01:22:49,718 --> 01:22:53,919
I found them yesterday, in a
straw bag in the middle of the junk pile.

503
01:22:54,321 --> 01:22:58,754
There were three of them,
so I've kept one for you...

504
01:22:59,066 --> 01:23:01,130
You should thank me!

505
01:23:01,491 --> 01:23:03,331
Ain't that right, Gorosuke?

506
01:23:06,066 --> 01:23:07,294
Sankichi...

507
01:23:07,730 --> 01:23:09,446
It's true!

508
01:23:09,695 --> 01:23:11,086
See...

509
01:23:11,588 --> 01:23:13,479
Come down here!

510
01:23:19,442 --> 01:23:22,503
Sankichi!
What are you waiting for?

511
01:23:24,660 --> 01:23:26,643
Come down here...

512
01:23:27,584 --> 01:23:28,938
It's true?

513
01:23:29,264 --> 01:23:31,070
Of course...

514
01:23:31,275 --> 01:23:33,162
It' already cooked!

515
01:23:47,153 --> 01:23:48,479
Let me have it!

516
01:23:48,627 --> 01:23:50,014
Give it to me!

517
01:23:50,212 --> 01:23:51,701
It's in the pan.

518
01:24:44,155 --> 01:24:45,640
Sankichi?

519
01:24:49,764 --> 01:24:50,815
Sankichi?

520
01:24:54,384 --> 01:24:55,624
Sankichi!

521
01:24:56,460 --> 01:24:57,337
Quick!

522
01:24:58,385 --> 01:25:00,285
We have to hide the body!

523
01:25:10,140 --> 01:25:11,207
Sankichi?

524
01:25:23,762 --> 01:25:24,855
Sankichi!

525
01:25:32,634 --> 01:25:33,568
Hachi!

526
01:25:33,671 --> 01:25:35,278
Gorosuke!

527
01:25:35,422 --> 01:25:37,097
Where's Sankichi?

528
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:38,770
Give him back!

529
01:25:47,216 --> 01:25:49,316
Hachi! Gorosuke!

530
01:25:49,406 --> 01:25:51,946
What have you done with Sankichi?
Why won't you answer me?

531
01:25:52,085 --> 01:25:54,586
Have you done
something you can't tell me about?

532
01:25:54,609 --> 01:25:55,864
Shut up!

533
01:25:56,505 --> 01:26:00,274
How the hell should
we know where Sankichi is!

534
01:26:01,022 --> 01:26:02,651
I know it!

535
01:26:03,137 --> 01:26:07,266
You've... killed him, haven't you?

536
01:26:07,895 --> 01:26:09,116
Haven't you?

537
01:26:09,549 --> 01:26:10,716
Haven't you?

538
01:26:19,358 --> 01:26:20,680
Hachi!

539
01:26:21,048 --> 01:26:22,255
Hachi!

540
01:26:22,358 --> 01:26:24,463
Hachi! Gorosuke!

541
01:26:25,306 --> 01:26:28,828
You've... killed Sankichi, haven't you?

542
01:26:31,300 --> 01:26:32,817
Come up here.

543
01:26:32,919 --> 01:26:34,382
Out here on the deck.

544
01:26:34,445 --> 01:26:35,964
I'll deal with you!

545
01:26:36,127 --> 01:26:38,053
I'll avenge Sankichi!

546
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:41,762
What's the matter?
Why won't you answer?

547
01:26:42,248 --> 01:26:44,732
Bastards! Cowards!

548
01:26:45,053 --> 01:26:47,310
Animals! Pieces of shit!

549
01:26:49,031 --> 01:26:50,942
Hachi, don't!

550
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:54,238
-Don't do it!
-Let me go!

551
01:26:55,537 --> 01:26:58,368
He'll kill us if
I don't get him first!

552
01:27:00,442 --> 01:27:02,293
Hachi! Don't!

553
01:27:03,684 --> 01:27:08,097
Hachi! Gorosuke!
Come up! Come up!

554
01:27:08,747 --> 01:27:10,932
Let go! Let go!

555
01:27:27,646 --> 01:27:30,837
Kamegorou! I will not deny it!

556
01:27:31,406 --> 01:27:33,446
We've killed Sankichi!

557
01:27:33,726 --> 01:27:35,604
We've killed him to eat him!

558
01:27:35,792 --> 01:27:37,872
And so what?

559
01:27:38,086 --> 01:27:41,850
You barbarians! Monsters!

560
01:27:42,064 --> 01:27:44,001
And who's
to blame for that?

561
01:27:44,177 --> 01:27:46,110
If you're so hungry for meat...

562
01:27:46,282 --> 01:27:48,077
Eat your own!

563
01:28:14,849 --> 01:28:16,522
Hachi! Stop!

564
01:28:16,746 --> 01:28:20,181
Put the cleaver down!
We brought this on!

565
01:28:20,267 --> 01:28:23,828
Killing Sankichi was wrong,
no matter the circumstances!

566
01:28:24,015 --> 01:28:27,418
We should starve
before we eat human flesh!

567
01:28:28,051 --> 01:28:30,483
Sankichi, forgive us!

568
01:28:30,746 --> 01:28:32,512
Captain Kamegorou!

569
01:28:32,671 --> 01:28:37,315
Have mercy! Mercy!

570
01:28:40,392 --> 01:28:43,799
I beg forgiveness!
On my knees, I beg!

571
01:28:44,252 --> 01:28:48,939
I'm so scared of Sankichi's spirit!

572
01:29:20,062 --> 01:29:21,821
Sankichi...

573
01:29:22,423 --> 01:29:25,786
Won't you please forgive
Hachizou and Gorosuke?

574
01:29:26,451 --> 01:29:28,926
And forgive me, too?

575
01:29:29,342 --> 01:29:32,100
We'd all turned into monsters...

576
01:29:33,016 --> 01:29:35,651
We were no longer human...

577
01:30:23,985 --> 01:30:28,495
The sun seems like
it just won't set today...

578
01:32:08,477 --> 01:32:10,047
Gorosuke!

579
01:32:12,933 --> 01:32:17,203
Sankichi...
Please forgive us!

580
01:32:17,459 --> 01:32:19,432
Don't cry, Gorosuke!

581
01:32:35,491 --> 01:32:36,791
Hachi!

582
01:32:45,683 --> 01:32:48,663
It's Sankichi!
We're being punished!

583
01:32:56,118 --> 01:32:58,595
<i>Oh, Mighty Lord Konpira
Oh, Mighty Lord Konpira

584
01:32:59,231 --> 01:33:01,511
<i>Oh, Mighty Lord Konpira
Oh, Mighty Lord Konpira...

585
01:33:26,668 --> 01:33:29,888
Captain!

586
01:33:34,566 --> 01:33:36,050
Captain!

587
01:33:37,449 --> 01:33:38,721
Hachi?

588
01:33:39,359 --> 01:33:41,428
Please open!

589
01:33:48,382 --> 01:33:52,302
Captain Kamegorou, please open!

590
01:33:59,304 --> 01:34:00,911
What do you want?

591
01:34:01,367 --> 01:34:03,436
Please open!

592
01:34:05,195 --> 01:34:08,187
The waves are
breaking on the deck!

593
01:34:08,251 --> 01:34:10,433
Please let us in!

594
01:34:49,264 --> 01:34:55,654
I'll allow you two to stay in here,
but you must take all your clothes off.

595
01:34:56,935 --> 01:35:00,295
I have no knives on me...

596
01:35:00,838 --> 01:35:04,583
Hachi, how about you?

597
01:35:09,158 --> 01:35:10,258
Hachi!

598
01:35:10,324 --> 01:35:12,294
What's this? What's this?

599
01:35:16,429 --> 01:35:21,046
Hachi! Why did you
have a cleaver on you?

600
01:35:21,556 --> 01:35:24,810
I didn't intend to use it...

601
01:35:25,573 --> 01:35:30,573
I was afraid you'd try to
avenge Sankichi and attack me...

602
01:35:31,095 --> 01:35:33,739
Is that the truth?

603
01:35:34,507 --> 01:35:35,500
Hachi!

604
01:35:35,608 --> 01:35:39,677
Why didn't you give it
to the captain right away?

605
01:35:44,354 --> 01:35:46,015
Kamegorou...

606
01:36:08,546 --> 01:36:11,302
We'd better throw these
out to the sea!

607
01:36:27,860 --> 01:36:32,112
You two should use that
rope to tie yourselves...

608
01:36:32,606 --> 01:36:36,273
We're so weak that
being thrown about could kill us!

609
01:36:52,244 --> 01:36:53,991
Tightly, now.

610
01:37:08,929 --> 01:37:10,347
The knot!

611
01:37:22,523 --> 01:37:28,192
I'm evoking Lord Konpira,
so that we'll be saved.

612
01:37:28,892 --> 01:37:32,732
How do you do that?

613
01:37:33,784 --> 01:37:35,748
You don't have to
say it out loud...

614
01:37:36,068 --> 01:37:38,621
Just concentrate on it.

615
01:37:39,427 --> 01:37:42,965
After the horrible
thing we've done to Sankichi...

616
01:37:43,403 --> 01:37:48,244
There's no way Lord Konpira
will listen to our pleas...

617
01:37:50,123 --> 01:37:53,731
Why didn't I stop Hachi?

618
01:37:54,323 --> 01:37:58,278
We were like beasts...

619
01:38:24,080 --> 01:38:26,744
Sankichi...

620
01:38:28,262 --> 01:38:31,387
Please forgive us...

621
01:38:31,534 --> 01:38:33,269
Sankichi...

622
01:38:33,889 --> 01:38:37,557
It was all my fault, Sankichi...

623
01:38:47,413 --> 01:38:53,081
Sankichi! Sankichi!

624
01:38:53,418 --> 01:38:57,020
Forgive us, Sankichi...

625
01:38:59,960 --> 01:39:01,497
Sankichi...

626
01:39:02,456 --> 01:39:04,132
I'm to blame...

627
01:39:04,473 --> 01:39:07,237
I'm sorry, Sankichi...

628
01:39:09,120 --> 01:39:10,745
Sankichi!

629
01:40:17,458 --> 01:40:18,785
Hachi!

630
01:40:34,985 --> 01:40:40,243
The storm has passed.

631
01:40:41,633 --> 01:40:45,467
Hachi, hang on!

632
01:41:03,644 --> 01:41:05,342
Gorosuke!

633
01:41:18,676 --> 01:41:21,994
The storm is over.

634
01:42:28,962 --> 01:42:32,757
Gorosuke! It's water!

635
01:42:36,416 --> 01:42:38,175
Don't give up!

636
01:42:45,806 --> 01:42:48,821
Hachi! Hachi!

637
01:42:55,848 --> 01:42:57,677
Have some water.

638
01:43:00,124 --> 01:43:01,400
Here!

639
01:43:06,120 --> 01:43:10,268
Hachi and Gorosuke,
you mustn't quit.

640
01:43:10,661 --> 01:43:14,128
I think we might be saved.

641
01:43:14,852 --> 01:43:20,436
Lord Konpira appeared
in my dreams last night.

642
01:43:20,924 --> 01:43:23,420
Like that other time...

643
01:43:24,118 --> 01:43:28,637
He was standing by my side.

644
01:43:29,241 --> 01:43:34,049
A ship, on its way back
from San Francisco...

645
01:43:34,894 --> 01:43:38,474
has changed its course
due to a typhoon...

646
01:43:38,619 --> 01:43:43,626
and should be somewhere
in this area today...

647
01:43:44,929 --> 01:43:52,380
You're lying to
try to give us strenght.

648
01:43:52,507 --> 01:43:56,344
It's not a lie.
That's what he said.

649
01:43:56,924 --> 01:44:03,610
If you doubt it, we'll be punished
and good fortune will slip away.

650
01:44:05,588 --> 01:44:08,129
Did you really see him?

651
01:44:08,397 --> 01:44:10,855
Would I lie to you?

652
01:44:10,893 --> 01:44:15,252
Now, we must be strong.
Let's climb to the deck.

653
01:44:15,999 --> 01:44:19,817
If we stay down here like this, we'll die.

654
01:44:20,015 --> 01:44:21,739
Stand up!

655
01:44:24,965 --> 01:44:26,233
Fool!

656
01:44:30,160 --> 01:44:31,657
Get up!

657
01:44:31,936 --> 01:44:36,585
We've survived for
too long to die like this.

658
01:44:37,096 --> 01:44:39,055
Up! Up!

659
01:44:39,481 --> 01:44:41,781
Let's climb out.

660
01:44:43,227 --> 01:44:45,019
Outside!

661
01:45:51,993 --> 01:45:53,668
Can you see anything?

662
01:45:53,982 --> 01:45:56,254
There's nothing to see!

663
01:46:00,334 --> 01:46:04,388
If Lord Konpira was
any help at all, we'd already...

664
01:46:23,254 --> 01:46:25,279
A ship! A ship!

665
01:46:26,466 --> 01:46:28,072
I can see it!

666
01:46:32,485 --> 01:46:34,450
Hachi! Gorosuke!

667
01:46:34,550 --> 01:46:35,872
It's coming!

668
01:46:35,974 --> 01:46:37,105
It's coming our way!

669
01:46:37,160 --> 01:46:38,725
A ship!

670
01:46:38,757 --> 01:46:41,237
<i>Oh, Mighty Lord Konpira
Oh, Mighty Lord Konpira...

671
01:46:45,991 --> 01:46:49,551
Hachi! Gorosuke!
This is Lord Konpira's doing!

672
01:46:49,721 --> 01:46:52,857
Thank him! Thank him!
And wave your hands! Wave them!

673
01:47:49,753 --> 01:47:51,727
Were you adrift?

674
01:47:56,025 --> 01:47:57,514
Are you Japanese?

675
01:47:59,573 --> 01:48:00,892
Get aboard!

676
01:48:01,635 --> 01:48:04,223
H-Helps us...

677
01:48:05,516 --> 01:48:07,550
Scum! Stand up!

678
01:48:07,847 --> 01:48:09,458
Or else I'll leave you here!

679
01:48:09,627 --> 01:48:12,026
Wait!

680
01:48:16,962 --> 01:48:20,330
Quick! Lazy people will
be thrown overboard!

681
01:48:31,110 --> 01:48:34,528
I yelled at you to keep you
from letting go and dying.

682
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:37,026
Please don't take it to heart.

683
01:48:37,546 --> 01:48:39,633
Don't worry about a thing.

684
01:48:39,792 --> 01:48:42,314
We'll arrive in Yokohama
in two weeks time.

685
01:48:43,258 --> 01:48:46,750
You mustn't talk for now.
You should rest.

686
01:48:54,623 --> 01:48:56,947
So... do you feel better?

687
01:48:58,793 --> 01:49:02,413
You should take that beard
back home with you as a souvenir!

688
01:49:18,057 --> 01:49:20,496
59 days...

689
01:49:21,649 --> 01:49:23,870
It's amazing you've survived...

690
01:49:24,521 --> 01:49:26,908
I'm impressed
you haven't gone mad.

691
01:49:27,286 --> 01:49:30,790
Where is this
ship coming from?

692
01:49:31,225 --> 01:49:33,976
We're on our way back
from San Francisco...

693
01:49:39,542 --> 01:49:43,333
There was a typhoon,
so we had to wait around.

694
01:49:46,677 --> 01:49:50,368
But I guess our bad luck was
your lucky break, huh?

695
01:49:51,662 --> 01:49:53,797
Captain Kamegorou...

696
01:49:55,374 --> 01:49:56,626
What is it?

697
01:49:58,373 --> 01:50:02,144
I'm sorry I doubted
Lord Konpira's message.

698
01:50:03,002 --> 01:50:05,821
I am scared.

699
01:50:09,972 --> 01:50:17,055
I just said those things
to keep you two from quitting...

700
01:50:17,354 --> 01:50:19,304
Don't worry...

701
01:50:22,125 --> 01:50:27,074
Is that true, Captain Kamegorou?

702
01:50:27,916 --> 01:50:35,980
I believe in Lord Konpira,
so I dreamed with him a lot.

703
01:50:36,859 --> 01:50:42,611
But I never dreamed
about a ship from San Francisco.

704
01:50:42,902 --> 01:50:48,546
On the other hand,
things went exactly as I said...

705
01:50:49,483 --> 01:50:53,175
So he must have inspired me.

706
01:50:54,966 --> 01:51:00,081
Lord Konpira will
probably punish us!

707
01:51:00,459 --> 01:51:04,565
You're right. We will pay!

708
01:51:06,448 --> 01:51:11,036
Lord Konpira is not
such a vengeful god.

709
01:51:11,377 --> 01:51:15,155
He's saved all of us, hasn't he?

710
01:51:25,907 --> 01:51:28,422
You're being silly...

711
01:51:29,339 --> 01:51:34,511
You two should just
forget all that's happened.

712
01:51:35,379 --> 01:51:38,148
Don't think about it...

713
01:51:59,103 --> 01:52:01,532
Hachi! Gorosuke!

714
01:52:01,851 --> 01:52:03,897
You should see this!

715
01:52:04,247 --> 01:52:08,790
I can see Ohshima!
We're back!

716
01:52:10,931 --> 01:52:16,887
Look! It's Ohshima!
And Mount Mihara!

717
01:52:17,911 --> 01:52:20,411
We've made it back alive!

718
01:52:27,095 --> 01:52:31,504
I knew we would make it!

719
01:52:31,710 --> 01:52:37,297
We're back! We're back!
We're finally back!

720
01:52:37,739 --> 01:52:40,392
Sankichi! We're back!

721
01:52:41,195 --> 01:52:42,844
Sankichi!

722
01:52:44,708 --> 01:52:46,261
We're back!

723
01:52:46,670 --> 01:52:48,509
Aren't you glad, Sankichi?

724
01:52:48,685 --> 01:52:50,812
Let's dance! Let's dance!

725
01:52:50,952 --> 01:52:53,236
Sankichi! We're back!

726
01:52:53,826 --> 01:52:58,430
Gorosuke! What's the matter?
Don't lose control!

727
01:53:00,720 --> 01:53:03,676
Let's dance, Sankichi!

728
01:53:04,089 --> 01:53:06,378
Dance! Dance!

729
01:53:07,751 --> 01:53:08,794
Gorosuke!

730
01:54:10,292 --> 01:54:13,455
The woman, Gorosuke.
She went mad?

731
01:54:14,530 --> 01:54:15,666
Correct.

732
01:54:15,786 --> 01:54:18,636
She went mad,
and then fell off?

733
01:54:20,242 --> 01:54:21,416
Correct.

734
01:54:21,564 --> 01:54:23,418
Why did she go mad?

735
01:54:24,425 --> 01:54:25,889
I don't know...

736
01:54:25,976 --> 01:54:29,683
The boy, Sankichi, he got
sick and died while you were lost?

737
01:54:29,896 --> 01:54:31,588
Exactly.

738
01:54:31,817 --> 01:54:33,714
What were the symptoms?

739
01:54:34,782 --> 01:54:37,570
After we ran out of food...

740
01:54:37,888 --> 01:54:40,194
He developed a fever...

741
01:54:41,146 --> 01:54:43,367
You're telling the truth?

742
01:54:43,835 --> 01:54:46,949
Yes. That's exactly what happened.

743
01:54:47,459 --> 01:54:52,172
-And you threw his body overboard?
-Yes. That's what we did.

744
01:54:54,728 --> 01:54:59,586
We wrapped him in a raincoat,
and committed him to the sea...

745
01:55:01,088 --> 01:55:03,501
That's the whole truth.

746
01:55:09,161 --> 01:55:10,218
Hachi!

747
01:55:17,324 --> 01:55:19,863
Sankichi!

748
01:55:58,018 --> 01:56:04,270
The End
