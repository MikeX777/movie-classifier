1
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:14,548
(lightning strikes)

2
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:18,319
(dramatic music)

3
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,404
(sirens sound)

4
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:43,677
(dramatic music)

5
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:05,599
- [Man] He's heading
 across the field.

6
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:09,170
(dramatic music)

7
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:31,425
He's doubled back onto the road.

8
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:33,394
Let's go.

9
00:01:33,394 --> 00:01:37,265
(dramatic music)

10
00:01:58,986 --> 00:02:02,656
(engine starts)

11
00:02:04,892 --> 00:02:08,862
(dramatic music)

12
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,972
(train horn sounds)

13
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:28,676
(dramatic music)

14
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:45,259
(sirens sound)

15
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:09,049
He's gotta be around
 here somewhere.

16
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:10,484
Keep your eyes open.

17
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:13,454
(bird calls)

18
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:23,631
Ma'am.

19
00:04:23,631 --> 00:04:24,965
There's an escaped
 convict on the loose

20
00:04:24,965 --> 00:04:25,999
and we're pretty
 sure he came onto

21
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:27,568
your property from the beach.

22
00:04:27,568 --> 00:04:29,136
He's a killer, lady.

23
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:31,004
- I haven't seen anyone.

24
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:33,441
But you're welcome
 to look around.

25
00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:45,218
(bird calls)

26
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,430
(dramatic music)

27
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,140
- What'd he do, bury himself?

28
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,310
(dramatic music)

29
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,480
Are you sure you haven't
seen anything, lady?

30
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,849
(dramatic music)

31
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:18,419
(bird calls)

32
00:05:20,421 --> 00:05:21,555
- I think I saw him.

33
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:23,156
He's down there.

34
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:26,694
(dramatic music)

35
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:28,562
Hold it!

36
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:30,330
Stop or I'll shoot!

37
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:34,001
(dramatic music)

38
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,574
- That wasn't very
 smart, Pascal.

39
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:42,309
Come on, back to your cage.

40
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:46,079
(dramatic music)

41
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,892
- Take it easy now,
 you hear, Alex?

42
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:40,127
- Likewise, buddy.

43
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:41,028
- Don't worry, I'll see
you tomorrow morning.

44
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:43,163
Come by about 10:00.

45
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:50,270
(dog growling)

46
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:55,776
(dog barking)

47
00:07:57,377 --> 00:07:59,379
- Hey, Bart, leave him alone.

48
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:00,781
Down, boy, down.

49
00:08:00,781 --> 00:08:03,884
(dog barking)

50
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:05,285
Come back here.

51
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:06,854
Come on, come on,
 come back here.

52
00:08:06,854 --> 00:08:09,189
(bird calls)

53
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:11,825
Well, well, well,
 if it isn't Lucille.

54
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:12,926
What do you keep in that?

55
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:14,562
Come on, remember old Michel?

56
00:08:14,562 --> 00:08:15,929
Or have I changed that much?

57
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:17,364
- You're Michel?

58
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:19,432
The Michel?

59
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:22,570
- Now, now, I haven't seen
 you since uncle Andre's.

60
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,638
Well you seem fine.

61
00:08:24,638 --> 00:08:26,774
It is

62
00:08:26,774 --> 00:08:28,008
Hey, who's the doll?

63
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:30,077
- [Lucille] That uncle
 Andre's daughter.

64
00:08:30,077 --> 00:08:31,111
- [Michel] Falesse?

65
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:32,179
(laughing)

66
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,647
Well look at her.

67
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:36,516
Why 13 years ago, you
 only came up to my elbow.

68
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,318
I'm your cousin MIchel.

69
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:39,620
The meanie.

70
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,088
I always used to tease
 the pants off of you.

71
00:08:41,088 --> 00:08:42,355
Don't you remember?

72
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,724
You used to yell, Michel!

73
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:44,892
- Uh-uh.

74
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:45,826
Who cares?

75
00:08:45,826 --> 00:08:46,594
Cousins are always welcome.

76
00:08:46,594 --> 00:08:47,360
- Get a kiss?

77
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,228
- Of course.

78
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:51,131
(laughing)

79
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:55,068
- What brings you here, Michel?

80
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:57,605
- Ah, I'm just passing
 through on business.

81
00:08:57,605 --> 00:08:59,372
But I travel a lot for
pleasure too, of course.

82
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,608
(laughing)

83
00:09:00,608 --> 00:09:01,541
You know how it is
 when you get older,

84
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,876
you get a little nostalgic.

85
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,277
- Good morning, it
 looks like your dog's

86
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:06,113
made himself right
 at home already.

87
00:09:06,113 --> 00:09:07,648
- Morning.

88
00:09:07,648 --> 00:09:09,750
Doesn't say too much for his
 master's manners, does it?

89
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,918
(laughing)

90
00:09:10,918 --> 00:09:12,385
- [Lucille] Come on in, Michel.

91
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,087
I see you don't recognize Colin.

92
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:17,390
- Oh your son, no,
 he's pretty grown up.

93
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:22,262
Here's to you, Andre.

94
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:27,267
Ah he's truly a great
 man, you know that, Colin?

95
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:28,602
- Sure.

96
00:09:28,602 --> 00:09:29,903
In his own way.

97
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:32,606
- You were too young.

98
00:09:32,606 --> 00:09:35,508
Too young to really know him.

99
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:39,146
After all, you were only
 five or six when it happened.

100
00:09:39,146 --> 00:09:41,715
- Colin was eight at the time.

101
00:09:41,715 --> 00:09:45,052
- Yep, little Colin was
just eight years old.

102
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:46,920
Not very experienced
 but still old enough

103
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,922
to remember how the
 supreme master Andre

104
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:53,026
who had survived so many
of the squalls of life,

105
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:54,795
ended up drowning like a rat.

106
00:09:54,795 --> 00:09:57,197
- Colin.

107
00:09:57,197 --> 00:09:58,365
You.

108
00:09:58,365 --> 00:10:01,234
(laughing)

109
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:02,469
Don't talk about
 father like that,

110
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:04,337
I won't permit it.

111
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:06,473
- Why so sensitive, m'lady?

112
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:09,810
What's important is you've
 inherited his fortune and us.

113
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:12,846
Your underlings, who stand
 always to kiss your feet.

114
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:16,449
(dramatic music)

115
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:19,687
- [Lucille] Colin.

116
00:10:19,687 --> 00:10:23,423
(dramatic music)

117
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,429
(laughing)

118
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:30,864
I always warned him,
it was bound to get him

119
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:32,933
sooner or later, didn't I?

120
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:35,068
(dramatic music)

121
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:37,137
- Sure.

122
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,940
He loved to challenge the sea.

123
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,609
To try to master it.

124
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:45,078
He was a true sportsman.

125
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:48,882
How we all admired him.

126
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:52,786
Especially his
 daughter, Falesse.

127
00:10:52,786 --> 00:10:56,724
And then that morning, the
 coast guard got a report

128
00:10:56,724 --> 00:11:00,660
of a cabin cruiser
 adrift unmanned.

129
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,930
Maybe the motor had broken down.

130
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:06,299
And he'd made a desperate
 attempt to swim ashore.

131
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:09,770
The sea had always been his
 idol and it became his tomb.

132
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:13,640
(dramatic music)

133
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,182
- [Man2] (Latin spoken)

134
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,818
- [Colin] Amen.

135
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:29,456
(laughing)

136
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:32,159
- Well look at the sort of
 thing I carry around with me.

137
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:35,428
A bunch of knickknacks,
like this number here.

138
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:37,197
Why don't you try
 it on for size, huh?

139
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,832
Picked it up at the
 fair, the phono fair,

140
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:40,267
you know, in Copenhagen?

141
00:11:40,267 --> 00:11:41,735
You should see the
goodies they got there.

142
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:43,236
- It's a living jewel.

143
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:44,772
- Go on, put it on your arm.

144
00:11:44,772 --> 00:11:47,240
(laughing)

145
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,608
How's it feel?

146
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:50,277
Titillating, isn't it?

147
00:11:50,277 --> 00:11:51,945
A friend of mine
 went buggy over it.

148
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:54,381
(laughing)

149
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:57,150
- You're sweet.

150
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,551
- Throw it in here.

151
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,953
Kiki will be terribly tickeld.

152
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:01,221
- Kiki?

153
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,856
- And Kioko, we have two
vultures in the family.

154
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:04,691
I'm trying to satisfy
 their appetite.

155
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:07,360
Drives him to destruction.

156
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,964
- They go for innards, feet,
 vertebrae, sacred bones.

157
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:12,265
Real cuisine.

158
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:14,334
(laughing)

159
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:18,071
- To give a fellow like
that bones, you need

160
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,307
a cemetery practically.

161
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:21,574
- Practically.

162
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,609
- You got one?

163
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:25,412
Fascinated.

164
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:28,181
- If you really want to see
 it, it's as good as done.

165
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:31,284
- Good.

166
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:32,519
- [Falesse] We found
 some Etruscan tombs

167
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:33,787
right here on the ground.

168
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:35,022
- [Michel] Any gold?

169
00:12:35,022 --> 00:12:36,156
- Nope, it had
 already been looted.

170
00:12:36,156 --> 00:12:37,090
There.

171
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,125
(laughing)

172
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,192
Think he'll get titillated?

173
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:40,360
- Why not?

174
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,428
(laughing)

175
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:42,863
Get in there, titillate.

176
00:12:42,863 --> 00:12:44,297
(laughing)

177
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:45,398
You know that skull
 looks like an old friend.

178
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:46,934
(laughing)

179
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:49,803
- Come on, what's happened
 to your great appetite?

180
00:12:49,803 --> 00:12:51,504
What is this, a hunger strike?

181
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:55,042
Come on, take it.

182
00:12:55,042 --> 00:12:56,643
What's the matter?

183
00:12:56,643 --> 00:12:58,611
(dog barking)

184
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:02,215
(dramatic music)

185
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:26,206
(bird calls)

186
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:33,246
(dramatic music)

187
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:37,384
- Well uncle Alfans.

188
00:13:37,384 --> 00:13:41,054
(dog growling)

189
00:13:45,859 --> 00:13:49,362
(bird calls)

190
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,673
(whistling)

191
00:14:02,109 --> 00:14:03,576
- It sounded like your dog
 was trembling with joy.

192
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:05,278
I bet he's met a girlfriend.

193
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:07,080
- Ah, he sure has
 a way with women.

194
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,116
If I were half as successful.

195
00:14:09,116 --> 00:14:10,483
- At titillating?

196
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:11,919
- Yeah.

197
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:13,186
- [Falesse] Don't despair,
 Michel, the night's

198
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,888
still young, you may
 have the same luck.

199
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:18,225
(dramatic music)

200
00:14:18,225 --> 00:14:19,792
- A stroll in the moonlight?

201
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:24,064
(dramatic music)

202
00:14:24,064 --> 00:14:26,967
How romantic.

203
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:29,702
I'd be the last to
 want to interrupt you.

204
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,538
I'll retire.

205
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:33,273
Goodnight.

206
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:36,076
(laughing)

207
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:47,420
- "Dear Derek.

208
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:50,023
All well, road clear,
 come immediately."

209
00:14:50,023 --> 00:14:52,993
Okay.

210
00:14:52,993 --> 00:14:55,428
Motel Hilton.

211
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:06,706
(dramatic music)

212
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,502
(lightning strikes)

213
00:15:35,502 --> 00:15:38,938
(dramatic music)

214
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:48,415
(groaning)

215
00:15:57,457 --> 00:16:00,393
(screaming)

216
00:16:00,393 --> 00:16:04,164
(dramatic music)

217
00:17:04,057 --> 00:17:05,258
- "Dear, Derek.

218
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:07,460
All well, road clear,
 come immediately."

219
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,629
What does it mean?

220
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:12,799
And who's Derek?

221
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,167
(laughing)

222
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:18,438
- [Colin] Oh well, that's funny.

223
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:20,006
- Who's Derek?

224
00:17:20,006 --> 00:17:22,175
Doesn't ring any bells.

225
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:24,844
Unless possibly it's--

226
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:28,281
- Who?

227
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:29,649
- No one.

228
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:31,118
Just a stupid thought.

229
00:17:31,118 --> 00:17:32,652
(laughing)

230
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:35,021
- Let Kiki devour
 it, he loves paper.

231
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:36,089
He's neglected.

232
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:39,092
(laughing)

233
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:43,029
- No it's going
 to be sent to him.

234
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:46,065
It's the best thing.

235
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:51,738
This Derek knows
 that Michel was here.

236
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:56,008
And if he gets Michel's note,
 he won't get suspicious.

237
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:59,779
And he'll pop right down,
 and we'll clear this all up.

238
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:02,615
All up.

239
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:07,920
- Another order for
 soaps heads, hmm?

240
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,857
I'll mail it.

241
00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:27,907
(bird calls)

242
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:44,991
- Ah.

243
00:18:44,991 --> 00:18:47,727
Hi there, you mothers.

244
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:49,462
(laughing)

245
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,531
You want some too?

246
00:18:51,531 --> 00:18:54,701
Yeah great bastards.

247
00:18:54,701 --> 00:18:58,838
(bird calls)

248
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:02,942
(clock chiming)

249
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,819
Anyone home?

250
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:16,456
(dramatic music)

251
00:19:56,263 --> 00:19:59,699
(whistling)

252
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:03,270
(dramatic music)

253
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:17,049
- Who are you?

254
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,118
- You the boss lady here?

255
00:20:19,118 --> 00:20:20,186
- I asked first.

256
00:20:20,186 --> 00:20:21,788
- Cigarette?

257
00:20:21,788 --> 00:20:22,922
- Well?

258
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:26,359
- Name's Alex, Alex Borland.

259
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:27,594
Mm-mm.

260
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:29,462
Hey Michel wasn't kidding.

261
00:20:29,462 --> 00:20:31,264
This is one beautiful villa.

262
00:20:31,264 --> 00:20:32,799
By the way, where is Michel?

263
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,635
He said to come here at 10:30
 and here he is standing me up.

264
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:37,203
Where are you hiding him?

265
00:20:37,203 --> 00:20:40,840
In your bed?

266
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,175
- What are you talking about?

267
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:45,378
- About Michel.

268
00:20:45,378 --> 00:20:47,747
And about his dog.

269
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:51,751
This is Buck's collar.

270
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,387
Look if Michel
 and I are friends,

271
00:20:54,387 --> 00:20:56,489
and Michel is your
 cousin, the two of us

272
00:20:56,489 --> 00:21:00,327
can be open with
 each other, can't we?

273
00:21:00,327 --> 00:21:01,961
- I suppose so.

274
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:05,031
Michel received a
 call from London.

275
00:21:05,031 --> 00:21:06,999
- An emergency,
 story of my life.

276
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:08,635
- So he called a
 taxi and he left.

277
00:21:08,635 --> 00:21:10,470
But he did say to
 expect company.

278
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:13,172
And he asked us to welcome
 you, just like a cousin.

279
00:21:13,172 --> 00:21:15,041
Oh here, would you like me
 to light your cigarette?

280
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,008
- Huh?

281
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:16,909
Oh no, I don't smoke.

282
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:19,245
(laughing)

283
00:21:19,245 --> 00:21:20,547
- You collect
 people's cigarettes?

284
00:21:20,547 --> 00:21:22,915
- It's just a thing I
 have, like for women.

285
00:21:22,915 --> 00:21:24,016
- Would you like to come in?

286
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:25,518
- With great pleasure.

287
00:21:25,518 --> 00:21:27,720
Though I'm warning you,
 you're taking a big risk.

288
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,557
I'm a Casanova, a dive
 in the wool Don Juan

289
00:21:30,557 --> 00:21:33,092
and women can't resist me.

290
00:21:33,092 --> 00:21:36,496
(laughing)

291
00:21:39,432 --> 00:21:40,933
- Oh.

292
00:21:40,933 --> 00:21:43,302
- When I'm with a beautiful
girl, I'm like a man possessed.

293
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,805
I'm no amateur,
 I've got technique.

294
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:47,940
You'll see.

295
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,876
- [Falesse] Are you
 always like this?

296
00:21:49,876 --> 00:21:51,711
- [Alex] Generosity
 is my major failing.

297
00:21:51,711 --> 00:21:55,081
(laughing)

298
00:21:55,081 --> 00:21:56,383
I'll show you later.

299
00:21:56,383 --> 00:21:58,418
(laughing)

300
00:21:58,418 --> 00:21:59,285
- Get out!

301
00:21:59,285 --> 00:22:00,453
- Colin?

302
00:22:00,453 --> 00:22:04,524
- We don't need
 parasites around here.

303
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,497
- That's a jealous house
boy you've got there.

304
00:22:12,298 --> 00:22:16,536
- I apologize for his behavior.

305
00:22:16,536 --> 00:22:19,706
This gentleman's my guest.

306
00:22:19,706 --> 00:22:23,242
And no one else's.

307
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,646
- That was a very
impressive performance.

308
00:22:26,646 --> 00:22:29,749
- Thank you.

309
00:22:40,493 --> 00:22:41,828
- [Colin] The sun king
 said a hearty appetite

310
00:22:41,828 --> 00:22:43,596
is a sign of verility.

311
00:22:43,596 --> 00:22:45,798
- The way you quote,
 you must be a writer.

312
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:49,101
- No, I passed my time living.

313
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:52,104
That's a hard enough
 job in itself.

314
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:55,041
- Colin is the
 epitome of an artist.

315
00:22:56,576 --> 00:22:59,211
He writes, sculpts, and paints.

316
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,313
This is one of his.

317
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:04,283
And that one, and that
 one, and that one.

318
00:23:04,283 --> 00:23:07,754
And he interprets Elliot
 and Locker like nobody else.

319
00:23:07,754 --> 00:23:11,424
Don't you agree, Lucille?

320
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:17,430
- It's shameful and disgusting.

321
00:23:18,865 --> 00:23:22,168
- Must be sort of juice
stuff then, huh, Colin?

322
00:23:22,168 --> 00:23:24,370
- Oh yes.

323
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:25,538
You want to hear it?

324
00:23:25,538 --> 00:23:27,373
- Sure, why not?

325
00:23:27,373 --> 00:23:30,577
You've made me curious.

326
00:23:41,654 --> 00:23:43,155
- Yesterday's bit.

327
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:45,892
- That's a good way to keep
 the kids out of trouble, huh?

328
00:23:48,027 --> 00:23:50,296
To cut off artistic
 drive is wicked.

329
00:23:50,296 --> 00:23:52,231
- [Woman] Give me your lips.

330
00:23:52,231 --> 00:23:54,366
Yes.

331
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:55,968
Oh.

332
00:23:55,968 --> 00:23:57,103
Harder.

333
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:59,438
- It's a tremendous recording.

334
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,741
It even picks up the
 pages being turned.

335
00:24:01,741 --> 00:24:03,976
(moaning)

336
00:24:03,976 --> 00:24:07,847
(upbeat music)

337
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,051
- [Man2] When a lovely
 woman invites you

338
00:24:12,051 --> 00:24:15,822
to madness, and the
room vertically crosses.

339
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:21,661
- [Woman] Soft music
 enchants like a gentle mist.

340
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:25,832
- [Man2] Within
 you, in your flesh.

341
00:24:25,832 --> 00:24:29,235
What trembling, what arms.

342
00:24:29,235 --> 00:24:31,337
- [Woman] What
 heaven without truth?

343
00:24:31,337 --> 00:24:34,306
- [Man2] What heaven,
 garden of my agony?

344
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:38,477
From your veins,
 blood flows to my lips

345
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,980
and quenches my--

346
00:24:43,282 --> 00:24:46,418
(laughing)

347
00:24:49,388 --> 00:24:52,792
To see you nude, is
 to remember the earth.

348
00:24:52,792 --> 00:24:56,095
- [Woman] The thread bare
 earth, limped with horses.

349
00:24:56,095 --> 00:24:58,898
- [Man2] Your belly
 is a storm of roots.

350
00:24:58,898 --> 00:25:02,234
- [Woman] Your lips are
 the dark, livid with light.

351
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:05,271
- [Man2] Under the
tepid roses of the bed,

352
00:25:05,271 --> 00:25:09,375
the dead awaiting in vain,
 the hot breath of love.

353
00:25:11,544 --> 00:25:15,047
You fling the covers
 away, lie back,

354
00:25:15,047 --> 00:25:19,051
and offer yourself, waiting
 for the night to arouse

355
00:25:20,486 --> 00:25:23,723
the 1,000-sorted throbbings
 on which your soul feeds.

356
00:25:23,723 --> 00:25:27,894
(dramatic music)

357
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:45,344
- Now why'd you do that?

358
00:25:46,846 --> 00:25:50,282
To cut off artistic
 drive is wicked.

359
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:04,631
Here, this is what you need now.

360
00:26:07,366 --> 00:26:08,768
- You think so, huh?

361
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:11,771
Ask Colin if he thinks
 this will do me.

362
00:26:18,377 --> 00:26:19,445
What are you two waiting for?

363
00:26:19,445 --> 00:26:21,180
You can go.

364
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:24,116
Go.

365
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:33,059
Your room is right this way.

366
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:34,894
What would you like to
 help you go to sleep?

367
00:26:34,894 --> 00:26:35,962
Soft music?

368
00:26:35,962 --> 00:26:37,196
A book?

369
00:26:37,196 --> 00:26:38,297
- [Alex] I have
 my own technique.

370
00:26:38,297 --> 00:26:40,399
I'll teach it to you.

371
00:26:46,172 --> 00:26:49,308
(dramatic music)

372
00:26:50,677 --> 00:26:52,511
- [Colin] Borland.

373
00:26:52,511 --> 00:26:56,015
(dramatic music)

374
00:26:59,151 --> 00:27:01,353
Do you know the praying mantis,

375
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:03,189
the role of the male?

376
00:27:03,189 --> 00:27:07,126
If you don't go,
 you'll play that role.

377
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:09,028
- Go away.

378
00:27:09,028 --> 00:27:10,529
- You have my warning.

379
00:27:10,529 --> 00:27:13,399
- You sure you're not a writer?

380
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:15,067
(laughing)

381
00:27:15,067 --> 00:27:18,337
(dramatic music)

382
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:28,147
Oh no you don't.

383
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:29,782
You little bitch, so
 this is your kick?

384
00:27:29,782 --> 00:27:31,984
Spilling a guy's guts.

385
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:34,754
This is what happened
 to Michel, isn't it?

386
00:27:34,754 --> 00:27:36,588
Huh?

387
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:40,727
(dramatic music)

388
00:27:41,627 --> 00:27:44,530
You killed him, didn't you?

389
00:27:46,232 --> 00:27:49,035
(laughing)

390
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:52,905
- [Falesse] How dare
 you touch my hair.

391
00:27:52,905 --> 00:27:54,673
Only my father can touch it.

392
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:57,844
(laughing)

393
00:27:59,912 --> 00:28:01,480
- And the carriage
 turned into a pumpkin,

394
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,415
why the masquerade, Cinderella?

395
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:05,217
Golden locks.

396
00:28:05,217 --> 00:28:07,787
- [Falesse] Only father.

397
00:28:07,787 --> 00:28:08,988
My hair.

398
00:28:08,988 --> 00:28:11,891
(laughing)

399
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,996
You're hurting me.

400
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:22,568
(laughing)

401
00:28:35,614 --> 00:28:39,118
(dramatic music)

402
00:29:02,341 --> 00:29:05,511
Father, only father can do it.

403
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,549
- My darling Falesse, with
 your hair of shining gold,

404
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:12,885
soft and fine as silk.

405
00:29:12,885 --> 00:29:16,522
(dramatic music)

406
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,694
- [Falesse] Father?

407
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:25,497
Father what are you
 doing to Lucille?

408
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:27,834
Let her go.

409
00:29:27,834 --> 00:29:29,135
No.

410
00:29:29,135 --> 00:29:31,137
Don't hold me so tight.

411
00:29:31,137 --> 00:29:32,805
You're hurting me.

412
00:29:32,805 --> 00:29:33,840
No!

413
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,441
No!

414
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:37,209
Why, father?

415
00:29:37,209 --> 00:29:39,345
What are you doing, father?

416
00:29:39,345 --> 00:29:42,148
No, let me go!

417
00:29:42,148 --> 00:29:44,516
Father, let me go!

418
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:48,020
(dramatic music)

419
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,196
(screaming)

420
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:00,132
Why?

421
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:02,134
Why?

422
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:03,769
Why?

423
00:30:03,769 --> 00:30:05,204
What are you doing to me?

424
00:30:05,204 --> 00:30:06,873
Tell me.

425
00:30:06,873 --> 00:30:10,109
Tell me, father.

426
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,882
What's this emptiness around me?

427
00:30:15,882 --> 00:30:18,084
You deserted me again.

428
00:30:18,084 --> 00:30:21,720
(upbeat music)

429
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:32,198
- Would you get me a reservation

430
00:30:32,198 --> 00:30:33,699
on the next plane to Zurich?

431
00:30:33,699 --> 00:30:34,500
- Mm-hmm.

432
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,467
- Thank you.

433
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:36,869
- There's one this evening, sir.

434
00:30:36,869 --> 00:30:39,872
(upbeat music)

435
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:52,384
(laughing)

436
00:31:17,944 --> 00:31:20,346
- Were hung by the
 chimney with care,

437
00:31:20,346 --> 00:31:23,715
in hopes that Saint Nicholas
 soon would be there.

438
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:26,785
The children were nestled,
 all snug in their bed,

439
00:31:26,785 --> 00:31:30,656
while visions of sugar
 plums danced in their heads.

440
00:31:32,024 --> 00:31:34,893
- [Man3] Where there is offense,
let me bring forgiveness.

441
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,428
- Is she fit to travel, doctor?

442
00:31:36,428 --> 00:31:37,563
- All things considered, I
 should think that would be

443
00:31:37,563 --> 00:31:39,398
all right.

444
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:42,434
An emotional shock could
 make her withdrawal further.

445
00:31:42,434 --> 00:31:44,770
Although it might cure her.

446
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:47,006
That's her there.

447
00:31:48,374 --> 00:31:50,676
- And ran to the window,
quick as a flash,

448
00:31:50,676 --> 00:31:53,712
tore open the shudder,
 threw up the sash.

449
00:31:53,712 --> 00:31:56,748
When what to my wandering
 eyes did appear,

450
00:31:56,748 --> 00:32:00,019
but a miniature sled
and eight tiny reindeer.

451
00:32:00,019 --> 00:32:02,921
The driver himself, a
 right jolly old elf,

452
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,157
and I laughed when I--

453
00:32:05,157 --> 00:32:07,826
- These bloom
 three times a year.

454
00:32:07,826 --> 00:32:10,029
But only in this pot.

455
00:32:10,029 --> 00:32:11,263
Now why is that?

456
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:12,698
Strange, isn't it?

457
00:32:12,698 --> 00:32:14,300
- That's because
 plants are sensitive.

458
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:17,836
Show a plant that you care,
 and then it likes to come out.

459
00:32:19,138 --> 00:32:21,373
- They remind me of
the way Michel smelled.

460
00:32:21,373 --> 00:32:23,942
- [Colin] Michel reincarnated
 as a Chrysanthemum .

461
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,677
Jumping the gun a
 bit, aren't you, baby?

462
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:26,878
- [Falesse] What?

463
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:29,081
- Madame, psychosis takes time.

464
00:32:29,081 --> 00:32:30,316
- [Falesse] What do you mean?

465
00:32:30,316 --> 00:32:32,284
You don't think
 he's coming back?

466
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:34,320
- Why, don't you believe
in reincarnation?

467
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,356
- But that's, that's
 Alex's sweater.

468
00:32:37,356 --> 00:32:38,357
- Really?

469
00:32:38,357 --> 00:32:39,591
I inherited it from him.

470
00:32:39,591 --> 00:32:41,027
- [Falesse] Liar, take it off.

471
00:32:41,027 --> 00:32:43,229
When he does come
 back, you'll be sorry.

472
00:32:43,229 --> 00:32:44,663
Take it off.

473
00:32:44,663 --> 00:32:45,464
- [Lucille] Silence, you're
 both being ridiculous.

474
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:47,733
There is no Alex.

475
00:32:47,733 --> 00:32:50,736
(phone ringing)

476
00:32:50,736 --> 00:32:52,804
- [Colin] Don't.

477
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,173
I'll answer it.

478
00:32:54,173 --> 00:32:56,642
(phone ringing)

479
00:32:56,642 --> 00:32:57,709
- [Pascal] Kid?

480
00:32:57,709 --> 00:32:58,677
- Yes.

481
00:32:58,677 --> 00:33:00,179
- [Pascal] Ah you're home, good.

482
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:01,413
Then we can have a little party,

483
00:33:01,413 --> 00:33:03,515
I'm on my way.

484
00:33:03,515 --> 00:33:05,951
- You're not welcome
 here, bud, shove it.

485
00:33:05,951 --> 00:33:09,521
(dramatic music)

486
00:33:12,891 --> 00:33:14,560
- [Falesse] What's
 wrong with me?

487
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,195
I feel a huge emptiness.

488
00:33:16,195 --> 00:33:19,265
It makes me feel, I don't
 know like I'm falling.

489
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:23,935
Like I'm falling, getting dizzy.

490
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:27,039
All the time, why?

491
00:33:28,707 --> 00:33:31,110
Why?

492
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:34,012
I want to scream and struggle
 but I don't know why.

493
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:38,384
(dramatic music)

494
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,700
- Kid.

495
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,402
(laughing)

496
00:33:56,402 --> 00:33:59,438
Hello, friend, what
 happened to my little party?

497
00:33:59,438 --> 00:34:02,174
(laughing)

498
00:34:02,174 --> 00:34:03,975
On your feet.

499
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:05,911
You heard!

500
00:34:05,911 --> 00:34:07,213
Inside.

501
00:34:07,213 --> 00:34:09,815
And behave yourself, huh?

502
00:34:09,815 --> 00:34:12,318
I beg your pardon,
 madam, I thought you'd be

503
00:34:12,318 --> 00:34:14,052
expecting me.

504
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,788
(dramatic music)

505
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:20,126
May I?

506
00:34:20,126 --> 00:34:23,262
Get up!

507
00:34:23,262 --> 00:34:25,664
Move!

508
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:28,800
Ah, what's this, a
 little chick-a-dee?

509
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,370
(laughing)

510
00:34:32,371 --> 00:34:33,739
(screaming)

511
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:35,707
Oh pipe down, everybody's here.

512
00:34:35,707 --> 00:34:37,343
- No!

513
00:34:37,343 --> 00:34:39,411
- Everybody but you know who.

514
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:42,514
- No, Colin!

515
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,317
No!

516
00:34:45,317 --> 00:34:46,918
- Stop, brat, or
 I'll break your head.

517
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,020
I wasn't in jail 13
 years for nothing.

518
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:51,323
I'm a specialist.

519
00:34:51,323 --> 00:34:53,359
(laughing)

520
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:55,894
I heard a lot of things while
 I was at the country club,

521
00:34:55,894 --> 00:34:58,730
like about the blackmail
mob run by Mr. A.,

522
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:00,532
better known as Andre.

523
00:35:00,532 --> 00:35:03,569
Now there was a true big shot.

524
00:35:03,569 --> 00:35:06,238
- If it's money you want,
 there's none in the house.

525
00:35:06,238 --> 00:35:10,876
- What do you take me for,
 a two-bit punk, huh, brat?

526
00:35:10,876 --> 00:35:12,378
- If it's not money,
 than what it is?

527
00:35:12,378 --> 00:35:15,080
(laughing)

528
00:35:16,882 --> 00:35:19,151
Take what you want and get out.

529
00:35:19,151 --> 00:35:20,686
(laughing)

530
00:35:20,686 --> 00:35:23,622
- The past 13 years
haven't aged you at all.

531
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:25,457
You're almost as lovely
 as the night you were out

532
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:28,327
by the statue digging, just
 before the cops came by

533
00:35:28,327 --> 00:35:31,197
and found me hiding
 in your bushes.

534
00:35:31,197 --> 00:35:34,065
- Where'd you think that
up, the country club?

535
00:35:34,065 --> 00:35:36,235
- Oh I thought you'd
 remember, I do.

536
00:35:36,235 --> 00:35:40,239
Cops might have got me, but
 not before I saw it all.

537
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:42,241
Shall I refresh your memory?

538
00:35:42,241 --> 00:35:44,142
How about a cabin cruiser
 headed out to sea,

539
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:47,346
with no one aboard?

540
00:35:48,514 --> 00:35:51,550
And the train, and how
about a beautiful woman

541
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:54,586
digging a grave
 for her fellow man?

542
00:35:54,586 --> 00:35:57,223
Better known as Andre.

543
00:35:58,324 --> 00:36:02,461
As they say, silence is golden.

544
00:36:02,461 --> 00:36:05,030
Now $100,000 for 13
years of golden silence

545
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:08,734
is nothing, why don't
 we make it $200,000

546
00:36:08,734 --> 00:36:10,202
and a gift here.

547
00:36:10,202 --> 00:36:11,970
(laughing)

548
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:13,272
- No, let her alone.

549
00:36:13,272 --> 00:36:16,408
(laughing)

550
00:36:17,876 --> 00:36:20,646
- You and me are going to
 wind up real good friends.

551
00:36:23,048 --> 00:36:24,783
Here, have a slug.

552
00:36:24,783 --> 00:36:26,385
I want you to be happy.

553
00:36:26,385 --> 00:36:29,521
(laughing)

554
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:32,891
Coming back to the
 business at hand.

555
00:36:34,293 --> 00:36:36,462
I spent 13 years in jail,
 never opened my mouth.

556
00:36:36,462 --> 00:36:39,365
Now I could call it
 quits for $100,000.

557
00:36:39,365 --> 00:36:41,267
But let's think of the future.

558
00:36:41,267 --> 00:36:43,269
Now for another
 $100,000 I could let

559
00:36:43,269 --> 00:36:45,904
Mr. A rot in peace
 happily ever after.

560
00:36:45,904 --> 00:36:47,806
- Now look, you, will
 you listen to reason?

561
00:36:47,806 --> 00:36:49,308
- You're being unreasonable.

562
00:36:49,308 --> 00:36:51,577
And I've had it.

563
00:36:51,577 --> 00:36:54,446
$200,000 or else the
police will come looking

564
00:36:54,446 --> 00:36:57,849
for the corpse and you'll all
 end up in prison for life.

565
00:36:57,849 --> 00:37:00,452
Or if you prefer, you
 can all end up with Mr. A

566
00:37:00,452 --> 00:37:03,389
underneath the garden,
just keep that in mind.

567
00:37:03,389 --> 00:37:04,823
- Could I ask you, Mr.--

568
00:37:04,823 --> 00:37:06,024
- Pascal.

569
00:37:06,024 --> 00:37:07,793
After the philosopher.

570
00:37:07,793 --> 00:37:09,961
- This cadaver you
 say is in the garden.

571
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:11,830
It couldn't' be that
 you're mistaken.

572
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:14,300
It's all an unconscious
trick of your memory.

573
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,634
- There's one way to find out.

574
00:37:15,634 --> 00:37:18,103
After all, maybe I
 was drunk that night.

575
00:37:18,103 --> 00:37:21,373
This way.

576
00:37:21,373 --> 00:37:24,510
But if I wasn't
 drunk, well let's go!

577
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:26,878
A little digging
 won't hurt you any.

578
00:37:26,878 --> 00:37:30,148
Especially since you're
used to it, right?

579
00:37:30,148 --> 00:37:33,485
(laughing)

580
00:37:48,667 --> 00:37:51,837
Put your weight into it.

581
00:37:51,837 --> 00:37:54,773
Go on, dig.

582
00:37:58,644 --> 00:38:01,913
(bird calls)

583
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:06,852
Give it here.

584
00:38:06,852 --> 00:38:08,420
Time for you to take
 a turn, chick-a-dee,

585
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,656
and work yourself
 up a few blisters.

586
00:38:10,656 --> 00:38:12,391
Get to work, no
 tricks, understand?

587
00:38:12,391 --> 00:38:14,292
Stay cool.

588
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:17,262
(laughing)

589
00:38:22,768 --> 00:38:25,070
(bird calls)

590
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,472
At least your pets
 know I'm right.

591
00:38:26,472 --> 00:38:28,674
They can smell a
 corpse a mile away.

592
00:38:30,609 --> 00:38:32,344
(laughing)

593
00:38:33,345 --> 00:38:36,982
(bird calls)

594
00:38:38,584 --> 00:38:41,119
(dramatic music)

595
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:44,956
(bird calls)

596
00:38:46,392 --> 00:38:48,760
Okay, come on, brat, let's
 see how many bones are left.

597
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,762
Hurry it up.

598
00:38:50,762 --> 00:38:54,500
(dramatic music)

599
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,034
- [Colin] Is this what
 you're looking for?

600
00:38:56,034 --> 00:38:57,703
(bird calls)

601
00:38:57,703 --> 00:38:59,471
- It's Michel's dog.

602
00:38:59,471 --> 00:39:02,641
(dramatic music)

603
00:39:02,641 --> 00:39:04,443
- $200,000 for this?

604
00:39:04,443 --> 00:39:07,946
(bird calls)

605
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,654
- Will you admit that
 you're wrong now?

606
00:39:15,654 --> 00:39:16,955
- Shut your beak, you two.

607
00:39:16,955 --> 00:39:20,325
(bird calls)

608
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,529
It was right by the
statue, I'm sure of it.

609
00:39:23,529 --> 00:39:25,063
I'm no idiot.

610
00:39:25,063 --> 00:39:28,066
I bet you think you played
 it cool by moving the body

611
00:39:28,066 --> 00:39:29,935
but you better think twice!

612
00:39:29,935 --> 00:39:32,538
- We're not buying any of
 your threats, so get out!

613
00:39:32,538 --> 00:39:34,005
- Not buying?

614
00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:35,240
Well then, I'm gonna have
 you dig up every inch

615
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,709
of this estate until
 you hit pay dirt.

616
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:41,346
(bird calls)

617
00:39:41,346 --> 00:39:42,247
You asked for it, damn you.

618
00:39:42,247 --> 00:39:45,316
(gunshots)

619
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:48,319
(dramatic music)

620
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:51,222
(bird calls)

621
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,301
- Kioka.

622
00:40:03,301 --> 00:40:06,805
(bird calls)

623
00:40:07,706 --> 00:40:09,307
Kioka.

624
00:40:09,307 --> 00:40:12,911
(bird calls)

625
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:15,681
I'll kill you!

626
00:40:29,127 --> 00:40:31,663
- Colin!

627
00:40:48,614 --> 00:40:52,183
(dramatic music)

628
00:41:04,129 --> 00:41:05,897
(gasping)

629
00:41:05,897 --> 00:41:08,233
Colin, Colin the pistol.

630
00:41:08,233 --> 00:41:09,701
(dramatic music)

631
00:41:09,701 --> 00:41:10,836
Colin!

632
00:41:10,836 --> 00:41:12,470
Colin, watch out!

633
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,072
(dramatic music)

634
00:41:14,072 --> 00:41:16,307
(screaming)

635
00:41:17,776 --> 00:41:20,712
(bird calls)

636
00:41:25,651 --> 00:41:27,118
(gasping)

637
00:41:27,118 --> 00:41:30,121
- Punk brat, you
 try that once more,

638
00:41:30,121 --> 00:41:32,924
just once, and you're dead.

639
00:41:32,924 --> 00:41:35,193
(bird calls)

640
00:41:35,193 --> 00:41:37,195
Into the house.

641
00:41:37,195 --> 00:41:40,599
(bird calls)

642
00:41:55,547 --> 00:41:57,949
Waiter, get us some whiskey.

643
00:41:57,949 --> 00:42:00,986
We'll all have a drink then
 we'll go back to digging.

644
00:42:04,222 --> 00:42:06,858
Mr. A's going to pop
 up sooner or later.

645
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:09,595
(laughing)

646
00:42:12,998 --> 00:42:16,334
First the ladies.

647
00:42:16,334 --> 00:42:19,638
You've gotta learn
 some manners, brat.

648
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:27,478
All right, hurry
 it up, slow poke.

649
00:42:27,478 --> 00:42:29,447
My lips are getting chapped.

650
00:42:29,447 --> 00:42:31,883
(laughing)

651
00:42:38,924 --> 00:42:42,594
Let's all drink to freedom.

652
00:42:42,594 --> 00:42:45,563
Ah, after 13 years of
 prison, I got a right to.

653
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:48,934
No brats to wait on
 you inside, no sir.

654
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:52,671
Ah.

655
00:42:57,208 --> 00:42:59,678
Well that's water
 under the bridge.

656
00:42:59,678 --> 00:43:02,380
Let's have a little music.

657
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:09,921
(upbeat music)

658
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,262
- Hello, operator,
 get me the police.

659
00:43:17,262 --> 00:43:18,429
- Dumb, bitch.

660
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:21,933
Hold it, you two.

661
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:24,435
Wasn't very smart, was it?

662
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:28,339
Another trick like that,
 and I'll hang you with this.

663
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:30,008
Over there!

664
00:43:30,008 --> 00:43:33,478
(upbeat music)

665
00:43:38,817 --> 00:43:41,386
- [Falesse] Pig!

666
00:43:41,386 --> 00:43:43,822
- You.

667
00:43:43,822 --> 00:43:47,458
Tie them up, one to the other.

668
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:51,396
Not too close, they've
 gotta have run to function.

669
00:43:51,396 --> 00:43:54,766
13 years is a long dry spell.

670
00:43:54,766 --> 00:43:58,770
Oh the nights I dreamed of
 having a beautiful woman.

671
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:02,607
And now I got two in one blow.

672
00:44:02,607 --> 00:44:06,077
I got one for the main
 dish, and one for dessert.

673
00:44:08,814 --> 00:44:11,883
Problem is, which to have first?

674
00:44:11,883 --> 00:44:13,819
Yeah.

675
00:44:13,819 --> 00:44:17,723
(upbeat music)

676
00:44:20,759 --> 00:44:23,862
Let's try the chick-a-dee.

677
00:44:23,862 --> 00:44:25,697
Yeah.

678
00:44:25,697 --> 00:44:29,500
(upbeat music)

679
00:44:31,336 --> 00:44:32,871
I thought I warned you.

680
00:44:32,871 --> 00:44:34,439
Didn't I?

681
00:44:34,439 --> 00:44:36,808
You don't know how
close to death you are.

682
00:44:36,808 --> 00:44:41,546
(upbeat music)

683
00:44:41,546 --> 00:44:43,882
Listen, you brat, you
 come at me once more

684
00:44:43,882 --> 00:44:45,550
and I'll blast you.

685
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:48,153
Now why don't you
 sit back and relax.

686
00:44:48,153 --> 00:44:51,990
Ol' Pascal's going to treat
 you to a passion play.

687
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:54,726
(laughing)

688
00:44:54,726 --> 00:44:58,229
(upbeat music)

689
00:45:13,678 --> 00:45:15,814
- You dirty bastard.

690
00:45:15,814 --> 00:45:18,716
(upbeat music)

691
00:45:51,516 --> 00:45:54,685
(crying)

692
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:58,123
(laughing)

693
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:01,692
- You enjoyed the
 passion play, didn't you?

694
00:46:01,692 --> 00:46:03,929
We'll have to give you
 a repeat peformance.

695
00:46:03,929 --> 00:46:05,964
The supporting
 actress has loved it.

696
00:46:05,964 --> 00:46:09,400
Come on, you loved
 it, tell the brat.

697
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,802
She loved it.

698
00:46:10,802 --> 00:46:12,270
It's good for you,
 keeps you in shape.

699
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:14,940
(laughing)

700
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:23,048
Whip me up a souffle,
 half a dozen eggs,

701
00:46:23,048 --> 00:46:26,617
rest of us are going
 out for some exercise.

702
00:46:28,954 --> 00:46:32,157
Come on, let's go.

703
00:46:33,491 --> 00:46:35,693
Move.

704
00:46:49,674 --> 00:46:51,776
Come on, you too.

705
00:46:53,244 --> 00:46:56,948
(dramatic music)

706
00:46:59,784 --> 00:47:03,321
Dammit, he can't have
 just disappeared.

707
00:47:07,025 --> 00:47:08,559
Gotta be here somewhere.

708
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:11,229
Damn it to hell, I'm not crazy.

709
00:47:12,563 --> 00:47:15,233
You'll find that
 body, and by tonight.

710
00:47:15,233 --> 00:47:16,367
That's if you know
 what's good for you,

711
00:47:16,367 --> 00:47:17,835
you understand me, brat?

712
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:19,404
Go on, dig!

713
00:47:19,404 --> 00:47:22,840
(dramatic music)

714
00:47:24,242 --> 00:47:25,977
Ah, here comes my breakfast.

715
00:47:25,977 --> 00:47:29,180
(dramatic music)

716
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:32,117
(bird calls)

717
00:47:32,117 --> 00:47:33,684
Care to join me,
 chick-a-dee, you had a

718
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:35,253
real workout last night.

719
00:47:35,253 --> 00:47:36,654
(laughing)

720
00:47:36,654 --> 00:47:37,855
You gotta keep your strength up.

721
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:40,358
(laughing)

722
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:41,859
For next time.

723
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:43,861
(laughing)

724
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:46,297
You use six eggs?

725
00:47:46,297 --> 00:47:48,299
Huh?

726
00:47:48,299 --> 00:47:50,969
Yeah I guess that's big enough.

727
00:47:53,838 --> 00:47:55,640
Hmm.

728
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:57,976
You try it first.

729
00:48:03,414 --> 00:48:05,016
Is it good?

730
00:48:05,016 --> 00:48:07,252
(laughing)

731
00:48:08,786 --> 00:48:11,722
Lovely, fit for a king.

732
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:23,101
Say ah.

733
00:48:23,101 --> 00:48:24,369
(laughing)

734
00:48:24,369 --> 00:48:26,471
What's the matter,
don't you like bananas?

735
00:48:26,471 --> 00:48:27,872
(laughing)

736
00:48:27,872 --> 00:48:31,309
(dramatic music)

737
00:48:41,552 --> 00:48:44,155
- $200,000, huh?

738
00:48:44,155 --> 00:48:45,123
Now where on earth
 am I going to get

739
00:48:45,123 --> 00:48:47,825
that kind of money?

740
00:49:07,578 --> 00:49:10,515
(laughing)

741
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:14,352
- I'll take this off
your hands for a start.

742
00:49:14,352 --> 00:49:17,455
Should be worth a
 couple of thousand.

743
00:49:20,125 --> 00:49:21,492
Now let's see.

744
00:49:21,492 --> 00:49:24,862
(dramatic music)

745
00:49:27,165 --> 00:49:29,300
What's this rat hole used for?

746
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:30,501
- [Falesse] Rats.

747
00:49:30,501 --> 00:49:32,670
- [Pascal] Oh.

748
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:34,472
(dramatic music)

749
00:49:34,472 --> 00:49:36,274
Hmm.

750
00:49:36,274 --> 00:49:38,643
And what have we here?

751
00:49:38,643 --> 00:49:40,145
Well.

752
00:49:40,145 --> 00:49:41,646
- [Falesse] The whole estate
 is an archaeological site.

753
00:49:41,646 --> 00:49:43,381
These are the remains of
 the Etruscan civilization.

754
00:49:43,381 --> 00:49:44,615
- Oh yeah?

755
00:49:44,615 --> 00:49:45,850
You think we can maybe
 include the remains

756
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:48,619
of your father?

757
00:49:48,619 --> 00:49:51,422
- Those bones are
 2,000 years old.

758
00:49:51,422 --> 00:49:52,757
You can see that.

759
00:49:52,757 --> 00:49:54,459
- Oh, I wasn't around then.

760
00:49:54,459 --> 00:49:56,627
- And besides, no killer
would be about to place

761
00:49:56,627 --> 00:49:59,030
his own victim on
 display like this.

762
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:02,600
- I wouldn't be surprised.

763
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,369
Hey, what's this?

764
00:50:04,369 --> 00:50:06,504
- I'd call it the kiss
 of death, for you.

765
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:08,873
- [Pascal] Huh?

766
00:50:08,873 --> 00:50:11,442
- [Colin] We do the
 washing in here.

767
00:50:11,442 --> 00:50:14,212
And it's rather obvious
 washing isn't your cup of tea.

768
00:50:14,212 --> 00:50:15,380
(laughing)

769
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:16,814
- Yeah, that's very good.

770
00:50:16,814 --> 00:50:18,549
Kiss of death.

771
00:50:18,549 --> 00:50:21,552
Yeah well water isn't
 good for you but

772
00:50:21,552 --> 00:50:24,922
I'd sort of like to get
 the stink of jail off me.

773
00:50:24,922 --> 00:50:26,691
I believe I'll take the risk.

774
00:50:26,691 --> 00:50:29,760
Brat, fix me a bath.

775
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,529
- Yes, sir.

776
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:33,931
With pleasure, sir.

777
00:50:33,931 --> 00:50:37,835
- No, no, you jerk, not
here in the outhouse.

778
00:50:37,835 --> 00:50:40,505
Upstairs, chick-a-dee's
bathtub, with lots of

779
00:50:40,505 --> 00:50:43,308
bath oil and a sponge,
 you understand?

780
00:50:43,308 --> 00:50:44,975
- No I don't understand.

781
00:50:44,975 --> 00:50:46,944
Go ahead, run to the
police with your story.

782
00:50:46,944 --> 00:50:48,413
If they come looking, who knows?

783
00:50:48,413 --> 00:50:50,415
The body they find
 might just be yours.

784
00:50:50,415 --> 00:50:51,449
- [Pascal] You think so?

785
00:50:51,449 --> 00:50:52,417
Then say it again.

786
00:50:52,417 --> 00:50:53,718
Say it again.

787
00:50:53,718 --> 00:50:55,220
You want to change your mind?

788
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:57,855
Then move.

789
00:50:59,757 --> 00:51:02,293
You're lucky, brat.

790
00:51:04,995 --> 00:51:07,064
(door closes)

791
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:10,368
(coo-coo clock chimes)

792
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:22,079
(door opens and closes)

793
00:51:23,314 --> 00:51:26,083
- [Lucille] You mustn't
provoke him, Colin.

794
00:51:29,454 --> 00:51:31,389
- Look, I've had it.

795
00:51:31,389 --> 00:51:33,824
He has to go.

796
00:51:33,824 --> 00:51:36,661
If we could get his gun away.

797
00:51:38,163 --> 00:51:40,998
- [Lucille] Cyanide,
you should see it work.

798
00:51:40,998 --> 00:51:44,169
It did quite a thorough job,
 first time I watched it.

799
00:51:44,169 --> 00:51:47,938
(dramatic music)

800
00:51:52,877 --> 00:51:55,546
When the Germans told us we
 were going to take a shower

801
00:51:55,546 --> 00:51:58,483
that meant it was the end.

802
00:51:58,483 --> 00:52:01,552
The shower was a gas chamber.

803
00:52:01,552 --> 00:52:04,255
My mother, my
 sisters, my friends,

804
00:52:04,255 --> 00:52:06,191
they were all gassed.

805
00:52:06,191 --> 00:52:07,992
But as for me--

806
00:52:07,992 --> 00:52:11,329
(dramatic music)

807
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:14,031
- Not you.

808
00:52:14,031 --> 00:52:16,234
- Go on, keep moving.

809
00:52:16,234 --> 00:52:18,002
- She can have a
 shower next time.

810
00:52:18,002 --> 00:52:19,670
- Sure, why not?

811
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:23,274
Sooner or later.

812
00:52:23,274 --> 00:52:24,542
- No, let me go.

813
00:52:24,542 --> 00:52:25,510
- You should be grateful.

814
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:28,846
- I want to die with the others.

815
00:52:28,846 --> 00:52:30,748
Mother.

816
00:52:30,748 --> 00:52:32,082
Mamma.

817
00:52:32,082 --> 00:52:34,452
(crying)

818
00:52:34,452 --> 00:52:37,388
I couldn't hear them but
I could see everything

819
00:52:37,388 --> 00:52:40,157
through the windows, how
they cried and choked

820
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:42,660
as the gas enveloped them.

821
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:44,295
Took only a moment.

822
00:52:44,295 --> 00:52:45,696
(crying)

823
00:52:45,696 --> 00:52:47,398
Let me die with my mamma.

824
00:52:47,398 --> 00:52:49,234
(crying)

825
00:52:49,234 --> 00:52:52,002
(dramatic music)

826
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:53,504
- [Man3] Don't worry,
 you'll get your turn too,

827
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:54,905
sooner or later.

828
00:52:54,905 --> 00:52:56,607
(laughing)

829
00:52:56,607 --> 00:52:59,043
(crying)

830
00:52:59,043 --> 00:53:00,911
(dramatic music)

831
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:03,113
- It's the matter of a second.

832
00:53:05,716 --> 00:53:07,685
There's not even time to react.

833
00:53:07,685 --> 00:53:08,986
- [Pascal] Ah.

834
00:53:08,986 --> 00:53:12,056
(laughing)

835
00:53:12,056 --> 00:53:13,958
Oh.

836
00:53:13,958 --> 00:53:15,793
(laughing)

837
00:53:15,793 --> 00:53:17,094
Ooh.

838
00:53:17,094 --> 00:53:19,297
(laughing)

839
00:53:19,297 --> 00:53:21,131
Oh.

840
00:53:21,131 --> 00:53:24,269
(upbeat music)

841
00:53:24,269 --> 00:53:25,202
(laughing)

842
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:26,170
Oh boy.

843
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:28,172
(laughing)

844
00:53:28,172 --> 00:53:31,676
(upbeat music)

845
00:53:33,678 --> 00:53:36,481
(dramatic music)

846
00:53:37,615 --> 00:53:39,950
Ah.

847
00:53:41,819 --> 00:53:44,655
- Don't.

848
00:53:44,655 --> 00:53:46,857
Let me go.

849
00:53:46,857 --> 00:53:50,595
(crying)

850
00:53:50,595 --> 00:53:54,532
- Oh yeah, oh, oh yeah.

851
00:53:54,532 --> 00:53:55,700
Yeah.

852
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:57,234
Oh.

853
00:53:57,234 --> 00:54:00,137
(dramatic music)

854
00:54:00,137 --> 00:54:01,706
(laughing)

855
00:54:01,706 --> 00:54:05,109
(dramatic music)

856
00:54:28,866 --> 00:54:31,669
(gasping)

857
00:54:41,211 --> 00:54:44,615
(laughing)

858
00:54:52,557 --> 00:54:56,226
(dramatic music)

859
00:55:09,407 --> 00:55:10,608
- You can relax now,
 I think our guest's

860
00:55:10,608 --> 00:55:12,276
grown bored with it all.

861
00:55:12,276 --> 00:55:14,512
Come on upstairs,
 you'll be amused.

862
00:55:14,512 --> 00:55:16,180
(dramatic music)

863
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:17,448
There's nothing to fear.

864
00:55:17,448 --> 00:55:19,283
- What are you doing
 with that gas mask?

865
00:55:19,283 --> 00:55:20,585
- [Colin] I was
 playing World War I.

866
00:55:20,585 --> 00:55:21,486
Over the top.

867
00:55:21,486 --> 00:55:22,520
(laughing)

868
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:24,221
Come on, kid.

869
00:55:30,928 --> 00:55:32,730
(dramatic music)

870
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:34,231
(screaming)

871
00:55:34,231 --> 00:55:36,667
- Colin, who killed him?

872
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:38,002
Did you kill him?

873
00:55:38,002 --> 00:55:41,305
- Oh no, the soap duds
 didn't agree with him.

874
00:55:45,910 --> 00:55:48,145
- You knew I liked him.

875
00:55:48,145 --> 00:55:49,614
Yet you killed him.

876
00:55:49,614 --> 00:55:51,882
You killed him because
 you were jealous.

877
00:55:51,882 --> 00:55:54,685
Because he's a real man
and you're only a worm.

878
00:55:55,786 --> 00:55:57,755
A rotten worm.

879
00:55:57,755 --> 00:55:59,790
- Thanks a lot, our only
 other choices were getting

880
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:01,025
killed or going to jail.

881
00:56:01,025 --> 00:56:03,293
Are you aware of that?

882
00:56:03,293 --> 00:56:05,663
- Why jail?

883
00:56:05,663 --> 00:56:07,264
You like to kill?

884
00:56:07,264 --> 00:56:08,365
You're a sadist.

885
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:09,366
- Yes, like you.

886
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:10,300
- Sadist!

887
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:11,135
- [Colin] Go on, beat me.

888
00:56:11,135 --> 00:56:11,936
- I will.

889
00:56:11,936 --> 00:56:13,070
- I'm yours.

890
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:14,605
- Yes, you're
 nothing but my slave.

891
00:56:14,605 --> 00:56:15,706
Slave!

892
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:16,807
On your knees.

893
00:56:16,807 --> 00:56:17,675
(laughing)

894
00:56:17,675 --> 00:56:18,476
- [Colin] Beat me.

895
00:56:18,476 --> 00:56:19,477
Yes.

896
00:56:19,477 --> 00:56:21,178
- Yes.

897
00:56:21,178 --> 00:56:22,580
My slave.

898
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:26,216
- Yes, yours.

899
00:56:28,619 --> 00:56:30,421
- Stop it, Colin.

900
00:56:30,421 --> 00:56:32,356
Colin.

901
00:56:32,356 --> 00:56:33,558
Go on.

902
00:56:33,558 --> 00:56:34,759
No more.

903
00:56:34,759 --> 00:56:36,093
You too, Falesse.

904
00:56:36,093 --> 00:56:38,863
We've got trouble
 enough already.

905
00:56:41,165 --> 00:56:42,700
- Well now what
 are we going to do?

906
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:44,935
We can't leave him here.

907
00:56:44,935 --> 00:56:46,937
- We'll do him like the others.

908
00:56:46,937 --> 00:56:48,205
Don't you know?

909
00:56:48,205 --> 00:56:50,641
Hmm, praying mantis?

910
00:56:50,641 --> 00:56:53,978
You have a little fun and
 then all of the sudden

911
00:56:53,978 --> 00:56:56,614
they all wind up dead.

912
00:56:56,614 --> 00:56:59,717
It's a regular ritual.

913
00:56:59,717 --> 00:57:03,454
You create the problem and
 our job is the final solution.

914
00:57:03,454 --> 00:57:06,423
We're experts at it.

915
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:09,059
Like to help us out?

916
00:57:09,059 --> 00:57:11,295
- No.

917
00:57:12,196 --> 00:57:15,566
(dramatic music)

918
00:58:07,351 --> 00:58:09,286
(laughing)

919
00:58:09,286 --> 00:58:12,923
(dramatic music)

920
00:58:21,832 --> 00:58:24,702
- Papa, no!

921
00:58:26,136 --> 00:58:27,572
(laughing)

922
00:58:27,572 --> 00:58:29,173
- [Colin] Pascal, can't you see?

923
00:58:29,173 --> 00:58:31,241
(laughing)

924
00:58:31,241 --> 00:58:34,945
(dramatic music)

925
00:58:58,202 --> 00:59:01,606
(serene music)

926
00:59:09,446 --> 00:59:12,216
(bird calls)

927
00:59:12,216 --> 00:59:15,820
(serene music)

928
00:59:33,337 --> 00:59:37,341
(bird calls)

929
00:59:37,341 --> 00:59:41,946
(dramatic music)

930
00:59:41,946 --> 00:59:43,347
- Lucille.

931
00:59:43,347 --> 00:59:46,651
(dramatic music)

932
00:59:46,651 --> 00:59:47,885
(laughing)

933
00:59:47,885 --> 00:59:49,519
It's me, Andre.

934
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:51,822
(dramatic music)

935
00:59:51,822 --> 00:59:54,892
- Mr. A, that's not possible.

936
00:59:54,892 --> 00:59:56,260
- Really?

937
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:57,662
It's true, I'm not a ghost.

938
00:59:57,662 --> 00:59:58,996
- You're not the same man.

939
00:59:58,996 --> 01:00:02,700
- I only look different
because of surgery.

940
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:05,202
There.

941
01:00:05,202 --> 01:00:07,404
Very little left
 of the old Andre.

942
01:00:07,404 --> 01:00:09,640
You could say, as
 everyone thinks,

943
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:13,010
that he did die years
 ago, out there somewhere.

944
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:16,513
- Your eyes are his eyes.

945
01:00:16,513 --> 01:00:18,548
- I've aged but nonetheless.

946
01:00:18,548 --> 01:00:21,418
(dramatic music)

947
01:00:21,418 --> 01:00:23,420
- Welcome to your old house.

948
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:26,290
(dramatic music)

949
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:29,660
- What an idea, having
 me end up lost at sea.

950
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:31,528
It was very clever thinking.

951
01:00:31,528 --> 01:00:34,198
- I thought it was best
 after that horrible night.

952
01:00:34,198 --> 01:00:36,500
- The boys were all
 convinced by it too.

953
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:39,804
It was pleasant, you know,
 to suddenly feel free.

954
01:00:39,804 --> 01:00:41,505
- Yes, no one ever suspected.

955
01:00:41,505 --> 01:00:43,373
When the priest was giving
 the last rites down by

956
01:00:43,373 --> 01:00:46,210
the pier, I began to cry,
 along with the children.

957
01:00:46,210 --> 01:00:47,778
Even I was convinced
 for a moment.

958
01:00:47,778 --> 01:00:48,846
(laughing)

959
01:00:48,846 --> 01:00:51,248
(bird calls)

960
01:00:51,248 --> 01:00:54,018
- Kiki, old pal.

961
01:00:54,018 --> 01:00:55,920
You'd know me, no
matter what I look like.

962
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:57,554
(laughing)

963
01:00:57,554 --> 01:01:00,657
(dramatic music)

964
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:02,727
- You hear, another
 one for the birds.

965
01:01:02,727 --> 01:01:04,194
(dramatic music)

966
01:01:04,194 --> 01:01:05,730
- And Kioka?

967
01:01:05,730 --> 01:01:09,033
- He died last year, old age.

968
01:01:09,033 --> 01:01:11,135
Tell me, why didn't you ever
 let me know where you were.

969
01:01:11,135 --> 01:01:12,636
- I couldn't take the risk.

970
01:01:12,636 --> 01:01:15,472
The police or worse the
 gang might have found out.

971
01:01:15,472 --> 01:01:17,041
Now that 13 years have passed,

972
01:01:17,041 --> 01:01:18,342
they've forgotten me.

973
01:01:18,342 --> 01:01:21,779
And with a face lift,
 I'm in the clear.

974
01:01:21,779 --> 01:01:23,480
Now my name is Derek Steele.

975
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:24,581
(laughing)

976
01:01:24,581 --> 01:01:25,916
Mr. D.

977
01:01:25,916 --> 01:01:27,417
Not wanting to stretch
 my luck though,

978
01:01:27,417 --> 01:01:29,486
I sent somebody ahead of me.

979
01:01:29,486 --> 01:01:31,956
Michel gave me the green
light to come down.

980
01:01:31,956 --> 01:01:33,357
So here I am.

981
01:01:33,357 --> 01:01:34,992
- Well I'm delighted.

982
01:01:34,992 --> 01:01:36,693
Oh what a lovely day.

983
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:38,996
I always knew you'd
come back to your home.

984
01:01:38,996 --> 01:01:41,598
- I never once
 doubted your loyalty.

985
01:01:41,598 --> 01:01:45,502
And Falesse, what's
 she like now, Lucille?

986
01:01:46,904 --> 01:01:49,406
- I'll call her, she's upstairs.

987
01:01:49,406 --> 01:01:52,476
Falesse, Falesse, Falesse.

988
01:01:54,244 --> 01:01:56,046
She's no longer a little girl.

989
01:01:56,046 --> 01:01:57,848
You have a lady for a daughter.

990
01:01:57,848 --> 01:02:00,017
As pretty as can be.

991
01:02:00,017 --> 01:02:02,519
I'll lead the way.

992
01:02:03,387 --> 01:02:04,855
- [Andre] Thank you, Lucille.

993
01:02:04,855 --> 01:02:06,924
- Colin, you'll never
 guess who's here.

994
01:02:06,924 --> 01:02:08,558
You don't recognize
 my son, do you?

995
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:10,795
He's all grown up.

996
01:02:10,795 --> 01:02:12,129
This is Andre.

997
01:02:12,129 --> 01:02:13,330
- How do you do?

998
01:02:13,330 --> 01:02:14,765
- Well amazing.

999
01:02:14,765 --> 01:02:16,801
You are a big man.

1000
01:02:16,801 --> 01:02:20,504
Back then I thought
 he was a born midget.

1001
01:02:20,504 --> 01:02:23,707
- Falesse.

1002
01:02:23,707 --> 01:02:25,342
(door closes)

1003
01:02:25,342 --> 01:02:26,977
Falesse.

1004
01:02:26,977 --> 01:02:28,212
Your father.

1005
01:02:28,212 --> 01:02:31,248
(serene music)

1006
01:02:34,852 --> 01:02:36,720
- [Andre] My child.

1007
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:40,257
(serene music)

1008
01:02:43,393 --> 01:02:45,262
- No.

1009
01:02:45,262 --> 01:02:47,597
(serene music)

1010
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:49,099
- I'm your father.

1011
01:02:49,099 --> 01:02:51,735
Oh, Falesse, how
I've missed you.

1012
01:02:51,735 --> 01:02:52,669
- No.

1013
01:02:52,669 --> 01:02:54,438
It's impossible.

1014
01:02:54,438 --> 01:02:55,739
My father's dead.

1015
01:02:55,739 --> 01:02:57,741
- What makes you think
 that, Falesse, dear?

1016
01:02:57,741 --> 01:02:59,143
- [Falesse] It's true, he died.

1017
01:02:59,143 --> 01:03:00,878
It was 13 years ago.

1018
01:03:00,878 --> 01:03:02,746
He's dead, I killed him.

1019
01:03:02,746 --> 01:03:03,647
- No you didn't.

1020
01:03:03,647 --> 01:03:04,448
- I did.

1021
01:03:04,448 --> 01:03:05,649
- What is this?

1022
01:03:05,649 --> 01:03:07,117
It's me, Falesse.

1023
01:03:07,117 --> 01:03:08,986
I'm alive and well.

1024
01:03:08,986 --> 01:03:11,621
- No.

1025
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:13,190
No.

1026
01:03:13,190 --> 01:03:15,292
My father's dead.

1027
01:03:15,292 --> 01:03:17,061
I didn't want to.

1028
01:03:17,061 --> 01:03:18,562
I didn't want to.

1029
01:03:18,562 --> 01:03:20,998
But I killed him, he's dead!

1030
01:03:20,998 --> 01:03:23,800
(dramatic music)

1031
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,269
- Just who the hell are you?

1032
01:03:25,269 --> 01:03:27,337
Why don't you get out of
 here, mind your own business.

1033
01:03:27,337 --> 01:03:30,274
- [Lucille] Colin, come
back here and apologize.

1034
01:03:30,274 --> 01:03:32,977
- [Andre] Never mind,
 what's going on here?

1035
01:03:32,977 --> 01:03:35,045
I want an explanation.

1036
01:03:35,045 --> 01:03:38,215
(serene music)

1037
01:03:42,887 --> 01:03:47,591
- The night the killer
came here to the house.

1038
01:03:47,591 --> 01:03:51,061
I suppose his orders
were simply to kill you.

1039
01:03:51,061 --> 01:03:53,830
(gunshots)

1040
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:13,417
But when you got away,
 and he realized he'd

1041
01:04:13,417 --> 01:04:16,720
bungled the job, he decided
 to take it out on me.

1042
01:04:20,891 --> 01:04:23,928
Then Falesse arrived, the
 shots had woken her up.

1043
01:04:23,928 --> 01:04:27,131
- Papa, Papa, what
 are you doing, Papa?

1044
01:04:27,131 --> 01:04:29,666
- [Lucille] The
 brute attacked her.

1045
01:04:29,666 --> 01:04:30,901
- No, no.

1046
01:04:30,901 --> 01:04:32,402
- [Lucille] Since it was
in her father's room,

1047
01:04:32,402 --> 01:04:35,940
she mistook him for you.

1048
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:38,642
- [Falesse] You're hurting me.

1049
01:04:38,642 --> 01:04:41,345
(moaning)

1050
01:04:41,345 --> 01:04:44,514
- [Lucille] The child was raped.

1051
01:04:44,514 --> 01:04:47,051
After, when I
 managed to free her,

1052
01:04:47,051 --> 01:04:48,485
she grabbed one of those swords

1053
01:04:48,485 --> 01:04:50,120
hanging in your room.

1054
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:53,657
(dramatic music)

1055
01:04:53,657 --> 01:04:54,925
And she killed him.

1056
01:04:54,925 --> 01:04:56,860
(screaming)

1057
01:04:56,860 --> 01:05:00,197
(dramatic music)

1058
01:05:02,132 --> 01:05:03,733
From that moment on, she
believed she had killed

1059
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:07,337
her father.

1060
01:05:07,337 --> 01:05:09,739
I tried to get the
 truth through to her.

1061
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:11,175
She had a nervous
 breakdown because I worked

1062
01:05:11,175 --> 01:05:13,777
so hard at it.

1063
01:05:13,777 --> 01:05:17,547
The best thing the doctors
 tell me is to leave it alone.

1064
01:05:17,547 --> 01:05:21,451
In all other
 respects, she's okay.

1065
01:05:22,619 --> 01:05:26,123
I did everything
 possible for her.

1066
01:05:34,398 --> 01:05:37,467
I'm sorry, Andre,
 but it's the truth.

1067
01:05:37,467 --> 01:05:40,170
- Such a horrible story.

1068
01:05:40,170 --> 01:05:42,806
(clock ticking)

1069
01:05:42,806 --> 01:05:46,610
(dramatic music)

1070
01:06:15,905 --> 01:06:17,074
- Yeah, I thought so.

1071
01:06:17,074 --> 01:06:18,308
You're not Mr. A.

1072
01:06:18,308 --> 01:06:20,810
He wouldn't try to
 make his own daughter.

1073
01:06:22,312 --> 01:06:25,615
Get out of here, you
 lecherous old bastard.

1074
01:06:25,615 --> 01:06:26,850
- Leave him alone, what
business is it of yours?

1075
01:06:28,652 --> 01:06:30,720
- So you'd take on
 your own father, eh?

1076
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:32,456
You're disgusting.

1077
01:06:32,456 --> 01:06:34,958
Slut!

1078
01:06:34,958 --> 01:06:37,227
- Now listen, young man,
tell me just one thing.

1079
01:06:37,227 --> 01:06:40,030
Where's your sister,
 Lucille's daughter Ester?

1080
01:06:40,030 --> 01:06:42,666
Where is she?

1081
01:06:42,666 --> 01:06:46,136
- I don't get it, I mean
she's, well she's dead.

1082
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:50,107
Tell him, Lucille.

1083
01:06:50,107 --> 01:06:53,243
- It's all right.

1084
01:06:53,243 --> 01:06:56,746
He was very attached to Ester.

1085
01:06:56,746 --> 01:06:58,848
- What happened to her?

1086
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:02,018
- Four months after
 you disapppeared.

1087
01:07:04,454 --> 01:07:06,256
While out riding her bicycle.

1088
01:07:06,256 --> 01:07:07,691
She was hit by a car.

1089
01:07:07,691 --> 01:07:11,228
(dramatic music)

1090
01:07:11,228 --> 01:07:14,331
The driver came around
 too close to the curb.

1091
01:07:14,331 --> 01:07:15,932
She died instantly.

1092
01:07:15,932 --> 01:07:17,901
Right in front of my eyes.

1093
01:07:17,901 --> 01:07:20,003
(dramatic music)

1094
01:07:20,003 --> 01:07:21,938
I didn't want to stay on here.

1095
01:07:21,938 --> 01:07:24,774
But it was possible that
 one day you might return.

1096
01:07:24,774 --> 01:07:27,111
- [Andre] You buried her in
 the local cemetery, I suppose.

1097
01:07:29,179 --> 01:07:30,480
- Yes.

1098
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:34,118
Yes we did.

1099
01:07:36,286 --> 01:07:39,389
We take flowers to
 the grave regularly.

1100
01:07:39,389 --> 01:07:41,425
- Let's go there this afternoon.

1101
01:07:41,425 --> 01:07:44,261
(clock ticking)

1102
01:07:44,261 --> 01:07:45,329
(laughing)

1103
01:07:45,329 --> 01:07:48,098
- You needn't bother.

1104
01:07:48,098 --> 01:07:52,202
- I will though.

1105
01:07:52,202 --> 01:07:53,670
I want to see her.

1106
01:07:53,670 --> 01:07:57,607
(dramatic music)

1107
01:08:29,406 --> 01:08:32,842
- Ester. Radiguet, tomb 213.

1108
01:08:34,144 --> 01:08:36,280
Authorization of the
 tomb and place bones

1109
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:38,982
in the common channel,
 now sign here.

1110
01:08:38,982 --> 01:08:40,650
- There's the mother.

1111
01:08:40,650 --> 01:08:44,154
(dramatic music)

1112
01:09:36,906 --> 01:09:40,510
This is Michel's car, isn't it?

1113
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:44,013
What happened to
him, by the way?

1114
01:09:45,315 --> 01:09:48,051
- A couple days
 ago, he took off.

1115
01:09:48,051 --> 01:09:49,419
Him and the other guy.

1116
01:09:49,419 --> 01:09:50,687
Look, but they'll be back.

1117
01:09:50,687 --> 01:09:51,888
- I hope so.

1118
01:09:51,888 --> 01:09:55,091
(dramatic music)

1119
01:10:04,901 --> 01:10:08,204
- It was terrible of you to
 subject her to that today.

1120
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:11,308
She's a very troubled person.

1121
01:10:11,308 --> 01:10:13,643
- [Andre] She suffered
 nobly I thought.

1122
01:10:13,643 --> 01:10:16,446
- [Lucille] Didn't you believe
 that Ester was really dead?

1123
01:10:16,446 --> 01:10:17,681
(laughing)

1124
01:10:17,681 --> 01:10:20,183
- And now I believe
 it even less.

1125
01:10:20,183 --> 01:10:22,786
The family album, tombstone.

1126
01:10:22,786 --> 01:10:24,388
(laughing)

1127
01:10:24,388 --> 01:10:26,823
Fake mole and a wig.

1128
01:10:26,823 --> 01:10:29,759
A cemetery registered
 altered for a fee and then

1129
01:10:29,759 --> 01:10:31,828
the whole thing's done.

1130
01:10:31,828 --> 01:10:33,997
Who would ever
 think of checking?

1131
01:10:33,997 --> 01:10:36,533
Perfect caper.

1132
01:10:36,533 --> 01:10:39,503
- What are you
 inferring by all this?

1133
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:45,909
- I'm afraid you're going
 to have to come clean.

1134
01:10:45,909 --> 01:10:47,477
- [Lucille] Any suggestions?

1135
01:10:47,477 --> 01:10:51,180
- For a start, where's
 my daughter Falesse?

1136
01:10:53,116 --> 01:10:54,584
That's just a warning.

1137
01:10:54,584 --> 01:10:56,853
Come on now, Lucille.

1138
01:10:56,853 --> 01:10:58,187
Where's Falesse?

1139
01:10:58,187 --> 01:10:59,689
What have you done with her?

1140
01:10:59,689 --> 01:11:02,659
Why this masquerade?

1141
01:11:05,228 --> 01:11:07,030
Where's my daughter?

1142
01:11:07,030 --> 01:11:09,999
Answer me.

1143
01:11:09,999 --> 01:11:12,168
- She went insane.

1144
01:11:12,168 --> 01:11:13,803
When she killed that man.

1145
01:11:13,803 --> 01:11:15,639
(upbeat music)

1146
01:11:15,639 --> 01:11:18,475
(laughing)

1147
01:11:19,409 --> 01:11:21,411
- You committed her then?

1148
01:11:21,411 --> 01:11:24,714
(laughing)

1149
01:11:26,750 --> 01:11:29,753
- I gave Falesse every ounce
 of help I could muster.

1150
01:11:29,753 --> 01:11:33,122
- How is she?

1151
01:11:34,257 --> 01:11:36,593
- Completely incurable,
so the doctors say.

1152
01:11:36,593 --> 01:11:38,362
- Have her brought here.

1153
01:11:38,362 --> 01:11:40,864
- Impossible now.

1154
01:11:40,864 --> 01:11:43,600
I'd be glad to go with you
 if you'd like to see her.

1155
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,569
- Impossible?

1156
01:11:45,569 --> 01:11:46,836
I disagree.

1157
01:11:46,836 --> 01:11:48,104
She's got to come here.

1158
01:11:48,104 --> 01:11:49,305
- Why?

1159
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:50,374
- To settle this.

1160
01:11:50,374 --> 01:11:51,307
- No.

1161
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:52,275
- Yes.

1162
01:11:52,275 --> 01:11:53,977
Plus she's the rightful owner.

1163
01:11:53,977 --> 01:11:56,179
(dramatic music)

1164
01:11:56,179 --> 01:11:58,214
This is her villa.

1165
01:11:58,214 --> 01:12:00,016
(dramatic music)

1166
01:12:00,016 --> 01:12:01,184
- No.

1167
01:12:01,184 --> 01:12:02,386
- Why not?

1168
01:12:02,386 --> 01:12:05,622
- It's the wrong way.

1169
01:12:10,259 --> 01:12:13,162
It's much too
 noisy, it's vulgar.

1170
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:16,600
That's not my style.

1171
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:19,268
It's got to be clever.

1172
01:12:19,268 --> 01:12:21,771
With a touch of artistry.

1173
01:12:21,771 --> 01:12:24,974
Look I guarantee this
 evening, we'll be free of him.

1174
01:12:46,229 --> 01:12:49,433
(bird calls)

1175
01:12:57,173 --> 01:13:00,610
(somber music)

1176
01:13:16,726 --> 01:13:19,529
- Falesse, my child.

1177
01:13:19,529 --> 01:13:20,797
- No emotions.

1178
01:13:20,797 --> 01:13:23,399
It's better if I handle her.

1179
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:26,736
Dear, do you know who this is?

1180
01:13:26,736 --> 01:13:28,472
Do you remember?

1181
01:13:28,472 --> 01:13:30,507
He's your father.

1182
01:13:30,507 --> 01:13:33,242
Isn't it wonderful?

1183
01:13:35,879 --> 01:13:39,048
- * La, la, la, la

1184
01:13:42,486 --> 01:13:44,120
- My father sang.

1185
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:46,690
- * La, la, la, la

1186
01:13:46,690 --> 01:13:49,593
- I liked it when Papa sang.

1187
01:14:01,938 --> 01:14:04,273
(gasping)

1188
01:14:06,743 --> 01:14:10,013
I'm very sorry, you see,
no one can touch me.

1189
01:14:16,753 --> 01:14:20,156
Oh the swing.

1190
01:14:21,024 --> 01:14:22,091
Ah.

1191
01:14:22,091 --> 01:14:24,828
Ester, let's swing.

1192
01:14:27,163 --> 01:14:28,131
Can you push us?

1193
01:14:28,131 --> 01:14:29,899
Papa's too busy.

1194
01:14:29,899 --> 01:14:32,301
He never comes and pushes,
 he's always working.

1195
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:35,872
(serene music)

1196
01:15:13,342 --> 01:15:15,779
Antoine.

1197
01:15:15,779 --> 01:15:17,881
He used to push me.

1198
01:15:17,881 --> 01:15:19,348
He's very strong.

1199
01:15:19,348 --> 01:15:22,385
But he was always
 gentle with me.

1200
01:15:22,385 --> 01:15:23,753
He likes my hair.

1201
01:15:23,753 --> 01:15:26,122
He kisses it all the time.

1202
01:15:26,122 --> 01:15:28,592
He says it's made out of gold.

1203
01:15:28,592 --> 01:15:32,328
But the governess doesn't
 like him to touch me.

1204
01:15:34,898 --> 01:15:38,935
There's nobody to caress
my hair any longer.

1205
01:15:38,935 --> 01:15:42,639
Antoine is gone.

1206
01:15:42,639 --> 01:15:43,740
Where did he go?

1207
01:15:43,740 --> 01:15:44,874
- [Lucille] He went away.

1208
01:15:44,874 --> 01:15:46,810
Your father doesn't know where.

1209
01:15:46,810 --> 01:15:49,545
Nobody knows where.

1210
01:15:51,047 --> 01:15:53,282
- Oh.

1211
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:57,787
(bird calls)

1212
01:16:02,425 --> 01:16:04,493
Kiki.

1213
01:16:04,493 --> 01:16:07,030
Kiki.

1214
01:16:07,030 --> 01:16:09,165
Ah.

1215
01:16:09,165 --> 01:16:12,301
Where have you
 been all this time?

1216
01:16:12,301 --> 01:16:13,970
Where's Kioka?

1217
01:16:13,970 --> 01:16:16,039
(laughing)

1218
01:16:16,039 --> 01:16:19,275
(bird calls)

1219
01:16:20,509 --> 01:16:22,245
- I used to play with
 you on the swing.

1220
01:16:22,245 --> 01:16:26,249
(bird calls)

1221
01:16:26,249 --> 01:16:28,785
And Colin.

1222
01:16:28,785 --> 01:16:30,219
You remember, don't you?

1223
01:16:30,219 --> 01:16:32,288
(gasping)

1224
01:16:32,288 --> 01:16:35,692
(dramatic music)

1225
01:16:45,935 --> 01:16:48,772
- * La, la, la, la

1226
01:16:48,772 --> 01:16:53,142
* La, la, la, la, la, la

1227
01:16:53,142 --> 01:16:56,345
* La, la, la, la

1228
01:16:56,345 --> 01:17:00,283
* La, la, la, la, la, la

1229
01:17:01,117 --> 01:17:05,188
(serene music)

1230
01:17:08,725 --> 01:17:12,495
(dramatic music)

1231
01:17:16,199 --> 01:17:17,533
- Come on, Eddie.

1232
01:17:17,533 --> 01:17:19,135
We can be a lot
 rougher, you know?

1233
01:17:19,135 --> 01:17:20,569
So talk.

1234
01:17:20,569 --> 01:17:24,207
(dramatic music)

1235
01:17:25,909 --> 01:17:29,779
- Papa, Papa, where are you?

1236
01:17:32,148 --> 01:17:35,752
(serene music)

1237
01:17:44,293 --> 01:17:46,930
- He's not your father.

1238
01:17:46,930 --> 01:17:50,533
This man's nobody's father.

1239
01:17:50,533 --> 01:17:52,201
Leave him alone.

1240
01:17:52,201 --> 01:17:53,903
Go away.

1241
01:17:53,903 --> 01:17:56,773
Go away, everybody!

1242
01:18:00,009 --> 01:18:03,579
It can't be.

1243
01:18:05,148 --> 01:18:08,251
It can't be.

1244
01:18:09,185 --> 01:18:11,587
Tell them, Lucille.

1245
01:18:11,587 --> 01:18:14,090
Tell them he's not her father.

1246
01:18:14,090 --> 01:18:17,026
Tell them.

1247
01:18:17,026 --> 01:18:20,930
(dramatic music)

1248
01:18:22,498 --> 01:18:24,067
What's the matter?

1249
01:18:24,067 --> 01:18:25,268
Why don't you answer?

1250
01:18:25,268 --> 01:18:27,170
Is she his daughter?

1251
01:18:27,170 --> 01:18:30,606
Well if she's his
 daughter, who am I?

1252
01:18:30,606 --> 01:18:33,142
Who am I?

1253
01:18:33,142 --> 01:18:36,445
- You're Ester.

1254
01:18:36,445 --> 01:18:39,883
Ester, my daughter.

1255
01:18:39,883 --> 01:18:43,853
You're, you're not
 really Falesse.

1256
01:18:43,853 --> 01:18:48,091
(dramatic music)

1257
01:18:51,027 --> 01:18:52,929
(laughing)

1258
01:18:52,929 --> 01:18:56,199
- So, m'lady is really a
 daughter of the governess, eh?

1259
01:18:57,666 --> 01:18:58,701
She's my sister?

1260
01:18:58,701 --> 01:19:00,036
(laughing)

1261
01:19:00,036 --> 01:19:01,304
And I'm her lover.

1262
01:19:01,304 --> 01:19:03,472
(laughing)

1263
01:19:03,472 --> 01:19:06,675
Oh incest, a couple of
children extraordinaire.

1264
01:19:06,675 --> 01:19:09,745
(laughing)

1265
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:13,516
- Why this deceit?

1266
01:19:13,516 --> 01:19:15,251
Why all these lies?

1267
01:19:15,251 --> 01:19:18,021
Why didn't you
 tell me the truth?

1268
01:19:18,021 --> 01:19:19,789
Was it my father?

1269
01:19:19,789 --> 01:19:20,890
I want to know the truth.

1270
01:19:20,890 --> 01:19:22,125
Was it?

1271
01:19:22,125 --> 01:19:24,493
Yes or no?

1272
01:19:24,493 --> 01:19:25,995
Well?

1273
01:19:25,995 --> 01:19:29,132
If it wasn't my father,
 who did I kill that night?

1274
01:19:29,132 --> 01:19:31,767
Who did I kill?

1275
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:34,370
- I don't know, it's
 over and done with.

1276
01:19:34,370 --> 01:19:36,705
It's all in the past.

1277
01:19:36,705 --> 01:19:38,541
I did it for your sake.

1278
01:19:38,541 --> 01:19:42,145
(dramatic music)

1279
01:19:44,047 --> 01:19:46,115
- Just a second.

1280
01:19:46,115 --> 01:19:47,550
Out with the rest of it.

1281
01:19:47,550 --> 01:19:49,185
Everything.

1282
01:19:49,185 --> 01:19:51,487
(dramatic music)

1283
01:19:51,487 --> 01:19:52,989
Or I'll blow my head off.

1284
01:19:52,989 --> 01:19:55,791
- No, no.

1285
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:59,896
Colin, have you
 turned on me too?

1286
01:19:59,896 --> 01:20:02,031
All right, let's finish it.

1287
01:20:02,031 --> 01:20:05,368
(dramatic music)

1288
01:20:18,381 --> 01:20:19,782
- Antoine.

1289
01:20:19,782 --> 01:20:20,850
It was him.

1290
01:20:20,850 --> 01:20:22,385
Now I remember everything.

1291
01:20:22,385 --> 01:20:24,387
He did it, he raped me.

1292
01:20:24,387 --> 01:20:27,690
(gunshots)

1293
01:20:38,467 --> 01:20:40,036
- Failed, huh?

1294
01:20:40,036 --> 01:20:42,671
You said you'd fix it so
he never wake up, huh?

1295
01:20:42,671 --> 01:20:45,208
There's only one thing
 you're any good for.

1296
01:20:45,208 --> 01:20:49,078
(dramatic music)

1297
01:20:51,047 --> 01:20:53,682
- [Falesse] Papa?

1298
01:20:53,682 --> 01:20:55,551
Papa?

1299
01:20:55,551 --> 01:20:58,988
(dramatic music)

1300
01:21:05,228 --> 01:21:07,130
(gasping)

1301
01:21:13,937 --> 01:21:17,273
Papa!

1302
01:21:17,273 --> 01:21:21,010
Help, Lucille.

1303
01:21:21,010 --> 01:21:23,446
Help me, Ester!

1304
01:21:23,446 --> 01:21:25,982
(gasping)

1305
01:21:28,451 --> 01:21:30,753
- Falesse, let her go!

1306
01:21:30,753 --> 01:21:33,822
No, leave her alone.

1307
01:21:33,822 --> 01:21:36,993
No, get off.

1308
01:21:36,993 --> 01:21:38,627
Let her go.

1309
01:21:38,627 --> 01:21:40,964
Leave!

1310
01:21:42,031 --> 01:21:43,266
(screaming)

1311
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:45,201
Let her go.

1312
01:21:45,201 --> 01:21:48,071
Please let her go.

1313
01:21:49,572 --> 01:21:52,375
(moaning)

1314
01:21:55,778 --> 01:21:59,448
(dramatic music)

1315
01:22:20,169 --> 01:22:23,206
(screaming)

1316
01:22:26,775 --> 01:22:29,645
(dramatic music)

1317
01:22:29,645 --> 01:22:33,316
(serene music)

1318
01:22:40,756 --> 01:22:44,360
- Falesse, you've
 come a long way.

1319
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:47,796
But it's all clear
 now, right, dear?

1320
01:22:47,796 --> 01:22:50,599
And there's nothing to
be afraid of, is there?

1321
01:22:50,599 --> 01:22:52,368
- It's all over now, darling.

1322
01:22:52,368 --> 01:22:53,836
And you're back
 where you belong.

1323
01:22:53,836 --> 01:22:55,771
In your own house.

1324
01:22:55,771 --> 01:22:58,741
Forget that night, dear.

1325
01:22:58,741 --> 01:23:02,111
- Then, then I hadn't
 killed anybody.

1326
01:23:07,616 --> 01:23:10,353
And nobody even
 touched me that night.

1327
01:23:10,353 --> 01:23:12,755
Did they?

1328
01:23:12,755 --> 01:23:15,658
- It was always only
 in your mind, Ester.

1329
01:23:15,658 --> 01:23:17,293
- The shock your
 subconscious underwent

1330
01:23:17,293 --> 01:23:20,229
that night caused a
 switch in personality.

1331
01:23:20,229 --> 01:23:21,697
As a result, you
 believed you yourself

1332
01:23:21,697 --> 01:23:24,633
had suffered the
 experiences of your friend.

1333
01:23:24,633 --> 01:23:26,769
Often in this kind of
case, they don't respond

1334
01:23:26,769 --> 01:23:30,106
to treatment, but
 you were very lucky.

1335
01:23:30,106 --> 01:23:32,475
All you need now
 is a little time.

1336
01:23:32,475 --> 01:23:35,978
(serene music)

1337
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,302
- Forgive me, will you?

1338
01:23:59,302 --> 01:24:01,837
I'm sorry I took your place.

1339
01:24:01,837 --> 01:24:04,207
But I hadn't any idea
 I wasn't really you.

1340
01:24:04,207 --> 01:24:08,010
(serene music)

1341
01:24:25,594 --> 01:24:27,996
- [Andre] I'm not through
 with you yet, Lucille.

1342
01:24:27,996 --> 01:24:30,633
You know it's very interesting.

1343
01:24:30,633 --> 01:24:32,335
The night I fled through
 the window, I was thoroughly

1344
01:24:32,335 --> 01:24:35,238
convinced I was a marked man.

1345
01:24:35,238 --> 01:24:38,374
Later it didn't figure
 though, so I began to suspect

1346
01:24:38,374 --> 01:24:40,143
that maybe the boys didn't
 want me out of the way

1347
01:24:40,143 --> 01:24:43,979
at all, all of the sudden
 things started to click.

1348
01:24:46,515 --> 01:24:49,585
No, Antoine just wasn't
the type the gang

1349
01:24:49,585 --> 01:24:51,654
would use to rub someone out.

1350
01:24:51,654 --> 01:24:54,223
He was actually a
 burden to the gang.

1351
01:24:54,223 --> 01:24:56,492
But he was good at one thing.

1352
01:24:56,492 --> 01:24:57,793
You became his
 mistress and that's

1353
01:24:57,793 --> 01:25:00,129
when you started planning.

1354
01:25:00,129 --> 01:25:02,064
Taking him where you
 believed no one would see

1355
01:25:02,064 --> 01:25:04,032
you together.

1356
01:25:04,032 --> 01:25:07,603
(upbeat music)

1357
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:13,609
It was a lonely
 stretch of beach,

1358
01:25:13,609 --> 01:25:15,010
where you could seduce him into

1359
01:25:15,010 --> 01:25:17,413
going along with you.

1360
01:25:17,413 --> 01:25:19,382
But I saw you.

1361
01:25:19,382 --> 01:25:22,818
I watched you spin your
web of sex and death.

1362
01:25:24,220 --> 01:25:27,923
Poor Antoine was too stupid,
 too heated up to resist.

1363
01:25:27,923 --> 01:25:30,993
And willingly agreed to
 go through with your plan.

1364
01:25:30,993 --> 01:25:34,297
(upbeat music)

1365
01:25:38,033 --> 01:25:39,702
It was simple and neat.

1366
01:25:39,702 --> 01:25:42,271
I'm having trouble with the
 gang so why not kill me?

1367
01:25:42,271 --> 01:25:44,039
(gasping)

1368
01:25:44,039 --> 01:25:47,109
Just let it look as if
 the gang had done it.

1369
01:25:47,109 --> 01:25:48,577
You'd be left with
 the villa, the land

1370
01:25:48,577 --> 01:25:51,747
alone's worth a fortune,
you'd be on easy street.

1371
01:25:53,349 --> 01:25:56,719
But you made a mistake,
you killed your lover.

1372
01:25:56,719 --> 01:25:58,287
- I did it for them, the babies.

1373
01:25:58,287 --> 01:25:59,788
- You did, huh?

1374
01:25:59,788 --> 01:26:01,357
Yet you sent Falesse to
 a clinic and brain-washed

1375
01:26:01,357 --> 01:26:02,958
your daughter and even your son.

1376
01:26:02,958 --> 01:26:04,227
- No.

1377
01:26:04,227 --> 01:26:05,428
No.

1378
01:26:05,428 --> 01:26:06,695
- [Andre] Murder
 has to be paid for.

1379
01:26:06,695 --> 01:26:09,398
And it's your turn to pay.

1380
01:26:13,068 --> 01:26:16,772
(dramatic music)

1381
01:27:01,417 --> 01:27:04,920
(laughing)

1382
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:08,257
(dramatic music)

1383
01:27:15,063 --> 01:27:17,500
(lightning strikes)

1384
01:27:17,500 --> 01:27:20,869
(dramatic music)

1385
01:27:31,414 --> 01:27:33,248
- [Colin] Mother.

1386
01:27:33,248 --> 01:27:36,819
(dramatic music)

1387
01:27:48,664 --> 01:27:51,066
- [Ester] Lucille!

1388
01:27:51,066 --> 01:27:54,803
(dramatic music)

1389
01:27:57,072 --> 01:27:58,741
Oh, Mommy.

1390
01:27:58,741 --> 01:28:00,409
Mommy.

1391
01:28:00,409 --> 01:28:02,645
(dramatic music)

1392
01:28:02,645 --> 01:28:05,348
Oh, God, why did she do it?

1393
01:28:05,348 --> 01:28:07,750
(crying)

1394
01:28:07,750 --> 01:28:11,086
(dramatic music)

1395
01:28:11,086 --> 01:28:14,323
(siren sounds)

1396
01:28:16,659 --> 01:28:19,628
(bird calls)

1397
01:28:19,628 --> 01:28:22,931
(siren sounds)

1398
01:28:23,832 --> 01:28:26,034
(bird calls)

1399
01:28:41,149 --> 01:28:42,485
- All over, inspector?

1400
01:28:42,485 --> 01:28:43,852
- [Inspector] All over.

1401
01:28:43,852 --> 01:28:45,287
- What about Alex and Michel?

1402
01:28:45,287 --> 01:28:46,922
Was there any trace of them?

1403
01:28:46,922 --> 01:28:48,691
- They're past history.

1404
01:28:48,691 --> 01:28:51,594
One of the risks of the job.

1405
01:28:51,594 --> 01:28:55,097
The case is closed, sergeant.

1406
01:28:58,701 --> 01:29:01,804
I'm sorry to disillusion
you, Falesse.

1407
01:29:01,804 --> 01:29:04,807
It wasn't very easy playing
 the part of your father

1408
01:29:04,807 --> 01:29:07,209
but I did it for
 your sake, my dear.

1409
01:29:07,209 --> 01:29:09,712
Your father died in
prison three years ago.

1410
01:29:09,712 --> 01:29:12,848
But he asked the police
to look after you.

1411
01:29:16,485 --> 01:29:20,022
(bird calls)

1412
01:29:43,145 --> 01:29:44,780
Now that you're home
 again, you can start

1413
01:29:44,780 --> 01:29:48,183
building yourself a new life,
 and I wish you every success.

1414
01:29:49,985 --> 01:29:51,854
Goodbye, Falesse.

1415
01:29:51,854 --> 01:29:55,390
(dramatic music)
