1
00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:00,041
25.000
Ripped from DVD.

2
00:00:05,588 --> 00:00:08,717
Excuse me a moment.

3
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:12,512
When I get myself together,
I'll come with an answer.

4
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,246
Yo, respect,

5
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:43,126
this is a public service announcement
brought to you

6
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:45,503
by The Great Singin' Cactus.

7
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:52,510
If you are affended by words such as
bitch, ass,

8
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:58,141
dirty slut or even fuck, motherfucker,
tits, pussy,

9
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:04,606
then you should get your goddam fucking
asses out of here right now.

10
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:07,192
This ain't going to be a nice movie.

11
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:11,488
You know,
some people believe

12
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:16,201
there is an absence of some artistic
creativity of something,

13
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:20,288
but you know what?
We do not give a fuck,

14
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:26,294
we like saying shit like this,
just to piss you off...

15
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:31,299
And now, shut the fuck up and put
the goddam fucking movie on...

16
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:38,014
I sad, shut the fuck up and put
the goddam fucking movie on...

17
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:40,350
Are you waiting for christmas or what?

18
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,397
This is goddam wonderful.

19
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,195
I guess we're waiting for christmas.

20
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,911
You know, I got better things to do
than this.

21
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:08,712
Isn't it weird, how it all happens?
Columbo.

22
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,881
Boys and girls.

23
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:19,014
Do you know...
...what the internet is?

24
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:25,729
Well, you could read
some interesting news.

25
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:29,649
Or you could listen to

26
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,402
a nice song.

27
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:37,157
But - no no no no no.
No.

28
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,744
The Internet, come closer...

29
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:47,876
The Internet...
...is about sex,

30
00:02:57,093 --> 00:03:00,930
an infinite electronic complex

31
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:07,062
full of...

32
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:13,109
of unexpected turns.

33
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:17,155
Of course the other things
are also there,

34
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:21,785
pages of cars and gladiators,

35
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:25,955
neverending
but there's a way outta there

36
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:29,501
by a magic click
to another page

37
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:32,379
and there,
there are those naked chics,

38
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:37,550
those chics' moms,
or children,

39
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:45,016
a man shagging a dog or a pig.

40
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:51,648
Women,
and this is the worst of all,

41
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,693
playing with a horse's dick,
right there.

42
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:01,574
Well kids...

43
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:08,665
- Welcome to the internet.
- It's serious you fuckers.

44
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,210
You'll get addicted in no time.

45
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:22,095
Are you gonna roll
that joint forever?

46
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:31,021
Why are we drinking vodka,
for christ's sakes?

47
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:35,525
Why don't we have a pint down
at the pub? Are we in Siberia?

48
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,029
Globalization, man.

49
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:41,698
Shit.

50
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,746
Hello,
could you help me, please?

51
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:49,706
- Of course.
- I'm looking for doctor Bates,

52
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:52,167
the plastic surgeon.

53
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,919
The surgeon?

54
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,547
Plastic surgeon Bates?

55
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:03,887
Sorry. Down this hallway,
that door over there.

56
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:05,847
- The last one, right?
- At the very end.

57
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,308
- Thank's.
- You're welcome.

58
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:17,275
Wanna have a shower?

59
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:29,162
Man, have you ever wanked
to your class picture?

60
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:33,750
Not since last Friday.

61
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:37,962
"Have you seen, Friday 13th?"

62
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,715
Yeah, but my grandad walked in.

63
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,551
The best was Monika, man,

64
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,680
those perky tits,
those nipples...

65
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,557
Jesus and that Jana.

66
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,436
Man o man.

67
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,063
Kiss my ass you wankers.

68
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,110
- Hi.
- Hi.

69
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,744
You know Batman...

70
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:15,000
...the action hero.

71
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,380
Well we have a lot in common
him and I.

72
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:25,719
All action, magical,

73
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:27,929
but pretty lonely right now.

74
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,894
Want me to bring you
a hot dog and soda?

75
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,938
- No thanks.
- Come on.

76
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,982
No, really.

77
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,281
- Here you go.
- Hey!

78
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,952
Great.

79
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,789
You wouldn't believe this freak.

80
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:56,875
Where?

81
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:01,921
Him, there!

82
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,176
- Him?
- Some kinda pervert isn't he?

83
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,094
Yeah I guess he is.

84
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:29,157
It was damn good
the other day, man.

85
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:32,786
Not sure, but what's the name

86
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:36,539
of that fucking guy
who buys Bravo,

87
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,543
and jerks off three times

88
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:44,464
a fuckin' day

89
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:47,592
fuckin'anywhere man and...

90
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:51,012
If you didn't have your
sleeping-bag-chic,

91
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:53,264
you would too.

92
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:55,517
That was long ago.

93
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,690
Better than robbing banks
in fucking America.

94
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:06,444
This is a totally
different country.

95
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,406
- I love you, Honey Bunny.
- I love you, Pumpkin.

96
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:14,035
- You look great today.
- Thanks, good to see you,

97
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,871
I thought you forgot
all about me.

98
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,290
If I knew you were back

99
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,710
from England, I would've called.

100
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:25,046
You're so nice,

101
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,507
even in England it's rare,

102
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:32,929
most guys just want to jump
into bed with us.

103
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,015
And that's in the best case.

104
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:38,893
I'm so happy
we're together again, Petr.

105
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:40,937
Me too.

106
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:46,151
I got an idea.

107
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,404
Why don't we get a bottle
of wine and jump in bed?

108
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:53,450
You're such a pig.

109
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:59,539
This is a robbery, if any of you
fucking pricks move,

110
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:02,334
I'll execute every motherfucking
last one of ya'!

111
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:13,678
An unknown killer knick-named
Bleeding Kaleb

112
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,139
accused of 17 murders,

113
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:20,143
and two assassinations
of public servants,

114
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,103
he's assumed to be responsible

115
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,481
for another 21 unsolved murders,

116
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:27,108
the offender usually wears
a black leather coat.

117
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:29,611
It'll be luscious rose-petal,

118
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:34,407
straight from the thighs
of little Mulattos.

119
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,870
In skimpy little thongs.

120
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:46,753
The smell of that half-black
skin does it to me every time.

121
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,422
Shut up and roll.

122
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:11,945
Guys,

123
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:15,782
it's the fruit of the gods,
no shit.

124
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:16,134
T R A S H

125
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:21,181

Fuckin' hell. Jason's here...

133
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,310
sportin' a machete.

134
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:55,316
Horny silicon blond
with a case of beer.

135
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:58,361
I'm gonna open the door,
for both of 'em.

136
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,784
Look... Cactus.

137
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,329
Oh fuck, it is.

138
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,915
Hello, guys.

139
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,209
Don't get up, please.

140
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,920
I just came to borrow some milk,

141
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,423
going to make pudding.

142
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:20,383
Wanna drag?

143
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,302
- Strawberry.
- Wanna?

144
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:25,263
No, no, I'm on my way.

145
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:28,767
I might be back later.

146
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:33,897
Thank you, Honza.
Strawberry pudding.

147
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:36,900
Such a nice boy, thank you.

148
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:38,985
Shut the fuck up you wankers

149
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,154
and watch the table,
my folks got it as a present

150
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:44,074
from some friend from Africa
along with that little fucker.

151
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,785
One scratch and they'll have
my balls for book-ends.

152
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:50,955
I thought it was a Pokemon toy.

153
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,255
I wish you had the same.

154
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:03,426
Unbelievable,
I couldn't walk for two days.

155
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:06,971
Reminds me of that guy
I picked up at the disco.

156
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:14,020
Not much upstairs but
great in bed and he looked

157
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:16,856
exactly like Rickie.

158
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:18,525
How 'bout you, Adela?

159
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:20,318
I quite like Karel.

160
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,657
Leave her alone, you know
they get it on once in a while

161
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:29,661
and then once a year
she has an orgasm.

162
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,831
Yeah her own little Superhero.

163
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:38,128
Mr. Great,
the infallible Batman.

164
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:43,008
Up in the crow's nest
Two young sailors

165
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:47,512
Smoking havanas
Swinging their legs

166
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:52,350
The danger won't
Make them cry

167
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:56,813
While they stare off
Into the sea

168
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,252
I got an idea,

169
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,505
how about we invite
a bit of pussy over.

170
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:24,758
No hookers in this house, man.

171
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,054
Let's just chill, smoke a joint
and see what happens.

172
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,683
I'd give this one a chance.

173
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,769
These days it's totally common.

174
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:38,688
You've got a girlfriend,
don't you?

175
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:42,233
- Where's your morals?
- Don't get your shit in a knot.

176
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,694
A whore is a whore,

177
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:46,780
you pay you fuck, get it?

178
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:50,367
No strings attached my love.

179
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:51,910
What sweethearts!

180
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:53,661
Relax.

181
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:57,665
If you feel bad about it,
just get a blow job.

182
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,877
It's like wanking
with your left hand.

183
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:21,106
If it sucks,
we'll kick her out or kill her.

184
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:26,152
Once you have this place
to yourself...

185
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:29,155
Stab her to death.

186
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:32,409
You fuckers are corrupting me.

187
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:35,370
That reminds me of how Karel

188
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,249
picked up Adela by accident.

189
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,293
What do you mean, by accident?

190
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:45,380
He was hitting on Jana here,

191
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:49,968
but then he was so drunk he
crawled into your sleeping bag.

192
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:53,054
Must've been a shock.

193
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:58,309
Wait... didn't you know?

194
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,939
Shake off your crabs,
she's here in half hour.

195
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,608
He really thought
it was me under him.

196
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,612
But the point is, the whole time
he thought he was doing it with me.

197
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:18,038
But, don't worry about it,
Adela.

198
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,041
You are disgusting.

199
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:24,336
You're so lame, how can you
be so dumb and bitchy?

200
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:38,910
Fuck, here she is.

201
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:46,459
Are you gonna open the door
or what, you prick?

202
00:18:57,262 --> 00:18:59,514
Gentlemen, Ms Nicol.

203
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,840
Cool place,
have your parents left?

204
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:36,176
No, well,
I live here by myself,

205
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:42,015
my grandad got hit by a bus last
year. It was all quite ugly.

206
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:46,561
So what's the plan, boys?

207
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:50,857
A little strip-tease or do you
just wanna watch me get off?

208
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:54,944
A wank is cheaper,
so is a blow job.

209
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:56,988
I'll do it without a condom.

210
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:58,740
Fuck you,

211
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,702
you fucking low-life
I'm outta here.

212
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:05,747
Please excuse him.

213
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:09,084
He's just a bit nervous,
you know?

214
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:12,837
Turns me on,

215
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:15,924
I love nervous boys.

216
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:32,565
Do you have...

217
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:42,367
Nice. Now, how about money?

218
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,838
I guess we can
trust each other.

219
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:01,469
So?

220
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:09,227
Maybe a little strip-tease?
Just to warm up, right?

221
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:11,604
To relax...

222
00:21:12,355 --> 00:21:14,024
OK, as you please.

223
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,943
- I'll be right back.
- Sure.

224
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:26,786
God, I thank you

225
00:21:27,662 --> 00:21:31,166
for making me a man.

226
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:35,670
On Sunday I'll go to church and
pray, I swear.

227
00:21:35,754 --> 00:21:37,255
Fuck, I'm hungry.

228
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,007
There's nothing in the fridge.

229
00:21:39,382 --> 00:21:42,385
- Roll one up.
- Let's order some pizza you wankers.

230
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:45,013
Something with olives.

231
00:22:24,427 --> 00:22:28,473
Yeah, 1492 Elm Street.

232
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:36,981
That happens all the time.

233
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:40,068
- How much?
- Five hundred.

234
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:44,489
- You mean including delivery?
- No, we have to run out to the airport.

235
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:46,866
Yeah as if.

236
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:51,496
Shall we?

237
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:29,899
Don't stand there, young man,

238
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:34,529
you'll get sick

239
00:27:34,904 --> 00:27:36,906
and who'll pay then? Who?

240
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:39,325
Not me!

241
00:27:40,493 --> 00:27:43,371
Good evening, gentlemen,
here you are.

242
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:45,373
There'd better be olives on it.

243
00:27:45,582 --> 00:27:48,209
But of course,
they're included in the price.

244
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:53,590
What a mess. Having a party?

245
00:27:56,593 --> 00:27:58,053
A birthday party?

246
00:27:59,512 --> 00:28:01,514
Who's birthday is it?

247
00:28:03,683 --> 00:28:06,519
Well, happy birthday,

248
00:28:07,103 --> 00:28:09,689
I know a song.

249
00:28:12,108 --> 00:28:14,778
Well, what kind of party is it?

250
00:28:14,944 --> 00:28:17,280
I might join in,
maybe have a drink?

251
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:21,993
Well, let's talk business...

252
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:26,998
What, 901,50?

253
00:28:27,207 --> 00:28:30,335
- Who said five hundred?
- That's what they told me.

254
00:28:30,877 --> 00:28:32,337
Please let me explain.

255
00:28:32,462 --> 00:28:34,506
- That's my job, isn't it?
- Go on.

256
00:28:35,382 --> 00:28:39,010
Five hundred until 9 p.m.,

257
00:28:39,469 --> 00:28:42,472
and you called before 9.

258
00:28:42,722 --> 00:28:47,894
But your order
got registered at 9:01,

259
00:28:48,812 --> 00:28:52,399
that means a higher rate
and an additional charge,

260
00:28:53,316 --> 00:28:56,528
which is normal
in respectable companies

261
00:28:56,986 --> 00:28:59,239
with a wide range of costumers.

262
00:28:59,322 --> 00:29:01,574
Bla, bla, bla, bullshit,
Crusty the Clown! Little shit!

263
00:29:01,908 --> 00:29:02,867
Little git!

264
00:29:02,992 --> 00:29:05,578
Don't blame me, gentlemen,

265
00:29:05,995 --> 00:29:07,580
I'm just a little Pizza man

266
00:29:07,747 --> 00:29:11,501
in our complex.

267
00:29:13,253 --> 00:29:16,506
By the way the best pizza
complex on this planet.

268
00:29:17,007 --> 00:29:18,550
You won't be much longer.

269
00:29:20,343 --> 00:29:22,137
There's not much left, fuck.

270
00:29:23,263 --> 00:29:26,099
- I told you.
- Well, that's our pizza joint.

271
00:29:26,182 --> 00:29:28,059
- What pizza joint?
- Our pizza joint,

272
00:29:28,184 --> 00:29:31,229
the best in the town.
- What do you mean?

273
00:29:31,688 --> 00:29:34,524
- They make pizza there.
- No, it means you're

274
00:29:34,607 --> 00:29:36,776
the most expensive vehicle

275
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:39,696
in this fucking world.

276
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,365
But not much longer,
'cause I'm gonna shove

277
00:29:42,532 --> 00:29:44,284
that pizza up your ass.

278
00:29:44,868 --> 00:29:47,245
Fuck, that stupid cow.

279
00:29:48,455 --> 00:29:51,291
You've smoked your brains out.

280
00:29:51,624 --> 00:29:53,918
She's frigid as a fish,

281
00:29:56,379 --> 00:29:58,673
I might as well screw Adela.

282
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:01,551
- What?
- Nothing, that's what.

283
00:30:03,136 --> 00:30:05,847
She's lying there, right,
so I thought

284
00:30:05,972 --> 00:30:07,557
she's tired after you,

285
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,810
she wants to play,

286
00:30:11,394 --> 00:30:14,147
wanted to help her,
got all naked and...

287
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:16,858
- You're sleeping with one woman?
- Shut the fuck up.

288
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:18,693
She's numb, so I wanted

289
00:30:18,902 --> 00:30:21,571
to turn her on,

290
00:30:21,905 --> 00:30:24,824
warm her up and nothing.

291
00:30:26,576 --> 00:30:28,161
For all that money...

292
00:30:28,495 --> 00:30:30,163
You are paying her?

293
00:30:31,414 --> 00:30:33,917
It's a prostitute.

294
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:35,794
- Do you know that...
- Shut up, fuck you, fuck them

295
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:38,672
and fuck her,

296
00:30:38,838 --> 00:30:40,340
I'm gonna kick her out.

297
00:30:49,015 --> 00:30:52,060
Well, what a party.

298
00:31:06,783 --> 00:31:09,744
Well, it looks like trouble,
my friends.

299
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,831
Check her pulse, surely,

300
00:31:13,373 --> 00:31:16,209
the pulse is the main thing.
- Go fuck yourself.

301
00:31:16,376 --> 00:31:19,504
Oh no, I've got time.

302
00:31:24,884 --> 00:31:28,596
That bitch, it's borax.

303
00:31:29,639 --> 00:31:31,725
I'm not even breathing

304
00:31:31,975 --> 00:31:35,103
not to mess up that table,

305
00:31:36,396 --> 00:31:39,065
and look at her.

306
00:31:39,649 --> 00:31:41,317
She's dead, man.

307
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:46,489
She's fucking dead, man.

308
00:32:04,257 --> 00:32:07,093
For fuck's sake, man,

309
00:32:07,427 --> 00:32:10,513
shit I shagged a corpse.

310
00:32:13,933 --> 00:32:16,853
I'm a necrophiliac,

311
00:32:20,357 --> 00:32:22,192
don't even know what it means.

312
00:32:24,027 --> 00:32:26,696
I should've watched Rambo...

313
00:32:27,364 --> 00:32:28,990
Fuck it, man,

314
00:32:29,449 --> 00:32:30,992
no one's gonna know.

315
00:32:31,284 --> 00:32:34,204
What d'ya mean no one?

316
00:32:34,371 --> 00:32:37,123
- I know.
- Keep it to yourself.

317
00:32:41,211 --> 00:32:43,421
Adela's gonna find out

318
00:32:44,214 --> 00:32:47,509
and when we're in bed,

319
00:32:48,718 --> 00:32:50,553
she's gonna say

320
00:32:50,637 --> 00:32:52,722
"Man what's that smell?"

321
00:32:52,806 --> 00:32:55,016
"You shagged a corpse?"

322
00:32:55,141 --> 00:32:57,644
"No honey, I love you."

323
00:32:58,645 --> 00:33:01,189
Fuck.

324
00:33:01,564 --> 00:33:05,527
How about a little help?

325
00:33:06,736 --> 00:33:09,823
I need a new bike
for deliveries or...

326
00:33:10,573 --> 00:33:13,535
Scooter, small one's fine.

327
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,328
How about a punch in the face?

328
00:33:15,495 --> 00:33:19,040
Out of all the fucking beds
in the world,

329
00:33:19,165 --> 00:33:22,794
she has to die in this one.

330
00:33:24,087 --> 00:33:26,673
Should we talk money

331
00:33:27,007 --> 00:33:29,009
or shall I call the cops?

332
00:33:29,092 --> 00:33:32,178
Back off you son of a bitch.

333
00:33:32,595 --> 00:33:36,766
I know some people there,
just to...

334
00:33:41,855 --> 00:33:43,982
Careful, you fuck.

335
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,943
Better get used to it, fucker.

336
00:34:32,322 --> 00:34:33,823
What about this whore?

337
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:36,284
Let him rot in there,
that little fuck.

338
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,661
The one in the bedroom.

339
00:34:40,163 --> 00:34:43,249
Chop her up and bury her

340
00:34:44,167 --> 00:34:47,545
in the garden?
- We ain't got a garden.

341
00:34:49,422 --> 00:34:50,882
That sucks.

342
00:35:01,851 --> 00:35:03,353
Are ya' kidding?

343
00:35:06,106 --> 00:35:07,607
Fuck me.

344
00:35:13,697 --> 00:35:15,490
Hi, looking for someone?

345
00:35:17,534 --> 00:35:19,661
Sure, I'm lggy,

346
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:22,038
is my friend still here?

347
00:35:22,122 --> 00:35:24,499
He was, but we paid him
and he's gone.

348
00:35:26,793 --> 00:35:28,628
I mean Nicol, you asshole.

349
00:35:28,878 --> 00:35:30,630
- He's the fucking Cleaner!
- Don't let him in.

350
00:35:30,714 --> 00:35:32,257
Shut up!

351
00:35:35,844 --> 00:35:38,096
You're her boyfriend?

352
00:35:38,221 --> 00:35:41,641
No,
I'm a bouncer and a problem solver,

353
00:35:41,725 --> 00:35:44,477
first let me check this place
out, to make sure there's no cameras

354
00:35:44,644 --> 00:35:47,647
or nothin' and I'm outta here.

355
00:35:48,356 --> 00:35:51,151
- Wassup?
- Come in.

356
00:35:51,234 --> 00:35:52,777
All right.

357
00:35:58,283 --> 00:36:00,160
I know who you are.

358
00:36:01,411 --> 00:36:04,998
Fuck off.
It's Nicol's bouncer.

359
00:36:05,081 --> 00:36:06,624
What d'ya mean, bouncer?

360
00:36:08,835 --> 00:36:11,796
You're Honza, right?
So, to start with,

361
00:36:13,131 --> 00:36:15,550
I'd like a pull on that.

362
00:36:16,092 --> 00:36:18,928
I got a cool job.

363
00:36:19,512 --> 00:36:22,432
So one time I came for Nicol
to one of her tricks

364
00:36:24,768 --> 00:36:27,145
and some painted up weirdo
motherfucker opened the door.

365
00:36:27,228 --> 00:36:28,980
He wouldn't let me in,

366
00:36:29,105 --> 00:36:31,608
kept saying it'll be O.K.

367
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,902
That I can go and have a cigarette.

368
00:36:35,278 --> 00:36:37,822
I didn't trust him.
My dad used to say:

369
00:36:37,947 --> 00:36:41,076
"Never trust friends and
dudes with big cocks."

370
00:36:41,201 --> 00:36:44,204
So I walked in and the place
looked like a fucking dungeon...

371
00:36:47,624 --> 00:36:50,502
Nicol's chained to a table

372
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:53,463
all covered in rooster's blood

373
00:36:53,797 --> 00:36:56,966
and those mofos jerking off

374
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:59,302
howling fot Satan.

375
00:37:03,723 --> 00:37:06,226
That one prick
was dressed up like a goat

376
00:37:06,393 --> 00:37:09,437
Cool,
hooves, stuck it down his throat

377
00:37:09,562 --> 00:37:13,149
and then threw him
out some window.

378
00:37:13,358 --> 00:37:15,610
I think you ought
to know something.

379
00:37:16,319 --> 00:37:18,697
Look, this fuckin' sucks,

380
00:37:18,822 --> 00:37:20,865
just tell me where she is.

381
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:24,327
- Well, something happened.
- Wasn't our fault.

382
00:37:25,078 --> 00:37:28,790
It's like running over snails.

383
00:37:29,249 --> 00:37:31,960
Stop talking shit,

384
00:37:32,168 --> 00:37:34,838
are you on drugs?

385
00:37:37,841 --> 00:37:40,427
Jesus, that's Pizza man!

386
00:37:41,428 --> 00:37:43,763
Man, you know
Nicol's on some shit?

387
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,682
Shit?

388
00:37:47,225 --> 00:37:48,768
What d'ya mean?

389
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:52,397
Oh, that. Once she took it

390
00:37:52,981 --> 00:37:55,358
and ended up
with those Witnesses...

391
00:37:55,525 --> 00:37:57,318
You mean Jehova's.

392
00:37:57,527 --> 00:37:59,237
Yeah, that's the fucker's name.

393
00:37:59,362 --> 00:38:01,906
He must've been loaded 'cause

394
00:38:02,115 --> 00:38:05,493
people never talk shit about him.

395
00:38:06,369 --> 00:38:09,122
She wore fucking white, talking

396
00:38:09,789 --> 00:38:12,208
God all the fucking time.

397
00:38:13,376 --> 00:38:14,878
Jehova is God's name, man.

398
00:38:15,045 --> 00:38:17,172
I was named after dude from TV,

399
00:38:17,297 --> 00:38:19,007
quite a cool movie,

400
00:38:19,632 --> 00:38:21,718
about mommy who wants
to drown her little boy

401
00:38:21,926 --> 00:38:25,180
and a big mofo croc jumps out

402
00:38:25,305 --> 00:38:28,391
and bites her black head

403
00:38:28,558 --> 00:38:31,353
clean off.

404
00:38:31,561 --> 00:38:33,063
Fuck me.

405
00:38:33,229 --> 00:38:35,482
It was on Mississippi,

406
00:38:36,149 --> 00:38:37,650
Mississippi...

407
00:38:39,736 --> 00:38:41,863
a cruel river...

408
00:38:43,531 --> 00:38:45,075
Damn cruel river.

409
00:38:46,826 --> 00:38:49,871
Well, where's my girl?

410
00:38:52,499 --> 00:38:56,252
Fuck, she's dead.
What happened?

411
00:38:56,836 --> 00:38:59,005
She could manage a whole army,

412
00:38:59,339 --> 00:39:00,965
now I'll have to find another.

413
00:39:01,424 --> 00:39:03,218
- Called the cops yet?
- Not yet.

414
00:39:03,426 --> 00:39:05,512
Cool,
'cause I'd kick your heads in.

415
00:39:08,056 --> 00:39:09,516
Well, we'll leave her

416
00:39:11,518 --> 00:39:14,104
'till tomorrow...
- You mean overnight?

417
00:39:14,312 --> 00:39:16,564
She won't fucking bite.

418
00:39:17,023 --> 00:39:19,067
I'll be back.

419
00:39:19,693 --> 00:39:22,028
Bring gallons of acid, right?

420
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:23,822
Sure man, the fucking juice,

421
00:39:23,947 --> 00:39:26,157
right, you're a genius?

422
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:34,082
Now we're fucked.

423
00:39:40,046 --> 00:39:42,340
- Hi.
- Hi.

424
00:39:43,633 --> 00:39:47,095
I saw you walking up.

425
00:39:48,054 --> 00:39:49,723
Great, I didn't.

426
00:39:50,306 --> 00:39:53,351
I was actually peeking,

427
00:39:53,476 --> 00:39:56,688
you couldn't have...

428
00:39:56,813 --> 00:39:59,858
Usually I peek at my door.

429
00:40:01,234 --> 00:40:04,446
Exactly, that's what I meant.

430
00:40:05,321 --> 00:40:08,742
We've got lots in common,
don't you think?

431
00:40:09,576 --> 00:40:12,996
I'm lonely,

432
00:40:14,664 --> 00:40:18,960
so alone in this cruel world.

433
00:40:22,505 --> 00:40:25,258
Shall we put her
in the freezer?

434
00:40:25,508 --> 00:40:27,677
So she won't blow up,
like corpses do.

435
00:40:28,428 --> 00:40:31,097
If that fucker dies,
folks're gonna kill me.

436
00:40:32,182 --> 00:40:34,768
Fuck it,
we'll just get another.

437
00:40:34,934 --> 00:40:37,687
Where? In a supermarket?

438
00:40:38,605 --> 00:40:42,567
From the Chinky market, man,

439
00:40:42,692 --> 00:40:44,444
they have everything.

440
00:40:45,028 --> 00:40:46,780
Let's cover her up...

441
00:40:47,697 --> 00:40:49,282
saw it in a film once, some shit

442
00:40:49,366 --> 00:40:50,909
about respect for the dead.

443
00:40:51,117 --> 00:40:55,997
You do it so you don't have
to look at them.

444
00:41:12,555 --> 00:41:14,683
I knew it'd come handy one day.

445
00:41:15,141 --> 00:41:16,768
Let's have a fucking shot.

446
00:41:57,350 --> 00:41:59,394
Fabio, bro, how's business?

447
00:42:08,445 --> 00:42:10,447
Get fucked, lggy, come on in.

448
00:42:11,781 --> 00:42:16,161
Hey lggy, you look tired.
Any chic problems?

449
00:42:16,953 --> 00:42:19,205
It's just all going wrong,
y'know?

450
00:42:19,539 --> 00:42:21,708
Talking of which,
you owe me some dosh.

451
00:42:22,959 --> 00:42:24,669
Your whores ain't putting out?

452
00:42:24,878 --> 00:42:27,339
They do.

453
00:42:31,134 --> 00:42:33,470
Stop chewing
when you talk to me.

454
00:42:34,512 --> 00:42:38,516
Don't get smart,
whores are the best business,

455
00:42:38,683 --> 00:42:42,270
other than fucking weapons,
of course.

456
00:42:44,481 --> 00:42:45,982
Fabio, I'm in deep shit.

457
00:42:46,232 --> 00:42:51,112
Iggy, you're pissing me off,

458
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:56,993
no money,

459
00:42:57,911 --> 00:42:59,871
so fuck you.

460
00:43:00,246 --> 00:43:03,375
- Come on, man.
- Fuck you and your problems.

461
00:43:03,583 --> 00:43:06,628
Some guys had a party with Nicol,

462
00:43:06,753 --> 00:43:08,713
she overdosed and woke up dead.

463
00:43:08,838 --> 00:43:11,883
That's none of my business,
man, none of yours either.

464
00:43:13,093 --> 00:43:16,805
- As long as you got your money.
- Well...

465
00:43:17,597 --> 00:43:19,224
You didn't get it?

466
00:43:19,516 --> 00:43:23,353
Who d'ya think we are,
some kinda jokers?

467
00:43:23,853 --> 00:43:26,147
You're gonna bring me that money
tomorrow, as good friends do.

468
00:43:26,898 --> 00:43:29,234
But dad...

469
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:32,779
Don't you call me Dad at work.

470
00:43:34,864 --> 00:43:36,491
Family!

471
00:43:37,867 --> 00:43:40,662
Gonna be OK, bro,

472
00:43:41,496 --> 00:43:43,206
just get the money,

473
00:43:44,874 --> 00:43:46,626
and have some fun, man.

474
00:43:48,294 --> 00:43:50,547
Stick with us, bro, I tell ya.

475
00:45:47,997 --> 00:45:49,499
Hello.

476
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,358
Shit.

477
00:46:21,698 --> 00:46:23,700
- Wake up, Honza.
- What's the time?

478
00:46:23,783 --> 00:46:26,578
- Dude, it's your grandpa.
- Well, it is...

479
00:46:28,288 --> 00:46:29,873
But he's alive.

480
00:46:30,373 --> 00:46:32,250
Pa, for God's sake, what's up?

481
00:46:32,459 --> 00:46:34,127
Don't swear, boy,

482
00:46:34,294 --> 00:46:37,339
you know I don't like it.

483
00:46:37,464 --> 00:46:39,215
Did you sleep all right?

484
00:46:39,466 --> 00:46:41,301
All right.

485
00:46:41,634 --> 00:46:43,178
That's right.

486
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:48,391
Good, I wanted to wake you up,
not to miss lunch.

487
00:46:48,975 --> 00:46:51,811
It's no good when it's cold.

488
00:46:52,562 --> 00:46:55,815
Well, introduce us.

489
00:46:56,316 --> 00:46:59,652
Hello, I'm Honza's grandpa.

490
00:46:59,736 --> 00:47:03,823
You're our Honza's girlfriend?

491
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:07,577
I'm Karel.
Honza's not exactly my type.

492
00:47:09,412 --> 00:47:13,249
Sorry, it's the long hair.

493
00:47:13,416 --> 00:47:17,253
Karel...

494
00:47:18,421 --> 00:47:23,301
The one who takes morph,
morphium?

495
00:47:23,927 --> 00:47:25,428
You should quit,

496
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:28,765
it's bad for you.

497
00:47:29,933 --> 00:47:32,852
In my times, it was in, too.

498
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:37,691
We've never been too nosey, but
I hope you're not doing this.

499
00:47:38,858 --> 00:47:42,070
Of course I'm not.

500
00:47:42,195 --> 00:47:45,532
I am Honza's grandpa.

501
00:47:45,615 --> 00:47:47,659
I know, from his dad's side,
I'm Petr.

502
00:47:47,784 --> 00:47:49,786
Hello.

503
00:47:50,286 --> 00:47:52,789
Yes, let's sit down and eat.

504
00:47:55,125 --> 00:47:58,712
Nothing's worse than cold lunch.

505
00:47:58,878 --> 00:48:01,214
Maybe a cold woman.

506
00:48:01,464 --> 00:48:05,760
The young lady won't join us?

507
00:48:05,885 --> 00:48:07,846
Pa, I told you it's Karel.

508
00:48:08,471 --> 00:48:11,016
I mean the one in the bedroom.

509
00:48:14,644 --> 00:48:16,312
Pa, you've seen Nicol?

510
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:18,940
She's Hungarian?

511
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:24,195
Good choice, boy, passionate.

512
00:48:24,654 --> 00:48:26,489
Bring her in, be polite.

513
00:48:29,075 --> 00:48:32,037
She's invited, or else

514
00:48:32,495 --> 00:48:34,873
I'll have to tell your parents.

515
00:48:38,752 --> 00:48:42,297
- I promise I won't hit on her.
- Pa...

516
00:48:42,589 --> 00:48:44,299
You two keep talking,

517
00:48:44,424 --> 00:48:47,344
we'll get her.

518
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:49,804
Good idea.

519
00:48:50,764 --> 00:48:53,641
I don't think so, she gets
grumpy when you wake her up.

520
00:48:53,767 --> 00:48:57,645
It's cool, Honza. Right, man?

521
00:48:58,271 --> 00:48:59,773
Sure.

522
00:49:10,784 --> 00:49:12,619
I'd bet she stinks a bit.

523
00:49:16,039 --> 00:49:17,540
I don't think so.

524
00:49:18,291 --> 00:49:20,126
She hasn't been here long, has she?

525
00:49:23,046 --> 00:49:24,506
No,

526
00:49:25,215 --> 00:49:29,511
but it's that sweet smell, like
in a crematorium, you know?

527
00:49:30,553 --> 00:49:32,764
Grandpa won't smell it.

528
00:49:33,473 --> 00:49:35,183
He's deaf and blind.

529
00:49:36,142 --> 00:49:37,686
I wouldn't take this, y'know,

530
00:49:38,395 --> 00:49:40,397
I mean senses,

531
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:44,859
one gets worse, another
gets better, know what I mean?

532
00:49:45,735 --> 00:49:48,238
Let's hope it's his touch.

533
00:49:49,239 --> 00:49:54,369
Man, she's gonna be fucking
awful, dunno but...

534
00:50:27,944 --> 00:50:32,240
Hello, I'm Honza's grandpa.

535
00:50:34,034 --> 00:50:38,163
Sorry to wake you up,

536
00:50:38,288 --> 00:50:40,707
but hot lunch will do you good.

537
00:50:45,295 --> 00:50:50,467
Granny made the best gravy,

538
00:50:51,634 --> 00:50:54,095
but she left me

539
00:50:54,471 --> 00:50:58,767
for an older man,

540
00:50:59,225 --> 00:51:00,810
with a younger car...

541
00:51:00,894 --> 00:51:04,397
It might've been
those Fridays of mine...

542
00:51:05,482 --> 00:51:10,195
Close your eyes...

543
00:51:11,321 --> 00:51:15,408
I'm leaving...

544
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:23,416
Good for you!

545
00:51:24,751 --> 00:51:27,504
Well, I'll have to go,

546
00:51:29,005 --> 00:51:33,176
have a date with an ex-baroness.

547
00:51:34,094 --> 00:51:37,180
She wants opera,

548
00:51:38,181 --> 00:51:41,935
maybe a bottle of wine
will change her mind.

549
00:51:51,861 --> 00:51:53,738
Pa, you're late,

550
00:51:53,863 --> 00:51:55,573
she's waiting. Come on...

551
00:52:02,872 --> 00:52:05,542
Thanks for lunch, 't was great.

552
00:52:08,128 --> 00:52:11,089
Get rat poison,

553
00:52:11,214 --> 00:52:14,300
- I saw some in the cupboard.
- All right

554
00:52:14,968 --> 00:52:16,928
They're spreading diseases.

555
00:52:18,972 --> 00:52:24,060
Both doctors,
and such a filthy place.

556
00:52:28,231 --> 00:52:32,652
But that girl, boy,
she's beautiful.

557
00:52:32,736 --> 00:52:34,237
Good bye, Pa.

558
00:52:34,571 --> 00:52:38,158
Maybe I could invite her
for a drink?

559
00:52:38,491 --> 00:52:41,703
Bye, Pa.

560
00:52:44,164 --> 00:52:44,956
Bye.

561
00:52:45,081 --> 00:52:47,667
Bye and say hello
to your parents.

562
00:52:56,426 --> 00:52:58,428
Grandpa's cool, man.

563
00:52:58,845 --> 00:53:01,139
Glad you're having fun,
you fucks.

564
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:10,315
It's lggy. Sorry I didn't call
earlier, family stuff.

565
00:53:13,193 --> 00:53:14,736
One forgets.

566
00:53:15,528 --> 00:53:17,739
Were am I?
You wouldn't believe it,

567
00:53:17,947 --> 00:53:20,533
but back to business,
you fucked up,

568
00:53:21,034 --> 00:53:23,495
you have to deal with it.
Fuck it, I'm out.

569
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:25,997
Man, they're having lunch there,

570
00:53:26,122 --> 00:53:28,667
grandpa thinks she's my girl,
and I'm supposed to be cool.

571
00:53:32,879 --> 00:53:34,881
But she's your whore.

572
00:53:35,465 --> 00:53:38,510
True, but I ain't gonna lose

573
00:53:38,635 --> 00:53:40,595
business for one fucking whore.

574
00:53:40,887 --> 00:53:42,639
I got a good idea,

575
00:53:42,722 --> 00:53:45,892
let's call the cops.

576
00:53:46,226 --> 00:53:48,228
Call the cops and they'll be

577
00:53:48,395 --> 00:53:50,772
scraping you off the walls.

578
00:53:53,149 --> 00:53:54,901
Don't forget
I know where you live.

579
00:53:55,568 --> 00:53:57,779
I'll be back for the money.

580
00:54:15,922 --> 00:54:17,716
Look, Jackie Chan.

581
00:54:18,008 --> 00:54:20,135
Yes, it's him.

582
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:22,637
That sonofabitch
left us in the shit.

583
00:54:23,013 --> 00:54:24,764
Well, he won't get anything.

584
00:54:26,599 --> 00:54:28,184
Too bad there's no fireplace.

585
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:32,313
Or a chipper.

586
00:54:33,023 --> 00:54:35,734
Let's put her in the hallway
and call the cops,

587
00:54:35,859 --> 00:54:37,485
and say we found her there.

588
00:54:39,195 --> 00:54:40,697
No fucking way.

589
00:54:41,614 --> 00:54:43,199
They'd know she overdosed,

590
00:54:43,283 --> 00:54:44,993
and that we all shagged her.

591
00:54:46,369 --> 00:54:48,413
They'll know, dude,

592
00:54:48,621 --> 00:54:50,457
'cause of fucking genetics.

593
00:54:51,124 --> 00:54:53,626
Don't tell me
she only shagged just us.

594
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:56,504
Maybe even Batman.

595
00:54:57,047 --> 00:54:59,424
Her biggest catch was Karel.

596
00:55:01,301 --> 00:55:04,346
There's gotta be a way
to get rid of a damn corpse.

597
00:55:04,888 --> 00:55:06,514
Everybody does it.

598
00:55:07,307 --> 00:55:09,601
We could bury her under the
rose bush, if you had a house.

599
00:55:12,479 --> 00:55:15,565
- Like in the D.I. Y show.
- Everybody knows now, right?

600
00:55:16,316 --> 00:55:18,318
What?

601
00:55:18,485 --> 00:55:19,944
That that guy Jim
buries corpses?

602
00:55:21,321 --> 00:55:23,907
Just take her far away

603
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:28,161
where no one will
fucking find her.

604
00:55:42,676 --> 00:55:44,678
No one's gonna care,

605
00:55:45,011 --> 00:55:48,390
if they did, that hippie
wouldn't have found her here.

606
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:53,395
What if she's some
Ukrainian student

607
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:56,940
and now the mafia's after us?

608
00:55:57,190 --> 00:55:59,234
Yeah, the whole mafia's

609
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:03,321
studying here
to become lawyers, you asshole.

610
00:56:04,531 --> 00:56:07,283
I got an idea.

611
00:56:07,951 --> 00:56:09,619
Be cool, man,
just chill back.

612
00:56:10,704 --> 00:56:12,706
I don't give a fuck,
I can walk all day.

613
00:56:12,956 --> 00:56:16,084
He's the one with a dead whore
in bedroom, not me.

614
00:56:16,209 --> 00:56:18,003
Fuck that, man, shit,

615
00:56:18,128 --> 00:56:20,130
I'm just looking for a car.

616
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:22,924
Pardon me, I didn't know.

617
00:56:23,049 --> 00:56:26,136
I got my connection here,

618
00:56:26,636 --> 00:56:28,096
this little dude.

619
00:56:28,221 --> 00:56:30,598
When Skywalker's in trouble,
he'll help,

620
00:56:30,724 --> 00:56:32,892
always wherever he's needed.

621
00:56:33,143 --> 00:56:35,186
- Where d'ya wanna take her to?

622
00:56:35,645 --> 00:56:37,397
Where?

623
00:56:38,064 --> 00:56:40,400
- Where? To the Singing Cactus.
- Fuck that.

624
00:56:41,818 --> 00:56:43,319
Hey, Tony.

625
00:56:43,903 --> 00:56:45,530
Hey, Carlito, how's things?

626
00:56:45,905 --> 00:56:47,532
Cool car.

627
00:56:47,657 --> 00:56:49,159
- Good deal, interested?
- How much?

628
00:56:49,325 --> 00:56:51,161
Eight grand.

629
00:57:01,838 --> 00:57:03,757
You little shit,
two's enough and you know it.

630
00:57:06,176 --> 00:57:08,636
I've got family, Carlito,

631
00:57:08,762 --> 00:57:11,639
mom's sick, sister's pregnant,
kids want to study.

632
00:57:12,098 --> 00:57:14,642
Bullshit, you fuck,

633
00:57:14,934 --> 00:57:17,145
your mom's a whore in Vegas,

634
00:57:17,270 --> 00:57:19,731
your sister is now a brother,

635
00:57:19,856 --> 00:57:21,858
and there's no kids.

636
00:57:26,863 --> 00:57:28,698
Two grand, gentlemen.

637
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:35,580
Honza...

638
00:57:35,872 --> 00:57:37,582
- Why me again?
- Who else?

639
00:57:39,626 --> 00:57:41,670
Fucking losers.

640
00:58:00,897 --> 00:58:03,900
Keys're in there,
have fun, Carlito.

641
00:58:03,983 --> 00:58:05,694
You too, dude.

642
00:58:08,154 --> 00:58:09,698
Here.

643
00:58:11,491 --> 00:58:14,285
Who the fuck is this?

644
00:58:14,494 --> 00:58:16,037
What d'ya want? Phone number?

645
00:58:16,162 --> 00:58:17,539
Better throw it away.

646
00:58:17,664 --> 00:58:19,165
Nothing's here.

647
00:58:20,166 --> 00:58:21,668
Just go.

648
00:58:44,441 --> 00:58:45,984
Mom...

649
00:58:57,037 --> 00:59:00,248
- What?
- Sir, those boys stole your car.

650
00:59:01,541 --> 00:59:05,253
Could've told me,
I was right there.

651
00:59:05,378 --> 00:59:08,006
Didn't want to disturb you,
thought you were workin'.

652
00:59:08,131 --> 00:59:09,591
Did you do it?

653
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:12,802
I wanted to stop them
but couldn't.

654
00:59:14,804 --> 00:59:18,600
Next time I might
not take you with me.

655
00:59:19,476 --> 00:59:21,478
Is that some kind of responsibility?

656
00:59:21,561 --> 00:59:23,855
Got something, it might help.

657
00:59:24,397 --> 00:59:26,191
Nothing's for free, though.

658
00:59:26,399 --> 00:59:27,901
I stole it.

659
00:59:46,169 --> 00:59:48,213
One day you'll be something,

660
00:59:48,505 --> 00:59:50,507
at least like me.

661
00:59:51,508 --> 00:59:53,802
Keep trying, nothing's for free.

662
00:59:56,930 --> 00:59:59,391
When do we start? I wanna be
an assassin, just like you.

663
01:00:02,769 --> 01:00:04,604
There's still time.

664
01:00:11,611 --> 01:00:13,655
- Put her in the trunk.
- What?

665
01:00:14,030 --> 01:00:15,532
In the trunk, man.

666
01:00:15,699 --> 01:00:17,200
How, trunk?

667
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:27,252
For fuck's sake,
can't put her in there,

668
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:29,004
it's a dead whore,

669
01:00:29,129 --> 01:00:30,755
first cop that looks in,

670
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:33,925
this isn't fucking Italy.

671
01:00:34,134 --> 01:00:36,052
Don't fucking care where she is,

672
01:00:36,136 --> 01:00:38,179
as long as it's not in mom's bed.

673
01:00:38,972 --> 01:00:40,974
All right then,

674
01:00:41,975 --> 01:00:44,019
put her in here.

675
01:00:48,148 --> 01:00:50,984
Great, let's go...

676
01:01:03,246 --> 01:01:04,748
Fuck.

677
01:01:59,052 --> 01:02:02,305
Fucking awesome...

678
01:02:02,722 --> 01:02:05,850
Iook at those cars.
- Fuck the cars.

679
01:02:05,975 --> 01:02:07,644
So cool, man,

680
01:02:08,728 --> 01:02:11,439
cars moving up and down,

681
01:02:11,564 --> 01:02:13,858
left and right

682
01:02:14,401 --> 01:02:17,153
Yeah, great.

683
01:02:17,487 --> 01:02:19,239
Fuck you.

684
01:02:20,657 --> 01:02:22,283
Shut up and drive.

685
01:02:41,261 --> 01:02:42,804
Karel.

686
01:02:44,347 --> 01:02:45,890
Hear me?

687
01:02:50,353 --> 01:02:52,731
Sure, I might've known.

688
01:02:54,274 --> 01:02:56,234
Who's that whore?

689
01:02:58,111 --> 01:03:00,697
It's her time
of the month again?

690
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:05,910
Watch out, if you don't

691
01:03:06,036 --> 01:03:08,496
open up, you're in deep shit.

692
01:03:08,621 --> 01:03:10,874
And so are
those fucking assholes.

693
01:03:12,042 --> 01:03:15,003
Start the car, man,
fucking get moving.

694
01:03:43,656 --> 01:03:48,370
Adela, my sweetheart,
wanna ride?

695
01:03:48,495 --> 01:03:52,415
Somewhere...

696
01:04:07,097 --> 01:04:08,765
- What's wrong with'er?
- She's just dead.

697
01:04:09,015 --> 01:04:10,600
We found her like that.

698
01:04:11,017 --> 01:04:12,852
Petr...

699
01:04:13,103 --> 01:04:15,897
Fucking pals, right?

700
01:04:16,523 --> 01:04:18,149
Nice.

701
01:04:18,358 --> 01:04:20,694
Shall I make up my own story?

702
01:04:21,027 --> 01:04:24,072
What if you killed her,
then raped her?

703
01:04:25,198 --> 01:04:26,783
Wouldn't be surprised.

704
01:04:27,701 --> 01:04:29,744
- Are you gonna tell'er?
- What?

705
01:04:30,537 --> 01:04:32,288
You're going to, anyway.

706
01:04:32,622 --> 01:04:34,457
Know what? Fuck that shit.

707
01:04:51,975 --> 01:04:54,936
Calm down, I'm coming.

708
01:05:05,155 --> 01:05:09,659
- Hello.
- Good afternoon.

709
01:05:13,496 --> 01:05:15,540
May I help you?

710
01:05:16,666 --> 01:05:19,085
Are you the land lady?

711
01:05:21,087 --> 01:05:24,591
I own this place.

712
01:05:24,674 --> 01:05:29,763
I also work here,
just to save money.

713
01:05:29,846 --> 01:05:33,224
It's hard to find
a decent person, nowadays...

714
01:05:33,350 --> 01:05:36,144
Do the Bates live here?

715
01:05:42,275 --> 01:05:43,902
Something happened?

716
01:05:46,863 --> 01:05:48,531
You've got a problem.

717
01:05:54,371 --> 01:05:55,872
Me?

718
01:06:01,795 --> 01:06:04,130
Dammit!

719
01:06:06,049 --> 01:06:08,927
Screw this.

720
01:06:09,052 --> 01:06:10,553
What now, Adela?

721
01:06:10,637 --> 01:06:12,639
I'm soaking wet...

722
01:06:12,722 --> 01:06:14,265
Sorry, man.

723
01:06:14,391 --> 01:06:17,560
- Just throw her out.
- Shall I throw'er out?

724
01:06:17,644 --> 01:06:20,063
Look at me.

725
01:06:22,315 --> 01:06:24,317
Fuck off.

726
01:06:25,735 --> 01:06:27,237
Screw you.

727
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:29,447
Shall I - throw'er out?

728
01:06:29,572 --> 01:06:31,241
Get in and we will go.
So three days, you fucker!

729
01:06:33,910 --> 01:06:36,371
Covered in piss.

730
01:07:05,108 --> 01:07:07,610
Quite a nice place,

731
01:07:09,612 --> 01:07:12,365
do you think they steal,

732
01:07:14,034 --> 01:07:16,036
or even kill?

733
01:07:17,454 --> 01:07:18,997
Who knows,

734
01:07:20,874 --> 01:07:24,377
better stick
to the "NTA" rule.

735
01:07:26,046 --> 01:07:28,089
"NTA" rule?

736
01:07:29,549 --> 01:07:31,551
What's that?

737
01:07:32,218 --> 01:07:36,723
Never Trust Anyone.

738
01:07:42,228 --> 01:07:44,022
NTA, easy.

739
01:07:46,483 --> 01:07:50,570
You little adventurer.

740
01:07:52,989 --> 01:07:56,076
I get so lonely,

741
01:07:58,161 --> 01:08:02,499
if you only knew how sad it is.

742
01:08:39,285 --> 01:08:41,663
Dear wedding guests.

743
01:08:43,289 --> 01:08:45,291
I'm here for my dosh...

744
01:08:47,877 --> 01:08:50,380
you got it?

745
01:08:52,549 --> 01:08:54,592
You're not one of those asses,
are ya?

746
01:08:57,220 --> 01:08:59,347
- Where did they go?
- Don't ask me, I just got here.

747
01:08:59,472 --> 01:09:02,517
You might know better.

748
01:09:04,227 --> 01:09:05,812
Are you waiting here
for'em or what?

749
01:09:08,648 --> 01:09:10,233
Maybe.

750
01:09:10,483 --> 01:09:13,987
So you think you're tough?

751
01:09:14,654 --> 01:09:16,698
The biggest, right?

752
01:09:22,829 --> 01:09:25,665
Hate Italian.

753
01:09:30,754 --> 01:09:33,381
- Got a car?
- You bet.

754
01:09:47,270 --> 01:09:50,690
Sir, why have you
shot my horse?

755
01:09:51,441 --> 01:09:53,568
No it's the two of us, pal,

756
01:09:55,278 --> 01:09:57,405
just like the TV heroes.

757
01:09:57,530 --> 01:09:59,741
You watch TV, don't ya?
Dog and cat.

758
01:10:01,534 --> 01:10:03,536
Is there anything after you die?

759
01:10:05,121 --> 01:10:06,623
Like what?

760
01:10:06,873 --> 01:10:08,333
Don't know...

761
01:10:09,292 --> 01:10:10,960
...like Heaven or Hell.

762
01:10:11,127 --> 01:10:13,588
Fuck no, it's all made up

763
01:10:13,713 --> 01:10:15,465
to scare the shit out of us.

764
01:10:16,716 --> 01:10:18,843
We're still in Matrix.

765
01:10:25,308 --> 01:10:27,602
Once, the fucking Jehovas

766
01:10:28,478 --> 01:10:33,650
came talking about heaven,
where all live

767
01:10:34,150 --> 01:10:35,694
with peace and love.

768
01:10:36,403 --> 01:10:38,029
You mean men and women?

769
01:10:38,738 --> 01:10:41,908
Don't know, they gave me brochures.
I never read'em.

770
01:10:42,659 --> 01:10:45,912
Might be quite cool.

771
01:10:47,330 --> 01:10:49,499
Fuck them,
bunch of stoned hippies.

772
01:10:52,085 --> 01:10:53,545
You've seen "Hair", haven't ya?

773
01:10:58,091 --> 01:11:02,387
- World's a great place, anyway.
- Well...

774
01:11:06,266 --> 01:11:08,018
Dude, turn it off,

775
01:11:08,101 --> 01:11:10,145
let's be fucking enviromental.

776
01:11:42,218 --> 01:11:44,554
It's been a while
since last time, man.

777
01:11:45,055 --> 01:11:47,682
Hope that big-titted
grifter's still here.

778
01:11:48,058 --> 01:11:50,352
I really need to go.

779
01:11:50,977 --> 01:11:52,520
Where?

780
01:11:54,814 --> 01:11:57,859
If only for this day,

781
01:11:58,651 --> 01:12:00,904
life's worth living...

782
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:05,700
If only for this day...

783
01:12:12,916 --> 01:12:17,003
We'll be there in no time.

784
01:12:17,879 --> 01:12:19,464
No jo, no.

785
01:12:20,423 --> 01:12:23,134
She could come topless, eh?

786
01:12:29,015 --> 01:12:31,142
Fuck me.

787
01:12:34,354 --> 01:12:38,024
Hello, three tequilas, please.

788
01:12:46,199 --> 01:12:47,742
Ok, tres tequilas.

789
01:12:49,119 --> 01:12:51,579
Hombre.

790
01:12:54,708 --> 01:12:56,167
Por favor.

791
01:13:44,674 --> 01:13:49,262
Folklore, man...
- Hey, Meesus, you all alone?

792
01:13:49,721 --> 01:13:51,514
Come along.

793
01:13:51,931 --> 01:13:56,978
We're bigger fish
than those guys, senorita,

794
01:13:57,103 --> 01:13:59,147
and we smell better.

795
01:13:59,647 --> 01:14:02,776
Do ya wanna get

796
01:14:03,276 --> 01:14:04,819
your hooks in us?

797
01:14:04,944 --> 01:14:07,322
Dudes, fuck that. She's done,

798
01:14:08,198 --> 01:14:11,117
I don't think
she'd like to play.

799
01:14:11,284 --> 01:14:12,911
She says she's bored of you.

800
01:14:13,286 --> 01:14:15,288
She's coming with us

801
01:14:15,455 --> 01:14:17,832
and you little farts, you're
getting smacked in the head.

802
01:14:18,291 --> 01:14:19,751
Fuck it.

803
01:14:23,380 --> 01:14:25,590
What? Did you shit your pants?

804
01:14:25,674 --> 01:14:28,927
I kill you with my eyes closed.

805
01:14:29,469 --> 01:14:30,970
Try me.

806
01:14:31,137 --> 01:14:33,223
I'm gonna blow
your fucking guts out,

807
01:14:33,473 --> 01:14:35,975
until you bleed to death.

808
01:14:38,561 --> 01:14:40,647
Man you wanna try my girl, man,
fucking now, man?

809
01:14:40,772 --> 01:14:45,902
Why me?
It sucks to have lame friends.

810
01:14:47,070 --> 01:14:51,741
We could've played
as normal freaks do!

811
01:14:58,832 --> 01:15:00,375
Chickenshits!

812
01:15:01,126 --> 01:15:02,627
Cool, man,

813
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:05,463
I almost fucking believed you.

814
01:15:05,922 --> 01:15:08,591
Let's get outta here.

815
01:15:09,342 --> 01:15:11,344
This isn't all that cool,

816
01:15:12,345 --> 01:15:14,139
'cause if so,

817
01:15:14,597 --> 01:15:17,350
then who's on first base?

818
01:15:24,858 --> 01:15:26,234
- Fucking cool, eh?
- Shit yeah.

819
01:15:26,359 --> 01:15:30,238
You perverted psycho,
for fuck's sake, gimme the gun.

820
01:15:30,321 --> 01:15:32,907
Stop pointing it at me.

821
01:15:33,033 --> 01:15:35,035
It was cool, man.

822
01:15:35,201 --> 01:15:37,245
You think you live

823
01:15:37,370 --> 01:15:39,164
in a gangsta film,

824
01:15:39,456 --> 01:15:42,792
fucking tough Macho Massimo,
Desperado.

825
01:15:43,209 --> 01:15:45,420
I guess you'd like to kill

826
01:15:45,545 --> 01:15:47,756
and then shag the whole city.

827
01:15:47,881 --> 01:15:49,674
Chill, man, it fuckin' worked.

828
01:15:49,799 --> 01:15:51,843
Now you take his fucking side.

829
01:15:52,135 --> 01:15:54,804
If this dork had a machine gun,

830
01:15:54,888 --> 01:15:56,723
he'd shoot anything that moves.

831
01:15:57,140 --> 01:15:59,809
Where's that bitch?
You're late.

832
01:16:01,728 --> 01:16:06,608
I had to take care
of some old business.

833
01:16:07,150 --> 01:16:08,651
What d'ya mean?

834
01:16:08,735 --> 01:16:11,821
- Don't worry, now we're even.

835
01:16:12,322 --> 01:16:14,532
Stop fucking depressing me, man,

836
01:16:14,616 --> 01:16:17,786
and roll up a joint or what?
Shut up and drive,

837
01:16:30,298 --> 01:16:31,841
for christ's sake.

838
01:16:31,925 --> 01:16:34,636
Hit the road, baby, anyways,
you ain't never gonna forget me.

839
01:16:37,013 --> 01:16:39,015
Not much of a talker, are ya?

840
01:16:39,849 --> 01:16:42,352
It's not my fault
you haven't seen it.

841
01:16:43,269 --> 01:16:45,313
I have a tape,

842
01:16:45,397 --> 01:16:47,565
if you're interested.
Ren and Stimpy.

843
01:16:48,441 --> 01:16:51,736
Cool guys.
Once, Ren had a big long booger.

844
01:16:52,153 --> 01:16:54,072
Once, Ren had a big long booger.

845
01:16:55,824 --> 01:16:58,785
Stimpy thinks
its a cucumber salad,

846
01:16:58,910 --> 01:17:00,370
What will he do?
What will he do?

847
01:17:00,495 --> 01:17:04,165
Eats it and Stimpy's brain
just falls out of his nostrils.

848
01:17:25,645 --> 01:17:27,188
Weird smell,

849
01:17:28,148 --> 01:17:29,691
it's those fucking cows.

850
01:17:31,818 --> 01:17:33,737
Not much of a talker, are ya?

851
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:40,493
Why you after them, bro?

852
01:17:41,703 --> 01:17:43,371
Wanna tell me?

853
01:17:44,664 --> 01:17:46,499
I'm no bro of yours.

854
01:17:47,250 --> 01:17:49,002
Sorry, man just call ourselves

855
01:17:49,085 --> 01:17:50,795
blood brothers then.

856
01:17:52,005 --> 01:17:55,091
So yer a tough guy, right? Like
Clint Eastwood and those guys.

857
01:17:57,844 --> 01:18:01,639
They owe you, I owe them.

858
01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:04,934
Life's fucked up.

859
01:18:05,101 --> 01:18:06,728
Cool, Armano.

860
01:18:07,187 --> 01:18:09,522
Give me the money and

861
01:18:09,606 --> 01:18:11,608
we'll call tho whole thing off.

862
01:18:13,109 --> 01:18:15,528
I don't think you'd want that.

863
01:18:18,114 --> 01:18:21,159
Awful smell,
like a rotting fish.

864
01:18:22,535 --> 01:18:24,079
Where's it coming from?

865
01:18:27,624 --> 01:18:30,919
- I figure I stepped in some shit.
- What?

866
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:36,841
- Might mean good luck.
- Fuck that, man,

867
01:18:37,133 --> 01:18:41,096
you get in this car
with shit on your shoes.

868
01:18:41,304 --> 01:18:43,056
Fuck you,

869
01:18:43,181 --> 01:18:45,642
8 grand just for the rugs,

870
01:18:46,142 --> 01:18:48,812
no shit, man.

871
01:18:48,978 --> 01:18:51,314
D'ya think I'm some kinda a

872
01:18:51,398 --> 01:18:53,358
rock star to buy rugs like that?

873
01:18:53,483 --> 01:18:55,819
But I got'em from some Indian

874
01:18:55,902 --> 01:18:59,406
dude on teleshopping.

875
01:18:59,489 --> 01:19:01,241

This is starting to piss me off!

876
01:19:01,491 --> 01:19:04,244
Ya know, I've fucking had it,

878
01:19:06,830 --> 01:19:08,456
You fucked up my rug,

879
01:19:08,581 --> 01:19:10,375

880
01:19:11,001 --> 01:19:13,211
Just piss off, will ya?

881
01:19:17,132 --> 01:19:18,675

Just chill out and help me.

883
01:19:42,115 --> 01:19:44,367
You must be kidding.

884
01:19:44,617 --> 01:19:47,037
So you won't help me?

885
01:19:47,203 --> 01:19:48,413
Adela, you...?

886
01:19:48,538 --> 01:19:50,081
No.

887
01:19:50,206 --> 01:19:52,625
- He really wants to drown her.
- Fucking asshole.

888
01:19:52,792 --> 01:19:55,045
Got a better idea?

889
01:19:55,795 --> 01:19:57,464
You're really
fucking it up for us.

890
01:19:57,547 --> 01:19:58,548
Shut up!

891
01:19:58,715 --> 01:20:00,800
- Shit, that's not my fault.
- Shit.

892
01:20:00,884 --> 01:20:02,677
Shit, so it's
a fucking full moon.

893
01:20:04,304 --> 01:20:05,805
Low tide.

894
01:20:06,473 --> 01:20:08,683
I should've called the cops

895
01:20:08,767 --> 01:20:12,103
and gone golfing.
- Fuck it, man, I need to piss.

896
01:20:12,562 --> 01:20:15,148
- Can I watch?
- Come on, for fuck's sake.

897
01:20:36,169 --> 01:20:37,170
Shit.

898
01:20:44,427 --> 01:20:47,931
- 300 kms left.
- 500, to be exact.

899
01:20:49,099 --> 01:20:51,518
Cops would at least
give us a ride.

900
01:20:51,601 --> 01:20:54,270
It wasn't such a big fuckup,
was it?

901
01:20:54,854 --> 01:20:56,981
Be glad it's over,

902
01:20:57,941 --> 01:21:00,026
it was actually a nice trip.

903
01:21:02,946 --> 01:21:06,116
We could start hitching.

904
01:21:06,199 --> 01:21:08,243
As if someone's gonna stop
for the four of us.

905
01:21:11,454 --> 01:21:13,540
Look, you fuck.

906
01:21:13,623 --> 01:21:15,834
Cool. Let's go.

907
01:21:38,898 --> 01:21:41,109
Can we get in?

908
01:21:41,818 --> 01:21:44,529
We thought no one'd stop.

909
01:21:47,741 --> 01:21:49,743
Someone stole our car.

910
01:23:08,822 --> 01:23:11,241
This world's a weird place.

911
01:23:13,076 --> 01:23:15,620
- Are those robins?
- Where?

912
01:23:16,413 --> 01:23:17,997
Those are vultures.

913
01:23:18,415 --> 01:23:19,874
Something stinks in here.

914
01:23:20,625 --> 01:23:23,169
Written and directed by

915
01:23:24,921 --> 01:23:27,465
Director of Photography

916
01:23:29,092 --> 01:23:30,760
Wassup now?

917
01:23:30,844 --> 01:23:32,345
Well, well...

918
01:23:32,595 --> 01:23:35,098
We're going to heaven...

919
01:23:37,350 --> 01:23:40,061
It's so romantic, Karel.

920
01:23:40,770 --> 01:23:43,064
So now we're fucking angels,
right?

921
01:23:44,441 --> 01:23:46,526
I wanna be Batman.

922
01:23:47,110 --> 01:23:50,989
This is gonna
cost you a fortune.

923
01:23:51,448 --> 01:23:52,949
Right.

924
01:23:53,366 --> 01:23:55,744
- Who's paying for that pizza?
- You shut up.

925
01:23:55,952 --> 01:23:58,830
When we get there,
I get my dosh, right?

926
01:23:59,789 --> 01:24:02,959
We're gonna help
people in need.

927
01:24:03,293 --> 01:24:07,839
I don't think so,

928
01:24:08,298 --> 01:24:13,303
you're staying indefinitely.

929
01:24:14,471 --> 01:24:18,391
Excuse me, what about my house?

930
01:24:19,059 --> 01:24:21,102
I have stuff to do,

931
01:24:21,519 --> 01:24:24,689
and strawberry pudding.

932
01:24:25,398 --> 01:24:28,234
How long exactly
are we here for?

933
01:24:29,319 --> 01:24:32,072
- Forever.
- That's not fair.

934
01:24:33,031 --> 01:24:37,577
I decide

935
01:24:38,078 --> 01:24:41,790
what's fair.

936
01:24:46,628 --> 01:24:49,255
That wasn't part of the deal.
