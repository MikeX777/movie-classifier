1
00:01:43,543 --> 00:01:46,675
- Can I look in your cases?
- I've been through the scanner.

2
00:01:46,838 --> 00:01:49,222
Are you challenging me?
Come on!

3
00:02:00,768 --> 00:02:02,394
Have we met in Saint-Germain?

4
00:02:02,562 --> 00:02:04,697
They're all thieves there.

5
00:02:05,064 --> 00:02:05,907
OK?

6
00:02:06,107 --> 00:02:09,286
And you're a good girl.

7
00:02:22,206 --> 00:02:23,808
I'l doit.

8
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,002
Go into the airport.
I spotted a girl inside.

9
00:02:27,128 --> 00:02:29,513
- Inside?
- In Customs.

10
00:02:29,672 --> 00:02:32,436
She's wearing a uniform.

11
00:02:32,592 --> 00:02:34,145
Ask for her number.

12
00:02:37,055 --> 00:02:38,478
Have you put on weight?

13
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,980
People say I have,
but I can't see it.

14
00:02:44,687 --> 00:02:46,158
I can!

15
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,614
That's enough!

16
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,372
- Have you found it?
- It?

17
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:53,076
The rare bird.

18
00:02:53,279 --> 00:02:55,450
No, I haven't found it.

19
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,501
You've put on weight
because you haven't looked.

20
00:02:59,702 --> 00:03:03,677
I have looked, José,
but I don't have your eye.

21
00:03:03,831 --> 00:03:05,766
No, you don't.

22
00:03:05,917 --> 00:03:09,168
- Maybe there are none left.
- Maybe...

23
00:03:09,337 --> 00:03:10,429
You've nabbed them.

24
00:03:10,671 --> 00:03:11,846
What about girls?

25
00:03:12,048 --> 00:03:14,385
Stop it, José!

26
00:03:14,509 --> 00:03:16,977
An old elephant like you
can find water.

27
00:03:17,178 --> 00:03:19,812
I can find water, with my trunk!

28
00:03:34,696 --> 00:03:36,498
Enjoy your stay.

29
00:03:36,656 --> 00:03:38,708
You're in room 1104,
11th floor.

30
00:03:38,866 --> 00:03:40,503
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

31
00:03:43,204 --> 00:03:44,545
Mr Stockman...

32
00:03:46,499 --> 00:03:48,504
This is my son, Drissa.

33
00:03:48,668 --> 00:03:49,890
What do you want?

34
00:03:50,086 --> 00:03:52,221
I want you to take my son.

35
00:03:53,172 --> 00:03:56,885
- To Europe, to play football.
- No. I'm tired.

36
00:03:57,009 --> 00:03:58,944
He's a great footballer.

37
00:03:59,137 --> 00:04:01,817
Everyone says so.

38
00:04:01,973 --> 00:04:03,563
Take him to Europe.

39
00:04:03,725 --> 00:04:06,026
I understand, but I'm tired.

40
00:04:06,185 --> 00:04:07,324
Goodbye!

41
00:04:19,866 --> 00:04:21,705
I told you I arrived yesterday.

42
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:24,531
I said I'd call you.

43
00:04:24,662 --> 00:04:26,798
Gigi, I promised I'd call you.

44
00:04:27,623 --> 00:04:30,507
I was going to call you.
You know me...

45
00:04:32,086 --> 00:04:34,174
I'm speaking quietly
because I'm in a meeting.

46
00:04:34,297 --> 00:04:36,218
I'm working.

47
00:04:37,091 --> 00:04:39,262
I have to go. Yes.

48
00:04:39,427 --> 00:04:40,554
I'l call you back.

49
00:04:42,847 --> 00:04:44,982
- Mr Stockman?
- Just a moment.

50
00:04:45,141 --> 00:04:46,233
Someone to see you.

51
00:04:52,523 --> 00:04:53,686
You again?

52
00:04:54,692 --> 00:04:58,820
I forgot to give you this.
My son is in the paper.

53
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,826
You came back to give me this?

54
00:05:03,034 --> 00:05:05,537
I slept outside the hotel.

55
00:05:05,703 --> 00:05:07,874
- You slept outside?
- Yes.

56
00:05:08,998 --> 00:05:10,220
You're
Cr:
az
yl

57
00:05:12,418 --> 00:05:14,293
I don't listen to other people.

58
00:05:15,338 --> 00:05:16,263
Sorry.

59
00:05:21,803 --> 00:05:24,009
- What's his name?
- Drissa.

60
00:05:24,263 --> 00:05:25,984
- Where is he?
- Down there.

61
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,940
Underneath my balcony?

62
00:05:30,895 --> 00:05:35,949
Go on! Play for the white man!

63
00:05:46,285 --> 00:05:47,210
Fine...

64
00:05:48,121 --> 00:05:49,082
Off you go...

65
00:05:50,415 --> 00:05:53,629
You should try the circus.

66
00:05:53,751 --> 00:05:55,139
He's like a sea lion.

67
00:05:59,257 --> 00:06:02,638
A piece of wood that floats
will never be a caiman.

68
00:06:02,802 --> 00:06:04,522
Do you understand?

69
00:06:09,434 --> 00:06:10,857
Leaving already?

70
00:06:11,769 --> 00:06:12,943
I'm going right now.

71
00:06:13,104 --> 00:06:14,326
Wait a minute.

72
00:06:14,522 --> 00:06:17,986
I might have something else
to declare.

73
00:06:18,109 --> 00:06:20,624
I'l give you some money
for a taxi.

74
00:06:27,201 --> 00:06:30,962
We've been trying to get
a meeting for a year.

75
00:06:31,122 --> 00:06:33,056
That's the Stockman effect.

76
00:06:39,338 --> 00:06:42,648
We need to play this subtly.

77
00:06:44,343 --> 00:06:46,183
Subtlety is my middle name.

78
00:06:51,559 --> 00:06:53,362
Put your case on your head.

79
00:06:53,561 --> 00:06:54,735
Your case.

80
00:06:56,022 --> 00:06:57,694
Put your briefcase on your head.

81
00:07:07,617 --> 00:07:08,708
You're a good pilot!

82
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,286
Boubacar at Anderlecht,
was that you?

83
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:11,909
Indeed.

84
00:07:12,038 --> 00:07:14,090
And Matute at Newcastle?

85
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:15,120
Yes.

86
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:17,290
Eboué, at Arsenal?

87
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:21,221
You're very good, Mr Stockman.
What's your secret?

88
00:07:24,258 --> 00:07:25,302
May I?

89
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,855
I have a big nose!

90
00:07:31,808 --> 00:07:32,851
I have a nose for it.

91
00:07:35,061 --> 00:07:37,611
What do you think of Mr Costa,
our coach?

92
00:07:37,814 --> 00:07:40,115
Honestly? Can I be honest?

93
00:07:41,401 --> 00:07:43,192
He's an idiot.

94
00:07:44,529 --> 00:07:46,581
The match against Cameroon.

95
00:07:46,698 --> 00:07:50,505
He takes Boka off after 10 minutes
for a poor dribble.

96
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:53,210
He should never
have taken him off.

97
00:07:53,454 --> 00:07:57,582
He should have let him
carry on playing.

98
00:07:58,459 --> 00:08:01,722
If he wants to be Teutonic,
he should go to Germany!

99
00:08:02,255 --> 00:08:04,307
They'll play in Lederhosen!

100
00:08:04,424 --> 00:08:06,974
- Sorry, it's my sense of humour.
- I agree.

101
00:08:07,593 --> 00:08:09,599
You're a visionary.
I'l hire you.

102
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,110
To do what?

103
00:08:14,267 --> 00:08:16,533
This is a talented generation.

104
00:08:17,145 --> 00:08:19,862
We need the right coach
to find them.

105
00:08:20,523 --> 00:08:21,697
Come closer.

106
00:08:23,026 --> 00:08:25,611
Ivory Coast will win the World Cup.

107
00:08:28,364 --> 00:08:30,298
They've been saying that
for 30 years.

108
00:08:30,533 --> 00:08:32,538
"Africa is the future for football."

109
00:08:32,702 --> 00:08:35,336
Africa will never win the World Cup.

110
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,541
Why not?

111
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:40,713
Look at the 2002 World Cup.

112
00:08:41,294 --> 00:08:44,603
Senegal won the opening match

113
00:08:44,797 --> 00:08:46,968
against the world champions,
France.

114
00:08:47,175 --> 00:08:48,765
It was a great match.

115
00:08:49,677 --> 00:08:53,853
But did they go back
to the hotel to rest? No.

116
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:57,953
They went back to the hotel,
with some girls.

117
00:08:58,102 --> 00:09:01,365
They got drunk and spent 3 days...

118
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:05,073
Did they get to the final?
No.

119
00:09:05,193 --> 00:09:09,570
The players could hardly
open their eyes on the bus.

120
00:09:09,781 --> 00:09:11,750
"I regret it now!"

121
00:09:13,659 --> 00:09:17,006
- Could you go a month without...?
- Get out.

122
00:09:18,831 --> 00:09:20,955
Minister,
I have the agreement...

123
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,418
I said: "Get out!"

124
00:09:30,968 --> 00:09:32,179
What did I say?

125
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:41,863
Wake up!

126
00:09:42,647 --> 00:09:44,782
Look at him, look at him...

127
00:09:44,941 --> 00:09:47,028
He's apologizing for being alive!

128
00:09:47,276 --> 00:09:48,154
H
[
s
asleep!

129
00:09:48,319 --> 00:09:50,739
The last time,
what did I ask for?

130
00:09:50,863 --> 00:09:53,592
- A killer.
- "A killer." And is he?

131
00:09:53,741 --> 00:09:54,750
No.

132
00:09:55,743 --> 00:09:57,677
I wanted a son of a bitch.

133
00:09:57,912 --> 00:10:00,676
A guy with zero IQ.

134
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:03,590
If he stops to think, it's no good.

135
00:10:03,751 --> 00:10:05,210
That's what he does.

136
00:10:05,461 --> 00:10:07,917
OK?
Do you need a rest?

137
00:10:09,507 --> 00:10:11,346
He's scared of the ball!
What's his name?

138
00:10:11,509 --> 00:10:13,431
- Dramon.
- Dramon! You call him!

139
00:10:14,303 --> 00:10:16,474
Dramon, come here!

140
00:10:16,597 --> 00:10:19,492
Kick the ball
only if there's an opening.

141
00:10:19,684 --> 00:10:22,270
The ball isn't on fire.
Don't be scared of it.

142
00:10:23,646 --> 00:10:25,947
Go on! Go for the ball!

143
00:10:27,859 --> 00:10:30,908
You told them playing football
would make them rich.

144
00:10:31,112 --> 00:10:34,493
It's not true.
Only Salif has become rich.

145
00:10:34,657 --> 00:10:36,828
And the other kids
who do nothing...

146
00:10:37,452 --> 00:10:38,757
They're struggling.

147
00:10:42,165 --> 00:10:45,546
Salif supports a whole village.

148
00:10:45,668 --> 00:10:47,875
Not like other kids.

149
00:10:48,046 --> 00:10:50,216
Hold on! Salif,

150
00:10:50,423 --> 00:10:54,017
1 kid out of 1,000 in the village
who succeeds.

151
00:10:54,177 --> 00:10:55,719
One kid: Salif!

152
00:10:55,887 --> 00:10:58,639
One kid.
Better than nothing.

153
00:10:58,765 --> 00:11:02,158
- And the others?
- That's the law, Bibo.

154
00:11:09,442 --> 00:11:12,076
That was hardly football.

155
00:11:12,195 --> 00:11:13,867
Hardly football.

156
00:11:14,947 --> 00:11:17,249
You weren't playing.
You were trotting.

157
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,832
Have you concrete feet?

158
00:11:20,995 --> 00:11:23,000
- My feet hurt.
- Your feet hurt?

159
00:11:23,164 --> 00:11:25,299
What do you want?

160
00:11:26,876 --> 00:11:29,474
Should I stop spending
a week each month

161
00:11:29,629 --> 00:11:31,753
watching you play?

162
00:11:31,923 --> 00:11:34,259
Shall I stop wasting my money?

163
00:11:34,467 --> 00:11:35,772
Stop believing in you?

164
00:11:35,927 --> 00:11:38,608
I believe in you.
You don't believe in yourselves.

165
00:11:45,686 --> 00:11:47,277
I'd rather go back.

166
00:11:57,615 --> 00:11:58,837
Mr José...

167
00:12:00,535 --> 00:12:01,757
Calm down.

168
00:12:01,953 --> 00:12:04,159
I understand.
I know them.

169
00:12:04,288 --> 00:12:06,009
They'll rally.

170
00:12:06,165 --> 00:12:09,511
They'll work.
They'll do better.

171
00:12:10,586 --> 00:12:11,749
They'll do better.

172
00:12:13,798 --> 00:12:14,937
Children...

173
00:12:17,343 --> 00:12:20,131
I'd like you to feel guilty
of underachieving.

174
00:12:23,975 --> 00:12:25,481
Back on the pitch.

175
00:12:26,811 --> 00:12:27,689
Coach!

176
00:12:28,438 --> 00:12:30,075
Let me play?

177
00:12:31,816 --> 00:12:34,153
- Who is this?
- I don't know him.

178
00:12:34,277 --> 00:12:35,700
He's not local.

179
00:12:37,697 --> 00:12:38,539
You want to play?

180
00:12:39,657 --> 00:12:40,547
In those shoes?

181
00:12:41,576 --> 00:12:42,655
I know him.

182
00:12:43,786 --> 00:12:45,838
Get lost.
We don't want gangs here.

183
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:48,174
Come here and say that.

184
00:12:50,376 --> 00:12:51,871
Don't bother.

185
00:12:53,254 --> 00:12:54,999
Back to the game.

186
00:12:56,466 --> 00:12:57,390
Goon!

187
00:12:58,259 --> 00:12:59,600
Go away.

188
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:49,782
Is this it?

189
00:13:51,104 --> 00:13:52,480
I think so.

190
00:13:52,647 --> 00:13:54,154
He plays here every night.

191
00:13:54,357 --> 00:13:57,536
That's him.
In the Brazil shirt.

192
00:14:21,175 --> 00:14:22,896
He's got something.

193
00:14:25,346 --> 00:14:27,102
Go and get him.

194
00:14:46,993 --> 00:14:48,665
You're not bad.

195
00:14:49,328 --> 00:14:51,120
- What's your name?
- Koné Yaya.

196
00:14:52,331 --> 00:14:54,419
- How old are you?
-19.

197
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:57,259
19 and the rest!

198
00:14:58,046 --> 00:14:59,386
You can't kid me.

199
00:14:59,589 --> 00:15:01,261
Anyway...

200
00:15:01,382 --> 00:15:03,185
Even if you're 25,

201
00:15:03,342 --> 00:15:06,272
I guarantee I can get you playing
in the Champions League.

202
00:15:06,888 --> 00:15:07,931
Here.

203
00:15:11,601 --> 00:15:14,863
10am at the Bibo ground.
Know where it is?

204
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:18,233
Think about it.

205
00:15:19,067 --> 00:15:20,324
When you're old...

206
00:15:21,027 --> 00:15:24,373
They'll say: "That guy
crossing the road. It's Yayal

207
00:15:24,614 --> 00:15:26,535
"He was in the final
against Barcelona."

208
00:15:26,657 --> 00:15:28,283
When I'm old,

209
00:15:28,451 --> 00:15:31,500
they'll ask how I managed
to buy such a nice house.

210
00:15:31,704 --> 00:15:32,783
Yes.

211
00:15:33,498 --> 00:15:34,506
That too.

212
00:15:39,921 --> 00:15:40,882
I suggest

213
00:15:41,047 --> 00:15:43,348
you send over
one of your scouts, OK?

214
00:15:43,508 --> 00:15:47,090
So he can see for himself.
Just watch him play.

215
00:15:47,261 --> 00:15:49,148
I'l pay the costs.

216
00:15:50,014 --> 00:15:51,948
You'll see, he's a rocket.

217
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,148
He just needs a launch pad.

218
00:15:58,439 --> 00:15:59,946
OK. I'll call you tomorrow.

219
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,408
Thanks.

220
00:16:02,485 --> 00:16:05,285
- Hello, precious.
- Hello, darling.

221
00:16:08,783 --> 00:16:11,168
- You get more beautiful.
- Thank you.

222
00:16:11,369 --> 00:16:14,169
- Oh my, oh my...
- It's for you.

223
00:16:15,957 --> 00:16:16,787
Have you decided?

224
00:16:18,793 --> 00:16:22,126
Yes. I'll have steak tartare
without capers.

225
00:16:22,797 --> 00:16:24,138
And some pinot noir.

226
00:16:24,966 --> 00:16:25,891
I haven't.

227
00:16:28,845 --> 00:16:31,229
- When was the fish caught?
- Today.

228
00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:33,809
- It's fresh?
- Of course.

229
00:16:39,063 --> 00:16:40,285
I'm undecided.

230
00:16:41,482 --> 00:16:44,068
This might help.
That was the wine list.

231
00:16:50,033 --> 00:16:51,444
- Grilled chicken.
- OK.

232
00:16:57,248 --> 00:17:00,178
Why didn't you tell me?

233
00:17:01,586 --> 00:17:02,475
You'd seen.

234
00:17:04,088 --> 00:17:07,267
- All part of your charm.
- Crap, José!

235
00:17:07,425 --> 00:17:09,228
Everyone can read in Belgium.

236
00:17:11,304 --> 00:17:12,265
She thinks she's clever.

237
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:16,024
Working 12 hours a day
for 1,200 F...

238
00:17:16,225 --> 00:17:18,361
She looks like a penguin.

239
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,442
That's why she doesn't like you.

240
00:17:22,106 --> 00:17:22,949
If she knew...

241
00:17:23,191 --> 00:17:25,326
- What?
- She thinks you're paying me.

242
00:17:26,944 --> 00:17:28,463
You don't need me.

243
00:17:31,324 --> 00:17:32,949
I know that look.

244
00:17:35,078 --> 00:17:36,750
"Why don't you give me money?"

245
00:17:38,122 --> 00:17:39,795
You think I'm made of money.

246
00:17:39,999 --> 00:17:43,214
You think we're all rich in Europe.

247
00:17:43,336 --> 00:17:44,178
No.

248
00:17:45,088 --> 00:17:46,262
I think I'm pregnant.

249
00:17:47,006 --> 00:17:48,347
- Who's the father?
- You.

250
00:17:48,508 --> 00:17:50,643
Me? I doubt that.

251
00:17:50,885 --> 00:17:52,890
Remember Grand-Bassam?

252
00:17:53,012 --> 00:17:55,183
The condom broke.

253
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:57,276
You think it's mine?

254
00:17:57,433 --> 00:17:59,770
I'm not the only visitor!

255
00:18:00,937 --> 00:18:02,728
Did the sperm have a moustache?

256
00:18:03,147 --> 00:18:05,164
- Hi, José!
- Is that it?

257
00:18:05,358 --> 00:18:07,897
- José, is that it?
- Calm down.

258
00:18:08,111 --> 00:18:09,867
- Precious...
- You annoy me.

259
00:18:17,078 --> 00:18:19,048
Gigi! Gigi!

260
00:18:19,163 --> 00:18:20,207
Forgive me.

261
00:18:36,139 --> 00:18:37,859
He's a war machine.

262
00:18:37,974 --> 00:18:40,109
The best scout in Belgium.

263
00:18:40,268 --> 00:18:42,189
That's why they're sending him.

264
00:18:43,896 --> 00:18:44,905
That's him.

265
00:18:45,523 --> 00:18:47,504
They'll take everything.

266
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:52,157
Come on.

267
00:19:08,171 --> 00:19:09,843
Where is this black pearl?

268
00:19:10,673 --> 00:19:11,563
In a safe place.

269
00:19:11,758 --> 00:19:14,806
- No-one knows about him?
- No.

270
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:18,350
He plays in a rough neighbourhood,
at night.

271
00:19:18,556 --> 00:19:21,024
- At night?
- Most play at night.

272
00:19:21,142 --> 00:19:22,186
They have to work.

273
00:19:22,643 --> 00:19:24,814
They work in the day
and play at night.

274
00:19:24,979 --> 00:19:27,280
That's their strength...

275
00:19:27,982 --> 00:19:30,070
They sense their opponents.

276
00:19:30,318 --> 00:19:33,532
They have a sixth sense.

277
00:19:33,654 --> 00:19:35,245
It's incredible.

278
00:19:35,448 --> 00:19:39,458
They're like lizards.
They're nyctalopic.

279
00:19:39,911 --> 00:19:41,786
- "Nyctalopic"?
- Nyctalopic.

280
00:19:43,164 --> 00:19:44,754
They can see in the dark.

281
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:48,214
- That's their strength.
- Really?

282
00:19:48,336 --> 00:19:49,297
Lizards are nyctalopic.

283
00:19:49,921 --> 00:19:52,720
Lizards can see in the dark
and dodge.

284
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:58,059
They dodge.
They sense the ball in the dark.

285
00:19:58,721 --> 00:20:00,857
It's a strength.
Birds aren't nyctalopic.

286
00:20:02,058 --> 00:20:03,778
- Birds?
- They go to sleep.

287
00:20:03,976 --> 00:20:06,147
Or they'd bump into things.

288
00:20:07,271 --> 00:20:08,363
No!

289
00:20:21,703 --> 00:20:23,790
Well done! Sit down, children.

290
00:20:23,996 --> 00:20:25,005
Sit down.

291
00:20:25,248 --> 00:20:27,169
That was such a pleasure.

292
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:29,385
The lovely song rising...

293
00:20:30,962 --> 00:20:32,100
That was too slow.

294
00:20:32,296 --> 00:20:36,508
We're from this association:
A pair of shoes for my African buddy.

295
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:42,063
Come on.

296
00:20:42,265 --> 00:20:44,899
Children!

297
00:20:45,017 --> 00:20:46,310
Excuse me.

298
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:49,853
- Do you really want these shoes?
- Yes!

299
00:20:50,022 --> 00:20:53,570
Why?
Who do you want to be like?

300
00:20:53,693 --> 00:20:55,615
- Aruna Dindane.
- Who?

301
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,991
- Aruna Dindane.
- He's a great player.

302
00:20:58,197 --> 00:20:59,669
A really great player.

303
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:04,082
And do you know why?

304
00:21:04,203 --> 00:21:06,125
Up until the age of 16,

305
00:21:07,206 --> 00:21:09,141
Aruna played without shoes.

306
00:21:09,751 --> 00:21:10,913
He played barefoot.

307
00:21:11,085 --> 00:21:13,517
Being barefoot is your strength.

308
00:21:13,713 --> 00:21:16,299
You feel the ball better.

309
00:21:16,716 --> 00:21:17,808
It makes you special.

310
00:21:17,967 --> 00:21:20,138
Fine!
That's your opinion.

311
00:21:20,344 --> 00:21:22,930
Let's carry on.
Come along...

312
00:21:23,097 --> 00:21:24,604
Think about it, children.

313
00:21:24,807 --> 00:21:27,014
You have to love football.

314
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:28,905
Go away, you idiot!

315
00:21:29,771 --> 00:21:32,286
The shoes are for you.

316
00:21:33,024 --> 00:21:33,854
Take them.

317
00:21:41,115 --> 00:21:43,701
Adama! I'm watching!

318
00:22:08,142 --> 00:22:10,147
- Pina colada.
- Baileys.

319
00:22:10,895 --> 00:22:12,236
Pina colada.

320
00:22:12,855 --> 00:22:14,066
Are you married?

321
00:22:14,774 --> 00:22:15,699
Married?

322
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,193
Do you have a wife?

323
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:21,204
No. I'm not married.

324
00:22:54,397 --> 00:22:57,066
When are you going back
to Belgium?

325
00:22:58,359 --> 00:23:00,162
I'm here for a week.

326
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:02,325
- Just a week?
- Yes.

327
00:23:03,114 --> 00:23:05,499
- It's a pity.
- Pity.

328
00:23:06,242 --> 00:23:09,090
I'l have to make the most of you.

329
00:23:09,245 --> 00:23:10,253
Pardon?

330
00:23:10,413 --> 00:23:13,746
- I'll have to make the most of you.
- Yes!

331
00:23:15,168 --> 00:23:17,718
I've chosen sea bass.

332
00:23:17,962 --> 00:23:20,050
Profiteroles and fish are light.

333
00:23:21,758 --> 00:23:23,348
That's not why you called.

334
00:23:27,096 --> 00:23:29,267
Hubert and I thought...

335
00:23:30,099 --> 00:23:33,101
So you won't have to meet
my parents,

336
00:23:33,227 --> 00:23:35,149
come to the church.

337
00:23:36,564 --> 00:23:38,949
You'll have drinks and all that.

338
00:23:39,108 --> 00:23:40,995
They can come to the meal.

339
00:23:41,235 --> 00:23:42,576
Hold on.

340
00:23:42,695 --> 00:23:45,661
I can't come to my son's wedding?

341
00:23:45,865 --> 00:23:47,751
You want to spend
the evening with my parents?

342
00:23:49,952 --> 00:23:51,554
No. That's what I thought.

343
00:23:51,788 --> 00:23:55,454
And you need to pay 2,000 euros.

344
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:57,001
- I sent the money.
- When?

345
00:23:57,126 --> 00:23:59,594
I did, but I'm in Africa!

346
00:23:59,796 --> 00:24:01,267
- You didn't.
- Can't hear you.

347
00:24:04,675 --> 00:24:07,393
Don't listen to her.
You're a man.

348
00:24:07,553 --> 00:24:10,139
José, you're a killer.

349
00:24:10,264 --> 00:24:12,530
Yes, I'm a killer. You're right.

350
00:24:15,728 --> 00:24:17,116
You're right.

351
00:24:19,607 --> 00:24:21,209
You have rhythm, Koen.

352
00:24:21,859 --> 00:24:24,873
When you dance,
you look like David Bowie.

353
00:24:25,071 --> 00:24:26,542
Like in Let's Dance.

354
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:28,868
It's not those legs he's using.

355
00:24:29,867 --> 00:24:31,374
It's the third leg!

356
00:24:33,496 --> 00:24:35,252
Did you see those soldiers?

357
00:24:35,456 --> 00:24:37,711
It's for security.

358
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:39,216
No. It was too much.

359
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:40,978
It's for your protection.

360
00:24:41,129 --> 00:24:42,682
I want three driers.

361
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:46,134
- For drying hair.
- OK.

362
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:49,812
There are the driers.
That's the big couch.

363
00:24:49,971 --> 00:24:53,055
- How do containers work?
- What containers?

364
00:24:53,266 --> 00:24:56,659
She wants to order special sinks
for washing hair.

365
00:24:57,603 --> 00:24:58,612
"Special sinks"?

366
00:24:58,813 --> 00:25:02,396
Yes. Professional stuff
for her salon.

367
00:25:02,525 --> 00:25:05,574
With integral shower heads.

368
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,988
Can we forget about sinks
and containers

369
00:25:09,115 --> 00:25:11,535
and concentrate?

370
00:25:11,701 --> 00:25:13,006
We've a match in an hour.

371
00:25:13,202 --> 00:25:17,094
Go without me.
I trust you.

372
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:22,219
Girls, take a walk.

373
00:25:28,217 --> 00:25:29,261
But...

374
00:25:29,969 --> 00:25:33,351
Are you OK?
You can't talk to them like that.

375
00:25:33,556 --> 00:25:34,719
Koen...

376
00:25:35,683 --> 00:25:36,645
You've flipped.

377
00:25:37,393 --> 00:25:40,572
You're buying a hair salon
for some prostitute?

378
00:25:40,813 --> 00:25:43,483
Hold on, José.
She isn't a prostitute.

379
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:46,816
Don't talk about Fleur like that.

380
00:25:47,362 --> 00:25:50,754
I love her.
And she loves me.

381
00:25:53,701 --> 00:25:54,531
Koen...

382
00:25:58,706 --> 00:25:59,714
10.

383
00:26:19,852 --> 00:26:21,904
Up! Get up!

384
00:26:22,063 --> 00:26:24,780
I came to see you.
Get up!

385
00:26:30,571 --> 00:26:31,782
Here.

386
00:26:31,906 --> 00:26:34,338
You should eat before a match.

387
00:26:35,993 --> 00:26:36,955
Eat.

388
00:26:40,206 --> 00:26:44,334
If I only send rascals to Europe,
the source will dry up.

389
00:26:44,502 --> 00:26:48,275
José told me they have problems
with Bouba and the others.

390
00:26:48,423 --> 00:26:50,593
They won't want more Africans.

391
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,402
Look at this.

392
00:26:52,552 --> 00:26:55,055
They don't like that.

393
00:26:55,179 --> 00:26:56,686
Get rid of that.

394
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:03,230
- Abdou, scrub!
- It's not going.

395
00:27:03,354 --> 00:27:06,901
It can't look like a tattoo.

396
00:27:07,066 --> 00:27:08,608
It's not going.

397
00:27:08,818 --> 00:27:10,372
Scrub like a man!

398
00:27:13,489 --> 00:27:14,795
Are you a girl?

399
00:27:20,455 --> 00:27:22,092
[t wasn't hard enough.

400
00:27:24,208 --> 00:27:25,170
Abdou!

401
00:27:25,334 --> 00:27:28,882
You're the one who should go.

402
00:27:30,381 --> 00:27:31,888
I don't want to play.

403
00:27:32,091 --> 00:27:33,717
Honour what God has given you.

404
00:27:33,968 --> 00:27:36,388
- Who will take care of Abdou?
- Me.

405
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:38,239
I'll treat him like a son.

406
00:27:49,984 --> 00:27:51,242
Hello?

407
00:27:52,236 --> 00:27:54,573
You're at the hotel?

408
00:27:54,781 --> 00:27:57,212
They won't give you the keys?

409
00:28:00,244 --> 00:28:02,843
Put him on.

410
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:06,747
Yes, sir. It's me.

411
00:28:07,794 --> 00:28:08,636
She's my girlfriend.

412
00:28:08,878 --> 00:28:10,598
Give them to her.

413
00:28:12,507 --> 00:28:14,975
Yes, love. I'm coming.

414
00:28:15,176 --> 00:28:17,513
You enjoy your bath.

415
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:18,901
Come on!

416
00:28:22,725 --> 00:28:24,078
They're damaging him.

417
00:28:27,021 --> 00:28:28,029
Mohamed...

418
00:28:30,733 --> 00:28:32,275
Why did you do that?

419
00:28:32,443 --> 00:28:33,867
That was slaughter!

420
00:28:36,155 --> 00:28:38,908
You think that
will get you to Europe?

421
00:28:40,368 --> 00:28:41,839
He's going to Europe.

422
00:28:44,205 --> 00:28:45,249
Come on.

423
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,930
It's not right to play like that.

424
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:57,861
- It's understandable, José.
- What is?

425
00:28:57,969 --> 00:29:00,852
That kid has been training
for 4 years.

426
00:29:01,013 --> 00:29:03,149
He turns up and takes his place.

427
00:29:03,391 --> 00:29:04,435
You can understand it.

428
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,353
You don't succeed
because another fails.

429
00:29:09,188 --> 00:29:11,039
Get me a cigarette.

430
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:26,036
- You don't like him?
- No.

431
00:29:26,247 --> 00:29:29,213
- Why not?
- You're not taking me to Europe.

432
00:29:34,922 --> 00:29:38,351
We should open a sandwich shop.

433
00:29:38,509 --> 00:29:39,897
Good idea.

434
00:29:40,094 --> 00:29:41,897
With my knowledge.

435
00:29:42,055 --> 00:29:45,364
We can do sandwiches

436
00:29:45,558 --> 00:29:47,990
with chicken curry, salad.

437
00:29:48,144 --> 00:29:49,947
We'll call it crab,
but use surimi.

438
00:29:50,104 --> 00:29:52,323
That will be an increase...

439
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:53,901
Excuse me.

440
00:29:56,694 --> 00:29:57,786
Yes?

441
00:29:58,029 --> 00:29:59,286
I'm busy.

442
00:30:01,741 --> 00:30:03,746
No...

443
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:06,638
It's not what you think.
It's my little sister.

444
00:30:06,788 --> 00:30:08,341
We're clothes shopping.

445
00:30:09,123 --> 00:30:11,045
I can't really talk.

446
00:30:13,419 --> 00:30:14,688
That's not true!

447
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:17,587
You've forgotten me.

448
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:19,555
I was on time.

449
00:30:20,301 --> 00:30:21,262
Ciao-ciao.

450
00:30:23,346 --> 00:30:25,185
Will we make our own bread?

451
00:30:26,516 --> 00:30:27,394
José?

452
00:30:28,309 --> 00:30:30,528
What is wrong, José?

453
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:32,621
Sir, please...

454
00:30:33,314 --> 00:30:35,533
My mobile has gone in the water.

455
00:30:35,692 --> 00:30:39,369
- I'm sick of your mobile.
- Why did you do that?

456
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:42,783
- I was sick of it.
- I can't work now.

457
00:30:42,949 --> 00:30:46,081
Good, you're here with me.

458
00:30:46,202 --> 00:30:47,590
With me.

459
00:30:47,787 --> 00:30:50,408
Have some decency.
Some morals.

460
00:30:50,581 --> 00:30:53,511
Your morality is for Whites!

461
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:54,973
When the plate is full.

462
00:30:55,169 --> 00:30:58,349
If you didn't have money,
I wouldn't sleep with you.

463
00:30:58,506 --> 00:30:59,645
You're pathetic.

464
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:01,175
You're a pathetic man.

465
00:31:01,342 --> 00:31:02,801
Just a dog!

466
00:31:03,553 --> 00:31:05,059
Filthy White!

467
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:07,149
Who pays for everything?

468
00:31:21,529 --> 00:31:22,372
Mr Stockman.

469
00:31:24,323 --> 00:31:25,961
We found him at the buffet.

470
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,916
- Is he with you?
- Yes.

471
00:31:29,078 --> 00:31:30,040
Really?

472
00:31:30,204 --> 00:31:31,510
Are you ready?

473
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:34,548
Off we go.

474
00:31:47,221 --> 00:31:49,191
- Hello!
- All right?

475
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:51,442
- What do you think?
- It's nice.

476
00:31:51,642 --> 00:31:54,063
- Great, isn't it?
- Yeah...

477
00:31:56,064 --> 00:32:00,240
You can't get on the plane
dressed like that.

478
00:32:00,401 --> 00:32:01,908
Good. I'm staying.

479
00:32:02,695 --> 00:32:03,657
Staying?

480
00:32:03,863 --> 00:32:06,331
Yes. 3 more weeks.

481
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:10,963
The container arrives in 10 days
and we open the salon in 2 weeks.

482
00:32:11,954 --> 00:32:13,093
I'm staying here.

483
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:15,673
Open the salon?

484
00:32:15,875 --> 00:32:18,141
Everything is sorted out for Yaya.

485
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:21,093
They're expecting you.

486
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:22,940
No problem!

487
00:32:26,052 --> 00:32:27,428
And your wife?

488
00:32:28,638 --> 00:32:29,776
I called her.

489
00:32:31,432 --> 00:32:32,275
She knows.

490
00:32:37,063 --> 00:32:38,071
Stay.

491
00:32:49,909 --> 00:32:51,083
I know how you feel.

492
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:54,257
You want to protect them.

493
00:32:54,455 --> 00:32:56,009
Be a hero.

494
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:58,795
You think they need you.

495
00:33:00,044 --> 00:33:03,093
The girls here,
it's like building a motorway.

496
00:33:03,297 --> 00:33:04,970
You'll never see the end of it.

497
00:33:05,758 --> 00:33:08,511
Think about it.
Come with me.

498
00:33:09,429 --> 00:33:10,271
I'm staying.

499
00:33:14,183 --> 00:33:15,180
It's your life.

500
00:33:21,858 --> 00:33:22,901
He's not coming.

501
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:28,156
Nothing worse
than a White who thinks he's Black.

502
00:33:28,322 --> 00:33:29,284
Let's go.

503
00:33:38,374 --> 00:33:39,964
Like your new outfit?

504
00:33:41,502 --> 00:33:43,305
They're your club colours.

505
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:46,761
Welcome to Charleroi Sporting Club.

506
00:33:48,176 --> 00:33:49,469
It's a good club, you'll see.

507
00:34:11,032 --> 00:34:12,883
What's all this?

508
00:34:15,161 --> 00:34:17,296
OK, let me get out.

509
00:34:17,497 --> 00:34:19,668
Leave it to me.
There's too many of them.

510
00:34:24,295 --> 00:34:25,636
Wait...

511
00:34:46,025 --> 00:34:47,746
There's no more.

512
00:34:51,572 --> 00:34:52,581
Hello.

513
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:57,132
Please follow me.

514
00:34:57,954 --> 00:34:59,674
- Follow me.
- What is it?

515
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:02,215
- Follow me.
- I've a plane to catch.

516
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:06,428
Do you know him?

517
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:12,094
- Where are you from?
- Bako.

518
00:35:12,301 --> 00:35:13,393
Ring any bells?

519
00:35:15,346 --> 00:35:17,434
- You look like a Dioula.
- I am a Dioula.

520
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,689
- And you don't know Bako?
- I came to Abidjan aged 5.

521
00:35:20,893 --> 00:35:23,230
Can we move on?
Our plane's waiting.

522
00:35:23,396 --> 00:35:25,021
He's been here for 2 days.

523
00:35:25,189 --> 00:35:27,859
- What for?
- He says he's his father.

524
00:35:28,026 --> 00:35:30,113
His name's Alassane Koné.

525
00:35:30,945 --> 00:35:32,796
- What's yours?
- Yaya.

526
00:35:32,947 --> 00:35:35,498
- Yaya what?
- Koné Yaya.

527
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:37,459
He's your father?

528
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:40,956
- Oh, Yaya, is that your father?
- No!

529
00:35:41,122 --> 00:35:44,206
I left the village at 5.
There are lots of Konés.

530
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:45,218
Yaya...

531
00:35:45,376 --> 00:35:47,049
Hamedine left Abidjan on Friday.

532
00:35:47,378 --> 00:35:50,641
He said you were going
to play in the Whites' country.

533
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,347
In a big club.

534
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:55,148
Inch Allah! We're proud of you.

535
00:35:55,344 --> 00:35:58,322
I can't give you anything now.
Only later.

536
00:35:58,514 --> 00:36:00,899
I have to do a test.

537
00:36:01,768 --> 00:36:03,524
If I pass, I'll have a contract.

538
00:36:04,604 --> 00:36:06,194
Then I'll have money.

539
00:36:07,356 --> 00:36:08,186
Money?

540
00:36:11,027 --> 00:36:14,336
You want money
now he's a heavyweight?

541
00:36:14,489 --> 00:36:17,751
You gonna find him
a bunch of fathers?

542
00:36:20,995 --> 00:36:22,490
Right now, I'm his father.

543
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:29,760
How much?

544
00:37:06,708 --> 00:37:09,673
CHARLEROI STADIUM

545
00:37:15,216 --> 00:37:16,675
You OK?

546
00:37:18,219 --> 00:37:20,189
- Sort of.
- You don't look good.

547
00:37:21,472 --> 00:37:22,551
It's malaria.

548
00:37:24,183 --> 00:37:25,524
Shit...

549
00:37:26,394 --> 00:37:29,063
The day of the test?
Unbelievable!

550
00:37:29,814 --> 00:37:31,025
I don't believe it!

551
00:37:32,525 --> 00:37:33,866
Get me some medicine.

552
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,033
Don't worry, I will.

553
00:37:37,196 --> 00:37:39,201
Oh, no, not him! Shit...

554
00:37:39,365 --> 00:37:40,373
Be right back.

555
00:37:42,493 --> 00:37:43,917
Dr Livingstone, I presume!

556
00:37:44,078 --> 00:37:46,035
Hey, the Mourinho of Africa!

557
00:37:46,205 --> 00:37:48,460
Did you get your end away?

558
00:37:48,624 --> 00:37:49,763
How are you?

559
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:53,556
- You're saving the season.
- I'm saving your club.

560
00:37:53,713 --> 00:37:55,919
Got your golden boy?
Where is he?

561
00:37:58,968 --> 00:37:59,846
There.

562
00:38:01,763 --> 00:38:03,269
- Him?
- Yeah.

563
00:38:03,431 --> 00:38:05,187
Why's he in the car?

564
00:38:05,391 --> 00:38:07,823
He's suffering from jet lag.

565
00:38:10,063 --> 00:38:13,657
Jet lag?
Abidjan to Brussels, that's...

566
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,995
An hour. An hour and a bit.

567
00:38:18,613 --> 00:38:20,072
It's longer for them.

568
00:38:22,742 --> 00:38:25,411
He's no good.
I can't use him.

569
00:38:25,578 --> 00:38:28,010
Give me 30 minutes!

570
00:38:28,206 --> 00:38:29,831
Just 30 minutes, OK?

571
00:38:30,583 --> 00:38:31,959
He's a rocket!

572
00:38:43,012 --> 00:38:44,056
Hi, Son.

573
00:38:44,263 --> 00:38:46,778
- What do you want?
- I was passing...

574
00:38:48,393 --> 00:38:49,270
Hello, madam.

575
00:38:50,478 --> 00:38:51,570
Classy!

576
00:38:53,272 --> 00:38:54,613
Nice place!

577
00:38:54,774 --> 00:38:56,791
All this equipment...

578
00:38:57,819 --> 00:38:59,954
- Good quality.
- What do you want?

579
00:39:02,407 --> 00:39:05,574
Give the kid a shot.
He's got malaria.

580
00:39:05,785 --> 00:39:07,256
He's from Cote d'Ivoire.

581
00:39:07,412 --> 00:39:09,582
He's got a chance to play here.

582
00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:12,880
His test is in half an hour.
Without a shot...

583
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:15,634
- This is a veterinary practice.
- I know.

584
00:39:15,795 --> 00:39:19,426
All I'm asking for is a shot.
It's nothing...

585
00:39:20,675 --> 00:39:23,428
You're ashamed
of your slave-trading father.

586
00:39:23,636 --> 00:39:26,602
- Where do you get off...
- Ask him.

587
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:28,900
Yaya, come here.

588
00:39:29,058 --> 00:39:32,107
Tell him where you lived.
You'll see.

589
00:39:32,311 --> 00:39:35,029
Tell him where you slept.
Under bridges.

590
00:39:35,189 --> 00:39:38,571
With taxis, tyres and iron sheets.

591
00:39:38,735 --> 00:39:41,748
Now he's got the chance to play.

592
00:39:41,904 --> 00:39:44,111
Just give him a shot!

593
00:39:46,367 --> 00:39:48,040
Coach, let's go.

594
00:39:50,663 --> 00:39:53,083
Wait over there while I finish this.

595
00:39:53,249 --> 00:39:54,341
Thanks.

596
00:39:58,046 --> 00:40:00,062
He'll sort you out, you'll see.

597
00:40:04,635 --> 00:40:05,893
Is he your child?

598
00:40:08,473 --> 00:40:09,730
Yes, he's my son.

599
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:14,033
What?

600
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:17,863
- You don't believe me?
- Yes, I do.

601
00:40:18,024 --> 00:40:22,330
But when he looks you in the eye,
you bow your head.

602
00:40:22,487 --> 00:40:24,112
That's why I asked.

603
00:40:24,781 --> 00:40:28,292
I bow my head? Rubbish!

604
00:40:31,287 --> 00:40:33,008
You're still doing it.

605
00:40:40,797 --> 00:40:42,220
Get on it!

606
00:40:42,423 --> 00:40:44,511
What use is that?

607
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:50,400
Get warmed up.

608
00:40:50,556 --> 00:40:51,399
Goon!

609
00:40:52,642 --> 00:40:55,145
Talk to each other!

610
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:57,861
He's on his own!

611
00:41:01,609 --> 00:41:02,570
Yaya...

612
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,076
Mark number 3.
His legs have gone.

613
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:08,208
Mark him and wait for the ball.

614
00:41:09,409 --> 00:41:10,547
OK?

615
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:16,701
Let him go!

616
00:42:28,529 --> 00:42:29,668
Nice, eh?

617
00:42:36,829 --> 00:42:39,048
Each time he went round,
he said:

618
00:42:39,207 --> 00:42:41,805
"I should have listened
to my mother!"

619
00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:44,143
The trainer said:
"What did she say?"

620
00:42:44,337 --> 00:42:46,757
"I don't know,
I didn't listen to her!"

621
00:42:49,092 --> 00:42:50,764
"I didn't listen to her!"

622
00:42:54,806 --> 00:42:58,400
This is less funny.
Koen's report on Yaya.

623
00:42:58,601 --> 00:42:59,859
I know.

624
00:43:01,604 --> 00:43:04,404
I've read it. He's Flemish.

625
00:43:08,069 --> 00:43:09,374
He didn't write much.

626
00:43:09,529 --> 00:43:12,542
In Abidjan, he gave it his all!

627
00:43:13,408 --> 00:43:14,238
His all!

628
00:43:15,743 --> 00:43:17,464
What do you want me to do?

629
00:43:17,662 --> 00:43:20,675
Let him play once.
Just once.

630
00:43:20,832 --> 00:43:24,343
After yesterday and this,
no-one wants him to play.

631
00:43:24,544 --> 00:43:26,928
I've got good instincts.

632
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:28,473
You did.

633
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:32,269
José, you had good instincts.
One of the best.

634
00:43:32,427 --> 00:43:35,890
You brought us lots of people.
But in the last 2 years?

635
00:43:37,306 --> 00:43:40,190
- Are you kidding? I don't know...
- Who?

636
00:43:40,393 --> 00:43:41,698
Who have you brought to Belgium?

637
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:43,112
Boubacar.

638
00:43:43,312 --> 00:43:46,314
He plays for Anderlecht 1 match in 4.
They want to sell him.

639
00:43:47,483 --> 00:43:49,073
- Who else?
- Kouassi.

640
00:43:49,652 --> 00:43:51,373
He plays in Division 3, José.

641
00:43:52,488 --> 00:43:54,209
You've brought us no-one.

642
00:43:55,867 --> 00:43:57,160
- You're tired.
- No.

643
00:43:57,326 --> 00:43:59,877
It's not your fault.
It's Africa.

644
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:02,420
But I've good news for you.

645
00:44:02,582 --> 00:44:06,378
I need a scout for the youngsters.

646
00:44:06,586 --> 00:44:10,228
You look around, find them,
bring them back here.

647
00:44:10,423 --> 00:44:12,594
What do you mean?
You're burying me?

648
00:44:12,759 --> 00:44:14,182
Are you?

649
00:44:14,385 --> 00:44:15,844
No, on the contrary.

650
00:44:16,054 --> 00:44:18,937
You'l like it.
You work Sundays.

651
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:23,115
You can go to bars,
tell stories to the parents...

652
00:44:23,895 --> 00:44:25,152
I'll think about it.

653
00:44:44,791 --> 00:44:47,259
Hurry up, they've started!

654
00:45:00,556 --> 00:45:01,897
Faster.

655
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:08,309
What's up?

656
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:11,907
He told me to pay 2 euros
for training.

657
00:45:13,069 --> 00:45:15,156
You didn't tell me that.

658
00:45:17,323 --> 00:45:19,245
It's because you have to...

659
00:45:19,409 --> 00:45:20,951
It's a club...

660
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,717
I don't want to pay to play.

661
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:27,634
Yaya, they rent the pitch!

662
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,932
The trainer's a volunteer.

663
00:45:35,883 --> 00:45:36,845
Here.

664
00:45:38,302 --> 00:45:39,441
Don't worry.

665
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,266
Show them what you've got.

666
00:45:46,978 --> 00:45:50,027
I'l find a club that deserves you.

667
00:45:54,027 --> 00:45:54,904
Goon!

668
00:46:23,014 --> 00:46:24,236
What's your name?

669
00:46:25,141 --> 00:46:26,731
Koné Yaya.

670
00:46:26,893 --> 00:46:28,103
"Koné Yaya."

671
00:46:29,395 --> 00:46:31,483
I like the way you play.

672
00:46:31,647 --> 00:46:33,866
- How old are you?
-19.

673
00:46:34,025 --> 00:46:36,445
- Where you from?
- Cote d'Ivoire.

674
00:46:38,571 --> 00:46:40,362
Get dressed, I'll wait for you.

675
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:51,636
- Who gave you this address?
- The old man.

676
00:46:51,793 --> 00:46:54,189
- What old man?
- Stockman.

677
00:46:54,337 --> 00:46:55,890
Why aren't you working?

678
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:01,271
You can walk if you want.

679
00:47:01,427 --> 00:47:02,780
With me, you'll run.

680
00:47:12,313 --> 00:47:14,116
It's me. What's up?

681
00:47:15,274 --> 00:47:16,236
What?

682
00:47:16,859 --> 00:47:19,410
You're kidding!
What after-sales service?

683
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:22,785
I sell football players,
not washing machines!

684
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,208
What?

685
00:47:26,244 --> 00:47:27,287
You're kidding.

686
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:30,003
Hold on.

687
00:47:30,164 --> 00:47:32,917
Wait. I've no idea!

688
00:47:33,084 --> 00:47:36,845
I don't spend my time
with my hand in my player's pants.

689
00:47:38,756 --> 00:47:40,642
OK. Calm down.

690
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,426
I'll take care of it, OK?

691
00:47:42,885 --> 00:47:45,804
I'll take care of it.
I'l call you back.

692
00:47:51,144 --> 00:47:52,567
Change of plan.

693
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:13,298
Hello.

694
00:48:14,375 --> 00:48:15,798
I've come for my player.

695
00:48:16,586 --> 00:48:18,306
The Ivorian. Boubacar.

696
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:20,638
I'm his agent.

697
00:48:20,798 --> 00:48:21,676
Sit down.

698
00:48:21,883 --> 00:48:24,766
He's got a game in 3 hours
in Bruges.

699
00:48:25,595 --> 00:48:28,063
He's missed the bus,
so if you could...

700
00:48:29,807 --> 00:48:31,433
Ah, great! Thanks a lot.

701
00:48:32,602 --> 00:48:33,740
There's a hill to settle.

702
00:48:34,395 --> 00:48:38,405
6 Camparis, 650 euros?
It's a rip-off.

703
00:48:38,608 --> 00:48:42,665
He made a hole in the baize
with his cigarette.

704
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:44,576
That's the Congolese for you!

705
00:48:45,198 --> 00:48:46,942
Don't lie to people.

706
00:48:47,116 --> 00:48:48,872
He's drunk.
He doesn't remember.

707
00:48:49,035 --> 00:48:50,328
- Where's the hole?
- Pardon?

708
00:48:50,828 --> 00:48:53,961
You ask us to pay,
we have to see the hole.

709
00:48:54,165 --> 00:48:55,458
He's not wrong.

710
00:48:56,084 --> 00:48:57,721
If there really is a hole,

711
00:48:58,836 --> 00:49:01,221
show it to me for the insurance.

712
00:49:02,465 --> 00:49:03,758
Go find it.

713
00:49:04,759 --> 00:49:05,898
Find it!

714
00:49:14,936 --> 00:49:15,778
Goon.

715
00:49:23,736 --> 00:49:24,566
Here it is.

716
00:49:27,448 --> 00:49:28,492
Il go.

717
00:49:33,162 --> 00:49:34,384
Here it is.

718
00:49:40,753 --> 00:49:43,471
Coach, it wasn't made today.

719
00:49:44,382 --> 00:49:47,146
Come and look.
It wasn't made today.

720
00:49:48,469 --> 00:49:50,059
Can't you see it's a hole?

721
00:50:11,909 --> 00:50:15,089
Hello, baby.
I've bought you Chanel No 5.

722
00:50:15,747 --> 00:50:18,262
Chanel No 5, a large bottle.

723
00:50:18,416 --> 00:50:22,141
There wasn't any Chanel No 19.
It doesn't exist anymore.

724
00:50:22,378 --> 00:50:25,712
I asked. Chanel No 5 is better,
more expensive.

725
00:50:27,717 --> 00:50:31,478
I'l give it to my friend here.
He'll give it to you.

726
00:50:31,637 --> 00:50:34,106
At least you're sure to get it.

727
00:50:34,265 --> 00:50:35,108
Yeah.

728
00:50:35,308 --> 00:50:36,518
Yes, love you.

729
00:50:41,314 --> 00:50:42,156
Hey, you...

730
00:50:44,484 --> 00:50:47,568
Take some things to my girl
in Abidjan.

731
00:50:48,446 --> 00:50:51,246
I'm not going.
I'm here for a reason.

732
00:50:53,242 --> 00:50:55,746
Who are you?
What's your name?

733
00:50:55,912 --> 00:50:59,245
- Koné Yaya.
- I never heard of you.

734
00:50:59,415 --> 00:51:03,128
I know all the footballers.
I never heard of Yaya Koné.

735
00:51:03,294 --> 00:51:05,513
I know where they poach
the best players.

736
00:51:06,172 --> 00:51:08,106
But God doesn't help everyone.

737
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:10,142
Fool!

738
00:51:11,511 --> 00:51:13,765
The bus is already at Ghent.

739
00:51:13,971 --> 00:51:17,186
Here. You smell of alcohol.

740
00:51:28,569 --> 00:51:29,732
Stop the bus!

741
00:51:30,863 --> 00:51:32,085
Stop the bus!

742
00:52:06,399 --> 00:52:07,740
I've got something for you.

743
00:52:08,776 --> 00:52:11,576
Here. It's Deep Heat.

744
00:52:11,738 --> 00:52:12,746
Where'd you get this?

745
00:52:12,905 --> 00:52:15,171
- Thanks.
- I got it from the club.

746
00:52:15,366 --> 00:52:17,550
Yaya, come here.

747
00:52:21,664 --> 00:52:23,052
Someone to see you.

748
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:28,180
Ready for training, guys?

749
00:52:31,632 --> 00:52:36,022
You think you can turn up
and Koen will take you in?

750
00:52:41,601 --> 00:52:42,562
Where will you sleep?

751
00:52:44,353 --> 00:52:47,735
- She'll stay with me.
- No. That's impossible.

752
00:52:48,608 --> 00:52:51,325
- We'll be fine.
- Don't even think about it.

753
00:52:51,486 --> 00:52:53,787
Football's what matters.
Concentrate.

754
00:52:53,988 --> 00:52:55,744
- It'll be fine, coach.
- No!

755
00:52:56,282 --> 00:52:58,667
Stop playing Mother Teresa.
She can't stay with you.

756
00:52:58,826 --> 00:53:02,219
- We can't leave her outside.
- No. But let me handle it.

757
00:53:02,372 --> 00:53:04,803
Can you go get a milkshake?

758
00:53:04,999 --> 00:53:06,007
They're very good.

759
00:53:06,667 --> 00:53:10,511
The best favour you can do her
is to send her back to Abidjan.

760
00:53:11,297 --> 00:53:12,424
Understand?

761
00:53:13,633 --> 00:53:16,598
Next year,
she'll be on the game.

762
00:53:16,803 --> 00:53:17,846
It's her life.

763
00:53:18,012 --> 00:53:20,527
Answer me honestly.

764
00:53:21,808 --> 00:53:24,276
Are you happy here?

765
00:53:24,435 --> 00:53:26,642
I've imported 23 players.

766
00:53:26,854 --> 00:53:28,147
23.

767
00:53:28,314 --> 00:53:32,158
They all said they were very happy.

768
00:53:32,944 --> 00:53:34,249
But they didn't mean it.

769
00:53:37,532 --> 00:53:39,703
Touch, or else you can't go.

770
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:46,251
I can't give you exact figures.

771
00:53:46,416 --> 00:53:47,839
What can I guarantee you?

772
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,421
The best. I'll get it.

773
00:53:50,586 --> 00:53:53,434
A club, a salary.

774
00:53:53,589 --> 00:53:57,101
An apartment, better than this one.
A real place.

775
00:53:57,260 --> 00:53:59,561
I can't decide just like that.

776
00:53:59,721 --> 00:54:02,485
Before we go any further,
look at this.

777
00:54:03,725 --> 00:54:04,733
Thanks.

778
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:06,438
Listen.

779
00:54:06,602 --> 00:54:09,651
You must sign this document.

780
00:54:09,814 --> 00:54:13,445
With this, I'll look for a contract
straightaway.

781
00:54:14,152 --> 00:54:16,488
I'll find one within a week.

782
00:54:16,654 --> 00:54:18,955
In a month, you'll be playing
for a big club.

783
00:54:19,407 --> 00:54:21,459
Not reserves. First team.

784
00:54:21,617 --> 00:54:22,507
Where is this club?

785
00:54:23,494 --> 00:54:27,872
Look.
I got a fax from Vardar Skopje.

786
00:54:28,082 --> 00:54:30,419
- It's better.
- Is it a good club?

787
00:54:30,585 --> 00:54:32,460
It's a Macedonian club.

788
00:54:33,713 --> 00:54:35,303
You know Macedonia?

789
00:54:35,465 --> 00:54:36,592
Yugoslavia.

790
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,805
- That's in Europe?
- Yes, itis.

791
00:54:39,969 --> 00:54:41,986
It's 2,200km from here.

792
00:54:43,097 --> 00:54:45,304
Here. Sign there.

793
00:54:54,108 --> 00:54:55,959
Hello. José Stockman.

794
00:54:56,110 --> 00:54:58,673
Here to see Koen. Is he in?

795
00:54:58,821 --> 00:54:59,830
Come in.

796
00:55:07,038 --> 00:55:08,248
Darling?

797
00:55:09,499 --> 00:55:11,420
- Hi, Koen!
- Hi, José.

798
00:55:12,335 --> 00:55:13,758
All right?

799
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,854
- My wife, Rita.
- We've met.

800
00:55:19,675 --> 00:55:21,941
It was unbearable.

801
00:55:22,095 --> 00:55:24,219
- Really?
- Yes.

802
00:55:24,389 --> 00:55:27,022
You can't believe the fuss she made.

803
00:55:28,351 --> 00:55:32,112
At home,
with the neighbours, my family...

804
00:55:33,272 --> 00:55:34,115
And at the club.

805
00:55:35,483 --> 00:55:37,535
She even went to see the chairman.

806
00:55:38,111 --> 00:55:41,693
"Chairman, he's left me
for an African whore!"

807
00:55:42,323 --> 00:55:44,624
You should've seen my face!

808
00:55:45,493 --> 00:55:47,664
- What did I look like?
- With your bubu!

809
00:55:48,621 --> 00:55:49,713
My bubu...

810
00:55:52,875 --> 00:55:53,765
And you?

811
00:55:58,923 --> 00:56:01,142
- I'm not so good.
- Really?

812
00:56:01,926 --> 00:56:03,184
I've got problems.

813
00:56:04,178 --> 00:56:05,258
Because of you.

814
00:56:07,056 --> 00:56:07,899
Because of me?

815
00:56:09,475 --> 00:56:12,156
In Abidjan, you were thinking
with your cock.

816
00:56:13,104 --> 00:56:14,065
Keep your voice down!

817
00:56:14,272 --> 00:56:15,660
Did you see what you wrote?

818
00:56:15,857 --> 00:56:19,119
Let's talk about this over a drink.

819
00:56:19,318 --> 00:56:20,587
No, no, no.

820
00:56:20,737 --> 00:56:22,824
Give me another report.

821
00:56:23,448 --> 00:56:25,001
A more positive one.

822
00:56:25,158 --> 00:56:27,079
Didn't I make it clear?

823
00:56:27,243 --> 00:56:29,829
Africa is over for me.

824
00:56:30,621 --> 00:56:34,133
Can you imagine stirring it up again?

825
00:56:34,917 --> 00:56:38,050
- It'll be a nightmare.
- Really?

826
00:56:38,254 --> 00:56:40,390
Want to see a nightmare?
Look.

827
00:56:41,549 --> 00:56:42,392
See her?

828
00:56:43,551 --> 00:56:44,559
Recognise her?

829
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:48,188
- What is this?
- "This"?

830
00:56:49,057 --> 00:56:51,192
Her name's Fleur.

831
00:56:51,350 --> 00:56:53,735
The bumble bee planted his seed.

832
00:56:54,145 --> 00:56:55,817
With your creative willy.

833
00:56:56,481 --> 00:56:58,996
Zwijn! You got her pregnant.

834
00:57:01,319 --> 00:57:02,790
But I'll take care of it.

835
00:57:02,945 --> 00:57:05,033
I'l do you a favour.

836
00:57:05,198 --> 00:57:07,214
Know what you're gonna do?

837
00:57:07,367 --> 00:57:10,451
Write me a positive report on Yaya

838
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:12,210
and we'll forget all about it.

839
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:17,042
No! That's no good!

840
00:57:17,210 --> 00:57:21,006
You need to be more lyrical.
More praise.

841
00:57:21,172 --> 00:57:23,972
I'm sorry, I'm stressed.
I can't doit.

842
00:57:24,133 --> 00:57:26,020
I'l dictate, you type.

843
00:57:26,177 --> 00:57:28,977
- Sure they won't get out?
- Don't worry.

844
00:57:30,932 --> 00:57:32,189
"Young Koné...

845
00:57:34,936 --> 00:57:36,229
"combines..."

846
00:57:36,396 --> 00:57:38,697
No. "This magnificent player
combines...

847
00:57:40,274 --> 00:57:43,620
"endurance and strength.

848
00:57:46,030 --> 00:57:48,201
"Furthermore, he is able

849
00:57:49,325 --> 00:57:51,876
"to score with both feet.

850
00:57:52,036 --> 00:57:54,706
"The left and the right."

851
00:57:55,998 --> 00:57:57,221
Are you here for a while?

852
00:57:59,252 --> 00:58:01,209
Want a drink?

853
00:58:02,422 --> 00:58:03,679
Ah, darling,

854
00:58:04,424 --> 00:58:07,852
I invited your friend's friends in.

855
00:58:08,052 --> 00:58:09,429
This is my husband, Koen.

856
00:58:11,264 --> 00:58:12,355
Hello.

857
00:58:17,061 --> 00:58:18,983
I was saying that this weekend,

858
00:58:19,147 --> 00:58:22,813
we could take them
to the Christmas fair.

859
00:58:24,235 --> 00:58:25,658
Oh, yes, yes...

860
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:28,668
You should go.
It's very nice. Yes.

861
00:58:28,865 --> 00:58:30,407
There's a stall

862
00:58:30,992 --> 00:58:33,198
with a shop

863
00:58:33,411 --> 00:58:36,128
where they make puddings.

864
00:58:36,289 --> 00:58:37,333
Very good ones.

865
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:40,838
There's one
with brown-sugar biscuit.

866
00:58:41,002 --> 00:58:42,343
Brown sugar...

867
00:58:43,755 --> 00:58:45,510
Do you know it?

868
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:50,062
Do you have that in Cote d'Ivoire?

869
00:58:52,889 --> 00:58:55,510
It's very good.

870
00:59:22,543 --> 00:59:24,264
Here, a present for you.

871
00:59:24,462 --> 00:59:26,384
To celebrate you joining the Zebras.

872
00:59:30,802 --> 00:59:31,763
You like them?

873
00:59:37,558 --> 00:59:38,732
Try them on.

874
00:59:38,893 --> 00:59:41,397
Break them in.

875
01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:03,721
30,000 spectators.

876
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:18,779
- This is Yaya's ultrasound.
- Ultrasound?

877
01:00:18,975 --> 01:00:21,905
He has a ventricular hypertrophy.

878
01:00:22,103 --> 01:00:23,562
So what?

879
01:00:23,730 --> 01:00:27,241
There's a risk of heart attack
when under duress.

880
01:00:27,442 --> 01:00:30,159
It may happen tomorrow, or never.

881
01:00:30,319 --> 01:00:32,574
- Give me percentages!
- 10, 12%.

882
01:00:32,739 --> 01:00:36,452
Have you seen
how many millions we owe?

883
01:00:36,617 --> 01:00:38,836
He's our golden fleece!

884
01:00:39,287 --> 01:00:42,134
And you say:
"He may have a heart attack."

885
01:00:42,290 --> 01:00:44,924
Please!
We're running the same risk.

886
01:00:45,126 --> 01:00:46,752
The bills give me a heart attack.

887
01:00:46,919 --> 01:00:48,212
It's a life we're talking about.

888
01:00:48,421 --> 01:00:51,481
My granddad had the same thing.

889
01:00:51,632 --> 01:00:53,934
He's still alive.

890
01:00:54,135 --> 01:00:55,642
If he was my son...

891
01:00:55,845 --> 01:00:57,850
We need to make money!

892
01:00:58,014 --> 01:00:59,686
Doctor, he's not your son.

893
01:00:59,891 --> 01:01:02,240
- Anyway...
- What? He's Black?

894
01:01:02,435 --> 01:01:05,400
- I didn't say that.
- You thought it.

895
01:01:05,563 --> 01:01:08,197
That's it. I've decided. It's over.

896
01:01:08,399 --> 01:01:11,484
You want to kill him?
Stop him playing.

897
01:01:11,694 --> 01:01:12,905
Stop him playing.

898
01:01:13,112 --> 01:01:15,746
If he doesn't play,
he'll shoot himself.

899
01:01:15,948 --> 01:01:18,511
He ate every other day at home.

900
01:01:19,118 --> 01:01:23,010
Now he eats every day
and feeds 40 people in Africa.

901
01:01:23,164 --> 01:01:25,833
Now make your decision.

902
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,856
Tell him he can't play
because of his heart.

903
01:01:30,046 --> 01:01:31,339
Ethically speaking...

904
01:01:31,547 --> 01:01:33,635
Ethics don't feed anyone!

905
01:01:33,841 --> 01:01:35,218
Forget it!

906
01:01:35,426 --> 01:01:38,890
Tell him why he's not playing.

907
01:01:40,014 --> 01:01:43,348
Because of this?
He'll laugh in your face!

908
01:01:43,518 --> 01:01:44,692
José, calm down.

909
01:01:44,852 --> 01:01:47,189
Can he decide for himself?

910
01:01:47,397 --> 01:01:49,865
He must be sure.
His life is in danger.

911
01:01:50,024 --> 01:01:51,566
I'l explain it to him.

912
01:02:20,555 --> 01:02:21,385
OK, Coach?

913
01:02:23,641 --> 01:02:24,484
Is there a problem?

914
01:03:53,481 --> 01:03:56,565
- He's OK.
- This is just the start.

915
01:03:59,362 --> 01:04:02,115
You'd make a silk purse
out of a sow's ear.

916
01:04:05,076 --> 01:04:07,829
Get on the bonnet with the chairman.

917
01:04:08,913 --> 01:04:09,921
With my player.

918
01:04:10,081 --> 01:04:11,837
Look this way!

919
01:04:15,044 --> 01:04:17,476
Show us the car keys.

920
01:04:20,925 --> 01:04:22,467
Thank you, chairman.

921
01:04:23,177 --> 01:04:24,518
This way! Yayal

922
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:28,565
We have a problem.

923
01:04:28,766 --> 01:04:30,985
Someone says
he's signed Yaya.

924
01:04:32,895 --> 01:04:35,541
- He'd have to go through me.
- OK, then.

925
01:04:35,690 --> 01:04:38,335
Tomorrow, fax me your contract.

926
01:04:38,484 --> 01:04:41,782
I don't have one.
I work on trust.

927
01:04:41,988 --> 01:04:43,541
On trust?

928
01:04:44,032 --> 01:04:45,075
You're crazy.

929
01:04:52,832 --> 01:04:53,924
Well?

930
01:04:56,044 --> 01:04:57,336
I told him...

931
01:05:06,846 --> 01:05:07,985
Is there a problem?

932
01:05:10,808 --> 01:05:11,852
Excuse me.

933
01:05:34,374 --> 01:05:36,390
Coach, I'm sorry.

934
01:05:38,211 --> 01:05:41,010
Why? I wanted a bastard.
You are one.

935
01:05:42,382 --> 01:05:44,137
When were you gonna tell me?

936
01:05:45,259 --> 01:05:46,636
When?

937
01:05:53,434 --> 01:05:54,277
Hello?

938
01:05:54,477 --> 01:05:55,770
Abdou, it's Yaya.

939
01:05:55,978 --> 01:05:56,951
All right?

940
01:05:57,146 --> 01:05:59,614
Yes, not too bad.

941
01:06:00,858 --> 01:06:01,938
Not too bad.

942
01:06:03,361 --> 01:06:05,033
- And you?
- Fine.

943
01:06:05,238 --> 01:06:07,539
I'm at the market buying oranges.

944
01:06:08,449 --> 01:06:09,279
Yes, it's good.

945
01:06:09,492 --> 01:06:10,915
I've seen show.

946
01:06:11,577 --> 01:06:13,879
Yes, it's pretty.
Very pretty.

947
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:15,124
Send me some snow.

948
01:06:15,331 --> 01:06:18,380
You want a Playstation or snow?

949
01:06:18,584 --> 01:06:21,254
- Both.
- You want everything?

950
01:06:21,421 --> 01:06:23,141
Abdou, they gave me a car.

951
01:06:25,925 --> 01:06:27,728
But the pedals are wrong.

952
01:06:27,927 --> 01:06:29,268
There's only two.

953
01:06:29,762 --> 01:06:31,399
Check it out. There are three.

954
01:06:31,848 --> 01:06:34,528
There's only two, I tell you!

955
01:06:35,435 --> 01:06:37,771
And the gears are just letters.

956
01:06:37,937 --> 01:06:38,780
What letters?

957
01:06:38,980 --> 01:06:42,955
P,R,NandD.

958
01:06:44,652 --> 01:06:47,416
- R must mean run.
- And P is pray?

959
01:06:48,614 --> 01:06:50,702
If Ris run, P is pray.

960
01:06:50,867 --> 01:06:51,709
dio!

961
01:07:19,937 --> 01:07:20,981
What?

962
01:08:27,088 --> 01:08:29,722
Give them to someone.
They're new.

963
01:09:19,974 --> 01:09:21,826
- Is it him?
- What's left of him.

964
01:09:22,853 --> 01:09:23,765
Not much.

965
01:09:24,645 --> 01:09:27,493
That's why
you shouldn't play with it.

966
01:09:33,946 --> 01:09:36,165
I'l take his ashes
to his home village.

967
01:09:36,366 --> 01:09:37,753
Koné is a Muslim name.

968
01:09:39,619 --> 01:09:41,161
The imam will cut off your balls!

969
01:09:50,671 --> 01:09:52,143
- Hello, boss.
- Hello.

970
01:09:53,216 --> 01:09:55,232
- You're selling?
- Yeah.

971
01:09:55,385 --> 01:09:58,018
- How much?
- 150.

972
01:09:58,179 --> 01:10:00,314
1507? And this one?

973
01:10:00,473 --> 01:10:02,348
It's already sold.

974
01:10:02,517 --> 01:10:03,810
That one too.

975
01:10:04,435 --> 01:10:05,859
I've got 100.

976
01:10:06,020 --> 01:10:08,405
- No. 120.
- I've only got 100.

977
01:10:08,564 --> 01:10:11,198
- 110.
- Come down to 100.

978
01:10:14,904 --> 01:10:17,834
- Close it and put it in the car.
- What about the body?

979
01:10:38,803 --> 01:10:40,523
You can't wash shirts.

980
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:41,818
What, and you can?

981
01:10:41,973 --> 01:10:44,108
Yes. You can't wash anything.

982
01:10:45,268 --> 01:10:46,276
Abdou!

983
01:11:22,513 --> 01:11:25,231
Would you like to be my assistant?

984
01:11:25,433 --> 01:11:26,572
It's not difficult.

985
01:11:27,435 --> 01:11:28,692
You go to Yopougon.

986
01:11:30,063 --> 01:11:33,776
Watch the match, like before.
Spot the best players.

987
01:11:33,941 --> 01:11:37,453
Take their parents' number
and I'm there.

988
01:11:38,446 --> 01:11:40,878
It'd be good.
You'd be my scout.

989
01:11:42,617 --> 01:11:44,040
It's a good job.

990
01:11:44,202 --> 01:11:47,334
You're made for the role.

991
01:11:47,497 --> 01:11:49,418
You've got good instincts.

992
01:11:49,791 --> 01:11:52,222
- Don't you want to?
- No.

993
01:11:53,044 --> 01:11:54,136
It's white man's work.

994
01:12:26,202 --> 01:12:29,002
- Can you call her?
- And say what?

995
01:12:29,163 --> 01:12:30,765
She knows my number.

996
01:12:31,874 --> 01:12:33,761
If you call her, it's different.

997
01:12:34,544 --> 01:12:35,386
She's busy.

998
01:12:36,254 --> 01:12:38,437
She'll call you later.

999
01:12:38,589 --> 01:12:41,674
Be patient.
Gigi's different with you.

1000
01:12:42,719 --> 01:12:45,483
She talks about you fondly.

1001
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:46,937
Not like the others.

1002
01:12:47,140 --> 01:12:50,058
We've been together 3 years.
Why doesn't she tell me?

1003
01:12:50,268 --> 01:12:54,360
It's hard for ex-streetwalkers
to feel love.

1004
01:12:54,522 --> 01:12:55,365
Do you love Gigi?

1005
01:12:57,025 --> 01:12:58,293
Yeah.

1006
01:12:58,443 --> 01:13:00,779
Really?
Then teach her to love you.

1007
01:13:00,987 --> 01:13:01,817
Really teach her.

1008
01:13:50,828 --> 01:13:52,668
Push it into position.

1009
01:13:52,830 --> 01:13:53,922
There, like that.

1010
01:13:54,082 --> 01:13:55,837
Other side. That's it.

1011
01:13:57,418 --> 01:13:58,497
Thank you.

1012
01:14:17,730 --> 01:14:22,452
Hey, Mum!
Who's that in the box?

1013
01:14:22,902 --> 01:14:26,414
Our eldest son.
We're taking him back to the village.

1014
01:14:27,907 --> 01:14:30,826
What about the little one inside?

1015
01:14:31,911 --> 01:14:33,584
It's a boy.

1016
01:14:34,580 --> 01:14:36,383
Whitey's the dad.

1017
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:39,172
Congratulations!

1018
01:14:40,628 --> 01:14:43,547
I said you discovered Aruna Dindane.

1019
01:15:00,857 --> 01:15:03,989
The stiff's shitting rice!

1020
01:15:34,932 --> 01:15:37,401
Mr Koné, José Stockman.

1021
01:15:38,102 --> 01:15:40,321
We met at the airport, remember?

1022
01:15:47,445 --> 01:15:48,287
Yaya is dead.

1023
01:15:54,077 --> 01:15:54,919
I'm sorry.

1024
01:16:03,878 --> 01:16:05,266
What did he say?
Does he want to kill me?

1025
01:16:05,421 --> 01:16:07,592
No. He said to kill a goat.

1026
01:16:09,509 --> 01:16:11,099
Welcome!

1027
01:16:11,719 --> 01:16:13,096
He was well liked.

1028
01:16:13,846 --> 01:16:15,388
This is a big paper.

1029
01:16:22,313 --> 01:16:24,698
The new jewel of Charleroi

1030
01:16:34,117 --> 01:16:36,003
God bless you!

1031
01:16:36,202 --> 01:16:39,666
For the good life
you gave to Yaya.

1032
01:16:44,669 --> 01:16:47,516
He thanks you for everything
you did for his son.

1033
01:16:59,517 --> 01:17:02,649
- No!
- Leave it! Look.

1034
01:17:02,812 --> 01:17:06,359
- We can't leave him...
- He's fine there.

1035
01:17:28,087 --> 01:17:31,220
To Serge and Bibo
