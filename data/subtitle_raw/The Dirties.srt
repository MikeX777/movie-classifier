1
00:00:10,065 --> 00:00:15,915
This film contains graphic violence
and is intended for adults.

2
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:24,640
Out of respect for the victims and
Family pictures are not edited.

3
00:00:29,186 --> 00:00:31,600
Can you hear me out there?

4
00:00:32,636 --> 00:00:34,102
Can you hear me out there?

5
00:00:34,303 --> 00:00:36,863
These things are great.
Our best investment ever.

6
00:00:37,063 --> 00:00:38,995
Do you hear me?
- You do not need to test ...

7
00:00:39,196 --> 00:00:42,120
Do you hear me?

8
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,320
Sorry.

9
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,442
We make a movie.
- Oh, we.

10
00:00:45,642 --> 00:00:47,082
You too?
- Yes.

11
00:00:47,282 --> 00:00:48,744
What?
- A horror movie.

12
00:00:48,944 --> 00:00:50,384
You are joking.
- No.

13
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:53,407
We make a film about
bullies at school, did you?

14
00:00:53,607 --> 00:00:55,546
Ours is about a monster ...

15
00:00:55,747 --> 00:00:59,084
... and he killed ... actually ...

16
00:00:59,285 --> 00:01:01,563
So basically he is a murderer.

17
00:01:01,764 --> 00:01:04,670
And there is a secret
public service.

18
00:01:04,871 --> 00:01:08,308
And enabled
to track down the killer ...

19
00:01:08,509 --> 00:01:10,340
... and arrest him.

20
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:13,596
Because they do not know yet
that he is a monster.

21
00:01:13,796 --> 00:01:17,612
And then there are two
detectives who are now dead.

22
00:01:17,813 --> 00:01:20,384
But ... and they come from England.

23
00:01:20,584 --> 00:01:23,265
And they are both brutal
murdered in a forest.

24
00:01:23,465 --> 00:01:25,106
This is insane.
- Yes.

25
00:01:25,307 --> 00:01:28,902
Our film is about two
students at school ...

26
00:01:29,102 --> 00:01:31,408
... being bullied by a
gang, <i> The Dirties </ i>.

27
00:01:31,608 --> 00:01:34,088
- And they take revenge by ...
- To murder them?

28
00:01:34,288 --> 00:01:36,450
Yes! They have a
arsenal of weaponry, ...

29
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:39,500
... and they shoot them from
a distance down.

30
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,247
And then they go to
The Rectum club ...

31
00:01:41,447 --> 00:01:42,888
... and murder them
them also and there ...

32
00:01:43,088 --> 00:01:44,693
Wow
- Yeah, it's great.

33
00:01:44,893 --> 00:01:46,406
That's the club from <i> irreversable </ i>.

34
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:50,343
And then there's a scene where
use the <i> Dirties </ i> cocaine ...

35
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:52,615
... and we invade
with guns and going of ...

36
00:01:52,815 --> 00:01:54,589
"Die, dirty bastards."

37
00:01:55,851 --> 00:01:57,902
As these lines in <i> Usual Suspects </ i>.

38
00:01:58,102 --> 00:02:00,566
He plays that other guy.
- Yes, I'm the other one.

39
00:02:00,766 --> 00:02:04,295
And there's a scene where ...
wait a minute, where ...

40
00:02:04,495 --> 00:02:07,809
I have to go.
- Yes I come, secondje.

41
00:02:09,218 --> 00:02:10,633
Never mind, we
have also gone.

42
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:12,642
Here, have a script.

43
00:02:12,842 --> 00:02:15,107
Our film is called <i> The Dirties </ i>
yours <i> The Visitor </ i>?

44
00:02:15,307 --> 00:02:17,788
Pleasant acquaintance.
- He's still ot off.

45
00:02:17,988 --> 00:02:19,717
I hope you
film is timid.

46
00:02:19,917 --> 00:02:22,012
Wireless microphones are recommended.

47
00:02:22,212 --> 00:02:23,707
Ok ?, but he is not finished yet.

48
00:02:23,907 --> 00:02:25,108
<i> Peace </ i>.

49
00:02:26,265 --> 00:02:28,330
To whom do you think those guys?

50
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:31,920
You're with the bracket.
I'm the smart who wrote the script.

51
00:02:33,766 --> 00:02:35,220
That's us!

52
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,849
We should have them
say that it gets better.

53
00:02:38,049 --> 00:02:40,127
But that's a lie.
- Simply lied.

54
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:45,156
They should stop now ...
- It's getting worse.

55
00:02:49,475 --> 00:02:52,941
When I last
wife was in the world?

56
00:02:53,551 --> 00:02:55,092
Then there was always a man ...

57
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,835
OK OK?...

58
00:02:59,536 --> 00:03:02,925
Ok? Rauch.
Two Tangos at the entrance.

59
00:03:04,343 --> 00:03:08,428
Blow their flikkerlul off.
Those with green bandana.

60
00:03:08,727 --> 00:03:11,049
That's not getting laid tonight.

61
00:03:12,738 --> 00:03:16,795
Considering he is so small created
it will be a difficult shot.

62
00:03:25,123 --> 00:03:27,218
This film is sublime.

63
00:03:28,251 --> 00:03:30,119
Come on.
- Yes, I'm ready.

64
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,787
Action!

65
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:36,346
What are you doing now?
I thought we were good.

66
00:03:37,472 --> 00:03:40,106
Come Jared!
Puts you up against the wall.

67
00:03:41,359 --> 00:03:44,394
Ok ?!
Detectives ... detectives ...

68
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:47,058
Ok ?, action!

69
00:03:47,968 --> 00:03:50,635
You know how a Quarter Pounder
call with cheese in France?

70
00:03:50,835 --> 00:03:52,656
They not call it
Quarter Pounder with cheese?

71
00:03:52,856 --> 00:03:55,247
No idiot.
It is called as a Royale with cheese ...

72
00:03:55,447 --> 00:03:56,893
... because of the metric system.

73
00:03:57,093 --> 00:03:59,539
Royale with Cheese?
What do they call a Whopper?

74
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,226
They call it a Royale ...

75
00:04:01,426 --> 00:04:02,897
I should do this as Bane.

76
00:04:03,097 --> 00:04:04,592
"Generous and cheese ..."

77
00:04:04,792 --> 00:04:06,441
Beware, <i> Dirties </ i> ...

78
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,836
Is it friend?
- Damn ...

79
00:04:18,197 --> 00:04:20,298
Is everything alright?
- Yes thank you.

80
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:23,192
Let my hand go, buddy.

81
00:04:24,334 --> 00:04:27,000
What are you doing now?
- Let go of my hand.

82
00:04:28,503 --> 00:04:32,070
Are you in love with me or something?
- I'll hold your hand not fixed.

83
00:04:33,675 --> 00:04:36,511
Let go of my hand!
- I love them not solid guy!

84
00:04:36,711 --> 00:04:38,403
Oh, you want some pulling and pushing?

85
00:04:38,604 --> 00:04:40,108
Keep those other things.

86
00:04:46,633 --> 00:04:49,839
Can we you
even interview for our movie?

87
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,942
It's really simple. Just a
few questions about bullies.

88
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,030
It's fun.

89
00:04:57,717 --> 00:04:59,727
It is just simple and fun ...

90
00:04:59,927 --> 00:05:01,436
... and you can wirelessly
wear microphone.

91
00:05:01,636 --> 00:05:04,735
Oh god ... you make it
just stuck to your shirt or something?

92
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:08,919
Oops.
- These things are really timid.

93
00:05:10,796 --> 00:05:15,754
What do you think of bullying?
In general...

94
00:05:15,955 --> 00:05:19,137
Uh ...
<i> - Outside it sucks ... </ i>

95
00:05:19,337 --> 00:05:21,298
That is all
I could think of.

96
00:05:21,499 --> 00:05:24,412
<i> Do you have advice for people
which are often bullied? </ i>

97
00:05:26,188 --> 00:05:27,653
You should talk to someone.

98
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:31,750
There are many teachers
you can address ...

99
00:05:31,951 --> 00:05:33,302
... of both sexes.

100
00:05:33,502 --> 00:05:35,922
There is certainly plenty of support here.

101
00:05:36,123 --> 00:05:38,042
Anywhere I guess.

102
00:05:39,342 --> 00:05:42,163
The children know
who they can trust.

103
00:05:42,363 --> 00:05:45,570
Otherwise they
it just a chance.

104
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:47,541
It's a big step
they need to take.

105
00:05:47,741 --> 00:05:49,860
Our teachers do not so much.

106
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,660
If they interfere
with a fight ...

107
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,961
... they get themselves beaten.

108
00:05:55,921 --> 00:05:59,033
Gee, if you are not with them
can speak...

109
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:04,255
... and no one wants to help you,
then you should ...

110
00:06:05,161 --> 00:06:07,675
Fighting back just.
- You have to.

111
00:06:08,508 --> 00:06:13,383
Malkovich, Malkovich ...

112
00:06:21,747 --> 00:06:25,135
If they do not understand it
I'm screwed.

113
00:06:26,311 --> 00:06:29,928
They beat me up ...
- That happens all the time though.

114
00:06:30,129 --> 00:06:33,524
They're going to strike me dead ...
when they see this.

115
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:35,272
Beaten to death ...

116
00:06:35,473 --> 00:06:38,615
Why we use
no real girl?

117
00:06:38,816 --> 00:06:44,304
We film Chrissy in the classroom
After her speech ...

118
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:47,500
... and we just stop it
in its entirety in the film.

119
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:53,886
This is Krissy B. and Chrissy H.
- Hey.

120
00:06:54,087 --> 00:06:56,024
And this is our project for filmles.

121
00:06:57,349 --> 00:06:58,989
<i> Come with us. </ i>

122
00:06:59,781 --> 00:07:01,281
We make them in.

123
00:07:02,195 --> 00:07:03,695
Keep your mouth!

124
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,564
<i> The Dirties </ i> is much better.
- Shut up, Matt.

125
00:07:09,765 --> 00:07:11,394
Get out, shut himself!

126
00:07:16,683 --> 00:07:20,830
Wimp, sissy, wimp ...

127
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,211
Aside with your thick head.

128
00:07:30,348 --> 00:07:33,643
Matt? Do you like big cocks?

129
00:07:34,244 --> 00:07:35,260
H ?.

130
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,660
Where should you
mothers tits for?

131
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:42,070
Okay good. Can
back to the lights?

132
00:07:42,939 --> 00:07:44,215
Fine, okay ?.

133
00:07:47,512 --> 00:07:50,208
Are there any questions for
these ladies about the movie?

134
00:07:51,477 --> 00:07:55,035
About their film ...
anyone have any questions?

135
00:07:55,704 --> 00:07:58,437
Matt.
- Matt! <i> Big Matt </ i>

136
00:07:58,638 --> 00:08:02,546
Why did you
"Help, save me" in the movie?

137
00:08:03,406 --> 00:08:04,475
What?

138
00:08:04,676 --> 00:08:06,913
Why you said, "Help, save me"?

139
00:08:07,114 --> 00:08:10,413
I did not say that.
- What is not said?

140
00:08:10,614 --> 00:08:13,486
I did not say that.
- What not?

141
00:08:13,687 --> 00:08:15,936
"Help, save me."

142
00:08:33,255 --> 00:08:36,529
Let the detectives here
do not come near!

143
00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:39,829
Help Save me!
- Shut up! Are you serious?

144
00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:42,289
You get the purple glove!

145
00:08:44,038 --> 00:08:45,544
You do not find this funny?

146
00:08:45,745 --> 00:08:48,382
We can not use this.
- Why not?

147
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:50,622
Chris freaks out when she sees this.

148
00:08:50,823 --> 00:08:53,540
What can our Chrissy cares?

149
00:08:54,141 --> 00:08:56,477
Of course she's going to be angry.
We steal her likeness.

150
00:08:56,678 --> 00:08:59,181
Remove it from there.
I do not think she gets angry.

151
00:08:59,382 --> 00:09:01,940
How so? You stood here behind it all?

152
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:04,196
It is not good if she freaks out.

153
00:09:04,397 --> 00:09:06,493
Oh, not good for you!

154
00:09:07,893 --> 00:09:10,293
It would not be good for you!

155
00:09:10,739 --> 00:09:12,893
What are you doing now?
- I klooi with your micro.

156
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,925
You hopeless infatuation
our movie is in the way.

157
00:09:16,126 --> 00:09:20,556
It is not hopeless.
In the third year they gave me a note.

158
00:09:20,757 --> 00:09:23,971
She said she me
liked. A 10 to 10.

159
00:09:24,665 --> 00:09:26,154
Bullshit.

160
00:09:26,428 --> 00:09:28,845
No, that really happened
in the third year.

161
00:09:29,046 --> 00:09:32,390
You make it because
this clip want out.

162
00:09:32,591 --> 00:09:35,128
It's true.
Therefore, I want him out.

163
00:09:35,329 --> 00:09:39,215
Hot Chrissy was in love with you?
- A long time ago, but yes.

164
00:09:39,854 --> 00:09:41,680
What happened? Are you flipped?

165
00:09:42,116 --> 00:09:45,640
Yet ?? s time?
Shore Scene, sound, take two.

166
00:09:45,841 --> 00:09:49,111
Old man passes
with little money in his pocket.

167
00:09:56,843 --> 00:10:00,193
H ?, Give it back!
Come down there! Ok ?!

168
00:10:00,394 --> 00:10:04,730
I have not eaten for days.
Begone bum.

169
00:10:04,931 --> 00:10:09,573
All right, I'm leaving.
- What are you still doing?

170
00:10:09,774 --> 00:10:12,463
These are background voices.
Sound effects!

171
00:10:12,664 --> 00:10:17,954
As you <i> Baldur's Gate </ i> which
have conversation at the inn.

172
00:10:18,155 --> 00:10:23,119
"Well I just got here and I ..."
and then fades.

173
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,531
In each scene you have
the background noise.

174
00:10:25,732 --> 00:10:27,789
This is the old beggar and gull.

175
00:10:32,066 --> 00:10:34,382
Then I have to
bird but eat ...

176
00:10:37,024 --> 00:10:39,825
Do not laugh!
The recording must be pure.

177
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:44,196
Stop laughing!
For example, the audio recording is not working.

178
00:10:44,397 --> 00:10:47,368
Why are you in your underwear
for a sound?

179
00:10:47,728 --> 00:10:52,802
As Chrissy in love with you
maybe they really want to participate.

180
00:10:53,003 --> 00:10:55,679
She's not in love with me.
- Maybe.

181
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,456
That does not just evaporate.

182
00:10:59,557 --> 00:11:01,511
How can we find out?

183
00:11:01,712 --> 00:11:05,521
I've got it! We hide
a micro in her locker!

184
00:11:08,222 --> 00:11:10,135
Great idea.
Not crazy.

185
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,263
With micro in her locker ...

186
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:14,931
... let's walk over Owen.

187
00:11:15,219 --> 00:11:16,605
For example, therefore.

188
00:11:16,806 --> 00:11:20,422
And then she says either:
"Oh god, there is Owen."

189
00:11:20,623 --> 00:11:22,828
or "There is that flicker again."

190
00:11:24,175 --> 00:11:25,490
That is a good plan.

191
00:11:25,691 --> 00:11:28,550
And you do pass of Malcolm X.

192
00:11:28,751 --> 00:11:29,751
You know.

193
00:11:29,951 --> 00:11:31,970
Spike Lee teaches it to Denzel.

194
00:11:32,171 --> 00:11:36,463
And then ... no idea
what year ...

195
00:11:36,664 --> 00:11:40,754
<i> ... there was that girl of 16
or something with her butterfly tattoo ... </ i>

196
00:11:40,955 --> 00:11:42,660
... I do not do anything about it ...

197
00:11:42,861 --> 00:11:45,841
It was not working.
They did not notice.

198
00:11:46,076 --> 00:11:49,235
Grab the edge
and really swing with your arm.

199
00:11:49,436 --> 00:11:50,525
Again.

200
00:11:54,153 --> 00:11:55,921
I think I want ...

201
00:12:00,241 --> 00:12:05,270
I think I have this year
for another outfit to go ...

202
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,400
We can hear everything
what they say.

203
00:12:08,601 --> 00:12:11,538
This girl is so dumb.

204
00:12:11,739 --> 00:12:13,139
Shut up...

205
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:18,736
Hey Chrissy there's your boyfriend.
- What? Owen?

206
00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:27,446
Too bad they laugh
as if it was a joke.

207
00:12:30,036 --> 00:12:33,844
So, "<i> Dirties </ i> ..."
What should I say?

208
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:37,194
Say: "<i> Dirties </ i> That?
is my problem. "

209
00:12:37,394 --> 00:12:40,828
"Ensuring you but better
numbers or both your pockets. "

210
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:44,153
"The <i> Dirties </ i>? That's my problem.
Worry you, but for better grades ... "

211
00:12:44,354 --> 00:12:46,805
"... Your pockets or both?"
- Yes.

212
00:12:47,006 --> 00:12:50,001
And then we say, "The
Deputy wants this thing! "

213
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:54,026
The deputy? That will not be the case.
I need you to take away!

214
00:12:54,227 --> 00:12:55,806
I told him he was worthless.

215
00:12:56,007 --> 00:12:57,403
Listen. Why do you work double ...

216
00:12:57,604 --> 00:12:59,200
Why do you work against the sheriff for help?

217
00:12:59,401 --> 00:13:00,891
The chain of command.

218
00:13:01,292 --> 00:13:03,138
I said it, worthless!
- Enough!

219
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:05,379
Here with your pennies!

220
00:13:07,434 --> 00:13:09,845
And now: "Aaah!"

221
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:12,407
- "No" or "Aah"?
- "Aaaah"

222
00:13:16,644 --> 00:13:17,691
Mr. Muldoon?

223
00:13:20,531 --> 00:13:23,306
Take exactly the same angle.

224
00:13:24,177 --> 00:13:26,188
So we sit in the same place.

225
00:13:28,109 --> 00:13:29,528
Is it so?

226
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:32,403
What did I say? What did he say?

227
00:13:33,414 --> 00:13:35,958
That chain of command and
then he is worthless.

228
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:37,653
I first do my Nick Nolte line.

229
00:13:37,854 --> 00:13:39,154
This is great.

230
00:13:39,355 --> 00:13:43,533
After all this time Kurt Cobain looks
still better off than Courtney Love.

231
00:13:44,748 --> 00:13:48,896
That's funny, still ...
- But that is not ours, plagiarism.

232
00:13:49,097 --> 00:13:50,597
Matt and Owen.

233
00:13:51,842 --> 00:13:55,990
Owen, tell your mother
it was cute in her bed.

234
00:13:56,671 --> 00:13:59,240
Got her appelvla
Matt already tasted?

235
00:14:02,118 --> 00:14:04,878
She was lovely.
- Yes, that will probably man.

236
00:14:05,503 --> 00:14:08,333
Where he has
in talking about?

237
00:14:09,076 --> 00:14:10,134
You got us?

238
00:14:10,484 --> 00:14:13,559
This should look very cinematic
because it is the last scene.

239
00:14:18,318 --> 00:14:20,146
This is it.
The <i> Dirties </ i> ...

240
00:14:20,347 --> 00:14:23,997
I can not ... I'm so
glad this is the last scene ...

241
00:14:24,776 --> 00:14:28,114
Yes, I would also finish.
But what do you think of this ...?

242
00:14:28,315 --> 00:14:31,105
In the end we make a montage ...

243
00:14:31,306 --> 00:14:35,501
... where we roam
and celebrate the fact that the film is finished.

244
00:14:35,966 --> 00:14:39,032
We can bangelijk number
<i> Best Coast </ i> under it.

245
00:15:35,204 --> 00:15:36,352
Come Rauch.

246
00:15:37,443 --> 00:15:39,169
Here they are.

247
00:15:39,369 --> 00:15:41,785
Remain silent and low to the ground.

248
00:15:46,031 --> 00:15:51,661
We are left with three smoking
accomplices east of the school.

249
00:15:52,808 --> 00:15:54,870
Use of the smoke to
to estimate the wind.

250
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:58,341
Mercenary 225, this mercenary
3 <i> Romeo Actual </ i>.

251
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:01,311
We have <i> Dirties </ i>
in the crosshairs at 225 meters.

252
00:16:01,785 --> 00:16:02,812
Ok? Rauch.

253
00:16:03,324 --> 00:16:05,096
That Dirty with green bandana ...

254
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,833
... blow his dick off.

255
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:08,083
Tricky shot ...

256
00:16:08,284 --> 00:16:11,544
Four hundred meter
small and apparently created.

257
00:16:12,477 --> 00:16:15,076
We mow down the fagots.
- Not 'fags' say.

258
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,911
Here I do <i> Joker </ i> <i> Dark Knight </ i>.

259
00:16:34,637 --> 00:16:35,825
Do you have the stuff? Oh!

260
00:16:36,826 --> 00:16:38,226
The <i> Dirties </ i>.

261
00:16:38,426 --> 00:16:40,645
Give me the keys, dirty motherfuckers affairs.

262
00:16:40,845 --> 00:16:43,139
Give me the keys, dirty bastards!

263
00:16:49,018 --> 00:16:50,844
What should I do with you?

264
00:16:51,044 --> 00:16:52,909
The <i> Dirties </ i> here waving the stick ...

265
00:16:53,109 --> 00:16:55,367
... stupid bastards!

266
00:16:55,567 --> 00:16:59,623
The <i> Dirties? That's my problem.
Think better of yourself. </ I>

267
00:17:00,398 --> 00:17:05,169
- You go bags, you know?
- Oh? However, since we do not give a shit about!

268
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:06,981
We're here to kill.

269
00:17:07,556 --> 00:17:09,558
<i> Too many extracurricular
Matt activities ... </ i>

270
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:13,592
Too many extracurricular?
"Too many extracurricular ..."

271
00:17:13,792 --> 00:17:17,525
- We go to the <i> Dirties </ i> tackle.
- And then we come to you, asshole.

272
00:17:17,725 --> 00:17:19,126
The chain of command!

273
00:17:19,326 --> 00:17:21,541
This bureaucrat
totally useless.

274
00:17:21,979 --> 00:17:24,016
Enough so!
Here with your pennies!

275
00:17:24,216 --> 00:17:26,988
Tokens? Tokens?

276
00:17:27,188 --> 00:17:29,803
We have none at all
tokens needed.

277
00:17:31,171 --> 00:17:33,843
Ge me the keys, dirty bastard!

278
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:02,927
Ok? ...

279
00:18:04,729 --> 00:18:08,775
You have to make adjustments.
- What? No wait ...

280
00:18:10,149 --> 00:18:13,834
The cursing to get out.
The guns also.

281
00:18:14,035 --> 00:18:16,442
No, we can
cursing censor.

282
00:18:16,643 --> 00:18:20,909
A film in which you teacher
shoot, that's not.

283
00:18:21,538 --> 00:18:24,768
You're going to pick him bald!
- No, I did not pick him bald.

284
00:18:24,969 --> 00:18:26,530
Listen. Think about it this way:

285
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:29,153
you have a movie
made for adults.

286
00:18:29,354 --> 00:18:31,189
This is your <i> director's cut </ i>.

287
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:37,897
Now I say it as a producer
it must be suitable for the cinema.

288
00:18:39,321 --> 00:18:43,573
You get those things out ...
- Dare it, take the risk.

289
00:18:44,074 --> 00:18:45,699
Take a risk for us.

290
00:18:47,527 --> 00:18:49,619
Come on!
- We're going to do it.

291
00:18:49,819 --> 00:18:52,019
You're going with this
material right away.

292
00:18:52,219 --> 00:18:54,169
It is a good rough version.

293
00:18:54,529 --> 00:18:56,579
You get those things out ...

294
00:18:56,779 --> 00:19:00,695
... and show me tomorrow
a better version.

295
00:19:02,367 --> 00:19:06,472
You make it a bit shorter
and the challenge is to ...

296
00:19:07,973 --> 00:19:10,616
Ok? boys, attention please.

297
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:13,496
Attention. Here theconservation.

298
00:19:13,997 --> 00:19:16,340
The teacher is now teaching.

299
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:18,080
Thanks. Silence please.

300
00:19:18,481 --> 00:19:20,990
Ok ?. We have something
exciting for you today.

301
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:24,749
Matt and Owen have
made a blockbuster for you.

302
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:29,050
Yesterday I already have a
seen taster.

303
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,033
It was pretty extreme ...

304
00:19:31,233 --> 00:19:33,429
... but really good.

305
00:19:33,629 --> 00:19:34,929
There's some of everything.

306
00:19:35,129 --> 00:19:38,620
Action, comedy, romance.

307
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,943
And it is a little
<i> Gender-bender </ i> ...

308
00:19:41,844 --> 00:19:44,007
It is a <i> genre-bender </ i>

309
00:19:44,207 --> 00:19:46,418
Sorry, what?
- It is a <i> genre-bender </ i>.

310
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,533
<I> genre-bender </ i> so.

311
00:19:49,134 --> 00:19:51,908
You want some more
come on tell?

312
00:19:52,309 --> 00:19:53,883
No? Ok ?.

313
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:59,085
Let's start there.

314
00:19:59,285 --> 00:20:00,686
Are the lights out?

315
00:20:01,536 --> 00:20:02,586
Ok ?.

316
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:05,887
Ready?

317
00:20:07,335 --> 00:20:08,340
Ok ?!

318
00:20:12,505 --> 00:20:15,091
"In a remote school
decided two students ...

319
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:17,269
... the local gang to wind up "

320
00:20:17,469 --> 00:20:18,638
Is this a joke?

321
00:20:34,614 --> 00:20:37,152
Thank you so fast
out, novice.

322
00:20:37,352 --> 00:20:39,890
This was the only place
I could think of.

323
00:20:41,682 --> 00:20:44,300
Can I trust you?
- Of course.

324
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,838
Are you ready for a blood oath?
- Show the knife but!

325
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:48,550
<i> This is Detective Johnson ... </ i>

326
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:52,909
Look now but just
to the film boys.

327
00:20:53,846 --> 00:20:55,289
No way back.

328
00:20:55,489 --> 00:20:56,939
<i> They're going to share AIDS. </ i>

329
00:20:59,644 --> 00:21:01,347
Are you sure they're here?

330
00:21:01,547 --> 00:21:03,105
Here we are.

331
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:06,305
This is annoying. I had something
with a singer here.

332
00:21:06,505 --> 00:21:08,383
A real piece I've heard.

333
00:21:18,262 --> 00:21:21,820
<i> Can we please them
give our attention? </ i>

334
00:21:22,844 --> 00:21:24,349
This is a spicy cottage ...

335
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:27,055
... but I do not think
<i> Dirties </ i> hiding here.

336
00:21:27,881 --> 00:21:29,077
That's my girl.

337
00:21:32,901 --> 00:21:35,058
She recognizes me probably not.

338
00:21:35,258 --> 00:21:37,205
We both look different.

339
00:21:37,405 --> 00:21:40,954
Malkovich, Malkovich ...

340
00:21:42,427 --> 00:21:45,479
That's you. So are you really.

341
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,733
Come on Matt.

342
00:21:58,909 --> 00:22:01,902
<i> You do not think this suspect?
She seems to want to tell us something </ i>

343
00:22:19,714 --> 00:22:21,907
What is this doing?

344
00:22:22,408 --> 00:22:24,865
Fuck you <i> Dirties </ i>.

345
00:22:26,617 --> 00:22:29,245
Damn, damn.
Stay away from me.

346
00:22:29,445 --> 00:22:30,745
Blood?

347
00:22:30,946 --> 00:22:33,139
Jesus Christ...

348
00:22:36,395 --> 00:22:37,811
Damn ...

349
00:22:38,665 --> 00:22:40,025
Let me look at it.

350
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:42,575
No, fuck off!
- Why are you mad at me?

351
00:22:43,382 --> 00:22:44,910
Touch me just not on.

352
00:22:48,713 --> 00:22:50,131
Did you see that?

353
00:22:50,331 --> 00:22:53,619
What happened?
- My friend was hit by a stone.

354
00:22:54,635 --> 00:22:58,079
Come on!
- Ok ?, damn ...

355
00:23:05,654 --> 00:23:07,204
Need your help?

356
00:23:07,404 --> 00:23:09,326
It's all right.
He has become accustomed.

357
00:23:09,527 --> 00:23:11,959
By what?
- A rock.

358
00:23:28,936 --> 00:23:31,902
We had those guys
? CHT have to shoot.

359
00:23:32,203 --> 00:23:34,923
We had all the <i> Dirties
</ i>? CHT should murder.

360
00:23:35,123 --> 00:23:37,662
Imagine that
we were able to show that film.

361
00:23:37,862 --> 00:23:39,636
A film where everyone is dead?

362
00:23:39,836 --> 00:23:42,017
No, if we just went ...

363
00:23:42,861 --> 00:23:45,979
If we just ...
What did Muldoon again?

364
00:23:46,179 --> 00:23:48,307
The fact that the film does not have a
school attack could go?

365
00:23:48,507 --> 00:23:49,908
If we were to make a film ...

366
00:23:50,108 --> 00:23:52,031
... where we only
bad guys shoot?

367
00:23:52,231 --> 00:23:54,919
We did that already?
- But when we did the CHT?

368
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:56,722
When we went? Chte guns ...

369
00:23:56,922 --> 00:23:58,874
... and only the bad guys killed?

370
00:23:59,074 --> 00:24:01,146
They simply blow for the camera!

371
00:24:01,346 --> 00:24:02,784
Muldoon would say:

372
00:24:02,984 --> 00:24:05,750
"You really do not have
listened to me. "

373
00:24:06,772 --> 00:24:09,938
<i> "He was too dark when
you still pretending. "</ i>

374
00:24:10,139 --> 00:24:11,822
<i> "Now you murder them real?" </ i>

375
00:24:12,501 --> 00:24:14,649
"Oh, you're going
they really cared murder? "

376
00:24:16,998 --> 00:24:18,143
That is funny.

377
00:24:21,591 --> 00:24:23,612
Oh, this is crazy.

378
00:24:24,221 --> 00:24:27,146
And it comes down to
everyone knows ...

379
00:24:27,346 --> 00:24:28,698
... we just have to
<i> Dirties </ i>.

380
00:24:28,898 --> 00:24:30,660
They know we only
for the bad guys to come.

381
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:33,576
We can do it on
put our T-shirts.

382
00:24:33,776 --> 00:24:35,226
With a megaphone ...

383
00:24:35,426 --> 00:24:38,404
"Do not panic! We seem dangerous,
and that we are ... "

384
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:41,465
"... but we are only here
to kill the bullies. "

385
00:24:41,665 --> 00:24:43,275
"If you've teased us ..."

386
00:24:43,475 --> 00:24:45,437
"... mighty, then
you have to be afraid! "

387
00:24:45,637 --> 00:24:47,535
"We're really murder!"

388
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:50,723
This is a timid idea.
We need to write it down.

389
00:24:50,923 --> 00:24:52,415
"<i> The Dirties 2 </ i>

390
00:25:00,675 --> 00:25:02,524
My God.

391
00:25:08,308 --> 00:25:10,051
You want some popcorn?

392
00:25:46,353 --> 00:25:48,116
Hardest part
Writing songs ...

393
00:25:48,317 --> 00:25:49,817
Owen, what do
You from here?

394
00:25:51,407 --> 00:25:52,501
For the attack.

395
00:25:56,463 --> 00:25:59,776
That's probably not safe.
For example, we promote a choking hazard.

396
00:26:00,077 --> 00:26:01,552
What did they used to be?

397
00:26:01,752 --> 00:26:03,821
You would die?
That used to sink.

398
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:06,515
The child dies if you
This draws on its head.

399
00:26:06,715 --> 00:26:08,226
It says that
you could choke.

400
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,607
Well, what is this
the hell?

401
00:26:14,495 --> 00:26:15,920
I lack nothing!

402
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,496
How about this?

403
00:26:17,696 --> 00:26:19,015
Is this shirt say?

404
00:26:19,516 --> 00:26:21,712
Both afscheurbroeken wear?

405
00:26:21,912 --> 00:26:23,540
Then we walk inside
and everyone says:

406
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,282
"Look at that gay pants!"

407
00:26:25,482 --> 00:26:27,032
And then we go from ...

408
00:26:31,212 --> 00:26:33,083
It is now not perfect?

409
00:26:34,524 --> 00:26:37,478
Crazed killers
always obsessed ...

410
00:26:37,678 --> 00:26:39,170
... by <i> Catcher in the Rye </ i>.

411
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:41,022
Nice of you to jachtpet contributes.

412
00:26:41,222 --> 00:26:42,623
No, not so!

413
00:26:43,096 --> 00:26:44,141
That is better.

414
00:26:44,341 --> 00:26:46,222
But this is still timid?
- Yes.

415
00:26:46,422 --> 00:26:49,190
School Attack ...
The <i> Catcher in the Rye </ i> theme ...

416
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:50,395
We are planning just a ball.

417
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,765
I hate this stupid game ...

418
00:27:05,965 --> 00:27:07,562
Let us play!

419
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:31,891
<i> Great. </ i>

420
00:27:46,843 --> 00:27:48,617
Any Which jeans and shirt?

421
00:27:48,817 --> 00:27:50,495
Can you bring two?

422
00:27:50,695 --> 00:27:52,191
Can you something
bring on Owen?

423
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:56,929
My phone is soaked.
Therefore, I call a payphone.

424
00:27:58,788 --> 00:28:00,729
No, I'm not done!

425
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,382
... Mom!

426
00:28:03,623 --> 00:28:05,667
They have thrown him into the toilet.

427
00:28:08,025 --> 00:28:10,318
As I said!
Hence the payphone.

428
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:14,537
Can you bring clothes here?

429
00:28:14,737 --> 00:28:16,145
I stand in my gymnastics clothes.

430
00:28:16,873 --> 00:28:18,356
Thanks.

431
00:28:18,556 --> 00:28:20,016
Verdomse bitch!

432
00:28:23,277 --> 00:28:24,711
"Why is your phone wet?"

433
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:26,618
"Why do not you call with your cell phone?"

434
00:28:27,152 --> 00:28:29,001
"Why do not you call with your cell phone?"

435
00:28:32,687 --> 00:28:34,140
Ok ?, well ...

436
00:28:34,984 --> 00:28:36,474
Matt? Is she there now?

437
00:28:36,674 --> 00:28:38,559
Just go already. I will wait.

438
00:28:46,735 --> 00:28:48,639
Oh yeah? What is this asshole?

439
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:51,362
What the hell is this?

440
00:28:51,562 --> 00:28:53,412
Who did this?

441
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:56,145
Was it you?

442
00:29:22,508 --> 00:29:24,973
Hello, I'm looking at blueprints
my school ...

443
00:29:25,173 --> 00:29:26,574
... for a school

444
00:29:26,774 --> 00:29:28,253
Her name: <i> 'Westmount High' </ i>.

445
00:29:28,921 --> 00:29:30,486
Only the plans?
- Yes.

446
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:33,830
Then you have the
reception there.

447
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:35,521
Thank you.

448
00:29:42,792 --> 00:29:45,053
Hello, I'm looking at blueprints
my school ...

449
00:29:45,253 --> 00:29:46,721
... for a project.

450
00:29:57,953 --> 00:30:00,116
Thanks a lot man.
Bye!

451
00:30:03,682 --> 00:30:07,915
Is it not alarming
I just got everything?

452
00:30:08,915 --> 00:30:11,935
No ... I had not even
my student card show.

453
00:30:14,248 --> 00:30:15,968
They have really given everything.

454
00:30:16,846 --> 00:30:18,901
How much is it
to print this?

455
00:30:31,554 --> 00:30:35,677
What is that guy stone
Owen threw to ...?

456
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:42,989
<i> My left, not your left. </ i>

457
00:30:47,516 --> 00:30:49,858
Do not make it too obvious.
<i> - Why use </ i>

458
00:30:50,058 --> 00:30:51,858
Make it just not clear!

459
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:54,210
<i> It does not matter, she can see it. </ i>

460
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:57,820
<i> I appreciate her,
as a work of art. </ i>

461
00:31:00,548 --> 00:31:02,945
Owen is obsessed with her.
- I'm not that.

462
00:31:03,245 --> 00:31:06,516
<i> Yes, that's what you do. </ i>
- Am I not.

463
00:31:07,716 --> 00:31:09,949
At what life is you now ...?

464
00:31:10,149 --> 00:31:11,549
I'm not obsessed ...

465
00:31:14,341 --> 00:31:17,133
What did you like doing?
- Sorry.

466
00:31:20,688 --> 00:31:23,599
Why do not you pay attention to?
Look, there's vanalles on my sweater.

467
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:25,556
This is an expensive sweater.
- Ok ?, sorry.

468
00:31:25,756 --> 00:31:28,159
Look at me!
Why are you looking at the ground?

469
00:31:28,459 --> 00:31:31,509
You spoil my lunch and punch
everything just down, damn it.

470
00:31:32,109 --> 00:31:33,964
Apologize! Stand up!

471
00:31:34,364 --> 00:31:35,853
Ok ?, I'm sorry.

472
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,762
What the hell was that?

473
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:40,454
Sorry, I wish you
lunch not interrupt ...

474
00:31:40,954 --> 00:31:44,399
What are you doing?
Become a damn once mature!

475
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:48,032
Make your game off, pick that shit up
and make it a pleasant day.

476
00:32:04,437 --> 00:32:05,467
<i> Feeny! </ i>

477
00:32:07,506 --> 00:32:08,770
<i> Feeny! </ i>

478
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,441
<i> Fe-e-e-ny! </ i>

479
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,880
<i> Feeny! </ i>

480
00:32:27,032 --> 00:32:28,437
Oh, fl ...

481
00:32:28,637 --> 00:32:30,058
Matt, what the hell are you doing here?

482
00:32:30,258 --> 00:32:31,657
Come on, I'll break you.

483
00:32:31,857 --> 00:32:33,307
I do not care anymore.

484
00:32:33,507 --> 00:32:34,976
I know. I release you!

485
00:32:35,176 --> 00:32:36,642
No, just go away ...

486
00:32:36,842 --> 00:32:38,244
Do your micro to.

487
00:32:39,274 --> 00:32:41,189
They will not hear you.
Do your micro to.

488
00:32:41,689 --> 00:32:44,830
I do not want...
- Do your micro to tight a second.

489
00:32:45,785 --> 00:32:47,799
This is the classic escape.

490
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,741
I can clearly not
to come outside.

491
00:32:55,141 --> 00:32:56,491
Grab your bike!

492
00:32:58,269 --> 00:32:59,936
I release you Jimmy!

493
00:34:19,367 --> 00:34:21,183
What is that? How do you call that?

494
00:34:25,621 --> 00:34:27,626
What is that? What's that?

495
00:34:27,826 --> 00:34:29,510
I call the double talk.

496
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:31,372
Did you then it invented?

497
00:34:31,572 --> 00:34:33,372
No, it's called
double talk and gibberish.

498
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:37,169
The girls who taught me
called double talk.

499
00:34:38,591 --> 00:34:41,118
How do you do it?
Idigo, idijis, idijoe, idiga ...?

500
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:47,707
You know what Nika Popeil
told me in the sixth year?

501
00:34:47,907 --> 00:34:54,429
She said: "I and Mark went lovemaking
today, but then there was stuff out. "

502
00:34:54,939 --> 00:34:56,684
And that was in the sixth year.

503
00:34:56,884 --> 00:34:59,426
I wore
Ninja Teddy jogging pants.

504
00:34:59,626 --> 00:35:01,363
And I went on: "WHAT?"

505
00:35:01,763 --> 00:35:03,163
Ninja Teddy?

506
00:35:03,689 --> 00:35:08,689
Yes, once in which
arcade near the school ...

507
00:35:08,889 --> 00:35:11,953
Do you remember those?

508
00:35:12,153 --> 00:35:13,378
Ryan Gahooley said:

509
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:16,528
"Hey, Johnson, jogging pants
out of fashion! "

510
00:35:18,278 --> 00:35:21,328
I just walked away and left
two quarters behind the game.

511
00:35:22,067 --> 00:35:25,165
Really?
- Yes, I was devastated.

512
00:35:25,365 --> 00:35:27,509
That was the first time
I was bullied ...

513
00:35:30,891 --> 00:35:33,359
... because I just
was myself, you know?

514
00:35:36,075 --> 00:35:39,126
What is that guy
who threw the stone?

515
00:35:42,404 --> 00:35:43,904
Shawn.

516
00:35:47,172 --> 00:35:48,587
What's his name?

517
00:35:50,493 --> 00:35:52,020
Spearing.

518
00:36:06,441 --> 00:36:09,777
Who is definitely a <i> Dirty </ i>?

519
00:36:18,751 --> 00:36:20,251
Jackman.

520
00:36:29,901 --> 00:36:31,101
Dylan.

521
00:36:34,798 --> 00:36:36,727
Hold this a moment.

522
00:36:38,922 --> 00:36:41,103
So it's eight in ...

523
00:36:41,303 --> 00:36:43,386
Well ... more than enough.

524
00:36:43,586 --> 00:36:45,086
Eight out of 62.

525
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:47,186
Take the end briefly.

526
00:36:47,575 --> 00:36:50,984
Here the theorem of Pythagoras would
we do come in handy.

527
00:36:52,535 --> 00:36:54,488
Go behind. What's the matter?

528
00:36:54,888 --> 00:36:56,388
Should we be doing this now?

529
00:36:56,588 --> 00:36:59,551
What? Measuring the school?
There is nothing wrong with that.

530
00:37:00,252 --> 00:37:02,093
But it looks bad.

531
00:37:04,461 --> 00:37:06,569
You're acting like a freak.

532
00:37:06,769 --> 00:37:08,369
What do you think they feel?

533
00:37:08,569 --> 00:37:10,852
We are dangerous
because we measure things?

534
00:37:11,052 --> 00:37:13,991
We look innocent.
- No, rather ridiculous.

535
00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:16,470
Nonetheless!
- We look strikingly out.

536
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:19,170
I look like <i> Encyclopedia Brown </ i>.

537
00:37:19,448 --> 00:37:21,216
How does this look to you like?

538
00:37:21,416 --> 00:37:23,014
You walk just past.

539
00:37:23,214 --> 00:37:24,771
Jared, what does this on?

540
00:37:24,971 --> 00:37:27,285
I measure something.
- Ok ?, but ...

541
00:37:27,485 --> 00:37:31,084
And I take a photo of it.
What does that look like?

542
00:37:31,284 --> 00:37:33,206
I measure your chest.
Is that dangerous?

543
00:37:34,531 --> 00:37:36,259
Does this look dangerous Chrissy?

544
00:37:36,459 --> 00:37:38,670
I measure Owen.
We are planning a school attack.

545
00:37:39,795 --> 00:37:41,537
Really? Amazing.

546
00:37:41,737 --> 00:37:44,990
<i> Shall we kill someone for you? </ i>
- Yes, Mr. Bird perhaps.

547
00:37:45,974 --> 00:37:48,176
Do you have commissioned
biology already created?

548
00:37:48,376 --> 00:37:51,350
Uh ... no really
not yet. You do?

549
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:54,744
Owen later she texted me.
Would you have them too?

550
00:37:54,944 --> 00:37:57,709
Yes please.
- Put your number in this.

551
00:38:03,857 --> 00:38:05,493
Good luck with your attack.

552
00:38:06,292 --> 00:38:09,017
Tell anyone though.
- I will not do.

553
00:38:12,293 --> 00:38:14,584
They talk.
We have lost her play.

554
00:38:14,984 --> 00:38:17,105
They must disappear.
She knows the whole plan.

555
00:38:17,305 --> 00:38:19,615
She has seen measuring me.
- Ok ?, I get it ...

556
00:38:19,815 --> 00:38:22,323
I even told her.

557
00:38:22,914 --> 00:38:25,037
She must die, damn it.

558
00:38:25,734 --> 00:38:28,342
We have to kill your girlfriend.
- I get the phone?

559
00:38:28,542 --> 00:38:32,998
How do I go texting her homework?
- No idea why she smashed it.

560
00:38:34,022 --> 00:38:35,845
Maybe she sees you just sit there?

561
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,980
Do you think?

562
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:42,021
Why would they agree otherwise with
texting homework?

563
00:38:43,252 --> 00:38:46,283
That certainly does not make sense.
- So we make homework ...

564
00:38:49,317 --> 00:38:50,734
I am fine.

565
00:38:52,766 --> 00:38:54,283
Why are you so wildly?

566
00:38:57,017 --> 00:38:59,121
I have it here somewhere.

567
00:39:02,353 --> 00:39:05,403
SMS Chrissy, and tell them you
call at nine o'clock.

568
00:39:05,603 --> 00:39:08,031
Why? What happens then?
- Just do it!

569
00:39:08,231 --> 00:39:09,731
That's Chrissy.
Are you done...?

570
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:12,677
Wait a second.
- With you ... Jesus.

571
00:39:20,003 --> 00:39:21,503
Hey?

572
00:39:24,587 --> 00:39:29,127
Sorry, I'm at a party.
With whom I speak?

573
00:39:33,555 --> 00:39:37,650
Sorry, I just find a quieter spot.
This party is just so noisy.

574
00:39:42,678 --> 00:39:45,701
No, no problem. Secondje.

575
00:39:55,552 --> 00:39:58,733
Hey? Ok ?, sorry Chrissy.
Do you understand me now?

576
00:40:00,381 --> 00:40:02,797
Ok ?, great. Where you called for?

577
00:40:07,814 --> 00:40:09,858
Right, the homework.

578
00:40:10,058 --> 00:40:12,557
I did a little work on it.

579
00:40:12,757 --> 00:40:15,462
It's just school, you know?
Nobody cares about.

580
00:40:17,593 --> 00:40:21,347
Just give what you have.
Then I can judge it.

581
00:40:31,773 --> 00:40:33,880
Do you <i> Do not Care High </ i> ever read?
- Yes.

582
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,230
Korman?
- Yes, with all that extra cabinets.

583
00:40:36,929 --> 00:40:38,730
Right, that guy is the baron of ...

584
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:40,430
Hi Owen.

585
00:40:41,331 --> 00:40:42,663
Did you see that?

586
00:40:44,771 --> 00:40:46,271
You got that?

587
00:40:47,727 --> 00:40:49,730
It is not so much to them "hi" said ...

588
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:52,180
... but they did it
in front of everybody.

589
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:55,899
This is not just a greeting
like when you meet someone.

590
00:40:56,099 --> 00:40:58,712
Everyone was there.
Do you understand how important that is?

591
00:40:58,912 --> 00:41:00,755
Yeah, ok ?, what do you think of this ...?

592
00:41:00,955 --> 00:41:03,000
I'm playing guitar in the hallway ...

593
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,019
... and if it passes,
I play a romantic song.

594
00:41:06,219 --> 00:41:08,849
She then goes on:
"Owen, what a good song!"

595
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:12,110
What are you talking about?
- Girls love guitar, right?

596
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:14,810
You sound as if I
I remember a bad plan.

597
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:18,857
That plan seems to make sense.
Are you a Spanish gangster or something?

598
00:41:19,057 --> 00:41:21,811
OK no problem.
Do you remember a good plan.

599
00:41:22,111 --> 00:41:24,379
I will do that.
- Give me one now.

600
00:41:24,579 --> 00:41:26,826
Wait till I get back
of my holiday.

601
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:29,909
The whole weekend?
I now need a plan.

602
00:41:30,109 --> 00:41:32,853
I can think of nothing immediately.
- Yes, do it!

603
00:41:33,053 --> 00:41:35,560
Wait three days ...
- Now give me immediately a plan.

604
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,308
Pest me now?

605
00:41:37,508 --> 00:41:39,554
I can not wait
until you get back.

606
00:41:39,754 --> 00:41:41,254
Let me come along.

607
00:41:42,231 --> 00:41:45,081
I just go there some weapons
firing with my cousin Nelson.

608
00:41:45,281 --> 00:41:48,391
Is that frightening
with his sunglasses?

609
00:41:49,051 --> 00:41:51,478
I like guns ...

610
00:42:15,855 --> 00:42:17,692
So you close your left eye ...

611
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:21,211
... and then you put the crosshairs right.

612
00:42:21,411 --> 00:42:23,137
What does it mean?

613
00:42:23,337 --> 00:42:27,474
Get that white
middle of that notch condition.

614
00:42:28,474 --> 00:42:32,210
Like this? I get the check
not in my face or something?

615
00:42:36,495 --> 00:42:39,232
At what sign?
Counting down from 50?

616
00:42:39,432 --> 00:42:40,932
Wow, <i> damn it! </ I>.

617
00:42:55,147 --> 00:42:56,147
Holy shit.

618
00:42:57,250 --> 00:43:00,700
Want one
past my head shaved?

619
00:43:01,994 --> 00:43:04,426
Just so I feel it?
- Ok ?.

620
00:43:04,826 --> 00:43:07,140
Never mind just skim over.

621
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:10,458
As if I passed on a bicycle.

622
00:43:12,619 --> 00:43:14,219
Hang on, I need a drink.

623
00:44:04,258 --> 00:44:05,758
Damn.

624
00:44:06,832 --> 00:44:08,358
Oh my God.

625
00:44:57,241 --> 00:44:58,741
You see?

626
00:45:02,728 --> 00:45:05,358
Oh my God. I hate you!

627
00:45:15,432 --> 00:45:17,932
Why do you do such a thing
if I start to trust you?

628
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:19,532
That's why I do not trust you.

629
00:45:19,732 --> 00:45:22,484
It's good to have someone at the same time
and can not be trusted.

630
00:45:24,854 --> 00:45:28,383
It's OK?.
According to Nelson does not matter.

631
00:45:28,583 --> 00:45:30,619
But where is Nelson?
- When the fire.

632
00:45:30,819 --> 00:45:33,464
Watch out. Here lies mud.

633
00:45:34,034 --> 00:45:36,624
Matt!
- Just come Owen.

634
00:45:36,924 --> 00:45:39,969
Is it really okay? we're here?
- Yes.

635
00:45:40,169 --> 00:45:41,980
Timid. Is this a friend of yours?

636
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:43,686
Yes, this is Scott.

637
00:45:43,886 --> 00:45:45,861
Nice to meet you.
- Hey Scott, I'm Matt.

638
00:45:48,437 --> 00:45:50,757
I do not know
whether it is ok? to wear it.

639
00:45:50,957 --> 00:45:52,357
This is my only jacket.

640
00:45:52,557 --> 00:45:55,939
I can take off him.
It was the only one we had.

641
00:45:56,139 --> 00:45:57,706
I know I
a chief corpse.

642
00:45:57,906 --> 00:46:02,189
My plan is now
to bake a cake at home.

643
00:46:02,389 --> 00:46:08,581
Owen then pretends
who has stolen from a cooking class.

644
00:46:08,781 --> 00:46:11,425
And then he put it to her
and he says:

645
00:46:11,625 --> 00:46:15,445
"Chrissy, I stole this cake,
You want a piece? "

646
00:46:15,645 --> 00:46:18,198
And then she thinks:
"Wow, what a tough guy."

647
00:46:18,398 --> 00:46:21,367
Do you think that works?
- I do not know...

648
00:46:21,567 --> 00:46:23,852
Cake Plan ...!
- I do not know if that works.

649
00:46:24,052 --> 00:46:26,508
It's rather corny.

650
00:46:26,708 --> 00:46:29,761
It sounds like a plan
such as in films.

651
00:46:29,961 --> 00:46:33,466
But that really works! It's not like
he immediately makes a proposal.

652
00:46:33,666 --> 00:46:35,134
I play guitar...

653
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:37,724
... just in general.

654
00:46:37,924 --> 00:46:41,163
I show her
I play guitar.

655
00:46:41,363 --> 00:46:42,771
And that you enjoy doing.

656
00:46:42,971 --> 00:46:45,627
Right.
- This shows exactly who you are.

657
00:46:45,827 --> 00:46:47,805
Right.
- That would be very cool.

658
00:46:48,005 --> 00:46:49,405
Better than the cake plan?
- Yes!

659
00:46:49,605 --> 00:46:51,098
If what they say ...

660
00:46:51,298 --> 00:46:54,253
... you just imagine
something to drink something.

661
00:46:54,453 --> 00:46:56,874
<i> - And otherwise it's not so bad.
- No really </ i>.

662
00:46:57,074 --> 00:46:58,481
<i> Nothing lost, nothing gained. </ i>

663
00:46:58,681 --> 00:47:01,331
Just do not creepy.
- I'm not creepy!

664
00:47:01,531 --> 00:47:05,493
The cake plan is creepy!
- Yeah, forget the cake plan.

665
00:47:05,693 --> 00:47:07,843
It comes down
you paranoid to do.

666
00:47:08,043 --> 00:47:10,284
You have to pretend
really is in trouble.

667
00:47:10,484 --> 00:47:13,375
That you're really screwed
if you can not sit down.

668
00:47:13,575 --> 00:47:16,563
So you say, "Hey Chrissy,
May I sit down? It is urgent!"

669
00:47:16,763 --> 00:47:20,562
"Damn, I stole this cake.
May I sit down? "

670
00:47:20,762 --> 00:47:23,062
Once you're in the right.
- I gotta sit down.

671
00:47:23,262 --> 00:47:29,648
Then you get to a point
where it just ... as a lunch date.

672
00:47:29,848 --> 00:47:31,865
Nothing.
And if it does not work ...

673
00:47:32,065 --> 00:47:34,665
... if you afwimpelt
go off when LeBron James.

674
00:47:34,865 --> 00:47:36,365
With flour ...

675
00:47:42,812 --> 00:47:45,362
I made this cake just
stolen from a cooking class.

676
00:47:46,528 --> 00:47:48,755
We need to eat him.
You feel like it?

677
00:47:48,955 --> 00:47:50,455
Puts you there.

678
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,210
I also have some forks
and signs on.

679
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:54,910
Beautiful.

680
00:47:55,310 --> 00:47:58,005
Wait a second.
Is someone else's cake?

681
00:47:58,205 --> 00:48:00,503
Yes, he was just standing there.

682
00:48:00,703 --> 00:48:03,116
So now goes down?
- Stop!

683
00:48:04,328 --> 00:48:07,167
Sorry, I have offended you?

684
00:48:07,567 --> 00:48:09,067
No.

685
00:48:10,522 --> 00:48:11,993
Birthdays?

686
00:48:12,193 --> 00:48:15,452
Evan has scored us a cake.
- It is Owen!

687
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,403
He's very nice.

688
00:48:20,603 --> 00:48:22,103
Yes, take it.

689
00:48:24,248 --> 00:48:27,283
Help yourself buddy.
- He CHT good?.

690
00:48:31,401 --> 00:48:33,982
What the hell was that?
- Why? It was amazing!

691
00:48:34,182 --> 00:48:36,634
What was that?
That was not the plan!

692
00:48:36,834 --> 00:48:38,245
Chrissy loved it.

693
00:48:38,445 --> 00:48:41,819
No man. You have the <i> Dirties </ i>
made cake!

694
00:48:42,155 --> 00:48:44,618
I've seen it!
You have given them cake!

695
00:48:44,818 --> 00:48:47,122
He was Chrissy
and she loved it ...

696
00:48:47,322 --> 00:48:50,691
Everyone loved it.
What's wrong with you?

697
00:48:54,128 --> 00:48:56,064
Chrissy liked it ...
- Verdomse idiot!

698
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:24,251
Exit ...

699
00:49:38,132 --> 00:49:40,052
We need to <i> Catcher in the Rye </ i> lend.

700
00:49:41,648 --> 00:49:43,848
It is funny
if we all take.

701
00:49:46,389 --> 00:49:49,140
If we take them all
we seem insane.

702
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:53,654
Six copies.
We'll take them all, all three.

703
00:49:53,854 --> 00:49:57,601
Why do we seem insane?
- Because it is funny!

704
00:49:59,381 --> 00:50:01,630
Come on, poseur.
- Ok ?.

705
00:50:07,556 --> 00:50:09,056
H ?, Owen.

706
00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:13,930
How are you?

707
00:50:14,230 --> 00:50:16,230
What does the word 'arbitrary'?

708
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:22,765
That means either a decision
for reasons that do not really matter ...

709
00:50:22,965 --> 00:50:26,353
... or by someone who has the right
did not have to make them.

710
00:50:27,361 --> 00:50:31,013
The decision was arbitrary.
It does not matter ...

711
00:50:31,213 --> 00:50:33,570
... and you had no right
to make them.

712
00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:35,683
Does that make sense?
- Yes.

713
00:50:36,083 --> 00:50:37,606
Ok ?.
- OK thanks.

714
00:50:40,489 --> 00:50:41,989
What was that?

715
00:50:42,189 --> 00:50:45,621
She asked you ...?
- She asked what "arbitrary" means.

716
00:50:45,821 --> 00:50:49,032
I explained her
and she thanked me.

717
00:50:49,232 --> 00:50:51,527
What an idiot. Is she
'Grapes of Wrath' reading?

718
00:50:51,727 --> 00:50:53,795
She does not know what "arbitrary" means?

719
00:50:54,095 --> 00:50:56,386
I'm going to tell her what
a bad definition that is.

720
00:50:56,686 --> 00:50:59,954
Define the better.
- Arbitrary?

721
00:51:00,958 --> 00:51:03,225
So many times I did not.

722
00:51:04,215 --> 00:51:08,750
What does the word 'arbitrary'?
- OK sorry. Arbitrary means ...

723
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:14,196
What does 'arbitrary'?
- It means...

724
00:51:14,396 --> 00:51:18,523
Arbitrary means
You know something, but ... no.

725
00:51:19,996 --> 00:51:22,671
I could not believe
you did something stupid.

726
00:51:23,215 --> 00:51:26,882
Why do you do such a thing even?

727
00:51:27,082 --> 00:51:31,293
It was not intentional.
I was just so concentrated.

728
00:51:35,159 --> 00:51:37,012
I was also upset.

729
00:51:38,245 --> 00:51:40,345
Then it goes on here ...
- Play it.

730
00:51:41,562 --> 00:51:44,563
You know this from when
we had that plan.

731
00:51:44,763 --> 00:51:47,544
I just have not seen it yet.

732
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:51,999
I have the dead
moments edited out.

733
00:51:52,199 --> 00:51:54,292
Well, how does this look?

734
00:51:58,409 --> 00:52:00,034
It looks fantastic.

735
00:52:00,234 --> 00:52:01,638
This is amazing.

736
00:52:01,838 --> 00:52:05,123
You have nothing
seen h ??

737
00:52:05,534 --> 00:52:09,064
That last scene
looks so absurd.

738
00:52:09,264 --> 00:52:12,514
Here, images of
on the bike you see.

739
00:52:21,889 --> 00:52:23,339
Look.

740
00:52:24,668 --> 00:52:27,140
What are they?
- Blueprints.

741
00:52:28,439 --> 00:52:29,839
How so?

742
00:52:32,051 --> 00:52:34,365
They are blueprints of the school.

743
00:52:34,565 --> 00:52:36,571
I had not told you yet.

744
00:52:36,771 --> 00:52:39,215
Why School?
- Yeah wait a minute.

745
00:52:39,415 --> 00:52:40,840
I'll show you.

746
00:52:41,995 --> 00:52:43,863
I put everything on it.

747
00:52:48,228 --> 00:52:52,270
Where each room has
and who uses them and stuff.

748
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:54,113
They are damn gigantic h ??

749
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:57,706
Look, I have the <i> Dirties </ i> put it.

750
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:01,303
And look, every room is labeled.

751
00:53:01,503 --> 00:53:02,903
The gym ...

752
00:53:04,171 --> 00:53:06,579
Mr. Macs class and Muldoon.

753
00:53:06,779 --> 00:53:10,445
Everything is on it.
The times and ... wait a minute.

754
00:53:13,218 --> 00:53:18,925
The leswissels where they usually
hang out and all cabinets.

755
00:53:19,125 --> 00:53:25,479
Then I have a separate sheet
especially for ... all the Dirties.

756
00:54:57,186 --> 00:54:58,873
... the first note, right?

757
00:54:59,922 --> 00:55:01,806
There, right on that note.

758
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:09,136
Yes, all together in one big ... ?? sentence.

759
00:55:11,915 --> 00:55:13,537
Sorry Mr. Bird, it will come.

760
00:55:13,737 --> 00:55:15,580
Yes, it is to succeed.

761
00:55:18,058 --> 00:55:19,458
Yes, like that.

762
00:55:22,627 --> 00:55:27,156
All at once. Not going back.
Wait, I'll show you something.

763
00:55:28,121 --> 00:55:31,583
It is a different language such as
speech, right?

764
00:55:31,783 --> 00:55:33,483
So we play a phrase.

765
00:55:33,683 --> 00:55:37,076
A sentence with a particular
rhythm and phonetics.

766
00:55:37,276 --> 00:55:38,676
So you're doing ...

767
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,756
You see?
- Yes, but it sounds better to you.

768
00:55:43,956 --> 00:55:46,165
You simply separate your hands.

769
00:55:46,365 --> 00:55:49,962
I want to be this morning.
It does not sound like you.

770
00:55:50,162 --> 00:55:51,828
Why? You have plenty of time.

771
00:55:52,028 --> 00:55:55,846
You have to practice every day,
but the girls will love it.

772
00:55:56,785 --> 00:55:59,341
How this guy called again?
Something with a D?

773
00:56:00,312 --> 00:56:01,778
Dylan?

774
00:56:02,930 --> 00:56:04,330
You do not know?

775
00:56:16,293 --> 00:56:19,326
Where did you get all those pictures come from?
- From footage.

776
00:56:19,815 --> 00:56:22,879
Oh, screenshots?
- Yes.

777
00:56:24,568 --> 00:56:26,398
Why?
- For the film.

778
00:56:26,598 --> 00:56:28,248
It's all the <i> Dirties </ i>.

779
00:56:28,848 --> 00:56:31,936
What if your mom sees them?
- That never comes here.

780
00:56:32,136 --> 00:56:34,214
When did her
here last?

781
00:56:34,414 --> 00:56:37,684
Even then she just looks
a lot of pictures.

782
00:56:37,884 --> 00:56:40,185
They might think it's for
is a film. That's it.

783
00:56:40,385 --> 00:56:44,744
When she asked about it would
I just say.

784
00:56:44,944 --> 00:56:47,606
<i> She would say, "I do not know
once why I asked, blah blah blah. "</ i>

785
00:56:47,806 --> 00:56:50,438
<i> "Steven, you know it already?
Matthew is bla bla bla ... "</ i>

786
00:56:50,638 --> 00:56:52,069
<i> She would not even say that. </ i>

787
00:56:52,269 --> 00:56:54,319
<i> "Ok ?, I leave for my work. Day!" </ i>

788
00:56:56,329 --> 00:56:58,830
Go tell her.
Go upstairs.

789
00:56:59,745 --> 00:57:02,549
"M-m Mrs. Johnson, uh ..."

790
00:57:02,749 --> 00:57:04,851
Mrs. Johnson, your son
is damn crazy ...

791
00:57:05,051 --> 00:57:08,472
He hang pictures on the wall
of people he wants to murder ...

792
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:12,937
Get the photos off or something ...
- No!

793
00:57:15,608 --> 00:57:18,422
Ok ?, I'm going home.
- What?

794
00:57:19,517 --> 00:57:21,009
Owen?
- <I> I'm going home </ i>.

795
00:57:59,279 --> 00:58:00,755
Tarantino!

796
00:58:01,362 --> 00:58:02,982
Cute haircut man.

797
00:58:03,182 --> 00:58:04,582
Excuse ...

798
00:58:05,474 --> 00:58:07,078
Look at him.

799
00:58:20,098 --> 00:58:22,846
This is like when <i> Snake Eyes
</ i> who made mistake ...

800
00:58:23,046 --> 00:58:24,744
Please do something back.

801
00:58:25,144 --> 00:58:26,820
Put the piece a minute but come ...

802
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:28,712
I need to do it here.

803
00:58:28,912 --> 00:58:30,812
Put ?? s step back.
This is madness.

804
00:58:31,012 --> 00:58:34,123
But that would not look so good.
- That does not matter now!

805
00:58:34,323 --> 00:58:36,610
Of course it out.
This is a movie!

806
00:58:37,857 --> 00:58:39,692
This is not a movie.
Just you and me.

807
00:58:39,892 --> 00:58:42,032
This is a film. Trust me.

808
00:58:43,115 --> 00:58:47,841
We'll go home and I'll show you ...
- It's sick how you behave!

809
00:58:48,041 --> 00:58:51,880
What do you mean?
- It is always a movie for you!

810
00:58:52,538 --> 00:58:54,080
It's pathetic!

811
00:58:55,108 --> 00:58:57,861
Why are you being so weird?
- I'm not weird!

812
00:58:58,061 --> 00:58:59,788
You conducted your very strange ...

813
00:59:00,919 --> 00:59:02,955
I take a step forward and ...

814
00:59:03,155 --> 00:59:05,144
This is exactly what I mean!

815
00:59:06,775 --> 00:59:09,735
You're upset
and I try to calm down and I say:

816
00:59:09,935 --> 00:59:11,335
"Listen, Owen, calm ..."

817
00:59:11,535 --> 00:59:15,180
It does not care if you
a good scene would find in your film ...

818
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:17,626
It's Danny Glover in <i> Royal Tenenbaums </ i>.

819
00:59:18,381 --> 00:59:20,463
"I do not know, Percy, she's ..."

820
00:59:20,863 --> 00:59:22,263
Shut up!

821
00:59:22,463 --> 00:59:23,863
Shut up!

822
00:59:26,274 --> 00:59:29,350
I do not find it funny,
So who do you do it?

823
00:59:33,263 --> 00:59:36,493
Is this about Chrissy?
- What does this have to do with Chrissy?

824
00:59:36,693 --> 00:59:39,799
No idea. I do not think
I've done something wrong.

825
00:59:39,999 --> 00:59:41,399
You act!

826
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:45,234
You do that all the time.
- I never do!

827
00:59:45,434 --> 00:59:47,184
Even now you're acting!

828
00:59:47,384 --> 00:59:49,234
I do not know anymore
what else is real to you.

829
00:59:49,434 --> 00:59:51,122
This is real. I really do!

830
00:59:52,196 --> 00:59:53,622
I really do ...

831
00:59:53,822 --> 00:59:56,868
I'm standing on a cliff
I want to record a scene which is real!

832
00:59:57,068 --> 01:00:01,132
Not if you Kung Fu and the passes
and the voices do with it ...

833
01:00:01,332 --> 01:00:04,498
Yeah, calm! This is ridiculous.

834
01:00:04,698 --> 01:00:07,536
Now, however, is suitable
to the scene to terminate them.

835
01:00:07,736 --> 01:00:10,002
Well, <i> cut </ i>.
From there then.

836
01:01:17,057 --> 01:01:20,006
Do not mess with me!
- Come on, turn again.

837
01:01:26,686 --> 01:01:28,230
Get the fuck down!
Down I say!

838
01:01:49,948 --> 01:01:51,389
Funny, h ??

839
01:01:51,589 --> 01:01:55,761
If you see yourself on video ...

840
01:01:57,663 --> 01:02:01,159
... it seems ... another person.

841
01:02:01,359 --> 01:02:02,783
Loopy ...

842
01:02:10,953 --> 01:02:13,218
Sweatpants are
out of fashion, Jackman.

843
01:02:16,835 --> 01:02:20,151
Yo! That is my line.

844
01:02:23,032 --> 01:02:27,118
The Gahooley: "Jogging Pants are
out of fashion, Jackman. "

845
01:02:29,233 --> 01:02:33,139
You have about 45 minutes.
- Before the storm starts?

846
01:02:41,710 --> 01:02:45,672
Hopefully, the storm does not blow as hard
if your mother yesterday.

847
01:02:46,233 --> 01:02:47,633
What?

848
01:02:47,833 --> 01:02:49,272
You heard me.

849
01:02:49,472 --> 01:02:51,422
What? The storm blows ...?

850
01:02:52,020 --> 01:02:53,593
Yes, you heard me.

851
01:02:53,793 --> 01:02:56,543
It can give me some.
We come your murder with guns.

852
01:02:56,743 --> 01:02:58,143
Do you know?
- Yes.

853
01:02:58,343 --> 01:03:00,430
We will shoot you.
- No, not yet.

854
01:03:00,630 --> 01:03:02,030
He's still not telling.

855
01:03:03,179 --> 01:03:06,070
Therefore you are wimps.
- You're dead ...

856
01:03:06,270 --> 01:03:07,816
You do not come up for yourself.

857
01:03:08,016 --> 01:03:11,099
I have just explained so!
- Come on, stop ...

858
01:03:13,651 --> 01:03:15,430
This is madness!

859
01:03:16,293 --> 01:03:18,523
Owen, this sounds familiar?

860
01:03:19,023 --> 01:03:20,923
"Joy, sadness, fear, fun ..."

861
01:03:21,523 --> 01:03:23,473
"... can all be imitated."

862
01:03:23,873 --> 01:03:27,698
"He knows the expressions, intonation
and body language. "

863
01:03:28,098 --> 01:03:29,998
"He can not just light on ..."

864
01:03:30,198 --> 01:03:32,798
"... his whole life
?? is a big scam. "

865
01:03:33,298 --> 01:03:35,598
"His personality is completely
invented ... "

866
01:03:35,798 --> 01:03:37,898
"... to deceive people."

867
01:03:38,098 --> 01:03:42,587
"Psychopaths are proud
their deceit ... "

868
01:03:42,787 --> 01:03:44,392
"... and share the fun."

869
01:03:44,592 --> 01:03:47,025
"Lying is their profession."

870
01:03:47,225 --> 01:03:50,700
"Even if the truth is sufficient,
they lie to the sport. "

871
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:53,030
This is exactly what you said about me.

872
01:03:54,516 --> 01:03:56,266
Who are you calling?

873
01:03:58,382 --> 01:03:59,476
Nobody.

874
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:07,257
Did you hear me?
I could be a psychopath.

875
01:04:10,069 --> 01:04:12,402
Owen, I am perhaps a psychopath!

876
01:04:17,322 --> 01:04:18,972
Who you texting?
What are you doing?

877
01:04:19,172 --> 01:04:20,822
This man is crazy!

878
01:04:22,416 --> 01:04:23,543
<i> You do not laugh once. </ i>

879
01:04:23,743 --> 01:04:25,293
I'm tired of this.

880
01:04:25,493 --> 01:04:27,093
Let's do something else.

881
01:04:27,293 --> 01:04:28,293
<i> What do you mean something else? </ i>

882
01:04:28,493 --> 01:04:30,093
I do not know, a video game?

883
01:04:30,593 --> 01:04:32,393
Or <i> Magic </ i> play cards.

884
01:04:33,144 --> 01:04:36,396
Can you not care
I might be a psychopath?

885
01:04:36,596 --> 01:04:39,781
<i> I'm not going to play this game. </ i>
- What game?

886
01:04:39,981 --> 01:04:44,023
You're a coward but
you do your tough love before.

887
01:04:44,223 --> 01:04:45,794
You're the one
these tough trying to do!

888
01:04:45,994 --> 01:04:48,629
Very texting time with
some hot chick.

889
01:04:48,829 --> 01:04:51,379
I try to put a monkey.
You're the wimp!

890
01:04:51,579 --> 01:04:53,743
No! You're a coward!

891
01:04:54,484 --> 01:04:57,843
You talk tough but does nothing.
That makes you a wimp!

892
01:04:58,043 --> 01:05:01,343
I make myself at least not wise
that a girl sees me sit ...

893
01:05:01,543 --> 01:05:05,145
... while she does not care about me!
It is a silly goose!

894
01:05:05,545 --> 01:05:08,595
The only reason she sees you
Thanks to my plan!

895
01:05:08,795 --> 01:05:10,364
You do not know what you're talking about!
- Anyway!

896
01:05:10,564 --> 01:05:12,248
No. anyway.
- I know that!

897
01:05:12,948 --> 01:05:16,000
You're nobody!
You're nothing without me!

898
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:17,991
I'm your only friend!

899
01:05:18,191 --> 01:05:19,448
I'm your only friend!

900
01:05:19,648 --> 01:05:22,869
You always pretend
you have to say ...

901
01:05:23,069 --> 01:05:27,170
... but no one likes you
and nobody wants to deal with you!

902
01:05:27,370 --> 01:05:29,827
And if you're really upset
you react it off on me!

903
01:05:30,027 --> 01:05:33,085
Then you get mad about that girl
where you're jealous.

904
01:05:33,285 --> 01:05:35,985
You're jealous of the only person
who sees me standing!

905
01:05:36,185 --> 01:05:38,410
<i> I'm not jealous!
She's stupid! </ I>

906
01:05:38,610 --> 01:05:40,749
I want my best friend
not see embitter his life!

907
01:05:40,949 --> 01:05:42,669
Why start over
if you do not care?

908
01:05:42,869 --> 01:05:46,492
You're jealous!
You have no friends ...

909
01:05:46,692 --> 01:05:48,196
... and you do it to yourself!

910
01:05:48,396 --> 01:05:51,096
I do not count on it.
You know it's true!

911
01:05:55,175 --> 01:05:56,901
Fuck you! Get out!

912
01:05:57,101 --> 01:05:58,801
For me it does not.

913
01:07:59,848 --> 01:08:02,222
Is it too corny?

914
01:08:03,438 --> 01:08:05,737
This is nothing to me h ??

915
01:08:06,538 --> 01:08:08,038
Do such a thing ...

916
01:09:08,859 --> 01:09:10,857
Die, dirty bastard!

917
01:09:11,057 --> 01:09:13,508
Is that scary?
If I come out?

918
01:09:13,908 --> 01:09:16,270
The yellow glove
looks menacing.

919
01:09:16,470 --> 01:09:20,770
I do not know why.
This is just perfect for a murder.

920
01:09:20,970 --> 01:09:23,269
It looks like <i> The Cleaner </ i>.

921
01:09:26,875 --> 01:09:29,400
"Now my glove
under the blood! "

922
01:09:30,814 --> 01:09:32,427
This shirt is perhaps neon.

923
01:09:32,627 --> 01:09:34,677
My extended family as bears ...

924
01:09:37,588 --> 01:09:39,138
Is that weird?

925
01:09:40,582 --> 01:09:43,292
You have to imagine
under the bloodstains.

926
01:09:48,507 --> 01:09:51,757
Do I sometimes mad at you?
- Why? Who thinks you're crazy?

927
01:09:51,957 --> 01:09:53,457
I do not know...

928
01:09:55,054 --> 01:09:58,287
<i> I seem not mad, are you? </ i>
- No, you're not crazy.

929
01:09:58,487 --> 01:10:02,189
You sometimes does say crazy things.
I do not know why you do that.

930
01:10:02,389 --> 01:10:05,988
Just before the show, I think.
- That Owen thinks.

931
01:10:06,188 --> 01:10:07,738
Well, what are you doing?

932
01:10:08,252 --> 01:10:10,152
This is just out of the blue.

933
01:10:10,352 --> 01:10:13,002
So just without any context.

934
01:10:13,202 --> 01:10:14,402
From where is that?

935
01:10:14,602 --> 01:10:16,402
I do not know.
I thought there normally.

936
01:10:16,602 --> 01:10:18,152
I read a book about ...

937
01:10:18,552 --> 01:10:20,352
Well, what does it mean
to be crazy?

938
01:10:20,552 --> 01:10:25,952
Technically, you were not
know what is real and what is not.

939
01:10:26,752 --> 01:10:28,352
That means to be crazy.

940
01:10:30,434 --> 01:10:32,734
If you have a grip
on reality.

941
01:10:37,882 --> 01:10:39,932
You're a bit of a wild ...

942
01:10:42,084 --> 01:10:45,887
I'm just wondering
where that comes from.

943
01:10:46,087 --> 01:10:48,437
I do not know.
- Think you're crazy?

944
01:10:48,637 --> 01:10:50,537
No, I do not think so.

945
01:10:51,637 --> 01:10:53,537
I do not even know why I ask.

946
01:11:24,456 --> 01:11:26,506
I had to
my notebooks burn ...

947
01:11:53,056 --> 01:11:57,119
It must have likely
tuck yourself ... in the end.

948
01:12:00,281 --> 01:12:01,831
I export them, but ...

949
01:12:36,561 --> 01:12:39,111
Are you a student?
- Yeah, I'm just a little earlier.

950
01:12:39,311 --> 01:12:41,311
Come in.
- Thanks man.

951
01:14:42,242 --> 01:14:43,792
H ?, Josh ...

952
01:15:25,263 --> 01:15:29,263
You're here early.
- It is a project for Mr. Muldoon.

953
01:15:29,763 --> 01:15:32,213
Wow. Good luck!

954
01:17:20,486 --> 01:17:22,895
Josh, huh? ...
- Look who's here.

955
01:17:27,790 --> 01:17:29,540
Let go of my hand guy.

956
01:17:35,217 --> 01:17:36,817
Jogging Pants are out of fashion.

957
01:17:37,017 --> 01:17:39,167
It's all right.
I'm just here for the bad guys!

958
01:17:39,367 --> 01:17:40,867
Owen?

959
01:17:43,931 --> 01:17:45,481
Owen!

960
01:17:45,681 --> 01:17:47,281
<i> Come, come, out of here! </ i>

961
01:17:47,681 --> 01:17:49,631
Owen!
<i> - Get out of here </ i>

962
01:17:50,571 --> 01:17:52,321
Come on! Down the stairs!

963
01:17:54,289 --> 01:17:55,689
Good heavens.

964
01:17:55,912 --> 01:17:57,462
Owen!

965
01:17:57,862 --> 01:17:59,362
Owen!

966
01:18:02,497 --> 01:18:03,997
Owen!

967
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:06,940
Damn.

968
01:18:24,432 --> 01:18:26,832
What are you doing now? It's me!
