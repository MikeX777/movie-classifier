1
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:07,901
It was when summer
was almost over.

2
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:11,200
It was rainin'
a hell of a lot.

3
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:26,476
Do you also fix
broken things?

4
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:28,955
I can fix anythin' except

5
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:30,390
makin' a hag into a maiden.

6
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:35,089
Then could you
fix this, too?

7
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:39,698
Oh my, you must pack
a big punch down there.

8
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:41,668
How hard could
you have peed

9
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:45,365
to break that steel
bedpan into pieces?

10
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:55,176
When I arrived at her home
to bring the fixed bedpan,

11
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:57,150
the rain suddenly stopped.

12
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,981
Hello?

13
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:06,348
Anybody home?

14
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:17,797
Hello?

15
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,339
Who's there?

16
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:23,376
Yes, it's me, the blacksmith
you visited down below.

17
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:27,403
How much did you
say it cost?

18
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,983
Man, I'm so darn coldafter

19
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,619
gettin' drenched out there.

20
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:34,254
A drink is better than

21
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:39,749
any money if you
got any booze.

22
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:48,866
Don't know if a young maiden living
alone like me would have any.

23
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:53,373
I did buy some raw rice wine
to make vinegar two days ago.

24
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,534
But where could it be?

25
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,437
Could it be there?

26
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:03,311
Where could it be?

27
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,915
Here?

28
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:09,656
There?

29
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:11,317
Or here?

30
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:14,325
Where could it be?

31
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:17,690
Where is it?

32
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:21,131
Where could it be?

33
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:28,932
Oh boy, her tight butt looked
like it was gonna burst.

34
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:32,402
I just wanted to sink
my teeth into it.

35
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,285
- What?
- What the hell?

36
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:41,515
What happened next?

37
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:43,289
- Hurry up.
- Quickly.

38
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:45,525
Tell us!

39
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:47,459
- Then she...
- Shut up!

40
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,632
You low class bastards.

41
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:57,926
I can't concentrate, damn it!

42
00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:05,966
What? "Low class bastards"?

43
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:08,942
What? And they aren't?

44
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,948
You low class bastards.

45
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:09,097
Try some taffy! Taffy!

46
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:14,036
I got taffy a young widow likes
to eat on a lonely night!

47
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:19,118
Taffy that's as white
as a baby's thigh.

48
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:21,187
If you have taffy white
as a baby's thigh...

49
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:23,456
Then got one as big as
my pecker?

50
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:28,086
I got all sizes, some even
big as a palace crossbeam.

51
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:35,462
The sun's falling over the mountain,
and this taffy is running out fast

52
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:38,538
This booze isn't just booze

53
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:39,572
Drink!

54
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:42,275
It's a potion to make
you live forever.

55
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:44,766
Now, come and drink.

56
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:49,549
- Try out a few sips.
- Can I use my two nuts as tab?

57
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:52,382
Depending on the nuts.

58
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:54,721
If the piece is solid,
drink for free.

59
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:55,988
Thief!

60
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:57,148
Catch him!

61
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:37,328
- Taffy! Come buy some taffy!
- Watch where you put your hand!

62
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:41,234
Don't just salivate,
come buy some taffy now.

63
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,935
I'm gonna break your wrists!

64
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:47,429
Lady, have some taffy.
Test it out.

65
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:51,543
Come here.
Hey, you have to pay first!

66
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:56,708
- What the hell?
- Oh my, I'm sorry.

67
00:06:58,117 --> 00:07:00,585
- What are you looking at?
- You little...

68
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:02,188
I oughta...

69
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:03,951
Let's go.

70
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,388
You're lucky
I'm a busy man today.

71
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:55,447
Money!

72
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:59,458
Money!

73
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:03,095
Protect the wagon!

74
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:04,687
Money!

75
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:07,196
Money!

76
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:11,065
Protect the money!

77
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:12,386
I'm a police officer!

78
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,760
Freeze!

79
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:33,076
Do or die.

80
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,878
Do or die.

81
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:41,814
Do or die.

82
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:48,153
I mean, if you surrender,
I'll let you alive!

83
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:52,398
So put that thing down fast

84
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:54,798
and be a good boy.

85
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:22,289
I knew you'd do that.
I knew!

86
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:24,846
Don't let a single sack go!

87
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:26,521
That way!

88
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:10,965
Gross!

89
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,572
Ouch, that hurt.

90
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:48,563
What blockhead bumped into me?

91
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,714
Who the hell?

92
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:58,547
Me? I'm nothin' special.

93
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:00,616
I'm just Detective Namsoon!

94
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:17,728
Now you're completely surrounded.

95
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:36,746
What's a crazy bitch
like you doin' here?

96
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,847
Go.

97
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,281
I said go.

98
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:51,519
I said go.

99
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:58,429
Go.

100
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:02,174
I said go.

101
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:03,869
I said go!

102
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:07,841
- Where is he?
- Yes?

103
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,148
I said where is he?

104
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,638
Where's who?

105
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:14,786
Want a taste of a bitch
who's really lost her mind?

106
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:16,014
Where is he?

107
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:17,723
The bald guy with
an eye patch.

108
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:19,625
The short, fast-walking one.

109
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,115
He's the one you're
looking for, right?

110
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:23,018
You know him, too. Right?

111
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:24,287
Pardon?

112
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:25,664
See?

113
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:30,569
Now he puts his tail down since
we're talking nice to him.

114
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:33,470
Use your mouth not your
fist next time.

115
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:35,630
He's human, not a beast.

116
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,173
So beating him won't
make him listen!

117
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:42,873
Oh my! How could you do
this to him?

118
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:44,710
Anyway,

119
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:47,152
he came this way,
so where could he have gone?

120
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:49,143
In the toilet? In the well?

121
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:51,649
On the roof?

122
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,155
Well, mind if I ask you
who you are?

123
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:58,355
Come on, don't need to
be scared!

124
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:01,258
We're not out to check IDs
for prostitutes,

125
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,902
nor or we out to find liquor
illegally stashed away.

126
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:05,270
So don't be scared.

127
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,139
Just quickly tell us
where he is.

128
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:10,142
We'll go quietly
like a silent fart,

129
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:11,977
without you asking us to.

130
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:14,411
All I know is that
his name is Eel.

131
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:16,144
That's right.

132
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:21,386
That bastard is so fast he slips
away like an eel all the time.

133
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:25,345
Well, his real name can't be Eel,
so what is it?

134
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:29,728
You should know already that
Ma is one vicious guy.

135
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:33,027
If I open my mouth, he'll stab me!
So I can't tell you!

136
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:38,561
Hey, you're trying to send
me to Hell, too?

137
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:42,975
I'd like to settle
things if we can.

138
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:44,443
So what's his name?

139
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:45,808
Ma the Lizard?

140
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:47,946
So he must run
as fast as a lizard.

141
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:49,381
Where does he live?

142
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:51,611
Where he eats and shits
all the time.

143
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,745
Right, okay.

144
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:54,953
And from there?

145
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:56,443
I know the rest.

146
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,997
I've seen a lot of
fast fighters,

147
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:45,159
but I haven't seen anyone
as fast as him.

148
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:47,572
There's a saying that
someone poked a thorn

149
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:49,699
out of a speeding tiger's paw.

150
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:52,442
I guess that kind of person
really exists.

151
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:26,712
Unfortunately, we haven't
found any clues

152
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:29,909
to the counterfeit incident
that erupted today.

153
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:32,517
All probable suspects

154
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:36,009
were killed by that masked man
who popped up and vanished.

155
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:38,824
Since not a single person
was able to

156
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:40,314
get a good look at his face,

157
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:44,120
it's currently difficult to draw
his picture montage.

158
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:48,255
This was picked up in the market
during the day.

159
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,965
Take a good look at them.

160
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:05,074
At first glance,
they look like real money.

161
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:19,030
If you take a closer look,
the engraving is very rough.

162
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:22,067
That can happen if the
heating is not right.

163
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,468
Although it's a hunch,
I think...

164
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:24,436
It's really strange.

165
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:25,437
They're not just a few coins...

166
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:26,638
But there are tons...

167
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:27,706
Of fake money circulating...

168
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:29,708
In the capital city...

169
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,276
So something's up.

170
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:35,440
First, make sure that none
of this leaks out and causes havoc.

171
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:37,816
Make a montage of at least
half of that

172
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:39,851
masked man's face, spread it,

173
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:42,877
and probe around in secret.

174
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:45,749
Then something will
eventually come up.

175
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:51,085
Who the hell,
and for what reason

176
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:55,096
did this person fake
so many coins?

177
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:37,209
There's a shitload of fake
money goin' around.

178
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:39,700
Prices are gonna
reach sky-high.

179
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:42,280
I had a bulk of money,

180
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,874
but all I could buy
were some eggs.

181
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,618
But I heard the money
looks real.

182
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:48,286
My money-lovin' big brother

183
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:50,989
can't even tell if it's
real or not anymore.

184
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,491
can I even do business

185
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:55,060
if I don't know
what money's real?

186
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,996
Fake money's all over the place,
even in my Choonchung Province.

187
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:00,897
Think that's all? Haejoo,
Kaesung, Anhdong, Namwon.

188
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:03,557
They're all over the country.

189
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:05,403
If this keeps up,

190
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:08,338
this damn country
will go belly up.

191
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:16,380
I still have the right to
speak my mind.

192
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:19,346
Son of a bitch,
what's he staring at?

193
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,622
Oh my, leaving already?

194
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:34,264
Was it tasty?

195
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:37,035
Hey, this money is fake!

196
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,637
How dare you accuse me!

197
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:40,405
I just got this money
after selling something.

198
00:25:40,405 --> 00:25:42,669
Take a good look at it.

199
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:46,344
Can't you read
the official seal?

200
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:49,245
You can't even read at all.

201
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:51,416
Yeah, I can't read, so what?

202
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:53,350
Anyway, I can't take
this money!

203
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:56,578
Can I take a quick look at it?

204
00:26:02,627 --> 00:26:06,731
Oh my, how can a young boy
like you be so darn pretty?

205
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:09,996
If only you weren't a boy,
I'd have some great fun with you.

206
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:15,804
Oh my, how could
your hands be so soft?

207
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,577
Oh, how wonderful.

208
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:29,187
If you were younger than me,
you'd already be dead.

209
00:26:29,187 --> 00:26:31,451
Scram!

210
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,681
And your voice is even pretty.

211
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:47,804
I'm gonna crush your balls!

212
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:50,709
Oh no!

213
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:52,939
Namsoon!

214
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:54,479
The money's real!

215
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:58,745
I can never leave you
alone for even a minute!

216
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:01,882
I bet it hurts a lot.

217
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:03,288
Let me take a look.

218
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,085
Ouch!

219
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:24,100
Each person died from
a single strike.

220
00:27:24,275 --> 00:27:25,877
I also found out that

221
00:27:25,877 --> 00:27:28,345
the dead prosecutors are fakes.

222
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:33,379
Oh boy, fake money circulates,

223
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:36,450
and now fake
prosecutors are in it.

224
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:40,887
Goodness, the whole world is
filled with fakes.

225
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:44,153
You're not fake so
don't worry.

226
00:27:45,864 --> 00:27:47,627
Hermit Gongan...

227
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:52,398
Remember?

228
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:56,207
Only Hermit Gongan
could make a fake

229
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:58,573
prosecutor's seal like that.

230
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:00,278
Isn't he in Surin Jail?

231
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:01,836
As far as I know,

232
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:05,810
someone paid big money
to bail him out.

233
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:07,348
Is that so?

234
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:52,723
Are you absolutely sure
you can protect me?

235
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:56,965
We'll even cover the money
for your paintings.

236
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:05,710
Is he the one who visited you
at Surin Jail a month ago?

237
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:07,075
Yes, sir.

238
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,983
His eyes looked quite sad.

239
00:29:30,835 --> 00:29:33,304
You sure you got
a good look at him?

240
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:35,874
That Sad Eyes
or whatever guy?

241
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:38,343
I did! This is where
he vanished.

242
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:40,573
There's nowhere else to go.

243
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,778
But you know where we are,
don't you?

244
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:48,953
The powerful Defense Minister,

245
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:50,784
who can even stop
a bird from flyin'.

246
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:52,579
That Minister Song
whatever's home.

247
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:54,659
Why'd a powerful official like

248
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:58,096
him hang around those rotten crooks?

249
00:29:58,096 --> 00:29:59,197
That's so you.

250
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:01,132
You don't have much of a brain.

251
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:04,192
That's why you were
never promoted.

252
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:09,668
What did you bring that up for?
That's complete nonsense.

253
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,144
I just like to sweat
on the job.

254
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:16,477
It means that I like
being out on the scene.

255
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:21,617
Well, sometimes you
can be right.

256
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:26,257
But I still don't buy

257
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:27,986
what you said.

258
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:29,990
It's really iffy.

259
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:43,575
Corvina fish and
Ambrosia casserole!

260
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:46,476
Oh my, it looks so tasty!

261
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:52,505
But nothin' exciting
is happening.

262
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:09,495
Is that Sad Eyes?

263
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,336
Don't get too close to him.

264
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:12,462
It's not time yet.

265
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:07,879
Oh goodness, my belly!

266
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,244
Where are you hurt?

267
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:10,778
Stomachaches...

268
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:48,975
Sir, are you following me
because you like me?

269
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,860
Are you chasing after me?

270
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:11,893
Don't know what you're saying.

271
00:36:14,205 --> 00:36:15,399
Or...

272
00:36:16,774 --> 00:36:18,332
Are you tailing me?

273
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:42,698
Oh goodness!

274
00:40:44,308 --> 00:40:46,544
Where've you been
all this time?

275
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:48,879
Trailed the fallen
leaves to here?

276
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:51,749
Or were you drunken
by the perfume?

277
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:56,186
Or were you possessed
by the night?

278
00:41:27,718 --> 00:41:29,049
No one saw us, right?

279
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,915
- Yes, sir!
- Let's go.

280
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:30,211
I swear it was the Defense Minister's
old assistant, Gu Jang-gon.

281
00:42:30,581 --> 00:42:31,715
I clearly remember

282
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:34,552
because I served
under Minister Song

283
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:35,920
in the last war.

284
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,889
They're smarter
than I thought.

285
00:42:39,089 --> 00:42:41,125
They installed bellows
in the boat,

286
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:44,151
made the fake coins while
riding in the canal,

287
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,488
and also distribute them.

288
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,899
The Defense Minister's
assistant, you say.

289
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:56,535
These are the fake coins gathered
in Pyongyang and Hamheung.

290
00:43:01,645 --> 00:43:03,447
Money is also useless there,

291
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:05,312
and prices have skyrocketed.

292
00:43:05,516 --> 00:43:07,814
Sir, shall we bring
in Gu Jang-gon first?

293
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:25,102
You scared the hell out of me!

294
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:27,593
Where the hell have you been?

295
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:33,243
Anyway, are you alright?

296
00:43:33,243 --> 00:43:34,478
Sir,

297
00:43:34,478 --> 00:43:36,639
it's impossible to produce the
counterfeits in huge sums

298
00:43:36,847 --> 00:43:39,283
without aid from
the dignitaries.

299
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:40,517
Since Defense Minister Song

300
00:43:40,517 --> 00:43:43,587
controls the entire military
and has no rivals,

301
00:43:43,587 --> 00:43:46,223
I'm sure he's
behind everything.

302
00:43:46,223 --> 00:43:49,493
Who are you to shoot off
your mouth like that?

303
00:43:49,493 --> 00:43:51,795
Please let Detective Ahn
and me go into Minister Song's home.

304
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:53,956
We will definitely
find evidence.

305
00:43:55,699 --> 00:43:57,201
You have good intentions,

306
00:43:57,201 --> 00:44:00,204
but we could fall first
if we're too hasty.

307
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:01,501
But sir!

308
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,123
Why aren't you sleeping?

309
00:44:20,357 --> 00:44:23,349
Are you trying to put me
on a skewer or something?

310
00:44:23,694 --> 00:44:28,290
You know that you're done for
if you weaken before a fight, right?

311
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:31,101
A fight only comes
one time around.

312
00:44:31,101 --> 00:44:32,625
There's no second chance.

313
00:45:27,825 --> 00:45:31,261
That's Minister Song's
old assistant, Gu Jang-gon.

314
00:46:19,209 --> 00:46:22,576
Your Excellency,
I wish you a happy birthday.

315
00:46:23,213 --> 00:46:27,684
This a famous sword brought
over from Japan.

316
00:46:27,684 --> 00:46:31,620
It was made for the Prime Minister
during the Muromachi era.

317
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:36,255
They also say that a curse
comes with this sword.

318
00:46:36,693 --> 00:46:40,754
According to its curse,
the sword's maker was executed.

319
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:43,125
The Prime Minister,
who held this sword,

320
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:45,697
was eventually assassinated
by his men.

321
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:50,107
The sword disappeared for
centuries and was then found

322
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:52,769
at the Prime Minister's grave.

323
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:56,814
Strangely, it wasn't rusted
and was perfectly in tact.

324
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:59,483
Quite an interesting sword.

325
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:01,585
A sword like

326
00:47:01,585 --> 00:47:03,954
that suits the
Minister perfectly!

327
00:47:03,954 --> 00:47:06,156
Yes indeed!

328
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:07,925
They say those

329
00:47:07,925 --> 00:47:11,595
kinds of swords become
a lucky sword to powerful men.

330
00:47:11,595 --> 00:47:14,120
Of course.

331
00:47:14,398 --> 00:47:15,699
Nazukusa.

332
00:47:15,699 --> 00:47:19,135
Zuwamonodomoka Yumenoato.

333
00:47:20,037 --> 00:47:25,600
The summer grass, traces of
a vanished warrior's dream.

334
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:50,934
Jeez, I guess this
ain't the toilet.

335
00:47:50,934 --> 00:47:54,304
Oh boy, this place is
as big as a palace.

336
00:47:54,304 --> 00:47:55,839
I was told the way,

337
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:58,774
but I can't find the toilet.

338
00:48:04,581 --> 00:48:07,778
Oh my, I peed on myself.

339
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:11,612
You all scared me to death.

340
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:29,006
Your Excellency,

341
00:48:29,006 --> 00:48:32,142
could we see an example
of the sword's power here?

342
00:48:32,142 --> 00:48:34,678
Great idea!

343
00:48:34,678 --> 00:48:37,078
Yes, please show us!

344
00:49:40,844 --> 00:49:42,835
Strike me if you like.

345
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:49,318
If you don't trust me.

346
00:51:59,316 --> 00:52:00,417
Your Excellency!

347
00:52:00,417 --> 00:52:02,619
How about giving him
this girl as a prize?

348
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:04,121
That's a great idea!

349
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:06,123
Your loyal henchman

350
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:09,392
seems to be very interested
in this girl.

351
00:52:09,392 --> 00:52:12,062
Hurry and pour him a drink!

352
00:52:12,062 --> 00:52:15,930
Drinks aren't important now!
She better go wash up first!

353
00:53:44,287 --> 00:53:45,845
Oh no!

354
00:54:13,516 --> 00:54:14,818
What is your name?

355
00:54:14,818 --> 00:54:16,683
Nam! Namsoon...

356
00:54:19,122 --> 00:54:21,056
I mean, Sweet Flower Moon.

357
00:54:22,392 --> 00:54:24,326
Then what's your name?

358
00:54:26,663 --> 00:54:28,324
Sir...

359
