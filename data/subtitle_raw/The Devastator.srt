1
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:03,803
(slow tense music)

2
00:00:03,803 --> 00:00:06,740
(helicopter whirs)

3
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:11,711
(weapons fire)

4
00:00:17,484 --> 00:00:19,986
(men chatter)

5
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:28,695
(Deacon groans)

6
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:33,299
(soldiers chatter
 in foreign language)

7
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:37,037
(weapons fire)

8
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,483
(soldier screams)

9
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:38,131
(soldier yells)

10
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:33,453
(mid-tempo lively music)

11
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:36,122
(water gurgles)

12
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:40,193
(kettle whistles)

13
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:19,933
(Deacon groans)

14
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:22,435
(phone rings)

15
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:25,572
- Hello?

16
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:26,406
- [Elaine] Deac?

17
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:28,575
- Elaine, how are you?

18
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:30,510
How's that washed-up
husband of yours doing?

19
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,312
- [Elaine] Marty, well,

20
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:33,613
that's what I was
 calling about, Deac.

21
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:35,615
I just don't know what to do.

22
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:37,083
Marty had an accident, he's--

23
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,451
- What is it?

24
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:40,119
- [Elaine] Dead,
  Deac, a car wreck.

25
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:41,754
- A car wreck, when?

26
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:43,256
- [Elaine] Two weeks ago.

27
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:46,192
That's what the sheriff's
  calling it, a car wreck.

28
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:47,126
I just don't know.

29
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:48,361
I didn't know if you knew.

30
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:50,630
- No, no, I'm
 sorry to hear that.

31
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,298
- [Elaine] I've been
  running the bar by myself,

32
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:53,266
and all I can do--

33
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:54,567
- Well, don't worry about it,

34
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:57,537
I'll, uh, I'll come up
 there this afternoon.

35
00:03:57,537 --> 00:03:59,606
- [Elaine] Oh, thanks, but you
 must have things to do and--

36
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:00,907
- No, no, it's no problem.

37
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:04,010
I've got, I've got
 not urgent business.

38
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,144
I'll be up there today.

39
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,414
- [Elaine] You're a good
friend, Deac, thanks very much.

40
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:09,248
- Okay.

41
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:13,319
(phone tone beeps)

42
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:16,823
(mid-tempo serious music)

43
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,975
- Fill it up, will ya?

44
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:49,716
- Hey, Audrey.

45
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,955
Let's leave town
 for the weekend, eh?

46
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:03,696
- Just a second.

47
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:07,333
Three bucks.

48
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:09,569
- Put it on my tab.

49
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,242
- You at least gonna
bring the bottles back?

50
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:21,114
(engine revs)

51
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:23,383
(tires screech)

52
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:26,052
(bottle clangs)

53
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:29,655
What do you want?

54
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:30,790
- Well, tell me
  you're not married

55
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:31,958
and the mother of three kids.

56
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:32,792
- I'm not.

57
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,262
- That and a tank of
  gas, I'll be a happy man.

58
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:49,075
- How many more of you
guys are gonna show up?

59
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:52,211
- How many more of me
  you think you can handle?

60
00:06:58,284 --> 00:06:59,852
- That'll get you
  to the next town.

61
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:01,988
- Well, I'm not going
 to the next town.

62
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:06,192
- Don't you guys ever get
tired of making life miserable?

63
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:07,026
- Nevermind.

64
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:11,964
Lady, if you could tell me

65
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:14,534
how to get to the Forty
Niners Bar and Grill,

66
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:15,368
I'd appreciate it.

67
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:16,235
Keep the change.

68
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:18,104
- Up there to the right.

69
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,105
- Thank you.

70
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:24,410
- Uh, are you Elaine's friend?

71
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,244
- Yeah.

72
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:28,981
- Uh, um, I'm sorry,

73
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:31,184
I thought you were
somebody else (laughs).

74
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:32,218
Welcome to town.

75
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:35,021
- I'll accept your
 apology over dinner.

76
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:37,723
- [Audrey] Okay (laughs).

77
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:39,225
- What's your name?

78
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:40,660
- Audrey (laughs).

79
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,595
- [Deacon] Deacon Porter.

80
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:47,600
- [Audrey] Hi.

81
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:52,038
(slow piano music)

82
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,510
- I didn't expect you so soon.

83
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,911
Take a look at that picture.

84
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,882
Marty sent me that just
  before you guys left Nam.

85
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,185
- I remember the day
 we took this picture.

86
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:07,720
â™ª Tell me what you see

87
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,188
- Seems like a long time ago.

88
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,925
Shame to go through
 all that combat,

89
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:14,694
and then to buy it in
 a lousy car accident.

90
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:16,462
- If it was a car accident.

91
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:20,566
- Marty was too good a driver,

92
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:22,235
and he knew these
  roads too well.

93
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:24,670
That was no accident, Deac.

94
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,939
- Who'd wanna kill--
 (door thuds)

95
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:27,773
- Elaine.

96
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:30,676
This the new help?

97
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:33,212
- [Elaine] Deacon
 Porter, Clay Marsh.

98
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:34,447
- Hi.

99
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:35,815
- [Clay] Expect, we'll
get to know each other.

100
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,688
- [Elaine] Deac fought
 with Marty in Vietnam.

101
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:44,557
- Vietnam.

102
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,536
Porter, let me give
 it to you straight.

103
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,072
We don't take to outsiders
  in King's Ransom.

104
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:03,643
Outsiders usually mean trouble.

105
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:04,911
And I don't need trouble.

106
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:06,879
- I'm just here
  to help a friend.

107
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,781
- See to it that you
 keep it that way.

108
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:11,951
Elaine.

109
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:16,789
- He always this friendly?

110
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:18,758
- He has a problem
  with the growers.

111
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:21,994
They've taken over the valley
 for their marijuana business.

112
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:23,195
- [Jerry] Come on, come here,

113
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:24,330
I wanna show you
 something, come on.

114
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,164
- [Linda] What?

115
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:25,998
- I'll show ya.

116
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:27,166
- [Linda] Huh?

117
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:29,969
- Ta dah!

118
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:33,806
- Oh, wow, we drove right
  past here last night,

119
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:35,207
and we didn't even see it.

120
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:36,542
- It was too dark.

121
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:38,110
It could've been anything.

122
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,278
Look!

123
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:40,646
- There's more
 growing over there.

124
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:42,181
- I knew you'd like
 California better than Canada.

125
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:45,351
(both laugh)

126
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:46,686
- Oh, it's harvest time.

127
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:47,520
- Right.

128
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,354
(gun fires)

129
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:51,624
(tense dramatic music)

130
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,761
Run, run, dammit.

131
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:56,595
- What's going on?

132
00:09:56,595 --> 00:09:57,430
- [Jerry] Hurry.

133
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:02,001
This way.

134
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:05,972
- [Man In Stripped
  Shirt] Over there!

135
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:11,043
- [Jerry] You head
  for the highway,

136
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:12,111
I'll try to draw their fire.

137
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,346
- No, no!

138
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:14,947
- [Jerry] Don't argue,
please Linda, do it, go!

139
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,282
- [Linda] Jerry!

140
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,952
(gun fires)

141
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:27,827
- [Man In Tan Jacket]
 Come on, this way!

142
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:32,765
- [Man] Relax, they'll get him.

143
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,201
- [Man In Tan Jacket] Come
 on, don't let him get away,

144
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:36,335
shoot him.

145
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:38,637
(guns fire)

146
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,708
(Jerry grunts)

147
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,559
- [Man On Left]
 There's our turkey.

148
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:01,694
(men laugh)

149
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:04,030
(gun fires)

150
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:17,977
(Linda screams)

151
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,681
(slow unsettling music)

152
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:28,487
(Linda grunts)

153
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:43,302
- Why you no good!

154
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,019
- Come on, let's go.

155
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:15,501
- (laughs) in it goes, boys!

156
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:16,335
Woo hoo!

157
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:31,684
(lively country music)

158
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:50,903
- Have a beer, Deac.

159
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:51,871
- [Deacon] Don't mind if I do.

160
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:53,339
- This is my friend, Jim.

161
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:54,640
- Hey.

162
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,841
- [Deacon] How you
  doin' there, Jim.

163
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:56,876
- Looks like Jim's
gettin' pretty friendly

164
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:57,743
with Porter over there.

165
00:12:57,743 --> 00:12:58,978
- [Man On Right] Yeah.

166
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:01,747
- This here is my
 partner, this is Deac.

167
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:02,581
- How are you?

168
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:04,016
Nice to meet you.

169
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:07,019
Excuse me just a minute.

170
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:07,853
- Hi.

171
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:08,687
- Hi.

172
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:11,223
- [Man On Right] Let's do it.

173
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:17,396
(upbeat country music)

174
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:18,697
- [Man In Green]
 Doing some talking?

175
00:13:18,697 --> 00:13:19,698
What'd you tell that guy?

176
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:21,767
Huh, what'd you tell him?

177
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:22,701
- [Jim] I think you got--

178
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:23,836
- [Man In Green] Big mouth!

179
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,473
I'll teach you to keep
 your big mouth shut.

180
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,607
(woman screams)

181
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:31,777
(man in green grunts)

182
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:43,989
- Lock him up, I'll
 press charges later.

183
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,435
- Come on, let's
 take a little walk.

184
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:04,243
- [Carey] I thought you
and I had an agreement.

185
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:05,611
- I had no choice.

186
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:08,414
The whole place
  saw what happened.

187
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:10,416
If Porter hadn't stopped
that goon of yours,

188
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,817
he would have beat
  that guy to death.

189
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:14,853
- He was just a little
 excitable, that's all.

190
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:17,456
You can let him out,
he's cooled down by now.

191
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:20,059
- Can't do it.

192
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:22,027
This time is different,
  Porter's pressing charges.

193
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:25,331
- Don't worry about
it, I'll handle Porter.

194
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:26,565
Everything's okay.

195
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:31,503
Here's a little something
  called bail money.

196
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:36,075
- I gotta turn you
down on this one Carey.

197
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:38,410
- Have it your way.

198
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:42,514
But remember one
thing, I give the word,

199
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:44,984
my boys will bury you
 in your hick town.

200
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:58,264
Now you better think real hard,

201
00:14:58,264 --> 00:14:59,932
and see if you can't recall

202
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:02,201
just who it is that's
 been keeping you

203
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:03,402
in business around here.

204
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:13,379
- Hawkins!

205
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:14,213
- Sheriff?

206
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:15,948
Yeah?

207
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,118
- Release the prisoner.

208
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:20,819
- Okay, Sheriff.

209
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:27,860
- As usual, it's a pleasure
doing business with you sheriff.

210
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:34,900
(door thuds)

211
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:38,237
(slow unsettling music)

212
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:46,312
- [Man In Vest] I
  was at that party.

213
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:47,980
I knew Marty pretty well.

214
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:50,082
But you're talking
  to the wrong guy.

215
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:50,916
I gotta go.

216
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:01,827
- Excuse me sir,

217
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:03,562
I'm afraid I'm gonna
  have to ask you to leave,

218
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:04,396
right now.

219
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:09,735
- Thank you.

220
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:13,539
(uptempo peppy music)

221
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:15,140
- So how do you like rural life?

222
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:18,977
- [Deacon] Seems everyone's
 too scared to talk to me.

223
00:16:18,977 --> 00:16:20,179
- [Man In Hat] Come on.

224
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:22,014
- Damn growers, they
think they own the town.

225
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:24,183
- What about your sheriff?

226
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:26,885
- I think they own him too.

227
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:31,123
- I have an idea, why
 don't I take you for a ride

228
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:32,324
through the countryside.

229
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:35,160
- That's the best
 offer I've had yet.

230
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,829
- Yeah, okay.

231
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:40,099
(mellow country music)

232
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:49,708
- Well, Audrey, don't
you look pretty tonight.

233
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:54,146
You really didn't have to get
 all dolled up on my account.

234
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:56,482
- Ready?

235
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:57,883
- [Audrey] Yeah.

236
00:16:57,883 --> 00:17:00,052
- Pardon me, I didn't realize
 you two were together.

237
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:02,488
Aren't you gonna introduce
  me to your friend?

238
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,326
- Deacon Porter, John Carey.

239
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:10,095
- Welcome to King's
 Ransom, Deacon Porter.

240
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:11,597
- Thank you.

241
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:13,499
- [Carey] I hope you find
  our town to your liking.

242
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:15,768
- You know what, Carey,
it's not your town.

243
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:18,337
- You ready?

244
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:19,171
- Yeah.

245
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:26,278
(door thuds)

246
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:43,962
(tense dramatic music)

247
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:04,450
(cars thud)

248
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:19,231
(tires screech)

249
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:43,489
- [Man] Son of a bitch!

250
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:45,324
Come on, come on, get out.

251
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:46,625
- Let's get him.

252
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:53,632
(men groan and grunt)

253
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,168
- [Man] Come on.

254
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:59,471
- [Man] Grab hold
  of him, I got him!

255
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,272
- Reese.

256
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:03,775
(Deacon grunts)

257
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:06,345
(punches thud)

258
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,782
- Come on, Carey,
 you gotta stop 'em!

259
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:12,251
- [Reese] Listen, Porter,

260
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:14,820
we own everything in this town.

261
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,288
(punch thuds)

262
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:17,856
- [Audrey] Come on, they're
 gonna kill him, please!

263
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:21,326
- Your boyfriend is just
not a reasonable man.

264
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,361
- Nobody owns me.

265
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:27,666
- Please, stop it.

266
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,269
(punches thud)

267
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:33,906
- You want him, take him.

268
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:37,910
Okay, boys, let him go.

269
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:45,651
- I'm gonna try
something else on this.

270
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:46,485
Just a second.

271
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:00,899
I think this is more the way to.

272
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:07,339
(slow gentle music)

273
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:14,246
Deac?

274
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:20,052
- I gotta go.

275
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:20,886
- Okay.

276
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,961
- It was an accident.

277
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:30,629
He had a few drinks,
 lost it on the curve,

278
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:32,064
went over the cliff.

279
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,732
- Doesn't sound like
  Marty to drink and drive.

280
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,634
- Well, people change,
 they get careless.

281
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:37,502
- Went through six years
of combat with that man.

282
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:39,638
He kept people alive
 because he wasn't careless.

283
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:42,441
- Hey, Porter, I'm
  trying to be nice to you.

284
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:43,742
- Don't be.

285
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:44,910
I'll find out what
  happened to Marty

286
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,878
with or without your help.

287
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:49,314
I wanna see that
  coroner's report.

288
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:51,783
- I don't have to
  show you anything.

289
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:53,452
- I'll be back
 with a court order.

290
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:00,292
- [Man With Rifle] Go
 right ahead, sheriff,

291
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:01,627
you know the way.

292
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:38,597
(men chatter)

293
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:46,304
- We gotta talk.

294
00:21:46,304 --> 00:21:47,773
- [Carey] What's on your mind?

295
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:51,677
- That guy Porter's
 threatening to open up

296
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:54,579
the investigation in
 Marcus Darien's death.

297
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:55,480
- Oh yeah?

298
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:58,116
- Yeah, I think he means it.

299
00:21:58,116 --> 00:22:00,952
That's one guy you
 shouldn't have messed with.

300
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:02,154
- Let him investigate.

301
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,388
What's he gonna find out?

302
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:05,157
- Maybe nothing.

303
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:10,028
But if that coroner you
  paid off decides to talk,

304
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:11,730
we're all in a lotta trouble.

305
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:13,732
- He won't talk.

306
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,102
- I think Porter can
 be pretty persuasive.

307
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,739
- Get on back to town,
  I'll figure something out.

308
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:24,209
- [Clay] Yeah.

309
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:35,921
(slow suspenseful music)

310
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:52,704
(gasoline sloshes)

311
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:01,947
- Let's see how they like this.

312
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:02,781
- Yeah.

313
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:06,685
(tense gripping music)

314
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:08,019
- [Man] Yee haw!

315
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,699
(coughs)

316
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:26,938
- [Deacon] Elaine!

317
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:33,879
Elaine!

318
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:41,486
(Elaine screams)

319
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:01,540
(glass shattering)

320
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:19,491
- [Man In Blue] Damn!

321
00:24:35,373 --> 00:24:38,376
(explosions rumble)

322
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:49,788
(gun fires)

323
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:08,139
- [Man In Flannel]
 Bob, what you think?

324
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:08,974
- Come on!

325
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:12,344
- [Man In Plaid]
  Got him (laughs).

326
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,281
- [Man With Dark
 Hair] That's one guy

327
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:17,515
won't be causing
anymore trouble.

328
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:19,618
- [Man In Plaid] Yeah,
you can say that again.

329
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:21,119
(both chuckle)

330
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:23,221
- [Man With Dark Hair] Come
 on, let's get outta here.

331
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:26,224
(slow somber music)

332
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:52,617
- 16 bucks.

333
00:25:55,353 --> 00:25:57,222
- Nice and peaceful
 around here, huh?

334
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:02,060
Too bad about your boyfriend.

335
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:12,938
(Clay chuckles)

336
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:23,548
â™ª I'm in the mood

337
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:28,153
(hums and vocalizes)

338
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,635
This isn't very
sociable of you, Audrey.

339
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:48,173
- I should kill you right
  now, you son of a bitch.

340
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:51,710
- Hysterical again?

341
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:52,644
- Get out.

342
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:53,745
- [Carey] Get outta here.

343
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:55,680
- Or I'll shoot your ass off.

344
00:26:58,316 --> 00:27:00,719
(lips smack)

345
00:27:05,323 --> 00:27:08,326
(slow gentle music)

346
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:13,391
- Hey, Deac.

347
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:15,693
- Spence?

348
00:28:18,396 --> 00:28:19,998
- This is it?

349
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:20,965
- [Deacon] You bet.

350
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:25,837
- Come on, Deac, you
  were lucky the last time.

351
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:29,040
You go back up there again,
they're gonna kill you for sure.

352
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:29,908
- Gotta go back.

353
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:32,310
- Why?

354
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:34,045
- Just something I
 gotta do, that's all.

355
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,447
- Will you knock off
 the John Wayne shit

356
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:37,982
for a minute and be realistic?

357
00:28:37,982 --> 00:28:39,284
- Did you bring the stuff?

358
00:28:40,518 --> 00:28:41,352
- Yeah.

359
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:55,333
Listen, you know I'm the best

360
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:57,769
electronics specialist
 in the business.

361
00:28:57,769 --> 00:28:59,504
Now I've been doing
 it for 20 years,

362
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:01,306
I can do it in my sleep.

363
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:04,175
You think you can
 learn everything from
 a book overnight?

364
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:08,179
Forget it Deac, it's hopeless.

365
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:09,581
You can't do it by yourself.

366
00:29:10,982 --> 00:29:13,351
I guess you're just gonna
  have to take me along.

367
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:15,487
- It's not your fight, Spence.

368
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:17,622
- Goddammit, Marty
  was my CO too.

369
00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:20,291
- I'm not taking you,
 now that's final.

370
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:21,893
- [Spencer] Fine,
  I'm gonna help you

371
00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:23,328
whether you like it or not.

372
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:31,236
- [Bartlett] You
 have my word on it.

373
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:34,439
- This is a rather
  expensive order.

374
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:36,908
I feel my partners
 will require something

375
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:39,777
a little more substantial
  than your word.

376
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:41,679
- I see your point.

377
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:45,850
Perhaps the deed to
 my boat will suffice.

378
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:47,952
- I think my
 partners will agree.

379
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:50,221
- I'll have the papers
for you this afternoon.

380
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:57,362
- Half down, the
 balance on delivery,

381
00:29:57,362 --> 00:30:01,733
including the return of
 your collateral, of course.

382
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:03,234
- Of course.

383
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:05,403
- Salam, Mr. Bartlett.

384
00:30:05,403 --> 00:30:06,237
- See you around,

385
00:30:10,341 --> 00:30:11,276
greaseball.

386
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:21,019
- You never change, do you?

387
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:28,760
- Hey, Jesus, it's
 been a long time, man,

388
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:31,262
long time.

389
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,866
- I just looked for you
over at the yacht club,

390
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:37,101
they told me I'd
  find you out here.

391
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:38,203
Nice boat (chuckles).

392
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:40,538
- Hell, Art, this isn't my boat.

393
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:43,107
That's my bucket over there.

394
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:45,510
- (chuckles) You snake.

395
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:49,714
- Look, uh, buddy, I know that-

396
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:52,417
- I just thought
  I'd drop by to see

397
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:54,018
if I could get you
 to change your mind

398
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:56,454
about going with
me to help Deac.

399
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:58,022
- I can't do it.

400
00:30:58,022 --> 00:30:59,924
I can't go with
  you, I'm past it.

401
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:00,858
- Come on.

402
00:31:00,858 --> 00:31:01,626
- You know what I do now?

403
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:04,829
I keep the rich Arabs
supplied with pop guns.

404
00:31:06,497 --> 00:31:09,267
It's a real nice arrangement.

405
00:31:10,735 --> 00:31:13,638
Now what can you say to me to
 make me wanna fuck that up?

406
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:16,407
- You got a friend
 who needs your help.

407
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:18,643
- I'll tell you what I'll do,

408
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:20,845
I'll put together
  a package for you.

409
00:31:20,845 --> 00:31:22,313
It'll be good, all you need.

410
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:25,283
But I can't go with you.

411
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:29,120
- Call me when it's ready.

412
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:40,164
(uptempo energetic music)

413
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:42,934
(crowd chatters)

414
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:51,109
- You on?

415
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:53,711
Go, woo!

416
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:54,512
Take it.

417
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:57,382
Yah!

418
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:59,517
- [Man With No Shirt] Whoo.

419
00:31:59,517 --> 00:32:01,919
- All right, come on, come on.

420
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:12,830
Okay, come on.

421
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:14,666
Cheese.

422
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:18,102
Hey, rat, check this out.

423
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:19,737
Want some balls, come on.

424
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:22,907
(men grunt and groan)

425
00:32:31,816 --> 00:32:34,218
All right, come on chop suey.

426
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:39,691
Chow mein time,
  brother (grunts).

427
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:41,693
- Hey, the winner, yeah!

428
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,961
(coins jingle)

429
00:32:43,961 --> 00:32:46,197
- [All] Cheater!

430
00:32:46,197 --> 00:32:49,033
- [Ox] Go, run, move it!

431
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:50,368
(gun fires)

432
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:51,436
- Get in!

433
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:54,072
- [Ox] Spence, you saved my ass!

434
00:32:57,275 --> 00:33:00,144
(knocking on door)

435
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:02,780
- Yeah?

436
00:33:06,617 --> 00:33:07,518
I'm coming.

437
00:33:07,518 --> 00:33:10,421
(knocking on door)

438
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,328
Who is it?

439
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,297
- [Ox] Where do you think
 you're going without me, mofo?

440
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:21,499
- Ox?

441
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:28,840
- Ah, (chuckles) yeah, Deac!

442
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:40,618
- [Keith] I'm telling you,

443
00:33:40,618 --> 00:33:42,653
there's a lifetime
  supply up here.

444
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:44,589
- [Student In Hat] Eh, far out.

445
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:45,823
- [Keith] Come on, up here.

446
00:33:45,823 --> 00:33:46,991
- [Student In Hat]
 (laughs) Where man?

447
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:49,227
- [Keith] Shh,
 just wait a minute.

448
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:51,796
- [Student In Hat]
 Yoo hoo, marijuana!

449
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:54,132
- [Keith] Hey, you
 gotta be serious here.

450
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:56,267
- [Arnold] Where is this stuff?

451
00:33:56,267 --> 00:33:58,669
- [Student In Hat]
 Oh, look at that, man.

452
00:33:58,669 --> 00:33:59,670
- [Arnold] Oh my god.

453
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:01,906
Wow, more, more.

454
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:05,209
Hey, I'll get the sack.

455
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:06,344
- [Student In Hat]
 Yeah, Arnold, get it.

456
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:07,278
- [Keith] What do ya think?

457
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:09,046
Mother Nature at its best.

458
00:34:09,046 --> 00:34:11,582
- [Student In Hat] True,
man, Keith, you said it.

459
00:34:11,582 --> 00:34:13,017
- Not bad, huh?

460
00:34:13,017 --> 00:34:14,385
- [Student In Hat]
  Too green, man.

461
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:15,453
Uh, look at that?

462
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,022
- This sprig is a
  little you know--

463
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:18,856
(weapon fires)

464
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:19,991
(student in hat grunts)

465
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:21,125
(tense suspenseful music)

466
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:23,361
- Hey, I think you got one.

467
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:27,131
- [Man In Hat] Check it out, eh.

468
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:34,272
Only a college kid.

469
00:34:38,943 --> 00:34:40,445
(weapon fires)

470
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:42,346
- [Keith] Arnold, shit.

471
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:02,600
Huh?

472
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,735
(gun fires)

473
00:35:04,735 --> 00:35:05,636
- [Barbara] Mornin'
 Sheriff, how are ya'?

474
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:07,004
- Barbara, good.

475
00:35:07,004 --> 00:35:09,006
- [Barbara] Good (chuckles).

476
00:35:09,006 --> 00:35:11,809
- [Reese] I'm worried about
 those kids, they went bonkers.

477
00:35:11,809 --> 00:35:13,077
Howdy, Miss Barbara.

478
00:35:13,077 --> 00:35:14,345
- Hi, Reese.

479
00:35:14,345 --> 00:35:15,146
- [Reese] You look
  mighty fine today.

480
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:17,415
- [Barbara] Why, thanks.

481
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:20,852
- [Reese] Well, look
 who's here, mornin'.

482
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,059
- How's the sheriff business?

483
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:31,562
- There's three kids missing
 from college over at Oak Hill.

484
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,300
- Maybe they took off
 on spring vacation.

485
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,335
- Maybe they didn't.

486
00:35:39,203 --> 00:35:43,608
Look, Carey, two campers
  disappeared from the east.

487
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:45,042
That coulda happened anywhere.

488
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:46,344
It's a big, wide country.

489
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:50,081
I'm talkin' about
  local kids now.

490
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:51,349
(Carey sighs)

491
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:53,050
And I'm not the only
 one that's talking.

492
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:55,786
- Well, then you better
  come up with some answers.

493
00:35:55,786 --> 00:35:56,787
- Don't push me.

494
00:35:58,523 --> 00:35:59,490
- What do you want?

495
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:01,559
More money?

496
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:04,829
- No more killings.

497
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:13,538
- When I do a job, I
 do what the job needs.

498
00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:16,340
You're in too deep to tell
  me to do anything else.

499
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:24,248
(slow ominous music)

500
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:27,185
(thunder crackles)

501
00:36:38,796 --> 00:36:41,732
(knocking on door)

502
00:37:02,086 --> 00:37:04,989
(knocking on door)

503
00:37:13,998 --> 00:37:17,001
(slow gentle music)

504
00:37:57,908 --> 00:38:00,378
- My uncle closed
 this place years ago.

505
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:03,581
Nobody comes around, I doubt
 Carey even knows about it.

506
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,133
- Looks solid, boss.

507
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,934
- This place checks
 out just fine.

508
00:38:25,503 --> 00:38:26,937
- All right, let's
  go get the gear.

509
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:28,673
- Let's start a war, all right!

510
00:38:29,874 --> 00:38:32,243
- Better get back
 to the gas station.

511
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:33,711
I don't want you gettin' hurt.

512
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:36,447
- I'll keep an eye
  on things, okay?

513
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:44,121
- Let's just torch
 the sons of bitches.

514
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:47,591
- They'd be back in business
 again in two months.

515
00:38:47,591 --> 00:38:50,428
No, I wanna take these bastards
apart one piece at a time.

516
00:38:50,428 --> 00:38:55,166
- You gotta be realistic, Ox,
 a little selective sabotage.

517
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,001
- Look it, we're gonna
 fight a goddamn war,

518
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:59,336
let's fight a
 goddamn war, do it.

519
00:38:59,336 --> 00:39:02,339
- We are, our way.

520
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:05,609
(tense dramatic music)

521
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,681
Look at this set up.

522
00:39:45,015 --> 00:39:47,351
Come on, take a closer look.

523
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:49,513
- Hey!

524
00:40:49,513 --> 00:40:51,882
(man grunts)

525
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:57,822
(man screams)

526
00:41:30,855 --> 00:41:32,456
- You still draw like a chicken.

527
00:41:33,457 --> 00:41:34,291
- Thanks.

528
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:38,729
- [Man] Why'd you start?

529
00:41:38,729 --> 00:41:40,631
- [Man] Yeah, hear
  the whole thing,

530
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:41,832
you want me to tell
 you the whole thing?

531
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,567
- [Man] Yeah, starting
 from the very top.

532
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:44,535
- [Man] Tell me about
 this chick, man,

533
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:45,903
it's incredible, all right.

534
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:47,338
Couldn't believe it myself.

535
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:48,572
- [Man] So did you get any?

536
00:41:48,572 --> 00:41:49,540
- [Man] What you
 mean did I get any?

537
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:50,307
Come on, who you talkin' to.

538
00:41:50,307 --> 00:41:52,676
(both laugh)

539
00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:57,681
- What's up?

540
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:59,617
- You pick up some
 of my boy last night?

541
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:00,885
- Now why would I do that?

542
00:42:00,885 --> 00:42:03,787
- Maybe you started to
 feel like a sheriff.

543
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:05,522
Just answer me, Marsh.

544
00:42:05,522 --> 00:42:07,124
- Hey, I didn't pick anybody up.

545
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:10,060
Jesus, you act like
 it was the first time

546
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,629
these punks took off on ya.

547
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:13,330
- Not three at once.

548
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:15,132
- Maybe they took
  a spring vacation.

549
00:42:15,132 --> 00:42:17,101
- And maybe some
 other grower decided

550
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:18,535
I had three men too many.

551
00:42:18,535 --> 00:42:20,571
- Hey, it's a tough business.

552
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:22,439
- This is my territory.

553
00:42:22,439 --> 00:42:24,108
I pay you to keep it that way.

554
00:42:37,621 --> 00:42:40,190
- Well, it ain't much, Spence,
 but it's all we've got.

555
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:42,426
- Yeah, Bart never came through.

556
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,029
But it should be interesting.

557
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:50,668
- I wish I had a bazooka.

558
00:42:52,803 --> 00:42:54,338
- Ox!

559
00:42:54,338 --> 00:42:55,172
- Oh!

560
00:42:55,172 --> 00:42:56,607
- Always complaining.

561
00:42:56,607 --> 00:42:59,009
- [Ox] You dickhead.

562
00:42:59,009 --> 00:42:59,877
You are a couple a.

563
00:42:59,877 --> 00:43:03,013
(mid-tempo rock music)

564
00:43:33,811 --> 00:43:37,047
(mellow country music)

565
00:43:53,063 --> 00:43:54,064
- Check out his car.

566
00:43:59,636 --> 00:44:00,404
- Here you are.

567
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:04,141
- [Man In Hat] Just
  passing through, are you?

568
00:44:06,744 --> 00:44:08,245
- Yeah, something like that.

569
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:11,982
- What sorta business you in?

570
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:15,953
- Minding my own.

571
00:44:20,724 --> 00:44:21,892
- Where you staying at?

572
00:44:24,528 --> 00:44:27,498
- A motel down the road.

573
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:28,732
- [Man In Hat] Uh huh.

574
00:44:28,732 --> 00:44:29,566
- Roach motel.

575
00:44:39,777 --> 00:44:40,611
- Shit.

576
00:44:43,313 --> 00:44:47,017
- Cam Thompson, there is
  cat hair in your armature.

577
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:48,485
- [Boy] I'm sorry, Miss King.

578
00:44:49,586 --> 00:44:52,389
- Well, you know I
usually get $35 an hour

579
00:44:52,389 --> 00:44:53,557
for this kind of work.

580
00:44:59,997 --> 00:45:01,498
Okay, half a piece
  of Double Bubble

581
00:45:01,498 --> 00:45:06,003
and a kiss from a future
Monte Carlo winner.

582
00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:20,284
- [Bartlett] Hey, hey, somebody!

583
00:45:20,284 --> 00:45:22,086
- [Man] Come on, shit
 head, get your ass in here.

584
00:45:22,086 --> 00:45:25,322
(tense dramatic music)

585
00:45:40,104 --> 00:45:42,940
(explosions boom)

586
00:45:47,277 --> 00:45:49,847
(weapons fire)

587
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:02,226
- [Spencer] Yahoo!

588
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:04,261
- Spence, jeep!

589
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:05,095
- Yeehaw!

590
00:46:10,734 --> 00:46:13,170
(Ox screams)

591
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:28,152
(weapons fire)

592
00:46:55,546 --> 00:46:57,881
(gun fires)

593
00:47:04,821 --> 00:47:09,827
Bulls.

594
00:47:15,098 --> 00:47:16,500
- [Man On Radio] Boss,
 they hit both trucks,

595
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,502
and blew the whole
 shipment up in smoke.

596
00:47:19,803 --> 00:47:21,004
- Repeat that.

597
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:22,406
- [Man On Radio]
 The convoy is gone.

598
00:47:22,406 --> 00:47:25,309
Plus, we just caught a stranger
with a van full of guns.

599
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:26,143
- Shit.

600
00:47:29,746 --> 00:47:33,317
Reese, they took the convoy.

601
00:47:33,317 --> 00:47:35,118
- Jesus, I doubled the security.

602
00:47:35,118 --> 00:47:37,154
- Obviously, it wasn't enough.

603
00:47:39,756 --> 00:47:42,659
If it's a war they
want, I'll give 'em one.

604
00:47:45,395 --> 00:47:46,230
(punches thud)

605
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:49,066
(Bartlett groans)

606
00:47:59,109 --> 00:48:00,310
Who you workin' for?

607
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:02,713
- Builder's Emporium.

608
00:48:03,647 --> 00:48:05,082
I'm in the lumbar department.

609
00:48:06,483 --> 00:48:09,453
- All you gotta do is
  tell us who sent you here.

610
00:48:09,453 --> 00:48:11,455
- Why don't you go
 buy yourself a dress.

611
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:14,291
(punch thuds)

612
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:17,127
(Bartlett grunts)

613
00:48:22,466 --> 00:48:24,701
- You think it's
worth dying for?

614
00:48:24,701 --> 00:48:27,170
(Bartlett spits)

615
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:29,373
(punches thud)

616
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:32,209
(Bartlett groans)

617
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:33,710
The guy's hardcore.

618
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:36,813
Bring some boys into town.

619
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:40,250
Chances are, he's
  not on his own.

620
00:48:42,953 --> 00:48:45,422
When he talks, I'll
 be over at the cafe.

621
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:49,359
(Bartlett grunts)

622
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:51,962
(punches thud)

623
00:49:10,981 --> 00:49:12,416
- Carey's boys picked up a guy

624
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:15,118
at Jake's Diner
  couple hours ago.

625
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:18,722
Jake said he had a whole van
 full of guns, military stuff.

626
00:49:18,722 --> 00:49:19,623
- Bartlett.

627
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:22,192
Where?

628
00:49:22,192 --> 00:49:23,026
- Jail, I think.

629
00:49:25,228 --> 00:49:28,732
(tense suspenseful music)

630
00:49:42,512 --> 00:49:43,513
- Oh, Jesus.

631
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:51,054
(men grunts)

632
00:49:57,728 --> 00:49:58,595
(Hawkins groans)

633
00:49:58,595 --> 00:49:59,429
- Ah ah!

634
00:50:04,634 --> 00:50:06,236
- [Deacon] Just stay real quiet.

635
00:50:18,582 --> 00:50:20,617
(keys clang)

636
00:50:20,617 --> 00:50:22,119
- [Hawkins] Hey, I'm
 going, I'm going.

637
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:24,554
- [Ox] Move it, come on,
  you wienie, get in there.

638
00:50:24,554 --> 00:50:26,156
- Hey, sleeping on
 the job, again, huh?

639
00:50:26,156 --> 00:50:27,090
(Bartlett groans)

640
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:27,924
Come on.

641
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:35,699
- [Ox] Okay, in, dickhead.

642
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:41,104
Pissant, punk.

643
00:50:41,104 --> 00:50:42,739
- [Man In Cell] What the fuck.

644
00:50:42,739 --> 00:50:44,541
You won't get away
  with this (moans).

645
00:50:47,077 --> 00:50:48,979
- [Ox] Hey, Deac, my lunch.

646
00:50:53,016 --> 00:50:55,285
- [Man In Cell] Hey, man,
  don't eat the fucking key.

647
00:50:55,285 --> 00:50:57,320
- [Man In Cell] We'll cut
 that key out of your fat gut.

648
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,489
- Son of a bitch.

649
00:50:59,489 --> 00:51:03,226
- [Ox] Delicious (laughs).

650
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:04,628
- Porter!

651
00:51:04,628 --> 00:51:06,163
- [Deacon] Stay
  out of it, Marsh.

652
00:51:11,835 --> 00:51:15,005
(slow riveting music)

653
00:51:30,053 --> 00:51:32,422
- [Bartlett] Guess you know
 how to throw a welcome party.

654
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:33,490
(all laugh)

655
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:34,958
- Woo hoo!

656
00:51:34,958 --> 00:51:37,394
- [Ox] All right, we
 got that Jack Daniels.

657
00:51:37,394 --> 00:51:38,228
All right.

658
00:51:39,362 --> 00:51:41,198
- [Spencer] Woo, yeah!

659
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:43,867
- Hey, have a little Jack
  Daniels there, buddy.

660
00:51:43,867 --> 00:51:45,936
Good to see ya,
  how ya been, huh?

661
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:47,137
- [Bartlett] Thanks, brother.

662
00:51:47,137 --> 00:51:48,939
- I knew you'd make it.
- Been on ya, huh?

663
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:51,475
Looks like they got you
  going there a little, huh?

664
00:51:51,475 --> 00:51:53,310
Pretty good lookin', huh?

665
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:55,111
- I just got the
 crap beat outta me.

666
00:51:55,111 --> 00:51:56,213
(all laugh)

667
00:51:56,213 --> 00:51:57,481
- No prob, good to see you.

668
00:51:57,481 --> 00:51:59,049
What the fuck, you know?

669
00:51:59,049 --> 00:52:00,283
- Good to see you too, man.

670
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:01,685
Good to see you too.

671
00:52:01,685 --> 00:52:04,020
- [Ox] Ooh, you sweetie, mm.

672
00:52:15,432 --> 00:52:19,035
(metal scrapes and clangs)

673
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:26,009
- [Carey] Let's nail
 that son of a bitch.

674
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:37,387
- [Audrey] Reese get your
  goddamn hands off me!

675
00:52:37,387 --> 00:52:39,523
You pig, let me go!

676
00:52:39,523 --> 00:52:41,958
- So you ride at his side, huh?

677
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:43,460
Throw her in the car.

678
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:44,961
- [Audrey] Carey, get your
 goddamn mercenaries off me.

679
00:52:44,961 --> 00:52:45,762
- [Carey] She's gonna take
  us to see her boyfriend.

680
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:48,765
- [Audrey] Goddammit!

681
00:52:51,368 --> 00:52:52,502
- Blow it!

682
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:55,472
(car tires screech)

683
00:52:57,173 --> 00:52:58,008
(weapon fires)

684
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:00,777
(explosion booms)

685
00:53:11,321 --> 00:53:12,556
- All right, let's go.
 - Go in!

686
00:53:12,556 --> 00:53:14,891
- [Man] Come on, get
 it in gear, move out.

687
00:53:14,891 --> 00:53:16,059
- [Man] Let's take
 care of these shits,

688
00:53:16,059 --> 00:53:18,562
come on let's shoot
 'em, let's go.

689
00:53:22,065 --> 00:53:23,333
- [Man In Hat] Come on,
let's get these jerks.

690
00:53:23,333 --> 00:53:24,734
- Come on.
  - Yeah.

691
00:53:26,469 --> 00:53:29,472
(slow uneasy music)

692
00:53:37,814 --> 00:53:40,216
- Reese, move out over there.

693
00:53:40,216 --> 00:53:42,218
The rest of you, follow me.

694
00:54:11,815 --> 00:54:14,985
(explosion booms)

695
00:54:14,985 --> 00:54:17,721
(tense dramatic music)

696
00:54:17,721 --> 00:54:20,290
(weapons fire)

697
00:54:35,071 --> 00:54:38,842
- [Bartlett] Scramble
or we'll never make it.

698
00:54:44,514 --> 00:54:46,349
- Blow the son of
 a bitch up, Spence.

699
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:28,091
- Move out!

700
00:56:09,966 --> 00:56:10,900
- Let's go!

701
00:56:25,381 --> 00:56:27,117
- They can't get far.

702
00:56:27,117 --> 00:56:30,320
Take the boys, track 'em.

703
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:33,189
Reese, no prisoners.

704
00:56:33,189 --> 00:56:34,424
- [Reese] Let's go, guys.

705
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:40,196
(tense dramatic music)

706
00:56:55,044 --> 00:56:56,446
Okay, let's go.

707
00:56:56,446 --> 00:56:57,247
Come on.

708
00:57:01,384 --> 00:57:03,853
- [Man In Hat] Come on,
  get the goddamn lead out.

709
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:12,762
(men grunt and groan)

710
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:29,579
(weapon fires)

711
00:57:38,388 --> 00:57:40,657
(Ox yells)

712
00:58:02,011 --> 00:58:03,179
- You, okay?

713
00:58:03,179 --> 00:58:05,381
- Yeah, just a little rusty.

714
00:58:14,490 --> 00:58:15,325
- [Clay] Where's Carey?

715
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:16,292
- [Man In Hat] Inside.

716
00:58:20,496 --> 00:58:21,664
(men laugh)

717
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:22,499
- Carey.

718
00:58:29,138 --> 00:58:31,174
- Get her inside.

719
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:33,276
- [Man] Come on, come on.

720
00:58:36,746 --> 00:58:39,916
- You and Porter can blow
  yourselves up all I care,

721
00:58:39,916 --> 00:58:40,984
but you let her go.

722
00:58:42,418 --> 00:58:43,820
- You're pressing your luck.

723
00:58:45,488 --> 00:58:48,258
- Hey, this stuff's
 gonna stop right here.

724
00:58:48,258 --> 00:58:50,727
I'm bringing in
  the state police.

725
00:58:50,727 --> 00:58:52,495
- I wouldn't do
 that if I were you.

726
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:54,864
- I mean it.

727
00:58:56,633 --> 00:58:57,467
- So do I.

728
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:03,873
Reese.

729
00:59:07,176 --> 00:59:10,446
(tense dramatic music)

730
01:00:13,576 --> 01:00:16,179
(weapons fire)

731
01:00:20,683 --> 01:00:23,353
- Boys, let's get him backed up.

732
01:01:00,923 --> 01:01:03,593
- [Man] Get the fuck outta here!

733
01:01:08,464 --> 01:01:09,799
- [Man] Who the?

734
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:28,284
- Thanks.

735
01:01:30,286 --> 01:01:31,254
- Save it, sheriff.

736
01:01:35,491 --> 01:01:36,626
- [Reese] Delta
 one, do you read me?

737
01:01:36,626 --> 01:01:38,661
Come in, this is Delta four.

738
01:01:38,661 --> 01:01:40,530
Delta one, come
 in, do you read me?

739
01:01:44,067 --> 01:01:46,235
- [Man in White] They got
  at least four of my men.

740
01:01:46,235 --> 01:01:47,570
They're all over the place.

741
01:01:50,106 --> 01:01:52,108
- [Man In Hat]
(coughs) Forget it man,

742
01:01:52,108 --> 01:01:54,510
these guys are too good,
let's get outta here.

743
01:01:55,978 --> 01:01:59,415
- No, we regroup and
 hit 'em again tonight.

744
01:01:59,415 --> 01:02:01,150
I'll call for more of the guys.

745
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:04,754
(mid-tempo gripping music)

746
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:10,660
(whistles)

747
01:02:15,598 --> 01:02:17,834
(grunting)

748
01:02:28,778 --> 01:02:30,546
(man in hat groans)

749
01:02:30,546 --> 01:02:33,149
(weapons fire)

750
01:02:40,089 --> 01:02:42,525
(men scream)

751
01:02:48,764 --> 01:02:50,666
- [Man In Tree]
  Hey, hey, help me!

752
01:02:50,666 --> 01:02:53,870
Don't leave me, let
 me go and help, ah!

753
01:03:00,743 --> 01:03:03,546
- Hey, I don't expect
 you to believe me.

754
01:03:03,546 --> 01:03:05,681
I want that viper
  as much as you do.

755
01:03:05,681 --> 01:03:07,416
- We don't need this
 dickhead, shoot him.

756
01:03:07,416 --> 01:03:10,219
- Hey, bog brain, you're
not gonna shoot anybody.

757
01:03:10,219 --> 01:03:11,654
I know of another way in there.

758
01:03:11,654 --> 01:03:12,488
- Ox.

759
01:03:17,527 --> 01:03:19,362
- You guys go barging in there,

760
01:03:19,362 --> 01:03:21,931
Audrey's gonna be the
 first one to get it.

761
01:03:21,931 --> 01:03:23,466
I know Carey's escape route.

762
01:03:24,367 --> 01:03:25,535
You'll never find it.

763
01:03:25,535 --> 01:03:26,736
You gotta take me along.

764
01:03:35,178 --> 01:03:36,913
- All right, sheriff, deal.

765
01:03:36,913 --> 01:03:39,448
But you make one
  move to cross me,

766
01:03:39,448 --> 01:03:41,284
I'll blow your fucking head off.

767
01:03:46,222 --> 01:03:49,458
(tense dramatic music)

768
01:04:07,109 --> 01:04:09,712
(metal clanks)

769
01:04:20,756 --> 01:04:21,591
- Shh!

770
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:46,082
- All right, Ox,
 there's your field.

771
01:04:46,983 --> 01:04:48,150
You torch it.

772
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:50,319
You guys see the
 fire, blow the bridge.

773
01:04:51,787 --> 01:04:53,522
- What if you're not back yet?

774
01:04:53,522 --> 01:04:54,357
- You blow it.

775
01:04:55,258 --> 01:04:56,092
- Okay.

776
01:04:58,094 --> 01:04:59,762
- Hey, Ox!

777
01:04:59,762 --> 01:05:03,599
That weed starts to burn,
 don't breathe too deep, huh?

778
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:06,002
- [Ox] (inhales) All right,

779
01:05:06,002 --> 01:05:07,737
biggest joint in
 the world (laughs)!

780
01:05:08,838 --> 01:05:12,174
(tense dramatic music)

781
01:05:24,654 --> 01:05:27,923
â™ª A hunting we will go

782
01:05:28,824 --> 01:05:31,160
(vocalizes)

783
01:05:35,197 --> 01:05:40,202
Oh, baby, the ganja (laughs)

784
01:05:42,104 --> 01:05:46,042
Ooh, yeah (laughs), delicious.

785
01:05:59,355 --> 01:06:00,756
- You might need this, Marsh.

786
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:57,079
(Ox yells)

787
01:06:57,079 --> 01:06:59,648
(weapons fire)

788
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:10,960
- Mwah, stay right
  there (laughs).

789
01:07:16,766 --> 01:07:19,735
Smoke, all we need
  is a little match.

790
01:07:23,205 --> 01:07:25,775
Beep (laughs).

791
01:07:37,453 --> 01:07:38,320
(alarm blares)

792
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:41,657
(tense dramatic music)

793
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:53,903
(men chatter)

794
01:07:58,040 --> 01:07:58,974
- [Man] What is it?

795
01:07:58,974 --> 01:07:59,775
- The outfield's been torched.

796
01:07:59,775 --> 01:08:01,343
The field's on fire.

797
01:08:01,343 --> 01:08:02,545
- Shotgun, get it right.

798
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:07,917
Alert the outposts,
 nobody in, nobody out.

799
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:10,686
- [Man On Right]
Come on, Henley.

800
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:38,414
- [Spencer] That's one.

801
01:08:44,854 --> 01:08:46,355
- [Man] All right,
  let's go, come on.

802
01:08:46,355 --> 01:08:48,124
- [Man] Come on,
  let's go get 'em.

803
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:49,458
- [Man] Come on let's go.

804
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:51,193
- [Bartlett] Come on.

805
01:08:59,835 --> 01:09:02,338
(weapon fires)

806
01:09:03,739 --> 01:09:06,442
- [Ox] (laughs) I love the
 smell of dope in the morning.

807
01:09:06,442 --> 01:09:07,943
(men chatter)

808
01:09:07,943 --> 01:09:11,280
(weapon fires)

809
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:15,151
- [Ox] Mm, (laughs) okay,
  let's take one of these.

810
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:17,353
Oh, hello baby, yeah.

811
01:09:17,353 --> 01:09:20,122
(speaks faintly)

812
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:24,660
Now let's kill some
 sons of bitches.

813
01:09:35,604 --> 01:09:36,438
Ah, nice!

814
01:09:41,577 --> 01:09:42,878
- [Reese] Drop it, Porter.

815
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:46,282
(Audrey groans)

816
01:09:46,282 --> 01:09:47,449
- Let her go, Reese.

817
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:51,554
- [Reese] I said drop it.

818
01:09:55,324 --> 01:09:58,160
(weapon clatters)

819
01:10:03,632 --> 01:10:05,634
- It ain't worth dying for, boy.

820
01:10:05,634 --> 01:10:06,468
Let her go.

821
01:10:06,468 --> 01:10:07,303
- Now the handgun.

822
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:10,539
Real easy!

823
01:10:10,539 --> 01:10:11,373
(gun fires)

824
01:10:11,373 --> 01:10:14,143
(Audrey screams)

825
01:10:20,182 --> 01:10:21,016
- [Clay] Come on let's go.

826
01:10:21,016 --> 01:10:22,685
Stay down, stay down.

827
01:10:22,685 --> 01:10:25,921
(weapons fire)

828
01:10:25,921 --> 01:10:27,089
- Quick, get out now.

829
01:10:27,089 --> 01:10:28,757
- [Man] Keep firing.

830
01:10:30,459 --> 01:10:32,394
- [Man] Son of a bitch.

831
01:10:33,596 --> 01:10:36,699
- Now shoot him.
 - Shoot him, come on.

832
01:11:06,161 --> 01:11:09,732
- [Ox] Ah, ha ha (laughs)!

833
01:11:25,981 --> 01:11:27,249
- [Man] Come on, we gotta stop

834
01:11:27,249 --> 01:11:30,185
that fat son of a
  bitch, he's crazy.

835
01:11:30,185 --> 01:11:32,788
(weapon fires)

836
01:11:42,264 --> 01:11:44,867
(weapon fires)

837
01:12:01,884 --> 01:12:03,552
- [Bartlett] Spence!

838
01:12:22,471 --> 01:12:24,139
- [Man] There he is.

839
01:12:28,944 --> 01:12:31,347
(Ox screams)

840
01:13:01,877 --> 01:13:04,246
- [Bartlett] Go on, take off!

841
01:13:04,246 --> 01:13:05,147
Go, go, go!

842
01:13:09,818 --> 01:13:13,055
(tense dramatic music)

843
01:13:26,101 --> 01:13:28,704
(weapon fires)

844
01:13:51,994 --> 01:13:54,930
(Bartlett screams)

845
01:14:35,204 --> 01:14:38,540
(slow unsettling music)

846
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:52,888
- Blow it, goddammit!

847
01:15:02,364 --> 01:15:03,198
Blow it!

848
01:15:29,725 --> 01:15:32,394
(water rumbles)

849
01:15:48,377 --> 01:15:49,211
- Deac!

850
01:15:58,387 --> 01:16:01,323
(slow somber music)

851
01:16:20,676 --> 01:16:24,913
(moves into tense
  dramatic music)
