1
00:02:01,804 --> 00:02:04,419
I think this is a no-parking zone.

2
00:03:01,929 --> 00:03:04,645
- What's taking you so long?
- Let's go.

3
00:03:04,729 --> 00:03:07,804
Street of the Liberation,
then Buddha Alley and Shuangta Street.

4
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:10,720
Then west on Changle Street
to Yikang Street.

5
00:03:10,804 --> 00:03:12,629
Why not Temple Street?

6
00:03:13,179 --> 00:03:16,220
It's under construction,
they're redesigning it.

7
00:03:16,304 --> 00:03:22,458
That leaves us with Kangjian Street and
the Alley of the Forest this afternoon.

8
00:03:23,179 --> 00:03:27,304
Didn't we already do it yesterday,
the Alley of the Forest?

9
00:03:27,388 --> 00:03:31,465
Okay, let's start again.
The data has been rejected.

10
00:03:34,429 --> 00:03:38,967
You're supposed to be collecting data.
Not chasing skirts.

11
00:03:39,929 --> 00:03:44,775
Are you going to pay me my bonus
if they take it away from me?

12
00:03:55,012 --> 00:03:57,501
FOREST LANE

13
00:04:15,262 --> 00:04:16,262
Move over.

14
00:04:16,429 --> 00:04:17,839
Go hold the pole.

15
00:04:17,954 --> 00:04:20,654
I don't want to come back
a third time.

16
00:04:23,512 --> 00:04:25,358
What about the notebook?

17
00:04:44,678 --> 00:04:46,385
Hold it steady!

18
00:05:17,679 --> 00:05:20,064
Hurry up!
We'll hit rush hour.

19
00:05:24,803 --> 00:05:26,927
How about eating around here?

20
00:05:27,011 --> 00:05:28,386
Where?

21
00:05:28,554 --> 00:05:31,092
The eatery over there looks good.

22
00:05:31,553 --> 00:05:33,245
What's wrong with you?

23
00:05:33,928 --> 00:05:35,385
Rush hour, right?

24
00:05:35,553 --> 00:05:36,750
My treat.

25
00:06:05,803 --> 00:06:09,111
Are you eating?
You can go home and dream.

26
00:06:10,677 --> 00:06:11,677
Check.

27
00:06:25,678 --> 00:06:27,293
I don't believe it...

28
00:06:30,886 --> 00:06:32,759
So much for your treat.

29
00:06:32,928 --> 00:06:35,469
If we waited a bit,
maybe the rain will stop.

30
00:06:35,553 --> 00:06:37,861
You can wait here by yourself!

31
00:06:50,761 --> 00:06:52,634
Hey, I didn't mean it!

32
00:07:18,927 --> 00:07:20,005
Here.

33
00:07:20,802 --> 00:07:21,965
Thank you.

34
00:07:35,927 --> 00:07:37,468
Hey, watch it!

35
00:07:41,302 --> 00:07:42,302
I'm sorry.

36
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:44,466
It's okay, I'll get it

37
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:40,379
You done staring?

38
00:08:41,802 --> 00:08:42,962
May we go now?

39
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,260
Jump! Jump!

40
00:08:55,052 --> 00:08:57,590
Shoot him!
There's lots of them!

41
00:08:58,426 --> 00:08:59,623
Awesome!

42
00:09:01,551 --> 00:09:02,468
Kill him!

43
00:09:02,552 --> 00:09:04,593
That's the one who killed me!

44
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:07,212
That's him! Kill him!

45
00:09:07,426 --> 00:09:08,504
Great!

46
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,093
Your mom brought you some stuff.

47
00:09:14,177 --> 00:09:15,966
That's him, Kill him!

48
00:09:16,177 --> 00:09:19,467
- Did she say anything?
- Yes... But I forgot what.

49
00:09:19,551 --> 00:09:21,258
That's him, Kill him!

50
00:09:21,551 --> 00:09:23,874
You're almost there!

51
00:09:24,302 --> 00:09:27,003
New record! You broke the record!

52
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:25,067
What are you putting up there?

53
00:10:25,384 --> 00:10:26,846
I'm talking to you!

54
00:10:27,551 --> 00:10:30,342
It's a new regulation.
We have to do it.

55
00:10:30,426 --> 00:10:33,957
What the hell?
I don't want anybody looking at my ass?

56
00:10:34,226 --> 00:10:37,066
- It only shoots from the shoulders up.
- Don't bullshit me!

57
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:39,292
- It's for your own safety.
- My safety?

58
00:10:39,376 --> 00:10:43,561
We only keep it for 24 hours.
It's taped over after that

59
00:10:43,801 --> 00:10:45,460
Great. Go ahead.

60
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,858
I'm counting on you this time.

61
00:10:51,634 --> 00:10:52,711
I owe you big.

62
00:10:58,884 --> 00:11:01,217
- Where's my share?
- What have you done?

63
00:11:01,301 --> 00:11:02,379
Hey!

64
00:11:05,426 --> 00:11:06,426
Take it back.

65
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:08,050
Asshole!

66
00:11:08,259 --> 00:11:10,182
- Let's go.
- Tight ass.

67
00:11:18,675 --> 00:11:24,377
Boss says no bonus unless your van
passes the health inspection.

68
00:11:24,633 --> 00:11:25,878
Again?

69
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,712
Hey, Jinginjg.

70
00:11:28,425 --> 00:11:30,583
How about Mah-jong tonight?

71
00:11:32,633 --> 00:11:34,018
Who else is going?

72
00:11:35,633 --> 00:11:38,018
He's too young for adult games.

73
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,758
I'm busy tonight.

74
00:11:39,925 --> 00:11:41,002
Oh, come on...

75
00:11:53,301 --> 00:11:55,706
NAME: GUAN LIFEN
TEL: 65281753

76
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:39,953
Our motto is: service first,
credibility first and customer first.

77
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,146
Honesty and trust are our guidelines.

78
00:13:11,382 --> 00:13:12,536
Mr. Li Qiuming?

79
00:13:15,299 --> 00:13:16,496
How do you do?

80
00:13:16,674 --> 00:13:18,466
We spoke on the phone just now.

81
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,877
I am Xie Bo.

82
00:13:21,257 --> 00:13:24,026
Sorry to make you come all this way.

83
00:13:24,632 --> 00:13:27,863
- Can I get you a drink?
- No, thank you.

84
00:13:30,425 --> 00:13:33,241
Guan Lifen has an experiment to finish.

85
00:13:33,325 --> 00:13:37,171
She won't be able to make it.
I'm her supervisor.

86
00:13:39,383 --> 00:13:43,306
If you have any doubts,
you can call her to check.

87
00:13:44,174 --> 00:13:45,174
That's okay.

88
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:11,716
Let me get you something.
A coffee?

89
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,048
Really, no need.

90
00:14:13,674 --> 00:14:15,131
Coffee, please.

91
00:14:19,674 --> 00:14:22,210
You must know Miss Guan well.

92
00:14:23,382 --> 00:14:26,001
Oh, no. We just met.

93
00:14:28,049 --> 00:14:31,357
Then you're a moral
example for all of us.

94
00:14:32,324 --> 00:14:34,709
I must be going. Just a moment.

95
00:14:41,007 --> 00:14:43,548
Write down your company's
contact information.

96
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:44,710
What for?

97
00:14:44,924 --> 00:14:47,298
I'll write a letter of
thanks to your employer.

98
00:14:47,382 --> 00:14:48,882
No need for that.

99
00:14:48,999 --> 00:14:50,499
Really, I insist.

100
00:14:57,007 --> 00:15:00,699
Your surname is Li,
write next to the letter L.

101
00:15:37,549 --> 00:15:38,857
Turn right again.

102
00:15:51,881 --> 00:15:53,189
Make a left here.

103
00:16:25,673 --> 00:16:26,673
Slow down.

104
00:16:27,423 --> 00:16:28,620
Turn in there.

105
00:16:45,923 --> 00:16:48,376
FOREST LANE

106
00:16:48,756 --> 00:16:51,624
Did we take a left on Guling Street?

107
00:16:51,881 --> 00:16:52,881
Yup.

108
00:16:53,131 --> 00:16:55,839
Why doesn't the GPS indicate
Forest Lane?

109
00:16:55,923 --> 00:16:58,114
You never know with these things.

110
00:16:58,198 --> 00:17:00,376
- Going any further?
- No.

111
00:17:00,548 --> 00:17:01,702
That's 15 yuan.

112
00:18:12,672 --> 00:18:15,079
LABORATORY 203

113
00:18:57,905 --> 00:19:00,671
Women's living has a circulation
of less than 10,000 copies,

114
00:19:00,755 --> 00:19:02,963
but employs more than 50 people.

115
00:19:03,047 --> 00:19:05,010
We've become a retirement home.

116
00:19:05,094 --> 00:19:09,338
When the Party's publications closed down
their ex-employees all flocked to us.

117
00:19:09,422 --> 00:19:11,960
Why are we selling so few copies?

118
00:19:13,505 --> 00:19:15,582
This is a women's magazine.

119
00:19:15,797 --> 00:19:18,878
Look at us:
we're all men.

120
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:20,873
And old men at that!

121
00:19:22,422 --> 00:19:24,330
What do we do about it?

122
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:28,875
We need to attract female comrades,

123
00:19:29,047 --> 00:19:31,712
especially young, fashionable ones.

124
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:34,499
Female comrades are the key.

125
00:19:34,922 --> 00:19:35,922
Lao Ma...

126
00:19:36,547 --> 00:19:39,009
I proposed this to you long ago.

127
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,962
And what did you say?

128
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:44,088
That women don't know anything
about their own lives.

129
00:19:44,172 --> 00:19:46,864
That only men know what women need.

130
00:19:47,797 --> 00:19:50,105
What kind of magazine is this?

131
00:19:50,296 --> 00:19:52,962
Who dares to cross the line?
We're being ridiculous!

132
00:19:53,046 --> 00:19:54,125
Absolute crap!

133
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,113
You're the one talking crap!

134
00:19:56,197 --> 00:19:57,966
Come here and say that!

135
00:19:58,672 --> 00:20:01,871
I dare you to repeat that!

136
00:20:17,797 --> 00:20:20,045
Your tricks won't work with me.

137
00:20:20,129 --> 00:20:22,667
I'm telling you. This isn't over!

138
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,421
We'll see about that.

139
00:20:24,505 --> 00:20:25,702
Fine.

140
00:20:32,196 --> 00:20:34,042
What are you doing here?

141
00:20:35,296 --> 00:20:37,219
I'm taking you to dinner.

142
00:20:38,422 --> 00:20:39,807
What the hell for?

143
00:20:41,596 --> 00:20:43,296
It's your birthday. Remember?

144
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:46,226
Mom's already gone to get us a table.

145
00:20:49,796 --> 00:20:51,258
Hey! Pass the ball!

146
00:20:59,046 --> 00:21:02,815
How many times have I told you
not to play here!

147
00:21:07,254 --> 00:21:09,946
We'll eat at home. And that's that!

148
00:21:27,421 --> 00:21:30,088
...While at the People's Court.

149
00:21:30,296 --> 00:21:35,120
Minister Zhou inspected the
state-of-the-art facilities

150
00:21:35,296 --> 00:21:39,834
and watched live feeds of
police interrogation procedures.

151
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,087
Zhou said that stress should be laid
on fairness and impartiality,

152
00:21:43,171 --> 00:21:47,786
and that all court verdicts
should stand the tests of time.

153
00:21:56,003 --> 00:21:57,837
Vice Premier Li Kegiang..

154
00:21:57,921 --> 00:22:02,045
met with US Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton in Beijing today.

155
00:22:02,129 --> 00:22:03,821
This is for the month.

156
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:11,048
Give it to your mother.

157
00:22:41,045 --> 00:22:42,891
...The ball hit the net.

158
00:22:45,821 --> 00:22:48,994
The Chinese players have a clear
advantage over their opponents.

159
00:22:49,078 --> 00:22:53,186
None of the Vietnamese players
is taller than 2 meters.

160
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:01,461
- Put the apron on.
- I don't need it.

161
00:23:01,545 --> 00:23:02,742
Put it on!

162
00:23:14,345 --> 00:23:17,094
You can stop giving me money.
I've got enough.

163
00:23:17,178 --> 00:23:19,394
I don't want to get
you in trouble again.

164
00:23:19,478 --> 00:23:20,705
I won't.

165
00:23:21,545 --> 00:23:24,160
Where did you get the extra money?

166
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,170
I'm not a trainee anymore.

167
00:23:28,253 --> 00:23:29,331
It's true.

168
00:23:31,253 --> 00:23:32,498
Welcome!

169
00:23:33,295 --> 00:23:37,419
Starting today, this floor will be
reserved exclusively for officials.

170
00:23:37,503 --> 00:23:41,580
The utmost discretion
must be maintained.

171
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:43,793
- Is this understood?
- Yes.

172
00:23:43,877 --> 00:23:46,201
As for appearance...

173
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,826
your makeup should be light.

174
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:53,749
Sweep every room on this floor by 5pm.

175
00:23:54,252 --> 00:23:57,867
- Make sure everything is clean.
- No problem.

176
00:23:58,053 --> 00:23:59,794
Who dares to mess with officials?

177
00:23:59,878 --> 00:24:01,374
What did you say?

178
00:24:01,503 --> 00:24:02,960
He's a joker, sir.

179
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:04,862
We'll take care of it.

180
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,959
Bedrooms are mine.

181
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:46,165
Take a look at this.

182
00:25:46,377 --> 00:25:49,210
I sweet-talked the boss
into lightening our load.

183
00:25:49,294 --> 00:25:52,335
Wait a minute.
Are we changing districts?

184
00:25:52,419 --> 00:25:55,709
- We're done with Jianye.
- What about Forest Lane?

185
00:25:55,793 --> 00:25:59,460
Forget about it.
The system won't register some places.

186
00:25:59,544 --> 00:26:02,006
- Why not?
- There's no reason?

187
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:04,602
Let me check with the manager.

188
00:26:05,002 --> 00:26:07,310
He's the one who decided this.

189
00:26:07,877 --> 00:26:12,262
- I just want to ask him...
- What are you trying to do?

190
00:26:12,501 --> 00:26:15,043
Who's in charge here? The manager, me,

191
00:26:15,127 --> 00:26:17,498
or you, the trainee?

192
00:26:49,627 --> 00:26:50,872
Hi.

193
00:26:51,377 --> 00:26:54,245
Have a seat.
What can I get you?

194
00:26:54,501 --> 00:26:56,872
- A Coke.
- Will that be all?

195
00:26:57,043 --> 00:26:58,274
Coming right up.

196
00:26:59,043 --> 00:27:00,371
You're open late.

197
00:27:01,169 --> 00:27:04,996
What can you do...
You have to make a living.

198
00:27:06,168 --> 00:27:07,495
Business is good?

199
00:27:07,918 --> 00:27:09,841
This is a lousy location.

200
00:27:10,377 --> 00:27:14,992
Hardly any companies.
I have a few regulars during the day.

201
00:27:24,126 --> 00:27:28,867
Do you know anything about lab 203,
on Forest Lane?

202
00:27:29,502 --> 00:27:31,126
Lab 203?

203
00:27:32,418 --> 00:27:33,994
Never heard of it.

204
00:27:34,251 --> 00:27:38,084
As long as they eat my wontons,
they can do whatever they want.

205
00:27:38,168 --> 00:27:39,708
That'll be 5 yuan.

206
00:28:27,168 --> 00:28:32,553
I would've gone looking for you
even if you hadn't been "passing by".

207
00:28:32,918 --> 00:28:33,995
Why is that?

208
00:28:36,251 --> 00:28:38,866
To thank you in person, of course.

209
00:28:40,043 --> 00:28:41,701
It wasn't a big deal.

210
00:28:47,293 --> 00:28:49,062
So you work at lab 203?

211
00:28:50,043 --> 00:28:51,735
How did you know that?

212
00:28:52,668 --> 00:28:53,994
Just a guess.

213
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:56,558
Do you come around here often?

214
00:28:57,042 --> 00:28:59,709
Not really.
Just a few times for surveying work.

215
00:28:59,793 --> 00:29:03,101
I've run into you more
than "a few" times.

216
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,333
We run into each other every time.

217
00:29:05,417 --> 00:29:07,032
What a coincidence...

218
00:29:09,001 --> 00:29:11,309
You must be my guardian angel.

219
00:29:11,793 --> 00:29:14,870
You appear every time
I have a problem.

220
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:17,173
Tonight it doesn't count.

221
00:29:17,626 --> 00:29:18,703
How's that?

222
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:26,678
I'm no help to you,
you're the one who's taking me home.

223
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:38,542
Oops...

224
00:29:38,626 --> 00:29:41,624
Shouldn't I have turned left?

225
00:29:41,943 --> 00:29:45,174
Don't worry.
We can turn left further up.

226
00:29:47,876 --> 00:29:49,949
You should install a GPS.

227
00:29:50,917 --> 00:29:51,948
A GPS?

228
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:56,337
What would the GPS have told me?

229
00:30:02,792 --> 00:30:06,324
"Turn left on Fengdeng Street.

230
00:30:06,542 --> 00:30:09,991
"Turn left on Fengdeng Street..."

231
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:19,366
Can you lend me some money?

232
00:31:21,417 --> 00:31:22,614
What?

233
00:31:24,041 --> 00:31:26,118
Can you lend me some money?

234
00:31:27,442 --> 00:31:30,442
Spending it on someone special, are we?

235
00:31:31,749 --> 00:31:33,456
Who is she?

236
00:31:34,291 --> 00:31:35,618
There is no girl.

237
00:31:37,541 --> 00:31:42,387
You can't even get the thing to
focus today. Still pretending?

238
00:31:44,499 --> 00:31:47,730
I'll pay you back
from my next pay check.

239
00:31:51,167 --> 00:31:55,078
Don't date out of your league.

240
00:31:55,291 --> 00:31:57,329
Don't waste your money.

241
00:32:03,316 --> 00:32:05,239
Fine. Don't lend it then.

242
00:32:05,499 --> 00:32:06,499
Come back!

243
00:32:10,041 --> 00:32:11,866
You're getting touchy.

244
00:32:13,124 --> 00:32:15,612
You think I can't afford it?

245
00:32:17,541 --> 00:32:19,449
So here we are...

246
00:32:19,791 --> 00:32:24,176
Behind us, Lifu Street
and in front, the Zhongshan Gate.

247
00:32:24,416 --> 00:32:25,743
And on the right.

248
00:32:28,666 --> 00:32:30,832
There's a "Shanghai garden" after all.

249
00:32:30,916 --> 00:32:34,070
You can have a 3D view
by pressing here.

250
00:32:37,416 --> 00:32:38,416
Thank you.

251
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:40,946
It's nothing.

252
00:32:43,541 --> 00:32:45,310
Where are we going now?

253
00:32:56,166 --> 00:32:58,950
Forest Lane

254
00:33:00,665 --> 00:33:01,665
Enter.

255
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,873
Address unknown

256
00:33:08,416 --> 00:33:10,801
Let's go somewhere fun instead.

257
00:33:27,916 --> 00:33:29,839
Look at that baby monkey!

258
00:33:31,123 --> 00:33:32,508
He's eating a lot!

259
00:33:35,499 --> 00:33:36,730
Here's one more!

260
00:33:40,998 --> 00:33:43,203
What's your favourite hobby?

261
00:33:43,415 --> 00:33:44,611
My favourite?

262
00:33:44,874 --> 00:33:46,412
Playing video games.

263
00:33:47,373 --> 00:33:49,664
- Where do you play?
- At home.

264
00:33:49,748 --> 00:33:51,831
My roommate loves zombie games.

265
00:33:51,915 --> 00:33:53,289
And besides games?

266
00:33:53,373 --> 00:33:56,290
Internet.
Do you spend any time online?

267
00:33:56,374 --> 00:33:59,143
Not too much.
I just read the news.

268
00:34:00,248 --> 00:34:03,094
We should play online games sometime.

269
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:05,867
I'm no good at video games.

270
00:34:06,249 --> 00:34:08,249
We could chat online then.

271
00:34:09,998 --> 00:34:13,414
I don't just play games.
I look stuff up too.

272
00:34:13,498 --> 00:34:14,743
For my map.

273
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,118
Your map?

274
00:34:20,748 --> 00:34:24,991
I'm making my own map,
with my favourite places.

275
00:34:25,915 --> 00:34:27,242
Such as?

276
00:34:29,041 --> 00:34:30,426
Give me your hand.

277
00:34:35,623 --> 00:34:40,854
Our latitude is 32.0936° north
and our longitude is 118.7939° east.

278
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:46,636
where Li Qiuming and Guan Lifen
hold hands for the first time.

279
00:35:48,372 --> 00:35:49,866
Two sodas, please.

280
00:36:20,997 --> 00:36:22,242
Mr. Surveyor!

281
00:36:26,039 --> 00:36:28,990
How many times have we met?

282
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:33,270
This must be the fourth time.

283
00:36:33,372 --> 00:36:34,486
Why is that?

284
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:47,270
How do you know
I don't have a boyfriend?

285
00:36:50,497 --> 00:36:53,862
When I asked you out,
you didn't hesitate.

286
00:36:54,289 --> 00:36:55,367
And besides.

287
00:36:59,539 --> 00:37:00,847
And besides what?

288
00:37:01,247 --> 00:37:02,325
Besides...

289
00:37:04,414 --> 00:37:08,260
Even if he went after you,
you wouldn't like him.

290
00:37:10,122 --> 00:37:11,200
Who?

291
00:37:15,621 --> 00:37:17,992
That Xie Bo guy.

292
00:37:18,912 --> 00:37:21,080
He said he was your supervisor.

293
00:37:21,164 --> 00:37:23,626
But I can see that he likes you.

294
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:25,199
Except that...

295
00:37:26,871 --> 00:37:30,486
I don't think you two
would make a good match.

296
00:37:36,871 --> 00:37:38,697
You're only half right.

297
00:37:39,288 --> 00:37:40,484
Which half?

298
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:43,808
Figure it out yourself.

299
00:38:47,621 --> 00:38:49,364
Who do you live with?

300
00:38:49,621 --> 00:38:51,159
A couple of friends.

301
00:38:52,162 --> 00:38:53,703
What do they do?

302
00:38:53,912 --> 00:38:55,912
Anything that comes along.

303
00:40:22,412 --> 00:40:23,797
I should be going.

304
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:26,774
- Was that the lab?
- Yeah.

305
00:40:30,536 --> 00:40:33,867
We can go back to the park
next Sunday.

306
00:40:34,288 --> 00:40:35,697
Next Sunday?

307
00:40:37,411 --> 00:40:39,616
That's a date then.

308
00:40:43,288 --> 00:40:44,484
That's 15 yuan.

309
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:48,370
Here you go.

310
00:41:04,495 --> 00:41:05,740
Which one?

311
00:41:05,995 --> 00:41:06,995
This one?

312
00:41:08,911 --> 00:41:10,526
The other one, below.

313
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:14,577
You can't see her face clearly.

314
00:41:14,661 --> 00:41:16,353
That's the one I want.

315
00:41:31,286 --> 00:41:33,823
Is everything ok?

316
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,988
To: Guan Lifon

317
00:41:41,161 --> 00:41:43,484
Sending...

318
00:41:50,536 --> 00:41:54,459
The number you are trying to reach
is turned off..

319
00:41:56,785 --> 00:42:00,170
I made the photo brighter.
It's better now.

320
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:04,699
The number you have dialled
is not available.

321
00:42:08,661 --> 00:42:09,858
That was fast!

322
00:42:10,536 --> 00:42:11,993
She was hot!

323
00:42:17,745 --> 00:42:18,745
Hello?

324
00:42:19,786 --> 00:42:20,983
Which model?

325
00:42:22,661 --> 00:42:23,661
Got it.

326
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:28,490
Going in?

327
00:42:49,495 --> 00:42:50,692
That's the one.

328
00:42:55,244 --> 00:42:57,398
Isn't that one a little big?

329
00:42:57,535 --> 00:42:58,451
Not at all.

330
00:42:58,535 --> 00:43:01,920
Behind a tinted window,
no one will notice.

331
00:43:05,494 --> 00:43:07,982
- Are you the installer?
- Yes.

332
00:43:09,370 --> 00:43:12,201
This will go in an
old whitewashed house.

333
00:43:12,285 --> 00:43:14,359
Will it stand out?

334
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:16,607
Probably.

335
00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:26,201
- Otherwise, get the pinhole camera.
- Too expensive.

336
00:43:26,285 --> 00:43:29,616
You won't find cheaper than this.

337
00:43:29,785 --> 00:43:32,323
I could always hire someone else?

338
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,083
Ask around if you like...

339
00:43:35,785 --> 00:43:38,951
Listen, I'm going to go
out and make a phone call.

340
00:43:39,035 --> 00:43:41,727
Think about the price a little bit.

341
00:43:58,785 --> 00:43:59,864
Hey, boss,

342
00:44:00,118 --> 00:44:03,041
What's up with this guy you sent over?

343
00:44:03,869 --> 00:44:06,023
He said the price was wrong.

344
00:44:06,535 --> 00:44:07,993
Too expensive.

345
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:18,814
What price did you tell him?

346
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,191
What?

347
00:44:34,284 --> 00:44:37,035
No, that's like doing it for free...

348
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:38,316
Look here.

349
00:44:40,785 --> 00:44:42,491
It's a set-up.

350
00:44:46,909 --> 00:44:47,989
Go!

351
00:45:17,284 --> 00:45:18,743
Can I help you?

352
00:45:19,284 --> 00:45:20,364
Where is she?

353
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:22,571
She's coming.

354
00:45:23,784 --> 00:45:26,975
- What brings you here?
- I was just passing by.

355
00:45:27,059 --> 00:45:28,200
This is my son.

356
00:45:28,284 --> 00:45:30,450
He looks like you.
Where does he work?

357
00:45:30,534 --> 00:45:32,284
In a digital mapping company.

358
00:45:32,368 --> 00:45:34,358
He is a survey engineer.

359
00:45:37,784 --> 00:45:40,399
Are you alright?
You can tell me.

360
00:45:46,784 --> 00:45:49,938
You look well.
How's the new medication?

361
00:45:50,409 --> 00:45:53,332
I think it's really working this time.

362
00:45:58,118 --> 00:45:59,118
Listen...

363
00:46:00,043 --> 00:46:02,380
Your father has been
re-elected editor-in-chief.

364
00:46:02,464 --> 00:46:04,284
He's in a good mood these days.

365
00:46:04,368 --> 00:46:06,599
Come home for dinner tonight?

366
00:46:12,533 --> 00:46:15,200
- How much is this?
- 60.

367
00:46:16,534 --> 00:46:17,944
It's handmade.

368
00:46:18,867 --> 00:46:20,361
I make them myself.

369
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:29,099
What do you say?

370
00:46:29,284 --> 00:46:32,130
- I'm going back to work.
- Already?

371
00:47:14,658 --> 00:47:19,068
Longitude: 118.7624° East
Latitude: 32.0627° North

372
00:48:03,117 --> 00:48:06,612
DEMOLITION IN PROGRESS

373
00:48:43,533 --> 00:48:46,949
RELOCATING COMMUNITIES
FOR A BRIGHTER FUTURE

374
00:48:47,033 --> 00:48:51,187
I swear to you... What a dump!
What's left to survey?

375
00:48:52,157 --> 00:48:53,354
This way.

376
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:13,823
Excuse me, is Scissors Lane this way?

377
00:49:13,907 --> 00:49:16,061
- Who are you?
- Surveyors.

378
00:49:16,158 --> 00:49:17,907
The developers are back!

379
00:49:17,991 --> 00:49:19,069
Again?

380
00:49:21,157 --> 00:49:24,073
Who is your boss?
Why isn't he here?

381
00:49:24,282 --> 00:49:27,657
You're misunderstood us
We're looking for the Scissors Lane.

382
00:49:27,741 --> 00:49:30,782
You haven't corrected
the measurements of my house here!

383
00:49:30,866 --> 00:49:32,988
Fellows, it's a mistake.

384
00:49:33,157 --> 00:49:35,823
- We don't survey houses.
- We do city maps.

385
00:49:35,907 --> 00:49:39,448
If you don't survey, why do you
carry this? To beat people up?

386
00:49:39,532 --> 00:49:42,224
Calm down!
No need to get violent!

387
00:49:42,532 --> 00:49:44,322
Come back here!

388
00:49:55,157 --> 00:49:57,823
Even a blind man would see
that this is a trap street.

389
00:49:57,907 --> 00:49:59,104
Nonsense!

390
00:49:59,366 --> 00:50:03,608
A "trap street" has to
blend into its surroundings.

391
00:50:04,682 --> 00:50:06,007
Let me show you...

392
00:50:06,091 --> 00:50:08,991
See how this street curves to the side?

393
00:50:09,366 --> 00:50:11,689
Add another bend at the end.

394
00:50:11,907 --> 00:50:13,946
See how seamless it is?

395
00:50:14,157 --> 00:50:15,354
Here...

396
00:50:16,657 --> 00:50:17,984
Leave me alone.

397
00:50:18,057 --> 00:50:19,547
What are you two doing?

398
00:50:19,631 --> 00:50:21,698
Teaching her to create
a "trap street".

399
00:50:21,782 --> 00:50:22,814
Show-off!

400
00:50:27,866 --> 00:50:31,097
Qiuming,
the manager was looking for you.

401
00:50:33,532 --> 00:50:35,917
- What did he want?
- No idea.

402
00:50:39,906 --> 00:50:41,698
Just say I'm gone for the day.

403
00:50:41,782 --> 00:50:43,240
Tell him yourself.

404
00:50:52,032 --> 00:50:53,312
Hey, you there!

405
00:50:53,991 --> 00:50:56,156
Hello, I'm looking for someone.

406
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:57,394
Come over here.

407
00:51:03,282 --> 00:51:04,820
You have to sign in.

408
00:51:10,281 --> 00:51:11,444
Your ID.

409
00:51:22,531 --> 00:51:24,300
Who do you want to see?

410
00:51:24,657 --> 00:51:25,984
Li Qiuming.

411
00:51:43,781 --> 00:51:45,192
You like it here?

412
00:51:45,407 --> 00:51:46,407
Yes.

413
00:53:05,406 --> 00:53:07,329
You seem different today.

414
00:53:08,655 --> 00:53:10,501
Something good happened?

415
00:53:13,281 --> 00:53:14,589
Tell me about it.

416
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:22,442
Give me your hand.

417
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:29,060
Read it.

418
00:53:33,614 --> 00:53:38,603
Latitude: 32.052° north,
longitude: 118.771° east.

419
00:53:39,365 --> 00:53:42,947
This is where Li Qiuming and Guan
Lifen hold hands for the first time.

420
00:53:43,031 --> 00:53:45,108
Isn't this the second time?

421
00:53:45,781 --> 00:53:47,280
Last time didn't count.

422
00:53:47,364 --> 00:53:48,364
Why not?

423
00:53:50,115 --> 00:53:51,500
There's no reason.

424
00:56:24,155 --> 00:56:25,611
Your watch.

425
00:56:38,279 --> 00:56:41,125
I am not the one you are looking for.

426
00:57:06,029 --> 00:57:07,854
Can I have a cigarette?

427
00:57:41,154 --> 00:57:43,228
Can I sit down for a bit?

428
00:58:08,528 --> 00:58:09,986
Remain standing.

429
00:59:36,736 --> 00:59:38,230
Do you remember me?

430
00:59:40,235 --> 00:59:42,697
Please don't get the wrong idea.

431
00:59:43,277 --> 00:59:46,444
I'm not responsible for
your current situation.

432
00:59:46,528 --> 00:59:48,143
I'm here to help you.

433
00:59:48,611 --> 00:59:50,234
You have to trust me.

434
00:59:52,652 --> 00:59:53,652
Here you go.

435
00:59:55,277 --> 00:59:58,585
I brought you this.
Eat it while it's hot.

436
00:59:59,235 --> 01:00:00,432
Take it.

437
01:00:09,528 --> 01:00:11,444
I have a few questions for you.

438
01:00:11,528 --> 01:00:16,297
Give me honest answers,
and I can explain everything to them.

439
01:00:19,528 --> 01:00:20,558
Come on.

440
01:00:21,028 --> 01:00:22,105
Have a seat.

441
01:00:24,527 --> 01:00:25,527
Come on.

442
01:00:42,652 --> 01:00:46,694
Why did you befriend Guan Lifen?

443
01:00:55,652 --> 01:01:01,652
You bureaucrats.... You always have to
know everything about private matters.

444
01:01:03,027 --> 01:01:04,817
I'm just a scientist.

445
01:01:05,402 --> 01:01:08,981
I don't consider myself
as a bureaucrat.

446
01:01:10,027 --> 01:01:13,873
Besides, very few matters
are completely private.

447
01:01:19,402 --> 01:01:21,227
Let's stay on track.

448
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:26,360
What do you want from her?

449
01:01:28,777 --> 01:01:30,234
Is she in trouble?

450
01:01:31,401 --> 01:01:34,093
She'll be fine as long as you talk.

451
01:01:34,402 --> 01:01:38,693
Better talk here,
rather than somewhere else.

452
01:01:40,902 --> 01:01:42,229
I told you.

453
01:01:42,776 --> 01:01:44,353
I didn't know her.

454
01:01:44,527 --> 01:01:47,989
She was on foot that day,
I gave her a ride.

455
01:01:48,259 --> 01:01:49,500
And after that,

456
01:01:49,584 --> 01:01:51,317
You never saw her again?

457
01:01:51,401 --> 01:01:52,192
I did.

458
01:01:52,276 --> 01:01:54,661
- Still by coincidence?
- Yes.

459
01:01:54,777 --> 01:01:57,193
- Where?
- Outside Forest Lane.

460
01:01:57,277 --> 01:01:59,351
- When?
- At night.

461
01:02:00,109 --> 01:02:01,306
What time?

462
01:02:01,526 --> 01:02:03,815
I'm not sure... around 9pm.

463
01:02:06,027 --> 01:02:08,350
It was 11:46 pm to be precise.

464
01:02:08,984 --> 01:02:11,522
Do you still survey at that hour?

465
01:02:37,609 --> 01:02:38,855
Think harder.

466
01:02:45,485 --> 01:02:51,100
What else do you want me to tell you?
When I got my measles vaccination?

467
01:02:56,976 --> 01:02:59,043
You're the one who's investigating me.

468
01:02:59,127 --> 01:03:02,335
You should tell me
what this is all about.

469
01:03:15,026 --> 01:03:17,488
Can you at least give me a hint?

470
01:03:24,651 --> 01:03:29,882
There's a big difference between
me telling you and you confessing.

471
01:03:47,734 --> 01:03:50,196
You synced your phone with mine?

472
01:03:55,859 --> 01:03:58,474
Don't you know everything already?

473
01:04:09,234 --> 01:04:12,619
What type of institution
is this "Lab 203"?

474
01:04:13,734 --> 01:04:15,503
Our work is classified.

475
01:04:16,358 --> 01:04:18,350
What did my son do?

476
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:23,592
He is suspected of having stolen
state secrets.

477
01:04:23,901 --> 01:04:25,692
Do you have any evidence?

478
01:04:25,776 --> 01:04:28,468
We don't hunt down innocent people.

479
01:04:29,483 --> 01:04:30,859
Did he confess?

480
01:04:31,109 --> 01:04:32,900
That's not your concern.

481
01:04:32,984 --> 01:04:36,215
You should focus on
what you can tell me.

482
01:04:37,026 --> 01:04:38,872
He doesn't live with us.

483
01:04:39,108 --> 01:04:42,031
We only see him once or twice a month.

484
01:04:44,025 --> 01:04:46,317
What kinds of people
does he associate with?

485
01:04:46,401 --> 01:04:47,857
I don't know.

486
01:04:48,983 --> 01:04:50,983
Does he have a girlfriend?

487
01:04:51,608 --> 01:04:52,805
I don't know.

488
01:04:57,276 --> 01:04:59,100
Let me remind you...

489
01:04:59,275 --> 01:05:01,275
As a veteran Party member,

490
01:05:01,525 --> 01:05:04,217
it's in your interest to cooperate.

491
01:05:05,275 --> 01:05:07,275
But I don't know anything.

492
01:05:13,275 --> 01:05:16,044
How much did he pay you back so far?

493
01:05:17,858 --> 01:05:19,935
What are you talking about?

494
01:05:23,025 --> 01:05:26,774
Three years ago, he started a
small business with a partner.

495
01:05:26,858 --> 01:05:29,316
His partner ran off with the money.

496
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:33,228
It was you who covered
his debt of 150,000 yuan.

497
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:43,362
He paid me back about a quarter.

498
01:05:43,608 --> 01:05:44,983
Be precise.

499
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:48,774
Well... we've reached an agreement.

500
01:05:48,858 --> 01:05:52,243
He agreed to pay me back
1500 yuan a month.

501
01:05:52,650 --> 01:05:55,850
It's been 2 years and 4 months now.

502
01:05:57,733 --> 01:06:00,733
Everything you tell me will be checked.

503
01:06:01,650 --> 01:06:04,573
So far your political record is clean.

504
01:06:08,524 --> 01:06:09,852
Anything else?

505
01:06:31,733 --> 01:06:34,566
For the past 2 months,
he's been paying more than usual.

506
01:06:34,650 --> 01:06:35,727
How much more?

507
01:06:36,357 --> 01:06:37,588
2,500 per month.

508
01:06:43,108 --> 01:06:44,570
I don't understand.

509
01:06:47,774 --> 01:06:49,774
What don't you understand?

510
01:06:50,233 --> 01:06:54,771
I've never set foot in Lab 203.
How would I steal secrets?

511
01:07:00,149 --> 01:07:02,223
You must have opened this.

512
01:07:04,525 --> 01:07:07,217
There were two flash drives inside.

513
01:07:09,774 --> 01:07:11,350
I didn't touch them.

514
01:07:15,550 --> 01:07:17,690
Can anyone else
have gotten hold of them?

515
01:07:17,774 --> 01:07:20,227
A colleague?
Your roommate?

516
01:07:20,982 --> 01:07:23,751
I kept the box on me the whole time.

517
01:07:24,024 --> 01:07:25,898
Then it can only have been you.

518
01:07:25,982 --> 01:07:28,601
I told you I didn't touch them.

519
01:07:30,107 --> 01:07:34,729
The night you picked her up,
Miss Guan left work at 7:45pm

520
01:07:36,025 --> 01:07:40,231
You returned the USB sticks
the next day at 9:16pm

521
01:07:41,024 --> 01:07:44,065
Can you prove that you didn't touch them
during these 25 hours?

522
01:07:44,149 --> 01:07:46,436
Can you prove that I did?

523
01:07:47,524 --> 01:07:50,440
It's not me who needs
to prove that you did.

524
01:07:50,524 --> 01:07:53,678
It's up to you to prove
that you didn't.

525
01:07:58,774 --> 01:08:02,466
If I say you stole it,
can you prove otherwise?

526
01:08:29,607 --> 01:08:31,312
You can't do this.

527
01:08:31,824 --> 01:08:33,565
My mother has a heart condition.

528
01:08:33,649 --> 01:08:35,122
I'd rather avoid it too.

529
01:08:35,206 --> 01:08:37,164
She has nothing to do with this.

530
01:08:37,248 --> 01:08:40,762
- Why don't you tell the truth.
- I keep telling you!

531
01:08:45,024 --> 01:08:47,793
- Go and talk to her.
- No, please!

532
01:08:48,648 --> 01:08:50,189
Let me think...

533
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:53,315
It was the USB stick.
It had classified data on it.

534
01:08:53,399 --> 01:08:56,522
You discovered a leak then you
suspect me because I found it.

535
01:08:56,606 --> 01:08:57,721
Keep talking.

536
01:08:58,648 --> 01:09:03,648
But I didn't steal anything or
touch anything. I swear I didn't!

537
01:09:03,899 --> 01:09:06,814
But nobody can prove that.
Who can prove it?

538
01:09:06,898 --> 01:09:09,939
So you gave them to someone else.
Who was it?

539
01:09:10,023 --> 01:09:14,230
Nobody, I swear.
You'd know if I did.

540
01:09:14,649 --> 01:09:18,064
That's it. There would be a trace.
The key must be encrypted.

541
01:09:18,148 --> 01:09:22,226
You'd see if it had been cracked.
Go check it out!

542
01:09:23,731 --> 01:09:25,885
The stick was not encrypted.

543
01:09:27,106 --> 01:09:30,106
How's that possible!
It had to be!

544
01:09:31,607 --> 01:09:32,761
It must have...

545
01:09:38,356 --> 01:09:40,478
Your work is classified...

546
01:09:41,023 --> 01:09:43,792
How can you not encrypt your drives?

547
01:09:44,149 --> 01:09:45,689
That's impossible...

548
01:12:23,397 --> 01:12:25,628
How much for a standard room?

549
01:12:26,105 --> 01:12:28,345
80 yuan per night.

550
01:15:57,145 --> 01:15:58,177
A seven.

551
01:16:00,646 --> 01:16:01,646
A ten.

552
01:16:02,395 --> 01:16:03,675
A King!

553
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:06,020
- Two.
- Your turn.

554
01:16:06,104 --> 01:16:07,061
Pass.

555
01:16:07,145 --> 01:16:08,145
Your turn.

556
01:16:08,603 --> 01:16:09,848
Come on.

557
01:16:11,020 --> 01:16:12,811
- Hurry up.
- Beautiful.

558
01:16:12,895 --> 01:16:14,972
Don't move it... Take this!

559
01:16:15,228 --> 01:16:16,307
Pass.

560
01:16:17,770 --> 01:16:18,770
Pass.

561
01:16:21,270 --> 01:16:22,976
Three of a kind.

562
01:16:23,270 --> 01:16:24,936
You've finished work already?

563
01:16:25,020 --> 01:16:27,635
What work?
There is no more work.

564
01:16:27,853 --> 01:16:29,180
How come?

565
01:16:29,395 --> 01:16:32,186
The company's surveying license
has been suspended.

566
01:16:32,270 --> 01:16:33,550
What happened?

567
01:16:34,103 --> 01:16:37,811
The manager must have pissed someone off.
Or he didn't grease the right palm.

568
01:16:37,895 --> 01:16:40,218
Look how low he's sunk...

569
01:16:41,728 --> 01:16:45,586
Sounds like you didn't grease
the right palm either.

570
01:16:45,670 --> 01:16:46,661
Three Kings.

571
01:16:46,745 --> 01:16:48,645
Did you bring your things?

572
01:16:49,645 --> 01:16:51,683
- Pass.
- Three Kings?

573
01:16:51,895 --> 01:16:53,061
Hold it there...

574
01:16:53,145 --> 01:16:54,342
Three twos!

575
01:16:54,603 --> 01:16:55,978
Take that!

576
01:16:58,978 --> 01:17:00,901
I've had it... Your turn.

577
01:17:01,019 --> 01:17:02,019
Pass.

578
01:17:02,478 --> 01:17:04,478
He wasted his three Kings.

579
01:17:06,103 --> 01:17:07,103
Hang on.

580
01:17:07,895 --> 01:17:09,894
- A straight.
- Nice hand.

581
01:17:09,978 --> 01:17:13,901
I asked the boss to advance you
two weeks' salary.

582
01:17:16,020 --> 01:17:17,477
I owe you money.

583
01:17:20,603 --> 01:17:22,644
- What did you play?
- A suite.

584
01:17:22,728 --> 01:17:24,222
Pass.

585
01:17:26,895 --> 01:17:28,203
A pair of threes.

586
01:17:28,602 --> 01:17:29,847
A pair of nines!

587
01:17:30,644 --> 01:17:33,413
- How many do you have left?
- One.

588
01:17:42,894 --> 01:17:44,352
This is yours.

589
01:17:59,770 --> 01:18:01,096
I know it.

590
01:18:03,478 --> 01:18:05,600
I know why you're fired.

591
01:18:09,477 --> 01:18:11,685
Why did you keep going to Forest Lane?

592
01:18:11,769 --> 01:18:16,000
That's a secret institute there.
It's not on the maps.

593
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:18,096
Didn't you know?

594
01:18:20,644 --> 01:18:23,721
Why did you go there in the first place?

595
01:19:09,102 --> 01:19:10,975
Qiuming, are you there?

596
01:19:12,269 --> 01:19:14,038
Open the door, Qiuming.

597
01:19:14,144 --> 01:19:16,099
It's Mom. Open the door.

598
01:19:19,019 --> 01:19:20,180
Qiuming!

599
01:19:25,352 --> 01:19:26,352
Qiuming!

600
01:19:32,227 --> 01:19:33,227
Qiuming!

601
01:19:58,726 --> 01:20:01,927
He's not home.

602
01:20:03,102 --> 01:20:04,845
Have you seen him?

603
01:20:09,726 --> 01:20:11,682
Do you know where he is?

604
01:20:15,101 --> 01:20:16,347
No way!

605
01:20:17,394 --> 01:20:19,467
- Not bad.
- I put it in.

606
01:20:20,268 --> 01:20:21,346
My turn now.

607
01:20:21,893 --> 01:20:23,433
But I got it in!

608
01:20:25,644 --> 01:20:26,841
Hey, Qiuming!

609
01:20:27,601 --> 01:20:28,601
Look.

610
01:20:29,976 --> 01:20:31,304
Look who's here.

611
01:20:34,393 --> 01:20:35,554
It's you.

612
01:20:37,851 --> 01:20:39,226
Oh, yes...

613
01:20:41,393 --> 01:20:44,593
My cousin made us move back in with him.

614
01:20:45,143 --> 01:20:48,912
I was in a rush,
and forgot to pay you the rent.

615
01:20:49,768 --> 01:20:50,965
Take it.

616
01:20:51,143 --> 01:20:54,592
I came to see
if you have any work for me.

617
01:20:55,643 --> 01:20:58,684
- We need help, don't we?
- Get out of my way!

618
01:20:58,768 --> 01:20:59,846
Now.

619
01:21:05,476 --> 01:21:07,219
Work... well

620
01:21:09,351 --> 01:21:12,847
I've been busy renovating
my cousin's house.

621
01:21:14,143 --> 01:21:15,802
There's no work.

622
01:21:28,517 --> 01:21:30,224
The game's starting.

623
01:21:30,393 --> 01:21:31,932
Join us if you want.

624
01:22:50,642 --> 01:22:53,796
I am in a hurry.
Can I pick up my photo?

625
01:23:20,017 --> 01:23:22,325
It was picked up on Wednesday.

626
01:23:24,267 --> 01:23:25,724
I don't get it.

627
01:23:25,892 --> 01:23:30,354
What don't you understand?
It was picked up and paid for.

628
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:31,845
How can it be?

629
01:23:32,874 --> 01:23:36,241
What's the point of the receipt then,
if anyone can pick it up?

630
01:23:36,325 --> 01:23:38,347
Print another copy then.

631
01:23:39,350 --> 01:23:42,658
Tell me!
Why did you give me this receipt?

632
01:23:42,974 --> 01:23:45,926
It's just a picture, why the big fuss?

633
01:23:46,141 --> 01:23:47,469
You're crazy!

634
01:23:47,725 --> 01:23:50,187
Tell me what the receipt is for?

635
01:23:50,975 --> 01:23:52,667
I want an explanation!
