1
00:05:52,874 --> 00:05:54,179
Hi.
Hi.

2
00:06:04,189 --> 00:06:05,669
I don't think I'm very hungry.

3
00:06:05,713 --> 00:06:06,713
Well, try.

4
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:15,200
Mom?

5
00:06:15,244 --> 00:06:18,595
Do you think I've changed
very much recently?

6
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,312
Well, seeing you from
day-to-day like this,

7
00:06:20,336 --> 00:06:22,686
it's a little difficult
for me to tell.

8
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:25,210
I think I'd notice if you
suddenly sprouted a moustache.

9
00:06:25,254 --> 00:06:26,995
Mom.

10
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:28,170
I mean...
I'm sorry.

11
00:06:28,213 --> 00:06:29,693
My outlook on things,

12
00:06:29,737 --> 00:06:31,608
the basic things.

13
00:06:31,652 --> 00:06:33,610
The problem?

14
00:06:33,654 --> 00:06:36,657
I thought it over, and it's just like Ms.
Cottrell said.

15
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,616
Girls reach
emotional maturity earlier.

16
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,500
And I don't think
Hack's ever going to reach...

17
00:06:42,837 --> 00:06:44,404
Anything, for heavens' sakes.

18
00:06:47,929 --> 00:06:49,689
I'll just have to have it out with
him, that's all.

19
00:06:49,713 --> 00:06:51,802
Simply and definitely.

20
00:06:51,846 --> 00:06:53,456
I'm just going
to have to tell him that

21
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,502
I'm fond of him
in a nice sort of way,

22
00:06:55,545 --> 00:06:57,025
but that there's
a whole lot more

23
00:06:57,068 --> 00:06:58,679
important things in life.

24
00:06:59,854 --> 00:07:01,508
For instance, like other people

25
00:07:01,551 --> 00:07:03,248
who are going places

26
00:07:03,292 --> 00:07:07,035
and doing things
and thinking about things.

27
00:07:07,078 --> 00:07:09,254
It's just an adjustment
he needs, that's all.

28
00:07:12,388 --> 00:07:14,042
And I'll explain it
to him very simply.

29
00:07:14,085 --> 00:07:16,392
Well, I'm sure you can.

30
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,236
Of course, it's good
to talk it over with you.

31
00:07:18,263 --> 00:07:20,962
When you analyze it, it's
really very simple.

32
00:07:21,005 --> 00:07:23,312
Well, I'm glad
I've been helpful.

33
00:07:23,355 --> 00:07:24,855
Sometimes, I think just
talking about it

34
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:27,490
can make you see it
so much more clearly and...

35
00:07:27,534 --> 00:07:29,884
Mom.

36
00:07:29,927 --> 00:07:31,276
Why are you so nervous lately?

37
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,583
I heard you walking
around again this morning.

38
00:07:33,627 --> 00:07:35,067
Couldn't you sleep?
It's nothing.

39
00:07:35,106 --> 00:07:37,413
I'm just over tired I suppose.

40
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,023
Well, it's been ten days or so.

41
00:07:39,067 --> 00:07:40,111
I'm worried about you.

42
00:07:40,155 --> 00:07:41,349
It's really nothing, Randy.

43
00:07:41,373 --> 00:07:42,418
I'm just overtired

44
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,812
and I've been pushed
at the paper.

45
00:07:44,855 --> 00:07:47,075
What you need is
a change, honest.

46
00:07:47,118 --> 00:07:48,903
Well, I've got to go.

47
00:07:48,946 --> 00:07:50,426
Take it easy or you'll crack up.

48
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,254
Age will not wither
and neither the snow,

49
00:07:52,297 --> 00:07:53,516
rain...
No, Mom.

50
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,711
You're younger than anybody.

51
00:07:54,735 --> 00:07:57,389
Even Hack, and that's
almost impossible.

52
00:08:01,002 --> 00:08:03,047
Morning, Juana.

53
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,924
Why any man in his right mind

54
00:08:09,967 --> 00:08:12,840
stays in this godforsaken
country, I'll never know.

55
00:08:12,883 --> 00:08:14,363
Why, even a three-toed sloth...

56
00:08:14,406 --> 00:08:15,669
Morning, Crys.
Morning, Spud.

57
00:08:15,712 --> 00:08:16,776
Morning, Crys.
Wouldn't come within

58
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,280
3,000 miles of this...

59
00:08:18,323 --> 00:08:20,935
Crys, we got to have
some more filler.

60
00:08:20,978 --> 00:08:22,371
All right.
That...

61
00:08:22,414 --> 00:08:23,764
Young idiot phoned.
Who?

62
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,548
The one you had
made county attorney.

63
00:08:25,592 --> 00:08:26,699
I'll call him.
Wanted to know

64
00:08:26,723 --> 00:08:28,135
what to do about
the veteran's housing.

65
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,378
All right.
Why wouldn't he know

66
00:08:29,421 --> 00:08:31,336
about the veteran's housing
for Pete's sake?

67
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,599
I don't know.

68
00:09:03,891 --> 00:09:04,891
Hello, Hack.

69
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,677
Well, hi, Mrs. Benson.

70
00:09:07,721 --> 00:09:09,070
You're coming
to see me? Yes.

71
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:11,551
No bad news, I hope.

72
00:09:11,594 --> 00:09:12,682
Of course not.

73
00:09:12,726 --> 00:09:13,901
Well, even if it was,

74
00:09:13,944 --> 00:09:15,356
I guess a guy could
take it coming from you.

75
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,644
Why, thank you, Hack.
That's a nice thing to say.

76
00:09:17,687 --> 00:09:19,559
Well, even if Randy...

77
00:09:19,602 --> 00:09:21,082
Well, if things
don't work out...

78
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,736
She's acting so funny.

79
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:24,825
Well, if they didn't,
we'd still be friends.

80
00:09:24,868 --> 00:09:26,000
Yes, Hack, we would.

81
00:09:26,043 --> 00:09:27,610
But give Randy a little time.

82
00:09:27,654 --> 00:09:29,177
I reckon.

83
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,700
Hack, I want you
to do me a favor.

84
00:09:30,744 --> 00:09:32,310
Sure, ma'am.
Anything.

85
00:09:32,354 --> 00:09:34,201
I want you to take that envelope
and put your name on it.

86
00:09:34,225 --> 00:09:36,271
And ask Mr. Parker to keep
it in his safe for you.

87
00:09:37,707 --> 00:09:39,927
There's $4,000 in it.

88
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:42,146
If anything... In case
anything should happen to me,

89
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:44,061
I want you to see that
Randy gets the money.

90
00:09:46,324 --> 00:09:47,587
You're sick?

91
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,763
No, it's just one way
of making a will.

92
00:09:49,806 --> 00:09:52,069
And I have a lot more
faith in you than a lot of

93
00:09:52,113 --> 00:09:53,549
lawyers and executives.

94
00:09:54,158 --> 00:09:55,246
That's all, Hack.

95
00:09:56,334 --> 00:09:57,640
There's nothing more.

96
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,035
Okay.
Only...

97
00:10:01,078 --> 00:10:03,037
I don't want anyone
to know anything about it.

98
00:10:04,081 --> 00:10:05,605
You can depend on me.

99
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:34,764
Rubbish.

100
00:10:34,808 --> 00:10:37,332
Ain't the way it was at all.
Complete nonsense.

101
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,116
Hello, Crys.
Hello, Lafe.

102
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,857
What do you mean,
walking way over here?

103
00:10:40,901 --> 00:10:42,139
You could've called
and I'd have come over.

104
00:10:42,163 --> 00:10:43,425
I was out anyway.

105
00:10:43,468 --> 00:10:44,687
You're looking a little peaky.

106
00:10:44,731 --> 00:10:46,646
Handsome as ever,
but a little peaky.

107
00:10:48,256 --> 00:10:49,649
You working too hard?

108
00:10:49,692 --> 00:10:51,172
One thing or another.

109
00:10:51,215 --> 00:10:53,055
You know I notice every
little thing about you.

110
00:10:53,087 --> 00:10:55,219
You take care
of yourself. I will.

111
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,352
Lafe, I want a gun.

112
00:10:59,484 --> 00:11:00,616
Real shooting gun?

113
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,661
Yes.

114
00:11:02,923 --> 00:11:03,923
Fine.

115
00:11:05,969 --> 00:11:07,362
Do I need a permit?

116
00:11:07,405 --> 00:11:09,538
I'll get around to making
that up in a few days.

117
00:11:14,848 --> 00:11:16,545
This one do?

118
00:11:16,588 --> 00:11:17,938
That's a real good shooter.

119
00:11:19,504 --> 00:11:20,767
Here's a couple of magazines.

120
00:11:25,119 --> 00:11:26,903
You know how to use that, Crys?

121
00:11:26,947 --> 00:11:28,339
Why, I think so.
You just...

122
00:11:30,037 --> 00:11:31,734
Point it at whoever
you want to shoot...

123
00:11:33,301 --> 00:11:34,606
And squeeze the trigger.

124
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,434
That's exactly
the way you do it.

125
00:11:36,478 --> 00:11:38,219
Thanks, Lafe.
Don't mention it.

126
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,172
Hi.
Hi.

127
00:12:28,225 --> 00:12:29,270
Aren't you glad to see me?

128
00:12:30,445 --> 00:12:31,968
Sure, I'm glad
to see you, Randy.

129
00:12:41,282 --> 00:12:42,413
Wonderful day.

130
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,810
Hack.
Yeah?

131
00:12:47,854 --> 00:12:49,812
Hack, sometimes
there's a time...

132
00:12:51,074 --> 00:12:53,076
Well, when people have
to be realistic...

133
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,861
And face things.

134
00:12:54,904 --> 00:12:56,079
That's right, Randy.

135
00:12:56,123 --> 00:12:57,777
Things like, relationships

136
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,430
and adjustments and all.

137
00:13:00,301 --> 00:13:01,693
Things kinda...

138
00:13:01,737 --> 00:13:02,738
Out in the air.

139
00:13:03,347 --> 00:13:04,566
Far off like.

140
00:13:05,697 --> 00:13:07,395
You just can't get
your hands on it.

141
00:13:08,657 --> 00:13:09,658
Yeah.

142
00:13:11,225 --> 00:13:13,270
People can't go on
just having fun.

143
00:13:13,314 --> 00:13:14,358
'Course not.

144
00:13:14,402 --> 00:13:15,882
People change.

145
00:13:17,144 --> 00:13:19,276
They grow up,
for heavens' sakes.

146
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,104
Well, I reckon they do, Randy.

147
00:13:21,148 --> 00:13:22,690
And I wish you wouldn't
keep saying "I reckon."

148
00:13:22,714 --> 00:13:23,715
All right.

149
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:25,847
Hack...

150
00:13:27,023 --> 00:13:28,329
I'm fond of you,

151
00:13:28,372 --> 00:13:29,591
very fond of you.

152
00:13:31,071 --> 00:13:32,376
I...

153
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,857
I guess I'd be kind of
dead inside if you weren't.

154
00:13:37,251 --> 00:13:38,687
But you just
have to realize that

155
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:41,255
there's a lot of important
things to think about.

156
00:13:41,298 --> 00:13:43,126
Things going on in the world.

157
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:46,086
People who do things
and think about things.

158
00:13:47,043 --> 00:13:49,829
You have to have a concept.

159
00:13:49,872 --> 00:13:51,787
Yeah. I guess the most
important thing there is

160
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,615
a concept.

161
00:13:53,658 --> 00:13:56,052
It has to do with a person's
integration with the world.

162
00:13:57,793 --> 00:13:58,794
Yeah.

163
00:14:00,491 --> 00:14:03,016
You want to have
anything you can dream of.

164
00:14:04,974 --> 00:14:06,715
I just like to dream
'em up with ya.

165
00:14:08,499 --> 00:14:09,718
But don't you see,

166
00:14:09,761 --> 00:14:12,068
this is your life and all.

167
00:14:12,112 --> 00:14:14,462
If you could just see that
it's a matter of emotional...

168
00:14:15,202 --> 00:14:16,812
A matter of...

169
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,683
Hack, I don't know, sometimes

170
00:14:18,727 --> 00:14:20,598
I think it's impossible
to talk to you.

171
00:14:22,818 --> 00:14:25,560
What are we doing here anyway?

172
00:14:25,603 --> 00:14:27,123
Come on, I'll race you
to the diggings.

173
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,216
Josh!

174
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,045
Hello! Crys?

175
00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:17,742
Yes!

176
00:15:18,178 --> 00:15:19,440
Over here!

177
00:15:27,491 --> 00:15:28,623
Josh?

178
00:15:33,497 --> 00:15:34,759
Josh!

179
00:15:37,806 --> 00:15:38,894
Not there.

180
00:15:41,114 --> 00:15:43,377
I wish you'd label these
rooms instead of...

181
00:15:45,248 --> 00:15:47,598
Letting me rattle
around this labyrinth.

182
00:15:47,642 --> 00:15:49,078
Thought you'd forgotten.

183
00:15:49,861 --> 00:15:51,646
It's creepy in here.

184
00:15:51,689 --> 00:15:54,040
Yeah. Probably hundreds
of eyes watching.

185
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:55,128
Josh!

186
00:15:55,171 --> 00:15:56,825
Used to be a burial chamber.

187
00:15:56,868 --> 00:15:57,957
Come on, I'll show you.

188
00:16:09,751 --> 00:16:11,598
There's some of the stuff
we've taken out already.

189
00:16:11,622 --> 00:16:14,016
Crys, look at these
walls, covered with paintings.

190
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:16,497
They're perfectly beautiful.

191
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,152
Well, they are,

192
00:16:19,195 --> 00:16:20,544
if you like that sort of thing.

193
00:16:21,502 --> 00:16:22,782
Come on, I'll show you the hole.

194
00:16:25,462 --> 00:16:26,507
Careful now.

195
00:16:29,249 --> 00:16:30,249
Listen.

196
00:16:34,689 --> 00:16:36,908
As far as we know, bottomless.

197
00:16:36,952 --> 00:16:39,607
We tried letting a line down
once, ran out of rope.

198
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:41,783
It's the only thing of
its kind ever been found.

199
00:16:41,826 --> 00:16:45,352
Whether they use it as some kind
of ritual burial place or...

200
00:16:45,395 --> 00:16:47,571
Some sort of religious
ceremony, we don't know.

201
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,573
It's a perfectly wonderful hole.

202
00:16:52,054 --> 00:16:53,142
Josh!

203
00:16:53,186 --> 00:16:54,796
Say, maybe they use it

204
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:56,363
as part of
the marriage ceremony.

205
00:16:56,406 --> 00:16:58,756
Put the couple down there
so they could be alone.

206
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,367
And they would be, too.

207
00:17:02,195 --> 00:17:03,370
How about it, Crys?

208
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,241
Josh.

209
00:17:05,981 --> 00:17:07,417
Why, Crys?

210
00:17:07,461 --> 00:17:08,766
Why do you stall on me?

211
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:11,552
I don't.
Yes, you do.

212
00:17:11,595 --> 00:17:13,032
Why can't we settle this?

213
00:17:13,989 --> 00:17:16,731
We will.
No, we won't.

214
00:17:16,774 --> 00:17:18,341
Not unless I can get to you,

215
00:17:18,385 --> 00:17:19,516
really get to you.

216
00:17:20,343 --> 00:17:22,519
Why can't I, Crys?

217
00:17:22,563 --> 00:17:24,217
Why do you keep holding me off?

218
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,915
I don't.

219
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:29,439
I find you looking
at me and smiling.

220
00:17:30,353 --> 00:17:31,528
And there's love there.

221
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,749
Then you catch me
looking at you.

222
00:17:34,792 --> 00:17:36,794
Suddenly there's fear there.

223
00:17:36,838 --> 00:17:39,014
Why, Crys? Tell me,
what's wrong?

224
00:17:39,971 --> 00:17:41,321
No, Josh, no.

225
00:17:42,757 --> 00:17:44,063
That's not true.

226
00:17:45,847 --> 00:17:47,370
I love you, Crys.

227
00:17:47,414 --> 00:17:49,068
Deeply.
I know.

228
00:17:49,111 --> 00:17:50,741
You're the finest thing
that ever happened.

229
00:17:50,765 --> 00:17:52,810
You're rare and good and...

230
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:55,987
I've heard tell
that you're beautiful.

231
00:17:57,424 --> 00:17:58,990
And you love me, too.

232
00:17:59,034 --> 00:18:00,079
I know that.

233
00:18:01,471 --> 00:18:02,516
Then what is it?

234
00:18:03,908 --> 00:18:06,172
Why do I walk around
the fog half the time?

235
00:18:06,215 --> 00:18:07,390
Not knowing where I am,

236
00:18:07,434 --> 00:18:09,784
Not knowing whether
it's night or morning.

237
00:18:09,827 --> 00:18:11,829
Because I'm thinking about you,

238
00:18:11,873 --> 00:18:13,396
asking myself "why?"

239
00:18:14,963 --> 00:18:16,182
There is no "why," Josh.

240
00:18:16,225 --> 00:18:17,835
You're just
making it up yourself.

241
00:18:18,706 --> 00:18:19,794
Then prove it.

242
00:18:31,022 --> 00:18:32,415
Josh, please...

243
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,160
All right, Crys.

244
00:18:39,857 --> 00:18:42,469
Mom!

245
00:18:42,512 --> 00:18:43,731
That sounds like Randy.

246
00:18:43,774 --> 00:18:45,036
Mom!

247
00:18:48,997 --> 00:18:50,390
Hey, what goes on?

248
00:18:50,433 --> 00:18:52,435
Dig up any interesting
characters lately, Mr. Bone?

249
00:18:52,479 --> 00:18:54,045
Well, nothing sensational.

250
00:18:54,089 --> 00:18:55,830
Say, Mom,

251
00:18:55,873 --> 00:18:57,310
can I have some kids
over tonight?

252
00:18:57,353 --> 00:18:59,442
If you promise to stop
calling Josh "Mr. Bone."

253
00:18:59,486 --> 00:19:00,486
It's a deal.

254
00:19:05,709 --> 00:19:06,884
Hello, Hack.

255
00:19:06,928 --> 00:19:07,929
Hello, Mrs. Benson.

256
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,805
You know what?
We saw a man riding today.

257
00:19:14,849 --> 00:19:16,503
Hack insists he was trailing me.

258
00:19:16,546 --> 00:19:18,113
- He was.
- Don't blame him.

259
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,419
Nice, Josh.

260
00:19:20,768 --> 00:19:21,769
Who was it?

261
00:19:22,509 --> 00:19:23,814
I don't know.

262
00:19:23,858 --> 00:19:25,207
Looked sort of city.

263
00:19:25,251 --> 00:19:27,818
A man of infinite charm.

264
00:19:27,862 --> 00:19:30,169
He said I reminded him
of someone he once knew.

265
00:19:30,212 --> 00:19:31,972
Better watch out
for her, Hack. Boy.

266
00:19:31,996 --> 00:19:33,650
She comes from
that kind of a family.

267
00:19:33,694 --> 00:19:35,086
Don't worry, I'll watch out.

268
00:19:38,655 --> 00:19:40,135
Crys?

269
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,963
Yes?
What's the matter?

270
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,487
Nothing. I just remembered

271
00:19:44,531 --> 00:19:46,097
I have to go back to the office.

272
00:19:46,141 --> 00:19:47,708
I'll see you at home
in a little while,

273
00:19:47,751 --> 00:19:49,188
Randy.
Okay.

274
00:20:34,058 --> 00:20:35,408
Randy, my darling...

275
00:20:37,845 --> 00:20:38,933
You'd have to know now,

276
00:20:38,976 --> 00:20:40,500
or in a little while at least.

277
00:20:43,024 --> 00:20:45,983
And I'd like you to hear it
from me in my own words.

278
00:20:47,724 --> 00:20:50,292
So that perhaps you can
understand a little better.

279
00:20:51,946 --> 00:20:53,034
And perhaps...

280
00:20:54,775 --> 00:20:55,776
In time...

281
00:20:57,212 --> 00:20:58,344
You can forgive me.

282
00:21:02,609 --> 00:21:05,046
I'd rather do anything
in the world than hurt you.

283
00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:10,138
Most of all, that's
what's so terrible...

284
00:21:11,226 --> 00:21:12,227
Hurting you.

285
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:16,710
And if it has to be that I'm...

286
00:21:19,582 --> 00:21:21,715
Not here to see you
finish growing up...

287
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,937
Please remember all the fine
years we've had together.

288
00:21:28,635 --> 00:21:29,810
Only those and...

289
00:21:32,552 --> 00:21:34,293
None of the rest that may come.

290
00:21:37,339 --> 00:21:38,339
And...

291
00:21:42,953 --> 00:21:45,173
Please, try not to be
hurt too badly.

292
00:21:49,482 --> 00:21:51,919
This afternoon you told me
so innocently...

293
00:21:53,573 --> 00:21:55,096
That what had
happened to me years ago

294
00:21:55,139 --> 00:21:56,576
had finally caught up with me.

295
00:21:58,795 --> 00:22:00,710
The man you met today,
I'm sure...

296
00:22:02,669 --> 00:22:04,801
Was a man I met 19 years ago.

297
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:08,501
I was just your age.

298
00:22:10,111 --> 00:22:12,026
Or perhaps a few months older.

299
00:22:17,988 --> 00:22:20,208
I'd gone to a dance.

300
00:22:20,251 --> 00:22:22,950
Some neighborhood
political club, I...

301
00:22:22,993 --> 00:22:26,736
Don't remember what it was
or where it was or...

302
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:29,086
I can't even remember
who was there, except...

303
00:22:30,218 --> 00:22:31,785
Mary Rose and... And...

304
00:22:34,091 --> 00:22:35,092
Steve.

305
00:22:37,965 --> 00:22:39,358
The first party dress...

306
00:22:40,141 --> 00:22:41,577
And the first dance...

307
00:22:42,709 --> 00:22:44,406
And the first time
you are in love.

308
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:48,410
It was New Year's Eve.

309
00:22:48,454 --> 00:22:51,718
I remember there were lanterns
of some sort floating above.

310
00:22:52,936 --> 00:22:54,590
The most beautiful lanterns.

311
00:22:55,635 --> 00:22:57,376
And softness all around.

312
00:22:59,247 --> 00:23:01,467
And dancing on a floor
that wasn't there...

313
00:23:02,555 --> 00:23:04,295
In Steve's arms.

314
00:23:06,167 --> 00:23:07,864
I remember how he looked at me.

315
00:23:09,344 --> 00:23:10,693
A slow smile.

316
00:23:12,086 --> 00:23:13,479
And how he held me.

317
00:23:15,263 --> 00:23:16,873
And what his touch did to me.

318
00:23:19,049 --> 00:23:20,616
I don't think we talked,
or if we did,

319
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,923
I never could remember
what we said.

320
00:23:24,228 --> 00:23:26,970
Or how we left Mary Rose,
my best friend.

321
00:23:28,755 --> 00:23:30,017
He drove me home...

322
00:23:30,844 --> 00:23:32,759
In a big foreign car.

323
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,414
He didn't kiss me.

324
00:23:35,457 --> 00:23:36,893
He just smiled and said...

325
00:23:37,503 --> 00:23:38,547
He'd see me.

326
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:40,549
And walked away...

327
00:23:42,072 --> 00:23:45,467
With all of me
wrapped up in his pocket.

328
00:23:45,511 --> 00:23:47,817
I think it was snowing.
I don't know, it was...

329
00:23:48,688 --> 00:23:49,819
It was winter.

330
00:23:51,647 --> 00:23:54,084
And I stood there so long
I became numb.

331
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,785
My mother knew his name
and who he was,

332
00:23:58,828 --> 00:24:01,440
as she knew most of the things
from the gossip of the store.

333
00:24:02,658 --> 00:24:04,443
He was a gangster, she told me.

334
00:24:05,182 --> 00:24:06,445
I didn't believe her.

335
00:24:07,228 --> 00:24:08,447
I couldn't believe her.

336
00:24:10,013 --> 00:24:11,580
I didn't want to believe her.

337
00:24:13,626 --> 00:24:16,280
I wouldn't promise not to see him again.
I couldn't.

338
00:24:17,325 --> 00:24:18,631
It would be like

339
00:24:18,674 --> 00:24:20,981
asking a stone
to float on the sea.

340
00:24:24,332 --> 00:24:26,465
My real name was Xena.

341
00:24:26,508 --> 00:24:27,683
Xena Hale.

342
00:24:28,815 --> 00:24:30,381
And that summer,

343
00:24:30,425 --> 00:24:33,994
it became
Mrs. Steve Blackford.

344
00:24:34,037 --> 00:24:37,693
And we moved into the big brick
house he'd built in Riverside.

345
00:24:37,737 --> 00:24:40,043
I called it Windsor Castle.

346
00:24:40,087 --> 00:24:42,089
I had never seen so many rooms.

347
00:24:43,656 --> 00:24:46,397
After that, it moved so fast,
none of it seemed real.

348
00:24:47,747 --> 00:24:50,097
Except the times
I was alone with Steve.

349
00:24:51,228 --> 00:24:52,839
And fewer and fewer times.

350
00:24:54,928 --> 00:24:56,930
The house was like a...

351
00:24:56,973 --> 00:24:58,932
Merry-go-round
with people getting on

352
00:24:58,975 --> 00:25:01,021
and people
getting off crazily...

353
00:25:01,761 --> 00:25:02,979
With no purpose.

354
00:25:04,938 --> 00:25:08,811
People I'd meet
without knowing who they were.

355
00:25:08,855 --> 00:25:11,945
People who frightened me when I
remembered what my mother kept saying.

356
00:25:17,037 --> 00:25:18,691
It was during this time, Randy,

357
00:25:20,344 --> 00:25:21,911
that I knew I was to have you.

358
00:25:25,567 --> 00:25:27,569
And then, early one morning...

359
00:25:35,185 --> 00:25:37,753
They can't put a finger on me.
We run the town.

360
00:25:37,797 --> 00:25:40,016
You saw that. You saw
how quickly they sprung me.

361
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,081
I wouldn't be surprised if
we could sue them for libel.

362
00:25:42,105 --> 00:25:43,280
Steve,

363
00:25:43,324 --> 00:25:44,891
why did you lie to me?

364
00:25:44,934 --> 00:25:46,414
Did you ever go
through this house?

365
00:25:46,457 --> 00:25:48,155
It's brick.
It's 12 rooms.

366
00:25:48,198 --> 00:25:50,331
We throw parties,
50, 100 people.

367
00:25:50,374 --> 00:25:52,420
Did you ever see me
write out the checks?

368
00:25:52,463 --> 00:25:54,117
We got a car, and a porter job.

369
00:25:54,161 --> 00:25:55,466
A mink coat for you.

370
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:57,381
I wear $100 suits.

371
00:25:57,425 --> 00:25:58,992
I run a cigar store.

372
00:25:59,035 --> 00:26:00,622
A guy comes in and puts
a quarter on the counter,

373
00:26:00,646 --> 00:26:01,821
I give him two cigars.

374
00:26:01,864 --> 00:26:03,997
I make about
three and a half cents.

375
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,128
How many cigars, Xena?

376
00:26:05,172 --> 00:26:07,174
How many, hundreds of thousands?

377
00:26:07,217 --> 00:26:08,697
Xena, you eat a steak,

378
00:26:08,741 --> 00:26:10,066
you don't have to go down
to the slaughterhouse

379
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:11,700
and see the steer killed, do ya?

380
00:26:11,744 --> 00:26:13,624
You don't have to take 'em
to the table with ya.

381
00:26:21,362 --> 00:26:23,582
I was afraid, I guess,
to think about it.

382
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,541
I knew.

383
00:26:27,673 --> 00:26:29,675
I suppose I've always known.

384
00:26:31,502 --> 00:26:32,895
But you were so kind and good.

385
00:26:32,939 --> 00:26:35,115
I didn't think anyone who was
so kind could...

386
00:26:36,812 --> 00:26:37,944
But I was wrong.

387
00:26:38,945 --> 00:26:40,120
Wrong? What's wrong?

388
00:26:40,163 --> 00:26:41,556
How do you know what's wrong?

389
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,384
I run a legitimate business.

390
00:26:43,427 --> 00:26:46,126
I sell cigars and I
collect for the boys.

391
00:26:46,169 --> 00:26:48,607
What they do is
none of your business.

392
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:51,000
And now they've caught you
in a slaughterhouse.

393
00:26:51,044 --> 00:26:52,282
You think I killed that cop?

394
00:26:52,306 --> 00:26:55,004
You've told me
20 times you didn't.

395
00:26:55,048 --> 00:26:57,703
If you'd told me once, I would've known.
If you'd...

396
00:26:57,746 --> 00:26:59,574
If you'd looked at me
when you said it.

397
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,097
If you'd...
If you'd touched me,

398
00:27:01,141 --> 00:27:03,317
Somehow, I don't know how,
but I would've known.

399
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,535
Who are you, Xena?

400
00:27:04,579 --> 00:27:05,972
Who do you think you are, God?

401
00:27:06,015 --> 00:27:07,016
Steve.

402
00:27:07,843 --> 00:27:09,540
You killed that man.

403
00:27:13,893 --> 00:27:15,068
What are you going to do?

404
00:27:17,287 --> 00:27:18,724
I'm not going to do anything.

405
00:27:20,682 --> 00:27:23,598
I didn't want
a mink coat, Steve.

406
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,861
All I ever wanted was
to be near you.

407
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:31,475
I can't say that
it killed my mother.

408
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:33,347
But it was a coincidence.

409
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,828
She died just then.

410
00:27:35,871 --> 00:27:37,177
She wouldn't have liked it.

411
00:27:38,787 --> 00:27:40,963
She wouldn't have liked
all those flowers.

412
00:27:42,443 --> 00:27:43,879
I wish they hadn't sent them.

413
00:27:45,054 --> 00:27:46,534
I'm going to send them back.

414
00:27:46,577 --> 00:27:49,058
Xena, honey, she doesn't know.

415
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,583
No.

416
00:27:52,627 --> 00:27:53,846
Look, honey, why don't you

417
00:27:53,889 --> 00:27:56,022
let me get her things together?

418
00:27:56,065 --> 00:27:59,068
No, I want to do it.

419
00:27:59,112 --> 00:28:01,505
She had six kids and I was
the only one who lived.

420
00:28:07,555 --> 00:28:09,905
This is finished.
You'll come home now.

421
00:28:09,949 --> 00:28:11,994
Mary Rose is
going on a vacation,

422
00:28:12,038 --> 00:28:14,127
and I'm going with her
for the two weeks.

423
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:15,868
All right. Then you come home.

424
00:28:16,738 --> 00:28:18,653
I don't know.

425
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:19,891
Don't look at me like that.
I'll give you

426
00:28:19,915 --> 00:28:21,047
two weeks, that's all.

427
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:22,178
I don't know.

428
00:28:22,222 --> 00:28:23,397
You don't know!

429
00:28:25,747 --> 00:28:26,922
Steve!

430
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,670
She can get over all this.
You see to it.

431
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,585
Two weeks. Then she comes home.

432
00:28:45,027 --> 00:28:46,115
Union Station.

433
00:29:03,829 --> 00:29:04,917
I know him.

434
00:29:05,439 --> 00:29:06,483
Who?

435
00:29:06,527 --> 00:29:08,529
The cab behind.

436
00:29:08,572 --> 00:29:10,313
He used to come to our house.

437
00:29:10,357 --> 00:29:11,445
Following you?

438
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:19,714
Honey, they are never
gonna let you get away.

439
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,150
I've got to.

440
00:29:21,194 --> 00:29:24,197
I've got to get away
where they can't follow me...

441
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,068
Until I know what to do.

442
00:29:33,075 --> 00:29:34,250
Goodbye.
Goodbye.

443
00:29:34,294 --> 00:29:35,295
Hurry.

444
00:29:38,385 --> 00:29:40,343
I ran and kept running.

445
00:29:40,387 --> 00:29:43,129
I had $816.

446
00:29:43,172 --> 00:29:45,696
All my mother had saved
in her lifetime.

447
00:29:51,006 --> 00:29:52,399
I was afraid to stop.

448
00:29:53,356 --> 00:29:56,403
Nights, I slept in buses.

449
00:29:56,446 --> 00:29:59,754
I bought tickets to places I'd never
heard of and tickets back again.

450
00:30:01,016 --> 00:30:02,539
And then...

451
00:30:02,583 --> 00:30:04,628
I couldn't sleep
in buses any longer.

452
00:30:06,065 --> 00:30:08,067
I read about Steve.

453
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:11,461
He'd managed to clear
himself of the killing.

454
00:30:11,505 --> 00:30:14,551
But you don't kill a cop and walk
away with a Good Conduct Medal.

455
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:17,946
You could almost feel
they were waiting.

456
00:30:20,253 --> 00:30:21,820
They didn't have long to wait.

457
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:25,345
Somebody waved another wand,

458
00:30:25,388 --> 00:30:26,389
and they had him...

459
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:28,435
For murder.

460
00:30:29,784 --> 00:30:31,742
The murder of his wife,
this time.

461
00:30:32,961 --> 00:30:33,961
Me.

462
00:30:35,572 --> 00:30:37,009
He'd taken a woman home.

463
00:30:38,967 --> 00:30:42,144
And the next morning,
after he'd left,

464
00:30:42,188 --> 00:30:44,625
she must've been
searching the place

465
00:30:44,668 --> 00:30:48,629
for a little private loot.
At any rate, there was an explosion.

466
00:30:48,672 --> 00:30:50,936
He said he'd had two grenades
in a box in the closet,

467
00:30:50,979 --> 00:30:53,721
and that she must've
accidentally exploded them.

468
00:30:55,418 --> 00:30:59,074
It would've been better
perhaps if he invented a story.

469
00:30:59,118 --> 00:31:01,947
It would've
sounded more convincing.

470
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:03,687
He was a better liar than that.

471
00:31:05,167 --> 00:31:06,690
They said

472
00:31:06,734 --> 00:31:08,736
the pieces of the body
they found...

473
00:31:09,606 --> 00:31:11,739
Were pieces of me.

474
00:31:11,782 --> 00:31:14,394
And that he'd
planned the accident.

475
00:31:15,308 --> 00:31:16,744
Motive?

476
00:31:16,787 --> 00:31:19,660
I'd known too much, run away.

477
00:31:19,703 --> 00:31:21,227
And he brought me back.

478
00:31:25,187 --> 00:31:26,928
Mary Rose.

479
00:31:26,972 --> 00:31:28,408
Xena.

480
00:31:29,626 --> 00:31:31,628
You didn't let anybody know?

481
00:31:31,672 --> 00:31:32,847
You didn't?

482
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:33,892
No.

483
00:31:34,762 --> 00:31:36,416
I...

484
00:31:36,459 --> 00:31:37,983
I think we better sit down.

485
00:31:38,026 --> 00:31:40,159
Xena, you're sick.
No, I'm all right.

486
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:46,184
We'd better get to your room
so I can put you to bed.

487
00:31:46,208 --> 00:31:48,384
I'm all right.
It's not that so much.

488
00:31:49,646 --> 00:31:50,909
Xena, what are you gonna do?

489
00:31:52,388 --> 00:31:53,520
Nothing.

490
00:31:53,563 --> 00:31:54,651
He'll get out of it.

491
00:31:54,695 --> 00:31:56,001
He got out of the other.

492
00:31:56,044 --> 00:31:57,741
He said they owned the town.

493
00:31:57,785 --> 00:32:00,875
Xena, you've
got to go back. I can't.

494
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,181
He'd want my baby.

495
00:32:02,224 --> 00:32:04,618
I couldn't stand him
knowing where I was.

496
00:32:04,661 --> 00:32:07,099
He'd get
the best of me. I...

497
00:32:07,142 --> 00:32:08,622
You've got to
tell them I'm alive.

498
00:32:08,665 --> 00:32:10,580
But they won't be able
to find me.

499
00:32:10,624 --> 00:32:12,278
But you're not able, Xena.

500
00:32:12,321 --> 00:32:13,757
Yes, I am.

501
00:32:13,801 --> 00:32:15,281
They won't believe me.

502
00:32:15,324 --> 00:32:16,475
The other side won't believe me.

503
00:32:16,499 --> 00:32:19,198
That'd be funny, wouldn't it?

504
00:32:19,241 --> 00:32:20,634
They can sentence him to death.

505
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:25,465
Then I'd go back.

506
00:32:26,901 --> 00:32:28,381
I couldn't let him die.

507
00:32:29,686 --> 00:32:30,905
Xena, please.

508
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,951
You've got to
tell them I'm alive.

509
00:32:32,994 --> 00:32:34,865
Mary Rose,
you've got to help me.

510
00:32:34,909 --> 00:32:35,954
See...

511
00:32:35,997 --> 00:32:37,259
See, I... I ran
away from you

512
00:32:37,303 --> 00:32:39,000
at the airport and
you couldn't find me.

513
00:32:39,044 --> 00:32:40,567
Mary Rose,
you've got to help me.

514
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:42,569
Please forgive me. Bye.

515
00:32:54,624 --> 00:32:56,496
Mary Rose was right.

516
00:32:56,539 --> 00:32:57,845
They didn't believe her.

517
00:33:00,456 --> 00:33:02,763
But her story
may have had some effect,

518
00:33:02,806 --> 00:33:03,938
the paper said.

519
00:33:04,504 --> 00:33:05,853
At least,

520
00:33:05,896 --> 00:33:07,594
Steve was let off easy.

521
00:33:08,595 --> 00:33:10,466
He was sentenced to...

522
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:13,165
20 years in the Illinois
State Penitentiary.

523
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,173
I left the bus at Candlewood.

524
00:33:21,216 --> 00:33:23,697
That's as far as I
had money to go.

525
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:24,785
And it looked like a...

526
00:33:25,742 --> 00:33:28,310
Good place to get lost...

527
00:33:29,398 --> 00:33:30,573
And to raise you.

528
00:33:32,532 --> 00:33:33,707
The rest, you know.

529
00:33:39,365 --> 00:33:42,672
You asked me this morning why I'd
been so worried these last few days.

530
00:33:44,718 --> 00:33:47,460
Steve was released on parole
just ten days ago.

531
00:33:49,636 --> 00:33:51,333
Could he find me?
I didn't know.

532
00:33:52,856 --> 00:33:53,857
What would he do?

533
00:33:55,337 --> 00:33:56,556
I could only guess.

534
00:33:58,645 --> 00:34:01,300
The least, I suppose,
would be to...

535
00:34:02,649 --> 00:34:03,650
Kill me.

536
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,741
And now I'm sure he has come.

537
00:34:09,786 --> 00:34:12,528
I'm sure the man
you met today is Steve.

538
00:34:15,836 --> 00:34:16,837
Randy...

539
00:34:19,013 --> 00:34:21,885
These last 18 years...

540
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:24,627
You've given me the greatest
happiness a woman can know.

541
00:34:26,281 --> 00:34:27,282
I'm grateful.

542
00:34:29,415 --> 00:34:30,894
Now you'll have to judge me.

543
00:34:50,958 --> 00:34:51,959
Hello, Xena.

544
00:34:55,441 --> 00:34:56,485
Hello, Steve.

545
00:35:01,229 --> 00:35:02,229
You look fine.

546
00:35:04,624 --> 00:35:06,191
You're quite a girl.

547
00:35:06,234 --> 00:35:08,410
I wondered what you'd say.

548
00:35:08,454 --> 00:35:10,325
But I never
thought that you'd...

549
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,286
You're fine, too.

550
00:35:14,329 --> 00:35:15,678
There's sun on your face...

551
00:35:16,418 --> 00:35:17,680
Under the shadows.

552
00:35:19,508 --> 00:35:21,815
How did you find me, Steve?

553
00:35:21,858 --> 00:35:23,556
There was a picture in
Lifesome months ago,

554
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:25,384
some kids at a rodeo.

555
00:35:26,211 --> 00:35:27,690
One kid took my eye.

556
00:35:28,561 --> 00:35:30,084
A girl who looked like you.

557
00:35:31,259 --> 00:35:33,783
Then there was a woman
in the background.

558
00:35:33,827 --> 00:35:35,568
I hate that picture.
Yes.

559
00:35:37,047 --> 00:35:38,962
Never thought of it.
We were...

560
00:35:39,006 --> 00:35:40,616
Turned so far from the camera.

561
00:35:41,443 --> 00:35:42,618
Not far enough.

562
00:35:43,532 --> 00:35:44,664
Apparently not.

563
00:35:52,628 --> 00:35:53,977
What are you going to do, Steve?

564
00:35:55,675 --> 00:35:57,720
I've given that
some little consideration.

565
00:35:58,591 --> 00:36:00,332
I dare say.

566
00:36:00,375 --> 00:36:02,421
Do you know what I did
in there, Xena?

567
00:36:02,464 --> 00:36:04,292
I was on the shoe bench.

568
00:36:04,336 --> 00:36:07,077
I pounded nails in shoe heels.

569
00:36:07,121 --> 00:36:09,689
Millions of nails.

570
00:36:09,732 --> 00:36:12,082
And every time I pounded
one, I thought of you...

571
00:36:12,648 --> 00:36:13,649
And prayed.

572
00:36:15,042 --> 00:36:16,565
You prayed, Steve?

573
00:36:18,088 --> 00:36:20,613
I prayed, Xena.

574
00:36:20,656 --> 00:36:23,746
I prayed that you were dying
slowly of some disease.

575
00:36:25,487 --> 00:36:27,272
I even dreamed of you.

576
00:36:27,315 --> 00:36:29,404
I'd see you in the
sun on the desert.

577
00:36:29,448 --> 00:36:32,190
Your tongue thick,
and getting thicker for want of water.

578
00:36:33,626 --> 00:36:35,454
I'd see you crawling,

579
00:36:35,497 --> 00:36:37,586
dragging yourself
by your fingernails.

580
00:36:39,153 --> 00:36:41,982
Then I'd see you
in some tropical place.

581
00:36:42,025 --> 00:36:44,114
Tied down.

582
00:36:44,158 --> 00:36:45,681
Ants all over you.

583
00:36:48,031 --> 00:36:49,859
It got so I was
afraid to go to sleep.

584
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,212
Afraid I'd go crazy
just thinking about you.

585
00:36:54,255 --> 00:36:56,257
Are you sure
you're not crazy, Steve?

586
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,217
Very sure.

587
00:37:00,479 --> 00:37:02,350
I'm not the kid I was.
No.

588
00:37:03,308 --> 00:37:04,874
I had to learn.
Yes.

589
00:37:04,918 --> 00:37:07,007
I had a good teacher.
The best.

590
00:37:08,313 --> 00:37:10,706
This is a town I own, Steve.

591
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:11,794
I know all about it.

592
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:14,623
I, cased the place pretty good.

593
00:37:14,667 --> 00:37:15,842
I took my time.

594
00:37:17,409 --> 00:37:19,585
You haven't been sleeping
very well lately, Xena.

595
00:37:21,108 --> 00:37:22,892
Or should I say "Crys"?

596
00:37:24,894 --> 00:37:26,635
Mom? Mom?

597
00:37:27,375 --> 00:37:29,334
No, Randy.

598
00:37:33,207 --> 00:37:34,556
Hello.

599
00:37:34,861 --> 00:37:36,210
Hello.

600
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:37,690
Say, you're the man on the...

601
00:37:37,733 --> 00:37:40,040
You see, you did
remind me of someone.

602
00:37:40,083 --> 00:37:42,434
Crys was just about your
age when I saw her last.

603
00:37:42,477 --> 00:37:43,609
I'm Steve Blackford.

604
00:37:44,305 --> 00:37:45,350
Hello.

605
00:37:45,393 --> 00:37:47,352
I still don't get it.
Should I?

606
00:37:47,395 --> 00:37:48,527
Well, Crys, I didn't think

607
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:49,528
you'd keep me that
much of a secret.

608
00:37:49,571 --> 00:37:51,138
I wasn't that bad.

609
00:37:51,181 --> 00:37:52,444
What's it all about, Mom?

610
00:37:53,401 --> 00:37:54,881
Nothing, dear.

611
00:37:54,924 --> 00:37:57,449
It's just that
it's been so long.

612
00:37:57,492 --> 00:38:00,365
I haven't seen Steve
in so many years.

613
00:38:00,408 --> 00:38:02,367
Eighteen.
More or less.

614
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:03,933
But there's no
big thing about it.

615
00:38:03,977 --> 00:38:05,674
I just startled her, that's all.

616
00:38:05,718 --> 00:38:08,808
And I am a little disappointed
you didn't hear about me.

617
00:38:08,851 --> 00:38:11,550
Turns out I am
your uncle, after all.

618
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,682
No kidding?

619
00:38:13,726 --> 00:38:15,423
No kidding at all.

620
00:38:15,467 --> 00:38:17,295
Here, let me
help you with those.

621
00:38:17,338 --> 00:38:18,992
Say, I've got my bag in the car.

622
00:38:19,035 --> 00:38:20,709
Why don't you ride with me and
show me the way to the house?

623
00:38:20,733 --> 00:38:21,734
Okay.

624
00:39:09,434 --> 00:39:10,585
Can I help you, ma'am?
Yes, Hack.

625
00:39:10,609 --> 00:39:11,890
You can get that
out of the tray for me.

626
00:39:11,914 --> 00:39:12,915
Fine.

627
00:39:16,528 --> 00:39:17,790
You know, I've been thinking.

628
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:22,011
I figure it's gonna take
a college man to hold Randy.

629
00:39:22,055 --> 00:39:24,449
So I'll go to college,
four years.

630
00:39:24,492 --> 00:39:27,626
When I get out,
I got a college education and no dough.

631
00:39:27,669 --> 00:39:29,410
So, if I stay home and work

632
00:39:29,454 --> 00:39:30,977
and save enough money
to marry her,

633
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:33,022
provided some guy
in college doesn't,

634
00:39:33,066 --> 00:39:34,348
then I'm a square
and she won't have me.

635
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,504
Hack. No...
I tell you, you can't win.

636
00:39:36,548 --> 00:39:38,201
No one would ever
call you a square.

637
00:39:38,245 --> 00:39:40,116
Yeah, four-cornered
Hack, that's me.

638
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:43,424
Did you ever consider
wearing shoes?

639
00:39:43,468 --> 00:39:45,078
Instead of boots?
Yes.

640
00:39:45,905 --> 00:39:47,385
That's an odd idea.

641
00:39:47,428 --> 00:39:48,777
Give it a try.

642
00:39:48,821 --> 00:39:50,692
Do you want to help me
pass these? Sure.

643
00:39:50,736 --> 00:39:52,172
Come and get it!

644
00:39:58,744 --> 00:39:59,864
Thank you, Mrs. Benson.

645
00:40:15,064 --> 00:40:16,065
Steve...

646
00:40:17,806 --> 00:40:20,809
You can't hurt her,
you can't twist her life.

647
00:40:22,463 --> 00:40:23,682
She's a nice kid, Xena.

648
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:25,423
Well made.

649
00:40:28,338 --> 00:40:30,210
Anything else, Steve.
Anything at all.

650
00:40:31,298 --> 00:40:32,342
So easy for you.

651
00:40:32,386 --> 00:40:34,127
I don't expect it to be easy.

652
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:35,215
Wise of you.

653
00:40:39,088 --> 00:40:40,438
Just what do you want?

654
00:40:41,569 --> 00:40:42,875
You haven't much money.

655
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:44,616
No.

656
00:40:44,659 --> 00:40:47,227
But as you say,
you own the town.

657
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:48,639
Perhaps you could
raise a collection.

658
00:40:48,663 --> 00:40:50,360
I'm afraid it's the wrong town.

659
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:55,061
Do you think that just money
would pay for the whole deal?

660
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:57,629
Hey, everybody!

661
00:40:57,672 --> 00:40:59,587
Hey! An announcement.

662
00:40:59,631 --> 00:41:01,894
The next dance is
going to be a contest,

663
00:41:01,937 --> 00:41:03,243
and I'm going to be the judge.

664
00:41:07,334 --> 00:41:08,509
She reminds me of you.

665
00:41:10,076 --> 00:41:11,425
The same softness.

666
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,603
I wouldn't want
to see her have your luck.

667
00:41:15,647 --> 00:41:16,909
She's not going to.

668
00:41:17,866 --> 00:41:19,433
She needs a father,

669
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:20,478
as you did.

670
00:41:21,696 --> 00:41:23,568
She'll never have a father.

671
00:41:23,611 --> 00:41:25,308
I'll tell her first.

672
00:41:25,352 --> 00:41:27,223
You wouldn't.
There's a chance.

673
00:41:27,267 --> 00:41:28,573
Always that...

674
00:41:30,009 --> 00:41:31,358
While you're living.

675
00:41:36,755 --> 00:41:39,366
Better in the first place
then, if it's going to be.

676
00:41:39,409 --> 00:41:41,803
People don't work
that way, baby.

677
00:41:41,847 --> 00:41:44,850
Something inside of 'em keeps
them hanging on for the chance.

678
00:41:44,893 --> 00:41:47,113
The one chance of an out.

679
00:41:47,156 --> 00:41:49,202
You'll hang on to that, Xena.

680
00:41:49,245 --> 00:41:52,205
Your mind will be working,
thinking, scheming.

681
00:41:52,248 --> 00:41:54,608
How are you going to cross me,
how are you going to get out.

682
00:41:56,252 --> 00:41:57,993
And I don't underestimate you.

683
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:00,561
You are quite a girl.

684
00:42:02,171 --> 00:42:03,782
There's one small difference.

685
00:42:05,087 --> 00:42:06,698
I've had 18 years.

686
00:42:08,264 --> 00:42:09,657
You'd be amazed at the plans

687
00:42:09,701 --> 00:42:11,441
I've thought up
and thrown away again.

688
00:42:13,705 --> 00:42:15,663
Then I saw
that picture of Randy,

689
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:18,971
and the whole thing
began to fit.

690
00:42:19,362 --> 00:42:20,363
Tight.

691
00:42:23,366 --> 00:42:24,846
So, go ahead.

692
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:26,805
Work on it.

693
00:42:26,848 --> 00:42:28,850
Lie awake at night
and stare at the ceiling.

694
00:42:30,156 --> 00:42:32,462
I like that.

695
00:42:32,506 --> 00:42:33,942
That's just what
I want you to do.

696
00:42:44,866 --> 00:42:46,259
The red checks indicate funds

697
00:42:46,302 --> 00:42:47,782
that are uncollectable.

698
00:42:47,826 --> 00:42:50,176
And the columns added
up wrong indicate...

699
00:42:50,219 --> 00:42:51,481
I'm no good at arithmetic.

700
00:42:52,831 --> 00:42:54,441
Okay, Spud.

701
00:42:54,484 --> 00:42:56,617
Not much of a family
resemblance, is there?

702
00:42:56,661 --> 00:42:57,705
Hello.

703
00:42:57,749 --> 00:42:59,185
Hello, Josh.

704
00:42:59,228 --> 00:43:00,578
That'll be all for now, Spud.

705
00:43:00,621 --> 00:43:02,275
Yeah.

706
00:43:02,318 --> 00:43:04,407
Hi, gravedigger.
Hi, Spud.

707
00:43:04,451 --> 00:43:06,192
Sorry, I didn't know
you were tied up.

708
00:43:06,235 --> 00:43:08,629
I'd like you to meet my
brother, Steve Blackford.

709
00:43:08,673 --> 00:43:09,848
This is Josh Blake.

710
00:43:09,891 --> 00:43:11,545
Hello.
Well, how are you?

711
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:12,783
I didn't know
Crys had a brother.

712
00:43:12,807 --> 00:43:13,807
Not many did.

713
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,116
Crys, if I buy you
a cup of coffee,

714
00:43:17,159 --> 00:43:19,031
can I get some free advice?

715
00:43:19,074 --> 00:43:20,946
Well, I have to be
at the courthouse by ten.

716
00:43:20,989 --> 00:43:22,774
I won't keep you that long.

717
00:43:22,817 --> 00:43:25,559
I've heard that the strong,
silent men of the west were shy,

718
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,605
but isn't this overdoing it?

719
00:43:27,648 --> 00:43:29,648
Do you want me to step
outside so you can kiss her?

720
00:43:31,913 --> 00:43:33,273
I don't think
that'll be necessary.

721
00:43:33,306 --> 00:43:34,350
Don't mind me.

722
00:43:34,394 --> 00:43:35,700
I'm psychic about these things.

723
00:43:35,743 --> 00:43:36,788
Ask Crys.

724
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:38,920
I can even predict the future.

725
00:43:38,964 --> 00:43:40,705
That's not very funny, Steve.

726
00:43:40,748 --> 00:43:42,117
I'm sorry if you're
sensitive about it.

727
00:43:42,141 --> 00:43:44,317
I suppose we're all
sensitive about some things.

728
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,014
And,

729
00:43:46,058 --> 00:43:48,060
take your time
with your deal, Crys.

730
00:43:49,365 --> 00:43:50,584
Come on, Josh.

731
00:43:54,457 --> 00:43:55,458
Good luck.

732
00:43:56,677 --> 00:43:57,677
Thank you.

733
00:44:00,028 --> 00:44:01,639
I never liked him.

734
00:44:01,682 --> 00:44:04,002
Rightly or wrongly,
I was never able to get along with him.

735
00:44:04,032 --> 00:44:05,860
When were kids,
he was always in trouble.

736
00:44:05,904 --> 00:44:07,253
He wanted too many things.

737
00:44:07,296 --> 00:44:09,342
Big house, lots of money.

738
00:44:09,385 --> 00:44:11,823
One way or another,
he always managed to get them.

739
00:44:11,866 --> 00:44:13,955
Then, after mother died,
his great big bubble burst

740
00:44:13,999 --> 00:44:15,435
and he depended on me.

741
00:44:15,478 --> 00:44:17,480
He's convinced I let him down.

742
00:44:17,524 --> 00:44:19,265
Perhaps I have.

743
00:44:19,308 --> 00:44:21,748
What the devil, Crys?
He's a two-legged walking man, isn't he?

744
00:44:21,789 --> 00:44:23,399
He never quite got to be a man,

745
00:44:23,443 --> 00:44:26,446
he's just a confused boy.

746
00:44:26,489 --> 00:44:28,929
Then we'll paddle him on his
backside and send him on his way.

747
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:30,755
I can't, Josh.

748
00:44:30,798 --> 00:44:32,495
He hasn't any place to go.

749
00:44:32,539 --> 00:44:34,149
Yeah?
He wants to stay here with us,

750
00:44:34,193 --> 00:44:35,237
work on the paper with me.

751
00:44:35,281 --> 00:44:36,586
Says I owe it to him.

752
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:38,501
Perhaps I do.
But it's not possible.

753
00:44:38,545 --> 00:44:40,590
I can't have him around Randy.

754
00:44:40,634 --> 00:44:41,635
He's too...

755
00:44:42,505 --> 00:44:44,464
Emotionally unstable.

756
00:44:44,507 --> 00:44:47,293
And I can't very well
warn her about him.

757
00:44:47,336 --> 00:44:48,903
I wouldn't know what to say.

758
00:44:48,947 --> 00:44:50,296
Just as it's...

759
00:44:50,339 --> 00:44:52,907
Difficult to explain it
to you now.

760
00:44:52,951 --> 00:44:55,040
Randy'll like him.
Girls always have.

761
00:44:57,869 --> 00:44:58,869
Crys.

762
00:45:00,088 --> 00:45:01,481
You're telling me
the whole story?

763
00:45:02,830 --> 00:45:04,702
No.

764
00:45:04,745 --> 00:45:06,573
There's a sense of it that he...

765
00:45:06,616 --> 00:45:07,966
Needs to be put in a sanitarium.

766
00:45:08,009 --> 00:45:09,010
No.

767
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:10,925
It's not that.

768
00:45:13,623 --> 00:45:14,712
What do you want me to do?

769
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:16,907
I want to get away from here,

770
00:45:16,931 --> 00:45:18,716
a long way away from here

771
00:45:18,759 --> 00:45:20,195
without anyone knowing.

772
00:45:20,239 --> 00:45:22,676
I'm only two jumps ahead
of the sanitarium myself.

773
00:45:23,459 --> 00:45:25,200
Well, how?

774
00:45:25,244 --> 00:45:27,289
Can you charter
a plane in Albuquerque?

775
00:45:27,986 --> 00:45:29,378
Guess so.

776
00:45:29,422 --> 00:45:30,728
Today's Tuesday.

777
00:45:30,771 --> 00:45:32,904
Randy's school will
be over on Friday.

778
00:45:32,947 --> 00:45:34,882
If you could get it and fly
it in here Friday night,

779
00:45:34,906 --> 00:45:36,603
I could have Randy
at the airfield

780
00:45:36,646 --> 00:45:38,407
without her knowing.
You could fly us to Dallas

781
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:40,694
and then we could get a
regular flight to Mexico City.

782
00:45:41,347 --> 00:45:43,262
Just a cut and run.

783
00:45:43,305 --> 00:45:44,959
Yes, Josh.

784
00:45:45,003 --> 00:45:47,222
He can work on the paper
for the time being.

785
00:45:47,266 --> 00:45:50,182
He won't like it, but it might
give him a sense of responsibility.

786
00:45:51,966 --> 00:45:54,326
And it'd give me a chance to
clear my mind about everything.

787
00:45:56,536 --> 00:45:57,842
I don't much like it, Crys.

788
00:45:58,538 --> 00:46:00,235
Josh, please.

789
00:46:02,194 --> 00:46:03,978
All right.

790
00:46:04,022 --> 00:46:06,720
I can go to Albuquerque tomorrow
night and see if I can arrange it,

791
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:07,939
be back Thursday morning.

792
00:46:16,382 --> 00:46:18,732
He's a nice, open-faced Charlie.

793
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:19,994
How'd he go for the story?

794
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:21,909
What story?

795
00:46:21,953 --> 00:46:24,564
The one you told him.
The sob story.

796
00:46:24,607 --> 00:46:27,610
The one about the brother
you're worried about.

797
00:46:27,654 --> 00:46:30,048
The brother who's
only a little crazy.

798
00:46:30,091 --> 00:46:31,440
What else would you tell him?

799
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:36,358
Tell me.

800
00:46:36,402 --> 00:46:38,056
How have you explained
all these years

801
00:46:38,099 --> 00:46:39,709
that you couldn't marry him?

802
00:46:41,494 --> 00:46:43,626
Or is that even worth
bothering about?

803
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:44,690
It should please you to know

804
00:46:44,714 --> 00:46:46,107
it's been worth a great deal.

805
00:46:48,588 --> 00:46:51,025
I'm a happy man.

806
00:46:51,069 --> 00:46:53,375
The accounts shouldn't
take too much time.

807
00:46:53,419 --> 00:46:56,335
In the old days,
I wasn't a bad collection agency.

808
00:46:56,378 --> 00:46:58,554
You've got 2,300 in the bank.

809
00:46:58,598 --> 00:47:00,208
Here's a check for 2,200.

810
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:02,254
Sign it.

811
00:47:02,297 --> 00:47:04,177
I'll take care of this
week's payroll out of it.

812
00:47:06,519 --> 00:47:09,522
You've been pretty loose,
Crys, with money that is.

813
00:47:21,795 --> 00:47:23,666
But we'll pack
together what we can.

814
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:25,886
This institution of yours

815
00:47:25,930 --> 00:47:27,714
should be worth
a few thousand alone.

816
00:47:28,671 --> 00:47:30,804
We haven't time to sell it.

817
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:32,893
Even if some innocent would buy.

818
00:47:34,112 --> 00:47:35,809
Then there's your
house, it's clear.

819
00:47:37,071 --> 00:47:38,071
Isn't it?

820
00:47:38,943 --> 00:47:39,943
No.

821
00:47:42,511 --> 00:47:44,600
I needed some money
for hospital bills.

822
00:47:46,037 --> 00:47:47,342
You were sick, Crys.

823
00:47:48,561 --> 00:47:49,692
How much is the mortgage?

824
00:47:50,389 --> 00:47:51,651
Four thousand.

825
00:47:51,694 --> 00:47:53,087
Maybe we can raise it.

826
00:47:53,131 --> 00:47:54,393
I'm afraid not.

827
00:47:54,436 --> 00:47:55,829
We can try.

828
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:57,744
They only gave me that
much because it was I.

829
00:47:58,658 --> 00:48:00,442
Because you own the town.

830
00:48:01,661 --> 00:48:03,750
You can try if you like.

831
00:48:03,793 --> 00:48:05,317
I don't think
you'll get anywhere.

832
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:09,060
One thing, Xena.

833
00:48:09,103 --> 00:48:11,540
Don't try any imaginative
stories with Randy.

834
00:48:12,541 --> 00:48:13,605
I don't mind your boyfriend,

835
00:48:13,629 --> 00:48:15,066
but not Randy, understand me?

836
00:48:31,125 --> 00:48:32,953
You brought plenty
of money along, Josh?

837
00:48:32,997 --> 00:48:34,365
On the account
I got two hollow legs,

838
00:48:34,389 --> 00:48:35,627
and you want
to find out anything,

839
00:48:35,651 --> 00:48:36,957
it's gonna take a lot of cash

840
00:48:37,001 --> 00:48:40,482
to get me to the point
where I divulge, as they say.

841
00:48:40,526 --> 00:48:42,267
You're too suspicious, Lafe.

842
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:44,399
Well, I've lived a few years.

843
00:48:44,443 --> 00:48:47,707
Too bad, Josh. I kinda like to
play that game of divulsion.

844
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:49,274
And I like you, too.

845
00:48:49,317 --> 00:48:51,798
On account of yourself,
and on account of Crys.

846
00:48:51,841 --> 00:48:53,800
I'd do anything in the
world for that girl.

847
00:48:55,193 --> 00:48:56,759
You, met her brother?

848
00:48:58,500 --> 00:48:59,849
No, I haven't.

849
00:49:02,026 --> 00:49:03,114
But I heard.

850
00:49:03,766 --> 00:49:05,464
What?

851
00:49:05,507 --> 00:49:06,944
Then we are playing divulsion.

852
00:49:06,987 --> 00:49:08,249
Another round, Harry.

853
00:49:08,293 --> 00:49:10,904
That he was in town.

854
00:49:13,254 --> 00:49:14,995
Yeah, I met him this morning.

855
00:49:16,605 --> 00:49:18,520
It would appear you
didn't take to him much.

856
00:49:21,871 --> 00:49:22,872
Did you?

857
00:49:24,352 --> 00:49:26,224
That one's on you.

858
00:49:26,267 --> 00:49:27,965
One more, Harry.
Got me there all right.

859
00:49:31,446 --> 00:49:32,447
Lafe,

860
00:49:33,187 --> 00:49:35,494
I want to marry Crys.

861
00:49:35,537 --> 00:49:37,617
More than anything in the
world, I want to marry her.

862
00:49:38,627 --> 00:49:39,977
But something's wrong.

863
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:41,500
There's a...

864
00:49:41,543 --> 00:49:44,155
A shadow on the back of her
that's got a hold of her.

865
00:49:44,198 --> 00:49:47,288
I want to find out if that shadow
belongs to that brother of hers,

866
00:49:47,332 --> 00:49:49,421
or who or what
it does belong to.

867
00:49:51,292 --> 00:49:52,815
I got to know, Lafe.

868
00:49:52,859 --> 00:49:54,774
You can't get your
hands on a shadow.

869
00:49:55,644 --> 00:49:57,646
And I want to fight.

870
00:49:57,690 --> 00:49:59,126
I'm glad you told me, boy.

871
00:50:00,562 --> 00:50:02,956
Shadows all got names.

872
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,176
Some of 'em
got fingerprints too.

873
00:50:09,658 --> 00:50:12,009
Well, then he has to have
an unbreakable alibi.

874
00:50:12,052 --> 00:50:13,377
Someone who's caught
in on the money,

875
00:50:13,401 --> 00:50:15,186
or for some reason has to alibi.

876
00:50:15,229 --> 00:50:17,927
What is
all this? Whodunnits.

877
00:50:17,971 --> 00:50:19,973
What would be the best way to do
it, Steve?

878
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:21,931
Say that you wanted
to murder someone.

879
00:50:21,975 --> 00:50:24,630
Well, depends on
the circumstances.

880
00:50:24,673 --> 00:50:27,328
If it were well-planned,
an accident might be best.

881
00:50:27,372 --> 00:50:30,027
Unless the motive were
revenge, let's say.

882
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:32,116
Then you might want
your victim to suffer.

883
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:34,074
What would you do then?

884
00:50:34,118 --> 00:50:36,555
Well, you might figure
out every last way

885
00:50:36,598 --> 00:50:38,426
a person could die,

886
00:50:38,470 --> 00:50:39,819
then figure them all down

887
00:50:39,862 --> 00:50:41,603
to the exact circumstances.

888
00:50:41,647 --> 00:50:43,562
You'd want a slow,
agonizing death.

889
00:50:43,605 --> 00:50:44,693
But specifically...

890
00:50:44,737 --> 00:50:46,130
Randy, that's enough whodunnit.

891
00:50:46,173 --> 00:50:47,566
And you'd better get started.

892
00:50:47,609 --> 00:50:48,915
Okay.

893
00:50:48,958 --> 00:50:50,960
Mom, can we have dinner early?

894
00:50:51,004 --> 00:50:52,658
Steve's taking me to the fiesta.

895
00:50:52,701 --> 00:50:53,939
He's never been
to a fiesta before.

896
00:50:53,963 --> 00:50:55,269
Can you tie that?

897
00:50:55,313 --> 00:50:56,507
I thought you were
going with Hack.

898
00:50:56,531 --> 00:50:58,359
I'd rather go with Steve.

899
00:50:58,403 --> 00:51:01,971
I can show him how much I
know about Mexican customs.

900
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:03,756
Steve says he's a smooth dancer.

901
00:51:03,799 --> 00:51:05,279
That's what the man says.

902
00:51:14,201 --> 00:51:16,203
You got $4,000 on the house.

903
00:51:16,247 --> 00:51:17,683
You got it day before yesterday.

904
00:51:19,467 --> 00:51:20,467
Where is it?

905
00:51:21,165 --> 00:51:22,731
I put it away safely.

906
00:51:24,342 --> 00:51:26,142
Is it intended to be
"going away" money, Crys?

907
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:28,781
No. In the event,
in the unlikely circumstance that

908
00:51:28,824 --> 00:51:30,019
something should happen to me,

909
00:51:30,043 --> 00:51:31,392
it's to go to Randy.

910
00:51:31,436 --> 00:51:32,698
I'll take care of Randy.

911
00:51:34,221 --> 00:51:36,180
That's one thing I'll
never let you do.

912
00:51:43,665 --> 00:51:45,014
She graduates Friday.

913
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:47,756
I'm glad I'll be here to see it.

914
00:51:48,931 --> 00:51:50,083
I'll get a kick
out of seeing her

915
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:52,239
in her new white dress...

916
00:51:52,283 --> 00:51:54,415
Saying goodbye to her
precious girlhood.

917
00:51:55,721 --> 00:51:56,852
I'll be very proud.

918
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:00,900
Tomorrow's Thursday.

919
00:52:00,943 --> 00:52:04,425
I want the 4,000 by tomorrow
afternoon at the very latest.

920
00:52:04,469 --> 00:52:05,818
Have it for me, Crys.

921
00:52:10,997 --> 00:52:12,825
Hi, Hack.
Hi, Mrs. Benson.

922
00:52:15,001 --> 00:52:17,003
I've never seen a handsomer man.

923
00:52:17,438 --> 00:52:18,613
No.

924
00:52:18,657 --> 00:52:20,137
You've never seen a cleaner man.

925
00:52:24,402 --> 00:52:25,596
I wish you'd made
it more definite

926
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:27,013
with Randy.
She has an...

927
00:52:27,056 --> 00:52:28,884
Holy smokes.

928
00:52:33,498 --> 00:52:34,629
Well,

929
00:52:34,673 --> 00:52:35,935
I might've been kidding before,

930
00:52:35,978 --> 00:52:38,111
but really are a killer, killer.

931
00:52:39,721 --> 00:52:41,897
Randy, are you going to
walk down and join us

932
00:52:41,941 --> 00:52:44,161
or do you intend to
float down on a cloud?

933
00:52:48,730 --> 00:52:49,949
Well, what are you doing here?

934
00:52:50,776 --> 00:52:53,082
The fiesta.

935
00:52:53,126 --> 00:52:55,215
Who are you taking?
Now, Randy...

936
00:52:55,259 --> 00:52:57,652
Well, does he think he
doesn't have to make a date?

937
00:52:57,696 --> 00:52:59,306
I didn't say that
I'd go with him.

938
00:52:59,350 --> 00:53:01,047
Did I?
Well, I reckon not...

939
00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:02,329
Randy, sometimes I wish you were

940
00:53:02,353 --> 00:53:03,832
still young enough
to be spanked.

941
00:53:03,876 --> 00:53:05,486
Mom.

942
00:53:05,530 --> 00:53:07,184
Mom, you take Hack.
Maybe you can

943
00:53:07,227 --> 00:53:08,987
teach him something to
do with his feet. I...

944
00:53:10,317 --> 00:53:11,405
Good golly!

945
00:53:11,449 --> 00:53:13,233
What's that, shoes?

946
00:53:13,277 --> 00:53:14,341
Well, what's wrong with...

947
00:53:14,365 --> 00:53:15,690
What's wrong with
me wearing shoes?

948
00:53:15,714 --> 00:53:16,802
Nothing, only...

949
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:19,283
Nothing at all.

950
00:53:19,326 --> 00:53:20,980
I'll bet you'll dance divinely.

951
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:22,634
Come on, killer.

952
00:53:22,677 --> 00:53:23,678
Okay.

953
00:53:27,247 --> 00:53:28,422
See you there, Mom.

954
00:53:30,816 --> 00:53:31,947
I'm sorry, Hack.

955
00:53:31,991 --> 00:53:33,384
It's not your fault.

956
00:53:34,472 --> 00:53:35,647
I'm not too sure about that,

957
00:53:35,690 --> 00:53:37,301
light hair's
the bridal business.

958
00:53:37,344 --> 00:53:38,998
Neither am I.

959
00:53:39,041 --> 00:53:41,914
Perhaps a good, swift right to
the jaw would be better after all.

960
00:54:15,077 --> 00:54:16,775
We'll have to get
you a senorita.

961
00:54:16,818 --> 00:54:18,559
A real pinup girl.

962
00:54:18,603 --> 00:54:20,039
That ought to do the trick.

963
00:54:20,082 --> 00:54:22,389
I like better the idea
of socking a jaw.

964
00:54:23,085 --> 00:54:24,173
That comes later.

965
00:54:26,654 --> 00:54:28,613
How about
a cold drink? Great.

966
00:54:38,187 --> 00:54:39,928
I get it now what you meant by

967
00:54:39,972 --> 00:54:41,713
watching the Stetsons go by.

968
00:54:41,756 --> 00:54:43,541
This is beautiful.

969
00:54:43,584 --> 00:54:45,107
What is?
Well, the big city,

970
00:54:45,151 --> 00:54:47,196
the colored lights.

971
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:48,807
Steve, isn't that wonderful?

972
00:54:48,850 --> 00:54:50,591
What?
Everything.

973
00:54:52,419 --> 00:54:53,594
It is wonderful, Randy.

974
00:54:53,638 --> 00:54:54,726
Root beer?

975
00:54:54,769 --> 00:54:56,510
Two cokes
in bottles. Si.

976
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:00,297
Randy, I...

977
00:55:01,341 --> 00:55:03,169
Wanna talk to you about Crys.

978
00:55:03,212 --> 00:55:04,344
Here you
are, senor.Thanks.

979
00:55:05,214 --> 00:55:06,477
Muchas gracias.

980
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:08,348
Have you, noticed anything?

981
00:55:08,392 --> 00:55:09,392
How?

982
00:55:10,742 --> 00:55:11,786
She's tired.

983
00:55:12,526 --> 00:55:13,788
I know.

984
00:55:13,832 --> 00:55:15,512
She asked me to make
an audit of the paper.

985
00:55:16,182 --> 00:55:17,662
She doesn't want you to know,

986
00:55:17,705 --> 00:55:19,625
but I think it's best if
you're going to help me.

987
00:55:20,229 --> 00:55:21,709
There's a mortgage
on everything.

988
00:55:21,753 --> 00:55:23,842
Only a couple of dollars
in the bank.

989
00:55:23,885 --> 00:55:26,366
I thought... I thought
the paper was a big success.

990
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:27,628
Professionally, yes.

991
00:55:27,672 --> 00:55:29,978
Pats on the back
from the city papers.

992
00:55:30,022 --> 00:55:31,458
But you can't put
them in the bank.

993
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:35,114
Hard, cold cash, no.

994
00:55:35,157 --> 00:55:36,811
Steve, I...

995
00:55:36,855 --> 00:55:38,117
I didn't know.

996
00:55:39,771 --> 00:55:43,427
Trying to juggle everything
by herself is wrecking her.

997
00:55:43,470 --> 00:55:46,517
She's agreed to let me
help financially, but...

998
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,910
More than anything
she needs a rest.

999
00:55:48,954 --> 00:55:50,869
Well, we've tried.
Both Josh and I.

1000
00:55:50,912 --> 00:55:52,740
I know, I know.
It's pride more than anything.

1001
00:55:52,784 --> 00:55:54,655
She won't leave it.

1002
00:55:54,699 --> 00:55:57,397
I'd vote to do what we
can little by little. I...

1003
00:55:57,441 --> 00:56:00,618
I'm going back to Chicago
Friday after your graduation.

1004
00:56:00,661 --> 00:56:01,967
I'll send someone down

1005
00:56:02,010 --> 00:56:04,143
to help and take off the money
pressure, of course.

1006
00:56:04,970 --> 00:56:06,319
Steve.

1007
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:09,757
That's wonderful.

1008
00:56:09,801 --> 00:56:12,107
I thought it would help
if you came to Chicago

1009
00:56:12,151 --> 00:56:13,544
and spent your vacation with me.

1010
00:56:14,936 --> 00:56:18,244
You and Crys are the
only family I have. I...

1011
00:56:18,287 --> 00:56:19,985
I never thought
about it before but...

1012
00:56:21,116 --> 00:56:23,423
Seeing you has
made me realize I've

1013
00:56:23,467 --> 00:56:25,164
always wanted a
daughter of my own.

1014
00:56:26,426 --> 00:56:27,949
Well, I guess every man does

1015
00:56:27,993 --> 00:56:29,211
if he's honest with himself.

1016
00:56:32,476 --> 00:56:33,520
Can I borrow you, killer,

1017
00:56:33,564 --> 00:56:35,261
for part of your vacation?

1018
00:56:37,176 --> 00:56:38,438
Well, I don't know.

1019
00:56:38,482 --> 00:56:39,744
We could have a ball.

1020
00:56:40,527 --> 00:56:42,137
I'll ask Mom.
Of course.

1021
00:56:42,181 --> 00:56:44,096
Boy.
No Stetsons.

1022
00:56:44,139 --> 00:56:45,314
No boots.

1023
00:56:45,358 --> 00:56:46,794
We'll get you some
real sock claws.

1024
00:56:46,838 --> 00:56:49,144
Honest?
We'll knock their eyes out.

1025
00:56:49,188 --> 00:56:50,407
Will we, Steve?

1026
00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:52,496
We'll meet people.
Up-on-their-feet people.

1027
00:56:52,539 --> 00:56:54,323
Boy.

1028
00:56:54,367 --> 00:56:56,543
It'll help Crys
more than you know.

1029
00:56:56,587 --> 00:56:58,284
She can sleep for weeks.

1030
00:56:59,111 --> 00:57:00,939
She's so good, Steve.

1031
00:57:00,982 --> 00:57:02,157
One in a million.

1032
00:57:04,682 --> 00:57:06,466
- Hello.
- Hello.

1033
00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:08,947
Has anyone here
seen Hack's senorita?

1034
00:57:08,990 --> 00:57:11,253
Mom, it's perfectly wonderful.

1035
00:57:11,297 --> 00:57:13,430
What?
We've got it all figured out.

1036
00:57:13,473 --> 00:57:15,301
It'll be good for
everyone, it'll...

1037
00:57:15,344 --> 00:57:17,346
Well, anyway, guess what?

1038
00:57:17,390 --> 00:57:18,609
I don't know. What?

1039
00:57:18,652 --> 00:57:21,742
Steve asked me to spend
my vacation in Chicago.

1040
00:57:21,786 --> 00:57:24,441
He's going to take me to all
the shows and hear music.

1041
00:57:24,484 --> 00:57:25,790
And there's a restaurant

1042
00:57:25,833 --> 00:57:27,966
where... Up on
the 45th floor,

1043
00:57:28,009 --> 00:57:30,185
where there's a breeze from
the lake and very smart.

1044
00:57:30,229 --> 00:57:31,752
The, um,

1045
00:57:31,796 --> 00:57:33,537
Canary Club.
You know it, Mom?

1046
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:35,364
Long time ago.

1047
00:57:35,408 --> 00:57:37,366
We went there together,
didn't we, Steve?

1048
00:57:37,410 --> 00:57:39,368
I didn't know the club
was still running.

1049
00:57:39,412 --> 00:57:41,327
Talk was it was owned
by one of the mobs

1050
00:57:41,370 --> 00:57:43,982
long ago.
You haven't said yet.

1051
00:57:44,025 --> 00:57:45,331
You want to very
much, don't you?

1052
00:57:45,374 --> 00:57:46,724
Yes.

1053
00:57:46,767 --> 00:57:47,942
We'll talk about it later.

1054
00:57:47,986 --> 00:57:49,180
Right now,
you'd better save Hack

1055
00:57:49,204 --> 00:57:50,554
from a fate worse than life.

1056
00:57:52,730 --> 00:57:53,730
Buh-bye.

1057
00:58:05,612 --> 00:58:07,353
Where's Josh tonight?

1058
00:58:07,396 --> 00:58:08,920
He had to go to Albuquerque.

1059
00:58:10,312 --> 00:58:12,750
He was a flyer during the
war, wasn't he?

1060
00:58:12,793 --> 00:58:14,491
Thirty-nine missions over Italy.

1061
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:16,884
What's his next mission,

1062
00:58:16,928 --> 00:58:18,059
an elopin'?

1063
00:58:19,583 --> 00:58:21,541
You're incurably
romantic, Steve.

1064
00:58:21,585 --> 00:58:22,847
Sure I am.

1065
00:58:22,890 --> 00:58:24,109
I'll show you.
No.

1066
00:58:24,152 --> 00:58:25,153
Yes.

1067
00:58:37,731 --> 00:58:38,906
Remind you?

1068
00:58:38,950 --> 00:58:40,952
Of course.

1069
00:58:40,995 --> 00:58:42,867
You always remembered
the lanterns, Xena.

1070
00:58:43,563 --> 00:58:44,563
Here they are.

1071
00:58:51,179 --> 00:58:52,529
I never told you how just

1072
00:58:52,572 --> 00:58:54,748
dancing with you excited me.

1073
00:58:54,792 --> 00:58:56,794
The intimation was there.

1074
00:58:56,837 --> 00:58:58,447
You're a funny little kid.

1075
00:58:59,318 --> 00:59:01,059
Comes a snowy night,

1076
00:59:01,102 --> 00:59:03,278
and the guy meets a kid
in a funny little dress.

1077
00:59:04,671 --> 00:59:06,194
It was a wonderful dress.

1078
00:59:07,587 --> 00:59:09,981
You are the prettiest kid
and the smartest.

1079
00:59:10,024 --> 00:59:11,417
And the one
with the most tricks.

1080
00:59:13,854 --> 00:59:16,640
Just a pale little doll and a...

1081
00:59:16,683 --> 00:59:18,598
Mouth that smiled
like it'd been hurt.

1082
00:59:19,773 --> 00:59:20,837
So that after a while you felt

1083
00:59:20,861 --> 00:59:21,993
the hurt yourself.

1084
00:59:25,170 --> 00:59:26,301
What happened, Xena?

1085
00:59:27,346 --> 00:59:29,000
Why does one girl,

1086
00:59:29,043 --> 00:59:30,175
just one girl,

1087
00:59:31,002 --> 00:59:32,133
get into a man's blood

1088
00:59:32,177 --> 00:59:34,658
so he can't stop
thinking about her?

1089
00:59:34,701 --> 00:59:36,834
So he doesn't want
to do anything cheap.

1090
00:59:36,877 --> 00:59:38,183
But he wants to marry her,

1091
00:59:38,226 --> 00:59:40,489
keep her with him for
the rest of his life...

1092
00:59:40,533 --> 00:59:42,491
Just like it says
in the storybooks.

1093
00:59:44,102 --> 00:59:45,625
What happened between us, Xena?

1094
01:00:09,823 --> 01:00:11,235
When I walked into your
office the other night,

1095
01:00:11,259 --> 01:00:12,347
what did I see?

1096
01:00:13,566 --> 01:00:14,741
You were a pretty kid,

1097
01:00:14,785 --> 01:00:16,917
but you turned into a
really beautiful woman.

1098
01:00:20,921 --> 01:00:22,967
You knew too many
beautiful women, Steve.

1099
01:00:24,098 --> 01:00:26,057
That was your trouble.

1100
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:29,364
Faces and figures,
nothing else there.

1101
01:00:29,408 --> 01:00:31,540
I could pass them in the
street and not know them.

1102
01:00:32,541 --> 01:00:33,586
But I couldn't pass you

1103
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:35,370
3,000 miles away.

1104
01:00:36,241 --> 01:00:37,764
That's what
I'm asking. Why.

1105
01:00:39,548 --> 01:00:41,246
Steve.
Yes?

1106
01:00:44,031 --> 01:00:45,816
Steve, please, for God's sake,

1107
01:00:45,859 --> 01:00:46,904
let Randy alone.

1108
01:00:46,947 --> 01:00:49,297
Just to hurt me, don't hurt her.

1109
01:00:49,341 --> 01:00:50,941
If you're thinking
of what we once had...

1110
01:00:59,525 --> 01:01:02,528
A dame always thinks she still has
it, doesn't she?

1111
01:01:02,571 --> 01:01:04,312
Never thinks it won't work.

1112
01:01:05,487 --> 01:01:06,663
Baby, it's tough enough

1113
01:01:06,706 --> 01:01:08,316
sleeping in the
same house with you.

1114
01:01:19,327 --> 01:01:20,764
All right. Now I know.

1115
01:01:20,807 --> 01:01:22,200
You do.

1116
01:01:22,243 --> 01:01:24,289
Yes. And you know, too.

1117
01:01:25,638 --> 01:01:28,032
There's nothing I
won't do to save Randy.

1118
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:29,729
Fine.

1119
01:01:29,773 --> 01:01:31,426
But tell me...

1120
01:01:31,470 --> 01:01:34,691
You were a dead woman,
legally, 18 years ago.

1121
01:01:35,822 --> 01:01:37,824
What can a dead woman do?

1122
01:03:00,951 --> 01:03:02,735
Randy!

1123
01:03:12,092 --> 01:03:13,311
Mom! Mom!

1124
01:03:13,354 --> 01:03:15,008
It's all right, Randy.
It's harmless.

1125
01:03:17,315 --> 01:03:18,969
Mom.

1126
01:03:22,189 --> 01:03:24,061
Holy moly,
that must've scared you.

1127
01:03:24,104 --> 01:03:26,150
It certainly did.
Well, how'd it get in here?

1128
01:03:26,193 --> 01:03:27,629
I don't know.
It must've come

1129
01:03:27,673 --> 01:03:29,240
from a long line
of porch climbers.

1130
01:03:29,283 --> 01:03:30,632
Why are you still dressed?

1131
01:03:30,676 --> 01:03:32,678
Well, I,
I fell asleep with my clothes on.

1132
01:03:32,721 --> 01:03:35,594
Now you run back
and get into bed.Okay.

1133
01:03:35,637 --> 01:03:38,075
Any more catastrophes,
just call.

1134
01:03:38,118 --> 01:03:40,207
Run along now.
Good night.

1135
01:03:40,251 --> 01:03:41,556
It's morning, almost.

1136
01:03:42,166 --> 01:03:43,166
Good night.

1137
01:04:25,339 --> 01:04:26,906
Hello? Hello.

1138
01:04:26,950 --> 01:04:28,995
Crys?
Yes, Lafe?

1139
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:30,475
Get down here quick.

1140
01:04:30,518 --> 01:04:31,998
Why, what's happened?

1141
01:04:32,042 --> 01:04:34,435
My office. Old Gus Weatherly
just got himself shot

1142
01:04:34,479 --> 01:04:35,523
in the mine.

1143
01:04:35,567 --> 01:04:36,742
Gus?

1144
01:04:36,785 --> 01:04:38,091
Theater in Geronimo.

1145
01:04:38,135 --> 01:04:40,702
Place got broken into
and a lot of stuff gone.

1146
01:04:40,746 --> 01:04:41,878
We got the guy, though.

1147
01:04:41,921 --> 01:04:43,140
Who?

1148
01:04:43,183 --> 01:04:45,446
Mexican kid named Rudolfo.

1149
01:04:45,490 --> 01:04:47,057
Rudolfo? It couldn't be.

1150
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:48,710
Well, get down here and see.

1151
01:04:48,754 --> 01:04:50,408
I'll be right there.
Lafe?

1152
01:04:50,451 --> 01:04:51,452
Yeah?

1153
01:04:52,453 --> 01:04:53,977
How long ago did it happen?

1154
01:04:54,020 --> 01:04:55,500
Do you know what time it was?

1155
01:04:55,543 --> 01:04:57,502
Well, I've been here
about an hour.

1156
01:04:57,545 --> 01:04:58,958
They called me about
an hour and a half ago.

1157
01:04:58,982 --> 01:05:01,419
I'd say roughly about
two and a half hours.

1158
01:05:01,462 --> 01:05:03,160
Why, Crys?

1159
01:05:03,203 --> 01:05:04,726
Nothing. I'll be right there.

1160
01:05:25,704 --> 01:05:28,054
Yes, yes.
That's what they always say.

1161
01:05:28,098 --> 01:05:30,143
- Hello, girl.
- Mrs. Benson.

1162
01:05:30,187 --> 01:05:31,492
She'll do you a lot of good.

1163
01:05:32,015 --> 01:05:33,538
Surely she will.

1164
01:05:33,581 --> 01:05:34,669
Coroner can go to a house

1165
01:05:34,713 --> 01:05:36,584
as easy as he can
an office, can't he?

1166
01:05:38,804 --> 01:05:42,721
If a man gets shot,
seems like his body ought to be sent home.

1167
01:05:42,764 --> 01:05:45,028
Never had a chance,
didn't even have a gun on him.

1168
01:05:46,246 --> 01:05:47,813
Had no time to say anything?

1169
01:05:48,118 --> 01:05:49,249
No.

1170
01:05:49,293 --> 01:05:51,164
Both the other watchmen
heard a blast,

1171
01:05:51,208 --> 01:05:53,384
door of that old strong room
being blown.

1172
01:05:53,427 --> 01:05:54,733
Then they heard three shots.

1173
01:05:55,516 --> 01:05:57,040
When they got there,

1174
01:05:57,083 --> 01:05:58,998
poor old Gus, dead.

1175
01:05:59,999 --> 01:06:01,044
Saw nobody.

1176
01:06:02,523 --> 01:06:03,785
Then they got in touch with me

1177
01:06:03,829 --> 01:06:05,396
and I picked up
some of the boys.

1178
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:08,529
And on the way over
there, we made a sweep.

1179
01:06:08,573 --> 01:06:11,010
Found Rudolfo hiding in the
sagebrush down the bend,

1180
01:06:11,532 --> 01:06:12,664
holding a gun.

1181
01:06:21,325 --> 01:06:22,891
What's missing?

1182
01:06:22,935 --> 01:06:25,198
I don't know how much
until we make a check.

1183
01:06:27,853 --> 01:06:31,161
I ain't never get them boys
to keep their own guns clean.

1184
01:06:33,946 --> 01:06:35,469
Nothing found on Rudolfo?

1185
01:06:36,731 --> 01:06:38,492
That don't prove a thing.
He had plenty of time

1186
01:06:38,516 --> 01:06:39,647
to bury it in the desert.

1187
01:06:39,691 --> 01:06:42,607
Lucky I had sense enough
to make a sweep.

1188
01:06:42,650 --> 01:06:45,131
Said he had a fight with
his girl at the fiesta.

1189
01:06:45,175 --> 01:06:47,264
Came up there in the hills
so he could be alone.

1190
01:06:48,395 --> 01:06:49,570
Fine story, ain't it?

1191
01:06:50,702 --> 01:06:51,746
You want to see him?

1192
01:06:52,704 --> 01:06:53,705
Yes.

1193
01:06:56,403 --> 01:06:58,927
Said he heard the blast,
ran down the road.

1194
01:06:58,971 --> 01:07:00,625
Said he heard
people running rowdy.

1195
01:07:00,668 --> 01:07:03,236
Then he got frightened
and hid in the brush.

1196
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:04,890
Little later,
he said he saw somebody

1197
01:07:04,933 --> 01:07:06,326
running close by.

1198
01:07:06,370 --> 01:07:07,588
That he saw.

1199
01:07:07,632 --> 01:07:09,112
I stand up to go away,

1200
01:07:09,155 --> 01:07:11,766
and I am hit on the head. Hard.

1201
01:07:11,810 --> 01:07:13,507
So, I know nothing more.

1202
01:07:13,551 --> 01:07:16,162
Then I know I am standing
there with this gun

1203
01:07:16,206 --> 01:07:17,206
in my hand.

1204
01:07:18,077 --> 01:07:19,557
I look at it...

1205
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:21,080
I do not know how I have it.

1206
01:07:22,516 --> 01:07:23,952
I think what to do.

1207
01:07:25,302 --> 01:07:26,390
And then he comes.

1208
01:07:26,433 --> 01:07:27,826
Yup. I come.

1209
01:07:27,869 --> 01:07:29,828
Take a look
at his head. Here, you see this?

1210
01:07:32,787 --> 01:07:34,528
Did you see the man?

1211
01:07:34,572 --> 01:07:36,574
It is a truth, I did not.

1212
01:07:36,617 --> 01:07:38,271
Would you recognize his voice?

1213
01:07:39,229 --> 01:07:40,404
He comes up in the dark

1214
01:07:40,447 --> 01:07:41,579
and he does not speak.

1215
01:07:41,622 --> 01:07:43,035
That don't look
like much of a bruise.

1216
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:44,930
He could've got it falling.

1217
01:07:44,973 --> 01:07:47,106
Surely you approve I
do not do these things.

1218
01:07:48,412 --> 01:07:51,023
We'll have to learn more about
it, Rudolfo.

1219
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:52,329
Surely you will help me.

1220
01:07:54,113 --> 01:07:56,115
Yes.
Thank you.

1221
01:08:00,641 --> 01:08:03,122
Folks been a-hintin' I'm
gettin' too old to be sheriff.

1222
01:08:03,166 --> 01:08:04,515
Maybe this'll
change their minds.

1223
01:08:04,558 --> 01:08:06,169
I'm gonna hand 'em
an open-and-shut case.

1224
01:08:06,212 --> 01:08:07,692
He couldn't have done it, Lafe.

1225
01:08:07,735 --> 01:08:10,564
Maybe right now he's got
eyes like a sick cow,

1226
01:08:10,608 --> 01:08:12,305
but have you ever seen
him when he was mad?

1227
01:08:12,349 --> 01:08:13,828
Yes. But even so, I...

1228
01:08:14,655 --> 01:08:15,700
Yes, girl?

1229
01:08:18,355 --> 01:08:19,356
I don't know.

1230
01:08:22,663 --> 01:08:23,664
I don't know.

1231
01:08:41,334 --> 01:08:42,334
Mine business?

1232
01:08:42,770 --> 01:08:45,208
Yes.

1233
01:08:45,251 --> 01:08:47,688
Crys, Rudolfo couldn't have done
that, it's not possible.

1234
01:08:49,821 --> 01:08:51,127
At first thought, yes.

1235
01:08:51,170 --> 01:08:52,606
At any thought.

1236
01:08:52,650 --> 01:08:54,521
He's simple minded
and he's got a temper

1237
01:08:54,565 --> 01:08:56,915
and he's been in trouble
before, but nothing like this.

1238
01:08:56,958 --> 01:08:58,134
He's not a killer.

1239
01:09:00,310 --> 01:09:01,441
Then it's...

1240
01:09:01,485 --> 01:09:04,052
It's an amazing series
of coincidences.

1241
01:09:05,271 --> 01:09:07,099
Have you ever seen
him when he's mad?

1242
01:09:15,499 --> 01:09:17,109
Crys...

1243
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:18,806
Is the same question
on your mind?

1244
01:09:19,938 --> 01:09:20,939
What?

1245
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:23,724
Well, I have to ask it.

1246
01:09:24,986 --> 01:09:26,031
What, Josh?

1247
01:09:29,208 --> 01:09:31,558
You told me there was
something wrong with Steve.

1248
01:09:31,602 --> 01:09:34,692
"Emotionally unstable" were
the words as I remember it.

1249
01:09:34,735 --> 01:09:35,997
Now what I want to know is,

1250
01:09:36,041 --> 01:09:37,173
was Steve home at the time

1251
01:09:37,216 --> 01:09:38,739
this thing happened at the mine?

1252
01:09:40,088 --> 01:09:41,568
Josh, what on earth
are you talking...

1253
01:09:41,612 --> 01:09:43,483
I'm sorry, Crys.
I've got to ask it.

1254
01:09:44,832 --> 01:09:47,357
Yes. He was home.

1255
01:09:48,575 --> 01:09:49,837
I saw him come in.

1256
01:09:50,882 --> 01:09:52,405
I was awake most of the night.

1257
01:09:54,712 --> 01:09:56,714
He came in shortly after we did.

1258
01:09:56,757 --> 01:09:57,932
And he didn't go out again?

1259
01:10:04,112 --> 01:10:05,549
I'm sorry, Crys.

1260
01:10:07,115 --> 01:10:08,116
It's all right.

1261
01:10:09,248 --> 01:10:11,424
Crys, let me take over for you.

1262
01:10:11,468 --> 01:10:13,383
Just get me away from
here, Josh.

1263
01:10:13,426 --> 01:10:15,385
You can see what he's
doing to us already.

1264
01:10:17,256 --> 01:10:19,127
I told you I was awake
most of the night.

1265
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:22,653
He kept going over the old days,

1266
01:10:22,696 --> 01:10:24,132
of how I let him down,

1267
01:10:24,176 --> 01:10:25,308
over and over again.

1268
01:10:25,351 --> 01:10:27,527
It's become an
obsession with him.

1269
01:10:29,007 --> 01:10:31,139
I can't stand much more of it.

1270
01:10:32,793 --> 01:10:35,709
Josh, I can't wait
until tomorrow night.

1271
01:10:35,753 --> 01:10:38,146
Can you get a plane
in the air tonight?

1272
01:10:38,190 --> 01:10:40,801
Yes, of course.
Can you wait at the airfield for us?

1273
01:10:41,324 --> 01:10:42,324
Yes.

1274
01:10:43,108 --> 01:10:44,414
Trust me, Josh.

1275
01:10:47,765 --> 01:10:49,941
Don't baby me
or I'll go completely.

1276
01:10:51,203 --> 01:10:53,249
I want a long time to baby you.

1277
01:10:56,948 --> 01:10:59,429
Juana's here.
Says she's got to see you.

1278
01:10:59,472 --> 01:11:00,560
In a minute.

1279
01:11:05,565 --> 01:11:06,610
If I leave right away,

1280
01:11:06,653 --> 01:11:07,915
I'll make it around nine.

1281
01:11:09,874 --> 01:11:11,005
You'll be all right?

1282
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:13,356
A rock.

1283
01:11:13,965 --> 01:11:15,096
Granite.

1284
01:11:27,674 --> 01:11:28,675
Hey.

1285
01:11:29,981 --> 01:11:31,243
Anybody home?

1286
01:11:50,654 --> 01:11:51,655
Hey.

1287
01:11:53,526 --> 01:11:54,526
Randy.

1288
01:11:55,572 --> 01:11:57,400
It's terrible, Hack.

1289
01:11:57,443 --> 01:11:59,140
Now, don't worry.

1290
01:11:59,184 --> 01:12:00,751
The poor kid.

1291
01:12:00,794 --> 01:12:02,709
Your mother will
get him out of it.

1292
01:12:02,753 --> 01:12:04,102
She'll find out what happened.

1293
01:12:05,146 --> 01:12:06,191
Do you think so?

1294
01:12:06,234 --> 01:12:08,411
Honest?
Sure.

1295
01:12:08,454 --> 01:12:09,803
Your mother can do anything.

1296
01:12:11,805 --> 01:12:13,372
Hack, you know what?

1297
01:12:13,416 --> 01:12:15,200
You're getting to be
almost handsome.

1298
01:12:15,243 --> 01:12:17,245
I'm trying.

1299
01:12:17,289 --> 01:12:19,509
There's gonna be a lot
of guys in Chicago.

1300
01:12:19,552 --> 01:12:22,033
A lot of guys in college, too.

1301
01:12:22,076 --> 01:12:23,716
Some of 'em are going
to be pretty rugged.

1302
01:12:25,558 --> 01:12:27,299
Hack?
Yeah.

1303
01:12:29,432 --> 01:12:32,870
I'm sorry
about last night.Okay.

1304
01:12:32,913 --> 01:12:35,307
I don't know what's the
matter with me anyway.

1305
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:37,570
Sometimes you just need
a good sock on the jaw.

1306
01:12:38,658 --> 01:12:39,659
I guess.

1307
01:12:40,834 --> 01:12:42,880
You know what?

1308
01:12:42,923 --> 01:12:44,447
I'm going to go
to summer school,

1309
01:12:44,490 --> 01:12:45,622
and work nights.

1310
01:12:46,753 --> 01:12:48,929
And I'm going to study ranching.

1311
01:12:48,973 --> 01:12:50,888
And one of these days I'm...

1312
01:12:50,931 --> 01:12:52,716
Going to have a nice
ranch of my own.

1313
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:55,501
I believe you.

1314
01:13:14,041 --> 01:13:15,042
Randy.

1315
01:13:17,349 --> 01:13:18,394
You think it'll work...

1316
01:13:20,570 --> 01:13:22,093
If I stop saying "I reckon"?

1317
01:13:24,095 --> 01:13:25,357
You think you could wait?

1318
01:13:26,750 --> 01:13:27,794
I reckon.

1319
01:14:00,784 --> 01:14:01,784
Mom?

1320
01:14:08,574 --> 01:14:10,184
I've been calling.

1321
01:14:10,228 --> 01:14:11,664
I'm sorry.

1322
01:14:11,708 --> 01:14:12,926
I had to think something out,

1323
01:14:12,970 --> 01:14:14,754
and time just got away, I guess.

1324
01:14:14,798 --> 01:14:15,929
Mom...

1325
01:14:15,973 --> 01:14:18,105
Don't worry.
No.

1326
01:14:18,149 --> 01:14:19,933
I don't care if there
isn't any money.

1327
01:14:19,977 --> 01:14:22,588
I can get a job this
summer and help out.

1328
01:14:22,632 --> 01:14:25,330
I don't care about anything
as long as you don't worry.

1329
01:14:25,373 --> 01:14:27,637
It'll work out, you'll see.

1330
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:29,856
I've got news
for you. What?

1331
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:31,554
I made it up with Hack.

1332
01:14:31,597 --> 01:14:32,990
I'm glad.

1333
01:14:33,033 --> 01:14:34,513
I don't know what
it is about him,

1334
01:14:34,557 --> 01:14:36,210
but I can't do anything with him

1335
01:14:36,254 --> 01:14:38,778
when he looks at me like that.

1336
01:14:38,822 --> 01:14:41,041
And you know, he was right.

1337
01:14:41,085 --> 01:14:43,479
He said that I needed
a good sock in the jaw.

1338
01:14:43,522 --> 01:14:45,916
And I do, too, from both of you.

1339
01:14:45,959 --> 01:14:47,700
And a kick in the pants.

1340
01:14:47,744 --> 01:14:49,572
I've only been
thinking of myself.

1341
01:14:49,615 --> 01:14:50,921
No, dear.

1342
01:14:50,964 --> 01:14:52,749
So, I'm not going
away this summer.

1343
01:14:52,792 --> 01:14:54,402
I'm going to stay and help.

1344
01:14:54,446 --> 01:14:55,795
I couldn't leave you like this.

1345
01:14:56,666 --> 01:14:58,145
I told Steve.

1346
01:14:58,189 --> 01:15:00,496
Ste...
Just now.

1347
01:15:00,539 --> 01:15:03,499
What did he say?
He was mad.

1348
01:15:03,542 --> 01:15:05,892
I didn't know that it
meant that much to him.

1349
01:15:05,936 --> 01:15:08,286
Madder than I could understand.

1350
01:15:08,329 --> 01:15:10,070
I don't know,
he acted sort of funny.

1351
01:15:11,637 --> 01:15:13,334
Mom...

1352
01:15:13,378 --> 01:15:15,467
Hack said that you
could get Rudolfo off.

1353
01:15:15,511 --> 01:15:16,816
Is it true? Can you?

1354
01:15:17,425 --> 01:15:18,949
I'm sure I can.

1355
01:15:18,992 --> 01:15:20,646
You're a wiz, Mom.

1356
01:15:21,952 --> 01:15:23,301
Only...

1357
01:15:23,344 --> 01:15:24,931
I don't want anyone to
know anything about it.

1358
01:15:24,955 --> 01:15:25,955
I won't tell.

1359
01:15:26,783 --> 01:15:28,741
Are you glad I'm staying?

1360
01:15:28,785 --> 01:15:31,962
Yes, Randy.
Very glad.

1361
01:15:32,005 --> 01:15:33,548
Thank you.

1362
01:15:33,572 --> 01:15:35,748
Thank you very much
for what you said.

1363
01:15:41,928 --> 01:15:43,713
It's Steve.
Randy,

1364
01:15:43,756 --> 01:15:45,299
you go home and fix
yourself some dinner.

1365
01:15:45,323 --> 01:15:46,629
I'll be here for a while.

1366
01:15:47,064 --> 01:15:48,065
Okay.

1367
01:15:49,849 --> 01:15:51,111
Hi, Unc.
Hi, kid.

1368
01:15:51,155 --> 01:15:52,678
I'm sorry

1369
01:15:52,722 --> 01:15:54,288
about Chicago and all, honest.

1370
01:15:54,332 --> 01:15:55,333
It's all right.

1371
01:15:59,424 --> 01:16:01,252
You lost that hand.

1372
01:16:01,295 --> 01:16:03,123
You can't force a kid.

1373
01:16:03,167 --> 01:16:05,212
There'll be plenty of time.

1374
01:16:05,256 --> 01:16:07,475
She might be a little
more lonely after a while.

1375
01:16:09,956 --> 01:16:13,612
What else do
you want from me, Steve?

1376
01:16:13,656 --> 01:16:16,006
At the moment,
the four thousand from the mortgage.

1377
01:16:16,049 --> 01:16:18,399
Isn't that petty
cash to you now?

1378
01:16:18,443 --> 01:16:20,184
Whether I need the money or
not, I want it.

1379
01:16:21,011 --> 01:16:22,273
So you don't have it.

1380
01:16:23,666 --> 01:16:25,276
You think I hit that mine.

1381
01:16:27,887 --> 01:16:30,281
Why don't you make
a full confession?

1382
01:16:30,324 --> 01:16:32,675
Write a note, tell about
me, save Rudolfo?

1383
01:16:34,285 --> 01:16:35,634
You won't have to be around,

1384
01:16:35,678 --> 01:16:38,985
watch Randy's eyes when
she finds out about you.

1385
01:16:39,029 --> 01:16:41,292
You can drive off a cliff
with the note in your hand.

1386
01:16:41,335 --> 01:16:42,598
You'll be a heroine.

1387
01:16:45,252 --> 01:16:47,646
The difficulty...

1388
01:16:47,690 --> 01:16:50,127
How could I be sure
it would stick on you?

1389
01:16:52,738 --> 01:16:54,479
That's the difficulty.

1390
01:16:57,438 --> 01:16:59,092
I'll get the money
for you, Steve.

1391
01:17:00,180 --> 01:17:01,834
It'll take me an hour or so.

1392
01:17:05,055 --> 01:17:06,230
Where will you be?

1393
01:17:08,449 --> 01:17:10,234
What's going on?

1394
01:17:10,277 --> 01:17:11,931
What are you trying to do?

1395
01:17:11,975 --> 01:17:13,629
Nothing. I don't know
anything to do.

1396
01:17:13,672 --> 01:17:14,672
Get the money.

1397
01:17:18,895 --> 01:17:20,592
I'll be at the house with Randy.

1398
01:17:54,844 --> 01:17:56,193
Four-two-seven-J.

1399
01:18:01,372 --> 01:18:02,765
Hello?

1400
01:18:02,808 --> 01:18:04,090
Randy, listen to me.

1401
01:18:04,114 --> 01:18:06,072
Do exactly as I say and
don't ask any questions.

1402
01:18:06,116 --> 01:18:07,465
I'll explain later.

1403
01:18:07,508 --> 01:18:09,554
Well, yes, Mother,
but what on earth is...

1404
01:18:09,597 --> 01:18:10,990
Is Steve there yet?

1405
01:18:11,034 --> 01:18:12,122
No.

1406
01:18:12,165 --> 01:18:13,384
Then leave right away.

1407
01:18:13,427 --> 01:18:14,515
Go out by the back patio,

1408
01:18:14,559 --> 01:18:16,213
and make sure
he doesn't see you.

1409
01:18:16,256 --> 01:18:17,780
Well, yes, Mother, but what...

1410
01:18:17,823 --> 01:18:19,738
Randy, listen to me.

1411
01:18:19,782 --> 01:18:22,349
Go to Lafe's office,
and wait for me there.

1412
01:18:22,393 --> 01:18:24,134
Stay with Lafe until
you hear from me.

1413
01:18:25,265 --> 01:18:27,006
He's driving up now, Steve.

1414
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:29,095
Hang up, Randy.

1415
01:18:29,139 --> 01:18:30,793
And run. Hurry.

1416
01:18:30,836 --> 01:18:32,098
Don't let him see you.

1417
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:33,709
Okay.

1418
01:18:57,036 --> 01:18:58,124
Randy?

1419
01:19:06,045 --> 01:19:07,830
Randy!

1420
01:19:07,873 --> 01:19:10,006
Hey, Randy!

1421
01:20:12,633 --> 01:20:13,983
Lafe, this is Josh.

1422
01:20:14,026 --> 01:20:15,158
Yes, boy.

1423
01:20:15,201 --> 01:20:16,855
I've been trying to reach Crys.

1424
01:20:16,899 --> 01:20:18,659
I've called the house and the
office, but there's no answer.

1425
01:20:18,683 --> 01:20:19,858
You don't say.

1426
01:20:21,294 --> 01:20:23,514
You want to go out and admire
the moon a minute, Randy?

1427
01:20:32,175 --> 01:20:34,133
She just called Randy, Josh,

1428
01:20:34,177 --> 01:20:37,006
sent her over here.
Kind of in a panic, the kid said.

1429
01:20:37,049 --> 01:20:38,505
I've been calling around,
trying to get a line,

1430
01:20:38,529 --> 01:20:40,661
I can't get in touch
with either her or him.

1431
01:20:40,705 --> 01:20:42,272
The brother, that is.

1432
01:20:42,315 --> 01:20:44,840
Lafe, I believe
he's a little crazy.

1433
01:20:46,580 --> 01:20:47,930
Worse than that, boy.

1434
01:20:47,973 --> 01:20:49,975
I checked up on him
as you suggested.

1435
01:20:50,019 --> 01:20:51,890
He's got a fine criminal record.

1436
01:20:53,109 --> 01:20:55,285
What do you want me to do?

1437
01:20:55,328 --> 01:20:57,896
I got every reason to
believe he's a killer, Josh.

1438
01:20:57,940 --> 01:20:59,376
That gun we took off Rudolfo

1439
01:20:59,419 --> 01:21:02,292
is the gun I gave Crys,
only two days ago.

1440
01:21:02,335 --> 01:21:04,424
Lafe, does Crys
know about the gun?

1441
01:21:04,468 --> 01:21:06,426
Probably. That's the trouble.

1442
01:21:06,470 --> 01:21:08,124
This brother may have
caught on she knew.

1443
01:21:08,646 --> 01:21:09,647
All ready, Lafe.

1444
01:21:11,692 --> 01:21:13,869
We're starting a sweep.
You come on in.

1445
01:21:13,912 --> 01:21:15,348
We'll find you.

1446
01:21:15,392 --> 01:21:16,523
Now, be careful, boy.

1447
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:21,110
Where's Randy?

1448
01:22:21,153 --> 01:22:22,459
I don't know.
Isn't she at home?

1449
01:22:22,502 --> 01:22:23,547
No.

1450
01:22:23,590 --> 01:22:24,983
Well, at Hack's then.

1451
01:22:25,027 --> 01:22:26,593
Where are you heading?

1452
01:22:26,637 --> 01:22:28,813
I told you, to get the money.

1453
01:22:28,856 --> 01:22:30,423
Where?

1454
01:22:30,467 --> 01:22:32,425
At the Indian diggings. Why?

1455
01:22:36,342 --> 01:22:37,474
I'll ride with you.

1456
01:24:18,575 --> 01:24:19,924
What's the matter?
Nothing.

1457
01:24:19,967 --> 01:24:21,099
Nothing at all.

1458
01:24:29,368 --> 01:24:30,674
Is this it?
Yes.

1459
01:24:30,717 --> 01:24:32,067
The burial chamber.

1460
01:25:10,888 --> 01:25:11,889
No.

1461
01:25:15,893 --> 01:25:17,895
I could have sworn
I crossed here.

1462
01:25:32,605 --> 01:25:33,606
There.

1463
01:26:13,690 --> 01:26:15,909
I can't! I can't!

1464
01:26:16,867 --> 01:26:18,477
Xena.

1465
01:26:18,521 --> 01:26:20,131
Xena!
You're a murderer,

1466
01:26:20,175 --> 01:26:22,916
and you deserve to die!

1467
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:25,919
But I can't give Randy
a murderer for a mother, too.

1468
01:26:29,967 --> 01:26:30,968
Steve!

1469
01:29:04,382 --> 01:29:07,907
Steve!

1470
01:29:07,951 --> 01:29:09,561
Steve!

1471
01:29:34,412 --> 01:29:35,979
Crys. Crys.

1472
01:29:36,022 --> 01:29:37,720
Josh.
Where is he?

1473
01:29:37,763 --> 01:29:39,461
It was terrible.

1474
01:29:39,504 --> 01:29:41,506
He fell over the cliff.

1475
01:29:41,550 --> 01:29:43,595
It's all right, Crys.

1476
01:29:43,639 --> 01:29:45,945
We know your brother
killed old Gus, girl.

1477
01:29:45,989 --> 01:29:48,295
We know you found out
he used your gun.

1478
01:29:48,339 --> 01:29:49,471
Mom!

1479
01:29:49,514 --> 01:29:51,473
Randy.

1480
01:29:51,516 --> 01:29:53,475
Are you all right?

1481
01:29:53,518 --> 01:29:55,868
Yes, I'm all right now.
