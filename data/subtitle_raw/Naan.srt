00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000


3
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,640
He has signed it so well.

4
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,280
You are still so young and already doing forgery!

5
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,200
You have signed for three people.

6
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,680
They cried to me that they have failed

7
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,200
they will receive a thrashing at the house.

8
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,240
So?

9
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,960
Will you sign for them? Stupid!

10
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,480
Sir! Sir!

11
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,840
Henceforth, I will not do it.

12
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,960
It is hurting, sir.

13
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,040
Rascal! Give me his card.

14
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,320
He must have signed this too.

15
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,960
You are a meritorious student.

16
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,680
If you do anything wrong now, your life will be ruined. Rascal!

17
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,480
Go and get your father right away.

18
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,160
Till then, don't permit him into the class.

19
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,400
Don't stand in front of me. Go.

20
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,400
Why are you standing? Go!

21
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,440
Go!

22
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,800
Mother!

23
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,080
Mother!

24
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,320
Karthik has come. Go fast.

25
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,280
Where is my shirt? - It is lying on the floor.

26
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,160
Hey! Didn't you know that he will come early?

27
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,520
You should have told me.

28
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,320
I had no idea. I thought, he'd only come in the evening.

29
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,080
Bye. - Okay.

30
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,600
Don't tell father that Mr. Venkatesan had come.

31
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,400
I will get you whatever you ask for.

32
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,360
Where is our son? Did he eat?

33
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,560
He said that he doesn't want to eat and has gone out to play.

34
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,040
Why do you allow him to play at this time?

35
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,680
You should have slapped him and asked him to study.

36
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,440
Come here. Won't you listen to your mother?

37
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,800
You are sassing me! From where did you learn to do this?

38
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,920
Just question me!

39
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,240
Don't question her if she makes a mistake.

40
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,040
What has happened?

41
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,120
I am asking you. What happened?

42
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,280
Tell me. What has happened?

43
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,280
When I came in this afternoon

44
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,840
Mr. Venkatesan and mother were together.

45
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,400
I did not believe even when the neighbors told me about it.

46
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,440
What are you going to say now? You dog!

47
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,040
If you utter one more word, you will lose respect!

48
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,360
I work hard to take care of your needs. - Really!

49
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,320
If that was the case, why would have I gone to another person?

50
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,840
Are you arguing with me?

51
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,680
Yes, what will you do?

52
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,000
Go, do whatever you can. Go!

53
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,360
Dear!

54
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,320
What will I do?

55
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,480
Dear!

56
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,680
Someone, please come!

57
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,400
You have left me and gone!

58
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,560
You went leaving us behind!

59
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,680
You! What brings you here at this hour?

60
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,520
I am going to Madurai. I'll be back only after two days.

61
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,360
So, I wanted to meet you. - Speak softly. Karthik is sleeping.

62
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,760
Come inside without making any noise.

63
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,560
The house is on fire! Open the door! - Open the door!

64
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,880
Somebody, open the door! - Save us! - Oh! - The house is on fire!

65
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,200
Somebody, open the door! - Please open the door!

66
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,800
Save us! - Save us!

67
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,960
'I'

68
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,400

Come, Karthik.

113
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,920
Sit down.

114
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,240
You are getting released today, right?

115
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,160
So, I called you as I wanted to see you.

116
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,320
You are very studious.

117
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,840
Normally, boys who come here, don't show any interest in academics.

118
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,240
Only education can do us good.

119
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,720
Don't worry about the past, think about the future.

120
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,280
Okay, sir. - I've pinned lots of hopes on you.

121
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,680
The next time, I see you, you should be a changed person.

122
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,720
Okay, sir.

123
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,640
There are few dresses in this. - Thanks, sir.

124
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,600
Keep this money for your expenses. - Okay, sir.

125
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,720
This is all I can afford for now.

126
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,760
I have spoken to your uncle.

127
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,040
Go and see him.

128
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,040
If you need any help, don't hesitate to ask me.

129
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,400
Madi, I had asked for coffee.

130
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,920
I'm getting it. Do I have 10 hands?

131
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,440
Aunt, are you fine? - Yes, I'm fine.

132
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,000
Hello, brother. - Hey, stop playing.

133
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,120
Go inside and study.

134
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,520
Always after me!

135
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,920
Come inside for a moment.

136
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,920
Karthik, have your coffee.

137
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,240
Why has your nephew come here?

138
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,040
Who else does he have?

139
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,240
Are you a fool?

140
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,080
Did you think about our children?

141
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,720
Both of them are young.

142
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,400
If you allow that murderer to stay here

143
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,480
they will get spoilt.

144
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,880
Why are you talking like this?

145
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,200
Then, leave us.

146
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,840
We will go somewhere.

147
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,800
Allow your nephew to stay here and pamper him.

148
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,720
Did you raise him all these years?

149
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,240
Is he a small kid?

150
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,480
Let me know, if you can't tell him. I will go and tell him.

151
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:11,280
I'll call you in the morning. Okay, bye. - Where had you been?

152
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,000
You're completely drenched.

153
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,720
'Chennai, Chennai.. Next, it will stop only in Tambaram.'

154
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,720
'Chennai, Chennai.. Go inside.'

155
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,240
'Chennai, Chennai.'

156
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,440
'The next stop is Tambaram.'

157
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,760
'Chennai, Chennai..'

158
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,720
'Show me your ticket.'

159
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,880
'Go inside and sit.'

160
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,560
Sir, the window seat is mine.

161
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,400
Okay. - Thanks.

162
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,320
Do you remember whatever I said?

163
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,440
Yes, mother. - Go carefully. - Okay, mother.

164
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,640
Call me without fail.

165
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,880
'Oh, no! What has happened!'

166
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,560
'Dear, where are you? - Oh, God!'

167
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,920
'I lost my son. - Oh, my God!'

168
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,640
Mister..

169
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,760
'Please, get up!'

170
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,960
Mister.. - 'Please get up!'

171
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,000
'Oh, God!' - 'Please carry him.'

172
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,000
Mister..

173
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,280
Mister.. Mister..

174
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,800
'Come here!'

175
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:30,640
Sir.. - It's hurting. - Sir, please help me.

176
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,680
I've hurt my hand. Please, sir.

177
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,280
'Come on. Hold his hand.'

178
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,720
I need a room.

179
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,200
How did you get hurt?

180
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,760
Bus accident, sir.

181
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,240
Where are you coming from? - Ramanathapuram.

182
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,440
Where do you work?

183
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,360
I have come here in search of a job.

184
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,800
Can I get a room? - We don't have a single room.

185
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,520
There's a triple cot room. Will you share?

186
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,680
Okay, sir.

187
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,880
Monthly, it will come to Rs.1,500.

188
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,920
Give me your address.

189
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,160
Sir, this is your room. - Okay, sir.

190
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,800
"Even I have a place."

191
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,520
"Even I have a place."

192
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,920
"By the grace of God."

193
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,720
"Even I have a place."

194
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:52,320
"By the grace of God."

195
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,200
"Even I have a place."

196
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,960
Salim. My name is Kumar.

197
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,720
I am looking at your mark sheet.

198
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,800
You will definitely get a medical seat.

199
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,920
You have got very good marks.

200
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,520
By the way, Salim, I have kept your suitcases there.

201
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,720
That is your cot.

202
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,720
Out of curiosity, I saw your certificates.

203
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,480
Are you from Ramanathapuram?

204
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,480
Very good. Even I am from Tirunelveli.

205
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,600
But I married a girl from your place.

206
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,720
Near Paramakudi.

207
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,760
I've relatives near Ramanathapuram.

208
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,120
I visit them quite often.

209
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,640
All that is fine.

210
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,960
Why is your hand bandaged?

211
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,880
I am vacating the room. - Sign here.

212
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,000
Thank you, sir.

213
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,400
You have to give the rent by the 2nd of every month.

214
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,640
Okay, sir. - Else, I will open the room

215
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,040
and throw your things out. - Okay, sir.

216
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,120
What do you do?

217
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,320
I have come to study at the college.

218
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,840
"All wrong deeds are not wrong."

219
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,560
"All right things are not right."

220
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,160
"If you do the wrong things rightly"

221
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,200
"it is not wrong, it is not wrong."

222
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,840
"Open the doors, let me show you something."

223
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,640
"You gotta call me. My name is Salim."

224
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:53,280
"Every day that I keep hunting. Let me go on, let me go strong."

225
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,880
"If Gandhi and Buddha"

226
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,040
"did something wrong and then, reform.."

227
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,200
"Move it, move it, move it, always."

228
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,120
"Every day, I believe that I will be fine."

229
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:06,800
"Someone good in the future, I think, I will be fine."

230
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,320
"All wrong deeds are not wrong."

231
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,080

"Every day that I keep hunting. Let me go on, let me go strong."

237
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,480
"Since snakes are poisonous"

238
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,360
"we get scared and stand far."

239
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,160
"But poor goats.."

240
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,800
"We cook them on the fire."

241
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,640
"When you speak what's right"

242
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,480
"they will call you a coward."

243
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,240
"If you have a knife in your hand"

244
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,800
"they will call you a leader."

245
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,920
"Whenever you tell lies"

246
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,880
"they will say, there's no one like you in the world."

247
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,960
"When you tell the truth"

248
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,800
"they will say, there's not a fool like you in the world."

249
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,160

256
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,560
"Life is a struggle."

257
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,360
"Life is a business."

258
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,160
"If you fall down"

259
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,800
"even the grass will laugh."

260
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,680
"Whichever direction you go in"

261
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,440
"you will be shunned."

262
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,920
"You will be deceived."

263
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,920
"Your heart will break."

264
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,120
"The world"

265
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,880
"wags its tail for money."

266
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,640
"It will encourage the lies."

267
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,720
"It will destroy the truth."

268
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,960
"Let your yearnings abandon you today."

269
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,680
"Let the joys increase."

270
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,840
"Let the curses run away."

271
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,120

283
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,120
Hello.

284
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,280
Not you. You, come here.

285
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,040
What is your name? - Why are you asking?

286
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,000
My hobby is to ask the names of beautiful girls.

287
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,800
Didn't you get it? I am ragging.

288
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,000
Which year are you in?

289
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,160
What is this? You are questioning me constantly.

290
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,080
Don't get scared.

291
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,240
Uma.

292
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,800
'3RD year, M.B.B.S, Bio Chemistry.'

293
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,640
Sir, what is your name?

294
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,680
Sorry, just for fun.

295
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,640
I thought, you were in the first year. Sorry.

296
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,440
If you come late to my class, I will not allow you inside.

297
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,080
May I come in, sir?

298
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,680
Are you late on the first day itself? What is your name?

299
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,760
Ashok. - Come in.

300
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,240
Since it is the first day, I am allowing you inside.

301
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,120
Henceforth, if you are late, you need not come to my class.

302
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,720
Sorry, sir. - What have you worn?

303
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,120
Don't you know, you shouldn't come to the class

304
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,400
wearing casuals and jeans? - Really sorry, sir.

305
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,760
I forgot as I was in a hurry. - Go.

306
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,800
Sir, have I come to a different class?

307
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,920
Is it the first year?

308
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,040
Yes. It is the first year.

309
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,200
Then, have you come to a different class?

310
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,480
The moment I saw you, I thought you to be a senior.

311
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,920
I've come after completing B.Sc. This is my second degree.

312
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,320
Good. So, you must be really studious. I am Ashok.

313
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,440
Salim. - Is there any problem?

314
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,480
Nothing, sir.

315
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,320
Good evening, sir. - Good evening.

316
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,040
My name is Salim, first year student.

317
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,600
I have come from Ramanathapuram. - Okay.

318
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,320
Can I get hostel accommodation? - Is it so?

319
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,680
Have you submitted an application? - Yes, I have.

320
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,360
Late admission? - Yes, sir.

321
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,960
All the rooms are full.

322
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,760
After three months

323
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,320
the PG students will vacate after their semester exams.

324
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,720
You can come and enquire then. - Please, sir.

325
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,880
Okay. - Thank you, sir. - Okay.

326
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,080
Punctured.

327
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,600
Brother, this is Ashok speaking.

328
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,000
I've got a flat tire.

329
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,080
I am in college. Will it take an hour?

330
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,160
Please try to come early.

331
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,000
I have to reform him first.

332
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,960
Do you have a spare tire and the necessary tools?

333
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,400
Do you know how to change a car's tire?

334
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,840
Yes, I do.

335
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,560
Are you Ashok?

336
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,480
What! Do you think yourself to be great? - Me?

337
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,400
It has been just two days since you came to college.

338
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,800
How dare you rag a senior girl!

339
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,160
I teased a senior girl?

340
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,400
Sorry, sir. I guess, you've misunderstood.

341
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,120
You are Ashok, aren't you?

342
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,840
Ashok! Who me?

343
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,960
Hey, are you Ashok?

344
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,160
Are you Ashok? You told me, you are Salim.

345
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,680
What is it? Arrogance?

346
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,200
What are you staring at me for?

347
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,680
Being sarcastic!

348
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,800
Hey, who is Ashok between the two of you?

349
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,400
Sorry, sir.

350
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,520
He did it unknowingly.

351
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,120
It was a mistake indeed. Forgive him.

352
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,440
Forgive him! Are you both playing the fool?

353
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,680
I'll hit you!

354
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,000
I did apologize. Then, why?

355
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,280
You have raised your hand at me!

356
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,720
I will teach you a lesson.

357
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,000
I will not spare you.

358
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,120
Bye, Ashok. See you in the morning.

359
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,320
Hey, where are you going? Get in the car. I will drop you.

360
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,800
It is okay, Ashok. I will take the bus.

361
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,160
The person who went now, may come back with his men.

362
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,120
Why do you want to get caught? Get in.

363
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,640
Senthil, this is not good.

364
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,760
You haven't paid rent for the last two months.

365
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,720
Am I running a charitable institution here?

366
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,040
Salim!

367
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,760
Please come here.

368
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,360
You came in, but the moment you saw me, you're making an exit.

369
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,800
Sorry, sir. Somebody is waiting outside.

370
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,000
What did I tell you when you came here?

371
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,880
You said that I must pay the rent by the 2nd of every month.

372
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,200
Do you remember? - Yes.

373
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,600
You are studying medicine. I thought, you will be punctual.

374
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,760
Tomorrow is the eighth.

375
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Sorry, sir.

376
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,520
I will give it to you in a week. - Salim..

377
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,720
Don't make me angry.

378
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,280
I won't wait for a week.

379
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,040
Within two days, if I don't get the rent

380
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,840
I will throw your bags away.

381
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,680
Don't feel sorry at that time.

382
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,760
Okay, sir. I will give it to you.

383
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,760
I have told the manager. Vacate immediately.

384
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,600
He said somebody is waiting outside, but he is going upstairs.

385
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,160
'Within two days if I don't get the rent'

386
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,160
'I will throw your bags away.'

387
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,480
Salim..

388
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,360
Hang on, I'll be back soon.

389
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:54,640
There's one guy coming here. What is it? Ragging again?

390
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,560
You ran away when I asked your name.

391
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,680
Temerity, is it?

392
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,440
Did I misbehave with you?

393
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,400
I felt like talking to you as you are beautiful.

394
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,400
Will you send your men to hit me for that?

395
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,440
Do you think I will get scared?

396
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,400
What are you saying? Did I send men to hit you?

397
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,120
Actually, I.. - Hey! Who is that man?

398
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,240
Is he your friend or boyfriend?

399
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,320
He is talking about Satish.

400
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,800
Why did he go to him?

401
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,120
Hello, look at me and talk.

402
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,120
I never complained about anything to anybody.

403
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,160
If somebody came and fought with you because of me

404
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,600
I am sorry. Okay?

405
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,280
If you say sorry, will it be set right?

406
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,520
What else do you want me to do?

407
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,040
Offer coffee.

408
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,360
Thanks.

409
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,040
You are very bold. What is your name?

410
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,120
Ashok.

411
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,960
You are proposing a senior without any fear.

412
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,240
You are telling me that I am beautiful.

413
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,000
I am telling the truth.

414
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,040
We have something personal to speak. You..

415
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,360
Then, you drop her.

416
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,200
Rekha, wait, I am also coming with you.

417
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,000
Ashok, are you kidding?

418
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,720
If she goes, I'll have to walk back.

419
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,000
Too good. Let her go. I will drop you.

420
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,560
That's not required. Give that bag. It is getting late.

421
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,040
Okay, I am not kidding. I am serious.

422
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,880
If you accept my friendship, come with me.

423
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,920
Otherwise, take this.

424
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,440
You can say goodbye right away and leave.

425
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,080
Bye, Salim. See you later.

426
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,320
Bye, Ashok.

427
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,080
It's not even been a month since you joined

428
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,320
and you already need an advance?

429
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,480
I'm in need of it, sir.

430
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,440
Attend to that corner table.

431
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,960

00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,000
Salim, do you work here? - Yes, sir.

433
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,640
It's a part time job.

434
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,560
There are some problems at home.

435
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,200
So, I've decided to take care of my expenses.

436
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,520
You can do a job which is related to your studies.

437
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,640
If there is any such job, let me know, sir. I will do it.

438
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,440
Good. Senior students are helping me in my research.

439
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,200
You may have to refer to books. Come along.

440
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,040
Thank you, sir. - Welcome.

441
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,800

442
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,560
Hello. Hi, Salim, tell me. - Ashok, Salim speaking.

00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,800
You have to do me a small favor.

444
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,920
Tell me. - I have to pay the rent.

445
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,680
I will return it to you as soon as I get my salary.

446
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,160
How much? - Rs.2000.

00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,640

Are you done with the work you'd come here for?

505
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,520
Did anything spill over you? - No. - Dude..

506
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,240
I spilled everything here only. - He is telling it so proudly!

507
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,720
Suresh.

508
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,520
Suresh, I'd asked for a servant. What happened?

509
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,680
Only if something like this happens

510
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,760
will you remember about the servant.

511
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,000
I'm enquiring for one. I haven't got anyone yet.

512
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,080
Sundar has lost control. Drop him home.

513
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,360
I have to drop them too. Can he walk?

514
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,480
Look, he is coming.

515
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,400
Dude..

516
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,920
Is the party over?

517
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,280
See you. - Bye.

518
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,600
He is drunk.

519
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,080
Do you have something left?

520
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,520
Yes, there's your vomit. Take it if you want.

521
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,840
Happy birthday.

522
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:56,280
Brother, happy birthday. - Take him.

523
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,840
Hey, will you not get liquor tomorrow?

524
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,440
Why do you hold me and walk?

525
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,480
How did you come?

526
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,520
By bus.

527
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,640
It is late. You will not get any bus now.

528
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,840
Stay back and leave in the morning.

529
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,560
Okay. - Nice to meet you, Salim.

530
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,120
Wait here, I will be back.

531
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,280
Salim.

532
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:47,080
Did you clean all this up? - Yes, Ashok. I was waiting for you to wake up.

533
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,960
You were saying, you don't have a servant.

534
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,400
I was feeling bored too.

535
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,880
So, I decided to do it myself.

536
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,880
Thanks. Leave everything. You come.

537
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,960
It is done, Ashok.

538
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,960
Did you wake up just now? - Yes.

539
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,600
Good morning, Salim. - Good morning.

540
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,520
Rupa, can you see any difference?

541
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,000
Difference?

542
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,280
I can see the effect of Salim's stay.

543
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:17,400
Salim, why don't you stay here with Ashok?

544
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,880
What do you say, Ashok?

545
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,240
Yeah.

546
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,240
Salim, vacate the mansion and come here.

547
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,880
Yeah.

548
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,040
Silence means he has agreed.

549
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,600
Okay.

550
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,520
Let's go this way.

551
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,720
Ashok!

552
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,040
I will go by bus.

553
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,320
Are you kidding me?

554
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,520
Wait, I will come.

555
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,880
Ashok

556
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,400
I want to talk to you.

557
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,920
Why are you avoiding me?

558
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,560
I have expressed myself quite clearly.

559
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,000
There's nothing left to talk.

560
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,080
You came to me on your own.

561
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,200
You said, you liked me.

562
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,680
Now, all of a sudden, why don't you like me?

563
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,360
I didn't like it when you said, you loved me.

564
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,760
It is true that I liked you and mingled with you.

565
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,560
But that does not mean that I love you.

566
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,840
I was just being friendly

567
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,680
but I never expected you to take it so seriously.

568
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,440
No, you are confusing me with your talk.

569
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,800
If I've done anything wrong.. - Uma, you are confused.

570
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,120
Understand. Think of our age.

571
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,640
Don't tell anyone that you love me the way you told me.

572
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,000
They will laugh at you. Leave it at this stage.

573
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,000
Has she left?

574
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,000
Yes, she has. - She is mad.

575
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,560
Come fast. Let's escape.

576
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:43,080
I thought, she will give me company for roaming around

577
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,520
but she says, she loves me.

578
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,560
In that case, I'll have to love every girl in this city.

579
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,840
Brother, do you know a boy named Salim who studies in first year?

580
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:55,880
No, sir, I don't know.

581
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:10,240
Salim, if anybody asks for me, tell them, I am in the bathroom.

582
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,840
It must be my dad.

583
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,400
Sir..

584
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,240
I am Ashok's friend, Salim speaking.

585
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,320
Ashok is in the bathroom, sir.

586
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,200
His cell phone must have got switched off due to lack of charge.

587
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:24,960
Okay, sir.

588
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,040
Okay, I will tell him, sir. Thank you.

589
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,880
Was it dad? - Yes.

590
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,800
'I am going to Singapore, I won't have the time to come home.'

591
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,480
'Ask him to come to the airport', Right?

592
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,760
He has told that 10 times since morning.

593
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,120
He is coming tomorrow afternoon.

594
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,200
Tomorrow?

595
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,800
What about the farmhouse plan?

596
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,200
We can manage.

597
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,720
Rupa, I forgot to tell you.

598
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,360
We are going to Suresh's farmhouse tomorrow evening.

599
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,000
You are also coming. - Leave me. I am not coming.

600
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:51,120
When I reached home late after your birthday party

601
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,320
I got scolded thoroughly.

602
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,480
Now, the farmhouse? No chance!

603
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,800
Come on, Rupa. It's just for two days.

604
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,600
Are you kidding me?

605
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,240
Please, Ashok. Try to understand. Please!

606
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:04,360
Please!

607
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,280
Okay, it is time. I'm getting a call from home.

608
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,080
Are you sure, you are not coming to the farmhouse?

609
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:16,600
No.

610
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,360
Okay, Salim. Bye.

611
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,040
Bye. - Bye, Suresh. See you. - Bye.

612
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,400
Salim, wash this too.

613
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,960
Hey, if Rupa is not coming

614
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:36,480
shall we take Roseline and Meera?

615
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,680
Salim? - Forget about him.

616
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:45,680
Salim, we are going to Pondicherry this weekend. Are you coming?

617
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:49,080
No, Ashok, I have some work. You all go.

618
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,200
Salim..

619
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:58,680
Somebody has come to see you.

620
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,840
Salim's father. - Please come inside.

621
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,480
Salim, are you fine?

622
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,440
Salim, you look petrified!

623
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,000
Are you shocked? - No, dad.

624
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,640
I just did not expect you now.

625
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,080
So.. Sorry, Ashok.

626
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,240
I wasn't informed of his arrival either.

627
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:21,400
So what? Please sit down.

628
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:22,720
I am Ashok. - Hi!

629
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,200
This is Suresh. - Hi!

630
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,320
I am Salim's dad.

631
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,600
Ashok, I will go out with dad for some time.

632
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,520
Wait here. I will change and come.

633
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:35,560
All original teakwood?

634
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:37,040
Yeah.

635
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,440
Suresh, does this AC work? - Yes.

636
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:52,560
Let's go.

637
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:55,720
I will be back soon.

638
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,680
Suresh, next time, we will talk over dinner.

639
00:45:58,960 --> 00:45:59,880
Bye, Suresh.

640
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,200
Bye, Ashok. - Bye.

641
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,720
See you, bye!

642
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:06,560
Looks like a complicated family!

643
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:08,360
He's coming from so far.

644
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,520
Would he come without even informing?

645
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,160
Why did you come now?

646
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,400
Why are you asking like this, Salim?

647
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,840
Even though it is an act, it will be set right only when I show up.

648
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:24,880
Come on, you don't know anything.

649
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,080
I will hack you to death.

650
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:31,160
What do you want?

651
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:35,720
Not much. Just give me Rs.5000.

652
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:38,200
I will never approach you hereafter.

653
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:44,960
Are you not drinking?

654
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:48,800
I don't have money.

655
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,360
Drink fast and leave.

656
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,040
I should not see you here again.

657
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,560
How can you say that?

658
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,280
If you don't have the money, arrange it from somewhere else.

659
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,720
In that big house, you.. - In college..

660
00:46:58,360 --> 00:46:59,920
You show that heroism here.

661
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,480
Did you think, by pointing the screwdriver at my stomach

662
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:02,800
you have become a great person?

663
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,400
Why are you staring?

664
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:06,120
Just because I went away silently as it was college premises

665
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,400
you thought, I got scared?

666
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,200
You raise your hand at me!

667
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,360
I won't do it anymore, Salim. Please..

668
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,360
Don't stab me. Both of us study in the same college.

669
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:19,720
Please, Salim. Please.

670
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,600
Salim, please. Salim, please.

671
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,760
Henceforth, I will not do this, Salim.

672
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:30,760
Let's run away. - What has he done to me?

673
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:46,280
Salim, dad will question us like a police officer.

674
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,160
Manage him somehow. - Okay, Ashok.

675
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,280
Hi! - Hi, dad! Mom, how are you?

676
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,680
I am fine. How are you?

677
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,200
I am fine, mom.

678
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:54,400
Dad, this is Salim.

679
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:55,880
Hello, sir. - Hello. - How are you? - Fine.

680
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:58,640
Hello. - Hello. How is the college?

681
00:47:58,880 --> 00:47:59,840
It is nice, mom.

682
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,480
College will be nice. Ask him, how his studies are going on?

683
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:04,440
It's going on smoothly, dad. Shall we go?

684
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,000
Give it to me, sir. I will carry it. - Give me the bag, mom.

685
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:07,360
Thank you, Salim. - You have become so thin!

686
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:09,080
I've always been like this, mom. - Okay.

687
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,560
How is this boy, Salim?

688
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:11,640
He is a very good boy.

689
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,680
Okay. Don't allow anybody else to stay in the house. Okay?

690
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,120
Do you even study or just roam around?

691
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:18,760
Nothing like that, sir. We do study.

692
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,960
We provide everything so that our children don't suffer.

693
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:23,360
If you study, good for you.

694
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:24,880
After your sister delivers the baby, on my way back

695
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,560
I will stay with you for a week.

696
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:28,040
Okay, mom. - How does your father make a living?

697
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,360
He owns a medical shop.

698
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:30,640
Good.

699
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:34,160
What? Are you done with your conversation? - What do you mean?

700
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,960
I told him that we will come a day early and stay with him.

701
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,520
He nodded his head, but now

702
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:41,240
we are in a hurry to leave.

703
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:42,600
Okay, don't start again.

704
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,080
We will see while returning.

705
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,840
There is still 1 hour left before the flight arrives.

706
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:47,960
Let's eat something.

707
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:50,960
Ashok has to go urgently. He has some important work.

708
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:52,920
Salim will be here. Only I have to go.

709
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:55,600
Why are you troubling that boy? We will manage, Ashok.

710
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,240
No problem, ma'am. I will be here.

711
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:59,280
Ashok, do you want some money? - I have it, dad.

712
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:02,080
Convey my regards to Lakshmi and her husband.

713
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:03,840
I will take leave. - Okay, go carefully.

714
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:05,720
Bye, mom. Bye, dad. - Take care of your health. - Okay.

715
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:06,760
Take care.

716
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,360
Come, let's talk as we have something. - Okay, sir.

717
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,360
Come.

718
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:17,800
Have you come, Salim?

719
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,160
What did dad say? - He said, he will call you

720
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,240
after reaching Singapore.

721
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:21,800
Did he ask, why I am leaving early?

722
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,040
No.

723
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,040
Thanks, Salim. - Ashok..

724
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,400
I am ready. Shall we go?

725
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:27,600
Bye, Salim. - Bye.

726
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:29,200
I will come tomorrow evening. - See you tomorrow.

727
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:33,600
Get in.

728
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:36,040
Don't worry if there is no space. You can sit on my lap.

729
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,160
It is hot. Be careful.

730
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,120
Thank you.

731
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,280
Why didn't he take you along?

732
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:58,840
I have to meet my professor tomorrow.

733
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,080
That is why, I told him that I will not come.

734
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:03,800
Ashok didn't tell me anything about going there with girls.

735
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,640
Ashok didn't know that Suresh would be coming there with girls.

736
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:09,600
In fact, when you refused to go, Ashok did not want to go with him.

737
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:11,840
Suresh compelled and took him along.

738
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:16,080
I've no problems with him going out with girls.

739
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,480
But why did he have to hide it from me?

740
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,920
He has switched off his phone too.

741
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,280
I have never hidden anything from Ashok.

742
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,000
Even he should do the same.

743
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:27,560
But, he does not understand that

744
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,360
and takes everything lightly.

745
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:31,440
Even this morning, Ashok was talking about you.

746
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:33,760
In short

747
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:35,280
he does not have a life without you.

748
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,520
Everything is fine, Salim

749
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,320
but I'm unable to take this matter so lightly.

750
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,680
Certain things that I feel are wrong

751
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,080
he doesn't feel that they're wrong.

752
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:48,120
This quality of Ashok disturbs me.

753
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:50,360
Rupa, I can understand you.

754
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:51,880
You love Ashok deeply.

755
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,440
You are always thinking about him.

756
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:56,080
That is why, such things disturb you a lot.

757
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:57,720
Possessiveness is bound to be there in love

758
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:59,800
but it will become a problem if it becomes intense.

759
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,680
You get angry even when his phone is switched off.

760
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:06,080
Ashok may commit small mistakes.

761
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:08,560
Don't magnify it.

762
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,640
Nobody is 100 percent perfect here.

763
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:12,360
Your coffee will go cold. Have it.

764
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:24,200
'Currently switched off.'

765
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,960
'The number you have called is currently switched off.'

766
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:28,480
'Please call again.'

767
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:39,240
I will be back, Rupa.

768
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:00,440
'Hi, Rupa.'

769
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:02,320
'It is a mistake that I came here without informing you.'

770
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:03,880
'I am really sorry.'

771
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,920
'Henceforth, I will not do anything against your wish.'

772
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:09,120
'I'll see you tomorrow. Bye.'

773
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:13,960
You can smile a bit.

774
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,080
Thank you.

775
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:28,160
You perform mimicry?

776
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:30,960
It started as a game for me during my childhood.

777
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:33,680
I did not know how to console you. That is why.

778
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:37,000
After talking to you, I feel so relieved.

779
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:42,400
Ashok need not know whatever I spoke to you about him.

780
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:44,040
Sure.

781
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:56,200
I will withdraw the money and then, we can leave.

782
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:04,480
Hey, Karthik, are you fine?

783
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:09,440
Karthik?

784
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,520
My name is Salim. You've mistaken me

785
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:13,640
for someone else.

786
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,640
Are you Salim? What are you saying?

787
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,320
Don't you recognize me? - No, I don't.

788
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:19,280
You hail from Ramanathapuram, right?

789
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:20,600
What's wrong, Salim?

790
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:22,440
Yes. - Which school?

791
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:23,880
The Islam Higher Secondary School.

792
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,800
I have seen you in Ramanathapuram secondary school.

793
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:29,200
How can I go wrong? You are committing a crime, Karthik.

794
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:32,160
Sir, what crime have I committed?

795
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:33,600
You came on your own.

796
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:34,920
You said, I am Karthik.

797
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:36,200
Now, you say that I'm committing a crime.

798
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:37,680
Please leave, without torturing me any further.

799
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:39,160
Sir, take him along.

800
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:40,840
Ashok, we are getting late for college.

801
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:42,200
You are Karthik!

802
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:44,480
Salim, leave him.

803
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:47,000
If you speak again.. - Salim, leave him.

804
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:48,360
I will not even give respect to your age.

805
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:50,160
Salim, let's go.

806
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,080
Take him. - Go, Salim. - Come on.

807
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,840
I know it very well that he is Karthik.

808
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:56,760
Karthik, you can deceive me. But it is not for your good.

809
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:59,240
Father, you've retired. Why do you bother about others?

810
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:00,280
Keep quiet and come.

811
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,840
No. Why should he say, he is Salim and cheat others?

812
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,480
Let him do whatever he wants. Why should we bother?

813
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,040
Come without creating a problem. It is getting late.

814
00:54:58,320 --> 00:54:59,240
Hundred years, Salim!

815
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:01,000
Ashok.

816
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,600
I was expecting you.

817
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,000
Will you believe if he says so?

818
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:07,200
Ashok, please.

819
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:09,480
That day

820
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,160
it was just you, me, and Suresh, who had gone to the farmhouse, right?

821
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,080
Rupa is not believing me. You tell her.

822
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,400
Ashok, I believe you.

823
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,800
You three had gone to the farmhouse. Okay?

824
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:20,880
Leave it.

825
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:23,720
Was it a mistake that I questioned you?

826
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,920
Sorry, Salim. We were just talking. Nothing else.

827
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:29,280
Nothing!

828
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:31,640
A while ago, you were asking questions

829
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,400
as if you knew everything. What happened now?

830
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:35,240
You did not believe me

831
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:37,040
but if he tells, you will believe. - Please stop it, Ashok.

832
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:38,240
Shall I tell the truth?

833
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:39,720
When you and Suresh had gone to the farmhouse

834
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:42,160
I called you both. Your mobiles were switched off.

835
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:44,880
After that, I came here and spoke to Salim.

836
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:49,640
So, tell lies, it is not wrong.

837
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,480
But for that purpose, don't make a fool out of others.

838
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:53,960
At least, try to be true to yourself.

839
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:00,960
Sorry, Salim.

840
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:06,520
Sorry, Ashok.

841
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:09,000
I don't have any intention to hurt you.

842
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:11,960
If what I did was wrong, was what you did right?

843
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:14,720
You asked him about what I was doing, behind my back

844
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:17,440
and then, both of you hid it from me. What do you call that?

845
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:19,800
Ashok. Don't you know about Rupa?

846
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:21,160
It is all his doing.

847
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:22,680
You are shouting at her instead of shouting at him.

848
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:23,800
Will you keep quiet?

849
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:26,640
Ashok, I did not say anything about you.. - Shut up!

850
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:28,960
Ashok! What is wrong with you?

851
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,280
Why did you slap him?

852
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:32,640
You both were wrong.

853
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:34,680
Why do you find fault with others to hide it?

854
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,080
Sorry, Salim. All this happened because of me.

855
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:41,680
I am really very sorry.

856
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:56,160
This will not work out. Find yourself another place.

857
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:58,080
Next time, if you tell anything about me to Rupa

858
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:00,760
or to any other girl, that's all.

859
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,680
Ashok, I did not tell anything about you to Rupa.

860
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:03,880
Why didn't you tell me that she had come here?

861
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:06,400
You're surviving on my favors

862
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,360
and you misled my girlfriend..

863
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,720
Now, are you putting up an act of being a noble person?

864
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:13,120
Are you not ashamed?

865
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:20,080
Why are you giving him time?

866
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:22,000
I had warned you earlier itself

867
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:23,440
that he is not a good person and not to let him stay with you.

868
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:25,080
But you defended him.

869
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,120
Did you see what happened?

870
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:27,440
Will you shut up?

871
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:29,440
You are responsible for all this.

872
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:32,000
Okay, buddy. You are angry now.

873
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:33,080
I will come and see you later.

874
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:21,520
'It's gonna be here, can't throw too far away.'

875
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:26,680
'Oh, look! He's going to try the summersault in it too.'

876
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:29,400
'Not good enough. Oh, no!'

877
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:34,000
'He got it!'

878
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:37,960
'And standing!'

879
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:40,160
Ashok.

880
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:42,320
Professor asked about you.

881
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:44,160
He asked me to tell you that if you don't have full attendance

882
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,480
you cannot write the examination.

883
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:49,920
Then..

884
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,120
'He's gone at the right.'

885
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:53,200
'He's gonna go way up and toss it up!'

886
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:54,600
I have found another place to stay.

887
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:56,600
Tomorrow, I am vacating from here.

888
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:59,000
'He gets him, all I can say is that he's just brilliant!'

889
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:03,040
'Wow! It is the second last dive of the summer, takes the breather.'

890
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:06,200
'That's not just brilliant, that's extraordinary. - He is a genius.'

891
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:08,440
'Never seen anything like that in my life.'

892
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:11,000
'Oh, my! Just see the smile on his face.'

893
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:13,760
'Haven't seen anything like this either. He's gone..'

894
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:58,960
What are you doing, Ashok?

895
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:01,480
What are you doing here, Ashok?

896
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:02,840
The person in this photo is you, right?

897
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:05,480
Who are these people with you?

898
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:06,840
Ashok, give it to me.

899
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:09,280
No, I will not. Answer my question.

900
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:11,000
Ashok, please. Give it to me.

901
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:13,280
Who was that who had come in search of you the other day?

902
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:15,040
Ashok, that's none of your business. Give that photo, Ashok.

903
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:16,120
You told, you've completed B.Sc., right?

904
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:17,760
Show me those certificates, I will believe you.

905
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:19,520
Why bring it up now? I have seen another house.

906
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:21,240
Give that photograph. I will leave right away.

907
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:23,040
The way you're asking for it, I can make out that you're a wrong person.

908
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,080
Yesterday, you fought with a person in front of the ATM..

909
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,280
He was right. Your name is Karthik.

910
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:28,840
You are cheating everyone here by saying that you are Salim.

911
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:32,320
Am I right? - I don't need to prove to you that I am Salim.

912
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:33,880
Ashok, give me that photo.

913
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:34,920
Why?

914
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:36,880
You are committing a big crime. When you get caught

915
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,240
even I will get caught for letting you stay here.

916
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:40,120
I am telling you. I'll be leaving right away.

917
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:41,200
I will not come to you ever again.

918
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:42,360
I cannot leave you like that.

919
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:43,600
Answer my question straightforwardly.

920
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:45,840
I won't. What will you do?

921
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:50,200
You won't tell me. I'll see what you say, when the police questions you.

922
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:52,080
Ashok, listen.. - Will you raise your hand at me?

923
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:53,400
Hit me! Let me see how you hit me!

924
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:55,640
Sorry, Ashok. Sorry, Ashok.

925
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:58,360
Sorry, Ashok. Sorry, Ashok. I did not intend to hit you.

926
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:00,120
Forgive me, Ashok. - You fraud!

927
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:04,680
You cheat! You're cheating everybody, you fraud!

928
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:06,320
Are you cheating everybody?

929
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:53,880
Ashok.. Ashok..

930
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:56,440
Ashok..

931
01:03:57,680 --> 01:03:58,640
Ashok..

932
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:15,880
Ashok..

933
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:20,160
Ashok.. Ashok..

934
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:24,320
Ashok.. Ashok..

935
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:26,840
Ashok.. Ashok..

936
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:29,480
Ashok.. Ashok!

937
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:31,760
Ashok..

938
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:32,920
Ashok, get up.

939
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:34,800
Hey, Ashok..

940
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:38,240
Ashok! Get up. Get up!

941
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:41,120
Did I hit you? Ashok, you were the one who hit me.

942
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:44,360
Get up, Ashok. Get up. Get up.

943
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:50,320
Ashok..

944
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:17,560
Get up.

945
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:34,880
Did I kill you?

946
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:37,760
Did I kill you?

947
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:40,600
Did I kill you?

948
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:43,800
Jackie, come here.

949
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:47,040
What happened? Why is he barking?

950
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:49,960
I don't know. He is barking, looking at the neighbor's house.

951
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:51,480
Those boys must have done something.

952
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:52,880
Jackie, go inside.

953
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:49,720
Hello, Ashok.

954
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:52,360
Can you hear me? - Yes, dad.

955
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:55,240
What happened to your voice? Do you have a cold? - Yes.

956
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:56,560
Take tablets.

957
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:58,240
By the way, the doctor has given

958
01:08:58,360 --> 01:09:00,760
the 6th of next month, as the delivery date for Lakshmi.

959
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:02,680
How is mom? - She is fine.

960
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:03,760
Wait, talk to her.

961
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:05,480
Ashok, are you okay?

962
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:09,000
We got Lakshmi's scan done. The baby is healthy.

963
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:12,240
There's no problem. The doctor has told that she will have a normal delivery.

964
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:13,920
Okay, mom. How are you?

965
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:16,920
We are fine. We felt like talking to you.

966
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:18,720
Hence, called you up. Nothing else.

967
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:21,720
Eat on time. Take care of your health. Okay?

968
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:23,680
Shall I hang up? - Okay, mom.

969
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:02,680
Hi. - Hi.

970
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:05,280
What happened? You have come at this hour.

971
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:06,880
Come inside.

972
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:23,680
I haven't spoken to Ashok since the last two days.

973
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:26,160
I am finding it really hard, Salim.

974
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:28,920
I wanted to see him. So..

975
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:33,320
Even I am at fault.

976
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:35,800
In your presence

977
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:37,880
I should not have spoken to Ashok in that manner.

978
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:40,880
Even you had told me.

979
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:44,760
I gave it a thought.

980
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:47,600
Instead of waiting for him to come and talk to me

981
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:50,880
I felt, I should break this silence myself. I came immediately.

982
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:54,920
Even today, we were talking about you.

983
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:57,520
He is still angry with you.

984
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:00,680
I don't think, this is the right time to talk.

985
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:02,200
Think about it.

986
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:05,200
He would have forgotten about the fight that day itself.

987
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:06,320
He must be angry now

988
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:09,040
because I didn't call him for two days.

989
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:11,080
We've never been without seeing or talking to each other before.

990
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:13,240
More than me, he must have found it hard.

991
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:16,960
He never questioned me, irrespective of whatever I did.

992
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:19,240
Only I..

993
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:24,080
He must be upstairs, right? He's lying down after

994
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:26,240
complaining of a headache. I was going to get tablets for him.

995
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:27,720
Why don't you come and see him in the morning?

996
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:30,720
Salim, I won't be able to stay

997
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:33,680
without seeing him or talking to him any longer.

998
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:35,120
Please, I'll see him and leave.

999
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:37,080
You go and come back soon.

1000
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:40,600
I will be back in 10 minutes. Lock the door. - Okay.

1001
01:15:57,960 --> 01:15:58,920
Ashok.

1002
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:15,840
Ashok! Please open the door.

1003
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:18,840
What I did was wrong.

1004
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:22,880
I am sorry, if I've spoken out of turn.

1005
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:24,200
I spoke to you in that manner

1006
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:26,560
out of my possessiveness for you.

1007
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:29,960
I did not doubt you. Definitely not.

1008
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:34,600
Please, Ashok. Open the door.

1009
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:36,080
Please!

1010
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:40,520
Tell me. What should I do to subside your anger?

1011
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:45,720
You are hurting me a lot, Ashok.

1012
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:04,640
I know, I haven't done anything wrong.

1013
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:07,880
Still, if I have come at this hour and am requesting you

1014
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:10,720
it is because I love you so much, Ashok.

1015
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:14,280
Why don't you understand that?

1016
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:22,440
I am leaving now, not out of anger

1017
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:25,360
but out of fear that again

1018
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:28,600
I might say something which may hurt you.

1019
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:38,120
Salim, come here.

1020
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:41,760
Yes, sir.

1021
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:44,000
Go to the college office and see Mr. Sundaram.

1022
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:46,480
I have recommended a scholarship for you.

1023
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:48,160
You just study well.

1024
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:49,280
I will take care of the other things.

1025
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:50,520
Thank you, sir.

1026
01:22:14,120 --> 01:22:15,800
Hello. - Hi, Salim, how are you?

1027
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:17,480
Fine, sir. - Is Ashok there?

1028
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:19,240
Ashok is inside. I will call him, sir.

1029
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:25,960
Yes, dad.

1030
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:28,040
Hey, dad.

1031
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:30,640
Hi, dad.

1032
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:37,160
Yes, dad. - My friend, Mohandas has come from Dubai.

1033
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:38,480
You go and meet him.

1034
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:41,080
Dad, I have to study.

1035
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:43,160
Come on, Ashok! This is also important.

1036
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:45,640
He will give you a file. Keep it with you.

1037
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:47,480
I will collect it when I come to Chennai.

1038
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:50,000
Has he seen me? - He had seen you as a child.

1039
01:22:50,120 --> 01:22:51,120
He may not remember you now.

1040
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:54,160
Meet him at a decent hour. He has come with his family.

1041
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:56,520
Okay, dad. When should I go?

1042
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:57,800
I have given him your cell number.

1043
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:59,680
Keep your phone switched on. He will call you.

1044
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:01,200
How are Lakshmi and mom?

1045
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:03,600
All are fine. You take care of your health.

1046
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:05,400
I will call you at night. Okay?

1047
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:07,080
Bye, dad. - Bye, Ashok.

1048
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:53,720
"Open the door, I want to show you something."

1049
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:57,400
"You gotta call me. My name is Salim."

1050
01:23:59,320 --> 01:24:00,960
"Every day that I keep hunting."

1051
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:04,520
"Let me go on, let me go strong."

1052
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:36,400
Hi! - Hi.

1053
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:38,360
Ashok has grown up, hasn't he?

1054
01:25:39,240 --> 01:25:40,200
Yeah.

1055
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:46,960
Hi, Ashok. Though I am seeing you after a long time

1056
01:25:47,080 --> 01:25:49,520
I could recognize you at once because of your eyes.

1057
01:25:49,640 --> 01:25:50,960
How are you? - I am fine, Mr. Mohandas.

1058
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:52,520
How are you all?

1059
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:53,840
This is my daughter, Priya.

1060
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:56,120
Hi! - Hi.

1061
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:00,320
What will you have?

1062
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:03,640
Priya has joined here in SAM.

1063
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:04,800
Is it so?

1064
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:06,240
Computer engineering.

1065
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:32,560
Answer the call.

1066
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:35,560
It's dad calling. He wanted to speak to you.

1067
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:39,640
Hello, Mohandas speaking. How are you?

1068
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:41,320
Yeah, no problem.

1069
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:43,680
I will give the file to Ashok before going. Is that all?

1070
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:53,520
Okay. Okay. That is not a problem.

1071
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:56,040
No, no, no, we will tackle.

1072
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:00,440
Mom, one minute.

1073
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:02,080
My college friends are here.

1074
01:27:02,280 --> 01:27:03,360
I'll be right back. - Okay.

1075
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:04,960
One minute, I will just be back.

1076
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:14,360
Why don't you ask him to sign?

1077
01:27:16,160 --> 01:27:19,200
Okay. Agreed. Then, let's do this.

1078
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:23,520
When you come here, we will meet and discuss.

1079
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:27,160
Don't worry about it. Oh..

1080
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:29,080
Excuse me, ma'am. I want to use the restroom.

1081
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:30,560
Yeah. - I will do something about it.

1082
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:53,200
Hello, ma'am. - Hello. - Hello, sir. - Hello.

1083
01:27:53,320 --> 01:27:55,400
How are you? - Sit down. - Fine. Take a seat.

1084
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:09,720
Where is Ashok? - He has gone to the restroom.

1085
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:25,200
Okay, Priya, I'll see you later. - See you.

1086
01:28:25,320 --> 01:28:26,200
Okay. - Bye, ma'am. - Take care. - Bye, sir.

1087
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:27,320
Okay. - Bye.

1088
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:06,880
Hi, Rupa. What are you doing here?

1089
01:29:07,240 --> 01:29:08,360
You're here?

1090
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:10,240
Did Ashok call you and ask you to come too?

1091
01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:12,440
No, I'm here with my friends.

1092
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:15,200
I came to know that Ashok has come here only after coming here.

1093
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:18,200
Where is Ashok? - He has gone to smoke.

1094
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:20,760
How does Ashok know Priya's family?

1095
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:22,360
Has he told you anything about it?

1096
01:29:23,160 --> 01:29:25,040
A friend of Ashok's father has come from Dubai.

1097
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:26,400
He has come to meet him.

1098
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:28,440
If you take a right there and then, a left

1099
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:29,480
you'll find the smoking area.

1100
01:29:29,640 --> 01:29:30,600
He must have gone there.

1101
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:35,200
Don't worry, Rupa. Everything will fall in place like before.

1102
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:37,920
I am also speaking to him. Give it some time.

1103
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:40,720
Okay, Salim. Thank you. - No problem.

1104
01:29:40,840 --> 01:29:42,280
See you later. - Okay, Rupa.

1105
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:43,400
Bye. - Bye.

1106
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:02,880
You have got two calls, Ashok.

1107
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:06,200
First, place the order and then, talk.

1108
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:13,640
Is it an important call?

1109
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,560
Sir, I had forgotten that I'd called a senior home

1110
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:17,000
to clarify some doubts.

1111
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:19,880
He is waiting outside the house. Sorry, sir, I am leaving.

1112
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:22,400
We will be here for another two days.

1113
01:30:22,720 --> 01:30:24,720
I have told your dad that I'll give him some details.

1114
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:26,680
Will you come and collect it later? - Okay, sir.

1115
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:28,680
At least drink soup before leaving. - No, sir.

1116
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:30,280
Next time, I will definitely dine with you.

1117
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:32,840
I'll give a call before coming to collect the papers. Bye, ma'am.

1118
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:34,320
Bye, Ashok. - Bye, Priya. - Bye.

1119
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:39,880
'The Airtel number you are trying to reach'

1120
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,080
'is currently busy.'

1121
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:50,600
Buddy, where are you?

1122
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:52,080
I have come to meet my father's friend.

1123
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:54,400
Just now, I saw your number. What is the matter?

1124
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:57,680
I got to know. Rupa told me everything. I was just talking to her.

1125
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:59,400
You know it, right? Then, why are you asking?

1126
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:01,880
Okay, leave it. I am waiting outside your house.

1127
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:04,800
When will you come? - It will take time. I will see you tomorrow.

1128
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:06,680
Henceforth, give me a call before coming.

1129
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:08,520
Tell me how long will it take. I will wait.

1130
01:32:08,680 --> 01:32:10,920
It will take two to three hours. Why? What is the matter?

1131
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:12,920
Dude, I have brought a good brand.

1132
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:14,800
Just make some excuse and come.

1133
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:17,120
On your way, pick something up to eat along with it.

1134
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:18,600
I can come only after dropping them at the hotel.

1135
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:21,360
I will be late. Let's meet up tomorrow.

1136
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:23,360
Now, leave the place without pestering me any further.

1137
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:24,640
What's wrong with you?

1138
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:26,320
I've been observing

1139
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:28,240
that you have been behaving differently since the last few days.

1140
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:30,600
You have also fought with Rupa. She is very upset.

1141
01:32:31,200 --> 01:32:32,480
I have called you so many times.

1142
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:34,160
Every time, I get the response that your phone's switched off.

1143
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:35,960
Even when you talk, you make excuses and give

1144
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:38,160
some or the other reasons. What is your problem?

1145
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:40,280
Have we not met late in the night before?

1146
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:41,440
You are talking differently.

1147
01:32:41,680 --> 01:32:43,680
We are meeting today, irrespective of whenever you come.

1148
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,280
Why don't you understand?

1149
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:47,880
Okay. Let's do this.

1150
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,080
Tomorrow at 7:30 p.m.

1151
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:50,560
Come alone. Let's meet at the pub.

1152
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:53,240
Remember, come alone. Rupa should not come.

1153
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:54,720
Don't you think, this is too much?

1154
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:56,080
Why are you saying, Rupa shouldn't come?

1155
01:32:56,640 --> 01:32:58,440
Listen to me. If I tell you not to bring her, don't.

1156
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:02,880
Come alone. Instead, if you bring her, I will go away. Bye.

1157
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:04,640
Hey, Ashok! Why are you getting angry?

1158
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:31,120
Come in. - Good afternoon, sir.

1159
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:32,600
Sit down.

1160
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:35,760
Is there any problem with your friend, Ashok?

1161
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:39,040
No, sir. - A complaint has gone from the college to his parents.

1162
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:42,480
No reply. Do you know his dad's cell number or email id?

1163
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:44,200
I don't know, sir. - Why is he wasting

1164
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:45,240
his medical seat like this?

1165
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:46,520
If he is not interested, why is he studying?

1166
01:33:46,640 --> 01:33:47,760
Let him take a TC and leave.

1167
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:51,520
He should not attend class without seeing me.

1168
01:33:52,440 --> 01:33:53,960
Inform him. - Okay, sir.

1169
01:34:18,720 --> 01:34:20,920
Are you searching for Ashok? - Yes.

1170
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:23,600
I told you, he is angry with you and has asked you not to meet him.

1171
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,000
Why did you come here then?

1172
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:26,520
What? Are you guys playing a prank on me?

1173
01:34:26,640 --> 01:34:28,400
Salim called me up and asked me to come here

1174
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:30,440
whereas you are asking me, why I have come.

1175
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:33,240
What's my mistake, for Ashok to get so angry at me?

1176
01:34:33,360 --> 01:34:34,440
Did Salim ask you to come here?

1177
01:34:34,720 --> 01:34:36,200
Why are you listening to that idiot?

1178
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:38,240
I had said earlier itself, not to let him inside the house.

1179
01:34:38,640 --> 01:34:40,760
Ashok did not heed to my words. - What has he done?

1180
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:43,200
He asked me to come here to solve our problem.

1181
01:34:43,680 --> 01:34:44,960
He's not at fault.

1182
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:46,720
Yes, we are the ones at fault.

1183
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:49,240
Why is Ashok avoiding me if he isn't at fault?

1184
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:51,680
He will be here. Ask him yourself.

1185
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:28,680
It's him calling.

1186
01:35:29,680 --> 01:35:32,280
Why has Rupa come here? - I did not ask her to come.

1187
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:33,360
You did not listen, in spite of my telling you several times.

1188
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:34,680
That fool, Salim has asked her to come.

1189
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:37,600
Okay, I am leaving. - Hello.. Hello!

1190
01:35:38,160 --> 01:35:39,120
Ashok!

1191
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:41,120
What happened, Suresh?

1192
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:44,800
'The number you have called is currently switched off.'

1193
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:50,680
What's the matter? What happened, Suresh?

1194
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:58,520
Hi! - Hi.

1195
01:35:58,640 --> 01:36:00,360
Rupa! What a surprise!

1196
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:03,840
Who is he? Your boyfriend?

1197
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,880
Not at all, just a friend.

1198
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:09,960
Have you come alone?

1199
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:12,960
No, a family friend has told me, he'll meet me here.

1200
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:18,160
The other day, he was there at the restaurant with me, Mr. Ashok..

1201
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:21,840
Oh! Sorry, you did not meet him that day, right?

1202
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:23,680
Oh, yeah.

1203
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:27,680
"Because of you, I'm flying high."

1204
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:30,480
Okay, bye. See you later.

1205
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:32,480
Catch you later. - Thanks.

1206
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:34,240
"You wanna want it.."

1207
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:36,600
Okay, Rupa, I am leaving. Ashok has come and gone.

1208
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:39,360
I have understood everything, Suresh.

1209
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:47,520
Ashok had come to the hotel the other day to meet her family.

1210
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:50,600
Even now, he has only asked her to come here.

1211
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:55,000
That is why, the moment he saw me here

1212
01:36:55,120 --> 01:36:56,520
he ran away as he could not face me.

1213
01:36:56,640 --> 01:36:57,840
Is that why, he is avoiding you every time?

1214
01:36:58,400 --> 01:36:59,840
I know how to catch hold of him.

1215
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:03,960
You leave, Rupa. It is a waste, waiting here. He will not come.

1216
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:11,160
She is waiting. Shall we also wait for some time?

1217
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:13,160
We will be waiting unnecessarily. He will not come.

1218
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:14,920
Come, let's go.

1219
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:23,240
Bye.

1220
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:47,240
Hi. - Hi.

1221
01:38:48,080 --> 01:38:50,760
Surprise. How do you know my address?

1222
01:38:51,440 --> 01:38:53,480
Did you forget, Ashok? This was our house.

1223
01:38:54,240 --> 01:38:55,840
We sold it to uncle before leaving for Dubai.

1224
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,960
Is it so? I don't know. Come in.

1225
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:04,920
Dad has asked you to hand over this file to your dad.

1226
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:13,040
Do you know, I waited in the pub for such a long time that day?

1227
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:14,960
Did you forget that you had asked me to come there?

1228
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:17,120
Even your phone was switched off.

1229
01:39:17,440 --> 01:39:19,760
Sorry, Priya. Suddenly, I'd to attend to some urgent work.

1230
01:39:20,480 --> 01:39:22,920
I got held up. Also, my phone had no charge.

1231
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:24,160
Oh! - That is why..

1232
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:28,080
If you are free now, shall we go out somewhere?

1233
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:30,200
Dinner?

1234
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:31,760
Sure.

1235
01:39:32,720 --> 01:39:34,600
Your eyes are watery. Has dust got into your eyes?

1236
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:36,800
It is nothing. It is slightly irritating.

1237
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:39,560
Wait, I will help you. - It is okay. Thanks.

1238
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:41,880
Wait for some time. I will change and come.

1239
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:21,800
Hi, is Ashok there?

1240
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:25,400
You? - Suresh, Ashok's friend.

1241
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:27,720
The other day, we had met in the pub.

1242
01:40:28,480 --> 01:40:29,920
Yes, come in.

1243
01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:36,720
Sorry, I asked without knowing that you are Ashok's friend.

1244
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:40,960
I am Priya. - No problem. Where is Ashok?

1245
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:43,640
He is changing his dress.

1246
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:50,120
Ashok, are you ready? - Yes, Priya. Two minutes.

1247
01:40:51,440 --> 01:40:53,600
Sorry, I forgot. What did you say your name was?

1248
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:56,680
Suresh. Is Ashok in that room? - Yes.

1249
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:00,520
Actually, Rupa is my college mate.

1250
01:41:01,680 --> 01:41:04,280
She had come with you to the pub that day, right?

1251
01:41:04,400 --> 01:41:06,520
Rupa, my classmate. - Yes, Rupa told me.

1252
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:22,280
Hi, Ashok.

1253
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:28,680
Hey!

1254
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:40,480
Priya, you go for now. I will call you later.

1255
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:44,760
Why? What happened? What happened, Ashok?

1256
01:41:46,160 --> 01:41:47,880
Sorry, Priya, don't ask me anything now.

1257
01:41:48,240 --> 01:41:50,200
Suresh is your friend, isn't he? - Yes.

1258
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:53,520
Then, why are you tensed? - There's a minor problem between us.

1259
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:56,000
It has to be solved today itself. That is why, he has come.

1260
01:41:56,800 --> 01:41:59,880
I will wait upstairs. We can go after you finish talking.

1261
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:01,640
Sorry, Priya, It will take some time.

1262
01:42:02,720 --> 01:42:04,480
I will call you tomorrow. We will definitely go.

1263
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:08,760
Bye, Priya. - Bye.

1264
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:11,880
Okay, tomorrow for sure? - Sure.

1265
01:42:15,440 --> 01:42:16,680
Bye. - Bye.

1266
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:48,720
Who is that who's visiting you, thinking you to be Ashok?

1267
01:42:51,440 --> 01:42:55,080
I was wondering, why your looks and activities seemed so different.

1268
01:42:55,760 --> 01:42:58,840
Nothing seemed to be right. I'd a doubt, something is wrong.

1269
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:02,480
Only now, I've come to understand. Where is Ashok?

1270
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:06,760
These are Ashok's clothes, right?

1271
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:09,880
Does Ashok know about this?

1272
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:13,720
So, had she come to see you in the pub yesterday?

1273
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:24,400
Even at the restaurant, you have met Priya's family, as Ashok.

1274
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:32,920
Hey, what are you doing?

1275
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:34,440
Is he alive or have you done something to him?

1276
01:50:36,080 --> 01:50:41,040
"Every day, I am dying."

1277
01:50:42,640 --> 01:50:47,800
"Living in fear."

1278
01:50:49,120 --> 01:50:54,360
"Going through the pain."

1279
01:50:55,760 --> 01:51:00,720
"Seeing only darkness."

1280
01:51:02,480 --> 01:51:05,040
"Where do I go"

1281
01:51:05,680 --> 01:51:08,560
"to cure my illness?"

1282
01:51:09,040 --> 01:51:11,560
"I want to know the path"

1283
01:51:12,320 --> 01:51:14,800
"to that place."

1284
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:18,400
"Where do I go"

1285
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:21,440
"to get some sleep?"

1286
01:51:22,160 --> 01:51:25,000
"I want to lead a life"

1287
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:27,920
"in that place."

1288
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:33,680
"Every day, I am dying."

1289
01:51:35,360 --> 01:51:40,120
"Living in fear."

1290
01:51:41,920 --> 01:51:46,600
"Going through the pain."

1291
01:51:48,400 --> 01:51:53,320
"Seeing only darkness."

1292
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:11,840
Ashok.

1293
01:52:12,240 --> 01:52:15,000
Ashok is not here. He has gone out. What is it, sir?

1294
01:52:15,200 --> 01:52:17,680
You? - Salim, Ashok's friend.

1295
01:52:18,160 --> 01:52:19,960
Classmate. I stay here.

1296
01:52:20,560 --> 01:52:21,480
Why are you asking, sir?

1297
01:52:21,840 --> 01:52:23,080
Can we talk inside?

1298
01:52:32,080 --> 01:52:33,880
Which place do you belong to? - Ramanathapuram, sir.

1299
01:52:34,640 --> 01:52:35,960
Do you know when will Ashok come?

1300
01:52:36,080 --> 01:52:37,720
I don't know, sir.

1301
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:42,200
Sir, if you could tell me what's the problem..

1302
01:52:42,320 --> 01:52:44,040
Does Ashok have a friend named Suresh?

1303
01:52:44,160 --> 01:52:46,880
Yes, sir. - He has been murdered two days ago.

1304
01:52:50,640 --> 01:52:52,040
When did Ashok go out?

1305
01:52:53,680 --> 01:52:54,800
Salim!

1306
01:52:56,640 --> 01:53:00,080
How, sir? - He was hit on the neck and was buried.

1307
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:04,160
We came to know, only after the owner of the land informed us.

1308
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:06,560
When did Ashok go out?

1309
01:53:09,040 --> 01:53:10,920
Yesterday, I saw him before leaving for college.

1310
01:53:11,200 --> 01:53:13,040
Haven't you seen him after that? - No, sir.

1311
01:53:14,480 --> 01:53:16,840
Do you know, when Suresh came here last?

1312
01:53:18,160 --> 01:53:21,160
The day before yesterday, no.. The evening on the day before that..

1313
01:53:21,280 --> 01:53:23,520
When I was going out, Ashok told me, he was waiting for Suresh.

1314
01:53:24,640 --> 01:53:26,040
After that, when did you see Ashok?

1315
01:53:26,160 --> 01:53:27,800
I already told you, I saw him last morning.

1316
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,080
Does Ashok often stay out at night?

1317
01:53:30,320 --> 01:53:33,400
Yes, sir. If Suresh is free, both of them usually stay out.

1318
01:53:33,760 --> 01:53:35,120
What do you know about Ashok and Suresh's friendship?

1319
01:53:36,080 --> 01:53:37,080
Very close friends, sir.

1320
01:53:37,840 --> 01:53:39,840
I got to know Suresh through Ashok. But..

1321
01:53:40,080 --> 01:53:41,960
I searched the whole house, sir. There's no one.

1322
01:53:42,880 --> 01:53:44,000
You were saying something.

1323
01:53:44,320 --> 01:53:46,040
Actually, sir, since last few days

1324
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:47,840
it looked like both of them were not in good terms.

1325
01:53:48,240 --> 01:53:50,560
What do you mean? Could you elaborate?

1326
01:53:51,760 --> 01:53:53,360
I think, it had got something to do with girls.

1327
01:53:53,680 --> 01:53:56,600
I don't know who it is. Both of them didn't speak to me about it.

1328
01:53:56,800 --> 01:53:58,560
Do they both have girlfriends?

1329
01:53:58,880 --> 01:54:00,560
Ashok has a girlfriend named Rupa.

1330
01:54:01,040 --> 01:54:03,080
Suresh roams around with many girls.

1331
01:54:03,200 --> 01:54:05,240
Did they have a problem because of Rupa?

1332
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:06,840
I don't think so, sir.

1333
01:54:07,040 --> 01:54:08,280
She is a very nice girl.

1334
01:54:10,240 --> 01:54:11,920
Because of Suresh's company, Ashok used to roam around

1335
01:54:12,160 --> 01:54:14,120
with other girls without Rupa's knowledge.

1336
01:54:15,040 --> 01:54:17,160
I guess, this was the problem between them, sir.

1337
01:54:18,400 --> 01:54:19,840
Since how many days do you know Ashok?

1338
01:54:20,320 --> 01:54:22,320
I know him from 11th standard.

1339
01:54:22,640 --> 01:54:25,960
Knowing means.. Were you lovers? - Yeah.

1340
01:54:26,240 --> 01:54:30,360
Did Ashok and Suresh have a tiff recently?

1341
01:54:30,880 --> 01:54:34,080
No. Just a small misunderstanding.

1342
01:54:35,040 --> 01:54:36,840
Because of that, Ashok started avoiding

1343
01:54:36,960 --> 01:54:39,520
Suresh and me since quite some time now.

1344
01:54:39,760 --> 01:54:41,600
How is Ashok? - He will not study.

1345
01:54:41,920 --> 01:54:43,440
He will not allow the others to study as well.

1346
01:54:43,760 --> 01:54:46,520
I am glad that the other students are not spoiled because of him.

1347
01:54:46,640 --> 01:54:48,120
Has Ashok had any fight or a problem

1348
01:54:48,240 --> 01:54:49,960
with anybody else in the college?

1349
01:54:50,080 --> 01:54:51,800
It's nothing as serious as you're assuming it to be.

1350
01:54:51,920 --> 01:54:53,600
Did I make you aware of my assumptions?

1351
01:54:53,840 --> 01:54:55,960
It's nothing like that, sir. What I meant was..

1352
01:54:56,080 --> 01:54:57,640
Since Ashok teased Uma

1353
01:54:57,760 --> 01:55:00,720
I just questioned him about it but did not do any ragging.

1354
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:03,320
What is the problem between Ashok and you?

1355
01:55:03,520 --> 01:55:04,680
No problem, sir.

1356
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:06,800
What type of relationship existed between you both?

1357
01:55:08,400 --> 01:55:09,760
No relationship as such.

1358
01:55:10,320 --> 01:55:12,520
For few days, he was after me saying that he loved me.

1359
01:55:12,640 --> 01:55:14,840
Chasing girls is a time pass for him.

1360
01:55:15,360 --> 01:55:17,560
Since I knew that, I didn't accept his proposal.

1361
01:55:17,680 --> 01:55:20,280
How is Ashok's roommate, Salim? - Good friends.

1362
01:55:20,480 --> 01:55:22,280
Salim, a meritorious student.

1363
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:24,720
You can make out that as he doesn't want to trouble his parents

1364
01:55:24,960 --> 01:55:27,760
he is doing a part time job along with his studies.

1365
01:55:28,480 --> 01:55:31,160
I have seen him with Ashok. But I have not mingled with him.

1366
01:55:31,280 --> 01:55:32,360
Both of them are close friends, sir.

1367
01:55:32,640 --> 01:55:34,480
When I was enquiring Ashok about Uma

1368
01:55:34,800 --> 01:55:37,040
he was the one who came forward to hit me in Ashok's support.

1369
01:55:37,280 --> 01:55:38,840
Even then, I did not do anything.

1370
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:40,360
When did you last see Ashok?

1371
01:55:40,480 --> 01:55:41,440
It must have been around one week, sir.

1372
01:55:41,840 --> 01:55:43,520
It has been 15 days since he last attended the class.

1373
01:55:44,720 --> 01:55:46,400
I don't remember, sir.

1374
01:55:49,600 --> 01:55:50,600
What is your full name?

1375
01:55:51,200 --> 01:55:52,120
Mohammed Salim, sir.

1376
01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:54,720
Your father's name? - Mohammed Ansari, sir.

1377
01:55:54,880 --> 01:55:57,560
What does he do? - He owns a medical shop in Ramanathapuram.

1378
01:55:57,760 --> 01:55:58,920
That day, when you were going to college

1379
01:55:59,040 --> 01:56:00,280
what did Ashok tell you?

1380
01:56:00,400 --> 01:56:02,240
He said, he had to speak and solve certain things with Suresh

1381
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:03,480
and so, he is not coming to college.

1382
01:56:03,760 --> 01:56:05,600
When you returned, was Ashok there?

1383
01:56:05,920 --> 01:56:08,240
No, sir. I saw Ashok only the next day.

1384
01:56:08,720 --> 01:56:11,040
Nobody, except you, has seen Ashok for the last one week.

1385
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:13,280
You are the one to see him for the last time.

1386
01:56:13,920 --> 01:56:15,320
Sorry, sir. I forgot to tell you.

1387
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:17,800
Ashok's family friend's daughter

1388
01:56:17,920 --> 01:56:19,160
is studying here in SAM.

1389
01:56:19,280 --> 01:56:20,280
Her name is Priya.

1390
01:56:20,400 --> 01:56:22,360
Ashok was friendly with that girl for some time.

1391
01:56:22,720 --> 01:56:23,960
Rupa does not know about this.

1392
01:56:24,720 --> 01:56:26,440
She had told that she will also be coming that day.

1393
01:56:37,840 --> 01:56:38,920
Family friends...

1394
01:56:39,680 --> 01:56:40,960
I met him that day at the restaurant

1395
01:56:41,200 --> 01:56:42,880
when he had come to meet my dad.

1396
01:56:43,200 --> 01:56:44,600
When did you meet after that?

1397
01:56:45,760 --> 01:56:48,560
After that, dad asked me to hand over a file.

1398
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:53,400
I'd been to Ashok's house to give that. I met Suresh there.

1399
01:56:53,680 --> 01:56:56,680
After that, I did not see Ashok at all.

1400
01:56:58,240 --> 01:57:02,080
Sir. - What is it? Are you diabetic?

1401
01:57:02,240 --> 01:57:04,000
How many times will you go? Control and sit there.

1402
01:57:04,160 --> 01:57:06,240
Sir had asked about you. Tell me.

1403
01:57:07,120 --> 01:57:10,200
Do you know, why Ashok panicked when he saw Suresh?

1404
01:57:11,520 --> 01:57:13,080
He said, there was a minor problem between them

1405
01:57:13,200 --> 01:57:15,920
and so, Suresh had come to solve that.

1406
01:57:16,040 --> 01:57:19,200
Nowadays, minor problems make them commit big crimes.

1407
01:57:20,320 --> 01:57:21,400
What happened after that?

1408
01:57:22,720 --> 01:57:25,160
Ashok changed the dinner plan

1409
01:57:25,760 --> 01:57:27,640
and sent me out in a hurry.

1410
01:57:27,760 --> 01:57:29,080
Can you say with conviction

1411
01:57:29,200 --> 01:57:31,320
that Ashok panicked only after he saw Suresh?

1412
01:57:31,760 --> 01:57:33,120
I am absolutely sure.

1413
01:57:33,360 --> 01:57:36,960
He was the one to suggest to go out for dinner just before Suresh came.

1414
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,040
If required, you may have to come again.

1415
01:57:46,160 --> 01:57:47,600
Okay, sir. Thank you.

1416
01:58:12,720 --> 01:58:14,440
Hello, this is Satish speaking. - Which Satish?

1417
01:58:14,880 --> 01:58:18,120
Your senior, Satish. Okay, I need the address of Ashok's residence.

1418
01:58:18,240 --> 01:58:21,920
Stupid, ask him only. - Hey, I am in great tension.

1419
01:58:22,040 --> 01:58:23,880
Hello, hello..

1420
01:58:33,120 --> 01:58:34,680
Hello. - Rupa.

1421
01:58:35,840 --> 01:58:36,760
Ashok!

1422
01:58:36,880 --> 01:58:39,960
Please listen to me, Rupa. I've committed a grave mistake.

1423
01:58:40,720 --> 01:58:41,880
Ashok! - There was a misunderstanding

1424
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:43,240
between Suresh and me.

1425
01:58:44,240 --> 01:58:45,640
When we were talking about it

1426
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:48,200
we had an argument and I hit him.

1427
01:58:49,840 --> 01:58:51,400
He fell down and died.

1428
01:58:55,680 --> 01:58:59,480
Without knowing what to do, I disposed the body, out of fear

1429
01:59:04,960 --> 01:59:07,720
Ashok! What are you saying?

1430
01:59:08,480 --> 01:59:10,120
I am getting really scared.

1431
01:59:11,120 --> 01:59:12,560
Wait, I am coming home.

1432
01:59:14,880 --> 01:59:18,560
No, Rupa, I don't have the courage to face anyone.

1433
01:59:19,360 --> 01:59:22,560
I've not been true to you and to my parents.

1434
01:59:24,800 --> 01:59:27,160
Till now, I've been doing only wrong things.

1435
01:59:28,480 --> 01:59:33,320
Most importantly, I have troubled you a lot. Forgive me.

1436
01:59:33,920 --> 01:59:37,040
Ashok! - I am sorry, Rupa, forgive me.

1437
01:59:37,280 --> 01:59:38,400
Forgive me, Rupa.

1438
01:59:38,800 --> 01:59:40,160
Why are you talking like this, Ashok?

1439
01:59:41,200 --> 01:59:42,600
If you tell the truth to the police..

1440
01:59:42,720 --> 01:59:45,600
No, Rupa. That's not needed. I have decided.

1441
01:59:46,400 --> 01:59:48,960
Because of this, neither me nor the others are happy.

1442
01:59:49,200 --> 01:59:52,440
Poor Salim! They are suspecting him for my wrong doings.

1443
01:59:52,880 --> 01:59:53,840
Tell him as well.

1444
01:59:54,080 --> 01:59:57,760
Before going, I wanted to talk to you for the last time.

1445
01:59:58,880 --> 02:00:01,960
I don't have the courage to live and so, I have decided to end my life.

1446
02:00:02,080 --> 02:00:03,960
Ashok, please! Listen to me.

1447
02:00:04,080 --> 02:00:05,680
Thanks for everything, Rupa. - Ashok, please!

1448
02:00:07,360 --> 02:00:08,280
Ashok!

1449
02:00:32,080 --> 02:00:33,720
Ashok.

1450
02:00:59,680 --> 02:01:01,920
'Due to a small problem, I hit Suresh and he died.'

1451
02:01:02,400 --> 02:01:04,520
'Not knowing what to do, I buried his body.'

1452
02:01:07,040 --> 02:01:09,240
'Since the time, the police have come to know of it, I am on the run.'

1453
02:01:09,760 --> 02:01:12,000
'I am scared, I might get into trouble if someone saw me.'

1454
02:01:12,640 --> 02:01:14,880
'I am not true to my lover or to my parents.'

1455
02:01:15,760 --> 02:01:18,320
'Since I don't have the courage to live, I have decided to die.'

1456
02:01:20,640 --> 02:01:22,200
'Nobody is responsible for my death.'

1457
02:01:22,320 --> 02:01:23,840
'Please don't punish anybody for this.'

1458
02:01:24,880 --> 02:01:25,880
How did you get this?

1459
02:01:26,560 --> 02:01:27,680
I had been to the police station.

1460
02:01:28,400 --> 02:01:30,680
They suspected me and enquired. I came back just now.

1461
02:01:31,200 --> 02:01:35,200
The house was open. This letter was lying on the table.

1462
02:01:38,240 --> 02:01:41,000
Was Ashok not here when you came?

1463
02:01:41,200 --> 02:01:42,320
No.

1464
02:01:43,760 --> 02:01:44,840
I searched the whole house.

1465
02:01:45,120 --> 02:01:47,200
He is not there. Did he contact you?

1466
02:01:47,840 --> 02:01:49,000
The police thinks that I am hiding something

1467
02:01:49,120 --> 02:01:50,520
despite knowing everything about Ashok.

1468
02:01:51,040 --> 02:01:53,200
They have asked me not to leave Chennai.

1469
02:01:53,600 --> 02:01:55,640
Rupa, we have to stop him

1470
02:01:55,840 --> 02:01:57,040
before he does something as per his letter.

1471
02:01:58,720 --> 02:02:01,280
Ashok is not a foolish person to commit suicide.

1472
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:09,080
You speak like Ashok, don't you?

1473
02:02:15,920 --> 02:02:17,280
Wait, I will get the candle.

1474
02:02:53,200 --> 02:02:54,240
Rupa.

1475
02:03:01,040 --> 02:03:02,480
I told you, I am getting a candle.

1476
02:03:07,760 --> 02:03:09,080
Did you get hurt?

1477
02:03:11,200 --> 02:03:13,040
You speak like Ashok, don't you?

1478
02:03:14,240 --> 02:03:16,960
Rupa, I am not in the mood to joke now.

1479
02:03:20,160 --> 02:03:23,640
Even I am not joking, Salim. I am asking you seriously.

1480
02:03:26,800 --> 02:03:28,240
You speak like him, don't you?

1481
02:03:28,400 --> 02:03:31,640
Oh! I spoke to you that day to make you happy.

1482
02:03:32,240 --> 02:03:33,920
Are you doubting on me now, because of that?

1483
02:03:35,840 --> 02:03:38,400
Okay, I will speak like Ashok.

1484
02:03:38,800 --> 02:03:41,920
Then, who has written this letter in his handwriting?

1485
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:48,160
Rupa! Somebody is standing behind you.

1486
02:03:52,080 --> 02:03:53,280
Looks like Ashok.

1487
02:03:57,280 --> 02:03:58,560
He was here all this while.

1488
02:04:07,360 --> 02:04:08,920
You be here. I will check and be back.

1489
02:04:37,600 --> 02:04:39,280
Salim.

1490
02:05:08,480 --> 02:05:09,440
Salim!

1491
02:05:28,880 --> 02:05:31,360
Salim! Salim, open the door.

1492
02:05:31,600 --> 02:05:33,000
Rupa, I am not Salim. I am Ashok.

1493
02:05:33,600 --> 02:05:37,040
Ashok. Where's Rupa, Ashok? - Ashok.

1494
02:05:37,680 --> 02:05:39,160
I told you, I don't have the courage to face you.

1495
02:05:39,280 --> 02:05:40,240
Then, why did you come, Rupa? - Ashok!

1496
02:05:41,280 --> 02:05:42,360
Ashok, what are you doing?

1497
02:05:42,640 --> 02:05:43,680
Salim, leave me!

1498
02:05:52,800 --> 02:05:55,120
Ashok, listen to me. The police is suspecting me.

1499
02:05:55,920 --> 02:05:57,760
You say, you did not do it. Don't stop me.

1500
02:06:04,560 --> 02:06:07,000
Listen to me. Ashok!

1501
02:06:12,560 --> 02:06:14,680
Salim! Ashok!

1502
02:06:21,840 --> 02:06:22,800
Listen to me, Ashok!

1503
02:06:22,920 --> 02:06:27,080
Ashok, don't fight, please! - Think about Rupa and your parents. Listen to me, Ashok.

1504
02:06:27,200 --> 02:06:29,400
That is why, I want to die. Leave me! - Ashok!

1505
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:31,920
Salim, if you don't allow me to go, I will kill you as well.

1506
02:07:32,080 --> 02:07:33,480
Ashok!

1507
02:07:38,080 --> 02:07:41,000
Salim! What happened?

1508
02:07:42,640 --> 02:07:44,000
Who hit you?

1509
02:07:45,840 --> 02:07:48,200
Why did you do this? - What are you saying?

1510
02:07:48,640 --> 02:07:50,440
You sent your men to hit me just as you had told.

1511
02:07:50,720 --> 02:07:53,080
Who hit you? I did not send anybody.

1512
02:07:53,200 --> 02:07:54,920
I have nothing to do with that problem.

1513
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,280
The police will be here. They will take care of everything.

1514
02:07:58,400 --> 02:08:01,160
What! The police? Why are you doing this?

1515
02:08:01,280 --> 02:08:03,920
I came to apologize. Don't tell the police.

1516
02:08:04,480 --> 02:08:06,320
Oh!

1517
02:08:16,960 --> 02:08:18,120
They are coming again.

1518
02:08:25,200 --> 02:08:27,400
Ashok.. Ashok...

1519
02:08:28,880 --> 02:08:31,560
Ashok.. - What happened, Salim? - Ashok.

1520
02:08:31,680 --> 02:08:34,360
Ashok! - Who is inside? - Please open the door!

1521
02:08:34,720 --> 02:08:37,960
Hold him. - Ashok.. Ashok..

1522
02:08:38,480 --> 02:08:39,840
Salim! - What happened to Ashok?

1523
02:08:40,320 --> 02:08:41,720
Somebody, open the door!

1524
02:09:08,480 --> 02:09:10,680
Ashok. Ashok..

1525
02:09:11,120 --> 02:09:12,640
Ashok.. Ashok..

1526
02:09:16,720 --> 02:09:18,280
Ashok hit me..

1527
02:09:23,440 --> 02:09:26,840
Sorry, Rupa. It was Ashok..

1528
02:10:07,840 --> 02:10:09,320
Hello. - Hello, Ashok.

1529
02:10:09,840 --> 02:10:13,400
I am K4 police station's inspector, Duraipandiyan speaking.

1530
02:10:13,520 --> 02:10:15,320
Sir, I am Ashok's father, Ravindran speaking.

1531
02:10:16,240 --> 02:10:18,040
Please come to Chennai immediately.

1532
02:10:21,520 --> 02:10:22,880
The wounds are superficial. There's nothing to worry.

1533
02:10:23,040 --> 02:10:24,080
Thank you, Doctor.

1534
02:10:29,360 --> 02:10:31,120
Come, sir. Are you fine?

1535
02:10:34,240 --> 02:10:35,480
Salim, what did the doctor say?

1536
02:10:35,680 --> 02:10:39,960
I'm very sorry. - I did not have your cell number.

1537
02:10:40,800 --> 02:10:42,320
Otherwise, I would have called you earlier.

1538
02:10:42,560 --> 02:10:44,200
I had not expected, all this would happen.

1539
02:10:44,320 --> 02:10:45,720
I tried a lot to stop him.

1540
02:10:46,960 --> 02:10:48,680
Sir, they are Ashok's parents.

1541
02:10:49,200 --> 02:10:51,400
Yesterday, when you had called, I was the one who spoke to you

1542
02:10:51,520 --> 02:10:54,440
Inspector Duraipandiyan. Did your son contact you?

1543
02:10:58,600 --> 02:11:00,080
Sir, will you come aside for a minute?

1544
02:11:08,240 --> 02:11:11,200
Anything that you hide will put your son in danger.

1545
02:11:11,760 --> 02:11:13,320
Last evening, he had called me

1546
02:11:13,440 --> 02:11:14,680
saying that he was going to commit suicide.

1547
02:11:14,880 --> 02:11:16,280
We enquired about your son.

1548
02:11:16,720 --> 02:11:18,320
When he was in the 10th standard in Coimbatore

1549
02:11:18,720 --> 02:11:22,440
he had hit a boy and broke his chin for some girl.

1550
02:11:22,640 --> 02:11:24,520
It had become a police case. As he was given a TC

1551
02:11:24,640 --> 02:11:27,360
you were getting him educated here, in Chennai. Right?

1552
02:11:27,600 --> 02:11:29,080
That happened long ago, when he was very young.

1553
02:11:29,200 --> 02:11:33,480
It is not right to deal with this case by taking it up now.

1554
02:11:33,680 --> 02:11:34,800
I can understand your anger.

1555
02:11:35,120 --> 02:11:37,480
From our enquiry, it is very clear

1556
02:11:37,600 --> 02:11:38,760
that Ashok has committed this murder.

1557
02:11:38,880 --> 02:11:40,120
Not just that

1558
02:11:40,240 --> 02:11:43,560
your son has himself written

1559
02:11:44,160 --> 02:11:45,640
that he has murdered Suresh.

1560
02:11:48,960 --> 02:11:50,640
Please see if this is his handwriting.

1561
02:11:58,480 --> 02:11:59,560
It is his handwriting indeed.

1562
02:11:59,680 --> 02:12:02,320
Till your son is caught, we will not close this case.

1563
02:12:02,480 --> 02:12:04,640
If he contacts you, please inform us.

1564
02:12:05,120 --> 02:12:06,520
Do you suspect him?

1565
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:09,640
It's because, when we enquired about him

1566
02:12:09,760 --> 02:12:12,000
we found that everyone has a good opinion of him.

1567
02:12:12,720 --> 02:12:14,440
That is why, I am asking you. - No, sir.

1568
02:12:40,800 --> 02:12:41,840
Sir.

1569
02:12:44,720 --> 02:12:48,000
Sir, the groom's side are coming to see my daughter in the evening.

1570
02:12:48,480 --> 02:12:50,040
I have to buy few things before going home.

1571
02:12:50,320 --> 02:12:51,680
I had informed you in the morning itself.

1572
02:12:51,840 --> 02:12:54,440
That's fine, Kathamuthu. On your way, go to this address

1573
02:12:54,560 --> 02:12:56,200
and check whether it is the same person in the house

1574
02:12:56,320 --> 02:12:57,920
and give a report in the morning, tomorrow, okay?

1575
02:12:58,240 --> 02:12:59,560
Okay, sir.

1576
02:13:03,360 --> 02:13:04,280
She is too much!

1577
02:13:04,640 --> 02:13:06,640
Yeah, tell me. Tomato, eggplant..

1578
02:13:06,960 --> 02:13:09,880
Couldn't you have told it before? Simply nagging!

1579
02:13:10,560 --> 02:13:12,400
Keep the phone. I will come.

1580
02:13:41,760 --> 02:13:43,760
Who do you want to see, sir? - Is anyone home?

1581
02:13:44,160 --> 02:13:45,600
Dad is there. Come inside.

1582
02:13:49,440 --> 02:13:50,560
Sit down, sir.

1583
02:13:52,640 --> 02:13:54,320
Sir, dad is calling. - Go ahead.

1584
02:14:27,760 --> 02:14:29,560
Two minutes, sir. - No problem.

1585
02:14:53,360 --> 02:14:54,440
Isn't your mom home?

1586
02:14:54,560 --> 02:14:56,040
No, sir. She is no more.

1587
02:14:56,160 --> 02:14:58,360
Nothing. I came here for a verification.

1588
02:14:58,560 --> 02:15:00,120
I will leave. - Okay, sir.

1589
02:15:23,520 --> 02:15:27,080
My life is your son, Salim's gift.

1590
02:15:27,760 --> 02:15:29,040
After Salim's death

1591
02:15:29,280 --> 02:15:30,840
you must have thought that his education and wishes

1592
02:15:31,160 --> 02:15:32,760
have died along with him.

1593
02:15:34,800 --> 02:15:37,000
I took this life

1594
02:15:37,680 --> 02:15:40,080
which would have otherwise gone waste.

1595
02:15:41,440 --> 02:15:42,880
I am not saying, what I did was correct.

1596
02:15:44,240 --> 02:15:45,600
I didn't have any other way out that day.

1597
02:15:47,120 --> 02:15:50,080
I want to live as Salim. If you permit

1598
02:15:51,760 --> 02:15:53,480
I will live as your son and look after you.

1599
02:15:56,360 --> 02:15:57,480
If you don't like it

1600
02:15:58,320 --> 02:16:02,080
I will stop this education, and let go of this identity.

1601
02:16:03,920 --> 02:16:05,120
One thing is for sure.

1602
02:16:06,160 --> 02:16:09,160
As long as I am alive, I will take care of you.

1603
02:16:11,360 --> 02:16:13,520
I want my life to be useful to someone.

1604
02:16:36,960 --> 02:16:38,280
Dad, sleep for some time.

1605
02:17:15,800 --> 02:17:17,520
