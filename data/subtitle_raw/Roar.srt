("N'chi Ya Nani"
by Robert Florczak)

2
00:02:17,055 --> 00:02:21,726
(chanting over drums)

3
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:17,031
(motorcycle engine starts)

4
00:03:25,123 --> 00:03:30,044
(uplifting music)

5
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:46,162
(stampeding)

6
00:05:04,347 --> 00:05:09,143
(roaring)

7
00:05:26,494 --> 00:05:29,747
- Okay Pop, hello buddy.

8
00:05:29,956 --> 00:05:31,999
Hello lions. What are you doin'?

9
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,335
What's that rogue,
Togar doin' here?

10
00:05:34,544 --> 00:05:36,212
(growls)

11
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,631
God Togar, why
today of all days?

12
00:05:38,798 --> 00:05:43,177
(roaring and rustling)

13
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:55,398
Okay, come on. Let's play chase.

14
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:01,696
(chase music)

15
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,374
(uplifting music)

16
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:17,003
- [Melanie] The closer we
get, more excited I get.

17
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:18,087
- [John] It should
be great seeing him

18
00:06:18,296 --> 00:06:19,297
after three years.

19
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:20,840
- [Melanie] Yeah, I
couldn't believe how fast

20
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:23,759
he split for Africa
after he got his grants.

21
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:26,095
And the zoo let him take
the little cubs he raised.

22
00:06:26,304 --> 00:06:28,139
- [John] You'd think he'd
take the kids he raised.

23
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:29,390
- [Madelaine] Well he
was going to send for us,

24
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:31,392
but he said it
was too dangerous.

25
00:06:31,601 --> 00:06:34,145
He certainly didn't leave
because he didn't love us.

26
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:35,605
And you know how
depressed he used to get

27
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:39,108
with his cats kept in
cages all the time.

28
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,321
I wonder where he is.

29
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:45,239
- Why don't we try to
find our own way there?

30
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:46,741
- You're joking.

31
00:06:46,908 --> 00:06:51,287
- Where could he be?

32
00:06:53,289 --> 00:06:55,082
- Boy you guys wait 'til my
family gets here tonight.

33
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:58,085
Are they gonna love you.

34
00:06:58,294 --> 00:07:03,215
(cute music)

35
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:20,691
(trumpeting)

36
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:25,655
(roaring)

37
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:34,205
(boat idling)

38
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:39,710
- Oops, sorry Hank.

39
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,087
- And I thought you
came to help me.

40
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:42,338
- I did.

41
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:44,006
I came to speak for you
with that committee,

42
00:07:44,215 --> 00:07:45,800
and take you to
pick up your family.

43
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:47,969
- Well come on ashore a while.

44
00:07:48,177 --> 00:07:49,470
- Are you crazy?

45
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:53,182
The committee is on their
way here to renew your grant.

46
00:07:53,391 --> 00:07:54,642
Monster.

47
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:57,144
- [Hank] Come on, you gotta
help me clean the house.

48
00:07:57,311 --> 00:07:59,188
- Mmm, not today;
today doesn't seem like

49
00:07:59,397 --> 00:08:02,191
a good day to come in.

50
00:08:02,358 --> 00:08:06,070
Hey where are you going?

51
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:15,204
Not my jacket!

52
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:26,257
- Throw it here.
Come on over here.

53
00:08:31,137 --> 00:08:34,348
- [ Mativo] Stay
there. How's she doing?

54
00:08:34,557 --> 00:08:36,600
- [Hank] Look.

55
00:08:39,145 --> 00:08:40,938
(growling)

56
00:08:41,147 --> 00:08:42,106
- [Mativo] This is a madhouse.

57
00:08:42,273 --> 00:08:43,816
- No it isn't. It's
just like life.

58
00:08:43,983 --> 00:08:45,985
You get the funny
with the tragic.

59
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:47,153
It's just with them you get

60
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:48,487
the gentle and
the ferocious too.

61
00:08:48,654 --> 00:08:51,907
Be careful of the bad,
and enjoy the good.

62
00:08:52,074 --> 00:08:53,075
- [Mativo] You aren't
careful enough.

63
00:08:53,284 --> 00:08:54,243
- Well for my
studies I have to get

64
00:08:54,452 --> 00:08:58,789
as close to them as possible.

65
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:01,542
You know, actually, the
closer you get to them,

66
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:05,046
the more they'd like you
and the safer you'd be.

67
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:07,548
- But look! He's
going to jump on us.

68
00:09:07,757 --> 00:09:11,552
- No no no no,
they're just playing.

69
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:15,056
They like to play the
old cat and mouse game.

70
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:16,182
Here I'll cover ya.

71
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:19,018
Oh big John.

72
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:23,022
No, if you just look at
'em, or you run at em.

73
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,273
Raaaaah

74
00:09:24,482 --> 00:09:25,357
(stammering)

75
00:09:25,524 --> 00:09:27,026
- No look.

76
00:09:27,193 --> 00:09:31,864
- What? Oh ah ah ah ah,
you leave him alone.

77
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,955
Oh that's Johnny Lion, you
never have to worry about John.

78
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:42,958
Are you scaring him?

79
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,252
You know you gotta
watch out for Mark.

80
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:48,756
No, he's okay. This is Charlie.

81
00:09:48,923 --> 00:09:50,299
(Hank meows)

82
00:09:50,466 --> 00:09:52,384
And you gotta watch
out for Barry, okay?

83
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:55,137
(roaring)

84
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:59,266
It's just playing
I'm tellin' ya.

85
00:09:59,475 --> 00:10:00,810
- [Mativo] But you
could get killed.

86
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:04,897
- The cats got a little
excited, that's all.

87
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:11,987
(Hank meowing)

88
00:10:12,154 --> 00:10:14,281
- [Mativo] Are you
okay? You're crazy.

89
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:17,493
(Hank meows)

90
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:20,496
- Oh Mativo, there's Robbie.

91
00:10:20,663 --> 00:10:22,289
You've never met Robbie.

92
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:23,958
He's always out
guarding his borders

93
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,543
in the daytime,

94
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:27,002
and you're always
too afraid to come

95
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:28,963
and visit me at night.

96
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:32,758
Now he's the nicest
cat in the world.

97
00:10:32,967 --> 00:10:35,928
And he's also the top cat here.

98
00:10:36,137 --> 00:10:38,055
Yeah. He's the boss.

99
00:10:38,264 --> 00:10:39,557
I work for him.

100
00:10:39,765 --> 00:10:40,474
Hey Rob,

101
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:42,268
(Hank meowing)

102
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:46,313
Well come here. I want
you to meet Mativo.

103
00:10:48,983 --> 00:10:51,110
See actually it's Robby
I'm worried about.

104
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:55,489
Their whole life is
based on dominance.

105
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:57,658
That's why we have such
a great harmony here,

106
00:10:57,867 --> 00:11:01,537
because Robbie is such a
gentle and loving ruler.

107
00:11:01,704 --> 00:11:05,124
(Hank meows)

108
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:09,336
He also knows he has to protect
the others from outsiders.

109
00:11:09,545 --> 00:11:12,256
Right now he's very
worried about Togar.

110
00:11:12,423 --> 00:11:15,301
He's also worried that if the
others see that he's worried

111
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:20,097
or afraid, that then they'll
start challenging him

112
00:11:20,264 --> 00:11:23,434
like they've been
each other all day.

113
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:29,565
No matter how afraid
he is at this moment,

114
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:33,235
he still knows he has
to see this through.

115
00:11:34,195 --> 00:11:38,032
The whole meaning of his
life is before him, Mativo.

116
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,620
(Hank cooing and meowing)

117
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:45,164
That's why you have to help me.

118
00:11:45,331 --> 00:11:47,291
- I have to what? Why?

119
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:50,127
- Because I have to
help him, Mativo.

120
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:55,424
And he could get killed.

121
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:00,846
Don't worry, I'm gonna help ya.

122
00:12:01,055 --> 00:12:05,100
- I don't think you
should count on me.

123
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:07,811
But Only yesterday
they were so happy.

124
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,188
Now look at them.

125
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:11,148
- Finally on the verge
of finding paradise,

126
00:12:11,357 --> 00:12:12,816
and the only thing
lacking is my family

127
00:12:13,025 --> 00:12:13,776
to share it with me.

128
00:12:13,943 --> 00:12:15,778
And Togar comes in wrecking it.

129
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:17,404
- Here comes trouble.

130
00:12:17,613 --> 00:12:21,992
It's a grand committee,
but Prentiss is with them.

131
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:25,371
(roaring)

132
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:29,333
Listen my friend, let me talk.

133
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:32,211
Good morning everybody.

134
00:12:32,378 --> 00:12:33,462
I would like to
open this meeting

135
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:36,882
by reminding you all that

136
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:40,135
Hank's original idea
was a comparative study

137
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:42,888
of the great cats of the wild.

138
00:12:43,097 --> 00:12:45,891
And while observing
the African cats

139
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,520
in their natural habitat,
he will raise several cats

140
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:51,981
of each species.

141
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:55,359
Be they African or otherwise.

142
00:12:55,526 --> 00:12:59,154
And to become almost like
a member of the pride.

143
00:12:59,363 --> 00:13:04,243
- Hey it has stripes! It must
be another Tigon or a Liger.

144
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:06,120
(meowing)

145
00:13:06,328 --> 00:13:09,039
The mother's a lioness,
the father must be a tiger.

146
00:13:09,248 --> 00:13:10,958
Say hello to Henry
the Jaguar, would ya?

147
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:11,750
- Not today.

148
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:15,129
(hissing)

149
00:13:15,296 --> 00:13:17,006
- What are you trying to prove?

150
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:19,174
That you can have lions
socializing with people?

151
00:13:19,383 --> 00:13:21,802
- No, but we can't keep
exterminating them.

152
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:24,596
We can't keep
eliminating their land.

153
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:26,307
We can't keep
exterminating everything

154
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:29,143
that we fear, or that
inconveniences us.

155
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:31,020
- Let the zoos keep them alive.

156
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:33,731
- Prentiss, your actions
aren't necessary.

157
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:35,190
The government knows
there's a better way.

158
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:36,108
They're moving the people out of

159
00:13:36,317 --> 00:13:38,110
the migration paths.

160
00:13:38,319 --> 00:13:39,361
I don't know what kind of person

161
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:40,946
could look in the
eyes of 200 elephants

162
00:13:41,155 --> 00:13:43,115
and put out those lights.

163
00:13:43,324 --> 00:13:44,533
They run frantically in panic

164
00:13:44,742 --> 00:13:45,993
trying to protect
their children--

165
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:47,161
- Do you think your lions
would run and panic?

166
00:13:47,328 --> 00:13:48,996
- You better start
with me first.

167
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:51,874
- No I'll start with
the tigers first.

168
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:55,002
That'll teach you for
bringing them to Africa.

169
00:13:55,169 --> 00:13:59,173
(roaring)

170
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:07,014
- I gotta go help your uncles;
they're killing each other.

171
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:12,019
(roaring)

172
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:17,191
Stop it! Stop It! Hey! Hey!

173
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:23,280
Calm down!

174
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:34,458
Togar!

175
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,585
Hey!

176
00:14:36,752 --> 00:14:39,046
Hey!

177
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:44,134
Hey!

178
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:47,971
Hey!

179
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:51,725
Togar! Togar!

180
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:54,269
Ah!

181
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:58,357
Ah!

182
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:08,117
Ow!

183
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:12,121
(Hank meows)

184
00:15:15,124 --> 00:15:19,253
You stay out of it. You let
Robbie take care of him.

185
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:22,548
Yeah, you guys are smart;
you stayed out of it.

186
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:25,926
Oh Craig, hi Tommy, Jimmy.

187
00:15:26,135 --> 00:15:27,678
(Hank meows)

188
00:15:27,886 --> 00:15:30,055
Oh aw. You hide in here?

189
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:38,272
I don't blame you, all
those guys are fighting.

190
00:15:38,439 --> 00:15:40,524
(roaring)

191
00:15:40,691 --> 00:15:45,195
(splashing)

192
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:20,814
- [Man in hat] Over the
side! This way! Git!

193
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:24,985
(panicked shouting)

194
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:27,112
- That's my jacket.

195
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,907
(panicked shouting)

196
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:37,956
(splashing)

197
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:46,089
- Help!

198
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,680
- Hank!

199
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:04,233
- [Prentiss] Hank get out here!

200
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:09,905
(roaring)

201
00:17:14,743 --> 00:17:19,206
(splashing)

202
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:24,711
- Hank! Hank!

203
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:28,549
- [Hank] Hey! Hey!

204
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:34,179
- [Prentiss] Hank get out here!

205
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:37,641
(splashing)

206
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:44,648
(screaming)

207
00:17:58,245 --> 00:18:00,122
- Get him off me!

208
00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:05,168
(roaring)

209
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:10,299
- [Prentiss] Run!

210
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:14,219
- [Man in Blue] Woah hey.

211
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:20,142
(yelling)

212
00:18:31,695 --> 00:18:36,116
- Hey! Hey!

213
00:18:36,325 --> 00:18:40,912
Come on, go in the house
and get some bandages.

214
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:42,748
Oh what the hell's
wrong with you?

215
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:45,125
All you got's a few scratches.

216
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:47,544
You're lucky Togar
didn't getcha.

217
00:18:47,753 --> 00:18:51,465
(boat engines revving)

218
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:58,055
- I think you
should take our bus.

219
00:18:58,263 --> 00:18:59,014
It goes right by there.

220
00:18:59,181 --> 00:19:02,017
- Oh no, well I
think we should wait.

221
00:19:02,184 --> 00:19:05,520
- No; if you wait until
tonight, and it doesn't come,

222
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:07,397
there is no other
bus for two days.

223
00:19:07,606 --> 00:19:12,027
And there is no place
for you to stay here.

224
00:19:12,194 --> 00:19:15,280
Well what'll we do?

225
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:19,326
- [John] Will he know
where to take us?

226
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:24,164
- Oh come on. I'll
tell him for you.

227
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:31,004
(crowd chatter)

228
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:37,969
(bus engine starts)

229
00:19:44,393 --> 00:19:48,355
- Hey, she's dry.
Alice has no milk.

230
00:19:48,522 --> 00:19:50,148
Listen, I have to go change.

231
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:51,149
- I'll go back to my boat.

232
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:52,234
- Okay.

233
00:19:52,401 --> 00:19:54,236
- Maybe I'll come with you.

234
00:20:00,701 --> 00:20:02,369
- If he claws ya,--

235
00:20:02,577 --> 00:20:03,954
- What do I do now?

236
00:20:04,121 --> 00:20:05,664
- just stand up to
them, don't let them

237
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:06,998
get away with anything.

238
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:08,959
You gotta let 'em see
how strong you are.

239
00:20:09,126 --> 00:20:11,670
Come on lions. We have to
clean the house for Madelaine.

240
00:20:11,837 --> 00:20:13,130
Come on lions.

241
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:16,133
(roaring)

242
00:20:17,718 --> 00:20:18,760
Come on lions.

243
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:21,179
Come on Diane. Come on Michael.

244
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:23,932
Come on Patrick.

245
00:20:24,099 --> 00:20:25,726
(roars)

246
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:29,479
- Are you sure there aren't
any more big ones in here?

247
00:20:34,985 --> 00:20:38,655
- Well hello Gary.

248
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:39,948
(Hank meows)

249
00:20:40,115 --> 00:20:41,032
Why didn't you go with your--

250
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:42,993
(roars)

251
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:44,536
Why didn't you go
with your friends?

252
00:20:44,745 --> 00:20:45,954
(roars)

253
00:20:46,163 --> 00:20:47,330
Aww.

254
00:20:47,539 --> 00:20:48,665
(roars)

255
00:20:48,832 --> 00:20:50,876
Come on, you should
go with your friends.

256
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:54,671
(roars at length)

257
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,089
(Hank roars)

258
00:20:56,298 --> 00:20:57,007
(roars)

259
00:20:57,174 --> 00:20:58,175
Aw come on.

260
00:20:58,383 --> 00:20:59,426
- You really changed this place.

261
00:20:59,634 --> 00:21:02,095
New curtains, new
drapes, new everything.

262
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:04,681
- Come on, go with your friends.

263
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:06,057
(Hank meows)

264
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:08,226
Come on. Oh yes.

265
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:09,978
You have to go
with your friends.

266
00:21:10,145 --> 00:21:11,938
Come on.

267
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:14,566
Oh. Aw.

268
00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:19,196
(Hank meowing)

269
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:20,947
Come on.

270
00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:25,160
Aw don't worry Davie.
Robbie can handle Togar.

271
00:21:25,327 --> 00:21:29,080
Your father's tougher
than you think.

272
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:32,167
Come on.

273
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:32,959
(Hank meows)

274
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:34,544
Oh come on, you'll hurt my hand.

275
00:21:34,753 --> 00:21:37,422
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.

276
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:39,007
See I got a hand hurt.

277
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:43,970
(Hank meows)

278
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:47,182
Come on. Come on Davie.

279
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:52,145
(roaring in protest)

280
00:21:54,231 --> 00:21:58,026
(Hank meows)

281
00:21:58,235 --> 00:22:01,446
I think I drove Togar as
far away as 200 miles.

282
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:04,574
This is the first
time he's come in.

283
00:22:04,783 --> 00:22:06,034
I have a hunch that
Robbie and Togar

284
00:22:06,243 --> 00:22:08,078
could be brothers.

285
00:22:08,286 --> 00:22:10,705
You know Bugsy and Robbie
were both rogue lions.

286
00:22:10,914 --> 00:22:13,124
I found them dying
from battle wounds.

287
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,043
Now if Togar were sick or dying,

288
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:17,712
these guys'd
probably accept him.

289
00:22:17,921 --> 00:22:19,172
But the way he is now, --

290
00:22:19,381 --> 00:22:20,340
- Vicious alright.

291
00:22:20,507 --> 00:22:21,925
- Well he can't help that.

292
00:22:22,092 --> 00:22:24,719
As a loner he's too slow to
catch his normal dinners.

293
00:22:24,928 --> 00:22:27,305
And the hungrier he gets,
the more desperate he gets.

294
00:22:27,472 --> 00:22:30,016
The more desperate he gets,
the more ferocious he gets,

295
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:32,727
because the only way he
can eat most of the time

296
00:22:32,936 --> 00:22:36,940
is by taking his meals
from whole prides of lions.

297
00:22:37,107 --> 00:22:38,984
You gotta be pretty
ferocious to do that.

298
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:40,235
(roars)

299
00:22:40,402 --> 00:22:43,613
Sooner or later, he's
gonna get killed.

300
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,907
Come on Gary.

301
00:22:46,116 --> 00:22:49,870
♪ Why'd I ever leave
Madelaine alone

302
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:54,082
♪ Make me believe you
would never leave

303
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:57,377
♪ It couldn't hurt to pretend

304
00:22:57,586 --> 00:23:01,298
♪ Why'd I ever leave
Madelaine alone

305
00:23:04,885 --> 00:23:09,097
(Hank meowing)

306
00:23:09,306 --> 00:23:11,683
Billy.

307
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:13,101
(mischievous music)

308
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:16,605
- Hey, don't try to frighten me.

309
00:23:16,771 --> 00:23:19,024
Leave that alone!

310
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:22,277
That's my jacket!

311
00:23:25,947 --> 00:23:28,408
Hey Hank, come and help me.

312
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:33,163
He's got my jacket!

313
00:23:33,371 --> 00:23:36,666
Gimme that Jacket.
That's my jacket!

314
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:38,418
Hey!

315
00:23:38,585 --> 00:23:42,047
(roaring)

316
00:23:47,218 --> 00:23:49,596
Hank!

317
00:23:52,933 --> 00:23:55,936
Hank! Help!

318
00:23:59,773 --> 00:24:01,733
Help! Help!

319
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:06,655
- Hey! Hey!

320
00:24:06,821 --> 00:24:09,449
Get back. Come on.
You leave him alone.

321
00:24:09,658 --> 00:24:14,162
Leave him alone.
Hey! Leave him alone.

322
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:20,710
- They almost killed me.

323
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:22,921
- You know you're
not supposed to run.

324
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:26,049
- My head knew it,
but my feet didn't.

325
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:29,177
(roaring)

326
00:24:29,386 --> 00:24:33,765
- Oh. Hi babe. Oh.

327
00:24:37,727 --> 00:24:39,187
- [Mativo] Put them out.

328
00:24:39,396 --> 00:24:41,481
- They're trying to
stay away from Togar.

329
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:42,649
Come on.

330
00:24:42,857 --> 00:24:44,192
- Why do they have
to be in here?

331
00:24:44,401 --> 00:24:45,610
Why this open door
policy you have here

332
00:24:45,777 --> 00:24:47,153
anyway with them?

333
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,448
- All the doors are closed
except for here and the bathroom.

334
00:24:50,615 --> 00:24:52,951
There's nothing they can
tear up here or the bathroom.

335
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:54,452
- Put them out.

336
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:55,954
- Mativo this is their home!

337
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:57,205
- What do you think
you're running?

338
00:24:57,372 --> 00:24:58,415
A country club for lions?

339
00:24:58,581 --> 00:24:59,749
- Come on, sit down here.

340
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:00,750
(roaring)

341
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:03,169
Aww.

342
00:25:06,923 --> 00:25:09,968
Sit down. You're okay. Oh.

343
00:25:12,303 --> 00:25:14,931
(roaring)

344
00:25:15,098 --> 00:25:18,018
Sit down. You're okay, sit down.

345
00:25:18,226 --> 00:25:21,146
(roaring)

346
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,985
Hey aww.

347
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:33,116
Hey no more fighting.

348
00:25:33,324 --> 00:25:34,993
Come here.

349
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,163
Aww. Sit down. You're okay.

350
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:39,039
Poor David
- [Mativo] You are okay.

351
00:25:39,247 --> 00:25:40,623
You are okay.

352
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:44,085
These stupid lions
are frightening me.

353
00:25:44,294 --> 00:25:45,045
And you want to bring Madelaine

354
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:46,546
and the children into this?

355
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:49,132
- This'll be great for 'em.

356
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:53,053
Not boxed in like
back in Chicago.

357
00:25:55,722 --> 00:25:58,308
Hey, wait a minute.

358
00:25:58,475 --> 00:26:02,312
(soothing music)

359
00:26:19,454 --> 00:26:24,375
(roaring)

360
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:34,552
I just thought he had
a cataract starting.

361
00:26:35,512 --> 00:26:37,472
That's Billy. He's great.

362
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:43,144
- They're right. You
be on something. I
couldn't last a day.

363
00:26:43,353 --> 00:26:45,563
Expect her to sleep
with the lions are you?

364
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:49,901
- What do you care if
I sleep with my wife?

365
00:26:50,944 --> 00:26:55,490
(bus chatter)

366
00:26:57,909 --> 00:26:59,077
- Mom, did you know that a man

367
00:26:59,285 --> 00:27:02,205
can have as many wives
as he wants to here?

368
00:27:02,372 --> 00:27:04,582
- And what is that
supposed to mean?

369
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:06,084
- I mean how could
you be away from dad

370
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:07,669
for so long?

371
00:27:07,877 --> 00:27:10,046
- You know that your father
and I were having problems,

372
00:27:10,213 --> 00:27:12,132
and we thought it would be
better to be apart for a while.

373
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:14,843
You know, absence makes
the heart grow fonder?

374
00:27:15,051 --> 00:27:16,094
- The heart maybe,
but what about

375
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:18,346
the sex glands?

376
00:27:18,513 --> 00:27:20,807
- Sex is all you think
about lately young lady.

377
00:27:21,015 --> 00:27:22,058
You'd better watch it,
or you're gonna get

378
00:27:22,225 --> 00:27:25,145
your little tail in trouble.

379
00:27:25,311 --> 00:27:26,938
Some day I hope you'll
understand the beauty

380
00:27:27,105 --> 00:27:28,731
of restraint and self-denial.

381
00:27:29,732 --> 00:27:31,985
- Well I hope it wasn't
restraint and self-denial

382
00:27:32,152 --> 00:27:35,947
that drove dad away.

383
00:27:36,156 --> 00:27:37,574
- [Hank] ♪ Isn't it time

384
00:27:37,782 --> 00:27:39,159
♪ That we stop

385
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:40,410
Hey Mativo.
- [Mativo] Yeah?

386
00:27:40,577 --> 00:27:41,619
- [Hank] You know what
my kids used to do

387
00:27:41,786 --> 00:27:43,496
every time I started to sing?

388
00:27:43,663 --> 00:27:48,042
They'd hold their hands over
their ears and say, oh no.

389
00:27:48,251 --> 00:27:50,336
Or they'd turn on the radio.

390
00:27:50,503 --> 00:27:54,299
- Hey, hey, don't
let them in the boat.

391
00:27:54,507 --> 00:27:57,760
- [Mativo] You're crazy.

392
00:27:57,969 --> 00:28:02,015
(bus chatter)

393
00:28:04,726 --> 00:28:08,605
- [John] I think he said
it's just over the hill.

394
00:28:08,771 --> 00:28:13,234
(trumpeting)

395
00:28:22,577 --> 00:28:23,703
- ♪ You'll never guess

396
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:27,582
♪ How many dreams I
dreamed about her

397
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:32,212
♪ Or just how empty they
all seem without her

398
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:36,966
♪ So kiss me once,
kiss me twice,

399
00:28:37,133 --> 00:28:40,386
♪ And kiss me once again

400
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:41,429
♪ It's been a long--

401
00:28:41,638 --> 00:28:42,347
(crashing)

402
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:45,808
- [Mativo] I can't steer!

403
00:28:49,354 --> 00:28:52,649
I think we are sinking.

404
00:28:52,857 --> 00:28:56,069
(engine revving)

405
00:28:59,322 --> 00:29:02,533
Abandon ship!

406
00:29:07,205 --> 00:29:11,376
- Hey Mativo. Hey Mativo,
climb out over that way.

407
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:16,256
(majestic music)

408
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:26,599
Don't swim, they'll get you.

409
00:29:26,766 --> 00:29:28,393
(splash)

410
00:29:37,694 --> 00:29:41,239
- Mom, come here and look.

411
00:29:42,907 --> 00:29:46,160
- [Madelaine] It's fantastic.

412
00:29:46,369 --> 00:29:47,161
- [John] Dad?

413
00:29:47,328 --> 00:29:48,288
- [Jerry] Dad.

414
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:51,040
- [John] Hey dad.

415
00:29:51,249 --> 00:29:56,087
(low drumming)

416
00:30:03,803 --> 00:30:06,180
Dad?

417
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,643
- [Madelaine] Hank?

418
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:20,320
- [John] Hello?

419
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:21,612
- [Madelaine] Hank?

420
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:23,948
- Dad?

421
00:30:24,115 --> 00:30:27,243
- [Madelaine] We're here.

422
00:30:29,495 --> 00:30:31,998
- Dad?

423
00:30:32,165 --> 00:30:36,836
- [Madelaine] Oh dear.

424
00:30:37,003 --> 00:30:40,131
- Hey dad.

425
00:30:44,177 --> 00:30:45,178
- Hank?

426
00:30:45,345 --> 00:30:45,970
(chirping)

427
00:30:46,179 --> 00:30:49,140
(gasps)

428
00:30:53,728 --> 00:30:55,146
- This is really a nice place.

429
00:30:55,313 --> 00:30:59,817
- [Jerry] Come on up.
This place is really wild.

430
00:31:00,026 --> 00:31:03,237
- [Melanie] I'd give
anything for some sleep.

431
00:31:04,697 --> 00:31:07,825
- I don't understand.

432
00:31:12,121 --> 00:31:13,373
- [John] Is that a tarantula?

433
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:17,251
- Huh? You simple minded jerk!

434
00:31:17,418 --> 00:31:20,755
- Stop that!

435
00:31:25,593 --> 00:31:28,096
(mattress squeaking)

436
00:31:39,273 --> 00:31:41,484
- Look.

437
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:54,080
- Oh my god.

438
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,961
- Where could he be?

439
00:32:00,128 --> 00:32:04,507
(chirping)

440
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:08,636
(Melanie laughing)

441
00:32:08,803 --> 00:32:10,430
(shudders squeaking)

442
00:32:10,596 --> 00:32:14,058
- Jerry, run and
open all the windows.

443
00:32:14,267 --> 00:32:18,187
Then we'll dust everything
and surprise your father.

444
00:32:29,031 --> 00:32:30,825
(trumpeting)

445
00:32:31,033 --> 00:32:33,411
Melanie?

446
00:32:43,004 --> 00:32:44,172
- [Jerry] Hey a motorcycle.

447
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,215
- [Madelaine] I just saw a
thing. I think it was a pelican.

448
00:32:46,424 --> 00:32:49,218
- It's a Kawasaki.

449
00:32:50,887 --> 00:32:54,807
Holy mackerel! Look at that!

450
00:32:56,225 --> 00:32:58,936
- [Madelaine] I don't
believe what I'm seeing.

451
00:32:59,103 --> 00:33:00,313
- Those can't be Dad's lions.

452
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:05,359
(roaring)

453
00:33:15,578 --> 00:33:20,041
- [Madelaine] Oh god. Look
what the cat dragged in.

454
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:27,507
(screaming)

455
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:33,095
(roaring)

456
00:33:46,776 --> 00:33:48,694
(roars)

457
00:34:02,875 --> 00:34:05,920
(roars)

458
00:34:07,213 --> 00:34:09,549
(roars)

459
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:11,926
Melanie?

460
00:34:12,093 --> 00:34:12,843
- Mom.
(gasps)

461
00:34:13,052 --> 00:34:15,596
Get in here. Get in here.

462
00:34:19,392 --> 00:34:23,145
- Jerry. John!

463
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:43,958
(yells)

464
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:45,209
- Where's mom and Mel?

465
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:47,128
- They're downstairs. Come on.

466
00:34:47,295 --> 00:34:50,840
- [John] What is
going on down there?

467
00:34:56,012 --> 00:34:58,014
- [Jerry] Let's go down.

468
00:34:58,222 --> 00:34:59,599
Woah!

469
00:35:05,104 --> 00:35:07,106
Woah Uh!

470
00:35:11,569 --> 00:35:14,322
Go back.

471
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:16,574
Ah!

472
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,828
Boy have we got troubles.

473
00:35:21,037 --> 00:35:21,996
- Where'd they all come from?

474
00:35:22,163 --> 00:35:24,332
Oh.

475
00:35:28,711 --> 00:35:28,753
Nice lion.

476
00:35:29,754 --> 00:35:30,880
(stuttering)

477
00:35:31,088 --> 00:35:33,049
Nice lion.

478
00:35:33,257 --> 00:35:36,802
(drumming intensifies)

479
00:36:01,077 --> 00:36:04,246
(labored breathing)

480
00:36:08,292 --> 00:36:11,379
(roaring)

481
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:17,301
(sniffing)

482
00:36:25,226 --> 00:36:28,979
(crashing and yelling)

483
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:37,863
(sniffing)

484
00:36:40,408 --> 00:36:43,452
(ripping)

485
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:46,872
(gasps)

486
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:10,813
- Oh no!

487
00:37:26,454 --> 00:37:30,750
(roaring)

488
00:37:55,107 --> 00:37:58,194
Oh no, oh no, oh no.

489
00:38:00,488 --> 00:38:04,158
Help? Uhh.

490
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:21,383
Ah. Ow!

491
00:38:21,592 --> 00:38:22,468
Woah!

492
00:38:22,676 --> 00:38:23,469
(crashing)

493
00:38:23,636 --> 00:38:26,096
(roaring)

494
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:37,399
(screaming)

495
00:39:22,111 --> 00:39:22,945
(knocking)

496
00:39:23,153 --> 00:39:24,113
- Melanie? Are you alright?

497
00:39:24,321 --> 00:39:25,865
- [Melanie] Yeah
but I'm scared, Mom.

498
00:39:26,073 --> 00:39:28,659
- Oh I know honey, so am I.

499
00:39:54,184 --> 00:39:57,855
Oh honey stay here.
I'll go get the boys.

500
00:39:59,356 --> 00:40:01,233
- [John] Hey. Hello.

501
00:40:01,442 --> 00:40:02,234
- John?

502
00:40:02,401 --> 00:40:05,738
- [John] I'm in here.

503
00:40:19,793 --> 00:40:24,673
(grunting)

504
00:40:28,552 --> 00:40:32,056
- John are you alright?

505
00:40:34,934 --> 00:40:36,977
Where's Jerry?

506
00:40:37,144 --> 00:40:38,729
- [Jerry] Help! Help!

507
00:40:38,896 --> 00:40:41,190
- Jerry. Jerry?

508
00:40:41,398 --> 00:40:43,067
Oh god!

509
00:40:43,275 --> 00:40:48,155
(gasping)

510
00:40:48,739 --> 00:40:49,865
Are you alright?

511
00:40:50,032 --> 00:40:51,575
- [John] You coulda suffocated!

512
00:40:51,742 --> 00:40:53,661
You coulda died dummy!

513
00:40:53,827 --> 00:40:56,080
- [Jerry] Shut
up. I almost died.

514
00:40:56,288 --> 00:40:57,122
- [John] What kinda jerk

515
00:40:57,289 --> 00:41:00,084
would hide himself in an icebox?

516
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:02,044
- Okay?

517
00:41:02,211 --> 00:41:04,672
- Yeah.

518
00:41:08,258 --> 00:41:10,469
- [Melanie] Get me outta here!

519
00:41:10,636 --> 00:41:15,099
Help! Mom! John! Jerry!

520
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:19,269
- [Madelaine] In here.

521
00:41:20,479 --> 00:41:21,438
Jerry hurry.

522
00:41:21,647 --> 00:41:22,856
- [Melanie] Right here!

523
00:41:23,065 --> 00:41:24,650
- [John] Come on.
One, two, three.

524
00:41:24,858 --> 00:41:28,278
(grunting)

525
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:32,366
(screaming)

526
00:41:32,533 --> 00:41:34,326
- Maybe there's some
guns 'round here.

527
00:41:34,535 --> 00:41:35,828
We gotta find a gun.

528
00:41:36,036 --> 00:41:38,080
- [Jerry] I think we ought
to split while we can.

529
00:41:38,288 --> 00:41:41,542
- Yeah sure with 8,000
lions and tigers outside.

530
00:41:41,709 --> 00:41:44,086
- Well if we stay here, we'll
end up being eaten alive.

531
00:41:44,294 --> 00:41:45,796
- We're not gonna get eaten.

532
00:41:46,005 --> 00:41:47,923
When Dad gets here, he'll
show us how to handle them.

533
00:41:48,132 --> 00:41:50,050
Until then, we'll just
board up the windows.

534
00:41:50,217 --> 00:41:51,510
- Wait a minute.
Who voted you in?

535
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:53,762
- I did. I suppose you
wanna make a run for it?

536
00:41:53,929 --> 00:41:56,140
- Right on. I'll take the
motorcycle and go get help.

537
00:41:56,348 --> 00:41:58,183
I know bikes, and I know
the road we came in on.

538
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:00,477
- That's not gonna help;
that's letting you escape,

539
00:42:00,644 --> 00:42:02,104
and leaving us here.

540
00:42:02,271 --> 00:42:05,065
(growling)

541
00:42:08,277 --> 00:42:13,073
(roaring)

542
00:42:19,747 --> 00:42:22,166
(screaming)

543
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:28,130
(roaring and screaming)

544
00:43:45,833 --> 00:43:48,127
- [Jerry] John! Shoot 'em!
- [John] No!

545
00:43:48,293 --> 00:43:52,131
(screaming and roaring)

546
00:43:52,297 --> 00:43:54,299
- [Jerry] John! Shoot 'em!
- [John] No!

547
00:43:59,012 --> 00:44:03,684
(triumphant music)

548
00:44:09,648 --> 00:44:14,653
(roaring)

549
00:44:28,375 --> 00:44:30,377
- Give me your
handkerchief John.

550
00:44:30,544 --> 00:44:33,130
(Melanie crying)

551
00:44:39,761 --> 00:44:41,889
I wanna go home.

552
00:44:42,055 --> 00:44:43,473
- Madelaine's gonna kill me.

553
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,392
It'll go much faster
if you go up there

554
00:44:45,559 --> 00:44:46,977
and borrow some bicycles.

555
00:44:47,144 --> 00:44:48,145
- [Mativo] Okay.

556
00:44:48,353 --> 00:44:49,062
- [Hank] I'll take the tigers.

557
00:44:49,271 --> 00:44:50,439
I'll go 'round back
of the village.

558
00:44:50,606 --> 00:44:51,648
- [Mativo] Good move.

559
00:44:51,815 --> 00:44:54,610
(speaking native
language with natives)

560
00:45:09,124 --> 00:45:14,171
(screaming)

561
00:45:14,379 --> 00:45:19,259
(curious music)

562
00:45:28,101 --> 00:45:31,438
- [Rick] Don't tell
me, he said, you said.

563
00:45:31,647 --> 00:45:33,232
I'm not interested
in your bickering.

564
00:45:33,398 --> 00:45:34,900
Who asked you to go over there?

565
00:45:35,067 --> 00:45:36,902
- [Prentiss] I can go on
any property to kill animals

566
00:45:37,069 --> 00:45:39,571
that I deem are a
danger to human lives.

567
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:41,949
- [Blonde man] Don't tell me
you care about his family.

568
00:45:42,115 --> 00:45:44,785
I'm telling you there'll be
no culling of cats, elephants,

569
00:45:44,993 --> 00:45:46,745
or any animals ever again.

570
00:45:46,912 --> 00:45:48,163
- [Prentiss] Well you should
have been at his madhouse

571
00:45:48,372 --> 00:45:49,998
and seen those
cats this morning.

572
00:45:50,165 --> 00:45:51,583
- I don't care what you say.

573
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:54,336
You are not going to go out
there and slaughter his animals.

574
00:45:54,544 --> 00:45:56,046
- [Prentiss] We cull elephants
if there are too many.

575
00:45:56,255 --> 00:45:58,882
- Prentiss, you're
completely out of line.

576
00:45:59,049 --> 00:46:01,510
You are not going
to kill those cats.

577
00:46:01,718 --> 00:46:03,220
- You can tell me
what you're gonna do.

578
00:46:03,387 --> 00:46:04,346
And you can tell
me what the rest of

579
00:46:04,554 --> 00:46:07,766
this committee's gonna do, Rick.

580
00:46:07,975 --> 00:46:09,935
But I'll be damned if
you're gonna tell me

581
00:46:10,102 --> 00:46:13,188
what I'm gonna do.

582
00:46:17,484 --> 00:46:19,361
- [Mativo] We can't
store two tigers.

583
00:46:19,569 --> 00:46:21,488
- [Hank] Well I tried
to make them go home.

584
00:46:21,697 --> 00:46:22,406
- [Mativo] How come
they are not doing

585
00:46:22,614 --> 00:46:23,657
what you are telling them.

586
00:46:23,824 --> 00:46:24,533
- [Hank] Well they're
not trained pets.

587
00:46:24,741 --> 00:46:26,576
They're just friends.

588
00:46:29,079 --> 00:46:32,082
Stay off my back.

589
00:46:36,128 --> 00:46:37,796
Come on. Where are you going?

590
00:46:38,005 --> 00:46:39,840
Come on down.

591
00:46:40,048 --> 00:46:42,134
- You go. I'm not going.

592
00:46:42,301 --> 00:46:43,427
- You know, you're right.

593
00:46:43,593 --> 00:46:45,012
I can't go to the
airport with them.

594
00:46:45,178 --> 00:46:47,014
They'll go right in with me.

595
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:49,349
Hey I got an idea for ya.

596
00:46:49,558 --> 00:46:50,851
Hang down off that branch.

597
00:46:51,059 --> 00:46:51,852
- [Mativo] Huh?
- Let your feet

598
00:46:52,019 --> 00:46:53,061
hang down here.

599
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:54,062
- [Mativo] What?
- Kick your feet.

600
00:46:54,271 --> 00:46:55,063
They'll jump right
up and try to getcha.

601
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:55,772
Then they'll stay here.

602
00:46:55,981 --> 00:46:56,690
I can sneak away.

603
00:46:56,857 --> 00:46:59,234
- No, no. I'm not doing that.

604
00:46:59,443 --> 00:47:02,029
- Listen.
- [Mativo] Uh huh?

605
00:47:02,195 --> 00:47:04,072
- Take your shirt off, okay?

606
00:47:04,281 --> 00:47:06,283
And dangle it down.

607
00:47:06,491 --> 00:47:10,078
Hold it by the sleeve.

608
00:47:11,705 --> 00:47:16,376
There you go.

609
00:47:16,585 --> 00:47:20,047
(roaring playfully)

610
00:47:28,388 --> 00:47:31,183
- Hurry back!

611
00:47:32,225 --> 00:47:35,187
- ♪ You make me feel so alive

612
00:47:35,354 --> 00:47:38,940
♪ Make me feel like
living on and on

613
00:47:39,107 --> 00:47:42,027
♪ You make me feel so alive

614
00:47:42,194 --> 00:47:43,612
♪ There's more to life

00:47:43,779 --> 00:47:47,157
♪ There's so much more to
life than meets the eye

616
00:47:47,324 --> 00:47:51,995
♪ It takes a lot to see
the forest for the trees

617
00:47:52,162 --> 00:47:55,082
♪ You make me feel so alive

618
00:47:55,248 --> 00:47:59,378
♪ And I thank you
love for showing why

619
00:47:59,586 --> 00:48:03,382
♪ There's more to life

620
00:48:03,548 --> 00:48:07,052
(roaring)

621
00:48:07,219 --> 00:48:11,473
(frogs croaking)

622
00:48:22,275 --> 00:48:23,652
- [Melanie] Why did
you bring us here.

623
00:48:23,819 --> 00:48:25,320
We're just gonna die.

624
00:48:25,487 --> 00:48:26,947
- No we are not going to die.

625
00:48:27,114 --> 00:48:28,115
(sobbing)

626
00:48:28,323 --> 00:48:28,907
Your father is going
to be here soon.

627
00:48:29,074 --> 00:48:30,033
And it'll be all over.

628
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:32,119
- Well why isn't he here now?

629
00:48:32,285 --> 00:48:35,163
He knew we were coming!

630
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:38,542
You can belly-ache all you
want about him staying away.

631
00:48:38,708 --> 00:48:41,586
But if he's not here
it's because he's dead.

632
00:48:41,753 --> 00:48:45,382
And he's not coming. I know it.

633
00:48:46,216 --> 00:48:51,054
(soothing music)

634
00:48:59,187 --> 00:49:03,442
(crickets chirping)

635
00:49:11,283 --> 00:49:12,159
- [Prentiss] Boy I've
been ready to do this

636
00:49:12,325 --> 00:49:14,327
for a long time.

637
00:49:14,536 --> 00:49:17,080
- Don't you think
we should wait?

638
00:49:18,498 --> 00:49:19,958
- We shouldn't load
anything smaller

639
00:49:20,125 --> 00:49:23,128
than a.30-06 for a lion.

640
00:49:23,336 --> 00:49:26,089
(bicycle rattling)

641
00:50:02,125 --> 00:50:02,959
- Lenny?

642
00:50:03,168 --> 00:50:05,128
- Nah.

643
00:50:05,295 --> 00:50:08,089
Aw Leonard, Leonard, Leonard.

644
00:50:08,298 --> 00:50:09,382
- Okay.

645
00:50:09,591 --> 00:50:13,470
(giving instructions
in native language)

646
00:50:13,637 --> 00:50:15,931
- [Hank] Okay, okay.

647
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:26,566
(car engine starts)

648
00:50:54,928 --> 00:50:56,638
- Come on. Put your
bike in the trunk.

649
00:50:56,805 --> 00:50:57,973
They must be in
the house already.

650
00:50:58,181 --> 00:51:00,141
They took the bus yesterday.

651
00:51:00,308 --> 00:51:01,226
Nikki, get in the car.

652
00:51:01,434 --> 00:51:03,103
Come on. Get in the back.

653
00:51:03,311 --> 00:51:04,437
Come on Greg, get in with us.

654
00:51:04,646 --> 00:51:06,064
Come on Greg.

655
00:51:06,273 --> 00:51:07,649
That's a good boy.

656
00:51:07,857 --> 00:51:08,692
That's a good boy.

657
00:51:08,858 --> 00:51:11,611
Turn around.

658
00:51:19,786 --> 00:51:22,414
- He is trying to
close me in the trunk!

659
00:51:22,622 --> 00:51:25,292
- Hey come on, get in.

660
00:51:30,213 --> 00:51:33,967
Hey, well come on. Get in.

661
00:51:34,134 --> 00:51:36,094
- Crazy. With them in the back?

662
00:51:36,303 --> 00:51:37,387
They'll bite my head off.

663
00:51:37,596 --> 00:51:39,514
- Either get in or
walk, 'cause I'm goin'.

664
00:51:39,723 --> 00:51:42,100
- Make them walk.

665
00:51:42,267 --> 00:51:43,768
This is madness.

666
00:51:43,935 --> 00:51:45,812
- If somebody sees them
this far from my place

667
00:51:46,021 --> 00:51:47,647
They'll shoot 'em.

668
00:51:47,856 --> 00:51:48,940
(sneezes)

669
00:51:49,107 --> 00:51:50,692
(native blessing)

670
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:52,152
- These are your friends huh?

671
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:53,486
And do you know
what your friends

672
00:51:53,653 --> 00:51:56,156
are probably doing to
your family right now?

673
00:51:56,364 --> 00:51:58,325
They are making dinner of them.

674
00:51:58,491 --> 00:52:00,660
They are eating them.

675
00:52:00,869 --> 00:52:02,037
- Tivo, shut up.

676
00:52:02,203 --> 00:52:03,663
- They are sitting
around eating them,

677
00:52:03,830 --> 00:52:05,040
cracking their bones.

678
00:52:05,206 --> 00:52:06,082
- Shut up.

679
00:52:06,291 --> 00:52:07,417
- They are licking
their bones clean.

680
00:52:07,626 --> 00:52:10,837
- Shut up!

681
00:52:11,046 --> 00:52:12,047
- Who are you?

682
00:52:12,213 --> 00:52:16,051
- [Hank] Come on.

683
00:52:41,034 --> 00:52:42,410
(splashing)

684
00:52:42,619 --> 00:52:44,412
Hey! Don't go so fast.

685
00:52:44,621 --> 00:52:45,914
It's too bumpy.

686
00:52:46,122 --> 00:52:49,793
- I have to Mativo.

687
00:52:56,049 --> 00:52:58,259
- [Mativo] By the
way, do they know

688
00:52:58,426 --> 00:53:00,553
that they should not run?

689
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:01,971
You should have sent them a list

690
00:53:02,138 --> 00:53:05,892
of rules and regulations
before they came.

691
00:53:08,937 --> 00:53:12,107
(tire hissing)

692
00:53:15,026 --> 00:53:19,114
- [Hank] Aw. Poor Leonard.

693
00:53:20,198 --> 00:53:24,994
(curious music)

694
00:54:09,247 --> 00:54:11,291
(yawning)

695
00:54:32,562 --> 00:54:36,983
(playful growling)

696
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:14,646
- [Jerry] Let's get out of here.

697
00:55:14,854 --> 00:55:15,688
- [Madelaine] Only
Melanie was right.

698
00:55:15,897 --> 00:55:19,234
Let's go take the boat.

699
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:35,041
Jerry okay, you go
first. Go ahead.

700
00:55:46,386 --> 00:55:47,428
Woah. Melanie.

701
00:55:47,637 --> 00:55:48,888
Oh there's a tiger!

702
00:55:49,055 --> 00:55:49,973
(screaming)

703
00:55:50,139 --> 00:55:54,561
(roaring)

704
00:56:07,156 --> 00:56:11,369
(splashing)

705
00:56:14,163 --> 00:56:16,374
- [Melanie] Faster!

706
00:56:32,557 --> 00:56:34,100
Go John!

707
00:56:38,813 --> 00:56:40,064
(gasps)

708
00:56:43,151 --> 00:56:44,652
- John. John!

709
00:56:48,114 --> 00:56:49,073
(gasps)

710
00:56:49,282 --> 00:56:51,826
John, jump out!

711
00:57:05,924 --> 00:57:09,260
Jerry! You're going
the wrong way!

712
00:57:18,227 --> 00:57:21,314
Go John! Go!

713
00:57:21,522 --> 00:57:23,900
(screaming)

714
00:57:24,067 --> 00:57:27,987
(roaring)

715
00:57:31,741 --> 00:57:33,743
Melanie get in the boat.

716
00:57:38,665 --> 00:57:41,626
(splashing)

717
00:57:45,964 --> 00:57:47,131
Going right into shore.

718
00:57:47,298 --> 00:57:48,424
- [John] Jerry watch out.

719
00:57:48,591 --> 00:57:52,136
(screaming)

720
00:57:58,810 --> 00:58:00,395
- Go back this way.

721
00:58:00,561 --> 00:58:02,772
- Come on, sport.

722
00:58:09,946 --> 00:58:12,824
- [Jerry] Boy that was close.

723
00:58:16,119 --> 00:58:20,623
(trumpeting)

724
00:58:21,666 --> 00:58:23,835
- [Madelaine] Get away!

725
00:58:24,002 --> 00:58:24,877
Get away from me!

726
00:58:25,044 --> 00:58:29,716
(screaming)

727
00:58:29,924 --> 00:58:33,261

728
00:58:52,321 --> 00:58:53,656

00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:56,075

730
00:58:59,746 --> 00:59:01,998

00:59:02,165 --> 00:59:04,250

732
00:59:19,015 --> 00:59:22,018
(splashing, screaming
and trumpeting)

733
00:59:24,270 --> 00:59:25,605
- [John] Put her down!

734
00:59:25,772 --> 00:59:28,024
- Help me! Help me!

735
00:59:28,232 --> 00:59:29,650
- [John] Let go of her!

736
00:59:29,859 --> 00:59:33,404
(yelling)

737
00:59:33,571 --> 00:59:37,075

738
00:59:37,241 --> 00:59:40,912
(screaming)

739
00:59:43,998 --> 00:59:46,793
Help me!

(trumpeting)

745
01:00:39,053 --> 01:00:42,390
- [Hank] Aw less then ten
miles to go and we're stuck.

746
01:00:42,598 --> 01:00:43,558
- [Mativo] What's wrong?

747
01:00:43,724 --> 01:00:44,809
- The jack won't
work in the sand.

748
01:00:45,017 --> 01:00:46,477
And the more I dig, the
more the car slides.

749
01:00:46,686 --> 01:00:47,812
I'll have to run.

750
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:49,730
- But you know you're
not supposed to run.

751
01:00:49,939 --> 01:00:51,149
- You hold the tigers
back, would ya?

752
01:00:51,357 --> 01:00:52,900
So they don't tackle me.
- [Mativo] What?

753
01:00:53,109 --> 01:00:54,402
- Just use this. Use this.

754
01:00:54,610 --> 01:00:58,114
Use this. Go like that.

755
01:01:03,077 --> 01:01:08,040
(ominous music)

756
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:24,265
(gunfire)

757
01:01:24,473 --> 01:01:26,100
- Hey Prentiss,
did you see that?

758
01:01:26,309 --> 01:01:28,519
Got 'em right through the neck.

759
01:01:28,686 --> 01:01:29,770
- [John] Sooner or later--
- [Madelaine] If we're not--

760
01:01:29,979 --> 01:01:30,646
- [John] the lions
are gonna get us.

761
01:01:30,855 --> 01:01:32,148
- [Madelaine] he'll be back.

762
01:01:32,356 --> 01:01:33,232
I'm gonna go for help.
- [Melanie] Why stay here?

763
01:01:33,399 --> 01:01:33,983
Now let's make sure
that all the other doors

764
01:01:34,192 --> 01:01:35,193
in the house are secure.

765
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:37,111
- [Melanie] I hate
this place here!

766
01:01:37,278 --> 01:01:39,113
I don't think there's
a good decision.

767
01:01:39,322 --> 01:01:44,202
(mischievious music)

768
01:01:52,585 --> 01:01:53,377
- John?
- [Jerry] Hey!

769
01:01:53,544 --> 01:01:55,171
- I'm gonna get help!

770
01:01:55,338 --> 01:01:56,380
- And leave us here?

771
01:01:56,589 --> 01:01:57,882
- I'm gonna get help.

772
01:01:58,090 --> 01:01:59,967
- I thought it was suicide!

773
01:02:00,134 --> 01:02:01,052
- Good luck, son.

774
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:03,971
(bike engine revving)

775
01:02:20,279 --> 01:02:22,031
- Oh no!

776
01:02:28,162 --> 01:02:29,997
(engine stalling)

777
01:02:32,250 --> 01:02:34,001
Ah!

778
01:02:34,210 --> 01:02:36,587
(curious music)

779
01:02:36,754 --> 01:02:38,923
(bike starting)

780
01:03:06,367 --> 01:03:08,411
(splashes)

781
01:03:15,668 --> 01:03:17,712
Ah!

782
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:22,341
(trumpeting)

783
01:03:49,535 --> 01:03:52,913
Ow. Get out of here.

784
01:03:55,374 --> 01:03:59,587
Open the door. Come on.

785
01:03:59,795 --> 01:04:02,048
Go on. Get out of
here. Leave it!

786
01:04:02,214 --> 01:04:05,134
Go on. Leave it.

787
01:04:11,223 --> 01:04:13,309
Jerry open the door. Come on.

788
01:04:13,476 --> 01:04:16,729

789
01:04:24,653 --> 01:04:29,200
(roaring)

790
01:04:44,632 --> 01:04:48,344
- Ahhh!

791
01:04:57,103 --> 01:04:57,937
- [Jerry] What kind of jerk

792
01:04:58,145 --> 01:05:00,272
would go off the
roof on a motorcycle?

793
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:04,026
- Get off of her!

794
01:05:04,235 --> 01:05:07,321
(grunting and whimpering)

795
01:05:12,201 --> 01:05:13,828
- [Melanie] Ugh heavy.

796
01:05:13,994 --> 01:05:15,663
(roars)

797
01:05:19,041 --> 01:05:20,126
- [Melanie] No!

798
01:05:20,292 --> 01:05:23,212
(screaming)

799
01:05:26,090 --> 01:05:31,178
- Melanie. John, Jerry!

800
01:05:31,971 --> 01:05:32,847
Where are you?

801
01:05:33,055 --> 01:05:36,934
John! Jerry! Hurry!

802
01:05:37,101 --> 01:05:41,147
Melanie! Get up.

803
01:05:41,355 --> 01:05:45,401
- No no no!

804
01:05:45,568 --> 01:05:47,653
- What's wro-

805
01:05:47,862 --> 01:05:50,990
- [Jerry] Hey what are
you doin' on the floor?

806
01:05:51,198 --> 01:05:53,617
(Melanie crying)

807
01:05:53,784 --> 01:05:58,038
- John I can't get my
leg out! Ow ow ow ow!

808
01:05:58,247 --> 01:05:59,915
- [John] Come on, hurry.
Get out. I'll hold 'em.

809
01:06:00,082 --> 01:06:03,419
I'll hold 'em.

810
01:06:03,586 --> 01:06:07,047
- Melanie come here.

811
01:06:08,174 --> 01:06:12,178
(screaming)

812
01:06:17,349 --> 01:06:18,726
- [Madelaine] Oh.
Oh my goodness.

813
01:06:19,727 --> 01:06:21,395
Jerry help your sister.

814
01:06:21,604 --> 01:06:23,189
- [Jerry] He's just
tryin' to kiss her.

815
01:06:23,355 --> 01:06:26,108
- [Madelaine] Still
trying to open the door.

816
01:06:26,317 --> 01:06:28,152
(crashing)

817
01:06:43,292 --> 01:06:46,170
(yelling and screaming)

818
01:06:52,801 --> 01:06:55,596
- [Bandaged man] You think
we have enough ammunition?

819
01:06:55,763 --> 01:06:57,056
- [Prentiss] I've got
twenty in this belt,

820
01:06:57,223 --> 01:06:59,141
and thirty in the other.

821
01:06:59,350 --> 01:07:02,645
Remember where all the cheetahs,
leopards, and tigers drop.

822
01:07:02,853 --> 01:07:05,439
We skin them on the way back.

823
01:07:05,606 --> 01:07:10,152
The lions are worthless.
Leave them for the hyenas.

824
01:07:12,696 --> 01:07:16,492

825
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:21,205

01:11:26,450 --> 01:11:28,035
(falling music)

852
01:11:28,243 --> 01:11:31,163
Ah!

853
01:11:31,371 --> 01:11:34,374
(trumpets)

854
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:40,964
(trumpeting and screaming)

855
01:11:48,305 --> 01:11:49,973
No!

856
01:11:51,683 --> 01:11:52,976
- Come on!

857
01:11:53,185 --> 01:11:57,105

- [John] Come on mom.

863
01:13:38,790 --> 01:13:41,418
- [Jerry] See ma? It's another
house. It's completely safe.

864
01:13:41,627 --> 01:13:41,752
- [Melanie] It's a good thing,

865
01:13:42,753 --> 01:13:45,172
because I can't
walk another step.

866
01:13:45,339 --> 01:13:46,840
- [Madelaine] I'm
so tired my legs

867
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:48,175
are gonna buckle under me.

868
01:13:48,383 --> 01:13:51,261
I just have to
sleep for a while.

869
01:13:53,263 --> 01:13:58,143
(curious music)

870
01:14:52,781 --> 01:14:56,076

882
01:18:22,490 --> 01:18:25,827
Togar not that way!

883
01:18:26,036 --> 01:18:30,081
Oh you poor stupid jerks.

884
01:18:30,248 --> 01:18:32,709
Togar not that way!

885
01:18:36,213 --> 01:18:39,841

886
01:19:11,289 --> 01:19:15,168
(whimpering)

887
01:19:19,214 --> 01:19:22,092
- [John] Let's try
to get 'em outside.

888
01:19:27,180 --> 01:19:30,100
- [Jerry] I don't think they're
tryin' to hurt us at all.

889
01:19:30,267 --> 01:19:33,812
- [erru] Come on. Come on lion.

890
01:19:33,979 --> 01:19:37,107

on lion. Come on.

891
01:20:00,171 --> 01:20:01,089

892
01:20:01,298 --> 01:20:02,132
(Melanie laughing)

893
01:20:02,299 --> 01:20:04,467
- [John] Come on.

894
01:20:06,177 --> 01:20:09,180
- [Madelaine] Melanie, John,
get away from those lions.

895
01:20:09,389 --> 01:20:11,141
- [Melanie] Mom, if
they wanted to get us,

896
01:20:11,349 --> 01:20:13,560
they would have done it
while we were asleep.

897
01:20:13,727 --> 01:20:14,894
- [Jerry] Come on.

898
01:20:15,061 --> 01:20:16,146
(roars a tiny roar)

899
01:20:16,354 --> 01:20:16,980
- [Madelaine] Are you
sure it's alright?

900
01:20:17,147 --> 01:20:18,815
- [Jerry] Uh huh.

901
01:20:18,982 --> 01:20:20,150
(squeaks)

902
01:20:20,317 --> 01:20:21,026
- [Madelaine] Make sure
the mother isn't around.

903
01:20:21,234 --> 01:20:22,569
- [Melanie] They're cute.

904
01:20:30,744 --> 01:20:32,787
Oh look at!

905
01:20:32,996 --> 01:20:36,499
