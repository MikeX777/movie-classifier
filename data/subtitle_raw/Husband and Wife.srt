00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,800
Why doesn't she change
her hairstyle?

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,040
You should tell her.
She looks so provincial now.

11
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,240
Moreover, as she has no kid
she has time for herself

12
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,160
and she doesn't live
with her in-laws like me.

13
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,280
Life is easy with her.

14
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,880
I wawed like a child.

15
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,360
I have to leave now, my husband
should be home early today

16
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,160
Me too, I have to go.

17
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,200
Well, hurry up.

18
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,560
You're the only who can
come back home late.

19
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,280
Next time, we should meet
at my place!

20
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,680
With pleasure. It was so nice
to see you again.

21
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,400
It had been 5 years
since we met.

22
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,400
You could also rent an apartment.

23
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,880
Whatever, as long as there is no
deposit and the fee is reasonable!

24
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,000
Good evening.

25
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,880
Good evening.

26
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,680
Mr. and Mrs. Hayakawa, I'll pass on
the message right away

27
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,480
Thank you very much for your
consideration.

28
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,280
- Thank you very much.
- Not at all.

29
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,600
Here is his sister Kikuko.

30
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,360
We'll see you at the
engagement party. Goodbye.

31
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,640
Well? You feel relieved,
don't you?

32
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,840
What?

33
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,000
Mr. Hayashi wants some grilled eel.

34
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,640
Be careful. Don't mistake the head
for your thumb when you chop it off!

35
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,520
Have you already decided the
date of the engagement?

36
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,400
The next month.

37
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,760
We haven't heard of Isaku.
Is that normal?

38
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,600
Why don't you contact him?

39
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,240
He should be here soon.

40
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,120
But it's already been
two weeks!

41
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,320
He is probably must have things
to finish up.

42
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,280
At his office?

43
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,040
Yes.

44
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,000
Kikuko, you don't eat?

45
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,320
No, I'm not hungry.

46
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,200
You should go to the public bath
then.

47
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,480
It's not very busy at this hour.

48
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,480
Who'll take care of the shop?

49
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,680
- It's OK.
- He can see through the wall.

50
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,880
Stop it with the chopsticks.

51
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,000
- You will never find a husband.
- I will never marry.

52
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,280
Next time, it's your turn.

53
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,720
We should start looking
for someone.

54
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,560
You should better hurry.

55
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,520
You want to get rid of me.

56
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,720
What kind of man should we look for?
Better a shop owner than an employee.

57
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,720
- Like me!
- No way!

58
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,280
- What's wrong with that?
- I don't want him to spend all day here.

59
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,160
Graduating from the university
is useless.

60
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,000
- Tired of looking for a house?
- No.

61
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,080
She went to see her
school friends, today.

62
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,080
I'm going. See you later.

63
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,720
Thanks for the meal.

64
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,880
What is Isaku doing? He leaves her
looking for the house alone,

65
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,440
and then he comes here once
everything is ready?

66
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,040
One can't trust him.

67
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,640
It's worrying.

68
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,000
Is that not Isaku?

69
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,880
That's him. Go and fetch him.

70
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,400
Isaku has arrived.

71
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,000
- It's been a long time.
- Come in.

72
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,280
You must be tired after that
long trip in train.

73
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,840
Sorry for arriving so late.

74
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,640
Come in!

75
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,400
This neighbourhood has changed a lot,
I didn't recognise the house.

76
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,280
Thank for your consideration.

77
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,280
Welcome.

78
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:20,040
We are glad that you've been
transferred here.

79
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,440
Thank you. Sorry for causing
so much trouble.

80
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,920
Your family is fine?

81
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,760
Yes, thank you.
My parents are fine.

82
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:36,760
Really? Your sister-in-law is
settling down on the 1st floor?

83
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,760
That's why we need to find
something before she moves in.

84
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,760
It's difficult.

85
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,440
Mummy, I want an orange.

86
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,920
I want an apple.

87
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,640
- I want a persimmon.
- I want persimmon too.

88
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,360
Keep quiet!

89
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,840
I'm going!

90
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,080
Thank you very much.

91
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,880
Here I am.

92
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,040
- Isaku has arrived.
- Really? What's going on?

93
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,160
What do you mean "what's
going on"?

94
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,360
He came without notice.

95
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,440
He went past the house
without recognising it.

96
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,080
Why didn't you send a wire
to tell me you were coming?

97
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,880
I want some cigarettes and paper.

98
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,480
- Has your company done something?
- About what?

99
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,000
The house. What are you going to do?
Can't you ask them to do something?

100
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,240
My position is not so high.

101
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:54,000
But we must find something before
my sister-in-law moves in.

102
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,640
It should be all right.

105
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,520
You know, after his wife died,
he was so depressed...

106
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,200
I heard it was a love match.

107
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,960
How sweet. You could give
him some relief, couldn't you?

108
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,160
Who are you talking about?

109
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:01,240
Please, apologize for my absence.
It was the funeral for my wife.

110
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,080
Cheer up. Work should help
changing your mind.

111
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,160
If you want to go in the province,
that will hit your carrier.

112
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,280
I understand.

113
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,800
Please, accept my condolences.

114
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,760
Thank you.

115
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,960
I have been transferred here.
We will work together then.

116
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,160
At the head office...

117
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,520
Mr. Takemura!

118
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,560
Excuse me.

119
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,400
Anyway, it's harder to find a house
than a second wife.

120
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
No, not at all.
On the contrary!

121
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:28,040
I will never find someone
better than my wife.

122
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,720
It's impossible to find a house.

123
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,920
It's not easy.

124
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,280
Life is difficult.

125
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,840
Why don't you rent it to me?

126
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,440
- What?
- Your house?

127
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,840
What? My house?
But I'm living there!

128
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,800
You are by yourself. You could take
a small apartment.

129
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,080
It's not possible!

130
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,640
Or at least, you can rent me
a room.

131
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:00,360
This house is full of memories
I want to keep it as it is

132
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:05,960
and spend my days there in silence.

133
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,400
Some more sake, please.

134
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,600
Listen, I'll tell you how
I met her.

135
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,640
You already told me earlier.

136
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,840
She was a good housekeeper.

137
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:26,080
She came from a small place.
She was in such a good shape.

138
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,280
When she sat down, she could
raise a leg that high...

139
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,520
But, how could I find?

140
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:33,960
A house...

141
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,000
I'll have a look for you.

142
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,320
Thank you.

143
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,960
It's not much,
but please feel comfortable.

144
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:51,960
Help yourself.

145
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,600
Mokichi, give some sake.

146
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,800
Our house is not big.

147
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,560
Ours neither. Don't worry.

148
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,560
Congratulations!

149
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,840
The engagement party went fine.
We feel relieved.

150
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,920
Thank you very much.

151
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,440
Mokichi, give them some sake.

152
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,960
Hello. I have some boxes to deliver
for Mr. Nakahara. Is it here?

153
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,000
Already?

154
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,680
What are we going to do?

155
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,920
- How many of them?
- A lot.

156
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,280
It's not all of them, is it?

157
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,960
No. Most of it goes
somewhere else.

158
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,400
What can we do...

159
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,520
OK! Mokichi, clear those place.
You, put the stuff here.

160
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,120
- We'll move them over there.
- Thank you.

161
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,360
Excuse me, where can I
find a toy store?

162
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,720
What is it?
What are you looking for?

163
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,680
A toy store.

164
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,800
- Games!
- Yes.

165

00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,080
- This is our family from Fukagawa.
- Good evening. It's been a long time!

177
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:29,240
I remember your wedding
as if it was yesterday.

178
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,440
Time flies... It's been 4 years,
right?

179
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,760
- It's been 5 years.
- No, 6 years.

180
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,920
You're right.

181
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,480
Such a long time...

182
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,680
Mokichi, congratulations!

183
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,760
- Moving all the stuff, it was hard.
- Really?

184
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,640
- Really hard.
- Thank you so much for your help.

185
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,200
Takemura?

186
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,240
You come to see him?

187
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,120
Is he in?

188
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,960
Mr. Takemura?

189
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,400
Mr. Takemura?

190
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,680
- Be careful not to break the door.
- What is it happening to him?

191
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,720
Mr. Takemura?

192
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,600
Are you still sleeping?

193
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,080
Are you already here?

194
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,120
Takemura, come down
and open the door. Hurry!

195
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,800
I'm coming down.

196
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,680
Here they come.

197
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,720
I caught a cold.

198
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,440
Really? Here is my wife.

199
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,040
Thank you very much
for your help.

200
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,120
It's ok.

201
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,200
Come on, get in.

202
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,280
I have to clean the place.

203
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,400
Where should I put this?

204
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,200
Where could you...

205
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,000
Takemura-kun.
Can I put this one upstairs?

206
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,840
Yes, upstairs is fine.

207
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,680
- Let me do it.
- I'll put it in the closet.

208
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,320
- Don't worry.
- Really?

209
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,680
Is that your wife?

210
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,840
Can you help me?

211
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,280
Yes.

212
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,720
What's the matter?

213
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,200
Come on, help yourself.

214
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,040
Really? You don't want
anymore?

215
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,040
No really not, please?

216
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,720
While the odon are warm.

217
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,400
It taste better in good company.

218
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,520
We should thank you for helping us.

219
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,360
Without your help, we don't know
what we would have done.

220
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,000
It's hot.

221
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,160
Mr. Nakahara, don't you feel hot?

222
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,720
No.

223
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,800
It's me then...

224
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,760
Do you have some fever?

225
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,640
You should check.

226
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,880
I am sorry... with fever...

227
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,640
It's OK. A good sleep,
and it will be over!

228
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,200
You shouldn't take cold.

229
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:05,720
Mr. Takemura is 38¡2. We are causing
so much trouble. It's worrying me.

230
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,720
We should better call a doctor.

231
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,640
A doctor?

232
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,920
What if he catches pneumonia?

233
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,080
It would be our fault.

234
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,840
I'm going to buy some fresh vegetables.

235
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,720
Mr. Takemura would like some oranges.

236
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,240
Hello.

237
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,200
- Takemura is not coming today?
- No.

238
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,680
- Is he sick?
- No, not really.

239
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,280
You see? I told you.

240
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,960
No, it's me who said that.

241
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,440
Don't argue.

242
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,920
Thank you for waiting.

243
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,360
You shouldn't have bought flowers
for Takemura

244
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,240
What should I do then?

245
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,440
You should buy apples.
We can share them.

246
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,440
Takemura has a lot of success
with women.

247
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,880
Not with me.

248
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:57,960
Come on in.

249
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,440
Anybody here?

250
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,440
Your wife is not here?

251
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,200
Good evening.

252
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,720
Do we have guests?

253
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,520
Some colleagues: Ms. Fujita and Noda.
They come to see Takemura.

254
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,480
How do you do?

255
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,240
How do you do?

256
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:30,200
I shaved off his barb. Please,
he's upstairs.

257
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:35,360
Takemura. Miss Fujita and
Noda came to see you.

258
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,120
Takemura is all dressed up,
it's the right time.

259
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,680
It's difficult to shave the sideburns.

260
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:50,960
It's always too short on the left
or on the right.

261
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,400
Come on.

262
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,440
His wife is beautiful.

263
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:10,040
If I give them biscuits,
Takemura will feel ashamed.

264
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,600
Hey?

265
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:23,040
I thought you were sick,
but you look very well.

266
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,200
Today, I feel much better.

267
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,920
You don't have a picture
of your wife?

268
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,640
Do you have a vase?

269
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,400
I don't have a vase.
You can take a bucket.

270
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,880
No, it's impossible!

271
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,360
Wouldn't you have a vase
by any chance?

272
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,880
- I'll bring one right away.
- Thank you very much.

273
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,440
Takemura, one can think that
you are the tenant.

274
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,760
- Where did I put it?
- What?

275
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,440
The vase.

276
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,920
Good evening.
I brought some firewood.

277
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,320
Just put it there. I'm coming.

278
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,920
Did you find the vase?

279
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,720
I'll fill it with water.

280
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,880
It's a wedding gift.

281
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,560
Here you are.

282
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,920
Nakahara, come with us upstairs.

283
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:44,560
I should stay downstairs. My wife
has to go out shopping.

284
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,160
It's hard for your wife. So many things
to do upstairs, downstairs.

285
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,720
We have to ask them to stay for
dinner, don't we?

286
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,160
Yes.

287
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,160
I'm going to buy some things
to cook.

288
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:07,240
This weekend could you
chop wood?

289
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:11,520
He brought only big log.
That's all he had.

290
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:40,880
Here you are.

291
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,400
Thank you.

292
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,720
Just one bottle.

293
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,560
I feel today. Your cooking
is very tasty, isn't it?

294
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,040
Yes, you are right,

295
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,960
That's the first time
someone told me.

296
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,040
You're not eating with us?

297
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,880
No.

298
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,240
Come on, eat something.

299
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,120
Life of a married woman
is difficult.

300
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,360
Not at all. The husband has
to work hard all day.

301
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,960
But the wife only
takes care of the house.

302
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,800
When I was working, I liked it.

303
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,720
You were working before?

304
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,240
Yes, at a watch shop in Ginza.

305
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,960
Is it where you met
Mr. Nakahara?

306
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,040
He brought his watch supposedly
to have it repaired.

307
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,120
Many times.

308
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,040
That's not true.

309
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,280
Yes, it's true.

310
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,520
Enough speaking about me.

311
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,160
You should take care of yourself
and find someone.

312
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,720
I would like to fall in love
with someone.

313
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,600
Men are lucky, they can fall in love
several times in their lives.

314
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,920
It's better to look at the
bright side of things

315
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,360
than to stay in remembrance
of his wife.

316
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,520
I think that you've already
found someone.

317
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:05,000
Here you are. Let's eat!

318
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,160
Mr. Takemura is off sick again.

319
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,720
He had too much fun
yesterday evening

320
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,360
because of this two women
who visited him.

321
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,760
Really. He had a relapse
because of us?

322
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:35,360
I think he's spoiled and he's taking
advantage of a good-hearted person.

323
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,960
- Who is that?
- Your wife, of course.

324
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,240
I always have my bra on,
even at home.

325
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,080
After two kids, my breast is deformed.
Can you see?

326
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,400
Really?

327
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,560
You are so carefree.

328
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,520
You had children early.

329
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,520
Yes, but my husband think that
I'm not making enough effort.

330
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,520
What? That's funny.

331
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,680
It's not funny. You don't know it yet.

332
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:17,680
As years goes by, the husband grows
weary with his wife in bed.

333
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,240
What do you mean?

334
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,400
He's weary of making love
to his wife.

335
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,800
Is that what your husband
is thinking?

336
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,280
Generally speaking, all men
are like that.

337
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:38,040
They don't show it.
The woman doesn't know,

338
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,960
but they want to find
another woman.

339
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,200
It's sad.

340
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,200
But, I can understand.

341
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,640
Well, you don't deny it. It
must ring a bell to you.

342
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,200
It could happen to you, too.

343
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,840
What does a man do
when he goes out?

344
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,760
Only one man in a thousand never
cheat on his wife.

345
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,960
If he has a lot of money like yours,
maybe, but...

346
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,320
No. My husband doesn't
only go with geisha,

347
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,800
but with a girl at his office, too.

348
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,040
They call her his concubine.

349
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,600
- This is strictly between us.
- Of course.

350
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,800
I didn't know he had a mistress.
It's hard.

351
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,760
You're the only one I told about it.

352
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,400
- Don't ever mention it to Ms. Koike.
- Of course.

353
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,800
I can hear noises.

354
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,880
Is this a burglar?

355
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,200
Not at all.

356
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,440
I am sorry, but next time
I'll go with you.

357
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,320
I understand. Sometimes, one is
tired of going out with clients.

358
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,000
Thank you for going with him.

359
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:06,840
Take us to Yanagibashi.

360
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,320
Tofu.

361
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,080
Takemura!

362
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,280
I'm going.

363
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,120
Wait!

364
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:43,880
What?

365
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,920
I'm not talking to you.

366
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:21,880
My belt!

367
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,240
You scared me.

368
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,360
Where's my belt?

369
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,320
You can't find it?

370
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,440
What's the matter?

371
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,400
Where's Takemura?

372
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,840
He is not in?

373
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:39,560
Mrs. Akamatsu came today. When
I went to take her back to the station,

374
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,960
I asked him to stay at the house.

375
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,120
Are you back?

376
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,160
That's my belt!

377
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,440
Yes, I couldn't find mine, so
I took yours.

378
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,800
He was complaining, looking
everywhere for it.

379
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,400
Really? I'm sorry.

380
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,760
The neighbour came to ask me
to play chess with him.

381
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,360
It's cold.

382
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,040
Because of this visit, I haven't
cooked any thing yet. I'm sorry.

383
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,320
What is this?

384
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,120
Some meat.

385
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:29,240
But we already have some sushi.
What a pity...

386
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,320
There's some for you.
Do you want to eat now?

387
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,760
Yes.

388
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,920
It's almost 100 "Mei".

389
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:45,400
It's too much money, if we buy meat
today and tomorrow.

390
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:51,680
Sorry. It's a special offer.
That's why I bought it.

391
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,520
- I'm going to the neighbour.
- OK.

392
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,440
Excuse me.

393
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:39,680
Your move... it bothers me.

394
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,680
If it bothers you,
I take it out.

395
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,080
You are back?

396
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,840
We stayed at the exit of the theatre,
but there was few people.

397
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,560
Too bad!

398
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,280
Excuse us. We are still playing.

399
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,280
Give me some tea.

400
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,240
This is for the school fees.

401
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,560
How many times
do you have to pay?

402
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,640
Before, it was for last month.

403
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,440
Don't waste it.

404
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,120
How could you say it's a waste?

405
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,480
Tea!

406
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,560
One moment!

407
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,480
I'm back.

408
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,960
Mr. Takemura, bath is ready.

409
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,640
It smells good.

410
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,680
I'm starving.

411
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,680
Would you like to have dinner?

412
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,920
I'll cook something while you
are taking a bath.

413
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,200
Really?

414
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:09,600
Well, I've never seen
underwear like that.

415
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,080
Like what?

416
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,400
At the time of rationing,
my wife made it by herself.

417
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,840
Really?

418
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,400
Does it look strange?

419
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,000
What's this?

420
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,720
Underwear made out of a kimono.

421
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,280
It looks ridiculous.

422
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,800
Ridiculous?

423
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,560
I'll take that.

424
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,440
Look darling, this is nice.

425
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,880
Take it. I buy it for you.

426
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,040
- No, that's too expensive.
- You don't have to do it.

427
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,280
I just want to thank you.

428
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,200
You don't have to.

429
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:24,960
Let's go.

430
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,040
Let's go dancing.

431
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,120
But I'm not dressed properly.

432
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,160
It's all right.

433
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,320
Darling, can I go?

434
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,800
Nakahara, come!

435
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:28,880
Where is Nakahara?

436
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,000
What is he doing?

437
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,440
Here you are, Mr. Nakahara!

438
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,400
I was over there with my colleague.

439
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:15,280
It's for me. Just to thank you
for everything you've done...

440
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,440
You don't have to.

441
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,400
Do you want a drink?

442
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,800
No, thanks.

443
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:28,800
It'll warm you up.

444
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,880
If we were coming back home,

445
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,480
would you take care of the
fireplace and cook for me?

446
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,840
It's not my plan.

447
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,160
At last, a quiet place.

448
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:55,880
It tastes very good.

449
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,000
Really?

450
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,600
You almost never go out.

451
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,400
We should go and have dinner
somewhere every Sunday.

452
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,240
If we do that, we'll be bankrupted.

453
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:08,160
No, it could be something small
like a curry, or breaded pork.

454
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:10,960
Thank you very much.

455
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:11,960
I'm serious.

456
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,640
I don't know how to thank you.

457
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,280
You are exaggerating.

458
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,720
My wife was so different,
may she rest in peace...

459
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,600
Now, I can see woman differently.

460
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,240
Thanks to you and to what I felt
the first time I saw you.

461
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,920
Well, you are
a bit strange, tonight.

462
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,560
I'm serious.

463
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:43,360
With you, I have discovered
another type of woman.

464
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,000
It's too much.

465
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,680
Come on, one more glass.

466
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:53,440
My wife was in very good shape.
That's all she had.

467
00:43:55,160 --> 00:44:00,040
She was not beautiful. She couldn't
keep the kitchen tidy.

468
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,680
I thought that was normal.

469
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:12,200
And finally, she died, despite
her good health.

470
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,800
She had nothing special.

471
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,080
I draw the wrong number.

472
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,720
I envy your couple.

473
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,680
Mr. Takemura, life goes on.

474
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,360
You still can have hope.

475
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,920
You speak like an old lady.

476
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:32,600
It's because it's not that ideal.

477
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,120
If my husband were like you,
more joyful...

478
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:37,560
Like me?

479
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:43,240
When I married him,
he was not like that.

480
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:48,720
Now, he has no interest in anything.
Only baseball makes him thrilled.

481
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,960
I feel alone.

482
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,040
You and I are the same,
we feel lonely.

483
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:58,560
We should help each other.

484
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:00,640
All right.

485
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,600
Let's have a drink!

486
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,440
Cheers!

487
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:36,840
He is not home yet.
Wait here.

488
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,760
- Be careful.
- I'm fine.

489
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,760
Let me make your bed.

490
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,920
I can do it.

491
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,200
It's ok.
I take care of it.

492
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,080
Kikuko.

493
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:58,360
Where were you?
We looked for you everywhere.

494
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:03,000
Are you drunk? Mr. Takemura had
too many drinks, too.

495
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,480
- Had you a drink?
- Yes.

496
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:10,360
We were looking for you.
I was cold.

497
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:13,120
Where have you been?

498
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:17,880
I had a drink with Mieko Fujino.

499
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,240
Is she the shortest one of the two?
Did you see her?

500
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:23,680
What's this?

501
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,680
A shawl.
Mr. Takemura bought it for me.

502
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:29,200
You went back to that shop?

503
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:31,240
I didn't want to, but...

504
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:33,960
Give it him back!

505
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,640
Why does he offer you a gift?

506
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,680
For thanking me to help him.

507
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:51,120
And you find it natural
to accept a gift?

508
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:53,200
That's petty-minded.

509
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:56,400
All right, I'll give it back to him.

510
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,240
<i>Let's dance, Kikuko.</i>

511
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:03,160
Let's go dancing!

512
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:09,000
Nakahara, when did you come back?

513
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,200
Where were you?

514
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:16,080
We looked everywhere for you,
didn't we, Kikuko?

515
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,360
He had a drink with miss Fujino.

516
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:23,000
Really?

517
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:28,080
She took the opportunity
to get a free drink.

518
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,960
No, she's a nice girl.

519
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:36,840
Youth is so nice. She's fresh.

520
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,880
We too, we had fun.
Hadn't we Kikuko?

521
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,040
What a noise!

522
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:52,640
Don't play the music this late!

523
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,160
Are you going back home?

524
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:26,360
You don't look fine.

525
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:29,360
Is there anything interesting
to watch?

526
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:30,200
A movie?

527
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:31,920
Yes, whatever it is.

528
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:33,880
They have a special show of nice
movies for 30 yens.

529
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:56,040
Hello.

530
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:57,760
Takemura.

531
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:59,480
Are you going back home?

532
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:00,720
- Let's go together.
- All right.

533
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:04,800
Do you have any? I need some
for my wife.

534
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:06,640
I'm going.

535
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,280
Goodbye.

536
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:27,400
He is not home yet?

537
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:29,000
No.

538
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:32,960
Can I help you?

539
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:35,520
No, thanks. I'll be fine.

540
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:39,000
It's still early. I have plenty
of time.

541
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,080
Nakahara, what is he doing?

542
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:48,920
Yesterday, he was with Miss Fujino
and today they left office together.

543
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,160
I'll have a small conversation with him.

544
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:56,760
Yes.

545
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:01,680
OK then, I'm going
to the neighbour.

546
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,800
At this time?

547
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:19,920
Good evening.

548
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:53,720
You want to talk to me?

549
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,920
Nakahara, I think there is
a misunderstanding between us.

550
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:58,480
A misunderstanding?

551
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,720
Yes. I don't think you realise
what you are doing.

552
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,680
You can go out with Miss Fujino
if you want to,

553
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:09,840
but you should think about
your poor wife.

554
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:11,560
My poor wife?

555
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:14,960
It's indeed a misunderstanding.

556
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:18,560
Liar! You love my wife.

557
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:22,920
Yes, I love her.

558
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:30,920
But I'm not losing head.

559
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:33,080
My love for her...

560
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:37,200
...is like the love of children
for a beautiful rose.

561
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:39,720
I'm simply innocent.

562
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:43,440
But talking about me is
not what matters...

563
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:47,520
If you can not trust her,
it's terrible.

564
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:51,760
Our couple doesn't need
your advice.

565
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,640
I don't care what you have to say.

566
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,120
Mr. Nakahara, the boss
is waiting for you.

567
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:12,760
Nakahara, I would like
you to go to Sendai.

568
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:15,000
All right.

569
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:18,480
But can you leave
tomorrow Sunday?

570
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:20,360
Yes, no problem.

571
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:50,800
Right now, material is expensive.
When spring comes, we can get a deal.

572
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,480
Then we can find something nice.

573
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:00,640
Are you going somewhere?

574
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:06,000
- I count on you.
- OK.

575
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:23,440
- I count on you.
- OK. Have a nice trip.

576
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:00,120
Today it's Sunday,

577
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:11,720
I should fix season's decoration.

578
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:13,800
Let me help you.

579
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:18,000
Yes, please. Do you how
to drive in a nail?

580
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:28,520
Here you are.

581
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:34,160
- Like this? Is it OK?
- Yes.

582
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:14,680
Hello.

583
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:16,120
Everybody has left already.

584
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:17,200
- The boss too?
- Yes.

585
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:20,520
The boss wants that you bring
your report at Yoshikitae restaurant.

586
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:21,320
Now?

587
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:53,720
Here I am.

588
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,600
Here's the report.

589
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:02,920
It's my third year-end party.

590
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:12,520
Can you bring it to the chairman?
It's the last day before the holidays.

591
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:16,520
We'll speak about it next year,
but it's better if he reads it now.

592
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:18,920
Should I bring it to his place?

593
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:22,600
He told me he'll leave for
Atami, tonight.

594
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:25,120
But now, he must be at the
restaurant "Hanamura".

595
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:27,080
I must be going now.

596
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:30,000
We'll talk about it later.
I rely on you.

597
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,440
Are you going already?

598
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:36,720
- No.
- Goodbye.

599
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:40,640
You have something behind.

600
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:47,080
You have something hanging
behind.

601
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:53,320
It's the lining, stupid.

602
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:55,640
I'm so sorry...

603
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:58,520
What's the matter?

604
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,720
Good evening. Thank you for waiting.

605
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,720
- Is this for us?
- Yes, your wife ordered them.

606
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,560
- Here are the noodles.
- Already?

607
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:21,520
Good evening.

608
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:25,600
The noodles have arrived?
You're back?

609
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:27,240
What are you doing upstairs?

610
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:32,480
- Be careful not to spill it.
- It's all right.

611
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,360
Are you bringing them up?

612
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:44,800
My brother in law is back.

613
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:47,520
Really? There is one missing.

614
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:49,000
You're right.

615
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:55,680
I start just tasting.

616
00:59:57,080 --> 01:00:00,160
Wait, this is with vegetables. You
asked for meat!

617
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:04,040
What are you doing!

618
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:16,080
Why is it ripped like this.

619
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,520
The linen was hanging out.

620
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:20,800
And you ripped it off?

621
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:26,080
It is not funny.

622
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,080
But before, it was not
so much damaged.

623
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:32,800
You ripped all this off.
That was too strong.

624
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:34,880
Do you want to take
a bath now?

625
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:37,240
- Is it ready yet?
- It won't be long.

626
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,000
- Kikuko?
- What?

627
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:44,960
If you are not coming now,
there won't be anymore left.

628
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:46,720
No... That is not allowed.

629
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:50,720
The fire put out

630
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:54,720
Really?

631
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:58,920
I've just started it.

632
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:01,560
Sorry.

633
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:09,720
How was the trip?

634
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:12,640
I'd love to go spend
a few days somewhere.

635
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:16,160
Since the school trip,
I didn't go anywhere.

636
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:23,280
Kikuko? Kikuko?

637
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:25,320
You are hungry, aren't you?

638
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:44,840
Where are you going?

639
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:46,360
To the public bath.

640
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:48,160
- But it's almost ready here.
- Too late.

641
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:50,400
- You want some? It's a bit cold.
- No.

642
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:04,560
What happened?

643
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:08,000
I dropped it. Bring me
the floor cloth.

644
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:41,960
It's not my fault, if
I invited my sister.

645
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,200
I thought that, while you
were not here,

646
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:46,000
it's better if she stays here.

647
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:48,320
I'm very busy for year-end...

648
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:50,680
I had no intention
to have fun with her.

649
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:55,520
But once I've asked her to come
I had to take care of her.

650
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:58,280
That's why I bought some noodles.

651
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:01,680
Takemura let me do this.
Even though this bothers him.

652
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:03,800
But you can't understand this.

653
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:08,600
I want you to understand that.
I must be careful.

654
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:11,720
You just leave for the public bath,

655
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:13,640
I make dinner and waited for you.

656
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:15,360
And you come back after midnight!

657
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:17,280
Think about me.

658
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:19,640
I had to warm you dinner
several times.

659
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:22,760
You're so rude!

660
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:26,040
You told me that you'll buy
an overcoat, this year.

661
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:29,240
I never thought you would
wear that old coat again.

662
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:32,280
We've spent a lot on the wedding
of my brother and on moving houses.

663
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:35,040
I knew that I had to darn
the linen of your coat,

664
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:38,280
but you know this takes time.

665
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:43,040
Anyway, when you left,
it was not hanging out.

666
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:46,960
As you don't have anything else,
you had to be more careful.

667
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:48,240
OK, that's enough.

668
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:53,040
Because of this, you made a fool
of yourself in front of geisha.

669
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,960
Is it so embarrassing that geishas
see you like this?

670
01:03:57,640 --> 01:03:59,400
Me too, my friends are making
fun of me.

671
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:00,840
Because I'm like a country girl, now.

672
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:05,120
To save money, I'm not going
to hairdresser.

673
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:07,920
Even my kimonos are old-fashioned.

674
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:10,560
I should have turned them into futons.

675
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:12,400
You are exaggerating.

676
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:17,880
I'm making many efforts,

677
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:20,360
but you don't seems to realise it.

678
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:30,600
You don't understand how
careful I must be...

679
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:33,000
while you are not here.

680
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:41,080
Since we came here,
I have to take care of everything

681
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:44,200
and you've changed and became
aggressive.

682
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:46,200
I can't stand it anymore.

683
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:49,400
You're not the same anymore.

684
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:05,360
When Takemura wakes up,
there is miso in the kitchen.

685
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:06,400
You could warm it up for him.

686
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:14,920
When the rice pudding comes, could
you store it next to the others.

687
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:16,800
There's clean cloth for that
in the cupboard.

688
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:21,480
I have to go and think over it
by my side.

689
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:24,280
One well-cooked eel with sauce.

690
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:25,280
Thank you very much.

691
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:36,160
I envy you, having time to argue

692
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:37,840
with your husband on
New Year's Eve.

693
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:43,080
I'm really exhausted.

694
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:48,480
Do you have herring's egg?

695
01:06:57,320 --> 01:07:00,080
Hello. Does it look ugly?

696
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:03,680
No, it fits you well.

697
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:07,160
I went to the hairdresser
at 6 o'clock in the morning.

698
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:33,080
Are you hungry?

699
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:36,000
Yes.

700
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:53,480
Thank you.

701
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:09,120
You are not going back?

702
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:10,360
No.

703
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:11,920
Why not?

704
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:15,040
You have to go home.

705
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:19,320
We decided to think over it
by our side.

706
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:21,840
As long as I don't want to,
I won't see him.

707
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:28,440
Today is New Year's Eve.

708
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:31,400
It's my problem.

709
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:37,480
But, Isaku never shows his mind.

710
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:40,560
It's difficult to know
what is on his mind.

711
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:41,960
Isn't it?

712
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:43,800
That is what everybody thinks.

713
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:47,240
I feel like fighting windmills.

714
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:50,080
I have enough.

715
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:54,760
Mokichi. Once you get married,
be careful

716
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:57,480
or your wife well go back to her
parents complaining.

717
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:01,840
Don't worry.
Namiko is not like this.

718
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,240
One time: 10 yens.

719
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:08,560
It's true, today you didn't
pronounce her name yet.

720
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:09,600
If Namiko were here...

721
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:11,160
One more time: 20 yens

722
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:18,800
Mokichi, you know women...

723
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:22,520
They show their true nature
5 or 6 years after the wedding.

724
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:24,560
- All of them?
- Yes.

725
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:29,520
When it will hit you,
it will be terrible.

726
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:30,480
Yes, probably.

727
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:42,800
It's cooked.

728
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:58,280
Your wife is late.

729
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:02,960
Tonight, the train is working all night.

730
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:07,200
But, don't you feel worry
about her?

731
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:09,120
It's almost midnight.

732
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:15,520
And you? You stay here
for new year's holidays?

733
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:17,280
Yes, I'm not interested in family.

734
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:19,400
You're not visiting
your wife's grave?

735
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:21,520
I just went there,

736
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:23,400
but it was for the funeral.

737
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:24,480
Doesn't matter.

738
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:26,440
Your wife is really late.

739
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:30,040
She left since this morning.
It doesn't bother you?

740
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:31,280
What?

741
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:32,680
That your wife is not here?

742
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:38,000
Good evening.

743
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:46,720
You grilled the rice cake?

744
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:49,120
We were hungry.

745
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:52,480
You shouldn't cook
fresh rice cakes.

746
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:53,320
Really?

747
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:57,400
There was many customers
by my parents.

748
01:10:57,880 --> 01:10:59,560
They are very busy today.

749
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:02,000
My mother gave me that.

750
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:04,200
It's very good.

751
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:06,240
Here you are. Try it.

752
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:13,960
It's very good.

753
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,440
It is midnight

754
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:27,000
Everything is ready for
the new year.

755
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:30,440
A new year.

756
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:36,280
I am going to sleep. Good night.

757
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,560
- Do you want some tea?
- No, thanks.

758
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:43,400
Is it cold outside?

759
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:44,600
Warm yourself up.

760
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:46,640
I was late.

761
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:53,000
What's the matter?

762
01:11:57,720 --> 01:12:00,280
<i>"To signal the new year,</i>

763
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:03,120
<i>you are listening to the bell
of the Ishakuji temple,</i>

764
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:05,400
<i>in the Yamagata prefecture"</i>

765
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:48,360
You just got married, so I
don't want to scare you,

766
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:54,200
but you must be careful
during the early days.

767
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:56,240
Don't be too nice nor too obedient,

768
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:58,200
or she might become pretentious.

769
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:04,240
Men, Namiko, are happy if you
flatter them.

770
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:07,920
If you look at them as big children,
you'll be fine.

771
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:09,960
You shouldn't forget that.

772
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:14,840
Everything is fine, if you
know how to cradle them like babies.

773
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:19,800
It's difficult.

774
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:23,560
Yes, a couple are like scissors.

775
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:26,200
Who said that? Koda Rohan?
Yes, that must be.

776
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:29,320
Or maybe Ogai Mori.

777
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:31,960
Whoever. He said that.

778
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,080
In a couple, nobody can
cut the sheet alone.

779
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:38,520
It's like scissors, two knives
cutting together.

780
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:41,200
Is it true?

781
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:43,320
It's true.

782
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:44,960
Well said.

783
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:50,000
What's not normal is when the
husband is working hard,

784
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:53,960
and the woman let him wear
old worn coat.

785
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,520
Or when the husband comes
home late and tired,

786
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:00,240
and his wife hasn't
made the bath ready.

787
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:04,880
Moreover, even if the fire
has put out,

788
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:09,120
but she foolishly claims
the bath should be ready soon.

789
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:10,520
Of course.

790
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:15,400
Men think that they alone

791
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:19,640
can be tired at night, which is wrong.

792
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:22,000
For me, that shouldn't be
an issue, as I'm working at home.

793
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:26,080
Moreover, if I'm going out
I'll take you with me.

794
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Don't worry then.

795
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:35,040
- We should go now.
- Already?

796
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:38,120
Are you still looking for a house?

797
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:42,480
Namiko... A relative of my wife...

798
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:45,360
does she have something to rent?

799
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:49,400
Yes, under the condition there
is no children.

800
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:52,080
Where is it located? We are interested.

801
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:17,840
It's very quiet.

802
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:21,560
- Here it is.
- Really?

803
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:37,360
Good day.

804
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:46,680
I'm a relative of Mr. Mishima
who rented a room in this house.

805
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:51,000
You are a relative of
Mr. Mishima?

806
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:53,240
How do you do?

807
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:56,600
Do you still have a room to let?

808
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:58,560
Upstairs? Yes.

809
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:03,080
Let me introduce you
my sister-in-law.

810
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:04,520
How do you do?

811
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:08,400
The room upstairs is very quiet.

812
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:10,520
We had many applicant,

813
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:13,040
but it can't be rented
to anybody.

814
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:17,480
Good day.

815
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:25,520
Downstair, we have two students.

816
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:28,160
And this lady rents one
of the room upstairs.

817
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:31,920
She teaches tea ceremony
and ikebana.

818
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:34,280
We don't accept couples...

819
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:37,400
with children, it's too noisy.

820
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:40,280
It's perfect for you.

821
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:42,120
What about the deposit?

822
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:43,840
There is no deposit.

823
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:48,320
But when someone

824
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:52,360
brings a gift as a token
of good understanding,

825
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:55,440
then I accept it.

826
01:16:56,160 --> 01:16:58,040
Is it for you and
your husband?

827
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:01,640
Just the two of us.

828
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:05,040
- Are you going out?
- Yes.

829
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:09,640
- Do you wish to see the room?
- Yes, please.

830
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:39,040
Good day.

831
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:45,240
Mr. and Mrs. Nakahara
already moved out?

832
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:48,080
Yes, earlier today.

833
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:49,320
What do you want?

834
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:53,320
Yesterday, the boss left
a message for you,

835
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:56,560
but you didn't come back.

836
01:17:58,120 --> 01:17:58,960
Then I...

837
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:01,240
As today is Sunday,

838
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:03,320
I took the opportunity
to pass it to you.

839
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:05,800
What is it?

840
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:10,320
The managing director will visit
the office tomorrow at 9:00.

841
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:12,240
The boss wants you to come
early that day.

842
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:14,480
Really? 9:00?

843
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:23,280
Do you want to come in?

844
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:26,640
- It doesn't bother you?
- No.

845
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:50,080
Excuse me.

846
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:02,520
Excuse me.

847
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:40,480
Could you move that cupboard
over there?

848
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:41,920
Again?

849
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:03,720
Why are out of breath?

850
01:20:05,320 --> 01:20:07,320
Since the morning we went
up and down the stairs so many times.

851
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:20,560
Is she the Ikebana teacher?

852
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:21,760
She could hear you.

853
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:29,280
It's quiet.

854
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:32,440
But, here, it's only short time.

855
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:34,000
Why?

856
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:36,760
If we have children...

857
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:39,000
Don't worry.

858
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:44,800
Maybe, there is something.

859
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:51,920
If it's right, it's nice.

860
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:53,480
I confirm!

861
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:04,960
Why didn't you tell
if you knew it?

862
01:21:07,160 --> 01:21:07,720
Because...

863
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:22,160
What could we do?

864
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:25,920
We had to move out.

865
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:28,760
We still have another 6 months.

866
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:32,960
It will be alright, we'll look
for some other place.

867
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:35,320
But I don't have any
money left for that.

868
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:37,440
I'll ask my father.

869
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:38,960
No way.

870
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:41,280
We can't give him back.

871
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:43,120
I don't want to.

872
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:45,920
You should stop always counting
on your parents.

873
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:49,040
You know that your family
is not that rich.

874
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:52,480
I'll look for a job at home.

875
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:01,120
In that case, we should get rid
of the baby.

876
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:08,600
It's not the right time.

877
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:11,760
No.

878
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:17,360
- But..
- No.

879
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:06,400
Come on, let's go.

880
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:12,280
You shouldn't feel guilty.

881
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:14,120
It won't last long.

882
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:44,560
<i>"Obstetrician"</i>

883
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:02,480
It should be all right.

884
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:21,600
Let's go.

885
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:25,360
Let's go back.
