00:00:28,285 --> 00:00:31,055
Albuquerque police.
Open the door, please.

3
00:00:32,823 --> 00:00:35,190
Dad, wake up, wake up.
Wake up!

4
00:00:38,128 --> 00:00:39,861
Albuquerque police, open up.

5
00:00:39,863 --> 00:00:42,600
Fuck.

6
00:00:43,567 --> 00:00:46,267
All right, we gotta go.
All right.

7
00:00:46,269 --> 00:00:49,004
Get your shoes on.

8
00:00:49,006 --> 00:00:52,708
Open up.

9
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,043
Piece of shit knocks me around,
then steals my Chanel purse?

10
00:00:55,045 --> 00:00:56,477
That was real fucking Chanel!

11
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:57,846
I have some Chanel loafers
that I love,

12
00:00:57,848 --> 00:00:59,281
so I totally get it.

13
00:00:59,283 --> 00:01:00,985
Open up, please, right now.

14
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,654
- Why am I doing this?
- Stop asking questions.

15
00:01:05,656 --> 00:01:07,822
That's good. That's good.

16
00:01:15,966 --> 00:01:18,467
- Oh, goddamn it.
- What's happening?

17
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:20,237
Oh. Goddamn it.

18
00:01:21,104 --> 00:01:22,637
Inside the cover of that Bible,

19
00:01:22,639 --> 00:01:23,938
there's an address in Santa Fe.

20
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,441
- Get in a cab and go there.
- No!

21
00:01:26,443 --> 00:01:28,843
Listen, it's better than
Child Protective Services.

22
00:01:28,845 --> 00:01:30,979
You gotta trust me on that one.

23
00:01:30,981 --> 00:01:32,681
All right, hey, look at me.

24
00:01:32,683 --> 00:01:34,748
I know I'm not the best dad
in the world,

25
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,287
all right, but I love you.

26
00:01:39,824 --> 00:01:41,322
Goddamn it.

27
00:01:41,324 --> 00:01:42,857
Hey!

28
00:01:42,859 --> 00:01:43,925
What the hell was that for?

29
00:01:43,927 --> 00:01:45,893
You fucked everything up!

30
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,107
Get down on the ground!
Down on the ground!

31
00:01:59,109 --> 00:02:01,009
I'm not resisting!
I'm not resisting!

32
00:02:32,776 --> 00:02:36,510
Oh, hello!
And good morning.

33
00:02:36,512 --> 00:02:39,579
Have you never been invited
to a ranchero breakfast?

34
00:02:39,581 --> 00:02:43,418
Well, my friends, on this
glorious day, you are in luck.

35
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,453
- Because we...
- Are you okay?

36
00:02:45,455 --> 00:02:46,520
You're leaning.

37
00:02:46,522 --> 00:02:47,923
It's a Western saddle.

38
00:02:47,925 --> 00:02:49,623
I can't sit forward
like the English.

39
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:52,727
Cowboys sit back on their
haunches up against the cantle.

40
00:02:52,729 --> 00:02:54,329
Oh! Ugh!

41
00:02:54,331 --> 00:02:55,933
Oh, God.

42
00:03:00,403 --> 00:03:02,503
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I think so.

43
00:03:02,505 --> 00:03:05,240
You know, we don't have to do
the scene on horseback.

44
00:03:05,242 --> 00:03:07,341
I want to.
It's... it's important.

45
00:03:07,343 --> 00:03:09,978
It adds to the masculinity.
It adds to the grandeur.

46
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,746
Well, that's true.

47
00:03:11,748 --> 00:03:13,215
- Are you being facetious?
- Mm-hmm.

48
00:03:13,217 --> 00:03:15,584
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

49
00:03:15,586 --> 00:03:16,785
Thank you so much.

50
00:03:16,787 --> 00:03:19,821
You are a gentleman.
You really are.

51
00:03:19,823 --> 00:03:22,557
God knows they're in short
supply around here.

52
00:03:22,559 --> 00:03:23,891
Oh, my God.

53
00:03:23,893 --> 00:03:25,492
Would you quit flirting
with him?

54
00:03:25,494 --> 00:03:27,395
It makes him feel awkward,
and he's straight.

55
00:03:27,397 --> 00:03:30,733
No, it makes you feel awkward,
and he's gay.

56
00:03:30,735 --> 00:03:32,266
Well, it makes everyone
feel awkward

57
00:03:32,268 --> 00:03:34,836
watching you act
like a weird old woman.

58
00:03:34,838 --> 00:03:37,104
No, <i>you're</i> a weird
old woman.

59
00:03:37,106 --> 00:03:38,906
You want
to know something?

60
00:03:38,908 --> 00:03:43,079
I could've worked for
Rachel Ray, and she's nice.

61
00:03:45,381 --> 00:03:47,948
How about we just take it
from the first line?

62
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,450
I'd be delighted.

63
00:03:49,452 --> 00:03:51,453
All right,
everyone back to one.

64
00:03:59,595 --> 00:04:01,297
Step aside, son.

65
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:32,460
This is a Basque oven paddle

66
00:04:32,462 --> 00:04:35,297
that I have repurposed
as a tapas tray.

67
00:04:35,299 --> 00:04:37,866
I like to serve
my stuffed paquillo peppers

68
00:04:37,868 --> 00:04:39,734
on the back of a horse.

69
00:04:39,736 --> 00:04:45,205
Mind you, a vaquero breakfast
needn't be on a vast rancho.

70
00:04:45,207 --> 00:04:47,409
When we return,
I'll show you how you can cook

71
00:04:47,411 --> 00:04:51,780
some of this gorgeous food
in your own little kitchen.

72
00:04:51,782 --> 00:04:53,047
Ciao.

73
00:04:53,049 --> 00:04:55,116
Dig in, amigos.

74
00:04:55,118 --> 00:04:57,451
Manny, you old cock hound.
I didn't see you there.

75
00:04:57,453 --> 00:05:00,487
You can't say "cock hound"
on basic cable.

76
00:05:00,489 --> 00:05:01,925
Cut.

77
00:05:02,825 --> 00:05:06,160
Get rid of
the terra-cotta pots. Yuck.

78
00:05:06,162 --> 00:05:08,328
Ditto the galvanized tin.

79
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:12,333
Please, please remove the ghastly
bandannas from the goblets.

80
00:05:12,335 --> 00:05:16,672
You, young man, put your camera
there pointing that way.

81
00:05:16,674 --> 00:05:18,039
Look at him.

82
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:19,907
He's like
the gay Butch Cassidy

83
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:21,609
except not Butch.

84
00:05:21,611 --> 00:05:25,547
If only we had a producer
who understood that objects

85
00:05:25,549 --> 00:05:27,049
exist in a space.

86
00:05:27,051 --> 00:05:28,282
Wouldn't that be wonderful?

87
00:05:28,284 --> 00:05:29,885
If only you came
to production meetings

88
00:05:29,887 --> 00:05:31,753
to communicate
your ideas in advance.

89
00:05:31,755 --> 00:05:34,321
Oh, but that would cut
into your rigorous drinking

90
00:05:34,323 --> 00:05:36,023
and masturbation schedule.

91
00:05:37,126 --> 00:05:38,760
Do you guys do this at home?

92
00:05:38,762 --> 00:05:41,899
Oh, no, we don't get along
this well at home.

93
00:05:42,832 --> 00:05:44,698
Why don't you leave him?

94
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,267
I probably will.

95
00:05:46,269 --> 00:05:47,669
But, you know,
part of me wants

96
00:05:47,671 --> 00:05:49,837
to stick around
just to watch him die.

97
00:06:02,852 --> 00:06:05,886
Oh, can we call a truce?

98
00:06:05,888 --> 00:06:07,321
Yes.

99
00:06:07,323 --> 00:06:08,623
Thank you.

100
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:10,325
Finally.

101
00:06:10,327 --> 00:06:11,525
Finally?

102
00:06:11,527 --> 00:06:14,128
When have you ever
called for a truce?

103
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:17,232
You realize you're starting
an argument about a truce.

104
00:06:17,234 --> 00:06:21,936
I think you are manipulative
and passive-aggressive,

105
00:06:21,938 --> 00:06:23,304
and the truce starts now.

106
00:06:23,306 --> 00:06:29,112
Ah! My favorite Mexicans.
<i>Me llamo Mexico.</i>

107
00:06:45,794 --> 00:06:48,395
So we just got back
from Machu Picchu,

108
00:06:48,397 --> 00:06:50,765
and there's nothing there.
Not impressed. Not impressed.

109
00:06:50,767 --> 00:06:52,267
It just looks like
the Flintstones village.

110
00:06:52,269 --> 00:06:53,835
I'm like, "This is it?
This is it?"

111
00:06:53,837 --> 00:06:56,169
- Not impressed. Zero stars.
- What do you like?

112
00:06:56,171 --> 00:06:58,106
I like Epcot.

113
00:06:58,108 --> 00:07:01,075
Bobby Flay,
I like him as a person.

114
00:07:01,077 --> 00:07:02,410
You know he's
one of my best friends.

115
00:07:02,412 --> 00:07:04,611
No, no,
no don't get me wrong.

116
00:07:04,613 --> 00:07:06,347
He's got a wonderful face

117
00:07:06,349 --> 00:07:10,251
- and, you know...
- marvelous chutzpah.

118
00:07:10,253 --> 00:07:12,520
Are you from LA?

119
00:07:12,522 --> 00:07:13,688
I'm the mayor.

120
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:14,821
Wait, what?

121
00:07:14,823 --> 00:07:18,126
- Of Santa Fe.
- Oh, I love that.

122
00:07:18,128 --> 00:07:20,695
This close
to the border of Syria.

123
00:07:20,697 --> 00:07:22,028
You can hear the gunfire.

124
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:24,366
You hear people screaming.
Terrifying.

125
00:07:24,368 --> 00:07:27,268
But the za'atar chicken

126
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,770
was the best I've ever had.

127
00:07:28,772 --> 00:07:30,804
- Mouthwatering.
- And the screaming children

128
00:07:30,806 --> 00:07:32,174
didn't bother
the food at all?

129
00:07:32,176 --> 00:07:35,008
- Apples and oranges.
- You got to eat.

130
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,109
It's the city of holy faith...

131
00:07:36,111 --> 00:07:37,611
- Oh.
- Santa Fe.

132
00:07:37,613 --> 00:07:40,616
That's so cool.
I love that.

133
00:07:42,152 --> 00:07:43,585
And I'm like, "Hey, asshole,

134
00:07:43,587 --> 00:07:46,087
the fucking Dalai Lama
gave me that purse."

135
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:52,027
Ladies and gentlemen,
please join me in a toast

136
00:07:52,029 --> 00:07:55,196
to two of the finest
hosts in Santa Fe.

137
00:07:55,198 --> 00:07:57,698
What am I talking about?
The world.

138
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,133
Paul, Erasmus.

139
00:07:59,135 --> 00:08:01,369
And if I may interrupt there,
Mr. Mayor,

140
00:08:01,371 --> 00:08:03,772
let's not forget
all the little people,

141
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:06,407
all the worker bees
out there whoever they are.

142
00:08:06,409 --> 00:08:08,910
- The little people.
- Hear, hear.

143
00:08:08,912 --> 00:08:10,344
Well put.

144
00:08:10,346 --> 00:08:13,481
I am with such an asshole.

145
00:08:13,483 --> 00:08:15,982
I love an asshole.
So to speak.

146
00:08:17,921 --> 00:08:19,119
Cheers to that.

147
00:08:19,121 --> 00:08:20,621
- Cheers to that!
- Double cheers!

148
00:09:00,328 --> 00:09:03,130
I mean, it is Santa Fe, right?
It's a little on the nose.

149
00:09:03,132 --> 00:09:05,532
I just get sick
of all the turquoise.

150
00:09:05,534 --> 00:09:07,100
It gets a little over...
I mean, no disrespect.

151
00:09:07,102 --> 00:09:08,603
- You look great.
- Thanks.

152
00:09:08,605 --> 00:09:11,540
Yeah.
Oh, hello, who are you?

153
00:09:11,542 --> 00:09:13,177
Um...

154
00:09:16,112 --> 00:09:19,582
Oh. Erasmus.

155
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:23,151
Well, someone can't spell
my name.

156
00:09:23,153 --> 00:09:27,124
"Dear Arosmus.
This is your grandson."

157
00:09:29,292 --> 00:09:32,659
Is... Is your father here?

158
00:09:32,661 --> 00:09:35,330
Was he here?
Has he gone? Wh...?

159
00:09:35,332 --> 00:09:39,736
What's your name?
Um, do you have a name?

160
00:09:42,438 --> 00:09:44,638
Um, can we get
another chair, please?

161
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,173
Please.

162
00:09:47,175 --> 00:09:49,378
Is that all you have
with you?

163
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,150
Well, we've got a Bible.

164
00:09:55,084 --> 00:10:00,388
Some cash.
And a bag of cocaine.

165
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,556
Hmm.

166
00:10:01,558 --> 00:10:02,923
All anyone really
needs in life, eh?

167
00:10:02,925 --> 00:10:05,893
No clothes, I see.

168
00:10:05,895 --> 00:10:08,662
I'll call the store.
They're about to close.

169
00:10:08,664 --> 00:10:11,235
Oh. Oh, good.

170
00:10:14,102 --> 00:10:16,171
Um, everyone,
it would appear

171
00:10:16,173 --> 00:10:19,543
this little chap
is my grandson.

172
00:10:22,145 --> 00:10:24,579
The truth is,
Sandy Koufax had a huge dong.

173
00:10:24,581 --> 00:10:26,580
- Really?
- Huge dong. Legendary.

174
00:10:26,582 --> 00:10:28,983
- Legendarily huge dong.
- Is that true?

175
00:10:28,985 --> 00:10:30,585
That is true. For a Jew.

176
00:10:30,587 --> 00:10:31,788
Excuse me.

177
00:10:32,789 --> 00:10:34,888
You have a grandson?

178
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:36,391
It's unbelievable, isn't it?

179
00:10:36,393 --> 00:10:40,295
I mean, look.
I've had no work done.

180
00:10:40,297 --> 00:10:42,396
I only found out you had
a son a few years ago.

181
00:10:42,398 --> 00:10:44,831
He's estranged.
I told you about him.

182
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:46,234
No, not really.

183
00:10:46,236 --> 00:10:49,003
Well, back in the '80s
when I was experimenting,

184
00:10:49,005 --> 00:10:54,642
I had a liaison with a woman
which resulted in a baby...

185
00:10:54,644 --> 00:10:57,411
yuck...
which she wanted to keep.

186
00:10:57,413 --> 00:11:00,348
And... This is
all very murky.

187
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:02,249
I was probably off my tits
on Quaaludes.

188
00:11:02,251 --> 00:11:05,485
Remember them?
What a blast.

189
00:11:05,487 --> 00:11:10,490
Anywho, before you came along,
darling, I had a son called Bo

190
00:11:10,492 --> 00:11:12,860
who dropped out of school,
developed a drug problem.

191
00:11:12,862 --> 00:11:15,763
He even OD'ed at my book launch
in New York.

192
00:11:15,765 --> 00:11:17,831
No. How embarrassing
for you.

193
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:20,167
Well, it was.
Anna Wintour was there.

194
00:11:20,169 --> 00:11:21,835
Wait.
Where's the father?

195
00:11:21,837 --> 00:11:24,339
According to the note,
he's in jail.

196
00:11:24,341 --> 00:11:25,706
Yes, he's in jail.

197
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:30,043
- So he's moving in?
- Just keep an eye on him.

198
00:11:30,045 --> 00:11:31,579
We can't have a kid.

199
00:11:31,581 --> 00:11:33,013
We couldn't even handle
that little rat bastard

200
00:11:33,015 --> 00:11:34,114
Yorkshire Terrier.

201
00:11:34,116 --> 00:11:35,483
Thank God for that coyote.

202
00:11:35,485 --> 00:11:37,018
Problem solved,
but a kid's too much.

203
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,553
Calm down, I'm sure someone
from Social Services

204
00:11:39,555 --> 00:11:41,489
will turn up on the doorstep
and tell us where we stand.

205
00:11:41,491 --> 00:11:42,824
Just take one of your pills.

206
00:11:42,826 --> 00:11:44,291
Why don't you take
one of your pills?

207
00:11:44,293 --> 00:11:45,627
That reminds me.

208
00:11:45,629 --> 00:11:47,128
What are we going
to do about this?

209
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:49,129
I mean,
I don't do cocaine anymore,

210
00:11:49,131 --> 00:11:50,931
but it seems such
a dreadful waste.

211
00:11:50,933 --> 00:11:53,433
We could put it in one
of Tatyana's charity auctions.

212
00:11:53,435 --> 00:11:55,201
- Perfect.
- I'm kidding.

213
00:11:55,203 --> 00:11:57,172
We'd go to jail.

214
00:11:57,174 --> 00:12:00,309
Oh.
Do you want a blow job?

215
00:12:02,411 --> 00:12:06,413
- We have guests.
- Yes, you're right.

216
00:12:06,415 --> 00:12:08,550
Have a good night, guys.
Thanks so much.

217
00:12:08,552 --> 00:12:12,586
Hey. So people are going
so you can deal with the kid.

218
00:12:12,588 --> 00:12:13,988
No. Don't go, Kate.

219
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:16,356
No. I have a bleaching
in the morning.

220
00:12:16,358 --> 00:12:17,660
For my teeth.

221
00:12:19,629 --> 00:12:21,995
Everyone is leaving.

222
00:12:21,997 --> 00:12:24,565
This is the worst thing
that's ever happened to me.

223
00:12:24,567 --> 00:12:26,066
Just tell us
what you want,

224
00:12:26,068 --> 00:12:27,569
and someone will make it
for you.

225
00:12:27,571 --> 00:12:29,036
I want Taco Bell.

226
00:12:29,038 --> 00:12:30,970
Let's just go to the kitchen.
Maybe we can...

227
00:12:30,972 --> 00:12:32,340
Don't touch me!

228
00:12:32,342 --> 00:12:33,740
It's all right.
It's okay.

229
00:12:33,742 --> 00:12:36,511
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

230
00:12:36,513 --> 00:12:38,879
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

231
00:12:38,881 --> 00:12:40,782
Okay, would you
nut up for second?

232
00:12:40,784 --> 00:12:42,550
Here's what
you're going to do.

233
00:12:42,552 --> 00:12:44,252
You're going to get
the mayor a shot of mescal.

234
00:12:44,254 --> 00:12:45,952
You're going to ask the editor
of <i>El Decor</i> to dance.

235
00:12:45,954 --> 00:12:47,754
I'm going to tell Gustavo
to play some tangos

236
00:12:47,756 --> 00:12:50,425
and get Tino to take
that feral child the Taco Bell.

237
00:12:50,427 --> 00:12:52,060
Then you're going to go
to the front door,

238
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:53,360
tell everybody to come back

239
00:12:53,362 --> 00:12:54,762
because you got me
a birthday cake,

240
00:12:54,764 --> 00:12:56,464
we're going to sing,
and there's cocaine.

241
00:12:56,466 --> 00:12:59,403
Yes, but I haven't,
and it's not your birthday.

242
00:13:00,535 --> 00:13:02,836
It is your birthday.

243
00:13:02,838 --> 00:13:04,971
Go. Go. Go.

244
00:13:04,973 --> 00:13:06,141
Hey, everyone!

245
00:13:06,143 --> 00:13:08,643
I've got cocaine
and birthday cake!

246
00:13:35,038 --> 00:13:38,773
Well, this would be
the point where you say,

247
00:13:38,775 --> 00:13:42,310
"Erasmus, it's <i>marvelous!"</i>

248
00:13:42,312 --> 00:13:45,916
It's like staying
at a five-star resort!

249
00:13:47,016 --> 00:13:49,550
I look like
a fucking asshole in these.

250
00:13:49,552 --> 00:13:52,320
All right, come on.

251
00:13:52,322 --> 00:13:54,725
Bedtime. Let's go.

252
00:13:59,696 --> 00:14:01,528
Lights on or off?

253
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:03,397
I don't care.

254
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:05,099
Hey, hey...

255
00:14:05,101 --> 00:14:06,367
Never say that.

256
00:14:06,369 --> 00:14:08,002
You should always
care passionately

257
00:14:08,004 --> 00:14:11,942
about every single choice
you make in your life.

258
00:14:15,845 --> 00:14:17,581
Good night.

259
00:14:19,348 --> 00:14:20,681
We're locking our doors.

260
00:14:20,683 --> 00:14:22,917
That kid scares
the shit out of me.

261
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:25,387
- Oh, I think he's sweet.
- Really?

262
00:14:25,389 --> 00:14:26,921
Well, people thought
Jeffrey Dahmer was sweet

263
00:14:26,923 --> 00:14:28,989
till he raped them
and ate them.

264
00:14:28,991 --> 00:14:30,758
Ew.

265
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,561
I'm sure it's just
a temporary arrangement.

266
00:14:33,563 --> 00:14:35,562
What if it's not?

267
00:14:35,564 --> 00:14:40,468
Well, would that be
such a bad thing?

268
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:43,604
My parents were
such drunkaholic messes.

269
00:14:43,606 --> 00:14:45,940
I was 11 years old before
I realized my father's name

270
00:14:45,942 --> 00:14:47,974
wasn't
"that fucking bastard."

271
00:14:47,976 --> 00:14:51,678
Heh. You told me
that joke before.

272
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,449
I'm so sorry. I'll try
and work on some new material.

273
00:14:55,451 --> 00:14:57,551
Thank you.

274
00:14:57,553 --> 00:14:58,985
They were terrible parents,

275
00:14:58,987 --> 00:15:00,687
and I don't want
to be a terrible parent.

276
00:15:00,689 --> 00:15:05,158
- No one's asking you to be.
- Oh, God.

277
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,228
I feel like I'm going to have
one of my things.

278
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:09,663
- What things?
- My panic things.

279
00:15:09,665 --> 00:15:13,868
I shouldn't have done blow.
I'm such a douchebag.

280
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:17,338
- Well, take one of your pills.
- I did.

281
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:21,008
You know, the editor
of El Decor was dancing

282
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:22,575
like her
life depended on it.

283
00:15:22,577 --> 00:15:23,945
If she'd gone home early,

284
00:15:23,947 --> 00:15:25,613
the party would've been
a disaster.

285
00:15:25,615 --> 00:15:28,181
We should check in,
make sure everything's okay.

286
00:15:28,183 --> 00:15:30,183
What, with the editor?

287
00:15:30,185 --> 00:15:31,451
Hmm? No, the kid.

288
00:15:31,453 --> 00:15:33,421
Oh, he'll be fast asleep.

289
00:15:33,423 --> 00:15:34,755
We should check in,

290
00:15:34,757 --> 00:15:37,092
make sure
he hasn't stolen anything.

291
00:15:41,664 --> 00:15:43,500
What the hell?

292
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,941
Hey, kid?
What's his name again?

293
00:15:53,943 --> 00:15:56,844
I told you a dozen times,
I don't know.

294
00:15:56,846 --> 00:15:59,816
Kid! K...

295
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,683
Should I call the police?

296
00:16:02,685 --> 00:16:05,719
No, it's okay,
they're all here. They're safe.

297
00:16:05,721 --> 00:16:08,723
No, not because of your
kachina doll collection.

298
00:16:08,725 --> 00:16:13,597
- Because the kid is missing.
- Oh. Paul.

299
00:16:16,499 --> 00:16:18,666
Maybe one of us
should take the car into town

300
00:16:18,668 --> 00:16:20,801
- and have a look around.
- Meaning me?

301
00:16:20,803 --> 00:16:23,671
Well, one of us
has got to stay here.

302
00:16:23,673 --> 00:16:25,241
Meaning you?

303
00:16:33,249 --> 00:16:35,185
Erasmus.

304
00:16:40,689 --> 00:16:42,989
Thank God.

305
00:16:42,991 --> 00:16:46,228
I need a drink.
Oh, God.

306
00:16:52,034 --> 00:16:54,369
Hey.

307
00:16:54,371 --> 00:16:55,569
Hey, hey.

308
00:16:55,571 --> 00:16:57,671
It's okay.

309
00:16:57,673 --> 00:17:00,206
You gave us a scare, kid.

310
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:02,678
Get away from me, you fag.

311
00:17:10,486 --> 00:17:12,019
So what'd the lawyer say?

312
00:17:12,021 --> 00:17:14,355
Nothing, really, just that
the father is in custody,

313
00:17:14,357 --> 00:17:16,256
the mother is dead,
and they're gonna send

314
00:17:16,258 --> 00:17:17,992
someone round
from Social Services.

315
00:17:17,994 --> 00:17:20,861
We can't have a kid.
We don't like kids.

316
00:17:20,863 --> 00:17:23,731
Stop calling him a kid.
He's a child. A kid a baby goat.

317
00:17:23,733 --> 00:17:25,899
I'd rather have a baby goat.
Baby goats are cute.

318
00:17:25,901 --> 00:17:29,639
Baby goats won't come and visit
you when you're old and lonely.

319
00:17:30,739 --> 00:17:32,639
Besides, didn't you organize
that Mexican

320
00:17:32,641 --> 00:17:34,140
children charity
or something?

321
00:17:34,142 --> 00:17:36,610
Look, I love helping
children in the abstract,

322
00:17:36,612 --> 00:17:38,878
but I don't want one
in the house.

323
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,214
Hmm.

324
00:17:40,216 --> 00:17:41,948
Well, at any rate, we have
to send it to school.

325
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,817
- Really?
- Yeah, it's the law.

326
00:17:43,819 --> 00:17:47,253
And it gets him out
of the house for the day.

327
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:06,607
Hello.

328
00:18:06,609 --> 00:18:08,007
Oh, hello.

329
00:18:08,009 --> 00:18:10,244
We would like to enroll
this young man.

330
00:18:10,246 --> 00:18:14,817
All right.
And what is his name?

331
00:18:22,492 --> 00:18:24,694
Would you excuse us,
please?

332
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:35,936
Oh, I see you've discovered
one of my favorite contraptions.

333
00:18:35,938 --> 00:18:40,507
These are such fun.
Let's have a look.

334
00:18:40,509 --> 00:18:44,678
Hmm. You might want to vary
your expression a bit.

335
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:48,651
Scoot along.
Join in with me if you like.

336
00:18:49,884 --> 00:18:52,552
I like to do one happy...

337
00:18:52,554 --> 00:18:54,888
one angry...

338
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:57,891
one silly...

339
00:18:57,893 --> 00:18:59,693
and one just looking off
into the middle distance,

340
00:18:59,695 --> 00:19:02,866
thinking
about something.

341
00:19:06,169 --> 00:19:08,838
Now we've got
a bit of an awkward wait.

342
00:19:11,907 --> 00:19:16,842
Oh, look at those.
We're hilarious.

343
00:19:16,844 --> 00:19:18,411
What would you like
to do now?

344
00:19:38,534 --> 00:19:40,402
Having a party?

345
00:19:41,536 --> 00:19:43,840
No.

346
00:20:28,217 --> 00:20:31,051
And where have <i>you</i> been?

347
00:20:31,053 --> 00:20:33,186
Ugh. In the editing room.

348
00:20:33,188 --> 00:20:34,888
Trying to make something viable

349
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:38,260
out of your insane
on-camera ramblings.

350
00:20:39,894 --> 00:20:45,698
Paul, do you know that
huge store called Way Mart

351
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,034
or Mall Mart,
something on Cirrillos?

352
00:20:48,036 --> 00:20:50,937
Yeah, of course. It's owned
by some crazy conservatives.

353
00:20:50,939 --> 00:20:52,105
You shouldn't shop there.

354
00:20:52,107 --> 00:20:54,808
I thought it was nirvana.

355
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:56,878
Everything was so inexpensive.

356
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,579
The effect was intoxicating.

357
00:20:58,581 --> 00:21:02,081
As intoxicating as that
giant tumbler of tequila?

358
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:05,988
Yes.
But in a different way.

359
00:21:07,122 --> 00:21:09,322
- He should be in bed.
- Why?

360
00:21:09,324 --> 00:21:11,826
Because it's 2:00
in the morning.

361
00:21:11,828 --> 00:21:13,226
He doesn't have school
in the morning.

362
00:21:13,228 --> 00:21:15,428
I know, because
we haven't enrolled him

363
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:17,997
because we don't know
his name.

364
00:21:17,999 --> 00:21:19,734
Have a tequila.

365
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:22,069
Oh. I'm so tired.

366
00:21:22,071 --> 00:21:25,606
Oh. I'm so tired.

367
00:21:31,346 --> 00:21:33,045
Hey, kid.

368
00:21:33,047 --> 00:21:35,715
I know you're having fun,
but it's very late.

369
00:21:35,717 --> 00:21:38,987
Why don't you turn off the TV?
Let's get you to bed.

370
00:21:40,622 --> 00:21:42,389
Thanks, buddy.

371
00:21:42,391 --> 00:21:44,193
Mañana, piranha.

372
00:21:49,631 --> 00:21:52,300
Are you mad at me?

373
00:21:52,302 --> 00:21:54,169
Paul?

374
00:22:00,442 --> 00:22:05,811
Getting a nightcap?

375
00:22:05,813 --> 00:22:08,117
Some tea.

376
00:22:13,022 --> 00:22:16,391
Did you see the photo
for the dust jacket?

377
00:22:18,861 --> 00:22:21,161
Yes, I did.

378
00:22:21,163 --> 00:22:23,198
What do you think?

379
00:22:25,567 --> 00:22:27,201
This is why you need me.

380
00:22:27,203 --> 00:22:30,937
You really, really should have
let me look over these

381
00:22:30,939 --> 00:22:32,671
before you chose the cover,

382
00:22:32,673 --> 00:22:39,112
because you look like
a person with a mental handicap.

383
00:22:39,114 --> 00:22:44,319
No creature smiles <i>this</i> hard
in all of nature.

384
00:22:46,854 --> 00:22:50,323
I do.
When you make me laugh.

385
00:22:50,325 --> 00:22:53,395
Oh.

386
00:22:54,196 --> 00:22:55,529
That was cruel.

387
00:22:57,265 --> 00:23:01,137
The kettle's boiling.
So to speak.

388
00:23:04,806 --> 00:23:07,476
Fuck the tea.

389
00:23:09,411 --> 00:23:10,543
Yay.

390
00:23:20,622 --> 00:23:21,888
Well, hello.

391
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:23,323
I assume the kid
got to you okay.

392
00:23:23,325 --> 00:23:26,292
Yes. Yes, he's here
with me now.

393
00:23:26,294 --> 00:23:27,661
You brought him here?

394
00:23:27,663 --> 00:23:29,396
Yes, of course.
He wants to see you.

395
00:23:29,398 --> 00:23:31,865
What, are you insane?
He can't see me like this.

396
00:23:31,867 --> 00:23:34,601
Don't be ridiculous.

397
00:23:34,603 --> 00:23:36,471
Want a Rolo?

398
00:23:40,676 --> 00:23:42,475
That's littering.

399
00:23:42,477 --> 00:23:43,642
So?

400
00:23:43,644 --> 00:23:46,746
So, we don't do that.

401
00:23:46,748 --> 00:23:48,083
Pick it up.

402
00:23:49,185 --> 00:23:51,187
Pick it up.

403
00:23:58,727 --> 00:24:01,428
Don't bring him back here. It's
gonna screw him up in the head.

404
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:03,664
Like every decision
you haven't made already

405
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:04,898
hasn't screwed him up.

406
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,266
Hey, I don't need any shit
from you.

407
00:24:06,268 --> 00:24:07,834
You're going to take it,
young man,

408
00:24:07,836 --> 00:24:09,637
because Paul and I
are looking after your child.

409
00:24:09,639 --> 00:24:13,205
- Who is Paul?
- Paul is my male companion,

410
00:24:13,207 --> 00:24:16,275
and he has been
for the last 10 years.

411
00:24:16,277 --> 00:24:17,944
You have the problem
with that?

412
00:24:17,946 --> 00:24:20,149
No.

413
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:23,082
Oh.
Well, anyway,

414
00:24:23,084 --> 00:24:24,317
we brought him here

415
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:26,219
so that
you could see each other

416
00:24:26,221 --> 00:24:27,821
and to reassure you
that he's being

417
00:24:27,823 --> 00:24:30,659
well taken care of
in your absence.

418
00:24:33,128 --> 00:24:34,927
You're welcome.

419
00:24:34,929 --> 00:24:37,398
What would I thank you for?

420
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,331
Where were you
when I was 10 years old?

421
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:40,634
I could've used you then.

422
00:24:40,636 --> 00:24:41,968
And now you come back here

423
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:43,637
with your scarf
around your neck and think

424
00:24:43,639 --> 00:24:44,704
you're saving the day?

425
00:24:44,706 --> 00:24:46,372
It's called kerchief.

426
00:24:46,374 --> 00:24:47,840
You're not the hero of me

427
00:24:47,842 --> 00:24:49,042
and my son's story, all right?

428
00:24:49,044 --> 00:24:51,380
You're a last resort.

429
00:24:52,313 --> 00:24:55,215
Wait. What's his name?

430
00:24:56,384 --> 00:24:57,584
I wrote it in the Bible.

431
00:24:57,586 --> 00:24:59,388
Wait. What?

432
00:25:05,861 --> 00:25:08,428
So, it turns out
the county

433
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:11,631
won't allow visits
from children today.

434
00:25:11,633 --> 00:25:13,132
But the lady out front
said that it was...

435
00:25:13,134 --> 00:25:16,403
Without
additional paperwork.

436
00:25:16,405 --> 00:25:19,142
Oh.

437
00:25:20,275 --> 00:25:22,576
I have a great idea.

438
00:25:22,578 --> 00:25:24,476
Why don't we go
to a video arcade

439
00:25:24,478 --> 00:25:27,380
- and then get some ice cream?
- Yeah.

440
00:25:27,382 --> 00:25:30,451
Or we could go to
the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum,

441
00:25:30,453 --> 00:25:33,289
and afterwards
have a nice salad.

442
00:25:34,823 --> 00:25:36,689
- Yes! Yes!
- Yes! Fuck you!

443
00:25:36,691 --> 00:25:39,193
- You saw that, didn't you?!
- Nice shot! Nice shot!

444
00:25:39,195 --> 00:25:42,696
Yes!

445
00:25:56,378 --> 00:25:58,779
Excuse me... sweetheart.

446
00:25:58,781 --> 00:26:02,349
We don't fold throws.
It's too fussy.

447
00:26:02,351 --> 00:26:03,849
We want it be more casual,

448
00:26:03,851 --> 00:26:08,155
so we drape it
like a woman reclining, thus.

449
00:26:08,157 --> 00:26:09,723
Yes, you mustn't make it
seem as if you put

450
00:26:09,725 --> 00:26:11,724
- too much thought into it.
- Exactly so.

451
00:26:11,726 --> 00:26:13,927
It shouldn't look like
it's been placed there.

452
00:26:13,929 --> 00:26:15,596
- It should look like it's...
- Just appeared.

453
00:26:15,598 --> 00:26:17,230
- Yes, like a...
- Cyst.

454
00:26:17,232 --> 00:26:19,567
- ...rainbow or a...
- Cancer cell.

455
00:26:19,569 --> 00:26:21,501
Wildflower.

456
00:26:21,503 --> 00:26:24,070
- Perfect.
- That's wrong.

457
00:26:24,072 --> 00:26:27,209
Excuse us.
Uh. Excuse me.

458
00:26:28,176 --> 00:26:30,810
Look, the Bible.

459
00:26:30,812 --> 00:26:33,647
Hmm.

460
00:26:33,649 --> 00:26:35,349
From Bo, remember?
He said he left a note.

461
00:26:35,351 --> 00:26:37,951
Oh, yeah, sorry.
I thought you'd found God.

462
00:26:37,953 --> 00:26:41,754
Um, "It's Bo. Remember me?
This is grandson.

463
00:26:41,756 --> 00:26:45,591
"Mother is dead.
I got trouble/jail.

464
00:26:45,593 --> 00:26:48,328
Take care of him.
He's Angel."

465
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:51,197
He's really got something
against articles of speech.

466
00:26:51,199 --> 00:26:52,198
Angel...

467
00:26:56,205 --> 00:26:58,407
Is your name Angel?

468
00:27:01,275 --> 00:27:02,909
Why didn't you tell us?

469
00:27:05,813 --> 00:27:07,813
I don't like it.

470
00:27:07,815 --> 00:27:09,015
No one likes their name.

471
00:27:09,017 --> 00:27:10,317
No, can you imagine
how I felt

472
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:11,752
on my first day at school
when the teacher

473
00:27:11,754 --> 00:27:13,453
called out
a Erasmus Dickey Brumble?

474
00:27:13,455 --> 00:27:16,391
- What's wrong with Angel?
- It's gay.

475
00:27:17,258 --> 00:27:18,725
It is a little gay.

476
00:27:18,727 --> 00:27:20,627
What would you like
to be called?

477
00:27:20,629 --> 00:27:22,029
Bill.

478
00:27:22,031 --> 00:27:24,130
Then Bill you shall be.

479
00:27:24,132 --> 00:27:26,632
You can't just change his name
because he wants to change it.

480
00:27:26,634 --> 00:27:29,069
- Why not?
- Yeah, why not?

481
00:27:29,071 --> 00:27:32,973
All right, fine, Bill it is.
But one question.

482
00:27:32,975 --> 00:27:35,376
Why didn't you just tell us
you wanted to be called Bill

483
00:27:35,378 --> 00:27:36,510
from the outset?

484
00:27:36,512 --> 00:27:38,344
Because I just thought of it.

485
00:27:38,346 --> 00:27:40,580
I've been trying
to think of a name.

486
00:27:40,582 --> 00:27:42,049
What difference does it make?

487
00:27:42,051 --> 00:27:45,051
It makes a difference
because for two weeks,

488
00:27:45,053 --> 00:27:46,186
we've been calling him "kid"

489
00:27:46,188 --> 00:27:47,486
and we haven't
put him in school.

490
00:27:47,488 --> 00:27:50,256
No problem, just
from now on, communicate.

491
00:27:50,258 --> 00:27:51,791
Yeah, communicate.

492
00:27:51,793 --> 00:27:53,726
Don't, don't, don't, don't!

493
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:54,794
Don't do that!

494
00:27:54,796 --> 00:27:56,463
All the fucking time
you do that!

495
00:27:56,465 --> 00:27:58,165
You make me look like an idiot

496
00:27:58,167 --> 00:28:00,867
in front of the crew,
in front of the kid!

497
00:28:00,869 --> 00:28:03,535
The kid's got a name.
He's call...

498
00:28:03,537 --> 00:28:04,870
Sorry, what was your name?

499
00:28:04,872 --> 00:28:06,372
It's Bill!

500
00:28:06,374 --> 00:28:09,076
Uh, Paul?
Paul, wait, we need you.

501
00:28:12,547 --> 00:28:16,449
Well, can you make an exception
in my case?

502
00:28:16,451 --> 00:28:18,952
Perhaps it would make a
difference if I was to tell you

503
00:28:18,954 --> 00:28:22,388
my name was Erasmus Bumble.

504
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:25,926
I present to cookery program
and... Oh, sod it.

505
00:28:25,928 --> 00:28:29,599
Taco Bell don't deliver.
I can't get a hold of Paul.

506
00:28:30,865 --> 00:28:32,933
Hello, Paul, it's me.

507
00:28:32,935 --> 00:28:35,903
You made your point
quite eloquently.

508
00:28:35,905 --> 00:28:37,471
Please come home.

509
00:28:40,476 --> 00:28:46,045
I have made you cochinita pibil
with homemade tortilla.

510
00:28:46,047 --> 00:28:48,447
I've offered
to make you anything

511
00:28:48,449 --> 00:28:52,321
from the finest ingredients
known to man.

512
00:28:53,956 --> 00:28:55,888
Taco Bell.

513
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:58,826
Fine.

514
00:28:58,828 --> 00:29:00,426
All right.

515
00:29:00,428 --> 00:29:03,332
Total capitulation.

516
00:29:08,871 --> 00:29:10,372
Shit.

517
00:29:11,573 --> 00:29:14,474
This is raccoon.

518
00:29:14,476 --> 00:29:17,343
It's by the building
that's brown,

519
00:29:17,345 --> 00:29:18,611
and its square,

520
00:29:18,613 --> 00:29:20,747
and it has these
little logs on the roof.

521
00:29:20,749 --> 00:29:23,050
In case you hadn't noticed,

522
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:27,853
you just described every
fucking building in Santa Fe.

523
00:29:27,855 --> 00:29:28,921
Wait, there it is!

524
00:29:28,923 --> 00:29:31,459
Oh, great.

525
00:29:38,501 --> 00:29:41,100
<i>♪♪ I'm glad we made it
To Taco Bell ♪♪</i>

526
00:29:41,102 --> 00:29:43,305
Come on, come on, come on!

527
00:29:45,908 --> 00:29:48,308
Hi, welcome to Taco Bell.
My name's Leticia.

528
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,642
How can I help you?

529
00:29:49,644 --> 00:29:52,344
Hello, Leticia.
My name is Erasmus.

530
00:29:52,346 --> 00:29:54,981
And this is my grandson Bill.

531
00:29:54,983 --> 00:29:56,683
Can I have the Crunch Wrap
Supreme with bacon

532
00:29:56,685 --> 00:29:58,118
and the Nachos BellGrande?

533
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,785
Sure.

534
00:30:01,256 --> 00:30:04,157
And for you, sir?

535
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:06,559
I'm sorry,
I am mesmerized

536
00:30:06,561 --> 00:30:11,330
by the divergent culinary
concepts at play here.

537
00:30:11,332 --> 00:30:13,533
Cheesy Gordita Crunch.

538
00:30:13,535 --> 00:30:17,803
Fiery Doritos Locos
Tacos Supreme.

539
00:30:17,805 --> 00:30:20,541
I mean, it's like
Mexican jazz music.

540
00:30:20,543 --> 00:30:23,709
- Are you a Erasmus Brumble?
- I am indeed.

541
00:30:23,711 --> 00:30:25,278
I heard that you called earlier.

542
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,682
I love your books
and your TV show, and, well,

543
00:30:28,684 --> 00:30:30,417
what are you doing here?

544
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:32,552
Well, if you like my books
and my TV show,

545
00:30:32,554 --> 00:30:33,986
what are <i>you</i> doing here?

546
00:30:33,988 --> 00:30:36,823
Are you going
to order something?

547
00:30:36,825 --> 00:30:39,426
I'd love to see
the wine list first, please.

548
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:43,765
He wasn't joking.

549
00:30:48,269 --> 00:30:49,468
You like it?

550
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:53,240
Oh, Bill,
I've seen the light.

551
00:30:53,242 --> 00:30:54,741
What?

552
00:30:54,743 --> 00:30:56,776
Well, have a think.

553
00:30:56,778 --> 00:31:00,015
What's the happiest
you've ever been?

554
00:31:02,551 --> 00:31:05,385
One time with my dad,
he took me to the mountains,

555
00:31:05,387 --> 00:31:06,989
and we shot squirrels.

556
00:31:08,323 --> 00:31:10,991
Hmm.

557
00:31:10,993 --> 00:31:17,597
Well, for me, sitting here
sharing this taco with you,

558
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:19,769
is <i>that</i> good.

559
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:29,678
But there's got to be
a better table than this.

560
00:31:35,749 --> 00:31:38,820
How long have you been sitting
alone here in the dark?

561
00:31:39,653 --> 00:31:42,054
Uh... 10 years.

562
00:31:42,056 --> 00:31:44,858
It's been a nightmare
since you've been away.

563
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,826
Bill and I have been
crying our eyes out.

564
00:31:46,828 --> 00:31:50,128
- Isn't that right, Bill?
- No, it was fine.

565
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:51,598
We went to Taco Bell.

566
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,702
Why don't you trot off to bed,
little man?

567
00:31:57,805 --> 00:32:00,307
We can't have a kid.

568
00:32:00,309 --> 00:32:03,242
We are kids.

569
00:32:03,244 --> 00:32:04,778
Well, that's not true.

570
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:06,779
You're more of a kid
than me.

571
00:32:06,781 --> 00:32:08,782
Do I have a sense of play?

572
00:32:08,784 --> 00:32:11,118
Oh, uh, <i>yeah.</i>

573
00:32:13,421 --> 00:32:15,088
But you're a man.

574
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:19,458
You're a great big hulking
Paleolithic beast of a man.

575
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:22,128
You're talking about my ass.

576
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:23,629
No.

577
00:32:23,631 --> 00:32:25,831
Look at me.

578
00:32:25,833 --> 00:32:30,972
You have the biggest heart
of any man I know.

579
00:33:00,735 --> 00:33:02,871
Is everything all right?

580
00:33:07,342 --> 00:33:09,274
Yes, everything's fine.

581
00:33:09,276 --> 00:33:11,813
Can I have Chunky Monkey?

582
00:33:13,148 --> 00:33:15,150
Yes, of course.

583
00:33:16,317 --> 00:33:17,850
Where is it?

584
00:33:17,852 --> 00:33:20,086
It's in the freezer
in the kitchen.

585
00:33:20,088 --> 00:33:22,591
There isn't any there.
I looked.

586
00:33:23,557 --> 00:33:25,692
No, it's in the freezer
in the garage!

587
00:33:25,694 --> 00:33:27,159
It's in the garage!

588
00:33:27,161 --> 00:33:29,861
The one with all
the Kevin Costner magnets on it!

589
00:33:29,863 --> 00:33:31,164
Who's Kevin "Coster"?

590
00:33:31,166 --> 00:33:33,000
He was in that film.
What was it called?

591
00:33:33,002 --> 00:33:34,567
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matt...

592
00:33:34,569 --> 00:33:35,936
It's doesn't matter.

593
00:33:35,938 --> 00:33:38,272
It's the only freezer
that's in the garage.

594
00:33:38,274 --> 00:33:39,438
Okay.

595
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,709
Good night.

596
00:33:44,246 --> 00:33:45,444
Do you want some?

597
00:33:45,446 --> 00:33:47,550
No, thank you.

598
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:50,019
Okay.

599
00:33:51,986 --> 00:33:55,388
Oh, <i>Dances with Wolves!</i>

600
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:05,167
We gotta make him lunch.

601
00:34:07,034 --> 00:34:09,171
We have to make him lunch.

602
00:34:11,773 --> 00:34:13,943
We have to make him lunch.

603
00:34:16,543 --> 00:34:18,211
<i>Taco Bell.</i>

604
00:34:18,213 --> 00:34:20,613
- Pepperoni pizza.
- No.

605
00:34:20,615 --> 00:34:22,782
Come on, man, look.
It's got...

606
00:34:22,784 --> 00:34:26,952
tongue twisters, jokes,
and more mixed-up fun inside.

607
00:34:26,954 --> 00:34:29,354
No.

608
00:34:29,356 --> 00:34:31,759
Oh, God...

609
00:34:34,996 --> 00:34:36,963
All right.
Last offer.

610
00:34:36,965 --> 00:34:40,999
A 2-pound bag
of Sour Patch Kids for lunch.

611
00:34:41,001 --> 00:34:44,303
Candy is for dessert.

612
00:34:44,305 --> 00:34:46,707
You got all the flavors.

613
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:48,008
Blue.

614
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:49,979
Please.

615
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,588
Uh, we're still
serving breakfast.

616
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:02,821
For how long?

617
00:35:02,823 --> 00:35:05,658
Uh...
Another 45 minutes.

618
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,997
Oh, fuck you.

619
00:35:13,869 --> 00:35:15,401
Has it been
45 minutes yet?

620
00:35:15,403 --> 00:35:18,370
No, it's been two.

621
00:35:18,372 --> 00:35:21,774
I want 20 crunch wraps
with bacon, please.

622
00:35:21,776 --> 00:35:24,611
- Twenty?
- Twenty.

623
00:35:24,613 --> 00:35:25,979
Why'd you get 20 of 'em?

624
00:35:25,981 --> 00:35:27,314
Because I'm gonna freeze them

625
00:35:27,316 --> 00:35:29,651
and then thaw them out
every morning.

626
00:35:30,686 --> 00:35:33,885
That's... not going to work.

627
00:35:33,887 --> 00:35:35,555
And it's weird.

628
00:35:35,557 --> 00:35:38,925
Why can't I just take them
to school in a Taco Bell bag?

629
00:35:41,195 --> 00:35:44,930
Because I've written articles
for <i>Server</i> magazine.

630
00:35:44,932 --> 00:35:48,501
- Do you know what that is?
- No.

631
00:35:48,503 --> 00:35:51,139
Get the fuck out of my car.

632
00:36:05,686 --> 00:36:07,255
Mmm.

633
00:36:10,992 --> 00:36:14,227
So the bartender says,
"No? You don't know?

634
00:36:14,229 --> 00:36:17,396
You walk him
and pitch to the rhino."

635
00:36:19,133 --> 00:36:21,033
Why are you wearing chaps
at dinner?

636
00:36:21,035 --> 00:36:24,070
These used to belong
to Roy Rogers.

637
00:36:26,073 --> 00:36:27,673
- Please.
- Even though

638
00:36:27,675 --> 00:36:29,008
I don't believe
in reincarnation,

639
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:30,876
I am becoming more
and more convinced

640
00:36:30,878 --> 00:36:33,678
that in a previous life,
I was a cattle rustler.

641
00:36:35,284 --> 00:36:37,249
You just said you don't believe
in reincarnation.

642
00:36:37,251 --> 00:36:39,619
I can rustle cattle.
I roped a steer.

643
00:36:39,621 --> 00:36:41,889
You couldn't rope Ethel Merman.

644
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:45,892
Bill, do you like the place?

645
00:36:45,894 --> 00:36:47,426
Seriously, tell them
what time you go to bed.

646
00:36:47,428 --> 00:36:48,961
- Whenever I want.
- Oh...

647
00:36:48,963 --> 00:36:52,198
I want Erasmus and Paul
to be my granddaddys.

648
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,635
- You like Erasmus's cooking?
- No, it's gross.

649
00:36:57,773 --> 00:36:59,071
Where is your dad?

650
00:36:59,073 --> 00:37:00,939
He's in jail
for beating up a hooker.

651
00:37:02,878 --> 00:37:04,910
Where does he get this stuff?

652
00:37:04,912 --> 00:37:07,079
He's actually not kidding
about that.

653
00:37:07,081 --> 00:37:08,881
Oh. Heh.

654
00:37:08,883 --> 00:37:13,122
Um, well,
where's your mom?

655
00:37:13,921 --> 00:37:15,720
She was a drug addict.

656
00:37:15,722 --> 00:37:18,226
And she took
too many drugs one night.

657
00:37:19,093 --> 00:37:21,559
And she fell off the balcony.

658
00:37:21,561 --> 00:37:24,365
It was four stories high.

659
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:34,807
Where were you
when this happened?

660
00:37:34,809 --> 00:37:36,979
In the next room.

661
00:37:48,856 --> 00:37:54,829
Well, the good news
is I've made a pear tart.

662
00:38:22,689 --> 00:38:24,892
Hi.

663
00:38:25,827 --> 00:38:27,359
Hi.

664
00:38:27,361 --> 00:38:28,628
I'm Melissa Enright

665
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:30,932
with Child Protective Services.

666
00:38:32,834 --> 00:38:36,635
Hi. Hey, come...
come... come on in.

667
00:38:36,637 --> 00:38:39,040
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

668
00:38:40,742 --> 00:38:43,276
This is the first
of several mandated visits

669
00:38:43,278 --> 00:38:45,477
by the CPS of New Mexico.

670
00:38:45,479 --> 00:38:47,012
Fantastic.

671
00:38:47,014 --> 00:38:49,148
When a single parent
is arrested,

672
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:52,017
there's an inquiry
initiated by CPS.

673
00:38:52,019 --> 00:38:54,820
He's been here
for 10 weeks.

674
00:38:54,822 --> 00:38:56,388
We're backlogged.

675
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:57,957
So is he here?

676
00:38:59,061 --> 00:39:00,191
Who's that?

677
00:39:00,193 --> 00:39:03,729
Erasmus,
this is, uh...

678
00:39:03,731 --> 00:39:04,997
- Melissa.
- Melissa.

679
00:39:04,999 --> 00:39:07,332
From Child
Protective Services.

680
00:39:07,334 --> 00:39:08,934
Oh, shit.

681
00:39:08,936 --> 00:39:11,505
Uh, hello, Melissa,
I'm Erasmus.

682
00:39:13,073 --> 00:39:15,041
So, yeah, Bill's around.
And you haven't seen...

683
00:39:16,276 --> 00:39:18,211
I don't know.
I just got up.

684
00:39:18,213 --> 00:39:20,012
Is anything wrong?

685
00:39:20,014 --> 00:39:21,347
No, Melissa.

686
00:39:21,349 --> 00:39:24,584
Welcome to our humble
country abode.

687
00:39:24,586 --> 00:39:26,785
I'll just going to put
some coffee on.

688
00:39:26,787 --> 00:39:30,256
Ooh.
It's good coffee.

689
00:39:30,258 --> 00:39:35,428
Yes, also good
if we find the child.

690
00:39:37,697 --> 00:39:39,966
Oh, here he is.

691
00:39:39,968 --> 00:39:42,938
Right where we
sometimes find him.

692
00:39:43,939 --> 00:39:45,204
Hello.

693
00:39:45,206 --> 00:39:48,576
Yeah, he likes
to be called Bill.

694
00:39:50,544 --> 00:39:52,345
So they take me to school
every morning,

695
00:39:52,347 --> 00:39:54,981
and then they pick me up
every afternoon.

696
00:39:54,983 --> 00:39:57,584
Together? They both go?

697
00:39:57,586 --> 00:40:00,986
It's usually Paul.

698
00:40:00,988 --> 00:40:03,055
No, it's always Paul.

699
00:40:03,057 --> 00:40:05,225
Has anything happened here
at home

700
00:40:05,227 --> 00:40:08,330
that frightened
or disturbed you?

701
00:40:09,396 --> 00:40:11,097
No.

702
00:40:11,099 --> 00:40:13,135
Are you sure?

703
00:40:14,401 --> 00:40:15,867
Like what?

704
00:40:15,869 --> 00:40:19,540
Like any hitting or yelling?

705
00:40:20,807 --> 00:40:23,742
Mm, not really.

706
00:40:23,744 --> 00:40:25,544
Not really?

707
00:40:25,546 --> 00:40:26,611
You're not sure?

708
00:40:26,613 --> 00:40:27,946
I mean no.

709
00:40:27,948 --> 00:40:30,515
Have you seen anything
that confused you?

710
00:40:30,517 --> 00:40:36,287
Certain kinds of touching
that made you uncomfortable?

711
00:40:36,289 --> 00:40:37,323
No.

712
00:40:37,325 --> 00:40:39,158
It seems like
something happened

713
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:42,495
that you don't want
to talk to me about.

714
00:40:42,497 --> 00:40:44,666
But you can tell me
anything.

715
00:40:47,668 --> 00:40:49,734
Can't I just show you?

716
00:40:49,736 --> 00:40:51,271
Of course.

717
00:40:51,273 --> 00:40:55,374
Those flat shoes.
Flap, flap, flap, flap, flap.

718
00:40:55,376 --> 00:40:58,980
They're so flat,
it actually makes her shorter.

719
00:41:00,081 --> 00:41:04,483
It's not even an inch.
It's completely flat.

720
00:41:04,485 --> 00:41:05,952
Everything all right?

721
00:41:05,954 --> 00:41:09,358
Totally fine.
What a large room.

722
00:41:11,892 --> 00:41:13,526
The hell does that mean?

723
00:41:13,528 --> 00:41:15,530
I hate her.

724
00:41:16,664 --> 00:41:19,164
Excuse me...

725
00:41:19,166 --> 00:41:22,203
Would both of you
come this way, please?

726
00:41:24,139 --> 00:41:27,575
Do you think she heard us
calling her a dumb bitch?

727
00:41:31,646 --> 00:41:34,483
Hope she hasn't found
the porn. Heh.

728
00:41:36,617 --> 00:41:41,187
Yeah, I mean, most of the places
I go are really horrific.

729
00:41:41,189 --> 00:41:44,222
So when I saw this house,
I was like, "Lucky kid."

730
00:41:44,224 --> 00:41:46,158
But you can't give
a kid porno.

731
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,794
Yes, but the thing is,
they are all Paul's.

732
00:41:49,796 --> 00:41:51,564
What? No, they're not.

733
00:41:51,566 --> 00:41:52,999
Some of them.

734
00:41:53,001 --> 00:41:54,499
You know,
we keep this locked up.

735
00:41:54,501 --> 00:41:56,836
The thing about a lock is,
it has no meaning

736
00:41:56,838 --> 00:41:58,204
if there's a key in it.

737
00:41:58,206 --> 00:42:00,740
Is that Confucius? Heh.

738
00:42:00,742 --> 00:42:01,908
No, that's true.

739
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:03,376
I was just trying to find <i>ET.</i>

740
00:42:03,378 --> 00:42:05,010
- Hey. <i>ET.</i>
- Bill!

741
00:42:05,012 --> 00:42:08,847
- Classic Spielberg. Weaver of dreams.
- Oh.

742
00:42:08,849 --> 00:42:10,716
I love when
his finger lights up.

743
00:42:10,718 --> 00:42:12,151
That's how you can tell
he's an alien.

744
00:42:12,153 --> 00:42:14,289
- And his face.
- And his face.

745
00:42:15,322 --> 00:42:17,491
Bill, would you give us
a moment?

746
00:42:22,095 --> 00:42:24,229
<i>Sex Wars: Phantom Ass.</i>

747
00:42:24,231 --> 00:42:25,664
It's just a phase
he was going through.

748
00:42:25,666 --> 00:42:27,767
Yeah, I'm kind of
a <i>Star Wars</i> guy.

749
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:31,736
<i>Bareback Mountain?</i>

750
00:42:31,738 --> 00:42:33,571
What they do is take
a recognized title

751
00:42:33,573 --> 00:42:36,341
and just give it a bit
of a cheeky twist.

752
00:42:36,343 --> 00:42:37,642
- I get it.
- It's unusual in that

753
00:42:37,644 --> 00:42:41,650
the source material
is also... gay.

754
00:42:44,218 --> 00:42:46,651
<i>Buttpluggerz.</i>
We're throwing them all out.

755
00:42:46,653 --> 00:42:50,525
There's so much online.
What did I just say?

756
00:42:53,427 --> 00:42:55,961
Is it okay if I come back?

757
00:42:55,963 --> 00:42:57,162
Yes, any time.

758
00:42:57,164 --> 00:43:00,365
Great, good,
because I will be back.

759
00:43:00,367 --> 00:43:02,301
We long for you to return.

760
00:43:02,303 --> 00:43:06,104
Late mornings
generally are best.

761
00:43:06,106 --> 00:43:07,539
One last thing.

762
00:43:07,541 --> 00:43:09,575
It really feels like
you should be cooking

763
00:43:09,577 --> 00:43:12,144
something nutritious
for Bill at home,

764
00:43:12,146 --> 00:43:13,479
not just grabbing fast food,

765
00:43:13,481 --> 00:43:14,979
especially given
your line of work.

766
00:43:14,981 --> 00:43:17,182
- It's not me. It's him.
- That's great advice.

767
00:43:17,184 --> 00:43:20,889
Thank you so much
for that input.

768
00:43:22,889 --> 00:43:25,126
Have a good day.

769
00:43:27,327 --> 00:43:28,760
What a queer fish.

770
00:43:28,762 --> 00:43:30,731
Uh, <i>yeah.</i>

771
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,702
Does he have friends
outside of school?

772
00:43:36,704 --> 00:43:39,405
Uh, two of us.

773
00:43:39,407 --> 00:43:41,807
Household employees.

774
00:43:41,809 --> 00:43:42,941
Staff.

775
00:43:42,943 --> 00:43:44,544
Anyone his age?

776
00:43:44,546 --> 00:43:46,211
Uh, well, there's Tino.

777
00:43:46,213 --> 00:43:49,148
Oh, good, Tino.
How old is Tino?

778
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:50,349
24.

779
00:43:50,351 --> 00:43:53,287
No, he doesn't really.

780
00:43:54,287 --> 00:43:56,354
I would like to refer you

781
00:43:56,356 --> 00:43:59,858
to a developmental therapist
here in Santa Fe.

782
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:03,294
- Are you saying he's insane?
- No, no, no, of course not.

783
00:44:03,296 --> 00:44:05,430
But treatment
can benefit someone

784
00:44:05,432 --> 00:44:08,066
who's been living with
an unstable personality.

785
00:44:08,068 --> 00:44:09,734
Maybe I should get
some treatment.

786
00:44:09,736 --> 00:44:11,370
Of course,
if you feel that you...

787
00:44:11,372 --> 00:44:14,307
- He's joking.
- I...

788
00:44:14,309 --> 00:44:16,941
In any event,
I have a very important

789
00:44:16,943 --> 00:44:20,780
harvest-abundance episode of
my television program to record.

790
00:44:20,782 --> 00:44:22,648
So if you've nothing further
to say, I'll take my leave,

791
00:44:22,650 --> 00:44:25,617
and if you could find the time
to teach him how to spell,

792
00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:29,490
add and subtract,
that would suffice.

793
00:44:34,262 --> 00:44:35,961
Un-fucking-believable.

794
00:44:35,963 --> 00:44:37,997
She's just trying
to do her job, Paul.

795
00:44:37,999 --> 00:44:40,966
Not her. You, you dumb dick.

796
00:44:40,968 --> 00:44:43,570
- What?
- He <i>should</i> be making friends.

797
00:44:43,572 --> 00:44:45,070
My God, after
everything he's been...

798
00:44:45,072 --> 00:44:48,106
- What concern is it of yours?
- Excuse me?

799
00:44:48,108 --> 00:44:51,276
You've expressed how little
interest you have in him.

800
00:44:51,278 --> 00:44:52,912
Mm-hmm, and I pick him up
from school every day.

801
00:44:52,914 --> 00:44:55,648
And I appreciate your efforts,
but you made it abundantly clear

802
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:57,450
you don't want to be saddled
with the responsibility.

803
00:44:57,452 --> 00:44:59,619
Well, I am saddled
with the responsibility.

804
00:44:59,621 --> 00:45:01,519
When he first arrived
I thought, oh, I don't know

805
00:45:01,521 --> 00:45:02,921
- how we're going to handle...
- Paul...

806
00:45:02,923 --> 00:45:04,457
Can you make a mental note
of all this,

807
00:45:04,459 --> 00:45:06,425
and we can sort it out
over a smart cocktail?

808
00:45:06,427 --> 00:45:08,526
I have something
at stake here.

809
00:45:08,528 --> 00:45:10,296
- What?
- When he got here,

810
00:45:10,298 --> 00:45:12,030
I thought, oh, great,
you know what?

811
00:45:12,032 --> 00:45:13,832
I'm going to be stuck
with all the responsibility.

812
00:45:13,834 --> 00:45:16,369
And surprise,
I <i>am</i> stuck with it,

813
00:45:16,371 --> 00:45:19,070
but I will not wake up
early every day,

814
00:45:19,072 --> 00:45:21,807
wake him up, pack his lunch,
help him with his homework...

815
00:45:21,809 --> 00:45:23,575
yeah, by the way,
he has homework...

816
00:45:23,577 --> 00:45:26,144
and have you tell me
it has nothing to do with me.

817
00:45:27,615 --> 00:45:30,850
You know what? I am so sick
of being this furious.

818
00:45:30,852 --> 00:45:34,753
I... I give up.

819
00:45:34,755 --> 00:45:37,256
What am I doing?
You have to tape.

820
00:45:37,258 --> 00:45:39,124
I have to stay here
and pick him up.

821
00:45:39,126 --> 00:45:40,526
No, Tino can pick him up.

822
00:45:40,528 --> 00:45:42,428
- I'll pick him up.
- Don't be a martyr.

823
00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:44,633
Oh, God. This.

824
00:45:46,334 --> 00:45:48,901
This, I never imagined
for myself.

825
00:45:48,903 --> 00:45:50,436
I went to Wesleyan.

826
00:45:50,438 --> 00:45:52,704
My contemporaries
are scions of industry.

827
00:45:52,706 --> 00:45:55,941
I should be living in New York
running the Food Network,

828
00:45:55,943 --> 00:45:58,776
not sitting here
in this dusty pueblo

829
00:45:58,778 --> 00:46:00,780
babysitting the boy
from <i>The Shining.</i>

830
00:46:00,782 --> 00:46:03,249
Yeah, and I went to Oxford
and all my friends...

831
00:46:03,251 --> 00:46:05,818
You went to cooking school
in the town of Oxford.

832
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:08,019
- What's your point?
- It's a very different thing.

833
00:46:08,021 --> 00:46:09,254
What's your point?

834
00:46:09,256 --> 00:46:12,524
My friends
at <i>The Rachel Ray Show</i>

835
00:46:12,526 --> 00:46:15,626
called me again and told me

836
00:46:15,628 --> 00:46:19,366
there's still a job there
for me if I want it.

837
00:46:20,901 --> 00:46:22,570
Idle threat.

838
00:46:24,338 --> 00:46:25,704
Mm.

839
00:46:25,706 --> 00:46:28,676
Wait up, wait up!

840
00:46:30,945 --> 00:46:33,245
Wait, what do we do best?

841
00:46:33,247 --> 00:46:35,314
Drink and argue.

842
00:46:35,316 --> 00:46:36,682
Throw parties.

843
00:46:36,684 --> 00:46:38,450
We just need to give Bill
a proper birthday.

844
00:46:38,452 --> 00:46:40,352
- It's his birthday?
- Doesn't matter.

845
00:46:40,354 --> 00:46:42,055
But we do need to freshen up
the genre.

846
00:46:42,057 --> 00:46:44,523
We need a theme,
something stunning.

847
00:46:44,525 --> 00:46:47,660
I thought we were
in the middle of a fight.

848
00:46:47,662 --> 00:46:48,797
What?

849
00:46:50,932 --> 00:46:53,032
Forget "Pin the Tail
on the Donkey."

850
00:46:53,034 --> 00:46:55,233
Try "Pinning the Tail
on Ganesh,"

851
00:46:55,235 --> 00:46:59,271
the elephant-headed Hindu deity
at your next children's party.

852
00:46:59,273 --> 00:47:01,573
I'm going to take you on a tour
of the Indian subcontinent,

853
00:47:01,575 --> 00:47:03,642
where we're going
to discover the secrets

854
00:47:03,644 --> 00:47:07,213
of tandoori lobster dogs,
saffron cupcakes,

855
00:47:07,215 --> 00:47:09,517
and tamarind ice cream.

856
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:13,318
This is your passage to India.

857
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:18,222
I'm a Erasmus Brumble,
and this is <i>Ideal Home.</i>

858
00:47:23,631 --> 00:47:26,733
One of the staples
of authentic Indian cuisine

859
00:47:26,735 --> 00:47:29,635
is of course naan,
the indigenous flatbread.

860
00:47:29,637 --> 00:47:31,769
But I need someone
to help me roll the dough.

861
00:47:31,771 --> 00:47:33,372
- Heather...
- My name's not Heather.

862
00:47:33,374 --> 00:47:34,939
- It's Whitney.
- That's all right.

863
00:47:34,941 --> 00:47:36,675
Bill, would you like
to help me grind

864
00:47:36,677 --> 00:47:39,311
some tamarind paste
with this pestle and mortar?

865
00:47:39,313 --> 00:47:41,180
No. Let's get Taco Bell.

866
00:47:41,182 --> 00:47:42,715
- Yeah! Taco Bell!
- Cut!

867
00:47:42,717 --> 00:47:47,586
Taco Bell! Taco Bell!
Taco Bell! Taco Bell!

868
00:47:53,327 --> 00:47:55,227
- Hey.
- What?

869
00:47:55,229 --> 00:47:58,296
- Is this your party?
- Yeah.

870
00:47:58,298 --> 00:48:00,435
Do you have two dads?

871
00:48:01,401 --> 00:48:05,336
No. Well, I don't know.

872
00:48:05,338 --> 00:48:06,907
Sort of.

873
00:48:08,343 --> 00:48:10,075
That's littering.

874
00:48:10,077 --> 00:48:11,343
So what?

875
00:48:11,345 --> 00:48:13,111
We don't do that here.

876
00:48:27,394 --> 00:48:28,896
Wow!

877
00:48:31,965 --> 00:48:33,030
Wow!

878
00:48:33,032 --> 00:48:35,733
Oh, my gosh,
this has been so amazing.

879
00:48:35,735 --> 00:48:38,135
Um, Chelsea's got
a birthday next weekend.

880
00:48:38,137 --> 00:48:40,539
- Mmm...
- And we would so love

881
00:48:40,541 --> 00:48:42,709
to have you guys come.

882
00:48:43,610 --> 00:48:45,577
- Well, fantastic.
- Yeah?

883
00:48:45,579 --> 00:48:48,546
Try and keep us away.

884
00:48:55,590 --> 00:48:57,890
See, the Spurs need to stick
to what they do best,

885
00:48:57,892 --> 00:49:00,459
work as a team.
I mean, you got Ginobili,

886
00:49:00,461 --> 00:49:03,028
you got Leonard, small ball.
Thanks, hon.

887
00:49:03,030 --> 00:49:06,298
I don't really know
who those people are.

888
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:08,901
I don't even know what sport
you're talking about.

889
00:49:08,903 --> 00:49:10,568
I think
it's baseball, is it?

890
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:12,104
That's the one
with a small ball.

891
00:49:12,106 --> 00:49:13,705
I know that.

892
00:49:13,707 --> 00:49:16,709
- We're not really sporty types.
- No.

893
00:49:17,878 --> 00:49:20,979
Oh... Holy shit! Heh.

894
00:49:20,981 --> 00:49:24,115
I got my first blowie
when this song was playing.

895
00:49:24,117 --> 00:49:25,552
Oh?

896
00:49:28,255 --> 00:49:31,059
Um. She was...

897
00:49:32,293 --> 00:49:34,158
She was...

898
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:36,164
A girl?

899
00:49:37,231 --> 00:49:38,396
Yeah.

900
00:49:38,398 --> 00:49:40,767
Did she have
big old tits?

901
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:46,070
We just got the couch.
You can have ice in there.

902
00:49:46,072 --> 00:49:48,474
You can have beer in there.
You can sit back, relax.

903
00:49:48,476 --> 00:49:53,144
Functional, stylish, comfy.
What more could you ask for?

904
00:49:54,447 --> 00:49:56,414
You know, it's not like
on your TV show but...

905
00:49:56,416 --> 00:49:58,582
Oh, no...

906
00:49:58,584 --> 00:50:03,756
- But... I mean...
- Well...

907
00:50:03,758 --> 00:50:05,390
Everyone's different,
aren't they?

908
00:50:05,392 --> 00:50:07,492
The world would be a pretty dull
place if we were all the same.

909
00:50:07,494 --> 00:50:08,926
- Hear, hear.
- Right?

910
00:50:09,863 --> 00:50:10,762
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry.

911
00:50:10,764 --> 00:50:12,030
Would you...

912
00:50:12,032 --> 00:50:14,134
Would you rather
have white wine?

913
00:50:16,938 --> 00:50:18,303
Uh...

914
00:50:18,305 --> 00:50:19,570
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

915
00:50:19,572 --> 00:50:21,238
Yeah? Okay.
Sorry about that.

916
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:23,774
You know what,
they seem like a nice family.

917
00:50:23,776 --> 00:50:25,077
They seem happy.

918
00:50:25,079 --> 00:50:28,747
Yeah, well,
I'd rather be all fucked up

919
00:50:28,749 --> 00:50:30,481
and live in a nice house.

920
00:50:30,483 --> 00:50:33,086
Well, then, dreams
really do come true.

921
00:50:33,954 --> 00:50:36,387
And of that song
has invaded my mind.

922
00:50:36,389 --> 00:50:38,224
Oh, that fucking song.

923
00:50:43,831 --> 00:50:45,829
- All right, bye.
- See you tomorrow, Bill.

924
00:50:45,831 --> 00:50:47,865
Bye.

925
00:50:47,867 --> 00:50:52,204
Well, they seem like nice boys.
What are their names?

926
00:50:52,206 --> 00:50:55,274
One is named Lantem...

927
00:50:55,276 --> 00:50:56,675
Lathem... Lathem!

928
00:50:56,677 --> 00:51:00,048
And the other is named...
I don't know.

929
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:04,015
Okay. Well, I had to park
on the other block.

930
00:51:04,017 --> 00:51:07,186
It was so crowded.

931
00:51:07,188 --> 00:51:10,291
Idiot!

932
00:51:11,959 --> 00:51:14,160
Not... Not you, him.
Are you all right?

933
00:51:14,162 --> 00:51:15,361
Yeah.

934
00:51:15,363 --> 00:51:18,396
Oh! Why don't you hold
my hand for now?

935
00:51:18,398 --> 00:51:19,631
No.

936
00:51:19,633 --> 00:51:21,033
Bill, take my hand.

937
00:51:21,035 --> 00:51:22,901
- I don't want to.
- You were almost killed.

938
00:51:22,903 --> 00:51:24,903
- I don't care!
- I do! I'm the adult!

939
00:51:24,905 --> 00:51:26,604
You're the child!
And you're gonna do as I say!

940
00:51:26,606 --> 00:51:28,041
Fuck you!

941
00:51:35,849 --> 00:51:38,218
What's the matter?

942
00:51:40,053 --> 00:51:42,754
I c-can't... I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.

943
00:51:44,358 --> 00:51:45,892
I can't breathe.

944
00:51:55,369 --> 00:51:57,005
I need an ambulance.

945
00:52:05,678 --> 00:52:07,778
- Are you having chest pain now?
- Yeah.

946
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:10,381
Are you going to be okay?

947
00:52:10,383 --> 00:52:12,885
I don't know.

948
00:52:14,521 --> 00:52:17,455
Your blood pressure
is a little high,

949
00:52:17,457 --> 00:52:20,193
but I don't see anything else.

950
00:52:22,128 --> 00:52:24,398
Have you ever had
a panic attack?

951
00:52:26,532 --> 00:52:27,599
Hmm?

952
00:52:27,601 --> 00:52:28,800
Do you have any history

953
00:52:28,802 --> 00:52:31,672
of anxiety or panic attacks?

954
00:52:32,907 --> 00:52:34,740
I do. I, uh...

955
00:52:34,742 --> 00:52:38,676
I... I think
I'm having a heart attack,

956
00:52:38,678 --> 00:52:40,945
and it, uh...

957
00:52:40,947 --> 00:52:42,914
it turns out to be anxiety.

958
00:52:42,916 --> 00:52:46,453
So you've called
an ambulance before?

959
00:52:47,521 --> 00:52:48,620
Yeah.

960
00:52:48,622 --> 00:52:50,191
How many times?

961
00:52:53,994 --> 00:52:57,229
Nine times maybe?
About nine times.

962
00:53:00,568 --> 00:53:01,800
Yeah.

963
00:53:01,802 --> 00:53:04,570
<i>But you saved his life.</i>

964
00:53:04,572 --> 00:53:07,138
You get a coupon for redemption

965
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:09,506
when you arrive
at the gates of heaven.

966
00:53:09,508 --> 00:53:11,843
Mmm. It was so disturbing,

967
00:53:11,845 --> 00:53:14,546
watching the kid
almost get killed,

968
00:53:14,548 --> 00:53:19,053
and then the screaming match,
and then I had one of my things.

969
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:21,653
What things?

970
00:53:21,655 --> 00:53:22,887
My panic things.

971
00:53:22,889 --> 00:53:25,459
You didn't call an ambulance.

972
00:53:27,193 --> 00:53:29,593
Oh, no.

973
00:53:29,595 --> 00:53:31,129
It was humiliating.

974
00:53:31,131 --> 00:53:32,731
We didn't even make it
to the hospital.

975
00:53:32,733 --> 00:53:35,200
The EMT just told me
to take it easy.

976
00:53:35,202 --> 00:53:37,968
And death is cheated once more.

977
00:53:37,970 --> 00:53:40,638
Away, you shadowy specter.

978
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,441
Where are my pills?

979
00:53:42,443 --> 00:53:44,977
Hey, hey, just, you know,
have a tequila

980
00:53:44,979 --> 00:53:47,412
and think pleasant thoughts.

981
00:53:47,414 --> 00:53:48,946
Oh, God, I can't.

982
00:53:48,948 --> 00:53:51,048
Every night my dreams end
in the Apocalypse,

983
00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:53,852
alien invasions,
and mega tsunamis.

984
00:53:53,854 --> 00:53:55,586
Your dreams are
so big-budget.

985
00:53:55,588 --> 00:53:58,524
I just dream I'm naked
and people are laughing at me.

986
00:53:58,526 --> 00:54:00,959
Oh. I dream that, too.

987
00:54:00,961 --> 00:54:04,729
You know,
eventually, you just have to

988
00:54:04,731 --> 00:54:08,401
make a decision to be happy.

989
00:54:11,505 --> 00:54:13,805
Never do that voice again.

990
00:54:21,814 --> 00:54:24,883
Rise and shine.

991
00:54:24,885 --> 00:54:26,651
Come on, kiddo.
Time to get up.

992
00:54:28,222 --> 00:54:31,088
School. Did you finish
your book report?

993
00:54:31,090 --> 00:54:32,959
Yes.

994
00:54:54,548 --> 00:54:56,948
You want to tell me
what my anxiety medication

995
00:54:56,950 --> 00:54:59,153
is doing in your backpack?

996
00:55:03,289 --> 00:55:05,624
Have you taken
any of these?

997
00:55:05,626 --> 00:55:07,459
No.

998
00:55:07,461 --> 00:55:08,926
Well, where are they?

999
00:55:08,928 --> 00:55:10,762
The entire bottle
is missing.

1000
00:55:10,764 --> 00:55:12,064
I don't have them.

1001
00:55:12,066 --> 00:55:14,334
What have you done with them?

1002
00:55:16,535 --> 00:55:19,974
Out with it, young man.
This is serious.

1003
00:55:23,543 --> 00:55:27,412
I sold them to this kid
in the middle school.

1004
00:55:27,414 --> 00:55:30,448
- Thank God for that.
- Thank God?

1005
00:55:30,450 --> 00:55:32,416
Well, at least he hasn't
taken them himself.

1006
00:55:32,418 --> 00:55:36,086
Wh-? Where would you get an idea
to do something like that?

1007
00:55:37,525 --> 00:55:39,057
What?

1008
00:55:39,059 --> 00:55:41,425
His father.
Your father.

1009
00:55:41,427 --> 00:55:44,363
Oh, well, yeah.
I mean, that's... Okay.

1010
00:55:44,365 --> 00:55:47,635
Why did you feel
the need to do this?

1011
00:55:49,302 --> 00:55:52,169
- I needed money.
- For what?

1012
00:55:52,171 --> 00:55:56,010
Don't we buy you
everything you could ask for?

1013
00:55:56,809 --> 00:55:59,313
I need money in case...

1014
00:56:00,847 --> 00:56:03,183
In case what?

1015
00:56:04,251 --> 00:56:06,483
In case I'm not here.

1016
00:56:06,485 --> 00:56:09,787
In case that Melissa lady
takes me or something.

1017
00:56:18,599 --> 00:56:19,865
Listen to me.

1018
00:56:19,867 --> 00:56:23,568
You're not going
anywhere, okay?

1019
00:56:23,570 --> 00:56:25,137
I won't let it happen.

1020
00:56:25,139 --> 00:56:27,039
We won't let it happen.

1021
00:56:27,041 --> 00:56:29,207
Look at me.

1022
00:56:29,209 --> 00:56:33,247
We promise.
Do you understand?

1023
00:56:34,981 --> 00:56:38,184
And if you promise
not to deal drugs...

1024
00:56:40,086 --> 00:56:41,787
we'll give you $100
a week.

1025
00:56:41,789 --> 00:56:45,691
Wait, no. 50.

1026
00:56:45,693 --> 00:56:47,526
Okay.

1027
00:56:47,528 --> 00:56:49,597
I'll do it for 100.

1028
00:56:51,497 --> 00:56:52,930
- Okay. All right, yeah.
- Oh.

1029
00:56:52,932 --> 00:56:55,066
- Okay, Great. Great!
- Yay!

1030
00:56:55,068 --> 00:56:58,003
All right!
High fives all around.

1031
00:56:59,972 --> 00:57:01,939
- Good job.
- Crisis averted.

1032
00:57:01,941 --> 00:57:04,575
Bring it. We did it.

1033
00:57:04,577 --> 00:57:07,113
Yay!

1034
00:57:49,021 --> 00:57:50,623
Good dinner. Good.

1035
00:58:28,461 --> 00:58:31,264
Come on, Bill.

1036
00:58:32,499 --> 00:58:35,136
No, you're not gonna
make me do it.

1037
00:58:46,579 --> 00:58:50,115
"In conclusion, my parents
have taught me about recycling

1038
00:58:50,117 --> 00:58:52,584
"because they love me,
and they love the Earth.

1039
00:58:52,586 --> 00:58:54,019
The end."

1040
00:58:54,021 --> 00:58:56,122
All right.

1041
00:58:57,490 --> 00:59:02,496
Thank you, Symphony.
And next is Bill.

1042
00:59:09,470 --> 00:59:11,836
"I live with Paul and Erasmus."

1043
00:59:11,838 --> 00:59:14,738
Bill, remember, look
your audience in the eye.

1044
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:18,111
Okay? And let's try it
a little louder.

1045
00:59:20,914 --> 00:59:24,215
"I live with Paul and
Erasmus. They are not my dads.

1046
00:59:24,217 --> 00:59:26,720
"But they do
all the stuff dads do.

1047
00:59:28,088 --> 00:59:29,454
"They are gay.

1048
00:59:29,456 --> 00:59:31,590
"In the olden days,
it was illegal to be gay.

1049
00:59:31,592 --> 00:59:33,591
"There are some words
you should never use

1050
00:59:33,593 --> 00:59:37,164
"when you are talking
to someone who is gay.

1051
00:59:38,164 --> 00:59:40,231
"Never say 'faggot.'

1052
00:59:42,269 --> 00:59:45,537
- "Never say 'cocksucker.'
- Bill!

1053
00:59:46,939 --> 00:59:49,372
"And never, ever, ever say..."

1054
00:59:49,374 --> 00:59:51,142
Bill, please stop! No!

1055
00:59:51,144 --> 00:59:53,010
"Buttfucking."

1056
00:59:57,916 --> 01:00:00,419
"In the olden days,
it was illegal to be gay."

1057
01:00:00,421 --> 01:00:01,686
Indeed it was.

1058
01:00:01,688 --> 01:00:03,354
"Some words you should
never say

1059
01:00:03,356 --> 01:00:04,856
"when you are talking
to someone who is gay.

1060
01:00:04,858 --> 01:00:07,591
"Never say 'faggot.'
Never say 'cocksucker.'"

1061
01:00:09,296 --> 01:00:11,229
Unfortunately,
the school district

1062
01:00:11,231 --> 01:00:13,698
doesn't find quite
the same sense of humor

1063
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:15,300
in this situation.

1064
01:00:15,302 --> 01:00:18,570
He... He said this aloud
in, in class?

1065
01:00:18,572 --> 01:00:23,073
Up to and including that word.

1066
01:00:25,744 --> 01:00:28,879
Did he say "buttfucking"?
Did he say "buttfucking"?

1067
01:00:30,918 --> 01:00:34,220
- Never, ever say "buttfucking."
- Gentlemen!

1068
01:00:37,890 --> 01:00:40,258
Where do you think
he's learning these terms?

1069
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:44,229
Um... It's... it's...
We don't make a habit

1070
01:00:44,231 --> 01:00:46,798
of using words like that,
I have to say.

1071
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:51,535
Um, unless it...
unless it's in context.

1072
01:00:51,537 --> 01:00:53,204
I see where he gets it.

1073
01:00:53,206 --> 01:00:54,606
I hate to say this,
but I do think it's a case

1074
01:00:54,608 --> 01:00:56,108
of pot calling the kettle black?

1075
01:00:56,110 --> 01:00:58,209
I did notice the word "felching"

1076
01:00:58,211 --> 01:00:59,943
on your classroom wall,

1077
01:00:59,945 --> 01:01:03,316
which I thought was highly
inappropriate in a classroom.

1078
01:01:04,084 --> 01:01:05,550
That is "felting."

1079
01:01:05,552 --> 01:01:08,720
Oh, yeah,
that makes more sense.

1080
01:01:08,722 --> 01:01:10,888
Felching isn't
until middle school.

1081
01:01:10,890 --> 01:01:14,559
I am so not into that.
Can't speak for him.

1082
01:01:14,561 --> 01:01:16,762
Guilty as charged.

1083
01:01:16,764 --> 01:01:21,932
- This is serious.
- Hello? Oh, yes.

1084
01:01:21,934 --> 01:01:24,604
We were wondering when we were
going to hear from you.

1085
01:01:25,604 --> 01:01:27,939
How's it going, Angel?
How you doing?

1086
01:01:27,941 --> 01:01:29,541
Tell them how
you're doing, Bill.

1087
01:01:29,543 --> 01:01:33,044
- Good.
- He likes to be called Bill.

1088
01:01:33,046 --> 01:01:36,615
Bill? Is that right?

1089
01:01:36,617 --> 01:01:39,283
Well, you know, angels were one
of your mom's favorite things.

1090
01:01:39,285 --> 01:01:41,352
So that's why
we named you Angel.

1091
01:01:41,354 --> 01:01:44,254
That's still his name legally,
of course.

1092
01:01:44,256 --> 01:01:46,624
But he's been doing great
at school.

1093
01:01:46,626 --> 01:01:50,294
Uh, a whole spate of friends,
and...

1094
01:01:50,296 --> 01:01:51,896
Would you like
to tell your father

1095
01:01:51,898 --> 01:01:53,865
about your new friends,
young man?

1096
01:01:53,867 --> 01:01:55,903
No.

1097
01:01:57,503 --> 01:02:00,104
Well, it sounds like
you're doing really good.

1098
01:02:00,106 --> 01:02:02,374
And, you know, I've been
doing really good in here.

1099
01:02:02,376 --> 01:02:05,542
I've been going to church.
I feel a lot better now.

1100
01:02:05,544 --> 01:02:07,111
I'm so clearheaded.

1101
01:02:07,113 --> 01:02:10,215
The big news is the minister's
really gone all out

1102
01:02:10,217 --> 01:02:11,682
for me to get an early release.

1103
01:02:11,684 --> 01:02:14,051
So I'm gonna be out of here
before New Year's.

1104
01:02:14,053 --> 01:02:15,787
- Bravo.
- And the church has also

1105
01:02:15,789 --> 01:02:18,088
set me up with
a sponsor in Arizona.

1106
01:02:18,090 --> 01:02:19,390
So when I do get out of here,

1107
01:02:19,392 --> 01:02:20,892
me and Angel
are gonna go to Arizona,

1108
01:02:20,894 --> 01:02:23,397
and we're gonna start working
for a minister there.

1109
01:02:24,631 --> 01:02:27,731
- Arizona?
- Yeah, that's right.

1110
01:02:27,733 --> 01:02:30,468
I think we need consider
how the boy

1111
01:02:30,470 --> 01:02:33,171
has settled in
at school here in Santa Fe.

1112
01:02:33,173 --> 01:02:34,805
He has a lot of friends.

1113
01:02:34,807 --> 01:02:36,774
There's a school at the church.
He'll make new friends.

1114
01:02:36,776 --> 01:02:38,343
Well, I think, I think
we need to consider

1115
01:02:38,345 --> 01:02:41,345
- all this very carefully.
- He's my boy.

1116
01:02:41,347 --> 01:02:44,015
I thank you both
for taking care of him.

1117
01:02:44,017 --> 01:02:50,323
But there is a plan in place.
And it's a good plan.

1118
01:02:51,090 --> 01:02:53,191
What if I want to stay?

1119
01:02:53,193 --> 01:02:55,593
All is well,
and all will be well.

1120
01:02:55,595 --> 01:02:58,829
- But do I have to go?
- Okay, look.

1121
01:02:58,831 --> 01:03:00,530
If I tell you something,
will you promise

1122
01:03:00,532 --> 01:03:02,934
to remember it
for as long as you can?

1123
01:03:02,936 --> 01:03:04,838
Yeah.

1124
01:03:06,106 --> 01:03:09,543
Everything is temporary.

1125
01:03:18,084 --> 01:03:19,783
Except herpes.

1126
01:03:19,785 --> 01:03:22,555
- What's herpes?
- Paul...

1127
01:03:26,026 --> 01:03:27,825
I'm not trying
to arrange permanent custody.

1128
01:03:27,827 --> 01:03:30,028
I'm just trying to see
if I can somehow delay

1129
01:03:30,030 --> 01:03:31,829
the child going to him.

1130
01:03:31,831 --> 01:03:34,432
He finally has some stability.
It must count for something.

1131
01:03:34,434 --> 01:03:36,600
<i>Well, there just
isn't a court in the country</i>

1132
01:03:36,602 --> 01:03:38,836
<i>that is gonna separate
a child from his parent.</i>

1133
01:03:38,838 --> 01:03:40,604
<i>There just isn't,
unless the child</i>

1134
01:03:40,606 --> 01:03:43,006
<i>is in some kind of
quantifiable danger.</i>

1135
01:03:43,008 --> 01:03:45,709
<i>I'm sorry, Erasmus, you really
don't have any leverage.</i>

1136
01:03:45,711 --> 01:03:47,912
Well, thank you
for what has effectively been

1137
01:03:47,914 --> 01:03:50,182
a $400 phone call
for you to say no.

1138
01:03:50,184 --> 01:03:51,950
- Piss off.
- <i>Era...</i>

1139
01:03:51,952 --> 01:03:53,718
Assholes,
the lot of them!

1140
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:56,519
We should probably
watch our language here.

1141
01:03:56,521 --> 01:03:58,523
- Why?
- Because it's a fucking church.

1142
01:03:58,525 --> 01:04:01,358
I'm just trying to get the boy
away from his idiotic father.

1143
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:05,095
Well, you might not get that.
You might not get what you want.

1144
01:04:05,097 --> 01:04:06,900
Well, why not, Paul?

1145
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:09,334
Because God hates you.

1146
01:04:11,171 --> 01:04:14,472
Look, we have him
through the holidays.

1147
01:04:14,474 --> 01:04:16,410
All right?

1148
01:04:17,878 --> 01:04:20,611
Come on.
Let's put on a show.

1149
01:04:20,613 --> 01:04:23,082
- I was going to say that.
- I know.

1150
01:04:29,088 --> 01:04:32,222
<i>In Mexico and
many Latin American countries,</i>

1151
01:04:32,224 --> 01:04:36,093
<i>Christmas Eve is celebrated
even more than the day itself.</i>

1152
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:40,164
<i>In my home, I like to prepare
a flavorful Mexican supper</i>

1153
01:04:40,166 --> 01:04:43,233
<i>of fresh-made
green-corn tamales,</i>

1154
01:04:43,235 --> 01:04:44,635
<i>whole roast pig</i>

1155
01:04:44,637 --> 01:04:47,771
<i>and
for dessert.</i>

1156
01:04:47,773 --> 01:04:50,675
<i>Afterwards, we'll attend
a traditional pageant</i>

1157
01:04:50,677 --> 01:04:52,244
<i>known as La Posadas,</i>

1158
01:04:52,246 --> 01:04:54,111
<i>which retells the story
of Mary and Joseph</i>

1159
01:04:54,113 --> 01:04:56,613
<i>looking for shelter
in Bethlehem.</i>

1160
01:04:56,615 --> 01:05:02,422
<i>Then we cross the Atlantic
for a proper English dinner.</i>

1161
01:05:03,657 --> 01:05:05,856
No, further out.
Further out.

1162
01:05:09,095 --> 01:05:11,629
I'll say,
you look handsome.

1163
01:05:13,999 --> 01:05:16,367
You're allowed
to take one present.

1164
01:05:16,369 --> 01:05:18,102
Well, how about three?

1165
01:05:18,104 --> 01:05:21,108
- Oh, okay.
- Okay.

1166
01:05:40,860 --> 01:05:43,628
- Yeah?
- O.M.G.

1167
01:05:43,630 --> 01:05:46,129
Do we have more?

1168
01:05:46,131 --> 01:05:47,465
Wow.

1169
01:06:06,887 --> 01:06:09,823
Okay, and cue the harem.

1170
01:06:12,592 --> 01:06:15,496
And heavenly glow.

1171
01:06:53,099 --> 01:06:57,300
This really is
the land of enchantment.

1172
01:06:57,302 --> 01:06:59,238
Oh, so nice.

1173
01:07:04,577 --> 01:07:05,843
They let you out.

1174
01:07:05,845 --> 01:07:08,445
Yeah, Merry Christmas.

1175
01:07:08,447 --> 01:07:11,317
- Merry Christmas.
- Hey, bud.

1176
01:07:12,485 --> 01:07:15,756
Come on, you want to come
over here and give me a hug?

1177
01:07:17,222 --> 01:07:19,793
Attaboy.

1178
01:07:20,727 --> 01:07:24,762
How you doing?
You okay? Oh, God.

1179
01:07:24,764 --> 01:07:26,798
- This is absurd!
- It's just the way it is!

1180
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:28,399
This was never supposed
to be permanent.

1181
01:07:28,401 --> 01:07:30,401
Why are you doing this?!
You trying to infuriate me?!

1182
01:07:30,403 --> 01:07:33,004
You trying to cause as much
anguish as you possibly can?

1183
01:07:33,006 --> 01:07:35,872
Oh, stop it, the world
doesn't spin around you.

1184
01:07:35,874 --> 01:07:37,675
No, it spins around the boy,
and you're trying

1185
01:07:37,677 --> 01:07:40,611
to yank him away from the one
decent Christmas he's ever had

1186
01:07:40,613 --> 01:07:42,445
in the middle
of the fucking night!

1187
01:07:42,447 --> 01:07:44,948
That's what this is all about
isn't it, some big spectacle!

1188
01:07:44,950 --> 01:07:47,218
Do you know that presents
and all the decorations

1189
01:07:47,220 --> 01:07:48,919
in the world,
that doesn't make Christmas.

1190
01:07:48,921 --> 01:07:50,421
For a little boy, it does.

1191
01:07:50,423 --> 01:07:53,457
No, family makes Christmas.
And I'm his father.

1192
01:07:53,459 --> 01:07:56,626
You seem to have forgotten
that I'm <i>your</i> father.

1193
01:07:56,628 --> 01:07:59,530
Oh.

1194
01:07:59,532 --> 01:08:01,265
Do you want to go there?

1195
01:08:01,267 --> 01:08:03,667
No.

1196
01:08:03,669 --> 01:08:08,675
Please, at least
stay the night.

1197
01:08:14,247 --> 01:08:16,481
Why is the music so loud?!

1198
01:08:17,683 --> 01:08:19,217
What?!

1199
01:08:19,219 --> 01:08:21,084
You were shouting.

1200
01:08:21,086 --> 01:08:22,419
Oh, yes.

1201
01:08:22,421 --> 01:08:25,288
Yes! Yes!

1202
01:08:25,290 --> 01:08:30,227
Well, this Christmas looks epic.
Santa has come early.

1203
01:08:30,229 --> 01:08:32,829
I'll believe in Santa
if this is what it gets me.

1204
01:08:32,831 --> 01:08:34,330
Smokin' board.

1205
01:08:34,332 --> 01:08:36,700
Why don't we have
a proper breakfast tomorrow?

1206
01:08:36,702 --> 01:08:40,104
Um, we should start a brioche.

1207
01:08:40,106 --> 01:08:41,806
And then perhaps
something sweet,

1208
01:08:41,808 --> 01:08:43,140
a nutty sticky bun.

1209
01:08:43,142 --> 01:08:45,075
That means,
"Paul, go make brioche

1210
01:08:45,077 --> 01:08:47,013
and a sticky, nutty bun."

1211
01:08:47,813 --> 01:08:49,247
Don't I know it?

1212
01:08:49,249 --> 01:08:51,215
Who would like a drink?

1213
01:08:51,217 --> 01:08:53,184
Bo?

1214
01:08:53,186 --> 01:08:54,918
I'm sober.

1215
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:57,387
Ah, yes. So am I.

1216
01:08:57,389 --> 01:09:01,093
Unlike you, however, I'm going
to do something about it.

1217
01:09:02,128 --> 01:09:04,798
- I'll have a...
- I know.

1218
01:09:16,442 --> 01:09:19,780
What? What? What is it?

1219
01:09:23,316 --> 01:09:25,152
They're gone.

1220
01:09:26,818 --> 01:09:28,754
They're gone.

1221
01:09:35,762 --> 01:09:38,995
I didn't even get
to say goodbye.

1222
01:09:38,997 --> 01:09:42,302
I know.
Me either.

1223
01:09:59,719 --> 01:10:01,718
We drove 200 miles
to get here.

1224
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:03,354
You said you would meet us.

1225
01:10:03,356 --> 01:10:04,989
All right,
we've been here for hours.

1226
01:10:04,991 --> 01:10:07,257
We look like a couple
of child predators.

1227
01:10:07,259 --> 01:10:10,627
The only thing we're missing
is a white van.

1228
01:10:10,629 --> 01:10:14,765
I apologize for my friend.

1229
01:10:14,767 --> 01:10:17,501
We're quite normal.

1230
01:10:17,503 --> 01:10:19,872
Do you want some candy?

1231
01:10:24,076 --> 01:10:25,577
<i>Are you all right?</i>

1232
01:10:25,579 --> 01:10:29,814
Well, you sound like
you may have relapsed.

1233
01:10:31,416 --> 01:10:34,952
Don't get me wrong.
I used to <i>love</i> cocaine.

1234
01:10:34,954 --> 01:10:37,424
Let's talk about
what we have in common. Heh.

1235
01:10:39,858 --> 01:10:41,225
All right, let's not.

1236
01:10:41,227 --> 01:10:43,694
I'm just saying
that if you need help,

1237
01:10:43,696 --> 01:10:45,395
I know a very good
rehab facility

1238
01:10:45,397 --> 01:10:47,030
in Tucson, Arizona.

1239
01:10:47,032 --> 01:10:49,801
Um, it has a high failure rate,
but the food's terrific,

1240
01:10:49,803 --> 01:10:52,604
and the group sessions
are hilarious.

1241
01:10:52,606 --> 01:10:53,939
Hello?

1242
01:10:56,308 --> 01:10:58,244
Hello...

1243
01:11:17,929 --> 01:11:20,099
Shall I move the orchid?

1244
01:11:20,967 --> 01:11:22,469
It's fine.

1245
01:11:34,947 --> 01:11:37,448
Wherever we go,
it's so depressing.

1246
01:11:37,450 --> 01:11:40,083
He feels like he has
to pass it on to other people.

1247
01:11:40,085 --> 01:11:41,718
It's like having a broom
up his ass.

1248
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:45,556
What's going on...?

1249
01:11:45,558 --> 01:11:47,394
Hello.

1250
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:50,493
What's going on in here?

1251
01:11:50,495 --> 01:11:53,663
I was in the kitchen,
and I suddenly got very upset.

1252
01:11:53,665 --> 01:11:54,931
- Didn't I?
- Yeah.

1253
01:11:54,933 --> 01:11:57,603
And Tino was comforting me.

1254
01:11:59,571 --> 01:12:01,171
Why is the door closed?

1255
01:12:01,173 --> 01:12:04,577
It's not like that, Paul.

1256
01:12:06,713 --> 01:12:07,944
Why is the door closed?

1257
01:12:07,946 --> 01:12:10,516
Nothing happened, Paul.

1258
01:12:29,934 --> 01:12:32,872
I'm bereft about
the child being gone.

1259
01:12:33,939 --> 01:12:35,575
So am I.

1260
01:12:36,776 --> 01:12:40,077
You didn't even
want him here.

1261
01:12:40,079 --> 01:12:42,249
How can you say that?

1262
01:12:43,448 --> 01:12:45,182
Shame on you.

1263
01:12:45,184 --> 01:12:47,851
You know, you dismiss me
left and right.

1264
01:12:47,853 --> 01:12:50,520
But I did all the work.
I was the parent.

1265
01:12:50,522 --> 01:12:52,222
You clowned around.

1266
01:12:52,224 --> 01:12:53,524
Well, all right then.

1267
01:12:53,526 --> 01:12:54,992
You know what,
it doesn't matter.

1268
01:12:54,994 --> 01:12:56,025
We're not talking
about the kid.

1269
01:12:56,027 --> 01:12:57,727
This is about that.

1270
01:12:57,729 --> 01:13:00,029
Has it been going on
since you hired him?

1271
01:13:00,031 --> 01:13:01,998
I didn't touch Tino.
Nothing happened.

1272
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,234
He was just a shoulder
to cry on.

1273
01:13:03,236 --> 01:13:05,438
I'm your shoulder
to cry on.

1274
01:13:07,673 --> 01:13:09,073
Anyway, you know what?
It doesn't matter

1275
01:13:09,075 --> 01:13:10,440
what happened in there.

1276
01:13:10,442 --> 01:13:11,874
It happened before.
Which you admit.

1277
01:13:11,876 --> 01:13:13,543
With that gardener.
You admit.

1278
01:13:13,545 --> 01:13:15,078
Yes, I admit.

1279
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:17,047
Well, it's going
to happen again.

1280
01:13:17,049 --> 01:13:20,184
It won't happen again.

1281
01:13:20,186 --> 01:13:23,553
Look, I think
you and I both know

1282
01:13:23,555 --> 01:13:25,655
things have been pretty
fucked up between us

1283
01:13:25,657 --> 01:13:27,190
for a long time.

1284
01:13:27,192 --> 01:13:30,060
When the kid showed up,
I pretended everything was...

1285
01:13:30,062 --> 01:13:31,928
fine.

1286
01:13:31,930 --> 01:13:35,166
But I can't pretend anymore.
I can't.

1287
01:13:35,168 --> 01:13:37,400
- Paul...
- Listen to me.

1288
01:13:37,402 --> 01:13:40,236
You know
that if you were dying,

1289
01:13:40,238 --> 01:13:44,609
I would cut the heart
out of my chest for you.

1290
01:13:44,611 --> 01:13:47,412
I would die
so that you would live.

1291
01:13:47,414 --> 01:13:51,981
That's how much I love you.
That's how much I worship you.

1292
01:13:51,983 --> 01:13:55,118
And I think that you
actually know.

1293
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:57,289
You know that.

1294
01:13:58,624 --> 01:14:01,225
- And it doesn't matter to you.
- It does matter to me.

1295
01:14:01,227 --> 01:14:05,598
It doesn't matter.
And I can't stand it anymore.

1296
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:30,754
You know, I, uh...
I didn't tell you,

1297
01:14:30,756 --> 01:14:34,460
but I got a call
the other day from Rachel Ray.

1298
01:14:36,461 --> 01:14:38,762
Oh.

1299
01:14:38,764 --> 01:14:42,733
What's she like?
I hear she's really nice.

1300
01:14:42,735 --> 01:14:44,200
No, not from her.

1301
01:14:44,202 --> 01:14:47,337
From my friends
who produce her show.

1302
01:14:47,339 --> 01:14:52,411
They, uh... They offered me
a job in New York.

1303
01:14:56,749 --> 01:14:58,082
I'm going to take it.

1304
01:15:13,465 --> 01:15:16,066
Well, I'm almost done
up here.

1305
01:15:16,068 --> 01:15:18,401
I just need to get my books
from your office.

1306
01:15:18,403 --> 01:15:21,340
Yeah, I boxed them all up
last night.

1307
01:15:22,307 --> 01:15:24,044
Thanks for your help.

1308
01:15:26,912 --> 01:15:29,182
Did you get a spray tan?

1309
01:15:30,081 --> 01:15:31,683
No.

1310
01:15:32,550 --> 01:15:37,253
Jemima, had me at
"ski in, ski out."

1311
01:15:37,255 --> 01:15:40,923
I'll be there Friday.
No, I can't come Thursday.

1312
01:15:40,925 --> 01:15:42,993
I've got to see my lawyer.

1313
01:15:42,995 --> 01:15:46,163
Oh, just stupid stuff.

1314
01:15:46,165 --> 01:15:49,266
Yeah. You can have
all these bags.

1315
01:15:49,268 --> 01:15:51,068
I don't really need them.

1316
01:15:51,070 --> 01:15:54,937
Good.
Because they're mine.

1317
01:15:54,939 --> 01:15:56,543
Oh.

1318
01:16:03,982 --> 01:16:08,385
I... I think this might be
the best thing for both of us.

1319
01:16:08,387 --> 01:16:11,321
Well, we had a good run.

1320
01:16:11,323 --> 01:16:14,391
Oh, and remember to keep an eye
on the tile guy tomorrow.

1321
01:16:14,393 --> 01:16:16,493
I think
he's overbilling us.

1322
01:16:17,496 --> 01:16:19,029
I don't give a fuck
what you think

1323
01:16:19,031 --> 01:16:21,234
about the fucking tile guy,
you fucking cunt!

1324
01:16:22,401 --> 01:16:27,340
Oh. And you were
doing so well.

1325
01:17:04,242 --> 01:17:07,979
Please don't leave me.
I can't live without you.

1326
01:17:07,981 --> 01:17:09,646
Don't go.

1327
01:17:09,648 --> 01:17:12,984
Don't go, please,
please, please, please.

1328
01:17:12,986 --> 01:17:15,421
I love you.

1329
01:17:17,790 --> 01:17:21,361
I sure hope
he's not talking to me.

1330
01:17:34,439 --> 01:17:36,038
Keep driving.

1331
01:18:40,607 --> 01:18:42,575
Fuck!

1332
01:21:36,814 --> 01:21:41,086
And this motion will be accepted
by the court at this time.

1333
01:21:50,963 --> 01:21:53,096
The child shall remain
in the custody

1334
01:21:53,098 --> 01:21:57,702
of Erasmus Brumble
and Paul Morgan.

1335
01:21:59,504 --> 01:22:03,239
Oh, well, I must say,

1336
01:22:03,241 --> 01:22:08,444
all that courtroom melodrama
makes a man very hungry.

1337
01:22:08,446 --> 01:22:12,181
- How are you doing?
- I'm hungry, too.

1338
01:22:12,183 --> 01:22:14,454
So what shall we eat?

1339
01:22:23,062 --> 01:22:25,595
Let's not do a whole
thing tonight. I'm exhausted.

1340
01:22:25,597 --> 01:22:27,364
Why don't we just pick up
some sushi?

1341
01:22:27,366 --> 01:22:28,898
You know, supermarket sushi

1342
01:22:28,900 --> 01:22:31,168
is like God shitting
on mankind.

1343
01:22:31,170 --> 01:22:32,635
It is everything that
is wrong with this country.

1344
01:22:32,637 --> 01:22:34,136
I didn't say
supermarket sushi.

1345
01:22:34,138 --> 01:22:36,004
I've never had
supermarket sushi in my life.

1346
01:22:36,006 --> 01:22:38,240
Unless it was late at night
and I was blackout drunk

1347
01:22:38,242 --> 01:22:40,510
and I don't remember,
and that probably happened.

1348
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:42,579
I could make some sushi.
I did train

1349
01:22:42,581 --> 01:22:45,716
with one of the world's
leading sushi chefs.

1350
01:22:45,718 --> 01:22:47,551
That was at a demo
at Williams-Sonoma

1351
01:22:47,553 --> 01:22:49,352
in Albuquerque.
I was with you.

1352
01:22:49,354 --> 01:22:54,490
You know, your version
of events is so pedestrian.

1353
01:22:54,492 --> 01:22:56,193
Also known as reality.

1354
01:22:56,195 --> 01:22:58,061
Blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

1355
01:22:58,063 --> 01:23:00,663
Well, why don't we just do
a pasta at home?

1356
01:23:00,665 --> 01:23:02,132
I'm trying to avoid wheat
and dairy, Paul.

1357
01:23:02,134 --> 01:23:03,699
Oh, really,
is that since you had

1358
01:23:03,701 --> 01:23:06,168
the grilled cheese sandwich
for lunch?

1359
01:23:06,170 --> 01:23:07,937
It's a constant struggle.

1360
01:23:07,939 --> 01:23:11,673
Yes, it most
certainly is.

1361
01:23:11,675 --> 01:23:13,511
Guys.

1362
01:23:13,513 --> 01:23:15,278
Why don't you ask me
what I want for dinner?

1363
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:17,413
Well, we just assumed
it was Taco Bell.

1364
01:23:17,415 --> 01:23:19,682
No, I still love it,

1365
01:23:19,684 --> 01:23:22,785
but I'd like
something else tonight.

1366
01:23:22,787 --> 01:23:25,154
- Really?
- What would you like?

1367
01:23:25,156 --> 01:23:27,824
I'd like to have
pork tenderloin

1368
01:23:27,826 --> 01:23:32,095
with caramelized apples
and ginger.

1369
01:23:32,097 --> 01:23:33,062
What the hell?

1370
01:23:33,064 --> 01:23:35,535
What the fuck?

1371
01:23:36,469 --> 01:23:37,801
All right.

1372
01:23:37,803 --> 01:23:39,735
Let's get this kid
a pork tenderloin.

1373
01:23:39,737 --> 01:23:44,641
Maybe some polenta.
With goat cheese.

1374
01:23:44,643 --> 01:23:48,912
Oh, my God.
We've created a monster.

1375
01:23:48,914 --> 01:23:50,913
<i>I</i> created a monster.

1376
01:23:50,915 --> 01:23:53,449
No, you <i>are</i> a monster.

1377
01:23:53,451 --> 01:23:56,886
And now I have to contend
with two of you. Good God.

1378
01:23:58,924 --> 01:24:01,490
Oh, Jesus.

1379
01:24:01,492 --> 01:24:05,261
There's a fucking rainbow.

1380
