1
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:15,701
How come your doctor
back home allowed

2
00:01:15,785 --> 00:01:18,035
so much time after the first surgery?

3
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,830
No, I just felt that…

4
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:22,634
it would be too painful to go
through another operation back then.

5
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:25,496
Keep your head straight, child.

6
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:26,633
You mean emotionally?

7
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:27,132
Yeah.

8
00:01:27,213 --> 00:01:29,973
Besides it's also rare for people
to donate eyes back home.

9
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:32,298
Religious prejudice?

10
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:49,609
Is this the coughing man?

11
00:02:01,372 --> 00:02:02,872
Are you going to do anything about it?

12
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:04,541
Yeah.

13
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:15,468
What are you doing?

14
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:20,348
That looks nice.

15
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:21,852
But which one do you like better?

16
00:02:21,976 --> 00:02:23,136
This one or…
- Edit

17
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:25,935
Undo
- this one?

18
00:02:27,273 --> 00:02:28,273
Show me again.

19
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:29,649
Edit

20
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:32,068
Redo

21
00:02:32,153 --> 00:02:33,953
Hmm… that looks better.

22
00:02:35,281 --> 00:02:36,411
Do you want the background so dark?

23
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:38,032
Yeah.

24
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:08,484
Maysoon said you've been
featured in today's Al Haram.

25
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:11,026
Yeah, they did a phone interview.

26
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:13,824
I am so excited!
I wish I could be present.

27
00:03:13,903 --> 00:03:16,323
I'll send you pictures and
videos from the exhibition.

28
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:21,538
Is he coming?
- Is who coming?

29
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:25,248
Of course, he is!
Mom, come on!

30
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:28,459
I won't put my
bets on a man…

31
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:32,302
who lives in the same city as his daughter
and sees her ten times in two years!

32
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:34,511
You say these things about
each other…

33
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,260
and then behave like
everything is normal…

34
00:03:37,343 --> 00:03:39,803
laughing and bitching
like teenagers!

35
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:45,389
That's a healthy romantic idea
you have about your parents.

36
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:49,097
Vinay, hello dear!
- Hi Hala!

37
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:50,980
How are you?

38
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:53,976
I'm Okay. I'm Okay.

39
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:59,491
Is grunge in again?
- Grunge? Well, I'm just lazy.

40
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:03,485
You never sent me the animation you made.
- Oh, I'll send it to you… very soon.

41
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:08,003
And have you recorded any new songs?
- Yeah, we did. I'll send them across too.

42
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:14,883
And how is your Arabic?
- Pink. Fantastic. What-the-hell!

43
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,296
I'm working on it.

44
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:25,656
How is your mother?

45
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,910
She is very good.
She sends her regards.

46
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:30,291
Uncle, what are these?

47
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:34,838
Those are bamboos.
They hold the building together.

48
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:37,884
They are holding the building together?
- Yeah.

49
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:39,337
How come?

50
00:05:46,764 --> 00:05:49,524
Bright orange. Deep yellow.

51
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,060
Bright orange

52
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:05,656
Red.

53
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:07,617
What?

54
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:10,409
I was just seeing where you are.

55
00:06:12,331 --> 00:06:13,331
Red.

56
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,040
Aunty, is this glass?

57
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,460
Yes.

58
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:19,553
I'll close it for a second okay?

59
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,259
And I just hung around in their house
and explored the spaces…

60
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:27,757
and I let them just be
as they were and…

61
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,430
then I was really intrigued by the kid.
He was really friendly and…

62
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:35,563
I just kept following him and that's when
one of those pictures was clicked.

63
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:39,351
So, you mentioned in your website
that you actually took up photography…

64
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:43,726
after you lost your eyesight to
a cornea infection. -Yeah, true.

65
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:44,941
Why photography?

66
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,860
Well, first to document,
archive, and remember.

67
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:52,026
Then, to kind of… explore,
understand and see.

68
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:55,373
So, I guess all art evolves from
a need to record the apparent…

69
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:56,792
to a need to capture the essence?

70
00:08:57,037 --> 00:09:00,457
That's very well put. I mean that's
exactly how it's been for me.

71
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,290
When I first started
taking pictures…

72
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:06,798
I was very much amused by the character
of the perfumer in Suskind's novel.

73
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:10,878
Just the idea of a man trying
to capture every scent…

74
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:14,298
starting from people to
surroundings to experiences.

75
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:15,846
You know, it was very
much amusing.

76
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,680
That's a very
interesting analogy.

77
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:20,516
Why black and white?

78
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:23,976
It just gives me more control
over the elements of my pictures.

79
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:26,276
But do you ever feel
limited by anything?

80
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,237
Umm… No!

81
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:31,492
That's… that's amazing.

82
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:39,082
Is it? I mean… why is it so amazing
to not have limits or doubts?

83
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:44,421
Honestly, I just can't wait to begin
my life as a photographer.

84
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:48,961
But you are a photographer…
I mean, you're a good photographer!

85
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:07,690
Hello!

86
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:10,691
Hi!
- Hi.

87
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:12,899
Is that your house?
- Yes!

88
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:16,485
So, I hear ducks, and lots of
animals. Are they inside?

89
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,700
Yes.

90
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:42,979
Orlando! Are you ready?

91
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:43,731
Yeah.

92
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:45,652
Aunty, can you start splashing?

93
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:53,696
I will take the pictures from there,
okay?

94
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:57,617
And I just want you to splash
the water on this side.

95
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,168
Yeah, this one is quite an image.

96
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:11,919
Alright, there's a very
small pond at the bottom.

97
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:14,088
And…

98
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:17,836
there are four ducks swimming
in four opposite directions.

99
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:23,016
And the one in the center is frozen in
the middle of its flapping of the wings.

100
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,440
There's one sitting at the corner
of the pond, away from us.

101
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:28,188
It's wet.

102
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:31,109
And there's one flying in to
the frame from the right,

103
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:33,033
and one flying in
to it from the left.

104
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:35,896
Wait, it's actually a pair.

105
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,197
And the woman?

106
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:41,407
Oh, she's right
behind the pond.

107
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:45,162
standing upright…

108
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:48,674
looking towards the top left
corner of the image.

109
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:54,259
And… she is splashing
water in the same direction as well.

110
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:57,512
She's got some sort of a
contraption on her left hand.

111
00:11:57,718 --> 00:11:59,428
Yeah… it was sprained.

112
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,970
Well, it's giving her character.

113
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:05,734
And what about the background?

114
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:08,805
There are a lot of
trees in the background.

115
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:11,936
Small house…
with a gable roof.

116
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:14,108
Gable roof?

117
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,283
A sloped roof.

118
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:21,243
And what about the light?

119
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:25,204
I like the way the light is falling.
It's sort of angular,

120
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:26,867
coming down from
top left and behind.

121
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:30,752
I think the background would have
looked better with lesser elements.

122
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:38,843
It's just too crowded
at the moment, I think.

123
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,850
Also, there are yellow pillow cases.

124
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:43,929
Yellow?

125
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:48,561
Yeah. It doesn't work as well in
black & white as it does in color.

126
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:51,097
Why were you looking
at the colored version?

127
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:53,111
I was curious.

128
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:56,565
Okay, so will you vectorize
it please?

129
00:12:58,195 --> 00:13:02,775
It doesn't work as well with
all the elements in the image…

130
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:04,531
to be brought down to a line drawing.

131
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:07,286
Yeah, I know I'd miss most of the
details. I'd still like to see it though.

132
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,370
Sure. Yeah.

133
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:10,786
Do you want to see another one?

134
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,560
Stop… Stop!
Reverse… Reverse.

135
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:15,564
See, there's one where
the guy in the right side…

136
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:17,939
is actually being covered by
a passing rickshaw.

137
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:20,444
And you can only
see his…

138
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:25,818
right hand pointing
accusingly at the other guy.

139
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:28,117
I think that's the one. It looks nice.
- No, leave it.

140
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:29,618
What?

141
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,620
Why?

142
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,870
Doesn't sound exciting to me.

143
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,785
But… It's a crazy moment here.
It's nice.

144
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:40,878
Will you start making the sauce?
It'll be forever before we eat.

145
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,550
All I am saying is that
it's a very good image.

146
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:46,759
It's accidental.

147
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:50,272
Oh, please! Don't start that again.
- Don't start the "don't start again".

148
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,524
All I am saying is
you don't have to

149
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:54,481
be in conscious control of
your art all the time.

150
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,651
You can be intuitive.
- It is intuitive.

151
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:58,691
I am not writing intellectually
stimulating essays here.

152
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:01,153
I am very much aware I am
just taking pictures.

153
00:15:01,318 --> 00:15:02,648
Well, then?
- Then what?

154
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:05,157
What's your problem?
- I don't have one.

155
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:06,278
What's your problem with
this picture?

156
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:08,624
I don't even know this picture.
What's your hang-up?

157
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:10,662
Look, I just feel
you're throwing away…

158
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:13,204
a brilliant piece of your art
just because of a stupid hang-up.

159
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:16,288
I don't like it. That's why I am
dumping it. Is that fair enough for you?

160
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,166
Okay, let me just give you
a perfect description, alright?

161
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:22,418
Let's vectorize or etch it…

162
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:25,925
and write a piece of poem to capture
the essence, and then you decide.

163
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:27,757
No.
- What "no"?

164
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,850
Listen, these are the things
I depend on, right?

165
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:35,061
I have to draw opinion and assurance
about my own art from what others say.

166
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:36,853
Yes, but you've continued
to produce great work…

167
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:38,017
Says who?

168
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:38,774
Says everybody.

169
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:41,225
Who the hell is everybody?
Everyone is so fucking stupid.

170
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:44,736
They watch stupid soap operas.
They fight over religion and ideas.

171
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:45,608
What are we arguing about?

172
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:46,947
Okay, I'll tell you what…

173
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:49,118
Remember the other day at
my parents' when…

174
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,829
Uncle Kumar was talking about
the orchestra I shot for?

175
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,290
Remember what he said?
- That he thought they were alright, so?

176
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:56,672
No no. He said something
to the effect of…

177
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:59,211
that he was wondering whether
it was the music…

178
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,502
Let me finish first.

179
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:02,920
What's it got to do
with Kumar Uncle anyway?

180
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:04,053
Let me finish my sentence!

181
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,550
You don't even know what I am going to say.
- Okay, make the point.

182
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:08,343
I know where this is going…
- NO!

183
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:10,796
So, fight alone then… if you
already know where it is going.

184
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:11,927
Okay, what did he say?

185
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:13,715
Okay, he said something
to the effect of…

186
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:15,975
that he didn't know whether it
was the music that was being

187
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:17,307
celebrated or the fact that
they were all blind.

188
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:19,274
I knew that you were going
to say this. I was there.

189
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:20,364
He didn't say anything
like that.

190
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,770
Fine! Good for you.
I was hallucinating!

191
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:25,355
Besides, why would he say
something like that?

192
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:26,817
Why are you being so obtuse?

193
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:29,952
I am being obtuse?
That's very nice!

194
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:32,784
No… I can't understand why

195
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:35,617
each time I have doubts…
- I don't want to go there…

196
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:38,294
Exactly! Just being a lesser
dramatic will help!

197
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,630
Every time it doesn't have
to be this drama.

198
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:44,753
I am just so fucking scared of what
will trigger off…

199
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:47,048
another unending phase of
painful introspection…

200
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:50,392
and I'll be left outside, guessing
what the fuck you're going through.

201
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:55,637
You're stifling me all the time
by being so fucking scared.

202
00:16:58,268 --> 00:16:59,768
I wish you hadn't said that.

203
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:02,688
Why are you taking this personally?
It's not about you.

204
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:04,359
Okay. Alright.

205
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:08,526
Let's take it easy then. You don't want this
picture for whatever reason, right?

206
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:10,025
It's fine.

207
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:11,735
I'll just put it in the
memory box, so that we

208
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:13,873
can look back at what
we were fighting about.

209
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:16,409
If you wish. I have no such illusions.
- What?

210
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:20,078
Why are you doing this!?
- What am I doing? I don't get it.

211
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,338
Why did you get so
hard suddenly?

212
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:30,631
Let me in.

213
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:40,809
You know your work is good.
- How?

214
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:43,096
Baby, please!

215
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,650
Do not patronize me, okay?

216
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,901
How was the meeting with the Kisstens?

217
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:35,493
I went shopping with them today.

218
00:18:35,907 --> 00:18:38,827
I got you a very nice dress.

219
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:41,959
Yaallah! Berlin is crazy.

220
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,130
You have to see it.
- I will, one day.

221
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:47,129
Of course, dear.

222
00:18:47,502 --> 00:18:50,382
Mom, do you remember?
We had once gone

223
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:53,053
to Fayoum when I was small,
and just near the Nile…

224
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:56,973
Nile? It was a lake, dear.

225
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:59,723
Yeah. Same thing.

226
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:02,853
Anyway, there was a swan cart, okay…
- There was what?

227
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:04,518
A swan cart!

228
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:06,765
A swan cart?

229
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:09,399
I know this sounds ridiculous,
but I have a vivid memory of it.

230
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,402
You know how you doubt sometimes,
if what you remember…

231
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:15,704
is your own experience, some dream
or something somebody told you…

232
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:20,410
that you pictured it so well that
it became your own memory.

233
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:22,871
Strange things you remember.

234
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:27,165
Hang on, I am getting a
call from the hospital.

235
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:32,424
Hello?
- Aliya! Aliya!

236
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:35,585
Yeah… that's me.

237
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:42,853
Yeah, I'll be right there.
Thank you so much!

238
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:44,224
Momma!

239
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:49,312
I got a call from the hospital.
They're ready for the operation.

240
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:51,191
Ready for what?

241
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:53,362
The operation Mom!
Just call up Dad and Vinay.

242
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:54,903
Tell them to meet
me at the hospital.

243
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:57,946
Okay! I will come
down soon, as well.

244
00:19:58,031 --> 00:20:02,371
Okay! Just call them quickly and tell
them to hurry… don't forget!

245
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:30,733
Slowly open your eyes.

246
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:32,147
Open.

247
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,359
Open your eyes…
slowly. Very good!

248
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,111
Don't squeeze.

249
00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:43,155
Slowly keep them open.
Open wide.

250
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:46,785
Open both your eyes wide.
Very nice… very good!

251
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:48,618
Open it completely.

252
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:50,792
Can you see something?

253
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:19,945
Very nice.

254
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,458
You didn't sign up for this

255
00:25:23,356 --> 00:25:26,396
The graft that we had put in
is completely clear.

256
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:29,195
It's beautiful.

257
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:31,777
Let's look at the other eye.

258
00:25:35,618 --> 00:25:38,368
Left eye is the one which
we did first, right?

259
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:40,330
Good!

260
00:25:41,541 --> 00:25:45,171
The left eye is very nice.
The graft is totally clear.

261
00:25:46,546 --> 00:25:51,006
It's even difficult to
tell that you have new eyes.

262
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:23,623
It's changed a lot.
Don't you think?

263
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,730
I have to go.

264
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:44,189
Sir… excuse me!

265
00:26:44,604 --> 00:26:47,824
Can I take few pictures of you?
Here? Two minutes.

266
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:05,169
Could you look outside?

267
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:43,953
A frog once asked a centipede how is
it able to walk on a hundred feet…

268
00:27:44,038 --> 00:27:45,458
so gracefully synchronized…

269
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:48,001
while the frog finds it
difficult to manage even two.

270
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:50,797
The centipede took a moment to
analyze its own walk…

271
00:27:50,878 --> 00:27:52,048
and was baffled.

272
00:27:52,129 --> 00:27:54,089
So… as it tried to walk further…

273
00:27:54,507 --> 00:27:56,627
its feet got entangled and
it tripped.

274
00:28:08,062 --> 00:28:09,312
No, no, no, no…

275
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:13,029
What? They are good pictures.
- No, I don't like them.

276
00:28:13,484 --> 00:28:14,484
What are you doing?

277
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:15,527
Oye!

278
00:28:17,697 --> 00:28:18,817
You can't just delete that!

279
00:32:00,461 --> 00:32:01,751
That's very dramatic.

280
00:32:03,923 --> 00:32:05,513
Have you seen the images?

281
00:32:06,175 --> 00:32:07,545
Yes, they're good.

282
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:15,558
Good?

283
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:17,518
Yeah!

284
00:32:18,479 --> 00:32:20,149
I think I really like
them by now.

285
00:32:28,072 --> 00:32:29,412
How did your lecture go?

286
00:32:31,033 --> 00:32:33,293
I think I should focus
on my book rather than

287
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:35,195
wasting my time on lecture tours.

288
00:32:38,082 --> 00:32:39,332
Should we get ready in
an hour?

289
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,790
Could you please call
them and cancel?

290
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:43,836
Sure.

291
00:32:46,382 --> 00:32:48,182
What? You didn't even protest.

292
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:50,261
Have you given up on me or what?

293
00:32:52,012 --> 00:32:53,012
Of course not, baby!

294
00:32:53,514 --> 00:32:55,314
You can take your time
with the blindfold.

295
00:33:02,272 --> 00:33:05,732
I can't just put it on before I take a
shot and then take it off, right?

296
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:07,151
Yeah.

297
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:09,569
But, you've seen the
pictures. It really works!

298
00:33:12,533 --> 00:33:14,453
Could you please tell me
what you really think?

299
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:16,245
Like what?

300
00:33:18,706 --> 00:33:20,706
That it's a naive and
a stupid fixation.

301
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:25,208
Yes, its naive, stupid, childish
and absolutely ridiculous.

302
00:33:25,963 --> 00:33:27,843
I think I just want to
go somewhere…

303
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:30,930
… somewhere inspiring.

304
00:33:32,219 --> 00:33:33,719
With that?
- No.

305
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:44,189
You know I've been
doing some research…

306
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:48,031
and I came across amazing work,
that just left me overwhelmed.

307
00:33:48,652 --> 00:33:50,492
There are a lot of
photographers who stage…

308
00:33:50,571 --> 00:33:52,701
elaborate scenes,
costumes, lights…

309
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:56,623
and I think this just gives them
a sense of purpose.

310
00:33:56,994 --> 00:33:59,504
Or else you'd just be
waiting there to be lucky right.

311
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,710
Probably at the right place.

312
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:03,582
I mean, even then

313
00:34:03,751 --> 00:34:05,881
I really wonder what
inner skill you need…

314
00:34:06,045 --> 00:34:07,795
… to have a great moment
around you…

315
00:34:08,047 --> 00:34:10,337
and the clicking of your
camera come together.

316
00:34:12,676 --> 00:34:15,256
But there must be something
beyond that as well.

317
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:17,555
Like beyond taking the picture?
- Yeah.

318
00:40:57,289 --> 00:40:58,999
Now that you have saved its life

319
00:40:59,082 --> 00:41:02,132
will you also give it a proper
upbringing and a good education?

320
00:41:05,505 --> 00:41:08,295
What if it was the worm's karma
to just lie there and get crushed?

321
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:11,603
Well, is it lying there getting crushed?
So, perhaps, it wasn't.

322
00:41:12,304 --> 00:41:14,684
Or worse, the worm was trying
to commit suicide…

323
00:41:15,265 --> 00:41:19,515
and you've put it in the pot, and now it
has to crawl it's way back to nirvana.

324
00:41:21,021 --> 00:41:22,361
Do you believe in our case…?

325
00:41:22,522 --> 00:41:25,362
I am sorry I didn't get your name…
- Charvaka!

326
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:27,025
Really? Your parents named you that?

327
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:30,990
No. My parents named me Madhava after
the great theologist Madhavacharya.

328
00:41:31,573 --> 00:41:33,703
But I decided to switch sides
at the age of fourteen.

329
00:41:35,702 --> 00:41:38,212
Yeah. I do believe in our
case, but I am here…

330
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:42,753
to learn to win an
argument from both sides.

331
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:44,588
We are…
- Okay, we got to go.

332
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:46,839
We are all blind men trying
to perceive the elephant.

333
00:41:47,297 --> 00:41:49,717
How are you blind?
You're wearing glasses.

334
00:41:50,467 --> 00:41:54,677
Serial number 4, writ
petition 212 of 2010.

335
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:57,720
Ladyship, please.
I appear on behalf of the petitioner.

336
00:41:57,807 --> 00:42:00,347
I appear on behalf of
respondent number 1.

337
00:42:00,477 --> 00:42:03,767
Yes, Mr. Gupta, a meat-eating lawyer
for an animal rights case?

338
00:42:04,064 --> 00:42:06,194
My client has made me
change my ways.

339
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:08,820
Okay, what is this matter about?

340
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:12,490
Well, this is about testing of
chemicals on animals.

341
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:17,371
Pharmaceuticals companies in India
are constantly violating animal rights.

342
00:42:17,494 --> 00:42:22,004
Every ethical and scientific research
points to this having to stop.

343
00:42:22,832 --> 00:42:24,792
I know that may not
be possible now

344
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:28,510
but what we are looking
at is the…

345
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:32,128
complete elimination of cosmetic
and non-essential research.

346
00:42:32,175 --> 00:42:35,595
Okay, okay. That calls for a larger debate.
Who's appearing for the board?

347
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:39,430
Your ladyship, we monitor
467 laboratories, overall.

348
00:42:39,641 --> 00:42:42,731
And the report submitted by them
has been as per the guidelines.

349
00:42:42,852 --> 00:42:46,522
It is very difficult for us to monitor
this on a day-to-day basis.

350
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:49,396
These are my humble submissions
to this honorable court.

351
00:42:49,943 --> 00:42:53,743
My Lord, if this is the response of
the board then what remains in this petition?

352
00:42:54,531 --> 00:42:58,991
Public interest litigation nowadays, has
become more like "publicity" interest litigation.

353
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,830
and this petition should be
rejected at this stage.

354
00:43:01,871 --> 00:43:04,961
Okay, okay. We'll hear from you, Mr. Gupta.
- Very well.

355
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:08,253
The question is that animals
which are kept in laboratories…

356
00:43:08,336 --> 00:43:10,126
… they are treated completely ruthlessly.

357
00:43:10,213 --> 00:43:13,883
They're to be killed, they are to die,
and they are treated as dead.

358
00:43:13,967 --> 00:43:15,637
They are kept in cramped spaces

359
00:43:15,677 --> 00:43:17,677
they fight with each other,
they hurt each other.

360
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:19,642
They get burnt, they get cut up

361
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:21,774
they suffer from diarrhea, paralysis…

362
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,520
the conditions are despicable!

363
00:43:23,685 --> 00:43:26,515
In fact, my learned friend
is not accurately instructed.

364
00:43:26,646 --> 00:43:30,776
We've recently installed air-conditioning
and ten by ten cages for these animals.

365
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:33,492
Yes, but then you cram ten animals
in those ten by ten cages!

366
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:35,160
Well, that's certainly more luxury than

367
00:43:35,238 --> 00:43:37,618
a commuter enjoys on a
suburban train in Mumbai!

368
00:43:37,741 --> 00:43:39,281
That was not warranted, Mr. Dastoor!

369
00:43:39,492 --> 00:43:41,202
What I was trying to submit was…

370
00:43:41,578 --> 00:43:43,498
that there are many
more pressing issues

371
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:45,830
which the court should
concern themselves with…

372
00:43:45,915 --> 00:43:47,955
rather than this sentimental petition.

373
00:43:48,668 --> 00:43:49,918
Okay, we'll hear from Mr. Gupta.

374
00:43:50,378 --> 00:43:52,458
My Lord, the point really
is that molecules are

375
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:55,047
required to be tested on
animals before they are

376
00:43:55,425 --> 00:43:56,675
used on human beings.

377
00:43:57,427 --> 00:43:58,597
Well, I don't know about that,

378
00:43:58,678 --> 00:44:00,098
because there's severe criticism

379
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:03,480
of that within the
scientific community itself.

380
00:44:03,933 --> 00:44:05,733
Today, we have stem-cell research

381
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:08,400
we have computer based research…
there are many other options.

382
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:12,570
The point we are dealing with is the
conditions in which these animals are kept

383
00:44:12,651 --> 00:44:14,321
and how they are treated.

384
00:45:00,824 --> 00:45:03,704
So I hear your Guruji is in Boston now.

385
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:08,919
He, like our beloved Maitreya, is
more an academic, less a monk.

386
00:45:09,416 --> 00:45:12,536
The fringe benefits of knowing English.

387
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:17,632
The poster for the anti-leather campaign.
- Aah. It's good.

388
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:20,469
Nice. Just cut down on
the sentimentality a bit.

389
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,760
We must address people's reason more.

390
00:45:26,808 --> 00:45:28,938
Have you forgotten your promise?

391
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:35,187
It was your wish to sponsor a
community center for my guru.

392
00:45:35,859 --> 00:45:37,569
Wasn't it?

393
00:45:38,695 --> 00:45:42,695
All of you are so self absorbed.

394
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:46,747
You have forgotten your duties.

395
00:45:50,623 --> 00:45:52,923
That's why I am reminding you

396
00:45:53,752 --> 00:45:58,672
of your promises of sponsorship

397
00:45:59,632 --> 00:46:04,802
and processions with great pomp.

398
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:09,060
I will be a committed devotee,
once my son gets married.

399
00:46:09,309 --> 00:46:10,769
Shall we start?
- Yes… yes.

400
00:46:11,102 --> 00:46:16,232
Even Mr. Mahesh wishes to contribute.

401
00:46:17,066 --> 00:46:19,896
Feel free to start!

402
00:46:28,077 --> 00:46:34,327
There are no celestial beings I know of.

403
00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:38,514
There is no god either.

404
00:46:38,546 --> 00:46:42,126
Neither heaven, nor hell.

405
00:46:42,675 --> 00:46:48,055
Neither a preserver, nor an
owner of this universe.

406
00:46:49,891 --> 00:46:57,521
Neither a creator nor a destroyer.
No eternal judge.

407
00:46:58,525 --> 00:47:04,105
There is only the law of causality.

408
00:47:04,405 --> 00:47:14,395
I take responsibility for my actions
and their consequences.

409
00:47:16,543 --> 00:47:22,053
The smallest of creatures have
a life-force just like mine.

410
00:47:22,549 --> 00:47:30,429
May I always have such compassion.
May I never cause any harm to anybody.

411
00:47:30,932 --> 00:47:36,192
The truth is multi-faceted, and
there are many ways to reach it.

412
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:42,898
May I find balance in this duality.

413
00:47:43,486 --> 00:47:47,066
I pray, may my karma of ignorance be shed.

414
00:47:47,156 --> 00:47:55,456
May my true self be liberated from
the cycle of life and death.

415
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:56,920
And attain moksha.

416
00:48:18,187 --> 00:48:20,267
So, I hear you are
a writer of jokes…

417
00:48:20,899 --> 00:48:23,279
No, as in, I have a stand-up
act which I write myself.

418
00:48:23,401 --> 00:48:26,531
Say something funny!
- That's like me saying, say something deep.

419
00:48:26,946 --> 00:48:27,946
I can be deep.

420
00:48:28,156 --> 00:48:33,946
See, once a monk went to a sandwich seller
and asked him, make me one with all!

421
00:48:37,832 --> 00:48:39,542
I have one which is
equally terrible.

422
00:48:39,709 --> 00:48:41,919
Which email can attain cyber
enlightenment?

423
00:48:42,128 --> 00:48:43,498
What does that mean?

424
00:48:45,465 --> 00:48:46,465
Which?

425
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:47,927
One that has no attachments!

426
00:48:49,302 --> 00:48:52,972
I'm sorry, I'm just in this phase
of life where I find

427
00:48:53,264 --> 00:48:56,184
everything that comes with no
attachments rather fascinating.

428
00:48:56,976 --> 00:48:58,806
I read your book, by the way.
It was engaging.

429
00:48:58,895 --> 00:48:59,975
Oh! Thank you for reading it.

430
00:49:00,063 --> 00:49:02,273
I didn't buy it of course.
One of my friends lent it to me.

431
00:49:02,398 --> 00:49:05,028
But I have a few apprehensions.
- That's a good thing. Tell me.

432
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:08,200
Like I haven't read
the entire thing, but…

433
00:49:08,696 --> 00:49:10,486
the hundred and fifty
pages that I have read…

434
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:17,160
you say you're an atheist, and at the same
time you believe in the concept of soul

435
00:49:17,538 --> 00:49:18,958
which I think is rather convenient.

436
00:49:19,332 --> 00:49:24,052
I don't think karmic causality is a reason
enough for anybody to behave ethically.

437
00:49:24,963 --> 00:49:28,093
You know, that there is
retribution of any kind

438
00:49:28,716 --> 00:49:30,636
in this life or any other

439
00:49:32,428 --> 00:49:35,638
It's like a weak man's hope for
some kind of cosmic revenge.

440
00:49:35,848 --> 00:49:39,348
I agree with you. It's very easy to believe
in something out of fear and guilt.

441
00:49:39,477 --> 00:49:40,057
Correct!

442
00:49:40,186 --> 00:49:43,306
All ethics must be arrived at in
isolation of religious beliefs.

443
00:49:43,731 --> 00:49:46,281
But are you able to practice that?
- I hope I am.

444
00:49:49,779 --> 00:49:51,819
Why do monks beg alms?

445
00:49:52,907 --> 00:49:55,277
Because hunger drives the world.

446
00:49:56,661 --> 00:49:58,251
And once that's out of the way

447
00:49:58,329 --> 00:50:00,039
there are more important
things we can focus on.

448
00:50:00,123 --> 00:50:02,673
And also, it makes me
more patient and humble.

449
00:50:03,001 --> 00:50:04,251
Humble?
- Yes!

450
00:50:04,836 --> 00:50:05,836
Why?

451
00:50:06,254 --> 00:50:07,964
So will you be begging
my boss for food?

452
00:50:08,047 --> 00:50:10,877
No… but why did you
snigger at "humble"?

453
00:50:12,635 --> 00:50:13,925
I remembered something.

454
00:50:14,595 --> 00:50:17,135
No, rituals are symbolic theater. Once you
have accepted the symbol

455
00:50:17,223 --> 00:50:18,523
or the truth behind the symbol

456
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:21,099
there is no need to stress
on it all the time.

457
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:24,809
And you're expecting more people
to follow your religion?

458
00:50:25,064 --> 00:50:27,944
No, I am on no such mission.
- Okay, your ideas.

459
00:50:28,401 --> 00:50:29,691
Yes, I like to share them

460
00:50:30,111 --> 00:50:34,031
and see what comes out of it, but not
in religious discourses and conferences.

461
00:50:34,365 --> 00:50:37,575
I like to share them with the
political and scientific mainstream.

462
00:50:38,786 --> 00:50:41,206
Something like the Copenhagen
Climate Change Summit?

463
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:43,209
Yes. Why not?

464
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:45,793
And will you walk to Copenhagen?

465
00:50:46,044 --> 00:50:47,054
Of course!

466
00:50:47,295 --> 00:50:52,585
Or you could keep walking inside
the plane, that way you'll reach…

467
00:50:56,846 --> 00:50:59,306
Ah, so you've found yourself
a new protege?

468
00:50:59,348 --> 00:51:01,638
Ah, he's the master.

469
00:51:04,145 --> 00:51:05,975
So, how did the interview go?

470
00:51:06,189 --> 00:51:07,609
Interview?

471
00:51:08,691 --> 00:51:11,281
He was on a talk show yesterday.
- Live? Did I miss something?

472
00:51:11,569 --> 00:51:13,149
No, not really.

473
00:51:13,613 --> 00:51:15,323
It's going to be broadcast
in a month or so, isn't it?

474
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:19,656
Yes, it all started with the same assumption
of me being a naive romantic

475
00:51:19,744 --> 00:51:22,414
who is trying to imagine that the
world will turn vegan overnight.

476
00:51:22,538 --> 00:51:23,658
Well, don't you?

477
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:25,540
Come on, who has these delusions?

478
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:29,250
All that we have demanded is a
practical, reasonable, scientific

479
00:51:29,337 --> 00:51:31,507
change in the system so that
we can lessen suffering.

480
00:51:31,631 --> 00:51:34,381
You know, I secretly share
a part of their cynicism.

481
00:51:34,967 --> 00:51:36,587
I mean, does our case really hold?

482
00:51:36,761 --> 00:51:39,891
We're asking them to make the
cages bigger, to better the hygiene

483
00:51:40,014 --> 00:51:41,774
to stop the force feeding,
the torture

484
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:44,849
but how does it make sense because they
are all going to be butchered in the end?

485
00:51:44,936 --> 00:51:47,356
But let their lives be
better than their death.

486
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:49,358
Yes. And just because they are
marked for slaughter

487
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,690
doesn't mean you abuse and torture them.
What kind of logic is that?

488
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:54,278
Tenzing Rinpoche was there yesterday.
- Really?

489
00:51:54,362 --> 00:51:56,322
Yes. And I am joining him for the
Peace March next month.

490
00:51:56,405 --> 00:51:59,365
Oh yes, I heard they are protesting against
the visit of a Chinese ambassador.

491
00:51:59,492 --> 00:52:01,242
Yes, they are.

492
00:52:01,577 --> 00:52:02,787
What are you trying to do?

493
00:52:03,538 --> 00:52:06,748
Jagannath told me you had severe
pain in the abdomen yesterday.

494
00:52:07,458 --> 00:52:08,918
Why are you looking at him?

495
00:52:09,127 --> 00:52:10,877
You have loose motions as well?
- Nothing!

496
00:52:11,003 --> 00:52:12,633
And don't fool me into shelling
out money now.

497
00:52:12,713 --> 00:52:14,343
You don't have any. Just lie down.

498
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:15,800
Mr. Gupta! How are you?

499
00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:23,220
I've got your book.
The one you had ordered.

500
00:52:23,975 --> 00:52:25,265
Your liver is slightly enlarged.

501
00:52:25,351 --> 00:52:29,941
What is this discount for?
- It's for all my customers.

502
00:52:30,815 --> 00:52:32,855
Will you take medicines?
- No.

503
00:52:34,694 --> 00:52:37,864
Okay, only if it will be necessary.
- Yes, it will be.

504
00:52:44,162 --> 00:52:46,872
Thank you Mr. Mehta.
- Thank you very much.

505
00:53:08,769 --> 00:53:10,399
Who invited you here today?

506
00:53:11,606 --> 00:53:16,936
I'm not here to see you.
I have other friends here.

507
00:53:25,995 --> 00:53:27,865
It's very good.

508
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:29,959
Can I stop taking medicines now?

509
00:53:30,041 --> 00:53:34,881
Let the course complete.

510
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:49,770
Here's your magazine.

511
00:53:54,482 --> 00:53:57,402
Oh, wow… thank you!

512
00:53:57,985 --> 00:53:58,985
How are you feeling?

513
00:53:59,445 --> 00:54:00,735
I'm better after taking
the herbal decoction.

514
00:54:00,821 --> 00:54:02,281
Decoction? What about the medicines?

515
00:54:02,531 --> 00:54:04,081
There was no need for medicines.

516
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:06,490
I'll have to shut shop this way.

517
00:54:07,203 --> 00:54:08,753
See you later.
- Sit for a bit.

518
00:54:08,871 --> 00:54:11,121
Can't. Too much work.

519
00:54:12,333 --> 00:54:14,923
He says he's better with the herbs.

520
00:54:15,002 --> 00:54:16,882
What can we do?

521
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:41,739
Sir, this case will take forever.

522
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:44,030
We have our ways of doing things

523
00:54:44,115 --> 00:54:47,325
but I want to avoid
unpleasant situations.

524
00:54:47,952 --> 00:54:53,042
We'd be happy to make a donation to
a charity on your behalf.

525
00:54:54,375 --> 00:54:55,995
You know what you need to do.

526
00:56:17,792 --> 00:56:19,132
It's what I was afraid of.

527
00:56:20,544 --> 00:56:21,594
Liver cirrhosis.

528
00:56:22,505 --> 00:56:23,755
What's that? Cancer?

529
00:56:24,173 --> 00:56:25,803
No, it's not cancer.

530
00:56:26,842 --> 00:56:29,432
Cancer can be one of the
complications of cirrhosis.

531
00:56:29,804 --> 00:56:31,564
But we won't worry
about that at this stage.

532
00:56:31,639 --> 00:56:33,349
How much of the truth
will you tell me?

533
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:34,979
The whole truth.

534
00:56:36,018 --> 00:56:39,978
So, should I prepare to end up here soon?
- No, nothing like that.

535
00:56:40,439 --> 00:56:44,359
See, cirrhosis has reached an
advanced stage.

536
00:56:45,111 --> 00:56:48,821
We'll be focusing on preventing
complications and getting a transplant.

537
00:56:49,532 --> 00:56:52,082
Transplant?
- Yes. It's imperative.

538
00:56:55,496 --> 00:56:57,036
That means lots of medication?

539
00:56:57,248 --> 00:56:58,248
Yes.

540
00:56:58,290 --> 00:56:59,420
Of what kind?

541
00:58:30,674 --> 00:58:32,094
Jagannath, bring me the list please.

542
00:58:32,635 --> 00:58:35,135
You can have them. Dr. Bhargava
has prescribed these.

543
00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:37,220
Just bring me the list.

544
00:59:12,132 --> 00:59:13,972
It has three equivalents here.

545
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:15,800
It's a very old list.

546
00:59:17,221 --> 00:59:18,391
We'll deal with it tomorrow.

547
00:59:43,831 --> 00:59:48,001
All the jungles have disappeared

548
00:59:49,962 --> 00:59:55,882
And we are trapped in cages

549
00:59:57,678 --> 00:59:59,758
It's going well!
- Thank you.

550
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:02,470
They are traveling around with it.
- Ah! Okay.

551
01:00:03,559 --> 01:00:09,229
I just wanted a fresh list of all the
companies that have not yet signed on the

552
01:00:09,982 --> 01:00:11,482
Illegal Treatment to Animals Act.

553
01:00:11,609 --> 01:00:13,109
There isn't a single
pharmaceutical company,

554
01:00:13,193 --> 01:00:15,363
that doesn't violate animal
testing guidelines,

555
01:00:15,613 --> 01:00:16,823
in one way or another.

556
01:00:18,741 --> 01:00:20,031
This one's pretty exhaustive.

557
01:00:20,117 --> 01:00:22,907
It's arranged according to the
brand names and formula patent.

558
01:00:24,330 --> 01:00:27,210
And here's the latest documentation.
You can take that as well.

559
01:00:30,628 --> 01:00:32,168
How is your case progressing?

560
01:00:32,755 --> 01:00:36,375
Oh, it'll change a lot of things now.
Thank you so much.

561
01:00:38,177 --> 01:00:41,507
So, this is where you carry out
your Experiments with Truth?

562
01:00:42,056 --> 01:00:44,806
You know, this place reeks
of a violent past.

563
01:00:45,351 --> 01:00:47,391
Just convenient for the community.

564
01:00:47,686 --> 01:00:49,806
It was the only place we
found on our way.

565
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:52,360
This is the second time we
are in a biology lab this week.

566
01:00:52,441 --> 01:00:53,731
How are you keeping?

567
01:00:54,234 --> 01:00:55,234
I'm alright.

568
01:00:56,945 --> 01:00:58,155
Pastafarian!

569
01:00:58,822 --> 01:01:01,032
Is that a new joke?
- Not mine, and it's not a joke.

570
01:01:01,158 --> 01:01:02,988
It's a very serious religion
I follow!

571
01:01:04,078 --> 01:01:06,248
You know, I always knew
monks are closet drinkers

572
01:01:06,747 --> 01:01:09,377
but unfortunately liver cirrhosis
is going to give you away.

573
01:01:09,458 --> 01:01:12,628
You know it should have more to do with
intoxication than with drinking.

574
01:01:14,088 --> 01:01:16,588
We leave tomorrow…

575
01:01:16,757 --> 01:01:18,297
Why are you not taking medicines?

576
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:20,890
Because there are no alternatives.

577
01:01:20,969 --> 01:01:22,259
Every medicine has animal
violence behind it.

578
01:01:22,388 --> 01:01:24,428
But how does your boycotting
make a difference?

579
01:01:24,515 --> 01:01:26,135
That way, nothing
makes a difference.

580
01:01:26,183 --> 01:01:28,393
Exactly! See, it's pretty clear
how inconsequential

581
01:01:28,519 --> 01:01:30,479
our actions are in the
larger scheme of things.

582
01:01:30,562 --> 01:01:32,272
I am not convinced.

583
01:01:32,856 --> 01:01:37,436
Every molecule in the universe is
affected by our actions.

584
01:01:37,903 --> 01:01:40,163
That is the truth or else
everything is meaningless.

585
01:01:40,531 --> 01:01:42,241
What is the sense of
existence then?

586
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:45,413
The hedonism and nihilism of
your namesake, Charvaka?

587
01:01:47,913 --> 01:01:51,883
So, your worldview provides
you with meaning… purpose?

588
01:01:52,084 --> 01:01:53,174
See, we are dualists.

589
01:01:53,669 --> 01:01:55,499
If you were to ask me if life
is perpetual or temporary,

590
01:01:55,546 --> 01:01:57,006
I would say, it's both.

591
01:01:57,464 --> 01:01:59,804
Temporary for the body
and infinite for the soul.

592
01:02:00,008 --> 01:02:02,088
The soul is formless, shapeless,
it's non-matter…

593
01:02:02,136 --> 01:02:05,056
And it connects to the world
through the body…

594
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:07,890
and every minute action, even inaction,

595
01:02:07,975 --> 01:02:10,595
leaves behind a karmic
record on the soul.

596
01:02:11,895 --> 01:02:13,805
And the purpose of our
existence is

597
01:02:14,022 --> 01:02:16,442
enlightenment and eventual liberation

598
01:02:16,567 --> 01:02:18,487
from the perpetual suffering
of life and death.

599
01:02:18,569 --> 01:02:21,409
Okay, so then why is it so
important to not kill?

600
01:02:22,114 --> 01:02:25,874
I mean, if you kill an animal, it's probably
going to come back, perhaps happier.

601
01:02:25,993 --> 01:02:29,003
Freedom of choice and right of consent
is the core of our world view.

602
01:02:29,163 --> 01:02:33,423
What about killing by consent?
- How do you judge the validity of consent?

603
01:02:37,171 --> 01:02:38,671
What about the violence
that you are

604
01:02:38,797 --> 01:02:41,047
committing on yourself by
not taking medication?

605
01:02:41,717 --> 01:02:43,047
How is your choice
a choice of sanity?

606
01:02:43,135 --> 01:02:45,505
How is it not different
from a suicide bomber

607
01:02:45,888 --> 01:02:47,598
who is so convinced about
the fundamentalism

608
01:02:47,723 --> 01:02:49,393
of his political and religious thoughts?

609
01:02:50,434 --> 01:02:52,104
Are you really making
that analogy?

610
01:02:54,188 --> 01:02:55,268
What happened?

611
01:02:56,064 --> 01:02:58,234
See, I am not good at this
but I am going to try.

612
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:03,610
There are a lot of people who love you,
respect you and need you including myself.

613
01:03:04,281 --> 01:03:07,201
I know you're a rational, open minded
person so I can only suggest…

614
01:03:07,868 --> 01:03:09,038
Please take care of yourself.

615
01:03:09,411 --> 01:03:10,411
I will.

616
01:03:12,539 --> 01:03:13,619
I'll see you later then.

617
01:03:14,416 --> 01:03:15,416
Stay for a while.

618
01:03:15,459 --> 01:03:16,459
No.

619
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:52,400
You know, one of my friends
interns at Munshi and Lal.

620
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:55,569
I think you've mentioned of him before. Is he good?
- No.

621
01:09:55,942 --> 01:10:00,202
But this comes from him. Apparently, they used
some local muscle to threaten Maitreya.

622
01:10:00,363 --> 01:10:01,363
What? When?

623
01:10:01,781 --> 01:10:03,491
A little while ago.
It was a soft call.

624
01:10:03,742 --> 01:10:07,252
They studied his routine
for a couple of days

625
01:10:07,537 --> 01:10:09,867
and then they tried to corner him
on one of the rainy nights

626
01:10:09,956 --> 01:10:11,876
when he was just beginning
his walk to the court.

627
01:10:11,958 --> 01:10:15,128
The partners of the firm were very
angry with their client for doing this.

628
01:10:15,212 --> 01:10:18,842
Now, what I am surprised about is that Maitreya
hasn't mentioned any of this to any of us.

629
01:10:19,424 --> 01:10:22,514
He's not going to mention it.
For all you know, he won't even remember.

630
01:10:23,386 --> 01:10:25,136
What exactly did
Jagannath say?

631
01:10:25,222 --> 01:10:27,602
Just what I told you
over the phone.

632
01:10:27,974 --> 01:10:31,524
That he has stopped eating,
and he rarely speaks.

633
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:36,150
Jagannath believes that Maitreya has
taken Sansar Bhava Bhagga vow!

634
01:10:36,399 --> 01:10:37,479
What is that?

635
01:10:38,276 --> 01:10:40,486
It's an ancient custom in
his religion.

636
01:10:40,612 --> 01:10:43,412
A monk ailing from an
untreatable disease

637
01:10:43,823 --> 01:10:47,123
can make peace with himself and
choose to withdraw from life.

638
01:10:47,369 --> 01:10:48,659
How do you withdraw from life?

639
01:10:49,496 --> 01:10:51,536
It's one way of saying
fast unto death.

640
01:10:51,623 --> 01:10:53,123
Fast unto death?
That's extreme!

641
01:10:53,875 --> 01:10:55,785
But, his liver cirrhosis is
treatable, right?

642
01:10:55,877 --> 01:10:57,247
Not the way he prefers it.

643
01:10:57,462 --> 01:10:59,012
I don't get this idea
of karma.

644
01:10:59,256 --> 01:11:00,916
Does the intention not matter
at all?

645
01:11:01,007 --> 01:11:04,757
The experiments are not being conducted
with the intention of inflicting pain…

646
01:11:04,844 --> 01:11:06,764
but the intention of
relieving pain.

647
01:11:07,931 --> 01:11:13,601
You see, in his world, it's not all humanity
that's equal, it's all existence that's equal.

648
01:11:13,853 --> 01:11:18,783
But, anyway, keep working on it. We'll need
ideas like these before we can make him budge.

649
01:11:24,906 --> 01:11:25,906
There was an island…

650
01:11:26,574 --> 01:11:29,334
and you were to be reborn
as a tormentor or a slave.

651
01:11:29,869 --> 01:11:31,749
The tormentor would make
life hell for you.

652
01:11:32,372 --> 01:11:35,962
He will give infinite pain to you
and your kin, just for his pleasure.

653
01:11:37,669 --> 01:11:42,339
And… he had no remorse
over his actions to crush his victim.

654
01:11:43,133 --> 01:11:47,893
Add to that there was no
karma, no soul, no retribution…

655
01:11:49,681 --> 01:11:52,181
no being responsible
for your actions.

656
01:11:53,310 --> 01:11:56,020
And you had to choose
any one of them. Who would you be?

657
01:11:57,147 --> 01:11:58,607
You do realize that you're
going to give up your life,

658
01:11:58,815 --> 01:12:01,025
for something that is nothing
more than a thought experiment?

659
01:12:04,362 --> 01:12:05,362
And…

660
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:07,490
monks are supposed to
be celibate, right?

661
01:12:07,824 --> 01:12:11,834
So, I don't understand why there is so much
intellectual masturbation in the first place?

662
01:12:13,204 --> 01:12:14,914
Look into your own religion.

663
01:12:15,206 --> 01:12:17,076
There's constant reference
to relativity.

664
01:12:17,751 --> 01:12:18,751
Your ancients…

665
01:12:19,544 --> 01:12:20,884
they were masters of understanding…

666
01:12:21,004 --> 01:12:23,724
that there is no one ultimate
rule book for all situations.

667
01:12:24,299 --> 01:12:26,839
The woman churning
curd into butter…

668
01:12:27,969 --> 01:12:29,849
she has to pull one
end of the rope

669
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:32,810
and let the other end go
otherwise the rope will break.

670
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:36,480
Contradictions and polarities are
two ends of the same rope.

671
01:12:37,562 --> 01:12:40,022
You pull one end and
let the other end go.

672
01:12:40,607 --> 01:12:43,027
Yes, it's very convenient to
hold on to one rope

673
01:12:43,234 --> 01:12:45,784
and let the other one lose
as and when you feel like.

674
01:12:47,072 --> 01:12:48,782
I guess we all agree
with reason…

675
01:12:50,742 --> 01:12:52,622
now it's only a
matter of disposition.

676
01:17:02,619 --> 01:17:03,949
Keep sleeping.

677
01:17:04,162 --> 01:17:05,162
How are you feeling?

678
01:17:05,288 --> 01:17:06,328
Fantastic.

679
01:17:06,914 --> 01:17:08,004
Are you up for some banter?

680
01:17:08,082 --> 01:17:09,082
Always.

681
01:17:09,667 --> 01:17:10,667
I got you a gift.

682
01:17:14,589 --> 01:17:15,589
Alphabets.

683
01:17:20,553 --> 01:17:21,973
It's amazing how we imagine

684
01:17:22,722 --> 01:17:26,102
that someday these few alphabets will
just arrange themselves in a way

685
01:17:26,351 --> 01:17:28,981
that suddenly everything
will make perfect sense.

686
01:17:29,062 --> 01:17:30,402
A permutation of known words…

687
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:32,940
suddenly bringing forward a
previously unknown meaning.

688
01:17:34,651 --> 01:17:38,821
It's so oppressive, this obsession
with final answers.

689
01:17:40,156 --> 01:17:45,236
We invent god, soul, heaven, afterlife,
even life-imitating technology…

690
01:17:46,204 --> 01:17:49,714
all sorts of transcendence to cope
with the idea of an absolute end.

691
01:17:51,334 --> 01:17:55,674
And then, we die for an idea, which
promises some sort of immortality.

692
01:18:03,346 --> 01:18:05,846
It gives me some kicks
though, to know that

693
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:08,940
a part of me was a part of
an animal once…

694
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:11,150
a flame, a star.

695
01:18:11,771 --> 01:18:12,941
A part will become mineral,

696
01:18:13,314 --> 01:18:14,864
flow in a plant, sprout in a fruit,

697
01:18:14,899 --> 01:18:16,479
get pecked by a bird.

698
01:18:17,985 --> 01:18:21,405
Every atom of my body
recycled by the universe.

699
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:25,200
You think you're a person
but you're a colony.

700
01:18:25,993 --> 01:18:29,213
A microcosm, which has ten times
more bacteria in its body

701
01:18:29,455 --> 01:18:30,705
than it has human cells.

702
01:18:31,582 --> 01:18:32,752
Here, check this out.

703
01:18:38,798 --> 01:18:41,178
U for Unilateralis Cordyceps.

704
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:45,510
The fungus enters an ant's
body through its respiration.

705
01:18:46,097 --> 01:18:48,637
It invades it's brain and changes
how it perceives smell…

706
01:18:48,933 --> 01:18:52,153
because ants do everything they do
from their smell of pheromones, right?

707
01:18:52,353 --> 01:18:54,063
So this microscopic little
fungal spore

708
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:57,360
then makes the ant climb up the stem
of a plant and bite hard on a leaf

709
01:18:57,525 --> 01:18:58,775
with an abnormal force.

710
01:18:59,527 --> 01:19:01,947
The fungus then kills the ant,
and continues to grow

711
01:19:02,447 --> 01:19:04,447
leaving the ant's exoskeleton intact.

712
01:19:05,074 --> 01:19:09,544
So, a small fungus drives an ant around
as a vehicle, uses it as food and shelter

713
01:19:09,620 --> 01:19:11,830
and then as the ultimate monument to itself.

714
01:19:12,623 --> 01:19:14,543
And when the fungus is ready to reproduce

715
01:19:14,667 --> 01:19:17,547
it's fruiting bodies grow from
the ant's head and rupture

716
01:19:18,004 --> 01:19:21,974
releasing the spores, letting the wind
carry them to more unsuspecting food.

717
01:19:23,217 --> 01:19:24,217
There…

718
01:19:25,011 --> 01:19:27,641
our entire idea of free
will down the bin.

719
01:19:29,098 --> 01:19:31,728
One single small fungus
spore does that to an ant.

720
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:34,561
You have trillions of bacteria
in your body.

721
01:19:35,563 --> 01:19:36,773
How do you know
where you end…

722
01:19:36,814 --> 01:19:38,654
and where your
environment begins?

723
01:20:14,977 --> 01:20:17,607
Sir, please tell me…

724
01:20:17,939 --> 01:20:19,729
Do we really have souls?

725
01:20:26,906 --> 01:20:28,316
Sir, please tell me

726
01:20:30,034 --> 01:20:31,034
I don't know.

727
01:22:02,543 --> 01:22:06,093
Why am I tied?

728
01:22:07,965 --> 01:22:08,965
Do you need something?

729
01:22:09,133 --> 01:22:10,133
Call my mother.

730
01:22:13,137 --> 01:22:15,427
Please try to understand.

731
01:22:24,148 --> 01:22:25,358
Is that you, Jagannath?

732
01:22:26,525 --> 01:22:30,105
Are you okay?
- Yes. How are you feeling?

733
01:22:30,821 --> 01:22:32,111
Are you mocking me?

734
01:22:33,950 --> 01:22:36,120
What are you saying?

735
01:22:39,288 --> 01:22:40,578
How much time do we have?

736
01:22:40,706 --> 01:22:42,076
For what?

737
01:23:33,884 --> 01:23:35,014
Jagannath…

738
01:23:38,931 --> 01:23:39,931
Yes, sir?

739
01:23:48,566 --> 01:23:50,226
Call Doctor Bhargava.

740
01:23:54,155 --> 01:23:56,775
Tell him I agree.

741
01:24:02,413 --> 01:24:05,083
I am not ready to go yet.

742
01:25:36,757 --> 01:25:38,547
The price is still low.

743
01:25:39,009 --> 01:25:41,469
What was at 1200 is now 300.

744
01:25:43,222 --> 01:25:44,602
One second.

745
01:25:46,308 --> 01:25:47,348
Yes, sir.

746
01:25:51,147 --> 01:25:52,857
Bro!

747
01:25:55,109 --> 01:25:57,069
It's a debit of Rs. 350,000.

748
01:25:59,321 --> 01:26:01,531
Sir, can I collect the cheque tomorrow?

749
01:26:02,116 --> 01:26:05,576
You won't get these prices in the market.

750
01:26:07,246 --> 01:26:08,956
Okay, I'll wait for your call.

751
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:12,170
Did you ask when we can leave?
- Today?

752
01:26:12,710 --> 01:26:15,960
Of course. Ask today!
- I mean we can leave today.

753
01:26:16,755 --> 01:26:18,255
Who told you?
- The nurse.

754
01:26:18,757 --> 01:26:20,677
Who told her?
- How would I know?

755
01:26:21,135 --> 01:26:23,965
She said your reports are alright,
your creatinine levels seem normal.

756
01:26:24,054 --> 01:26:26,474
Get the discharge papers, and leave.
- Can I take these off now?

757
01:26:27,308 --> 01:26:28,308
Maybe.

758
01:26:29,143 --> 01:26:32,563
Trust you to never
get proper answers.

759
01:26:33,022 --> 01:26:34,062
What are you watching?

760
01:26:34,356 --> 01:26:36,816
It's the same channel repeated all through.

761
01:26:37,109 --> 01:26:39,569
Idiot! Only 1, 2, 3 and 84
are the same. Here!

762
01:26:40,529 --> 01:26:42,029
What else did the nurse say?

763
01:26:42,781 --> 01:26:43,991
Rest is private.

764
01:26:44,033 --> 01:26:46,083
Oi! Private chat! You bitch…

765
01:26:46,702 --> 01:26:48,082
Naveen!

766
01:26:48,245 --> 01:26:49,865
What are you guys up to?
- Nothing, sir!

767
01:26:50,164 --> 01:26:53,174
How are you feeling today?
- Perfect! May I leave today?

768
01:26:53,417 --> 01:26:55,707
Let me check first.

769
01:27:00,382 --> 01:27:01,512
Can I take this off?

770
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:05,180
Sure. Nurse, help him.
Else he'll carry it home!

771
01:27:05,763 --> 01:27:07,773
Sir, come home sometime.

772
01:27:10,976 --> 01:27:15,896
I've been to your house plenty of times.
- Not since I moved to Mumbai.

773
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:18,320
Yeah…

774
01:27:18,734 --> 01:27:20,034
How is your grandmother?

775
01:27:20,152 --> 01:27:20,952
She's great.

776
01:27:21,070 --> 01:27:23,610
Thanks to her, you've recovered
so soon.

777
01:27:23,864 --> 01:27:24,414
Yes.

778
01:27:24,531 --> 01:27:25,781
What do you call her?
- Ajji!

779
01:27:25,866 --> 01:27:28,196
Aaji?
- Ajji.

780
01:27:28,410 --> 01:27:29,660
Even we say 'Aaji' in Marathi?

781
01:27:29,828 --> 01:27:31,288
In Rajasthan, we say
'Baasah'…

782
01:27:31,372 --> 01:27:32,252
but I call her Ajji.

783
01:27:32,331 --> 01:27:33,541
You speak Kannada?

784
01:27:33,999 --> 01:27:35,079
Not really.

785
01:27:35,251 --> 01:27:38,341
Mom used it only when
she was angry.

786
01:27:38,712 --> 01:27:41,512
So you've learnt the curses!
- Just the curses.

787
01:27:41,882 --> 01:27:44,592
Your grandmother speaks so many
languages… even Spanish.

788
01:27:45,261 --> 01:27:46,511
But she doesn't speak Marwari!

789
01:28:22,589 --> 01:28:25,429
When Mannu got the discharge
papers done

790
01:28:26,176 --> 01:28:27,926
I called some friends over.

791
01:28:28,429 --> 01:28:30,389
I thought we'd throw a party for you.

792
01:28:31,307 --> 01:28:33,347
Why don't you call some
of your friends?

793
01:28:34,143 --> 01:28:36,103
I don't have any friends
here in Mumbai.

794
01:28:38,063 --> 01:28:40,823
Mukhtiyar Ali is in the city.

795
01:28:41,817 --> 01:28:43,187
I have invited him too.

796
01:28:43,319 --> 01:28:45,069
Do you like his music?

797
01:28:47,531 --> 01:28:49,531
Even he is from Rajasthan.

798
01:28:49,783 --> 01:28:51,493
I am sure you must have
heard his music.

799
01:28:52,536 --> 01:28:54,246
No… never got a chance.

800
01:28:58,542 --> 01:29:00,632
How are you Raju?
- I'm good… and you, brother?

801
01:29:00,711 --> 01:29:01,751
Great!

802
01:29:02,379 --> 01:29:03,759
I will join you in a moment.

803
01:29:06,091 --> 01:29:08,341
I had invited Dr. Kerkar as well

804
01:29:08,510 --> 01:29:10,970
but he is tied up with work.

805
01:29:12,431 --> 01:29:13,681
Did you get along with him?

806
01:29:13,891 --> 01:29:14,891
Yes!

807
01:29:15,726 --> 01:29:17,186
He speaks highly of you.

808
01:29:17,728 --> 01:29:20,188
He used to write revolutionary songs!
- Dr. Kerkar?

809
01:29:20,314 --> 01:29:21,314
Yes!

810
01:29:21,398 --> 01:29:23,978
Just like your friend who had come
to see me at the hospital?

811
01:29:24,443 --> 01:29:25,443
Yes.

812
01:29:25,986 --> 01:29:28,316
Did you read her book?

813
01:29:28,822 --> 01:29:30,912
No… didn't get the time.

814
01:29:31,617 --> 01:29:34,947
When she gave you the book,
she asked if you would read it.

815
01:29:35,412 --> 01:29:36,412
Then, why did you say you would?

816
01:29:36,622 --> 01:29:40,172
How can I say no when
she's offering me her book?

817
01:29:40,709 --> 01:29:42,249
She'll be here in the evening.

818
01:29:42,628 --> 01:29:44,548
Tell her the truth if she asks.

819
01:29:45,464 --> 01:29:47,674
Don't make alibis like
not having had the time.

820
01:29:48,342 --> 01:29:49,342
Okay?

821
01:29:53,305 --> 01:29:54,305
Wait a second.

822
01:29:54,598 --> 01:29:56,558
The address is right here…
it's on the poster.

823
01:29:57,434 --> 01:30:02,064
It's not .net, it's .edu. E-D-U

824
01:30:03,232 --> 01:30:05,362
Yeah… I'm sorry.

825
01:30:06,735 --> 01:30:08,525
You got it right?

826
01:30:18,372 --> 01:30:19,672
Hey! How are you?

827
01:30:19,915 --> 01:30:21,075
I'm good, how are you?

828
01:30:21,333 --> 01:30:23,003
I'm good. How are you feeling now?

829
01:30:23,836 --> 01:30:24,876
I'm perfectly fine now.

830
01:30:25,087 --> 01:30:26,247
What are you up
to these days?

831
01:30:26,547 --> 01:30:28,087
Lot of things have been happening.

832
01:30:28,090 --> 01:30:31,930
An activist has been
imprisoned in Chattisgarh

833
01:30:32,428 --> 01:30:34,218
for baseless charges…
- Navin Sir!

834
01:32:10,859 --> 01:32:13,569
Sexaria wants to meet us.
- It's Sekhsaria, not 'Sexaria'!

835
01:32:13,820 --> 01:32:16,070
Yamamoto guys coming along?
- No…

836
01:32:16,156 --> 01:32:17,986
But, he will give us the
cheque today.

837
01:32:20,452 --> 01:32:23,082
Where do we meet?
Your office has been hijacked.

838
01:32:30,379 --> 01:32:31,589
So, who did you vote for?

839
01:32:31,630 --> 01:32:34,550
You don't have to answer that!
How can you ask?!

840
01:32:34,591 --> 01:32:35,631
I didn't vote.

841
01:32:36,051 --> 01:32:40,561
My dear grandson is only interested in
money not in the world around.

842
01:32:40,889 --> 01:32:42,599
At least someone
is interested in money.

843
01:32:42,641 --> 01:32:45,851
If everyone is broke like us,
who'll pay our pensions?

844
01:32:55,112 --> 01:32:58,372
So, you like the college type?
Take this number down.

845
01:32:58,865 --> 01:33:00,825
Might come handy.
- No! Nothing like that.

846
01:33:00,951 --> 01:33:04,331
I'll take it…
for a lonely night!

847
01:33:04,538 --> 01:33:06,158
What about the Yamamoto meeting?

848
01:33:07,332 --> 01:33:08,332
Yes.

849
01:33:12,462 --> 01:33:13,462
They've sent a cheque.

850
01:33:18,635 --> 01:33:19,755
This says 28th.

851
01:33:20,304 --> 01:33:21,474
The coming 28th.

852
01:33:22,180 --> 01:33:23,560
That one is hilarious!

853
01:33:24,683 --> 01:33:26,563
How's grandma now?
- She's fine.

854
01:33:27,227 --> 01:33:29,647
Tell me if you need any help —
legal… not so legal.

855
01:33:30,689 --> 01:33:31,979
I have connections up to Rao.

856
01:33:32,649 --> 01:33:34,479
Rao?
- State home minister!

857
01:33:34,526 --> 01:33:35,396
Oh, right!

858
01:33:35,485 --> 01:33:37,395
Can I forward this?
- Sure.

859
01:34:02,596 --> 01:34:05,136
Will you call for a nurse?

860
01:34:05,557 --> 01:34:07,347
I rang the bell a few times.

861
01:34:26,161 --> 01:34:27,831
Can you send a nurse
please?

862
01:34:27,913 --> 01:34:30,753
They're all busy in the
operation theatre.

863
01:34:31,416 --> 01:34:34,996
What about you?
- I am busy.

864
01:34:49,559 --> 01:34:52,439
No one's free.
Do you need to pee?

865
01:34:53,480 --> 01:34:55,610
I wanted to, but I'll wait.

866
01:34:55,649 --> 01:34:56,939
I'll help you.

867
01:34:58,318 --> 01:35:00,108
No, I can wait for a bit.

868
01:35:00,570 --> 01:35:04,200
They'll take at least half an hour.

869
01:35:24,970 --> 01:35:28,310
You're so liberal-minded,
then why are you feeling embarrassed?

870
01:38:12,053 --> 01:38:15,103
Saying that I am ignorant and
uneducated is one thing…

871
01:38:15,932 --> 01:38:19,352
but if you call me a sucker
for money wouldn't it hurt?

872
01:38:21,271 --> 01:38:22,901
I challenge you…

873
01:38:24,316 --> 01:38:27,686
only so you learn to live.

874
01:38:27,903 --> 01:38:30,493
Your way of looking at life cannot
be the only way, can it?

875
01:38:30,739 --> 01:38:32,909
Okay, then tell me your idea of living?

876
01:38:33,158 --> 01:38:37,828
I eat well, drink well… people
around me respect me.

877
01:38:38,788 --> 01:38:40,998
Is that enough?
- It's good enough for me.

878
01:38:42,792 --> 01:38:44,882
Life is so magnificent.

879
01:38:45,503 --> 01:38:48,843
There is so much to explore.
- I'm not interested!

880
01:38:49,132 --> 01:38:51,182
Does that make me a bad person?

881
01:38:51,927 --> 01:38:55,057
If you don't want to understand,
then don't talk rubbish.

882
01:38:55,513 --> 01:38:57,893
So, you tell me
What does one need in life?

883
01:38:58,224 --> 01:39:00,694
Happiness…
and some compassion…

884
01:39:00,977 --> 01:39:02,227
Isn't that enough?

885
01:39:03,313 --> 01:39:04,313
It's enough, yes.

886
01:39:05,106 --> 01:39:07,026
You can't reduce it to 'good' or 'bad'.

887
01:39:08,610 --> 01:39:12,780
It's about experiencing the entire
spectrum of thought and emotion

888
01:39:12,864 --> 01:39:14,454
about connecting with society.

889
01:39:14,908 --> 01:39:16,618
But, I am compassionate!

890
01:39:17,577 --> 01:39:21,037
You don't even know who
needs your compassion

891
01:39:22,332 --> 01:39:25,422
or what consequences your actions have.

892
01:39:26,670 --> 01:39:29,670
What is the point of such compassion?

893
01:39:29,923 --> 01:39:33,433
Society should benefit from
your existence!

894
01:39:33,510 --> 01:39:35,430
This is exactly what ticked off mom.

895
01:39:35,887 --> 01:39:38,347
All this idealistic jargon from
your pretentious friends!

896
01:39:38,723 --> 01:39:40,523
Another misunderstanding!

897
01:39:41,559 --> 01:39:46,189
They weren't pretentious.

898
01:39:46,815 --> 01:39:47,815
They were activists!

899
01:39:47,983 --> 01:39:51,863
Sacrificing one's life for a cause
is a huge expectation from anyone.

900
01:39:52,195 --> 01:39:57,115
See, this is why I don't
persuade you.

901
01:39:58,159 --> 01:40:00,659
Like I might have done with your mother.

902
01:40:01,121 --> 01:40:02,501
She was blessed with everything.

903
01:40:03,790 --> 01:40:04,960
But did she share anything?

904
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:08,040
And how have you
changed the world?

905
01:40:08,211 --> 01:40:10,761
When the nation was fighting for freedom
you'd leave mom with the neighbours

906
01:40:11,006 --> 01:40:13,296
and go off spreading condom
awareness in villages…

907
01:40:13,591 --> 01:40:15,471
Was that your revolution?

908
01:40:15,593 --> 01:40:18,303
If your work had made any difference, then
where did these billion people come from?!

909
01:40:18,430 --> 01:40:21,980
We've been fighting slavery and
repression for three generations…

910
01:40:22,142 --> 01:40:27,022
just to see my grandson
be a slave to the Americans?

911
01:40:27,147 --> 01:40:29,767
Have you gone senile?
These foreign companies are my clients!

912
01:40:29,899 --> 01:40:31,779
Look at your manners!

913
01:40:33,445 --> 01:40:36,235
Calling your own grandmother senile!

914
01:40:36,322 --> 01:40:37,662
Okay, I apologize.

915
01:40:37,699 --> 01:40:41,119
We'll confront this when one
of us understands the other.

916
01:40:41,286 --> 01:40:43,616
The country was
independent by then.

917
01:40:43,913 --> 01:40:47,503
Get your history right!
- Mannu! Take care of Ajji for a while.

918
01:40:47,917 --> 01:40:49,247
But what will I do in there?

919
01:40:49,502 --> 01:40:52,422
Shall I ask her to recommend me a book?
- Are you crazy?

920
01:40:52,589 --> 01:40:54,259
She will cross examine
you for every page.

921
01:41:04,350 --> 01:41:07,230
Why are you watching this?
It's only on 1, 2, 3 and 84.

922
01:41:07,479 --> 01:41:08,479
Here!

923
01:42:34,899 --> 01:42:36,229
Has someone died?

924
01:42:36,609 --> 01:42:39,319
Her husband, poor guy, got fucked, man!
- What happened?

925
01:42:39,404 --> 01:42:42,574
He got his appendix operated
a month ago at some shady hospital.

926
01:42:43,074 --> 01:42:46,624
Got back to work in a couple of days…
he's a laborer.

927
01:42:46,786 --> 01:42:50,206
Collapsed, yesterday, on site.
His boss admitted him here.

928
01:42:50,790 --> 01:42:53,130
When they operated him again, they
found a kidney missing.

929
01:42:53,209 --> 01:42:54,209
What do you mean?

930
01:42:55,128 --> 01:42:57,458
When they opened him
up for the appendix

931
01:42:57,589 --> 01:42:59,049
they also flicked his kidney.

932
01:42:59,549 --> 01:43:00,549
But how?

933
01:43:00,717 --> 01:43:04,137
It happens all the time in
those shady hospitals!

934
01:43:08,016 --> 01:43:10,266
Please go and ask her
the date of the operation.

935
01:43:10,685 --> 01:43:14,055
What the hell man?
Look at the flight of stairs!

936
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:16,150
Please.

937
01:43:16,733 --> 01:43:17,733
Oh man!

938
01:43:57,815 --> 01:43:59,395
The 16th of last month.

939
01:44:00,485 --> 01:44:01,815
When was yours?

940
01:44:02,695 --> 01:44:04,155
On the 17th.

941
01:44:07,158 --> 01:44:10,948
Find out his blood group.
- Again these stairs?

942
01:44:33,643 --> 01:44:35,233
Same as yours.

943
01:45:02,130 --> 01:45:04,260
Excuse me!
Which ward is Shankar in?

944
01:45:04,382 --> 01:45:06,512
Shankar who?
- The guy who got operated yesterday.

945
01:45:06,592 --> 01:45:09,262
His wife was crying, remember?
- He got discharged.

946
01:45:10,221 --> 01:45:13,271
But he was only operated yesterday.
- Yes, but he got discharged.

947
01:45:14,225 --> 01:45:15,725
Can I have his address?

948
01:45:16,269 --> 01:45:17,269
Wait.

949
01:45:28,823 --> 01:45:29,823
Hello Navin!

950
01:45:31,534 --> 01:45:34,414
Sir, the kidney, I've received…
Are you sure it's from a dead man?

951
01:45:34,495 --> 01:45:38,785
Of course! There are only two ways.
Either from a brain dead patient…

952
01:45:38,875 --> 01:45:40,245
or a family member.

953
01:45:44,213 --> 01:45:45,303
So…

954
01:45:45,590 --> 01:45:47,800
can I get some information
about my donor?

955
01:45:49,385 --> 01:45:52,215
I'll connect you to an NGO.

956
01:45:52,388 --> 01:45:54,178
you can take it from there.

957
01:45:54,265 --> 01:45:56,305
They hold community meetings
between donors and recipients.

958
01:45:56,351 --> 01:45:59,101
Here, keep their card.

959
01:46:01,773 --> 01:46:04,193
The doctor confirmed that you didn't
get your kidney from that guy.

960
01:46:04,275 --> 01:46:05,485
Then, why do we need to meet him now?

961
01:46:05,902 --> 01:46:07,572
How do we know what's going on?

962
01:46:08,196 --> 01:46:10,816
I'll feel better once I clarify it
with the NGO.

963
01:46:13,659 --> 01:46:16,539
And what if you discover you
have a stolen kidney?

964
01:46:17,163 --> 01:46:18,253
I'll return it.

965
01:46:21,084 --> 01:46:22,924
Look ahead…
- Wait… wait!

966
01:46:24,212 --> 01:46:25,252
Have you lost it?

967
01:46:25,588 --> 01:46:27,628
Who returns a transplanted kidney?

968
01:46:27,882 --> 01:46:30,432
- Isn't it possible?
- No.

969
01:46:30,802 --> 01:46:32,892
The car won't squeeze through…

970
01:46:38,976 --> 01:46:40,936
Then what about you?
- I'll wait it out.

971
01:46:44,857 --> 01:46:46,147
It will jam against the wall.

972
01:46:49,320 --> 01:46:51,280
One second. Let me check.

973
01:46:55,243 --> 01:46:57,373
Pull back…
- Are you crazy?

974
01:46:57,578 --> 01:46:59,368
There's no space here, pull back.

975
01:47:02,792 --> 01:47:04,292
Let's palm him some money, then!

976
01:47:07,130 --> 01:47:08,210
But, that's wrong!

977
01:47:19,350 --> 01:47:22,400
Yes… Yes… Okay…
Okay… Thank you.

978
01:47:23,062 --> 01:47:24,652
You satisfied now?

979
01:47:25,356 --> 01:47:27,106
Yeah, the NGO says my
kidney is from a legit source.

980
01:47:27,191 --> 01:47:28,941
Lets get back to
the hospital then?

981
01:47:29,318 --> 01:47:30,318
Listen!

982
01:47:31,362 --> 01:47:33,362
Now that were here
let's meet him.

983
01:47:56,679 --> 01:47:58,259
Should I get us two coupons?

984
01:48:00,850 --> 01:48:02,850
Where is Shankar's house?

985
01:48:08,232 --> 01:48:13,572
Two buildings after Sachin's building
… right ahead.

986
01:48:14,947 --> 01:48:16,987
Wow! You have 46 here!
- Shut up.

987
01:48:32,381 --> 01:48:34,431
Can you draw us a map?

988
01:48:54,153 --> 01:48:55,493
Is this Shankar's house?

989
01:48:55,947 --> 01:48:57,487
Must be on the other
side, then.

990
01:48:59,075 --> 01:49:00,985
This way.
Where are you going?

991
01:49:02,912 --> 01:49:04,662
Where?
- No, he stays there…

992
01:49:04,830 --> 01:49:06,040
The snack-seller, right?

993
01:49:06,374 --> 01:49:09,344
Not the snack-seller!
The bricklayer.

994
01:49:11,254 --> 01:49:12,344
Careful.

995
01:49:22,932 --> 01:49:24,812
How do they walk up all these stairs!

996
01:49:34,986 --> 01:49:36,146
It's on the sea-link.

997
01:49:37,321 --> 01:49:38,741
Looks like he lives
there now!

998
01:49:43,953 --> 01:49:46,463
Oi! Push me.

999
01:49:47,081 --> 01:49:49,251
Turn, you buffoon!

1000
01:49:49,709 --> 01:49:52,039
Push me, man!
- You'll get jammed like this.

1001
01:49:54,589 --> 01:49:56,219
I'm hungry again.

1002
01:50:02,263 --> 01:50:04,683
Where does Shankar live?
- Up there.

1003
01:50:05,516 --> 01:50:06,556
Careful.

1004
01:50:17,612 --> 01:50:18,202
Aunty!

1005
01:50:18,487 --> 01:50:21,407
Is this Shankar's house?
- No, not this one.

1006
01:50:22,408 --> 01:50:24,408
It's there.
- Where?

1007
01:50:28,039 --> 01:50:29,459
Listen!

1008
01:50:30,166 --> 01:50:31,166
Yes, aunty?

1009
01:50:31,417 --> 01:50:33,627
The cops took him.

1010
01:50:34,712 --> 01:50:35,842
Few minutes back.

1011
01:50:53,731 --> 01:50:56,361
Sir, what about a similar case that
happened in Gurgaon six months back?

1012
01:51:22,218 --> 01:51:23,218
Have you eaten?

1013
01:51:33,771 --> 01:51:35,611
They will be punished, won't they?

1014
01:51:36,023 --> 01:51:37,153
Of course.

1015
01:51:39,735 --> 01:51:41,315
They won't be, the bastards

1016
01:51:42,780 --> 01:51:45,160
and the court case will burn me out.

1017
01:51:47,743 --> 01:51:49,753
Let them go to hell!

1018
01:51:51,956 --> 01:51:53,706
Their God will see to them.

1019
01:51:55,167 --> 01:51:57,337
I don't want anything to do
with the courts, sir.

1020
01:52:07,847 --> 01:52:08,847
This is for you.

1021
01:52:13,269 --> 01:52:15,059
Are you from the press?
- No.

1022
01:52:17,231 --> 01:52:19,191
Are you a cop?
- No.

1023
01:52:20,443 --> 01:52:25,363
Motherfucker! You think you can
pay your way out of this?

1024
01:52:28,075 --> 01:52:29,735
Return my kidney.

1025
01:52:30,828 --> 01:52:32,408
Leave him Shankar.

1026
01:52:35,166 --> 01:52:37,286
What am I to do, now?

1027
01:52:43,090 --> 01:52:45,130
Shankar, we haven't stolen
your kidney.

1028
01:52:53,142 --> 01:52:54,562
We want to help you.

1029
01:52:58,773 --> 01:53:00,403
What will I do, now?

1030
01:53:02,276 --> 01:53:03,686
We'll find him.

1031
01:53:40,105 --> 01:53:42,185
Sekhsaria is pretty resourceful!

1032
01:53:47,947 --> 01:53:48,947
Thank you!

1033
01:53:54,703 --> 01:53:55,833
Where's Stockholm?

1034
01:53:56,705 --> 01:53:58,075
How would I know?

1035
01:53:58,624 --> 01:53:59,714
Ask.

1036
01:54:46,797 --> 01:54:47,797
Ajay!

1037
01:54:53,512 --> 01:54:55,812
When I was new in town I
would get confused as well.

1038
01:54:56,181 --> 01:54:58,311
They drink straight from
the tap here.

1039
01:55:06,191 --> 01:55:07,281
What is this party for?

1040
01:55:07,359 --> 01:55:09,449
My friend, Rasmus…
It's his birthday!

1041
01:55:10,029 --> 01:55:11,029
Join us!

1042
01:55:18,787 --> 01:55:20,917
Saw her moustache?

1043
01:55:36,513 --> 01:55:38,563
Aron Jacobsen seems
like a nice guy.

1044
01:55:38,849 --> 01:55:43,059
He didn't ask too many questions.
Try not to offend him, though.

1045
01:55:43,187 --> 01:55:45,267
Here people sue each
other for every little thing.

1046
01:55:45,648 --> 01:55:47,938
You'll be gone,
but I've got to live here.

1047
01:55:48,067 --> 01:55:49,067
Sure.

1048
01:56:12,049 --> 01:56:13,929
It's stuck. Careful.

1049
01:56:18,681 --> 01:56:21,181
Oh, I won't be able to alight from here.

1050
01:56:23,560 --> 01:56:25,230
I'll get down from there.

1051
01:56:37,741 --> 01:56:38,831
Welcome!

1052
01:56:44,707 --> 01:56:46,457
Leave the shoes on.

1053
01:57:01,056 --> 01:57:02,346
You are?

1054
01:57:04,601 --> 01:57:07,271
Ajay.
- Hi! Navin.

1055
01:57:09,606 --> 01:57:16,946
You mentioned your friend works
for a charitable organization?

1056
01:57:17,281 --> 01:57:20,621
He wants to know which
organization do you work for.

1057
01:57:20,743 --> 01:57:23,503
Ask him if he knows
who he got his kidney from.

1058
01:57:23,912 --> 01:57:25,002
Kidney?

1059
01:57:25,372 --> 01:57:28,002
Did you say kidney?
- Yes, kidney.

1060
01:57:30,836 --> 01:57:33,666
Do you know who donated
the kidney?

1061
01:57:38,719 --> 01:57:41,759
I don't want to talk about it.

1062
01:57:42,014 --> 01:57:43,014
Will that be all?

1063
01:57:43,682 --> 01:57:45,852
He doesn't want to
talk about it.

1064
01:57:46,977 --> 01:57:50,557
Can I see your identification?

1065
01:57:51,607 --> 01:57:54,397
He wants to see our ID.
Let's get out of here.

1066
01:58:15,380 --> 01:58:18,050
Your kidney stolen…
from this man.

1067
01:58:18,133 --> 01:58:20,763
No, no, no…
Donated!

1068
01:58:22,137 --> 01:58:25,637
I paid a lot of money
to everybody.

1069
01:58:26,433 --> 01:58:28,773
What do you mean stolen?

1070
01:58:29,394 --> 01:58:32,484
'Stulen'.
- I know stolen means 'stulen'.

1071
01:58:33,857 --> 01:58:36,237
What does he
mean by stolen?

1072
01:58:37,778 --> 01:58:41,568
A man in need of money sold his kidney.
I am told it happens all the time in India.

1073
01:58:41,990 --> 01:58:45,540
It's best if you
leave.

1074
01:58:46,411 --> 01:58:50,211
There was a needy person
who sold it to him…

1075
01:58:50,582 --> 01:58:52,792
he was told it's a
common practice in India.

1076
01:58:53,085 --> 01:58:54,415
Tell him exactly what
happened.

1077
01:58:56,922 --> 01:58:57,922
Listen…

1078
01:58:58,423 --> 01:59:00,133
give us a minute to explain.

1079
01:59:00,300 --> 01:59:01,720
No! No!

1080
01:59:02,219 --> 01:59:07,429
I don't understand this!
You come into my house…

1081
01:59:08,767 --> 01:59:11,187
tell me you are from a
charitable organization…

1082
01:59:11,270 --> 01:59:17,150
and now you show me this!
Such liars!

1083
01:59:21,446 --> 01:59:23,866
He is calling us liars.

1084
01:59:25,659 --> 01:59:28,199
This man was to be operated…

1085
01:59:28,745 --> 01:59:30,405
for simple appendicitis.

1086
01:59:30,998 --> 01:59:36,168
And a month later he finds out
his kidney was stolen.

1087
01:59:37,504 --> 01:59:40,224
The racket has come out
in the open.

1088
01:59:40,507 --> 01:59:43,297
Wasn't it Dr. Rajesh Tharoor
who operated on him?

1089
01:59:44,136 --> 01:59:47,676
And all the doctors involved
in this racket have been nailed.

1090
01:59:48,682 --> 01:59:51,642
Ask him if Rajesh Tharoor had…
- That's what I am asking… hang on!

1091
01:59:51,727 --> 01:59:55,977
Rajesh Tharoor? He in jail?
- Yes… in jail!

1092
01:59:58,984 --> 02:00:01,114
But he's a good man.

1093
02:00:01,612 --> 02:00:02,652
Balls!

1094
02:00:03,155 --> 02:00:04,905
Says he's a good man.
- Let it be!

1095
02:00:09,828 --> 02:00:16,878
He's one of the biggest
profiteers from this racket.

1096
02:00:18,837 --> 02:00:22,217
Were you actually told that the
donor was being paid for the kidney?

1097
02:00:24,843 --> 02:00:25,973
I was.

1098
02:00:26,845 --> 02:00:27,505
Exactly!

1099
02:00:27,846 --> 02:00:30,176
They told him they were
going to buy him a kidney.

1100
02:00:30,474 --> 02:00:32,564
Is it right to buy one?
- True.

1101
02:00:33,518 --> 02:00:37,228
You think it's right
to buy a kidney?

1102
02:00:37,314 --> 02:00:39,824
Is it fair to use
poverty to your benefit?

1103
02:00:40,150 --> 02:00:48,030
Is it fair to use somebody's poverty
to your benefit?

1104
02:00:53,413 --> 02:00:56,043
You shouldn't be doing this.

1105
02:01:00,963 --> 02:01:03,423
It's unfair to exploit
my guilt like this.

1106
02:01:07,135 --> 02:01:11,305
What do you want from me?
- What do you want?

1107
02:01:20,023 --> 02:01:23,783
I told you… this means trouble.

1108
02:01:33,620 --> 02:01:38,630
Hey! It's me… Yes.
No, listen…

1109
02:01:38,750 --> 02:01:40,750
Two guys from India are here…

1110
02:01:45,048 --> 02:01:49,258
claim that they work for some
charitable organization.

1111
02:01:50,262 --> 02:01:53,102
Yeah… listen, they are asking
about the kidney.

1112
02:01:56,810 --> 02:01:59,020
That's not what I'm
trying to ask.

1113
02:02:04,151 --> 02:02:06,031
They're accusing it's stolen.

1114
02:02:08,113 --> 02:02:09,323
How? How is…?

1115
02:02:14,286 --> 02:02:16,116
Yes, I'll call you later.

1116
02:02:36,224 --> 02:02:40,154
I have no way of
confirming your claims.

1117
02:02:42,939 --> 02:02:44,729
I was told that the kidney…

1118
02:02:46,943 --> 02:02:49,453
was purchased from a
very needy person…

1119
02:02:50,405 --> 02:02:52,155
for a rather handsome amount.

1120
02:02:54,326 --> 02:02:57,946
I felt very guilty about
it even then.

1121
02:03:04,378 --> 02:03:07,298
I felt the burden of guilt
at every stage of the operation.

1122
02:03:11,843 --> 02:03:18,143
What could I have done?
What would anybody do?

1123
02:03:29,444 --> 02:03:32,784
Wait for a matching donor
and die if you don't find one?

1124
02:03:33,240 --> 02:03:39,120
Maybe my family was
protecting me emotionally…

1125
02:03:39,329 --> 02:03:44,329
by not telling me
it was a stolen kidney.

1126
02:03:47,087 --> 02:03:49,207
Maybe, the doctors feared they
will lose a client.

1127
02:03:49,297 --> 02:03:56,217
But what could I have
done even if…

1128
02:03:58,306 --> 02:04:05,556
they told me the kidney was…

1129
02:04:06,898 --> 02:04:10,358
stolen from somebody?

1130
02:04:16,992 --> 02:04:26,992
I'd like to believe you have
made up this entire story.

1131
02:04:29,379 --> 02:04:32,589
and are instigating my guilt to
make an easy buck from me.

1132
02:04:33,008 --> 02:04:37,098
You are lying. You should
leave before I call the cops.

1133
02:04:38,930 --> 02:04:43,310
He's saying he didn't have an option.

1134
02:04:43,602 --> 02:04:46,232
If he had waited, he
would be dead by now.

1135
02:04:46,438 --> 02:04:48,268
And now he wants to
call the police because

1136
02:04:48,356 --> 02:04:50,816
he thinks that we are
here to blackmail him.

1137
02:04:50,901 --> 02:04:53,401
Brother, listen to me…
Let's get out of here.

1138
02:05:00,744 --> 02:05:02,124
What the hell man?

1139
02:05:10,629 --> 02:05:12,129
Talk to him.

1140
02:05:15,550 --> 02:05:18,550
Tell him we just want
to help.

1141
02:05:22,807 --> 02:05:23,807
Sir!

1142
02:05:38,281 --> 02:05:39,911
We just want to help.

1143
02:05:44,996 --> 02:05:45,996
How?

1144
02:05:47,624 --> 02:05:48,964
He's asking how.

1145
02:05:49,626 --> 02:05:51,666
He would have to return
Shankar's kidney.

1146
02:05:52,712 --> 02:05:54,172
Seriously?

1147
02:05:57,467 --> 02:06:01,507
Shankar's kidney will have to
be returned to him.

1148
02:06:04,516 --> 02:06:06,096
That's ridiculous.

1149
02:06:10,480 --> 02:06:12,730
How is that a solution?
That's insane.

1150
02:06:14,150 --> 02:06:17,110
He says that's foolishness.
What kind of solution is that?

1151
02:06:23,243 --> 02:06:26,253
I can't possibly return
his kidney.

1152
02:06:32,627 --> 02:06:34,297
I'll find him a donor.

1153
02:06:40,594 --> 02:06:42,304
I'll pay for the operation.

1154
02:06:50,562 --> 02:06:52,772
I'll take responsibility for everything.

1155
02:06:55,275 --> 02:06:57,605
He is taking complete responsibility
for everything.

1156
02:07:00,155 --> 02:07:01,735
I need to do this.

1157
02:07:02,949 --> 02:07:05,539
He really wants to.

1158
02:07:06,578 --> 02:07:07,578
Finish it, man.

1159
02:07:11,666 --> 02:07:12,666
Okay.

1160
02:07:14,210 --> 02:07:15,210
Okay.

1161
02:07:28,224 --> 02:07:29,224
Let's go.

1162
02:07:39,444 --> 02:07:40,444
Thank you.

1163
02:09:10,326 --> 02:09:12,906
He has written…
Ajay and Navin…

1164
02:09:13,580 --> 02:09:17,790
thank you for all the
help so far…

1165
02:09:18,585 --> 02:09:21,545
He doesn't want to see
us both again.

1166
02:09:24,758 --> 02:09:27,758
Whatever remains to be sorted out…
is between him and Shanker.

1167
02:09:28,428 --> 02:09:33,768
Call my lawyer for any
further communication.

1168
02:09:34,058 --> 02:09:36,268
Has he given his lawyer's number?
- Yes, it is here.

1169
02:09:47,614 --> 02:09:48,784
One second…

1170
02:09:49,407 --> 02:09:50,407
Hello!

1171
02:09:51,117 --> 02:09:52,617
Yes? Hello!

1172
02:09:53,411 --> 02:09:56,541
Hey man! Spared any chicks?
- You are crazy.

1173
02:09:57,916 --> 02:09:59,076
Here, speak to him.

1174
02:10:01,628 --> 02:10:02,628
Hello?

1175
02:10:03,087 --> 02:10:04,707
Yes, sir?
- Yes Shankar…

1176
02:10:05,173 --> 02:10:06,173
How are you, brother?

1177
02:10:06,424 --> 02:10:09,684
Sir, thank you so much.
You've fixed everything so fast!

1178
02:10:10,220 --> 02:10:11,550
Never thought I'd
see so much money!

1179
02:10:11,638 --> 02:10:14,348
What are you talking about?
- Can you hear me?

1180
02:10:14,808 --> 02:10:17,388
A white man came by this morning
and gave me Rs. 650,000.

1181
02:10:17,477 --> 02:10:19,267
Don't take that money, Shankar.

1182
02:10:19,604 --> 02:10:21,404
Why? I've already taken it.

1183
02:10:21,564 --> 02:10:24,444
No, Shanker. Return the money.
We'll fight to get your kidney back.

1184
02:10:24,526 --> 02:10:27,146
Are you crazy? What will
I do with a kidney?

1185
02:10:27,570 --> 02:10:31,740
The market rate for a kidney is 30,000.
He's given me 650,000!

1186
02:10:32,075 --> 02:10:34,485
You can't evaluate parts of a body.
We will sue them.

1187
02:10:34,577 --> 02:10:36,497
You will get a new kidney
and the money you deserve.

1188
02:10:36,579 --> 02:10:38,119
And what if I don't?
- Then I'll pay you.

1189
02:10:38,206 --> 02:10:40,666
What's it to you?
You've already done enough.

1190
02:10:40,917 --> 02:10:42,457
I don't want to waste my
life seeking justice.

1191
02:10:42,544 --> 02:10:45,884
And, he said he'll
send me money every month.

1192
02:10:46,589 --> 02:10:48,129
Hello?
Listen to me brother…

1193
02:10:48,299 --> 02:10:50,639
He shoved the phone in my face…
- Give it back to him.

1194
02:10:50,927 --> 02:10:53,677
Shankar! Wait!
Oh, great one!

1195
02:10:54,931 --> 02:10:56,181
One minute…

1196
02:10:56,683 --> 02:10:59,023
I'm stuck, man… here.
- Listen Shankar…

1197
02:10:59,435 --> 02:11:02,645
You deserve better.
We'll fight for you!

1198
02:11:03,106 --> 02:11:06,066
Not that bullshit again.

1199
02:11:06,442 --> 02:11:09,362
I'll be getting money every month,
Why are you messing it up?

1200
02:11:09,445 --> 02:11:12,485
Don't fuck it up.
Just let me be. Keep this!

1201
02:12:00,455 --> 02:12:02,915
Okay, this is Omnacortil…

1202
02:12:03,082 --> 02:12:04,712
which is 20 mg now.

1203
02:12:05,668 --> 02:12:08,548
Vaisocon was 10 mg, but it's
been changed to 5 mg.

1204
02:12:08,630 --> 02:12:11,630
So, let me just keep it with me,
so you don't get confused.

1205
02:12:12,258 --> 02:12:15,508
This is SOS. Only when required.
- Okay.

1206
02:12:16,387 --> 02:12:18,177
And all the others
are the same.

1207
02:12:19,724 --> 02:12:21,564
It's all here in the box.
- Okay.

1208
02:12:45,959 --> 02:12:46,959
Nothing came of it.

1209
02:12:57,261 --> 02:13:01,141
All that happened… was because you
decided to do something about it.

1210
02:13:20,576 --> 02:13:22,786
It's as good as it gets.

1211
02:13:31,295 --> 02:13:33,585
Did your donor die from
a head injury?

1212
02:13:34,173 --> 02:13:36,013
Yeah, he was a fit young man.

1213
02:13:37,427 --> 02:13:39,257
What's at the museum?

1214
02:13:39,804 --> 02:13:41,394
They are screening some videos…

1215
02:13:41,514 --> 02:13:43,684
that the NGO has gathered
from his family.

1216
02:13:44,017 --> 02:13:45,977
Will you be meeting
his family then?

1217
02:13:46,185 --> 02:13:48,145
No, they have moved
to Dubai, it seems.

1218
02:13:48,396 --> 02:13:49,936
The screening's just for you?

1219
02:13:50,023 --> 02:13:51,823
There are other recipients
as well.

1220
02:13:51,983 --> 02:13:52,983
Others?

1221
02:13:53,109 --> 02:13:56,279
The way I received one kidney, there
must be someone else who got the other one

1222
02:13:56,487 --> 02:13:58,697
and those who received the
heart, the lungs, etc…

1223
02:13:58,781 --> 02:14:01,081
They can transplant so many
organs from one man?

1224
02:14:01,325 --> 02:14:03,325
Yes. Even skin.

1225
02:14:03,870 --> 02:14:04,870
Eyes and ears?

1226
02:14:04,996 --> 02:14:07,576
Eyes, yes.
Not sure about ears.

1227
02:14:07,790 --> 02:14:08,830
Can I come along?

1228
02:14:09,208 --> 02:14:11,338
No, it's only for the recipients.

1229
02:14:12,170 --> 02:14:13,760
They say it's the
first time in the city…

1230
02:14:13,838 --> 02:14:16,588
that eight people have received
organs from the same donor.

1231
02:14:19,052 --> 02:14:21,852
I wonder what it'll be
like, to meet the others…

1232
02:14:25,058 --> 02:14:27,438
we have a part each
from the same person.

1233
02:14:29,353 --> 02:14:31,233
Isn't a man made up of his parts?

1234
02:14:31,689 --> 02:14:32,979
There must be something more…

1235
02:14:33,066 --> 02:14:35,356
Or else, replacing the parts
would change the person.

1236
02:14:35,443 --> 02:14:36,613
Who knows?

1237
02:14:39,906 --> 02:14:41,946
Where did you dirty your shirt?

1238
02:14:42,116 --> 02:14:42,906
Where?

1239
02:14:42,992 --> 02:14:43,992
Look there!

1240
02:14:45,411 --> 02:14:47,871
It's cool.
- Okay, bye.

1241
02:14:50,208 --> 02:14:51,208
Naveen?

1242
02:14:51,626 --> 02:14:54,246
Hi! I am Yuki. I spoke to you
on the phone earlier today.

1243
02:14:54,462 --> 02:14:55,922
Hi. Hope I am not late.

1244
02:14:56,005 --> 02:14:58,045
No, four recipients have reached,
two more are expected…

1245
02:14:58,132 --> 02:14:59,512
then we'll start the
screening.

1246
02:15:00,093 --> 02:15:01,643
Oh! I thought there were
eight of us.

1247
02:15:01,928 --> 02:15:04,758
The man who received the heart
isn't feeling well yet.

1248
02:15:05,181 --> 02:15:08,101
His transplant was successful, but he's
still vulnerable to infection.

1249
02:15:08,559 --> 02:15:09,939
Some organ donation forms…

1250
02:15:10,019 --> 02:15:12,559
Please encourage your friends and
family to pledge their organs.

1251
02:15:12,647 --> 02:15:14,107
Yeah.
- This is for you.

1252
02:15:15,191 --> 02:15:16,611
Ah, you got the left one, right?

1253
02:15:17,985 --> 02:15:20,105
This is Dr. Kaza,
our NGO's chairman.

1254
02:15:21,572 --> 02:15:23,872
Are we watching our
donor's home videos?

1255
02:15:24,283 --> 02:15:26,373
No, he was a hobbyist
cave explorer.

1256
02:15:26,452 --> 02:15:29,212
We'll be watching
some videos shot by him.

1257
02:15:29,413 --> 02:15:31,003
Just have a seat with the
other recipients…

1258
02:15:31,082 --> 02:15:32,632
and please keep your phone
on silent.

1259
02:15:32,708 --> 02:15:34,038
Okay. Thank you.
