5

<i>Bruce Lee</i>
<i>FIST OF FURY</i>

6
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:23,039
Back then
kids worshiped Bruce Lee

7
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:27,144
He was my hero

8
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,252
My friends and I became
close easily

9
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:35,361
because we all had the common bond
of liking Bruce Lee

10
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:46,163
To me, he was the coolest
strongest guy on Earth

11
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:54,378
And I dreamt about becoming
like Bruce Lee

12
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:09,450
<i>Jeet Kune Do doesn't teach you</i>

<i>From Bruce Lee's <'Way of Jeet Kune Do'></i>

Everybody has unforgettable
moments of their lives

15
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:27,040
For me, it was the year 1978

16
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,310
In the spring, we moved
to the Gangnam area of Seoul

17
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:36,013
My mom foresaw real estate prices

18
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,919

Stop pushing, boys
I might get a hard-on

25
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:04,409
Slow down!

26
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:05,813
I transferred

27
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:08,614
to Jungmoon High
on Maljuk Street

28
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:12,324
I'd heard things about it

29
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:16,519
And I hoped they weren't true

30
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:18,324

31
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:22,427

- Piss off!

- Give me your collar
- What?

36
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:36,139
Your collar, dumb ass

37
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:40,184

Don't you worry

78
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:32,224

Can't even solve that?

Come here

95
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,432
You haven't told him about me?

96
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:27,732

97
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:32,537

We'll settle this tomorrow
Get the money ready

99
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,319
Fucking asshole!

100
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:43,422
Give him money if he asks for it

101

Who's he?

102
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,724
He failed a grade
He's like a dog with rabies

103
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,124
When upset
he stabs you with a pen

104
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:53,027
You get prettier by the day

105
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:57,033
How about a movie

106
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:58,136
Hell no

What a bunch of dogs!

109
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:09,047
So fucking homely

111
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,920

113
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:45,810
Hurry on

114
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,315
All right!

115
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:57,820

116
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:00,523
Kick it harder!

117
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,737
You call yourself a man?

118

Don't take your eyes off it
Focus!

00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:27,921
Get up

00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,620
'Nothing is impossible

123
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:33,027
There is nothing you can't do
if you focus

124
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:35,929
Martial arts and studying

125
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:38,832
Make sure you get

126
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,836
within the top five of your class

127
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:44,436
My father ran a Taekwondo gym

128
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:47,546
He was a gentle martial artist
to neighbors

129
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,614
But he was a violent father

130
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:54,815
With me, he preferred using
his fists to words

131
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:23,408
- I won again!
- Won!

132
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:31,817
Stabber, come with me to
the student patrols' office

133
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:32,889
What for?

134
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,324
- You went to the cafeteria
- So?

135
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:39,296
Asshole, you washed your hair
in the water tank

136
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:41,330

137
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:44,732

Get out before I make you

142
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,907
Practiced hoops lately?

143
00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:00,212
Don't you wanna win

144
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:03,617
Go fuck yourself!
Get the hell out

145
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:11,296
Stabber, come to the office
by lunch break

146
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,235
I smell fucking dandruff

147
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:25,437
Dickhead, don't tell me

148
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:26,636
you showered in it, too

149
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:30,608
Shove it up your ass

150
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,717
Let's call it a day

151
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:40,021
I never knew...

152
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:45,028
How painful love can be

153
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:50,227
This fucker is never here
when I collect taxes

154
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:53,236
What are you doing?

155
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:55,932
What am I doing?

156
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:58,635
None of your damn business

157
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:04,709
That's not your bag

158
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:09,014
What the fuck do you care?

159
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:20,826
You're fucking dead

160
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:25,628
Knock it off, asshole

161
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:28,239
- Act your fucking age
- What?

162
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:30,740
Failing a grade isn't a prize

163
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:33,636
Up your ass

164
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:35,144
What?

165
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:37,607
What the...

166
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:42,252
What'd you just say?

167
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:46,354
Say it again

168
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:51,325
Say it again, asshole

169
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,535
Fuck with me again
and I'll bury you

170
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:05,037
An infinitive can be used
as three things

171
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,441
Nouns, adjectives, or adverbs

172
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:12,009
You have no idea, do you?

173
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:18,515
You punks are unteachable

174
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:22,024

Repeat!

175
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:26,425

- Nouns, adjectives, or adverbs

176

What's this?

177
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:37,733
Keep it Stabber would have
taken it anyway

178
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:41,344
I don't want it

179
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,914
It's free, Take it

180
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:48,611
Let me know if you need anything
I'll give you a good deal

181
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,820
- Sorry to bother you, Mr. Kim
- No problem

182
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:55,017
It won't take long

183
00:14:57,763 --> 00:14:59,128
- Let me check your belongings
- We're fucked

184
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:01,825

208
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:40,725

Don't be so difficult, bitch

268
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:04,546
What'd you call me, pig?

269
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:07,158
Fucking bitch!

270
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:12,753
- You're dead!
- You think you're pretty?

271
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:14,365
Are you fucking nuts?

272
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:17,161
Take a walk, bitch

273
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:19,770
Come here!

274
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:22,066
- What's this?
- You fucking homely bitch!

275
00:22:28,313 --> 00:22:29,644
What's going on here?

276
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:30,941
Fuck! Run!

277
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:33,351
Get him!

00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:37,755
Stop right there!

279
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:45,554
They would've killed us

280
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:46,755
What about the others?

281
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:48,263
Who cares?

282
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,765
Should we go back?

283
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:51,562
Hell no

284
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,261
Hamburger, that asshole...

285
00:22:57,809 --> 00:23:00,573
You're a good basketball player

286
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:04,341
Nah, you're better

287
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:08,146
Why do you let Stabber
fuck you around?

288
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:12,654
I don't wanna fight

289
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:14,952
Never been in a fight

290
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:18,153
Throw the first punch

291
00:23:18,296 --> 00:23:21,265
Know what I'm saying?
Hit first

292
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,767
Take the initiative
That's what wins the fight

293
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:29,764
I should go to a military academy

294
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:32,570
Good to be an army general

295
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:35,771
He calls, they let us walk

296
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:39,145
You passed out
when she kicked you

297
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:42,651
What?
Who says I passed out?

298
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:44,050
I came right to

299
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,956
Knocked out by a chick?

300
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,651
I'd choke over that rice
if I were you

301
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:52,764
So I mixed it with water

302
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:56,356
You need to train harder
'The Game of Death'!

303
00:23:56,501 --> 00:23:58,264
Damn, he's at it again

304
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:08,576
- I'll take you all on!
- OK!

305
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,546
That's not it

306
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:18,649
What are you, an over-weight
version of Bruce Lee?

307
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:28,254
Hair...

308
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:42,571
It hurts!

309
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:46,041
Hyun-soo, you're on

310
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:51,547
- She's Bruce's squeeze
- No, Tin Fei is

311
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,658
- Kum-Yong Girls' high school
- Who's that?

312
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:56,352
She was in 'Girls'

313
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,258
Oh, that one

314
00:24:58,396 --> 00:25:01,365
- Let's go to a disco tonight
- You're unbelievable

315
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,162
You have a black eye, man

316
00:25:04,302 --> 00:25:06,270
Chicks there are great

317
00:25:06,404 --> 00:25:08,668
That has nothing to do with you
does it?

318
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:11,071
- You're going, right?
- Sure

319
00:25:13,411 --> 00:25:15,379
- Go for it
- Hey

320
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:16,845
Let me take your bag

321
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:19,542
- No thanks
- Let me

322
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:22,244
- It's okay
- I insist!

323
00:25:22,387 --> 00:25:25,652
Go easy on her, man

324
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:31,160
- That's the chick I told you about?
- Who?

325
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:34,265
Let's see what's in here

326
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:37,664
- What are you doing?
- What?

327
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:38,564
- Pass it to me
- Here, Here!

328
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:41,263
- Hey!
- Give it to me

329
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:44,170
She's got a temper, guys

330
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:45,867
What a cute lunch box!

331
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:48,878
- Give it here!
- No!

332
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:50,743
Hands off, bitch!

333
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:53,248
- Wow, she's feisty
- Give it back!

334
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,546
No tampons?

335
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:57,245
Excuse me

336
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:01,052
Please, give it back to her

337
00:26:01,192 --> 00:26:02,955
What?

338
00:26:03,094 --> 00:26:05,654
It's her bag

339
00:26:05,797 --> 00:26:08,960
Who the fuck are you?
Beat it

340
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,364
You had your fun, didn't you?

341
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:12,663
Hell no

342
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:16,672
Give it back, and we'll talk
Stay back

343
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:19,276
I can't believe this

344
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,379
Have you lost your mind?

345
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:23,140
I'm your senior, and...

346
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:27,046
Son of a bitch!

347
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:33,351
Stop the bus!

348
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:39,458
Get off! All of you!

349
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:44,159
Wait for me!

350
00:26:45,203 --> 00:26:47,068
Fuck!

351
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,371
Stop right there, fuckers!

352
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:55,376
Keep running!

353
00:26:55,513 --> 00:26:56,639
- Stop right there!
- Stop!

354
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:02,653
Let's split

355
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,757
You come with me
Meet us at the bus stop

356
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:11,460
Which way did they go?

357
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:20,972
Stay put here

358
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:22,164
We've gotta go

359
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,775
- I can't
- Come on!

360
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:46,159
Where the fuck did these...

361
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:48,857
They must've gone the other way
Let's go

362
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,274
Get out of there, fuckers

363
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:06,544
- Come out of there
- Fuck!

364
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:07,947
What were you doing there?

365
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:11,852
Making out?
Where's the other two?

366
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,048
Where are they?

367
00:28:20,498 --> 00:28:24,264
He's a Kingpin of our class

368
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:27,860
You know what I mean?
He's a real fighter

369
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:32,067
Once he took on 8 alone
and kicked their asses

370
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,678
I see

371
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:37,441
Sorry if I got you in trouble

372
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:39,049
It's okay

373
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:41,550
A true victory is winning
without using force

374
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:42,948
Hi, boys and girls

375
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:47,457
I'm Jin-woo Jun
Mr Cool on the block

376
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:51,961
Ma'am, noodles
for table number 3, please

377
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:53,564
Boys are not so cute

378
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:56,861
But she's such a hottie

379
00:28:58,603 --> 00:29:00,764
Mr. Cool my fucking ass!

380
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:03,965
Watch your mouth, man

381
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:05,974
What's your name?

382
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:09,376
Name's Eun-ju Kang
I'm a senior

383
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:12,449
Going to college next year?
What do you wanna study?

384
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:18,352
Show me some respect
I know you're a junior

385
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:20,549
We're the same age
I failed a grade

386
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:23,058
His mom is a famous actress

387
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:25,355
Shut the fuck up

388
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:28,364
And his father is a pillar
of the community

389
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:33,369
You didn't fail a grade, did you?
Thanks for earlier

390
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:36,269
I didn't do anything

391
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:37,965
I've seen you before
on the bus

392
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,371
Really?

393
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:42,378
You had the earphones on

394
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:43,947
You must like music

395
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:46,846
Yeah, I like
American pop songs

396
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:48,953
American songs?
That's something

397
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:50,850
Who do you like?

398
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:53,958
Elton John and Celsia Chan

399
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:57,061
And one of the ABBA members
She's blonde

400
00:29:57,195 --> 00:29:59,163
- Oh, that blonde chick...
- Agnetha?

401
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,765
That's right, I like her

402
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,060
Oh, Agne...

403
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:06,563
What are you doing tonight?

404
00:30:06,704 --> 00:30:07,762
Let's go to a disco

405
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:14,769
- Thanks
- Thank you

406
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:16,175
You should've let us pay

407
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:18,249
No, I wanted to

408
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:21,352
I've gotta go now

409
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,647
- Bye
- Bye

410
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:25,346
Thank you so much for today

411
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:30,759
She's leaving like that?

412
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:35,465
I've gotta go
See you

413
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:43,267
That asshole got us
in a big fucking trouble

414
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:45,569
He can't control himself
before cute chicks

415
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:52,543
I bet he's all over her by now
What do you think?

416
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:56,347
That bitch is so uptight

417
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:58,648
'Show me some respect
I know you're a junior'

418
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:02,453
Bye

419
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:05,461
- This bag...
- Your bag, Hyun-soo

420
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:08,964
What's gotten into you?

421
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:12,069
Stop bullshitting me, man

422
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:13,670
I'm not!

423
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:16,069
Doesn't she look like
Olivia Hussey?

424
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:20,166
It's all your fault
she left us like that

425
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:24,138
By the way, I'm so nervous

426
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:26,045
If they come, they come

427
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:29,847
Damn, I should've been there

428
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:34,152
How'd it go with her?

429
00:31:34,292 --> 00:31:36,260
- Did you fuck her?
- What?

430
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:45,663
Who is it?

431
00:31:45,803 --> 00:31:47,566
Those two

432
00:31:49,874 --> 00:31:52,365
that fucking pig!

433
00:31:55,613 --> 00:31:57,843
Get in!
Against the wall

434
00:31:57,982 --> 00:31:58,949
Against the wall!

435
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:04,145
Better bite your teeth hard

436
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:06,553
- Put them down, man
- Fuckface!

437
00:32:10,395 --> 00:32:14,559
- You can do better than that
- Hit harder!

438
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:15,666
That's it!

439
00:32:18,002 --> 00:32:20,266
You're famous on Maljuk, huh?

440
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:23,863
You're such a big shot?
Hit me again

441
00:32:24,008 --> 00:32:25,669
Hit me again, fucker

442
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:30,042
Hit me if you can
Come on

443
00:33:17,695 --> 00:33:19,162
Come on, motherfuckers!

444
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:25,761
You should've kept your cool

445
00:33:25,903 --> 00:33:29,771
Once I let them fuck with me
I'm through, man

446
00:33:36,814 --> 00:33:39,282
Let me apologize again

447
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:42,386
He's just hot-blooded
Don't worry

448
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,387
- Take good care of my son
- Sure

449
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:48,492
- Thanks, Goodbye
- Bye

450
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:53,188
Thanks to his mom
Woo-sik didn't get suspended

451
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:54,696
She starred in TV dramas

452
00:33:54,832 --> 00:33:57,801
Mostly as a kitchen maid

453
00:33:57,935 --> 00:34:00,403
- That's Maid Bong!
- Yes, Maid Bong

454
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:03,996
After that incident
Woo-sik became famous

455
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:05,609
And seniors left him alone

456
00:34:05,743 --> 00:34:10,373
You fight again and
I'm telling your dad

457
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:11,647
- Hamburger
- Yeah?

458
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:14,478
Delivery to the stationery shop

459
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,148
- I'll be right back
- Thanks

460
00:34:19,323 --> 00:34:21,314
I can't believe that idiot

461
00:34:22,026 --> 00:34:24,494
She's not gonna give it to him

462
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:25,596
Leave him alone

463
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:31,190
How are things going with her?

464
00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:32,700
Who?

465
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:34,805
You know... Eun-ju

466
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:36,201
Her?

467
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:39,002
That bitch turns me off

468
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:39,700
Why?

469
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:44,975
Let me tell you
She's one hard nut to crack

470
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:46,481
Really?

471
00:34:46,617 --> 00:34:49,780
I thought she liked you

472
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,786
I went after her that day

473
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:56,087
but she just blew me off
She's just too uptight

474
00:34:56,227 --> 00:34:59,993
Why do you ask?

475
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:02,395
I was just curious

476
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:04,899
You like her?

477
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:06,503
Then, go for it

478
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:09,606
- No way
- Sorry to keep you waiting

479
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,799
I haven't seen you for ages

480
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,707
I think you get prettier
by the day

481
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:16,973
Really?

482
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,583
You look skinnier, Hyun-soo

483
00:35:19,717 --> 00:35:21,582
- I do?
- Yes

484
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:23,687
Because I haven't eaten your
seasoned rice cakeslately?

485
00:35:23,821 --> 00:35:26,881
I'm not kidding
I think you've lost weight

486
00:35:27,024 --> 00:35:30,187
Drop by anytime you want

487
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:32,888
I'll make it special for you

488
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:35,089
For free?

489
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:39,693
Of course!
Your money isn't good here

490
00:35:39,837 --> 00:35:43,102
Wait, Let me get you boys
some fritters

491
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:44,299
On the house

492
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:34,978
I can't let this chance go by

493
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:38,282
Be a man, Hyun-soo

494
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,583
Here's your chance

495
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:42,784
Muster up the courage

496
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,792
Call her
Now!

497
00:37:57,541 --> 00:37:59,304
- Go with me
- Hurry up!

498
00:38:12,823 --> 00:38:15,291
I knew it was you
Hi, Hyun-soo

499
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:17,087
Hi

500
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:18,195
How did you...

501
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:21,298
I thought I saw you
so I came running

502
00:38:21,432 --> 00:38:24,299
- to make sure
- I see

503
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:27,097
It's been a while
How have you been?

504
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:29,206
Fine, How about you?

505
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,398
Good

506
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:35,305
What number
do you take home?

507
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:37,573
Bus 78

508
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:39,683
I take that one, too

509
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:41,785
We can go together then

510
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:44,080
That's great

511
00:38:44,221 --> 00:38:47,679
How'd you recognize me?

512
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:51,488
Are you kidding?
We ran together Remember?

513
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:52,687
Right!

514
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:56,898
You go to this institute?

515
00:38:57,034 --> 00:38:59,093
Huh?

516
00:38:59,236 --> 00:39:00,897
Yeah

517
00:39:01,038 --> 00:39:04,007
Never seen you here before

518
00:39:04,141 --> 00:39:05,108
Me neither

519
00:39:08,446 --> 00:39:10,073
Did you have dinner?

520
00:39:10,214 --> 00:39:11,272
Not yet

521
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:20,083
You can use this

522
00:39:20,224 --> 00:39:21,987
No, it's okay

523
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:26,290
Go ahead
You might catch a cold

524
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:27,988
I'm okay

525
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:29,099
Thanks

526
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:34,195
It's Chelsia Chan

527
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:38,535
Wasn't it hard to run with me?

528
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:40,904
Not at all, It was fun

529
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:43,445
Fun?

530
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:47,678
Not for me
I was so scared of that rat

531
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:48,919
So was I

532
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:54,179
Shame on your seniors

533
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:58,489
Didn't they retaliate
against you and Woo-sik?

534
00:39:58,629 --> 00:39:59,596
No

535
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:05,493
Woo-sik is cool, isn't he?
Such a tough guy

536
00:40:05,636 --> 00:40:08,503
But he's got no manners

537
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:10,402
You're different

538
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:11,508
Am I?

539
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:21,585
Your mouth...

540
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:34,891
You like music, right?

541
00:40:35,032 --> 00:40:38,001
What's your favorite
radio program?

542
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:40,801
'Love Songs of Eve'

543
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:43,099
That's my favorite, too!

544
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:45,540
I even sent a postcard, too

545
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:47,775
But, they never
aired my request

546
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:50,177
You only wrote down your request?

547
00:40:50,314 --> 00:40:52,077
Yeah

548
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:56,585
Next time, draw something cute

549
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,086
Or paste a flower on it

550
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:00,884
That always works

551
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:04,392
Really?
Have you done it?

552
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:05,495
No

553
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:09,995
I will, when I have a girlfriend

554
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,694
Oh, that's so sweet

555
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:20,601
<i>It's been a year</i>
<i>since we broke up</i>

556
00:41:20,744 --> 00:41:22,769
<i>When it rains, I keep thinking...</i>

557
00:41:22,913 --> 00:41:25,381
Did you listen to it last night?

558
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:27,784
No, I didn't

559
00:41:27,918 --> 00:41:31,786
'Runway' was on the air
singing live

560
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:33,480
Really?

561
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:37,287
I'm sorry I missed it

562
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:39,953
<i>- Feelings - by Morris Albert'</i>

563
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:47,203
The guitar is great in this song

564
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:52,901
Yeah, It sounds even better
on a rainy day

565
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:54,704
Do you play the guitar?

566
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:56,210
Huh?

567
00:41:58,115 --> 00:41:59,514
A little bit

568
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:01,778
That's cool

569
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:05,279
Good enough
to be in a competition?

570
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:08,885
No, not that good

571
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:10,584
I'd like to hear you play
some day

572
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:15,196
You mean it?

573
00:42:15,332 --> 00:42:16,390
Sure

574
00:42:29,813 --> 00:42:31,178
I'm getting off here

575
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:34,680
It was so nice seeing you

576
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:35,785
It really was

577
00:42:42,026 --> 00:42:44,790
- You can take this
- No, I'm okay

578
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:47,295
Take it, I can run home

579
00:42:47,431 --> 00:42:49,490
- No, I'm okay
- Please

580
00:42:50,134 --> 00:42:51,192
Bye

581
00:42:52,836 --> 00:42:53,803
Hyun-soo!

582
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:50,685
How am I gonna live
with you gone...

583
00:43:50,828 --> 00:43:53,490
What's up with you?

584
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:54,791
Got laid or something?

585
00:43:56,834 --> 00:43:59,098
I might get into a competition

586
00:43:59,236 --> 00:44:02,694
I'd be damned if you did

587
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:07,800
I can't live without you
Please, don't go...

588
00:44:07,945 --> 00:44:12,075
Stop selling these, man

589
00:44:12,216 --> 00:44:14,377
You'll pay my tuition then?

590
00:44:14,518 --> 00:44:16,179
Did you bring it?

591
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,788
'Horse Penis' and 'Honey Jar'

592
00:44:18,922 --> 00:44:19,980
Good

593
00:44:21,925 --> 00:44:23,893
Stop jacking off into the book

594
00:44:24,028 --> 00:44:26,292
Fuck you

595
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:27,988
Getting a hard-on?

596
00:44:28,132 --> 00:44:30,999
Shake it hard, baby

597
00:44:31,135 --> 00:44:35,538
You guys are pathetic
What are you, his bank?

598
00:44:37,541 --> 00:44:39,168
Eat it

599
00:44:40,077 --> 00:44:42,910
This is awesome!

600
00:44:43,113 --> 00:44:45,980
If you keep reading those
I bet you'll never get laid

601
00:44:46,116 --> 00:44:47,879
You'll jack off to death

602
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,485
I don'tjack off any more

603
00:44:53,624 --> 00:44:56,286
He's pouting again

604
00:44:56,427 --> 00:44:58,088
Want some?

605
00:44:58,228 --> 00:45:00,788
Why'd you miss school yesterday?

606
00:45:00,931 --> 00:45:02,398
I was sick

607
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,592
What happened to your hand?

608
00:45:04,735 --> 00:45:05,793
Got into a fight again?

609
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:08,596
No way

610
00:45:11,341 --> 00:45:13,309
Our politics had been abusing

611
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:18,074
Western democracy

612
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:20,376
Revitalizing Reform was put to
an end to this...

613
00:45:20,517 --> 00:45:24,977
Not now, asshole

614
00:45:25,122 --> 00:45:26,384
Put it away!

615
00:45:29,326 --> 00:45:34,389
Its meaning can be
boiled down to 5 things

616
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:37,398
Give it here

617
00:45:37,534 --> 00:45:39,502
What's going on back there?

618
00:45:39,636 --> 00:45:41,194
Bring it up here

619
00:45:47,845 --> 00:45:48,812
What's this?

620
00:45:48,946 --> 00:45:51,210
'Horse Penis and Wet Pussy'?

621
00:45:53,217 --> 00:45:54,184
Smiling?

622
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:59,683
You ducked?
A huge mistake, punk

623
00:45:59,823 --> 00:46:02,690
- I'm just...
- Bite your teeth hard

624
00:46:02,826 --> 00:46:04,885
Bite them hard!

625
00:46:05,028 --> 00:46:07,189
You useless bastard

626
00:46:07,331 --> 00:46:09,697
What the...

627
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:11,198
Staring at me?

628
00:46:11,335 --> 00:46:12,996
Son of a bitch!

629
00:46:13,137 --> 00:46:16,402
Stand straight
Is that your book?

630
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:17,598
No, sir

631
00:46:18,542 --> 00:46:21,409
Then whose?

632
00:46:21,545 --> 00:46:23,570
Say it!

633
00:46:23,714 --> 00:46:26,683
You're really gonna get it

634
00:46:26,817 --> 00:46:28,478
It's Hamburger's

635
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,086
Hamburger?

636
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:31,881
Jaebok Ham

637
00:46:32,022 --> 00:46:33,785
Who's Jaebok Ham?

638
00:46:33,924 --> 00:46:36,893
Get your ass up here!

639
00:46:37,027 --> 00:46:38,187
God damn it!

640
00:46:42,032 --> 00:46:42,999
Is this yours?

641
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:45,294
Open your mouth

642
00:46:45,435 --> 00:46:47,300
Do you ever study?

643
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:54,106
Sons of bitches like you
do democracy no good

644
00:46:54,244 --> 00:46:55,211
You stinking dog!

645
00:46:55,345 --> 00:46:57,779
Because I don't have a general
for a father?

646
00:46:57,915 --> 00:47:00,679
How could he rat on me?

647
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:03,286
I've been carrying his bag
for over 3 years

648
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:04,785
What's gonna happen to you?

649
00:47:04,922 --> 00:47:07,584
Beats me
I hope they don't expel me

650
00:47:07,724 --> 00:47:10,693
I'm not going to let him
get away with this

651
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:11,795
Hamburger!

652
00:47:14,932 --> 00:47:15,899
Hey, bitch!

653
00:47:18,936 --> 00:47:21,097
Go say sorry

654
00:47:21,238 --> 00:47:23,604
It was his, wasn't it?

655
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:26,504
Oh, I almost forgot

656
00:47:26,643 --> 00:47:27,610
Your umbrella

657
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:33,482
You go to the same institute
with her?

658
00:47:33,617 --> 00:47:35,585
She asked me to thank you
for her

659
00:47:38,622 --> 00:47:39,680
You met her?

660
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:44,289
You know I never give up

661
00:47:44,428 --> 00:47:46,794
You know what happened?

662
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:52,300
I put on a show the other night
She was so difficult

663
00:47:52,436 --> 00:47:53,903
I followed her for a few days

664
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:55,800
When it rained the other night

665
00:47:55,939 --> 00:47:59,102
I staked out her place

666
00:47:59,243 --> 00:48:02,303
About 1 in the morning
she comes out of the house

667
00:48:02,446 --> 00:48:06,382
And she feels sorry for me
soaked to the bones

668
00:48:06,516 --> 00:48:08,677
Then I see the chance

669
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:11,879
I punch the wall real hard

670
00:48:12,022 --> 00:48:13,785
Blood all over my hand...

671
00:48:15,525 --> 00:48:17,993
You should've seen the look
on her face

672
00:48:18,128 --> 00:48:21,188
She brings out a bandage
and wraps up my hand

673
00:48:21,331 --> 00:48:23,799
Didn't that feel great!

674
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:26,095
So I say to her...

675
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:30,306
'I could die for you'

676
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:32,601
Next minute, she's all mine

677
00:48:37,814 --> 00:48:41,978
Woo-sik got so easily
what I'd desired so badly

678
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,984
All I could do for Eun-ju was...

679
00:48:47,124 --> 00:48:49,524
share an umbrella

680
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:03,306
Hey, wake up

681
00:49:08,345 --> 00:49:09,209
Hey

682
00:49:09,346 --> 00:49:10,677
Still sleeping?

683
00:49:10,814 --> 00:49:14,580
- Did you run into Eun-ju
on your way in? /- No

684
00:49:14,718 --> 00:49:17,585
Don't tell her I slept

685
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:18,483
Why not?

686
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:20,988
I promised to give her a buck
each time I sleep here

687
00:49:27,331 --> 00:49:30,494
I think she's good for you

688
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:31,191
Why's that?

689
00:49:33,236 --> 00:49:36,694
Look at you
You're at the library

690
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:40,503
So tiring to date a model student

691
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:42,407
She gets upset if I go to a disco

692
00:49:48,018 --> 00:49:50,680
My mom likes her, though

693
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:53,984
Damn, I miss dating sluts

694
00:49:54,124 --> 00:49:56,183
Woo-sik, put that out

695
00:49:58,428 --> 00:49:59,486
Hey there

696
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:02,195
Hi

697
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:04,493
Hey, When'd you get here?

698
00:50:04,634 --> 00:50:05,692
Just now

699
00:50:06,737 --> 00:50:09,399
He slept again, didn't he?

700
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:11,097
I didn't

701
00:50:11,241 --> 00:50:13,709
I don't believe you

702
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,903
Open your hand

703
00:50:16,046 --> 00:50:16,876
Go ahead

704
00:50:20,717 --> 00:50:23,185
Happy birthday

705
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,880
You didn't have to do this
What is it?

706
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:30,289
A cassette tape, I had songs
recorded at the record shop

707
00:50:30,427 --> 00:50:31,894
Dance music?

708
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:34,088
Is that all you think about?

709
00:50:36,133 --> 00:50:37,100
It's your birthday?

710
00:50:38,635 --> 00:50:39,897
Why didn't you tell me?

711
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:42,301
It's not important

712
00:50:42,439 --> 00:50:43,497
Happy birthday

713
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:46,907
I'll leave you guys alone

714
00:50:50,313 --> 00:50:52,474
Where are you going?
Come with us

715
00:50:52,616 --> 00:50:53,776
No, I'm okay

716
00:51:09,533 --> 00:51:11,899
What's wrong with Hyun-soo?

717
00:51:12,035 --> 00:51:13,400
He doesn't like dancing

718
00:51:14,538 --> 00:51:15,800
I'll bring him out

719
00:51:17,641 --> 00:51:19,609
Why aren't you dancing?

720
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,404
Come on, dance with us

721
00:51:21,545 --> 00:51:22,978
I'm not a good dancer

722
00:51:23,113 --> 00:51:25,581
Neither am I

723
00:51:25,715 --> 00:51:27,080
Have you been here before?

724
00:51:27,217 --> 00:51:28,878
Once with Woo-sik

725
00:51:29,019 --> 00:51:32,887
- He's a regular here, isn't he?
- No

726
00:51:33,023 --> 00:51:36,288
- You don't think I'm bad, do you?
- Why?

727
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:39,486
Cause I'm at a disco
when I should be studying

728
00:51:39,629 --> 00:51:41,790
Don't you wanna dance?

729
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:45,493
Sit next to him

730
00:51:45,635 --> 00:51:47,899
- Let's dance
- No

731
00:51:48,038 --> 00:51:49,005
Let's go

732
00:51:54,344 --> 00:51:55,811
You like this song?

733
00:51:59,015 --> 00:52:02,644
I hardly listen to Korean songs
but this one's great

734
00:52:05,021 --> 00:52:08,684
She's cute
Hook her up with Hyun-soo

735
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:10,888
Wanna dance?

736
00:53:36,112 --> 00:53:37,079
Who is it?

737
00:53:39,516 --> 00:53:40,574
Oh, Hyun-soo

738
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:44,382
- Hi
- What are you doing here?

739
00:53:46,423 --> 00:53:49,881
- Can I have some rice cake?
- Sure, Sit down

740
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:55,389
Wanna drink?

741
00:53:55,532 --> 00:53:58,296
Huh?
No thanks

742
00:53:58,435 --> 00:54:00,300
Go ahead

743
00:54:00,437 --> 00:54:02,098
You're old enough to drink

744
00:54:07,644 --> 00:54:09,771
Studying is stressful, isn't it?

745
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:11,278
That's what I do, though

746
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:18,885
You sure can drink

747
00:54:21,224 --> 00:54:23,886
What's bothering you?

748
00:54:26,129 --> 00:54:28,791
Problems with your girlfriend?
