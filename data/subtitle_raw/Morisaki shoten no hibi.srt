1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000


3
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:35,230


4
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:39,140
Hard to describe that feeling, 
it makes you feel so at ease.

5
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:41,200


6
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:44,000
By the way, do you know 
a Western restaurant called "Little Puppet"?

7
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:44,000
"Little Puppet" refers to a traditional 
toy from the Tohoku region in Japan.

8
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:47,220
Y記

9
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,210
Even though it has "Little Puppet" in its name

10
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:49,220
the restaurant doesn't 
have any puppets displayed.

11
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:53,230


12
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:53,000
Their omelette rice is especially delicious.

13
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,580
Hey, are you even listening?

14
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,080
You spaced out!

15
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,460
I'm starting. Forgot about it.

16
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:07,390
Oh, by the way...

17
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:12,790
Recently, I watched a DVD called 
"Blade Runner." Have you heard of it?

18
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:14,920
Oh, the one you mentioned before.

19
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,030
Oh, did I mention it?

20
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:16,780
You did, 
you did.

21
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:17,650
Yes, yes.

22
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:19,330
Did you watch it?

23
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:25,370
I did. 
It's a sci-fi film from 20 years ago.

24
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:27,940
I'm not really into sci-fi movies.

25
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:32,210
It's different. 
You have to consider it was made 20 years ago.

26
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:33,940
Let's go watch it together next time.

27
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,240
Watch it twice.

28
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,710
Watch it as many times as you want, 
it's still not enough.

29
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:39,400
Really?

30
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,890
"Blade Runner," huh?

31
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,450
I'm not great at borrowing DVDs myself.

32
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:51,560
Long time no see. Happy birthday!

33
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:03,570
Oh, by the way, 
I'm getting married.

34
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,530
What?

35
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:11,470
I'm getting married.

36
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:18,770
Marriage? 
You're getting married?

37
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:24,170
Yeah, next year, 
I'm planning to get married.

38
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:29,150
Who is with whom?

39
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:32,580
I am with my girlfriend.

40
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:39,880
Who? 
Who is your girlfriend?

41
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,210
It's the one from 
the Sales Department, Murata.

42
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:57,260
Do you want to come to 
my place tonight for some activity?

43
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,370
Next,

44
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:36,020
What should we do?

45
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:40,920
We are still open.

46
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,150
Welcome, please come in.

47
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,640
The boss is quite troubled.

48
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:54,370
It's a common thing. 
Without setting proper prices, it won't work.

49
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:57,450
This time, we got some good books in.

50
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,970
I'm constantly annoyed, 
and the troubles keep coming.

51
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:08,620
By the way, we also got the books 
Mr. Sabu requested. Take a look.

52
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,330
Found it! 
Thank you so much.

53
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:18,420
But, if Mr. Sabu buys too many books, 
won't his wife get angry?

54
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:25,590
No problem. She lost one before, 
so now it's fine even if i buys a lot.

55
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,900
So, how many bookmarks do you want?

56
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:33,160
I'll take five.

57
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,250
Five bookmarks, 
here you go.

58
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,320
I still want to make pork cutlet curry.

59
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,840
If you have spare time, 
can you teach me?

60
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,560
You really say things like Li.

61
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,260
-Really?
-Yes.

62
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:23,130
Why does it break again? 
We just fixed it a few days ago.

63
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,440
It's not working.

64
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,300
Now it's completely broken.

65
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:33,880
Mr. Takeuchi, sorry to bother you, 
but can you take a look at it? -No, no need.

66
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,960
Sorry, let me move aside.

67
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:40,180
Mr. Takeuchi is good at repairing machines.

68
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,540
Hello, Mom.

69
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:42,620
Takako.

70
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:44,000
Yes?

71
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,080
Are you okay?

72
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:48,180
Yes.

73
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,260
You finally got into a company after so much effort.

74
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:56,620
Yes.

75
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:02,110
This can't go on like this.

76
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:06,360
Yes, I know.

77
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,290
Hello, this is Morisaki Bookstore.

78
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,360
Satoru?

79
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,090
Oh, it's my sister. 
Long time no see.

80
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,130
How have you been?

81
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:58,850
Me? I'm doing well. 
Why did you suddenly call?

82
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:22,450
Playing back the message.

83
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:27,960
Takako, are you okay? 
It's me, Uncle Satoru.

84
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:33,600
I'm at the bookstore. 
Remember to call me back.

85
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:38,460
A customer has come in. 
So, bye for now.

86
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,350
Satoru.

87
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,790
Satoru?

88
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,210
Satoru..

89
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:27,780
Hello, this is Morisaki Bookstore.

90
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,980
Is this Uncle Satoru? 
It's Takako.

91
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:37,480
Oh, long time no see. 
Are you doing okay?

92
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:40,220
Yes, I'm fine.

93
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:46,950
Really? I knew you came to Tokyo a while ago. 
Why didn't you come to see me?

94
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:50,950
I'm sorry, I've been busy with work.

95
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:54,180
But you quit your job, right?

96
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,270
I've been thinking about it.

97
00:10:56,270 --> 00:11:00,210
If you don't want to find a job right away, 
why not come over to my place?

98
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,360
Huh?

99
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:05,870
Water and electricity bills 
can be quite a burden, right?

100
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,510
If you come here, it's all free.

101
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:12,180
Of course, if you can help out at the store, 
it would be a huge favor for me.

102
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,540
You suddenly say this...

103
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:20,920
You see, right now, I'm the only one taking 
care of the store, and my back isn't in great shape.

104
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,420
When I go to the hospital, 
it would be great to have someone look after the store.

105
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:31,110
There's a room on the second floor of 
the store with a bathroom and shower.

106
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:33,200
You can use it freely.

107
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:37,290
Outside of business hours, 
I go back to my nearby home. How about it?

108
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:42,700
What do you mean, how about it? 
You're asking me to come...

109
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:03,440
Satoru.

110
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:14,340
Here's a map of 
the area around Morisaki Bookstore.

111
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:22,510
Here, take it.

112
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:25,480
Not bad, huh? 
Let's see what it says.

113
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:37,040
- Ah, so it's a map. 
- Oh, I see.

114
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:48,850
Shoes, stairs, one's own home, fireworks, keys, table,

115
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:54,050
textbooks, treasure chest, 
and then it's red envelopes.

116
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:55,840
A treasure map, huh?

117
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,570
Exactly.

118
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,850
Seems quite interesting.

119
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:00,090
Really? Good luck with your search.

120
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,730
Takako.

121
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,020
Long time no see.

122
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,500
It's been about eight years, right?

123
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:48,670
That long? 
You've grown up.

124
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:49,560
Is that so?

125
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,600
Yes.

126
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,590
come in.

127
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:53,430
Alright.

128
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:56,000
Come in quickly.

129
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,180
Sorry.

130
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:09,730
No worries.

131
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:23,860
There's a musty smell.

132
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:29,340
Like the morning after rain. 
I like this dampness.

133
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,650
Excuse me.

134
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:36,060
How many books are here?

135
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:41,160
Um... about five... six thousand, I think.

136
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,090
Six thousand? 
That's a lot.

137
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:46,840
That's actually not much. 
My shop is small.

138
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,250
Takako, why don't you go upstairs?

139
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:53,750
Alright.

140
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:58,920
Put your luggage up there.

141
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,250
Thank you.

142
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,790
Don't mention it, please.

143
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,650
What's going on here?

144
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:18,210
I twisted my back three days ago.

145
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,080
Don't worry; 
I've already cleaned up most of it.

146
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:25,180
Really?

147
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:30,360
Takako sorry for the trouble.

148
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,840
Just move some books and you can stay.

149
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:39,060
Move some books?

150
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,700
Where to?

151
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,940
There's always a way.

152
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:46,180
What do you mean by "always"?

153
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:07,700
Let's get to work.

154
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,580
Oh no!

155
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,980
Welcome.

156
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,720
Thank you for your patronage.

157
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,900
Thank you for your patronage.

158
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,800
welcome.

159
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,680
welcome.

160
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,210
Where's Mr. Satoru?

161
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,050
On another note, who are you?

162
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,030
Are you working here?

163
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:49,110
But this place can't afford to hire anyone.

164
00:24:49,730 --> 00:25:01,700
No, I mean, I work... 
Uncle will be back at 1 o'clock in the afternoon.

165
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:10,300
Seriously, Mr. Satoru is unexpectedly 
adorable with such a lovely niece.

166
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:18,160
Today, I want to read some 
Shiga Nagoya after a long time.

167
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:25,270
The ones I bought before were 
misplaced by my wife.

168
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,660
Is that so?

169
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:33,790
Which of Shiga Nagoya's 
works do you like?

170
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:40,260
I haven't read any.

171
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:47,200
You don't read books?

172
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,190
It's not like I don't read at all.

173
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:57,910
Then why don't you read?

174
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,480
I'm sorry.

175
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:07,500
Let me tell you, if you continue like this, 
you'll only see the surface of the world.

176
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,500
If you don't want to be shallow,

177
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:19,320
read some of these wonderful books here.

178
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:22,030
Alright.

179
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,910
I must say, Shiga Naoya..

180
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:31,500
Yes?

181
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:39,730
He wrote many excellent novels 
during the Taisho and Showa eras.

182
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,310
They didn't mention that in the textbooks, did they?

183
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,550
Naoya Shiga?

184
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:48,860
He was a member of a literary school 
called the "White Birch School"...

185
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,640
Good morning.

186
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,850
It's Uncle.

187
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:04,980
Takako, you look quite relaxed there.

188
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,490
I'm just sitting here, that's all.

189
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:09,540
Is everything going smoothly?

190
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,150
Yes.

191
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:16,940
Mostly fine, e
xcept that a talkative old man came by.

192
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:21,180
Ah, Mr. Sabu, 
a regular customer for 20 years.

193
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:22,690
What did he talk to you about?

194
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,870
It was related to Shiga Naoya.

195
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:32,300
Really? He genuinely loves 
Japan's literary giants.

196
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:36,590
But he talks too much, 
and sometimes, it gets annoying.

197
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:40,970
Oh, by the way, pour him some tea, 
nod a few times, and he'll leave on his own.

198
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:43,310
Mmm... Mmm.

199
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:46,550
Alright, let's change shifts. 
You've worked hard.

200
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,730
It's no problem.

201
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,960
Uncle, I wanted to tell you...

202
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,460
Yes?

203
00:27:55,030 --> 00:28:03,450
Is the store doing okay? There are no 
Visitors at all, and people only buy cheap books.

204
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,330
Nowadays, old books don't sell well.

205
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:09,910
Did they sell well before?

206
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,630
In my father's generation, 
there was a market for old books.

207
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,190
During that time, publishing companies 
weren't as active, and there was no television to watch.

208
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:23,360
But nowadays, I also sell books online. Occasionally,
 I sell some rare books for tens of thousands of dollars.

209
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:30,500
Yes, there are books that 
cost tens of thousands of yuan.

210
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,050
Yes, don't you like to 
visit secondhand bookstores?

211
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:38,310
Don't you visit secondhand bookstores?

212
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,830
Not really.

213
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:45,250
I go to BookOff sometimes; they have manga there.

214
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:45,250
(BookOff is a large chain of secondhand bookstores in Japan.)

215
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:47,010
I see, I get it now.

216
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:54,500
But, you see, 
many people love the old books here.

217
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:56,900
There is a lack of affection for old books

218
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:01,250
But, you see, many people 
love the old books here.

219
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,330
Even adults like you, Takako.

220
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:10,470
Feel free to pick any book you like from here.

221
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:14,050
Alright.

222
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:33,820
People who know about these things understand,
 but there are also many who don't.

223
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:38,550
In that case...

224
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:57,110
Takako, , I brought some snacks. 
Would you like some?

225
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:08,870
I'm coming up.

226
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:58,840
Takako, are you up?

227
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,690
I'm sleeping.

228
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:06,500
People who are asleep don't answer, you know.

229
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:11,110
I want to go somewhere now.
Do you want to come with me?

230
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,330
Huh?

231
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:17,300
I won't do anything bad, okay?

232
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,580
Let's go then.

233
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:44,600
This place...

234
00:34:47,930 --> 00:34:49,010
Smells so good.

235
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:53,440
Good evening, sorry to disturb you.

236
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:55,480
Hello, welcome.

237
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:57,440
boss.

238
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:00,960
Let me introduce you. 
This is my niece, Takako.

239
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:02,490
Good evening.

240
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:04,540
Please have a seat.

241
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:08,520
This shop is really good

242
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:12,350
This shop has been owned 
by the boss for about 30 years.

243
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:13,270
Really?

244
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,250
Good evening, Mr. Morisaki.

245
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:22,530
This is my niece, Takako.

246
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:23,500
Good evening.

247
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,430
Good evening.

248
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:26,410
Tomoko is also a regular visitor at our shop.

249
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:28,120
She's the type who looks but doesn't buy.

250
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:30,530
That's not true.

251
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:33,940
Please give me a mixed coffee.

252
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:34,490
Sure.

253
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,680
I'll have the same.

254
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,310
Boss, where's Tanako?

255
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:45,850
Tanako?

256
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:51,900
Takano, this is my niece, Takako.

257
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:53,450
Good evening.

258
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:54,230
Good evening.

259
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:58,520
By the way, Tanako, you should 
go out with Takako next time.

260
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,780
Uncle, what are you talking about?

261
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:05,450
When you go back to college, you might visit as a working adult, and the feeling may be different...
Why do you say that? Because I'm also growing up, and though I look forward to it, I feel a bit anxious too.

262
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:05,340
Let me ask you, Uncle.

263
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:06,320
Yes?

264
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:13,360
What was Uncle doing when he was my age?

265
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:22,260
Me? I was always reading books and traveling.

266
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:23,580
Traveling?

267
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:24,280
Yes

268
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,880
backpacked through many countries.

269
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:41,270
Thailand, Laos, India, Nepal, I even went around
 Europe while working and saving money.

270
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,110
I have no idea.

271
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,160
It's quite surprising, isn't it?

272
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:48,140
Yes.

273
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,960
But is it reasonable?

274
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:56,600
Why do you keep traveling?

275
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,470
What do you mean?

276
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:05,050
I want to use my own 
eyes to see different worlds,

277
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:10,990
and also to explore my own possibilities.

278
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,160
Possibilities?

279
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:21,840
It's a time when you stop imitating others 
and start searching for your own direction in life.

280
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,870
Impressive.

281
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:30,440
Is it?

282
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:35,190
But I often make my dad angry.

283
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:41,200
I ask him, "Have you found anything on your journey?"

284
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:50,950
You can say I found something,
or maybe, probably, possibly, I haven't found anything.

285
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:53,000
What kind of words are those?

286
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:59,420
During my journey, my dad fell ill and 
passed away. Then, I inherited the family shop.

287
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:03,810
Is that so?

288
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,100
Do you have any regrets?

289
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:13,560
No, I feel like I'm most 
suited for this profession.

290
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,080
That's great.

291
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,250
Hmm?

292
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:30,200
Living life the way you like.

293
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:32,830
It's not exactly like that.

294
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:36,600
Even now, it's full of worries.

295
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:45,700
Your mixed coffee.

296
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:46,980
Alright,

297
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:47,980
thank you.

298
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,220
I'm starting.

299
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:02,570
It tastes good.

300
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,370
The boss's coffee is truly unique.

301
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:18,470


302
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:38,530
Special service, please.

303
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:40,310
Can I do it?

304
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:41,890
No problem.

305
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:44,710
Thank you.

306
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:48,590
Takako, is it your first time here today?

307
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,170
Yes, I haven't visited until now.

308
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:58,420
That's good. 
Please enjoy your life in Jimbocho.

309
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,370
What's wrong?

310
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,430
Uncle said the same thing to you.

311
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:13,890
Of course, 
no one loves this place more than he does.

312
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:20,820
Although he has experienced 
so much, he has never left.

313
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:15,030
Ah.

314
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:18,570
What's wrong?

315
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:38,830
I feel like I'm wasting time.

316
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:40,230
Huh?

317
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:50,610
I haven't done anything recently.

318
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:57,420
That's not true.

319
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:00,820
You need some rest now.

320
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:06,840
The boat you sailed is 
anchored on this street now.

321
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:12,200
Take your time to rest and 
then set sail again, isn't that good?

322
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:31,720
Hmm.

323
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:37,870
But Uncle also complains 
about me sleeping too much.

324
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:47,680
Alright, let's stop talking about it. Let's go.

325
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:52,760
Takako, are you coming?

326
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:19,040
Let's go.

327
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:46,640
Dream Memory, Kazuo Oizumi.

328
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:22,520
No matter what appears before our eyes, a part or all of our souls will be infused into it.
This quote is from "A Scene in the Heart" by Motojiro Kajii.

329
00:48:03,650 --> 00:48:05,240
This is the first time I've seen this book.

330
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:16,010
I never knew this city had such a place.

331
00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:23,480
There are over 170 bookstores here alone.

332
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:28,970
The world's number one old book street.

333
00:49:29,570 --> 00:49:31,040
Number one in the world?

334
00:49:35,470 --> 00:49:39,260
Yes, there are really many bookstores.

335
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:48,560
Each store has its own unique charm,

336
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:59,220
and they are all different and colorful. 
It's wonderful.

337
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:20,860
Uncle, can I borrow this book for a moment?

338
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:22,980
Oh that's fine

339
00:50:23,410 --> 00:50:24,360
Oh, okay then. 
I'm heading out now.

340
00:51:09,390 --> 00:51:10,310
Hello.

341
00:51:14,170 --> 00:51:15,150
Hello.

342
00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:16,550
Are you on the morning shift today?

343
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:20,930
No, I have classes today. 
I only come when I have free time.

344
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:23,250
I see.

345
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:27,220
If you don't mind...

346
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:30,130
thanks.

347
00:51:35,110 --> 00:51:36,600
What's your major?

348
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,110
Japanese literature.

349
00:51:38,910 --> 00:51:42,030
Wow, that's impressive.

350
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:44,370
why?

351
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:51,590
Because I still don't understand 
anything about literature.

352
00:51:54,550 --> 00:51:58,750
Are you in college?

353
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:01,370
No, I've already graduated.

354
00:52:02,290 --> 00:52:10,480
I studied design and worked 
at a design company, but I quit now.

355
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:19,700
Oh, but design is great, 
and many people admire it.

356
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:21,150
Why?

357
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:24,160
Because I really don't understand it at all.

358
00:52:24,970 --> 00:52:28,520
Occasionally, I'll look at some 
paintings and think they're nice,

359
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:31,470
but I have no professional knowledge in this area.

360
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:41,230
We were just thinking the same thing.

361
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:42,970
Really?

362
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:46,670
May I take your order?

363
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:50,520
Oh right, I'll have the same as well.

364
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:10,440
Good morning.

365
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:12,430
Hello.

366
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,850
Sorry, I'll be back again.

367
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:42,860
That's fine.

368
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:01,430
This is delicious.

369
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:03,040
Right?

370
00:54:03,610 --> 00:54:05,760
This is super delicious.

371
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:16,980
Oh, by the way, 
Takano came to our shop earlier.

372
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:20,710
Is Takano also interested in books?

373
00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:27,090
It seems like he wasn't looking for books.

374
00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:31,090
Do you talk to him when he's at the shop?

375
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:38,530
We both have work to do, 
and we don't see each other during breaks.

376
00:54:44,290 --> 00:54:48,590
Oh, right, the date.

377
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:49,710
A date?

378
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:52,450
Yeah, didn't Mr. Satoru mention it before?

379
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:59,970
I see, he's obedient, isn't he?

380
00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:04,150
Doesn't he look obedient?

381
00:55:28,570 --> 00:55:29,160
Good morning.

382
00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:30,860
Hello.

383
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:38,990
Sorry.

384
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:56,990
Um...

385
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:58,610
Excuse me.

386
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:01,270


387
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,110
Oh, by the way...

388
00:56:15,370 --> 00:56:18,830
Do you often come here, Aihara?

389
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:20,150
Huh?

390
00:56:21,770 --> 00:56:24,180
Aihara, the one you mentioned earlier, Tomoko?

391
00:56:25,170 --> 00:56:25,760
Yes.

392
00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:30,790
Well, she comes here often, 
for various reasons.

393
00:56:34,830 --> 00:56:39,560
What do you talk to her about?

394
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:41,080
Huh?

395
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:52,340
Does she have a boyfriend?

396
00:56:55,030 --> 00:56:57,170
I don't know, she never mentioned it.

397
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:05,770
Can you ask her casually next time?

398
00:57:06,330 --> 00:57:09,340
Huh, why don't you ask her yourself?

399
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:12,400
If you could help me with this, and besides

400
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:20,980
I've never initiated 
a conversation with a girl before.

401
00:57:27,770 --> 00:57:31,830
If you can help me with this

402
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:37,650
I'll treat you to coffee at the shop every time.

403
00:57:38,050 --> 00:57:40,470
Really?

404
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:44,450
Then I'll go every day.

405
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:47,670
Going every day might be a bit...

406
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:50,520
Deal's done.

407
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:55,020
No, still...

408
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:57,150
What should I do?

409
00:58:02,430 --> 00:58:03,520
Thank you for your help.

410
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:10,300
But please never tell her about it

411
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:13,170
I see

412
00:58:14,510 --> 00:58:15,810
Thank you for your help.

413
00:59:08,410 --> 00:59:09,680
Hello.

414
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:15,460
Nothing.

415
00:59:16,310 --> 00:59:17,150
Nothing at all.

416
00:59:25,550 --> 00:59:28,980
This is the book you ordered.

417
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:30,580
Thank you so much.

418
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:35,820
Can I have three bookmarks, please?

419
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:37,740
Bookmarks?

420
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:42,250
Wait, over there, in the second drawer.

421
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:46,700
Found them.

422
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,000
Here are three, choose.

423
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,690
This one, this one, and this one.

424
00:59:56,750 --> 00:59:58,020
Thank you for visiting.

425
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:43,510
Bidding in progress, 
coming right back, shopkeeper.

426
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:07,780
Excuse me.

427
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:39,660
Is it heavy? 
Are you okay?

428
01:01:51,930 --> 01:01:52,700
uncle..

429
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:57,020
What's with the books placed here?

430
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:59,390
Um, those are books we received

431
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:02,460
but couldn't set a price for yet,
so they're just there for now.

432
01:02:05,570 --> 01:02:06,860
It seems like an interesting book.

433
01:02:08,250 --> 01:02:08,880
that book?

434
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:09,670
Hmm.

435
01:02:11,690 --> 01:02:15,090
Really? I see.

436
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:24,550
Then you decide the price of this book.

437
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:25,620
Huh?

438
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:28,900
After you read it, set the price.

439
01:02:31,030 --> 01:02:32,930
But, is that allowed?

440
01:02:32,930 --> 01:02:33,480
It's allowed.

441
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:39,070
Then, excuse me. Let me through.

442
01:03:22,990 --> 01:03:24,840
Most shop owners will participate, right?

443
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:28,140
Yes, bookstores are all 
taking part enthusiastically.

444
01:03:30,530 --> 01:03:31,940
can't imagine it.

445
01:03:39,170 --> 01:03:42,400
It's truly incredible.

446
01:03:43,850 --> 01:03:44,630
What's that?

447
01:03:45,610 --> 01:03:51,820
I've only started reading old books recently.

448
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:56,170
I used to have no interest in them, 
but now I can't stop.

449
01:03:58,660 --> 01:04:02,420
What's wrong with that? 
Any place can be the starting point of one's life.

450
01:04:17,180 --> 01:04:18,070
That's true.

451
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:31,940
The Kanda Used Book Fair.

452
01:04:44,270 --> 01:04:45,060
Here it is!

453
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:48,890
Hello, Mr. Satoru.

454
01:04:48,890 --> 01:04:49,890
Hello.

455
01:04:49,890 --> 01:04:51,380
It was tough to find you.

456
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:53,290
Hello.

457
01:04:53,290 --> 01:04:53,980
This is my wife.

458
01:04:54,740 --> 01:04:55,730
Oh, it's Madam.

459
01:04:57,110 --> 01:04:57,940
This is Takako.

460
01:04:58,430 --> 01:05:00,640
- Nice to meet you. 
- Nice to meet you.

461
01:05:02,530 --> 01:05:03,260
Sales are going well, aren't they?

462
01:05:03,790 --> 01:05:07,010
Mr. Sabu you've gone crazy buying books again.

463
01:05:08,150 --> 01:05:12,520
Yes, if I keep buying like this, 
my house will be filled with books.

464
01:05:14,650 --> 01:05:17,400
If you don't mind, can we collect 
all the books from our house?

465
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:22,020
Leave me alone. It's terrifying. 
Don't you often lose something?

466
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:52,980
Your way of walking is strange.

467
01:05:53,630 --> 01:05:55,900
Sorry, I forgot how to walk.

468
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:58,640
There are many books over there too. Let's go.

469
01:05:59,830 --> 01:06:00,550
What did you say?

470
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:19,440
Participating in the used book fair makes 
you feel like Jimbocho is just like a book.

471
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:21,670
Like a book?

472
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:34,710
On the surface, it seems calm, but when 
you open a book, you find a noisy world inside.

473
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:40,940
After finishing reading and closing the book,
 it returns to tranquility.

474
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:49,070
I, I like this street.

475
01:06:51,700 --> 01:06:52,820
You do?

476
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:56,910
Yes.

477
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:06,980
Takako, feel free to come whenever you want.

478
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:26,670
Why are you so kind to me?

479
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:33,850
Didn't I tell you before? 
We haven't met many times,

480
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:46,750
Because I like Takako

481
01:07:50,410 --> 01:07:59,850
and to you, I might just be an unfamiliar uncle.

482
01:08:04,350 --> 01:08:05,310
it's different.

483
01:08:08,820 --> 01:08:10,550
You are my angel.

484
01:08:12,210 --> 01:08:13,050
Angel?

485
01:08:13,550 --> 01:08:15,050
Yes,

486
01:08:17,130 --> 01:08:20,730
You are the book god.

487
01:08:22,230 --> 01:08:26,780
Book god? Have I done something?

488
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:32,500
When you were born...

489
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:44,180
Didn't I tell you about the trip before?

490
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:50,240
I traveled to many countries,

491
01:08:54,090 --> 01:09:01,220
and it was because of you.

492
01:09:02,970 --> 01:09:03,840
How could that be?

493
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:14,160
After graduating from university, 
I worked at a publishing house,

494
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:16,590
But it didn't go well.

495
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:20,590
I quit after the third year.

496
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:25,480
The things I wanted to do 
didn't seem to work in society.

497
01:09:27,870 --> 01:09:34,920
I wasn't suitable for commercial books.

498
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:39,080
I couldn't handle it.

499
01:09:40,570 --> 01:09:53,460
After resigning, I couldn't find anything to do, 
and it felt like everything was collapsing.

500
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:56,430
Are you okay?

501
01:10:01,590 --> 01:10:07,510
I was also confused. I wondered if 
I didn't have a place in this world.

502
01:10:11,130 --> 01:10:13,790
Just live in depression.

503
01:10:16,010 --> 01:10:29,970
like being trapped in a cocoon.

504
01:10:34,910 --> 01:10:39,430
At that time, Meihui gave birth to you

505
01:10:41,900 --> 01:10:43,700
When I saw you for the first time,

506
01:10:44,510 --> 01:10:48,420
I almost cried for some reason.

507
01:10:55,360 --> 01:11:05,890
Seeing your tiny body wrapped in 
a blanket, sleeping so soundly,

508
01:11:07,620 --> 01:11:13,830
I felt like I should try harder.

509
01:11:19,190 --> 01:11:21,970
Although I'm not confident now,

510
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:27,370
I believe that one day 
I'll find a place where I truly belong.

511
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:30,830
I want to work towards that goal.

512
01:11:34,570 --> 01:11:39,150
Starting to travel, starting to read books, 
all of these have influenced me.

513
01:11:42,330 --> 01:11:44,890
So, have you found your place?

514
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:51,010
I have found it now? 
Although it took a long time to find it.

515
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:56,130
Is it here?

516
01:11:57,950 --> 01:11:58,610
right here

517
01:12:01,950 --> 01:12:11,020
After setting off into the world, 
I ended up back where I grew up.

518
01:12:11,710 --> 01:12:13,350
It's funny, isn't it?

519
01:12:13,550 --> 01:12:15,580
But at that moment, I finally understood

520
01:12:16,180 --> 01:12:21,730
Place is not a problem, 
What mattered most was my state of mind.

521
01:12:51,150 --> 01:12:51,890
Good night.

522
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:53,510
Good night.

523
01:13:00,850 --> 01:13:03,750
Seriously, you can come here anytime.

524
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:09,940
Thank you.

525
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:55,510
Boss,

526
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:56,700
I wonder why

527
01:13:58,220 --> 01:14:03,360
people continue living while 
searching for what they have lost.

528
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:09,440
While reading, I recalled past events.

529
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:11,680
Like about Takako.

530
01:14:12,940 --> 01:14:13,570
Yeah.

531
01:14:16,010 --> 01:14:20,630
The things about Momoko 
and when the store just opened.

532
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:22,840
It's so nostalgic.

533
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:41,800
If I had tried to keep Momoko, 
would she have stayed?

534
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:50,490
Only the heavens know.

535
01:14:55,100 --> 01:14:56,050
Yeah.

536
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:17,700
Where are you going?

537
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,110
I'm going to Hama-daima.

538
01:15:25,150 --> 01:15:26,830
Hama-daima... Where is that?

539
01:15:50,180 --> 01:15:54,020
-We're done. Thanks for your hard work. 
-Okay, thank you.

540
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:49,900
Good morning Takako.

541
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:56,640
It's getting colder and colder, isn't it? But if it keeps getting colder, it will eventually become warm.

542
01:16:57,460 --> 01:16:59,590
I feel like I didn't get enough sleep.

543
01:16:59,590 --> 01:17:01,940
Really? Well, that means you 
must be leading a leisurely life.

544
01:18:29,990 --> 01:18:30,760
What happened?
Did something happen?

545
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:33,560
Hmm?

546
01:18:35,850 --> 01:18:36,970
I have this feeling that you...

547
01:18:42,700 --> 01:18:47,800
Encountered someone unpleasant, is that it?

548
01:19:00,250 --> 01:19:01,220
Takako

549
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:09,190
Before you came here, 
what happened exactly?

550
01:19:13,870 --> 01:19:16,150
Uncle, how much do you know?

551
01:19:17,240 --> 01:19:20,080
I know nothing, 
except that you resigned from your job.

552
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:36,890
It's better to talk about 
your feelings if you're in pain.

553
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:18,560
What happened?

554
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:31,300
Want to sit? Sit?

555
01:20:33,340 --> 01:20:48,960
Come on, have a seat. What's wrong? 
Be a good boy. What's wrong?

556
01:21:25,090 --> 01:21:39,830
A senior colleague from 
the same company told me he's getting married.

557
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:44,360
Not with me.

558
01:21:49,790 --> 01:21:56,560
No, I've been dating him for a year and a half.

559
01:22:03,540 --> 01:22:17,230
So that's how it is.

560
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:28,170
Yes

561
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:31,610
So

562
01:22:40,460 --> 01:22:41,970
I slept for a long time.

563
01:22:46,700 --> 01:22:48,260
Slept for a long time

564
01:22:51,680 --> 01:23:01,470
I woke up thinking, 
"Can I pretend it didn't happen?"

565
01:23:03,630 --> 01:23:05,380
But I can't.

566
01:23:23,570 --> 01:23:30,370
Okay,

567
01:23:31,100 --> 01:23:38,510
be a good girl and ask that guy to apologize.

568
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:40,220
Really?

569
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:41,840
Really?

570
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:48,900
Ask him to apologize in person. 
Say sorry for hurting you.

571
01:23:49,150 --> 01:23:50,540
No need.

572
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,530
It's just that I'm so foolish

573
01:23:59,740 --> 01:24:05,830
that I wanted someone to talk to.

574
01:24:09,750 --> 01:24:12,630
Takako, aren't you unwilling to accept this?"

575
01:24:20,420 --> 01:24:31,440
Of course, I'm really unwilling. But...

576
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:49,590
Unless you don't talk to him honestly, 
you'll be burden by the past forever.

577
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:03,170
Come on, let's go.

578
01:25:08,310 --> 01:25:09,320
Okay, I got it.

579
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:53,950
What...

580
01:25:55,700 --> 01:25:59,540
I'm Takako's uncle, Morisaki Satoru.

581
01:26:02,700 --> 01:26:03,460
Hmm.

582
01:26:13,300 --> 01:26:16,040
what's the matter?

583
01:26:16,680 --> 01:26:19,570
Are we looking like newspaper peddlers to you?

584
01:26:20,350 --> 01:26:21,160
what?

585
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:27,660
We came here because 
you did something really unforgivable to her.

586
01:26:28,610 --> 01:26:31,860
Can't you feel anything at all?

587
01:26:33,350 --> 01:26:33,910
what?

588
01:26:36,010 --> 01:26:40,900
She's been so upset that she even quit her job.

589
01:26:40,900 --> 01:26:44,510
She's been depressed ever since. 
Don't you have any emotions?

590
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:47,320
You hurt her deeply. 
Are you heartless?

591
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:56,950
Wait, wait. 
Did she say I hurt her?

592
01:26:56,950 --> 01:26:57,610
Yes, that's right.

593
01:27:01,890 --> 01:27:04,470
I don't know where you came from, uncle.

594
01:27:07,210 --> 01:27:12,110
Why do you believe what this woman says?

595
01:27:15,640 --> 01:27:18,990
What benefit does she gain from lying?

596
01:27:20,380 --> 01:27:24,760
Because of you, she quit her job 
and is now in great pain.

597
01:27:24,760 --> 01:27:26,770
She quit on her own accord.

598
01:27:31,730 --> 01:27:37,190
Takako this guy is out of line.

599
01:27:37,690 --> 01:27:40,210
Why should I listen to you say such things?

600
01:27:46,060 --> 01:27:47,170
What's going on?

601
01:27:51,020 --> 01:27:52,200
What happened?

602
01:27:54,920 --> 01:27:56,810
Suddenly, he came here to insult me.

603
01:28:00,870 --> 01:28:05,580
I'm saying, 
what are you trying to do?

604
01:28:14,630 --> 01:28:16,550
Speak up,

605
01:28:27,020 --> 01:28:27,880
Takako.

606
01:28:38,110 --> 01:28:42,020
I don't know what you're thinking.

607
01:28:45,300 --> 01:28:47,580
I used to like you.

608
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:14,440
I'm not an object, 
I'm a person, I also have feelings.

609
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:29,710
I also think, and when things happen...

610
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:51,880
I used to be in great pain.

611
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:10,060
I told you, she has poured her heart out. 
You should respond as well.

612
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:29,520
If you don't want me to call the police, go back.

613
01:30:48,810 --> 01:30:49,550
Let's go back.

614
01:30:51,180 --> 01:30:51,780
Okay, fine.

615
01:31:39,970 --> 01:31:40,910
Sorry.

616
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:49,850
It's okay.

617
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:09,560
That was the first time 
I honestly expressed my feelings.

618
01:32:18,150 --> 01:32:21,370
It feels like a weight has been lifted.

619
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:47,400
uncle

620
01:35:47,610 --> 01:35:54,100
Have you made a decision?

621
01:35:55,300 --> 01:35:55,870
Yes.

622
01:35:57,560 --> 01:36:00,980
Then, put it on the third shelf over there.

623
01:36:33,430 --> 01:36:33,920
Huh?

624
01:36:34,290 --> 01:36:37,310
It's okay. I just felt relieved, that's all.

625
01:36:49,470 --> 01:36:49,950
Hmm.

626
01:37:55,150 --> 01:37:55,830
What's wrong?

627
01:37:57,390 --> 01:37:58,410
It's nothing.

628
01:38:14,040 --> 01:38:14,800
uncle.

629
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:15,440
Hmm?

630
01:38:17,770 --> 01:38:19,500
I'm leaving this place.

631
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:23,700
Why?

632
01:38:24,570 --> 01:38:27,000
To find a job and leave this place.

633
01:38:32,930 --> 01:38:33,990
Leave this place?

634
01:38:35,450 --> 01:38:36,000
Yes.

635
01:38:38,830 --> 01:38:39,930
Really?

636
01:38:41,650 --> 01:38:43,090
It's a big decision.

637
01:39:00,700 --> 01:39:01,930
It seems so sudden.

638
01:39:05,470 --> 01:39:09,580
It's not sudden. 
I've been considering it for a while now.

639
01:39:11,470 --> 01:39:13,210
I finally made up my mind.

640
01:39:17,810 --> 01:39:19,000
I see.

641
01:39:23,700 --> 01:39:24,850
That's how it is.

642
01:39:32,200 --> 01:39:36,250
But I will stay a little longer 
until I can stand on my own.

643
01:39:36,250 --> 01:39:38,660
Really? Then you have to work hard.

644
01:39:39,340 --> 01:39:40,860
I know. I'll do my best.

645
01:39:40,860 --> 01:39:43,150
Alright, I understand.

646
01:39:43,150 --> 01:39:43,850
Yes.

647
01:41:42,310 --> 01:41:43,800
Thank you for visiting.

648
01:42:39,420 --> 01:42:41,310
I'll feel very lonely.

649
01:42:45,500 --> 01:42:49,800
It's not easy to find a job. 
I'll still be here for a while.

650
01:42:51,510 --> 01:42:53,170
No need to move either.

651
01:42:54,740 --> 01:43:01,830
But it's easy to become spoiled here. 
I should learn to be independent.

652
01:43:05,630 --> 01:43:10,140
But I really like this street. 
It's a pity to leave.

653
01:43:17,110 --> 01:43:20,200
I like this street too.

654
01:43:21,500 --> 01:43:22,470
What do you like about it?

655
01:43:25,610 --> 01:43:33,730
Every time I come here, I think 
I used to be someone who could create value.

656
01:43:37,640 --> 01:43:39,400
The owner of a bookstore once said that

657
01:43:40,110 --> 01:43:45,500
instead of relying on buying 
valuable things to gain value,

658
01:43:46,890 --> 01:43:49,600
one should create value on their own. 
That's what makes a person strong.

659
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:56,410
I want to become that kind of person.

660
01:44:00,470 --> 01:44:03,520
Someone who creates value on their own.

661
01:44:06,760 --> 01:44:10,860
Yes, but the future is uncertain.

662
01:44:17,300 --> 01:44:18,460
Still, it's not bad.

663
01:44:27,750 --> 01:44:28,650
The weather is really nice.

664
01:44:31,530 --> 01:44:32,650
Yes, it is.

665
01:44:35,160 --> 01:44:36,530
Do you want to go to the café?

666
01:44:36,820 --> 01:44:38,070
Again?

667
01:44:38,540 --> 01:44:40,590
Their drinks are delicious.

668
01:44:40,590 --> 01:44:41,490
Then, you treat me.

669
01:44:43,020 --> 01:44:45,300
Sure, why not? It's nice.

670
01:44:47,760 --> 01:44:48,960
Wait a moment.

671
01:44:50,680 --> 01:44:58,290
Movie Title: " Days of Morisaki Bookstore"
