00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,566
<i>In Yor's World
He's the man<i>

3
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,251
<i>Yor's World<i>

4
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,214
<i>Lost in the world of past<i>

5
00:00:57,515 --> 00:01:00,190
<i>In the echo of ancient blast<i>

6
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,210
<i>Yor's World<i>

7
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:06,296
<i>There is a man from the future
A man of mystery <i>

8
00:01:06,897 --> 00:01:09,553
<i>Yor's World<i>

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,210
<i>No tribes to lead the way<i>

10
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,257
<i>In his search for the yesterday<i>

11
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,760
<i>Yor's World<i>

12
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:22,539
<i>Misty illusions hiding
His famous destiny<i>

13
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,382
<i>Yor's World.<i>

14
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,485
<i>Yor, the touch of fire<i>

15
00:01:29,486 --> 00:01:32,500
<i>Yor the proud and free desire<i>

16
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:37,280
<i>He never sees the sun
He's always on the run<i>

17
00:01:37,381 --> 00:01:40,741
<i>Him and his days are gone<i>

18
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,681
<i>They say he will go on<i>

19
00:01:45,082 --> 00:01:48,554
<i>His search goes on and on<i>

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,285
<i>Yor's World
He's forsaken the name<i>

21
00:01:53,586 --> 00:01:57,208
<i>Yor's World
And the world looks like fire<i>

22
00:01:57,808 --> 00:02:02,250
<i>He's gonna make all the wild
Things look tame tonight<i>

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,180
<i>In his fight<i>

24
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:14,550
<i>In Yor's World
He's the man<i>

25
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:33,285
<i>Yor's World
He's forsaken the name<i>

26
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:37,208
<i>Yor's World
And the world looks like fire<i>

27
00:02:37,786 --> 00:02:41,208
<i>Yor's World
On the sun there's a soul<i>

28
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:46,385
<i>Yor's World
And the world looks like fire<i>

29
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,143
And finally we must give thanks
for we have reached this prosperous valley.

30
00:02:54,544 --> 00:03:01,535
By raising our childrens to
the heavens in homage to the gods.

31
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,262
Now for that matter,
may this day be celebrated...

32
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:20,758
with celebration and joy.

33
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,964
Look!

34
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,813
Leave with me!

35
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,690
Look out, stranger!

36
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,847
Drink, drink it.

37
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,180
It burns like fire!

38
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,596
The blood of your enemies
makes you stronger.

39
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,150
- Drink!
- I rather stay weak.

40
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:34,150
Who are you?
Where you came from?

41
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:37,554
I'm Yor, the Hunter.
I'm came from the high mountains.

42
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,300
Thank you for saving Ka-Laa.

43
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,380
She is the most precious thing
of my life.

44
00:06:41,582 --> 00:06:44,548
My name is Pag.
Her father was my king.

45
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,827
Let's take the meat of the beast.

46
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,380
What a strange piece of metal.

47
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,832
What is it?

48
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,613
I don't know, I have this
since I can remember.

49
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:02,729
- I've never seen anything like it.
- I have seen a similar medallion!

50
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,982
- Are they your people?
- Yes.

51
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,730
- Where?
- Beyond the mountains.

52
00:07:10,031 --> 00:07:13,265
It was worn by a woman
who lives among the desert people.

53
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:19,878
I have seen gleaming on her chest
when the sun rays strike it.

54
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,332
- Who is she?
- She is the daughter of the Gods.

55
00:07:24,363 --> 00:07:27,848
They say she descended into the earth
in a tongue of fire.

56
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,152
And now she is worshipped
as a queen.

57
00:07:30,753 --> 00:07:33,834
Come, Yor.
Welcome to our village.

58
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,890
Good!

59
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,948
Take some, you did well, Ka-Laa.

60
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,130
Yor, you're so different
from the other men I've seen.

61
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,980
Kill them!

62
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,300
The women!

63
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,890
Take him!

64
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,690
I want him alive!

65
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,800
- Yor!
- No!

66
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,690
Ka-Laa, come on!

67
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,980
After them!

68
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,270
We must find out any of your people
who's still alive and bring them with us.

69
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,780
Do you know the big tree
in middle of the river? - Yes.

70
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:55,799
There's a cave underneath.
We'll met you there, Pag.

71
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,150
Ka-Laa, go with Yor.
He will protect you.

72
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:03,326
No! Don't go, Pag!
It's not safe to go back alone!

73
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,150
This man seems very loyal to you.

74
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:39,483
Yes. Since my father died,
he never left me.

75
00:12:39,984 --> 00:12:43,517
Come on. I know a place where
we can rest the night.

76
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,150
- Pag... Where is Ka-Laa?
- Ka-Laa is safe.

77
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:20,198
She's with Yor. But they took
all the women as prisoners.

78
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:26,150
They were beasts, they butchered all of us.
And the children too and the elders...

79
00:13:26,176 --> 00:13:31,212
Save yourself, and Ka-Laa...
Go with Yor.

80
00:13:31,213 --> 00:13:35,403
Your fate lies with him.
He...

81
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,356
We'll be safe here, Ka-Laa.

82
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,600
It's where I used to hide
when I was a boy.

83
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,600
I'll not sleep,
I'll stand guard.

84
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,550
What a strange thing.
What is it?

85
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,200
I wish i knew.

86
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:29,600
It's like fire burning inside me,
a question without an answer.

87
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,300
Remind the sun of fire.
No mother, no father.

88
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,300
Oh, Yor, you'll find the answer.

89
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,630
There must be a tribe of men
like you.

90
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,600
And there must be women, too.

91
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,980
Get out of here, Ka-Laa.

92
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,690
Get out of here, I've said!

93
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,200
His power is now mine!

94
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:18,150
Oh, Gods of rock and water,
high, the great Ucan!

95
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:20,260
No!

96
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,360
Take her back to the cave!

97
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,600
Yor!

98
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,690
Throw him off the cliff.

99
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,140
Hurry!

100
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:40,520
The gods must be a thirst
for fresh blood. Hurry!

101
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,376
Thank God you're alive!

102
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,160
C'mon, it's not safe to remain here.

103
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,158
No! First we must find Ka-Laa!

104
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,150
- Where is she?
- We lost her in battle.

105
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:49,570
Ka-Laa now belongs to him.
That's it.

106
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,350
No, Pag!
I don't recognize your loss!

107
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,125
That way!

108
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,222
You, you and you!

109
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,733
Now we'll fight and our prize
will be this woman here!

110
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,716
We can do nothing now.
There are several of them down there.

111
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,943
The beast of the night.
Stay low.

112
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,763
You're mine.

113
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,755
You know the great Ucan?

114
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,897
Yor!

115
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,847
<i>After them! Hurry!<i>

116
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,791
Thank you, Yor. You given me back
to me that which I love most in the world.

117
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,735
Thank you, Pag.
You did your best.

118
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,807
Now let's get going.

119
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,441
Pag, why is Yor so different
from the other men?

120
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:06,284
I don't know Ka-Laa.
I'm curious too about Yor's life.

121
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,407
Where's that steam come from?

122
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,574
From the depths of the earth.

123
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,750
The bottom of these must be
a great heat which causes these vapours.

124
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,493
- And the smoke?
- I don't know.

125
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,252
This is the land of diseased.
Of the men of the desert.

126
00:28:40,253 --> 00:28:42,232
They worship the god of fire.

127
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,974
I've heard they practice magic
rituals with supernatural powers.

128
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,803
I'm afraid death rules
this land.

129
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,200
Listen, I'll be back before
day break.

130
00:28:52,621 --> 00:28:56,125
Yor, please!
Don't go to that woman.

131
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,409
I'm afraid only evil happen there.

132
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,979
You both stay here.

133
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,150
Don't worry, Ka-Laa.
And don't try to follow me.

134
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:10,150
Last night I had a dream,
and I saw you helpless...

135
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:14,657
surrounded by fire.
Please don't go, Yor.

136
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,690
I'll be fine.

137
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,648
He will return?

138
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,500
Yes, Ka-Laa.
He'll return.

139
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,340
Where did you get that medallion?

140
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,370
- What is it mean?
- They say I came here togheter with those men.

141
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,786
There, cold in the ice.

142
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,921
Why am I alive and they are dead?
I don't know.

143
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,469
And why the ice is formed
in this part deserted...

144
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:33,847
is a mystery without an answer.
But...

145
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,146
The little water that comes from me
is vital to these people.

146
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:41,180
And they worship me
as a divine goddess.

147
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:44,745
Now you're a living proof
that we represent a race.

148
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,548
Together we will find
an answer.

149
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,150
Why did you come to this land of death?

150
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:37,200
I came looking for you.
I was told of your existence.

151
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,578
I don't know how I got here.
But they would never let me leave.

152
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,605
You see? These people are
threatened by land in which they live.

153
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,518
The poison of these vapors
in the ground which kill their plans.

154
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,177
They are convinced that sacrificing
every stranger they captured...

155
00:34:56,178 --> 00:34:59,557
is the only way to placate
the wrath of the gods.

156
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,172
- What's your name?
- Roa.

157
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,378
Listen, now we both know
there are others like us.

158
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,150
We got to escape. There must be
some place in this world...

159
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,600
where we can live in peace
with our people.

160
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,722
Now release me,
or kill me now.

161
00:35:37,006 --> 00:35:39,798
Wait, Ka-Laa!

162
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,192
If Yor came this way,
I feel for his life.

163
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:46,126
This is no place for man
or beast, we must turn back!

164
00:35:46,135 --> 00:35:47,827
No, Pag!

165
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,544
We promise we wouldn't follow him.

166
00:35:51,745 --> 00:35:53,692
I want to go to Yor!

167
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,870
Look out!

168
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,712
Stop! Stop! Stop!

169
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,924
Roa!

170
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,440
Try walking.
Let's go!

171
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,394
Yor!

172
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,705
Here!

173
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,200
Yor!

174
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,690
Who are you?

175
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,890
We will need a lot of more hemp
before you throw.

176
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,600
I have to thank you and Ka-Laa,
but there's no need you accompany me.

177
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,600
If you wish to settle here,
Roa and I will continue alone.

178
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,200
Ka-Laa is uninterested to my care.

179
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:00,130
She will not leave your side.

180
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:01,890
You're a good man, Pag.

181
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,990
And that's no lie.

182
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,600
My life's taking now a new meaning
with you and your friends.

183
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,590
Ka-Laa!
Come help us!

184
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,790
Yor!

185
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,890
A little different from the desert?

186
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,821
I loved this place.

187
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,250
I could stay here forever, Yor.

188
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:31,489
Do you know that I've never
belonged to another man?

189
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:36,309
And that I've never felt the desire
and longing that I'm feeling now for you?

190
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,871
Beautiful, Roa.

191
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,124
I'll go look for them.
The meat is burning.

192
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:05,300
Your jealousy is burning.

193
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,600
A man of our people
can have many wives.

194
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,039
- So why can't Yor have two?
- You don't understand, Pag.

195
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:16,200
That woman is from
the same race of Yor.

196
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,168
And can take him away forever.

197
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:21,799
If that has to be,
you can not oppose their destiny.

198
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:58,752
Get up!

199
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,242
- Only one of us can belong to him.
- You can not understand.

200
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,725
I understand that one of us
must die.

201
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,180
- Where is Ka-Laa, Pag?
- She went looking for you.

202
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:37,300
<i>Yor!<i>

203
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,882
Yor, look out!

204
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,887
Roa!

205
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,864
Die!
Die, you bastard!

206
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,965
Damn Ucan!

207
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,837
Yor... you see?

208
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,739
Dreams are only dreams.

209
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,874
No, don't leave me.

210
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:21,300
Things seems coming back to me.
I see an island...

211
00:45:21,601 --> 00:45:23,971
In the middle of a big sea...

212
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,637
And on the island,
there is a magnificent castle.

213
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,257
That's where we came from.

214
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,698
Where our race lives.

215
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,460
Take my medallion
and give it to Ka-Laa.

216
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,275
It's the emblem of our world.

217
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,998
She loves you.

218
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:01,782
Kiss me, Yor, quickly.
My gods are calling me...

219
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,509
A part of me will always
remain here.

220
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,498
We always lose something,
but life goes on.

221
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,925
The country you seek
might be far away.

222
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:15,746
- Have you ever seen the sea before, Ka-Laa?
- No, it's so big!

223
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,831
Ka-Laa, the water is salty,
Don't drink it!

224
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,832
Smells good.

225
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,715
- Where is Ka-Laa?
- Fishing.

226
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,160
Eat, you must be hungry.

227
00:48:24,171 --> 00:48:26,813
I'm sure I will, I'm hungry.

228
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,897
What was that?

229
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,333
Come on, it came from over there!

230
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:42,636
Ka-Laa, stay there!

231
00:48:42,660 --> 00:49:26,660
...:::Lord Sadler:::...
lordsadler2012@gmail.com

232
00:50:15,009 --> 00:50:16,854
Thanks, Pag.

233
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,137
We must go back to the sea,
quickly.

234
00:50:20,262 --> 00:50:22,480
May could it be another beast
out there, come.

235
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,889
Come with us.
Our village is near.

236
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,200
Why did Yor risked his life
like that?

237
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,200
He did the same thing
to save us, remember?

238
00:50:35,209 --> 00:50:38,430
A generous man does
what's heart commands.

239
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,760
It's not safe here, let's go!

240
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,742
There are my people.
And that is our village.

241
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,200
Why are the guards
watching the sky?

242
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:24,915
They're watching for the gods!

243
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,192
- He is your man?
- Yes.

244
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:37,549
Where are your children?
And his other wives?

245
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,958
You're getting heavy!

246
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,399
Tarita, what happened?

247
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:49,571
- This man saved our lives.
- I'm grateful, it was nothing.

248
00:51:49,836 --> 00:51:51,992
My name is Kay.

249
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,428
Tarita and the little ones
are my children.

250
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:59,250
According to our customs,
Tarita's life now belongs to you.

251
00:51:59,801 --> 00:52:01,502
She will be your mate.

252
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,769
Take me with you, stranger!

253
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,906
You're a sweet child, Tarita.
But I already have a woman.

254
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,765
- At least accept our hospitality.
- I'd like that, Kay.

255
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,795
What did your son mean when
he said you are looking for the gods?

256
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:27,711
Two moons passed since we killed
the man who drop from the heavens.

257
00:52:27,721 --> 00:52:32,360
- We now fear the revenge.
- If you killed them, it cannot be a God.

258
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:34,973
I promise you, it was a god.

259
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,320
He descended from the heavens
in a strange fire bird.

260
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:41,691
Fell over there.
We all ran to see.

261
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:44,522
One of my men overcame its fear
and approached the visitor.

262
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:49,317
In pieces, we couldn't strike him.
In fire.

263
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,768
So we threw our arrows at him
and there was a great explosion.

264
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,323
And he fell back in the flames.

265
00:52:54,924 --> 00:52:59,473
Now all that remains of that bird
on fire is this strange object.

266
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:05,919
There.

267
00:53:07,009 --> 00:53:09,777
It's made of a substance
unknow to us.

268
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,385
It was threw here in the explosion.

269
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,982
It might explode too.

270
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,897
That's why we leave it here.

271
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,896
Come, the women have prepared
a feast in your honor.

272
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,291
You know, Kay...

273
00:53:31,292 --> 00:53:34,401
I was thinking about that bird
of fire that fell from the heavens.

274
00:53:35,002 --> 00:53:37,732
It could be part of the answer
you're looking for.

275
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,978
The bird? The destruction?

276
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,170
I think the man wanted to kill
because he was much afraid of you...

277
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:46,356
as you were of him.
And you didn't understand each other.

278
00:53:46,657 --> 00:53:48,494
Yor, come with us.

279
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,734
Ka-Laa! You come too!

280
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,299
I must go too. I have to retreat my weapons
on the cave of that strange object.

281
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:16,751
You'll have time enough.
Now enjoy your food.

282
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,923
- The village!
- Oh, my God!

283
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,890
Father! No!

284
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,690
Dad! Dad!

285
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:42,670
No, let me go!
No! Father!

286
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,527
<i>- Eagle to M1.</i>
- The box speaks!

287
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,849
<i>Eagle to M1.
Mission completed.</i>

288
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,890
<i>- Eagle to M1.</i>
- This is what they heard.

289
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,120
<i>Eagle to M1.
Mission completed.</i>

290
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:19,978
Damn talking box!

291
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,786
They're not gods.
Gods couldn't be this cruel.

292
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,883
I'll find them!

293
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,890
And I'll revenge Kay and his people.

294
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,477
I must leave, Tarita.

295
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,150
Stay, Yor.
We need a new leader.

296
00:57:04,194 --> 00:57:07,255
No. My destiny cares me elsewhere.

297
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:12,703
Just as yours is to remain here
and make a new life with your people.

298
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,377
Your father wanted that, Tarita.

299
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:19,179
Our fishermen used to talk
of a mysterious island...

300
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,390
always surrounded by
violent storms.

301
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,650
If you feel that can be
the one you seek...

302
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:26,621
you can have my father's boat
to take you there.

303
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,917
Thank you.

304
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,999
It's truly beautiful!

305
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,200
This island that your
fishermen saw, Tarita...

306
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:49,850
- In which direction they said that was?
- In the direction of the setting sun.

307
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,600
I'll never forget you!
Thank you!

308
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,600
Thank you for everything, Tarita!

309
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,874
Yor, the wind is freshening!

310
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,997
- Look!
- Check the sail, Pag!

311
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,734
It's stuck!

312
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,220
Pag, rush up the sail!

313
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:22,715
I keep trying, but I can't!

314
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,561
He'll drown!

315
00:59:38,070 --> 00:59:40,735
Hold tight!

316
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,953
Ka-Laa!

317
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,887
Ka-Laa! Ka-Laa!

318
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,737
He has reached the outer limits
of my territory.

319
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,613
A decision must be made.

320
01:00:47,007 --> 01:00:51,733
You! You'll bring it here!

321
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,673
This rebel must be analyzed.

322
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:40,600
<i>Search Unit six to patrol.
Six to patrol. Leader.<i>

323
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:45,600
<i>Search unit, six or nine.<i>

324
01:01:54,600 --> 01:02:00,253
<i>Overlord, two more
intruders in the sector 1-6.<i>

325
01:02:00,254 --> 01:02:02,858
<i>We await your orders.<i>

326
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,426
I want them both captured
and brought here!

327
01:02:28,941 --> 01:02:30,944
Alive!

328
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,967
There's no need to be afraid,
I'm a friend. Come on!

329
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,868
They are the androids of Overlord.

330
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,957
Come on!

331
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,150
Don't be afraid.
I'm your friend.

332
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:38,453
And this is the land you left
when you were a child.

333
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:42,659
- My name is Ena.
- If you're my friend as you said, release me!

334
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,191
I must obey orders,
but I'll free you hands.

335
01:04:48,562 --> 01:04:50,763
Only Overlord can free you.

336
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,817
We've learned a lot about you,
from your medallion.

337
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,621
Your record is fully
registered on it.

338
01:05:03,622 --> 01:05:07,607
Your name is Gallahah, and you're
the son of the rebel, Asgard.

339
01:05:08,008 --> 01:05:10,327
Your ship was destroyed
when you left many years ago.

340
01:05:10,330 --> 01:05:13,553
Your father was vanished
and he took you with him.

341
01:05:13,890 --> 01:05:17,200
How you survive the explosion and grow up
in the outside world is a mystery.

342
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:21,705
What you mean you know all about me?
How do you know who my parents were?

343
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:27,965
I will allow this poor fool
to learn the secrets of his existence.

344
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,495
That is the far of my
generosity will go.

345
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,446
No, I don't want him killed!
Not yet.

346
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,541
He's perfect for
what I have in mind.

347
01:05:46,542 --> 01:05:49,737
A great blow for the genetic engineer!

348
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,755
And last...

349
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,894
a chance to prove my greatness.

350
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,800
<i>Daddy! Daddy!<i>

351
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,791
Those are your parents.

352
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,824
And the child is you.

353
01:06:08,025 --> 01:06:11,717
My Father, my Mother...

354
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,450
How beautiful she is.

355
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:18,800
I remember that. That's when
I was learning to hunt.

356
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,600
Sometimes I have to thrown back.

357
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,890
And you do know all about me,
don't you?

358
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,300
The machine speaks the truth?

359
01:06:30,451 --> 01:06:35,989
Oh, yes. And even has a record
of your new friends, Pag and Ka-Laa.

360
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,180
Free me, Ena,
so I'll go look for them.

361
01:06:44,180 --> 01:06:47,724
- I already told you...
- Free him, Ena!

362
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:58,911
Who are you?

363
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,559
I am the Overlord.

364
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:11,504
Ruler of my people.
And yours too.

365
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:14,581
- You are completely in my power.
- What have you done to my friends?

366
01:07:16,002 --> 01:07:17,897
Ah, your friends?

367
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,871
Yes, we have separated
during the storm.

368
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,180
As you can see, they still alive.

369
01:07:34,189 --> 01:07:38,150
Unfortunately, they disappear
just after they came the shore.

370
01:07:38,154 --> 01:07:39,917
But you'll find them.

371
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,703
And given the welcome
that they deserve.

372
01:07:52,004 --> 01:07:55,277
The girl's records will be
analyzed, then executed.

373
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:34,600
Don't be afraid, you're welcome
to no home. We are friends.

374
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,600
You are Pag and you are Ka-Laa.

375
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,300
The man you love
and who loves you is alive.

376
01:08:44,372 --> 01:08:47,150
- I just left him.
- Is it true?

377
01:08:47,551 --> 01:08:50,502
- Yes, you can trust me.
- Take me to him!

378
01:08:50,803 --> 01:08:54,531
That wouldn't be wise. The Overlord
released him only few minutes ago.

379
01:08:54,854 --> 01:08:57,511
He hopes to use him as bait
to capture you and Pag.

380
01:08:57,812 --> 01:09:00,319
He knows you've landed on the island,
but can't find you.

381
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:03,253
What did you call him?
The Overlord? Who is that?

382
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:07,977
We are all that is left of
a civilization that was wiped out...

383
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,803
by a great atomic blast.

384
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:15,179
Whenever man discovers something
greater than itself...

385
01:09:15,180 --> 01:09:17,467
he abuses it until them destroy.

386
01:09:17,697 --> 01:09:20,464
Overlord has leding us as longer
to the same path.

387
01:09:21,005 --> 01:09:23,224
He commands all of us.

388
01:09:23,438 --> 01:09:26,188
And his main intention
is unquestionably...

389
01:09:26,389 --> 01:09:28,205
to do evil.

390
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:33,255
Go check the access points.
The androids are searching everywhere.

391
01:09:35,010 --> 01:09:37,295
Your world is forbidden to us.

392
01:09:37,396 --> 01:09:41,050
According to the Overlord,
he still contaminated by nuclear fallout.

393
01:09:41,251 --> 01:09:45,937
And It's a barely wasteland
where life no longer exists.

394
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,600
But tell us,
what is it really like?

395
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,688
We are proof that life does exists.

396
01:09:51,890 --> 01:09:54,250
There are many dangers,
wild animals barbarously striking.

397
01:09:54,250 --> 01:09:56,600
But there are also people
who live in peace.

398
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,280
- Ena.
- Yes?

399
01:09:58,381 --> 01:10:02,255
- Has the girl gone.
- Yes.

400
01:10:02,351 --> 01:10:03,952
Damn!

401
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,539
Where is she?
What have you done to her?

402
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:14,501
Do not worry. We are planning
a revolt for years.

403
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,248
And now that Yor, the son
Asgard, has returned...

404
01:10:18,249 --> 01:10:22,271
- He will be our new leader.
- I don't understand what you're talking about.

405
01:10:22,372 --> 01:10:26,449
- I wanna go join Ka-Laa!
- Be patient, you'll see her soon.

406
01:10:26,650 --> 01:10:28,311
I'll attend to the robot memory banks.

407
01:10:28,712 --> 01:10:31,725
- Go now, Ena.
- Come on, Pag.

408
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,980
Ka-Laa!

409
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,360
Where are you?

410
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,980
Ka-Laa!

411
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,760
Where are you?

412
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,980
Ka-Laa!

413
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,960
Where are you?

414
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,980
Ka-Laa!

415
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,560
Ka-Laa, which one is you?

416
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,923
Which one are you?

417
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,926
It's you!

418
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,983
Don't be afraid.

419
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,963
Come look at this, Ka-Laa.

420
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,615
C'mon, I'll show you my past.

421
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:24,890
I hope I figure it out.

422
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,855
Welcome, Ka-Laa.

423
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,413
The rose of fertility.

424
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,392
She is my woman, Overlord.

425
01:14:33,393 --> 01:14:37,570
I am the only one who can own
anything on this island.

426
01:14:37,860 --> 01:14:39,289
Who are you, anyway?

427
01:14:39,290 --> 01:14:44,035
I am one of the survivors who
came here at the time of great destruction.

428
01:14:44,136 --> 01:14:49,274
But many of us carry the genes of the
radioactive fallout that destroyed our cities.

429
01:14:49,275 --> 01:14:53,713
At that time many of us died
until we neutralize the disease.

430
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:59,226
For generations, I have defending
my subjects against the great plague...

431
01:14:59,227 --> 01:15:02,472
that continues to rubbish
the outside world.

432
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:08,309
I want my people to procreate,
multiply and grow strong.

433
01:15:09,010 --> 01:15:12,276
That eventually,
I may conquer the world.

434
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:16,294
And exterminate all barbarians.

435
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:19,800
You believe you're a God,
but you think as a murderer.

436
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:26,426
You talk just like your father,
and those who plot against me.

437
01:15:27,006 --> 01:15:29,764
But now...

438
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:37,832
They will replace all humans.

439
01:15:38,361 --> 01:15:40,267
They're a part of my military power.

440
01:15:40,268 --> 01:15:44,377
I will create technicians,
scientists, magnificent minds!

441
01:15:44,378 --> 01:15:48,245
Who will all think
according to my will.

442
01:15:48,446 --> 01:15:51,733
You'll command a world of puppets,
is that your golden life?

443
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,923
Yes.

444
01:15:56,024 --> 01:15:58,580
I'm the giver of death.

445
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,304
But also of life.

446
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:06,220
You are to be the forefather
of a new race...

447
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:10,539
together with Ka-Laa, this
genetically perfect woman that is your mate.

448
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:16,238
As I said, I am experimenting
with a new type of android...

449
01:16:16,258 --> 01:16:20,290
which requires the seed of
a specially like yourself to produce...

450
01:16:20,291 --> 01:16:25,760
a new race! Superior to these
slower intelligence models.

451
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,310
You will be genetically
perfect too.

452
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:32,310
And you'll think as well
I want too, you'll see.

453
01:16:32,311 --> 01:16:34,234
I will operate on your mind!

454
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:37,690
Until every thought that's not
proper has been eliminated.

455
01:16:37,235 --> 01:16:43,820
And you will have a new mind and
its memory will shall transmitted to your genes.

456
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,908
And when you have inseminated
this woman...

457
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,944
You will die.

458
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,783
We have to act quickly.
Pick your weapon, c'mon!

459
01:17:13,010 --> 01:17:17,248
Soon you will be two new
individuals, calm and docile.

460
01:17:17,249 --> 01:17:20,576
Who knows I may even
let you live, Gallahah.

461
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:50,237
- Are you ready to fight?
- Yes!

462
01:17:50,238 --> 01:17:52,637
- Let's go, Yor!
- Right!

463
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,256
The rebels have been unmasked.

464
01:17:57,009 --> 01:18:00,768
We'll shall destroy every one of them.

465
01:18:02,030 --> 01:18:06,658
As we always have done
with all rebels in the past.

466
01:18:13,003 --> 01:18:16,815
They have dared to threaten
the authority of the Overlord!

467
01:18:17,016 --> 01:18:20,519
All androids make a hunt!

468
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:29,517
Go to your positions.

469
01:18:29,700 --> 01:18:32,644
We'll place this trick in the
command station of the atomic pile.

470
01:18:32,945 --> 01:18:35,360
- The others can begin boarding.
- Boarding to where?

471
01:18:35,361 --> 01:18:37,055
You will be taking our culture
with you to help you build...

472
01:18:37,060 --> 01:18:38,250
a new world.

473
01:18:38,256 --> 01:18:40,899
You talk like you're not
planning to come along.

474
01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:43,840
I don't know how many of us
will make it.

475
01:19:08,755 --> 01:19:10,385
Come on!

476
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,532
Damn!
Kill them! Kill them!

477
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:27,760
Block all access
to the atomic pile!

478
01:19:43,700 --> 01:19:47,542
These fools thought they can beat me,
the Overlord!

479
01:19:47,843 --> 01:19:50,907
- He acted before us.
- We can't just give up.

480
01:19:52,008 --> 01:19:55,796
- There must be some other way to cross.
- Yes, over there.

481
01:20:10,972 --> 01:20:12,897
Set it!

482
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,892
No, Yor!

483
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,725
It's too dangerous!

484
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,799
We have no choice, Ka-Laa.
We have to let him go.

485
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,231
I've set it for eight minutes.

486
01:20:24,332 --> 01:20:26,386
Someone shoot him!

487
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,943
Kill him! Kill him!

488
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:44,947
I'm surrounded by fools around me!

489
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,702
Damn!

490
01:20:49,932 --> 01:20:53,857
Save yourselves!
Go! Get moving!

491
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,993
Come on, Pag!

492
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:30,309
Pag, you did it!
Now we gonna hurry, c'mon!

493
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,736
They activated the atomic pile!

494
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,605
The bomb must be stopped!

495
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:42,421
<i>Overlord, there's no escape!<i>

496
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,781
Your reign of evil has ended.

497
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:49,421
You are quite powerless
without your army of robots.

498
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:53,026
<i>They are not programmed
to shut down the atomic pile.<i>

499
01:21:54,027 --> 01:21:57,167
<i>So you have launch to go reach
to the control concil to yourself.<i>

500
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:01,578
<i>While I deactivate your
electronic puppets, sector by sector.<i>

501
01:22:01,579 --> 01:22:03,892
<i>Level by level.<i>

502
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:16,722
- Pag! Shoot him! Shoot him!
- No, Pag! It's useless!

503
01:22:20,053 --> 01:22:22,260
You can't kill somebody who
is an illusion, a shadow.

504
01:22:22,261 --> 01:22:25,587
No, dammit!
He must push the button physically!

505
01:22:41,039 --> 01:22:43,575
Overlord!

506
01:22:48,034 --> 01:22:50,858
No, Ka-Laa!

507
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,823
Come on, the bomb will do the rest!

508
01:23:34,013 --> 01:23:36,881
I've done it, Ka-Laa!
Let's go!

509
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:44,300
<i>I'm beating your ambition
to create a master race.<i>

510
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:48,300
You have kept the world in darkness
in hidden progress.

511
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:52,300
It is the man, with all its
faults, that represents the future.

512
01:23:53,030 --> 01:23:55,300
Not your dream race
