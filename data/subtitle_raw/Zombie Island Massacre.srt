Hello?

Yes.

36
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,256
Oh, all right, thank you.

37
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:49,093
What was that?

38
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:52,225
The tour leaves in 10 minutes.

39
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,807
Can't we just pass on that?

40
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:56,642
You already paid
for the tickets.

41
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:59,652
Yes, but I also.

42
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,390
I'd like to pass
on that actually.

43
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,697
Paid for this.

44
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:04,862
What is it?

45
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,034
It's gorgeous.

46
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,821
Oh, Joe, I love you.

47
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:16,586
Now, what about
Saint Mary's, hmm?

48
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:18,751
San Marie.

49
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,959
San Marie, it's an
island, a crazy island,

50
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:23,510
more than most, that's all.

51
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:26,223
I hope you're right.

52
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:34,939
- Hi.
- Hello, how are you?

53
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,397
Fine, thank you.

54
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,920
How's your air conditioner now?

55
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,559
Works perfectly, thanks to you.

56
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:41,489
Hey, Paul.

00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,276
Met him on the
plane coming down.

58
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:45,576
Ah.

00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,068
This is Paul Morrison,
Ace photographer.

60
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,027
Please to meet you.

61
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,532
- How are you?
- Connie Moore.

62
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:51,976
- Fine, thank you.
- Famous artist.

63
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,786
No, no, just plain
painter, please.

64
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,127
Hi.

65
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,170
Well, if you don't mind,

66
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:58,013
I am going to go pick
up the rest of my stuff.

67
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,129
There's no hurry.

68
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:01,217
Save me a seat?

69
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:02,343
Promise.

70
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,636
That's the lady next door.

71
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,053
She looks good.

72
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,278
Matt.

73
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:23,781
Matt.

74
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:26,784
Matt!

75
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,077
- Ow.
- Get up.

76
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,492
What'd you do that for?

77
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,786
That silly tour
of yours is leaving.

78
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:32,782
Still wanna go?

79
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,083
Oh, great.

80
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,369
Come on, this'll
be a real picnic.

81
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:07,992
Hello?

82
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:13,286
Oh, oh, thank you,
we'll be right there.

83
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,285
Come on, lover, time to go.

84
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,167
This is some honeymoon.

85
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,620
Oh, come on, Eddie,
it'll be romantic.

86
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:22,374
Yeah.

87
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,456
Yes, of course.

88
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,124
Thank you very much.

89
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,303
George, George.

90
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,591
Time for the cruise.

91
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:35,936
Feel up to it?

92
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,062
Oh, sure.

93
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,271
You got your pills?

94
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:42,975
Ethel, don't worry about it.

95
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,812
10 island in five days,

96
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:49,068

'em yet, have I?

97
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,491
There's a good boy.

98
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:52,828
Just in time.

99
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:53,996
What is?

100
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:56,909
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

101
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,119
Jerry, what's just in time?

102
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:00,872
For us to get out of here

103
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,378
before you eat another
whole banana pie.

104
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:05,880
Now you listen to me

105
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:06,797
a second, Jerry,
come on, I'll give you

106
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,135
a hershey bar on the bus.

107
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:10,294
Oh, wait'll I get you home.

108
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,049
Well, well, well, here we are.

109
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,221
Everyone's been summoned.

110
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,678
This way, please.

111
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,353
Three, five, this way,

11.

115
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,031
All present and accounted for.

116
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,827

welcome you too.

120
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,544
Today our tour will take us
to the fascinating island

121
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:51,297
of Saint Marie, our
neighboring Republic.

122
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:54,637
We're confident that
you're about to have

123
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:57,967
one of the most exciting,
fun-filled evenings

00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,267
of your entire lives.

125
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:02,979
There is something for you all,

126
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,981
seen to the taste of the artist,

127
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,059
with an eye to the
beauty of the exotic,

128
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:12,063
to restless spirits in
search of excitement,

129
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:13,945
everywhere and anywhere,

130
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:17,151
to the photographer
who wishes to preserve

131
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,488
this singular haven forever.

132
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:23,909
For you sir, will be matchless
scenes for wonderment.

133
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:27,087
Strange activities for
the students of life

134
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:30,336
and human nature who
wish to understand

135
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:33,089
the wellspring of
life mysteries.

136
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:36,637
That's what the
Caribbean is all about.

137
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,619
This way.

138
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:51,507
Come on.

139
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,460
I can't wait to
see what's there.

140
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:01,051
Okay, here we have
a French red port.

141
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,101
Where are you taking me?

142
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,774
It's a surprise.

143
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,773
There are people upstairs.

144
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,230
Don't worry, I
paid the captain $20.

145
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:18,610
We got complete privacy.

146
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:20,984
I don't know, Joe.

147
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,661
I really don't feel
good about this.

148
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:27,035
Oh, but I feel
very good about this.

149
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:35,425
Where were we?

150
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,671
Oh, right about here.

151
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,213
I don't believe this.

152
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:17,551
I thought you paid $20.

153
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:18,844
I did pay $20.

154
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,137
Open up down there.

155
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:24,092
Ethel has to go to the head.

156
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,140
I do not deserve this.

157
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,138
What the hell do you want?

158
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:29,723
Come on, shake a leg.

159
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:35,403
Why don't you just
throw me over the side?

160
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:37,933
For all the visitors

161
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:39,274
who've come to our shores,

162
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:42,232
you are to be
congratulated above all.

163
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:46,115
You are men and women of great
taste and discrimination.

164
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:49,289
You spare the inhibition
for the love of the genuine.

165
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:52,663
You have demanded a rare
thing, and you shall have it

166
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:56,041
on the beautiful
island of Saint Marie.

167
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:10,931
Okay, all right.

168
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:13,357
Come on.

169
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:14,476
Let's go.

170
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:15,897
Step out.

171
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:17,442
Come on, let's go.

172
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,984
Right this way,
ladies and gentlemen.

173
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,038
Doesn't that look
like a figurine?

174
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:32,741
It does, doesn't it?

175
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,918
I should've brought a camera.

176
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:42,626
What you're about
to see is not black magic,

177
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:45,212
but truly a religious ceremony.

178
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:49,053
Maintain a respectful silence.

179
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:57,102
Watch your step.

180
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,734
I don't think this is for me.

181
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,361
Yeah, I think you're right.

182
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,535
Don't worry, it's just an act.

183
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,122
God, I hope you're right, Steve.

184
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:39,468
Oh, honestly, Eddie, you're
like a love-struck kid.

185
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:41,828
I'm just hungry for you, baby.

186
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,137
Ah, well, it's getting late.

187
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,219
You're going to have to wait.

188
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:48,014
Oh, you're as bad as you
were before we got married.

189
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:51,021
I still say we have to wait.

190
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:53,819
And I say it's never too late

191
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,656
for the love.

192
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:34,374
Wow, do you believe this?

193
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:35,170
I don't know.

194
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:36,501
It's too scary for me.

195
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,299
It's poppycock,
don't worry about it.

196
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:40,092
I don't know.

197
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,429
I don't believe it.

198
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:43,254
It's just a show.

199
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:44,930
Seeing is believing.

200
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,467
Hey, where's Donna?

201
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:47,887
She couldn't handle it.

202
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:49,956
She and ed took a walk
in the middle of the mass.

203
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,971
Nevermind them,
where's our tour guide?

204
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,274
That's right.

205
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,642
Maybe the zombies kidnapped him.

206
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:58,398
Don't make jokes,
this is serious.

207
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:02,231
We're all alone here,
god knows where.

208
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,612
Yeah, where is that character?

209
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:07,036
This place is
giving me the creeps.

210
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:11,366
I am telling you,
honey, it was only a show.

211
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:14,168
Joe, I know what I saw.

212
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:15,505
Here you are, reverend.

213
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,330
This is for the
church collection box.

214
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:18,755
Thank you, Mr. Jones.

215
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:21,459
We just aren't getting as
many visitors as we used to.

216
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:24,261
Yes, I'm aware
of that, Mr. Jones.

217
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:25,784
I'm sorry to hear
that, reverend.

218
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:27,890
Do not concern
yourself, Mr. Jones.

219
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:33,725
The gods will provide
me with other means.

220
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:36,766
Best you go look
after our guests.

221
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:37,691
Right you are, reverend.

222
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,028
Mr. Jones,

223
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:47,235
Take this to help
you guide your way.

224
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,682
Thank you, reverend, goodnight.

225
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:52,244
Farewell, Mr. Jones, farewell.

226
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:55,795
What was that?

227
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,291
Simply the cry of a
jungle bird, my dear.

228
00:20:58,632 --> 00:20:59,747
Where'd he come from?

229
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,611
Now, my friends, I'd best
get you back to the boat

230
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:02,750
in time for dinner.

231
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,551
This way, please. - Let's go.

232
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:06,470
Let's get out of here.

233
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:09,601
Jungle bird.

234
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:13,435
Would someone please
get those torches, please?

235
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,940
Boy, I've had enough
for one evening.

236
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:28,901
Careful, watch your steps.

237
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,172
Hey there, Roy!

238
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,171
Here we are, start her up!

239
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:47,514
Watch it now.

240
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,122
- Let's get out of here.
- Come on, Roy,

241
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,506
start her up!
I didn't think it'd

242
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:56,564
be like this.

243
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:57,709
If I knew it was
gonna be like that,

244
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,724
I wouldn't have taken you.

245
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:06,446
Roy, Roy.

246
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:10,912
Here.

247
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:12,997
What's the problem?

248
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,518
A bit of an accident I'm afraid.

249
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:15,727
What kind of an accident?

250
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:16,751
I'm sure I don't know,

251
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:18,561
but our driver seems
to have disappeared.

252
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,460
Wait a minute, what's that?

253
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:23,293
Haven't the foggiest.

254
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,467
Hey, buster, we supposed to
stand around her all night?

255
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:29,420
The driver seems
to have taken off.

256
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:32,131
Hey, chamley, the keys
are in here, let's go.

257
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:34,550
Of course, of
course, silly of me.

258
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:36,977
- Yeah.
- That's for sure.

259
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:39,033
- Come on, everybody.
- All aboard, let's go!

260
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,644
Everything shipshape shortly.

261
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:46,062
George, where do
you wanna sit at?

262
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:48,443
Here by the window, you
wanna sit by the window?

263
00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:02,732
Look at this,
everything we do something

264
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:03,775
I'd rather not. - That's done.

265
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:04,879
What's up, chamley?

266
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,570
Oh, I can't believe this.

267
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:07,594
Do you believe this?

268
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,176
- Oh, boy.
- I can't believe this.

269
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:17,247
- What's the matter now?
- Come on, chamley.

270
00:23:17,271 --> 00:23:19,227
Come on, come on, come on.

271
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:22,807
Do you believe this?

272
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:25,359
- My lord.
- Come on, it's a motor.

273
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,235
See you outside a minute.

274
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:29,989
Where you goin'?

275
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:34,238
That explains it.

276
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,116
That explains what?

277
00:23:36,457 --> 00:23:38,288
Somebody took the
distributor cap.

278
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:39,957
Roy must've taken it with him.

279
00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:41,294
Yeah, why?

280
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:43,244
So no one would steal the bus.

281
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:45,796
Uh-huh, won't even
do any good to hotwire.

282
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:48,468
Hotwire?

283
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,670
Just take my word for it.

284
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:51,052
Without a distributor cap,

285
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,673
we'll never get
this thing moving.

286
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:55,097
Well then there's
only one thing for it.

287
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:56,514
What?

288
00:23:56,852 --> 00:24:00,185
There's a phone booth
just down the road.

289
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:02,262
I'll have to go ahead
and call for help.

290
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:03,768
Hey, Paul, what's going on?

291
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:05,766
I'll be with you in a minute.

292
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:08,568
Listen, this is your
tour, Mr. Jones.

293
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:11,022
You got us here,
you'll get us out.

294
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:14,200
Oh, yes, yes, yes,
of course, of course.

295
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:17,152
That will be the thing
to do, wouldn't it?

296
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,663
Right, get with it.

297
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Sure.

298
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:35,296
- Oh god, come on.
- Come on.

299
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,827
Probably makin' love somewhere.

300
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:39,591
What's the holdup, huh?

301
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:42,178
Looks like the driver
hurt himself somehow.

302
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,041
He must've gone to
get help for himself.

303
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:45,514
What's wrong with the motor?

304
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:47,683
The driver took the
distributor cap with him.

305
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:49,643
What on earth for?

306
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:52,605
So the natives wouldn't
steal the bus, that's obvious.

307
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:55,220
So what are we
supposed to do now?

308
00:24:55,244 --> 00:24:56,844
Our charming guide's
gone down the road

309
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,110
to use the pay phone.

310
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:00,571
I knew something
terrible was gonna happen.

311
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,330
Nothing terrible has happened.

312
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,104
Every since they
started playin' around

313
00:25:04,128 --> 00:25:05,538
with those dead bodies.

314
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:06,838
This is dreadful.

315
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:08,037
Lousy service, I say.

316
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:10,668
I'm perfectly happy right here.

317
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,170
Mm-hmm, I heard that.

318
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:14,229
Hey, listen, while
everybody's carrying on,

319
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:15,628
what happened to the newlyweds?

320
00:25:15,806 --> 00:25:17,296
- Ed and Donna.
- Oh they probably,

321
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:18,618
they're fine.
I completely forgot

322
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:19,176
about them.

323
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:20,598
We should look for 'em.

324
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:22,247
Oh, I hope they're all right.

325
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:22,930
I do too.

326
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:24,808
Don't worry about them.

327
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:26,149
Why not?

328
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:28,065
You kiddin' me?

329
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:30,987
Roy.

330
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:32,613
Oh my god.

331
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:41,289
Oh no.

332
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:59,088
What in the name of
god is happening?

333
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:39,840
Who'd you study with? Adler?

334
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:41,182
What?

335
00:26:42,226 --> 00:26:43,306
Steve?

336
00:26:43,644 --> 00:26:44,099
Steve?

337
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:44,928
He went down the road.

338
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,270
Down the road?

339
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:48,554
Yeah, to see what's
keepin' the tour man.

340
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:51,231
Oh, yeah, sorry, still drowsy.

341
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:54,977
That must be him now.

342
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:06,072
What's the story?

343
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:07,785
No story.

344
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:09,458
What do you mean?

345
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:12,628
I mean no tour guide, and
the payphone was ripped up.

346
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:13,965
Figures.

347
00:27:14,258 --> 00:27:16,965
So there's nothing,
only this, his hat,

348
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,062
and no chamley what's
his name to go with it.

349
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:21,837
I just knew something
awful was gonna happen.

350
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:24,035
You know, there's somethin'
fishy about all this.

351
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,139
Yeah, voodoo magic maybe.

352
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,263
Hey, honey, don't make jokes.

353
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:28,563
Sorry.

354
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:30,250
Right, we've already
lost two people.

355
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:31,274
Plus the driver.

356
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,690
And now the tour
guide's abandoned us.

357
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:35,983
So, what do we do now, Mr. big?

358
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,687
Beats the hell outta me,
not my kind of decision.

359
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:41,398
What doesn't
everybody just relax?

360
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:44,075
This is supposed to be
a fun picnic, remember?

361
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:47,951
We can always contact
the voodoo people.

362
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:50,415
Not on your life.

363
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:52,617
There's one thing I'm
certainly not doing.

364
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:53,998
What's that?

365
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:56,218
Spending my night cooped
up on this stupid bus.

366
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,486
Yeah, this place is gettin'
creepier by the minute.

367
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,546
Wait a minute, there's
always the house.

368
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:01,888
What house?

369
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:02,761
That villa a couple
of miles down the road.

370
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:04,383
I didn't see any villa.

371
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:06,119
That's because you don't
have my fine painter's eye.

372
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:06,757
It's on the map.

373
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:08,717
Hey, maybe they have a phone.

374
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:10,347
Yeah, and maybe they don't.

375
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:15,023
Listen, Joe, anything's
better than just sitting here.

376
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,897
With zombies coming to life
over there, no thank you.

377
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:20,198
Hey, hold your horses,
maybe we'll be better off

378
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:22,068
waiting here until morning.

379
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:24,049
How many people wanna
stay here tonight,

380
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:26,117
or how many wanna try
and get to the house?

381
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,059
- I agree with Joe.
- Hold it, hold it.

382
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,698
Hold it, hold it.
I agree with Joe.

383
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:34,751
Let's try it again,
this time with the hands.

384
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:35,793
No, George, not with

385
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,204
your condition. - Joel

386
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:40,256
listen, some zombie cuts my
throat, what good's my heart?

387
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:42,050
We go with the majority.

388
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:45,094
Okay, that's it,
all hands, let's go.

389
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:59,314
I guess it's okay.

390
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:00,189
Take this.

391
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:01,530
Why me?

392
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:03,426
Angel, you're the
one who saw the villa.

393
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,656
You lead the way.

394
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,262
I really don't think
this is such a great idea.

395
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:07,696
Just watch your footing.

396
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:09,349
Okay, it's kinda treacherous.

397
00:29:09,373 --> 00:29:11,739
Oh, I'm right here,
I'm right here.

398
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:17,877
Hey, what's happening?

399
00:29:18,215 --> 00:29:19,625
Seeing what else we can use.

400
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:24,537
This should come in handy for
chopping a trail or something.

401
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:26,177
Yeah, something like a zombie.

402
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,386
Ah, here's a first-aid kit,

403
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:32,207
in case we have to
patch him up again.

404
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:33,479
That's it?

405
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:37,477
Nah, hold it,
here's another light.

406
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,268
Oh, yeah, this will light
the way for the honeymooners.

407
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:43,820
Great, but hurry up, okay?

408
00:30:07,097 --> 00:30:08,678
Just be careful, we'll make it.

409
00:30:09,016 --> 00:30:10,756
Everybody watch
their step, okay?

410
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,161
Here, let me have this back.

411
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:13,185
Thanks.

412
00:30:13,687 --> 00:30:14,267
Hold up.

413
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:15,563
What's wrong?

414
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:17,725
The honeymooners, we, uh,

415
00:30:19,276 --> 00:30:20,878
we gotta try and tell 'em
how to find the house.

416
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,108
Well, how do we do that?

417
00:30:22,446 --> 00:30:23,811
I'll leave instructions.

418
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:25,156
Anybody got some paper?

419
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:25,945
- Yeah, I do.
- I don't.

420
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:27,572
Oh, good.

421
00:30:27,868 --> 00:30:28,868
Here, take this.

422
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:29,569
Sure.

423
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:32,027
You sure you
wanna go back there?

424
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:34,172
I'm sure I don't want
them on my conscience.

425
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:34,992
- Be careful.
- Okay, but we'll

426
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:36,334
take it slow, all right?

427
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:37,626
Don't worry about it.

428
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:38,578
There's only one road.
You take care, all right.

429
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,534
Hey, what happened?

430
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,666
I forgot my books.

431
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:43,292
That is not funny.

432
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:44,944
- All right.
- Do you think they're fine?

433
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:46,154
What's so funny about being out

434
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:47,964
in this jungle?
I thought it was funny.

435
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,697
There's someone coming!

436
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:15,945
- Oh, Paul.
- Hey, hey, Paul.

437
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:17,604
Hey, Paul, what happened?

438
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:20,036
- Yeah, Paul.
- Tell me.

439
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:22,705
Got jumped, that's
what happened.

440
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,001
It was hidin' on the bus.

441
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:26,618
That son of a bitch hit
me like a ton of bricks.

442
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:27,418
Well, who was it?

443
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:28,756
Who the hell knows?

444
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:29,798
The voodoo people.

445
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:32,545
Sandy, you got
voodoo of the mind.

446
00:33:32,886 --> 00:33:33,545
Well, who else?

447
00:33:33,887 --> 00:33:35,156
Well, maybe it was that driver,

448
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,841
maybe he went off his
rocker or something.

449
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:39,285
He looked like a weed head
to me right from the start.

450
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:40,719
It wasn't the driver.

451
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:42,061
A zombie perhaps?

452
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:44,849
Here, you tell me.

453
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,190
What's that?

454
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:48,227
I chopped it off
him, whatever it is.

455
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:49,968
Maybe one of them savages.

456
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:52,106
It looks like a bird or a bear.

457
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:54,007
Look, it doesn't
matter who right now,

458
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,944
all I know is
homicidal, you read me?

459
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:59,241
It was trying to
kill me, got it?

460
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:02,321
Okay, so where in the hell
is this house of yours?

461
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:04,531
As a matter of fact
it's right up there.

462
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,877
At least there's
still a light in the window.

463
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:12,126
Oh, George, this
is no time for jokes.

464
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,048
Laughter's the best medicine.

465
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:16,047
The reader's digest says so.

466
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:17,698
George, you're incorrigible.

467
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,508
- Among other things.
- All right, let's go.

468
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:21,088
Let's try to make it, all right?

469
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:23,474
We're right behind you.

470
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:25,723
We're almost there now.

471
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,476
Maybe we'd be
better off on our own.

472
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:30,057
There just a bunch of jinx.

473
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:35,104
Suit yourself, Matt, with
me, it's safety in numbers.

474
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:47,574
Jesus, some people.

475
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,079
Stop complaining.

476
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:50,541
He nearly took my eye out.

477
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:51,983
The only thing
puttin' your eye out

478
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:53,747
is that pretty young
butt up front there.

479
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,820
What in the
hell you talkin' about?

480
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:59,382
Matt, Matt,
I'm runnin' out of steam here.

481
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:01,262
What do ya want,
upper or downer?

482
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:03,799
Come on, upper, upper.

483
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:05,144
Here.

484
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:06,388
Thanks, hon.

485
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:07,748
If I'd known it was this steep.

486
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,888
I know, we wouldn't be here.

487
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:38,425
I don't love the
sound of that drum.

488
00:35:38,762 --> 00:35:40,343
Drummer you know?

489
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:45,431
Hold it a sec.

490
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:47,305
What's the problem now?

491
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:48,646
Not sure.

492
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:51,684
You smell it?

493
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:54,186
Yes, skunk cabbage.

494
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:56,358
Yeah, it smells
like rotten eggs.

495
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:58,186
No, rotten meat.

496
00:35:58,531 --> 00:35:59,862
I smelled it back at the bus.

497
00:36:01,034 --> 00:36:02,034
It's following us.

498
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:02,907
Oh god.

499
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:04,989
It's okay, let's not panic.

500
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:06,330
Hey, we're almost there.

501
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:08,017
The house can't be but another
quarter of a mile or so

502
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:10,032
down the path. - George, George!

503
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:21,171
George, oh my god, my god,
it's his heart, George.

504
00:36:25,475 --> 00:36:26,475
George.

505
00:36:28,645 --> 00:36:30,181
Oh my god, George.

506
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:33,267
Oh my god, it's his heart.

507
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:35,728
Damn!

508
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:37,934
- Come on.
- Come on, do something.

509
00:36:38,238 --> 00:36:39,523
Oh, George.

510
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:40,823
Here, George.

511
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:41,487
All right.

512
00:36:41,825 --> 00:36:42,825
Oh, George.

513
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:48,193
Do you think we can carry him?

514
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:50,371
Yeah, we could,
but we shouldn't.

515
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:53,041
Yeah, I read you,
so what do we do?

516
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:56,043
You guys go up to the house
and get help if you can.

517
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:57,621
Well, what about you?

518
00:36:57,966 --> 00:37:00,423
I'll stay here with
him until you get back.

519
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,340
Yeah, but what about...

520
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:04,048
Get goin', I'll hold the fort.

521
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:07,808
Okay, folks.

522
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:11,145
Paul and George are gonna
take a little rest here,

523
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:13,432
the rest go to the house
and get help, okay?

524
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,013
I'm not leaving him!

525
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:16,017
I'll look after him.

526
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:17,974
I am not leaving him!

527
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:21,757
Okay, we'll go for help and
be back before you know it.

528
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:23,271
I'm not leaving him.

529
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:30,112
- Come on, honey.
- George.

530
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:34,249
He's gonna be fine, right?

531
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:36,083
He's gonna be fine.

532
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:22,421
Watch it, Joe.

533
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:26,175
I'm gonna go first.

534
00:38:26,513 --> 00:38:28,128
One at a time.

535
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:35,269
It's beautiful, come on.

536
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,095
Hey, you're all so slow.

537
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,440
Make way, come on.

538
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,013
Some of these things are loose.

539
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,858
Hey, Sandy, this
isn't very sturdy.

540
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:55,864
Come on, honey.

541
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:56,743
Watch out.

542
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,328
Jerry.

543
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,160
It's all right, it's all right.

544
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:01,505
Come on.

545
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:03,500
I'm comin', all right.

546
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:07,094
Jerry!

547
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:10,639
Helen!

548
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:15,057
- Jerry!
- Jerry!

549
00:39:15,395 --> 00:39:16,395
Helen!

550
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:17,143
Helen!

551
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,480
Go on, do something!

552
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:19,387
It's too late!

553
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:20,812
I can't see them!

554
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:22,474
- Oh my god!
- Helen, Jerry!

555
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,820
Helen!

556
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:35,537
Hey, what's that?

557
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:36,874
Do you see him?

558
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:39,282
I don't know, there's
something over there.

559
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:40,627
Jerry! - My god.

560
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:45,584
Jerry!

561
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:01,732
What happened?

562
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:02,893
An accident.

563
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,795
Helen and Jerry, they went
under, slipped, I think.

564
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:05,934
You think?

565
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:07,564
It was hard to tell.

566
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:09,383
Listen, Helen was almost
over to the other side,

567
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,093
and then suddenly she
was falling in the water.

568
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:13,358
Yeah, and Jerry
dove in to help her.

569
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:15,264
What's the matter, didn't
they see something over there?

570
00:40:15,288 --> 00:40:16,949
Oh, Paul, it
happened so quickly.

571
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:20,657
It was over like that.

572
00:40:21,002 --> 00:40:22,117
Hey, Joe, hey, Matt,

573
00:40:22,462 --> 00:40:23,782
did you see what happened? What?

574
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:24,922
No.

575
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:26,542
Man, it's so dark I can't

576
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,672
see anything.

577
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:35,474
Damn!

578
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:40,687
Steve.

579
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:42,433
Oh, take it easy, hon.

580
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:44,054
I can't take much more of this.

581
00:41:22,105 --> 00:41:23,641
Bastard, come out!

582
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:31,819
Come on, we can't wait
around here all night!

583
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:35,444
Hold your horses,
we're waiting for Paul.

584
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:39,746
Bad?

585
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:41,324
Yeah.

586
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:42,200
Oh god.

587
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:43,542
Both of them?

588
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:44,206
Yeah.

589
00:41:44,544 --> 00:41:45,158
What do we do?

590
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:46,503
We can't leave 'em there.

591
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:49,208
We can, unless you go suicide.

592
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:51,379
Who was it?

593
00:41:51,718 --> 00:41:53,049
Did you see what it was?

594
00:41:53,386 --> 00:41:54,386
No.

595
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:57,591
Must've been some kind
of crazy, human or not.

596
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:58,546
Listen, let's get
to the house first,

597
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:00,222
then decide what to do, okay?

598
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,925
Yeah, right, you two go ahead.

599
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:29,665
What happened,
how did she fall in?

600
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:31,126
- I couldn't see.
- Hey hero,

601
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:34,378
thought you were gonna stay
back there and cover our asses.

602
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:36,926
From now on, Matt, you
better cover your own ass.

603
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:39,504
What's that supposed to mean?

604
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:43,178
It means that some thing
out there is after us.

605
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:45,093
You gotta be kidding.

606
00:42:45,438 --> 00:42:46,598
What did we do to anybody?

607
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:47,898
Yeah, who knows?

608
00:42:48,024 --> 00:42:49,639
It doesn't seem to matter.

609
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:50,984
Paul, tell them.

610
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:54,686
George and Ethel,
they're both dead.

611
00:42:55,031 --> 00:42:55,611
Murdered.

612
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:56,948
Oh my god.

613
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:00,529
First Helen and Jerry,
and now George and Ethel.

614
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:02,656
Somebody out there
wants us all dead.

615
00:43:03,873 --> 00:43:04,988
Sure?

616
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:06,701
You wanna stay and check it out?

617
00:43:09,629 --> 00:43:10,629
Keep goin', baby.

618
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:12,839
Matt, take it easy.

619
00:43:13,049 --> 00:43:14,068
We'll take it easy
as soon as we get

620
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:15,092
to this house up there.

621
00:43:17,637 --> 00:43:20,720
Whoa, we better
think this one over.

622
00:43:21,057 --> 00:43:21,716
Why?

623
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:23,381
Why?

624
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:26,721
Because that nutcase may be
operating out of the house.

625
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:28,136
Yeah, who knows?

626
00:43:28,481 --> 00:43:30,681
But right now he's behind us
across the river there, so.

627
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:33,315
So we check out the house, okay?

628
00:43:34,654 --> 00:43:35,654
Okay.

629
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:41,398
I knew we never should've come.

630
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:42,702
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

631
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:44,410
Mexico would've
been so much nicer.

632
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:46,391
Yeah all those greasers
with their guitars.

633
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:48,906
I love guitars.

634
00:44:19,115 --> 00:44:20,342
- Come on.
- Let's get out of here.

635
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:21,385
- Let's go.
- Come on, come on.

636
00:44:21,409 --> 00:44:22,409
Let's go.

637
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:28,621
Jesus, what
the hell is going on?

638
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:33,834
Don't stop and think about it.

639
00:44:51,981 --> 00:44:53,972
We've got a road.

640
00:44:54,317 --> 00:44:56,182
- Nice, nice.
- Fantastic.

641
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:03,777
Connie, you're
right, here is the house.

642
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:05,118
Watch your step.

643
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:07,781
Now we can get to the telephone.

644
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:47,157
Hello?

645
00:45:47,495 --> 00:45:48,701
Anybody home?

646
00:45:49,038 --> 00:45:51,074
If Igor answers, I'm leaving.

647
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:52,415
Igor?

648
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,019
You know, Igor, Dr.
Frankenstein's Butler.

649
00:45:54,043 --> 00:45:54,498
Sick.

650
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:56,575
No, I'm not sick,

651
00:45:56,921 --> 00:46:01,665
just playing it safe.

652
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:09,004
- Look at his place.
- Hello?

653
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:12,143
Anybody home?

654
00:46:13,396 --> 00:46:16,138
It's an emergency,
we need a telephone.

655
00:46:24,365 --> 00:46:25,365
Hello!

656
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:35,656
Does anybody have a match?

657
00:46:36,002 --> 00:46:37,002
Yeah.

658
00:46:49,849 --> 00:46:51,134
Ah, civilization.

659
00:46:52,393 --> 00:46:53,974
It's like everybody
left in a hurry.

660
00:46:54,312 --> 00:46:55,768
If they left.

661
00:46:57,148 --> 00:46:58,809
And what's that
supposed to mean?

662
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:04,728
Well they could, couldn't they?

663
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,986
Paul, let's check it out.

664
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:13,907
Keep an eye on the girls, okay?

665
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:15,248
Okay.

666
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:22,583
I've got a splitting headache.

667
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:26,586
Small wonder, I think
I've got some aspirin.

668
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:28,007
Just like a girl scout.

669
00:47:28,346 --> 00:47:29,346
Always prepared.

670
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:35,174
Thank you.

671
00:47:35,478 --> 00:47:37,434
Let's see if we
can find some water.

672
00:48:02,505 --> 00:48:03,745
A light.

673
00:48:23,234 --> 00:48:26,692
You don't bother him,
he won't bother you.

674
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:30,442
More good news, no
dead bodies upstairs.

675
00:48:30,783 --> 00:48:32,774
Ladies, I'll take care of this.

676
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:28,496
You know, if you ask me,

677
00:49:28,841 --> 00:49:30,923
I think everybody is
missing the point.

678
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:32,670
Oh, and what's that?

679
00:49:33,012 --> 00:49:33,626
Well, I think we
should be trying

680
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:35,260
to get in touch with someone

681
00:49:35,556 --> 00:49:37,387
to tell 'em what's
happening to us.

682
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:42,393
J da da da da da da da da

683
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:45,722
here's some more
news, good and bad.

684
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:47,556
First the bad news.

685
00:49:48,736 --> 00:49:51,318
No telephone calls, that's out.

686
00:49:52,615 --> 00:49:54,947
And now the good news.

687
00:49:56,827 --> 00:50:00,115
Now we got some real protection.

688
00:50:00,456 --> 00:50:01,816
Where the hell
did you find that?

689
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:03,242
Out in the backyard.

690
00:50:03,584 --> 00:50:05,245
So they had a shootout here.

691
00:50:06,629 --> 00:50:08,415
I told you they
could all be dead.

692
00:50:08,756 --> 00:50:09,996
Is that thing loaded?

693
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:11,672
Yeah, but only two rounds.

694
00:50:12,635 --> 00:50:15,001
Please, Joe, be careful.

695
00:50:15,346 --> 00:50:17,678
Don't worry, I've been
handling guns all my life.

696
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:18,720
Is that a fact?

697
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:20,597
That is a fact.

698
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:27,023
Can I take a look?

699
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:31,316
If you're gonna
wear it like that,

700
00:50:32,905 --> 00:50:34,315
you better keep it like this.

701
00:50:35,658 --> 00:50:37,614
An accident wouldn't
make Sandy very happy,

702
00:50:38,911 --> 00:50:40,196
or you, baby.

703
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:41,653
Ah.

704
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:42,997
Oh no.

705
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,040
Terrific.

706
00:50:44,959 --> 00:50:45,959
Damn it.

707
00:50:46,085 --> 00:50:47,085
Just what we need.

708
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:49,754
Damn it.

709
00:50:49,964 --> 00:50:51,204
Old places like this,

710
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:53,964
they're usually on generators.

711
00:50:55,553 --> 00:50:56,918
We'd better check the basement.

712
00:50:59,098 --> 00:51:00,634
You three will be okay.

713
00:51:00,975 --> 00:51:02,806
Are you kidding,
with this Cannon?

714
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:05,558
Come on, Joe.

715
00:51:06,647 --> 00:51:08,308
This is not high noon.

716
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:12,812
Please put that away until we
really have reason to use it.

717
00:51:14,822 --> 00:51:15,822
All right.

718
00:51:19,994 --> 00:51:23,031
God, watch that
grate on the floor.

719
00:51:23,372 --> 00:51:25,033
This looks like it.

720
00:51:25,374 --> 00:51:26,864
Give it a crank.

721
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:30,044
Ah.

722
00:51:32,298 --> 00:51:37,167
Hey, anybody know what
anthropophagy or phagy is?

723
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:40,179
Mm-mm, not I.

724
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:42,849
Joe.

725
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:47,061
Joe.

726
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:49,268
What?

727
00:51:49,607 --> 00:51:51,327
You took anthropology
35, you oughta know.

728
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:55,267
How do you spell it.

729
00:51:55,613 --> 00:51:57,729
Well, it's anthro, and then it's

730
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:07,621
P-o-p-h-a-g-y.

731
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:08,958
Cannibalism.

732
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:11,127
What?

733
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:14,127
Oh my god.

734
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:19,709
This whole shelf here in
German, French, and Italian,

735
00:52:20,054 --> 00:52:21,840
and all on cannibalism.

736
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:26,510
Hey, you know, you're right.

737
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:28,012
Ah, what do they say?

738
00:52:28,354 --> 00:52:28,843
Different strokes for

739
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:30,146
different folks. - Joel

740
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:31,397
hey.

741
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:34,689
What's wrong?

742
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:37,814
That awful smell,
it's back again.

743
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:41,693
Jesus, I forgot
to lock the door!

744
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:48,078
Connie, warn the other guys.

745
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:51,125
Go.

746
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:54,993
Sandy, get outta sight.

747
00:52:56,507 --> 00:52:57,507
Sandy, go.

748
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:00,382
I can't move.

749
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:09,345
Don't move.

750
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:12,803
Joe!

751
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:13,853
Shh.

752
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:15,264
Don't leave me.

753
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:18,100
I promise I'll be right back.

754
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:24,781
Joe, don't go.

755
00:53:40,843 --> 00:53:43,084
Okay, good, go ahead.

756
00:53:43,429 --> 00:53:46,387
All righty.

757
00:53:46,724 --> 00:53:49,431
Steve, the zombie's
trying to break in.

758
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:55,868
Joe, hey, Joel

759
00:54:56,877 --> 00:54:58,117
you all right?

760
00:55:02,591 --> 00:55:03,591
Just one shot.

761
00:55:03,884 --> 00:55:07,001
Bastard's quick as lightning.

762
00:55:07,346 --> 00:55:08,552
Goodbye 38.

763
00:55:08,889 --> 00:55:10,345
Goodbye Joe, too.

764
00:55:11,642 --> 00:55:12,722
The bad guy's got it now.

765
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:15,142
You wanna go up against
him with just that?

766
00:55:15,479 --> 00:55:16,479
No way.

767
00:55:42,089 --> 00:55:44,330
It's that monster.

768
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:45,915
That thing got him.

769
00:55:49,263 --> 00:55:51,754
I asked him not to leave me.

770
00:55:52,099 --> 00:55:53,635
Told him not to go out there.

771
00:55:53,976 --> 00:55:55,557
I pleaded with him.

772
00:55:57,062 --> 00:55:58,062
But no, no,

773
00:56:00,107 --> 00:56:01,722
had to be the cowboy,

774
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:06,773
just like a little boy,
playin' stupid cowboy.

775
00:56:24,298 --> 00:56:26,630
This just can't be happening.

776
00:56:26,967 --> 00:56:29,333
I don't believe that
I'll never see him again.

777
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:34,296
He was always
playing tricks on me,

778
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:38,475
little boy tricks, scary
sometimes, but always fun.

779
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:42,804
We'd fight and make up,

780
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:45,357
but it was just a
big game between us.

781
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:49,269
I can't believe it was the
last time, I just can't.

782
00:56:49,615 --> 00:56:52,607
It's not fair, and
I won't believe it.

783
00:56:53,869 --> 00:56:55,200
I need you, Joe.

784
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:04,706
Sandy, maybe he'll turn up.

785
00:57:05,047 --> 00:57:06,662
Turn up?

786
00:57:07,007 --> 00:57:08,668
What, like the others?

787
00:57:09,009 --> 00:57:12,126
Lying in a filthy pit,
skinned like a rabbit!

788
00:57:12,471 --> 00:57:14,336
Sandy, that's not gonna happen.

789
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:18,173
He was such a sweet
guy, like a little boy,

790
00:57:20,312 --> 00:57:22,644
but he was gentle and sweet.

791
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:47,710
I'll get the lights.

792
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:02,186
It's up here.

793
00:58:11,405 --> 00:58:13,987
We can't go up against
a 38 with just that.

794
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:16,440
There's only one slug left.

795
00:58:16,785 --> 00:58:17,785
You wanna be a hero?

796
00:58:19,246 --> 00:58:21,828
No thanks, how "bout you?

797
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:23,165
Wait a minute.

798
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:25,869
Well, what else is there?

799
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:28,205
Quarter coil stretching.

800
00:58:35,387 --> 00:58:36,387
Steve!

801
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:41,264
Let's get the hell out of here.

802
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:51,558
What's going on?

803
00:58:52,821 --> 00:58:53,821
A welcoming mat.

804
00:58:54,114 --> 00:58:55,820
For our friend the zombie.

805
00:58:56,116 --> 00:58:57,276
You mean fried zombie.

806
00:59:08,003 --> 00:59:09,368
I certainly hope it works.

807
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:17,470
How you comin'?

808
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:18,554
Okay, I'm set.

809
00:59:18,889 --> 00:59:20,345
All right, let's
scoot it the rest.

810
00:59:49,628 --> 00:59:52,370
Were you really serious?

811
00:59:52,714 --> 00:59:53,999
About you?

812
00:59:54,341 --> 00:59:55,341
Very serious.

813
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:59,292
Lucky me, after all, this
is Caribbean, isn't it?

814
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:02,008
Boy meets girl, vice versa.

815
01:00:02,349 --> 01:00:04,010
I meant about fried zombies.

816
01:00:06,478 --> 01:00:08,935
Listen, I don't know
what to believe anymore.

817
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:13,766
Walking corpses, zombies,
bacchus or whatever.

818
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:16,772
What do you think, Paul?

819
01:00:18,073 --> 01:00:19,438
Up till now,

820
01:00:19,741 --> 01:00:21,302
all the monsters that
I've seen has been human.

821
01:00:21,326 --> 01:00:22,646
I've give anything.

822
01:01:09,541 --> 01:01:10,621
Where'd he go?

823
01:01:10,959 --> 01:01:12,290
He just disappeared.

824
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:14,627
We'll just try and find
out what happened to Joe.

825
01:01:31,146 --> 01:01:32,146
Hey, Steve.

826
01:01:39,738 --> 01:01:40,738
Look.

827
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:45,823
Looks like it goes off this way.

828
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:50,956
Ah, jeez.

829
01:01:56,588 --> 01:01:57,588
Just one round left.

830
01:01:59,466 --> 01:02:01,832
Too bad he didn't
have time to use it.

831
01:02:02,177 --> 01:02:03,177
Let's hope we do.

832
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:32,116
Hold it right there, mister.

833
01:02:32,457 --> 01:02:35,449
Anything you say, friend.

834
01:02:35,794 --> 01:02:36,834
What are you doing here?

835
01:02:37,045 --> 01:02:39,912
Oh, I'm trackin' that critter
that just bust outta here.

836
01:02:40,257 --> 01:02:41,497
You get him?

837
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:44,833
No, no, he moves
faster than lightning,

838
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:46,543
but I will eventually though.

839
01:02:46,888 --> 01:02:50,346
Okay, come up,
but nice and slow.

840
01:02:50,684 --> 01:02:53,767
Oh, that's
the only way I can take it.

841
01:02:55,105 --> 01:02:57,141
I've been Mickey mousing
around these jungles

842
01:02:57,482 --> 01:02:59,188
for the past two, three days.

843
01:03:00,485 --> 01:03:01,925
What have you been
doing out there?

844
01:03:02,237 --> 01:03:06,526
I told ya, I've been
trackin' that thing, or things.

845
01:03:09,286 --> 01:03:12,778
Name's Whitney, ely Whitney.

846
01:03:14,833 --> 01:03:18,621
I had a house over there,
other side of the valley.

847
01:03:18,962 --> 01:03:19,542
Had a house?

848
01:03:19,838 --> 01:03:22,545
Yeah, yeah, he burned me out.

849
01:03:22,882 --> 01:03:24,588
It's custom around
here, it seems.

850
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,625
Me, I'm from Boston originally.

851
01:03:27,971 --> 01:03:29,677
I retired down here

852
01:03:30,015 --> 01:03:32,097
to get away from those
new england winters.

853
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:35,725
What do I get instead, huh?

854
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:37,222
What did you get?

855
01:03:37,564 --> 01:03:40,522
Trouble, trouble, there's
nothing but trouble.

856
01:03:40,859 --> 01:03:41,859
From the critter?

857
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:47,479
Killed my wife,
murdered my partner.

858
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:48,824
Who did that?

859
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:54,619
Political terrorists,
Indians, crazy on ganja weed,

860
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:59,374
or maybe some prehistoric
tribe, beats me.

861
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:03,081
Bloodthirsty's all
I know, miss, uh?

862
01:04:03,423 --> 01:04:07,507
Sorry, Mr. Whitney,
this is Sandy, this is Connie.

863
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:08,844
Ladies.

864
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:12,671
Well, you boys plan to
spend the night out here?

865
01:04:13,892 --> 01:04:15,177
Okay, hang on.

866
01:04:19,731 --> 01:04:20,811
Where's Joe?

867
01:04:21,149 --> 01:04:22,639
Still no sign of him.

868
01:04:22,984 --> 01:04:24,690
I don't understand, Steve.

869
01:04:42,796 --> 01:04:44,206
Hey, you didn't see Joe, did ya?

870
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:44,956
Who?

871
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:45,787
Joe.

872
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:47,338
Her boyfriend.

873
01:04:47,675 --> 01:04:51,213
Oh, uh, I'm sorry, but
there's nobody else out there,

874
01:04:52,222 --> 01:04:53,803
alive anyway.

875
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:55,860
Is it the voodoo
people who took him away?

876
01:04:56,142 --> 01:04:58,508
Oh, I really don't know.

877
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:00,533
Well, a bunch of us
came up from the port

878
01:05:00,772 --> 01:05:01,932
for the voodoo mass,

879
01:05:02,273 --> 01:05:04,355
and ever since then it's
been nothing but trouble.

880
01:05:04,692 --> 01:05:08,435
Are these murderers, these
monsters, are they cannibals?

881
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:12,068
Well, where the devil
did you get that idea?

882
01:05:12,409 --> 01:05:13,649
Because the bookcase in there

883
01:05:13,701 --> 01:05:15,441
is full of books on cannibalism.

884
01:05:15,787 --> 01:05:18,028
Oh, well, well, I'll tell ya.

885
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:20,367
When Columbus
first arrived here,

886
01:05:20,708 --> 01:05:24,326
these islands were inhabited
by the arawak Indians.

887
01:05:24,671 --> 01:05:26,411
They were beastly types,

888
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:29,668
but then they were
invaded by the caribs.

889
01:05:29,968 --> 01:05:31,708
They came up from
Columbia or Venezuela

890
01:05:32,846 --> 01:05:35,804
they were fierce and
bloodthirsty types.

891
01:05:36,141 --> 01:05:37,972
They swept through
the islands of Cuba

892
01:05:38,268 --> 01:05:39,724
and Haiti and Jamaica.

893
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:43,807
All the islands that we know
today as the caribbeans.

894
01:05:44,149 --> 01:05:46,435
Now, the language that
they spoke was cariban.

895
01:05:47,861 --> 01:05:52,275
The Latin form for cariban is
cannibal, the flesh eaters.

896
01:05:53,825 --> 01:05:56,817
Well, that's what the
caribs really were.

897
01:05:58,288 --> 01:06:01,576
Well, I don't know what
to say about it for today,

898
01:06:01,916 --> 01:06:04,032
but frankly, I don't like
to even think about it.

899
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:10,164
Is there some place here
that I could wash up a bit?

900
01:06:10,508 --> 01:06:11,543
Sure, I'll show you.

901
01:06:13,761 --> 01:06:14,761
Thank you.

902
01:06:36,951 --> 01:06:39,317
What the hell has gone wrong?

903
01:06:41,498 --> 01:06:42,863
Everything!

904
01:06:43,208 --> 01:06:44,448
And now what do we do?

905
01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:48,205
Later, we've got to get
them out of this house.

906
01:06:58,431 --> 01:06:59,867
We're gonna try and
hold 'em till morning,

907
01:06:59,891 --> 01:07:01,427
then we'll make a run for it.

908
01:07:01,726 --> 01:07:03,432
The shotgun will be a big help.

909
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:05,306
It should be light in two hours.

910
01:07:06,564 --> 01:07:07,679
And then what'll we do?

911
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:09,304
Then we tear up and run for it.

912
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:11,603
Yeah, if we have the time.

913
01:07:11,945 --> 01:07:13,145
You know something we don't?

914
01:07:13,238 --> 01:07:14,878
No, but maybe we
should ask Mr. Whitney,

915
01:07:14,989 --> 01:07:16,570
he seems to be the local expert.

916
01:07:16,908 --> 01:07:18,864
Expert, expert on what?

917
01:07:19,202 --> 01:07:20,817
What to expect next.

918
01:07:21,162 --> 01:07:22,681
Well, I don't think that anybody

919
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:24,241
will be safe here any longer.

920
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:26,823
Why not?

921
01:07:27,168 --> 01:07:30,410
As I've told you, arson is
a way of life around here.

922
01:07:30,755 --> 01:07:33,087
You look at a man cross-eyed,
and the next thing you know,

923
01:07:33,383 --> 01:07:35,499
he's burning down your house.

924
01:07:35,843 --> 01:07:37,583
As you've learned,
there's a lot of things

925
01:07:37,929 --> 01:07:38,964
that are an issue here.

926
01:07:40,181 --> 01:07:41,216
Therel

927
01:07:41,558 --> 01:07:44,049
look.

928
01:07:52,986 --> 01:07:54,129
What the hell do we do now?

929
01:07:54,153 --> 01:07:54,733
Hide in the jungle.

930
01:07:55,029 --> 01:07:56,314
Oh, that wouldn't work.

931
01:07:56,656 --> 01:07:57,236
Why not?

932
01:07:57,574 --> 01:07:58,154
Well, they're expert trackers.

933
01:07:58,449 --> 01:08:00,189
They'd furrow us out in no time.

934
01:08:00,535 --> 01:08:01,695
What else is there?

935
01:08:02,036 --> 01:08:03,401
Ambush.

936
01:08:03,746 --> 01:08:04,746
Are you kidding?

937
01:08:04,998 --> 01:08:06,350
There's a million miles
of jungle out there.

938
01:08:06,374 --> 01:08:08,614
True, but we know where they
are now, down by the road,

939
01:08:08,835 --> 01:08:11,827
and to get here, they'll
have to cross the river.

940
01:08:12,171 --> 01:08:15,959
Now, human or subhuman, they'll
take the shortest route,

941
01:08:16,301 --> 01:08:18,963
and especially since
you've wounded one of them.

942
01:08:19,304 --> 01:08:20,714
Okay, let's get organized.

943
01:08:21,055 --> 01:08:22,055
Come on, Sandy.

944
01:08:24,684 --> 01:08:26,265
Here, here, here,
you take these.

945
01:08:27,312 --> 01:08:28,592
You're in better shape than I am

946
01:08:28,896 --> 01:08:30,761
to handle the thunder blast.

947
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:32,107
Out this way.

948
01:08:36,821 --> 01:08:39,904
We've got to get
to the river first.

949
01:08:45,330 --> 01:08:46,330
Joe!

950
01:08:47,415 --> 01:08:48,415
Joel

951
01:08:50,168 --> 01:08:51,168
Joe. - Come on,

952
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:52,210
let's get out of here.

953
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:53,830
No.

954
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:58,800
No.

955
01:09:07,685 --> 01:09:09,016
Are you all right?

956
01:09:09,354 --> 01:09:12,812
It's all right,
it's just a little spill.

957
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:15,811
I twisted somethin'.

958
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:17,152
Can you walk?

959
01:09:17,236 --> 01:09:18,851
I'm afraid not.

960
01:09:19,197 --> 01:09:20,858
You go on ahead,
I'll be all right.

961
01:09:21,199 --> 01:09:22,530
We can't leave him here alone.

962
01:09:22,867 --> 01:09:26,155
No, no, go, my dear, go
ahead, I'll be just fine.

963
01:09:26,496 --> 01:09:27,776
Listen, we can't waste anytime.

964
01:09:28,039 --> 01:09:31,907
Exactly, you've got to
get to the river first.

965
01:09:32,251 --> 01:09:34,833
You go ahead, I'll hide
us in the underbrush.

966
01:09:35,129 --> 01:09:36,129
You sure?

967
01:09:36,464 --> 01:09:37,464
Positive.

968
01:09:39,634 --> 01:09:40,634
Sandy?

969
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:45,712
I'll go with the two of you.

970
01:09:49,102 --> 01:09:51,058
Okay, we'll come back
for you after it's over.

971
01:09:54,857 --> 01:09:55,972
I love you, angel.

972
01:09:56,317 --> 01:09:57,317
Me, too.

973
01:10:17,672 --> 01:10:19,458
Now what the hell
is going on here?

974
01:10:19,799 --> 01:10:22,757
Oh, my dear girl,
it's all very involved.

975
01:10:23,094 --> 01:10:24,379
So uninvolve it, spell it out.

976
01:10:24,721 --> 01:10:26,882
Well, on the last
shipment from Bogota,

977
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:30,090
my business associates, our
local horse-wild friends,

978
01:10:30,435 --> 01:10:33,268
they resorted to the classic.

979
01:10:33,563 --> 01:10:34,563
The what?

980
01:10:34,605 --> 01:10:36,220
Double-cross, and
then he paid off

981
01:10:36,566 --> 01:10:37,976
the Colombians in counterfeit,

982
01:10:38,317 --> 01:10:40,517
and then he and his girlfriend

983
01:10:40,611 --> 01:10:42,818
planned to skip
with the real green.

984
01:10:43,156 --> 01:10:44,191
And so what happened?

985
01:10:44,532 --> 01:10:46,147
Well, the cowboys,
they burned 'em out.

986
01:10:46,492 --> 01:10:48,858
They turned 'em
into chopped meat.

987
01:10:49,203 --> 01:10:52,411
Those savages,
they come up in the middle

988
01:10:52,749 --> 01:10:55,707
of the night and tossed a
couple of molotov cocktails.

989
01:10:56,043 --> 01:11:00,787
The swoosh, a lifetime of work
goes up in smoke and flames.

990
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:03,922
Here everybody has to
handle his own problems.

991
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:05,591
We've got no fire department.

992
01:11:07,138 --> 01:11:10,175
But that was the last problem
Hernandez and his whore

993
01:11:10,516 --> 01:11:11,972
had to face.

994
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:13,310
That's only half of it.

995
01:11:13,436 --> 01:11:14,436
And the other half?

996
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:16,973
Well, there's an
informant on your end.

997
01:11:17,315 --> 01:11:18,315
An informant?

998
01:11:18,608 --> 01:11:19,877
When the Colombians
got a tip that someone

999
01:11:19,901 --> 01:11:22,517
in this tour group had
the cash on this trip,

1000
01:11:22,862 --> 01:11:24,352
they sent up a hit squad.

1001
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:27,508
Fingered directly?
Oh, absolutely not.

1002
01:11:27,533 --> 01:11:29,649
They just simply started
eliminating you one by one,

1003
01:11:29,994 --> 01:11:32,531
and then searching through
the bags for the payment.

1004
01:11:32,872 --> 01:11:34,362
And what's the drill now?

1005
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:35,992
Business as usual, my dear.

1006
01:11:36,334 --> 01:11:37,853
But what about all
that needless hacking up

1007
01:11:37,877 --> 01:11:39,413
of all those people?
My dear girl,

1008
01:11:39,754 --> 01:11:41,710
it's all part of the subculture.

1009
01:11:42,048 --> 01:11:44,790
Women, children, and even
babies are not immune

1010
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:47,546
to their revenge or instruction,

1011
01:11:47,887 --> 01:11:50,219
plus the fact that
I imagine that

1012
01:11:50,556 --> 01:11:52,547
someone employed in torture,

1013
01:11:52,892 --> 01:11:55,554
who's got the goodies
and all of that.

1014
01:11:55,895 --> 01:11:56,509
I don't find it amusing.

1015
01:11:56,854 --> 01:11:58,185
Oh no, well, my dear girl,

1016
01:11:58,523 --> 01:12:00,138
it's all part of
the total scene.

1017
01:12:00,483 --> 01:12:03,099
There's fun and
games and good times.

1018
01:12:04,695 --> 01:12:06,560
Isn't that what
it's all about, huh?

1019
01:12:09,116 --> 01:12:10,356
Sorry.

1020
01:12:10,701 --> 01:12:11,781
Just give me a second.

1021
01:12:12,119 --> 01:12:14,326
Seems that you're a bit
out of condition, my dear.

1022
01:12:17,083 --> 01:12:20,416
This hit squad, Whitney,
why do they smell so awful?

1023
01:12:23,548 --> 01:12:28,292
Why, it's rotten bark and
trees and slimy jungle things.

1024
01:12:30,429 --> 01:12:33,136
It's a concoction that
they smear on themselves

1025
01:12:33,474 --> 01:12:35,465
so they smell like
rotting corpses.

1026
01:12:36,936 --> 01:12:38,216
Certainly isn't Chanel, is it?

1027
01:12:38,312 --> 01:12:42,396
Oh, you're beginning to
feel a little better, I see.

1028
01:12:42,733 --> 01:12:46,191
Well, it's true, but it
keeps the local primitives

1029
01:12:46,529 --> 01:12:49,737
at arm's length, and it
reminds them of their zombies

1030
01:12:50,074 --> 01:12:52,110
and it keeps them at distance.

1031
01:12:52,451 --> 01:12:53,861
It's really quite
amusing though.

1032
01:12:54,203 --> 01:12:57,570
You've got a great
sense of humor, Whitney.

1033
01:12:57,915 --> 01:12:58,915
I'll die laughing.

1034
01:13:00,459 --> 01:13:01,539
I rather doubt it.

1035
01:13:03,087 --> 01:13:05,248
Hernandez and his
whore certainly didn't.

1036
01:13:11,554 --> 01:13:12,874
Well, we beat 'em to it.

1037
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:15,505
Okay, let's cross fire.

1038
01:13:15,850 --> 01:13:18,210
All right, Sandy, you get
behind Paul, all right, come on.

1039
01:13:18,436 --> 01:13:20,472
Gonna take that, come on.

1040
01:13:55,848 --> 01:13:58,965
Steve, looks like
somebody's on our side.

1041
01:14:22,917 --> 01:14:23,917
On!

1042
01:14:42,937 --> 01:14:44,393
Tell, tell, my.

1043
01:14:47,066 --> 01:14:49,148
Your wife, your folks?

1044
01:14:49,485 --> 01:14:51,521
Tell, tell Miami.

1045
01:14:53,114 --> 01:14:54,114
Miami?

1046
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:58,566
Tell Miami, d-e-a.

1047
01:15:01,038 --> 01:15:02,778
You're not dead
yet, I'll get help.

1048
01:15:03,124 --> 01:15:07,868
DEA, drug enforcement agency,

1049
01:15:09,463 --> 01:15:11,169
looking for connection.

1050
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:15,010
With us?

1051
01:15:15,636 --> 01:15:17,627
Like 10 little Indians,

1052
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:21,516
only one left.

1053
01:15:25,604 --> 01:15:26,604
You help.

1054
01:15:34,363 --> 01:15:35,478
I promise.

1055
01:15:43,414 --> 01:15:44,414
Sandy.

1056
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:48,411
Sandy!

1057
01:15:56,427 --> 01:15:57,787
What was all that
shooting about?

1058
01:15:58,054 --> 01:16:01,137
The boys from
Bogota greeting your friends.

1059
01:16:01,474 --> 01:16:03,554
Those animals
been following us all night?

1060
01:16:03,684 --> 01:16:05,644
Trust that everything
has been properly settled.

1061
01:16:05,728 --> 01:16:06,728
I hate loose ends.

1062
01:16:10,524 --> 01:16:11,639
Careful, my dear.

1063
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:17,765
Well, you certainly
seem at home.

1064
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:19,901
Might as well, too,
this is my house.

1065
01:16:20,868 --> 01:16:21,887
But the buyer, you said...

1066
01:16:21,911 --> 01:16:23,321
Ah, that was Hernandez.

1067
01:16:23,662 --> 01:16:26,324
Cocaine cowboys, they
wanted me alive and well,

1068
01:16:26,665 --> 01:16:28,951
at least until I completed
the last transaction.

1069
01:16:30,461 --> 01:16:31,461
You have it?

1070
01:16:31,796 --> 01:16:32,251
Of course.

1071
01:16:32,588 --> 01:16:33,247
Well, let me see it.

1072
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:35,170
Let's see the candy first.

1073
01:16:36,425 --> 01:16:37,835
You are a tough customer.

1074
01:16:39,428 --> 01:16:41,508
I've always been a great
believer of Edgar Allan poe,

1075
01:16:42,515 --> 01:16:44,051
the purloined letter, you know?

1076
01:16:44,391 --> 01:16:46,006
You wanna hide something,

1077
01:16:46,352 --> 01:16:47,432
you hide it in plain sight.

1078
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:53,018
Have no fear, it's top grade.

1079
01:16:53,359 --> 01:16:55,224
Number nine rock.

1080
01:16:55,569 --> 01:16:56,630
Yeah, but you're
supposed to have enough

1081
01:16:56,654 --> 01:16:58,485
for 10 mules to haul
back to the states.

1082
01:16:58,823 --> 01:17:00,609
After I see your end, my dear.

1083
01:17:16,132 --> 01:17:18,589
Five million, us.

1084
01:17:18,926 --> 01:17:20,291
25 million on your end.

1085
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:22,114
Ah, but I'm the
one taking the chance

1086
01:17:22,138 --> 01:17:23,469
getting it back to New York.

1087
01:17:23,806 --> 01:17:27,845
Ah, back to your little
discotheques and playpens.

1088
01:17:28,185 --> 01:17:30,305
My dear friend, don't knock
it if you don't know it.

1089
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:32,386
Of course not, my dear.

1090
01:17:43,909 --> 01:17:47,367
Right this way, my dear girl.

1091
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:50,867
Now, just keep your eye on it.

1092
01:17:55,671 --> 01:17:57,036
Now, ah-hah, magic.

1093
01:18:01,635 --> 01:18:06,504
Ooh, one,

1094
01:18:06,974 --> 01:18:07,974
two.

1095
01:18:12,188 --> 01:18:14,600
Very efficient.

1096
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:17,773
Efficiency is the key
to industry and profit.

1097
01:18:19,403 --> 01:18:20,643
Steve, you startled me.

1098
01:18:20,988 --> 01:18:24,276
Yeah, I'll bet.

1099
01:18:24,617 --> 01:18:25,617
Where are the others?

1100
01:18:25,826 --> 01:18:26,826
Back out there dead.

1101
01:18:27,912 --> 01:18:29,322
Calm down.

1102
01:18:29,663 --> 01:18:32,154
We were ambushed just like
your friend here planned.

1103
01:18:32,499 --> 01:18:34,956
My dear young fellow, you
give me too much credit.

1104
01:18:35,294 --> 01:18:36,694
Steve please, put
that thing away.

1105
01:18:36,754 --> 01:18:38,665
You don't need it here,
we're all friends.

1106
01:18:42,509 --> 01:18:43,509
I can see that.

1107
01:18:43,677 --> 01:18:45,417
Money makes strange bedfellows.

1108
01:18:45,763 --> 01:18:48,926
Young man, this is strictly
a business transaction.

1109
01:18:49,266 --> 01:18:50,266
For how much?

1110
01:18:50,809 --> 01:18:52,174
A few hundred thousand.

1111
01:18:53,938 --> 01:18:58,682
So, 12 people dead for
a few hundred thousand?

1112
01:18:59,026 --> 01:19:01,563
I'm a generous
man, young fellow,

1113
01:19:01,904 --> 01:19:02,923
and now that you're with us,

1114
01:19:02,947 --> 01:19:04,858
I'd be delighted
to share with you.

1115
01:19:07,493 --> 01:19:08,903
Not on your life.

1116
01:19:09,828 --> 01:19:11,739
But I owe it to you.

1117
01:19:13,707 --> 01:19:15,572
Since you've done away
with those animals

1118
01:19:15,918 --> 01:19:17,454
that have been hounding me.

1119
01:19:17,795 --> 01:19:19,956
Start running, baby,
'cause I got news for you,

1120
01:19:20,297 --> 01:19:21,297
the feds are.

1121
01:19:32,810 --> 01:19:34,516
The next one's for you.

1122
01:19:34,853 --> 01:19:35,433
Are you crazy?

1123
01:19:35,771 --> 01:19:36,430
You just killed that poor man.

1124
01:19:36,772 --> 01:19:37,772
Poor man my ass!

1125
01:19:37,982 --> 01:19:39,262
He's another greedy
pig like you.

1126
01:19:59,545 --> 01:20:00,625
Steve, use your head.

1127
01:20:00,963 --> 01:20:02,919
I'm not talking thousands,
I'm talking millions.

1128
01:20:03,257 --> 01:20:04,292
Good to hear.

1129
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:06,874
Tell Paul and Sandy and all
the others dead out there.

1130
01:20:07,219 --> 01:20:08,219
Forget about them.

1131
01:20:08,304 --> 01:20:10,169
I had nothing to do with that.

1132
01:20:10,514 --> 01:20:11,533
Can't you think of the living

1133
01:20:11,557 --> 01:20:13,077
and the living that
we can do together?

1134
01:20:13,225 --> 01:20:14,225
Living?

1135
01:20:14,476 --> 01:20:15,476
What about the loving?

1136
01:20:15,519 --> 01:20:17,080
Wasn't that part of
the package too, angel?

1137
01:20:17,104 --> 01:20:19,015
The loving, of course it is.

1138
01:20:19,356 --> 01:20:21,084
You just told me you
love me only an hour ago.

1139
01:20:21,108 --> 01:20:23,520
Could I possibly change
so much in so little time?

1140
01:20:23,861 --> 01:20:25,397
No, you haven't changed, I have.

1141
01:20:25,738 --> 01:20:28,571
My god, Steve,
please don't kill me.

1142
01:20:30,993 --> 01:20:31,993
Kill you?

1143
01:20:32,286 --> 01:20:33,286
That's not my plan.

1144
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:35,990
What are you
going to do with me?

1145
01:20:36,332 --> 01:20:37,372
Turn you in, sweetheart.

1146
01:20:39,043 --> 01:20:41,003
A dealer like you should
only be 20 years to life.

1147
01:20:41,086 --> 01:20:42,166
Steve, that's not fair.

1148
01:20:42,463 --> 01:20:44,328
I'm not playing a sap
for you anymore, angel.

1149
01:20:46,550 --> 01:20:47,550
Get moving, baby.

1150
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:48,676
I'm frightened, Steve.

1151
01:20:49,011 --> 01:20:50,322
You didn't mind
leading us up here.

1152
01:20:50,346 --> 01:20:52,302
1 can't help it, I'm
scared now, please.

1153
01:20:52,598 --> 01:20:54,213
Don't worry, both
sides were wiped out

1154
01:20:54,558 --> 01:20:55,172
except for you and me.

1155
01:20:55,517 --> 01:20:56,131
Steve please.

1156
01:20:56,477 --> 01:20:57,477
Get moving.

1157
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:03,393
Look, whatever happens, I
want you to know one thing,

1158
01:21:03,734 --> 01:21:05,190
that I really love you.

1159
01:21:05,527 --> 01:21:06,887
Okay, maybe in the
beginning I was,

1160
01:21:07,029 --> 01:21:10,317
I was playing you along, but
the way you stood up tonight.

1161
01:21:14,703 --> 01:21:16,284
I gotta hand it to you.

1162
01:21:16,622 --> 01:21:17,932
When you lie, you
lie beautifully.

1163
01:21:17,956 --> 01:21:19,821
Oh god, no, not a lie.

1164
01:21:20,167 --> 01:21:22,579
The truth, maybe for the
first time in my life.

1165
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:24,330
And for whatever
it's worth to you,

1166
01:21:24,671 --> 01:21:26,582
I really did fall
in love with you.

1167
01:21:26,924 --> 01:21:28,204
Whatever happened in that house,

1168
01:21:28,384 --> 01:21:29,749
had nothing to do
with you or me.

1169
01:21:31,428 --> 01:21:33,965
I really need you in my life.

1170
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:37,840
Steve!

1171
01:21:53,158 --> 01:21:54,158
God.

1172
01:22:50,007 --> 01:22:53,499
You took too long to
reach me, Mr. Jones.

1173
01:22:55,012 --> 01:22:56,548
I'll take that now.

1174
01:22:57,723 --> 01:22:58,723
No way.

1175
01:22:59,641 --> 01:23:01,097
We needn't quarrel, sir.

1176
01:23:03,604 --> 01:23:05,185
Let me go!

1177
01:23:05,522 --> 01:23:06,522
Let me go!

1178
01:23:08,358 --> 01:23:08,892
Sandy!

1179
01:23:09,234 --> 01:23:10,234
Steve!

1180
01:23:11,403 --> 01:23:14,440
Simply quid pro quo.

1181
01:23:42,392 --> 01:23:45,259
I told you the
gods would provide.

1182
01:23:46,647 --> 01:23:50,640
Now, Mr. Jones will escort
you back to your boat.

1183
01:24:00,911 --> 01:24:01,911
This way, folks.

1184
01:24:10,712 --> 01:24:13,044
Good evening, ladies
and gentlemen.

1185
01:24:13,382 --> 01:24:15,373
Jones tours welcomes you.

1186
01:24:15,717 --> 01:24:19,209
L, Reginald chamley
Jones, your tour guide,

1187
01:24:19,513 --> 01:24:20,593
welcome you personally.

1188
01:24:22,599 --> 01:24:25,511
Our tour today, are
you reporting, sir?

1189
01:24:26,770 --> 01:24:27,850
This way, please.

1190
01:24:29,189 --> 01:24:30,645
Our tour today will
take us to one of

1191
01:24:30,983 --> 01:24:34,817
the most fascinating islands
of the beautiful Caribbean.

1192
01:24:35,153 --> 01:24:39,396
I think I can safely promise
you a tour you'll never forget.

1193
01:24:39,741 --> 01:24:42,949
There'll be sights you've
never experienced before.

1194
01:24:43,287 --> 01:24:45,323
Thrills you've never
experienced before.

1195
01:24:53,130 --> 01:24:55,917
Of all the visitors who
come to these parts,

1196
01:24:56,216 --> 01:24:58,002
you are to be congratulated

1197
01:24:58,343 --> 01:24:59,503
above all.

1198
01:24:59,845 --> 01:25:03,463
You are men and women of
great taste and discrimination

1199
01:25:03,807 --> 01:25:07,391
who spurn the artificial,
who demand the genuine,

1200
01:25:07,686 --> 01:25:08,686
real thing.

1201
01:25:09,730 --> 01:25:14,474
You have demanded the real
thing, and you shall have it!

1202
01:25:14,818 --> 01:25:17,560
On the beautiful
island of Saint Marie!

1203
01:25:47,476 --> 01:25:49,341
