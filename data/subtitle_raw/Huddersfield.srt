1
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,154
Oohh!
Fuckin' motherfucker!

2
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,791
Slept at the hotel again?

3
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,953
Fuckin' wise-ass!

4
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,076
For thirty years you're
fucking with me! - Coffee?

5
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,192
You're offering me
coffee in my own house?

6
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,675
Wise-ass fucker!
This is all mine!

7
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,677
Did you contribute anything?

8
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,239
Nothing.
-What?

9
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,234
I've contributed nothing.
- Fuck right! So fuck off then!

10
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,034
Don't wanna see you
anymore, got that?

11
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,239
When I get back, I want you
out of here. Got it?

12
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,677
Do whatever, go wherever,
I don't give a fuck!

13
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,837
Where's the car keys?

14
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,593
I'm selling it! Fuck it!

15
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,436
Again? -What! It's mine!
What the fuck is it to you?

16
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,269
Not a fuckin' thing!
-What was that?

17
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,034
Nothing.
-You are nothing!

18
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,272
Where d'you think you're going?
-May I go for a shit?

19
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,149
No. No way!

20
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,039
It's my can!
Go outside and shit!

21
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,515
What? It's my door!

22
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,790
You're taking the door?
- What the fuck is it to you!?

23
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,595
Move out!
Go to England, to Canada!

24
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,429
You've given up on this
country anyhow, the lot of you.

25
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,589
Fuckin' motherfucker.

26
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,476
It's you, neighbor.

27
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,074
Ah, madam, a lovely
day, isn't it.

28
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,197
Drunken bastard.

29
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,590
Fucking cow.

30
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,992
Fuck off with that door,
I worked the grave shift.

31
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,754
What fucking
work, motherfucker.

32
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,755
Good morning
uncle Joca.

33
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:46,750
Neighbor, what's up?
You don't let on...

34
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,351
Let me give you a hand.

35
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,510
You missed, you
redneck asshole!

36
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,837
Fuck you!

37
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,674
I gotta go, mom's
waiting for me.

38
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,515
Is Rasha home?

39
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,437
He's taking a shit
now, and then he'll fuck.

40
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,870
But too late, buddy.

41
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,229
It's stuffy in here,
should I open up?

42
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,079
Mom, how much
money is my pension?

43
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,313
Two thousand. Why do you ask?

44
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,190
I can buy 40 liters of milk.

45
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,990
Love, you can't even bring a
single pack from the store.

46
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,392
Don't get angry.

47
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,359
Can we throw away
money like that?

48
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,159
Where are you going?

49
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,833
I must walk, it's the medications.

50
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,515
I'll take it off your
pocket money. Ok?

51
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,878
Alright.

52
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,994
It's me, Ivan. Where are you?

53
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,840
In here. Have a seat,
I'm taking a shit.

54
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,590
In here. Have a seat,
I'm taking a shit.

55
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,273
Very well.

56
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,636
I can't.

57
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,997
I brought you the
book, remember?

58
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,835
'The Tale of Spiritual Life'
by Father Neil Sorski.

59
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,591
Want some coffee?
- Sure.

60
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,560
It's the book about
the eight sinful thoughts.

61
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,791
It's the book about
the eight sinful thoughts.

62
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,555
Eight?
- Yes.

63
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,674
Lust, anger, despair, pride,
greed for material things,

64
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,635
melancholy, vanity and extreme
appetite.That's eight.

65
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,233
He took the door.

66
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,280
I know, I gave him a hand.

67
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,838
I know, I gave him a hand.

68
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,031
Why'd they let him out of the
rehab if he's not well?

69
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,231
He's beyond help.

70
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,995
He must stop drinking.

71
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,520
He should read the book too. He
mustn't forget the Judgment Day.

72
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,432
He should read the book too. He
mustn't forget the Judgment Day.

73
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,750
He must ask the Good Lord...
- Fine, I'll read it.

74
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,798
You know...

75
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,240
...people don't
commit sins just like that.

76
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,437
...people don't
commit sins just like that.

77
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,997
The first step
is Suggestion...

78
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:21,916
...when a sinful
thought enters your head.

79
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,799
Persuasion.

80
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,950
Even the greatest
had to fight that.

81
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,471
Then, Consent, when
you wrestle these thoughts.

82
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,077
Then, Possession,

83
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,352
and then the most
horrible, fourth step...

84
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,074
Fuck school! I'll go later...

85
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:48,680
...to chill... a bit.

86
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,079
...to chill... a bit.

87
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,868
Ivan, this is Milla, my student.
- Pleased to meet you.

88
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,270
We were talking
about the fourth step

89
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,110
Of what?
- Of sinning.

90
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,919
Yes, Obsession.

91
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,400
Exquisite pleasure turned
into mere habit.

92
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,312
Exquisite pleasure turned
into mere habit.

93
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,834
You become a slave to sin.

94
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:18,073
You need strength and the Lord's
help to return to the path.

95
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,875
I have to go now.

96
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,640
Finish your coffee.

97
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,231
Finish your coffee.

98
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,318
I told Mom I wouldn't be long.

99
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,476
May I bring you a poem I wrote?

100
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,237
You don't have to read
it straight away. - OK.

101
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,472
You're all wet,
you little slut.

102
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,115
I am.
- Go ahead, take it!

103
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,190
Who's this guy?
What's that bullshit?

104
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,870
And what's this book?

105
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,080
Stay away from women, don't
speak with them or look at them.

106
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,833
Stay away from women, don't
speak with them or look at them.

107
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,594
A faggot book!
- Leave it.

108
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:15,119
Do we fuck first, or you
tell me about Hamlet?

109
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,993
I'd like to take a shit first.
- Go ahead.

110
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,435
I can't. Dad took the door off.

111
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,077
Here it is.

112
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,152
It's called 'Snail'

113
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,875
There must be someplace where
your Dad can get some help.

114
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,273
You want to put my old
man in a nuthouse?

115
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,919
She wants to know what it's like
inside a nuthouse. - No I don't!

116
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,520
Ivan's an expert.
Tell us about a typical day...

117
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,114
Ivan's an expert.
Tell us about a typical day...

118
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,675
...inside a nuthouse.

119
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,391
May I sit down?
- Of course.

120
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,669
The nurse presses a switch...

121
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:03,553
... and the light comes
on in the ward...

122
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,640
...every morning at 5:45 sharp.

123
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,350
Wake up! C'mon!

124
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,392
The same crap every day.

125
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,150
A crap buffet.
A buffet of crap.

126
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,838
Good job Ivan,
you're good with clay.

127
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,874
Why is the mouth so wide open?

128
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,114
Will you show us the sculpture?

129
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,880
If I find it, sure.

130
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,758
If I find it, sure.

131
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,154
I have to go now.

132
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:49,348
You just read the poem,
and tell me if it's any good.

133
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,476
Bottomline?

134
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:01,551
Even nuthouse cans have
doors on them! - Oh, fuck off.

135
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,239
Cool, ha?

136
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,509
Yeah.
- Could've done it yourself.

137
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:25,038
I guess.
- Now, take a shit. For my sake.

138
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,040
This is great!

139
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,519
This is great!

140
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,394
I couldn't focus out in the open.

141
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,319
Snail.

142
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,833
In the living room?
- No, it's Ivan's poem.

143
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,995
Read it out loud.

144
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,280
Wondrous creature, with
your home on your spine.

145
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,510
Wondrous creature, with
your home on your spine.

146
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,157
You slide through the
raindrop, cursed, alone!

147
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:57,348
Your home has room for you.
And only you.

148
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:02,031
And yet you hope someone comes
along to share in this and that,

149
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,000
Within the shell of your back,
A cup of coffee, or tea.

150
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,150
Within the shell of your back,
A cup of coffee, or tea.

151
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,755
It's phenomenal!
-The guy's a nutcase.

152
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,432
No he's not. Just a little
fucked up...

153
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,671
...but his systematic,
intelligent. His mom is crazy

154
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,353
You're so full of shit.

155
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,559
Not anymore.

156
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,309
What's he doing with that door?

157
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,518
Go wash yourself.
- What do you mean?

158
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,633
I mean wash it.
- Why?

159
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,994
I want to try you know what.

160
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,440
You want to kiss it.
-Yes!

161
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,158
You want to kiss it.
-Yes!

162
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,559
To stick it in your mouth.
- Yes!

163
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,630
Time is up.
- Eleven.

164
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,155
Five letters.
-Yes, 1 1, you're right.

165
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,954
I'll try an 8 letter word.
-Executioner.

166
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,634
Our computer found
an 1 1 letter word...

167
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,478
Where's your dad?

168
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,513
Your dad and I go a long
way back... - Sure.

169
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,120
Look. I'll give
you a 1 00... a 1 50.

170
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,394
Look. I'll give
you a 1 00... a 1 50.

171
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,313
If I find a buyer,
I'll give you more.

172
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:49,359
You can have this door
too, for 20 euros.

173
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,756
The door?
- It's a really great door.

174
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,840
I carried it all this way...
Fucking motherfucker.

175
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,352
I carried it all this way...
Fucking motherfucker.

176
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:04,118
C'mon. 20 euros, we close the
deal, and we go to celebrate.

177
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,677
Ok, ok, here you go.

178
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,396
Say hi to your old man for me.

179
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,549
It's great!

180
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,198
It's so cool when it starts to
get big in your mouth.

181
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,268
Was it good for you?
-Yeah.

182
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,280
Did other girls do it for you?
- Yeah.

183
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,915
Some guy blackmailied Anita:

184
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,510
'Can't fuck you unless
you blow me.'

185
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,752
Talk Hamlet, I'll touch myself.
- You're mad, you little slut.

186
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,520
Hamlet! Hamlet!

187
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,189
Hamlet was full of shit.
His own father fucked him up.

188
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,472
He wasn't getting any, got
into some serious drugs.

189
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,672
When he got high, his old
man's corpse came to him

190
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,430
On those trips, his old
man called for revenge.

191
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,240
So Hamlet was a jerk-off? - Yes,
and he got so hooked on that...

192
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,832
So Hamlet was a jerk-off? - Yes,
and he got so hooked on that...

193
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,794
...that he sold out
his kingdom for drugs!

194
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,393
Do you love me?

195
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,795
- No.

196
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,232
What's this?

197
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,749
You're getting a hard-on?
- Hardly.

198
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,754
Liar.
-Who are these guys?

199
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,232
Stick a finger in.
- I'll stick something else in.

200
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,348
Who's this?

201
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,920
These are my Mom and Dad.
Mom, Dad...

202
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,909
These are my Mom and Dad.
Mom, Dad...

203
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,511
...meet my Rasha.

204
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,433
Check these
invoices again.

205
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:23,756
Is something wrong? - I asked
you to check them, didn't I?

206
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,556
You left the box.

207
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,514
Dooshan.

208
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,115
Yes?

209
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,271
We're alone.

210
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,072
We are?

211
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:52,719
So, this is my work, and its
readers will have the final say

212
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,713
Historic ties between
the Slavs and the Germans?

213
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,434
It's close to
an idea of mine:

214
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,080
Both belong to the same tribe.
- I wouldn't go that far.

215
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,550
Both belong to the same tribe.
- I wouldn't go that far.

216
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,112
German eagle has one
head, Slavic eagle has two.

217
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,869
Germans fear the
Slavic mutant eagle.

218
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:16,191
The animosity between
them is a result of...

219
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:20,758
... Rationalism that Germans and
other western nations adopted.

220
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,393
An interesting theory.

221
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:27,116
To quote you: We are
children on Europe's playground.

222
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,040
But WE were here before
Europe existed!

223
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:35,549
It's a deadly playground, and
WE don't play by the rules.

224
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,995
And that is a fatal talent.

225
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,040
There's a huge problem
with your novel.

226
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,395
There's a huge problem
with your novel.

227
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,349
Yes? - It's overblown, and
way too politically correct.

228
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:53,999
You don't see that foreign rule
strenghtens a nation.

229
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:58,395
My book has nothing to do
with history, it's a love story.

230
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,316
Love between a man and
a woman bridging...

231
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,714
...the gap between
their two tribes.

232
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,231
Byzanthium ruined the Slavs!
No room for romance there!

233
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,871
Yes, well, that's your opinion.

234
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,480
Quick music break, and we will
return to today's novel...

235
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,230
Quick music break, and we will
return to today's novel...

236
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,595
'Prisoner of the Times'.
- Tribes!

237
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,956
...'Prisoner of the Tribes' and
our guest for today.

238
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,630
You write too?
Poetry, I presume?

239
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,914
Poetry's dead!
- Oh? When did it die?

240
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,796
Winter of 94.
It was all over the news.

241
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,750
Where is it buried?
- Everywhere!

242
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,469
Now you will read another
fragment from the novel.

243
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,358
Don't bother.

244
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,438
Where are you going?

245
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,600
I've heard enough insults, young
man. - Can't I have an opinion?

246
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,158
I've heard enough insults, young
man. - Can't I have an opinion?

247
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,352
I don't give a fuck about your
opinion... Jackass!

248
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,871
Write something first,
and then have an opinion.

249
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:42,557
Next week we continue the
tale of the fallen Slav tribe...

250
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,439
Maybe.

251
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,468
What are you doing
here, are you crazy?

252
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,556
The door was open,

253
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,152
I thought Rasha was home.

254
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,751
He's out.

255
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:29,873
I'll wait for him. It's
important, I need his help...

256
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,950
...I'm facing an
important decision.

257
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,477
Don't worry, I wouldn't look.

258
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,712
But you would fuck me?

259
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:07,555
I'm sorry. I made a mistake.
- The mistake was on my part.

260
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,434
What's another half
hour after 1 1 years?

261
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,750
Big guy, huh?
- Check me out!

262
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,232
Glasses?
- Contacts.

263
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,638
Your folks?
- They're fine.

264
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,279
So Ivan,

265
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,710
what's the important
decision then?

266
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,238
I write, you know.

267
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,831
Stories, and poems.

268
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,715
Rasha once told me they
were good so I kept writing.

269
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,468
I write every day. A
sentence or two.

270
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,115
Sometimes an entire paragraph

271
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,474
Rasha writes very well.
- Really?

272
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:13,110
He never showed you
his stories? - No.

273
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,714
They're dark. But excellent.

274
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:22,709
He used to write poems too.
Says they were no good.

275
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:27,634
I think that all
I have written so far...

276
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:35,472
...is really bad.
I've been thinking...

277
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,913
Thinking what?

278
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,156
I'll burn it all.
- Yeah?

279
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:46,559
Yes. Now I clearly see all the
flaws of my writing.

280
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:53,077
It's as if it's not my words...
- Listen Ivan,

281
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,077
I gotta go. You tell
him I'll be back later.

282
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,472
Why is he gone for so long?

283
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,112
Because... he is a SNAIL!

284
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:20,674
Are there any black guys over there?
- Of course there are.

285
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,717
Black girls too?

286
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,994
Hey! That's Rasha's dad!

287
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,278
Good afternoon uncle Joca.
- 'Afternoon.

288
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,278
Do I know you?

289
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,915
It's me. Doole.

290
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,989
Pozhoonac, pleased to
meet you. Retired alcoholic.

291
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,838
Can I give you a lift?
- To a store, perhaps.

292
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:54,434
I'm Igor, remember? Rasha and I
had a farewell party before the

293
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,839
Army. Even served together,
till he was transferred.

294
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,788
I live in England now.
- It's you son!

295
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,236
He was transferred to Slovenia.
Your dad saw that you weren't.

296
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:14,277
He was a bigger shot than I was.

297
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:18,390
Fuck, we had no clue
where Rasha was!

298
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,272
We waited for him.
The Slovenian terri...

299
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:31,599
Terri...Terrifuckers! Kept them
surrounded for two months.

300
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,991
So, you're in England?

301
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,912
Yes.
- Good for you.

302
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:14,790
In London? - No, near
Leeds? - Where exactly?

303
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:19,917
You know England well?
- Yorkshire, Lancashire...

304
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:25,597
I went there in the 60's with
some fuzzy commerce delegation,

305
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:29,556
to visit metal workers in Wales.

306
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,917
The English tried to sell us
some out of date technology.

307
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:39,553
Cunning, they were!

308
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,752
You're in Leeds?
- No. In Huddersfield.

309
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,309
Oodersfield, as
they say in Yorkshire.

310
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:52,356
England is a huge country.
- Not that huge really.

311
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,035
You're fucking with me?
- No.

312
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,111
It's not just what you see...

313
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:01,717
...what about the
islands, the colonies?

314
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:07,390
It's immense! Can't measure
the size of the fucking thing!

315
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,953
Oohh, neighbor!
What brings you here?

316
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:37,068
You're keeping an eye on
the place? You hungry? Thirsty?

317
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:42,155
Don't be scared.
- I'm waiting for Rasha...

318
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:47,517
Panties?! Did you
guys get some pussy?

319
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,999
Just you guys go ahead.
It's good for you!

320
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:59,311
You didn't get any? Your friend
fucked and left none for you?

321
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,556
He left you with the panties.
Did you smell them?

322
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,396
You want some brandy?

323
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,593
No thank you.
I'm on medication.

324
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,717
Screw medication!

325
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:16,431
Bring me my shot
glass, it's in the kitchen.

326
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,230
Here you are.
-Thank you.

327
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,878
If only my own son helped
me, like you did now...

328
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,874
If only he helped himself!

329
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,519
It's all gone to hell!

330
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:51,317
How's your Mom?
- She's fine, thanks.

331
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,070
Fine my ass. All alone with you.

332
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:57,557
She says you're bringing
whores in. - That's not true!

333
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,793
I know, I'm kidding!

334
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:06,037
I told her to find you a nice
lady and get you laid.

335
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:13,269
She took you around doctors...

336
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:18,990
...if she'd found you a whore,
you'd have been healed!

337
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:32,953
Look who's talking.Had I known
better, wouldn't live like this.

338
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:40,590
But you young generation...
You sold us out, you fuckers!

339
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,950
I gotta go now.

340
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,519
Go ahead neighbor.

341
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,320
Thanks for keeping an
eye on the place.

342
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,355
You are my only friend.
All the others are fuckers!

343
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,874
If I had you, I'd kill myself...

344
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:09,038
Maybe you're not
that crazy after all!

345
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:16,639
My wife gave birth to two idiots
and made another one - ME.

346
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:22,319
I gave her everything, and she
wasn't happy, motherfucker!

347
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:33,159
A nutcase is looking
after my home...

348
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,351
...my home has gone to hell...

349
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:44,757
...and he's taking care
of it. Nutcase.

350
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:15,357
Never done it to anyone I wasn't
in love with. - How did it feel?

351
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,475
I liked it that HE liked
it. You didn't forget, did you?

352
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:26,676
Watch out, it's real strong.
-There'll be plenty of us.

353
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:32,071
Ohh, a party! - Rasa's friend
visits after 1 1 years...

354
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,875
...in England.
- Fuck, 1 1 years!

355
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:41,759
Out of order? - Course it's out
of order, it ain't English!

356
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:45,675
This is Serbia! Healthy
living, loads of workout!

357
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,350
Who stuck this thing on here...

358
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,751
I'll stick my dick up his...

359
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:15,238
Did Rasa say when he'd be
back? We'll drop by later...

360
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:20,112
No! You sit down, eat,
drink, smoke... I'm off.

361
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:23,990
Gotta make my rounds, plenty of
drinking to be done!

362
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,115
'At Josa's', 'The Sweet Lamb',

363
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,032
'Banat' and 'The Dawn'.

364
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,552
Those are my homes!
Wanna come along?

365
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:37,156
No thank you. I'll
drop you off in my car.

366
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,719
I have a car. I sold it this
morning though...I think.

367
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,629
You wait here,
Rasha can't be far.

368
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,998
Whoever thought of that
curtain has a drink on me!

369
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:53,797
Where to?
-To 'The Dawn'!

370
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:31,275
See? A total mess! Pass it on...

371
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,877
Want some?
-No. Ok, maybe later.

372
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:45,755
Dad totally flipped when
they shut the plant down.

373
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:49,478
What about your mom
and sister? -Delirium.

374
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:54,517
Mom put up with him at first,
but left him 5 years ago.

375
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,234
She met a guy,
a bit older, well off.

376
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,916
My sister went
to live with them.

377
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,350
My brain is fried,
imagine how she feels.

378
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,272
Darling buds of May, huh...

379
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,992
Let daddy kiss to make
it better. Babes?

380
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,671
How old is she?

381
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:36,033
Old enough. High school. I help
her with a paper on 'Hamlet'.

382
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,153
When did you finish college?
- I didn't.

383
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:43,113
I never finished anything
I started. - Why not?

384
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,670
I haven't set foot out of
this shit-hole for five years.

385
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,350
I forgot where the college is...
- What do you live on?

386
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,550
Suffering... freelancing.

387
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,554
A column for the local paper,

388
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,431
Interviewing Belgrade
writers on the radio...

389
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,717
And you can live on that?
-See anyone 'living'?

390
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,911
You hit on kids, so...

391
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:09,034
No, pure fucking.
Porno 'Pygmalion'.

392
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,597
That's cool too.
- It's cool my ass.

393
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:22,312
And you? Gone for
1 1 years. Have a seat.

394
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:27,236
The place is fucked up, dad
takes something out every day.

395
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,790
He took the bathroom door today.

396
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,152
The freezer, the
bookcases, the heater...

397
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,913
And Doole? Looks like a yuppie
to me. What exactly does he do?

398
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:43,438
He bullshits! Runs a warehouse
for a guy selling Swiss candy.

399
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,154
He doubled in size.

400
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:48,113
It's money, right?
-Fuck money.

401
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:52,469
Comes weekend, he stays in bed
eating candy and watching TV.

402
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,752
He loves 'The Simpsons'.
- And you dont?

403
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,599
I don't have an
antenna, dad sold it.

404
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:07,111
I watch movies.
Porn and classics.

405
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,595
Russian fairytales.
- Russian fairytales?

406
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,993
The best trip! I sit on my own,
roll a joint and watch one!

407
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:22,596
Russians are crazy man! High
on mushrooms all the time!

408
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,959
That one...
- The underwater one?

409
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,396
No.
-The one who speaks backwards?

410
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:31,433
Kashchey!!
-He's a guru man!

411
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,955
Baby, you ok?

412
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,473
The Welshmen
were telling us

413
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:45,873
Don't buy that crap
from the English...

414
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:50,671
...it's shittiest crap ever!
Gotta trust the Welsh...

415
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:56,113
The English were screwing
them for centuries!

416
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:02,231
Swansea! We were in
Swansea... some machinery...

417
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,637
Welshmen!

418
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,195
Wonderful people, wonderful!

419
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:21,033
Not a sober minute between us...

420
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,036
I often thought of you.

421
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:30,030
Thought you were teaching
literature somewhere...

422
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,839
Maybe a book of poetry.
- Poetry?

423
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,994
You never published
the poems? - No.

424
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,039
Wanted to write a book on the
fall of the Slavic civilization.

425
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:46,239
On how none of the authentic
pagan rituals survived.

426
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,591
The Anglo-Saxons,
Celts, Normans, Aborigines

427
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:54,310
they all preserved their
deities, and the Slavs didn't.

428
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,479
Intriguing?

429
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,674
The publisher was on fire.
- And?

430
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,836
I was too lazy to write.

431
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,268
Let her sleep it off.
Hamlet is fucking hard.

432
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,758
You always took that to heart.

433
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,958
To heart my ass.
I only respect the...

434
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,152
...Pioneers' hat and scarf.
That was a good trip.

435
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:32,716
'We are all one army'. Would
she screw around and

436
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,718
smoke weed if she had
to make an oath?

437
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,150
As I become a Pioneer, I
solemnly declare I will defend -

438
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,551
Good timing!

439
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:44,832
You mixed it up, that's
the People's Army oath.

440
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:49,279
I served in the Yugoslav Army,
not the People's Army.

441
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:53,956
That's why you're such an idiot.
Your chief was Milosevic.

442
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:58,674
I served the people,
and you served Slobo!

443
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,953
So you're enemies now? - Yes, so
we can exterminate each other.

444
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,234
Who's the kid?
-The kid is God.

445
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:25,749
Hitting on kids again?
- I'm telling you, God put on

446
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:29,509
small tits and tiny ass, and
came to visit the mortals.

447
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,117
And a pretty god it is.
- Don't fuck around with God.

448
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,550
May I take a leak then?

449
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,197
Could you explain what this is?
- A curtain.

450
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,953
Where's the door?
- Doors are boring.

451
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:56,314
Lets' have some fun. - Easy for
you to say, you make hard money.

452
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,433
Wanna switch?
- What are you doing over there?

453
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:04,316
Taking a leak, what else?
You made me miss now...

454
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:08,553
I work as a lab
technician in a firm

455
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,751
testing chemicals.
-Great.

456
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,788
In Leeds? - I work in Leeds,
I live in Huddersfield

457
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:18,953
We'll move from Oodersfield, as
they say in Yorkshire, to Leeds.

458
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,471
You own a flat? A car?

459
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,870
I have a car, and I
rent an apartment

460
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,758
Got a girlfriend?

461
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,279
Fianc,e.

462
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:33,074
Her name is Ana, she's
Polish, a wonderful girl.

463
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:34,469
Catholic?

464
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,754
Jewish. If that matters at all.

465
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:43,229
We went to college together.
She's in grad school now.

466
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,156
Polish girls are so hot!

467
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,949
What do you know about
Polish girls? -They're pretty!

468
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:53,999
The 1 0 ? an hour Moldavians are
pretty for you. You don't screw.

469
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:58,352
Who doesn't screw? - You, pig,
you just jerk off and eat candy.

470
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:01,832
Your sperm is turning
into Swiss cheese...

471
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:05,436
When Doole screws,
he screws with discretion.

472
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,673
You've grown cobwebs on your
cock! - I fucked four hours ago.

473
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,837
For the first time?

474
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:16,508
I had some old broad. Not bad.
- The grandma took pity on you?

475
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:21,551
This broad's coming on to me
for a while. Smiling, winking.

476
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:25,639
Boring. You fucked a granny.
- She's 45. A real sex bomb.

477
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,674
Hail the king!
- King of the world!

478
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:32,028
I do the delivery, and I'm off.

479
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,835
Stay for coffee. Sure thing.
-Igor.

480
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,960
I take her to the basement...
- Iggy.

481
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:42,512
We're alone, she says. And I'm
like, you bet we are. - Igor!

482
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:48,033
You don't beleive me asshole!

483
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:51,471
What's Huddersfield like?

484
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,278
Doesn't matter. What
matters is I did get laid!

485
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:05,955
Working all the time. Trying
to keep in touch by e-mail.

486
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,598
You guys got e-mail?
- I do. At work.

487
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:13,471
I don't. Good job, Dad
would probably sell that too...

488
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,913
I'm getting married
next month.

489
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:24,117
Unreal. The guy's
planning months ahead.

490
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,590
That's how it is.
- No fucking way!

491
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,111
We can't count on being alive
next month. - Yes we can.

492
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,351
You better get used to it.

493
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:36,355
You're nuts. - We'll be like
the West, like England!

494
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:40,832
You think they'll come to your
door: 'Hello Mr. Nestle, here's

495
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:45,590
your Swiss bank account, your
stocks, you're a capitalist now'

496
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:49,759
Dream on! - The money's all
gone, and he sits there waiting.

497
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:52,110
I'm not waiting,
I'm slaving away.

498
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,517
Fucking grannies at lunchtime,
that's your progress!

499
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,354
Who the fuck are you
to talk like that?

500
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:02,309
You haven't lifted a finger in
5 years, you just spew shit...

501
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:05,194
...and hate everyone!
- I don't hate anyone.

502
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:09,672
He's fucked, Iggy. You're
33 and not a working day

503
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,549
in your life.
The new law is out.

504
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:18,118
If you want your pension, you'll
slave away till you're 90.

505
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,311
And untill then?
- What?

506
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:23,114
There will be no
pension, no nothing.

507
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:29,272
Wouldn't we all like to hang
out, talk crap and do nothing.

508
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:33,075
Tell him that the world's gone
to hell! Tell him how it is!

509
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:37,836
OK, the world has gone to hell,
but we can still drink to that!

510
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:53,790
Baby. Bathroom break?

511
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:10,194
I don't want you to fight now,
let's just chill. - Sorry.

512
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:16,075
I work a lot. I do my part, but
I don't like anyone riding me.

513
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,878
Why don't you help him?

514
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:32,918
Help him?
- Yes. His Dad's terrorizing him.

515
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:37,149
He should live on his own.
- He likes it.

516
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:41,191
He has this theory that
everything's 'falling apart'

517
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:45,793
so if everything IS falling
apart, it supports his theory.

518
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:48,270
So he's stuck.
-Exactly.

519
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:55,589
He had this fall-out with
his parents five years ago.

520
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,353
You know about that?

521
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,198
So, he got disappointed.

522
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,914
He had another disappointment.

523
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,072
You haven't heard?

524
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,758
He had a girlfriend.

525
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:14,673
For five years.

526
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:20,756
They lived together in Belgrade
while he was at the Uni.

527
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:26,632
He worked for a while, paid
the rent, saw it all through.

528
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,997
And? Nothing?
- Nothing!

529
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:31,996
The bubble burst, and so did he.

530
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,951
I really like those...

531
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:41,948
...Eurasian
cheek-bones of yours.

532
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:44,429
Very sexy.

533
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,991
I bet you're Mongolian...

534
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,357
Once upon a time, some
Mongol jumped your great-granny

535
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:59,112
and made a little Mongol and he
made your grandpa's grandpa.

536
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:03,509
And little by little, a hot
little Mongolian girl showed up

537
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:07,229
steaming all over the place.

538
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:13,711
Mongols will rise again, you
know! They'll fuck us all over,

539
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:17,351
...but they won't touch you,

540
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:22,555
When they see you, they'll say:
There's our little princess!

541
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,316
What does he want with this kid?

542
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:31,278
Don't have a clue!

543
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,557
Masochism.

544
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:38,317
He feels superior,
takes it out on kids.

545
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:42,758
Dumps one, finds another.
He's just making a mess.

546
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,309
Older women are cool.

547
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,955
Realistically speaking.

548
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,510
No strings attached.
- Hardly any strings anywhere.

549
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,796
Bullshit.
- No, it's not.

550
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:03,958
You're talking
shit. Shit. Shit.

551
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:08,713
Like his shit. 'People
can't see or hear anyone'.

552
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:13,709
Folks...

553
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,159
I love her.

554
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:21,472
We figured.

555
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,708
Kebabs are great.

556
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,470
I could use a bit of ketchup!
- Fucking ketchup.

557
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,952
Where were we?
- Middle row, first desk!

558
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,958
Radenovic. She married
a cop, has a kid.

559
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,158
Next to her...
- I know... Rasha what's her name?

560
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,960
I don't give a fuck
about the class morons.

561
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,274
Pavkovic Yasna!

562
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:03,717
Single, works for the city,
her dad fixed it.

563
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,911
She's a dog, she'll stay single.

564
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,113
Take it.

565
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:20,873
Then Vladan and Yaksic. Right?

566
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:23,237
Yaksic died in Kosovo.

567
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:25,154
No shit?

568
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:30,231
He was in an armored
unit. During the bombing.

569
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:35,519
I bumped into him, he pushes
his kid around in a stroller.

570
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:40,351
'Not at the front' I ask.
'I'll go back, we'll fuck NATO'.

571
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:45,668
And I'm thinking: 'If I had
a kid like that, I'd never go'.

572
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:49,118
Serbia is full of orphans.
Orphans and Kebabs.

573
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:53,189
Tough luck. They made
kebabs out of him!

574
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:00,239
Then...

575
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,229
Vladan.

576
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:06,474
Degree in IT, lives
in the States, works for IBM.

577
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,631
Behind them, Savic
and Stepanov.

578
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,231
Savic married a French
guy, lives in Paris

579
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,948
Stepanov sells fruit
at the market.

580
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:19,153
Krstic! Works with his dad,
designs business cards

581
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:22,199
and sells pirated
software. And Pinter?

582
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:25,274
He was inside for two years.
- Really?

583
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:28,508
'unlawful possession
of public property'.

584
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,509
Worked at a fish farm, had
a deal with the fishmongers.

585
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:36,070
Saw him on the market too,
selling stuff from Hungary.

586
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,880
There are worse things
than that. - What?

587
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,920
I said, there are worse
things than that.

588
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,159
Sure there are.

589
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:55,989
We're talking about
some people...

590
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,320
who went through the
same shit we did.

591
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:03,834
It doesn't really ring
any bells for you.

592
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:05,879
You weren't here.

593
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:18,508
Here...

594
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:29,598
What the fuck?

595
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:35,675
I'm asking you nicely:
What the fuck?

596
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:42,199
You fucked up my best
shirt you fucking moron!

597
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:48,039
Half of my month's pay!

598
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:52,192
I paid 70 Euros...

599
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,314
What the fuck are
you laughing at?

600
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:59,711
This will never come off!

601
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:01,349
Never!

602
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:04,031
Wait, he didn't mean it!

603
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:14,278
What are you laughing at?
This will never come off!

604
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:20,839
I'll tell you some
kindergarten jokes later.

605
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:37,359
You dickhead!

606
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,631
Awfully funny.

607
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,270
Shutup! Shutup!
Shutup!

608
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:16,151
We're listening to this song
five times in a row!

609
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:22,592
And we'll hear it for
another five times.

610
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,318
C'mon! Be a man!

611
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:33,634
Do you really live in England?

612
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,560
I really do.
- Horrible.

613
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:45,279
At a closer look, you do look
like an Englishman.

614
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:52,195
Why did you come back?
- I'm from here.

615
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,079
Yes Mom?

616
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:19,471
Why aren't you answering?

617
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:22,271
I was reading a book.

618
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,516
You hear this?

619
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:28,236
You won't be able to sleep
because of these junkies!

620
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:32,155
Go upstairs and tell them
to quiet down. Ok? - Ok.

621
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:49,636
Hey Ivan.

622
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:55,479
Ivan. Poet. Genius. What's up?

623
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:58,754
Mom sends me.
- What for?

624
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:03,075
She says to turn down the music.
- Say hi to Mom from me.

625
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:08,269
What are you up to?
- Reading something.

626
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:11,231
Wanna chill with us?

627
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:15,872
I don't know. - Tell mom we'll
quiet down and come back. Ok?

628
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:18,908
Alright.

629
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:23,791
What fucking chill-out?
- What's with this guy?

630
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:27,153
You don't remember Ivan?
- Where from?

631
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:30,836
From high-school. The judoist.
- He lost 20 kilos.

632
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:34,437
That guy?!
-Tell me his not coming!

633
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:38,036
That's our high-school buddy.
- What happened to him?

634
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:42,473
He's gonna tell you. - Guys like
him don't talk to strangers.

635
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:45,638
I'll introduce you.
We'll have some fun!

636
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:48,633
Roll one honey, we'll go crazy!
- Crazy huh?

637
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:52,270
I'm looking for a donor,
to print his book of poetry

638
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,560
I can't believe it.
- What?

639
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:58,035
I'm craving some sweets.

640
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:03,676
Me too. Go get us some wafers.
- I'll miss the beginning.

641
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:05,837
Go get it!
-Ok, I'll go.

642
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:16,432
Where are you going?

643
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:23,034
Rasha has some friends
over, they invited me too.

644
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:27,118
They invited you?

645
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,118
They invited me.

646
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,711
Half'n hour. Ok?

647
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:55,839
C'mon in.

648
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:06,029
You've met Milla.

649
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:09,996
And this is Igor.

650
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:20,032
Want a kebab?
-No thank you.

651
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:23,075
Want some weed?
- No.

652
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,036
Want some ketchup?

653
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:30,677
There's none left,
it's all on me...

654
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:33,349
What did you do?

655
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:37,716
Weed?
-No, I can't, you know that.

656
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:40,395
Ok, no weed for you.

657
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:46,551
Igor wants to make a donation
for the publishing of your book.

658
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:52,511
I told him your poetry was great,
he accepted, it's a done deal.

659
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:54,559
Really?
-Sure.

660
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:56,997
There is one condition.

661
00:59:57,840 --> 01:00:00,354
We are serious people.

662
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:05,318
Tell him about your case, how
you developed your fears.

663
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:08,475
Tell him about that?

664
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:12,229
Everything you told me,
the treatment, your interests.

665
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:16,393
Everything?
- Everything.

666
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:20,753
Ivan gets tired fast.
Skip a little...

667
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:24,193
...and I'll help you. Ok?
-Ok.

668
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,150
When did it all begin?

669
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:32,758
I was 1 3 at the time.

670
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,514
I was standing on the balcony.

671
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:42,069
It was the month of May,
a really hot afternoon.

672
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:45,753
Dad was still living with us.

673
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:48,192
Suddenly...

674
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,036
...I felt scared.

675
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:55,878
The line between reality and
fantasy got blurred.

676
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:59,551
Fantasy flamed up.
- You were afraid of heights?

677
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:02,035
Yes, heights too, but...

678
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:05,955
...it was an inexplicable fear.

679
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:11,678
I was in cold sweat,
Mom carried me inside.

680
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:15,034
I was recovering
for several days.

681
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:20,309
At the time, I read medical
encyclopedias, loads of stuff.

682
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:24,548
One could say you exaggerated.
- Yes. Yes.

683
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:28,594
Then I felt the fear
of sharp objects...

684
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:32,117
...and open spaces.

685
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:35,393
How old were you?
- Sixteen.

686
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,795
You started to study Yoga books?

687
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:42,757
Yes. At 1 7 there came the
fear of madness.

688
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:48,557
I was thorough with Yoga, I'd
read every book available.

689
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:51,678
You had a Yoga instructor?
-Yes.

690
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:56,790
Breathing and Yoga...

691
01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:00,359
...relieved some of the fears.

692
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:04,796
Soon it was the 1 8th birthday.

693
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:08,918
I felt the fear of women.

694
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:13,596
I desired their company...

695
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:16,798
...but the fear of them
was much stronger.

696
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:18,878
What happened next?

697
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:21,395
All of a sudden the
fears disappeared.

698
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:25,719
I began to practice
the occult, Kabala.

699
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:31,515
I was carrying out exercises
with imaginary objects in space.

700
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:36,157
As a Judoist, I had no problem
with Yoga and Kabala.

701
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:39,950
I knew my body, I
was strong, flexible.

702
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:42,039
And black magic?

703
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:43,515
No!

704
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:52,078
I only knew some people
who did rituals...

705
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:55,630
...with the inverted pentagram,
I never did that myself.

706
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:58,556
Who did that?
- I told you before.

707
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:01,234
It was your Yoga instructor?
- Goran.

708
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:04,711
During one of our
sessions, I noticed...

709
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:07,678
...a drawing in the room.
- Where exactly?

710
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:12,073
It was drawn on the
floor, very skillfully,

711
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:15,670
almost invisible, if
you don't look closer.

712
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:21,155
Inverted pentagram. - And
what did he try to do to you?

713
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:24,953
He tried to stick larvae to
my Aura. - Larvae?

714
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:27,390
I told you that before.

715
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:33,516
Larvae of negative energy,
people create them...

716
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:36,877
in order to stick them
to other peoples Aura's.

717
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:41,511
They penetrate your Aura, and
suck the good energy out.

718
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:44,156
But only if you are weak!

719
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:49,514
If you're strong, they can't do
it, and they fall off and die,

720
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:53,232
or move to someone else,

721
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:56,154
and suck energy to survive!

722
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:07,952
Then I went to the Army.
- And before that?

723
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:11,552
I don't know.
- When you fought 1 0 cops?

724
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:14,998
I'd rather not talk about that.
- I will then!

725
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:19,119
He barged in to a secret
ritual of the Free Masons.

726
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:22,394
Police stopped you, using force.

727
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:27,197
I located their meeting place,
and I wanted to expose them.

728
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:30,034
What was the place?
- A high-school.

729
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:32,629
Which one?
- I'd rather not say.

730
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:37,515
Ok, you won't tell us, maybe
it was our school.

731
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,829
What did I miss?
- A lot. Give me the wafers.

732
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:47,717
C'mon.
- Go ahead.

733
01:04:58,080 --> 01:04:59,559
This is nougat.

734
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:04,708
You can't tell the difference.
You'll never get into Nestle!

735
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:08,719
Cashier was a granny? She could
have sold you a pile of shit.

736
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:12,555
These are fine. - I'll stick a
wafer in your fucking pocket,

737
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:15,393
to teach you the difference!
Wafers are black!

738
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:18,273
Cut the crap. What did I miss?

739
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:22,070
Sorry Ivan, please carry on.

740
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:26,873
Doole the granny-fucker, he
can't tell nougat from wafers.

741
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:29,510
Go on. You went to the Army?

742
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:34,271
In the Army my
condition deteriorated.

743
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:38,839
My training was very hard.
- Special forces?

744
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:44,189
I was real good at Judo,
weighed 20 kilos more than now.

745
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:48,991
How long did you manage? - The
training and another two months.

746
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:56,191
Then the insomnia started,
I couldn't communicate.

747
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:03,310
They sent me to Belgrade for
treatment, I was discharged.

748
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:09,278
The medications did not
let me read, or think.

749
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:14,316
My muscles weakened.

750
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:23,554
I'm getting tired,
may I sit down?

751
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:26,037
Of course, go ahead.

752
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:30,279
Wanna beer?
- Coffee please.

753
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:34,189
Baby, make some coffee.
- What?

754
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:38,799
Ivan wants some coffee.
- So that's it, huh?

755
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:43,557
Move your ass, be useful.
-Why don't you be of use to us?

756
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:45,671
How?

757
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:48,236
Fuck off, that's how!

758
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:51,391
Instead of fucking him up.

759
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:56,517
Ah, a sweet little teenage shit
is just a perfect topper...

760
01:06:57,240 --> 01:07:00,596
To the pile
of shit I live under.

761
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:09,912
Sorry, Ivan. Which medication?

762
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:12,079
Medication...

763
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:17,116
'Meleryl'
suppresses sexual desire.

764
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:20,553
That's for Doole, to
stop his granny hopping.

765
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:28,589
'Leogenretard'
for 'calm and collected thinking'

766
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:30,712
That one's for Rasha!

767
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:39,714
At 1 9 I was back at
the hospital again.

768
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:43,589
I was told to stay
away from books.

769
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:47,994
No Yoga, Kabala, the Tree
of life, Tarot, nothing!

770
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:52,479
For seven, no, eight years...

771
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:56,035
...I was on 407mg a day.

772
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:59,680
They reduced that later.

773
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:02,158
This is sad, sorry man.

774
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:06,875
They ruined the guy.
- 407mg, they should be put away.

775
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:11,872
They should've given him a
whore at 1 7. -Or a granny.

776
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:21,029
Sorry Ivan, the weed is fucking
us up, we can't control it.

777
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:27,678
It's not funny, sorry.

778
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:34,557
I'll piss myself!

779
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,638
Here you go.
- Thank you.

780
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:46,316
He'll be OK once
he's had the coffee!

781
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:51,873
He'll be born again!

782
01:08:58,440 --> 01:08:59,873
Eight years...

783
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:04,838
He's embarrassed.

784
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:09,756
For eight years...

785
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:13,919
... I lived primarily
with the notion

786
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:18,872
that the essence of life

787
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:23,355
and understanding the World

788
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:27,671
was the idea of reincarnation.
- Fuck.

789
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:29,868
For three years

790
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:34,671
I worked at the iron-foundry
as manual labor.

791
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:38,515
I suffered a serious injury.

792
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:43,710
A part of my hip was removed.

793
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:47,553
I'm on disability pension since.

794
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:51,555
I'm 33.

795
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:55,149
I live with my mother now.

796
01:09:57,320 --> 01:10:01,313
Three years ago I was baptized
in the Orthodox Church.

797
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:05,593
Nowadays...

798
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:10,476
I take only 5mg
of 'Haloperidol'

799
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:14,277
for psychosis.

800
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:18,034
and 'Artan' 5mg

801
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:20,671
for prevention of seizures.

802
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:25,913
I like to walk.

803
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:30,835
I have one friend.

804
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:36,512
I walk to his home
and back every day.

805
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:42,079
That's me.

806
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:47,159
And you, Rasha,

807
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:51,397
you should keep
that book I gave you.

808
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:54,274
Neil Sorsky?
- Yes.

809
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:56,991
What does father Neil say?

810
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:02,836
Saint Anthony the great says:

811
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:05,039
Deep down

812
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:11,273
we should believe that we won't
live till the end of today.

813
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:21,548
Isn't he a genius?

814
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,638
Father Ivan the great.

815
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:29,553
A yogin, an alchemist,
a kabalist.

816
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:34,112
You see how difficult
the path to true faith is?

817
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:38,359
What kind of shit one has to go
through. 407mg a day for years.

818
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:43,599
After all that, you talk
directly to God Almighty!

819
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:46,950
Where has this man got to?

820
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:51,549
Nowhere.

821
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:55,917
Destroyed mentally
and physically.

822
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,070
But writes some good poetry.

823
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:06,953
I'm kidding.

824
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:13,033
You can stick your
God in your pocket.

825
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:16,271
Let's show them your God.

826
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:19,633
I'll do it.

827
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:24,959
Here it is!

828
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:31,069
Haloperidol, nice
name for a God?

829
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:34,110
Hello, hello there,
I am your God!

830
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:37,792
What's he like?
Round, small, porous.

831
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:40,470
He may be small,
but he's your God!

832
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:47,997
Take your God, your Savior.

833
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:52,320
It's all so fucking simple.

834
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:10,674
What? Are we having fun yet?

835
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:13,033
You fucked him up.

836
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:14,639
He's my buddy.

837
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:20,356
You fucked him up real bad,
what kind of shit was that?

838
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:22,551
What the fuck is wrong with you?

839
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:26,110
I look after him every day.
I pull him out of his shit.

840
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:30,712
It took you half'n hour to fall
for it. He's possessive, bugs

841
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:34,635
me every day. His mother doesn't
talk to him as much as I do!

842
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:39,590
Tommorow he'll be back with
more. 'Importance of prayer.'

843
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:42,752
'Demons envy the
earnest praying man'.

844
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:46,829
I don't give a fuck about him.
Now I've fucked you up.

845
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:53,070
You stinkers.
- Cut the crap.

846
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,834
I give my Pioneers'
word of honor!

847
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,513
Go get me a beer.

848
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:10,635
Go get me a beer, I'll see
you again in 1 1 years.

849
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:15,311
Baby!

850
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:19,634
Let's put the tape on,
to get us going.

851
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:21,075
What tape?

852
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:25,114
Home fucking video baby.
- Are you crazy, you asshole!

853
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:27,636
Wait, these are my friends.

854
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:32,077
What's this? Fucking...

855
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:38,235
I know this guy!

856
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:40,148
And the old lady?

857
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:42,954
Her too.

858
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:47,269
Small town on the prairie.
Everyone knows everything.

859
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:51,116
It's that lawyer and his wife.

860
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:53,669
You fucked the granny?
- No.

861
01:14:58,160 --> 01:14:59,593
You cunt!

862
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:03,079
You stinking motherfucker!

863
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:15,916
Her Dad, and her Mom.

864
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:18,517
Who?

865
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:26,589
Why did you put it
on? What's wrong with you?

866
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:31,191
You're sick. I'm leaving.
- Yeah?

867
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:35,791
You're only moral till some
granny grabs your balls.

868
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:39,350
I've had enough,
I'm getting sick!

869
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:41,991
We're all sick...

870
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:45,829
Where the fuck do you get
off with all this pontification?

871
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:50,591
You never did anything with your
life, you just shit on people!

872
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:54,628
Go figure yourself out, man!
You're your own worst enemy!

873
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:59,470
At least I managed to
draw your attention.

874
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:03,230
I already know all that shit
about people's attention span!

875
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:05,915
How long you've lasted
listening to me!

876
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:08,992
Nobody listens to anybody,
nobody sees anyone...

877
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:12,078
...it's all just blips and
dots and fragments!

878
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:17,593
You think this conversation has
a point? -Probably not. I'm off.

879
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:20,189
You're off. Where to?

880
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:22,272
I don't give a fuck!

881
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:25,598
Who cares what the
fuck we talked about!

882
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:29,470
You think I care what he
did in Yorkshire for 1 1 years!

883
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:32,075
If he's fucking the
Polish girl or not.

884
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:33,719
You're right, it's OK.

885
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:37,751
We are zeros! Dickheads!

886
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:41,190
If we took 407mg...

887
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:45,194
... we wouldn't know who we are
in a couple of years!

888
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:54,119
Wait.

889
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:59,035
That's not my shirt anymore!

890
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:10,119
I can't listen to you any longer.

891
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:14,072
...and I'm sorry
we part like this.

892
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:16,276
Pathos. Of the worst kind!

893
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:19,151
I'm tired.

894
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:23,839
I work tomorrow.

895
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:27,518
Igor...

896
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:31,398
...I'll see you around.

897
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:55,391
It seems we overdid it tonight.

898
01:17:56,680 --> 01:17:59,069
Once every 1 1
years. Quite enough.

899
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:01,840
How did the time pass for you?
- Fast.

900
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:05,630
But I managed to
get a lot of things done.

901
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:07,474
And for you?

902
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:11,514
Fast, but I haven't
got anything done.

903
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:16,753
I didn't know, Doole told me
about this girlfriend of yours.

904
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:21,878
Five years...

905
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:26,949
Seven months... and 22 days.

906
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:32,032
If only you knew how
much I built into that.

907
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:34,911
My love was a cathedral.

908
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:39,639
Now it's the
prettiest ruin around.

909
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:44,031
I could turn it into
a tourist attraction.

910
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:47,519
I go to sleep with it,
I wake up with it.

911
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:53,355
Doesn't go away.

912
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:08,153
You know what really fascinated
me in Huddersfield? A lion.

913
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:12,714
As in an animal?
- No. A sculpture.

914
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:18,993
A big, white, stone lion.
It looked so familiar.

915
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:23,675
Cheered you up? - It did. It
reminded me of our Town Park.

916
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:29,029
Is that stone lion still
there? The sleeping one?

917
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:30,554
It's there.

918
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:45,913
Remember how we liked to ride
it as kids? I have a photo.

919
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:50,753
I also have it. The yellow stone
lion sleeps, I ride on his back.

920
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:08,512
The one over there is white,
and this one is yellow.

921
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:14,750
What's your problem?

922
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:18,196
The cathedral is
ruined, so what?

923
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:22,519
You said it: Doors are boring.
Cathedrals are boring too.

924
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:26,071
Cheer up, live a little!
Come visit me.

925
01:20:27,680 --> 01:20:29,830
Catch a plane, and come visit.

926
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:39,320
How lonely you think I
felt in the past 1 1 years?

927
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:45,711
Walked around,peeked through the
windows, watched people live.

928
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:50,111
I didn't hate them.

929
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:54,671
I only envied them.

930
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:03,038
Everything I do
is trying to make a home.

931
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:08,152
Over there, here,
doesn't matter.

932
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:13,072
Anywhere.

933
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:17,311
See this?

934
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:20,758
A thousand dinars,
bus fare to her.

935
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:25,396
I'm keeping it.

936
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:29,158
Stupid. But I keep it.

937
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:33,876
It's late.

938
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:36,994
I'm fading. I'm tired.

939
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:42,590
That's the only good thing that
bastard Hamlet thought of.

940
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:45,430
It's almost a patriotic act.

941
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:49,316
I forgot to tell her why he
brought Fortinbras over.

942
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:53,637
That's what we need. The
Turks! The Mongols! Whoever!

943
01:21:55,680 --> 01:21:58,752
Foreign rule would
strengthen our unity.

944
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:03,512
We could hate them!

945
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:08,751
It's good for spiritual life.

946
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:13,110
Good for the birth rate!

947
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:19,156
That's important shit.

948
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:26,993
Our lion is yellow because we
piss all over what we've got.

949
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:12,671
I've tried to help you.

950
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:17,835
I've tried everything.

951
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:21,516
Unlike you,

952
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:24,550
I never did it insincerely...

953
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:28,428
or with the intention
of insulting you.

954
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:32,549
You have lied to me...

955
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:36,911
...and you have insulted me.

956
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:42,589
Last night was difficult for me.

957
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:47,111
Very difficult.

958
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:50,348
I've burnt all my manuscripts.

959
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:53,030
They weren't the real me.

960
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:58,313
You stirred up my imagination,

961
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:02,313
approved of my weaknesses...

962
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:08,078
...and envied my true faith
and spiritual peace.

963
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:10,793
Who's that?

964
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:13,829
Your judge.
- Ivan, is that you?

965
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:16,032
Prepare to face the truth.

966
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:17,834
What the fuck...

967
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:39,153
I know you can hear me.
I know you're not sleeping.

968
01:24:44,840 --> 01:24:48,799
A demon needs
neither sleep nor rest.

969
01:24:49,560 --> 01:24:51,516
God forgive me.

970
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:16,832
Wake up!

971
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:23,879
Motherfuckers!
Who did this to you?

972
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:26,118
C'mon son!

973
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:28,994
Motherfuckers!

974
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:31,870
Who did this to you?

975
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:35,872
What dad, what!

976
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:38,711
You're covered in blood.

977
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:44,078
It's ketchup dad.
- What?

978
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:46,159
Ketchup, ketchup.

979
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:53,151
Motherfucker! You wanna kill me?

980
01:25:53,480 --> 01:25:55,152
You want me dead?

981
01:25:56,440 --> 01:26:00,319
I'm calling the police! I'll
tell them you want to kill me.

982
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:05,556
They'll put you in the hole.

983
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:09,795
I'll so report you!

984
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:13,714
Police! Police!

985
01:26:40,440 --> 01:26:42,317
Rasha. It's me.

986
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:47,791
There you are.

987
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:53,878
I have to tell you something.

988
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:59,519
I've been thinking, you see.

989
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:11,517
I'll never find a girlfriend.

990
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:16,389
I mean, I'll never
have kids, a family of my own.

991
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:25,392
I like your girlfriend.

992
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:29,152
She's so pretty. Very pretty.

993
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:34,197
And you are a smart young man.

994
01:27:35,480 --> 01:27:36,993
Handsome too.

995
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:43,515
You deserve to have somebody.

996
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:49,353
Everybody needs somebody.

997
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:56,637
And if I did something
wrong last night...

998
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:03,518
I wanted to apologize
to you and your friends.

999
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:06,472
And to your girlfriend.

1000
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:10,233
Milla. Right?

1001
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:14,396
Milla.
- Milla.

1002
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:19,035
Please give them
my sincere apologies.

1003
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:26,836
I've fucked up everything.

1004
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:33,833
What's the matter?

1005
01:28:40,040 --> 01:28:43,635
You probably wanted to be
alone, I barged in like this.

1006
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:46,548
Wait.

1007
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:53,111
I dreamt of you last night...

1008
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:56,791
You dreamt of me?

1009
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:02,391
I'm sorry, Ivan...

1010
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:07,637
Forgive me man.

1011
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:10,070
What's the matter?

1012
01:29:10,840 --> 01:29:12,910
I fucked everything up.

1013
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:15,238
What's with you?

1014
01:29:18,120 --> 01:29:20,998
Shall I bring you
something to calm down?

1015
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:25,636
Don't...

1016
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:35,192
Sometimes it's best
to have a good cry.

1017
01:29:36,160 --> 01:29:39,038
Go on.. I'm here, don't worry...

1018
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:41,153
I'll be here.

1019
01:29:44,840 --> 01:29:46,831
Look what I brought you.

1020
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:53,510
Look. My masterpiece.

1021
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:56,197
I found it.

1022
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:03,315
You made this?

1023
01:30:05,680 --> 01:30:09,878
Isn't it obvious? The ugliest
thing I've ever seen.

1024
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:15,075
What is it?

1025
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:20,557
I wanted to make a
portrait of my mother

1026
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:25,150
But as you see
it doesn't look like her.

1027
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:30,799
My teacher suggested
I name it 'Fatherland'.

1028
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:36,837
So, to bring the two together
I named it 'Mother-Fatherland'.

1029
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:41,796
It's not bad at all!

1030
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:48,036
Why is her mouth so wide open?

1031
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:53,115
She's shouting. Admonishing.

1032
01:30:54,640 --> 01:30:58,030
Warning. And she's in pain.

1033
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:03,557
If you like it...

1034
01:31:04,720 --> 01:31:06,711
...it's a gift from me.

1035
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:14,472
I like it.

1036
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:20,035
I really like it.

1037
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:27,632
Good. Would you like
a nice cup of coffee?

1038
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:31,309
No.... You sit down,
I'll make it.

1039
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:44,550
Your father mentioned the
police. Are they coming for you?

1040
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:51,392
Coffee...

1041
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:54,472
...or tea?

1042
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:01,078
Tea.

1043
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:09,315
Listen, if they come...

1044
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:13,316
...you'll defend me.

1045
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:17,078
I will.

1046
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:19,591
You will?
- I will.

1047
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:23,036
That poem is great, man.

1048
01:32:23,320 --> 01:32:25,276
'Snail'?
- 'Snail'.

1049
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:28,672
And you like the sculpture
too, you said so.

1050
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:33,911
Mother - Fatherland
- Mother - Fatherland.

1051
01:32:48,920 --> 01:32:51,832
Tea?
-Tea.
