00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:12,280
KLARA

2
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:26,359
FOR CHIARA FRUGONI

3
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:27,080
- When will we get there?
- It's almost there, Pacifica.

4
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:31,719
You said so earlier.
I'm beat and hungry as a wolf.

5
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:36,680
- What was it?
- How do I know?

6
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,840
- Wolf?
- You about that wolf again!

7
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:43,319
- What if...
- What?

8
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,759
If it's the devil?

9
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,360
The clothing bites me.

10
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:26,959
Pacifica, do you have any doubts?

11
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,759
- Do you want to go home?
- Don't.

12
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:32,600
I'm with you.

13
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:39,480
Francis.

14
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,759
We are ready.

15
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:55,160
I, Clare, vow to observe
the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ

16
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,680
And live in obedience,
poverty and chastity.

17
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,959
I, Pacifica, vow to observe
the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ

18
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,079
And live in obedience,
poverty and chastity.

19
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:14,839
As our Lord said to the apostles:

20
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,040
don't take anything on the road.

21
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,839
Neither cane nor bag.

22
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:23,160
Neither sandals nor money.

23
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,399
Promise to follow
Christ's example.

24
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,639
Who said
to the seeker of perfection:

25
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,120
"If you want to be perfect,
sell what you own

26
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,879
And distribute to the poor.

27
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:45,639
And follow me."

28
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,199
We promise.

29
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,079
Today was a holiday and there was a whole hen!

30
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,600
Delicious!

31
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:24,600
Did you know that we have a name in common?

32
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,519
What?

33
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,639
I'm Pacifica and you're Pacifica.

34
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:34,959
Pass the bread.

35
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,079
Take bread.

36
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,759
Take.

37
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:51,240
We will eat together.

38
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,839
You can't stay here.

39
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,000
Why?

40
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,040
Because your relatives will come
And they will take you home.

41
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:12,279
And what are we going to do?
There's nothing we can do.

42
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,560
- We cut our hair.
- That's not enough.

43
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:19,360
- Only the monastery will protect you.
- Go to St. Paul's.

44
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:22,480
- I don't want to.
- They will make servants of us.

45
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:25,680
This is how they treat those without a dowry.

46
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,600
Just for a few days.
Then we will take you to St. Damian.

47
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,440
You will be with your sisters from the service.

48
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,639
You have to minister,
since you don't have dowries.

49
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,320
The kitchen needs to be taken care of,

50
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:50,519
Clean it from dirt and dust,
As well as clean the entire house.

51
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,799
We are servants of the Lord,
We have peaceful souls.

52
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:55,120
Probably.

53
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:00,919
Put sandals on your feet.
I don't want dirt in my convention.

54
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:06,080
There was one thing,
that Father Benedict wanted,

55
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:09,039
and which he was not given the opportunity to receive.

56
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,240
He had a sister named Scholastica....

57
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,679
This is a story about Scholastica,

58
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:17,440
sister of our patron saint
St. Benedict.

59
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:25,159
- Do you understand Latin?
- Yes.

60
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,759
I was taught by a grammar master.

61
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,759
I am a widow without a dowry,
I came here with my sister.

62
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,559
We are servants, but nobles.

63
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:38,879
- I even have an adult son.
- Do you?

64
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:43,039
But he left me.
He is traveling the world.

65
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,639
Sister Bentevenga fell asleep.

66
00:09:56,919 --> 00:10:00,000
Francis should teach
In our language,

67
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,559
bring the Bible closer to those unfamiliar with Latin.

68
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:04,279
Francis is right.

69
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:09,559
But the Bible must not be translated
into our language. That would be a sin.

70
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:16,440
Listen to how beautiful it is.

71
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,360
Benedict visits Scholastica.

72
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,080
She asks him to stay the night,
because she doesn't want to be alone,

73
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:25,080
But Benedict can't.

74
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:28,799
She must return to the convent.
Scholastica cries.

75
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:33,320
She cries so much,
That her tears cause torrential rain.

76
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:37,720
And Benedict and his confreres
are not allowed to go outside.

77
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,600
Divine goodness.

78
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,759
...raised her head from the table

79
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,240
And a thunderstorm broke loose,

80
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,679
Accompanied by heavy rain.

81
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:52,600
And the saintly Benedict

82
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:55,840
and the confreres who are with him

83
00:10:55,919 --> 00:11:00,960
They could not even foot
step outside...

84
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,039
Klara!

85
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:44,039
Klara!

86
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,519
Get out!

87
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:49,120
Favarone's daughter!

88
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:51,879
Get out, woman!

89
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,840
Come out and show them your head.
They can't do anything to you.

90
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:02,840
Favarone's daughter!
Woman of shamelessness!

91
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,279
You have to go home,

92
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,519
Under the authority of his father.

93
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:31,440
Your hair?

94
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,600
- What did you do?
- I cut them down.

95
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,600
Now what?

96
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,519
Would you like to be on duty with these nuns?

97
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:45,960
Why?

98
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:48,840
No, father.

99
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:52,279
I want to be with Francis and his brothers.

100
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,840
I want to live in poverty.

101
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:56,639
And when they look at me

102
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,120
This they look at and say

103
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,639
That I am too bold

104
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,799
However, I cannot tear my eyes away
and stop staring

105
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:15,159
Because when you look at me,
I'm already waiting to be with you

106
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:19,919
So that you believe in me and love me wholeheartedly

107
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,120
But I see someone else

108
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,919
May the fires of hell consume him

109
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,720
Because I think to myself,
That he is jealous of me

110
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:31,960
But I don't want to be sad

111
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:36,159
He must not look at me

112
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,840
He is wasting his time and I will get away from him

113
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,639
You are pulling the thread....

114
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,919
you press the pedal...

115
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,399
And then the shy...

116
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,879
- And it's falling down.
- Can we too?

117
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,279
- Yes.
- Cristina, start, I'll watch.

118
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,519
- I rewind the thread.
- Yes.

119
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:53,480
And I'm dragging...

120
00:15:57,159 --> 00:16:00,039
- Did you find them?
- We can keep them.

121
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,440
Take a look at these.

122
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,120
Small.

123
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,360
They are big and small. For every foot.

124
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,399
Elijah...

125
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,279
Footwear.

126
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,159
Destroyed, but can be repaired.

127
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,600
We'll try it on.

128
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,440
Our brothers go barefoot.

129
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:24,039
We will put them on, going to the lepers.
We go barefoot in the monastery.

130
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,440
Francis agrees.

131
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,000
These are nice.

132
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:31,000
Ms. Klara?

133
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:35,720
Yes, sister?

134
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:38,159
Through the love of
Our Lord Jesus Christ

135
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:40,559
heal my child.

136
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,279
I am not a medic.

137
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,879
He has been in a fever for three days.

138
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:50,320
Help me, please.

139
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:19,279
- I think it's better with him.
- Heat is the best medicine.

140
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:26,319
What will we do when you start healing?
There will be no room for newcomers.

141
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,759
We will open a hospice
For those in need.

142
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:32,480
- We have enough room to sleep.
- For now.

143
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,519
And how will the new sisters arrive?

144
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,160
Really? Do you think they will be different?

145
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,519
I think so.

146
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,799
For me, the brothers of the forest are like knights.

147
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:00,160
Those from King Arthur's Round Table.

148
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,960
Now you also have sisters.

149
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:07,440
Faithful and courageous.

150
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,559
But you have to talk
with the Holy Father, as we did.

151
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,200
Otherwise, it will be difficult.

152
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,359
Yes.

153
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,079
I will write to the Pope.

154
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:23,039
Come, I'll show you.

155
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,799
- Here will be a vegetable garden?
- Yes.

156
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:45,680
We will plant garlic, onions, turnips
and other similar plants.

157
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,680
- Onions and turnips are good.
- They are.

158
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,279
Leave room for flowers.

159
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:55,359
You won't eat flowers.

160
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:57,279
But they are beautiful.

161
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,079
Agnes, what have you done?

162
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,319
I want to be a nun like you.

163
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:28,759
- Did anyone see you?
- I came with a servant, but he went home.

164
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,359
Did you tell him to keep quiet?

165
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,400
Don't count on protection,
if your father comes here to get you.

166
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,319
What?

167
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,720
Our father died.

168
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,119
How so?

169
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,880
Was he sick?

170
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,559
Didn't you know?

171
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:06,160
Now Monaldo's uncle...

172
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:13,880
Monaldo's uncle forcibly
wants to marry me to Mr. Alfredo,

173
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,599
Ignazia's father. He is a widower.

174
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,680
But Mr. Alfredo is 70 years old!

175
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,880
Agnes?

176
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:08,720
Did our father suffer a lot?

177
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,119
Yes.

178
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:15,359
And he kept asking about you.

179
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:17,839
Until the last minute.

180
00:22:58,279 --> 00:22:59,200
Uncle!

181
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:03,960
- Let go!
- Let go of my sister!

182
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,359
Don't hurt her!

183
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,680
Let her go!

184
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,359
Your father was too good.
I would have killed you!

185
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,359
It hurts!

186
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:21,279
Let go!

187
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,240
Francis!

188
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:28,680
Francis!

189
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:36,160
- No, let me go!
- Let her go!

190
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:56,440
And what to put her on a horse!

191
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:58,559
Heavy as lead. Not to be moved.

192
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,119
Satanic demon!

193
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:22,319
- I will kill, not leave here!
- No!

194
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:51,119
On the horses!

195
00:24:57,559 --> 00:24:58,680
Let's go!

196
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:10,599
What happened?

197
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:13,960
You saw for yourself.

198
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:15,039
You have seen.

199
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:19,559
How did you do it?

200
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,920
Klara...

201
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,200
I admit that I am amazed.

202
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:04,039
Never before has the Holy Father been asked
to grant the female order

203
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:05,920
the privilege of poverty.

204
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:10,920
But so be it,
In the name of God Almighty.

205
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,880
Thus.

206
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:18,200
KNOWLEDGE...

207
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:21,759
That the hand of the heavenly bridegroom

208
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:23,880
rests under your head.

209
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:30,359
He who feeds the birds in the sky
And clothes the lilies of the field,

210
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:34,720
will not spare you
Neither food nor clothing.

211
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:40,880
And also in eternal life
will provide you with the same.

212
00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:45,000
So how did you bring ...

213
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:48,160
proposal
to maintain strict poverty

214
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,440
We support with apostolic grace.

215
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:57,559
So that no one forces you to own
any property.

216
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:08,960
"When the eighth day came
And it was necessary to circumcise Him,

217
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:12,519
He was given the name Jesus...

218
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,880
With which the angel called them,

219
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,200
Before it was conceived in the womb."

220
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:22,400
Let the words of the gospel
take away our sins.

221
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:33,440
After eight days had passed
Jesus was circumcised.

222
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:40,319
Think that today Jesus Christ begins to
shed his holy blood for us.

223
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,880
One who has never committed sin,

224
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:49,640
and even was the enemy of sin
and overcame all sin....

225
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:54,319
begins today
suffering for our sins.

226
00:31:56,759 --> 00:31:58,440
So cry with him.

227
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:01,000
With compassion.

228
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:04,440
Because he was crying uproariously today.

229
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:10,359
On this festive day

230
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:14,119
we should rejoice
of our salvation.

231
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:19,440
But we should also show compassion
Jesus Christ's suffering.

232
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:26,480
His body so noble and delicate....
Was cut by His mother.

233
00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:30,079
The baby Jesus cried.

234
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:34,720
And His mother also wept,
Mary the ever Virgin.

235
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,559
She certainly cried!

236
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,359
When my Tommaso died,
I was heartbroken.

237
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,519
Mother and son are one body.

238
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:49,039
She cried, and as the boy
was resting on her bosom,

239
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:53,640
is when he saw her crying,
he put his hand over her mouth....

240
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,559
And begged her by gesturing....

241
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,160
So that she doesn't cry.

242
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:07,519
They say that Brother Francis
stayed with the great sultan.

243
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:13,039
They talked a lot.
The Sultan listened attentively to his teachings.

244
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:14,279
Great.

245
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,200
The Lord told us to preach to all
salvation and poverty.

246
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:21,039
We want to go there, too.

247
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:23,759
- Along with my brothers.
- I will go with you.

248
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:28,799
- We will talk when Francis returns.
- For you, the journey is dangerous.

249
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,440
It is necessary to know their languages and Latin.

250
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:33,160
It's true.

251
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,480
If people do not understand
The preached Word,

252
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:38,400
They will take you for heretics.

253
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,720
I know Latin and some folk languages.

254
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:49,920
It's time for a meal.
I return to my duties.

255
00:33:54,359 --> 00:33:58,720
Pacific, when you go
collect alms, look for oil.

256
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:01,880
I will put the empty jug there, on the bench.

257
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,319
Be that as it may.

258
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:07,880
- Have you eaten?
- Some bread.

259
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,119
It's too dangerous.

260
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:36,320
- What's that cough, Balvino?
- Nothing like that, don't worry.

261
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:41,559
- We listened to beautiful words today.
- They are.

262
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:46,559
The joys and sorrows of our Lord
Associated with His birth.

263
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:50,280
As he lay in the manger,
He had a stone under his head.

264
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,880
I saw this stone in Bethlehem.

265
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:56,639
You really made a pilgrimage
To Bethlehem?

266
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:59,000
Yes, with my nanny I joined a monastery.

267
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,199
I would go there, too.

268
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:06,719
First to Morocco, where they martyred
our brothers. Then to Bethlehem.

269
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,119
Balvino,
didn't you meet wolves in Bethlehem?

270
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:11,519
Wolves?

271
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:16,199
The moon was full, we were asleep,
when we heard a howl.

272
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:22,199
One woman stood up,
because her child had to go to the need.

273
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,440
We had a stick to scare away the wolves.

274
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:42,960
With your bare hands you can't.
Wolves inspire fear.

275
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:46,800
- And they ran away?
- Yes, we scared them away.

276
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:52,440
Wolves are like dogs. They are afraid of the stick.

277
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:01,960
Today you are not fasting, Klara,
For you are wearing yourself out.

278
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:03,840
Francis already told you that.

279
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,920
If you don't eat
Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays,

280
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,519
then chew some bread
and sip a little water.

281
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:12,679
I eat some bread.

282
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,280
Don't worry about me.

283
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:20,400
Give some flour.

284
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:29,199
Who filled the jug?

285
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,840
Nobody. I was just about to take it.

286
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,599
- Did you fill it?
- How?

287
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:36,639
The jug was not full, but empty.

288
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:46,880
Pacifica found a full jug.
Did you put it there?

289
00:39:58,199 --> 00:39:59,480
It is full.

290
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,679
Right.

291
00:40:30,039 --> 00:40:31,000
Well!

292
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,320
You've never eaten like this.

293
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,920
It is a gift from God.

294
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Every meal is a gift from God.
Francis says.

295
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:48,760
Our Francis likes to eat!

296
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:52,559
I wonder what he eats in the East.

297
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:56,719
There they eat porridge
with almond milk and cinnamon.

298
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,119
For eating pork
Is threatened with cursing.

299
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:03,119
How can they live without pork?

300
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:07,280
- And what do they eat in Morocco?
- They eat bread. Like we do.

301
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,840
But this bread is like a sponge.

302
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,320
They pack inside
meat, herbs, pour oil.

303
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:19,840
Spongy bread?
Mother of God! My stomach swells from that!

304
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,119
Hello, Klara.

305
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:20,320
The Holy Father greets you.

306
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:24,880
- Much is being said about you in Rome.
- God be thanked.

307
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,480
And glory to Him forever.

308
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,679
A woman cannot live in poverty.

309
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,719
The Holy Father has given his consent,
But it cannot last.

310
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,000
The sisters live off the property.

311
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,320
They can't travel like brothers.

312
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,440
But we have an agreement.

313
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,559
Together we live in poverty.

314
00:42:51,639 --> 00:42:55,760
But if you don't own anything,
you don't have protection either.

315
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:59,079
As a prioress
you must protect your sisters.

316
00:43:00,039 --> 00:43:03,199
You call me a prioress
according to the rule of Benedict.

317
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,719
But we are not Benedictines.

318
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,159
I am the sister of my sisters.

319
00:43:09,159 --> 00:43:11,000
We live and hike together.

320
00:43:11,719 --> 00:43:14,840
Only servants can leave the cloister,
nuns cannot.

321
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:18,599
- You go all out.
- None of us is a servant.

322
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:20,239
There are no servants here.

323
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,599
We go all out, if necessary.

324
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:27,079
To carry the tablecloths to the altar.

325
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:30,639
To comfort the souls and bodies of the sick.

326
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,800
To work and ask for alms.

327
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:39,599
We go out to set an example for everyone,
How to live according to the gospel.

328
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:44,360
- Like Francis' brothers.
- But you are not brothers.

329
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:45,880
You are women.

330
00:43:46,599 --> 00:43:49,360
No woman can be an example.

331
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:53,559
We are children of God
and angels of His gospel.

332
00:43:54,679 --> 00:43:57,960
The risen Christ
revealed himself first to women.

333
00:43:58,039 --> 00:44:00,599
Yes, but remember Saint Paul,

334
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:04,000
Who said,
That a woman should remain silent.

335
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:06,280
And according to the Book of Kohelet....

336
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:09,719
woman is the cause of sin.

337
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:13,880
And through the fault of women we all die.

338
00:44:14,639 --> 00:44:16,840
And the Church Fathers?

339
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:21,039
They say that no apostle allowed
a woman to tower over a man.

340
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,599
Yes, but...

341
00:44:22,679 --> 00:44:26,079
A woman is tempted to sin with her body.

342
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,559
Today, thousands of young women...

343
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,199
wants to create a poor order,
such as yours.

344
00:44:39,079 --> 00:44:41,320
They are women who go barefoot.

345
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:45,440
And they call themselves "lesser sisters."

346
00:44:46,039 --> 00:44:48,840
They stain the name of the lesser brothers.

347
00:44:49,559 --> 00:44:52,320
And the true vow of poverty
Brother Francis.

348
00:44:56,119 --> 00:44:58,719
You guys won't be able to do what the brothers did.

349
00:45:01,159 --> 00:45:04,320
A woman always
sets an example with modesty

350
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,480
And a monastic cloister.

351
00:45:08,159 --> 00:45:10,039
So I can't travel?

352
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,639
Travel?

353
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,360
And where to?

354
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,000
Dogs! Scoundrels!

355
00:45:19,079 --> 00:45:22,599
Your tongues only pave my heart!

356
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,159
I wanted to live in love,

357
00:45:25,239 --> 00:45:29,360
To serve our Lord, our brothers!
But no!

358
00:45:30,039 --> 00:45:31,119
No!

359
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:36,440
They want us to wither
like the fig tree from the gospel!

360
00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:02,960
We will not go
Morocco or the Holy Land.

361
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:05,159
Ugolino said they would imprison us,

362
00:46:05,239 --> 00:46:07,840
will close the doors of the monastery,
if we move.

363
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,599
I think she is blazing a trail of hatred towards us.

364
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,039
May God support us.

365
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:19,320
They gave us bread and mushrooms
In exchange for tablecloths for the altars.

366
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:24,039
Light a fire and clean the mushrooms.
Coming.

367
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:36,440
Fly my song

368
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:41,840
Ask the nightingale in the forest

369
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:47,199
Will he greetings from me

370
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:53,519
This pale fair-haired beauty

371
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:58,960
Say I love her truly

372
00:48:59,639 --> 00:49:05,880
But I dare not say her name

373
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:41,440
Klara!

374
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:44,480
Klara!

375
00:51:45,199 --> 00:51:46,800
Help!

376
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:52,360
Pick it up!

377
00:51:54,639 --> 00:51:56,440
Klara?

378
00:51:57,519 --> 00:51:58,800
Klara?

379
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:11,679
I'm fine.

380
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:16,840
Nothing happened.

381
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:22,199
The door was as light as a coat.

382
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:39,360
Did I perform another miracle?

383
00:52:47,079 --> 00:52:50,039
The trip to the East taught me a lot.

384
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,840
We are the same people as others.

385
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:59,320
And being among the disbelievers,
we should not get into disputes.

386
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,360
Because we are Christians.

387
00:53:06,039 --> 00:53:08,119
Brothers of all creation.

388
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:12,159
God reveals himself in our actions.

389
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,880
And the gospel brings peace to people.

390
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,599
He does not offend anyone.

391
00:53:18,639 --> 00:53:20,960
This is the example we are to set:

392
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,960
Treat everyone as brothers.

393
00:53:26,039 --> 00:53:27,679
But Brother Francis...

394
00:53:28,719 --> 00:53:30,599
example alone...

395
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:33,079
We will not convert the infidels.

396
00:53:33,719 --> 00:53:36,440
We are not called to convert.

397
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:44,599
We are witnesses to the Word.

398
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,559
And others can see that.

399
00:53:55,679 --> 00:53:59,639
Cost these sweets.
They come with honey and almonds.

400
00:54:02,119 --> 00:54:05,440
Jacopa de' Settesoli
gave them to us in Rome.

401
00:54:07,159 --> 00:54:10,360
Jacopa is a woman, but she is like a brother.

402
00:54:11,639 --> 00:54:12,599
Elijah?

403
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:20,480
Who is this Jacopa?
Francis is founding a new order?

404
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:22,239
Don't.

405
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:26,719
Leon said that in the Portiuncula
terrible things were happening.

406
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:27,719
Which ones?

407
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:31,639
While we were away,
The brothers occupied the brick houses.

408
00:54:31,719 --> 00:54:34,719
When Francis saw this, he went crazy.

409
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,960
He climbed onto the roof and scattered everything.

410
00:54:39,039 --> 00:54:41,800
- Tiles, bricks...
- Well done.

411
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:44,760
But the houses do not belong to the brothers,
but to the authorities of Assisi.

412
00:54:46,239 --> 00:54:47,840
So we kept them.

413
00:54:49,239 --> 00:54:53,239
Now the brothers are sleeping in them,
even if Francis doesn't let them.

414
00:54:54,119 --> 00:54:58,239
And we should sleep in huts.
It's always been that way.

415
00:54:58,320 --> 00:54:59,960
Help yourself to sweets.

416
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:04,320
When you guys are away,
there's always something going on.

417
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:08,320
Even Philip asked the Pope
for protection for us.

418
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:12,159
- On our behalf!
- Do you want to? - No!

419
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,239
He had no bad intentions.
He did it for you.

420
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,039
We don't need anything.

421
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:29,159
Ugolino wants to impose a clause,
to protect us.

422
00:55:29,239 --> 00:55:33,400
We don't want to live in confinement.
This is how we are comfortable.

423
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:34,760
Klara?

424
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:36,880
Let me tell you a dream.

425
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:38,880
What kind of dream?

426
00:55:39,639 --> 00:55:43,440
I dreamt that I was a hen....
small and black.

427
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:49,000
I wanted to hide the chickens under my wings,
But I couldn't.

428
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:51,760
- Chickens are brothers.
- Who have grown up.

429
00:55:55,079 --> 00:55:59,320
- I can't control them anymore.
- Are they still chickens?

430
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:03,280
And the Knights of the Round Table
Where are they now?

431
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:08,079
I cannot torment my own brothers.

432
00:56:09,239 --> 00:56:12,480
- As the mighty do.
- No, Francis.

433
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,679
But you have to defend your work.

434
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:17,840
- Our work.
- How?

435
00:56:18,519 --> 00:56:19,960
By force?

436
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:22,639
Should I become a ruler?

437
00:56:26,119 --> 00:56:27,599
I will not be him.

438
00:56:28,199 --> 00:56:29,480
It's not for me.

439
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:37,320
How's that? Good?

440
00:56:39,159 --> 00:56:41,000
He looks happy.

441
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:44,280
But he is sick.

442
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:48,000
His eyes are failing.

443
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:57,639
If you don't rest,
you will not recover.

444
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,199
How does it feel?

445
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:31,760
Her throat hurts.
It's better for her to sleep now.

446
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:35,320
- I dreamt that she regained her speech.
- Another dream!

447
00:57:37,239 --> 00:57:39,519
Scrofula cannot be cured.

448
00:57:40,119 --> 00:57:43,079
You stop talking, then you die.

449
00:57:43,159 --> 00:57:45,840
My dream was beautiful.
It seemed real.

450
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:07,559
Ms. Klara should not wash my feet.

451
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:11,119
I just came here.
I am a newcomer.

452
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:15,920
She always does it.
We wash each other's feet.

453
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,239
But it's a priori.

454
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:21,400
If Clare hears you...

455
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:24,599
We are minor sisters.
There is no prioress here.

456
00:58:25,559 --> 00:58:26,599
Yes.

457
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:42,119
Mrs. Klara ... don't wash my feet.

458
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:46,800
I walked all day.
They stink, they're dirty....

459
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:49,159
It's okay now. Be calm.

460
00:58:55,519 --> 00:58:57,719
I don't like between my fingers!

461
00:59:01,039 --> 00:59:02,639
Enough is enough.

462
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:04,599
Well...

463
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,599
Enough!

464
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:09,000
God!

465
00:59:09,519 --> 00:59:11,400
Klara!

466
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:13,559
- Does it hurt?
- Sorry!

467
00:59:13,639 --> 00:59:16,280
- Does it hurt?
- It's not a big deal.

468
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:18,840
The blood... is still flowing...

469
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:20,880
It's nothing.

470
00:59:22,599 --> 00:59:25,360
Bull of Pope Honorius III

471
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:28,119
Regarding the Rule of the Friars Minor.

472
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:35,239
Chapter Eleven.

473
00:59:36,119 --> 00:59:39,039
I firmly command all brothers,

474
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:43,039
so that they don't have
suspicious conversations with women

475
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:45,480
and that they should not enter the homes of nuns.

476
00:59:46,599 --> 00:59:49,960
And that they should not be godfathers of
of men and women.

477
00:59:50,039 --> 00:59:55,280
So that it does not lead to mischief
Among the brethren or in matters pertaining to them.

478
01:00:03,039 --> 01:00:06,480
You! You said,
That you don't want to write down the rule!

479
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:09,119
That you are God's last madman!

480
01:00:09,199 --> 01:00:10,679
He had to do it that way.

481
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:14,239
- The first rule was not approved.
- Of course.

482
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:15,559
And this one?

483
01:00:15,639 --> 01:00:17,440
Who wrote it for you?

484
01:00:17,519 --> 01:00:19,199
- Ugolino himself?
- Klara!

485
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:23,360
I'm here to talk!
New rule makes no mention of poverty

486
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:25,960
Nor about revolt against the mighty.

487
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:29,639
There is nothing left of your
First proposal. Our proposal.

488
01:00:32,719 --> 01:00:37,440
You are angry because I wrote,
That the sisters and we are to live separately.

489
01:00:37,519 --> 01:00:38,800
Separately?

490
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:42,800
- We started together.
- I couldn't have done otherwise.

491
01:00:46,119 --> 01:00:47,679
You could.

492
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:51,920
We have a new rule
and thanks to it we are still lasting.

493
01:00:53,199 --> 01:00:55,840
You should write a rule for the sisters.

494
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:59,599
So that what we have already done,
Has not been in vain.

495
01:01:01,559 --> 01:01:03,920
Write a rule,
Which will be approved by the pope.

496
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,039
Why are you telling me what to do?

497
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:09,480
Sisters do not have to listen to brothers.

498
01:01:09,559 --> 01:01:12,559
- You said.
- Do what you want to do.

499
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:23,559
Don't come to St. Damian anymore.

500
01:01:25,199 --> 01:01:27,440
Follow your rule.

501
01:01:29,639 --> 01:01:32,000
Stay away from women.
Everyone.

502
01:01:34,039 --> 01:01:35,400
Are you afraid?

503
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:38,000
Are we dangerous?

504
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:40,559
So stay here.

505
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:44,320
You are no longer welcome with us.

506
01:02:01,679 --> 01:02:03,480
Balvina dies.

507
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:17,320
Her time has come.

508
01:02:18,639 --> 01:02:21,599
Our prayers were of no avail.

509
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:51,440
Walk away.

510
01:02:55,719 --> 01:02:57,119
Walk away.

511
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:00,159
Down!

512
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:08,480
Pacifica,
boil an egg and bring it here.

513
01:03:58,360 --> 01:03:59,480
Go.

514
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:35,400
Did she die?

515
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:38,840
Don't.

516
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:42,280
Give her water.

517
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:47,000
When she speaks again,
bring her to me.

518
01:05:11,159 --> 01:05:12,760
Go...

519
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:15,159
tell Clara that I am healthy.

520
01:05:29,679 --> 01:05:32,840
She recovered.
Balvina has recovered.

521
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:22,199
Francis wrote a new rule.

522
01:07:24,159 --> 01:07:25,840
It has been approved.

523
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:28,719
And what's in it?

524
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:35,320
Brothers should not approach women.

525
01:07:38,239 --> 01:07:40,880
They are not allowed to walk
the same roads.

526
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:43,599
Neither eat together.

527
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:50,920
Brothers are not allowed to take
From women vows of obedience.

528
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:54,639
And Francis did that with us.

529
01:07:54,719 --> 01:07:56,800
We vowed to obey him.

530
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:05,519
Now what?

531
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,719
We were left alone.

532
01:08:14,199 --> 01:08:15,440
But we are together.

533
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:54,960
Let us sing together with joy

534
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:58,800
Let us sing together with joy

535
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:02,279
With a loud voice, let us sing with joy

536
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:06,720
Let's sing joyful hallelujahs loudly

537
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:11,319
With a heart devoted to God
let us sing alleluia

538
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:18,000
With a heart devoted to God
let us sing alleluia

539
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:29,479
Ms. Klara ...

540
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:35,479
We are from Spoleto, my son is sick.

541
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:37,840
What happened?

542
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:40,640
- Does it hurt?
- Yes.

543
01:11:42,119 --> 01:11:43,960
- How long does it take?
- One week.

544
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,079
Come.

545
01:11:47,279 --> 01:11:50,640
Benvenuta, bring water,
jug and a small tool.

546
01:11:59,239 --> 01:12:01,399
Did you put something up your nose?

547
01:12:18,079 --> 01:12:19,560
It was a stone.

548
01:12:21,199 --> 01:12:25,039
- Dill broth and cloth!
- It's a miracle!

549
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:30,119
With the sign of the cross on the forehead
Healed my son!

550
01:12:30,199 --> 01:12:32,920
- A miracle!
- Quiet. It's no miracle.

551
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,600
A miracle!

552
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:38,239
- What kind of miracle?
- A miracle!

553
01:12:38,319 --> 01:12:40,520
Enough! You're stupid!

554
01:12:42,079 --> 01:12:44,319
I just took the stone out of his nose!

555
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:57,880
When the stench starts to bother you,
cover your nose.

556
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:01,199
It stinks less in winter than in summer.

557
01:13:01,279 --> 01:13:04,680
If we cover our noses,
these people won't be sorry?

558
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:08,760
A stink is a stink.
We know it and they know it too.

559
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:11,199
The mouth must be covered.

560
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:14,039
Otherwise the plague will attack.

561
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,840
I will bandage you up.

562
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:52,680
And already.

563
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:56,159
You are young.

564
01:13:56,239 --> 01:13:58,560
You don't remember these forests.

565
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:02,239
We used to go there with our mothers

566
01:14:02,319 --> 01:14:05,520
pick wild strawberries....

567
01:14:07,079 --> 01:14:08,720
wild apples.

568
01:14:11,239 --> 01:14:13,159
Then they cut down the trees.

569
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:16,319
And now there are fields there.

570
01:14:17,159 --> 01:14:19,840
Well cared for... plowed...

571
01:14:24,079 --> 01:14:26,760
I would like to see those forests again.

572
01:14:34,119 --> 01:14:37,600
To her I gave a maiden.
And you want a rooster? Take it.

573
01:14:39,079 --> 01:14:42,640
And do you want a dog or a sheep?
A dog is nice.

574
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:46,239
A sheep? Then take the sheep.

575
01:14:47,439 --> 01:14:49,760
I made them for little Tommas.

576
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:52,199
He never parted with one dog.

577
01:14:52,279 --> 01:14:54,840
Then he grew up and didn't play anymore.

578
01:14:56,279 --> 01:14:57,880
Do you want it?

579
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:01,000
Take.

580
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:04,479
Don't you want to?

581
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:06,239
They are afraid of you.

582
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:08,840
Are they afraid?

583
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:10,640
Why?

584
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:13,199
Because you are holy and do miracles.

585
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:16,199
Is that not true?

586
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:02,319
Francis...

587
01:16:06,479 --> 01:16:08,880
"Don't take anything on the road.

588
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:11,720
Neither a staff nor a bag," says our Lord.

589
01:16:13,279 --> 01:16:15,800
And now I'm constantly walking with a stick.

590
01:16:18,119 --> 01:16:20,439
Pacific said,
That you have found a new medic.

591
01:16:21,279 --> 01:16:24,479
- Ugolino sought him out in Rieti.
- In Rieti?

592
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:27,479
So why did you come here?

593
01:16:28,279 --> 01:16:29,760
You're overextending yourself.

594
01:16:32,119 --> 01:16:34,000
To see your face.

595
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:38,640
Perhaps for the last time.

596
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:47,079
And you?
Didn't you want to see all of me?

597
01:16:50,359 --> 01:16:52,279
Do you know what they will do when I die?

598
01:16:53,079 --> 01:16:56,319
They will cut me
And sell the pieces to the churches.

599
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:03,600
Let's pray together.

600
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:06,960
Let's recite a psalm praising the
Creator's love.

601
01:17:11,279 --> 01:17:13,520
Now that my eyes can't see,

602
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:15,640
shows me the beauty of the world.

603
01:17:18,399 --> 01:17:21,119
Let Clare read, because she knows Latin.

604
01:17:29,319 --> 01:17:31,159
- Hallelujah.
- Hallelujah.

605
01:17:44,359 --> 01:17:45,720
Klara!

606
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:49,239
In our language, because the sisters do not understand.

607
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,760
Praise the Lord from the heavens.

608
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:05,640
Praise Him on high.

609
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:10,279
Praise Him, all His angels.

610
01:18:11,359 --> 01:18:13,720
Praise Him, sun and moon.

611
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:18,039
Praise Him,
All the shining stars.

612
01:18:18,119 --> 01:18:20,479
It's like the smile of the universe,

613
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:22,439
our earthly paradise.

614
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:33,319
We should pray in the language of the people.

615
01:18:34,079 --> 01:18:35,760
How we preach.

616
01:18:36,359 --> 01:18:40,079
But it is not allowed to translate the Bible
into our language.

617
01:18:40,159 --> 01:18:42,800
Today we did it, but that's not the way to do it.

618
01:18:45,159 --> 01:18:47,520
That's why I wrote my own prayer.

619
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,600
In our language.

620
01:18:51,239 --> 01:18:53,000
Which we all understand.

621
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:56,640
Educated and simple people.

622
01:18:58,279 --> 01:18:59,840
Women and children.

623
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:05,840
Then we will understand,
what we are praying for.

624
01:19:07,079 --> 01:19:08,279
Refuse it.

625
01:19:09,399 --> 01:19:10,880
I'm not done yet.

626
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:14,840
Writing tires my eyes.

627
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:17,520
I will work on it at night.

628
01:19:23,199 --> 01:19:25,359
Klara!

629
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:28,359
Francis is feeling unwell.
He asks you to come.

630
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:51,439
I'm blind!

631
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:55,119
Rats!

632
01:20:01,239 --> 01:20:02,680
I'm blind!

633
01:20:04,319 --> 01:20:06,159
I'm blind!

634
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:24,399
I am blind...

635
01:20:26,199 --> 01:20:28,039
I'm blind, Klara.

636
01:20:35,319 --> 01:20:36,920
I turned off the light.

637
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:39,520
Together we are blind.

638
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:47,920
Don't cry.

639
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:54,159
I'm not crying.
But you don't cry either.

640
01:20:57,159 --> 01:20:58,279
Sleep.

641
01:21:00,079 --> 01:21:02,000
Sleep, Francis.

642
01:21:18,359 --> 01:21:22,359
Sickness and suffering
Is your way to eternal life.

643
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:21,800
Supreme, almighty, good Lord,

644
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:26,159
Yours is the fame, glory and honor,
And all blessings.

645
01:22:27,319 --> 01:22:30,079
Only to You, the Most High, do they befit,

646
01:22:30,159 --> 01:22:33,039
And no man is worthy
To name you.

647
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:37,880
Praised be, O Lord,
With all thy creations,

648
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:40,800
First of all, with brother sun,

649
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:44,800
Which the day creates,
And you shine through them.

650
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:48,399
And it is beautiful and radiant
In great splendor.

651
01:22:49,239 --> 01:22:52,640
Yours, the Most High,
is the image.

652
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:57,600
Praised be, Lord,
By brother moon and stars.

653
01:22:57,680 --> 01:23:01,319
Thou hast formed them in heaven
bright, precious and beautiful,

654
01:23:02,399 --> 01:23:06,119
Praised be, Lord,
By brother wind and air,

655
01:23:06,199 --> 01:23:09,239
And cloudy and cheerful time, and all kinds of time,

656
01:23:09,319 --> 01:23:12,920
and through which
you give creatures sustenance.

657
01:23:14,159 --> 01:23:17,520
Praised be, Lord,
By sister water.

658
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:21,600
What useful is great, and humble,
And precious, and pure.

659
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:28,119
Praised be, O Lord, by the brother fire
With which you light the night.

660
01:23:28,199 --> 01:23:32,199
And he is beautiful and joyful,
And strong, and powerful.

661
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:36,680
Praised be, O Lord,
By our sister mother earth,

662
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:38,840
Which nourishes and hides us.

663
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:42,319
And it bears various fruits
With colorful flowers and herbs.

664
01:23:43,279 --> 01:23:47,000
Praised be, O Lord, by those,
Who forgive for the sake of your love

665
01:23:47,079 --> 01:23:50,239
And endure weakness and affliction.

666
01:23:51,159 --> 01:23:53,479
Blessed are,
Who persevere in peace,

667
01:23:53,560 --> 01:23:56,479
For through You, Most High,
they shall be crowned.

668
01:23:58,760 --> 01:24:02,760
Praised be, Lord,
Through our sister, bodily death,

669
01:24:02,840 --> 01:24:05,680
Which no man alive
can't outrun.

670
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:08,760
Woe to those who will die
In mortal sins.

671
01:24:09,479 --> 01:24:12,359
Blessed are,
Who find themselves in Your will,

672
01:24:12,439 --> 01:24:14,960
For the second death
evil shall not do unto them.

673
01:24:16,039 --> 01:24:18,159
Praise and bless the Lord

674
01:24:18,239 --> 01:24:21,560
And do thanks to Him,
And serve Him with great humility.

675
01:24:50,399 --> 01:24:52,640
Won't you say goodbye to me!

676
01:25:00,319 --> 01:25:02,800
I just wanted to be with people.

677
01:25:04,279 --> 01:25:08,840
I didn't want to scare them.
I didn't want them to call me a saint.

678
01:25:17,399 --> 01:25:20,279
Human affairs are difficult for us.

679
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:26,520
But you are strong.

680
01:25:28,399 --> 01:25:30,800
Stronger than your brother Francis.

681
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:12,000
We go to the village.
Maybe we can find flour.

682
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:41,239
Your food,
Balvino sister, is good.

683
01:27:42,279 --> 01:27:45,279
- Did you guys do it?
- Yes, Your Holiness.

684
01:27:45,359 --> 01:27:48,479
This is the duty of a servant of our Lord.

685
01:27:49,119 --> 01:27:52,039
These dishes are delicious and flavorful.

686
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:56,840
Worthy not of a servant, but of a lady.

687
01:28:05,720 --> 01:28:07,840
I want to write our rule.

688
01:28:10,319 --> 01:28:14,439
- There are no rules written by women.
- Ours will be the first.

689
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:21,760
We will only approve the cloister rule.

690
01:28:23,319 --> 01:28:24,960
You know it, Klara.

691
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:27,720
Just a clause.

692
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:30,000
Yes, Clause.

693
01:28:31,319 --> 01:28:33,399
But according to our rule.

694
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,479
Some sisters
work outside the convent.

695
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:45,319
And we must preserve the privilege of poverty.

696
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:50,640
Now I am the Pope.

697
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,680
I can free you from the vow of poverty.

698
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:58,960
Holy Father, I do not desire at all
exemption from this vow.

699
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:01,960
So did my sisters.

700
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:05,520
Just watch!

701
01:29:06,079 --> 01:29:08,720
You are leading into temptation
The poor sinner.

702
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:13,279
You were not such a generous hostess....

703
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:16,119
When I was a cardinal.

704
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:23,760
With our rule, we do not want
have a vicar and superiors.

705
01:29:25,079 --> 01:29:27,159
We are lesser sisters.

706
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:30,600
Like brothers. Those of Francis.

707
01:29:35,560 --> 01:29:37,119
Brothers...

708
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,800
Francis has been dead for two years.

709
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:43,600
And everything has changed.

710
01:29:54,920 --> 01:29:56,720
Your Holiness...

711
01:29:57,560 --> 01:30:01,199
With holy patience and wisdom
anything can be done.

712
01:30:04,760 --> 01:30:06,800
Are you not eating, Ms. Klara?

713
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:10,800
You know that in the world...

714
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:15,039
many conventions are emerging,
Where sisters live like you?

715
01:30:15,119 --> 01:30:18,000
Even in Bohemia, the emperor's daughter...

716
01:30:18,760 --> 01:30:21,800
Yes, I exchange letters
With Agnes Czech.

717
01:30:21,880 --> 01:30:23,800
Holy patience!

718
01:30:24,359 --> 01:30:25,359
Klara...

719
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:29,600
Be temperate in your judgment of
of these important women.

720
01:30:30,359 --> 01:30:32,880
For the sake of yourself and your sisters.

721
01:30:57,560 --> 01:30:58,680
Write.

722
01:31:00,079 --> 01:31:02,039
And I'll look at your rule.

723
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:35,960
Balvino.

724
01:31:36,640 --> 01:31:38,399
What do we have to eat?

725
01:31:38,840 --> 01:31:41,800
Almost nothing.
Just a bit of bread.

726
01:31:44,199 --> 01:31:47,920
Let's cut the bread.
There are 50 of us, into 50 pieces.

727
01:31:48,479 --> 01:31:49,800
Not enough.

728
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:54,319
Slice. Enough.

729
01:35:24,640 --> 01:35:27,720
KLARA
