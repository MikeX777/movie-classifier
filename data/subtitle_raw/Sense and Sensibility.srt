1
00:01:07,835 --> 00:01:10,771
Your son is arrived from London.

2
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:18,779
- Father ...
- John ...

3
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:27,754
You will see in my will the estate
of Norland was left to me in a way -

4
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:34,194
- that prevents me from dividing it
between my two families.

5
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:42,469
Norland, in its entirety,
is therefore yours by law.

6
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:48,675
And I am happy for you and Fanny.

7
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:57,150
But your stepmother, my wife and
daughters are left only 500 a year.

8
00:01:57,317 --> 00:02:02,189
Barely enough to live on.
Nothing for the girls' dowries.

9
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:09,263
- You must help them.
- Of course.

10
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:12,933
You must promise to do this.

11
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:19,640
I promise, Father.
I promise.

12
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,343
Help them? What do you mean?

13
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:31,118
I mean to give them 3,000. The
interest will be an extra income.

14
00:02:31,285 --> 00:02:38,125
- The gift will fulfil my promise.
- Without question. More than amply.

15
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:44,364
One had rather. on such occasions.
do too much than too little.

16
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:49,036
Of course, he did not stipulate
a particular sum.

17
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:54,274
What do you say to 1,500, then?

18
00:02:54,408 --> 00:02:59,980
What brother would be so kind to his
real sisters. Let alone half-blood?

19
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:06,286
- They can hardly expect more.
- What can you afford?

20
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:16,330
100 a year to their mother is
better than losing 1,500 at once.

21
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:22,569
Should she live longer than 15 years
we'd be completely taken in.

22
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:27,407
People live forever
when an annuity is to be paid them.

23
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:33,881
20 now and then will amply
discharge my promise, you're right.

24
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:39,853
I'm convinced that your father
had no idea of giving them money.

25
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:45,559
- They will have 500 a year.
- What more could they want for?

26
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:51,565
No housekeeping, carriage, horses,
few servants, keeping no company ...

27
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:54,067
How comfortable!

28
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:59,139
They will be much more able
to give you something.

29
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:23,997
Marianne.
can you play something else?

30
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:28,735
Mamma has been weeping
since breakfast.

31
00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:40,113
I meant something less mournful.

32
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:48,589
A visitor in my own home!
It is not to be borne. Elinor.

33
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:54,294
- Mamma, we have nowhere to go.
- John and Fanny will be here soon.

34
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:59,066
Do you expect me to be here
to welcome them? Vultures!

35
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:17,184
I will start making inquiries
for a new house at once.

36
00:05:17,351 --> 00:05:21,822
Until then, we must try
to bear their coming.

37
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:29,796
Margaret, are you there? Come down,
John and Fanny will be here soon.

38
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:36,470
Why are they to live at Norland?
They have a house in London.

39
00:05:36,637 --> 00:05:44,211
Houses go from father to son, not
father to daughter. It is the law.

40
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:51,518
- Come, we'll play with your atlas.
- It's not mine. it's their atlas.

41
00:05:57,758 --> 00:06:00,928
Do sit down.

42
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:08,869
We are looking for a new home, and
can only retain Thomas and Betsy.

43
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:12,739
We're sorry
to have to leave you all.

44
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:19,179
But we are certain you will find the
new Mrs. Dashwood a fair mistress.

45
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:24,885
My only real concern is how long
it will take them to move out.

46
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:51,778
- How is Mrs. Ferrars?
- She is always in good health.

47
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:56,884
My brother is with her this season.
Quite the most popular bachelor.

48
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,419
He has his own barouche.

49
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:09,429
- You have two brothers?
- Yes. Edward is the elder.

50
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:13,934
He's travelling up from Plymouth
and will break his journey here.

51
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:23,977
- If that is agreeable to you.
- Dear John ...

52
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:27,414
This is your home now.

53
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:36,456
- Fanny wants the key to the silver.
- What does Fanny want with it?

54
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:41,461
One can presume she wants
to count it. What are you doing?

55
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:48,502
Gifts for the servants. Where is
Margaret? She's taken to hiding.

56
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:55,375
- At least she can escape Fanny.
- You've not said a word to her.

57
00:07:55,576 --> 00:08:00,113
I have.
I've said yes and no.

58
00:08:13,527 --> 00:08:16,830
Good morning, Fanny.

59
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:21,068
Good morning, Miss Marianne.

60
00:08:21,235 --> 00:08:25,973
How did you find the silver?
Was it all genuine?

61
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:31,879
- When may we expect your brother?
- Edward is due tomorrow.

62
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:39,486
He will not stay long. Will Margaret
give up her room for him?

63
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:46,026
The view is incomparable, and I
want him to see Norland at its best.

64
00:09:08,015 --> 00:09:12,553
Mrs. Dashwood.
Miss Dashwood. Miss Marianne.

65
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:16,089
My brother, Edward Ferrars.

66
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:20,360
Do sit down.

67
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:27,968
Where is Miss Margaret? I'm
beginning to doubt of her existence.

68
00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:34,041
Forgive us, Mr. Ferrars. My youngest
is shy of strangers at present.

69
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:41,815
I am shy of strangers myself,
and I have nothing like her excuse.

70
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:46,286
How do you like your view,
Mr. Ferrars?

71
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:53,393
Very much. Your stables are handsome
and beautifully kept.

72
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,930
Stables?
Your windows overlook the lake.

73
00:09:57,097 --> 00:10:03,403
An error led me to a family room,
but I've rectified the situation.

74
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:08,275
I am happily installed
in the guest quarters.

75
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:11,245
Tea!

76
00:10:11,912 --> 00:10:18,385
They're all spoilt. Miss Margaret is
always up trees and under furniture.

77
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:22,155
I've barely had a civil word
from Marianne.

78
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:28,929
They've just lost their father.
Their lives will never be the same.

79
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:32,366
That is no excuse.

80
00:10:34,735 --> 00:10:36,937
Library.

81
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:45,779
- These are mostly foreign.
- Indeed. Magnificent.

82
00:10:45,946 --> 00:10:49,716
I've never liked the smell of books.

83
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:55,689
The dust, perhaps. I hear you have
great plans for the walnut grove.

84
00:10:55,856 --> 00:11:00,827
I shall have it knocked down
to make place for a Grecian temple.

85
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:06,633
That does sound interesting.
Would you show me the site?

86
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:18,512
Too expensive, and we do not need
four bedrooms. We can share.

87
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:20,914
This one. then.

88
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:24,785
We have only 500 a year.

89
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:28,155
I'll send out more inquiries today.

90
00:11:31,892 --> 00:11:38,966
Pardon my intrusion, but I think I
have found what you're looking for.

91
00:11:48,242 --> 00:11:52,546
Won't you come out?
We haven't seen you all day.

92
00:11:52,713 --> 00:12:00,954
We'll have to enlarge it. Mattocks
will help you adjust toyour hours.

93
00:12:02,256 --> 00:12:11,298
Forgive me, do you by any chance
have a reliable atlas?

94
00:12:11,465 --> 00:12:16,603
- I believe so.
- I must check the Nile's position.

95
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:21,208
My sister tells me
it is in South America.

96
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:28,115
No!
No, she's quite wrong.

97
00:12:28,282 --> 00:12:32,452
I believe it is in Belgium.

98
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:36,723
Surely not.
You must be thinking of the Volga.

99
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:42,196
- The Volga, which starts in ...
- In Vladivostok. and ends in ...

100
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:46,400
- Wimbledon.
- Yes. where coffee beans come from.

101
00:12:46,567 --> 00:12:50,204
The source of the Nile
is in Abyssinia.

102
00:12:50,337 --> 00:12:55,075
Is it? Interesting.

103
00:12:55,242 --> 00:13:01,114
- How do you do? Edward Ferrars.
- Margaret Dashwood.

104
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:06,587
It adjoins this property,
and would be a desirable addition.

105
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:12,159
- I'll ride there and speak to ...
- Gibson.

106
00:13:12,326 --> 00:13:19,566
- He'll be pleased enough to sell.
- He'll want more than it is worth.

107
00:13:49,596 --> 00:13:52,199
Have I hurt you?

108
00:14:54,194 --> 00:14:57,764
Thank you.
Forgive me.

109
00:14:58,599 --> 00:15:01,768
That was my father's favourite.

110
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:10,544
Thank you for helping Margaret.
She's changed since you came.

111
00:15:10,711 --> 00:15:13,714
I enjoy her company.

112
00:15:13,881 --> 00:15:18,085
- Has she shown you the tree house?
- Not yet.

113
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:23,423
Would you do me the honour,
Miss Dashwood?

114
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:28,128
- It is very fine out.
- With pleasure.

115
00:15:29,796 --> 00:15:35,135
- Margaret always wanted to travel.
- I know. She's off to China soon.

116
00:15:35,302 --> 00:15:41,308
I'm to go as her servant, on the
understanding I'll be badly treated.

117
00:15:41,475 --> 00:15:48,015
- What will your duties be?
- Sword fighting and swabbing.

118
00:15:48,215 --> 00:15:50,951
Which will take precedence?

119
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:05,165
All I have ever wanted
is the quiet of a private life.

120
00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:10,337
But my mother is determined
to see me distinguished.

121
00:16:10,504 --> 00:16:17,744
Orator. Politician. Even a barrister
would do. if I drove a barouche.

122
00:16:17,878 --> 00:16:20,848
What do you wish for?

123
00:16:21,014 --> 00:16:25,819
I prefer the church, but that is not
smart enough for my mother.

124
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:30,624
She prefers the army,
but that is too smart for me.

125
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:34,695
- Would you stay in London?
- I hate London.

126
00:16:34,862 --> 00:16:40,234
Country living is my ideal. A small
parish where I might do some good.

127
00:16:40,434 --> 00:16:44,605
Keep chickens ...
Give very short sermons.

128
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:53,380
You feel idle and useless.
Imagine how that is compounded -

129
00:16:53,547 --> 00:16:59,353
- when one has no choice
of any occupation whatsoever.

130
00:17:00,721 --> 00:17:04,758
Our circumstances are therefore
precisely the same.

131
00:17:04,925 --> 00:17:08,695
Except that you will inherit
your fortune.

132
00:17:10,497 --> 00:17:14,668
We cannot even earnyours.

133
00:17:14,835 --> 00:17:20,674
Perhaps Margaret is right.
Piracy isyour only option.

134
00:17:22,576 --> 00:17:25,946
What is swabbing exactly?

135
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:31,051
"No voice divine the storm allayed.
No light propitious shone."

136
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:36,723
'When snatched from all effectual
aid, we perished, each alone."

137
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:42,262
"But l, beneath a rougher sea, and
whelmed in deeper gulfs than he ..."

138
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:44,531
No. Edward.

139
00:17:44,698 --> 00:17:49,236
'"No voice divine the storm allayed.
No light propitious shone."

140
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:53,974
'When snatched from all effectual
aid, we perished, each alone."

141
00:17:54,174 --> 00:17:59,112
Can you not feel his despair?
Try again.

142
00:18:04,318 --> 00:18:10,724
"No voice divine the storm allayed.
No light propitious shone."

143
00:18:10,891 --> 00:18:16,396
'When snatched from all effectual
aid, we perished, each alone."

144
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:22,736
Mamma ...

145
00:18:24,071 --> 00:18:28,909
Look.
This has just arrived.

146
00:18:29,076 --> 00:18:34,481
"l should be pleased to offer you a
home at Barton Cottage, as soon ..."

147
00:18:34,648 --> 00:18:39,019
- It's from Sir John Middleton.
- Even Elinor must approve the rent.

148
00:18:39,186 --> 00:18:43,590
- Has she not yet seen this?
- No. I will fetch her.

149
00:18:43,757 --> 00:18:46,894
Wait, let us delay.

150
00:18:47,027 --> 00:18:53,100
I believe that Edward and Elinor
have formed an attachment.

151
00:18:53,267 --> 00:18:58,405
It would be cruel to take her away
so soon. Devonshire is so far.

152
00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:04,144
- Do you disapprove her choice?
- By no means.

153
00:19:04,311 --> 00:19:09,149
- Edward is very amiable.
- Amiable? But ..?

154
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:14,855
There is something wanting.
He is too sedate. His reading ...

155
00:19:15,022 --> 00:19:18,425
Elinor has not your feelings.

156
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:24,898
Can he love her? Can the soul
be satisfied with polite affections?

157
00:19:25,065 --> 00:19:29,903
To love is to be on fire.
Like Juliet. Guinevere. Heloise.

158
00:19:30,103 --> 00:19:35,843
- They made rather pathetic ends.
- Pathetic? To die for love?

159
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:41,014
- What could be more glorious?
- Your romantic sensibilities ...

160
00:19:47,855 --> 00:19:55,028
"Is love a fancy or a feeling? No,
it is immortal as immaculate truth."

161
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:59,333
"It is not a blossom shed
when outh drops from life's stem."

162
00:19:59,499 --> 00:20:07,040
"It grows without water, nor ray of
promise cheats the pensive gloom."

163
00:20:09,576 --> 00:20:12,179
A pity
Edward has no passion for reading.

164
00:20:12,346 --> 00:20:18,585
You asked him to read.
then you made him nervous.

165
00:20:18,752 --> 00:20:25,726
Your behaviour is cordial. You
like him in spite of his reading.

166
00:20:25,893 --> 00:20:33,066
I think him everything
that is amiable and worthy.

167
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:36,136
Praise. indeed.

168
00:20:36,336 --> 00:20:41,475
He shall have my devotion when
you tell me he is to be my brother.

169
00:20:41,675 --> 00:20:46,113
- What shall I do without you?
- Without me?

170
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:52,386
I'm sure you will be very happy,
but promise you won't live far away.

171
00:20:52,553 --> 00:20:59,593
- There is no question of ...
- Do you love him?

172
00:21:01,495 --> 00:21:07,968
I do not deny that I think
very highly of him. That I ...

173
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:13,674
... greatly esteem him.
I like him.

174
00:21:13,874 --> 00:21:21,215
Esteem? Like? Use these words again
and I shall leave the room!

175
00:21:21,348 --> 00:21:27,421
Believe my feelings to be stronger.
Further than that. do not believe.

176
00:21:29,056 --> 00:21:32,259
Is love a fancy or a feeling?

177
00:21:32,426 --> 00:21:36,430
- Or a Ferrars?
- Go to bed.

178
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:42,970
"l do not deny
that I think very highly of him."

179
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:46,874
"That I ... greatly esteem him."

180
00:21:48,942 --> 00:21:52,546
"That I like him."

181
00:22:10,831 --> 00:22:15,502
We are so happy
that you invited Edward to Norland.

182
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:19,006
We're all very fond of him.

183
00:22:19,173 --> 00:22:25,746
We have great hopes for him.
Mother expects much of him.

184
00:22:25,946 --> 00:22:32,019
And in marriage. She's determined
both he and Robert will marry well.

185
00:22:32,186 --> 00:22:36,323
But I hope she desires them
to marry for love.

186
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:43,497
The heart doesn't always lead us
in the most suitable direction.

187
00:22:44,398 --> 00:22:52,072
Edward is a compassionate person.
Penniless women prey on that type.

188
00:22:52,239 --> 00:22:59,546
Having entered into an understanding
he would never go back on his word.

189
00:22:59,713 --> 00:23:03,050
But it would lead to his ruin.

190
00:23:03,217 --> 00:23:08,956
I'm worried. Mother will withdraw
all financial support from him -

191
00:23:09,156 --> 00:23:15,395
- should he plant affection in less
exalted ground than he deserves.

192
00:23:16,797 --> 00:23:20,734
I understand you perfectly.

193
00:23:24,872 --> 00:23:26,940
Devonshire?

194
00:23:27,107 --> 00:23:33,013
My cousin, Sir John Middleton,
has offered us a small house.

195
00:23:33,146 --> 00:23:35,816
He must be a man of property.

196
00:23:36,016 --> 00:23:41,288
He's a widower from Barton Park.
It is Barton Cottage he has offered.

197
00:23:41,455 --> 00:23:46,426
A cottage? Charming.
A cottage is always very snug.

198
00:23:46,593 --> 00:23:50,664
You will not leave
before the summer?

199
00:23:50,864 --> 00:23:55,669
We can no longer trespass
upon your sister's goodwill.

200
00:23:55,836 --> 00:24:00,240
- You will come and stay with us.
- I should like that.

201
00:24:00,407 --> 00:24:03,644
Edward has long been expected
byyour mother.

202
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:10,450
Come as soon as you can, Edward.
Remember, you're always welcome.

203
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:42,316
- Can't you take him with you?
- We can't afford him.

204
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:48,355
Perhaps he could make himself useful
in the kitchen ... Forgive me.

205
00:24:52,192 --> 00:24:54,895
Miss Dashwood ...

206
00:24:56,797 --> 00:25:01,935
Elinor ... I must speak to you.

207
00:25:06,406 --> 00:25:10,511
There is something of
great importance that I need to ...

208
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:17,718
... tell you ...
about my education.

209
00:25:21,388 --> 00:25:25,259
- Your education?
- Yes.

210
00:25:25,425 --> 00:25:31,465
It was conducted.
oddly enough, in Plymouth.

211
00:25:33,333 --> 00:25:38,805
- Do you know it?
- Plymouth? No.

212
00:25:38,939 --> 00:25:43,377
I was four years there.

213
00:25:43,544 --> 00:25:48,182
In a school run by Mr. Pratt.

214
00:25:51,852 --> 00:25:56,924
- Pratt?
- Precisely. Pratt.

215
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:59,393
While I was there ...

216
00:26:00,227 --> 00:26:04,064
That is to say, he had a ...
has a ...

217
00:26:07,734 --> 00:26:11,438
You're needed in London
this instant.

218
00:26:11,605 --> 00:26:17,778
- I'm leaving this afternoon.
- Mamma wishes you to leave at once.

219
00:26:21,114 --> 00:26:24,384
Excuse me.

220
00:26:54,481 --> 00:26:58,485
Edward promised
he would bring the atlas to Barton.

221
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:04,958
I'll wager he will do so
in less than a fortnight.

222
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:08,428
Dear Edward ...

223
00:27:28,182 --> 00:27:31,718
Hello there!

224
00:27:37,691 --> 00:27:40,360
Sir John ...

225
00:27:47,801 --> 00:27:53,774
Dear ladies!
Upon my word! Here you are!

226
00:27:53,907 --> 00:27:59,880
- Sir John, your kindness ...
- None of that! Hush, please!

227
00:28:00,047 --> 00:28:03,884
Here is my dear mamma-in-law,
Mrs. Jennings.

228
00:28:04,051 --> 00:28:10,157
You must be Mrs. Dashwood. Was
Your journey tolerable? Poor souls!

229
00:28:10,324 --> 00:28:13,694
Why did you not
come up to the park first?

230
00:28:13,861 --> 00:28:18,832
- We saw you pass.
- I made John call the carriage.

231
00:28:18,999 --> 00:28:23,704
- She would not wait.
- We have so little company.

232
00:28:23,871 --> 00:28:29,710
I feel as though I know you already.
Delightful creatures!

233
00:28:29,877 --> 00:28:35,883
- You'll dine at Barton Park daily.
- Dear Sir John. we cannot ...

234
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:42,890
No refusals! I'm quite deaf to them.
But I insist!

235
00:28:43,056 --> 00:28:46,894
Let us settle in.
But thank you very much.

236
00:29:11,885 --> 00:29:17,291
Send your man up for the carriage
as soon as you're ready. Goodbye.

237
00:29:17,457 --> 00:29:22,496
Don't thank us.

238
00:29:40,581 --> 00:29:44,318
Your feet are cold.

239
00:30:09,109 --> 00:30:13,547
What have you been doing?
You can grow potatoes in this dirt.

240
00:30:13,714 --> 00:30:18,519
It's cold. I'm cold.

241
00:30:27,861 --> 00:30:32,466
Where can Brandon be?
I hope he's not lamed his horse.

242
00:30:32,633 --> 00:30:37,304
Col. Brandon is the most
eligible bachelor in the county.

243
00:30:37,471 --> 00:30:43,710
He is bound to go for one of you.
He's a better age for Miss Dashwood.

244
00:30:43,877 --> 00:30:48,715
But I dare say she's left her heart
behind in Sussex.

245
00:30:48,882 --> 00:30:54,087
I see you, Miss Marianne! I think
I've unearthed a secret.

246
00:30:54,254 --> 00:30:58,358
You are worse than my best pointer.

247
00:30:59,693 --> 00:31:05,866
Is he a butcher. baker. candlestick
maker? I'll winkle it out of you.

248
00:31:06,033 --> 00:31:12,539
- She's good at winkling.
- We've none of us any secrets here.

249
00:31:12,706 --> 00:31:17,211
Or if we do.
we do not keep them long.

250
00:31:17,377 --> 00:31:22,082
- He's curate of the parish.
- Or perhaps a handsome lieutenant.

251
00:31:22,249 --> 00:31:27,387
- Give us a clue. Is he in uniform?
- He has no profession.

252
00:31:27,554 --> 00:31:30,824
He's a gentleman?

253
00:31:30,958 --> 00:31:38,532
- You know there is no such person.
- There is. His name begins with F.

254
00:31:40,234 --> 00:31:43,504
F? A promising letter.

255
00:31:45,038 --> 00:31:50,544
Foster?
Forrest? Fotheringay? Featherty?

256
00:31:50,711 --> 00:31:54,448
- Fortescue?
- Fondant?

257
00:31:54,615 --> 00:31:58,986
Might I play your pianoforte?

258
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,624
Yes. of course.

259
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:08,929
- We don't stand on ceremony here.
- Please forgive ...

260
00:32:09,096 --> 00:32:14,101
I cannot remember when we last
had a song in the house.

261
00:33:34,882 --> 00:33:39,686
Brandon! Come and meet
our beautiful new neighbours.

262
00:33:39,853 --> 00:33:45,692
What a pity you're late.
You have not heardyour songbird.

263
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:48,195
A great pity.

264
00:33:48,362 --> 00:33:53,267
This is my good friend Col. Brandon.
We served in the East Indies.

265
00:33:53,433 --> 00:33:59,740
- Not a better fellow in the world.
- You've been to the East Indies?

266
00:33:59,907 --> 00:34:03,343
- What's it like?
- Hot.

267
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:07,447
The air is full of spices.

268
00:34:09,082 --> 00:34:14,054
Now. Miss Dashwood.
it's your turn to entertain us.

269
00:34:14,221 --> 00:34:18,892
And I believe I know
what key you will sing in.

270
00:34:19,059 --> 00:34:22,629
F-major ...

271
00:34:34,775 --> 00:34:39,446
You have no right to parade
your ignorant assumptions ...

272
00:34:39,613 --> 00:34:44,384
- You told me.
- I told you nothing.

273
00:34:44,551 --> 00:34:49,122
- They'll meet him when he comes.
- You don't speak of such things.

274
00:34:49,289 --> 00:34:53,460
- Everyone else was.
- Mrs. Jennings is not "everyone".

275
00:34:53,627 --> 00:34:58,765
I like her. She talks about things.
We never talk about things.

276
00:34:58,932 --> 00:35:06,740
If you can say nothing appropriate,
limit your remarks to the weather.

277
00:35:10,978 --> 00:35:15,482
Surely they have enough reeds
for a Moses basket.

278
00:35:52,586 --> 00:35:54,821
You know what they're saying?

279
00:35:54,988 --> 00:36:02,663
Word is, you've developed a taste
for certain company. And why not?

280
00:36:02,829 --> 00:36:07,935
A man like you in his prime ...
She'd be a fortunate young lady.

281
00:36:08,068 --> 00:36:12,639
Marianne Dashwood would
no more think of me than of you.

282
00:36:12,806 --> 00:36:19,012
- Don't think of yourself so meanly.
- And all the better for her.

283
00:36:45,506 --> 00:36:49,476
Besotted ... An excellent match.

284
00:36:49,643 --> 00:36:54,214
- He's rich and she's handsome.
- How long have you known him?

285
00:36:54,381 --> 00:36:59,553
As long as I've been here,
and I came 15 years back.

286
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:04,892
His estate is but four miles hence.
He and John are very thick.

287
00:37:05,058 --> 00:37:10,163
He has no wife and children.
He had a tragic history.

288
00:37:11,098 --> 00:37:17,237
He loved a ward to the family.
They were not permitted to marry.

289
00:37:17,404 --> 00:37:21,074
- On what grounds?
- Eliza was poor.

290
00:37:21,241 --> 00:37:26,647
She was flung out of the house,
and he was packed off to the army.

291
00:37:26,813 --> 00:37:31,084
I think he'd have done himself harm
if not for John.

292
00:37:31,251 --> 00:37:36,356
- What became of the lady?
- She was passed from man to man.

293
00:37:36,523 --> 00:37:40,093
She disappeared from good society.

294
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:44,298
When Brandon returned from India
he searched and searched. -

295
00:37:44,464 --> 00:37:47,734
- only to find her dying
in a poorhouse.

296
00:37:47,901 --> 00:37:54,007
I thought my daughter Charlotte
might have cheered him up.

297
00:37:54,174 --> 00:38:00,447
Look at him now!
So attentive!

298
00:38:01,915 --> 00:38:07,354
- I should try a little experiment.
- Please. Let the colonel alone.

299
00:38:07,554 --> 00:38:11,158
All suitors need a little help.

300
00:38:11,959 --> 00:38:19,600
- We haven't heard you play of late.
- You have a superior musician here.

301
00:38:19,766 --> 00:38:27,374
Brandon shares your passion for
music. He plays the pianoforte well.

302
00:38:27,574 --> 00:38:33,981
You know as many melancholy tunes
as Miss Marianne.

303
00:38:34,147 --> 00:38:39,620
You must play us a duet.
Let us see you both side by side.

304
00:38:39,786 --> 00:38:45,058
I do not know any duets.
Forgive me, Colonel.

305
00:38:50,664 --> 00:38:57,104
Will we never have peace? The rent
is low. but it comes on hard terms.

306
00:38:57,237 --> 00:39:02,142
Mrs. Jennings has nothing to do but
marry off everyone else's daughters.

307
00:39:02,309 --> 00:39:04,811
There's a parcel arrived.

308
00:39:04,978 --> 00:39:08,115
Look!

309
00:39:10,584 --> 00:39:17,024
When is a man safe from such wit.
if infirmity does not protect him?

310
00:39:17,191 --> 00:39:21,395
If he is infirm.
then I am at death's door.

311
00:39:21,562 --> 00:39:28,502
- He complained of rheumatism.
- "A slight ache" was his phrase.

312
00:39:32,539 --> 00:39:36,476
Edward said
he would bring it himself.

313
00:39:38,178 --> 00:39:45,719
"lt gives me great pleasure to
restore this atlas to its owner."

314
00:39:45,886 --> 00:39:52,025
"Business prevents my delivering it,
which will hurt me more than you."

315
00:39:52,192 --> 00:39:56,797
"Memories of your kindness must
sustain me. and I remain -

316
00:39:56,964 --> 00:40:00,267
- your devoted servant,
E.C. Ferrars."

317
00:40:01,335 --> 00:40:07,274
- Why hasn't he come?
- He says he's busy, dear.

318
00:40:07,441 --> 00:40:12,412
- He said he'd come. Why hasn't he?
- I'm taking you for a walk.

319
00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:17,551
- It is going to rain.
- It is not going to rain.

320
00:40:19,186 --> 00:40:24,224
I fear
Mrs. Jennings is a bad influence.

321
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:35,569
- You must miss him. Elinor.
- We are not engaged, Mamma.

322
00:40:36,503 --> 00:40:42,643
- But he loves you, dearest.
- I am by no means assured of that.

323
00:40:42,809 --> 00:40:49,116
And had he such a preference,
there would certainly be obstacles -

324
00:40:49,283 --> 00:40:53,654
- to his marrying a woman of no rank
who cannot afford to buy sugar.

325
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:59,493
- But your heart must tell you ...
- It is better to use one's head.

326
00:41:08,735 --> 00:41:13,207
- It can't be good for me.
- It is. Stop complaining.

327
00:41:13,373 --> 00:41:18,312
- It's giving me a cough.
- It is not giving you a cough.

328
00:41:18,478 --> 00:41:22,449
It's lovely. Come on, catch up!

329
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:29,823
- Over there is a field of rabbits.
- I don't want to see rabbits.

330
00:41:34,862 --> 00:41:40,167
- Is anything superior to this?
- I told you it would rain.

331
00:41:40,334 --> 00:41:44,638
- Blue sky! Let us chase it!
- I'm not supposed to run.

332
00:41:50,944 --> 00:41:54,414
Are you hurt?

333
00:41:55,716 --> 00:42:03,056
- I cannot walk. Run and fetch help.
- I will run as fast as I can.

334
00:42:12,499 --> 00:42:16,703
Margaret!

335
00:42:23,043 --> 00:42:26,880
Don't be afraid. He's quite safe.

336
00:42:30,918 --> 00:42:35,189
- Are you hurt?
- Only my ankle.

337
00:42:35,355 --> 00:42:40,427
May I have your permission to
ascertain if there are any breaks?

338
00:42:58,545 --> 00:43:02,416
It is not broken.

339
00:43:02,583 --> 00:43:06,086
Can you put your arm about my neck?

340
00:43:08,288 --> 00:43:12,326
Allow me to escort you home.

341
00:43:15,896 --> 00:43:18,232
At last!

342
00:43:18,398 --> 00:43:23,737
She fell down and he's carrying her!

343
00:43:23,904 --> 00:43:27,007
Marianne, are you hurt?

344
00:43:27,174 --> 00:43:30,844
It's a twisted ankle.

345
00:43:31,044 --> 00:43:35,015
It's not serious.
I felt the bone. and it's sound.

346
00:43:35,215 --> 00:43:40,153
- I cannot begin to thank you.
- Do not think of it.

347
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:45,092
- Will you not be seated?
- I'd leave a water mark.

348
00:43:45,259 --> 00:43:52,366
- But permit me to call tomorrow.
- We shall look forward to it.

349
00:43:52,566 --> 00:43:55,736
I'll show you out.

350
00:43:55,869 --> 00:43:59,206
Margaret, get the gentleman's hat.

351
00:44:01,441 --> 00:44:07,147
- His name!
- To whom are we so much obliged?

352
00:44:07,314 --> 00:44:10,817
John Willoughby of Allenham
at your service.

353
00:44:10,984 --> 00:44:14,821
John Willoughby of Allenham ...

354
00:44:16,023 --> 00:44:19,226
What an impressive gentleman!

355
00:44:19,426 --> 00:44:24,031
He lifted me as if I weighed no more
than a dried leaf.

356
00:44:24,198 --> 00:44:29,303
- Tell me if I hurt you.
- She feels no pain, Mamma.

357
00:44:29,469 --> 00:44:33,540
Margaret, ask Betsy to make up
a cold compress.

358
00:44:33,707 --> 00:44:37,144
Please don't say anything important.

359
00:44:37,311 --> 00:44:42,816
- He expressed himself well.
- With decorum and honour.

360
00:44:42,983 --> 00:44:48,488
- And spirit and wit and feeling.
- And economy. Ten words at most.

361
00:44:48,655 --> 00:44:52,559
- Change, or you'll catch a cold.
- What care I for colds?

362
00:44:52,726 --> 00:44:58,232
- You'll care when your nose swells.
- You're right. Help me.

363
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:06,006
He's worth catching. Marianne must
not have all the men to herself.

364
00:45:06,173 --> 00:45:12,880
- But what do you know of him?
- There's not a bolder rider.

365
00:45:13,046 --> 00:45:18,051
But what are his tastes.
his passions, his pursuits?

366
00:45:21,955 --> 00:45:28,495
- He has a smart little pointer ...
- Where is Allenham?

367
00:45:28,629 --> 00:45:34,334
Nice little estate three miles east.
He is to inherit it from a relative.

368
00:45:34,468 --> 00:45:37,871
Lady Allen is the name.

369
00:45:43,043 --> 00:45:47,080
It's Col. Brandon.
I should go out and keep watch.

370
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:56,223
You're looking out for Willoughby.
You'll not think of Brandon now.

371
00:45:56,390 --> 00:45:59,026
Come in.

372
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:03,797
Good morning, Brandon.

373
00:46:03,964 --> 00:46:09,703
- How is the invalid?
- Thank you so much, Colonel.

374
00:46:09,837 --> 00:46:16,610
Why set your cap at Willoughby when
you've already made such a conquest?

375
00:46:16,777 --> 00:46:19,913
I'll not set my cap at anyone.

376
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:25,085
- Lady Allen's nephew?
- He visits. for he's to inherit.

377
00:46:26,587 --> 00:46:33,694
He has a pretty estate of his own.
Combe Magna in Somerset.

378
00:46:33,894 --> 00:46:39,867
I'd not give him up to a younger
sister for tumbling down hills.

379
00:46:42,302 --> 00:46:49,943
The man himself. Come. Brandon.
We know when we are not wanted.

380
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:53,947
Thank you so much for calling.

381
00:46:54,815 --> 00:46:58,318
Marianne. the colonel and Sir John
are leaving.

382
00:46:58,485 --> 00:47:02,022
Goodbye.
Thank you for the flowers.

383
00:47:13,033 --> 00:47:19,139
- How do you do, Colonel?
- How do you do, more like.

384
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:42,496
- Mr. Willoughby, what a pleasure!
- The pleasure is all mine.

385
00:47:42,663 --> 00:47:47,901
- Miss Marianne has not caught cold?
- You've found out my name.

386
00:47:48,068 --> 00:47:53,740
The area is crawling with my spies.
You cannot venture out to nature ...

387
00:47:53,907 --> 00:47:58,779
- So nature must be brought to you.
- How beautiful.

388
00:47:58,946 --> 00:48:06,053
- These are not from the hothouse.
- Mine is not the first offering.

389
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:13,093
- They come from an obliging field.
- I always prefer wild flowers.

390
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:17,898
- Would you ..?
-your gratitude is beyond words.

391
00:48:18,065 --> 00:48:26,039
I've grieved for this lonely house.
Then I heard it was taken.

392
00:48:26,206 --> 00:48:32,446
I felt an interest which nothing can
account for but my present delight.

393
00:48:32,613 --> 00:48:36,016
Pray sit, Mr. Willoughby.

394
00:48:36,183 --> 00:48:40,354
Who is reading
Shakespeare's sonnets?

395
00:48:41,889 --> 00:48:45,526
- Marianne is reading them out.
- And which are your favourites?

396
00:48:45,659 --> 00:48:48,896
Mine is 1 16.

397
00:48:49,062 --> 00:48:53,233
"Let me not to the marriage
of true minds admit impediments."

398
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:57,137
"Love is not love which alters
when it alteration finds. -

399
00:48:57,304 --> 00:49:01,441
- or bends with the remover
to remove ..."

400
00:49:01,608 --> 00:49:06,413
- How does it continue?
- "No. it is an ever fixed mark ..."

401
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:12,786
- "That looks on tempests..."
- Is it "tempests"?

402
00:49:14,288 --> 00:49:21,161
It's strange you are reading these.
I carry them with me always.

403
00:49:29,903 --> 00:49:33,574
Until tomorrow then ...

404
00:49:36,143 --> 00:49:41,315
My pocket sonnets are yours.
A talisman against further injury.

405
00:49:41,481 --> 00:49:44,084
Goodbye. Thank you.

406
00:49:49,790 --> 00:49:56,330
Good work. Marianne. You covered
Shakespeare, Scott, poetry.

407
00:49:56,496 --> 00:50:02,870
When you know his views on romance,
you'll have nothing left to talk of.

408
00:50:03,036 --> 00:50:08,876
I suppose I erred against decorum.
I should have talked of the weather.

409
00:50:09,042 --> 00:50:13,480
Mr. Willoughby can be in no doubt
of your enthusiasm for him.

410
00:50:13,647 --> 00:50:16,650
Should I hide my regard?

411
00:50:16,817 --> 00:50:22,956
- No. but we know so little of him.
- Time does not determine intimacy.

412
00:50:23,123 --> 00:50:28,095
Seven years is too little for some,
seven days is enough for others.

413
00:50:28,295 --> 00:50:33,000
- Or seven hours. in this case.
- I feel I know him already.

414
00:50:33,166 --> 00:50:38,438
Had I more shallow feelings, I could
perhaps conceal them as you do.

415
00:50:38,605 --> 00:50:43,377
- I'm sorry ...
- Don't trouble yourself, Marianne.

416
00:50:46,413 --> 00:50:49,483
I do not understand her.

417
00:51:17,945 --> 00:51:20,814
Marianne ...

418
00:51:22,382 --> 00:51:27,754
- Haven't you finished yet?
- No. Patience.

419
00:51:39,566 --> 00:51:43,270
You're not going to deny us
beef as well as sugar?

420
00:51:43,437 --> 00:51:48,442
- There is nothing under ten pence.
- Do you want us to starve?

421
00:51:48,609 --> 00:51:52,646
No.
Just not to eat beef.

422
00:52:35,389 --> 00:52:39,793
If my behaviour was improper,
I should be sensible of it.

423
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:45,766
It has caused impertinent remarks.
Do you not doubt your discretion?

424
00:52:46,834 --> 00:52:53,507
If Mrs. Jennings' remarks prove
impropriety, we are all offending.

425
00:52:53,674 --> 00:52:57,444
Good morning, Colonel.

426
00:52:58,045 --> 00:53:04,384
Miss Dashwood. Miss Marianne.
I come to issue an invitation.

427
00:53:07,554 --> 00:53:11,758
A picnic on my estate
at Delaford.

428
00:53:11,925 --> 00:53:16,597
If you would care to join us
on Thursday next.

429
00:53:16,763 --> 00:53:22,169
Mrs. Jenning's daughter and husband
are travelling up especially.

430
00:53:23,570 --> 00:53:27,608
We should be delighted, Colonel.

431
00:53:27,774 --> 00:53:32,713
I will, of course, be including
Mr. Willoughby in the party.

432
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:37,050
I should be delighted to join you.

433
00:53:40,854 --> 00:53:44,925
Good morning, Miss Dashwood.
Good morning, Colonel.

434
00:53:45,092 --> 00:53:48,295
The colonel has invited us
to Delaford.

435
00:53:48,495 --> 00:53:54,234
- I hear you have a fine pianoforte.
- A Broadwood Grand.

436
00:53:54,401 --> 00:53:59,907
- Then I shall play for you all.
- We shall look forward to it.

437
00:54:12,853 --> 00:54:20,460
- Your sister seems very happy.
- She does not hide her emotions.

438
00:54:20,627 --> 00:54:26,266
Her romantic prejudices
tend to set propriety at naught.

439
00:54:26,433 --> 00:54:32,005
- She is wholly unspoilt.
- Rather too unspoilt.

440
00:54:32,206 --> 00:54:37,477
The sooner she is acquainted with
the ways of the world, the better.

441
00:54:41,281 --> 00:54:46,286
I knew a lady with the same
sweetness of temper -

442
00:54:46,453 --> 00:54:52,125
- who was forced into a
better acquaintance with the world.

443
00:54:52,292 --> 00:54:57,064
The result was only
ruination and despair.

444
00:54:58,131 --> 00:55:02,436
Do not desire it. Miss Dashwood.

445
00:55:04,438 --> 00:55:09,610
Col. Brandon's lawn
is perfect for kite launching.

446
00:55:09,776 --> 00:55:12,479
Mind the pretty ribbons.

447
00:55:14,515 --> 00:55:20,020
Imagine my surprise when Charlotte
and her master appeared with Lucy.

448
00:55:20,187 --> 00:55:23,223
The last person I expected to see.

449
00:55:23,423 --> 00:55:28,462
She came to join in the fun.
There is no such luxury at home.

450
00:55:28,629 --> 00:55:32,332
I'd not seen you for so long.

451
00:55:32,499 --> 00:55:36,603
You sly thing! It was the Dashwoods
she wanted to see.

452
00:55:36,737 --> 00:55:41,408
I've heard nothing but "Dashwood"
for I don't know how long.

453
00:55:41,575 --> 00:55:47,648
What do you think of them? My mother
wrote of little else in her letters.

454
00:55:47,814 --> 00:55:51,985
- Are they not as she described?
- Nothing like.

455
00:55:52,152 --> 00:55:55,255
You are quite rude today.

456
00:55:55,455 --> 00:56:01,662
He's to be an MP. and he is forced
to make everybody like him.

457
00:56:01,828 --> 00:56:07,835
- I said nothing so irrational.
- Mr. Palmer's so droll.

458
00:56:08,001 --> 00:56:12,806
Here he comes!
Now you shall see, Charlotte.

459
00:56:19,246 --> 00:56:22,115
Hello, Mr. Willoughby!

460
00:56:22,316 --> 00:56:26,587
You must meet my daughter Charlotte,
and Mr. Palmer.

461
00:56:26,753 --> 00:56:33,627
- Andyour cousin, Miss Lucy Steele.
- Welcome toyour party.

462
00:56:39,199 --> 00:56:42,236
May I sit beside you?

463
00:56:42,402 --> 00:56:46,607
I've longed to meet you. I've heard
nothing but praise for you.

464
00:56:47,608 --> 00:56:54,314
Sir John and Mrs. Jennings are
too excessive in their compliments.

465
00:56:54,515 --> 00:57:00,220
The praise came from another source.
One not inclined to exaggeration.

466
00:57:00,921 --> 00:57:03,657
What can this be?

467
00:57:14,301 --> 00:57:17,771
Is Col. Brandon here?

468
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:29,650
- My horse!
- What's the matter?

469
00:57:29,816 --> 00:57:33,921
- I must away to London.
- Impossible!

470
00:57:34,087 --> 00:57:39,793
We can't picnic withoutyour host.
Come up to town tomorrow.

471
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:46,500
- Or wait until we return.
- I can't afford to lose one minute.

472
00:57:46,667 --> 00:57:51,605
- Forgive me.
- I hope it's nothing serious.

473
00:57:51,772 --> 00:57:56,176
Upon my soul,
this is all very unusual.

474
00:57:57,978 --> 00:58:04,585
- Frailty, thy name is Brandon.
- Some cannot bear pleasure.

475
00:58:04,718 --> 00:58:09,189
You are a wicked pair.
Col. Brandon will be missed.

476
00:58:09,356 --> 00:58:16,263
Why? Everyone speaks well of him,
but no one remembers to talk to him.

477
00:58:16,396 --> 00:58:20,067
Nonsense. He is highly respected
at Barton Park.

478
00:58:20,234 --> 00:58:25,205
- Which is enough censure in itself.
- Really, Willoughby.

479
00:58:25,372 --> 00:58:30,310
Come, come, Mr. Impudence.
I know your wicked ways.

480
00:58:30,477 --> 00:58:37,150
Reveal your beau. No secrets between
friends. I'll winkle it out of you.

481
00:58:37,317 --> 00:58:44,691
I'll have you married to the colonel
by tea, or I'll swallow my bonnet.

482
00:58:44,858 --> 00:58:49,730
- As if you could marry him.
- Why should you dislike him?

483
00:58:51,365 --> 00:58:55,769
Because he threatened me with rain
when I wanted it fine.

484
00:58:55,936 --> 00:59:02,242
He found fault with my high flyer
and will not buy my brown mare.

485
00:59:02,409 --> 00:59:05,879
If it will be
of satisfaction to you, -

486
00:59:06,046 --> 00:59:11,051
- I believe his character to be. in
all other respects, irreproachable.

487
00:59:11,218 --> 00:59:16,823
In return for this acknowledgement,
don't deny me the privilege -

488
00:59:16,957 --> 00:59:21,595
- of disliking him
as much as I adore ...

489
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:29,269
... this cottage.

490
00:59:29,436 --> 00:59:35,809
- I have plans for improvements.
- That. I will never consent to.

491
00:59:35,976 --> 00:59:40,247
Not a stone must be added
to its walls.

492
00:59:40,414 --> 00:59:45,619
Were I rich enough, I'd rebuild
Combe Magna to this exact image.

493
00:59:45,786 --> 00:59:52,392
- With a fire that smokes?
- Especially the fire that smokes.

494
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:57,598
Then I'd be as happy at Combe
as I've been at Barton.

495
00:59:57,764 --> 01:00:03,504
But this place has one claim on
my affections none other can share.

496
01:00:03,704 --> 01:00:07,007
Promise never to change it.

497
01:00:12,045 --> 01:00:19,019
I'm honoured you risk your honour by
seeing me to the gate unaccompanied.

498
01:00:19,186 --> 01:00:24,725
- That is what Elinor would say.
- And she would be right.

499
01:00:24,858 --> 01:00:30,364
Miss Marianne, will you grant me
an interview tomorrow ... alone?

500
01:00:30,564 --> 01:00:35,135
- Willoughby, we are always alone.
- But there is ...

501
01:00:35,302 --> 01:00:39,506
There is something very particular
I should like to ask you.

502
01:00:39,673 --> 01:00:45,679
Of course. I shall ask Mamma
if I may stay behind from church.

503
01:00:46,813 --> 01:00:50,017
Thank you.

504
01:00:50,184 --> 01:00:53,887
Until tomorrow. then.

505
01:01:07,734 --> 01:01:10,003
Oh. Virtue ...

506
01:01:10,170 --> 01:01:16,310
Silently and with fear, enter the
hearts of all that hear me this day.

507
01:01:16,476 --> 01:01:20,614
Will he kneel down when he asks her?

508
01:01:20,747 --> 01:01:24,218
They always kneel down.

509
01:01:37,531 --> 01:01:40,767
What is wrong, dearest?

510
01:01:40,934 --> 01:01:45,739
Willoughby?
What is the matter?

511
01:01:45,906 --> 01:01:50,744
Forgive me ...
I am sent ...

512
01:01:50,911 --> 01:01:56,350
Lady Allen exercised the privilege
of riches upon a dependent cousin.

513
01:01:56,517 --> 01:02:02,389
- She is sending me to London.
- This morning?

514
01:02:02,556 --> 01:02:08,295
What a disappointment. Your business
won't detain you for long, I hope?

515
01:02:08,495 --> 01:02:14,568
You are kind. but I have no idea of
returning immediately to Devonshire.

516
01:02:14,735 --> 01:02:20,707
- I am invited only once a year.
- Can you wait foryour invitation?

517
01:02:22,543 --> 01:02:30,684
My engagements are of such a
nature ... I dare not flatter my ...

518
01:02:30,817 --> 01:02:36,123
It's folly to linger in this manner.
I will not torment myself further.

519
01:02:36,290 --> 01:02:39,293
Willoughby, come back!

520
01:02:39,459 --> 01:02:43,797
Ask Betsy to make a cup of tea
for Marianne.

521
01:02:43,964 --> 01:02:50,003
- What is wrong, my love?
- Do not ask me questions.

522
01:02:56,243 --> 01:03:00,447
- They must have quarrelled.
- That is unlikely.

523
01:03:01,782 --> 01:03:07,120
Perhaps Lady Allen disapproves
of his regard for Marianne.

524
01:03:07,287 --> 01:03:12,259
- An excuse to send him away.
- Then why did he not say so?

525
01:03:12,426 --> 01:03:16,930
- It's not like him to be secretive.
- What do you suspect?

526
01:03:17,097 --> 01:03:24,471
- Why was his manner so guilty?
- You think he's been acting a part?

527
01:03:24,638 --> 01:03:29,343
- No. He loves her. I am sure.
- Of course!

528
01:03:29,510 --> 01:03:33,514
Has he left her any assurance
of his return?

529
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:36,416
Ask if he proposed.

530
01:03:36,583 --> 01:03:41,788
No! I cannot force a confidence
from Marianne. Neither should you.

531
01:03:41,955 --> 01:03:46,994
We must trust her to confide in us
in her own time.

532
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:50,864
There was something underhand
in his manner.

533
01:03:51,031 --> 01:03:53,667
You will think the worst of him.

534
01:03:53,834 --> 01:03:59,840
I give him the benefit of my
good opinion. He deserves no less.

535
01:04:00,007 --> 01:04:02,843
I am very fond of Willoughby.

536
01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:06,480
Mamma ... Mamma!

537
01:04:10,884 --> 01:04:14,588
She would not let me in.

538
01:04:58,966 --> 01:05:05,439
- If only this rain would stop.
- If only youwould stop.

539
01:05:05,606 --> 01:05:10,844
'Twas you took her off my hands,
Mr. Palmer. A good bargain, too.

540
01:05:10,978 --> 01:05:16,984
Now I have the whip hand over you,
for you cannot give her back.

541
01:05:18,919 --> 01:05:24,224
Marianne, play with us. Looking at
the weather will not bring him back.

542
01:05:24,391 --> 01:05:28,629
- She ate nothing at dinner.
- We're all forlorn these days.

543
01:05:31,131 --> 01:05:36,904
Dear Miss Dashwood, perhaps now
we might haveyour ... discussion.

544
01:05:37,070 --> 01:05:42,109
-your discussion?
- I've longed to ask you something.

545
01:05:42,276 --> 01:05:48,982
You might think me impertinent.
It is an odd question.

546
01:05:49,149 --> 01:05:55,589
If only he'd gone to Combe Magna.
We live but half a mile away.

547
01:05:55,756 --> 01:06:01,261
- Five and a half.
- I cannot believe it is that far.

548
01:06:01,428 --> 01:06:06,533
- I can't believe it.
- Try.

549
01:06:08,135 --> 01:06:14,208
You may ask any manner of question
if that is of any help.

550
01:06:14,374 --> 01:06:16,443
Are you acquainted with your
sister-in-law's mother Mrs. Ferrars?

551
01:06:20,581 --> 01:06:26,787
Fanny's mother?
No. I have never met her.

552
01:06:26,954 --> 01:06:33,594
You must think me strange to ask.
If only I dared tell ...

553
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:39,333
If she tells you of the famous
Mr. F, you must pass it on.

554
01:06:41,268 --> 01:06:45,372
Will you take a turn with me,
Miss Dashwood?

555
01:06:49,042 --> 01:06:54,515
I had no idea you were at all
connected with that family.

556
01:06:54,681 --> 01:06:59,119
I am nothing to Mrs. Ferrars
at present.

557
01:06:59,286 --> 01:07:06,793
But the time may come when we
may be very intimately connected.

558
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:10,397
What do you mean?

559
01:07:12,366 --> 01:07:16,537
Do you have an understanding
with Fanny's brother Robert?

560
01:07:16,703 --> 01:07:22,809
The youngest? No.
I have never met him in my life.

561
01:07:22,976 --> 01:07:28,482
- With Edward.
- Edward Ferrars?

562
01:07:29,516 --> 01:07:34,888
Edward and I have been
secretly engaged these five years.

563
01:07:37,724 --> 01:07:41,361
You may well be surprised.

564
01:07:41,528 --> 01:07:48,101
I only mention it because I entirely
trust you to keepyour secret.

565
01:07:48,268 --> 01:07:53,173
Edward looks on you
quite as his own sister.

566
01:07:54,241 --> 01:07:59,713
I am sorry.
Surely we ...

567
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:04,051
We surely do not mean
the same Mr. Ferrars.

568
01:08:04,218 --> 01:08:10,724
Yes. He was under the tutelage
of my uncle, Mr. Pratt, in Plymouth.

569
01:08:10,891 --> 01:08:16,630
- Has he never spoken of it?
- Yes ... Yes. I believe he has.

570
01:08:19,266 --> 01:08:26,206
I wanted his mother's approval,
but we loved each other so much.

571
01:08:27,808 --> 01:08:35,816
You must have seen how capable he is
of making a woman attached to him.

572
01:08:38,085 --> 01:08:42,256
I cannot pretend it has not
been hard on both of us.

573
01:08:42,422 --> 01:08:47,461
We can scarcely meet
above twice a year.

574
01:08:56,470 --> 01:09:00,574
You seem out of sorts.
Are you quite well?

575
01:09:00,741 --> 01:09:07,080
- I have not offended you?
- I must know what you are saying.

576
01:09:07,247 --> 01:09:14,488
- Promise me you'll not tell a soul.
- Miss Dashwood is quite engrossed.

577
01:09:15,656 --> 01:09:18,425
I give you my word.

578
01:09:18,592 --> 01:09:24,031
- What has so fascinated you?
- Tell us all!

579
01:09:24,198 --> 01:09:31,438
- We were talking of London.
- Do you hear that, Charlotte?

580
01:09:31,605 --> 01:09:36,810
- Charlotte and I concocted a plan.
- The best plan in the world!

581
01:09:36,977 --> 01:09:41,648
I make for London shortly,
and I invite you, Lucy, -

582
01:09:41,815 --> 01:09:46,687
- and both the Misses Dashwood
to join me.

583
01:09:49,189 --> 01:09:52,459
Can I go?

584
01:09:52,626 --> 01:09:58,565
You will all come to my Chelsea home
and taste of the season's delights.

585
01:09:58,732 --> 01:10:01,535
Please, can I go?

586
01:10:01,702 --> 01:10:08,709
- Do you not long for it to be so?
- I came here with no other view.

587
01:10:10,010 --> 01:10:17,651
- We can't leave our mother.
- She can spare you very well.

588
01:10:17,818 --> 01:10:22,723
- Of course she can!
- I could not be more delighted.

589
01:10:22,890 --> 01:10:28,328
I will brook no refusal.
Let us strike hands on the bargain.

590
01:10:28,495 --> 01:10:35,068
If I don't have you married by
Michaelmas, it will not be my fault.

591
01:10:42,910 --> 01:10:46,513
I've never been so grateful.

592
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:52,085
I shall see Willoughby,
and you will see Edward.

593
01:10:52,252 --> 01:10:57,591
- Are you asleep?
- With you in the room?

594
01:10:58,425 --> 01:11:06,099
You can't feel as calm as you look.
Oh, I will never sleep tonight.

595
01:11:06,266 --> 01:11:10,704
What were you and Miss Steele
talking about so long?

596
01:11:10,871 --> 01:11:14,908
Nothing of significance.

597
01:11:31,558 --> 01:11:37,798
How do you think I like poking about
in that big house without Charlotte?

598
01:11:39,633 --> 01:11:44,972
I wrote to Edward, yet I do not know
how much I may see of him.

599
01:11:45,138 --> 01:11:50,677
Secrecy is vital.
He'll never be able to call.

600
01:11:50,878 --> 01:11:55,749
My only comfort has been
the constancy of his affection.

601
01:11:55,916 --> 01:12:00,821
You're fortunate never to have had
any doubts on that score.

602
01:12:00,988 --> 01:12:08,095
I am of a jealous nature. Had he
talked more of one young woman ...

603
01:12:08,262 --> 01:12:13,267
But he's not given a moment's alarm
on that count.

604
01:12:13,433 --> 01:12:18,372
Imagine how glad he'll be
to learn that we are friends.

605
01:12:23,510 --> 01:12:28,282
- Have you missed me, Pigeon?
- Very much, ma'am.

606
01:12:28,448 --> 01:12:34,188
- Is everything in order?
- I suggest the ordering of coal.

607
01:12:34,354 --> 01:12:41,061
There you are, Pooter.
Still alive, I see ... Tea, Pigeon.

608
01:12:41,228 --> 01:12:47,801
You do not waste any time.
Give it to Pigeon.

609
01:12:47,968 --> 01:12:56,677
Mrs. Jennings says your sister will
buy her wedding clothes in town.

610
01:12:57,811 --> 01:13:02,816
John and Fanny are in town.
We should be forced to see them.

611
01:13:11,491 --> 01:13:15,495
I think it was for next door.

612
01:13:15,662 --> 01:13:21,168
Sit down for two seconds.
You're making me nervous.

613
01:13:37,584 --> 01:13:41,355
Oh, Elinor, it is Willoughby.

614
01:13:41,522 --> 01:13:44,725
Indeed it is.

615
01:13:50,631 --> 01:13:53,567
Excuse me. Colonel.

616
01:13:53,734 --> 01:13:56,537
Colonel ...

617
01:13:57,971 --> 01:14:02,943
What a pleasure to see you. Have you
been in London all this while?

618
01:14:03,110 --> 01:14:06,914
What a pleasure to see you. Have you
been in London all this while?

619
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:12,052
I have heard
reports through town ...

620
01:14:13,587 --> 01:14:18,158
Tell me once and for all:

621
01:14:18,358 --> 01:14:22,829
Is everything resolved between
your sister and Mr. Willoughby?

622
01:14:25,766 --> 01:14:31,738
Though neither one has informed me
of their understanding, -

623
01:14:31,905 --> 01:14:37,311
- I have no doubt
of their mutual affection.

624
01:14:37,477 --> 01:14:41,248
Thank you, Miss Dashwood.

625
01:14:41,415 --> 01:14:45,619
To your sister
I wish all imaginable happiness.

626
01:14:45,786 --> 01:14:53,026
To Mr. Willoughby, that
he may endeavour to deserve her.

627
01:14:54,728 --> 01:14:58,198
What do you mean?

628
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:02,536
Forgive me ...

629
01:15:05,405 --> 01:15:08,775
Forgive me.

630
01:15:19,887 --> 01:15:26,193
- Where is dear Edward. John?
- And who is Edward?

631
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:31,331
My brother.
Mr. Edward Ferrars.

632
01:15:31,498 --> 01:15:35,636
Ferrars with an F?

633
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:46,313
Are there any messages?
No message at all? No cards?

634
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:51,852
- You do not ask for your messages.
- No, for I do not expect any.

635
01:15:52,019 --> 01:15:56,056
I have
very little acquaintance in town.

636
01:16:12,439 --> 01:16:18,111
Not another word about the ham bone.
You and Cartwright sort it out.

637
01:16:18,278 --> 01:16:23,917
- No messages.
- Do not fret, my dear.

638
01:16:24,084 --> 01:16:29,122
This good weather is keeping
many a sportsman in the country.

639
01:16:29,289 --> 01:16:34,695
But the frost will soon
drive them to town. Depend on it.

640
01:16:34,862 --> 01:16:38,098
I had not thought of that.

641
01:16:38,265 --> 01:16:41,301
And Miss Dashwood
may set her heart at rest, -

642
01:16:41,468 --> 01:16:47,241
- for your sister-in-law is inviting
Mr. F to the ball tonight.

643
01:16:48,141 --> 01:16:48,675
Do be careful.
the horses have been here.

644
01:16:48,675 --> 01:16:52,479
Do be careful.
the horses have been here.

645
01:16:53,814 --> 01:16:58,552
It is beginning to rain also.
Follow me.

646
01:17:27,347 --> 01:17:31,218
Mamma!
This is very merry!

647
01:17:32,619 --> 01:17:37,691
- Do you spy anyone we know?
- No. Mr. Palmer has a better view.

648
01:17:37,858 --> 01:17:42,829
- Do you see anyone we know?
- Unfortunately not.

649
01:17:42,996 --> 01:17:48,602
How can you be such a tease?
There is Mrs. John Dashwood.

650
01:17:52,139 --> 01:17:55,576
Come along, my dears.

651
01:17:58,078 --> 01:18:00,981
There you are!

652
01:18:01,148 --> 01:18:05,786
How hot it is ...
You are not alone. I trust?

653
01:18:05,953 --> 01:18:10,691
John is just gone
to fetch my brother.

654
01:18:10,858 --> 01:18:17,164
Your brother! I declare.
this is good news, indeed.

655
01:18:17,331 --> 01:18:20,334
I shall faint clean away.

656
01:18:20,501 --> 01:18:25,572
Mrs. Jennings, I am pleased
to meet you. My brother-in-law ...

657
01:18:25,739 --> 01:18:28,008
Mr. Robert Ferrars.

658
01:18:29,576 --> 01:18:33,046
Miss Dashwood.
Miss Steele. Miss Marianne.

659
01:18:34,381 --> 01:18:38,252
My dear ladies, we meet at last.

660
01:18:39,987 --> 01:18:44,191
You must be the younger brother.
Is Mr. Edward not here?

661
01:18:44,358 --> 01:18:49,329
- Miss Dashwood was counting on him.
- He is far too busy.

662
01:18:49,496 --> 01:18:54,835
There's no special acquaintance here
to make his attendance worthwhile.

663
01:18:55,002 --> 01:19:00,541
What are the men about these days?
Are they in hiding?

664
01:19:00,707 --> 01:19:08,148
In the absence of your brother
you must dance with Miss Dashwood.

665
01:19:11,518 --> 01:19:14,521
It would be my honour.

666
01:19:19,793 --> 01:19:26,433
Perhaps Miss Steele might consider
reserving the allemande?

667
01:20:06,139 --> 01:20:11,078
You reside in Devonshire.
Miss Dashwood!

668
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:17,618
- In a cottage!
- Yes.

669
01:20:18,752 --> 01:20:23,924
I am excessively fond of a cottage.

670
01:20:24,091 --> 01:20:29,329
If I had any money to spare,
I should build one myself.

671
01:20:41,141 --> 01:20:43,810
Mr. Willoughby ...

672
01:20:43,977 --> 01:20:47,781
- How do you do, Miss Dashwood?
- Very well.

673
01:20:47,948 --> 01:20:52,719
- How is your family?
- We are all extremely well.

674
01:20:54,288 --> 01:20:57,624
Thank You for your kind inquiry.

675
01:20:59,359 --> 01:21:01,828
Willoughby!

676
01:21:12,639 --> 01:21:15,843
Good God, Willoughby ...

677
01:21:17,778 --> 01:21:21,715
Will you not shake hands with me?

678
01:21:21,882 --> 01:21:25,853
How do you do, Miss Marianne?

679
01:21:27,154 --> 01:21:32,125
What is the matter?
Why have you not come to see me?

680
01:21:32,326 --> 01:21:37,030
Were you not in London?
Have you not received my letters?

681
01:21:37,197 --> 01:21:42,069
I had the pleasure of receiving
the information you sent to me.

682
01:21:44,137 --> 01:21:48,775
For heaven's sake, Willoughby,
tell me what is wrong.

683
01:21:51,078 --> 01:21:54,848
Thank you. I am most obliged.

684
01:21:55,015 --> 01:21:59,686
Excuse me, I must rejoin my party.

685
01:22:19,606 --> 01:22:24,545
Go to him.
Force him to come to me instantly.

686
01:22:24,711 --> 01:22:28,749
You must come away.

687
01:22:30,117 --> 01:22:36,490
- Do you know them?
- Acquaintances from the country.

688
01:22:44,298 --> 01:22:48,502
Come away, dearest.

689
01:22:55,375 --> 01:23:00,280
I do not understand.
I must speak to him ...

690
01:23:00,447 --> 01:23:05,252
My goodness. Come, dear.
You need some air.

691
01:23:17,698 --> 01:23:22,202
Lucy!
We must go.

692
01:23:22,369 --> 01:23:27,608
It would be your pleasure
to escort your young charge home.

693
01:23:27,774 --> 01:23:30,110
How kind.

694
01:23:30,277 --> 01:23:35,482
She actually sent him messages
during the night

695
01:23:46,193 --> 01:23:50,864
- Marianne, please tell me.
- Do not ask me questions.

696
01:23:51,031 --> 01:23:58,305
- You have no confidence in me.
- You confide in no one.

697
01:23:59,506 --> 01:24:04,978
- I have nothing to tell.
- We neither of us do.

698
01:24:05,145 --> 01:24:10,517
I, because I conceal nothing. You,
because you communicate nothing.

699
01:24:16,890 --> 01:24:22,362
Lady Charter is ought to limit her
invitation list. It was very warm.

700
01:24:22,529 --> 01:24:25,732
I am glad we left early.

701
01:24:26,366 --> 01:24:30,504
There now ...

702
01:24:33,507 --> 01:24:39,847
Lovers' quarrels are swift to heal.
That letter will do the trick.

703
01:24:40,013 --> 01:24:46,787
I must be off. I do hope he doesn't
keep her waiting much longer.

704
01:24:46,954 --> 01:24:49,790
It hurts to see her this way.

705
01:24:52,292 --> 01:24:55,896
What a welcome I had
from Edward's family.

706
01:24:56,063 --> 01:25:02,603
You never said how agreeable
your sister-in-law is. Robert, also.

707
01:25:02,769 --> 01:25:08,475
It is fortunate that none of them
knows of your engagement.

708
01:25:17,050 --> 01:25:24,157
"'Dear Madam. I am at a loss to see
how I might have offended you."

709
01:25:24,358 --> 01:25:29,997
"lf I have given rise to a belief of
more than I meant to express, -

710
01:25:30,163 --> 01:25:34,067
- I regret
not having been more guarded."

711
01:25:34,234 --> 01:25:37,237
"My affections
are engaged elsewhere."

712
01:25:37,404 --> 01:25:43,277
"It is with regret that I return
your letters and the lock of hair."

713
01:25:43,443 --> 01:25:48,248
"l am, et cetera, John Willoughby."

714
01:25:50,317 --> 01:25:53,253
Dearest ...

715
01:25:55,155 --> 01:26:02,963
It is better than if your engagement
had carried on before he ended it.

716
01:26:03,130 --> 01:26:05,966
We're not engaged.

717
01:26:06,133 --> 01:26:11,004
I thought he left you
with some kind of understanding.

718
01:26:11,171 --> 01:26:18,278
- He's not so unworthy as you think.
- Did he tell you that he loved you?

719
01:26:18,445 --> 01:26:27,154
Yes. No ... Never absolutely.
It was implied but never declared.

720
01:26:27,321 --> 01:26:32,392
Sometimes I thought it had been,
but it never was. He broke no vow.

721
01:26:32,559 --> 01:26:37,197
He made us all believe he loved you.

722
01:26:37,364 --> 01:26:43,237
He did! He loved me as I loved him.

723
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:51,144
I had to come straight up.
How are you, Miss Marianne?

724
01:26:51,311 --> 01:26:56,083
Poor thing, she looks very bad.
No wonder. for it is but too true.

725
01:26:56,250 --> 01:26:59,820
I was told by Miss Morton, -

726
01:26:59,987 --> 01:27:04,591
- that he is soon to marry
a Miss Grey with 50,000!

727
01:27:05,592 --> 01:27:11,365
If true, he is a good-for-nothing
who used my young friend ill.

728
01:27:11,532 --> 01:27:16,837
And I wish with all my soul that his
wife might plague all his heart out.

729
01:27:17,004 --> 01:27:22,075
He's not the only young man
worth having.

730
01:27:22,242 --> 01:27:26,513
With your pretty face
You'll never want for admirers.

731
01:27:29,583 --> 01:27:34,555
Better let her have her cry out
and have done with it.

732
01:27:34,721 --> 01:27:39,293
I will go look out something
to tempt her.

733
01:27:39,459 --> 01:27:44,798
- Does she care for olives?
- I cannot tell you.

734
01:27:52,306 --> 01:27:55,275
Apparently, they never were engaged.

735
01:27:55,442 --> 01:27:59,913
Miss Grey has 50,000.
Marianne is virtually penniless.

736
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:05,052
She couldn't expect him to go
through with it. But I feel for her.

737
01:28:05,185 --> 01:28:09,456
She will lose her bloom
and end a spinster like Elinor.

738
01:28:09,623 --> 01:28:16,730
We might have them to stay for a
few days. We are, after all, family.

739
01:28:16,897 --> 01:28:20,234
- And my father ...
- My love ...

740
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:25,405
I would ask them with all my heart,
but I've already asked Miss Steele.

741
01:28:25,572 --> 01:28:29,743
And we cannot deprive Mrs. Jennings
of all her company.

742
01:28:29,910 --> 01:28:33,113
We can invite your sisters
some other year.

743
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:38,619
Miss Steele will profit more
from your generosity, poor girl.

744
01:28:38,785 --> 01:28:41,688
Excellent notion.

745
01:28:45,759 --> 01:28:48,228
Colonel Brandon to see you.

746
01:28:48,862 --> 01:28:56,270
- Thank you so much for coming.
- How is your sister?

747
01:28:56,436 --> 01:29:03,544
I must get her home. Palmer can take
us to Cleveland, a day from Barton.

748
01:29:03,710 --> 01:29:11,718
- I'll take you to Barton myself.
- I confess, that is what I hoped.

749
01:29:11,885 --> 01:29:15,656
Marianne suffers cruelly.

750
01:29:15,822 --> 01:29:23,063
What pains me most is how hard
she tries to justify Mr. Willoughby.

751
01:29:26,366 --> 01:29:29,903
Perhaps ...

752
01:29:31,305 --> 01:29:37,377
Ma I relate some circumstances
which only a desire to be useful ...

753
01:29:37,544 --> 01:29:41,882
You have something to tell me
of Mr. Willoughby?

754
01:29:51,191 --> 01:29:54,995
When I quitted Barton last ...

755
01:29:55,162 --> 01:29:58,966
No, I must go further back.

756
01:29:59,166 --> 01:30:03,937
No doubt ...
No doubt ...

757
01:30:04,137 --> 01:30:08,742
... Mrs. Jennings has appraised you
of certain events in my past.

758
01:30:08,909 --> 01:30:15,182
The sad outcome of my connection
with a young woman named Eliza.

759
01:30:17,184 --> 01:30:21,088
What is not commonly known -

760
01:30:21,255 --> 01:30:27,294
- is that 20 years ago,
before she died. Eliza bore a child.

761
01:30:27,461 --> 01:30:31,598
The father. whoever he was.
abandoned them.

762
01:30:31,765 --> 01:30:37,905
As Eliza lay dying, she begged me
to look after the child.

763
01:30:38,071 --> 01:30:43,544
I had failed her in ever other way,
I could not refuse her now.

764
01:30:43,710 --> 01:30:48,916
I placed the child, Beth,
with a family in the country -

765
01:30:49,082 --> 01:30:54,555
- where I knew she would be looked
after. I saw her whenever I could.

766
01:30:54,721 --> 01:30:58,125
She grew up so headstrong, -

767
01:30:58,292 --> 01:31:04,731
- and, God forgive me,
I allowed her too much freedom.

768
01:31:04,898 --> 01:31:08,235
Almost a year ago she disappeared.

769
01:31:08,402 --> 01:31:13,106
I instigated a search, but for
eight months I imagined the worst.

770
01:31:13,273 --> 01:31:18,979
On the day of the Delaford picnic,
I received the first news of her.

771
01:31:20,180 --> 01:31:24,484
She was ... with child.

772
01:31:24,651 --> 01:31:30,490
And the blackguard who had left her
with no hint of his whereabouts ...

773
01:31:36,697 --> 01:31:40,767
Do you mean Willoughby?

774
01:31:42,636 --> 01:31:48,509
Before I could confront him.
Lady Allen had turned him out.

775
01:31:48,675 --> 01:31:53,447
- He fled to London.
- He left without any explanation.

776
01:31:53,614 --> 01:32:01,021
He risked losing the estate, and the
money that remained to his debtors.

777
01:32:01,188 --> 01:32:05,392
So he abandoned Marianne -

778
01:32:05,559 --> 01:32:10,130
- for Miss Grey
and her 50.000.

779
01:32:12,466 --> 01:32:15,335
Is Beth still in town?

780
01:32:16,003 --> 01:32:20,207
She has chosen to go to the country
for her confinement.

781
01:32:27,314 --> 01:32:32,186
I would not burden you,
had I not, from my heart, -

782
01:32:32,352 --> 01:32:37,558
- believed it might, in time,
lessen our sister's regrets.

783
01:32:47,501 --> 01:32:53,674
I have described Mr. Willoughby
as the worst of libertines.

784
01:32:53,841 --> 01:32:59,279
But I learned from Lady Allen that
he did mean to propose that day.

785
01:32:59,446 --> 01:33:07,221
I cannot deny that his intentions
towards Marianne were honourable.

786
01:33:09,122 --> 01:33:14,428
I feel certain
that he would have married her.

787
01:33:14,595 --> 01:33:18,632
- Had it not been ...
- For the money.

788
01:33:24,204 --> 01:33:29,409
- Was I right to tell you?
- Of course.

789
01:33:31,745 --> 01:33:36,483
Whatever his past actions,
whatever his present course, -

790
01:33:36,650 --> 01:33:41,321
- you may be certain
that he loved you.

791
01:33:41,488 --> 01:33:44,958
But not enough.

792
01:33:45,125 --> 01:33:48,295
Not enough ...

793
01:33:56,270 --> 01:33:59,973
Here is someone to cheer you up.

794
01:34:02,609 --> 01:34:08,982
How is your dear sister?
Poor thing.

795
01:34:09,149 --> 01:34:14,154
I do not know what I'd do if a man
treated me with so little respect.

796
01:34:14,321 --> 01:34:17,958
Are you enjoying your stay
with John and Fanny?

797
01:34:18,125 --> 01:34:24,298
I was never so happy in my life.
Your sister-in-law has taken to me.

798
01:34:24,464 --> 01:34:29,469
- You cannot imagine what happened.
- No. I cannot.

799
01:34:29,636 --> 01:34:37,010
Yesterday I was introduced to his
mother. She was more than civil.

800
01:34:37,177 --> 01:34:43,016
I have not yet seen Edward,
but I feel sure to, very soon.

801
01:34:45,986 --> 01:34:50,757
There is a Mr. Edward Ferrars
to see you.

802
01:34:54,461 --> 01:34:57,631
Do ask him to come in.

803
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:39,373
What a pleasure to see you.
You know Miss Steele. of course.

804
01:35:43,744 --> 01:35:50,817
- How do you do, Miss Steele?
- I am well, thank you.

805
01:35:52,619 --> 01:35:56,456
Do sit down.

806
01:36:01,061 --> 01:36:06,934
Are you surprised to find me here
and not at your sister's house?

807
01:36:08,769 --> 01:36:13,874
Let me fetch Marianne. She would be
disappointed to miss you.

808
01:36:15,075 --> 01:36:18,912
Edward! I heard your voice.

809
01:36:19,079 --> 01:36:25,452
- At last you found us.
- My visit is shamefully overdue.

810
01:36:25,619 --> 01:36:31,658
- You're pale. Are you not well?
- Don't think of me. Elinor is well.

811
01:36:31,825 --> 01:36:38,265
- That is enough for both of us.
- How do you enjoy London?

812
01:36:38,432 --> 01:36:45,339
The sight of you is all the pleasure
it has afforded. Is that not so?

813
01:36:47,007 --> 01:36:52,145
- Why have you not visited before?
- I have been engaged elsewhere.

814
01:36:52,312 --> 01:36:57,084
But what was that when there were
such friends to be met?

815
01:36:57,251 --> 01:37:02,155
Perhaps you think young men
never honour their engagements

816
01:37:02,322 --> 01:37:07,461
Edward is the most incapable of
being selfish of anyone I ever saw.

817
01:37:10,330 --> 01:37:17,037
Edward, will you not sit?
Help me to persuade him.

818
01:37:24,678 --> 01:37:30,017
- Forgive me. I must take m leave.
- You are only just arrived.

819
01:37:30,184 --> 01:37:33,487
I've an urgent commission for Fanny.

820
01:37:33,654 --> 01:37:37,791
Perhaps you might escort me
back to your sister's house.

821
01:37:40,827 --> 01:37:44,665
It would be an honour.

822
01:38:03,217 --> 01:38:09,489
- Why did you not urge him to stay?
- He must have had his reasons.

823
01:38:09,656 --> 01:38:16,730
Yes, your coldness. Were I Edward,
I'd assume you didn't care for me.

824
01:38:20,267 --> 01:38:27,007
Marianne looked badly. It makes me
fear that I shall never marry.

825
01:38:27,174 --> 01:38:32,045
Nonsense. You will marry far better
than the Dashwood girls.

826
01:38:32,212 --> 01:38:35,449
But I have no dowry.

827
01:38:35,616 --> 01:38:41,255
There are other important qualities
that you have in abundance.

828
01:38:41,421 --> 01:38:46,793
It would not surprise me if you
married beyond your expectations.

829
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:50,998
Oh, I wish that might be so.

830
01:38:51,131 --> 01:38:55,302
There is a young man ...

831
01:38:55,469 --> 01:38:59,640
Is he of good fortune and breeding?

832
01:38:59,806 --> 01:39:05,579
Of both. But his family
would certainly oppose the match.

833
01:39:05,746 --> 01:39:10,450
They will allow it
as soon as they see you.

834
01:39:10,617 --> 01:39:13,453
It is a very great secret.

835
01:39:13,620 --> 01:39:18,759
I've told nobody in the world
for fear of discovery.

836
01:39:18,926 --> 01:39:25,265
- I am the soul of discretion.
- If I dared tell ...

837
01:39:26,967 --> 01:39:32,339
I can assure you,
I am as silent as the grave.

838
01:39:39,179 --> 01:39:43,183
Viper in my bosom!

839
01:39:45,752 --> 01:39:49,523
Stop this!

840
01:40:04,505 --> 01:40:11,612
What a commotion! Edward Ferrars.
the one I used to joke you about, -

841
01:40:11,778 --> 01:40:16,950
- is engaged these five years
to Lucy Steele.

842
01:40:17,117 --> 01:40:24,858
His mother has demanded he break the
engagement or suffer disinheritance.

843
01:40:25,025 --> 01:40:30,364
But he refuses to break his promise.
He has stood by her, -

844
01:40:30,531 --> 01:40:36,570
- and is cut off without a penny.
She settled it all on Mr. Robert.

845
01:40:36,737 --> 01:40:43,477
I must find Lucy. Your sister-in-law
drove her to hysteria.

846
01:40:45,312 --> 01:40:49,383
How long have you known?

847
01:40:51,618 --> 01:40:56,924
- Since Mrs. Jennings invited us.
- Why did you not tell me?

848
01:40:57,090 --> 01:41:00,327
Lucy told me in confidence.

849
01:41:00,494 --> 01:41:04,398
- I could not break my word.
- He loves you!

850
01:41:04,565 --> 01:41:09,837
- He tried to tell me about Lucy.
- He cannot marry her.

851
01:41:11,205 --> 01:41:15,776
Should he treat her worse
than Willoughby treated you?

852
01:41:15,943 --> 01:41:22,549
- He can't marry without love.
- He promised a long time ago.

853
01:41:22,716 --> 01:41:31,291
He may harbour some regret, but he
he will be happy he kept his word.

854
01:41:31,458 --> 01:41:39,800
It is bewitching to think one's
happiness depends on one person, -

855
01:41:39,967 --> 01:41:44,638
- but it is not always possible.
We must accept.

856
01:41:44,838 --> 01:41:50,310
Edward will marry Lucy,
and you and I will go home.

857
01:41:50,477 --> 01:41:53,447
Always resignation and acceptance.

858
01:41:54,248 --> 01:41:57,818
Always prudence and honour and duty.

859
01:41:58,018 --> 01:42:01,488
Elinor, where is your heart?

860
01:42:02,155 --> 01:42:06,660
What do you know of my heart,
or anything but your own suffering?

861
01:42:06,827 --> 01:42:11,999
For weeks this has been pressed
on me, when I could not speak of it.

862
01:42:12,165 --> 01:42:19,173
Forced on me by the person whose
prior claims ruined all my hopes.

863
01:42:19,339 --> 01:42:24,311
I endured her exaltation, knowing
I was divided from Edward forever.

864
01:42:24,478 --> 01:42:30,184
If not bound to silence. I'd have
produced proof of a broken heart.

865
01:42:57,444 --> 01:43:04,952
I have heard your Mr. Ferrars
has lost his fortune to his brother.

866
01:43:05,118 --> 01:43:10,624
- Have I been rightly informed?
- It is indeed so.

867
01:43:10,791 --> 01:43:18,332
- Are you acquainted with him?
- No. we have never met.

868
01:43:18,498 --> 01:43:23,370
But I know only too well
the cruelty ...

869
01:43:23,537 --> 01:43:29,810
... of dividing two young people
long attached to one another.

870
01:43:32,513 --> 01:43:38,519
I have a proposal that may allow him
to marry Miss Steele immediately.

871
01:43:38,685 --> 01:43:43,490
As he is a friend to your family,
perhaps you'd mention it to him.

872
01:43:45,859 --> 01:43:52,599
I'm sure he'd be delighted
to hear it from your own lips.

873
01:43:54,234 --> 01:43:57,271
I think not.

874
01:43:57,437 --> 01:44:04,011
His behaviour has proved him proud.
In the best sense.

875
01:44:04,178 --> 01:44:08,215
I feel certain
this is the right course.

876
01:44:14,988 --> 01:44:18,192
Mr. Edward Ferrars.

877
01:44:27,968 --> 01:44:31,104
Thank you for responding so quickly.

878
01:44:31,271 --> 01:44:35,242
I was grateful
to receive your message.

879
01:44:35,409 --> 01:44:38,545
God knows what you must think of me.

880
01:44:38,712 --> 01:44:43,717
- I have no right to speak...
- I have good news.

881
01:44:43,884 --> 01:44:46,887
Do please sit down.

882
01:44:51,792 --> 01:44:57,231
- You know of Col. Brandon.
- I've heard his name.

883
01:44:57,397 --> 01:45:03,504
Col. Brandon desires me to say,
as you wish to join the clergy, -

884
01:45:03,670 --> 01:45:09,510
- that he has pleasure in offering
you the parish at Delaford, -

885
01:45:09,676 --> 01:45:14,114
- in the hope it may enable
you and Miss Steele to marry.

886
01:45:15,482 --> 01:45:19,086
- Col. Brandon!
- Yes.

887
01:45:19,253 --> 01:45:26,093
He means it as testimony of his
concern for this cruel situation.

888
01:45:27,628 --> 01:45:31,164
Col. Brandon give me a parish!

889
01:45:32,266 --> 01:45:35,936
Can it be possible?

890
01:45:36,103 --> 01:45:42,776
You shouldn't be astonished to find
friendship outside your family.

891
01:45:42,943 --> 01:45:48,649
No.
Not to find it in you.

892
01:45:48,815 --> 01:45:53,887
I cannot be ignorant that it is
certainly to you that I owe this.

893
01:45:54,087 --> 01:45:58,158
I'd express it if I could,
but I am no orator ...

894
01:45:58,325 --> 01:46:04,464
You are mistaken.
You owe it to your own merit.

895
01:46:08,869 --> 01:46:13,240
Col. Brandon must be a man
of great worth.

896
01:46:13,407 --> 01:46:17,878
He is the kindest and best of men.

897
01:46:19,913 --> 01:46:25,385
May I ask why the colonel
did not tell me himself?

898
01:46:25,552 --> 01:46:31,258
I think he felt it would be better
coming from a friend.

899
01:46:35,696 --> 01:46:41,168
Your friendship has been
the most important in my life.

900
01:46:44,538 --> 01:46:48,208
You will always have it.

901
01:46:52,012 --> 01:46:55,315
Forgive me.

902
01:46:55,516 --> 01:47:00,754
You honour your promises. That is
more important than anything else.

903
01:47:00,921 --> 01:47:05,392
I wish you both happiness.

904
01:47:45,098 --> 01:47:49,236
What luck for them
to find a parish so close to Barton.

905
01:47:49,403 --> 01:47:53,640
You'll all be able to meet
very often.

906
01:47:53,807 --> 01:47:58,745
I've never disliked a person so much
as I do Mr. Willoughby.

907
01:47:58,912 --> 01:48:06,420
We can see his house from the hill!
I'll ask Jackson to plant trees.

908
01:48:06,587 --> 01:48:08,689
You won't.

909
01:48:08,856 --> 01:48:13,794
I hear Miss Grey's bridal gown
was everything of the finest ...

910
01:48:25,706 --> 01:48:31,612
Mrs. Bunting!
We're in desperate need of tea.

911
01:48:39,019 --> 01:48:43,957
She's not drawn breath since London.
Had I only found another way home.

912
01:48:44,124 --> 01:48:50,664
There was no other way. I'll just
take a stroll. A moment's peace.

913
01:48:50,831 --> 01:48:55,536
- I think it is going to rain.
- No. it will not rain.

914
01:48:55,702 --> 01:49:01,742
- When you say so, it always does.
- I shall keep to the garden.

915
01:49:21,428 --> 01:49:30,704
We are very proud of your Thomas.
His papa has such a way with him.

916
01:49:42,382 --> 01:49:47,921
Oh, there you are.
Come and meet little Thomas.

917
01:50:03,537 --> 01:50:06,974
I cannot see Marianne.

918
01:50:45,245 --> 01:50:52,152
Love is not love which alters
when it alteration finds. -

919
01:50:52,319 --> 01:50:57,691
- or bends with the remover
to remove.

920
01:50:57,858 --> 01:51:03,096
Oh. no. It is an ever fixed mark -

921
01:51:03,263 --> 01:51:08,001
- that looks on tempests
and is never shaken.

922
01:51:10,170 --> 01:51:13,207
Willoughby ...

923
01:51:14,675 --> 01:51:17,778
Willoughby ...

924
01:51:17,945 --> 01:51:21,014
Willoughby ...

925
01:51:24,852 --> 01:51:26,954
Marianne!

926
01:51:27,120 --> 01:51:33,827
- She'll be wet through.
- Thank you for pointing that out.

927
01:51:33,994 --> 01:51:37,898
Do not worry, Miss Dashwood.
Brandon will find her.

928
01:51:38,098 --> 01:51:42,903
We can all guess where she went.

929
01:52:11,732 --> 01:52:15,836
She's not hurt.
but we must get her warm.

930
01:52:16,003 --> 01:52:21,108
There is a fire lit in my room.
Do hurry!

931
01:52:48,735 --> 01:52:52,773
I think Marianne may need
a doctor.

932
01:53:11,992 --> 01:53:19,066
You'll wear yourself out. A day or
two in bed will set her to rights.

933
01:53:19,233 --> 01:53:25,672
You can rely upon Harris, Colonel.
I've never found a better physician.

934
01:53:25,839 --> 01:53:33,146
- What is the diagnosis?
- It is an infectious fever.

935
01:53:33,313 --> 01:53:39,419
- I recommend removing your child.
- Mrs. Bunting!

936
01:53:47,528 --> 01:53:53,200
Miss Dashwood ...
I am more sorry than I can say.

937
01:53:53,367 --> 01:53:59,173
- If you prefer me to stay I shall.
- That is very kind.

938
01:53:59,339 --> 01:54:03,644
But Col. Brandon and Dr. Harris
will look after us.

939
01:54:03,810 --> 01:54:07,214
Thank you for all you have done.

940
01:54:35,409 --> 01:54:39,913
She's not doing as well
as I would like.

941
01:54:53,427 --> 01:54:56,697
What can I do?

942
01:54:58,098 --> 01:55:04,538
- You've done so much already.
- Anything, or I shall run mad.

943
01:55:04,705 --> 01:55:09,109
She would be easier
if her mother were here.

944
01:55:53,153 --> 01:55:56,290
I must fetch more laudanum.

945
01:55:56,456 --> 01:56:03,230
I cannot pretend that your sister's
condition is not very serious.

946
01:56:07,734 --> 01:56:11,071
You must prepare yourself.

947
01:56:11,238 --> 01:56:14,908
I will return shortly.

948
01:56:31,358 --> 01:56:34,027
Marianne ...

949
01:56:34,228 --> 01:56:37,664
Marianne, please try ...

950
01:56:39,600 --> 01:56:42,202
Marianne ...

951
01:56:44,438 --> 01:56:48,542
Please try ...

952
01:56:59,052 --> 01:57:04,525
I cannot ...
I cannot do without you.

953
01:57:12,266 --> 01:57:17,971
I've tried to bear everything else.
I will try ...

954
01:57:19,173 --> 01:57:23,043
But please, dearest ...

955
01:57:27,014 --> 01:57:29,983
... beloved Marianne ...

956
01:57:33,687 --> 01:57:37,691
... do not leave me alone.

957
01:58:31,979 --> 01:58:34,481
Elinor ...

958
01:59:00,073 --> 01:59:02,142
My mother ...

959
01:59:11,618 --> 01:59:16,290
She is out of danger.
She is out of danger.

960
01:59:28,869 --> 01:59:32,172
- Where is Elinor?
- I'm here.

961
01:59:32,339 --> 01:59:35,576
Dearest. I am here.

962
01:59:39,813 --> 01:59:43,317
Col. Brandon ...

963
01:59:49,990 --> 01:59:53,894
Thank you.

964
02:00:34,601 --> 02:00:41,208
He's not so dashing as Willoughby,
but he has a pleasing countenance.

965
02:00:41,375 --> 02:00:47,281
There was something in Willoughby's
eyes at times that I did not like.

966
02:00:51,518 --> 02:00:55,222
"Nor is the earth the lesse.
or loseth aught."

967
02:00:55,389 --> 02:01:03,397
"What from one place doth fall is
with the tide to another brought."

968
02:01:03,564 --> 02:01:10,204
"For there is nothing lost
but may be found ...

969
02:01:10,370 --> 02:01:14,408
... if sought."

970
02:01:17,444 --> 02:01:22,616
- Shall we continue tomorrow?
- No, for I must away.

971
02:01:22,783 --> 02:01:29,089
- Away! Where?
- That I cannot tell you.

972
02:01:29,256 --> 02:01:32,993
It is a secret.

973
02:01:35,128 --> 02:01:39,333
You will not stay away long

974
02:01:55,482 --> 02:01:58,485
There.

975
02:01:59,586 --> 02:02:05,192
There I fell.
and there I first saw Willoughby.

976
02:02:05,359 --> 02:02:10,430
Poor Willoughby.
He will always regret you.

977
02:02:10,597 --> 02:02:16,203
Does it follow that. had he chosen
me he would have been content

978
02:02:16,370 --> 02:02:20,941
He would have had a wife he loved.
but no money, -

979
02:02:21,108 --> 02:02:28,048
- and might have learned to rank
his Pocketbook above his heart.

980
02:02:31,018 --> 02:02:36,690
If his regrets are half as painful
as mine, he will suffer enough.

981
02:02:36,857 --> 02:02:42,796
Do you compare
your conduct with his?

982
02:02:42,963 --> 02:02:49,403
I compare it to what it
ought to have been. With yours.

983
02:03:02,349 --> 02:03:05,853
I fetched those beef fillets. Ma'am.

984
02:03:06,019 --> 02:03:12,125
Beef is less expensive in Exeter.
Anyway, it's for Marianne.

985
02:03:12,326 --> 02:03:16,196
- Was Exeter crowded?
- It was. Ma'am.

986
02:03:16,363 --> 02:03:22,069
Miss Pothington
has had another stroke.

987
02:03:22,236 --> 02:03:26,406
And Miss Murden has turned away
Coles for his drunkenness.

988
02:03:26,573 --> 02:03:32,112
And Mr. Ferrars is married.
but of course you know that.

989
02:03:35,182 --> 02:03:38,185
Who told you he was married?

990
02:03:38,352 --> 02:03:46,093
I saw Mrs. Ferrars myself. She and
Mr. Ferrars stopped at the inn.

991
02:03:46,260 --> 02:03:50,864
I saw it was Miss Steele.
so I took off my hat.

992
02:03:51,031 --> 02:03:55,802
She inquired after all of you,
especially Miss Dashwood.

993
02:03:55,969 --> 02:04:03,944
She bade me give their compliments.
They're sending a piece of the cake.

994
02:04:05,212 --> 02:04:10,751
- Did Mrs. Ferrars seem well?
- She said she was vastly contented.

995
02:04:10,918 --> 02:04:16,089
As she was always an affable lady,
I made free to wish her joy.

996
02:04:16,256 --> 02:04:19,593
Thank you, Thomas.

997
02:04:50,624 --> 02:04:54,962
- What is it. Thomas!
- I'm not sure, but it's heavy.

998
02:04:55,662 --> 02:05:01,635
"It is small enough for the parlour.
When I follow shortly, I expect -

999
02:05:01,802 --> 02:05:07,474
- that you've learnt the enclosed.
Your friend, Christopher Brandon."

1000
02:05:07,641 --> 02:05:11,178
It fits perfectly.

1001
02:05:11,512 --> 02:05:14,681
Here you are, Miss Marianne.

1002
02:05:14,848 --> 02:05:17,618
Fetch some tea.

1003
02:05:17,784 --> 02:05:24,258
- He must like you very much.
- It's for all of us.

1004
02:06:12,005 --> 02:06:15,242
Here is Col. Brandon.

1005
02:06:25,118 --> 02:06:32,025
- I do not think it is the colonel.
- He said he would arrive today.

1006
02:06:32,793 --> 02:06:35,629
Edward!

1007
02:06:35,796 --> 02:06:38,799
It is Edward!

1008
02:06:40,734 --> 02:06:44,471
Calm.
We must be calm.

1009
02:07:05,459 --> 02:07:08,395
Mr. Ferrars for you, ma'am.

1010
02:07:12,299 --> 02:07:16,737
Edward ...
What a pleasure to see you.

1011
02:07:33,787 --> 02:07:40,427
- I trust I find you all well
- Thank you. We are all very well.

1012
02:07:45,165 --> 02:07:50,537
We've been enjoying fine weather ...
Well. we have .

1013
02:07:51,839 --> 02:07:57,945
I'm glad to hear it.
The roads were very dry.

1014
02:08:01,682 --> 02:08:07,454
I wish you great joy, Edward.

1015
02:08:24,238 --> 02:08:29,042
I hope
you have left Mrs. Ferrars well.

1016
02:08:30,344 --> 02:08:34,748
Tolerably ... Thank you.

1017
02:08:38,418 --> 02:08:42,723
Is Mrs. Ferrars at the new Parish?

1018
02:08:42,890 --> 02:08:47,060
No ... my mother is in town.

1019
02:08:47,227 --> 02:08:50,898
I meant Mrs. Edward Ferrars.

1020
02:08:54,234 --> 02:08:58,338
You've not heard?

1021
02:09:00,407 --> 02:09:04,545
I think you mean my brother.
Mrs. Robert Ferrars.

1022
02:09:07,080 --> 02:09:11,318
- Mrs. Robert Ferrars?
- Yes.

1023
02:09:12,786 --> 02:09:18,926
I received a letter
from Miss Steele. -

1024
02:09:19,092 --> 02:09:25,933
- or Mrs. Ferrars, I should say,
communicating to me -

1025
02:09:26,099 --> 02:09:31,438
- the transfer of her affections
to my brother Robert.

1026
02:09:31,605 --> 02:09:36,210
It seems they were much
thrown together in London.

1027
02:09:36,376 --> 02:09:42,749
In view of my new circumstances
I felt it only right -

1028
02:09:42,916 --> 02:09:47,487
- that she be released
from our engagement.

1029
02:09:47,688 --> 02:09:52,726
At any rate, they were married
last week in Plymouth.

1030
02:09:57,965 --> 02:10:01,134
Then you ...

1031
02:10:02,769 --> 02:10:05,939
... are not married?

1032
02:10:06,106 --> 02:10:09,977
No.

1033
02:10:36,303 --> 02:10:42,209
Elinor ...
I met Lucy when I was very young.

1034
02:10:42,376 --> 02:10:48,982
Had I had a profession, I would not
have felt such an idle inclination.

1035
02:10:49,149 --> 02:10:55,889
At Norland, I convinced myself that
you felt only friendship for me, -

1036
02:10:56,056 --> 02:11:00,060
- and that it was my heart alone
that I was risking.

1037
02:11:00,227 --> 02:11:07,134
I have come with no expectations,
only to express, now I am able, -

1038
02:11:08,702 --> 02:11:14,675
- that my heart is,
and always will be ...

1039
02:11:16,410 --> 02:11:19,980
... yours.

1040
02:11:33,026 --> 02:11:38,932
- He's sitting next to her.
- What else?

1041
02:11:39,099 --> 02:11:41,935
Tell us!

1042
02:11:42,102 --> 02:11:46,039
He's kneeling down!
