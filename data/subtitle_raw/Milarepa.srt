1
00:01:58,733 --> 00:02:01,395
Excellent,
my wife has given birth to a son.

2
00:02:01,603 --> 00:02:02,900
Very good...

3
00:02:03,471 --> 00:02:05,871
This is joyful news.

4
00:02:06,374 --> 00:02:09,832
We will call him Thopaga (joyful news) .

5
00:02:47,048 --> 00:02:48,743
She is so lucky.

6
00:02:50,852 --> 00:02:53,912
A rich husband and now a son.

7
00:03:39,467 --> 00:03:40,627
Come!

8
00:03:41,169 --> 00:03:43,535
Zesay, come!

9
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:45,902
Peta, come!

10
00:03:48,877 --> 00:03:51,072
What are you two talking about?

11
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,610
Thopaga and Zesay's future.

12
00:03:56,518 --> 00:03:58,952
That's all you talk about these days.

13
00:04:07,529 --> 00:04:08,962
Here, have some meat.

14
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,189
lt'll make you strong.

15
00:04:57,779 --> 00:04:59,576
Peta, wake your father.

16
00:05:00,181 --> 00:05:03,173
He has to go to Dingri.

17
00:05:10,725 --> 00:05:13,125
Thopaga, that's making too much dust.

18
00:05:17,198 --> 00:05:19,894
Mother! Father won't get up.

19
00:05:41,122 --> 00:05:44,114
Call my brother and sister.

20
00:05:44,726 --> 00:05:46,626
Yungdrung Gyaltsen.

21
00:05:56,905 --> 00:05:59,635
Yungdrung Gyaltsen and Peydon,

22
00:05:59,941 --> 00:06:03,604
please take care of my children.

23
00:06:04,245 --> 00:06:06,907
Give them the love
l won't be here to give.

24
00:06:08,016 --> 00:06:11,315
Don't worry, your children
are my children.

25
00:06:13,021 --> 00:06:15,649
lt's all in writing.

26
00:06:15,723 --> 00:06:21,127
l entrust my children to you,
their uncle and aunt.

27
00:06:23,731 --> 00:06:27,064
When my son comes of age
to marry Zesay,

28
00:06:27,735 --> 00:06:34,106
let him receive all my wealth
without exception.

29
00:06:40,882 --> 00:06:43,282
Kargyen,

30
00:06:44,018 --> 00:06:47,044
please forgive me.

31
00:06:47,822 --> 00:06:51,155
l didn't expect to go so soon.

32
00:06:51,626 --> 00:06:54,117
lt makes me sad.

33
00:06:54,295 --> 00:06:58,664
This is something we can't change.

34
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,227
lt's karma.

35
00:07:01,803 --> 00:07:03,202
Be strong.

36
00:07:04,906 --> 00:07:08,774
Don't worry about us.

37
00:07:09,644 --> 00:07:11,236
We will be fine.

38
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,712
Don't look back.

39
00:07:36,971 --> 00:07:37,960
Take this.

40
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:43,841
This too.

41
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:05,097
These are our most precious jewels.

42
00:08:19,047 --> 00:08:21,914
A rich widow is an easy target.

43
00:08:22,383 --> 00:08:25,352
These will be safer with us.

44
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:30,414
We'll look after you.

45
00:08:31,292 --> 00:08:33,260
Don't worry.

46
00:09:14,035 --> 00:09:15,229
Peta!

47
00:09:15,903 --> 00:09:19,202
You're still taking lice
out of your blouse?

48
00:09:19,373 --> 00:09:22,001
l really need a new one.

49
00:09:22,443 --> 00:09:24,502
How can you talk like that?

50
00:09:25,046 --> 00:09:28,038
We don't even have enough to eat.

51
00:09:32,487 --> 00:09:34,182
You still haven't finished.

52
00:09:35,056 --> 00:09:36,785
You're so lazy.

53
00:09:37,191 --> 00:09:39,125
What do you do all day?

54
00:09:39,994 --> 00:09:43,293
Your husband really spoiled you.

55
00:09:43,965 --> 00:09:45,990
lf you don't work,
why should we feed you?

56
00:09:47,101 --> 00:09:51,401
Mila's not coming back...
and that son of yours,

57
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,035
where is he?

58
00:09:58,212 --> 00:10:00,271
Hurry and finish!

59
00:10:00,481 --> 00:10:01,539
Hurry up.

60
00:10:03,951 --> 00:10:05,816
We didn't have to take you in.

61
00:10:05,987 --> 00:10:08,114
Don't touch that.

62
00:10:08,289 --> 00:10:09,847
lt's for Senge.

63
00:10:22,103 --> 00:10:25,402
One man's pleasure
is another man's pain.

64
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,521
You should rest. l'll finish.

65
00:11:04,011 --> 00:11:06,878
Why do l always lose at dice?

66
00:11:30,037 --> 00:11:31,971
Zesay, what a nice surprise.

67
00:11:33,107 --> 00:11:34,597
What are you doing here?

68
00:11:35,109 --> 00:11:37,077
l was hoping l might find you here.

69
00:11:37,945 --> 00:11:39,936
Should we walk back together?

70
00:11:40,481 --> 00:11:41,607
Oh, wait...

71
00:11:42,183 --> 00:11:43,582
This is for you.

72
00:11:46,387 --> 00:11:47,251
Dried cheese.

73
00:11:49,357 --> 00:11:50,551
Thank you.

74
00:11:52,059 --> 00:11:53,549
These are for you.

75
00:11:56,197 --> 00:11:57,391
They smell nice.

76
00:11:58,366 --> 00:12:01,358
l wish l had more to give you.

77
00:12:01,636 --> 00:12:03,604
Thinking of me is enough.

78
00:12:17,118 --> 00:12:19,052
Don't you have enough?

79
00:12:19,954 --> 00:12:23,355
What about you? Don't you have enough?

80
00:12:24,692 --> 00:12:27,957
Such a greedy woman,
too bad she's my sister.

81
00:12:56,157 --> 00:13:00,685
How dare you sing
while we are so miserable!

82
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:18,643
Mother, l'm sorry.

83
00:13:20,047 --> 00:13:22,515
l wish your father was here.

84
00:13:23,584 --> 00:13:26,178
lf he was still here,

85
00:13:28,222 --> 00:13:31,282
things would be different.

86
00:14:40,863 --> 00:14:42,592
What's going on down there?

87
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:51,637
Tidy yourself up.
Today's an important day.

88
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,273
Right here is fine.

89
00:15:35,918 --> 00:15:36,907
Yungdrung Gyaltsen.

90
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:41,678
Kargyen would like to invite you both
to a rice wine party.

91
00:15:42,224 --> 00:15:43,919
She's having a party?

92
00:16:19,695 --> 00:16:21,094
What's going on here?

93
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:24,855
Just a small gathering
with friends and family.

94
00:16:26,001 --> 00:16:27,866
Please have a seat.

95
00:16:46,455 --> 00:16:48,685
Kargyen, it's time.

96
00:16:59,201 --> 00:17:01,465
l'm grateful you have...

97
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:04,236
joined us today

98
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:07,298
for this humble celebration.

99
00:17:09,011 --> 00:17:11,138
As you all know,

100
00:17:12,414 --> 00:17:14,882
ever since my husband Mila died

101
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:17,314
many years ago,

102
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,914
we have suffered a lot.

103
00:17:22,024 --> 00:17:26,120
Today is a new beginning

104
00:17:27,029 --> 00:17:30,089
and a happy occasion.

105
00:17:43,345 --> 00:17:46,212
Yungdrung Gyaltsen and Peydon,

106
00:17:47,783 --> 00:17:50,411
l want to thank you

107
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:54,314
for taking care of us.

108
00:17:55,858 --> 00:18:02,787
l've invited you here
to request the return

109
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:06,900
of my son's inheritance

110
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:12,871
left to him by his father.

111
00:18:14,376 --> 00:18:16,367
lnheritance? What inheritance?

112
00:18:16,545 --> 00:18:18,536
Mila had no estate!

113
00:18:19,214 --> 00:18:21,273
lt was always mine, on loan to him!

114
00:18:21,483 --> 00:18:22,313
Mine! He just returned it to me!

115
00:18:23,385 --> 00:18:25,376
Please don't say this.

116
00:18:25,988 --> 00:18:28,456
Even if there's not much left,

117
00:18:28,824 --> 00:18:31,918
give us what little there is.

118
00:18:31,994 --> 00:18:34,087
Didn't you hear?

119
00:18:34,296 --> 00:18:36,025
There's nothing!

120
00:18:36,231 --> 00:18:40,099
ls this what we get
after all these years?

121
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:46,804
Even this house belongs to me.
You greedy woman.

122
00:18:51,013 --> 00:18:52,105
Don't touch my mother.

123
00:18:53,582 --> 00:18:54,549
Leave her alone.

124
00:19:02,424 --> 00:19:03,823
Stop! Stop!

125
00:19:06,862 --> 00:19:08,830
We don't need this.

126
00:19:09,298 --> 00:19:11,061
Don't be so naive.

127
00:19:11,133 --> 00:19:13,158
lt's yours.

128
00:19:13,602 --> 00:19:15,365
lt's your birthright.

129
00:19:15,604 --> 00:19:16,901
Foolish cow.

130
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,100
Where is your loyalty?
Someone say something.

131
00:19:21,543 --> 00:19:23,909
Mila was good to you.

132
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,507
l called you all here

133
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:29,383
thinking you would honor
Mila's dying wish!

134
00:19:32,554 --> 00:19:35,216
Why doesn't anyone speak up?

135
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:38,991
Let's go.

136
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:46,333
You will regret this!

137
00:19:46,468 --> 00:19:49,562
One day you'll suffer like we have.

138
00:19:50,172 --> 00:19:53,107
lf you are many, make war.

139
00:19:53,575 --> 00:19:56,373
lf you are few, cast spells.

140
00:20:00,048 --> 00:20:03,540
These people are following
the scent of money.

141
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:30,237
l'll get some tea.

142
00:20:52,267 --> 00:20:53,962
Some blouses for Peta.

143
00:20:54,269 --> 00:20:55,429
Thank you.

144
00:21:01,109 --> 00:21:03,202
ln these difficult times,

145
00:21:03,645 --> 00:21:06,205
you two and my brother

146
00:21:06,415 --> 00:21:08,315
are the only ones...

147
00:21:09,117 --> 00:21:11,278
who have stuck by us.

148
00:21:13,722 --> 00:21:17,385
For this l am very grateful.

149
00:21:21,997 --> 00:21:24,261
lt means a lot to me.

150
00:21:30,272 --> 00:21:32,172
You should send Thopaga

151
00:21:32,341 --> 00:21:34,741
to learn a skill.

152
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:00,591
Can l help you?

153
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:03,267
l need a place for the night.

154
00:22:03,705 --> 00:22:05,730
l'll come down.

155
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:24,616
Enough.

156
00:22:42,744 --> 00:22:46,441
l'll bring another butter lamp.

157
00:23:19,781 --> 00:23:21,305
Be careful,

158
00:23:21,516 --> 00:23:24,280
the consequences can be terrible.

159
00:23:29,591 --> 00:23:34,255
My mother gave me this field
when l married Mila.

160
00:23:35,697 --> 00:23:38,860
lt's all l have left...

161
00:23:44,806 --> 00:23:47,206
The soil is no good.

162
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:50,334
But barley grows well here.

163
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:54,115
lt's all we've had to live on.

164
00:23:56,284 --> 00:23:59,720
Please, l really need the money.

165
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:05,418
Your husband was always good to us,

166
00:24:06,495 --> 00:24:12,161
so l'll buy the field as a favor.

167
00:24:13,301 --> 00:24:14,359
Thank you.

168
00:25:10,892 --> 00:25:11,824
Son.

169
00:25:12,227 --> 00:25:14,388
l sold the field.

170
00:25:14,663 --> 00:25:15,220
What...

171
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:16,890
Why?

172
00:25:27,709 --> 00:25:30,507
We have suffered so much.

173
00:25:32,414 --> 00:25:35,315
l can't bear it any longer.

174
00:25:37,819 --> 00:25:40,447
l want revenge...

175
00:25:41,523 --> 00:25:43,991
against those who harmed us.

176
00:25:45,393 --> 00:25:46,951
What can we do?

177
00:25:48,263 --> 00:25:50,993
Your aunt is going to get
what she asked for.

178
00:25:51,399 --> 00:25:54,493
l want you to master the art of sorcery.

179
00:25:55,403 --> 00:26:00,670
Destroy your aunt and uncle
and all the villagers

180
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:03,501
who treated us badly.

181
00:26:10,685 --> 00:26:12,016
Zesay, l have to go away.

182
00:26:12,954 --> 00:26:14,581
How long will you be gone?

183
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,458
l don't know.

184
00:26:17,692 --> 00:26:18,852
Maybe a few months.

185
00:26:20,462 --> 00:26:22,521
l'll try to come back soon.

186
00:26:23,298 --> 00:26:24,856
Do you have to go?

187
00:26:33,875 --> 00:26:34,773
Hurry...

188
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:36,804
The sun's almost up.

189
00:26:37,779 --> 00:26:41,271
You must leave
before the village awakes.

190
00:27:10,345 --> 00:27:10,902
Son,

191
00:27:11,413 --> 00:27:14,678
let the memory of your father

192
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:17,750
and the cruelty of your uncle

193
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:21,548
inspire you in your studies.

194
00:27:22,357 --> 00:27:24,848
lf vengeance does not come soon,

195
00:27:24,926 --> 00:27:26,689
l will kill myself

196
00:27:27,028 --> 00:27:28,928
in your very presence.

197
00:27:30,765 --> 00:27:32,426
Mother, l will do my best.

198
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:39,097
Offer this turquoise to your teacher.

199
00:27:49,651 --> 00:27:51,983
l'll return as soon as
l fulfill your wish.

200
00:27:57,792 --> 00:27:59,123
Take care.

201
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:33,925
Zesay! What are you doing here?

202
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:37,158
l wanted to see you off.

203
00:28:42,103 --> 00:28:45,095
Don't open it now.
lt's a surprise.

204
00:28:54,883 --> 00:28:56,510
l'll miss you.

205
00:29:02,791 --> 00:29:04,656
l must hurry.

206
00:29:06,194 --> 00:29:07,661
Come back soon.

207
00:29:37,892 --> 00:29:39,757
He can never do it.

208
00:29:39,828 --> 00:29:40,988
l swear.

209
00:29:43,898 --> 00:29:47,561
Kargyen sent Thopaga to study sorcery.

210
00:29:47,969 --> 00:29:49,129
Are you sure?

211
00:29:49,504 --> 00:29:51,165
Yes, l just heard.

212
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,889
Can l camp here for the night?

213
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:28,357
Okay.

214
00:32:34,771 --> 00:32:36,739
The nights get pretty lonely
in these parts.

215
00:33:13,777 --> 00:33:14,937
Where are you from?

216
00:33:15,345 --> 00:33:16,744
Kya Ngatsa.

217
00:33:20,417 --> 00:33:21,884
lt's near Gunthang.

218
00:33:23,487 --> 00:33:24,715
What brings you to these parts?

219
00:33:33,363 --> 00:33:35,524
Whatever it is, we have the whole night.

220
00:33:36,509 --> 00:33:37,797
l'll get my saddle.

221
00:34:35,693 --> 00:34:38,957
Amazing!

222
00:34:40,731 --> 00:34:45,691
l'm going to hang prayer flags
for our safe journey.

223
00:34:58,015 --> 00:35:01,416
Protectors dwell in places like this.

224
00:35:12,996 --> 00:35:14,554
Hurry!

225
00:35:15,332 --> 00:35:16,731
My uncle's coming!

226
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:17,989
Let's go!

227
00:36:32,976 --> 00:36:33,772
Dharma!

228
00:36:34,411 --> 00:36:36,072
What are you doing? Hurry!

229
00:36:38,548 --> 00:36:39,845
Hurry! Let's go!

230
00:37:06,476 --> 00:37:08,501
They can't be too far away.

231
00:37:08,845 --> 00:37:10,039
Let's go!

232
00:37:24,494 --> 00:37:28,055
Don't look back.

233
00:37:29,166 --> 00:37:30,997
l'm worried about my family.

234
00:37:31,168 --> 00:37:33,033
They may be in danger.

235
00:37:34,671 --> 00:37:36,764
Don't let your emotions take over.

236
00:37:36,765 --> 00:37:38,000
Let's go!

237
00:38:13,176 --> 00:38:14,768
What happened?

238
00:38:14,978 --> 00:38:17,208
We crossed this bridge before.

239
00:38:17,647 --> 00:38:19,239
Maybe it's Thopaga's magic?

240
00:38:19,649 --> 00:38:21,139
lt's not Thopaga!

241
00:38:21,518 --> 00:38:22,985
We just got lost in the fog.

242
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:48,907
Curse this fog!

243
00:38:49,846 --> 00:38:52,178
Can you see the trail?

244
00:39:07,564 --> 00:39:09,225
Are you still worried?

245
00:39:12,269 --> 00:39:13,634
Yes.

246
00:39:14,638 --> 00:39:16,799
They could be here any moment.

247
00:39:24,247 --> 00:39:28,183
Trust me, they won't be coming.

248
00:39:28,885 --> 00:39:30,216
How do you know?

249
00:39:31,254 --> 00:39:33,916
They got a little confused on the trail.

250
00:39:34,658 --> 00:39:35,716
Confused?

251
00:39:37,027 --> 00:39:38,221
Why were they confused?

252
00:39:38,862 --> 00:39:41,330
l played with their minds.

253
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:43,566
What?

254
00:39:43,934 --> 00:39:45,595
l played with their minds.

255
00:39:46,002 --> 00:39:47,560
How?

256
00:39:48,605 --> 00:39:50,573
How do you do that?

257
00:39:52,275 --> 00:39:53,936
l study with a great master.

258
00:39:54,144 --> 00:39:54,940
Who?

259
00:39:55,145 --> 00:39:58,080
Yungton Trogyel of Yarlung.

260
00:39:58,281 --> 00:39:59,908
Ah, this is wonderful!

261
00:40:00,617 --> 00:40:02,050
He's the one l've been searching for.

262
00:40:15,899 --> 00:40:19,027
That's the fortress of Yungton Trogyel.

263
00:40:51,334 --> 00:40:53,894
Your father has been waiting for you.

264
00:40:55,071 --> 00:40:56,231
He's your father?

265
00:41:33,176 --> 00:41:35,440
You were supposed to be back yesterday

266
00:41:36,179 --> 00:41:39,046
but you're here today.

267
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:43,879
l met someone on the way.

268
00:41:45,388 --> 00:41:46,855
He needed my help.

269
00:42:03,006 --> 00:42:05,975
There must be a good reason

270
00:42:06,409 --> 00:42:10,311
why you've shown him compassion.

271
00:42:13,283 --> 00:42:15,274
So, what's your story?

272
00:42:29,365 --> 00:42:31,026
l make this offering.

273
00:42:36,506 --> 00:42:40,408
l request you accept me
as your student.

274
00:43:35,965 --> 00:43:38,866
Yesterday l spoke about death charts

275
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:43,964
that are used to determine
a person's time of death,

276
00:43:44,874 --> 00:43:46,933
and when their life force is vulnerable.

277
00:43:47,844 --> 00:43:50,506
Each day of the week,

278
00:43:54,450 --> 00:43:56,077
everyone has white days

279
00:43:56,252 --> 00:43:59,983
when their power
and life force are high.

280
00:44:01,024 --> 00:44:05,188
And black days, when their power
and life force are vulnerable.

281
00:44:05,862 --> 00:44:07,921
lf you want to help someone,

282
00:44:08,398 --> 00:44:13,233
you should do so when
your white days overlap.

283
00:44:13,403 --> 00:44:17,203
But to harm someone

284
00:44:18,875 --> 00:44:22,038
you must determine when your white day

285
00:44:22,879 --> 00:44:28,044
overlaps with your enemy's black day.

286
00:44:29,085 --> 00:44:31,280
lf you can determine that day,

287
00:44:31,454 --> 00:44:37,290
you'll be empowered
to perform spells effectively.

288
00:44:50,306 --> 00:44:51,637
You're no good.

289
00:44:52,308 --> 00:44:53,605
Just wait.

290
00:45:02,919 --> 00:45:04,352
Any other challengers?

291
00:45:05,121 --> 00:45:06,918
- You go.
- No, you go!

292
00:45:41,958 --> 00:45:43,425
Hey, Thopaga!

293
00:46:12,322 --> 00:46:14,222
l'll kill myself...

294
00:46:57,333 --> 00:47:01,064
You have been given
all necessary instructions,

295
00:47:01,237 --> 00:47:04,001
incantations, and secret methods.

296
00:47:04,173 --> 00:47:09,702
lt's time for you to go back
to your villages.

297
00:47:10,513 --> 00:47:12,504
There is nothing more to teach you.

298
00:47:13,383 --> 00:47:15,442
Guard the teachings and...

299
00:47:16,185 --> 00:47:18,085
practice well.

300
00:48:52,882 --> 00:48:54,281
Thopaga is still here.

301
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:56,575
He's outside.

302
00:49:02,358 --> 00:49:03,689
Poor boy.

303
00:49:04,427 --> 00:49:06,520
He thinks sorcery

304
00:49:06,896 --> 00:49:09,160
is a poor man's weapon

305
00:49:09,565 --> 00:49:12,500
against injustice.

306
00:49:14,303 --> 00:49:15,861
Shall l bring him in?

307
00:49:16,405 --> 00:49:17,337
Yes.

308
00:49:56,612 --> 00:49:59,240
Why are you still here?

309
00:50:00,216 --> 00:50:02,707
The practices l've learned

310
00:50:02,885 --> 00:50:05,445
are not effective enough.

311
00:50:10,259 --> 00:50:13,387
lf l leave now,
my mother will kill herself.

312
00:50:16,532 --> 00:50:17,624
Precious Master,

313
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:20,428
l request
the innermost secret teachings.

314
00:50:27,677 --> 00:50:30,908
l will send Dharma to your village

315
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:34,408
to verify your story.

316
00:50:36,786 --> 00:50:38,583
That will take days.

317
00:50:39,655 --> 00:50:40,622
lt's very far.

318
00:50:41,857 --> 00:50:43,586
lt won't take long.

319
00:50:44,727 --> 00:50:47,457
Dharma has mastered kang gyok.

320
00:50:49,265 --> 00:50:51,426
He will return in one day.

321
00:52:06,609 --> 00:52:08,509
Master, Thopaga's story is true.

322
00:52:09,045 --> 00:52:10,444
Really?

323
00:52:16,519 --> 00:52:18,544
As your story is true,

324
00:52:19,522 --> 00:52:22,753
you have no choice.

325
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:27,386
Your cruel and corrupt relatives

326
00:52:28,497 --> 00:52:33,400
have no regard for right and wrong.

327
00:52:34,103 --> 00:52:37,436
They must suffer

328
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:40,438
the consequences of their actions.

329
00:52:41,444 --> 00:52:44,470
Dharma will take you to the master,
Yonten Gyatso.

330
00:52:44,847 --> 00:52:46,508
Can he really help me?

331
00:52:47,049 --> 00:52:48,346
Of course.

332
00:52:48,651 --> 00:52:52,109
He is the descendant of Sangye Yeshe.

333
00:52:52,555 --> 00:52:58,425
There is no one more powerful than him.

334
00:54:32,054 --> 00:54:35,751
Bring yourself in front of me.
This old man never looks back.

335
00:54:45,501 --> 00:54:46,968
We are students of Yungton Trogyel.

336
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:54,234
l was expecting you.

337
00:55:03,185 --> 00:55:06,154
Construct a chamber where
people will not see it.

338
00:55:37,253 --> 00:55:40,552
This particular method
is a secret teaching...

339
00:55:42,091 --> 00:55:45,549
from the lineage of the great master,
Sangye Yeshe.

340
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:54,567
Transmitted only once in a master's lifetime,

341
00:55:54,970 --> 00:55:59,202
in this lifetime, you are
the one to receive it from me.

342
00:56:01,911 --> 00:56:05,972
lf you practice it diligently,
a result should manifest in seven days.

343
00:57:18,988 --> 00:57:23,049
Thopaga, it's the seventh day.
Any signs?

344
00:57:24,793 --> 00:57:27,694
Lama, l ask to continue for seven more days.

345
00:57:28,397 --> 00:57:30,194
You have been distracted.

346
00:57:30,366 --> 00:57:32,357
ln the dark,

347
00:57:33,736 --> 00:57:36,000
the mind has no leash.

348
00:57:38,273 --> 00:57:41,401
Thoughts become strong and reckless

349
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:47,410
and visions emerge from chaos.

350
00:57:48,083 --> 00:57:51,018
lf you are trapped by these illusions,

351
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:54,121
you will accomplish nothing.

352
01:01:47,322 --> 01:01:49,222
You little monsters,
watch where you're going!

353
01:03:41,339 --> 01:03:44,672
Young man, is that a storm approaching?

354
01:03:45,710 --> 01:03:48,235
Yes. A very big storm.

355
01:03:49,047 --> 01:03:51,675
We should take shelter.

356
01:05:17,935 --> 01:05:21,302
At last!
This must be Thopaga's doing!

357
01:07:00,004 --> 01:07:01,335
l warned you,

358
01:07:02,206 --> 01:07:04,834
my revenge would come.

359
01:07:05,409 --> 01:07:07,343
You deserve this for causing us pain.

360
01:07:08,279 --> 01:07:10,406
Do you hear me?

361
01:07:10,815 --> 01:07:13,784
l can't believe this day
has finally arrived.

362
01:07:14,318 --> 01:07:17,446
What a wonderful spectacle to behold!

363
01:07:18,923 --> 01:07:21,892
l'll kill you, witch!

364
01:10:22,639 --> 01:10:24,129
Look! Smoke!

365
01:10:24,708 --> 01:10:25,902
Come on.

366
01:10:38,989 --> 01:10:40,980
Hey! Stop where you are.

367
01:10:41,491 --> 01:10:43,118
Come closer and l'll kill you all.

368
01:10:43,627 --> 01:10:46,858
Murderer!
We'll kill you first!

369
01:10:48,131 --> 01:10:51,100
You deserve to die.
You destroyed my family!

370
01:11:44,862 --> 01:11:46,022
What do you want?

371
01:11:46,597 --> 01:11:48,064
A safe place for the night.

372
01:13:00,070 --> 01:13:01,935
Old monk, thank you.

373
01:13:47,851 --> 01:13:50,046
What can l do for you?

374
01:13:50,153 --> 01:13:51,984
Old monk, we're looking for a friend.

375
01:13:52,122 --> 01:13:53,316
Did he come here?

376
01:13:55,025 --> 01:14:00,292
Rarely does anyone come this way.

377
01:14:00,464 --> 01:14:02,898
The old monk wouldn't lie.

378
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,468
Come on, let's go.

379
01:14:31,828 --> 01:14:33,489
Enemies are never ending.

380
01:14:37,901 --> 01:14:41,029
Your enemies arise from your mind.

381
01:14:41,438 --> 01:14:43,963
lt's just a matter

382
01:14:44,174 --> 01:14:47,234
of learning how to control your mind.

383
01:14:51,448 --> 01:14:54,508
You better finish your soup
while it's still hot.

384
01:15:07,064 --> 01:15:08,190
What are you reading?

385
01:15:08,498 --> 01:15:10,523
The words of the Buddha.

386
01:15:14,004 --> 01:15:16,996
What does the Buddha say?

387
01:15:19,342 --> 01:15:21,173
Cease negative actions,

388
01:15:21,344 --> 01:15:25,371
cultivate positive actions,
and tame your mind.

389
01:19:11,207 --> 01:19:12,174
What?

390
01:19:12,342 --> 01:19:14,606
Why don't you help me with these?

391
01:19:30,093 --> 01:19:31,788
What's the problem?

392
01:19:33,363 --> 01:19:37,390
You should rejoice
in your accomplishments.

393
01:19:40,804 --> 01:19:45,673
Rejoice? l've accomplished nothing.

394
01:19:57,220 --> 01:20:00,747
Don't let the memories
of the dead haunt you.

395
01:20:02,125 --> 01:20:03,820
They deserved it.

396
01:20:44,134 --> 01:20:45,465
Sit.

397
01:21:14,497 --> 01:21:16,488
What troubles you these days?

398
01:21:21,438 --> 01:21:24,635
What is it? Tell me?

399
01:21:29,212 --> 01:21:32,807
l don't know what to do...
l'm so tormented.

400
01:21:35,585 --> 01:21:39,351
Revenge doesn't solve
any problem.

401
01:21:39,522 --> 01:21:41,854
lt only creates more.

402
01:21:42,459 --> 01:21:45,189
ls there any other way?

403
01:21:49,799 --> 01:21:53,565
Yesterday, my benefactor died.

404
01:21:54,671 --> 01:21:57,572
l couldn't save him.

405
01:21:58,875 --> 01:22:03,369
lt's ironic, that l, Yungton Trogyel,

406
01:22:03,613 --> 01:22:04,944
who can...

407
01:22:05,782 --> 01:22:07,306
kill thousands,

408
01:22:08,485 --> 01:22:09,816
can do nothing...

409
01:22:10,887 --> 01:22:14,653
to save a single man from death.

410
01:22:19,929 --> 01:22:21,829
Everybody dies, don't they?

411
01:22:28,771 --> 01:22:30,796
When death comes,

412
01:22:32,542 --> 01:22:35,807
only your life's actions accompany you.

413
01:22:36,246 --> 01:22:42,242
Your future will come from your past,

414
01:22:42,418 --> 01:22:45,444
as the Udumbara flower comes
from its seed.

415
01:22:46,256 --> 01:22:48,383
Then the future for my mother and me

416
01:22:48,558 --> 01:22:50,992
is nothing but suffering.

417
01:22:52,562 --> 01:22:56,430
lf l could take on my mother's part
in all of this, l would.

418
01:22:59,435 --> 01:23:02,734
You can't change your karma...

419
01:23:03,573 --> 01:23:07,304
like you change your horse.

420
01:23:07,477 --> 01:23:09,411
lt's not that easy.

421
01:23:10,980 --> 01:23:14,973
But there is a way to help your mother.

422
01:23:17,453 --> 01:23:18,886
What is this way?

423
01:23:20,757 --> 01:23:24,249
By following the path
of the enlightened ones

424
01:23:24,694 --> 01:23:28,391
you are destined to arrive
at the place beyond all suffering.

425
01:23:28,565 --> 01:23:32,296
This is the way to really
help your mother,

426
01:23:33,703 --> 01:23:36,866
and all living beings.

427
01:23:38,575 --> 01:23:41,544
Precious Master,
can you teach me this way?

428
01:23:43,479 --> 01:23:48,507
This old fool can only tell you
who to go to.

429
01:24:21,751 --> 01:24:23,685
This is as far as l go.

430
01:24:27,824 --> 01:24:28,950
Come with me.

431
01:24:29,559 --> 01:24:33,689
No, but l wish you luck.

432
01:24:35,498 --> 01:24:37,693
l hope you find what you're looking for.

433
01:24:39,369 --> 01:24:40,461
Stay well.
H-M
