1
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:38,200
- Hang on. We're coming to a bend.
- You're going too fast.

2
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:42,800
What's this old iron doing here?
I'll give you ten bob for it.

3
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:48,280
Don't be daft. This was once a great car.
It won the Grand Prix three years running.

4
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,760
So it's a car, is it?

5
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,160
- Certainly it's a car.
- A racing car.

6
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,680
- And we're winning.
- You're in the way.

7
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:00,240
You're in the way for a belt around
the ear if I have any more of your lip.

8
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,280
All right. I'll give you 15 bob for it.

9
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,440
Make it 30 and she's yours.

10
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,240
Mr Coggins,
you're not going to sell her.

11
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,520
Course he is. You think
he's running a children's playground?

12
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,400
All right, 30 bob.
I'll pick her up Wednesday.

13
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,280
But you promised we could play in her.

14
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:23,440
I'm sorry, but she ain't any use to me.
Times are hard.

15
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,720
- But you can't take her away.
- She's not any old car. She's ours.

16
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,520
Not any more she ain't.
I'll see you tomorrow, Bill.

17
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:36,640
- What are you going to do with her?
- We'll put her in the clapper.

18
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,120
Crunch her up
till she's one solid piece of metal.

19
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:44,880
Then we're gonna put her in the furnace,
melt her down till she's liquid iron.

20
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,880
That's what we're gonna do.

21
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,080
Look what you've done.
You've frightened her.

22
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,960
- She shivered.
- See? She's a very special car.

23
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,240
If you put her in the furnace,
you'll be guilty of murder.

24
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:01,520
And if you don't get out of it,
I'll be guilty of two more murders.

25
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:09,240
You can't sell our lovely car
to that nasty man.

26
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:13,320
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I already have.

27
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,400
I know. Daddy will buy it for us,
won't he, Jemima?

28
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,800
Of course.

29
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,360
Promise you won't let it go
until we come back.

30
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,080
30 shillings, mind, not a penny less.

31
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,120
- Please promise.
- Please.

32
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,600
- All right, I promise.
- Come on, Jemima.

33
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,200
That's a clever thing to do.

34
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,760
- We're very sorry, miss.
- I'm sure you are.

35
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:01,400
Just look at my car.
And look at the mess I'm in, too.

36
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:06,160
- Oh, no. I think you're beautiful.
- And I like your car.

37
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,000
Hmm.

38
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,120
You shouldn't be rushing across the road.

39
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,480
You might have been killed.
Anyway, why aren't you in school?

40
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,120
- It isn't a holiday, is it?
- No, miss.

41
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,440
- Do you live around here?
- Just down the road.

42
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,840
Get into my car.
I'm taking you home.

43
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,960
Just wait till Daddy hears
we've been for a ride in a motor car.

44
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,000
- What's your name?
- I'm Jemima.

45
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,160
- And I'm Jeremy.
- What's yours?

46
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,280
- Truly.
- That's a very pretty name.

47
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,600
Now, where is your house?

48
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,200
- We don't live in a house.
- We live in a castle on top of a hill.

49
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:51,080
I didn't know there
were any castles around here.

50
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,440
It isn't a castle exactly.

51
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:58,560
Daddy calls it that. He says King Alfred
used to live there a long time ago.

52
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,160
And does your daddy know
you aren't in school?

53
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,360
He won't mind.

54
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,440
He's awfully busy.

55
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:09,520
Is he? Well, he'll have
to find time to see me.

56
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,240
I have a few things to say to him.

57
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,320
Edison! Here, boy.

58
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,200
Good boy.

59
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,680
That's Daddy over there.

60
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,920
- Hello!
- Hello. You're just in time.

61
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,560
- What is he up to?
- That's his latest invention.

62
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,640
- Rockets.
- Rockets?

63
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,560
Stand back. Keep clear.

64
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,720
Hurray!

65
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,840
- Does he know what he's doing?
- Of course he does.

66
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,440
Whoa!

67
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,160
That's not funny.
Somebody should do something.

68
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,920
Hold on.

69
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,680
Wait there.

70
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,240
- Thank you.
- You might have gone up in flames.

71
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,680
Madam, I took that into consideration.
This suit is flameproof.

72
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,440
- Oh, dear.
- You have ruined my propulsion unit.

73
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,720
- How was I to know...
- Don't be cross with the lady.

74
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,640
- She gave us a ride.
- She was only trying to help.

75
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,960
- How very kind.
- Her name's Truly.

76
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,040
Do you realise I nearly
knocked down your children?

77
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,520
We do seem to be
accident-prone, don't we?

78
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,040
It wasn't my fault.
They came rushing...

79
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,000
It was very nice of you to apologise.
Tea time, children.

80
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,160
- Goodbye.
- Thanks for the ride.

81
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,440
Don't you have something
to tell your father?

82
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,880
Yes, we have.
Mr Coggins promised us...

83
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:47,120
She doesn't mean about that.
Daddy, we didn't go to school today.

84
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,560
Oh-ho.

85
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:52,600
It'll give the other children
a chance to catch up, won't it?

86
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,680
- Bye.
- Bye, Truly.

87
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,160
- But, Mr Potts...
- Good day.

88
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,240
Unstable. Definitely unstable.

89
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,320
Hey, hey!

90
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,120
Good afternoon, miss.
Sorry I can't stop.

91
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,960
I'm off to India
to have tea with the maharajah. Cheerio.

92
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Mr Potts.

93
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,480
Mr Potts?

94
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,240
I'm sorry to persist about this.

95
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:01,360
Perhaps you aren't aware your children
were running about in the road.

96
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,120
It's not a playground...

97
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,880
Would you mind
pressing that switch there?

98
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,400
Just behind you. On the right.

99
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,480
The right?

100
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,240
Thank you.

101
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,920
You ought to exercise
more control over them.

102
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,200
I suppose I could chain them up.

103
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,200
On a long chain,
so they get plenty of exercise.

104
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,720
Don't your children go to school?

105
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,040
- I have it now, you're the truant officer.
- No, I'm not.

106
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,440
Didn't you ever play truant?

107
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:32,720
- I most certainly did not.
- I bet you didn't.

108
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:38,000
Would it be too much
to ask what this is? This... thing?

109
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,960
An invention of mine.
Cleans carpets by suction.

110
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,120
All that to clean carpets?

111
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,880
Away with sweeping and brushing
and dirty carpets.

112
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,680
Is that all you do? Invent things?

113
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,120
- Is that all I do?
- What's this gadget?

114
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:04,160
That's not quite right yet, but I hope
to transmit moving pictures by wireless.

115
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,240
- Really?
- Yes, really. As Marconi...

116
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,640
And this?

117
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,520
This is a sweet-making machine.

118
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,800
- Is this one of the sweets?
- Yes, it is.

119
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,520
Is it supposed to have holes in it?

120
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,240
No. Actually, I think the problem...

121
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,600
The boiling point
of your sugar is too high.

122
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,960
An expert on sweet-making, are we?

123
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,720
- And an expert on child welfare.
- I was only trying to help.

124
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,080
Maybe my children like running wild.
Did that ever occur to you?

125
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:39,040
And how my children behave
is frankly no concern of yours.

126
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:44,200
So take off in your fancy automobile
and go do good somewhere else.

127
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,640
I've never been...

128
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,760
Spoken to that way before?
Maybe it's about time.

129
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,040
Good afternoon, madam.

130
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,200
Mind the cable!

131
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,120
Officious, interfering...

132
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,640
If women want to drive motor cars,
they should learn to operate one.

133
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:14,240
I suppose it wouldn't occur to you
to offer to help me.

134
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,120
Get in the car, please.

135
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,040
For a mechanically-minded man...

136
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,920
- Try switching it on!
- Oh.

137
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,760
Hmph!

138
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,720
Open the throttle.

139
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,400
And keep it open.

140
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,080
Women!

141
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,760
Confounded woman.
Who does she think she is?

142
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:05,720
Coming in here and telling me
how to raise my children.

143
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,560
Do I need somebody to tell me
how to raise my children?

144
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,640
Of course not.

145
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,440
- Where's my cardigan?
- Under your jacket.

146
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,520
Under... Yes.

147
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,400
Self-righteous busybody.

148
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,440
- She won't be bothering us again.
- But I liked her.

149
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,360
So did I. She was very pretty.

150
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,520
She certainly was.

151
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,840
Do you think your father's a crackpot?

152
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,680
Your cardigan's inside out.

153
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:43,040
Do you think I'm wasting
my time on silly inventions?

154
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,200
But they're wonderful.

155
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,680
- Nobody else could think of them.
- That's right.

156
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,840
Nobody else could think of them.

157
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:56,320
After all, what makes the battle
worth the fighting?

158
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,600
What makes the mountain
worth the climb?

159
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,400
What makes the questions
worth the asking?

160
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,600
The reason worth the rhyme?

161
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,640
## To me the answer's clear

162
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,480
## It's having someone near

163
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,760
## Someone dear

164
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,360
## Someone to care for,
to be there for

165
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,440
## I have you two

166
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,600
## Someone to do for,
muddle through for

167
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,560
## I have you two

168
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,480
## Someone to share
joy or despair with

169
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,600
## Whichever betides you

170
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:42,080
## Life becomes a chore

171
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,680
## Unless you're living for

172
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,920
## Someone to tend to,
be a friend to

173
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,840
## I have you two

174
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:56,840
## Someone to strive for,
do or die for

175
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:00,560
## I have you two

176
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:07,000
## Could be we three
get along so famously

177
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,760
## Cos you two have me

178
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,240
## And I have you two, too

179
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,480
Hurray!

180
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,840
Atchoo!

181
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,480
## Someone to care for,
to be there for

182
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:25,040
## I have you two

183
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,000
## Someone to do for,
muddle through for

184
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,200
## I have you two

185
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:36,400
## Someone to smile
once in a while with

186
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,720
## Whenever you're lonesome

187
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,920
## I've a happy lot

188
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,280
## Considering what I've got

189
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:52,200
## But I couldn't do more
than you do for your poor father

190
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,000
Daddy!

191
00:20:54,080 --> 00:21:01,000
## Things go asunder
and I wonder why you bother

192
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:08,480
## Could be we three
get along so famously cos

193
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,680
## We two have you

194
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:19,880
## And I have you two... too

195
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,720
Jeremy.

196
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,640
Oh, good!

197
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,520
Do I smell food?

198
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,120
Bring the bread, will you, Grandpa?

199
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,640
- And the pepper and salt, please.
- Right away, sir.

200
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,760
Oh! Sausage and egg, my favourite.

201
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,600
How was India?

202
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:46,040
I got up this morning
and I shot an elephant in my pyjamas.

203
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,160
"How he got into my pyjamas
I shall never know."

204
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:52,120
You've heard it before.

205
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,840
- I wonder how that happened.
- Daddy, could we ask you something?

206
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:08,240
- It's about Mr Coggins.
- The junkman wanted to take it away.

207
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,520
But Mr Coggins says if we asked you...

208
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,640
- Ask me what?
- He's a horrid, mean, old man.

209
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,720
- Mr Coggins?
- The junkman.

210
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,280
He'll take it and burn it.

211
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,120
What are you going on about?

212
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,520
- Our car.
- What about it?

213
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,080
Mr Coggins is selling it to the junkman.

214
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,400
And the junkman's
going to put it in the furnace

215
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,000
and skwodge it all up
till there's nothing left.

216
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,960
That's terrible.
We can't let that happen, Grandpa.

217
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,640
No, definitely no.

218
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:45,000
- We knew you wouldn't let him.
- So we can have it for 30 shillings.

219
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,520
- 30 shillings?
- You can pay him tomorrow.

220
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:56,000
Yes, well, I suppose
we can work something out.

221
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,040
- Good!
- Hurray!

222
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,680
- Are you all finished?
- Yes, Daddy.

223
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,360
I think you should go run up to bed.

224
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,400
- Goodnight, Grandpa.
- Goodnight, my boy.

225
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,280
- Goodnight, Grandpa.
- Goodnight, my darling.

226
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,320
- Goodnight, Daddy.
- Goodnight.

227
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,280
You've done it now, haven't you?

228
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,600
You think Coggins might do a deal?

229
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,120
Him down the road? Sure.

230
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,360
He's so mean he wouldn't light
your pipe if his house was on fire.

231
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,840
Did you hear that?
You know what that means?

232
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,400
I'll be up all night, rain pouring in.

233
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,840
Why don't you sleep in the workshop?

234
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,680
In the workshop?
You promised to fix my bedroom roof.

235
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:48,400
- I will. It's just...
- Caractacus, my boy. Listen...

236
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,480
It's time you woke up.

237
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:54,280
- At your age, I did a day's work...
- For a day's pay, polishing boots.

238
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,440
I was the smartest batman in the army.

239
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:01,160
When my brigadier went into action,
the natives were so blinded by his boots,

240
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,800
they couldn't see to fight.

241
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,760
Catch me death of cold.
He don't care.

242
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,880
Nobody cares. Me own son.

243
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,680
She was right. Who wants
sweets with holes in them?

244
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:55,120
Edison, stop that whistling.

245
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,600
Edison, do that again.

246
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:15,400
Edison, you're a genius.

247
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:31,280
The employment office is in the rear.

248
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,560
You see, I've invented these sweets.

249
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,440
Really? Name?

250
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,560
- Whistling sweets.
- Mr Whistling Sweets.

251
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,440
Mr Whistling Sweets!

252
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,480
No. I'm Potts.

253
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,520
May I see the managing director?

254
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,320
Lord Scrumptious sees no one
without an appointment.

255
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,360
- How do I get one?
- Hello, children.

256
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,040
- Jeremy, it's Truly.
- Hello, Truly.

257
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,400
Miss Scrumptious, how nice to see you.

258
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:04,560
Good morning, Phillips.
Please tell my father I'm here.

259
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,160
Of course, Miss Scrumptious.

260
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:11,800
- Are you here on business?
- Yes, Miss...

261
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,720
Father? Truly Scrumptious?

262
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,320
- You're his...
- Daughter.

263
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,320
Let's go.

264
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,480
- You haven't shown your invention.
- I don't think that'll do much good.

265
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,360
Just a moment.
Exactly what was it...

266
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,920
- You've seen them.
- Oh, those.

267
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,440
- But they whistle.
- Whistle?

268
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,880
- Those holes.
- You just blow through them.

269
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,920
They're very ingenious.

270
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,840
Kind of a novelty.

271
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,040
Sssh!

272
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,920
Please go in, Miss Scrumptious.
You can come back in three weeks.

273
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,880
- Show Mr Potts in.
- Now?

274
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,960
- But His Lordship...
- Now.

275
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,200
Please follow me.

276
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:00,160
Maybe I should come back
in three weeks.

277
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,240
Go on, Daddy.

278
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:10,160
And don't let him bully you.

279
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,880
- Mr Potts, my lord.
- Who's he?

280
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,400
- Where's me daughter?
- She insisted on Mr Potts seeing you.

281
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,440
Don't just stand there.
What's it all about?

282
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,760
- Sweets, sir.
- I hardly thought it was nuts and bolts.

283
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,120
Let's have a look.

284
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,720
- Hurry up.
- Yes, sir.

285
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:34,280
- If I may explain...
- You have exactly 20 seconds.

286
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:39,440
The fundamental novelty of the sweets
is their musical quality.

287
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:45,080
Not only are they very tasty but due to
the unique positioning of these holes,

288
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:50,200
when blown through,
they render a tuneful whistle.

289
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,640
Put your fingers over the holes
and blow thus.

290
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,360
Tasting time, my lord.

291
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:02,960
Too late. Had your chance.
Muffed it. Good morning.

292
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,520
Follow him.

293
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,360
My lord?

294
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,880
Excuse me.
Sir, if I may be allowed to demonstrate.

295
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,280
By blowing air through this hole,
you get a wonderful...

296
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,040
- Raspberry?
- No. It's more like a toot really.

297
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,800
Not enough fruit, too much sugar.

298
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:35,520
- Would you care to try it, sir?
- Under no circumstances.

299
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,600
He's not doing very well, is he?

300
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:41,480
Another remarkable feature
is that by sucking...

301
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:44,920
Throw it away.
And get rid of this idiot for me.

302
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,360
Oi, you. Hop it!

303
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,320
They also come in strawberry, raspberry...

304
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:52,800
- Are you still here?
...and pineapple.

305
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:03,120
Don't waste your pucker
on some all-day sucker.

306
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,200
And don't try toffee or cream.

307
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,680
If you seek perfection
in sugar confection,

308
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,560
well, there's something
new on the scene.

309
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,080
A mouthful of cheer,
a sweet without peer.

310
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:20,360
## A musical morsel supreme

311
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,120
## Toot sweets, toot sweets

312
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,760
## The candies you whistle,
the whistles you eat

313
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,800
## Toot sweets, toot sweets

314
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:35,600
## The eatable, tweetable treats

315
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,480
## Toot sweets, toot sweets

316
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:42,240
## The toot of a flute
with the flavour of fruit

317
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,200
## Toot sweets, toot sweets

318
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:48,880
## No longer need candy be mute

319
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,840
## Don't waste your pucker
on some all-day sucker

320
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:55,160
## And don't try a toffee or cream

321
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:58,400
## If you seek perfection
in sugar confection

322
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,680
## Well, there's something
new on the scene

323
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,520
## That mouthful of cheer

324
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,480
## That sweet without peer

325
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:09,640
## That musical morsel supreme

326
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,880
## Toot sweets

327
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,480
## A bonbon to blow on
at last has been found

328
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,560
## Toot sweets, toot sweets

329
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:25,480
## With tweetable, eatable sound

330
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,480
No, take it away.

331
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,480
Father.

332
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,560
Please.

333
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,360
He likes it.

334
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:57,720
- ## Their value is intrinsic
- ## Surpass any mint stick

335
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:01,240
## Or marshmallow mouthful you munch

336
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:04,400
- ## Though liquorice is chewy
- ## And gumdrops are gooey

337
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,320
## And chocolate is charming to crunch

338
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:12,000
- ## That savoury fife
- ## That sweet of your life

339
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:16,480
## It's clearly the best of the bunch

340
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:20,080
## Toot sweets, toot sweets

341
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,840
## Toot sweets, toot sweets

342
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,400
## That savoury fife

343
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:26,280
## That sweet of your life

344
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:33,880
## It's clearly the best of the bunch

345
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:39,760
## Toot sweets, toot sweets

346
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:44,400
## A bonbon to blow on
at last has been found

347
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,960
## Toot sweets, toot sweets

348
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,240
## The treat that's so tweetable

349
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,320
## Lusciously eatable

350
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,920
## With that unbeatable

351
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:33,400
## Sound

352
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,680
Go away.
You'll contaminate the confectionery.

353
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:43,200
What's going on?
Get them out of here.

354
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,840
Edison, no!

355
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,400
Children!

356
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:05,280
It's your fault. I'll send for
the police and the fire brigade.

357
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,760
Daddy?

358
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,400
Why aren't you two asleep?

359
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,040
Don't be sad, Daddy.
It wasn't your fault.

360
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:51,120
It was all those mean old dogs.

361
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,360
Children...

362
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,440
About the car.

363
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,840
You see,

364
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,600
30 shillings is pretty hard to come by.

365
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:08,320
And when I do get any money,
I need it for my inventions.

366
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:13,400
- There isn't any left.
- Jeremy and I have been thinking.

367
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:17,480
- It's our treasure chest.
- These things are enormously valuable.

368
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:21,720
Look. An ivory tusk.
That must be worth a fortune.

369
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,920
And diamonds.

370
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,600
- And a golden crown.
- It's probably King Alfred's.

371
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:33,120
It needs cleaning up a little.
Take them. You can sell them.

372
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:38,320
Never mind about the car.
You can spend it all on your inventions.

373
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,680
Thank you, children.

374
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,440
All these wonderful things.

375
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:51,600
They're very precious. But I'm afraid
other people wouldn't appreciate them.

376
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,240
Why not?

377
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,280
Cos other people
don't see things the way you do.

378
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,120
Let's go to bed.

379
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:05,520
And don't you worry.
Things will come right somehow.

380
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:30,240
## A gentle breeze
from Hushabye Mountain

381
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:36,640
## Softly blows o'er Lullaby Bay

382
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:44,120
## It fills the sails
of boats that are waiting

383
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:51,440
## Waiting to sail
your worries away

384
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:05,040
## It isn't far
to Hushabye Mountain

385
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:12,160
## And your boat
waits down by the quay

386
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:18,960
## The winds of night
so softly are sighing

387
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:26,360
## Soon they will fly
your troubles to sea

388
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:35,840
## So close your eyes
on Hushabye Mountain

389
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:42,480
## Wave goodbye
to cares of the day

390
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:51,000
## And watch your boat
from Hushabye Mountain

391
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:58,760
## Sail far away
from Lullaby Bay

392
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:05,960
All the lovely colours.
Get your balloons here.

393
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:34,400
Hurry along now. These lovely
toffee apples a ha'penny each.

394
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,160
Any more for any more?

395
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:41,960
Which one of you ladies and gentlemen
would like an automatic haircut?

396
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,680
I've stood in this marketplace
for 25 years.

397
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,360
I do not profess to make dead men talk.

398
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:49,640
Hey, now, here you go there.
Who's for an automatic haircut?

399
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,520
Only threepence a time.

400
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:55,240
You may have long, short or straight hair,

401
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:59,760
it makes no difference
to the automatic hair-cutting machine.

402
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:07,880
Here, Cyril.
You could do with an haircut.

403
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,280
Cut me hair?
That's where me strength is.

404
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:13,640
Sir, you look like a man
who could do with a haircut.

405
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,280
Go on, Cyril.

406
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,120
- Come on, sit down.
- Hold that, then.

407
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,800
You have a lot of hair.
Would you like an estimate?

408
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,480
Very funny. Get on with it.

409
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,360
Just sit tight, while I lower
this hair-cutting machine.

410
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,720
We'll have you finished in a minute.

411
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:34,360
- I feel a right nana sitting here.
- You look lovely. It will be smashing.

412
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:38,760
- You keep you eyes on that geezer.
- Yeah, all right.

413
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:42,320
- What's goin' on?
- It's all right.

414
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,720
Nothing to worry about.
A little friction to start.

415
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,400
- It tickles.
- You always say that.

416
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,720
Oh! Oh! Cyril!

417
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,640
- You're smoking.
- I'm on fire.

418
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,240
Stop it!

419
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,480
- Excuse me.
- Me head's on fire.

420
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,880
It's all right, sir.

421
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,680
What you done? Give me a mirror.

422
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:26,160
A mirror?
I'll go home and get you one.

423
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,760
Look at me hair.

424
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:34,440
- Where is he? I'll kill him.
- There he is, mister.

425
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:42,120
I'll smash your teeth down your throat.

426
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,000
There he goes, down there.

427
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:55,080
Come on. You're too fat
to catch him, are you?

428
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,600
Oi, big bonce.

429
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,680
Get out of it!

430
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:18,000
There he is. Get out me way!

431
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,520
Oi!

432
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:35,080
- Hurry up. We're on.
- Get out the way.

433
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,920
## A gentleman's got a walking stick,
a seaman's got a gaff

434
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,320
## And the merry men of Robin Hood
they used a quarterstaff

435
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,760
## On the Spanish plains inside their canes
they hide their ruddy swords

436
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:06,040
## But we make do with an old bamboo
and everyone applauds

437
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,760
## One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven eight

438
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,560
## Me ol' bamboo, me ol' bamboo

439
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,040
## You better never bother
with me ol' bamboo

440
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,840
## You can have me hat
or me bumbershoot

441
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:17,560
## But you better never bother
with me ol' bamboo

442
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:23,440
- ## When punting on the beautiful Thames
- ## You use a sturdy pole

443
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,920
- ## To protect their fair complexion
- ## Ladies use a parasol

444
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,520
- ## It's useful in the underbrush
- ## To have a hefty spear

445
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:34,040
## Right, but what we do with an old
bamboo makes everybody cheer

446
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,760
## One, two, three, ho!

447
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,120
## Me ol' bamboo, me ol' bamboo

448
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,920
## You better never bother
with me ol' bamboo

449
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,640
## You can have me hat
or me bumbershoot

450
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,920
## But you better never bother
with me ol' bamboo

451
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,760
Have a go, mate.

452
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:49,240
- ## A flier in an aerial plane
- ## He steers it with a stick

453
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:52,840
- ## A collier in the pits of Wales
- ## He leans upon his pick

454
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:56,240
## Now every wheel of an automobile
revolves around the shaft

455
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:59,160
## But what we do with an old bamboo
makes everyone go daft

456
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,360
## And, one, two

457
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,120
## Me ol' bamboo, me ol' bamboo.

458
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,640
## You better never bother
with me ol' bamboo

459
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,600
## You can have me hat
or me bumbershoot

460
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,360
## But you better never bother
with me ol' bamboo

461
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:17,120
## One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight

462
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,720
## And a one, two, three, four

463
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,320
## And five, and six, and seven

464
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,200
## Oh, me ol' bamboo, me ol' bamboo

465
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,920
## You better never bother
with me ol' bamboo

466
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,520
## You can have me hat
or me bumbershoot

467
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:28,880
## But you better never bother
with me ol' bamboo

468
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,880
You better never bother
with me ol' bamboo!

469
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,320
- Thank you.
- Here.

470
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,800
- Thank you very much.
- And thank you.

471
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,040
It's Daddy. He's got the car.

472
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:04,840
I got it.

473
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,080
He's got the car!

474
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,520
Come on.

475
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,680
Hello!

476
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:29,080
What do you think of this?
Isn't she a beauty?

477
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:31,480
That's a nice pile of junk, my boy.

478
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:35,400
It needs a little work,
but there's a fine engine under here.

479
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:39,640
- It doesn't go, though, does it?
- Not yet, but it will.

480
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,880
You can make it go, can't you?

481
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:45,080
We're gonna give it a try.
Put a hand to the wheel.

482
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:47,000
George, give us a hand here.

483
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:51,120
- OK, heave!
- We're off! Hurray!

484
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,000
Comfortable, Grandpa?

485
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:03,440
It won't work, of course.
Another catastrophe.

486
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,000
- Left hand down.
- Come on, Grandpa, push.

487
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:08,960
Watch it, Jeremy.
Mind the bicycle.

488
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,440
Ah, good. Keep coming. That's it.

489
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:15,320
Watch out, Edison.
Keep coming.

490
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:19,520
- All right, governor?
- Many thanks, George.

491
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,960
- Now...
- Can we stay and watch?

492
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:25,920
We'd better go. You know what
your dad's like when he's working.

493
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,440
- But we wanted to stay and watch.
- I'll make you a nice cup of tea.

494
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:32,160
Don't overdo it, my boy.

495
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:35,440
- Right.
- You might exhaust yourself.

496
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:04,560
Come on!

497
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:22,560
"And the big brown bear
came lolloping over the mountain."

498
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,640
"No, the princess cried..."

499
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:51,960
"And the big brown bear
came lolloping over the mountain."

500
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:31,800
It's awfully quiet in there.

501
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:34,920
- Breakfast is ready.
- He's been there for days!

502
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,960
Come and have your breakfast.

503
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,360
Daddy said the car
would be finished today.

504
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:44,640
You'll be waiting a month of Sundays
before he's finished that. Come on.

505
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:11,840
- That's Daddy!
- He's finished the car!

506
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,880
- Gosh!
- Oh!

507
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,480
What do you think?

508
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:24,440
She's the most beautiful thing
I ever saw in my life.

509
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:27,920
It's wonderful.
Daddy, you're so clever.

510
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,080
- Can we go for a drive?
- A drive?

511
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:34,240
I have a better idea.
How about a picnic?

512
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:37,280
Let's get cracking.
You get the basket.

513
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:39,320
Get in, Jemima.

514
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,640
Mind the woodwork.

515
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:44,880
- Don't touch the horn.
- Here's the basket.

516
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:48,680
Put it on the back.
Don't touch that.

517
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:54,240
Grandpa, come on.
We're going on a picnic.

518
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:58,960
It'll never go, my dears.
Not if he's had anything to do with it.

519
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,240
But it is going.

520
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:03,920
Then it'll never stop.
Anyway, it's far too hot.

521
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
- Where are you going?
- Me?

522
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,440
I'm off to Alaska, me boy. Cheerio.

523
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:10,880
Goodbye, Grandpa.
Come on, Daddy.

524
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,560
- We're off.
- We're off!

525
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,280
Sit down, Jemima.
Are you ready?

526
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:19,960
- Yes!
- Here we go.

527
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,520
Mind your back, Grandpa.

528
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,600
Bye, Grandpa.

529
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,160
Nasty, smelly things, motor cars.

530
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:40,040
- What a funny noise it's making.
- It's talking to us.

531
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:42,400
- All engines talk.
- What's it saying?

532
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:43,840
It's saying...

533
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,080
Chitty chitty, chitty chitty, chitty chitty,
chitty chitty, chitty chitty, chitty chitty.

534
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,200

00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:24,920
- Daddy!
- Look out!

573
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:34,800
A slight squeeze on the hooter
is an excellent safety precaution.

574
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:38,560
Never mind about that.
How am I supposed to get out of here?

575
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:41,200
Well...

576
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:44,120
Looks to me as if you'll
have to walk or swim.

577
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:48,120
In this dress?
Don't be ridiculous.

578
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,360
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

579
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:00,360
- I'm gonna carry you.
- Must you?

580
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:02,960
Unless you'd rather ride piggyback.

581
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:06,440
- All right, you may carry me.
- Good.

582
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,680
Wait, my handbag.

583
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:16,920
It's all right.

584
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:20,680
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

585
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:22,840
- We're going to the seaside.
- On a picnic.

586
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:24,760
- Come with us.
- Please.

587
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:27,240
I'm hardly In the mood for a picnic.

588
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:30,720
I can have Mr Coggins tow out your car.

589
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,640
- We've got sausage tarts.
- And marmalade rolls.

590
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:37,480
I got it a little mixed up.

591
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:42,200
What an unusual car.

592
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:44,440
Daddy made it.

593
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:48,000
- And it actually goes?
- It's called Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.

594
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:50,360
That's a curious name for a motor car.

595
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:53,880
But that's the sound it makes. Listen.

596

Even if we didn't know your name,
we could have guessed it.

625
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:24,320
- Oh?

- Mr Potts?
- Somebody call?

668
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:58,600
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

669
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:03,080
- What are you doing?
- Just tinkering.

670
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:08,400
You know, Mr Potts,
you have two wonderful children.

671
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:12,640
Why, thank you.
I must agree with you there.

672
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:17,120
Isn't it beautiful?

673
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:21,200
Lovely. Just lovely.

674
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:26,080
Jeremy, it's not nice to peek.

675
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:28,280
I'm not peeking. I'm looking.

676
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:31,280
- Do you think they like each other?
- Of course they do.

677
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:34,320
- Are they going to get married?
- Has he kissed her yet?

678
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:35,680
Not yet.

679
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:39,640
Just as soon as he kisses her,
then they'll have to get married.

680
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:49,200
- Jeremy, what are you doing?
- Keeping a look-out for pirates.

681
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:51,760
There aren't any pirates
round here, are there?

682
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:54,240
I'm sure there are.
Hundreds of them.

683
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:58,120
Of course there are. This is where
they bury their treasure, isn't it?

684
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:01,400
- Mm-hm.
- Tell us a story about pirates.

685
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:04,840
A story about pirates?

686
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:06,920
Let me see.

687
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,480
I can see a boat.

688
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:12,800
A boat?

689
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:15,480
Did you say a boat?

690
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:19,120
- That isn't just any old boat out there.
- No?

691
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:23,240
Zat iz ze private yacht
of ze notorious Baron Bomburst.

692
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:24,960
Baron Bomburst?

693
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:27,440
You haf never heard
of Baron Bomburst?

694
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:31,320
Ruler of Vulgaria?
Ze most evil man in ze world.

695
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:32,920
- Gosh!
- Ja.

696
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,280
Und he has sailed all ze way to England,

697
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:39,160
because he has heard tell
of a fantastic motor car

698
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:42,520
built by zat brilliant inventor,
Caractacus Potts.

699
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,880
- Hurray!
- Yes, hurray.

700
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:51,640
Und he has come to steal ze car
und take it back to Vulgaria with him.

701
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:00,280
That car!

702
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,640
I want it. I want it!

703
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:06,360
- But, Your Excellency...
- Are you giving me an argument?

704
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:12,200
Stand by the boats, man the grappling
hooks and load the cannon.

705
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:15,720
- He's awful!
- He's terrible!

706
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:18,800
- He isn't even nice.
- He can't steal our lovely car.

707
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:21,920
- You won't let him, will you?
- They're getting closer.

708
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,320
- We've got to get away.
- Start the car.

709
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:28,480
- Quickly, before they get here!
- That's easier said than done.

710
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:31,800
- But why?
- I'll tell you.

711
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:35,240
What none of us have noticed
is while we've been sitting here

712
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:38,800
the tide has been coming in.
We're completely cut off.

713
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:43,520
What are we going to do?

714
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:47,920
- Do hurry, Mr Potts.
- Everyone stay calm.

715
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:52,520
Look! They are completely
cut off by the tide.

716
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:55,480
They will all drown.

717
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:59,520
I haven't seen a good drowning in years.

718
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:03,000
- Can I help?
- Push the throttle lever!

719
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:06,440
- Hurry, Daddy!
- Quickly, before they get here.

720
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:09,720
- Not that one. The other one.
- It won't start.

721
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:13,640
We're gonna have to swim for it.
Come on, Jemima.

722
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:17,560
- We must. Come on, Jeremy.
- Everybody over the side.

723
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:23,480
Everybody hold on.

724
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:31,840
- This is impossible.
- Well, you built it.

725
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:35,600
- You always said it was a magic car.
- I did?

726
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:38,600
- Look. It's a boat.
- I knew Chitty would save us.

727
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:41,680
Hang on, everybody. We're off.

728
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:46,120
A floating car?

729
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:48,240
What do you think of that, Chancellor?

730
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:51,280
Yabba, a car, floaten on the waterfol.

731
01:04:56,840 --> 01:05:01,000
This in my whole lifelodes,
this never could be seen, never.

732
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:04,600
It's uncategorical.

733
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:08,080
A fuel-burning oracle.

734
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:16,960
A fantasmagorical machine!

735
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:20,040
## It's more than spectacular

736
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:23,760
## To use the vernacular

737
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:25,720
- It's wizard!
- It's smashing!

738
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:29,880
## It's keen

739
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:31,920
## Oh, Chitty, you Chitty,
pretty Chitty Bang Bang

740
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,960
## Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,
we love you

741
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:35,880
## And, Chitty, our Chitty,
pretty Chitty Bang Bang

742
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:37,840
## Chitty Chitty Bang Bang loves us, too

743
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:41,880
## High Chitty, low Chitty, anywhere we go,
on Chitty Chitty we depend

744
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:43,640
## Bang bang,
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

745
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:45,960
## Our fine four-fendered friend

746
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:51,120
They're firing at us!

747
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:53,480
We'll show them something.

748
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:06,360
Follow that car!

749
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:10,560
I want that car!

750
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:12,720
I must have it!

751
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:38,840
Follow that car!

752
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:57,440
I want the car!
I must have it!

753
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:02,520
Action stations.
We're going ashore.

754
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:19,320
Get out!

755
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:24,920
Where are my two spies?

756
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,960
Ah, there you are.

757
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:29,600
Now, then.

758
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:32,520
I have a secret mission for you.

759
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:36,960
You will go ashore and capture
that motor car, understand?

760
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:39,480
Good. But...

761
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:41,640
if you fail,

762
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:44,880
I will cut off your heads.

763
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,640
Now!

764
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:49,880
I want that car.

765
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:16,480
- Now, then, vere are we?
- I haf here a map.

766
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:20,560
I know where we are, stupid!
We are in England.

767
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:23,120
And ven we are in England,
vat do ve do?

768
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:24,400
We play cricket.

769
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:28,120
No. We dress like Englishmen.

770
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:36,520
Remarkable weather we are having
for the time of the year.

771
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:38,600
Do you not think so, Cuthbort?

772
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:40,800
Indubitabably, Basil.

773
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:51,400
- You know, Mr Potts...
- Caractacus.

774
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:55,360
- It's a pretty silly name.
- I don't think so.

775
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:58,720
You know, I really owe you an apology.

776
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:01,880
You're more than just a father
to those two children.

777
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:06,960
Nursemaid, private tutor,
chief cook and bottle-washer, everything.

778
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:11,480
Except what they really need.

779
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:22,880
- It's been quite a day.
- It certainly has.

780
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:25,800
Thank you, and say goodbye
to the children for me.

781
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:27,520
Yes, I will.

782
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:32,080
- I hope we'll see you again.
- I hope so, too.

783
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:34,160
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

784
01:09:57,400 --> 01:10:04,080
## This lovely, lonely man

785
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:10,480
## I've only known a day

786
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:20,520
## I look at him
and cannot look away

787
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:25,760
## Oh, what a love

788
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:34,120
## Oh, what a lovely, lonely man

789
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:39,800
## I've met so many men

790
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:45,680
## So easy to forget

791
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:51,720
## I thought I'd grown immune to them

792
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:56,320
## And yet

793
01:10:56,400 --> 01:11:01,840
## He's such a love

794
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:08,480
## He's such a lovely, lonely man

795
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:12,280
## How did he touch my heart?

796
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:16,920
## How did this feeling start?

797
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:24,920
## This glow that feels so warm inside

798
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:32,600
## This sudden summer storm inside

799
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:40,880
## My life now has a plan

800
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:45,720
## To someday make him see

801
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:54,760
## That I need him
as much as he needs me

802
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:59,640
## Oh, what a love

803
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:06,280
## Oh, what a lovely, lonely man

804
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:41,040
## My life now has a plan

805
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:46,360
## To someday make him see

806
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:56,320
## That I need him
as much as he needs me

807
01:12:56,400 --> 01:13:02,480
## Oh, what a love

808
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:12,960
## Oh, what a lovely, lonely man

809
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:19,120
## Oh, how I love

810
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:33,480
## This one and only man

811
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:59,400
Quickly! Quickly!

812
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:01,480
Hurry! Hurry!

813
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:07,920
Come on! Hurry!

814
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:13,480
They're coming!

815
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:16,040
Get ready!

816
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:17,400
Fire!

817
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:47,680
This way!

818
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:51,600
Stop! Up!

819
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:59,240
Hup!

820
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:12,880
- They're trying to get past.
- Fine.

821
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:15,360
Get over, you halfwit.

822
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:18,280
It's Father,
and he's in one of his tempers.

823
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:21,040
- That'll be a change.
- Let him pass.

824
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:23,000
There isn't room.

825
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:25,880
Get out of the way.
Move over, you idiot.

826
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:28,520
Turn off here.

827
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:39,000
We got him!

828
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:59,000
You nincompoops! I'll have you sent
away for the rest of your lives.

829
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:03,440
I suppose you baboons have
some explanation for this outrage.

830
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:07,720
- You stupid fool!
- What have I done?

831
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:13,640
I have an idea.

832
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:25,880
Remember, we are supposed
to be English gentlemen.

833
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:29,640
So, let us try and behave
like English gentlemen.

834
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:30,760
Ja, ja, ja.

835
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:32,920
So, open the door.

836
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:42,040
"Carac-a-tacatus Potts."

837
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:44,280
"Inventor."

838
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:54,040
Typical English eccentric.

839
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:57,200
That must be the inventor.

840
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:03,400
Pardink me for protruding but have I
the pleasure of undressing Herr...

841
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:05,480
Mr Potts?

842
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:07,880
That's me.

843
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:11,640
What do you want?
You selling something?

844
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:14,320
I don't want nothing. Excuse me.

845
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:16,800
I'm off to Africa.

846
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:24,240
Africa? Zat was a ruse
to put us off ze scent.

847
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:28,280
I know where he has gone.
He has gone into his laboratory.

848
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:31,640
- Quick, the portable wireless transmitter!
- Jawohl!

849
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:41,520
Jawohl.

850
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:44,120
- This is X speaking.
- Schwecks?

851
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:45,680
- No, X!
- Legs?

852
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:48,800
- X as in...
- Eggs and bacon.

853
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:51,600
Send transport immediately.

854
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:03,880
- They're here!
- Quickly!

855
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:09,920
That way!

856
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:14,320
Quickly! This way! Quickly!

857
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:18,640
Get up the ladder! Quickly!

858
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,720
Quickly! Up! Take it up!

859
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:25,400
Now over here!

860
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:26,480
Up! Up!

861
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:32,480
Wait for me.

862
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:47,960
Hello. What's your game, then?

863
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:52,240
What's going on?

864
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:54,320
I'm flying.

865
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:01,360
- Look.
- What's that?

866
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:03,920
- It's a big balloon.
- A Zeppelin.

867
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:07,640
- What's that underneath?
- That's Grandpa's hut.

868
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:10,960
- But what's it doing up there?
- I don't know.

869
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:13,320
Caractacus, I'm being kidnapped.

870
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:16,600
What are you doing?
You come down here.

871
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:19,400
It's me, your own father.

872
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:22,520
They won't get away with that.
Hold tight back there.

873
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:24,640
- Sit down, Jeremy.
- Quickly!

874
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:25,760
Hurry, Daddy!

875
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:27,240
Caractacus!

876
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:29,320
He's getting away!

877
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:35,960
Hold on, Grandpa. We're coming!

878
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,200
Help!

879
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:41,000
Come back, Grandpa.

880
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:44,040
What do you think you're doing?

881
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:47,440
I'm being abducted by foreigners.

882
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:48,600
Caractacus!

883
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:49,920
Hey!

884
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:56,400
Where are they going?

885
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:58,360
Look out!

886
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:13,240
What's happening?

887
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:16,320
- Look at that.
- It's fantastic.

888
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:20,120
You're a genius!

889
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:22,800
It's nothing, really.

890
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:33,960
- Look! There they are.
- Go, Daddy! After them.

891
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:36,040
We'll catch 'em up.

892
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:46,760
- We've lost them.
- We'll find them.

893
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:49,880
- What about Grandpa?
- Don't worry about Grandpa.

894
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,360
He can take care of himself.

895
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:55,840
This is livin', this is style

896
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:59,960
## This is elegance by the mile

897
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:03,920
## Oh, the posh, posh travelling life,
the travelling life for me

898
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:07,800
## First cabin and captain's table,
regal company

899
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:11,480
## Whenever I'm bored, I travel abroad,
but ever so properly

900
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:17,440
## Port out, starboard home,
posh with a capital P-O-S-H, posh

901
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:20,680
We're losing height.

902
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:24,280
Jettison ballast.

903
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:30,040
## The hands that hold the sceptres,
every head that holds a crown

904
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:33,920
## They'll always give their all for me,
they'll never let me down

905
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:37,520
## I'm on my way to far away,
ta-ta and toodle-oo

906
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:41,960
## And fare thee well and bon voyage,
arrivederci, too

907
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:51,200
## Oh, the posh, posh travelling life,
the travelling life for me

908
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:54,800
## First cabin and captain's table,
regal company

909
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:58,000
## Pardon the dust of the upper crust

910
01:21:58,120 --> 01:22:00,480
## Fetch us a cup of tea

911
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:06,480
## Port out, starboard home,
posh with a capital P-O-S-H, posh

912
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:19,440
## In every foreign strand I land,
the royal trumpets toot me

913
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:22,960
## The royal welcome mat is out,
they 21-gun salute me

914
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:26,560
## But monarchies are constantly
commanding me to call

915
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:30,080
## Last month I missed a mufti,
well, you can't oblige 'em all

916
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:34,200
## Oh, the posh, posh travelling life,
the travelling life for me

917
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:37,800
## Rompity tompity
di-de-di diddly-de-de-de

918
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:39,920
We are still losing height.

919
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,360
There must be something else
we can throw out.

920
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:46,640
There's nothing else
we can throw out.

921
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:59,880
- You just dropped someone.
- I can't swim.

922
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:02,800
Come back!

923
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:08,520
## Oh, the posh, posh travelling life,
the travelling life for me

924
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:12,120
## First cabin and captain's table,
regal company

925
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:15,520
## When I'm at the helm,
the world's my realm

926
01:23:15,640 --> 01:23:18,960
## And I do it stylishly

927
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:24,400
## Port out, starboard home,
posh with a capital P-O-S-H

928
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:26,400
- Schweinhund!
- Schwasser!

929
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:28,440
- What do we do now?
- Start swimming.

930
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:31,800
- I don't swim.
- Then start drowning!

931
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:35,440
## P-O-S-H, P-O-S-H

932
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:37,600
## Posh!

933
01:23:59,320 --> 01:24:01,280
Hello.

934
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:04,000
Where are we?

935
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:06,320
Somewhere over the North Sea, I think.

936
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:08,800
Don't you know where we're going?

937
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:12,480
I don't, but Chitty does.

938
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:15,560
I think we're in pretty good hands.

939
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:43,240
Good morning.
This is your captain speaking.

940
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:44,840
We hope you had a pleasant trip.

941
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:48,000
We are about to land in Vulgaria.

942
01:24:48,120 --> 01:24:50,360
- Where?
- Vulgaria?

943
01:24:50,440 --> 01:24:53,800
Please fasten your seat belts,
and no smoking. Thank you.

944
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:57,320
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

945
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:03,600
Speed, 41/2 knots.

946
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:09,640
Wind, east-southeast.

947
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:20,800
Brigade, attention!

948
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:47,840
- We haf a guest. Welcome him.
- Jawohl, Your Excellency!

949
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:50,960
Order arms!

950
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:55,720
Professor Potts.

951
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:57,800
Please, walk zis way.

952
01:25:57,920 --> 01:25:59,960
Present arms!

953
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:18,160
On behalf of
Her Majesty the Queen, I'd like...

954
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:21,760
Excuse me.

955
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:27,920
You're early.

956
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:47,280
- Down the table and in the pocky.
- You cheat.

957
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:51,760
- Professor Potts
- Professor?

958
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:56,000
Vulgaria welcomes
ze brilliant Professor Potts,

959
01:26:56,120 --> 01:26:59,000
inventor extraordinary.

960
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:02,640
Excuse me, sir.
There seems to be some sort of mistake.

961
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:06,560
You are not Professor Potts, ze inventor?

962
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:09,040
Executioner!

963
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:16,000
What would you like me to invent, sir?

964
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:19,120
I will show you. My horse!

965
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:22,200
Get the horse for His Excellency.

966
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:30,800
Gee up!

967
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:49,440
How proud you look on that fine horse.

968
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:53,560
The most beautiful toy
you ever bought me, my darling.

969
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:58,120
- But, who is this?
- Professor Potts from England.

970
01:27:58,200 --> 01:28:01,960
I think we haf a surprise for you.
Eh, Professor?

971
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:04,280
- Come on.
- Adieu.

972
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:13,000
Vat do you think, Professor?
Everything you need.

973
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:18,440
These will be your assistants.
And this is the baronial car.

974
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:21,520
Can you make zis car float?

975
01:28:21,640 --> 01:28:25,320
Like ampfibial English motee car.
Float over the cresty wave of the wart.

976
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:28,120
It's not that easy without my laboratory.

977
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:30,360
I have already thought of that.

978
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:33,000
Here is your laboratory.

979
01:28:36,440 --> 01:28:39,160
If you succeed in making the car float,

980
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:43,200
I will make you privy counsellor.

981
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:50,480
But if you fail, I will stuff your head
wiz sauerkraut and feed it to the dogs.

982
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:54,720
Feedy dorribles, snarly snort horribold.

983
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:56,680
You haf got 24 hours.

984
01:28:56,800 --> 01:29:00,480
24 hours and worky nosey grindstone.

985
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:07,400
Proper card, he is.

986
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:09,320
Odd sense of humour.

987
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:12,400
Stuff me head with sauerkraut.

988
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:15,080
The baron never makes jokes.

989
01:29:15,160 --> 01:29:18,760
Look at us.
We've been here for years and years.

990
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:21,360
I came here to repair the telephone.

991
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:24,880
That was 24 years ago.

992
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,640
They have terrible tortures.

993
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:30,880
The thumbscrew and the rack.

994
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:34,960
They stretch you and stretch you.

995
01:29:35,080 --> 01:29:39,040
When I first came here, I was a midget.

996
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:43,240
Phaw!

997
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:47,240
But, I mean, a floating car!

998
01:29:47,360 --> 01:29:49,200
That's impossible!

999
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:52,960
- Nothing's impossible.
- That's what my son's always saying.

1000
01:29:53,080 --> 01:29:55,760
We'll help you, won't we, lads?

1001
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:59,120
Nil desperandum.
We'll succeed. You'll see.

1002
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:01,320
Courage, man.

1003
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:04,760
## Every bursted bubble has a glory

1004
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:08,600
## Each abysmal failure makes a point

1005
01:30:08,680 --> 01:30:12,240
## Every glowing path that goes astray

1006
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:15,680
## Shows you how to find a better way

1007
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:19,520
## So every time you stumble,
never grumble

1008
01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:22,720
## Next time you'll bumble even less

1009
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:27,040
## For up from the ashes,
up from the ashes

1010
01:30:27,160 --> 01:30:30,160
## Grow the roses of success

1011
01:30:30,240 --> 01:30:33,760
## Grow the roses

1012
01:30:33,880 --> 01:30:36,400
## Grow the roses of success

1013
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:37,240
## Oh, yes

1014
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:39,000
## Grow the roses

1015
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:40,960
## Those rosy roses

1016
01:30:41,080 --> 01:30:45,160
## From the ashes of disaster
grow the roses of success

1017
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:48,320
- But he wants it to float.
- It will.

1018
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:50,320
## For every big mistake you make,

1019
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:52,240
- ## Be grateful
- ## Hear, hear

1020
01:30:52,360 --> 01:30:55,480
- ## That mistake you'll never make again
- ## No, sir

1021
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:59,040
## Every shiny dream that fades and dies

1022
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:02,800
## Generates the steam for two more tries

1023
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:05,640
## There's magic in the wake of a fiasco

1024
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:06,240
## Correct

1025
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:08,920
## It gives you that chance to second-guess

1026
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:09,760
## Oh, yes

1027
01:31:09,880 --> 01:31:13,560
- ## Then up from the ashes
- ## Up from the ashes

1028
01:31:14,240 --> 01:31:16,440
## Grow the roses of success

1029
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:20,640
## Grow the roses

1030
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:23,360
## Grow the roses of success

1031
01:31:24,160 --> 01:31:25,760
## Grow the roses

1032
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:27,680
## Those rosy roses

1033
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:32,160
## From the ashes of disaster
grow the roses of success

1034
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:38,680
- ## Disaster didn't stymie Louis Pasteur
- ## No, sir

1035
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:42,640
- ## Edison took years to see the light
- ## Right

1036
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:45,720
## Alexander Graham knew failure well

1037
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:49,520
## He took a lot of knocks to ring that bell

1038
01:31:49,640 --> 01:31:53,040
## So when it gets distressing,
it's a blessing

1039
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:56,360
## Onward and upward you must press,
yes, yes

1040
01:31:56,440 --> 01:31:58,600
## Till up from the ashes

1041
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:00,600
## Up from the ashes

1042
01:32:00,680 --> 01:32:03,480
## Grow the roses of success

1043
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:05,360
## Grow the ro...

1044
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:07,200
## Grow the roses

1045
01:32:07,320 --> 01:32:08,920
## Grow the ro...

1046
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:10,760
## Grow the roses

1047
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:13,040
## Grow the roses of success

1048
01:32:14,360 --> 01:32:16,200
## Grow the ro...

1049
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:17,600
## Grow the roses

1050
01:32:17,680 --> 01:32:19,400
## Those rosy ro...

1051
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:21,360
## Those rosy roses

1052
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:24,360
## From the ashes of disaster

1053
01:32:24,440 --> 01:32:27,120
## Grow the roses

1054
01:32:27,200 --> 01:32:29,280
## Of success!

1055
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:30,920
- Start the engine.
- ## Success!

1056
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:32,720
- Batten the hatches.
- ## Success!

1057
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:34,640
Man the shrouds!

1058
01:32:34,760 --> 01:32:36,800
Lift the anchor!

1059
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:41,200
## Success!

1060
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:56,960
Oh, Daddy, we'll never find him.

1061
01:32:57,080 --> 01:32:59,440
We must keep looking.

1062
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:01,880
Look! What's that down there?

1063
01:33:02,240 --> 01:33:03,480
A- ha!

1064
01:33:04,240 --> 01:33:06,240
Let's have a look.

1065
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:13,640
Look!

1066
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:16,920
- The Zeppelin!
- We've found Grandpa.

1067
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,880
Not yet we haven't.

1068
01:33:34,760 --> 01:33:36,960
What's happening?

1069
01:33:37,080 --> 01:33:39,760
- Remarkable!
- Your Excellency...

1070
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:42,080
- We are being attacked.
- Attacked?

1071
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:43,520
Attack! Attack!

1072
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:46,480
That was that terrible Bomburst!

1073
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:48,880
It certainly was.

1074
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,040
- Where are they going?
- It's a car!

1075
01:33:51,160 --> 01:33:52,520
Where did they go?

1076
01:33:54,640 --> 01:33:57,240
How floaty in the heavenly abode,
fully peoplebodies.

1077
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:00,760
Fire!

1078
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:04,560
What's the matter with you?
You want to destroy my beautiful car?

1079
01:34:05,160 --> 01:34:07,000
They're firing at us.

1080
01:34:07,120 --> 01:34:10,400
There are children up there.

1081
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:12,440
We'd better get away from here.

1082
01:34:14,360 --> 01:34:17,560
Hang on, everybody.
We're coming in to land.

1083
01:34:17,640 --> 01:34:21,280
Your Excellency,
it's landing in the village.

1084
01:34:21,360 --> 01:34:23,680
Call out the guards!

1085
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:35,080
And call out the child catcher!

1086
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:42,400
Charge!

1087
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:48,800
Charge!

1088
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:54,440
Let me in.

1089
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:08,160
We made it!

1090
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:12,400
- Isn't Chitty wonderful?
- You're clever, Daddy.

1091
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:14,880
Yes, he certainly is.

1092
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,200
You all stay here.
I'm going to the castle.

1093
01:35:17,320 --> 01:35:19,720
- We want to come too.
- To help you find Grandpa.

1094
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:22,480
Don't you think
we ought to stay together?

1095
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:25,640
- Maybe you're right.
- Come on, children.

1096
01:35:28,360 --> 01:35:30,640
- I wonder where we are.
- I don't know.

1097
01:35:31,240 --> 01:35:32,840
Come on.

1098
01:35:36,920 --> 01:35:39,880
Pardon me, sir. The castle?

1099
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,800
- Le chateau?
- Der Schloss?

1100
01:35:44,360 --> 01:35:47,320
What's the matter with him?

1101
01:35:47,400 --> 01:35:49,400
Come on.

1102
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:21,640
What are they staring at?

1103
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:23,920
I don't know.

1104
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:28,880
It seems to be the children.

1105
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,960
Haven't they seen children before?

1106
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:35,680
Haven't you noticed?

1107
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:38,040
There aren't any children.

1108
01:36:39,240 --> 01:36:41,000
Not one.

1109
01:36:46,440 --> 01:36:48,480
What's going on?

1110
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,720
Hey, you, what's happening?

1111
01:36:54,120 --> 01:36:55,680
Soldiers! Soldiers!

1112
01:37:04,160 --> 01:37:06,120
Hey, you there!

1113
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:09,360
- Get the children in here.
- Can you tell me what's happening?

1114
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:11,640
Quickly, before the soldiers get here.

1115
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:16,360
Come, Fraulein.
Get inside, quickly.

1116
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:22,440
We must hide the children.
The soldiers will take them away.

1117
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:24,160
But why?

1118
01:37:24,240 --> 01:37:26,960
Nobody's allowed
to have children in Vulgaria.

1119
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:31,960
- But what about all these toys?
- The baroness hates children.

1120
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:35,280
Quickly, down there.
And don't make a sound.

1121
01:37:54,120 --> 01:37:58,240
I want every house in this square
to be searched from top to bottom.

1122
01:37:58,360 --> 01:38:00,480
First section, step out there and search.

1123
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:04,840
Second section, over there.
Section three, over there.

1124
01:38:06,240 --> 01:38:08,320
Search everywhere!

1125
01:38:11,360 --> 01:38:12,880
Giddap!

1126
01:38:18,200 --> 01:38:22,520
There are children here somewhere.

1127
01:38:22,640 --> 01:38:25,680
I can smell them.

1128
01:38:26,360 --> 01:38:28,480
Aaah-ha!

1129
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:31,120
Captain!

1130
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:34,200
I think we've got them.

1131
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:37,920
- Lieutenant!
- Break down this door.

1132
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:40,560
Get this door open.

1133
01:38:40,640 --> 01:38:42,320
All right. I'm coming.

1134
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:45,080
Bang the door down! Quickly!

1135
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:48,360
You've no right to come in here!

1136
01:38:48,440 --> 01:38:50,960
- Search the place!
- Search! Search!

1137
01:38:53,080 --> 01:38:55,000
A- ha!

1138
01:38:55,400 --> 01:38:58,040
They are here somewhere.

1139
01:38:58,160 --> 01:39:00,840
I can feel it in my bones.

1140
01:39:00,920 --> 01:39:03,800
There are children here.

1141
01:39:03,880 --> 01:39:08,200
Children in a toy shop.
Such a notion. I mean...

1142
01:39:08,320 --> 01:39:11,720
What are you doing?
That's for the baron's birthday.

1143
01:39:11,800 --> 01:39:15,160
Let me tell you, toymaker.

1144
01:39:15,240 --> 01:39:19,600
This nose of mine has never failed me.

1145
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:24,720
And if there are children here, my friend,

1146
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:28,160
you will die.

1147
01:39:32,160 --> 01:39:34,120
A- ha!

1148
01:39:36,920 --> 01:39:40,520
Quick, open it up.
Get down there and search the cellar.

1149
01:39:43,640 --> 01:39:46,640
The baroness will have
your teeth for a necklace

1150
01:39:46,760 --> 01:39:49,680
and your eyeballs for earrings.

1151
01:39:49,800 --> 01:39:55,200
- Nobody down here.
- Fool. Idiot. Out of my way.

1152
01:39:55,320 --> 01:39:59,320
You have to know where to look.

1153
01:39:59,400 --> 01:40:03,640
Like cockroaches
they get under the floors,

1154
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:06,160
in the cracks in the walls,

1155
01:40:06,240 --> 01:40:09,040
in the woodwork.

1156
01:40:45,640 --> 01:40:49,560
I don't trust a man who makes toys

1157
01:40:49,640 --> 01:40:54,480
in a land where children are forbidden.

1158
01:40:54,600 --> 01:40:57,760
Every toy I make is exclusively
for His Excellency the Baron.

1159
01:40:57,880 --> 01:41:01,720
Captain, ze flying car.
We've captured ze flying car.

1160
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:03,480
Fall in! Fall in!

1161
01:41:22,120 --> 01:41:24,160
Take zis car to the castle.

1162
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:31,480
- They can't take Chitty.
- Daddy, do something.

1163
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:34,600
- What are you going to do?
- I'm not just gonna stand here.

1164
01:41:34,680 --> 01:41:38,720
Are you mad? Are you going to take on
the whole army single-handed?

1165
01:41:46,360 --> 01:41:48,800
What kind of a country is this?

1166
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:50,720
No children.

1167
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:53,280
Everybody terrified out of their lives.

1168
01:41:53,360 --> 01:41:55,760
My friend, take some good advice.

1169
01:41:55,880 --> 01:41:59,680
Take your children and your good lady
and get out of Vulgaria.

1170
01:41:59,800 --> 01:42:04,080
And leave Grandpa up in the castle?
We need to get him out.

1171
01:42:04,160 --> 01:42:07,160
- Just tell me how to get there.
- I'm only a toymaker.

1172
01:42:07,240 --> 01:42:11,320
If I don't finish this for the baron's
birthday, I shall be a dead toymaker.

1173
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:14,720
I'll go myself.
Truly, you stay here with the children.

1174
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:16,800
All right, all right.

1175
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:23,880
You don't know
what you're letting yourself in for.

1176
01:42:25,240 --> 01:42:28,960
- Here's one for you, one for you.
- Thank you, toymaker.

1177
01:42:29,080 --> 01:42:31,240
Keep them out of sight, please.

1178
01:42:31,360 --> 01:42:33,440
You be good and do what Truly tells you.

1179
01:42:33,560 --> 01:42:35,200
- We will.
- Yes, Daddy.

1180
01:42:35,640 --> 01:42:38,320
Are you coming?

1181
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:51,680
Come.

1182
01:42:57,760 --> 01:43:00,080
Quickly!

1183
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:06,120
There isn't a scrap of food in the place.

1184
01:43:06,200 --> 01:43:10,520
- I'm so hungry, my tummy hurts.
- Mine is making funny noises.

1185
01:43:10,640 --> 01:43:12,960
I simply must find something for you.

1186
01:43:13,080 --> 01:43:15,720
Promise not to move
from here until I come back.

1187
01:43:15,800 --> 01:43:17,880
- We promise, don't we?
- Yes.

1188
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,720
Remember, you stay right here.

1189
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:30,600
To get in that way,
you have to be a mouse, or a magician.

1190
01:43:36,680 --> 01:43:39,800
We should go down now
before a sentry sees us.

1191
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:42,080
Come. Come.

1192
01:43:45,400 --> 01:43:47,400
The flying car.

1193
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:51,560
At last it's mine.

1194
01:43:51,640 --> 01:43:54,640
Send for the inventor.

1195
01:43:55,160 --> 01:43:57,160
Now, then, fly.

1196
01:43:57,240 --> 01:43:59,000
- Yes, fly.
- Fly.

1197
01:43:59,120 --> 01:44:01,160
- Come on. Fly.
- Fly, fly, fly.

1198
01:44:02,160 --> 01:44:04,160
I command you to fly!

1199
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:06,080
Watch it.

1200
01:44:06,160 --> 01:44:09,160
- Over here.
- Hello! What's this doing here?

1201
01:44:09,240 --> 01:44:12,760
You are the inventor.
Make this car fly.

1202
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:16,160
Make it fly. Go on. Get in.

1203
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:21,480
Stand back, everyone.
We are going to fly.

1204
01:44:21,600 --> 01:44:24,600
Yoo-hoo, Bombie, wait for me!

1205
01:44:24,680 --> 01:44:27,960
Every time I want to have
a little fun, she turns up.

1206
01:44:30,760 --> 01:44:33,640
My darling, we are going for a fly.

1207
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:37,720
How exciting. Fly. How thrilling.

1208
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:40,840
- Hurry up.
- I am doing my best, sir.

1209
01:44:40,920 --> 01:44:43,840
Just a minute.
Here's one we haven't tried.

1210
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:46,480
- Here we go, my beloved.
- Hold on!

1211
01:44:48,160 --> 01:44:50,840
Isn't it exciting, my dear?

1212
01:44:56,200 --> 01:44:59,040
You are a genius.
Bring my guns.

1213
01:44:59,160 --> 01:45:01,920
Don't worry, little pigeon.
I'll get you down.

1214
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:05,440
I've been waiting for this for 20 years.

1215
01:45:06,120 --> 01:45:09,440
Are you still there, my love?
Don't move.

1216
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:20,800
There she is, Your Excellency.

1217
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:23,040
My diamonds!

1218
01:45:23,160 --> 01:45:25,360
Are you all right, my dear?

1219
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,520
I'm all right, my dumpling.

1220
01:45:29,160 --> 01:45:32,360
Good. Never mind.
I'll get her the next time.

1221
01:45:47,800 --> 01:45:53,120
Here we are, children.
Come and get your lollipops.

1222
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:56,600
Lollipops.

1223
01:45:56,680 --> 01:45:59,400
Come along, my little ones.

1224
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:01,480
Lollipops.

1225
01:46:04,680 --> 01:46:08,880
Ice cream. Chocolate.
All free today.

1226
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,040
Listen.

1227
01:46:13,200 --> 01:46:14,600
What's that?

1228
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:22,280
Children, where are you?

1229
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:26,960
I know you're here somewhere.

1230
01:46:28,640 --> 01:46:33,200
I've lots of lovely goodies for you.

1231
01:46:33,320 --> 01:46:35,880
Jeremy, you mustn't.

1232
01:46:39,320 --> 01:46:41,280
Lollipops.

1233
01:46:42,120 --> 01:46:46,320
And all free today.

1234
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:48,080
Cherry pies,

1235
01:46:48,160 --> 01:46:50,200
cream puffs,

1236
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:51,920
ice cream,

1237
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:53,800
treacle tarts.

1238
01:46:53,880 --> 01:46:56,680
- Treacle tarts.
- And ice creams.

1239
01:46:56,800 --> 01:46:58,360
And all free.

1240
01:46:58,440 --> 01:47:02,240
Come along, kiddiwinkies.

1241
01:47:02,760 --> 01:47:06,120
- Come on.
- Truly said we mustn't.

1242
01:47:06,200 --> 01:47:09,240
We'll get Truly some as well.

1243
01:47:12,600 --> 01:47:14,520
Mr Man...

1244
01:47:15,160 --> 01:47:18,000
Children, come back.

1245
01:47:20,560 --> 01:47:22,520
Children, come back here.

1246
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:27,520
Come along, my little dears,

1247
01:47:27,640 --> 01:47:29,400
my little mice.

1248
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:31,480
Come to me.

1249
01:47:32,320 --> 01:47:34,880
What will it be? Ice cream?

1250
01:47:34,920 --> 01:47:39,040
Strawberry, chocolate, vanilla.
It's all inside.

1251
01:47:39,160 --> 01:47:41,200
Come along, my little dears.

1252
01:47:41,320 --> 01:47:43,640
Not a penny to pay.

1253
01:47:43,760 --> 01:47:46,480
Go inside, my little dears.

1254
01:48:05,800 --> 01:48:07,480
Children!

1255
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:13,360
Truly.

1256
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:14,920
Help! Help!

1257
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:18,400
- What's happened?
- He took the children.

1258
01:48:23,160 --> 01:48:26,000
Your Excellency.

1259
01:48:26,120 --> 01:48:28,680
- Let us out.
- Silence.

1260
01:48:39,200 --> 01:48:42,120
Children, Your Highness.

1261
01:48:42,200 --> 01:48:46,560
Foreign children. Unique specimens.

1262
01:48:46,640 --> 01:48:49,000
You're sure they can't get out?

1263
01:48:49,120 --> 01:48:51,080
No, Your Highness.

1264
01:48:52,160 --> 01:48:57,080
Perhaps Your Highness
would care to examine them.

1265
01:48:57,160 --> 01:49:02,440
Nasty little creatures.
Very, very treacherous. Foreign.

1266
01:49:04,480 --> 01:49:10,280
- Wait till our daddy hears about this.
- He'll blow up the whole castle.

1267
01:49:10,360 --> 01:49:13,360
Take them away to the tower.

1268
01:49:14,400 --> 01:49:16,600
You're a nasty, horrid, mean old lady.

1269
01:49:16,680 --> 01:49:19,640
And very ugly.

1270
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:22,120
Oh, she's going.

1271
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:52,960
200 feet above us through that solid rock
is the castle of Baron Bomburst.

1272
01:50:23,160 --> 01:50:25,160
These are our children.

1273
01:50:25,240 --> 01:50:30,120
For five years, we have hidden them here.

1274
01:50:30,200 --> 01:50:35,800
They don't know what a tree looks like
or what it is to run in the sunshine.

1275
01:50:37,800 --> 01:50:39,800
Food.

1276
01:50:39,880 --> 01:50:42,280
There's bread for everyone.

1277
01:50:42,360 --> 01:50:48,360
Like little rats, they run up and down the
sewers, stealing food from the kitchens.

1278
01:50:48,440 --> 01:50:50,680
Here, catch!

1279
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:53,080
Son!

1280
01:50:53,640 --> 01:50:57,520
I think my children are up there
in the castle with their grandfather.

1281
01:50:57,640 --> 01:51:00,280
- Have you seen them?
- No, sir.

1282
01:51:00,360 --> 01:51:02,280
- A little boy and girl?
- Yes.

1283
01:51:02,360 --> 01:51:04,480
They're locked up in the tower.

1284
01:51:04,600 --> 01:51:07,880
- And the grandfather?
- In the dungeon.

1285
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,800
Sir, have you come to help us?

1286
01:51:15,600 --> 01:51:18,560
Are you going to take us out of here?

1287
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:24,040
- What's your name, son?
- Peter, sir.

1288
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:29,400
Peter, you shouldn't be afraid,
even in a terrible place like this.

1289
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:33,080
Because there's always hope.

1290
01:51:33,160 --> 01:51:37,760
That's what I always tell my children
when they're afraid.

1291
01:51:41,880 --> 01:51:48,560
## A gentle breeze
from Hushabye Mountain

1292
01:51:48,640 --> 01:51:56,040
## Softly blows o'er Lullaby Bay

1293
01:51:56,160 --> 01:52:02,680
## It fills the sails
of boats that are waiting

1294
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:06,960
## Waiting to sail...

1295
01:52:09,320 --> 01:52:18,080
## So close your eyes
on Hushabye Mountain

1296
01:52:18,160 --> 01:52:25,080
## Wave goodbye
to cares of the day

1297
01:52:25,160 --> 01:52:34,120
## And watch your boat
from Hushabye Mountain

1298
01:52:34,200 --> 01:52:46,920
## Sail far away from Lullaby Bay

1299
01:52:48,600 --> 01:52:51,720
Is that the only advice
you have to offer?

1300
01:52:51,800 --> 01:52:57,120
It's a beautiful dream, but I don't see
how it's going to help them.

1301
01:52:57,200 --> 01:53:00,200
We're gonna get up into that castle.

1302
01:53:00,320 --> 01:53:03,000
- It is impossible.
- We'll see.

1303
01:53:03,120 --> 01:53:05,520
Everybody listen to me.

1304
01:53:05,640 --> 01:53:09,080
- You want to get out of here, don't you?
- Yes!

1305
01:53:10,120 --> 01:53:12,880
Tomorrow
is Baron Bomburst's birthday, yes?

1306
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:14,960
Boo!

1307
01:53:16,240 --> 01:53:19,520
We'll give him a party he'll never forget.

1308
01:53:19,640 --> 01:53:23,800
Everybody gather around here.
I have an idea.

1309
01:53:36,120 --> 01:53:41,120
## Happy birthday to me

1310
01:53:41,200 --> 01:53:45,280
## Happy birthday, dear Bombie

1311
01:53:45,600 --> 01:53:47,600
Don't move.

1312
01:53:47,680 --> 01:53:49,760
What a picture.

1313
01:53:49,880 --> 01:53:52,200
Such memories it brings back.

1314
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:56,680
My little dumpling.

1315
01:53:56,800 --> 01:53:58,960
My Liebling.

1316
01:53:59,080 --> 01:54:02,640
## You're my little chu-chi face

1317
01:54:02,760 --> 01:54:06,960
## My kootchi, kootchi,
wootchi little chu-chi face

1318
01:54:07,080 --> 01:54:13,440
## Every time I look at you I sigh

1319
01:54:14,160 --> 01:54:18,120
## And you're my little teddy bear

1320
01:54:18,200 --> 01:54:21,960
## My lovey, lovey dovey little teddy bear

1321
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:28,240
## You're the Apfel Streudel of mein eye

1322
01:54:29,640 --> 01:54:33,520
## Your chu-chi, wootchi nose,
your chu-chi, wootchi eyes

1323
01:54:33,640 --> 01:54:37,200
## They set my heart a-flutter

1324
01:54:37,320 --> 01:54:41,200
## Your ootchi, kootchi ways,
your ootchi, kootchi gaze

1325
01:54:41,320 --> 01:54:48,200
## Wilts me down like meltings butter

1326
01:54:50,600 --> 01:54:53,760
## You're my little chu-chi face

1327
01:54:53,880 --> 01:54:58,080
## And you're my teddy bear

1328
01:54:58,160 --> 01:55:04,200
## Together we're a chu-chi, wootchi,
ootchi, kootchi pair

1329
01:55:21,200 --> 01:55:25,040
## Whatever you may ask
becomes my happy task

1330
01:55:25,160 --> 01:55:28,520
## I only live to serve you

1331
01:55:28,640 --> 01:55:32,640
## I never will divine
what magic made you mine

1332
01:55:32,760 --> 01:55:39,880
## I only know
I don't deserve you

1333
01:55:41,240 --> 01:55:43,240
Ha, ha, ha!

1334
01:55:47,800 --> 01:55:51,200
## You're my little chu-chi face

1335
01:55:51,320 --> 01:55:55,120
## And you're my teddy bear

1336
01:55:55,200 --> 01:55:59,800
## Together we're a chu-chi,
wootchi, ootchi, kootchi

1337
01:56:00,480 --> 01:56:02,160
- ## Chu-chi
- ## Wootchi

1338
01:56:02,240 --> 01:56:03,640
- ## Ootchi
- ## Kootchi

1339
01:56:04,360 --> 01:56:08,880
## Chu-chi, wootchi, ootchi, kootchi

1340
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:10,960
## Pair

1341
01:57:01,320 --> 01:57:03,480
What a rotten birthday party.

1342
01:57:03,600 --> 01:57:06,600
Never mind, my little Bombie.

1343
01:57:06,680 --> 01:57:08,840
I have a surprise for you.

1344
01:57:08,920 --> 01:57:12,840
Surprises! Oh, I love surprises.

1345
01:57:12,920 --> 01:57:16,000
Sit down quickly.

1346
01:57:17,520 --> 01:57:22,560
Summon the toymaker.

1347
01:57:25,640 --> 01:57:28,440
Hurry up. Don't waste time.

1348
01:57:33,880 --> 01:57:38,360
Your Excellency, may I wish you all you
wish yourself on this happy occasion.

1349
01:57:38,440 --> 01:57:42,400
Never mind that.
What have you made me for my birthday?

1350
01:57:42,480 --> 01:57:47,400
What have I made you? Such a toy.
A work of mechanical perfection.

1351
01:57:47,520 --> 01:57:50,200
Where is it? Bring it in.

1352
01:57:50,320 --> 01:57:55,320
Right away. I'll get it for you.
Bring in the baron's birthday present.

1353
01:58:05,600 --> 01:58:09,920
This year, Your Excellency,
I have surpassed even myself.

1354
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:14,160
Put it down there. Careful with it.

1355
01:58:14,240 --> 01:58:18,960
For months I have been working
night and day perfecting every little detail

1356
01:58:19,080 --> 01:58:21,800
to bring you this.

1357
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:28,000
Dolls? Dolls?

1358
01:58:28,120 --> 01:58:32,200
I have hundreds of dolls.

1359
01:58:32,560 --> 01:58:37,760
But this is not just
an ordinary doll, Your Excellency.

1360
01:58:41,600 --> 01:58:43,560
You see?

1361
01:58:49,920 --> 01:58:56,080
## What do you see,
you people gazing at me

1362
01:58:57,400 --> 01:59:03,280
## You see a doll on a music box
that's wound by a key

1363
01:59:04,920 --> 01:59:11,360
## How can you tell
I'm under a spell

1364
01:59:11,440 --> 01:59:17,440
## I'm waiting for love's first kiss

1365
01:59:19,800 --> 01:59:27,320
## You cannot see
how much I long to be free

1366
01:59:27,400 --> 01:59:34,920
## Turning around on this music box
that's wound by a key

1367
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:42,440
## Yearning, yearning

1368
01:59:42,560 --> 01:59:49,800
## While I'm turning around and around

1369
02:02:10,920 --> 02:02:13,400
- ## What do you see
- ## Truly Scrumptious

1370
02:02:13,520 --> 02:02:18,560
- ## You people gazing at me
- ## You're truly, truly scrumptious

1371
02:02:18,640 --> 02:02:21,720
- ## You see a doll on a music box
- ## Scrumptious as...

1372
02:02:21,800 --> 02:02:24,800
## That's wound by a key

1373
02:02:26,080 --> 02:02:28,840
## How can you tell

1374
02:02:28,920 --> 02:02:32,480
## I'm under a spell

1375
02:02:32,600 --> 02:02:36,400
- ## I'm waiting for love's
- ## Honest, Truly

1376
02:02:36,480 --> 02:02:41,080
- ## First kiss
- ## You're the answer to my wishes

1377
02:02:41,160 --> 02:02:43,520
- ## You cannot see
- ## Truly Scrumptious

1378
02:02:43,640 --> 02:02:48,600
- ## How much I long to be free
- ## Though I may seem presumptuous

1379
02:02:48,680 --> 02:02:51,960
- ## Turning around on this music box
- ## Ne...

1380
02:02:52,080 --> 02:02:55,120
## That's wound by a key

1381
02:02:55,880 --> 02:02:59,840
- ## Yearning
- ## My heart beats so unruly

1382
02:02:59,920 --> 02:03:03,360
- ## Yearning
- ## Because I love you truly

1383
02:03:03,760 --> 02:03:05,400
- ## While
- ## Honest

1384
02:03:05,520 --> 02:03:07,480
- ## I'm
- ## Truly, I do

1385
02:03:07,680 --> 02:03:09,960
## Turning around and around

1386
02:03:19,360 --> 02:03:21,560
Just a minute!

1387
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
Atchoo!

1388
02:04:59,520 --> 02:05:01,360
Oh, I'm so happy

1389
02:05:01,440 --> 02:05:03,960
I could jump for joy!

1390
02:05:11,320 --> 02:05:13,600
- Come on.
- Come, follow me.

1391
02:05:14,600 --> 02:05:17,400
Children!

1392
02:05:28,200 --> 02:05:29,600
Get me down!

1393
02:05:43,680 --> 02:05:45,400
Call the cavalry!

1394
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:57,640
- Jeremy, Jeremy!
- Jemima!

1395
02:06:00,600 --> 02:06:03,720
- They could be anywhere.
- Look that way. I'll go this way.

1396
02:06:15,600 --> 02:06:19,360
Jeremy and Jemima!
Jeremy and Jemima!

1397
02:06:19,440 --> 02:06:21,200
Jeremy! Jemima!

1398
02:06:21,320 --> 02:06:24,400
It's Truly. We're in here.

1399
02:06:24,480 --> 02:06:27,480
Don't worry.
We'll get you out of here.

1400
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,560
Here. They're in there.

1401
02:06:30,640 --> 02:06:34,880
- Children, are you all right?
- Daddy, get us out of here!

1402
02:06:36,240 --> 02:06:40,000
We found them.
Help me break the door down.

1403
02:06:40,880 --> 02:06:43,200
Children, get away from the door.

1404
02:06:49,520 --> 02:06:52,160
- Children!
- Daddy! Daddy!

1405
02:07:36,800 --> 02:07:38,240
Let me down!

1406
02:07:40,800 --> 02:07:42,760
Ow!

1407
02:07:44,120 --> 02:07:48,320
- Mein Liebchen, are you hurt?
- My back is broken.

1408
02:07:48,400 --> 02:07:52,400
- We must escape through the cellars.
- Well, come on, hurry up.

1409
02:07:52,480 --> 02:07:54,480
Come on.

1410
02:07:56,600 --> 02:07:58,720
- You stay here.
- Daddy, where are you going?

1411
02:08:06,800 --> 02:08:11,240
Where are these children coming from?
We passed a law against children.

1412
02:08:11,360 --> 02:08:15,080
- This way. We'll go down here.
- Where are we going?

1413
02:08:15,160 --> 02:08:19,160
- I'll get my clothes dirty.
- Don't argue.

1414
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,880
Oh, my crown! I lost my crown.

1415
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:33,440
Never mind, my little Bombkin.

1416
02:08:41,360 --> 02:08:43,360
Here.

1417
02:08:44,240 --> 02:08:46,240
Attack!

1418
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,960
- Daddy, look out.
- Look, there's Chitty.

1419
02:08:50,080 --> 02:08:52,160
She's come to save us.

1420
02:09:09,640 --> 02:09:13,800
Hello. What's that car doing here?

1421
02:09:14,320 --> 02:09:17,080
There's Grandpa.

1422
02:09:17,160 --> 02:09:18,960
Caractacus!

1423
02:09:48,920 --> 02:09:52,280
Stand back from the propellers.
Keep clear.

1424
02:10:05,640 --> 02:10:09,360
And so, after that,
Vulgaria became a free country.

1425
02:10:09,440 --> 02:10:14,000
And all the children laughed
and played and they were very happy.

1426
02:10:14,400 --> 02:10:18,720
And Chitty flew high
over the mountains back to England,

1427
02:10:18,800 --> 02:10:20,760
everybody safe and sound and...

1428
02:10:20,880 --> 02:10:25,200
- And Daddy and Truly were married.
- And lived happily ever after.

1429
02:10:25,680 --> 02:10:28,680
Is that how the story ends?

1430
02:10:30,640 --> 02:10:35,000
It's getting late. We'd better get back.

1431
02:11:00,880 --> 02:11:02,240
Well...

1432
02:11:02,360 --> 02:11:04,800
- Goodbye, Jeremy, Jemima.
- Goodbye, Truly.

1433
02:11:04,880 --> 02:11:07,560
- Will we see you again?
- I expect so.

1434
02:11:07,640 --> 02:11:09,640
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1435
02:11:13,360 --> 02:11:15,320
Truly!

1436
02:11:16,680 --> 02:11:19,680
I hope the children didn't embarrass you.

1437
02:11:19,800 --> 02:11:22,920
- In what way?
- That silly joke about us getting married.

1438
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,040
- You know what kids are like.
- I understand.

1439
02:11:25,160 --> 02:11:28,240
I don't think they realise
how ridiculous that would be.

1440
02:11:28,360 --> 02:11:30,240
- Ridiculous?
- Well, yes.

1441
02:11:30,360 --> 02:11:33,480
I mean, you live in that big house,
and your father,

1442
02:11:33,600 --> 02:11:36,600
and the factory and all.
It's a different world.

1443
02:11:36,680 --> 02:11:40,480
If I said something like that,
you'd call me a snob.

1444
02:11:40,600 --> 02:11:43,560
- I didn't mean...
- Goodbye!

1445
02:11:48,160 --> 02:11:51,160
Well, don't you want to ride up front?

1446
02:11:59,880 --> 02:12:03,320
Well, that was a fine picnic, wasn't it?

1447
02:12:06,440 --> 02:12:09,720
- Shall we have another one tomorrow?
- With Truly?

1448
02:12:09,800 --> 02:12:14,800
Well, Miss Scrumptious has a lot
of social engagements, you know.

1449
02:12:16,440 --> 02:12:19,440
Are we ever going to see Truly again?

1450
02:12:21,080 --> 02:12:23,640
Well, we'll see.

1451
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,600
That's Lord Scrumptious's car.

1452
02:12:32,680 --> 02:12:35,560
- Why, I believe it is.
- I wonder what it's doing here.

1453
02:12:35,640 --> 02:12:38,320
- I don't know.
- Come on.

1454
02:12:40,080 --> 02:12:43,080
- Excuse me? Are you...?
- Good afternoon.

1455
02:12:49,440 --> 02:12:51,360
That's wiped out your cavalry.

1456
02:12:51,440 --> 02:12:55,240
But I have my second infantry
battalion attacking from the rear.

1457
02:12:55,360 --> 02:12:57,960
Attacking from the rear?
That's dashed unethical.

1458
02:12:58,080 --> 02:13:01,600
Artillery, prepare to open fire.

1459
02:13:02,200 --> 02:13:04,520
Number one battalion,
prepare to advance.

1460
02:13:04,640 --> 02:13:08,680
- What's going on?
- I've been waiting for you, young Potts.

1461
02:13:08,800 --> 02:13:12,560
- And that wiped out your artillery.
- You're a cad, Potts.

1462
02:13:12,640 --> 02:13:17,600
- What is going on here?
- Fancy you being old Bungie's son.

1463
02:13:17,680 --> 02:13:20,880
- Best batman I ever had.
- Thank you, sir.

1464
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:25,480
My boy, allow me to introduce
to you my brigadier.

1465
02:13:25,600 --> 02:13:29,040
- Potts, how about some more tea?
- Right away, sir.

1466
02:13:29,160 --> 02:13:32,080
As for you, there's a good chance
you may be very rich.

1467
02:13:32,160 --> 02:13:33,880
What do you mean?

1468
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:38,680
Those confounded sweets of yours.
Useless for humans, wonderful for dogs.

1469
02:13:38,800 --> 02:13:41,120
Woof Sweets, that's what we'll call 'em.

1470
02:13:41,200 --> 02:13:45,040
Canine candies.
Dogs love 'em. Make a fortune.

1471
02:13:45,160 --> 02:13:47,280
- You've done it, Daddy.
- Have I?

1472
02:13:47,360 --> 02:13:49,520
It's the posh life for us all now.

1473
02:13:49,640 --> 02:13:51,600
We're going to be rich.

1474
02:13:51,680 --> 02:13:54,320
I invented something
that actually works?

1475
02:13:54,400 --> 02:13:57,720
I wouldn't be offering you
a contract otherwise.

1476
02:13:59,320 --> 02:14:01,440
Later. Don't go away.

1477
02:14:01,560 --> 02:14:04,520
- What about the contract?
- Where are you going?

1478
02:14:04,920 --> 02:14:06,920
Daddy!

1479
02:14:10,400 --> 02:14:12,480
What's the matter with the fella?

1480
02:14:12,600 --> 02:14:16,040
He's a bit of an eccentric, sir.
A genius, of course.

1481
02:14:16,160 --> 02:14:19,880
But definitely an eccentric.

1482
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,800
Can't imagine where he gets it from.

1483
02:14:26,760 --> 02:14:33,200
Truly, you'll never believe it. I got home
and your father was at my house.

1484
02:14:33,360 --> 02:14:36,960
- I know. They told me at the house.
- We're rich.

1485
02:14:37,080 --> 02:14:39,920
More than that, I have succeeded.

1486
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,840
I always knew you would.

1487
02:14:42,920 --> 02:14:48,280
You know something else? There's
nothing ridiculous about getting married.

1488
02:14:48,360 --> 02:14:51,040
Whoever said there was?

1489
02:14:58,400 --> 02:15:00,280
Well, Mr Potts.

1490
02:15:00,360 --> 02:15:04,360
- What's the matter?
- Now you'll have to marry me.

1491
02:15:08,440 --> 02:15:13,040
- So dreams can come true.
- Yes, they can.

1492
02:15:13,160 --> 02:15:15,480
But you have to be practical too.

1493
02:15:15,600 --> 02:15:18,160
You have to face the facts.

1494
02:15:18,240 --> 02:15:20,640
A man has to see things
as they really are.

1495
02:15:20,760 --> 02:15:25,880
A man with responsibilities can't have
his head in the clouds all the time.

1496
02:15:25,920 --> 02:15:28,960
A man should keep his feet
solidly on the ground.

1497
02:15:29,080 --> 02:15:35,280
Oh, a man should have his dreams, but
he has to put them to some practical use,

1498
02:15:35,360 --> 02:15:39,240
not just sit around
and think about 'em all the time.

1499
02:15:46,400 --> 02:15:48,240
## Oh, you pretty Chitty Bang Bang

1500
02:15:48,360 --> 02:15:50,480
## Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,
we love you

1501
02:15:50,600 --> 02:15:52,320
## And our pretty Chitty Bang Bang

1502
02:15:52,400 --> 02:15:54,480
## Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
loves us, too

1503
02:15:54,600 --> 02:15:58,400
## High, low, anywhere we go,
on Chitty Chitty we depend

1504
02:15:58,480 --> 02:16:00,240
## Bang bang,

1505
02:16:00,360 --> 02:16:02,520

## Bang bang,
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

1507
02:16:04,200 --> 02:16:06,880
## Our fine four-fendered friend

1508
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:11,160
## It's uncategorical

1509
02:16:11,320 --> 02:16:13,200
## A fuel-burning oracle

1510
02:16:13,320 --> 02:16:16,840
## A fantasmagorical machine

1511
02:16:17,360 --> 02:16:19,160
## It's more than spectacular

1512
02:16:19,240 --> 02:16:21,200
## To use the vernacular

1513
02:16:21,320 --> 02:16:23,280
- ## It's wizard!
- ## It's smashing!

1514
02:16:23,360 --> 02:16:26,760
## It's keen

1515
02:16:27,360 --> 02:16:29,320
## Oh, Chitty, you Chitty,
pretty Chitty Bang Bang

1516
02:16:29,400 --> 02:16:31,320
## Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,
we love you

1517
02:16:31,400 --> 02:16:33,200
## And, Chitty, in Chitty,
pretty Chitty Bang Bang

1518
02:16:33,320 --> 02:16:35,160
## Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, what we'll do

1519
02:16:35,240 --> 02:16:37,080
## Near Chitty, far Chitty, in our motor car

1520
02:16:37,160 --> 02:16:39,200
## Oh, what a happy time we'll spend

1521
02:16:39,320 --> 02:16:41,040
## Bang bang,
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

1522
02:16:41,160 --> 02:16:43,240
## Our fine four-fendered friend

1523
02:16:43,360 --> 02:16:45,040
## Bang bang,
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

1524
02:16:45,160 --> 02:16:47,360
## Our fine four-fendered friend

1525
02:16:47,440 --> 02:16:49,320
## Chitty Bang Bang,
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

1526
02:16:49,400 --> 02:16:51,000
## Fine four-fendered Chitty Chitty friend!
