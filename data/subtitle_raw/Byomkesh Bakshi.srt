1
00:01:43,717 --> 00:01:45,852
Let me go, sir.
I am getting late.

2
00:01:46,227 --> 00:01:48,838
How do I know which
book he needs?

3
00:01:49,261 --> 00:01:52,928
He had asked me to get 2 sets of
books. Just pay me for it. - Again!

4
00:01:53,216 --> 00:01:54,851
Then let me leave for the day.

5
00:01:55,179 --> 00:01:56,425
I will call later.

6
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:57,981
Byomkesh has gone for some work.

7
00:01:58,006 --> 00:01:59,431
He'll be here soon.
Please wait for some time.

8
00:01:59,455 --> 00:02:01,130
Sir, please listen to me.

9
00:02:01,322 --> 00:02:02,362
Will you keep quiet.

10
00:02:02,594 --> 00:02:04,143
I have not added sugar in tea.
Do I add?

11
00:02:04,167 --> 00:02:06,516
No, no. Thanks.

12
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,329
Actually,

13
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,266
I have to look for
a house for Shondu.

14
00:02:12,436 --> 00:02:14,156
Let me go sir. I have been
waiting here since morning.

15
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,820
It's just a matter
of 400 rupees.

16
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,596
Byomkesh is never late.

17
00:02:17,943 --> 00:02:20,743
He has gone for some work but he had
informed me that you will be here.

18
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:23,961
I have read your articles.

19
00:02:25,237 --> 00:02:28,443
I know you both are
very good friends.

20
00:02:29,321 --> 00:02:31,400
No use hiding it from you.

21
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,363
Sir, let me go. I have to
visit some other place too.

22
00:02:34,813 --> 00:02:37,750
What are you doing amongst the
elders. - I won't go without you.

23
00:02:38,388 --> 00:02:40,279
Then I don't need money now.
I will collect it later.

24
00:02:40,304 --> 00:02:42,113
I am leaving.
- You have to wait here.

25
00:02:42,226 --> 00:02:43,666
I don't know which book he will buy.

26
00:02:43,827 --> 00:02:44,827
Sit here quietly.

27
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:46,899
Yes. What were you saying?

28
00:02:47,484 --> 00:02:48,539
Yes.

29
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:52,470
I am from Dhanbad.

30
00:02:53,027 --> 00:02:54,789
I own three mines there.

31
00:02:55,299 --> 00:02:56,410
I have deal in coal.

32
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:59,066
For the past few days,

33
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:02,203
there have been few unwanted
incidences in the mines.

34
00:03:02,747 --> 00:03:03,786
Blast.

35
00:03:04,088 --> 00:03:05,985
Fights with the labour union.

36
00:03:06,893 --> 00:03:08,290
We had to keep the mines

37
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,776
closed for quiet some days.

38
00:03:12,027 --> 00:03:16,066
I think some one intends
to make my business suffer.

39
00:03:17,245 --> 00:03:18,885
Police has already
investigated the case.

40
00:03:19,256 --> 00:03:20,772
I have changed the labours.

41
00:03:21,496 --> 00:03:23,567
But nothing seems to work.

42
00:03:24,651 --> 00:03:26,326
So I thought

43
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,201
if you and Mr Byomkesh

44
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:32,513
could stay at my place for some
days and investigate the case.

45
00:03:33,057 --> 00:03:35,866
Obviously in disguise.

46
00:03:36,201 --> 00:03:38,315
It's completely your call
what disguise you'll take.

47
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,043
So you are here.

48
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,200
Yes.

49
00:03:40,648 --> 00:03:41,695
Show me this one.

50
00:03:42,204 --> 00:03:43,490
Hurry up.

51
00:03:43,907 --> 00:03:44,931
Open it.

52
00:03:50,511 --> 00:03:52,075
Take this. Now leave.

53
00:03:52,593 --> 00:03:53,656
Quick.

54
00:03:54,983 --> 00:03:56,141
So you are here.

55
00:03:56,747 --> 00:03:59,358
Sorry I am late.

56
00:04:00,664 --> 00:04:02,100
I had an urgent work.

57
00:04:02,349 --> 00:04:03,627
That is the reason I am delayed.

58
00:04:03,651 --> 00:04:06,516
Your train is at 8 pm.

59
00:04:06,678 --> 00:04:07,789
Still time for it.

60
00:04:08,307 --> 00:04:11,211
I read your letter.

61
00:04:11,715 --> 00:04:12,811
So.

62
00:04:13,764 --> 00:04:15,558
What I understand from it,

63
00:04:16,044 --> 00:04:17,353
we have to leave on Saturday.

64
00:04:17,736 --> 00:04:19,006
Ajit, have you offered tea?

65
00:04:19,183 --> 00:04:20,183
Yes.

66
00:04:20,317 --> 00:04:23,214
Actually, tomorrow
and day after tomorrow

67
00:04:23,743 --> 00:04:26,291
I have to take care
of few pending cases.

68
00:04:26,721 --> 00:04:28,682
So. It has to be.

69
00:04:28,858 --> 00:04:32,707
But I would like to know
the details of the case.

70
00:04:34,214 --> 00:04:35,460
Bring me tea.

71
00:06:14,446 --> 00:06:16,525
'Towards the end of 60's'

72
00:06:17,178 --> 00:06:18,234
'During summers.'

73
00:06:19,124 --> 00:06:22,291
'After resolving the
secrets of Beni Shongha.'

74
00:06:22,739 --> 00:06:24,953
'I and Byomkesh reached'

75
00:06:25,256 --> 00:06:27,447
'at Bangla Bihar border.'

76
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:31,349
'There were many coal'

77
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,399
'mines in this city.'

78
00:06:34,425 --> 00:06:36,345
'Rich businessmen came
and settled here.'

79
00:06:36,739 --> 00:06:39,556
'Apart from property and wealth'

80
00:06:39,906 --> 00:06:41,208
'they had immense money.'

81
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:43,313
'The money that was'

82
00:06:43,607 --> 00:06:44,932
'mostly'

83
00:06:45,427 --> 00:06:46,934
'black in colour like the coal.'

84
00:06:48,638 --> 00:06:50,146
'It's very common to have trouble'

85
00:06:50,426 --> 00:06:53,513
'where there is lot
of money involved.'

86
00:06:54,446 --> 00:06:57,827
'At Mr Munish's coal mine,
many accidents kept happening.'

87
00:06:58,123 --> 00:07:01,211
'Someone or some people instigated'

88
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:02,869
'fights among the labor union'

89
00:07:03,075 --> 00:07:05,410
'and wants to make
his business suffer.'

90
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:09,168
'Byomkesh will have to
investigate in disguise.

91
00:07:09,511 --> 00:07:11,725
'and figure out who
are the culprlt's.'

92
00:07:11,989 --> 00:07:14,528
'So we arrive with fake names.'

93
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:18,168
'I am Sujit and Byomkesh is Gagan.'

94
00:07:18,512 --> 00:07:20,560
'Initially it was decided'

95
00:07:20,951 --> 00:07:22,975
'that we both will be in disguise.'

96
00:07:23,461 --> 00:07:24,707
'But Byomkesh, the one who'

97
00:07:25,297 --> 00:07:27,558
'is an expert in disguise.'

98
00:07:27,878 --> 00:07:29,783
'I wonder why he didn't'

99
00:07:30,334 --> 00:07:31,494
'take a disguise at the end.'

100
00:07:31,588 --> 00:07:34,501
You'll rest today.

101
00:07:35,236 --> 00:07:38,696
Tomorrow you can visit
my office and mines.

102
00:07:39,558 --> 00:07:40,947
Office is close to my house.

103
00:07:41,264 --> 00:07:42,571
Why do we wait till tomorrow?

104
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:44,555
Can't we go today?

105
00:07:46,144 --> 00:07:49,375
Then I will inform my
Manager Mr Suroboti.

106
00:07:50,029 --> 00:07:52,349
He will take you'll there.
- Do you want to say something?

107
00:07:53,205 --> 00:07:54,205
What?

108
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,282
I mean, Dad.

109
00:07:58,521 --> 00:07:59,902
Come inside.

110
00:08:03,106 --> 00:08:04,323
Let me introduce you'll.

111
00:08:05,969 --> 00:08:07,342
He is Punish.

112
00:08:07,715 --> 00:08:09,596
My only son.

113
00:08:10,393 --> 00:08:13,409
And these are my friends.
They have come from Kolkatta.

114
00:08:13,665 --> 00:08:15,229
In regards to mining business.

115
00:08:15,913 --> 00:08:17,270
He is Gagan.

116
00:08:17,495 --> 00:08:18,502
And he is

117
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:21,050
his partner. Sujit Bondhopadyay.

118
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:26,464
No. I mean, Indira was asking that

119
00:08:26,996 --> 00:08:29,798
will they need two rooms or...
- Indira.

120
00:08:31,367 --> 00:08:32,605
She is Punish's wife.

121
00:08:33,505 --> 00:08:36,870
She is the only lady in this house.

122
00:08:38,096 --> 00:08:41,866
After the death of my wife, she has
taken up all the responsibilities.

123
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:44,776
I think, one room

124
00:08:45,182 --> 00:08:46,524
will be sufficient.

125
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:49,398
Yes. Just a matter of a few day.

126
00:08:50,124 --> 00:08:51,148
Okay.

127
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:58,046
Do you doubt him?

128
00:09:00,637 --> 00:09:03,558
No one is a friend in
our business Mr Byomkesh.

129
00:09:04,003 --> 00:09:05,259
We deal in money.

130
00:09:05,498 --> 00:09:06,514
Punish.

131
00:09:12,501 --> 00:09:14,120
I am your client.

132
00:09:15,439 --> 00:09:18,487
You are here to help me.

133
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:22,589
I should not be hiding
anything from you.

134
00:09:23,178 --> 00:09:24,618
That is why I will tell you frankly.

135
00:09:24,926 --> 00:09:27,838
My son is not interested
in my business.

136
00:09:28,898 --> 00:09:31,112
Since his childhood,
he has been educated

137
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:33,295
int the biggest possible
schools and colleges.

138
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:38,951
He didn't had to work
hard to earn money.

139
00:09:42,937 --> 00:09:43,985
To ensure that

140
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,272
he doesn't gets into wrong company,

141
00:09:46,391 --> 00:09:49,336
I forcibly got him married.

142
00:09:50,628 --> 00:09:51,636
Yes.

143
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:54,685
Punish might have
many weaknesses but

144
00:09:55,992 --> 00:09:58,072
he will make his
dad's business suffer.

145
00:10:00,004 --> 00:10:02,108
He has still not
dared to that extent.

146
00:10:03,516 --> 00:10:04,579
He is interested in

147
00:10:05,081 --> 00:10:06,899
going to clubs and

148
00:10:07,878 --> 00:10:09,458
enjoying with friends.

149
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:16,868
Apart from that, I don't

150
00:10:18,428 --> 00:10:21,039
think he is capable of

151
00:10:23,305 --> 00:10:25,368
conspiring against anyone.

152
00:10:27,786 --> 00:10:29,595
Is there anyone

153
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,343
who had offered to buy your mines?

154
00:10:33,155 --> 00:10:34,250
No.

155
00:10:34,506 --> 00:10:36,117
Sir. Govind sir.

156
00:10:36,276 --> 00:10:38,062
Move.

157
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,233
Munish.

158
00:10:40,615 --> 00:10:42,917
What are they doing? Tell them.

159
00:10:43,396 --> 00:10:45,155
If they can't differentiate
between an enemy

160
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,820
and friends, dacoit's
will get in easily.

161
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:48,690
I had to park my car
at the gate and enter.

162
00:10:49,323 --> 00:10:51,255
Actually...
- I came here as I heard about

163
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,077
the incidences
happening at your mines.

164
00:10:53,526 --> 00:10:56,089
Your security guard started
questioning at the gate.

165
00:10:56,527 --> 00:10:57,887
As if I am entering the Taj Mahal.

166
00:10:58,061 --> 00:10:59,648
I am sorry Govindo.

167
00:11:00,144 --> 00:11:02,597
Actually... - Actually the
matter is extremely simple.

168
00:11:03,878 --> 00:11:05,624
Our city is full of thieves.

169
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,753
And managers are all useless.

170
00:11:08,345 --> 00:11:09,972
We have just employed wrong people.

171
00:11:10,426 --> 00:11:12,029
Just few days back,
there were few

172
00:11:12,054 --> 00:11:13,839
unexpected incidences
at my mines too.

173
00:11:14,165 --> 00:11:15,911
I was saving for worker's union.

174
00:11:16,185 --> 00:11:18,987
Everything has been ruined since
the government

175
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:21,163
encouraged the unions for
increasing their vote bank.

176
00:11:21,731 --> 00:11:24,049
Relax Govindo.

177
00:11:24,933 --> 00:11:26,092
What will you have?

178
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:28,030
Beer or tea?

179
00:11:28,332 --> 00:11:30,475
Tea will be fine. Are
you facing many problems?

180
00:11:30,619 --> 00:11:32,024
Leave it.

181
00:11:32,454 --> 00:11:34,478
Let me introduce you.

182
00:11:34,718 --> 00:11:36,749
He is Mr Gagan Chakravarthy.

183
00:11:37,302 --> 00:11:40,112
And he is Mr Sujit
Bandopadhyay, my friend.

184
00:11:40,982 --> 00:11:42,633
I met him at Kolkatta.

185
00:11:42,841 --> 00:11:45,031
He is here...
- He is the owner of our company.

186
00:11:45,516 --> 00:11:48,676
He wants to invest in coal.

187
00:11:48,918 --> 00:11:51,156
We are here to inquire about it.

188
00:11:51,395 --> 00:11:53,752
And he is Mr Govindo Haldar.

189
00:11:54,757 --> 00:11:56,384
He owns three mines.

190
00:11:56,607 --> 00:11:57,718
Less sugar.

191
00:11:58,339 --> 00:11:59,362
Milk?

192
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:02,098
What company?

193
00:12:03,214 --> 00:12:04,253
Milk.

194
00:12:04,961 --> 00:12:06,223
Soap, oil.

195
00:12:06,423 --> 00:12:08,272
Bio-scope. Made few.

196
00:12:08,709 --> 00:12:09,765
Now coal.

197
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:11,845
What Bio-scope has he done?

198
00:12:14,027 --> 00:12:15,234
Everything failed.

199
00:12:16,099 --> 00:12:17,980
So now we want to invest in coal.

200
00:12:18,403 --> 00:12:20,744
A business that will
never suffer loss.

201
00:12:20,992 --> 00:12:22,953
Also the investment will
be comparatively less.

202
00:12:23,184 --> 00:12:25,501
So he thinks coal will be the best.

203
00:12:28,308 --> 00:12:29,729
What do you think about it so far?

204
00:12:31,637 --> 00:12:35,328
As of now, I am confused.

205
00:12:35,514 --> 00:12:36,673
You will understand it.

206
00:12:37,024 --> 00:12:39,184
You will understand everything
the next couple of days.

207
00:12:39,234 --> 00:12:42,655
Because like Bio-scope, just
spending money will not bear fruit.

208
00:12:44,176 --> 00:12:45,255
It's complicated.

209
00:12:45,749 --> 00:12:48,051
Too complicated. Look at my mines.

210
00:12:48,648 --> 00:12:50,513
Suddenly labour
union started raising

211
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:52,209
issues related to
underground safety.

212
00:12:52,739 --> 00:12:54,294
Safety measures, etc.

213
00:12:54,798 --> 00:12:56,075
Have to buy insurance.

214
00:12:56,743 --> 00:12:57,879
They are provoking me.

215
00:12:58,119 --> 00:12:59,618
Threatening the manager.
I know

216
00:12:59,643 --> 00:13:00,943
it's no use complaining
to the police.

217
00:13:01,767 --> 00:13:04,068
No use getting a
detective from Kolkatta.

218
00:13:04,936 --> 00:13:08,175
I implanted my men
amongst them as spy.

219
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:11,805
There were three who caused trouble,
whom I fired. End of the story.

220
00:13:12,228 --> 00:13:14,908
What did you understand? - No use
hiring a detective from Kolkatta.

221
00:13:15,056 --> 00:13:16,674
Is it?
- Yes.

222
00:13:17,408 --> 00:13:19,995
Munish, you have to
trust your friends.

223
00:13:21,407 --> 00:13:23,248
You didn't inform me
about all these problem?

224
00:13:23,496 --> 00:13:25,750
Just give me a call and
I will be here for you.

225
00:13:26,324 --> 00:13:27,459
Mr Munish.

226
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:29,635
Your son wants to say something.

227
00:13:32,053 --> 00:13:33,164
I was saying,

228
00:13:33,586 --> 00:13:35,435
that your rooms are
ready on the 2nd floor.

229
00:13:36,167 --> 00:13:37,183
The lunch is also ready.

230
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:39,478
You'll can...
- Let's go then.

231
00:13:40,003 --> 00:13:41,209
We will see you later.

232
00:13:42,134 --> 00:13:43,452
I told them

233
00:13:43,747 --> 00:13:47,866
to stay at my house
instead of a hotel.

234
00:13:48,538 --> 00:13:50,950
I want to visit your mines.

235
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:55,756
Sir it depend on
how low you can get.

236
00:13:56,498 --> 00:13:58,950
My mines are not as

237
00:13:59,653 --> 00:14:01,930
secure as Munish's mines.

238
00:14:03,877 --> 00:14:06,274
We are use to such conditions.

239
00:14:08,034 --> 00:14:09,066
Let's go Sujit.

240
00:14:16,997 --> 00:14:17,997
Wow!

241
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,092
Amazing arrangements.

242
00:14:23,297 --> 00:14:25,900
Do I send you food in your room?
- Yes please.

243
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,162
Okay.

244
00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:44,124
I am informing Mr Suroboti

245
00:14:44,731 --> 00:14:46,291
that you'll will be
visiting the mines.

246
00:14:46,883 --> 00:14:48,597
Have lunch and rest.

247
00:14:49,823 --> 00:14:51,736
I think 4 in the
evening will be fine.

248
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:53,698
Oh Yes.

249
00:14:59,756 --> 00:15:01,860
Govindo Haldar is
a very cunning man.

250
00:15:02,218 --> 00:15:03,472
Give me a cigarette.

251
00:15:04,809 --> 00:15:06,912
He understood that we are
not here to buy coal mines.

252
00:15:08,455 --> 00:15:10,518
As per you who else has understood?

253
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:12,458
Punish.

254
00:15:13,231 --> 00:15:14,485
Can I come in?

255
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,740
Yes.

256
00:15:16,805 --> 00:15:17,876
I mean.

257
00:15:18,242 --> 00:15:19,853
If you don't mind,

258
00:15:20,157 --> 00:15:21,585
I need to talk to you.

259
00:15:21,865 --> 00:15:22,872
Tell me.

260
00:15:29,049 --> 00:15:31,168
I am in trouble Mr Byomkesh.

261
00:15:31,901 --> 00:15:32,948
Trouble?

262
00:15:33,202 --> 00:15:34,202
What is it?

263
00:15:34,696 --> 00:15:37,474
I have read all your books Mr Ajit.

264
00:15:37,962 --> 00:15:39,105
Dad, I mean.

265
00:15:39,415 --> 00:15:42,002
When my father-in-law
asked for your book.

266
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:44,115
I guessed it right then.

267
00:15:44,603 --> 00:15:47,270
He doesn't read detective novels.

268
00:15:47,631 --> 00:15:50,385
And I had seen your
photo in the newspaper.

269
00:15:50,751 --> 00:15:52,712
It was published after Agniban case.

270
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,253
Tell me what you want to say.

271
00:15:55,196 --> 00:15:58,228
I don't know why my father
in law has brought you here.

272
00:15:58,906 --> 00:16:02,605
But when you are here,
I want a help from you.

273
00:16:03,427 --> 00:16:06,610
I don't know about your fees too.

274
00:16:07,946 --> 00:16:10,200
But this is real gold.

275
00:16:10,925 --> 00:16:12,838
It's price won't be less.

276
00:16:16,838 --> 00:16:18,567
Let me first hear
what is the problem.

277
00:16:20,626 --> 00:16:23,722
My husband has got
involved in some terrible activity.

278
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:27,527
I think he has committed a crime
and want to know the truth.

279
00:16:28,411 --> 00:16:29,427
What crime?

280
00:16:30,548 --> 00:16:32,985
Few days back a business
man got murdered.

281
00:16:33,494 --> 00:16:34,979
His name was Pranhori Poddar.

282
00:16:35,777 --> 00:16:36,928
He.

283
00:16:37,405 --> 00:16:41,682
I think he is involved
in his murder.

284
00:16:42,004 --> 00:16:45,577
He use to visit Pranhori
house very frequently.

285
00:16:45,778 --> 00:16:48,087
He returned home very late
on the day he was murdered.

286
00:16:49,004 --> 00:16:51,448
Since then he looks scared.

287
00:16:52,658 --> 00:16:54,237
Dad knows nothing about this.

288
00:16:55,313 --> 00:16:58,163
And we have frequent
fights over this issue.

289
00:16:58,697 --> 00:16:59,983
Did you go to the police?

290
00:17:00,373 --> 00:17:01,373
No.

291
00:17:01,717 --> 00:17:03,716
But if this issue
is not resolved,

292
00:17:03,741 --> 00:17:05,586
our relation will be
completely ruined.

293
00:17:05,943 --> 00:17:07,666
We can't tell anything
to dad about this.

294
00:17:08,082 --> 00:17:11,749
And it will be good if you don't
tell Punish that I told you.

295
00:17:12,682 --> 00:17:16,087
I am asking for your help
as I am in a big trouble.

296
00:17:17,749 --> 00:17:19,217
Who is Pranhori?

297
00:17:20,093 --> 00:17:21,093
They

298
00:17:21,618 --> 00:17:23,468
use to go to his home as a big gang.

299
00:17:23,707 --> 00:17:26,862
Punish has a group.

300
00:17:27,068 --> 00:17:28,624
Every one is a member
of the coal club.

301
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:29,878
Coal club?

302
00:17:30,485 --> 00:17:33,199
Yes. The club is for
all wealthy people here.

303
00:17:33,838 --> 00:17:35,981
Females don't go there often.

304
00:17:36,229 --> 00:17:38,753
But the boys go to play
card, tennis, billiard.

305
00:17:41,312 --> 00:17:43,011
Why did he go to Pranhori house?

306
00:17:44,691 --> 00:17:45,810
To gamble.

307
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,415
Few days back, he tried to get
money by mortgaging my jeweleries.

308
00:17:49,663 --> 00:17:51,171
That is when I got suspicious.

309
00:17:51,482 --> 00:17:52,491
Then?

310
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,446
He is a man.

311
00:17:56,004 --> 00:17:58,393
I can accept if he gambles.

312
00:17:59,032 --> 00:18:00,715
But if he is a murderer.

313
00:18:00,873 --> 00:18:04,096
If he involved with the murder
then I will get separated.

314
00:18:04,638 --> 00:18:07,027
I can't live with a murderer.

315
00:18:07,578 --> 00:18:08,675
Keep it.

316
00:18:09,399 --> 00:18:11,226
I give my word, I will help you.

317
00:18:11,855 --> 00:18:13,797
If your husband is not involved

318
00:18:13,822 --> 00:18:15,664
then I won't let
anything happen to him.

319
00:18:16,049 --> 00:18:18,390
I don't come from a rich family.

320
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:21,672
I have a self respect.

321
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:24,365
You

322
00:18:24,748 --> 00:18:26,010
please keep this.

323
00:18:30,724 --> 00:18:31,978
My fees

324
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:33,694
is not so high.

325
00:18:34,593 --> 00:18:35,616
Take it.

326
00:18:36,506 --> 00:18:37,641
Keep this.

327
00:18:38,589 --> 00:18:40,796
Let I finish the
investigation, then.

328
00:18:48,555 --> 00:18:51,825
Let's have our lunch.
- Yes.

329
00:18:53,462 --> 00:18:54,970
We are very hungry.

330
00:18:56,529 --> 00:18:58,132
Can you please arrange for lunch?

331
00:19:00,635 --> 00:19:02,429
Yes, sure.

332
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:06,251
Welcome Mr Gagan.

333
00:19:06,515 --> 00:19:09,190
I was waiting for you. You'll
want to visit the mines.

334
00:19:09,702 --> 00:19:13,488
Yes. - No problem. He is
Bishu, my maternal cousin.

335
00:19:13,744 --> 00:19:15,411
He is a very good boy.

336
00:19:15,658 --> 00:19:17,499
He will guide you around.

337
00:19:17,853 --> 00:19:20,234
So Let's go.

338
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:26,283
At 4 in the evening,

339
00:19:26,601 --> 00:19:28,124
Mr Suroboti took us

340
00:19:28,452 --> 00:19:30,372
to visit the coal mines.

341
00:19:41,603 --> 00:19:42,833
Stop.

342
00:19:50,554 --> 00:19:51,555
Come.

343
00:19:52,739 --> 00:19:53,921
We have to walk a little.

344
00:19:54,113 --> 00:19:55,279
The mine is close by.

345
00:19:55,981 --> 00:19:58,148
Since how long have
you been working here?

346
00:19:58,715 --> 00:20:00,914
Approximately 20 years.

347
00:20:01,215 --> 00:20:03,207
At least 20 years.

348
00:20:03,471 --> 00:20:04,884
Wow! 20 years.

349
00:20:05,499 --> 00:20:06,962
What did you do before that?

350
00:20:06,987 --> 00:20:08,907
Before that, I worked as
an accountant at Odisha.

351
00:20:09,051 --> 00:20:11,043
Do you have too much
labour problem here?

352
00:20:11,513 --> 00:20:14,584
Where don't you have labour problem?

353
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:16,906
Bishu.

354
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,845
Listen, quickly go and inform them.

355
00:20:22,977 --> 00:20:24,668
Labour problem is very

356
00:20:24,843 --> 00:20:27,525
common at big mines.

357
00:20:27,861 --> 00:20:29,234
But I must say one thing.

358
00:20:30,182 --> 00:20:32,389
If you can partner

359
00:20:32,695 --> 00:20:35,155
in big coal mines,

360
00:20:35,715 --> 00:20:37,167
you can earn great profit’s.

361
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:39,137
Okay.

362
00:20:39,797 --> 00:20:41,146
Do you stay here alone?

363
00:20:41,465 --> 00:20:42,957
Yes.

364
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:45,113
You have not married?
- I have.

365
00:20:45,468 --> 00:20:47,770
My family lives at Cuttack.

366
00:20:48,226 --> 00:20:49,702
Cuttack?
- Yes.

367
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:51,738
Since last 20 years?
- Yes.

368
00:20:52,444 --> 00:20:55,008
No. Then...

369
00:20:56,203 --> 00:20:57,608
Sorry...

370
00:20:57,967 --> 00:21:00,808
Living with the Biharis, Hindi is...

371
00:21:00,976 --> 00:21:03,738
Actually my first wife

372
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:05,766
died few years back.

373
00:21:06,347 --> 00:21:08,373
I remarried three years back.

374
00:21:08,502 --> 00:21:09,902
So you didn't bring her here?
- No.

375
00:21:10,305 --> 00:21:12,242
She is allergic to coal.

376
00:21:12,607 --> 00:21:14,131
You want to visit the mines.

377
00:21:15,239 --> 00:21:17,254
Is is needed to go down to
understand the business?

378
00:21:18,989 --> 00:21:22,481
Absolutely. You have understood
the business very well.

379
00:21:23,152 --> 00:21:24,334
How did I understand?

380
00:21:24,582 --> 00:21:27,566
I too have never been down
for the last 20 years.

381
00:21:28,943 --> 00:21:31,166
I think we need to look

382
00:21:31,674 --> 00:21:33,189
for a mine that is on sale.

383
00:21:33,522 --> 00:21:34,887
Govindo Haldar.

384
00:21:35,992 --> 00:21:38,508
Govind Haldar. Don't you know him?

385
00:21:40,116 --> 00:21:41,338
Bishu.

386
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,595
Byomkesh suddenly decides
to visit the police station.

387
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:47,152
Mr Suroboti, drops us
at the police station.

388
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:50,172
We know the OC of the police
station Mr Promod Borate

389
00:21:50,554 --> 00:21:53,777
since the match stick case.

390
00:21:55,384 --> 00:21:58,448
Mr Gagan please raise
the window glass.

391
00:21:58,672 --> 00:22:00,394
It's very dusty outside.

392
00:22:06,405 --> 00:22:08,125
We will be reaching the
police station soon.

393
00:22:08,153 --> 00:22:09,907
I will do one thing.

394
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,208
I will drop you'll at
the police station as

395
00:22:13,576 --> 00:22:15,989
I have to go somewhere.

396
00:22:16,928 --> 00:22:19,079
You'll will get a
cab while returning.

397
00:22:19,702 --> 00:22:21,948
This is the taxi stand.

398
00:22:22,212 --> 00:22:23,585
Here it goes.

399
00:22:24,031 --> 00:22:26,357
You will get cabs from here.
No problem.

400
00:22:27,704 --> 00:22:29,768
After dropping sir, we will

401
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:32,095
go to the mine.

402
00:22:32,216 --> 00:22:33,478
Send them in.
- Yes sir.

403
00:22:33,948 --> 00:22:35,003
Go in.

404
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:38,260
Welcome.

405
00:22:38,413 --> 00:22:40,153
When did you become Mr Gagan?

406
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:42,717
Even Pandav's had
to take a disguise.

407
00:22:43,308 --> 00:22:44,920
Please come Mr Ajit, have a seat.

408
00:22:45,408 --> 00:22:47,924
Will you'll have tea?
- Yes.

409
00:22:48,801 --> 00:22:51,007
Ramdin, get three cups of tea.

410
00:22:51,891 --> 00:22:53,312
I came here for an important work.

411
00:22:54,124 --> 00:22:56,981
Few days back someone named
Pranhori Poddar was murdered.

412
00:22:57,094 --> 00:22:59,721
Are you here for Pranhori case?
- No.

413
00:23:00,251 --> 00:23:01,695
I am here for Phurjhudi Mine case.

414
00:23:01,983 --> 00:23:03,768
Munish Chakravarthy has
asked me to come here.

415
00:23:03,792 --> 00:23:04,991
Oh yes.

416
00:23:05,565 --> 00:23:07,620
That case file is still with me.

417
00:23:07,903 --> 00:23:10,466
The labour union was shot.
He is still alive.

418
00:23:11,413 --> 00:23:12,802
But we couldn't do anything.

419
00:23:13,662 --> 00:23:15,567
Police cannot take
care of these cases.

420
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,008
Mr Munish has taken
a correct decision.

421
00:23:19,838 --> 00:23:23,631
Then regarding Pranhori murder?
- Yes.

422
00:23:24,055 --> 00:23:26,570
His son is on your suspect list.

423
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:28,102
What do I say?

424
00:23:29,313 --> 00:23:30,821
I am in deep trouble.

425
00:23:31,935 --> 00:23:36,046
The 4 suspects are important
people of this city.

426
00:23:36,358 --> 00:23:37,715
Big mess.

427
00:23:39,021 --> 00:23:41,021
So we have to proceed
very carefully.

428
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,232
There is no witness. We just
have circumstantial evidence.

429
00:23:47,522 --> 00:23:50,118
If I arrest even a single
person incorrectly then

430
00:23:51,003 --> 00:23:52,392
I will lose my job.

431
00:23:55,946 --> 00:23:58,041
Can you tell us about the
case from the beginning?

432
00:23:59,378 --> 00:24:02,179
Arbindo Haldar's elder
brother owns coal mines.

433
00:24:03,564 --> 00:24:06,810
Mrigan Mallik's father
is a contractor.

434
00:24:07,718 --> 00:24:11,647
Modhumoy Ghosh is a lawyer.
He has immense property.

435
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:15,352
And your clients son,
Punish Chakravarthy.

436
00:24:15,918 --> 00:24:18,958
I have their photos in the file.
Do you want to have a look? - Sure.

437
00:24:19,485 --> 00:24:22,866
Is he Mrigan Mallik?
- No, he is Modhumoy the lawyer.

438
00:24:23,925 --> 00:24:25,417
He is Mrigan Mallik.

439
00:24:26,157 --> 00:24:29,030
That means this is Arbindo.
- Most dangerous of them all.

440
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:31,342
There is a club
named The Coal Club

441
00:24:31,367 --> 00:24:32,958
which is frequented
by the rich people.

442
00:24:33,317 --> 00:24:35,452
These four are the
members of this club.

443
00:24:36,504 --> 00:24:39,178
Whatever I got to know,

444
00:24:39,569 --> 00:24:41,649
they were introduced to
Pranhori in this club Itself.

445
00:24:41,841 --> 00:24:44,039
How are you'll?

446
00:24:45,004 --> 00:24:46,925
Do you want to say something?

447
00:24:49,328 --> 00:24:52,130
Are you playing three cards? Flash?

448
00:24:53,109 --> 00:24:54,466
Why are you concerned?

449
00:24:54,712 --> 00:24:56,284
No, I mean...

450
00:24:57,153 --> 00:24:59,145
I don't see money involved here.

451
00:24:59,266 --> 00:25:01,084
Gambling is not
allowed in this club.

452
00:25:01,308 --> 00:25:02,784
Outside the club?

453
00:25:03,143 --> 00:25:04,270
What do you mean?

454
00:25:11,453 --> 00:25:13,453
I am Pranhori Poddar.

455
00:25:14,766 --> 00:25:17,957
My contact details are
mentioned in the card.

456
00:25:19,326 --> 00:25:21,468
If you'll wish, you can

457
00:25:21,941 --> 00:25:23,361
come over in the evening.

458
00:25:24,427 --> 00:25:26,244
I have all kind of arrangements.

459
00:25:26,906 --> 00:25:28,676
Drinks too.

460
00:25:40,834 --> 00:25:43,659
It's fun to swim in
the swimming pool.

461
00:25:44,105 --> 00:25:47,684
But isn't the sea more fun?

462
00:25:49,819 --> 00:25:52,343
You'll don't look like small kids.

463
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:55,274
You'll do know how to swim?

464
00:26:06,787 --> 00:26:08,160
Your turn next.

465
00:26:08,607 --> 00:26:11,639
Your glass is empty. Do I fill it?

466
00:26:15,161 --> 00:26:17,685
Smoke later, first play.
It's your turn.

467
00:26:30,872 --> 00:26:33,530
Patience. Do all that later.

468
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:35,614
Mohini.

469
00:26:36,972 --> 00:26:38,718
You have forgotten
about me completely.

470
00:26:42,869 --> 00:26:44,051
Oh no.

471
00:26:45,784 --> 00:26:47,595
Mr Pranhori.

472
00:26:48,055 --> 00:26:51,247
We will play again.
- What? What? Let's move.

473
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:52,835
Wait.

474
00:26:53,075 --> 00:26:55,996
We have just begun.

475
00:26:56,245 --> 00:26:58,007
Play.

476
00:26:58,152 --> 00:27:00,001
Shuffle the cards well.

477
00:27:00,289 --> 00:27:02,392
Pranhori had a beautiful maid.

478
00:27:03,269 --> 00:27:04,396
Her name is Mohini.

479
00:27:05,233 --> 00:27:07,376
The day he was murdered.
At night 11 O'clock

480
00:27:07,934 --> 00:27:09,902
a truck was passing that way.

481
00:27:10,221 --> 00:27:11,924
Mohini stopped that truck
and tells the driver

482
00:27:11,948 --> 00:27:13,607
that her sir has been murdered.

483
00:27:39,905 --> 00:27:41,913
Did anyone come to meet your sir?

484
00:27:42,417 --> 00:27:43,425
No.

485
00:27:43,575 --> 00:27:44,646
Nobody?

486
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:46,916
I don't know. I was
cooking downstairs.

487
00:27:46,941 --> 00:27:48,649
I didn't get to know anything.

488
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:52,933
Who visited him?

489
00:27:58,631 --> 00:28:00,107
Mohini, speak the truth.

490
00:28:01,873 --> 00:28:04,634
You didn't see anyone come, there's
no evidence of anyone coming here.

491
00:28:04,765 --> 00:28:06,836
Here your sir is lying dead.

492
00:28:08,031 --> 00:28:09,555
You are alone in this house.

493
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:13,822
Then you will be my first suspect.

494
00:28:13,917 --> 00:28:15,593
Why will I do it? I informed

495
00:28:15,618 --> 00:28:17,711
the police.
- Yes you can call and inform.

496
00:28:18,795 --> 00:28:20,953
You can steal sir's money.

497
00:28:22,037 --> 00:28:23,346
Tell me who use to come here?

498
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:26,898
4 men frequently came here.

499
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:29,561
To play card.

500
00:28:30,325 --> 00:28:31,492
Who were they?

501
00:28:32,406 --> 00:28:33,795
The rich men from The Coal Club.

502
00:28:33,987 --> 00:28:35,447
To play card?

503
00:28:38,738 --> 00:28:41,405
Why did they come here to play card?
They can play at the club too.

504
00:28:41,581 --> 00:28:45,287
They gambled here. Sir ordered me
to cook for them, serve them drinks.

505
00:28:47,756 --> 00:28:49,335
They didn't come here today?

506
00:28:49,623 --> 00:28:51,083
They came 3 times a week.

507
00:28:51,544 --> 00:28:53,584
Tuesday, Thursday and Saturdays.
Today is Sunday.

508
00:28:55,058 --> 00:28:56,129
Okay.

509
00:28:57,608 --> 00:29:01,219
Till the time this case is resolved,
you will not leave this house.

510
00:29:02,278 --> 00:29:04,158
I will have my security
guard monitor the house.

511
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,859
After questioning
Mohini, I got to know

512
00:29:08,884 --> 00:29:11,102
that the men never
came by their own car.

513
00:29:11,605 --> 00:29:13,573
They came by a private taxi.

514
00:29:14,417 --> 00:29:17,100
There are approximately
100 taxi's in the city.

515
00:29:17,538 --> 00:29:19,316
We found one of them.

516
00:29:19,685 --> 00:29:21,042
He accepted too

517
00:29:21,505 --> 00:29:25,656
that he had gone there
with 4 men that night.

518
00:29:26,417 --> 00:29:29,115
We secretly took him to The Coal
club and identified all the four.

519
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:34,277
Arbindo Haldar, Punish Chakravarthy,
Mrigan Mallik and Modhumoy Ghosh.

520
00:29:35,656 --> 00:29:39,410
But It's not possible to arrest them
based on the taxi drivers words.

521
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:41,421
That is why I am stuck.

522
00:29:42,401 --> 00:29:45,425
On top of it, Arbindo's
elder brother had come here.

523
00:29:47,349 --> 00:29:48,468
Sit.

524
00:29:50,258 --> 00:29:51,639
So Mr Promod.

525
00:29:52,325 --> 00:29:55,682
I heard that the gambler has been
murdered. Fine he is murdered.

526
00:29:56,431 --> 00:29:58,796
So why are you disturbing my
brother repeatedly in the club?

527
00:30:00,824 --> 00:30:03,236
You were transferred
here from Kolkatta.

528
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:06,881
Do you know where you will
be transferred to next?

529
00:30:09,004 --> 00:30:10,790
I feel bad to talk to you like this.

530
00:30:12,391 --> 00:30:13,955
Come home someday.

531
00:30:14,497 --> 00:30:16,013
Enjoy a hearty meal.

532
00:30:17,221 --> 00:30:18,499
Let's sit and chit chat.

533
00:30:19,755 --> 00:30:21,557
We need to see the
post postmortem report.

534
00:30:21,922 --> 00:30:23,666
Yes. I will show you
the report

535
00:30:23,691 --> 00:30:25,263
and introduce you to
the doctor as well.

536
00:30:25,849 --> 00:30:28,055
Oh Yes, do I drop you by my car?

537
00:30:28,462 --> 00:30:30,414
You'll are staying
at Mr Munish's house.

538
00:30:30,598 --> 00:30:32,765
It will be good if you can drop us.
- Come.

539
00:30:34,602 --> 00:30:35,674
Did you see?

540
00:30:35,905 --> 00:30:36,976
Bishwanath.

541
00:30:42,041 --> 00:30:43,248
Did you ask for me?

542
00:30:44,162 --> 00:30:45,162
Yes.

543
00:30:49,605 --> 00:30:50,812
Tell me.

544
00:30:51,518 --> 00:30:54,145
How are you related
to Pranhori Poddar?

545
00:30:54,673 --> 00:30:56,193
Where were you on the
night he was murdered.

546
00:30:56,217 --> 00:30:57,697
Please give us the details.

547
00:30:58,209 --> 00:31:02,147
No, no. I mean.
Pranhori and you?

548
00:31:04,008 --> 00:31:05,568
Why are you concerned
about his murder?

549
00:31:05,692 --> 00:31:07,804
We are not here to identify
the murderers. We are here to

550
00:31:07,828 --> 00:31:10,068
investigate the incidences
happening at your dad's mines.

551
00:31:10,443 --> 00:31:13,966
Regarding that we
met inspector Borate

552
00:31:14,193 --> 00:31:15,925
and we got to know
everything from him.

553
00:31:16,243 --> 00:31:20,521
The sooner you tell the truth, the
quicker the mess will be resolved.

554
00:31:21,168 --> 00:31:22,684
Your dad is my client.

555
00:31:23,482 --> 00:31:24,808
And you are his son.

556
00:31:25,024 --> 00:31:26,960
It's my duty to help.

557
00:31:27,296 --> 00:31:32,804
Listen, my dad is your client.
Not me.

558
00:31:36,289 --> 00:31:37,559
Amazing!

559
00:31:38,703 --> 00:31:39,981
You may leave.

560
00:31:40,602 --> 00:31:42,268
What will you'll have for dinner?
Mutton

561
00:31:42,293 --> 00:31:43,714
or chicken? Indira
wanted to know.

562
00:31:44,091 --> 00:31:47,170
You will be punished If you
have committed a crime.

563
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,890
Ajit.
- Chicken.

564
00:31:54,022 --> 00:31:55,657
Where is the security guard?

565
00:32:01,683 --> 00:32:02,985
You must have surely noticed.

566
00:32:03,239 --> 00:32:04,905
Just behind us.

567
00:32:07,688 --> 00:32:10,617
Where are you guarding?
Inside or outside? Mohini.

568
00:32:11,715 --> 00:32:13,120
Come Mr Byomkesh.

569
00:32:14,542 --> 00:32:17,114
Go, go outside. Useless.

570
00:32:17,864 --> 00:32:18,967
Come.

571
00:32:19,357 --> 00:32:22,437
Do you want to see the room upstairs
or the living room downstairs?

572
00:32:22,677 --> 00:32:24,709
The room the murder took place.
- Come.

573
00:32:26,062 --> 00:32:30,365
They played cards downstairs
and the old man slept upstairs.

574
00:32:32,508 --> 00:32:33,532
Come.

575
00:32:48,923 --> 00:32:50,558
Body was lying here.

576
00:32:56,454 --> 00:32:57,882
Where was he injured?

577
00:32:58,607 --> 00:32:59,972
Behind his head.

578
00:33:05,806 --> 00:33:07,028
What is this door for?

579
00:33:08,038 --> 00:33:09,546
It leads to the washroom.

580
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:13,136
You can climb down
the house from there.

581
00:33:15,872 --> 00:33:17,229
This was closed?

582
00:33:17,714 --> 00:33:19,032
Yes, it was closed.

583
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:20,877
Are you sure?

584
00:33:21,337 --> 00:33:23,265
Yes, I checked it myself.

585
00:33:23,706 --> 00:33:25,920
Just the front doors were open.

586
00:33:26,326 --> 00:33:29,319
If the murderer had to come in, then
he had to use the front door only.

587
00:33:37,346 --> 00:33:38,910
That means...

588
00:33:39,508 --> 00:33:41,778
Pranhori knew the murderer.

589
00:33:46,516 --> 00:33:48,318
He Let's him and

590
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,599
comes here talking to him

591
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:57,936
and then is hit behind his head.

592
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:12,247
Are you sure this door was closed?

593
00:34:12,487 --> 00:34:13,963
Yes, I checked it myself.

594
00:35:38,992 --> 00:35:40,508
Why is the trunk open?

595
00:35:41,034 --> 00:35:43,732
Oh! It was opened by us.

596
00:35:44,306 --> 00:35:45,980
The key was tied to his waist.

597
00:35:46,689 --> 00:35:49,323
We found 0.1 millions in
cash and a book of accounts.

598
00:35:50,137 --> 00:35:52,661
It's with me. If you
want, I can give.

599
00:35:55,659 --> 00:35:57,008
His relatives?

600
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:58,318
No.

601
00:35:59,042 --> 00:36:00,732
Nobody inquired.

602
00:36:04,262 --> 00:36:05,786
And the office of Pranhori?

603
00:36:06,576 --> 00:36:08,616
It's a very small room.

604
00:36:08,991 --> 00:36:10,673
He was a small time businessman.

605
00:36:11,001 --> 00:36:12,850
I don't think it did well.

606
00:36:15,091 --> 00:36:16,401
Where is Mohini?

607
00:36:20,471 --> 00:36:21,542
Come.

608
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,715
Mohini.

609
00:36:26,461 --> 00:36:28,231
This sir will ask you few questions.

610
00:36:39,981 --> 00:36:41,457
On the night the murder took

611
00:36:42,515 --> 00:36:44,062
place, was the front door open?

612
00:36:44,437 --> 00:36:46,677
I always locked the door once
sir slept after his dinner.

613
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,759
He still had to have his meal.

614
00:36:49,054 --> 00:36:51,030
I was cooking, so I didn't
get to know anything.

615
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:57,416
Did any one else other than
from those 4 men come here?

616
00:36:58,135 --> 00:36:59,833
I don't remember anyone specific.

617
00:37:01,505 --> 00:37:03,655
Since when are they coming here?
- Around 6 months.

618
00:37:08,336 --> 00:37:09,860
Other than gambling,

619
00:37:10,997 --> 00:37:12,677
they must also be
having their meals here?

620
00:37:13,755 --> 00:37:17,064
Sir instructed to cook
and serve them drinks.

621
00:37:26,683 --> 00:37:30,167
Did any one of them
meet you separately?

622
00:37:33,131 --> 00:37:35,884
What happened Mohini?
Did anyone come?

623
00:37:40,011 --> 00:37:42,019
What happened? Why
are you here today?

624
00:37:42,513 --> 00:37:44,275
You were not supposed
to come here today.

625
00:37:59,968 --> 00:38:03,237
Do you know how much money I

626
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:05,383
gave to that old man just for...

627
00:38:06,448 --> 00:38:07,560
Who came more often?

628
00:38:08,109 --> 00:38:09,244
Arbindo sir.

629
00:38:09,572 --> 00:38:11,296
Did you take money from them Mohini?

630
00:38:11,495 --> 00:38:13,177
I am not for sale.

631
00:38:16,859 --> 00:38:18,192
What was your salary?

632
00:38:19,736 --> 00:38:20,847
100 rupees.

633
00:38:21,283 --> 00:38:22,683
Apart from stay, food and clothing.

634
00:38:25,074 --> 00:38:27,106
How long have you been
working for Pranhori?

635
00:38:27,886 --> 00:38:29,029
From Cuttack.

636
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,276
What relation did you
have with Pranhori?

637
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:34,667
No.

638
00:38:35,233 --> 00:38:38,463
He was just addicted to
gambling, nothing else.

639
00:38:40,287 --> 00:38:41,612
Sir is dead now.

640
00:38:42,981 --> 00:38:44,044
Why are you sit here?

641
00:38:44,156 --> 00:38:45,592
The cop instructed me.

642
00:38:46,223 --> 00:38:48,199
Till the case is solved
I cannot go anywhere.

643
00:38:49,432 --> 00:38:52,551
I will solve this case soon.
What then?

644
00:38:55,575 --> 00:38:56,623
What do you mean?

645
00:38:56,774 --> 00:38:58,298
Where will you go then?

646
00:38:59,633 --> 00:39:00,673
To my native place.

647
00:39:03,161 --> 00:39:04,521
Who is there at your native place.

648
00:39:06,243 --> 00:39:07,394
No one.

649
00:39:10,486 --> 00:39:11,709
You re not married?

650
00:39:12,385 --> 00:39:13,464
Your husband?

651
00:39:16,556 --> 00:39:17,890
Where is your husband?

652
00:39:19,321 --> 00:39:21,329
He worked in Military.
He never returned.

653
00:39:27,026 --> 00:39:28,091
Why?

654
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:31,975
I don't know.

655
00:39:34,003 --> 00:39:36,439
Mohini, who else had
come here that night?

656
00:39:38,164 --> 00:39:39,260
No one.

657
00:39:42,026 --> 00:39:43,780
You are not telling the truth.

658
00:39:44,018 --> 00:39:45,804
As there is no proof. Isn't it?

659
00:39:47,021 --> 00:39:49,616
I cannot say anything
about rich people.

660
00:39:50,344 --> 00:39:53,043
Just know this very well
that I am not on sale.

661
00:39:55,342 --> 00:39:56,953
I will be back again Mohini.

662
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,607
Think well and answer.

663
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:02,174
Or you will be in trouble.

664
00:40:03,693 --> 00:40:05,709
Let's go Borate.
- Yes, come.

665
00:40:12,011 --> 00:40:13,543
He was hit from behind.

666
00:40:13,823 --> 00:40:15,625
The injury is from
the right hand side

667
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:17,450
of his head diagonally
to his left shoulder.

668
00:40:17,594 --> 00:40:18,761
Just like this.

669
00:40:19,797 --> 00:40:21,400
What could have been
the weapon used?

670
00:40:21,767 --> 00:40:23,426
Something heavy.

671
00:40:24,144 --> 00:40:27,199
Some thing like a vase?

672
00:40:27,407 --> 00:40:30,272
Nothing like that. A
bit heavier and longer.

673
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:34,046
Not sharp like a knife and

674
00:40:34,254 --> 00:40:37,230
not blunt like police stick.

675
00:40:37,873 --> 00:40:40,128
That means flat iron rod?
- Might be.

676
00:40:40,351 --> 00:40:43,192
Actually he was hit from behind.

677
00:40:43,481 --> 00:40:44,824
So no injury was found on his face.

678
00:40:44,848 --> 00:40:47,095
I am sure that he was
not hit from front.

679
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,991
He was definitely
hit from behind.

680
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,472
I will keep your
postmortem report with me.

681
00:40:52,577 --> 00:40:53,672
Okay.

682
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:56,795
How was his sex life?

683
00:40:57,941 --> 00:40:59,259
Sal leaf.

684
00:41:02,733 --> 00:41:04,344
Sal leaf?
- Yes.

685
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:07,068
Safe and dry Sal leaf.

686
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:13,209
Can we inquire if
there are any police

687
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:15,311
records about Pranhori
Poddar at Cuttack?

688
00:41:15,418 --> 00:41:18,030
Sure. I will inquire about it today.

689
00:41:18,278 --> 00:41:20,492
What do I do about the taxi driver?

690
00:41:21,608 --> 00:41:23,663
Call him at the police station.
Thank you, bye.

691
00:41:27,185 --> 00:41:28,256
Mr Byomkesh.

692
00:41:28,439 --> 00:41:29,471
Yes.

693
00:41:32,715 --> 00:41:33,747
Good Morning.

694
00:41:34,153 --> 00:41:35,883
Are you Bhuvan?

695
00:41:36,665 --> 00:41:38,117
Yes Bhuvan Das.

696
00:41:38,572 --> 00:41:40,172
I have told everything
to the inspector.

697
00:41:40,429 --> 00:41:43,064
Did you know Pranhori Poddar?

698
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:45,885
Yes.

699
00:41:46,427 --> 00:41:47,443
What?

700
00:41:48,262 --> 00:41:49,421
You didn't tell me.

701
00:41:49,708 --> 00:41:50,803
You didn't ask me.

702
00:41:50,987 --> 00:41:52,249
What did you do for him?

703
00:41:53,069 --> 00:41:55,061
It was a monthly arrangement.

704
00:41:55,739 --> 00:41:57,846
Daily drop the gamblers to
their office and at evening drop

705
00:41:57,870 --> 00:42:00,035
them home. At the end of the
month I was paid 300 rupees.

706
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:01,114
Just?

707
00:42:01,683 --> 00:42:03,675
It was a matter of earning.

708
00:42:05,114 --> 00:42:07,812
Since how long have you
been driving the taxi?

709
00:42:09,028 --> 00:42:10,139
1 year.

710
00:42:11,415 --> 00:42:13,264
The taxi is your own or rented?

711
00:42:14,473 --> 00:42:15,594
It's mine.

712
00:42:15,826 --> 00:42:17,159
Why?

713
00:42:23,134 --> 00:42:24,514
We will meet again.

714
00:42:25,954 --> 00:42:29,002
You have to visit the
police station when called.

715
00:42:29,236 --> 00:42:30,355
Okay.

716
00:42:35,169 --> 00:42:38,042
What happened?

717
00:42:39,125 --> 00:42:40,379
Where are you going?

718
00:42:40,804 --> 00:42:41,994
Byomkesh.

719
00:42:42,656 --> 00:42:43,727
What is the matter?

720
00:42:43,975 --> 00:42:45,507
I know you.
- Yes.

721
00:42:45,849 --> 00:42:47,199
You came to my house at night.

722
00:42:47,566 --> 00:42:49,812
I will let you in.
- You should.

723
00:42:51,323 --> 00:42:52,600
I turn.

724
00:42:52,991 --> 00:42:54,554
And you hit me on
the head from behind.

725
00:42:54,754 --> 00:42:57,515
As per the postmortem report he was
hit on the left hand side. Hit me.

726
00:42:57,604 --> 00:42:58,605
Oh!

727
00:42:59,052 --> 00:43:00,155
What happened? Hit.

728
00:43:01,184 --> 00:43:02,304
The murderer is left handed.

729
00:43:04,298 --> 00:43:05,898
Where are you going?
- To the Coal club.

730
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:07,401
What do I do?

731
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,647
Sir.

732
00:43:15,048 --> 00:43:16,628
Good morning Mr Arbindo.

733
00:43:17,422 --> 00:43:18,914
I want to talk to you.

734
00:43:19,542 --> 00:43:21,574
My name is Byomkesh Bakshi.

735
00:43:21,955 --> 00:43:23,042
Lizard.

736
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:26,330
And he is your tail, Ajit.

737
00:43:27,897 --> 00:43:29,182
I am a writer.

738
00:43:30,425 --> 00:43:32,251
I guess you don't read at all.

739
00:43:32,441 --> 00:43:33,584
No.

740
00:43:34,013 --> 00:43:35,220
Not Bangla.

741
00:43:40,985 --> 00:43:42,071
Okay.

742
00:43:42,938 --> 00:43:46,406
Actually, I don't prefer reading
Bengali detective novels.

743
00:43:47,481 --> 00:43:48,823
Specially

744
00:43:49,507 --> 00:43:51,213
the detective wearing dhoti.

745
00:43:52,145 --> 00:43:55,486
Your stories are

746
00:43:56,164 --> 00:43:57,887
fine for our ladies.

747
00:43:58,573 --> 00:43:59,795
But we.

748
00:44:01,283 --> 00:44:05,188
Who have already read
Agatha Christy and Nicato.

749
00:44:05,858 --> 00:44:08,993
Your stories are
extremely boring to them.

750
00:44:09,991 --> 00:44:12,808
You can become a leader
without a sword and a shield.

751
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:15,111
But not detective.

752
00:44:16,179 --> 00:44:17,242
Forget it.

753
00:44:17,759 --> 00:44:20,100
You are surely not here to
discuss about your story books.

754
00:44:20,765 --> 00:44:21,908
What do you want?

755
00:44:23,172 --> 00:44:24,616
Why did you go to Pranhori house?

756
00:44:25,276 --> 00:44:26,554
To gamble.

757
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:28,699
And Mohini?

758
00:44:31,936 --> 00:44:33,436
Mohini doesn't matter to me.

759
00:44:33,721 --> 00:44:35,721
I don't care what she says.

760
00:44:36,272 --> 00:44:38,360
But you didn't stop
yourself from enjoying her.

761
00:44:38,774 --> 00:44:40,337
Or is it a wrong?

762
00:44:44,972 --> 00:44:47,114
I don't care.

763
00:44:48,316 --> 00:44:49,689
First prove it.

764
00:44:49,919 --> 00:44:52,228
I was there on the night
the murder took place.

765
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:56,349
And you Mr Ajit.

766
00:44:57,195 --> 00:44:59,417
Try to make your stories engaging.

767
00:45:00,643 --> 00:45:03,905
Byomkesh Bakshi is too boring.

768
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:08,035
Just keep blabbering.

769
00:45:08,412 --> 00:45:09,912
No action.

770
00:45:10,775 --> 00:45:12,339
Byomkesh.

771
00:45:13,133 --> 00:45:14,747
First of all, I will
prove that you were

772
00:45:14,772 --> 00:45:16,189
there on the night
he was murdered.

773
00:45:16,389 --> 00:45:18,072
Shakeel, Taxi wala.

774
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:19,946
Second the murderer was lefty.

775
00:45:20,481 --> 00:45:24,005
I will take just 2 minutess in court
to prove that you are lefty too.

776
00:45:25,108 --> 00:45:27,917
And I will need just 2 days to find
out what was the motive behind it.

777
00:45:28,356 --> 00:45:31,753
It doesn't matter if you
like Byomkesh Bakshi or not.

778
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:35,146
What matters? Think
before you speak.

779
00:45:36,023 --> 00:45:38,610
One more thing. Tell
your elder brother.

780
00:45:39,097 --> 00:45:43,623
Giving bribe and using his contacts
will not help you to shut the case.

781
00:45:44,307 --> 00:45:45,561
Let's go Ajit.

782
00:45:52,097 --> 00:45:54,192
What?

783
00:45:55,299 --> 00:45:56,616
Good Morning.

784
00:45:56,918 --> 00:45:58,918
I am Mrigan. Mrigan Mallik.

785
00:45:59,348 --> 00:46:00,752
I am Byomkesh Bakshi. Tell me.

786
00:46:00,912 --> 00:46:03,024
I know. I saw everything.

787
00:46:03,294 --> 00:46:05,429
Actually, I am a
member of this club.

788
00:46:06,742 --> 00:46:08,464
I wanted to talk to you.

789
00:46:14,031 --> 00:46:15,261
Here?

790
00:46:15,725 --> 00:46:18,645
No, I have my car. I will drop you.

791
00:46:19,712 --> 00:46:21,472
We were introduced with
Pranhori at the club.

792
00:46:21,799 --> 00:46:23,331
Gambling was not
allowed at the club.

793
00:46:25,105 --> 00:46:26,764
He arranged everything at his house.

794
00:46:27,712 --> 00:46:30,434
We went to gamble to his
house three days a week.

795
00:46:32,558 --> 00:46:36,145
Pranhori arranged

796
00:46:36,522 --> 00:46:38,189
for food and drinks.

797
00:46:38,444 --> 00:46:39,793
Mohini?

798
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:44,100
That was an additional shot.

799
00:46:45,077 --> 00:46:46,514
That I didn't go for.

800
00:46:47,223 --> 00:46:48,588
Did they go for it?

801
00:46:49,202 --> 00:46:50,710
First Arbindo.

802
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:52,778
Then Punish.

803
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,668
Modhumoy is like me.

804
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,520
He is not interested in
anything other than gambling.

805
00:46:59,006 --> 00:47:00,371
Then?

806
00:47:02,974 --> 00:47:04,958
'Sir.'

807
00:47:05,975 --> 00:47:10,372
'Hey, What is happening?'

808
00:47:10,476 --> 00:47:12,923
'What do you think of yourself?'

809
00:47:13,259 --> 00:47:15,997
'What are you doing?'

810
00:47:16,351 --> 00:47:20,622
'This is not the way.
- Leave.'

811
00:47:20,695 --> 00:47:23,663
'He is a cheat. Thief.'

812
00:47:24,024 --> 00:47:28,830
'You are a thief.'

813
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:31,064
'Stop.'

814
00:47:31,374 --> 00:47:34,112
'That man is cheating on us.'

815
00:47:34,290 --> 00:47:36,576
'He needs to be taught a lesson.'

816
00:47:37,581 --> 00:47:39,660
'He is right.
- What will you do?'

817
00:47:41,726 --> 00:47:43,418
'I will have him beaten
and get back my money.'

818
00:47:43,442 --> 00:47:46,133
'Arbindo is right. - If he
doesn't give back our money?'

819
00:47:47,003 --> 00:47:50,796
'He is bound to give.'

820
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:53,695
'Arbindo is absolutely correct.'

821
00:47:53,977 --> 00:47:55,961
'Hit him. Kill him.'

822
00:47:56,072 --> 00:47:58,794
'You will kill him.
Is it so simple?'

823
00:47:59,070 --> 00:48:02,514
'We go to his house daily.
We are being cheated.'

824
00:48:02,643 --> 00:48:04,587
'I have lost 30 thousand bugs.'

825
00:48:04,716 --> 00:48:07,303
'Everyone has lost money.
Forget about the money.'

826
00:48:08,032 --> 00:48:09,413
'Have you lost your
wife's jeweleries?'

827
00:48:09,438 --> 00:48:10,652
'I have lost my
wife's jeweleries.'

828
00:48:10,676 --> 00:48:14,351
'40 thousand.'

829
00:48:14,881 --> 00:48:16,325
'Wait.'

830
00:48:17,614 --> 00:48:19,670
'I have lost 45 thousand.'

831
00:48:21,555 --> 00:48:22,793
'What?'

832
00:48:23,414 --> 00:48:24,993
'What do you want to say?'

833
00:48:25,384 --> 00:48:27,963
'The old man keeps the'

834
00:48:28,473 --> 00:48:29,758
'trunks key tied to his waist.

835
00:48:30,786 --> 00:48:33,413
'Will bade him good bye,
then injure the old man.'

836
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:35,898
'And come back taking all
the money from the trunk.'

837
00:48:35,955 --> 00:48:37,995
'Whatever we need to do,
we have to do it at night.'

838
00:48:38,562 --> 00:48:41,319
'We just need to manage that girl.
What's her name? Mohini.'

839
00:48:41,558 --> 00:48:44,161
'Forget about Mohini.'

840
00:48:44,762 --> 00:48:48,159
'She is just a maid. Police will
not arrest us based on her witness.'

841
00:48:48,591 --> 00:48:49,662
'Nonsense.'

842
00:48:50,665 --> 00:48:53,728
'I will kill him. - You are
saying the same thing repeatedly.'

843
00:48:53,865 --> 00:48:56,405
Will kill him? Is it a solution?

844
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:59,060
Whether I get the money or no,
I will just kill him. - Relax.'

845
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:03,754
'Listen, we will go by the taxi.'

846
00:49:04,121 --> 00:49:07,414
'We will park the taxi
behind Pranhori's house.'

847
00:49:09,102 --> 00:49:11,241
'Wait here, we will be back soon.'

848
00:49:11,393 --> 00:49:13,297
'We might take some
time, don't go anywhere.'

849
00:49:13,639 --> 00:49:16,528
'Arbindo, why did you
get your revolver?'

850
00:49:17,385 --> 00:49:20,591
'Shut up. We will move as planned.'

851
00:49:20,815 --> 00:49:22,966
'As planned okay.'

852
00:49:23,113 --> 00:49:24,734
'No changes. I am moving.'

853
00:49:25,543 --> 00:49:29,966
'Punish, he is very angry. We will
be in trouble if he fires the gun.'

854
00:49:30,045 --> 00:49:32,998
'I have a torch, you have a stick.
This is sufficient.'

855
00:49:33,118 --> 00:49:35,261
'Feeling too bad for the old man?'

856
00:49:35,377 --> 00:49:37,616
'He has not just taken
our money for gambling.'

857
00:49:37,799 --> 00:49:40,580
'Using Mohini, he took
money from me and Arbindo.'

858
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:43,202
'Will you'll stop? I am going.'

859
00:50:12,907 --> 00:50:16,304
'I didn't go upstairs.
I was alone downstairs.'

860
00:50:16,789 --> 00:50:19,773
'I really don't know
where was Arbindo.'

861
00:50:20,695 --> 00:50:23,719
'I won't be able to
say for sure if Punish'

862
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:26,279
'was near the taxi
or somewhere else.'

863
00:50:29,364 --> 00:50:30,634
'Where is the old man?'

864
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:33,477
'He is upstairs in his bedroom.'

865
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:36,741
'Where are you going?'

866
00:50:37,466 --> 00:50:39,244
'No idea, what's going on?'

867
00:50:43,396 --> 00:50:46,023
'Hello!'

868
00:50:46,788 --> 00:50:49,724
'What are you doing standing here?
- Punish went upstairs.'

869
00:50:49,941 --> 00:50:52,155
'Who? - Punish went upstairs,
didn't you see him?'

870
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:54,309
'Where is Modhumoy?'

871
00:50:54,905 --> 00:50:57,969
'Where is Modhumoy?
- I didn't see him.'

872
00:50:58,085 --> 00:51:00,885
'Don't know what to do with you'll.
- The door is closed from inside.'

873
00:51:01,487 --> 00:51:03,249
'What do you mean by
the door is closed?'

874
00:51:03,433 --> 00:51:06,948
'The door is locked from inside.'

875
00:51:07,952 --> 00:51:10,233
'Where are you going now?
- Arbindo is acting too smart.'

876
00:51:10,383 --> 00:51:12,530
'I told him that the door
is closed from inside'

877
00:51:12,555 --> 00:51:14,754
'then why did
he have to go alone?'

878
00:51:14,867 --> 00:51:16,115
'What does he thinks of himself?'

879
00:51:16,139 --> 00:51:19,338
'Let's go.
- Modhumoy held me there.'

880
00:51:19,537 --> 00:51:22,275
'Stop it. You have been repeating
the same thing. - Won't I tell?'

881
00:51:22,476 --> 00:51:23,796
'Amazing.'

882
00:51:23,995 --> 00:51:29,178
'Modhumoy said he has a gun.
I am not liking this anymore.'

883
00:51:31,078 --> 00:51:32,555
'I have been waiting
here since a long time.'

884
00:51:32,579 --> 00:51:35,531
'I too was there. What
would I have done?'

885
00:51:35,834 --> 00:51:40,017
'Where were you?
- Don't act smart.'

886
00:51:40,228 --> 00:51:43,466
"Nothing can be done when angry.'

887
00:51:45,483 --> 00:51:49,007
'The old man is dead.
He has been murdered.'

888
00:51:49,127 --> 00:51:51,913
'What are you saying? Move.
Will tell you later.'

889
00:51:54,762 --> 00:51:58,072
'How did he die? Quick, hurry up.'

890
00:51:58,431 --> 00:52:00,113
You don't know where was Modhumoy.

891
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:01,943
No.

892
00:52:03,318 --> 00:52:05,929
You had a knife,
Modhumoy had a torch,

893
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:08,948
Arbindo had a gun.

894
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:10,457
What did Punish have?

895
00:52:10,950 --> 00:52:13,311
A small iron hammer.

896
00:52:13,838 --> 00:52:15,768
After Punish went
inside, for how long

897
00:52:15,793 --> 00:52:17,672
were you and Arbindo
waiting outside?

898
00:52:18,214 --> 00:52:21,357
For just few minutes. Don't
remember the exact time.

899
00:52:21,836 --> 00:52:25,154
Thanks for coming ahead. Hope
you are telling me the truth.

900
00:52:28,084 --> 00:52:30,695
I know a lot about you Mr Byomkesh.

901
00:52:31,228 --> 00:52:32,482
And Mr Ajit,

902
00:52:33,142 --> 00:52:36,111
I know that your
stories are not fake.

903
00:52:37,497 --> 00:52:39,322
Arbindo might think that

904
00:52:40,183 --> 00:52:42,548
he can escape from you'll.

905
00:52:42,962 --> 00:52:44,105
Not me.

906
00:52:44,639 --> 00:52:46,107
And trust me,

907
00:52:47,166 --> 00:52:48,317
I didn't kill anyone.

908
00:52:48,564 --> 00:52:50,136
Who do you think did it?

909
00:52:51,123 --> 00:52:52,305
I don't know.

910
00:52:53,155 --> 00:52:57,394
We all have lost a lot of money.
30, 35, 25.

911
00:52:58,901 --> 00:53:00,425
Modhumoy lost the most.

912
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:03,385
Let's go to Modhumoy's house.
What do you say Ajit?

913
00:53:03,602 --> 00:53:05,014
No use going there.

914
00:53:05,366 --> 00:53:06,770
He won't tell the truth.

915
00:53:07,385 --> 00:53:10,853
Actually we had all decided
that we will not tell the truth.

916
00:53:12,017 --> 00:53:13,691
In fact Punish,

917
00:53:14,106 --> 00:53:17,701
called and informed us that you'll
are investigating the murder.

918
00:53:18,366 --> 00:53:20,399
Then you too call
and inform Modhumoy

919
00:53:20,424 --> 00:53:22,242
and inform him to
tell the truth.

920
00:53:25,252 --> 00:53:27,252
Modhumoy is a lawyer
by profession.

921
00:53:28,115 --> 00:53:29,599
I can show you the place.

922
00:53:30,252 --> 00:53:32,681
'Mrigan leaves, showing'

923
00:53:32,944 --> 00:53:34,460
'us Modhumoy's chamber.'

924
00:53:34,922 --> 00:53:36,517
'We hire a cab.'

925
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:39,701
'And keep going around
Modhumoy's chamber.'

926
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:44,333
What do you think, is
Mrigan telling the truth?

927
00:53:45,528 --> 00:53:47,544
You mean to say he is
deliberately lying.

928
00:53:48,508 --> 00:53:50,027
All these people
have got to know that

929
00:53:50,052 --> 00:53:51,532
we are investigating
the murder case.

930
00:53:51,821 --> 00:53:53,901
The people who need to get
scared are getting scared.

931
00:53:54,164 --> 00:53:55,981
And the actual investigation?

932
00:53:57,371 --> 00:53:59,478
Just because Mr Munish paid
us in cash the case is actual.

933
00:53:59,502 --> 00:54:02,885
And because we didn't take the
bangles of Mrs Indira, It's fake?

934
00:54:03,124 --> 00:54:05,894
We need to resolve that too.
- We definitely have to do it.

935
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:07,496
You will do it.

936
00:54:07,763 --> 00:54:09,073
Me?

937
00:54:10,528 --> 00:54:11,822
Byomkesh.

938
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:18,385
Stop the car.

939
00:54:19,109 --> 00:54:20,751
Yes. Stop.

940
00:54:28,522 --> 00:54:30,030
Ajit, Let's go.

941
00:55:11,341 --> 00:55:12,500
Ajit.

942
00:55:50,822 --> 00:55:51,830
Come this way.

943
00:56:05,655 --> 00:56:07,543
Do as I said.

944
00:56:14,925 --> 00:56:15,925
Hey.

945
00:56:18,366 --> 00:56:19,438
Hey.

946
00:56:25,327 --> 00:56:26,462
Byomkesh.

947
00:56:29,807 --> 00:56:32,307
Byomkesh.

948
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:35,849
Help.

949
00:56:36,524 --> 00:56:37,643
Anyone there?

950
00:56:37,802 --> 00:56:38,841
Let me see.

951
00:56:40,032 --> 00:56:41,484
Look up.

952
00:56:41,866 --> 00:56:44,019
After the accident, did you vomit

953
00:56:44,172 --> 00:56:46,505
or feel giddy?

954
00:56:49,579 --> 00:56:51,000
He has been badly hurt.

955
00:56:51,663 --> 00:56:52,846
But.

956
00:56:54,053 --> 00:56:55,753
I am giving an injection.

957
00:56:56,343 --> 00:56:58,882
He has to sleep. Complete bed rest.

958
00:56:59,019 --> 00:57:00,995
Don't let him get down from the bed.

959
00:57:01,609 --> 00:57:04,514
Neither the pulse not the
blood pressure is stable.

960
00:57:04,841 --> 00:57:08,286
I think he should be transferred
to the hospital at Kolkatta.

961
00:57:10,413 --> 00:57:12,206
I am really feeling very bad.

962
00:57:12,771 --> 00:57:14,575
He is in this condition
because of me.

963
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:16,541
It always keeps happening.
Don't worry.

964
00:57:16,969 --> 00:57:18,135
I will be fine by tomorrow.

965
00:57:18,286 --> 00:57:21,508
No sir. No moving from the

966
00:57:21,726 --> 00:57:23,321
bed for the next 24 hours.

967
00:57:23,504 --> 00:57:26,718
It will be good if there
is a nurse for the next 24 hours.

968
00:57:28,090 --> 00:57:29,645
I will take care of him tonight.

969
00:57:29,836 --> 00:57:31,107
That is fine.

970
00:57:31,362 --> 00:57:34,481
But Mr Munish, inform his wife.

971
00:57:36,693 --> 00:57:39,812
Okay, I am arranging for
her to come from Kolkatta.

972
00:57:39,964 --> 00:57:41,202
Not at all.

973
00:57:41,603 --> 00:57:43,175
I will take care of it.
You don't worry.

974
00:57:43,199 --> 00:57:45,469
It's my son's exams.
- Okay.

975
00:57:45,733 --> 00:57:47,384
I too understand it.

976
00:57:50,479 --> 00:57:51,582
Yes.

977
00:57:52,948 --> 00:57:54,932
I am good. How are you'll?

978
00:57:55,825 --> 00:57:58,063
Yes, I can hear you. Tell me.

979
00:57:59,376 --> 00:58:02,353
Your son is very naughty.
He is not studying at all.

980
00:58:03,333 --> 00:58:05,452
Couldn't your friend give me a call?

981
00:58:05,970 --> 00:58:07,890
Is he too busy?

982
00:58:09,966 --> 00:58:11,212
When will he be back?

983
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:13,539
When?

984
00:58:14,764 --> 00:58:17,074
Okay. Fine.

985
00:58:19,038 --> 00:58:20,712
Why did you risk not
coming in disguise?

986
00:58:22,026 --> 00:58:24,994
Would all this happen if I
would have been in disguise?

987
00:58:26,802 --> 00:58:29,564
Would Mrs Indira have
told us about the murder?

988
00:58:31,163 --> 00:58:33,092
What is the use of the disguise?

989
00:58:33,395 --> 00:58:35,697
I kept a irritating mustache for it.

990
00:58:43,771 --> 00:58:45,152
Coming.

991
00:58:49,198 --> 00:58:50,444
Can I come in?

992
00:58:52,290 --> 00:58:53,353
Come.

993
00:58:58,790 --> 00:58:59,996
Tell.

994
00:59:00,656 --> 00:59:02,243
I mean...

995
00:59:02,967 --> 00:59:05,610
Can I talk to Mr Byomkesh?

996
00:59:05,754 --> 00:59:07,040
Tell me.

997
00:59:08,234 --> 00:59:09,622
I mean...

998
00:59:12,184 --> 00:59:15,041
The more you tell, the
less messy it would be.

999
00:59:17,849 --> 00:59:21,199
We 4 friends use to go
to Pranhori's house to...

1000
00:59:21,389 --> 00:59:22,626
to gamble.

1001
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:26,899
Mohini too was an important reason.

1002
00:59:27,210 --> 00:59:31,147
Because you were attracted to
Mohini. We know a lot about it.

1003
00:59:31,984 --> 00:59:33,889
So the sooner you tell us

1004
00:59:33,914 --> 00:59:35,924
about the rest,
the sooner you will be relieved.

1005
00:59:36,083 --> 00:59:38,012
That Mohini...
- Quiet.

1006
00:59:40,835 --> 00:59:43,891
Because of Mohini, I did
not say anything before.

1007
00:59:44,466 --> 00:59:46,864
Because if Indira hears this

1008
00:59:47,286 --> 00:59:48,698
it will be very bad.

1009
00:59:49,401 --> 00:59:53,361
Indira had told me that
she has informed you'll

1010
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:57,461
about me mortgaging her ornaments.

1011
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:01,743
I have no relation with Mohini.

1012
01:00:02,779 --> 01:00:04,374
Ajit sir, I have not killed anyone.

1013
01:00:04,772 --> 01:00:06,407
I am...

1014
01:00:06,702 --> 01:00:07,996
You.

1015
01:00:09,478 --> 01:00:12,454
As much as you try to call
and alert your friends,

1016
01:00:12,997 --> 01:00:16,219
Mrigan is not taking any
responsibility to save you'll.

1017
01:00:16,961 --> 01:00:18,391
Instead, listening
to his statement we

1018
01:00:18,415 --> 01:00:19,818
might think that you
are the murderer.

1019
01:00:19,842 --> 01:00:21,191
Mrigan was the...

1020
01:00:22,497 --> 01:00:25,418
But Mrigan was there before me.

1021
01:00:26,384 --> 01:00:27,654
Okay.

1022
01:00:27,965 --> 01:00:30,000
You said that the
bedroom door was locked

1023
01:00:30,025 --> 01:00:31,719
from inside. Was
it really locked?

1024
01:00:31,831 --> 01:00:34,553
I don't care what
Mrigan had told you'll.

1025
01:00:36,689 --> 01:00:40,586
Let me tell you everything
what happened that night.

1026
01:00:40,913 --> 01:00:43,405
We parked the taxi in a lane behind

1027
01:00:43,536 --> 01:00:46,345
the house and go inside the house.

1028
01:00:47,248 --> 01:00:48,846
Modhumoy started an
unnecessary argument

1029
01:00:48,871 --> 01:00:50,312
as soon as he got
got from the taxi.

1030
01:00:50,463 --> 01:00:53,717
I was delayed to handle it.

1031
01:00:54,852 --> 01:00:58,772
Mrigan and Arbindo had
already left for the house.

1032
01:01:00,174 --> 01:01:01,768
'Mohini is a pious woman. Isn't it?'

1033
01:01:01,896 --> 01:01:03,180
'In presence of the old
man she is so sweet and

1034
01:01:03,204 --> 01:01:04,567
when he is not around
doesn't give us a damn.'

1035
01:01:04,591 --> 01:01:06,853
'I won't spare the old man.
- Listen.'

1036
01:01:07,015 --> 01:01:08,208
'It will be wrong to shoot him.'

1037
01:01:08,232 --> 01:01:09,746
'Hitting him on the
head will be fine.'

1038
01:01:09,770 --> 01:01:12,254
'Why are you talking so much?
The driver can hear us.'

1039
01:01:25,481 --> 01:01:27,679
'Mrigan had reached
there way ahead of us.'

1040
01:01:28,115 --> 01:01:30,711
'I don't know what he did there.'

1041
01:01:31,635 --> 01:01:34,167
'When I reached there, he was
standing near the main door.'

1042
01:01:35,459 --> 01:01:38,395
'I don't know where was Arbindo.'

1043
01:01:39,407 --> 01:01:41,375
'Hey, where is the old man?'

1044
01:01:42,209 --> 01:01:43,336
'Upstairs.'

1045
01:01:47,073 --> 01:01:48,240
'Hey.'

1046
01:02:34,752 --> 01:02:35,792
'Oh!'

1047
01:02:40,027 --> 01:02:41,464
'Where are the others?'

1048
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:44,640
'Modhumoy is not to be seen.'

1049
01:02:44,849 --> 01:02:46,699
'Where were you?'

1050
01:02:46,945 --> 01:02:49,993
'Hey the door is locked.'

1051
01:02:51,786 --> 01:02:54,794
'What do you mean? - The door
is closed from the inside.'

1052
01:03:00,891 --> 01:03:02,929
'Arbindo is just too much.
I told him that the'

1053
01:03:02,954 --> 01:03:04,774
'door is locked then
why did he still go?'

1054
01:03:04,885 --> 01:03:07,956
'He is acting too smart.
- Let's go.'

1055
01:03:09,845 --> 01:03:12,245
'I have been waiting since long.
- I too was waiting there.'

1056
01:03:12,323 --> 01:03:16,045
'Where were you?'

1057
01:03:16,269 --> 01:03:18,992
'Lower your voice.
- Don't talk too much.'

1058
01:03:19,245 --> 01:03:21,514
'Nothing can be done when angry.'

1059
01:03:25,266 --> 01:03:28,838
'The old man is dead.
He has been murdered.'

1060
01:03:29,165 --> 01:03:31,847
'What are you saying? Move.
Will tell you later.'

1061
01:03:34,727 --> 01:03:38,640
Before you reached, Mrigan could
have reached the house and gone up.

1062
01:03:39,328 --> 01:03:40,510
Yes.

1063
01:03:42,919 --> 01:03:44,824
Where was Mr Arbindo?

1064
01:03:45,613 --> 01:03:48,343
As per the plan
made in the club,

1065
01:03:49,132 --> 01:03:52,212
his responsibility was
to keep Mohini engaged.

1066
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:57,231
But I have no clue
where was he that day.

1067
01:03:59,413 --> 01:04:01,437
You had no interaction with Mohini?

1068
01:04:01,565 --> 01:04:03,288
I was attracted to her.

1069
01:04:03,647 --> 01:04:06,758
I accept it. I paid Pranhori for it.

1070
01:04:07,303 --> 01:04:10,533
Indira is misunderstanding me. But I
don't have any relation with Mohini.

1071
01:04:11,308 --> 01:04:13,204
And I have not killed Pranhori.

1072
01:04:13,506 --> 01:04:15,577
It's up to you to believe or not.

1073
01:04:16,654 --> 01:04:18,082
Mr Punish.

1074
01:04:21,603 --> 01:04:24,349
Can you give me a light?

1075
01:04:37,422 --> 01:04:40,949
No need to discuss anything today.
He needs to rest today.

1076
01:04:46,295 --> 01:04:47,629
Can I come in?

1077
01:04:52,190 --> 01:04:54,206
Good morning. I am here
without your permission.

1078
01:04:54,486 --> 01:04:57,169
I can see that. I am busy now.

1079
01:04:57,659 --> 01:05:00,287
I will take some of your valuable
time. I am Ajit Bandopadhyay.

1080
01:05:04,864 --> 01:05:06,736
Whatever others might
have said, I know

1081
01:05:06,761 --> 01:05:08,538
nothing about the
murder of Pranhori.

1082
01:05:08,874 --> 01:05:10,302
I don't even want to know about it.

1083
01:05:10,447 --> 01:05:11,614
Very good.

1084
01:05:12,372 --> 01:05:15,856
You are well aware of the
punishment if you lie in court.

1085
01:05:16,351 --> 01:05:20,105
You are a lawyer or
is it just your hobby.

1086
01:05:26,052 --> 01:05:27,496
You are threatening me of court?

1087
01:05:27,623 --> 01:05:29,194
I am forced to do so.

1088
01:05:29,747 --> 01:05:32,327
Actually my friend was seriously
injured while he was investigating

1089
01:05:32,351 --> 01:05:34,431
the murder case. Which is
known as attempt to murder.

1090
01:05:35,188 --> 01:05:37,410
We won't run back to Kolkatta.

1091
01:05:38,017 --> 01:05:40,232
Don't think so much.

1092
01:05:40,909 --> 01:05:42,194
No use laughing.

1093
01:05:42,371 --> 01:05:45,180
In spite of you being a careless
son of a very influential father.

1094
01:05:45,446 --> 01:05:48,866
You are scared and
lying to the police.

1095
01:05:49,498 --> 01:05:51,394
I agree I am just a writer.

1096
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:53,696
I may not have that
kind of influence

1097
01:05:54,361 --> 01:05:56,932
but I definitely have strong limbs.

1098
01:05:58,477 --> 01:06:00,247
Do you accept the challenge?

1099
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:03,407
I will go away if I lose.

1100
01:06:03,727 --> 01:06:06,290
But if I win, you will
have to tell me the truth.

1101
01:06:07,148 --> 01:06:10,180
You gamble. Assume
this is gambling too.

1102
01:06:12,222 --> 01:06:13,389
Let's do it.

1103
01:06:14,678 --> 01:06:16,651
Instead of hiring a
man and hitting on the

1104
01:06:16,676 --> 01:06:18,694
head from behind, Let's
fight face to face.

1105
01:06:19,643 --> 01:06:20,698
Come.

1106
01:06:21,914 --> 01:06:23,010
Come.

1107
01:06:34,909 --> 01:06:36,401
Come on.
- Not today.

1108
01:06:37,538 --> 01:06:38,713
Mr Ajit.

1109
01:06:41,361 --> 01:06:42,528
Tell me.

1110
01:06:43,608 --> 01:06:45,688
Whatever you'll know is
not the complete truth.

1111
01:06:45,848 --> 01:06:47,380
Then what is the truth?

1112
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:51,114
I didn't hire anyone
to hit your friend.

1113
01:06:52,094 --> 01:06:53,284
Fine.

1114
01:06:54,135 --> 01:06:57,843
But that night, you had
been to Pranhori's house.

1115
01:06:59,197 --> 01:07:00,793
Pranhori was a cheap man.

1116
01:07:01,104 --> 01:07:04,495
A thief, a cheat, a very bad man.

1117
01:07:04,700 --> 01:07:05,930
That is why you killed him.

1118
01:07:06,321 --> 01:07:08,765
I mean, you are
doing social service.

1119
01:07:09,142 --> 01:07:10,483
I didn't kill him.

1120
01:07:10,690 --> 01:07:12,023
Who killed him?

1121
01:07:13,185 --> 01:07:14,994
You write detective novels.

1122
01:07:15,433 --> 01:07:18,521
Now your detective
friend is injured so

1123
01:07:19,118 --> 01:07:20,848
you are filling in the gap.

1124
01:07:22,361 --> 01:07:23,869
I am not a detective,

1125
01:07:26,750 --> 01:07:28,655
nor do I write detective stories.

1126
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,960
Suddenly entering into my chamber

1127
01:07:33,517 --> 01:07:35,462
why are you trying to investigate

1128
01:07:35,964 --> 01:07:38,805
based on my statement?

1129
01:07:39,314 --> 01:07:41,529
I want to listen to your
version of the story.

1130
01:07:43,639 --> 01:07:45,155
I may fake it as well.

1131
01:07:47,041 --> 01:07:49,795
Fine, then tell it.

1132
01:07:50,511 --> 01:07:52,146
Benjamin, a cup of tea.

1133
01:07:52,368 --> 01:07:53,599
Yes sir.

1134
01:08:03,407 --> 01:08:05,478
'Wait here, we will be back soon.'

1135
01:08:05,669 --> 01:08:07,621
'We might take some
time, don't go anywhere.'

1136
01:08:07,979 --> 01:08:10,748
'Arbindo, why did you
get your revolver?'

1137
01:08:11,858 --> 01:08:13,429
'Shut up.'

1138
01:08:13,573 --> 01:08:17,057
'We will move as planned.
As planned okay.'

1139
01:08:17,256 --> 01:08:19,439
'No changes. I am moving.'

1140
01:08:19,823 --> 01:08:23,817
'Punish, he is very angry. We will
be in trouble if he fires the gun.'

1141
01:08:23,912 --> 01:08:27,082
'I have a torch, you have a stick.
This is sufficient.'

1142
01:08:27,218 --> 01:08:29,100
'Feeling too bad for the old man?'

1143
01:08:29,268 --> 01:08:31,713
'He has not just taken
our money for gambling.'

1144
01:08:31,738 --> 01:08:34,339
'Using Mohini, he took
money from me and Arbindo.'

1145
01:08:34,449 --> 01:08:37,751
'Will you'll stop? I am going.
Mohini is a pious woman. Isn't it?"

1146
01:08:37,943 --> 01:08:39,107
'In presence of the old
man she is so sweet and'

1147
01:08:39,131 --> 01:08:40,389
'when he is not around
doesn't give us a damn.'

1148
01:08:40,413 --> 01:08:42,396
'I won't spare the old man.
- Listen.'

1149
01:08:42,421 --> 01:08:44,330
'It will be wrong to shoot him.'

1150
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:46,398
'Hitting him on the
head will be fine.'

1151
01:08:46,423 --> 01:08:48,543
'Why are you talking so much?
The driver can hear us.'

1152
01:09:01,701 --> 01:09:03,856
I thought that if a
bullet is shot, we

1153
01:09:03,881 --> 01:09:06,201
won't be able to pass
it as a theft case.

1154
01:09:07,015 --> 01:09:10,110
Ballistic report, etc

1155
01:09:10,661 --> 01:09:12,296
That is why I didn't want to go.

1156
01:09:12,903 --> 01:09:14,148
But.

1157
01:09:14,738 --> 01:09:17,881
'What do I do?
- Where were you?'

1158
01:09:18,082 --> 01:09:21,494
'Lower your voice.
- Don't talk too much.'

1159
01:09:21,663 --> 01:09:23,949
'Nothing can be done when angry.'

1160
01:09:26,060 --> 01:09:29,306
'The old man is dead.
He has been murdered.'

1161
01:09:29,507 --> 01:09:31,634
'What are you saying? Move.
Will tell you later.'

1162
01:09:34,935 --> 01:09:38,252
As per you, who do you
think is the murderer?

1163
01:09:40,149 --> 01:09:42,053
I don't know who was
where at that time.

1164
01:09:43,795 --> 01:09:44,835
Okay.

1165
01:09:45,614 --> 01:09:49,749
Did you have any relation
with Mohini? - Nonsense.

1166
01:09:50,316 --> 01:09:51,641
She is a maid.

1167
01:09:53,097 --> 01:09:55,327
But Mohini can't be trusted.

1168
01:09:55,622 --> 01:09:57,062
That means she la capable of murder.

1169
01:09:58,363 --> 01:09:59,585
Of course.

1170
01:09:59,856 --> 01:10:02,769
She must have killed the old
man and took away some money.

1171
01:10:06,896 --> 01:10:08,198
You.

1172
01:10:09,581 --> 01:10:12,858
Punish said Mr Byomkesh is injured.
So I came to meet him.

1173
01:10:13,603 --> 01:10:16,619
Punish is not available
so I spoke to Indira.

1174
01:10:23,090 --> 01:10:26,169
Mrs Indira, can I get a cup of tea?

1175
01:10:26,922 --> 01:10:28,295
Yes, sure.

1176
01:10:31,972 --> 01:10:35,416
You have a good rapo
with Mrs Indira.

1177
01:10:37,446 --> 01:10:39,430
Yes.

1178
01:10:39,710 --> 01:10:42,344
Mr Punish said that

1179
01:10:42,666 --> 01:10:45,817
on the day of the murder, when
he goes to Mr Pranhori's house.

1180
01:10:46,025 --> 01:10:48,200
You were alone there.

1181
01:10:48,997 --> 01:10:51,505
Do you remember is the main
door was open or closed?

1182
01:10:51,593 --> 01:10:55,948
I have told you everything I know.

1183
01:10:56,330 --> 01:10:58,060
If I say that you were
scared or that

1184
01:10:58,085 --> 01:10:59,645
you have not told us
the complete truth.

1185
01:10:59,752 --> 01:11:01,332
And Punish has told you the truth?

1186
01:11:02,870 --> 01:11:05,577
Do you know that he has
a relation with Mohini?

1187
01:11:06,660 --> 01:11:08,772
If you don't believe
me then ask Indira.

1188
01:11:09,495 --> 01:11:10,598
Yes.

1189
01:11:11,276 --> 01:11:13,220
I too know some of it. But.

1190
01:11:13,443 --> 01:11:15,887
I want to understand your
and Mrs Indira's relation.

1191
01:11:16,058 --> 01:11:17,783
Now you are crossing your limits.

1192
01:11:17,808 --> 01:11:19,369
All limits have been
crossed, Mr Mrigan.

1193
01:11:19,777 --> 01:11:21,880
My friend was attacked.

1194
01:11:22,390 --> 01:11:24,350
When you have taken the
responsibility of investigation

1195
01:11:24,374 --> 01:11:26,574
then find the real culprit
instead of running behind me.

1196
01:11:27,714 --> 01:11:28,810
Sure.

1197
01:11:29,024 --> 01:11:31,992
Where is Mohini's husband?

1198
01:11:35,245 --> 01:11:36,824
What detectives!

1199
01:11:57,188 --> 01:11:58,879
How are you feeling?

1200
01:12:01,217 --> 01:12:03,042
How did your investigation go?

1201
01:12:05,690 --> 01:12:07,531
Punish and Modhumoy.

1202
01:12:08,464 --> 01:12:09,980
They are not left handed.

1203
01:12:13,414 --> 01:12:15,113
That means the only left is Mrigan.

1204
01:12:15,224 --> 01:12:19,668
Mrigan and Indira

1205
01:12:20,417 --> 01:12:22,107
have a good rapo.

1206
01:12:23,612 --> 01:12:26,644
And Mohini's husband is
some how involved in this.

1207
01:12:32,076 --> 01:12:34,099
What are you doing? You need rest.

1208
01:12:34,401 --> 01:12:37,616
Arbindo was right. Had enough rest.
Now is the time for action.

1209
01:12:37,768 --> 01:12:39,664
Doctor has advised bed rest.

1210
01:12:39,986 --> 01:12:41,582
Borate had come.

1211
01:12:42,370 --> 01:12:46,211
He got information about
Pranhori Poddar's Odisha case.

1212
01:12:49,759 --> 01:12:53,052
Even there, he had started a

1213
01:12:53,658 --> 01:12:55,095
gambling club along with Mohini.

1214
01:12:55,454 --> 01:12:57,367
There was a third person too.

1215
01:12:58,672 --> 01:13:01,387
They came here to Shashtrinagar
to escape being caught.

1216
01:13:05,761 --> 01:13:07,801
Who is the third person?
- Who?

1217
01:13:08,287 --> 01:13:10,239
Suroboti is from Odisha.

1218
01:13:10,707 --> 01:13:12,183
Suroboti.

1219
01:13:13,101 --> 01:13:15,212
Is Suroboti Mohini's husband?

1220
01:13:15,786 --> 01:13:18,476
What about him? Whats his name?

1221
01:13:19,877 --> 01:13:21,052
Bishnu.
- Yes.

1222
01:13:21,165 --> 01:13:22,395
Your tea.

1223
01:13:22,935 --> 01:13:24,030
Oh!

1224
01:13:26,799 --> 01:13:28,204
Can I ask a question?

1225
01:13:28,434 --> 01:13:29,656
Yes, sure.

1226
01:13:31,812 --> 01:13:35,193
Who informs you that your
husband gambles? Mr Mrigan?

1227
01:13:36,937 --> 01:13:37,993
Yes.

1228
01:13:41,195 --> 01:13:43,533
Did he inform you about
his going there

1229
01:13:43,558 --> 01:13:45,894
at night as well as his
relation with Mohini?

1230
01:13:46,954 --> 01:13:49,549
I trust Mrigan more than my husband.

1231
01:13:49,807 --> 01:13:50,824
Oh!

1232
01:13:52,071 --> 01:13:53,938
That is why you wanted
to ensure about your

1233
01:13:53,963 --> 01:13:55,872
husband's character and
if he is a murderer.

1234
01:13:56,543 --> 01:13:58,206
And if that is proved

1235
01:13:58,445 --> 01:14:01,024
you would have eloped with Mrigan.

1236
01:14:01,891 --> 01:14:05,193
I cannot live with a criminal.

1237
01:14:05,711 --> 01:14:06,838
Anything else?

1238
01:14:09,199 --> 01:14:10,501
You may leave.

1239
01:14:18,806 --> 01:14:21,441
Read Pranhori's
account book carefully.

1240
01:14:23,366 --> 01:14:24,715
In the debt column, there's no

1241
01:14:27,912 --> 01:14:29,547
mention of 300 rupees that is to

1242
01:14:30,686 --> 01:14:33,678
be given to Bhuvan Das monthly.

1243
01:14:39,956 --> 01:14:41,716
It's been in mentioned
at a different place.

1244
01:14:41,988 --> 01:14:43,440
That means.

1245
01:14:44,508 --> 01:14:49,087
Pranhori Poddar didn't give money to
Bhuvan Das instead, he received it.

1246
01:14:49,416 --> 01:14:52,099
Then Suroboti...

1247
01:14:53,702 --> 01:14:54,932
Whatever.

1248
01:14:55,273 --> 01:14:56,376
Let's go.

1249
01:14:56,839 --> 01:14:58,108
Where?

1250
01:14:59,047 --> 01:15:01,102
Got a call from Govindo Haldar.

1251
01:15:01,532 --> 01:15:03,532
Mr Arbindo wants to meet us.

1252
01:15:04,695 --> 01:15:05,982
Don't want to go?

1253
01:15:10,251 --> 01:15:11,870
What?

1254
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:14,904
You'll?

1255
01:15:15,058 --> 01:15:18,367
We have come to meet Mr Govindo.
We want to visit his mines.

1256
01:15:18,646 --> 01:15:20,646
I am here for the same.

1257
01:15:20,731 --> 01:15:23,715
Suroboti told me.
For the same reason.

1258
01:15:23,842 --> 01:15:28,191
So that you come to visit
Govindo sir's mines.

1259
01:15:28,291 --> 01:15:30,108
For that reason.
- Yes.

1260
01:15:30,642 --> 01:15:32,191
For the same reason. Just tell me.

1261
01:15:32,454 --> 01:15:33,573
I am leaving.

1262
01:15:36,722 --> 01:15:38,111
Over smart.

1263
01:15:40,004 --> 01:15:41,639
The invitation is
waiting for us Ajit.

1264
01:15:41,838 --> 01:15:43,298
Yes, Let's go.

1265
01:15:50,826 --> 01:15:52,373
Good Morning.

1266
01:15:52,597 --> 01:15:55,217
Will you have some beer?

1267
01:15:55,528 --> 01:15:56,798
Or Jin?

1268
01:15:57,313 --> 01:16:01,512
Mr Detective, do you
indulge in drinks or... - No.

1269
01:16:02,860 --> 01:16:05,273
I do have but I will prefer tea now.

1270
01:16:05,624 --> 01:16:08,759
Vikas, get tea for sir.

1271
01:16:10,223 --> 01:16:11,540
Mr detective.

1272
01:16:12,632 --> 01:16:14,203
Do you want an imported one?

1273
01:16:15,829 --> 01:16:17,535
My local is better.

1274
01:16:22,217 --> 01:16:25,320
Mr Ajit, a very strange
incidence happened yesterday.

1275
01:16:27,052 --> 01:16:28,838
I read one

1276
01:16:30,390 --> 01:16:31,852
of your story.

1277
01:16:32,852 --> 01:16:35,971
Where you go behind your suspect.

1278
01:16:36,356 --> 01:16:39,055
What was the name? Satyakaam.

1279
01:16:39,357 --> 01:16:40,468
Boti.

1280
01:16:40,628 --> 01:16:42,421
Yes.
- Boti.

1281
01:16:42,981 --> 01:16:45,084
Satyaboti.

1282
01:16:45,906 --> 01:16:47,398
The name is bit difficult.

1283
01:16:49,397 --> 01:16:51,611
Tell me.
- Arthum Anarthum.

1284
01:16:52,327 --> 01:16:53,891
Right.

1285
01:16:54,303 --> 01:16:55,589
Meaning?

1286
01:16:56,085 --> 01:16:58,164
Money is the prime reason for crime.

1287
01:16:58,865 --> 01:17:00,127
Nice.

1288
01:17:00,547 --> 01:17:02,016
Not bad.

1289
01:17:02,947 --> 01:17:06,661
A very engaging story. I liked it.

1290
01:17:07,493 --> 01:17:09,327
Did you invite us
here to tell all this?

1291
01:17:09,509 --> 01:17:11,374
Yes.

1292
01:17:13,726 --> 01:17:15,473
Even if you don't
wear a hat and a coat,

1293
01:17:16,383 --> 01:17:19,156
you are not a bad detective.
You are good.

1294
01:17:19,545 --> 01:17:20,807
You are good man.

1295
01:17:21,071 --> 01:17:22,349
So.

1296
01:17:23,001 --> 01:17:25,700
As a detective stories,

1297
01:17:27,037 --> 01:17:28,475
I would like to help you.

1298
01:17:28,831 --> 01:17:30,355
I want to help you a little.

1299
01:17:31,859 --> 01:17:33,010
Listen.

1300
01:17:34,099 --> 01:17:36,369
This case is not very complicated.

1301
01:17:37,746 --> 01:17:39,897
Anything can happen anywhere.

1302
01:17:41,123 --> 01:17:42,226
Just like this.

1303
01:17:42,839 --> 01:17:44,339
So I suggest.

1304
01:17:45,097 --> 01:17:47,740
You need to carry a weapon.

1305
01:17:49,442 --> 01:17:51,204
Keep it, take it.

1306
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:56,351
Let me tell you I am not a
detective. I am a Satyaneshi.

1307
01:17:56,471 --> 01:17:57,759
The simplified meaning of Satyaneshi in
bangla is the who you will find the truth.

1308
01:17:57,783 --> 01:18:01,053
For that I have never needed
a gun and will never need it.

1309
01:18:01,502 --> 01:18:04,494
And secondly, if you truly
want to help me then

1310
01:18:04,815 --> 01:18:07,093
quickly tell me the
truth like a good boy.

1311
01:18:09,457 --> 01:18:13,361
My friends are accusing each
other just to save themselves.

1312
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:16,086
I hope you can understand that.

1313
01:18:16,795 --> 01:18:18,779
Then you should tell us the truth.

1314
01:18:23,588 --> 01:18:25,624
Yes I had been to
Pranhori house that day.

1315
01:18:26,257 --> 01:18:28,384
To forcibly get our
money back from him.

1316
01:18:29,251 --> 01:18:30,909
If needed, would have
beaten him up too.

1317
01:18:31,476 --> 01:18:34,651
You are telling that you
didn't hit him with your gun.

1318
01:18:37,316 --> 01:18:38,380
Listen.

1319
01:18:39,407 --> 01:18:42,504
'When I went up, the
door was closed.'

1320
01:18:42,997 --> 01:18:44,843
'It opened by a slight push.'

1321
01:19:00,986 --> 01:19:04,709
Mr Punish said that the
door was locked from inside.

1322
01:19:07,292 --> 01:19:09,300
Ask him why did he say so?

1323
01:19:10,257 --> 01:19:12,146
He had a iron hammer.

1324
01:19:12,864 --> 01:19:15,071
If Pranhori was hit by it then...

1325
01:19:16,695 --> 01:19:18,782
And what was Mrigan
doing all this time?

1326
01:19:19,324 --> 01:19:20,450
Is this water?

1327
01:19:20,609 --> 01:19:22,014
No.
- This.

1328
01:19:22,532 --> 01:19:23,667
Yes.

1329
01:19:31,703 --> 01:19:35,513
That means, according to you
It's either Mrigan or Punish.

1330
01:19:36,740 --> 01:19:38,420
They knowingly hit him
by their left hand.

1331
01:19:40,323 --> 01:19:41,855
Do you'll know

1332
01:19:42,197 --> 01:19:45,086
that Pranhori was
blackmailing Punish and me?

1333
01:19:45,598 --> 01:19:47,280
Regarding Mohini.

1334
01:19:47,487 --> 01:19:49,059
They say

1335
01:19:49,394 --> 01:19:51,831
a naked man is shameless.

1336
01:19:52,605 --> 01:19:53,994
I don't care.

1337
01:19:54,948 --> 01:19:57,655
I simply don't care.

1338
01:19:58,398 --> 01:20:00,747
But Punish was extremely scared.

1339
01:20:01,201 --> 01:20:04,185
Because of his wife and dad.

1340
01:20:05,865 --> 01:20:08,445
Did you'll pay Pranhori

1341
01:20:08,667 --> 01:20:10,637
the money?
- No.

1342
01:20:11,401 --> 01:20:12,671
I didn't give.

1343
01:20:13,038 --> 01:20:14,347
Punish had given.

1344
01:20:14,651 --> 01:20:16,468
Mortgaging his wife’s jeweleries.

1345
01:20:17,711 --> 01:20:20,219
When you reach there,
where did you go?

1346
01:20:29,073 --> 01:20:30,081
'You?'

1347
01:20:32,292 --> 01:20:33,892
'Does sir know that
you will be coming?'

1348
01:20:33,967 --> 01:20:36,332
'Mohini, I am not here
to meet your sir.'

1349
01:20:40,967 --> 01:20:44,683
'Your sir has sold you to me
for 500 rupees for one night.'

1350
01:20:45,810 --> 01:20:47,739
'I will have to claim the amount.'

1351
01:20:47,963 --> 01:20:50,352
'Money doesn't grows on the tree.'

1352
01:20:50,465 --> 01:20:53,145
'I don't know what sir has said.
It's his matter. You please leave.'

1353
01:20:53,462 --> 01:20:54,613
'Leave.'

1354
01:20:55,862 --> 01:20:58,624
'Don't act.'

1355
01:20:59,573 --> 01:21:01,740
'While gambling with
your sir, didn't you'

1356
01:21:01,765 --> 01:21:03,827
'see our cards
and signal him about it?'

1357
01:21:04,221 --> 01:21:05,245
'What?'

1358
01:21:05,811 --> 01:21:07,653
'Let me know your sign language.
- I am

1359
01:21:07,678 --> 01:21:09,708
unable to understand
what you are saying.'

1360
01:21:10,069 --> 01:21:11,846
'You can't understand anything?'

1361
01:21:13,415 --> 01:21:14,685
'Listen Mohini.'

1362
01:21:15,504 --> 01:21:18,663
'If you want then,
I will take you...'

1363
01:21:36,548 --> 01:21:38,890
'Hey. Where?'

1364
01:21:39,113 --> 01:21:40,383
'Where were you?'

1365
01:21:40,464 --> 01:21:41,983
That means, you directly came

1366
01:21:42,008 --> 01:21:43,648
from the kitchen.
You didn't go upstairs.

1367
01:21:43,688 --> 01:21:45,228
No use beating around the bush.

1368
01:21:45,576 --> 01:21:47,409
You know well that
happened after that.

1369
01:21:47,584 --> 01:21:50,528
Hello! Byomkesh. No, Mr Gagan.

1370
01:21:51,143 --> 01:21:52,667
What? Gave the tea?

1371
01:21:52,922 --> 01:21:54,177
What is the matter?

1372
01:21:54,408 --> 01:21:57,313
Instead of purchasing the mines, you
are going around police stations.

1373
01:21:59,132 --> 01:22:02,602
You know very well that we
are not here to buy mines.

1374
01:22:04,193 --> 01:22:06,119
Then you surely know that
if you try to dig a hole too

1375
01:22:06,143 --> 01:22:08,343
far then there are chances
of being bitten by a serpent.

1376
01:22:08,896 --> 01:22:11,364
You too should know this well
that if the venom is removed

1377
01:22:11,548 --> 01:22:13,294
then we can carry any
serpent in our pocket.

1378
01:22:14,179 --> 01:22:16,472
My pockets are not that small.

1379
01:22:16,609 --> 01:22:17,672
I am leaving.

1380
01:22:18,111 --> 01:22:19,690
Mr Bakshi.
- Brother.

1381
01:22:19,842 --> 01:22:21,247
I am talking to him.

1382
01:22:21,764 --> 01:22:24,653
Hey you, Byomkesh Bakshi.

1383
01:22:25,627 --> 01:22:29,563
You are too proud as the ministers
at Delhi had asked for your help.

1384
01:22:31,385 --> 01:22:33,560
The country politics
have changed a lot.

1385
01:22:34,407 --> 01:22:37,971
Just hiring a couple of men
to calm down labour union

1386
01:22:38,450 --> 01:22:40,442
don't assume that everyone
can be bought by money.

1387
01:22:42,567 --> 01:22:43,614
Let's go Ajit.

1388
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:49,843
Listen.

1389
01:22:51,155 --> 01:22:54,378
Are you challenging me? You are
good looking like the actors.

1390
01:22:55,636 --> 01:22:56,898
Do you remember the challenge?

1391
01:22:57,630 --> 01:23:01,542
Like your heroines, the bullet’s
here are not artificial.

1392
01:23:02,625 --> 01:23:04,776
Blood is not just red colour.

1393
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,729
Thanks for reminding
about the gun.

1394
01:23:06,754 --> 01:23:08,675
Arbindo, if needed
do give me your gun.

1395
01:23:09,162 --> 01:23:10,234
Don't forget.

1396
01:23:10,393 --> 01:23:11,464
Let's go Ajit.

1397
01:23:13,424 --> 01:23:14,647
How did he leave?

1398
01:23:15,734 --> 01:23:17,718
Did Arbindo invite us to have us

1399
01:23:18,284 --> 01:23:20,173
threatened by his elder brother?

1400
01:23:21,504 --> 01:23:23,717
He is scared and wanted
to manage his situation.

1401
01:23:24,969 --> 01:23:26,342
The brother's are dangerous.

1402
01:23:26,572 --> 01:23:28,932
Now they won't hit on the head.
They will directly shoot us.

1403
01:23:30,514 --> 01:23:34,025
In your story, will Arbindo be a
fierce character with lot of action?

1404
01:23:35,223 --> 01:23:37,398
Stop kidding. Let's
go home and rest.

1405
01:23:39,795 --> 01:23:41,152
Before that Mohini.

1406
01:23:46,610 --> 01:23:47,650
Here he is.

1407
01:23:47,841 --> 01:23:49,444
Wanted to talk to you.

1408
01:23:50,201 --> 01:23:51,344
With me?

1409
01:23:51,598 --> 01:23:53,342
Yes. You frequently
come to this house,

1410
01:23:53,367 --> 01:23:55,067
so Let's go inside and talk.
- Listen.

1411
01:23:55,452 --> 01:23:56,904
I don't come here frequently.

1412
01:23:57,279 --> 01:23:59,755
I had 1000 rupees pending
with Pranhori sir so... - Yes.

1413
01:23:59,971 --> 01:24:02,860
I had to talk to Mohini too.
Come Let's go in and talk.

1414
01:24:04,343 --> 01:24:06,486
Come, Let's go in and talk.

1415
01:24:06,901 --> 01:24:09,091
Come.

1416
01:24:17,850 --> 01:24:18,882
Tell me.

1417
01:24:22,021 --> 01:24:23,679
What did you do before driving taxi?

1418
01:24:25,580 --> 01:24:26,747
I drove a truck.

1419
01:24:28,862 --> 01:24:31,422
Why did you suddenly stop driving
truck and started driving taxi?

1420
01:24:31,776 --> 01:24:33,008
I am growing old.

1421
01:24:33,762 --> 01:24:35,611
Truck driving is risky.

1422
01:24:39,794 --> 01:24:41,556
Who gave you money to buy a taxi?

1423
01:24:42,310 --> 01:24:43,334
What?

1424
01:24:44,775 --> 01:24:46,553
Who gave you the
money to buy a taxi?

1425
01:24:47,691 --> 01:24:48,826
I took a loan.

1426
01:24:48,953 --> 01:24:50,096
From whom?

1427
01:24:51,013 --> 01:24:52,468
The one who has
given me the loan

1428
01:24:52,493 --> 01:24:54,203
doesn't wants his
name to be disclosed.

1429
01:24:56,978 --> 01:24:58,042
Okay.

1430
01:24:59,854 --> 01:25:01,568
Okay, you may leave.

1431
01:25:08,610 --> 01:25:09,682
Mohini.

1432
01:25:10,573 --> 01:25:14,342
While gambling, did you
help your sir cheat?

1433
01:25:18,216 --> 01:25:22,208
'I signaled if others card
were better than sir's.'

1434
01:25:22,458 --> 01:25:23,887
'Yes, here you go.'

1435
01:25:26,557 --> 01:25:28,430
'And if sirs card were good'

1436
01:25:29,250 --> 01:25:30,892
'then I use to light
him a cigarette.'

1437
01:25:31,752 --> 01:25:33,339
'Mr Mrigan.'

1438
01:25:33,642 --> 01:25:34,658
Why did you do that?

1439
01:25:35,598 --> 01:25:37,169
Sir gave me a job.

1440
01:25:37,870 --> 01:25:39,282
He gave me food and clothes.

1441
01:25:39,737 --> 01:25:42,269
I had no shelter
after my husband left.

1442
01:25:42,342 --> 01:25:43,982
If not then I had to
become a prostitute.

1443
01:25:45,529 --> 01:25:47,510
You must definitely
be aware that

1444
01:25:47,535 --> 01:25:49,362
your sir wanted you to
do the same work.

1445
01:25:52,449 --> 01:25:53,449
I know.

1446
01:25:55,930 --> 01:25:58,819
Mr Arbindo had come to
this house on that night.

1447
01:25:59,275 --> 01:26:00,291
You said that he didn't come.

1448
01:26:00,315 --> 01:26:02,331
Sir tried to rape me.
I didn't let that happen.

1449
01:26:02,555 --> 01:26:05,778
Okay. That is why Mr Arbindo
killed your sir. Isn't it?

1450
01:26:07,443 --> 01:26:08,562
May be.

1451
01:26:09,739 --> 01:26:11,120
But I don't know anything.

1452
01:26:11,884 --> 01:26:15,400
They are rich people. Police won't
believe a poor woman like me.

1453
01:26:15,758 --> 01:26:17,155
That is why I didn't say anything.

1454
01:26:17,801 --> 01:26:19,509
Mohini.

1455
01:26:20,787 --> 01:26:23,723
You are married. What did you say?

1456
01:26:29,211 --> 01:26:31,496
Quickly finish your
investigation and leave sir.

1457
01:26:31,728 --> 01:26:33,236
Let me return to my village.

1458
01:26:37,489 --> 01:26:38,499
I will.

1459
01:26:39,221 --> 01:26:40,285
Very soon.

1460
01:26:42,504 --> 01:26:43,552
Let's go Ajit.

1461
01:26:45,657 --> 01:26:47,077
Pranhori was very notorious.

1462
01:26:47,588 --> 01:26:49,028
He tried to rape this helpless girl.

1463
01:26:49,215 --> 01:26:51,040
I don't think Mohini is
a characterless girl.

1464
01:26:51,192 --> 01:26:52,240
Is it?
- Yes.

1465
01:26:52,441 --> 01:26:53,601
What else did you understand?

1466
01:26:53,951 --> 01:26:56,284
Any man can become a
murderer for Mohini.

1467
01:26:57,988 --> 01:26:58,988
What?

1468
01:26:59,146 --> 01:27:00,273
Correct.

1469
01:27:00,385 --> 01:27:02,687
A notorious, characterless man.

1470
01:27:02,871 --> 01:27:04,355
The man who used everyone.
- Careful.

1471
01:27:05,437 --> 01:27:07,157
Who never hesitated to
resort to blackmail.

1472
01:27:07,371 --> 01:27:09,429
Why are we so involved
in the investigation

1473
01:27:09,454 --> 01:27:10,950
of such a man? Good he is dead.

1474
01:27:11,262 --> 01:27:12,579
Do we stop investigating this case?

1475
01:27:12,603 --> 01:27:14,043
Let's focus on the actual case.

1476
01:27:14,068 --> 01:27:15,708
Our client has given
us a handsome amount.

1477
01:27:16,004 --> 01:27:18,099
We have wasted a lot of time. - What
do you mean? Where are you going?

1478
01:27:18,123 --> 01:27:19,250
Suroboti.

1479
01:27:22,570 --> 01:27:23,943
Sujit sir.

1480
01:27:24,142 --> 01:27:25,832
Gagan sir too.

1481
01:27:26,288 --> 01:27:30,020
I heard you met with an accident.
Hope you are fine now.

1482
01:27:30,187 --> 01:27:32,560
You know very well why I am here.

1483
01:27:32,681 --> 01:27:36,651
Yes. No.
- Byomkesh Bakshi. Tell me.

1484
01:27:37,909 --> 01:27:39,155
What?

1485
01:27:39,538 --> 01:27:42,117
What do I say? There's nothing
to say. - There's lot to tell.

1486
01:27:42,859 --> 01:27:45,351
You know very well about the
problems at Munish sir's mines.

1487
01:27:45,615 --> 01:27:47,623
Who did it?

1488
01:27:48,508 --> 01:27:49,952
Quickly tell us whatever you know.

1489
01:27:50,216 --> 01:27:51,868
You have been avoiding
us for a long time. If

1490
01:27:51,892 --> 01:27:53,652
you don't tell then I
will have you arrested.

1491
01:27:54,021 --> 01:27:55,108
What?

1492
01:27:56,010 --> 01:27:57,574
For what will you arrest me?

1493
01:27:57,710 --> 01:27:59,178
Because you are left handed.

1494
01:28:00,101 --> 01:28:02,021
The one who killed Pranhori
was also Left handed.

1495
01:28:02,214 --> 01:28:04,539
We can discuss about
the motive later.

1496
01:28:04,906 --> 01:28:06,986
Let us know about whatever
you know by today evening.

1497
01:28:07,337 --> 01:28:08,710
And yes.

1498
01:28:09,187 --> 01:28:12,179
I will take just 1 minute to find
out about your relation with Mohini.

1499
01:28:12,403 --> 01:28:14,586
How many minutes? 1 minutes.

1500
01:28:16,536 --> 01:28:17,742
Sir.

1501
01:28:17,980 --> 01:28:20,988
What arrest?
- Wait, let me understand.

1502
01:28:24,323 --> 01:28:26,045
Wait, listen.

1503
01:28:26,912 --> 01:28:28,516
Did you think and say all that?

1504
01:28:28,660 --> 01:28:31,089
Not at all. Shot an
arrow in the dark.

1505
01:28:31,871 --> 01:28:32,982
Listen.

1506
01:28:33,221 --> 01:28:35,801
Don't go around in this condition.
Go and rest.

1507
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:37,864
Yes I will rest, not you.
- What do you mean?

1508
01:28:38,688 --> 01:28:40,339
You were investigating
the case so well.

1509
01:28:40,833 --> 01:28:42,460
Strike the iron when it's hot.

1510
01:28:42,787 --> 01:28:44,556
Doctor has advised me to rest.

1511
01:28:44,581 --> 01:28:46,486
Don't talk nonsense.
Tell me what I have to do.

1512
01:28:47,316 --> 01:28:48,824
The one who just ran away from here.

1513
01:28:48,990 --> 01:28:50,498
Who ran away?
- Bishwanath.

1514
01:28:51,048 --> 01:28:52,922
Now visit Bishwanath. If
you see anything wrong,

1515
01:28:52,946 --> 01:28:55,066
directly go to police station
and report it to Borate.

1516
01:28:55,241 --> 01:28:57,622
And call me from there.
I will leave.

1517
01:29:08,487 --> 01:29:10,167
'There are many
detectives on this planet'

1518
01:29:10,418 --> 01:29:13,799
'who reach a conclusion on the
basis of a clue or a evidence.'

1519
01:29:14,094 --> 01:29:16,721
'Which means they
believe in deduction.'

1520
01:29:17,530 --> 01:29:21,381
'Like Sherlock homes or
our very own Kiriti Rai.'

1521
01:29:22,281 --> 01:29:24,116
'But my friend Byomkesh'

1522
01:29:24,331 --> 01:29:26,585
'believes on his instincts.'

1523
01:29:26,815 --> 01:29:29,053
'His instincts'

1524
01:29:29,527 --> 01:29:33,011
'says that Mr Suroboti is fishy.'

1525
01:29:33,832 --> 01:29:35,530
'How much fishy?'

1526
01:29:35,857 --> 01:29:38,905
'Which can be known from
his maternal cousin.'

1527
01:29:45,504 --> 01:29:48,815
What? What are you doing?

1528
01:29:48,912 --> 01:29:50,595
Why are you following me?

1529
01:29:50,850 --> 01:29:54,272
I told you to call in the office.

1530
01:29:54,447 --> 01:29:56,320
Office. Offices phone.

1531
01:29:56,449 --> 01:29:58,957
I will hit you so hard.

1532
01:29:59,344 --> 01:30:02,304
Boss said you are wasting time.
Bakshi is still roaming free.

1533
01:30:02,505 --> 01:30:04,687
Tell me why?
- I have done everything.

1534
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:08,348
I had hit him so hard.
But he didn't die.

1535
01:30:08,574 --> 01:30:10,796
You will die now.

1536
01:30:12,268 --> 01:30:14,419
You will die.

1537
01:30:14,619 --> 01:30:18,385
Boss said we don't have time.
Whatever possible do it tonight.

1538
01:30:18,529 --> 01:30:19,958
Or you will die instead.

1539
01:30:20,125 --> 01:30:23,514
I am giving you last
warning or be ready to die.

1540
01:30:28,257 --> 01:30:29,725
Mr Byomkesh.

1541
01:30:30,975 --> 01:30:34,927
Suroboti has been working
with me for a long time.

1542
01:30:36,088 --> 01:30:37,636
He is a very old employee.

1543
01:30:39,190 --> 01:30:41,436
He felt insulted

1544
01:30:42,009 --> 01:30:44,151
because of your words.

1545
01:30:46,132 --> 01:30:49,711
I don't know what
discussion did you'll have.

1546
01:30:50,532 --> 01:30:53,564
So he has decided to quit working

1547
01:30:53,846 --> 01:30:56,862
for me and join Govindo instead.

1548
01:30:57,038 --> 01:30:58,998
Govindo informed me.

1549
01:30:59,359 --> 01:31:01,026
The thing is

1550
01:31:01,330 --> 01:31:03,734
I am not able to
understand what to do?

1551
01:31:03,958 --> 01:31:06,744
What did you do Mr Byomkesh?

1552
01:31:08,075 --> 01:31:10,686
Mr Suroboti is an asset.
I am feeling bad.

1553
01:31:10,902 --> 01:31:12,831
I just said that he
might get arrested

1554
01:31:12,856 --> 01:31:14,537
for Pranhori
Poddar's murder case.

1555
01:31:15,201 --> 01:31:16,582
Isn't it Mr Suroboti?

1556
01:31:18,199 --> 01:31:19,310
Who is Pranhori?

1557
01:31:19,414 --> 01:31:21,946
I am telling who is Pranhori Poddar.

1558
01:31:22,233 --> 01:31:23,753
He was a wanted
criminal at Odisha.

1559
01:31:23,778 --> 01:31:25,378
He came here and
started a gambling club.

1560
01:31:25,761 --> 01:31:28,320
Then he cheated a
few rich people

1561
01:31:28,345 --> 01:31:31,041
in gambling and was
enjoying their money.

1562
01:31:31,579 --> 01:31:33,528
You must have heard
that few day back

1563
01:31:33,553 --> 01:31:35,706
someone or some people
have murdered him.

1564
01:31:36,432 --> 01:31:38,076
Please trust me, I don't
know anything about

1565
01:31:38,100 --> 01:31:40,220
Pranhori's murder. You are
harassing me unnecessarily.

1566
01:31:40,299 --> 01:31:43,426
Yes, yes. But the problems
at Mr Munish's mines.

1567
01:31:43,645 --> 01:31:45,113
You do know about it.

1568
01:31:46,865 --> 01:31:48,564
Your maternal cousin, Bishwanath.

1569
01:31:48,811 --> 01:31:51,383
He is in police custody and
has accepted everything.

1570
01:31:51,669 --> 01:31:54,256
Vinay, bring him in.

1571
01:31:54,409 --> 01:31:55,751
Come in.

1572
01:31:59,395 --> 01:32:01,490
What is there in your
suitcase Mr Suroboti?

1573
01:32:01,816 --> 01:32:05,444
Hey you lizard.
- Hey Suroboti, how dare you?

1574
01:32:05,603 --> 01:32:06,984
No body will move.

1575
01:32:07,724 --> 01:32:09,534
I will take Munish sir with me.

1576
01:32:09,886 --> 01:32:11,410
I will shoot if anybody moves.

1577
01:32:11,985 --> 01:32:15,215
Stop moving. I will
shoot if you move.

1578
01:32:16,213 --> 01:32:17,936
Have you'll understood?

1579
01:32:19,978 --> 01:32:22,619
Mr Munish sensed that
somebody intentionally

1580
01:32:22,644 --> 01:32:24,463
created problems at his mines.

1581
01:32:25,833 --> 01:32:29,587
Mr Govindo bribed Suroboti
to create problems

1582
01:32:29,779 --> 01:32:31,494
at your mines and
eventually shut it down.

1583
01:32:32,006 --> 01:32:34,093
Because he wanted to
take over your mines.

1584
01:32:34,317 --> 01:32:37,372
Flop. This all nonsense.

1585
01:32:38,225 --> 01:32:41,162
Whom are you telling all this?
Are you sane?

1586
01:32:42,255 --> 01:32:45,001
When Mr Suroboti gets to know
that you have appointed me.

1587
01:32:45,458 --> 01:32:47,172
He hires a local goon

1588
01:32:47,275 --> 01:32:48,875
and disguise him as
his maternal brother,

1589
01:32:48,899 --> 01:32:50,419
and tries to hinder
our investigation.

1590
01:32:50,858 --> 01:32:53,414
All the help was
given by Mr Govindo.

1591
01:32:53,661 --> 01:32:54,883
What do I say?

1592
01:32:55,043 --> 01:32:57,257
How is it related with
Pranhori's murder?

1593
01:32:57,569 --> 01:32:59,291
There's no relation. Not at all.

1594
01:32:59,906 --> 01:33:02,851
It's just that your brother got
involved with that notorious man.

1595
01:33:02,990 --> 01:33:04,918
You could have let
go these two cases.

1596
01:33:05,118 --> 01:33:07,991
Why is just my brother
being mentioned?

1597
01:33:08,654 --> 01:33:10,773
Your clients son. Is he innocent?

1598
01:33:10,886 --> 01:33:12,870
Here, Punish.

1599
01:33:13,030 --> 01:33:15,630
Didn't you mortgage your wife's
jeweleries and take money from me?

1600
01:33:15,773 --> 01:33:18,892
To give the money to Pranhori
as he was blackmailing you.

1601
01:33:19,509 --> 01:33:21,382
No use diverting the
topic Mr Govindo.

1602
01:33:21,574 --> 01:33:24,598
Let us first resolve
the coal mine case.

1603
01:33:24,935 --> 01:33:27,483
Then we will move to the
Pranhori murder case.

1604
01:33:30,592 --> 01:33:32,910
Mr Suroboti. Take the gun away.

1605
01:33:33,548 --> 01:33:35,492
You won't be able
to escape from here.

1606
01:33:37,162 --> 01:33:38,845
There are many cops
standing outside.

1607
01:33:40,714 --> 01:33:42,143
Now open the suitcase.

1608
01:33:43,105 --> 01:33:46,478
I know the office money from
the locker is there in it.

1609
01:33:47,945 --> 01:33:51,691
Just to get some extra money
you could betray Mr Munish.

1610
01:33:54,006 --> 01:33:56,069
Munish sir, I...

1611
01:33:59,075 --> 01:34:01,551
The world is running
behind money Mr Bakshi.

1612
01:34:03,175 --> 01:34:04,935
You know so much and
are ignorant about this.

1613
01:34:07,130 --> 01:34:09,575
Munish is at profit
if the production

1614
01:34:10,530 --> 01:34:12,332
at my coal mine doesn't
happen properly.

1615
01:34:13,113 --> 01:34:16,026
Visa versa. If he has problems
at his mines, I am at profit.

1616
01:34:17,497 --> 01:34:18,871
This Suroboti.

1617
01:34:21,202 --> 01:34:22,958
He gets monthly salary
from Munish.

1618
01:34:22,983 --> 01:34:24,694
But is not satisfied.
He wants more money.

1619
01:34:26,017 --> 01:34:29,018
So he works for me. This
Biswanath, who hit you on your head.

1620
01:34:29,526 --> 01:34:30,812
For what? Money.

1621
01:34:32,126 --> 01:34:35,070
Your client's son. For
what does he craves?

1622
01:34:35,630 --> 01:34:36,765
Same.

1623
01:34:38,863 --> 01:34:40,260
This is our world.

1624
01:34:42,328 --> 01:34:43,597
Our world.

1625
01:34:44,099 --> 01:34:45,781
Money is the last word.

1626
01:34:47,372 --> 01:34:49,213
Why are we discussing so much?

1627
01:34:49,461 --> 01:34:51,628
Aren't you investigating
so much for money?

1628
01:34:53,837 --> 01:34:55,647
You won't understand why

1629
01:34:58,694 --> 01:35:01,098
I became a detective.

1630
01:35:02,650 --> 01:35:04,261
Anyway Mr Borate.

1631
01:35:04,459 --> 01:35:06,142
I will keep your gun
with me for sometime.

1632
01:35:06,253 --> 01:35:09,729
I hope, everything will
be back to normal now.

1633
01:35:10,546 --> 01:35:11,705
Let's go Ajit.

1634
01:35:18,697 --> 01:35:20,237
Where are you going Mohini?

1635
01:35:24,466 --> 01:35:26,426
Do I sit here untill the
murder case is resolved?

1636
01:35:26,704 --> 01:35:28,260
How many days can one wait?

1637
01:35:29,813 --> 01:35:32,413
If I say that you are going to
your native place in Bhuvan's taxi.

1638
01:35:33,181 --> 01:35:36,586
Mohini has rented my taxi
to return to her village.

1639
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:42,609
And if I say that Mohini is running
away from here with her husband.

1640
01:35:46,146 --> 01:35:47,420
Prove it.

1641
01:35:48,349 --> 01:35:49,984
You will prove it Bhuvan.

1642
01:35:50,614 --> 01:35:54,769
I believe that you are the husband
who did not return from military.

1643
01:35:56,547 --> 01:35:58,539
At Odisha, when Mohini
lost everything and starts

1644
01:35:58,564 --> 01:36:00,555
working for Pranhori. You
were not there for her.

1645
01:36:02,363 --> 01:36:05,879
Pranhori opens a gambling club along
with Mohini to cheat rich people.

1646
01:36:06,327 --> 01:36:09,208
At that moment, you return
and are in need of money.

1647
01:36:09,857 --> 01:36:11,333
And Mohini craves for a family.

1648
01:36:12,121 --> 01:36:14,010
Pranhori gives you
money to buy a taxi.

1649
01:36:14,361 --> 01:36:16,745
And you gave him 300
rupees per month for it.

1650
01:36:17,873 --> 01:36:19,182
And in return

1651
01:36:19,667 --> 01:36:22,992
Pranhori will tempt the men for
Mohini and cheat them as well.

1652
01:36:25,461 --> 01:36:28,612
You both needed money and
also wanted to live together.

1653
01:36:29,272 --> 01:36:30,955
So you'll tolerate
everything quietly.

1654
01:36:31,546 --> 01:36:33,466
When Pranhori escapes from
Odisha and comes here.

1655
01:36:33,595 --> 01:36:35,896
You'll too come here
to escape being caught.

1656
01:36:36,702 --> 01:36:38,741
Pranhori was using us.

1657
01:36:39,362 --> 01:36:40,934
He was using Mohini.

1658
01:36:41,309 --> 01:36:42,967
So you'll couldn't do anything.

1659
01:36:43,916 --> 01:36:47,911
You knew very well that Pranhori
was planning to sell Mohini.

1660
01:36:50,756 --> 01:36:54,232
You couldn't do anything as the
loan was still to be repaid.

1661
01:37:07,002 --> 01:37:09,915
Mohini used different tricks
and kept the men at bay.

1662
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:12,695
As Mohini just loved you.

1663
01:37:13,102 --> 01:37:14,491
She really loves you.

1664
01:37:14,699 --> 01:37:15,752
"Eat it.'

1665
01:37:15,880 --> 01:37:17,864
You and Mohini wanted an opportunity

1666
01:37:18,429 --> 01:37:20,437
to be free from Pranhori.

1667
01:37:21,454 --> 01:37:22,795
Isn't it Bhuvan?

1668
01:37:25,348 --> 01:37:26,682
You will say the

1669
01:37:28,394 --> 01:37:29,719
rest Bhuvan.

1670
01:37:30,897 --> 01:37:32,445
If not then I will shoot.

1671
01:37:35,496 --> 01:37:36,536
Will you...

1672
01:37:37,076 --> 01:37:38,838
Will you be able to prove?

1673
01:37:40,391 --> 01:37:42,351
When I first saw you Bhuvan.

1674
01:37:43,275 --> 01:37:44,990
You were changing the car's Tyre.

1675
01:37:45,936 --> 01:37:48,587
And you were changing
it using your left hand.

1676
01:37:48,922 --> 01:37:50,361
I drive a car.

1677
01:37:50,630 --> 01:37:52,217
I use both my hands.

1678
01:38:02,398 --> 01:38:05,168
When you have given me the gun then
what is the use of standing here.

1679
01:38:06,459 --> 01:38:07,690
Let's go Mohini.

1680
01:38:08,430 --> 01:38:10,366
What is the hurry Bhuvan?

1681
01:38:11,933 --> 01:38:13,592
First finish the story.

1682
01:38:14,278 --> 01:38:17,611
Mr Byomkesh, I am right on time.

1683
01:38:17,827 --> 01:38:20,073
Exactly when needed.

1684
01:38:20,551 --> 01:38:24,400
What Bhuvan? Tell us
quickly or I will shoot.

1685
01:38:35,862 --> 01:38:37,544
That day when

1686
01:38:38,245 --> 01:38:40,022
they came in my taxi

1687
01:38:41,145 --> 01:38:42,614
to kill the old man.

1688
01:38:44,580 --> 01:38:46,754
I thought that this
is the best chance.

1689
01:38:47,074 --> 01:38:49,179
'Wait here, we will be back soon.'

1690
01:38:49,204 --> 01:38:50,965
'We might take some time,
don't go anywhere.'

1691
01:38:51,251 --> 01:38:52,989
'Arbindo, why did you
get your revolver?'

1692
01:38:53,483 --> 01:38:54,554
'Shut Up.'

1693
01:38:55,478 --> 01:38:58,933
'Punish, he is very angry. We will
be in trouble if he fires the gun.'

1694
01:38:59,051 --> 01:39:02,750
'I have a torch, you have a stick.
This is sufficient.'

1695
01:39:02,911 --> 01:39:06,078
'Feeling too bad for the old man?
'Will you'll stop? I am going.'

1696
01:39:06,587 --> 01:39:08,510
'It will be wrong to shoot him.'

1697
01:39:08,535 --> 01:39:10,056
'Hitting him on the
head will be fine.'

1698
01:39:10,120 --> 01:39:12,779
'Why are you talking so much?
The driver can hear us.'

1699
01:40:16,655 --> 01:40:18,401
"What do you want?
Let's go inside first.'

1700
01:40:18,823 --> 01:40:20,507
'Why did you come through the
back door so late at night?'

1701
01:40:20,531 --> 01:40:22,459
'Let's go inside.'

1702
01:40:22,570 --> 01:40:24,110
'What nonsense.'

1703
01:40:24,901 --> 01:40:27,472
'Doesn't have any work, gets
in through the back door.'

1704
01:40:28,206 --> 01:40:29,865
'All the trouble at night.'

1705
01:40:30,327 --> 01:40:31,569
'Tomorrow...'

1706
01:41:31,679 --> 01:41:32,981
And the back door?

1707
01:41:34,039 --> 01:41:35,380
It was open.

1708
01:41:36,414 --> 01:41:39,129
I assume it was
Mohini who locked it.

1709
01:42:14,972 --> 01:42:17,155
'Mohini, when you
come to serve food.'

1710
01:42:17,609 --> 01:42:19,490
'You see that the old
man is lying dead.'

1711
01:42:20,606 --> 01:42:21,971
'And the back door is open.'

1712
01:42:23,220 --> 01:42:27,088
'As you knew that the route
was used by Bhuvan only.'

1713
01:42:28,505 --> 01:42:32,394
'So you go and lock that
door and save Bhuvan.'

1714
01:42:36,608 --> 01:42:38,100
When will the police be here?

1715
01:42:41,923 --> 01:42:43,312
We will have to inform them.

1716
01:42:44,084 --> 01:42:45,307
It will take time.

1717
01:42:46,309 --> 01:42:48,602
I think, first the police will

1718
01:42:48,890 --> 01:42:51,040
inquire at the station.
What is your opinion Ajit?

1719
01:42:51,473 --> 01:42:52,496
Yes.

1720
01:42:52,886 --> 01:42:56,196
And if they run away by taxi then,

1721
01:42:57,272 --> 01:42:58,843
they will be able to go very far.

1722
01:43:19,579 --> 01:43:21,110
Let's go.

1723
01:43:58,946 --> 01:43:59,962
What happened?

1724
01:44:01,043 --> 01:44:02,059
What do you mean?

1725
01:44:07,154 --> 01:44:08,447
Mr Byomkesh.

1726
01:44:09,171 --> 01:44:10,465
Listen.

1727
01:44:14,748 --> 01:44:16,526
Come.

1728
01:44:20,539 --> 01:44:21,920
Mr Byomkesh. What happened?

1729
01:44:22,406 --> 01:44:23,731
You let them go?

1730
01:44:25,443 --> 01:44:27,871
Mr Ajit. Listen.

1731
01:44:28,222 --> 01:44:29,479
What happened?

1732
01:44:31,013 --> 01:44:33,441
Mr Aurbindo, give me a cigarette.
Imported

1733
01:44:33,665 --> 01:44:36,506
Will inform the police after the
smoke. - Me too. If you have one.

1734
01:44:36,958 --> 01:44:38,260
Yes, you may take it.

1735
01:44:40,220 --> 01:44:41,403
That driver...

1736
01:44:42,843 --> 01:44:43,843
You let them go?

1737
01:44:43,914 --> 01:44:46,541
A bad, notorious man is dead.

1738
01:44:47,339 --> 01:44:49,267
What can be better than that?

1739
01:44:50,971 --> 01:44:54,066
Yes that is fine but Bhuvan
will not be punished. Is it?

1740
01:44:54,211 --> 01:44:55,432
Why will he not be punished?

1741
01:44:55,592 --> 01:44:56,846
You let them escape.

1742
01:44:58,167 --> 01:45:00,000
He will have to keep
running throughout his life.

1743
01:45:00,024 --> 01:45:01,771
He will not be
able to settle down.

1744
01:45:02,066 --> 01:45:04,590
He will always have to be in
a disguise with a fake name.

1745
01:45:05,890 --> 01:45:07,810
Is there a bigger
punishment than this?

1746
01:45:09,521 --> 01:45:10,585
Hmm.

1747
01:45:11,832 --> 01:45:15,214
Your gun was with Bhuvan.

1748
01:45:16,431 --> 01:45:18,764
He worked in military.
A desperate man.

1749
01:45:19,004 --> 01:45:21,536
If I delayed by just 2
second, you would have...

1750
01:45:22,559 --> 01:45:23,829
Yes this is...

1751
01:45:24,020 --> 01:45:26,774
He was wrong here. Wasn't he?

1752
01:45:27,212 --> 01:45:29,537
Your detective who wears a dhoti

1753
01:45:30,152 --> 01:45:33,122
won't do such a mistake.

1754
01:45:40,070 --> 01:45:41,713
Put the gun down.

1755
01:45:42,079 --> 01:45:43,754
Why what is the problem? Hold it.

1756
01:45:43,889 --> 01:45:47,540
'People incorrectly address my
friend Byomkesh as a detective.'

1757
01:45:48,473 --> 01:45:50,108
'He is actually Satyaneshi.'

1758
01:45:51,016 --> 01:45:53,842
'He doesn't help to catch
thieves and dacoit's.

1759
01:45:54,026 --> 01:45:56,175
'It's very important for him'

1760
01:45:56,358 --> 01:45:58,445
'to bring out the truth.'

1761
01:45:58,708 --> 01:46:01,057
'That is why in most of the cases'

1762
01:46:01,273 --> 01:46:03,519
'Byomkesh leaves
the task of getting'

1763
01:46:03,870 --> 01:46:06,219
'hold of the criminal on the cops.'

1764
01:46:06,340 --> 01:46:07,540
No, no. Does he know anything?

1765
01:46:07,682 --> 01:46:10,463
It cannot happen repeatedly.

1766
01:46:10,607 --> 01:46:12,940
I am just winning the game.
Stop your nonsense.

1767
01:46:13,095 --> 01:46:14,815
Ajit, this is not done.
- You are cheating.

1768
01:46:14,970 --> 01:46:17,827
Where am I cheating?
Stop talking nonsense.

1769
01:46:18,307 --> 01:46:22,324
When you have lost...
- Lower your volume.

1770
01:46:22,460 --> 01:46:24,134
My son is sleeping.
- Okay.

1771
01:46:24,400 --> 01:46:26,566
You are cheating.

1772
01:46:26,878 --> 01:46:28,330
Cat.

1773
01:46:28,633 --> 01:46:30,316
C. Write.

1774
01:46:30,675 --> 01:46:32,064
C.
- A.

1775
01:46:32,209 --> 01:46:34,312
'Murder is a punishable crime.'

1776
01:46:35,475 --> 01:46:37,515
'Just like Byomkesh,
I too know that'

1777
01:46:38,178 --> 01:46:41,781
'the society whose foundation is
established by the black money'

1778
01:46:42,197 --> 01:46:45,412
'That society is prone to'

1779
01:46:45,628 --> 01:46:47,262
'greed, crime, selfishness'

1780
01:46:47,598 --> 01:46:49,597
'jealousy as well as blood shed.'
- You can't do anything?

1781
01:46:49,621 --> 01:46:53,660
In that society, greedy people like
Pranhori Poddar and Govindo Haldar.'

1782
01:46:53,940 --> 01:46:56,424
'If one dies, ten take birth.'

1783
01:46:57,174 --> 01:46:59,642
'So Satyaneshi like Byomkesh'

1784
01:46:59,881 --> 01:47:01,802
'may dress in dhoti or pant'

1785
01:47:02,161 --> 01:47:03,401
'In this society, we need them'

1786
01:47:03,543 --> 01:47:05,932
'and will need them always.'

1787
01:47:06,195 --> 01:47:07,378
'Again.'

1788
01:47:07,733 --> 01:47:10,447
'Unexpectedly our telephone'

1789
01:47:10,767 --> 01:47:12,108
'will suddenly ring.'

1790
01:47:19,716 --> 01:47:20,717
'Hello!'

1791
01:47:22,726 --> 01:47:25,138
'Can I talk to Mr Byomkesh?'

1792
01:47:26,905 --> 01:47:28,087
Who is it?

1793
01:47:28,476 --> 01:47:30,295
I am Nishanath Sen.
