1
00:00:17,618 --> 00:00:27,550
The beacon fires on the border

2
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:37,365
The iron cavalry rides a thousand miles

3
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:47,402
Seeking joy, finding peace
in the mountains and rivers

4
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:56,149
The fragrance of wine in the
phoenix pavilion and dragon tower

5
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:02,160
Ambition arises from sorrow

6
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:15,933
The mournful cry of geese
spreads across the northern land

7
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:24,279
Brave warriors embark on their journey

8
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:32,450
To join the army and serve the country with joy

9
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:40,090
To kill the enemy and fill them with fear

10
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:48,197
Toast together upon returning from battle

11
00:01:58,251 --> 00:01:59,809
Please sing it again

12
00:02:04,358 --> 00:02:07,759
I say, change to a more pleasant one

13
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:32,412
Don't trouble the singer

14
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:35,319
Then I've to trouble you

15
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:37,888
Who are you?

16
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:42,828
I'm going to join army under General Zhang
to fight the enemy

17
00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:46,558
Oh, an unknown soldier

18
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,999
Do you know who our master is?

19
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:52,799
If you recognize him, you'll be stunned

20
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,270
Must be a subject of Song Dynasty

21
00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:00,403
Our master is the son of the prime minister!

22
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:03,648
He's one of the corrupt Song Dynasty

23
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:15,258
Kill him!

24
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,070
Murder!

25
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:17,100
My lady, please...

26
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:18,431
You should not...

27
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:20,569
You still want revenge!

28
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,900
But I don't know martial arts

29
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:27,144
What can I use for revenge?

30
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:31,780
Miss, you can't do this

31
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:35,877
With your status, you can gather people to help

32
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,681
revenge for the country

33
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:41,350
You're not thinking about the Song Dynasty

34
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:43,928
You should also seek revenge for your parents

35
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:45,956
Mother...

36
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,076
We've arrived

37
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:49,447
Uncle, this is General Wang

38
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,416
The honorable general

39
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:52,991
This is our General's daughter

40
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:57,857
The honorable general

41
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:01,591
The daughter of General
Zhang and everyone

42
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:04,134
We all warmly welcome you

43
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:11,000
Have you heard that the border
has been breached by the Jin army?

44
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:13,806
General Zhang served the country faithfully

45
00:10:15,582 --> 00:10:18,483
General Zhang is an extraordinary loyal minister

46
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,815
Everyone is here, what can I do?
Just give your orders

47
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:28,923
Excuse us for coming abruptly

48
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:31,920
Please consider that we are all common people

49
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:34,829
Besides asking for your shelter

50
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,266
There are a few more things to discuss

51
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:39,003
I'm expecting your instruction

52
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,970
Tell everyone in the village

53
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:45,373
No one is allowed to mention
that the miss is staying here

54
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:46,777
Understood

55
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:48,471
we need to set up headquarters here

56
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:51,584
Gather heroes from all directions to seek revenge

57
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:54,516
Reclaim our lost territory

58
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:33,342
Just a moment!

59
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,353
You're here to audition, not to fight for your life

60
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:47,121
What do you do?

61
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,598
I...

62
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:07,444
Are we comparing fists or weapons?

63
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:11,046
You're not good enough.

64
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,219
How about that guy over there.

65
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:18,696
At your service

66
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:22,434
Alright, another lesson.

67
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:25,064
Please...

68
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:27,728
Take care

69
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:57,663
Ta Kuan!

70
00:13:58,338 --> 00:13:59,896
Just another big mouth

71
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:10,145
Big Fatty, Second Fatty, both can try

72
00:14:10,283 --> 00:14:11,477
Please forgive me for

73
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:14,245
not recognising your ability

74
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:16,445
Don't be too polite

75
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:19,319
I don't care for niceties.

76
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:22,485
May I ask your name?

77
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,823
Just a prisoner

78
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,595
Could I test you?

79
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:31,363
Please give me a blade

80
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:07,431
You are really the man we need

81
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,768
to drive out the invaders

82
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:13,908
killing the Jin people...
I might be interested.

83
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:17,072
But now I have a condition

84
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:18,979
If you serve the country

85
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:20,676
We will reward you

86
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,947
You tell me, any conditions

87
00:15:23,823 --> 00:15:27,691
I just want to see your lady

88
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:29,522
Our lady?

89
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:32,088
She is not here!

90
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:34,165
You are not a honest man.

91
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,326
I came here just for her

92
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,405
Since she's not here, I'll leave

93
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:42,804
Please stay, sir

94
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:47,574
Which lady are you talking about

95
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:51,674
General Zhang's daughter

96
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:42,500
I heard Zhang Zhe has a daughter,

97
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:44,626
I didn't expect her to be so beautiful

98
00:16:45,605 --> 00:16:48,870
It seems fortune favours me!

99
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:55,041
Don't be imprudent

100
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,820
Uncle Wang, who is he?

101
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:05,753
Why do you bring him to see me?

102
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:08,859
We've tried to recruit for days

103
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:11,896
He is the only one with
real martial arts skills

104
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,965
He wants to see you

105
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:20,433
Since you are a knight,
please take a seat

106
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:29,046
This seat is vacant

107
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:32,446
You must know the purpose
of our recruitment,

108
00:17:32,585 --> 00:17:36,316
to expel the Jin and recover the territory

109
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:40,892
On the other hand,
it is also to avenge father

110
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:44,019
Simply put,
you need a group of fearless people

111
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:47,064
To fight the Jin soldiers to the death

112
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:49,895
Are you willing to take on
this heavy responsibility?

113
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:54,136
It depends on the conditions you offer me

114
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:56,207
Don't push your luck

115
00:17:56,342 --> 00:17:58,003
Why are there more conditions?

116
00:17:58,144 --> 00:18:01,011
I don't want to risk my life for you for no reason

117
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,079
If you don't want to, then get lost

118
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:05,774
You're not a citizen of the Song Dynasty

119
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,408
Don't be disrespectful

120
00:18:08,688 --> 00:18:11,213
We are also people who have lost their homes

121
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:13,951
and haven’t much money with us

122
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:18,427
We have no authority to offer you
a high rank position.

123
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:22,295
I don't care about high positions or wealth.

124
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,596
What I want is you

125
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:26,568
What did you say?

126
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:29,436
I've been wandering for many years

127
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:32,339
But I still haven't found a wife

128
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:35,846
What I wish is to marry you

129
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,110
Damn madman

130
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:46,816
Don't be impolite

131
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:33,499
This girl is quick and ruthless.

132
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:36,267
Eight darts in a throw

133
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:39,066
There's one more here.

134
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:44,272
Bravo!

135
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:45,714
Nothing special

136
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:49,848
But I can still compete with the Jin soldiers.

137
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,085
Sister, marriage is a big deal.

138
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:57,661
It's not a joke.

139
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:18,750
I promise to marry you.

140
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:25,316
But I have conditions too.

141
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:26,948
Let's hear it.

142
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:31,386
I want the head of General Wan Yan.

143
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:36,059
To be offered before my deceased father's spirit.

144
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:42,400
Only then can we get married.

145
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:48,743
I came to seek revenge on you.

146
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:53,951
I didn't expect to avenge you!

147
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:58,420
Ha...

148
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:00,650
What's your name?

149
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:04,461
Jin Shan-Kuo

150
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:20,940
Miss, don't worry.

151
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,880
No matter what,
you won't marry that barbarian.

152
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:27,918
As long as he can bring back Wan Yan's head

153
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:30,988
to avenge my father

154
00:21:32,258 --> 00:21:36,490
Chun Mei, is his martial arts great?

155
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:40,326
High martial arts skill, low character.

156
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:41,966
Who?

157
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:44,399
It's me, Wang Fuon

158
00:21:54,847 --> 00:22:00,012
Uncle Wang, is there something?

159
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:05,651
Miss, please forgive me.
I'm afraid I've erred.

160
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:08,988
Jin Shan-Kuo is a fugitive.

161
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,429
What grudge does he have with my father?

162
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:14,863
He killed the Premier's son

163
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,835
He was sentenced to death by General Zhang,
but he escaped.

164
00:22:19,972 --> 00:22:22,998
I don't know how he ended up here.

165
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:25,638
It doesn't matter.

166
00:22:25,778 --> 00:22:27,803
What do you think of his martial arts skills?

167
00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:30,279
Rarely seen in a hundred years.

168
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:34,113
Then let's make good use of him.

169
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,883
But he wants to marry the miss.

170
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:43,093
Having avenged my father

171
00:22:43,229 --> 00:22:46,596
I have no attachment to the world.

172
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:49,997
He won't marry a dead person.

173
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,330
Lady...

174
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:56,737
Our miss is the General's daughter.

175
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:59,037
What are you?

176
00:22:59,178 --> 00:23:01,203
A murderer and fugitive.

177
00:23:01,347 --> 00:23:03,110
You're not even worthy to speak with her

178
00:23:03,249 --> 00:23:04,978
You actually want to marry her?

179
00:23:05,117 --> 00:23:06,516
You're really a shameless guy

180
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:09,910
Have you eaten a lot?

181
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:13,391
Are you done cursing?

182
00:23:16,028 --> 00:23:17,962
If you're done, please leave.

183
00:23:18,097 --> 00:23:19,758
If there's no more nonsense, continue.

184
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:22,129
I'm going to sleep.

185
00:23:29,308 --> 00:23:30,400
Have you finished?

186
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:31,873
Tolerable

187
00:23:32,011 --> 00:23:35,344
It's this guy, annoying and troublesome.

188
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:43,788
I want to discuss something with you.

189
00:23:43,856 --> 00:23:46,984
How can we obtain Wan Yan's head?

190
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,385
That's my business, don't worry about it.

191
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,065
I can give you some information

192
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:56,531
Wan Yan has four Generals

193
00:23:56,669 --> 00:24:01,538
Known as the Four Heavenly Kings,
each with strong martial arts.

194
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:04,266
The first one is Fan Tong.

195
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:06,742
He is cunning and ruthless,
with excellent lightness skills.

196
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:10,371
He is a famous assassin under Wan Yan's command.

197
00:24:10,516 --> 00:24:11,710
General Fan.

198
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:19,322
I think I'll send you to investigate
Zhang En-Zhu's whereabouts.

199
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:22,622
That's your specialty.

200
00:24:24,697 --> 00:24:26,426
We must capture her.

201
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:31,667
I heard that girl is quite good-looking.

202
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,205
The second one is Hung Tu.

203
00:24:36,342 --> 00:24:38,776
He has immense strength and is fearless.

204
00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:41,038
But he lacks intelligence.

205
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:46,411
General Hung, take some soldiers

206
00:24:46,552 --> 00:24:49,385
Go to the Four Villages to
search for gold and jewels.

207
00:24:50,956 --> 00:24:57,862
If you can find beautiful women,
that would be even better.

208
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:03,362
What if there are neither
girls nor treasures there?

209
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:06,938
What's the point of that village then?

210
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:12,837
Alright, then I will burn it down

211
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:16,671
The third one is Har Cha.

212
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:19,648
He is Kuan Yan's right-hand
man and never leaves his side.

213
00:25:19,785 --> 00:25:22,515
To kill Kuan Yan, we must first eliminate him.

214
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:25,452
General, what mission do you assign me!

215
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:30,924
Your duty is to guard me

216
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,342
The fourth one is Na Sha.

217
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:48,708
He has a skill called Blood Sand Palm,
which can strike through walls.

218
00:25:49,448 --> 00:25:50,938
Quickly

219
00:26:03,429 --> 00:26:05,329
Master Jia, the General has something to say.

220
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:10,331
Tell him to wait.

221
00:26:10,469 --> 00:26:11,800
Didn't you see me practicing?

222
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:14,030
The General said there's an important matter.

223
00:26:14,173 --> 00:26:15,538
Get out of here!

224
00:27:13,866 --> 00:27:15,458
General...

225
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:20,668
Out, all of you!

226
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:27,601
Master, please take a seat

227
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:31,046
How is your Blood Sand Palm training going?

228
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,750
It's about 90% complete

229
00:27:42,895 --> 00:27:46,262
Very good, now don't you think

230
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:49,128
we should continue to advance

231
00:27:49,935 --> 00:27:53,962
But there are still a few things to take care of

232
00:27:54,473 --> 00:27:55,838
Zhang Zhe is dead

233
00:27:55,974 --> 00:28:00,035
His daughter's whereabouts
are unknown, it's a concern

234
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:02,943
What should we do?

235
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:14,523
Jin Shan-Kuo

236
00:28:15,961 --> 00:28:18,521
I'm talking to you, why are you falling asleep?

237
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:22,857
Someone like him will be a
problem sooner or later

238
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:25,128
It's better to get rid of him early

239
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:27,099
You are not a decent men

240
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:29,639
You want to plot against me while I'm asleep

241
00:28:41,954 --> 00:28:43,046
I will go before I get killed here

242
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:45,884
Can you just leave like that?

243
00:28:47,593 --> 00:28:50,027
If I want to leave, who can stop me?

244
00:28:52,698 --> 00:28:54,689
Wait ten days

245
00:28:55,867 --> 00:29:00,304
If I don't die, I will bring
back the head of Shu Wanyan

246
00:29:01,006 --> 00:29:03,634
Will, you go alone?

247
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:05,905
My wife is my business alone

248
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:07,909
If I don't come back in ten days

249
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:10,310
It means the Four Great Kings are stronger than me

250
00:29:10,449 --> 00:29:12,917
Tell your Miss to marry someone else

251
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:39,034
There are no beauties, so why keep this house?

252
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:40,542
Why not set it on fire?

253
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:42,340
Yes

254
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:54,154
Quick! Quick!

255
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:58,793
Hurry! Go! Let's go!

256
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:05,732
Go! Let's go!

257
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:12,900
Let's go!

258
00:30:15,614 --> 00:30:19,744
The girls are not beautiful,
and there are not many jewels

259
00:30:22,187 --> 00:30:23,984
Why don't we burn it down?

260
00:30:49,915 --> 00:30:51,610
Come up!

261
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:03,760
Go away, you are all useless

262
00:31:38,263 --> 00:31:40,231
What are you doing here? Get away

263
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:42,060
Messenger

264
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:49,268
I am the messenger.

265
00:31:50,142 --> 00:31:51,632
Are you Hung Tu?

266
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:02,982
You are Hung Tu, right?

267
00:32:05,624 --> 00:32:08,525
General Hung, for whom is the message?

268
00:32:09,895 --> 00:32:11,658
You don't look like Hung Tu.

269
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:16,530
Come here.

270
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:24,531
General Hung.

271
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:29,479
Back off, I'm looking for the
General who carries a big iron rod.

272
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:32,344
I am General Hung, what's the matter?

273
00:32:32,484 --> 00:32:36,978
There are many jewels and
beautiful women over there.

274
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:39,112
Where?

275
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:42,784
In the woods over there.

276
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:45,526
Wait for me here.

277
00:32:58,677 --> 00:33:00,167
Messenger

278
00:33:02,214 --> 00:33:04,079
Messenger

279
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,283
Messenger

280
00:33:15,694 --> 00:33:17,218
Messenger

281
00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:23,993
I am here

282
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,070
Where is the treasure?

283
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:31,202
Under the ground

284
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:40,898
Dig a bigger hole. You have a big body.

285
00:33:40,899 --> 00:33:42,678
Dig more

286
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:56,266
You'll see them when you're about die

287
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:06,375
Who are you?

288
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:08,035
A messenger

289
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:09,510
Who sent you?

290
00:34:09,648 --> 00:34:11,582
The King of Hell sent me.

291
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,757
What's over there?

292
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,425
I'm right here.

293
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:10,033
Hung Tu!

294
00:35:47,012 --> 00:35:50,072
They say you have unlimited strength.

295
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:54,012
I see you! You're just a dumb brute.

296
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:15,603
Hung Tu! Why don't you leave the trees alone?

297
00:37:39,791 --> 00:37:40,849
That is the man we want

298
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:56,498
Waiter! I need a room

299
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:57,869
What?

300
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:03,211
A guest room?

301
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:10,887
Yes, a guest room

302
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:15,223
I think you should go somewhere else.

303
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,759
What?

304
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:34,677
Innkeeper, don't be afraid.

305
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:38,909
I'm an old friend of General Hung.

306
00:39:05,777 --> 00:39:09,269
Sorry to bother you, is it okay?

307
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:21,892
Good wine

308
00:39:27,432 --> 00:39:28,956
How does it taste?

309
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:33,995
Anyone who dares to come will lose their life.

310
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:42,242
Take the staff back to your boss.

311
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:46,612
A messenger is waiting here for him

312
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,647
Don't forget, give it to Har Cha.

313
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:10,400
Where is the messenger?

314
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:11,906
He has gone to sleep

315
00:40:12,043 --> 00:40:14,534
Had dinner and went to sleep.

316
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:18,915
Which room is he staying in?

317
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:23,077
The first one, just up the stair

318
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:47,904
Sir, sir

319
00:40:59,524 --> 00:41:00,821
Come on.

320
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:07,145
What are you doing?

321
00:43:09,287 --> 00:43:11,448
Go and see if General Har has returned.

322
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:16,192
He hasn't come back yet.

323
00:43:23,501 --> 00:43:24,991
Who are you?

324
00:43:25,136 --> 00:43:26,569
A messenger

325
00:43:29,207 --> 00:43:34,543
You're the one who killed General Hung.

326
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:36,408
It'll be your turn soon

327
00:43:36,547 --> 00:43:40,210
I'm here to borrow something from you.

328
00:43:42,386 --> 00:43:44,581
I want to marry without a dowry.

329
00:43:47,558 --> 00:43:50,959
You... What do you want?

330
00:43:52,163 --> 00:43:53,755
Let's talk.

331
00:44:03,007 --> 00:44:07,637
They asked for... your head.

332
00:45:31,429 --> 00:45:35,798
General Wan Yan,
please cooperate.

333
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:37,992
Lend me your head.

334
00:45:38,636 --> 00:45:39,762
Hold!

335
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:46,171
Na sha!

336
00:45:48,212 --> 00:45:50,271
It's me!

337
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:07,427
Look here!

338
00:46:32,156 --> 00:46:33,623
Thank you, Master

339
00:46:34,425 --> 00:46:35,949
After him!

340
00:46:37,662 --> 00:46:41,496
He's hurt.
He can't run far.

341
00:47:47,264 --> 00:47:53,225
Dad, please bless us in heaven

342
00:48:00,344 --> 00:48:04,678
Uncle Wang, how many days has Jin Shan-Kuo been gone?

343
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:07,648
Today is the seventh day.

344
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:10,616
Why is there no news at all?

345
00:48:10,755 --> 00:48:12,086
Did he escape?

346
00:48:12,223 --> 00:48:13,383
I'm more anxious than you.

347
00:48:13,524 --> 00:48:16,254
I've sent someone to town for news.

348
00:48:18,863 --> 00:48:21,354
My lady, Mr. Jin...

349
00:48:21,499 --> 00:48:25,325
- What happened?
- He, he was killed by that Na Sha.

350
00:48:25,469 --> 00:48:27,596
Did someone see it with their own eyes?

351
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:30,036
Is it true?

352
00:48:31,776 --> 00:48:34,574
The news came from Jin's army camp.

353
00:48:34,712 --> 00:48:37,476
Jin Shan-Kuo killed Hung Tu on the way.

354
00:48:37,615 --> 00:48:40,482
Then a person broke into Wan Yan's tent late at night.

355
00:48:40,618 --> 00:48:42,017
He was almost successful

356
00:48:42,153 --> 00:48:45,452
But he was hit in the vital
point by the Blood Sand Palm.

357
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:52,756
He is indeed a brave warrior.

358
00:48:52,897 --> 00:48:55,593
It happened last night.

359
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:57,594
He might have died on the way back.

360
00:49:09,313 --> 00:49:15,741
Dad, tell me.
Who else can I ask?

361
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:23,252
Let's not give up,
there is still a glimmer of hope.

362
00:49:23,394 --> 00:49:25,794
I heard that Lu Ba is
causing trouble at Wuli Peak.

363
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:27,227
I'll call on him

364
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:30,891
Many knights have gone solo,

365
00:49:31,035 --> 00:49:33,469
We should make contact with them

366
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:25,553
Since he is an old hero, please let him in.

367
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:27,088
Certainly.

368
00:50:34,098 --> 00:50:38,967
Miss Zhang, you don't know me.

369
00:50:39,403 --> 00:50:41,371
I've been looking for you for a long time.

370
00:50:41,505 --> 00:50:44,906
May I ask for the name of the heroic guest?

371
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:50,439
Under General Wan Yan,
there are four great generals.

372
00:50:50,581 --> 00:50:52,412
I am Ghost Shadow Fan Tong.

373
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:55,116
Kill him

374
00:52:47,665 --> 00:52:51,726
Anyone dares to make a move,
I won't spare her.

375
00:52:56,273 --> 00:53:01,438
My lady, tell them stand aside

376
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:20,247
Who are you? Tell him to let me through.

377
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:23,155
I'm a messenger.

378
00:54:30,367 --> 00:54:31,834
Attack!

379
00:56:23,847 --> 00:56:25,405
Has he still fever?

380
00:56:26,116 --> 00:56:27,413
No.

381
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:30,118
Hasn't he woken up yet?

382
00:56:39,596 --> 00:56:41,496
It's not too hot, you can feed him.

383
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:56,671
He's is sweating a lot,
he probably won't die.

384
00:57:00,217 --> 00:57:06,622
It's not that I can't die,
it's that I don't want to die.

385
00:57:06,757 --> 00:57:08,452
You're awake!

386
00:57:26,543 --> 00:57:28,636
I can't bear to die.

387
00:57:30,614 --> 00:57:33,879
You almost couldn't marry your wife.

388
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:36,542
You've been unconscious
for three days and three nights.

389
00:57:36,687 --> 00:57:38,678
I will have words with Wang Feng.

390
00:57:39,356 --> 00:57:42,291
He did not warn me that

391
00:57:42,426 --> 00:57:44,394
Na sha has Blood Sand Palm technique.

392
00:57:45,262 --> 00:57:47,822
Well, where is Wang Feng?

393
00:58:10,454 --> 00:58:12,445
General Wang has arrived.

394
00:58:20,597 --> 00:58:23,725
Wang Feng, did the wind blow you here?

395
00:58:27,037 --> 00:58:28,334
General Wang

396
00:58:28,472 --> 00:58:29,837
General Wang

397
00:58:30,874 --> 00:58:33,035
General Wang

398
00:58:35,412 --> 00:58:36,401
General Pang

399
00:58:36,546 --> 00:58:38,207
Don't call me General Pang

400
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:40,441
I'm the Mountain King now.

401
00:58:40,584 --> 00:58:42,449
Just call me Pang Ba.

402
00:58:52,729 --> 00:58:56,187
What about it, do you want to join us?

403
00:58:56,333 --> 00:58:57,527
General Pang

404
00:58:58,802 --> 00:59:01,532
I told you not to call me General Pang.

405
00:59:01,671 --> 00:59:05,198
In my mind, you will always be a
general of the Great Song Dynasty.

406
00:59:05,342 --> 00:59:08,072
Although you are a defeated general.

407
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:10,145
You should not forget
where you came from.

408
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:14,216
Don't talk about that.
It is just upsetting.

409
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:17,677
What exactly are you here for?

410
00:59:17,821 --> 00:59:19,220
I want to ask you to join us

411
00:59:19,356 --> 00:59:23,315
Raise the banner of the people again,
let's fight side by side.

412
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:25,018
You only have one arm left.

413
00:59:25,162 --> 00:59:27,426
What's the point of talking
about fighting or not fighting?

414
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:29,259
They can cut me to pieces,

415
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:31,060
I'll never give up

416
00:59:31,201 --> 00:59:34,637
The General's daughter is
gathering people at Lu Zhuang.

417
00:59:34,771 --> 00:59:36,636
Preparing to fight the Jin army.

418
00:59:36,773 --> 00:59:38,968
General Pang, for Song Dynasty

419
00:59:39,109 --> 00:59:41,942
Lead your troops down the mountain.

420
00:59:44,047 --> 00:59:47,141
You ask them, who will go with you

421
00:59:49,686 --> 00:59:50,846
Gentlemen,

422
00:59:50,987 --> 00:59:55,185
Are you happy to become bandits
and be despised for thousands of years?

423
01:00:01,898 --> 01:00:05,425
General Pang

424
01:00:06,303 --> 01:00:07,930
Who called me General?

425
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:16,177
Don't come here to sow discord.

426
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:20,309
If you're willing to stay,
we'll take you in.

427
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:23,317
If not, get out of here right now.

428
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:26,115
Pang Ba, it's not shameful to be defeated.

429
01:00:26,256 --> 01:00:29,453
What's shameful is that you've
become scared of the Jin army.

430
01:00:33,430 --> 01:00:35,955
Wang Feng,
if you talk like that again...

431
01:00:36,099 --> 01:00:38,693
I shall take your other arm!

432
01:01:45,969 --> 01:01:49,632
Hurry up and put on your
clothes, don't catch a cold.

433
01:01:52,142 --> 01:01:53,632
Is the lady sleeping?

434
01:01:56,413 --> 01:01:59,041
You're always thinking about her.

435
01:02:03,887 --> 01:02:06,447
Jin Shan-Yao, don't dream the impossible.

436
01:02:06,590 --> 01:02:09,286
You must know you're no match.

437
01:02:09,993 --> 01:02:12,518
But she personally promised me.

438
01:02:12,662 --> 01:02:15,028
Why do you have to marry her?

439
01:02:15,165 --> 01:02:18,726
Is it just for revenge?

440
01:02:19,703 --> 01:02:21,534
You have to admit

441
01:02:21,671 --> 01:02:26,404
Your lady is beautiful

442
01:02:29,512 --> 01:02:32,140
But she doesn't like you at all.

443
01:02:32,282 --> 01:02:35,410
I don't care, I want her.

444
01:02:42,392 --> 01:02:45,418
Choosing a wife is a lifelong matter.

445
01:02:45,562 --> 01:02:48,292
You should marry a girl who is your match.

446
01:02:49,032 --> 01:02:53,230
The most important thing is that she likes you.

447
01:02:54,337 --> 01:02:56,032
I've always been disliked by people.

448
01:02:56,172 --> 01:02:58,163
No one has ever liked me.

449
01:02:58,308 --> 01:03:01,505
At first, I disliked you greatly.

450
01:03:01,645 --> 01:03:04,944
But slowly, I stopped disliking you.

451
01:03:06,583 --> 01:03:10,144
It seems like you never look at me directly.

452
01:03:10,954 --> 01:03:13,081
Take a closer look.

453
01:03:19,496 --> 01:03:22,260
I have a bad habit.

454
01:03:22,399 --> 01:03:26,199
I'm not sure to like someone who likes me,

455
01:03:26,336 --> 01:03:31,672
but I must like someone who doesn't like me.

456
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:37,004
You'll never be able to have her in your life.

457
01:03:38,915 --> 01:03:42,282
Why didn't that Na Sha kill you

458
01:03:45,322 --> 01:03:48,849
Don’t' go yet.
I need your help with something.

459
01:03:56,199 --> 01:03:59,691
I asked you to look at me before.

460
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:01,701
Why are you staring at me now?

461
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:04,102
This is my bad habit.

462
01:04:22,459 --> 01:04:24,051
You're here again.

463
01:04:30,567 --> 01:04:33,365
We are doomed to meet each other.

464
01:04:33,503 --> 01:04:36,563
How's your nose? Is it better?

465
01:04:42,746 --> 01:04:44,179
Can you go to another place?

466
01:04:44,314 --> 01:04:47,112
Look, my business is ruined.

467
01:04:48,318 --> 01:04:54,416
No problem, only if someone trouble me

468
01:04:56,226 --> 01:04:58,786
Even if it's a little,
it's still business, right?

469
01:04:58,928 --> 01:05:01,624
Come on, give me two jugs of wine

470
01:05:10,473 --> 01:05:11,098
He didn't die?

471
01:05:11,241 --> 01:05:12,799
That's right.

472
01:05:19,783 --> 01:05:21,273
Did you see it with your own eyes?

473
01:05:21,418 --> 01:05:25,081
I saw him with my own eyes.
He's drinking in the restaurant.

474
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:29,990
This time, I'll make sure he dies.

475
01:05:30,126 --> 01:05:32,151
Master, should I report to the General?

476
01:05:32,295 --> 01:05:34,229
Get some more men to go with you

477
01:05:38,435 --> 01:05:41,959
Unnecessary.
They'll only make trouble.

478
01:06:10,366 --> 01:06:13,392
We've been here for a while,
shouldn't they be here by now?

479
01:06:28,151 --> 01:06:30,119
Master, I've missed you these days.

480
01:06:30,253 --> 01:06:32,187
I was just about to visit you.

481
01:06:33,923 --> 01:06:35,185
Leave.

482
01:06:36,726 --> 01:06:38,284
Please have a seat.

483
01:06:42,866 --> 01:06:48,395
Probably haven't been close
to a woman in your whole life.

484
01:06:49,739 --> 01:06:52,731
But you can always have a little wine!

485
01:06:58,114 --> 01:07:01,015
Trivial tricks, don't show off in front of me.

486
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:03,584
I've been wanting to test you,
go ahead and do your best.

487
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:08,419
I dare not,
I've come to learn your Blood Sand Palm.

488
01:07:09,893 --> 01:07:12,623
No wonder you've recovered so quickly.

489
01:07:12,762 --> 01:07:15,253
Your internal strength is not bad.

490
01:07:16,266 --> 01:07:19,724
Sit down, I have something to tell you.

491
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:21,632
Then talk right now

492
01:07:21,771 --> 01:07:24,831
I've never encountered a
worthy opponent in my life.

493
01:07:24,974 --> 01:07:29,070
Being able to spar with you today,
I feel it's worth it.

494
01:07:30,446 --> 01:07:33,347
However, don't plan on leaving here alive.

495
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:37,285
I came here with no intention of staying alive.

496
01:07:39,322 --> 01:07:41,017
Show me your palm.

497
01:07:44,027 --> 01:07:47,428
I'll let you die without any regrets.

498
01:08:16,025 --> 01:08:17,515
Kill him!

499
01:08:25,068 --> 01:08:26,365
Your turn, girl.

500
01:09:09,379 --> 01:09:13,110
You don't touch women,
but I'm getting married.

501
01:09:34,804 --> 01:09:36,294
Na Sha

502
01:10:06,569 --> 01:10:09,003
We have eliminated three
of the Four Heavenly Kings.

503
01:10:09,138 --> 01:10:12,972
But there are still thousands of
people under Wan Yan Zheng.

504
01:10:13,109 --> 01:10:16,636
With just us, we can't risk launching an attack.

505
01:10:18,681 --> 01:10:21,206
How many people are there under Pang?

506
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:23,477
From what I know, there are about a hundred people.

507
01:10:23,619 --> 01:10:26,952
Most of them tend toward us except Pang.

508
01:10:27,090 --> 01:10:30,253
Uncle Wang, I want to meet General Pang.

509
01:10:30,393 --> 01:10:32,258
My lady

510
01:10:36,966 --> 01:10:41,266
Even if I go, I might not be able to persuade him.

511
01:10:41,404 --> 01:10:45,704
But everyone is shedding blood and sweat.

512
01:10:45,842 --> 01:10:50,245
I may not have martial arts skills,
but I should contribute my part.

513
01:11:15,505 --> 01:11:17,803
Is Wuli Peak ahead?

514
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:19,669
Probably!

515
01:11:26,349 --> 01:11:28,078
Hey, you're guarding the lady,

516
01:11:28,217 --> 01:11:29,684
I'll go ahead to scout.

517
01:11:29,819 --> 01:11:32,652
No point riding into a volley of arrows.

518
01:11:44,167 --> 01:11:46,192
Would you like to take a rest?

519
01:12:25,942 --> 01:12:28,103
How should I address you?

520
01:12:30,446 --> 01:12:35,076
Call me whatever you want

521
01:12:35,218 --> 01:12:37,686
I've wanted to thank you for a long time

522
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:43,786
Regardless of your intentions
or what your purpose is

523
01:12:43,926 --> 01:12:46,190
I'm very grateful to you

524
01:12:46,796 --> 01:12:51,790
You're not marrying me just to
get revenge on my father, are you?

525
01:13:00,176 --> 01:13:03,873
If that's the case,
you'll live your life in hatred

526
01:13:23,065 --> 01:13:25,932
I hope you won't.

527
01:13:26,068 --> 01:13:29,834
I'm willing to repay you for the rest of my life

528
01:13:51,460 --> 01:13:53,587
This mountain is mine

529
01:13:53,896 --> 01:13:56,956
Those trees were planted by me

530
01:13:57,099 --> 01:13:58,691
This mountain doesn't concern you

531
01:13:58,834 --> 01:14:00,426
Those trees were not planted by you

532
01:14:00,569 --> 01:14:03,094
General Gan, do you know me?

533
01:14:11,013 --> 01:14:12,275
Lady

534
01:14:29,065 --> 01:14:32,228
Surprising to see you here, lady

535
01:14:32,368 --> 01:14:35,030
But I can't go back

536
01:14:35,171 --> 01:14:36,536
I have no face to go back

537
01:14:36,672 --> 01:14:39,607
General Pang, we need you

538
01:14:39,742 --> 01:14:42,734
I know I know, I understand

539
01:14:42,878 --> 01:14:47,315
The Jin army is trying to capture me,
they want my head.

540
01:14:47,450 --> 01:14:50,647
Song regards me as a rebel.

541
01:14:50,786 --> 01:14:53,721
Even if I go back, what then?

542
01:14:53,856 --> 01:14:55,576
You can redeem yourself
through your achievements

543
01:14:55,624 --> 01:14:57,683
Drive the Jin army out of the border

544
01:14:57,827 --> 01:15:00,125
You will be a hero of the country

545
01:15:00,262 --> 01:15:03,595
I'm not brave enough.
How many soldiers do you have?

546
01:15:03,733 --> 01:15:05,826
I only have about a hundred people here

547
01:15:05,968 --> 01:15:10,268
Can you take on thousands
of Jin soldiers in battle?

548
01:15:10,406 --> 01:15:11,964
You!

549
01:15:13,009 --> 01:15:16,536
Wang Feng is right about your being scared.

550
01:15:16,679 --> 01:15:18,112
You...!

551
01:15:58,788 --> 01:16:01,348
So this a great general of the Song Dynasty?

552
01:16:05,494 --> 01:16:06,586
Shan-Kuo!

553
01:17:03,652 --> 01:17:07,679
Enemies roam freely in our land,
and I can do nothing.

554
01:17:07,823 --> 01:17:09,916
I can only do what heroes do.

555
01:17:10,059 --> 01:17:12,391
Offer my head to the enemy.

556
01:17:12,528 --> 01:17:14,553
Take the opportunity to kill Wang Yan.

557
01:17:14,697 --> 01:17:18,531
For our country's sake,
to avenge General Zhang.

558
01:17:18,667 --> 01:17:21,465
Even if I, Pang Ba, die, I have no regrets.

559
01:17:21,604 --> 01:17:24,164
Pang Ba's final words.

560
01:17:34,783 --> 01:17:40,483
An extraordinary general, a great hero.

561
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:01,438
Sure! It's Pang Pa

562
01:18:05,281 --> 01:18:07,181
Still not ready to die, Chang?

563
01:18:07,316 --> 01:18:10,479
I killed him with my own hands,
so there's no mistake.

564
01:18:19,795 --> 01:18:22,958
You finally know what's good for you.

565
01:18:28,204 --> 01:18:32,937
Thanks to master's blessings,
I hope I can secure a good position.

566
01:18:33,842 --> 01:18:36,037
You won't be disappointed.

567
01:18:36,946 --> 01:18:40,109
If all the people of the Song Dynasty were like you,

568
01:18:40,249 --> 01:18:43,275
we would already rule your country.

569
01:18:50,526 --> 01:18:53,791
Is Miss Zhang at Lu Zhuang?

570
01:18:53,929 --> 01:18:57,228
If the master doesn't believe it,
I can show you the way.

571
01:18:58,300 --> 01:18:59,824
How many are there?

572
01:19:03,973 --> 01:19:06,567
There are probably about twenty men and women.

573
01:19:06,709 --> 01:19:10,008
Is there a man called...

574
01:19:12,481 --> 01:19:13,381
Well, what's his name?

575
01:19:13,515 --> 01:19:14,880
The messenger.

576
01:19:15,017 --> 01:19:17,542
Right, the one called messenger?

577
01:19:17,686 --> 01:19:19,449
I never heard of any messenger

578
01:19:19,588 --> 01:19:23,547
Lu Da Kang is the strongest one there.

579
01:19:23,692 --> 01:19:26,889
Pang Ba, you, who else is left?

580
01:19:27,029 --> 01:19:29,827
What's so special about Lu Dagang?

581
01:19:32,234 --> 01:19:35,362
Don't let them slip away.
Let's go now.

582
01:19:39,408 --> 01:19:44,311
Wang Feng, you lead the way.

583
01:20:05,601 --> 01:20:07,967
It seems like there's no one in this village.

584
01:20:09,004 --> 01:20:10,869
Burn it when we come back.

585
01:20:23,786 --> 01:20:25,481
Climb to the tower.

586
01:21:03,192 --> 01:21:06,093
General, they're hiding in this temple.

587
01:22:19,301 --> 01:22:22,862
General, this is the person you're looking for.

588
01:22:31,547 --> 01:22:35,779
Yes, yes, yes, it's her.

589
01:22:36,084 --> 01:22:41,249
Look, she's more beautiful than a painting.

590
01:22:50,532 --> 01:22:52,193
Wang Feng...

591
01:23:34,510 --> 01:23:41,245
Little lady, take this.

592
01:24:59,094 --> 01:25:00,618
Fight!

593
01:27:00,515 --> 01:27:02,415
Fight!

594
01:27:53,668 --> 01:27:55,329
Beauty.

595
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:05,041
Beautiful.

596
01:28:17,893 --> 01:28:19,417
Beautiful.

597
01:28:24,366 --> 01:28:27,893
Beautiful, beautiful...

598
01:28:29,538 --> 01:28:34,498
Prettier than a painting

599
01:29:52,721 --> 01:29:54,655
Dad!

600
01:30:13,909 --> 01:30:17,208
General Wang, where is Jin Shan-Kuo

601
01:30:40,802 --> 01:30:42,702
My lady...

602
01:30:53,248 --> 01:30:56,217
Miss, Jin Shan-Kuo...

603
01:31:01,156 --> 01:31:02,487
Lady...

604
01:31:03,959 --> 01:31:06,223
Jin Shan-Kuo wants you to take care.

605
01:31:06,728 --> 01:31:07,752
Where is he?

606
01:31:07,896 --> 01:31:09,557
He is gone!
