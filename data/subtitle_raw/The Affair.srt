2
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:50,117
<i>It knows us,
this place.</i>

3
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,221
<i>Our young friend</i>

4
00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:56,524
<i>watching as we grow old.</i>

5
00:00:57,324 --> 00:00:58,760
<i>A mirror to our years.</i>

6
00:01:02,797 --> 00:01:03,798
<i>Pulling us back.</i>

7
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,703
<i>Our center, our gravity.</i>

8
00:02:48,803 --> 00:02:50,237
Thank you, sir.

9
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:55,543
We have three days
to get to Milan.

10
00:02:55,576 --> 00:02:57,812
We can take as long
as we like, can't we?

11
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,246
I'm afraid not.

12
00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:02,449
We have an appointment.

13
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:04,484
What do you mean?

14
00:03:05,553 --> 00:03:07,421
What kind of appointment?

15
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:08,556
Surprise.

16
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:13,293
Consider it
your wedding present.

17
00:04:06,714 --> 00:04:09,249
- Excited? Me, too.
- Yes!

18
00:04:14,589 --> 00:04:15,690
Thank you.

19
00:04:23,497 --> 00:04:27,001
Aren't you worried that your
modern houses will spoil the landscape?

20
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:35,543
Viktor, we know this.

21
00:04:35,576 --> 00:04:36,944
Mr. von Abt's in Stuttgart.

22
00:04:39,914 --> 00:04:43,684
- Could I have an autograph, please?
- Of course.

23
00:04:43,718 --> 00:04:47,989
Thank you, <i>Herr</i> von Abt.
We find your modern designs quite amazing.

24
00:04:48,022 --> 00:04:49,356
There you go.

25
00:04:58,766 --> 00:04:59,767
So,

26
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:03,638
<i>Frau</i> Landauer,

27
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:05,706
your husband tells me
you're in need of a house.

28
00:05:11,078 --> 00:05:12,547
What did you have in mind?

29
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:15,482
Something like this?

30
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:18,619
Not exactly.

31
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:22,857
Why not?

32
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,393
- It's a wonderful room.
- Yes.

33
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:29,329
But of its time.

34
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:35,503
Two rich, young newlyweds.

35
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:38,706
Why should I bother?

36
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:42,375
Are the poor and elderly queuing
up for your services, <i>Herr</i> von Abt?

37
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:44,444
You will have the funds
you need,

38
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:46,013
and the chance
to do your best work.

39
00:05:53,654 --> 00:05:55,756
The site is a problem.

40
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,124
- The slope.
- Yes.

41
00:05:57,158 --> 00:05:59,961
But the slope gives height.
It faces south.

42
00:05:59,994 --> 00:06:03,130
And the view of the city,
it's wonderful.

43
00:06:03,164 --> 00:06:04,732
What do you want
from this building?

44
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:09,604
Simplicity,

45
00:06:11,072 --> 00:06:12,073
clarity,

46
00:06:14,008 --> 00:06:15,009
light.

47
00:06:15,843 --> 00:06:17,645
A home true to the age.

48
00:06:20,014 --> 00:06:23,618
And are you true to the age,
<i>Frau</i> Landauer?

49
00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:25,820
It's not so easy.

50
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:31,525
We're pulled to the future,
but yearn for the past.

51
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:32,894
The cave, the darkness.

52
00:06:34,195 --> 00:06:35,796
Are you ready
to live in the light?

53
00:07:26,948 --> 00:07:28,816
I once had a Landauer, Viktor.

54
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:30,483
The best car you ever made.

55
00:07:30,518 --> 00:07:32,820
I adored it. A '45.

56
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:34,789
- The Torpedo?
- Yes.

57
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:36,958
Well,

58
00:07:36,991 --> 00:07:39,660
I'm afraid I aimed it at a bus
that sank us both.

59
00:07:41,162 --> 00:07:43,731
Don't you have something
to show us, <i>Herr</i> von Abt?

60
00:07:43,764 --> 00:07:45,766
Poor Liesel looks
faint with anticipation.

61
00:07:46,801 --> 00:07:48,002
Indeed.

62
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,572
I'm a builder.

63
00:07:51,605 --> 00:07:54,842
I deal with physical problems.
Not in style or form.

64
00:07:55,376 --> 00:07:57,278
Form is not the goal.

65
00:07:57,311 --> 00:08:00,014
It's the manner in which
a problem is addressed.

66
00:08:03,985 --> 00:08:05,152
So...

67
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:09,890
From the street.

68
00:08:11,292 --> 00:08:14,061
A single story. Low, discrete.

69
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:20,167
The servant's quarters
behind the garage, here.

70
00:08:20,201 --> 00:08:23,204
And here, an opening
a glimpse of the city.

71
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,609
We enter not at the bottom,
but at the top.

72
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:31,946
There are bedrooms, bathrooms.

73
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:34,682
The hallway
encased in frosted glass.

74
00:08:34,715 --> 00:08:37,985
And the staircase,
down to the heart of the house.

75
00:08:45,126 --> 00:08:46,227
A single space,

76
00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:49,263
large.

77
00:08:49,296 --> 00:08:52,733
Areas to talk, to eat,
to be alone.

78
00:08:52,767 --> 00:08:55,970
Each one separate,
and yet joined.

79
00:08:56,003 --> 00:08:58,739
Part of the whole.
Glass and steel.

80
00:08:58,773 --> 00:09:00,007
Skin and bone.

81
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:02,843
Walls melt into air,
into trees and sky.

82
00:09:04,011 --> 00:09:05,579
It lets us move.

83
00:09:05,613 --> 00:09:07,048
It changes as you walk.

84
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:08,582
It will take the breath away.

85
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:12,987
There is more.

86
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:26,300
I talk about the weather.
I ask about their holidays.

87
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:29,703
As little as possible about
the work they pay for.

88
00:09:29,737 --> 00:09:31,038
That's my rule.

89
00:09:31,072 --> 00:09:33,908
You, Liesel, are the exception.

90
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:35,609
Because you know what you want.

91
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:40,114
And now

92
00:09:40,147 --> 00:09:42,983
we are in a race to see who
will be first to give birth.

93
00:09:45,219 --> 00:09:47,054
I think we know
who's going to win.

94
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:49,190
It's as it should be.

95
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:51,358
You'll be a family.

96
00:09:51,392 --> 00:09:53,160
Hmm.

97
00:09:53,194 --> 00:09:54,695
You'll bring the house alive.

98
00:10:00,401 --> 00:10:02,736
A family's an
interesting problem.

99
00:10:03,704 --> 00:10:04,705
And why is that?

100
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:10,277
We aim for clarity,
transparency.

101
00:10:11,312 --> 00:10:13,214
Freedom from compromise.

102
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:17,351
Can we construct
a family through that design?

103
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,855
Can we still have what we want?

104
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,861
Come to my room.

105
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:30,030
Rainer!

106
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:34,768
Forgive me. Uh...

107
00:10:36,704 --> 00:10:38,672
As I say,
an interesting problem.

108
00:10:39,707 --> 00:10:41,342
Not one that can be solved.

109
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:03,864
<i>Are you in love
with him?</i>

110
00:11:04,365 --> 00:11:05,966
With Rainer?

111
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,403
For heaven's sake.

112
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:12,806
Hana, I've only been married
five minutes.

113
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,108
So?

114
00:11:14,141 --> 00:11:16,977
And look at me.
I'm like a whale.

115
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:18,345
No!

116
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,915
You're divine.

117
00:11:20,948 --> 00:11:22,683
I've never seen
you more beautiful.

118
00:11:25,052 --> 00:11:26,854
He kicks like a horse.

119
00:11:27,955 --> 00:11:30,424
- He?
- Or she. Maybe she.

120
00:11:33,127 --> 00:11:34,228
Shall we find out?

121
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,213
Back and forth for a boy.

122
00:11:53,214 --> 00:11:54,848
Round and round for a girl.

123
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:10,497
My God, look at you.

124
00:12:15,236 --> 00:12:16,237
Can I touch it?

125
00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:21,075
If you really want to.

126
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:28,275
Your architect wrote to me.

127
00:13:30,344 --> 00:13:32,446
He wants to take me to dinner
the next time he's here.

128
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:35,215
Do you mind?

129
00:13:37,384 --> 00:13:38,419
Why should I mind?

130
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:54,536
The glass is superb,
isn't it?

131
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:57,338
Almost nothing.

132
00:13:57,371 --> 00:14:00,040
Quite the opposite,
it's everything.

133
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:06,914
- Liesel, it's beautiful.
- Thank you. We're very happy.

134
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:14,221
And what does my little
Otilie think of this?

135
00:14:14,254 --> 00:14:15,989
I don't like the look of this.

136
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:20,127
There is water on the terrace.

137
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,198
I promise you that the
terrace and roof are waterproof.

138
00:14:24,231 --> 00:14:27,101
But we can add a pitch too,
if you like.

139
00:14:27,134 --> 00:14:30,270
- Couple of towers and a...
- I made him bring me.

140
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:33,140
Please, don't be angry.

141
00:14:33,173 --> 00:14:34,642
I would hate
to spoil this for you.

142
00:14:36,276 --> 00:14:37,277
Ladies!

143
00:14:46,654 --> 00:14:50,525
The ebony for the curved partition
is already in the workshop.

144
00:14:50,558 --> 00:14:52,159
For the second partition,

145
00:14:53,561 --> 00:14:55,262
I have a proposal.

146
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,264
It's gorgeous!

147
00:14:58,098 --> 00:14:59,133
What is it?

148
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:02,136
Onyx. From the Atlas Mountains.

149
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:05,640
Mmm-hmm. How much?
- Look, Viktor,

150
00:15:05,673 --> 00:15:07,509
the veins, the color.

151
00:15:07,542 --> 00:15:09,309
Like something alive.

152
00:15:09,343 --> 00:15:12,680
And when the sun sets,
it'll glow red, like a flame.

153
00:15:12,714 --> 00:15:14,214
The beating heart of your home.

154
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:16,250
- How much?
- $15,000.

155
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:19,153
You're insane.

156
00:15:19,186 --> 00:15:21,656
You can buy an entire
house for $15,000.

157
00:15:23,123 --> 00:15:24,559
Viktor, I know it's a lot.

158
00:15:24,592 --> 00:15:27,494
Liesel! People are
already talking about it.

159
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:30,264
- Our extravagance.
- Let them!

160
00:15:30,297 --> 00:15:32,366
Rainer's built
something extraordinary.

161
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,702
Something that will
outlast all of us.

162
00:15:36,403 --> 00:15:37,705
Let him finish his work.

163
00:15:53,086 --> 00:15:55,222
You're in
<i>Die Bildung</i> again.

164
00:15:55,255 --> 00:15:58,091
Critics adore its fewer lines
and austere harmony,

165
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:02,463
but what kind of life is possible in
<i>Herr</i> von Abt's modernist masterpiece?

166
00:16:02,496 --> 00:16:05,667
Bloody cheek.

167
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,235
How do you and your brother
like it, Mrs. Lanikova,

168
00:16:08,268 --> 00:16:12,707
- to live in a masterpiece?
- Very pleasant, thank you.

169
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:15,175
As long as I don't have
to wash the windows.

170
00:16:16,443 --> 00:16:18,445
- Should I take her up?
- Thank you.

171
00:16:18,479 --> 00:16:19,980
Excuse me.

172
00:16:36,063 --> 00:16:39,166
- Have you seen him?
- No.

173
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:43,270
Have you forgiven me?

174
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:47,709
He talked about you
incessantly, by the way.

175
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:51,144
When he wasn't
talking about himself.

176
00:16:53,113 --> 00:16:56,618
He turned out to be
surprisingly dull.

177
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,329
- I hate being cross with you.
- I know.

178
00:17:11,298 --> 00:17:12,734
But I probably deserved it.

179
00:17:14,301 --> 00:17:15,469
I think I'm pregnant.

180
00:17:17,705 --> 00:17:18,740
My God! Really?

181
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:24,478
- And are you pleased?
- Of course.

182
00:17:25,847 --> 00:17:28,348
It's just rather soon.

183
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,452
Well, you do
make it look terribly easy.

184
00:17:35,623 --> 00:17:37,625
It's not that easy
for everyone, you know.

185
00:17:46,668 --> 00:17:48,770
We tried and tried and tried...

186
00:17:52,774 --> 00:17:54,074
But it seems I just...

187
00:17:57,277 --> 00:17:58,546
I just can't have children.

188
00:18:00,548 --> 00:18:01,549
Hana,

189
00:18:03,751 --> 00:18:05,185
I had no idea.

190
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:06,521
You think it
would be a disaster.

191
00:18:06,554 --> 00:18:07,755
No, no!

192
00:18:09,222 --> 00:18:10,457
You should have said something.

193
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:11,726
You're my best friend.

194
00:18:21,268 --> 00:18:22,402
I know how lucky I am.

195
00:18:31,713 --> 00:18:33,615
And I'm really, really
happy for you.

196
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,686
Promise never to think
that I'm not.

197
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,556
- That I don't love you and your beautiful children.
- No.

198
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:13,621
Martin, it's Marika's turn.

199
00:19:14,889 --> 00:19:17,725
- Watch me, Kata!
- Yes.

200
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:23,765
<i>They left with nothing.
Just got on the first train.</i>

201
00:19:24,632 --> 00:19:25,667
Things she saw.

202
00:19:26,734 --> 00:19:29,804
The kosher butcher on the street
had his throat cut.

203
00:19:29,837 --> 00:19:33,508
Beatings. Old men made
to scrub the pavements.

204
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:37,277
But there are thousands of them.

205
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:39,647
Aren't you scared?

206
00:19:40,447 --> 00:19:41,516
It won't happen here.

207
00:19:44,585 --> 00:19:46,587
But, what if it does?

208
00:19:49,524 --> 00:19:51,592
Liesel, we are both
married to Jews.

209
00:19:51,626 --> 00:19:53,561
It's happening
50 kilometers away.

210
00:19:57,397 --> 00:19:58,533
Bring the fish, will you?

211
00:20:02,837 --> 00:20:05,540
I sometimes go like this.

212
00:20:10,745 --> 00:20:12,980
I used
to look at all this

213
00:20:13,014 --> 00:20:15,516
and imagine everything
out there was calm.

214
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:22,422
Shall we? Three copies.

215
00:20:22,456 --> 00:20:25,827
Transferring ownership of the
firm to your father-in-law.

216
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:29,897
It's a formality,
but a sensible one.

217
00:20:32,033 --> 00:20:35,402
And I've spoken to Bohmer.
He's transferring funds to Zurich.

218
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:40,608
Do you know when you will go?

219
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:43,410
I still hope we won't have to.

220
00:20:46,013 --> 00:20:49,416
The tricky part will be knowing
the moment when it comes.

221
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:52,019
The tricky part will be
persuading my wife.

222
00:20:53,386 --> 00:20:54,989
She refuses to discuss it.

223
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:10,905
She's rather lovely, isn't she?

224
00:21:13,674 --> 00:21:16,309
- I'm hungry.
- Let's go!

225
00:21:17,044 --> 00:21:18,546
There you go.

226
00:21:18,579 --> 00:21:20,081
- It looks very nice
- What about this?

227
00:21:20,114 --> 00:21:22,650
No, it's lunch.
Now is not the time.

228
00:21:22,683 --> 00:21:23,885
You can go out later.

229
00:21:25,753 --> 00:21:27,320
Can you pass me
the food, please?

230
00:21:31,424 --> 00:21:34,695
- Oskar, so annoyed you stayed for lunch.
- My pleasure.

231
00:21:34,729 --> 00:21:35,763
Otilie, stop it.

232
00:21:41,969 --> 00:21:42,970
Come on!

233
00:23:54,936 --> 00:23:56,003
Viktor.

234
00:24:01,742 --> 00:24:03,511
Viktor?

235
00:24:03,544 --> 00:24:06,647
Ah, you, you can't come in,
I'm afraid.

236
00:24:06,681 --> 00:24:09,183
Oh, I didn't know
where you were.

237
00:24:10,117 --> 00:24:11,451
I won't be long.

238
00:24:56,897 --> 00:24:58,032
Where you off to today?

239
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:01,302
A recital at the Philharmonic.

240
00:25:01,335 --> 00:25:03,537
- And then drinks at Hillshire.
- Hillshire.

241
00:25:05,139 --> 00:25:07,208
Of course. Life goes on.

242
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,555
You're taking her away.

243
00:25:22,623 --> 00:25:25,993
Listen, I know how much
you mean to each other.

244
00:25:26,027 --> 00:25:27,194
When do you leave?

245
00:25:29,663 --> 00:25:31,899
We're still in negotiation.
But soon.

246
00:25:32,566 --> 00:25:34,001
What about Kata and the girl?

247
00:25:35,336 --> 00:25:36,537
They'll come with us.

248
00:25:38,706 --> 00:25:40,107
Liesel insists.

249
00:25:42,977 --> 00:25:44,078
There you are.

250
00:25:44,445 --> 00:25:45,646
I'm sorry.

251
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,581
Shall we go?

252
00:25:47,615 --> 00:25:49,316
- Yes.
- I won't be late.

253
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:51,852
I've told Kata I'll pick up
the children on the way back.

254
00:25:51,886 --> 00:25:53,854
Save them trudging
through the snow.

255
00:26:00,261 --> 00:26:02,730
Damn it! I've forgotten
the tickets.

256
00:26:04,265 --> 00:26:06,333
Sorry, Lanik.
we'll have to go back.

257
00:26:07,034 --> 00:26:08,769
Why?

258
00:26:08,803 --> 00:26:10,304
They'll let us in,
we'll explain.

259
00:26:10,337 --> 00:26:11,739
There's plenty of time.

260
00:26:11,772 --> 00:26:13,874
But, <i>Frau</i> Landauer, the snow.

261
00:26:15,376 --> 00:26:17,812
Lanik, please.
I'd like to go back.

262
00:27:54,375 --> 00:27:56,410
- Liesel.
- Not now!

263
00:28:03,484 --> 00:28:05,085
Hey.

264
00:28:06,887 --> 00:28:11,725
It's cold outside, Kata.
Mama says we can have hot chocolate.

265
00:28:12,092 --> 00:28:13,460
Okay.

266
00:28:41,422 --> 00:28:42,423
You came back.

267
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,995
I forgot something.

268
00:28:53,334 --> 00:28:56,437
Does he like it?
That noise you make?

269
00:29:10,184 --> 00:29:12,019
When did it start?

270
00:29:13,588 --> 00:29:14,989
In the summer.

271
00:29:16,156 --> 00:29:17,458
August, I think.

272
00:29:21,895 --> 00:29:23,163
I'm sorry.

273
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:29,403
I... I... I don't understand.

274
00:29:32,339 --> 00:29:35,909
- I tried to be your friend.
- I know.

275
00:29:38,846 --> 00:29:41,248
I gave you a home,
you were safe.

276
00:29:42,283 --> 00:29:44,318
I know. I'm sorry.

277
00:29:44,351 --> 00:29:46,387
Did you feel
some sort of obligation?

278
00:29:47,888 --> 00:29:48,889
No.

279
00:29:54,328 --> 00:29:55,329
I wanted it.

280
00:29:56,497 --> 00:29:57,498
It was wrong.

281
00:29:58,999 --> 00:30:02,202
And I was grateful to you.
So grateful.

282
00:30:03,505 --> 00:30:05,507
But that wasn't all I was.

283
00:30:07,007 --> 00:30:09,043
Your grateful refugee.

284
00:30:10,578 --> 00:30:12,514
It wasn't what I needed.

285
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:24,825
Take Marika.

286
00:30:26,528 --> 00:30:29,396
I beg you. Take her with you.

287
00:30:47,147 --> 00:30:48,516
Did you hear what she said?

288
00:30:51,051 --> 00:30:53,454
She wants us to take Marika
with us when we leave.

289
00:31:01,061 --> 00:31:02,429
What are we going to do?

290
00:31:04,298 --> 00:31:05,432
I don't know.

291
00:31:08,603 --> 00:31:10,204
Coward.

292
00:31:16,511 --> 00:31:19,547
The tickets are picked up.
I won't stay.

293
00:31:24,418 --> 00:31:26,153
He doesn't deserve you.

294
00:31:27,321 --> 00:31:28,590
I know.

295
00:31:30,391 --> 00:31:31,559
But the children, they do.

296
00:31:37,565 --> 00:31:39,534
You can't stay.

297
00:31:39,567 --> 00:31:40,668
You have to persuade him,

298
00:31:40,702 --> 00:31:42,336
- and if you can't, then...
- I will.

299
00:31:44,304 --> 00:31:46,206
We'll come and find you.

300
00:32:59,346 --> 00:33:00,515
I can't.

301
00:33:54,301 --> 00:33:55,335
Take the page.

302
00:34:04,444 --> 00:34:06,113
Fancy them leaving it so late.

303
00:34:06,814 --> 00:34:07,815
Will they let them go?

304
00:34:09,316 --> 00:34:10,484
Of course they will.

305
00:34:11,819 --> 00:34:14,488
It's what they want, isn't it?

306
00:34:14,522 --> 00:34:16,223
They want to get rid of them.

307
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:19,459
He wants this covered up.

308
00:34:19,493 --> 00:34:22,095
Says he doesn't want someone
turning it into ashtrays.

309
00:34:25,465 --> 00:34:28,168
But these are
worth a bit as well.

310
00:34:28,201 --> 00:34:29,469
What if they come back?

311
00:34:37,579 --> 00:34:40,113
They are not coming back.

312
00:34:40,147 --> 00:34:42,784
Miss, I'm sorry.
It's just not enough.

313
00:34:42,817 --> 00:34:44,686
That is perfectly in order.

314
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,621
It was issued
by the League of Nations.

315
00:34:46,654 --> 00:34:48,355
Move along, sir.

316
00:34:48,388 --> 00:34:50,290
- Come on.
- You.

317
00:34:50,324 --> 00:34:53,293
- Wait just a moment.
- Christ, we don't have time for this.

318
00:34:53,327 --> 00:34:55,195
I'll catch you up, Marika.

319
00:34:59,433 --> 00:35:00,702
She's with us.

320
00:35:01,836 --> 00:35:03,370
Come on, Viktor.

321
00:35:39,974 --> 00:35:42,309
- Come on, sir. It's time to go.
- Please. We're waiting for someone.

322
00:35:42,342 --> 00:35:44,812
For Christ's sake,
get on the plane!

323
00:35:45,379 --> 00:35:46,547
Come on!

324
00:35:46,581 --> 00:35:47,582
Viktor!

325
00:35:48,415 --> 00:35:50,450
Halt! Come back!

326
00:35:51,385 --> 00:35:52,754
Leave me!

327
00:35:52,787 --> 00:35:54,922
Someone else is missing.
I have to get her! Leave me!

328
00:36:06,634 --> 00:36:09,269
You'll kill all of us, Viktor!

329
00:36:10,337 --> 00:36:11,572
Why'd you do it?

330
00:36:12,339 --> 00:36:13,340
Get up!

331
00:36:19,312 --> 00:36:20,515
Go!

332
00:36:25,887 --> 00:36:28,388
Where's Marika?

333
00:36:58,786 --> 00:37:01,522
Get in, Martin. Go!

334
00:37:03,958 --> 00:37:06,994
<i>It's a horrible old pile.</i>

335
00:37:07,028 --> 00:37:09,463
<i>But it's on the lake,
and there's a garden.</i>

336
00:37:10,363 --> 00:37:12,767
<i>Children like it.</i>

337
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,402
<i>There's a rowing boat
and skiing in the winter.</i>

338
00:37:16,904 --> 00:37:18,806
<i>If we're still here.</i>

339
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,575
Look, Mama, look!

340
00:37:21,475 --> 00:37:24,779
I can see, darling.
That's very good.

341
00:37:27,615 --> 00:37:29,984
<i>I make it sound like a holiday.</i>

342
00:37:30,017 --> 00:37:32,352
<i>But a holiday
only lasts so long.</i>

343
00:37:34,021 --> 00:37:37,491
<i>And when it ends, you go home.</i>

344
00:37:44,632 --> 00:37:47,267
<i>Viktor spends most of his time
in Zurich.</i>

345
00:37:50,104 --> 00:37:54,374
<i>I gather there are
visits to the German consulate,</i>

346
00:37:54,407 --> 00:37:57,979
<i>and I see letters addressed to
every kind of relief organization</i>

347
00:37:58,012 --> 00:37:59,714
<i>or refugee committee.</i>

348
00:38:03,017 --> 00:38:04,417
<i>He's trying to find her.</i>

349
00:38:06,087 --> 00:38:08,556
<i>I have a feeling
it's all he thinks about.</i>

350
00:38:10,691 --> 00:38:12,894
<i>Of course, the matter is
undiscussed.</i>

351
00:38:14,662 --> 00:38:16,597
<i>What on Earth would I say?</i>

352
00:38:36,617 --> 00:38:39,020
<i>Dear God, I miss you.</i>

353
00:38:40,655 --> 00:38:42,455
<i>Can't you come?</i>

354
00:39:50,825 --> 00:39:52,827
<i>Our accounts are frozen.</i>

355
00:39:54,629 --> 00:39:56,463
<i>They took Oskar's firm
and handed it</i>

356
00:39:56,496 --> 00:39:58,766
<i>to a Sudeten halfwit
called Schneider.</i>

357
00:40:00,601 --> 00:40:02,870
<i>There's a word
for this procedure.</i>

358
00:40:02,904 --> 00:40:04,605
<i>They call it Aryanization.</i>

359
00:40:07,909 --> 00:40:11,145
<i>I must be careful
with what I write.</i>

360
00:40:11,178 --> 00:40:15,549
<i>Things have changed in the
protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia,</i>

361
00:40:15,583 --> 00:40:18,753
<i>this proud and grateful corner
of the German Reich.</i>

362
00:40:48,582 --> 00:40:49,650
What does Hana say?

363
00:40:51,152 --> 00:40:52,452
It's about Kata.

364
00:40:53,888 --> 00:40:55,856
<i>She needed money.</i>

365
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:58,491
<i>Just enough to get her
and Marika to Prague.</i>

366
00:40:58,526 --> 00:41:01,494
<i>They're putting children
on trains to England.</i>

367
00:41:01,529 --> 00:41:04,131
<i>Mothers and fathers are putting
the children onto trains</i>

368
00:41:04,165 --> 00:41:05,566
<i>and waving goodbye.</i>

369
00:41:06,901 --> 00:41:08,202
Can you imagine?

370
00:41:08,235 --> 00:41:10,838
Where is she? Where's Kata?

371
00:41:10,871 --> 00:41:12,907
I don't know. She doesn't say.

372
00:41:47,875 --> 00:41:50,978
<i>I go there in my
dreams, across the hallway,</i>

373
00:41:52,013 --> 00:41:54,315
<i>everything just as it was.</i>

374
00:41:54,348 --> 00:41:57,685
<i>Down the stairs,
12 steps to the turn.</i>

375
00:41:58,986 --> 00:42:00,721
<i>And it's the strangest thing.</i>

376
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:10,564
<i>You are there.</i>

377
00:42:10,931 --> 00:42:13,000
<i>Always.</i>

378
00:42:13,034 --> 00:42:15,202
<i>It's as if I am visiting you.</i>

379
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:21,976
<i>You're there, waiting for me.</i>

380
00:42:22,009 --> 00:42:24,078
<i>Waiting for me
in the classroom.</i>

381
00:42:33,821 --> 00:42:35,122
<i>Are you reading this?</i>

382
00:42:36,891 --> 00:42:38,759
<i>It's months
since your last reply.</i>

383
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:43,097
<i>And still I write, not knowing.</i>

384
00:42:52,173 --> 00:42:53,707
The Landauer house?

385
00:42:56,243 --> 00:42:59,046
I know it very well.
I watched it being built.

386
00:43:00,247 --> 00:43:02,616
Liesel Landauer
was my greatest friend.

387
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:03,818
The house was empty.

388
00:43:04,919 --> 00:43:06,153
I have given it a purpose.

389
00:43:10,091 --> 00:43:11,092
I'm an engineer.

390
00:43:12,226 --> 00:43:15,796
I have a team,
draftsmen and designers.

391
00:43:16,931 --> 00:43:18,599
More than that,
I'm not permitted to say.

392
00:43:29,677 --> 00:43:30,911
<i>They took everything.</i>

393
00:43:31,745 --> 00:43:32,746
<i>The paintings.</i>

394
00:43:33,681 --> 00:43:35,249
<i>The Klee, the Miro.</i>

395
00:43:37,318 --> 00:43:39,987
<i>It was all very polite.</i>

396
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:43,290
<i>One of them was once
a clerk at the firm.</i>

397
00:43:43,324 --> 00:43:45,926
<i>Oskar asked after
his wife and children.</i>

398
00:43:47,094 --> 00:43:49,930
<i>I could have scratched
the little shit's eyes out.</i>

399
00:43:51,132 --> 00:43:52,399
<i>And your gift,</i>

400
00:43:52,433 --> 00:43:53,667
<i>you remember?</i>

401
00:43:54,468 --> 00:43:56,804
<i>I hid it from them. It's safe.</i>

402
00:44:00,241 --> 00:44:02,943
<i>Oskar hasn't left
the apartment in almost a year.</i>

403
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:04,879
<i>He won't.</i>

404
00:44:04,912 --> 00:44:06,647
<i>Not with the star
on his jacket.</i>

405
00:44:12,419 --> 00:44:14,955
<i>But he took good care of me,
didn't he?</i>

406
00:44:14,989 --> 00:44:16,857
<i>For all those years.</i>

407
00:44:16,891 --> 00:44:18,425
<i>Now, I must take care of him.</i>

408
00:44:25,266 --> 00:44:27,735
<i>And so, to my news.</i>

409
00:44:27,768 --> 00:44:31,205
<i>Wherever you are,
whenever you might read this.</i>

410
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:34,008
<i>I've been to the house.</i>

411
00:44:38,279 --> 00:44:40,414
<i>In the company
of its new occupant.</i>

412
00:45:06,207 --> 00:45:07,775
There is more.

413
00:45:08,309 --> 00:45:09,877
No, thank you.

414
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:11,045
It was very good.

415
00:45:34,468 --> 00:45:35,936
This was the children's room.

416
00:45:38,573 --> 00:45:40,074
Do you know their names?

417
00:45:40,841 --> 00:45:42,409
No.

418
00:45:42,443 --> 00:45:43,877
Otilie and Martin.

419
00:46:04,098 --> 00:46:06,367
Am I supposed to feel guilt
for their absence?

420
00:46:08,402 --> 00:46:10,471
You could look
a little embarrassed.

421
00:46:16,477 --> 00:46:18,513
I do my work.

422
00:46:18,546 --> 00:46:20,314
The circumstances
are far from us to choose.

423
00:46:24,351 --> 00:46:25,953
My husband is a Jew.

424
00:46:28,455 --> 00:46:29,557
I know.

425
00:46:35,963 --> 00:46:38,098
The caretaker thought
that I should be told.

426
00:46:42,069 --> 00:46:43,470
Is it good to be back?

427
00:46:47,875 --> 00:46:48,876
It's terrible.

428
00:47:43,497 --> 00:47:45,132
You chose Liesel's room.

429
00:47:48,603 --> 00:47:49,604
Did I?

430
00:50:29,831 --> 00:50:32,432
So this is your work?

431
00:50:32,466 --> 00:50:34,501
- Airplanes?
- You shouldn't be in here.

432
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:37,739
I see what you meant.

433
00:50:40,608 --> 00:50:42,610
It's all very lovely.

434
00:50:42,644 --> 00:50:45,045
One could almost forget
what it's really about.

435
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:47,481
The bombs and the killing.

436
00:50:57,324 --> 00:51:00,127
There are no supporting walls
here, did you know that?

437
00:51:01,763 --> 00:51:03,798
Everything is suspended
from the frame.

438
00:51:05,667 --> 00:51:07,602
I knew the architect.
We were lovers.

439
00:51:09,202 --> 00:51:10,538
My staff will be here soon.

440
00:52:59,847 --> 00:53:01,549
Tell me about your wife.

441
00:53:03,618 --> 00:53:05,285
I don't have a wife.

442
00:53:11,893 --> 00:53:13,695
I saw her picture.

443
00:53:20,034 --> 00:53:21,334
She's dead.

444
00:54:12,954 --> 00:54:14,387
<i>I'm his whore.</i>

445
00:54:15,422 --> 00:54:16,591
<i>This is how we live.</i>

446
00:54:17,892 --> 00:54:19,961
<i>An entire country
doing what it must.</i>

447
00:54:27,467 --> 00:54:29,469
<i>And you're here, somewhere.</i>

448
00:54:31,338 --> 00:54:32,707
<i>That's how I keep you close.</i>

449
00:54:44,051 --> 00:54:45,052
<i>Three years,</i>

450
00:54:46,521 --> 00:54:47,889
<i>how is it possible?</i>

451
00:54:50,691 --> 00:54:53,795
<i>As if my life here has been
happening to someone else.</i>

452
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:04,806
<i>We're far apart,</i>

453
00:55:04,839 --> 00:55:05,940
<i>Viktor and I.</i>

454
00:55:07,542 --> 00:55:09,644
<i>We play our roles, of course.</i>

455
00:55:11,145 --> 00:55:12,412
<i>For the children.</i>

456
00:55:12,445 --> 00:55:13,648
<i>For one another.</i>

457
00:55:19,887 --> 00:55:20,922
<i>But I'm alone.</i>

458
00:55:22,757 --> 00:55:24,025
<i>And so is he.</i>

459
00:55:30,731 --> 00:55:32,600
<i>Except that
every now and then,</i>

460
00:55:32,633 --> 00:55:34,602
<i>he asks me to spend
the night with him.</i>

461
00:56:39,133 --> 00:56:41,168
<i>He's thinking
of her, of course.</i>

462
00:56:44,105 --> 00:56:45,106
<i>And I...</i>

463
00:56:47,474 --> 00:56:48,509
<i>I think of you.</i>

464
00:56:54,749 --> 00:56:56,083
They're taking him away.

465
00:56:57,551 --> 00:56:59,452
All he can do is wait his turn.

466
00:57:03,824 --> 00:57:05,660
Please.

467
00:57:05,693 --> 00:57:07,494
I wondered
when this would come up.

468
00:57:07,528 --> 00:57:08,963
Where are they taking them?

469
00:57:08,996 --> 00:57:10,531
I don't know.

470
00:57:10,564 --> 00:57:12,465
Why should I have any more
idea about it than you?

471
00:57:12,499 --> 00:57:13,567
You can help us.

472
00:57:13,601 --> 00:57:14,969
You know the people to talk to.

473
00:57:15,002 --> 00:57:16,804
Should I tell you about
the people I talk to?

474
00:57:16,837 --> 00:57:17,838
The people I talk to

475
00:57:17,872 --> 00:57:19,740
want to shut this place down
and send us home.

476
00:57:20,541 --> 00:57:22,610
What do you mean?

477
00:57:22,643 --> 00:57:24,578
- What happened?
- We're governed by morons.

478
00:57:24,612 --> 00:57:26,047
All of them terrified.

479
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:27,748
Looking for
someone else to blame.

480
00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:31,085
I'm sorry.

481
00:57:31,118 --> 00:57:33,154
So, no, I can't help
your fucking husband.

482
00:57:40,227 --> 00:57:41,629
You should have left
with your friends.

483
00:57:41,662 --> 00:57:42,863
I know.

484
00:57:50,671 --> 00:57:52,773
For Christ's sake, shut it!

485
00:58:01,716 --> 00:58:02,850
Get out of my house.

486
00:58:03,884 --> 00:58:05,252
This is not your house.

487
00:58:07,221 --> 00:58:08,255
I think you should leave.

488
00:58:13,027 --> 00:58:14,729
This might be the last time.

489
00:58:44,658 --> 00:58:45,826
Is she watching it?

490
00:58:48,295 --> 00:58:49,630
Your poor dead wife.

491
00:59:00,775 --> 00:59:01,942
Don't ever come back.

492
01:00:39,206 --> 01:00:40,741
<i>It's a miracle, Liesel.</i>

493
01:00:41,142 --> 01:00:42,143
<i>Or a joke.</i>

494
01:01:20,281 --> 01:01:22,316
Excuse me...

495
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:41,168
I'm under arrest.

496
01:01:43,270 --> 01:01:45,873
For profiteering or sabotage.

497
01:01:46,874 --> 01:01:48,042
They can't seem to decide.

498
01:02:02,056 --> 01:02:03,057
Why did you come?

499
01:02:06,126 --> 01:02:07,161
It doesn't matter.

500
01:02:09,163 --> 01:02:10,164
Please.

501
01:02:20,941 --> 01:02:21,942
You're pregnant.

502
01:02:25,479 --> 01:02:26,814
Am I the father?

503
01:02:39,093 --> 01:02:40,127
Or wasn't I?

504
01:02:43,565 --> 01:02:44,765
There was a child.

505
01:02:48,369 --> 01:02:49,370
It died inside her.

506
01:02:52,306 --> 01:02:54,008
I thought we could carry on.

507
01:02:56,110 --> 01:02:57,444
The day she leaves hospital...

508
01:03:02,983 --> 01:03:04,151
She ran a bath.

509
01:03:07,354 --> 01:03:09,423
Used my razor to open her veins.

510
01:03:19,199 --> 01:03:21,035
I wish there was something...

511
01:03:27,474 --> 01:03:28,475
Forgive me,

512
01:03:31,045 --> 01:03:32,212
but,

513
01:03:34,448 --> 01:03:35,449
I think I'm glad.

514
01:03:40,888 --> 01:03:41,889
Is this her?

515
01:03:44,458 --> 01:03:46,226
The one with the Jew husband.

516
01:03:46,994 --> 01:03:48,195
Oskar, isn't it?

517
01:03:49,997 --> 01:03:50,931
You don't have to worry,

518
01:03:50,964 --> 01:03:52,600
it's <i>Herr</i> Stahl
we're here to see.

519
01:03:59,507 --> 01:04:00,908
You should run along home.

520
01:04:01,576 --> 01:04:02,577
Home to Oskar.

521
01:04:22,429 --> 01:04:23,897
Did they come?

522
01:04:23,931 --> 01:04:25,099
Did they take him?

523
01:04:25,132 --> 01:04:26,534
There was no answer.

524
01:04:26,568 --> 01:04:27,968
They broke down the door.

525
01:04:32,540 --> 01:04:33,541
Oskar!

526
01:04:38,045 --> 01:04:39,046
Oskar!

527
01:06:14,475 --> 01:06:15,510
Take it down.

528
01:06:21,315 --> 01:06:22,983
Someone said you had baby milk.

529
01:06:30,123 --> 01:06:31,124
Have you got money?

530
01:06:42,503 --> 01:06:44,506
It is a sculptor
called Maillol.

531
01:06:46,306 --> 01:06:47,575
There's his mark on the base.

532
01:06:49,076 --> 01:06:50,812
It's worth a fair amount.

533
01:06:50,845 --> 01:06:52,747
Liesel gave it to me
on her wedding day.

534
01:06:54,448 --> 01:06:56,350
What is it, Hana? Bronze?

535
01:07:01,388 --> 01:07:03,056
Bloody hell.
Better come with me.

536
01:07:07,127 --> 01:07:08,428
Let's get in here.

537
01:07:08,462 --> 01:07:09,731
Martha!

538
01:07:11,265 --> 01:07:13,066
Christ, Martha!

539
01:07:17,772 --> 01:07:19,039
Martha!

540
01:07:22,376 --> 01:07:23,511
Martha!

541
01:07:23,545 --> 01:07:25,245
Martha!

542
01:10:09,376 --> 01:10:11,278
<i>Have I found you?</i>

543
01:10:11,311 --> 01:10:13,380
<i>Not Landauer, but Landor?</i>

544
01:10:13,413 --> 01:10:15,248
<i>Elisabeth Landor. Is that you?</i>

545
01:10:23,024 --> 01:10:25,660
<i>Perhaps in the end
you choose to forget.</i>

546
01:10:26,794 --> 01:10:28,395
<i>Or do you remember it still?</i>

547
01:10:29,296 --> 01:10:31,264
<i>The house on the hill.</i>

548
01:10:31,298 --> 01:10:32,800
<i>Those bright, foolish days.</i>

549
01:10:35,435 --> 01:10:37,404
<i>The old friend
who loved you too much.</i>

550
01:10:49,884 --> 01:10:52,252
- Oskar.
- All right.

551
01:11:01,495 --> 01:11:03,363
- This is for your mom.
- Thanks.

552
01:11:13,074 --> 01:11:15,977
A special delivery
from state security.

553
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:42,003
Hello, I received a summons.

554
01:11:57,652 --> 01:11:59,687
I sent that six months ago.

555
01:12:10,064 --> 01:12:12,834
As you can see, it suffers
in your absence,

556
01:12:12,867 --> 01:12:14,501
your beautiful house.

557
01:12:14,535 --> 01:12:16,003
Whose house?

558
01:12:18,005 --> 01:12:19,507
Whose house?

559
01:12:23,744 --> 01:12:25,112
Can't I write to my friends?

560
01:12:25,146 --> 01:12:26,581
Your friend's a cunt.

561
01:12:28,182 --> 01:12:29,550
Well, you write,

562
01:12:29,584 --> 01:12:30,985
"The address is the same.

563
01:12:31,018 --> 01:12:33,554
"Although the apartment
is a little smaller now,

564
01:12:33,588 --> 01:12:35,089
"there's a wall down the middle.

565
01:12:36,757 --> 01:12:38,993
"Our neighbor is dying.

566
01:12:39,026 --> 01:12:41,162
"I hear him coughing
through the night.

567
01:12:41,195 --> 01:12:44,497
"He was once
a professor of theology.

568
01:12:44,532 --> 01:12:46,901
"But then they sent him
down to coal mine

569
01:12:46,934 --> 01:12:48,970
"to complete his education."

570
01:12:58,746 --> 01:13:00,514
This is the bit I like.

571
01:13:01,182 --> 01:13:02,984
"I longed for you.

572
01:13:03,017 --> 01:13:04,819
"I felt you

573
01:13:04,852 --> 01:13:06,621
"here and not here,

574
01:13:06,654 --> 01:13:08,089
"like a missing limb.

575
01:13:08,122 --> 01:13:10,992
"Ached for you in every nerve
and muscle."

576
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:16,831
They tried to get it back
in the 1946, did she tell you?

577
01:13:21,102 --> 01:13:22,103
She stopped writing to me.

578
01:13:51,532 --> 01:13:52,867
Out loud.

579
01:13:56,503 --> 01:13:57,505
Go on.

580
01:13:58,773 --> 01:13:59,774
I want to hear it.

581
01:14:10,217 --> 01:14:11,786
You don't want
to read it?

582
01:14:22,263 --> 01:14:23,864
You're a school teacher.

583
01:14:25,032 --> 01:14:26,466
And you've got a son.

584
01:14:27,868 --> 01:14:31,739
I gather he's a good student
full of plans, I'm sure.

585
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:33,641
Full of hopes.

586
01:15:29,030 --> 01:15:31,899
I might have some people
around later. Is that all right?

587
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:34,602
Oh, that's okay.

588
01:15:34,635 --> 01:15:36,203
I'm going out, remember?

589
01:15:36,237 --> 01:15:38,305
Shit. Yeah.

590
01:15:41,242 --> 01:15:42,243
Good luck.

591
01:15:43,377 --> 01:15:44,578
You look great.

592
01:16:12,706 --> 01:16:15,309
There's a woman upstairs.

593
01:16:15,342 --> 01:16:18,245
Something to do with the
Department of Urban Planning.

594
01:16:19,246 --> 01:16:21,148
Said she's a friend of Grusa.

595
01:16:36,063 --> 01:16:37,865
There seems to be
a problem here.

596
01:16:38,766 --> 01:16:40,101
Only when it rains.

597
01:16:40,968 --> 01:16:42,937
Maybe Viktor was right.

598
01:16:42,970 --> 01:16:45,840
He never really liked
the idea of a flat roof.

599
01:16:45,873 --> 01:16:47,875
The reception
doesn't start till 6:00.

600
01:16:49,143 --> 01:16:52,279
I hoped I might have
a look around first.

601
01:16:53,414 --> 01:16:54,882
Didn't Grusa warn you?

602
01:16:56,817 --> 01:16:59,920
I'm writing an article.

603
01:17:01,122 --> 01:17:02,823
What kind of article?

604
01:17:03,691 --> 01:17:05,059
About the architecture.

605
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:07,761
And the story.

606
01:17:09,697 --> 01:17:11,765
I never knew what
all the fuss was about.

607
01:17:25,779 --> 01:17:28,249
Is it true that half the people
of these things are informants?

608
01:17:29,116 --> 01:17:30,317
Half of them?

609
01:17:31,252 --> 01:17:32,720
That seems unlikely.

610
01:17:36,957 --> 01:17:38,792
- You are late.
- Hello, everyone.

611
01:17:38,826 --> 01:17:40,728
Over here. Move it.

612
01:18:07,888 --> 01:18:08,923
Lanik.

613
01:18:15,095 --> 01:18:17,831
Yes, sir.

614
01:18:17,865 --> 01:18:19,266
Very interesting.

615
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:22,336
There's a place
for such opinions, of course.

616
01:18:22,369 --> 01:18:25,239
Although, we must
avoid confusion.

617
01:18:25,272 --> 01:18:28,475
We mustn't allow the public
to become demoralized.

618
01:18:28,510 --> 01:18:30,844
We must speak up
for our achievements.

619
01:19:18,892 --> 01:19:20,528
People like...

620
01:19:21,362 --> 01:19:23,330
You're just a vicious...

621
01:19:25,567 --> 01:19:27,901
You're trying to destroy us.

622
01:19:27,935 --> 01:19:31,238
You are trying to destroy
everything that this party has done.

623
01:19:36,210 --> 01:19:37,311
You are leaving?

624
01:19:41,882 --> 01:19:43,817
I think I've seen enough.

625
01:19:43,851 --> 01:19:45,886
This article,
what's it going to say?

626
01:19:47,121 --> 01:19:48,523
That the house
is falling to pieces.

627
01:19:49,156 --> 01:19:50,592
Mostly that.

628
01:19:50,625 --> 01:19:53,294
Mostly, I advise against
embarrassing the party.

629
01:19:53,327 --> 01:19:54,428
Well, Lanik.

630
01:19:55,563 --> 01:19:57,364
Don't you see? It's all over.

631
01:19:58,465 --> 01:20:00,301
Who knows what
will happen, comrade?

632
01:20:01,068 --> 01:20:02,903
Not me. Not you.

633
01:20:58,459 --> 01:21:00,628
You know
better than anyone

634
01:21:00,662 --> 01:21:02,196
how the house was made,

635
01:21:02,229 --> 01:21:03,598
what was intended.

636
01:21:06,568 --> 01:21:08,168
I can't imagine
going back.

637
01:21:10,104 --> 01:21:12,373
The event,
we hope you'll attend,

638
01:21:12,406 --> 01:21:14,308
will launch
a charitable foundation

639
01:21:14,341 --> 01:21:16,210
seeking funds around the world.

640
01:21:20,347 --> 01:21:23,250
The house
has countless admirers.

641
01:21:23,283 --> 01:21:26,554
It will operate as part
of the city museum.

642
01:21:26,588 --> 01:21:28,455
I'm grateful
for your visit, Mr. Vesely.

643
01:21:28,489 --> 01:21:30,324
But I'm not sure how I can help.

644
01:21:43,638 --> 01:21:45,673
There's one other thing.
An article

645
01:21:47,374 --> 01:21:49,076
written by a friend of yours...

646
01:21:50,512 --> 01:21:53,480
Someone else who remembers
the house as it was.

647
01:22:00,755 --> 01:22:01,955
Hana.

648
01:22:07,361 --> 01:22:08,596
She gave me a letter.

649
01:22:08,630 --> 01:22:11,031
Insisted that I put it
in your hand.

650
01:22:24,512 --> 01:22:26,013
Could I have a moment, please?

651
01:23:16,063 --> 01:23:16,931
Ma?

652
01:23:16,965 --> 01:23:20,300
Mr. Vesely. Martin.
So sorry I'm late.

653
01:23:21,803 --> 01:23:24,137
Your mother asked
for a moment alone.

654
01:23:52,165 --> 01:23:54,401
<i>And you're here,
somewhere.</i>

655
01:23:55,570 --> 01:23:57,404
<i>It's how I keep you close.</i>

656
01:26:26,788 --> 01:26:27,889
This is Oskar.

657
01:26:28,990 --> 01:26:30,692
My son.

658
01:26:30,725 --> 01:26:33,628
Oskar. I'm so glad to meet you.

659
01:26:35,763 --> 01:26:37,732
Welcome back to Czechoslovakia.

660
01:26:51,445 --> 01:26:52,880
It's bigger
than I remember.

661
01:26:55,683 --> 01:26:56,617
Maybe it's too big.

662
01:26:56,651 --> 01:26:58,986
Maybe they're right
to turn it into a museum.

663
01:27:08,930 --> 01:27:10,998
I realize something terrible.

664
01:27:11,032 --> 01:27:12,967
I never knew Lanik's first name.

665
01:27:15,603 --> 01:27:17,270
What do you suppose
will happen to him?

666
01:27:18,773 --> 01:27:19,807
I don't know.

667
01:27:20,541 --> 01:27:22,409
But he'll manage.

668
01:27:22,442 --> 01:27:23,745
You can be fairly sure of that.

669
01:27:31,451 --> 01:27:33,654
Do you think he'll let me stay
just for tonight?

670
01:27:36,758 --> 01:27:38,458
I don't want
to sleep in a hotel.

671
01:27:40,728 --> 01:27:41,896
I'll make sure of it.

672
01:27:59,479 --> 01:28:01,716
I thought we should have
some more of this dreadful wine.

673
01:28:09,957 --> 01:28:13,326
He built himself
a yacht, was out on his own.

674
01:28:15,997 --> 01:28:17,364
Squall...

675
01:28:19,734 --> 01:28:20,935
It felt...

676
01:28:22,036 --> 01:28:23,571
Like the end of everything.

677
01:28:51,431 --> 01:28:53,935
Good evening.

678
01:28:53,968 --> 01:28:55,770
Hi. Nice to meet you.

679
01:29:05,412 --> 01:29:07,380
We sat here. Do you remember?

680
01:29:08,115 --> 01:29:09,750
Of course I remember.

681
01:29:29,837 --> 01:29:31,606
I never stopped
thinking about it.

682
01:29:34,141 --> 01:29:36,077
How you wanted me,
how I refused.

683
01:29:38,846 --> 01:29:41,381
Because I had to leave
and thought I'd fall apart.

684
01:29:47,454 --> 01:29:49,422
And now I'm afraid
it's too late.

685
01:29:52,059 --> 01:29:53,995
How could it ever be too late?

686
01:33:47,394 --> 01:33:51,065
The Russians.
Ma, we've got to go.

687
01:33:51,098 --> 01:33:53,701
Oskar found a guy who can
take us to the border.

688
01:33:53,734 --> 01:33:55,035
But we have to go now.

689
01:34:32,907 --> 01:34:33,974
I know.

690
01:34:34,875 --> 01:34:36,844
Ma, we've gotta go.

691
01:34:38,212 --> 01:34:39,413
Please, wait.

692
01:34:43,150 --> 01:34:44,218
I can't go.

693
01:34:49,924 --> 01:34:50,925
If I stay,

694
01:34:54,862 --> 01:34:55,963
will you have me?

695
01:35:00,267 --> 01:35:01,268
Of course.

696
01:35:32,933 --> 01:35:35,369
The house, the plans.
None of it's gonna happen.

697
01:35:37,104 --> 01:35:38,105
I know.

698
01:35:39,240 --> 01:35:40,341
Doesn't matter.

699
01:35:49,416 --> 01:35:51,018
It was so beautiful.

700
01:35:55,590 --> 01:35:56,790
Yes.

701
01:35:58,025 --> 01:35:59,093
Yes, it was.

702
01:36:08,202 --> 01:36:10,938
She said, "Rainer,

703
01:36:10,971 --> 01:36:13,307
"My clothes?
Where do I put my clothes?"

704
01:36:13,340 --> 01:36:15,142
I said, "It's a weekend house.

705
01:36:15,175 --> 01:36:17,311
"You only need one dress.

706
01:36:17,344 --> 01:36:18,979
"Hang it on the back
of the bedroom door."

707
01:36:30,057 --> 01:36:31,058
Wait.

708
01:36:34,228 --> 01:36:35,229
The sun.

709
01:36:41,902 --> 01:36:42,903
Come on.

710
01:36:44,471 --> 01:36:45,573
Any moment now.

711
01:36:51,078 --> 01:36:52,179
Let's see the wall.

712
01:36:57,284 --> 01:36:58,285
Look.

713
01:37:02,222 --> 01:37:03,991
Here it comes.

714
01:37:06,060 --> 01:37:07,161
Here it comes.

715
01:37:12,900 --> 01:37:14,068
It's beautiful.
