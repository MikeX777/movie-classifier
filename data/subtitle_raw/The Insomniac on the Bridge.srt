1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:13,430
 The Awakened of the Pont de l'Alma

2
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:39,940
My God. I've slept badly.

3
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:42,320
My God.

4
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,670
I've slept badly.

5
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:04,990
What are you looking at?

6
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,720
What are you looking at?

7
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:22,780
The Seine.

8
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,470
Me too.

9
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,900
You have nice eyes.

10
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:34,640
My son will have your eyes.

11
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,040
In that case...

12
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,340
In that case?

13
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,540
Hadn't we'd better get married?

14
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,410
It only follows.

15
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:54,670
I'm happy to hear you say it.

16
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,910
That's surprising.

17
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,530
I think that it's going
to be rather shocking.

18
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,190
It's a shame our place isn't like yours.

19
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,630
Kiss me.

20
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,560
No.

21
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,520
We're being watched.

22
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,190
So what?

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,490
Married people often do such things.

24
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,540
Sir, do you have a light?

25
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:39,610
Such horrors.

26
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:43,250
I seem to have gone and asked you
for something that is too easily had.

27
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:46,110
I was just about to fall asleep
and now you've woken me up.

28
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:49,010
Sorry, but in fact I
would like to speak to you.

29
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:50,340
Not today.

30
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,130
Why?

31
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,730
Too much to do.

32
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:54,620
When could  I see you again?

33
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,190
In seven months.

34
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,860
Here's to our son.

35
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:21,210
He's here.

36
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,340
You feel him?

37
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,650
No. You couldn't feel him yet.

38
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,820
He doesn't think so.

39
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:35,860
You won't believe it.

40
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:39,750
He's moving with exactly the same
rhythm as that man's hands.

41
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,800
I love you.

42
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,540
I've got to fly.

43
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,490
I'll be back at 3 p.m.

44
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:49,800
Good day, Monsieur.

45
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:51,090
Good Day.

46
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,130
Monsieur. I've been observing
you for a long time.

47
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,290
You'd better stop
doing that immediately.

48
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,120
I don't like conversing with
strangers.  I prefer solitude.

49
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:05,950
If you're looking for somebody whether
that would be a homosexual, a barbarian,

50
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,720
or a philosopher, you're wasting
your time with me.

51
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,500
Monsieur, I'm not
exactly just a stranger.

52
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:16,500
I've read you with the same ecstasy that
gets on my nerves with a certain novel.

53
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,880
- But...
- But what?

54
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,050
You're promised to meet
me seven months ago.

55
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,530
So?

56
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,030
I'm a boxer, Monsieur:

57
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:30,950
I want to place myself at your service.

58
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,980
To do what?

59
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,920
To help support to you
in the insupportable.

60
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:37,600
You mean...

61
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,130
Need a light?

62
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,110
It's true that I don't sleep much.

63
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,140
Not much?

64
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,130
Barely sleep at all...

65
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,760
even less than myself?

66
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,320
- You, too?
- Mmhmm.

67
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,630
And how.

68
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,280
You like taking long walks at night.

69
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,560
I adore that.

70
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,950
Nothing better.

71
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,150
After all,

72
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,450
the most beautiful whores
only come out at night.

73
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:00,740
Oh? You like women?

74
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,170
Mmmm... that's my downfall.

75
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,840
I've had bad luck with women.

76
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,680
They'll play along a little and
then,  everything's over.

77
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,930
Women only like to make love and little else.

78
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,440
They're animals,
they can't help it.

79
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,250
You've gone out.

80
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:16,420
Speaking of making babies,

81
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,200
look down there at that woman.

82
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:24,780
I have had the privllege of seeing
that woman laugh. It was marvelous.

83
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,770
Don't talk of morals,
don't talk of humanity...

84
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,970
With symptoms like those,
that woman's pregnant.

85
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,760
Pregnant? Despicable!

86
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,320
Hold on. You're crazy.  Stop!

87
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:37,610
- Where are you going?
- Sleep!

88
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,380
Excuse me but do you
intend to rape here?

89
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,360
I feel an obligation to intervene.

90
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,300
That's it.

91
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,220
Again.

92
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,280
What are you waiting for?

93
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,580
- Me --
- Come here.

94
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,660
Never, I told you.

95
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,110
Oh yes.

96
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,440
She's sweet.

97
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,560
She doesn't seem outraged.

98
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,880
She's having sweet dreams.

99
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,850
My God. What are we doing?

100
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,570
I don't recognize myself.

101
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,250
I'm starting to get excited.

102
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,400
It was bound to happen.

103
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:27,150
But it's unthinkable....
me, rape a pregnant woman?

104
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,790
It's odd what I'm about to do.

105
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,940
I'll make a sort of double for myself.

106
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,940
Enough!  Start raping
and get off the double!

107
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:52,380
Just a second!

108
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,620
Hurry up, pine nut!

109
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:01,690
It's not easy. There all kinds of little
manipulations that are too obvious.

110
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,780
Are you done?

111
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:11,150
I never believed I'd again be capable of
intimacy with anyone never mind a woman.

112
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:13,790
Well?

113
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:18,050
That foreigner, she sure
got a good whiff of me.

114
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,490
Let's go have a coffee.

115
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,300
So you want to talk?

116
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,480
He'll talk, no matter when or to whom.

117
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:34,210
People let themselves to talk
very quickly. I think it's a shame.

118
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:37,670
So here we are in
some kind of struggle.

119
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,440
Good. That's given you some heart.

120
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,680
Do you like theory?

121
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:48,390
I adore it.

122
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:52,750
Having searched far and wide for
the causes of your transformations.

123
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,790
What would those be?

124
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,820
I believe I've found

125
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,010
the point of departure
for all of these theories:

126
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,920
I propose that getting lit
causes sleep disturbances.

127
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,080
That's an old one.

128
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,370
You're a bad apple, you.

129
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,170
So I've been told.

130
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,300
A rascal.

131
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:27,520
Well...

132
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:31,020
Yes, in general.

133
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,810
Look here.

134
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,870
This hand, for example.

135
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:40,430
This hand...

136
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:43,620
Who is making this hand
move if it isn't me?

137
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:48,580
Me?

138
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,010
Yeah?

139
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:52,460
Take it.

140
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,680
Yes, in fact or yes, maybe.

141
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,670
But maybe not.

142
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,090
Anyway, not me.

143
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,870
So according to you, we're
driven by hidden forces.

144
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,820
While we share the
bodily mass of a kind,

145
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,800
each mass is an independent system.

146
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,820
And within the interior of this system,

147
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,370
everything is mixed up.

148
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,570
I'm ready to share my system with you.

149
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,890
So it is very possible that my hand
should compose part of your body.

150
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,310
If only...

151
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,610
in the left knee.

152
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,410
Are you going to leave?

153
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:36,490
Right on schedule.

154
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:40,440
It could also be that both
belong to someone else.

155
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:42,570
Who else?

156
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:45,080
Go ahead and leave.  They
are making all of our decisions.

157
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,350
That's frightening.

158
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:50,660
Yes.

159
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:54,720
And this theory is a joke to you?

160
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:59,910
Forced to reexamine the dimensions of
this theory, I'm plunged into the depths

161
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,930
of function theory.

162
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,100
And that is what you've uncovered

163
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,180
about the motives of
our respective insomnias?

164
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,860
It's something like that.

165
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,330
Other stakes, they'll find out.

166
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,990
I believe in your bodily system theory

167
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:24,470
more than that
mysticism of my daydreams.

168
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,740
Not if you are not better.

169
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,360
You persist in remember.

170
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,060
I'll need to wash my hair.

171
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,030
I was only showing off certain reservations.

172
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:38,810
What is it?

173
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,890
Have I said something to upset you?

174
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,000
Hold on.

175
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:46,510
- You're pale.
- Indeed.

176
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,710
It's begun: the merger.

177
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,820
Yes. It has begun.

178
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,470
It's odd...

179
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,330
but everyone...

180
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,250
everyone is taking orders fromf a fetus.

181
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:07,750
Yes...

182
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,450
just a fetus.

183
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,900
Don't you need to cry about your son?

184
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:28,620
I don't need to any more.

185
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,490
He is being much nicer now.

186
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:34,650
He's almost not crying at all.

187
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:36,210
Much better.

188
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,670
Sleepy?

189
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,080
No.

190
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:48,890
I'm closing my eyes....

191
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:50,010
that's all.

192
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,930
See you soon.

193
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,560
- You again?
- That's right.

194
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,450
How onerous, these duties.

195
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:17,050
Your conversation enchants me.

196
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:18,920
But I do mean completely.

197
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,960
Can I ask you a question?

198
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,180
Personal?

199
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,200
Not really.

200
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,550
Go ahead.

201
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,040
Over the months, I've watched you

202
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,760
Often during the day over the past month,

203
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,100
You often return while it is spitting.

204
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,670
I'm waiting.

205
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,130
Waiting for what?

206
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:34,990
A barge.

207
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,590
A lighter in particular?

208
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:37,590
Yes.

209
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,580
And what in particular
about this lighter?

210
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,680
A kid.

211
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,040
A kid?

212
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,150
What kid?

213
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,510
I think he should be..

214
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,930
He looks like a double of myself.

215
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:50,650
It's a long story.

216
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:52,370
Spit it out, this sweet story.

217
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:55,550
On this barge,

218
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,460
there is... a child.

219
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,910
who has been beaten without mercy.

220
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,480
And?

221
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,460
That's all.

222
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:09,740
I'm crushed.

223
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:14,300
Feel that. It's getting nice.

224
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,990
The light is peeking
through the clouds.

225
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,340
It's all coming together beautifuly.

226
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,750
Have a look over there
at that woman with a suitcase.

227
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,390
But I know that woman very well.

228
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,870
You do, too.

229
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,680
My God, is it true?

230
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:49,130
What is she doing here, this time?

231
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,080
She's going to commit suicide
due to the shock of the rape.

232
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,480
What you're waiting for....

233
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,490
She's waiting for your lighter, perhaps.

234
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,120
Did I tell you that she's here due to
some marvelous coincidence?

235
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,780
Thanks.,

236
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:09,200
but I can't see what you're getting at?

237
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:13,030
You'd like to go to sleep, wouldn't you?

238
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,360
I tried but failed.

239
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,730
I've seen you.

240
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,720
Let me try again.

241
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,830
I'm begging you. Let me.

242
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,420
I really want to...

243
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:24,660
except...

244
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:25,990
oh, I don't know.

245
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,000
Except what? Shit!

246
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,780
Do you believe it's possible to sleep

247
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,770
here?

248
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:31,830
Absolutely.

249
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:33,990
A drink...

250
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:36,540
Drinking in my room made me lose sleep.

251
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,380
All right,

252
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,730
except if I understand you right,

253
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,390
Go to sleep. Shut your eyes.

254
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:46,570
I wouldn't want to fall asleep
before the little woman blows off.

255
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:49,430
Her, blow off?

256
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,860
My eye!

257
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:53,830
All right then.

258
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:55,720
Go ahead.

259
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:02,790
Sleep!

260
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,670
Are you asleep?

261
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:10,340
Oh yes.

262
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:11,900
It's wonderful.

263
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,630
Good.

264
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,230
My turn now.

265
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:20,450
Say "sleep" for me.

266
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:23,000
I meant to say sleep!

267
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,170
Say "sleep" for me... shit!

268
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,750
You've woken me up.

269
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:37,090
She's blown off.

270
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,600
Yes, it's true damn it.

271
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:45,450
She's coming back to see us, I hope.

272
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,310
That's the way it goes.

273
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:50,560
Every time I sleep, even for a minute,
something essential is lost.

274
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,030
Nothing but a blink of sleep!

275
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,320
Oh how hard I've tried.

276
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:56,830
No kidding?

277
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,580
I have a method.

278
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:01,610
What method is that?

279
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,850
Antoine, we're plunged

280
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,520
into such delirium
since the naval battle.

281
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:50,290
Thanks to Oedipus,

282
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:54,140
in the midst of sleep,
all anyone yearns for is

283
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,370
the sleep to come.

284
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,990
Yes, only for that.

285
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:05,700
While you sleep, a lot happens.

286
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:09,040
I maintain that when you fall asleep,

287
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,660
something essential is lost.

288
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,580
What can you drink while asleep?

289
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:17,170
A bit more than you can eat.

290
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:22,620
They never eat.

291
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:28,350
Oh no?

292
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:30,570
Is that right, Malraux?

293
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:33,870
Voltaire?

294
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,890
Say yes, my love.

295
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,960
The awakened don't eat,
they dream destruction.

296
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:41,210
Enough. You're fooling yourself.

297
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:42,730
What do you mean?

298
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,830
It was a pity, but he had to die,
since he'd eaten anothers' pie.

299
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:47,810
To this rebus,

300
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:49,290
I respond.

301
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,670
Such amazement, disturbed all brotherhood.

302
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:53,610
Be careful!

303
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:57,030
A word uttered in sarcasm
is a sin quite mortal.

304
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:59,210
I would have said it is quite Marcel.

305
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,750
Shit! Shit!

306
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,890
They don't like what you are.

307
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:10,960
Excuse me?

308
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,480
Surrounded on all sides, I still would
not like to observe your habits.

309
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,490
Yeah?

310
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,400
Perhaps I'm being a little naive.

311
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,360
Which goes to say,
that the supreme dream

312
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,410
is not to sleep but it is not
to sleep without disturbances.

313
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,480
And what disburbs you?

314
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,610
There's no telling...

315
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:51,280
Sleep!

316
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,700
Sleep!

317
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:05,830
That's it.

318
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,520
It's flooding over you.

319
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:19,040
Papa?

320
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,380
Yes.

321
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,210
Can I ask you a question?

322
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,420
Yes.

323
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:28,860
Why, since you look after the dead,
have you shown me only one corpse?

324
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,290
Oh, that.

325
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,930
You haven't answered me.

326
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:42,030
If you won't talk to me any more,

327
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,280
I'm leaving.

328
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,720
See you soon.

329
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,400
Maybe.

330
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:53,020
I...

331
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,170
eat...

332
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:58,570
What is it?

333
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,930
What is it Michel?

334
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,730
What?

335
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:09,560
Are you done?

336
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,110
Get ready for the day.

337
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:26,440
This won't do.

338
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,440
See you soon.

339
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,100
Too late.

340
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,170
I'm waiting to get dressed.

341
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,920
I can tell you one strange thing.

342
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,410
It's that..

343
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,100
I adore getting dressed.

344
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,990
I get dressed to protect myself.

345
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,960
But I'm sure that I
was almost not dressed.

346
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:00,380
It's a certainty.

347
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,370
I... I adore getting dressed.

348
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,020
Do you believe me?

349
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:07,760
Yes.

350
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:10,840
Well.  Very well.

351
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:19,250
Do you think it may have
ecological consequences?

352
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,260
Listen.

353
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:26,350
Following my examination, I find that
you have been injured in a lover's quarrel.

354
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,440
I suspect what I'm about to tell you
may come as something of a shock.

355
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:40,040
In effect, as far as I'm concerned,
the circumstances interest us both.

356
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:42,380
and these coincidences
are also compelling.

357
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:43,700
So... in a few words,

358
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:49,310
some years ago, my wife had an accident
in circumstances similar to yours.

359
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,300
Following this accident,

360
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:53,440
she killed herself.

361
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:57,650
And I thought as soon as I saw you
that you would tell me the same.

362
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:58,900
Your accident,

363
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:01,730
perhaps for both together we could...

364
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,270
intimate an adventure?

365
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:08,660
Crazy ideas.

366
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:13,950
Cube, the sphere comes closer.

367
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,790
And then,

368
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,990
wounded,

369
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,480
the sphere refuses the union.

370
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:25,990
A little communication,

371
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:28,530
and then nothing.

372
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:29,950
Oh no!

373
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:31,570
Don't start that.

374
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:34,600
Do you find it easy

375
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,420
in general to amuse yourself?

376
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,760
Ah yes. I get it.

377
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,590
I... I discern
an old lady here.

378
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,420
Move her.

379
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:49,500
A little more.

380
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,490
Ah... that's it.

381
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:54,870
Enjoying that?

382
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,450
Trying to.

383
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:00,210
Wait.

384
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:03,320
Don't leave.

385
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:06,590
Wait for the end.

386
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,850
But...

387
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,820
it's not over yet.

388
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:15,950
He never waits for the end.

389
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:19,880
That's what leads to crime...

390
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,120
Nothing will stand, that old saying goes.

391
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,810
I am sure you'll share a lot of
interests the two of you.

392
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:34,920
Me, too.

393
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,080
And what is he waiting for?

394
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:39,490
Michel?

395
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,870
What is it?

396
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:42,930
He's not there.

397
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:45,840
Whenever he feels like avoiding
intimacy, he absents himself.

398
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,270
It's hard being deprived of affection.

399
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:49,140
Yes.

400
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:57,090
Papa?

401
00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:00,380
Does the trees move
when no one's watching?

402
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:01,990
For a long march?

403
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,680
It's a little funny what you've
just said, very, very funny.

404
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,300
Boy?

405
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:31,640
Alain?

406
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,490
Alain!

407
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:38,860
Yes?

408
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,720
They're magnificent, all of these clothes.

409
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:52,430
Is there any dangerous that if I wear
it might raise your temperature?

410
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,270
No.

411
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:58,190
But it's a little big for you, that coat.

412
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:00,190
No. It's not too big.

413
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,070
This one here is:

414
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:05,140
the most beautiful.

415
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:08,600
It's magnificient.

416
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,620
That one's even moreso.

417
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:17,700
Anne.  Anne?

418
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,960
Anne, you're not going
to go out like that, are?

419
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,890
Yes. Of course.

420
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:30,580
But you'll see.  With resilience.

421
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:32,910
I'm going out like this.

422
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,220
Yes.

423
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,650
And Anne?

424
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,860
Anne looking good.

425
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,680
Sleep!

426
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:46,990
You really want him, this child?

427
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,120
...he wants me.

428
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,890
What do you mean?

429
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,890
I mean that we...

430
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:56,920
Hold on...

431
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,530
You talk like Violette.

432
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,760
I am Violette.

433
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:07,580
Do you love me?

434
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,900
I love you.

435
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,660
She's already fallen asleep...

436
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:30,090
Funny old thing, falling asleep
during sexual foreplay.

437
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,220
I love you.

438
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,760
That's not true.

439
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:41,620
Those who fall asleep during
sexual don't love their partners.

440
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,250
Good.

441
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,930
What are you doing at my place?

442
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:54,350
Don't be a fool , we're at their place.

443
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,430
A lot is coming our way right now.

444
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,880
- It's better this way.
- Yes, Marcel.

445
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:00,160
Good.

446
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,390
Alain. I've seen you.
You are very, very sick.

447
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:05,570
Yes. Very, very sick.

448
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:07,010
Don't move.

449
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:09,840
You know I want to kill you , chump!

450
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,630
I don't recognize you at all anymore.

451
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:12,850
As usual.

452
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,240
Ah, yes.

453
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,070
It's a dream.

454
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:17,080
Just one?

455
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,160
Clear that up.

456
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:20,540
Come with me.

457
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:22,830
You should leave by the window.

458
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:23,580
Ah no.

459
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,270
no, no.

460
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,240
I've already had this dream.

461
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:29,680
At least, that's something..

462
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,870
I was having fun while you were dreaming.

463
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:35,360
Doing what for example?

464
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,990
Making love.

465
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:39,380
Oh no, Marcel. Not that.

466
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,600
I'd certainly remember such a spectacle.

467
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,630
She's already sleeping.

468
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:53,220
Go ahead.

469
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,820
She's waiting for you.

470
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:04,770
See you later.

471
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,460
And the children?

472
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:08,770
Dream children.

473
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,280
Oh Antoine. You're funny,
how funny you are.

474
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:16,750
I love you more than anyone else.

475
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:20,320
Me, too. But in a fashion more or less Platonic...

476
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,490
Shit.

477
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:32,670
That blindman, for example.

478
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,270
He hears us.

479
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:37,790
But I have never understood him.

480
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:39,990
Which one? That one up there?

481
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,780
Being a being to be beaten

482
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:42,770
Hey, Monsieur?

483
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,300
Monsieur

484
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,000
Come here.

485
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:52,960
Closer.

486
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,250
Come here.

487
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,740
Closer.

488
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:58,040
Closer!

489
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,130
Much closer!

490
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,600
At your service.

491
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,660
And now...

492
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:06,640
Sleep!

493
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,220
He's fast asleep.

494
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:12,020
Since you're asleep...

495
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,240
See!

496
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:15,190
See what?

497
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:16,230
Good question.

498
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:20,570
Because when I look around,
I only see blurry shapes.

499
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,600
Tell me.

500
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,090
It's worse than we thought.

501
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:25,240
Nonetheless...

502
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:28,220
if I look around with a little more attention,

503
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:29,790
I can see

504
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:31,190
a cube

505
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,790
and a sphere.

506
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,440
What a winner.

507
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:36,510
He's cheating, this blind man.

508
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,480
You are more secret.

509
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:40,500
And you,

510
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:41,710
the sphere.

511
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:44,150
That's no fair, I wanted to be you.

512
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,390
He cheats!

513
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,180
He can't see well at all.

514
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,530
Where have you put she who
drinks more than all of us.

515
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,330
Yes.

516
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:56,200
I see a woman here.

517
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,260
Where is she?

518
00:30:58,010 --> 00:30:58,960
Where is she?

519
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,160
Show her to us.

520
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,180
Here.

521
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:13,480
What does she
want here, this girl?

522
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:14,770
To sell herself.

523
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:16,150
But,

524
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:17,810
obviously, she wants to get married.

525
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:20,180
That's brilliant.

526
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,060
Woman:

527
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,780
Will you take in wedlock this man

528
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:24,550
to your right?

529
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:26,700
Yes, my love.

530
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:29,470
Will you take in wedlock this man

531
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:31,010
to your left?

532
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:32,910
Yes, my love.

533
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:33,560
And you?

534
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:36,200
Will you take as a wife

535
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,740
this drowned woman?

536
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,700
Who are you calling drowned?

537
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:41,020
I see.

538
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,410
Answer, Marcel!

539
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:44,050
Say yes.

540
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,510
Yes.
Shit!

541
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:46,710
You?

542
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:49,720
Well, yes. Didn't have I not already
indicated that by saying it for Marcel?

543
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,610
I hereby declare you husbands

544
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,280
and wife.

545
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,110
This blindman is beginning to annoy me.

546
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,600
Let me show you the way.

547
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:57,850
Get lost.

548
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:33,860
What's the word?

549
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:35,430
Good evening, Alain.

550
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,300
What's been going on?

551
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,110
We've been having a lot of fun.

552
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:40,700
Haven't we, Michel?

553
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:42,220
She's no fun.

554
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,660
Michel,

555
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:46,030
could you be nicer to Anne?

556
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,620
She's very sensitive.

557
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:50,290
And I would like you to be my wife,

558
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:52,190
if you will will accept.

559
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:55,810
Anne? Do you really believe that
this day is going to repeat itself?

560
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:58,130
Don't lose hope.

561
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:01,180
Today, you have agreed to speak to me.

562
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,020
Papa.

563
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,650
It's moronic to say you love her.

564
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:07,590
She doesn't love poets.

565
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:09,970
I have a little poser
who won't stop fidgeting.

566
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,600
Like your poems, poses
must be kept up.

567
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,850
Isn't that right, Alain?

568
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,470
I can see again that you're
going to be very happy together.

569
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,300
Formidable.

570
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,200
Papa?

571
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:39,090
I notice that you haven't hugged Anne yet.

572
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:41,400
That's not very nice of you.

573
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:43,280
Hang on.  That's true.

574
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:45,810
You'll see.

575
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:47,830
She'll be very happy.

576
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,460
Anne?  I'm waiting for you.

577
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:58,770
Oh yes. He would like to
present some charades tonight.

578
00:33:58,890 --> 00:33:59,660
Instead of this?

579
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:01,590
Do what you want.

580
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:04,630
Anyway, you're already doing
the same thing, you know?

581
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,370
It's not the same thing at all.

582
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,180
The bridge.

583
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,650
The drowned man.

584
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,360
The two friends.

585
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:32,410
The scene is the philosopher's engagement.

586
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:40,510
The blinding of the captain.

587
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:48,090
The wind.

588
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,910
The blind man takes
the hand of the nude dancer.

589
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,820
The burial of remains.

590
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:07,240
The invalids' treasure.

591
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:18,790
See you soon,

592
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:19,640
maybe.

593
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:23,140
What have I done now?

594
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:26,560
No matter what you say,
he detests it.

595
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:28,900
poor kid.

596
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:33,860
I beginning to get exaspirated.

597
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,300
We're tired.

598
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:41,930
You tired?

599
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,050
That wouldn't be so,

600
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:47,780
if I weren't too much for us.

601
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,080
It's too late, you know.

602
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,630
No. It's not too late.

603
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:55,920
It's never too late.

604
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:57,670
Look.

605
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,610
He left.

606
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:04,880
For once I can talk??

607
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,830
I love you.

608
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:10,880
I love you.

609
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:18,830
Who are you?

610
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,470
What a funny question.

611
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:22,590
Why?

612
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:24,030
And you?

613
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:24,970
Who are you?

614
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,710
Killers have told me who you are.

615
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:33,900
You are the cube

616
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:34,960
and also

617
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:36,930
you are sphere.

618
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,440
I knew it.

619
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,160
I knew it.

620
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,560
Curiosity is stronger than dreams

621
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,550
of which much the same
applies to my contemporaries.

622
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:09,770
I was coming through here by chance.

623
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,980
In that case, Goodbye.

624
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,600
Marcel!

625
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,020
Such a need for contact.

626
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:18,990
Such absurd affection.

627
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:21,460
Such adorableness.

628
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,580
Such unusual improvisation.

629
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:27,820
You always surprise me.

630
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,680
See you later.

631
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:33,730
I decided to follow up on your
experiments, afterwards.

632
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:36,640
A little behind, huh?

633
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:44,260
I intend to publish both of them
and have sent opinion letters

634
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,590
to the Journal of Freudian Analysis.

635
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:49,590
The thrust of it is, he wants to analyze us.

636
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:50,740
Ever do that?

637
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:51,840
With that woman, yes.

638
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:54,780
You'll consider it?

639
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:57,980
- So long.
- So long.

640
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,500
See you later, old man.

641
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:02,730
Know how you can do to be sure
you aren't been sleepwalking?

642
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:04,570
How?

643
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,560
On its way.

644
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,170
A one-a and two-a...

645
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:10,770
There. That's better.

646
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:15,950
I'm sure that you will come.

647
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:19,060
Get something for that, Doctor.

648
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,020
Michel around here?

649
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:41,590
Marcel.

650
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:42,690
Are you there?

651
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:43,640
Yeah.

652
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:45,800
What does he like?

653
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,400
Football?

654
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:51,540
I don't like football.

655
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:53,390
What would you like?

656
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:54,450
Nothing.

657
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:57,550
Antoine.

658
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,270
Are you here?

659
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:00,460
Yes.

660
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:03,270
At day's bottom.

661
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,080
We'll see about that.

662
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:43,750
Michel.

663
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:47,200
Are you here?

664
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:49,380
It's not me.

665
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,770
It's a friend.

666
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:52,800
And what's he doing?

667
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:57,280
He's sad because his mother
didn't come to find him after school

668
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:59,800
and refuses to acknowledge him.

669
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:02,130
You never would have done that.

670
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,010
It's curtains, poor fool.

671
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:07,800
I think I'm speaking very well.

672
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,370
Precisely the problem. Less drunk.

673
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:16,240
Rascal!

674
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,400
So what?

675
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,470
I only tell myself that if you drink,
there must be a good reason.

676
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:23,550
- Is that possible?
- Well, sure. Why not?

677
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:38,840
Can I ask you to breathe
in deep for a moment?

678
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:42,290
And me? Can I?

679
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:44,870
Doctor,

680
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:49,180
it must be a pain to have to
bury so many women at once.

681
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,840
Well. What's your opinion?

682
00:40:57,790 --> 00:40:59,380
By just a hair's breadth.

683
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:01,420
Shit. Just a few seconds left.

684
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:02,680
9

685
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:03,560
8

686
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:04,670
7

687
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:05,750
6

688
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:06,810
5

689
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:07,850
4

690
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:08,950
3

691
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,030
2

692
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,140
1

693
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:41,810
That went a too far.

694
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:48,690
I just had the same nightmare.

695
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:50,060
The drowned woman?

696
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:02,690
Good morning, Alain.

697
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:04,590
What's this?

698
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:05,760
You're here?

699
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:08,280
Well, I haven't gone out today.

700
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:10,680
It's true, papa.

701
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,050
She's had her fill.

702
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,450
But we can play together,

703
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:17,910
don't we, Michel?

704
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,040
Not with me.

705
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:22,090
My friend won't wait for me forever.

706
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:23,880
He's very jealous.

707
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,660
It's not said "jealouse," it's said "jaloux."

708
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:30,280
See you soon. Maybe.

709
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,220
Shit.

710
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:41,930
Well...

711
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:43,620
He shouldn't have said that.

712
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:49,440
My vulnerable little girl.

713
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,810
Allpowerful man.

714
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,630
Anne. I need to speak to you.

715
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,280
Since reflecting on what has
occured this morning,

716
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,520
I have thought of a way.

717
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,800
I'll confront him.

718
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:06,550
Again?

719
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,980
It depends. We'll talk.

720
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:10,890
But that's the kind of thing
you'd say to your wife.

721
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:12,570
Don't talk to me about that woman.

722
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:15,060
I hate that poor girl.

723
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:20,010
He has come, no?

724
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:24,530
Yes. He's here.

725
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:25,950
He...

726
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:50,620
Excuse me.

727
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:51,460
I beg you pardon, but

728
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:53,060
you must have some
idea if there is a bomb?

729
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:54,360
I must know everything.

730
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:56,410
Essential, but...

731
00:45:56,530 --> 00:45:58,830
I could talk for a drink. A drink!

732
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:01,750
Focus.

733
00:46:01,870 --> 00:46:02,760
Give me that.

734
00:46:03,110 --> 00:46:04,710
I know everything.

735
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:12,740
First, a few words.

736
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:16,250
The men of this part of the world
reached an agreement that they would

737
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:18,070
exchange gifts among themselves.

738
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:19,690
Why would they do that?

739
00:46:22,130 --> 00:46:22,640
Well...

740
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:23,820
Listen

741
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:28,370
For thousands of years, men were
living in misery and distress.

742
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:31,750
So then they decided

743
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:32,860
to find

744
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:34,710
a s...

745
00:46:35,090 --> 00:46:36,830
savior of wax to

746
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:38,230
come and

747
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:39,970
save them.

748
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:41,890
Why d...

749
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:43,760
do that?

750
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:45,040
So

751
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:46,470
they'd b...

752
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:48,570
be saved.

753
00:46:50,210 --> 00:46:51,990
So the poem is the good news:

754
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:53,400
God sent

755
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,820
the comet flying.

756
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:56,640
Seriously.

757
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:01,420
You know that Christ came to save us.

758
00:47:03,370 --> 00:47:04,880
And that he came from a virgin.

759
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,560
What is a virgin?

760
00:47:08,350 --> 00:47:10,330
A virgin is a woman

761
00:47:10,670 --> 00:47:12,070
who hasn't had any relations.

762
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:14,810
What are relations?

763
00:47:15,810 --> 00:47:19,050
Relations consist in being
hugged very very hard.

764
00:47:20,230 --> 00:47:21,780
But, it's also

765
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:24,450
a message signed by a minister.

766
00:47:25,730 --> 00:47:26,720
What is a minister?

767
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:29,590
A minister is a functionary

768
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,120
who delves into mysteries.

769
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:33,960
What is a mystery?

770
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,400
A mystery is a little fish.

771
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:38,530
And this is why

772
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:40,300
I don't want any more gifts.

773
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:42,850
Gifts are for the virgin.

774
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:45,820
Michel...

775
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:47,590
you're becoming pretentious.

776
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:49,420
Don't move.

777
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:50,870
The gift is over there.

778
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:53,530
It's still safe isn't it?

779
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:54,880
It's a car.

780
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:58,350
You believe in revealing everything
ever since he broke something?

781
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:00,020
I don't know.

782
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:02,190
I'll bore a hole through this...

783
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:04,660
swoon.

784
00:48:06,170 --> 00:48:07,070
Swoon?

785
00:48:09,350 --> 00:48:10,350
I said "swoon"?

786
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:11,910
That's what you said.

787
00:48:16,650 --> 00:48:18,020
Curious.

788
00:48:58,360 --> 00:48:59,690
Who are you?

789
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:08,730
I am your mother.

790
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:11,410
How do you know?

791
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:14,480
Because I've had my eyes closed.

792
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:17,180
Where are you?

793
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:20,150
I'm dead.

794
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:23,390
I know that.

795
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:25,020
My father told me about it.

796
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:26,520
He told you what?

797
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:30,180
That you were

798
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:31,440
up there.

799
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:35,200
But why "up there," precisely?

800
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:38,340
He didn't say "up there, precisely."

801
00:49:38,830 --> 00:49:40,170
What did he say?

802
00:49:40,290 --> 00:49:41,640
He said, up there.

803
00:49:41,990 --> 00:49:43,370
But how up there?

804
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,030
Up in orbit, I guess.

805
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:48,420
No.

806
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:50,120
I floated.

807
00:49:50,970 --> 00:49:51,670
You see.

808
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:53,240
That's the same thing.

809
00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:55,650
Yes. I floated in the river.

810
00:49:57,290 --> 00:49:58,410
Like a fish?

811
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:01,330
I am a fish, sadly.

812
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:03,810
What do you eat in the water?

813
00:50:04,890 --> 00:50:06,340
I eat...

814
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:07,770
my likenesses.

815
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:09,690
Like everybody else?

816
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:11,730
I'm not like that.

817
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:13,700
Yes, my love.

818
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:17,000
You're precisely like that.

819
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:18,730
Sadly?

820
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:20,110
Yes.

821
00:50:20,410 --> 00:50:21,610
Tell me about it.

822
00:50:22,230 --> 00:50:23,390
Some other time.

823
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:25,100
You're abandoning me?

824
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:26,590
I'm going away.

825
00:50:27,610 --> 00:50:28,540
I hear you.

826
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:30,690
but I don't have to read you.

827
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:34,090
Look at me carefully.

828
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:37,130
Touch.

829
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:39,950
Blood.

830
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:43,520
What's this wound?

831
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:46,120
It's my mouth.

832
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:48,070
You're can speak with that?

833
00:50:49,370 --> 00:50:50,470
I breathe

834
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:52,400
through my wounds.

835
00:50:52,890 --> 00:50:53,910
Sadly.

836
00:50:55,110 --> 00:50:56,280
Yes, my love.

837
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:59,340
That's what you say to my father.

838
00:51:00,770 --> 00:51:02,800
I know a riddle.

839
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:06,840
Your father sees a little fish.

840
00:51:07,910 --> 00:51:08,870
Your mother

841
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:10,610
is a mouth.

842
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:12,740
Your uncles have some dogs.

843
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:14,870
Who are you?

844
00:51:16,370 --> 00:51:17,560
I know that one.

845
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:19,480
The answer is:

846
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:21,230
I barely am.

847
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:24,300
Now...

848
00:51:25,010 --> 00:51:26,350
look at me.

849
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,050
Touch.

850
00:51:30,350 --> 00:51:31,100
Blood.

851
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:33,780
Drop.

852
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:36,690
I hear.

853
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,370
You're here?

854
00:51:43,490 --> 00:51:44,330
Yes.

855
00:51:45,130 --> 00:51:46,830
You're still not ready
to talk to me? Fine.

856
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:48,370
What?

857
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:54,410
I'm worried.

858
00:51:54,730 --> 00:51:55,700
I mean,

859
00:51:56,350 --> 00:51:57,510
your condition?

860
00:51:58,310 --> 00:52:00,750
And according to you,
what is my condition?

861
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:03,430
You have no close friends.

862
00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:04,420
Yes?

863
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:05,410
Not yes, wow.

864
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:08,590
And Pierre, that's wow, too?

865
00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:10,740
My love,

866
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,090
I was very afraid that my son had been...

867
00:52:15,450 --> 00:52:16,680
How should I put it?

868
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,100
Infected?

869
00:52:18,810 --> 00:52:19,750
He's wasting away.

870
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:22,430
Tonight, it struck me.

871
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:24,680
You see everything so well

872
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,370
except what's right before your eyes.

873
00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:27,750
What do you mean?

874
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:30,160
The stone.

875
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:38,440
Try to be serious for once and tell me
everything about this famous Pierre.

876
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:40,000
I'm going to.

877
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:41,120
Up there?

878
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:42,620
The reverse.

879
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:45,430
You dreamt about
undressing her with your eyes.

880
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,500
That was Pierre in my verdict.

881
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:48,990
What a joke.

882
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:50,360
Very funny.

883
00:52:51,770 --> 00:52:52,810
Don't you recognized him?

884
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:55,110
He's your son, my love.

885
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:57,710
What exactly do you mean?

886
00:52:58,650 --> 00:53:00,490
Disgusted by our love-making...

887
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:01,710
Is that right?

888
00:53:01,830 --> 00:53:02,590
Yes.

889
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:06,760
You mean to say that this Pierre...

890
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:10,300
explain yourself, right now!

891
00:53:11,510 --> 00:53:12,390
Very well.

892
00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:14,860
This morning as I was taking my shower

893
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:16,670
it happened.

894
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:29,030
You're delirious.

895
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:33,350
This Pierre comes from Brazil.

896
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:37,540
I have an object in my cocktail.

897
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:40,320
It fell out of my stomach.

898
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:42,640
Very, very funny.

899
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:45,000
At least,

900
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:47,550
she isn't anthropomorphic.

901
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:48,790
Very funny.

902
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,700
You know why I'm laughing?

903
00:53:52,870 --> 00:53:55,070
Today I contributed to knowledge.

904
00:53:56,470 --> 00:53:57,450
and they say...

905
00:54:00,330 --> 00:54:02,450
They say that explains everything.

906
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,170
You want to know?

907
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:11,830
Michel.

908
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:15,210
The time has come for you to go to sleep.

909
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,670
How sad.  I can't do it.

910
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:20,230
And can I find out why you can't?

911
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:21,530
Because.

912
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:23,680
Michel, you've going to lie down now.

913
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:25,540
I can't.

914
00:54:26,150 --> 00:54:27,500
I'm talking with my friend.

915
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:29,660
Your friend is in the book.

916
00:54:30,090 --> 00:54:30,660
Yes.

917
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:32,620
Can you see what he's doing?

918
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:35,070
Singing.

919
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:37,910
What is he singing about?

920
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:39,410
Pillage.

921
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:34,750
Is that you?

922
00:56:34,870 --> 00:56:36,260
Yes. It's me.

923
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:37,230
Where is my son?

924
00:56:37,530 --> 00:56:40,090
He came to see me, like you.

925
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:41,610
He's here?

926
00:56:41,910 --> 00:56:43,580
He's always... here.

927
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:45,630
And what is he doing?

928
00:56:45,930 --> 00:56:46,720
He's sleeping,

929
00:56:47,290 --> 00:56:48,340
like the rest.

930
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:50,250
Like the rest of the children?

931
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:51,270
Yes.

932
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:54,600
My wife is here, too?

933
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:55,450
Of course.

934
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:58,490
They noticed. They feel everything.

935
00:56:58,890 --> 00:57:01,620
They're feeling more
and more ubiquitous.

936
00:57:02,430 --> 00:57:03,120
Who?

937
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:04,620
Your two uncles.

938
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:06,610
And me?

939
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:08,450
And you....

940
00:57:09,010 --> 00:57:10,400
are the opposite

941
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:11,900
as usual.

942
00:57:13,110 --> 00:57:14,420
You sleep at your place,

943
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:17,660
and while slumbering, you
betray you wife around here?

944
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:19,780
And the monsters,

945
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:20,970
where did they go?

946
00:57:22,950 --> 00:57:24,070
Still here?

947
00:57:24,570 --> 00:57:25,660
He's sleeping.

948
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:26,940
You think so.

949
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:29,010
He doesn't sleep any more.

950
00:57:29,990 --> 00:57:31,770
You're happy with everything?

951
00:57:33,570 --> 00:57:37,370
He sees to it that I miss
nothing during his absences.

952
00:57:40,470 --> 00:57:41,750
It's getting late.

953
00:57:43,070 --> 00:57:43,840
A shame.

954
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:45,920
I'll go.

955
00:57:47,450 --> 00:57:48,680
You'll miss me.

956
00:58:06,870 --> 00:58:07,690
All right.

957
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:10,190
Right now, you must be precise.

958
00:58:11,770 --> 00:58:13,070
You're going to tell me

959
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:15,860
exactly what the two of them are.

960
00:58:16,430 --> 00:58:17,810
- Was it...
- What have I....

961
00:58:17,930 --> 00:58:19,900
No. Try to rember, would you please?

962
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:21,760
Was it right here?

963
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:23,350
A turn to the right?

964
00:58:23,470 --> 00:58:24,900
Try to remember, please!

965
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:25,940
I don't know, I...

966
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:30,180
You can't recall if it was there or to
the left or right or in this place at all?

967
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:32,840
- Not here? Here? Over there?
- The only thing I know...

968
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:36,760
What do you need to remember? It was
either here, there, over here or over there.

969
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:39,230
Easy enough to know, if you
understand a word I've said to you.

970
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:42,900
Hold on.

971
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:47,350
I sense it was here.

972
00:58:56,910 --> 00:58:58,330
You know much better,

973
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:00,930
I had to return for an examination.

974
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:05,790
Even closing my dead eyes, I have no
problems perceiving in particular.

975
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:09,810
I never knew.

976
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:13,960
Telling me to kill myself...

977
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:16,190
and the damage is done.

978
00:59:18,510 --> 00:59:19,370
To be brief,

979
00:59:19,670 --> 00:59:22,030
I'm also seeking to speak to your son.

980
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:25,580
Your son

981
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:27,490
disappeared into sleep

982
00:59:27,610 --> 00:59:30,360
of that we can't have any doubts.

983
00:59:32,210 --> 00:59:34,660
That one had eyes, too.

984
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:38,330
Sit down.

985
00:59:44,210 --> 00:59:46,100
I can be buried,

986
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:48,950
after you apply this force,

987
00:59:49,070 --> 00:59:50,950
somewhere up there.

988
00:59:51,790 --> 00:59:52,600
You know where.

989
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:55,220
You're all-wise.

990
00:59:55,650 --> 00:59:57,380
The insomniac acquires

991
00:59:57,620 --> 01:00:00,090
the infinite mass of the dreamer's body

992
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:03,590
and my Sacre de Coeur.

993
01:00:05,030 --> 01:00:07,450
And in this haze of dreams,

994
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:09,870
thick like caramel,

995
01:00:10,510 --> 01:00:12,860
the birth of your son.

996
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:15,720
And two begot him.

997
01:00:16,850 --> 01:00:18,900
Go ahead doctor, before it's too late.

998
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:28,900
Come in, doctor. Come in.

999
01:00:57,490 --> 01:00:58,760
Do you know about us?

1000
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:03,020
I've been told certain things.

1001
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:06,660
What, for example?

1002
01:01:08,170 --> 01:01:10,640
- That.
- What a boor!

1003
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:13,830
Sit down, doctor. I'll join you.

1004
01:01:14,190 --> 01:01:15,810
I may be a boor,

1005
01:01:15,930 --> 01:01:17,210
but I'm not a whore.

1006
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:19,460
Everybody could tell you what he did.

1007
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:21,650
Thus, we're in disagreement
about the entire discourse,

1008
01:01:21,770 --> 01:01:24,930
both the presuppositions and
the philosophical repercussions.

1009
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:27,730
Opens his mouth, and what does he say?

1010
01:01:28,010 --> 01:01:28,940
So

1011
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:33,610
there are things to prepare,
Marcel, to make yourself honest.

1012
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:35,690
I'm always honest.

1013
01:01:36,050 --> 01:01:38,660
Oh yes. You sure have been since
my wife has rejected you.

1014
01:01:40,150 --> 01:01:41,140
A head to head.

1015
01:01:42,090 --> 01:01:43,850
You only have one reason,
but you have two.

1016
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,780
Just wait for them to appear

1017
01:01:47,510 --> 01:01:48,750
to go to see the Doctor.

1018
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:50,850
I think I'll have to
use force with this guy.

1019
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:52,950
Thinks he's...

1020
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:56,340
Yes. Better be careful. Isn't he charming?

1021
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:57,640
I am certain of that.

1022
01:01:58,250 --> 01:02:00,190
I'm delighted by you, Doctor.

1023
01:02:00,310 --> 01:02:02,020
Just before it happened,

1024
01:02:02,140 --> 01:02:05,530
I said to Marcel, aren't you taking
things a little bit too fast?

1025
01:02:05,970 --> 01:02:09,590
In fact, this place is haunted.

1026
01:02:10,550 --> 01:02:12,110
But I sense that he needs to be

1027
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:13,780
convinced.

1028
01:02:16,070 --> 01:02:16,740
Professor,

1029
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:18,290
I have little time.

1030
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,130
I'm looking for my son.

1031
01:02:20,390 --> 01:02:22,500
Stay a bit longer and you'll
decide you like it around here.

1032
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:26,420
You see, according to Marcel, finding
son is nothing but chimerical.

1033
01:02:27,070 --> 01:02:29,990
Seeing a chimera is not
impossible, the chimera itrself,

1034
01:02:31,030 --> 01:02:32,320
that's another thing.

1035
01:02:33,010 --> 01:02:34,870
Around here, you have to laugh, Doctor.

1036
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:37,810
Yes, indeed.

1037
01:02:38,090 --> 01:02:39,530
His manner is very funny.

1038
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:42,170
Violette.

1039
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:44,100
The beautiful Violette.

1040
01:02:52,190 --> 01:02:53,680
I'm scared stiff.

1041
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:54,580
Don't leave!

1042
01:02:55,890 --> 01:02:58,230
All for nothing. Nothing, Doctor!

1043
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:01,840
You son has been found. He's already
on his way.  Just a few minutes.

1044
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:03,280
What's that?

1045
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:05,610
It's necessary to

1046
01:03:06,010 --> 01:03:07,860
employ your knowledge,

1047
01:03:09,170 --> 01:03:10,860
once and for all.

1048
01:03:12,370 --> 01:03:14,060
Isn't that so, Alain?

1049
01:03:14,180 --> 01:03:15,560
To know what?

1050
01:03:16,030 --> 01:03:17,430
That's she's a whore.

1051
01:03:17,550 --> 01:03:20,180
Marcel. One doesn't speak of whores.

1052
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:21,650
That's too obvious.

1053
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:23,190
You see, Doctor,

1054
01:03:24,230 --> 01:03:27,460
Concerning people, no one
wonders since solipsism exists.

1055
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:31,180
How can he tell the whole
that that it isn't solipsistic?

1056
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:33,140
Alain

1057
01:03:33,870 --> 01:03:35,170
was my husband.

1058
01:03:37,070 --> 01:03:37,810
Wait.

1059
01:03:37,930 --> 01:03:38,990
Your husband?

1060
01:03:39,290 --> 01:03:40,590
This means she was a family whore.

1061
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:42,150
He was my husband,

1062
01:03:43,340 --> 01:03:45,090
but I didn't love him that way.

1063
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:48,190
Now,

1064
01:03:49,630 --> 01:03:50,600
I believe

1065
01:03:52,150 --> 01:03:53,310
that I love him.

1066
01:03:54,670 --> 01:03:56,430
What are these words of yours?
She wants to settle accounts.

1067
01:03:56,940 --> 01:03:59,240
She goes and tells you
now that it's too late.

1068
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:01,970
Do you understand this
tragic situation, Marcel?

1069
01:04:02,090 --> 01:04:03,140
Even so, Doctor,

1070
01:04:03,260 --> 01:04:05,780
that's just what I was doing on
the bridge to your wife and hard.

1071
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:08,950
Oh, no.  Marcel!
Not hard. Not like that.

1072
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:14,280
I remind myself of nothing.

1073
01:04:15,580 --> 01:04:17,000
I remember nothing

1074
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:18,900
Talk, Marcel.

1075
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:20,650
It seems I'm being
recognized once again.

1076
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,190
But I live with myself.

1077
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:24,140
That's dementia talking.

1078
01:04:24,930 --> 01:04:25,610
Talk!

1079
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:27,810
Telling me what? To obey that one?

1080
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:34,200
She's given that away.

1081
01:04:34,870 --> 01:04:35,940
It's begun.

1082
01:04:36,060 --> 01:04:37,520
It's all for the best!

1083
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:39,970
Antoine,

1084
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:41,590
in one verb:

1085
01:04:41,860 --> 01:04:42,990
Sleep!

1086
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:43,870
Quick!

1087
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:46,390
Thanks for the hand.

1088
01:04:53,290 --> 01:04:54,030
Alain.

1089
01:04:55,830 --> 01:04:57,460
I'm here.

1090
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:00,460
Where is my son?

1091
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:02,520
I'm looking for him

1092
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:04,460
like you.

1093
01:05:06,250 --> 01:05:07,350
It's more of the same.

1094
01:05:08,540 --> 01:05:09,460
He's waiting for you?

1095
01:05:12,110 --> 01:05:14,240
Have you told him I was wicked?

1096
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:15,560
Yes.

1097
01:05:17,420 --> 01:05:19,490
Have you told him
that you are strong-willed?

1098
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:23,700
I read your letters to him
and he heard everything.

1099
01:05:27,390 --> 01:05:29,080
So he must loathe me.

1100
01:05:34,390 --> 01:05:35,440
I adore you.

1101
01:05:37,420 --> 01:05:38,480
And yourself?

1102
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:42,790
Come back.

1103
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:48,360
Good morning, papa.

1104
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:50,660
Where are you?

1105
01:05:51,290 --> 01:05:52,070
Here,

1106
01:05:52,650 --> 01:05:53,590
with mama.

1107
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:56,970
You're dead?

1108
01:05:58,210 --> 01:05:59,670
No. You're living.

1109
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:02,510
What's the difference?

1110
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:05,350
Michel, don't twist words.

1111
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:08,220
It's very different being dead.

1112
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:11,760
As a doctor, I'm in
a good position to know.

1113
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:15,550
Fine. If that's what you want.

1114
01:06:15,950 --> 01:06:17,050
I'm alive.

1115
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:19,930
Where?

1116
01:06:20,050 --> 01:06:20,920
Here.

1117
01:06:23,620 --> 01:06:24,600
You're here?

1118
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:25,970
Yes.

1119
01:06:26,810 --> 01:06:28,030
With your mother?

1120
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:28,840
Yes.

1121
01:06:30,030 --> 01:06:30,820
And...

1122
01:06:31,090 --> 01:06:33,040
what are you doing together?

1123
01:06:35,870 --> 01:06:37,250
Do you still love your mother?

1124
01:06:38,890 --> 01:06:39,520
Yes mama.

1125
01:06:40,550 --> 01:06:41,510
I'll always loved you.

1126
01:06:42,550 --> 01:06:43,250
And you?

1127
01:06:43,860 --> 01:06:44,790
Me?

1128
01:06:45,810 --> 01:06:47,180
I couldn't do otherwise.

1129
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:48,720
You are my son.

1130
01:06:49,850 --> 01:06:50,710
Michel.

1131
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:52,600
Answer me.

1132
01:06:54,110 --> 01:06:56,440
You must love your father, too.

1133
01:06:59,190 --> 01:07:00,820
I believe that
as soon as I wake up

1134
01:07:02,220 --> 01:07:03,690
he's going to beat me.

1135
01:07:05,970 --> 01:07:07,260
He is both of yours.

1136
01:07:09,620 --> 01:07:11,570
I don't like needing this father.

1137
01:07:12,490 --> 01:07:14,790
It's like being hidden
from only one person.

1138
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:16,980
You know, mama,

1139
01:07:17,580 --> 01:07:19,990
I've heard that my fathers
are Antoine and Marcel.

1140
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:22,630
Yes.

1141
01:07:23,170 --> 01:07:25,040
Make away, I'd ought.

1142
01:07:26,220 --> 01:07:27,490
Make away from me?

1143
01:07:29,630 --> 01:07:30,720
Go away.

1144
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:35,210
Can I stay with you?

1145
01:07:36,940 --> 01:07:38,320
Go away.

1146
01:07:39,810 --> 01:07:41,690
I could show my affection
before I go.

1147
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:45,850
No.

1148
01:07:46,550 --> 01:07:47,370
Why?

1149
01:07:50,470 --> 01:07:53,070
Because I've just done my makeup.

1150
01:07:55,090 --> 01:07:57,350
I could at least blow you a kiss.

1151
01:08:47,510 --> 01:08:49,740
You didn't even get dressed?

1152
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:52,880
No.

1153
01:08:53,770 --> 01:08:55,210
Why should I?

1154
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:57,780
I've said I spent all day in bed.

1155
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:01,000
Who goes out any way?

1156
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:05,880
You always stay shut up.

1157
01:09:07,770 --> 01:09:08,910
Don't you want to go out?

1158
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:15,210
No.

1159
01:09:15,430 --> 01:09:16,610
You're mistaken.

1160
01:09:17,430 --> 01:09:18,770
I'm almost never here.

1161
01:09:19,980 --> 01:09:21,350
I'm always with them.

1162
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:27,310
And at this moment you're with them?

1163
01:09:27,430 --> 01:09:28,500
Yes.

1164
01:09:37,430 --> 01:09:40,220
I'm beginning to feel guilty
for having eaten those pancakes.

1165
01:09:41,250 --> 01:09:43,260
Have you found the disappeared one?

1166
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:45,720
I'm only breathing thanks
to this freezing air.

1167
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:48,160
Knock yourself out.

1168
01:09:48,570 --> 01:09:49,770
That would please me.

1169
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:52,720
Let's go for something eat after all.

1170
01:09:53,110 --> 01:09:56,440
Thus, I ask you what has
given you this guilty feeling?

1171
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:59,360
That's why man's heart
is seized by sadness.

1172
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:00,750
Do tell.

1173
01:10:00,870 --> 01:10:02,330
I'm getting hungry.

1174
01:10:02,860 --> 01:10:04,100
Have you woken up yet?

1175
01:10:05,930 --> 01:10:06,780
A little.

1176
01:10:07,510 --> 01:10:08,690
Since when?

1177
01:10:10,910 --> 01:10:12,740
Dreams are full of wounds.

1178
01:10:14,020 --> 01:10:15,670
How unfair!

1179
01:10:16,930 --> 01:10:19,720
We fall asleep before we've woken up.

1180
01:10:20,230 --> 01:10:23,210
I'm certain that, today, the laws
of the heart can be determined.

1181
01:10:24,780 --> 01:10:26,740
That's fine. I want to have
been something before

1182
01:10:26,860 --> 01:10:28,260
you go crazy with sleep.

1183
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:31,430
A triumphal arch for the son.

1184
01:10:31,550 --> 01:10:33,340
Yes. It should have been Oedipus.

1185
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:34,780
I should.

1186
01:10:48,970 --> 01:10:49,800
Sleep!

1187
01:11:08,730 --> 01:11:10,360
Oh... no, no, no, no.

1188
01:11:11,220 --> 01:11:11,770
Yes.

1189
01:11:12,210 --> 01:11:13,640
- No!
- Yes. Just this once.

1190
01:11:17,770 --> 01:11:19,140
I have taken down your confession.

1191
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:20,880
Let's go and have a nice coffee.

1192
01:11:23,540 --> 01:11:25,900
It feels like pretty soon,
it's going to snow.

1193
01:11:26,990 --> 01:11:28,470
There are other bridges to attend to.

1194
01:11:28,910 --> 01:11:30,050
And other children.

1195
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:32,070
Marcel.

1196
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:35,070
Marcel, never forget
what I'm about to tell you,

1197
01:11:36,180 --> 01:11:38,690
and nevermore will a child be begotten.

1198
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:39,800
But why?

1199
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:43,090
Disappearing the family father will suffice

1200
01:11:43,210 --> 01:11:44,240
to render a few hours very nice.

1201
01:13:00,630 --> 01:13:03,570
