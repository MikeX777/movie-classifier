Hi! Come on in.

00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:40,475
You want something? Coffee?

00:02:43,183 --> 00:02:47,017

00:02:50,725 --> 00:02:56,392

Coffee? Tea?

00:02:59,517 --> 00:03:02,517

Just a moment.

00:03:35,142 --> 00:03:37,892
Thank you.
- Fongtron?

15
00:03:38,142 --> 00:03:39,767
Yes, Mister Fongtron.

16
00:03:39,975 --> 00:03:43,058
Sorry, no Chinese people here.

17
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,267
Levi.
- Levi?

18
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,683
There are Chinese people...

19
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:50,350
Japanese and Chinese are there.

20
00:03:50,558 --> 00:03:53,767
But no Fongtron?
- I don't know.

21
00:04:09,433 --> 00:04:12,142
You know Mister Fongtron?
- Fon...

22
00:04:12,308 --> 00:04:13,642
Fongtron.

23
00:04:15,183 --> 00:04:16,683
No.

24
00:04:23,433 --> 00:04:25,225
You know Mister Fongtron?

25
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:36,933
You know Mister Fongtron?

26
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,142
Drink it.

27
00:04:58,642 --> 00:05:00,725
Hi.
- Jello!

28
00:05:00,975 --> 00:05:03,725
Why don't you fix me a plate?

29
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,142
Is there room at your table?
- As always.

30
00:05:27,642 --> 00:05:31,433
Here you go.
- Thank you.

31
00:05:43,725 --> 00:05:45,642
I look Fongtron.

32
00:05:45,808 --> 00:05:47,892
Do you know Fongtron?

33
00:05:49,642 --> 00:05:51,142
Fong?
- ...tron.

34
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:52,642
Fongtron.

35
00:05:52,933 --> 00:05:54,933
What does he want?
- I don't know.

36
00:05:55,017 --> 00:05:56,558
He asked me the same thing.

37
00:05:57,142 --> 00:05:58,767
Sirkka!

38
00:05:59,017 --> 00:06:01,933
I think this guy wants to know
something.

39
00:06:02,183 --> 00:06:05,392
He's looking for somebody. I think.

40
00:06:05,517 --> 00:06:08,225
Mister Fongtron.
- Fongtron...

41
00:06:08,392 --> 00:06:11,642
Pohopoki.
- Pohopoki?

42
00:06:17,767 --> 00:06:20,433
That's Levi, right?
- Yes.

43
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,475
What's that?

44
00:06:23,808 --> 00:06:25,725
Pohjanjoki.
- That's right.

45
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:28,433
It's Pohjanjoki!

46
00:06:28,558 --> 00:06:32,308
Pojopoki?
- Pohjanjoki. Pohjanjoki.

47
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,975
Pohjanjoki. Fongtron?
- No, no.

48
00:06:35,142 --> 00:06:38,642
No here live. No live here.
- No, we don't know.

49
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:41,892
No, no.
- But Pohjanjoki...

50
00:06:42,767 --> 00:06:44,392
I thank you.

51
00:06:55,142 --> 00:06:58,267
Pohjanjoki.
- Pojopoki.

52
00:06:58,433 --> 00:07:01,392
Pohjanjoki.
- Pohjanjoki?

53
00:07:01,642 --> 00:07:04,517
Pohjanjoki.
- Hongajoki?

54
00:07:16,183 --> 00:07:18,017
You're finished?

55
00:07:19,683 --> 00:07:21,558
I'll take the buffet away.

56
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,475
You want something?

57
00:07:24,933 --> 00:07:28,308
Food? You're hungry?
- Oh.

58
00:07:28,517 --> 00:07:30,558
You hungry, Niu Niu?

59
00:07:33,433 --> 00:07:35,350
Yeah? Mashed potatoes.

60
00:07:35,892 --> 00:07:37,933
Sausage sauce.
- Okay.

61
00:07:38,308 --> 00:07:40,350
Two?
- Yes.

62
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:55,100
Vegetable?
- Yes.

63
00:08:01,808 --> 00:08:03,267
Here you go.

64
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,725
Finnish vegetable: sausage.

65
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,683
Eat.

66
00:08:24,142 --> 00:08:27,433
Enjoy your meal.
Good appetite.

67
00:08:29,267 --> 00:08:32,517
Good day. Good day.
- Yes.

68
00:08:49,017 --> 00:08:51,017
Okay, don't eat it then.

69
00:09:36,808 --> 00:09:39,558
I'll lock now. Closed. Closed.

70
00:09:40,433 --> 00:09:41,517
Oh.

71
00:09:45,433 --> 00:09:49,392
Poyopoki any hotel?
- No, only in Levi.

72
00:09:49,558 --> 00:09:51,725
Forty kilometers.
- Okay.

73
00:09:53,017 --> 00:09:55,392
Let's go. Take your bag.

74
00:09:56,725 --> 00:09:58,392
I know a room.

75
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:02,975
Not a hotel. Room. Okay?

76
00:10:03,183 --> 00:10:05,933
Okay. Okay.

77
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,683
Let's go.

78
00:10:27,975 --> 00:10:30,808
You take this bed,
and I take that bed.

79
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,725
Let's unpack our suitcase.

80
00:10:43,475 --> 00:10:44,642
Niu Niu?

81
00:10:45,808 --> 00:10:47,683
Can you stop playing a moment?

82
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,642
Come here.

83
00:10:52,642 --> 00:10:54,267
Make your bed.

84
00:12:57,017 --> 00:12:58,975
Here you go.
- Thank you.

85
00:13:27,183 --> 00:13:28,975
Wow, that's big.

86
00:13:39,017 --> 00:13:40,225
Take this.

87
00:13:41,642 --> 00:13:43,600
I'll eat at the diner.

88
00:14:13,267 --> 00:14:14,767
Niu Niu.

89
00:14:18,892 --> 00:14:20,392
Niu Niu.

90
00:14:22,642 --> 00:14:24,142
Can you stop playing
with your phone?

91
00:14:24,558 --> 00:14:26,517
What else is there to do here?

92
00:14:33,975 --> 00:14:36,892
It was gravel,
and it was an island.

93
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:40,308
Every hole we drilled,
we got salt water.

94
00:14:40,475 --> 00:14:43,100
That's right.
You won't find water in gravel.

95
00:14:43,475 --> 00:14:45,100
Howdy.
- Hi.

96
00:14:46,433 --> 00:14:50,058
I drilled seven holes
before they said it's enough.

97
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:55,433
They won't find drinking water there.
- No, not in the gravel.

98
00:14:56,558 --> 00:14:59,642
The deepest hole I've drilled
is over 200 meters.

99
00:14:59,975 --> 00:15:03,850
Then I found water. A lot of it.

100
00:15:06,267 --> 00:15:09,600
I'm sorry. Can you help?

101
00:15:10,183 --> 00:15:11,892
Ask Fongtron.

102
00:15:14,392 --> 00:15:15,683
Guys.

103
00:15:16,767 --> 00:15:19,683
There's this foreigner
who's asking me to ask you -

104
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:22,058
if you know
a person named Fongtron.

105
00:15:23,267 --> 00:15:25,975
Never heard.
- Fong what?

106
00:15:26,183 --> 00:15:28,642
Fongtron? Isn't it that company?

107
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:31,225
They make pressure vessels
in Tampere.

108
00:15:32,392 --> 00:15:35,892
Pressure vessels?
- Yeah, the company is in Tampere.

109
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:43,642
It makes pressure vessels
in Tampere.

110
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:49,850
Makes pressure things in Tampere.

111
00:15:51,808 --> 00:15:53,475
I'm sorry.

112
00:15:57,267 --> 00:16:01,183
Your CRP level is 600,
so the infection is severe.

113
00:16:01,392 --> 00:16:05,475
Your hemoglobin is low.
Your sed rate is high.

114
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:08,642
I have to up your dosage.

115
00:16:14,183 --> 00:16:17,183
Right. Goodbye.

116
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,600
Did the alternator belt snap?
- No, the cooler. The light is on.

117
00:16:29,767 --> 00:16:32,142
Is it leaking?
- Yeah.

118
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,517
I have to call the repair shop.

119
00:16:34,683 --> 00:16:36,892
Hi.
- Hello.

120
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,642
Are they hungry? We have food.

121
00:16:39,808 --> 00:16:42,975
Tourists are usually picky.
But you can go ask them.

122
00:16:43,142 --> 00:16:45,350
Where are they from?
- China.

123
00:17:11,975 --> 00:17:14,558
So how is the food here?
- It's good.

124
00:17:16,142 --> 00:17:20,016
So, I have this nakki. Sausage.

125
00:17:20,475 --> 00:17:24,225
And potatoes. Soft potatoes.
Mashed potatoes.

126
00:17:24,391 --> 00:17:26,808
And then raastepöytä.

127
00:17:41,766 --> 00:17:43,517
You have no sushi? Sushi?

128
00:17:43,767 --> 00:17:46,392
It seems they don't like it.
You just have this?

129
00:17:46,517 --> 00:17:49,183
No, I don't have sushi.

130
00:17:49,392 --> 00:17:53,183
I only have
this potato and sausage -

131
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:56,558
and that raaste...
I'm sorry.

132
00:17:56,683 --> 00:17:59,642
They only have sausages and
mashed potatoes. - I can help.

133
00:18:01,892 --> 00:18:03,975
Hello everyone. I'm Cheng.

134
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,475
Nice to meet you.
I'm their tourist guide.

135
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,767
Basically,
they only have this food here,

136
00:18:09,892 --> 00:18:12,475
but if you want to have
Chinese food,

137
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,892
I can cook you noodles.

138
00:18:17,725 --> 00:18:20,267
How about chicken noodles?

139
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,808
Please take a seat.

140
00:18:27,558 --> 00:18:30,267
And noodles.
You take ten. Ten packs.

141
00:18:30,433 --> 00:18:33,433
Noodles? Noodles.

142
00:18:33,642 --> 00:18:36,058
You have chicken?
- Yes, here.

143
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,058
We take all.

144
00:18:39,225 --> 00:18:41,433
What did he say?
- He'll take it all.

145
00:18:53,683 --> 00:18:56,933
Put everything on my account.
- Sure.

146
00:18:57,725 --> 00:19:01,100
I'll pay you as soon as I can.
- I know you will.

147
00:19:16,642 --> 00:19:21,267
That looks slimy and awful.
- It could be delicious.

148
00:19:21,975 --> 00:19:23,725
I doubt it.

149
00:19:24,058 --> 00:19:26,767
A white heterosexual man
won't eat that.

150
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:30,892
Are you a white heterosexual man?
- Don't you start with me.

151
00:19:34,892 --> 00:19:36,892
Oh shit.
- What?

152
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,767
The amount of pills
just keeps growing.

153
00:19:40,058 --> 00:19:42,642
I'll stay young and healthy.
- Right.

154
00:19:45,725 --> 00:19:47,392
Well, well.

155
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:54,142
Look who's talking.

156
00:20:22,392 --> 00:20:24,017
The food's delicious.

157
00:20:24,142 --> 00:20:27,267
I'll tell my colleagues
about your place. - Thank you.

158
00:20:34,183 --> 00:20:37,308
80, 90.

159
00:20:38,517 --> 00:20:40,142
310.

160
00:20:40,308 --> 00:20:44,433
320, 330, 340.

161
00:20:44,558 --> 00:20:46,392
350.

162
00:20:48,183 --> 00:20:51,392
Today was the best day ever.
Best day ever.

163
00:20:51,517 --> 00:20:52,850
Good business.

164
00:20:56,142 --> 00:20:59,100
Hey, thanks a lot. Thank you.

165
00:20:59,267 --> 00:21:01,267
Oh. Thank you very much.

166
00:21:01,475 --> 00:21:04,392
No need. No need.
- You work hard. This is yours.

167
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:07,683
No. I cook, you happy.

168
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:10,892
The Chinese people happy.
Everybody happy.

169
00:21:20,475 --> 00:21:23,767
You're a cook?
- Yes, professional.

170
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,392
Restaurant in Shanghai.

171
00:21:27,808 --> 00:21:29,933
A good one.
- Must be.

172
00:21:32,975 --> 00:21:35,767
I'm Cheng.
- Sirkka.

173
00:21:36,392 --> 00:21:37,975
Srikka?
- Sirkka.

174
00:21:38,183 --> 00:21:40,392
Sirkka. Nice to meet you.

175
00:21:40,517 --> 00:21:42,142
Nice to meet you.

176
00:21:45,808 --> 00:21:46,808
We clean?

177
00:21:47,683 --> 00:21:50,683
I do it. I do it.
- We can. We can.

178
00:21:51,308 --> 00:21:53,600
Everything okay with your son?

179
00:21:54,225 --> 00:21:57,183
Yes.
- He looks lonely.

180
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,975
Hey, come. Come.

181
00:22:06,933 --> 00:22:10,475
You need to do something.
- I'm not a sportsman.

182
00:22:10,725 --> 00:22:13,017
Go and play with your son.

183
00:22:20,308 --> 00:22:21,600
No.

184
00:22:30,892 --> 00:22:33,017
I'm paying back part of my debt.

185
00:22:34,142 --> 00:22:38,142
750.
- Wow.

186
00:22:39,933 --> 00:22:45,100
Come on. What's going on?
You're not kicking.

187
00:22:45,225 --> 00:22:47,475
Again, harder.

188
00:22:48,725 --> 00:22:50,142
Come on.

189
00:22:55,308 --> 00:22:58,017
Not bad. Again.

190
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:37,058
Niu Niu.

191
00:23:38,308 --> 00:23:39,725
Turn the lights off.

192
00:23:39,933 --> 00:23:41,475
You turn them off.

193
00:23:50,267 --> 00:23:54,142
Turn the volume down.
- Okay.

194
00:24:14,058 --> 00:24:17,058
I'm looking for the number
of a company called Fongtron.

195
00:24:17,183 --> 00:24:18,558
In Tampere.

196
00:24:18,933 --> 00:24:20,267
Yeah.

197
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:23,683
No, Fongtron.

198
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:28,350
Oh, okay.

199
00:24:28,642 --> 00:24:31,142
That's okay. Thanks.

200
00:26:35,017 --> 00:26:36,642
Today I cook.

201
00:26:36,808 --> 00:26:39,808
You? Why?
- The tourists come back.

202
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:43,058
Really? How do you know?
- I asked them.

203
00:26:44,975 --> 00:26:47,850
You're a good businessman.
- Just a cook.

204
00:26:48,808 --> 00:26:52,100
But I need some more materials.

205
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:55,058
Salad, vegetables, chicken.

206
00:26:55,225 --> 00:26:58,392
You have in shop?
- No, nothing left from yesterday.

207
00:26:58,642 --> 00:27:00,517
They only come once a week.

208
00:27:01,142 --> 00:27:04,225
Only in Levi. Thirty minutes.

209
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:07,517
Let's go.

210
00:27:27,267 --> 00:27:28,600
Look.

211
00:27:29,058 --> 00:27:30,308
Reindeer.

212
00:27:30,808 --> 00:27:33,058
Look. Niu Niu, take a photo.

213
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:36,017
They're delicious.

214
00:27:36,433 --> 00:27:39,183
You eat them?
- Yeah, of course.

215
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:52,683
Look, there's a Chinese restaurant.
- Yes.

216
00:27:52,808 --> 00:27:55,558
Do you want to eat?
- Yes.

217
00:27:55,725 --> 00:27:59,433
I can check it out for you if you want?
- Er...

218
00:28:00,808 --> 00:28:02,642
Look.

219
00:28:27,475 --> 00:28:28,975
Dad, come here.

220
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:42,933
Take it.

221
00:29:10,225 --> 00:29:12,475
Me?
- Yes, your turn.

222
00:29:14,225 --> 00:29:15,558
Okay.

223
00:29:16,225 --> 00:29:18,808
Just cut it this way,

224
00:29:18,892 --> 00:29:21,975
this way and then this.
- Okay.

225
00:30:29,558 --> 00:30:31,392
People happy important.

226
00:30:31,892 --> 00:30:33,683
Good food make happy.

227
00:30:33,892 --> 00:30:36,350
Important.
- Yeah.

228
00:30:37,017 --> 00:30:38,308
Happy.

229
00:30:41,642 --> 00:30:43,308
That's important.

230
00:31:01,725 --> 00:31:04,183
All the customers are gone?
- Yeah.

231
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:06,975
You're welcome back anytime.

232
00:31:07,183 --> 00:31:11,392
Spread the word.
- I will. "Wooord."

233
00:31:17,142 --> 00:31:19,142
Looks like you had a full house.

234
00:31:19,308 --> 00:31:21,933
You have anything left for us?
- Sure.

235
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:37,642
Here you are.
- This looks exotic.

236
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:39,933
Sometimes
you have to try new things.

237
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:44,725
Tell me, does the name Fongtron
ring a bell?

238
00:31:45,475 --> 00:31:49,100
A friend is looking for him.
- Sounds like a drug dealer.

239
00:31:49,308 --> 00:31:53,808
Or a human smuggler.
- Who is this Fongtron?

240
00:31:54,433 --> 00:31:56,267
Forget about it.

241
00:31:57,433 --> 00:31:58,850
It just crossed my mind.

242
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,683
Fongtron. - Let's check
if there's an APB out on him.

243
00:32:03,808 --> 00:32:05,058
All right.

244
00:32:07,933 --> 00:32:09,642
Delicious.
- It sure is.

245
00:32:12,433 --> 00:32:14,392
First you spit on the worm.

246
00:32:16,433 --> 00:32:18,392
And then you throw it
in the water.

247
00:32:24,558 --> 00:32:26,350
The water clean?

248
00:32:38,683 --> 00:32:39,850
That's good.

249
00:32:40,183 --> 00:32:43,933
I can cook a very delicious soup.

250
00:32:44,142 --> 00:32:45,767
It can heal people.

251
00:32:45,933 --> 00:32:47,808
Heal?
- Yes.

252
00:32:48,017 --> 00:32:50,017
Chinese food can, sometimes.

253
00:32:50,725 --> 00:32:51,975
Okay.

254
00:32:53,892 --> 00:32:55,517
You wanna try?

255
00:33:03,892 --> 00:33:05,892
Cheng.
- Yes?

256
00:33:06,392 --> 00:33:09,808
You don't smuggle human?

257
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:17,433
I cook. Professional cook.

258
00:33:19,225 --> 00:33:20,850
I guess you are.

259
00:33:21,017 --> 00:33:23,392
Sorry?
- Nothing.

260
00:33:28,683 --> 00:33:32,392
Cheng, if you cannot find Fongtron,
what do you do?

261
00:33:37,308 --> 00:33:39,100
I will find him.

262
00:33:40,058 --> 00:33:42,142
Fongtron is important.

263
00:33:49,975 --> 00:33:51,475
Your room.

264
00:33:54,308 --> 00:33:56,808
You can stay as long
as you want to.

265
00:33:57,308 --> 00:33:58,600
Thank you.

266
00:34:00,558 --> 00:34:02,017
Hey, it's eating!

267
00:34:02,475 --> 00:34:04,017
It's biting!
- Niu Niu!

268
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,058
We're getting bites!

269
00:34:05,183 --> 00:34:06,267
Come here.

270
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:12,183
It's coming up. Good!

271
00:34:13,808 --> 00:34:15,142
It's a big one.

272
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,892
Jello.
- Hi.

273
00:35:23,517 --> 00:35:28,308
According to the Shit Shoveling
Workers' Union, it's lunchtime.

274
00:35:29,808 --> 00:35:31,892
What? Where's the grub?

275
00:35:32,517 --> 00:35:36,642
Today we have perch soup
Chinese style.

276
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,850
Are you seriously suggesting -

277
00:35:38,975 --> 00:35:41,850
that a handsome
heterosexual Finnish man like me -

278
00:35:42,017 --> 00:35:44,308
would voluntarily eat Chinese food?

279
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:47,350
I can warm mashed potatoes
and sausages for you.

280
00:35:52,725 --> 00:35:54,767
Is that real perch?

281
00:35:55,058 --> 00:35:59,058
Finnish perch?
- From our lake.

282
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:05,183
Because my motto is
"Live dangerously,"

283
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:10,308
give me a portion of
that Chinese perch soup.

284
00:36:16,017 --> 00:36:20,017
So, that's it, huh?
- It's hot.

285
00:36:20,267 --> 00:36:23,475
The chef said the soup can heal.

286
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,933
Heal what?

287
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:28,892
You'll become
more and more hetero each day.

288
00:36:29,017 --> 00:36:31,017
Be quiet.

289
00:36:43,642 --> 00:36:46,183
This is delicious.
Really delicious.

290
00:36:46,308 --> 00:36:48,767
Huh?
- Yes, this is really delicious.

291
00:36:57,642 --> 00:36:59,058
Niu Niu.

292
00:37:00,475 --> 00:37:03,225
Stop playing and come help me.

293
00:37:09,392 --> 00:37:12,183
Get up and get in there.

294
00:37:15,475 --> 00:37:17,100
I want my phone back.

295
00:37:25,058 --> 00:37:26,725
Everything okay?

296
00:37:29,433 --> 00:37:33,392
Something to eat?
- No. Go home.

297
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,225
Sirkka's Diner, Sirkka speaking.

298
00:38:45,683 --> 00:38:46,642
Yes.

299
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:53,600
Listen. Can you write me a menu?

300
00:38:54,308 --> 00:38:56,225
We can get more tourists coming.

301
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:58,308
The tourist guide has spoken
to his boss.

302
00:38:58,475 --> 00:39:00,100
Menu?
- Lunch.

303
00:39:00,225 --> 00:39:02,225
Everything Chinese?

304
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:04,517
We make a deal.

305
00:39:04,767 --> 00:39:08,975
You help me cook,
and I help you find Fongtron.

306
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:12,558
Okay.

307
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:16,142
We'll find Fongtron
in a haystack if we have to.

308
00:39:18,683 --> 00:39:21,017
Fongtron in a hashtag?

309
00:40:29,475 --> 00:40:33,100
Sirkka. Where is Niu Niu?

310
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,225
Went home.

311
00:40:49,267 --> 00:40:50,683
Niu Niu.

312
00:41:45,017 --> 00:41:46,517
Niu Niu!

313
00:42:10,683 --> 00:42:12,475
We have to call the police.

314
00:42:25,892 --> 00:42:27,183
It's him.

315
00:42:33,933 --> 00:42:36,017
I found him in the hills.

316
00:42:36,142 --> 00:42:38,850
I was looking for blueberries,
and he was there.

317
00:42:40,517 --> 00:42:41,933
What's wrong with you?

318
00:42:44,683 --> 00:42:46,142
Where have you been?

319
00:42:46,475 --> 00:42:48,725
He was in the woods.

320
00:42:48,975 --> 00:42:51,058
It's great that
Romppainen found him.

321
00:42:56,892 --> 00:42:58,183
Does it hurt?

322
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,850
Come.

323
00:43:28,267 --> 00:43:30,725
I wonder what he's all about.

324
00:43:33,183 --> 00:43:35,725
And who is Fongtron?

325
00:43:37,225 --> 00:43:38,850
I have no clue.

326
00:43:40,225 --> 00:43:42,350
I wonder if he even exists.

327
00:43:45,308 --> 00:43:48,767
And is the boy his son?

328
00:43:50,975 --> 00:43:53,100
Where's the boy's mother?

329
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:55,725
I haven't asked.

330
00:43:57,933 --> 00:43:59,725
Shouldn't you?

331
00:44:09,225 --> 00:44:12,683
I'm sorry. I've been selfish.

332
00:44:15,933 --> 00:44:21,058
I wanna go home.
Mom must be waiting for us.

333
00:44:24,183 --> 00:44:26,267
Mom isn't waiting at home.

334
00:44:27,808 --> 00:44:29,433
You have to believe me.

335
00:44:30,767 --> 00:44:32,517
Mom is here with us, here.

336
00:44:37,642 --> 00:44:39,725
We have to stay strong.

337
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:45,600
Okay, let's sleep.

338
00:45:06,183 --> 00:45:09,142
Where are we going?
- This way.

339
00:45:37,308 --> 00:45:40,267
I didn't know
there was so much space.

340
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:46,058
Yes. We look so tiny
in this huge space.

341
00:46:20,183 --> 00:46:21,642
What are you doing?

342
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,142
What's that?

343
00:46:36,642 --> 00:46:40,142
Your mom and I bought these
when we got engaged.

344
00:47:23,725 --> 00:47:24,850
Good.

345
00:47:26,392 --> 00:47:29,725
Now we've given them
to Mom.

346
00:47:30,683 --> 00:47:32,642
Mom's not here.

347
00:47:40,683 --> 00:47:42,183
Don't cry.

348
00:47:44,058 --> 00:47:45,183
True.

349
00:47:45,933 --> 00:47:47,558
Mom's not there,

350
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:50,975
but Mom stays inside your heart.

351
00:47:53,225 --> 00:47:54,392
Okay?

352
00:48:28,517 --> 00:48:29,642
Cheng.

353
00:48:30,642 --> 00:48:32,100
Ni hao.
- Ni hao.

354
00:48:32,308 --> 00:48:33,600
Ni hao.

355
00:48:37,475 --> 00:48:40,933
A hockey player named Jani.
- A hockey player named Jani?

356
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:44,183
Nine letters for a hockey player
named Jani. - Forsström.

357
00:48:45,558 --> 00:48:48,725
Forsström? Nailed it.

358
00:48:48,933 --> 00:48:52,183
Yes! Fongtron. Fongtron.

359
00:48:52,308 --> 00:48:54,142
Fongtron.

360
00:48:55,517 --> 00:49:00,350
Listen.
Could Forsström be Fongtron?

361
00:49:00,517 --> 00:49:02,767
Fongzon.
- Forsström.

362
00:49:02,933 --> 00:49:06,392
Yes! Pohopoki, Fongtron.

363
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,142
Cheng.

364
00:49:12,392 --> 00:49:14,767
I have bad news for you.

365
00:49:15,225 --> 00:49:18,183
I have some bad news for you.

366
00:49:22,475 --> 00:49:24,767
He like my food.

367
00:49:26,683 --> 00:49:30,850
He come to my restaurant
every day and order the fish soup.

368
00:49:31,517 --> 00:49:33,600
I can believe that.

369
00:49:34,058 --> 00:49:37,517
And he help me when I'm in trouble.

370
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:40,058
What kind of trouble?

371
00:49:43,058 --> 00:49:44,892
Very big trouble.

372
00:49:47,517 --> 00:49:51,517
I just know he live in Finland.

373
00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:54,392
Po... Po...
- Pohjanjoki.

374
00:49:58,350 --> 00:50:01,725
Now I have all my money.
I want to pay Fongtron back,

375
00:50:01,933 --> 00:50:04,142
and I want to cook for him.

376
00:50:04,433 --> 00:50:06,558
And he can feel happy again.

377
00:50:08,892 --> 00:50:10,642
But now he's dead.

378
00:50:22,850 --> 00:50:26,350
Cheng must be a man of honor.

379
00:50:30,725 --> 00:50:33,475
Damn, he was looking
for Pekka Forsström,

380
00:50:33,642 --> 00:50:35,142
and we didn't realize it.

381
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:39,308
I guess Cheng doesn't know
what he's going to do now.

382
00:50:39,850 --> 00:50:40,933
I guess not.

383
00:50:41,683 --> 00:50:45,767
He sure knows how to make soup.
- He sure does.

384
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:49,142
Romppainen looks
like he's come back from the dead.

385
00:50:50,517 --> 00:50:53,558
Romppainen?
- Yeah.

386
00:50:58,017 --> 00:51:00,808
What?
- And he's not the only one.

387
00:51:58,017 --> 00:52:00,100
Dad, let's go inside!

388
00:52:07,892 --> 00:52:10,058
Dad, let's go inside!

389
00:53:09,142 --> 00:53:11,975
<i>It's great news
you're coming back home.</i>

390
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:18,933
Dad is already packing the suitcases,
and we'll leave soon.

391
00:53:19,058 --> 00:53:21,517
<i>I can't wait to see you.</i>

392
00:53:21,767 --> 00:53:25,642
Somebody's coming,
I'll call you later.

393
00:53:25,808 --> 00:53:27,600
Yes?
- Cheng.

394
00:53:30,225 --> 00:53:32,308
You can't leave.
- Why?

395
00:53:32,433 --> 00:53:34,392
We need your Chinese kitchen.

396
00:53:34,558 --> 00:53:38,142
What?
- You can stay here and work here.

397
00:53:38,517 --> 00:53:41,433
People like your food.
Romppainen likes really much,

398
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:42,683
and he's sick.

399
00:53:42,808 --> 00:53:44,600
Yes, I know.
I can see it.

400
00:53:44,767 --> 00:53:46,933
And I learn, yes.

401
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:50,850
You must teach me
how to make your Chinese soup.

402
00:53:51,017 --> 00:53:54,558
No work paper.
- Your boy will like it here.

403
00:53:56,142 --> 00:53:57,767
He doesn't like it.

404
00:53:57,892 --> 00:54:00,308
That's because
he doesn't have any friends yet.

405
00:54:00,433 --> 00:54:02,142
Only a stubborn man.

406
00:54:09,225 --> 00:54:10,558
Goodbye.

407
00:54:11,892 --> 00:54:13,683
Thank you. I'm sorry.

408
00:54:28,725 --> 00:54:30,433
Crazy?

409
00:54:32,517 --> 00:54:33,808
Maybe.

410
00:54:53,267 --> 00:54:54,517
Sirkka.

411
00:54:57,350 --> 00:54:58,600
Yeah?

412
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:05,392
We decided to stay a little longer.

413
00:56:17,517 --> 00:56:22,475
CHAINASE WEEK
1. FRIED PLANTS 2. HERB RAIN DEAR

414
00:56:27,142 --> 00:56:30,392
So this is what you have today?

415
00:56:30,725 --> 00:56:34,392
Dim sum, herb reindeer
and fried vegetables.

416
00:56:34,517 --> 00:56:38,058
Are there vegetables in the reindeer?
- Some.

417
00:56:38,183 --> 00:56:41,725
Mashed potatoes and sausages then.
- We only have this.

418
00:56:41,850 --> 00:56:42,767
Jello!

419
00:56:46,683 --> 00:56:48,017
Do you have soup?

420
00:56:48,767 --> 00:56:52,808
Cheng said the reindeer has
the same effect as the soup.

421
00:56:52,933 --> 00:56:56,683
I'll have the herb rain, dear.
- There's pizza at the gas station.

422
00:56:56,850 --> 00:56:58,683
That's a 16-kilometer drive.

423
00:56:58,808 --> 00:57:01,892
I'll live dangerously
and risk it to eat foreign food.

424
00:57:02,017 --> 00:57:05,892
If I die, I'm leaving my reindeers to you.
- You don't have reindeers.

425
00:57:06,017 --> 00:57:08,017
I do have rain, dear.

426
00:57:08,433 --> 00:57:12,392
I'll also have the herb rain, dear.
Goddammit.

427
00:57:21,558 --> 00:57:25,350
This is the best "rain dear" ever.

428
00:57:33,558 --> 00:57:36,225
This is pretty much
what rabbits eat.

429
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:40,767
C'mon, grown man.

430
00:58:01,142 --> 00:58:03,433
All right.
We're here as I promised.

431
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:06,225
Cheng. It's the local school.

432
00:58:13,142 --> 00:58:16,558
We heard that you serve Asian food.
- Yes.

433
00:58:16,725 --> 00:58:20,558
But my pupils are not familiar
with Asian food.

434
00:58:20,683 --> 00:58:24,725
Okay. Noodle soup very quick.

435
00:58:25,058 --> 00:58:26,683
Is it okay?
- Yes.

436
00:58:26,850 --> 00:58:28,100
Of course.

437
00:58:28,683 --> 00:58:30,850
Excuse me, I have a question.
- Yes.

438
00:58:30,975 --> 00:58:34,142
Some of my students have
special diets, you see.

439
00:58:34,558 --> 00:58:38,433
Some are allergic to milk.
Some to gluten.

440
00:58:38,725 --> 00:58:40,850
Some come from vegetarian families.

441
00:58:40,975 --> 00:58:42,892
Okay. Understand.

442
00:58:44,225 --> 00:58:46,808
Rice noodles, no gluten.

443
00:58:47,308 --> 00:58:49,225
Chinese cooking, no milk.

444
00:58:49,433 --> 00:58:51,517
And there are
many, many vegetables.

445
00:58:51,642 --> 00:58:54,350
I think they will like it.
- Oh. Thank you.

446
00:58:54,808 --> 00:58:57,892
Come.
- Children, follow me.

447
00:59:00,642 --> 00:59:02,350
Don't touch anything.

448
00:59:03,725 --> 00:59:06,600
Behave. No horseplay.

449
00:59:07,267 --> 00:59:09,142
Tommi, don't touch anything!

450
00:59:15,308 --> 00:59:17,433
Sirkka.
- Yes?

451
00:59:17,558 --> 00:59:20,058
Can you help me cut
the Chinese cabbage?

452
00:59:20,808 --> 00:59:25,308
Make it fine. It can help cook faster.
- Okay.

453
00:59:30,808 --> 00:59:32,100
Okay.

454
00:59:33,933 --> 00:59:38,392
Chinese cooking is based on
very old tradition.

455
00:59:39,267 --> 00:59:40,808
Balance everywhere.

456
00:59:41,267 --> 00:59:44,225
In color, taste, when serving.

457
00:59:44,433 --> 00:59:46,433
And in the effect.

458
00:59:46,642 --> 00:59:48,392
Effect?
- Yes.

459
00:59:48,517 --> 00:59:53,225
For example, in winter,
we make more warming food.

460
00:59:53,392 --> 00:59:56,600
And in the summer,
we make more cooling food.

461
00:59:56,975 --> 01:00:00,808
For the active person,
we make more calming food.

462
01:00:01,017 --> 01:00:04,725
And for the lazy person,
we make more active food.

463
01:00:04,975 --> 01:00:08,100
And even for man and woman,
we can make different food -

464
01:00:08,225 --> 01:00:12,058
for different effect. Just depends
what effect you want.

465
01:00:12,183 --> 01:00:15,475
I know. It's like yin and yang.

466
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:19,975
Like love and sorrow.
Like sweet and sour.

467
01:00:20,225 --> 01:00:23,558
Exactly. Now you know everything
about Chinese cooking.

468
01:00:27,267 --> 01:00:31,100
How do you like it?
- It's delicious.

469
01:00:33,017 --> 01:00:34,350
Good.

470
01:00:38,808 --> 01:00:42,350
Well, what do you think?
- This is really good.

471
01:00:42,517 --> 01:00:45,725
You still have the Asian chef?
Is he working here?

472
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:49,600
Er... I didn't actually hire him.

473
01:00:51,058 --> 01:00:52,558
He's a trainee.

474
01:00:52,933 --> 01:00:54,600
So he's not getting paid.

475
01:00:54,767 --> 01:00:57,058
Judging by the taste,
he's no trainee.

476
01:00:57,767 --> 01:01:00,267
He has potential.

477
01:01:00,350 --> 01:01:03,808
His name is Fongtron?
- No. It was a misunderstanding.

478
01:01:04,308 --> 01:01:06,683
A misunderstanding?
- Yeah.

479
01:01:08,558 --> 01:01:12,100
I smell something.
- Yeah, smells delicious.

480
01:01:18,558 --> 01:01:20,100
You wanna go with them?

481
01:01:23,058 --> 01:01:25,183
I can give you a bike.
- No.

482
01:01:26,183 --> 01:01:28,642
You're sure?
- Yeah.

483
01:01:31,183 --> 01:01:32,558
Why?

484
01:01:33,308 --> 01:01:34,892
Dad won't let me.

485
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:39,017
Why?
- I don't know. Ask him.

486
01:01:54,183 --> 01:01:55,808
Cheng.
- Yes?

487
01:01:56,433 --> 01:01:58,725
Why don't you let Niu Niu
ride a bicycle?

488
01:01:58,892 --> 01:02:00,517
What?
- You heard me.

489
01:02:01,475 --> 01:02:03,725
None of your business.
- None of my business?

490
01:02:03,850 --> 01:02:04,975
No.

491
01:02:06,350 --> 01:02:08,808
Okay. No need to get offended.

492
01:02:12,392 --> 01:02:13,558
You okay?

493
01:02:14,475 --> 01:02:17,683
Yes...
Every month.

494
01:02:17,850 --> 01:02:18,975
Every month.

495
01:02:20,017 --> 01:02:22,558
You have child?
- No.

496
01:02:23,558 --> 01:02:27,433
Many blood come out?
- Yes.

497
01:02:28,017 --> 01:02:31,225
Better not.
Cold thing not good for you.

498
01:02:31,475 --> 01:02:33,850
Warm thing better. I make.

499
01:03:27,683 --> 01:03:32,433
Eat slow. Chewing makes
your stomach like it.

500
01:03:44,017 --> 01:03:45,642
Food good medicine.

501
01:03:46,683 --> 01:03:50,350
This sugar, cold thing
make pain for you.

502
01:04:16,475 --> 01:04:18,975
CHINESE WEEK

503
01:04:30,350 --> 01:04:31,975
Hello!

504
01:04:32,142 --> 01:04:36,142
Finally! I didn't think
I'd be getting any customers today.

505
01:04:36,308 --> 01:04:38,017
You're getting customers.

506
01:04:38,475 --> 01:04:41,183
They're from
the assisted living facility.

507
01:04:41,350 --> 01:04:42,892
I told them to come in.

508
01:04:43,725 --> 01:04:46,308
They serve rubbery potatoes
at the facility.

509
01:04:46,808 --> 01:04:51,558
What would you like?
- I hear the "rain dear" is good.

510
01:04:51,767 --> 01:04:53,392
Herb reindeer for everybody?

511
01:04:55,183 --> 01:04:56,975
Come on in. Welcome.

512
01:04:58,683 --> 01:05:00,892
Sirkka, wait.

513
01:05:03,933 --> 01:05:07,475
I know this sounds crazy,

514
01:05:08,017 --> 01:05:11,975
but I think his food is healing.

515
01:05:13,350 --> 01:05:15,433
I don't think it sounds crazy.

516
01:05:17,683 --> 01:05:21,225
I'll only eat Chinese from now on.
That's for sure.

517
01:05:21,392 --> 01:05:23,308
Me too.

518
01:05:32,808 --> 01:05:33,975
Thanks.

519
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:38,433
It looks good. Thank you.

520
01:05:39,517 --> 01:05:41,267
This is bah-kut-teh.

521
01:05:41,558 --> 01:05:43,183
Bah-kut-teh?
- Bah-kut-teh.

522
01:05:43,308 --> 01:05:44,933
Reindeer ribs tea.

523
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:47,392
Reindeer.
- Leindeel.

524
01:05:47,517 --> 01:05:49,433
Reindeer.
- Leindeel ribs soup.

525
01:05:49,517 --> 01:05:53,350
We steam the leindeel and herbs.
- Herbs?

526
01:05:53,475 --> 01:05:55,392
This is the best tea I've ever had.

527
01:05:55,767 --> 01:05:57,725
Chew well.
Your stomach feel good.

528
01:05:57,892 --> 01:06:00,600
Chew hard.
Chew well.

529
01:06:00,850 --> 01:06:02,517
Chew hald.
- Chew hard.

530
01:06:02,767 --> 01:06:04,600
Chew hard.
- Yes, chew hard.

531
01:06:06,933 --> 01:06:09,142
Chew hard.
- Hard, hard.

532
01:06:09,350 --> 01:06:11,808
Chew well, everybody!

533
01:06:12,183 --> 01:06:15,517
And tomorrow:
sweet and sour mandarin fish.

534
01:06:15,725 --> 01:06:18,892
Is it good fish?
- Like fish.

535
01:06:20,433 --> 01:06:23,183
This is one heck of a guy.

536
01:06:23,392 --> 01:06:27,017
First he makes herb "rain dear"
and then "like fish".

537
01:06:27,142 --> 01:06:28,725
Let's give a big hand to our chef.

538
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:30,850
Master Cheng!

539
01:06:34,267 --> 01:06:37,017
This is damn good.
- This is the best.

540
01:07:01,058 --> 01:07:02,350
Niu Niu!

541
01:07:03,683 --> 01:07:04,975
Niu Niu.

542
01:07:07,183 --> 01:07:08,850
Who gave you the bike?

543
01:07:10,808 --> 01:07:14,892
You mustn't take anybody's bike.

544
01:07:15,142 --> 01:07:16,558
This is mine.

545
01:07:21,475 --> 01:07:23,058
She bought you the bike?

546
01:07:33,808 --> 01:07:35,600
Why you buy him a bicycle?

547
01:07:36,725 --> 01:07:38,683
He wanted a bicycle.

548
01:07:39,642 --> 01:07:43,725
You don't let me pay anything.
- It's too much.

549
01:07:44,142 --> 01:07:46,683
No, it's nothing.
You work here all the time.

550
01:07:46,808 --> 01:07:48,642
The house is more full every day.

551
01:07:48,767 --> 01:07:51,308
Niu Niu does not want a bicycle.

552
01:07:51,725 --> 01:07:53,558
Well, yes, he does.

553
01:07:53,767 --> 01:07:55,725
His mother die with bicycle.

554
01:07:58,767 --> 01:08:00,183
Cheng, I...

555
01:08:02,308 --> 01:08:03,600
I'm sorry.

556
01:08:05,933 --> 01:08:07,183
Wait.

557
01:08:12,725 --> 01:08:14,475
You don't want a bicycle.

558
01:08:16,225 --> 01:08:19,017
He wants a bicycle.

559
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:18,100
Oh my God.
- What happened?

560
01:09:18,225 --> 01:09:19,850
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

561
01:09:19,975 --> 01:09:23,017
Are you okay?
- I'm so sorry.

562
01:09:24,932 --> 01:09:26,932
Does it hurt?
- A little bit.

563
01:09:34,557 --> 01:09:35,850
Okay.

564
01:09:44,767 --> 01:09:45,807
Painful?

565
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:48,725
That's it. We're done.

566
01:09:48,892 --> 01:09:50,475
Okay. No worries.

567
01:09:54,432 --> 01:09:55,932
Okay, now...

568
01:09:57,892 --> 01:10:01,475
Okay. Just press it.

569
01:10:02,850 --> 01:10:06,100
I think he needs a little rest now.

570
01:10:06,225 --> 01:10:08,142
Lay down and rest.

571
01:10:11,433 --> 01:10:14,725
If he doesn't vomit for a while,
he's okay.

572
01:10:14,975 --> 01:10:18,267
Okay. You're a good doctor.

573
01:10:18,433 --> 01:10:20,350
No, I'm not. I just pretend.

574
01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:23,975
You want some tea?
- Yes, please.

575
01:10:27,808 --> 01:10:28,975
Still hurts?

576
01:10:35,392 --> 01:10:36,600
Oh, no, no, no.

577
01:10:36,767 --> 01:10:38,975
What?
- No boiling water.

578
01:10:39,225 --> 01:10:40,725
Eighty degrees is good.

579
01:10:41,017 --> 01:10:43,225
Do you want me to do it again?

580
01:10:45,517 --> 01:10:48,225
You Chinese people.
You're crazy.

581
01:10:51,183 --> 01:10:52,433
Drink it.

582
01:10:59,142 --> 01:11:00,808
I think he's okay.

583
01:11:07,517 --> 01:11:09,100
Do you use it?

584
01:11:09,933 --> 01:11:11,725
I'm trying to learn.

585
01:11:21,183 --> 01:11:23,183
May I ask...

586
01:11:24,808 --> 01:11:26,142
...personal?

587
01:11:27,517 --> 01:11:28,683
Yeah.

588
01:11:30,392 --> 01:11:31,850
Do you have a man?

589
01:11:37,392 --> 01:11:38,683
I had.

590
01:11:40,142 --> 01:11:41,183
In south.

591
01:11:43,433 --> 01:11:44,725
A marriage.

592
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:52,808
We tried to have a child, but...

593
01:11:54,058 --> 01:11:56,058
...it didn't happen.

594
01:11:57,392 --> 01:11:59,517
I couldn't get pregnant.

595
01:12:01,225 --> 01:12:02,850
Eight long years.

596
01:12:08,267 --> 01:12:12,850
Maybe I didn't eat enough Chinese.
- Yes.

597
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:18,017
Then what happened?

598
01:12:18,183 --> 01:12:21,475
You still married?
- No.

599
01:12:24,350 --> 01:12:26,975
He found another woman.

600
01:12:27,725 --> 01:12:30,350
And left and...

601
01:12:31,892 --> 01:12:33,433
...had a child.

602
01:12:37,767 --> 01:12:39,100
It was a...

603
01:12:46,642 --> 01:12:51,058
I was very depressed,
and then my aunt died.

604
01:12:52,350 --> 01:12:54,225
She didn't have any children,

605
01:12:54,308 --> 01:12:57,683
so I inherited this place
and the restaurant.

606
01:12:57,850 --> 01:12:59,683
I remembered how happy I was -

607
01:12:59,850 --> 01:13:02,850
when I used to visit
this place as a child.

608
01:13:04,517 --> 01:13:07,683
Even though I knew
it wouldn't be a great business,

609
01:13:07,850 --> 01:13:11,267
I thought, "What the hell?"

610
01:13:12,933 --> 01:13:18,642
Why not give it a try, maybe.
Maybe I will be happy here.

611
01:13:23,892 --> 01:13:26,600
So here I am.

612
01:13:30,017 --> 01:13:31,642
Couldn't do no better.

613
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:38,392
Just don't look down to yourself.

614
01:13:38,767 --> 01:13:40,642
It does not do any good.

615
01:13:41,517 --> 01:13:42,892
That's true.

616
01:13:46,767 --> 01:13:48,225
In China...

617
01:13:50,850 --> 01:13:54,017
...women not usually live alone.

618
01:13:54,642 --> 01:13:57,683
In Finland we do.
And there's a reason.

619
01:13:57,808 --> 01:13:58,892
What is it?

620
01:13:59,225 --> 01:14:00,767
Men are so stupid.

621
01:14:04,225 --> 01:14:07,558
It was a joke. You can laugh.

622
01:14:10,517 --> 01:14:13,517
And how can I find a man
here anyway?

623
01:14:13,808 --> 01:14:18,475
Everybody's over sixty
or married or drunk or both.

624
01:14:21,433 --> 01:14:23,183
Is it a joke?

625
01:14:23,850 --> 01:14:25,642
No, that's the truth.

626
01:14:34,267 --> 01:14:35,808
Sirkka!

627
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:41,267
Sirkka!
- Yeah? Good morning.

628
01:14:43,517 --> 01:14:45,308
Do you have...

629
01:14:47,808 --> 01:14:49,433
I'm having stomach pain.

630
01:14:51,433 --> 01:14:55,142
Who told you?
- Romppainen told me.

631
01:14:56,350 --> 01:14:59,392
He gossips so much. A grown man.

632
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:02,725
Do you have the soup for me?
- Here it is.

633
01:15:15,017 --> 01:15:16,350
Chew.

634
01:15:16,975 --> 01:15:18,892
Chew? This is soup.

635
01:15:19,058 --> 01:15:20,642
Believe me. Chew.

636
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:46,933
Cheng is a miracle man.

637
01:15:50,142 --> 01:15:52,725
Vilppula's blood pressure is down.

638
01:15:52,975 --> 01:15:56,183
Eki Raskavaara has
regular bowel movements,

639
01:15:56,392 --> 01:15:58,100
and believe me,
he's never had that.

640
01:15:59,308 --> 01:16:04,558
Tauno Teriö said his kidney stones
dissolved and came out with pee.

641
01:16:04,683 --> 01:16:06,517
He said he saw crumbs in his pee.

642
01:16:06,933 --> 01:16:10,683
How can food have that effect?
- It can.

643
01:16:11,392 --> 01:16:13,142
Hope does wonders.

644
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:18,017
Stop.

645
01:16:22,558 --> 01:16:24,267
Something I can help you with?

646
01:16:24,808 --> 01:16:28,517
I heard you have medicine
for stomach pain.

647
01:16:46,058 --> 01:16:47,267
Thanks.

648
01:16:50,308 --> 01:16:55,142
This "like fish" is damn good.
- Yeah, it's damn good.

649
01:16:55,267 --> 01:16:58,017
Good?
- Excellent. - Very good.

650
01:16:59,475 --> 01:17:00,683
Listen.

651
01:17:02,308 --> 01:17:08,183
Now we want you to do
something very Finnish.

652
01:17:08,725 --> 01:17:10,100
Very Finnish.

653
01:17:10,517 --> 01:17:12,433
Me?
- You.

654
01:17:33,683 --> 01:17:35,142
Feels good.

655
01:17:48,850 --> 01:17:53,100
You know, these are all made
by him, Vilppula. - Oh.

656
01:17:53,267 --> 01:17:56,475
He's very famous in Helsinki.

657
01:17:56,600 --> 01:18:00,267
Well, maybe not in Helsinki,
but in Rovaniemi anyway.

658
01:18:00,558 --> 01:18:04,267
Maybe not in Rovaniemi,
but Pojopoki. - Pohopoki.

659
01:18:04,392 --> 01:18:07,433
Pojopoki. He's very famous
in Pojopoki. Yes.

660
01:18:29,767 --> 01:18:31,225
I'm not fish.

661
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:36,142
And I cannot swim also.

662
01:18:41,350 --> 01:18:42,683
Pass here.

663
01:18:50,350 --> 01:18:53,183
What?
- Go to the ball.

664
01:18:54,850 --> 01:18:56,475
I'm the goalie.
- Good.

665
01:19:03,267 --> 01:19:05,350
Good job! Good.

666
01:19:12,100 --> 01:19:13,600
Do you have a wife?

667
01:19:15,808 --> 01:19:18,558
Yes, but she's dead.

668
01:19:19,975 --> 01:19:21,017
Oh.

669
01:19:22,808 --> 01:19:24,058
Accident.

670
01:19:25,100 --> 01:19:27,392
She ride a bicycle,

671
01:19:27,683 --> 01:19:29,683
and then a big car come.

672
01:19:30,183 --> 01:19:31,933
Bang.
- Oh.

673
01:19:32,308 --> 01:19:35,975
She's dead.
- I'm sorry. So sorry.

674
01:19:37,433 --> 01:19:41,600
After she die,
I work day and night.

675
01:19:42,142 --> 01:19:45,517
And I have no time
to spend with my son.

676
01:19:47,142 --> 01:19:48,267
Then -

677
01:19:49,475 --> 01:19:52,392
I start to drink.
- Drink?

678
01:19:52,725 --> 01:19:55,767
Yes. Very, very much.

679
01:19:57,433 --> 01:20:01,600
And borrow money
from the bad people -

680
01:20:01,767 --> 01:20:03,767
to run my restaurant.

681
01:20:03,892 --> 01:20:05,892
And then Fongtron saved me.

682
01:20:07,142 --> 01:20:08,933
He give me money -

683
01:20:09,183 --> 01:20:12,642
so that I can pay back
the bad people.

684
01:20:14,267 --> 01:20:16,017
And he always said that -

685
01:20:17,267 --> 01:20:19,183
Finland is a good place.

686
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:21,392
"It's good for your boy."

687
01:20:22,433 --> 01:20:26,558
So afterwards,
I sell my restaurant,

688
01:20:26,808 --> 01:20:30,100
and then I come here
with my son.

689
01:20:31,350 --> 01:20:34,642
And I want to pay Fongtron back
so badly.

690
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:36,475
But he's dead.

691
01:20:37,058 --> 01:20:39,433
Fongtron was right.

692
01:20:39,683 --> 01:20:43,433
Finland is good place
to you and your son.

693
01:20:46,017 --> 01:20:49,725
But now we must go to sauna.

694
01:20:51,308 --> 01:20:52,392
More?

695
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:09,808
Let's get down to business!

696
01:21:14,892 --> 01:21:17,058
Karsk.
- Karsk.

697
01:21:50,225 --> 01:21:52,058
Is the singer any good?

698
01:21:52,433 --> 01:21:55,517
She can even get people
with two left feet dancing.

699
01:22:03,433 --> 01:22:06,225
Niu Niu. Put the music on.

700
01:22:09,308 --> 01:22:12,392
Okay. And then the position.

701
01:22:12,725 --> 01:22:15,142
Yeah. Okay.

702
01:22:15,933 --> 01:22:17,892
And then you start
with the left.

703
01:22:18,058 --> 01:22:19,767
Okay? You remember?

704
01:22:19,933 --> 01:22:21,767
One, two, three, four.

705
01:22:22,392 --> 01:22:25,267
Slow, slow, quick, quick.

706
01:22:25,475 --> 01:22:29,267
Slow. No. You need to hold me,
like, here, like, close.

707
01:22:30,058 --> 01:22:31,933
Argh, you stubborn man.

708
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:35,725
Okay, now.
One, two, three, four.

709
01:22:35,850 --> 01:22:39,183
Slow, slow, quick, quick.

710
01:22:39,392 --> 01:22:42,225
Are you nervous?
- It is interesting.

711
01:22:42,350 --> 01:22:45,975
No, no, no.
In Finland, we say what we think.

712
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:50,683
Don't be polite.
It just makes things complicated.

713
01:22:51,683 --> 01:22:54,142
Okay? So...

714
01:22:55,433 --> 01:22:56,808
You're nervous?

715
01:22:58,142 --> 01:23:00,975
Yes or no?
- No.

716
01:23:04,767 --> 01:23:06,308
I think you are too nervous.

717
01:23:08,267 --> 01:23:09,475
And shy.

718
01:23:11,975 --> 01:23:13,058
Close it.

719
01:23:27,517 --> 01:23:28,600
Okay.

720
01:23:44,183 --> 01:23:46,725
Good?
- Yes.

721
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:48,808
Good. That's how you do it.

722
01:23:49,017 --> 01:23:50,975
You say what you think.

723
01:23:58,058 --> 01:23:59,183
Look.

724
01:24:17,558 --> 01:24:21,767
Okay, let's go.
- No, no, no! Not yet.

725
01:24:24,017 --> 01:24:28,600
Hi. Two donuts
and a mineral water for him.

726
01:24:29,058 --> 01:24:32,017
Sirkka.
- Yeah, sugar is bad for you.

727
01:24:32,433 --> 01:24:33,850
Don't say anything.

728
01:24:34,225 --> 01:24:35,558
Hi.
- Hi.

729
01:24:37,183 --> 01:24:38,308
Thanks.

730
01:24:39,350 --> 01:24:42,017
Let's go.
- Don't eat it all.

731
01:24:45,267 --> 01:24:49,100
Quick, quick, slow, slow, slow.

732
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:53,433
Quick, quick, slow, slow, slow.

733
01:24:53,725 --> 01:24:57,600
Quick, quick, slow, slow, slow.

734
01:24:57,725 --> 01:25:00,183
Quick, quick...
- And?

735
01:25:00,350 --> 01:25:02,808
What?
- Are you ready to go?

736
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:08,808
Let's go.

737
01:25:10,225 --> 01:25:11,308
C'mon.

738
01:25:21,225 --> 01:25:25,183
When the flaming sun goes down

739
01:25:25,308 --> 01:25:29,392
And the woods fall into a trance

740
01:25:29,517 --> 01:25:33,642
In the wind the treetops bow

741
01:25:33,933 --> 01:25:38,225
Making the shadows
of the night dance

742
01:25:38,350 --> 01:25:42,308
From the shadows of the earth
into space, flying free

743
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:46,683
Like a particle that blends

744
01:25:46,933 --> 01:25:51,183
I'd fade into eternity

745
01:25:51,433 --> 01:25:55,725
A particle that never ends

746
01:25:58,183 --> 01:26:01,933
I hear something calling me
at night

747
01:26:02,267 --> 01:26:06,308
A call so quiet and bittersweet

748
01:26:06,850 --> 01:26:10,725
And the sigh
of the wind whispers oh so light

749
01:26:10,975 --> 01:26:15,058
The longing is complete

750
01:26:15,308 --> 01:26:19,392
If the wind gave me wings to fly

751
01:26:19,517 --> 01:26:23,433
I'd leave
this darkening earth behind

752
01:26:23,892 --> 01:26:27,933
I'd soar into the evening sky

753
01:26:28,225 --> 01:26:32,350
Into the brightening starshine

754
01:27:37,142 --> 01:27:40,433
Eighty degrees.
- Thank you.

755
01:27:45,767 --> 01:27:48,142
Do you notice
that he's not sad anymore?

756
01:27:50,642 --> 01:27:53,267
This is really a good place to be.

757
01:27:53,975 --> 01:27:55,725
Near to paradise.

758
01:27:56,517 --> 01:27:59,433
Well, we have our problems
like everybody else.

759
01:28:00,267 --> 01:28:01,850
But you have everything.

760
01:28:02,725 --> 01:28:04,183
Everything what?

761
01:28:20,892 --> 01:28:22,392
Where are we going?

762
01:28:52,225 --> 01:28:53,558
What do you hear?

763
01:28:55,850 --> 01:28:57,892
Nothing.
- Exactly.

764
01:28:59,808 --> 01:29:03,475
I live in Shanghai.
A big city.

765
01:29:04,767 --> 01:29:08,308
You can hear
how quiet sounds here.

766
01:29:15,350 --> 01:29:18,475
Sirkka. One thing.

767
01:29:19,308 --> 01:29:20,392
Yeah?

768
01:29:22,017 --> 01:29:25,850
It is easy for you to find
a handsome guy if you want.

769
01:29:28,350 --> 01:29:30,642
Handsome men can be stupid.

770
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:33,642
Yes, I know.
- Do you?

771
01:29:36,767 --> 01:29:39,600
Do you have a phone in your pocket?
- No. Why?

772
01:29:42,975 --> 01:29:46,017
Help, help... I can't swim!

773
01:29:46,142 --> 01:29:48,392
Oh my God. Wait! Wait!

774
01:29:52,225 --> 01:29:54,433
Very clever! Very clever!

775
01:29:54,850 --> 01:29:58,642
I didn't tell you I was a swimming
champion when I was young!

776
01:30:00,725 --> 01:30:02,017
It's warm.

777
01:30:07,767 --> 01:30:08,975
Think about it.

778
01:30:09,933 --> 01:30:12,183
Four billion men in the world.

779
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:14,308
You can have many choice.

780
01:30:15,767 --> 01:30:19,308
I can choose anyone I want.
- Sure.

781
01:30:23,225 --> 01:30:24,725
I'll think about it.

782
01:31:47,308 --> 01:31:51,183
I'm hungry.
Give me herb rain, dear.

783
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:54,475
We know that his visa expired.

784
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:56,600
These days,
we can see it digitally.

785
01:31:56,725 --> 01:31:59,767
They're so strict about these things today.
- Very strict.

786
01:32:00,183 --> 01:32:02,933
We're actually being flexible here.

787
01:32:04,058 --> 01:32:06,808
Very flexible.
- I understand.

788
01:32:07,517 --> 01:32:10,350
But the food was delicious,
as always. Thanks.

789
01:32:18,683 --> 01:32:22,017
The law is the law.
There's nothing we can do.

790
01:32:24,183 --> 01:32:26,975
I should have seen this coming
a long time ago.

791
01:32:27,142 --> 01:32:29,767
It would be a big loss for you
if he had to leave.

792
01:32:29,892 --> 01:32:32,558
A big loss for all of us.

793
01:32:32,767 --> 01:32:35,767
I'm alive thanks to his food.

794
01:32:36,850 --> 01:32:39,517
Seriously?
- Oh yes, indeed.

795
01:32:41,392 --> 01:32:43,433
Maybe I'll throw in the towel
and close up.

796
01:32:45,642 --> 01:32:49,308
This place won't be profitable
without Cheng. - You can cook.

797
01:32:49,475 --> 01:32:51,058
I can't.

798
01:32:52,267 --> 01:32:55,308
I'll just end up chopping
my fingers off into the soup.

799
01:33:02,225 --> 01:33:04,100
What? What's going on?

800
01:33:04,308 --> 01:33:07,600
Nothing.
- Yes, there is.

801
01:33:10,975 --> 01:33:12,267
Papers.

802
01:33:15,058 --> 01:33:16,767
Your papers.

803
01:33:21,308 --> 01:33:22,392
I knew it.

804
01:33:24,267 --> 01:33:25,725
So I must go.

805
01:33:28,767 --> 01:33:30,392
So you're gonna go?

806
01:33:32,725 --> 01:33:34,433
I'm sorry, Sirkka.

807
01:33:35,267 --> 01:33:38,225
I thought you knew
I cannot stay forever.

808
01:33:39,433 --> 01:33:41,350
So you're just gonna go?

809
01:33:57,475 --> 01:33:58,850
I wanna pay you.

810
01:34:01,100 --> 01:34:04,017
What? - I wanna pay for your work.
It's all here.

811
01:34:05,558 --> 01:34:07,975
I told you. No need to pay.

812
01:34:09,975 --> 01:34:13,058
Why are you doing this?
- Why I cook?

813
01:34:13,850 --> 01:34:16,475
Why are you doing this?
- I'm a cook.

814
01:34:17,808 --> 01:34:19,975
You know what I'm talking about.

815
01:34:20,142 --> 01:34:24,100
Did you think you can just come
here and cook and cook and -

816
01:34:24,267 --> 01:34:25,850
walk away?

817
01:34:26,683 --> 01:34:27,933
Sirkka.

818
01:35:40,475 --> 01:35:44,183
Hi. Why don't you keep an eye
on the boy for a couple of hours?

819
01:35:44,308 --> 01:35:46,975
She'll take care of him
for a few hours.

820
01:35:47,183 --> 01:35:49,683
What?
- No questions.

821
01:35:49,767 --> 01:35:51,350
We have some guy business here.

822
01:35:51,475 --> 01:35:53,808
Get in, please. Ciao ciao!

823
01:36:20,433 --> 01:36:21,558
Hi!

824
01:36:27,225 --> 01:36:29,433
Good. Just go.

825
01:36:34,808 --> 01:36:38,558
You want to kidnap me?
- Maybe, maybe.

826
01:36:39,308 --> 01:36:42,725
Ni hao.
- Weigh the anchor!

827
01:37:28,350 --> 01:37:32,142
"He raised his glass with a grin,
'Brothers, let the drinking begin.'"

828
01:37:32,308 --> 01:37:33,767
Cheers.
- Cheers.

829
01:37:37,142 --> 01:37:41,475
There's only one answer

830
01:37:43,558 --> 01:37:45,392
Summer in Lapland

831
01:37:49,933 --> 01:37:52,183
Please, have a small.

832
01:38:05,850 --> 01:38:07,017
Cheng.

833
01:38:08,475 --> 01:38:10,600
Your food.
- Yes?

834
01:38:12,517 --> 01:38:16,767
Sometimes it can heal a person.

835
01:38:18,142 --> 01:38:23,433
I mean if you are ill,
you can do better with the food.

836
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:27,517
Yes, but not always.
- I know.

837
01:38:28,267 --> 01:38:30,683
I have this cancer.

838
01:38:31,558 --> 01:38:36,058
And I know it will follow me
till the last day of my life.

839
01:38:37,558 --> 01:38:41,725
But what your food gave to me
was hope.

840
01:38:44,392 --> 01:38:46,350
You gave hope to me.

841
01:38:46,725 --> 01:38:50,600
You gave hope to all of us.
You gave hope to Sirkka.

842
01:38:52,683 --> 01:38:55,058
And I want to thank you for that.

843
01:38:55,725 --> 01:38:56,933
Yeah.

844
01:38:57,558 --> 01:39:02,267
Sometimes hope and health
are the same thing.

845
01:39:02,558 --> 01:39:05,058
Exact... Exactly.

846
01:39:09,350 --> 01:39:12,225
Now Sirkka is very sad.

847
01:39:13,058 --> 01:39:15,433
She has no hope.

848
01:39:16,433 --> 01:39:23,350
Oh, learn from the swans

849
01:39:25,100 --> 01:39:32,475
They leave in the fall
and come back in spring

850
01:39:32,892 --> 01:39:39,517
Our shores are
so peaceful and calm

851
01:39:40,725 --> 01:39:48,725
And safe are the Lapland hills,
so nurturing

852
01:39:52,558 --> 01:39:56,808
Rustling your wings

853
01:39:57,267 --> 01:40:02,808
Soar through the air

854
01:40:04,392 --> 01:40:06,267
Do important things

855
01:40:07,475 --> 01:40:10,975
Bring the joy for which we yearn

856
01:40:11,183 --> 01:40:18,308
When you see
winter has gone from here

857
01:40:21,350 --> 01:40:22,850
I beg you

858
01:40:24,892 --> 01:40:26,767
I ask you

859
01:40:29,558 --> 01:40:32,683
Please return

860
01:40:40,892 --> 01:40:42,892
So there's Vega.

861
01:40:44,808 --> 01:40:46,392
In the south.

862
01:40:48,017 --> 01:40:50,100
And then there's Milky Way.

863
01:40:51,933 --> 01:40:55,642
And then there's Big Bear.

864
01:41:01,892 --> 01:41:04,392
And Arcturus.

865
01:41:06,350 --> 01:41:08,392
The brightest of all.

866
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:13,267
And Capella.

867
01:41:31,933 --> 01:41:37,975
Her pink cheeks

868
01:41:39,975 --> 01:41:43,725
Look just like the red sun

869
01:41:45,267 --> 01:41:50,142
Her beautiful eyes

870
01:41:50,475 --> 01:41:57,517
Just like the pure moon at night

871
01:42:01,225 --> 01:42:08,183
I would leave everything I own

872
01:42:09,017 --> 01:42:12,725
And follow her, my shepherd

873
01:42:14,517 --> 01:42:25,933
To see her lovely smile
and pretty dress

874
01:42:30,142 --> 01:42:35,850
I would love to be a lamb

875
01:42:38,517 --> 01:42:41,850
And follow her

876
01:42:43,933 --> 01:42:48,892
I wish she could hold a little lash

877
01:42:49,100 --> 01:42:55,517
And whip me lightly

878
01:43:30,058 --> 01:43:32,850
Morning.
- Good morning. Mama's birthday.

879
01:43:36,683 --> 01:43:37,808
Niu Niu!

880
01:43:54,808 --> 01:43:57,933
I'm sorry, Dad. I slept in.

881
01:43:58,100 --> 01:44:00,433
No rush. Come here, Niu Niu.

882
01:44:02,017 --> 01:44:03,267
I'm watching the clouds.

883
01:44:03,433 --> 01:44:05,475
Look. Beautiful, isn't it?

884
01:44:08,725 --> 01:44:10,808
When I was a little boy,
I dreamed -

885
01:44:12,225 --> 01:44:15,725
there's another world
beyond those clouds.

886
01:44:16,767 --> 01:44:18,975
Is Mom there?

887
01:44:20,433 --> 01:44:21,558
Maybe.

888
01:45:12,392 --> 01:45:14,975
Can Mom see us?

889
01:45:17,850 --> 01:45:19,183
I think so.

890
01:45:21,433 --> 01:45:28,350
Niu Niu, let's make some noise
so that she can hear us.

891
01:45:29,933 --> 01:45:34,683
IN MEMORY
OF MY LOVING MOTHER

892
01:46:06,433 --> 01:46:08,058
Look. It's Mom.

893
01:46:43,933 --> 01:46:45,433
I can eat with sticks.

894
01:46:47,350 --> 01:46:49,183
This is delicious.

895
01:46:50,975 --> 01:46:54,308
This is better.
- Better than the rubbery potatoes.

896
01:47:01,058 --> 01:47:03,433
You're having soup.

897
01:47:06,392 --> 01:47:08,642
This is a fat man's soup.

898
01:47:14,058 --> 01:47:16,933
Where is he?
- Fongtron?

899
01:47:17,350 --> 01:47:18,892
No, the Chinese guy.

900
01:47:21,017 --> 01:47:22,933
Never heard of him.

901
01:47:23,475 --> 01:47:30,392
Outward.
You can flex your muscles a bit.

902
01:47:31,350 --> 01:47:33,017
Bring your arms down.

903
01:47:36,017 --> 01:47:39,433
He's so tai chi'd,
he can't stand up.

904
01:47:42,475 --> 01:47:45,725
One more time. Here we go.

905
01:47:51,642 --> 01:47:54,225
Turn your palms out.

906
01:47:54,933 --> 01:47:59,683
Bring your arms down.
Good job. That's it.

907
01:48:57,392 --> 01:48:59,600
<i>Hi. We are in China now.</i>

908
01:48:59,892 --> 01:49:03,142
<i>My dad and Sirkka
decided to get married.</i>

909
01:49:03,267 --> 01:49:04,517
<i>We hope to see you soon.</i>

910
01:49:04,725 --> 01:49:06,475
Oh, dang!

911
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:10,433
Oh, Sirkka looks so pretty.

912
01:49:12,058 --> 01:49:14,600
Will you marry me?
- Of course.

913
01:49:17,600 --> 01:49:20,100
Happy wedding day to you

914
01:49:20,600 --> 01:49:22,892
Happy wedding day to you

915
01:49:23,142 --> 01:49:26,225
Happy wedding day,
dear Sirkka and Cheng

916
01:49:26,850 --> 01:49:30,017
Happy wedding day to you

917
01:49:37,433 --> 01:49:43,433
Hey! Hey!
Sirkka! Good wedding! Wedding!

918
01:49:44,183 --> 01:49:46,850
Hi!
- <i>We'll be back.</i>

919
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:50,433
<i>"We will be back," I said.
We will be back.</i>

920
01:49:50,558 --> 01:49:53,850
<i>Willow bee...
- ...back. We'll be back.</i>

921
01:49:54,058 --> 01:49:57,017
<i>Willow bee... hack.
- We'll be back.</i>

922
01:49:57,225 --> 01:49:59,683
<i>We'll bee...</i>
