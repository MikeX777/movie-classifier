1
00:04:53,647 --> 00:04:55,717
- Where should I put it?
- In the bedroom.

2
00:05:10,807 --> 00:05:14,243
Will that be all?
I will return to the boss.

3
00:05:21,887 --> 00:05:23,002
Ténin!

4
00:05:27,967 --> 00:05:29,082
Come here!

5
00:05:36,447 --> 00:05:38,597
Go buy your father's medicine!

6
00:05:41,567 --> 00:05:42,795
Be quick about it!

7
00:05:57,327 --> 00:06:00,842
Fanta? Have you arrived?

8
00:06:06,087 --> 00:06:08,647
And the family in Dakar?

9
00:06:10,447 --> 00:06:13,086
Oh, no.
Ténin has been well-behaved.

10
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:16,683
She hasn't given me any worries.

11
00:06:19,567 --> 00:06:21,319
Hurry back.

12
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:23,717
I need to see you again.

13
00:06:24,527 --> 00:06:27,564
No, I couldn't get all the medicine.

14
00:06:29,727 --> 00:06:33,003
You have the best wishes of everyone.

15
00:08:04,407 --> 00:08:06,125
You're leaving us, Sekou?

16
00:08:07,607 --> 00:08:08,722
Yes.

17
00:08:09,527 --> 00:08:14,806
We've worked together
for a long time.

18
00:08:16,607 --> 00:08:18,757
If working made me happy...

19
00:08:18,967 --> 00:08:21,640
I would do it.

20
00:08:25,727 --> 00:08:27,843
In fact, it oppresses me.

21
00:08:30,087 --> 00:08:31,406
What are you trying to say?

22
00:08:35,247 --> 00:08:37,044
In five years, I have...

23
00:08:37,847 --> 00:08:41,476
never moved up.

24
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:50,879
I only make 10,000 FM.

25
00:08:57,007 --> 00:09:01,159
Can anyone support
a family with that?

26
00:09:05,927 --> 00:09:08,395
Where do you want to go?

27
00:09:24,287 --> 00:09:25,845
I want to leave the factory...

28
00:09:27,007 --> 00:09:29,043
and try elsewhere.

29
00:09:30,447 --> 00:09:32,677
Sekou, you do not
deserve to succeed.

30
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:37,079
You think yourself so clever...

31
00:09:37,807 --> 00:09:42,517
for trying your luck elsewhere.

32
00:09:43,567 --> 00:09:47,321
But you learned everything
you know at my house.

33
00:09:48,007 --> 00:09:49,156
That's true.

34
00:10:05,567 --> 00:10:09,526
And you know that
I'm not afraid of work!

35
00:10:11,407 --> 00:10:14,843
Give me a raise, and I'll stay.

36
00:10:20,167 --> 00:10:23,921
If not, I'll resign.

37
00:10:28,167 --> 00:10:30,681
You prefer the easy way out.

38
00:10:31,567 --> 00:10:34,445
You're pursuing his shadow.

39
00:10:35,727 --> 00:10:39,879
Be patient,
and you'll get a raise.

40
00:10:44,687 --> 00:10:46,564
If you leave...

41
00:10:46,767 --> 00:10:48,997
you won't see another penny!

42
00:10:49,167 --> 00:10:50,805
I understand that.

43
00:10:51,527 --> 00:10:54,917
You are rich, and I'm not.

44
00:10:58,007 --> 00:11:00,362
"Although God gives
us misfortunes today...

45
00:11:02,247 --> 00:11:05,045
"we are still responsible
for tomorrow"...

46
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:10,358
I'm leaving, but before I go...

47
00:11:11,807 --> 00:11:14,002
know that I have understood well.

48
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:18,478
The rich are ungrateful.

49
00:11:20,967 --> 00:11:23,242
Shut your mouth, fool!

50
00:11:23,567 --> 00:11:26,684
I'll get another son of a bitch...

51
00:11:26,927 --> 00:11:29,043
who knows his place.

52
00:11:29,207 --> 00:11:31,198
And I'll get a new boss.

53
00:12:11,447 --> 00:12:13,324
Hello, Adams.

54
00:12:13,487 --> 00:12:16,285
You, Sitan, what's up?
We're mad.

55
00:12:18,767 --> 00:12:21,839
You're playing deaf.

56
00:12:22,047 --> 00:12:25,483
I didn't hear.

57
00:12:29,127 --> 00:12:30,446
Other than that, how's it going?

58
00:12:30,647 --> 00:12:32,285
Where are you going?

59
00:12:32,447 --> 00:12:33,926
Shopping.

60
00:12:38,487 --> 00:12:40,842
Who's this?

61
00:12:41,007 --> 00:12:42,486
My little sister.

62
00:12:42,647 --> 00:12:44,922
What's her name?

63
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:49,398
Hi, Ténin.

64
00:12:52,087 --> 00:12:56,205
Did you fall out
of heaven just for me?

65
00:12:56,367 --> 00:12:58,164
Definitely not.

66
00:12:58,967 --> 00:13:00,116
Jealous?

67
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,561
No.

68
00:13:07,767 --> 00:13:10,327
Well, then, I'm on my way.

69
00:13:12,047 --> 00:13:14,766
Goodbye.

70
00:14:14,807 --> 00:14:18,277
Sekou, what are you telling me?

71
00:14:19,927 --> 00:14:21,883
I quit the factory.

72
00:14:25,327 --> 00:14:26,806
Why?

73
00:14:28,247 --> 00:14:33,241
I could never get ahead there,
so I'm going to look for something else.

74
00:14:38,407 --> 00:14:41,604
We depend on you.

75
00:14:42,607 --> 00:14:44,563
Have you forgotten that?

76
00:14:45,647 --> 00:14:47,239
No, father.

77
00:14:52,727 --> 00:14:54,604
This is rather alarming.

78
00:14:55,087 --> 00:14:59,080
You quit a job that supports us.

79
00:15:35,607 --> 00:15:37,598
Why are you looking at her like that?

80
00:15:43,447 --> 00:15:45,324
Is she mute?

81
00:15:45,767 --> 00:15:47,644
A case of meningitis,
when she was 6.

82
00:15:47,807 --> 00:15:51,163
And this trip, it's still on?

83
00:15:52,607 --> 00:15:53,801
Yes.

84
00:15:58,647 --> 00:16:01,400
I'm saving.

85
00:16:01,567 --> 00:16:02,716
Already?

86
00:16:28,007 --> 00:16:28,962
You've been gone a long time.

87
00:16:29,167 --> 00:16:31,806
We've been shopping.

88
00:16:32,527 --> 00:16:34,757
After girls, no doubt.

89
00:16:36,407 --> 00:16:37,806
Go on, let it out.

90
00:16:37,967 --> 00:16:42,279
You don't think it's true?

91
00:16:42,487 --> 00:16:44,762
You're lying!

92
00:16:44,927 --> 00:16:46,645
Come on Adams, we're leaving.

93
00:16:47,687 --> 00:16:50,326
Ténin, go with Sekou.

94
00:16:50,487 --> 00:16:52,443
Meet at the movie theater.

95
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:51,077
Turn down the music!

96
00:18:51,647 --> 00:18:54,559
We're not deaf!

97
00:18:55,127 --> 00:18:56,242
Where is Ténin?

98
00:18:56,407 --> 00:18:57,681
At the movies.

99
00:18:58,527 --> 00:18:59,801
Give me a drink.

100
00:19:41,127 --> 00:19:43,243
Where are you going with Ténin?

101
00:19:45,287 --> 00:19:48,836
To visit my parents.

102
00:19:50,527 --> 00:19:51,960
Say hello to them for me.

103
00:19:54,287 --> 00:19:55,800
Don't stay too long.

104
00:20:01,047 --> 00:20:03,117
You're here? It's late.

105
00:20:03,567 --> 00:20:04,841
I'm hungry.

106
00:20:05,007 --> 00:20:06,645
Go try the kitchen.

107
00:20:08,647 --> 00:20:09,363
Hello.

108
00:20:09,567 --> 00:20:13,765
Is that you, Diaby?
It's been a long time...

109
00:20:18,527 --> 00:20:20,563
And here you are as well, my pretty.

110
00:20:21,647 --> 00:20:23,399
Hello, Salimata.

111
00:20:24,407 --> 00:20:25,999
Hello, Mah.

112
00:20:26,167 --> 00:20:28,078
How are you?

113
00:20:28,767 --> 00:20:30,041
Very well.

114
00:20:54,567 --> 00:20:57,286
I'll leave you,
I have some business at the house.

115
00:20:59,567 --> 00:21:01,478
We can't talk anymore.

116
00:21:02,647 --> 00:21:06,481
There will be another time.
Goodbye.

117
00:21:19,047 --> 00:21:20,526
Where have you been?

118
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:23,475
The driver...

119
00:21:23,647 --> 00:21:25,319
he was late.

120
00:21:25,527 --> 00:21:27,483
Let's go sit down.

121
00:21:53,167 --> 00:21:54,520
Where is Malick?

122
00:21:55,727 --> 00:21:57,001
Somewhere else.

123
00:21:57,327 --> 00:21:58,521
Where's that?

124
00:22:01,927 --> 00:22:03,565
Not here, get it?

125
00:22:04,967 --> 00:22:06,002
No.

126
00:22:08,887 --> 00:22:10,161
He'll be here shortly.

127
00:22:18,767 --> 00:22:20,166
Want to dance?

128
00:22:43,287 --> 00:22:44,686
Let me take over.

129
00:22:44,847 --> 00:22:46,519
If you want.

130
00:23:17,727 --> 00:23:19,160
Sambou, come here.

131
00:23:19,327 --> 00:23:20,726
Where are you taking me?

132
00:23:20,887 --> 00:23:22,115
You'll see.

133
00:23:33,727 --> 00:23:35,558
If I make you happy, say so.

134
00:23:37,327 --> 00:23:38,601
Don't hide anything.

135
00:23:41,487 --> 00:23:43,045
Look at me.

136
00:24:08,127 --> 00:24:10,118
You're not bored?

137
00:24:11,167 --> 00:24:14,443
You know that I'm attracted to you?

138
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:23,646
What time is it?

139
00:24:24,687 --> 00:24:26,564
Four o'clock.

140
00:24:27,407 --> 00:24:28,920
It's late, we should go.

141
00:24:31,527 --> 00:24:35,315
Stay longer.

142
00:24:35,487 --> 00:24:37,796
We have to leave,
because of our parents.

143
00:24:46,287 --> 00:24:47,686
I'll go with you.

144
00:27:19,647 --> 00:27:20,921
Where is Adams?

145
00:27:21,487 --> 00:27:22,806
I have no idea.

146
00:27:26,727 --> 00:27:28,126
Ténin, where is Adams?

147
00:27:35,327 --> 00:27:37,397
You must know.

148
00:27:37,567 --> 00:27:39,080
She didn't say anything to me.

149
00:27:39,887 --> 00:27:41,957
- Were you arguing?
- No.

150
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:45,483
I told you to
leave the children alone.

151
00:27:47,967 --> 00:27:49,798
I didn't do anything to your niece.

152
00:27:50,687 --> 00:27:54,965
She's out on the town.
Ténin, would you leave her?

153
00:27:55,127 --> 00:27:57,083
She can go to hell!
I scoff at her!

154
00:28:01,007 --> 00:28:04,044
You could say that again
if you were spotless.

155
00:28:58,567 --> 00:29:02,321
You're already full?
You have to eat.

156
00:29:20,647 --> 00:29:21,796
Pass me the water.

157
00:31:52,007 --> 00:31:53,679
I got delayed.

158
00:31:54,007 --> 00:31:57,079
I had to wait for her father to leave.

159
00:31:58,967 --> 00:32:00,559
We are already swimming.

160
00:32:00,727 --> 00:32:03,002
That doesn't matter.

161
00:35:42,047 --> 00:35:45,722
Thief! Thief!

162
00:38:38,767 --> 00:38:40,439
Sekou has consulted me...

163
00:38:41,687 --> 00:38:43,723
about his financial worries.

164
00:38:44,567 --> 00:38:49,561
I can already see the solution.

165
00:38:51,327 --> 00:38:52,885
He has consulted me as well.

166
00:38:54,287 --> 00:38:58,326
He must pass by here.
We'll catch him on his way.

167
00:39:01,327 --> 00:39:03,887
What did the spirits say?

168
00:39:19,967 --> 00:39:21,241
Hey, you, stop!

169
00:39:50,487 --> 00:39:51,840
Here's your share.

170
00:39:54,367 --> 00:39:56,358
Are you satisfied?

171
00:39:56,527 --> 00:39:57,516
Yes.

172
00:40:06,447 --> 00:40:08,119
He seems rich.

173
00:40:08,847 --> 00:40:10,280
Yes, I would say.

174
00:41:57,927 --> 00:41:59,121
Leave me alone.

175
00:41:59,287 --> 00:42:01,801
I can't.

176
00:42:06,687 --> 00:42:07,676
I love you.

177
00:42:07,847 --> 00:42:09,360
I don't.

178
00:43:29,687 --> 00:43:33,157
What's wrong with you?
Are you sick?

179
00:43:35,567 --> 00:43:38,286
Do you have a fever?

180
00:43:39,807 --> 00:43:42,037
Do you have a headache?

181
00:43:58,767 --> 00:44:01,327
Take this, and you'll feel better.

182
00:44:03,487 --> 00:44:08,277
No? What, then?

183
00:44:20,767 --> 00:44:22,485
My photo?

184
00:44:22,807 --> 00:44:24,365
Take it.

185
00:44:55,887 --> 00:45:00,085
Already? Hang on.
I'll come with you.

186
00:45:51,527 --> 00:45:53,563
Fanta?
Is my bath ready?

187
00:46:17,047 --> 00:46:18,685
Diaby, the coffee is ready.

188
00:46:46,087 --> 00:46:47,645
You haven't made a stew today?

189
00:46:47,847 --> 00:46:50,998
I got out of bed late.

190
00:46:51,287 --> 00:46:54,962
Always the same!
This must not go on!

191
00:46:55,927 --> 00:46:58,122
I prefer stew, you know that.

192
00:47:05,927 --> 00:47:08,487
If God approves,
I shall go on a trip soon.

193
00:47:09,647 --> 00:47:10,682
Where will you go?

194
00:47:11,887 --> 00:47:13,161
I don't know.

195
00:47:21,847 --> 00:47:24,805
You remember...

196
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:29,165
I loaned money to Djakouraka

197
00:47:31,127 --> 00:47:34,676
No sign of him since.

198
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:40,440
He hasn't paid anything back to you?

199
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:44,486
No, he's going to make
me get it back myself.

200
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:47,478
You cannot trust people anymore.

201
00:47:52,287 --> 00:47:53,720
Give me a drink.

202
00:50:42,007 --> 00:50:43,565
Is the doctor in?

203
00:50:44,007 --> 00:50:44,996
Which one?

204
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:46,395
Doctor Diané.

205
00:50:46,607 --> 00:50:48,199
He's busy.

206
00:50:48,367 --> 00:50:50,278
I am Mrs. Diaby.

207
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:53,280
Wait your turn.

208
00:50:53,447 --> 00:50:55,039
Out of the question.

209
00:50:55,207 --> 00:50:58,643
I am in a hurry.

210
00:51:00,447 --> 00:51:04,998
Many people arrived here before you.
You'll have to wait.

211
00:51:05,167 --> 00:51:07,635
No, tell him I'm here.

212
00:51:07,807 --> 00:51:09,718
Very good, I will.

213
00:51:17,727 --> 00:51:21,561
I have taken all the medication.

214
00:51:27,487 --> 00:51:29,523
You have followed
Dr. Guindo's instructions?

215
00:51:30,847 --> 00:51:32,280
Madame, here is your doctor.

216
00:51:44,127 --> 00:51:46,482
What is the problem?

217
00:51:46,967 --> 00:51:48,764
I am worried.

218
00:51:48,927 --> 00:51:52,602
MY daughter is feverish...
and dizzy.

219
00:51:53,327 --> 00:51:56,444
I do not understand.

220
00:53:16,207 --> 00:53:19,005
Here's the prescription.

221
00:53:19,207 --> 00:53:22,882
Your daughter is pregnant.

222
00:55:18,687 --> 00:55:20,439
Ténin, who has done this to you?

223
00:55:23,167 --> 00:55:24,486
The scoundrel!

224
00:55:31,407 --> 00:55:34,365
You'll have to come clean
when your father gets home.

225
00:55:43,527 --> 00:55:45,006
You won't respond?

226
00:55:46,927 --> 00:55:48,246
Wicked girl!

227
00:55:49,647 --> 00:55:51,558
You have shamed us!

228
00:56:07,727 --> 00:56:09,877
You gave yourself to him?

229
00:56:10,407 --> 00:56:12,921
To that thug?

230
00:56:27,487 --> 00:56:31,241
What's this?
You've beaten her again?

231
00:56:35,367 --> 00:56:36,641
Sit down, Oumar.

232
00:56:44,367 --> 00:56:46,119
Why have you beaten her?

233
00:56:50,807 --> 00:56:52,286
Do you know him?

234
00:56:56,127 --> 00:56:59,005
This thug worked for me.

235
00:57:00,207 --> 00:57:02,243
What's this photo?

236
00:57:02,487 --> 00:57:04,159
It's her friend.

237
00:57:04,327 --> 00:57:06,795
So what? What can I do?

238
00:57:11,727 --> 00:57:14,287
He has impregnated her.

239
00:57:19,007 --> 00:57:20,884
What?

240
00:57:23,127 --> 00:57:25,197
She is three months pregnant.

241
00:57:33,167 --> 00:57:34,680
Are you listening, Oumar?

242
00:57:34,887 --> 00:57:36,400
This is above me.

243
00:58:01,647 --> 00:58:03,842
The world is huge.

244
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:08,075
Ténin can go where she wishes.

245
00:58:09,367 --> 00:58:12,677
But she will never
darken my doorway again.

246
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:22,841
Excuse me, Oumar.

247
00:58:32,447 --> 00:58:34,756
Calm down, Diaby.

248
00:58:37,727 --> 00:58:39,319
Accursed wretch!

249
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:43,605
She who bears
the honor of her family!

250
00:58:43,767 --> 00:58:45,598
Calm yourself, sit down.

251
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:51,200
I have done so much for her.

252
00:58:51,647 --> 00:58:55,242
This is how I'm repaid.
My life is worth nothing.

253
00:58:55,447 --> 00:58:58,325
Get ahold of yourself, Diaby.
Do not avoid the truth...

254
00:58:58,487 --> 00:59:03,083
that God sends you.
Listen to me, calm yourself.

255
00:59:03,247 --> 00:59:06,125
It's so hard to see her alive...

256
00:59:06,807 --> 00:59:11,437
that one begins
to think of her death.

257
00:59:12,567 --> 00:59:16,321
Oumar, you know me.
All that I possess...

258
00:59:16,847 --> 00:59:20,237
I have shared with her.
Here I am well paid.

259
00:59:20,727 --> 00:59:24,083
I prefer killing her
to seeing her like this.

260
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:26,517
Justice shall decide my fate.

261
00:59:27,047 --> 00:59:28,241
God creates children.

262
00:59:28,407 --> 00:59:33,037
But we, the parents,
are left to mold them.

263
00:59:33,847 --> 00:59:35,280
What do you mean?

264
00:59:35,607 --> 00:59:38,326
Make of your
daughter a tax collector...

265
00:59:38,847 --> 00:59:40,883
and she will tax you.

266
00:59:41,527 --> 00:59:43,358
You have spoiled Ténin.

267
00:59:43,527 --> 00:59:46,564
You have given her too much freedom.

268
00:59:46,727 --> 00:59:49,036
Do not be amazed.

269
00:59:49,207 --> 00:59:52,563
This was bound to happen.

270
00:59:58,487 --> 01:00:02,162
But it's not what I wanted for her.

271
01:00:03,047 --> 01:00:06,403
Diaby must visit Sekou's parents.

272
01:00:06,567 --> 01:00:08,637
He will marry Ténin.

273
01:00:08,847 --> 01:00:12,601
That's crazy! Marry that thug?

274
01:00:13,287 --> 01:00:14,800
Not while I'm still living.

275
01:00:14,967 --> 01:00:16,719
Who else will marry her?

276
01:00:17,927 --> 01:00:19,679
It's just like you.

277
01:00:19,887 --> 01:00:24,085
Like mother, like daughter.

278
01:00:26,727 --> 01:00:28,160
Me, a whore?

279
01:00:28,407 --> 01:00:31,319
You didn't know that?

280
01:00:31,527 --> 01:00:35,122
Well I became one in your house.

281
01:00:36,647 --> 01:00:39,639
Do you think
I'm fooled by your trips?

282
01:00:39,847 --> 01:00:42,805
I will continue to
go see my parents.

283
01:00:50,367 --> 01:00:54,326
I said nothing,
but I knew what to think.

284
01:00:58,767 --> 01:01:01,122
Shut up or I'll kill you!

285
01:01:06,087 --> 01:01:10,000
Calm yourself, Diaby.

286
01:01:14,327 --> 01:01:15,806
God watches over me.

287
01:01:15,967 --> 01:01:17,116
She will be silenced!

288
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:26,360
Well, shall I kill myself?

289
01:03:45,007 --> 01:03:48,158
Diaby, your brothers are here.

290
01:03:56,767 --> 01:03:58,564
Tell them I'm coming.

291
01:04:39,927 --> 01:04:43,442
Amadou, I have called you
together this evening...

292
01:04:46,527 --> 01:04:51,078
in order to tell you
something important.

293
01:04:52,887 --> 01:04:55,640
Something that cuts to my heart.

294
01:04:58,487 --> 01:05:01,160
God has already taken
my first son, Karim.

295
01:05:03,247 --> 01:05:07,206
All that I had,
I intended for him.

296
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:10,723
God has taken him back from me.

297
01:05:11,887 --> 01:05:17,519
I suffered then,
but not forever.

298
01:05:19,087 --> 01:05:22,238
I returned myself to God.

299
01:05:23,047 --> 01:05:25,561
The impossible has happened.

300
01:05:26,447 --> 01:05:30,156
It has happened in our house.

301
01:05:32,247 --> 01:05:36,399
Ténin is pregnant.

302
01:05:38,167 --> 01:05:39,919
We are dishonored.

303
01:05:40,967 --> 01:05:45,119
It is unacceptable for the family.

304
01:05:51,367 --> 01:05:55,758
Ténin may go where she wants.

305
01:05:57,607 --> 01:06:02,635
If she returns here,
it will be over my dead body.

306
01:06:03,607 --> 01:06:07,395
I ask you to have to same attitude.

307
01:06:08,607 --> 01:06:10,040
I warn you.

308
01:06:11,287 --> 01:06:15,883
If Ténin goes to your house,
it's over between us.

309
01:06:18,047 --> 01:06:19,605
That's what I had to say.

310
01:06:20,847 --> 01:06:23,315
Yaya, Amadou, Abdoulaye.
Have you heard well?

311
01:06:23,967 --> 01:06:28,040
Always look on the bright
side of things.

312
01:06:29,847 --> 01:06:32,042
But to each his own fate.

313
01:06:33,207 --> 01:06:37,041
I leave you at your word,
my brothers.

314
01:06:37,487 --> 01:06:39,842
Yaya, you heard what I told Amadou.

315
01:06:40,527 --> 01:06:43,405
Malamine has chosen drama...

316
01:06:43,767 --> 01:06:46,076
and destruction.

317
01:06:46,647 --> 01:06:49,605
Don't imitate him.

318
01:06:50,007 --> 01:06:52,680
God be with you.
That's all.

319
01:06:53,207 --> 01:06:57,166
You have heard what was said...

320
01:06:58,167 --> 01:07:00,442
on the subject of Ténin.

321
01:07:04,607 --> 01:07:09,965
Let us convince Malamine
to act calmly.

322
01:07:11,047 --> 01:07:14,881
Ténin has done badly,
but only against herself.

323
01:07:16,967 --> 01:07:19,845
If he has decided
to throw Ténin out...

324
01:07:20,327 --> 01:07:23,683
we must let her stay with us.

325
01:07:24,127 --> 01:07:28,279
Your place, lbrahim's
or mine.

326
01:07:30,847 --> 01:07:33,156
We cannot leave her on the street.

327
01:07:33,327 --> 01:07:35,397
Then we can return
to placating Malamine.

328
01:07:35,927 --> 01:07:39,761
The prophet himself grants prayers.

329
01:07:40,487 --> 01:07:44,321
Therefore a sensible
man is also a capable man.

330
01:07:44,607 --> 01:07:47,644
Malamine is our eldest,
he will understand.

331
01:07:53,527 --> 01:07:57,122
To disown Ténin is absurd.
She may leave...

332
01:07:57,367 --> 01:08:01,121
but her name will stay with her.

333
01:08:01,567 --> 01:08:03,956
That's all I wanted to add.

334
01:08:04,127 --> 01:08:06,277
No one could say it better.

335
01:08:06,887 --> 01:08:10,084
I have nothing more to add.

336
01:08:10,247 --> 01:08:12,966
He stays to consult with
his intimate friend, Oumar.

337
01:08:22,287 --> 01:08:24,721
You speak without knowledge.

338
01:08:27,367 --> 01:08:29,835
I, Malamine Diaby,
never reverse...

339
01:08:30,247 --> 01:08:32,477
my decisions.

340
01:08:36,247 --> 01:08:38,886
Malamine, it's for me to decide.

341
01:08:39,967 --> 01:08:43,118
You are stubborn, Malamine.

342
01:08:44,207 --> 01:08:49,679
I have come to inform you,
and that's all.

343
01:08:49,847 --> 01:08:52,407
Listen to you father, Malamine!

344
01:08:52,567 --> 01:08:55,081
Otherwise be quiet!

345
01:08:58,087 --> 01:09:00,885
I knew you wouldn't agree.

346
01:09:03,887 --> 01:09:06,526
But I had to warn you.

347
01:09:10,567 --> 01:09:11,761
I'll be on my way.

348
01:09:18,127 --> 01:09:21,403
Help!
Malamine has gone crazy!

349
01:09:24,687 --> 01:09:27,326
Fatouma, warn Fanta,
he wants to kill his daughter.

350
01:12:04,407 --> 01:12:06,637
I make a note in my book...

351
01:12:06,807 --> 01:12:10,800
the date of my reports.

352
01:12:12,927 --> 01:12:15,395
You admit to having slept with her?

353
01:12:18,487 --> 01:12:19,840
Therefore the child is yours?

354
01:12:21,767 --> 01:12:24,918
That, I deny.

355
01:12:26,967 --> 01:12:30,277
She did not sleep only with me.

356
01:12:31,327 --> 01:12:34,797
Do you have proof?

357
01:12:43,087 --> 01:12:47,365
She was not a virgin.

358
01:12:47,527 --> 01:12:50,121
That's not true! That's impossible!

359
01:12:50,287 --> 01:12:52,517
She didn't go
around with anyone else.

360
01:12:53,687 --> 01:12:55,564
Do you know this by your daughter?

361
01:12:55,887 --> 01:12:57,400
Are you asking me that?

362
01:12:58,327 --> 01:13:00,557
It's she who told me!

363
01:13:00,767 --> 01:13:04,316
That day, you brought
her home by moped.

364
01:13:04,567 --> 01:13:09,163
It was April 13th,
Two o'clock, by the river.

365
01:13:09,567 --> 01:13:12,559
She was still trembling
as she told me.

366
01:13:15,847 --> 01:13:17,246
Interesting...

367
01:13:22,847 --> 01:13:25,407
For a mute, she...

368
01:13:25,567 --> 01:13:27,319
gives plenty of details.

369
01:13:27,487 --> 01:13:30,877
You forget that I'm her mother.

370
01:13:32,567 --> 01:13:33,841
Watch your mouth.

371
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:37,961
Where do you think you are?

372
01:13:41,287 --> 01:13:44,996
Excuse me, Madame,
he speaks like a child.

373
01:13:46,367 --> 01:13:48,483
He says whatever
comes into his head.

374
01:13:48,647 --> 01:13:52,322
That's no child.

375
01:13:52,487 --> 01:13:55,160
He knows what he said.

376
01:13:55,847 --> 01:13:57,439
But he doesn't
give a damn about me.

377
01:13:57,927 --> 01:14:01,522
Leave me to it, Madame,
I'm going to lock him up.

378
01:14:02,207 --> 01:14:04,437
That will put his ideas
in their place.

379
01:14:12,047 --> 01:14:13,446
Lock him up until further notice.

380
01:14:13,607 --> 01:14:16,644
No, inspector,
don't do that.

381
01:14:16,927 --> 01:14:19,885
There has been enough
unhappiness like that.

382
01:14:20,127 --> 01:14:25,804
I simply want him, one day,

383
01:14:25,967 --> 01:14:28,765
to acknowledge his child.

384
01:14:29,607 --> 01:14:30,881
Stop!

385
01:14:32,767 --> 01:14:33,882
Come back!

386
01:14:36,647 --> 01:14:38,000
Did you hear what she said?

387
01:14:38,927 --> 01:14:39,837
Yes.

388
01:14:41,087 --> 01:14:43,043
It will be as you wish, Madame.

389
01:14:51,887 --> 01:14:55,562
But you, be careful.

390
01:14:56,687 --> 01:15:01,363
I'll cuff you the
first chance I get!

391
01:15:04,727 --> 01:15:08,163
You'll see him again someday.
He is capable of the worst.

392
01:15:08,327 --> 01:15:11,046
Get out, hoodlum!

393
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:17,801
Madame, you may leave.

394
01:15:17,967 --> 01:15:18,956
Thank you.

395
01:15:29,367 --> 01:15:31,961
Give yourself to a thug!

396
01:15:32,127 --> 01:15:36,837
Not even capable of
acknowledging a child!

397
01:15:37,727 --> 01:15:39,001
Your life won't amount to anything.

398
01:15:39,927 --> 01:15:41,360
Go on, disappear!

399
01:15:49,767 --> 01:15:52,964
Didn't you hear me?
You disgust me! Leave!

400
01:17:45,447 --> 01:17:47,358
You are very beautiful today.

401
01:18:14,287 --> 01:18:15,561
Who is it?

402
01:18:16,287 --> 01:18:17,561
A mute.

403
01:22:31,167 --> 01:22:32,725
Alas, my God!

404
01:22:32,927 --> 01:22:35,919
Alas my brother,
what's happening to him?

405
01:22:38,767 --> 01:22:41,679
Misfortune is immense,
but it does not measure up to God.

406
01:22:42,047 --> 01:22:44,845
God's design is obscure.

407
01:22:45,247 --> 01:22:47,966
God reunites us in joy.

408
01:22:48,527 --> 01:22:51,963
Ténin has killed herself
and left us here.

409
01:22:52,127 --> 01:22:55,802
Everywhere one cries Ténin!

410
01:22:56,847 --> 01:22:59,645
Ténin is dead!
