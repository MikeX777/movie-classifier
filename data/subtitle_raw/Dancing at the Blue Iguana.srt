1
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:46,004
Yes, I'll hold.

2
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:48,632
Uncle Neil?

3
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,677
Hi, it's Jessica.

4
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:54,805
How are you?

5
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:58,767
Really?

6
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:03,856
Yeah, I'm in Hollywood.

7
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:15,701
So what have you been doing
for the past five years?

8
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:25,252
Yeah?

9
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:33,218
I miss you.

10
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:37,681
A lot.

11
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:42,477
When can I come
and visit you?

12
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:49,484
Can you come
and visit me?

13
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:52,779
I'd love it
if you came and visited me.

14
00:01:56,408 --> 00:01:59,328
I don't care about that.

15
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:03,290
It doesn't matter anymore.
I just want to see you.

16
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:09,713
Okay, I'll try.

17
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,677
Are you ready?

18
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,988
Yes... okay.

19
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,658
Bye.

20
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:39,988
Heather,
can I get a beer?

21
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,324
- You got money?
- I do.

22
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:45,202
- How are you doing?
- Haven't seen you in a while.

23
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:47,496
I haven't been
around in a while.

24
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:49,540
I've been keeping an eye
on the cover of Rolling Stone

25
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:53,126
- and haven't seen you there either.
- Keep watching.

26
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:55,963
- Excuse me.

27
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:04,596
Mr. Black Cloud.

28
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:12,187
How are you doing?

29
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:15,148
Okay.
How are you?

30
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:18,944
- I want to talk to you.
- I want to talk to you too.

31
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,821
- Hey Bobby,
- Yeah?

32
00:05:20,863 --> 00:05:23,407
Look at this one
that Paulina showed me.

33
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:27,578
I don't know how to get
into it very gracefully.

34
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:30,831
Bobby:
That's real sexy.

35
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:32,958
I like that.

36
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,252
- You do?
- Yeah.

37
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:39,298
Make sure this guy pays you
before you show him any tit.

38
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:43,302
- Are we open?
- Yes, ma'am, we are.

39
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:44,636
- We are?
- Yes.

40
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,930
Fuck,
I have to get dressed!

41
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:49,308
Look at the difference
between that eye and that eye.

42
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:52,811
That's a half centimeter more.
And you can't put that out.

43
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:55,689
- Has anybody seen Jo?
- No, but her shit's here.

44
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:58,233
She went outside.
Probably sucking some guy's cock.

45
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,694
Tell her
to come in the office.

46
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:04,156
Tell her yourself.
Probably sucking some guy's cock.

47
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:06,742
Woman:
Simone's going up for me.

48
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:09,286
Whatever happens outside
this club is none of my business.

49
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,913
But what happens in here, is.

50
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:12,539
If he gives you
any shit, let me know.

51
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:15,751
- I'm in control.
- You're in control.

52
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:19,880
- I'm just trying to get unstoned.
- Hurry up.

53
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:21,590
Bobby:
Get dressed, please.

54
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:33,477
Oh, fuck!

55
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:41,068
I'm getting signed right now, so-

56
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:45,864
- Congratulations.
- Finally turning around.

57
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:48,075
That's so good,
because I need money.

58
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:51,328
I need to be able to get
things for the little boy,

59
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,956
- or the little girl-
- Listen.

60
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:56,959
I really want to party.
You know?

61
00:06:57,042 --> 00:07:00,379
Okay, can we not party
for a couple of days?

62
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:05,050
Because if we meet with
this lady and you're not high,

63
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,177
then she'll think
we're both stable

64
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:09,221
and you can tell her
you're going to get a deal

65
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:12,641
- and make a lot of money-
- Am I going to sign something?

66
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:16,228
Uh... no. Well, you might
have to sign something,

67
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:18,981
but you can use
a fake name if you

68
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:21,567
- know the social security number-
- Wait, so I sign something,

69
00:07:21,692 --> 00:07:24,528
and you'll get
a full-grown child?

70
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:28,115
No, he would be a six
or seven-year-old, probably.

71
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:29,825
Okay.

72
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,410
- I'll do it.
- Really?

73
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:33,579
Oh, thank you,
Charlie.

74
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,081
Check this out, Bobby.

75
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:37,416
Nico.

76
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:38,959
Yeah,
Carrie Crawford?

77
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:41,128
Eddie Hazel,
from the Blue Iguana.

78
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:43,338
Right, down in LA.

79
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:48,677
We'd like to get Nico in for a party
we're having next week.

80
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:54,141
She'd be a great addition
to our program as a feature dancer.

81
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:56,894
She has time
in her schedule?

82
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:00,355
Yeah,
we're real happy.

83
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,943
Give me a call back.
My number's 937-4444.

84
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:07,279
Eddie Hazel.
Blue Iguana.

85
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:09,740
Okay,
I'll talk to you then.

86
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,827
This ain't going
to be cheap.

87
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:16,288
I ain't worried
about cheap, baby.

88
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:20,709
We'll fill this club, she's
getting 300 to 400 guys a night.

89
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,669
There's a reason why.

90
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:26,423
My, oh my,
we got us a full house.

91
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:29,301
- Good day.
- How are you doing?

92
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:31,595
- Thank you.
- Be sure to make money.

93
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,597
I don't want you
getting used to this.

94
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:36,183
Come by later,
I've got to talk to you.

95
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:38,352
- This is for you.
- Thanks for your help.

96
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:40,354
Where's Jo?

97
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:41,980
I think she went outside.

98
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:45,442
- Hey, Eddie.
- Where the fuck have you been?

99
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:47,486
What do you mean, where
the fuck have I been? I'm here!

100
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:49,488
- My shit is here.
- Put that out.

101
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:51,782
Woman #2:
Thank you for the flower.

102
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:54,201
Jo:
Where's my flower?

103
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:59,289
- Thank you, sweetheart!
- Don't think it's gonna be that easy.

104
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:00,499
You come in here late,

105
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:02,167
- acting up, smoking.
- Fuck you, fuck you.

106
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:04,711
- Fuck you.
- Yeah, okay.

107
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:06,797
You'll get it later,
if you're good.

108
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:08,715
I was sick, Eddie.
I was sick.

109
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:11,718
Shut up,
you fucking hyena!

110
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:15,180
I would appreciate if you didn't
get all over that black guy.

111
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:17,683
- He's one of my regulars.
- The one with the Jheri-Curl?

112
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:19,768
- That's one of your regulars?
- Yes, it is.

113
00:09:19,852 --> 00:09:21,770
He's such
a fucking freak.

114
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,189
I would appreciate
if you took that guy back,

115
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:25,858
'cause he's just an asshole.

116
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:29,361
Let me give you a suggestion.
You should get a titjob.

117
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:38,036
Eddie:
Get off. Come here!

118
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,669
- Jo:... take that money-
- Shut the fuck up!

119
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:48,922
I will
suspend both of you.

120
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:50,465
And don't call my bluff!

121
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:53,218
Thank you. It's jealousy.

122
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,293
Can you believe that?

123
00:10:36,512 --> 00:10:38,847
I got my own.

124
00:10:38,931 --> 00:10:41,850
I'll show you how
it's done, all right, boy?

125
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,347
Yeah?

126
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:24,309
Oh, fuck!
What time is it?

127
00:11:24,393 --> 00:11:30,858
No, I forgot. Okay? I forgot.
No, I have it.

128
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,360
No, I'll be there
in 10 minutes.

129
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:35,070
All right.

130
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:42,828
- Hey, Johnny.
- How are you doing?

131
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:44,955
- Do you have the money?
- Yeah. Here you go.

132
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,875
What the fuck is this?
I told you 40.

133
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,294
- No, you didn't tell me 40.
- I told you 40.

134
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:54,339
Are you all right?

135
00:11:56,425 --> 00:11:59,344
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

136
00:11:59,428 --> 00:12:02,264
- Where's the rest of my money?
- I'll give it to you next week.

137
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:05,225
- See you later.
- Fuck it!

138
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:26,497
Two.

139
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,958
You got them
from in there?

140
00:12:30,042 --> 00:12:31,668
$2.00 each.

141
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:34,004
I know you.

142
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:36,465
You dance at the Blue Iguana.
Right? I just saw you there.

143
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:39,343
- Yeah.
- What's your name? Jasmine?

144
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,220
- Mm-hm.
- Jorge.

145
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:44,056
- Hi, Jorge. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

146
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:46,183
- I remember your name.
- Will you come by again?

147
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:49,019
- Yeah, I should be there soon.
- Can I have my books?

148
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,813
Thanks.
Bye, handsome. Say hi.

149
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:53,315
I will.

150
00:12:55,651 --> 00:12:57,277
I know that girl.

151
00:12:57,361 --> 00:12:59,238
I didn't know
you went to strip clubs?

152
00:12:59,363 --> 00:13:02,366
- What are you talking about?
- She's a stripper.

153
00:13:02,491 --> 00:13:07,454
- She comes to my poetry readings.
- No, she dances at the Blue Iguana.

154
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:08,497
She's a stripper.

155
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:11,500
Why don't you go
in the back and stack?

156
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,126
All right.

157
00:13:14,253 --> 00:13:19,174
- She said I was handsome.
- Hey, big day!

158
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,693
This is Eddie Hazel,
from the Blue Iguana.

159
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:42,030
I wanted to invite you to a party
here this Saturday night...

160
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,825
- Hi, Jessie, I'm Bobby.
- I'm here for the audition.

161
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:48,245
- You're late.
- I'm sorry. I like your hair.

162
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,247
It's very snazzy.

163
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:54,918
- Okay, thanks.
- Hello, Mr. Hazel.

164
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:56,795
- How are you?
- My name's Jessie.

165
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,339
- I'm here for the audition.
- All right. Nice.

166
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:02,050
- I like your glasses.
- Thank you.

167
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:06,346
- Have you danced before?
- I danced at Cheetahs for six months.

168
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:08,432
Do you have a pen?

169
00:14:08,557 --> 00:14:10,475
Do you have an ID?

170
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:14,062
I don't have it on me.
It's at the apartment.

171
00:14:14,188 --> 00:14:15,814
Eddie:
We'll need to see some ID.

172
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:20,569
We've got all kinds
of vice people, ABC coming in.

173
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:22,696
Are you planning on
stabbing someone tonight?

174
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:26,074
- No.
- It's a joke.

175
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,244
- This is soft.
- So...

176
00:14:29,328 --> 00:14:31,538
Where did you get this?

177
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:35,501
Bobby:
Jimmy, put it on.

178
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:39,838
Hi.

179
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:41,131
I'm okay. And you?

180
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:42,633
Good.

181
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,546
Yeah.

182
00:15:20,671 --> 00:15:22,714
We open up at 7:00.

183
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,424
We'll put you in the line-up.

184
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:27,845
Don't forget your ID.

185
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:31,223
Thank you, Eddie.
I'll see you tonight.

186
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:35,435
We run a tightjoint here.

187
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,815
No drugs, no hand jobs,
no blowjobs and no fucking.

188
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,484
You are so handsome.

189
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,278
- Did anyone ever tell you that?
- Thank you.

190
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:46,071
Yeah, I get it all the time.

191
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:48,365
Brad Pitt's got nothing on me.

192
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:51,243
- I think you're a doll.
- That's fine.

193
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:54,663
The word angle is spelled,

194
00:15:54,746 --> 00:16:00,460
A- N-G-L-E,

195
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:04,882
whilst the word angel is spelled,

196
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:10,762
- A-N-G-E-L.
- Angle.

197
00:16:10,888 --> 00:16:14,474
- Angle.
- Angle.

198
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,060
- Angel.
- Angel.

199
00:16:21,315 --> 00:16:23,150
How many nights?

200
00:16:23,275 --> 00:16:24,776
One.

201
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:28,780
It's 30 plus tax,
that is $34.20.

202
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:35,954
Hello!

203
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,749
LA paper.
Complimentary.

204
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:10,697
Tape:
Listen and check your answers.

205
00:17:10,781 --> 00:17:13,242
Practice saying them.

206
00:17:13,325 --> 00:17:17,704
He wears a uniform.
- He wears a uniform.

207
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:23,544
She's a pilot.
She flies all over the world.

208
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:28,215
- She's a pilot-
- Angel!

209
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:32,928
In winter, Alice goes skiing,

210
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:35,556
and in summer, she plays golf...

211
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:45,274
Ladies and gentlemen,
she fell from the sky.

212
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:48,443
The celestial Angel.

213
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,583
Whoo!

214
00:18:15,387 --> 00:18:19,141
You know? Excuse me? Hi.

215
00:18:19,224 --> 00:18:21,393
You're sitting in someone's seat.

216
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:24,021
It's Angel's seat.
Why don't you sit-

217
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:25,272
yeah, sit in Jo's seat.

218
00:18:25,397 --> 00:18:28,483
- I'm Jessie, by the way.
- Hi Jessie, I'm Jasmine.

219
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:31,612
You have beautiful lips.
Do you use collagen?

220
00:18:31,737 --> 00:18:33,322
No, they're natural.

221
00:18:34,406 --> 00:18:36,909
There's some freak hanging
outside in a green Cadillac.

222
00:18:36,992 --> 00:18:38,994
- I saw him.
- Did you see him?

223
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:40,662
That's fucking freaky.

224
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:42,456
We ought to tell Bobby,
to get him-

225
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:45,209
- I saw him twice last week.
- Stormy, did you see him?

226
00:18:45,334 --> 00:18:46,376
No.

227
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,253
- Is he there now?
- Yeah.

228
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:50,797
Remember that
guy who followed me home?

229
00:18:50,881 --> 00:18:52,758
- Don't go out there.
- I'll be right back.

230
00:18:52,883 --> 00:18:54,843
- Don't go outside.
- I want to see who it is.

231
00:18:54,927 --> 00:18:57,429
If you talk to him,
tell him to fuck off.

232
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:45,477
I don't fucking believe this.

233
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:46,979
Excuse me? Honey?

234
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,647
New girl? Barbie?

235
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:51,108
You're sitting in my seat.
This is my seat.

236
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:54,528
You might notice
there's stuff in front of it?

237
00:19:54,653 --> 00:19:56,363
There's a jacket on the back of it.

238
00:19:56,488 --> 00:19:58,323
Jasmine, how could
you let her sit in my seat?

239
00:19:58,448 --> 00:20:00,576
- Don't talk to me.
- Find your own space.

240
00:20:00,701 --> 00:20:03,787
Find your own space,
and we'll all get along.

241
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:30,480
You know that guy
who looks like Colonel Sanders?

242
00:20:30,606 --> 00:20:33,066
- He gave me some bud and I-
- Hey, bitch, you're up!

243
00:20:33,192 --> 00:20:36,778
- I just came off stage!
- Not you, cornflake,

244
00:20:36,862 --> 00:20:38,197
I'm talking to Jasmine.

245
00:20:38,322 --> 00:20:40,949
Jasmine, it's your turn.
I'm not going up.

246
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:43,702
I'm not ready.
I have to let my rubber breathe.

247
00:20:43,827 --> 00:20:46,663
- Jasmine:... they're saying Jo.
- They're not.

248
00:20:46,747 --> 00:20:48,832
- I can't go. I'm not ready.
- I'll go.

249
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:53,128
You'll go for me?
You'll do that for me?

250
00:20:53,212 --> 00:20:55,756
You're a really sweet girl.
You know that?

251
00:20:55,881 --> 00:20:58,675
She's Jessie.
She's our new addition.

252
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,302
She gets along with everybody.

253
00:21:00,427 --> 00:21:02,763
We love little Jessie here.

254
00:21:02,888 --> 00:21:05,224
Go on up.
You're gonna miss your-

255
00:21:39,424 --> 00:21:41,885
And now,
making her stage debut...

256
00:21:41,969 --> 00:21:45,389
she's young, she's beautiful,
she's perfection.

257
00:21:45,514 --> 00:21:49,393
Ladies and gentlemen, put
your hands together for Jessie!

258
00:22:30,475 --> 00:22:32,978
Just wondering.
Did you ever get her ID?

259
00:22:34,605 --> 00:22:36,398
Yes, I know who she is.

260
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:38,901
I talked to Billy.

261
00:22:51,997 --> 00:22:54,208
Did that call from Nico come yet?

262
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:55,792
It's on the machine.

263
00:22:55,918 --> 00:22:58,921
Come on, Bobby, you said
you were going to tell me.

264
00:22:59,046 --> 00:23:00,214
Mm-hm.

265
00:23:00,339 --> 00:23:01,548
I'm telling you.

266
00:24:02,401 --> 00:24:05,904
Hi, Eddie Hazel,

267
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:09,491
this is Nico.
So it looks like we're on, baby.

268
00:24:09,616 --> 00:24:13,620
I'll be there.
You have my numbers. Bye.

269
00:24:47,196 --> 00:24:50,657
Are you okay?
You doing okay, kid?

270
00:24:52,784 --> 00:24:54,411
My glasses, my glasses.

271
00:24:54,536 --> 00:24:55,829
Why don't you take them off?

272
00:24:55,954 --> 00:24:59,374
We'll put them right here.
Are you okay with that?

273
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,377
All right, sweetie.
Okay, how's that?

274
00:25:02,461 --> 00:25:04,046
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

275
00:25:04,129 --> 00:25:05,464
Want to see the bad side?

276
00:25:05,547 --> 00:25:09,259
- All right. Here we go.
- Oh God.

277
00:25:12,763 --> 00:25:14,056
Hi.

278
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:16,850
Jessie.

279
00:25:20,646 --> 00:25:22,731
- Want to dance tonight?
- Mmm.

280
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:24,483
Let's go.

281
00:25:47,089 --> 00:25:49,508
I don't have any money for this.

282
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:51,760
I'll make an exception.

283
00:26:01,061 --> 00:26:02,479
Listen to this.

284
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:31,884
That's not the message I saved.

285
00:27:36,281 --> 00:27:38,450
Woman:
I realize our ancestral humor

286
00:27:38,575 --> 00:27:41,411
goes through common
longing and resistance.

287
00:27:41,495 --> 00:27:44,331
I know the effort
you will not make

288
00:27:44,456 --> 00:27:49,127
until you are ready
to accept I am not a war.

289
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:52,297
That was great!

290
00:27:52,381 --> 00:27:54,174
Greatjob.
Thank you, Fiona.

291
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:58,095
I forgot to mention earlier,
we put some fliers on the chairs

292
00:27:58,178 --> 00:28:00,931
referring to the upcoming
poetry slam in San Francisco.

293
00:28:01,014 --> 00:28:03,100
As you know,
it is the most important

294
00:28:03,183 --> 00:28:06,186
poetry event on the West Coast
so be sure to check it out.

295
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:09,940
Now, without further ado,
I'd like to bring up Sophie Delvaux,

296
00:28:10,023 --> 00:28:13,235
whose latest collection,
"Autumn Sopranos,"

297
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,405
will soon be published
by the Hubcap Poets Library.

298
00:28:16,488 --> 00:28:19,575
Sophie.

299
00:28:23,579 --> 00:28:25,747
"Dreamboat.

300
00:28:25,873 --> 00:28:29,710
Sleep is a boat moored
in this room at night

301
00:28:29,835 --> 00:28:32,129
And again at dawn.

302
00:28:32,212 --> 00:28:36,300
In between,
itjourneys over the world,

303
00:28:36,383 --> 00:28:40,179
Travels inside
the scheme of things,

304
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:43,473
Moves out over the stars,

305
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:47,853
Comes, sailing into port,
its cargo... "

306
00:28:49,646 --> 00:28:51,106
You never read.

307
00:28:52,566 --> 00:28:54,109
No.

308
00:28:55,611 --> 00:28:57,613
So what's that on your paper?

309
00:28:57,738 --> 00:29:00,824
- Your laundry list?
- Mm-hmm.

310
00:29:01,992 --> 00:29:04,620
Maybe you should come
and read your laundry list.

311
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,459
Maybe not.

312
00:29:10,542 --> 00:29:12,711
- Hey.
- Hey, baby.

313
00:29:12,836 --> 00:29:14,838
- Hey, Stormy?
- Yeah.

314
00:29:14,963 --> 00:29:17,633
You don't know
a Marie Hughes, do you?

315
00:29:19,468 --> 00:29:21,929
Marie Hughes, ring a bell?

316
00:29:22,054 --> 00:29:23,847
- What is that?
- I don't know.

317
00:29:23,972 --> 00:29:27,476
Some attorney type dropped
it off for her about 10 minutes ago.

318
00:29:28,602 --> 00:29:30,354
I'll give it to her.

319
00:29:30,479 --> 00:29:32,648
No, I'll give it to her.
Do you know who it is?

320
00:29:32,731 --> 00:29:35,901
- Yeah, it's me.
- You?

321
00:29:35,984 --> 00:29:37,736
Fan mail?

322
00:29:39,154 --> 00:29:42,366
Use your stage name,
not your real name.

323
00:29:43,867 --> 00:29:45,327
You hear me?

324
00:30:04,972 --> 00:30:07,057
Oh my God.

325
00:30:21,363 --> 00:30:23,448
Oh my God.

326
00:31:01,361 --> 00:31:04,031
- I think I'm pregnant.
- No, you're not.

327
00:31:04,156 --> 00:31:06,742
Yeah, look at this.

328
00:31:06,825 --> 00:31:09,661
- What the fuck is that?
- It's at the plus.

329
00:31:09,786 --> 00:31:13,123
- That means you're pregnant.
- Where did you get this?

330
00:31:13,207 --> 00:31:14,208
In the bathroom.

331
00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:18,295
I was peeing and I found it
beneath the toilet.

332
00:31:18,378 --> 00:31:20,380
Did you piss on it?

333
00:31:20,506 --> 00:31:23,342
Well, I was standing-
I was hovering

334
00:31:23,467 --> 00:31:24,927
because the toilet is gross.

335
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:27,304
So I was peeing
and I looked down

336
00:31:27,387 --> 00:31:29,473
and I saw this
right beneath the toilet.

337
00:31:29,598 --> 00:31:32,392
And I think
I might have dribbled on it.

338
00:31:32,476 --> 00:31:35,145
Did you piss on the thing?

339
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:37,314
- There's piss on it...
- That's gross.

340
00:31:37,439 --> 00:31:39,566
and I might have dribbled on it...

341
00:31:39,691 --> 00:31:41,610
- You're not fucking anyone.
- Nobody right now,

342
00:31:41,693 --> 00:31:43,695
but I heard
on the Discovery Channel

343
00:31:43,821 --> 00:31:45,739
that sperm
can live a long time.

344
00:31:45,781 --> 00:31:47,699
When was the last
time you fucked anyone?

345
00:31:48,951 --> 00:31:50,661
- Six or seven months.
- That is not yours.

346
00:31:50,744 --> 00:31:52,871
- Kathy, this is yours?
- No, it's not mine.

347
00:31:52,996 --> 00:31:54,706
- Tiffany?
- No, it's not mine.

348
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:56,250
- See, it's mine.
- No, it's not.

349
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:59,670
- This isn't yours, right?
- You didn't piss on it,

350
00:31:59,795 --> 00:32:02,756
- you're not fucking anyone.
- I've been wanting to get pregnant.

351
00:32:02,881 --> 00:32:07,594
- Jessie, is this yours?
- Get off of my things.

352
00:32:07,719 --> 00:32:09,972
- I'd appreciate it.
- Jo?

353
00:32:12,683 --> 00:32:14,560
Where's Stormy?

354
00:32:27,614 --> 00:32:29,950
- I want to keep it.
- Angel, don't!

355
00:32:30,075 --> 00:32:32,870
Why do you want to keep it?
Someone pissed on that.

356
00:32:32,995 --> 00:32:33,579
It's not yours.

357
00:32:36,874 --> 00:32:40,752
Okay, kids, go to town!

358
00:32:40,836 --> 00:32:42,921
Whoo!

359
00:32:55,517 --> 00:32:57,936
Stormy, what do you get
for a blowjob?

360
00:32:59,938 --> 00:33:02,024
$100.

361
00:33:03,192 --> 00:33:05,235
Okay.

362
00:33:30,344 --> 00:33:34,973
- Give it to me. Is this yours?
- What is it?

363
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,934
I don't know
what the fuck it is.

364
00:33:37,017 --> 00:33:39,353
It stinks.
Get it away from me.

365
00:33:39,436 --> 00:33:42,397
- Sit down.
- What?

366
00:33:42,481 --> 00:33:44,816
- Are you pregnant?
- What?

367
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,485
Are you pregnant?

368
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:48,487
What the fuck
is the matter with you?

369
00:33:48,612 --> 00:33:51,782
Do I look like I'm pregnant?
No, I'm not.

370
00:33:51,865 --> 00:33:54,660
- What's going on?
- Angel found it and thinks it's hers.

371
00:33:54,743 --> 00:33:58,121
- But it's obviously not hers.
- Angel found it. It's probably hers.

372
00:33:58,247 --> 00:34:04,211
Angel, honey, are you pregnant?
Congratulations, baby!

373
00:34:04,336 --> 00:34:06,505
You'll make
such a good mother.

374
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:08,340
Just don't leave
the baby in the park.

375
00:34:08,382 --> 00:34:10,384
Jo, sit down.

376
00:34:10,467 --> 00:34:13,095
Look at me, will you?
Are you pregnant?

377
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:16,390
- No.
- How late are you?

378
00:34:16,515 --> 00:34:18,225
I'm not late.

379
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:20,894
I'm not late.
I'm not late.

380
00:34:21,019 --> 00:34:24,898
- Give it to me!
- Keep your hands off of my pills!

381
00:34:32,823 --> 00:34:36,577
Fuck! What the fuck
is the matter with you people?

382
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:39,788
- How late are you?
- I'm not late, okay?

383
00:34:39,913 --> 00:34:42,040
All right, I got-

384
00:34:42,166 --> 00:34:44,042
give me this.

385
00:34:47,588 --> 00:34:50,549
- What does that mean-
- It means you're pregnant.

386
00:34:50,632 --> 00:34:54,803
It's a plus, there's
a little blue plus sign right there.

387
00:34:54,887 --> 00:34:58,640
All right, I'm not a moron.
I read the box.

388
00:34:58,765 --> 00:35:01,685
- It's a plus sign, okay?
- Are you gonna keep it?

389
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:04,146
I'm not going to keep it.
I'm gonna throw it away.

390
00:35:04,271 --> 00:35:06,648
It's disgusting.
What do you think?

391
00:35:06,732 --> 00:35:08,442
If you want, I have a doctor.

392
00:35:08,525 --> 00:35:13,030
- I think I got a defective EPT...
- No, you did not.

393
00:35:13,155 --> 00:35:17,201
- because it was in my...
- It's so beautiful.

394
00:35:17,326 --> 00:35:21,580
Honey, I have a doctor in
Culver City who can take care of it.

395
00:35:21,705 --> 00:35:23,248
Okay.

396
00:35:23,373 --> 00:35:25,042
Can you make
an appointment for me?

397
00:35:25,167 --> 00:35:26,835
'Cause I don't want to
carry it around.

398
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,253
It's okay.

399
00:35:31,006 --> 00:35:33,008
- Hey, Bobby.
- Hey.

400
00:35:34,092 --> 00:35:37,054
- Bobby, you seen Charlie?
- Yeah, I've seen him.

401
00:35:37,137 --> 00:35:39,056
He gave me a tip.

402
00:35:39,139 --> 00:35:41,058
Fucking asshole.

403
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:43,894
Where is he? I have to arrange
something with him.

404
00:35:43,977 --> 00:35:45,771
You really want to know?

405
00:35:45,896 --> 00:35:47,606
Yeah, why?
What happened?

406
00:35:47,731 --> 00:35:49,399
Come on,
let's go for a smoke.

407
00:35:49,525 --> 00:35:51,693
Why?
What happened?

408
00:35:53,987 --> 00:35:58,200
Asshole!
The motherfucker?

409
00:35:58,283 --> 00:36:00,994
- What am I supposed to do now?
- You'll be fine.

410
00:36:01,078 --> 00:36:02,579
What do you mean?

411
00:36:02,704 --> 00:36:05,207
He told me he was going to come
to the meeting with me.

412
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:08,460
I give him something and he was
going to be my fiancé,

413
00:36:08,502 --> 00:36:10,754
and he made me a promise.

414
00:36:10,879 --> 00:36:12,381
He said,
"I'm going to come with you,

415
00:36:12,464 --> 00:36:15,300
and then he goes off
with the first- fucking little-

416
00:36:15,425 --> 00:36:18,804
What, you need a leech?
Here, calm down.

417
00:36:18,929 --> 00:36:23,684
Fuck! I need him
to show I'm like

418
00:36:23,809 --> 00:36:26,937
a whole person who's going
to get married and stuff-

419
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:29,147
Sit down. Sit down.

420
00:36:29,231 --> 00:36:31,233
Relax.

421
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:33,986
Bobby...

422
00:36:34,069 --> 00:36:35,821
You can do better
than Charlie.

423
00:36:35,946 --> 00:36:37,322
Yeah, right.

424
00:36:37,447 --> 00:36:40,117
Some kid's going to be
lucky to have you as a mom.

425
00:36:40,242 --> 00:36:41,827
That's what
you got to remember.

426
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:43,662
He wasn't going
to be there with me.

427
00:36:43,787 --> 00:36:46,248
He was going
to go to the interview.

428
00:36:46,331 --> 00:36:49,084
Now what am I going to do?

429
00:36:49,168 --> 00:36:52,588
Let me look
at that tip he gave you.

430
00:36:55,841 --> 00:36:58,177
What are you doing?
That's my money.

431
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:00,721
- That's my money.
- That's Charlie's money.

432
00:37:00,804 --> 00:37:03,182
You can have this.

433
00:37:10,022 --> 00:37:11,190
I'll tell you what.

434
00:37:11,315 --> 00:37:14,860
I'm going to check with Eddie
and I'll give you a ride home.

435
00:37:14,902 --> 00:37:17,905
Don't be a long time, Bobby.

436
00:37:25,454 --> 00:37:28,540
Miss Willow?
You can come in now.

437
00:37:32,461 --> 00:37:36,089
Miss Willow, why do you
want to foster a child?

438
00:37:37,424 --> 00:37:41,386
Well, because
I really love children,

439
00:37:41,512 --> 00:37:45,307
and I really feel
that I could give them

440
00:37:45,432 --> 00:37:48,727
a safe and happy place to be

441
00:37:48,852 --> 00:37:50,229
while they're waiting
for their parents

442
00:37:50,312 --> 00:37:53,232
to get out of rehab orjail-

443
00:37:53,357 --> 00:37:56,109
Sometimes these kids do come

444
00:37:56,235 --> 00:37:58,445
from very disturbed backgrounds

445
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:01,740
and it's important to have
a safe and secure environment

446
00:38:01,782 --> 00:38:02,741
and someone with an open mind.

447
00:38:02,866 --> 00:38:05,661
Yeah, I have a very open mind.

448
00:38:05,786 --> 00:38:10,207
Yeah, like your sign that says,
"The hand of friendship has no color. "

449
00:38:10,249 --> 00:38:14,837
I don't look down on Michael Jackson
for changing the color of his skin.

450
00:38:14,962 --> 00:38:18,173
We have people in my building that are-

451
00:38:18,298 --> 00:38:21,051
there's three lesbians
living in one apartment.

452
00:38:21,134 --> 00:38:23,387
All of them sleep in the same bed

453
00:38:23,512 --> 00:38:26,265
and they're the most normal
people that you can ever meet.

454
00:38:26,348 --> 00:38:29,184
Even though they sleep together,
they're so nice.

455
00:38:29,268 --> 00:38:31,812
Oh, I'm sure they actually-

456
00:38:31,937 --> 00:38:36,567
you live in the same building,
so this is an apartment on Whitsett?

457
00:38:36,692 --> 00:38:39,069
- Spec.
- Spec. You moved.

458
00:38:39,194 --> 00:38:41,446
No, it's around
the corner from Whitsett.

459
00:38:41,572 --> 00:38:42,364
That was the direction.

460
00:38:42,447 --> 00:38:44,908
Okay. So-

461
00:38:45,033 --> 00:38:47,911
Okay, so how long have
you lived in Los Angeles?

462
00:38:48,036 --> 00:38:50,581
- For six years.
- And where did you grow up?

463
00:38:50,664 --> 00:38:53,500
- Oklahoma.
- You moved here from Oklahoma?

464
00:38:53,584 --> 00:38:57,671
- Six years from Oklahoma?
- No, I was in Vegas for a while.

465
00:38:57,796 --> 00:38:59,882
What were you doing in Vegas?

466
00:39:00,007 --> 00:39:02,301
- I was engaged.
- Did you get married?

467
00:39:02,426 --> 00:39:06,722
No. I would have, but
he didn't want to marry me

468
00:39:06,805 --> 00:39:07,973
because...

469
00:39:08,098 --> 00:39:11,768
he was a very wealthy man,
but he had some character flaws.

470
00:39:11,894 --> 00:39:14,605
What kind of character flaws?

471
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:17,274
He liked really young women.

472
00:39:17,399 --> 00:39:18,817
You're a beautiful woman.

473
00:39:18,901 --> 00:39:22,321
I can't imagine him finding
someone younger or more attractive.

474
00:39:22,446 --> 00:39:27,493
Well, thanks, but when I turned 25,
I was just kind of kicked out.

475
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,787
Do you have a significant other now?

476
00:39:30,913 --> 00:39:34,333
Mm-hm. Charlie.
He's my fiancé

477
00:39:34,458 --> 00:39:36,960
and he was going to
come with me today

478
00:39:37,085 --> 00:39:39,546
and I know you might
be worried that he's not here

479
00:39:39,671 --> 00:39:42,966
but he had a big record deal
and they needed him in New York

480
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:47,846
because he might be
doing some music with Yanni...

481
00:39:47,971 --> 00:39:50,224
- Oh.
- or some other people.

482
00:39:50,349 --> 00:39:53,268
That's very soulful.

483
00:39:53,352 --> 00:39:55,312
- Okay-
- He's very soulful.

484
00:39:56,897 --> 00:40:00,651
What do you fear most in life?

485
00:40:03,487 --> 00:40:06,156
- Death.
- What does that bring up for you?

486
00:40:07,533 --> 00:40:10,035
Not being able to live.

487
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,579
And what about
the most pleasurable thing?

488
00:40:13,747 --> 00:40:16,375
- Love.
- Love.

489
00:40:18,001 --> 00:40:20,629
- Miss Willow?
- Hm-hum?

490
00:40:20,754 --> 00:40:25,217
What do you think
you can give a child?

491
00:40:27,469 --> 00:40:31,849
Well, I have a Teddy bear
that I had when I was a kid.

492
00:40:31,932 --> 00:40:36,895
And I make a really good
fluffer-nutter sandwich.

493
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:40,732
You are-
you are very charming.

494
00:40:40,858 --> 00:40:43,402
I want you
to understand something.

495
00:40:43,569 --> 00:40:45,946
Fostering a child
is not a hobby

496
00:40:46,071 --> 00:40:48,740
- and it's not an activity-
- Oh no, I know.

497
00:40:48,782 --> 00:40:51,326
It's very serious.
It's an occupation.

498
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:53,620
It's a commitment
that you're going to make.

499
00:40:53,704 --> 00:40:54,955
I know, I understand.

500
00:40:55,038 --> 00:40:57,666
I have too many hobbies already,

501
00:40:57,791 --> 00:40:59,459
- so...
- Okay.

502
00:41:44,922 --> 00:41:46,173
Would you look at my ass?

503
00:41:46,298 --> 00:41:49,760
There's something in it.
Is it warts?

504
00:41:49,885 --> 00:41:51,845
- I don't want to have herpes.
- No, it's not.

505
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:53,347
You just cut your asshole, that's all.

506
00:41:53,472 --> 00:41:54,264
Just put a little...

507
00:41:54,348 --> 00:41:57,309
You might feel sorry for me
'cause I only made one dollar.

508
00:41:57,392 --> 00:41:59,186
- Ha!
- Oh, please!

509
00:41:59,311 --> 00:42:01,480
Jesus, Angel!

510
00:42:05,192 --> 00:42:07,194
Put some
aloe vera on that, Jasmine.

511
00:42:07,319 --> 00:42:09,738
I've been
thinking about little Jo,

512
00:42:09,822 --> 00:42:12,658
because it would
be really easy to remember.

513
00:42:12,699 --> 00:42:13,951
It's like your name.

514
00:42:14,076 --> 00:42:16,870
And it would be
good for a girl or a boy.

515
00:42:55,909 --> 00:42:58,495
Can I get your attention?
Don't forget.

516
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:02,040
Hello, Tiffany...
Party at my house

517
00:43:02,166 --> 00:43:03,208
the day after tomorrow
for the foster kid.

518
00:43:03,333 --> 00:43:05,085
Sometimes it takes a
while to find the right guy,

519
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:07,171
and people can piss
off people and the thing is-

520
00:43:07,254 --> 00:43:09,173
- Hello!
- What?

521
00:43:09,256 --> 00:43:12,342
We're getting my apartment ready for
my foster kid the day after tomorrow.

522
00:43:12,426 --> 00:43:16,221
I'll make a map so everyone knows
how to get to my apartment, okay?

523
00:43:25,647 --> 00:43:28,775
Man:
Remember these glasses?

524
00:43:28,901 --> 00:43:34,198
I was wondering if,
maybe, you could hold them

525
00:43:34,323 --> 00:43:38,577
while I straighten things out
with the landlord.

526
00:43:40,454 --> 00:43:42,372
Straighten it out?

527
00:43:42,456 --> 00:43:46,001
Those were my wife's.

528
00:43:46,084 --> 00:43:51,173
She loved them and it's
the only memento I got of her.

529
00:44:50,357 --> 00:44:53,652
That's Stormy!

530
00:44:58,657 --> 00:45:02,244
Eddie, Harry left
his binoculars for you.

531
00:45:04,913 --> 00:45:07,249
- Harry left these?
- Yeah.

532
00:45:09,084 --> 00:45:10,752
Thanks.

533
00:45:10,878 --> 00:45:12,754
- Hey, Desiree?
- Yeah?

534
00:45:14,006 --> 00:45:17,134
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

535
00:45:53,337 --> 00:45:57,216
Hi.
It's room 2-0-8.

536
00:45:59,051 --> 00:46:02,095
Yes. No,
I am not going.

537
00:46:03,639 --> 00:46:06,183
Yes, I stay
one more night.

538
00:46:19,488 --> 00:46:21,615
No, no problem.

539
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:23,408
You scared me.

540
00:46:33,293 --> 00:46:35,671
You want me
to get out of your way?

541
00:46:35,754 --> 00:46:37,756
No, I have
nowhere to go.

542
00:46:44,721 --> 00:46:47,641
- Light me one, will you?
- Yeah, sure.

543
00:47:00,654 --> 00:47:02,406
He's here, Bobby.

544
00:47:02,531 --> 00:47:03,490
Who?

545
00:47:04,908 --> 00:47:06,785
Sullivan.

546
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:08,245
Your brother?

547
00:47:10,789 --> 00:47:12,291
Yes.

548
00:47:18,338 --> 00:47:20,048
He wants me
to go see him.

549
00:47:20,132 --> 00:47:21,884
Mmm-hmm.

550
00:47:21,967 --> 00:47:24,386
He's staying
at the Sunset Hilton.

551
00:47:24,511 --> 00:47:25,596
You know where that is?

552
00:47:28,432 --> 00:47:30,100
Yeah. Yeah.

553
00:47:32,227 --> 00:47:34,062
He's getting married.

554
00:47:35,939 --> 00:47:37,816
He's going
to be a daddy.

555
00:47:38,901 --> 00:47:42,237
- You're going to be an aunt.
- Fuck you.

556
00:47:45,365 --> 00:47:47,534
Fuck no,
I don't want to see him.

557
00:47:50,954 --> 00:47:52,581
How did we do tonight?

558
00:47:54,291 --> 00:47:55,834
We did all right.

559
00:47:59,671 --> 00:48:01,673
Do you want some advice?

560
00:48:01,757 --> 00:48:03,300
Wait until Christmas,

561
00:48:03,425 --> 00:48:05,969
buy them all nice little gifts,
you go home,

562
00:48:06,094 --> 00:48:08,305
you take a picture
and you go home.

563
00:48:08,388 --> 00:48:09,848
I don't want your advice.

564
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:13,018
I want to see him.

565
00:48:15,187 --> 00:48:17,815
74 Fleetwood.

566
00:48:17,898 --> 00:48:20,859
We drove across the country
in that car.

567
00:48:20,943 --> 00:48:22,820
I always wanted to do that.

568
00:48:24,238 --> 00:48:26,448
Best memories of my life.

569
00:48:32,871 --> 00:48:34,790
- He's right there.
- Where?

570
00:48:34,873 --> 00:48:37,376
Right there.
My brother.

571
00:48:37,459 --> 00:48:39,795
- How do you know?
- I know.

572
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:45,259
I know he's on
the left side of the bed

573
00:48:45,342 --> 00:48:49,680
and he's smoking
a cigarette and thinking.

574
00:48:57,938 --> 00:48:59,356
I'm not going up.

575
00:48:59,481 --> 00:49:00,816
I don't want to go up.

576
00:49:04,361 --> 00:49:08,407
- You want to go back to my place?
- No, take me back to my car.

577
00:49:08,532 --> 00:49:10,325
All right.

578
00:49:13,829 --> 00:49:17,040
Okay, this is
an excellent guitar, so...

579
00:49:17,166 --> 00:49:18,625
Thank you.

580
00:49:25,215 --> 00:49:26,925
Baby, come here.

581
00:49:27,092 --> 00:49:30,345
You look great with this.
Here, let me tell you.

582
00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:32,097
You hear that sound?

583
00:49:32,181 --> 00:49:35,475
Yeah, this is a '59 Gibson Les Paul.

584
00:49:35,559 --> 00:49:38,937
There is more history
behind this instrument.

585
00:49:39,021 --> 00:49:41,398
You have to hold it
like a precious baby.

586
00:49:41,523 --> 00:49:43,942
Charlie:
Think baby Jesus.

587
00:49:44,026 --> 00:49:45,944
Jessie:
I have the goods.

588
00:49:47,696 --> 00:49:50,032
- I'm so proud of you.
- That'll be four, three,

589
00:49:50,157 --> 00:49:52,743
two, four, seven,
ninety-three. Cash?

590
00:49:52,826 --> 00:49:56,288
- Cash.
- That's cash. Take them.

591
00:49:56,413 --> 00:49:59,041
- Okay. Excellent.
- Are you happy?

592
00:49:59,166 --> 00:50:00,459
Thank you, baby.

593
00:51:26,628 --> 00:51:30,465
I got all this great
stuff at the 99 Cent Store

594
00:51:30,591 --> 00:51:32,259
and I thought-
Wake up!

595
00:51:32,342 --> 00:51:34,428
I got this really
great snorkel.

596
00:51:34,553 --> 00:51:36,763
The kid can use it
as a snorkel in this pool.

597
00:51:36,889 --> 00:51:39,057
Oh, that's so cute!

598
00:51:39,183 --> 00:51:40,434
Where's Jo?

599
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:41,894
Where's everybody?

600
00:51:41,977 --> 00:51:45,355
I think everybody
had an appointment.

601
00:51:45,481 --> 00:51:47,274
I haven't heard from anybody.

602
00:51:47,357 --> 00:51:51,320
You know that guy
who throws that shit up on stage?

603
00:51:51,445 --> 00:51:54,531
- Presents!
- Yeah, I need to wake up.

604
00:51:54,615 --> 00:51:56,909
So I think we should
smoke it right now.

605
00:51:56,992 --> 00:51:58,785
Yeah 'cause
we need to organize.

606
00:51:58,911 --> 00:52:00,787
We need to concentrate.

607
00:52:01,914 --> 00:52:06,835
- Did you move the couch?
- Yeah, I'm working on the feng shui.

608
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,879
What the fuck is feng shui?

609
00:52:09,004 --> 00:52:15,427
- It's- aren't you from Asia?
- No, I'm from Seattle. Light me.

610
00:52:15,511 --> 00:52:18,805
Well, feng shui
is the ancient oreal-

611
00:52:18,931 --> 00:52:22,392
oriental ritual
of decorating your house.

612
00:52:22,518 --> 00:52:26,897
You move all
your furniture so that chi...

613
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:30,776
- Oh, fuck!
- energy can go through the house.

614
00:52:30,859 --> 00:52:32,820
It blows from
one end to the other.

615
00:52:32,861 --> 00:52:35,197
Okay,
we can work with that.

616
00:52:37,115 --> 00:52:39,076
- Ange!
- What?

617
00:52:39,201 --> 00:52:41,036
it's a fucking
sty in here!

618
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:42,454
I know, I'm going...

619
00:52:42,579 --> 00:52:45,123
I'm going
to clean it right now.

620
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:47,417
I was waiting
for everyone to get here.

621
00:52:47,459 --> 00:52:49,461
Where is the kid
going to sleep?

622
00:52:49,586 --> 00:52:52,840
He's going to sleep in here.
I'll sleep on the couch.

623
00:52:52,923 --> 00:52:54,633
This kid is going to sleep
in a heart-shaped bed?

624
00:52:54,716 --> 00:52:59,513
I was thinking I'd turn it upside-down
so it'd look like a spaceship.

625
00:52:59,638 --> 00:53:02,140
Good idea.
And get rid of the sheets.

626
00:53:02,182 --> 00:53:05,686
- Get spaceship sheets.
- Good idea.

627
00:53:05,811 --> 00:53:07,938
Oh my God,
you have to fix this hole.

628
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:08,939
Yeah.

629
00:53:08,981 --> 00:53:10,816
I'll tell Bobby
to fix this hole.

630
00:53:10,899 --> 00:53:12,234
We should make a list.

631
00:53:12,359 --> 00:53:14,236
Okay. Dictate.

632
00:53:15,821 --> 00:53:17,322
Fix the hole.

633
00:53:19,283 --> 00:53:21,243
Um... buy wallpaper.

634
00:53:22,661 --> 00:53:25,998
Bobby will know
where to buy the wallpaper.

635
00:53:26,123 --> 00:53:27,499
Okay...

636
00:53:28,625 --> 00:53:31,461
Fix the air conditioning.
It's so fucking hot in here.

637
00:53:31,545 --> 00:53:33,547
I can't fix
the air conditioning thing

638
00:53:33,672 --> 00:53:35,716
because there are
some rats living in it.

639
00:53:35,841 --> 00:53:38,927
- You can't live with rats!
- I like rats!

640
00:53:39,011 --> 00:53:40,971
We're gonna get rid of them.

641
00:53:41,054 --> 00:53:44,600
Jasmine, don't!
I'm not going to kill them.

642
00:53:44,725 --> 00:53:46,059
You've got
to kill the rats.

643
00:53:46,185 --> 00:53:48,145
Tell Bobby
to kill the rats.

644
00:53:48,312 --> 00:53:50,814
She won't let you keep the kid
if you have rats.

645
00:53:50,898 --> 00:53:51,940
I won't keep the rats.

646
00:53:52,065 --> 00:53:54,860
- I'll put them at your house.
- I am not keeping rats!

647
00:53:54,985 --> 00:53:56,236
Just temporarily.

648
00:53:56,361 --> 00:54:01,033
We can take the unit out
and put it at your house.

649
00:54:01,116 --> 00:54:03,744
The kid needs air conditioning
and he can't live with rats.

650
00:54:03,869 --> 00:54:05,954
She won't let you keep
the kid if you have rats.

651
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:07,956
I'm against killing them.

652
00:54:08,081 --> 00:54:10,626
Sacrifice the fucking rats!

653
00:54:13,837 --> 00:54:15,547
I'm hungry.

654
00:54:16,798 --> 00:54:19,134
Maybe we should work
on the list outside,

655
00:54:19,259 --> 00:54:21,887
- and work on our tans.
- I want pizza. Do you want some?

656
00:54:22,012 --> 00:54:24,598
- Yeah.
- What kind?

657
00:54:24,681 --> 00:54:27,351
Any kind. You can't
take your top off out there

658
00:54:27,476 --> 00:54:30,562
because Mr. Sherman,
that 100-year-old man, always looks.

659
00:54:30,687 --> 00:54:32,689
- Who's that?
- That's my dad.

660
00:54:32,815 --> 00:54:35,192
Your dad is Adam West?

661
00:54:35,317 --> 00:54:38,779
Well, he's who I like
to think of as my dad.

662
00:54:38,862 --> 00:54:40,823
Don't you think
he kind of looks like me?

663
00:54:40,948 --> 00:54:46,328
Look at his jaw and his mouth,
even his nose and everything.

664
00:54:46,411 --> 00:54:47,830
- Look.
- No.

665
00:54:47,955 --> 00:54:52,584
- Look, if I stood this way.
- Hmm-hm. You don't look like him.

666
00:54:53,669 --> 00:54:54,670
Really?

667
00:54:54,795 --> 00:54:56,380
It's okay. You don't have
to look like him.

668
00:54:56,421 --> 00:55:00,259
Let's get pepperoni. Don't tell
the lady your dad is Batman.

669
00:55:00,384 --> 00:55:03,095
Why?

670
00:55:03,262 --> 00:55:05,639
Ellen.
Ellen Taylor.

671
00:55:05,722 --> 00:55:07,599
Okay, have a seat.
We'll call you when we're ready.

672
00:55:07,724 --> 00:55:09,101
Okay.

673
00:55:13,397 --> 00:55:16,733
- Your name is Ellen?
- Yeah.

674
00:55:16,817 --> 00:55:19,486
That's what we want to name
the baby if it's a girl,

675
00:55:19,611 --> 00:55:21,238
after my husband's grandma.

676
00:55:21,363 --> 00:55:24,199
It's kind of old-fashioned,
but it's so pretty.

677
00:55:25,701 --> 00:55:28,745
Excuse me, Ellen.
You can't smoke in here.

678
00:55:28,829 --> 00:55:30,998
- There's no smoking here.
- I'm sorry.

679
00:55:31,081 --> 00:55:32,875
It's a doctor's office.

680
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,127
You should probably
seriously consider

681
00:55:35,252 --> 00:55:37,838
stopping smoking at this point.

682
00:55:37,921 --> 00:55:40,340
- Why?
- It's bad for the baby.

683
00:55:41,592 --> 00:55:43,093
I'm sorry, Ellen.

684
00:55:43,218 --> 00:55:45,429
You might be able
to smoke outside,

685
00:55:45,554 --> 00:55:47,389
but you can't smoke in here.

686
00:55:47,514 --> 00:55:52,895
And it's- like I said-
it's bad for the baby.

687
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:56,440
A girlfriend of mine
went for acupuncture-

688
00:55:56,565 --> 00:55:59,860
I don't give a fuck about
the girlfriend of yours, okay?

689
00:55:59,985 --> 00:56:04,948
Everybody doesn't have a happy,
cheerful, chirpy life like you do.

690
00:56:05,073 --> 00:56:07,326
Okay? Everybody's
not here to have a baby.

691
00:56:07,451 --> 00:56:09,453
Some of us-
Fuck you!

692
00:56:09,536 --> 00:56:13,874
Fuck you, bitch!
Some of us are here to have abortion!

693
00:56:13,957 --> 00:56:16,627
- Did you ever think of that?
- I'm sorry, no.

694
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:19,880
Did you ever?
No, because you don't think.

695
00:56:19,963 --> 00:56:22,716
You rattle on and on
about your happy little husband

696
00:56:22,841 --> 00:56:25,135
and your happy little
grandmother named Ellen

697
00:56:25,219 --> 00:56:27,221
and you don't give
a fuck about other people.

698
00:56:27,262 --> 00:56:29,306
You have a problem, lady!

699
00:56:29,389 --> 00:56:31,850
You think you're the only one
with reproductive organs?

700
00:56:31,975 --> 00:56:34,728
I'm going to have
this fucking baby,

701
00:56:34,853 --> 00:56:38,482
and my baby is going to sell drugs
to your baby on the playground.

702
00:56:38,607 --> 00:56:40,567
You fucking bitch!

703
00:56:42,444 --> 00:56:44,238
Oh my God!

704
00:56:44,321 --> 00:56:47,074
- Ohh!
- What the fuck is that?

705
00:56:47,157 --> 00:56:50,035
- Oh my God!
- What are these for?

706
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,287
Jimmy:
These are for Angel.

707
00:56:55,958 --> 00:56:59,461
- Stacy's Flower Company.
- Who are they from?

708
00:56:59,586 --> 00:57:04,258
The driver said he was not allowed
to tell me who paid for them.

709
00:57:04,341 --> 00:57:07,886
- What are you talking about?
- They're from a funeral parlor.

710
00:57:08,011 --> 00:57:09,972
I'm not dead.

711
00:57:10,055 --> 00:57:12,224
- They look like they're big.
- Oh my God!

712
00:57:12,349 --> 00:57:16,270
- These are so beautiful.
- Nice, Angel. Score.

713
00:57:16,353 --> 00:57:19,690
Oh my God!
Who are they from?

714
00:57:19,773 --> 00:57:22,734
The driver said
he could not tell me.

715
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:24,820
Jasmine:
Did they give a card?

716
00:57:24,945 --> 00:57:27,364
Jimmy:
No. I don't know nothing else.

717
00:57:27,489 --> 00:57:32,035
I bet they're from Dale,
the guy with the bald head.

718
00:57:32,161 --> 00:57:36,373
- The sweet big man, kind of nerdy.
- The guy drives a bus.

719
00:57:36,415 --> 00:57:41,211
Yeah but sometimes those nerdy
guys are from Silicon Valley.

720
00:57:41,336 --> 00:57:43,672
- He's a poor nerd.
- They invent toilet flushers...

721
00:57:43,797 --> 00:57:45,549
- No, he's just poor.
- See you later.

722
00:57:45,674 --> 00:57:49,636
Angel, these are 200
or 300 bucks! It's ugly, but...

723
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:53,432
I have an independently
wealthy secret admirer.

724
00:57:53,557 --> 00:57:54,600
I'm going to take one, okay?

725
00:57:54,725 --> 00:57:56,226
Maybe they're from Charlie.

726
00:57:56,310 --> 00:57:58,770
His record deal
might have come through.

727
00:57:58,896 --> 00:58:02,149
Just kidding.
Just kidding, sweetie.

728
00:58:02,274 --> 00:58:04,026
Oh my God!

729
00:58:04,151 --> 00:58:06,361
- I can't believe it!
- You lucky girl.

730
00:58:06,445 --> 00:58:12,201
I know, it's like-
I'm like, so lucky.

731
00:58:48,570 --> 00:58:50,823
We're gonna kick it
into the next gear,

732
00:58:50,948 --> 00:58:52,616
because coming to the stage

733
00:58:52,908 --> 00:58:58,247
is our resident wild child.
It's Jo!

734
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:23,981
Jo, it's enough!

735
00:59:24,106 --> 00:59:26,984
Dave, get over here.
Get Jo off the stage.

736
00:59:27,109 --> 00:59:29,903
What the fuck is
the matter with you?!

737
00:59:30,028 --> 00:59:31,947
What the fuck is
the matter with you?

738
00:59:33,282 --> 00:59:36,076
Bobby:
Get her off the stage.

739
00:59:46,503 --> 00:59:49,214
Bobby:
Angel, get out on stage!

740
01:00:19,244 --> 01:00:21,038
- Fucking asshole!
- Is this her shit?

741
01:00:21,121 --> 01:00:22,790
Yes.

742
01:00:25,751 --> 01:00:28,796
You get the fuck out!
Get out of here!

743
01:00:28,879 --> 01:00:32,049
You're a big man, aren't you?

744
01:00:32,174 --> 01:00:35,177
You fucking piece of shit!

745
01:00:35,302 --> 01:00:37,596
- You shit!
- Let her go.

746
01:00:37,721 --> 01:00:39,014
Dave, you keep her out of here.

747
01:00:39,139 --> 01:00:40,724
Keep her out of here.

748
01:00:40,808 --> 01:00:43,769
I want my stuff, Jessie.

749
01:00:43,936 --> 01:00:46,980
- Give me my stuff.
- Here's your stuff.

750
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:01,620
Okay, this one's from me.

751
01:01:02,788 --> 01:01:05,916
"Pale shades of gray
loft the clouds

752
01:01:05,999 --> 01:01:08,252
Above the bed,
half filled.

753
01:01:08,377 --> 01:01:10,796
There is no smile
in this room,

754
01:01:10,879 --> 01:01:13,048
No laugh during love.

755
01:01:14,174 --> 01:01:17,136
A pall gently descends
over the space,

756
01:01:17,261 --> 01:01:21,265
Once a sanctum,
now a hollow shape,

757
01:01:21,390 --> 01:01:26,353
As the sun rises,
and my eyes fill with black. "

758
01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:31,275
Thank you. Thank you.
All right.

759
01:01:31,358 --> 01:01:34,319
I have a very special
surprise for us today.

760
01:01:34,444 --> 01:01:36,864
I decided to bring
up a special mystery guest,

761
01:01:36,989 --> 01:01:38,740
and it's someone who's
actually never read before,

762
01:01:38,866 --> 01:01:41,326
so when she comes up,
give her a big encouragement.

763
01:01:41,410 --> 01:01:43,328
Let's hear it for Jasmine.

764
01:01:47,791 --> 01:01:49,543
Jasmine.

765
01:01:49,668 --> 01:01:51,837
Come on up.

766
01:01:51,962 --> 01:01:53,255
You don't want to read?

767
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:56,717
Come on up, give it a try.
Let's give her encouragement.

768
01:02:00,804 --> 01:02:03,432
We've all been there.
Good luck.

769
01:02:06,894 --> 01:02:08,979
My name is Cathy.

770
01:02:20,073 --> 01:02:24,286
"If in the skylight, tawny
afternoon a drift of care

771
01:02:24,411 --> 01:02:27,706
It's only love,
but gone in the way of everything.

772
01:02:27,831 --> 01:02:32,711
If in the morning of your soul,
a brush of tenderly imagined lips,

773
01:02:32,795 --> 01:02:37,257
It's only love,
but gone in the way of everything.

774
01:02:37,382 --> 01:02:42,346
If in the messy cocktail dregs
of a midnight glass, a teardrop falls,

775
01:02:42,471 --> 01:02:47,017
It's only love,
but gone in the way of everything.

776
01:02:47,142 --> 01:02:52,272
If in the singing twilight of the dawn,
you give your heart unwanted,

777
01:02:52,356 --> 01:02:56,401
It's only love,
but gone in the way of everything.

778
01:02:56,527 --> 01:03:00,614
Then what in the hours
of your life is love?

779
01:03:00,739 --> 01:03:02,699
It's here and gone,

780
01:03:04,076 --> 01:03:06,286
and gives its name to everything. "

781
01:03:16,171 --> 01:03:18,924
All right, well...

782
01:03:19,007 --> 01:03:22,136
that's it for today.
So we'll see everybody next time,

783
01:03:22,219 --> 01:03:23,971
and thanks a lot.

784
01:03:28,267 --> 01:03:30,269
I'll see you later, okay?

785
01:03:36,066 --> 01:03:38,819
Why did you call my name?
I didn't ask you to call my name.

786
01:03:38,902 --> 01:03:41,405
I don't even know you.

787
01:03:41,488 --> 01:03:43,574
That poem was really great.

788
01:03:45,242 --> 01:03:46,994
Cathy...

789
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:53,250
that was really great.
I don't know what to say.

790
01:03:53,375 --> 01:03:54,960
Yeah, well, thanks.

791
01:03:55,085 --> 01:03:57,004
Do you have any more?

792
01:04:00,215 --> 01:04:02,384
- Yeah.
- You got to get up and read.

793
01:04:02,468 --> 01:04:05,345
That's all.
You've got to get up and read.

794
01:04:05,471 --> 01:04:07,431
- Why?
- Because you're good.

795
01:04:07,556 --> 01:04:09,683
I hate to disappoint you,
but you're really good.

796
01:04:14,271 --> 01:04:15,898
Who is it?

797
01:04:15,981 --> 01:04:19,109
It's... it's me.

798
01:04:19,193 --> 01:04:21,111
It's you?

799
01:04:21,195 --> 01:04:23,572
Yeah, I was sitting in my apartment.

800
01:04:25,199 --> 01:04:26,700
That's me.

801
01:04:28,660 --> 01:04:32,956
This woman
I used to be with, Maria...

802
01:04:32,998 --> 01:04:34,500
she was beautiful.

803
01:04:34,625 --> 01:04:36,210
She was a painter.

804
01:04:36,335 --> 01:04:39,004
She painted that thing.

805
01:04:39,129 --> 01:04:44,051
She was North African,
she had that pretty heavy accent.

806
01:04:44,134 --> 01:04:47,012
She lived in Paris, New York,
all over the place,

807
01:04:47,095 --> 01:04:49,139
and she had me sit five weeks.

808
01:04:50,432 --> 01:04:52,017
Five weeks to do that thing.

809
01:04:52,142 --> 01:04:54,686
You sit still for five weeks, huh?

810
01:04:54,812 --> 01:04:57,314
You can't sit still for five minutes.

811
01:04:57,397 --> 01:04:58,440
Yeah...

812
01:04:59,566 --> 01:05:01,360
And she would talk to me.

813
01:05:01,443 --> 01:05:03,529
She would talk about...

814
01:05:03,612 --> 01:05:07,866
shapes and colors,

815
01:05:07,991 --> 01:05:13,330
light, shadow,
all that stuff- painter shit,

816
01:05:13,455 --> 01:05:15,415
and then she would use all of that,

817
01:05:15,541 --> 01:05:18,127
and that's what
popped this thing to life.

818
01:05:19,878 --> 01:05:22,464
She could look at your body,

819
01:05:22,548 --> 01:05:25,134
and she would paint you,

820
01:05:25,259 --> 01:05:28,512
but she would bring out
the shit that you never see.

821
01:05:28,595 --> 01:05:29,888
You know what I mean?

822
01:05:31,265 --> 01:05:34,101
She was a wild girl, too.

823
01:05:34,226 --> 01:05:36,395
When she got tired
in the afternoon, she said,

824
01:05:36,436 --> 01:05:39,565
"Eddie, you want to eat?"

825
01:05:44,361 --> 01:05:50,868
I was alone in
this room- in this apartment

826
01:05:50,993 --> 01:05:53,370
that I used to live with in Seattle.

827
01:05:53,495 --> 01:05:57,708
He had a lot of books,
so I would sit and read all day.

828
01:05:57,833 --> 01:06:00,919
One day I just couldn't
stand it any longer,

829
01:06:01,044 --> 01:06:03,505
and I shut the blinds and...

830
01:06:05,424 --> 01:06:07,718
kneeled on the floor and-

831
01:06:07,801 --> 01:06:13,307
bawling my eyes out,
and I wrote it.

832
01:06:13,432 --> 01:06:15,267
I tore it up.

833
01:06:17,311 --> 01:06:19,771
I can't believe you
want to hear this stuff.

834
01:06:19,855 --> 01:06:21,565
Were you stripping then?

835
01:06:23,901 --> 01:06:25,152
Yeah.

836
01:06:26,487 --> 01:06:29,198
I was working up in Seattle.
How do you know I'm a stripper?

837
01:06:29,323 --> 01:06:32,201
This kid who works for me
said he saw you dance.

838
01:06:32,326 --> 01:06:33,744
Tell him I said hi.

839
01:06:33,952 --> 01:06:37,539
In this dream I had last night-
remember that cat

840
01:06:37,623 --> 01:06:39,917
Johnny Washington I got in
a fight with in San Diego?

841
01:06:39,958 --> 01:06:42,294
I don't remember him on purpose.

842
01:06:42,419 --> 01:06:47,049
I saw my knife, my hand
cutting, and cutting his face,

843
01:06:47,174 --> 01:06:50,219
blood getting on everything,
blood all over.

844
01:06:54,723 --> 01:06:57,518
Strange, man.
Then I couldn't wash my hands.

845
01:07:04,733 --> 01:07:06,568
Remember that phone call?

846
01:07:06,693 --> 01:07:09,112
The girl crying I played
for you the other day?

847
01:07:09,196 --> 01:07:10,572
Erase it.

848
01:07:12,407 --> 01:07:14,076
I would have
erased it last week,

849
01:07:14,159 --> 01:07:16,078
I would have said,
fuck the bitch, man...

850
01:07:16,203 --> 01:07:17,746
but...

851
01:07:17,830 --> 01:07:21,416
this week, I can't say,
fuck the bitch, you know?

852
01:07:27,923 --> 01:07:29,550
You got some herb with you?

853
01:07:30,759 --> 01:07:32,010
Yeah.

854
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:36,515
Why don't you roll us a joint?

855
01:07:39,059 --> 01:07:41,520
So, do you go to strip clubs?

856
01:07:41,645 --> 01:07:42,646
No.

857
01:07:42,771 --> 01:07:44,356
Yeah, you don't seem
like the type.

858
01:07:44,481 --> 01:07:46,358
Yeah? What's the type?

859
01:07:46,483 --> 01:07:49,111
You know, married, lonely...

860
01:07:49,236 --> 01:07:51,196
This kid
who works for me, Jorge-

861
01:07:51,363 --> 01:07:53,073
Yeah, he's the kind
of kid that goes.

862
01:07:53,157 --> 01:07:55,742
He said you're
on the billboard.

863
01:07:55,868 --> 01:07:57,786
Yeah,
the Blue Iguana has a couple.

864
01:07:57,870 --> 01:07:59,997
I'm only on one,
since my tits are small.

865
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:02,040
I'll get them done.

866
01:08:02,124 --> 01:08:04,209
So are you the kind
of guy who likes big tits?

867
01:08:04,293 --> 01:08:07,045
Actually, you know what?

868
01:08:07,129 --> 01:08:10,007
I'm not used to
that line of questioning,

869
01:08:10,132 --> 01:08:12,509
to tell you the truth.

870
01:08:12,593 --> 01:08:14,887
All right.

871
01:08:14,970 --> 01:08:17,222
Do you have any other
writers at your club?

872
01:08:17,347 --> 01:08:18,765
Maybe we could
change the whole venue.

873
01:08:18,891 --> 01:08:21,059
I don't know what
you're doing with me.

874
01:08:21,185 --> 01:08:22,060
What?

875
01:08:22,186 --> 01:08:24,563
You should be
with that French girl.

876
01:08:24,646 --> 01:08:26,356
She's a good poet.

877
01:08:32,237 --> 01:08:33,989
I really want to kiss you.

878
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:38,452
- Okay.
- No, I really want to kiss you.

879
01:08:40,162 --> 01:08:42,122
I want to kiss the poet.

880
01:09:02,643 --> 01:09:05,187
Do you have a problem
with me dancing?

881
01:09:05,270 --> 01:09:07,022
No.

882
01:09:17,533 --> 01:09:19,701
Angel.

883
01:09:19,785 --> 01:09:22,037
Yeah?

884
01:09:22,121 --> 01:09:23,956
I have something for you.

885
01:09:26,125 --> 01:09:27,793
Again?

886
01:09:27,876 --> 01:09:31,338
- Oh my God! What is it?
- Open it up.

887
01:09:31,463 --> 01:09:33,048
Wow!

888
01:09:35,968 --> 01:09:39,429
Oh my God!

889
01:09:40,806 --> 01:09:42,641
Look at that!

890
01:09:44,268 --> 01:09:46,228
Oh my God!

891
01:09:46,311 --> 01:09:47,437
Jewels!

892
01:09:47,563 --> 01:09:49,565
Yes, it's jewels.

893
01:09:50,899 --> 01:09:52,276
And look...

894
01:09:53,944 --> 01:09:59,158
Charlie!

895
01:09:59,283 --> 01:10:00,784
Hey, baby!

896
01:10:01,869 --> 01:10:04,163
- Guess what?
- Charlie?!

897
01:10:04,246 --> 01:10:05,998
They don't want me.

898
01:10:06,123 --> 01:10:08,292
You want to know why?

899
01:10:08,375 --> 01:10:10,919
'Cause I fucking hang
out with skanks like you!

900
01:10:11,044 --> 01:10:12,463
Charlie!

901
01:10:13,672 --> 01:10:15,048
Aren't you pretty?

902
01:10:15,132 --> 01:10:17,843
Aren't you fucking pretty?
Just to fuck morals!

903
01:10:17,968 --> 01:10:19,470
- Come here!
- I'm sorry.

904
01:10:19,595 --> 01:10:21,597
I'm sorry, Charlie.

905
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:26,810
I met someone.

906
01:10:29,980 --> 01:10:31,482
Okay...
what's his name?

907
01:10:31,607 --> 01:10:34,276
- Dennis.
- Dennis, and?

908
01:10:34,359 --> 01:10:35,944
And?

909
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:42,367
And I think- I don't know.

910
01:10:44,787 --> 01:10:46,246
He's a poet.

911
01:10:47,831 --> 01:10:50,626
He runs that thing
at the Coffee Ground, and...

912
01:10:50,709 --> 01:10:52,711
he likes my poetry, so...

913
01:10:52,795 --> 01:10:54,797
So you're gonna go
to San Francisco with Dennis?

914
01:10:54,922 --> 01:10:58,509
Yeah, he invited me up there.
There's this big slam and...

915
01:11:01,345 --> 01:11:03,889
And you're going
to support him stripping?

916
01:11:04,014 --> 01:11:07,726
No. I don't know. No.

917
01:11:14,024 --> 01:11:17,986
I thought we'd just
kind of write together-

918
01:11:21,156 --> 01:11:22,991
Does he know what you do?

919
01:11:23,117 --> 01:11:26,078
Yeah, and he's fine with it.

920
01:11:27,454 --> 01:11:31,250
Yeah, he really fucking
loves my poetry,

921
01:11:31,333 --> 01:11:33,627
so he thinks that I can,
you know...

922
01:11:35,462 --> 01:11:37,673
get published or something.

923
01:11:43,846 --> 01:11:45,180
Does he love you?

924
01:11:47,391 --> 01:11:50,227
I don't know, I just met him
three days ago.

925
01:11:54,106 --> 01:11:55,899
That's really
a smart thing to do then.

926
01:11:56,024 --> 01:11:59,111
I think you should go to
San Francisco with Dennis the poet

927
01:11:59,236 --> 01:12:04,908
whom you met three days ago
and write poetry and support him.

928
01:12:10,414 --> 01:12:12,791
I need some more
fucking cigarettes.

929
01:12:15,794 --> 01:12:18,755
- Bad! You are bad! Very bad!
- Very, very bad!

930
01:12:23,135 --> 01:12:27,431
- I've had a bad week-
- I don't care about your week.

931
01:12:27,514 --> 01:12:29,808
I don't care about your week.
Are you hungry?

932
01:12:29,892 --> 01:12:32,060
- Yes, Mistress, starving.
- All right...

933
01:12:32,186 --> 01:12:34,688
- there you go, eat!
- Thank you, Mistress.

934
01:12:34,813 --> 01:12:36,398
All right, enough of this shit.

935
01:12:36,523 --> 01:12:39,234
It's time to take
the little wormy for a walk.

936
01:12:39,318 --> 01:12:42,196
Get down on the ground.

937
01:12:42,321 --> 01:12:45,407
Get down on the ground
and crawl. Crawl!

938
01:12:45,532 --> 01:12:49,953
Crawl like the sub-human
creature that you are-

939
01:12:50,037 --> 01:12:52,164
Who the fuck is that?

940
01:12:52,289 --> 01:12:54,458
All right, you stay right here.

941
01:12:59,296 --> 01:13:00,923
Jessie, what are you doing here?

942
01:13:01,048 --> 01:13:02,007
Hi, I just-

943
01:13:02,132 --> 01:13:04,301
It's 3:00 a. m.
What the fuck are you doing?

944
01:13:04,426 --> 01:13:06,678
I thought you needed
company tonight.

945
01:13:06,762 --> 01:13:08,972
Well, you thought wrong.
I have company.

946
01:13:09,097 --> 01:13:10,307
- Goodbye.
- Who is that?

947
01:13:10,432 --> 01:13:13,685
Jessie, I'm in the middle
of something, can't you tell?

948
01:13:13,769 --> 01:13:15,771
I have a life. Can you go?

949
01:13:15,896 --> 01:13:19,149
Angel said you might need company
on account of the baby.

950
01:13:19,274 --> 01:13:20,609
Angel thought wrong.

951
01:13:20,734 --> 01:13:23,737
Company is the last thing I need.
You got to go.

952
01:13:24,822 --> 01:13:26,615
- Hi!
- Hi!

953
01:13:26,740 --> 01:13:29,618
Don't talk to him.
He's being punished, okay?

954
01:13:29,743 --> 01:13:32,996
Anyway, he doesn't exist,
he's just a pathetic worm.

955
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:36,041
Get down on the floor!
Did I tell you to sit up?

956
01:13:36,166 --> 01:13:37,417
Get down on the floor!

957
01:13:37,501 --> 01:13:39,837
I don't want
any conversation from you!

958
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:41,213
Jessie, get up.

959
01:13:41,296 --> 01:13:44,466
- You have been a bad boy!
- I have, Mistress.

960
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:47,553
All right. Stop!

961
01:13:47,636 --> 01:13:49,346
You don't talk to her.

962
01:13:49,471 --> 01:13:50,931
Don't talk to her, okay?

963
01:13:51,056 --> 01:13:52,683
Can't you see we're
in the middle of something?

964
01:13:52,766 --> 01:13:53,934
Come here, sit down.

965
01:13:54,017 --> 01:13:56,770
- I want to play.
- I'm not playing.

966
01:13:56,895 --> 01:14:00,440
This is business. Do you
think I'd have fun with this?

967
01:14:00,566 --> 01:14:04,153
- This is a client.
- Do you mind if I stay?

968
01:14:04,236 --> 01:14:07,322
- I wouldn't-
- Don't talk. Shut up!

969
01:14:07,448 --> 01:14:09,658
Get down on the ground.

970
01:14:09,783 --> 01:14:12,369
Are you hungry, worm?
Are you thirsty?

971
01:14:12,494 --> 01:14:14,621
Drink! Drink the fucking vodka!

972
01:14:14,746 --> 01:14:18,292
Keep your head-
Jessie! Don't drink that.

973
01:14:18,375 --> 01:14:21,462
That's disgusting.
It's dirty.

974
01:14:21,545 --> 01:14:23,338
May I have two mistresses?

975
01:14:23,422 --> 01:14:25,799
No, you are not
having two mistresses.

976
01:14:25,924 --> 01:14:28,051
Jessie, you have
to get out of here.

977
01:14:28,177 --> 01:14:33,015
No, Jo. Let me stay.
I have nowhere to go.

978
01:14:33,098 --> 01:14:36,059
Let's not get all melodramatic.

979
01:14:36,185 --> 01:14:38,312
All right. Come here.
Get up. Stand up.

980
01:14:38,437 --> 01:14:40,189
What are you looking at?

981
01:14:40,272 --> 01:14:41,440
Do you mind
if I stay tonight?

982
01:14:41,565 --> 01:14:43,525
- No.
- He doesn't mind.

983
01:14:43,650 --> 01:14:45,861
Jo:
Your opinion doesn't count.

984
01:14:45,944 --> 01:14:47,488
Jessie...

985
01:14:47,613 --> 01:14:49,573
what happened to you?

986
01:14:49,656 --> 01:14:52,075
What the fuck is this?
Who did that?

987
01:14:52,159 --> 01:14:53,368
Did Charlie hit you?

988
01:14:53,494 --> 01:14:56,205
No, I just want
to have a slumber party.

989
01:14:56,330 --> 01:14:58,290
Man:
You should put ice on it.

990
01:14:58,415 --> 01:15:00,125
Jo:
Can you stay out of this?

991
01:15:00,250 --> 01:15:01,502
Jessie:
Let's have a slumber party.

992
01:15:01,585 --> 01:15:04,338
Jessie, get up.
You don't know where he's been.

993
01:15:04,421 --> 01:15:07,174
Come on, sweetheart.
Lie down and sleep it off.

994
01:15:07,299 --> 01:15:09,343
This isn't a place for kids.

995
01:15:09,468 --> 01:15:11,428
I don't want to.
I want to play.

996
01:15:11,553 --> 01:15:14,139
All right, you win.
Stay here,

997
01:15:14,264 --> 01:15:17,476
but no more than one night,
'cause I have a life.

998
01:15:17,601 --> 01:15:20,896
- But I want to play.
- No. You lie here.

999
01:15:21,021 --> 01:15:23,273
Be very quiet, and sleep it off.

1000
01:15:23,357 --> 01:15:27,861
And don't bother me while I'm doing
business with the nice man.

1001
01:15:27,945 --> 01:15:29,404
Just when you get back...

1002
01:16:32,926 --> 01:16:36,263
Officer.

1003
01:16:36,388 --> 01:16:39,516
Officer,
could you help me with-

1004
01:16:39,641 --> 01:16:41,977
could you help me
take a picture of my-

1005
01:16:42,060 --> 01:16:44,897
I want to take a picture
of myself in front of it.

1006
01:16:45,022 --> 01:16:46,440
- Is that you?
- Yeah.

1007
01:16:46,607 --> 01:16:48,150
Really?

1008
01:16:48,233 --> 01:16:51,028
I'm a lot smaller in person.

1009
01:16:52,112 --> 01:16:54,907
But, um...

1010
01:16:55,032 --> 01:16:58,786
See, I think I'm only getting my hat.

1011
01:17:02,956 --> 01:17:05,542
You realize you're not
supposed to be down here?

1012
01:17:05,667 --> 01:17:06,919
Um...

1013
01:17:07,044 --> 01:17:09,421
sorry, I'll leave as soon as I-

1014
01:17:09,546 --> 01:17:12,132
I just wanted to get
a good shot of my picture.

1015
01:17:12,216 --> 01:17:15,344
- All right.
- Thanks.

1016
01:17:15,427 --> 01:17:18,764
- Is it ready to go?
- Yeah. There.

1017
01:17:20,140 --> 01:17:22,851
A little wider.
Can you take it a little wider?

1018
01:17:22,976 --> 01:17:24,603
- You mean back?
- Yeah.

1019
01:17:24,728 --> 01:17:26,230
How is that?

1020
01:17:26,396 --> 01:17:28,023
I got it all.

1021
01:17:28,106 --> 01:17:29,650
Ready? Cheese.

1022
01:17:29,775 --> 01:17:32,152
- Cheese.
- Cheese.

1023
01:17:32,236 --> 01:17:34,196
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1024
01:17:34,279 --> 01:17:37,491
Did anyone ever tell you
you look like Fred Gwynne?

1025
01:17:37,616 --> 01:17:39,785
You know, the guy
who was Herman Munster?

1026
01:17:39,910 --> 01:17:42,246
No one has ever told me that.

1027
01:17:42,371 --> 01:17:45,332
I really like him.
He's the great-

1028
01:17:46,583 --> 01:17:47,626
Shit!

1029
01:17:47,751 --> 01:17:52,798
I locked my keys in my car
and I have to be at work!

1030
01:17:52,923 --> 01:17:54,133
Oh no!

1031
01:17:54,216 --> 01:17:56,635
Damn it!
You have a hanger?

1032
01:17:56,718 --> 01:17:59,221
This side's open.

1033
01:17:59,346 --> 01:18:01,557
Would you unlock this door for me?

1034
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:03,225
- Sure.
- Thanks.

1035
01:18:05,727 --> 01:18:09,439
This is the lock.

1036
01:18:10,732 --> 01:18:12,484
Ma'am, is this marijuana?

1037
01:18:15,696 --> 01:18:19,658
I think it's uh-
it's an herbal cigarette.

1038
01:18:19,783 --> 01:18:22,119
Step around to the side
of the car, please.

1039
01:18:23,245 --> 01:18:25,247
I- I did not inhale. I-

1040
01:18:26,832 --> 01:18:29,084
Step around at the side of the car.
It will take a minute.

1041
01:18:29,209 --> 01:18:31,670
Well, it's probably just oregano.

1042
01:18:31,795 --> 01:18:35,007
You should have it examined
'cause I don't feel stoned.

1043
01:18:35,090 --> 01:18:38,802
I'll have it examined.
It'll take a second.

1044
01:18:38,886 --> 01:18:42,556
- It won't be long.
- Do you have to handcuff me?

1045
01:18:42,639 --> 01:18:44,892
I'm afraid I do.
This will take a minute.

1046
01:18:44,975 --> 01:18:48,228
You can find me
at the Blue Iguana every day.

1047
01:18:48,353 --> 01:18:50,022
I'm really a good person,

1048
01:18:50,147 --> 01:18:54,193
- and I have respons-
- Just stand still for a few minutes.

1049
01:18:54,276 --> 01:18:56,987
I'll take a look at the car
for your license and registration.

1050
01:18:57,070 --> 01:19:01,033
Okay,
but I have responsibilities,

1051
01:19:01,116 --> 01:19:04,286
and children I might
need to be a role model for,

1052
01:19:04,411 --> 01:19:06,497
and if I get a record,
it will be really bad.

1053
01:19:06,622 --> 01:19:08,540
I understand.
Is this your purse?

1054
01:19:08,665 --> 01:19:10,667
Yeah, that fuzzy- the pink.

1055
01:19:12,294 --> 01:19:14,087
- This?
- Yeah.

1056
01:19:16,381 --> 01:19:18,842
Officer,
is there any way you could-

1057
01:19:18,967 --> 01:19:23,764
I'm gonna pay that.
I got an extension, and I-

1058
01:19:23,889 --> 01:19:25,098
- Which one is your wallet?

1059
01:19:25,182 --> 01:19:28,560
It's the one that
say Bad Motherfucker on it.

1060
01:19:28,685 --> 01:19:30,646
Did you ever see Pulp Fiction?

1061
01:19:30,771 --> 01:19:32,439
No, I never saw it.

1062
01:19:32,564 --> 01:19:35,901
John Travolta's career
came back after-

1063
01:19:36,026 --> 01:19:39,613
I was sick when
they took that picture.

1064
01:19:44,535 --> 01:19:48,664
- A lot of bills, ma'am.
- Yeah, they're all ones.

1065
01:19:48,747 --> 01:19:50,499
You can have some.

1066
01:19:53,710 --> 01:19:55,129
- What are these?

1067
01:19:55,212 --> 01:19:58,757
They are my friend Jo's
vitamins for her pregnancy.

1068
01:19:58,882 --> 01:20:00,717
I think.

1069
01:20:04,930 --> 01:20:07,224
Is there any way that-
Officer-

1070
01:20:07,349 --> 01:20:09,518
that maybe you could
forget about this?

1071
01:20:09,643 --> 01:20:12,396
Because I'm really
a good person.

1072
01:20:12,437 --> 01:20:15,274
You can come down
to the Blue Iguana.

1073
01:20:15,357 --> 01:20:19,611
They let LAPD all the time for free,
'cause we're a clean club.

1074
01:20:19,695 --> 01:20:22,072
- Is that right?
- Eddie gets mad.

1075
01:20:22,156 --> 01:20:24,908
Our managers sometimes
can't get them out of the club

1076
01:20:24,992 --> 01:20:26,452
because they like it so much.

1077
01:20:26,535 --> 01:20:30,205
My friend Jo works
with a lot of LAPD guys.

1078
01:20:30,330 --> 01:20:32,916
- She's really beautiful-
- I'm going to ask-

1079
01:20:32,958 --> 01:20:38,088
- She'd really like you.
- I'm happy to hear that.

1080
01:20:38,213 --> 01:20:40,549
Stay by the car
for a couple of minutes

1081
01:20:40,632 --> 01:20:42,926
while I go run the license
and registration, all right?

1082
01:20:43,010 --> 01:20:46,096
- Okay. Is that necessary?
- It is. I'll be back.

1083
01:20:46,221 --> 01:20:49,099
Officer, is this
going to be on the news-

1084
01:20:49,224 --> 01:20:51,477
No, no.
It's gonna be okay.

1085
01:20:51,518 --> 01:20:54,313
I really can't- I don't-

1086
01:20:54,396 --> 01:20:59,359
I always wanted to be in the Enquirer
but not for getting arrested.

1087
01:20:59,485 --> 01:21:04,239
I thought maybe if I had
a handsome hunk or a nice dress...

1088
01:21:04,364 --> 01:21:05,824
Is there- is-

1089
01:21:07,201 --> 01:21:08,160
- Shit!
- It won't take a minute.

1090
01:21:08,285 --> 01:21:09,745
Okay.

1091
01:21:10,829 --> 01:21:11,914
Shit!

1092
01:21:23,842 --> 01:21:26,929
- Hi, Eddie.
- Where's Jasmine?

1093
01:21:27,054 --> 01:21:29,306
She wasn't feeling too well.

1094
01:21:31,558 --> 01:21:34,394
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1095
01:22:11,014 --> 01:22:13,350
- Oh fuck!
- What's the matter?

1096
01:22:13,475 --> 01:22:14,685
Fuck! Fuck!

1097
01:22:14,768 --> 01:22:17,020
- You have to go to work?
- No. No.

1098
01:22:17,104 --> 01:22:18,564
You want me to call your boss?

1099
01:22:18,689 --> 01:22:20,524
- I'll call him.
- No! Fuck off. No!

1100
01:22:20,607 --> 01:22:22,776
- Don't call him.
- Fuck off. What's his name?

1101
01:22:22,860 --> 01:22:23,944
Nothing.

1102
01:22:24,069 --> 01:22:26,363
Okay, I'd like to talk
to Mr. Nothing, please?

1103
01:22:26,447 --> 01:22:28,073
- No!
- Okay.

1104
01:22:28,157 --> 01:22:30,451
Don't.
I want to stay here.

1105
01:22:30,576 --> 01:22:32,035
Okay. All right.

1106
01:22:33,996 --> 01:22:35,664
But I want to smoke.

1107
01:22:36,748 --> 01:22:38,250
You have a great ass.

1108
01:22:38,375 --> 01:22:39,334
You can hit it.

1109
01:22:39,501 --> 01:22:41,336
I don't want to hit it.
I want to kiss it.

1110
01:22:41,420 --> 01:22:42,963
You want to kiss my ass?

1111
01:22:49,136 --> 01:22:50,929
Thank you.

1112
01:23:28,759 --> 01:23:30,093
Hi, Eddie.

1113
01:23:30,177 --> 01:23:31,470
Sorry I'm late.

1114
01:23:31,595 --> 01:23:33,180
Better make it good, girl.

1115
01:23:33,305 --> 01:23:35,265
I have very bad cramps.

1116
01:23:35,390 --> 01:23:37,726
- Yeah, really bad cramps.
- I'm here.

1117
01:23:37,851 --> 01:23:41,188
That's a prize winner.
You're here late, God damn it!

1118
01:23:41,313 --> 01:23:43,649
Where the fuck were you?
You couldn't call?

1119
01:23:45,025 --> 01:23:46,944
I need VIP night off.

1120
01:23:48,654 --> 01:23:50,322
Goddamn, you're priceless.

1121
01:23:50,447 --> 01:23:54,159
Eddie, I can't work anyway.
My cramps are so bad.

1122
01:23:54,284 --> 01:23:56,578
Your cramps are killing you!
How long have you worked here?

1123
01:23:56,703 --> 01:23:58,914
You've worked here a year, right?

1124
01:23:58,997 --> 01:24:01,125
When was the last
time you got off for cramps?

1125
01:24:01,208 --> 01:24:02,626
- Never!
- What's your problem?

1126
01:24:02,751 --> 01:24:06,171
What's my problem? I don't want
you to tell me a goddamn lie!

1127
01:24:06,296 --> 01:24:10,551
- Jo and Angel have-
- This ain't about Jo and Angel!

1128
01:24:10,676 --> 01:24:12,636
I run this motherfucker.

1129
01:24:12,678 --> 01:24:15,931
I'm asking you what
the goddamn deal really is.

1130
01:24:16,056 --> 01:24:19,309
So don't tell me
about no fucking period!

1131
01:24:19,393 --> 01:24:21,770
I can't. I can't. I can't.

1132
01:24:21,895 --> 01:24:24,440
I'll come back on Monday.
I'll work the rest of the week.

1133
01:24:24,565 --> 01:24:27,693
- I need the weekend off.
- Tomorrow night, you're dancing.

1134
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:30,946
You're one of my star girls.
I need you.

1135
01:24:31,029 --> 01:24:33,365
You come in late and
ask for tomorrow off?

1136
01:24:33,449 --> 01:24:36,160
- What's the big deal?
- I need to know!

1137
01:24:36,201 --> 01:24:37,453
What?

1138
01:24:38,328 --> 01:24:39,746
The truth.

1139
01:24:41,165 --> 01:24:43,000
The goddamn truth.

1140
01:24:44,126 --> 01:24:45,794
Don't fuck with me, Jasmine.

1141
01:24:45,878 --> 01:24:47,254
You tell me what's up.

1142
01:24:49,256 --> 01:24:51,675
I can't. I can't.

1143
01:24:53,135 --> 01:24:56,263
What the fuck do you
care about anyway?

1144
01:24:56,388 --> 01:24:58,348
You don't care about
anyone else in here!

1145
01:24:58,474 --> 01:25:00,601
I care because I care,
God damn it!

1146
01:25:00,726 --> 01:25:03,562
Don't treat me like trash!

1147
01:25:03,687 --> 01:25:06,690
I'm not- I have a life
and I need the weekend off.

1148
01:25:06,815 --> 01:25:09,693
You ain't got no life!
This is your life!

1149
01:25:11,195 --> 01:25:12,571
You got that?

1150
01:25:13,655 --> 01:25:15,574
You ain't got no friends.

1151
01:25:15,657 --> 01:25:17,493
Two minutes after
you walk out of here,

1152
01:25:17,618 --> 01:25:18,952
one of your
double-crossing friends

1153
01:25:19,036 --> 01:25:21,413
will come in here
and snitch on your ass!

1154
01:25:22,915 --> 01:25:24,458
- Don't fuck with me.
- I fucking quit!

1155
01:25:24,541 --> 01:25:27,085
- God damn you!
- Sorry.

1156
01:25:27,169 --> 01:25:31,507
- Don't fuck my shit up!
- You have your life. I have mine.

1157
01:25:31,590 --> 01:25:33,383
You ain't got a life!

1158
01:26:02,788 --> 01:26:04,081
Miss Willow?

1159
01:26:05,165 --> 01:26:06,416
It's Sarah.

1160
01:26:12,756 --> 01:26:14,299
- Miss Willow?

1161
01:26:19,513 --> 01:26:21,056
Becky?

1162
01:26:22,474 --> 01:26:24,059
Hello?

1163
01:26:32,568 --> 01:26:35,404
- Hey, it's me.
Okay, let's see...

1164
01:26:35,529 --> 01:26:38,615
I've taken care of the registration.
We're both signed up.

1165
01:26:38,740 --> 01:26:40,868
I got our names signed up.

1166
01:26:40,993 --> 01:26:43,162
So, I put your name
up there for the open read.

1167
01:26:43,287 --> 01:26:44,997
Don't be scared,
there's a lot of people,

1168
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:46,999
but there's strength in numbers.

1169
01:26:47,124 --> 01:26:48,625
It will be really good.

1170
01:26:48,709 --> 01:26:51,170
Call me back so I know

1171
01:26:51,253 --> 01:26:54,381
what time to get
together with you. Bye.

1172
01:26:56,467 --> 01:26:59,094
- Jimmy, what's your favorite?
- And God Spoke.

1173
01:26:59,219 --> 01:27:01,847
- Is that a fuck movie?
- This place looks a little different.

1174
01:27:01,930 --> 01:27:03,891
Hey, Eddie, what it is?

1175
01:27:06,101 --> 01:27:09,021
Go to my car and get
the box I left in there.

1176
01:27:09,146 --> 01:27:11,231
- No problem.
- Bobby...

1177
01:27:11,356 --> 01:27:12,316
What?

1178
01:27:12,441 --> 01:27:14,193
Start things up with this.

1179
01:27:17,571 --> 01:27:18,947
Call Jo.

1180
01:27:20,032 --> 01:27:21,658
I'm not calling her.

1181
01:27:21,784 --> 01:27:23,285
You want to call her?
Call her.

1182
01:27:23,410 --> 01:27:25,204
All right, I'll call her.

1183
01:27:25,329 --> 01:27:27,331
You're bringing her back to work?

1184
01:27:27,456 --> 01:27:29,416
We need everybody.

1185
01:27:29,541 --> 01:27:31,293
You got to rent
Behind the Green Door,

1186
01:27:31,418 --> 01:27:33,253
'cause the trapeze scene is hot.

1187
01:27:35,756 --> 01:27:39,092
Bobby, did you see
the glasses on my desk?

1188
01:27:39,176 --> 01:27:41,637
I saw them sitting there last night.

1189
01:27:43,555 --> 01:27:46,391
- They ain't here.
- I don't have them.

1190
01:27:46,517 --> 01:27:49,853
The motherfucking broads!

1191
01:27:49,978 --> 01:27:52,606
Maybe the girls borrowed
them for the opera.

1192
01:29:28,786 --> 01:29:30,788
Hey, how are you?

1193
01:29:39,797 --> 01:29:41,423
Hey, Eddie!

1194
01:29:43,467 --> 01:29:46,011
- This is Nico.
- Let me help you.

1195
01:29:46,094 --> 01:29:47,721
Let me get you a place here.

1196
01:29:47,846 --> 01:29:50,474
- That's Angel's seat.
- It used to be.

1197
01:29:50,516 --> 01:29:55,395
- That's Angel's stuff.
- Let me know if you need anything.

1198
01:30:02,611 --> 01:30:04,196
Excuse me?

1199
01:30:04,321 --> 01:30:06,990
- That's Angel's seat.
- Eddie gave it to me.

1200
01:30:07,074 --> 01:30:09,409
Hello, porn star?

1201
01:30:09,535 --> 01:30:12,871
- This is Angel's seat.
- Mind your own business.

1202
01:30:12,996 --> 01:30:15,124
Don't start with me again.

1203
01:30:15,249 --> 01:30:17,417
Will I have to haul you back to work?

1204
01:30:17,501 --> 01:30:19,336
- Get your ass out on the floor!
- Fuck you!

1205
01:30:19,461 --> 01:30:22,089
You should take care of this.
Everybody takes advantage of Angel.

1206
01:30:23,841 --> 01:30:26,176
Oh, that's so sweet.

1207
01:30:28,137 --> 01:30:31,765
- $15, please.
- I'd like to see Jasmine.

1208
01:30:31,890 --> 01:30:34,309
- What?
- I'd like to see Jasmine.

1209
01:30:34,393 --> 01:30:36,520
Is it important?
We're busy tonight.

1210
01:30:36,645 --> 01:30:40,399
- Yeah. I'm a friend of hers.
- Hold on a second.

1211
01:30:51,618 --> 01:30:55,581
Hey, Jasmine.
You got a Dennis out front.

1212
01:30:55,706 --> 01:30:56,874
You want me to toss him?

1213
01:30:59,293 --> 01:31:01,086
No, I'm on next, aren't I?

1214
01:31:01,211 --> 01:31:04,173
Give him a good seat.
He can watch me.

1215
01:31:04,298 --> 01:31:06,884
I'll throw
the little boy to the lions.

1216
01:31:12,097 --> 01:31:14,349
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's keep going.

1217
01:31:14,433 --> 01:31:17,436
Please welcome
to the stage, Jasmine!

1218
01:34:04,394 --> 01:34:07,606
Something I can do for you tonight?

1219
01:34:07,689 --> 01:34:10,025
How much for a blow?

1220
01:34:10,109 --> 01:34:12,152
100 bucks.

1221
01:34:14,113 --> 01:34:16,073
Yeah, I can handle that.

1222
01:34:19,827 --> 01:34:22,621
Look at me.
Look at my eyes.

1223
01:34:23,914 --> 01:34:25,749
Yeah.

1224
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:37,386
- Hey.
- Hi.

1225
01:34:57,364 --> 01:34:59,032
Do you want to sit down?

1226
01:35:00,284 --> 01:35:01,869
Sure.

1227
01:35:47,080 --> 01:35:49,208
I'm so sorry.

1228
01:35:50,417 --> 01:35:53,337
No, there's nothing
to be sorry about.

1229
01:35:53,462 --> 01:35:55,088
No.

1230
01:35:57,633 --> 01:36:00,511
There's nothing
to be sorry about.

1231
01:36:13,315 --> 01:36:15,901
I'm looking at this room
with you in it...

1232
01:36:33,752 --> 01:36:37,631
I feel safe.
I feel safe now.

1233
01:37:00,863 --> 01:37:02,698
Make love to me.

1234
01:37:02,823 --> 01:37:08,036
- I can't. I can't.
- Okay.

1235
01:37:15,794 --> 01:37:18,797
- I'm getting married-
- Shh...

1236
01:37:35,355 --> 01:37:37,274
Nico!

1237
01:38:54,643 --> 01:38:58,021
Yes, is Harry Goldberg in?

1238
01:38:58,105 --> 01:39:00,357
Yes, Ed Hazel.

1239
01:39:00,482 --> 01:39:02,234
I'm a friend.

1240
01:39:05,112 --> 01:39:06,738
Has he gone away?

1241
01:39:06,864 --> 01:39:08,824
No.

1242
01:39:13,412 --> 01:39:14,538
Yeah.

1243
01:39:17,082 --> 01:39:18,876
Yeah, thanks a lot.

1244
01:39:25,132 --> 01:39:28,469
Ladies and gentlemen,
the fabulous Nico,

1245
01:39:28,594 --> 01:39:31,763
the one and only.

1246
01:39:37,936 --> 01:39:42,357
Ladies and gentlemen,
the heavenly Angel!

1247
01:39:42,441 --> 01:39:46,069
Are you Angel?

1248
01:39:46,153 --> 01:39:48,280
I think you're up.

1249
01:39:58,707 --> 01:40:01,126
Okay, never mind.

1250
01:41:00,144 --> 01:41:02,771
Hey, fellows,
how is it going?

1251
01:41:02,896 --> 01:41:05,524
Excuse my breasts, I'm lactating.

1252
01:41:08,986 --> 01:41:11,613
I can't get too excited,
'cause then my rubber rolls up.

1253
01:42:25,771 --> 01:42:27,314
Dave!

1254
01:42:27,439 --> 01:42:31,568
Don't move.
It's you, isn't it?

1255
01:42:31,693 --> 01:42:34,988
Dave!
Don't move.

1256
01:42:35,114 --> 01:42:37,658
Dave, can you help me
with my money?

1257
01:42:37,783 --> 01:42:40,035
Please, could you
pick it up? Don't move!

1258
01:42:40,119 --> 01:42:41,161
That Angel, everybody.

1259
01:42:41,286 --> 01:42:43,247
Show her your love.

1260
01:42:43,372 --> 01:42:46,458
It's the one- the flowers-

1261
01:42:47,835 --> 01:42:53,132
Jasmine, it's the guy-
the flower guy is out there.

1262
01:42:53,215 --> 01:42:56,051
Oh my God,
he's the most dreamy thing.

1263
01:42:56,176 --> 01:42:58,720
You know, the guy with the red dress?

1264
01:43:00,264 --> 01:43:02,891
Do you have anything
to straighten me out?

1265
01:43:06,437 --> 01:43:07,896
Fuck!

1266
01:46:24,092 --> 01:46:27,262
What? What?
Wait a minute.

1267
01:46:27,387 --> 01:46:29,181
What are you going away for?

1268
01:46:29,306 --> 01:46:31,475
Wait a minute!

1269
01:47:04,299 --> 01:47:05,926
Oh my God!

1270
01:47:08,095 --> 01:47:10,305
Oh my God!

1271
01:47:16,270 --> 01:47:18,564
Oh my God.

1272
01:47:20,149 --> 01:47:21,984
Oh my God!

1273
01:47:23,110 --> 01:47:25,070
Oh my God!

1274
01:47:45,632 --> 01:47:47,551
Jessie?

1275
01:47:47,634 --> 01:47:48,719
Yeah?

1276
01:47:50,220 --> 01:47:52,347
I can't sleep.

1277
01:47:52,431 --> 01:47:54,057
Are you okay?

1278
01:47:57,561 --> 01:47:59,813
Jo:
Do you want to come join me?

1279
01:48:01,774 --> 01:48:03,734
Sure.

1280
01:48:27,549 --> 01:48:29,718
Sing something.

1281
01:49:35,033 --> 01:49:36,702
Do you have a light?

1282
01:49:39,204 --> 01:49:40,873
Yeah.

1283
01:49:46,712 --> 01:49:48,213
Thank you.

1284
01:49:48,380 --> 01:49:50,299
You can go home now.

1285
01:49:53,177 --> 01:49:56,054
- Can I?
- Yeah.

1286
01:50:00,976 --> 01:50:03,645
What time is it?

1287
01:50:03,771 --> 01:50:05,564
I don't know.
3:30?

1288
01:50:08,776 --> 01:50:11,403
Why are you still here?

1289
01:50:11,528 --> 01:50:15,199
- Why are you still here?
- Good fucking question.

1290
01:50:19,036 --> 01:50:20,496
Who knows?

1291
01:50:20,662 --> 01:50:23,123
I guess I fell asleep.

1292
01:50:23,290 --> 01:50:24,750
Is that what happened?

1293
01:50:24,917 --> 01:50:27,336
Yeah, you were
asleep for a long time.

1294
01:50:27,503 --> 01:50:29,087
Could be worse.

1295
01:50:33,550 --> 01:50:35,969
You have pretty hair.

1296
01:50:36,136 --> 01:50:38,097
Thanks.

1297
01:50:40,599 --> 01:50:43,477
I'm sorry, I forgot your name.

1298
01:50:46,063 --> 01:50:48,232
So do I.

1299
01:50:49,566 --> 01:50:51,276
It's...

1300
01:50:51,401 --> 01:50:53,237
Nico.

1301
01:50:53,278 --> 01:50:56,156
- Nico.
- Yeah.

1302
01:50:58,492 --> 01:51:00,410
What are you writing?

1303
01:51:00,536 --> 01:51:01,745
What?

1304
01:51:08,585 --> 01:51:10,879
I'm just trying to keep you here.

1305
01:51:13,173 --> 01:51:15,384
I hate this part.

1306
01:51:15,509 --> 01:51:18,512
- Going home?
- No.

1307
01:51:19,638 --> 01:51:22,599
It's an awkward fucking
transition, you know?

1308
01:51:26,186 --> 01:51:32,651
It's like- it's just three
more hours till sunset- sunrise.

1309
01:51:39,199 --> 01:51:41,201
Where's your next gig?

1310
01:51:41,368 --> 01:51:43,620
You travel around a lot, right?

1311
01:51:43,745 --> 01:51:45,956
Yeah.

1312
01:51:47,082 --> 01:51:49,126
So where do you live?

1313
01:51:50,210 --> 01:51:53,422
At a hotel.
Hotels.

1314
01:51:53,547 --> 01:51:56,633
Where do you live?

1315
01:51:56,717 --> 01:51:59,094
I lost my house.

1316
01:52:01,096 --> 01:52:02,848
No big deal.

1317
01:52:13,525 --> 01:52:15,569
What are you writing?

1318
01:52:15,736 --> 01:52:17,321
What?

1319
01:52:18,655 --> 01:52:21,283
You write, right?

1320
01:52:21,408 --> 01:52:24,286
That's what you do.
You write.

1321
01:52:24,411 --> 01:52:26,538
You're a writer.

1322
01:52:26,663 --> 01:52:28,916
It's so fucking funny.

1323
01:52:28,999 --> 01:52:31,710
I mean, you writers,

1324
01:52:31,835 --> 01:52:34,630
you all write and you never
want to read what you wrote.

1325
01:52:36,381 --> 01:52:38,342
So you strip all night here

1326
01:52:38,467 --> 01:52:40,594
and then you
sit back here and write.

1327
01:52:45,307 --> 01:52:46,934
I'm safe.

1328
01:52:47,059 --> 01:52:49,269
I won't remember it tomorrow.

1329
01:52:56,902 --> 01:53:00,864
Is it a song?

1330
01:53:01,949 --> 01:53:04,034
No, I don't write songs.

1331
01:53:05,244 --> 01:53:07,871
Is it a story?

1332
01:53:09,206 --> 01:53:10,624
No.

1333
01:53:14,586 --> 01:53:16,213
I write poems.

1334
01:53:20,968 --> 01:53:22,636
Poetry.

1335
01:53:22,761 --> 01:53:24,471
I have a friend-

1336
01:53:24,596 --> 01:53:28,267
I had a friend
who used to write poetry.

1337
01:53:29,435 --> 01:53:32,604
He used to call me
and he'd read them to me.

1338
01:53:37,860 --> 01:53:40,195
He wrote really good poems.

1339
01:53:40,279 --> 01:53:42,448
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1340
01:53:44,700 --> 01:53:47,870
It's hard to write good poems.

1341
01:53:51,582 --> 01:53:53,333
It would really...

1342
01:53:55,794 --> 01:53:58,172
be nice to hear a poem again.

1343
01:54:00,299 --> 01:54:02,092
Please?

1344
01:54:15,647 --> 01:54:18,859
"When light shattered
across the floor

1345
01:54:18,942 --> 01:54:21,737
And briefly,
there was a thunder between us,

1346
01:54:21,862 --> 01:54:26,992
If your eyes had held water,
it would have not spilled.

1347
01:54:27,075 --> 01:54:28,994
And when we peeled aside
the dreams,

1348
01:54:29,077 --> 01:54:32,915
the skin underneath
was still young.

1349
01:54:32,998 --> 01:54:34,124
When all was black,

1350
01:54:34,208 --> 01:54:36,877
you smoothed aside
the words and said,

1351
01:54:37,002 --> 01:54:39,588
It's there, the light.

1352
01:54:39,671 --> 01:54:44,301
When you want it,
it'll be waiting for you. '

1353
01:54:44,426 --> 01:54:47,846
A certain peace
came into your eyes

1354
01:54:47,930 --> 01:54:50,099
That this was no different,

1355
01:54:50,224 --> 01:54:53,310
That this was so different,
yet every bit the same,

1356
01:54:54,436 --> 01:54:57,773
And your hands stilled
with satisfaction.

1357
01:54:57,898 --> 01:55:00,692
You did this without touch,

1358
01:55:00,776 --> 01:55:02,444
So that, all around me,

1359
01:55:02,569 --> 01:55:05,656
your hands stood
shaped like shelters.

1360
01:55:06,949 --> 01:55:09,368
All around me there was room,

1361
01:55:09,451 --> 01:55:11,120
And after each hour,

1362
01:55:11,245 --> 01:55:13,997
the hallways outside
were like caverns.

1363
01:55:15,541 --> 01:55:19,586
And around the corner and down
the stairs, there lurked as always

1364
01:55:19,711 --> 01:55:24,675
Light, as ever, light. "

1365
01:55:30,722 --> 01:55:33,183
Is it about a guy?

1366
01:55:33,350 --> 01:55:35,102
No.

1367
01:55:40,524 --> 01:55:42,276
Is it about you?

1368
01:55:48,157 --> 01:55:49,825
No.

1369
01:55:55,497 --> 01:55:57,207
Maybe.

1370
01:55:59,877 --> 01:56:02,713
I'm sorry, I just had a bad day.

1371
01:56:07,384 --> 01:56:10,637
- You have a light?
- Yeah.

1372
01:56:21,482 --> 01:56:23,233
What is it about?

1373
01:56:27,321 --> 01:56:29,823
It's about-

1374
01:56:30,991 --> 01:56:32,910
It's about-

1375
01:56:36,914 --> 01:56:38,332
You know how-

1376
01:56:39,583 --> 01:56:41,919
You know,
like when you're in here,

1377
01:56:43,003 --> 01:56:45,297
and it's always dark.

1378
01:56:45,422 --> 01:56:49,176
It's always like 1:00 a. m.

1379
01:56:53,055 --> 01:56:54,264
It's about...

1380
01:56:56,100 --> 01:56:57,559
morning...

1381
01:56:58,685 --> 01:57:00,395
stuff inside you.

1382
01:57:00,479 --> 01:57:03,023
Stuff inside you.

1383
01:57:05,067 --> 01:57:07,277
Me too.

1384
01:57:11,156 --> 01:57:12,866
It's a nice poem.

1385
01:57:15,244 --> 01:57:17,121
Thank you.

1386
01:57:18,205 --> 01:57:21,083
You know what
a cryptographer is?

1387
01:57:21,208 --> 01:57:23,460
Bobby:
I never paid attention in school.

1388
01:57:25,003 --> 01:57:26,588
It's a code breaker.

1389
01:57:27,798 --> 01:57:29,174
During the war.

1390
01:57:30,426 --> 01:57:32,386
That's what Harry was.

1391
01:57:35,097 --> 01:57:38,058
There are only two or three
of them in the whole world.

1392
01:57:38,142 --> 01:57:39,643
And Harry was one of them.

1393
01:57:40,811 --> 01:57:42,438
He was the best, man.

1394
01:57:46,650 --> 01:57:48,652
That shit's going to kill you, boy.

1395
01:57:48,777 --> 01:57:49,945
I hope so.

1396
01:57:54,992 --> 01:57:57,786
- You want to get something to eat?
- Sure.

1397
01:58:00,581 --> 01:58:03,125
You know,
I'll give that old Jew one thing.

1398
01:58:03,250 --> 01:58:06,628
I hope to God, when I'm that old,
I'll still love pussy like he does.

1399
01:58:06,712 --> 01:58:09,465
Even if I have to use
binoculars to see it.

1400
01:58:12,760 --> 01:58:14,094
Have you ever sang?

1401
01:58:14,219 --> 01:58:16,180
- Sang?
- Yeah.

1402
01:58:16,263 --> 01:58:19,266
Like, in public,
in front of people?

1403
01:58:19,391 --> 01:58:22,603
- Yeah, a long time ago.
- You did?

1404
01:58:22,728 --> 01:58:24,438
Did you get nervous?

1405
01:58:25,564 --> 01:58:26,482
Yeah.

1406
01:58:27,608 --> 01:58:31,487
'Cause Jessie's going
over to Dimples this afternoon.

1407
01:58:31,612 --> 01:58:33,572
They know a place
over in Burbank- karaoke-

1408
01:58:33,655 --> 01:58:36,492
and a bunch of the girls
are going. So...

1409
01:58:36,617 --> 01:58:38,243
- Our girls?
- Yeah.

1410
01:58:38,368 --> 01:58:40,996
Jessie said everybody can sing,
so I thought-

1411
01:58:41,079 --> 01:58:44,500
Eddie:
Fuck, our girls can sing?

1412
01:58:44,583 --> 01:58:46,293
God damn!

1413
01:58:48,253 --> 01:58:50,589
This Russian
motherfucker got shot.

1414
01:58:51,715 --> 01:58:54,760
And some shot.
Right through the heart.

1415
01:58:54,885 --> 01:58:58,514
In the window of his house
in Woodland Hills.

1416
01:58:58,597 --> 01:59:00,265
Bobby:
Quick way to go.

1417
01:59:02,267 --> 01:59:04,436
I thought if
you weren't doing anything,

1418
01:59:04,520 --> 01:59:08,232
if you'd drop by,
we could do it together.

1419
01:59:08,315 --> 01:59:10,734
Like a duet.
Frank and Sammy kind of thing.

1420
01:59:10,859 --> 01:59:12,277
- What time is it?
- 3:00.

1421
01:59:12,444 --> 01:59:15,280
Ah no, man.

1422
01:59:15,364 --> 01:59:17,157
I'll be asleep.
