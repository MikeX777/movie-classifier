01:04:57,624 --> 01:05:00,320
I was outside trying to celebrate by myself.

1122
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:01,570
But I didn't like it.

1123
01:05:01,570 --> 01:05:03,630
What are we celebrating?

1124
01:05:03,630 --> 01:05:05,200
Victory.

1125
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:08,860
I nailed that son of a bitch Latin Jerry.

1126
01:05:08,860 --> 01:05:10,787
I nailed him real good.

1127
01:05:10,787 --> 01:05:12,098
HOLLY: [LAUGHS]

1128
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:17,420
Well, that sounds a little bit more like revenge and victory.

1129
01:05:17,420 --> 01:05:20,540
I think you're right.

1130
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:22,520
So is this some kind of statement that, uh,

1131
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:24,600
tells me you that want to spend the night with me?

1132
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:28,600
Yeah.

1133
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:30,100
Aw.

1134
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:32,320
Drink to that.

1135
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:33,220
[GULPS]

1136
01:05:37,234 --> 01:05:38,134
Mm.

1137
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:44,840
Now, how come I get this, uh, feeling that I'm

1138
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:46,602
harboring a criminal, huh?

1139
01:05:46,602 --> 01:05:47,910
A criminal?

1140
01:05:47,910 --> 01:05:48,950
Yeah.

1141
01:05:48,950 --> 01:05:49,850
I mean, look at you.

1142
01:05:49,850 --> 01:05:51,260
You carry a gun.

1143
01:05:51,260 --> 01:05:54,520
You smoke dope.

1144
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:58,130
You ride a bike that doesn't belong to you.

1145
01:05:58,130 --> 01:06:00,370
What did you do?

1146
01:06:00,370 --> 01:06:02,320
Did you make run on those plates?

1147
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:03,220
Of course I did.

1148
01:06:03,220 --> 01:06:04,200
I'm a cop.

1149
01:06:08,610 --> 01:06:11,090
So, uh, what are you going to do?

1150
01:06:11,090 --> 01:06:13,246
Arrest me?

1151
01:06:13,246 --> 01:06:15,606
Maybe.

1152
01:06:15,606 --> 01:06:18,520
But then first, you'll have to interrogate me.

1153
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:20,360
Do what?

1154
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:22,381
Interrogate me.

1155
01:06:22,381 --> 01:06:25,780
I-- I could do that.

1156
01:06:25,780 --> 01:06:28,620
Then you'll have to strip search me.

1157
01:06:28,620 --> 01:06:31,050
Well, I-- I--

1158
01:06:31,050 --> 01:06:33,140
I could definitely do that, yes.

1159
01:06:33,140 --> 01:06:34,640
Cuff me.

1160
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:36,820
[LAUGHS] Yeah.

1161
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:40,245
And put me behind bars.

1162
01:06:40,245 --> 01:06:43,100
Ooh.

1163
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:46,980
You think it would be all right if I, uh,

1164
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:49,917
dusted your body for prints?

1165
01:06:49,917 --> 01:06:50,915
Oh, yeah.

1166
01:06:53,490 --> 01:06:54,390
Oh, yeah?

1167
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:00,810
Well, hell, I think I should arrest you.

1168
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:06,130
Aw.

1169
01:07:06,130 --> 01:07:07,030
God.

1170
01:07:12,670 --> 01:07:13,570
I'm on top.

1171
01:07:13,570 --> 01:07:15,000
[GIGGLES]

1172
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:15,900
You're right, captain.

1173
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:16,800
He fucked up.

1174
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:19,280
But he's a good man and a good cop

1175
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:21,300
and the only cop that I know that still cares

1176
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:22,835
after 15 years in the force.

1177
01:07:22,835 --> 01:07:24,635
You know, while you're out there with your fundraising

1178
01:07:24,635 --> 01:07:25,950
and your banquets, he's out there

1179
01:07:25,950 --> 01:07:27,240
in the streets with the kids.

1180
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:28,890
I mean, come on, give him a break here.

1181
01:07:34,580 --> 01:07:35,580
You want to see me, captain?

1182
01:07:35,580 --> 01:07:36,747
CAPTAIN: I don't want to see here I

1183
01:07:36,747 --> 01:07:38,940
know you exist in this city until that case is closed.

1184
01:07:38,940 --> 01:07:40,160
You got that?

1185
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:42,150
You're suspended without pay.

1186
01:07:42,150 --> 01:07:44,310
DELBERT: He's just doing his job, captain.

1187
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:45,610
He killed the wrong man.

1188
01:07:45,610 --> 01:07:46,920
What the hell are you talking about?

1189
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:49,980
Two more bodies, same memo.

1190
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:51,960
And this guy's death is covered by the fact

1191
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:54,240
that we were able to link him to three of the murder victims.

1192
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:55,140
That's OK by me.

1193
01:07:55,140 --> 01:07:56,680
Got the mayor off my ass.

1194
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:58,830
But if this headache waste one more wrong person,

1195
01:07:58,830 --> 01:08:00,300
I'll have an investigation team up my butt

1196
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:01,380
in here from Washington, DC.

1197
01:08:01,380 --> 01:08:03,090
And I don't need that.

1198
01:08:03,090 --> 01:08:04,410
I've had it with you.

1199
01:08:04,410 --> 01:08:07,620
You got an officer of the law injured, a good cop.

1200
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:08,520
Assistant.

1201
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:09,460
A what?

1202
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:10,360
Assistant.

1203
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:12,210
That don't play well with me.

1204
01:08:12,210 --> 01:08:14,490
You're lucky you're not under the jail.

1205
01:08:14,490 --> 01:08:18,052
Did you not tell him to pick the man up for questioning?

1206
01:08:18,052 --> 01:08:20,950
Yeah.

1207
01:08:20,950 --> 01:08:22,720
You get the hell out of here before I

1208
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:24,355
put my foot so deep up your ass, your breath

1209
01:08:24,355 --> 01:08:26,270
will smell like shoe polish.

1210
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:27,729
What, you want me out of here, huh?

1211
01:08:27,729 --> 01:08:29,050
You want me out of here? - You deaf?

1212
01:08:29,050 --> 01:08:29,950
Yes.

1213
01:08:29,950 --> 01:08:31,240
I want you out.

1214
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:33,310
And leave the gun and badge.

1215
01:08:33,310 --> 01:08:35,250
Around here is my way or the highway.

1216
01:08:35,250 --> 01:08:36,399
I run this show.

1217
01:08:36,399 --> 01:08:40,460
You're just a pony in my circus.

1218
01:08:40,460 --> 01:08:42,455
And you're a racist asshole.

1219
01:08:42,455 --> 01:08:45,050
What did you call me?

1220
01:08:45,050 --> 01:08:47,060
I called you a racist asshole.

[SCOFFS]

1222
01:08:57,455 --> 01:09:00,240
Did you hear that?

1223
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:02,740
He called me a racist.

1224
01:09:02,740 --> 01:09:04,200
No, captain.

1225
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:05,910
He called you a racist asshole.

1226
01:09:09,030 --> 01:09:09,930
He don't.

1227
01:09:14,910 --> 01:09:15,906
Here you go.

1228
01:09:15,906 --> 01:09:16,806
Here you go.

1229
01:09:20,886 --> 01:09:22,878
Here you go.

1230
01:09:22,878 --> 01:09:24,372
[CHUCKLES]

1231
01:09:36,822 --> 01:09:38,370
HOLLY: Jack.

1232
01:09:38,370 --> 01:09:40,534
Jack, there's somebody here to see you.

1233
01:09:40,534 --> 01:09:41,784
Tell him to go away.

1234
01:09:44,050 --> 01:09:44,950
It's a reporter.

1235
01:09:47,470 --> 01:09:48,970
Then tell him to fuck himself.

1236
01:09:51,499 --> 01:09:52,399
You tell him.

1237
01:09:57,140 --> 01:09:58,395
He's feeling a little down today.

1238
01:10:02,780 --> 01:10:03,680
Ugh.

1239
01:10:18,010 --> 01:10:19,712
May I ask you a question?

1240
01:10:19,712 --> 01:10:21,040
What?

1241
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:22,370
Are you an actress?

1242
01:10:22,370 --> 01:10:25,150
[LAUGHS] No.

1243
01:10:25,150 --> 01:10:27,040
I'm not.

1244
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:28,450
Why would you ask that?

1245
01:10:28,450 --> 01:10:29,630
You look awfully familiar.

1246
01:10:32,530 --> 01:10:33,930
Well, unless you saw a high school

1247
01:10:33,930 --> 01:10:37,830
production of "Joan of Arc" in Mendocino County in 1982,

1248
01:10:37,830 --> 01:10:38,730
I don't think so.

1249
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:45,440
"Joan of Arc," really.

1250
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:47,000
Burned at the stake.

1251
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,257
Can you imagine?

1252
01:10:57,023 --> 01:10:58,170
Are you OK, sweetie?

1253
01:10:58,170 --> 01:10:59,070
Oh, yeah.

1254
01:10:59,070 --> 01:11:00,820
I'm fine.

1255
01:11:00,820 --> 01:11:04,195
Hi, I'm Ray Johnson from "The Times."

1256
01:11:04,195 --> 01:11:06,520
Yeah.

1257
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:07,780
Sorry to intrude on you like this.

1258
01:11:07,780 --> 01:11:11,420
But I missed the press conference today.

1259
01:11:11,420 --> 01:11:12,830
I think I'll leave you two alone.

1260
01:11:12,830 --> 01:11:13,730
Yeah.

1261
01:11:13,730 --> 01:11:14,740
Can I get a drink?

01:11:20,020 --> 01:11:21,750
Do you mind?

1264
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:22,650
What do you want?

1265
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:26,970
You have an impeccable taste in women.

1266
01:11:26,970 --> 01:11:29,120
She's very lovely.

1267
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:30,020
Look, pal.

1268
01:11:30,020 --> 01:11:32,930
Uh, I'm not at liberty to talk about this case.

1269
01:11:32,930 --> 01:11:35,480
And besides, uh, I've been suspended.

1270
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:36,620
All right?

1271
01:11:36,620 --> 01:11:39,770
Well, we don't have to talk about the case, Jack.

1272
01:11:39,770 --> 01:11:43,640
I interview people with dangerous occupations,

1273
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:47,020
people who often come face to face with death.

1274
01:11:47,020 --> 01:11:49,467
For instance, stalking a killer.

1275
01:11:49,467 --> 01:11:51,100
You know, there's really not that much difference

1276
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:52,650
between you and the killer.

1277
01:11:52,650 --> 01:11:53,830
- Oh, really? - Huh.

1278
01:11:53,830 --> 01:11:54,730
Yes.

1279
01:11:54,730 --> 01:11:58,750
I mean, you stalk the killer, the killer stalk someone else.

1280
01:11:58,750 --> 01:12:01,000
You catch the killer, you get a promotion.

1281
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,120
He catches his prey and they're dead.

1282
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:10,414
What does it feel like to kill someone, Jack?

1283
01:12:10,414 --> 01:12:11,650
Oh, come on.

1284
01:12:11,650 --> 01:12:13,690
I understand you send more people to the graveyard

1285
01:12:13,690 --> 01:12:15,336
than you do to jail.

1286
01:12:15,336 --> 01:12:17,005
All right, look, your time is up.

1287
01:12:17,005 --> 01:12:17,905
I'd like you to leave now.

1288
01:12:17,905 --> 01:12:18,805
All right?

1289
01:12:18,805 --> 01:12:21,140
Did you throw Latin Jerry in front of that car, detective?

1290
01:12:24,820 --> 01:12:26,500
You know, I've been--

1291
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:27,660
I've been drinking all day.

1292
01:12:27,660 --> 01:12:31,665
But, uh, I sure as hell ain't that drunk.

1293
01:12:31,665 --> 01:12:33,820
And you tell me you didn't go to the press conference.

1294
01:12:33,820 --> 01:12:36,810
So how the hell do you know his name?

1295
01:12:36,810 --> 01:12:37,895
I saw it on the news.

1296
01:12:37,895 --> 01:12:39,730
You saw it on the news?

1297
01:12:39,730 --> 01:12:42,810
Why don't you take your camera, your news and your fat ass,

1298
01:12:42,810 --> 01:12:44,970
and you get the hell out of my house before I throw you out?

1299
01:12:44,970 --> 01:12:46,033
All right?

1300
01:12:46,033 --> 01:12:47,300
