1
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:06,666
MONAD

2
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,083
SHAMPOO

3
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:26,625
FULL STOP

4
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:08,125
MONAD, SHAMPOO, FULL STOP AND KAREL

5
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:51,208
Peter?

6
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:55,583
Peter?

7
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:57,583
Peter?

8
00:02:58,166 --> 00:02:59,750
-Yes?
-Are you okay?

9
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:04,333
Yeah.

10
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:07,083
You screamed. Is something wrong?

11
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:09,458
Nothing. I'm sleeping.

12
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:12,291
Did you have a bad dream?

13
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:15,750
Damn! Do you hear me?

14
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:19,500
Man, Mom! When I tell you I'm sleeping,
I'm sleeping! Can you leave me alone?

15
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:23,625
If I leave you alone, you won't get out
at all! It's almost noon.

16
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:24,708
Damn it!

17
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:31,500
Jesus Christ!

18
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:32,500
What are you sighing for?

19
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:33,875
-I'm not sighing.
-You're sighing.

20
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:37,208
Do you want eggs for breakfast
or duck for lunch?

21
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:40,541
You've been home for a week
and we haven't talked yet.

22
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:44,416
Mom, please hold on,
I'll be with you in a second, okay?

23
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,750
Duck or eggs?

24
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:02,750
No way, hi, Full Stop, my friend.

25
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:04,041
Hi, Einstein.

26
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:05,500
Hi. I'm glad to hear from you.

27
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:06,875
Are you back yet?

28
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:07,958
<i>I am.</i>

29
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:09,625
And what are you doing?

30
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,791
Nothing, I'm just sitting here.
How about you?

31
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:13,916
<i>Don't even ask.</i>

32
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,250
Some idiots parked next to me

33
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:19,208
so intelligently that
I can't open the car door.

34
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:20,791
It's great you're back.

35
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:21,958
In one piece, I hope.

36
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:25,750
Yeah, listen,
see you at the class reunion, right?

37
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:28,708
Well, I wanted to give it a pass.

38
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:32,958
But if you go, I'll be happy to join you!
We'll celebrate your return.

39
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:38,166
Hold on, buddy, okay? I'll call you
in a second. I need both hands now. Bye.

40
00:04:58,291 --> 00:04:59,291
Hi.

41
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,208
So nice of you to come.

42
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:12,500
What happened?

43
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,750
I just can't anymore.

44
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:20,916
I don't believe anything will be fine
anymore.

45
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,625
My life's completely useless.

46
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:26,041
Nobody needs me and Karel doesn't care
about me anymore.

47
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,291
Karel loves you as much as he can.

48
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,333
He barely talks to me.

49
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:32,708
And I still can't get pregnant.

50
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,916
It's been so long.

51
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:37,625
Karel can't handle it either.

52
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:40,208
We had our anniversary yesterday,

53
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:43,833
so I begged him to spend some time
home with me,

54
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:46,708
but he stayed at work all night again.

55
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:48,625
I…

56
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:51,625
I don't have the strength to keep trying.

57
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:53,875
I feel like I'm bothering him,
I don't know.

58
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:55,541
-Klára.
-Sorry.

59
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:58,000
Come here!

60
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,791
You can't bother anyone, Klára.

61
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:08,333
You're a beautiful, amazing girl.
Everyone would want you!

62
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,291
And Karel wants you too.

63
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:15,583
He just doesn't show it.

64
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:16,666
Thanks.

65
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:38,166
Yeah…

66
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:42,916
So… what kind of food
did you eat at the base?

67
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:46,625
-Just food.
-Well…

68
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:55,208
Were there any nice female colleagues
with you?

69
00:06:58,666 --> 00:06:59,666
Not really.

70
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:07,291
God! Can't you tell me at least
one sentence with more than two words?

71
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:12,208
Do you think any woman would be able to
communicate with you like this?

72
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,166
I don't want to run…

73
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:25,500
Girls, for God's sake,
can you turn the TV off?

74
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:32,708
Hello, this is Dad's cell phone.

75
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:34,333
What?

76
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:36,500
<i>-Poop!</i>
<i>-You mustn't say that!</i>

77
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,625
<i>-Dáda, come here.</i>
<i>-Give me the cell phone!</i>

78
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:39,708
<i>Monad?</i>

79
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:42,041
Ema, give me the cell phone! Ema!

80
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:43,583
Stop it!

81
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:45,833
Ema, give it here.

82
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:51,583
Dáda, don't be silly, you had a fever
not even an hour ago. Give it here.

83
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:53,166
Enough!

84
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:06,916
Oh man! Wait! Oh God.

85
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:11,458
Prepare a comparative analysis
of all similar systems. Yeah?

86
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:12,333
Thanks.

87
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:15,958
I'm home for a second,
but I'll be in the office in a minute.

88
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:19,666
Klára?

89
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:25,458
Hi.

90
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:26,666
Hello.

91
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,875
Is something wrong?

92
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:29,958
Nothing.

93
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,541
What are you doing here?

94
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,291
You're not wearing your panties?

95
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:46,750
Is anyone in here?

96
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:19,916
What on earth is going on?

97
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:25,166
Why are you looking at me like that?

98
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,583
I'm waiting for your reaction.

99
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,833
Have you just had sex in here?

100
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,750
Can you answer my question?

101
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:38,291
-And what if I did? Would you mind?
-What?

102
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:41,500
I don't know.
Maybe you wouldn't mind at all.

103
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:46,500
You know what? We'll talk about it when
we're both calm. Yeah? When you're calm.

104
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:48,583
Wait. Wait, is that all?

105
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:53,041
You won't even give me a slap
knowing what I did here?

106
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:10,458
Yes? Hi.

107
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:12,125
Hi.

108
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:15,125
Are you going to the class reunion today?

109
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:18,125
The reunion? Tonight? Yeah, yeah.

110
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:19,791
Why are you whispering?

111
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:21,291
I'm in a meeting, you know?

112
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:26,166
I'm sorry. So see you later.
I think we should get drunk today, buddy.

113
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,208
Sure.

114
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:28,291
Bye.

115
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:33,208
Oh man.

116
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:39,291
Oh man.

117
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:40,375
Damn!

118
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:46,958
Hi, girls.

119
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:48,333
Hi, Mom!

120
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:52,708
Where have you been? I was supposed
to be at work a long time ago.

121
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:55,666
So what? Boy or girl?

122
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:07,333
Stop crying.
We know how to handle girls, don't we?

123
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:11,125
Will you love her?

124
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:12,625
Of course I will.

125
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:18,625
Bye, bye, bye.

126
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:35,875
Dear God! Why do I have to have
a pussy farm at home?

127
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,958
Shit, shit, shit, shit!

128
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:50,166
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus!

129
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:55,250
I know, I know, well, sure, well,
upstairs. Okay, okay, I'm already here.

130
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,250
Here it is, here, here.

131
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:08,000
Hello?

132
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:11,958
What do you think you're doing, you idiot?
Where have you been all morning?

133
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,250
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

134
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:17,708
My wife was delayed at the gynecologist
and the girls broke my cell phone.

135
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:21,750
I can't jeopardize my contract with
the biggest Asian travel agency

136
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:24,791
because of your personal issues!
Come pack your things. You're done here!

137
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,416
What do you mean by that?

138
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,375
You're fired!

139
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:30,875
Moron!

140
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:33,375
Hello? Hello?

141
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:42,125
Guys, here you go.
Wait, I still have two more.

142
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:46,833
Okay, thanks.

143
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:50,750
Just keep laughing until
you have hemorrhoids too!

144
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:53,583
But you won't laugh anymore then.

145
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:00,666
Stop!

146
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:04,083
Can you sit down a bit slower
and groan a bit more?

147
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:05,958
It'll look funnier. Thanks.

148
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:10,791
I've had enough! I refuse to make
humor out of repulsiveness.

149
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,708
You should be ashamed, director.

150
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,416
Calm down and start thinking about

151
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,541
how much money
you make by sitting on that ring.

152
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:17,625
Can we continue?

153
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:20,291
This is the bottom of TV entertainment.

154
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:24,041
You don't even care, because you haven't
shot anything good in your life.

155
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:30,041
But I've done fifty years of honest work,
I'm sick of all of this!

156
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,875
Ten-minute break.

157
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:07,583
We can shoot.

158
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:09,041
Grandma is fine now.

159
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:12,916
What is the girl
in the corridor doing here?

160
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,791
She came to sign a contract.

161
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:17,666
She came to the casting with her son
for one of those new children's roles.

162
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,208
He's a very clever boy.
He'll be in a few episodes.

163
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:22,416
How old is he?

164
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:23,916
About six.

165
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,166
What does he look like?

166
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,791
Do you want to see the casting video?

167
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:31,583
I'll play it for you when you come back.

168
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:41,541
<i>I came up with a lot of ideas, yoo-hoo</i>

169
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:45,000
<i>which are great for a silly mood</i>

170
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:50,500
<i>Yoo-hoo, throw the keys in the gutter,</i>
<i>slide down a bare rock</i>

171
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:55,125
-What's up?
-<i>Haunt a castle at night, yoo-hoo…</i>

172
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:56,291
Are you okay?

173
00:15:58,791 --> 00:15:59,791
I'm not.

174
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,750
-What's going on?
-It's Karel. It's Karel. Karel, no way!

175
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:37,958
Karel! Hi, Karel.

176
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:41,166
What are you doing here?
You've come, great!

177
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:47,541
Karel, dear Karel. You rich boy!

178
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:48,833
Show me your car.

179
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:50,833
-Can I kiss you?
-Hi, girls. I don't know.

180
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:54,333
I'd like one too.
I've never kissed a millionaire before.

181
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:57,625
There, there, what do we have here?
A bald patch!

182
00:16:57,708 --> 00:16:59,833
Bald men are really sexy!

183
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:02,375
Especially when they make
as much money as you.

184
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:05,375
Will you marry me and take care of me?
I could get easily divorced.

185
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,333
I'll think about it, okay?

186
00:17:07,415 --> 00:17:11,333
Girls, you know what?
Let's get out, I'll buy you a drink.

187
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:16,500
Jesus, girls. Monad and Full Stop.
Hi. Come in!

188
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:17,708
Hi! Hey!

189
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:20,208
-I wanted to be the first one. Hi.
-Hi.

190
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:23,290
-Hi. Hi, girls. Hello.
-So I'm the last one, hi.

191
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,958
So where did you go, you talented man?

192
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,415
-Why don't we see you on TV?
-Well…

193
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,041
You wanted to be a singer, didn't you?

194
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:30,791
-Yeah, yeah.
-So what? So what?

195
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:33,291
-Well, it didn't work out.
-What a pity.

196
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:34,666
Hi, guys!

197
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:39,166
-Hello.
-What are you doing?

198
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,541
Come here!

199
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:43,375
Jesus Christ, Mary!

200
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:49,791
Hello, you old wanker!

201
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:52,666
Hi, potato head, hello.
I'm glad to see you.

202
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,750
Me too.

203
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:56,041
-Hi, hi.
-Hello.

204
00:17:56,291 --> 00:18:02,208
Six, five, four, three, two, one, zero.

205
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:10,916
I don't know, man, but I wouldn't applaud
myself for my life's performance.

206
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,708
You? Why not?

207
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:14,416
You're on easy street after all.

208
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,416
Who else should applaud
himself if not you?

209
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:20,791
Well, looks can be deceiving, mates.
I'm pretty fucked up.

210
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:21,791
Rubbish, man.

211
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,875
The star is here! He is here.

212
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:25,166
Hi, hi! Hello.

213
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:29,875
Hi, girls. Hello.

214
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:34,500
Oh dear, you're even cuter than on TV!

215
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:36,041
See you later, yeah.

216
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,208
-Hello.
-Hi.

217
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:40,333
Hello.

218
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:41,875
Did they jump on you too?

219
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:43,625
These moms are the worst.

220
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:44,625
Yes?

221
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:47,083
Karel, please, don't be mad at me.

222
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:48,000
I…

223
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:49,000
Three vodkas.

224
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:50,833
I just want to tell you

225
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:54,208
that what happened in the morning
meant nothing at all.

226
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:55,458
He's got a serious phone call.

227
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:57,916
<i>It shouldn't have happened at all.</i>

228
00:18:58,875 --> 00:18:59,875
Do you hear me?

229
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:01,625
Yeah.

230
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:05,500
I just need to know

231
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:07,791
<i>if you still care about me.</i>

232
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:13,958
So you slept with someone to see if
I care about you?

233
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:18,250
Will you come home?

234
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:22,166
I feel sick when I imagine
how you must be feeling right now.

235
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,083
Just calm down.

236
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:26,375
I'm actually feeling pretty good at
the moment.

237
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:27,416
And where are you?

238
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,750
I'm with the boys, at the class reunion.

239
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,750
-Shit.
-What's up?

240
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:41,333
My wife's cheating on me.

241
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,083
Do you know with whom?

242
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,000
I don't know shit, buddy!

243
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:54,166
Hi.

244
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:56,166
Hello.

245
00:19:57,208 --> 00:20:00,000
We're still waiting for you, lecher!

246
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:02,541
Join us later, movie star,
we have to take a picture with you.

247
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:03,625
Sure.

248
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:05,750
Listen, shall we go somewhere else?

249
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:06,833
Where?

250
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,750
Well, I don't know. Somewhere better.

251
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:39,166
CURRENT BALANCE: 60 CZK

252
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,250
No shit!

253
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:47,791
Excellent, Full Stop! Go for it!

254
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:50,791
Do you think you could get me
a job in the TV studio?

255
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,333
Sure thing.

256
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,958
If you need money, I'll lend you some.

257
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:57,500
I need to earn, not borrow.

258
00:20:57,583 --> 00:21:00,333
I'll give you some money, no problem.

259
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:03,916
So you think I'm completely incompetent?
I don't want you to give me anything.

260
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,750
It's okay. I don't think anything.
I just want to help you. Calm down!

261
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:15,291
What are you doing? What are you doing?

262
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:18,250
Come on, come on down!

263
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:20,750
-Okay. But what's up?
-Move it!

264
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:24,125
-Come on!
-I wasn't doing anything bad.

265
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:28,208
Oh shit! Fuck!

266
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:30,125
Oh shit!

267
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:32,500
Guys, it's really great in here!

268
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:40,791
Fuck! We have to go back!

269
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:41,916
Move it!

270
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:46,833
Come on, man!

271
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:04,416
This way! This way, man!

272
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,791
Here, here, up here!

273
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:14,416
-Where're we going, man?
-Go, go, go!

274
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:32,041
Oh man, guys! That was really great!

275
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:34,208
We're still fast, aren't we?!

276
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,708
-My left testicle hurts really bad.
-What?

277
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:37,833
Because of that fight?

278
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:39,125
No. I've had it for a long time.

279
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:43,000
Isn't it because
of the Afghan desert loneliness?

280
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:44,833
You know what to do.

281
00:22:44,916 --> 00:22:45,833
No.

282
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:47,000
No? What do you mean?

283
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:49,791
It's called a furlough, mate.

284
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:56,041
I wouldn't want to end up here.

285
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,708
Neither would I.

286
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:01,625
I want my ashes to be scattered

287
00:23:01,708 --> 00:23:05,916
from a beautiful sports car
at a very high speed.

288
00:23:07,541 --> 00:23:13,291
When we were at high school,
I thought life would be much better.

289
00:23:14,625 --> 00:23:17,000
You see? And I actually envy you.

290
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:18,958
What's there to envy?

291
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:22,833
You have a wife who loves you.
And you have children.

292
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:26,291
I envy Shampoo, actually.

293
00:23:26,458 --> 00:23:27,583
And what exactly?

294
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:28,791
Your lifestyle.

295
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:32,458
I don't even know if I'm still alive.

296
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:34,875
I just film shitty things for money,

297
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:38,000
things that would have made me sick
at high school.

298
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:43,750
Man, you can do whatever you want,
fuck whoever you want.

299
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:47,416
You don't have kids. You're free!

300
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:54,291
Oh man, guys!

301
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,875
We have to do something like this again!
Otherwise we'll end up like

302
00:23:57,958 --> 00:24:01,125
complete bastards!
It can't go on like this.

303
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:05,750
Do you remember how we ran naked all over
the school right before the leaving exam?

304
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:09,250
That was the last really crazy thing
I did, man!

305
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:12,541
Have you noticed that when he's drunk
he doesn't stammer at all?

306
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:15,541
-You speak so well.
-It'd be good for us.

307
00:24:15,708 --> 00:24:19,250
Maybe it would refresh us if we did
something like that again.

308
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:22,541
Running around with my exposed member
wouldn't refresh me at all.

309
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:23,875
And I know that for sure.

310
00:24:23,958 --> 00:24:25,500
-How do you know that?
-I just know it.

311
00:24:25,583 --> 00:24:28,208
Some crazy shit might cheer you up.

312
00:24:28,291 --> 00:24:33,916
Exactly! Maybe you don't understand Klára
anymore because you're too logical now.

313
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,791
Buddy, thank you for your therapy.
Thanks a lot.

314
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:39,916
It's better to start stripping
than doing nothing at all, man.

315
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,125
I'd really set it as a task for us.

316
00:24:43,208 --> 00:24:44,166
Set it?

317
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:45,958
Wait,
why should I strip in the first place?

318
00:24:46,041 --> 00:24:48,791
To see if there's still some punk in you,
you see?

319
00:24:48,875 --> 00:24:49,916
What punk?

320
00:24:50,416 --> 00:24:51,958
You're in midlife crisis!

321
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:53,750
I'm not in any crisis.

322
00:24:53,833 --> 00:24:56,208
Man, you live with your mom!

323
00:24:56,291 --> 00:24:58,000
Well, it's because I like her.

324
00:24:58,083 --> 00:25:00,541
I am thirsty. Let's have a drink.

325
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:01,750
Sure.

326
00:25:01,916 --> 00:25:03,708
We have to drink, guys.

327
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,916
Open up!

328
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,833
<i>He drank warm rum though it made him sick</i>

329
00:25:07,916 --> 00:25:10,875
<i>He thought it was a sign of punk</i>

330
00:25:10,958 --> 00:25:13,500
<i>He smoked whatever was on fire</i>

331
00:25:13,583 --> 00:25:16,666
<i>He thought it was a sign of punk</i>

332
00:25:17,875 --> 00:25:22,291
<i>But the boys said punk was elsewhere</i>

333
00:25:27,625 --> 00:25:31,583
Whoever strips first shall launch
a fight against said crisis.

334
00:25:31,666 --> 00:25:33,541
But not alone at home.

335
00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:38,083
Not alone at home.
In public and amongst other people.

336
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:42,208
He has to stay naked
for a minute and hide nothing.

337
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:46,875
And he has to film it on his cell phone
and send the video to the others.

338
00:25:46,958 --> 00:25:50,875
And the receiver has to strip right away,
too. Wherever he is.

339
00:25:50,958 --> 00:25:53,541
And whoever breaks the rule is a bastard!

340
00:25:53,625 --> 00:25:55,416
A real bastard.

341
00:25:55,541 --> 00:25:57,000
God, that's such bullshit.

342
00:25:57,083 --> 00:25:58,166
It's good!

343
00:26:01,416 --> 00:26:02,625
It's great!

344
00:26:12,083 --> 00:26:13,208
<i>Karel?</i>

345
00:26:15,708 --> 00:26:20,666
Do you think it's possible for two people
to stay happy all their lives?

346
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:24,416
Why does everything beautiful
have to go wrong?

347
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:26,916
Are you listening to me?

348
00:26:27,791 --> 00:26:28,791
Karel?

349
00:26:30,166 --> 00:26:31,291
-Karel.
<i>-Karel.</i>

350
00:26:32,166 --> 00:26:33,458
-Karel.
<i>-Karel.</i>

351
00:26:34,833 --> 00:26:38,583
Karel! The Americans are here.

352
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,083
What Americans?

353
00:26:41,291 --> 00:26:44,416
Man, wake up! You're selling your business
for 500 million!

354
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,083
So what? Oh yeah.

355
00:26:46,708 --> 00:26:48,625
And do you think it's a good decision?

356
00:26:48,708 --> 00:26:52,083
We've already talked about it, haven't we?
A thousand times. Haven't we?

357
00:26:52,166 --> 00:26:53,625
Yeah, that's right.

358
00:26:53,791 --> 00:26:58,166
I just don't know where the enthusiasm
with which we'd built all this has gone.

359
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,625
Don't scare me! Man! Don't scare me!

360
00:27:00,708 --> 00:27:03,458
Should I remind you why
it is a good thing to sell it right now?

361
00:27:03,541 --> 00:27:05,708
No one will ever offer us more money.

362
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:09,416
You said it yourself! Didn't you say that?
You did.

363
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,500
Yeah!

364
00:27:11,083 --> 00:27:12,833
Do you know what's really bad?

365
00:27:12,916 --> 00:27:19,291
Recently, I haven't made a single decision
just because I wanted to make it.

366
00:27:19,375 --> 00:27:21,583
I do everything just because
it's reasonable.

367
00:27:21,666 --> 00:27:22,833
Karel…

368
00:27:23,416 --> 00:27:26,791
I think it's starting to piss me off
a little bit.

369
00:27:27,541 --> 00:27:28,541
Sorry.

370
00:27:29,625 --> 00:27:32,250
I guess I need to throw up. Sorry.

371
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:50,000
-It doesn't feel right to me.
-Same here.

372
00:27:50,708 --> 00:27:54,833
Why is he selling the company
when it's doing so well?

373
00:27:54,958 --> 00:27:56,916
Maybe because he's burnt out.

374
00:27:57,083 --> 00:27:59,833
Too bad he doesn't have the same balls
he did ten years ago.

375
00:27:59,916 --> 00:28:01,916
Yeah, he definitely doesn't.

376
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:29,708
Where're we gonna eat?

377
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:31,500
We could order something.

378
00:28:31,916 --> 00:28:34,791
Excuse me, can you film me please?

379
00:28:36,166 --> 00:28:37,208
Thank you.

380
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:51,625
-Good morning, Lucie.
-Good morning, Karel.

381
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:32,666
Knock the door down, search the room
and neutralize me. Is that clear?

382
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:33,750
Yes.

383
00:29:33,833 --> 00:29:35,750
Who wants to be a hostage?

384
00:29:39,583 --> 00:29:40,625
You?

385
00:29:41,791 --> 00:29:42,791
Good.

386
00:29:42,958 --> 00:29:46,291
Divide into groups
and don't do anything stupid.

387
00:29:46,416 --> 00:29:49,250
Whoever hits the hostage has to run around
the compound ten times in full gear.

388
00:29:49,333 --> 00:29:50,333
Let's go.

389
00:29:51,958 --> 00:29:53,625
POLICE

390
00:30:03,333 --> 00:30:04,708
What should I do?

391
00:30:04,791 --> 00:30:09,541
Just act… normal. Like a hostage.

392
00:30:10,541 --> 00:30:15,583
Then you should stop me
from running away, Captain.

393
00:30:17,541 --> 00:30:19,000
What are you talking about?

394
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:20,125
Can I scream?

395
00:30:20,791 --> 00:30:22,625
Just act normal, man.

396
00:30:22,833 --> 00:30:27,333
If you think you'll earn your credit
with your tits, you're wrong.

397
00:30:27,791 --> 00:30:30,791
So hide those again!

398
00:30:32,083 --> 00:30:34,000
I don't care about my credit.

399
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:36,375
I just want to have a bed by the window.

400
00:30:36,458 --> 00:30:38,000
What? What bed?

401
00:30:38,416 --> 00:30:43,833
The girls in the dorm won't let me sleep
by the window unless we go on a date.

402
00:30:43,958 --> 00:30:46,125
Would you like to go on a date?

403
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,875
Don't even touch me.

404
00:30:49,958 --> 00:30:52,250
I was on a mission for a year,
I'm as horny as a desert billy-goat.

405
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:54,375
I could break you in half!

406
00:30:54,458 --> 00:30:56,750
You'd better leave me alone!
Is that clear?

407
00:30:56,833 --> 00:30:57,833
Yeah.

408
00:31:04,208 --> 00:31:07,125
<i>-Good morning, Lucie.</i>
<i>-Good morning, Karel.</i>

409
00:31:08,583 --> 00:31:09,791
Shit.

410
00:31:10,916 --> 00:31:12,250
Is something wrong?

411
00:31:12,333 --> 00:31:14,583
Sit in that chair!

412
00:31:15,416 --> 00:31:17,208
Sit down!

413
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:20,416
Hands behind your head!

414
00:31:20,666 --> 00:31:22,416
<i>Go, go, go!</i>

415
00:31:24,791 --> 00:31:27,333
Don't look at me.

416
00:31:39,958 --> 00:31:41,583
Don't look!

417
00:31:44,166 --> 00:31:45,166
Action!

418
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:49,375
Don't look!

419
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:01,750
Police, police! Police, police!

420
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,500
What's up?

421
00:32:15,416 --> 00:32:17,916
You're supposed to neutralize me,
not stare at my dick.

422
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,291
Call the others!

423
00:32:47,083 --> 00:32:48,250
Hi.

424
00:32:53,625 --> 00:32:56,291
I'm so happy you called me last night!

425
00:32:57,791 --> 00:32:59,916
You just shouldn't drink that much.

426
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,666
You were completely… tiny.

427
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:08,291
But it doesn't matter!
We'll work that out.

428
00:33:08,375 --> 00:33:11,958
What matters is that we're together
at last!

429
00:33:16,333 --> 00:33:20,375
What will you have for breakfast?
I'm gonna get something.

430
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:25,875
Could you get me the casting boy's
mom's phone number?

431
00:33:26,083 --> 00:33:27,083
Yeah.

432
00:33:28,125 --> 00:33:29,250
And go home?

433
00:33:30,791 --> 00:33:34,500
I don't want to go home.
I want to be here with you.

434
00:33:35,291 --> 00:33:36,333
Go home!

435
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:07,625
<i>Healthy. Tasty. Fragrant.</i>

436
00:34:08,416 --> 00:34:10,916
<i>-That's me.</i>
<i>-That's me.</i>

437
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,083
<i>Traditional. Instant. Vegetable.</i>

438
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:18,791
<i>Yeah, every gourmet dreams…</i>

439
00:34:18,916 --> 00:34:21,000
-What else I can do for you?
<i>-…of instant soup.</i>

440
00:34:21,083 --> 00:34:24,166
-I have to leave now for a while, okay?
-Hi.

441
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:25,250
Hi!

442
00:34:26,041 --> 00:34:28,583
What am I going to do here, please?

443
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:29,708
Kitty?

444
00:34:29,791 --> 00:34:32,083
-The leek costume, please.
-Is that him?

445
00:34:32,166 --> 00:34:33,875
-I'm Carolina.
-Good morning!

446
00:34:33,958 --> 00:34:36,708
You're gonna be absolutely wonderful!
Really.

447
00:34:36,791 --> 00:34:39,583
Are you sure I won't spoil it for you?

448
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:41,625
It can't be spoiled.

449
00:34:41,708 --> 00:34:44,750
I owe you one, I'm really screwed.

450
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,958
The girls need winter clothes,

451
00:34:47,041 --> 00:34:51,416
the washing machine broke down
in the morning and Ľubica reminded me that

452
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:55,750
I promised to buy a car
which can fit four baby seats.

453
00:34:55,875 --> 00:34:57,583
Do you like it, director?

454
00:34:57,666 --> 00:34:59,291
Yes, I do. I do.

455
00:35:01,875 --> 00:35:05,375
You're gonna hop around the pot for a day
and you'll earn 20 grand.

456
00:35:05,458 --> 00:35:09,291
And you don't even have to rehearse
anything. Just try on the costume.

457
00:35:09,375 --> 00:35:12,916
You're amazing!
Shall we go for lunch later?

458
00:35:13,458 --> 00:35:17,791
Listen, I have some errands to do.
The girls will take care of you. Bye.

459
00:35:17,875 --> 00:35:19,041
Bye. Bye.

460
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,791
It is you! Hi. Hello.

461
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:28,791
Gábo!

462
00:35:28,875 --> 00:35:30,083
What are you doing here?

463
00:35:30,166 --> 00:35:31,583
What are you doing here?

464
00:35:31,666 --> 00:35:33,791
I have to earn a living, don't I?
What about you?

465
00:35:33,875 --> 00:35:36,541
Ah, I'm sort of saving the family budget.

466
00:35:36,625 --> 00:35:39,166
Jesus! Will you save me too?

467
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:40,541
-You?
-Yeah.

468
00:35:40,791 --> 00:35:42,250
Our singer got sick.

469
00:35:42,333 --> 00:35:46,333
I play old pop hits with my band.
Heidi Janků, Helena Vondráčková,

470
00:35:46,416 --> 00:35:50,333
Marie Rottrová. We have a gig tonight
and I don't have a singer.

471
00:35:50,416 --> 00:35:54,208
I've called everyone.
I just forgot about you.

472
00:35:54,375 --> 00:35:58,000
How many years has it been since
we played together? Twenty?

473
00:35:58,083 --> 00:36:00,208
If you take the job,
I'll give you five grand.

474
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:04,666
Why don't you look for a female singer?
It's all female hits.

475
00:36:04,791 --> 00:36:08,083
Wait. Look.

476
00:36:10,458 --> 00:36:14,833
It's just fun. And with your voice,
it's really easy money.

477
00:36:16,666 --> 00:36:19,458
It won't be more embarrassing than
this costume.

478
00:36:19,541 --> 00:36:21,166
Wait, I'll get a CD.

479
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:23,375
Well, it's perfect.

480
00:36:23,458 --> 00:36:25,333
I told you you'd be great.

481
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:29,333
You're absolutely ideal for it,
you see? Cool!

482
00:36:29,416 --> 00:36:32,208
Alright, girls, let's check the carrot.

483
00:37:00,291 --> 00:37:05,583
Good morning,
I'm calling about the vacancy.

484
00:37:08,083 --> 00:37:10,041
I see, goodbye.

485
00:37:12,583 --> 00:37:16,083
I'm calling about the job offer.

486
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:18,666
Taken already, I see.

487
00:37:18,791 --> 00:37:22,291
I'm calling about the vacancy.

488
00:37:22,458 --> 00:37:25,791
Hello? Hello?

489
00:37:30,583 --> 00:37:32,541
KINDERGARTEN, HOLIČKOVA

490
00:37:38,041 --> 00:37:41,500
Scratch, scratch, scratch, scratch,
tickle, tickle, tickle

491
00:37:41,583 --> 00:37:46,291
and the monkey gets a banana and an apple
and what else do I give her?

492
00:37:46,375 --> 00:37:48,250
This is what the monkey does
and then keeps jumping.

493
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:50,041
Good morning.

494
00:37:50,125 --> 00:37:52,625
-Where's the headmaster's office, please?
-Over there.

495
00:37:52,708 --> 00:37:54,333
-And what else does the monkey do?
-Thank you.

496
00:37:54,416 --> 00:37:57,666
It swings, it swings like this…

497
00:38:00,625 --> 00:38:04,250
You play the piano, you can sing,
you studied the Faculty of Education,

498
00:38:04,333 --> 00:38:07,916
you can start at once
and you can't get pregnant.

499
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,625
These are perfect prerequisites.
The job is yours, of course.

500
00:38:10,708 --> 00:38:11,666
Thank you.

501
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:14,583
I'll get the contract, give me a sec.

502
00:38:14,833 --> 00:38:17,666
I'll need your ID and account number.

503
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:20,833
I just need to set up the printer.
It's a bit chaotic here right now.

504
00:38:22,958 --> 00:38:25,500
You'll be the first guy in our staff.

505
00:38:30,791 --> 00:38:34,125
Three girls already
and a fourth one on the way.

506
00:38:35,125 --> 00:38:36,708
You're a deserving daddy.

507
00:38:36,791 --> 00:38:38,666
<i>Police, police.</i>

508
00:38:42,208 --> 00:38:43,083
<i>What's up?</i>

509
00:38:43,166 --> 00:38:44,041
Almost done.

510
00:38:44,125 --> 00:38:46,166
<i>You're supposed to neutralize me,</i>
<i>not stare at my dick.</i>

511
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:47,250
Okay.

512
00:38:50,583 --> 00:38:51,750
Here you go.

513
00:38:53,416 --> 00:38:54,875
Is there something is wrong?

514
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:58,125
No, quite to the contrary.

515
00:38:58,208 --> 00:38:59,416
Great!

516
00:39:04,458 --> 00:39:09,041
Great,
it's in there and now another eight…

517
00:39:16,541 --> 00:39:19,125
And the figure got blocked…

518
00:39:21,416 --> 00:39:22,416
Yes?

519
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,791
You can't go there, you can't…

520
00:39:25,958 --> 00:39:27,875
Excuse me, children. Sorry.

521
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,500
What is it? Did you forget something?

522
00:39:32,875 --> 00:39:37,875
No, no, no,
I just need to do something in here.

523
00:39:38,375 --> 00:39:39,375
I see.

524
00:39:43,333 --> 00:39:44,583
What are you doing?

525
00:39:44,666 --> 00:39:49,333
Sorry. It's just a game.
I'll get dressed in a minute.

526
00:39:49,458 --> 00:39:50,416
Stop it!

527
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:53,833
I'd love to, but I can't. Don't be angry.

528
00:39:53,916 --> 00:39:58,250
Leave immediately!
No, get dressed first and then leave.

529
00:39:58,333 --> 00:40:03,291
No, don't worry, I'm not a pervert,
you don't even have to look at me.

530
00:40:03,375 --> 00:40:05,666
-Mr. Mach.
-I'll disappear, a minute.

531
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:06,625
Yes?

532
00:40:06,708 --> 00:40:10,083
Could you make this man leave
and get dressed?

533
00:40:10,208 --> 00:40:12,875
No, it's not necessary!
I'll leave on my own in a minute.

534
00:40:12,958 --> 00:40:15,875
Why are you taking it in your hand?
Put your clothes on, pervert!

535
00:40:15,958 --> 00:40:18,000
Did you hear the headmistress or not?

536
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:20,791
Unfortunately, I can't obey you.

537
00:40:23,958 --> 00:40:26,416
That's my pleasure…

538
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:31,166
Look, the man's bum's out!

539
00:40:38,291 --> 00:40:43,750
KINDERGARTEN

540
00:40:49,583 --> 00:40:56,458
I'm not a pussy!
Oh man, I'm not! Punk's not dead.

541
00:40:58,833 --> 00:41:02,000
<i>My dear, give me more of your love!</i>
<i>Yoo-hoo.</i>

542
00:41:02,083 --> 00:41:04,500
Please, Matthew!
Stop fooling around and get dressed.

543
00:41:04,583 --> 00:41:06,458
<i>-I want almost nothing…</i>
<i>-We were supposed to leave</i>

544
00:41:06,541 --> 00:41:11,125
-a long time ago, you know?
<i>-I just want to pet your hair. Yoo-hoo.</i>

545
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:16,250
Yes?

546
00:41:40,791 --> 00:41:43,958
I don't think I should meet Matthew.

547
00:41:45,416 --> 00:41:47,916
It's better that he doesn't know me.

548
00:41:49,333 --> 00:41:53,166
Should I tell him they found someone else
for the part?

549
00:41:53,833 --> 00:41:56,041
It would turn out badly.

550
00:41:57,291 --> 00:42:00,416
Do you think it could be even worse
than now?

551
00:42:01,166 --> 00:42:03,166
Maybe you'd like each other.

552
00:42:04,791 --> 00:42:06,166
He takes after you.

553
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:08,791
Yeah?

554
00:42:14,958 --> 00:42:16,791
What are you afraid of?

555
00:42:28,291 --> 00:42:30,500
<i>Leave immediately!</i>

556
00:42:30,583 --> 00:42:33,083
<i>No, don't worry, I'm not a pervert…</i>

557
00:42:35,916 --> 00:42:36,958
What's up?

558
00:42:43,333 --> 00:42:44,375
I'm sorry.

559
00:43:34,458 --> 00:43:35,708
The doctor isn't working today?

560
00:43:35,791 --> 00:43:39,458
He's on holiday. I'm his substitute.
What's the matter?

561
00:43:39,541 --> 00:43:40,625
I'll come back later.

562
00:43:40,708 --> 00:43:42,708
But that'll be in two weeks.

563
00:43:44,541 --> 00:43:45,541
I see.

564
00:43:46,416 --> 00:43:48,125
Do you have any problems?

565
00:43:51,958 --> 00:43:53,250
It's my testicle.

566
00:43:54,333 --> 00:43:55,583
Come on in.

567
00:44:11,583 --> 00:44:12,708
Does this hurt?

568
00:44:12,791 --> 00:44:13,791
Yeah.

569
00:44:26,041 --> 00:44:28,208
Do you need to make
a phone call right now?

570
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:29,291
Yeah.

571
00:44:34,458 --> 00:44:36,125
Hi, Mom! How are you?

572
00:44:38,875 --> 00:44:40,375
Do you need something?

573
00:44:42,583 --> 00:44:46,208
Your leg hurts? Well, I'll get you
something. Tell me what you need.

574
00:44:46,291 --> 00:44:49,208
Okay, coffee. And milk, right?

575
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:52,458
Cabbage, alright,
I'll get you some mineral water, too.

576
00:44:52,541 --> 00:44:55,833
It looks like prostatitis.
Lie on your side now.

577
00:44:58,083 --> 00:44:59,125
Yeah.

578
00:44:59,416 --> 00:45:02,791
You know what?
It's better if you text me, okay?

579
00:45:03,083 --> 00:45:05,291
All right, have a nice day. Bye.

580
00:45:05,375 --> 00:45:08,875
Ouch! Oh. Man.

581
00:45:14,791 --> 00:45:19,041
Pee into this thing. We'll do some tests
and I'll give you antibiotics.

582
00:45:19,125 --> 00:45:21,166
And I want your semen in this.

583
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:22,541
Right now?

584
00:45:23,416 --> 00:45:25,166
No. That's your homework.

585
00:45:25,833 --> 00:45:28,916
Do you think
I can manage to put it in there?

586
00:45:29,291 --> 00:45:30,375
Yes, I do.

587
00:45:38,916 --> 00:45:41,958
Would you like to go for a coffee with me?

588
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:44,666
Bring me the urine!

589
00:46:38,625 --> 00:46:39,791
Hello.

590
00:46:45,208 --> 00:46:47,166
Are you going somewhere?

591
00:46:49,125 --> 00:46:50,166
Yeah.

592
00:46:53,291 --> 00:46:55,291
Alone or with someone?

593
00:46:55,791 --> 00:46:57,041
Does it matter?

594
00:46:58,958 --> 00:47:00,250
Are you in love?

595
00:47:02,875 --> 00:47:05,666
Do you even want to keep living with me?

596
00:47:07,125 --> 00:47:09,500
You slept with someone. I didn't.

597
00:47:11,458 --> 00:47:13,333
Why do I feel absolutely nothing from you?

598
00:47:13,416 --> 00:47:15,041
I'm sorry, but what do you want from me?

599
00:47:15,125 --> 00:47:19,833
Should I bring you a flower
and persuade you to stop cheating on me?

600
00:47:21,708 --> 00:47:23,458
Should I go or stay here?

601
00:47:25,875 --> 00:47:28,041
If you need to go, just go.

602
00:47:29,208 --> 00:47:31,083
What am I supposed to say?

603
00:47:33,041 --> 00:47:34,791
Anything but this.

604
00:47:50,875 --> 00:47:53,916
You should dress a little better.

605
00:47:54,375 --> 00:47:57,500
Or every single woman will be scared
of you.

606
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:59,333
They don't want me anyway.

607
00:47:59,416 --> 00:48:01,375
You have to try harder.

608
00:48:02,625 --> 00:48:04,833
When I was in hospital last time,

609
00:48:05,041 --> 00:48:07,875
I met a really nice nurse there.

610
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:09,958
She was very nice.

611
00:48:12,708 --> 00:48:15,041
Do you always have to make such faces?

612
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:17,000
I'm not making faces.
I just have a face like that.

613
00:48:17,083 --> 00:48:20,666
You don't! You're a good boy,
but you glare like a killer.

614
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:24,083
No wonder that you live with me.
No one else could stand this.

615
00:48:24,166 --> 00:48:26,958
You know what?
I think I should move out.

616
00:48:27,958 --> 00:48:31,041
Come on. Why?

617
00:48:32,541 --> 00:48:35,125
Because you're really pissing me off!

618
00:48:42,666 --> 00:48:45,750
Can you explain to me
why you're so rude to me?

619
00:48:45,833 --> 00:48:49,083
Because you keep reminding me
what a loser I am.

620
00:48:50,625 --> 00:48:53,916
And will you come to dinner tomorrow?

621
00:48:54,208 --> 00:48:55,458
No, I won't.

622
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:59,041
You won't even wish me a happy birthday?

623
00:49:00,541 --> 00:49:02,791
You forgot again, didn't you?

624
00:49:04,333 --> 00:49:05,583
Okay, I'll come.

625
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:19,291
Hi.

626
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:21,208
-Hi.
-Hello.

627
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:24,333
Here's to a successful opening round of
our super game.

628
00:49:24,416 --> 00:49:25,458
Alright.

629
00:49:25,916 --> 00:49:29,041
That stripping task was
a really demented idea.

630
00:49:29,125 --> 00:49:31,375
Don't complain.
At least we're not pussies.

631
00:49:31,458 --> 00:49:32,750
So shall we start
a second round straight away?

632
00:49:32,833 --> 00:49:33,708
-Sure.
-Yeah.

633
00:49:33,791 --> 00:49:35,083
But without me.

634
00:49:35,166 --> 00:49:37,458
Come on, don't be silly,
no cold feet now.

635
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:39,666
The three of us are in,
so you should be too.

636
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:41,666
-Sorry.
-Sorry for what?

637
00:49:43,333 --> 00:49:44,875
Look, Karel…

638
00:49:46,916 --> 00:49:47,916
Cool!

639
00:49:50,416 --> 00:49:51,458
Yes?

640
00:49:52,291 --> 00:49:54,625
Hello. Can we meet?

641
00:49:54,958 --> 00:49:56,250
Do you think it's a good idea?

642
00:49:56,333 --> 00:50:00,125
No, I don't want us to continue
in what we did yesterday.

643
00:50:00,541 --> 00:50:02,666
<i>I just don't know what to do.</i>

644
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:06,208
I was about to go to the cottage,
but I've been sitting in my car

645
00:50:06,291 --> 00:50:08,583
for two hours now unable to start
the engine.

646
00:50:08,666 --> 00:50:10,500
<i>I only have time tomorrow night.</i>

647
00:50:10,583 --> 00:50:12,291
I'm filming all day.

648
00:50:12,791 --> 00:50:14,916
Write to me where you are tomorrow.
I'll come.

649
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Good. Okay. Thanks.

650
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:19,791
Bye.

651
00:50:20,375 --> 00:50:24,000
-That's perfect.
-I didn't feel like doing it though.

652
00:50:24,291 --> 00:50:28,041
-Look, your ass is completely white!
-Because I'm white.

653
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:30,208
Why are you making such tragic faces?

654
00:50:30,291 --> 00:50:32,166
I'm dealing with some shit at work.

655
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:34,083
Come on, stop lying.

656
00:50:34,333 --> 00:50:37,083
We can tell that you fucked a chick again

657
00:50:37,166 --> 00:50:39,833
and now you don't know how
to get out of it.

658
00:50:39,916 --> 00:50:41,666
Come on. Confess.

659
00:50:42,958 --> 00:50:45,375
I can't. You'd be too envious.

660
00:50:48,583 --> 00:50:50,291
Well, that's good actually.

661
00:50:50,375 --> 00:50:54,750
-What is?
-Not lying to anyone for at least a day.

662
00:50:56,458 --> 00:50:58,458
-That's a good task.
-You think?

663
00:50:58,541 --> 00:51:01,083
I really think so. Do you lie often?

664
00:51:01,375 --> 00:51:02,291
Me? To who?

665
00:51:02,375 --> 00:51:05,458
I don't know to who.
Anyone. Your mom? I don't know.

666
00:51:05,541 --> 00:51:10,416
It's funny, at high school we despised
everyone who wasn't 100% honest.

667
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:14,416
And now for many different reasons we feel
that telling the truth is bullshit.

668
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:16,916
And that lying is more reasonable.
It's weird, isn't it?

669
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,750
You mean that our balls shrink when
we don't have the guts to tell the truth?

670
00:51:20,833 --> 00:51:22,041
Exactly.

671
00:51:22,416 --> 00:51:24,583
And what rules should such a game have?

672
00:51:24,666 --> 00:51:26,416
Simple.

673
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:32,125
You just have to answer any question with
100% honesty throughout the entire day.

674
00:51:32,208 --> 00:51:33,333
No exceptions.

675
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:36,166
Whatever is anyone asking.

676
00:51:37,458 --> 00:51:40,083
And how can we prove
the fulfillment of such a task?

677
00:51:40,166 --> 00:51:44,125
We can't, this task will simply be
evaluated by ourselves.

678
00:51:44,625 --> 00:51:45,791
I agree.

679
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:47,875
-So do I.
-Great!

680
00:51:48,041 --> 00:51:50,125
Don't count on me.

681
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:53,250
If I had to be honest
with everyone all day,

682
00:51:53,333 --> 00:51:57,250
all hell would break loose
and I'd be dead by the evening.

683
00:52:05,875 --> 00:52:09,333
<i>Alone or in the crowd</i>

684
00:52:09,875 --> 00:52:13,083
<i>I can't get you off my mind</i>

685
00:52:13,916 --> 00:52:20,000
<i>I can't get you off my mind</i>
<i>I think you might know</i>

686
00:52:25,333 --> 00:52:27,458
Listen, guys,
I really learnt the whole thing.

687
00:52:27,541 --> 00:52:30,708
But if we play it so sluggishly,
I can't do it.

688
00:52:30,958 --> 00:52:34,083
We have to play it harder,
so I can get into it a bit at least.

689
00:52:34,166 --> 00:52:37,000
Or I'll feel like a total faggot.

690
00:52:37,083 --> 00:52:39,958
Alright then.
It'll be a bit different at least.

691
00:52:40,041 --> 00:52:40,916
I agree.

692
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,083
Let's get wild, dude. Cool. Let's do it.

693
00:52:48,291 --> 00:52:50,333
Get involved a bit more.

694
00:52:50,958 --> 00:52:52,333
Harder!

695
00:52:55,500 --> 00:53:01,041
<i>Alone or in the crowd</i>
<i>I can't get you off my mind</i>

696
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:07,333
<i>I can't get you off my mind</i>
<i>I think you might know</i>

697
00:53:07,416 --> 00:53:13,250
<i>I'm known for that</i>
<i>and I'm ready to forget about my fatigue</i>

698
00:53:13,458 --> 00:53:20,333
<i>Forget about my fatigue</i>
<i>and Earth's gravity</i>

699
00:53:22,916 --> 00:53:25,791
Well, that sounds better, doesn't it?

700
00:53:33,291 --> 00:53:37,583
-Alright… watch it, man!
-Sorry.

701
00:53:38,625 --> 00:53:39,958
Look.

702
00:53:40,041 --> 00:53:42,000
Now's your chance.

703
00:53:42,083 --> 00:53:44,000
-You're drooling…
-Okay…

704
00:53:47,208 --> 00:53:50,500
Listen, you know what
"reasonable“ means, right?

705
00:53:50,791 --> 00:53:54,208
Yeah, I do. No drooling, no flirting,
no banging female students.

706
00:53:54,291 --> 00:53:56,375
So remember it, man!

707
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:00,500
Listen, thanks for finding me this job.

708
00:54:01,333 --> 00:54:02,833
-Goodnight.
-Goodnight.

709
00:54:41,166 --> 00:54:43,875
Can I help you with something, Captain?

710
00:54:45,666 --> 00:54:46,666
No.

711
00:54:47,333 --> 00:54:48,375
Are you sure?

712
00:54:48,583 --> 00:54:51,083
Please. Just for a while.

713
00:54:51,875 --> 00:54:53,875
The girls are looking at me.

714
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:22,458
<i>I'm floating</i>
<i>I'm flying at supersonic speed</i>

715
00:55:22,625 --> 00:55:28,583
<i>I'm flying</i>
<i>I'm floating and I do so with joy</i>

716
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:34,541
<i>I'm floating</i>
<i>I'm flying, flight has become my quality</i>

717
00:55:34,625 --> 00:55:41,416
<i>I'm flying, I'm floating with joy</i>

718
00:56:12,375 --> 00:56:17,166
<i>Healthy. Tasty. Fragrant. That's me.</i>

719
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:22,916
<i>Traditional. Instant. Vegetable.</i>

720
00:56:30,541 --> 00:56:32,708
Could you go home please?

721
00:56:35,666 --> 00:56:37,083
Are you serious?

722
00:56:37,208 --> 00:56:38,250
Yeah.

723
00:56:46,041 --> 00:56:47,541
You're such a loser.

724
00:57:02,083 --> 00:57:03,000
Hi.

725
00:57:03,083 --> 00:57:07,333
<i>Hi, I can see you're awake.</i>
<i>Can I stop by for a while?</i>

726
00:57:09,208 --> 00:57:10,416
<i>Hello, do you hear me?</i>

727
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:11,541
Now?

728
00:57:12,083 --> 00:57:13,375
<i>What's going on?</i>

729
00:57:13,708 --> 00:57:15,791
I just don't feel like going home.

730
00:57:15,875 --> 00:57:20,791
So I'm driving around looking for a place
where I won't feel completely awful.

731
00:57:20,875 --> 00:57:22,166
Because of Klára?

732
00:57:23,958 --> 00:57:25,125
Yeah.

733
00:57:27,083 --> 00:57:29,500
<i>Ring the bell when you park the car.</i>

734
00:57:29,583 --> 00:57:30,625
Thanks.

735
00:57:51,541 --> 00:57:52,458
Yes?

736
00:57:52,541 --> 00:57:56,333
Hello, could you call me
in fifteen minutes, please?

737
00:57:56,416 --> 00:57:58,250
<i>I need to be rescued.</i>

738
00:57:58,416 --> 00:58:00,166
You know what? Go to hell.

739
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:05,250
Could you stop thinking about my appalling
character and help me? Please.

740
00:58:06,666 --> 00:58:09,708
I'm such a cow!
Why am I even talking to you?

741
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:11,958
You are very kind. Thanks!

742
00:58:20,083 --> 00:58:22,750
I might still have to go to Barrandov.

743
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:26,208
I'm shooting tomorrow and
there're some problems with decoration,

744
00:58:26,291 --> 00:58:28,500
-so I'm on the phone.
-I see.

745
00:58:32,208 --> 00:58:37,666
What would you do if you were me and
found out that Klára was cheating on you?

746
00:58:38,041 --> 00:58:40,708
I would try to forget about it.

747
00:58:42,583 --> 00:58:43,791
Forget about it?

748
00:58:45,208 --> 00:58:47,791
I'd just wipe it out of my head.

749
00:58:48,916 --> 00:58:51,416
Klára loves you. That's clear.

750
00:58:52,208 --> 00:58:54,291
It must have been a meaningless fling.

751
00:58:54,375 --> 00:58:58,500
I'm not sure if it was
a meaningless fling.

752
00:58:59,791 --> 00:59:03,833
If she didn't love you, she would have
left you ages ago.

753
00:59:03,916 --> 00:59:06,500
I know her, she can't pretend things.

754
00:59:07,916 --> 00:59:09,708
Or do you think she can?

755
00:59:11,083 --> 00:59:13,625
I'm not sure about anything anymore.

756
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:15,875
I don't know what she wants from me.

757
00:59:15,958 --> 00:59:20,291
And I don't even know what
I want from her. If anything at all.

758
00:59:21,958 --> 00:59:25,250
Just don't think you'd be better off
without her.

759
00:59:25,333 --> 00:59:27,250
Or you'll end up like me.

760
00:59:28,291 --> 00:59:30,958
You definitely won't feel any better.

761
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:39,750
So how is it going?

762
00:59:42,041 --> 00:59:43,083
Yeah.

763
00:59:48,083 --> 00:59:49,125
<i>Really?</i>

764
00:59:53,083 --> 00:59:55,083
I'll be there in a minute.

765
00:59:58,708 --> 01:00:02,208
-Sorry.
-No, it's okay. Thanks a lot.

766
01:00:02,666 --> 01:00:03,916
What for?

767
01:00:05,166 --> 01:00:08,416
Well, for example for not coming up
with a stupid excuse after

768
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:11,291
I called you in the middle of the night.

769
01:00:17,333 --> 01:00:19,375
Alright, good luck at work.

770
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:21,083
Yeah, sure, take care.

771
01:00:21,541 --> 01:00:23,333
-You too. Bye.
-Bye.

772
01:01:37,166 --> 01:01:38,166
Daddy, Daddy?

773
01:01:38,250 --> 01:01:41,625
What's going on? What's going on?
What's up?

774
01:01:41,708 --> 01:01:43,666
Come here, come here.

775
01:01:44,291 --> 01:01:47,208
Dad, you'll never die, right?

776
01:01:47,333 --> 01:01:51,125
What? Did you have a bad dream?

777
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:54,000
You're not going to die, are you?

778
01:01:55,166 --> 01:01:56,666
It's daylight already?

779
01:01:57,541 --> 01:01:58,833
Damn it.

780
01:01:58,916 --> 01:02:01,333
You're not going to die, are you?

781
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:09,750
I'm going to die,
but only after a very long time.

782
01:02:10,041 --> 01:02:11,291
But why?

783
01:02:13,208 --> 01:02:16,333
What kind of questions is that, kitty?

784
01:02:17,833 --> 01:02:19,875
Everybody has to die.

785
01:02:20,375 --> 01:02:22,166
Even mom?

786
01:02:26,458 --> 01:02:27,375
Well…

787
01:02:27,458 --> 01:02:30,916
Are you crazy? What're you telling her?

788
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:35,750
Sorry. But I have to tell
the truth all day long today. Damn it.

789
01:02:35,833 --> 01:02:38,541
What? Don't worry.

790
01:02:42,708 --> 01:02:44,916
Where are you going this early?

791
01:02:46,083 --> 01:02:47,125
To work.

792
01:02:47,833 --> 01:02:50,166
I see. And when will you come back?

793
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:52,791
At night.

794
01:02:52,958 --> 01:02:54,083
Again?

795
01:02:54,833 --> 01:02:57,291
What are you going to do all day?

796
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:02,500
Shampoo gave me a role in a commercial.

797
01:03:04,166 --> 01:03:05,208
To you?

798
01:03:06,916 --> 01:03:07,833
Yes.

799
01:03:07,916 --> 01:03:09,250
Why to you?

800
01:03:11,833 --> 01:03:16,750
I asked him if he had anything for me.

801
01:03:17,875 --> 01:03:18,916
Why?

802
01:03:20,958 --> 01:03:23,541
Because I was fired.

803
01:03:23,708 --> 01:03:24,625
What?

804
01:03:24,708 --> 01:03:26,750
Don't worry. I'll earn enough money.

805
01:03:26,833 --> 01:03:29,583
I'm shooting all day today and
then singing with the band in the evening.

806
01:03:29,666 --> 01:03:31,166
What band?

807
01:03:33,833 --> 01:03:35,666
Well, Femme Fatale.

808
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:41,458
I'll play with them at a few corporate
parties. So bye, bye and kisses.

809
01:03:50,250 --> 01:03:54,916
<i>Healthy. Tasty. Fragrant. That's me.</i>

810
01:03:55,041 --> 01:03:55,958
<i>That's me.</i>

811
01:03:56,041 --> 01:04:01,166
<i>Traditional. Instant. Vegetable.</i>

812
01:04:01,666 --> 01:04:07,208
<i>Yeah,</i>
<i>every gourmet dreams of instant soup.</i>

813
01:04:07,291 --> 01:04:10,875
<i>-Yeah, every gourmet dreams of soup.</i>
-Stop, good.

814
01:04:10,958 --> 01:04:13,791
We'll just get the details worked out.

815
01:04:14,625 --> 01:04:15,750
You're great.

816
01:04:16,208 --> 01:04:17,541
Am I not pathetic?

817
01:04:17,833 --> 01:04:21,208
Yes, you are.
But that's exactly what we need.

818
01:04:21,375 --> 01:04:23,458
Are you okay? Can I get you something?

819
01:04:23,541 --> 01:04:24,541
-No, thanks.
-Thank you.

820
01:04:24,625 --> 01:04:26,875
Girls, I need a bit more energy from you.

821
01:04:26,958 --> 01:04:29,000
Isn't that leek a bit weird?

822
01:04:29,375 --> 01:04:31,416
Well, I don't know, what do you think?

823
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:34,458
Could you smile a bit more?

824
01:04:34,541 --> 01:04:36,458
Like this, director?

825
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:39,875
Thanks.

826
01:04:41,041 --> 01:04:42,416
So, let's do it again.

827
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:47,083
<i>Healthy. Tasty. Fragrant. That's me.</i>

828
01:04:47,166 --> 01:04:48,083
<i>That's me.</i>

829
01:04:48,166 --> 01:04:52,791
<i>Traditional. Instant. Vegetable.</i>

830
01:04:53,833 --> 01:04:59,333
<i>Yeah,</i>
<i>every gourmet dreams of instant soup.</i>

831
01:04:59,458 --> 01:05:01,666
<i>Yeah, every gourmet dreams…</i>

832
01:05:01,750 --> 01:05:04,750
Can you explain to me
what the leek is doing there?

833
01:05:04,833 --> 01:05:07,541
He's looking forward to being in the soup,
just like the other vegetables.

834
01:05:07,625 --> 01:05:11,958
He's tall,
can't dance and is a bit dangly.

835
01:05:12,041 --> 01:05:13,958
You wanted a commercial with humor,
didn't you?

836
01:05:14,041 --> 01:05:15,500
Tell the man to ease back.

837
01:05:15,583 --> 01:05:17,750
-It'll be fine. Trust me.
-Tell him to slow down!

838
01:05:17,833 --> 01:05:23,250
<i>Yeah,</i>
<i>every gourmet dreams of instant soup.</i>

839
01:05:23,458 --> 01:05:27,333
<i>-Yeah, every gourmet dreams of soup.</i>
<i>-Stop!</i>

840
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:31,916
The leek should slow down a bit, please!
Make it a bit more subtle, okay?

841
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,708
But you wanted to make it funny.

842
01:05:34,833 --> 01:05:37,375
Is it possible to slow down a little?

843
01:05:37,458 --> 01:05:39,833
Sure. As you wish.

844
01:05:40,208 --> 01:05:41,708
Okay, one more time.

845
01:06:05,541 --> 01:06:10,000
Good morning. Your coffee. Are you okay?

846
01:06:10,083 --> 01:06:13,041
Not really. Why are they clapping?

847
01:06:13,208 --> 01:06:16,166
We're all glad that you didn't sell
the company.

848
01:06:16,250 --> 01:06:17,250
That's great.

849
01:06:18,083 --> 01:06:20,541
Well, apart from Max, actually.

850
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,083
Sure.

851
01:06:39,083 --> 01:06:40,541
What are you doing?

852
01:06:41,750 --> 01:06:44,750
The Americans backed out.
I had to get it out of my system.

853
01:06:44,833 --> 01:06:46,791
Yeah, sure. Take it easy.

854
01:06:48,208 --> 01:06:50,083
-What?
-What the fuck is pissing you off?

855
01:06:50,166 --> 01:06:52,000
That you won't make more millions?

856
01:06:52,083 --> 01:06:55,708
You have enough money already.
Why do you need more?

857
01:07:00,166 --> 01:07:02,125
You're acting like an irresponsible dick.

858
01:07:02,208 --> 01:07:07,333
And I feel better like this. When my head
isn't controlled by a calculator.

859
01:07:08,666 --> 01:07:11,625
I'm sorry, but…
the TV people have just arrived.

860
01:07:11,708 --> 01:07:14,166
Should they wait in the boardroom?

861
01:07:14,666 --> 01:07:15,750
You mean for me?

862
01:07:15,833 --> 01:07:18,166
Yeah. You promised an interview.

863
01:07:18,833 --> 01:07:20,583
But I don't want to do any interviews
right now.

864
01:07:20,666 --> 01:07:26,041
Don't be cross, but yesterday you said
you wouldn't send them away if they came.

865
01:07:26,125 --> 01:07:28,416
-Did I really say that?
-Yeah.

866
01:07:29,916 --> 01:07:33,250
Alright then. So let's do an interview.

867
01:07:34,833 --> 01:07:36,208
Please…

868
01:07:36,666 --> 01:07:41,041
May I ask you to be nice
and polite during the interview?

869
01:07:41,125 --> 01:07:45,000
At least smile a little and don't cause
even more problems with your…

870
01:07:45,083 --> 01:07:46,166
new feelings?

871
01:07:46,291 --> 01:07:48,541
-Can you try that?
-Yeah.

872
01:07:48,791 --> 01:07:52,041
-I can try that.
-Thanks.

873
01:07:54,750 --> 01:07:58,541
Wouldn't a suit be more suitable
for the interview?

874
01:07:59,708 --> 01:08:01,750
I'll tell them you'll be there
in a minute.

875
01:08:01,833 --> 01:08:02,958
Okay.

876
01:08:15,750 --> 01:08:16,791
Hi.

877
01:08:16,875 --> 01:08:19,166
<i>Hello, listen, I wanted to ask you,</i>

878
01:08:19,250 --> 01:08:20,875
are we still…

879
01:08:21,916 --> 01:08:23,582
What are you doing there,
are you fucking?

880
01:08:23,666 --> 01:08:24,707
Yeah.

881
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,041
Really?

882
01:08:27,582 --> 01:08:28,625
No.

883
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
<i>So what are you doing there?</i>

884
01:08:31,082 --> 01:08:33,625
I'm preparing my sperm for a lab analysis.

885
01:08:33,707 --> 01:08:35,541
Dude, that's perfect.

886
01:08:36,541 --> 01:08:39,375
It means that I have to tell
the truth as well, right?

887
01:08:39,457 --> 01:08:42,500
Well, you don't have to.
If you don't mind being a loser.

888
01:08:42,582 --> 01:08:43,416
<i>Cool.</i>

889
01:08:44,125 --> 01:08:45,832
Thanks. Have a nice day.

890
01:08:47,916 --> 01:08:49,082
You too.

891
01:08:55,250 --> 01:08:56,207
Shall we?

892
01:08:56,291 --> 01:08:57,582
Yeah, I'm rolling!

893
01:08:57,666 --> 01:09:01,291
Is it true that IT companies offer
customers "perfect innovations“

894
01:09:01,375 --> 01:09:03,832
which are in fact
technologically obsolete products?

895
01:09:03,916 --> 01:09:06,750
Does your company do that as well?

896
01:09:07,625 --> 01:09:08,707
Yes.

897
01:09:08,916 --> 01:09:10,707
So you admit it.

898
01:09:11,250 --> 01:09:12,250
Yes.

899
01:09:12,625 --> 01:09:15,832
Can you explain to our viewers
how it works?

900
01:09:16,832 --> 01:09:20,582
If we want to make the customer
buy a new program every year,

901
01:09:20,666 --> 01:09:24,207
we must present
the offered products as bulletproof

902
01:09:24,291 --> 01:09:27,541
and at the same time finalize the
development of their improved versions.

903
01:09:27,625 --> 01:09:30,375
There has been recent speculation
in the media

904
01:09:30,457 --> 01:09:35,207
that your company intentionally generates
viruses that infect your own programs.

905
01:09:35,291 --> 01:09:36,291
Is it true?

906
01:09:38,416 --> 01:09:39,457
It is.

907
01:09:39,707 --> 01:09:40,875
And what's the point in that?

908
01:09:40,957 --> 01:09:44,916
The point is that we increase the demand
for our antivirus products.

909
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,666
Doesn't that seem
a little unethical to you?

910
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:51,457
The main purpose of every company's
existence is to generate profit.

911
01:09:51,541 --> 01:09:55,625
Everything else is just a marketing
fairytale to make the customer spend

912
01:09:55,708 --> 01:09:57,875
as much money as possible.

913
01:09:58,458 --> 01:10:00,333
We're real bastards, aren't we?

914
01:10:01,375 --> 01:10:03,958
Hop, hop, hop, okay.

915
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,958
Wider, come on.

916
01:10:12,125 --> 01:10:14,250
Now. That's it.

917
01:10:27,208 --> 01:10:28,291
Is that clear?

918
01:10:29,666 --> 01:10:30,916
Now you.

919
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:31,916
Holy smoke.

920
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,500
Is there anything you can't do, Captain?

921
01:10:34,583 --> 01:10:37,041
That's a question I'm supposed to answer,
right?

922
01:10:37,125 --> 01:10:38,125
Yeah. Sure.

923
01:10:42,083 --> 01:10:44,125
I can't do it with girls.

924
01:10:44,375 --> 01:10:46,500
What can't you do with girls?

925
01:10:47,458 --> 01:10:48,458
Anything.

926
01:10:48,541 --> 01:10:50,458
What do you mean by that?

927
01:10:50,541 --> 01:10:51,958
Everything.

928
01:10:52,083 --> 01:10:53,333
And why?

929
01:10:53,875 --> 01:10:55,291
Because…

930
01:10:56,958 --> 01:10:58,666
I'm a lout.

931
01:11:01,750 --> 01:11:03,541
What's funny about that?

932
01:11:07,125 --> 01:11:12,166
<i>In instant soup, yeah, yeah</i>

933
01:11:12,291 --> 01:11:13,416
Stop!

934
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:18,916
MISS VITAMIN

935
01:11:19,041 --> 01:11:21,583
Can you tell me what you're doing?

936
01:11:21,666 --> 01:11:23,791
-Nothing now.
-Show me.

937
01:11:25,291 --> 01:11:26,875
Director.

938
01:11:27,250 --> 01:11:31,416
I don't want an allergy sufferer to act
in a healthy soup commercial.

939
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:32,500
What?

940
01:11:32,708 --> 01:11:34,708
This man is allergic to makeup.

941
01:11:34,791 --> 01:11:37,083
It's okay. I can handle it.

942
01:11:37,333 --> 01:11:39,250
-We can keep shooting.
-Yeah.

943
01:11:39,375 --> 01:11:42,125
Yeah? You have eyes like an Angora rabbit!

944
01:11:42,208 --> 01:11:44,208
We can move him to the back.

945
01:11:44,333 --> 01:11:46,208
Are you kidding?

946
01:11:46,375 --> 01:11:48,791
Replace this Dracula, immediately.

947
01:11:48,958 --> 01:11:53,375
Wait. I've been fooling around here since
morning,

948
01:11:53,458 --> 01:11:55,958
so I'll only leave when I get paid.

949
01:11:56,083 --> 01:11:59,083
Based on the contract
you should actually pay a fine

950
01:11:59,166 --> 01:12:01,875
for concealing your allergy
and delaying the shooting.

951
01:12:01,958 --> 01:12:05,750
So shut up,
take off the costume and piss off!

952
01:12:05,833 --> 01:12:09,583
-Stop yelling at me.
-Can you fire the idiot?

953
01:12:10,875 --> 01:12:13,666
Hey, be reasonable.
I'll give you the money myself.

954
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:18,791
I don't want your money.
I want that arrogant prick's money.

955
01:12:18,875 --> 01:12:20,291
Stop it. Stop it.

956
01:12:21,125 --> 01:12:24,625
Why don't I remember this actor
from the casting, director?

957
01:12:24,708 --> 01:12:26,791
Did you cast a role in a commercial which

958
01:12:26,875 --> 01:12:29,291
our company pays
for without my permission?

959
01:12:29,375 --> 01:12:32,916
A role for your friend
without my approval?

960
01:12:33,041 --> 01:12:36,833
Or am I wrong? He is not your friend?

961
01:12:38,708 --> 01:12:43,916
No, he's not.
He's tall, so he was good for the role.

962
01:12:44,291 --> 01:12:48,208
But of course, if you wish,
I can recast him.

963
01:12:48,875 --> 01:12:50,083
Perfect.

964
01:12:51,416 --> 01:12:54,041
You're acting like a douchebag.

965
01:12:55,541 --> 01:13:00,708
You should try to muster the courage
and start telling the truth

966
01:13:00,791 --> 01:13:03,625
for at least one day of your life.

967
01:13:10,208 --> 01:13:13,500
Wait, wait. Are you okay?

968
01:13:13,583 --> 01:13:16,958
Don't touch me, don't touch me.

969
01:13:17,041 --> 01:13:18,500
Somebody help!

970
01:13:18,583 --> 01:13:21,791
Get me out of this. Get me out!

971
01:13:27,833 --> 01:13:28,750
Hello.

972
01:13:28,833 --> 01:13:33,958
I'm sorry, but could you possibly find out
where Klára's car is now?

973
01:13:34,041 --> 01:13:37,083
It has a registered satellite
search option.

974
01:13:37,166 --> 01:13:39,208
Why don't you just call her?

975
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:42,541
I don't want her to know
I'm looking for her.

976
01:13:42,625 --> 01:13:46,125
I was hoping she went to the cottage,
but she didn't.

977
01:13:46,208 --> 01:13:47,333
I was there last night.

978
01:13:47,416 --> 01:13:49,166
You went to the Giant Mountains
to see her?

979
01:13:49,250 --> 01:13:50,291
<i>Yeah.</i>

980
01:13:50,833 --> 01:13:52,333
Can you help me?

981
01:13:52,625 --> 01:13:55,041
I just need to know where she is.

982
01:13:55,625 --> 01:13:57,833
Send me the license plate number.

983
01:13:58,916 --> 01:13:59,958
Thanks.

984
01:14:00,333 --> 01:14:01,375
<i>Bye.</i>

985
01:14:04,333 --> 01:14:05,333
Bon appetite.

986
01:14:06,333 --> 01:14:08,750
Those bitches put carrot in there again,
man.

987
01:14:08,833 --> 01:14:10,375
They always put it there, don't they?

988
01:14:10,458 --> 01:14:12,041
And peas as well, man.

989
01:14:12,333 --> 01:14:13,833
You're such a loser.

990
01:15:10,833 --> 01:15:15,166
Good morning. Can I help you?
What size is your wife?

991
01:15:15,708 --> 01:15:17,166
I don't know.

992
01:15:20,375 --> 01:15:23,000
Where are the fitting rooms?

993
01:15:24,125 --> 01:15:25,250
Over there.

994
01:15:38,958 --> 01:15:41,333
Damn it!

995
01:15:50,958 --> 01:15:52,041
Sir?

996
01:15:59,666 --> 01:16:01,750
This is the women's department.

997
01:16:01,833 --> 01:16:03,041
I know.

998
01:16:03,333 --> 01:16:04,500
Almost finished.

999
01:16:08,708 --> 01:16:09,791
Cash registers?

1000
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:56,416
Hello.

1001
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:59,166
I've found it. Thanks for your help.

1002
01:16:59,250 --> 01:17:00,375
<i>No problem.</i>

1003
01:17:00,458 --> 01:17:02,583
You're not going to do anything stupid,
are you?

1004
01:17:02,666 --> 01:17:03,916
<i>No, don't worry.</i>

1005
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,041
Bye.

1006
01:17:26,041 --> 01:17:27,958
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

1007
01:17:28,041 --> 01:17:31,791
I'm sorry, but could you tell me
if she's staying here?

1008
01:17:32,250 --> 01:17:33,666
Are you from the police?

1009
01:17:33,750 --> 01:17:35,750
No. She's my wife.

1010
01:17:36,166 --> 01:17:41,750
Sorry, but I can't give any information
about our guests.

1011
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Sure.

1012
01:17:53,333 --> 01:17:55,083
Yes, she's staying here.

1013
01:17:57,416 --> 01:17:58,458
Alone?

1014
01:17:59,041 --> 01:18:00,166
Yeah.

1015
01:18:01,041 --> 01:18:02,958
And did she have a visitor?

1016
01:18:03,875 --> 01:18:06,625
No. She left a while ago.

1017
01:18:32,083 --> 01:18:36,041
If you haven't heard it yet, the party is
at Cobra Bar starting at half past eight.

1018
01:18:36,125 --> 01:18:37,208
Great, perfect.

1019
01:18:37,291 --> 01:18:40,833
Looking forward to seeing you there.
Oh, I'm sorry.

1020
01:18:48,708 --> 01:18:49,791
So?

1021
01:18:50,833 --> 01:18:54,000
It worked out quite well in the end,
didn't it?

1022
01:18:55,291 --> 01:18:56,333
What is it?

1023
01:18:56,625 --> 01:19:00,083
Feel free to tell me the truth,
I can handle it.

1024
01:19:02,666 --> 01:19:04,125
It's shit.

1025
01:19:07,666 --> 01:19:08,583
What?

1026
01:19:08,666 --> 01:19:10,583
It's shit.

1027
01:19:12,291 --> 01:19:13,916
If you think so.

1028
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,375
<i>If you still haven’t returned</i>
<i>the walkie-talkies to the production,</i>

1029
01:19:16,458 --> 01:19:18,625
<i>please do it now.</i>

1030
01:19:20,666 --> 01:19:23,083
That was great!

1031
01:19:23,791 --> 01:19:26,458
You deserve a kiss for this, cowboy.

1032
01:19:28,708 --> 01:19:31,666
Would you like to snuggle up to me
in my bed today?

1033
01:19:31,750 --> 01:19:34,833
I wouldn't. And don't touch me.

1034
01:19:37,708 --> 01:19:42,458
Why do you have to act like
an unbearable idiot so often?

1035
01:20:23,208 --> 01:20:28,291
Don't shoot me… yeah… wait…

1036
01:20:28,583 --> 01:20:30,291
Grandma!

1037
01:20:39,375 --> 01:20:44,083
Yeah. Perfect hit. I'm dead.

1038
01:20:45,375 --> 01:20:48,416
Mom. There's a gentleman here.

1039
01:20:48,583 --> 01:20:49,625
Who?

1040
01:20:52,625 --> 01:20:53,666
Hello.

1041
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,041
Hello.

1042
01:20:56,083 --> 01:20:57,375
Who is he?

1043
01:21:10,416 --> 01:21:13,666
Do you remember how we talked about Daddy
the other day?

1044
01:21:13,750 --> 01:21:15,083
Is that him?

1045
01:21:19,416 --> 01:21:20,458
Hello.

1046
01:21:36,083 --> 01:21:39,541
Why don't you live with us if you're
my dad?

1047
01:21:42,791 --> 01:21:44,875
Why did you leave us?

1048
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:47,541
I was scared.

1049
01:21:48,750 --> 01:21:49,916
Of what?

1050
01:21:52,166 --> 01:21:56,958
That I'll have to stay with you forever.

1051
01:21:57,833 --> 01:22:00,166
And why were you afraid of that?

1052
01:22:07,791 --> 01:22:10,583
Because I wasn't sure if
I really wanted to.

1053
01:22:10,666 --> 01:22:12,375
So do you want to or not?

1054
01:22:21,375 --> 01:22:23,208
I still don't know.

1055
01:23:06,541 --> 01:23:07,875
Peter.

1056
01:23:09,958 --> 01:23:10,958
Peter.

1057
01:23:11,041 --> 01:23:11,958
Oh, hello.

1058
01:23:12,041 --> 01:23:13,541
-Hi. Hi, Mom.
-Hi.

1059
01:23:13,833 --> 01:23:15,750
So I wish you all the best.

1060
01:23:15,833 --> 01:23:19,958
And also some nice shows on TV
that you can finally enjoy watching.

1061
01:23:20,041 --> 01:23:23,291
And this is something nice to smoke.

1062
01:23:23,375 --> 01:23:27,291
Oh, thank you, my boy.

1063
01:23:28,875 --> 01:23:30,625
What is that lovely smell?

1064
01:23:30,708 --> 01:23:32,083
We have a visitor.

1065
01:23:37,083 --> 01:23:38,083
Good evening.

1066
01:23:41,750 --> 01:23:44,666
I've told you a hundred times.
Stop trying to find me a woman!

1067
01:23:44,750 --> 01:23:47,750
But this is Irenka, she's really nice.

1068
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:51,208
She's the nurse I told you about!

1069
01:23:51,291 --> 01:23:54,708
She's looking for a place to stay,
so she'll live here with me now.

1070
01:23:54,791 --> 01:23:55,708
What?

1071
01:23:55,791 --> 01:23:57,875
She's come to help me with cooking.

1072
01:23:57,958 --> 01:24:00,708
Don't you think you should have asked
me first?

1073
01:24:00,791 --> 01:24:04,458
And did you ask me when
you decided to move out?

1074
01:24:08,500 --> 01:24:11,958
I just want to say that the turkey will be
ready in five minutes,

1075
01:24:12,041 --> 01:24:13,291
so I should probably go.

1076
01:24:13,375 --> 01:24:20,791
No way! It's my birthday today and I want
to have dinner with both of you.

1077
01:24:30,541 --> 01:24:34,375
How was your day today?

1078
01:24:36,708 --> 01:24:38,458
Nothing interesting happened.

1079
01:24:38,541 --> 01:24:43,791
Come on! Irenka might be interested too.
Right?

1080
01:24:44,041 --> 01:24:48,166
Of course. I hear you teach martial arts.

1081
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:52,166
When I was little, I did judo.

1082
01:24:52,458 --> 01:24:53,666
I see.

1083
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:57,500
Can't you just simply tell us
what you did today?

1084
01:24:57,750 --> 01:24:59,666
I don't even know how you live.

1085
01:24:59,750 --> 01:25:01,916
Mom, please, I don't really want to.

1086
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:05,000
Can't you push yourself a bit today?

1087
01:25:05,083 --> 01:25:06,583
At least a little.

1088
01:25:09,291 --> 01:25:10,375
Okay.

1089
01:25:13,083 --> 01:25:17,291
I masturbated in the morning
in order to deliver a semen sample.

1090
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:21,125
Around noon
I was drooling like a real loser

1091
01:25:21,208 --> 01:25:24,291
while looking at my students' breasts
at the punching bags.

1092
01:25:24,416 --> 01:25:27,000
Later I felt really ashamed
at my urology appointment,

1093
01:25:27,083 --> 01:25:31,583
as during my last visit I unsuccessfully
invited the urologist on a date,

1094
01:25:31,666 --> 01:25:34,541
right after she stuck her finger
in my ass.

1095
01:25:35,041 --> 01:25:39,666
And before I came here, I fell asleep
for a while and had a dream

1096
01:25:39,750 --> 01:25:43,166
about you and me on vacation
somewhere by the sea.

1097
01:25:43,583 --> 01:25:45,708
So this has been my whole day.

1098
01:25:46,083 --> 01:25:50,583
But the dream was really nice, wasn't it?

1099
01:25:51,291 --> 01:25:56,375
There's nothing more desperate
than when a 45-year-old son dreams about

1100
01:25:56,541 --> 01:25:59,541
his own mother putting
sunscreen on his back.

1101
01:25:59,625 --> 01:26:02,958
It was a shitty dream, Mom.

1102
01:26:03,041 --> 01:26:05,375
Like everything else that happened
to me today.

1103
01:26:05,458 --> 01:26:06,875
Are you satisfied?

1104
01:26:09,333 --> 01:26:11,166
-I also had a dream.
-Yes?

1105
01:26:11,250 --> 01:26:16,083
I dreamed I was so fat that
I wouldn't fit in the tram.

1106
01:26:16,166 --> 01:26:19,833
I blocked the door with my bottom.

1107
01:26:21,458 --> 01:26:26,291
And I was riding like that around
Prague until the driver pulled me

1108
01:26:26,375 --> 01:26:31,541
out at Pankrác depot.

1109
01:26:33,666 --> 01:26:37,541
Your effort is pointless.
I won't invite you on a date.

1110
01:26:38,833 --> 01:26:40,916
From the first moment
it is very clear to me

1111
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,500
that you are as desperate as I am.

1112
01:26:54,083 --> 01:26:57,458
Go after her at once and apologize.

1113
01:26:57,583 --> 01:26:59,083
Do you have tachycardia?

1114
01:26:59,166 --> 01:27:00,125
Go to her.

1115
01:27:00,208 --> 01:27:01,500
-Should I call an ambulance?
-No.

1116
01:27:01,583 --> 01:27:02,500
Are you sure?

1117
01:27:02,583 --> 01:27:08,041
I'm sure I'll feel better if you go
and apologize.

1118
01:27:08,291 --> 01:27:12,916
Stop pretending you're dying.
You can only blame yourself for this.

1119
01:27:28,791 --> 01:27:30,083
Enjoy your meal.

1120
01:28:13,833 --> 01:28:17,125
Good evening.
Has my wife come back yet?

1121
01:28:18,333 --> 01:28:20,791
Can you tell me her room number?

1122
01:28:21,166 --> 01:28:22,666
She has a visitor.

1123
01:28:24,625 --> 01:28:25,708
Who?

1124
01:28:26,375 --> 01:28:29,041
A 45-year-old man, I'd say.

1125
01:28:29,208 --> 01:28:31,291
-He came a while ago.
-The room number?

1126
01:28:31,375 --> 01:28:32,458
I don't want to have any problems.

1127
01:28:32,541 --> 01:28:35,375
If you don't tell me the number,
I'll start banging on all doors.

1128
01:28:35,458 --> 01:28:40,500
Sooner or later, I'll find out which room
it is. Very soon, in fact.

1129
01:28:40,708 --> 01:28:43,083
-Three hundred and two.
-Thank you.

1130
01:28:47,625 --> 01:28:49,666
Everything I do is wrong.

1131
01:28:50,125 --> 01:28:52,208
Matthew will never forgive me.

1132
01:28:53,333 --> 01:28:55,916
Should I say something to you or not?

1133
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:58,666
You should make peace with Karel.

1134
01:28:58,750 --> 01:29:00,583
I'll blame myself forever otherwise.

1135
01:29:00,666 --> 01:29:02,666
What do you think I should do?

1136
01:29:02,750 --> 01:29:06,000
I don't even know if Karel
wants me to come back home.

1137
01:29:06,083 --> 01:29:07,833
He didn't even call me.

1138
01:29:12,833 --> 01:29:15,166
Don't worry, he'll find you.

1139
01:29:18,833 --> 01:29:19,875
<i>Klára.</i>

1140
01:29:28,375 --> 01:29:29,416
Yes?

1141
01:29:46,125 --> 01:29:47,208
Can I enter?

1142
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:05,583
Are you alone?

1143
01:30:06,541 --> 01:30:07,583
Yeah.

1144
01:30:10,458 --> 01:30:12,750
I thought you wanted to go somewhere.

1145
01:30:12,833 --> 01:30:14,750
Well, I didn't go anywhere.

1146
01:30:17,291 --> 01:30:18,708
I'm looking for you.

1147
01:30:18,958 --> 01:30:20,000
Yeah?

1148
01:30:20,833 --> 01:30:21,875
Yeah.

1149
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,833
You know,
I wanted to tell you that I love you.

1150
01:30:25,916 --> 01:30:29,250
That I never cared about anyone as much as
I care about you.

1151
01:30:29,333 --> 01:30:31,291
But I'm really sorry about this.

1152
01:30:31,375 --> 01:30:34,166
-Sorry about what?
-That you're lying to me.

1153
01:30:34,250 --> 01:30:35,291
Oh.

1154
01:30:35,458 --> 01:30:38,208
-Who do you have here?
-Karel, wait!

1155
01:30:38,458 --> 01:30:39,958
-Is he in there? In the bathroom?
-No. No.

1156
01:30:40,041 --> 01:30:43,541
No, no, no.
Wait a minute. Karel, Karel, please.

1157
01:30:43,625 --> 01:30:44,791
<i>-Stop it!</i>
<i>-Show yourself!</i>

1158
01:30:44,875 --> 01:30:46,458
<i>Karel! Karel! Stop it! Stop it!</i>

1159
01:30:46,541 --> 01:30:47,458
Wait!

1160
01:30:47,541 --> 01:30:49,875
Is it okay now? Am I showing enough
emotions to your satisfaction?

1161
01:30:49,958 --> 01:30:50,958
Calm down.

1162
01:30:51,083 --> 01:30:52,750
-Come on, show yourself!
-I know what it looks like, but…

1163
01:30:52,833 --> 01:30:53,750
It looks really stupid!

1164
01:30:53,833 --> 01:30:57,458
We were just talking.
I can explain it to you, Karel.

1165
01:31:00,375 --> 01:31:02,541
Just stay calm!

1166
01:31:03,291 --> 01:31:05,041
It's not what you think.

1167
01:31:06,791 --> 01:31:10,833
You're supposed to be my friend
and not hide in the bathroom.

1168
01:31:10,916 --> 01:31:12,750
But I am your friend.

1169
01:31:14,625 --> 01:31:15,833
No, you are not.

1170
01:31:17,416 --> 01:31:19,791
-Karel, please.
-Don't touch me!

1171
01:31:24,083 --> 01:31:25,125
Karel…

1172
01:32:06,083 --> 01:32:07,583
CONCERTS

1173
01:32:16,875 --> 01:32:20,958
You're an angel, Mrs. Hrdličková!
They are all asleep.

1174
01:32:21,333 --> 01:32:23,416
If anything happens, call me.

1175
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:26,958
Don't worry.
Just enjoy your evening with your husband.

1176
01:32:27,041 --> 01:32:28,916
Well, thank you.

1177
01:32:49,708 --> 01:32:55,250
<i>Then look where there</i>
<i>is no earthly gravity</i>

1178
01:32:57,041 --> 01:33:02,958
<i>Stay down for now, I'm a woman</i>

1179
01:33:03,750 --> 01:33:06,833
<i>I am a woman</i>

1180
01:33:07,541 --> 01:33:14,666
<i>A long white glowing comet sweeps</i>
<i>the Milky Way in the distance</i>

1181
01:33:14,833 --> 01:33:20,625
<i>However, my heat is much closer</i>

1182
01:33:22,208 --> 01:33:25,541
<i>A long white glowing comet</i>

1183
01:33:25,666 --> 01:33:29,291
<i>It may be a century-old lady</i>

1184
01:33:29,541 --> 01:33:35,541
<i>But I'm younger, twenty and a couple…</i>

1185
01:33:47,250 --> 01:33:49,291
<i>Tell me</i>

1186
01:33:50,375 --> 01:33:52,916
<i>On behalf of all flowers</i>

1187
01:33:53,083 --> 01:33:54,291
<i>Tell me</i>

1188
01:33:55,208 --> 01:33:57,875
<i>More beautifully than ever before</i>

1189
01:33:58,250 --> 01:33:59,416
<i>tell me…</i>

1190
01:33:59,708 --> 01:34:01,291
I'm totally crazy about him,
he's gorgeous!

1191
01:34:01,375 --> 01:34:03,333
<i>Honey, I love you</i>

1192
01:34:03,416 --> 01:34:04,750
Do you think he's gay?!

1193
01:34:04,833 --> 01:34:07,250
Of course he is, just look at him.

1194
01:34:07,625 --> 01:34:10,916
<i>My head sounds like a beehive</i>

1195
01:34:11,583 --> 01:34:17,416

1196
01:34:19,208 --> 01:34:22,833
<i>Your words smell so nice</i>

1197
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:52,625
Great!

1198
01:34:56,458 --> 01:34:58,375
<i>…long, black and white…</i>

1199
01:35:03,333 --> 01:35:04,708
That was just great!

1200
01:35:04,791 --> 01:35:06,458
I knew it.

1201
01:35:06,541 --> 01:35:08,375
-You have to sing with us all the time.
-Sure.

1202
01:35:08,458 --> 01:35:10,416
We'll have so many gigs!

1203
01:35:10,791 --> 01:35:12,500
-Wait a minute.
-Give me five.

1204
01:35:12,583 --> 01:35:14,916
-Hop, hop. Give me five.
-Wait.

1205
01:35:15,083 --> 01:35:16,166
What's up?

1206
01:35:17,583 --> 01:35:18,833
He's amazing!

1207
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:20,708
What are you doing here?

1208
01:35:22,458 --> 01:35:24,416
Who's babysitting the girls?

1209
01:35:24,500 --> 01:35:26,083
What are you doing here?

1210
01:35:26,166 --> 01:35:30,166
What do you think? I'm singing.
I told you in the morning.

1211
01:35:30,458 --> 01:35:32,166
And you like it?

1212
01:35:32,458 --> 01:35:34,041
I don't like it.

1213
01:35:35,458 --> 01:35:39,833
Or maybe I do. I don't know.
I have to earn money somehow.

1214
01:35:40,166 --> 01:35:41,583
Why did you come?

1215
01:35:41,666 --> 01:35:45,125
I saw you buying this dress
in the afternoon.

1216
01:35:45,333 --> 01:35:46,458
What?

1217
01:35:47,083 --> 01:35:49,125
Does it make you feel good?

1218
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:52,333
-What the hell are you talking about?
-How long have you been lying to me?

1219
01:35:52,416 --> 01:35:54,166
I don't lie to you.

1220
01:35:56,083 --> 01:36:00,958
Or maybe I do, because you're pregnant
and you're stressed about everything.

1221
01:36:01,041 --> 01:36:04,625
Stressed? You're acting so weird.

1222
01:36:04,708 --> 01:36:06,166
And how should I act?

1223
01:36:06,458 --> 01:36:09,666
You're fulfilling your dream about having
a big family

1224
01:36:09,750 --> 01:36:12,208
with the fourth girl in your belly.
And I'm just trying to survive.

1225
01:36:12,291 --> 01:36:14,916
So stop looking at me so reproachfully.

1226
01:36:16,041 --> 01:36:17,125
Oh man.

1227
01:36:17,416 --> 01:36:20,833
-Let's give them an encore.
-Yeah, I'm coming.

1228
01:36:21,291 --> 01:36:22,375
You know what?

1229
01:36:23,166 --> 01:36:28,416
Wait for me here, sit down.
Two more songs and then we go home.

1230
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:40,833
What are you doing there, Captain?

1231
01:37:45,708 --> 01:37:47,583
I'm looking at boobs,
but they're not really visible.

1232
01:37:47,666 --> 01:37:50,000
No girl will sleep with you
if you act like this, Captain.

1233
01:37:50,083 --> 01:37:51,500
Go!

1234
01:37:51,625 --> 01:37:55,458
Okay. Goodnight. Sorry, Captain.

1235
01:38:10,666 --> 01:38:13,958
Excuse me, have you seen my pregnant wife
somewhere around here by any chance?

1236
01:38:14,041 --> 01:38:16,666
An ambulance came for a pregnant woman
a while ago.

1237
01:38:16,750 --> 01:38:17,541
What?

1238
01:38:17,625 --> 01:38:18,458
And when exactly?

1239
01:38:18,541 --> 01:38:23,708
About five minutes ago.
Sorry, I have to go to the bar.

1240
01:38:31,958 --> 01:38:35,041
Shit. Shit!

1241
01:38:47,958 --> 01:38:51,875
Ľubica! Ľubica…

1242
01:38:51,958 --> 01:38:54,541
MATERNITY WARD

1243
01:38:55,625 --> 01:38:56,541
Ľubica.

1244
01:38:56,625 --> 01:38:57,833
-Are you the father?
-Yeah.

1245
01:38:57,916 --> 01:38:59,333
Just wait here!

1246
01:38:59,416 --> 01:39:00,500
What's up? Are you okay?

1247
01:39:00,583 --> 01:39:02,291
-Wait here. Calm down. Let's go.
-Yeah.

1248
01:39:02,375 --> 01:39:04,958
-I'll talk to you later.
-Ľubica.

1249
01:39:37,541 --> 01:39:39,041
<i>Hi, Dad.</i>

1250
01:39:40,791 --> 01:39:42,916
<i>Why did you leave us?</i>

1251
01:40:05,250 --> 01:40:06,250
Yeah?

1252
01:40:06,333 --> 01:40:09,166
Where the hell are you?
We have to start rolling in a moment.

1253
01:40:09,250 --> 01:40:11,208
I'm really sorry.

1254
01:40:11,291 --> 01:40:12,666
I won't come today.

1255
01:40:13,375 --> 01:40:14,291
Sorry.

1256
01:40:14,375 --> 01:40:15,791
<i>Wait!</i>

1257
01:40:41,833 --> 01:40:46,208
Wait, wait, stop it.
Stop it, Ema, someone's calling me. Wait.

1258
01:40:46,833 --> 01:40:47,833
Yes?

1259
01:40:48,041 --> 01:40:50,125
I'm announcing
the third round of the game.

1260
01:40:50,208 --> 01:40:52,041
We all have to do what we fear the most.

1261
01:40:52,125 --> 01:40:55,166
What? Stop it! Girls, stop it!

1262
01:40:55,250 --> 01:40:58,333
You have to do what you know is right,

1263
01:40:58,416 --> 01:41:00,166
but you're afraid of it.

1264
01:41:01,041 --> 01:41:02,208
That's a good third task, isn't it?

1265
01:41:02,291 --> 01:41:04,750
You know what? I don't have time
for your smart ideas right now.

1266
01:41:04,833 --> 01:41:06,500
Ľubica almost miscarried last night.

1267
01:41:06,583 --> 01:41:10,333
She'll stay in hospital until
she gives birth and I'm totally fucked.

1268
01:41:10,416 --> 01:41:13,875
So confide in someone else, alright?
Sorry. Sorry.

1269
01:41:13,958 --> 01:41:16,416
Come on, girls, we have to hurry.

1270
01:42:05,833 --> 01:42:09,166
<i>And this song goes to everyone</i>
<i>who is affected,</i>

1271
01:42:09,250 --> 01:42:12,791
<i>just like all of us here,</i>
<i>by today's tragic death of</i>

1272
01:42:12,875 --> 01:42:15,250
<i>the director of our favorite TV series.</i>

1273
01:42:15,333 --> 01:42:17,416
<i>We are the Stars.</i>

1274
01:42:40,666 --> 01:42:43,625
<i>Who doesn't hop,</i>
<i>isn't Czech! Hop, hop, hop!</i>

1275
01:42:43,708 --> 01:42:46,583
<i>Who doesn't hop,</i>
<i>isn't Czech! Hop, hop, hop!</i>

1276
01:42:46,666 --> 01:42:49,791
<i>Who doesn't hop,</i>
<i>isn't Czech! Hop, hop, hop!</i>

1277
01:43:04,750 --> 01:43:07,750
<i>Full Stop, buddy, happy New Year!</i>

1278
01:43:07,833 --> 01:43:09,291
<i>May you</i>

1279
01:43:09,541 --> 01:43:12,333
<i>avoid all bullets on your mission</i>

1280
01:43:12,416 --> 01:43:16,291
<i>and may your balls be shaken by</i>
<i>pretty female soldiers.</i>

1281
01:43:16,541 --> 01:43:20,875
<i>And I hope that when you come back</i>
<i>you'll find a woman,</i>

1282
01:43:21,250 --> 01:43:25,291
<i>stay here and go for drinks.</i>

1283
01:43:25,375 --> 01:43:27,625
<i>Think about it, buddy.</i>

1284
01:43:27,833 --> 01:43:28,875
<i>Bye.</i>

1285
01:44:38,500 --> 01:44:41,416
Don't be mad at me anymore, please.

1286
01:44:59,791 --> 01:45:03,000
Girls, go and play in your room.

1287
01:45:11,958 --> 01:45:15,083
Shampoo introduced you to Klára,
didn't he?

1288
01:45:16,250 --> 01:45:17,333
Yeah.

1289
01:45:18,250 --> 01:45:20,791
He introduced me to one girl as well.

1290
01:45:21,500 --> 01:45:25,291
She was probably the most beautiful girl
I've ever slept with.

1291
01:45:25,375 --> 01:45:30,791
He said she liked it so much that
she wouldn't even mind my stupid bullshit.

1292
01:45:31,666 --> 01:45:33,250
Did she have red hair?

1293
01:45:34,791 --> 01:45:35,833
Yeah.

1294
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,250
He introduced me to her too.

1295
01:45:39,833 --> 01:45:42,458
He said he couldn't get rid of her.

1296
01:45:43,458 --> 01:45:46,666
Yeah, he was quite generous, that's true.

1297
01:45:50,875 --> 01:45:54,250
So our famous game's over.

1298
01:45:55,041 --> 01:45:57,916
Shampoo suggested a third task.

1299
01:45:58,000 --> 01:45:59,041
What?

1300
01:46:00,083 --> 01:46:04,250
That everyone should do what they fear
the most.

1301
01:46:10,875 --> 01:46:11,875
Darling?

1302
01:46:11,958 --> 01:46:15,208
Hi, are you coming? I miss you so much.

1303
01:46:15,291 --> 01:46:17,250
Yeah, we're leaving now.

1304
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:20,958
Don't worry.

1305
01:46:21,041 --> 01:46:24,541
I have everything packed.
I won't forget anything.

1306
01:46:26,791 --> 01:46:29,750
-It's not working.
-Give it some time, it will.

1307
01:46:29,833 --> 01:46:33,250
Even the books.
We'll be with you in a moment.

1308
01:46:33,708 --> 01:46:36,208
-Stop it.
-It's useless!

1309
01:46:38,583 --> 01:46:39,500
Yeah.

1310
01:46:39,583 --> 01:46:41,750
Well,
I'm really looking forward to you all.

1311
01:46:41,833 --> 01:46:44,708
-Bye, bye and kisses.
-Bye, bye and kisses.

1312
01:46:46,791 --> 01:46:48,750
-Exactly.
-Wait.

1313
01:46:50,208 --> 01:46:52,208
Come here.

1314
01:46:53,125 --> 01:46:55,041
Come on, come on.

1315
01:46:55,708 --> 01:46:57,291
We'll help you with the girls.

1316
01:46:57,375 --> 01:46:58,291
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1317
01:46:58,375 --> 01:47:03,833
I can stay with you. I can cook
quite well. And the girls will enjoy it.

1318
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:05,041
Yeah.

1319
01:47:05,500 --> 01:47:06,875
Thank you, guys.

1320
01:47:07,625 --> 01:47:09,750
-Stop screaming.
-Yeah, yeah.

1321
01:47:31,625 --> 01:47:32,541
Good morning.

1322
01:47:32,625 --> 01:47:33,541
Good morning.

1323
01:47:33,625 --> 01:47:35,625
I'm looking for a nurse called Irenka.

1324
01:47:35,750 --> 01:47:36,750
Irenka?

1325
01:47:42,083 --> 01:47:43,125
Thank you.

1326
01:47:53,833 --> 01:47:54,875
Good morning.

1327
01:48:04,875 --> 01:48:06,875
I've come to tell you that…

1328
01:48:09,291 --> 01:48:10,708
I'm an idiot.

1329
01:48:12,458 --> 01:48:18,000
And that I'd be sad if you didn't move to
my mother's place just because of me.

1330
01:48:18,833 --> 01:48:22,333
So perhaps I'll see you there one day.

1331
01:48:27,666 --> 01:48:29,291
Okay, I'm going now.

1332
01:48:40,583 --> 01:48:43,666
<i>They swore love to each other</i>

1333
01:48:46,333 --> 01:48:48,666
<i>Under the bridge arch</i>

1334
01:48:51,833 --> 01:48:55,250
<i>And then they were together</i>

1335
01:48:57,708 --> 01:49:00,375
<i>Throughout the life…</i>

1336
01:49:01,041 --> 01:49:02,416
-Thanks.
-Please.

1337
01:49:03,500 --> 01:49:06,208
<i>They swore love to each other</i>

1338
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:16,208
<i>They had only modest wishes</i>

<i>August shooting stars</i>

1340
01:49:24,250 --> 01:49:27,458
<i>And perhaps besides love</i>

1341
01:49:29,791 --> 01:49:32,458
<i>Nothing bothered me</i>

1342
01:49:35,916 --> 01:49:39,083
<i>They had only modest wishes</i>

1343
01:49:41,791 --> 01:49:44,541
<i>Time is responsible for everything</i>

1344
01:49:49,458 --> 01:49:55,416
<i>The one that hides in us</i>

1345
01:49:58,458 --> 01:50:04,250
<i>And one second is longer than a year</i>

1346
01:50:06,333 --> 01:50:10,125
<i>He left one morning</i>

1347
01:50:11,916 --> 01:50:15,583
<i>-And he took their memories with him</i>
-Lovely pancakes, beautifully prepared.

1348
01:50:15,666 --> 01:50:21,083
Who wants them?
Who deserves a pancake? Come on.

1349
01:50:21,416 --> 01:50:22,250
Enjoy your meal!

1350
01:50:22,333 --> 01:50:25,833
<i>And no one cried at all</i>

-Hi.

<i>-He left one morning…</i>
<i>-So what?</i>

1353
01:50:31,416 --> 01:50:32,458
Beautiful.
