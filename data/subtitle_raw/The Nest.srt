1
00:00:33,807 --> 00:00:37,004
THE NEST

2
00:01:19,687 --> 00:01:22,599
The Pepsis
or 'Tarantula Hawk Wasp'...

3
00:01:22,727 --> 00:01:27,198
... is one of the biggest existing wasps
with a wingspan of 12 cm.

4
00:01:30,447 --> 00:01:32,324
This predator...

5
00:01:32,447 --> 00:01:37,396
... also likes the nectar
of certain flowers in the Amazon.

6
00:01:52,087 --> 00:01:56,399
It kills its victims by laying
an egg in them...

7
00:01:56,527 --> 00:02:01,885
... and hence it's not a real parasite,
but a parasitoid.

8
00:02:04,367 --> 00:02:07,325
It drags the spider to its burrow...

9
00:02:07,447 --> 00:02:12,362
... and waits until the poison
has completely paralysed the spider.

10
00:02:12,487 --> 00:02:16,605
It then lays its eggs on top
of the immobilised victim.

11
00:02:20,887 --> 00:02:24,766
The larvae feed on the still 
living tarantula...

12
00:02:24,887 --> 00:02:27,481
... from the inside.

13
00:02:54,167 --> 00:02:57,443
Suburb of Strasbourg

14
00:02:58,367 --> 00:03:01,200
Thursday July 14

15
00:05:24,367 --> 00:05:26,927
The landing procedure has been iniated.

16
00:05:30,087 --> 00:05:32,601
We're landing in few moments.

17
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,565
Hello.

18
00:05:50,127 --> 00:05:54,086
More than friends... family.
- How's your baby?

19
00:05:55,087 --> 00:05:56,964
Look.

20
00:05:59,887 --> 00:06:03,436
Just as pretty as her mother.
- Keep it.

21
00:06:18,327 --> 00:06:21,797
And your daughters, Giovanni ?
- The oldest is a disaster.

22
00:06:21,927 --> 00:06:25,044
She always wants to sleep
with Gina and me.

23
00:06:29,687 --> 00:06:31,086
Here.

24
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:33,439
What's that?

25
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:38,800
Information about that asshole.
We followed him to Germany.

26
00:06:38,927 --> 00:06:42,317
The trial is going
to be a big fuss.

27
00:08:18,647 --> 00:08:20,558
Hi, Tony.

28
00:08:25,687 --> 00:08:27,359
Hurry up.

29
00:09:15,967 --> 00:09:18,037
Not for me.

30
00:09:18,167 --> 00:09:20,158
I don't want that.

31
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:39,200
When can I come?
- That's up to your brother.

32
00:10:18,847 --> 00:10:22,123
Colmar, military airport.

33
00:12:06,567 --> 00:12:08,000
Secured.

34
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:24,997
Northeast-Albania

35
00:12:32,247 --> 00:12:35,637
It will be fine.
We'll use silencers.

36
00:13:09,887 --> 00:13:12,720
Strasbourg - Industrial Park

37
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:45,559
Jesus, you're always late.
Even Spitz is already here.

38
00:14:49,007 --> 00:14:51,475
You try the nightshift, asshole.

39
00:15:07,847 --> 00:15:10,884
National Highway 83

40
00:15:45,447 --> 00:15:49,156
Captain, they just went up
the A35.

41
00:17:37,127 --> 00:17:43,396
Tomorrow, the trial of Abedin Nexhep
starts in Strasbourg...

42
00:17:43,527 --> 00:17:46,883
... the suspected leader
of the Albanian mafia.

43
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:50,841
He's under suspicion of trade in women...

44
00:17:50,967 --> 00:17:53,640
... weapons and assault.

45
00:17:53,767 --> 00:17:57,157
A report of Gilles Dupa
from Strasbourg.

46
00:17:57,287 --> 00:18:02,520
In Eastern-Europe Nexhep is the
key figure of an immense mafia network.

47
00:18:02,647 --> 00:18:07,880
He has been arrested during
a business trip to Germany...

48
00:18:08,007 --> 00:18:13,604
... thanks to a cooperation between
the German, Italian and French police.

49
00:18:13,727 --> 00:18:16,878
The trial being held in Strasbourg
has a symbolic meaning.

50
00:18:22,447 --> 00:18:25,280
Strasbourg - Industrial Park

51
00:18:39,887 --> 00:18:41,878
Are you scared?

52
00:18:44,807 --> 00:18:49,119
Who do you think you are?
You're the woman here.

53
00:18:49,247 --> 00:18:52,319
You can sit in front of the computer,
that's it.

54
00:18:52,447 --> 00:18:55,325
And if you're nice, who knows...

55
00:18:55,447 --> 00:19:00,157
Selim, don't even think about it.
I don't like you.

56
00:19:16,847 --> 00:19:18,678
Go on, Martial.

57
00:19:31,287 --> 00:19:34,882
Slavery is the right word.

58
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:40,240
They're stuck in a totalitarian system
and have no way to get out.

59
00:19:40,367 --> 00:19:45,157
Some girls even have a number
burned in their skin.

60
00:19:45,287 --> 00:19:49,405
As if they're merchandise, not people.

61
00:19:49,527 --> 00:19:53,566
A girl
that tried to escape...

62
00:19:53,687 --> 00:19:56,963
... was shot in her legs.

63
00:20:13,927 --> 00:20:17,476
What do you want with a gun?
You're crazy.

64
00:20:17,607 --> 00:20:21,077
Do Nasser and Santino know?
- Shut up.

65
00:20:21,207 --> 00:20:25,041
You're scared.
- You're starting to loose control, Nadia.

66
00:20:26,047 --> 00:20:28,117
Sissy.

67
00:20:29,367 --> 00:20:31,198
Put that light out.

68
00:20:33,447 --> 00:20:36,086
Martial was a good idea.

69
00:20:38,567 --> 00:20:43,243
Believe me, Santi.
We'll never go to prison again.

70
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:46,359
We'll soon be lying in the sun.

71
00:21:05,687 --> 00:21:07,405
no reception

72
00:22:00,367 --> 00:22:02,961
Lieutenant Laborie.

73
00:22:03,087 --> 00:22:07,080
All traffic is jammed
because of an accident.

74
00:22:11,487 --> 00:22:14,559
Change route.
Warn headquarters.

75
00:25:03,407 --> 00:25:08,800
And there they are,
the Parisian fire brigade...

76
00:25:08,927 --> 00:25:12,761
... which recently suffered
severe losses.

77
00:25:12,887 --> 00:25:17,802
One colleague died on July 7
in a gas explosion.

78
00:25:17,927 --> 00:25:20,725
And two colleagues...

79
00:25:23,007 --> 00:25:26,522
Louis, why did you leave
the fire brigade?

80
00:25:26,647 --> 00:25:28,956
They're true soldiers.

81
00:27:28,167 --> 00:27:31,921
Stop it.
It gets to you.

82
00:27:50,607 --> 00:27:52,723
Santi?
- What?

83
00:27:53,807 --> 00:27:55,365
Fuck you.

84
00:27:55,487 --> 00:27:57,523
Fuck you too.

85
00:29:28,807 --> 00:29:31,196
Here's some ammo.

86
00:30:10,607 --> 00:30:13,405
Hold your dog or I'll shoot.
- He's tied up.

87
00:30:13,527 --> 00:30:15,677
Quiet. Get up.

88
00:30:19,887 --> 00:30:23,482
Don't move.
- Take my gun.

89
00:30:25,607 --> 00:30:27,757
Take it.

90
00:30:28,607 --> 00:30:30,882
Take his gun damned.

91
00:30:34,367 --> 00:30:37,484
Get up.
- Outside.

92
00:30:40,087 --> 00:30:43,045
Don't try to fool us.
- We're no heroes.

93
00:30:55,727 --> 00:30:59,515
Everything alright?
Did you tie them up well?

94
00:30:59,647 --> 00:31:03,640
Martial was good, eh?
What an acrobat.

95
00:31:03,767 --> 00:31:08,682
Go stand on the lookout.
Now you can prove yourself.

96
00:32:01,767 --> 00:32:03,325
Roadwork?

97
00:32:03,447 --> 00:32:07,076
The road has just been asphalted.
How can I get home now?

98
00:32:07,207 --> 00:32:09,767
You'll let me pass or...

99
00:32:23,847 --> 00:32:25,883
Down, down.

100
00:32:28,207 --> 00:32:29,959
Here.

101
00:32:30,087 --> 00:32:34,399
Is it working?
- We're almost there. Farther, farther.

102
00:32:36,047 --> 00:32:38,481
That's it.

103
00:32:38,607 --> 00:32:40,563
P20, P21...

104
00:32:44,847 --> 00:32:48,522
Thank you, Santa Claus.

105
00:33:09,247 --> 00:33:12,956
That's a whole pallet.
- Two pallets.

106
00:35:40,767 --> 00:35:41,882
Start.

107
00:36:57,727 --> 00:37:01,766
Captain, we've lost contact
with the armoured car.

108
00:37:01,887 --> 00:37:03,798
Understood Captain.

109
00:37:30,727 --> 00:37:32,206
Fuck.

110
00:37:35,887 --> 00:37:37,764
Shit.

111
00:37:45,527 --> 00:37:49,759
Headquarters for Anemone 12.
Do you read me?

112
00:37:49,887 --> 00:37:54,005
It's no computer malfunction.
- Call major Girés.

113
00:37:54,127 --> 00:37:57,199
He's in Paris, at the defile.

114
00:37:57,327 --> 00:38:00,319
Colonel Fabre then.
- Also in Paris.

115
00:38:03,607 --> 00:38:05,802
Anemone 12, do you read me?

116
00:38:47,527 --> 00:38:50,121
There's someone at that warehouse.

117
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:07,846
Someone's coming.
Probably cops.

118
00:39:07,967 --> 00:39:09,844
Quiet, calm.

119
00:39:11,567 --> 00:39:13,683
It's the cops.

120
00:39:16,967 --> 00:39:18,719
This way.

121
00:40:20,527 --> 00:40:21,926
This way.

122
00:40:38,847 --> 00:40:41,839
Anemone 12...

123
00:40:48,527 --> 00:40:50,119
Shit.

124
00:42:44,967 --> 00:42:47,003
A special squad.

125
00:42:54,487 --> 00:42:56,842
No.
- Who then?

126
00:42:56,967 --> 00:42:58,320
Nasser?

127
00:42:58,447 --> 00:42:59,880
There.

128
00:43:06,847 --> 00:43:08,246
Get down.

129
00:44:08,167 --> 00:44:09,919
Fuckers.

130
00:47:52,007 --> 00:47:55,477
Everything ok?
- Yes.

131
00:47:55,607 --> 00:47:58,565
You too?
- Yes.

132
00:48:00,167 --> 00:48:02,476
Our driver is dead.

133
00:49:26,047 --> 00:49:28,163
Police. Don't move.

134
00:49:28,287 --> 00:49:31,006
Who are those guys outside?

135
00:49:31,127 --> 00:49:34,119
Don't move.
- Don't shoot.

136
00:49:34,247 --> 00:49:36,397
Hands up.
- Don't shoot.

137
00:49:36,527 --> 00:49:38,518
Hands on your head.

138
00:49:40,887 --> 00:49:45,165
It's all my fault.
- No, it isn't.

139
00:49:45,287 --> 00:49:48,757
Hands up.
- Calm now.

140
00:49:49,847 --> 00:49:54,045
Take it.
- I'm dying of pain.

141
00:49:56,287 --> 00:49:59,643
I'm scared.
- We're going to make it.

142
00:49:59,767 --> 00:50:02,042
We'll get out of this.

143
00:50:02,167 --> 00:50:06,445
I'm scared. Hold me.
- I'm holding you.

144
00:50:15,247 --> 00:50:16,965
Let me.

145
00:50:20,047 --> 00:50:22,322
Santi?
- I'm here.

146
00:50:22,447 --> 00:50:24,802
Don't move.

147
00:50:28,447 --> 00:50:30,961
Squeeze my hand.

148
00:50:31,087 --> 00:50:34,523
Do you feel anything?
- Nothing.

149
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:39,279
I'm fucked up.

150
00:50:39,407 --> 00:50:42,319
No, you're not.

151
00:50:42,447 --> 00:50:45,644
I'll be in a wheelchair.

152
00:50:45,767 --> 00:50:48,486
I don't want that.
- I'll stay with you.

153
00:50:48,607 --> 00:50:50,563
I don't want that.
- Stay calm.

154
00:50:50,687 --> 00:50:52,757
I'm so cold.
- You're strong.

155
00:50:52,887 --> 00:50:55,196
I'm so cold.

156
00:50:58,607 --> 00:51:01,280
He's dead.
- No, unconscious.

157
00:51:02,287 --> 00:51:05,006
I swear I won't leave you.

158
00:51:05,127 --> 00:51:07,641
I'll get my first aid kid.

159
00:51:47,407 --> 00:51:50,444
What do those guys outside want?

160
00:51:50,567 --> 00:51:54,116
What do they want?

161
00:51:55,527 --> 00:51:58,758
A prisoner.
- No concern of ours.

162
00:51:58,887 --> 00:52:01,720
Let's leave here.

163
00:52:02,847 --> 00:52:07,159
They probably won't like that.
- That's our problem.

164
00:52:07,287 --> 00:52:10,484
We can't move Nasser like this.

165
00:52:10,607 --> 00:52:13,519
We have to get out of here.
- Selim is right.

166
00:52:13,647 --> 00:52:17,322
If we move him now,
he'll die. Understand?

167
00:52:43,767 --> 00:52:48,363
Nasser is my buddy too.
But he said himself:

168
00:52:48,487 --> 00:52:50,921
If something goes wrong, get out.

169
00:53:00,487 --> 00:53:04,036
Look for yourself,
he's dying.

170
00:53:05,047 --> 00:53:09,598
You should be ashamed.
And you have a short-term memory.

171
00:53:09,727 --> 00:53:12,446
Here are the keys.
Get lost.

172
00:53:12,567 --> 00:53:17,482
What is it? You want to go with him, Nadia?
Run away, cowards.

173
00:53:17,607 --> 00:53:21,885
It's not running away.
- What is it then? I'm staying here.

174
00:53:24,527 --> 00:53:26,518
I'm staying too.

175
00:53:36,887 --> 00:53:39,196
So what are you going to do?

176
00:53:40,727 --> 00:53:43,878
He's not the problem.

177
00:53:44,007 --> 00:53:46,760
That guy in the car is.

178
00:53:46,887 --> 00:53:49,640
He's what they want.

179
00:53:50,167 --> 00:53:52,601
Hey, cop.
- What are you doing?

180
00:53:52,727 --> 00:53:55,321
Let that guy go.
- Never.

181
00:53:55,447 --> 00:53:57,677
Fire, bitch.

182
00:53:57,807 --> 00:54:00,196
Drop your gun.

183
00:54:06,087 --> 00:54:08,078
This way.

184
00:54:14,927 --> 00:54:16,599
Upstairs.

185
00:55:24,007 --> 00:55:26,567
This way.

186
00:55:26,687 --> 00:55:28,040
Inside.

187
00:56:26,927 --> 00:56:29,077
Listen up.

188
00:56:50,967 --> 00:56:54,403
Do you read me, Giovanni?
- Yes.

189
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:58,042
Someone must have heard the alarm.
- I hope so.

190
00:57:38,607 --> 00:57:40,837
Who are all those dead guys?

191
00:57:58,927 --> 00:58:00,918
He's cold.

192
00:58:02,447 --> 00:58:06,042
It'll be fine.
- I can't feel anything.

193
00:58:07,847 --> 00:58:10,236
He can't move.

194
00:58:11,367 --> 00:58:13,517
Let me know if it hurts.

195
00:58:23,807 --> 00:58:26,799
Santi, let us go home,
please.

196
00:58:26,927 --> 00:58:29,236
You can't move.

197
00:58:29,367 --> 00:58:33,645
I want a blanket.
- I'll get you one.

198
00:58:33,767 --> 00:58:36,235
It's so cold in here.

199
00:58:39,967 --> 00:58:41,923
What's he doing?

200
00:58:43,807 --> 00:58:46,924
Santi, we must get him out of here.

201
00:58:56,487 --> 00:58:59,638
This leads to the canal.
But it's very narrow.

202
00:58:59,767 --> 00:59:04,238
He's an incredible acrobat,
both in the air and underground.

203
00:59:04,367 --> 00:59:06,517
Isn't that right, Martial ?

204
00:59:27,367 --> 00:59:30,120
Are you hurt? Let me see.

205
00:59:32,607 --> 00:59:37,920
Your friend isn't going to make it.
He must be somewhere warm and quiet.

206
00:59:38,047 --> 00:59:41,926
In the control room.
Your wound isn't serious.

207
00:59:42,047 --> 00:59:44,117
This is for him.

208
01:00:42,807 --> 01:00:45,162
Giovanni?

209
01:00:45,287 --> 01:00:48,120
How much ammo have you got left?

210
01:00:48,247 --> 01:00:51,159
Look outside. What do you see?

211
01:00:54,247 --> 01:00:56,966
Nothing. Why?

212
01:00:57,087 --> 01:00:59,999
They removed their casualties.

213
01:01:05,727 --> 01:01:11,085
From a distance it seems like
nothing is going on here.

214
01:01:17,287 --> 01:01:20,165
Giovanni agrees
to give them weapons.

215
01:01:20,287 --> 01:01:23,518
Only you can decide that.

216
01:01:23,647 --> 01:01:29,324
I'm asking your opinion.
- Giovanni and I are not allowed to have one.

217
01:01:33,767 --> 01:01:38,761
Don't hide behind orders
like that bulletproof mask.

218
01:01:38,887 --> 01:01:41,321
You're getting emotional.

219
01:01:43,327 --> 01:01:45,363
Fuck you.

220
01:02:03,367 --> 01:02:07,679
You're all going to die.
Understand?

221
01:02:09,367 --> 01:02:11,722
They'll kill you.

222
01:02:12,767 --> 01:02:17,318
You don't frighten me.
I won't have mercy on you either.

223
01:02:17,447 --> 01:02:19,677
A woman...

224
01:02:25,407 --> 01:02:27,523
can you handle this?

225
01:02:27,647 --> 01:02:29,365
Give me.

226
01:02:34,847 --> 01:02:38,044
It's all hands on deck.
Take it.

227
01:02:42,327 --> 01:02:45,080
And no joking around.

228
01:02:45,207 --> 01:02:48,916
Or you'll have me to deal with.
- Oh yeah?

229
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:59,076
Can you handle this?

230
01:02:59,207 --> 01:03:01,437
Safety pin off.

231
01:03:02,567 --> 01:03:04,683
Check...

232
01:03:04,807 --> 01:03:07,037
... and aim with your laser.

233
01:03:07,167 --> 01:03:10,284
Haven't you got anything else for me?

234
01:03:15,087 --> 01:03:17,885
Shut up.
- Stupid bitch.

235
01:03:27,687 --> 01:03:29,837
What are you doing?

236
01:03:31,167 --> 01:03:33,727
We're all in the same shit.

237
01:03:59,687 --> 01:04:02,121
Hey, you there.

238
01:04:02,247 --> 01:04:05,364
Come down and get this on.

239
01:04:06,367 --> 01:04:08,642
Have you got any weapons?
- A short rifle.

240
01:04:08,767 --> 01:04:10,962
Get him.

241
01:04:26,007 --> 01:04:28,282
Don't shoot. I'm the security guard.

242
01:04:28,407 --> 01:04:30,796
Do you have a gun?
- No.

243
01:04:36,207 --> 01:04:38,880
Take it.
- I'm not a part of this.

244
01:04:39,007 --> 01:04:42,158
I have to watch my screens.

245
01:04:43,207 --> 01:04:45,767
What's your name?
- Spitz.

246
01:04:47,767 --> 01:04:51,043
Make yourself useful, Spitz,
and put on this vest.

247
01:04:51,167 --> 01:04:54,716
Warn me immediately if something
moves on your screens.

248
01:04:56,687 --> 01:04:58,405
Come on.

249
01:06:17,167 --> 01:06:19,965
Careful with his head.

250
01:06:22,167 --> 01:06:23,885
Are you managing?

251
01:06:25,247 --> 01:06:27,078
Turn.

252
01:06:30,287 --> 01:06:32,005
Lower, lower.

253
01:06:33,007 --> 01:06:35,567
Managing?
- Let it go.

254
01:08:35,367 --> 01:08:38,518
Where's Martial?
- Gone for help.

255
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:45,638
Hang in there.

256
01:08:45,767 --> 01:08:49,396
Don't worry,
we'll be lying in the sun soon.

257
01:09:07,247 --> 01:09:08,999
What's that?

258
01:09:11,727 --> 01:09:14,002
Don't be foolish. Come back.

259
01:09:16,047 --> 01:09:20,438
Come back, Spitz.
- Don't shoot. I surrender.

260
01:09:20,567 --> 01:09:22,762
I surrender.

261
01:09:22,887 --> 01:09:24,684
Don't shoot.

262
01:10:08,927 --> 01:10:10,679
Get out, bastard.

263
01:10:18,247 --> 01:10:21,000
Out of the way
- Put him back right now.

264
01:10:27,127 --> 01:10:30,005
Lower those weapons.

265
01:10:34,887 --> 01:10:37,685
They can have their leader.
This has to stop.

266
01:10:37,807 --> 01:10:40,162
Get back.
- Shut up.

267
01:10:40,287 --> 01:10:43,279
Get out of the way
or I'll shoot him.

268
01:10:43,407 --> 01:10:48,959
Do you know who that asshole is?
He raped hundreds of women.

269
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:51,647
I don't give a damn.

270
01:10:52,647 --> 01:10:54,239
Is that clear?

271
01:10:55,767 --> 01:10:59,999
You don't understand, Selim.
That guy stays here.

272
01:11:00,127 --> 01:11:03,278
Put him back.
- What's wrong with you?

273
01:11:03,407 --> 01:11:05,318
Back.

274
01:11:40,607 --> 01:11:42,802
What's in there?

275
01:11:44,887 --> 01:11:46,798
Goddamned.

276
01:12:22,727 --> 01:12:24,399
Let go.

277
01:14:22,407 --> 01:14:24,716
Is that your kid?

278
01:14:28,007 --> 01:14:31,363
A cute one. How old is he?

279
01:14:31,487 --> 01:14:33,603
Exactly one year.

280
01:14:35,007 --> 01:14:39,683
I have a son too.
My mother looks after him.

281
01:14:39,807 --> 01:14:42,685
How old is he?
- Six.

282
01:14:42,807 --> 01:14:45,560
A big one.

283
01:14:45,687 --> 01:14:47,996
And his dad?

284
01:14:53,407 --> 01:14:57,161
I wanted to do it on my own.
- I didn't.

285
01:15:08,767 --> 01:15:10,166
No.

286
01:15:20,287 --> 01:15:23,120
Northeast. Movement at ten o'clock.

287
01:15:23,847 --> 01:15:26,315
Southeast. Movement at nine o'clock.

288
01:15:27,487 --> 01:15:30,399
Movement at three o'clock.
- And at five o'clock.

289
01:15:31,407 --> 01:15:35,002
Shit, we'll never make it.

290
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:46,797
They're regrouping.
- They're going to slaughter us.

291
01:15:48,127 --> 01:15:52,200
They're coming in either way.
- We must buy some time.

292
01:15:52,327 --> 01:15:55,763
If we take cover here,
we can overlook everything.

293
01:15:55,887 --> 01:15:58,117
Not enough cover.

294
01:15:58,247 --> 01:16:00,283
But what else?

295
01:16:02,927 --> 01:16:04,997
I don't know.

296
01:16:09,167 --> 01:16:13,843
We'll build a wall of containers.
Bullets won't go through it.

297
01:16:13,967 --> 01:16:17,755
With loopholes.
- We're building a container wall.

298
01:16:17,887 --> 01:16:22,324
All exits have to be sealed.
That will stop them for a while.

299
01:16:22,447 --> 01:16:25,405
How much ammo do we have left?
- Ten magazines.

300
01:16:25,527 --> 01:16:28,325
I've got two.
- One box of shells.

301
01:16:28,447 --> 01:16:31,484
I've got eight bullets.

302
01:16:31,607 --> 01:16:33,677
That's not much.

303
01:16:37,127 --> 01:16:39,516
Shall we do it?

304
01:16:39,647 --> 01:16:41,239
You stay here.

305
01:16:56,807 --> 01:17:00,322
I have a plan to buy us some time
and get help.

306
01:17:01,327 --> 01:17:03,921
What is it?
- I'll escape.

307
01:17:04,047 --> 01:17:08,359
I know what I'm doing.
You'll just have to trust me.

308
01:17:10,847 --> 01:17:12,724
I'm coming with you.

309
01:17:21,127 --> 01:17:25,564
We haven't got enough chains.
Take that forklift truck.

310
01:17:27,487 --> 01:17:29,159
To the right.

311
01:17:31,087 --> 01:17:34,602
I'm coming back for you, Nasser.
I swear.

312
01:17:34,727 --> 01:17:37,002
With an ambulance.

313
01:17:37,127 --> 01:17:39,925
You know, Selim...

314
01:17:40,047 --> 01:17:43,756
You handled it alright.
I blew it.

315
01:17:43,887 --> 01:17:45,957
No you didn't.

316
01:18:01,327 --> 01:18:03,761
Take good care of her.

317
01:18:35,207 --> 01:18:37,675
We're counting on you.

318
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:44,439
I'll be fine.

319
01:18:44,567 --> 01:18:46,797
Good luck.

320
01:18:53,167 --> 01:18:54,725
Drive.

321
01:20:03,767 --> 01:20:07,203
Connect, come on connect.

322
01:20:24,447 --> 01:20:29,202
It won't stop, damned.

323
01:20:29,327 --> 01:20:32,524
Calm down.
- I want to go home.

324
01:20:36,807 --> 01:20:40,038
It's my fault, my fault.

325
01:21:03,887 --> 01:21:07,197
I'm staying here
to guard that motherfucker.

326
01:21:42,607 --> 01:21:45,804
Slut.
- No you're the slut.

327
01:21:47,287 --> 01:21:50,199
When I was a little girl...

328
01:21:50,327 --> 01:21:53,000
... a dog like you beat me...

329
01:21:53,127 --> 01:21:55,687
... and dumped his seed in me.

330
01:21:55,807 --> 01:21:59,197
I have sworn
I would crack his balls some day.

331
01:22:04,567 --> 01:22:06,797
What are you doing?

332
01:22:06,927 --> 01:22:10,237
You're hurting me. Stop it.

333
01:22:10,367 --> 01:22:13,484
That's no use. Get lost.

334
01:27:44,887 --> 01:27:46,366
Down there.

335
01:27:58,887 --> 01:28:01,560
Come one.
- I'm staying with him.

336
01:28:01,687 --> 01:28:04,918
You have to go with them.
- No.

337
01:28:10,927 --> 01:28:14,886
The cellar is our only chance.
- Leave a weapon behind.

338
01:28:19,087 --> 01:28:21,123
Four bullets.
- Come on.

339
01:28:22,127 --> 01:28:23,799
Get out of here.

340
01:28:29,527 --> 01:28:31,245
Nasser...

341
01:28:31,767 --> 01:28:35,282
Go on, Santi. Go on.

342
01:28:45,087 --> 01:28:48,159
I'm dying.

343
01:28:48,287 --> 01:28:51,245
You won't leave, will you?

344
01:28:51,367 --> 01:28:53,597
Nonsense, you're not dying.

345
01:28:54,607 --> 01:28:56,518
Let's go.

346
01:29:12,247 --> 01:29:14,442
We're all going to die.

347
01:29:36,287 --> 01:29:38,642
The sun, brother.

348
01:29:41,287 --> 01:29:42,561
The sun...

349
01:29:54,727 --> 01:29:56,160
Turn around.

350
01:30:06,287 --> 01:30:07,686
Come.

351
01:30:11,007 --> 01:30:12,884
Make sure it's spread everywhere.

352
01:30:20,967 --> 01:30:22,446
They're coming.

353
01:30:23,447 --> 01:30:24,960
Inside.

354
01:30:27,447 --> 01:30:29,438
But what about you?

355
01:30:29,567 --> 01:30:31,558
I'll be fine.

356
01:30:33,687 --> 01:30:35,279
I'll be fine.

357
01:33:04,647 --> 01:33:07,639
Beat it.
This is a secured area.

358
01:33:10,407 --> 01:33:13,399
It's an inferno, bodies everywhere.

359
01:33:13,527 --> 01:33:16,200
