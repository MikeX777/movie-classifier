00:03:23,914 --> 00:03:27,623
[1994 July 2, Midnight]

2
00:04:09,993 --> 00:04:11,415
This is the Parish Hall

3
00:04:28,011 --> 00:04:30,286
The prayer for the dead...
Please do it

4
00:04:38,588 --> 00:04:40,158
Andres Escobar?

5
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:48,724
The Colombian player?

6
00:04:55,372 --> 00:04:56,657
For hitting a self goal

7
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,463
To be frank, I can't sleep
after hearing that, Father

8
00:05:06,716 --> 00:05:08,377
Look at his face, Father

9
00:05:15,792 --> 00:05:18,181
and those who are sad, depend on You

10
00:05:24,734 --> 00:05:28,886
The Father, the Son, and
the Holy Spirit, the Lord of all, forever

11
00:05:34,878 --> 00:05:36,163
Amen!

12
00:05:42,952 --> 00:05:47,070
As you arrive with grace
on the day ofjudgement

13
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:04,466
[Continues the prayer]

14
00:06:11,748 --> 00:06:14,023
That was my father
Chandramohan

15
00:06:20,757 --> 00:06:22,827
The story of the football
fans of Kaattoorkadavu

16
00:06:38,908 --> 00:06:41,331
Hey! Buy sweets for everyone

17
00:06:57,927 --> 00:06:59,849
- Khaderkutty?
- Seems like you're busy?

18
00:07:09,572 --> 00:07:10,800
Didn't you bring sweets?

19
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,924
Keep this next to the well

20
00:07:38,501 --> 00:07:40,230
He was the defender of
the Columbian team

21
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:50,147
Because of that, many people
ganged up and shot him dead

22
00:07:57,754 --> 00:07:59,267
- My dear father!
-Yes!

23
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:55,971
If they continue to play like that,
we will win the cup for sure!

24
00:09:13,663 --> 00:09:14,413
What happened?

25
00:09:40,823 --> 00:09:42,336
Say Hi, when you see him

26
00:10:21,764 --> 00:10:25,450
A stretch of green that Lord Parasurama
brought out from the sea with his axe

27
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,936
the biggest celebration of a huge group of
people in Kerala happens once in 4 years

28
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,660
Though different teams
have fans in our State,

29
00:10:48,925 --> 00:10:50,756
'2010 World Cup Season'

30
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,021
Najeeb!

31
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,224
No, it will scratch you!

32
00:12:08,471 --> 00:12:11,941
Suni, before you wrote that, we took
measurements and printed the flex!

33
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:20,422
Instead of writing 'Booked' on trees &
pillars, go write that on the World Cup!

34
00:12:46,342 --> 00:12:51,314
"A naughty breeze,
or a striking lightning?"

35
00:12:52,081 --> 00:12:56,825
"Are you a smart jasmine flower?"

36
00:13:03,326 --> 00:13:07,535
"0 smiling girl!"

37
00:13:21,911 --> 00:13:25,540
This fight happened now,
just because of her

38
00:13:32,121 --> 00:13:33,861
What all are you reading?

39
00:13:41,164 --> 00:13:42,233
Can't you call before coming?

40
00:13:51,307 --> 00:13:53,195
The meeting at the library
will start now

41
00:13:59,582 --> 00:14:00,651
I need to take bath

42
00:14:09,525 --> 00:14:11,004
Don't wearthat cream shirt

43
00:14:18,201 --> 00:14:20,749
Even though you are handsome,
you don't have any sense of beauty!

44
00:14:27,476 --> 00:14:30,775
Baby Chandana, Smitha Thomas and
all are talking about you now

45
00:14:46,462 --> 00:14:47,975
That's all here
Yo u com e

46
00:15:05,081 --> 00:15:08,767
"A glance, as precious as a treasure"

47
00:15:13,923 --> 00:15:17,427
"A glance with a smile on the lips"

48
00:15:22,231 --> 00:15:25,974
"If we sit together merrily, my beauty"

49
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,545
"As the heart flies high
like a small feather"

50
00:15:42,485 --> 00:15:44,703
There's a knack for all this
Do what I tell you

51
00:15:53,362 --> 00:15:57,742
"If we sit together merrily,
my beauty"

52
00:16:02,038 --> 00:16:04,927
- But isn't she slightly olderthan me?
- Crap!

53
00:16:12,048 --> 00:16:13,936
That's true
I need to start reading, right?

54
00:16:21,557 --> 00:16:23,013
She would have
mistaken us orwhat?

55
00:16:31,701 --> 00:16:34,033
- By the by, Krishna...
- Not interested

56
00:16:39,608 --> 00:16:41,792
That's not the tension
I'm not as good looking as you, right?

57
00:16:42,178 --> 00:16:43,247
Come, boy! Let's go!

58
00:16:51,387 --> 00:16:52,251
What say?

59
00:17:00,529 --> 00:17:02,770
Herdad Khaderkutty
should be saluted!

60
00:17:11,307 --> 00:17:12,126
Hey Palliveedan!

61
00:17:12,341 --> 00:17:13,444
Hello! Just a second

62
00:17:22,051 --> 00:17:22,949
Chechi...
I mean...

63
00:17:49,211 --> 00:17:52,135
Which all are the important tourist
attractions in ancient Roman empire?

64
00:17:57,753 --> 00:18:00,768
Crap! This is why Emperor Nero
burned all this down!

65
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:09,424
Open the door
lwant to come inside

66
00:18:19,075 --> 00:18:20,406
I'll write the romantic poem

67
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,306
Dude, that won't be right
Please write it

68
00:18:39,662 --> 00:18:40,970
Come on, say it!

69
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:49,240
For her, you need to be
literally proficient

70
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,315
"A glance, as precious as a treasure"

71
00:19:13,329 --> 00:19:16,924
"A glance with a smile on the lips"

72
00:19:24,773 --> 00:19:26,821
This was the turning
point in my life

73
00:19:31,347 --> 00:19:35,556
When it has to come, love catches
a bus and comes into our lives correctly!

A) l4<ZowzCL£m~A£

75
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:22,797
"0 sweet moonlight, did you touch
within my heart with yourfingertip?"

76
00:20:25,301 --> 00:20:33,470
"0 sweet breeze, did your soft verses
just give me a kiss on my ears?"

77
00:20:34,843 --> 00:20:44,036
"Did someone come rushing to my memory,
as a thousand stars?"

78
00:20:55,364 --> 00:21:26,903
A) l4<ZowzCL£m~A£

79
00:21:32,268 --> 00:21:40,789
"Is a mysterious fragrance
caressing my soul?"

80
00:21:42,544 --> 00:21:51,100
"ls someone approaching
my door-step without telling me?"

81
00:21:52,688 --> 00:22:01,653
"I can hearthe rhythm of footsteps
approaching my lonely path"

82
00:22:02,998 --> 00:22:12,134
"I am drifting like a flower,
in this feeling that can't be named"

83
00:22:13,475 --> 00:22:21,314
"0 sweet moonlight, did you touch
within my heart with yourfingertip?"

84
00:22:23,619 --> 00:22:31,549
"0 sweet breeze, did your soft verses
just give me a kiss on my ears?"

85
00:22:33,062 --> 00:22:42,471
"Did someone come rushing to
my memory, as a thousand stars?"

A) l4<ZowzCL£m~A£

87
00:23:10,632 --> 00:23:12,145
We're not saying this because we're
in 12th and you're in 11th

88
00:23:20,476 --> 00:23:22,785
- Understood whatl said?
-Juniors, all of you leave!

89
00:23:28,717 --> 00:23:31,402
Don't you know about PTA's decision that
politics isn't allowed in school, Ajayan?

90
00:23:38,594 --> 00:23:41,222
We went to their houses & gave it to
them, without breaking any rules

91
00:23:50,873 --> 00:23:52,181
-Ajay, run!
- Hey!

92
00:23:59,148 --> 00:24:01,287
Sir, due to the presence of
gravity in this school ground,

93
00:24:09,591 --> 00:24:10,751
- Mehru, go to your class!
- Sir...

94
00:24:27,576 --> 00:24:29,589
You were floundering about
so much to say this?

95
00:24:46,862 --> 00:24:50,400
whenl see her, my heart beats like
the fireworks during our festival

96
00:24:57,573 --> 00:25:01,316
l'm clueless and l have
no idea what to do, man!

97
00:26:11,346 --> 00:26:14,213
Don't you guys cultivate
tobacco in your Kaattoor?

98
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:23,919
This 'Beedi' of yours
is too light

99
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,360
Vipinan!

100
00:26:41,143 --> 00:26:42,883
-What?
-A Colombian story of valour

101
00:26:57,726 --> 00:27:01,150
Still, isn't it better to confess
everything from your side?

102
00:27:07,636 --> 00:27:10,525
Escobar, don't come into
my fantasy and speak nonsense

103
00:27:34,863 --> 00:27:38,230
continues in a draw without any goals,
even as it enters the 85th minute

104
00:27:47,142 --> 00:27:49,098
You losers! Someone hit a goal, man!

105
00:27:53,348 --> 00:27:55,651
-
 only asked for some water
- Go and hit a goal!

106
00:27:55,651 --> 00:27:56,754
Come on!

107
00:28:04,793 --> 00:28:06,488
We'll be the ones raising
this football cup!

108
00:28:14,703 --> 00:28:16,978

f
 lose this game, 
'


shave off half my hair

109
00:28:22,444 --> 00:28:24,901
Palliveedan, you're the captain
of Green house...place the bet!

110
00:28:33,822 --> 00:28:37,508
the star player of Red house, Vipinan,
is moving forward strongly...

111
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:55,892
The possibility of a goal is
disappearing forthe Red house now

112
00:29:10,058 --> 00:29:14,267
We can see an injured Vipinan
limping out ofthe ground

113
00:29:19,067 --> 00:29:20,637
- Hey! 
'

 sort you later
-You get lost!

114
00:29:27,042 --> 00:29:29,203
I'll give my boots
Ask if someone else is ready to play!

115
00:29:39,254 --> 00:29:40,095
Sir!

116
00:29:49,531 --> 00:29:50,395
Him?

117
00:29:57,139 --> 00:30:00,381
As a substitute for Vipinan,
Ajayghosh enters the ground now

118
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:09,678
Does he know to play football?

119
00:30:19,494 --> 00:30:22,509
Let's celebrate and go to the barber shop
here, and shave off your hair, okay?

120
00:30:27,369 --> 00:30:29,610
Their goalkeeper is
the district team player Vincent

121
00:30:39,581 --> 00:30:41,685
What are you? A hedgehog?
Running here and there?

122
00:30:49,491 --> 00:30:50,970
Suni, hit it!

123
00:30:59,367 --> 00:31:02,495
It's okay, Seban! It's the 90th minute
Just kick it smoothly

124
00:31:09,578 --> 00:31:11,307
Suni!

125
00:31:27,028 --> 00:31:30,065
With the single goal that Ajayghosh
scored in the last minute of extra time,

126
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,636
Mehru wouldn't have been
serious about it, right?

127
00:32:03,698 --> 00:32:07,065
Oh no! What a shame!

128
00:32:11,907 --> 00:32:15,001
Palliveedan has lost his hair!

129
00:32:20,982 --> 00:32:22,176
What happened, Chetta?

130
00:32:29,257 --> 00:32:31,680
Moreover, he's a voracious
reader too, right?

131
00:32:38,233 --> 00:32:40,747
After that, he never played football

132
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:49,422
Go, man!

133
00:33:06,661 --> 00:33:08,845
He stopped playing that day!
Right, Vipinan?

134
00:33:16,204 --> 00:33:17,774
I'm asking you out of that affection

135
00:33:26,214 --> 00:33:27,761
- Oh my God!
- Get lost!

136
00:33:45,066 --> 00:33:46,351
- Rascal!
- Three

137
00:33:53,241 --> 00:33:55,015
Dude, you ask Mehru directly

138
00:34:05,053 --> 00:34:06,281
If you like her, say it openly

139
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,834
If you're done peeing, come here

140
00:34:24,506 --> 00:34:25,518
Why are you so lethargic?

141
00:34:33,114 --> 00:34:36,265
Dude, do you remember our
Physics teacher from 8th grade?

142
00:34:43,792 --> 00:34:47,011
Well, l was thinking whetherl should
fill some air in this cycle tyre

143
00:35:05,246 --> 00:35:06,144
Mehru...

144
00:35:13,721 --> 00:35:15,052
That won't happen, boy!

145
00:35:20,829 --> 00:35:23,138
l have to go home and come there
right away to apply Henna

146
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:02,261
The boys in town are saying that Mehru and
that rascal Ajayghosh are dating now

147
00:36:08,143 --> 00:36:11,123
I could have lived with it, ifshe
didn't like me because I was a Hindu

148
00:36:17,886 --> 00:36:20,400
After all, he's from a lower
caste, rig ht Esco bar?

149
00:36:30,431 --> 00:36:31,272
Hey Vipinan...

150
00:36:38,373 --> 00:36:40,512
No! Leave it
You aren't old enough to knowthat

151
00:36:48,249 --> 00:36:51,173
But if Riquelme was also there,
it would have been even more awesome

152
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,249
What doubt?

153
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:11,474
But I heard you saying
about going to some bar?

154
00:37:18,413 --> 00:37:21,246
and to start making money
by riding an auto rickshaw

155
00:37:29,591 --> 00:37:32,367
This time, flexes are
trending apparently

156
00:37:52,013 --> 00:37:54,152
- Is it?
- Try to arrange the money forthe flex

157
00:38:02,657 --> 00:38:05,262
- Hey Sunny! Give me a packet of Beedis
-Yes, coming

158
00:38:13,067 --> 00:38:14,546
I'm thinking how
we will make that

159
00:38:23,278 --> 00:38:24,677
There aren't many days left

160
00:38:33,655 --> 00:38:36,283
There's only one way now
Get it from Thomas Master somehow

161
00:38:51,472 --> 00:38:53,042
- Mom!
- What is it?

162
00:39:00,548 --> 00:39:02,504
Try and get admission in
the Polytechnic first

163
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:03,691
Let's see after that

164
00:39:22,036 --> 00:39:23,606
I want to know now
if you were serious,

165
00:39:32,146 --> 00:39:33,431
I want a cowfull-time!

166
00:39:40,555 --> 00:39:42,796
Your son hasn't just
failed in 12th alone

167
00:39:51,432 --> 00:39:54,003
I want to buy a calf, feed
grass and water to it,

168
00:40:01,042 --> 00:40:02,373
Give me the money

169
00:40:11,853 --> 00:40:13,400
- Come
- Here's the full amount

170
00:40:22,497 --> 00:40:23,338
Come, dear

171
00:40:41,215 --> 00:40:42,944
My dear Messi, aren't
you seeing this?

172
00:40:49,824 --> 00:40:51,280
- Like that!
- Here! Eat it!

173
00:41:01,569 --> 00:41:02,797
Look who's here!
Vipin?

174
00:41:11,479 --> 00:41:12,377
That's true

175
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:13,626
I also feel so often

176
00:41:22,123 --> 00:41:23,954
It's an enemy country
I shouldn't be giving this

177
00:41:31,632 --> 00:41:33,645
No! We're going to try
out something new

178
00:41:49,116 --> 00:41:52,040
"The roar ofthe sea,
the preparation forthe battle"

179
00:42:01,796 --> 00:42:03,252
'Sri Ganesha'

180
00:42:18,212 --> 00:42:25,505
"The messiah of football is arriving
to the scorching heat ofthe Sahara"

181
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,331
We need to go to
the flex printing place right away

182
00:42:47,975 --> 00:42:49,488
- Let's go
-You're stinking, man!

183
00:43:07,228 --> 00:43:08,627
- Look!
- This is it

184
00:43:16,771 --> 00:43:18,693
Give this lion's head to Messi

185
00:43:28,616 --> 00:43:29,457
Chetta, no need all that

186
00:43:38,225 --> 00:43:39,419
Shut up and get lost!

187
00:43:47,134 --> 00:43:49,273
They have reached our
spot, to tie the flex

188
00:44:03,818 --> 00:44:06,594
because she leaked the news
about the flex to Ajayghosh

189
00:44:24,805 --> 00:44:27,581
Using a Panchayat member's power,
I will cut both these trees down

190
00:44:35,383 --> 00:44:38,659
and since there are Argentina fans and
Brazil fans in our village since ages,

191
00:44:44,025 --> 00:44:46,334
The club who wins
the toss can tie it first

192
00:44:54,669 --> 00:44:56,091
- Stop!
- It's okay for us

193
00:45:04,345 --> 00:45:06,176
- Move! Move!
- Hey!

194
00:45:12,853 --> 00:45:14,138
- Not for us?
-Who are you?

195
00:45:23,464 --> 00:45:24,692
Do you have a flex?

196
00:45:32,473 --> 00:45:33,337
Hey! Give me a coin

197
00:45:49,390 --> 00:45:52,427
Viva Brazil!

198
00:46:08,876 --> 00:46:12,027
"Speeding like a lightning"

199
00:46:14,682 --> 00:46:36,015
A) l4<Zowzﬁle~A£

200
00:46:48,582 --> 00:46:50,561
What all do you want to knoiAf?
Write it fast

201
00:47:06,333 --> 00:47:10,690
A) l4<Zowzﬁle~A£

202
00:47:13,841 --> 00:47:25,821
A) l4<Zowzﬁle~A£

203
00:47:32,927 --> 00:47:34,906
-Anji
i wood is also fine, right?
-Yes

204
00:47:43,304 --> 00:47:46,762
When they are roaming around for a space,
we should do that fans show in Kaattoor

205
00:47:53,514 --> 00:47:55,243
Mehru, ask him smoothly

206
00:48:20,541 --> 00:48:22,372
There's no fun in watching
the game at home

207
00:48:22,877 --> 00:48:25,061
Anyway, who watches the World Cup at home?

208
00:48:31,952 --> 00:48:33,237
Anyway, we need a colour TV

209
00:48:42,463 --> 00:48:43,976
He's an Argentina fan, right?

210
00:49:00,648 --> 00:49:03,947
And thus, flattering her dad,
Mehru got the TV from the mill

211
00:49:10,524 --> 00:49:12,333
They started their fan club
in the Karayogam room,

212
00:49:20,367 --> 00:49:23,461
Everyone started fan
clubs in a frenzy

213
00:49:28,108 --> 00:49:29,882
With four goals
scored against us

214
00:49:44,091 --> 00:49:46,275
I had warned Dad
not to vote for this rascal

215
00:50:06,246 --> 00:50:08,669
They didn't even give
me a chance to correct,

216
00:50:15,255 --> 00:50:16,768
You also stay strong, man!

217
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:27,260
It's not like that
everywhere in the world

218
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:35,228
- What about Mehru?
-I don't know

219
00:50:43,017 --> 00:50:45,121
Study well
You shouldn't procrastinate

220
00:50:53,494 --> 00:50:54,631
- Seena Mathew
- Hi

221
00:51:02,102 --> 00:51:03,330
The college looks good, right?

222
00:51:09,376 --> 00:51:12,880
"My heart is in pain, unable
to reach close to you"

223
00:51:20,521 --> 00:51:22,182
to speak to you next,

224
00:51:26,794 --> 00:51:30,218
Comrade Mehrunnisa Khaderkutty
from Kaattoorkadavu

225
00:51:39,239 --> 00:51:40,228
Namaste

226
00:51:49,349 --> 00:51:53,240
"You're a flowerthat blooms
on a branch far away"

227
00:51:59,393 --> 00:52:00,439
What is this, man?

228
00:52:19,379 --> 00:52:21,483
He has sense
He reads a lot

229
00:52:27,387 --> 00:52:28,433
I told you earlier, right?

230
00:52:28,689 --> 00:52:30,145
Mom, elder sister
& younger sister

231
00:52:55,949 --> 00:53:00,067
"As the rhythm of the red army,
As the flame of the red em ber"

232
00:53:05,225 --> 00:53:08,262
"You're like a shining star"

233
00:53:13,767 --> 00:53:17,100
"My heart is in pain, unable
to reach close to you"

234
00:53:22,576 --> 00:53:25,909
"You're like a shining star"

235
00:53:31,518 --> 00:53:35,147
"le heart is in pain, unableto reach you"

236
00:53:49,002 --> 00:53:51,960

 confined myself to my college
with my studies & welding

237
00:53:59,813 --> 00:54:00,802
Base calling for diver

238
00:54:25,806 --> 00:54:28,229
Returning back, following the umbilical
Over

239
00:54:46,493 --> 00:54:48,302
So this is your last
job before going home?

240
00:54:56,903 --> 00:54:57,801
Yeah

241
00:55:07,014 --> 00:55:09,847
Did you knoiAf? I've been asked
to dive from tomorrow

242
00:55:15,088 --> 00:55:16,976
Don't you know
that I can't do this?

243
00:55:24,731 --> 00:55:28,064
Hey! 
f
 wasn't scared of water,
I would havejumped into this water & died

244
00:55:36,109 --> 00:55:39,237
You know, once upon a time,
l was a classic tennis player

245
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:47,680
- Shall I go, dear?
- Excuse me

246
00:55:55,829 --> 00:55:57,433
lrinjalakkuda
Kaattoorkadavu

247
00:56:05,605 --> 00:56:10,702
a young man who can lead the dairy
dreams of Kaattoorkadavu from the front,

248
00:56:13,814 --> 00:56:16,271
No point, man!
You guys will lose!

249
00:56:23,390 --> 00:56:25,722
Mr SunimonArattukuzhy

250
00:56:32,933 --> 00:56:34,537
Respected voters,

251
00:56:34,835 --> 00:56:37,053
my dear dairy
farmers of Kaattoor,

252
00:56:45,078 --> 00:56:49,117
has ruined this society of ours

253
00:57:03,029 --> 00:57:05,953
this Khaderkutty is
a wolf in a goat skin

254
00:57:13,073 --> 00:57:14,734
Wolf in a goat skin
Say it

255
00:57:21,715 --> 00:57:25,219
So cast all your valuable
votes to this Ajayghosh...

256
00:57:39,666 --> 00:57:41,588
Muneerkka, this guy deserves our respect

257
00:57:49,576 --> 00:57:52,261
It's been 4 years since he went there
He would want to take so many things, right?

258
00:57:57,851 --> 00:57:59,830
He doesn't have to take this
He can buy this from his town

259
00:58:07,894 --> 00:58:10,374
By working hard under
waterfor these 4 years,

260
00:58:20,574 --> 00:58:22,622
It's been 5 years since
I started constructing my house

261
00:58:29,883 --> 00:58:31,771
Come directly to our house tomorrow

262
00:58:39,192 --> 00:58:42,059
Even though I'm late to come, things
are happening smoothly there, right?

263
00:58:50,270 --> 00:58:51,316
Muneer Koduvally

264
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:01,717
Temple-dweller?

265
00:59:25,272 --> 00:59:26,876
There's a limit for welding, man!

266
00:59:27,207 --> 00:59:29,926
lfthis doesn't get repaired, I'll have
to carry that bunch of grass on my head

267
00:59:35,949 --> 00:59:37,371
I like you as a fool

268
00:59:54,568 --> 00:59:57,526
When I saw you working, I thought you'll
be starting the car after engine repair!

269
01:00:15,355 --> 01:00:17,960
I think she wants you to
weld her scooter for free!

270
01:00:25,231 --> 01:00:27,301
I want to join Argentina fans club

271
01:00:34,107 --> 01:00:36,530
It's like Kuchela's thigh
which got hit by a mace

272
01:00:44,918 --> 01:00:46,055
Maryam Rashida

273
01:00:54,661 --> 01:00:56,549
Yeah, right! To change
the team fearing defeat,

274
01:01:04,204 --> 01:01:06,013
I said that I'll think
about it and let her know

275
01:01:13,079 --> 01:01:15,855
If we don't take her in,
she will join the Argentina fans at Tana

276
01:01:23,323 --> 01:01:25,837
Suni, get your vehicle
We have ajob to do

277
01:01:34,267 --> 01:01:35,279
What?

278
01:02:02,896 --> 01:02:05,672
When I'm talking, you're
listening to music?

279
01:02:10,236 --> 01:02:12,101
Heard me? Then why aren't you shocked?

280
01:02:19,846 --> 01:02:20,983
- We...
-You?

281
01:02:27,387 --> 01:02:29,127
Dude, tell me the truth

282
01:02:37,497 --> 01:02:39,237
Let me take it to my grave with me

283
01:02:46,506 --> 01:02:49,521
You Scoundrel!
You will never come up in life!

284
01:02:54,781 --> 01:02:57,113
You had to fightjust now!
You'll take it to your grave, it seems!

285
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:08,791
and who will write slogans
& poems to print on them?

286
01:03:24,978 --> 01:03:26,343
None ofthis was necessary

287
01:03:43,897 --> 01:03:44,852
You're as big as a bull!

288
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:56,024
Why are you scolding me, that
too in front of our kids?

289
01:04:12,425 --> 01:04:14,256
To get me scolded
Get lost!

290
01:04:21,467 --> 01:04:24,015
But still, to hate Brazil itself,

291
01:04:32,045 --> 01:04:34,730
Do we need such a person?
Isn't there an ethical issue in that?

292
01:04:41,221 --> 01:04:43,849
On second thoughts,
my opinion is that we should let herjoin

293
01:04:50,430 --> 01:04:55,311
And with them, there are four girls,
including Devi who goes to Kalamandalam

294
01:05:02,208 --> 01:05:04,017
- Is that even a fair reason?
- Isn't it?

295
01:05:10,917 --> 01:05:12,282
If she passes that,
we'll let herjoin

296
01:05:29,669 --> 01:05:31,910
When she chased him away,
Ajayghosh became the refugee, right?

297
01:05:37,977 --> 01:05:42,425
Vipinan, our Master would decide whether
to let her pass or fail in the interview!

298
01:05:57,597 --> 01:05:58,848
Mehru, right?

299
01:06:05,138 --> 01:06:08,596
A democratic interview
is going to happen here

300
01:06:24,490 --> 01:06:27,914
The President of Brazil fans, Ajayghosh?
He's a bourgeois rascal!

301
01:06:45,278 --> 01:06:47,291
The policies against
imperialism by Argentine...

302
01:06:56,589 --> 01:06:58,454
So our President Kirchner is a tigress!

303
01:07:05,598 --> 01:07:07,873
-What do we tell Vipinan nouf?
-I don't know

304
01:07:14,807 --> 01:07:18,846
Don't turn Argentina Fans Club into
a place to take out your personal grudges

305
01:07:23,349 --> 01:07:25,419
Didn't you just ask that?

306
01:07:33,793 --> 01:07:37,911
When she said some tongue
twisting foreign name,

307
01:07:41,167 --> 01:07:44,204
With that, our Master's tongue
got stuck in his throat

308
01:07:44,804 --> 01:07:48,194
We should have brought someone
from outside for the interview!

309
01:07:51,444 --> 01:07:54,242
Are the Brazil fans rascals
barking too much this time?

310
01:08:04,157 --> 01:08:05,294
She's so shy!

311
01:08:13,533 --> 01:08:14,488
Vam os!

312
01:08:22,442 --> 01:08:24,512
Get lost!
Don't talk such vulgar stuff!

313
01:08:32,351 --> 01:08:35,821
I mean, this is my first
bride-seeing ceremony, that's why...

314
01:08:41,127 --> 01:08:44,255
You must be waiting for someone
with good height like me, right?

315
01:09:10,223 --> 01:09:13,727
lfthe horoscopes match, Karthika's
wedding should be at Koodal Manikyam

316
01:09:20,333 --> 01:09:22,813
She got 4-5 marriage
proposals before this

317
01:09:30,843 --> 01:09:34,085
To protect our tradition,
faith and rituals,

318
01:09:49,595 --> 01:09:52,462
Dad, Brazil fans have a woofer
That's bigger than this

319
01:10:00,740 --> 01:10:01,604
AC?

320
01:10:11,217 --> 01:10:11,820
What?

321
01:10:20,226 --> 01:10:23,002
Not now, Dad
I'll take all that from you later

322
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:29,365
Hey! Where is your extension cable?

323
01:10:38,277 --> 01:10:39,608
What's this new programme?

324
01:10:47,353 --> 01:10:48,456
Let's think about it once more

325
01:10:56,596 --> 01:11:00,020
That is, 'Forthe mouth speaks
what the heart is full of'

326
01:11:03,035 --> 01:11:07,574
Basically, you will speak
only what's in your mind

327
01:11:15,881 --> 01:11:16,870
Mom!

328
01:11:24,724 --> 01:11:26,294
Oh my Neymar!

329
01:11:34,433 --> 01:11:35,684
Vamos Argentina!

330
01:11:43,576 --> 01:11:44,736
Alex Palliveedan

331
01:11:45,077 --> 01:11:47,318
He stayed at his mother's
house & studied engineering,

332
01:11:52,752 --> 01:11:57,109
No one in Kaattoor has understood why
Ajayghosh & Mehru split up, till date

333
01:11:59,625 --> 01:12:02,867
Anyway, one knot tightens
only when another gets loose

334
01:12:08,067 --> 01:12:11,434
Even though he was mocking me,
I like to believe that

335
01:12:28,654 --> 01:12:30,485
Only mint?
No smoke?

336
01:12:38,998 --> 01:12:41,068
My grandpa brought it from America

337
01:12:46,539 --> 01:12:50,543
Hey Alex! We, Brazil fans have been
maintaining a standard for ages

338
01:12:55,848 --> 01:12:56,712
That's correct

339
01:13:06,492 --> 01:13:08,653
Aren't you watching all the games then?
Only some games?

340
01:13:16,535 --> 01:13:18,105
- Messi?
-Yes

341
01:13:25,745 --> 01:13:28,168
This Palliveedan has a special
enmity towards traitors like her

342
01:13:35,121 --> 01:13:37,954
Look! There's your old friend
Alex!

343
01:13:45,698 --> 01:13:47,677
Shouldn't we place a bet again?

344
01:13:54,740 --> 01:13:55,695
Nice

345
01:14:03,849 --> 01:14:06,067
the Football World Cup
kicks off in Brazil

349
01:14:51,931 --> 01:14:55,492
What? You've been sitting there all alone
and idle for many years now, right?

350
01:15:12,785 --> 01:15:14,525
- Let's keep the flex there
- Come on

351
01:15:21,126 --> 01:15:22,696
Viva Brazil!

352
01:15:22,995 --> 01:15:25,566
Viva Brazil!

353
01:15:30,135 --> 01:15:31,864
Then we'll do one thing
We'll name it afteryou

01:16:33,933 --> 01:16:36,481
Yaay!
Boss, aren't you seeing this?

359
01:16:43,375 --> 01:16:45,741

excitement to us"

01:17:03,095 --> 01:17:03,823
CR!

362
01:17:12,938 --> 01:17:14,132
I'll show you now

363
01:17:22,214 --> 01:17:24,079
No?
That's gone

364
01:17:31,657 --> 01:17:34,376
Anthrukka, when we win against
Germany in the semi...

365
01:17:42,801 --> 01:17:44,610
- Load it
- Hold this

366
01:18:01,754 --> 01:18:03,563
Is it RDX instead of fire-crackers?

367
01:18:12,031 --> 01:18:15,455
Since I'm from a rich set-up...
Let the boys drink!

368
01:18:21,173 --> 01:18:23,915
Then you guys talk
Let me make a move

369
01:18:40,826 --> 01:18:43,477
Anthrukka, Neymar is
a strength for our team

370
01:18:51,870 --> 01:18:54,998
So when they lose, they can say that
they lost because Neymarwasn't there

371
01:19:15,928 --> 01:19:17,657
It's okay! We'll get it
We will win, man!

372
01:19:23,969 --> 01:19:26,745
- Isn't that a foul?
- That's a foul, no doubt

373
01:19:51,930 --> 01:19:54,091
Yaay! They have been beaten!

374
01:20:00,973 --> 01:20:03,692
Don't worry! The World Cup will come again
Stay strong

375
01:20:11,917 --> 01:20:12,667
We can!

376
01:20:19,591 --> 01:20:21,479
Looking at Mehru's face
is your problem, huh?

377
01:20:50,556 --> 01:20:52,717
Stop scratching your
head and go fast

378
01:21:10,075 --> 01:21:11,906
-Is he going to beat us up?
-Why?

379
01:21:21,053 --> 01:21:22,099
What do they want?

380
01:21:30,929 --> 01:21:31,975
It's not foolish, man!

381
01:21:50,349 --> 01:21:51,452
It's 7 Up!

382
01:22:25,217 --> 01:22:28,436
What if the whole village had Alzheimer's
and forgot everything by sunrise?

383
01:22:58,417 --> 01:23:00,055
That day, notjust Najeeb...

384
01:23:05,490 --> 01:23:09,460
But we beat Holland during
the shootout and entered the final

385
01:23:16,969 --> 01:23:18,391
It's looking great

386
01:23:26,645 --> 01:23:29,296
But have you seen Rosario
street earlier, Raghavetta?

387
01:23:35,654 --> 01:23:38,839
We're going to give Kaattoor
a blue dawn tomorrow!

388
01:23:46,098 --> 01:23:47,554
Then let's book St Antony's, Master

389
01:23:56,575 --> 01:23:59,635
You got lazy and slept off during every
PT period at the staff room,

390
01:24:07,352 --> 01:24:08,580
Here
Go and tie this

391
01:24:16,294 --> 01:24:18,103
My grandma is paralyzed

392
01:24:26,171 --> 01:24:27,866
this Vinod Aikkarakkundu...
Or leave it

393
01:24:44,089 --> 01:24:46,660
Oh no!
I'm trapped

394
01:24:55,300 --> 01:24:57,951
-You rascal!
- That's not me! (in Hindi)

395
01:25:30,102 --> 01:25:31,205
Hey Mehru...

396
01:25:37,142 --> 01:25:38,951
That's not going to
happen, Vipinan

397
01:26:02,534 --> 01:26:05,492
Isn't she feeling even
a bit of love towards me?

398
01:26:20,519 --> 01:26:23,317
Your younger sister is about
to be of marriageable age

399
01:26:28,660 --> 01:26:31,117
Those caste people you talked about
it long ago, would know that

400
01:26:38,370 --> 01:26:41,737
apart from a diploma certificate,
that too if you pass Polytechnic,

401
01:26:47,946 --> 01:26:49,368
Not just that...

402
01:26:57,589 --> 01:27:00,160
'Dear, you bit the hand that fed you milk!'

403
01:27:06,798 --> 01:27:09,278
Even if she loves you, she's
not going to confess that

404
01:27:16,875 --> 01:27:18,615
We will rock tomorrow's game!

405
01:27:26,618 --> 01:27:29,746
Instead of catching a cold sitting in
this temple ground, come home, Escobar

406
01:27:41,900 --> 01:27:44,004
(Football Commentary)

407
01:27:51,910 --> 01:27:53,923
You fool!
Thumbs up is given for good luck

408
01:27:59,284 --> 01:28:01,593
Dude, you coloured your hair?
Nice

409
01:28:07,659 --> 01:28:10,435
- Great!
- Suni, awesome!

410
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:02,874
Off-side!

411
01:30:02,107 --> 01:30:04,473
Don't cry
It's okay

412
01:30:11,483 --> 01:30:13,223
Okay! Let's burst some
small crackers decently

413
01:30:19,691 --> 01:30:20,851
That too, during extra time

414
01:30:26,631 --> 01:30:30,089
Didn't you see this?
I gave the barber 2000 Rupees!

415
01:30:45,550 --> 01:30:46,653
Thanks, dude

416
01:30:54,192 --> 01:30:56,990
All ofyou got such
sportsman spirit now, huh?

417
01:31:12,544 --> 01:31:15,229
Hey! Anyway you lost only
in the final, right?

418
01:31:22,854 --> 01:31:26,972
she stayed awake for the whole night
drinking black tea & mocked me non-stop

419
01:31:32,730 --> 01:31:36,234
We didn't have to think too much
about why no one was mocking us

420
01:31:42,707 --> 01:31:44,811
another organized fan club
was born for the first time

421
01:31:52,984 --> 01:31:54,713
Those guys were in our
team till yesterday

422
01:32:01,059 --> 01:32:03,573
This is a gameformen!

423
01:32:08,666 --> 01:32:11,794
Hey! Are you interested in
reducing my loneliness?

424
01:32:18,276 --> 01:32:20,346
- Messi who came after, also peed
- Bloody scoundrel!

425
01:32:27,819 --> 01:32:31,653
Messi who came after, also peed

426
01:32:35,059 --> 01:32:38,654
You haven't grown enough to defeat
the whites of Europe, you rascals!

427
01:32:44,202 --> 01:32:48,992
Neymar peed, Messi also peed!

428
01:32:52,710 --> 01:32:55,395
Hey Vipinan, she isn't shy
anymore after changing the team!

429
01:33:03,788 --> 01:33:05,619
He's not Palliveedan
He's a cheat

430
01:33:12,864 --> 01:33:14,320
neither did we become Brazil
fans because ofthem!

431
01:33:21,639 --> 01:33:23,368
- That's nice
-Yes, true

432
01:33:31,349 --> 01:33:32,714
What should I tell them?

433
01:33:38,690 --> 01:33:41,466
If you keep watching the World Cup and
go for work only once in a while,

434
01:33:51,803 --> 01:33:53,168
I'm asking you because
I don't know...

435
01:34:17,261 --> 01:34:20,298
if you want to blurt out your cliche
philosophy, don't open your mouth!

436
01:34:29,374 --> 01:34:33,788
When I was in my home-town, 
 used to go
to Church every morning, with my mother

437
01:34:49,661 --> 01:34:50,798
And 
...

438
01:34:59,804 --> 01:35:00,816
Still...

439
01:35:18,056 --> 01:35:19,068
Poor Christ

440
01:35:25,463 --> 01:35:29,581
Christ would have had atoughtime,
not being able to face my mother

441
01:35:47,218 --> 01:35:49,641
So, it was too bad that
you hurt your mother

442
01:35:56,060 --> 01:35:58,608
You had gone for an interview in
an agency in Kochi, right? -Yes

443
01:36:05,303 --> 01:36:08,693
I heard the postman saying this
at Sunnychettan's shop - Really?

444
01:36:15,480 --> 01:36:17,869
I won't stay in this
Kaattoor without you

445
01:36:24,388 --> 01:36:26,549
Hey! 
'

 ridethe bike
if you want me to

446
01:37:05,596 --> 01:37:09,339
She's a big shot in the party now
DYFK district vice president

447
01:37:27,118 --> 01:37:29,632
That's when Columbia is
going to win the World Cup

448
01:37:36,160 --> 01:37:38,845
To be frank, I really miss our Kaattoor

449
01:37:45,403 --> 01:37:47,587
Our village would have
changed a lot, right?

450
01:37:52,877 --> 01:37:55,448
-Are you going there like this?
-What's wrong with this?

451
01:37:55,947 --> 01:37:58,927
Shave that beard and go in
a presentable look, it's a wedding, right?

452
01:38:02,386 --> 01:38:06,299
And yeah, you should buy a packet of
Havana cigars from the duty free shop

453
01:38:42,093 --> 01:38:44,015
Technically, I'm not
from Kaattoor now, right?

454
01:39:01,245 --> 01:39:03,201
howl started rearing cows,

455
01:39:10,054 --> 01:39:13,945
even my parents alsojoined herto
go and say that in every house

456
01:39:18,362 --> 01:39:20,671
Even if you stand alone,
you're a colossal disaster...

457
01:39:21,098 --> 01:39:23,202
Why did you stand with
Ajayghosh, to lose again?

458
01:39:28,205 --> 01:39:30,366
and even the music troupe for
the wedding eve is ready

459
01:39:39,050 --> 01:39:41,325
Hey! You could have held
this next year, right?

460
01:39:46,524 --> 01:39:48,947
But the upcoming World
Cup won't wait

461
01:40:14,018 --> 01:40:15,212
Take that suitcase inside

462
01:40:23,494 --> 01:40:24,597
-Vipinan...
-What is this?

463
01:40:32,803 --> 01:40:34,498
What about the bouquet &
garland for tomorrouf?

464
01:40:40,778 --> 01:40:43,019
Mom, I haven't gotjasmine
flowers for my caryet

465
01:40:49,186 --> 01:40:51,404
- Namaste!
-Vipinan, you reached?

466
01:40:51,789 --> 01:40:54,269
I thought you'll skip this like
your elder sister's wedding

467
01:40:59,730 --> 01:41:01,709
She came quite early
Didn't you see her?

468
01:41:07,571 --> 01:41:10,119
"There's beauty all around"

469
01:41:16,547 --> 01:41:19,584
"Little flowers are turning red"

470
01:41:22,620 --> 01:41:27,592
"Yourwedding day is almost here"

471
01:41:34,532 --> 01:41:39,743
"The sweet feeling that flows
through the rhythms of life"

472
01:41:40,571 --> 01:41:45,759
"As a burning flame...
As a stunning bride..."

473
01:41:52,550 --> 01:41:57,761
"The eyes are locked with each other...
Someone is singing within your heart"

474
01:41:58,622 --> 01:42:03,070
"The full moon night is almost here"

475
01:42:10,601 --> 01:42:16,073
"The sweet feeling that flows

"The sweet feeling that flows
through the rhythms of life"

481
01:43:23,174 --> 01:43:26,826
l was busy with work, and then there's my
loan and this wedding, you know, right?

482
01:43:41,792 --> 01:43:43,976
we have to find a sweet,
innocent girl for you

483
01:44:02,213 --> 01:44:04,022
Ali came and proposed to me...

484
01:44:09,620 --> 01:44:12,339
l have to get married sometime or
the other, right? Sol said okay

485
01:44:18,796 --> 01:44:20,024
Okay then
See you tomorrow

486
01:44:20,297 --> 01:44:21,582
Shall we go?
See you

487
01:44:46,023 --> 01:44:47,388
it's her wedding the next day

488
01:44:57,401 --> 01:45:00,006
The groom is a PhD
fellowfrom Hyderabad

489
01:45:15,452 --> 01:45:18,467
Boss, will I die of a shock
before Portugal wins the cup?

490
01:45:28,098 --> 01:45:29,497
Get lost, Sunikkuttan!

491
01:45:46,583 --> 01:45:48,631
And not because you got fed up
of washing your wife's clothes?

492
01:45:56,593 --> 01:45:57,844
Tie it up, man!

493
01:46:06,837 --> 01:46:08,168
Member, look

494
01:46:15,479 --> 01:46:17,435
We, German fans, who are
the World champions,

495
01:46:24,922 --> 01:46:27,083
Don't you know that this place is
for us this time, Palliveedan?

496
01:46:35,366 --> 01:46:37,095
Swearing at my dad?
Rascal...

497
01:47:10,601 --> 01:47:11,670
- Get going
- I'll see you later!

498
01:47:20,043 --> 01:47:21,328
Then why did you
swear at his father?

499
01:47:30,220 --> 01:47:32,461
Hey! The boys also got beaten up
Order tea for them too

500
01:47:39,129 --> 01:47:40,585
You guys are making me mad!

501
01:47:48,539 --> 01:47:50,268
I didn't know that a fight happened

502
01:47:59,116 --> 01:48:01,277
Vipinan, that member would
give them that place,

503
01:48:07,758 --> 01:48:09,305
You are smart, man!

504
01:48:16,600 --> 01:48:19,342
Even though I have to take some effort,
I have peace of mind

505
01:48:27,911 --> 01:48:29,367
Leave it, man

506
01:48:29,680 --> 01:48:31,602
Do you give all this
milk to the society?

507
01:48:38,989 --> 01:48:42,231
Mom told me that the groom's family
is coming tomorrow to meet Mehru

508
01:48:48,665 --> 01:48:50,678
Sincel didn't know how to ask,
I left it

509
01:48:57,140 --> 01:48:59,279
Leave all that
Shouldn't we tie the flex tomorrouf?

510
01:49:05,816 --> 01:49:07,886
We should do something and
get the boys on our side

511
01:49:16,226 --> 01:49:18,365
My life would get over
in this cow-shed, man!

512
01:49:25,202 --> 01:49:27,272
Only some of our
neighbours are here

513
01:49:34,044 --> 01:49:36,558
Mehru grew up in their house

514
01:49:40,150 --> 01:49:44,098
Sometime back, when a fight happened
in Christ college during SFK's march,

515
01:49:51,962 --> 01:49:54,328
She was engaged in party
activities full time

516
01:50:09,713 --> 01:50:12,728
Take some selfies and put them up
on our page, let everyone see it!

517
01:50:34,705 --> 01:50:37,037
- Scoundrels! They got scared
-Ask them to get lost

518
01:50:53,657 --> 01:50:55,136
They are trying to mess with Nazis!

519
01:51:03,934 --> 01:51:05,094
Not Dollars, dude

520
01:51:12,643 --> 01:51:14,804
There would be at least
10,000 Dirhams in this now

521
01:51:23,086 --> 01:51:24,565
- Really?
-Yes

522
01:51:31,928 --> 01:51:34,089
What?
What the hell are you saying?

523
01:53:06,022 --> 01:53:08,445
Shouldn't we also erect
a cut out of CR 7 like this?

524
01:53:16,333 --> 01:53:19,313
get passports, go to the Middle East,
work hard and make money like him,

525
01:53:46,263 --> 01:53:47,571
Hey! Don't cry

526
01:53:55,038 --> 01:53:56,551
-Anthrukka!
- Hey!

527
01:55:12,482 --> 01:55:15,542
"Lord Ganesha Son of Lord Shiva
Bless us, let ourwish get succeeded"

528
01:55:30,033 --> 01:55:32,513
'If you can, will you try to stop
this cup from his hard kick'

529
01:56:24,321 --> 01:56:26,653
I'm also thinking about going to
my uncle's house in Thrissur

530
01:56:36,032 --> 01:56:36,817
What?

531
01:56:46,142 --> 01:56:47,063
Here
Hold this

532
01:56:55,652 --> 01:56:57,461
Ajayan, look at Vipinan
sitting there

533
01:57:04,327 --> 01:57:07,125
After all, it's the land where revolution
was born, as Mehru always says

534
01:57:15,805 --> 01:57:18,228
- Go and switch on that TV
- Go!

535
01:57:24,014 --> 01:57:26,812
Since Argentina had to squeeze in somehow,
our excitement levels were low

536
01:57:53,376 --> 01:57:55,264
Absolute genius

537
01:58:39,556 --> 01:58:42,354
Even ifArgentina gets a
draw against Nigeria today,

538
01:58:48,331 --> 01:58:52,665
Or will they rise from the ashes?
That question booms around!

539
01:58:56,539 --> 01:58:58,757
This is like Emperor
Shahjahan playing the Veena,

540
01:59:06,249 --> 01:59:08,319
Can't you stop yourself from
correcting me at least once?

541
01:59:16,392 --> 01:59:18,280
If we lose tomorrow's game,

542
01:59:35,879 --> 01:59:39,269
I thought that she would tell me that she
loves me, at least during the last moment

543
01:59:44,387 --> 01:59:47,106
Or, maybe because she doesn't
want to hurt my mother

544
01:59:54,297 --> 01:59:55,400
l have lost, man!

545
02:00:01,604 --> 02:00:04,061
finally, inthe reality show called life,

546
02:00:10,947 --> 02:00:13,575
Do you know what makes me
sadderthan her wedding?

547
02:00:21,791 --> 02:00:23,338
I made it up on my own

548
02:00:32,468 --> 02:00:33,628
What did I say?

549
02:00:42,445 --> 02:00:43,366
After the game?

550
02:00:51,688 --> 02:00:53,087
Should I look for brides?

551
02:01:09,606 --> 02:01:12,211
Do as you please, mom
Whatever it is, lam fine

552
02:01:37,267 --> 02:01:38,552
Hannah, no need of all this

553
02:01:45,708 --> 02:01:48,541
Embracing the tradition is also a pure
leftist way, Comrade

554
02:02:06,729 --> 02:02:07,684
Leave that

555
02:02:26,849 --> 02:02:29,090
He was really sad when he
left from our house today

556
02:02:35,625 --> 02:02:39,368
If you both had such a wish, did you
think that anyone would object to it?

557
02:02:49,505 --> 02:02:53,100
Did you think that I would say that
you bit the hands that fed you milk?

558
02:03:01,384 --> 02:03:04,217
But the happiness of my children
is more important for me!

559
02:03:16,532 --> 02:03:17,635

"The wedding will happen at sunrise"

No one will burst crackers
here to celebrate our loss

575
02:06:51,380 --> 02:06:54,599
If you fulfill all your wishes
in life, what thrill would remain?

576
02:06:58,955 --> 02:07:00,764
I never wished for too
much in life, Escobar

577
02:07:08,130 --> 02:07:09,495
Another wish...

578
02:07:14,937 --> 02:07:19,681
have you ever heard this Vipinan saying
anything else as a wish or even a greed?

579
02:07:25,715 --> 02:07:27,671
lam all alone

580
02:08:32,848 --> 02:08:34,577
We will
Don't worry

581
02:09:27,103 --> 02:09:28,240
Vam os!

582
02:10:02,271 --> 02:10:04,000
Vipinan! Vipinan!

583
02:10:27,096 --> 02:10:29,781
Come on! We have work to do!

584
02:10:35,538 --> 02:10:37,961
Argentina!

585
02:10:53,923 --> 02:10:56,437
- ls Mehru with you?
- She is here, I'll put her on

586
02:11:00,362 --> 02:11:03,104
- Dad...
-What have you done, dear?

587
02:11:11,340 --> 02:11:14,764
my heart will be as heavy as a rock,
till the end of my life

588
02:11:28,023 --> 02:11:30,742
Khaderkka, don't think that I'm
finding faults at this time

589
02:11:45,174 --> 02:11:49,736
howthe hell will I find new cooks to cook
a veg feast for them, at this midnight?

02:13:23,238 --> 02:13:24,307
I don't want it

When you have kids, will you give
them Hindu names or Muslim names?

601

If it's a boy, the name is already fixed

602
02:15:07,076 --> 02:15:09,294
Andres Leo...

02:15:23,592 --> 02:15:25,548
ljust hope things end
happily for my team as well
