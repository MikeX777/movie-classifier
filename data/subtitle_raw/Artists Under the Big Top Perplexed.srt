1
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,793
<i>Office party.</i>

2
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,231
<i>A pretty blonde, rather plump.</i>

3
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,591
<i>She only had short affairs,</i>

4
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,871
<i>for she was mean and passive.</i>

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,709
<i>Then she was stroking my hair.</i>

6
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,799
<i>I saw a tenderness in her eyes</i>

7
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,470
<i>which I knew to be love.</i>

8
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,749
NOW THEY'VE REACHED THE TOP.

9
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,760
BUT THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO NEXT.

10
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,953
HARD WORK IS USELESS IN ITSELF.

11
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,039
ARTISTS IN THE BIG TOP: PERPLEXED

12
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,155
1. MOURNING WORK:

13
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,714
DAY OF GERMAN ART 1939

14
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,071
<i>He gave joy to many,</i>
<i>young and old.</i>

15
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:51,752
<i>Millions of them.</i>
<i>Who will weep for him now?</i>

16
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:58,837
2. MOURNING WORK: MANFRED PEICKERT

17
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,834
<i>Manfred Peickert is a circus artist.</i>
<i>He has plans.</i>

18
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:12,837
I say, "Couldn't we hoist up the
elephants right over the ring?"

19
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,512
And the director says, "Of course,
but would the roof hold up?"

20
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:21,157
I say,
"It would be something quite new."

21
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,832
He says, "New?
I think it's strange and irrational."

22
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,316
I say, "Something has to burst.

23
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,479
What if they went up
with a balloon?"

24
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,194
The director says,
"I think it's too irrational."

25
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,155
But I say,
"The effect would be great."

26
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,440
<i>"Genius is the capacity</i>
<i>for endless effort."</i>

27
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,314
<i>Success was the main goal</i>
<i>for the Peickerts.</i>

28
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,069
<i>Four generations of chemists.</i>

29
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,873
<i>But in their enslaved souls</i>

30
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,357
<i>something said,</i>
<i>"If we've been made slaves,</i>

31
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,759
<i>it would be unwise</i>
<i>to give us weapons."</i>

32
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,953
<i>In 1945, Manfred Peickert</i>
<i>went to Australia to sell oil.</i>

33
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,393
<i>But that wasn't a new world either.</i>
<i>He joined a circus.</i>

34
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,750
I think it would be wonderful
to have the elephants

35
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:37,593
hanging up in the big top
to help build up the show.

36
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,835
I can't put it better than that.

37
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,950
<i>"HE WHO RISKS NOTHING</i>

38
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,516
<i>SHALL NEVER WIN."</i>

39
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,959
<i>Countess Fanny Ghika</i>
<i>of the Imperial Circus</i>

40
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,551
<i>had herself trampled</i>
<i>by horses every day,</i>

41
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,198
<i>to rise again</i>
<i>and be cheered by the crowd.</i>

42
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,952
HE WANTS TO BE A CLOWN.

43
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,356
TO GO AROUND MAKING THE SKY TREMBLE

44
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,755
WITH HIS TRUMPET,

45
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,155
AND BE WITH WOMEN

46
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,919
LIKE A REAL MAN SHOULD.

47
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,911
<i>Leo Uffland worked on his</i>
<i>astronaut trick for 14 years.</i>

48
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,512
<i>He was to appear in a spaceship.</i>
<i>He died in an accident.</i>

49
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,077
<i>The remains of his contraption</i>
<i>are useless.</i>

50
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:03,833
<i>Sojkowsky survived dozens of</i>
<i>snake bites and died in the ring.</i>

51
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:08,512
<i>He worked with 20 poisonous snakes</i>
<i>and a non-poisonous boa.</i>

52
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:26,199
<i>Sojkowsky will do his hanging trick</i>
<i>for the first time ever.</i>

53
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,073
<i>He'd kicked away the chair.</i>

54
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,875
<i>After 2 minutes he was lifted down.</i>

55
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,039
<i>The iron noose had strangled him.</i>

56
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:41,273
<i>"Like the sword of Damocles, the hour</i>
<i>of my death looms, and I am hurrying."</i>

57
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,109
I sailed off and went to...

58
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,519
I went to...
any old city... to Sydney.

59
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,998
I went looking for something,
I don't know what...

60
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,273
I never found it, but then

61
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,631
maybe it wasn't anything definite.

62
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,992
I turn a somersault to the high bar,

63
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,635
and then back again to the platform.

64
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,595
That's all.

65
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,154
It's a funny act, really.

66
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,511
<i>One day</i>
<i>he goes up on the high bars again.</i>

67
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,599
<i>He puts magnesium powder on his hands.</i>

68
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,600
<i>His adrenalin starts to flow.</i>

69
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,671
<i>He is overcome by melancholy.</i>

70
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,954
<i>He misses his partner's hand,</i>
<i>and breaks his neck.</i>

71
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,239
<i>Death is the negation of time.</i>
<i>Lust desires eternity.</i>

72
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,911
<i>They had reached the top.</i>

73
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,670
<i>But then they didn't know</i>
<i>what to do next.</i>

74
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,350
<i>Hard work is useless in itself.</i>

75
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,758
Leni Peickert, Manfred's heiress.

76
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,673
Where is it?

77
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:01,792
For the following 'double passage',
we would like to ask

78
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,958
for your kind attention.

79
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:10,672
<i>The trapeze artist,</i>
<i>whose 5th husband shot the 4th,</i>

80
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,156
<i>threw herself onto the body and cried,</i>

81
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,718
<i>"I will avenge this,</i>
<i>or not be able to bear it.</i>

82
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,674
<i>But I'll have forgotten it in a week.</i>

83
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,597
<i>Fire in the Chicago elephant-house.</i>
<i>"Alarm! Fire!"</i>

84
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,871
<i>The director: "It isn't a real fire."</i>

85
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,278
<i>The pachyderms are getting desperate.</i>

86
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:40,838
<i>"Freedom", said one of the elephants,</i>
<i>"is risking one's life.</i>

87
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,953
<i>Not because it's freedom from slavery,</i>

88
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,278
<i>but because human freedom is defined</i>

89
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:52,396
<i>by its negative relation to others."</i>

90
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,991
<i>The elephants swear,</i>
<i>"We forget nothing."</i>

91
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:12,675
<i>"A wounded mind heals without scars,</i>
<i>but a wounded body poisons the mind."</i>

92
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,758
<i>The elephants swear,</i>
<i>"We forget nothing."</i>

93
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,153
<i>An adult elephant is one</i>
<i>that knows its enemy.</i>

94
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,195
<i>The one who doesn't protect him</i>
<i>in order to exploit him.</i>

95
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,436
<i>The elephants swear,</i>
<i>"We forget nothing."</i>

96
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,031
<i>We won't forget the firemen</i>
<i>and the director</i>

97
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,553
<i>who said, "It is just a fake!"</i>
<i>It wasn't fake, but a real fire.</i>

98
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:05,157
<i>Truly, the day is near,</i>

99
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,718
<i>The end of the Hitler-state.</i>

100
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,675
<i>Happy is the one, who'll still</i>

101
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:18,398
<i>Be alive by then.</i>

102
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,958
<i>The fascists who burn</i>
<i>should be thrown into the sea.</i>

103
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,437
<i>Even those who don't burn</i>
<i>or extinguish should be packed</i>

104
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,793
<i>and thrown into the sea.</i>
<i>We should also throw</i>

105
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,198
<i>our memories of the fire and</i>
<i>our suffering into the sea.</i>

106
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,792
<i>Or revenge.</i>
<i>He affected by revenge will be shot.</i>

107
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,676
<i>Rather shoot than forget.</i>
<i>Better to throw them into the sea.</i>

108
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,756
<i>We should throw</i>
<i>our memories of the fire</i>

109
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,430
<i>and our suffering, into the sea.</i>

110
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,755
<i>It's better to throw them</i>
<i>into the sea.</i>

111
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,993
<i>Leni Peickert wants her own circus.</i>

112
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,514
<i>She imagines herself</i>
<i>opening her own circus.</i>

113
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,758
<i>A circus worthy of a dead man.</i>

114
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,189
<i>She watches the performance</i>
<i>of a leading circus.</i>

115
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,279
<i>She wants nothing but the best.</i>

116
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:38,158
<i>Leni Peickert says, "I'll change</i>
<i>the circus, because I love it."</i>

117
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:44,152
<i>Answer: "She loves it,</i>
<i>so she won't change it. Why?</i>

118
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,558
<i>Because love is conservative."</i>

119
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:51,159
<i>Leni Peickert: "That isn't true!"</i>

120
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:10,636
<i>She says to a famous tamer,</i>
<i>"I plan to open my own circus."</i>

121
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,670
<i>The tamer:</i>
<i>"I'd be happy if you did."</i>

122
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,998
<i>Leni Peickert:</i>
<i>"I want the animals to act authentic".</i>

123
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,557
<i>The tamer: "They're only authentic</i>
<i>in the jungle."</i>

124
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,358
<i>Leni Peickert says: "I read about</i>
<i>so-called Evil. Change your mind!"</i>

125
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,992
Let it rise... to the level of

126
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,956
great ideas.
Not just doing what the market wants,

127
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,153
but really... doing what you want.

128
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,838
I want to start my own business.

129
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,396
Do you already have an idea?

130
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,958
<i>Ms. Anna Fedorjewna Saizeva,</i>
<i>of the Russian ministry of culture,</i>

131
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:56,157
<i>is on a tour of Western Europe.</i>
<i>Leni Peickert hopes to get some help.</i>

132
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,398
We already met in Salerno,
2 years ago.

133
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,752
I was fascinated by your lecture,

134
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,431
you spoke about
the lion on horseback.

135
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,829
What side are you on? Are you
for the military kind of dressage?

136
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:18,831
It's funny, certain circus words are
the same in different languages:

137
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:23,990
"Big top", "artiste"...I could...

138
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,559
Could you lend me some artists?
Just temporarily?

139
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,959
I plan to start my own business,
and I would be very grateful

140
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,439
if you could lend me a few artists.
For a time.

141
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:45,556
They were a charming couple,
aged about 30, highly intelligent.

142
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,039
I'd never believed ballet-dancers
could be intelligent.

143
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:56,476
And then the organizer said to me,

144
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:00,037
"I don't know why,
everything was all right.

145
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,835
Good service, waiters in tailcoats,

146
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:08,559
and the stripper
was a party member since 1917."

147
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,951
Leni Peickert needs money
to realize her plans.

148
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:30,349
She's prepared to compromise,
and signs a television contract.

149
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:40,312
Dad, how are you? - I'm okay.
It's a bit wretched, but I'll manage.

150
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,198
Come on. Lola! Sascha!

151
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,315
Girls!

152
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,198
You keep on walking.
Of course, while you're walking.

153
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:16,552
He passes you and the camera follows.

154
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,155
Mr Müller?
- Phone is on.

155
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,397
71-70-1st.

156
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,796
It's the first time
Carlo drank too much.

157
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:38,471
The last time was when
Tim was born.

158
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,071
I brought you a drink.
- Thank you

159
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,389
How long will this take?

160
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,796
We rushed here today...

161
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,079
They don't need any circus artists.

162
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,637
They're all actors playing the roles.

163
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,956
WE SEEK ARTISTS FOR TOURS OF EUROPE

164
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,356
AND OVERSEAS. PLEASE CONTACT US.

165
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,919
A shirt, open here

166
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:45,393
and this side, or that one?

167
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,829
And here... pearls.

168
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,715
Open here, and here...

169
00:28:55,160 --> 00:29:00,359
pearls... and two stars. All right?

170
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,678
Two stars here.

171
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,910
Good day.
- Good day.

172
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,112
I saw your advertisement.

173
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,996
We can use anyone who's willing.
- That's me.

174
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,911
You must have an open mind, of course.
- I know. What is it, exactly?

175
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:24,071
Troop entertainment.
Morocco, Libya, Thailand and Saigon.

176
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:27,193
What's new about it?
- We have an extra attraction.

177
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,837
The artists drop pamphlets
from high up in the big top.

178
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:35,239
Saying what? - Peace.
- Peace in general? - Yes.

179
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,558
What we need is something funny.

180
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,754
That's hard on the trapeze. - Our
boys' peace-making efforts increase

181
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,193
their need for entertainment.
- This is what I can offer.

182
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,030
I don't know it, but here it is again.

183
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,948
A sawmill owner orders 5 beers.

184
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,197
Have you seen my toothbrush?

185
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,154
Someone please open the tram door!

186
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,557
A mouse running on a hot stove.

187
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:15,118
Imagine it high up in the big top
with red spotlights.

188
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:20,031
Haven't you got anything funny?
Something special?

189
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,471
Haven't you got a shirt...

190
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:28,711
open here,
with some pearls and two stars...

191
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,789
Should I bring my own money, too?
- We can't pay much, really,

192
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,913
but this is about ethical values.

193
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,510
"Then I'll go to Maxim's"

194
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:20,350
<i>The violin sweetly sings good-night</i>

195
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:28,475
<i>Your heart has turned off the light</i>

196
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:36,429
<i>A last kiss on your lips</i>
<i>And the song is over...</i>

197
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,793
Mr von Lüptow talks about "The
situation of the circus artist today."

198
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:46,919
...afterwards they rode horses again.
World War Il: 2 of the Blumenfeldts

199
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,999
near Orel, 1942. They thought

200
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:55,994
they could fight inhumanity
if all the artists in the world

201
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,398
raised their standards simultaneously.

202
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,589
THE FRENCHMAN DIES SMILING,
THE AVIATEUR CRASHES SMILING.

203
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:34,750
JUST THINK OF A KISSING MOUTH:
OF YOURS, TRAVIATA.

204
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,675
I only study pieces...

205
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,350
I shouldn't do exercises, just play

206
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:30,112
the difficult parts of those pieces.

207
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,548
Facing this inhuman situation,
the artist's only recourse is to

208
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,470
raise his standards still higher.

209
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,799
Leni Peickert visits
her friend Dr Busch.

210
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,116
Tell me something.

211
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,195
Come on.

212
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,790
Some people kept an alligator
in an aquarium.

213
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:51,118
The alligator grew bigger,

214
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:54,552
but they didn't put him
into a bigger aquarium.

215
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,959
He became bigger and bigger,
and eventually grew square.

216
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,074
I can't imagine that.

217
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,954
It's a cruel story.

218
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,278
We grow in our cage too.

219
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:20,432
But we didn't grow square, see.

220
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,110
I'm used to Dr Busch.

221
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:26,120
I've known him since I was 14.

222
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:31,434
He lured me to his room
and gave me an apple.

223
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,552
Then he said he was sleepy,

224
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,560
and insisted I lie on the bed too.

225
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,798
He stroked my hair
and asked if I liked it.

226
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:43,994
I said yes, to be polite.
I said, "What if I cry out?"

227
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:47,830
He opened his fly
and told me to look.

228
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:52,432
I said I wasn't interested,
I'd seen the like before.

229
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,638
Our education was all illusion,

230
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,435
illusion and hope.

231
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:09,759
And how disappointed we were!
And where are we now?

232
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,159
Just employees in the economy!

233
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:18,991
We just have small tasks
without any responsibility.

234
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,910
You don't know how hard it is to work

235
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:26,477
without being able
to determine what you want.

236
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,309
For what? Nobody knows.

237
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,637
Why indeed?

238
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:36,358
Yes... in the past, we thought

239
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,952
we could change things,
make things better...

240
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,595
Make life more human.

241
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,109
Stop it all.

242
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,233
We created a bouquet:
The attention-values for women.

243
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,989
Flowers are top of the list.

244
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,352
Then soap...
- No, babies first,

245
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,156
they all love babies,
and then flowers second.

246
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,755
And what comes last?

247
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,079
That's why we use babies and flowers
in our ads for females.

248
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,238
And all mothers love babies?

249
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,116
It's crazy.
About 80% attention-value.

250
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:23,599
For instance,
Santa Claus as a child

251
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:29,319
giving a box of cigars,
gets 70% attention-value.

252
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,672
Without the child
it would be 30 or 40%.

253
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:38,752
They go crazy for flowers, too.
So it's flowers and babies.

254
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:45,032
We'll make some flower...
- Tell me more. - Flower fertilizer.

255
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,756
A brand of artificial fertilizer:
"Dr Happiness".

256
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,555
We bought the name "Dr Happiness".

257
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,873
"Dr Happiness!"
It calls on the mother-instinct,

258
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,072
gives it an outlet.

259
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,072
I discovered it.

260
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,029
The opera ball, 1968.

261
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:15,110
Leni Peickert wants to meet the friends
and promoters of her enterprises.

262
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:51,557
<i>Mr Donndorf, assistant secretary,</i>
<i>ministry of education and the arts.</i>

263
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:09,674
As Mosca, he is...
it's really the wrong role for him.

264
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:14,398
He can't help it.
- Totally wrong. He can't help it.

265
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:18,958
It's hard to find
a young actor to do

266
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:25,157
a convincing Ferdinand...
it's actually a stupid part.

267
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:29,479
Hardly playable. - Hardly playable.
And yet he is convincing.

268
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:36,473
Yes, it's due to
some sort of electric impulse...

269
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,753
Ammonia and methane

270
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:44,591
could produce living matter

271
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:48,828
like protein cells and so on

272
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,955
with a strong electric discharge

273
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,470
such as lightning.

274
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,388
The earth was once like Jupiter.

275
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:01,912
So one could reasonably assume,

276
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:05,113
although conditions are not the same,

277
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:08,154
that in millions of years

278
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:12,036
Jupiter will have
an atmosphere like ours.

279
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,436
"Dr Happiness in danger"

280
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:20,950
<i>St. Petersburg, around 1900.</i>
<i>100 horses going in a circle.</i>

281
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,392
<i>But happiness is gone,</i>
<i>disappeared.</i>

282
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,439
<i>Accountant Lotte Losemeyer</i>
<i>often criticized</i>

283
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:35,077
<i>the bad management by her boss,</i>
<i>a building contractor.</i>

284
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,750
<i>Fortunately, she won't give in.</i>

285
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:43,748
<i>She takes 156,000 DM from the safe</i>
<i>and decides to destroy it.</i>

286
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,351
It's a shame about that nice money.

287
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:20,279
Even this is more hard work
than satisfaction.

288
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:45,829
One must take it out again
and throw it back.

289
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:10,275
<i>Forgive the woman, for you would</i>
<i>do the same if you'd her troubles.</i>

290
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:16,350
Leni Peickert wants
to make even more effort.

291
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:40,513
<i>Leni Peickert says,</i>

292
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:44,032
<i>"I just need</i>
<i>love for my work to go on.</i>

293
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:48,553
<i>That's what makes</i>
<i>poor Nolde do his deeds."</i>

294
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:19,957
<i>Interesting sexual problems</i>
<i>with space travel.</i>

295
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,151
<i>Disinclination grows</i>
<i>out of proportion,</i>

296
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,352
<i>but love can't be accumulated.</i>

297
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:31,635
<i>An astronaut who was</i>
<i>in hospital for a post-flight check,</i>

298
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:36,312
<i>filled a bottle with semen</i>
<i>when he saw a nurse go by.</i>

299
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:41,197
A vessel containing about 1 cc,

300
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,551
like a small vase.

301
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,709
It's a rather unlikely
that he'd fill such a vessel...

302
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:53,197
It's a hospital urine-flask,
with a long neck...

303
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,509
The story's exaggerated
just to emphasize the point.

304
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:19,110
<i>She treated the lion-tamer Mackensen</i>
<i>to dinner in a restaurant.</i>

305
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:23,553
<i>Leni Peickert admired</i>
<i>the tamer excessively.</i>

306
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,877
...they can even whistle.

307
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:29,118
I'd like to build a great aquarium.

308
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:32,677
<i>"Could we let a child</i>
<i>play with dolphins?"</i>

309
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:35,793
<i>"It'd be too dangerous", he says.</i>

310
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,468
<i>Leni Peickert:</i>

311
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:41,913
<i>"Then I can't hire you.</i>
<i>One has to take risks."</i>

312
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,588
<i>"Dear lady...</i>

313
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,713
<i>Dear lady, please be sensible."</i>

314
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,639
My dolphins...

315
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:52,355
<i>"Don't... don't be like that."</i>

316
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:57,749
They can jump
up to 6 metres, maybe more.

317
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:03,750
Well, I'm sure you'll find
something to fit in later on.

318
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:06,834
I had a moment of clarity.

319
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:11,796
The police...
I can't remember a thing,

320
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:15,710
except that I was lying in bed
the next day...

321
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,913
lying in bed, and...

322
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:26,352
I felt a pain...

323
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,636
It hurt... I had a swollen hand...

324
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:34,753
terribly swollen...

325
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:41,749
then I found the note in my pocket.

326
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:12,559
A 500 km drive,
just for a Sunday with Dr Busch.

327
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:20,878
<i>If you sit, then sit.</i>
<i>If you walk, then walk.</i>

328
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:23,550
<i>If you talk, then talk.</i>

329
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:29,755
<i>Leni Peickert realizes she can't</i>
<i>unite art and free enterprise.</i>

330
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:34,116
<i>Only as a capitalist</i>
<i>can one change things.</i>

331
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:45,948
She buys an elephant.

332
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:55,956
She rented an animal enclosure
to wait for the season.

333
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:06,593
The business swallows money.
She asks Mr von Lüptow for a loan.

334
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:17,231
She hired Mr von Lüptow
as her deputy.

335
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:39,399
<i>Be watchful, be watchful!</i>

336
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:41,949
Come sit around me, and listen.

337
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:54,593
Gitti Bornemann meets
her friend, Leni Peickert.

338
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:07,430
Von Lüptow hears too late
that she's a millionairess.

339
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:11,793
Leni Peickert forbids him
to ask her for a loan.

340
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:17,034
Mr Böhme, I'll put it clearly.

341
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:21,155
I can't pay back
the 8,000 DM right now.

342
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,556
I don't have it.

343
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:28,511
I don't understand.

344
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:32,154
I don't understand what you said.

345
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:35,309
And if you can't give a guarantee,

346
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:39,310
I'll have to back out.

347
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:45,073
What do you mean?
- I can't just take your word.

348
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:50,548
The world's full of people
who make promises they can't keep.

349
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,356
8,000 DM is no small matter.

350
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:57,880
Give me six months grace.

351
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:02,871
Six months is a lifetime,
one can die in six months.

352
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:06,150
It's a very long eternity.

353
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:11,873
I understand, but...

354
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:17,917
<i>She borrows from the large banks</i>
<i>to pay off the small banks.</i>

355
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:22,194
The bank wants a total guarantee

356
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:26,553
for the money it spends.
Your animals are no guarantee.

357
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,390
You can't ask the bank to open a zoo

358
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:34,628
and keep them until you can pay.

359
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:40,279
As a banking counsellor he can't
act like a simple cashier.

360
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:43,439
No ordinary cashier
can do that anyway.

361
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:49,318
There must be a way, Mr Wiese!

362
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:56,036
There might be many ways,
but I can't name any right now.

363
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:00,439
<i>"If a capitalist does what he loves</i>
<i>instead of what he needs,</i>

364
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,950
<i>he won't be supported</i>
<i>by that which is."</i>

365
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:31,480
Look, if I get involved
in your problem...

366
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:35,833
Tell me how to analyze...
what to do...

367
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:39,955
First, you have to
establish your target group:

368
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:43,472
A) regular spectators

369
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:47,549
b) occasional spectators

370
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,959
c) people who never go to a circus.
Then...

371
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:56,188
People who never go?
- Their views are interesting.

372
00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:00,952
What about television?
- Later on, it's irrelevant now.

373
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:04,358
But why?
- It's a competing medium. It is...

374
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:07,234
I could add
theatre and film to the circus.

375
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:11,912
Yes, but the circus on television...

376
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:13,998
We know that the circus

377
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:17,956
is interesting in itself.

378
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:24,799
But visiting a circus is inconvenient.

379
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:27,549
You have to dress up, it costs 16 DM,

380
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,230
you have to sit on a bench...

381
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:34,830
It costs money, the wooden bench.

382
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:38,556
You have to plan it...

383
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,993
so circus on television is easier.

384
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:47,194
That's why people rather watch a
circus on television than a real one.

385
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:49,596
But now back to the target group.

386
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:55,478
Maybe I could do
an African act with my elephants.

387
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:58,388
That's implausible.

388
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:03,356
Because a circus elephant
is viewed differently...

389
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:06,075
I already told you:

390
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:09,432
What counts for ideas, products

391
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:14,476
objects, people, animals
is their social background.

392
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:01,589
First modern circus: Astley in Paris.

393
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:04,634
Time: The French Revolution.

394
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:08,038
The artists: Astonishing.

395
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:12,758
There isn't a thing
the New Revolutionary Man can't do.

396
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:19,832
Then our sensational finale:
The Submarine Circus!

397
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:22,032
Delightful fountains.

398
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:24,835
Illuminated cascades.

399
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:28,436
Revolving stars above.

400
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:31,719
Soft music and the splashing of water.

401
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:34,674
Lights on, the ring is filled

402
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:37,873
with water with ducks swimming,

403
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:42,598
a boat and toy fish.
And then our comedy.

404
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:08,398
<i>The great Danish clown Olchansky.</i>

405
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:16,909
<i>He was successful,</i>

406
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:20,238
<i>went to China, buried his child,</i>

407
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:22,557
<i>and came back to St. Petersburg.</i>

408
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,837
The creditors take the animals.

409
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:27,674
<i>The elephants, kept a mile away,</i>
<i>are taken away.</i>

410
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:38,558
<i>Leni Peickert</i>
<i>files for bankruptcy.</i>

411
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:04,354
A break, since there is no money.

412
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:11,398
<i>Perez sent his report to the</i>
<i>Condor Oil Company in San Francisco.</i>

413
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:17,156
<i>"Does that dirty Indian know</i>
<i>whom he is dealing with?</i>

414
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:21,912
<i>Does that dirty Indian know</i>
<i>whom he is dealing with?"</i>

415
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:26,158
<i>Thus spoke the president, Mr Collins.</i>

416
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:30,718
<i>"There is no land in the universe</i>
<i>I want that I can't get.</i>

417
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:33,390
<i>Not in this universe. For sure.</i>

418
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:36,954
<i>If I wanted land on Jupiter,</i>

419
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:39,960
<i>I'd get it. For sure."</i>

420
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:38,309
Love? Your love for the circus
won't earn you any money.

421
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:43,629
Your love is a misconception,
it's not 'intersubjective'.

422
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:47,914
Others won't love it just because
you do. That's why I propose

423
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:53,957
a combined motivation-image survey
to find out what others love.

424
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:59,790
<i>Gitti's father led a socialist</i>
<i>scientific institute in Frankfurt.</i>

425
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:04,916
<i>He transferred its capital</i>
<i>to the USA in 1932:</i>

426
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:09,433
<i>Many opportunities for entrepreneurs,</i>
<i>none for socialists.</i>

427
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:23,715
<i>Gitti Bornemann is under medical care.</i>

428
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:26,435
<i>No chance of recovery.</i>

429
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:33,871
<i>Von Fritsch said to Ebert, "Swine!"</i>

430
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:59,554
Gitti Bornemann dies.
Leni Peickert is her sole heir.

431
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:14,433
LENI PEICKERT INC.

432
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:33,832
Ms Peickert,
I'd like to return to this...

433
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:38,796
So I dive into the net from
a height of 60 feet.

434
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:43,199
I could also show you some ballet,

435
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:47,474
and some acrobatics
and gymnastics on the floor.

436
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:51,071
I think you'll like these things

437
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:56,036
because I had
thorough training in Switzerland.

438
01:08:57,280 --> 01:09:00,989
Have you ever studied
the physics of the trapeze?

439
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:03,192
No, it's purely intuitive.

440
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:23,072
What do you want to change? The front
four? - Yes, that gap is too big.

441
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:25,351
I like it, though.

442
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:27,392
Give me a smile.

443
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:32,034
I'd prefer to leave it too, but...

444
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:36,350
You don't notice it.

445
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,637
Oh yes, you do!

446
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:43,954
Leni Peickert
informs the press about her plans.

447
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:56,593
I think I understand
what you want now.

448
01:09:57,040 --> 01:10:00,191
You want the public to participate,

449
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:04,428
not to submit passively to sensations.

450
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:06,359
Indeed...

451
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:10,715
you want them to feel

452
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:14,470
really confronted with the animals.

453
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:19,989
Quite original,
to conceive the circus as a novel.

454
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:25,275
Isn't there a risk of confusing
two quite heterogeneous genres?

455
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:28,234
I know the practical side,
the theory's the problem.

456
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:30,750
I leave that to my assistants.

457
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:37,594
As a circus it is... - Circus too!
It's inherent in the circus.

458
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:40,349
I think you should
leave the circus as it is

459
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:43,758
and just give people what they want.
- I won't...

460
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:47,988
I don't want to.
A large transparent pool...

461
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:52,030
<i>Mr Arbogast, public relations.</i>
<i>Joe Willkins, dramatist.</i>

462
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:56,951
...a few dolphins driving
smaller fish towards the clowns.

463
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:58,753
Acting...

464
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:04,832
I know, you need drama
but let's not fight over details now.

465
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:09,193
I'd like to come back
to the distrust you mentioned.

466
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:12,950
I mean,
I don't understand that.

467
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:15,994
We must get rid of that distrust

468
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:18,237
and work together.

469
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:23,071
I think it's bad
that you should think

470
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:25,750
we distrust each other.

471
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:28,316
What put that into your head?

472
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:37,355
...which you can't separate
if you think about it.

473
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:41,511
I think it could be successful

474
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:44,715
provided there is a good publicity.

475
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:47,549
It could be done...

476
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:51,595
...he keeps running away, and
they smash against the wall.

477
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:57,433
It shouldn't be boring, there
should be a progression in brutality,

478
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:01,236
different ways of dropping them,

479
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:06,470
building to a climax...
Let it fall into the sand first,

480
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:10,230
then some hard object
is pushed there with the foot...

481
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:14,753
...suddenly add a level,
chase after them,

482
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:17,668
and try to catch the small animals

483
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:21,396
and paint a Star of David on them.

484
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:25,958
That's too direct.
- If we leave the tigers with the mice

485
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,956
primitive people will indeed laugh.

486
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:36,238
Yes, there is that David and Goliath
idea which has a very strong appeal.

487
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:39,558
But David must win, and this one won't.
- Yes,

488
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:45,757
but we could make a huge
papier mâché Mickey Mouse figure

489
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:51,718
and the tamer would come out
very small, against the tigers...

490
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:05,992
How the piously the heath sings,
How the sound enters my soul!

491
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:34,357
An old winter circus is for rent.

494
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:02,879
<i>we don't know</i>
<i>if the circus will have 1 or 3 rings.</i>

495

<i>The shooting of</i>
<i>Mexico's emperor, Maximilian.</i>

496
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:39,032
The emperor was a poor privateer,
but his counsellors were tough.

497
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:42,517
The soldiers cock their rifles
but don't shoot. They say,

sweetly sings good-night

503
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:02,232
<i>Your heart has...</i>

504
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:05,638
Happy is the man
who can forget what he was.

505
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:10,955
A last kiss on your lips

506
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:14,836
<i>And the song is over.</i>

507
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:21,355
A sweet greeting
waves you all the way home.

508
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:29,318
Tonight our comrades will be shot.

509
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:42,677
<i>Thus the comrades shot Emperor Max.</i>

510
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:19,311
Von Lüptow rehearses with the clowns.

511
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:23,719
One foot down, the other one,
the other one up.

512
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:26,390
I'm waiting until I can fly.

513
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:32,710
Then I fly...
One finally flies.

514
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:38,837
You hit something,
but it doesn't hurt.

515
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:43,559
No, it's fun to crash like that.

516
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,992
Just to crash like that...

517
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:52,749
to roll around on the ground,

518
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:59,871
to fly into there...
right there into the mud.

519
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:53,879
Program plan:

520
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:55,833
1st part: The clowns.

521
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:58,589
1) The staff enter.

522
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:00,155
2) Record concert.

523
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:03,672
3) The shooting of Emperor Maximilian.

524
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:07,192
4) Encounter with alien intelligence,

525
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:09,437
represented by dolphins.

526
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:12,952
Guns being set up.
- That was the fifth act.

527
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:15,436
2nd part: The animals.

528
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:18,314
1) Rats at work.

529
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:23,920
An elephant smashes 3 barriers
and charges at the audience.

530
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:25,952
He looks violent.

531
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:30,837
In the big top hangs a model
of a Japanese dive-bomber.

532
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:36,230
Will this stop the raving pachyderm?

533
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:37,510
3rd number.

534
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:40,190
4) Pack of elephants.

535
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:42,596
Seek Greece with your soul.

536
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:46,032
Mandolin concerto by the elephants.

537
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:49,756
1) The ring is dark.

538
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:51,918
Storm, thunder, lightning.

539
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:55,716
Polar bears up high,
a plane landing.

540
01:18:56,920 --> 01:19:00,037
Seven tigers trying to stop
sixty red mice.

541
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:01,435
They fail.

542
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:05,759
The tigers form a pyramid
and give paw.

543
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:11,031
3) The polar bears in the big top
light a fire to warm themselves.

544
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:12,799
4) Some artists,

545
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:16,232
disguised as firemen, declare that...

546
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:35,359
They're all destroyed,
but none will admit it.

547
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:38,792
Clowns mourn their lost honour.

548
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:42,471
7) All performers leave the stage.

549
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:44,638
The end.

550
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:28,755
After my release as a POW,

551
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:35,830
it was established that my right eye
had been somewhat damaged.

552
01:20:36,280 --> 01:20:41,752
It happened in the East,
in a partisan battle,

553
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:47,957
when I was hit in the eye
with a rifle-butt.

554
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:55,677
Yes, so it was damaged, and now...

555
01:20:56,120 --> 01:21:01,114
I have to wear this eyeglass,
a monocle, to aid my sight.

556
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:08,156
I have to use the muscles,
it doesn't work with this one...

557
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:15,675
But I have one
with an elasticated ring.

558
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:21,078
But this one's very hard to hold in.

559
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:27,360
It should hold somehow...

560
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:29,395
And...

561
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,472
You see?

562
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:37,356
That's why a system
working with springs...

563
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:40,439
What do you do?

564
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:42,757
In what sense do you mean?

565
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:45,236
I'm a trapeze artist.

566
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:48,592
I work on the high trapeze.

567
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:53,518
Perry Woodcock, a horse owner,
asks for advice.

568
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:03,268
It started out quite well.

569
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:07,679
She attracted me,
and we were sitting at the bar,

570
01:22:08,120 --> 01:22:11,396
and then she said,
and then I said...

571
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:14,115
I was rather direct, so I said,

572
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:17,438
"Why don't you take off your bra..."

573
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:22,237
So she did it, and gave it to me.
It was great fun.

574
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:25,911
We left together after closing time,

575
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:29,113
she asked me to,
and I didn't mind.

576
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:33,758
I wasn't that interested in her,
anyway. Only a bit.

577
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:39,638
She said I looked like
Roy Black, or something.

578
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:42,992
And then she lay on the bed
and masturbated.

579
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:47,592
I prefer a woman like that,
she knows what she wants.

580
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:50,395
Seen from the psychological side,

581
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:53,559
I could condemn her
or behave improperly,

582
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:59,279
but I think I gave her
much more like that...

583
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:02,917
I don't mind being Roy Black for her.

584
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:05,796
At this time there was a congress

585
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:08,959
of circus directors in Nuremberg.

586
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:13,559
WELCOME TO THE GUNPOWDER FACTORY

587
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:26,112
Leni Peickert and von Lüptow
assess the congress papers.

588
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:29,950
"I'd like to see the man
who, after Auschwitz,

589
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:33,551
tries to stop us saying something
that has to be said."

590
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,195
I'd like to see the man
who, after Auschwitz,

591
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:39,108
tries to stop us saying or doing
what we believe to be correct."

592
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:42,199
Moscow State Circus, Mr Reisch:

593
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:45,552
"After two wars, I don't want
to show off animals any more."

594
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:49,879
Perizoff laughs. Petoletti:
"We know what we don't want."

595
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:52,276
Mr Reisch, Moscow State Circus:

596
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:57,077
"The modern circus should be
scientific." - Where?

597
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:02,230
Burkhardt-Footit, USA,
"...and yet respect ethical limits."

598
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:04,875
Blumenfeldt for all present:

599
01:25:05,320 --> 01:25:09,074
"I'd like to see the man
who, after Auschwitz,

600
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:14,958
tries to stop us saying or doing
what we believe to be correct."

601
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:19,310
Unanimous: "We'll keep the rats."

602
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:23,435
Drinks are being served.
- Applause. A pause.

603
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:27,952
Mr Michael Saluti: "Disgusting!"

604
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:30,959
The end.

605
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:36,950
"Cannot be shown."
Korti: "Cannot be shown."

606
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:43,351
Ferry Corvey shows a film
about a prime minister

607
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:46,792
who for a moment
believes in the impossible.

608
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:49,316
"That has to be said."

609
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:53,751
Blumenfeldt, for all present:
"No one can stop us

610
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:56,111
showing what we want to...

611
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:59,028
I'd like to see the one
who, after Auschwitz..."

612
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:07,672
<i>Mr Arbogast speaks</i>
<i>on entertainment again.</i>

613
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:11,510
<i>Leni Peickert decides,</i>
<i>"Mr Arbogast is right.</i>

614
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:13,439
<i>Freedom means that</i>
<i>the spectator thinks</i>

615
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:16,428
<i>entertainment is that</i>
<i>what we offer him.</i>

616
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:19,553
<i>But it needn't</i>
<i>actually be entertainment."</i>

617
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:24,391
<i>The staff are desperate.</i>
<i>They think this is nonsense.</i>

618
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:52,428
To put it more concretely:

619
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:58,468
You're like a child
blowing soap bubbles,

620
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:02,754
blowing, or producing,
more and more bubbles,

621
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:05,509
never stopping, because you hope

622
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:08,952
you'll blow one bubble
more colourful than the last.

623
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:12,949
You thereby forget
that you're blowing bubbles.

624
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:17,474
So that one bubble will remain?

625
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:19,717
That's the problem.

626
01:27:20,160 --> 01:27:22,958
That's why it begins at all,

627
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:27,029
the blowing, the senseless part of it.

628
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:34,512
Because one wants a bubble
that really exists?

629
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:37,952
A bubble that 'should' exist, I'd say,

630
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:42,154
because they don't
actually exist at all.

631
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:46,513
It should be one
that could retain its form

632
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:50,919
for more than a few seconds.

633
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:55,273
To put it in a more abstract way:

634
01:27:55,720 --> 01:27:59,998
You don't want utopia
just flying round in your mind,

635
01:28:00,440 --> 01:28:04,797
you want to see utopia
realized in a concrete way.

636
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:08,233
Utopia grows ever better
the longer we wait.

637
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:12,832
<i>Leni Peickert looked at it thus:</i>
<i>"One should be true to oneself."</i>

638
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:14,952
<i>She asks von Lüptow,</i>

639
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:19,552
<i>"How much will we have</i>
<i>if we sell out right now?"</i>

640
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:25,438
<i>He answers, "About 200,000 DM."</i>
<i>Enough for a new start.</i>

641
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:36,279
<i>They bring the elephants</i>
<i>across the border.</i>

642
01:29:20,840 --> 01:29:25,868
<i>They are arrested, the elephants</i>
<i>are seized. They launch a lawsuit.</i>

643
01:29:27,720 --> 01:29:29,676
<i>Tax investigations.</i>

644
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:37,075
Leni Peickert:

645
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:40,159
"Great reformers are great obstacles."

646
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:43,034
<i>She read it in "Die Welt".</i>

647
01:29:43,480 --> 01:29:46,870
<i>A lawyer reforming Thuringian jails</i>

648
01:29:47,320 --> 01:29:51,871
<i>in the 1920s took a leading position</i>
<i>in the Hesse judiciary after 1945.</i>

649
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:56,632
<i>He used it to impede</i>
<i>any attempt at reform except his own.</i>

650
01:31:12,520 --> 01:31:17,355
WHERE YOU CANNOT LOVE, PASS BY.
ELEONORA DUSE

651
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:34,829
<i>She reads that countless mines</i>
<i>and oil wells are lying unused</i>

652
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:38,192
<i>in the wilds of Nigeria, in Biafra.</i>

653
01:31:38,640 --> 01:31:42,952
<i>One could do business</i>
<i>with just a few weapons and a plane.</i>

654
01:31:57,520 --> 01:32:01,957
<i>On her return, Leni Peickert</i>
<i>takes up her studies again.</i>

655
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:14,394
So the receiver can change

656
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:18,515
the signals
into luminous dots on a tube,

657
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:23,556
reconstituting the picture...

658
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:29,074
The technical process can
be defined like this:

659
01:32:30,120 --> 01:32:31,155
We see...

660
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:34,118
THEORY OF MASS MEDIA

661
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:36,312
...the act of perception
as it is produced.

662
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:40,275
Place a man in front of a camera,
film him,

663
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:44,998
he's scanned electronically,
dissolved into dots.

664
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:48,989
The dots are transmitted
and reach a receiver,

665
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:52,352
reach my eyes,
but what do they evoke?

666
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:54,756
That's the question!

667
01:32:55,760 --> 01:32:59,639
"Giving a sense of life happening.

668
01:33:00,640 --> 01:33:05,430
The acoustic perception in recording
is like sound-film technology

669
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:08,269
and transmission in radio."

670
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:12,349
<i>Leni Peickert intends</i>
<i>to take a job in television.</i>

671
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:25,352
I studied Italian and English,
but little German, I'm afraid.

672
01:33:34,280 --> 01:33:37,636
...can't be granted.
Lost 4 seconds again.

673
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:41,993
The enchanting woman smiles, like now.

674
01:33:42,440 --> 01:33:46,069
The enchanted man wants
to meet the enchanting woman.

675
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:50,069
If you could pass on the enchantment
it would save time.

676
01:34:27,320 --> 01:34:29,390
Bi-phase. Regulator channel open.

677
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:35,233
...two reports
with similar contents: A1 = A2.

678
01:34:35,680 --> 01:34:38,752
<i>All her former staff</i>
<i>now work for television.</i>

679
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:43,555
<i>At night, they work on serials.</i>

680
01:34:46,040 --> 01:34:47,314
Dot, paragraph, new line.

681
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:49,034
Saturn underlined.

682
01:34:49,480 --> 01:34:55,669
120,800 km in diameter,
1.4 times the earth's gravity,

683
01:34:56,120 --> 01:35:04,789
0.7 g/cc mean density, 37 km/s...

684
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:10,189
Professor Gerloff wants to use
television to spread his ideas

685
01:35:10,640 --> 01:35:14,349
of education, in particular
the global promotion of Latin.

686
01:35:16,520 --> 01:35:19,512
Let me explain...

687
01:35:19,960 --> 01:35:21,951
Have you ever been
to the Sistine Chapel? - No.

688
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:25,073
No? You've never been there?

689
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:30,036
I mean, it is something
one really must see.

690
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:39,549
<i>This will grow together, sometime...</i>
<i>Love for work, novels and television.</i>

691
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:45,752
Korti allows his soul to wander
among beautiful things.

692
01:35:49,120 --> 01:35:51,918
<i>He sometimes</i>
<i>has little visual adventures.</i>

693
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:04,559
<i>He is an official</i>
<i>in the D.A.'s office, vice department.</i>

694
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:08,396
Scientific and artistic writings
which deal with sexual issues

695
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:11,832
ennoble them, raising them
beyond their sexual appeal,

696
01:36:12,280 --> 01:36:15,955
so that one's sense of propriety
is not offended...

697
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:22,592
<i>Korti is eating pig's ear</i>
<i>on a bed of vegetables.</i>

698
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:23,995
Looks rather good.

699
01:36:24,440 --> 01:36:27,398
<i>The vegetables came from Malta by air.</i>

700
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:33,954
<i>The pig's ear lies on the plate</i>
<i>like a broad, firm cloth.</i>

701
01:36:40,360 --> 01:36:45,593
<i>In her attempts to change the world,</i>
<i>Leni Peickert will meet Korti.</i>

702
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:08,671
<i>He will smother her desire for change</i>

703
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:12,789
<i>unless he himself is redeemed.</i>

704
01:37:13,240 --> 01:37:17,631
<i>Then the revolution will have in him</i>
<i>the upholder of its rights.</i>

705
01:37:52,280 --> 01:37:56,910
<i>After 18 months, Leni Peickert</i>
<i>rose to salary bracket IVa.</i>

706
01:37:58,160 --> 01:38:00,355
Great steps make one ridiculous,

707
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:05,957
but with small steps
I could make it to State Secretary.

708
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:15,350
Where do I talk into?

709
01:38:17,480 --> 01:38:20,074
Where? Right here?

710
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:24,752
So, the Troubadour.

711
01:38:25,200 --> 01:38:27,350
A rather complicated story.

712
01:38:27,800 --> 01:38:29,950
It starts with a prologue.

713
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:33,915
It takes us to the inner courtyard

714
01:38:34,360 --> 01:38:36,510
of a castle.

715
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:39,235
The prologue tells of a...

716
01:38:39,680 --> 01:38:42,478
if I only knew, I'd be happy...

717
01:38:43,640 --> 01:38:48,077
about Manrico and Count Luna,
2 brothers, unaware of each other,

718
01:38:48,520 --> 01:38:50,875
who love the same girl, Leonore.

719
01:38:51,320 --> 01:38:53,675
And Azucena, a Gypsy,

720
01:38:54,120 --> 01:38:57,556
is their mother.
No one knows about the two boys.

721
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:04,075
We only find out at the end that
they're related, when everybody dies.

722
01:39:04,520 --> 01:39:07,717
It is terribly complicated,

723
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:11,072
but I think
it's one of Verdi's best works.
