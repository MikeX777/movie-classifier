1
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,241
Your Majesty!

2
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,241
A mild seizure.
It will pass.

3
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,283
We better return to thy castle sire.

4
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,040
No, Lord Alban.
I'll not spoil the day's sport.

5
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,881
I'll return alone.

6
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,725
-But sire...
-Continue the hunt Lord Alban.

7
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,288
His Majesty's seizures
come more often.

8
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,009
-Is it wise to encourage his hunting?
-It was his own wish.

9
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,440
Should he die,
Prince Hal would rule.

10
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,765
Prince Hal would rule
his wine bottles and his tailors.

11
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,169
The Council would still rule England.

12
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,886
And the Earl of Alban
rules the Council.

13
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,767
Myles, Diccon, be quick now.
The Earl of Alban is riding this way.

14
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,320
Hurry lad, into the hayloft.

15
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,088
Unless you've decided
you'd like to become a soldier.

16
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,290
I wouldn't mind soldiering
for England,

17
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,446
but not for the Earl of Alban.

18
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,527
His Lordship commands you to fetch
water for himself and his guests.

19
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,804
At once your Lordship.
Cool water from the well.

20
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,683
After a morning's hunt a flagon
of wine would sit better than water.

21
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,486
You'd not stomach the witch's brew
my peasants call wine.

22
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,962
I won't say the same
for their wenches.

23
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,609
Seems Sir Robert doesn't intend
to come up empty handed after all.

24
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,760
Run Meg. Run!

25
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,849
So her favors are saved for you.
Peasant clod!

26
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,889
She's my sister.

27
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,362
You insolent young swine.

28
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,361
Break it down!

29
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,122
Thanks to Sir Robert
there's added zest to the day.

30
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,329
A cask of my best Spanish wine to
the man who hunts down the peasant.

31
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,681
Meg!

32
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,481
Meg!

33
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,167
-Diccon. They'll kill him.
-They'll not catch him.

34
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,209
He'll lost them in the forest
and go to Friar Edward.

35
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,883
Get your belongings and Myles.
We best be away before they return.

36
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,681
Good evening.

37
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,246
We found this horse nearby.
We seek the rider.

38
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,209
A peasant boy, dark haired.

39
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,371
At mass today I saw fully
20 peasant boys with dark hair.

40
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,922
-Are any about now?
-Mass has been over for many hours.

41
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,688
But should you wish
to come in and pray

42
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,001
the chapel is open.

43
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,846
We have no time. Sooner or later
he'll return to the cottage.

44
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,485
We'll be waiting.

45
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,841
Let them wait.

46
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,361
We'll make our way north.
We'll find other land to farm.

47
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,682
Your father never intended you
to be a farmer Myles.

48
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,370
Nor Meg a farmer's wife.

49
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,165
What we'd planned for a year hence
we must do now.

50
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,520
In the morning Diccon will take you
to the Earl of Nlackwonh.

51
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,082
This letter was entrusted to me
by your father.

52
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,282
It will remind Nlackworth
of an old friendship,

53
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,281
and ask him to take
you both into his service.

54
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,285
Now you know why you were taught
the reading, writing and Latin.

55
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,329
You go to the household
of a great noble.

56
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,410
If the scum who rode with Alban
is a sample of your nobility,

57
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,040
I'd rather stay away from them.

58
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,448
You will find a different breed
in Nlackworth Castle.

59
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,208
-Was this also left by my father?
-The ring is to remain with me.

60
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,331
Was this my father's?

61
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:32,723
That ring has been hidden for
many years and it best remain hidden.

62
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,890
You always told us that you
served in the wars with my father.

63
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,051
This coat of arms belonged
to no common soldier.

64
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,005
Diccon, please tell us now.
Who was our father?

65
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,403
Diccon was sworn never to tell you,
as was I.

66
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,766
It will avail you nothing
to question us further.

67
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,406
Leave the ring.

68
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,251
Since it was my father's
it is now mine to keep.

69
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,931
If you're seen with that ring
it could mean your death.

70
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,291
I promise to hide it well
until I learn its meaning.

71
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,570
Meg is weary and
we've got a long ride tomorrow.

72
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,926
You said it was a great castle,
but oh I had no idea.

73
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:41,366
-It's bigger than our Crispy-Dale.
-It will afford you better shelter.

74
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,289
Help me. Stop him please.

75
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,571
-Let me up.
-Stay as you are.

76
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,528
-Walter.
-Let me up you oaf.

77
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,081
My Lady.

78
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,523
Forgive me. It seems so strange.

79
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,282
I'll lash that peasant skin
to ribbons.

80
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,410
Walter no! I asked him for help.
He thought he was saving me.

81
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,721
And he did.

82
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,848
You didn't overtake me
and you'll pay the wager.

83
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,089
You've won my gratitude,
Sir Gallant.

84
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,925
And my favor.

85
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,601
Have you not had
your fill of buffoonery?

86
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:05,128
Be thankful the Lady Anne
finds you amusing, bumpkin.

87
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,166
My chivalrous friend, that is not
the way to treat a lady's favor.

88
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,286
It is to be given directly
into his Lordship's hands.

89
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,085
What a marvelous,
pretty dress she wore.

90
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,126
We bear a letter for
the Earl of Nlackwonh.

91
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,161
Give it here.

92
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,687
It is to be given directly
into his Lordship's hands.

93
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,046
I'll take the dagger country boy.
You'll get it back when you leave.

94
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,643
Take them to the Household Guard.

95
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,651
Fresh from the farm.

96
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,285
It must be a very good farm
to raise anything lovely as that.

97
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,403
Those giggling fools
are laughing at us.

98
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,490
I'll knock their silly
heads together.

99
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,561
Stop Giles!

100
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,682
Perhaps you'll tell me the jest?

101
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,211
Sure tanglefoot.

102
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,006
You've but to see yourself
and laugh with the rest of us.

103
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,566
Stop Giles!

104
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,371
And who are you rescuing now,
Sir Gallant?

105
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,369
His manners need mending.

106
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,924
-As do others here.
-This ruffian needs a flogging.

107
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,571
-I'll do it myself.
-Walter.

108
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,920
Walter no!

109
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,201
Stop.

110
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,600
Let me remind you

111
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,047
his Lordship has visitors
and also a very bad temper.

112
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,283
He'll not like
brawling in the castle.

113
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,409
I'll not incur his displeasure
over the likes of this one.

114
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:48,328
I'll ask your pardon for all
and your mercy,

115
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,926
lest your head breaking
leave our castle undefended.

116
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,284
Take along deep breath hot head.

117
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,561
Now another.

118
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,481
That's better.

119
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,849
They have come to enter into
service in this household.

120
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,925
If I can be on greater service,
just call on Francis Gascoyne.

121
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,165
I am Diccon Bowman of Crispy-Dale.
This is Myles and his sister Meg.

122
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,567
They have come to enter into
service in this household.

123
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,011
Then you're off to a bad start.

124
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,051
The vile tempered individual
who just left is Walter Blunt.

125
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,606
Chief of Esquires.

126
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,608
Since we share an opinion
of that swaggering fop

127
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,644
We bring a letter
to his Lordship from...

128
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,841
of the family.

129
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,485
Stone me Nlackwonh.
The goblet's empty again.

130
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,921
Right in the soup.
I've done it properly.

131
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,931
-Let's go back.
-Your Highness,

132
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,048
From an old friend.

133
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,281
Oh good. Good!

134
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,284
The Prince of Wales is visiting.

135
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,444
You might as well get comfortable.

136
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,321
It sometimes takes a long while to
drag Prince Hall away from his wine.

137
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,609
In that case we'll join you,
after a glass or two.

138
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,490
-Let's go back.
-Your Highness,

139
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,606
I have some excellent wine
in the library.

140
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,524
Oh good. Good!

141
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,284
Would your grace care to join us?

142
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,566
I have neither your capacity
nor appetite for wine your Highness.

143
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,609
In that case we'll join you,
after a glass or two.

144
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,370
They have gone your Highness.

145
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,444
Drunkard. Wastrel.

146
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,524
Fog. How I tire of
this sour game we play.

147
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,888
The fate of England
is worthy of a game.

148
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,329
Even to your daughter
becoming a pawn?

149
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,811
When last I saw Alban

150
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,440
he spoke to me of an alliance
between his house and yours.

151
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,723
I've long known of his desires

152
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,846
from the day Walter Blunt,
his brother, came to me.

153
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,967
Alban trusts me
to encourage this alliance.

154
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,162
So successfully
have I played his fool.

155
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,050
-What's our move now?
-I must keep my pretence

156
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,084
as you must keep yours.

157
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,690
Should once your mask slip,

158
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:34,601
Alban would recognize England's
future king as strong and just.

159
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,641
In that recognition lies your death.

160
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,963
Would that there were a sword
to rid us of this pestilence.

161
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,683
Neither yours nor mine
is skilled enough.

162
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,006
So I must play AI ban’s friend

163
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,321
and you his fool.

164
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,085
Your Highness, we should go.

165
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,480
I have asked Master Gascoyne
to point out his Lordship to you.

166
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,291
Should the letter reach other hands
it would be a serious matter.

167
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,449
Now Myles. The older one.

168
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,845
What in the name of...?

169
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,609
Who are you?
What do you want?

170
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,002
We are Meg and Myles
of Crispy-Dale.

171
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,246
What?

172
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,409
I know of no such name.

173
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,688
Speak up boy.
What do you want?

174
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,887
We have a letter here
for your Lordship.

175
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,564
Stand up. Get on your feet.

176
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,324
No need to keep kneeling forever.

177
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,650
exchanged near
the Tower of Caesar

178
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,171
I feel such a bore,
knowing how to read.

179
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,324
"By the pledges we ex...

180
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,888
exchanged near
the Tower of Caesar

181
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,084
-the day we won our spurs..."
-Your Highness

182
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,245
it is of no importance.

183
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,050
Sir Charles.

184
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,966
Your Highness.

185
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,922
What a fine cut of damask.
You must send your tailor to me.

186
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,923
I should be delighted to do so.

187
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:37,287
Someone I knew 20 years ago seeks
to saddle me with his children.

188
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,522
I should have to take them
for the sake of peace and quiet.

189
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,408
Gascoyne, turn the lass
over to Dame Ellen

190
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,045
and conduct the lad
to Sir James.

191
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,961
Let him be entered
as a Squire At Arms.

192
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,047
He's too rough a cub
for a page.

193
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,723
It's much shorter
if we go through here.

194
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,968
It's his Lordship's library.

195
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,883
-You know what a library is?
-A place with books.

196
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,362
-You've seen books?
-I can read and write.

197
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,326
Can you?

198
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,485
Have you ever seen so many books?

199
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,730
His Lordship has 24.
My name's mentioned in that one.

200
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,370
That is a distant relative's name.

201
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,722
He must have been important
to have a book about him.

202
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,370
He's on one page.

203
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,926
This is the book of Heraldry.

204
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,122
It's an index of all
the noble families of England.

205
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,567
Coats of Arms, histories,
you know.

206
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,001
Myles.

207
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,166
Never let him catch you
walking through the library.

208
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,201
It's forbidden.
The penalty is extra drill.

209
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:58,161
Or much worse, a fine
word or two from Sir James.

210
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,050
-Get out!
-Yes sir.

211
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,686
-You blundering idiot.
-I understand Sir James.

212
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,087
-Very well then, get out!
-At once.

213
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,008
The old bear's wounds
must really be aching.

214
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,329
He sunk his teeth in
my flesh and chewed.

215
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,081
Come in.

216
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,324
-Sir.
-Yes?

217
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,882
This is Myles of Crispy-Dale.

218
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,566
My Lord bids you enter him upon
the roll as Squire At Arms.

219
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,770
So, I'm bid
to take another of you.

220
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,202
And this one an oaf by his carriage.

221
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:00,164
I'll change my rules for no one.
Not for him, not for a better man.

222
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,883
I'll train no man
as Squire At Arms

223
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,531
until I test whether he be fit
to hold such place.

224
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,323
I'll enter his name as unclassified.

225
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,244
-Find him a bed. Procure him a livery.
-Yes sir.

226
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,850
What terrible...

227
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,206
Scullery manners.

228
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,646
Now you listen to me.

229
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,406
I wear it. They wear it.
And you'll wear it too.

230
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,525
-No. It makes me look like a fish.
-I'll teach you.

231
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,481
Dame Ellen.

232
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,647
What is the meaning of this...
this ridiculous tableau?

233
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,286
She refuses to wear
the proper dress My Lady.

234
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,521
Refuses?

235
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,565
Such impudence.

236
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,160
She says I look like
a shapeless sack.

237
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,643
Oh not you Dame Ellen.

238
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,447
And she said Dame Sybil
was an old hag.

239
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,651
Such impudence.

240
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,162
I'll take care of this,
Dame Ellen.

241
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,811
Come here girl.

242
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,521
Quickly.

243
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,486
It is really not polite
to call them hags.

244
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,964
Even if they might be.

245
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,007
My father surrounds me
with those relics.

246
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,369
Now will you put
that silly jug away?

247
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,330
I'll not wear that dress.

248
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,689
You're as full of pepper
as your brother.

249
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,009
Oh I am pleased.
mayhap it'll be less dull here.

250
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,806
You come with me.

251
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,769
This one has possibilities.

252
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,526
Here's your home for
the next several years.

253
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,010
Those steps lead down
the corridor to the courtyard.

254
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,001
Thomas!

255
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,766
You're losing again.

256
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,371
Here's our water.

257
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,488
We all take turns filling this.

258
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,609
These leads to the exercise field.

259
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,841
Myles.

260
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:46,208
You don't want to go in there,
not of your own free will.

261
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,879
I'll show you how to do that.

262
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,281
Those Sir James
is training for knighthood.

263
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,485
This will be yours.
I'm over here.

264
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,719
These have to be kept
clean and polished.

265
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,484
I'll show you how to do that.

266
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,969
What is the stench
that fills this place?

267
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:07,409
Good lads!
How can you bear it?

268
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,848
It doesn't even
help to hold your nose.

269
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,406
Can it be a dead swine
or decaying goat.

270
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,410
It can be but one thing,

271
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,731
a peasant.

272
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,764
My head is reeling. Why even this
seems to be losing its strength.

273
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,126
What shall I do?

274
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,686
-My Lord?
-Yes?

275
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,565
Hold it a little closer.

276
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,201
Stop that!

277
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,650
They'll be no brawling.

278
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,489
Unless I take part in it.

279
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,445
Back to your places.

280
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,962
Sir James has informed me you're
being entered on the roll farm boy.

281
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,368
-Well you've begun badly.
-Myles did not start it.

282
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,487
Get to bed.

283
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,411
I was also informed that
you're from Crispy-Dale.

284
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,091
Any more trouble and
you'll wish you were back there.

285
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:02,162
My brother might find it strange
that Nlackworth

286
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,369
plucks a peasant off his farms
and trains him for a squire.

287
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,806
The Earl of Alban...
your brother?

288
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,206
Yes. Why?

289
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,161
Nothing.

290
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,125
Cover fire.

291
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,484
The right flank.

292
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,931
The left flank.

293
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,921
Head.

294
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,160
Parry.

295
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,167
Left flank.

296
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,166
Right flank.

297
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,041
Right flank.

298
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,481
Left flank.

299
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,807
How long does this go on?

300
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,521
Tired? So soon?

301
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,005
This blade is no feather.

302
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,530
Left flank.

303
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,690
Head.

304
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,446
Right flank.

305
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,051
Left flank.

306
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,091
Right flank.

307
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,647
Right cheek.

308
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,322
-Left flank.
-I think my arm will fall off.

309
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,686
If it does, you'll be
allowed to use the other one.

310
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,771
Left flank.

311
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,530
Right flank.
Head.

312
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,084
Left flank.
Right flank.

313
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,046
Right cheek!

314
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,529
I can see you know little
of the subtle art of conquest.

315
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,446
A lady never lets a man know
she's interested.

316
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,121
Pretend indifference.
Hardly notice him.

317
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,770
Left flank.
Left flank.

318
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,645
Right flank.

319
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,089
Left flank.
Right cheek.

320
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,606
Right flank.

321
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,161
Head.

322
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,442
Left flank.
Right flank.

323
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,130
Right cheek.

324
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,770
You may watch them
but they may not watch you.

325
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,041
Head.

326
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,965
Left flank.

327
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,684
-Rig ht flank!
-Get your shield up Myles.

328
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,560
Higher.

329
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,768
-Good morning lovely Lady.
-And to you Sir James.

330
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,609
We were just coming for you
for permission to watch.

331
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,522
You may watch them
but they may not watch you.

332
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,968
The first lad who casts
his eye in this direction,

333
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,290
I'll have it plucked out
and fed to the buzzards.

334
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,245
-Head.
-Sheathe your swords.

335
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,444
When Sir James gets that look
it means trouble.

336
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,407
Rest.
Not you.

337
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,040
Now then.
Strike a blow at me.

338
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,890
Come on strike.
Take your sword out.

339
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,524
What's the matter?
Are you afraid?

340
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,529
That's for your impudence,

341
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,484
and to teach you the reason
for holding your shield high.

342
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,119
Yes Sir James,

343
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,886
perhaps Sir, you would act my part
that I may learn better.

344
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,291
What? Right.

345
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,520
Have at me now.

346
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,331
Sometimes Sir,

347
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,528
it is well to keep the shield low.

348
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,530
It is also well
never to underestimate the enemy.

349
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,601
Blunt,

350
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,924
continue the exercises.

351
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,569
To your places.

352
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,126
Thank you, Sir James.

353
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,124
Giles, call the commands.

354
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,370
Draw swords.

355
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,921
On guard.

356
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,448
Right cheek.
Left cheek.

357
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,241
Right flank.
Left flank.

358
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,680
Head.

359
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,645
Right cheek.
Left cheek.

360
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,244
Right cheek.
Rest.

361
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,165
Put down your shield.

362
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,484
Now hold out your arm.

363
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,762
I'll teach you to obey orders.

364
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,687
-Do you find it heavy?
-No.

365
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,561
You will.

366
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:56,846
Now stand here and keep
your arm straight and level.

367
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,811
On guard.

368
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,843
Right cheek.
Left cheek.

369
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,044
Right flank.
Left flank. Head.

370
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,561
Better?

371
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,446
Try to raise it.

372
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,362
Blunt must have a stone
for a heart.

373
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,607
I'd like to pluck it out and see.

374
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,965
We're supposed to be in bed.

375
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,642
You go. I'll be in after a while.
Please go.

376
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,170
-Who is it?
-Myles.

377
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,129
What are you doing here?
What's wrong?

378
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,885
There's no other way I can reach
the library without being seen.

379
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,851
-I've a mind to look at a book.
-Have you lost your wits?

380
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,166
The Book of Heraldry.

381
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,767
I may learn something about
the coat of arms on the ring.

382
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,809
Myles, we promised Diccon.

383
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,002
Promised him not to ask,
and we won't.

384
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:43,403
Meg, why do you think I stay here?
Our secret is here.

385
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,210
Our father and our birth.

386
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,969
Once I find it,

387
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,004
to the devil with Nlackworth Castle.

388
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,569
I'll see if the way is clear.

389
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,886
Meg, watch here.

390
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,769
Lady Anne and Walter Blunt.

391
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,082
Is not my choice
to be considered, Walter?

392
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,771
Well choose then

393
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,321
and let it be with
a love to match my own.

394
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,960
My brother grows impatient Anne.

395
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,883
He desires the alliance
of our houses

396
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,485
as I desire you.

397
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,371
Do we speak of desire then,
or alliances?

398
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,769
One word from my brother and
King Henry will command our marriage.

399
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,688
I care not for a reluctant wife,

400
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,602
rather that you would
want me willingly.

401
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,449
Then be patient Walter.

402
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,529
I'm done with patience Anne.

403
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,728
I'll have a talk with
your father this night.

404
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:29,409
I can swear to Sir Hubert's loyalty,
but as for the Earl of Devon...

405
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:37,921
Nlackwonh, you're a sly one
keeping your best wines hidden here.

406
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,481
-Oh Lady Anne.
-Your Highness.

407
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,645
My apologies your Highness,
we thought his Lordship was alone.

408
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:48,526
There were matters I wish to discuss,
but it can wait until tomorrow.

409
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,445
With your permission your Highness.

410
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,521
My Lord.

411
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,885
From BIunt's expression the matter
must have been of importance.

412
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,969
He was going to ask
my hand in marriage.

413
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,808
Lady Anne seems none too happy
at the prospect.

414
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,483
I was just reminded that a word
from Alban to his Majesty

415
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,961
and it would be ordered.

416
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,243
Anne is not a child
your Highness.

417
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,480
She is aware of her obligations
and not offend the King.

418
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,130
Nor dare we offend Alban.

419
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,364
It's far wiser to please him.

420
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,967
I shall suggest
a great wedding at court.

421
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,886
Of course we should have
to wait until Blunt is knighted.

422
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,368
But it will be worth the delay.

423
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:40,085
What a wonderful excuse to gather
wine from all over the world.

424
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,370
By your leave your Highness,

425
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,926
I merely wish
to bid my father good night.

426
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,041
My dear...

427
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,562
Anne I pray you understand...

428
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,007
What manner of mischief
brings you to my library?

429
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,848
Knew you not
it was forbidden to you?

430
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,282
I knew my Lord
but my sister did not.

431
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,450
Henceforth keep this girl
in your quarters where she belongs.

432
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,808
-How came you by this?
-It was with the letter I brought.

433
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,770
Then it should
have been given to me.

434
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,684
-It is mine.
-You insolent young...

435
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:43,122
Back to your quarters before
I turn you over to my guards.

436
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,970
I thank you
for your silence my Lady.

437
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:55,124
If you're to stay out of trouble
I think we best leave this castle.

438
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,281
No.

439
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,681
There are riddles about us
that can only be answered here.

440
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,849
In the glorious reign of
our sovereign Lord King Henry,

441
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,921
My Lady.

442
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,846
I thought the coat of arms
in this ring looked familiar.

443
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,041
Falworth.

444
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,760
In the glorious reign of
our sovereign Lord King Henry,

445
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,089
Falworth was not traitor.
By the cross I swear it.

446
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,251
its estates confiscated,

447
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,044
its coat of arms
struck from heraldry

448
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:36,210
and its every member
ordered put to death.

449
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,883
Falworth was not traitor.
By the cross I swear it.

450
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,120
The lives of his two children
are in your hands.

451
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,325
I have not seen this.

452
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,241
If Blunt thinks I'll fetch water
for him for a month he's daffy.

453
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,044
Could have been worse
after what you did.

454
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,446
I served that punishment.

455
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,967
Sir James worked me 10 days
on the exercise field.

456
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,042
This is BIunt's idea,
not his Lordship's.

457
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:24,529
I'm supposed to carry all the water.

458
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,203
Here. I'll lend a hand
and get you started.

459
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,526
That'll get you into trouble.

460
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,887
I'm supposed to carry all the water.

461
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,204
I need the exercise.

462
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,609
Hurry up. I have no wish
to wait the day for my wash.

463
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,929
By heavens,
the sluggard wastes our time.

464
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,405
Empty it dimwit.

465
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,249
You're gonna take a beating.

466
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,321
-Shall we help him?
-He doesn't much need it.

467
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,561
Get him.

468
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,601
Get out of the way.

469
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,605
Hold him.
I'll finish him.

470
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,290
I'll take no part in killing him.

471
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,930
Put it down.

472
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,927
What have you to say for yourself,
Blunt?

473
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,600
This filth has caused trouble
ever since he came here.

474
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,363
His Lordship ordered me
to discipline him.

475
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,325
Brawling and discipline
are not the same thing.

476
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,488
It's the only discipline
this peasant understands.

477
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,407
Calm yourselves.

478
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,930
Now forget your differences
and shake hands.

479
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,084
Did you hear me Walter Blunt?

480
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,851
Is this the chivalry expected of
one soon to be knighted by the king?

481
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,885
Nobody's knighting me.
I don't have to be chivalrous.

482
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,890
Go about your business Blunt.

483
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,361
And the rest of you.

484
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,565
I don't like your manners.
Change them.

485
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,202
Nor your truculence.
Drop it.

486
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,927
Nor your impudence.
Mask it.

487
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,003
As for your temper, curb it.

488
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:57,523
If I learn of your brawling
just once more,

489
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:01,361
I'll fling you from the walls
of Castle Nlackworth myself.

490
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,771
Lunge. Back.

491
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:17,001
Lunge. Back.

492
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:21,047
Lunge. Back.

493
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,407
Lunge. Back.

494
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,008
If you care at all
for Francis Gascoyne

495
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,123
avail upon your brother
to curb his violence.

496
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,323
Since that night in the library
I've only seen him from a distance.

497
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,728
Between Dame Ellen and Sir James.

498
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,569
I'm sure he worries about you.

499
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,206
At least write him a note
and let him know your well.

500
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,449
-Nlay I?
-Of course.

501
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,805
And should you mention that we're
in the garden each day at four,

502
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:42,765
it wouldn't surprise me if Myles
finds some way to see you.

503
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,448
Possibly Francis too.

504
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,930
Here it is.

505
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,722
I didn't dream
I could hit it that far.

506
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:23,921
It was behind the hedge.

507
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:27,203
-Dame Ellen, your stroke.
-Oh no Lady.

508
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,681
Yes. Don't you remember?
You follow Meg and then...

509
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,481
What was that?

510
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,690
Probably some clumsy guard
in the castle.

511
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,490
-It sounded as if...
-You're right. It is my stroke.

512
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,646
Thank you Meg.

513
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,685
Oh dear!

514
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,171
Let me help Dame Ellen.

515
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,604
-Dame Ellen!
-Oh my!

516
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,650
Let me help.

517
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,445
Will you ever forgive me?

518
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,090
I sought merely to help.

519
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,362
Oh how careless of me.
Now I've ruined the game.

520
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,484
You must change quickly,
before you take a chill.

521
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:25,089
Don't fret Dame Ellen,
and do hurry back.

522
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:30,203
And I think you two had better
start another game.

523
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,045
I believe we will.

524
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:21,526
-It's not chivalrous to spy on them.
-Not very.

525
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:26,122
-Not what a gentleman does.
-Far from it.

526
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,247
We ought to leave.

527
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:32,847
Shall we?

528
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:58,369
How can you be so rash?
You know this place is forbidden.

529
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,890
-What is it Myles?
-My ankle.

530
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,201
The bench.

531
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:16,926
That's better.

532
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,488
If I could just rest here a moment.

533
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:24,045
But four of us, we'll be seen.
Two would be hidden from the windows.

534
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,284
Francis, you and Meg,

535
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,763
could hide in the other arbor.

536
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,125
Is it the same ankle you sprained
falling from the windmill?

537
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,890
No, that was my other...

538
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:55,807
How did you know?

539
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:58,805
Meg told me many things
about her adventurous brother.

540
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,640
I never heard of anyone trying
to ride the blade of a windmill.

541
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,888
It seemed like an excellent idea
at the time.

542
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:09,764
-I can't be seated in your presence.
-No, please.

543
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,204
We'll both Sit.

544
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,524
Until you feel better.

545
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:38,965
What else did Meg tell you?

546
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:42,571
She said that your father
and my father were old friends.

547
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:43,886
So we were told.

548
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,048
But your father has
a strange way of showing it.

549
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,279
Why do you say that?

550
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,011
He's never made me feel
that Meg and I are welcome here.

551
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,929
It could be you who's at fault.

552
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,041
L?

553
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,406
How so my Lady?

554
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,400
I've heard of your trouble making
in the dormitory.

555
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:03,569
I'm Walter Blunt told
only one side of the story.

556
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:05,929
And I saw what happened
in the library.

557
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,407
Did you also see your father's anger
when I looked in the book of heraldry?

558
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:14,320
The coat of arms you were seeking
is not in the book.

559
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,330
Meg described it to me.

560
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,005
Did you look well?

561
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,846
Are you sure there's nothing
resembling a ring?

562
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:23,441
Nothing.

563
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:29,083
But strangely, there was
a page torn from the book.

564
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:31,206
Lady Anne!

565
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,206
Lady Anne!

566
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,047
Lady Anne!

567
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,210
It's you Dame Ellen,

568
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:47,364
your voice sounded so hoarse
I hardly recognized it.

569
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:50,929
-Your father wishes you to come.
-I'll come at once.

570
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,241
But dear Dame Ellen,

571
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:55,563
do hurry away from that window.
You'll surely take a chill.

572
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,371
-You must go quickly.
-Nlay I visit you again?

573
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:08,450
-You know my father forbids it.
-Do you?

574
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,410
Even if I did, anybody
foolhardy enough to ride windmills

575
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:13,885
would pay little heed.

576
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:26,361
Hurry.

577
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,849
We'll be back tomorrow.

578
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,201
His ankle?

579
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:56,241
As for De Ramsey,

580
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:59,489
he shows ability with the sword
but lacks intelligence.

581
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:00,961
He takes after his father.

582
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,001
As for Myles of Crispy-Dale...

583
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:06,761
-What of that bear cub?
-During the weeks he's been here

584
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,048
I've shown him increased attention.

585
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:12,125
-His progress is as slow as that?
-On the contrary my Lord.

586
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,083
He's alert, fast and courageous.

587
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,970
And since his fight with Blunt

588
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,163
the esquires look to him
as their leader.

589
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:21,250
-Many a lad shows talent.
-Not like this one.

590
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:23,164
He has the makings of a champion.

591
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,203
Were he of noble blood...

592
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:30,247
As it is he will make a fine
Man At Arms of the Castle Guard.

593
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,405
As for young Hen slow...

594
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,363
-Sir James.
-Yes my Lord.

595
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:38,124
This Myles of Crispy-Dale,

596
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:41,161
have his roughness
smoothed and polished,

597
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,841
let him be instructed
in the gentler arts.

598
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:46,004
The gentler arts?

599
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:50,206
Do you wish me to discontinue
his instruction as a Man At Arms?

600
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:51,810
On the contrary Sir James.

601
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,607
I want him worked twice as hard
as any of the others.

602
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:56,645
And if he drops from exhaustion,

603
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:00,049
revive him and work him
again and again.

604
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:05,844
I want to know
if his spirit can be broken.

605
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,282
As my Lord commands.

606
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:18,968
No, no, no!
You do not pour the wine now.

607
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:22,128
A late comer.

608
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:25,164
What may I ask is the reason
for your delay?

609
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:27,249
At least 20 reasons,
Sir George.

610
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:30,171
First, fetching the water,
then, polishing the armor,

611
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,690
then, working with at the pels,

612
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:34,166
then cleaning out the stables,
then helping the blacksmith,

613
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:36,009
-then currying...
-Enough, enough.

614
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:38,208
It's a miracle you got here at all.

615
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:40,730
Where were we?
Oh yes.

616
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:45,011
Who can tell me why the wine
should not be served now?

617
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:51,645
The food scraps should be
cleared from the table first.

618
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:57,562
Excellent Francis. At table,
all should be kept dainty and tidy.

619
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:59,609
Do it Myles.

620
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,249
There. isn't that better?

621
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,125
Now, the wine.

622
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,723
It's these little things

623
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:17,043
that distinguish the gentleman
from the swineherd.

624
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,324
That will be all.

625
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,761
Try to remember
what I taught you,

626
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:32,282
elegance, elegance...

627
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:34,080
Elegance.

628
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:36,721
Dismissed.

629
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,924
I'm sorry. It was an accident.
Someone jostled my arm.

630
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:49,961
Idiot!

631
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:06,363
I don't fight like a peasant,
farm boy.

632
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:50,761
Myles.

633
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:59,883
-Stop it! Stop it I say.
-No, Sir James.

634
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:03,251
-Let them fight.
-This could be to the death.

635
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:05,328
I said let them fight.

636
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:08,642
Get him to the infirmary.
You, come with me.

637
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,481
Go on boy.
Get someone to carry him.

638
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,281
Close the door.

639
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:27,481
I take it on myself that
I let the fight continue.

640
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:31,646
If AIban's brother dies neither
you nor my house will go unpunished.

641
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,561
Then why didn't
your Lordship try to stop us?

642
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,081
I'll tell you why.

643
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:39,642
Because you were
hoping to see me kill.

644
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:42,330
Why would I hope for such a thing?

645
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:44,568
If I knew that I'd have
the answer to many riddles.

646
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:47,087
My father was supposed
to have been your friend,

647
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:49,442
but from the day I arrived
at Nlackworth Castle

648
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:51,961
I've been treated more
like the son of an enemy.

649
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:55,091
I'll take your punishment
and go my Lord.

650
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,881
You go nowhere
without my permission.

651
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:00,530
And since you like
to fight so much,

652
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:03,291
your punishment shall be
that you get your fill of it.

653
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:06,887
You're leaving
the company of esquires

654
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,881
to begin training for knighthood.

655
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:17,200
-For knighthood?
-Report to Sir James and quickly

656
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:20,922
before I recall the insolent manner
in which you dared address me.

657
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:24,640
Yes my Lord.

658
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:33,326
How does it feel?

659
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,041
Good.

660
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:39,289
Not too heavy, it weighs 70 pounds.
Walk around.

661
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:46,529
-Light as a feather.
-I'm glad, for your sake.

662
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:49,088
Because you're to wear it
every hour of the day

663
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:50,890
except when sleeping.

664
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:52,806
But why?

665
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:00,491
Get to your feet.

666
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:04,366
Get to your feet.

667
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:05,926
The armor...

668
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:09,011
it's light as a feather.
You told me so yourself.

669
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,091
Get up I say.

670
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:17,646
You understand now
why you must wear it constantly.

671
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:21,249
You must grow used to it,
as if it were a second skin.

672
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:24,211
You'll have to ride in it,
run in it and fight in it.

673
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,721
Right now I wish
I could just stand up.

674
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:29,561
Pick him up.

675
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:43,491
At least you look like a knight.

676
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:46,047
Don't get in any fights
and no one will know the difference.

677
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:50,169
If Lady Anne could see you know...

678
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:52,886
She would see a gentleman
most fair and valiant.

679
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:54,969
Myles, it's beautiful.

680
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:01,124
-But can you climb a wall in that?
-Lady Anne!

681
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:12,964
Wonder why Nlackworth trains
a farm boy for knighthood.

682
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:17,689
I think I'll ask leave
to visit King Henry's court.

683
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:21,091
I'd like a little talk
with my brother.

684
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:29,524
-You think yourself a good horseman?
-I was the best in Crispy-Dale.

685
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:30,687
Were you now?

686
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:34,247
When one has said that of course,
one has said everything.

687
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,004
Do you think you could ride
in and out between those pels.

688
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:40,846
-Of course.
-Put your hands above your shoulders.

689
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,125
Come on. Both of them.

690
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:44,641
Keep them there.

691
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:46,410
Now in and out.

692
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:51,921
Come back here.

693
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:59,721
I said between the pels
not past them.

694
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:01,888
But how can I guide my horse
without touching the reigns?

695
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:03,610
Hasn't it occurred to you
that in combat

696
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:06,565
one hand will hold
the shield and reigns.

697
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:09,121
If you should move your shield,
you may very well drop these.

698
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,929
Then how will my horse
know where to go?

699
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:12,844
Unless he has more brains than I?

700
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,207
A possibility not so remote
as you may imagine.

701
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:17,409
He will know by
the pressure of your knees

702
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:19,444
and the sting of your spurs.

703
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:22,769
Don't you understand that
champion of Crispy-Dale?

704
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:24,161
Yes sir.

705
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:25,401
Before your done

706
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:27,966
you'll be able to guide
this horse forward, back,

707
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,401
right and left.
Come on. Try again.

708
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:36,205
Give him the spur man.

709
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,209
Give him the spur.

710
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:54,571
Forward, back,
right or left...

711
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:57,281
You didn't say anything
about up or down.

712
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:00,370
Beautifully ridden!

713
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:03,050
Fetch me another lance.

714
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:06,290
We'll see if it was skill
or luck that guided his arm.

715
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:12,483
Sir James intends to cross lances
with you a second time.

716
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,842
This is a very great compliment.

717
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:54,884
Well done.

718
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:01,321
And then for the first time
in all these months

719
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:03,807
Sir James actually
clapped me on the back.

720
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:06,567
For Sir James that's
an ecstasy of approval, isn't it?

721
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:08,484
But then he got a grip
on himself and said,

722
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:10,927
"l may take you with me
to the wars in France.

723
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:13,407
You will make the French
laugh themselves to death."

724
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:18,400
I hadn't thought of you
as going to France.

725
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:22,211
Would you miss me?

726
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:24,761
Very much.

727
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:30,366
Sir James told me that Walter Blunt
had been knighted by the king.

728
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:33,000
I know.

729
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:36,284
He boasted before he left

730
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:39,165
that after his knighthood
he would return to marry you.

731
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:42,644
Myles,
need we speak of this now?

732
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:44,560
I must.

733
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:48,642
When I first began
visiting you here,

734
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:52,251
I didn't know
I was going to fall in love.

735
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:54,121
Myles.

736
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:58,647
I know you're the daughter of a peer,
while I don't even know who I am.

737
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:00,929
Perhaps I haven't
the right to love you.

738
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:06,323
You're luckier than I.
I haven't the right to love anyone.

739
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:10,523
What kind of man is your father?

740
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:12,564
To gain favor
with the Earl of Alban

741
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:14,091
he trades you in marriage.

742
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,487
It is not for us
to question my father.

743
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:18,170
Then I question you.

744
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:20,881
Do you intend
to marry Walter Blunt?

745
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:25,484
Don't torture me Myles.

746
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:27,600
I will go to your father.

747
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:30,485
No please...

748
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:33,247
Don't spoil what happiness
there is for us.

749
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:35,887
Am I always to come to you
then like a thief

750
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:38,208
over walls,
up the back stairs?

751
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:40,482
Is that your idea of love?

752
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,001
My darling,

753
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:47,289
it is all that is mine to give.

754
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:51,443
Anne, when I loved you less
it was enough

755
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:54,400
but no longer.

756
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:00,201
Anne!

757
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:17,443
I have appointed Giles to replace
Blunt as senior esquire.

758
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:18,601
Good.

759
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:20,762
He is certainly better liked
and the men...

760
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,162
You there! Come here!

761
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,170
How long has this been going on?

762
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:41,204
Your Lordship, I...

763
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:42,765
Out with it. I want the truth.

764
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:45,409
Nearly every week for the past year.

765
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:47,802
This time you've gone too far.

766
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:50,761
I shall give you
good reason to regret it.

767
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:59,284
Sir Alexander,
what brings you here?

768
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:01,010
I thought you
accompanied his Majesty.

769
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,248
King Henry rides
a few leagues behind me.

770
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:05,642
He comes to visit
Nlackworth Castle for a few days.

771
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:08,446
-How many ride with him?
-A small party.

772
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:11,929
The Prince of Wales, Count Vermois,
the ambassador from Burgundy

773
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:15,806
I know De Vermois. In joust he has
unseated many a good English knight.

774
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:18,686
The Earl of Alban and his brother
are also with the king.

775
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:21,640
Alban coming here?

776
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:23,769
It was he who suggested this visit.

777
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:29,447
Inform his Majesty all shall be
done to make his stay a pleasant one.

778
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:36,766
Myles.

779
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:41,802
Go to your quarters. Remain there
until I decide on a punishment.

780
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:50,009
I may turn this visit into something
Alban did not intend.

781
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:56,409
She's her father's daughter,
as unpredictable as the wind.

782
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:58,961
-One minute...
-Give a thought to the punishment.

783
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:01,841
-At least worry a little.
-I care not.

784
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:03,685
Then I'll do the worrying.

785
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:05,962
There's the thumb screw,
the rack.

786
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:09,568
They may hack off your ears,
or even string you up by your...

787
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:10,601
Myles!

788
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:15,684
I have just left his Lordship.

789
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:19,566
He commands that you are to joust
tomorrow with Count De Vermois.

790
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:22,530
Against the champion of Burgundy?

791
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:25,610
Do I detect a note of
reluctance in your voice?

792
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:27,205
Are you afraid?

793
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:29,808
It's not a question of fear.

794
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:33,004
If his Lordship wants to punish me
that is his privilege

795
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:34,730
but I'll not
let him make a fool of me.

796
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:36,205
Then stop talking like one.

797
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:38,409
This is not a matter of punishment.

798
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:41,969
King Henry wishes to see some sport
and his Lordship has selected

799
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,446
-you to represent Nlackworth Castle.
-Why me?

800
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:47,211
It is not for you to question
his Lordship's reasons.

801
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:49,405
Hear me boy.

802
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:52,802
I've worked harder with you
than with any I've ever trained.

803
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:55,043
Do you think I'd let it go for not

804
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:58,448
in one joust merely to please
a whim of his Lordship?

805
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:01,607
You think I stand a chance
against Vermois?

806
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:05,123
I have assured Lord Nlackworth
that you can defeat him.

807
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:07,850
-I will do my best Sir James.
-Good.

808
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:09,325
I have one request.

809
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:11,404
Francis Gascoyne
shall serve as my squire.

810
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:12,481
Yes, yes.

811
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:16,162
Prepare yourselves quickly. The King
will receive you in the great hall.

812
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:51,806
-So this is your man?
-Yes, your Majesty.

813
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:54,604
He seems hardly more than a lad.

814
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:56,804
I assure you,
Count de Vermois

815
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:59,082
he will give good account
of himself on the morrow.

816
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:00,924
I hope so my Lord Nlackwonh.

817
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:04,483
I've had my fill of watching
English knights go down

818
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:06,404
before the Count de Vermois.

819
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:10,331
My brother tells me you're from
one of my own villages, Crispy-Dale.

820
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:11,567
Yes my Lord.

821
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:14,485
-By what name are you known?
-Myles.

822
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:17,207
Myles what?
Surely you've another name.

823
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:20,522
I use but one name, Myles.

824
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:22,566
You hear that Count de Vermois?

825
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:24,690
You face a mysterious knight
with but one name

826
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:27,371
Sir Myles and nothing more.
I like that.

827
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:29,450
It intrigues my romantic nature.

828
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:31,523
With your Majesty's indulgence,

829
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:35,486
it is not Sir Myles.
This person has not been knighted.

830
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:36,599
Nlackwonh,

831
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:38,682
you can't expect a nobleman
to cross lances with one

832
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:41,331
who has not yet
earned his spurs.

833
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:42,961
Nly apologies your Majesty.

834
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:45,931
My delight in finding
so able an opponent

835
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:47,730
caused me to forget it.

836
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:50,122
You'll have to provide
another challenger.

837
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:51,721
Sire.

838
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:54,965
I know more about the wines
of Burgundy than its knights

839
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:59,442
but it would be excellent sport
to see their champion tumbled.

840
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:03,127
Should it please his Majesty
I'll test my lance against the count.

841
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:05,208
Come now Alban,
the laws of chivalry

842
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:07,004
require our host to name
his champion.

843
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:08,645
Choose another Nlackwonh.

844
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:13,364
I have no other who can hope
to take the measure of the Count.

845
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:15,321
Sire!

846
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:18,007
Is it not worthwhile
conferring a knighthood

847
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:20,089
to see the Count defeated?

848
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:22,886
So be it.

849
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:25,370
Have the candidate prepared.

850
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:30,722
I will confer knighthood on him
before the joust tomorrow.

851
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:54,081
Myles.

852
01:07:57,360 --> 01:07:58,646
I must speak with you.

853
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:00,723
I can speak to no one until morning.

854
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,890
I must spend the night in the chapel
standing vigil over my armor.

855
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,725
I ask for only a moment.

856
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:07,925
Meg and I will go ahead.

857
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,002
I will set your armor
before the altar.

858
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:18,011
Yesterday we did leave
each other with cruel words.

859
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:20,762
I would they
had never been spoken.

860
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:24,166
What does it avail us
to regret the words?

861
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,286
The castle buzzes with

862
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:28,522
the great honor paid
the house of Nlackwonh.

863
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:31,565
The King himself is here
to announce your betrothal to

864
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:33,291
Walter Blunt.

865
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:37,962
Once I gave you my favor lightly

866
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:41,806
now wear it in earnest tomorrow
when you are knighted.

867
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:45,282
From this it will
be recognized as mine.

868
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:49,765
I want Walter, the King, my father
all to know it is you I love.

869
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:54,562
He shows your favor on his arm.

870
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:57,805
He honors me by wearing it.

871
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:10,002
You that desire to receive
the order of knighthood

872
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:13,449
swear now always to be loyal to
your King who bestows it upon you.

873
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:16,200
Swear also to maintain
and defend the weak

874
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:19,290
and to shun no adventure
of your person in battle.

875
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:23,041
I swear.

876
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:27,724
In nomine Patris et Fillii

877
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:29,126
et Spiritu Sancti.

878
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:30,606
Amen.

879
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:56,922
Sir Myles,

880
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:13,521
Sir Myles,

881
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:17,363
since yourjoust
is to be a friendly combat

882
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:21,366
it is not amiss that you meet
your opponent before crossing lances.

883
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,764
My congratulations Sir Myles.

884
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:28,927
It is a pity that
your moment of glory

885
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:32,761
will be followed so soon
by your moment of disaster.

886
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:34,806
Thank you Sir knight.

887
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:37,130
Your victory is assured,

888
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:40,046
if your arm is as mighty
as your tongue.

889
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:44,044
LVly Lord Nlackworth

890
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:46,444
Sir Myles carries no shield.

891
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:49,202
Is he to fight under
your coat of arms?

892
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:51,209
No sire. Under his own.

893
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:01,281
Your Majesty!

894
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:04,531
That is the black shield and
scarlet gryphon of Falworth.

895
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:05,721
Falworth?

896
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:08,368
The name is not entirely strange.

897
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:10,164
Your Majesty himself
had him declared outlaw.

898
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:11,600
A traitor to the crown.

899
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:15,765
No man in England was more loyal
to you than the Earl of Falworth.

900
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:17,884
This knight is his son.

901
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:20,169
Then is he under sentence of death.

902
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:23,841
-As all who bear the name Falworth.
-Seize him.

903
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:28,845
And what of Nlackwonh,
your Majesty?

904
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:31,642
Harboring traitors
is an act of treason.

905
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:33,961
There was
no treason in my heart

906
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:36,282
only a desire for justice.

907
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:40,281
We will let the high court
of chivalry decide.

908
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:43,046
I shall order it convened at once.

909
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:46,844
Meanwhile my Lord,
you and Sir Myles,

910
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:49,407
will remain under guard
in the castle.

911
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:00,362
I was in France when the charge
of treason was brought against him.

912
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:05,244
Before he could defend himself
he was slain by his accuser.

913
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:07,605
The Earl of Alban.

914
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:09,321
Alban?

915
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:11,124
His reward was
your father's property,

916
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:14,365
the castles and estates that
rightfully belong to you two.

917
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:17,843
Why was I not told this before?

918
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:22,167
Because like your father,
you have the devil's own temper.

919
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:25,286
One unguarded word
would have been our undoing.

920
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:27,090
So Alban lives

921
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:30,687
and it is you who have denied
me the chance to kill him.

922
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:32,210
I have given you the chance.

923
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:35,086
Why do you think your training
has been so ruthless?

924
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:38,331
Why I had Sir James teach you
every skill he knows?

925
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:41,769
Why we tricked the King into
conferring knighthood upon you?

926
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:46,006
For when you had to challenge
England's most powerful knight.

927
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:49,251
With the gallows facing us?
With guards at every door?

928
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:51,800
I foresaw this when
we revealed your identity.

929
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:54,844
When they take you before the court

930
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:57,611
it is your right to clear
your family name.

931
01:13:57,960 --> 01:13:59,200
As the son of Falworth, you are

932
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:03,171
the one man with cause to challenge
Alban to trial by combat.

933
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:07,445
But what will happen to you
and the Lady Anne, my Lord?

934
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:11,763
When Myles vindicates the name
of Falworth, he vindicates me

935
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:15,610
And leaves Anne free to give
her heart where she will.

936
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,970
But you make no mention that
it may be Myles who is slain.

937
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:22,725
In all your planning
did you think of this?

938
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:26,283
Now when there is no turning back
you tell him of your intrigue.

939
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:29,006
Why was he not told while
the choice was still his?

940
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:31,084
Why was I not told?

941
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:33,409
I would have
gone away with you Myles.

942
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:35,369
We could have
found happiness somewhere.

943
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:38,240
And let the name of Falworth
stay forgotten.

944
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:40,568
I have no right to happiness

945
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:43,242
until my father's death is avenged.

946
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:46,411
Oh I wish you'd never come
to Nlackworth Castle.

947
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:49,083
That you'd remained as you were.

948
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:51,283
And never learned of your birth.

949
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:57,402
Then I would not have met you.

950
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:05,965
I am grateful to you my Lord.

951
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:09,849
You have given purpose to my life.

952
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:13,369
A great purpose Sir Myles.

953
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:16,969
AIban's death will end
the ring of evil around King Henry.

954
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:20,487
The fate of the realm
rides on your lance.

955
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:33,480
You will come with me.

956
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:36,724
I fancy you'll find the dungeon
more to your peasant taste.

957
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:37,961
Dungeon?

958
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:40,409
LVly brother pointed out
to King Henry

959
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:43,523
that Sir Myles is already
under sentence of death.

960
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:45,564
There is no reason to try him.

961
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:48,167
As a knight of the realm
he has the right to be heard.

962
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:50,562
His rights are being observed.

963
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:53,208
We're already building the gallows.

964
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:09,925
Those are the facts.

965
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:12,564
Therefore my lords

966
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:16,327
I accuse the Earl of Nlackworth
of obstructing the King's justice

967
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:19,000
by helping the family
of an adjudged traitor.

968
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:22,010
Again I deny the Earl of Falworth
was guilty of any treason.

969
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:23,889
But you do not deny harboring
his two children

970
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:25,524
knowing they were
under sentence of death.

971
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:27,005
No, that I do not deny.

972
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:32,042
From his own lips.
Nlackworth stands convicted.

973
01:16:34,760 --> 01:16:37,604
Let him pass.
He is here at the Prince's command.

974
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:45,488
Your Majesty,
my gracious lords.

975
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:47,000
Who released this man?

976
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:51,369
I did, in your name sire.

977
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:54,450
So that justice might be done.

978
01:16:55,640 --> 01:16:58,120
I do here and now deny
that my father was a traitor.

979
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:01,724
And I proclaim that his accuser
Gilbert of Alban

980
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:03,842
is a foul
and an attainted liar.

981
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,606
And I offer to prove the truth
of what I say in combat.

982
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:10,482
I hereby cast down my gage,
Gilbert of Alban.

983
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:14,881
Stop.

984
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:18,002
Once take up the gage Lord Alban

985
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:20,601
and the matter
passes from this court.

986
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:22,400
Let it lie.

987
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:26,009
Unless your content to let
heaven judge the issue

988
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:28,489
in trial by combat.

989
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:33,762
Fail to take it up my Lord and
you'll stand branded not only a liar

990
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:35,725
but a coward.

991
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:38,286
Your Majesty

992
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:40,808
the ways of heaven
are a mystery to me

993
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:43,489
but of my own prowess

994
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:46,208
I have no doubt.

995
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:51,087
So be it.

996
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:54,969
The issue between you
shall be decided in combat

997
01:17:56,920 --> 01:17:58,809
and may God defend the right.

998
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:15,607
With my Men At Arms
in Nlackworth Castle sire

999
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:18,766
we need have no further fears
for your safety.

1000
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:23,048
LVly son is not the first heir to
a throne to plot against his father.

1001
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:25,886
I pray my suspicions
are unfounded sire.

1002
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:29,484
He revealed that the fool
and the drunkard were a masquerade.

1003
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:34,089
As you said all that has happened
here is part of a conspiracy.

1004
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:36,284
Who knows where it will end?

1005
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:39,722
I leave my safety in your hands.

1006
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:42,444
With my life sire.

1007
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:49,204
LVly Lord,
by your Highness' leave

1008
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:51,968
I have just completed a tour
of the sentry posts.

1009
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:54,322
Our guards have been disarmed
by order of the King.

1010
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:57,320
AIban's men have
taken over every gate.

1011
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:05,724
Tell me again what speech
you had with Walter Blunt.

1012
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:08,046
Speak girl!

1013
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:11,130
Walter came to me with an offer.

1014
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:14,171
He said if I married him,
your life would be spared.

1015
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:17,364
He said after tomorrow only
his brother could grant you a pardon.

1016
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:19,728
Alban is brash
as well as confident.

1017
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:21,803
It is the King's prerogative
to grant pardons.

1018
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,731
But he spoke as if there
were no king, only Alban.

1019
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:27,802
You must leave the castle at once,
your Highness.

1020
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:31,406
Alban is ambitious enough
to aspire to the throne itself.

1021
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,409
Tomorrow, you, the King,

1022
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:35,767
the High Court, everyone
who stands in his way

1023
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:38,844
will be assembled in one group
at the mercy of his Men At Arms.

1024
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:40,930
We underrated him.

1025
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:43,569
This we did not foresee.

1026
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:48,323
Sir James,
have they also disarmed the squires?

1027
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:51,125
Of what avail are untried boys
against seasoned Men At Arms?

1028
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:52,924
But they have been trained
by Sir James.

1029
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:55,367
They also will be outnumbered
by three to one.

1030
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:57,528
We must get word
to Sir Hubert and the others.

1031
01:19:57,640 --> 01:20:00,166
Your Highness is the only man
who can get through that gate.

1032
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:02,329
Even Alban will not
dare to stop you.

1033
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:05,723
More important with the heir
to the throne away from here

1034
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:08,008
it might forestall his treachery.

1035
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:09,725
The saints willing my Lord

1036
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:11,810
tomorrow I shall
put an end to it forever.

1037
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:13,080
To assist the saints

1038
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:15,930
I shall return with loyal
Men At Arms before you face him.

1039
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:18,440
Whatever happens here

1040
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:22,330
I would like to know my Anne
is safe, and Meg.

1041
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:24,564
-Take them with you.
-I'll not go.

1042
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:26,329
-Nor I.
-Francis.

1043
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:29,931
Tell Dame Ellen
to bring their traveling cloaks.

1044
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:31,320
And make haste!

1045
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,731
I envy his Highness
the pleasure of your company.

1046
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:49,121
Open the gate.

1047
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:51,965
LVly orders are that your Highness
is not to leave.

1048
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:55,409
Does the Earl of Alban dare issue
orders against a prince of the realm?

1049
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:57,289
The order is from his Majesty.

1050
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:01,729
You'd best return to your apartments.

1051
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:12,048
Your Highness,
what of Sir Hubert?

1052
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:14,728
AIban's trap is tightly closed.

1053
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:17,125
I shall be with your father.

1054
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:24,088
Dame Ellen, find Sir Walter Blunt.
Tell him to come to me in the garden.

1055
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:30,490
If you have the love for me
you claim, prove it.

1056
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,162
Why this sudden
change of heart my Lady?

1057
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:36,091
When last I saw you, I offered
to intercede for your father

1058
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:37,886
and you sent me away.

1059
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:40,008
I was sick with worry,
beyond thinking.

1060
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:43,410
Or is it that you expect me
to ask mercy for Myles Falworth?

1061
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:47,681
I ask only for my father's freedom.

1062
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:52,441
Your ardor for the farm boy
seems suddenly diminished.

1063
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:57,205
I didn't know he was a traitor
and would bring harm to my father.

1064
01:21:57,640 --> 01:22:00,120
If it rested with me, the gallows
would face him tomorrow.

1065
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:02,163
Instead of
an honorable end in combat.

1066
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:06,605
Either way,
you'll forget him in time.

1067
01:22:07,960 --> 01:22:10,088
It would be easier if I did not
have to witness his death.

1068
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:12,284
Help me leave here Walter.

1069
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:14,364
Await me at Alban Castle.

1070
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:17,001
Meanwhile I'll do all I can
for your father.

1071
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:19,371
You will find me grateful.

1072
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:23,887
I want more than
your gratitude Anne.

1073
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:30,051
-Nlay I take Dame Ellen to attend me?
-As you wish.

1074
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:34,124
-How soon can you be ready?
-I am ready now.

1075
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:41,126
-Dame Ellen,
-Yes, my Lady.

1076
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:42,805
Fetch my cape please.

1077
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:59,611
-Thank you.
-I'll pass you through the gates

1078
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:03,526
and arrange for two guards
to accompany you for your protection.

1079
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:32,760
We should be nearing Alban Castle.
What place is this?

1080
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,570
It is called Crispy-Dale.

1081
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:38,089
The ride has made me thirsty.
I see a farmhouse ahead.

1082
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:39,890
We shall stop there for water.

1083
01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:53,971
I'll fetch you some water.
Help me down.

1084
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:05,929
Guard, you may as well
water the horses.

1085
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:07,841
LVly Lady.

1086
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:24,687
Water for the Lady but
cool wine for Lord AIban's men.

1087
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:45,484
Quickly! And I pray we reach
Sir Hubert in time.

1088
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:20,241
If Alban intends treachery,
his men are place to advantage.

1089
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:24,641
-So are the Squires Sir James.
-Young fools.

1090
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:27,084
Without armor they'll be slaughtered.

1091
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:30,489
Had they worn armor they'd be
in the dungeon with the Men At Arms.

1092
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:38,723
Alban has chosen lance and axe.

1093
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:42,125
I shall use lance and sword.

1094
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:46,003
We shall soon see whether your time
with me has been wasted Sir James.

1095
01:25:47,080 --> 01:25:48,411
Nlay God ride with you.

1096
01:26:21,240 --> 01:26:22,605
What is your name?

1097
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:24,809
Why are you here?

1098
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:27,009
I am Myles Falworth

1099
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:31,769
and I am here to defend my challenge
upon the body of Gilbert of Alban.

1100
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:34,641
Proclaiming him
an unknightly knight

1101
01:26:34,920 --> 01:26:37,730
and a false
and perjured liar!

1102
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:40,370
Gilbert of Alban

1103
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:45,042
you be enterprised this day
to discharge sureties before the King

1104
01:26:45,160 --> 01:26:49,085
and to encounter in your defense
Myles Falworth, knight.

1105
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:51,966
Do your endeavor in God's name.

1106
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:24,243
-What treachery!
-Not mine sire.

1107
01:29:24,520 --> 01:29:26,045
Alban seeks your throne.

1108
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:03,284
I have long awaited this day
Sir Hubert.

1109
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:07,048
Lord Falworth is avenged and
the honor of his house vindicated.

1110
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:16,724
It shall be proclaimed
throughout the realm this day

1111
01:33:16,760 --> 01:33:20,128
a grateful king
has reinstated the name,

1112
01:33:20,360 --> 01:33:23,091
title and estates of Falworth,

1113
01:33:23,480 --> 01:33:25,881
together with all rights,

1114
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:28,964
honors and prerogatives
attached to said quality.

1115
01:33:38,120 --> 01:33:39,724
Henceforth, my Lord Falworth

1116
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:43,762
wear your father's
coat of arms

1117
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:48,687
as proudly
and honorably as did he.

1118
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:54,403
With your permission sire.

1119
01:33:56,160 --> 01:33:57,286
LVly Lord.

1120
01:34:11,080 --> 01:34:12,605
With your permission, my Lord.

1121
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:14,521
Sir Francis,

1122
01:34:15,680 --> 01:34:17,887
since you may be
too faint hearted to ask...

1123
01:34:18,980 --> 01:34:23,987
Done by:
TheKha & Shady
