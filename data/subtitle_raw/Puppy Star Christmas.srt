1
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:16,975
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here together

2
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:20,729
to celebrate the union
of two of my favorite pups.

3
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:22,689
Is this a fairy tale?

4
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:24,983
Is it love that I'm feeling?

5
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:28,528
Oh, pull it together, you two.
It's a wedding, not a funeral.

6
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,447
Oh, here. Ida, here.

7
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,115
- Gracias.
- It's gonna be okay.

8
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:37,245
Gracias.

9
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,833
So, come on, everybody, get on up,

10
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:46,004
and let's show these two
just how groovy puppy love can be.

Uh... Two fifty, still.

60
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,697
- They've been in there for hours.
- It's been five minutes.

61
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,574
Look, these things take time.

62
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:21,367
Okay? Just breathe.

63
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,953
Remember Lamaze class. Hee, hee...

64
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,168
- Good.
- I'm bugging out here.

65
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,878
- Wait.
- Tiny, I'm coming.

66
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:36,299
Just calm down, okay? Here, have a cigar.

67
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,092
What? I don't smoke.

68
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,637
- Yeah, I don't either, actually.
- I don't get it.

69
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,722
- Why do we have cigars?
- I don't know.

70
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:44,557
I got the call
that Tiny's having the puppies,

71
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,517
I ran to the car, fell, hit my head,

72
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:49,562
I was driving by a cigar shop,
and bought a bunch of cigars.

73
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:53,149
I have no idea what was going on, okay?
I'm on autopilot right now.

74
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,359
Would you just please...

75
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,861
calm down, P.U.P.?

76
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,239
Lou, Lou, Lou. The puppies.

77
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,324
- Are they--?
- Can't talk. Getting towels.

78
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,201
Shep, I'm dying out here.

79
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:04,661
- Tiny, is she--?
- Steven.

80
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:08,122
I'm sterilizing.
I don't have time for your melodrama.

81
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,832
- But wait--
- You're killing me.

82
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,168
- That goes for you, too, Papa.
- What--?

83
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,212
Ida, Tiny.

84
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:18,508
Tiny's doing great, Mr. Steven.
And the puppies are coming soon, too.

85
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:19,801
I'm already flipping my fur.

86
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:23,888
We can't bring the puppies into this world
to meet esta gente loca, can we?

87
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,099
- No. Yes. I mean, no.
- Cuckoo.

88
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:27,809
We're not loca. We're fine.

89
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:29,477
We're normal. We're not crazy.

90
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,187
- You're more cuckoo than that clock.
- Okay?

91
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:32,605
Cuckoo.

92
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,819
- Towels, incoming.
- Water to go.

93
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,028
- We have hot water.
- Hot.

94
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,238
- Hot water.
- Hot water.

95
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:41,698
Ah.

96
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:43,825
I need a nap.

97
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,164
Cuckoo.

98
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,339
Time to wake up, Papa.

99
00:04:58,464 --> 00:04:59,340
Hmm?

100
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:00,258
The puppies are here.

101
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,802
What happened? What--? Where--?

102
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,263
Three adorable girls.

103
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:08,891
Rosie, Charlie,
and the tiniest one, Cindy.

104
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:12,562
And a very handsome boy, Brody.

105
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:16,441
Aren't they
the most beautiful puppies ever?

106
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,192
Yes, they are, old pal.

107
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:21,195
Oh, my dog.

108
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,947
Tiny? Is she okay?

109
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,492
- Um...
- Well, come see for yourselves.

110
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:27,410
Come on.

111
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:36,586
How you doing, darling?

112
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:40,173
I can truly say
that I've never, ever been better.

113
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,968
We're going to be good parents, right?

114
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,264
We're gonna be awesome.

115
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:56,355
Those orphans have foiled Julio
for the last time.

116
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:05,782
Say it.

117
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:07,450
Say the line.

118
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,911
Holy frijoles, mi amoeba.

119
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,705
Evil just got a lot better-looking.

120
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:13,623
Cut.

121
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,874
Cut.

122
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:15,958
Finally.

123
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,545
Please, tell Julio he can start acting,
any time now.

124
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:20,588
Ai-yai-ai.

125
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,175
Lo siento, everybody.

126
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,427
The gringo is still adjusting.

127
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,304
If I'm so bad, why am I here?

128
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:29,889
Ratings, idiota.

129
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,516
You're like a car crash.

130
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,142
You miserable little imp.

131
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,645
I can't do this anymore.

132
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:39,357
Get these amateurs off my set.

133
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,401
This show won't last two episodes
without me.

134
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:43,611
Do you know who I am?

135
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,947
Yes.

136
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:50,201
An out-of-work gringo actor.

137
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,370
Somebody get me Casting.

138
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:53,830
I need two dogs.

139
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,207
One a medium, one a Chihuahua.

140
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,835
There is only one Julio.

141
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:05,133
How hard do you think it will be

142
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:07,760
to find a Chihuahua?

143
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:10,680
This is Mexico.

144
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:13,933
Uh... Wait, what?

145
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:16,811
What just happened? This is bad.

146
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,563
Julio is confused.

147
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,356
Wait, wait, wait.

148
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,816
I can play both parts.

149
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:22,900
I'll work for scale.

150
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,364
Come on, scaredy-cat.
Get in there and stamp it down.

151
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,575
This is so gross.

152
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:37,832
Hey.

153
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:38,749
Wait.

154
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,419
Kano. Something's moving in here.

155
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:42,920
Better keep stamping.

156
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:47,592
What the...?

157
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,347
Hey, you. Turn that camera off.

158
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:58,019
Oh, you think this is funny?

159
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:01,272
How's this for a headline?

160
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:04,025
"Hack reporter gets free ambulance ride."

161
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,530
You're watching DMZ.

162
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:11,908
Way to take a hit.

163
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,827
Glad it's you, and not me, Micky.
Looks rough.

164
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:16,537
Worth it.

165
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:18,581
You're a true journalist.

166
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,751
Mean Team, you're the ultimate losers.

167
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,255
Trash taking out trash, right?

168
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:29,383
And how do you get fired
from your own show?

169
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:30,593
Am I right, guys?

170
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:36,599
Just when you thought you couldn't
sink any lower than daytime TV.

171
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,601
I guess crime doesn't pay.

172
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,269
You said-- What do you mean?

173
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:46,651
- Charlie, Rosie, Cindy.
- What's up, Bro?

174
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:48,903
You will not believe
what's going on in the kitchen.

175
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:51,697
- Breathe, Brody, breathe.
- Come on, come on.

176
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,702
Mm. Turkey time.

177
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:02,166
- Mm. Yes.
- You know, when I first came to America,

178
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,044
I thought you were all loco
with the Thanksgiving.

179
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,754
Pero now... Whoo.

180
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,632
I love the pumpkin pie.

181
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,717
Yes. Mmm.

182
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:14,804
Oh! Mr. Steven.
You will spoil your dinner.

183
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:15,763
Okay.

184
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:16,681
Okay.

185
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,058
Hot.

186
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,309
Oy, no, no, no.

187
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:23,104
It says right here
in my Julia Child cookbook,

188
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:25,773
you cannot start carving for 15 minutes.

189
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,400
Okay, okay.

190
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,443
- Mm-hm.
- Let's set the table.

191
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:32,613
Yes, I love the Thanksgiving table.

192
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,241
Bro,
I think you just found the mother lode.

193
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:38,202
It smells so delicious.

194
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:41,622
Forget how it smells, Rosie.
I wanna know how it tastes.

195
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,457
Brody, we can't do that.

196
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,667
What if it's poisoned?

197
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,794
What are you even talking about, Brody?

198
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:50,673
I know.
What if I take a bite, and test it first?

199
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:54,093
If there's no poison,
it's just a teensy bite, right?

200
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,887
But if there is, I'm a hero.

201
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,473
You know that doesn't make any sense,
right?

202
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:09,650
Come on.

203
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:12,528
The puppies' first Thanksgiving.

204
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,031
I can't believe it's already here.

205
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:18,242
It's kind of magical,
seeing a holiday through our pups' eyes.

206
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:21,162
Heh. When I was their age,
I was on the streets.

207
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,456
Spitting rhymes and hustling full-time.

208
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,133
Oh, man.

209
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:37,803
My first bite of turkey. Hallelujah.

210
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,889
Brody, is it poisoned?

211
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,474
Uh... I can't tell.

212
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,768
I, uh... gotta keep checking.

213
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,854
- Hey, he can't stop eating.
- So good.

214
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,939
He's got golden retriever fever.

215
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,527
Uh-oh.

216
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:56,280
I told you, guys, this was a bad idea.

217
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:59,075
Well, we can't let it go to waste.

218
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,951
We've gotta hide the evidence.

219
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:06,624
Now... where's that pie?

220
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,462
Guys, snap out of it.

221
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:13,839
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's going on in here?

222
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:18,761
Uh, happy Thanksgiving, loving family.

223
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,849
- My pumpkin pie.
- It's...

224
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,226
What the...?

225
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:26,644
Come on.

226
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,896
I know what this looks like, but...

227
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,231
Great news.

228
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,733
The turkey isn't poisoned.

229
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,236
It was all Brody's idea.

230
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,946
He's the mastermind.

231
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,948
- Oh.
- Bus chucker.

232
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:39,865
Turkey hucker.

233
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,118
Stop snitching.

234
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,370
Rule número uno:

235
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,247
Never admit guilt.

236
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,373
We plead the Fifth.

237
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,750
Grandpa Steve, you're our lawyer.

238
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,377
- What?
- Well, I'm the judge,

239
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:52,962
they're the hungry jury,

240
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:55,464
and you're all doing time in your room.

241
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:02,680
Tough love, sis.
I'm telling you, it works.

242
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:05,057
It's not like them to act out like this.

243
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,977
Maybe we're not spending enough time
with them.

244
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,353
That's a possibility.

245
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,356
We have been spending a lot of time
at the studio.

246
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:15,693
And the live shows, and the galas,
and the...

247
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,278
Oh, jeez.

248
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:19,989
Oh, no. We're deadbeat parents.

249
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,575
You can spend some quality time with them.

250
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:26,495
And you could create
your own family traditions.

251
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,789
Lou, you genius.

252
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,876
Pup Star: A Puppy Star Christmas.

253
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:35,421
Oh! Chestpups Roasting on an Open...

254
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:37,548
We'll circle back to the title.

255
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,926
But, headline, "ratings gold."

256
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:43,679
Lou, you always have the best advice.

257
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:47,016
A little family time will turn those pups
right around.

258
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,351
In that case,
I think it's time we taught them

259
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,811
about the Christmas spirit.

260
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:54,690
Family, sharing,
and not destroying my turkey.

261
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,442
Or my pumpkin pie.

262
00:12:58,736 --> 00:12:59,945
Why are they so uptight?

263
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,199
Either way,
that turkey was going to get eaten.

264
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:06,368
And Ida's pie was delicious.

265
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,913
Guys, you're missing the point here.

266
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,164
Uh...

267
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:11,790
You're right, sis.

268
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:16,170
We didn't even get to taste
Grandpa Steven's world-famous stuffing.

269
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:18,297
That's not what I meant.

270
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,884
Ida and Grandpa worked really hard,
getting dinner ready.

271
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:25,304
Maybe we didn't consider the consequences.

272
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:27,723
No, that can't be it.

273
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,267
Quick. Uh...

274
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,936
Look like we learned something.

275
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:38,567
I think all of yous need
to apologize to Grandpa.

276
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:41,529
We're sorry, Ida and Grandpa Steven.

277
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:46,075
I guess we just couldn't
resist your amazing cooking.

278
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,159
Aw...

279
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:49,912
- It's hard to argue with that, right?
- Right, yeah.

280
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:50,871
Okay.

281
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,415
What Grandpa means to say is...

282
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:54,667
Right.

283
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,252
We all make mistakes.

284
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,546
The important thing
is that we recognize them

285
00:13:58,629 --> 00:13:59,630
and not repeat them.

286
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:00,548
Yeah.

287
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:04,426
Roll back.
I think I missed something here.

288
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:08,222
Well, pups,
Christmas is just around the corner,

289
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:11,058
and it's time you learned
the true meaning of Christmas.

290
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:14,812
Grandpa Steven's going
to read you his favorite Christmas book.

291
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,106
Santa and the Naughty Elf.

292
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:18,857
Uh...

293
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:22,695

This is not so bad.

369
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,386
You wouldn't understand.

370
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:36,263
You're used to living in trash.

371
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:39,558
And now I'm used to living with trash.

372
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,062
You've been zinged.

373
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:46,690
I crack myself up.

374
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,820
If it wasn't for Tiny
and that fleabag rapper,

375
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,363
I'd own Pup Star.

376
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,661
Allow me to introduce the Purina czarina,

377
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,331
the furshionista that is fur,

378
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:04,792
the canine queen
and everything in between--

379
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,127
Just-- Just let them talk.

380
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,338
Okay. I mean...

381
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,923
Happy holidays, everybody.

382
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,260
Is there no end to my humiliation?

383
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,348
Pup Star and Dawg Pound Records

384
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,143
are proud to present
the first ever Pup Star Christmas Special.

385
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:26,647
Our friends will be there.
Scrappy, Lady Paw Paw...

386
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,023
Julio, translate.

387
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,400
You still can't speak Spanish?

388
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,404
Learn the language, Americano.

389
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:37,074
Listen, I have minions to speak it for me.

390
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:38,492
Minions like you.

391
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:39,785
Okay, so, he's saying...

392
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:43,038
Tiny's putting on
a Pup Star Christmas special

393
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,706
in honor of her new familia.

394
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:50,921
But props to our main man, Shep,
for booking us the best guest star ever.

395
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:52,673
We got Santa Claus.

396
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:53,924
You got Santa?

397
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:55,217
We have Santa?

398
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:56,885
With special guest...

399
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,304
- Santa Claus?
- Santa Claus.

400
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:06,395
Uh, surely my invitation
has simply been lost in the e-mail. Heh.

401
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,272
Well, well, well.

402
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:11,024
Julio, what's bigger than Christmas?

403
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,025
Nothing.

404
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,862
It is the most sacred of holidays.

405
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:18,490
Unless there was a Julio de Mayo,
of course.

406
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:36,717
Don't blame yourself, Charlie.

407
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,010
Chess is a tough game.

408
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,846
Minutes to learn, years to master.

409
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:44,099
Hey, look, Ida has a charcuterie board.

410
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:46,894
Sweet cheeses and meat.

411
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,022
For you, Shep.

412
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:52,024
Charlie, what are you doing?

413
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:53,317
That's cheating.

414
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:56,403
Shh. Go be a Goody Two-shoes
somewhere else, Cindy.

415
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,322
I'm fleecing this rube.

416
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:00,741
- Mm.
- Checkmate.

417
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:06,955
Hang in there, Uncle Shep.
Your luck will change.

418
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:10,250
Best seven out of 13?

419
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,294

You're a natural.

427
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,398
Yes, Rosie.

428
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:36,735
Okay, okay, I know what you're thinking.

429
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:38,195
Star power.

430
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:39,279
It factor.

431
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:41,073
Glamour.

432
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:46,245
Brody? Brody,
what are you doing with Grandpa's lights?

433
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:47,537
Oh, my--

434
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,041
Ida.

435
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,336
- Ida, get the ladder.
- Oh, my goodness. Oh, Mr. Steven.

436
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:56,421
- Okay, okay, I'm coming. Okay.
- Come on.

437
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:57,589
Oh, my God.

438
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:02,386
- Uh-oh.
- You hang on there.

439
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:04,805
- Maybe he won't think it was me.
- Hurry.

440
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:07,891
Cindy.

441
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,269
What do you have there?

442
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:14,314
I found it in a box
with our Christmas decorations.

443
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,233
That was my mom's favorite ornament.

444
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,905
Thank you, Auntie Lou.
You're the best auntie ever.

445
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:23,282
Mm.

446
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:31,748
Coming through.

447
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,667
Oh, oh, oh!

448
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,297
Surprise.

449
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:41,508
I love gingerbread.

450
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,357
- How's that look?
- It's beautiful.

451
00:21:58,442 --> 00:21:59,276
We did good.

452
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,571
- You did amazing.
- It's so beautiful.

453
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:11,747
Hey.

454
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:13,623
Did you steal my sandwich?

455
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:14,708
Look, it's gone.

456
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,460
Just buy a new sandwich.

457
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,462
Oh, yeah. Sure, Mr. Moneybags.

458
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,088
On a garbageman's salary?

459
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:25,260
Well, aren't you two a sorry sight?

460
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:28,180
I told you
to never show your mug here again.

461
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:30,599
I'll wreck you like a squeaky toy.

462
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:34,394
No, no.

463
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:35,312
No. Kano.

464
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,189
Yes, yes, yes, Bark.

465
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:39,316
Beat it. We've got paying jobs.

466
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:43,862
Honest, smelly, lousy, paying jobs.

467
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,280
Hola, Roland.

468
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:47,032
Good to see you again, compadre.

469
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:48,241
My money's on Kano.

470
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:50,243
I'd put 3-to-1 on Bark.

471
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,496
He is very tricky, no?

472
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:53,455
Kano.

473
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,416
I've got a new plan, and it's foolproof.

474
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:57,793
Oh!

475
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,878
Score.

476
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,715
You say that every time.

477
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,094
And guess what.
Every time, it doesn't work.

478
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,554
Just hear me out.

479
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:10,472
Wanna try?

480
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,266
Kano, what's bigger than Pup Star?

481
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,726
Oh. I know, I know.

482
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:16,770
Mr. Rogers.

483
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:19,064
Idiot. Christmas.

484
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:22,651
People have to buy presents,
no matter what.

485
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,820
No, not in Mexico.

486
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:27,864
Santa brings gifts
for the poor niños and pups.

487
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:31,034
Only if they've been good all year,
of course.

488
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:32,577
Not anymore, he doesn't.

489
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,579
We are gonna run the North Pole.

490
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:36,623
You wanna take over Christmas?

491
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,500
That's quite the score.

492
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:41,044
Enough loot for every kid on earth.

493
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:42,712
All right, I'm in.

494
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:44,172
Me, too.

495
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:45,340
On one condition.

496
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,467
I get to fly the reindeer.

497
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:50,095
Yes, you can fly the reindeer.

498
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:51,346
Yes.

499
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:53,140
Yes. Yes.

500
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:55,851
Ah. Finally.

501
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:59,563
Muy bien, everyone's in,
los cuatro amigos.

502
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:02,524
- Yeah.
- Now may we please go somewhere warm?

503
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,901
Because Julio is not built for the cold.

504
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:06,194
Do you wanna tell him?

505
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,113
He'll figure it out soon enough.

506
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:30,969
Good to see you.

507
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,221
Good to see you.

508
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:42,022
How do we get to the North Pole?

509
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:46,026
Thank you.

510
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:49,654
Good to see you.

511
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,955
Okay. We'll need some disguises.

512
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:05,462
Watch your step. It's slippery out there.

513
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:06,630
With the snow.

514
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:13,428
Hey, did somebody leave a giant bag
of candy canes back here?

515
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:14,846
- What?
- Yeah.

516
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:15,847
Let me get some.

517
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,265
- Let's get them all.
- Yeah.

518
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:18,850
- Yeah.
- All right.

519
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:21,645
- Hey, where's the candy cane?
- You can't do that.

520
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:24,022
- I can't eat that.
- Hey. That belongs to me.

521
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:31,905
And that's
where a sugar addiction will get you.

522
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:33,531
It's sad, really.

523
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:39,412
Oh. Heh.

524
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:42,123
All aboard to Santa's workshop.

525
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:44,793
Oh. Mama, that's good.

526
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,587
Zip it. We've got a ride to catch.

527
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:02,018
Sorry, gang,
you gotta take the next coach.

528
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:03,061
Only one seat left.

529
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,354
I got this.

530
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,151
- Get out.
- Oh!

531
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,112
That's not a very holly-jolly attitude.

532
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,489
- You're on the naughty list.
- You're not very nice.

533
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:17,784
- No Christmas spirit in there.
- Look, two seats just opened up.

534
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,744
What luck.

535
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:22,914
- Julio...
- Is he okay?

536
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,082
Julio-cicle?

537
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,960
Oh, yeah. He's just not used to the cold.

538
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:29,963
- Right?
- Freezing.

539
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:41,266
There we go. Lock it up.

540
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:45,854
Hyah! Next stop, Santa's workshop.

541
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:50,066
Excuse me. Camera coming through.

542
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:53,445
Shep. What--? What are you doing?

543
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:55,613
Oh, this old thing? Heh.

544
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:57,824
Standing in for Santa, like an understudy.

545
00:26:58,491 --> 00:27:01,161
- Mr. Steven, out of my way.
- Reindeer, coming through.

546
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:03,371
- That's right. Come on.
- Only in the way, sir?

547
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,040
- Let's go.
- Watch yourself, sir.

548
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:05,957
Nutcrackers.

549
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:13,423
Finally, a venue big enough
to showcase my talents.

550
00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:15,550
And your ever-expanding head.

551
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:17,635
Hey, there's my pups.

552
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:20,263
You guys ready to run your big entrance?

553
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:23,266
Was that a serious question?

554
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,101
I was born ready.

555
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:29,022
Great. We're running the top and the tail,
so, watch for your cue.

556
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,069
Hyah, hyah, hyah!

557
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:39,324
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

558
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:45,789
Welcome to the North Pole.

559
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:48,208
- There you go.
- Thank you.

560
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:53,505
- Watch your step.
- Thank you.

561
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:55,006
All right.

562
00:27:55,340 --> 00:28:00,887
So, we are past quota
on mega blocks, whirly tubes...

563
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:01,888
Good, good.

564
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:03,556
Yo-yos?

565
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:04,682
Yo-yos.

566
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:07,102
Moon shoes and wiffle bats.

567
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,146
And for some unknown reason...

568
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:13,400
candy cane pattern fidget spinners.

569
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:19,989
Guys, this is serious business.
Get back to work.

570
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,032
Jackpot.

571
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:24,786
This'll be easier than taking biscuits
from a puppy.

572
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:27,747
I'm coming.

573
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:29,707
Something funny?

574
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:33,962
You guys act like you've never been
to the North Pole before.

575
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,299
Oh, yeah, it's, uh, been a while.

576
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,218
Been on sabbatical.

577
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:43,138
I see we're still using ribbons.

578
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:44,305
That's nice.

579
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:45,682
Uh-huh.

580
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:48,435
Yeah, well, we're South Pole elves.

581
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:49,352
This is Goofy,

582
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:52,397
Sleepy, Grumpy,

583
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,648
and I'm Bashful.

584
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:58,278
Those are dwarf names.

585
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:00,029
Elf names start with E.

586
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,824
I'm Eli. This is Eddy.

587
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,284
He's Elon.

588
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:05,201
Get the picture?

589
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:07,746
Well, Nosey with a capital E,

590
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:10,248
we're the Big Man's
new undercover security team.

591
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:13,084
And you don't wanna get
on our naughty list, do you?

592
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,549
Oh.

593
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,259
Julio? Are you okay?

594
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:24,846
Guys,
wrapping paper doesn't grow on trees.

595
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:32,896
Uh, tell me, my good elves,
where might we find Santa?

596
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:35,231
My guess,
since it's the middle of the work day,

597
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:37,859
he's taking a Yuletide nap in his cottage.

598
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:40,278
Thank you.

599
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:41,738
Excuse me.

600
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:45,784
All right, Tiny.

601
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:49,287
Here we are in the North Pole,
doing our first Christmas special.

602
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,371
I'm so excited.

603
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:53,208
Christmas is my favorite time of the year.

604
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:55,251
Oh, no, no, Gnarly, please.

605
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:57,712
Let me pull the sleigh all by myself.

606
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:00,173
Try pulling in a straight line, mon.

607
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:02,008
You been hitting the catnip again.

608
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:05,178
Go visit a barber,
I'm as straight as an arrow.

609
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:07,555
Cut, cut. Take five, everybody.

610
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:11,100
Hey, Simon,
where's that Christmas spirit, dog?

611
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:14,813
And suddenly,
the antlers aren't enough anymore.

612
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:18,399
I shall be celebrating Christmas
in my trailer.

613
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,322
That's beautiful. It's beautiful.

614
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:25,782
Okay, okay, okay.

615
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:26,950
I got this.

616
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:30,537
I have a plan, the perfect plan.

617
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,831
Actually, I can't wait to hear this.

618
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:36,167
I can have a plan, Kano.

619
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:38,086
Oh, do tell.

620
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:41,589
I'll surprise him
by going down the chimney, Santa-style.

621
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:43,049
He'll never see it coming.

622
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:46,261
How original.

623
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:47,595
Thank you.

624
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:50,098
And I bet I can just fly up there.

625
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:51,891
Check it out.

626
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:56,187
Here you go.

627
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:07,156
Is it weird I want him to succeed
and fall down the chimney into the fire?

628
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:16,374
- Oh, great. He'll brag about this forever.
- Top of the world.

629
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:18,626
That's right. That's right.

630
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:21,045
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here--

631
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:22,422
Whoa!

632
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:28,428
Dumb is forever.

633
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,362
How about we try the front door?

634
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:48,072
That's a good plan.

635
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,545
What is the meaning of this?

636
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:06,174
Sorry, big guy,
but there's a new Santa in town.

637
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:08,343
Me.

638
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,886
You've been downsized.

639
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:20,730
- Back it up.
- Remember, pups, you're up right after me.

640
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:23,107
We won't let you down, Mr. Shep.

641
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:27,654
Obviously, saving the best for last,
per usual.

642
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:32,075
I wonder what sweet swag
Santa's bringing us this year.

643
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:34,953
I don't know. It's a big surprise.

644
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:38,081
But where's Santa?

645
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:39,874
That's my cue.

646
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:41,668
Wait.

647
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,961
Is that my cue?

648
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:46,005
I-- No sé, I'm busy.

649
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:48,758
Yo, Santa. Where you at?

650
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:51,260
- Put it down.
- That light right now.

651
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:52,261
Dramatic entrance.

652
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:54,305
I sure hope Santa shows up.

653
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:55,848
Sometime soon?

654
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,433
Today, maybe?

655
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,185
Here's Santa.

656
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:01,229
Five, six, seven, eight.

657
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:05,984
Moving downstage.
And you sing. You dance. It's awesome.

658
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:09,195
Pas de bourrée, booty quake, booty quake.

659
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:12,490
Dab, whip, dab, and jazz hands.

660
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:14,534
Glad you could join us, SC.

661
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:17,662
Oh, uh... Ho ho ho. Heh.

662
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:19,622
It took a little while, Tiny,

663
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:22,458
but I think
I found you the perfect present.

664
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:24,836
Wait, Santa, do you mean...?

665
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:27,547
Are you for reals, Santa?

666
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:33,011
You guys are getting
the best Christmas present of all time.

667
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:36,347
Well, uh...

668
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:38,808
definitely a big surprise.

669
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:41,978
Ugh.

670
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:45,523
How can one show have so many words
and zero ninjas?

671
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:50,278
These costumes are embarrassing.
Not even designer knockoffs.

672
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:54,699
I mean, come on, people.
No elf princesses?

673
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:57,535
Uh...

674
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:00,455
"Say hello to your Christmas surprise."

675
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:03,041
Cut. Reset.

676
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:05,126
Tenth time's the charm.

677
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:12,133
Ugh, someone told me a fib.

678
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,676
This is not Miami.

679
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,428
I am certain of that now.

680
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:16,596
No, really?

681
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,139
We must've made a wrong turn.

682
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:19,974
So sorry, short stack.

683
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:25,271
Nice duds, huh?

684
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:29,108
Now I can give myself
that electric train you never brought me.

685
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:34,572
Am I growing a beard?

686
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:40,244
It takes more than a belly full of cookies
to wear that suit.

687
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:44,624
You can't be in the naughty list,
for starters.

688
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:48,795
Oh. Well, then let's rewrite history
a little, shall we?

689
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:54,300
Hmm.

690
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:56,052
Ah. Here we are.

691
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:09,565
Stupid Christmas.

692
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:12,485
All right, what's the scam this time?

693
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:15,947
Ha-ha. The scam, ahem...

694
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:19,951
or the plan, as I like to call it,

695
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:22,870
is that we are-- We're, uh...

696
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:26,082
What exactly is the plan again?

697
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:29,794
I'm appealing to the most powerful emotion
of human- and dogkind.

698
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:31,420
Love and kindness.

699
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:34,215
Greed.

700
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:36,676
- Simple commerce, really.
- Oh.

701
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:41,514
You're sadly underestimating the goodness
of the human heart.

702
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:42,849
Am I?

703
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,643
Everyone wants their kids and pups
to wake up

704
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:49,897
to toys, or gifts, or cookies,
or whatever, on Christmas morning.

705
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:53,484
Well, now they're gonna buy it
from the greatest brand of all time:

706
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:55,319
Santa Claus.

707
00:35:57,655 --> 00:36:01,492
Then we go to Miami,
and thaw out on the beach with chiquitas.

708
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:04,745
Christmas spirit doesn't
come in packages, Bark.

709
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:09,458
You can't sell people good times
with the people they love.

710
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:13,337
Any of this ringing a bell?

711
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:15,214
Hmm. No.

712
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:18,050
Surely you have people you love,
don't you?

713
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:20,469
Oh, get with the times, old man.

714
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,347
Humans and dogs are insatiable.
They'll buy anything.

715
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,976
If they don't,
we put coal in their stockings.

716
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,686
The ultimate punishment.

717
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:33,149
That's no bueno.

718
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:36,736
Here's your mail.

719
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:46,871
Come on, get up. We got mail.

720
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:49,999
Did Santa write us back,
about our list of demands?

721
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:53,169
Uh... Nothing but catalogs and bills.

722
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:56,422
Maybe we didn't make the nice list.

723
00:36:56,505 --> 00:37:00,343
No way. I mean, sure,
we've got a few minor infractions,

724
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:01,761
but we've served our time.

725
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,137
Right? Right?

726
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:06,724
I got it. Santa's the surprise guest star
of the show, right?

727
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:09,435
Whoa, whoa, whoa, say what?

728
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:12,271
Dad said I was the guest star.

729
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:13,272
Keep going, sis.

730
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:16,025
The diva needs some time
to process the obvious.

731
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:17,568
We sneak into Santa's sleigh,

732
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:20,321
fly to the North Pole,
and demand the loot we deserve.

733
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:23,199
In and out.
Back in time for Christmas. Easy-peasy.

734
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:26,327
All in favor, say "aye." Aye.

735
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:27,370
- Aye.
- Aye.

736
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:29,413
- Nay.
- That's unanimous.

737
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:33,334
I'm pretty sure that's
not what "unanimous" means.

738
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:37,505
Ebob, I need you to go around
and collect all these fidget spinners.

739
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:41,133
Uh...

740
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,594
What's going on here?

741
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:46,097
There's a merry-go-round?

742
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:50,017
Poor Santa and Mrs. Claus have come down
with a very bad flu.

743
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:53,020
- Oh. I better check on them right away--
- That's not possible.

744
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,732
He's under quarantine.
It's very contagious.

745
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:58,943
Especially to elves.

746
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:02,488
That's why we're here
to pick up the slack.

747
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:05,616
- Yeah.
- Yes. And he wants to make sure

748
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:09,704
the elves are able
to fulfill their orders for Navidad.

749
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,580
Orders? You mean wishes?

750
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:13,958
Orders, wishes, whatever.

751
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:17,253
Listen, Roland will be filling in
for Santa in the meantime.

752
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:20,464
Yes, and I will need full access
to Santa's lists,

753
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:21,966
cookie supply,

754
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,302
and, of course, the reindeer and sleigh.

755
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,847
This is highly unusual.

756
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:29,515
Why is the room spinning?

757
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:35,062
As you can see, this is an official order
from the Big Man himself. Mm-hm.

758
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:38,149
"By the order of Santa...
Christmas authority...

759
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:40,943
Bark hereby officially..."

760
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:43,821
Go ahead, take a real close look.

761
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:44,864
Uh...

762
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:46,741
Heh. Looks legit.

763
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:48,826
Okay. Uh, everyone...

764
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,037
This is the boss.

765
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,831
Ho ho ho, everyone.

766
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:57,251
Prepare the sleigh.

767
00:38:57,335 --> 00:39:00,796
I have very important events
to attend to tonight. So...

768
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,550
I see Santa's underpants.

769
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:12,308
Cover your eyes.

770
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,269
Chop-chop.

771
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:17,188
Okay.

772
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:25,029
Auntie Lou, can I ask you something?

773
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:28,324
You could talk to me about anything.
That's what aunties are for.

774
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:31,410
Let's just pretend I have this friend

775
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:35,539
that desperately wants
to go for a joyride in Santa's sleigh.

776
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:39,126
And you're worried that this friend
might get you on the naughty list?

777
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:41,754
- Maybe.
- Okay, girls.

778
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:44,256
- You can chitchat later. It's time to go.
- Okay.

779
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:48,427
- Volume.
- Yeah, so...

780
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:51,931
Look at our little pros.

781
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,517
We're not rushing them into this, right?

782
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,103
No, they know they can talk to us
about anything.

783
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:58,437
We're cool parents.

784
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:01,774
Look alive, pups. This is the real deal.

785
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:04,568
I need to know that I can trust you
to behave tonight.

786
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:08,697
Uncle Shep, we would never do anything
to make your job harder.

787
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:11,242
Besides, it's my debut.

788
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:13,869
You say "bark," we say "how loud?"

789
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:16,664
Thanks for being such a stellar dogfather.
Heh.

790
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:18,874
- Oh...
- Don't patronize me

791
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:21,085
- with your highty-tighty slang.
- Calm down.

792
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:24,171
By the smell of you, I'd say,
they put the antlers on the wrong end.

793
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:26,465
That's it. You're a prima donna, mon.

794
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:28,968
I challenge you to a joust.
You blabbermouth.

795
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:30,678
I am so gonna mop you up,

796
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:33,722
- just like the mop-head you are.
- Whoa. Whoa, okay?

797
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:35,683
Show me your moves, you ragamuffin.

798
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:37,101
Be forewarned.

799
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,562
I was varsity fencing at Dartmouth.

800
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:40,479
Shep.

801
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:43,441
Okay. Sit, stay, don't move a muscle.

802
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:45,192
Shep to the rescue.

803
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,028
Okay, eyes off target.

804
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:51,907
You know the plan. Santa's sweet ride
will be on the roof waiting for us.

805
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:55,661
Time to ditch the Shep dog.

806
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:57,538
No, I object.

807
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:59,457
Whoa, harsh, Cindy.

808
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:02,001
All in favor of ignoring Cindy?

809
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:03,294
Aye.

810
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:05,588
Sorry, Cindy, majority rules.

811
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:15,764
Somebody tell me
they have eyes on the pups.

812
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:17,892
Nobody?

813
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:20,895
Charlie. Rosie. Brody. Cindy.

814
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:27,776
Where did you get that suit?

815
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:31,280
Turns out the little guys are great
with a needle and thread.

816
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:33,824
Who would've thunk it? You likey?

817
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:36,744
Yeah.

818
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:40,456
Time to get down to business. Ahem.

819
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:53,093
Elon, this sleigh is filthy.
Please, clean it.

820
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:56,555
Thank you.

821
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,437
Prancer, light on those hooves.

822
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:06,023
I'm Prancer, and he's Dancer.

823
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:08,484
Oh. Right. I knew that.

824
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:10,736
Uh...

825
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:12,947
What's the difference again?

826
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,408
Very smooth.

827
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:18,536
Yeah, I don't do that.

828
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:22,915
New Santa is quite the hipster.

829
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:24,375
Timber.

830
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:27,419
Looking foxy, Vixen.

831
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:30,923
Are you...?

832
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:33,676
Are you playing reindeer games with me,
Cupid?

833
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:37,304
No, I just have resting loving eyes.

834
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,516
Oh, yeah. Cupid.

835
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,476
That makes sense.

836
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:48,148
Could someone bring Santa a strudel?

837
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:49,984
You look too skinny.

838
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:51,819
Nice pecs, Blitzen.

839
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,905
You're doing most
of the heavy lifting around here?

840
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:56,907
Danke, I work out.

841
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:59,702
And I take it you're the pilot, flyboy?

842
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:02,079
It's Comet, Santa.

843
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:05,666
That is enough insubordination
out of you, fella.

844
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,752
I am Santa, and what I say goes.

845
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:11,839
I have a friend
who knows this reindeer named Rudy,

846
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:13,924
and he would be happy to take your job.

847
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:16,760
So, think about that.

848
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,472
What a jabroni.

849
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:26,895
What was that?
I couldn't quite hear you, son.

850
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:29,982
Uh, I said, I like pepperoni, sir.

851
00:43:30,816 --> 00:43:31,650
So do I.

852
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:33,652
So do I.

853
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:40,618
Thank you.

854
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:48,834
Okay, just hold the reins loosely,
and the reindeer will do the rest.

855
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:52,838
I think I can handle it.
I flew a helicopter once.

856
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:55,424
Sort of.

857
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:57,384
Jiminy Christmas.

858
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,514
Oh, no, you didn't just slap my heinie.

859
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:03,849
Giddyap.

860
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:06,352
Ho ho ho!

861
00:44:09,938 --> 00:44:13,192
- See? I'm a natural.
- What do you want, a trophy?

862
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:16,820
- Hope you are not a nervous flyer.
- Let's give him a shock.

863
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:24,995
And I got a need...

864
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:25,996
for speed.

865
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:29,625
Here comes the sonic boom, ja?

866
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:36,507
Merry Christmas,
boys and girls, pups and pupettes,

867
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:39,593
and welcome
to the Pup Star Christmas Special.

868
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:42,846
- Oh. I love Christmas specials.
- Tonight we have...

869
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:47,893
I used to watch them with mi familia,
when I was bien chico.

870
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:49,520
We remember.

871
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:51,897
You were on the nice list back then.

872
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:54,942
So kind and caring.

873
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:57,403
Ah... Things change.

874
00:44:58,779 --> 00:44:59,613
It's starting.

875
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:00,989
All right, Tiny.

876
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:04,326
Here we are at the North Pole,
doing our first Christmas special.

877
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:05,411
I'm so excited.

878
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:08,372
Christmas is my favorite time of the year.

879
00:45:14,753 --> 00:45:16,922
Here we go, guys. Coming in for a landing.

880
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:30,352
Nice flying, ace. You're a natural.

881
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:37,568
Everyone, duck for cover. He's going
to spill his cookies.

882
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:41,738
Spin counterclockwise. It always helps me.

883
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:43,866
Whoa!

884
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:49,496
You know, venison is a delicacy
where I come from.

885
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:52,541
Thanks for the ride, fellas.

886
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:54,209
We'll be right back.

887
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:57,254
You guys just sit here and uh...

888
00:45:58,338 --> 00:45:59,173
spin.

889
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:05,512
There you go. After you.

890
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:08,891
Okay.

891
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:13,061
They've gotta be here somewhere.
Keep looking.

892
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:14,897
Oh! Mr. Claus.

893
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:18,817
It is such an honor
to have you on our show.

894
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,278
All right already.

895
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:23,155
No need to slobber.

896
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,658
Well, let's get this show on the road.

897
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:30,370
Santa's a very busy man this time of year,
as I'm sure you understand.

898
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:32,873
Yes. Yes, of course. Right this way.

899
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:36,668
You.

900
00:46:36,793 --> 00:46:38,504
Get lost.

901
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:44,843
I've got some last-minute changes
for Santa's number.

902
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:48,764
Five more minutes.

903
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:51,266
Step, step, turn-step, jazz-hooves.

904
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:54,811
This better be worth it.

905
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:57,856
This is my debut we're missing, remember?

906
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:58,774
Relax, sis.

907
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:02,736
With all the loot we're gonna get,
you can buy your way into showbiz.

908
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:05,906
Vixen, you are cray-cray like a fox.

909
00:47:08,116 --> 00:47:11,370
So many dancing sugarplums.

910
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:13,956
For the record, this is a bad--

911
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:16,458
I mean, worst idea ever.

912
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:19,795
Get wise, Cindy.
We're only here to meet Santa.

913
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:26,468
Guess who. Tag.

914
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:38,105
Man, look at us.
Meeting Santa for some carols?

915
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:39,982
Hope he's got a solid track,
locked and loaded.

916
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:44,278
Trust me, this one's a showstopper.

917
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:47,489

00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:34,054
This way.

951
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:41,311
Wait. This... is a bit of a surprise, no?

952
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:45,565
Yes. A shocking and appalling surprise.

953
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:48,235
Whee!

954
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:50,696
You're on fire.

955
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:52,739
I know.

956
00:49:52,989 --> 00:49:55,909
The audience loved me.
They really loved me.

957
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:58,245
No, you're literally on fire.

958
00:49:58,370 --> 00:49:59,246
Huh?

959
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:01,373
What--? What you--?

960
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:11,174
Move it, bozo. We don't wanna be here
when the canine cops show up.

961
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:20,726
Ow!

962
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:23,520
Mush.

963
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:27,649
We have liftoff, pups.

964
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:36,158
- I'm sorry, Tiny.
- Did you find them?

965
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:37,701
They've disappeared.

966
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:40,996
They're not in Costumes,
not in the green room, not anywhere.

967
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:43,623
- Nothing?
- Yo, no stone unturned.

968
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:46,501
Don't worry, I promise, we will find them.

969
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:48,962
We're horrible parents.

970
00:50:49,254 --> 00:50:51,089
I'll never forgive myself.

971
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:57,888
Whoa, aurora borealis.

972
00:50:57,971 --> 00:51:00,599

973
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:04,060

974
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:06,104
In you go, in you go. Yeah.

975
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:14,279
So long, old Christmas.

976
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:18,867
This is the season for giving to us.

977
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:21,369
I can finally buy that luxury eye patch.

978
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:23,830

1048
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:00,839
This is outrageous.

1049
00:55:01,047 --> 00:55:04,300
I mean, what's even the point
of being a good pup all year?

1050
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:07,554

1051
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:10,306

1053
00:55:13,309 --> 00:55:14,310
You're not Santa.

1054
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:17,313

of the North Pole.

1055
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:19,649
What, you mean like a mascot?

1056
00:55:19,941 --> 00:55:22,444
And the last horse
crosses the finish line.

1057
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:24,320
Okay, you stay here.

1058
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:26,823

00:55:38,376 --> 00:55:39,377
Time is money.

1061
00:55:40,211 --> 00:55:42,047
Candy doesn't grow on trees.

1062
00:55:44,215 --> 00:55:45,050
Or does it?

1063
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:47,802
Eli, look into that.

1064
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:52,640
Here's our chance.

1065
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:56,394
Santa's alone, we go in,
state our case for more loot--

1066
00:55:56,478 --> 00:55:57,437
And fame.

1067
00:55:57,562 --> 00:56:00,398
Then I drive the sleigh home, as agreed.

1068
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:02,358
Come on.

1069
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:04,152
Something isn't right.

1070
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:07,322
Santa isn't this mean
and selfish in the book.

1071
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:11,910
Seriously, sis,
you can't believe everything you read.

1072
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:14,162
Think of it like a movie.

1073
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:15,789
Based on a true story,

1074
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:18,750
but with embellishments
to make it more interesting.

1075
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:23,671
Like Santa not being crazy, and sweaty,
and a total sugar junkie.

1076
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:26,800
- All in favor, say "aye."
- Aye.

1077
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:29,469
Nay, nope, nada.

1078
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:31,679
Democracy. It just works.

1079
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:35,475
Mr. Claus, sir.

1080
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:39,896
We're here to negotiate the terms
of our Christmas demands.

1081
00:56:40,688 --> 00:56:42,107
How'd you guys get in here?

1082
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:43,691
We stowed away in your sleigh.

1083
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:45,985
Sweet ride, by the way. Totally cherry.

1084
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:49,072
And the "stowed away" thing
shouldn't count against us,

1085
00:56:49,197 --> 00:56:52,826
since you stole my limelight at the show.

1086
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:58,081
Let me apologize in advance
for my brother and sisters.

1087
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:02,836
They're a little confused
about the true meaning of Christmas.

1088
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:05,255
But they have good hearts, honest.

1089
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:10,093
Uh... Santa's having a little bit
of a senior moment, kids.

1090
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:12,345
Who exactly are you?

1091
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:14,597
I'm Brody. You can call me Bro.

1092
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:15,723
I'm Charlie.

1093
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:18,476
Rosie, obviously.

1094
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:20,854
And I'm Cindy, Mr. Santa, sir.

1095
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:25,191
Not to name drop,
but our mom is Tiny, and our pop is P.U.P.

1096
00:57:26,025 --> 00:57:27,485
Ding-dong? Ring a bell?

1097
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:29,112
Kind of a big deal.

1098
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:34,576
Oh, well, I'm sure we can
work something out.

1099
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:36,327
Whoa, yeah.

1100
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:39,664
Did I miss the punch line?

1101
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:41,082
Ho ho ho.

1102
00:57:42,917 --> 00:57:46,379
Cindy was trying to tell us
that the puppies were up to something big.

1103
00:57:47,088 --> 00:57:51,217
And how is being on the roof going
to help us find the puppies?

1104
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:52,135
Don't you see?

1105
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:56,014
Santa, he landed his sleigh here,
right before the puppies disappeared.

1106
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:58,892
Lou, you're a genius.

1107
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:02,061
Everybody, scour the roof for clues.

1108
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:12,197
Tastes like toothpaste.

1109
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,658
I think that's North Pole reindeer poop.

1110
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:19,454
It looks like Cindy left us a clue.

1111
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:22,957
The puppies are in the North Pole.

1112
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:26,252
Let's go.

1113
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:29,881
Let's go.

1114
00:58:31,549 --> 00:58:33,718
A Tony for humble Julio?

1115
00:58:33,801 --> 00:58:35,053
Of course.

1116
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:38,765
The king of Broadway, you say?

1117
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:44,354
At this rate,
there won't be enough Christmas spirit

1118
00:58:44,437 --> 00:58:45,939
to power a piece of tinsel.

1119
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:47,607
We have to do something.

1120
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:53,446
Honey, we're home.

1121
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:57,033
Wake up, short stack.

1122
00:58:57,116 --> 00:58:59,327
- What was that?
- You're supposed to stand guard.

1123
00:59:00,745 --> 00:59:03,665
I mean... I was, Kano.

1124
00:59:03,748 --> 00:59:09,837
It was a tricky trick I played,
to see if they try to escape, heh, heh.

1125
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:12,423
Never going to happen on Julio's watch.

1126
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:17,345
Not that you asked, but we're on track
for the most profitable Christmas yet.

1127
00:59:18,012 --> 00:59:19,847
I've got that workshop humming.

1128
00:59:20,306 --> 00:59:24,060
What you're doing, Bark,
is destroying the spirit of Christmas.

1129
00:59:24,769 --> 00:59:27,188
Oh, look at the Christmas naughty list.

1130
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:29,190
It's out of control.

1131
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:32,318
The only ledger I care about
is my accounts ledger,

1132
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:33,987
and it's also growing.

1133
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:35,905
Profits are skyrocketing.

1134
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:38,783
Ka-ching, ka-ching.

1135
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:39,951
Hey.

1136
00:59:40,785 --> 00:59:42,579
Look what I found.

1137
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:46,332
I told you, no mascots in Santa's cottage.

1138
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:48,376
Executive staff only.

1139
00:59:48,459 --> 00:59:51,504
Excuse me? Who are you calling a mascot?

1140
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:52,422
Oh, okay.

1141
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:56,843
Well, I guess I'll just send Tiny
and P.U.P.'s adorable little pups

1142
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:58,386
- back home.
- What the...?

1143
00:59:58,803 --> 01:00:00,597
You did-- But-- How did...?

1144
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:01,764
Roland.

1145
01:00:06,519 --> 01:00:09,772
Anyone else find it odd
there's two Santas?

1146
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,317
Ho-ho-ho-ho!

1147
01:00:17,488 --> 01:00:19,532
- Who are those guys?
- She looks familiar.

1148
01:00:21,242 --> 01:00:22,535
Tickets, please.

1149
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:23,995
Tickets, please.

1150
01:00:24,954 --> 01:00:26,831
Why is everyone staring at us?

1151
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:31,544
Maybe it's because you're dressed up
as Mrs. Claus.

1152
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:32,879
- Elvin.
- Incognito.

1153
01:00:33,379 --> 01:00:34,339
- Tickets.
- There.

1154
01:00:35,256 --> 01:00:37,592
- I want to look good for Santa.
- How you doing?

1155
01:00:37,675 --> 01:00:40,345
This was the only costume
in the wardrobe that fit me.

1156
01:00:41,429 --> 01:00:42,347
How have you been?

1157
01:00:42,722 --> 01:00:44,307
Shh! He's coming.

1158
01:00:44,849 --> 01:00:46,351
Act normal.

1159
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:50,396
Hello. Tickets, please.

1160
01:00:52,231 --> 01:00:54,192
Oh.

1161
01:00:54,275 --> 01:00:55,902
It was just here.

1162
01:00:56,027 --> 01:01:00,573
Um, I must have left it
in my other pointy hat.

1163
01:01:03,576 --> 01:01:05,453
Do you know who I think I am?

1164
01:01:08,539 --> 01:01:09,707
Mrs. Claus.

1165
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:12,418
Latina sister?

1166
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:19,592
I will make sure there's
a little extra something for you

1167
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:21,135
in your stocking this year.

1168
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:23,262
Being an elf is a calling.

1169
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:26,474
We work for the love of Christmas,
not for money.

1170
01:01:27,308 --> 01:01:28,768
And I'm pretty sure

1171
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:30,853
Mrs. Claus doesn't have a Latina sister.

1172
01:01:31,979 --> 01:01:35,566
Of course I'm her sister.

1173
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:37,819
Trust me. I think I'd know.

1174
01:01:40,863 --> 01:01:43,449
You can put our tickets
on the North Pole account.

1175
01:01:43,574 --> 01:01:44,784
Mm-hm.

1176
01:01:45,284 --> 01:01:46,786
Okay. You can go now.

1177
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:47,704
Bye-bye.

1178
01:01:48,871 --> 01:01:49,914
Tickets, please.

1179
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:51,958
Tickets.

1180
01:02:00,591 --> 01:02:01,801
Mrs. Claus?

1181
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:04,554
Did that turkey infraction put us
on the naughty list?

1182
01:02:05,179 --> 01:02:09,851
No, dear. You're good puppies
that occasionally make mistakes.

1183
01:02:09,934 --> 01:02:11,310
It's part of growing up.

1184
01:02:11,936 --> 01:02:14,063
Good,
because we have some serious demands.

1185
01:02:14,355 --> 01:02:15,606
I mean, requests.

1186
01:02:15,815 --> 01:02:17,567
Assuming we escape, of course.

1187
01:02:18,025 --> 01:02:20,570
I'm so glad you're the real Santa, Santa.

1188
01:02:21,863 --> 01:02:23,489
I was starting to lose faith.

1189
01:02:39,505 --> 01:02:41,215
Thanks for riding. Keep it moving.

1190
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:42,550
Keep it moving.

1191
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,136
Come on. Thanks for riding.

1192
01:02:46,387 --> 01:02:47,221
Have a good one.

1193
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:49,682
Thank you for riding.

1194
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:51,476
Señorita Claus.

1195
01:02:52,143 --> 01:02:53,311
Ooh!

1196
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:57,565
Excuse me,
where's the bus to the North Pole?

1197
01:02:57,648 --> 01:03:01,778
The coach is where it always is,
and has been forever and a day.

1198
01:03:02,111 --> 01:03:02,945
Right this way.

1199
01:03:05,823 --> 01:03:07,033
- This way?
- That way.

1200
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:07,992
Thank you.

1201
01:03:08,075 --> 01:03:08,910
Have a good one.

1202
01:03:09,535 --> 01:03:11,162
Adiós, Ms. Claus.

1203
01:03:13,414 --> 01:03:14,248
Good to see you.

1204
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:18,586
And that's everyone.

1205
01:03:19,045 --> 01:03:20,296
We're the only ones left.

1206
01:03:20,421 --> 01:03:21,297
Huh.

1207
01:03:27,011 --> 01:03:28,471
So, let me get this straight.

1208
01:03:29,388 --> 01:03:30,932
You filed an MPR...

1209
01:03:32,683 --> 01:03:33,768
a Missing Persons Report...

1210
01:03:36,103 --> 01:03:38,397
- for four of your lost puppies.
- That's right.

1211
01:03:38,856 --> 01:03:44,612
And now your daughter,
their show manager, and the puppies' nanny

1212
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:46,656
have suddenly gone missing.

1213
01:03:46,739 --> 01:03:48,950
Officer, it's kind of an emergency.

1214
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:51,160
I'll get right on that.

1215
01:03:51,744 --> 01:03:53,412
Ooh, it's the glazed...

1216
01:03:56,249 --> 01:03:57,917
Thank you for your time, officer.

1217
01:04:00,753 --> 01:04:03,089
There has to be a logical explanation.

1218
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:06,175
If I know Lou,
she's already hot on their trail.

1219
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:07,802
I hope.

1220
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:11,931
Well, thank goodness Ida is with them,
wherever that is.

1221
01:04:12,014 --> 01:04:12,849
Yeah, Tiny.

1222
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:14,350
Nobody messes with Ida.

1223
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:17,520
Finally.

1224
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:22,441
Bark?

1225
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:24,735
Hello from the North Pole.

1226
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:25,653
Go figure.

1227
01:04:26,112 --> 01:04:27,780
This has your stench all over it.

1228
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:29,031
I should've known.

1229
01:04:29,365 --> 01:04:31,701
Who else is crazy enough
to ruin Christmas?

1230
01:04:32,159 --> 01:04:34,996
Look at it as a reboot, Christmas 2.0.

1231
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:38,374
But I didn't call to bicker about that.
I've already won.

1232
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:40,793
I'm calling because I have your pups.

1233
01:04:41,502 --> 01:04:42,587
I knew you took them.

1234
01:04:42,795 --> 01:04:45,172
Learn a new trick already,
you dirty dognapper.

1235
01:04:45,256 --> 01:04:46,257
Au contraire.

1236
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:48,092
That's the beauty of it.

1237
01:04:48,467 --> 01:04:51,762
Seems some extra furry baggage snuck
into Santa's sleigh.

1238
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:53,139
You're lying.

1239
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:54,557
Our pups would never--

1240
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:55,474
Am I?

1241
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:59,228
Your pups came here,
because they wanted more, more, more.

1242
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:00,938
Smart pups.

1243
01:05:01,647 --> 01:05:02,773
Except little Cindy,

1244
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:06,193
who can't tell the difference
between fairy tales and reality.

1245
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:09,196
Just when I thought you couldn't
sink any lower.

1246
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:12,283
Skip the pleasantries.
Name your price already.

1247
01:05:12,783 --> 01:05:14,368
Oh, you'll love this.

1248
01:05:14,619 --> 01:05:17,079
I want you
to put on your Christmas special again

1249
01:05:17,371 --> 01:05:18,247
on Christmas Eve.

1250
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:20,917
Why? So you can ruin it again?

1251
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:24,670
So you can thank
your new official sponsor, me.

1252
01:05:25,087 --> 01:05:27,465
Kano will send you the script.
Do my show right,

1253
01:05:27,548 --> 01:05:29,967
your little trespassers
will be returned safely.

1254
01:05:30,051 --> 01:05:31,177
Don't, and...

1255
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:32,887
Well, c'est la vie.

1256
01:05:33,387 --> 01:05:34,639
So, deal?

1257
01:05:35,014 --> 01:05:37,141
Of course it is. I have your puppies.

1258
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,185
Happy Christmas.

1259
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:44,565
I don't think we have another choice here.

1260
01:05:44,649 --> 01:05:45,816
We have to do the show.

1261
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:50,655
Here we go.

1262
01:05:50,738 --> 01:05:54,033
Hyah, hyah, hyah! Whoa!

1263
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:55,868
Whoa, whoa!

1264
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:03,793
Welcome to the North Pole.

1265
01:06:04,710 --> 01:06:08,589
- This is it. Sneaky-sneaky. Okay.
- Come on. Okay, this way.

1266
01:06:08,673 --> 01:06:09,840
Of course there is.

1267
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:11,384
- There it is.
- Is that it?

1268
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:26,774
Hey.

1269
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:30,444
Oh, no. Oh, no. Shep.

1270
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:33,990
You three.

1271
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:37,576
Does he mean us?

1272
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:39,453
Oh, for the love of Christmas.

1273
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:41,706
Yes, you three.

1274
01:06:42,206 --> 01:06:43,332
Get over here, pronto.

1275
01:06:43,416 --> 01:06:45,126
- Who?
- I guess he does mean us.

1276
01:06:50,131 --> 01:06:50,965
Who are you?

1277
01:06:51,799 --> 01:06:54,510
We are your new elf recruits, sir.

1278
01:06:54,635 --> 01:06:55,886
Uh-huh.

1279
01:06:56,512 --> 01:06:57,722
And who are you supposed to be?

1280
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:00,725
Mrs. Claus' long-lost Latina twin sister.

1281
01:07:01,142 --> 01:07:02,393
Señora Claus.

1282
01:07:03,394 --> 01:07:04,353
It's true.

1283
01:07:04,854 --> 01:07:08,065
Well, since we're being honest,
let me tell you a secret.

1284
01:07:08,149 --> 01:07:09,859
Oh, I love secrets. Okay.

1285
01:07:13,612 --> 01:07:14,447
Plastic.

1286
01:07:15,322 --> 01:07:16,991
Okay, fess up.

1287
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:20,453
Look.
We're just trying to find our puppies.

1288
01:07:20,911 --> 01:07:22,747
We think that Roland dognapped them.

1289
01:07:23,414 --> 01:07:26,250
Yes. And take down that evil,
maniacal dog, Bark.

1290
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:27,752
What's your plan?

1291
01:07:30,629 --> 01:07:31,881
We actually have no plan.

1292
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:34,008
Yeah.

1293
01:07:34,091 --> 01:07:38,179
We didn't think we'd get this far,
so, we're kind of winging it.

1294
01:07:38,763 --> 01:07:41,766
- Okay. You want your pups back...
- Uh-huh.

1295
01:07:42,183 --> 01:07:44,226
- and I want my workshop back.
- Uh-huh.

1296
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:45,895
So, let's go and get Santa.

1297
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:47,563
- Okay. Yes. Okay.
- Yes.

1298
01:07:48,314 --> 01:07:49,899
We're gonna go meet Santa.

1299
01:07:49,982 --> 01:07:50,900
Hey.

1300
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:53,903
It's this way.

1301
01:07:55,654 --> 01:07:56,489
Yes. Okay.

1302
01:07:56,989 --> 01:07:58,365
- Yes, this way.
- Santa.

1303
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:02,369
I think it was the 1970s, right here.

1304
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:07,166
You're stress-eating, gordo.

1305
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:10,628
If you don't like the way I eat,
you don't have to watch.

1306
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:14,131
You know sugar is more addictive
than caffeine?

1307
01:08:14,882 --> 01:08:16,092
You need discipline.

1308
01:08:16,175 --> 01:08:18,260
I'm Santa. It's normal.

1309
01:08:19,178 --> 01:08:22,556
Hey, so, do you guys know
if we're still getting gifts or...?

1310
01:08:23,891 --> 01:08:28,187
Answer: Sometimes even good kids
don't get what they want.

1311
01:08:28,854 --> 01:08:29,688
Happy?

1312
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:32,942
We have bigger problems, hombre.

1313
01:08:33,317 --> 01:08:35,069
Enough. Enough already.

1314
01:08:35,611 --> 01:08:39,323
Enough with the list of demands,
and the scams,

1315
01:08:39,573 --> 01:08:42,034
and the endless need for attention.

1316
01:08:42,493 --> 01:08:45,079
Whoa, sis. Let's not get crazy here.

1317
01:08:45,246 --> 01:08:47,206
Some of us were born to be the star.

1318
01:08:47,289 --> 01:08:49,458
And let's not throw out all the fun, okay?

1319
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:54,672
Just because you're smarter, bigger,
and more talented doesn't make you right.

1320
01:08:55,172 --> 01:08:58,384
Brody, it's time you took responsibility

1321
01:08:58,467 --> 01:09:02,054
for all the chaos you've caused,
in the name of fun.

1322
01:09:02,555 --> 01:09:04,974
I feel like the stupidest,
funnest brother ever.

1323
01:09:05,307 --> 01:09:07,059
Rosie, newsflash.

1324
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:08,769
It's not always about you.

1325
01:09:08,853 --> 01:09:13,065
Cut to:
Rosie, feeling like a terrible sister.

1326
01:09:13,524 --> 01:09:16,527
Charlie, things don't make you happy.
Period.

1327
01:09:16,861 --> 01:09:19,697
I love you guys.
Even more than all of my stuff.

1328
01:09:21,949 --> 01:09:24,368
You want some crackers with that cheese?

1329
01:09:24,451 --> 01:09:25,703
Get real, pups.

1330
01:09:26,495 --> 01:09:27,872
Look here.

1331
01:09:28,247 --> 01:09:29,790
You're right. There it is.

1332
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:33,127
You know, Roland,
when you were a little boy,

1333
01:09:33,210 --> 01:09:35,045
you were on our nice list.

1334
01:09:35,629 --> 01:09:36,881
In fact, our records show

1335
01:09:36,964 --> 01:09:39,758
you got that train
you so kindly asked for.

1336
01:09:41,385 --> 01:09:42,428
No, I didn't.

1337
01:09:43,137 --> 01:09:45,598
You put coal in my stocking every year.

1338
01:09:46,515 --> 01:09:49,560
Roland, come take a look at our records.

1339
01:10:15,169 --> 01:10:18,923
Here you go, Roland,
that train set that you always wanted.

1340
01:10:20,090 --> 01:10:21,634
No, that's not true.

1341
01:10:22,218 --> 01:10:23,802
Oh...

1342
01:10:36,315 --> 01:10:37,900
Guys. Santa came.

1343
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:38,984
Yeah. Yeah.

1344
01:10:39,944 --> 01:10:41,570
- What'd you get?
- Coal.

1345
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:43,656
I tried my hardest to be good.

1346
01:10:44,448 --> 01:10:46,325
I'm giving up on Christmas.

1347
01:11:05,052 --> 01:11:08,847
I'm so sorry that happened to you,
Mr. Roland.

1348
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:11,725
I don't care. It was a long time ago.

1349
01:11:13,477 --> 01:11:16,313
You don't want
all those good little boys and girls

1350
01:11:16,397 --> 01:11:18,357
to get coal in their stockings,

1351
01:11:18,732 --> 01:11:21,735
just because their families can't
afford gifts, do you?

1352
01:11:24,738 --> 01:11:26,407
No, no, no. Don't listen, Roland.

1353
01:11:26,991 --> 01:11:27,825
He lies.

1354
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:29,493
Sweet, sweet lies.

1355
01:11:29,618 --> 01:11:30,536
Oh...

1356
01:11:30,911 --> 01:11:31,996
Julio.

1357
01:11:32,871 --> 01:11:36,959
You were the happiest pup in the junkyard,
before you lost your family.

1358
01:11:38,502 --> 01:11:41,422
You stopped believing in Christmas
that day.

1359
01:11:45,259 --> 01:11:47,886
Nobody tells Julio how Julio feels.

1360
01:11:57,354 --> 01:11:58,314
Oh, no.

1361
01:11:58,939 --> 01:12:01,400
The waterworks.

1362
01:12:05,696 --> 01:12:09,867
These are sweet, sweet truths.

1363
01:12:10,951 --> 01:12:12,786
We have a captive clientele,

1364
01:12:13,412 --> 01:12:16,707
elves that work for candy,
and zero competition.

1365
01:12:17,791 --> 01:12:19,626
It's time to raise prices.

1366
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:20,669
Genius.

1367
01:12:20,878 --> 01:12:23,130
All we have to do now is deliver
on Christmas,

1368
01:12:23,213 --> 01:12:25,549
and charge those parents' credit cards
into the ground.

1369
01:12:25,632 --> 01:12:27,801
We're rich. Tiny's ruined.

1370
01:12:28,469 --> 01:12:30,220
This must be what happy feels like.

1371
01:12:31,305 --> 01:12:32,139
Okay.

1372
01:12:35,225 --> 01:12:36,769
Oh, okay. Okay.

1373
01:12:41,148 --> 01:12:44,860
Okay, here's the plan. Shep,
you're gonna bust down the front door.

1374
01:12:45,235 --> 01:12:47,363
I'm not exactly the rough-and-tumble type.

1375
01:12:47,446 --> 01:12:49,031
I got this.

1376
01:12:56,121 --> 01:12:56,955
Oh!

1377
01:12:57,039 --> 01:12:59,375
Oh, impressive.

1378
01:12:59,458 --> 01:13:01,335
Coming. I got it. I got it.

1379
01:13:01,418 --> 01:13:03,796
All right. Elon,
you'll come down the chimney.

1380
01:13:03,879 --> 01:13:05,297
I always wanted to do that.

1381
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:07,383
- Good. Lou, you keep a watch out.
- Okay.

1382
01:13:07,466 --> 01:13:10,135
All right, here's the thing.
I'm gonna go around back.

1383
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:12,346
As soon as you hear the moose mating call,

1384
01:13:12,429 --> 01:13:14,223
- we go in.
- Okay.

1385
01:13:14,306 --> 01:13:16,433
- You'll know it when you hear it.
- Mm-hm.

1386
01:13:16,725 --> 01:13:17,559
Okay, go.

1387
01:13:20,187 --> 01:13:21,021
Here we go.

1388
01:13:21,313 --> 01:13:24,900
- Here we go.
- Quiet. We go sneaky-sneaky, okay?

1389
01:13:29,655 --> 01:13:30,489
Ready, boss.

1390
01:13:32,908 --> 01:13:35,452
Bark and Kano only care about themselves.

1391
01:13:36,203 --> 01:13:38,163
Their souls are as black as coal.

1392
01:13:38,372 --> 01:13:41,583
Yes, but you both have love
in your hearts,

1393
01:13:42,167 --> 01:13:45,754
which went dormant,
when you were hurt as little boys.

1394
01:13:46,922 --> 01:13:47,756
This...

1395
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:50,426
This is why you're Santa Claus.

1396
01:13:50,968 --> 01:13:53,846
Now we can get Christmas back on track.

1397
01:13:59,685 --> 01:14:00,519
What was that?

1398
01:14:01,019 --> 01:14:02,271
Christmas chupacabra?

1399
01:14:02,354 --> 01:14:04,356
It's not moose mating season.

1400
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:18,537
Elf uprising.

1401
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:19,663
Everybody, flee.

1402
01:14:20,497 --> 01:14:21,540
Wha--?

1403
01:14:23,709 --> 01:14:24,835
Hey, quit it.

1404
01:14:25,210 --> 01:14:26,628
Eli, what's going on here?

1405
01:14:27,379 --> 01:14:29,840
- We're here to save you, boss.
- Whoa!

1406
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:35,095
Props to you, SC.
It's harder than it looks.

1407
01:14:37,014 --> 01:14:39,683
Good news, Eli. We're already saved.

1408
01:14:39,766 --> 01:14:43,395
These nice pups and handsome Chihuahua...

1409
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:46,273
And formerly misguided man-child.

1410
01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:49,359
They've seen the error in their ways.

1411
01:14:53,530 --> 01:14:54,364
They're coming.

1412
01:15:05,417 --> 01:15:06,460
Shh.

1413
01:15:09,087 --> 01:15:10,714
Why am I not surprised?

1414
01:15:11,089 --> 01:15:13,884
Just once, I'd like things to go smoothly.

1415
01:15:18,805 --> 01:15:20,933
They're going. They're going.

1416
01:15:22,851 --> 01:15:24,353
A gift? For me?

1417
01:15:26,647 --> 01:15:28,148
Obviously I deserve it, but...

1418
01:15:28,232 --> 01:15:30,692
what do you get
for the dog who owns the world?

1419
01:15:33,111 --> 01:15:34,696
Uh-oh!

1420
01:15:38,450 --> 01:15:39,618
What the...?

1421
01:15:40,494 --> 01:15:42,663
Um, who are you?

1422
01:15:42,746 --> 01:15:44,122
I'm the puppies' nanny.

1423
01:15:44,414 --> 01:15:47,501
And I'm their manager,
slash publicist, slash dogfather.

1424
01:15:47,751 --> 01:15:49,378
And I'm their Auntie Lou.

1425
01:15:49,461 --> 01:15:51,922
I knew you'd come, Aunt Lou.

1426
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:53,924
That's what aunties are for.

1427
01:15:54,258 --> 01:15:56,260
Do something, you half-wits.

1428
01:15:56,343 --> 01:16:00,681
Sticks and stones may break my bones,
but your names bounce off of Julio.

1429
01:16:01,056 --> 01:16:04,601
We hereby officially resign
from the Mean Team.

1430
01:16:04,893 --> 01:16:06,478
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

1431
01:16:06,812 --> 01:16:09,898
Roland, don't do this.
Think about the good times. Like...

1432
01:16:13,068 --> 01:16:16,071
Bark, you are a perro muy malo.

1433
01:16:16,488 --> 01:16:18,865
Time we take back the North Pole,

1434
01:16:19,366 --> 01:16:23,161
and show the world
the true meaning of Christmas.

1435
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:25,956
Later, dog breath.

1436
01:16:26,039 --> 01:16:29,543
Say, you guys wouldn't
mind us rerouting all your swag

1437
01:16:29,626 --> 01:16:32,004
to good kids and puppies in need,
would you?

1438
01:16:32,504 --> 01:16:34,006
Take a picture of them, Elon.

1439
01:16:36,925 --> 01:16:38,385
You'll be insta-losers.

1440
01:16:38,510 --> 01:16:40,804
You won't be able to buy a follower.

1441
01:16:47,853 --> 01:16:50,022
And if I were you, I'd stay in that jail.

1442
01:16:50,897 --> 01:16:53,859
There's a lot of angry elves out there
with low blood sugar.

1443
01:16:57,571 --> 01:16:58,905
Foolproof, you said.

1444
01:16:58,989 --> 01:17:00,407
So, who's the fool?

1445
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:07,706
I just put the suit on,
and I'm sweating like crazy.

1446
01:17:07,789 --> 01:17:09,458
Are you sure this is necessary?

1447
01:17:09,541 --> 01:17:12,628
I'm more of a "behind the scenes"
kind of guy, you know?

1448
01:17:13,045 --> 01:17:15,130
- Are we really doing this, T?
- Yes.

1449
01:17:15,255 --> 01:17:16,715
And in spite of Bark,

1450
01:17:16,798 --> 01:17:20,010
we are going
to put on the best Christmas show ever.

1451
01:17:20,093 --> 01:17:21,970
People need their spirits lifted,

1452
01:17:22,054 --> 01:17:23,680
and we need to show Bark

1453
01:17:23,764 --> 01:17:26,266
that he can't put a price tag
on Christmas spirit.

1454
01:17:29,269 --> 01:17:30,312
Let's do this.

1455
01:17:31,813 --> 01:17:35,651
Ladies and gents, pups and puppettes,
on this Christmas Eve,

1456
01:17:37,027 --> 01:17:41,490
the Santa Claus Corporation is proud
to bring you

1457
01:17:41,573 --> 01:17:43,367
the Pup Star Christmas Special.

1458
01:17:43,825 --> 01:17:48,121
Tiny, P.U.P., and we hope their puppies,
will bring Christmas cheer to one and all

1459
01:17:48,413 --> 01:17:50,332
at no extra cost.

1460
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:55,796

I'll be back in a North Pole minute.

1486
01:19:36,396 --> 01:19:39,691
I'm sorry there's no room for you four
in the sleigh.

1487
01:19:40,192 --> 01:19:41,777
Oh, don't sweat it, Santa.

1488
01:19:41,902 --> 01:19:43,779
We'll hold down the North Pole
till you get back.

1489
01:19:44,404 --> 01:19:46,114
Ooh!

1490
01:19:48,283 --> 01:19:51,119
And now it's time to fly good tidings

1491
01:19:51,203 --> 01:19:53,997
to all the good little pups and kids
all over the world.

1492
01:19:55,499 --> 01:19:58,043
Let's spread some Christmas cheer.

1493
01:19:59,669 --> 01:20:05,300
But, Brody, I sure could use a copilot
to help me fly this sleigh.

1494
01:20:05,383 --> 01:20:06,426
It's all happening.

1495
01:20:06,718 --> 01:20:08,053
My vision board came true.

1496
01:20:08,386 --> 01:20:10,013
I will not let you down, Santa.

1497
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:12,682
We'll be tracking your progress, sir.

1498
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:16,436
It's good to have you back.

1499
01:20:18,563 --> 01:20:21,608
Glad to be flying
with the good guys again, SC.

1500
01:20:22,359 --> 01:20:23,902
Let's get a move on, now.

1501
01:20:23,985 --> 01:20:25,821
I'm ready to move and groove.

1502
01:20:26,196 --> 01:20:28,281
We've got a Christmas to save.

1503
01:20:29,282 --> 01:20:34,371
On Dancer, on Prancer, on Cupid, on Vixen,

1504
01:20:34,663 --> 01:20:37,165
on Comet, on Blitzen.

1505
01:20:37,833 --> 01:20:39,793
- Bye, Santa.
- Bye.

1506
01:20:39,876 --> 01:20:41,461
Merry Christmas, Santa.

1507
01:20:43,630 --> 01:20:45,298
Come on. Oh, yeah.

1508
01:20:55,392 --> 01:20:58,812
I gotta say,
this Christmas kind of went off the rails.

1509
01:20:59,521 --> 01:21:03,275
I just really hope Santa brought our wish.

1510
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:04,734
Am I...?

1511
01:21:05,193 --> 01:21:06,027
Is this...?

1512
01:21:06,736 --> 01:21:08,864
Can somebody please tell me
what my cue is?

1513
01:21:10,198 --> 01:21:12,117
Actually, I think that's my cue.

1514
01:21:12,534 --> 01:21:13,660
Santa.

1515
01:21:13,743 --> 01:21:15,662
Ho, ho, ho.

1516
01:21:16,913 --> 01:21:18,081
- Dad.
- Lou.

1517
01:21:19,583 --> 01:21:20,417
Merry Christmas.

1518
01:21:21,042 --> 01:21:22,502
I'm so sorry that we're late.

1519
01:21:22,586 --> 01:21:25,797
Hey, it's not Christmas
unless we have the whole family together.

1520
01:21:26,381 --> 01:21:27,841
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

1521
01:21:28,967 --> 01:21:30,552

but I think we can make an exception.

1533
01:22:30,946 --> 01:22:32,989
It would be an honor, Santa.

1534
01:22:35,075 --> 01:22:36,034
Mom, Dad.

1535
01:22:38,161 --> 01:22:39,871
It's a Christmas miracle.

1536
01:22:40,497 --> 01:22:42,666
Santa, you found our pups.

1537
01:22:45,085 --> 01:22:46,670
You're welcome, world.

1538
01:22:46,753 --> 01:22:47,837
I found Santa.

1539
01:22:48,254 --> 01:22:49,130
Rosie.

1540
01:22:49,214 --> 01:22:50,674
Okay, okay.

1541
01:22:50,924 --> 01:22:52,550
We found Santa.

1542
01:22:52,926 --> 01:22:55,178
It was so crazy. I drove the sleigh.

1543
01:22:55,261 --> 01:22:57,597
And Santa said
I could come back every year.

1544
01:22:57,681 --> 01:23:00,600
Oh, you'll have to excuse me, friends,

1545
01:23:01,142 --> 01:23:03,770
but I'm a wee bit behind schedule
this year.

1546
01:23:04,646 --> 01:23:07,649
So, a Merry Christmas to all,

1547
01:23:08,984 --> 01:23:12,237
and to all, a good night.

1548
01:23:12,404 --> 01:23:13,697

Hi.

1575
01:24:49,542 --> 01:24:53,129
And Santa has a train just like this
at the North Pole,

1576
01:24:53,213 --> 01:24:55,215
and the elves run it.

1577
01:24:56,091 --> 01:24:57,801
