Get rid of her. It's not the likes of
her that we want. Drive her out of here.

The Priest himself should
be told to send her away.

Father, send her away.
We don't like her here.

I'm aware of this attraction
she has for our opposite sex.

But she's highly strung and emotional.

00:16:51,092 --> 00:16:53,403
Don't you worry about their money.
I'm worried about mine.

179
00:16:53,996 --> 00:16:55,988
The Chocolate Kid won't
be fit to fight for days.

180
00:16:56,135 --> 00:16:57,794
Thrashing the life out of him like that.

181
00:16:57,941 --> 00:16:59,220
Listen, Joe.
- Shut up.

182
00:16:59,367 --> 00:17:02,003
You're not punishing my lad so that
you can show off to a bit of a girl.

183
00:17:02,307 --> 00:17:03,408
Who, me?
- Yes, you.

184
00:17:03,576 --> 00:17:06,372
I don't want no boxing Casanova
in my outfit. Remember that.

185
00:17:07,042 --> 00:17:09,752
Where do you think you're off to now?
- I'll be back in half an hour.

186
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:12,740
Going out for a breath of air.
- So that's what you call it, is it?

187
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:15,297
Well, see you are back in time.
Because if you are late ..

188
00:17:15,542 --> 00:17:17,501
She can have those beautiful
big muscles of yours.

189
00:17:17,915 --> 00:17:19,073
And have them for good.

190
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:36,788
Happy?

191
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:39,583
I've never been so happy.

192
00:18:40,331 --> 00:18:41,375
Not in all my life.

193
00:18:43,993 --> 00:18:44,636
Good.

194
00:18:57,201 --> 00:18:57,844
Well?

195
00:18:58,218 --> 00:19:00,045
Could you have done
better with anyone else?

196
00:19:00,866 --> 00:19:02,063
Go on, say it.

197
00:19:02,659 --> 00:19:03,903
Aren't you glad it was me?

198
00:19:04,859 --> 00:19:05,975
Yes Dan, I am.

199
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:09,967
Why not let me ..

200
00:19:13,262 --> 00:19:14,113
You?

201
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,763
Better than wasting them
on Betty Grable here.

202
00:19:18,227 --> 00:19:19,782
Well, what's wrong with me?

203
00:19:21,397 --> 00:19:22,956
There is nothing wrong with you, Dan.

204
00:19:24,017 --> 00:19:25,118
Only I don't want to.

205
00:19:25,482 --> 00:19:26,640
You like me, don't you?

206
00:19:27,303 --> 00:19:28,272
Dan, let's go.

207
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:29,424
Sit down.

208
00:19:29,924 --> 00:19:31,666
What's all this innocent stuff for, eh?

209
00:19:32,694 --> 00:19:34,103
You don't need it with me.

210
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:36,445
Now look at me, my girl.

211
00:19:37,422 --> 00:19:38,234
Come on.

212
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:42,695
Pretending you've never been out under
the moon with one of the village lads.

213
00:19:44,929 --> 00:19:45,687
You know.

214
00:19:46,065 --> 00:19:47,595
There is something about you, Emily.

215
00:19:49,013 --> 00:19:50,698
I don't know what it is, but it kinda ..

216
00:19:51,239 --> 00:19:52,478
It kinda gets me.

217
00:19:53,408 --> 00:19:55,016
Yes. Honest, Emily. I mean it.

218
00:19:56,206 --> 00:19:58,688
Yes, I know. That's what
they say to all the girls.

219
00:19:59,596 --> 00:20:01,248
But sure as I'm here it is true.

220
00:20:02,957 --> 00:20:05,389
Yes, you've got something alright.

221
00:20:11,453 --> 00:20:12,110
Emmy.

222
00:20:12,429 --> 00:20:13,174
Emmy!

223
00:20:22,714 --> 00:20:24,802
Hey lads, here's a bit of fun.
Emmy Beaudine.

224
00:20:30,143 --> 00:20:31,861
Let me go. Let me go.

225
00:20:33,157 --> 00:20:34,360
Let me go!

226
00:20:58,924 --> 00:20:59,685
Emmy.

227
00:21:02,924 --> 00:21:04,002
Is something wrong?

228
00:21:05,638 --> 00:21:06,509
No, Father.

229
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:07,822
It's nothing.

230
00:21:09,542 --> 00:21:11,162
It was dark and I ran.

231
00:21:11,533 --> 00:21:12,974
You've been to the fair.

232
00:21:14,349 --> 00:21:16,842
Ah well. I suppose the fair is the fair.

233
00:21:18,814 --> 00:21:19,772
Come, my child.

234
00:21:20,983 --> 00:21:22,372
I must talk to you.

235
00:21:40,635 --> 00:21:41,810
Come in, child.

236
00:21:48,177 --> 00:21:49,120
Sit down.

237
00:21:57,638 --> 00:21:58,384
Emmy.

238
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,765
There is something I have to say to you.

239
00:22:06,243 --> 00:22:09,038
Something I haven't found it
easy to bring myself to do but ..

240
00:22:09,881 --> 00:22:11,414
I can no longer avoid it.

241
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:13,266
Emmy.

242
00:22:13,825 --> 00:22:15,487
You've been a good servant to me.

243
00:22:16,482 --> 00:22:17,944
I am going to miss you very much.

244
00:22:19,437 --> 00:22:20,166
Miss me?

245
00:22:20,656 --> 00:22:21,644
Yes, child.

246
00:22:23,381 --> 00:22:24,539
For you are going away.

247
00:22:26,648 --> 00:22:27,806
But I don't want to go.

248
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:29,584
Emmy.

249
00:22:30,648 --> 00:22:32,936
Try not to make it
harder for both of us.

250
00:22:33,813 --> 00:22:35,077
Try to understand.

251
00:22:36,404 --> 00:22:39,921
For months now your life in this
place has been clouded with hate.

252
00:22:40,282 --> 00:22:43,061
The women, you know, they see
something in you that they fear.

253
00:22:43,343 --> 00:22:44,129
Something.

254
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:47,098
Unusual and strange that ..

255
00:22:49,418 --> 00:22:51,304
Perhaps only women understand.

256
00:22:52,212 --> 00:22:54,957
So, all this hatred,
all this persecution.

257
00:22:55,911 --> 00:22:56,863
It must end.

258
00:22:57,588 --> 00:22:59,071
I'm afraid, child. I must ..

259
00:22:59,552 --> 00:23:01,351
I must consider the peace of the parish.

260
00:23:02,237 --> 00:23:05,394
And while you are here it
seems there can be no peace.

261
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:15,112
But don't cry, child.

262
00:23:16,337 --> 00:23:17,152
Look, Emmy.

263
00:23:17,677 --> 00:23:20,164
I've written to some friends of
mine on a farm in England.

264
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:23,431
Good, kindly people there.
You'll be happy with them, I know.

265
00:23:23,718 --> 00:23:26,474
And you'll be as fine a servant
to them as you have been to me.

266
00:23:27,474 --> 00:23:28,929
But I don't want to go, Father.

267
00:23:30,572 --> 00:23:32,112
I don't know any other life.

268
00:23:33,554 --> 00:23:34,797
Father, I am all alone.

269
00:23:35,269 --> 00:23:36,656
And I have only you to help me.

270
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:38,386
Please, Father.

271
00:23:38,894 --> 00:23:40,422
Please tell me I can stay.

272
00:23:50,425 --> 00:23:51,461
It's the women.

273
00:23:52,721 --> 00:23:53,743
They hate me.

274
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:55,319
They always have.

275
00:24:02,681 --> 00:24:04,313
What have I done that's wrong?

276
00:24:05,722 --> 00:24:06,810
Can help it ..

277
00:24:07,356 --> 00:24:09,768
If wherever I go the
men's eyes follow me?

278
00:24:11,034 --> 00:24:12,275
If I go to the village.

279
00:24:14,171 --> 00:24:15,477
The farm boys stare at me.

280
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,284
Men in the pubs look over
their glasses and grin.

281
00:24:22,767 --> 00:24:24,749
There is no mystery in
every word they say.

282
00:24:26,222 --> 00:24:27,065
All of them.

283
00:24:28,434 --> 00:24:29,697
Staring and whispering.

284
00:24:31,925 --> 00:24:32,828
The women.

285
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,850
So dreadful to me.

286
00:24:38,274 --> 00:24:40,415
It is .. it's no fault of mine.

287
00:24:43,382 --> 00:24:44,133
Emmy.

288
00:24:56,803 --> 00:24:57,893
Alright, Father.

289
00:25:00,315 --> 00:25:01,405
I will go.

290
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,135
Here we are, Miss.

291
00:25:27,649 --> 00:25:29,923
Look, that's Larry Tallent.
He'll show you the way.

292
00:25:30,392 --> 00:25:31,064
Larry.

293
00:25:31,302 --> 00:25:32,787
A young lady for the farm.

294
00:25:33,434 --> 00:25:35,040
Come along. I'll take you up now.

295
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:37,098
Well, come on. They won't bite.

296
00:25:40,263 --> 00:25:41,044
Whee ..

297
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:42,907
Go on.

298
00:25:44,587 --> 00:25:45,902
Are you interested in sheep?

299
00:25:46,179 --> 00:25:47,375
Oh yes, I eat them.

300
00:25:47,597 --> 00:25:49,635
We specialise in them. We breed them.

301
00:25:51,043 --> 00:25:52,974
You are not from this part
of the world, are you?

302
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:54,655
No. I am from Ireland.

303
00:25:55,047 --> 00:25:56,457
Why then, you are the new girl.

304
00:25:56,747 --> 00:25:58,350
Here, come on. Give me your bag.

305
00:26:10,601 --> 00:26:11,845
Jacob, take them will you.

306
00:26:12,103 --> 00:26:13,747
We're going up to the house.
- Alright.

307
00:26:14,795 --> 00:26:15,638
There it is.

308
00:26:17,378 --> 00:26:18,279
Well, come on.

309
00:26:23,133 --> 00:26:24,697
They're all in a bit of a scramble.

310
00:26:24,844 --> 00:26:26,650
You know what it's like
when we're shearing.

311
00:26:26,797 --> 00:26:28,653
Come on, Major. Come on.
There's a good boy.

312
00:26:31,212 --> 00:26:33,114
Say, just look what Larry
has found for himself.

313
00:26:34,655 --> 00:26:36,732
One of them is a fast worker
and I bet it isn't her.

314
00:26:46,768 --> 00:26:48,396
It must be the new girl from Ireland.

315
00:26:48,615 --> 00:26:49,344
Come on.

316
00:26:50,823 --> 00:26:51,466
Bess.

317
00:26:51,957 --> 00:26:52,625
Bess.

318
00:26:55,862 --> 00:26:57,161
Bess, this is Emmy.

319
00:26:57,506 --> 00:26:58,561
Come in, won't you.

320
00:26:58,968 --> 00:27:00,413
We weren't expecting you so soon.

321
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,319
Father Cocoran didn't
say you'd come today.

322
00:27:02,466 --> 00:27:05,170
You're Emmy Beaudine, aren't you?
- Yes. How do you do?

323
00:27:05,479 --> 00:27:06,999
You must have had a tiring journey.

324
00:27:07,587 --> 00:27:09,421
I was a little bit sick on the ship.

325
00:27:09,754 --> 00:27:10,683
Oh. Poor thing.

326
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,633
You'd better sit down, hadn't you.

327
00:27:13,899 --> 00:27:15,394
Bess. Did I or did I not ..

328
00:27:17,882 --> 00:27:18,697
Who's this?

329
00:27:19,024 --> 00:27:21,817
It's the new girl dad. You know, the new
girl Father Cocoran wrote to us about.

330
00:27:22,505 --> 00:27:23,091
Oh.

331
00:27:23,632 --> 00:27:25,994
Well, make yourself at home.
You'll soon get to know us.

332
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:27,482
You.

333
00:27:27,785 --> 00:27:29,392
You came rather suddenly, didn't you?

334
00:27:29,835 --> 00:27:30,654
I mean.

335
00:27:30,961 --> 00:27:32,605
We didn't know you were coming, did we.

336
00:27:32,868 --> 00:27:34,539
Oh yes, it was all rather sudden.

337
00:27:35,094 --> 00:27:36,281
I'm like that, you know.

338
00:27:36,642 --> 00:27:37,995
Everyone in the village said:

339
00:27:38,142 --> 00:27:40,326
'No Emmy, you mustn't go.
You must stay here with us'.

340
00:27:41,465 --> 00:27:43,598
When I make up my mind
I never waste time.

341
00:27:46,361 --> 00:27:47,548
They liked me, you know.

342
00:27:50,086 --> 00:27:52,532
Perhaps you would like to hang your
coat in the kitchen, would you.

343
00:27:55,534 --> 00:27:58,190
'It was all rather sudden.
I'm like that you know'.

344
00:27:58,462 --> 00:27:59,478
When was she born?

345
00:27:59,625 --> 00:28:01,781
Not what we expected, is she.
- A luscious bit of goods.

346
00:28:10,409 --> 00:28:11,641
Well, if I can help ..

347
00:28:11,926 --> 00:28:13,547
No, I don't want you to start work yet.

348
00:28:13,777 --> 00:28:16,261
Perhaps you can wash your hands
and then I can show you round a bit?

349
00:28:16,514 --> 00:28:17,635
You are very kind.

350
00:28:19,317 --> 00:28:21,796
I say Bess, hurry up with the tea.
The men are parched.

351
00:28:22,673 --> 00:28:24,068
Emmy, you'd better meet Saul.

352
00:28:24,565 --> 00:28:26,667
Julie's young man. You'll be
seeing quite a lot of him.

353
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,575
How do you do?
- I knew I heard your beautiful voice.

354
00:28:29,722 --> 00:28:31,390
Nothing else to do but worry us here?

355
00:28:31,537 --> 00:28:34,151
Nothing else to do? Breaking our backs
out there and not one cup of tea.

356
00:28:34,298 --> 00:28:36,286
Well, don't bother us. We work here.
- Come off it.

357
00:28:36,665 --> 00:28:38,271
Give us a kiss.
- Mind my lipstick.

358
00:28:40,337 --> 00:28:42,062
Don't take any notice of them, Emmy.

359
00:28:42,787 --> 00:28:44,541
When you two have quite
finished spooning.

360
00:28:44,688 --> 00:28:46,126
That's alright. Passes the time.

361
00:28:46,435 --> 00:28:48,824
Take Emmy with you, will you?
I'd like her to find her way about.

362
00:28:48,971 --> 00:28:49,757
Of course.

363
00:28:49,996 --> 00:28:51,948
There you are, Emmy.
See what our farm is like.

364
00:28:52,095 --> 00:28:54,983
Tell me when you're ready for supper.
- Right. Can't be too soon for me.

365
00:28:55,337 --> 00:28:56,152
Come along.

366
00:28:57,943 --> 00:28:59,015
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

367
00:29:00,915 --> 00:29:03,018
She's a marvel, isn't she.
Wouldn't say boo to a goose.

368
00:29:03,165 --> 00:29:04,390
What do you think of her?

369
00:29:04,537 --> 00:29:06,054
The men will like her.
- I'll say.

370
00:29:06,587 --> 00:29:07,518
Why? Don't you?

371
00:29:07,736 --> 00:29:08,727
I don't know.

372
00:29:13,273 --> 00:29:15,331
You'll feel a bit strange
around here, won't you.

373
00:29:15,959 --> 00:29:18,260
Yes. I've never been
out of Ireland before.

374
00:29:19,405 --> 00:29:20,792
What did you say your name was?

375
00:29:21,053 --> 00:29:22,317
Saul?
- That's right.

376
00:29:23,334 --> 00:29:26,358
The bible says that Saul was a
choice young man and goodly.

377
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,052
Do you ever read it?

378
00:29:28,444 --> 00:29:29,499
Well, not often.

379
00:29:29,975 --> 00:29:31,248
Oh, it's very interesting.

380
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,496
If you know the right parts to read.

381
00:29:33,928 --> 00:29:35,214
Well. How about that.

382
00:29:55,763 --> 00:29:57,180
Bob. Tea is up.

383
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,601
A bit late, aren't you?

384
00:30:02,748 --> 00:30:04,523
Emmy, this is Bob. Bess's old man.

385
00:30:04,852 --> 00:30:06,138
Not so much of the 'old'.

386
00:30:06,645 --> 00:30:07,631
And this is Emmy.

387
00:30:07,809 --> 00:30:09,396
She's the new help.
- How do you do?

388
00:30:09,584 --> 00:30:11,028
I hope you'll be very happy here.

389
00:30:11,481 --> 00:30:14,070
Hang on a minute and have some tea.
And then you can take the cups back.

390
00:30:23,778 --> 00:30:26,756
Forty shearings I've seen
on this farm, man and boy.

391
00:30:26,961 --> 00:30:28,262
And I'll tell you something.

392
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:31,045
As sure as I'm here, every
shearing brings a wedding.

393
00:30:31,318 --> 00:30:33,444
And every wedding brings a christening.

394
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,076
You've done your share, Jacob.

395
00:30:40,307 --> 00:30:43,016
Well, who's the next blushing
bride for the ball and chain?

396
00:30:43,265 --> 00:30:45,077
Young Julie, eh?

397
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:48,010
That happy lad yonder is
going to have his hands full.

398
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,491
Don't you look at me Jacob
you old goat. What about you?

399
00:30:53,177 --> 00:30:55,847
Now Jacob, when are wedding
bells going to ring for thee?

400
00:30:57,507 --> 00:31:00,290
Not me. As my old dad used to say.

401
00:31:00,549 --> 00:31:04,913
It's a wise man that chases a woman
but only a fool catches up with her.

402
00:31:06,938 --> 00:31:07,867
Give us a tune.

403
00:31:08,858 --> 00:31:10,961
I'll give you a tune. Here you are.

404
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:15,694
Listen to them.
Best lads in the country.

405
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:17,294
Do you like it here, Emmy?

406
00:31:17,515 --> 00:31:18,457
Oh, Mr Tallent.

407
00:31:19,041 --> 00:31:21,910
This is like a home and
I've never had a home.

408
00:31:22,675 --> 00:31:24,951
And you are all such
good and solid people.

409
00:31:26,365 --> 00:31:28,096
I'm going to be very happy here.

410
00:31:44,475 --> 00:31:45,090
Hoy!

411
00:31:45,525 --> 00:31:47,536
Is the Tallent farm
somewhere around here?

412
00:31:48,563 --> 00:31:51,309
Down the road. Over that way.

413
00:31:51,579 --> 00:31:54,415
About two miles down.
Turn at the right fork.

414
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:59,065
Hey, I said down there.

415
00:32:00,166 --> 00:32:02,053
Don't worry. It will keep.

416
00:32:27,606 --> 00:32:29,963
Emmy is very quiet, isn't she.
- Why shouldn't she be?

417
00:32:30,954 --> 00:32:33,056
Just look in there and see
what she's doing will you.

418
00:32:33,289 --> 00:32:34,078
Oh, Bess.

419
00:32:45,278 --> 00:32:46,173
Yes, Julie?

420
00:32:47,212 --> 00:32:49,535
Oh nothing, Emmy. It's quite alright.

421
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:54,280
I do wish you wouldn't
make me spy on her.

422
00:32:54,562 --> 00:32:56,350
What was she doing?
- Polishing the silver.

423
00:32:56,806 --> 00:32:58,070
And enjoying it.

424
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:02,260
You don't like Emily, do you.
- Have I ever said that?

425
00:33:02,792 --> 00:33:03,864
You never needed to.

426
00:33:04,332 --> 00:33:05,433
Your eyes are enough.

427
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,449
Who's that beer for, Emmy?

428
00:33:16,114 --> 00:33:18,080
Why, Larry. In the stables.

429
00:33:18,715 --> 00:33:19,410
Oh.

430
00:33:20,011 --> 00:33:21,799
Will you tell him supper
will be ready soon.

431
00:33:23,485 --> 00:33:24,672
What are you smiling at?

432
00:33:27,611 --> 00:33:28,710
I don't know.

433
00:33:29,762 --> 00:33:31,254
Perhaps I just like to smile.

434
00:33:37,727 --> 00:33:39,424
Now, just what have you got against her?

435
00:33:41,098 --> 00:33:41,827
Nothing.

436
00:33:43,456 --> 00:33:44,385
Nothing at all.

437
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,283
Some beer, Larry?
- I can do with that. Thanks.

438
00:33:50,933 --> 00:33:53,286
Have some yourself.
- Sure, I never touch it.

439
00:33:53,557 --> 00:33:55,058
You don't know what you're missing.

440
00:33:56,162 --> 00:33:57,320
Supper is nearly ready.

441
00:33:58,355 --> 00:34:00,544
I'll be in to wash as soon as
I get the nags out to graze.

442
00:34:00,691 --> 00:34:01,563
Come on, Tom.

443
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,501
There's a good boy. Come on.

444
00:34:12,932 --> 00:34:13,862
Hello, Brian.

445
00:34:15,574 --> 00:34:17,082
Glad to see me, are you Brian?

446
00:34:17,428 --> 00:34:19,072
Come on, here. Look what I have for you.

447
00:34:22,279 --> 00:34:24,030
There. For your sweet Irish tooth.

448
00:34:32,277 --> 00:34:32,949
Hello.

449
00:34:34,076 --> 00:34:34,857
Hello.

450
00:34:36,952 --> 00:34:38,139
Are Bess and Julie home?

451
00:34:39,227 --> 00:34:40,527
Yes they are, surely.

452
00:34:42,678 --> 00:34:44,488
It's sweltering hot outside.

453
00:34:46,005 --> 00:34:47,020
What do you think?

454
00:34:47,702 --> 00:34:48,821
I wouldn't know.

455
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:51,287
Whatever you think, will do.

456
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:54,839
Now don't go.

457
00:34:58,195 --> 00:34:59,524
Is Larry about somewhere?

458
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:02,374
Strange you should ask me that.

459
00:35:03,377 --> 00:35:04,850
You must have passed him just now.

460
00:35:07,454 --> 00:35:09,359
So, you're not fooling me, you see.

461
00:35:10,628 --> 00:35:12,128
You are very young, aren't you.

462
00:35:13,436 --> 00:35:14,079
Am I?

463
00:35:16,808 --> 00:35:19,421
It's a great pleasure to have
you breathing down my neck.

464
00:35:21,092 --> 00:35:21,943
Like it?

465
00:35:22,804 --> 00:35:24,044
If it wasn't so draughty.

466
00:35:25,816 --> 00:35:27,716
It's thirsty work in
the fields, isn't it.

467
00:35:29,274 --> 00:35:30,423
Why do you ask?

468
00:35:31,226 --> 00:35:32,842
I just smell that you have quenched it.

469
00:35:35,852 --> 00:35:37,468
I never know when you are joking, Emmy.

470
00:35:38,904 --> 00:35:40,033
You are a funny thing.

471
00:35:41,059 --> 00:35:43,319
Indeed. How I must make myself laugh.

472
00:35:44,123 --> 00:35:45,971
Now, you mustn't stand so close to me.

473
00:35:46,707 --> 00:35:49,496
If someone were to come in it would be
a great pity to make a fool of yourself.

474
00:35:50,094 --> 00:35:51,413
You like me. Don't you?

475
00:35:52,136 --> 00:35:53,498
I haven't given it a thought.

476
00:35:54,689 --> 00:35:55,695
Emmy, there is ..

477
00:35:56,213 --> 00:35:57,743
There is something about you that ..

478
00:35:58,489 --> 00:35:59,277
That ..

479
00:35:59,623 --> 00:36:00,724
You know what I mean.

480
00:36:01,279 --> 00:36:02,863
Don't you? Don't you?

481
00:36:03,472 --> 00:36:04,883
Indeed, I hope I don't.

482
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,624
Now I feel it would be much better if ..

483
00:36:08,308 --> 00:36:10,591
Very quietly, you were
to tiptoe out and go.

484
00:36:10,771 --> 00:36:11,500
Stop it.

485
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:14,208
I don't know what the
devil has got hold of me.

486
00:36:15,115 --> 00:36:16,359
When I come near you, I ..

487
00:36:17,323 --> 00:36:18,653
I don't seem to be able to ..

488
00:36:19,306 --> 00:36:20,869
I never seem to hold myself.

489
00:36:21,348 --> 00:36:22,982
I can't. I can't.

490
00:36:25,032 --> 00:36:26,316
Why are you laughing at me?

491
00:36:31,869 --> 00:36:32,965
Let me look at you.

492
00:36:34,422 --> 00:36:35,729
Then don't joke with me.

493
00:36:38,072 --> 00:36:39,415
You have a very deep chest.

494
00:36:41,476 --> 00:36:43,255
You are stronger than I thought.

495
00:36:43,879 --> 00:36:45,576
No. No, you mustn't kiss me.

496
00:36:47,236 --> 00:36:47,859
You.

497
00:36:48,253 --> 00:36:49,043
Why, you.

498
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:50,463
Julie, shut up.
- Shut up?

499
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:52,707
I'll scratch your beastly face
you skirt-chasing cad.

500
00:36:52,854 --> 00:36:54,298
Let me alone.
- Julia, please.

501
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:56,314
Don't touch me.
- What is all this?

502
00:36:56,916 --> 00:36:59,460
This smirking ape can't be left alone
with a maid for half a minute.

503
00:36:59,607 --> 00:37:01,921
He goes like a bull at her.
You cheap little rotter.

504
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:04,667
I ought to pull my nails down your face.
- Julie, that will do.

505
00:37:04,927 --> 00:37:05,885
Emmy, come here.

506
00:37:06,083 --> 00:37:07,212
It's not Emmy's fault.

507
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:08,471
It's that man.

508
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:09,812
Julie.

509
00:37:10,191 --> 00:37:12,379
You've been making rather a
fool of yourself, haven't you?

510
00:37:13,424 --> 00:37:15,602
Bess, I don't know what came over me.

511
00:37:16,112 --> 00:37:17,327
No, I don't think you do.

512
00:37:17,646 --> 00:37:20,407
Haven't you seen a good-looking servant
before that makes you behave like a ..

513
00:37:20,598 --> 00:37:21,614
A clown with ours?

514
00:37:22,638 --> 00:37:23,310
Sorry.

515
00:37:23,611 --> 00:37:24,946
Now listen to me, you turnip.

516
00:37:25,398 --> 00:37:27,534
You contact a story Julie
can pretend to believe.

517
00:37:28,574 --> 00:37:29,560
I'll do the rest.

518
00:37:31,338 --> 00:37:32,464
Just a minute, Emmy.

519
00:37:32,682 --> 00:37:33,989
I haven't finished with you.

520
00:37:36,101 --> 00:37:38,146
You are by way of being
a bit of a flirt, aren't you?

521
00:37:38,508 --> 00:37:39,666
You shouldn't say that.

522
00:37:40,032 --> 00:37:41,047
Well, I do say it.

523
00:37:41,579 --> 00:37:42,937
And you needn't look so pious.

524
00:37:43,682 --> 00:37:45,441
Butter wouldn't melt in
your mouth, I know.

525
00:37:46,115 --> 00:37:48,062
Well, you don't bring
those habits to this farm.

526
00:37:48,278 --> 00:37:49,885
It's terrible the things you say.

527
00:37:51,357 --> 00:37:52,535
I'm not a bad girl.

528
00:37:53,817 --> 00:37:55,605
What made you leave
your village in Ireland?

529
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,175
Father Cocoran.
- I want to know why. Tell me.

530
00:37:58,555 --> 00:38:00,159
He wrote to you for me to come here.

531
00:38:00,415 --> 00:38:01,802
They didn't like you, did they?

532
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:03,302
They didn't, did they? Why?

533
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:04,255
Why?

534
00:38:06,084 --> 00:38:07,368
Leave me alone, can't you.

535
00:38:16,811 --> 00:38:17,787
Where's Larry?

536
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:20,268
How often must I tell that young
man to be on time for lunch?

537
00:38:20,415 --> 00:38:22,357
Come on, let's start without him.
I'm starving.

538
00:38:22,504 --> 00:38:23,392
Here he is.

539
00:38:23,539 --> 00:38:25,659
Trust him to arrive when
there's a smell of food about.

540
00:38:25,806 --> 00:38:27,932
Say, what do you know?
Murdoch's fair come to Matrick.

541
00:38:29,358 --> 00:38:30,500
Oh, I'm sorry.

542
00:38:30,815 --> 00:38:31,952
That's alright, Emmy.

543
00:38:32,692 --> 00:38:33,707
Feeling a bit off?

544
00:38:33,995 --> 00:38:35,484
Can't have Emmy going down on us.

545
00:38:35,737 --> 00:38:37,525
Well, have you been
slave-driving her, Bess?

546
00:38:37,712 --> 00:38:38,975
Oh Bob. As if I would.

547
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:41,659
You do look a bit pale, Emmy.

548
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:43,116
No, I am alright.

549
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,872
Really, I'm alright.

550
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:48,688
Now, Dad. Just you look at this.
'Murdoch's mammoth fair. Boxing ..'

551

Don't flap that thing in my face.

552
00:38:50,633 --> 00:38:51,819
Well, you might read it.

553

Come on Dad. Be your age.

554
00:38:53,795 --> 00:38:56,547
How about you and I hitting the high
spots tonight? Just the two of us.

555
00:38:56,994 --> 00:38:59,661
A couple of young lads on a spree.
- Let's all go. It might be rather fun.

556
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:02,235
I wouldn't even think of it.
Ha. I'm an Alderman.

557
00:39:02,382 --> 00:39:04,997
It wouldn't do for me to be seen
mixing up with gypsies and the like.

558
00:39:05,144 --> 00:39:07,298
I don't know. It may do you good.
What do you say, Bob?

559
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:08,187
Alright.

560
00:39:08,334 --> 00:39:10,694
Come on, dad. Stop being chairman
of the gas committee for once.

561
00:39:10,872 --> 00:39:13,019
I repeat, I will <i>not</i>.
- Good. That's settled.

562
00:39:13,259 --> 00:39:15,752
Then, we'll celebrate.
We'll take my new car.

563
00:39:19,344 --> 00:39:20,522
Good grief. It goes.

564
00:39:20,741 --> 00:39:24,152
Goes? What do you mean, goes?
Got it up to 30 on the flat.

565
00:39:25,094 --> 00:39:26,309
Where's your coat, Emmy?

566
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:29,327
My coat? I'm not coming.

567
00:39:29,474 --> 00:39:31,889
Of course you're coming.
A bit of excitement will do you good.

568
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,619
You've had some chickens in this.
- Don't be so fussy.

569
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:36,359
Fresh air will soon blow that away.

570
00:39:36,693 --> 00:39:39,140
I don't want to go to the fair.
Please, I don't want to go.

571
00:39:39,474 --> 00:39:41,797
Now don't argue.
You can do with a bit of fun.

572
00:39:42,018 --> 00:39:43,617
Come on, plenty of room on top.

573
00:39:50,252 --> 00:39:52,015
Now then, Larry. No speeding, my boy.

574
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:18,033
What on earth would I do
with a thing like this?

575
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:20,554
I ask you. Here, you have it.
- I don't want it.

576
00:40:20,939 --> 00:40:22,895
Don't give it to me. You can have it.
- No.

577
00:40:23,178 --> 00:40:25,053
You know, it will look
wonderful in your study.

578
00:40:25,272 --> 00:40:25,949
Oh no.

00:40:36,735 --> 00:40:38,037
Hello, Emmy.

581
00:40:40,494 --> 00:40:41,468
Remember me?

What's this, then?

00:40:44,291 --> 00:40:47,483
No glad words?
No welcome for your old friend Dan?

584
00:40:49,022 --> 00:40:50,867
It's a bit of a shock
for any girl, isn't it.

585
00:40:51,467 --> 00:40:53,289
When someone pops up
from nowhere and says ..

586
00:40:54,153 --> 00:40:55,866
'Hello, Emmy. Remember me'?
- Well ..

587
00:40:56,692 --> 00:40:57,538
Do you?

588
00:40:58,059 --> 00:41:00,935
Of course I do, Dan.
I'm glad to see you, only ..

589
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:03,623
Only you were kind of hoping
you would never meet me again.

590
00:41:04,404 --> 00:41:06,101
Well, you know me, Emmy.

591

Always turning up like a bad penny.

592
00:41:09,385 --> 00:41:10,549
I'm talking to you.

593
00:41:11,169 --> 00:41:11,984
Look at me.

594
00:41:13,088 --> 00:41:13,931
I'm looking.

595
00:41:14,619 --> 00:41:16,024
That's better.

596
00:41:17,375 --> 00:41:19,944
They told me in that Irish village
of yours where you'd gone.

597
00:41:20,236 --> 00:41:22,334
So I thought to myself, I can wait.

598
00:41:23,115 --> 00:41:25,552
And one of these days
I'll look old Emmy up.

599
00:41:26,386 --> 00:41:29,425
Yes. Emmy will always be glad to see me.

600
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:33,404

joy when she sets eyes on ..

Eh? Isn't that so?

603
00:41:40,817 --> 00:41:42,988
Dan, I'll see you some other time.
- Why?

604
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,056
Afraid your fine friends
may see you with me?

605
00:41:45,203 --> 00:41:47,824
Because I could tell them one or
two things about you. Couldn't I?

606
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:49,071
Couldn't I?

607
00:41:49,781 --> 00:41:52,119
Yes. A dark horse, you. Ain't you, Emmy?

608
00:41:52,729 --> 00:41:55,015

Remember it?

No.

612

You're not the sort
of girl anyone forgets.

614

I'm happy.

Happier than I've ever been
in the whole of my life.

Don't follow me, Dan.

Now you listen to me, my girl.

620
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:22,680
I found out a few things about you
in that village after you'd gone.

621

Those women knew you, didn't they?

627

No. It's no use, Emmy.

628
00:42:45,263 --> 00:42:46,662
I can't get you out of my mind.

you after this, but I can't.

00:50:36,303 --> 00:50:39,773
I thought I was daft. I woke up and I
could swear I heard the organ playing.

702
00:50:40,445 --> 00:50:41,907
So quiet, like a graveyard.

703
00:50:42,267 --> 00:50:44,583
And the moon frightened me so I
put my head under the sheets.

704
00:50:44,730 --> 00:50:46,008
Of all the fishy stories ..

705
00:50:46,155 --> 00:50:47,413
Some joker, I suppose.

706
00:50:47,633 --> 00:50:49,657
Or the Parson stealing
in for a spot of jazz.

707
00:50:49,804 --> 00:50:52,145
It's eerie. It's made me come
all out in goosepimples again.

708
00:50:52,402 --> 00:50:53,811
Hello Dad. Did you hear it too?

709
00:50:54,228 --> 00:50:56,445
Here is some news for you.
There's been a murder near here.

710
00:50:56,592 --> 00:50:58,494
Young gypsy fellow found
dead in Smithers' barn.

711
00:50:58,813 --> 00:51:00,629
He came from the fair
at Matrick so they say.

712
00:51:00,898 --> 00:51:03,188
We were at the fair last night.
- How horrible.

713
00:51:03,744 --> 00:51:05,388
We might even have bumped into the chap.

714
00:51:05,623 --> 00:51:09,037
The things that are happening in this
village of ours. Organ playing, murders.

715
00:51:09,572 --> 00:51:11,503
It makes you wonder what
is going to happen next.

716
00:51:12,021 --> 00:51:14,997
Well come on. Let's have breakfast
before the bacon gets cold.

717
00:51:17,151 --> 00:51:18,495
Get the bread Emmy, will you.

718
00:51:18,668 --> 00:51:20,903
Come on, dad. Spill it. Let's
have the worst of the news.

719
00:51:21,237 --> 00:51:22,674
In a proper state, old Smithers.

720
00:51:22,915 --> 00:51:24,932
No-one likes to find a young
gypsy dead in his barn.

721
00:51:25,178 --> 00:51:26,880
Wouldn't know who
it was but for the dog.

722
00:51:27,134 --> 00:51:28,986
Dog?
- Hmm. A big brute of a thing.

723
00:51:29,274 --> 00:51:31,403
He kept Standing over him.
Wouldn't let anyone get near.

724
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:33,717
There was a chap hanging
around here. He had a dog.

725
00:51:34,488 --> 00:51:35,861
Up to mischief, if it was him.

726
00:51:36,216 --> 00:51:37,514
He has found it now.

727
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:41,333
For what we are about to receive may
The Lord make us truly thankful. Amen.

728
00:52:17,208 --> 00:52:18,686
I wouldn't stand there too long.

729
00:52:21,224 --> 00:52:21,866
No?

730
00:52:22,842 --> 00:52:23,854
And why not?

731
00:52:24,131 --> 00:52:27,107
It ain't healthy. You'll have the sea
over your feet before you know it.

732
00:52:27,998 --> 00:52:29,239
Very tricky, these tides.

733
00:52:29,603 --> 00:52:31,755
The sea comes flooding round
the headland there, and ..

734
00:52:31,936 --> 00:52:33,909
Quick as a flash, you'll
be under water there.

735
00:52:39,035 --> 00:52:42,319
Still, you wouldn't expect a farm
girl to know much about tides.

736
00:52:43,150 --> 00:52:45,005
And how do you know where I come from?

737
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:46,948
Oh, I keep my eyes open, I do.

738
00:52:47,492 --> 00:52:49,251
You work up at the
Tallent farm, don't you.

739
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:51,221
You are Emmy Beaudine.

740
00:52:52,456 --> 00:52:53,925
It's nice to be famous, isn't it.

741
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,098
Well, I know you too.

742
00:52:57,637 --> 00:52:58,756
You are David Price.

743
00:53:00,736 --> 00:53:02,544
Many is the time I've
wanted to talk to you.

744
00:53:03,364 --> 00:53:06,148
I've seen you here before.
Standing just the way you are now.

745
00:53:07,177 --> 00:53:08,350
Looking out to sea.

746
00:53:09,755 --> 00:53:11,355
Not many people come to this cove.

747
00:53:13,332 --> 00:53:15,597
But you and me have the kind
of feeling it belongs to us.

748
00:53:16,816 --> 00:53:18,078
You do like it here?

749
00:53:18,942 --> 00:53:20,104
It's my favourite spot.

750
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:22,385
It is so.

751
00:53:23,547 --> 00:53:25,165
I just stand here alone.

752
00:53:25,611 --> 00:53:27,381
Watching that sea come rushing in.

753
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:29,441
And thinking maybe ..

754
00:53:30,461 --> 00:53:31,769
It's just like me, that sea.

755
00:53:33,044 --> 00:53:34,173
Nothing holds it back.

756
00:53:35,094 --> 00:53:36,853
You would never think
it had such strength.

757
00:53:37,686 --> 00:53:40,860
And then its hands come out and
crash on the rocks and tear at them.

758
00:53:41,236 --> 00:53:42,901
And all the thunder is in your ears.

759
00:53:44,067 --> 00:53:46,203
You know, you are not
like a servant girl at all.

760
00:53:47,331 --> 00:53:49,261
I'm sorry. What I mean is, you ..

761
00:53:49,481 --> 00:53:50,795
I know what you mean.

762
00:53:52,237 --> 00:53:53,881
Then I'm not like any other girl, am I.

763
00:53:56,273 --> 00:53:58,014
Oh. Here she comes. I told you so.

764
00:53:59,153 --> 00:54:00,282
Here, let me help you.

765
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:08,097
Would you like me to show you
somewhere where it is safer?

766
00:54:09,516 --> 00:54:10,742
Quieter. You know.

767
00:54:11,728 --> 00:54:14,127
Yes. I would like that a lot.

768
00:54:15,348 --> 00:54:17,721

772
00:54:44,384 --> 00:54:45,914
Got himself into the papers at last.

773
00:54:46,208 --> 00:54:48,547
I know where David is.
- Oh you do, do you?

774
00:54:48,809 --> 00:54:50,632
And where, might one
ask, Mr Sherlock Holmes?

775
00:54:51,017 --> 00:54:52,919
Having a bit of fun in York.
That's where he is.

776
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:55,761
I don't blame him either.
This village is as dull as death.

777
00:54:56,315 --> 00:54:57,906
People are worried about him though.

778
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:02,817
It's odd for a lad like David to just
disappear off the face of the earth.

779
00:55:04,112 --> 00:55:06,797
Bob. The earth is big enough
for him to be somewhere on it.

780
00:55:07,314 --> 00:55:08,787
He's only been missing a few days.

782

Why, there's that dog again.

783
00:55:18,358 --> 00:55:20,257
They ought to get the
poor creature rounded up.

784
00:55:20,592 --> 00:55:22,637
It's been out on the moor
since that gypsy was found.

785
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:24,530
Pathetic, isn't it.

786
00:55:26,029 --> 00:55:27,130
It's frightening too.

787
00:55:28,518 --> 00:55:29,852
I can just imagine that ..

788
00:55:29,999 --> 00:55:32,920
Poor brute wandering around the
place where his master was found.

789
00:55:34,758 --> 00:55:36,031
Knowing as little as we do.

790
00:55:39,245 --> 00:55:40,746
I'm getting a feverish imagination.

- Yes, right.

792
00:55:45,213 --> 00:55:47,134

793
00:55:47,914 --> 00:55:48,786
Don't go yet.

794
00:55:50,314 --> 00:55:51,558
You are upset, aren't you.

00:55:52,421 --> 00:55:53,250

What is it? David Price?

797
00:55:57,591 --> 00:56:00,677
Do you know .. I don't think
we shall ever see him again.

At least, alive.

799

Don't look at me as
if I were crazy, Bob.

00:56:06,592 --> 00:56:07,378
I feel it.

801
00:56:07,991 --> 00:56:08,960
I am certain.

802
00:56:10,254 --> 00:56:11,498

805
00:56:18,183 --> 00:56:20,062
There's no connection between the two.

00:56:20,652 --> 00:56:22,182
You're letting it prey on you, Bess.

808
00:56:25,785 --> 00:56:27,363

- Hey.

809
00:56:28,528 --> 00:56:29,319
I'm sorry.

810
00:56:30,417 --> 00:56:32,262
I know it's not like me
to be upset this way.

811
00:56:33,173 --> 00:56:36,324
Remember the night I told you the church
organ played and that boy Dan was found?

812
00:56:36,494 --> 00:56:38,597
You're not going to bring
that silly business up again.

I can't get it out of my mind.

It seems to haunt me.

What the devil is the connection ..

00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:46,621
Between some fathead playing the organ
and the death of that gypsy fellow?

817
00:56:47,224 --> 00:56:48,437
One is just daft.

818
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:50,068
The other is evil.

819
00:56:50,617 --> 00:56:52,217

any good with these.

- Aye. It was nothing but a clout.

Right heart-breaking it is.

845

01:15:29,325 --> 01:15:30,168
Yellow eyes.

1048
01:15:32,959 --> 01:15:34,375
Why are you so frightened of it?

1049
01:15:35,772 --> 01:15:37,016
Stay with me for a little.

1050
01:15:38,552 --> 01:15:39,796
I don't want to go to bed.

1051
01:15:41,109 --> 01:15:42,525
When I go to my window at night.

1052
01:15:44,111 --> 01:15:45,240
And there's that dog.

1053
01:15:46,071 --> 01:15:47,180
Standing in the yard.

1054
01:15:47,901 --> 01:15:48,659
So quiet.

1055
01:15:50,210 --> 01:15:51,082
Just looking.

1056
01:15:51,499 --> 01:15:52,342
And looking.

1057
01:15:59,286 --> 01:16:00,984
Emmy .. you are terrifying.

1058
01:16:03,101 --> 01:16:04,761
There is something dreadful about you.

1059
01:16:06,478 --> 01:16:08,231
Whatever it is,
it's getting out of here.

1060
01:16:09,266 --> 01:16:12,002
You'll pack your things the moment
it's light and get out of this house.

1061
01:16:13,778 --> 01:16:15,045
You can't do that to me.

1062
01:16:16,121 --> 01:16:17,306
I've nowhere to go.

1063
01:16:17,870 --> 01:16:19,114
I don't care where you go.

1064
01:16:19,703 --> 01:16:20,718
So long as you go.

1065
01:16:22,654 --> 01:16:24,478
You are a heartless, wicked woman.

1066
01:16:25,078 --> 01:16:26,678
Just throwing me out like that.

1067
01:16:28,177 --> 01:16:29,998
I have to have a roof over my head.

1068
01:16:30,351 --> 01:16:31,116
Get out!

1069
01:16:32,411 --> 01:16:33,202
My notice?

1070
01:16:33,923 --> 01:16:35,024
I'll pay your notice.

1071
01:16:35,928 --> 01:16:37,968
And don't come to this
part of the world again.

1072
01:16:40,682 --> 01:16:41,963
You'll be sorry for this.

1073
01:16:45,833 --> 01:16:46,505
Sorry.

1074
01:16:47,218 --> 01:16:48,269
Just you see.

1075
01:16:52,574 --> 01:16:53,759
What's going on?

1076
01:16:57,137 --> 01:16:58,324
What's the matter, Bess?

1077
01:16:59,429 --> 01:17:00,379
Not now, Bob.

1078
01:17:00,999 --> 01:17:02,815
I couldn't bear any more.
- Well, what is it?

1079
01:17:04,649 --> 01:17:05,778
I've just sacked Emmy.

1080
01:17:06,066 --> 01:17:06,824
Have you?

1081
01:17:07,306 --> 01:17:08,459
Well, that's alright.

1082
01:17:09,627 --> 01:17:10,314
Bob.

1083
01:17:10,465 --> 01:17:12,367
There's no need for you
to be so upset about it.

1084
01:17:12,850 --> 01:17:13,579
Come on.

1085
01:17:14,062 --> 01:17:15,461
You need a good night's sleep.

1086
01:17:19,869 --> 01:17:21,885
She'll be gone in the morning.
You can bank on that.

1087
01:17:23,095 --> 01:17:24,854
You've had quite a day
one way and another.

1088
01:17:26,523 --> 01:17:28,991
Larry. Switch the lights
off and lock up, will you.

1089
01:17:29,790 --> 01:17:30,548
Yes, Bob.

1090
01:18:26,943 --> 01:18:27,995
Major, come on.

1091
01:18:28,408 --> 01:18:30,138
Come on, Major.
Time for you to go to bed.

1092
01:18:30,371 --> 01:18:31,891
Lie down. Go on, lie down.

1093
01:18:33,659 --> 01:18:36,279
Have you behaved yourself today?
I bet you haven't.

1094

Lie down. Lie down. Go on, lie down.

Yes. Constable Manley speaking.
Who's that?

1098
01:19:47,664 --> 01:19:49,802
George, drat you.
Do you know the time of night?

1099
01:19:51,147 --> 01:19:51,990
What's that?

1100
01:19:53,373 --> 01:19:54,920
Larry Tallent. Dead.

Yes George, I'll be with
you as fast as I can.

1106
01:20:07,121 --> 01:20:08,394
She's out by Loomis's farm.

1107
01:20:08,576 --> 01:20:10,943
Out on the moors?
Well, she's welcome to it in this.

1108
01:20:11,196 --> 01:20:13,344
Alright lads. Spread out and
keep your eyes skinned.

1109
01:20:13,491 --> 01:20:14,931
Come on, gang. Ready, Saul?

1110
01:20:15,149 --> 01:20:16,621
I'll get Bob.
- Alright.

1112
01:20:27,168 --> 01:20:29,027
Don't try to console me anymore, Bob.

1113
01:20:30,510 --> 01:20:31,411
You mean well.

1114
01:20:32,247 --> 01:20:33,243
Just don't.

1115
01:20:33,862 --> 01:20:35,699
You are so quiet and calm.

1116
01:20:36,980 --> 01:20:38,963
I wish you wouldn't try
and hold it in like this.

1117
01:20:39,655 --> 01:20:41,071
I wish you would cry like Julie.

1118
01:20:42,186 --> 01:20:43,430
She'll feel better for it.

1119
01:20:44,750 --> 01:20:45,955
I'm not the crying kind.

1120
01:20:47,172 --> 01:20:48,273
I've just got to sit.

1121
01:20:48,675 --> 01:20:49,461
And think.

1122
01:20:56,815 --> 01:20:58,034
Bob. We're ready.

1123
01:21:03,529 --> 01:21:04,468
Hello, Bess.

01:21:04,886 --> 01:21:05,782
How's Julie?

1125
01:21:06,059 --> 01:21:06,874
Better now.

1126
01:21:07,252 --> 01:21:08,353
Mum got her to sleep.

1127
01:21:10,097 --> 01:21:11,398
I sent the wire to your dad.

1128
01:21:11,582 --> 01:21:13,284
The train ought to get
him in by morning.

1129
01:21:13,788 --> 01:21:14,777
Thank you, Saul.

1130
01:21:15,967 --> 01:21:16,982
Be back presently.

1131
01:21:17,882 --> 01:21:19,011

1138
01:23:42,069 --> 01:23:43,170

1139

No.

Don't.

She'll never see him again.
