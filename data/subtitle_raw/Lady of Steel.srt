1
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:36,296
Stop

2
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,205
Sir, would you like a room?

3
00:00:42,308 --> 00:00:43,741
I need a couple of deluxe rooms,
could you show me?

4
00:00:43,843 --> 00:00:45,174
Yes, please

5
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:49,240
Are you alright?

6
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:50,611
Yes

7
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,651
Nanny, help the Mistress in to have
some rest

8
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:53,650
Yes

9
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:03,395
You go to your room first

10
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:04,589
Yes

11
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:11,233
Put it upstairs

12
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:12,326
Yes

13
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:21,404
Brother, don't mind me saying this

14
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:24,142
you knew the journey would be difficult

15
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,946
and bringing along family is inconvenient

16
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:29,021
I have no choice

17
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:30,749
Since I married your sister-in-law

18
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:33,291
she hasn't returned home

19
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:35,554
Her home happens to be enroute
as we escort the goods

20
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:38,893
Ying Qi too might as well have
a reunion with grandpa

21
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:42,365
However we haven't used this road
for a long time

22
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:45,802
and we're escorting
a million taels of silver this time

23
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:47,930
It's best to be cautious

24
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:54,107
Sincere apologies
if I've lacked in my services

25
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,615
So it's chief Han

26
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:03,177
No... I retired long ago

27
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:07,385
just running a small business here

28
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:10,327
Please bear with the humble service

29
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,130
Waiter

30
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:11,897
Yes

31
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:15,092
Bring us food and wine

32
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:16,327
I want to drink to my heart's content

33
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:19,564
with security chief Fang... its my treat

34
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:20,969
Thanks, that's not necessary

35
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:24,669
I can still afford to be the host

36
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:26,369
If you refuse

37
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,573
I'll assume that you give me no face

38
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:32,849
It'd be my pleasure then

39
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:35,819
That's more like it

40
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:39,916
Chief Fang

41
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:43,257
what goods are you escorting this time?

42
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:46,561
Money for refugees along the Yellow River

43
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:51,603
With your fame as the Iron Arm

44
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:54,867
who'd dare to do anything?

45
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:57,568
You needn't take the trouble yourself

46
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,372
You're too kind

47
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:03,210
Overflowing of the river has made
many refugees suffer

48
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:06,581
I am just doing my part

49
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:11,851
I respect you, it's good fortune that
we meet today

50
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,893
Let me raise you a toast

51
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:18,361
Chief Han, brother Fang has said that
the refugees

52
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:20,932
are still suffering & await our money;

53
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,832
It isn't likely that he'd be
in a mood to drink

54
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:27,100
Instead, let's drink on our return

55
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:31,443
You don't appreciate our respect

56
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:49,286
I fear you will have no way out

57
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:53,564
What do you want?

58
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:59,031
Leave the money, or else

59
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:00,105
don't even think of it

60
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:13,983
How much more?

61
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,145
Almost done

62
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,759
Ying Qi...

63
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,192
Dad, I'm scared

64
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,058
Ying Qi...

65
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:44,006
Let's go

66
00:05:58,725 --> 00:05:59,953
Ying Qi...

67
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:25,633
Come

68
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:02,377
Girl, your kung fu's accomplished,
come down

69
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:12,619
Teacher, I've brought food
to go along with your wine

70
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:14,818
Ying Qi, come here

71
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:25,268
You want to go downhill, right?

72
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:37,806
Teacher, you said Han Shi Xiong
is still alive?

73
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:39,714
This fellow

74
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:42,947
has not shown his face for years

75
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:47,788
Even if he's dead I still want to
desecrate his corpse

76
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:56,492
I support your departure

77
00:08:56,602 --> 00:09:01,096
but the time is not yet ripe for revenge

78
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:09,707
The Jins are invading our country

79
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:11,783
The officials

80
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:15,547
are cowards and think only of
their welfare

81
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:17,350
We martial artists

82
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:21,916
should not just stand by and
let this happen

83
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:26,864
I want to serve my country
even if it means death

84
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,933
Good

85
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:31,901
But this matter

86
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:35,337
is not one that could be tackled alone

87
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:36,771
You take this letter

88
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:41,575
to the Flying Dragon Fortress
in Da Kun Mountain

89
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:43,171
and find Lord Xia

90
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:45,443
He is gathering heroes

91
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:47,348
to re-establish our country

92
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:51,446
Give him the letter and he'll know
what to do

93
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:53,957
The letter is important

94
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,618
so keep it well

95
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:58,822
Never lose it to the hands of villains

96
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,296
Don't worry

97
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,269
"Yi On Inn"

98
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:27,526
Excuse... sir, inside please

99
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:32,721
Welcome

100
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:38,403
Upstairs please

101
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:55,117
Is this room acceptable?

102
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,546
It will do

103
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:01,793
Please leave your name

104
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:11,903
Thanks

105
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:15,202
Excuse me, how far is it to the
Da Kun Mountain?

106
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:18,140
It's about 20 miles ahead

107
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:26,176
Master Wu has asked you to give this pill

108
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:29,721
to Chief Ba Shan

109
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:30,846
There's a secret message inside

110
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:33,584
listing the names of generals
guarding the frontier

111
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,320
and the strength of their troops

112
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:39,831
We are waiting for his further
instructions

113
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:45,203
I will give it to him the soonest I can

114
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:48,398
It's top secret, be careful

115
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:50,941
Don't worry... it's not the first time

116
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:55,207
This is a reward from Master Wu

117
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:56,144
We'll divide it equally

118
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:56,948
Good...

119
00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:02,851
Boss, there are many beggars outside

120
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:05,446
Would the beggars' gang be
causing trouble again?

121
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,822
Could our plan to help Master Wu

122
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:09,861
to contact with Jins have been exposed?

123
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:11,261
I'll leave first

124
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:14,756
Inform me of chief Ba Shan's reply
the moment you've it

125
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,232
Master Yan, wait

126
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:20,032
it's better to take the back door

127
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:21,265
Alright

128
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:25,940
Hey, are you people all dead? Come on out

129
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:28,377
What's up... stay calm

130
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:30,210
Pal, you want to eat?

131
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:33,149
Have a seat, my treat

132
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:35,047
Good

133
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:37,418
In that case

134
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:38,581
we'll come everyday

135
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:41,182
Good

136
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:45,460
Let's just pretend it's my birthday

137
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:48,624
Really? My heartiest congratulations then

138
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:53,433
But I am not eating today, I need a room

139
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,632
Treating you to a meal is not a problem

140
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:57,572
but as regards a room...

141
00:12:57,676 --> 00:13:01,669
What, am I not eligible
if I'm dressed up like this?

142
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,914
Look what this is

143
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:16,692
Enough for a night?

144
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,663
Yes... it's rather too much... waiter

145
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:21,198
Yes

146
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,460
Lead this guest to a room

147
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:25,503
Yes, this way please

148
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:36,443
Sir, this room please

149
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:38,981
I want this one

150
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:42,611
Sorry, it's been taken

151
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:46,316
No way, I must have it

152
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:48,017
Can't you ask him to move out?

153
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:51,028
How can I? He was here first

154
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,927
I don't care, just ask him to leave

155
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:54,294
No

156
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:58,729
I could move

157
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,238
but someone wouldn't agree to that

158
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,500
Who?

159
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:06,204
My sword

160
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:12,178
Want to fight? That's easy, come on

161
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:32,499
Search his room

162
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:58,459
Oh, so it's a beautiful lady;

163
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:02,500
but what a pity for her to be with him

164
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:36,524
Mr. Wei, take a look

165
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,568
Look what this is?

166
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:54,971
"Han Shi Xiong"

167
00:16:57,216 --> 00:17:00,583
How did Han Shi Xiong's dagger
end up with her?

168
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:04,180
It's likely that his enemies caught up
with him

169
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:08,191
Then let's kill her first

170
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,396
"Fang Ying Qi"

171
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:20,105
Fang Ying Qi

172
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:17,118
Are you using the Ice Steel Sword?

173
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:20,928
You admit defeat, right?

174
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,934
Who are you?

175
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:25,435
None of your business

176
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:19,380
Lady, you look so desperate

177
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,721
Alright. Here, I'll return the letter
to you

178
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:52,947
This is the flying dagger you used
20 years ago

179
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:55,686
I'm wondering why would the girl have it?

180
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:57,523
What is that girl's name?

181
00:19:57,629 --> 00:19:58,596
Fang Ying Qi

182
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:06,331
I suspect she's Fang Ning's descendant

183
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:07,632
We slaughtered everyone of the

184
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:09,764
Fang family that year

185
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,207
how could there be any descendant?

186
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:17,740
Maybe one of them got away

187
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:19,874
According to the waiter at Yi On Inn

188
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:22,215
she's headed for Da Kun Mountain

189
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:27,150
Tong Ming, get rid of her

190
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:29,217
Actually, I was thinking of the same thing

191
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:32,058
Let's do it quickly

192
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:33,495
I'll leave first

193
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:36,657
Changing my name to Cai Yi

194
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:38,633
I am now a spy at Da Kun Mountain

195
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:42,195
Last night Xia Zi Long urgently
asked me over

196
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:44,901
to discuss something important

197
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,272
You rest assured and just leave

198
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:50,178
I'll take care of that girl. Farewell

199
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:25,338
Go

200
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:58,042
Miss, why are you being so unreasonable?

201
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,618
You stole my dagger,
why should I reason with you?

202
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:14,062
Whoa, whoa... I stole your flying dagger?

203
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,963
You know what you did

204
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:18,866
Nonsense, it's you who injured my brothers

205
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,801
I have yet to get even with you

206
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:24,635
I simply can't accept the fact that
you bully people

207
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:28,477
You don't know good from bad

208
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,877
What are you talking about?

209
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:32,711
Go back to your room and
take a look, you'll know

210
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:38,081
Miss, don't sleep tonight

211
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,987
Beware, someone might ambush you

212
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:05,572
Shoot

213
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:27,597
I'll deal with them

214
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:07,296
May I have your name?

215
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:10,397
I am head of the Beggars' Clan,
Qin Shang Yi

216
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:13,503
My respects. I am Fang Ying Qi

217
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:16,240
on teacher's orders to go to
Da Kun Mountain

218
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:17,246
I know

219
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,941
You do?

220
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,574
I read your letter yesterday

221
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:22,778
and know you're a righteous heroine

222
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:25,618
So I protected you secretly on the way

223
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:28,158
I am in your debt

224
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,285
Since we are on the same side

225
00:25:30,395 --> 00:25:32,329
you needn't stand on ceremony

226
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:36,724
You really never took my flying dagger?

227
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:39,269
No, I fear it has been

228
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,862
retained by Wei Tong Ming

229
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,373
What is he like?

230
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:48,139
He is a traitor

231
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:49,975
I parleyed with him yesterday

232
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:53,278
in order to get evidence of his treason

233
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:57,379
I almost mistook him for a good guy...
so stupid of me!

234
00:25:57,489 --> 00:26:00,890
Miss Fang, appearances deceive

235
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:04,519
You ought to be careful all the time

236
00:26:05,363 --> 00:26:08,298
That's really a good advice

237
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,595
I'll always remember it

238
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,335
Where's our big brother?

239
00:26:12,437 --> 00:26:16,339
Over there...

240
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:21,007
Miss Fang, there's still 20 miles
to Da Kun Mountain

241
00:26:21,112 --> 00:26:23,103
You'd better set off earlier

242
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:24,738
Alright

243
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,229
Let me see you off

244
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:42,732
No need. Brother Qin, see you later

245
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:44,563
Be careful then

246
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:56,140
"Flying Dragon Fortress"

247
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:02,642
I've got reports

248
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:06,918
that Wu Chang Sheng
bribed corrupted officials

249
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:11,359
to obtain confidential news and
play traitor with Jins

250
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:15,399
That's why I invite you all here
for a discussion

251
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,958
Wu Chang Sheng is rich and powerful

252
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:22,062
Seeing the Jin army's prowess

253
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:23,572
and fearing for his assets

254
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:25,905
he ingratiates the Jins

255
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:27,444
and chief Ba Shan

256
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:29,672
He is bent on selling the country
for his own advantage

257
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:32,776
Our Flying Dragon clan

258
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:37,184
is committed to ridding our country
of traitors

259
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:41,725
Now that we've confirmed
Wu Chang Sheng is a traitor

260
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:43,191
we should get rid of him

261
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:44,022
Right

262
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:45,494
Chief Cai is right

263
00:27:45,597 --> 00:27:47,462
But Wu Chang Sheng's Black Wind Fort

264
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:50,261
has lots of good fighters, and he has also

265
00:27:50,368 --> 00:27:54,065
solicited the aid of many
villainous mercenaries

266
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:57,608
It wouldn't be easy to get rid of him

267
00:27:57,709 --> 00:27:59,108
You needn't let his

268
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:02,646
power diminish your confidence

269
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,276
You...

270
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:06,612
Please, stop quarrelling

271
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:09,482
this is not the time to argue

272
00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:11,248
We mustn't land ourselves in a
disadvantageous position

273
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:16,191
& should devise a plan to get rid of
Wu Chang Sheng

274
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:18,990
That's what we need to do today;

275
00:28:19,097 --> 00:28:20,621
to find a way to go against Wu Chang Sheng

276
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:23,360
My lord, someone requests to see you

277
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:29,297
Priest Xuan Zhen, please invite him
at once

278
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:30,704
Yes

279
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:33,135
He's here

280
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:35,644
That's great, he could give us a hand

281
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:37,942
We are now stronger than ever

282
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:39,107
Look who's here

283
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:41,584
It's a girl

284
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,717
This is Lord Xia

285
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:53,923
My respects, I am Fang Ying Qi

286
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:57,458
You are?

287
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,628
I am priest Xuan Zhen's student

288
00:29:01,005 --> 00:29:02,905
this is a letter for you from him

289
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:04,235
What about priest Xuan Zhen?

290
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:06,333
Being old and feeble

291
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:09,106
he has sent me instead

292
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:10,875
to receive your orders

293
00:29:10,982 --> 00:29:13,075
Great...

294
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:19,554
Since you are his best student

295
00:29:19,657 --> 00:29:21,352
I guess you must have learnt a lot
from him

296
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:25,293
Please demonstrate some of your skills

297
00:29:25,396 --> 00:29:27,057
What do you all think?

298
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:29,895
Great, it's a wonderful idea

299
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:32,462
I will comply with your wish

300
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:35,095
Please give me your valued guidance

301
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:17,038
Great...

302
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,342
Very good...

303
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:19,939
Thank you...

304
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:22,246
Indeed a great master trains
great students

305
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:23,251
You're too kind

306
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:25,015
You must be tired

307
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:26,488
please go and rest

308
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:27,319
Thank you

309
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:29,256
Escort Miss Fang to take a rest

310
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,486
Yes

311
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:31,391
Please

312
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,054
I'll take my leave

313
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:34,529
Please

314
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:44,703
Lord Xia, Miss Fang's skills are marvelous

315
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:46,902
and is indeed a top student of the priest

316
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:48,069
Right...

317
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:50,579
I want to send her to assassinate
Wu Chang Sheng

318
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:53,344
I think she'll surely succeed

319
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:55,885
What do you think?

320
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:28,496
Attack

321
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:39,449
Chase

322
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:47,521
Attack

323
00:34:43,714 --> 00:34:45,614
Use more power and come up

324
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:54,554
Go ahead, I'll cover your back

325
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:36,658
Mount your horse, quick

326
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,717
Let's rest here

327
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:05,852
Thanks for your help, what's your name?

328
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:13,161
Oh, Brother Qin, it's you

329
00:36:13,604 --> 00:36:17,165
Wu Chang Sheng harms the country
and people

330
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:19,937
I have been wanting to kill him

331
00:36:20,044 --> 00:36:23,536
I have been impersonating a time keeper

332
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:26,776
and been waiting for the right opportunity

333
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:29,284
but I haven't been able to sneak in

334
00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:33,915
Today I saw them lay many traps

335
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,152
and planted ambush everywhere

336
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:39,354
Something is bound to happen tonight

337
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:40,862
I didn't expect it would be you

338
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:42,694
Did you throw the tiles

339
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,735
in the alley to warn me just now?

340
00:36:45,836 --> 00:36:49,795
However, you didn't take heed
and almost got killed

341
00:36:52,743 --> 00:36:58,545
You have once again risked your life
to save me

342
00:36:58,649 --> 00:37:00,742
I really don't know how to thank you

343
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:02,546
Please don't misunderstand me

344
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:07,522
I didn't do it for this reason

345
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:10,359
To know a friend like you

346
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:12,622
is my good fortune

347
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,664
You flatter me

348
00:37:23,307 --> 00:37:30,270
I hope that one day amity would
prevail in this country

349
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:34,511
so we can establish a restful home

350
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:36,746
and enjoy a peaceful life

351
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,323
I am a beggar

352
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:45,794
and sort of used to a tough life
and hunger

353
00:37:45,896 --> 00:37:50,492
A good life is alien to me

354
00:37:52,536 --> 00:37:55,801
Why are you going to Black Wind Fort?

355
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:58,903
This was an order from Da Kun Mountain

356
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:03,504
That's strange, could there be a spy?

357
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,775
How so?

358
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:08,511
They know Black Wind Fort

359
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,780
is heavily guarded

360
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:14,585
why would they send you there all alone?

361
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:16,353
Besides, Wu Chang Sheng

362
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,792
seemed to know in advance
you were going there

363
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:20,227
Right

364
00:38:20,698 --> 00:38:22,689
Whose idea was it?

365
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,769
I hear it was Cai Yi's

366
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,667
Cai Yi?

367
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:31,369
I see

368
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:53,586
Lord Xia, you still haven't rested

369
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:56,223
Ying Qi has not returned

370
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,097
how could I be at rest

371
00:38:58,202 --> 00:39:02,036
Same as I

372
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:04,107
If anything happens to her

373
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:06,699
how could I face priest Xuan Zhen?

374
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:12,408
It's almost dawn,
I think she may have failed

375
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:14,575
Mr. Cai, please give the orders

376
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,846
Gather all men before dawn

377
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:18,182
and attack Black Wind Fort

378
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:20,484
We must save Ying Qi

379
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:23,089
No need

380
00:39:27,998 --> 00:39:29,329
Ying Qi

381
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:31,298
Master Cai, I am back

382
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:35,637
You had me worried sick

383
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:36,968
It seemed Wu Chang Sheng was prepared

384
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:38,200
and fighters were hidden everywhere

385
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:40,470
I had no chance to go in

386
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:42,639
Are you hurt?

387
00:39:43,914 --> 00:39:45,711
I was surrounded

388
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:48,614
and broke through with much effort

389
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:51,950
Though I did not accomplish my mission

390
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:53,921
I managed to snatch their flag

391
00:39:54,024 --> 00:39:56,083
to cheer up our spirits

392
00:39:56,761 --> 00:40:00,094
Am I right? Master Cai

393
00:40:00,197 --> 00:40:03,325
Yes... you are great

394
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:06,062
Ying Qi, take a rest first

395
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:08,195
I'll take my leave then

396
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:11,499
You should rest too

397
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:12,371
Yes

398
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:21,315
What? Fang Ying Qi survived?

399
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,284
That's unexpected

400
00:40:25,022 --> 00:40:28,355
Maybe it's not yet time for her to die

401
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:31,360
Her kung fu is really good

402
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:34,863
Even Qin Shang Yi was no match for her

403
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:37,365
He fought with her?

404
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:41,130
They came to know each other through
a fight

405
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:43,103
Just pure chance

406
00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:46,199
but now they are the best of friends

407
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:51,945
Right, we'll use their relationship

408
00:40:52,049 --> 00:40:54,483
to kill her

409
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:04,421
Someone's coming

410
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:08,291
Take a look quickly

411
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,562
Don't move, what are you doing here?

412
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:14,834
Why are you behaving suspiciously?

413
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:16,201
I am looking for Miss Fang Ying Qi

414
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:19,140
He must be a spy, bring him to Lord Xia

415
00:41:19,543 --> 00:41:20,635
I am no spy

416
00:41:20,744 --> 00:41:22,609
What do you want with miss Fang?

417
00:41:22,713 --> 00:41:25,181
Our Chief Qin has asked me
to deliver a letter to her

418
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:27,045
Where's the letter?

419
00:41:27,551 --> 00:41:28,575
I must give it to her in person

420
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:33,180
Nonsense, hand it out

421
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:35,087
Miss Fang is here

422
00:41:35,192 --> 00:41:36,716
Miss Fang, this person is looking for you

423
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:38,124
For me?

424
00:41:38,929 --> 00:41:41,523
Our Chief Qin has asked me
to deliver a letter to you

425
00:41:48,772 --> 00:41:51,969
These food supplies will be delivered
to the Jins

426
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:54,840
They will be delivered to
the frontier in 4 carriages

427
00:41:54,945 --> 00:41:57,175
via Ba Xian Mountain straight to Ku Peak

428
00:41:57,281 --> 00:42:01,411
Unfortunately I don't have the
manpower to rob it

429
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:04,015
How dare Wu Chang Sheng
deliver groceries to the Jins!

430
00:42:04,121 --> 00:42:05,418
Damn it

431
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,991
Wu Chang Sheng would bring sorrow
to the people

432
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:08,725
That means

433
00:42:08,726 --> 00:42:10,591
we must get hold of his rations

434
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:12,093
and not let it fall into the hands of Jins

435
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:15,359
That's right...

436
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:21,395
Miss Fang, is the news reliable?

437
00:42:21,505 --> 00:42:26,033
Definitely, you need not worry about it

438
00:42:26,143 --> 00:42:27,542
Tomorrow is the eighth day of the month

439
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:29,909
We'll bring some men to lay ambush

440
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:31,606
and crush them head on

441
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:35,583
Alright, tomorrow we'll go
separate ways in 5 teams

442
00:42:35,686 --> 00:42:37,711
The first team will be led by Lord Fei

443
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:39,516
and intercept them at the south
of Ba Xian Mountain

444
00:42:39,623 --> 00:42:41,989
The second team will be led by
Lord Gong Sun

445
00:42:42,092 --> 00:42:44,356
and intercept them at the west
of Ba Xian Mountain

446
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:31,937
Attack

447
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:28,294
We have suffered great losses this time

448
00:44:28,399 --> 00:44:31,232
because we were not discreet enough

449
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:34,202
The enemies knew of our plan beforehand

450
00:44:34,304 --> 00:44:36,272
and took precautions

451
00:44:36,373 --> 00:44:39,570
Does it mean we have a traitor amongst us?

452
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:43,912
I knew from the very start

453
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:47,347
that the news was fake

454
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:50,843
Miss Fang, I don't understand

455
00:44:50,954 --> 00:44:53,946
why did you do that,
what's your intention?

456
00:44:54,058 --> 00:44:55,616
What do you mean?

457
00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:00,692
Lord Fei, you suspect
there's a traitor among us

458
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:04,632
I think the traitor is right
in front of us here

459
00:45:04,735 --> 00:45:06,430
Chief Cai, what proof do you have?

460
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:07,799
Proof?

461
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:11,406
Lord Xia, will you please go
and search her room

462
00:45:11,508 --> 00:45:14,204
Maybe you'll find something out

463
00:45:14,311 --> 00:45:15,903
Alright, let's go

464
00:45:17,481 --> 00:45:21,941
Wait, you want to search my room...
with pleasure

465
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:23,451
Chief Cai

466
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:26,648
But what if you can't find anything?

467
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:28,554
Then it'll be my stupidity

468
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:30,286
and I'm willing to be punished

469
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:31,554
Really?

470
00:45:31,662 --> 00:45:35,325
Yes, and no regrets. Go

471
00:45:45,275 --> 00:45:45,908
Search

472
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:46,876
Yes

473
00:46:09,633 --> 00:46:12,534
A traitor should be
sentenced to death, take her

474
00:46:14,805 --> 00:46:17,603
Ying Qi, speak whatever you have to say

475
00:46:18,075 --> 00:46:20,942
Lord Cai, what's your intention
in doing this?

476
00:46:21,645 --> 00:46:22,345
Take her away

477
00:46:22,379 --> 00:46:22,979
Go

478
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:25,915
Wait, I don't deal underhandedly

479
00:46:26,016 --> 00:46:28,985
The truth will be out one day

480
00:47:25,442 --> 00:47:31,278
Hurry and chase

481
00:47:51,735 --> 00:47:52,599
Brother Wai, you are here

482
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:53,849
Is your manager here?

483
00:47:53,884 --> 00:47:54,995
He... he's inside...

484
00:48:02,312 --> 00:48:03,836
Sir, have a seat inside

485
00:48:13,991 --> 00:48:15,356
Sir, this way please

486
00:48:25,936 --> 00:48:26,925
What would you like to eat?

487
00:48:27,037 --> 00:48:28,800
A catty of wine, a dish of spicy meat

488
00:48:29,172 --> 00:48:31,970
A catty of wine, a dish of spicy meat

489
00:48:39,016 --> 00:48:40,313
How come he's not here yet?

490
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:41,679
There're too many people here

491
00:48:41,785 --> 00:48:43,446
Let's talk inside

492
00:48:48,825 --> 00:48:49,917
Coming, it's yours

493
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:55,063
Yan Ji Jiang is not here yet?

494
00:48:55,165 --> 00:48:57,565
No, what happened?

495
00:49:04,374 --> 00:49:07,810
Chief Ba Shan's letter came
a few days late

496
00:49:07,911 --> 00:49:09,879
Wu Chang Sheng is very anxious

497
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:12,710
Could something have happened
to Yan Ji Jiang enroute?

498
00:49:12,816 --> 00:49:13,942
I don't think so

499
00:49:14,051 --> 00:49:16,952
Yan Ji Jiang isn't a careless person

500
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:19,512
I must attend to some business
at Shan Yang Province

501
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:21,352
and will be back in 10 to 14 days

502
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:22,720
If Yan Ji Jiang comes,

503
00:49:22,826 --> 00:49:24,123
give the confidential letter to Master Wu

504
00:49:24,227 --> 00:49:25,956
I will, don't worry

505
00:49:26,063 --> 00:49:27,223
I'll be off then

506
00:49:35,872 --> 00:49:38,340
"Green Station"

507
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,300
Master Yan, you are here again

508
00:49:41,411 --> 00:49:42,673
Yes, is business good?

509
00:49:42,779 --> 00:49:44,770
Not bad... have a seat please...

510
00:49:44,881 --> 00:49:45,905
Alright

511
00:49:48,585 --> 00:49:51,281
Have some tea and rest. Waiter,
bring some tea

512
00:49:51,388 --> 00:49:52,446
Yes, coming

513
00:49:54,257 --> 00:49:55,849
Master Yan, have some tea

514
00:49:55,959 --> 00:49:56,755
Alright

515
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:58,384
Master Yan is such a busy man

516
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:00,690
and has to be here two or three times
a month

517
00:50:00,797 --> 00:50:03,197
Well, one has to make a living... no choice

518
00:50:05,268 --> 00:50:06,895
He's Yan Ji Jiang

519
00:50:10,807 --> 00:50:11,507
Thank you

520
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:40,931
Butterflies & bees visit
flowers blossoming in spring

521
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:56,352
they are like lovers who cling to
each other

522
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:17,702
Strolling along a flowery path
soothed by gentle breeze

523
00:51:17,808 --> 00:51:25,579
The declining days of spring
cannot be retained

524
00:51:25,682 --> 00:51:33,817
what is in your heart that cannot be said?

525
00:51:35,125 --> 00:51:36,990
Great

526
00:51:45,135 --> 00:51:46,898
Not bad

527
00:51:47,804 --> 00:51:49,635
Thank you

528
00:51:49,739 --> 00:51:51,366
Good, good

529
00:53:27,604 --> 00:53:29,299
"From Yan Ji Jiang"

530
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:35,868
Yan Ji Jiang? How come he's here?

531
00:53:37,514 --> 00:53:38,276
Where's he?

532
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:39,973
He's waiting at the courtyard

533
00:53:58,001 --> 00:54:00,731
Greetings to Lord Wu

534
00:54:00,837 --> 00:54:05,433
Brother Ji Jiang, we've never met

535
00:54:05,542 --> 00:54:08,102
but have already developed
a spiritual nexus with you

536
00:54:08,211 --> 00:54:13,478
Why have you come personally this time?

537
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:14,572
I...

538
00:54:15,285 --> 00:54:17,879
These are my trusted men

539
00:54:17,988 --> 00:54:21,082
Do speak whatever's on your mind

540
00:54:21,191 --> 00:54:23,557
I am under orders from chief Ba Shan

541
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:25,992
to deliver a letter to lord Wu

542
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:27,085
And the letter?

543
00:54:36,706 --> 00:54:39,300
Why didn't you send it to me
through Wei Tong Ming?

544
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:41,570
The roads weren't safe and
so I was delayed for 2 days

545
00:54:41,678 --> 00:54:42,542
Only after getting here I realised

546
00:54:42,646 --> 00:54:44,841
Brother Tong Ming has gone to
the Shan Yang Province

547
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:48,008
Being an important task, I came myself

548
00:54:49,552 --> 00:54:51,179
Wei Tong Ming has gone to
the Shan Yang Province?

549
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:53,756
Yes, his family is there

550
00:54:53,857 --> 00:54:57,315
He said he'll return in about half a month

551
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:02,754
Make yourself at home,
I'll take my leave now

552
00:55:02,866 --> 00:55:03,764
Please

553
00:55:56,686 --> 00:56:01,248
How long would you stay this time?

554
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:02,484
Chief Ba Shan has ordered

555
00:56:02,592 --> 00:56:03,650
if there's anything lord Wu
would like me to do

556
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,728
I'll try my best effort

557
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:07,228
You're too kind...

558
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:10,788
I have a letter that you could give
to Chief Ba Shan

559
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:13,130
Please stay here for a few days

560
00:56:13,236 --> 00:56:14,726
Sorry to bother you

561
00:56:14,838 --> 00:56:15,437
Come, men

562
00:56:15,438 --> 00:56:16,138
Yes

563
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:17,763
Escort master Yan
to the east chamber to rest

564
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:19,034
Yes

565
00:56:19,142 --> 00:56:19,842
Please

566
00:56:19,943 --> 00:56:21,171
Thank you

567
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:24,079
Come, men

568
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,047
Yes

569
00:56:25,148 --> 00:56:26,740
Please invite lord Cai here
for a discussion

570
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:27,908
Yes

571
00:56:29,686 --> 00:56:33,747
What can I do for you, Master Wu?

572
00:56:34,124 --> 00:56:37,389
I have received an order
from Chief Ba Shan

573
00:56:37,494 --> 00:56:42,727
and he has decided to launch attack
next month

574
00:56:42,832 --> 00:56:44,322
and we've been given
till the end of this month

575
00:56:44,434 --> 00:56:47,460
to exterminate the gang
at Da Kun Mountain

576
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:51,529
How should we go about it?

577
00:56:52,142 --> 00:56:54,838
Da Kun Mountain has a lot of
kung fu experts

578
00:56:54,944 --> 00:56:57,913
I don't think

579
00:56:58,014 --> 00:56:59,879
we could do it this easily

580
00:57:00,283 --> 00:57:05,277
That's why I need your advice

581
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:11,057
I've an idea; it's my birthday day
after tomorrow

582
00:57:11,161 --> 00:57:13,527
Under the pretext of celebrating this,

583
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:17,828
Xia Zi Long must come as a guest

584
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:21,301
At that time we could then

585
00:57:21,404 --> 00:57:24,635
corner them and kill them all

586
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:26,003
Good idea

587
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:29,010
I will hide with Bas brothers

588
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:33,276
near Cai's Residence and await

589
00:57:33,383 --> 00:57:34,475
your orders to ambush them

590
00:57:34,584 --> 00:57:37,178
Right, when Xia Zi Long and his men arrive

591
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:40,415
we'll fire signal, what do you think?

592
00:57:40,523 --> 00:57:45,085
Great plan, let's do it

593
00:57:45,195 --> 00:57:47,595
I'll send out the invitations today

594
00:57:47,697 --> 00:57:51,565
You have thought of a good plan

595
00:57:53,837 --> 00:57:58,831
As long as the Jins can succeed
in their attack

596
00:57:58,942 --> 00:58:03,470
you and I will enjoy endless riches

597
00:58:03,913 --> 00:58:07,349
Han Shi Xiong, you are so sly

598
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:14,146
Let's do our parts, I'll leave now

599
00:58:14,257 --> 00:58:15,519
Farewell

600
00:58:33,076 --> 00:58:33,776
Lord Wu

601
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:38,143
Brother Ji Jiang, your visit is timely

602
00:58:38,248 --> 00:58:41,046
Stay at my place for a few more days

603
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:45,086
I guarantee I'll have good news
for chief Ba Shan

604
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:49,158
Lord Wu, wasn't that Han Shi Xiong?

605
00:58:49,259 --> 00:58:51,523
Yes, you know him?

606
00:58:51,628 --> 00:58:53,687
Of course

607
00:58:53,796 --> 00:58:56,230
Not only is he an old friend
of the family's

608
00:58:56,332 --> 00:59:00,632
my late parents were indebted to him

609
00:59:00,737 --> 00:59:05,470
What a good fortune we meet again

610
00:59:06,609 --> 00:59:09,442
It must be fate

611
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:12,344
so I could repay him

612
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:16,116
To show such gratitude

613
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:19,154
you are indeed a gentleman

614
00:59:19,255 --> 00:59:21,314
But perhaps there's something that
you don't know

615
00:59:21,424 --> 00:59:24,359
20 years ago Han Shi Xiong

616
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:27,054
was a well-known bandit

617
00:59:27,163 --> 00:59:29,791
He teamed up with Wei Tong Ming

618
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:33,198
and made his fame everywhere by

619
00:59:33,303 --> 00:59:35,897
using a flying dagger

620
00:59:37,674 --> 00:59:41,974
He has became our informant
in these 2 years

621
00:59:43,112 --> 00:59:45,774
I have heard you are shrewd and capable

622
00:59:45,882 --> 00:59:48,112
and I respect you a lot

623
00:59:48,217 --> 00:59:50,378
You're too kind

624
00:59:50,486 --> 00:59:52,078
I ought to make a move

625
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:04,028
Tong Ming, you're back?

626
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:09,504
Didn't you say you'd be back
10 days later?

627
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:11,233
I hung around the Shan Yang Province
for 2 days

628
01:00:11,341 --> 01:00:13,172
and as soon as I finished my affairs,
I returned

629
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:17,212
Lord Wu, who was that?

630
01:00:17,313 --> 01:00:18,974
I seem to have seen him somewhere before

631
01:00:19,082 --> 01:00:20,879
I just can't place him

632
01:00:21,484 --> 01:00:24,351
You're dumb, he is Yan Ji Jiang

633
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:26,979
What? He is Yan Ji Jiang?

634
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:28,853
Yes, you must be sick

635
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:31,392
not to recognise your old friend

636
01:00:31,494 --> 01:00:33,519
Of course I know Yan Ji Jiang

637
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:36,258
But I'm sure he isn't

638
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:42,632
Who is he? An impostor?

639
01:00:44,107 --> 01:00:47,372
Lord Wu, keep it low

640
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:50,071
so as not to alert him

641
01:00:51,347 --> 01:00:55,545
Let's play along with him

642
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:58,450
and see what his plans are

643
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,924
Spare some change, sir

644
01:01:19,709 --> 01:01:21,643
I want to see your Chief Qin Shang Yi

645
01:01:21,744 --> 01:01:23,871
do you know where he is?

646
01:01:25,948 --> 01:01:27,643
Go

647
01:02:01,851 --> 01:02:03,478
Waiter...

648
01:02:03,853 --> 01:02:07,311
Coming... what would you like?

649
01:02:07,690 --> 01:02:10,921
A chicken, meat, fish in vinegar

650
01:02:11,027 --> 01:02:15,657
a bowl of spicy soup and 50 dumplings

651
01:02:15,765 --> 01:02:18,427
Can you finish them?

652
01:02:19,035 --> 01:02:21,162
3 catties of wine too

653
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:26,706
A chicken, meat, fish in vinegar

654
01:02:26,809 --> 01:02:30,142
a bowl of spicy soup and 50 dumplings

655
01:02:43,826 --> 01:02:45,521
You didn't pay yet

656
01:02:45,628 --> 01:02:48,654
I don't have money

657
01:02:49,532 --> 01:02:51,830
Madam, something like that
just isn't done!

658
01:02:52,168 --> 01:02:52,868
What's the matter...

659
01:02:52,869 --> 01:02:54,632
She ate but refuses to pay

660
01:02:54,737 --> 01:02:55,437
What?

661
01:02:55,471 --> 01:02:57,029
She didn't pay for the meal

662
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:59,938
Don't you know who I am

663
01:03:00,042 --> 01:03:02,772
How dare you, you must be tired of living

664
01:03:02,879 --> 01:03:04,278
Please have pity on me

665
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:05,369
It won't happen again

666
01:03:05,481 --> 01:03:08,609
Not that easy, hey, beat her up

667
01:03:11,187 --> 01:03:12,415
Get up...

668
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:26,693
Again

669
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:30,034
Stop, have mercy on her

670
01:03:54,564 --> 01:03:56,532
Stop beating

671
01:03:57,533 --> 01:03:58,966
You all are beating up an old woman

672
01:03:59,068 --> 01:04:00,035
it's not a hero's deed

673
01:04:00,136 --> 01:04:02,263
If she can't pay, I'll pay for her

674
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:06,198
Is that enough?

675
01:04:07,944 --> 01:04:08,692
Yes...

676
01:04:08,727 --> 01:04:09,440
Take it

677
01:04:09,545 --> 01:04:12,571
Thank you... let her go...

678
01:04:14,083 --> 01:04:18,076
It's alright

679
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:26,057
Are you hurt?

680
01:04:26,562 --> 01:04:27,756
This old woman is so pitiful

681
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:29,798
We'll take her to Big Brother

682
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:26,850
I didn't expect it was you

683
01:05:26,956 --> 01:05:27,656
Otherwise how could

684
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:29,520
I find you

685
01:05:29,625 --> 01:05:31,718
Miss Fang, how clever you are

686
01:05:31,827 --> 01:05:33,192
It's no big deal

687
01:05:33,296 --> 01:05:35,423
but too bad we had to drag
the boss into this

688
01:05:35,531 --> 01:05:37,658
and cause him to lose some money

689
01:05:43,806 --> 01:05:46,866
You must have some urgent matters

690
01:05:46,976 --> 01:05:48,876
I've found out Wu Chang Sheng
conspired with Cai Yi

691
01:05:48,978 --> 01:05:51,105
On the pretext of celebrating birthday

692
01:05:51,213 --> 01:05:53,545
they'll lure Lord Xia to the feast

693
01:05:53,649 --> 01:05:54,809
Then they'll ambush him

694
01:05:54,917 --> 01:05:57,784
and kill all his men

695
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:00,221
Why don't you go to Da Kun Mountain

696
01:06:00,323 --> 01:06:02,018
and warn Lord Xia?

697
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:06,660
Cai Yi accused me of being a traitor

698
01:06:06,762 --> 01:06:08,787
How can I go to the Da Kun Mountain?

699
01:06:08,898 --> 01:06:10,593
Brother Qin, the reason
I looked for you today is

700
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:12,668
to request you to convey the message
to Lord Xia

701
01:06:12,768 --> 01:06:16,568
Alright, you go back first,
I'll go tonight

702
01:06:16,672 --> 01:06:19,402
I'll contact you tomorrow night, see you

703
01:06:26,415 --> 01:06:27,279
Come back

704
01:06:55,111 --> 01:06:58,274
You have your tricks, but I have mine

705
01:06:59,281 --> 01:07:03,240
Miss Fang, you have nowhere to run

706
01:07:05,054 --> 01:07:06,749
Catch her

707
01:07:07,957 --> 01:07:09,015
Wait

708
01:07:12,928 --> 01:07:13,986
Attack

709
01:08:20,696 --> 01:08:24,359
Thank you for coming, have a seat...

710
01:08:25,201 --> 01:08:28,068
Brother Chai, come...

711
01:08:28,170 --> 01:08:29,535
Congratulations...

712
01:08:29,638 --> 01:08:31,333
Have a seat...

713
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:45,447
Chief Cai, my greetings to you

714
01:08:45,554 --> 01:08:46,953
Have a seat please

715
01:08:49,592 --> 01:08:51,856
Many happy returns

716
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:54,259
Lord Wai, please

717
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:06,899
Lord Wai

718
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:13,207
Any instructions from Master Wu?

719
01:09:13,315 --> 01:09:14,339
Go as planned

720
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:17,078
I've also brought you good news

721
01:09:18,287 --> 01:09:21,188
Fang Ying Qi and Qin Shang Yi
have all been captured

722
01:09:21,290 --> 01:09:24,282
Tonight, you can carry out your plan
at ease

723
01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:27,056
Good

724
01:09:42,678 --> 01:09:46,045
Master, let me go, I'm innocent

725
01:09:46,148 --> 01:09:51,313
Stop shouting...

726
01:09:57,426 --> 01:10:01,692
Let go of me, damn

727
01:10:02,531 --> 01:10:03,793
Damn you

728
01:11:27,016 --> 01:11:30,452
Why isn't he here yet?
Could there be any plan change?

729
01:11:35,691 --> 01:11:36,658
Master

730
01:11:41,330 --> 01:11:44,094
Master, Lord Xia Zi Long arrives

731
01:11:44,199 --> 01:11:44,899
Invite him in

732
01:11:44,933 --> 01:11:45,831
Yes

733
01:11:48,671 --> 01:11:49,304
Lord Xia

734
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:50,863
Congratulations...

735
01:11:51,340 --> 01:11:54,309
It's your 50th birthday,
what a jolly celebration

736
01:11:54,410 --> 01:11:56,844
Thank you all for coming, please

737
01:12:12,661 --> 01:12:13,361
Master

738
01:12:13,362 --> 01:12:16,229
Tell them to launch the fireworks

739
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:17,390
Yes

740
01:12:54,803 --> 01:12:56,896
Attack

741
01:13:46,088 --> 01:13:48,579
"Longevity"

742
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:21,786
Oh, it's you

743
01:14:21,890 --> 01:14:26,589
Wei Tong Ming, twenty years ago

744
01:14:26,695 --> 01:14:29,027
you and Han Shi Xiong

745
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:31,599
killed my whole family, didn't you?

746
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:32,997
No...

747
01:14:33,101 --> 01:14:35,331
It was Han Shi Xiong who did it

748
01:14:35,437 --> 01:14:36,426
You traitor

749
01:14:36,538 --> 01:14:37,937
Even if I spared you

750
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:41,271
other people won't

751
01:14:41,376 --> 01:14:44,004
I'll cut you up into pieces

752
01:14:50,385 --> 01:14:51,511
Watch me

753
01:14:55,457 --> 01:14:58,051
It's beautiful

754
01:15:19,281 --> 01:15:21,579
Bravo...

755
01:15:24,653 --> 01:15:27,781
Lord, excuse me for a second

756
01:15:27,890 --> 01:15:28,686
Please

757
01:15:28,790 --> 01:15:30,280
Have a seat please

758
01:15:31,493 --> 01:15:32,892
Please

759
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:05,254
Master, Lord Wu Chang Sheng has

760
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:07,419
sent you a present

761
01:16:11,533 --> 01:16:13,967
Bastard, I don't know Wu Chang Sheng

762
01:16:14,069 --> 01:16:15,400
how come he has sent me a present?

763
01:16:15,504 --> 01:16:16,562
Get lost

764
01:16:16,672 --> 01:16:17,536
The present is here

765
01:16:17,639 --> 01:16:18,571
I don't want to look at it, throw it away

766
01:16:18,674 --> 01:16:19,307
Yes

767
01:16:19,308 --> 01:16:20,502
Wait

768
01:16:23,779 --> 01:16:25,269
Let me see

769
01:16:27,115 --> 01:16:28,946
A human head!

770
01:16:32,821 --> 01:16:35,585
What's going on?

771
01:16:37,492 --> 01:16:41,861
Lord Xia, he's the traitor

772
01:16:41,964 --> 01:16:45,422
Bull shit, who are you?
How dare you accuse me

773
01:16:45,534 --> 01:16:47,058
Come, grab her

774
01:16:47,169 --> 01:16:48,193
Yes

775
01:16:52,507 --> 01:16:54,202
Anyone who comes close will die

776
01:17:05,087 --> 01:17:07,180
Ying Qi, it's you

777
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:11,258
Cai Yi is just his alias

778
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:15,592
He's the renowned and wicked robber
Han Shi Xiong

779
01:17:19,101 --> 01:17:21,968
Conspiring with Wu Chang Sheng,
he used festivities

780
01:17:22,070 --> 01:17:23,833
to lure you to come

781
01:17:23,939 --> 01:17:26,499
and capture you all

782
01:17:26,608 --> 01:17:29,099
to obtain favour from Chief Ba Shan

783
01:17:29,478 --> 01:17:32,072
Lord Xia, you've almost fallen
into his trap

784
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:33,238
Bull shit

785
01:17:33,348 --> 01:17:36,715
What proof do you have for saying so?

786
01:17:45,127 --> 01:17:47,618
Wu Chang Sheng has brought his men
to offer help

787
01:17:47,729 --> 01:17:49,754
We've destroyed them all

788
01:17:50,132 --> 01:17:51,497
This head is the proof

789
01:17:54,903 --> 01:17:55,961
Han Shi Xiong, you are

790
01:17:56,071 --> 01:17:58,665
such a monster

791
01:17:58,774 --> 01:18:02,369
Traitors deserve to be killed, attack

792
01:18:09,017 --> 01:18:10,177
Master, catch the sword

793
01:18:15,757 --> 01:18:20,160
Han Shi Xiong,
today is your 50th birthday;

794
01:18:20,262 --> 01:18:22,355
and it's going to be the day you die

795
01:18:22,464 --> 01:18:23,328
Kill
