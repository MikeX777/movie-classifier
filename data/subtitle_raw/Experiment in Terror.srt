right, you're going to rob a bank.

Your case is no exception.

350
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:20,849
- I guess everybody does that.
- Yeah, I guess they do.

351
00:27:21,808 --> 00:27:23,977
Well, now about your problem.

352
00:27:25,353 --> 00:27:27,313
Yes.

353
00:27:27,397 --> 00:27:30,108
You know,
I... I just can't believe it.

354
00:27:30,191 --> 00:27:32,777
It's hard to adjust.
I can't think.

355
00:27:32,861 --> 00:27:36,447
Well, I'd be surprised
if you reacted any other way.

356
00:27:36,531 --> 00:27:39,159
You know, I didn't think
he'd do anything violent.

357
00:27:39,242 --> 00:27:40,994
I mean,
he scared the wits out of me.

358
00:27:41,077 --> 00:27:44,330
But for some reason, I didn't
believe he was completely serious.

359
00:27:44,455 --> 00:27:48,501
And then he comes in the house
and catches me phoning you.

360
00:27:48,585 --> 00:27:51,421
Now the first thing we need
is a description of this man.

361
00:27:53,756 --> 00:27:56,092
I don't know what he looks like.
I never saw him.

362
00:27:57,635 --> 00:27:59,637
That's going to make
things a little difficult.

363
00:27:59,721 --> 00:28:03,266
- But I'd certainly recognise his voice.
- Yeah, what else?

364
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,728
Well, there's something
wrong with his breathing.

365
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:08,521
What do you mean by that?

366
00:28:08,646 --> 00:28:10,023
Well, it...

367
00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:14,027
It sounded like, erm,
like asthmatic breathing.

368
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:17,363
My sister, Toby, had a kind of
mild asthmatic condition for about a year.

369
00:28:17,447 --> 00:28:22,160
And it sounded like that.
Sort of... laboured and wheezing.

370
00:28:22,577 --> 00:28:24,162
What did he say?

371
00:28:24,287 --> 00:28:27,790
That he wanted me to steal a hundred
thousand dollars from the bank.

372
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:32,962
And that if I didn't...

373
00:28:34,923 --> 00:28:36,799
he'd kill me and my sister.

374
00:28:37,842 --> 00:28:41,054
He said he'd killed twice before, and
he wouldn't hesitate to do it again.

375
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:44,015
He said that he's not
the only one watching me,

376
00:28:44,098 --> 00:28:46,559
that he would know my every move.

377
00:28:46,643 --> 00:28:48,228
And...

378
00:28:48,311 --> 00:28:50,313
And that...

379
00:28:50,813 --> 00:28:52,857
if I contacted the police...

380
00:28:58,363 --> 00:29:01,157
Did you drive your sister
to school this morning?

381
00:29:01,241 --> 00:29:02,242
Yes.

382
00:29:02,325 --> 00:29:03,117
Tell her about this?

383
00:29:03,243 --> 00:29:04,702
No, but...

384
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:12,252
You see, Toby and I are very close,
and she's a very intuitive young lady.

385
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:14,629
She guessed something was wrong,

386
00:29:14,712 --> 00:29:17,423
and I'm afraid I didn't manage
to carry it off very well.

387
00:29:17,548 --> 00:29:20,426
She knows it's serious, or it could be.
She doesn't know what it is.

388
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:21,886
But I promised I'd tell her tonight.

389
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:25,723
No. No, I don't think you'd better.
Suppose you let me tell her.

390
00:29:25,807 --> 00:29:27,850
Besides, I want to give her
some instructions.

391
00:29:29,018 --> 00:29:30,770
All right.

392
00:29:33,398 --> 00:29:37,151
Do... Do you think
that it's... it's possible he...

393
00:29:37,235 --> 00:29:38,945
that he knows you're involved?

394
00:29:40,863 --> 00:29:43,116
No, I doubt it.

395
00:29:43,199 --> 00:29:46,828
You see, we really can't tell
until he tries to contact you.

396
00:29:46,911 --> 00:29:50,290
If he does try to contact you,
then he doesn't know.

397
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:54,460
And if he doesn't contact me?

398
00:29:55,086 --> 00:29:56,879
You will be well protected.

399
00:30:04,137 --> 00:30:05,179
It's not gonna be easy.

400
00:30:05,513 --> 00:30:06,931
No, it's not.

401
00:30:07,432 --> 00:30:10,018
As a matter of fact,
it's going to get a lot tougher.

402
00:30:10,101 --> 00:30:11,936
He's going to work on you
and your sister

403
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:14,981
until you just may decide to go
along with him rather than us.

404
00:30:17,358 --> 00:30:19,402
Oh no. If I do this thing,
I'll do it all the way.

405
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:21,195
You don't have to worry
about anything like that.

406
00:30:21,321 --> 00:30:25,575
Fine. But just remember this.

407
00:30:25,658 --> 00:30:28,494
If he knows as much about you
as he obviously does,

408
00:30:28,578 --> 00:30:31,706
and he has a very definite plan,
he's probably very clever.

409
00:30:31,789 --> 00:30:35,793
And he knows it's going to take a
lot to make you steal $100,000.

410
00:30:35,918 --> 00:30:38,504
Now, he may institute
a reign of terror...

411
00:30:38,588 --> 00:30:41,090
that will make you agree
to do almost anything.

412
00:30:45,428 --> 00:30:47,138

Well, you know,
I'd like to say "no",

until we know the man.

You know, I really believe he knows
I've been talking to you.

682
00:53:07,519 --> 00:53:09,104
Nah, he's just guessing.

683
00:53:09,187 --> 00:53:11,481
He took a calculated risk
that you'd come to the police.

684
00:53:11,564 --> 00:53:14,609

you might panic and you might admit it.

- Yeah.

matters whether I'm right or wrong.

he's got a plan so clever

That's all right.
We understand.

867

- Then you do now him?
- Yes.

868
01:10:42,281 --> 01:10:45,325
Then perhaps you can tell us where
he lives, where we can find him.

869
01:10:45,409 --> 01:10:47,244
- I don't know.
- Lisa.

870
01:10:47,327 --> 01:10:50,122
I don't.
You'll just have to believe me.

871
01:10:50,205 --> 01:10:52,666
We dated a few times.
That's all.

872
01:10:52,750 --> 01:10:54,960
When was the last time
you saw him?

873
01:10:55,043 --> 01:10:56,754
A week ago Saturday.

874
01:10:58,505 --> 01:11:00,632
We had dinner
and went to a movie.

875
01:11:00,716 --> 01:11:02,050
You haven't heard
from him since?

876
01:11:02,342 --> 01:11:03,302
No.

Sometimes I don't
for a month or so.

878
01:11:05,763 --> 01:11:07,598
He's out of town a great deal.

879
01:11:09,725 --> 01:11:11,185
How did you first meet him?

880
01:11:11,477 --> 01:11:12,644
Where?

881
01:11:12,728 --> 01:11:14,772
It was at the drugstore.

882
01:11:14,855 --> 01:11:16,815
He used to come in,
and we'd talk.

883
01:11:16,899 --> 01:11:19,943
He seemed all right,
so I went out to dinner with him.

884
01:11:20,027 --> 01:11:21,945
That was about two years ago.

885
01:11:22,070 --> 01:11:24,490
You dated him only a
few times in two years?

886
01:11:25,783 --> 01:11:27,409
That's right.

01:11:27,493 --> 01:11:29,870

- No.

01:11:29,953 --> 01:11:33,332
- RIPLEY: He didn't even mention it?
- He never mentioned.

They showed the subject's photograph
to Nancy's Ashton's landlord.

907
01:12:45,904 --> 01:12:47,281
He recognised Lynch.

908
01:12:47,364 --> 01:12:49,992
Said he'd seen him visiting
Nancy Ashton on a couple of occasions.

909
01:12:50,075 --> 01:12:51,118
Did he say anything else?

910
01:12:51,201 --> 01:12:53,036
No, he only saw him,
never talked to him.

911
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:55,414
Didn't know who he was
until he saw the photograph.

912
01:12:56,957 --> 01:13:01,795
You know, judging from this guy's
women, he's quite an operator.

913
01:13:01,879 --> 01:13:03,130
Obviously, what has happened is

914
01:13:03,213 --> 01:13:05,090
he's involved Nancy Ashton
in the Sherwood case.

915
01:13:05,173 --> 01:13:07,342
She got frightened, and then
he killed her just like that.

916
01:13:07,426 --> 01:13:09,428
Besides, he probably knows
she tried to contact us.

917
01:13:09,511 --> 01:13:11,513
I'll make a bet Miss Soong
tells him we been around.

918

Stupid woman. How can she protect
a man like that? Will you tell me?

919
01:13:14,808 --> 01:13:17,227
Well, she could be scared.

920
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:20,272
You'll admit Mr. Lynch is a very capable
fellow when it comes to scaring people.

921
01:13:20,355 --> 01:13:22,316
All right, so she's scared.
There's more to it than that.

to do it again.

If she is in love with him,
she didn't know about him.

cooperation in this matter.

they'll see you get a promotion.

to say it, but I know very well

1061

he's going to keep me
until he examines that money.

1062

And if it's fake...

1063

he's not gonna let me go.
