1
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,960
- You two, come out.
- Stand up.

2
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,200
Come here. You too.

3
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:10,400
Hurry up. Come on.

4
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,800
You piece of scum!

5
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,720
What exactly have you done?

6
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,120
Sorry, sir.

7
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,040
We doubled the dosage this time.

8
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,440
I think he might have overdosed.

9
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,840
Please forgive us!

10
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,800
You are good for nothing.

11
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,760
To win this war,

12
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,080
we have to turn those captives
into our warriors.

13
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,600
The experiment has to be successful!

14
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,680
Yes!

15
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,376
During World War II,
the day before Japan's surrender,

16
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,200
Japan's biochemical laboratory
was destroyed by the British Army.

17
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,400
Since then,
it has been left buried underground...

18
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,400
Thunderbolt Circus

19
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,560
Ladies and gentlemen.

20
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,240
Tonight, the Thunderbolt Circus show

21
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,240
officially begins!

22
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,800
First, please welcome...

23
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,720
Goodness. I forgot.

24
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,120
Right.

25
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,520
First, please welcome our gorgeous Yao Li

26
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,360
and handsome He Jun

27
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:07,200
for their amazing
Nine-Section Whip performance!

28
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,800
Ladies and gentlemen.

29
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,240
Here comes
the most exciting part of the show.

30
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,520
He is the renowned King of Flying Daggers.

31
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,920
He is going to show you

32
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:01,640
his breathtaking flying dagger technique!

33
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,640
I suggest you don't blink.

34
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,320
Because his flying daggers are so fast

35
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,440
that they can hardly be seen.

36
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,480
Ladies and gentlemen,

37
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,160
please welcome

38
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,040
the King of Flying Daggers.

39
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,120
It's me, Twin-dagger Sunny.

40
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,960
Mr. Tak, Sunny is messing around again.

41
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,280
Ladies and gentlemen.

42
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,760
I'm the world-renowned, invincible,

43
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,520
and one and only master of flying daggers,

44
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,600
the descendant of Swordsman Li.

45
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,456
I'm the Merciless Flying Dagger
who never misses his target,

46
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,040
Twin-dagger Sunny.

47
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,520
Are you all very excited?

48
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,296
- We're in trouble. He's gone crazy again.
- Come on, let the show begin.

49
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,320
Hold this apple.

50
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,320
Don't worry.
I will pay you after the show.

51
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,200
Don't be scared, hold it.

52
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,736
Get a little bit closer. Don't panic.

53
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,760
You won't get hurt.

54
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,496
- I can't watch this.
- Ladies and gentlemen.

55
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,520
Call an ambulance.

56
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,040
Once the flying dagger is out,

57
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,760
no one can compare to it!

58
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,680
Great! Yes!

59
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,080
Cool!

60
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,160
Brilliant!

61
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,520
- Nice!
- Amazing!

62
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,400
Give me a chance.

63
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,560
Just once.

64
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,000
Stand over there.

65
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,680
What the heck!

66
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,680
You jerk! Are you creating trouble again?

67
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,440
You don't know what's good for you!

68
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,800
I'll pay you shortly.

69
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,400
This is ridiculous! All right!

70
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,120
Come on, show me how good you are!

71
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,200
You're in trouble. You're dead meat.

72
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,560
You really pissed me off.

73
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,520
I'll deal with you backstage.

74
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,440
Come on, go ahead!

75
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,800
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the real King of Flying Daggers,</i>

76
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,320
<i>Cheung Tai-chu!</i>

77
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,080
Excuse me. Move!

78
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,680
This is urgent!

79
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,240
Come, have a seat.

80
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,040
Don't be mad, I brought you two new girls.

81
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,240
Mr. Tak.

82
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,840
I really don't understand
why you have to keep this kid.

83
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,120
He's out of his mind.
He will get you into big trouble.

84
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,120
Besides, his dad died many years ago.

85
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,080
Thousand Flying Daggers?

86
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,320
Screw that!

87
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:32,120
Tai-chu, I wasn't pranking you.

88
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,410
I just wanted to perform
the flying daggers.

89
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:36,440
Silly kid.

90
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,320
If you fool around again, I'll kill you
with my daggers sooner or later.

91
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,640
Don't be mad. Enjoy yourselves.

92
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,560
- Just go and have fun.
- Let's go.

93
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,080
Enjoy!

94
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,080
Let me down.

95
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,480
I can't take it anymore.

96
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,170
I'll treat you to dinner.

97
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,410
Hey!

98
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,800
Why are you still standing there?

99
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,680
Chu hides a dagger behind his smile.

100
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,440
Stay away from him.

101
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,050
He'll kill you sooner or later.

102
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,240
Don't stay here.
You should go back to Hong Kong.

103
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,240
I'm not leaving.

104
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,680
I only want to perform the flying daggers,
but you never let me.

105
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,050
So I can only find a chance to try it.

106
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,680
Do you want to try it?
Do you want to learn it?

107
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,320
I watched you grow up.

108
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:34,290
How can I not know what you're capable of?

109
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,920
I keep telling you
that you have no talent for it.

110
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,240
Stop thinking
about the flying daggers, okay?

111
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,680
You screw up every time.

112
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,170
I've put up with that.

113
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,560
I continued letting you
work here as a clown.

114
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,000
If your late parents
didn't ask me to take care of you,

115
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,000
I would have kicked you out
a long time ago!

116
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,880
Please give me one more chance.

117
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,440
Stop it. It's out of the question.

118
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,410
I really can do it.

119
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,560
No way.

120
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,520
I really can do it.

121
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,880
I really can't do it.

122
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,480
- I can.
- What can you do?

123
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,640
You can't do anything!

124
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,266
You can't perform the flying daggers,
be a good man, or do any work.

125
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:12,000
You fail at everything!

126
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,120
<i>Feel with your heart.</i>

127
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,600
<i>Aim with your eyes.</i>

128
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,080
<i>Throw with your force.</i>

129
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:37,080
<i>Combine your force with the wind.</i>

130
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,720
<i>You have to befriend the wind.</i>

131
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,080
<i>Let the wind carry your flying dagger.</i>

132
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,280
<i>My son, you can surely do it.</i>

133
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,560
<i>Do I really lack the talent
to perform the flying dagger?</i>

134
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,040
Someone is digging for gold on that hill.
Let's check it out.

135
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,840
Really?

136
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,800
Yes, I'm not lying! Let's take a look!

137
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,920
- Hurry!
- Let's go!

138
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,520
Warning: Restricted military area

139
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,640
Warning: Restricted military area

140
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,240
Those three over there.

141
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,080
They were talking big at the bar.

142
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,760
They said they bought the treasure map
with all they had

143
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,880
and that the Japanese
left gold bars during the war.

144
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,200
We are going to be rich.

145
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,120
Honey, if we get the gold bars,

146
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,080
we can leave the circus for good.

147
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,240
Honey, I'll hire ten maids to serve you

148
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,776
and travel around the world with you.

149
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,176
Do you want ten maids to watch me
so that you can fool around?

150
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,600
Honey, how would I dare to do that?

151
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,840
What wouldn't you dare to do?

152
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,840
Hurry! We are never going to worry
about money anymore!

153
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,640
Don't panic.

154
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,680
Let's go inside.

155
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,160
How embarrassing!

156
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,960
I knew it was not steep enough here.

157
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,200
Good thing no one saw me.

158
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,360
It looks steeper over there.

159
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,080
I'll go and check that side.

160
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,160
Hey!

161
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,120
Tai-chu!

162
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,400
Are you all having a campfire party?

163
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,880
It must be very fun, right?

164
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,480
Did everyone get drunk so quickly?

165
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,680
I was practicing my backflip there.

166
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,240
I'm almost done. I already feel dizzy.

167
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,120
It seems like I can't see anything.

168
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,040
Since you followed us here,

169
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,400
this is our fate.

170
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,080
All right, I'll give you a chance.

171
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,040
Let's share the good times, okay?

172
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,880
Come on.

173
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,800
It's so dark in this big cave.

174
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:29,080
Could there be ghosts here?

175
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,840
A monster!

176
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,720
What monster? Those are just human bones.

177
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,680
Human bones?

178
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,640
Does a human have such a long spine?

179
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,680
Look at the skull,
it's as big as a rice cooker.

180
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,320
It has claws too.

181
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,360
Could it be that we've discovered aliens?

182
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,000
No matter what it is,

183
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,360
it's already dead.

184
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,840
That's obvious.

185
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,440
Come here.

186
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,840
Find out if there's anything ahead.

187
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,120
- Go.
- Is there a path ahead?

188
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,000
- I see it.
- Get going!

189
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,240
No way!

190
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,520
<i>Amitabha.</i>

191
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,280
Tai-chu.

192
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,960
It seems that many people died here.

193
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,120
Let's go.

194
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,000
Shut up!

195
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,920
Don't you ever shut up?

196
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,440
You'll die right here if you keep talking!

197
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,160
Do not open

198
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,200
Honey, what are these?
There are so many of them.

199
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,440
I don't know either.

200
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,200
Open it.

201
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,040
I told you to open it.

202
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,640
Goodness. I sprained my hand earlier.

203
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,960
I can't exert force. What should I do?

204
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,200
Kan, you're the strongest. You do it.

205
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,200
He told you to open it, do it!

206
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,616
Did you hear that?
There was a click, I've recovered.

207
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,850
It's okay now.

208
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,560
- It's okay? Are you sure?
- Yes.

209
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,240
- It's fine? Open it!
- Yes.

210
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,080
All right.

211
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:24,200
How can I open it?

212
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:34,720
God bless me.

213
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,850
Gold bars.

214
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,880
Honey, they are gold bars!

215
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,560
Really?

216
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:50,800
Am I dreaming?

217
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,280
It's true! They are really gold bars.

218
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,960
Tai-chu, we are rich!

219
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,160
Kan, take Sunny

220
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,320
to keep watch over there.

221
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,040
- Keep watch?
- Go!

222
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:15,440
We are really rich.
We can really travel around the world.

223
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,520
Check if there is more.

224
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,240
Kan, actually,

225
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,520
there is no one here.

226
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:25,610
Why should we keep watch?

227
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,400
- Honey.
- Honey, let's go!

228
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,680
Run!

229
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,640
My brother!

230
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,960
My brother!

231
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,760
My brother!

232
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,920
Tai-chu, run!

233
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,610
Fish Market

234
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:29,520
- Then...
- Okay.

235
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:15,080
What is wrong with you?
Didn't you know someone was on board?

236
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,920
Hey, look at him. He looks horrible.

237
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,480
It seems like he's sick.
Could it be contagious?

238
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,370
What should we do?

239
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,000
What should we do?
We can't let others know about our stuff.

240
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,370
Let's just throw him overboard!

241
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,960
<i>Life is just like a flying dagger,</i>

242
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,280
<i>you must have a target.</i>

243
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,000
<i>My son, focus on your target
and persevere in it.</i>

244
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,400
<i>Don't give up easily.</i>

245
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,360
What happened?

246
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,440
Help.

247
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,240
I'm starving.

248
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,560
Is anyone here?

249
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,200
Hey! Is anybody here?

250
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,960
Hey!

251
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,240
Is anyone here?

252
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,080
Is anybody here?

253
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,920
I'm starving.

254
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,520
I'm starving.

255
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,520
I'm starving.

256
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,720
Salted fish? This will do fine.

257
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,120
I'll eat it first.

258
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,720
It's delicious.

259
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,640
It's delicious.

260
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,080
Hey! What are you doing?

261
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:24,960
Are you stealing?

262
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,240
People, come and help! There's a thief!

263
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,720
Help! You fatso, don't go!

264
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,960
I'm not a thief. I'm just hungry!

265
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,280
I'm not a thief!

266
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,720
I'm not a thief. I'm just hungry!

267
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,000
I'm just hungry.

268
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,800
- Sorry.
- Fatso! Don't ever come back!

269
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,960
We'll beat you up
if we ever see you here again!

270
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,640
Please. Stop the car!

271
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,680
Please help me! Stop!

272
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:14,560
Sir, please. I have a flat tire.

273
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,080
Can you help me?

274
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,760
Okay.

275
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,160
Hey, did you jump into the sea?

276
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,000
No.

277
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,560
Did you get robbed then?

278
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,120
No.

279
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,520
So why are you alone and completely wet
so late at night?

280
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,160
I just went night swimming.

281
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,560
Night swimming?

282
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,200
With clothes on?

283
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,280
Do you have an identity card?

284
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,200
If you don't, I have to take you
to the police station.

285
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,360
No.

286
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,640
Don't report me to the police.

287
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,320
I have an identity card.

288
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,760
My name is Li Fei.

289
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,096
I'm the Merciless Flying Dagger
who never misses his target,

290
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,280
Twin-dagger Sunny.

291
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,696
Do you have such an exalted title?

292
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,720
Yes.

293
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,200
I'm from the Thunderbolt Circus.

294
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,560
I'm a flying dagger performer.

295
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,080
Should I take you to the hospital?

296
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,760
There is no need for that.

297
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,560
I don't understand
how I got so fat suddenly.

298
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,640
Perhaps you'd better take me home.

299
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,200
By the way, you are so nice.

300
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,720
What is your name?

301
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,200
My name is Angel.

302
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,280
The name really suits you.

303
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,000
Actually, I know you.

304
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,320
I've seen you on television.

305
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,520
<i>You are the muse of the news.</i>

306
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,880
<i>The cookies were delicious.</i>

307
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,920
<i>Thank you, Ms. Angel.</i>

308
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,200
Angel.

309
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,920
Actually...

310
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,120
Actually, I'm not this fat.

311
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,400
I'm quite slim.

312
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,480
The next time you jump into the sea,
no one will give you a ride anymore.

313
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,800
Thank you so much.

314
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,040
You're welcome.

315
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,080
Bye.

316
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,240
Bye.

317
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,760
Uncle Tak!

318
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,360
Uncle Tak!

319
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,120
Why aren't they back yet?

320
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,400
What is that?

321
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,120
It's a robbery!

322
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,880
<i>Good evening, everyone.</i>

323
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,880
Here are the news headlines,
I'm Angel Chan.

324
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,360
Around midnight yesterday,

325
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,000
an armored car was robbed
at Wang Tai Road in Kowloon Bay.

326
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,480
Over five million dollars were taken.

327
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,896
<i>On the same night,
at Wan Hoi St. in Hung Hom,</i>

328
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,000
<i>a jewelry factory was robbed as well.</i>

329
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,160
<i>Many gunshots were heard at the scene.</i>

330
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,696
<i>There were no gunshot wounds
on the injured police officer though.</i>

331
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,960
<i>It is suspected that
he was hit with a hard object.</i>

332
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,760
<i>For this jewelry shop robbery,</i>

333
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,896
<i>the criminals purportedly
didn't fire any shots at all.</i>

334
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:07,200
<i>Yet they managed to steal jewelry
with an estimated value of 30 million.</i>

335
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,736
<i>According to witnesses,
the robbers were three men and one woman</i>

336
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,336
<i>with terrifying and strange appearances.</i>

337
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,200
<i>This is similar to previous robbery cases.</i>

338
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,520
<i>For the sake of confidentiality,</i>

339
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,920
<i>the police refuse to divulge
further details to the public.</i>

340
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,960
This is already the eighth robbery case
within the week.

341
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:29,960
Strangely, in the crime scenes,
they found...

342
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:33,640
Non-human, bizarre palm print,
four robbers, incompetent police

343
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,400
- What weapons did they use?
- They had no weapons.

344
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,936
What happened
to this bulletproof glass then?

345
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,616
They said the security guard hit the wall
after a robber punched him.

346
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,680
Then the glass shattered.

347
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,360
Really?

348
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,040
Mr. Tong.

349
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,480
This is Mr. Yu Sam, a professor
from the Biochemical Research Center.

350
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,880
And the two people behind us are
the experts we hired from the Mainland,

351
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,520
Suen Ho and Ching Shau-wah.

352
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,280
They have arrested criminals
with supernatural powers before.

353
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,640
Just leave it up to them.

354
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,480
Suen Ho, we are counting on you.

355
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,640
Once the case is closed,

356
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,040
I will pay you double, okay?

357
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,760
What do you think?

358
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,400
These are more powerful than the last one.

359
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,560
So what?

360
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,600
Old Man, look at this diamond ring.

361
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,200
It's much bigger than what we ordered.

362
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,560
Take it then.

363
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,880
After all, they've been robbed.

364
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,760
The police wouldn't notice
if one more goes missing.

365
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,360
We are getting married in a month.

366
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,000
Do you want to marry me in jail?

367
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,000
I don't need a month. Give me 20 days.

368
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,720
I'll surely catch them.

369
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,240
I will marry you right after that.

370
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,000
Hello!

371
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,560
Why didn't you call me before coming here?

372
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,360
According to James's circular,
I'll be a paparazzi next week.

373
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,080
Why is that?

374
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,440
Mr. Lam lodged a complaint.

375
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:37,280
He said you defamed him
in your interview last time.

376
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,080
He sent us a legal letter.

377
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,720
The boss needs to find a scapegoat.

378
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,160
He is complaining after two years?

379
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,120
Come on.

380
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,480
Listen to me first.

381
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,920
Actually, you are already lucky
for not being fired.

382
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,080
We can't do anything
if these rich people want to mess around.

383
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,240
Right?

384
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,600
KK, don't lie to me.

385
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,160
Tell me the truth.

386
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,640
Do you want the truth?

387
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,720
Okay.

388
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,960
The company wants to use new talent,
so you should take a break.

389
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,640
That's it.

390
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,320
Use new talent?

391
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,240
YoYo?

392
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,800
Yes.

393
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,640
There's nothing I can do to help you.

394
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,200
It's strictly business.

395
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,720
You've been a newcomer once.

396
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:33,160
When you got promoted,
you kicked someone out too.

397
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,840
The company only prioritizes
the biggest returns.

398
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,480
She has only been working here
for two months.

399
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,720
Yes.

400
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,400
She's inexperienced.

401
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,840
She can't even speak clearly.

402
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,520
But...

403
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:54,000
Don't get mad if I'm frank, okay?

404
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:00,040
She's younger than you
and has a cuter smile.

405
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,290
Viewers like her better.

406
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:04,200
I'm very satisfied with that.

407
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,120
You are even more satisfied
with sleeping with her, right?

408
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:17,680
Even if that is true, so what?

409
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,290
Angel, you are outdated.

410
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,770
Actually, isn't it better
if you leave now?

411
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:27,250
At least some viewers will remember you
as the muse of CSS News.

412
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,600
Besides,

413
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:30,960
I also want you to know

414
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,680
that love

415
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,040
really can't be controlled sometimes.

416
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:41,640
First, I'm dumping you.

417
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:42,960
Second, I quit.

418
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,770
Don't ever come to me again.

419
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,800
Honey.

420
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,770
Why didn't you call me before coming here?

421
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,730
I surely won't let you look down on me.

422
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,120
So painful.

423
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,680
Uncle Tak!

424
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,040
Uncle Tak!

425
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,290
<i>Hello?</i>

426
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,920
Uncle Tak, this is Sunny.

427
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:15,360
I'm back in Hong Kong.
Why aren't you guys back here yet?

428
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,880
<i>You jerk, what did you do?</i>

429
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,730
<i>You guys are wanted
by the Malaysian police.</i>

430
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,200
<i>They detained all of our stuff.</i>

431
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:22,840
<i>I don't even have any spare underwear.</i>

432
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,120
I had nothing to do with that.

433
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,080
It was Tai-chu and his squad.

434
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,600
<i>I already told you
not to hang out with them.</i>

435
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,040
Uncle Tak.

436
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,560
I'm so scared.
I think something is wrong with me.

437
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,160
I'm so slim.

438
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:36,770
<i>You have always been slim.</i>

439
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,360
No, I was very fat last night.

440
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,000
<i>What the heck are you talking about?</i>

441
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:45,000
And I see a mosquito staring at me
and flying so slowly.

442
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,250
<i>Are you nuts?</i>

443
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,770
<i>Either go to the police station
or a mental hospital.</i>

444
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,560
No, the police will arrest me.

445
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,250
<i>Go. You didn't do anything.
Why should you be afraid?</i>

446
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,000
<i>Go to the police and get it settled.</i>

447
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:56,730
Okay.

448
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,600
Bye.

449
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,480
Do you want to bite me?

450
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,160
Why was that so easy?

451
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:33,120
Go!

452
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,480
It's very dangerous here, sir!

453
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,080
Go!

454
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,200
- Go!
- Me?

455
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,440
Stand over there first.

456
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,800
Sir, what's going on?

457
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,800
I want to report a case.

458
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,520
The station is in trouble.
Do you want to report a case?

459
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,920
Go somewhere else. Go.

460
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,400
There's a limit to my patience!

461
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,560
- You're going to be in trouble!
- Yes.

462
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,800
Someone is holding a policewoman hostage.

463
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:01,000
One, two. Two are down on the floor.

464
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:03,730
No way! How can you see that
from so far away?

465
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,920
I can see it very clearly.

466
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:08,000
<i>Sir, we can't shoot.
His gun is aimed at the hostage.</i>

467
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,680
<i>If we shoot him, the hostage is at risk.</i>

468
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:10,810
Do you want me to kill her?

469
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,320
<i>Snipers ready,
open fire when you have a chance.</i>

470
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,040
Useless police! Get out of here!

471
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,200
Get out!

472
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,960
What is going on?

473
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,320
Angel, something happened!

474
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,920
A criminal took an officer's gun
and is holding someone hostage.

475
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,120
- Who are you?
- We're from CSS News. Thank you.

476
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,040
- We are together.
- Okay, go in.

477
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,880
- Angel!
- Yes.

478
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,120
Don't you recognize me?

479
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:52,600
I'm Sunny Lee!

480
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,120
Sunny?

481
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,920
Twin-dagger Sunny!

482
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,320
I'm the fat guy from last night.

483
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:05,960
The very slim one.

484
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,520
Why isn't the car I want here yet?

485
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,770
Hey, stop bugging me. Someone is dead.

486
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:19,080
She's still alive. Don't worry.

487
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,360
That policewoman
seems to be out of breath.

488
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:25,920
You can see that?

489
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,456
That criminal is holding a gun
to the policewoman's head.

490
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,920
Her neck is strapped with tape.

491
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,200
She can't breathe.

492
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,000
She's dying.

493
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,770
- Freeze!
- Freeze!

494
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:04,770
<i>Who made the shot?</i>

495
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,400
<i>Sir, we didn't shoot.
It looks to be a bamboo stick.</i>

496
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,120
- What's your name, sir?
- Yes. Look here. Excuse me.

497
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:30,320
- Look here. Thank you. Right side.
- Excuse me.

498
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,640
Follow me!

499
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:33,080
- Excuse me!
- Excuse me!

500
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,800
- James, pass me the camera.
- Catch it!

501
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,800
Angel, go! I'll stop them. Come back soon!

502
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:40,730
Do you recognize me now?

503
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,520
Everyone recognizes you now.

504
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:46,360
Can you do me a favor?

505
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,800
Sure. What is it?

506
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,440
Please do an exclusive interview with me.

507
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,400
You have a rare genetic mutation.

508
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,800
Your cells divide so much faster
than an ordinary person's cells

509
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,920
and they keep changing.

510
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,040
Your cartilage tissues
keep proliferating too.

511
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,080
Stop this nonsense.

512
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,400
I just want to know

513
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,000
when I will go back to normal.

514
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,800
Tai-chu, you said

515
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,320
you and your friends
were infected with a biochemical toxin.

516
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:19,320
I think I have to know
the composition of the toxin

517
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,480
before I can answer you.

518
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,640
Actually, I don't know how to cure you.

519
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:23,840
Please let me go.

520
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,520
My wife and kids are waiting for me.

521
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,600
Please spare me.

522
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,250
Hey, come and have a look.

523
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,376
<i>A hostage situation occurred
at a police station this morning.</i>

524
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,080
<i>The hostage was already released
from the hospital after treatment.</i>

525
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,120
<i>The criminal suffered an arm injury</i>

526
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,800
<i>and is facing police charges.</i>

527
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:46,856
<i>The nameless hero captured on camera
rescued the hostage with a bamboo stick.</i>

528
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,480
<i>His identity has yet to be determined.</i>

529
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,960
I can't believe he is still alive.

530
00:41:56,770 --> 00:41:57,800
Tell me!

531
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,320
He was infected just like us.

532
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,400
But how is he doing just fine?

533
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,200
Why didn't his appearance change?

534
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:06,600
Different people

535
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,000
may react to the toxin in different ways.

536
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,480
Maybe he has certain defensive antibodies.

537
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,120
You killed my little brother.

538
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,770
Not only are you alive,

539
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,200
but your appearance didn't even change.

540
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,640
Spectacular Thunderbolt Circus

541
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,000
Hello, everybody. I'm Angel Chan.

542
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,730
In this period of frequent robberies,

543
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,250
a nameless hero
has finally stepped forward.

544
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:37,600
He used a bamboo stick
to resolve a hostage-taking incident

545
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,800
and rescued a policewoman's life.

546
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,440
He is now right next to me.

547
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,320
Let him introduce himself.

548
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,400
Hi.

549
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,680
Hello, everybody.

550
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,120
I'm Li Fei.

551
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,160
My English name is Sunny Lee.

552
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,480
My nickname is Twin-dagger Sunny.

553
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,800
Twin-dagger Sunny.

554
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,160
- Yes.
- Based on the nickname,

555
00:42:57,250 --> 00:43:00,160
it's obvious that what you did
didn't happen by chance.

556
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:02,880
Based on your skill
and the environment here,

557
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,560
is your job related to martial arts?

558
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,600
This place isn't related to martial arts.

559
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,290
This is the training area of a circus.

560
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,560
I travel with this circus

561
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,290
to perform all around the world.

562
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,480
Who taught you your flying dagger skill?

563
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,560
My dad taught me that.

564
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,280
My dad was the 26th descendent
of the Thousand Flying Daggers.

565
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,200
The Merciless Flying Dagger
who never misses his target.

566
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:35,080
Where is your dad now?

567
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,520
He has already passed away.

568
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,680
But it's okay.

569
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,560
As my dad told me,

570
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,640
"Life is like a flying dagger."

571
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,520
Once the flying dagger is released,

572
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,120
it must hit its target.

573
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,160
Why don't you show
your flying dagger skills to our viewers?

574
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,480
Act natural. Just think of it
as your performance on stage.

575
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:09,440
All right, I'll show you.

576
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:14,560
I'd like to see
your flying dagger skills too!

577
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,040
Tai-chu!

578
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:19,040
Angel?

579
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:34,440
Hello, Angel.

580
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,480
I'm a fan of yours.

581
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:38,280
Can we be friends?

582
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,240
Let me settle my affairs first.

583
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,400
Sunny.

584
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,040
Why do you look the same?

585
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,720
Tai-chu, you...

586
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,280
Your appearance didn't change much either.

587
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:02,720
You look quite handsome.

588
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,760
What medicine did you take?

589
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,680
I ate salted fish.

590
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,560
Some cookies.

591
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:12,440
I got fat. Then I became slim again.

592
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:13,920
I vomited and got diarrhea.

593
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,520
Then I was fine.

594
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,880
Isn't that amazing?

595
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:20,520
All right.

596
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,360
Be good

597
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,280
and come with me.

598
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,280
I'm not going with you.

599
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,520
Come with me!

600
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:32,920
- Hey!
- Go!

601
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:40,360
He's so fast.

602
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,000
Help!

603
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,080
Angel!

604
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,000
Angel!

605
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:01,480
Sunny.

606
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:06,160
I dreamed of my brother again last night.

607
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,240
He told me that he died miserably.

608
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,640
He slipped and fell to his death.

609
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:14,520
Tai-chu.

610
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,200
It was really not my fault.

611
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,720
I saw you kill my brother!

612
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:23,600
I think

613
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:27,240
God wouldn't be that unfair.

614
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,360
He granted us power

615
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,360
but turned us into freaks.

616
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,280
And he only favors you!

617
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:41,040
Old Man, they are evolving so fast.

618
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:43,520
They are already in phase two now.

619
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,160
So what?

620
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:47,320
Fortunately,

621
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:50,000
fate arranged for you

622
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:52,880
to make us perfect.

623
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,280
Your blood

624
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:58,120
will be our antidote.

625
00:47:58,360 --> 00:47:59,840
Tai-chu, don't act recklessly.

626
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,240
Are you going to drink my blood?

627
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:05,120
Let me tell you a secret concoction.

628
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:06,560
Listen.

629
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,280
Four taels of astragalus root.

630
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:12,600
Ten grams of Chinese yam.

631
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:16,240
Half a catty of each fritillaria.
Bellflower root and loquat.

632
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:18,840
If you like it sweet,
add two candied dates.

633
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:20,000
Fine, no candied dates.

634
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:21,920
The most important thing
is the cooking method!

635
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:46,840
Help!

636
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:22,080
You are still so incredible
even after getting anesthetized.

637
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:50,080
Old Man!

638
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,000
Hit his acupuncture point!

639
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:21,920
Cheung Tai-chu!

640
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,040
Don't force me!

641
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:45,880
Sunny.

642
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:47,840
Sunny!

643
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:03,280
Old Man.

644
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:06,720
I don't think Sunny is with them.

645
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:08,840
He is not a bad guy.

646
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:10,720
So what?

647
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:12,640
They are of the same kind anyway.

648
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,480
We must make him tell us
where the other freaks are.

649
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,840
Do slow-motion here.

650
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:28,240
Yes, okay.

651
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:30,280
Shoot until there.

652
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:33,240
- Yes, make an end shot here.
- Okay.

653
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:42,600
I'm making it clear to the public
that there are no mutants.

654
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:45,360
Please don't make any random guesses
to avoid public anxiety.

655
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:48,080
Then how do you explain
the pictures and clips that we took?

656
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:49,376
I repeat, there are no mutants.

657
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:50,976
We will do our best to get the suspects.

658
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,960
Are you capable of dealing with them?

659
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:55,800
Officer Hong, look.

660
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:01,160
Where did you get this?

661
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:09,120
Sunny's case is very peculiar.
I've never seen it before.

662
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,760
His blood contains
a strong biochemical toxin indeed,

663
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:14,040
but it didn't affect his cell tissues.

664
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:17,520
In fact, it made him many times
more powerful than ordinary people.

665
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:22,320
I think his own antibodies
neutralized the toxin.

666
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:24,960
I compared Sunny's preliminary report

667
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:27,760
with He Jun's, the suspect who got killed.

668
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:30,520
I found that there's no obvious mutation

669
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,360
in Sunny's muscle and joint tissues.

670
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:33,920
We can say

671
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:36,440
that he is a rare and extraordinary guy.

672
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:39,120
But Sunny is a mutant after all.

673
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,176
He poses a threat to the public
to a certain extent.

674
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,600
I suggest detaining him indefinitely
for further observation.

675
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:44,840
Until when?

676
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,440
That is not the solution.

677
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:48,120
He is in every headline now.

678
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,400
The public would think
that Sunny Lee is a hero

679
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:53,160
who punishes criminals and beats mutants.

680
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:56,400
How can we explain why a hero is detained?

681
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:00,080
Ms. Angel Chan
just proposed a good suggestion.

682
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:01,160
Listen to her first.

683
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:05,240
I think that
since we can't hide our hero Sunny,

684
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:06,816
why don't we follow the public opinion

685
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:08,800
and make him an embodiment of justice

686
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,160
or a savior?

687
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:13,280
Give him shows, ads, and endorsements.

688
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:15,000
I'm very experienced in media.

689
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:16,240
I can be his agent.

690
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:18,640
This would be advantageous

691
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:21,760
to the police, to Sunny,
and even in rebuilding the public's trust.

692
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:25,320
I think

693
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,400
it would be most advantageous to her.

694
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:29,560
I personally agree
with Ms. Chan's suggestion.

695
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:31,240
We must strike while the iron is hot.

696
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,680
That's why I already hired Ms. Chan
as a special consultant.

697
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:35,920
Sir, I think it's quite a good idea.

698
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:38,600
The experts we hire

699
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:41,880
cannot seem to help us
capture those mutants anyway.

700
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:43,600
From now on,

701
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:46,400
you two should just do your best
to assist and protect Sunny.

702
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,960
Who do you think you are
to give us orders?

703
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:50,400
Old Man.

704
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,080
Let's go. We quit.

705
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:53,160
Okay.

706
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,360
We'll do our best
to cooperate with your operation.

707
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:04,280
The merciless razor

708
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,040
will never miss its target!

709
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:08,640
It will root out

710
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,760
all its opponents!

711
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:23,200
The hairs are stuck.

712
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:24,600
Cut! One more time!

713
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:26,760
Mutant?

714
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Gosh!

715
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,400
As a superhero, I have to attend
networking parties so often.

716
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:42,560
I keep running around.
How can I have time to take a break?

717
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:45,040
Luckily, I have the Diarrhea Killer.

718
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:47,200
Without it, what should I do
if my stomach aches

719
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,160
while fighting mutants?

720
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:51,840
Diarrhea Killer, so cool!

721
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:53,280
Mutant.

722
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:54,680
Stop!

723
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,920
- Nice!
- How did I do? Is it okay?

724
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,040
You were great.

725
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:00,000
- I think so.
- But we are in a hurry, let's go.

726
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:01,640
Hold it first.

727
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:03,120
Hold it first.

728
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:11,560
- Sunny!
- Sunny!

729
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,080
{\an8}Twin-dagger Sunny, God's Favored One

730
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:16,800
- Sunny!
- Sunny!

731
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:19,280
Twin-dagger Sunny, Flying Dagger Hero

732
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:21,736
Crime-busting Ambassador,
Flying Dagger Hero, Twin-dagger Sunny

733
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,160
Twin-dagger nasal decongestant.

734
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:27,680
- Sugar, egg. Yes.
- Right.

735
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:29,240
After pouring in everything...

736
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:30,600
Yes, just stir it thoroughly.

737
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:31,960
That's incredible!

738
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:33,720
Twin-dagger Sunny,
Flying Dagger Hero Sunny

739
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:56,760
Wake up. You can do it! Go!

740
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:58,760
- Go!
- Go!

741
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:02,120
- Sunny!
- Nice!

742
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:12,440
Crime-busting Pioneer

743
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:16,360
Crime-busting Pioneer

744
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:26,440
Thank you.

745
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:28,400
What Sunny means is,

746
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:31,800
he will work harder and do his best
after getting this award.

747
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:34,840
He'll always be your Twin-dagger Sunny!

748
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,520
Old Man, inform Officer Tong.

749
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,480
They might be getting ready
to make a move.

750
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:11,600
There's no need.
I've been waiting for them.

751
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:15,320
You've been swallowing
your anger these days

752
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:17,000
because you want to use Sunny as bait?

753
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:18,560
You finally got it.

754
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:20,040
But...

755
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:21,600
Tai!

756
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:14,000
<i>You don't need to use
a flying dagger to kill pests.</i>

757
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:16,080
<i>Use Super Mutant Killer.</i>

758
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:19,560
<i>Just spray it all over, so fragrant.</i>

759
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:21,816
<i>All the pests and even mutants
will get killed instantly.</i>

760
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:23,280
<i>Super Mutant Killer.</i>

761
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:24,360
Kill!

762
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:35,360
<i>Hi!</i>

763
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:40,360
<i>Get the flying dagger, yo, yo, yo!</i>

764
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,000
This event was very successful.

765
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:47,280
It's so-so.

766
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:48,520
Do you want some wine?

767
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:50,960
I don't drink when I'm working.

768
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:53,400
So professional.

769
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:01,880
Are you used to living here?

770
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:09,040
Actually...

771
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:12,680
We are here to catch mutants
like Cheung Tai-chu.

772
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:17,600
But I realize that
turning into a monster on the outside

773
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:20,200
isn't the scariest thing.

774
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:22,800
What do you mean?

775
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:30,280
Sometimes, people can easily lose
their direction in life.

776
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:36,320
They'll even lose themselves.

777
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:40,640
While striving for fame and gain,
we unconsciously change.

778
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:57,520
It's so quiet, Old Man.

779
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:01,640
It hasn't been this peaceful
for a long time.

780
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:08,200
Haven't you always said
you wanted to buy a house by the sea

781
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:11,040
and live a peaceful life?

782
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:13,240
All right.

783
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:15,560
Let's buy one when we capture the mutants.

784
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:24,120
Do you remember what day it is tomorrow?

785
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:33,480
It's supposed to be our wedding date,
we missed it again.

786
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:40,600
Tai.

787
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:43,680
I'm really confident this time.

788
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,480
We have already found their weakness.

789
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:47,480
I believe we can finish this soon.

790
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:49,800
We have never dealt
with such tough mutants before.

791
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:51,840
Old Man.

792
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:54,080
Let's get some help.

793
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:55,160
Help?

794
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:57,600
Who can help us?

795
01:02:58,160 --> 01:02:59,200
Sunny.

796
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:01,200
They are all monsters anyway.

797
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:04,680
If we ask this little monster for help,

798
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:06,360
wouldn't it be much easier?

799
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:08,800
Don't you trust me anymore?

800
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:11,520
You think I can't handle this, right?

801
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:14,760
Old Man.

802
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:16,880
You know that's not what I meant.

803
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:20,760
Also, that day,

804
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:24,640
you placed Sunny
in a really dangerous situation.

805
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:27,400
You saw the mutant,
but you didn't inform the police.

806
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:30,000
Don't you think
you were too selfish to do that?

807
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:31,760
I'm selfish?

808
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:33,480
Consider me selfish then.

809
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:36,720
I won't feel at peace
until I am recognized for my success.

810
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:38,840
Even if we buy a house by the sea,

811
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:41,240
do you think
I would really feel happy and at peace?

812
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:07,360
Are you feeling exhausted?

813
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:10,280
Are you not feeling well?

814
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:12,560
Tell me.

815
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:17,040
Once the flying dagger is out,
no one can compare to it.

816
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:19,200
I can help you out.

817
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:28,320
Do you think I am a bad person?

818
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:30,240
No.

819
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:35,840
Don't you think I'm too selfish

820
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:38,720
to use you this way?

821
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:47,000
As long as you're happy, that's fine.

822
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:57,800
Angel.

823
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:02,360
You're the one

824
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:05,200
who made my dreams come true.

825
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:10,400
Just like my dad,

826
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:14,680
I can finally perform flying daggers
on stage.

827
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:23,160
No matter what,

828
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:26,960
I have to thank you.

829
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:36,560
Idiot.

830
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:54,680
Monster, don't move. All right.

831
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:55,760
Attack him!

832
01:05:58,160 --> 01:05:59,320
Okay. Monster, move a bit.

833
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:01,800
Together, look to the left.

834
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Yes.

835
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:04,520
Time to eat.

836
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:10,040
<i>After working the whole night,
these are so yummy.</i>

837
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:45,960
Flying-dagger hero?

838
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:48,640
I told you, I'll be back.

839
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:50,400
Without you,

840
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:52,920
my life is worthless.

841
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:53,920
Tai-chu.

842
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,840
My blood may not be able to save you.

843
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:58,160
You'd better surrender.

844
01:06:58,240 --> 01:06:59,240
I don't care!

845
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:04,320
I still want your blood.

846
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:06,976
<i>The number you dialed
cannot be reached at the moment.</i>

847
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,000
<i>Please try again later.</i>

848
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:11,520
Your life is mine!

849
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:12,960
Also,

850
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:16,640
Angel belongs to me too.

851
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:20,600
Do not hurt Angel!

852
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:22,880
You evil monster, you still don't get it!

853
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,240
Is there something wrong with your brain?

854
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:30,040
I won't let you off

855
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:31,720
until you die!

856
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:41,320
Come with me.

857
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:49,280
It's you again.

858
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:51,840
You are finally here.

859
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:56,000
All right.

860
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:58,880
Today, I'll offer your blood

861
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:01,000
as a sacrifice to my husband.

862
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:36,216
Your four major acupuncture points
in Qimen are now blocked.

863
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:37,240
Do you feel paralyzed?

864
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:39,490
Do you want to escape?

865
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:55,160
You are mine!

866
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:37,720
You can't escape!

867
01:09:43,490 --> 01:09:45,120
Open the door!

868
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:47,640
What? The studio is on fire!

869
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:49,570
- This is unbelievable!
- Open the door!

870
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:01,280
I heard voices inside.
I think someone is trapped inside!

871
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:02,570
Call the police!

872
01:10:03,490 --> 01:10:04,490
Go!

873
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:06,490
Hurry!

874
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:17,610
I will take you
as a contribution to science later.

875
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:19,320
You can't move anyway.

876
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:21,640
Just quietly wait
to become a mutant specimen.

877
01:11:17,490 --> 01:11:18,720
It didn't work.

878
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:22,680
Why?

879
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:27,570
Why?

880
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:54,240
I've waited for you for so long.

881
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,680
Old Man, run!

882
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:00,120
Tai, I'm going to fulfill my promise soon.

883
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:02,040
Our wedding date remains unchanged.

884
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:04,640
Old Man, you can't win against him.

885
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:06,040
Run!

886
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:07,570
Do you think I can't win?

887
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:11,320
I just dealt with one out there.

888
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:12,960
Look at him.

889
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:17,280
Tai, it's showtime.

890
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:19,800
Old Man!

891
01:12:34,570 --> 01:12:35,570
Stop!

892
01:12:42,530 --> 01:12:43,610
You're useless!

893
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:35,080
Old Man, run!

894
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:42,840
So you are still evolving.

895
01:14:25,610 --> 01:14:27,200
Tai, are you all right?

896
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:51,880
Is anyone hurt?

897
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,400
What in the world?

898
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:49,490
I didn't expect
the monster to evolve so quickly.

899
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:52,120
Silver needles and acupuncture points
didn't work!

900
01:15:53,610 --> 01:15:54,960
Good thing I killed one

901
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:57,040
or they would assume
that I'm easy to deal with.

902
01:15:58,640 --> 01:15:59,920
Tai.

903
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:02,530
Let's use a steel mill instead
and double the anesthetics.

904
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:04,840
We'll definitely get that monster
next time.

905
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:10,720
Tai!

906
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:17,680
Shau-wah...

907
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:19,320
Shau-wah.

908
01:16:20,570 --> 01:16:21,720
Don't joke around with me.

909
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,000
This is not funny.

910
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:28,040
I'm not going to play along!

911
01:16:30,530 --> 01:16:31,530
Old Man.

912
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:35,570
I like that you call me Tai.

913
01:16:37,530 --> 01:16:39,610
You gave me this name.

914
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:45,320
Tai.

915
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:48,800
Be good.

916
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:52,360
You will be fine.

917
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:55,400
Don't sleep.

918
01:16:57,200 --> 01:16:59,530
We are going to the hospital now
and you will be fine.

919
01:17:02,490 --> 01:17:03,720
There's no need.

920
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,160
Old Man.

921
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:10,160
Sorry.

922
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:17,610
Carry on by yourself in the future.

923
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:21,360
Don't say that.

924
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:22,800
I don't want that.

925
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:25,320
Without you,

926
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:28,160
how could I carry on?

927
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:30,280
Don't leave me.

928
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:35,720
Old Man.

929
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:40,840
Remember.

930
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:47,640
No matter what happens,
don't lose yourself.

931
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:50,570
Old Man.

932
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:53,200
Tai.

933
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:57,360
It's okay. Don't be afraid.

934
01:17:58,570 --> 01:18:02,490
No matter where you are,
I will always be with you.

935
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:06,080
I will always be with you.

936
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:08,320
You will never get lost.

937
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Old Man.

938
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:20,640
It's so beautiful here.

939
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:23,640
So peaceful.

940
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:38,360
Tai!

941
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:40,800
Tai!

942
01:18:42,490 --> 01:18:43,530
Tai!

943
01:18:45,530 --> 01:18:48,040
I was wrong. Come back.

944
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:50,610
Come back, okay?

945
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:57,640
I won't fight them anymore.

946
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:45,920
Thank you for saving me.

947
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:55,040
Just like you,

948
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,360
I was befuddled for half my life.

949
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:07,960
From now on,
this is none of my business anymore.

950
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:13,200
The right things, the wrong things,

951
01:21:15,610 --> 01:21:17,000
I have done them all.

952
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:23,080
It's time to leave.

953
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:27,280
I have been the people's hero

954
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:30,160
for a period of time.

955
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:32,320
Being the Twin-dagger Hero

956
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:35,530
changed my life.

957
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:39,040
I thought that it could bring me
happiness and success.

958
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:42,200
But actually, I have been lying to myself.

959
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:46,720
You would even risk your life

960
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:48,570
to achieve recognition in the past.

961
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:51,570
How can you give up so easily now?

962
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:55,640
Suen Ho,

963
01:21:56,240 --> 01:21:57,440
please help me.

964
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:04,000
Tai once said

965
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:13,280
a little monster like you
would be able to tackle them.

966
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:18,000
Let me teach you
how to control your power.

967
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:25,080
This was Tai's last request

968
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:28,490
from me.

969
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:38,440
<i>You imbibed too much poisonous gas,
and luckily, excreted all of them.</i>

970
01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:40,490
<i>You can only be considered a half-mutant.</i>

971
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:43,680
<i>You can only use your power
when you are in danger.</i>

972
01:22:44,530 --> 01:22:46,200
<i>But you can't control it.</i>

973
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:48,520
<i>And you can't throw
flying daggers accurately.</i>

974
01:22:49,490 --> 01:22:51,400
<i>I'm now going to train you</i>

975
01:22:52,570 --> 01:22:53,960
<i>to improve your concentration.</i>

976
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:56,760
<i>Don't think of anything else,
other than your target.</i>

977
01:22:57,240 --> 01:22:59,570
<i>I will tell you
about Cheung Tai-chu's weakness.</i>

978
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:38,960
<i>News headlines.</i>

979
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:41,360
<i>The series of mutant attacks
has caused heavy casualties.</i>

980
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:43,736
<i>Experts have yet to come up
with a way to deal with mutants.</i>

981
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:47,240
<i>The mutants kidnapped six scientists
studying biochemical toxins.</i>

982
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:48,616
<i>This series of murders and arsons</i>

983
01:23:48,640 --> 01:23:51,880
<i>have caused panic,
resulting in a citywide evacuation.</i>

984
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:32,530
Ms. Chan, you better take a rest.

985
01:24:32,610 --> 01:24:34,610
You haven't slept for two days.

986
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:37,160
If we have any news about Sunny,
we'll definitely let you know.

987
01:24:54,490 --> 01:24:55,840
Can you help me?

988
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:00,490
My name is Angel.

989
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,400
- Angel!
- Yes.

990
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:25,800
Wake up. You can do it! Go!

991
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:27,760
- Go!
- Go!

992
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:04,760
Hello? Sunny?

993
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:06,490
<i>Angel.</i>

994
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:09,080
<i>It's me.</i>

995
01:26:09,610 --> 01:26:11,120
<i>Cheung Tai-chu.</i>

996
01:26:12,490 --> 01:26:14,760
I sent Sunny to heaven,

997
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:17,200
but I am in hell.

998
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:19,160
<i>Angel.</i>

999
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:22,000
<i>Where are you?</i>

1000
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:24,680
<i>I am so lonely.</i>

1001
01:26:25,960 --> 01:26:27,530
I just realized

1002
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:33,640
that what God gave me isn't power,

1003
01:26:34,530 --> 01:26:36,490
but a form of punishment.

1004
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:40,200
I am becoming more and more powerful,

1005
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:44,040
but I have never felt lonelier.

1006
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:47,610
You deserve the worst punishment!

1007
01:26:53,530 --> 01:26:54,530
Angel.

1008
01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:01,680
You are the only one I want to see now.

1009
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:03,920
<i>Stop hiding.</i>

1010
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:06,800
<i>No matter where you are, I will find you.</i>

1011
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:32,200
We have to remind you

1012
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:34,960
that what you want to do
is very dangerous.

1013
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:38,080
Even if you can lure Cheung Tai-chu out,

1014
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:39,800
we can't guarantee that we can catch him.

1015
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:43,920
I have already decided.

1016
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:48,800
<i>Forget that I haven't found
a treatment method.</i>

1017
01:27:49,160 --> 01:27:51,120
<i>Even if I did,</i>

1018
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:52,960
<i>I won't help you!</i>

1019
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:56,560
God gave you power,

1020
01:27:57,040 --> 01:28:00,280
but your vicious mind is from yourself!

1021
01:28:01,080 --> 01:28:02,720
There is no cure for it.

1022
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:04,920
Just wait for your demise!

1023
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:25,640
<i>Angel, if you still don't come out,</i>

1024
01:28:25,720 --> 01:28:27,560
<i>I will kill so many people.</i>

1025
01:28:27,720 --> 01:28:29,080
You don't have to find me anymore.

1026
01:28:30,760 --> 01:28:32,160
I have finally figured it out.

1027
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:35,960
Actually, you and I are both bad.

1028
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:38,160
We are the same type of person.

1029
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:40,040
I am lonely too.

1030
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:44,320
Tomorrow is my birthday.

1031
01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:46,720
<i>Kowloon Bay Building, 131.</i>

1032
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:05,040
<i>Bravo One, clear.</i>

1033
01:29:05,480 --> 01:29:06,480
<i>Roger out.</i>

1034
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:09,200
<i>Bravo Two, clear.</i>

1035
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:11,400
<i>Roger out.</i>

1036
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:17,280
<i>Command Center,
there's nothing suspicious here.</i>

1037
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:18,360
<i>Monitoring continued.</i>

1038
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:19,960
<i>Roger out.</i>

1039
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,320
<i>Snipers, keep a close watch.</i>

1040
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:25,680
<i>Once the target appears, kill him.</i>

1041
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:27,200
<i>Roger.</i>

1042
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:49,480
<i>The target is here! Watch out!</i>

1043
01:29:54,280 --> 01:29:56,000
<i>The target is going down!
Brave Two, follow!</i>

1044
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:57,440
<i>He's too fast, I can't shoot him!</i>

1045
01:29:57,920 --> 01:30:00,040
<i>Attention, all teams.
Take strict containment!</i>

1046
01:30:00,120 --> 01:30:01,400
<i>Brave One, roger out.</i>

1047
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:02,760
<i>Brave Two, roger out.</i>

1048
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:12,320
<i>Ms. Angel, the mutant is coming down.</i>

1049
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:13,920
<i>Leave through the backdoor as planned.</i>

1050
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:16,760
<i>Ms. Angel, it will be very dangerous
if you stay.</i>

1051
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:17,720
<i>We can't protect you.</i>

1052
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:18,800
<i>Take her away!</i>

1053
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:20,600
Ms. Angel, let's go!

1054
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:28,536
<i>Bravo Two, our line of sight is blocked.
Our comrade might be behind the door.</i>

1055
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:29,600
<i>All units, hold your fire!</i>

1056
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:43,720
Angel.

1057
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:47,960
Happy birthday.

1058
01:30:53,960 --> 01:30:55,360
Cheer up.

1059
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:58,120
From now on,

1060
01:30:58,920 --> 01:31:02,520
we will be friends forever.

1061
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:08,200
Actually, I would prefer
that we be lovers.

1062
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:12,000
And we will be together forever.

1063
01:31:17,160 --> 01:31:18,160
Lovers?

1064
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:20,040
Why do you love me so much?

1065
01:31:22,120 --> 01:31:24,160
Whenever I think about you,

1066
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:28,720
I feel very happy.

1067
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:32,360
Do you know what love is?

1068
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:37,720
It's a kind of feeling.

1069
01:31:38,840 --> 01:31:41,360
Your minds are in sync,
you miss each other,

1070
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:46,320
you laugh and cry together,
and he is the only one in your heart.

1071
01:31:47,640 --> 01:31:49,000
That is love.

1072
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:56,040
You are just a pitiful person.

1073
01:31:57,920 --> 01:31:58,920
I don't care!

1074
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:01,840
Come with me.

1075
01:32:04,440 --> 01:32:06,640
I will give you whatever you want.

1076
01:32:08,280 --> 01:32:09,680
I want you to die!

1077
01:32:14,160 --> 01:32:15,160
It's useless!

1078
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:16,400
Come with me!

1079
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:20,280
<i>Hold your fire!</i>

1080
01:32:20,360 --> 01:32:23,120
<i>Angel just pushed Cheung Tai-chu
out the window. We can't take aim!</i>

1081
01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:34,720
Angel.

1082
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:41,400
Sunny.

1083
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:49,320
Sunny, you're not dead?

1084
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,080
Stop this!

1085
01:32:56,040 --> 01:32:57,760
<i>Hold your fire!
It's the Flying-dagger Hero!</i>

1086
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:02,880
Sunny!

1087
01:33:06,280 --> 01:33:07,280
What was that?

1088
01:33:30,360 --> 01:33:31,600
Let me deal with you!

1089
01:34:28,120 --> 01:34:30,240
Tai is waiting for you in the Netherworld.

1090
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:32,400
Go and accompany her.

1091
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:07,040
Angel!

1092
01:36:52,360 --> 01:36:53,400
Angel!

1093
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:01,080
Sunny!

1094
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:52,920
It's okay.

1095
01:37:53,560 --> 01:37:57,160
After I kill that idiot, you will be mine.

1096
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:11,800
Sunny.

1097
01:38:13,240 --> 01:38:16,360
I feel strange seeing you alive.

1098
01:38:16,440 --> 01:38:19,240
It seems like I feel less lonely.

1099
01:38:22,040 --> 01:38:24,880
But you came back to die.

1100
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:26,960
Even if you can't change how you look,

1101
01:38:28,760 --> 01:38:29,960
you can change your ways.

1102
01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:32,960
Stop this.

1103
01:38:33,040 --> 01:38:34,320
I don't want to be human!

1104
01:38:35,120 --> 01:38:36,640
I want to be God!

1105
01:38:37,720 --> 01:38:39,200
He gave me power,

1106
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:41,760
so I can have everything I want,

1107
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:43,120
including love.

1108
01:38:45,320 --> 01:38:46,320
You're so pathetic.

1109
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:47,920
Shut up.

1110
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:51,720
You can't even save yourself.

1111
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:53,520
How can you be the Flying-dagger Hero?

1112
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:56,840
Come on.

1113
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,120
Release your flying daggers!

1114
01:39:30,600 --> 01:39:31,680
Help!

1115
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:35,720
- Help!
- Help!

1116
01:39:46,680 --> 01:39:48,280
I can't open it!

1117
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:13,000
Angel!

1118
01:40:14,200 --> 01:40:15,200
Angel.

1119
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:18,400
Go!

1120
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:26,320
Why?

1121
01:40:27,120 --> 01:40:28,720
Why?

1122
01:40:30,160 --> 01:40:34,000
You laughed and cried together.

1123
01:40:36,160 --> 01:40:39,360
You even sacrificed your life for him.

1124
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:42,680
Angel.

1125
01:40:47,320 --> 01:40:48,400
Angel!

1126
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:51,520
I can't believe this.

1127
01:41:03,200 --> 01:41:05,120
I can't believe this.

1128
01:42:12,120 --> 01:42:13,320
Angel.

1129
01:42:17,640 --> 01:42:18,640
Angel.

1130
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:08,640
If you still won't take me
to the hospital,

1131
01:43:08,720 --> 01:43:10,440
I will really die.

1132
01:43:49,360 --> 01:43:50,760
Feel with your heart.

1133
01:43:51,280 --> 01:43:52,920
Aim with your eyes.

1134
01:43:53,400 --> 01:43:55,000
Throw with your force.

1135
01:43:55,840 --> 01:43:57,720
Combine your force with the wind.

1136
01:43:57,880 --> 01:43:59,840
You have to befriend the wind.

1137
01:44:00,040 --> 01:44:02,120
Let the wind carry your flying dagger.

1138
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:04,720
My son, you surely can do it.

1139
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:06,680
- Fly!
- Fly!

1140
01:44:08,840 --> 01:44:10,680
- That was so close, my son!
- Gosh!

1141
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:12,680
<i>My son.</i>

1142
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:17,560
<i>Do you know? You're the 28th descendant
of Thousand Flying Daggers.</i>

1143
01:44:17,640 --> 01:44:19,320
<i>You can't fail.</i>

1144
01:44:19,400 --> 01:44:21,160
<i>You must hit it, understand?</i>

1145
01:44:21,280 --> 01:44:23,840
<i>Listen, life is like a flying dagger.</i>

1146
01:44:23,920 --> 01:44:26,136
<i>Once the flying dagger is released,
it must hit its target.</i>

1147
01:44:26,160 --> 01:44:30,360
<i>Dear, if you are the target,
he might hit it accurately.</i>

1148
01:44:30,440 --> 01:44:31,600
<i>In that case,</i>

1149
01:44:31,720 --> 01:44:34,560
<i>if my sacrifice can make him good at this,</i>

1150
01:44:34,840 --> 01:44:36,360
<i>I'm willing to do it!</i>
