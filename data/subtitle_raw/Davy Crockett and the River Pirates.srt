- oh!

684
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:37,200
- give 'em what for, davy.

685
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,160
- [Laughing]

686
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,880
- use that pole, man!

687
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,440
Hit 'em! Hit 'em!

688
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:17,040
Uh...uh!

689
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,560
[Laughter]

690
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,960
- hey! You thought you was
gonna wear our pelts!

691
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,760
You thought we was
gonna be trailin'!

692
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,120
- what's the world gonna say?

693
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:59,320
Mike fink, king of the river,

694
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,360
losin' to a pack
of landlubbers.

695
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,440
- I don't reckon we want
anything but our furs.

696
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,360
That's all we started out
to do.

697
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:09,040
- you mean, you ain't gonna
lay claim to my red feather?

698
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,960
- there's only one king
of the river, mike.

699
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,440
- yeah, that there bayou
we just come through

700
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:17,040

What do you think this is,
a free trip?

716
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,800
- why, you ungrateful polecat,

717
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,440
we shove and dragged
this old tub of yours

718
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,240
all the way up
from new orleans.

719
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,360
- I gotta admit, for a couple
backwoods bear hunters,

720
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,680
you ain't done bad.

721
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:22,360
- those are mighty kind words
coming from you, mike.

722
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:26,280
You can put us ashore
any place along here.

723
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,360
- I can't see why you
bristle-headed varmints

724
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,360
can't land at a settlement
like civilized passengers.

725
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,200
- how do you like that?

726
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,160
He works the tar out of us,
then he calls us "passengers."

727
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,760
- it's the quickest way
to get home.

728
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,400
- sounds like
a mighty long walk to me.

729
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,280
- who's walkin'?

730
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,320
We're gonna get some horses
and sit down for a change.

731
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,200
- now, where are you gonna
find horses

732
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,280
in a lonesome place like this?

733
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,880
- chickasaws.

734
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,880
This is their country,
and they're real friendly.

735
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,960
Been a real pleasure
knowing you, mike.

736
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:15,080
- I ain't likely to forget you
two, neither.

737
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,760
Hey, you forgot your sack!
[Thud]

738
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,920
- oh, that's yours.
- mine?

739
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,320
- just a little something
to remember us by.

740
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,920
Open it up.

741
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:33,800
- well, ain't she a pretty
little pop gun?

742
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:36,840
"To mike fink,
king of the river,

743
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:42,040
from his admirers,
davy crockett and g. Russel."

744
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,200
- oh, now that we're leavin',

745
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,040
we figured you needed
something to protect you

746
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:47,280
against them
redskin pirates upriver.

747
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,920
- don't reckon
I'll need her for that.

748
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,800
But she'll sure
come in mighty handy

749
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,440
for letting tavern
keepers know
mike fink's a-comin'.

750
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:56,120
- there's something else
in that sack for you.

751
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,400
- uhh.

752
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:04,240
- aw. You shouldn't
have done it.

753
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:06,280
- georgie and me didn't want
nobody thinkin'

754
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:07,960
you still wasn't king.

755
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,960
- never was no danger of that.

756
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,440
You bushwhackers
ever get a hankering

757
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,840
to be river men again,
look me up.

758
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,320

765
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,000

they was taking us.

798
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,840
- yeah, but what are they
going to do with us?

799
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:15,440
- you've seen red hornet
stirred up before.

800
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:19,040
Shouldn't be too
hard to guess.

801
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:25,040
Mind your manners, georgie.
This is the chief.

802
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,320
- I am told you are the hunter
white men call davy crockett.

803
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:32,960
- he sure is, chief.

804
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:35,440
- you are known to us
as friend of the red man.

805
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,920
- we both are,
and look how
you're treating us.

806
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,240
- you and your friend
will not be harmed,

807
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:42,120
but you will remain prisoner.

808
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:43,440
- why are your men
in war paint?

- we go to avenge the murder
of our brothers.

810
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,920
This messenger has come from
the chief of the kaskaskias.

811
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,840
White men have been killing
his people without reason,

812
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,760
hunting them down
like animals.

813
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:55,240
- kaskaskias?

814
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,440
They're up on the Ohio
around cave-in rock.

815
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,240
- well, no wonder folks
been shootin' at 'em.

816
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,400
They've been attacking
every boat comes
down the river.

817
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:02,760
- do you understand
what they say?

818
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:06,080
- [Spits] They are white.
They hear only
white man's lies.

819
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:07,920
- now, listen here, you.
This ain't something we heard.

820
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,360
We seen it, didn't we, davy?

821
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:11,280
- sure did.
- when was this?

822
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,960
- not more than
three months ago.

823
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,480
- yeah, we helped break up
a raid on a boat

824
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,320
just below the big cave.
- more lies.

825
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,120
Three moons ago my people
were hiding far
from the river,

826
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:20,440
driven there by the white men.

827
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,280
- then it must have been
some other tribe.

828
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:25,120
- there are no other red men
in the land of the kaskaskias.

829
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:28,440
We have always kept the peace.
- I believe you.

830
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:30,240
Georgie, you know what
this means?

831
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:31,760
- well, it could mean
some white skunks

832
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:33,080
are dressing up like indians

833
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:34,840
so these poor devils
get the blame.

834
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:37,280
- we're going to find out
who they are.

835
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:39,240
You say you know me.

836
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,040
Then you know
davy crockett's word is good.

837
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,280
Turn us loose,

838
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,280
and we'll chase those varmints
out into the open.

839
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:45,440
- and if they ain't indians,

840
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:47,480
we'll see to it
everybody finds out about it.

841
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,960
- it is too late.

842
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:52,360
Already more messengers
have gone to the shawnee...

843
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:54,880
The Miami, the kickapoo.
And the chippewa.

844
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,800
- then call them back.
Send out runners of your own.

845
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:59,320
Tell the chiefs
to keep the peace.

846
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:01,360
- know this, davy crockett.

847
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,480
We have always wanted peace
with the white man.

848
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,080
But he does not want peace
with us.

849
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,080
He makes treaties
and calls us brother.

850
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:09,840
But he believes any evil
he hears of us.

851
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:12,080
- that's right.

852
