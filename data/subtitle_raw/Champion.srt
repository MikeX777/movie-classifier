1
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:46,661
Deuk Gu Kim, managed by Hyun Chi Kim
who was a world class fighter in his time,

2
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,241
and trained by yet another Kim Yoon Gu.

3
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:54,244
I'm told by Irving Rada
top rank promotions director.

4
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:56,439
Not all of the Kim's are not the same Kim's.

5
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:58,779
In fact, Kim is a very
common name in Korea.

6
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:02,948
I will tell you something, this particular
Kim looks to be in great shape.

7
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:06,388
I agree. He's ready to fight
Here in Las Vegas.

8
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:12,027
There is the Champion, Boom Boom Mancini!

9
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:15,033
Making his way into the Coly outdoor ring.

10
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:19,199
The noise in this arena seems
to be is getting louder and louder,

11
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:21,797
as the audience anticipates
the boxers' entrance.

12
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:24,674
Deuk Gu Kim is not intimidated by Mancini.

13
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,909
He has very good punch to counterattack.

14
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:31,976
Kim also has a great
reputation of good combinations.

15
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,845
Good Afternoon, Ladies and Gentlemen.

16
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:37,990
Today's main event.

17
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:46,965
Top rank and Round one
It's a 15 round match for the WBA world title.

18
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:53,799
In the blue corner, weighing in at 
134.75 lbs, from Seoul,

19
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:59,209
South Korea & ranked number one
in the world WBA. Deuk Gu Kim!!

20
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:11,291
And in the red corner, weighing at 
134.25 lbs, from Youngstown, Ohio

21
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:18,754
and currently the world WBA champion
Ray Boom Boom Mancini!

22
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:23,830
Ray Boom Boom Mancini's father
Lenny Mancini attended at Ringside today.

23
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:27,268
I'm sure he's very proud of his son,
the world Champion.

24
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:32,276
We'll be here to witness as he defends
his title against a very strong opponent.

25
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:35,814
Okay, gentlemen
no blows below the waist.

26
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,449
If I pull on you,
I want you to pull back.

27
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:42,422
If either of you gets knocked down on the canvas
three times in a row, the fight is over.

28
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:44,014
Now the best of luck to both of you.

29
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:47,116
These two fighters have
very similar physical stats.

30
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:52,427
Both 5 feet 6 inches tall.
Each weighting 134 pounds.

31
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,826
This means, this match is
a great opportunity to test their skills.

32
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:25,792
Champion

33
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:34,830
Yoo, Oh-seong

34
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,305
Chae, Min-seo

35
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:47,258
Where are you heading to?

36
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:54,864
Can you give me a ride?

37
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:58,170
Where are you going?

38
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,340
To the terminal

39
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:04,482
Do you have any money? 
No.

40
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,146
Hop on!

41
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:33,503
7 years later....

42
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:44,753
No way!

43
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:47,287
Hey..
What's the matter?

44
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:49,554
No.

45
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,495
Alright.

46
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,019
Ah, what the hell is this?

47
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:02,131
Next.

48
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:07,637
2700..

49
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,865
2800..

50
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:14,512
2900..

51
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:18,516
3000.

52
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:42,363
Next.

53
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:11,465
It should be 100 won,
Just give me 50.

54
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:25,718
Can it be washed in a second?
Yup, just in a second.

55
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:27,310
Hey, I'm busy.

56
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:53,645
Hey, Miss.

57
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:59,681
Laughter brings you luck
It not only brings you luck but also beauty.

58
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:02,980
Usually when girls laugh..

59
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:10,561
- Why don't you try laughing?
- Pardon me?

60
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:15,500
Laugh, you son of a bitch!

61
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:19,395
It will bring you luck!

62
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:27,939
Hey, why you crackin' up?

63
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,318
You son of a bitch.

64
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:36,455
Who the hell do you think you are?

65
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:38,013
Get your ass over here.

66
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,363
What you looking at?

67
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:16,021
Let's see what you've got with your luck.

68
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,397
Laugh, you idiot!

69
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:28,266
Then you shall be lucky.

70
00:13:56,869 --> 00:14:00,270
Are you nuts?
Watch where you're going.

71
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:04,842
Man,
What's that smell? lt smells like shit.

72
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:32,860
You know..
Gummy bears doesn't have bears in it..

73
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:39,611
Hey.. about the other day..

74
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:41,975
How am I supposed to know..

75
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:49,344
A Boxing Match
Between Korea and Thailand.

76
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:31,652
Attention!
Salute to the master.

77
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:45,044
You!
Are you here to learn boxing?

78
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:47,171
Yes, sir.

79
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:52,584
I'm here to box and
I will someday become a champion,

80
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:54,347
and honor the nation.

81
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:00,481
What about you?
Yes.

82
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:05,188
I'm here to learn from the great master

83
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:11,800
and to train my body and mind..

84
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:15,341
and strengthen power and..

85
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:16,706
Cut the bullshit.

86
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:23,070
So.. You are here to become a champion

87
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:27,219
and become a millionaire
and have fame and all that?

88
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:30,279
Is that so?
Yes..

89
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:35,383
I have two things
for you to keep in mind.

90
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:39,559
No matter where you go.

91
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:45,132
Don't you ever curse
and talk like trash.

92
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:46,733
Yes, sir.

93
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:50,066
It's okay for normal people,

94
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:56,546
But for boxers
they will criticize you no matter what.

95
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:02,483
And..
Even if you become a dump scooper,

96
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:07,190
Be good at it.

97
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,517
It doesn't matter what you do
as long as you are good at it!

98
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:13,922
Even if you end up with
a bucket filled with shit in your hand..

99
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:20,104
If you are the best man at it
then you are the champion.

100
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,566
You know what I mean?

101
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:22,840
Yes, sir.

102
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:27,869
Enough for today.
Yes.

103
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:47,154
Hello!

104
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,677
Kim, Duk-koo!
Yes, sir.

105
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:15,452
Do you want to spar with me?

106
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:20,053
Don't let it in!
If you let in..

107
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:34,970
Pull up your guard.

108
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,305
Switch the sparring partner.

109
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:47,117
Enough, Duk-koo.
You get down and Pil-seung, you're up.

110
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,037
Why is it so complicated?

111
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:43,200
Hey, Kim, Duk-koo

112
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:46,971
It's almost curfew.

113
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:53,673
If your home's too far
won't you just sleep in the gym?

114
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:04,982
If we always get beat up
everyday, we'll become crippled.

115
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:08,883
You know what?

116
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:11,054
What?

117
00:23:13,358 --> 00:23:19,957
I could have gotten
that major punch right at the..

118
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:21,793
Why didn't you?

119
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:25,000
I was about to..

120
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,365
But you know that kid was master's puppy.

121
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:34,212
Do you want to go for it?

122
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:37,113
Me? Why?
So I can get beat up like hell?

123
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:41,812
Hey.. boxing is the fairest thing in the world.

124
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:43,179
What is?

125
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:45,983
Have you seen a boxer with three arms?

126
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:50,416
You got two arms to fight with
and same goes with your opponent.

127
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:53,755
If the guy connect 10 punches.

128
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:56,766
You go with 15
or 20 if you wish.

129
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:01,302
You know how much you make
if you become a champion?

130
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:03,463
How much?

131
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:08,545
I would say over 10 million won.

132
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:24,429
The blue corner, 68 Kg, WBK.

133
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:29,560
Dong-a Gymnasium picnic party
The Asian Champion
Hwang, Joon-seok.

134
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:44,844
The Red Corner, 63 Kg
WBK World Champion, Lee, Sang-bong.

135
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:52,679
The winner will be
prized with 20 fried chickens!

136
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:39,061
1978 MBC
A rookie king selective match.

137
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:41,832
The new kids are always full of passion.

138
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:48,313
Open burrow is more
common than stomache burrow.

139
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:50,148
He turned his back with his eyes closed.

140
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:52,139
Here it comes again.
Right hook.

141
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,143
He's down.

142
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,597
Hey,
what's the matter?

143
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:22,712
I had peach juice after the weight check.

144
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:24,576
I've been suffering from
diarrhea since then..

145
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:28,386
You shouldn't have
drank anything without eating.

146
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:34,559
Next will be a semi-final match for light weight
fighters Jong-shil Lee from Gookdong Gymnasium

147
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:38,086
and Duk-koo Kim from
Dong-a Gymnasium will also be fighting.

148
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:43,768
That fighter is quick but weak.

149
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:47,005
Push him until 30 seconds are left and
When I say go, then start attacking him.

150
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:48,302
Understood?

151
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:52,170
First round.
The match has begun.

152
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:39,888
Stand up, you idiot.

153
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:58,705
How many light weights
do we have in this gym?

154
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:03,303
If you've got picked for
one of the two tickets.

155
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:06,906
At least you should have tried your best.

156
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,318
I'm so sorry.

157
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:12,720
Next!
Park, Jong-pal, you are up!

158
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:19,764
From now on, you don't
have to show up anymore.

159
00:28:19,764 --> 00:28:22,130
You are on your own.

160
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:31,272
And you, you're the winner today
and this is for the winner.

161
00:28:31,576 --> 00:28:34,136
Understood?
Yes, sir..

162
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:42,849
There it goes again.

163
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:04,205
Other coaches walk loudly
while players are asleep.

164
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:07,537
But our master walks silently

165
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:09,614
when he comes into the gym

166
00:29:09,614 --> 00:29:13,948
not to wake us up.

167
00:29:15,987 --> 00:29:21,226
Even if it's lower
than all the other voices.

168
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:26,289
Our boss was watching like this, I stepped
backward and the boss shouted "Here it comes."

169
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:44,040
And that's when I gave
him a punch. Then he fell over.

170
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:48,776
Hey,
what are you doing?

171
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:02,593
I want to go to middle school.
Can you support me?

172
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:08,039
My father's money goes here.

173
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:10,599
So we are dead broke.

174
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,940
Ask my step mother?

175
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:19,406
Now..
you mean my dad..

176
00:30:22,086 --> 00:30:23,610
So?

177
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:29,025
My dad is like a..

178
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:34,291
He locked me in the attick,

179
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:43,940
and fed me like a bird.

180
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:50,372
To hide my existence
to the woman he lives with.

181
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:58,618
And there..
I made a pact to myself.

182
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:03,551
I don't have a father.

183
00:31:06,297 --> 00:31:08,925
My father is dead.

184
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:12,561
I have lived that way since then.

185
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:23,206
What am I?

186
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:28,143
You?
Duk-koo, the dog.

187
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:31,979
How you know it was my nickname?

188
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:42,131
Wow..
You are a genius!

189
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:46,259
You only went up to grammar school.
Where'd you learn your English?

190
00:31:47,171 --> 00:31:49,332
Anyway, you were wrong.

191
00:31:50,508 --> 00:31:56,469
Why am I Duk-koo the dog
and not Kim, Duk-koo?

192
00:31:58,716 --> 00:32:04,756
l almost became
a Baek Duk-koo.. never mind.

193
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,747
I was never born.

194
00:32:07,191 --> 00:32:14,290
Anyways,
I was originally Lee, Duk-koo,

195
00:32:14,365 --> 00:32:16,026
But..

196
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:24,003
My dad passed away
and my mom got married again,

197
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:28,136
and as long as I could remember

198
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:36,216
My last name has
changed two or three times.

199
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:44,490
Anyway.. Later on
people called me Kim, Duk-koo.

200
00:32:45,563 --> 00:32:46,798
So.

201
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:47,992
So I.. Well, what the hell..

202
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:55,405
Remember? Master told us not to curse

203
00:33:03,948 --> 00:33:10,183
So.. just call me Duk-koo
the dog.. I could care less..

204
00:33:16,027 --> 00:33:18,096
Alright.. I like Duk-koo the dog.

205
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:23,693
See? That's why..
Got it. Sang-bong the dog?

206
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:29,462
From now on, anyone with
no father will have the dog at the end of their name.

207
00:33:33,911 --> 00:33:40,407
Really? then we are brothers
since we both end with "the dog."

208
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:49,691
Right on!
Cheers, brother!

209
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:51,451
You be the older brother!

210
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:19,389
It's a new begining...
Women are like blocks of my life...

211
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:42,479
Asian-Pacific Championship Title Match.

212
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:55,760
Usually, I don't ask this kind of favors

213
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,630
But it's my friend's birthday...

214
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:02,895
No way, there might not be
people wanting illegal tickets.

215
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:05,203
Then give me some more.

216
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:09,663
Well my friends from
hometown will be visiting.

217
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:15,271
No, there are rules you know..

218
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:22,552
OK, then you can pay me 20% next time.

219
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:26,151
Alright, then 10%!

220
00:35:28,092 --> 00:35:30,925
You don't have to pay me next Time.

221
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:37,335
When's the next match?

222
00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:38,563
I don't know.

223
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:53,779
You take 8,000 won and l take 10,000 won.

224
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:58,746
What round you got?
4th round.

225
00:35:58,856 --> 00:36:01,450
How about me? What round do I get?

226
00:36:06,597 --> 00:36:09,862
Kim, Duk-koo is squinting his face

227
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,433
Here we have
the fourth round of bloody battle.

228
00:36:13,804 --> 00:36:15,999
The refree is headed towards Kim, Duk-koo.

229
00:36:16,073 --> 00:36:18,109
Duk-koo
Kim, Duk-koo is the winner.

230
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:21,442
- He's got the victory on decision.
- He made a victorious comeback.

231
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:24,072
Kim, Duk-koo looks stunned, indeed.

232
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:28,719
And he cheers for the opponent
What a gentleman with great manners.

233
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:31,813
It sure was a bloody battle.
He's got to check if the opponent is alright.

234
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:34,287
Yes, the fourth round was a vicious round.

235
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:52,905
Here, take it.

236
00:36:57,982 --> 00:37:01,281
You earned this by being beaten up.
You know what I mean.

237
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:07,081
Try hard. Do well in the 6th round next Time.

238
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:08,788
Yes.

239
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:21,806
Waitress, here!

240
00:37:21,806 --> 00:37:23,574
Give us 2 more portions.

241
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:26,110
The same one?

242
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:27,543
Yes.

243
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,883
How come I'm still not full?

244
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:36,410
There must be a beggar
family living in my stomach.

245
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:41,125
My mother says when you're hungry

246
00:37:47,865 --> 00:37:51,062
you will feel better to eat grinded
perilla japonica with sesame oil.

247
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,636
I already tried.. but it doesn't help..
Water is good for hunger.

248
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:59,966
It's easy to get.. It's embarrassing to
get food for free but for water it's not.

249
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:10,984
Can you afford it?

250
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:13,451
Don't worry.

251
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:20,689
I sure can let you eat as much meat 
as you want on your birthday.

252
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:24,832
And I got the check.

253
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,935
20,000 won?

254
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:32,736
Don't worry, I also have some more money.

255
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:36,679
What are you staring at? Start eating.

256
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:43,484
Why aren't you eating?

257
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:47,187
It's not roasted yet.

258
00:41:16,607 --> 00:41:18,768
1981 . 4
Win vs Lim.

259
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:52,301
1981 . 8

260
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:15,858
1981 . 9

261
00:42:17,401 --> 00:42:19,164
OPBF Championship Title Match.

262
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:15,084
1981 . 12
Win Ohkwubo Kashiro

263
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:55,989
We've just moved in to the 4th floor.

264
00:43:56,934 --> 00:43:58,128
Uh, really?

265
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:01,065
We work for Korea Multi-business..

266
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:03,705
Nice to meet you..

267
00:44:03,774 --> 00:44:04,536
Yes..

268
00:44:28,032 --> 00:44:29,659
What's wrong?

269
00:44:30,968 --> 00:44:34,301
What's Korea Multi-business?

270
00:44:39,109 --> 00:44:40,667
Don't know.

271
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,465
Yes..

272
00:45:28,992 --> 00:45:30,254
Hi!

273
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:56,245
I'm Duk-koo Kim
national Champion for light weight.

274
00:45:58,622 --> 00:46:02,422
Has our accounting clerk lady come up yet?

275
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,225
No, not yet.

276
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,989
OK, I get it. See you.

277
00:46:13,737 --> 00:46:16,900
Have you seen Jong-pal Park
the Oriental Champion?

278
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:20,073
I don't know.. I didn't see anybody.

279
00:46:21,812 --> 00:46:28,650
Can you tell him that
I'm looking for him if you see him?

280
00:46:32,589 --> 00:46:34,853
I don't know whom you're talking about.

281
00:47:37,487 --> 00:47:39,318
Women are like blocks of my life.

282
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:32,369
Duk-koo Kim? What is he?

283
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:36,346
Rush! Rush, Robot
Fly to the sky, Taekwon V.

284
00:48:39,783 --> 00:48:42,911
Brave heart and justice is the name

285
00:48:43,153 --> 00:48:46,256
With courage and spirit.

286
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:52,593
Dashing through the sky with open arms.

287
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:56,533
Great! Awesome!
Taekwon V is the killer.

288
00:48:56,533 --> 00:49:00,094
Who could dare to put up with him?

289
00:49:33,437 --> 00:49:36,634
Rush! Rush, Robot.

290
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:40,444
Fly to the sky, Taekwon V.

291
00:49:40,444 --> 00:49:43,538
You are born to fight for justice.

292
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:47,944
Who could dare to put up with him?

293
00:50:14,378 --> 00:50:16,346
May I have a cup of
tea with you after work?

294
00:50:26,123 --> 00:50:29,092
Anyone seen my Levi's?

295
00:50:33,163 --> 00:50:36,155
I'm not so into boxing.

296
00:50:39,503 --> 00:50:41,767
Then what are you into?

297
00:50:45,976 --> 00:50:47,739
Picture searching games.

298
00:51:04,661 --> 00:51:06,322
What year were you born?

299
00:51:30,153 --> 00:51:33,122
Shall I make a guess?

300
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:36,589
Do you believe in such things?

301
00:51:38,695 --> 00:51:40,219
I'm also into physiognomy.

302
00:51:41,231 --> 00:51:46,066
l go to church and my boyfriend's
a steward at the church.

303
00:51:52,209 --> 00:51:54,769
If so, I should go to church too.

304
00:51:56,379 --> 00:52:01,908
And pray that you would break up
with your boyfriend in the near future.

305
00:52:07,724 --> 00:52:10,352
Can I ask you something?

306
00:52:10,827 --> 00:52:12,124
what?

307
00:52:12,329 --> 00:52:16,698
Why do you have to work out
in suits with your name on it?

308
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:20,496
It prevents you

309
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:23,306
from being lazy all the time.

310
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:26,742
People notice my name

311
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:29,945
and that's why I try to do my best.

312
00:52:34,918 --> 00:52:37,785
Can I ask one?

313
00:52:38,555 --> 00:52:39,522
Sure.

314
00:52:41,224 --> 00:52:43,590
How long have you been
going out with your boyfriend?

315
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:49,696
I can walk alone from here.

316
00:52:51,601 --> 00:52:55,537
My boyfriend waits for me
in front of the house.

317
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:18,957
Dad
How come you are so late?

318
00:53:19,296 --> 00:53:21,958
Why are you out here in the cold weather?

319
00:53:52,762 --> 00:53:54,161
Something's wrong?

320
00:54:00,003 --> 00:54:01,834
Are you nuts?

321
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:03,863
What's the matter with you?

322
00:54:06,376 --> 00:54:10,107
I think I can do it.

323
00:54:10,981 --> 00:54:13,643
I can't hear the spirit.

324
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:16,575
I'm all about the big match.

325
00:54:17,654 --> 00:54:20,487
If we beat Han, Seung-hee
then we are No. 1 in Korea.

326
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,625
Keep it up!

327
00:54:35,705 --> 00:54:37,400
Everybody, attention!

328
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:47,474
Next month, there shall be
a third Oriental Champion.

329
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:56,850
Kwang-min Kim will
be fighting with Duk-koo.

330
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:06,294
Help each other so that Duk-koo
can win. Work hard for the victory.
