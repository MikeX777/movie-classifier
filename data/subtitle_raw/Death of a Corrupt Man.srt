1
00:00:52,117 --> 00:00:54,858
Death of a Corrupt Man

2
00:02:23,157 --> 00:02:28,822
Xav, do you love me? 
Say that you love me.

3
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:32,996
Go to sleep!

4
00:02:32,997 --> 00:02:35,116
Why don't you want to say that?

5
00:02:35,117 --> 00:02:36,982
But I do.

6
00:02:38,677 --> 00:02:41,418
Why don't we live together?

7
00:02:42,317 --> 00:02:46,059
- Do I bother you?
- No.

8
00:02:47,037 --> 00:02:51,542
Then, tell me that you love me
and will never forget me.

9
00:02:51,557 --> 00:02:53,979
Just like in that song.

10
00:02:54,677 --> 00:02:59,341
Oh God!
You skid sometimes.

11
00:02:59,997 --> 00:03:02,116
What does "skid" mean, Xav?

12
00:03:02,117 --> 00:03:04,062
Go to sleep!

13
00:03:09,197 --> 00:03:13,099
- Who's there?
- It's me, Philip.

14
00:03:19,637 --> 00:03:23,061
- Are you alone?
- She is asleep.

15
00:03:24,157 --> 00:03:27,820
- What time is it?
- Five in the morning.

16
00:03:28,037 --> 00:03:30,778
You could ask that on the phone.

17
00:03:32,637 --> 00:03:34,916
I'm in trouble.

18
00:03:34,917 --> 00:03:38,102
- Is it serious?
- Very serious.

19
00:03:38,957 --> 00:03:41,186
Serrano.

20
00:03:42,997 --> 00:03:45,738
I killed Serrano.

21
00:03:47,197 --> 00:03:52,100
- Xav, who's there?
- Nobody! Go to sleep!

22
00:03:58,197 --> 00:04:00,938
What a scumbag he was!

23
00:04:01,277 --> 00:04:04,018
But he made you a deputy.

24
00:04:05,197 --> 00:04:09,463
Exactly. 
This was the beginning of the end.

25
00:04:10,397 --> 00:04:12,076
You never complained before.

26
00:04:12,077 --> 00:04:15,756
I was getting something.
Well, of course, not billions.

27
00:04:15,757 --> 00:04:18,316
For example, 
fees for building permits,

28
00:04:18,317 --> 00:04:21,342
purchase of land and so on.

29
00:04:21,757 --> 00:04:27,058
I wanted to stay.
But Serrano pulled out my receipts.

30
00:04:28,197 --> 00:04:33,817
And I had to start all over again.
Bribes, like a swamp.

31
00:04:35,237 --> 00:04:39,218
With the latest scam on the Rue de 
Vaugirard, I almost got caught.

32
00:04:41,357 --> 00:04:45,623
And that bastard demanded
that I resign.

33
00:04:46,957 --> 00:04:50,699
Serrano is a moralist!
It's ridiculous!

34
00:04:52,637 --> 00:04:55,596
I got it,
they've decided to present

35
00:04:55,597 --> 00:04:58,861
Dupere's candidacy at the next election.

36
00:05:01,837 --> 00:05:04,578
Dupere on my place!
Scoundrels!

37
00:05:06,797 --> 00:05:10,460
This resignation would ruin 
my political career

38
00:05:12,317 --> 00:05:14,756
and my whole life.

39
00:05:14,757 --> 00:05:17,716
The resignation letter was ready.

40
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:19,556
He said that if I didn't sign it,

41
00:05:19,557 --> 00:05:23,538
he will give all the compromising 
materials to journalists.

42
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:26,076
My dossier, three or four pages
of typewritten text.

43
00:05:26,077 --> 00:05:30,820
He put it in a folder in the safe.
But he didn't lock it.

44
00:05:32,877 --> 00:05:35,876
He said: 
"You don't have to be a deputy"

45
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:39,596
He just made fun of me.

46
00:05:39,597 --> 00:05:44,420
I flared up and gave him a slap. 
We grappled.

47
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:46,956
He began to strangle me,
and I grabbed the first thing

48
00:05:46,957 --> 00:05:51,196
that came to hand. 
It was a paperweight.

49
00:05:51,197 --> 00:05:53,824
I twisted and hit him.

50
00:05:53,877 --> 00:05:58,620
He fell, 
and I was not going to kill him.

51
00:06:02,677 --> 00:06:04,940
That's all!

52
00:06:05,717 --> 00:06:11,667
When did this happen?
- In the evening, about ten.

53
00:06:14,477 --> 00:06:17,218
And then what did you do?

54
00:06:17,637 --> 00:06:21,796
I went immediately to a meeting of
parliament in the Palais Bourbon,

55
00:06:21,797 --> 00:06:24,618
so that they could see me there.

56
00:06:35,037 --> 00:06:38,904
When I entered the hall, the clock was
five minutes to eleven.

57
00:06:39,877 --> 00:06:43,116
And until that moment you have no alibi?

58
00:06:43,117 --> 00:06:46,507
That's the thing.
Well, and you?

59
00:06:47,957 --> 00:06:52,416
- What did you do last night?
- I was with you.

60
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:59,196
Then this is how it's going to be! Listen!

61
00:06:59,197 --> 00:07:02,756
Yesterday you had dinner
here with me and Christian.

62
00:07:02,757 --> 00:07:05,996
At half-past ten, I went to the parliament,
and now I must go.

63
00:07:05,997 --> 00:07:08,396
Did anyone see you here?

64
00:07:08,397 --> 00:07:11,695
- Only Kebir.
- He won't whistle.

65
00:07:12,157 --> 00:07:14,898
Then I'll see you at 12.

66
00:07:15,237 --> 00:07:21,266
Wait, there will be a lot of people at 
Serrano's. You should show yourself.

67
00:07:21,837 --> 00:07:26,023
I understand, but I... I...

68
00:07:26,317 --> 00:07:29,945
- I will go.
- Thanks.

69
00:08:22,597 --> 00:08:26,225
- Who was it?
- Santa Claus.

70
00:09:28,437 --> 00:09:31,542
- Have you been to Xav?
- Yes.

71
00:09:33,677 --> 00:09:35,860
And what?

72
00:09:36,517 --> 00:09:40,783
He had dinner last night with us.
Then I went to the parliament.

73
00:09:45,957 --> 00:09:47,716
Listen to the latest news.

74
00:09:47,717 --> 00:09:51,396
This morning, deputy Michelle Serrano
was found dead in his office.

75
00:09:51,397 --> 00:09:54,396
- Well, see you in the evening?
- We'll call each other.

76
00:09:54,397 --> 00:09:56,396
The first observation suggests murder.

77
00:09:56,397 --> 00:09:58,076
Our correspondent was able to meet

78
00:09:58,077 --> 00:09:59,636
witnesses at the crime scene.

79
00:09:59,637 --> 00:10:02,516
- Monsieur Gonsales, are you a cleaner?
- Yes, I am.

80
00:10:02,517 --> 00:10:05,716
- Did you find the body at 9 in the morning?
- You could say that.

81
00:10:05,717 --> 00:10:09,619
Many people were going to work,
and we'd been rubbing since 7:00.

82
00:10:09,677 --> 00:10:14,036
- Where were you at that moment?
- Upstairs! On the 32nd floor.

83
00:10:14,037 --> 00:10:18,276
- Tell us more.
- Well, I was yelling, right to left, as usual.

84
00:10:18,277 --> 00:10:21,156
And suddenly I saw a man 
with his head on the table.

85
00:10:21,157 --> 00:10:24,556
I stopped rubbing. I thought he might be
sleeping or drank a lot the day before.

86
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:27,836
I called my partner.
We started knocking on the glass.

87
00:10:27,837 --> 00:10:30,516
But the man wouldn't react.
Absolutely.

88
00:10:30,517 --> 00:10:32,436
Then I realized that something was wrong.

89
00:10:32,437 --> 00:10:36,782
- And you called the police?
- That was later, I won't miss any details.

90
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:40,996
The cabinet of deputy Serrano
is in the one of the black mirrored towers.

91
00:10:40,997 --> 00:10:43,658
Square Defense.

92
00:11:06,037 --> 00:11:08,116
- I'm Xavier Marechal.
- You can't come here, monsieur!

93
00:11:08,117 --> 00:11:11,586
- Representative of deputy Dubaye.
- I'll call the foreman.

94
00:11:13,797 --> 00:11:15,516
I desperately need to
make some shots.

95
00:11:15,517 --> 00:11:17,316
You can't!

96
00:11:17,317 --> 00:11:20,596
Soon the vultures in
limousines will start to arrive.

97
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:25,705
One villain killed another. When will
we cleanse ourselves from this infection?

98
00:11:27,837 --> 00:11:29,636
Here is the gentleman.

99
00:11:29,637 --> 00:11:31,076
- Are you Monsieur Marechal?
- Yes.

100
00:11:31,077 --> 00:11:34,036
Come in. Commissioner Perne is
waiting for you on the 32rd floor.

101
00:11:34,037 --> 00:11:36,316
You can't come here! Stand back!

102
00:11:36,317 --> 00:11:39,786
My colleague Moreau
from Criminal Police.

103
00:11:40,717 --> 00:11:45,381
I understand that the death of
Mr. Serrano shocked Mr. Dubaye.

104
00:11:45,477 --> 00:11:47,916
They're good friends.

105
00:11:47,917 --> 00:11:52,103
Well, we would like to...
I was almost going to say 'to interrogate'

106
00:11:52,197 --> 00:11:56,736
I would like to know
what he thinks about this disaster.

107
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:00,596
I represent deputy Dubaye.

108
00:12:00,597 --> 00:12:03,956
He's now at the meeting of the parliamentary
commission,

109
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:06,996
which was called due to the death of
Monsieur Serrano.

110
00:12:06,997 --> 00:12:12,981
And do you know when and where 
Dubaye saw Serrano for the last time?

111
00:12:12,997 --> 00:12:15,956
No, but I can tell you when
I last saw Monsieur Dubaye.

112
00:12:15,957 --> 00:12:18,156
And of course, it was yesterday 
evening at about 23:00.

113
00:12:18,157 --> 00:12:20,556
Yes, we had supper at his place.

114
00:12:20,557 --> 00:12:22,756
And, of course, Madame Dubaye

115
00:12:22,757 --> 00:12:24,796
prepared my favorite dish,
fish with oranges.

116
00:12:24,797 --> 00:12:29,415
Of course! All the important issues 
are solved in France during dinner.

117
00:12:29,477 --> 00:12:31,956
Monsieur Marechal, you only
represent your friend, and you,

118
00:12:31,957 --> 00:12:34,743
are apparently surprised 
with our questions.

119
00:12:35,037 --> 00:12:37,116
But I'm going to surprise you even more,
because I'll say

120
00:12:37,117 --> 00:12:41,337
that the murder of the deputy 
Serrano was inevitable.

121
00:12:42,397 --> 00:12:45,756
The fact is that he possessed
some very dangerous documents.

122
00:12:45,757 --> 00:12:49,226
People were afraid of him, 
but you can't fear forever.

123
00:12:49,237 --> 00:12:51,036
What? Policy?

124
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:55,701
I would say that this crime is both political,
and criminal.

125
00:12:55,837 --> 00:12:59,864
The goal was not a robbery,
we found eight million in his safe.

126
00:13:00,117 --> 00:13:02,903
But Monsieur Serrano kept a diary.

127
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:06,756
You are probably
unfamiliar with that kind of literature?

128
00:13:06,757 --> 00:13:08,476
Certainly not.

129
00:13:08,477 --> 00:13:11,516
Wait! There's something wrong!
There are other details here.

130
00:13:11,517 --> 00:13:15,703
Regarding the excellent dinner with
Madame Dubaye.

131
00:13:16,517 --> 00:13:18,541
Durieux!

132
00:13:24,997 --> 00:13:26,916
I'll get.

133
00:13:26,917 --> 00:13:30,196
So, Monsieur Marechal, your 
statement about yesterday's dinner,

134
00:13:30,197 --> 00:13:33,541
I was almost going to say 'the alibi of
Monsieur Dubaye'...

135
00:13:33,557 --> 00:13:37,196
you are ready, of course, to confirm 
it under oath, it's clear.

136
00:13:37,197 --> 00:13:39,436
But some statements are contrary.

137
00:13:39,437 --> 00:13:42,178
You mean the testimony
of Mademoiselle Braco?

138
00:13:42,237 --> 00:13:46,236
Yes, Marceline Braco,
the secretary of deputy Serrano.

139
00:13:46,237 --> 00:13:48,739
Mademoiselle!

140
00:13:52,437 --> 00:13:55,156
- Hello!
- Hello!

141
00:13:55,157 --> 00:13:59,396
Mademoiselle Braco, r epeat please
to Monsieur Marechal what you told us

142
00:13:59,397 --> 00:14:01,316
about Monsieur Dubaye.

143
00:14:01,317 --> 00:14:07,062
I heard Monsieur Serrano said that Monsieur
Dubaye will be coming to him in the evening.

144
00:14:07,317 --> 00:14:10,103
- Time?
- At ten o'clock

145
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:13,076
Did you know about this meeting, Monsieur
Marechal?

146
00:14:13,077 --> 00:14:15,876
No, but probably
Monsieur Serrano cancelled the meeting

147
00:14:15,877 --> 00:14:18,356
and didn't tell Mademoiselle Braco about it.

148
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,596
But, usually, my boss...

149
00:14:19,597 --> 00:14:23,499
Couldn't he go to the toilet or
change his tie without warning you?

150
00:14:23,877 --> 00:14:25,076
He surely could.

151
00:14:25,077 --> 00:14:28,375
Enough! You are free. Thank you.

152
00:14:28,677 --> 00:14:31,396
It was her who called the commissariat.

153
00:14:31,397 --> 00:14:35,902
And before the police arrived, she was
able and had time to steal the notebook.

154
00:14:36,437 --> 00:14:40,816
- What notebook?
- I mean the diary.

155
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:44,796
The dossier, which I mentioned.

156
00:14:44,797 --> 00:14:48,664
- How? Was it stolen?
- Didn't you know about it?

157
00:14:48,917 --> 00:14:51,544
I'm not clairvoyant, am I?

158
00:14:52,077 --> 00:14:54,876
You told me that they had no
intention to rob him, and now you say

159
00:14:54,877 --> 00:14:57,345
that the diary was stolen.

160
00:14:57,837 --> 00:15:01,818
Who needed it?
Do you at least understand the motive?

161
00:15:03,997 --> 00:15:06,756
Thank you, Monsieur Marechal.

162
00:15:06,757 --> 00:15:08,876
That's very kind of you to come, Monsieur
Marechal.

163
00:15:08,877 --> 00:15:13,063
Hopefully you'll help us next time.

164
00:15:13,557 --> 00:15:17,476
On the other hand, should we disturb you
again? What do you think about it, Moreau?

165
00:15:17,477 --> 00:15:21,156
I wouldn't mind watching again
how you act being surprised,

166
00:15:21,157 --> 00:15:25,196
hearing about the theft of the diary.
It was played perfectly!

167
00:15:25,197 --> 00:15:27,876
- Slander!
- And the scene with his secretary

168
00:15:27,877 --> 00:15:33,144
was really nicely directed. Always at your
service.

169
00:15:33,277 --> 00:15:35,745
Thanks.

170
00:15:38,877 --> 00:15:41,026
Good morning, Monsieur Xavier!

171
00:15:41,997 --> 00:15:44,236
- Good morning, Monsieur Xavier!
- Good morning, Françoise.

172
00:15:44,237 --> 00:15:46,436
Everything's the same.
The Dutch were here.

173
00:15:46,437 --> 00:15:49,796
- What do they want?
- I think a delay of payment to the fifteenth.

174
00:15:49,797 --> 00:15:52,538
They gave me a box of chocolates.

175
00:15:52,957 --> 00:15:55,996
Chew the chocolate and tell them
that I won't be here till sixteenth.

176
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:57,756
And this?

177
00:15:57,757 --> 00:16:02,023
Monsieur Fondari called and asked to 
call him back. He said it's urgent.

178
00:16:05,717 --> 00:16:08,076
Hello! Monsieur Fondari please!

179
00:16:08,077 --> 00:16:10,596
Monsieur Fondari,
Monsieur Marechal speaking.

180
00:16:10,597 --> 00:16:15,215
You already know about Serrano!?
We need to talk.

181
00:16:15,477 --> 00:16:18,662
- Today?
- As soon as possible.

182
00:16:20,317 --> 00:16:21,276
Hello!

183
00:16:21,277 --> 00:16:22,916
Monsieur Brumaire and Monsieur Lalo.

184
00:16:22,917 --> 00:16:24,836
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

185
00:16:24,837 --> 00:16:26,916
- Good morning, Monsieur Marechal.
- Hello.

186
00:16:26,917 --> 00:16:29,236
- You want to drink?
- Yes, Kir-Champaign.

187
00:16:29,237 --> 00:16:31,978
Marcel! Two Kir-Champagne!

188
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:33,396
So what?

189
00:16:33,397 --> 00:16:36,916
His secretary knew that you were
coming in the evening.

190
00:16:36,917 --> 00:16:38,862
Damn it!

191
00:16:40,437 --> 00:16:43,636
It's OK, she didn't see me.

192
00:16:43,637 --> 00:16:46,423
- Marseille, how long do we have to wait?
- Coming right up!

193
00:16:46,917 --> 00:16:50,916
- You know a guy by the name of Moreau?
- No. What's the matter?

194
00:16:50,917 --> 00:16:56,457
He is from the criminal police, sarcastic
and he does not believe in your alibi.

195
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:59,947
- They'll make him to believe.
- And if they can't?

196
00:17:00,357 --> 00:17:03,156
I was told there that some diary is missing.

197
00:17:03,157 --> 00:17:06,596
I know everything.
Let's not discuss it here.

198
00:17:06,597 --> 00:17:08,916
- Are you going to dine?
- No, Fondari is waiting for me.

199
00:17:08,917 --> 00:17:10,956
- Fondari?
- Yes.

200
00:17:10,957 --> 00:17:13,476
- There's Christiane.
- Monsieur Lacour!

201
00:17:13,477 --> 00:17:15,556
I'm coming, Mr. general manager.

202
00:17:15,557 --> 00:17:17,516
- Good day!
- Hi, Xavi!

203
00:17:17,517 --> 00:17:19,556
- Hi, Philip!
- Hello!

204
00:17:19,557 --> 00:17:21,276
Hello, Mr. general manager.

205
00:17:21,277 --> 00:17:23,036
Hello! Nice to see you.

206
00:17:23,037 --> 00:17:26,116
The police didn't say anything on Serrano
case.

207
00:17:26,117 --> 00:17:28,156
And do you know anything?

208
00:17:28,157 --> 00:17:30,916
- You look wonderful.
- Thanks to the influence of alcohol.

209
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:33,556
- Stop talking nonsense.
- It's not nonsense.

210
00:17:33,557 --> 00:17:37,676
- You at least tell her not to drink.
- Xavier, you have to influence me!

211
00:17:37,677 --> 00:17:40,356
Where did you disappear anyway?
Last time I saw you...

212
00:17:40,357 --> 00:17:45,021
Yesterday.
Really, you shouldn't drink.

213
00:17:46,597 --> 00:17:48,276
I was just kidding.

214
00:17:48,277 --> 00:17:53,020
- Everything ready, Monsieur deputy!
- Wonderful. Come!

215
00:17:54,957 --> 00:17:58,476
Listen, and didn't Fondari 
invite me to dinner?

216
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:00,516
No, only me.

217
00:18:00,517 --> 00:18:03,276
- Well, how do you like them?
- Whom?

218
00:18:03,277 --> 00:18:05,596
Investigators

219
00:18:05,597 --> 00:18:09,796
Professionals. Nothing more. But the 
case is big, they might want to flash.

220
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:13,380
- You probably know Moreau?
- He's competent.

221
00:18:14,037 --> 00:18:15,516
Did they ask about the diary?

222
00:18:15,517 --> 00:18:18,476
They were actually 
asking if I knew it existed.

223
00:18:18,477 --> 00:18:22,583
I said 'no'.
And did you know about it?

224
00:18:23,837 --> 00:18:25,876
I knew that Serrano kept a diary.

225
00:18:25,877 --> 00:18:27,916
- Whom was he blackmailing?
- Nobody.

226
00:18:27,917 --> 00:18:31,116
Or rather he didn't have to.

227
00:18:31,117 --> 00:18:33,116
But he really had somebody 
in his hands.

228
00:18:33,117 --> 00:18:36,302
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.

229
00:18:36,517 --> 00:18:40,036
While the diary was in the safe,
everybody knew what they have to do.

230
00:18:40,037 --> 00:18:45,019
And now they're afraid that it got into their
hands that don't know the rules of the game.

231
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:47,236
I personally have nothing to do with.

232
00:18:47,237 --> 00:18:49,276
- The more Philippe.
- Monsieur Tomski.

233
00:18:49,277 --> 00:18:52,382
Monsieur Tomski.
Welcome.

234
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:54,476
- I was just passing by, that's why I didn't call.
- That doesn't matter!

235
00:18:54,477 --> 00:18:56,796
A table for Monsieur Tomski.
Please!

236
00:18:56,797 --> 00:19:00,505
You know you're always welcome in my
restaurant.

237
00:19:00,757 --> 00:19:05,739
This way, please!

238
00:19:08,517 --> 00:19:12,225
Bon Appetit!
I recommend turbot.

239
00:19:12,517 --> 00:19:15,258
So what shall we get?

240
00:19:15,917 --> 00:19:18,196
Xav, we must find the diary.

241
00:19:18,197 --> 00:19:20,236
- First the killer.
- And the killer has got the diary.

242
00:19:20,237 --> 00:19:22,420
Can't say that.

243
00:19:22,797 --> 00:19:26,300
- This is for you, Monsieur Marechal.
- Thanks.

244
00:19:26,597 --> 00:19:29,816
- Hello?
- Hello, this is Kebir.

245
00:19:30,597 --> 00:19:33,636
I called you in the office.

246
00:19:33,637 --> 00:19:39,556
Police was just here.
First they asked the concierge.

247
00:19:39,557 --> 00:19:41,636
Then they got to me.

248
00:19:41,637 --> 00:19:44,796
They wanted to know when did you come
back last night if you've been coming out.

249
00:19:44,797 --> 00:19:46,916
And if I saw Philippe's car here.

250
00:19:46,917 --> 00:19:51,456
Thank you for warning.
Sure I will!

251
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:55,101
I'll be calling. Bye.

252
00:19:57,437 --> 00:19:58,836
Philippe was saying 'hello'.

253
00:19:58,837 --> 00:20:03,740
I'd like to chat with him.
And did the cops ask about him?

254
00:20:04,157 --> 00:20:06,876
If they ask me, I must say the same thing,
right?

255
00:20:06,877 --> 00:20:11,382
- He was with me last evening.
- Ok, I got it.

256
00:20:12,437 --> 00:20:17,306
You just take note that for 
my friends that diary means death.

257
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:22,781
You and Philippe must consider. 
If you know anything - Talk!

258
00:20:22,957 --> 00:20:27,063
Otherwise, both of you 
are in a big trouble.

259
00:20:27,597 --> 00:20:29,756
Stop tomfooling!

260
00:20:29,757 --> 00:20:31,796
You said about 3 pages
and now everybody is saying

261
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:36,381
that a diary has been stolen from the safe
Who are you fooling?

262
00:20:37,077 --> 00:20:39,076
Relax, Xav.

263
00:20:39,077 --> 00:20:42,421
How many names are there 
on those 3 pages.

264
00:20:43,477 --> 00:20:45,660
Ok.

265
00:20:45,957 --> 00:20:50,676
Serrano kept a diary,
he wrote down

266
00:20:50,677 --> 00:20:55,295
the amounts and dates
of some contracts.

267
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:58,458
With the names of recipients.

268
00:20:58,517 --> 00:21:02,544
Do you realize what kind of bomb is that,
especially, on the day before elections?

269
00:21:03,237 --> 00:21:05,516
Voters would throw rotten 
eggs on the candidate

270
00:21:05,517 --> 00:21:09,396
who's taking bribes 
and is involved in frauds.

271
00:21:09,397 --> 00:21:12,796
Well, with that diary
Serrano had deputies by the balls.

272
00:21:12,797 --> 00:21:14,636
Well, the kind's dead!
Long live the king!

273
00:21:14,637 --> 00:21:16,756
I never blackmailed anybody
and I will never do that!

274
00:21:16,757 --> 00:21:18,756
In that case destroy the diary!

275
00:21:18,757 --> 00:21:21,796
I've been thinking about it.
But I'm a politician after all.

276
00:21:21,797 --> 00:21:24,356
Oh, politician! Politician!
Such policy doesn't suit me!

277
00:21:24,357 --> 00:21:25,516
I'm out of it!

278
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:28,303
You think I'm not fed up 
with all that?

279
00:21:30,557 --> 00:21:33,742
Look, I'm not going
to settle scores with anybody.

280
00:21:33,997 --> 00:21:36,076
But I must protect myself.
If I become a minister...

281
00:21:36,077 --> 00:21:38,596
- Come down to earth!
- And why not?

282
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:43,476
Why not? I can say why.
Because you are suspected of murder!

283
00:21:43,477 --> 00:21:45,716
They interrogated me,
then Kebir, Braco!

284
00:21:45,717 --> 00:21:47,636
And they wll interrogate Fondari!

285
00:21:47,637 --> 00:21:49,676
They'll smash your alibi,
in which they don't believe,

286
00:21:49,677 --> 00:21:53,783
besides, if they find out you have 
the diary, for you it will be the end.

287
00:21:54,157 --> 00:21:57,217
It's in a safe place,
they won't get it.

288
00:21:57,477 --> 00:22:00,236
I recently bought an apartment
in the Rokankur park.

289
00:22:00,237 --> 00:22:01,756
They won't seek there.

290
00:22:01,757 --> 00:22:05,316
- And the money? You paid them yourself?
- No, with a credit bank.

291
00:22:05,317 --> 00:22:08,476
- But do they have you in their lists?
- There are many other people!

292
00:22:08,477 --> 00:22:10,396
They don't give a shit about the others.

293
00:22:10,397 --> 00:22:12,396
It will take the police 24 hours to find 
your name in their list.

294
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:15,836
Then they'll search the place 
you're calling 'safe',

295
00:22:15,837 --> 00:22:19,340
if only Fondari doesn't go there tonight.

296
00:22:19,837 --> 00:22:25,218
Lurch him. Sometimes even 2 minutes
can settle it.

297
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:28,418
What's wrong with you?
Feeling bad?

298
00:22:31,237 --> 00:22:36,982
You know, Xav, that Fondari,
those cops, I'm crocking up.

299
00:22:37,197 --> 00:22:39,596
Why am I going to Lyons?

300
00:22:39,597 --> 00:22:42,756
All issues can be resolved on the phone.

301
00:22:42,757 --> 00:22:45,436
But there they'll leave me alone.
I'll have there breathing space.

302
00:22:45,437 --> 00:22:48,576
I can't take it anymore. 
Do you understand?

303
00:22:55,877 --> 00:22:58,596
You should have said that at once.

304
00:22:58,597 --> 00:23:02,578
I'll go and get the diary.

305
00:23:06,397 --> 00:23:08,796
- I will draw a plan.
- I know Rokankur.

306
00:23:08,797 --> 00:23:12,187
No, no, no, you can lose
your way there. Look!

307
00:23:23,637 --> 00:23:26,742
Hello, Kebir?! Xavier!

308
00:23:27,637 --> 00:23:30,935
Can you get me a car for 2 hours?

309
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:35,063
Thanks.
You're helping me a great deal.

310
00:23:36,437 --> 00:23:40,476
Meet me at the district boulevard,
where the road to Pontoise begins.

311
00:23:40,477 --> 00:23:44,504
In an hour.
OK, see you.

312
00:23:46,277 --> 00:23:51,396
Look! First to Sourenn,
then highway to Versailles.

313
00:23:51,397 --> 00:23:55,856
Rokankur is here.
First you'll see new houses.

314
00:23:55,917 --> 00:24:00,535
Building 5, will you remember? 4th floor,
second door on the left from the elevator.

315
00:24:00,597 --> 00:24:03,356
4th floor,
second door on the left

316
00:24:03,357 --> 00:24:09,636
There's a small chest in the second room.
The box in the middle is closed.

317
00:24:09,637 --> 00:24:14,585
Here's the key. And keep in mind,
you'll see there a girl.

318
00:24:14,797 --> 00:24:17,076
In the chest box?

319
00:24:17,077 --> 00:24:19,196
She's a friend of mine,
she doesn't have any apartment.

320
00:24:19,197 --> 00:24:20,996
Philippe, Philippe.

321
00:24:20,997 --> 00:24:27,836
Christiane's having an affair with
attorney Lacor, you know about it.

322
00:24:27,837 --> 00:24:30,956
OK! I'll leave the diary in a box locker
at the station.

323
00:24:30,957 --> 00:24:34,699
- Shall I bring you the key?
- That'd be great.

324
00:24:34,957 --> 00:24:38,779
- OK! See you!
- See you!

325
00:24:38,837 --> 00:24:43,342
By the way, have you warned
the lady from the chest box I'll be coming?

326
00:25:05,957 --> 00:25:08,476
Your car broke down?

327
00:25:08,477 --> 00:25:12,219
No, but there are lots of cops
in front of the office.

328
00:25:17,477 --> 00:25:20,423
We must turn near the racecourse.

329
00:25:23,317 --> 00:25:27,503
- What?!
- We're being followed.

330
00:25:31,797 --> 00:25:34,583
We have to lose them.

331
00:25:41,517 --> 00:25:45,145
They were probably on my tail since I left
home.

332
00:25:59,397 --> 00:26:01,580
Kebir!

333
00:26:02,717 --> 00:26:06,107
Run, Xav! Run!

334
00:27:30,917 --> 00:27:33,703
- Did Philippe call you?
- He did, who are you?

335
00:27:33,717 --> 00:27:35,741
Xav.

336
00:27:41,157 --> 00:27:43,864
We're leaving.
Get dressed.

337
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:48,676
- Won't Philippe be going to Lyons?
- He will.

338
00:27:48,677 --> 00:27:50,716
We were supposed to go together.
Something's changed?

339
00:27:50,717 --> 00:27:54,196
- Didn't he say anything?
- He said: "Xav will explain everything".

340
00:27:54,197 --> 00:27:56,436
- No.
- Yes!

341
00:27:56,437 --> 00:28:00,259
- He didn't say Xavier.
- He said 'Xav', but I don't like it.

342
00:28:00,917 --> 00:28:05,217
You don't? Hurry!
They mustn't catch us here!

343
00:28:05,397 --> 00:28:08,536
- Who can catch us?
- Killers.

344
00:28:09,917 --> 00:28:11,896
Wait!

345
00:28:14,797 --> 00:28:16,196
- Did you get the keys and passport?
- Yes.

346
00:28:16,197 --> 00:28:18,096
Let's go!

347
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:22,058
Don't turn off the light.

348
00:28:27,277 --> 00:28:30,575
- Can you explain?
- No!

349
00:28:48,797 --> 00:28:50,596
- Is there another way out?
- I don't understand.

350
00:28:50,597 --> 00:28:54,305
- Another way out?
- Through the kitchen!

351
00:28:57,357 --> 00:28:59,436
Here!

352
00:28:59,437 --> 00:29:01,516
It's the matter of Philippe's life!
Don't come back here!

353
00:29:01,517 --> 00:29:03,316
Meet you at 3
at the Montparnasse Station!

354
00:29:03,317 --> 00:29:05,705
- Got it?!
- Got it!

355
00:29:50,517 --> 00:29:54,977
- Good evening!
- Good evening!

356
00:29:58,397 --> 00:30:01,756
My car! Martha!
He stole my car!

357
00:30:01,757 --> 00:30:04,782
Stop, scoundrel!
This is my car!

358
00:30:18,437 --> 00:30:21,178
It's me, Philippe!

359
00:30:27,757 --> 00:30:29,736
Philippe!

360
00:33:12,077 --> 00:33:14,796
Are you alone mademoiselle?
They made passes at me the entire evening.

361
00:33:14,797 --> 00:33:17,476
And I've been drinking 
coffee all the time.

362
00:33:17,477 --> 00:33:20,696
You know how long I've been 
here hanging around?

363
00:33:25,277 --> 00:33:27,825
What happened?

364
00:33:43,037 --> 00:33:45,778
Have you been asleep?!

365
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:49,940
Listen.
Philippe's dead.

366
00:33:50,797 --> 00:33:55,586
An accident?! No, Christiane.

367
00:34:04,077 --> 00:34:08,980
I understand.
Yes, may be.

368
00:34:10,597 --> 00:34:12,462
Yes.

369
00:34:21,077 --> 00:34:23,818
He's been waiting for that all the time.

370
00:34:30,837 --> 00:34:34,022
Do you have the permition for 
the funeral, madame Dubaye?

371
00:34:35,277 --> 00:34:38,063
Please come into my office.

372
00:34:40,757 --> 00:34:42,436
Come in.

373
00:34:42,437 --> 00:34:44,780
Wait!

374
00:34:48,957 --> 00:34:52,301
I know you were very good friends
with Monsieur Dubaye.

375
00:34:52,637 --> 00:34:55,822
And I don't doubt you're suffering from his
death.

376
00:34:57,197 --> 00:35:01,337
Two deputies repeatedly!
Isn't it too much, Monsieur Marechal?

377
00:35:02,837 --> 00:35:07,945
Serrano's diary is a dangerous thing,
Monsieur Marechal. It attracts the killers.

378
00:35:08,877 --> 00:35:13,017
- You think Monsieur Dubaye had it?
- You know my opinion.

379
00:35:14,397 --> 00:35:19,116
- Dubaye killed Serrano, and nobody else.
- But you know commissioner that...

380
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:23,462
Yes, yes, that you had dinner with Monsieur
Dubaye at the time of the murder.

381
00:35:24,837 --> 00:35:29,945
However, let me tell you,
that it wasn't a very good fiction.

382
00:35:30,677 --> 00:35:33,676
If you, Monsieur Marechal, didn't
have dinner with him that evening,

383
00:35:33,677 --> 00:35:37,305
we would still have him alive.

384
00:35:40,477 --> 00:35:45,425
Let's suppose Philippe killed Serrano.
And did you find Philippe's murderer?

385
00:35:46,517 --> 00:35:48,780
No.

386
00:35:49,917 --> 00:35:51,916
I'll see you through the service entrance.

387
00:35:51,917 --> 00:35:55,076
Perhaops Madame Dubaye doesn't
want to talk to journalists.

388
00:35:55,077 --> 00:35:58,819
- Who killed him?
- I have no idea.

389
00:35:59,197 --> 00:36:03,303
But I know that the money Philippe left
will not last long.

390
00:36:04,357 --> 00:36:08,020
- Do you have the Serrano diary?
- What makes you think so?

391
00:36:10,637 --> 00:36:17,258
- If I had it, I would sleep restfully.
- Sure. You would sleep forever.

392
00:36:30,397 --> 00:36:34,503
Well, it's nice to be honest, but poor.
Not much.

393
00:36:34,797 --> 00:36:36,636
Being alive is already good.

394
00:36:36,637 --> 00:36:39,856
- Why don't you support me?
- I don't have enough income.

395
00:36:44,477 --> 00:36:48,424
- Everything'll be OK, believe me.
- Unlikely.

396
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:55,857
Get away from the entrance!
Go away!

397
00:37:08,997 --> 00:37:15,345
Monsieur Marechal? I'm Nicola Tomski.
An old friend of Philippe Dubaye.

398
00:37:16,237 --> 00:37:20,196
I was shocked when I read
about his death.

399
00:37:20,197 --> 00:37:22,196
I'm planning to stay 
a few more days in Paris.

400
00:37:22,197 --> 00:37:28,516
So if you encounter some
unexpected difficulties, just call me.

401
00:37:28,517 --> 00:37:34,262
- This is my card.
- Thank you.

402
00:37:35,077 --> 00:37:37,818
See you soon, Monsieur Marechal!

403
00:37:53,837 --> 00:37:59,582
Express train, N 3608
from Brest at the 18th track!

404
00:41:05,197 --> 00:41:08,461
She's not very smart, but cute.

405
00:41:08,477 --> 00:41:09,436
I didn't see her.

406
00:41:09,437 --> 00:41:12,116
- He invited us on saturday.
- That's very nice.

407
00:41:12,117 --> 00:41:16,196
There'll be a big company. Frankly I
don't like when it's so many people.

408
00:41:16,197 --> 00:41:20,236
- Thanks. But it'll be rude to reject.
- That's the thing!

409
00:41:20,237 --> 00:41:23,865
- When will be free tomorrow?
- Like always.

410
00:41:23,957 --> 00:41:26,476
- Shall we go to the movies?
- As you wish.

411
00:41:26,477 --> 00:41:29,116
- I'll get the tickets.
- OK.

412
00:41:29,117 --> 00:41:31,699
Stay here.

413
00:41:32,757 --> 00:41:34,396
Have a nice day!

414
00:41:34,397 --> 00:41:38,856
A Lotos pack, please, and coffee.

415
00:42:01,877 --> 00:42:06,495
Hello! is it cafe? I was to meet
a girl in your cafe.

416
00:42:06,797 --> 00:42:09,583
She's waiting for me at the counter.

417
00:42:09,957 --> 00:42:12,796
Never mind. Say 'girl from Rokankur'

418
00:42:12,797 --> 00:42:15,743
Girl from Rokankur?

419
00:42:17,837 --> 00:42:19,916
- Girl from Rokankur!
- Yes?

420
00:42:19,917 --> 00:42:23,276
There's a phone call for you! 
In the basement, cabine 1.

421
00:42:23,277 --> 00:42:25,017
Thanks.

422
00:42:30,677 --> 00:42:33,418
I'm telling you 
I have nothing to do with it!

423
00:42:41,797 --> 00:42:43,836
Nonsense, absolute nonsense!

424
00:42:43,837 --> 00:42:45,876
Brief, be at nine on the same place.
As you wish.

425
00:42:45,877 --> 00:42:47,662
Hello!

426
00:42:50,397 --> 00:42:53,138
What? Philippe?

427
00:42:54,477 --> 00:42:57,263
This is a nightmare.

428
00:42:57,677 --> 00:43:01,556
Yes, this is all terrible.
But where can we meet?

429
00:43:01,557 --> 00:43:04,876
I'm being followed by two guys.
You have any friends in Paris?

430
00:43:04,877 --> 00:43:07,516
I have a friend.
She lives on St. Jean street.

431
00:43:07,517 --> 00:43:10,065
Give me the phone number.

432
00:43:11,357 --> 00:43:14,417
Seven, two, zero, 
two, seven, zero, three.

433
00:43:14,517 --> 00:43:17,436
- Whom I should ask for?
- Valerie. Valerie Agostinelli.

434
00:43:17,437 --> 00:43:21,657
Go there and stay.
I'll try to come tonight.

435
00:43:22,237 --> 00:43:24,295
Wait.

436
00:43:30,957 --> 00:43:33,876
- Valerie, quickly leave the cabine!
- Why? What's wrong?

437
00:43:33,877 --> 00:43:37,380
Go to the bathroom. Anywhere.
Hurry!

438
00:43:54,917 --> 00:43:58,659
I'll come on Sunday.

439
00:44:03,837 --> 00:44:06,578
Did you come to me?

440
00:44:08,077 --> 00:44:11,216
Hello, Nicole?
Anybody called?

441
00:44:12,677 --> 00:44:14,276
Yes.

442
00:44:14,277 --> 00:44:16,356
Tell him, I'll take care 
of it after the 15th.

443
00:44:16,357 --> 00:44:19,496
What else?
Commissioner Moreau?

444
00:44:19,557 --> 00:44:22,298
Let him wait in my cabinet.

445
00:44:28,477 --> 00:44:31,116
- Hello, commissioner!
- Monsieur Marechal!

446
00:44:31,117 --> 00:44:33,858
- What can I do for you?
- Oh, a lot!

447
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:38,436
I was sitting,
while you were not here, and thinking.

448
00:44:38,437 --> 00:44:40,676
About me?

449
00:44:40,677 --> 00:44:43,384
About your actions.

450
00:44:43,517 --> 00:44:48,956
When there's such a important case,
false evidence can cost you dear.

451
00:44:48,957 --> 00:44:54,383
- I don't understand.
- Is that so? And Kebir?

452
00:44:55,637 --> 00:44:57,476
Do you understand that question?

453
00:44:57,477 --> 00:45:00,676
I'm not asking where you've been tonight.
I don't doubt

454
00:45:00,677 --> 00:45:03,577
that you were invited 
to a dinner to eat chicken.

455
00:45:03,677 --> 00:45:06,716
But poor Kebir was found dead in a car
that didn't belong to him.

456
00:45:06,717 --> 00:45:11,426
He didn't have his own car.
Can you explain this?

457
00:45:13,557 --> 00:45:16,076
- It's a mystery for me too.
- But you knew him well, didn't you?

458
00:45:16,077 --> 00:45:19,580
- Yes, I did. And you know that.
- Yes, I know.

459
00:45:19,757 --> 00:45:23,116
Now you see?
You know everything!

460
00:45:23,117 --> 00:45:27,781
Not yet.
There's still a lot I have to know.

461
00:45:30,997 --> 00:45:33,716
Me too.
For instance, who killed Philippe.

462
00:45:33,717 --> 00:45:36,036
Then help me.

463
00:45:36,037 --> 00:45:42,100
Tell me what's the connection between you,
deputy Dubaye and you, Mr. Marechal?

464
00:45:43,957 --> 00:45:47,824
- Our past.
- And that's all?

465
00:45:48,237 --> 00:45:50,864
Not so little.

466
00:45:52,637 --> 00:45:58,063
Anyway there are so much strange and
inexplicable coincidences.

467
00:45:58,757 --> 00:46:00,756
Judge for yourself!

468
00:46:00,757 --> 00:46:03,316
Kebir found dead
near the house

469
00:46:03,317 --> 00:46:08,265
in which deputy Dubaye sheltered 
a girl but she's not there anymore.

470
00:46:08,837 --> 00:46:12,500
It's not a coincidence,
it's simply a list of facts in the case.

471
00:46:15,277 --> 00:46:18,276
And of course you know 
nothing about that girl.

472
00:46:18,277 --> 00:46:20,076
Absolutely.

473
00:46:20,077 --> 00:46:22,659
There she is.

474
00:46:24,477 --> 00:46:27,796
Tomorrow that photo will be published
in all morning newspapers

475
00:46:27,797 --> 00:46:30,516
as a wanted poster.

476
00:46:30,517 --> 00:46:34,544
And something tells me we'll be
not the only ones looking for her.

477
00:46:34,597 --> 00:46:38,544
The thing is who will be faster. 
Me or Kebir's murderer?

478
00:46:39,397 --> 00:46:44,982
And it's better for the girl 
that I find her first.

479
00:47:50,037 --> 00:47:51,036
Whom are you looking for?

480
00:47:51,037 --> 00:47:55,356
Valerie Agostinelli.
I'm Xavier Marechal.

481
00:47:55,357 --> 00:47:58,098
We were friends with Philippe.

482
00:47:59,957 --> 00:48:02,015
Thanks.

483
00:48:02,597 --> 00:48:04,940
Valerie!

484
00:48:05,797 --> 00:48:09,556
- My name is Leslie. Leslie Collins.
- Nice to meet you.

485
00:48:09,557 --> 00:48:12,742
What a terrible thing happened?!

486
00:48:14,397 --> 00:48:16,996
- Let me introduce you.
- We already made the acquaintance.

487
00:48:16,997 --> 00:48:18,316
- Feel better?
- Yes.

488
00:48:18,317 --> 00:48:22,876
- It was such a shock for Valerie.
- I rushed here like demented.

489
00:48:22,877 --> 00:48:26,380
Dashing aside from everybody.
Even from the police.

490
00:48:27,557 --> 00:48:31,936
You don't need to be afraid of everybody. And
what comes to police, they're looking for you.

491
00:48:32,877 --> 00:48:36,619
Tomorrow in all french newspapers
there will be your photo.

492
00:48:36,837 --> 00:48:39,578
As the saying goes,
of all the rotten luck!

493
00:48:40,157 --> 00:48:42,739
- You have the papers here?
- Yes.

494
00:48:43,877 --> 00:48:46,516
If you feel hungry,
everything's in the refrigerator.

495
00:48:46,517 --> 00:48:47,836
Will you be late?

496
00:48:47,837 --> 00:48:50,476
I don't know, may be,
I'll spend the night in the studio.

497
00:48:50,477 --> 00:48:53,662
- Good-bye!
- Good-bye!

498
00:48:55,877 --> 00:48:59,116
- Why was Philippe killed?
- Because of this.

499
00:48:59,117 --> 00:49:00,916
And what is it?

500
00:49:00,917 --> 00:49:05,376
Here we have the names of some
very respected citizens.

501
00:49:06,157 --> 00:49:09,376
Anthology of bribery,
directory of corruption.

502
00:49:09,717 --> 00:49:14,036
- And what are you going to do with it?
- Use, but yet don't know how.

503
00:49:14,037 --> 00:49:16,778
First we have make a copy of it.

504
00:49:17,237 --> 00:49:19,978
But you can't go 
to a photographer with this.

505
00:49:21,077 --> 00:49:24,023
Can you trust me one more time?

506
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:30,796
Good! Bravo!
Bravo, Leslie!

507
00:49:30,797 --> 00:49:35,859
Start whirling! Hurry!
Smile! Bravo, Leslie!

508
00:49:35,957 --> 00:49:40,097
Wonderful! Can you do it a little more?
Smile and whirl.

509
00:49:40,397 --> 00:49:46,096
There you go! More! Good!
Bravo! Wonderful!

510
00:49:47,037 --> 00:49:49,796
- Load the camera. Leave the same object glass.
- Ok.

511
00:49:49,797 --> 00:49:53,756
- Allow me, girls. Well?
- Out of focus.

512
00:49:53,757 --> 00:49:57,704
Christoph! Be so kind, 135th.

513
00:49:59,277 --> 00:50:00,916
- Here you go!
- Thanks.

514
00:50:00,917 --> 00:50:02,497
You're welcome.

515
00:50:03,237 --> 00:50:06,820
Attention girls!
We'll continue shooting!

516
00:50:10,437 --> 00:50:13,383
- Ready!
- Not a bad start.

517
00:50:13,957 --> 00:50:20,066
Villiers, the famous prefect, himself, his
wife, son, son-in-law - All bribetakers.

518
00:50:20,477 --> 00:50:24,697
The list is neatly made.

519
00:50:24,957 --> 00:50:27,061
Go on!

520
00:50:31,317 --> 00:50:34,516
This one is more serious!
Helmut Tiller, bribes of millions.

521
00:50:34,517 --> 00:50:37,258
Nuclear power plants, airplanes.

522
00:50:37,437 --> 00:50:41,396
Here Serrano missed.
To get this one, you have to take higher!

523
00:50:41,397 --> 00:50:43,945
Much higher.

524
00:50:51,557 --> 00:50:54,298
Something interesting?

525
00:50:56,957 --> 00:50:59,505
- Philippe?
- Yes.

526
00:51:00,237 --> 00:51:04,104
- What could he have with them in common?
- Politics.

527
00:51:18,117 --> 00:51:22,236
- If the police finds me, what shall I say?
- They mustn't find you Valerie.

528
00:51:22,237 --> 00:51:24,956
Don't leave the house.

529
00:51:24,957 --> 00:51:32,499
If you need me, call me in the office,
at home or in the car.

530
00:51:37,077 --> 00:51:40,137
Phone numbers. Good night.

531
00:51:40,237 --> 00:51:42,116
And thanks.

532
00:51:42,117 --> 00:51:45,586
Good night. See you.

533
00:53:05,637 --> 00:53:09,196
- Taxi! Taxi! Help!
- I'm going to the park.

534
00:53:09,197 --> 00:53:11,699
Taxi! Help!

535
00:53:15,957 --> 00:53:19,096
Help me!
They are chasing me.

536
00:53:32,997 --> 00:53:37,661
The last express train to downtown 
leaves in 3 minutes.

537
00:53:37,877 --> 00:53:42,336
I repeat, the last express train
to downtown leaves in 3 minutes.

538
00:53:55,157 --> 00:53:58,581
Hello?! Valerie, what's the matter?

539
00:54:47,237 --> 00:54:49,978
Where are you going, miss, don't leave us!

540
00:54:54,837 --> 00:54:57,196
Some soldiers were passing bye.

541
00:54:57,197 --> 00:55:01,224
I told them that I was being followed
and thought of something.

542
00:55:01,357 --> 00:55:06,226
The glass on the door was broken.
Maybe it had been thieves?

543
00:55:06,717 --> 00:55:11,779
I'm going crazy, but now I'm fine.

544
00:55:11,837 --> 00:55:14,498
Fasten your seat belt.

545
00:56:07,877 --> 00:56:11,062
You just love to kill each other.

546
00:56:13,797 --> 00:56:15,901
Sorry!

547
00:56:16,997 --> 00:56:20,466
I'll take you to a safe place.

548
00:56:21,437 --> 00:56:25,339
That's it. In 5 minutes
you'll be drowned in sleep.

549
00:56:25,637 --> 00:56:27,676
- Do you need pyjamas?
- No thank you!

550
00:56:27,677 --> 00:56:29,622
- Good night!
- Good night!

551
00:56:31,157 --> 00:56:34,296
- There. Have some rest!
- I'm already asleep.

552
00:56:44,437 --> 00:56:47,781
She's sweet and courteous.

553
00:56:50,557 --> 00:56:55,346
You got it wrong.
She was Philippe's girlfriend.

554
00:56:56,717 --> 00:57:04,305
Philippe. What can you do?
Philippe liked only beauties.

555
00:57:04,757 --> 00:57:09,341
And Christiane was beautiful
before she started drinking.

556
00:57:09,797 --> 00:57:12,196
He was a good, but not serious guy.

557
00:57:12,197 --> 00:57:16,258
Paul, let's talk about something else.
For instance, about you.

558
00:57:16,357 --> 00:57:22,036
- When did we see each other last time?
- I think 3 years ago. On Christmas.

559
00:57:22,037 --> 00:57:23,916
You didn't become younger.

560
00:57:23,917 --> 00:57:27,181
Yes, but at least it's not the drunkenness
that ruins my health, no!

561
00:57:27,477 --> 00:57:30,218
Art burns me!

562
00:57:31,317 --> 00:57:35,617
You don't imagine,
how difficult it is to draw for kiddies.

563
00:57:36,117 --> 00:57:40,196
They want to see something new all the time,
something unusual.

564
00:57:40,197 --> 00:57:43,596
Will you still be drawing dogs 
and cats in 2000?

565
00:57:43,597 --> 00:57:44,996
Why not?

566
00:57:44,997 --> 00:57:49,116
Michelangelo portrayed 
bearded men all his life.

567
00:57:49,117 --> 00:57:51,756
God, Moses, they're all bearded.

568
00:57:51,757 --> 00:57:56,102
You know what I'm going to tell you?
I'll be back to painting someday.

569
00:57:56,197 --> 00:57:58,676
- Like Michelangelo?
- Don't laugh!

570
00:57:58,677 --> 00:58:04,297
I'm absolutely serious. Drawing for 
myself like Sezanne and Van Gogh.

571
00:58:04,837 --> 00:58:07,578
I've been thinking about it a lot recently.

572
00:58:08,597 --> 00:58:11,338
I even believe in what I say.

573
00:58:13,077 --> 00:58:19,937
- Perhaps I should enter politics.
- Maybe, well go on, I'm listening.

574
00:58:20,957 --> 00:58:24,745
And on what Philippe tripped?

575
00:58:26,597 --> 00:58:32,023
You know, on in such a position you can
provide services, and in return receive thanks.

576
00:58:32,677 --> 00:58:34,756
However. 
Because of that he got killed.

577
00:58:34,757 --> 00:58:39,136
- In gratitude?
- Don't.

578
00:58:42,157 --> 00:58:43,636
Take care.

579
00:58:43,637 --> 00:58:45,876
- Are you angry with me?
- For what?

580
00:58:45,877 --> 00:58:47,956
For Philippe.
I shouldn't blurt.

581
00:58:47,957 --> 00:58:50,116
You were friends,
you knew him better than I did.

582
00:58:50,117 --> 00:58:52,744
Everything's OK Paul.

583
00:59:04,997 --> 00:59:08,476
Xav! Let the girl stay longer
at my place!

584
00:59:08,477 --> 00:59:11,138
At least I'll be seeing you.

585
00:59:19,797 --> 00:59:24,381
Hello? Does Monsieur show up?
Finally!

586
00:59:24,677 --> 00:59:27,676
Are you alive?
I called all night.

587
00:59:27,677 --> 00:59:30,876
I thought you had left me
without saying good-bye.

588
00:59:30,877 --> 00:59:35,382
Sure, that's my style!
Dinner tonight?

589
00:59:37,357 --> 00:59:39,316
I'll call you back. Somebody came.

590
00:59:39,317 --> 00:59:42,596
Don't hang up, if I hear shooting,
then I won't roast your portion.

591
00:59:42,597 --> 00:59:44,940
Very witty!

592
00:59:49,077 --> 00:59:51,556
- Who's there?
- Monsieur Marechal?

593
00:59:51,557 --> 00:59:55,936
- Yes? - Monsieur Fondari sent us, 
he has business to discuss with you.

594
00:59:57,597 --> 00:59:58,796
What is the phone for?

595
00:59:58,797 --> 01:00:02,356
Monsieur Fondari is sure that
phones have ears and too many.

596
01:00:02,357 --> 01:00:03,556
I'll talk to him.

597
01:00:03,557 --> 01:00:06,298
- May I come in, Monsieur Marechal?
- No.

598
01:00:06,957 --> 01:00:08,556
Unique sculpture of

599
01:00:08,557 --> 01:00:13,276
How much did I pay? 30 million.
But it's worth 35 in the shop window.

600
01:00:13,277 --> 01:00:15,716
all from the collection of Empress Xu.

601
01:00:15,717 --> 01:00:20,756
- To me it says nothing
- Me neither. But there are consultants.

602
01:00:20,757 --> 01:00:24,579
- And do you know Schliben, the expert?
- No.

603
01:00:24,957 --> 01:00:27,743
I never thought I would fly up so high.

604
01:00:28,757 --> 01:00:32,818
In our family I was the twelfth child.

605
01:00:33,037 --> 01:00:37,236
I started working at baker's when I was 8.
Can you imagine?

606
01:00:37,237 --> 01:00:40,396
When I was 20
I burst into the bank with a gun.

607
01:00:40,397 --> 01:00:44,822
I'm the most honourable client of that bank
now.

608
01:00:45,877 --> 01:00:52,577
I was making my way with fists, and those that
resisted I was sending to the better world.

609
01:00:53,717 --> 01:00:56,299
Whom for instance?

610
01:00:56,957 --> 01:01:00,316
Sorry, I understand much better
with concrete examples.

611
01:01:00,317 --> 01:01:05,106
No,no, no! I didn't kill Serrano!
And my men had nothing to do with that.

612
01:01:05,637 --> 01:01:08,036
- You can believe me.
- And Philippe?

613
01:01:08,037 --> 01:01:11,756
We could buy him.
Why should we kill him?!

614
01:01:11,757 --> 01:01:15,977
Oh, by the way, I don't understand,
what do you want from his mistress?

615
01:01:16,477 --> 01:01:21,016
That girl is celebrity now.
Cops are pissed off.

616
01:01:24,077 --> 01:01:28,502
Where did you hide her?
And who's got the diary now?

617
01:01:29,877 --> 01:01:33,676
The same questions, only a bit earlier,
I was asked by commissioner Moreau.

618
01:01:33,677 --> 01:01:38,625
- But to me, Xav, you have to tell the truth.
- Why is that?

619
01:01:39,397 --> 01:01:44,236
Because I can cause you bigger
trouble that the commissioner.

620
01:01:44,237 --> 01:01:46,295
We'll see.

621
01:01:47,157 --> 01:01:51,516
Look, Xav, I can see you're going
to work for yourself.

622
01:01:51,517 --> 01:01:55,236
And that's dangerous
and very risky.

623
01:01:55,237 --> 01:01:59,916
You're overestimating your opportunities.
You better keep working as an assistant.

624
01:01:59,917 --> 01:02:06,982
- Less money, but life of ease.
- Thanks for the advice.

625
01:02:08,837 --> 01:02:12,943
I'll soon be 50, son.
I'm rich.

626
01:02:13,597 --> 01:02:17,436
Still I depend on people 
that can destroy me.

627
01:02:17,437 --> 01:02:20,178
Crush and destroy.

628
01:02:20,717 --> 01:02:24,836
They instructed me to return 
Serrano's diary at all costs.

629
01:02:24,837 --> 01:02:26,836
At any cost

630
01:02:26,837 --> 01:02:30,676
But I would not want to spill blood.

631
01:02:30,677 --> 01:02:34,021
Do you have the diary?
Give it to us.

632
01:02:36,957 --> 01:02:43,942
You? Interesting News!
So you're just a minion?

633
01:02:44,157 --> 01:02:47,376
An executive and 
obedient assistant.

634
01:02:48,357 --> 01:02:50,436
I don't have the diary,
but if I had it...

635
01:02:50,437 --> 01:02:54,816
- You're playing with fire, Xav!
- Not yet.

636
01:02:55,037 --> 01:02:58,620
First you have to be 
instructed by your master.

637
01:03:23,757 --> 01:03:26,225
I won't be long.

638
01:03:41,837 --> 01:03:45,236
Monsieur Marechal has two visitors now.

639
01:03:45,237 --> 01:03:47,659
I'll wait.

640
01:03:49,157 --> 01:03:50,956
- Monsieur Marechal?
- Yes?

641
01:03:50,957 --> 01:03:54,984
- Monsieur Lacor is here.
- Ask him to come to Mr. Dubaye's cabinet.

642
01:04:16,357 --> 01:04:18,876
- Master himself!
- Hello Xav!

643
01:04:18,877 --> 01:04:21,618
- How is Christiane?
- Wonderful.

644
01:04:22,077 --> 01:04:26,956
She's fine, she's holding on.
I'm still her attorney.

645
01:04:26,957 --> 01:04:27,876
Sure.

646
01:04:27,877 --> 01:04:30,504
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

647
01:04:31,877 --> 01:04:36,177
The Dutch contract is signed,
I'll send copies to you and Christiane.

648
01:04:36,357 --> 01:04:37,276
OK.

649
01:04:37,277 --> 01:04:40,257
- Do you have any other affairs with me?
- No.

650
01:04:41,397 --> 01:04:42,476
Oh, I completely forgot.

651
01:04:42,477 --> 01:04:46,156
I brought to you an invitation to the
exhibition.

652
01:04:46,157 --> 01:04:50,076
There! The exhibition is called
"French quality"

653
01:04:50,077 --> 01:04:53,156
Thanks, you're very kind,
but I have a lot to do.

654
01:04:53,157 --> 01:04:54,956
It's important.

655
01:04:54,957 --> 01:04:59,556
Influential people would like to meet with
you.

656
01:04:59,557 --> 01:05:04,236
- We can do that in the office.
- They want to meet you by a chance.

657
01:05:04,237 --> 01:05:07,836
- I'll try, but I can't promise.
- Come, you won't regret.

658
01:05:07,837 --> 01:05:10,476
Oh, by the way.

659
01:05:10,477 --> 01:05:13,556
You may not know that I'm a member of
society.

660
01:05:13,557 --> 01:05:17,424
- That's what it is? What? Salvation army?
- No.

661
01:05:20,437 --> 01:05:22,876
It's an organization like Masonic Lodge.

662
01:05:22,877 --> 01:05:25,756
Members of this society 
must help each other.

663
01:05:25,757 --> 01:05:30,396
- And so on. Didn't you understand?
- No, I didn't.

664
01:05:30,397 --> 01:05:33,076
- You just don't want to.
- I'm doing enough listening to you!

665
01:05:33,077 --> 01:05:36,556
Now there can't be any doubts that soon
everything will start swinging in the country.

666
01:05:36,557 --> 01:05:40,716
If we're talking about the same country, then
everything has been swinging in it since Valois.

667
01:05:40,717 --> 01:05:43,596
It's too right!
We have no illusions.

668
01:05:43,597 --> 01:05:45,636
Collectivists can not be allowed to come
closer to the pie.

669
01:05:45,637 --> 01:05:47,676
They'll grab a piece and won't give it back!

670
01:05:47,677 --> 01:05:49,796
Then society must take measures.

671
01:05:49,797 --> 01:05:53,876
Buy weapons, build attendance, transfer
money to Switzerland.

672
01:05:53,877 --> 01:05:58,036
We still have time, but the organization,
preparation,

673
01:05:58,037 --> 01:06:01,116
- establishment of funds.
- Yes.

674
01:06:01,117 --> 01:06:04,156
- Are you their treasurer?
- You guessed correctly.

675
01:06:04,157 --> 01:06:06,396
Leadership appointed me, and I'm very
flattered.

676
01:06:06,397 --> 01:06:08,556
This is surely a sign of confidence.

677
01:06:08,557 --> 01:06:11,076
By the way, if you need it,
I have all the money.

678
01:06:11,077 --> 01:06:13,636
Thanks, but I'm not going to enter into any
society.

679
01:06:13,637 --> 01:06:16,076
- Not my style.
- Think first.

680
01:06:16,077 --> 01:06:17,636
- OK!
- See you in the evening.

681
01:06:17,637 --> 01:06:19,436
I didn't promise anything.

682
01:06:19,437 --> 01:06:23,623
Ok, but I promised them
that you will come.

683
01:06:24,997 --> 01:06:27,738
Don't ever promise on my behalf.

684
01:06:28,117 --> 01:06:31,461
- I might really let you down!
- How?

685
01:06:36,837 --> 01:06:39,996
Between ourselves, Lucien,
do you know what I'd love to do?

686
01:06:39,997 --> 01:06:41,862
No.

687
01:06:42,637 --> 01:06:46,857
Hit you in the face!
Good-bye.

688
01:06:51,877 --> 01:06:54,265
Sorry.

689
01:07:00,917 --> 01:07:03,658
You haven't visit us for
a long time Monsieur Marechal.

690
01:07:03,757 --> 01:07:06,116
- Good afternoon!
- Good afternoon!

691
01:07:06,117 --> 01:07:07,316
Who's here?

692
01:07:07,317 --> 01:07:11,316
A bunch of politicians, several bankers,
clowns, countess, whores.

693
01:07:11,317 --> 01:07:15,901
Overall, french quality,
but fortunately there are some friends.

694
01:07:15,917 --> 01:07:18,676
You know, when I learned about Philippe,
I felt bad.

695
01:07:18,677 --> 01:07:21,338
Thanks. You're very nice.

696
01:07:21,837 --> 01:07:23,396
- Hello, Xav!
- Hello, Armel!

697
01:07:23,397 --> 01:07:27,756
I thought you won't be coming.
I was already going to call you. Shall we go?

698
01:07:27,757 --> 01:07:29,796
I wanted to come long ago, but now
everything's on me.

699
01:07:29,797 --> 01:07:31,876
- Armel!
- Come on in. I'll be right over.

700
01:07:31,877 --> 01:07:34,902
- I won't be coming tomorrow.
- Why?

701
01:07:44,717 --> 01:07:46,980
Excuse me.

702
01:07:48,317 --> 01:07:51,058
One beer, please!

703
01:08:02,957 --> 01:08:05,140
Xav!

704
01:08:08,117 --> 01:08:10,996
Hello, Xav! Nice to see you.

705
01:08:10,997 --> 01:08:14,739
They're waiting for us.
I'll go and tell them you're here.

706
01:08:17,357 --> 01:08:19,396
No need to sprinkle ashes on your head.

707
01:08:19,397 --> 01:08:21,676
- Am I shocking you?
- It's a bad taste.

708
01:08:21,677 --> 01:08:23,716
I don't give a shit what people will say.

709
01:08:23,717 --> 01:08:25,916
Get a grip on yourself.

710
01:08:25,917 --> 01:08:27,956
Don't ask me to act like an inconsolable
widow

711
01:08:27,957 --> 01:08:31,221
of people's elected representative.

712
01:08:31,517 --> 01:08:34,956
- This is what I'm going to say...
- Ok, say it, only quietly.

713
01:08:34,957 --> 01:08:39,876
Sure!
If you ask me, I may say it quietly.

714
01:08:39,877 --> 01:08:42,756
During the life of Philip
I was betrayed wife,

715
01:08:42,757 --> 01:08:46,956
but now, after his death
I'm his widow.

716
01:08:46,957 --> 01:08:50,301
- Alone in both cases.
- And the attorney?

717
01:08:50,437 --> 01:08:52,636
What are you talking about?!

718
01:08:52,637 --> 01:08:55,378
When you don't get what you want,
you take what you can.

719
01:08:55,437 --> 01:08:57,476
If I were rich

720
01:08:57,477 --> 01:09:02,619
would you marry me? Tell me.
- You shouldn't drink.

721
01:09:05,117 --> 01:09:07,876
If I get Serrano's diary,
I'll be rich.

722
01:09:07,877 --> 01:09:10,663
Please, shut up!

723
01:09:15,157 --> 01:09:22,745
- Listen, how much do you want, Xav?
- Christiane! Xav, they're waiting for us.

724
01:09:22,917 --> 01:09:25,226
I'm coming.

725
01:09:26,837 --> 01:09:29,385
Ok

726
01:09:38,677 --> 01:09:42,036
Mr. general manager, let me 
introduce you Monsieur Marechal.

727
01:09:42,037 --> 01:09:44,636
- Monsieur Lansac!
- Could you please excuse me?

728
01:09:44,637 --> 01:09:49,346
Take a seat, please, Monsieur Marechal,
very nice to meet you.

729
01:09:49,557 --> 01:09:51,396
We're fellow sufferers.

730
01:09:51,397 --> 01:09:56,345
You lost your friend in Dubaye's person,
and we lost a wonderful colleague.

731
01:09:57,117 --> 01:09:59,156
You'll surely agree with me,
Monsieur Marechal,

732
01:09:59,157 --> 01:10:03,024
that our main aim is
to save his reputation.

733
01:10:04,677 --> 01:10:08,579
The aim is noble,
but by what means?

734
01:10:08,677 --> 01:10:13,396
Nothing complicated! Destroy all the
traces and forget about everything.

735
01:10:13,397 --> 01:10:16,916
Simple solution! However I'm 
sure it's not the best way out.

736
01:10:16,917 --> 01:10:22,716
No, no, no, you're surely right,
not only the materials compromising Dubaye

737
01:10:22,717 --> 01:10:29,383
must be destroyed, we're also
obligated to finish the clique of scoundrels.

738
01:10:29,997 --> 01:10:33,596
The thought of the pact which we are
about to make, they are already shaking.

739
01:10:33,597 --> 01:10:36,338
I think it's premature.

740
01:10:36,437 --> 01:10:38,476
I fully share the feelings of Monsieur Lansac,

741
01:10:38,477 --> 01:10:43,036
his desire to save Philippe's reputation,
and to curb the criminal clique.

742
01:10:43,037 --> 01:10:49,260
but, sorry, I don't understand what kind
of role in this campaign I'll be playing.

743
01:10:49,477 --> 01:10:54,636
A very small one, Monsieur Marechal,
nothing special will be demanded from you.

744
01:10:54,637 --> 01:11:02,179
I'm not asking you to give me Serrano's diary.
But perhaps in there is also mentioned...

745
01:11:06,557 --> 01:11:09,476
In that case I would ask you
to give me the pages,

746
01:11:09,477 --> 01:11:13,856
in which the name of
that personality is included.

747
01:11:14,317 --> 01:11:17,276
- And why?
- To show them.

748
01:11:17,277 --> 01:11:20,476
Not to everybody, but only to those
that should see it.

749
01:11:20,477 --> 01:11:23,756
And of course! That personality 
won't exist any longer!

750
01:11:23,757 --> 01:11:27,420
He will be discredited!
Scrapped!

751
01:11:27,437 --> 01:11:32,055
I'm asking you!
Please be so kind!

752
01:11:33,157 --> 01:11:35,756
If I had it,
I'd be happy to give it to you.

753
01:11:35,757 --> 01:11:37,986
But Xav.

754
01:11:38,197 --> 01:11:41,196
That firm Sozhoka you're running,

755
01:11:41,197 --> 01:11:45,236
in which Monsieur Lacor is the legal adviser,
would probably like to expand the market.

756
01:11:45,237 --> 01:11:49,821
For instance, have an access 
to Luxemburg, Germany.

757
01:11:49,917 --> 01:11:51,956
The same thing that my father
used to call 'milch cow',

758
01:11:51,957 --> 01:11:55,956
is now called European four,
nine, ten...

759
01:11:55,957 --> 01:11:58,459
Possible combinations.

760
01:11:58,597 --> 01:12:01,276
I will not deny that,
even without having your wits,

761
01:12:01,277 --> 01:12:04,940
I'm earning a lot.
And you.

762
01:12:05,557 --> 01:12:08,298
I imagine how much you'll expand.

763
01:12:08,317 --> 01:12:11,980
- How much do you want, Xav?
- Excuse me?

764
01:12:12,517 --> 01:12:15,577
No. I'm sorry. I was talking to myself.

765
01:12:18,037 --> 01:12:20,196
Well, I have to go to present awards.

766
01:12:20,197 --> 01:12:25,896
And you think all to the mustard,
but do it quickly.

767
01:12:31,237 --> 01:12:35,059
There's something that
Lansac didn't tell you.

768
01:12:35,157 --> 01:12:40,836
We need the diary, but the most important thing
is that it shouldn't get into its owner's hands.

769
01:12:40,837 --> 01:12:43,578
What owner?
Serrano's dead.

770
01:12:43,717 --> 01:12:47,778
But his post still remains,
and another person is holding it.

771
01:12:49,517 --> 01:12:53,544
Look, Xav, I wouldn't want
to see you hit by a bus.

772
01:12:54,797 --> 01:12:59,716
I'll try to gain time, I'll tell them
that you and me carry on negotiations.

773
01:12:59,717 --> 01:13:03,823
But after that they won't
stand on ceremony with you.

774
01:13:04,237 --> 01:13:07,900
For now the general manager is willing to
help

775
01:13:08,437 --> 01:13:12,498
Tell him that I was touched
by his concern for my well-being

776
01:13:13,357 --> 01:13:15,620
Good-bye.

777
01:13:21,837 --> 01:13:24,956
Xav, I am getting bored.
Let's go to my place.

778
01:13:24,957 --> 01:13:26,116
Why?

779
01:13:26,117 --> 01:13:30,417
Tell me.
Do you want to know who killed Philippe?

780
01:13:31,157 --> 01:13:34,316
Christiane, I was looking for you.
Excuse me, Xav.

781
01:13:34,317 --> 01:13:37,058
You coming?

782
01:13:39,197 --> 01:13:40,996
Dear friends! Attention!

783
01:13:40,997 --> 01:13:43,036
'The best exhibit' awards

784
01:13:43,037 --> 01:13:46,939
will be presented by general manager,
Monsieur Lansac.

785
01:13:48,237 --> 01:13:51,316
Were you getting instructed by the master?
So what did he say?

786
01:13:51,317 --> 01:13:53,356
- Who?
- General manager.

787
01:13:53,357 --> 01:13:54,996
What were you talking about?

788
01:13:54,997 --> 01:13:57,636
About old-age pension
and future of youth.

789
01:13:57,637 --> 01:14:01,396
You're getting on my nerves.
I don't understand. What's wrong with you?

790
01:14:01,397 --> 01:14:03,676
- You were always with us!
- With Philippe.

791
01:14:03,677 --> 01:14:06,463
- I was his boss.
- But not mine.

792
01:14:06,597 --> 01:14:09,338
- I will be yours too.
- We'll see.

793
01:14:11,157 --> 01:14:13,396
Why are you jibbing so much?

794
01:14:13,397 --> 01:14:15,916
In the most difficult situations
I always covered Philipe.

795
01:14:15,917 --> 01:14:22,105
You know that. And that wasn't easy.
But the rates increased.

796
01:14:22,957 --> 01:14:26,796
Serrano, Philippe, your Algerian.
Who's next?

797
01:14:26,797 --> 01:14:29,538
I warned you.

798
01:14:30,957 --> 01:14:34,984
And now, friends, general manager,
Monsieur Lansac.

799
01:16:58,237 --> 01:17:00,978
You scared me.

800
01:17:01,997 --> 01:17:06,263
You... you could come in like all
decent people do. Ring at the door.

801
01:17:06,637 --> 01:17:11,016
How did you come in?
Why do you keep silent?

802
01:17:12,437 --> 01:17:15,656
You used to be more talkative.

803
01:17:17,957 --> 01:17:20,698
What do you want?

804
01:17:20,997 --> 01:17:25,137
You wanted to scare me?
Well you did! And that's enough!

805
01:17:25,277 --> 01:17:29,497
Take a seat!
Tell me. What do you want from me?

806
01:17:30,037 --> 01:17:32,459
What are you doing?

807
01:17:35,557 --> 01:17:38,696
Can't we safely negotiate with you?

808
01:17:38,757 --> 01:17:43,341
I'm sure there are no issues that can't be
settled.

809
01:17:44,157 --> 01:17:46,796
Keep in mind that I'm expecting someone,

810
01:17:46,797 --> 01:17:49,583
and do you know what happens
if he'll find you here?

811
01:17:51,837 --> 01:17:56,262
Enough! I'm warning you!
It'll cost you dear!

812
01:17:58,677 --> 01:18:01,463
Leave me, I'll scream!

813
01:18:05,277 --> 01:18:08,826
I'll call the police! Help! Help me!

814
01:18:51,397 --> 01:18:54,536
Nothing surprising,
from the 8th floor.

815
01:18:56,517 --> 01:18:59,099
And her husband too recently.

816
01:19:51,797 --> 01:19:54,756
Three pages.
Yes, from Serrano's diary.

817
01:19:54,757 --> 01:19:59,785
Don't take it if you don't want to.
Exceptional case.

818
01:20:00,957 --> 01:20:02,356
So what?

819
01:20:02,357 --> 01:20:06,036
Tomorrow morning, your competitors
will print in their newspapers that...

820
01:20:06,037 --> 01:20:10,496
If you want...
I thought so.

821
01:20:10,637 --> 01:20:15,824
You'll receive the package in 2 hours.
Whom to address?

822
01:20:17,197 --> 01:20:19,116
Dubreuil.
OK, thanks.

823
01:20:19,117 --> 01:20:23,476
- Do you realize what you're doing, Xav?
- I realize what they can do.

824
01:20:23,477 --> 01:20:27,140
Xavier! It's ready. Take a look.

825
01:20:31,237 --> 01:20:33,396
Choose any.

826
01:20:33,397 --> 01:20:36,636
No surprises here,
you know what you're pulling out

827
01:20:36,637 --> 01:20:39,423
Different scales.

828
01:20:42,637 --> 01:20:46,698
Dupere!
Look, Dupere is a moralist!

829
01:20:47,237 --> 01:20:49,276
He spoke out against long hair.

830
01:20:49,277 --> 01:20:54,385
Against abortion and strip,
but not against the arms trade.

831
01:20:54,637 --> 01:20:55,516
Dupere!

832
01:20:55,517 --> 01:20:58,156
- How many copies shall I print?
- Ten.

833
01:20:58,157 --> 01:21:02,536
We'll choose the three most prominent
villains.

834
01:21:02,717 --> 01:21:05,458
You'll destroy them this way.

835
01:21:05,957 --> 01:21:09,796
- And what if these people only...
- Made a mistake?

836
01:21:09,797 --> 01:21:14,356
May be they did wrong?
In that case, your act is very cruel.

837
01:21:14,357 --> 01:21:18,065
- Monstrous.
- And what did they do to Philippe?

838
01:21:18,237 --> 01:21:21,137
And was Philippe better than them?
Without prejudice.

839
01:21:21,677 --> 01:21:25,465
I don't want to be unprejudiced.
it's just an empty word.

840
01:21:26,117 --> 01:21:28,062
Dupere.

841
01:21:30,637 --> 01:21:33,617
One, two, three.

842
01:21:34,557 --> 01:21:36,236
Three into each envelope.

843
01:21:36,237 --> 01:21:39,236
- And why not four?
- Philippe, Christiane, Kebir.

844
01:21:39,237 --> 01:21:45,858
- Is Serrano still alive?
- I have my own count.

845
01:21:49,477 --> 01:21:52,676
Latest news!
Regarding Serrano case!

846
01:21:52,677 --> 01:21:55,836
Last night an unknown person phoned
the editorial offices of the Paris newspapers

847
01:21:55,837 --> 01:21:59,396
and offered three pages from 
the notorious diary.

848
01:21:59,397 --> 01:22:02,516
It begs the question of who 
the unknown person is?

849
01:22:02,517 --> 01:22:05,156
These pages expose 
the improper actions

850
01:22:05,157 --> 01:22:08,103
of famous political figures.

851
01:22:10,477 --> 01:22:13,036
Everyone who saw 
Madame Dubaye said that

852
01:22:13,037 --> 01:22:16,984
she was not acting like 
an inconsolable widow.

853
01:22:17,877 --> 01:22:21,983
I could understand if she took
an overdose of sleeping pills.

854
01:22:22,437 --> 01:22:25,178
But such a suicide.

855
01:22:26,077 --> 01:22:28,977
It's more like a pretence.

856
01:22:30,917 --> 01:22:34,784
Pretences of that kind are easily
in the spirit of your department.

857
01:22:38,437 --> 01:22:42,065
I don't know where you got such information.

858
01:22:42,117 --> 01:22:49,056
Madame Dubaye left at 12, and 
you almost followed hard on her heels.

859
01:22:50,597 --> 01:22:52,436
Coincidence.

860
01:22:52,437 --> 01:22:54,939
That's what you're saying.

861
01:22:57,357 --> 01:23:02,339
Mr. Lacor accompanied Madam Dubaye
to the door of the house.

862
01:23:03,437 --> 01:23:04,356
That's what he says.

863
01:23:04,357 --> 01:23:07,516
So, we have already 2 suspects.

864
01:23:07,517 --> 01:23:12,156
- Well, we can find more.
- But you prefer me?

865
01:23:12,157 --> 01:23:15,296
Yes, it's much easier.

866
01:23:16,917 --> 01:23:21,103
Here I have the testimony of
Maixant Lucien, the headwaiter

867
01:23:22,957 --> 01:23:26,076
I heard Madam Dubaye
telling Monsieur Marechal

868
01:23:26,077 --> 01:23:29,979
"If I get Serrano's diary,
I'll be reach"

869
01:23:30,677 --> 01:23:33,463
You left the club 5 minutes after she did.

870
01:23:34,917 --> 01:23:38,580
You were seen outside her house.

871
01:23:39,637 --> 01:23:41,946
Isn't that enough for you?

872
01:23:44,517 --> 01:23:49,596
I think it will be more than
enough for the investigator.

873
01:23:49,597 --> 01:23:54,181
Excuse me, colleague! I was told 
Monsieur Marechal is in your office.

874
01:23:54,357 --> 01:23:56,396
He'll stay at whole allowance.

875
01:23:56,397 --> 01:23:59,946
Only not in your department.

876
01:24:00,117 --> 01:24:05,225
Investigator Fave just signed the 
warrant for Mr. Marechal's arrest.

877
01:24:07,877 --> 01:24:09,956
I'm not going to prejudge
the results of the investigation

878
01:24:09,957 --> 01:24:13,156
but I'm still investigating 
the Dubaye case.

879
01:24:13,157 --> 01:24:15,116
There are 2 Dubaye cases.

880
01:24:15,117 --> 01:24:20,304
I wonder by what miracle you're going
to separate them from each other?

881
01:24:20,717 --> 01:24:24,076
The investigator won't need 
a miracle for that.

882
01:24:24,077 --> 01:24:27,899
His conclusions are based on pure logic.

883
01:24:28,517 --> 01:24:31,796
Deputy Dubaye kills Serrano
and steals the diary.

884
01:24:31,797 --> 01:24:34,516
A few days later
Monsieur Marechal kills Dubaye

885
01:24:34,517 --> 01:24:37,702
and sends part of it to the 
newspaper editorial offices.

886
01:24:38,557 --> 01:24:39,676
There!

887
01:24:39,677 --> 01:24:45,058
The investigator apprehends that the
publicity will affect other people.

888
01:24:45,717 --> 01:24:49,345
Perhaps even those who are 
above any suspicion.

889
01:24:50,517 --> 01:24:55,135
Murders are investigated in the criminal
police, so this is my merchandise.

890
01:24:57,197 --> 01:24:59,596
Don't you think that now in the eyes of the
authorities'

891
01:24:59,597 --> 01:25:02,596
the main point is not the murder.

892
01:25:02,597 --> 01:25:05,338
There is another aspect of the issue.

893
01:25:06,037 --> 01:25:08,220
Judge for yourself.

894
01:25:08,437 --> 01:25:11,596
Libel, disinformation,

895
01:25:11,597 --> 01:25:15,116
exposing to the detriment of national
interests.

896
01:25:15,117 --> 01:25:19,656
That is, an attempt on the 
internal and external safety

897
01:25:20,357 --> 01:25:22,700
My merchandise!

898
01:25:24,197 --> 01:25:26,938
Two departments are fighting for me.

899
01:25:27,837 --> 01:25:30,578
Please come with me to make an arrest.

900
01:25:41,677 --> 01:25:44,862
Nice to see such a primer, such a zeal.

901
01:25:50,637 --> 01:25:53,316
Why did you pull me out of his clutches?

902
01:25:53,317 --> 01:25:55,716
I... Please.

903
01:25:55,717 --> 01:25:58,458
Frankly speaking, I'm very pleased.

904
01:25:58,997 --> 01:26:02,596
So, two departments argue,
and the murderer of Philippe is at large.

905
01:26:02,597 --> 01:26:04,796
You know that I didn't kill him!

906
01:26:04,797 --> 01:26:08,796
I know that better than anyone, because 
I am the auhor of the official version.

907
01:26:08,797 --> 01:26:13,222
Dubaye was killed by his mistress, 
of course, who is hiding from the police.

908
01:26:14,637 --> 01:26:19,276
Yes, by the way, don't you think
it's time for her to show up?

909
01:26:19,277 --> 01:26:21,676
At least for a time.

910
01:26:21,677 --> 01:26:24,476
- And Christiane Dubaye?
- Despair, hopelessness!

911
01:26:24,477 --> 01:26:27,582
The version of newspapers suits me.

912
01:26:31,717 --> 01:26:34,458
Hello, Mr. Prosecutor.

913
01:26:35,237 --> 01:26:37,978
Yes, Monsieur Marechal's with me.

914
01:26:39,717 --> 01:26:41,696
One moment!

915
01:26:47,037 --> 01:26:50,236
- Hello?!
- Monsieur Marechal? Hello!

916
01:26:50,237 --> 01:26:53,476
There's a person here with me,
who would like to talk to you.

917
01:26:53,477 --> 01:26:56,423
Pass the phone to 
commissioner Perne after.

918
01:27:02,557 --> 01:27:04,979
Please.

919
01:27:07,197 --> 01:27:10,541
Monsieur Marechal?
It's Tomski.

920
01:27:11,157 --> 01:27:16,742
I think the moment has come
when we should meet again.

921
01:27:17,397 --> 01:27:19,436
On the day after tomorrow 
I'm leaving France.

922
01:27:19,437 --> 01:27:22,436
but before leaving I'll be glad 
to have you here at my place.

923
01:27:22,437 --> 01:27:27,385
I am organizing a hunt for my friends
at eight o'clock in the morning.

924
01:27:27,917 --> 01:27:33,138
Lamotte-Beuvron, yes, yes.
Thirty kilometers after Orleans.

925
01:27:34,397 --> 01:27:36,376
I know.

926
01:27:36,797 --> 01:27:42,257
All this is excellent.
But there is one obstacle, I'm under arrest.

927
01:27:44,317 --> 01:27:45,977
Yes.

928
01:27:48,997 --> 01:27:51,704
I'm giving the phone 
to the Commissioner.

929
01:27:52,357 --> 01:27:54,620
Prosecutor!

930
01:27:56,917 --> 01:28:01,422
Hello? 
Yes, Monsieur Prosecutor!

931
01:28:02,757 --> 01:28:06,499
Yes.
I understand, little courtesy?

932
01:28:06,877 --> 01:28:11,143
I would still like to receive 
a written order.

933
01:28:12,077 --> 01:28:16,297
Is investigator Fave aware 
of the matter? Ok.

934
01:28:16,917 --> 01:28:20,215
In that case, my compliments,
Monsieur Prosecutor!

935
01:28:25,877 --> 01:28:29,983
I can only wish you good hunting,
Monsieur Marechal.

936
01:28:30,037 --> 01:28:35,418
- Who's that Tomski?
- As you can see, a person of influence.

937
01:28:36,557 --> 01:28:42,336
I rescued you from one wolf,
and they attacked in packs.

938
01:28:43,477 --> 01:28:49,301
The circle closes, and they will do 
everything possible to seize the prey.

939
01:28:50,797 --> 01:28:53,777
You're free.

940
01:29:00,117 --> 01:29:02,665
Good-bye.

941
01:29:02,717 --> 01:29:04,502
Xav!

942
01:29:07,237 --> 01:29:10,076
I know that influential people
are looking for contact with you.

943
01:29:10,077 --> 01:29:11,996
My friends are ready to do anything.

944
01:29:11,997 --> 01:29:15,785
Keep in mind, anything,
that your meeting did not take place.

945
01:29:18,077 --> 01:29:20,436
Take note of this.

946
01:29:20,437 --> 01:29:23,178
- Monsieur Lacor!
- Coming!

947
01:30:34,317 --> 01:30:37,058
Calmed down, Monsieur Marechal?

948
01:30:40,837 --> 01:30:42,876
- Hey, Jacques!
- What?

949
01:30:42,877 --> 01:30:45,756
You crushed him great!

950
01:30:45,757 --> 01:30:47,476
Just like they ordered!

951
01:30:47,477 --> 01:30:50,676
I drove slowly, so that 
he could not get around me.

952
01:30:50,677 --> 01:30:52,196
Yes, I saw.

953
01:30:52,197 --> 01:30:54,938
Look! Your car!

954
01:30:55,837 --> 01:30:58,578
Take the spike out!

955
01:32:29,677 --> 01:32:34,556
- Holland-Holland?
- Do you like light weapons?

956
01:32:34,557 --> 01:32:39,539
- No.
- Then I'll advise this!

957
01:32:40,757 --> 01:32:45,500
- I don't like weapons.
- But you recognized the brand immediately.

958
01:32:46,037 --> 01:32:50,257
I know many things, but don't like them.
Same with people.

959
01:32:51,037 --> 01:32:56,556
It's worth talking about these things
and people. We'll do it after the hunt.

960
01:32:56,557 --> 01:32:59,742
- So the hunt will be organized?
- Of course.

961
01:33:02,677 --> 01:33:05,418
Please, excuse me. 
I'll be back in a moment.

962
01:33:12,157 --> 01:33:14,579
Excuse me.

963
01:33:21,077 --> 01:33:25,343
I didn't tell you anything. Not a word.
Got it?

964
01:33:26,837 --> 01:33:28,556
I didn't think you'll come.

965
01:33:28,557 --> 01:33:31,396
Monsieur Lacor!
You go with Baron de la Frene.

966
01:33:31,397 --> 01:33:33,455
Ok.

967
01:33:34,077 --> 01:33:38,104
Go, and you'll come with me!

968
01:34:23,157 --> 01:34:25,796
Didn't Philippe told you about me?

969
01:34:25,797 --> 01:34:30,142
Well, he told me about you.
He loved you very much.

970
01:34:31,037 --> 01:34:36,418
And you? You love me too?
Or are just going to love?

971
01:35:19,157 --> 01:35:23,184
A bad shot, I guess.
- First trophy.

972
01:35:23,717 --> 01:35:28,556
We should've got him earlier.
I was told what happened to you on the road.

973
01:35:28,557 --> 01:35:31,139
Own telegraph?

974
01:35:33,397 --> 01:35:36,138
Don't worry.
Nothing serious.

975
01:35:39,837 --> 01:35:41,876
We should get him to hospital.
And quickly.

976
01:35:41,877 --> 01:35:44,379
Ok, doc.

977
01:35:51,837 --> 01:35:54,676
- Is it serious?
- Charge fractions in the lumbar region.

978
01:35:54,677 --> 01:35:55,556
I see.

979
01:35:55,557 --> 01:35:58,298
If the kidneys are damaged,
then there's only one outcome.

980
01:36:08,517 --> 01:36:13,738
Doctor says it's nothing.
Everything will be fine, buddy.

981
01:36:16,437 --> 01:36:20,145
Well, of course everything will be fine.
Monsieur Marechal, it's time to go back.

982
01:36:26,517 --> 01:36:30,956
Since the sporting part is over,
let's start, dear Monsieur Marechal,

983
01:36:30,957 --> 01:36:34,699
the next phase,
more constructive.

984
01:36:34,757 --> 01:36:38,996
Now then, although you will not
find my name on any piece of paper,

985
01:36:38,997 --> 01:36:42,996
the dairy you possess -
is my property!

986
01:36:42,997 --> 01:36:45,596
Or, if you want,
I am responsible for it

987
01:36:45,597 --> 01:36:47,906
to certain people.

988
01:36:48,037 --> 01:36:51,876
Since the political climate now is very
unfavorable,

989
01:36:51,877 --> 01:36:55,676
your exposure can only harm
the interests of the country.

990
01:36:55,677 --> 01:36:58,782
- You don't have to worry about my country.
- Certainly.

991
01:36:58,917 --> 01:37:01,658
About the others too, though.

992
01:37:01,797 --> 01:37:05,076
But as long as the power has not been
captured by the Internationale of workers,

993
01:37:05,077 --> 01:37:08,660
it entirely belongs to the
Internationale of bankers.

994
01:37:08,917 --> 01:37:12,181
And it has its own laws, the new ones.

995
01:37:12,517 --> 01:37:17,784
Words as "enemies" or "allies"
have lost their significance.

996
01:37:17,837 --> 01:37:21,704
There are no friends,
only partners.

997
01:37:22,077 --> 01:37:27,981
Suppliers appeared instead of enemies.
Capital does not recognize any borders.

998
01:37:29,557 --> 01:37:31,476
Corruption doesn't either, I think.

999
01:37:31,477 --> 01:37:35,982
That's why posting Serrano's diary would not
help.

1000
01:37:36,317 --> 01:37:40,076
I'll have to resign.
Two, three political clowns will be replaced.

1001
01:37:40,077 --> 01:37:42,116
You will go to jail!

1002
01:37:42,117 --> 01:37:44,956
But essentially nothing will change.

1003
01:37:44,957 --> 01:37:47,516
Still the public opinion should not be
discounted.

1004
01:37:47,517 --> 01:37:49,476
Did Lockheed's fraud change anything?

1005
01:37:49,477 --> 01:37:50,676
And Nixon's case?

1006
01:37:50,677 --> 01:37:53,036
No, there was not a question of money,
but morality.

1007
01:37:53,037 --> 01:37:54,836
So, morality exists?

1008
01:37:54,837 --> 01:37:59,076
Well, it'll remain the scandal
of the century, Monsieur Marechal.

1009
01:37:59,077 --> 01:38:04,344
Your honesty is old-fashioned.
Now that product is not in demand.

1010
01:38:05,277 --> 01:38:11,022
I remember, your great head of the
state once called us "calves".

1011
01:38:12,397 --> 01:38:15,676
Should the calf get upset,

1012
01:38:15,677 --> 01:38:21,183
because some bureaucrat
or a minister has quickly become rich?

1013
01:38:21,557 --> 01:38:26,460
Don't you think that this may affect
the overall economic system?

1014
01:38:26,957 --> 01:38:29,796
The main thing is to produce as much as
possible.

1015
01:38:29,797 --> 01:38:33,396
Well and calves must be given
food, swill, and entertainment.

1016
01:38:33,397 --> 01:38:35,556
That is all they need.

1017
01:38:35,557 --> 01:38:38,742
And then peace and quiet will prevail in the
country.

1018
01:38:39,637 --> 01:38:44,585
- Come in.
- Gentlemen are here.

1019
01:38:45,037 --> 01:38:47,186
Ask them to come in.

1020
01:38:49,677 --> 01:38:51,996
- Hello!
- Monsieur minister!

1021
01:38:51,997 --> 01:38:56,316
Let me introduce you to Monsieur Marechal,
the perpetrator of the recent scandal.

1022
01:38:56,317 --> 01:39:01,116
It's a dirty slander!
There isn't a single word of truth in here.

1023
01:39:01,117 --> 01:39:03,116
Why don't you sue, Monsieur minister?

1024
01:39:03,117 --> 01:39:06,356
Journalists are all venal creatures.
You have to buy all of them.

1025
01:39:06,357 --> 01:39:08,276
Or invite to hunt.

1026
01:39:08,277 --> 01:39:11,996
Ok, we'll buy the diary! How much?

1027
01:39:11,997 --> 01:39:15,516
I think Monsieur Marechal's
compliancy costs 2 million.

1028
01:39:15,517 --> 01:39:18,258
- We'll discuss it.
- No need.

1029
01:39:19,077 --> 01:39:22,156
Do you have any requests, Monsieur
Marechal?

1030
01:39:22,157 --> 01:39:24,943
Only the name of Philippe's murderer.

1031
01:39:25,397 --> 01:39:29,596
If I knew it, I wouldn't tell you anyway.

1032
01:39:29,597 --> 01:39:33,066
- But I don't know who the murderer is.
- He has gone mad about it.

1033
01:39:33,357 --> 01:39:36,036
Don't you think that such condition
only leads to a dead end.

1034
01:39:36,037 --> 01:39:38,116
It's only a precondition.

1035
01:39:38,117 --> 01:39:40,436
Stop bulling!
We don't give a shit about Philippe.

1036
01:39:40,437 --> 01:39:43,756
- Whoever killed him...
- Your mission is over,

1037
01:39:43,757 --> 01:39:46,896
since Monsieur Fondari's mission
is about to begin.

1038
01:39:46,917 --> 01:39:48,516
I'm really sorry, 
you didn't listen to me.

1039
01:39:48,517 --> 01:39:49,716
- I'll stay.
- No.

1040
01:39:49,717 --> 01:39:51,356
I want to see him writhing with pain.

1041
01:39:51,357 --> 01:39:55,862
No! I'm starting to believe in
what newspapers write about you.

1042
01:39:56,077 --> 01:39:59,979
You are a worm, Monsieur minister!
A pathetic worm.

1043
01:40:01,117 --> 01:40:04,256
You've chosen an uneasy way,
Monsieur Marechal.

1044
01:40:04,757 --> 01:40:07,384
I'm really sorry.

1045
01:40:11,557 --> 01:40:15,476
- Did you book Amsterdam?
- Oh, I forgot about you, Monsieur Fondari!

1046
01:40:15,477 --> 01:40:18,263
I'll order to contact Amsterdam.

1047
01:40:20,477 --> 01:40:24,026
Now you got yourself into a mess!
I warned you!

1048
01:40:24,437 --> 01:40:29,356
But you preferred to rebel.
You could become a rich man.

1049
01:40:29,357 --> 01:40:33,516
You would be flush with money!
I told you - always keep me informed!

1050
01:40:33,517 --> 01:40:38,022
- But no, you imagined yourself a sheriff.
- I'm looking for a man who shot Philippe.

1051
01:40:38,437 --> 01:40:40,676
He won't get away from me.

1052
01:40:40,677 --> 01:40:44,817
Cops think you killed him. So do I.

1053
01:40:45,957 --> 01:40:49,076
It doesn't matter what you think at all.

1054
01:40:49,077 --> 01:40:53,343
Marseilles!
Give this man an injection.

1055
01:40:54,917 --> 01:40:57,316
It's pentabarbital of sodium.

1056
01:40:57,317 --> 01:41:03,346
Nazis used them to refresh the brain,
affects memory better than fish.

1057
01:41:04,797 --> 01:41:07,982
Could you please roll up your sleeve?

1058
01:41:28,877 --> 01:41:33,541
Hey! Come on, wake up, son!
Hurry! Guests have arrived!

1059
01:41:45,597 --> 01:41:48,987
With your face I would have become a pimp.

1060
01:42:00,957 --> 01:42:03,698
Monsieur Marechal, 
you're under arrest!

1061
01:42:04,117 --> 01:42:05,902
Durieux!

1062
01:42:11,317 --> 01:42:15,662
You are accused of embezzlement, 
perjury

1063
01:42:15,797 --> 01:42:19,095
as well as complicity 
in the murder of Serrano.

1064
01:42:24,797 --> 01:42:26,696
Take him away!

1065
01:42:27,437 --> 01:42:30,656
Monsieur Fondari, I'll be waiting
for you tomorrow in the department.

1066
01:42:31,197 --> 01:42:32,556
You still live there?

1067
01:42:32,557 --> 01:42:38,302
Yes, and my phone number is still Louvre
26-33, but I doubt the prosecutor will call me.

1068
01:42:39,197 --> 01:42:40,476
He caught a cold.

1069
01:42:40,477 --> 01:42:42,556
You should know that 
in the upper atmosphere

1070
01:42:42,557 --> 01:42:46,379
temperature is drastically reduced.

1071
01:42:46,397 --> 01:42:49,556
By the way, 
grab a blanket and clean linen.

1072
01:42:49,557 --> 01:42:51,979
Just in case.

1073
01:43:44,637 --> 01:43:46,695
This is the place!

1074
01:44:06,437 --> 01:44:09,196
Durieux! Take that car.
See you at the office.

1075
01:44:09,197 --> 01:44:11,460
Ok.

1076
01:44:17,517 --> 01:44:22,226
If there wasn't a woman by your side,
your perfect alibi wouldn't help you.

1077
01:44:22,957 --> 01:44:24,996
She helped you out.

1078
01:44:24,997 --> 01:44:28,676
- Thanks.
- I had to tell them the whole thing.

1079
01:44:28,677 --> 01:44:33,819
- You had such a long talk?
- No, we had a long typing on a typewriter.

1080
01:44:36,437 --> 01:44:39,019
Do you accuse me?

1081
01:44:43,037 --> 01:44:45,516
Did you find out who's behind all this?

1082
01:44:45,517 --> 01:44:50,156
Nobody. 
Politicians, dealers, lobbyists...

1083
01:44:50,157 --> 01:44:53,421
Firms, passing from one hand to another.

1084
01:44:53,637 --> 01:44:56,116
No specific person.

1085
01:44:56,117 --> 01:44:58,858
There are mediators like Tomski.

1086
01:44:58,877 --> 01:45:03,905
Apprentices like Fondari.
Clowns like Dupere.

1087
01:45:03,917 --> 01:45:05,116
Assistants...

1088
01:45:05,117 --> 01:45:07,858
- ... like Dubaye?
- Serrano.

1089
01:45:09,277 --> 01:45:12,018
I'm not interested either in Dubaye
or Serrano.

1090
01:45:12,117 --> 01:45:14,436
I'm only interested in the diary.

1091
01:45:14,437 --> 01:45:19,180
Not to burry it, on the contrary,
to put up for show!

1092
01:45:19,917 --> 01:45:22,836
I will report about everything
straight to the Minister of Justice.

1093
01:45:22,837 --> 01:45:26,818
- Straight to the Minister?
- Yes, Monsieur Marechal.

1094
01:45:26,997 --> 01:45:31,502
I've always acted according to my conscience
and worked with honest people.

1095
01:45:32,077 --> 01:45:34,818
Well, and if you're right,

1096
01:45:34,997 --> 01:45:39,297
I'll collect my pension earlier
and go fishing.

1097
01:45:39,397 --> 01:45:43,105
Frankly, I can't wait.

1098
01:45:44,437 --> 01:45:48,384
Give him the diary!
Those people will kill you.

1099
01:45:48,717 --> 01:45:50,836
We'll see.

1100
01:45:50,837 --> 01:45:55,137
She speaks like everyone else: 
'those people'. And who are they?

1101
01:45:55,917 --> 01:46:00,501
I will not rest until I find the name
of the person who killed Phillippe.

1102
01:46:01,237 --> 01:46:04,820
I'm not taking vengeance, Valerie.
I'm just being faithful.

1103
01:46:08,757 --> 01:46:11,384
Look out!

1104
01:48:39,197 --> 01:48:41,699
Who killed Philippe?

1105
01:48:51,117 --> 01:48:53,876
- Who killed Philippe?
- Leave it.

1106
01:48:53,877 --> 01:48:57,316
- I might die!
- Sure, but first you'll suffer.

1107
01:48:57,317 --> 01:48:59,375
I promise.

1108
01:48:59,597 --> 01:49:04,579
Think what you're doing to me.
I have a bullet in my knee, I'm bleeding.

1109
01:49:05,637 --> 01:49:07,556
No!

1110
01:49:07,557 --> 01:49:11,076
Let him answer for his deeds.
You can kill him!

1111
01:49:11,077 --> 01:49:16,298
I'll tell you everything.
It was done by... it was done by...

1112
01:49:31,397 --> 01:49:36,505
It's impossible! The Commissioner can't
disappear, leaving 4 corpses!

1113
01:49:36,837 --> 01:49:39,316
- If he had been kidnapped, they would call here.
- Urgent call!

1114
01:49:39,317 --> 01:49:43,059
- Yes, Report on the job.
- Hurry! From the city...

1115
01:49:44,357 --> 01:49:47,098
Hello! Hello! Yes!
Who's speaking?

1116
01:49:49,317 --> 01:49:54,299
Oh, I see?
That's interesting.

1117
01:49:55,397 --> 01:49:58,536
And where I can find you?

1118
01:49:59,637 --> 01:50:02,378
Yes, yes, alone.

1119
01:50:17,357 --> 01:50:21,065
- Where to?
- Defense subway station.

1120
01:50:23,157 --> 01:50:27,616
- Why did you make up your mind?
- I'm afraid.

1121
01:50:29,037 --> 01:50:31,937
Fear is a good adviser.

1122
01:50:39,597 --> 01:50:46,662
- So, can I consider it as a present?
- I don't make presents. Diary for name.

1123
01:50:48,957 --> 01:50:53,177
- Whose?
- Philippe's murderer.

1124
01:50:53,837 --> 01:50:56,578
I don't know the name.

1125
01:50:59,037 --> 01:51:01,778
Well, commissioner!

1126
01:51:01,877 --> 01:51:06,596
People forget their wives,
mothers, phone numbers,

1127
01:51:06,597 --> 01:51:10,100
but it's impossible for a man
to forget his own name.

1128
01:51:12,157 --> 01:51:16,536
Adrien Moreau.
The commissioner of the criminal police.

1129
01:51:17,037 --> 01:51:24,181
- Commissioner - by day, a criminal - at night.
- I have never heard such nonsense.

1130
01:51:26,237 --> 01:51:28,978
No, it's not nonsense.

1131
01:51:30,837 --> 01:51:34,306
I understood everything after 
the attack on Perne.

1132
01:51:35,557 --> 01:51:39,796
Since Fondari was shooting at the commissioner,
then he was sure, he'll be covered.

1133
01:51:39,797 --> 01:51:43,903
And only a cop could cover him.

1134
01:51:43,997 --> 01:51:48,900
There are 2 cops in this case: 
you and Perne.

1135
01:51:52,317 --> 01:51:57,823
That attack excludes Perne.
So, everything's clear.

1136
01:51:58,277 --> 01:52:04,500
Fondari was always a fool.
Perne and Fondari are two poles of stupidity.

1137
01:52:04,957 --> 01:52:10,303
Donkey and Pithecanthropus.
Fondari's law violated for twenty years.

1138
01:52:10,557 --> 01:52:15,556
But Perne is more dangerous, since in his
case stupidity acts in the name of the state.

1139
01:52:15,557 --> 01:52:20,221
- And Fondari works for himself.
- You too, I presume.

1140
01:52:20,437 --> 01:52:22,276
You think so?

1141
01:52:22,277 --> 01:52:26,796
I work for the common good.
I have information about entire Paris.

1142
01:52:26,797 --> 01:52:32,223
- I say hello to dregs, I go to see them.
- And kill them.

1143
01:52:32,917 --> 01:52:38,696
I can't stand scoundrels, Marechal.
Because of them this country dies.

1144
01:52:40,237 --> 01:52:44,059
Dregs in France make statements 
from the stands.

1145
01:52:44,117 --> 01:52:47,666
they control newspapers,
fund elections.

1146
01:52:47,877 --> 01:52:52,700
Their proteges extract them with
new markets, new areas of influence.

1147
01:52:52,917 --> 01:52:55,236
This is today's elite.

1148
01:52:55,237 --> 01:52:57,836
Tomorrow their sons will become aristocrats!

1149
01:52:57,837 --> 01:52:59,156
Era of scoundrels.

1150
01:52:59,157 --> 01:53:06,176
With the grace of God, but with the help of
that diary, I'll nip that filth in the bud.

1151
01:53:07,277 --> 01:53:09,236
We share a common goal.

1152
01:53:09,237 --> 01:53:13,956
When I kill Dubaye,
and you blow Dupere,

1153
01:53:13,957 --> 01:53:17,745
we both bleach our society!

1154
01:53:17,957 --> 01:53:21,596
- And Christiane Dubaye?
- She drank too much.

1155
01:53:21,597 --> 01:53:25,817
And talked too much.
She wanted to tell you the whole thing.

1156
01:53:26,037 --> 01:53:27,436
But we are soul mates!

1157
01:53:27,437 --> 01:53:31,737
We want to liberate the country
from a malignant tumor.

1158
01:53:38,317 --> 01:53:41,956
Do you understand that this is a historic
moment?

1159
01:53:41,957 --> 01:53:44,716
We have become significant people, 
Monsieur Marechal.

1160
01:53:44,717 --> 01:53:49,062
Robespierre and Saint Just
felt the same excitement.

1161
01:53:49,157 --> 01:53:52,626
- Psychiatrists will find it out in court.
- What court?

1162
01:53:53,477 --> 01:53:59,586
Yours. They would surely say that
you are obsessed, paranoid.

1163
01:54:00,557 --> 01:54:03,699
But they won't say the word describing 
who you really are,

1164
01:54:03,700 --> 01:54:06,700
because that word is not accepted 
in the jurisprudence.

1165
01:54:07,157 --> 01:54:12,378
The word is 'fool', Moreau!
But don't get upset!

1166
01:54:12,397 --> 01:54:13,956
You're not the first.

1167
01:54:13,957 --> 01:54:18,575
History has already known Savonarola,
Fouquier de Tinville.

1168
01:54:20,597 --> 01:54:24,021
Over-ordering is not less 
dangerous than chaos.

1169
01:54:24,197 --> 01:54:29,384
I hate corruption 
as much as your morals.

1170
01:54:33,037 --> 01:54:35,036
Just listen to yourself!

1171
01:54:35,037 --> 01:54:40,736
I can't stand scoundrels, Marechal.
Because of them this country dies.

1172
01:54:41,477 --> 01:54:44,980
Dregs in France make statements 
from the stands.

1173
01:54:47,077 --> 01:54:49,476
And everybody for Philippe Dubaye.

1174
01:54:49,477 --> 01:54:55,097
You are saving a whole gang
of villains to avenge a fop.

1175
01:54:55,397 --> 01:54:59,219
Surrender Moreau!
The station is surrounded!

1176
01:55:06,957 --> 01:55:08,936
Moreau!

1177
01:55:18,797 --> 01:55:25,702
- Thank you, thank you and bravo!
- I didn't want that to happen.

1178
01:55:32,397 --> 01:55:36,742
Senior Commissioner Moreau 
was a fierce humanist,

1179
01:55:36,757 --> 01:55:39,196
but also a wonderful cop.

1180
01:55:39,197 --> 01:55:42,939
"Competent",-as Fondari said,
another humanist.

1181
01:55:44,757 --> 01:55:46,676
What will happen to it?

1182
01:55:46,677 --> 01:55:51,898
One copy goes to the investigator,
the second one, to the Minister of Justice.

1183
01:55:52,597 --> 01:55:56,385
I presume Philippe Dubaye 
isn't mentioned there.

1184
01:55:57,317 --> 01:56:00,866
Of course not.
Why should he?

1185
01:56:02,957 --> 01:56:06,745
Take this!
And goodbye, commissioner.

1186
01:56:09,357 --> 01:56:14,146
- And what will be the end of all this?
- Nothing.

1187
01:56:15,117 --> 01:56:18,556
If commissioner Perne is an honest man,

1188
01:56:18,557 --> 01:56:22,106
he'll retire and go fishing.

1189
01:56:24,037 --> 01:56:28,576
If he's not,
he'll become the Prefect of Police.

1190
01:56:29,477 --> 01:56:32,876
Some of the people's representatives 
will stay on their toes, but not for long.

1191
01:56:32,877 --> 01:56:36,636
I assure you, time will pass
and they will have

1192
01:56:36,637 --> 01:56:39,916
new masks of honest Republicans.

1193
01:56:39,917 --> 01:56:43,022
Like old women,
who tighten the skin on their faces.

1194
01:56:43,037 --> 01:56:43,996
No!

1195
01:56:43,997 --> 01:56:48,740
No, it's only the fish that should 
tremble for it's life.

1196
01:56:51,357 --> 01:56:55,436
Sleep soundly, Parisians.
All is well.

1197
01:56:55,437 --> 01:56:59,222
