1
00:00:51,308 --> 00:00:56,844
If you're watching this, you've
discovered something you shouldn't have.

2
00:01:04,053 --> 00:01:05,887
Anyway, um...

3
00:01:07,757 --> 00:01:12,994
This... This is a close-up
of a model's eye.

4
00:01:13,128 --> 00:01:15,830
Yeah. I can't remember her
name to save my life,

5
00:01:15,832 --> 00:01:19,100
but she had the bluest eyes
I've ever seen.

6
00:01:19,102 --> 00:01:23,938
The only other time I remember seeing
this exact intensity of blue...

7
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,874
was the day my sister drowned.

8
00:01:26,876 --> 00:01:28,076
It was everywhere.

9
00:01:28,078 --> 00:01:32,747
It was in the water,
in the sky, Nicole's skin.

10
00:01:32,749 --> 00:01:35,283
Blue.
I remember.

11
00:01:35,551 --> 00:01:36,551
And gold.

12
00:01:36,553 --> 00:01:39,821
The gold of the light
off the surface of the water.

13
00:01:39,823 --> 00:01:44,158
Like an empty frame
flashing onto the screen.

14
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:47,295
Nicole.

15
00:01:47,297 --> 00:01:50,031
She's the one girl
I keep trying to remember.

16
00:01:50,033 --> 00:01:53,234
But I... I think
she's the problem.

17
00:01:53,236 --> 00:01:59,007
I think she's the reason
I am the way I am, right?

18
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:44,679
Maybe I should back up and try to
explain what the hell happened here.

19
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,450
<i>Jesus Christ. What the
hell did happen here?</i>

20
00:03:49,452 --> 00:03:50,918
<i>Um...</i>

21
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,688
Well, let's start with me.

22
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,723
My name is Kevin Wolfe.

23
00:03:55,725 --> 00:03:56,891
I'm a studio photographer.

24
00:03:56,893 --> 00:04:02,029
I do head shots, and most
of my clients are girls.

25
00:04:02,031 --> 00:04:03,764
Girls.

26
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:06,734
They've sort of been the focus
of my whole fucking life.

27
00:04:06,736 --> 00:04:08,002
They're sort of
a problem for me.

28
00:04:08,004 --> 00:04:11,739
I've just been trying to find a way
to forget all the bad experiences...

29
00:04:11,741 --> 00:04:14,475
and try to have
at least one good one, so...

30
00:04:14,477 --> 00:04:16,844
every girl that comes
into this studio...

31
00:04:16,846 --> 00:04:20,848
every actress, every model...

32
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:22,283
I ask out.

33
00:04:22,285 --> 00:04:24,719
Would you like to see a movie?

34
00:04:24,721 --> 00:04:26,921
And they almost always say...

35
00:04:26,923 --> 00:04:28,689
No.

36
00:04:28,691 --> 00:04:31,125
And so, I do
this forgetting thing.

37
00:04:31,127 --> 00:04:32,059
It's like a ritual.

38
00:04:32,061 --> 00:04:35,663
I mean, I know it sounds weird, but
you gotta do something positive...

39
00:04:35,665 --> 00:04:39,967
to cancel out the negative
experiences, right?

40
00:04:39,969 --> 00:04:41,969
Um, for instance,

41
00:04:41,971 --> 00:04:45,840
I forgot Theresa
by going to Coney Island.

42
00:04:45,842 --> 00:04:48,476
And before Theresa
there was Carrie,

43
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:50,645
who decided to stand me up
at the movies.

44
00:04:50,647 --> 00:04:55,917
<i>Forgot her by watching every
single episode of Lost on DVD.</i>

45
00:04:56,952 --> 00:05:00,121
And then, uh...

46
00:05:00,556 --> 00:05:01,989
Then there was Sheila.

47
00:05:01,991 --> 00:05:03,724
She was a real girl, you know?

48
00:05:03,726 --> 00:05:05,793
Not like most actresses...
not fake.

49
00:05:05,795 --> 00:05:10,264
Although she does look
really overdone here.

50
00:05:10,266 --> 00:05:11,332
My assistant Jamie,

51
00:05:11,334 --> 00:05:13,801
she sometimes went
a little crazy with the makeup.

52
00:05:13,803 --> 00:05:17,338
Anyway, I remember asking...
Are you single?

53
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:21,042
Um, I'm only 19.

54
00:05:21,044 --> 00:05:22,577
Oh.

55
00:05:22,579 --> 00:05:27,281
Um, do you have
a... a boyfriend?

56
00:05:27,283 --> 00:05:30,084
Oh, no. No, I don't.

57
00:05:30,086 --> 00:05:33,921
Maybe we could go
to a-a movie sometime?

58
00:05:34,289 --> 00:05:37,158
Uh...

59
00:05:37,926 --> 00:05:39,126
Sure.

60
00:05:39,128 --> 00:05:41,996
Yeah. Uh, sure.
Um...

61
00:05:41,998 --> 00:05:44,165
I... I like movies.

62
00:05:44,167 --> 00:05:47,235
A lot of girls have
a hard time saying no,

63
00:05:47,237 --> 00:05:50,204
especially if they're from Iowa
or some fucking place.

64
00:05:50,206 --> 00:05:52,106
It's like they're trying
to be polite all the time.

65
00:05:52,108 --> 00:05:55,176
But, anyway, she called the day
we were supposed to go out...

66
00:05:55,178 --> 00:05:56,510
and she said she'd forgotten
about other plans.

67
00:05:56,512 --> 00:06:01,582
Some relative was in from out of town, I
think, or something, blah, blah, blah.

68
00:06:01,584 --> 00:06:04,252
I forgot her
by going to the newsstand.

69
00:06:04,254 --> 00:06:06,721
Flipping through
the fashion magazines,

70
00:06:06,723 --> 00:06:09,657
the pictures of
the skinny supermodels,

71
00:06:09,659 --> 00:06:13,861
the emaciated and beautiful.

72
00:06:14,963 --> 00:06:21,602
And then, uh, there are the ones
who are not so easy to forget...

73
00:06:21,604 --> 00:06:24,505
because they are the ones
who said...

74
00:06:24,507 --> 00:06:26,307
Yes.

75
00:06:26,309 --> 00:06:28,109
Okay.

76
00:06:36,485 --> 00:06:38,152
This looks great.
Thanks.

77
00:06:38,154 --> 00:06:41,055
It's a great smile.

78
00:06:42,324 --> 00:06:44,425
Have you done a lot of acting?

79
00:06:44,427 --> 00:06:46,594
I mean, theater or...

80
00:06:46,596 --> 00:06:50,231
Um, a few years ago,
I went on some auditions.

81
00:06:50,233 --> 00:06:52,633
And then I met this guy,

82
00:06:52,635 --> 00:06:54,802
and... now I'm a hostess.

83
00:06:54,804 --> 00:06:59,373
But I'm planning on
getting back into it.

84
00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:03,344
How old are you?

85
00:07:03,346 --> 00:07:04,912
How old am I?

86
00:07:04,914 --> 00:07:08,649
Why do you want to know
how old I am?

87
00:07:09,818 --> 00:07:11,819
Where'd you grow up?

88
00:07:11,821 --> 00:07:13,621
Who said I ever grew up?

89
00:07:13,623 --> 00:07:15,656
Oh.

90
00:07:15,658 --> 00:07:17,191
Well, where'd you go to school?

91
00:07:17,193 --> 00:07:21,629
You know, usually, how this works is that
I'm usually the one asking questions.

92
00:07:21,631 --> 00:07:23,064
Oh.

93
00:07:23,066 --> 00:07:26,434
What are you doing tonight?

94
00:07:27,202 --> 00:07:29,103
What am I doing?

95
00:07:29,105 --> 00:07:32,273
Do you want to go out
with me, Kevin?

96
00:07:32,641 --> 00:07:34,775
Oh, like what?
Like a movie?

97
00:07:34,777 --> 00:07:38,946
I was thinking more like a bar.

98
00:07:40,015 --> 00:07:42,383
Okay.

99
00:07:52,361 --> 00:07:54,362
Kevin.

100
00:07:59,668 --> 00:08:02,503
I had a bad dream.

101
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,930
Oh, my God.

102
00:09:04,332 --> 00:09:09,270
- Good morning.
- Are you taking pictures of me?

103
00:09:09,272 --> 00:09:11,172
Taking one picture.
Here.

104
00:09:11,174 --> 00:09:13,374
See? You look beautiful.

105
00:09:13,376 --> 00:09:15,443
Not likely.
Yeah, you do.

106
00:09:15,445 --> 00:09:18,746
Oh, God.

107
00:09:20,282 --> 00:09:22,583
What time is it?

108
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:29,990
Oh, my God.

109
00:09:29,992 --> 00:09:32,860
I don't want you to get
the wrong idea about me.

110
00:09:32,862 --> 00:09:35,262
Get the wrong idea?

111
00:09:35,264 --> 00:09:38,098
What wrong idea?

112
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,867
Um...

113
00:09:41,603 --> 00:09:45,306
Yeah. I mean, I can't
believe that I, like...

114
00:09:45,308 --> 00:09:47,308
Listen, I'm not, uh...

115
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:51,212
I'm not the type of person
that just wants to...

116
00:09:51,214 --> 00:09:53,814
Uh, fuck.

117
00:09:53,816 --> 00:09:58,886
Listen, I know that... I know that I
really don't know you at all, Adrienne.

118
00:09:58,888 --> 00:10:01,989
I can't even think of your
last name at the moment.

119
00:10:01,991 --> 00:10:05,192
But... And it's safe to say
that you don't know me,

120
00:10:05,194 --> 00:10:06,861
but...

121
00:10:06,863 --> 00:10:10,130
I really feel
that we made this...

122
00:10:10,132 --> 00:10:12,099
this connection.

123
00:10:12,101 --> 00:10:13,901
Right?

124
00:10:14,669 --> 00:10:16,670
Uh, a connection?
Yeah.

125
00:10:16,672 --> 00:10:19,773
I mean, you're here, I'm here,

126
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:24,645
and I just feel like there's this...
there's a spark.

127
00:10:24,647 --> 00:10:28,649
I mean, what I want,
really, is just...

128
00:10:29,651 --> 00:10:30,851
I just want a girl, you know?

129
00:10:30,853 --> 00:10:35,089
I mean, I'm just a guy. I mean, I'm
not, like, a fashion photographer.

130
00:10:35,091 --> 00:10:37,992
It's nothing glamorous.
I just do head shots, you know...

131
00:10:37,994 --> 00:10:41,295
300 a digital set,
prints are extra.

132
00:10:41,297 --> 00:10:44,532
It's the deal I gave
you, essentially. Yeah.

133
00:10:44,534 --> 00:10:46,433
Um, hey, listen.

134
00:10:46,435 --> 00:10:52,706
Yesterday was, like,
a really, um, weird day for me.

135
00:10:53,808 --> 00:10:55,609
So...

136
00:10:55,611 --> 00:10:58,112
Mmm.
Yeah.

137
00:10:58,114 --> 00:10:59,914
Okay.

138
00:11:00,115 --> 00:11:02,082
Sh... Coffee?
Do you want coffee?

139
00:11:02,084 --> 00:11:04,885
I could go down to the corner...
No, thanks.

140
00:11:04,887 --> 00:11:06,787
No, thanks.

141
00:11:07,455 --> 00:11:09,490
You have to go to work?

142
00:11:09,492 --> 00:11:11,825
Work. Yeah, I do.
Work.

143
00:11:11,827 --> 00:11:15,596
Can I, um... Can I
call you sometime?

144
00:11:15,598 --> 00:11:19,867
Um, did I give you my number?

145
00:11:22,737 --> 00:11:24,605
Oh. Wow.

146
00:11:24,607 --> 00:11:26,774
Uh, yeah, you gave it
to Jamie on the card...

147
00:11:26,776 --> 00:11:32,313
so that I could call you when the
pictures were ready. Oh! Right, right.

148
00:11:36,151 --> 00:11:39,520
Awkward.
Okay.

149
00:11:39,522 --> 00:11:41,355
Thanks!

150
00:11:43,892 --> 00:11:46,060
Fuck. Fucking fuck.

151
00:11:46,062 --> 00:11:48,729
I am such a fucking idiot.
Oh, my God.

152
00:11:48,731 --> 00:11:51,932
Oh, my God. I can't
believe how stupid I am.

153
00:11:53,235 --> 00:11:57,237
No idea how to talk to people...
girls in particular.

154
00:11:58,274 --> 00:12:01,609
Hi. I really think we had
this connection, right?

155
00:12:01,611 --> 00:12:05,879
Hi! We have a connection.
I really think, uh...

156
00:12:22,597 --> 00:12:24,632
Stupid. I'm so fucking stupid.
I'm stupid.

157
00:12:24,634 --> 00:12:29,403
I'm such a fucking moron. I'm such
a fucking dumb-ass piece of shit.

158
00:12:29,405 --> 00:12:32,006
Fucking brain...

159
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,676
Hey.

160
00:12:35,678 --> 00:12:37,444
Hi.

161
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:40,714
Do you wanna go camping?

162
00:12:40,716 --> 00:12:42,483
Uh, Derek and me were...

163
00:12:42,485 --> 00:12:46,620
Derek and I are going camping,
and we want you to go.

164
00:12:46,622 --> 00:12:52,092
And I was thinking you could do
some of your nature photography.

165
00:12:53,395 --> 00:12:57,831
You know, if you don't want
to, that is totally fine.

166
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,933
Please tell me
you're kidding, right?

167
00:12:59,935 --> 00:13:03,170
Yeah. I was kidding.
You're kidding.

168
00:13:03,172 --> 00:13:05,839
Yeah. I got you.
You got me.

169
00:13:05,841 --> 00:13:09,977
I'm going to go set up now.
Okay.

170
00:14:09,003 --> 00:14:12,339
Do you have any pictures
to show me?

171
00:14:12,341 --> 00:14:14,108
Nah.

172
00:14:14,442 --> 00:14:16,543
You never show me your pictures.

173
00:14:16,545 --> 00:14:19,012
They're just girls.

174
00:14:19,014 --> 00:14:21,014
They're just...
head shots.

175
00:14:21,016 --> 00:14:25,152
They're boring, Ruby.
They'd bore you.

176
00:14:25,553 --> 00:14:28,355
Girls are nice.

177
00:14:28,623 --> 00:14:30,858
You wouldn't like 'em.
Trust me, Ruby.

178
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:33,127
You wouldn't like any of 'em.

179
00:14:33,129 --> 00:14:35,929
They're not dirty pictures,
are they?

180
00:14:36,197 --> 00:14:37,197
Come on.

181
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:41,368
I've seen those magazines. I know what all
kinds of pictures they have out there.

182
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:43,804
They're not dirty.
You're taking dirty pictures!

183
00:14:43,806 --> 00:14:49,176
You are crazy, Ruby.
You are a crazy old woman.

184
00:14:49,377 --> 00:14:53,847
You shouldn't call me Ruby.
You should call me Grandma.

185
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:59,353
Ruby, can I see
the pictures of Nicole?

186
00:15:11,599 --> 00:15:14,201
She wasn't supposed to be
called "Nicole," you know,

187
00:15:14,203 --> 00:15:17,471
because that was
your mother's name.

188
00:15:17,473 --> 00:15:19,106
I know.

189
00:15:19,108 --> 00:15:23,043
But when she died,
we thought it was fitting.

190
00:15:23,211 --> 00:15:27,247
Just a newborn baby,
and a little girl and all.

191
00:15:27,249 --> 00:15:29,783
Such a pretty little baby.

192
00:15:29,785 --> 00:15:33,921
It was fitting she should
have your mother's name.

193
00:15:33,923 --> 00:15:35,055
Oh, your mother...

194
00:15:35,057 --> 00:15:39,560
I guess it was just
one of those things.

195
00:15:39,562 --> 00:15:43,530
They said they
couldn't have known.

196
00:15:44,098 --> 00:15:49,102
And I thought I could console
myself with little Nicole.

197
00:15:51,706 --> 00:15:54,675
You're all I've got left.

198
00:17:03,011 --> 00:17:05,145
Fuck.

199
00:17:05,713 --> 00:17:09,182
It's not that you're
a bad guy or anything.

200
00:17:09,184 --> 00:17:12,853
I mean, you seem like
you're really nice.

201
00:17:12,855 --> 00:17:14,955
It's just...
I don't know...

202
00:17:14,957 --> 00:17:18,258
like you seem
kind of like, um...

203
00:17:19,527 --> 00:17:23,130
You know, like, with
the whole connection thing?

204
00:17:24,165 --> 00:17:28,068
And then, plus, the mood
that I was in when we...

205
00:17:28,436 --> 00:17:34,741
You know, um, I was kind of
acting something out.

206
00:17:34,743 --> 00:17:37,344
I mean, you... you asked
me out, you know.

207
00:17:37,346 --> 00:17:40,047
Why would you ask me out?
I mean, I don't...

208
00:17:40,049 --> 00:17:41,348
I'm sorry.

209
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:45,285
It's not something that you
should do lightly, you know.

210
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:51,758
You know what?
Thank you for the head shots.

211
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,062
I, uh... Yeah, I have some, uh, extra
prints in here, if you want them.

212
00:17:55,064 --> 00:17:59,433
And I ended up using one of
them, actually, for my flyer.

213
00:17:59,435 --> 00:18:01,068
I hope that doesn't bother you.

214
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:04,571
Oh, no, it's fine.
And these are fine.

215
00:18:04,573 --> 00:18:05,839
Yeah.
Um...

216
00:18:05,841 --> 00:18:09,109
It is fine. It's gonna be fine.
It's totally fine.

217
00:18:09,111 --> 00:18:12,045
It's, uh... Don't even
feel bad about it.

218
00:18:12,047 --> 00:18:14,381
You know, I know a lot of girls.

219
00:18:14,383 --> 00:18:16,650
Um, it's just...

220
00:18:16,918 --> 00:18:19,686
I felt... I felt like
we had a, uh...

221
00:18:19,688 --> 00:18:21,588
Hey, Kevin.

222
00:18:23,424 --> 00:18:25,993
I'm sorry.

223
00:18:28,262 --> 00:18:29,262
Me too.

224
00:18:29,264 --> 00:18:33,166
You know when you're in a museum
and you're looking at a painting,

225
00:18:33,168 --> 00:18:35,702
and it's really
freaking you out?

226
00:18:35,704 --> 00:18:39,306
It's all jagged and awful,
and it gets inside you?

227
00:18:39,308 --> 00:18:43,910
Then you just turn your head
and walk through the door...

228
00:18:43,912 --> 00:18:46,980
into another room of the museum,

229
00:18:46,982 --> 00:18:48,849
and you're looking
at another painting...

230
00:18:48,851 --> 00:18:55,288
a calculation of colors, abstract
and meaningless, but beautiful.

231
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:57,491
So beautiful.

232
00:18:57,493 --> 00:18:59,960
Just waiting for you...

233
00:18:59,962 --> 00:19:03,196
if you just walk through.

234
00:19:12,173 --> 00:19:13,173
Hi.

235
00:19:13,175 --> 00:19:15,642
Uh, my name's Kevin Wolfe.
I'm a studio photographer.

236
00:19:15,644 --> 00:19:19,446
I do head shots, $300 a digital set.
Prints are extra.

237
00:19:19,448 --> 00:19:22,282
You've probably
seen my flyers...

238
00:19:22,284 --> 00:19:23,784
all over the city?

239
00:19:23,786 --> 00:19:26,920
No? Sounds like you've said
that a few times before.

240
00:19:26,922 --> 00:19:31,091
Yeah, I think I even
say it in my sleep.

241
00:19:31,093 --> 00:19:33,226
Well, I mean, it's okay
if you haven't seen 'em.

242
00:19:33,228 --> 00:19:37,030
It's probably not something
you'd pay attention to anyway.

243
00:19:37,131 --> 00:19:40,667
I mean, unless, of course, you know,
you wanted to get head shots, right?

244
00:19:40,669 --> 00:19:42,702
I mean, are you, uh, an actor?

245
00:19:42,704 --> 00:19:46,073
Yeah, uh, actually, I need some.

246
00:19:46,075 --> 00:19:47,874
Yeah?

247
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:50,644
I'm Beth.

248
00:19:50,646 --> 00:19:53,046
Beth, uh...
Beth Dalewell.

249
00:19:53,048 --> 00:19:55,248
Beth Dalewell.

250
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:58,151
Are you, uh, enjoying
the play so far?

251
00:19:58,153 --> 00:20:02,122
Yeah. Uh, so far
it's all right.

252
00:20:02,124 --> 00:20:04,691
Just all right?
Yeah.

253
00:20:04,693 --> 00:20:07,327
I don't know. It's kind of
embarrassing, isn't it?

254
00:20:07,329 --> 00:20:11,565
I mean, the guy's walking around in
white tights pretending to be a swan.

255
00:20:11,567 --> 00:20:14,334
I don't know. We're actually
supposed to believe he is one.

256
00:20:14,336 --> 00:20:14,836
Yeah.

257
00:20:20,308 --> 00:20:24,010
Did... Did you produce it
or something?

258
00:20:24,012 --> 00:20:25,912
Oh, no. No, no, no.
I mean...

259
00:20:25,914 --> 00:20:29,116
I did the head shots
for someone in that cast.

260
00:20:29,118 --> 00:20:32,619
Yep. And plus, I'm just
a fan of the theater.

261
00:20:34,455 --> 00:20:36,957
Oh, fuck. I can't believe
I just said that.

262
00:20:36,959 --> 00:20:40,961
"I'm a fan of the theater."

263
00:20:40,963 --> 00:20:42,696
"The theater."

264
00:20:42,698 --> 00:20:44,865
I'm sorry.
I'm just an idiot.

265
00:20:44,867 --> 00:20:47,834
No, you're...
you're funny.

266
00:20:47,836 --> 00:20:49,836
I'm funny? What do you...
What do you mean?

267
00:20:49,838 --> 00:20:53,473
I don't know. You're just...
You're just funny.

268
00:20:55,611 --> 00:20:57,377
So...

269
00:21:16,797 --> 00:21:21,168
Are you, um,
coming from Kevin's?

270
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:24,871
Uh, yeah. Just picking
up some head shots.

271
00:21:24,873 --> 00:21:26,706
Photos.

272
00:21:29,143 --> 00:21:31,011
Are you an actress?

273
00:21:31,013 --> 00:21:33,980
I'd like to be.

274
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:40,921
What do you do?

275
00:21:41,689 --> 00:21:43,557
Nothing.

276
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:45,959
Really?

277
00:21:45,961 --> 00:21:50,897
I'm sort of the...
the landlord.

278
00:21:50,899 --> 00:21:52,866
Oh.

279
00:21:55,836 --> 00:21:58,872
I feel like I'm just like this
worthless piece of shit...

280
00:21:58,874 --> 00:22:02,042
that, like, exists in the world
for absolutely no reason.

281
00:22:02,044 --> 00:22:06,079
And, like, I should just essentially be
dead, and everyone would be happier.

282
00:22:06,081 --> 00:22:07,948
Like everyone else
has a reason to be alive,

283
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:12,852
and I'm just, like, this worthless
failure that has no... point.

284
00:22:12,854 --> 00:22:14,354
Okay, Jamie.
James. Listen.

285
00:22:14,356 --> 00:22:15,622
I look in the mirror,
and I'm just like...

286
00:22:15,624 --> 00:22:19,526
I just feel like I'm so ugly
and hideous, and I...

287
00:22:19,528 --> 00:22:23,463
Jamie, listen. You're not hideous, Jamie.
You're not ugly at all.

288
00:22:23,465 --> 00:22:26,132
Will you... Will you stop
being so negative?

289
00:22:26,134 --> 00:22:27,467
<i>Why don't you try
being positive?</i>

290
00:22:27,469 --> 00:22:30,036
<i>Think about... Think about anything.
I know, Derek.</i>

291
00:22:30,038 --> 00:22:34,107
I know it is your job
to talk me down, okay?

292
00:22:34,109 --> 00:22:36,443
And...

293
00:22:36,445 --> 00:22:40,046
I'm not gonna
drink anything, okay?

294
00:22:40,048 --> 00:22:42,716
And thank you, you know?
Thank you.

295
00:22:42,718 --> 00:22:44,818
You're like my only friend
in the entire world,

296
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:48,555
and that is why I call you,
because you're nice, you know?

297
00:22:48,557 --> 00:22:52,659
You're a very, very,
very nice sponsor.

298
00:22:52,661 --> 00:22:55,662
I'm really gla...
Can you hold on?

299
00:22:55,664 --> 00:22:58,198
I have another call.

300
00:23:00,668 --> 00:23:02,802
Hi, honey.

301
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:07,207
<i>Hi, Mom. I didn't
interrupt anything?</i>

302
00:23:07,209 --> 00:23:09,643
<i>No. I can call you
back if you want.</i>

303
00:23:09,645 --> 00:23:10,777
<i>No.
What are you doing?</i>

304
00:23:10,779 --> 00:23:14,714
I was just on the other line
with the suicide hotline, so...

305
00:23:14,716 --> 00:23:17,384
<i>Really? Yeah. They
said I should do it.</i>

306
00:23:17,386 --> 00:23:19,919
<i>Oh, my God, Jamie. Are you okay?
I'm kidding.</i>

307
00:23:19,921 --> 00:23:22,656
<i>I'm kidding, Mom. Why would
you scare me like that?</i>

308
00:23:22,658 --> 00:23:24,824
Can you please
hold on for a second?

309
00:23:24,826 --> 00:23:26,626
The swan started crying,
you know?

310
00:23:26,628 --> 00:23:30,830
The dancing was one thing,
and then... and then, yeah.

311
00:24:24,752 --> 00:24:25,752
Hi.
Hey.

312
00:24:25,754 --> 00:24:28,521
So, I still need you to get
me a key for the downstairs,

313
00:24:28,523 --> 00:24:31,391
and then you wouldn't have to buzz
me in every time I come to work.

314
00:24:31,393 --> 00:24:33,927
I don't mind it, but since I
already have the upstairs key,

315
00:24:33,929 --> 00:24:36,396
and I know it bothers you... I
keep forgetting about that.

316
00:24:36,398 --> 00:24:38,798
Would you mind making
some coffee, please? Yes.

317
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:42,001
So... you know how I was
telling you Derek is gay?

318
00:24:42,003 --> 00:24:46,673
I know you knew he was gay, but all
of my best friends are always gay.

319
00:24:46,675 --> 00:24:49,542
"Fag hag." That's what they
used to call me in high school.

320
00:24:49,544 --> 00:24:51,378
Because my best friend
was gay... Tony.

321
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,612
Oh, my God.
You would like Tony.

322
00:24:52,614 --> 00:24:55,682
The weird thing is is that I
have never known any lesbians.

323
00:24:55,684 --> 00:24:57,584
I mean, I don't think
I'd get along with one.

324
00:24:57,586 --> 00:24:59,152
Although, who's to judge?
I don't know.

325
00:24:59,154 --> 00:25:01,454
Maybe I've known a lot of
lesbians and didn't know. God.

326
00:25:01,456 --> 00:25:04,991
If I was friends with lesbians in high school,
they couldn't have called me "fag hag."

327
00:25:04,993 --> 00:25:09,996
They'd have to call me something
else like "lesbi-friend."

328
00:25:09,998 --> 00:25:11,631
Oh, shit.

329
00:25:11,633 --> 00:25:13,600
You didn't think, a minute ago,

330
00:25:13,602 --> 00:25:15,769
that I was saying
I thought you were gay,

331
00:25:15,771 --> 00:25:17,570
'cause that is not
what I was saying.

332
00:25:17,572 --> 00:25:21,274
I would not want you
to think... That's not...

333
00:25:21,276 --> 00:25:22,675
Wow.

334
00:25:22,677 --> 00:25:24,677
So, yeah, Derek
is not my boyfriend,

335
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:28,748
and I wouldn't even want Derek to be
my boyfriend even if he wasn't gay.

336
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:34,053
I mean... You know what I'm saying?
Kevin?

337
00:25:38,225 --> 00:25:40,360
Sorry.

338
00:25:41,695 --> 00:25:45,331
Jesus Christ, Tanner.
It's dark as hell in here.

339
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:45,865
Sorry.

340
00:25:45,867 --> 00:25:50,136
I need to borrow your... your car this weekend.
Is that all right?

341
00:25:51,806 --> 00:25:53,773
What have you got in your hand?

342
00:25:53,775 --> 00:25:57,310
Just pictures.
Photographs.

343
00:25:57,312 --> 00:25:59,145
Let's see.

344
00:25:59,147 --> 00:25:59,946
I don't think so.

345
00:25:59,948 --> 00:26:04,784
If you want to borrow the
Impala, show me the pictures.

346
00:26:13,928 --> 00:26:16,396
That's a good boy.

347
00:26:16,398 --> 00:26:19,799
Mmm.
Mmm.

348
00:26:20,801 --> 00:26:22,702
I saw this one on the poster.

349
00:26:22,704 --> 00:26:25,872
Wait a minute. You mean you
actually left your apartment?

350
00:26:25,874 --> 00:26:28,608
Hilarious.

351
00:26:31,445 --> 00:26:33,613
Did you fuck her?

352
00:26:36,116 --> 00:26:37,584
Let's look at yours.

353
00:26:37,586 --> 00:26:40,487
Mine are better.
Yeah, I'm sure.

354
00:26:42,624 --> 00:26:45,024
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

355
00:26:47,528 --> 00:26:50,630
Aw! God.

356
00:26:50,632 --> 00:26:53,333
Look at this one. What is...
What is that?

357
00:26:53,335 --> 00:26:55,602
That's a fish.

358
00:26:55,604 --> 00:26:57,136
Why would she...

359
00:26:57,138 --> 00:26:59,639
Look at this one.

360
00:27:00,307 --> 00:27:02,175
Yeah. Oh.

361
00:27:02,177 --> 00:27:04,010
Where do you get this shit?

362
00:27:04,012 --> 00:27:07,280
Come on, Kevin.
This is beautiful.

363
00:27:07,282 --> 00:27:09,616
You're so fucked up.

364
00:27:09,618 --> 00:27:11,417
Yeah.

365
00:27:12,553 --> 00:27:14,954
Can I keep this?

366
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:18,725
Yeah, it's yours.

367
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:21,094
Thanks.

368
00:27:21,096 --> 00:27:23,129
Don't you want this?

369
00:27:23,131 --> 00:27:25,365
No.
Why?

370
00:27:26,534 --> 00:27:28,568
What'd you do to her?

371
00:27:30,906 --> 00:27:33,239
I guess I scared her.

372
00:27:33,241 --> 00:27:35,241
Yeah, apparently.

373
00:27:35,243 --> 00:27:37,610
Apparently, I do that sometimes.

374
00:27:39,713 --> 00:27:43,583
Anyway, Adrienne's memory
played on in my psyche...

375
00:27:43,585 --> 00:27:47,687
like one of those
extended remixes...

376
00:27:47,689 --> 00:27:52,125
over and over and over.

377
00:27:52,127 --> 00:27:54,093
How did I forget her?

378
00:27:56,064 --> 00:27:58,197
<i>Hello?
Hey, it's Kevin.</i>

379
00:27:58,199 --> 00:28:02,702
<i>You, uh... You still
going camping?</i>

380
00:28:02,704 --> 00:28:03,303
Yes.

381
00:28:03,305 --> 00:28:06,039
So I'm pretty much not sure
what I'm going to call it yet.

382
00:28:06,041 --> 00:28:08,808
It could either be
a "uni-peg" or a "pega-corn,"

383
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:12,612
or I could just call it something really
simple like "flying horse with horn."

384
00:28:12,614 --> 00:28:14,781
You know what I mean? If I
just need to keep it simple.

385
00:28:14,783 --> 00:28:18,818
But basically, it's like the most
incredible animal that's ever existed.

386
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,687
It's half unicorn, half Pegasus.

387
00:28:20,689 --> 00:28:24,457
So it's like a flying horse
with wings and a horn.

388
00:28:24,459 --> 00:28:28,494
I can't even tell you how important the
Pegasus on its own, without a horn,

389
00:28:28,496 --> 00:28:30,296
has been essentially
since I was, like, born.

390
00:28:30,298 --> 00:28:32,565
'Cause when I was a kid, I had
this game called Dark Tower.

391
00:28:32,567 --> 00:28:35,101
It's, like, there's this tower,
and it's called the Dark Tower.

392
00:28:35,103 --> 00:28:38,371
And there's all these things like Brigands...
I think the Brigand is the bad guy.

393
00:28:38,373 --> 00:28:40,506
Then there's this other...
like you have rations.

394
00:28:40,508 --> 00:28:42,342
Oh, yeah. And you go
to the Bazaar.

395
00:28:42,344 --> 00:28:43,977
It spins around, and I don't know...
Jamie.

396
00:28:43,979 --> 00:28:49,515
Could you stop, like... Could you stop
talking, please? For like a second.

397
00:28:49,517 --> 00:28:51,584
- I'm sorry.-

398
00:28:51,586 --> 00:28:53,720
I'm really sorry.
No, don't be sorry.

399
00:28:53,722 --> 00:28:56,556
You just... You make me
nervous, I guess.

400
00:28:56,558 --> 00:28:58,725
There's nothing
to be nervous about.

401
00:28:58,727 --> 00:29:01,861
There isn't?
No. I like you, okay?

402
00:29:01,863 --> 00:29:05,498
Just... with the talking,
please just be calm, okay?

403
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,834
For an exercise. Because
I want to be quiet.

404
00:29:07,836 --> 00:29:12,038
I mean, I really do. It's like
I want my mouth to just die.

405
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,906
But then, like, all of
a sudden, it's back.

406
00:29:13,908 --> 00:29:16,909
It resurrects like Christ,
and then it's like... Jamie!

407
00:29:16,911 --> 00:29:18,277
Please!
I am begging you.

408
00:29:18,279 --> 00:29:20,380
Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Thank you.

409
00:29:20,382 --> 00:29:22,148
I'll shut up.

410
00:29:29,056 --> 00:29:32,825
She told me how she feels
about you, Kevin.

411
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,830
You might take that
into consideration.

412
00:29:39,767 --> 00:29:42,135
What are you talking about?

413
00:29:42,403 --> 00:29:46,673
Jamie's... very fragile.

414
00:29:48,442 --> 00:29:52,078
I'm not saying
she'd do anything, but...

415
00:29:53,681 --> 00:29:57,383
Just do me a favor
and be nice to her.

416
00:29:57,385 --> 00:29:58,785
Yeah.

417
00:29:58,787 --> 00:30:01,454
Yeah, of course.

418
00:30:24,612 --> 00:30:28,214
Everybody loves him.
He's very talented.

419
00:30:38,292 --> 00:30:42,628
Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet.

420
00:30:44,832 --> 00:30:47,900
Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet!

421
00:30:47,902 --> 00:30:51,938
I'm sorry.
Tweet, tweet.

422
00:30:54,174 --> 00:30:56,109
Tweet, tweet!

423
00:30:57,478 --> 00:31:01,547
In the end, I did end up
forgetting Theresa...

424
00:31:01,549 --> 00:31:06,285
and Doris and Allison
and Sheila and Adrienne...

425
00:31:06,287 --> 00:31:07,620
and... and all of them.

426
00:31:07,622 --> 00:31:09,889
I mean, it's not that
I forgot them literally though.

427
00:31:09,891 --> 00:31:15,394
It's just I made it
so I didn't care anymore.

428
00:31:15,629 --> 00:31:19,065
See? That's a picture
of me not caring.

429
00:31:20,935 --> 00:31:22,735
Ah, anyway, um,

430
00:31:22,737 --> 00:31:27,740
I decided I had to try to remember
more about my sister Nicole,

431
00:31:27,742 --> 00:31:28,908
what happened.

432
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:31,644
Try to really find
the answer this time,

433
00:31:31,646 --> 00:31:37,850
try to figure out...
why I'm like this.

434
00:31:44,424 --> 00:31:47,827
All right, Ruby.
Are you comfortable?

435
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:51,764
What do you want me to do?

436
00:31:51,766 --> 00:31:56,402
Well, I just... I want
to record you, okay?

437
00:31:57,571 --> 00:31:58,571
I want to...

438
00:31:58,573 --> 00:32:03,776
I want to record some of your
stories about the old days...

439
00:32:03,778 --> 00:32:05,444
because, uh...

440
00:32:05,446 --> 00:32:08,748
I mean, what happens
when you're gone, right?

441
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:10,950
I mean, no one's gonna
know what you know.

442
00:32:10,952 --> 00:32:14,587
So, I just want you
to talk, all right?

443
00:32:14,589 --> 00:32:19,959
Just like normal. Forget
that the camera's even here.

444
00:32:20,928 --> 00:32:23,763
What do you want me
to talk about?

445
00:32:25,699 --> 00:32:27,667
Talk about Mom.

446
00:32:34,341 --> 00:32:36,776
Talk about Nicole.

447
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:47,887
What is it?
Uh, there's someone here.

448
00:32:47,889 --> 00:32:52,625
I didn't have an appointment.
It's not a good time.

449
00:32:52,726 --> 00:32:55,628
I think you should
come out here, Kevin.

450
00:33:02,836 --> 00:33:06,205
- Hi.
- Um, my name is Denise Gilcrest,

451
00:33:06,207 --> 00:33:10,543
and this is my...
this is Mike Haley.

452
00:33:10,978 --> 00:33:13,512
What...
What can I do for you?

453
00:33:14,114 --> 00:33:16,349
Well...

454
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:19,085
- Adrienne.
- She's my sister.

455
00:33:19,087 --> 00:33:22,054
- You're Kevin Wolfe, right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

456
00:33:22,056 --> 00:33:25,024
- I took these pictures.
- Have you seen her?

457
00:33:25,026 --> 00:33:30,329
Uh, no. I mean, not for a while.
You know.

458
00:33:30,331 --> 00:33:31,831
Why? Is... Is she...

459
00:33:31,833 --> 00:33:34,800
- She's been missing.
- Missing?

460
00:33:34,802 --> 00:33:38,337
- Did you know her?
- Me? No.

461
00:33:38,339 --> 00:33:41,407
No, I just saw her
when we did the pictures.

462
00:33:41,409 --> 00:33:45,044
But you knew her better than
that, didn't you, Kevin?

463
00:33:45,046 --> 00:33:49,415
Yeah. I mean, we went out one
night, um, and then that was it.

464
00:33:49,417 --> 00:33:52,985
I mean, I called her once after that, and
then we saw each other briefly, but...

465
00:33:52,987 --> 00:33:57,790
- Do you remember what day that was?
- Yeah, that was on...

466
00:33:58,158 --> 00:34:00,626
Uh, when was that?

467
00:34:00,628 --> 00:34:05,364
Uh, no, actually I don't
remember exactly.

468
00:34:05,366 --> 00:34:06,666
Well, where did you go?

469
00:34:06,668 --> 00:34:10,369
We went to a diner on 43rd
Street, and then, uh...

470
00:34:10,371 --> 00:34:12,271
Yeah, are you sure
she didn't just take off?

471
00:34:12,273 --> 00:34:14,573
Is that... I mean, you called
her friends and everything?

472
00:34:14,575 --> 00:34:18,411
If she just took off, she did it
with none of her belongings...

473
00:34:18,413 --> 00:34:20,012
no suitcase, no money, nothing.

474
00:34:20,014 --> 00:34:22,648
The detectives think
it's really unlikely, so...

475
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:25,051
She would have called her
sister, don't you think?

476
00:34:25,053 --> 00:34:29,322
Are the police, like...
Are they helping you guys?

477
00:34:29,324 --> 00:34:29,989
Hardly.

478
00:34:29,991 --> 00:34:34,427
So, can you tell us what you talked
about the last time you saw her?

479
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:39,465
Um, yeah. Well, I gave her these
pictures, and then, uh...

480
00:34:39,467 --> 00:34:42,234
and then, geez, what did we...
then we talked about, um...

481
00:34:42,236 --> 00:34:46,572
Well, we talked about why she
didn't really wanna see me.

482
00:34:46,574 --> 00:34:48,607
She was breaking up with you?

483
00:34:48,609 --> 00:34:53,646
Ye... Well, I mean, we had
hardly left it at that.

484
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:59,685
Do you guys want coffee or...

485
00:35:01,188 --> 00:35:03,222
Hmm.

486
00:35:03,224 --> 00:35:04,323
Oh!

487
00:35:04,325 --> 00:35:07,026
You are one sick motherfucker.

488
00:35:07,028 --> 00:35:10,730
Ah, you're just as interested
in these pictures as I am.

489
00:35:10,732 --> 00:35:12,498
Mm-mmm.

490
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,133
No, I like real girls.

491
00:35:14,135 --> 00:35:17,770
Yeah, but even these girls
won't do it...

492
00:35:17,772 --> 00:35:21,240
unless there's a camera there.

493
00:35:21,242 --> 00:35:21,974
It's true.

494
00:35:21,976 --> 00:35:27,046
The camera... That's what
makes all this magic happen.

495
00:35:27,048 --> 00:35:31,217
You do have a point. Which is exactly
why you became a photographer.

496
00:35:31,219 --> 00:35:35,421
So that you could get girls
to do twisted shit...

497
00:35:35,423 --> 00:35:38,524
like... that.

498
00:35:39,226 --> 00:35:42,261
I don't take pictures like this.

499
00:35:42,729 --> 00:35:45,197
What about that one?

500
00:35:45,966 --> 00:35:48,467
- It's not pornographic.
- She's naked.

501
00:35:48,469 --> 00:35:51,037
Yeah, but it's different.
It's completely different.

502
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:54,740
Oh, yeah. I mean,
if I were you, I would...

503
00:35:54,841 --> 00:36:00,012
I'm not really interested in what their
bodies look like in these pictures.

504
00:36:01,081 --> 00:36:03,149
Would Adrienne do
something like...

505
00:36:03,151 --> 00:36:05,785
that?

506
00:36:06,953 --> 00:36:08,721
No.

507
00:36:10,057 --> 00:36:12,425
See her eyes?

508
00:36:12,626 --> 00:36:17,029
Yeah? Yeah, like, the
way they're flat.

509
00:36:17,031 --> 00:36:19,765
Looks like
she doesn't even care,

510
00:36:19,767 --> 00:36:21,867
like it doesn't even matter.
Yeah.

511
00:36:21,869 --> 00:36:23,436
That's exactly
what I don't like.

512
00:36:23,438 --> 00:36:25,938
When I have a girl
at the studio,

513
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,840
she's, like...

514
00:36:27,842 --> 00:36:29,608
She's doing it for
a whole different reason.

515
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:34,046
She's looking at the camera in a
completely different way, like...

516
00:36:34,048 --> 00:36:37,716
like she's looking out
at you from the inside.

517
00:36:38,251 --> 00:36:40,519
And you see it.

518
00:36:40,521 --> 00:36:43,622
You see that spark.

519
00:36:43,624 --> 00:36:46,125
You see that life.

520
00:36:50,931 --> 00:36:51,931
Good.

521
00:36:51,933 --> 00:36:54,366
Good. This is really good.
Have you modeled before?

522
00:36:54,368 --> 00:36:56,368
No. I'm an actress.

523
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:58,537
I mean, I want to be an actress.

524
00:36:58,539 --> 00:37:01,540
Right. Wolfe Photography. Hello.

525
00:37:01,542 --> 00:37:04,543
Uh, Kevin's busy right now.
Who is it?

526
00:37:04,545 --> 00:37:07,079
Just some girl.
What girl?

527
00:37:07,081 --> 00:37:09,548
Uh, Beth, her name is.

528
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:11,617
Beth.
Give me the phone.

529
00:37:11,619 --> 00:37:14,019
Hold on. Kevin wants
to talk to you.

530
00:37:14,021 --> 00:37:17,356
Hold on for one second.
Beth?

531
00:37:18,458 --> 00:37:20,659
Hi!
Beth from the play, right.

532
00:37:20,661 --> 00:37:24,730
Kevin won a, uh, portrait
award in college.

533
00:37:24,732 --> 00:37:28,901
I don't know if you know that.
It's true.

534
00:37:28,903 --> 00:37:30,736
I'm Jamie, by the way.

535
00:37:30,738 --> 00:37:31,770
I've been doing
Kevin's makeup...

536
00:37:31,772 --> 00:37:35,241
Well, not Kevin's makeup because Kevin
doesn't actually wear any makeup,

537
00:37:35,243 --> 00:37:36,976
but makeup for his clients,
you know.

538
00:37:36,978 --> 00:37:40,112
Girls like you...
actresses and models.

539
00:37:40,114 --> 00:37:42,414
You're not a model, are you?
Mm-mmm.

540
00:37:42,416 --> 00:37:43,482
No. Hmm.

541
00:37:43,484 --> 00:37:45,050
Good. I'm so glad
that you called.

542
00:37:45,052 --> 00:37:48,621
<i>Your pitch
was pretty hard to forget.</i>

543
00:37:48,623 --> 00:37:51,891
Remember Beth? Hmm?

544
00:37:52,359 --> 00:37:53,859
Those big, watery eyes.

545
00:37:53,861 --> 00:37:57,630
Her mouth permanently curved
into a half smile.

546
00:37:57,632 --> 00:38:02,468
I'll never forget the day that she looked
me dead in the eye and she said...

547
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:04,470
Okay.

548
00:38:04,472 --> 00:38:06,138
You will?

549
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:08,174
What do you wanna see?

550
00:38:08,176 --> 00:38:10,543
Um, I don't know.
Whatever.

551
00:38:10,545 --> 00:38:13,746
Anything that you wanna see.
You can pick it.

552
00:38:13,748 --> 00:38:16,615
Okay. I'll call you.

553
00:38:16,617 --> 00:38:21,520
Later this afternoon, I'll find
something and I'll call you.

554
00:38:22,155 --> 00:38:25,090
Good.
Okay, yeah, call me.

555
00:38:25,425 --> 00:38:28,127
Good.

556
00:38:28,129 --> 00:38:28,694
Okay.

557
00:38:28,696 --> 00:38:32,431
I was starting
to get giddy inside.

558
00:38:32,433 --> 00:38:35,601
Like all of a sudden,
I had another chance.

559
00:38:35,603 --> 00:38:39,071
It was like Adrienne had never happened.
Forget Adrienne!

560
00:38:39,073 --> 00:38:40,339
Just relax.

561
00:38:40,341 --> 00:38:44,476
I knew exactly what
was gonna happen next.

562
00:38:44,945 --> 00:38:46,779
It was gonna be awesome.

563
00:38:46,781 --> 00:38:51,784
Truly, incredibly,
amazingly fantastic.

564
00:38:51,786 --> 00:38:57,122
Easily the greatest romantic
experience of my entire...

565
00:38:57,124 --> 00:38:57,923
fucking... life.

566
00:38:57,925 --> 00:39:01,093
You're incredibly blotchy.
What are you talking about?

567
00:39:01,095 --> 00:39:05,297
Step away with that thing,
please. Please.

568
00:39:08,535 --> 00:39:12,671
Maybe afterwards
we could grab a bite to eat?

569
00:39:13,707 --> 00:39:15,608
Maybe.

570
00:39:17,644 --> 00:39:20,112
Maybe.

571
00:39:32,692 --> 00:39:35,995
- There's nothing wrong with me, is there?
- No.

572
00:39:35,997 --> 00:39:37,529
He could... He could...

573
00:39:37,531 --> 00:39:39,465
I mean, if I really
made an effort...

574
00:39:39,467 --> 00:39:41,734
You would totally
have to help me, Derek.

575
00:39:41,736 --> 00:39:45,137
Jamie. He could
go for me, right?

576
00:39:45,139 --> 00:39:48,340
Jamie. He's all I ever
think about, Derek.

577
00:39:48,342 --> 00:39:51,777
I know. He's all I
ever have on my mind.

578
00:39:51,779 --> 00:39:57,016
And sometimes I think if I could just get
him away from those girls for one minute,

579
00:39:57,018 --> 00:39:59,785
if I could just get them out
of the fucking picture...

580
00:39:59,787 --> 00:40:01,120
There's always another one.

581
00:40:01,122 --> 00:40:03,756
Maybe you should keep
your options open.

582
00:40:03,758 --> 00:40:05,724
There are a lot of boys
out there.

583
00:40:05,726 --> 00:40:08,894
Kevin can't be
the only one, can he?

584
00:40:08,896 --> 00:40:11,430
He kind of is.

585
00:40:16,169 --> 00:40:18,904
What was she like, Ruby?

586
00:40:18,906 --> 00:40:23,208
What was her...
her personality like?

587
00:40:25,412 --> 00:40:27,313
Oh.

588
00:40:27,315 --> 00:40:30,149
She was full of energy.

589
00:40:30,151 --> 00:40:32,718
She was rambunctious.

590
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,787
Not like you.
You were always quiet,

591
00:40:34,789 --> 00:40:37,523
always such a quiet little boy.

592
00:40:38,892 --> 00:40:42,094
You were very sensitive,
you know.

593
00:40:42,796 --> 00:40:45,597
Oh, but I was so proud of you.

594
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:47,066
So proud.

595
00:40:47,068 --> 00:40:49,535
Of both of you.

596
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:52,905
You were such good children.

597
00:40:52,907 --> 00:40:55,407
A boy and a girl.

598
00:40:57,110 --> 00:41:00,179
Wish your mother
could have seen you.

599
00:41:00,181 --> 00:41:04,183
She never even saw your
sister at all, did she?

600
00:41:04,185 --> 00:41:07,086
She never even saw
what Nicole looked like.

601
00:41:07,088 --> 00:41:11,523
She never... She never got
to see her own daughter.

602
00:41:14,461 --> 00:41:18,964
How could I have lost
my two girls like that?

603
00:41:35,281 --> 00:41:38,150
Hey, hey.
Hey.

604
00:41:38,152 --> 00:41:40,352
Thought I wouldn't make it?

605
00:41:40,354 --> 00:41:42,187
Hmm. I wasn't sure.

606
00:41:42,189 --> 00:41:47,726
Uh, we don't have to see this
particular movie if you don't want to.

607
00:41:47,728 --> 00:41:49,294
I mean, there are
a lot we can go to.

608
00:41:49,296 --> 00:41:53,432
Yeah, this is fine. I really wanted
to see this, you know, so...

609
00:41:53,434 --> 00:41:56,602
And besides, I already
bought the tickets.

610
00:41:56,604 --> 00:41:57,736
Yeah.

611
00:41:57,738 --> 00:42:02,007
Um, do you want some popcorn?
Sure.

612
00:42:47,087 --> 00:42:50,622
La-la-la-la, la-la

613
00:42:50,624 --> 00:42:52,157
La-la

614
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:55,394
La-la-la-la

615
00:43:02,635 --> 00:43:04,536
What about...

616
00:43:05,171 --> 00:43:10,509
What about the day
that she... you know...

617
00:43:11,811 --> 00:43:13,445
in the pool?

618
00:43:13,447 --> 00:43:17,683
Kevin. I can't.

619
00:43:18,718 --> 00:43:21,687
You can't remember?

620
00:43:24,023 --> 00:43:25,924
It was my fault.

621
00:43:25,926 --> 00:43:28,627
I wasn't there.
I wasn't...

622
00:43:29,762 --> 00:43:31,763
I know you tried.

623
00:43:33,166 --> 00:43:36,001
Did you see me?

624
00:43:36,003 --> 00:43:38,871
Did you see me try?

625
00:43:41,207 --> 00:43:45,811
You know what I like to do
sometimes, Derek?

626
00:43:45,813 --> 00:43:53,285
Sometimes I like to imagine that I have
this whole bottle of little blue pills.

627
00:43:53,287 --> 00:43:56,021
Why blue?

628
00:43:56,122 --> 00:44:00,459
I don't know.
I just like the color, I guess.

629
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,962
And then, I take
these little blue pills...

630
00:44:03,964 --> 00:44:09,568
and I line them up
on the bed, one by one.

631
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:10,969
Jamie, why are you
telling me this?

632
00:44:10,971 --> 00:44:15,140
<i>I'm just making
conversation, Derek.</i>

633
00:44:15,308 --> 00:44:19,978
Then I take the pills...

634
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:23,815
and I push them into my mouth.

635
00:44:23,817 --> 00:44:25,751
Past my lips.

636
00:44:26,185 --> 00:44:30,689
But you don't have
any... of those pills.

637
00:44:30,691 --> 00:44:32,624
<i>Do you?</i>

638
00:44:32,626 --> 00:44:34,092
No.

639
00:44:34,094 --> 00:44:38,764
<i>No, of course not. 'Cause if
you did, you would tell me.</i>

640
00:44:38,766 --> 00:44:43,368
I tell you everything, Derek.
You're my sponsor.

641
00:44:43,370 --> 00:44:50,242
I just feel like,
why did she have to call him?

642
00:44:50,244 --> 00:44:52,110
<i>Who, Jamie?</i>

643
00:44:52,112 --> 00:44:56,615
Her name is...
B-E-T-H.

644
00:44:56,617 --> 00:45:00,419
Jamie, I'm... I'm gonna ask
you to do something for me.

645
00:45:00,421 --> 00:45:03,689
I'm gonna put down the phone.

646
00:45:03,691 --> 00:45:06,658
And I want you
to look at yourself.

647
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:10,329
This is gonna sound stupid, but I want
you to look at yourself in the mirror,

648
00:45:10,331 --> 00:45:15,133
and I want you to tell
yourself that you're pretty.

649
00:45:18,538 --> 00:45:23,041
- Did you hear me?
- Are you serious?

650
00:45:23,509 --> 00:45:25,110
<i>Do that for me, Jamie.</i>

651
00:45:25,112 --> 00:45:28,447
Are... Are you gonna stay
on the phone?

652
00:45:28,449 --> 00:45:30,649
<i>I'm right here.</i>

653
00:45:30,651 --> 00:45:33,452
Okay.

654
00:45:42,629 --> 00:45:45,797
You... are...

655
00:45:46,232 --> 00:45:51,503
You... are...

656
00:45:51,505 --> 00:45:56,341
Fuck you.

657
00:45:56,343 --> 00:45:57,843
Go fuck yourself!

658
00:45:57,845 --> 00:45:59,578
I'm not even fucking
kidding around right now.

659
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:03,815
Go fuck yourself,
you stupid piece of shit!

660
00:46:03,817 --> 00:46:05,183
I fucking hate you!

661
00:46:05,185 --> 00:46:10,756
I fucking hate you,
and I want you to fucking die!

662
00:46:18,798 --> 00:46:24,536
The holy crosses

663
00:46:25,071 --> 00:46:28,807
Shit.

664
00:46:29,509 --> 00:46:31,643
Co... Coming.

665
00:46:38,785 --> 00:46:40,619
Did you find her?

666
00:46:40,621 --> 00:46:42,754
No.

667
00:46:42,855 --> 00:46:45,590
Did you ask anyone in the diner?

668
00:46:45,592 --> 00:46:49,461
Nobody remembers
you two being there.

669
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:53,198
Where's your boyfriend?
Kevin.

670
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:57,069
Do you mind if I
ask you a question?

671
00:46:57,071 --> 00:46:59,638
No, not at all.

672
00:47:01,007 --> 00:47:03,075
Did you do something to her?

673
00:47:03,077 --> 00:47:05,277
Listen, I-I...

674
00:47:05,279 --> 00:47:10,248
I am really sorry if something bad has
happened to your sister. I really am.

675
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:14,920
<i>But it was her decision to not
see me anymore, you know?</i>

676
00:47:14,922 --> 00:47:17,456
That was her choice, not mine.

677
00:47:17,458 --> 00:47:21,059
I've just been trying
to forget I ever met her.

678
00:47:22,895 --> 00:47:24,029
I'm sorry.
No, I'm sorry.

679
00:47:24,031 --> 00:47:27,966
I don't know what I'm doing. Just tell me...
Tell me how to help.

680
00:47:27,968 --> 00:47:30,602
I just don't know where she is.

681
00:47:30,604 --> 00:47:33,772
I know. Gee.

682
00:47:33,774 --> 00:47:38,477
I'm so sorry.
No, no, no, no. It's okay.

683
00:47:38,479 --> 00:47:41,213
It's okay.

684
00:48:10,643 --> 00:48:13,011
That was good.
The movie?

685
00:48:13,013 --> 00:48:14,546
Oh, no, the...
the pizza.

686
00:48:14,548 --> 00:48:19,951
Was it, uh, Ray's
Original or Famous Ray's?

687
00:48:19,953 --> 00:48:23,989
Famous Ray's Original.

688
00:48:29,128 --> 00:48:33,632
Um, you can kiss me now.

689
00:48:38,004 --> 00:48:39,504
Really?

690
00:49:18,344 --> 00:49:19,477
Hey, hey.

691
00:49:19,479 --> 00:49:23,515
Sorry. Not, uh... Not yet. What?

692
00:49:27,019 --> 00:49:29,621
Um...

693
00:49:42,735 --> 00:49:48,607
Kevin. Kevin. Kevin,
come on. I said stop.

694
00:49:48,609 --> 00:49:51,209
Shit.
Okay.

695
00:49:51,211 --> 00:49:53,311
Sorry.

696
00:49:55,514 --> 00:49:57,916
I just, uh...

697
00:49:59,552 --> 00:50:03,755
Sorry.
I thought that we had a...

698
00:50:04,590 --> 00:50:05,590
Oh.
Sorry.

699
00:50:05,592 --> 00:50:10,161
No. You're really nice,
you know. Uh...

700
00:50:10,163 --> 00:50:14,833
Nice.
And I really like you.

701
00:50:14,835 --> 00:50:17,068
And... I just...

702
00:50:17,070 --> 00:50:22,507
I just barely know you.
You know? I mean, we just, um...

703
00:50:22,509 --> 00:50:24,142
I just met you.
And I...

704
00:50:24,144 --> 00:50:29,881
I just think, you know,
I gotta wait a little.

705
00:50:29,883 --> 00:50:33,385
I mean, you've just
gotta be patient.

706
00:50:36,289 --> 00:50:38,757
But I love you.

707
00:50:41,594 --> 00:50:45,297
Suddenly, I could see
directly into the future.

708
00:50:45,299 --> 00:50:46,932
Sorry.

709
00:50:47,033 --> 00:50:52,470
I could see the days unfolding in front
of me like pages of a newspaper.

710
00:50:52,472 --> 00:50:54,739
Huh.
What do you mean?

711
00:50:54,741 --> 00:50:59,477
And I realized that Beth
was far, far away.

712
00:50:59,479 --> 00:51:03,848
I would have to forget Beth
with some... severity.

713
00:51:03,850 --> 00:51:05,984
It wouldn't be easy.

714
00:51:06,085 --> 00:51:13,124
Forgetting Beth
would not be easy at all.

715
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:17,495
If I told her the truth... This is bullshit.
I'm sorry. This...

716
00:51:17,497 --> 00:51:21,333
If I told her who I really was...

717
00:51:21,867 --> 00:51:23,101
I probably should go.

718
00:51:23,103 --> 00:51:25,737
She would hate me.

719
00:51:27,807 --> 00:51:28,807
Uh, Kev. Uh...

720
00:51:28,809 --> 00:51:33,578
Why would she go out with me in the first place?
What the fuck is wrong with her?

721
00:51:35,414 --> 00:51:36,414
Kevin...

722
00:51:36,416 --> 00:51:40,118
<i>What the fuck is wrong with me?</i>

723
00:51:41,487 --> 00:51:43,321
I just...

724
00:51:43,889 --> 00:51:48,660
And I guess I hadn't really
forgotten Adrienne after all.

725
00:52:05,378 --> 00:52:09,514
Sometimes nothing can help you forget
a girl better than another one.

726
00:52:09,516 --> 00:52:13,451
Hello?

727
00:52:13,453 --> 00:52:16,254
Hey, it's me.
What are you doing?

728
00:52:16,256 --> 00:52:20,158
<i>What happened to your date?
What date?</i>

729
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:21,426
Oh.

730
00:52:21,428 --> 00:52:24,162
Uh, are you hungry?

731
00:52:24,164 --> 00:52:25,897
No.

732
00:52:25,899 --> 00:52:30,735
- Will you meet me?
- Okay.

733
00:52:30,737 --> 00:52:35,840
The truth is, women are objects.

734
00:52:35,842 --> 00:52:39,144
I mean, the feminists
can say what they want,

735
00:52:39,146 --> 00:52:41,746
but when it comes
right down to it,

736
00:52:41,748 --> 00:52:44,616
girls are made of bones...

737
00:52:44,618 --> 00:52:48,319
and muscle...
and blood.

738
00:52:48,321 --> 00:52:49,954
And you're over there.

739
00:52:49,956 --> 00:52:55,827
You're right behind the camera,
looking at them,

740
00:52:55,829 --> 00:53:00,331
creating a moment,
an object in space.

741
00:53:00,333 --> 00:53:01,666
- And you're saying...
- Smile.

742
00:53:01,668 --> 00:53:05,370
Look this way. And smooth your hair
just back a little off your eye.

743
00:53:05,372 --> 00:53:09,441
<i>- And they're saying...
- How do you want me?</i>

744
00:53:09,875 --> 00:53:12,844
Here?
Like this?

745
00:53:12,846 --> 00:53:16,848
And you're saying... yes.

746
00:53:16,850 --> 00:53:20,685
Yes, I want you exactly...

747
00:53:20,687 --> 00:53:22,787
like...

748
00:53:23,823 --> 00:53:25,323
that.

749
00:53:29,662 --> 00:53:31,529
Like that.

750
00:54:39,265 --> 00:54:40,765
I take the "A" train

751
00:54:40,767 --> 00:54:41,267
No!

752
00:54:46,505 --> 00:54:47,505
Oh, yes!

753
00:54:47,507 --> 00:54:51,409
That's one of the saddest
things I've ever seen.

754
00:54:51,411 --> 00:54:54,012
I'm fine.
And...

755
00:54:54,014 --> 00:54:56,814
- Oh!
- Yes! I got one.

756
00:54:56,816 --> 00:54:57,649
Notice the form.

757
00:54:57,651 --> 00:54:59,851
You're like...
I'm a champion!

758
00:54:59,853 --> 00:55:02,787
Go, Kevin, go!

759
00:55:03,489 --> 00:55:06,257
Your aim... It almost looks like
you're placing it in the gutter.

760
00:55:06,259 --> 00:55:09,093
There.
You want a direct line.

761
00:55:09,095 --> 00:55:13,131
Cool it, cool it, cool it, cool
it, cool it, cool it, cool it

762
00:55:13,133 --> 00:55:16,301
Feel the hot dough

763
00:55:16,303 --> 00:55:17,602
Are you kidding me?
Oh!

764
00:55:17,604 --> 00:55:19,904
Are you kidding me?
Oh!

765
00:55:19,906 --> 00:55:21,940
Oh, my God.
I'm like a bowling genius.

766
00:55:21,942 --> 00:55:23,975
- That is... Wow.
- Oh, my God.

767
00:55:23,977 --> 00:55:24,977
That... Wow.

768
00:55:24,978 --> 00:55:28,913
Is this helping you?

769
00:55:28,915 --> 00:55:31,216
What do you mean?

770
00:55:31,218 --> 00:55:34,052
With that girl.
With Beth.

771
00:55:34,054 --> 00:55:38,690
Is this helping you with
your forgetting thing?

772
00:55:45,497 --> 00:55:49,200
Do you know what I need?
What?

773
00:55:50,369 --> 00:55:52,403
I need whiskey.

774
00:55:53,172 --> 00:55:54,973
Neat.

775
00:55:55,874 --> 00:55:59,110
Do you want to go get a drink?

776
00:55:59,112 --> 00:56:01,279
Yeah.

777
00:56:01,447 --> 00:56:03,381
That would be fantastic.

778
00:56:03,383 --> 00:56:05,383
Okay.

779
00:56:36,883 --> 00:56:38,950
Looks like you caught me.

780
00:56:38,952 --> 00:56:43,454
Mmm. Looks like I did.

781
00:57:00,707 --> 00:57:03,074
My parents are dead.

782
00:57:04,310 --> 00:57:08,579
Or actually, you know, that I...
I never actually met my dad,

783
00:57:08,581 --> 00:57:10,815
so... who knows?

784
00:57:10,817 --> 00:57:13,985
Who knows?
He might still be alive.

785
00:57:13,987 --> 00:57:20,058
Um... And then when I was eight or...
seven.

786
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:22,827
Uh... Something like that...
Eight, seven.

787
00:57:22,829 --> 00:57:28,933
I... had a sister.
Uh, Nicole.

788
00:57:28,935 --> 00:57:34,038
I have a dead sister...
named Nicole.

789
00:57:34,273 --> 00:57:36,841
What-What happened to her?

790
00:57:36,843 --> 00:57:39,143
You know, I don't know.

791
00:57:39,145 --> 00:57:42,680
I, uh... It's hard
for me to remember.

792
00:57:42,682 --> 00:57:44,849
I, uh...

793
00:57:44,851 --> 00:57:47,452
She drowned in the pool.

794
00:57:47,454 --> 00:57:49,587
She drowned?
Yeah.

795
00:57:49,589 --> 00:57:52,290
Oh, my God.

796
00:57:55,294 --> 00:57:57,795
It's okay, Kevin.

797
00:57:57,797 --> 00:58:00,932
Is it?
Yeah.

798
00:58:00,934 --> 00:58:03,668
It's fine.

799
00:58:04,803 --> 00:58:06,938
I don't pay you enough.
Oh, my God.

800
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:08,306
Jamie, I don't.
Come on.

801
00:58:08,308 --> 00:58:11,275
I don't. I mean, here we
are, we're sitting here.

802
00:58:11,277 --> 00:58:14,112
I feel like I can
tell you anything.

803
00:58:14,114 --> 00:58:16,681
You can.
Yeah.

804
00:58:16,683 --> 00:58:18,449
I feel like I can...

805
00:58:18,451 --> 00:58:23,187
I-I can explain myself to you.
You can.

806
00:58:23,189 --> 00:58:25,757
I feel like...

807
00:58:25,759 --> 00:58:27,725
I feel like you understand.

808
00:58:27,727 --> 00:58:29,827
I do, Kevin.
Yeah.

809
00:58:29,829 --> 00:58:33,765
I do.
I-I do understand.

810
00:58:33,767 --> 00:58:37,168
I understand
absolutely everything.

811
00:58:37,170 --> 00:58:41,472
Anything that you could ever
say to me, I would understand.

812
00:58:41,474 --> 00:58:45,410
And there's something that I've
been wanting to tell you too.

813
00:58:45,412 --> 00:58:47,678
For a really long time, okay?
Mm-hmm.

814
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:52,083
And that is that...
I told my mom...

815
00:58:52,085 --> 00:58:55,920
that you were my boyfriend.

816
00:58:55,922 --> 00:58:58,489
And, like, I know
that I shouldn't have.

817
00:58:58,491 --> 00:59:01,058
Oh, and another thing:
I've been following you.

818
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:04,061
When you're with those girls.
Just to make sure you're okay.

819
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:06,764
And I know that I shouldn't
and everything, but I just...

820
00:59:06,766 --> 00:59:08,399
I don't know. I wanted
to make sure you were okay.

821
00:59:08,401 --> 00:59:12,170
And I just felt, like, a little bit
jealous, and, uh... I don't know.

822
00:59:12,172 --> 00:59:18,075
It's just that I've always felt like we
have this amazing connection, you know?

823
00:59:18,077 --> 00:59:19,777
And, like, the first time
I ever met you...

824
00:59:19,779 --> 00:59:22,880
It was like
I was watching again.

825
00:59:22,882 --> 00:59:27,018
I mean, I was there
with Jamie, in the bar,

826
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:28,986
sitting on the hard stool.

827
00:59:28,988 --> 00:59:34,759
But my true self
was actually up in the ceiling,

828
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:39,597
looking down,
watching myself sitting there.

829
00:59:40,132 --> 00:59:42,700
I could see Jamie too.

830
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:59,317
I left you on the bed

831
00:59:59,319 --> 01:00:03,721
And took all the money

832
01:00:10,063 --> 01:00:16,901
Gonna buy you something
to ease the hurt

833
01:00:16,903 --> 01:00:20,838
You're here.

834
01:00:21,807 --> 01:00:24,141
You're here.
I am.

835
01:00:24,576 --> 01:00:27,445
I've loved you for so long.

836
01:00:30,048 --> 01:00:31,048
I know.

837
01:00:31,050 --> 01:00:36,287
I've always loved you.

838
01:00:36,289 --> 01:00:38,623
I know.

839
01:00:38,625 --> 01:00:40,992
It's okay.

840
01:00:41,159 --> 01:00:44,228
Okay.

841
01:00:46,131 --> 01:00:49,033
This is Jean. Jean.

842
01:00:49,035 --> 01:00:53,170
Forgotten after
a full-release body massage.

843
01:00:55,274 --> 01:00:56,807
Oh, this is Fiona.

844
01:00:56,809 --> 01:01:02,380
Uh... I forgot Fiona by joining
a gym I never ended up going to.

845
01:01:02,781 --> 01:01:08,619
Brenda. I forgot Brenda
at the Museum of Modern Art.

846
01:01:09,087 --> 01:01:12,456
I forgot... Mary.

847
01:01:12,458 --> 01:01:14,191
Forgot Sarah.

848
01:01:14,193 --> 01:01:16,894
Forgot Kelly.

849
01:01:16,896 --> 01:01:18,763
I forgot...

850
01:01:19,932 --> 01:01:22,266
Forgot.

851
01:01:22,268 --> 01:01:24,402
Forgot.

852
01:01:24,404 --> 01:01:26,604
Forgot.

853
01:01:56,935 --> 01:01:59,303
Holy shit.

854
01:02:13,852 --> 01:02:16,020
I had to do something radical,

855
01:02:16,022 --> 01:02:19,624
something to forget all this
in a major way.

856
01:02:19,626 --> 01:02:21,726
I was really going
out of my mind, I admit.

857
01:02:21,728 --> 01:02:24,795
And I don't think I knew...
I mean, I...

858
01:02:24,797 --> 01:02:27,632
I knew what was going on,
what was happening.

859
01:02:27,634 --> 01:02:31,702
But I had to find some way
of canceling it all out.

860
01:02:31,704 --> 01:02:35,773
Of forgetting Beth,
forgetting Adrienne...

861
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:40,077
and especially forgetting Jamie.

862
01:02:46,985 --> 01:02:50,087
I had to forget Jamie.

863
01:03:23,689 --> 01:03:27,525
Kevie. Kevie!

864
01:03:28,093 --> 01:03:29,493
Kevin!

865
01:03:29,495 --> 01:03:32,663
I really feel that we
made this... this connection.

866
01:03:32,665 --> 01:03:35,232
I'm really sorry, Kevin.
But I love you.

867
01:03:35,234 --> 01:03:36,934
What do you mean?

868
01:03:36,936 --> 01:03:39,003
I feel like
I can tell you anything.

869
01:03:39,005 --> 01:03:43,274
I've been following
you. I've always loved you.

870
01:03:53,251 --> 01:03:55,019
Beth.

871
01:03:55,021 --> 01:03:57,521
What are you doing here?
Oh.

872
01:03:57,523 --> 01:04:01,225
I thought you were someone else.
Ow.

873
01:04:03,361 --> 01:04:06,063
Poor Beth.

874
01:04:06,065 --> 01:04:09,867
She couldn't have known
what I was doing this for.

875
01:04:09,869 --> 01:04:12,903
But once I started,

876
01:04:14,506 --> 01:04:16,807
I had to keep going.

877
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:30,254
Come on.

878
01:04:30,256 --> 01:04:33,390
I had to forget about
all this somehow.

879
01:04:34,893 --> 01:04:36,761
Kevie. Kevie!

880
01:04:36,763 --> 01:04:40,331
<i>I just wish I could remember more
about Nicole, you know? Kevie!</i>

881
01:04:40,333 --> 01:04:43,768
What the hell was she doing in that pool anyway?
She wasn't allowed.

882
01:04:43,770 --> 01:04:48,139
She was too little to swim. I
mean, I could barely swim myself.

883
01:04:51,543 --> 01:04:54,612
What was I supposed to do?

884
01:04:54,813 --> 01:04:57,681
How was I supposed to save her?

885
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:23,808
What are we gonna do with her?

886
01:05:27,245 --> 01:05:29,313
How did you get in?

887
01:05:31,016 --> 01:05:34,051
I finally got a key made.

888
01:05:36,788 --> 01:05:38,722
Oh.

889
01:05:41,626 --> 01:05:46,363
Why don't you go hop in the
shower, and I'll clean up here.

890
01:05:52,003 --> 01:05:53,270
Go.

891
01:06:14,025 --> 01:06:19,697
In the past I was a man

892
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:26,937
But now I'm a ghost
with dirty hands

893
01:06:28,074 --> 01:06:32,376
I stain the ground
as I crawl to you

894
01:06:35,580 --> 01:06:39,216
I stain the ground
as I move on through

895
01:06:39,218 --> 01:06:41,585
Good.

896
01:06:41,587 --> 01:06:45,656
Good. And tilt... Tilt your head a
little to the left. A little more.

897
01:06:45,658 --> 01:06:46,824
Yeah. Completely.

898
01:06:46,826 --> 01:06:49,793
In the dark I cannot sleep

899
01:06:49,795 --> 01:06:53,397
Good. That's good.

900
01:06:53,732 --> 01:06:59,403
<i>- I can't escape these thoughts that creep
- Hmm.</i>

901
01:07:03,408 --> 01:07:05,309
Good. Look this way.

902
01:07:05,311 --> 01:07:07,578
Great.
Yeah, let's see that smile.

903
01:07:07,580 --> 01:07:10,314
Good. Good.

904
01:07:10,316 --> 01:07:12,016
Perfect.

905
01:07:12,951 --> 01:07:15,686
Move your hair.

906
01:07:19,457 --> 01:07:24,895
A shadow descending to be a man

907
01:07:30,201 --> 01:07:32,970
Why don't you sit up here?

908
01:07:32,972 --> 01:07:34,038
Me?

909
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:36,840
- Just for one shot.-

910
01:07:36,842 --> 01:07:38,742
Mmm.
My makeup is a mess.

911
01:07:38,744 --> 01:07:40,978
No, that's okay. It's not
a glamour shot, Jamie.

912
01:07:40,980 --> 01:07:45,783
Plus, I just... I don't have any
pictures of you, that's all.

913
01:07:53,825 --> 01:07:55,993
Let's see.

914
01:08:08,807 --> 01:08:15,212
- You know, Jamie, I've been thinking about...
- I'm not gonna tell anyone.

915
01:08:15,214 --> 01:08:17,047
I know.

916
01:08:17,349 --> 01:08:20,551
I know that you
wouldn't do that. But...

917
01:08:21,619 --> 01:08:24,088
You have to understand, I...

918
01:08:24,090 --> 01:08:28,559
I can't go around
remembering all of this.

919
01:08:29,327 --> 01:08:33,697
You know?
I have to forget.

920
01:08:34,766 --> 01:08:37,935
Well-Well,
what about last night?

921
01:08:37,937 --> 01:08:40,504
Do you have to forget...

922
01:08:51,850 --> 01:08:55,252
Jamie,

923
01:08:55,254 --> 01:08:57,755
last night was...

924
01:08:59,624 --> 01:09:01,225
a mistake.

925
01:09:01,227 --> 01:09:01,727
Oh.

926
01:09:05,631 --> 01:09:08,232
Do you know what I mean?

927
01:09:17,443 --> 01:09:21,045
It's okay.

928
01:09:21,047 --> 01:09:23,247
It's okay.

929
01:09:24,149 --> 01:09:26,483
It's okay.

930
01:09:27,018 --> 01:09:31,355
'Cause I... I have been
thinking about something...

931
01:09:31,357 --> 01:09:34,792
for a really long time.

932
01:09:34,794 --> 01:09:37,728
And I even told Derek about it.

933
01:09:37,730 --> 01:09:41,065
And he's trying
to talk me out of it, but...

934
01:09:41,067 --> 01:09:47,037
I've got a whole...
whole fucking bottle.

935
01:09:47,039 --> 01:09:50,240
Of what?

936
01:09:50,242 --> 01:09:52,709
Blue pills.

937
01:09:53,244 --> 01:09:55,846
Blue.

938
01:09:56,548 --> 01:09:58,415
Blue.

939
01:09:59,417 --> 01:10:03,921
Jamie, it's gonna be beautiful.

940
01:10:04,856 --> 01:10:06,723
It's gonna be so beautiful.

941
01:10:06,725 --> 01:10:08,859
You.
Beautiful?

942
01:10:08,861 --> 01:10:09,960
You...

943
01:10:09,962 --> 01:10:13,697
are gonna be so beautiful.

944
01:10:13,699 --> 01:10:16,500
Beautiful.
So beautiful.

945
01:10:18,070 --> 01:10:21,472
So beautiful.
I promise.

946
01:10:22,907 --> 01:10:24,308
I promise.

947
01:10:24,310 --> 01:10:28,545
I'll give you something.

948
01:10:30,982 --> 01:10:35,185
I wanna be beautiful
for you, Kevin.

949
01:10:35,453 --> 01:10:39,289
I wanna be beautiful for you.

950
01:10:46,231 --> 01:10:50,968
Kevin, if you are watching this,

951
01:10:50,970 --> 01:10:54,505
that means that you found me.

952
01:10:54,672 --> 01:10:58,041
And I just want you to know...

953
01:10:58,043 --> 01:11:02,679
<i>why I killed Beth Dalewell
in your studio.</i>

954
01:11:02,681 --> 01:11:04,982
<i>And also,</i>

955
01:11:04,984 --> 01:11:10,454
<i>why I took Adrienne
Gilcrest's life too.</i>

956
01:11:12,123 --> 01:11:14,758
<i>I guess I was jealous.</i>

957
01:11:15,260 --> 01:11:20,230
And now I have nothing left...

958
01:11:20,232 --> 01:11:22,166
<i>to live for.</i>

959
01:11:22,168 --> 01:11:25,669
<i>I have nothing left.</i>

960
01:11:26,104 --> 01:11:28,038
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

961
01:11:30,475 --> 01:11:33,277
This is Adrienne.

962
01:11:33,279 --> 01:11:36,446
I forgot her on a camping trip.

963
01:11:39,884 --> 01:11:42,386
This is Beth.

964
01:11:42,388 --> 01:11:44,254
Forgotten.

965
01:11:45,456 --> 01:11:48,926
And this is Jamie.

966
01:12:03,375 --> 01:12:07,244
Where did you get these anyway?

967
01:12:07,246 --> 01:12:09,680
A doctor.

968
01:12:09,682 --> 01:12:11,481
Said I was nervous.

969
01:12:11,483 --> 01:12:17,187
You should wipe your fingerprints
off the bottle, don't you think?

970
01:12:17,189 --> 01:12:19,156
Don't worry.

971
01:12:21,526 --> 01:12:25,229
What if it doesn't work?

972
01:12:25,730 --> 01:12:28,632
It'll work.

973
01:12:46,351 --> 01:12:48,652
Kevin.

974
01:12:49,554 --> 01:12:51,955
Can I keep my clothes on?

975
01:12:51,957 --> 01:12:56,426
Sure. Sure,
you can keep 'em on.

976
01:16:18,664 --> 01:16:23,900
If you're watching this, you've
discovered something you shouldn't have.

977
01:16:31,643 --> 01:16:33,610
Anyway, um...

978
01:16:34,011 --> 01:16:38,482
This... This is a close-up
of a model's eye.

979
01:16:38,484 --> 01:16:43,954
I can't remember her name to save my life,
but she had the bluest eyes I'd ever seen.

980
01:16:43,956 --> 01:16:49,359
The only other time I remember seeing
this exact intensity of blue...

981
01:16:49,361 --> 01:16:52,462
was the day my sister drowned.

982
01:16:52,864 --> 01:16:55,098
It was everywhere...

983
01:16:55,333 --> 01:17:00,770
in the water, in the sky,
Nicole's skin.

984
01:17:00,772 --> 01:17:01,838
Blue.

985
01:17:06,078 --> 01:17:10,447
Nicole. She's the one girl
I keep trying to remember.

986
01:17:10,449 --> 01:17:13,917
But I... I think
she's the problem.

987
01:17:13,919 --> 01:17:17,821
I think...
I think she's the reason...

988
01:17:17,823 --> 01:17:21,658
I am the way I am, right?

989
01:17:31,135 --> 01:17:34,371
This is what it looked like,
these flashes of white.

990
01:17:34,373 --> 01:17:37,340
It was like this empty slide.

991
01:17:37,708 --> 01:17:41,978
The sun was flashing
off the water.

992
01:17:42,146 --> 01:17:44,548
It was just like this.

993
01:17:49,620 --> 01:17:52,088
Jesus.

994
01:17:56,060 --> 01:17:58,495
I watched her.

995
01:18:01,399 --> 01:18:04,034
I watched the whole thing.

996
01:18:06,370 --> 01:18:10,040
Through the blue and the gold
and the white flashes.

997
01:18:12,176 --> 01:18:14,444
The white...

998
01:18:14,446 --> 01:18:16,146
flashes.

999
01:18:16,148 --> 01:18:17,614
Flashes.

1000
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:25,522
Kevie!

1001
01:18:25,856 --> 01:18:28,658
Kevin!

1002
01:18:33,966 --> 01:18:34,466
Kevin!

1003
01:18:39,236 --> 01:18:42,973
Help me! Somebody help!

1004
01:18:42,975 --> 01:18:46,109
Do you remember
what happened, sweetheart?

1005
01:18:46,111 --> 01:18:48,678
I just don't remember.

1006
01:18:54,819 --> 01:18:57,220
I watched her.

1007
01:18:58,689 --> 01:19:02,258
I was looking through the light.

1008
01:19:03,060 --> 01:19:05,562
Into the heart of the light.

1009
01:19:05,963 --> 01:19:08,231
Into the silence.

1010
01:19:11,135 --> 01:19:14,971
I knew my baby sister
was drowning.

1011
01:19:16,374 --> 01:19:18,742
And I let it happen.

1012
01:19:24,115 --> 01:19:26,316
I watched it...

1013
01:19:27,685 --> 01:19:30,086
because it was beautiful.

1014
01:19:33,491 --> 01:19:35,058
I let it happen...

1015
01:19:35,060 --> 01:19:39,529
because it was beautiful to see.

1016
01:19:58,783 --> 01:20:03,086
Under the water,
Nicole called my name.

1017
01:20:03,954 --> 01:20:06,790
What I saw
were flashes of light.

1018
01:20:07,892 --> 01:20:10,060
And what I heard...

1019
01:20:10,661 --> 01:20:13,496
What did I hear?

1020
01:20:13,631 --> 01:20:17,967
Put your hands over your ears.

1021
01:20:19,503 --> 01:20:21,738
Press down.

1022
01:21:21,365 --> 01:21:27,303
I know it's hard to tell
how mixed up you feel

1023
01:21:27,305 --> 01:21:32,475
Hoping what you need
is behind every door

1024
01:21:32,477 --> 01:21:37,580
Each time you get hurt,
I don't want you to change

1025
01:21:37,582 --> 01:21:42,719
'Cause everyone has hopes
You're human after all

1026
01:21:42,721 --> 01:21:48,558
The feeling sometimes, wishing
you were someone else

1027
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:53,496
Feeling as though
you never belong

1028
01:21:53,498 --> 01:21:58,935
This feeling is not sadness
This feeling is not joy

1029
01:21:58,937 --> 01:22:05,775
I truly understand
Please don't cry now

1030
01:22:07,311 --> 01:22:12,182
Please don't go
I want you to stay

1031
01:22:12,184 --> 01:22:17,187
I'm begging you, please
Please don't leave here

1032
01:22:17,189 --> 01:22:22,725
I don't want you to hate for
all the hurt that you feel

1033
01:22:22,727 --> 01:22:29,432
The world is just illusion
trying to change you

1034
01:22:31,168 --> 01:22:36,439
Being like you are
Well, this is something else

1035
01:22:36,441 --> 01:22:42,178
Who would comprehend?
But some that do lay claim

1036
01:22:42,180 --> 01:22:46,983
Divine purpose blesses them

1037
01:22:46,985 --> 01:22:49,886
Well, that's not what I believe

1038
01:22:49,888 --> 01:22:52,889
And it doesn't matter anyway

1039
01:22:52,891 --> 01:22:57,727
A part of your soul
ties you to the next world

1040
01:22:57,729 --> 01:23:02,732
Or maybe to the last,
but I'm still not sure

1041
01:23:02,734 --> 01:23:08,204
But what I do know is
to us the world is different

1042
01:23:08,206 --> 01:23:14,611
As we are to the world
I guess you would know that

1043
01:23:16,647 --> 01:23:21,384
Please don't go
I want you to stay

1044
01:23:21,386 --> 01:23:26,489
I'm begging you, please
Please don't leave here

1045
01:23:26,491 --> 01:23:32,061
I don't want you to hate for
all the hurt that you feel

1046
01:23:32,063 --> 01:23:37,800
The world is just illusion
trying to change you

1047
01:23:37,802 --> 01:23:42,639
Please don't go
I want you to stay

1048
01:23:42,641 --> 01:23:47,844
I'm begging you, please
Oh, please don't leave here

1049
01:23:47,846 --> 01:23:53,283
I don't want you to change for
all the hurt that you feel

1050
01:23:53,285 --> 01:23:59,989
This world is just illusion
always trying to change you

1051
01:24:31,288 --> 01:24:36,125
Please don't go
I want you to stay

1052
01:24:36,127 --> 01:24:41,164
I'm begging you, please
Please don't leave here

1053
01:24:41,166 --> 01:24:46,636
I don't want you to hate for
all the hurt that you feel

1054
01:24:46,638 --> 01:24:52,508
The world is just illusion
trying to change you

1055
01:24:52,510 --> 01:24:57,313
Please don't go
I want you to stay

1056
01:24:57,315 --> 01:25:02,552
I'm begging you, please
Oh, please don't leave here

1057
01:25:02,554 --> 01:25:07,890
I don't want you to change for
all the hurt that you feel

1058
01:25:07,892 --> 01:25:14,931
This world is just illusion
always trying to change you
