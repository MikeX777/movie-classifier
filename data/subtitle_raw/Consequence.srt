1
00:00:30,664 --> 00:00:33,190
They say things happen for a reason.

2
00:00:33,734 --> 00:00:36,669
That everything is part of some grand plan.

3
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:40,268
The truth is there are actions,
and there are consequences.

4
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,172
We live and die by them.

5
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:45,177
And somewhere in this mess
{ calf "the fife"...

6
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:46,872
it just clicked.

7
00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:50,610
The perfect plan.

8
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:56,814
Such a plan.

9
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:01,456
God knows [ never meant to hurt anyone.

10
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:17,903
Made a match on the Moreling case?

11
00:01:18,312 --> 00:01:19,336
Yeah.

12
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,841
I was able to rebuild his jaw here,
and the bite mark...

13
00:01:26,787 --> 00:01:28,585
South America again?

14
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:32,182
Getting out a week from Friday,
lest you forget.

15
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:36,619
You're wasting your talents here.

16
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:38,922
You let me do my thing...

17
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:43,098
and the dead patients don't sue.
I find that gratifying.

18
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,538
I know a lot of places
they'd kill for a brilliant oral surgeon.

19
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:49,008
Places that wouldn't give
a shit about your past.

20
00:01:49,076 --> 00:01:53,274
Or the fact that some supermodel got lucky
in court and ruined your career.

21
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:58,810
She's publishing a book now
about her ordeal.

22
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:01,479
Got a reporter stirring
up all that crap again.

23
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:04,752
- You'd think, after four years...
- Yeah, you got a raw deal.

24
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:09,358
Don't ever think I take for granted
what you did for me.

25
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:12,288
You've been a real friend.

26
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:14,832
I mean that.

27
00:02:16,103 --> 00:02:20,438
Nothing. Just sort of misplaced a body...

28
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,302
maybe.

29
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,840
One of these days,
I want a ride in your plane.

30
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,552
You better make it soon.
My wife's threatened to liquidate that, too.

31
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:50,704
Know what the most valuable thing
in this world is?

32
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:53,763
Your good name. Your reputation.

33
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:57,504
You dirty your name,
you can never wash it clean.

34
00:02:58,045 --> 00:03:01,071
It's the only part of you that lives forever.

35
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,479
Dr. Tyler?

36
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,682
Hi. Maury Newman.

37
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:26,791
We talked on the phone. I'm writing
the book about Ashley Commerford.

38
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,055
Oh, yeah.

39
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:30,790
It's going to print in five days.

40
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:34,366
You could still be the final chapter.

41
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:38,533
She lied and ruined my life.
What else do you want to know?

42
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,330
I don't get it.

43
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:43,468
Why wouldn't you want to tell
your side of the story?

44
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:47,207
- What's the story you're looking for?
- "Justice isn't blind to beauty."

45
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,308
If she hadn't been a top model,
none of this would have happened to you.

46
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:56,114
Come on, Doctor! Think about it.
This isn't exactly your old BMW, is it?

47
00:05:57,591 --> 00:05:59,252
I don't need my old BMW.

48
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:02,387
I need to go to the store
without people whispering behind me.

49
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:04,863
Or sticking cameras
where they don't belong.

50
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:06,592
Do you understand?

51
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:24,978
She's in every magazine,
on every daytime show.

52
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,712
The infection was foreseeable.

53
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:30,689
You should tell your side of the story.
You can't take the high road.

54
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:33,124
You did nothing wrong. We'll appeal.

55
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:35,560
What happened to her face is a tragedy.

56
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:39,395
He explicitly warned Miss Commerford
not to travel to Thailand.

57
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:28,147
Evening, Kye.

58
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:34,154
Got another foreclosure notice today.

59
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,154
Did that reporter get hold of you?

60
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:39,055
Yeah, he ambushed me
right outside the office.

61
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:42,089
Wants me on some rancid TV show.

62
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:46,656
- Nothing fucking works in this house.
- Play the part of some helpless victim.

63
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:50,735
- We can't eat pride, Max.
- Then spend less.

64
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,497
That wasn't the deal.
I married a doctor, not a mortician.

65
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:58,533
I'm just getting a little more respect
these days from the dead.

66
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:01,742
- What are you gonna do?
- Sell the plane.

67
00:08:02,382 --> 00:08:03,975
Then we'll have some cash.

68
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,882
Honey, at your pace...

69
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:07,716
we're not gonna have any cash.

70
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:10,381
As it is, you're living on bounced checks.

71
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:14,392
So what is this?
Another 80-proof night in the town?

72
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:17,888
I still haven't given up on my life.

73
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:40,045
Everyone always said my brother
was the good one.

74
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,181
A heart so big,
you could pour an ocean into it.

75
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,951
Could have made a fortune,
never broke a sweat.

76
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:51,494
All that made him happy was putting a smile
on some hungry kid's face.

77
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:55,930
I remember the day his boat exploded
in Guatemala.

78
00:08:57,404 --> 00:09:00,237
That's the day I stopped believing in God.

79
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:22,652
Stop it. Go home, Romeo.

80
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:06,068
Sit down, Dr. Tyler.

81
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:18,410
- Have you chosen your PIN number?
- Yes.

82
00:10:25,592 --> 00:10:28,493
- What's the matter?
- God, not here.

83
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,661
Where, then?

84
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:36,597
Come on.

85
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,805
The trust account's in your name now.

86
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:42,539
I'm the executive on the account.

87
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:47,035
You're the only one
who can use that PIN code.

88
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:49,682
Not even your lawyer can use that.

89
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:55,182
My wife, Kye, can't freeze anything now?

90
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,345
No.

91
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,188
You gotta write her out.

92
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:03,290
You don't give her anything.
She doesn't get shit.

93
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:05,826
She's a lazy bitch.

94
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:13,396
I'm gonna come.

95
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:33,084
You better relax.

96
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,075
Wendy, I'd like to see you
in my office, please.

97
00:11:53,246 --> 00:11:56,546
If something comes up,
you got $3,000 in the box downstairs.

98
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:59,149
Fuck, we're really gonna do this.

99
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,847
After four years of hard labor, honey,
I sure hope so.

100
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:03,252
Hi, Wendy.

101
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,385
- What the hell was that?
- Professional jealousy.

102
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:12,120
- Thank you for choosing New Union.
- Thank you.

103
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:14,526
The service here is outstanding.

104
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:31,208
Roger, Delta One.
We have received your distress call.

105
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:33,514
Can we have your coordinates, please?

106
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,120
Delta One, do you copy?

107
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:46,193
Delta One, come in.

108
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:51,869
Delta One, do you copy?

109
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:45,742
My brother was about to live again.

110
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:49,282
Man...

111
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:52,720
you wouldn't find this place on any map.

112
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:19,639
Mr. Salent?

113
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:23,345
You're ready?

114
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:34,484
It's not a real burn.

115
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:37,522
The prints will grow back in a month or two.

116
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:40,660
The face...

117
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:48,868
May I see the face?

118
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:07,320
{ wondered,
“ "Would anyone really miss Dr. Max Tyler?"”

119
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:15,699
At least Maury Newman would have
a perfect closing chapter to his story.

120
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:28,846
Yeah, it's Max. No doubt.

121
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:33,143
He's got a lot of life insurance.
Any signs of foul play?

122
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:37,947
That's it, then.
Insurance company will take it from here.

123
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:39,753
Sorry about your friend.

124
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:42,021
Cut the legal horseshit.

125
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:43,456
Here's the deal.

126
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:47,488
Of the three insurance notes, $3 million
is to be paid into a charitable trust...

127
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,433
to be managed by Eva Cruz.

128
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:55,064
You will receive the house
and all other assets...

129
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:58,839
including a Meissen mantel clock,
an original Pekkari print...

130
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,936
and a '92 Chevy Tahoe...

131
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:05,507
I spent the last four years in hell, and if
this tramp thinks she's gonna get a cent...

132
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:08,748
- Listen, you never even cared for him...
- It's my money, you whore!

133
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:10,448
Hold on!

134
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:14,259
- I'll fucking kill you!
- Ladies, stop it!

135
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:17,459
Checkmate.

136
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:24,696
What did you find unique
about your brother?

137
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:33,479
I think my brother had a compassion.

138
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:39,310
He had a compassion for people that I don't.

139
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,549
They used to say he had the heart...

140
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:44,949
I had the brains.

141
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,356
I envied that son of a bitch.

142
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:51,926
Brother, would you relax?

143
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,764
What are you so scared of, Max?

144
00:18:56,002 --> 00:18:58,437
I'll never let nothing bad happen to you.

145
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:02,131
My man! Yeah. Give me five!

146
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:07,439
Relax.

147
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:11,776
It's just Captain Cordillo.
Give me those cigarettes.

148
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:14,445
Just bribe him with a few cigarettes...

149
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:16,915
he lets me help the people.

150
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,127
Only the good die young?

151
00:19:23,796 --> 00:19:25,662
Guatemala, back in '92.

152
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,800
He was a human rights activist.

153
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,503
"Hand in hand,
all headlong hurl ourselves..."

154
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:40,873
"And on the ragged stones,
beat forth our brains..."

155
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:44,139
"To make a mutual closure of our house."

156
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:52,119
- Mister, have a cigar?
- All right.

157
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:56,390
- Two cigars?
- You take every last dollar I have, okay?

158
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:58,160
Thank you.

159
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:02,434
- Ball for sale, sir.
- No, thank you.

160
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:32,926
Hi, you've reached Eva Cruz, please leave...

161
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:34,329
Mr. Tyler.

162
00:20:39,939 --> 00:20:42,033
When did you lose your passport?

163
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:44,702
That's why I'm here.
I haven't the faintest recollection.

164
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:49,973
Mr. Tyler, are you aware
that you've been missing for eight years?

165
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:53,110
The world had pretty much written you off...

166
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:55,084
as deceased.

167
00:20:56,422 --> 00:21:00,859
If that's the consensus,
I'm just gonna say the world's wrong.

168
00:21:01,861 --> 00:21:04,091
Where have you been, Mr. Tyler?

169
00:21:04,163 --> 00:21:07,599
As I said, I was in the south.
I was with the Indians.

170
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,262
And had you been held against your will
or anything like that?

171
00:21:12,338 --> 00:21:14,238
No, I was in Guatemala.

172
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,375
I was traveling up the Machaquila River.

173
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,741
Evidently, there was a fire
in the engine room...

174
00:21:19,812 --> 00:21:21,780
and subsequently an explosion.

175
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:23,281
So you don't remember?

176
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:27,047
When they fished me out,
I was suffering from a concussion.

177
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:32,021
- A prolonged amnesia can be serious.
- Quite frankly, it's been hell.

178
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:35,120
But I'm feeling fine now.
In fact, I feel good.

179
00:21:36,095 --> 00:21:38,393
Just wanna get my passport back.

180
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:43,925
Repatriation requires certain protocols,
and should everything check out...

181
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:46,597
then you should be home
in a couple of days.

182
00:21:48,841 --> 00:21:52,835
Jeffrey, if you could process Mr. Tyler
for repatriation, please?

183
00:22:02,288 --> 00:22:03,915
Since we can't use your prints...

184
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:07,448
it's gonna take an extra day
summoning your dental records.

185
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,542
Please enter your account code now.

186
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:40,757
Your balance is $3 million.

187
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,657
For any other services, please press 1.

188
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:46,323
No, that's good, that's real good.

189
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:48,967
Yes, sirree bob.

190
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:21,232
Yeah?

191
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,429
Is something wrong?

192
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:26,061
{ just ran up the stairs. You okay?

193
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:28,135
Where have you been?

194
00:23:28,207 --> 00:23:32,542
Running around, getting stuff ready.
They screwed up our plane tickets.

195
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,907
How is the Kye situation?

196
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:38,674
{ think we're home free.

197
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:41,881
God, I can't wait to see what you look like.

198
00:23:41,954 --> 00:23:44,355
I look good, I look real good.

199
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:49,925
Things are gonna be a lot more fun
being him than it was being me.

200
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:51,993
Hurry. I want you to hurry.

201
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:54,761
I'm gonna fill up the tub with champagne.

202
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,323
Eva, listen to me.

203
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:00,836
I love you.

204
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:04,073
I'm gonna call you as soon as I land.
All right?

205
00:24:04,143 --> 00:24:07,443
Okay. { love you, foo. Bye.

206
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:30,932
Mr. Tyler?

207
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:39,441
I'm afraid I've got some bad news for you.

208
00:24:40,012 --> 00:24:42,003
Pay your parking tickets.

209
00:24:44,717 --> 00:24:45,946
Private.

210
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:50,354
- Good luck, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

211
00:25:30,596 --> 00:25:33,122
- Welcome home, Mr. Tyler.
- Thank you.

212
00:26:26,552 --> 00:26:28,611
Welcome to New Union Bank.

213
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:31,816

215
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:38,519

217
00:26:50,876 --> 00:26:54,642
Thank you. Your account balance is zero.

For other services, please press 1.

219
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:09,121
I'll stay calm when you tell me
how six hours ago I had $3 million...

220
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:10,855
and now I'm sitting with fuck-all?

221
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:13,398
There was a wire transfer authorized
this afternoon.

222
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,433
I did not authorize a wire transfer!

223
00:27:15,501 --> 00:27:19,062
You need a fucking PIN code
to authorize a wire transfer!

224
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:22,199
Your PIN authorization
is on the transfer, sir.

225
00:27:31,717 --> 00:27:32,946
Good morning.

226
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:37,650
That's a nice silk scarf you're wearing.
It complements your eyes.

227
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:40,018
- Thank you.
- Maybe you could help me.

228
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:42,493
I just got off a plane. I'm so damned tired.

229
00:27:42,728 --> 00:27:44,753
I'm conducting an inquiry.

230
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:48,596
Actually, it's a case of fraud.
I'm working for an insurance firm.

231
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:51,364
Let me get this straight for you.
You got a...

232
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:54,565
You had an employee by the name of Eva.

233
00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:56,804
Eva Cruz.

234
00:27:57,843 --> 00:28:00,141
If she would have left
a forwarding address...

235
00:28:00,212 --> 00:28:04,308
that would certainly serve our purposes.

236
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:08,610
- You're an investigator?
- Yes, ma'am.

237
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:12,783
I knew there was something off about her.

238
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:15,926
Some loser died
and left her in charge of a chunk of money.

239
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:18,520
She sailed out of here like royalty.

240
00:28:18,764 --> 00:28:22,826
I bet she gets a big kick out of us having
to serve her as a prime client now.

241
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:25,165
All her settlement is still in this bank?

242
00:28:25,237 --> 00:28:27,865
She's transferring the money
to a bank in the Caymans.

243
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,533
But I'm having it held.

244
00:28:29,608 --> 00:28:33,806
She had someone cut corners trying
to move the money out of the trust it was in.

245
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:36,678
So I'm making her come in to sign a waiver.

246
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:39,944
She's coming here?

247
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,316
When is she coming in here?

248
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:45,948
Now.

249
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,242
Oh, my God.

250
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:22,704
Max?

251
00:31:25,851 --> 00:31:28,616
- How did you find us?
- Look at your face.

252
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:33,081
You!

253
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:35,986
Get the fuck off!

254
00:31:45,771 --> 00:31:47,364
What did you do?

255
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,298
What the fuck is this?

256
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:53,934
Stop it, Max!

257
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:57,810
Stop it!

258
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:02,283
Where the fuck is it?

259
00:32:41,827 --> 00:32:43,818
Now we know where we all stand.

260
00:32:46,498 --> 00:32:47,863
Look at you, Max.

261
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,065
Look at yourself.

262
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:55,439
Never give your trust to anyone.

263
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:58,967
It's the cardinal rule of hustling, right?

264
00:32:59,578 --> 00:33:01,239
Shut the fuck up.

265
00:33:02,881 --> 00:33:05,873
You know, Kye and I, we go way back.

266
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:07,985
Back to the old days.

267
00:33:08,053 --> 00:33:11,045
As soon as she found out
what you were up to, she called me.

268
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:13,050
The rest was easy.

269
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:14,421
Will you fucking shut up?

270
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:16,894
Should have kept her in the money, Max.

271
00:33:23,268 --> 00:33:26,431
You stop that transfer.
You withdraw everything. You hear me?

272
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:29,907
The reality of a divorce
is that you split things evenly.

273
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:33,334
The way I see it,
there are three of us standing here.

274
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:35,706
We split it three ways.

275
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,641
I ain't splitting shit.

276
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:42,019
You got different destinations here?
Are you two splitting up?

277
00:33:42,621 --> 00:33:45,818
That's too bad.
You make a hell of a good-looking couple.

278
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:48,256
I'm not negotiating, girls.

279
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:52,625
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

280
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,632
Fuck you. I'd rather turn us in.

281
00:33:58,703 --> 00:33:59,703
Go ahead.

282
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,190
Hi, yes, I'd like to report an emergency.

283
00:34:20,292 --> 00:34:23,193
I'm at the Plaza Hotel. Room 508.

284
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:26,130
Hang up.

285
00:34:27,032 --> 00:34:31,492
Yes, I'd like to report gross insurance fraud
and other shit that doesn't have a name.

286
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,402
No, it is an emergency.

287
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:35,328
It's life and death.

288
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,076
My name?

289
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:47,182
My name is Eva...

290
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:57,395
I'm fucking out of here!

291
00:34:58,196 --> 00:34:59,196
Go ahead.

292
00:35:38,003 --> 00:35:39,061
No!

293
00:35:51,416 --> 00:35:54,010
The women didn't check out.
They had fake IDs.

294
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:56,349
Torn-up plane tickets in different names.

295
00:36:00,592 --> 00:36:02,390
He's delirious. Lower the dosage.

296
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:07,187
How'd you do it, Sam?
How'd you survive the boat?

297
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:10,531
You never got on that boat.

298
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:12,262
You bought up the hit?

299
00:36:20,779 --> 00:36:22,269
You remember Cortez?

300
00:36:23,448 --> 00:36:25,712
Nobody forgets a bloodbath like that.

301
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:30,610
You tell me what I want to know,
or I'll handle this the way you would have...

302
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:32,851
and believe me, you don't want that.

303
00:36:33,892 --> 00:36:35,382
Where the hell am I?

304
00:36:36,061 --> 00:36:40,020
Why do you stroll into a consulate
and break a perfect cover?

305
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:41,895
The consulate.

306
00:36:44,836 --> 00:36:45,997
My passport.

307
00:36:46,504 --> 00:36:48,632
Were you trying to send a message?

308
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,565
Network still active?

309
00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:54,573
I don't know.

310
00:36:57,015 --> 00:36:59,279
Hey, Doc, you got something for amnesia?

311
00:37:07,826 --> 00:37:09,885
I don't know what you're talking about.

312
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:20,562
Get me out of this!

313
00:37:25,143 --> 00:37:26,872
Get the fuck away from me!

314
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:55,238
Was your younger brother working for you?
What's his name?

315
00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:56,705
Max, the doctor.

316
00:37:57,075 --> 00:37:59,703
All those trips
to South America in his plane.

317
00:37:59,811 --> 00:38:02,303
What was he doing? Acting as your courier?

318
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:05,550
Then Max goes and dies.
Now you got a problem.

319
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:08,814
Because he's your go-between,
your link to the old world.

320
00:38:09,354 --> 00:38:10,753
Business is on hold...

321
00:38:10,822 --> 00:38:14,952
so you go to the consulate to try and get
a message to someone who can help.

322
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:17,892
Someone from the old days. Is that it?

323
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:22,031
Give me something so I can help you, Sam.

324
00:38:24,936 --> 00:38:26,097
I'm not Sam.

325
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:29,204
I'm his brother.

326
00:38:34,012 --> 00:38:35,810
It's gonna be a long night.

327
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:37,481
No!

328
00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:57,892
Mr. Crawley's on the line.
He wants an update on the situation.

329
00:38:58,136 --> 00:39:01,197
Right, better think about talking, Sam...

330
00:39:01,706 --> 00:39:06,041
'cause if Crawley has to come down here,
he won't be as nice to you as I've been.

331
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,946
Sam, do we need the girl?

332
00:42:24,809 --> 00:42:27,369
Sam, what did they do to you?

333
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,515
Open up. Swallow.

334
00:42:33,818 --> 00:42:34,818
Swallow.

335
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:50,226
Who is she?

336
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:52,669
Met her in Belize.

337
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:55,305
Belize? That's where you've been hiding?

338
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:58,470
I don't recall.

339
00:42:59,043 --> 00:43:00,043
What?

340
00:43:00,545 --> 00:43:01,842
I don't recall.

341
00:43:01,979 --> 00:43:04,539
Sam, it's me. You can drop the damn act.

342
00:43:11,155 --> 00:43:13,419
You do remember me, right, Sam?

343
00:43:16,027 --> 00:43:17,620
You remember me, right?

344
00:43:24,202 --> 00:43:25,795
You remember me, right?

345
00:43:32,877 --> 00:43:33,877
Yes.

346
00:43:36,914 --> 00:43:39,849
Four years, I've been living like a roach.

347
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:41,908
I've been eating people's shit.

348
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,347
Show me the money, Sam.

349
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:46,446
Sam, it's my payday.

350
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:55,698
I'm gonna get you something to eat.
Get you some clothes.

351
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:58,201
Don't go outside. All our friends are dead.

352
00:44:01,939 --> 00:44:04,340
Don't worry about this,
we're gonna figure this out.

353
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:06,809
We're gonna put it back together,
piece by piece.

354
00:44:06,878 --> 00:44:08,573
Just like Humpty Dumpty.

355
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:10,409
Just like him.

356
00:44:30,701 --> 00:44:32,066
I'm out of here.

357
00:44:34,939 --> 00:44:36,668
You know what's out there?

358
00:44:45,917 --> 00:44:49,114
- Let's get the money and get out of here.
- You're going nowhere.

359
00:44:51,322 --> 00:44:52,812
Not with my money.

360
00:44:53,424 --> 00:44:55,358
No, baby, that's our money.

361
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:59,524
I worked just as hard as you for that money.
That is our money, Max.

362
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:05,563
- Get over it.
- Get over what?

363
00:45:05,636 --> 00:45:08,128
You tried to play Kye,
and she played you first.

364
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:09,674
Have you any shame?

365
00:45:10,274 --> 00:45:13,141
Or hasn't it dawned on you
those people killed Kye?

366
00:45:22,153 --> 00:45:25,646
Now you got two things left in the world.
You have him and me.

367
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:27,213
You're not going anywhere...

368
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:30,955
till I find out whatever the hell it is
my brother got himself mixed up in.

369
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:34,058
Who the fuck that is, I don't know.

370
00:45:34,298 --> 00:45:37,097
And I don't know what it is
these people want from me.

371
00:45:37,168 --> 00:45:40,365
I don't know what the hell is going on here,
but until we do...

372
00:45:40,438 --> 00:45:42,133
if he leads, we follow.

373
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:43,603
You understand?

374
00:45:55,486 --> 00:45:58,114
This is Pope. Get me Crawley on the line.

375
00:45:59,857 --> 00:46:03,623
- You're gonna play some tennis today?
- Yeah, the weather looks good.

376
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:06,860
- And you, boys?
- Maybe later. After swimming.

377
00:46:09,667 --> 00:46:11,066
Yeah, this is Crawley.

378
00:46:11,135 --> 00:46:13,399
I'm afraid I got some bad news, Mr. Crawley.

379
00:46:13,571 --> 00:46:14,571
Hold on.

380
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:18,837
What happened?

381
00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:20,638
Sam got away. He had help.

382
00:46:21,579 --> 00:46:23,946
It has to be someone from the old days.

383
00:46:24,181 --> 00:46:26,411
This is not how I planned my retirement.

384
00:46:26,684 --> 00:46:29,153
You've got to find them
before they disappear again.

385
00:46:29,387 --> 00:46:32,982
The information they have
could destroy us all. Do you understand?

386
00:46:33,658 --> 00:46:34,658
Very well.

387
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:52,170
How you doing, sir?

388
00:46:52,243 --> 00:46:54,644
I think you'll find that
to your satisfaction.

389
00:46:54,712 --> 00:46:57,044
How're we doing today? You okay?

390
00:46:57,982 --> 00:46:59,541
Good. You all right?

391
00:47:03,788 --> 00:47:05,347
Good, that's it.

392
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:09,251
What do you think, bro?
Move down here, do some good?

393
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,025
Time to wake up.

394
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,165
Brought you a shirt and a jacket here.

395
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:21,765
- I'm all right.
- Come on, try it on.

396
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:24,408
Come on, put it on.

397
00:48:02,012 --> 00:48:04,140
Where the hell have you been, man?

398
00:48:05,816 --> 00:48:07,545
Man, it's good to see you.

399
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:09,319
This is for you.

400
00:48:11,689 --> 00:48:13,054
Come on, take it.

401
00:48:18,062 --> 00:48:19,496
Okay, { remember.

402
00:48:22,333 --> 00:48:24,324
I remember I was attached...

403
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:27,034
to UNICEF as an attaché.

404
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:32,469
Yeah, that was your specialty,
hiding in plain sight.

405
00:48:32,676 --> 00:48:34,576
Damn, that was a beautiful cover.

406
00:48:36,447 --> 00:48:37,846
What do you mean, "cover"?

407
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:40,976
To train and supply the rebels
in Central America.

408
00:48:41,285 --> 00:48:42,912
Sam, you were D.C.0O.

409
00:48:43,354 --> 00:48:45,379
Deep Cover Operative, CIA.

410
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:49,683
Man, what you lost in here
can bring down some high people.

411
00:48:51,362 --> 00:48:52,955
What's your real name?

412
00:48:53,564 --> 00:48:54,690
John Wolfe.

413
00:49:04,542 --> 00:49:06,533
What happened to my exchange program?

414
00:49:07,044 --> 00:49:09,069
The program I developed for those kids?

415
00:49:11,048 --> 00:49:13,278
Sam, we were using them kids as mules.

416
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:15,580
I think you'll find that
to your satisfaction.

417
00:49:15,653 --> 00:49:17,519
How're we doing today? Good?

418
00:49:17,688 --> 00:49:19,417
You all good? Good.

419
00:49:21,025 --> 00:49:23,824
You built your own little network
inside the CIA.

420
00:49:24,128 --> 00:49:27,063
It was a fantastic operation.
It was all profit. No overhead.

421
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:31,125
We were moving coca for the Colombians
using the CIA resources.

422
00:49:32,102 --> 00:49:33,467
It was fantastic.

423
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:39,341
Then a cease-and-desist order
came from upstairs.

424
00:49:40,845 --> 00:49:42,677
You blackmailed the company.

425
00:49:46,016 --> 00:49:47,882
That was the beginning of the end.

426
00:49:48,919 --> 00:49:50,648
They got everyone but me.

427
00:49:51,622 --> 00:49:52,622
And you.

428
00:49:55,192 --> 00:49:56,216
The last thing you did...

429
00:49:56,293 --> 00:49:58,762
before getting on that boat
was hide the money.

430
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:00,126
Our money, Sam.

431
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:03,463
- Where's the money?
- We'll find it.

432
00:50:03,534 --> 00:50:05,468
How much is there?
How many zeroes are there?

433
00:50:05,536 --> 00:50:06,901
About $3 million.

434
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:10,797
$3 million? Sam, we had $250 million.

435
00:50:11,075 --> 00:50:13,874
We had a quarter billion.
Where's the money?

436
00:50:17,882 --> 00:50:19,577
All right, it's a start.

437
00:50:21,552 --> 00:50:24,749
- Where are we going to find it?
- We'll go to San Diego.

438
00:50:25,823 --> 00:50:27,188
It's in the bank.

439
00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:45,638
Who the hell is this Crawley character?

440
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,905
- You don't remember Crawley?
- No.

441
00:50:48,145 --> 00:50:49,635
They mentioned him.

442
00:50:50,514 --> 00:50:52,482
He was the big boy at the CIA.

443
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:54,614
He's enemy number one, man.

444
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:56,683
He's the one who made you.

445
00:50:59,256 --> 00:51:02,453
They mentioned something about
some place called Cortez.

446
00:51:05,262 --> 00:51:08,163
Some things about you
that are better off forgotten.

447
00:51:08,566 --> 00:51:11,263
What the hell?
I might as well know everything.

448
00:51:13,537 --> 00:51:16,131
They cleared an airfield near this village.

449
00:51:16,206 --> 00:51:18,641
We'd land our 727s out of Cali there.

450
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:20,778
It was going great...

451
00:51:21,111 --> 00:51:23,239
till the federales seized the shipment.

452
00:51:25,482 --> 00:51:28,315
You get the snitch,
and killed everyone involved.

453
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:31,354
Then you went after their families.

454
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:33,356
Young, old...

455
00:51:35,225 --> 00:51:36,488
didn't matter.

456
00:51:37,661 --> 00:51:39,493
Just left them rotting in the sun.

457
00:51:40,197 --> 00:51:42,723
The only ones who were happy
were the dogs.

458
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:48,862
Do you remember this man?

459
00:51:50,374 --> 00:51:52,672
Yeah, he came in a couple of days ago.

460
00:51:52,743 --> 00:51:55,735
He was asking me some questions
about one of our clients.

461
00:51:55,813 --> 00:51:56,813
I see.

462
00:51:57,381 --> 00:51:59,179
Couple of days ago, you said?

463
00:52:02,653 --> 00:52:05,748
Can't even really listen to what he says,
you know?

464
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,751
Doesn't even make any sense.

465
00:52:13,263 --> 00:52:16,927
Remember, it was your brother
who did those things, not you.

466
00:52:18,002 --> 00:52:19,731
About tomorrow...

467
00:52:21,472 --> 00:52:24,601
I still have a friend at the bank, Susan.
Maybe she can help us.

468
00:52:25,743 --> 00:52:29,179
We're still gonna need about an hour
together, alone in there.

469
00:52:31,949 --> 00:52:33,246
Why haven't...

470
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:39,954
We can take care of our problem,
right here and now.

471
00:52:41,892 --> 00:52:44,327
He's gonna kill us, sooner or later.

472
00:52:47,097 --> 00:52:48,394
Self-defense.

473
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:50,428
I'm a doctor.

474
00:53:08,919 --> 00:53:11,320
Hey, kids, look what daddy brought home.

475
00:53:13,223 --> 00:53:17,091
So I'm thinking about tomorrow and...
Are there any side exits to that bank?

476
00:53:17,161 --> 00:53:18,959
- No.
- What about the cameras?

477
00:53:19,596 --> 00:53:21,223
Pretty much everywhere.

478
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:26,498
I think I'm gonna wait on the street then,
with the artillery.

479
00:53:27,438 --> 00:53:29,930
So how much money
are we gonna get in cash?

480
00:53:30,908 --> 00:53:33,104
Depends on how much is in the reserve.

481
00:53:33,177 --> 00:53:36,613
Probably no more than $200,000 or $300,000.

482
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:39,347
So it's a one-stop shop.

483
00:53:39,416 --> 00:53:43,148
So we're gonna have to transfer the balance
to my little account.

484
00:53:50,594 --> 00:53:52,961
So, you know,
this $3 million we're picking up...

485
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:54,964
it's part of our little contingency funds.

486
00:53:55,032 --> 00:53:57,023
We had a few of them laying around.

487
00:53:57,101 --> 00:53:59,934
But the big money, I mean,
the really big money...

488
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:02,270
is locked away in Sam's head.

489
00:54:03,173 --> 00:54:05,699
If you want, you know,
we can head down south...

490
00:54:05,776 --> 00:54:07,505
and visit some of the old neighborhood.

491
00:54:07,578 --> 00:54:09,672
See if we can't wake his memory up.

492
00:54:10,647 --> 00:54:12,843
And he trusts you. That's important.

493
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:14,384
Imagine that payoff.

494
00:54:14,651 --> 00:54:15,777
I'm trying.

495
00:54:15,853 --> 00:54:18,515
$3 million buys you a little time.

496
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:21,885
$200 million plus...

497
00:54:23,393 --> 00:54:24,622
now, that's freedom.

498
00:54:35,706 --> 00:54:37,037
I'm a bad drunk.

499
00:54:38,041 --> 00:54:39,372
Soam.

500
00:54:40,177 --> 00:54:43,203
You know, you can tell a lot about a man
by his hands.

501
00:54:43,547 --> 00:54:44,810
Is that right?

502
00:54:45,349 --> 00:54:47,784
Strong, shrewd...

503
00:54:48,986 --> 00:54:50,078
capable...

504
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:54,949
unafraid...

505
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:57,218
lonely...

506
00:55:07,938 --> 00:55:09,565
I'm not your plaything.

507
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:14,910
I told you, I was a bad drunk.

508
00:55:50,514 --> 00:55:52,642
You got the account number, right?

509
00:55:54,117 --> 00:55:57,644
Sam, in and out real quick, right?
Just like old times.

510
00:55:58,889 --> 00:56:01,551
Pretty, listen,
I'm gonna be on the phone with my bankers.

511
00:56:01,625 --> 00:56:02,751
Look smart.

512
00:56:03,427 --> 00:56:04,427
Have fun.

513
00:56:11,668 --> 00:56:13,136
So, what's the plan?

514
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:15,501
Just stay out of my way,
and let me do the talking.

515
00:56:15,572 --> 00:56:19,406
We'll be out of here with the money
before that asshole realizes what happened.

516
00:56:37,895 --> 00:56:39,363
What brings you in?

517
00:56:40,564 --> 00:56:43,727
Remember when I had you
transfer that money to the Caymans?

518
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,360
I need you to reverse it,
and I need to cash it out.

519
00:56:46,436 --> 00:56:48,530
No way there's that much in reserve.

520
00:56:48,605 --> 00:56:50,937
You get us out of here within an hour...

521
00:56:51,008 --> 00:56:52,442
you got $10,000.

522
00:56:53,343 --> 00:56:54,343
Shit.

523
00:57:01,184 --> 00:57:03,710
I'll try.
I need a moneytransfer request.

524
00:57:04,121 --> 00:57:08,615
You have reached the Zurich National Bank.
Please hold for the next available agent.

525
00:57:28,879 --> 00:57:31,871
Hold. Ja, there is a transfer request now.

526
00:57:31,949 --> 00:57:33,610
I'll hold till it goes through.

527
00:57:33,684 --> 00:57:34,742
Yes.

528
00:57:59,776 --> 00:58:02,302
What the hell are you doing?
You see what time it is?

529
00:58:02,379 --> 00:58:03,744
- I know.
- It's been over an hour.

530
00:58:03,814 --> 00:58:05,942
- It'll be here soon.
- He's gonna pick us up now.

531
00:58:19,229 --> 00:58:21,789
- You look familiar.
- Yeah, I get that a lot.

532
00:58:23,834 --> 00:58:25,632
The money's here. Let's go.

533
00:58:26,269 --> 00:58:29,034
Hi, this is Wendy Hall at New Union Bank.

534
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:31,073
I was told to call this number...

535
00:58:31,141 --> 00:58:34,202
if I had any information
on the man who showed up here.

536
00:58:34,878 --> 00:58:38,746
The transfer is coming now
in the amount of $1.

537
00:58:39,016 --> 00:58:41,849
This is right, $1 U.S., Mr. Deere?

538
00:58:46,723 --> 00:58:48,555
Are you there, Mr. Deere?

539
00:59:29,966 --> 00:59:31,400
I don't know what you're playing.

540
00:59:31,468 --> 00:59:32,902
We got friends.

541
01:00:01,665 --> 01:00:02,962
- Where're you going?
- Come on.

542
01:00:03,033 --> 01:00:06,663
- You told Wolfe that was the only access.
- Why don't you just trust me?

543
01:00:09,206 --> 01:00:11,334
Shit, we gotta go out the front.

544
01:00:20,851 --> 01:00:21,851
There.

545
01:00:35,866 --> 01:00:37,493
Move! Get out of the way!

546
01:01:29,553 --> 01:01:30,918
Going somewhere?

547
01:01:49,506 --> 01:01:50,735
- Now!
- Get down!

548
01:01:52,342 --> 01:01:53,342
What the fuck?

549
01:05:25,655 --> 01:05:26,747
We got him now.

550
01:06:21,911 --> 01:06:23,174
That's all, folks!

551
01:06:30,119 --> 01:06:31,314
Yes, Mr. Crawley.

552
01:06:31,921 --> 01:06:34,788
So what was that mess
at the bank this afternoon?

553
01:06:34,858 --> 01:06:39,091
I wasn't there, but I've got every available
agent down there looking for him.

554
01:06:39,262 --> 01:06:41,697
In other words, it's back to square one.

555
01:06:41,764 --> 01:06:44,597
Reed came across something,
I'm checking into it now.

556
01:06:44,767 --> 01:06:46,030
A couple of months ago...

557
01:06:46,102 --> 01:06:48,764
someone requested
Sam Tyler's dental records.

558
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:50,863
I don't want play-by-play.

559
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:52,599
I want results.

560
01:06:56,145 --> 01:06:57,145
Prick.

561
01:07:03,887 --> 01:07:06,413
Why did this coroner's office...

562
01:07:06,489 --> 01:07:10,892
request Sam Tyler's dental records
from 19792.

563
01:07:13,897 --> 01:07:15,365
I don't know.

564
01:07:19,168 --> 01:07:21,159
Come on, get to work!

565
01:07:22,238 --> 01:07:25,208
Sam, you'd never double-cross me, right?

566
01:07:25,575 --> 01:07:27,907
No way in hell you'd double-cross me.

567
01:07:27,977 --> 01:07:30,344
Not after all we've been through, right?

568
01:07:30,446 --> 01:07:32,414
Sam, I'm talking to you.

569
01:07:33,917 --> 01:07:35,112
Get down. Run.

570
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:37,011
Run!

571
01:08:16,593 --> 01:08:18,618
You don't wanna miss this.

572
01:08:24,434 --> 01:08:25,765
Losers.

573
01:08:26,369 --> 01:08:29,771
Partner, cheated death,
like the old days, right?

574
01:08:44,387 --> 01:08:47,220
We're partners, Sam?

575
01:08:48,625 --> 01:08:50,753
You remember, we're partners?

576
01:08:55,398 --> 01:08:56,991
Damn, that feels good.

577
01:09:25,728 --> 01:09:27,628
Double-crossing bastard, Sam.

578
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:33,868
After all we've been through,
you're gonna double-cross me?

579
01:09:33,936 --> 01:09:36,598
Today's a good day to die, Sam.

580
01:09:37,674 --> 01:09:38,937
Sam is dead.

581
01:09:41,310 --> 01:09:43,142
- What?
- Sam is dead.

582
01:09:44,814 --> 01:09:46,908
That's right, Sam is dead.

583
01:09:47,050 --> 01:09:49,747
Ease up, he's telling you the truth.

584
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:52,621
I'm his brother.

585
01:09:54,457 --> 01:09:56,482
Stop it, it's the truth!

586
01:09:57,927 --> 01:09:59,417
I'm a surgeon.

587
01:10:00,396 --> 01:10:04,060
I live in San Diego.

588
01:10:04,133 --> 01:10:06,693
You ever fucking heard of plastic surgery?

589
01:10:06,936 --> 01:10:08,904
Look at him, look at the scars!

590
01:10:09,972 --> 01:10:12,703
- Whose money is in the bag, then?
- It's my settlement.

591
01:10:13,376 --> 01:10:15,572
What settlement?

592
01:10:15,712 --> 01:10:17,180
My insurance.

593
01:10:25,421 --> 01:10:26,911
You're the dentist?

594
01:10:28,124 --> 01:10:30,957
No way! You're the dentist from San Diego?

595
01:10:34,263 --> 01:10:37,756
Sam, man, he always talked about you.
He said you were the smart one.

596
01:10:38,101 --> 01:10:40,433
You wanted to start a new life as Sam Tyler?

597
01:10:40,503 --> 01:10:42,130
You're so stupid.

598
01:10:43,339 --> 01:10:45,671
Damn, I hate dentists.

599
01:10:50,313 --> 01:10:51,610
Stop it!

600
01:10:53,649 --> 01:10:55,640
He's worth more to us alive.

601
01:11:01,724 --> 01:11:04,250
Welcome back to the land of the living, man.

602
01:11:04,327 --> 01:11:06,523
You're my new tradable commodity, brother.

603
01:11:06,596 --> 01:11:09,088
You've been reincarnated now.
You're my cow.

604
01:11:09,165 --> 01:11:10,758
Leave him alone.

605
01:11:12,869 --> 01:11:14,359
Forget about him.

606
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:17,605
- I knew you had your eyes on me.
- You got me good.

607
01:11:25,848 --> 01:11:27,942
You're a cold-hearted bitch.

608
01:11:28,818 --> 01:11:30,183
I like that.

609
01:11:31,721 --> 01:11:34,520
- That's it.
- We're gonna have a good time.

610
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:46,533
You got me.

611
01:11:47,270 --> 01:11:48,567
Come on, shoot.

612
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:52,269
Pussy.

613
01:11:54,544 --> 01:11:56,569
You can't shoot, can you?

614
01:11:59,582 --> 01:12:01,778
Max Tyler, right? Big killer.

615
01:12:03,286 --> 01:12:05,846
You really think I was gonna give you
a loaded gun?

616
01:12:05,922 --> 01:12:08,050
You think I'm that stupid?

617
01:12:10,827 --> 01:12:13,660
You really think I gave you a loaded gun?

618
01:13:53,296 --> 01:13:54,661
What is it?

619
01:13:56,532 --> 01:13:57,590
Nothing.

620
01:14:00,836 --> 01:14:03,362
Just wanna hang around bodegas somehow.

621
01:14:04,774 --> 01:14:06,435
Keep it together.

622
01:14:06,742 --> 01:14:08,836
In an hour,
we're gonna be across the border.

623
01:14:08,911 --> 01:14:12,040
We're gonna keep heading south
on that bus, just like we planned.

624
01:14:13,549 --> 01:14:15,313
We're gonna make it.

625
01:14:21,791 --> 01:14:23,088
Come on.

626
01:14:26,062 --> 01:14:27,655
Let's get out of here.

627
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:29,393
This way.

628
01:14:40,509 --> 01:14:41,943
Buenas noches, ma'am.

629
01:14:42,044 --> 01:14:44,138
- Two cups of coffee.
- Thank you, ma'am.

630
01:15:12,241 --> 01:15:13,970
Enjoying the show?

631
01:15:14,477 --> 01:15:17,503
I'd probably enjoy it a lot more
if I could trust you.

632
01:15:18,381 --> 01:15:20,372
Max, what we had was...

633
01:15:23,019 --> 01:15:24,646
What did we have?

634
01:15:25,421 --> 01:15:27,321
For the most part, it was real.

635
01:15:28,124 --> 01:15:29,523
It still is.

636
01:15:33,763 --> 01:15:35,629
As long as I'm holding cash.

637
01:15:36,699 --> 01:15:40,192
You tell me that it never crossed
your mind to take the money and split.

638
01:15:40,269 --> 01:15:42,169
You tell me that.

639
01:15:42,571 --> 01:15:43,697
Never.

640
01:15:58,521 --> 01:16:00,819
Everything we've been through...

641
01:16:02,491 --> 01:16:03,754
Come on.

642
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:06,524
Look how far we've come.

643
01:16:09,331 --> 01:16:10,662
This is me.

644
01:16:13,202 --> 01:16:15,227
I don't know who you are.

645
01:16:18,707 --> 01:16:20,641
Right here, this is me.

646
01:16:52,007 --> 01:16:54,374
Come on, baby, it's right there.

647
01:16:56,579 --> 01:16:58,240
I can't do this.

648
01:16:58,981 --> 01:17:00,676
- I'm not doing it.
- What?

649
01:17:00,749 --> 01:17:02,740
I'm not running no more.

650
01:17:03,185 --> 01:17:06,155
- Running is better than dying.
- Fuck it, we'll cut a deal.

651
01:17:06,222 --> 01:17:07,280
Cut a deal?

652
01:17:07,356 --> 01:17:09,188
I can't cut a deal at this point.

653
01:17:09,258 --> 01:17:12,057
We've got information
for Christ's sake. Let's use it.

654
01:17:12,128 --> 01:17:14,620
Exposure is what they're afraid of.

655
01:17:14,697 --> 01:17:17,632
If Crawley wants to negotiate,
fuck it, let's talk!

656
01:17:18,968 --> 01:17:20,595
I can't do that.

657
01:17:20,669 --> 01:17:22,763
What the hell have you got to lose?

658
01:17:22,838 --> 01:17:25,068
Just come with me on the bus.

659
01:17:26,442 --> 01:17:28,376
Please, just you and me.

660
01:17:29,979 --> 01:17:34,610
This is what we've been waiting for,
a chance to just get the money and go.

661
01:17:35,951 --> 01:17:37,146
Come on.

662
01:17:38,754 --> 01:17:39,915
Okay, here.

663
01:17:41,857 --> 01:17:43,256
You take it.

664
01:17:44,226 --> 01:17:45,557
You keep it.

665
01:17:48,931 --> 01:17:50,330
You keep it.

666
01:17:56,372 --> 01:17:57,737
I'm sorry.

667
01:17:58,240 --> 01:17:59,503
You just be careful.

668
01:17:59,575 --> 01:18:02,272
- I'm sorry for everything.
- Yeah, I know.

669
01:18:03,412 --> 01:18:05,574
- You be careful.
- Yeah, okay.

670
01:18:12,421 --> 01:18:13,911
Just keep walking.

671
01:18:20,329 --> 01:18:23,424
There's a hotel in Guadalajara.

672
01:18:23,666 --> 01:18:24,997
La Pacifica.

673
01:18:25,801 --> 01:18:27,826
I'll be there for a week.

674
01:18:28,804 --> 01:18:29,965
Like last time.

675
01:18:43,919 --> 01:18:45,011
Wait!

676
01:19:15,851 --> 01:19:19,253
{ left a package for you in
a convenience-store bathroom down here...

677
01:19:19,321 --> 01:19:21,517
and you're gonna know where
in about three days.

678
01:19:21,790 --> 01:19:24,487
How do I know
this isn't some kind of bullshit?

679
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:27,461
"This isn't exactly your old BUW, Mr. Tyler."

680
01:19:28,664 --> 01:19:30,393
Do you remember telling me that?

681
01:19:30,466 --> 01:19:31,627
Max?

682
01:19:32,434 --> 01:19:33,833
Max Tyler?

683
01:19:34,603 --> 01:19:36,367
Hello? Shit.

684
01:19:37,573 --> 01:19:40,099
Judy, can you trace a call for me?

685
01:19:41,710 --> 01:19:43,269
And your name?

686
01:19:43,812 --> 01:19:46,838
Same as it was the last time
I was transferred, honey.

687
01:19:47,149 --> 01:19:48,310
You tell Mr. Crawley...

688
01:19:48,384 --> 01:19:50,682
his former associate, Mr. Sam Tyler,
is on the phone.

689
01:19:50,753 --> 01:19:52,482
Maybe he could avail himself here.

690
01:19:52,554 --> 01:19:54,386
- Just a moment.
- Thank you.

691
01:20:06,268 --> 01:20:07,736
Dr. Max Tyler.

692
01:20:09,104 --> 01:20:11,596
I hope you had a lot of fun
playing your brother.

693
01:20:11,674 --> 01:20:13,233
You're in a lot of trouble.

694
01:20:13,309 --> 01:20:15,710
How would you like me
to respond to that, sir?

695
01:20:16,378 --> 01:20:19,177
I'd like for us to meet,
maybe straighten things out.

696
01:20:19,248 --> 01:20:21,717
Are you gonna bring your household tools?

697
01:20:21,784 --> 01:20:23,843
No need for that now.

698
01:20:24,119 --> 01:20:26,554
Is the man who broke you out
of the factory with you?

699
01:20:26,622 --> 01:20:28,647
Are you referring to John Wolfe?

700
01:20:29,425 --> 01:20:31,917
Yes, I'm referring to John Wolfe.

701
01:20:33,095 --> 01:20:34,927
He's not with me right now.

702
01:20:38,067 --> 01:20:41,469
I assume you'd want something in return
for his whereabouts.

703
01:20:42,738 --> 01:20:44,263
Yes, I would.

704
01:20:44,473 --> 01:20:47,932
I would like a new and a functional identity.

705
01:20:49,211 --> 01:20:50,474
Is that clear?

706
01:20:52,014 --> 01:20:53,743
Where is the woman?

707
01:20:54,416 --> 01:20:56,680
I've got enough evidence
on "Tropic of Cancer"...

708
01:20:56,752 --> 01:20:59,050
for Congress to cancel their lunch break.

709
01:20:59,121 --> 01:21:01,215
Is this beginning to make sense now?

710
01:21:01,290 --> 01:21:04,316
Nobody has that much knowledge,
then there's the burden of proof.

711
01:21:04,393 --> 01:21:07,795
I'd say it's enough to be accused
these days, wouldn't you?

712
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:10,389
Where are you, Max?

713
01:21:10,466 --> 01:21:11,490
What?

714
01:21:11,734 --> 01:21:13,566
Can I call you Max?

715
01:21:16,572 --> 01:21:17,971
You there?

716
01:21:20,542 --> 01:21:22,135
Are you there, Max?

717
01:21:28,217 --> 01:21:30,015
Max, are you there?

718
01:21:34,623 --> 01:21:36,318
I'll tell you what.

719
01:21:36,392 --> 01:21:38,417
Everything I've got here is on paper.

720
01:21:38,494 --> 01:21:40,963
In about three days,
I'm gonna toss it to the vultures.

721
01:21:41,029 --> 01:21:43,930
You're gonna be on every laptop
from San Diego to Sri Lanka.

722
01:21:43,999 --> 01:21:47,299
You want me to give you
a toll-free number to Career Blazers?

723
01:21:47,870 --> 01:21:50,840
There is no need for that.
Where do I send a car?

724
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:53,500
You know a little border town
called El Centro?

725
01:21:53,876 --> 01:21:55,844
- It's the old diner off the 8.
- Okay.

726
01:22:54,570 --> 01:22:56,402
Why're we coming all the way out here?

727
01:22:56,472 --> 01:22:58,372
Less to worry about.

728
01:22:59,842 --> 01:23:02,436
Sorry about the Frankenstein routine.

729
01:23:02,511 --> 01:23:03,979
No hard feelings?

730
01:23:27,336 --> 01:23:28,963
Crawley is this way.

731
01:24:08,310 --> 01:24:09,641
Wait here.

732
01:24:09,912 --> 01:24:11,971
Pope, he wants to see you alone.

733
01:24:21,156 --> 01:24:22,749
So where's Crawley?

734
01:24:37,773 --> 01:24:39,764
Rough night we're having.

735
01:24:42,010 --> 01:24:43,944
So where are Agent Jones and Philips?

736
01:24:44,012 --> 01:24:45,639
Where the fuck are they?

737
01:24:45,714 --> 01:24:47,876
Boss is gonna be pissed if...

738
01:25:16,478 --> 01:25:17,673
Crawley?

739
01:25:18,513 --> 01:25:20,277
No, Crawley's dead.

740
01:25:20,916 --> 01:25:22,884
It's just you and me now, Max.

741
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:25,780
Look at you.

742
01:25:27,422 --> 01:25:28,890
Jesus Christ.

743
01:25:40,402 --> 01:25:41,836
Look at you.

744
01:25:47,009 --> 01:25:48,977
What did they do to you?

745
01:25:53,682 --> 01:25:55,673
Mommy and Daddy are dead.

746
01:25:57,019 --> 01:25:58,783
I know. I was there.

747
01:26:00,122 --> 01:26:02,181
Do you know how much
they believed in you?

748
01:26:02,257 --> 01:26:03,725
You think so?

749
01:26:05,627 --> 01:26:08,028
I think I was a walking time bomb.

750
01:26:08,897 --> 01:26:13,198
- You're just about every belief they had.
- Do you know how much we looked for you?

751
01:26:14,369 --> 01:26:16,463
What did you come down here for?

752
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:21,337
Why you got these spooks
digging up my bones?

753
01:26:22,144 --> 01:26:24,010
You doing me a favor?

754
01:26:25,414 --> 01:26:28,111
You flush out Crawley,
I got to settle all my debts.

755
01:26:29,818 --> 01:26:32,515
I could never say
we're cut from the same cloth.

756
01:26:33,488 --> 01:26:36,480
Shit, we're both sitting here now, ain't we?

757
01:26:44,199 --> 01:26:47,328
If you recall me as a boy, brother,
I was a believer.

758
01:26:47,402 --> 01:26:48,528
You were there.

759
01:26:48,603 --> 01:26:51,698
I was champion to these tribes
down here once, wasn't 1?

760
01:26:52,307 --> 01:26:55,834
I was champion to the indigenous people
of South Vietnam.

761
01:26:57,546 --> 01:26:59,310
I was into civil rights.

762
01:27:00,382 --> 01:27:02,976
You were nothing
but a dope-smoking bigot...

763
01:27:03,719 --> 01:27:05,016
if you recall.

764
01:27:05,954 --> 01:27:07,820
Yeah, I was a kid once, too.

765
01:27:08,390 --> 01:27:10,518
I was a kid when I got out of that war.

766
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:12,822
You know what I had on my back?
My uniform.

767
01:27:13,228 --> 01:27:16,994
You know what I did with that uniform?
I wore it. You know why?

768
01:27:20,035 --> 01:27:22,003
Because it's all I had.

769
01:27:23,538 --> 01:27:24,630
So you're right.

770
01:27:24,706 --> 01:27:27,198
You don't ever say
we're cut from the same cloth.

771
01:27:30,645 --> 01:27:32,306
You choose to love a queen...

772
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:35,782
and she turns out to be a whore,
you just make adjustments.

773
01:27:37,586 --> 01:27:39,611
By the way, your girl's up top.

774
01:27:40,088 --> 01:27:41,852
I'm pressed for time now.

775
01:27:41,923 --> 01:27:43,618
Catch that dinghy.

776
01:27:43,759 --> 01:27:45,352
Don't look back.

777
01:27:49,364 --> 01:27:50,832
You're a fanatic.

778
01:27:51,099 --> 01:27:52,328
Fanatic?

779
01:27:53,735 --> 01:27:57,763
Fanatics run this world, brother.
I've got nothing to do with that.

780
01:28:00,342 --> 01:28:02,470
I hope one day God understands you, Sam.

781
01:28:03,345 --> 01:28:06,440
- Understands me?
- You took the lives of innocents.

782
01:28:06,681 --> 01:28:08,046
Innocents?

783
01:28:08,383 --> 01:28:10,351
"Innocence" is a matter of semantics.

784
01:28:11,319 --> 01:28:15,085
Every day, some 15-year-old boy
in some far away land does what I did.

785
01:28:16,324 --> 01:28:18,053
You understand him.

786
01:28:21,229 --> 01:28:24,062
Next time you choose a new life,
make one up.

787
01:28:24,566 --> 01:28:25,931
It's safer.

788
01:28:58,200 --> 01:29:00,669
We had a quarter billion.
Where's the money?

789
01:29:00,735 --> 01:29:02,100
We split it three ways.

790
01:29:02,637 --> 01:29:04,196
Look at yourself. Look at your face.

791
01:29:04,272 --> 01:29:08,038
Writing a book about Ashley Commerford.
You could still be the final chapter.

792
01:29:08,109 --> 01:29:09,133
Straighten things out.

793
01:29:09,211 --> 01:29:11,646
Why wouldn't you want to tell
your side of the story?

794
01:29:11,713 --> 01:29:14,341
I hope you had a lot of fun
playing your brother.

795
01:30:59,487 --> 01:31:01,512
Wait! The money!

796
01:31:40,495 --> 01:31:41,758
Eva!

797
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:13,259
Purgatory.

798
01:32:15,030 --> 01:32:17,226
That's what { call this place.

799
01:32:21,770 --> 01:32:23,738
I don't travel much now.

800
01:32:30,545 --> 01:32:33,139
{ think I understand now
what money was to Eva.

801
01:32:34,382 --> 01:32:36,476
It's not the glitter it buys.

802
01:32:36,751 --> 01:32:38,480
It's the security.

803
01:32:42,323 --> 01:32:45,088
The most valuable thing we own
is our good name.

804
01:32:45,627 --> 01:32:47,288
Our reputation.

805
01:32:48,530 --> 01:32:50,931
That's the only part of
us that lives forever.
