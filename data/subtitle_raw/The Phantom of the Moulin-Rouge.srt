00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,947
<i>Stéphane and I have known each other for years.</i>

2
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:13,025
<i>We were neighbours.</i>

3
00:00:15,611 --> 00:00:19,939
<i>One day, a guy pissed on the low wall
that separated our two houses.</i>

4
00:00:22,254 --> 00:00:23,934
<i>His parents accused me.</i>

5
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:26,191
<i>And mine accused Stéphane.</i>

6
00:00:27,153 --> 00:00:28,723
<i>That's how we met.</i>

7
00:00:28,986 --> 00:00:30,970
<i>In between two yelling sets of parents.</i>

8
00:00:32,096 --> 00:00:33,665
<font color="#ffff00">THE MOULIN ROUGE</font>

9
00:00:41,864 --> 00:00:42,984
Yeah, go!

10
00:00:44,121 --> 00:00:45,814
- I'm getting ready to fire!
- Yeah! go ahead, go on!

11
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:49,944
- Hey, are you okay?

12
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:52,768
Wait, wait!
- No, the old woman.

13
00:00:52,792 --> 00:00:54,127
The old woman, go on!

14
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,192
What are you doing there?

15
00:00:59,162 --> 00:01:00,599
You clowns, are you mad?

16
00:01:00,677 --> 00:01:02,677
Why are you throwing rocks at people?

17
00:01:04,535 --> 00:01:06,440
<i>They had a very small apartment.</i>

18
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:11,929
<i>My parents couldn't understand how eight
people could live in there, jammed together.</i>

19
00:01:12,467 --> 00:01:14,592
<i>They thought the apartment
would collapse one day.</i>

20
00:01:14,617 --> 00:01:15,749
<i>And that they'd deserve it.</i>

21
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,201
<i>They couldn't stand all the noise,
the—effervescence.</i>

22
00:01:22,361 --> 00:01:24,438
<i>There were always unbelievable
scenes in Stéphane’s house.</i>

23
00:01:28,703 --> 00:01:32,238
<i>One day, his little sister nearly jumped
out the window because of her boyfriend.</i>

24
00:01:33,067 --> 00:01:34,699
<i>It woke up the whole neighborhood.</i>

25
00:01:38,317 --> 00:01:39,738
<i>I enjoyed going to Stéphane's.</i>

26
00:01:43,725 --> 00:01:45,217
<i>It changed me a bit.</i>

27
00:01:53,143 --> 00:01:54,143
<i>At home—</i>

28
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:55,921
<i>No one had any passion.</i>

29
00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:01,573
<i>My father spent his time reading his newspapers.</i>

30
00:02:02,024 --> 00:02:03,500
<i>And my mother listened to the radio.</i>

31
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:06,726
<i>Sometimes I tried to stimulate them a bit.</i>

32
00:02:06,828 --> 00:02:08,528
<i>To talk to them, to make them react.</i>

33
00:02:09,206 --> 00:02:10,620
<i>To be a little cheeky.</i>

34
00:02:12,112 --> 00:02:14,337
<i>Well, I quickly stopped that
because I got slapped.</i>

35
00:02:15,831 --> 00:02:18,966
<i>I know Stéphane's uncle said that
my mother had a broom up her arse.</i>

36
00:02:21,686 --> 00:02:23,045
<i>I think he had a point.</i>

37
00:02:25,701 --> 00:02:28,115
<i>Stéphane and I have always gone to the same school.</i>

38
00:02:29,595 --> 00:02:32,347
<i>I remember one day, Stéphane wasn't
paying attention in the French lesson.</i>

39
00:02:32,368 --> 00:02:34,556
<i>The teacher pointed at the door,
and told him to take it and leave,</i>

40
00:02:35,696 --> 00:02:37,656
<i>He really took the door—And he left.</i>

41
00:02:39,946 --> 00:02:41,711
<i>It took them two weeks to find it.</i>

42
00:02:41,915 --> 00:02:43,156
<i>We'd hidden it at my house.</i>

43
00:02:45,347 --> 00:02:47,463
<i>The neighbourhood held no secrets for us.</i>

44
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:50,276
<i>We knew all the gossip.</i>

45
00:02:52,651 --> 00:02:54,918
<i>So sometimes we made use of it.</i>

46
00:02:55,607 --> 00:02:57,583
<i>When the tobacconist wouldn't sell us cigarettes,</i>

47
00:02:57,607 --> 00:02:59,982
<i>we threatened him we'd tell everyone
about his affair with the florist.</i>

48
00:03:03,623 --> 00:03:05,380
<i>But that didn't work all the time.</i>

49
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:07,998
Go on, run, run!

50
00:03:17,133 --> 00:03:20,224
<i>Stéphane was a big fan of cabarets.
Especially the Moulin Rouge.</i>

51
00:03:21,378 --> 00:03:22,550
<i>He felt it was special.</i>

52
00:03:23,198 --> 00:03:26,081
<i>Apart from the dancing girls,
I didn't really see the point.</i>

53
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,398
<i>But all that luxury, that glitter—</i>

54
00:03:28,964 --> 00:03:30,084
<i>It intoxicated him.</i>

55
00:04:01,398 --> 00:04:02,398
<i>One evening,</i>

56
00:04:03,429 --> 00:04:06,718
<i>Stéphane found out he'd have to move
with his family to eastern France.</i>

57
00:04:11,713 --> 00:04:15,135
<i>His father had found a job and of course
he was going to have to help him.</i>

58
00:04:19,096 --> 00:04:20,435
<i>When he told me the news—</i>

59
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,416
<i>we didn't talk much.</i>

60
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:28,087
<i>But I knew it was coming soon.</i>

61
00:04:32,974 --> 00:04:34,274
<i>I had to act fast.</i>

62
00:04:35,055 --> 00:04:38,148
<i>My parents would have killed me
if they knew what I did that day.</i>

63
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,020
<i>I would have been disinherited, that's for sure.</i>

64
00:04:43,609 --> 00:04:46,101
<i>At the same time, even I wasn't proud of it.</i>

65
00:04:46,492 --> 00:04:49,140
<i>But it had to be done.
It was for a good cause.</i>

66
00:04:51,956 --> 00:04:55,205
<i>I had managed to pay off one of the guys
who worked in the Moulin Rouge’s kitchen</i>

67
00:04:55,463 --> 00:04:57,071
<i>To let us in through the back door.</i>

68
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:01,057
<i>I kept it secret right up to the end.</i>

69
00:05:01,396 --> 00:05:02,716
<i>To the big night.</i>

70
00:05:04,302 --> 00:05:06,716
<i>I always wondered what Stéphane
was thinking that day.</i>

71
00:05:07,896 --> 00:05:10,419
<i>I don't know if I was happy to be here,
or happy for him.</i>

72
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,883
<i>Anyway, his expression was weird—
It was so funny.</i>

73
00:05:16,336 --> 00:05:18,870
<i>Inside, it was another world.</i>

74
00:05:19,692 --> 00:05:21,660
<i>We could already hear the music rumbling,</i>

75
00:05:21,684 --> 00:05:23,942
<i>the ground shaking, people applauding.</i>

76
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:26,871
Step aside, please.
Step aside.

77
00:05:27,554 --> 00:05:29,788
<i>We found ourselves in the wings, backstage.</i>

78
00:05:34,515 --> 00:05:36,650
<i>We passed dancers getting ready
amid all the excitement.</i>

79
00:05:36,674 --> 00:05:38,322
Come on! Hurry up! Two minutes ! Two minutes!

80
00:05:38,346 --> 00:05:40,799
<i>No one paid any attention to us.</i>

81
00:05:40,824 --> 00:05:43,582
<i>We were completely part of
the scenery, part of the crowd.</i>

82
00:05:45,934 --> 00:05:46,950
<i>Then the show.</i>

83
00:05:47,098 --> 00:05:49,207
<i>People laughing, drinking, singing.</i>

84
00:05:49,263 --> 00:05:50,637
<i>All the glitter, all the joy.</i>

85
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:54,600
<i>Stéphane’s eyes were sparkling.</i>

86
00:05:56,733 --> 00:05:59,092
<i>To be honest, it was really amazing.</i>

87
00:06:07,751 --> 00:06:09,431
<i>He left the following day.</i>

88
00:06:13,371 --> 00:06:17,160
<i>Some time later, I found out he ran away
from his military service.</i>

89
00:06:18,906 --> 00:06:20,671
<i>His superiors were furious.</i>

90
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:26,088
<i>Apparently, the refectory door was missing.</i>
