1
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,197
This movie is about...

2
00:00:25,854 --> 00:00:28,761
No, this movie is not about...

3
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:38,156
Get me right. It's so
easy to be misunderstood.

4
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:41,827
This is no exploitation movie,

5
00:00:42,249 --> 00:00:48,836
which encourages all kinds of desires
under the white coat of science.

6
00:00:50,321 --> 00:00:53,129
This movie is much more.

7
00:00:53,615 --> 00:00:55,855
The history of our desires.

8
00:00:56,206 --> 00:00:58,852
How they were scientifically passed on.

9
00:00:59,637 --> 00:01:01,916
Only the moralist would ask today:

10
00:01:02,961 --> 00:01:04,835
What has become of us?

11
00:01:05,164 --> 00:01:08,227
The scientist asks: where did we come from?

12
00:01:08,632 --> 00:01:12,822
And because it is important
to know where we came from,

13
00:01:14,698 --> 00:01:17,837
this movie is necessarily necessary.

14
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:20,622
Uncountable sexes have

15
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:25,811
worked on it's realization.

16
00:01:26,507 --> 00:01:29,026
Because it takes place in
the Age of Enlightenment,

17
00:01:29,596 --> 00:01:31,520
namely in the 18th century,

18
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,841
it is not an enlightenment film.

19
00:01:40,132 --> 00:01:43,056
Man is the measure of all things

20
00:01:44,168 --> 00:01:45,191
says...

21
00:01:46,826 --> 00:01:48,257
No, not Socrates...

22
00:01:49,029 --> 00:01:51,307
But the measure of man is

23
00:01:55,977 --> 00:01:57,066
love.

24
00:01:59,926 --> 00:02:01,154
The nightingale.

25
00:02:03,604 --> 00:02:10,199
Come, come, come, my loveliest birdie,

26
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:16,980
so I don't forget to love.

27
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:24,667
We don't, don't, don't
want to be the laziest.

28
00:02:24,787 --> 00:02:31,621
We do it often, we do it
often, we love doing it.

29
00:02:31,741 --> 00:02:35,600
Come, My Loveliest Birdie...

30
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,276
A sparrow.

31
00:02:54,087 --> 00:02:55,159
Yes.

32
00:02:55,511 --> 00:02:57,152
A common sparrow.

33
00:02:58,042 --> 00:02:59,724
It started with him.

34
00:03:00,504 --> 00:03:03,194
The sparrow was the symbol of love.

35
00:03:03,314 --> 00:03:08,534
Back then for our great-great-great-
great-great-grandparents, the Teutons.

36
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,777
A gray symbol for a gray everyday life.

37
00:03:11,897 --> 00:03:16,683
Because the women had to work and the men had
a high moral understanding of doing nothing.

38
00:03:16,803 --> 00:03:20,320
They were only busy at
drinking and playing dice.

39
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:25,640
But this information is from the
Roman gossip columnist Tacitus.

40
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,418
They lived in shielded moral
purity, not to be lured

41
00:03:29,538 --> 00:03:32,444
by plays, no excitation by banquets.

42
00:03:32,564 --> 00:03:36,166
Their best move that made every
Roman man and woman melt

43
00:03:36,286 --> 00:03:38,183
was their chastity.

44
00:03:38,303 --> 00:03:39,944
Amazing, isn't it?

45
00:03:40,794 --> 00:03:44,671
And there he is: our
great-great-great-great-great- grandfather.

46
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,411
Doesn't he look marvelous?

47
00:03:46,748 --> 00:03:50,051
The Kneipp-sandals from
Wörishofen, the fancy underwear

48
00:03:50,171 --> 00:03:53,523
the leather overhang and the
cuirassierian headdress

49
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,510
and the casual way he is
carrying his spear. Chic.

50
00:04:00,466 --> 00:04:03,274
He walks to the willow of his neighbor

51
00:04:03,394 --> 00:04:06,419
and meets the daughter of
Sig Brand at the spring.

52
00:04:08,213 --> 00:04:14,245
She is called by the modern name
Hildeleiß and is envied because of this.

53
00:04:14,938 --> 00:04:16,283
Hildeleiß.

54
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:24,899
I only thought of you
during the weapon festival.

55
00:04:39,074 --> 00:04:40,103
You're rough,

56
00:04:41,032 --> 00:04:42,773
and you're not the strongest by any means.

57
00:04:43,623 --> 00:04:45,502
Just recently I won five wrestling matches.

58
00:04:46,313 --> 00:04:47,520
Against whom?

59
00:04:47,895 --> 00:04:52,286
Against Gunter, Giselherr,
Ernut, Eckeleich und Sindwich.

60
00:04:52,406 --> 00:04:54,111
Oh, those stupid monkeys.

61
00:04:57,928 --> 00:05:02,616
Tell me, when you sit with Zio
and Dona in Valhalla one day and

62
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:04,455
feast at the eternal pork roast,

63
00:05:04,575 --> 00:05:07,283
may I sit as a sparrow in
the pocket of your skirt?

64
00:05:07,403 --> 00:05:10,978
My God, it hits our
great-great-great-great-great- grandfather.

65
00:05:11,098 --> 00:05:14,538
The sparrow. This is a
real profession of love.

66
00:05:15,468 --> 00:05:16,558
Well then...

67
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:17,983
Then...

68
00:05:18,019 --> 00:05:19,957
Then I tell you now that
I want you to be my wife

69
00:05:20,393 --> 00:05:22,710
and that both of our lives will be united.

70
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:31,110
Slow down young man. Easier said than done.

71
00:05:31,794 --> 00:05:34,933
Don't underestimate our great-great-great-
great-great- grandmothers,

72
00:05:35,225 --> 00:05:38,263
and the girl always belongs
to he who conquers her.

73
00:05:39,617 --> 00:05:45,648
This took a little time. 1 hour,
2 hours, 5 hours, 1 day...

74
00:05:45,768 --> 00:05:48,160
and sometimes the whole night.

75
00:05:49,169 --> 00:05:53,045
This vivacious approach
may not hide the fact

76
00:05:53,165 --> 00:05:57,159
that the customs of the Teutons
were unspeakably strict.

77
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:04,563
Whoever caressed the hand of a married
woman in a dishonorable manner

78
00:06:04,683 --> 00:06:08,025
was punished with a penance
of 15 head of cattle.

79
00:06:09,864 --> 00:06:13,246
For caressing the breasts
it was at least 45.

80
00:06:14,314 --> 00:06:18,428
What nowadays happens
within two hours in a movie

81
00:06:18,548 --> 00:06:22,938
couldn't be paid for by the whole
of the united Teuton tribes.

82
00:06:51,115 --> 00:06:54,596
Marriage was relatively easy then.

83
00:06:54,716 --> 00:06:57,216
Because the law of custom said:

84
00:06:57,336 --> 00:07:01,035
If a man and a woman agree that they want

85
00:07:01,155 --> 00:07:06,490
to lay next to each other, they are
husband and wife when they get up again.

86
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:19,039
Today they still live so
abstinently and so morally.

87
00:07:21,031 --> 00:07:25,322
Then one day the messengers
of a new morality appeared.

88
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:29,145
They came directly out of
the Roman sink of iniquity,

89
00:07:29,862 --> 00:07:32,369
but they didn't come
full of humility. Oh no.

90
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:36,571
They came with a sparkling
eye, with torch and sword

91
00:07:36,691 --> 00:07:39,834
and entered the cabins under the beds.

92
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,429
What shall your marriage be? An union?

93
00:07:44,847 --> 00:07:48,682
A contract? A natural get-together?

94
00:07:49,165 --> 00:07:51,988
An execution through physical union?

95
00:07:53,177 --> 00:07:56,279
I tell you, if you think this way ...

96
00:07:56,772 --> 00:07:58,760
Marriage is a sacrament.

97
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:02,718
Something mental. Spiritual.

98
00:08:03,237 --> 00:08:09,465
The sexual act is bestial, disgusting,
and just a necessary evil.

99
00:08:10,127 --> 00:08:14,874
That was it. Suddenly all
the innocence was gone.

100
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,583
Twilight of the Gods.

101
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,153
One was afraid.

102
00:08:20,988 --> 00:08:24,658
The world was upside-down and
no one could explain why.

103
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:33,329
Now in all corners sat the
demons of the new religion.

104
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:44,627
But luckily the Teutons still had a pagan
antidote against demons and devils.

105
00:08:44,747 --> 00:08:49,440
The holy nudity. And our
great-grandfathers did one more thing.

106
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:55,547
They turned in every direction and
broke wind against the ghosts.

107
00:09:00,912 --> 00:09:03,557
But it was useless.

108
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,151
The friars remained the winners.

109
00:09:06,942 --> 00:09:11,788
They castrated the pagans
symbols, logged the holy trees

110
00:09:12,974 --> 00:09:16,485
and depopulated the lakeside.

111
00:09:16,605 --> 00:09:19,699
A new spirit wakes over the water.

112
00:09:19,819 --> 00:09:22,963
From now on it was written
everywhere: no nude bathing.

113
00:09:24,087 --> 00:09:30,020
Our great-great-great-great-great-grandparents
were afraid of hell, the devil, and purgatory.

114
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:34,026
But our great-great-great-great-great-
grandmothers became, according to

115
00:09:34,146 --> 00:09:36,869
the new opinion, vessels of sin.

116
00:09:37,487 --> 00:09:42,357
Mulier Taceat. That women must keep
quiet was preached by the new lords.

117
00:09:42,477 --> 00:09:45,374
Fine. The woman kept quiet.

118
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:49,052
She kept quiet for centuries.

119
00:09:49,448 --> 00:09:52,934
But when again she opened her
mouth her revenge was terrible.

120
00:09:53,601 --> 00:09:58,373
And thereby on the surface it
became better for our ladies.

121
00:09:58,493 --> 00:10:01,142
There were beautifully decorated
rooms, comfortable chairs,

122
00:10:01,262 --> 00:10:03,144
and even eiderdowns.

123
00:10:10,493 --> 00:10:17,316
In the shadows of these castles one of the most
strange flowers in the story of love was blooming.

124
00:10:18,182 --> 00:10:19,443
The courtly love.

125
00:10:22,385 --> 00:10:25,381
How did it get this way? Very easy.

126
00:10:25,501 --> 00:10:28,644
An idea grabbed the people
of the Western world.

127
00:10:28,764 --> 00:10:31,042
The idea of crusades to the Holy Land.

128
00:10:31,463 --> 00:10:34,108
Finally a concrete thing
for the loving God.

129
00:10:34,228 --> 00:10:36,234
Even if one doesn't understand much,

130
00:10:36,354 --> 00:10:38,435
this language was understood immediately.

131
00:10:39,325 --> 00:10:42,316
The godly knight left dinner,

132
00:10:42,737 --> 00:10:44,319
put on the armor,

133
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,434
saddled his horse,

134
00:10:48,016 --> 00:10:50,365
robbed the piggy bank,

135
00:10:51,107 --> 00:10:54,667
and gave his wife a last kiss.

136
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:58,845
With a freshly sewn cross on his
back he struggled onto the horse.

137
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:02,776
Then he rode off towards
endless adventures.

138
00:11:02,896 --> 00:11:07,202
Towards the wounds, swords,
and the 70,000 bugs.

139
00:11:08,253 --> 00:11:11,665
The noble woman was suddenly all alone.

140
00:11:12,209 --> 00:11:14,162
That was breathtaking

141
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:18,488
and instantly she made the best of it.

142
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,827
She learned to powder.

143
00:11:21,565 --> 00:11:23,755
Therefore she used cornstarch.

144
00:11:24,084 --> 00:11:26,223
Oh, there you are.

145
00:11:27,995 --> 00:11:29,286
So, watch out.

146
00:11:30,641 --> 00:11:33,347
I want you to cut down here

147
00:11:33,467 --> 00:11:36,191
Set the cut here. Understood?

148
00:11:36,311 --> 00:11:38,659
And then it happened.

149
00:11:39,086 --> 00:11:44,086
One was ready for guests to be
invited for lime blossom tea.

150
00:11:48,053 --> 00:11:50,996
Knight Kuno of Hohenebersberg

151
00:11:51,116 --> 00:11:54,050
was one of those who quit the crusades.

152
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:57,665
They made profit according to
the motto 'make love not war',

153
00:11:57,785 --> 00:12:01,621
because they knew which
castle was without a man.

154
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,537
Certain merchants also knew this.

155
00:12:05,657 --> 00:12:08,721
...Venetian glass my dear ladies.

156
00:12:08,841 --> 00:12:14,181
Fresh out of the south. A cheap leftover,
a little off-color, but highly enjoyable.

157
00:12:22,535 --> 00:12:26,237
Pali, Parabiki Pali! Delicious
things from Venice!

158
00:12:26,357 --> 00:12:32,376
And therefore, dear lady, his Eminence,
our Reverend, the Bishop decided,

159
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:38,480
that the use of these artificial privates,
which were offered just recently

160
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:44,129
by shameless merchants from
Florence and Venice are a vitiation

161
00:12:44,249 --> 00:12:47,072
of the holy sacrament of the marriage,

162
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,807
and must be seen as the
Devil's work from now on.

163
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:55,035
You bring me amazing news, dear clergyman.

164
00:12:55,155 --> 00:12:58,405
Till now I didn't even know
that it was possible to

165
00:12:58,525 --> 00:13:02,129
change the beloved one against such magic.

166
00:13:02,629 --> 00:13:06,616
Well, now you know,

167
00:13:07,147 --> 00:13:11,078
and I hope that you will
always find refuge in prayer

168
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,811
and not in the devil's artificiality.

169
00:13:16,542 --> 00:13:20,432
Pali, Parabiki Pali! Delicious
things from Venice!

170
00:13:20,552 --> 00:13:25,327
If you feel the urge in a terrible
way, just call me to stand by you.

171
00:13:31,217 --> 00:13:35,840
There are already enough to
stand by me, dear padre.

172
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,301
Welcome cousin Kuno. Oh.

173
00:13:46,495 --> 00:13:53,689
Ed venus in tucas in tentationem
sed libera nos a malo.

174
00:13:54,431 --> 00:13:59,203
Well, that was really, no,
that was really not necessary.

175
00:14:03,381 --> 00:14:08,400
Despite -- or let's say because of
this -- castle life became lively.

176
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:12,950
The lords of this age soon
had the right idea: music.

177
00:14:13,296 --> 00:14:17,821
Music makes one optimistic. A
golden age of tinkling started.

178
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:22,617
Every lord of a castle had his fans, with
a mish-mash of symbolic Maria lyrics,

179
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:28,848
hits, and mirthful Altheidelberg erotic
ballads, they sing about their idols.

180
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:36,731
It jumps, jumps, jumps youthfully in me.

181
00:14:36,851 --> 00:14:48,675
It jumps, jumps, jumps
youthfully in me. In me.

182
00:14:52,137 --> 00:14:57,750
Let us kiss, let us joke, my
dear, joke and kiss with me.

183
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:01,819
Laugh and kiss, laugh and joke...

184
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,926
Single women are inventive.

185
00:15:23,046 --> 00:15:25,673
They invented a new party game.

186
00:15:25,793 --> 00:15:29,782
A hugely exciting game:
Who will it be today?

187
00:15:30,098 --> 00:15:34,339
The one, to whom she threw the
glove or the one to whom she blew.

188
00:15:35,605 --> 00:15:38,503
The one she gave the little shoe,

189
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:43,434
or the one whose appetite
she assuaged with cakes.

190
00:15:49,322 --> 00:15:51,183
No, no, no, no.

191
00:15:52,111 --> 00:15:56,668
For sure it is this one. The one
who accompanies her to the bath.

192
00:16:07,477 --> 00:16:08,794
The poor guy

193
00:16:26,601 --> 00:16:29,790
in pain he had to see
her how God created her

194
00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:31,601
and if she was good-looking

195
00:16:31,721 --> 00:16:34,284
she had to be so in the following way:

196
00:16:35,215 --> 00:16:37,684
With thin ankles and long legs

197
00:16:37,804 --> 00:16:40,380
with not too big, rather small breasts

198
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,595
which must be bare and round
like paradise apples,

199
00:16:43,715 --> 00:16:47,329
with long neck, small oval ears,

200
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:49,772
with swelling pout,

201
00:16:49,892 --> 00:16:51,519
narrow white teeth,

202
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:54,583
with a sharp pink tongue,

203
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:59,510
slim, but not skinny or flat,

204
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:02,421
the hips swaying, the arms full

205
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:05,269
the fingers gentle and thin,

206
00:17:05,389 --> 00:17:07,096
with pink nails.

207
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:12,590
Oh yes, he had to crave.

208
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:15,236
He wasn't allowed to stay over night.

209
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:21,343
Finally the noble count
Heinreich has the privilege to

210
00:17:21,463 --> 00:17:24,389
lead the lady into the bedroom.

211
00:17:44,343 --> 00:17:46,970
An epistle, noble lady.

212
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:50,150
Just released. The newest.

213
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:53,537
Commodo efficatur

214
00:17:53,657 --> 00:17:57,094
ut feminat coitus tulcitudinem senti hat.

215
00:17:57,676 --> 00:17:59,562
How to achieve it

216
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:02,473
so that the woman feels the

217
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:05,005
sweetness of intercourse.

218
00:18:06,702 --> 00:18:08,955
Femina est omnis divisa in partes tres.

219
00:18:09,075 --> 00:18:10,246
You're astonished?

220
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:15,841
It is proven that such epistles already
existed half a millennium ago.

221
00:18:19,085 --> 00:18:22,060
Even Count Heinrich
bitterly experienced that

222
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:25,186
the popular science of sex education

223
00:18:25,306 --> 00:18:28,148
doesn't prevent a lady from falling asleep.

224
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:50,097
Love mania was a common phenomenon then.

225
00:18:50,447 --> 00:18:52,966
Cousin Kuno covered himself in wolfskin and

226
00:18:53,086 --> 00:18:55,257
poured out his woes.

227
00:18:55,814 --> 00:19:00,016
The dogs of the castle, which
knew nothing of courtly love,

228
00:19:00,136 --> 00:19:02,794
misunderstood the crying.

229
00:19:07,908 --> 00:19:11,879
Knight Kuno came back down to earth

230
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:15,234
when the man of the house returned.

231
00:19:19,727 --> 00:19:20,961
No, thanks.

232
00:19:25,813 --> 00:19:27,491
There he was standing.

233
00:19:28,044 --> 00:19:30,259
The worn-out homecomer.

234
00:19:30,829 --> 00:19:33,060
And if the rumors he heard along the way

235
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,425
are true then singing wasn't

236
00:19:35,545 --> 00:19:38,795
the only thing that was done here.

237
00:20:11,297 --> 00:20:15,970
It's a real vexation, my dear husband.
Such a long time without male protection.

238
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,678
Hardly could I resist the tormentors.

239
00:20:19,422 --> 00:20:21,811
You don't need to worry from now on.

240
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,359
You will be well protected

241
00:20:24,665 --> 00:20:26,706
even if I have to leave again.

242
00:20:38,382 --> 00:20:40,376
Well, better not to speak of it.

243
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:43,509
No time to rest.

244
00:20:43,629 --> 00:20:47,322
The Pope is calling again and
emperor Konrad needs his faithful.

245
00:20:55,248 --> 00:20:56,340
Bring the basket.

246
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,593
- It's just for your safety.
- That's a...

247
00:21:01,713 --> 00:21:03,840
A masterwork of iron smithery.

248
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,826
Of iron?

249
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:07,283
One wears it around the crotch
in honor of her husband.

250
00:21:07,403 --> 00:21:10,099
- Around the crotch? If it doesn't fit?
- It always fits.

251
00:21:10,219 --> 00:21:12,125
You were gone so long. I gained weight.

252
00:21:12,245 --> 00:21:14,767
I made it adjustable. 17 holes.

253
00:21:14,887 --> 00:21:17,704
- It doesn't match the robe.
- One wears it underneath.

254
00:21:19,167 --> 00:21:22,055
The chastity belt was made of iron,

255
00:21:22,175 --> 00:21:24,310
was put on from below,

256
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:26,940
and was lockable with a key.

257
00:21:27,533 --> 00:21:31,560
It was crafted so cleverly, that
the woman, after she was bound,

258
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:35,733
couldn't get rid of it
because of the sweet lust.

259
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:40,203
A small hole allowed her... to pee.

260
00:21:40,895 --> 00:21:44,218
So it was written in an old
courtly love chronicle.

261
00:21:48,673 --> 00:21:49,762
Well,

262
00:21:50,908 --> 00:21:52,332
do you feel comfortable?

263
00:21:52,688 --> 00:21:54,903
What am I supposed to do when it rusts?

264
00:21:55,437 --> 00:21:59,235
A bottle of rose oil will prevent this.
Goodbye.

265
00:22:11,947 --> 00:22:15,587
The keys, my dear husband, the keys!

266
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,038
You? Cousin Kuno?

267
00:22:27,158 --> 00:22:29,747
I came to be heard by you. Finally.

268
00:22:29,867 --> 00:22:33,168
- There's no lock that can't be opened.
- Don't dare it.

269
00:22:33,288 --> 00:22:36,155
How can you accept such a disgrace?

270
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:37,911
Long live freedom

271
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,974
and the locksmiths' guild!

272
00:22:46,268 --> 00:22:48,167
It's the will of my master.

273
00:22:48,287 --> 00:22:49,449
Who mistrusts you!

274
00:22:50,066 --> 00:22:54,433
And you think one of these
keys will fit the lock?

275
00:22:55,034 --> 00:22:57,107
The lock is from Florence.

276
00:22:58,041 --> 00:22:59,844
So are the keys.

277
00:23:06,495 --> 00:23:08,267
Oh, Kuno.

278
00:23:11,384 --> 00:23:13,837
Kuno, what do you have in mind?

279
00:23:15,178 --> 00:23:16,381
It tickles.

280
00:23:22,393 --> 00:23:25,052
More light, it's too dark here.

281
00:23:27,496 --> 00:23:28,746
Oh, Kuno.

282
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:34,964
Do you still have hope, Kuno?

283
00:23:35,084 --> 00:23:37,543
Of course, till the last key.

284
00:23:44,001 --> 00:23:45,188
Kuno.

285
00:23:46,849 --> 00:23:48,273
Kuno.

286
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:50,377
The last one.

287
00:23:51,137 --> 00:23:53,051
It's a curse.

288
00:23:53,454 --> 00:23:54,799
One of the evil kind.

289
00:23:54,919 --> 00:23:56,572
No, one of modern technology.

290
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,293
To the plague with this technology!

291
00:24:00,053 --> 00:24:01,176
The plague.

292
00:24:02,078 --> 00:24:03,787
It didn't just take the technology.

293
00:24:04,483 --> 00:24:06,018
It also took the humans.

294
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:09,275
At once the tinkling stopped.

295
00:24:09,654 --> 00:24:13,816
It became dead silent in
the salons and castles.

296
00:24:14,528 --> 00:24:17,882
The plague was all over the Western world.

297
00:24:19,822 --> 00:24:23,556
Actually there was only one
bright spot in the 14th century.

298
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:28,018
One of the most comforting
inventions was made: schnapps.

299
00:24:28,683 --> 00:24:32,179
It was invented by a certain
Arnaldus von Villa Nova.

300
00:24:32,299 --> 00:24:35,110
Like a joke of world history, Mr. Arnaldus

301
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:38,528
was a doctor, an apostle of
health, and so the name he gave

302
00:24:38,648 --> 00:24:41,344
the brandy makes sense.

303
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:50,621
Water of life.

304
00:24:51,538 --> 00:24:53,152
Aqua vitae.

305
00:24:55,004 --> 00:24:56,052
Cheers!

306
00:24:57,527 --> 00:24:59,703
We will need this comforter,

307
00:25:00,296 --> 00:25:03,401
because the 14th century became the darkest

308
00:25:03,521 --> 00:25:06,684
and most awkward of German history,

309
00:25:07,476 --> 00:25:09,117
not only because of the plague.

310
00:25:09,631 --> 00:25:12,677
The church took revenge on
the age of courtly love

311
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:16,537
and swung strongly toward
restitution of power.

312
00:25:16,933 --> 00:25:20,699
The declared goal was: <i>back to fear</i>.

313
00:25:21,632 --> 00:25:24,844
A wild mysticism took
over the Western world.

314
00:25:24,964 --> 00:25:28,224
There were witches and
warlocks and possessed humans,

315
00:25:28,344 --> 00:25:30,497
who were said to have had
intercourse with the devil.

316
00:25:31,151 --> 00:25:35,360
Doctors, lawyers, and philosophers
developed a whole sexual science,

317
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,746
which stated all the details of
this intercourse with the devil.

318
00:25:42,842 --> 00:25:46,181
From now on it was said that he or she

319
00:25:46,782 --> 00:25:48,080
or those

320
00:25:53,915 --> 00:25:56,161
and it was put to the young and seductive

321
00:25:56,709 --> 00:26:00,734
because they were preferred by the devil.

322
00:26:01,533 --> 00:26:04,457
A verbal testimony was
enough for an arrest.

323
00:26:05,736 --> 00:26:10,191
The inquisitors were bitten
by a sexual delirium.

324
00:26:10,625 --> 00:26:13,752
Didn't gentlemen always
want to look at girls?

325
00:26:14,182 --> 00:26:15,309
Here they were.

326
00:26:15,537 --> 00:26:16,584
In the nude.

327
00:26:16,765 --> 00:26:17,852
Bare naked.

328
00:26:24,951 --> 00:26:28,521
When the devil approaches a human,

329
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,920
he creates out of air an earthly body,

330
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,194
which he thickens with vapors.

331
00:26:36,302 --> 00:26:38,221
If his victim is a man,

332
00:26:39,308 --> 00:26:42,334
the devil takes the form of a succubus --

333
00:26:42,454 --> 00:26:44,589
<i>one lying beneath</i>.

334
00:26:45,222 --> 00:26:47,081
For a female victim,

335
00:26:48,261 --> 00:26:50,971
he will transform into an incubus --

336
00:26:51,821 --> 00:26:53,760
<i>one lying above</i>.

337
00:26:54,551 --> 00:26:56,054
The devil

338
00:26:56,687 --> 00:26:58,585
has no sperm.

339
00:26:58,705 --> 00:27:01,358
Figment of the imagination? No.

340
00:27:01,478 --> 00:27:03,490
Also of the reality then.

341
00:27:03,847 --> 00:27:08,594
Whoever wanted to escape this darkness went
into the woods and drank a mysterious potion

342
00:27:08,714 --> 00:27:13,934
made of thimble belladonna, henbane, rubbed herself
with a magic salve and was fucked by the Devil.

343
00:27:14,911 --> 00:27:19,658
It couldn't have been such a great pleasure.
The only member that the devil could have had

344
00:27:19,778 --> 00:27:23,539
with special beauty and
glory on his body was

345
00:27:23,659 --> 00:27:27,347
horrible, so the tortured said.

346
00:27:28,973 --> 00:27:31,940
It is covered with fish scales.

347
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,819
It is made of iron.

348
00:27:35,401 --> 00:27:38,640
It is a blazing flame.

349
00:27:39,307 --> 00:27:40,964
The witness may come forward.

350
00:27:41,706 --> 00:27:44,648
The fifth main part of the Malleus
Maleficarum deals with the art

351
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:46,898
of stealing manhood.

352
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:49,420
Franz Margus Bossert

353
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,744
of the house of Bassau.

354
00:27:54,315 --> 00:27:57,332
What do you have to
announce, honorable priest?

355
00:27:58,197 --> 00:28:00,867
One day while I was hearing confession,

356
00:28:01,188 --> 00:28:06,059
this young boy came and loudly
complained that he had lost his manhood.

357
00:28:06,802 --> 00:28:10,387
I saw for myself although in
a disinterested way only.

358
00:28:10,955 --> 00:28:14,540
When the young man took down his
clothes and showed me the empty place,

359
00:28:15,131 --> 00:28:18,370
I asked him if he knew of a woman

360
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:23,537
who could be responsible. He told
me he knew one, who is said to

361
00:28:23,657 --> 00:28:27,617
collect manhoods. Tell it my son.

362
00:28:29,425 --> 00:28:33,159
I found her in the nude
under a tree at a full moon

363
00:28:33,554 --> 00:28:35,507
with snakes around her neck.

364
00:28:36,595 --> 00:28:41,589
She was brewing something in a bowl.
I asked her if she had stolen

365
00:28:41,709 --> 00:28:47,004
my manhood. She nodded and
started to laugh. She sat there.

366
00:28:51,482 --> 00:28:53,732
Did you steal my manhood?

367
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,946
It's up there in the nest. Get it.

368
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:01,644
So I climbed up.

369
00:29:03,819 --> 00:29:06,217
I found many manhoods up there.

370
00:29:06,737 --> 00:29:09,753
They were moving like
young birds in the nest.

371
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:14,452
Since I couldn't find mine at once, I
took a bigger one. Then she called.

372
00:29:14,572 --> 00:29:16,864
No, not the big one, that belongs to...

373
00:29:16,984 --> 00:29:20,132
He who claims that all of
this is dream and fantasy

374
00:29:20,765 --> 00:29:24,542
denies the awe, which we owe
our mother, the Church.

375
00:29:24,662 --> 00:29:27,806
Because the Church punishes no crimes,

376
00:29:27,926 --> 00:29:31,425
unless they are certain and obvious.

377
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:35,121
He who thinks the Church is wrong

378
00:29:35,714 --> 00:29:37,138
be damned.

379
00:29:38,455 --> 00:29:41,936
Our great-great-grandmother
didn't want to be damned.

380
00:29:42,056 --> 00:29:44,547
It was terrible. Very terrible,

381
00:29:44,667 --> 00:29:48,030
but it was very interesting
and terribly exciting.

382
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:51,986
One experienced sensual fantasies,
not like mother and grandmother

383
00:29:52,106 --> 00:29:56,476
with reddened cheeks, but
shivering and white as a ghost.

384
00:29:57,569 --> 00:29:59,785
The bath is ready.

385
00:30:02,461 --> 00:30:07,006
What followed went as a
great cleansing in history.

386
00:30:07,879 --> 00:30:10,119
We know this well enough.

387
00:30:10,439 --> 00:30:13,692
The bathing hysteria broke out in Germany.

388
00:30:16,666 --> 00:30:21,059
It didn't take long and it started babble
in all courtyards, castles and town houses.

389
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:25,673
In tubs and vats. Bathing
became a true passion.

390
00:30:25,793 --> 00:30:29,643
It is nowadays comparable to say,
"Let's meet at the Café Kranzler"...

391
00:30:29,763 --> 00:30:34,452
or at the Franziskaner. That was the
latest news. Deals were started

392
00:30:34,572 --> 00:30:39,041
and finished. Old friends
were met and new ones found.

393
00:30:39,161 --> 00:30:41,711
No, no, you will sit in the front.

394
00:30:46,442 --> 00:30:49,587
I don't know. I can't find
anything sickly in the urine.

395
00:30:52,435 --> 00:30:55,639
The bath-keeper was some kind of quack.

396
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:59,061
He was on the same level with the
executioner and the brothel owner,

397
00:30:59,181 --> 00:31:02,849
but he knew what a bad name can be worth.

398
00:31:03,935 --> 00:31:09,671
The new photo spread, Mr. Rat.
Very cheap, only 3 pfennig.

399
00:31:12,143 --> 00:31:14,259
Not that exciting.

400
00:31:14,379 --> 00:31:18,630
Maybe a little powder. The newest.
Lytta vesicatoria.

401
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:22,368
Dried diuretic tea of the Spanish fly.

402
00:31:22,488 --> 00:31:24,608
Real hellish stuff.

403
00:31:24,728 --> 00:31:27,931
Turns a daisy into an oak.

404
00:31:28,346 --> 00:31:29,988
Don't promise too much.

405
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:33,647
Agnes will deliver what
the powder promises.

406
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:38,025
At which hour does Mr. Rat want our Agnes?
We have a large crowd today.

407
00:31:38,145 --> 00:31:40,320
Maybe in half an hour.

408
00:31:41,328 --> 00:31:48,587
I suppose our dean will lose soon.
Checkmate!

409
00:31:48,707 --> 00:31:52,792
You're not even 14 years old and
already bring shame on your mother.

410
00:31:52,912 --> 00:31:56,091
You lost your virginity at the age of 12!

411
00:31:56,211 --> 00:31:58,758
Oh, shut up. Cheeky girl.

412
00:31:58,878 --> 00:32:01,542
You're taking my men and
you even have a husband.

413
00:32:01,662 --> 00:32:04,606
I told you to shut up. Do what you want.

414
00:32:04,726 --> 00:32:06,277
Don't look when...

415
00:32:06,654 --> 00:32:07,932
when I'm in courtly love.

416
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:11,654
The air was full of erotic and body odors,

417
00:32:11,958 --> 00:32:14,236
but the joy of love was not indecent.

418
00:32:14,356 --> 00:32:17,210
The influence of the
Renaissance was felt even in

419
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:19,900
clerical circles, resulting in
a certain natural relaxation.

420
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:22,907
Where is it written, that it is
not allowed for a monk to bathe?

421
00:32:23,027 --> 00:32:24,448
Stop, I know this.

422
00:32:24,568 --> 00:32:28,546
You take a bath and show you don't
have any money in your habit.

423
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:37,655
Come in, brother. Get into the water.

424
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:41,801
No big business, if only the
citizens and the monks are coming.

425
00:32:42,181 --> 00:32:46,350
Recently Emporer Wenzel was with 800
knights in Ulm for a whole week.

426
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:50,116
The magistrate called for
back-up from Augsburg.

427
00:32:50,236 --> 00:32:55,148
By the way 1500 whores arrived in Konstanz.

428
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:57,267
I talked to our Maray.

429
00:32:57,615 --> 00:32:58,627
She said,

430
00:32:59,118 --> 00:33:01,365
she already earned 800 guilder.

431
00:33:01,665 --> 00:33:04,039
No surprise. You could do

432
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:08,042
Maray seven days a week, right Agnes?

433
00:33:08,162 --> 00:33:10,925
You get a big mouth with 55 years.

434
00:33:11,045 --> 00:33:13,377
A healthy man takes his
potency into the grave.

435
00:33:13,497 --> 00:33:16,700
Don't you know the saying:
<i>Once is a promise</i>

436
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,678
<i>twice the way of men,</i>

437
00:33:18,798 --> 00:33:20,672
<i>thrice the aristocrats duty,</i>

438
00:33:20,792 --> 00:33:23,105
<i>four times the women's right.</i>

439
00:33:23,225 --> 00:33:25,367
But the old Greek Solan said,

440
00:33:25,487 --> 00:33:28,500
"Thrice a month is
sufficient in a marriage."

441
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:31,665
Ah, marriage. The old sodomite.

442
00:33:31,785 --> 00:33:34,197
Don't you know what Martin Luther preached?

443
00:33:34,317 --> 00:33:39,546
"Twice a week doesn't harm me or she...
and pays the women."

444
00:33:39,666 --> 00:33:42,489
Oh please, Martin Luther
isn't even born yet.

445
00:33:42,609 --> 00:33:44,419
What damage does it do if he's right?

446
00:33:47,172 --> 00:33:49,435
Tell me, bath keeper, who
is that maiden over there?

447
00:33:49,555 --> 00:33:50,558
- She?
- Yes.

448
00:33:50,678 --> 00:33:52,394
That's the niece of the mayor.

449
00:33:52,514 --> 00:33:54,055
She's on visit from Saxony.

450
00:33:54,175 --> 00:33:56,603
Oh boy, the girls from
Saxony really got it.

451
00:33:56,723 --> 00:33:59,277
Swedish girls need a lot of talk,

452
00:34:00,881 --> 00:34:03,792
girls from Hesse should be forgotten,

453
00:34:03,912 --> 00:34:08,603
but girls from Saxony
are made for doing it.

454
00:34:08,723 --> 00:34:12,036
Hurry, bath keeper, tell her.
It will be worth it.

455
00:34:14,789 --> 00:34:18,175
The junker, the junker over there.

456
00:34:27,064 --> 00:34:29,944
My name is Alvin Jobst and
I'm the right candidate.

457
00:34:30,064 --> 00:34:32,397
Hanille is my name and I'm here on a visit.

458
00:34:32,517 --> 00:34:34,659
You've got a very nice tub, Mr. Jobst.

459
00:34:34,779 --> 00:34:36,352
Do you want to come in?

460
00:34:36,472 --> 00:34:37,745
Of course.

461
00:34:49,226 --> 00:34:53,082
I'm sorry, I thought it was my foot.

462
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:45,023
I don't know, I can't find anything sickly.

463
00:35:45,636 --> 00:35:48,840
It's probably this new unknown fever.

464
00:35:49,137 --> 00:35:50,482
What fever?

465
00:35:50,602 --> 00:35:53,923
Certainly you've heard of
that Spanish adventurer?

466
00:35:54,043 --> 00:35:56,732
- What adventurer?
- Christopher Columbus.

467
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:58,931
He brought it here from America.

468
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:02,828
It is called syphilis.

469
00:36:03,421 --> 00:36:05,142
The horror was terrible.

470
00:36:05,262 --> 00:36:07,594
The new disease was worse than the plague

471
00:36:07,714 --> 00:36:09,295
and was almost deadly every time.

472
00:36:09,415 --> 00:36:11,451
The bath houses were closed down,

473
00:36:12,031 --> 00:36:16,976
but other doors, nearly forgotten during
the bathing period, opened again.

474
00:36:17,096 --> 00:36:21,031
High indulgences were paid
to come clean with God.

475
00:36:21,324 --> 00:36:24,667
Whoever was still afraid
was told by Luther,

476
00:36:25,161 --> 00:36:30,422
<i>Whoever dies shall be carried
to his grave with farts.</i>

477
00:36:30,542 --> 00:36:35,149
To make the people understand
one had to be drastic.

478
00:36:36,257 --> 00:36:39,560
Humanism and Reformation
became a talking point,

479
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,973
but only the wise dealt with it.

480
00:36:42,093 --> 00:36:47,254
The people remained stubborn,
naive and incredibly sensual

481
00:36:47,374 --> 00:36:50,933
and the more dark the wise
acted, the more fun it was

482
00:36:51,053 --> 00:36:57,245
for the middle class to behave
rude, uninhibited, and antiquated.

483
00:37:00,158 --> 00:37:06,349
Come my lovely birds. We
want, we want, we want...

484
00:37:06,469 --> 00:37:07,991
A remarkable time.

485
00:37:08,111 --> 00:37:12,480
Boisterous poetry, rude
portrayals in the fine arts

486
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:17,010
and at the same time the transition
of the mind to Humanism.

487
00:37:20,312 --> 00:37:22,191
- Bärbel?
- Yes.

488
00:37:37,327 --> 00:37:41,362
Outside the stakes of the
Inquisition were still burning

489
00:37:41,482 --> 00:37:45,100
even in Protestant regions,
because the torture chambers

490
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:48,225
of the Lutherans were not
inferior to the Catholic ones.

491
00:37:48,796 --> 00:37:53,049
Inside the rebirth of the
senses were celebrated.

492
00:37:53,405 --> 00:37:55,303
The joy of pleasure,

493
00:37:55,877 --> 00:37:57,657
of flawless bodies,

494
00:37:57,777 --> 00:38:02,859
of jewelry, of everything that was
considered beautiful, fashionable,

495
00:38:02,979 --> 00:38:04,718
and appreciated then.

496
00:38:05,007 --> 00:38:08,528
They didn't have the cream
pots of the Elizabethans,

497
00:38:08,648 --> 00:38:11,890
so pork dripping was used
for body care instead.

498
00:38:13,967 --> 00:38:17,942
My beautiful wife, I'm telling you,

499
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:21,997
has a proud head from Prague,

500
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:28,643
two swift eyes from France, a
swelling mouth from Austria,

501
00:38:29,554 --> 00:38:33,578
two tender hands from Cologne,

502
00:38:33,698 --> 00:38:38,147
and from Brabant two slender loins,

503
00:38:39,059 --> 00:38:43,114
long breasts from the Netherlands,

504
00:38:43,885 --> 00:38:47,584
the bush from Bavaria,

505
00:38:48,276 --> 00:38:55,258
a round ass from Swabia.
That's what my dear wife has.

506
00:38:56,898 --> 00:39:01,190
Did you know that 3 hard, 3 soft, 3 short

507
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:05,799
3 long, 3 red, 3 white, and 3 black
things a beautiful woman must own?

508
00:39:06,214 --> 00:39:09,220
The 3 hard are...um...

509
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:11,337
the two breasts and the ass.

510
00:39:11,457 --> 00:39:14,380
The soft ones are the two
hands and the belly,

511
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:17,584
the short ones are the
nose and the two feet,

512
00:39:17,704 --> 00:39:20,946
the long ones are the
fingers and the two thighs,

513
00:39:21,066 --> 00:39:24,269
the red ones are the two
cheeks and the mouth,

514
00:39:24,661 --> 00:39:28,518
the white ones are the
two legs and the neck,

515
00:39:28,638 --> 00:39:32,018
the black ones are the two eyes and...

516
00:39:32,138 --> 00:39:35,476
That's not true, yours is shaved!

517
00:39:35,596 --> 00:39:38,858
Hurry. The Fugger opening
is in three hours.

518
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:42,398
The pork dripping is dabbed off

519
00:39:42,518 --> 00:39:46,868
and the skin powdered just
so she is not shining.

520
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:52,446
Only now come the clothes.

521
00:39:52,566 --> 00:39:54,532
Bottom first.

522
00:39:54,908 --> 00:39:58,706
No, no, it wasn't there then. First

523
00:39:58,826 --> 00:40:03,927
a wrinkled shift, fine woven
and almost transparent,

524
00:40:04,441 --> 00:40:05,569
and nothing else.

525
00:40:06,063 --> 00:40:10,491
Then the valuable outer garment
with a wide plaid skirt.

526
00:40:10,611 --> 00:40:13,953
All very colourful and very gorgeous.

527
00:40:14,249 --> 00:40:17,275
Fashion demands that the
waist is emphasized

528
00:40:19,253 --> 00:40:21,587
and a lot more.

529
00:40:21,707 --> 00:40:23,506
The breasts are very covered.

530
00:40:26,342 --> 00:40:27,390
So

531
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:31,504
Now, one can put a yardstick on it.

532
00:40:32,078 --> 00:40:33,719
You look beautiful.

533
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:35,875
Where have you been for so long?

534
00:40:36,211 --> 00:40:39,139
Every time it takes you
longer to get dressed.

535
00:40:39,594 --> 00:40:41,295
Where will this lead

536
00:40:41,716 --> 00:40:43,278
with all this frippery?

537
00:40:43,398 --> 00:40:47,194
My beloved husband, we in
Germany are truly reasonable.

538
00:40:47,689 --> 00:40:50,339
Helga Prost told me in church today

539
00:40:50,459 --> 00:40:54,512
that there are women in Rome which
bought permission from the Pope

540
00:40:54,632 --> 00:40:57,835
to walk in trousers and wear
rapiers at their sides.

541
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:00,651
But this will not happen here.

542
00:41:01,046 --> 00:41:05,061
Today we debated in the council if
we shouldn't do it like in Zurich.

543
00:41:07,771 --> 00:41:11,944
Only the dishonest women there are allowed
to wear finery without limitations.

544
00:41:12,489 --> 00:41:15,812
Now no honest women want
to be mistaken in Zurich.

545
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:18,521
What's the point? Are we poor?

546
00:41:18,818 --> 00:41:22,398
It's not about the money, it's
more about a bad example.

547
00:41:22,518 --> 00:41:26,593
The mayor Feidgundlinger arranged
a wedding for his daughter

548
00:41:26,713 --> 00:41:31,360
with 60 tables and 270 guest for 8 days.

549
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,287
Where does the example of
such a simple man lead?

550
00:41:34,407 --> 00:41:36,482
Today he can, because he has the money.

551
00:41:36,602 --> 00:41:39,286
Tomorrow others want the money to do it.

552
00:41:39,406 --> 00:41:41,798
That's a screw with no end in sight.

553
00:41:41,918 --> 00:41:44,745
Fine, soon we will go naked.

554
00:41:50,797 --> 00:41:52,775
Bärbel, bring him a handkerchief.

555
00:41:58,497 --> 00:41:59,606
What should I do with this?

556
00:41:59,626 --> 00:42:02,295
- One doesn't blow his nose this way.
- How else?

557
00:42:02,415 --> 00:42:06,369
Listen to what the wise Eramus
of Rotterdam writes about it.

558
00:42:06,783 --> 00:42:10,185
<i>To blow the nose into his cap
or his sleeve is uncouth.</i>

559
00:42:10,305 --> 00:42:13,448
<i>It may be the way of the confectioner
to blow the nose into the hand</i>

560
00:42:13,568 --> 00:42:16,336
<i>and to wipe it down the suit by accident.</i>

561
00:42:17,248 --> 00:42:20,847
<i>But to take the excretions of
the nose with a handkerchief</i>

562
00:42:20,967 --> 00:42:23,656
<i>by turning away a bit from the other person</i>

563
00:42:23,776 --> 00:42:25,832
<i>is a very decent thing.</i>

564
00:42:26,148 --> 00:42:29,352
<i>And if by accident something
falls to the ground</i>

565
00:42:29,472 --> 00:42:31,943
<i>while blowing the nose with two fingers</i>

566
00:42:32,271 --> 00:42:34,467
<i>then one must step on it immediately.</i>

567
00:42:34,587 --> 00:42:37,928
Yes yes, it's okay, but come now.

568
00:42:39,372 --> 00:42:41,666
Patrizia went to the Fugger,

569
00:42:41,786 --> 00:42:45,563
and Bärbel went to where the
young people still go today.

570
00:42:45,683 --> 00:42:47,594
To the disco in the suburb.

571
00:43:33,516 --> 00:43:37,373
The dances were adapted in
a fine way to the clothes.

572
00:43:41,863 --> 00:43:45,146
It was called 'spinning around'
what they are doing here.

573
00:43:45,266 --> 00:43:49,537
And it was very popular because the
girls wore nothing below the waist.

574
00:43:50,104 --> 00:43:54,158
The 'knocking down' became popular then.

575
00:44:06,195 --> 00:44:07,915
Of course our Bärbel

576
00:44:08,035 --> 00:44:11,001
was participating in the knocking down,

577
00:44:13,058 --> 00:44:16,301
and because of that she was
singing when she came home.

578
00:44:16,895 --> 00:44:20,692
Rosemary and thyme,

579
00:44:20,812 --> 00:44:24,430
is growing in our garden.

580
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:28,100
Maiden Bärbel is the bride.

581
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:32,155
Can't wait any longer.

582
00:44:34,983 --> 00:44:39,196
Can't wait any longer.

583
00:44:39,686 --> 00:44:43,286
Rosemary, thyme, parsley and lavender

584
00:44:43,406 --> 00:44:46,591
were the contraceptives at the time,

585
00:44:47,244 --> 00:44:50,666
and Bärbel was trusting
in this anti-baby soup.

586
00:44:56,813 --> 00:44:58,791
But look there.

587
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:08,423
God bless you.

588
00:45:14,224 --> 00:45:17,289
By the way this invention came from Italy

589
00:45:17,409 --> 00:45:20,513
and also became a blessing in Germany.

590
00:45:23,579 --> 00:45:27,792
The anonymity was a very
gentle touch of this time.

591
00:45:28,572 --> 00:45:32,924
A lot of misery was prevented. For
example in a city like Nuremberg

592
00:45:33,044 --> 00:45:38,560
there was not one child killing in
the more than fertile 15th century.

593
00:45:41,742 --> 00:45:43,838
But the convents

594
00:45:44,234 --> 00:45:47,517
came to resemble giant nurseries.

595
00:45:49,265 --> 00:45:53,063
It seemed as if nature
as a matter of prudence

596
00:45:53,183 --> 00:45:56,202
had already prepared for the next event.

597
00:45:57,582 --> 00:45:59,886
For the Thirty Years' War.

598
00:46:02,097 --> 00:46:04,375
When this apocalypse was over,

599
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:08,502
only 8 million of the former 20
million people lived in Germany.

600
00:46:18,465 --> 00:46:23,111
For all citizens to know: In Nuremberg
the Frankish county council

601
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:28,342
establishes the following law. First,
it is forbidden to admit mankind

602
00:46:28,462 --> 00:46:33,856
under the age of 60 to the monasteries.

603
00:46:34,127 --> 00:46:38,456
Second, it is allowed for priests
and barons if not religious,

604
00:46:38,576 --> 00:46:42,724
or an apprentice, to marry.

605
00:46:43,056 --> 00:46:48,990
Third, it is allowed for every
man to marry two woman.

606
00:46:49,504 --> 00:46:53,045
The naked fear was shining out of this law.

607
00:46:53,165 --> 00:46:57,653
But don't worry, the Germans always
had a special relationship with

608
00:46:57,773 --> 00:47:02,372
national regulations and they
loved and fathered and fathered

609
00:47:02,492 --> 00:47:05,319
and loved as the law ordered.

610
00:47:07,186 --> 00:47:12,329
In 1715, with a chime, the Rococo started.

611
00:47:12,922 --> 00:47:16,403
Like written in Mayers compendium under R.

612
00:47:16,523 --> 00:47:23,345
Ludwig the 15th is the name of the new lord of
not only France but also the demolished Germany.

613
00:47:23,718 --> 00:47:26,527
Our Dior, Knigge,

614
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:28,485
Fanderfelde.

615
00:47:32,302 --> 00:47:37,089
It was a frivolous, a gallant century.

616
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:38,593
Well

617
00:47:39,476 --> 00:47:44,302
Two dozen little Versaille emerged
from Upper Bavaria to Brandenburg

618
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:49,546
and they resembled the Parisian
version as two peas in a pod.

619
00:47:50,634 --> 00:47:55,835
The lords in shining silk
bottoms, silk stockings,

620
00:47:55,955 --> 00:47:59,732
patent-leather shoes with a
petite épée on the side,

621
00:47:59,852 --> 00:48:03,073
and on clean-shaved faces
were powder and rouge.

622
00:48:03,193 --> 00:48:06,119
The women wore atlas shoes,

623
00:48:06,239 --> 00:48:10,273
over them curved the giant crinoline skirt.
An admirer of

624
00:48:10,393 --> 00:48:15,217
lovely shapes invented the baleen
corset and an unknown benefactor

625
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,914
the additional hand.

626
00:48:23,613 --> 00:48:25,927
Can't you control yourself a bit, madam?

627
00:48:26,047 --> 00:48:28,340
My fleas must have bared children.

628
00:48:31,445 --> 00:48:37,201
Alfons, Alfons, Alfons help me. Hurry!

629
00:48:48,493 --> 00:48:54,762
The people had the role of the backstage crew in
this costume operetta. Hardworking and devoted.

630
00:48:56,108 --> 00:49:00,657
Every town girl could
participate in this operetta.

631
00:49:01,171 --> 00:49:04,633
Beauty opens all doors.

632
00:49:13,841 --> 00:49:17,045
Oh my beloved Franzi.

633
00:49:17,598 --> 00:49:21,178
Bib of cold hearts. Tinder of love.

634
00:49:21,495 --> 00:49:23,532
Golden box of ornament.

635
00:49:24,521 --> 00:49:26,341
Foot pump of sighs.

636
00:49:27,474 --> 00:49:29,412
Blotting paper of grief.

637
00:49:30,124 --> 00:49:31,963
Sandbox of my palm

638
00:49:32,497 --> 00:49:34,495
and wood oil of my pain.

639
00:49:35,207 --> 00:49:37,561
What a beautiful rhyme of yours.

640
00:49:39,233 --> 00:49:40,400
Franzi.

641
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:43,723
Franzi is not very prudish but strict.

642
00:49:44,415 --> 00:49:46,828
Like many women of her
time she was a kind of

643
00:49:46,948 --> 00:49:50,994
half-virgin who mustn't fear
the examination of a doctor.

644
00:49:51,350 --> 00:49:54,435
A precursor of petting so to say.

645
00:49:54,555 --> 00:49:57,356
- I don't like you going into the bower.
- Oh, mother.

646
00:49:57,476 --> 00:49:59,770
- Not with this hairdresser's assistant.
- He's harmless.

647
00:49:59,790 --> 00:50:01,501
Remember the Pompadure, the Tüberin

648
00:50:01,621 --> 00:50:04,636
... like in Stuttgart. I
will always remember that.

649
00:50:04,756 --> 00:50:06,945
And also our baroness. What was she?

650
00:50:07,065 --> 00:50:08,438
- Daughter of a baker.
- You see.

651
00:50:08,458 --> 00:50:11,472
Well, I won't put you to shame
if the baron invites me.

652
00:50:11,592 --> 00:50:16,459
To become a baroness... for this intention
every principle could be dropped.

653
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:22,666
By the way this was the
morning toilet of the baron.

654
00:50:23,717 --> 00:50:25,869
Bathing was long forgotten.

655
00:50:26,831 --> 00:50:28,615
The finger tips were washed.

656
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:31,387
The rest was powdered and perfumed

657
00:50:32,032 --> 00:50:35,336
and graciously covered with piled up wigs.

658
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:42,538
What are you doing Alfons? Ouch!

659
00:50:42,658 --> 00:50:44,880
- What is it?
- Just a few lice, baron.

660
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,272
Take the lavender and numb them a bit.

661
00:50:47,855 --> 00:50:49,957
Is madam coming for dinner?

662
00:50:50,413 --> 00:50:52,564
Or is she with her lover?

663
00:50:52,684 --> 00:50:55,235
The baroness already ordered a raw egg.

664
00:50:55,355 --> 00:50:57,387
Ugh! So the marquis is still with her.

665
00:50:57,507 --> 00:50:59,248
It's not the Frenchman.

666
00:50:59,368 --> 00:51:00,729
Maybe the Spaniard.

667
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:02,554
No, it's monseigneur Hunzinger.

668
00:51:02,674 --> 00:51:05,248
Oh that awful organist.

669
00:51:05,784 --> 00:51:07,769
Recently I watched them secretly.

670
00:51:07,889 --> 00:51:09,971
I don't know what she sees in him.

671
00:51:10,194 --> 00:51:13,647
It is said that he is extremely perverse.

672
00:51:14,194 --> 00:51:16,240
Speaking of perverse. What's new?

673
00:51:18,594 --> 00:51:22,250
The landgrave of Hesse sold
5000 soldiers to America.

674
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:23,374
That Nujon.

675
00:51:25,045 --> 00:51:28,660
The duchess of Mecklenburg let
herself be raped by the Tsar Peter.

676
00:51:28,934 --> 00:51:30,361
Yuck! Yuck! Yuck!

677
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:33,507
The duke was allowed to watch.

678
00:51:33,627 --> 00:51:35,086
Lovely.

679
00:51:37,405 --> 00:51:39,501
Augustus the Strong married.

680
00:51:39,770 --> 00:51:41,309
Who is with him now?

681
00:51:41,429 --> 00:51:42,798
His own daughter.

682
00:51:43,193 --> 00:51:44,914
The world is unimaginative.

683
00:51:44,934 --> 00:51:49,199
But this here is the newest
from the Marquis de Sade.

684
00:51:49,419 --> 00:51:50,907
They talk about him.

685
00:51:54,476 --> 00:51:56,274
This is heavier than the Bible.

686
00:51:56,394 --> 00:51:58,637
I marked the special places.

687
00:52:11,126 --> 00:52:13,784
- Which costume, monsieur?
- The deep blue one.

688
00:52:14,582 --> 00:52:15,670
Blu Moir.

689
00:52:16,296 --> 00:52:19,549
All dirt green or flea belly blue.

690
00:52:20,106 --> 00:52:21,549
Oh, madame.

691
00:52:26,295 --> 00:52:27,890
You look tired,

692
00:52:28,269 --> 00:52:30,890
but not less lovely.

693
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:34,445
Which was perhaps down to the fact
that the nights are getting shorter.

694
00:52:34,465 --> 00:52:38,299
Too bad that you are tired today.
I wanted to invite you to a pastoral.

695
00:52:38,419 --> 00:52:40,881
Alfons, the pinch. For you to liven up.

696
00:52:47,737 --> 00:52:51,231
Snuffing is a real child of the Rococo.

697
00:53:06,204 --> 00:53:10,191
There was an almost unbelievable coquetry,

698
00:53:10,311 --> 00:53:13,470
gallantry, and dimunition of life.

699
00:53:13,989 --> 00:53:18,371
Everything and everyone was
prepared for an everlasting feast.

700
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,139
Great.

701
00:53:35,343 --> 00:53:37,217
Real great.

702
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,081
Monsieur.

703
00:53:41,537 --> 00:53:44,840
If you keep on drinking so much
you won't make a sting tonight.

704
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:48,094
Don't worry, madame. As always I will
report to you in detail afterwards.

705
00:53:48,773 --> 00:53:50,558
This would be something new.

706
00:53:50,678 --> 00:53:52,406
Normally I'm the one who's reporting.

707
00:53:53,950 --> 00:53:57,381
Alfons, when everyone is
sitting later, then...

708
00:53:57,501 --> 00:53:58,938
I know. The water.

709
00:53:59,058 --> 00:54:01,755
And after the water...

710
00:54:07,097 --> 00:54:08,603
Bye for now,

711
00:54:09,656 --> 00:54:10,745
my child.

712
00:54:17,618 --> 00:54:19,200
What's with them?

713
00:54:19,521 --> 00:54:22,243
The duke of Bistron and his wife.

714
00:54:22,661 --> 00:54:24,825
- And the mistress?
- Discarded.

715
00:54:25,154 --> 00:54:26,445
Why? Is he ruined?

716
00:54:26,565 --> 00:54:28,218
No, impotent.

717
00:54:28,338 --> 00:54:29,977
So what is his wife doing with him?

718
00:54:30,097 --> 00:54:31,150
She's faithful to him.

719
00:54:31,270 --> 00:54:35,301
How depressing, speaking of...
the chair. Fast!

720
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:39,631
The fact that there were
bathrooms in Germany

721
00:54:39,751 --> 00:54:43,235
was forgotten by the architects. Portable

722
00:54:43,355 --> 00:54:47,906
devices were used and servants
were toting such seats after

723
00:54:48,026 --> 00:54:52,139
their masters from hall to hall. For
example, Listelotte Palatinate reported

724
00:54:52,259 --> 00:54:56,918
that the Dofaun preferred to
dine in his shitting chair.

725
00:55:39,532 --> 00:55:40,976
The skirt.

726
00:55:44,398 --> 00:55:45,545
Higher.

727
00:55:47,958 --> 00:55:49,125
Still higher.

728
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:54,478
Great.

729
00:56:10,401 --> 00:56:11,587
The skirt.

730
00:56:13,783 --> 00:56:17,106
Lift it up. The whole skirt.

731
00:56:27,433 --> 00:56:33,505
Well, loving was short, nervous,
and often without success.

732
00:56:34,494 --> 00:56:40,012
But even in a sober state the act
of love had an almost cute brevity.

733
00:56:56,495 --> 00:56:58,136
Already finished?

734
00:56:58,532 --> 00:57:01,182
He hasn't even started. He's...

735
00:57:01,302 --> 00:57:05,335
drunk. Oh you sweet little lamb. What now?

736
00:57:08,164 --> 00:57:11,170
Come, put down your dress.

737
00:57:13,997 --> 00:57:15,440
Come to me.

738
00:57:16,449 --> 00:57:18,051
Come on.

739
00:57:18,171 --> 00:57:22,145
Sex education was in the Age
of Enlightenment a big topic.

740
00:57:22,265 --> 00:57:26,022
There were no magazines, but stage plays.

741
00:57:26,142 --> 00:57:30,021
One of them was Millo's School of Women,
which was meaningfully also called

742
00:57:30,141 --> 00:57:34,028
Ladies' Philosophy, and it included almost
everything a young girl needed to know.

743
00:57:34,148 --> 00:57:35,274
A sample?

744
00:57:35,394 --> 00:57:36,442
Get in.

745
00:57:36,462 --> 00:57:38,577
Well, please.

746
00:57:40,606 --> 00:57:42,525
Are you still a virgin?

747
00:57:43,791 --> 00:57:48,399
This can be fixed. Maybe if our
friend becomes conscious again.

748
00:57:48,519 --> 00:57:50,436
Oh, is he also drunk?

749
00:57:50,556 --> 00:57:55,020
No, no, he always faints afterwards.
Come nearer.

750
00:57:56,719 --> 00:57:57,728
Tell me

751
00:57:58,519 --> 00:58:00,695
what do you know about love?

752
00:58:00,991 --> 00:58:03,938
Oh, I have to excuse myself
for being so inexperienced.

753
00:58:04,058 --> 00:58:06,767
So you don't know what a man is doing
with you if he wants to do it?

754
00:58:06,887 --> 00:58:09,160
Well, I have a faint idea.

755
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:11,553
I will tell you. What do you want to know?

756
00:58:11,673 --> 00:58:13,725
What is a man doing if he comes near you?

757
00:58:13,845 --> 00:58:15,893
Well, it depends.

758
00:58:16,013 --> 00:58:20,640
For example, he lies lengthwise next to me

759
00:58:22,184 --> 00:58:26,219
and touches my nipples.

760
00:58:26,339 --> 00:58:30,906
I notice how aroused he becomes and
he says, "Honey, I must sleep now."

761
00:58:31,026 --> 00:58:35,693
But he puts a hand on my body.
If the shirt prevents him

762
00:58:35,813 --> 00:58:37,097
he lifts it up.

763
00:58:37,810 --> 00:58:41,192
Sometimes he touches my butt cheeks and...

764
00:58:42,181 --> 00:58:44,040
Yes, I know.

765
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:47,756
Then he removes the sheet and
the blanket to look at me.

766
00:58:48,052 --> 00:58:54,468
With a candle in his hand he looks
closely at me everywhere. Finally...

767
00:58:54,988 --> 00:59:00,256
To love was no longer need but fashion.

768
00:59:01,277 --> 00:59:04,916
It was courteous, social prestige.

769
00:59:06,049 --> 00:59:08,778
A secret love was useless.

770
00:59:10,301 --> 00:59:13,149
...calls me his one and only...

771
00:59:13,269 --> 00:59:16,274
The emblem of manhood
also lost of importance

772
00:59:16,394 --> 00:59:19,340
and so did the geometric
center of the female body.

773
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:22,758
Eyes, breast, mouth, hands.

774
00:59:22,878 --> 00:59:27,861
The attention and talk
was focused on these.

775
00:59:28,454 --> 00:59:31,520
I leave it up to you to think about it.

776
00:59:40,733 --> 00:59:43,344
Sometimes when he is in a hurry...

777
00:59:45,618 --> 00:59:49,060
This is always a special pleasure.
Do you understand?

778
01:00:01,274 --> 01:00:06,416
I'm disgusted of this century! The
high spark of light is burned down!

779
01:00:06,536 --> 01:00:11,733
Instead there is fake fire which
doesn't light one pipe of tobacco.

780
01:00:11,853 --> 01:00:16,025
There they are crawling
on the club of Hercules

781
01:00:16,145 --> 01:00:20,811
and studying what this thing is
that leads to his testicles.

782
01:00:20,931 --> 01:00:25,230
A hectic professor puts a vial of
ammonia solution under the nose

783
01:00:25,350 --> 01:00:28,178
and reads a council about power.

784
01:00:28,298 --> 01:00:32,719
Heart faints when a boy is born.

785
01:00:32,839 --> 01:00:38,969
Yuck, yuck for this century of eunuchs.

786
01:00:39,089 --> 01:00:44,586
Put me in front of an army of guys like
myself and Germany shall become a republic

787
01:00:44,706 --> 01:00:49,347
which make Rome and Sparta
look like a convent.

788
01:00:56,724 --> 01:01:01,669
Schiller wrote this in 1787,

789
01:01:01,789 --> 01:01:06,039
and it didn't take long until the courtly
society broke through the fragile

790
01:01:06,159 --> 01:01:12,546
wormy floor and right onto the
bayonets of the mob in France.

791
01:01:12,666 --> 01:01:18,945
We in Germany did it differently. We
took off our wigs and wrote each other

792
01:01:19,065 --> 01:01:22,248
certificates that one was never involved.

793
01:01:22,806 --> 01:01:28,913
We also had no bayonets, but
a stable civil mental basis.

794
01:01:29,358 --> 01:01:34,376
Without any bloody stopovers Germany
slided into the hearty century.

795
01:01:34,496 --> 01:01:35,835
Biedermeier.

796
01:01:36,255 --> 01:01:40,656
Germany: A Winter's Tale was it
melancholily called by Heine.

797
01:01:40,776 --> 01:01:46,622
Because for him it was completely
incomprehensible how such strong impulses and

798
01:01:46,742 --> 01:01:51,023
such great flights of ideas could be improved
so much by the revolutionary Schiller.

799
01:01:52,024 --> 01:01:56,079
Fine, instead one was hearty, coy,

800
01:01:56,199 --> 01:01:59,219
one was moved to tears.

801
01:01:59,339 --> 01:02:03,644
And yes, they were of value again
and everyone who was wearing them

802
01:02:03,764 --> 01:02:07,650
could be described: <i>He's no longer
a human of the cynical Rococo.</i>

803
01:02:07,770 --> 01:02:09,974
The Rococo never cried.

804
01:02:12,812 --> 01:02:18,870
The only nude in this buttoned up time
was sitting and freezing on a rock.

805
01:02:19,216 --> 01:02:27,053
<i>I don't know what it's supposed to mean</i>

806
01:02:27,173 --> 01:02:31,652
<i>that I'm so sad.</i>

807
01:02:31,772 --> 01:02:34,231
But we know, madam.

808
01:02:34,552 --> 01:02:39,052
Because of the bedroom, the beds
were really for sleeping only.

809
01:02:39,373 --> 01:02:44,021
But it must be given credit that this
century was intellectually more active.

810
01:02:44,541 --> 01:02:48,200
Invented was photography,

811
01:02:49,658 --> 01:02:51,587
the steam train,

812
01:02:52,452 --> 01:02:53,826
the car,

813
01:02:53,946 --> 01:02:56,422
the penny farthing, the airplane,

814
01:02:56,917 --> 01:02:59,043
the Olympic games,

815
01:02:59,611 --> 01:03:02,751
human dignity, the proletariat,

816
01:03:02,871 --> 01:03:04,927
and finally ourselves.

817
01:03:05,047 --> 01:03:10,416
A century of hardworking men, a
century of misunderstood women,

818
01:03:10,536 --> 01:03:14,223
and a century of the beating
hearts of young girls.

819
01:03:14,684 --> 01:03:20,395
Our great grandmother is 18 years old,
is now called Elisabeth Charlotte

820
01:03:20,515 --> 01:03:22,843
and is experiencing her first ball.

821
01:03:22,963 --> 01:03:26,576
Oh father, I can't tell you how
beautiful the world is for me.

822
01:03:27,046 --> 01:03:27,912
No, no.

823
01:03:27,932 --> 01:03:31,274
I thank you for such kindness, father.
I'm very excited.

824
01:03:31,394 --> 01:03:33,128
It doesn't show.

825
01:03:33,248 --> 01:03:36,073
I know, but I'm a weak
girl who never wants to

826
01:03:36,193 --> 01:03:39,510
part with you and mother. I'm
saying this today, because...

827
01:03:39,630 --> 01:03:42,204
...that step will come soon.

828
01:03:42,324 --> 01:03:47,525
Of course, this is the law of nature. One day
you will meet the man you will belong to.

829
01:03:47,645 --> 01:03:49,693
A cruel word, father.

830
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:54,606
Henriette, I hope you spoke with
Elisabeth about certain intimate things.

831
01:03:54,726 --> 01:03:58,366
Mother did, but I think all
of this is very terrible.

832
01:03:58,606 --> 01:04:00,024
With a man, when he...

833
01:04:00,144 --> 01:04:04,543
Enough child, you don't need to say it.
It's not terrible at all.

834
01:04:05,215 --> 01:04:09,164
I think mother and I gave
you an opposite example.

835
01:04:09,284 --> 01:04:10,658
It's the fulfillment.

836
01:04:10,778 --> 01:04:15,189
These are things, Elisabeth, of
which you shouldn't explore.

837
01:04:15,309 --> 01:04:18,898
The principle and the
detail, and you should

838
01:04:19,018 --> 01:04:21,100
only guess the emotional side.

839
01:04:21,220 --> 01:04:26,176
One can't know in life how a marriage
proceeds, same with a conversation.

840
01:04:26,296 --> 01:04:31,215
A conversation can't go wrong
if it is done properly with

841
01:04:31,335 --> 01:04:34,810
sympathy, tactfulness,
discretion and politeness.

842
01:04:35,333 --> 01:04:38,840
By the way who is that young man
over there, talking to our Fontane?

843
01:04:40,055 --> 01:04:43,308
I'm very grateful to you, please excuse me.

844
01:04:49,350 --> 01:04:51,920
May I ask for this dance? Thanks.

845
01:05:01,220 --> 01:05:04,561
I'm very grateful to Mr.
Fontane for my invitation.

846
01:05:06,816 --> 01:05:10,069
So I can take part in another of
these popular private dances,

847
01:05:10,189 --> 01:05:11,980
before I go back home to Danzig.

848
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:15,056
Oh, you are at home in our
beautiful amber casket.

849
01:05:15,176 --> 01:05:16,461
Why amber?

850
01:05:16,581 --> 01:05:18,559
The amber coast is not far from Danzig.

851
01:05:18,679 --> 01:05:22,065
Really? Well, I don't like
amber, but I love Danzig.

852
01:05:22,185 --> 01:05:24,191
- How nice, do you know it well?
- No, not at all.

853
01:05:24,211 --> 01:05:27,711
So tell me please. How can you
love something you don't know?

854
01:05:27,831 --> 01:05:30,669
Why not? Please excuse me.

855
01:05:31,033 --> 01:05:32,885
I just wanted to make your day.

856
01:05:33,005 --> 01:05:35,843
- I think you're very much in love.
- I'm just a little confused.

857
01:05:35,963 --> 01:05:39,754
My father used to say, that a
conversation like a marriage needs

858
01:05:39,874 --> 01:05:42,127
to be done in a polite and clear manner.

859
01:05:42,247 --> 01:05:44,295
- You love your father very much.
- I admire him.

860
01:05:44,415 --> 01:05:48,375
And you can talk about such things.
About love, marriage, eroticism.

861
01:05:48,495 --> 01:05:49,831
Oh, not at all.

862
01:05:49,951 --> 01:05:54,324
I just thought that some things are common
here, which are impossible at our place.

863
01:05:54,609 --> 01:05:56,191
What do you think of us?

864
01:05:56,764 --> 01:06:00,198
I wanted to know how it
looks inside the head of

865
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:04,328
such a protected, lovely
lady concerning this topic.

866
01:06:05,372 --> 01:06:08,378
Blurry. Look how honest I am.
Is it awful?

867
01:06:08,498 --> 01:06:11,964
It's beautiful. I mean being
honest without losing charm.

868
01:06:12,771 --> 01:06:15,777
Do you think I can pay your
mother a courtesy visit?

869
01:06:15,897 --> 01:06:18,420
Ask her. She's next to Mr. Fontane.

870
01:06:19,053 --> 01:06:21,125
She will ask him for a signal.

871
01:06:21,245 --> 01:06:24,274
Of course, one needs to
be reasonable, right?

872
01:06:28,441 --> 01:06:31,969
Madame, sometimes I wish I were an actor.

873
01:06:32,586 --> 01:06:36,700
Then I could do whatever I want
and couldn't lose my face.

874
01:06:37,321 --> 01:06:38,339
Do you understand?

875
01:06:38,359 --> 01:06:42,843
I'd love to say yes, but I'm afraid
this would be most harmless.

876
01:06:43,192 --> 01:06:45,549
I may never become an actor.

877
01:06:45,669 --> 01:06:48,904
I admire the volte,
especially the volte scream.

878
01:06:49,024 --> 01:06:51,569
Oh please, whoever screams like that?

879
01:06:51,689 --> 01:06:54,219
Brings screaming more luck than silence.

880
01:06:54,339 --> 01:06:57,720
The people from the theatre are
visibly more happy than we are.

881
01:06:57,840 --> 01:06:59,639
They love more than we do.

882
01:06:59,759 --> 01:07:02,269
There's not the slightest proof of this.

883
01:07:02,389 --> 01:07:07,446
To love somebody dearly and full of
trust and admiration is stronger

884
01:07:07,566 --> 01:07:13,241
than fighting twice every year over another
man and behaving in a shameless manner.

885
01:07:13,361 --> 01:07:16,445
Dearest, lovely Elisabeth Charlotte,

886
01:07:16,999 --> 01:07:19,115
do you even know what love is?

887
01:07:19,235 --> 01:07:21,271
I can't know more than this.

888
01:07:21,391 --> 01:07:24,843
For me love is connected with
purpose and not with desire.

889
01:07:24,963 --> 01:07:28,463
Since I have the desire to
love, I'll get around to love.

890
01:07:29,036 --> 01:07:32,517
My father would never allow
me to marry an unworthy man.

891
01:07:32,637 --> 01:07:36,196
This sounds as if you expect
love as a result of marriage.

892
01:07:37,076 --> 01:07:40,339
But you must love the man
before you get engaged, right?

893
01:07:41,091 --> 01:07:44,848
Am I talking to a modern and daring woman
when I tell you that you must desire him

894
01:07:44,968 --> 01:07:49,448
before you respect him as your
husband and bread-earner.

895
01:07:49,568 --> 01:07:52,544
Do you understand? Desire with the senses.

896
01:07:52,664 --> 01:07:57,860
I know this word is not in the books. You
men keep it on your lips and wish it.

897
01:07:58,626 --> 01:08:01,445
Well, then take care that it happens.

898
01:08:04,510 --> 01:08:07,255
Oh God, what are we talking about?

899
01:08:07,375 --> 01:08:11,433
I didn't desire my father
and yet I love him now.

900
01:08:11,803 --> 01:08:14,003
Is it foolish what I said?

901
01:08:14,646 --> 01:08:16,896
Let us girls have our dreams.

902
01:08:17,016 --> 01:08:19,442
We promise to want to love.

903
01:08:19,887 --> 01:08:22,409
I want many children.

904
01:08:23,846 --> 01:08:26,442
Shall we go to the buffet?

905
01:08:27,925 --> 01:08:31,139
I always get very hungry when I'm excited.

906
01:08:31,259 --> 01:08:32,282
Are you?

907
01:08:32,302 --> 01:08:35,144
Yes, but I don't want it to be noticed.
Do you notice it?

908
01:08:35,264 --> 01:08:37,308
Not at all. You look lovely.

909
01:08:37,428 --> 01:08:40,317
How nice, that you're not one of
these hypermodern emancipated women.

910
01:08:40,437 --> 01:08:44,568
What? Ah, I understand, these are
the women who wear a graduation cap

911
01:08:44,688 --> 01:08:48,494
instead of all the four children, right?
What do these women want?

912
01:08:48,853 --> 01:08:50,113
To be equal.

913
01:08:50,379 --> 01:08:51,438
In what?

914
01:08:51,467 --> 01:08:53,784
- In occupation, in work.
- How strange.

915
01:08:54,189 --> 01:08:57,100
Then these women wish to be
in the same situation like

916
01:08:57,220 --> 01:09:00,089
the poor, poor working women.

917
01:09:00,469 --> 01:09:03,855
How brilliant, but the
emancipated woman also wants

918
01:09:03,975 --> 01:09:06,972
the total equal rights relating to respect.

919
01:09:07,092 --> 01:09:08,875
I don't understand this at all.

920
01:09:08,995 --> 01:09:12,811
So far I had the feeling that more
respect was shown to women than men.

921
01:09:12,931 --> 01:09:16,015
There must be something wrong.
Oh, I'll leave this

922
01:09:16,135 --> 01:09:19,080
to the men. I'm really a weak girl.

923
01:09:20,504 --> 01:09:23,036
Try one of these buns. They're good.

924
01:09:23,156 --> 01:09:27,578
No, thanks. I'm satisfied. I don't
want to get an "enfant bedaine".

925
01:09:27,698 --> 01:09:30,372
But such a paunch looks very noble.

926
01:09:30,492 --> 01:09:34,377
That really is strange enough. Let
there be corpulent men around me.

927
01:09:34,497 --> 01:09:36,528
They're easier to handle.

928
01:09:36,648 --> 01:09:40,138
There's nothing more beautiful
than a handsome man.

929
01:09:40,583 --> 01:09:42,190
I row a lot.

930
01:09:42,310 --> 01:09:45,651
Oh, you must be strong.

931
01:09:45,771 --> 01:09:48,760
Well, but where to put this strength?

932
01:09:49,230 --> 01:09:53,161
With so much honourable
captivity valves were needed.

933
01:09:53,281 --> 01:09:57,784
So for the men the stag party
and men's joke were invented.

934
01:09:58,798 --> 01:10:02,951
At the regulars' table
it got dirty like hell.

935
01:10:03,071 --> 01:10:07,343
"Strange, he's also not outside," she said
to Witz, "Better we turn on the light."

936
01:10:18,067 --> 01:10:21,398
- You shall sleep.
- I can't.

937
01:10:21,518 --> 01:10:26,318
At home in the illuminated bedroom
one tried to keep one's composure.

938
01:10:26,438 --> 01:10:28,513
One went also with composure to bed.

939
01:10:28,633 --> 01:10:33,297
There a woman was waiting not daring to
say she doesn't care about composure.

940
01:10:33,417 --> 01:10:36,109
That's why she felt misunderstood.

941
01:10:36,229 --> 01:10:39,880
The stork brought all the many,
nice children of this era.

942
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,703
One had to do it.

943
01:10:41,823 --> 01:10:45,010
- Karl Heinrich?
- Yes my dear?

944
01:10:45,875 --> 01:10:49,275
What is an orgy?

945
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:54,281
An orgy...?

946
01:10:58,354 --> 01:11:02,124
- Elisabeth, please.
- Sorry.

947
01:11:12,446 --> 01:11:15,290
Karl, please. The orgy.

948
01:11:24,086 --> 01:11:26,373
An orgy...

949
01:11:26,493 --> 01:11:28,784
That's...

950
01:11:28,904 --> 01:11:35,120
...a big dirtiness, gentlemen. I
call upon your officer's honor.

951
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:37,097
Lieutenant Jennewein.

952
01:11:38,055 --> 01:11:42,289
Do you confess to having a orgy

953
01:11:42,877 --> 01:11:44,723
with this Sophie Lurmann?

954
01:11:44,843 --> 01:11:46,763
- I confess.
- I confess.

955
01:11:46,883 --> 01:11:48,246
I confess everything.

956
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:51,367
Sophie Lurmann.

957
01:11:55,107 --> 01:12:01,412
Is it proved, that you... with
the lieutenants... I mean

958
01:12:01,813 --> 01:12:03,915
Of course you know what I mean.

959
01:12:04,935 --> 01:12:10,436
I confess indecent acts with
these lieutenants letting...

960
01:12:11,145 --> 01:12:12,628
being...

961
01:12:13,370 --> 01:12:14,513
happened.

962
01:12:15,873 --> 01:12:19,860
Yes, so in the name of the Emperor

963
01:12:20,632 --> 01:12:24,743
the district court convicts
the responsible editor

964
01:12:24,863 --> 01:12:31,357
for reporting about the moral misconduct
of the accused in the Bauzner newspaper,

965
01:12:31,477 --> 01:12:37,228
for utterances which insult the public
moral feeling to six months in prison.

966
01:12:37,623 --> 01:12:39,292
That's strange.

967
01:12:39,412 --> 01:12:44,268
The protagonists were discharged
and the editors were punished.

968
01:12:45,349 --> 01:12:49,522
My dear Elisabeth Charlotte.
For the judge it made sense

969
01:12:49,642 --> 01:12:53,539
to protect the citizens, which want
to stay unspoilt and pristine,

970
01:12:53,659 --> 01:12:57,248
from the violent touch of these things.

971
01:12:58,731 --> 01:13:00,462
I don't understand this.

972
01:13:02,302 --> 01:13:05,393
You will learn to understand, my child.

973
01:13:06,207 --> 01:13:09,424
Such a state of mind is the only protection

974
01:13:09,544 --> 01:13:12,595
against the imminent catastrophe.

975
01:13:22,352 --> 01:13:24,706
It couldn't be stopped.

976
01:13:25,124 --> 01:13:29,469
When the walls were breaking in 1918, it
flowed from the inside to the outside.

977
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:34,228
The so-far modest Germany had
a lot of catching-up to do

978
01:13:34,348 --> 01:13:36,393
Politically and erotically.

979
01:13:36,755 --> 01:13:41,292
One was prudish to excess. Now the
pendulum swings to the other side.

980
01:13:51,339 --> 01:13:56,542
This new era seemed to tumble
over, reeling of freedom.

981
01:13:56,662 --> 01:13:59,633
In the cinema one could see
things never seen before.

982
01:13:59,753 --> 01:14:02,948
Eroticism became an industry.

983
01:14:12,349 --> 01:14:15,083
Every evening the prices were written

984
01:14:15,203 --> 01:14:19,014
like stock lists at the Berlin zoo.

985
01:14:19,346 --> 01:14:23,840
Prices claimed in detail
by boys and school girls.

986
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:28,476
The sexual life of the children was
eagerly discussed in all newspapers

987
01:14:29,105 --> 01:14:31,304
and in the hospitals.

988
01:14:37,554 --> 01:14:39,738
One was nicro-erotic.

989
01:14:39,858 --> 01:14:43,257
Pale, dark-rimmed like a sympathy card.

990
01:14:43,688 --> 01:14:48,371
Only the negative was worth experiencing,
only the sick was interesting.

991
01:14:48,491 --> 01:14:52,958
No-hopers were smoking cigarettes
with tongue-wet filters.

992
01:14:53,078 --> 01:14:59,123
Tired, exhausted ladies smoked mysterious,
dangerous cigarettes out of long black holders.

993
01:14:59,243 --> 01:15:02,709
Transvestites were also sometimes smoking.

994
01:15:03,608 --> 01:15:05,962
<i>No one finds the way here.</i>

995
01:15:06,082 --> 01:15:08,836
<i>The real are false, the false are real.</i>

996
01:15:08,956 --> 01:15:11,041
<i>Sleep with yourself, I don't care.</i>

997
01:15:11,161 --> 01:15:15,421
<i>And sleep with thistle, finch, and
starling and Brems' whole flock of birds.</i>

998
01:15:15,541 --> 01:15:19,661
<i>It's all one to me.</i>  Signed Erich Kästner.

999
01:15:21,377 --> 01:15:23,934
<i>A man that appeals to me</i>

1000
01:15:24,054 --> 01:15:29,327
<i>must be the most stupid, must be
the most retarded, must be the</i>

1001
01:15:29,613 --> 01:15:32,347
<i>most stupid of the world,
and if I have this man</i>

1002
01:15:32,467 --> 01:15:37,676
<i>and if I have this man then I won't
even look at him at daylight.</i>

1003
01:15:37,796 --> 01:15:43,829
<i>Don't you know something new for me,
something crazy, really perverse.</i>

1004
01:15:43,949 --> 01:15:48,861
Don't you know something new for me,
something crazy, really perverse.

1005
01:15:48,981 --> 01:15:52,051
Sung by Hilde Hildebrand.
At the end of the twenties

1006
01:15:52,171 --> 01:15:54,670
one started to laugh about the twenties.

1007
01:15:54,790 --> 01:15:58,519
Don't you have anything new for me?
Do we really need something?

1008
01:15:59,126 --> 01:16:02,392
Well, history gave Adolf Hitler to us.

1009
01:16:02,512 --> 01:16:05,741
And he knew something new
for the German damsel.

1010
01:16:05,861 --> 01:16:09,577
Something crazy, really perverse.
He let them be examined.

1011
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:41,738
<i>Marriage is no longer self-purpose.</i>

1012
01:16:42,152 --> 01:16:47,506
<i>It shall only serve the great goal of reproducing
and conserving the species and race.</i>

1013
01:16:47,886 --> 01:16:52,747
<i>It's in the interest of the nation,
that the most beautiful bodies must</i>

1014
01:16:52,867 --> 01:16:55,278
<i>help give new beauty to the people.</i>

1015
01:17:23,722 --> 01:17:28,836
<i>Not in the honorable philistine or in the
virtuous old maid does the ideal exist,</i>

1016
01:17:28,956 --> 01:17:33,886
<i>but in the defiant embodiment of
male strength and in women who</i>

1017
01:17:34,006 --> 01:17:36,279
<i>give birth to men.</i>

1018
01:18:04,997 --> 01:18:10,199
It took only 1000 years. The
prolific, down-to-earth,

1019
01:18:10,319 --> 01:18:14,687
racial high-value heroin with
the holy water-colored eyes

1020
01:18:14,807 --> 01:18:18,623
served Germany as "Trümmerfrau".
Awful, isn't it?

1021
01:18:19,177 --> 01:18:22,361
But like plucked chickens
they emerged out of the ashes

1022
01:18:22,481 --> 01:18:24,588
and started a new era.

1023
01:18:24,708 --> 01:18:29,750
The era of wonders. The first
wonder was to survive.

1024
01:18:30,205 --> 01:18:31,985
Good night, Anton.

1025
01:18:34,220 --> 01:18:36,930
The second wonder was the economic miracle.

1026
01:18:37,050 --> 01:18:40,187
In the meantime one became a
democrat, had read his Brecht

1027
01:18:40,307 --> 01:18:44,004
and lived according to the
doctrine: first the food.

1028
01:18:44,976 --> 01:18:49,624
Rings were no longer under
the eyes, but on the finger.

1029
01:18:55,291 --> 01:18:56,972
Good night, Anton.

1030
01:18:57,092 --> 01:19:00,137
Good night Emma. 32, 34...

1031
01:19:05,671 --> 01:19:08,183
One day they woke up,

1032
01:19:08,303 --> 01:19:11,505
they sent the milk and
newest comic strips into

1033
01:19:11,625 --> 01:19:14,136
the children's room, but it was locked.

1034
01:19:14,256 --> 01:19:16,430
Yes, all the shaking was no good.

1035
01:19:16,550 --> 01:19:18,675
It stayed closed.

1036
01:19:35,512 --> 01:19:38,816
And the surprised parents from
the efficient, hard-working,

1037
01:19:38,936 --> 01:19:42,829
and busy generation witnessed
their third wonder.

1038
01:19:44,004 --> 01:19:45,853
The wonder of love.

1039
01:19:48,511 --> 01:19:51,460
They didn't experience it themselves

1040
01:19:51,580 --> 01:19:54,106
but through their own flesh and blood.

1041
01:19:54,346 --> 01:19:55,979
The youth were loving.

1042
01:19:56,511 --> 01:19:58,042
Look there.

1043
01:19:58,726 --> 01:20:02,954
Somehow on their own they
discovered sexuality.

1044
01:20:05,498 --> 01:20:08,030
The amazement of the adults was enormous.

1045
01:20:08,638 --> 01:20:10,815
Sex? What is that?

1046
01:20:12,802 --> 01:20:13,825
Eva,

1047
01:20:14,223 --> 01:20:16,375
can you bring me a scissor?

1048
01:20:16,495 --> 01:20:19,514
One doesn't need to ask long.
We got it fresh.

1049
01:20:19,634 --> 01:20:23,450
Fresh everywhere. The wonder
of sex education from the knee

1050
01:20:23,570 --> 01:20:27,793
up to the adrenal. The helpers were ready,

1051
01:20:27,913 --> 01:20:31,641
and where there had been cooking recipes
and paper patterns now something

1052
01:20:31,761 --> 01:20:35,565
new was there. Sexual awareness-raising.

1053
01:20:35,685 --> 01:20:38,742
Sexual grammar for the erotic
students of a second-rate school.

1054
01:20:38,862 --> 01:20:42,363
And in wonderment one was told that
one knew almost nothing of love.

1055
01:20:42,483 --> 01:20:47,211
This had to be caught up.

1056
01:20:47,717 --> 01:20:51,603
One was always there. The
recipe Casanova, the invisible

1057
01:20:51,723 --> 01:20:57,435
whisperer with the sexual handbook
and the hands-on mentality. Take...

1058
01:20:58,866 --> 01:21:03,511
You should be ready for a possible
sexual encounter every evening.

1059
01:21:04,161 --> 01:21:07,287
Take a bath and most of all

1060
01:21:07,407 --> 01:21:10,718
never show yourself to
your partner with curlers.

1061
01:21:20,351 --> 01:21:23,503
Don't forget the daily smell killer.

1062
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:29,538
And adjust the scents carefully on another.

1063
01:21:35,894 --> 01:21:41,881
Swallow Beate Uhse...I mean candy in fact

1064
01:21:43,996 --> 01:21:47,401
half and hour before the
possible intercourse

1065
01:21:49,806 --> 01:21:50,945
and then

1066
01:21:51,401 --> 01:21:53,895
we try a headstand.

1067
01:21:54,461 --> 01:21:55,866
About 10 minutes.

1068
01:21:56,461 --> 01:21:59,917
It stimulates the blood flow
in the whole gland system.

1069
01:22:14,677 --> 01:22:16,639
Tell me, did you take a pill?

1070
01:22:16,759 --> 01:22:19,106
Yes, yes, one takes it half an hour before.

1071
01:22:19,435 --> 01:22:21,359
How long for the headstand?

1072
01:22:21,479 --> 01:22:23,372
10 minutes, like required.

1073
01:22:23,492 --> 01:22:25,447
And how many minutes have passed?

1074
01:22:25,675 --> 01:22:27,004
About 5.

1075
01:22:27,749 --> 01:22:30,141
Are you sure it takes 10 minutes?

1076
01:22:30,635 --> 01:22:34,395
Oh, leave me alone. After the headstand
we have to wait another 20 minutes.

1077
01:22:35,274 --> 01:22:37,838
Another 20 minutes? Why didn't
you take the pill earlier?

1078
01:22:37,958 --> 01:22:39,527
I don't need it with the other girl.

1079
01:22:39,901 --> 01:22:42,028
You dare saying this to
me in my own bedroom?

1080
01:22:42,148 --> 01:22:44,711
Let the lights burn in your bedrooms,

1081
01:22:44,831 --> 01:22:47,192
maybe you have to say
something to each other.

1082
01:22:48,104 --> 01:22:49,977
That's what the sexologist says.

1083
01:22:53,479 --> 01:22:57,644
Pelvic base tense. Relax.

1084
01:22:58,416 --> 01:22:59,960
Tense.

1085
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:02,762
- Harmony of the soul.
- Relax.

1086
01:23:02,882 --> 01:23:06,306
Part of this harmony is,
that one saw the same movie,

1087
01:23:06,426 --> 01:23:10,154
read the same magazine,
listened to the same record.

1088
01:23:11,456 --> 01:23:12,949
And now please.

1089
01:23:17,203 --> 01:23:18,342
Good, good.

1090
01:23:21,529 --> 01:23:24,428
Was something wrong? Should
I have done it differently?

1091
01:23:24,719 --> 01:23:25,833
I don't know.

1092
01:23:26,188 --> 01:23:27,631
Something is wrong.

1093
01:23:28,770 --> 01:23:31,453
What is it? Da Capo.

1094
01:23:31,934 --> 01:23:37,352
Love sounds with moaning effects.
33 RPM. Longplay.

1095
01:23:39,124 --> 01:23:41,972
The erogenous zones of the
woman are behind the ears,

1096
01:23:42,835 --> 01:23:44,063
the neck,

1097
01:23:47,366 --> 01:23:48,987
and the nipples.

1098
01:23:51,966 --> 01:23:54,023
Inside the thighs.

1099
01:24:03,548 --> 01:24:05,035
No tickling please.

1100
01:24:05,155 --> 01:24:08,200
The erogenous zones of
the man are below the...

1101
01:24:08,516 --> 01:24:10,194
We know, we know.

1102
01:24:10,684 --> 01:24:12,061
And our hero knows it too.

1103
01:24:12,741 --> 01:24:13,770
I'm sorry.

1104
01:24:15,478 --> 01:24:16,950
I don't know what it is.

1105
01:24:20,044 --> 01:24:21,294
Maybe...

1106
01:24:24,728 --> 01:24:27,703
Maybe erection depression.

1107
01:24:29,712 --> 01:24:30,803
No.

1108
01:24:31,340 --> 01:24:33,904
For sure not. More a
psychogenic distortion.

1109
01:24:34,173 --> 01:24:37,116
Yes, it exists. The psychogram is wrong.

1110
01:24:37,236 --> 01:24:41,182
To slow effleurage, to early detumescence
and so on and so on. We know.

1111
01:24:41,455 --> 01:24:43,569
Rubbish! We know nothing.

1112
01:24:43,689 --> 01:24:47,252
Only the scientists know, the
sexologist, the psychologist. They say

1113
01:24:47,372 --> 01:24:51,163
2 out of 5 men are impotent nowadays
and this is not a question of age.

1114
01:24:51,481 --> 01:24:55,203
30% of the women don't know how
an orgasm feels, they say.

1115
01:24:55,772 --> 01:24:59,924
The waiting rooms of the mind doctors are
more than full. The university institutes

1116
01:25:00,044 --> 01:25:03,777
spread questionnaires.
Damn it, one wants to know

1117
01:25:03,897 --> 01:25:06,220
what is wrong and why it is wrong.

1118
01:25:09,316 --> 01:25:12,304
Have you ever seen a naked man?

1119
01:25:12,658 --> 01:25:15,595
If yes how old, how naked, and how big.

1120
01:25:15,715 --> 01:25:18,063
Did you ever have a sexual encounter?

1121
01:25:18,183 --> 01:25:21,737
If yes, alone? With many? With animals?

1122
01:25:22,066 --> 01:25:23,990
Double-check your answers.

1123
01:25:24,110 --> 01:25:26,521
Do you like to repair doorknobs?

1124
01:25:26,778 --> 01:25:30,031
Have you ever dreamed of a green hatbox?

1125
01:25:30,285 --> 01:25:31,728
So what is it?

1126
01:25:32,348 --> 01:25:33,373
One moment.

1127
01:25:33,715 --> 01:25:35,158
We'll know soon.

1128
01:25:36,775 --> 01:25:40,117
In the labs movie cameras
are used to retain

1129
01:25:40,237 --> 01:25:43,484
the human lust reactions in every detail.

1130
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:48,198
Our lovely unknown from the
lab, how a mocker called her.

1131
01:25:48,831 --> 01:25:51,350
She donates lust like other donate blood.

1132
01:25:51,717 --> 01:25:56,274
But not watched by sensual dreamers
but of white-coated scientists.

1133
01:25:56,881 --> 01:26:00,982
But who wants to doubt the
seriousness of white coats?

1134
01:26:03,470 --> 01:26:08,470
How gloriously unscientific our
great-great-great-great-grandfathers were

1135
01:26:08,590 --> 01:26:12,220
while watching the public baths.

1136
01:26:18,735 --> 01:26:21,552
She should have taken off her panties.

1137
01:26:28,055 --> 01:26:32,917
We really shouldn't be surprised,
if this individual enjoyment

1138
01:26:33,037 --> 01:26:38,740
becomes the ideal, how our future
relationships will be judged.

1139
01:26:39,151 --> 01:26:42,157
Sexual tautological nonsense.

1140
01:26:45,582 --> 01:26:48,857
A priori, dear colleague,

1141
01:26:48,977 --> 01:26:51,357
not to deepen the gap

1142
01:26:51,477 --> 01:26:53,826
between the actual sex behavior

1143
01:26:53,946 --> 01:26:57,560
and the anachronistic customs and rules.
And that's what it does.

1144
01:27:09,189 --> 01:27:12,053
What we need is a sexual shock.

1145
01:27:13,287 --> 01:27:14,964
Take fresh cells, dear colleague.

1146
01:27:15,084 --> 01:27:18,619
More scientific severity, gentlemen.
It won't work.

1147
01:27:19,316 --> 01:27:20,317
Not so.

1148
01:27:34,281 --> 01:27:35,372
Well.

1149
01:27:36,021 --> 01:27:39,028
What happened to this sex?

1150
01:27:39,148 --> 01:27:44,118
Which according to its apostles should make
a used up civilization fruitful again.

1151
01:27:45,083 --> 01:27:47,938
A journey to new shores.

1152
01:27:48,058 --> 01:27:49,846
Sexual revolution.

1153
01:27:49,966 --> 01:27:53,780
April fool! As soon as the
revolution really started

1154
01:27:53,900 --> 01:27:57,815
it turned into manufacture.
Sexual democracy.

1155
01:27:57,935 --> 01:28:03,788
Consumption sex, ideological
sex, retort sex.

1156
01:28:56,958 --> 01:28:58,659
What all to participate in?

1157
01:28:59,371 --> 01:29:00,716
As a scientist,

1158
01:29:01,389 --> 01:29:04,237
these are superb times.

1159
01:29:05,127 --> 01:29:08,113
Getting really among the flesh.

1160
01:29:09,498 --> 01:29:10,843
Don't you think so too?

1161
01:29:12,143 --> 01:29:15,229
Anyway it is hard to believe.

1162
01:29:15,624 --> 01:29:18,037
Anyway there are still people asking,

1163
01:29:18,157 --> 01:29:21,696
Don't you have something new
for me, something crazy,

1164
01:29:22,586 --> 01:29:24,564
Really perverse?

1165
01:29:24,979 --> 01:29:27,986
If you ask me. I don't know.

1166
01:29:28,361 --> 01:29:30,082
What else should come?

1167
01:29:32,397 --> 01:29:35,859
Or do you know something? Something new?

1168
01:29:36,749 --> 01:29:38,252
Then write us.

1169
01:29:39,323 --> 01:29:40,724
A postcard is enough.

1170
01:29:41,495 --> 01:29:42,742
Password:

1171
01:29:45,029 --> 01:29:46,512
Birdie.

1172
01:29:46,632 --> 01:29:54,226
<i>Come, come, come, my loveliest birdie</i>

1173
01:29:55,195 --> 01:30:02,730
<i>so I don't forget to love.</i>

1174
01:30:03,663 --> 01:30:11,107
<i>We don't, don't, don't
want to be the laziest.</i>
