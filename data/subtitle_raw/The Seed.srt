00:01:40,747 --> 00:01:43,838
When you said middle of
nowhere, you weren't kidding.

3
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,277
- It's not much further.
- Wow, it's so

4
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:48,669
beautiful out here.

5
00:01:48,711 --> 00:01:50,671
Yeah, that's why my dad
bought the place.

6
00:01:50,713 --> 00:01:53,805
It's on 10 acres.
No one around for miles.

7
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:56,155
I told you we should
have gone to Aspen.

8
00:03:00,261 --> 00:03:03,178
Thanks. Keep the change.

9
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,100
This is your house?

10
00:03:12,142 --> 00:03:14,101
Well, my dad's technically.

11
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:20,065
Bling.
This place is B-L-I-N-G.

12
00:03:20,107 --> 00:03:24,722
- It's really nice.
- What time is this

13
00:03:24,764 --> 00:03:26,332
once-in-a-lifetime
meteor shower?

14
00:03:26,374 --> 00:03:27,986
Oh, it's supposed to be
like 10:00, I think.

15
00:03:28,028 --> 00:03:30,900
Sick.
This is going to be amazing.

16
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,560
Oh, God, I wish I could get
out here more often.

17
00:03:36,602 --> 00:03:40,825
This is fire!
100k likes here we come!

18
00:03:40,867 --> 00:03:42,217
Christ.

19
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:44,219
Deidre... is just...

20
00:03:44,261 --> 00:03:46,309
really different.

21
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:47,700
Yeah, I know.

22
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:52,924
Wow.

23
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:56,449
Check out this
motherfucking piscina.

24
00:03:56,491 --> 00:03:58,756
This will be sick
for my photo shoot.

25
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,630
What's up, guys? We're here.

26
00:04:03,672 --> 00:04:06,154
We made it.
It's going to be amazing.

27
00:04:06,196 --> 00:04:07,808
We're staying in this
really cool house

28
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:10,681
in the middle of
fucking nowhere.

29
00:04:10,723 --> 00:04:12,639
It's 3:30
or something like that.

30
00:04:12,681 --> 00:04:14,337
The sun is shining

31
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,600
and it's seven hours
countdown to the meteor shower

32
00:04:16,642 --> 00:04:18,602
storm... thing.

33
00:04:18,644 --> 00:04:21,169
- Live stream.
- D, don't.

34
00:04:21,211 --> 00:04:24,303
Here we are with that
Yoga with Heather 97.

35
00:04:24,345 --> 00:04:26,000
Check her out.

36
00:04:26,042 --> 00:04:28,263
Follow her for
your spiritual fix.

37
00:04:28,305 --> 00:04:31,745
Namaste.

38
00:04:31,787 --> 00:04:34,966
Check out this bed. Whoo!

39
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:37,925
And Charlotte.
She's not on social media.

40
00:04:37,967 --> 00:04:39,187
She doesn't believe in it.
It's not her thing.

41
00:04:39,229 --> 00:04:40,580
And that's fine.

42
00:04:40,622 --> 00:04:42,408
But this? This is not fine.

43
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:43,931
Check this out.

44
00:04:43,973 --> 00:04:45,672
Retro!

45
00:04:45,714 --> 00:04:48,588
See it and believe it, people,
because it's true.

46
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,330
Some people are living there.
Stone Age best lives.

47
00:04:51,372 --> 00:04:54,377
She's hot, though.
Geek hot, but hot.

48
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:55,813
Hit her up.

49
00:04:55,855 --> 00:04:58,119
Wait, no, you can't,
because what?

50
00:04:58,161 --> 00:04:59,599
No social media?

51
00:04:59,641 --> 00:05:02,428
So send her a letter,
a telegram,

52
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:05,170
a smoke signal or DM me
and I'll hook you up.

53
00:05:05,212 --> 00:05:07,041
Squad goals.

54
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:09,566
Three hot babes stargazing.

55
00:05:09,608 --> 00:05:11,916
We're here to party...
Whoo!...

56
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:13,352
and watch the biggest
shooting star event

57
00:05:13,394 --> 00:05:14,614
since the dinosaurs checked out.

58
00:05:14,656 --> 00:05:17,791
Alright, that's D.

59
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:21,273
- Deidre, what the fuck?
- What?

60
00:05:21,315 --> 00:05:23,841
You'll get likes.
I'm telling you, mucholikes.

61
00:05:23,883 --> 00:05:26,321
Geek hot is so far
at the moment.

62
00:05:26,363 --> 00:05:29,020
- I don't want likes.
- What?

63
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:32,458
You're crazy.
Shit, girl. You need some.

64
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,328
Yeah? It's really invasive.

65
00:05:41,161 --> 00:05:45,428
Guys, it's been way too long.
I'm so glad we did this.

66
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,473
Me too.
I love the pet store,

67
00:05:47,515 --> 00:05:50,650
but I really needed
a couple of days off.

68
00:06:00,615 --> 00:06:03,489
I really need to get laid,
guys.

69
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:05,317
It's been a while.

70
00:06:05,359 --> 00:06:07,450
Yeah, I feel you.

71
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,190
You got any hot friends
out here?

72
00:06:09,232 --> 00:06:11,758
Mnh-mnh. No chance.

73
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,586
Never met anyone
out here my age.

74
00:06:13,628 --> 00:06:14,631
Nothing.

75
00:06:14,673 --> 00:06:16,415
Nothing.

76
00:06:16,457 --> 00:06:19,070
Literally no one around.

77
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:22,377
Oh, apart from this guy.

78
00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:24,249
Hmm.

79
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:25,729
An actual cowboy.

80
00:06:25,771 --> 00:06:27,948
You'd make a lovely couple.

81
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:30,864
Oh, please.

82
00:06:30,906 --> 00:06:33,258
And that's it.

83
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,823
No sex this weekend.

84
00:06:38,435 --> 00:06:41,222
You ever seen
a meteor shower before?

85
00:06:41,264 --> 00:06:43,355
Mm-hmm. Once in Costa Rica.

86
00:06:43,397 --> 00:06:46,140
It was amazing, guys.

87
00:06:46,182 --> 00:06:47,925
That when you met Phillip?

88
00:06:47,967 --> 00:06:49,403
Mm-hmm.

89
00:06:50,926 --> 00:06:52,277
How's that going anyway?

90
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,062
Good. Okay.

91
00:06:55,104 --> 00:06:57,630
He's teaching a yoga retreat
in Colorado this weekend.

92
00:06:57,672 --> 00:07:00,372
Is he watching
the meteor shower, too?

93
00:07:00,414 --> 00:07:01,634
Yeah, they're doing like
a whole ceremony thing.

94
00:07:01,676 --> 00:07:02,896
Have you heard from Schoze?

95
00:07:02,938 --> 00:07:05,551
Not since we got here.
His loss.

96
00:07:05,593 --> 00:07:08,293
He's probably fucking
Candace this weekend.

97
00:07:08,335 --> 00:07:09,337
He's only interested
because she's got like

98
00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:11,381
a million followers.

99
00:07:13,993 --> 00:07:15,866
Schoze will screw anyone
for a shout-out.

100
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:24,048
Fuck him.

101
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:25,961
And fuck Candace.

102
00:07:29,878 --> 00:07:31,795
You're building a makeup line.

103
00:07:31,837 --> 00:07:33,710
Oh, you guys,

104
00:07:33,752 --> 00:07:34,885
I finally got the name.

105
00:07:34,927 --> 00:07:37,322
Yeah? What is it?

106
00:07:37,364 --> 00:07:41,587
I'm D, and I'm fine,
and it defines.

107
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:44,024
Huh?
I don't get it.

108
00:07:44,066 --> 00:07:47,419
I'm D, and I'm fine,

109
00:07:47,461 --> 00:07:50,290
and it defines.

110
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,731
That's awesome.

111
00:07:54,773 --> 00:07:56,341
I know.

112
00:08:01,954 --> 00:08:03,130
What?

113
00:08:03,172 --> 00:08:05,872
What?

114
00:08:09,004 --> 00:08:10,398
Gimme.

115
00:08:27,196 --> 00:08:28,329
Wow!

116
00:08:31,331 --> 00:08:32,899
Beautiful.

117
00:08:32,941 --> 00:08:35,293
Ugh. Fuck me.

118
00:08:35,335 --> 00:08:37,121
Goddamn piece of shit.

119
00:08:37,163 --> 00:08:39,297
What's a girl got to do
to get a goddamn signal?

120
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:40,428
Whoa!

121
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:42,517
Amazing.

122
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,651
- That one was huge.
- Motherfucker.

123
00:08:45,693 --> 00:08:49,176
Fucking signal's fucked.
Fucking live stream, fuck you.

124
00:08:49,218 --> 00:08:51,875
Deidre, you're missing it.

125
00:08:51,917 --> 00:08:53,659
I've got no signal, either.

126
00:08:59,315 --> 00:09:00,708
Wow.

127
00:09:02,928 --> 00:09:06,019
Is it supposed to do that?

128
00:09:06,061 --> 00:09:08,587
I guess. I mean, it is

129
00:09:08,629 --> 00:09:10,284
a once-in-a-lifetime
meteor shower.

130
00:09:10,326 --> 00:09:11,808
Unbelievable.

131
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,723
Here we are watching the event
of a lifetime,

132
00:09:13,765 --> 00:09:15,680
and I cannot get
a goddamn signal.

133
00:09:16,811 --> 00:09:18,204
Whoa.

134
00:09:24,036 --> 00:09:25,648
Is it supposed to do that?

135
00:09:30,216 --> 00:09:32,132
Wow.

136
00:09:32,174 --> 00:09:34,221
Wow.

137
00:09:34,263 --> 00:09:36,267
Beautiful.

138
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:47,757
Margaritas. Nice.

139
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:50,368
Cheers.

140
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,938
I've turned the Wi-Fi
on and off

141
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,026
like a thousand times.

142
00:09:56,068 --> 00:09:57,462
Still can't get any signal.

143
00:10:02,509 --> 00:10:05,470
Whoa, that's... strong.

144
00:10:05,512 --> 00:10:07,254
Ugh.

145
00:10:07,296 --> 00:10:08,473
Whew!

146
00:10:12,258 --> 00:10:13,955
It's just like old times.

147
00:10:15,435 --> 00:10:17,917
You remember when we went
camping in school?

148
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:20,006
I fucking hate camping.

149
00:10:20,048 --> 00:10:23,096
Yeah, especially when
D tells you stories

150
00:10:23,138 --> 00:10:26,056
about killer bears
who only ate children.

151
00:10:26,098 --> 00:10:28,798
Oh, my God. I remember.
Fucking terrifying.

152
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,757
- I was so scared.
- Yeah, me too.

153
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:33,846
I mean, I didn't leave the
window open until I was,

154
00:10:33,888 --> 00:10:37,850
- like, 13.
- Get a grip.

155
00:10:37,892 --> 00:10:43,464
- Seriously.
- I mean, you were pretty mean.

156
00:10:43,506 --> 00:10:48,295
Is it my fault you're both
a couple of little babies?

157
00:10:48,337 --> 00:10:50,950
Remember that time
you got your head beaten in

158
00:10:50,992 --> 00:10:53,692
by that fat bitch,
Jennifer Hopkins?

159
00:10:53,734 --> 00:10:55,085
Saved your ass then, no?

160
00:10:55,127 --> 00:10:56,911
Yeah, you did.

161
00:10:58,173 --> 00:11:00,046
Yeah.

162
00:11:00,088 --> 00:11:02,875
You were pretty mean, though.

163
00:11:02,917 --> 00:11:06,618
Tough. Not mean.

164
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,576
And cute.

165
00:11:08,618 --> 00:11:10,361
Very cute.

166
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:13,277
You know, you can't just
let people walk all over you.

167
00:11:13,319 --> 00:11:14,713
Shit,
you got to have a mean side

168
00:11:14,755 --> 00:11:16,976
or how are you going to survive?

169
00:11:17,018 --> 00:11:18,369
You're not.

170
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:20,371
You know, it happens to pussies?

171
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:21,502
No?

172
00:11:21,544 --> 00:11:22,939
They get fucked.

173
00:11:22,981 --> 00:11:24,636
What the holy fuck?!

174
00:11:27,986 --> 00:11:29,946
Oh, my God.

175
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,566
Where the fuck that come from?

176
00:11:41,608 --> 00:11:43,307
Oh, my God.

177
00:11:43,349 --> 00:11:45,352
It's leaking.

178
00:11:45,394 --> 00:11:47,093
What? Shit!
Get out of the pool.

179
00:11:47,135 --> 00:11:48,920
My dad's going
to fucking kill me.

180
00:11:50,225 --> 00:11:51,663
What the fuck is it?

181
00:11:51,705 --> 00:11:54,318
Maybe it's a meteor.

182
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,364
- D, please help me with this.
- Right.

183
00:11:57,406 --> 00:11:59,540
Just get it out. Get it out!

184
00:11:59,582 --> 00:12:02,369
- Okay, hon, chill.
- My God. Get it out.

185
00:12:02,411 --> 00:12:03,893
- You got it?
- Oh, my God.

186
00:12:03,935 --> 00:12:05,285
You got it?

187
00:12:05,327 --> 00:12:06,894
Yeah. I think so.

188
00:12:10,506 --> 00:12:12,508
- Okay.
- On the towels.

189
00:12:14,815 --> 00:12:17,297
On the towels! Oh, my God!
The decking!

190
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:18,603
Oh, my God, is the decking okay?

191
00:12:18,645 --> 00:12:20,910
Tell me it's okay.
It's okay.

192
00:12:20,952 --> 00:12:23,173
- It's not staining.
- It's not?

193
00:12:23,215 --> 00:12:26,132
No. Look. See?

194
00:12:26,174 --> 00:12:27,349
It's okay, honey.

195
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:33,661
- What is it?
- Looks too soft to be a meteor.

196
00:12:33,703 --> 00:12:35,402
I don't know.

197
00:12:35,444 --> 00:12:37,404
Oh, my God. It stinks.

198
00:12:37,446 --> 00:12:40,930
It stinks of ass.
Oh, my God, that is so bad.

199
00:12:40,972 --> 00:12:41,973
But what is it?

200
00:12:43,452 --> 00:12:45,717
I think it's...

201
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:47,414
shit.

202
00:12:47,456 --> 00:12:50,156
I think God took a shit
in your pool, Heather.

203
00:12:50,198 --> 00:12:52,593
- That's not funny.
- No, but seriously,

204
00:12:52,635 --> 00:12:54,334
it's shit from a plane.

205
00:12:54,376 --> 00:12:56,641
You know, they freeze
all the passenger shit in planes

206
00:12:56,683 --> 00:12:58,164
and then drop it at once
it's full?

207
00:12:58,206 --> 00:12:59,818
Schoze knew this one guy

208
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,428
who was eating
a sandwich in his kitchen,

209
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:04,344
and then one day a giant block
of frozen shit

210
00:13:04,386 --> 00:13:06,433
the size of a refrigerator

211
00:13:06,475 --> 00:13:09,436
fell through his roof
and killed him.

212
00:13:09,478 --> 00:13:13,832
- I don't think they do that, D.
- What do you know?

213
00:13:13,874 --> 00:13:16,661
You don't even Google.

214
00:13:16,703 --> 00:13:19,184
Well, what do youthink it is?

215
00:13:21,316 --> 00:13:24,319
Oh, my God.
It's got a little face.

216
00:13:27,105 --> 00:13:29,281
I think it's... an animal.

217
00:13:30,325 --> 00:13:33,547
- What kind of animal?
- I don't know.

218
00:13:33,589 --> 00:13:36,637
It's... It's kind of
balled up like an

219
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:37,943
armadillo or something,

220
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:41,425
I-I'm not sure.

221
00:13:41,467 --> 00:13:43,775
Well, whatever it is,
it's fucking dead.

222
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,170
Oh.

223
00:13:51,607 --> 00:13:53,785
Oh, my God,
un-fucking-believable.

224
00:13:53,827 --> 00:13:55,352
This is content gold.

225
00:14:22,551 --> 00:14:24,729
Don't think it's an armadillo.

226
00:14:30,385 --> 00:14:32,128
Thanks.

227
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:34,217
- I'm okay.
- Drink it.

228
00:14:34,259 --> 00:14:35,608
For your nerves.

229
00:14:43,181 --> 00:14:46,055
I want it out of here.

230
00:14:46,097 --> 00:14:48,666
I can still smell it.

231
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:51,974
It could be a bear
made with an armadillo.

232
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:55,934
What?
And taught itself to fly?

233
00:14:55,976 --> 00:14:58,458
- Oh, yeah.
- What are we gonna do with it?

234
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,938
I mean, how are we going to
get rid of it?

235
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,461
I don't know.
Stick it in the trash?

236
00:15:07,205 --> 00:15:09,076
Oh, my God.

237
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,516
We could bury it...

238
00:15:12,558 --> 00:15:14,126
under a tree or something.

239
00:15:14,168 --> 00:15:15,823
What? No!

240
00:15:15,865 --> 00:15:18,217
It's got to go.

241
00:15:18,259 --> 00:15:20,524
Come on, babe.

242
00:15:20,566 --> 00:15:22,698
Let's get you off to bed.

243
00:15:29,531 --> 00:15:30,969
- Charles?
- Hmm?

244
00:15:31,011 --> 00:15:33,928
Oh, I'm going to stay up
for a little while.

245
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:35,537
Okay.

246
00:15:37,235 --> 00:15:38,846
Stay away from it.

247
00:15:38,888 --> 00:15:40,457
It could have a disease
or something disease.

248
00:15:40,499 --> 00:15:43,632
- Disease?
- No. No diseases.

249
00:16:50,873 --> 00:16:53,269
Hey.

250
00:16:53,311 --> 00:16:55,053
Morning.

251
00:16:55,095 --> 00:16:57,316
- You sleep okay?
- Mm.

252
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,929
Uh...

253
00:17:01,971 --> 00:17:03,975
I'm sorry about last night.

254
00:17:04,017 --> 00:17:05,542
I was just a bit...

255
00:17:05,584 --> 00:17:09,763
Oh, it's fine.
It's your dad's place.

256
00:17:09,805 --> 00:17:11,461
You don't want it
to get fucked up.

257
00:17:11,503 --> 00:17:14,377
- We get it.
- You're the best, Charles.

258
00:17:14,419 --> 00:17:16,683
- Thanks.
- Oh.

259
00:17:16,725 --> 00:17:19,598
Oh, my gosh, my head.

260
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:23,993
- I am not used to tequila.
- Me neither.

261
00:17:30,522 --> 00:17:33,004
Jesus Christ.

262
00:17:33,046 --> 00:17:36,486
- It just died.
- So weird.

263
00:17:36,528 --> 00:17:39,706
I'm actually
freaking out right now.

264
00:17:39,748 --> 00:17:41,012
Don't you have a landline?

265
00:17:41,054 --> 00:17:42,709
We could call a cab
and go into town.

266
00:17:42,751 --> 00:17:44,842
People don't use
landlines anymore.

267
00:17:44,884 --> 00:17:47,539
- What about yours?
- It's in the bedroom.

268
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:51,718
Can you get it?

269
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,153
Uh...

270
00:18:09,561 --> 00:18:11,216
Do you have signal?

271
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:12,564
Yeah.

272
00:18:17,525 --> 00:18:19,137
Oh, wait. What the...?

273
00:18:19,179 --> 00:18:20,747
What's happened?

274
00:18:20,789 --> 00:18:22,227
I don't know.
It just sort of...

275
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:24,577
Shit.

276
00:18:24,619 --> 00:18:28,538
I mean, it is kind of old.
I was meaning to get a new one.

277
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,844
Great. That's just great.

278
00:18:30,886 --> 00:18:33,673
How am I going to post
the photo shoot?

279
00:18:33,715 --> 00:18:36,763
Maybe it's magnets
and the meteor shower.

280
00:18:36,805 --> 00:18:38,461
There was this thing called
the Carrington Event

281
00:18:38,503 --> 00:18:41,681
in, like, the 1850s,
like a geomagnetic storm

282
00:18:41,723 --> 00:18:45,076
that knocked out all the radio
waves around the world.

283
00:18:45,118 --> 00:18:46,860
Magnets in the meteor shower?

284
00:18:46,902 --> 00:18:50,908
Magnetic storms?
Where do you get this stuff?

285
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:53,692
Mm. Books, newspapers.

286
00:18:56,477 --> 00:18:59,917
People are going to think
I'm dead, like I've died.

287
00:18:59,959 --> 00:19:02,180
- They won't.
- They will.

288
00:19:02,222 --> 00:19:03,573
They'll post about it
everywhere.

289
00:19:03,615 --> 00:19:05,270
Then my mom will see it.

290
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:06,924
She'll get freaked out
and then she'll kill herself.

291
00:19:06,966 --> 00:19:10,623
Shit, D.
It's only been like 24 hours.

292
00:19:10,665 --> 00:19:14,497
24 hours is like a lifetime
on the Internet.

293
00:19:14,539 --> 00:19:15,889
I've got sponsors.

294
00:19:15,931 --> 00:19:19,284
I don't post,
I don't get paid.

295
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:21,808
Fuck it.
I'm done. It's over.

296
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:23,199
I'm over. "Hashtag dead."

297
00:19:28,117 --> 00:19:29,641
What about the thing?

298
00:19:30,772 --> 00:19:33,471
- Shit.
- I totally forgot.

299
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:45,658
- Where is it?
- I don't know.

300
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,313
Maybe it can fly.

301
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:49,661
Is it really gone?

302
00:20:02,151 --> 00:20:03,588
Where the fuck is it?

303
00:20:11,683 --> 00:20:12,772
Wait here.

304
00:20:15,469 --> 00:20:16,820
Hey.

305
00:20:16,862 --> 00:20:18,343
It'll be okay.

306
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:20,127
We can clean this up.
No problem.

307
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:29,091
Careful, it's my dad.

308
00:20:30,702 --> 00:20:32,139
Just be on the safe side.

309
00:21:04,823 --> 00:21:07,523
Animals must have dragged it.

310
00:21:07,565 --> 00:21:09,089
What animals?

311
00:21:09,131 --> 00:21:11,004
Coyotes maybe.

312
00:21:11,046 --> 00:21:13,790
- Coyotes?
- They're not dangerous.

313
00:21:13,832 --> 00:21:15,139
Not really.

314
00:21:15,181 --> 00:21:17,141
God, it's disgusting.

315
00:21:17,183 --> 00:21:20,013
My God, what the fuck?
It stinks worse than yesterday.

316
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,757
Where's its shell gone?

317
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,933
That's what you're
worried about?

318
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:50,696
- Hi.
- Jesus Christ.

319
00:21:50,738 --> 00:21:52,263
I'm Brett.

320
00:21:52,305 --> 00:21:54,004
I'm here to do the garden.

321
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:56,788
Oh, great. You work for my dad.

322
00:21:59,138 --> 00:22:00,706
My dad.

323
00:22:00,748 --> 00:22:03,970
I don't know your dad.
Agency booked my brother.

324
00:22:04,012 --> 00:22:05,449
He got sick.

325
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:26,689
Go on.

326
00:22:26,731 --> 00:22:28,255
Ask him.

327
00:22:28,297 --> 00:22:30,083
Ask him what?

328
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:32,956
The thing?

329
00:22:32,998 --> 00:22:36,916
Oh, my God.
He can take it away.

330
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:38,482
Oh, my God, great idea.

331
00:22:40,135 --> 00:22:41,441
Hi.

332
00:22:43,182 --> 00:22:45,316
Got some shit on you?

333
00:22:45,358 --> 00:22:47,753
Oh, we had an accident.

334
00:22:47,795 --> 00:22:49,973
A thing. An animal.

335
00:22:50,015 --> 00:22:54,020
Um, a dead armadillo or like
a bear thing fell on our pool.

336
00:22:54,062 --> 00:22:55,892
Oh, yeah?

337
00:22:55,934 --> 00:22:59,894
Ugh, it's still sort of here,
like, dead just over there.

338
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,987
- A dead armadillo?
- Right.

339
00:23:04,029 --> 00:23:05,858
Well, we were wondering maybe
that you...

340
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,992
Listen, I'm just coming for
my brother.

341
00:23:09,034 --> 00:23:11,385
Dead armadillo is...

342
00:23:11,427 --> 00:23:13,995
That's, like,
another department.

343
00:23:17,259 --> 00:23:21,526
I mean, we could give you
some money to take it away.

344
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:23,439
It would be really helpful.

345
00:23:26,704 --> 00:23:28,575
How much?

346
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:36,672
It don't look like no armadillo.

347
00:23:36,714 --> 00:23:38,237
Oh.

348
00:23:40,195 --> 00:23:41,198
Oh.

349
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,417
It stinks like ass.

350
00:23:43,459 --> 00:23:46,506
$150 and a download link
to the photos.

351
00:23:49,596 --> 00:23:52,514
You really are models?

352
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:54,296
Of course we are, Brett.

353
00:23:56,516 --> 00:23:59,390
Nah, that's bullshit.
Deal's off.

354
00:24:03,218 --> 00:24:05,222
I can just send you
the ones of me.

355
00:24:05,264 --> 00:24:06,744
There's way hotter
on the Internet.

356
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,707
What the fuck?

357
00:24:11,749 --> 00:24:14,187
Okay? A $150 in cash

358
00:24:14,229 --> 00:24:15,667
and then we'll just transfer
you the rest

359
00:24:15,709 --> 00:24:16,842
when our phones are fixed.

360
00:24:16,884 --> 00:24:18,931
Do I look like an idiot to you?

361
00:24:18,973 --> 00:24:21,020
No!

362
00:24:23,151 --> 00:24:26,111
Please?
We really need your help.

363
00:24:27,982 --> 00:24:29,418
There is one thing.

364
00:24:38,776 --> 00:24:40,255
Unbelievable.

365
00:24:42,649 --> 00:24:44,827
Okay, let's get this over with.

366
00:24:44,869 --> 00:24:46,742
One quick kiss.

367
00:24:46,784 --> 00:24:49,483
- With tongues.
- No, Brett. No tongues.

368
00:24:49,525 --> 00:24:52,051
No hands. One kiss. That's it.

369
00:24:52,093 --> 00:24:54,445
You break the rules, you're
gonna get punched in the face.

370
00:24:54,487 --> 00:24:56,578
Okay?

371
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,447
Okay. Fine.

372
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,714
How old are you, anyway?

373
00:25:02,756 --> 00:25:05,021
15.

374
00:25:05,063 --> 00:25:06,238
And two months.

375
00:25:11,373 --> 00:25:13,682
Fuck my life.

376
00:25:13,724 --> 00:25:15,726
Ready?

377
00:25:17,728 --> 00:25:19,643
Ready, Brett.

378
00:25:49,977 --> 00:25:52,371
Okay, I'll go get the bear.

379
00:26:00,771 --> 00:26:04,950
Okay, so that's $50 a piece.

380
00:26:04,992 --> 00:26:08,258
- I don't have $50.
- I got you, Charles.

381
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,695
Anything to get rid of that
thing and get my phone fixed.

382
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:12,305
Here.

383
00:26:12,347 --> 00:26:14,612
So, once Brett gets rid of
the dead thing,

384
00:26:14,654 --> 00:26:15,961
here's the plan.

385
00:26:16,003 --> 00:26:18,572
Quick trip to town.
Fix the phones.

386
00:26:18,614 --> 00:26:20,705
Grab a juice, cab back then,

387
00:26:20,747 --> 00:26:24,491
it's D-Fine photoshoot time.

388
00:26:24,533 --> 00:26:26,319
- I don't really wanna...
- You're gonna love it, Charles.

389
00:26:26,361 --> 00:26:28,365
I'm telling you
it's going to be fun.

390
00:26:28,407 --> 00:26:30,846
- But I...
- Charles, you only put $7

391
00:26:30,888 --> 00:26:32,978
into the get rid of the
ass-stinking dead bear fund,

392
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:36,373
- so please.
- But I...

393
00:26:36,415 --> 00:26:38,417
I kissed the, you know...

394
00:26:40,549 --> 00:26:41,942
...child.

395
00:26:45,685 --> 00:26:48,777
Didn't seem like too much
of a chore, hon.

396
00:26:48,819 --> 00:26:52,476
Hmm?

397
00:26:52,518 --> 00:26:54,783
Looked pretty hot
from where we're standing.

398
00:26:54,825 --> 00:26:56,393
What the fuck, D?

399
00:26:56,435 --> 00:26:58,134
You should definitely ask him
for his number.

400
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:01,964
- Definitely. Hot.
- Oh, my God. Fine.

401
00:27:02,006 --> 00:27:04,662
I'll do the damned shoot.

402
00:27:04,704 --> 00:27:08,144
This is going to be excellent.

403
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:15,238
Fuck.

404
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:30,079
- Charles, any requests?
- Just that we get it over with

405
00:27:30,121 --> 00:27:31,471
- fairly quickly.
- Oh, please,

406
00:27:31,513 --> 00:27:33,125
you're going to love it.

407
00:27:33,167 --> 00:27:36,389
I'll get the products.

408
00:27:36,431 --> 00:27:37,868
Heather.

409
00:27:57,626 --> 00:27:59,935
Fuck.

410
00:27:59,977 --> 00:28:01,284
Fucking thing.

411
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:17,342
What the fuck?

412
00:28:19,518 --> 00:28:20,649
Brett!

413
00:28:22,782 --> 00:28:24,307
Brett!

414
00:28:45,152 --> 00:28:47,504
Oh, my fucking God.

415
00:28:47,546 --> 00:28:49,767
No way.

416
00:28:49,809 --> 00:28:51,073
We have to.

417
00:28:51,115 --> 00:28:52,944
- No.
- Heather?

418
00:28:52,986 --> 00:28:54,467
I don't care what Heather says.

419
00:28:54,509 --> 00:28:56,295
I'm not letting you
kill an innocent animal.

420
00:28:56,337 --> 00:28:58,907
- It's sick. It's already dying.
- Fucking Brett.

421
00:28:58,949 --> 00:29:00,212
What are we going to do now?

422
00:29:00,254 --> 00:29:01,953
How are we gonna
get rid of that thing?

423
00:29:01,995 --> 00:29:03,346
My dad's gonna fucking kill me,
and my phone is still

424
00:29:03,388 --> 00:29:05,348
- not working.
- Your dad cannot blame you

425
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:07,306
for a crash-landing armadillo.

426
00:29:07,348 --> 00:29:09,221
No, it's definitely
not an armadillo.

427
00:29:09,263 --> 00:29:12,181
Well, whatever it is,
killing it is the kind of thing.

428
00:29:12,223 --> 00:29:15,314
- With what?
- I don't know.

429
00:29:15,356 --> 00:29:17,926
This bat or poison?

430
00:29:17,968 --> 00:29:19,014
You can't go around
killing things, D.

431
00:29:19,056 --> 00:29:20,580
Of course you can.

432
00:29:20,622 --> 00:29:23,235
People shoot sick horses
and dogs all the time, no?

433
00:29:23,277 --> 00:29:26,412
People don't shoot sick dogs,
D.

434
00:29:26,454 --> 00:29:27,979
We don't even know
if it's dying.

435
00:29:28,021 --> 00:29:30,852
Oh, come on.
It's so is. Heather?

436
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:32,375
- Hmm?
- We put it out of its misery,

437
00:29:32,417 --> 00:29:34,681
- no?
- You wantto kill it!

438
00:29:34,723 --> 00:29:35,987
Don't be ridiculous.

439
00:29:36,029 --> 00:29:37,728
You're a psychopath.
Heather?

440
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:40,165
you're a little baby.
Heather? We kill it, no?

441
00:29:40,207 --> 00:29:42,733
What? Don't look at me.
I don't want to decide.

442
00:29:42,775 --> 00:29:44,474
But can you please
put that thing away?

443
00:29:54,961 --> 00:29:56,441
I told you it was dying.

444
00:30:04,449 --> 00:30:07,584
Hey, little guy.

445
00:30:07,626 --> 00:30:10,456
Charlotte, be careful.

446
00:30:10,498 --> 00:30:12,328
Doesn't look well.

447
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:14,634
- Like I said...
- We're not killing it, D!

448
00:30:14,676 --> 00:30:17,811
- It would be really bad karma.
- Jesus Christ.

449
00:30:17,853 --> 00:30:19,639
Okay, okay. How about this?

450
00:30:19,681 --> 00:30:22,207
We drag it away from the house,
at least,

451
00:30:22,249 --> 00:30:25,384
leave it under a bush
or something.

452
00:30:25,426 --> 00:30:29,345
I guess. I mean, in the shade,
it might get better.

453
00:30:29,387 --> 00:30:31,695
We can leave it
a bowl of water.

454
00:30:31,737 --> 00:30:33,175
Sure.

455
00:30:33,217 --> 00:30:34,350
Fine.

456
00:30:34,392 --> 00:30:35,917
You're both so lame.

457
00:30:38,048 --> 00:30:40,617
Poor thing.

458
00:31:18,349 --> 00:31:22,267
Shit, that motherfucker
is heavy.

459
00:31:22,309 --> 00:31:24,356
I feel really dizzy.

460
00:31:24,398 --> 00:31:26,748
I'm going to go and get it
a bowl of water.

461
00:31:29,795 --> 00:31:32,190
Can we have some fun now,
please?

462
00:31:32,232 --> 00:31:33,931
We came here to have
a good time, no?

463
00:31:33,973 --> 00:31:39,023
Not drag some stinking dying
bear around in the blazing heat.

464
00:31:39,065 --> 00:31:40,762
Shit.

465
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:51,998
Oh, my God.

466
00:34:56,784 --> 00:34:58,353
- Heather.
- Huh? Huh?

467
00:34:58,395 --> 00:35:00,833
- Heather.
- What? No.

468
00:35:00,875 --> 00:35:03,009
The decking.

469
00:35:03,051 --> 00:35:04,836
- Heather, wake up.
- Huh?

470
00:35:06,707 --> 00:35:08,711
Charlotte.

471
00:35:08,753 --> 00:35:10,321
What's going on? I'm asleep.

472
00:35:10,363 --> 00:35:15,196
The thing, the bear thing...

473
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:18,286
- it's crying.
- Huh? What?

474
00:35:18,328 --> 00:35:20,418
Come see it.

475
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:23,158
For fuck's sake,
Charles, go back to sleep!

476
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:34,606
Okay, buddy.

477
00:35:34,648 --> 00:35:36,041
We can do is.

478
00:35:43,527 --> 00:35:47,793
Whoa. Maybe I'm still stoned,
but you seem lighter.

479
00:35:59,847 --> 00:36:02,939
Hey, little guy.

480
00:36:02,981 --> 00:36:04,723
Are you hungry?

481
00:36:44,501 --> 00:36:46,025
You were hungry.

482
00:37:59,532 --> 00:38:01,318
Ugh!

483
00:38:07,888 --> 00:38:11,415
What the fuck have you done?

484
00:38:11,457 --> 00:38:13,635
Oh, hey, D.

485
00:38:13,677 --> 00:38:16,028
Don't "Oh, hey, D" me.

486
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:17,943
I got two questions for you.

487
00:38:17,985 --> 00:38:21,338
One, what is that piss-leaking
dog rat doing in the house?

488
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:23,906
And two,
where's my motherfucking shake?

489
00:38:23,948 --> 00:38:26,648
What? What's going on? Shake?

490
00:38:30,258 --> 00:38:35,526
- How did you even carry it?
- I don't know. Seemed lighter.

491
00:38:35,568 --> 00:38:37,265
Get it out of my house.

492
00:38:40,573 --> 00:38:43,055
It was crying.

493
00:38:43,097 --> 00:38:45,360
- I couldn't just leave it...
- Out.

494
00:38:47,275 --> 00:38:48,626
Okay.

495
00:39:04,379 --> 00:39:06,557
Oh, my God!

496
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:08,080
I can't move it.

497
00:39:08,122 --> 00:39:09,821
It's stuck its claws in.

498
00:39:20,352 --> 00:39:22,485
It was crying.

499
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:28,666
It was crying?

500
00:39:28,708 --> 00:39:31,234
Let me break this down
for you, Charlotte.

501
00:39:31,276 --> 00:39:33,105
We're in the middle
of fucking nowhere.

502
00:39:33,147 --> 00:39:35,064
There is an animal...
I don't know what it is,

503
00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:37,240
I don't know where it's from.
You brought it into her house.

504
00:39:37,282 --> 00:39:40,591
You fed it my protein shake.
Here's what's going to happen.

505
00:39:40,633 --> 00:39:43,072
You're going to hitch
your little ass back into town,

506
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:47,772
find a vet
or an animal wrangler man,

507
00:39:47,814 --> 00:39:49,339
get him to come down here

508
00:39:49,381 --> 00:39:51,820
and get that thing
out of the goddamn house

509
00:39:51,862 --> 00:39:55,563
before we all get rabies
or Ebola or both.

510
00:39:55,605 --> 00:39:56,606
Okay?

511
00:39:59,304 --> 00:40:00,653
Yeah. Okay.

512
00:40:03,482 --> 00:40:07,226
Now, I'm going back to bed.

513
00:40:07,268 --> 00:40:09,532
Do not wake me up
until it's gone.

514
00:40:12,099 --> 00:40:15,015
And take the goddamn phones
and get them fixed too.

515
00:40:17,322 --> 00:40:20,370
This is not what our weekend
was supposed to be like...

516
00:40:20,412 --> 00:40:23,634
running around
trying to deal with a dead bear.

517
00:40:23,676 --> 00:40:27,333
It's not cool, not cool at all.

518
00:40:27,375 --> 00:40:29,031
I'm sorry.

519
00:40:29,073 --> 00:40:31,555
- It's just it was...
- I know.

520
00:40:31,597 --> 00:40:32,598
Crying.

521
00:40:36,776 --> 00:40:38,735
I was a bit high too.

522
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:45,221
Okay.

523
00:40:45,263 --> 00:40:46,962
But just don't ever, ever, ever,
ever,

524
00:40:47,004 --> 00:40:50,226
ever pull some shit
like this ever fucking again.

525
00:40:51,399 --> 00:40:52,924
Okay, I know.

526
00:40:52,966 --> 00:40:55,448
My dad is a buggy in the garage.

527
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:58,234
The nearest neighbor is
this weird old lady called Edna.

528
00:40:58,276 --> 00:41:00,018
We can drive down to Edna's
and see if she'll give us

529
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:02,238
a ride into town.

530
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:05,676
We can kind of vet.
Or Wrangler man or whatever.

531
00:41:05,718 --> 00:41:09,027
Get my phone fixed.
Get rid of that creature.

532
00:41:09,069 --> 00:41:13,728
Grab a latte, and get back
to chill mode.

533
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:15,164
We're calm.

534
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:16,599
I'm calm.

535
00:41:18,557 --> 00:41:21,083
That's a good plan.

536
00:41:21,125 --> 00:41:22,954
Now, I don't know
how reliable this is,

537
00:41:22,996 --> 00:41:25,522
but I'm sure it'll get
us Edna's and back.

538
00:41:25,564 --> 00:41:28,177
- Really?
- Mm.

539
00:41:31,396 --> 00:41:32,529
Told you.

540
00:42:18,051 --> 00:42:20,229
You motherfucker.

541
00:42:54,958 --> 00:42:56,613
Hey, little guy.

542
00:42:56,655 --> 00:42:58,049
Thirsty?

543
00:43:24,117 --> 00:43:25,423
There.

544
00:43:46,705 --> 00:43:49,666
Wow.

545
00:43:49,708 --> 00:43:50,798
She lives out here
all on her own?

546
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:53,931
- Mm-hmm.
- Cool.

547
00:43:53,973 --> 00:43:55,890
She's a bit eccentric.

548
00:43:55,932 --> 00:43:58,631
Like, she's into
some weird science shit.

549
00:43:58,673 --> 00:44:00,242
It's cool, though.
She's definitely cool.

550
00:44:00,284 --> 00:44:02,766
And she gave me
some weed last summer.

551
00:44:02,808 --> 00:44:04,157
- Nice.
- Mm-hmm.

552
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:13,037
- That's strange.
- What?

553
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:16,127
She's got this big dog
who normally goes crazy

554
00:44:16,169 --> 00:44:17,518
when anyone comes by.

555
00:44:25,875 --> 00:44:27,528
Miss Brunel?

556
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:33,621
Miss Brunel...?

557
00:44:39,149 --> 00:44:40,628
Miss Brunel?

558
00:44:58,342 --> 00:45:00,910
- Wow!
- I told you.

559
00:45:09,701 --> 00:45:11,442
Nothing.

560
00:45:14,924 --> 00:45:16,405
What is all this stuff?

561
00:45:23,976 --> 00:45:25,806
Okay, let's get out of here.

562
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:28,983
What about getting into town?

563
00:45:29,025 --> 00:45:30,722
I don't know.

564
00:45:33,116 --> 00:45:34,597
I'll leave her a note
in case she comes back.

565
00:45:42,081 --> 00:45:45,913
- That's weird.
- What?

566
00:45:45,955 --> 00:45:49,438
Isn't that yesterday?
The night of the meteor shower?

567
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:52,093
Mm-hmm.

568
00:45:52,135 --> 00:45:53,790
Strange.

569
00:45:53,832 --> 00:45:56,053
- How so?
- I don't know, it's just

570
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:59,840
really highlighted like a lot.

571
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:03,191
Well, maybe
it was her birthday.

572
00:46:03,233 --> 00:46:04,453
Maybe.

573
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:05,626
Okay, let's go.

574
00:46:08,064 --> 00:46:09,197
Charles, come on.

575
00:46:41,749 --> 00:46:44,797
You want the bad news
or the bad news?

576
00:46:44,839 --> 00:46:47,713
D?

577
00:46:47,755 --> 00:46:49,933
- Huh?
- Edna wasn't there.

578
00:46:49,975 --> 00:46:51,674
We couldn't get to town.

579
00:46:51,716 --> 00:46:53,371
Shit.

580
00:46:53,413 --> 00:46:54,458
That's bad.

581
00:46:59,028 --> 00:47:01,510
D.

582
00:47:01,552 --> 00:47:02,815
Hmm?

583
00:47:02,857 --> 00:47:04,208
You okay, babe?

584
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:06,384
Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah.

585
00:47:06,426 --> 00:47:08,604
Of course. Just a bit stoned.

586
00:47:08,646 --> 00:47:10,954
Yeah, um,
we couldn't get the vet.

587
00:47:10,996 --> 00:47:13,391
And the phones
are still fucked.

588
00:47:13,433 --> 00:47:15,480
It's okay.

589
00:47:15,522 --> 00:47:18,179
Don't worry about it.

590
00:47:18,221 --> 00:47:21,269
How are we going to get that
thing out of the goddamn house?

591
00:47:21,311 --> 00:47:24,141
Shit.
I'm with red on that one.

592
00:47:24,183 --> 00:47:26,142
Huh?

593
00:47:30,276 --> 00:47:33,107
Not my department.

594
00:47:33,149 --> 00:47:35,413
Right. Okay.

595
00:47:35,455 --> 00:47:37,457
Good. Great.

596
00:47:38,458 --> 00:47:40,895
It is kind of cute, actually.

597
00:47:48,468 --> 00:47:50,385
Do you want me to try
and move it again?

598
00:47:50,427 --> 00:47:51,952
Yeah. Wait, wait, wait.

599
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:53,910
Actually, I can't take
any more of it screaming.

600
00:47:53,952 --> 00:47:57,261
My nerves already shot to shit.

601
00:47:57,303 --> 00:47:59,263
If it damages anything
in this house, Charlotte...

602
00:47:59,305 --> 00:48:02,179
I will pay for it, I swear.

603
00:48:02,221 --> 00:48:03,788
With what, Charles? With that?

604
00:48:07,748 --> 00:48:10,448
I can make lunch.
Do you want some lunch?

605
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:15,236
- And I can clean.
- Un-fucking-believable.

606
00:48:15,278 --> 00:48:19,412
Okay, fine. Make some lunch
before I lose my fucking mind.

607
00:48:23,286 --> 00:48:25,159
I'm sorry, Heather.

608
00:49:19,516 --> 00:49:21,215
Mmm!

609
00:49:21,257 --> 00:49:22,736
That's good.

610
00:49:26,218 --> 00:49:27,480
Mmm.

611
00:49:30,135 --> 00:49:33,444
Mmm! So good.

612
00:49:33,486 --> 00:49:34,792
Hungry?

613
00:49:37,577 --> 00:49:39,101
- Huh?
- Nothing.

614
00:49:43,888 --> 00:49:45,629
You gonna eat that?

615
00:49:59,817 --> 00:50:01,906
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

616
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:04,867
Mmm.

617
00:50:07,825 --> 00:50:08,869
What?

618
00:50:10,871 --> 00:50:13,963
Oh, I feel amazing.

619
00:50:14,005 --> 00:50:15,617
Must be the fresh air.

620
00:50:15,659 --> 00:50:17,923
Do you guys want
to work out in a bit?

621
00:50:17,965 --> 00:50:20,926
It's, um,
it's a little hot at the moment.

622
00:50:20,968 --> 00:50:23,320
- No?
- I'm good.

623
00:50:23,362 --> 00:50:24,929
Suit yourselves.

624
00:50:30,717 --> 00:50:32,373
- What the fuck?
- I know.

625
00:50:32,415 --> 00:50:34,592
I really hope she's not
having another breakdown.

626
00:50:34,634 --> 00:50:37,595
Like, I remember when she
split up with James?

627
00:50:37,637 --> 00:50:38,596
Same thing.

628
00:50:45,079 --> 00:50:46,907
She's totally flipped.

629
00:50:48,561 --> 00:50:50,041
Maybe it's the come down?

630
00:50:51,695 --> 00:50:53,916
For fuck's sake!

631
00:50:53,958 --> 00:50:57,615
Oh, my God,
and it smells so bad.

632
00:50:57,657 --> 00:50:58,919
Maybe we could give it a bath.

633
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:02,664
I mean, if you can move it
without it

634
00:51:02,706 --> 00:51:05,101
tearing a hole in the rug.

635
00:51:05,143 --> 00:51:08,060
I just think it didn't want
to go back outside.

636
00:51:08,102 --> 00:51:10,367
You know what, Charlotte?
Be my guest.

637
00:51:10,409 --> 00:51:12,326
Please, give
the fucking hyena a bath,

638
00:51:12,368 --> 00:51:13,892
because you know what?

639
00:51:13,934 --> 00:51:15,893
This weekend literally
cannot get any weirder.

640
00:57:10,334 --> 00:57:13,251
Hey. Where's the...?

641
00:57:13,293 --> 00:57:15,297
We put him in my room.

642
00:57:15,339 --> 00:57:17,517
You did... what?

643
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:19,386
It's more comfortable
than the sofa.

644
00:57:21,301 --> 00:57:23,784
Huh.

645
00:57:23,826 --> 00:57:25,220
Nice day again.

646
00:57:25,262 --> 00:57:28,179
It really is.

647
00:57:33,792 --> 00:57:36,361
On the smokes already?

648
00:57:36,403 --> 00:57:39,408
Hey, look.
What time are we leaving?

649
00:57:39,450 --> 00:57:41,018
The phones aren't working.

650
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:42,759
Can't call a cab.

651
00:57:42,801 --> 00:57:44,544
I have to get back
for work tomorrow.

652
00:57:48,502 --> 00:57:50,724
Stoned out of your minds.

653
00:57:50,766 --> 00:57:52,202
Jesus Christ.

654
00:58:24,756 --> 00:58:28,109
I need to leave. Today.

655
00:58:28,151 --> 00:58:30,067
The phones are not working,
Charlotte.

656
00:58:30,109 --> 00:58:34,245
- What do you want to do?
- There's the buggy.

657
00:58:34,287 --> 00:58:37,422
It's not going to get us back
to town, though, is it?

658
00:58:37,464 --> 00:58:40,295
Don't you have to get back
for, like, work?

659
00:58:40,337 --> 00:58:41,731
Chill, Charles.

660
00:58:41,773 --> 00:58:44,429
One more day here.

661
00:58:44,471 --> 00:58:46,606
It's hardly a prison sentence.

662
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:48,999
I'll lose my job, D.

663
00:58:49,041 --> 00:58:51,698
You can do so much better,
though, really.

664
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:53,480
Sure. Okay, but...

665
00:58:55,265 --> 00:58:57,355
Are you really just
going to lie here all day?

666
00:58:57,397 --> 00:58:59,096
Wait for someone to come by?

667
00:58:59,138 --> 00:59:01,533
That's the big plan?

668
00:59:01,575 --> 00:59:04,145
Fuck it.
I'm going back to the cabin.

669
00:59:04,187 --> 00:59:06,408
- What the hell for?
- I don't know.

670
00:59:06,450 --> 00:59:07,757
Check the truck.

671
00:59:07,799 --> 00:59:09,977
There might be keys in there.
Heather.

672
00:59:10,019 --> 00:59:12,066
- Huh?
- Can I take the buggy?

673
00:59:12,108 --> 00:59:14,198
- Knock yourself out, kid.
- Great.

674
00:59:59,024 --> 01:00:00,330
Shit.

675
01:00:21,438 --> 01:00:22,918
Mrs. Brunel?

676
01:00:37,497 --> 01:00:39,064
Hello?

677
01:01:58,274 --> 01:02:00,147
The fuck...?

678
01:04:45,963 --> 01:04:48,097
She's dead... Edna.

679
01:04:48,139 --> 01:04:51,448
Something is wrong.
We have to get out of here.

680
01:04:51,490 --> 01:04:54,582
- D!
- Yeah, I heard you.

681
01:04:54,624 --> 01:04:56,801
She's what?

682
01:04:56,843 --> 01:04:58,586
She's killed herself.

683
01:04:58,628 --> 01:05:01,806
Shit. That's fucked up.

684
01:05:01,848 --> 01:05:05,287
I saw these drawings,
these diagrams and stuff.

685
01:05:09,987 --> 01:05:14,906
Heather, Edna... she's dead.

686
01:05:14,948 --> 01:05:17,474
It's terrible.

687
01:05:17,516 --> 01:05:19,257
God is so fucked.

688
01:05:20,737 --> 01:05:22,001
We need to leave.

689
01:05:22,043 --> 01:05:24,090
That thing...

690
01:05:24,132 --> 01:05:25,700
it's not safe.

691
01:05:25,742 --> 01:05:27,657
What's it got to do with him?

692
01:05:29,267 --> 01:05:32,968
Okay. I saw...

693
01:05:33,010 --> 01:05:34,316
I saw a drawing.

694
01:05:37,841 --> 01:05:39,670
A drawing?

695
01:05:39,712 --> 01:05:41,542
Yeah.

696
01:05:41,584 --> 01:05:44,762
Once the phones are working,
we'll call someone for help.

697
01:05:44,804 --> 01:05:46,980
Yeah, definitely.

698
01:05:49,287 --> 01:05:51,160
God.

699
01:05:51,202 --> 01:05:52,422
It's so sad.

700
01:05:52,464 --> 01:05:53,858
It's really sad.

701
01:06:35,290 --> 01:06:37,467
What are you?

702
01:08:16,608 --> 01:08:17,915
What the fuck is it?!

703
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:21,831
You went in the room.

704
01:08:24,094 --> 01:08:27,011
What the fuck is it?

705
01:08:27,053 --> 01:08:30,014
I'm not sure, but...

706
01:08:30,056 --> 01:08:32,408
it's something really special.

707
01:08:32,450 --> 01:08:34,628
- We need to call someone.
- Like who?

708
01:08:34,670 --> 01:08:36,978
Like the cops
or other government.

709
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:40,111
Whoa. And what do you think
they're going to do with it?

710
01:08:40,153 --> 01:08:42,984
They're going to take it.
That's what.

711
01:08:43,026 --> 01:08:45,507
- And it's ours.
- She's right, Charles.

712
01:08:48,553 --> 01:08:51,035
I think it's an alien.

713
01:08:51,077 --> 01:08:54,125
I mean,
if it is an actual alien,

714
01:08:54,167 --> 01:08:57,912
like, really like some
extraterrestrial shit,

715
01:08:57,954 --> 01:09:02,046
then the first thing
we need to do is lawyer up.

716
01:09:02,088 --> 01:09:04,614
The fuck? Heather?

717
01:09:04,656 --> 01:09:06,399
You're the one
that wanted to keep it.

718
01:09:06,441 --> 01:09:09,489
Imagine how much
an alien is worth.

719
01:09:09,531 --> 01:09:11,839
I mean, asides from the PR,

720
01:09:11,881 --> 01:09:14,972
and obviously porn.

721
01:09:15,014 --> 01:09:16,278
This is insane.

722
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:17,975
You come across something
like this

723
01:09:18,017 --> 01:09:20,239
and all you could think about
is how much it's worth?

724
01:09:20,281 --> 01:09:22,328
This is America.

725
01:09:22,370 --> 01:09:25,766
- It might be dangerous.
- Bullshit.

726
01:09:25,808 --> 01:09:27,071
You just want to give it up.

727
01:09:27,113 --> 01:09:28,682
You and your hippie
bleeding heart

728
01:09:28,724 --> 01:09:30,727
are not going to fuck
this up for us.

729
01:09:30,769 --> 01:09:34,688
Heather, the thing...
now it's ours, right?

730
01:09:34,730 --> 01:09:36,559
- Heather?
- Right.

731
01:09:36,601 --> 01:09:38,692
She's right, Charles.

732
01:09:38,734 --> 01:09:42,261
I mean, this is a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

733
01:09:42,303 --> 01:09:44,741
I feel amazing, like really...

734
01:09:44,783 --> 01:09:46,961
I feel like I can just do
anything, you know?

735
01:09:47,003 --> 01:09:49,268
Something really special,
and, I mean, you found it.

736
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:52,793
- Wefound it.
- Right. We found it.

737
01:09:52,835 --> 01:09:57,406
- But Charles saved it originally.
- Yeah, sure. Sure, absolutely.

738
01:09:57,448 --> 01:09:59,756
I mean, it's a three-way split
on, uh, any of the like...

739
01:09:59,798 --> 01:10:01,410
Profits, dividends, shares.

740
01:10:01,452 --> 01:10:03,107
And my dad can definitely help.

741
01:10:03,149 --> 01:10:05,371
Right. I'm sure Schoze
knows people, too.

742
01:10:05,413 --> 01:10:08,633
I mean, this is B-I-G.

743
01:10:09,808 --> 01:10:11,464
What if it's dangerous?

744
01:10:11,506 --> 01:10:13,553
I think Edna knew something,

745
01:10:13,595 --> 01:10:17,296
- and now she's dead.
- Un-fucking-related.

746
01:10:17,338 --> 01:10:20,037
Some ancient Looney Tunes bitch
blows her brains out

747
01:10:20,079 --> 01:10:23,040
and you want to give up like a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity?

748
01:10:23,082 --> 01:10:26,392
I told you. I told you she'd
try and fuck this up for us.

749
01:10:26,434 --> 01:10:29,917
You're crazy, D. Like,
you've really fucking flipped.

750
01:10:29,959 --> 01:10:32,833
No, Charlotte, you'recrazy.

751
01:10:32,875 --> 01:10:36,619
You find an alien and you want
to fucking give it away?!

752
01:10:36,661 --> 01:10:41,102
No, no, no, no, no.
No fucking way!

753
01:10:41,144 --> 01:10:43,496
This is so typical of you,
Charlotte.

754
01:10:43,538 --> 01:10:45,019
You get an opportunity like this

755
01:10:45,061 --> 01:10:47,500
and you just can't help yourself
but fuck it up.

756
01:10:47,542 --> 01:10:50,764
There is a reason you work in
a pet shop for a minimum wage.

757
01:10:50,806 --> 01:10:52,983
Well, you're not fucking
this up for us. No, you're not.

758
01:10:53,025 --> 01:10:54,202
D.

759
01:10:54,244 --> 01:10:55,812
You were always like this,
Charles.

760
01:10:55,854 --> 01:10:58,249
- Even at school, you were weak.
- D, what the fuck?

761
01:10:58,291 --> 01:10:59,599
You've got no killer instinct.

762
01:10:59,641 --> 01:11:00,643
Something like this lands
on your plate,

763
01:11:00,685 --> 01:11:02,079
and you want to call the cops?

764
01:11:02,121 --> 01:11:04,343
Fuck the police,
we're keeping it!

765
01:11:04,385 --> 01:11:06,301
- Deidre!
- What?!

766
01:11:06,343 --> 01:11:07,824
What the fuck is that?

767
01:11:28,147 --> 01:11:31,195
What the fuck?!

768
01:11:31,237 --> 01:11:33,328
Oh, my God!

769
01:11:33,370 --> 01:11:36,287
Oh, God! Oh, God!
Oh, God! Oh, God!

770
01:11:40,638 --> 01:11:43,773
- This is yourfault!
- What?

771
01:11:43,815 --> 01:11:46,950
You brought that thing
in the house, you stupid bitch!

772
01:11:46,992 --> 01:11:49,605
- What the fuck?
- I mean, how...?

773
01:11:49,647 --> 01:11:51,128
What...?

774
01:11:51,170 --> 01:11:54,610
Not good. Not good.

775
01:11:54,652 --> 01:11:56,132
D...

776
01:11:57,350 --> 01:11:58,614
...your eyes.

777
01:12:06,838 --> 01:12:08,407
What the...?

778
01:12:37,042 --> 01:12:38,611
Oh, my God.

779
01:12:40,393 --> 01:12:41,440
Oh, my God.

780
01:12:47,270 --> 01:12:51,275
- It burns!
- It burns! It burns!

781
01:12:53,406 --> 01:12:56,019
It burns! It burns!

782
01:13:03,199 --> 01:13:04,898
Help me!

783
01:13:18,083 --> 01:13:19,565
Oh, my God.

784
01:13:22,740 --> 01:13:24,700
You motherfucker.

785
01:13:51,943 --> 01:13:54,730
What have you done to them?

786
01:13:54,772 --> 01:13:56,297
I swear to God,

787
01:13:56,339 --> 01:13:57,907
I will kill you!

788
01:13:57,949 --> 01:14:00,301
I will kill you!

789
01:14:20,450 --> 01:14:21,975
D? D?

790
01:15:26,342 --> 01:15:28,911
Why?

791
01:19:05,039 --> 01:19:06,389
Heather?

792
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:15,877
Heather.

793
01:19:15,919 --> 01:19:18,532
I'm sorry.

794
01:19:20,054 --> 01:19:21,927
Aah!

795
01:21:28,704 --> 01:21:30,620
Deidre! Please!

796
01:22:08,222 --> 01:22:09,746
What the fuck?

797
01:22:44,736 --> 01:22:45,913
I'm sorry.

798
01:23:07,890 --> 01:23:10,327
Miss?
Miss, are you okay?

799
01:23:11,937 --> 01:23:14,811
That crazy bitch
was gonna kill you.

800
01:23:14,853 --> 01:23:16,726
We gotta get you
to the hospital.

801
01:26:55,944 --> 01:27:00,689
I feel... amazing.

802
01:27:14,789 --> 01:27:16,183
I'm sorry, D.

803
01:28:18,361 --> 01:28:22,158
