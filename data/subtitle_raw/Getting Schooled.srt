1
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:19,671
Well hello, little lady.

2
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:23,575
Lemme guess.
Detention, right?

3
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:26,011
Yeah. Totally bogus.

4
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:33,318
Um...

5
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,988
I've-I've gotta pee
really bad.

6
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:39,658
Kids today.

7
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,560
I used to love detention.

8
00:02:41,562 --> 00:02:42,961
Pick up chicks.

9
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,597
Some of them had to pee also.

10
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:52,037
Someone stayed up too late
watching mtv.

11
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:00,179
I got places to be.

12
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:02,114
Not.

13
00:03:02,116 --> 00:03:03,815
Like where?

14
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:05,150
Take a bath?

15
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:06,718
Hold that, Princess.

16
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,555
Stop it, stop it, stop it!

17
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:12,591
Ouch! Gag me!

18
00:03:14,495 --> 00:03:17,663
Oh, my god.
Who's that, y'all?

19
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:26,872
Who are you?

20
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:29,274
Call me Mr. roker, tough guy.

21
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:35,747
Everybody sit.

22
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:38,250
Boy, girl, boy, girl.

23
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:41,353
And girl.

24
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:49,761
Close the door.

25
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,639
Mike swank?

26
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:02,074
Yeah?

27
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:04,142
Just say "here", meathead.

28
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:05,344
Here.

29
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,113
Hillary Miller.

30
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:15,454
As if!
Here.

31
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:18,390
Rusty Boone?

32
00:04:18,392 --> 00:04:19,925
Yo.

33
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:22,561
- Shelly hinson.
- Here, sir.

34
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:25,163
Julie Moore.

35
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,841
Aren't we a fine looking bunch?

36
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,545
From the looks of you, i imagine
you already know the rules.

37
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:42,447
No talking,

38
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:44,283
keep to yourselves,

39
00:04:44,285 --> 00:04:46,184
and no one, and I mean no one,

40
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:48,086
leaves this room
without my permission.

41
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:49,688
I can do this
standing on my head, man.

42
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,990
Don't make me
have you prove it, son.

43
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:56,194
You ladies enjoy...

44
00:04:56,196 --> 00:04:58,196
and I'll be back in a bit
to check on you.

45
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,927
How's it going, Princess?

46
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:30,829
Ugh, gross me out!

47
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,497
Why don't you just
leave her alone?

48
00:05:40,307 --> 00:05:41,673
Mm-hmm.

49
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:42,808
That's what I thought.

50
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:45,877
Because you don't mess
with the bionic man.

51
00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:58,123
Loser.

52
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:00,926
Retard.

53
00:06:02,463 --> 00:06:03,795
Dork.

54
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:07,499
Homo.

55
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:09,101
Ooh.

56
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:13,572
Bet she'd do me if I put her
in the school play.

57
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,842
What's this world comin' to?

58
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,279
So what's your story, Princess?

59
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:22,381
Story?

60
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:26,118
Yeah... like, your story.

61
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,321
I think the burnout means
why are you here?

62
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,525
I'll tell you mine
if everyone else tells theirs.

63
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,636
Come on.
What's your damage?

64
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:41,733
Maybe I don't like handing out
my dirty laundry to strangers.

65
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,468
Aw, come on,

66
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,337
we're all friends
here in detention.

67
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:50,409
Yeah, just like
a championship team.

68
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:52,244
Come on,
as if it's that personal.

69
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:53,812
Get real.

70
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,883
Okay.
You go first.

71
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:01,086
Okay, so, me
and my gal pal Brittany

72
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:02,821
were, like, totally
going to Blaze out of class

73
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:04,723
and stand in line
for r.E.O. Speedwagon tickets...

74
00:07:04,725 --> 00:07:06,124
Flamers!

75
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:09,861
Uh, r.E.O. Is totally proper!

76
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:12,297
Anyway...

77
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:14,966
We got busted by that science
guy pulling out of the lot.

78
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:17,969
Totally lame-o.
Can you relate?

79
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:20,806
I can relate to what boner
smokers those guys are.

80
00:07:20,808 --> 00:07:23,208
R.E.O. Homowagon.

81
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:39,858
What about you, four-eyes?

82
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,827
My name is Shelly.

83
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:44,729
- Ooh.
- Okay.

84
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:50,769
Let's just say
i had a little run-in

85
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:55,140
with someone who was...
Touching my property.

86
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:56,708
Property?

87
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,844
Like, they touched you
where you pee?

88
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:04,816
Sorry.
Don't have a heart attack.

89
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,618
Will you just let her talk?

90
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,919
What was it?

91
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,389
My rubik's cube.

92
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:13,492
Whoa! Those are so...

93
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:14,893
zeeked.

94
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:16,027
Huh?

95
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:17,629
Bunk?

96
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:19,431
Ill? Mung?

97
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:21,967
Uncool.

98
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:24,703
Not more uncool
than r.E.O. Whateverwagon.

99
00:08:29,644 --> 00:08:30,543
Wait.

100
00:08:30,544 --> 00:08:34,880
So you raged on some scumbag
for touching your blocks?

101
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:54,699
It's Hillary, right?

102
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:55,934
Mm-hmm.

103
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:57,569
Go shut the door.

104
00:08:57,571 --> 00:08:58,637
Ugh!

105
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:02,908
Where'd you go?

106
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,912
Get your tires rotated?

107
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:11,783
Stupid.

108
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:14,719
So you're
a real go-getter, huh?

109
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:19,157
You gonna roll me
over to the office, Mr. roboto?

110
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:20,525
No...

111
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:22,160
but I am gonna roll
all over you.

112
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,730
Shut up, geekette!

113
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,466
Don't you people
have anything better to do

114
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:32,203
on a Saturday morning
than sit here with a cripple?

115
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:33,772
Don't you have friends?

116
00:09:33,774 --> 00:09:35,307
The freak doesn't.

117
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:38,476
Meet the only friend
i need, jocko.

118
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:40,412
Bring me the knife, Mr. Boone.

119
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,950
Why don't you come over here
and get it?

120
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:48,653
Ugh.

121
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,656
I hope you brought a spare tire.

122
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:46,378
Seeing that you all have
an obvious learning disability,

123
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,580
I'll write the rules
on the board.

124
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:52,917
Oh!

125
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:59,324
It hit him right in the face!

126
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:00,525
Yes!

127
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:02,827
Dumbass.

128
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:07,465
- Oh, my god.
- Mister?

129
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:09,567
Mr. roker, are you okay?

130
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:11,236
Mister?

131
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:13,371
Oh, shit.

132
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:14,839
Is he breathing?

133
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,474
Mr. roker?

134
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:17,476
Shit.

135
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,631
I think I hear him breathing.

136
00:11:39,633 --> 00:11:41,113
It's actually
more of a wheeze than...

137
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:42,967
Shit!

138
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:46,004
- Sh...
- You tried to kill me!

139
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:49,941
You gook bastards!

140
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,047
No!

141
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,916
Let him go! No!

142
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:03,888
Killer!

143
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:08,126
Damnit, I'm not touching him!

144
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:09,594
Rusty!

145
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:12,130
Let him go!

146
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,034
She just hit him!

147
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:25,276
Thanks a lot, bimbette.

148
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:29,080
I don't wanna touch you, dweeb!

149
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,856
We got trouble.

150
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:40,558
He's got trouble for sure.

151
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:42,961
You think they're
gonna believe us,

152
00:12:42,963 --> 00:12:44,696
or a teacher in a wheelchair?

153
00:12:44,698 --> 00:12:46,898
They?
What do you mean by they?

154
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,200
Police. Parents. Society?

155
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:51,102
We just assaulted a teacher
as far as they're concerned.

156
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,170
He said we tried to kill him.

157
00:12:52,172 --> 00:12:54,272
No, you assaulted the teacher.

158
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:55,673
You tried to kill him!

159
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:57,776
And we watched, asshole!

160
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:00,779
It's called being
an ass-cessory, joystick.

161
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:02,981
I'm not gonna get busted
for this.

162
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:05,083
This is hellacious.

163
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:10,021
My dad... will kill me for real

164
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:12,357
if this messes with me
starting the next game.

165
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,627
Don't have a cow.

166
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:17,796
Let's tie him up.

167
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:18,798
What?

168
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:22,367
What? We can talk to him
when he catches snap.

169
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:26,371
Uh...

170
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:29,674
He tried to friggin' kill me.

171
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:32,343
It's a fantastic idea.

172
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:34,012
Where are we gonna
get rope from?

173
00:13:34,014 --> 00:13:35,547
Fine, okay...

174
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,749
Yeah.

175
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:39,484
They're boys,
they can do the rope stuff.

176
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,953
I don't... it's not...
I'm just the idea person.

177
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:43,454
Well, I was a girl scout.

178
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:46,024
Let's go jocko, get some rope.

179
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,379
So...

180
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:09,814
What do we do now?

181
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:14,052
Wait until he wakes up.
Reason with him.

182
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:19,591
Did you hear that major
crazy shit he was talking?

183
00:14:19,593 --> 00:14:23,494
Man, we're all in more trouble
than I wanna even think about.

184
00:14:23,496 --> 00:14:25,864
Hell, I'm not even
supposed to be here.

185
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:27,098
I'm the good kid.

186
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,501
I ought to be home
working on my science project.

187
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:32,036
Uh, just say no.

188
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,705
I should be out
buying my prom dress.

189
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:35,673
Instead I'm stuck here
with you posers.

190
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:36,875
Can it, miss America.

191
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:38,843
Everybody had something better
to do today.

192
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:41,312
I could be out busting heads
on the field.

193
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:45,183
I could be home right now.

194
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:48,686
What would you be doing?

195
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:50,922
Crimes.

196
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,558
What was he yelling about,
anyway?

197
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:57,662
Probably gibberish.

198
00:14:57,664 --> 00:15:00,398
I think part of it
was vietnamese.

199
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,966
How the hell would you know?

200
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:04,302
Uh, whatever.

201
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:08,439
What's he doing
in that wheelchair anyway?

202
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:18,449
Ladies! Come on!

203
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:21,019
We need to figure out
what to do before he wakes up.

204
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:23,254
Uh... too late.

205
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,496
Uh... hi.

206
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,266
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.
It's just that...

207
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:37,335
Do you remember what happened?

208
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,339
Shelly's gonna take a look
at you.

209
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:43,474
I don't want to.

210
00:15:43,476 --> 00:15:45,076
Do it...

211
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:46,611
or I'll call the police myself.

212
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:49,213
Okay, don't have a cow.
Just give me two seconds.

213
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:59,223
What the hell are you doing?

214
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,997
Hey!

215
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:07,465
Hey!

216
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,000
Just go!

217
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:12,737
Shelly!

218
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:15,039
I'm gathering my chi.

219
00:16:17,911 --> 00:16:20,111
If I watch this
am I gonna be a flamer?

220
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:21,212
Yeah.

221
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,119
Fuckin' do it already!

222
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:35,960
- Okay.
- Come on! Do it!

223
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:45,069
It's a little bruised.

224
00:16:45,071 --> 00:16:48,473
You have to press around it.
Gag me.

225
00:16:48,475 --> 00:16:49,874
Do you wanna do it?

226
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:57,815
Are you okay?

227
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:02,387
It hurts further back.

228
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:03,821
Be careful.

229
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:06,224
Further back.

230
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:23,041
Oh, barf me out!
What is wrong with you?!

231
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:25,610
Gross!

232
00:17:25,612 --> 00:17:27,111
You're a dick, man!

233
00:17:28,615 --> 00:17:31,182
- He bit me!
- You're in time out, speed racer.

234
00:17:31,184 --> 00:17:32,517
Get the door. Move!

235
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,919
Come on!

236
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:36,220
It's like shark teeth.

237
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:37,455
God, you're heavy.

238
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:46,597
Shut up!

239
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:48,466
Stupid kids.

240
00:17:53,006 --> 00:17:54,872
Ah, ouch.

241
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:59,143
It hurts.

242
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:05,583
Okay.

243
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:08,653
So now we add taking a hostage
to the list of offenses.

244
00:18:08,655 --> 00:18:11,255
Oh, it's "we" now?

245
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:12,890
Yes, we.
We...

246
00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:14,325
Let's just figure this out!

247
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:19,997
I've been thinking about this.

248
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:21,499
Oh, here we go.

249
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:26,003
The men are talking.

250
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:28,439
We need to make sure
no one gets in here

251
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,907
until we figure this shit out.

252
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:32,477
We need to call the police.
We are totally innocent.

253
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:33,911
They're not gonna believe us!

254
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:36,747
At least not until Mr. roboto
comes to his senses.

255
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:38,282
What's your big idea, then?

256
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:40,251
We gotta lock down the school.

257
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:42,587
Lock it down?

258
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:45,256
No one can see him.
He's in the closet.

259
00:18:45,258 --> 00:18:47,358
What if somebody walks in
and he starts shouting?

260
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,893
What then, huh?

261
00:18:48,895 --> 00:18:51,062
I can't believe this, but...

262
00:18:51,064 --> 00:18:53,998
i agree with a kid
that wears a leather jacket.

263
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,433
Any volunteers?

264
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:59,904
- Mm-mm.
- All right. Jocko, I guess we...

265
00:18:59,906 --> 00:19:03,474
Uh... I'll take Julie with me.

266
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,109
You just watch that door.

267
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:07,678
Fine.

268
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,149
Hey, why don't you come up here
with me?

269
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:18,890
I think he's gone insane.
What are we gonna do?

270
00:19:18,892 --> 00:19:21,359
Follow the plan.
Lock it down.

271
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:23,895
Every door and window?
That's impossible.

272
00:19:23,897 --> 00:19:25,363
Nothing's impossible.

273
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:28,032
Man, you are a mess.

274
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,369
You're so pretty.

275
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:35,973
You think they know?

276
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:39,577
They would never...

277
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:45,216
I love you.

278
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:46,684
I love you too.

279
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:49,520
Aw, young love.

280
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:53,558
Kinda takes me back to my youth.

281
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:00,932
'Scuse me.
You guys have a hall pass?

282
00:20:00,934 --> 00:20:03,201
- We really have to go...
- Yeah, we gotta go.

283
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:06,370
Look, we just gotta go.
That's all.

284
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:08,039
Kids of today.

285
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,007
You just wonder what's
going through their minds.

286
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:11,242
You know...

287
00:20:11,244 --> 00:20:12,977
Probably sex...

288
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:15,346
more sex...

289
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:16,847
sex again...

290
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:18,082
Did I say sex?

291
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:20,017
That's included: Sex.

292
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,686
We can't let them catch on.

293
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:32,223
Yeah, they'll rag us to death,
but...

294
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:35,359
i don't really care
what anyone thinks.

295
00:21:35,361 --> 00:21:36,794
I do.

296
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:39,297
You can't be seen
with an outcast like me.

297
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:41,332
What if your dad...

298
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:07,024
You two look like
you've been boinking.

299
00:22:07,026 --> 00:22:09,593
Ugh! Grotesque!

300
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,597
Ha ha!

301
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:16,867
Nobody's getting in here today.

302
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:18,703
This place is locked down
like my offensive line.

303
00:22:18,705 --> 00:22:20,638
Boo bam!
- Ta-da!

304
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,040
Mr roker's wallet, anyone?

305
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:32,583
Look what we have here.

306
00:22:32,585 --> 00:22:34,852
Mr. roker's résumé.

307
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:36,153
Mm...

308
00:22:36,155 --> 00:22:39,490
Couple of private
security contract jobs.

309
00:22:39,492 --> 00:22:42,059
Hm. No teaching jobs.

310
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,401
Fucking queer!

311
00:22:50,403 --> 00:22:51,836
Veteran card.

312
00:22:51,838 --> 00:22:53,537
Couple of tours in Vietnam
I'll bet.

313
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:55,940
That's where the gibberish
came from.

314
00:22:55,942 --> 00:22:57,408
Gnarly.

315
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:59,143
Know what that card is?

316
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,846
He was in black ops!

317
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,615
What does that mean?

318
00:23:05,117 --> 00:23:06,784
Oh, Jesus Christ.

319
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,955
That means he's a bad, bad man.

320
00:23:12,692 --> 00:23:14,592
I wanna call my parents.

321
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:17,461
What if we just tell him
what we know?

322
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:21,732
- Read it to him, outcast.
- What? Why me?

323
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:23,033
I think the sound
of a woman's voice

324
00:23:23,035 --> 00:23:25,369
might rush the blood
from his head to his...

325
00:23:25,371 --> 00:23:26,537
What?

326
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:39,750
Uh, Mr. roker,

327
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:44,255
we know you were in
the, um, black ops.

328
00:23:44,257 --> 00:23:46,357
You were also in Vietnam.

329
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:47,892
Do you remember?

330
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:51,829
Mr. roker,
do you remember this?

331
00:23:51,831 --> 00:23:53,464
You think he's dead?

332
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:56,000
There's only one way
to find out.

333
00:23:56,902 --> 00:23:58,335
We gotta open that door.

334
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:00,905
Hey, hey, hang on a second!

335
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:08,078
If he comes after us, man,
I'm totally gonna sack him.

336
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,313
Fuckin' a.

337
00:24:12,985 --> 00:24:14,251
Come on.

338
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,187
Watch out, Princess.

339
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:19,190
Ready?
- Yeah, yeah.

340
00:24:19,192 --> 00:24:20,324
One...

341
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:23,394
- Sorry.
- One...

342
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:25,162
two...

343
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:28,265
three!

344
00:24:28,267 --> 00:24:29,267
Shit.

345
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:31,569
- Where's the beef?
- - Oh, my god, guys.

346
00:24:31,571 --> 00:24:33,137
What's wrong?

347
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:35,272
What's it say?

348
00:24:35,274 --> 00:24:37,541
How did he climb up
and into the ceiling?

349
00:24:37,543 --> 00:24:39,577
- What's it say?
- - What's it say?

350
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:42,546
"Game on. You die."

351
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:47,585
Oh, my god.

352
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:10,741
Is, uh...

353
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,310
everything okay, there,

354
00:25:13,312 --> 00:25:15,312
mister, uh...

355
00:25:15,314 --> 00:25:17,081
- Roker.
- Roker.

356
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:20,584
Um...

357
00:25:20,586 --> 00:25:21,886
I'm, uh...

358
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,988
watching detention.

359
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,789
I-i don't feel so well.

360
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:27,558
What's the matter, buddy?

361
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,326
I'm not sure. I know...

362
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:32,730
i threw up...

363
00:25:32,732 --> 00:25:36,700
I... wonder if I could
borrow a mop.

364
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:39,737
I got plenty of mops here,
but...

365
00:25:39,739 --> 00:25:41,438
it's my job to clean up.

366
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:45,609
I can see you're eating.

367
00:25:45,611 --> 00:25:46,810
Hey, I...

368
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:48,679
I won't tell.

369
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,415
Very considerate of you.

370
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:54,518
Don't wanna take your job...

371
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,791
but I will take your life!

372
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:36,327
Little bubbly?

373
00:26:36,329 --> 00:26:38,195
Huh? Huh?

374
00:26:38,197 --> 00:26:40,864
Drink it down.
There you go!

375
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:17,534
I wanna go home!

376
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:20,471
The pigs are gonna be
all over me for this,

377
00:27:20,473 --> 00:27:22,539
and I ain't going down alone!

378
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:25,809
I guess the mall maggot is
going to sit there and bawl?

379
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:27,378
Why don't you just
leave her alone?

380
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,779
I'm tired of you
opening your mouth...

381
00:27:28,781 --> 00:27:31,382
- nobody was talking to you, outcast.
- I'm talking to you.

382
00:27:31,384 --> 00:27:33,484
I'm not an outcast!
- Why don't you turn your head...

383
00:27:33,486 --> 00:27:35,886
- I'm not gonna turn around. - ...And
cut yourself a little bit, huh?

384
00:27:35,888 --> 00:27:38,122
It's none of your concern,
so shut up!

385
00:27:38,124 --> 00:27:40,457
Oh, you don't talk all year and now you
are gonna turn around and bitch at me?

386
00:27:40,459 --> 00:27:41,892
I'm gonna bitch at you
all I want!

387
00:27:41,894 --> 00:27:44,194
Let's not be afraid.

388
00:27:44,196 --> 00:27:46,764
Fear is the mind killer.

389
00:27:48,267 --> 00:27:52,503
Fear is the little-death
that brings total obliteration.

390
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:55,539
Just let her go with it, man.

391
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:58,008
And when it has gone past,

392
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:02,713
I will turn the inner eye
to see its path.

393
00:28:02,715 --> 00:28:06,717
Where the fear has gone...
There will be nothing.

394
00:28:06,719 --> 00:28:09,153
Only I will remain!

395
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:13,090
Wow. Righteous speech.

396
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:23,967
I knew reading "dune" would
come in handy at some point.

397
00:28:35,781 --> 00:28:38,716
Is that blood on your head?

398
00:28:38,718 --> 00:28:40,451
I don't think
i can take it anymore.

399
00:28:40,453 --> 00:28:41,919
Take what anymore?

400
00:28:41,921 --> 00:28:44,855
War, you gook!

401
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:50,728
You and your kind followed us
for three days in the bush

402
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:53,130
while we were trying to find
the rest of our company.

403
00:28:57,368 --> 00:28:58,936
Listen!

404
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:02,940
You are going to listen.

405
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:07,611
We found evidence of 'em.

406
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:13,150
Our provisions were running low.

407
00:29:13,152 --> 00:29:15,486
Some of the men turned to...

408
00:29:20,992 --> 00:29:23,026
You know what I mean!

409
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,564
You commanded your...

410
00:29:27,566 --> 00:29:31,401
little yellow bastards
to kill them, and...

411
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:48,385
It all started
when we ran across this...

412
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,421
this little village...

413
00:29:51,423 --> 00:29:53,590
that had been napalmed
hours before.

414
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:58,395
For miles it was all
anyone could talk about.

415
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,399
That smell...

416
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:06,336
It was enough to drive
some of the...

417
00:30:06,338 --> 00:30:08,272
weaker mean insane.

418
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:13,277
One of my men...

419
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:18,849
rushed up...
To a smoldering body...

420
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,921
didn't hesitate for a second...

421
00:30:23,923 --> 00:30:26,056
After that it was a frenzy.

422
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:30,794
I'm not finished...

423
00:30:30,796 --> 00:30:31,962
general.

424
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:40,504
When we got back to base...

425
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:42,472
some of the men were arrested.

426
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:48,078
They were found
cooking human flesh.

427
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:55,552
Oh, I don't have to tell you...

428
00:30:57,323 --> 00:30:58,622
taste.

429
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:05,963
It was in 'em...

430
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,835
It was in 'em, all right.

431
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:15,272
Like their conscience laid bare.

432
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:20,177
I have walked through the valley

433
00:31:20,179 --> 00:31:22,412
of the shadow of death!

434
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:25,015
And it smelled...

435
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,751
delicious!

436
00:31:34,425 --> 00:31:37,094
You're gonna tell me
where my men are, general...

437
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,930
now.

438
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:42,733
Let's hunt
that mental fuck down.

439
00:31:42,735 --> 00:31:45,535
Yes! Yes!

440
00:31:45,537 --> 00:31:47,938
He wants blood?
Let's give it to him, man.

441
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:50,908
Fuck yes!

442
00:31:55,848 --> 00:31:57,681
<i>Attention, students.</i>

443
00:31:57,683 --> 00:32:00,450
<i>All of you little brats
are gonna pay.</i>

444
00:32:00,452 --> 00:32:02,753
<i>I'll be wearing your ears
as a necklace</i>

445
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:04,755
<i>before the final bell.</i>

446
00:32:04,757 --> 00:32:06,757
<i>That is all.</i>

447
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:08,692
Let's get out of here!

448
00:32:08,694 --> 00:32:10,627
Come on, come on, guys.
No fake.

449
00:32:10,629 --> 00:32:12,296
We have to go...
- hey, hey, hey!

450
00:32:12,298 --> 00:32:13,830
Chill out.
All right?

451
00:32:13,832 --> 00:32:17,200
We just gotta make sure lieutenant
lunatic doesn't get in here.

452
00:32:17,202 --> 00:32:19,736
We have to find something
to block the doors.

453
00:32:19,738 --> 00:32:21,338
Duh!

454
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,506
Let's go!

455
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:25,575
Get the cabinet!

456
00:32:25,577 --> 00:32:27,077
Forget the cabinet!
Move the trash can!

457
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:28,979
That's never gonna hold, moron!

458
00:32:28,981 --> 00:32:30,347
Shut up!

459
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:33,650
That has wheels, asshole!

460
00:32:33,652 --> 00:32:35,352
- Hit me again.
- Get the goddamn...

461
00:32:35,354 --> 00:32:37,087
Hit me again, bro!

462
00:32:37,089 --> 00:32:38,789
Come on! Come on!

463
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:40,490
Come on! Come on! Come on!

464
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:48,865
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

465
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:52,836
How's that?
Mega-touchdown!

466
00:32:52,838 --> 00:32:54,838
Just what we needed he-man!

467
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,841
Ow... ow...
Just kidding! You suck!

468
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,478
How are we supposed to get out?

469
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,446
As long as he can't get in,

470
00:33:02,448 --> 00:33:04,348
I don't give a shit
about getting out.

471
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:08,251
I am not your b.F.F.

472
00:33:26,537 --> 00:33:27,537
Ah!

473
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:29,539
I can get it for you.

474
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:31,675
I can get you all the money
that you need.

475
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:34,011
I don't care
about those little brats.

476
00:33:34,013 --> 00:33:35,645
Just let me go.

477
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,414
Let me go!

478
00:33:38,684 --> 00:33:41,018
Promises, promises!

479
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,219
Hey!

480
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,936
Could use a smoke.

481
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,707
Hey, you can't smoke that
in here.

482
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:05,942
You have to go
to the smoking area.

483
00:34:05,944 --> 00:34:07,177
Get real.

484
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:10,080
I think that is the least
of our problems.

485
00:34:10,082 --> 00:34:12,182
You smoke dicks, I smoke cigs.

486
00:34:12,184 --> 00:34:13,517
Ha!

487
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:14,951
You want one?

488
00:34:14,953 --> 00:34:17,020
I want to get out of here.

489
00:34:18,023 --> 00:34:20,624
You've made that
abundantly clear.

490
00:34:20,626 --> 00:34:22,526
Ooh, abundantly, huh?

491
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:27,330
I could be like you...

492
00:34:27,332 --> 00:34:29,166
if I wanted to.

493
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:31,034
Yeah, right.

494
00:34:31,036 --> 00:34:32,736
What's your score on your sats?

495
00:34:33,972 --> 00:34:35,672
A lot.

496
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:39,976
I bet mine was higher.

497
00:34:39,978 --> 00:34:42,212
Bet you were just high
when you took it.

498
00:34:43,782 --> 00:34:46,283
- He was. I was there.
- Come on. Humor me.

499
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:50,754
1420.

500
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,860
That's pretty good.

501
00:34:58,229 --> 00:35:00,397
Yes? So?

502
00:35:00,399 --> 00:35:02,132
Why don't you humor us?

503
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:05,936
1500.

504
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:08,939
Bullshit!

505
00:35:08,941 --> 00:35:10,941
Bullshit, and I'm calling
you out right now.

506
00:35:10,943 --> 00:35:12,309
Whatever.

507
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:17,147
Ah!

508
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:18,949
What are we betting?

509
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:21,151
What? Nothing.

510
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:24,855
How 'bout the Princess
let's me French her?

511
00:35:27,825 --> 00:35:31,161
And if I win, you have to apologize
to all of us for being rude!

512
00:35:31,163 --> 00:35:32,562
Yes!

513
00:35:32,564 --> 00:35:35,332
If you scored a 1500 on the sat,

514
00:35:35,334 --> 00:35:36,533
I'll let you bag me.

515
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:52,449
No way! No way!
Let me see that shit!

516
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:58,321
Fuckin' a, dude!
Are you serious?

517
00:35:58,323 --> 00:36:00,423
You want some gum, Princess?

518
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:02,626
Damn!

519
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:07,330
So, do you want
some privacy, or...?

520
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:09,399
Let's just get this over with.

521
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:13,270
This is actually happening
right now.

522
00:36:13,272 --> 00:36:15,972
You said anything I wanted.

523
00:36:15,974 --> 00:36:18,008
You're not a liar are you?
- Fine.

524
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:25,215
Texas thunder light
would make this a lot easier.

525
00:36:25,217 --> 00:36:27,350
Yeah, let's get some privacy.

526
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:33,056
- How is this happening?
- Later days and better days, suckers!

527
00:36:33,058 --> 00:36:34,291
What?!

528
00:36:35,092 --> 00:36:36,860
What does that even mean?

529
00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:42,699
Oh, oh my god.

530
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:44,467
Is it safe in here?

531
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,605
Listen if you're scared...
We don't have to do this.

532
00:36:52,643 --> 00:36:54,778
You think you're so
bad to the bone.

533
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:01,451
I think it's bogus.

534
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,965
Preppy girls do it best.

535
00:37:14,967 --> 00:37:16,199
Say it.

536
00:37:16,201 --> 00:37:17,334
Prove it.

537
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:27,210
This has been brewing
a long time.

538
00:37:29,014 --> 00:37:30,513
Get real.

539
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,315
Get bent.

540
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:43,126
Just between us?

541
00:37:43,128 --> 00:37:44,394
Oh, yeah.

542
00:38:09,588 --> 00:38:12,922
Principals don't belong here
on Saturday!

543
00:38:27,172 --> 00:38:29,339
That should bleed you out
soon enough.

544
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:43,019
Listen, this is
a long time coming.

545
00:38:43,021 --> 00:38:44,554
To be continued?

546
00:38:44,556 --> 00:38:46,222
In your dreams.

547
00:38:47,124 --> 00:38:48,325
Tease.

548
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:50,794
There's somethin'
out there, man.

549
00:38:50,796 --> 00:38:52,262
Let's go check it out.

550
00:38:57,968 --> 00:38:59,469
Rusty, let's go!

551
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:05,241
Shit, dude, you see that?

552
00:39:09,981 --> 00:39:12,048
Oh, shit! Oh, my god!

553
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:13,383
Close it!

554
00:39:13,385 --> 00:39:14,551
Fuck dude!
- Shit, shit.

555
00:39:14,553 --> 00:39:16,853
- That's janitor Dan!
- Dude, that's fucked up, man!

556
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:17,855
That guy was cool!

557
00:39:19,891 --> 00:39:21,991
Let's go tell the girls.
Let's go.

558
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:28,832
Okay,

559
00:39:28,834 --> 00:39:30,834
he is officially batshit
to the Max!

560
00:39:30,836 --> 00:39:33,169
He butchered janitor Dan!

561
00:39:33,171 --> 00:39:35,205
My balls are in my throat, man,

562
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:36,906
and that tells me we gotta
get the shit out of here.

563
00:39:36,908 --> 00:39:38,108
Can we go home now?

564
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:40,009
I'm with her!
Let's bail!

565
00:39:40,011 --> 00:39:42,011
- Yes!
- Guys, this is not a good idea!

566
00:39:42,013 --> 00:39:43,880
I have a very bad feeling
about this.

567
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:45,148
Guys!

568
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:47,884
Let's stick together.

569
00:39:59,164 --> 00:40:01,631
God, please!
Somebody help us!

570
00:40:03,502 --> 00:40:05,402
Hillary, you can't do this.

571
00:40:05,404 --> 00:40:07,537
We gotta chill and keep moving.
Come on!

572
00:40:07,539 --> 00:40:09,773
It doesn't matter.
We're all going to die anyway.

573
00:40:09,775 --> 00:40:12,609
We will if you don't get up
off your ass!

574
00:40:12,611 --> 00:40:14,210
Oh, shit! Boogie!

575
00:40:21,453 --> 00:40:22,852
Guys!

576
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,287
Damn! You're bohunk, man!

577
00:40:57,289 --> 00:40:59,856
We didn't do all this!

578
00:40:59,858 --> 00:41:01,191
Who, then?

579
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:04,027
My guess is g.I. Joker.

580
00:41:06,163 --> 00:41:07,730
Hey, where's Julie?

581
00:41:09,266 --> 00:41:12,135
- Julie?
- Julie! Where's Julie, man?!

582
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:13,503
- Wait, wait!
- Come back!

583
00:41:13,505 --> 00:41:15,405
Wait! No, no!

584
00:41:22,781 --> 00:41:24,447
Oh, god...

585
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:27,617
Ah...

586
00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:03,186
How could we just leave her?

587
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:05,321
I can't! I can't!
I gotta go back!

588
00:42:05,323 --> 00:42:06,556
Mike!

589
00:42:06,558 --> 00:42:08,224
Ain't happening, bro.

590
00:42:08,226 --> 00:42:10,727
We gotta stick together.

591
00:42:10,729 --> 00:42:12,862
Nobody said "we", wuss!

592
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:14,430
Wait, wait! Wait!

593
00:42:14,432 --> 00:42:15,832
No!

594
00:42:15,834 --> 00:42:17,133
We're sticking together.

595
00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:24,807
Fuck.

596
00:42:26,076 --> 00:42:27,544
Julie?

597
00:42:52,103 --> 00:42:53,303
Julie?

598
00:43:07,586 --> 00:43:10,453
Mike, I'm in here! Mike!

599
00:43:13,157 --> 00:43:14,390
Julie?

600
00:43:18,996 --> 00:43:22,031
So... here we are.

601
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:27,136
Where is she?

602
00:43:27,138 --> 00:43:29,539
Wouldn't you like to know?

603
00:43:29,541 --> 00:43:31,007
Mike!

604
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:34,744
Why don't you go see
if she's okay?!

605
00:43:34,746 --> 00:43:36,346
Man, why don't you go
fuck yourself?

606
00:43:36,348 --> 00:43:38,348
Aah!

607
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:40,149
Soldiers today...

608
00:43:40,151 --> 00:43:42,085
No respect for the enemy!

609
00:43:46,891 --> 00:43:48,858
Oh! Oh!

610
00:43:49,426 --> 00:43:52,261
Oh!

611
00:43:52,263 --> 00:43:53,963
Where'd the tough guy go?

612
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:55,164
Huh?

613
00:43:58,302 --> 00:43:59,969
Mike!

614
00:44:03,007 --> 00:44:05,108
Mike, I'm in here! Mike!

615
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:11,948
Thank you, sir.

616
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:13,449
May I have another?

617
00:44:13,451 --> 00:44:14,584
Mike!

618
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:26,663
Mike!

619
00:44:26,665 --> 00:44:27,764
Are you okay?

620
00:44:27,766 --> 00:44:29,632
I see the breadcrumbs worked.

621
00:44:29,634 --> 00:44:31,701
Big ol' honkin' breadcrumbs.

622
00:44:31,703 --> 00:44:33,036
Come on let's
get you outta here.

623
00:44:33,038 --> 00:44:35,672
- No! No, no, no!

624
00:44:35,674 --> 00:44:37,240
Somebody help!

625
00:44:37,242 --> 00:44:39,275
Somebody help me!

626
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:44,147
Mike, please!
Mike, I love you!

627
00:44:44,149 --> 00:44:46,149
Mike, please!

628
00:44:46,151 --> 00:44:48,384
Mike! Mike!

629
00:44:48,386 --> 00:44:51,554
Oh, my god! Why?!

630
00:44:51,556 --> 00:44:55,725
Why?! Why, why, why, why?!

631
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:08,271
No guts, no glory!

632
00:45:09,774 --> 00:45:11,441
Right, little man?!

633
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,677
You're not half bad, now!

634
00:45:54,885 --> 00:45:56,719
I'm sorry, Julie.

635
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:03,025
Look the only way we're
gonna getting out of here...

636
00:46:03,027 --> 00:46:06,395
is if we kill roker.
We-we know that right?

637
00:46:08,966 --> 00:46:11,667
We see what rushing away
from the group gets us.

638
00:46:14,805 --> 00:46:16,405
He saved my life.

639
00:46:16,407 --> 00:46:17,840
And lost his.

640
00:46:23,114 --> 00:46:25,414
Look, we all have skills.

641
00:46:25,416 --> 00:46:27,316
We need to use them.

642
00:46:28,753 --> 00:46:30,319
You are smart.

643
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:32,855
He's strong.

644
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:36,526
Hillary is... well...

645
00:46:36,528 --> 00:46:39,162
Hillary is a gymnast,
captain of the cheer squad

646
00:46:39,164 --> 00:46:41,164
and a black belt in tae Kwon do.

647
00:46:44,902 --> 00:46:46,435
What's your skill, Julie?

648
00:46:46,437 --> 00:46:48,404
My skills are bogus.

649
00:46:48,406 --> 00:46:51,340
All I know is we need
to get the hell out of here...

650
00:46:51,342 --> 00:46:53,409
and the only way
is over Mr. roker's dead body.

651
00:46:53,411 --> 00:46:56,345
I am a cheerleader.
I'm not gonna kill anyone!

652
00:46:56,347 --> 00:46:58,347
I'm gonna to call the police!

653
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:01,751
The only phone
is in the principal's office.

654
00:47:01,753 --> 00:47:04,153
What about the fire alarms,
did you ever think of that?

655
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:05,655
I didn't think so.

656
00:47:05,657 --> 00:47:08,024
Hillary, chill out, all right?
We gotta wait.

657
00:47:08,026 --> 00:47:09,625
- Hillary!
- Hillary!

658
00:47:09,627 --> 00:47:11,494
- Hillary!
- Hillary!

659
00:47:11,496 --> 00:47:13,162
Hey! Hillary!

660
00:47:13,164 --> 00:47:14,664
Yo, rusty.

661
00:47:14,666 --> 00:47:16,933
We need a plan, okay?

662
00:47:16,935 --> 00:47:20,036
You've got one minute to plan
before I go after her.

663
00:47:20,038 --> 00:47:21,604
You know this is crazy.

664
00:47:21,606 --> 00:47:22,872
I'd do it for you, too, Julie.

665
00:47:22,874 --> 00:47:25,908
You just can't go on a wing
and a prayer.

666
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:29,445
If that's all I got...
It's righteous.

667
00:47:31,182 --> 00:47:35,117
Rusty! Rusty, no!
Rusty!

668
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:57,306
He's the only guy that really
ever cared about me.

669
00:47:58,942 --> 00:48:01,777
I loved him so much.

670
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:10,319
He wanted to tell everybody.

671
00:48:11,154 --> 00:48:13,122
That was the kind of guy he was.

672
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:17,860
But if his dad ever found out
he was dating someone like me,

673
00:48:17,862 --> 00:48:19,729
a freak,

674
00:48:19,731 --> 00:48:21,197
he would've killed him.

675
00:48:25,135 --> 00:48:26,736
And now he's dead

676
00:48:26,738 --> 00:48:30,206
and I have to go into the world and
pretend like i never knew him.

677
00:48:30,208 --> 00:48:32,475
Like I never fucking knew him.

678
00:48:47,357 --> 00:48:49,058
Bite me!

679
00:48:53,463 --> 00:48:54,830
Gross me out!

680
00:48:57,068 --> 00:48:58,134
Ew.

681
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,707
Oh, oh!

682
00:49:05,742 --> 00:49:08,444
Chuh, like, what am I, a hacker?

683
00:49:10,448 --> 00:49:12,248
Shelly will know
how to use this.

684
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:13,849
Ew.

685
00:49:22,759 --> 00:49:26,729
How did you get so far out
in the back country?

686
00:49:26,731 --> 00:49:27,763
Hmm?

687
00:49:30,468 --> 00:49:32,501
You are so kirked out!

688
00:49:32,503 --> 00:49:34,303
What's a pretty little thing
like you doing

689
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:36,172
conniving with the enemy?

690
00:49:40,678 --> 00:49:42,211
You won't get all of us,
you know.

691
00:49:42,213 --> 00:49:44,313
Somebody's gonna get out
and when they do,

692
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:45,681
you're going down.

693
00:49:45,683 --> 00:49:47,183
Oh.

694
00:49:47,185 --> 00:49:49,986
What's daddy's little girl
gonna do now?

695
00:49:49,988 --> 00:49:53,689
Daddy's little girl is gonna
party Hardy on your ass!

696
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,600
Roker!

697
00:50:12,142 --> 00:50:14,810
Not bad for a squaw.

698
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:17,880
You're messing with
the spirit club now, loser.

699
00:50:25,622 --> 00:50:27,790
Ow! Gag me.

700
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:39,969
Die, slant-eye.

701
00:50:45,977 --> 00:50:47,610
Hillary!

702
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:58,687
Ah! Fuck!

703
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:01,490
Hillary!

704
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,531
Hillary!

705
00:51:09,966 --> 00:51:11,133
Where could she be?

706
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:19,875
Hillary!

707
00:51:34,391 --> 00:51:36,859
I just can't let rusty
be alone like that.

708
00:51:38,395 --> 00:51:39,862
Like me.

709
00:51:41,298 --> 00:51:43,332
S-stay here.

710
00:51:43,334 --> 00:51:44,567
Not a problem.

711
00:51:49,172 --> 00:51:50,506
I'll be back.

712
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:23,139
No, no.

713
00:52:46,196 --> 00:52:47,563
No, no.

714
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:07,316
You showed me something today
that... I never knew existed.

715
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:14,857
That son of a bitch!

716
00:53:25,936 --> 00:53:27,169
Rusty?

717
00:53:27,771 --> 00:53:28,804
He killed her.

718
00:53:32,175 --> 00:53:34,176
I wanna kill the fucker.

719
00:53:34,178 --> 00:53:37,146
Rusty, we have to go.

720
00:53:40,951 --> 00:53:43,285
That son of a bitch!

721
00:53:52,529 --> 00:53:54,163
Good bye, Hillary.

722
00:53:55,365 --> 00:53:56,832
I'll never forget.

723
00:53:56,834 --> 00:53:59,268
Preppy girls do it best.

724
00:54:11,681 --> 00:54:13,182
Rusty!

725
00:54:13,184 --> 00:54:14,917
We gotta go!
Come on!

726
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:19,888
Come on! Let's go!

727
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:00,763
What happened?

728
00:55:06,836 --> 00:55:08,237
Hillary's dead.

729
00:55:35,465 --> 00:55:38,000
You know earlier, when...

730
00:55:38,002 --> 00:55:40,102
she was saying that she
wanted to be out

731
00:55:40,104 --> 00:55:42,404
shopping for her prom dress?

732
00:55:44,207 --> 00:55:46,141
I thought "how typical..."

733
00:55:48,078 --> 00:55:51,980
"Princess wants to go
shopping for a prom dress."

734
00:55:51,982 --> 00:55:53,749
Why do we do that?

735
00:55:54,651 --> 00:55:56,251
Why do we have these...

736
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:00,222
misconceived ideas
of one another?

737
00:56:03,093 --> 00:56:04,360
If this wouldn't have happened,

738
00:56:04,362 --> 00:56:07,296
then we wouldn't
be talking like this.

739
00:56:10,133 --> 00:56:12,735
I don't want
to be like that anymore.

740
00:56:17,574 --> 00:56:19,308
Me neither.

741
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:22,845
So, how the hell
do we kill the psycho?

742
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:28,250
Any ideas?

743
00:56:31,187 --> 00:56:33,522
We have to find something
to arm ourselves with.

744
00:56:48,538 --> 00:56:50,072
I got this.

745
00:56:51,941 --> 00:56:53,108
Julie...

746
00:56:56,446 --> 00:56:57,980
What do you got, Shelly?

747
00:56:59,616 --> 00:57:00,849
Uh...

748
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:12,027
Let's go get this fucker.

749
00:57:12,029 --> 00:57:13,029
Let's go.

750
00:57:40,458 --> 00:57:41,657
Who goes there?

751
00:57:45,195 --> 00:57:46,428
Rusty?

752
00:57:49,399 --> 00:57:50,532
Julie?

753
00:57:56,439 --> 00:57:57,873
I said...

754
00:57:57,875 --> 00:57:59,508
who goes there?!

755
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:01,977
Shh!

756
00:58:01,979 --> 00:58:03,679
Why didn't you answer me?!

757
00:58:03,681 --> 00:58:05,347
Shut the fuck up.

758
00:58:05,349 --> 00:58:07,950
We're supposed to keep our
location secret, ass munch.

759
00:58:07,952 --> 00:58:09,818
Let go of my shirt.

760
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:12,521
Well then stop being
such a chicken shit!

761
00:58:12,523 --> 00:58:13,956
Deadweight.

762
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:16,925
I'm not a chickenshit.

763
00:58:16,927 --> 00:58:19,094
Not even scared.

764
00:58:19,629 --> 00:58:21,063
Come on guys.

765
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:24,933
We have to stick together
or we're dead.

766
00:58:26,803 --> 00:58:28,070
Okay?

767
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:31,273
Are we good?

768
00:58:31,275 --> 00:58:33,509
He needs to apologize
for his last remark.

769
00:58:35,112 --> 00:58:36,478
All right, shit.

770
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,180
You're not a deadweight.

771
00:58:38,182 --> 00:58:39,515
Hmm.

772
00:58:39,517 --> 00:58:42,751
And apologize for my shirt.

773
00:58:46,789 --> 00:58:49,424
All right. I'm sorry
i messed up your shirt.

774
00:58:49,426 --> 00:58:51,460
I'm sure your grandpa
would be mondo-pouty

775
00:58:51,462 --> 00:58:53,095
I wrinkled his shirt.

776
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:06,575
Hey. Hey, Julie!

777
00:59:06,577 --> 00:59:08,110
Hey, Julie, where you going?!

778
00:59:08,112 --> 00:59:10,712
Julie, come back!
I'm sorry!

779
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:13,482
Rusty and I,
we're-we're fine now.

780
00:59:13,484 --> 00:59:16,151
Look! We took
a major chill pill, all right?

781
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:22,858
This is how this is gonna go.

782
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:24,960
You, stop with your whining
and get on with your traps.

783
00:59:24,962 --> 00:59:27,229
And you, stop with
your third grade crap

784
00:59:27,231 --> 00:59:28,897
and get onto that hallway
and guard it.

785
00:59:28,899 --> 00:59:30,999
I'm gonna take the other end.

786
00:59:31,001 --> 00:59:32,935
If we don't stick together
we're gonna be...

787
00:59:32,937 --> 00:59:35,971
frickin' road pizza
by the end of the night.

788
00:59:43,613 --> 00:59:44,713
Shelly, you have fifteen minutes

789
00:59:44,715 --> 00:59:46,715
to come up
with something spectacular.

790
00:59:47,717 --> 00:59:49,284
Amaze me.

791
01:00:11,007 --> 01:00:12,975
All right it's all clear.

792
01:00:12,977 --> 01:00:15,410
Oh shit! What is that?

793
01:00:16,579 --> 01:00:19,114
It's a compound I made using
general household products,

794
01:00:19,116 --> 01:00:20,482
we should set it up
in every hallway

795
01:00:20,484 --> 01:00:22,417
and if he tries to get us
we can throw it on him.

796
01:00:22,419 --> 01:00:24,086
It'll neutralize him.

797
01:00:24,088 --> 01:00:25,554
All right cool, but we're gonna
need more buckets

798
01:00:25,556 --> 01:00:27,089
to put at the end
of each hallway.

799
01:00:27,091 --> 01:00:28,890
Hand me that rat poison.

800
01:00:31,761 --> 01:00:33,328
Go get those buckets.

801
01:00:38,334 --> 01:00:39,635
Hey, Shelly.

802
01:01:54,077 --> 01:01:55,410
Henderson...

803
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:03,151
You're gonna be all right.

804
01:02:07,623 --> 01:02:08,990
It'll be okay.

805
01:02:12,695 --> 01:02:14,896
I just need to... take a look.

806
01:02:32,115 --> 01:02:33,482
What?

807
01:03:06,249 --> 01:03:08,583
Let's hunt this bastard down!

808
01:03:10,753 --> 01:03:13,288
Our best bet is to drive him
into one of the traps.

809
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:15,957
What? We'll have to split up
to do that.

810
01:03:15,959 --> 01:03:17,425
She's right.

811
01:03:17,427 --> 01:03:20,495
We're gonna have to come at
this asshole from all sides.

812
01:03:20,497 --> 01:03:22,364
It's do or die time, shel.

813
01:03:32,842 --> 01:03:35,076
Let's crush this fly!

814
01:03:35,078 --> 01:03:37,345
For Mike, for Hillary.

815
01:03:56,332 --> 01:03:57,332
Roker!

816
01:04:19,322 --> 01:04:21,590
Here, let me help you with that.

817
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:36,204
Shh.

818
01:04:56,659 --> 01:04:58,226
Better run, Poindexter!

819
01:04:58,228 --> 01:05:00,595
I'll have your goddamn heart
on a platter!

820
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:06,468
Run!

821
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:16,478
<i>Test.</i>

822
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:18,647
<i>Aah! That's better!</i>

823
01:05:24,588 --> 01:05:26,288
I'm looking at you, little lady!

824
01:05:27,323 --> 01:05:29,024
<i>Uh, this one goes out</i>

825
01:05:29,026 --> 01:05:33,595
<i>to all you spoiled little
pieces of shit out there.</i>

826
01:05:33,597 --> 01:05:36,231
<i>New wave, baby!</i>

827
01:05:41,737 --> 01:05:43,672
Don't be such a spaz!

828
01:05:58,255 --> 01:05:59,587
Whatever.

829
01:06:17,273 --> 01:06:20,342
Please... no.

830
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:23,745
I'll do anything.

831
01:06:25,314 --> 01:06:27,282
You're not giving up now,
are you?

832
01:06:27,284 --> 01:06:28,583
Bud?!

833
01:06:29,618 --> 01:06:32,354
We didn't do anything!

834
01:06:32,356 --> 01:06:34,289
Come on, soldier!

835
01:06:35,458 --> 01:06:37,359
There's no use
crying about it now.

836
01:06:45,635 --> 01:06:47,736
Hey, slant-eye!

837
01:06:47,738 --> 01:06:49,337
On second thought...

838
01:06:51,774 --> 01:06:53,208
Let's jam.

839
01:06:57,514 --> 01:06:59,881
Oh, you little... bitch.

840
01:07:03,319 --> 01:07:04,919
Score!

841
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:13,261
You really got your head
in the game.

842
01:07:14,764 --> 01:07:16,197
Nighty night.

843
01:07:52,101 --> 01:07:55,470
You bitch!
What did you throw on me?!

844
01:07:55,472 --> 01:07:57,405
Oh, god!

845
01:08:00,477 --> 01:08:01,609
Die!

846
01:08:13,623 --> 01:08:14,989
It's over?

847
01:08:19,028 --> 01:08:20,528
It's over.

848
01:08:21,564 --> 01:08:22,964
That's all it took?

849
01:08:24,567 --> 01:08:26,768
That's all it took?!

850
01:08:26,770 --> 01:08:31,306
That's all it took?
That's all it took, asshole?

851
01:08:31,308 --> 01:08:33,475
That's all it took?
That's all it took?!

852
01:08:34,811 --> 01:08:35,910
Oh, shit!

853
01:08:35,912 --> 01:08:37,345
I'm outta here, asshole!

854
01:08:38,547 --> 01:08:40,448
You need to watch
your language, young lady.

855
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:45,854
Hey!

856
01:08:48,190 --> 01:08:50,925
You're gonna end up with
another detention next week!

857
01:09:39,109 --> 01:09:40,808
<i>Attention, student.</i>

858
01:09:40,810 --> 01:09:42,744
<i>I'm coming for you.</i>

859
01:09:43,345 --> 01:09:45,313
<i>I can hear you, Julie.</i>

860
01:09:47,483 --> 01:09:50,151
You crazy son of a bitch!

861
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:52,620
What is wrong with you?!

862
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:55,423
All we wanted to do
was get out of here,

863
01:09:55,425 --> 01:09:57,492
but you wouldn't let us!

864
01:09:58,394 --> 01:10:01,963
And now I'm stuck here.
Nowhere to run.

865
01:10:05,768 --> 01:10:08,002
<i>Time to die, Julie.</i>

866
01:10:08,004 --> 01:10:09,637
<i>That is all.</i>

867
01:10:20,115 --> 01:10:21,783
You know earlier, when...

868
01:10:22,685 --> 01:10:24,719
she was saying she wanted
to be out

869
01:10:24,721 --> 01:10:26,854
shopping for her prom dress?

870
01:10:28,090 --> 01:10:30,024
<i>"I thought," how typical...</i>

871
01:10:30,026 --> 01:10:32,760
<i>Princess wants to go
shopping for a prom dress.</i>

872
01:10:32,762 --> 01:10:34,162
<i>Why do we do that?</i>

873
01:10:34,164 --> 01:10:36,397
<i>Why do we have these...</i>

874
01:10:36,399 --> 01:10:39,934
<i>misconceived ideas
of one another?</i>

875
01:10:39,936 --> 01:10:41,236
<i>If this wouldn't have happened,</i>

876
01:10:41,238 --> 01:10:44,305
<i>then we wouldn't be
talking like this.</i>

877
01:10:44,307 --> 01:10:46,474
I don't wanna
be like that anymore.

878
01:10:47,743 --> 01:10:49,510
I'm not gonna do this anymore.

879
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,034
Julie!

880
01:11:47,369 --> 01:11:48,703
I smell you.

881
01:11:52,675 --> 01:11:54,342
I smell you!

882
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:58,112
Where are you, you bitch?

883
01:11:58,114 --> 01:11:59,414
Huh?

884
01:12:00,482 --> 01:12:02,583
You're in my jungle now.

885
01:12:03,786 --> 01:12:04,952
Understand?

886
01:12:06,455 --> 01:12:08,990
I'm gonna fuckin' devour you.

887
01:12:08,992 --> 01:12:11,059
You dink bitch!

888
01:12:12,094 --> 01:12:14,028
What you did to me...

889
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:19,233
That was mind control!

890
01:12:20,502 --> 01:12:22,136
Julie!

891
01:12:23,506 --> 01:12:24,706
Hear that?!

892
01:12:25,942 --> 01:12:27,775
It is the sound of nothing.

893
01:12:27,777 --> 01:12:30,511
No chopper's coming for you!

894
01:12:30,513 --> 01:12:31,946
You're in my jungle.

895
01:12:32,548 --> 01:12:33,548
My jungle!

896
01:12:34,917 --> 01:12:38,286
You don't get to
outta here, bitch.

897
01:12:38,288 --> 01:12:39,787
Oh!

898
01:12:39,789 --> 01:12:43,224
Oh, my boyfriend Mike is dead!

899
01:12:47,263 --> 01:12:50,565
He cut him in half!

900
01:12:51,834 --> 01:12:55,036
That's nothing compared
to what I'll do to you!

901
01:12:57,674 --> 01:12:59,474
I'm gonna end you.

902
01:13:00,275 --> 01:13:03,077
After what you did to me
and my men!

903
01:13:04,213 --> 01:13:06,347
They were my men!

904
01:13:06,349 --> 01:13:07,915
Good men!

905
01:13:09,051 --> 01:13:12,954
I'm gonna wear your ears
for a necklace.

906
01:13:14,656 --> 01:13:18,893
I've got some 556
for your fucking teeth...

907
01:13:18,895 --> 01:13:21,929
and then I'll devour them
and shit 'em out...

908
01:13:21,931 --> 01:13:24,499
on your cold fucking corpse!

909
01:13:24,501 --> 01:13:26,567
You understand me?!

910
01:13:26,569 --> 01:13:28,236
You dink!

911
01:13:29,204 --> 01:13:31,272
I'm gonna take my blade...

912
01:13:31,274 --> 01:13:34,542
and I'm gonna bury it
deep into you, you bitch...

913
01:13:34,544 --> 01:13:36,944
like I did
to your boyfriend, Mike!

914
01:13:41,450 --> 01:13:44,952
Thieves, the dinks...

915
01:13:44,954 --> 01:13:46,687
I'm comin' for you!

916
01:14:25,427 --> 01:14:26,661
Shit.

917
01:14:34,036 --> 01:14:35,503
Oh, my god.

918
01:14:37,674 --> 01:14:38,739
Where?!

919
01:14:39,708 --> 01:14:40,875
I can't see.

920
01:14:45,647 --> 01:14:47,648
Where are you?!

921
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:50,485
There you are, slant-eye!

922
01:14:50,487 --> 01:14:51,953
As if!

923
01:14:53,789 --> 01:14:56,691
Well, since we are up here...

924
01:14:57,659 --> 01:15:00,328
let's have a little lesson
in gravity.

925
01:15:02,398 --> 01:15:04,899
Why are you doing this?!

926
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:17,612
Get back here!

927
01:15:24,186 --> 01:15:27,154
For all my men
lost to the likes of you!

928
01:15:27,156 --> 01:15:28,890
We're just kids!

929
01:15:28,892 --> 01:15:30,091
Scum!

930
01:15:30,093 --> 01:15:32,460
It's 1983!

931
01:15:33,328 --> 01:15:34,562
They're all gone now.

932
01:15:34,564 --> 01:15:37,365
I'm just a kid!
Please! Please!

933
01:15:37,367 --> 01:15:40,334
Ong thanh, loc ninh...

934
01:15:42,604 --> 01:15:44,472

935
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:46,941
mekong delta,

936
01:15:46,943 --> 01:15:49,844

937
01:15:49,846 --> 01:15:51,679

938
01:15:54,283 --> 01:15:55,850
They're all gone now.

939
01:15:58,955 --> 01:16:00,621
Ghosts!

940
01:16:01,423 --> 01:16:02,790
Please...

941
01:16:05,994 --> 01:16:07,428
Please!

942
01:16:07,930 --> 01:16:09,964
No, no, no!

943
01:16:10,699 --> 01:16:13,634
I live surrounded by ghosts!

944
01:16:14,837 --> 01:16:17,104
No! No!

945
01:16:26,949 --> 01:16:28,215
Help!

946
01:16:28,217 --> 01:16:29,483
Help me!

947
01:16:29,985 --> 01:16:31,886
Little girl?

948
01:16:31,888 --> 01:16:33,521
Please.

949
01:16:35,023 --> 01:16:36,390
No.

950
01:16:37,726 --> 01:16:39,760
I'm an American hero.

951
01:16:39,762 --> 01:16:43,297
Why did you do it?
Why?!

952
01:16:43,299 --> 01:16:44,865
You tried to kill me.

953
01:16:45,934 --> 01:16:47,301
You are the enemies!

954
01:16:47,303 --> 01:16:49,870
We were just stupid kids!

955
01:16:49,872 --> 01:16:53,841
But you are right
about one thing, mr roker.

956
01:16:53,843 --> 01:16:56,811
We are enemies now!

957
01:16:56,813 --> 01:17:00,114
And gravity...
Is so righteous.

958
01:17:00,116 --> 01:17:01,349
No!

959
01:17:29,979 --> 01:17:32,713
Sometimes I can't help
but imagine...

960
01:17:33,882 --> 01:17:36,851
what their lives
might have been.

961
01:17:36,853 --> 01:17:38,352
<i>Hillary...</i>

962
01:17:40,455 --> 01:17:42,256
she would be a news anchor...

963
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:45,459
<i>or a rich socialite...</i>

964
01:17:46,128 --> 01:17:48,262
helping the disadvantaged.

965
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:53,200
Rusty?

966
01:17:57,606 --> 01:18:00,975
He'd probably be running around
with the other hooligans...

967
01:18:02,544 --> 01:18:04,412
but then again...

968
01:18:07,149 --> 01:18:09,083
this might have changed him.

969
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:14,288
I could see him
turning a new leaf.

970
01:18:16,491 --> 01:18:19,126
Maybe becoming a cop.

971
01:18:21,396 --> 01:18:23,097
That would be ironic.

972
01:18:28,870 --> 01:18:30,337
Shelly?

973
01:18:34,843 --> 01:18:37,845
Who knows
what amazing discoveries...

974
01:18:37,847 --> 01:18:39,513
she would have made.

975
01:18:42,884 --> 01:18:45,286
How the world will suffer
without her.

976
01:19:01,903 --> 01:19:03,471
Mike.

977
01:19:09,177 --> 01:19:11,712
He'd be winning
the big football game...

978
01:19:13,515 --> 01:19:16,117
and I'd be at the sideline
cheering him on.

979
01:19:17,986 --> 01:19:19,553
<i>We all would.</i>

980
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:25,960
Sometimes when it's quiet...

981
01:19:27,929 --> 01:19:29,630
and I'm all alone...

982
01:19:33,268 --> 01:19:35,035
i pretend that...

983
01:19:37,572 --> 01:19:40,808
we're married and that
we have two children.

984
01:19:43,745 --> 01:19:45,346
Living...

985
01:19:48,416 --> 01:19:50,818
<i>in a safe suburb somewhere.</i>

986
01:19:53,688 --> 01:19:55,656
<i>But that's all gone now.</i>

987
01:20:45,607 --> 01:20:48,342
Look. That's the girl that lived
through the murder spree.

988
01:20:48,344 --> 01:20:51,145
Wow. I can't believe
she came to prom.

989
01:20:51,147 --> 01:20:52,880
Hey, back off, slick.

990
01:20:53,916 --> 01:20:55,249
Bogus.
