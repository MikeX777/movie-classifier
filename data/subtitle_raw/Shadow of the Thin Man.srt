1
00:01:53,938 --> 00:01:57,203
Well, now who's holding up the caravan?

2
00:02:03,898 --> 00:02:06,059
Now who's holding up the caravan?

3
00:02:06,234 --> 00:02:08,964
Asta, fall in.

4
00:02:09,738 --> 00:02:12,070
My gosh, we'll never get
this roadwork done.

5
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,607
Hey, Nick, how about
taking the chain off?

6
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:19,000
Yes. Have you disappear
like you did yesterday?

7
00:02:19,414 --> 00:02:22,440
What's your mother going to think?
Look, I tell you what.

8
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:26,443
Let's sit down, huh? You're tired.

9
00:02:26,863 --> 00:02:29,798
I'm not tired. You're tired.

10
00:02:30,533 --> 00:02:35,527
Look, if you'll fall off the roadwork,
I'll read you a new fairy tale.

11
00:02:35,705 --> 00:02:38,970
- Oh, no. I've heard all those, Nick.
- No, no. This is a brand-new one.

12
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,990
This is one you've never heard before.

13
00:02:41,152 --> 00:02:43,052
Okay, Asta?

14
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:45,525
Okay, Nick. You're on.

15
00:02:45,715 --> 00:02:48,377
All right, now, you fellas hop right up
here on the bench.

16
00:02:48,551 --> 00:02:50,610
- Here, you be leash holder.
- All right.

17
00:02:50,779 --> 00:02:53,805
Now, hold on to your bench...

18
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:56,771
...because this one's gonna be a wow.

19
00:02:58,336 --> 00:02:59,769
Now...

20
00:03:03,008 --> 00:03:05,943
Once upon a time, there was a horse.

21
00:03:07,512 --> 00:03:11,915
There were hundreds of horses. White ones,
black ones, brown ones, beautiful horses.

22
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:14,201
And how they could run.

23
00:03:15,136 --> 00:03:18,537
Mrs. Charles. Mrs. Charles!

24
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:19,918
Yes, Stella?

25
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:23,643
- Baby's lunch is waiting, ma'am.
- Oh, of course.

26
00:03:26,147 --> 00:03:28,877
They should have been back
10 minutes ago.

27
00:03:29,034 --> 00:03:31,559
But you know how men are.
They like to stay out late...

28
00:03:31,761 --> 00:03:34,491
...to show their independence.
- They sure do.

29
00:03:34,656 --> 00:03:36,647
I'll see if they're still in the park.

30
00:03:42,772 --> 00:03:45,400
I see them.
They're sitting on a bench.

31
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:49,111
- You mean, Mr. Charles is sitting down?
- So is Nicky.

32
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:52,406
You mean, they ain't walking at all?

33
00:03:53,341 --> 00:03:58,176
The boss must've done some tall conniving
before that baby let him squat.

34
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:02,565
They're such great pals. He's getting
more like his father every day.

35
00:04:02,734 --> 00:04:07,103
He sure is. This morning he
was playing with a corkscrew.

36
00:04:08,406 --> 00:04:11,432
The darling. He's reading
the baby fairy tales.

37
00:04:11,801 --> 00:04:15,931
"Foxy Gent, who stops in the stretch..."

38
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:22,085
- hasn't a chance to win,
but he's liable to come in first...

39
00:04:22,253 --> 00:04:24,813
...in case he forgets to quit.

40
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:28,643
Nick, why don't you just put down
the book and read the racing form.

41
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:38,552
Nicholas, you know, you're getting
more like your mother every day.

42
00:04:39,053 --> 00:04:43,990
All right. Son of a Gun is 40-1.

43
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:55,289
Nicky, something tells me that something
important is happening somewhere.

44
00:04:55,453 --> 00:04:57,546
And I think we should be there.

45
00:05:00,517 --> 00:05:02,985
He's up on his feet!

46
00:05:03,294 --> 00:05:05,660
He's heading this way!

47
00:05:11,136 --> 00:05:14,663
Ma'am, did he hear that,
or did he smell it?

48
00:05:14,864 --> 00:05:16,957
- That's Mr. Charles, isn't it?
- Yes'm.

49
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:19,483
- This is a cocktail, isn't it?
- Yes'm.

50
00:05:19,644 --> 00:05:21,407
They'll get together.

51
00:05:21,596 --> 00:05:23,188
Yes'm.

52
00:05:23,373 --> 00:05:28,333
Must be tele... Telescope...

53
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,854
In the old days, they put a lamp
in the window.

54
00:05:47,005 --> 00:05:51,101
Stella, the lost patrol has returned,
finally.

55
00:05:51,292 --> 00:05:54,784
Well, Mommy, we had to get Jack
down off the beanstalk.

56
00:05:54,963 --> 00:05:57,056
- Hi there.
- Mommy!

57
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,730
Hello, darling.

58
00:05:58,908 --> 00:06:00,637
- Did you have a good time?
- Yes.

59
00:06:00,802 --> 00:06:02,793
- Did Daddy read you a story?
- Yes.

60
00:06:02,971 --> 00:06:04,370
Tell Mommy the story.

61
00:06:04,522 --> 00:06:07,685
Son of a Gun is 40-1.

62
00:06:11,646 --> 00:06:15,412
Don't you think we should have a rug
over there to cover that bare spot?

63
00:06:15,592 --> 00:06:17,492
Someday, when you're president...

64
00:06:17,652 --> 00:06:20,246
...you're going to be able to say,
"My daddy was a tout."

65
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:24,890
You'd better hurry up with your lunch.
Your baked potato's waiting.

66
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,646
Come on, Long Shot.

67
00:06:30,331 --> 00:06:33,266
Swing it, sugar. I've got a sleeper
in the first...

68
00:06:33,443 --> 00:06:35,468
...and I don't wanna miss it.
It's a honey.

69
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:38,170
I'll be with you in two shakes
of a cocktail.

70
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:40,330
Cocktail? Cocktail.

71
00:06:40,508 --> 00:06:45,502
I think I'll try one of those things.
Estrellita!

72
00:06:47,565 --> 00:06:49,032
Estrelli...

73
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:51,507
Yes, sir. Here it is.

74
00:06:51,686 --> 00:06:53,916
What do you know?
Must be telepathy.

75
00:06:54,072 --> 00:06:57,405
Doggone! That's the word
I was looking for.

76
00:06:58,743 --> 00:07:03,578
A gorgeous gal, a cocktail, seven winners
this afternoon. Am I in a rut.

77
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:08,431
Seven winners. Let's see if you can
pick one winner for me right now.

78
00:07:08,586 --> 00:07:10,747
What, a dress?

79
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:14,764
Sugar, winners are what I pick
nothing else than.

80
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:18,961
Of course, there you are, right there.
That's my favorite.

81
00:07:19,155 --> 00:07:21,123
Oh, Nicky, that's a nightgown.

82
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:24,543
- It's still my favorite.
- Mr. Charles!

83
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:28,621
Here it is. That telescope
is working regular now.

84
00:07:28,773 --> 00:07:31,401
And not a moment too soon.

85
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:38,019
<i>Oh, give me the road</i>
<i>The wide country highway</i>

86
00:07:32,777 --> 00:07:36,770
<i>Oh, give me a gal who's going my way</i>

87
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:42,110
<i>Oh, give me the road, the wide open spaces</i>

88
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:47,509
<i>And give me a wife who's going... places</i>

89
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:49,561
That's very touching, dear,
but I wish you wouldn't drive so fast.

90
00:07:51,746 --> 00:07:56,513
<i>I don't tell you how to run the house</i>

91
00:07:55,058 --> 00:08:00,462
<i>Oh, give me a hole</i>
<i>I'm just a mouse</i>

92
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,655
Well, what's new?

93
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,535
Thank goodness neither of us was driving.
We don't know a thing about it.

94
00:08:14,152 --> 00:08:15,813
I know, I know.

95
00:08:18,273 --> 00:08:22,767
You were just hurrying downtown
to cash a relief check.

96
00:08:20,108 --> 00:08:21,871
Officer, that's a very funny line.

97
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:30,625
You mean, it was, five years ago.
Your license, please.

98
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:31,307
I realize that you're the guardian
of our safety...

99
00:08:33,505 --> 00:08:35,996
...but this was
an extenuating circumstance.

100
00:08:36,007 --> 00:08:39,170
Now, now, just open up your license.

101
00:08:38,677 --> 00:08:43,512
Come on, open it up. Wider. Wider.

102
00:08:42,013 --> 00:08:44,709
Now, don't worry.
This isn't going to hurt a bit.

103
00:08:47,018 --> 00:08:49,350
Dear, if you went to the dentist
when you should...

104
00:08:50,021 --> 00:08:52,615
...he wouldn't have to follow you
around on a motorcycle.

105
00:08:52,524 --> 00:08:54,788
March 23rd.

106
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:56,538
Nick...

107
00:08:58,171 --> 00:08:59,968
Charles.

108
00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:02,217
Nick...? Nick Charles, the detective?

109
00:09:01,533 --> 00:09:04,832
Say, Mr. Charles,
this sure is a pleasure!

110
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:08,337
I should have recognized you,
seen your pictures in the papers.

111
00:09:07,822 --> 00:09:10,154
I follow all your cases.

112
00:09:11,993 --> 00:09:14,757
We still talk about the Thin Man job
and the Landis case.

113
00:09:14,496 --> 00:09:16,657
- Yeah?
- Why, it's the slickest detective work...

114
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,877
...in 50 years. Nick Charles. The last time
I read about you, Mr. Charles...

115
00:09:19,776 --> 00:09:22,574
...you was in New York, you was.
- I were? I was?

116
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:26,730
Yes, you was. Say, Nick,
you working on a new case?

117
00:09:27,342 --> 00:09:29,640
- Well...
- You can tell me, Nick.

118
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:32,064
What kind of a job you on this time?

119
00:09:32,347 --> 00:09:34,042
I'm trying to fix a speeding ticket.

120
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:38,769
Well, you could do it if anyone could.
What's the address?

121
00:09:36,568 --> 00:09:38,433
We're staying at the St. Cloud Hotel.

122
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:45,324
St. Cloud Hotel. Say, isn't this
a great day to get out of the city?

123
00:09:42,857 --> 00:09:44,518
- Yeah.
- Especially in an open car.

124
00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:51,021
When you go 80 miles an hour
in this job, I bet you don't even feel it.

125
00:09:49,364 --> 00:09:51,958
He's feeling it now, aren't you, Nicky?

126
00:09:53,034 --> 00:09:57,801
Boy, oh, boy. Wait till I tell the family
I met Nick Charles and Mrs. Charles.

127
00:09:55,979 --> 00:09:57,446
This is Mrs. Charles, ain't it?

128
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:03,495
Well, that's the way we check in
at the motels.

129
00:10:02,928 --> 00:10:05,761
No one will get a word out of me, Nick.
It's okay, honey.

130
00:10:05,714 --> 00:10:07,705
Just sign it, Nick.

131
00:10:09,434 --> 00:10:12,426
I made a carbon copy for the kids.
They save autographs.

132
00:10:11,886 --> 00:10:13,285
I'm flattered.

133
00:10:15,056 --> 00:10:16,648
Where you heading, Nick? The track?

134
00:10:16,608 --> 00:10:18,667
Yes. But we'd just as soon sit here
and talk.

135
00:10:18,393 --> 00:10:19,621
No, that'd make you late.

136
00:10:20,612 --> 00:10:24,048
To show you how the force feels
about you, I'll escort you to the track.

137
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,472
Oh, boy, wait till the gang hears
about this.

138
00:10:25,617 --> 00:10:29,053
Follow me, Nick. I'll get you there!

139
00:10:31,957 --> 00:10:33,720
Now what?

140
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:07,584
Scads of police cars and motorcycles.

141
00:11:10,829 --> 00:11:12,990
And I see an ambulance too.

142
00:11:17,168 --> 00:11:19,830
Keep an eye on that.
It may come in handy.

143
00:11:19,504 --> 00:11:21,404
Well, not bad. Get second money.

144
00:11:41,309 --> 00:11:44,437
You almost got insurance money.
What's happening? Looks like a riot.

145
00:11:43,361 --> 00:11:45,727
Maybe somebody hit the daily double.

146
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:48,334
Hi, Nick. How are you, pal?

147
00:11:49,201 --> 00:11:51,362
What do you know?
If it ain't Nick Charles.

148
00:11:51,036 --> 00:11:53,834
Hiya, Nick, it's good to see you!

149
00:11:53,371 --> 00:11:55,430
How've you been, Nick?

150
00:11:57,042 --> 00:12:00,603
Nick, how'd you get here so soon?
We only got the flash a couple minutes ago.

151
00:11:59,494 --> 00:12:02,224
- We were swept into it.
- Don't let us keep you, boys.

152
00:12:03,214 --> 00:12:07,241
- There's no hurry, Nick. We were...
- So there's no hurry, there isn't, huh?

153
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,905
- Lieutenant Abrams.
- Hello, lieutenant.

154
00:12:10,338 --> 00:12:12,704
You flannel-headed playboys!
There's been a murder.

155
00:12:12,282 --> 00:12:14,876
You're on the scene of the crime,
and you're here jawing.

156
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:20,085
Get to work before I hand out a flock
of suspensions! Come on, shake it!

157
00:12:17,562 --> 00:12:20,554
Hello, Nick. Hello, Mrs. Charles.
What's the good word?

158
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,853
Did I hear something said
a minute ago about speed?

159
00:12:28,189 --> 00:12:30,419
- That's discipline.
- You said a man was murdered.

160
00:12:31,192 --> 00:12:34,787
Don't worry. He won't get away. You know,
I haven't seen you and Nick in ages.

161
00:12:33,578 --> 00:12:35,978
- What happened?
- You know that jockey, Goldez?

162
00:12:37,365 --> 00:12:39,629
The one caught throwing
the fourth race yesterday?

163
00:12:39,918 --> 00:12:43,251
- He was shot.
- My, they're strict at this track.

164
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,133
What?

165
00:12:45,874 --> 00:12:49,002
I don't think the track officials shot
this one, do you, lieutenant?

166
00:12:47,817 --> 00:12:50,650
He was undoubtedly bumped off
to keep him from talking.

167
00:12:51,096 --> 00:12:52,529
Sounds exciting. Who did it?

168
00:12:54,099 --> 00:12:57,830
Person or persons unknown did the job,
and it's my job...

169
00:12:55,717 --> 00:12:57,548
...to see that they don't stay unknown.

170
00:12:59,604 --> 00:13:01,572
Well, so long, Nick.
Goodbye, Mrs. Charles.

171
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:05,141
- I gotta see a man about a murder.
- Good luck, lieutenant.

172
00:13:01,606 --> 00:13:05,474
With luck, we'll be out of here by
the last race. There go my seven winners.

173
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,150
The body's back in the shower,
lieutenant. This way.

174
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:11,720
All right, one side. Heads up.

175
00:13:13,234 --> 00:13:16,635
All right, boys. Heads up.
Coroner, here's Lieutenant Abrams.

176
00:13:15,787 --> 00:13:19,484
Nice of you to come over, lieutenant.
The DA thought you'd better be in on this.

177
00:13:22,686 --> 00:13:26,019
- Probably be laid in your lap anyway.
- Okay, okay. What's the score?

178
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:29,139
Death was instantaneous
from a bullet wound...

179
00:13:30,635 --> 00:13:32,762
...penetrating the left eye
and then the brain.

180
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:37,700
A.38-caliber bullet, or maybe
a little bigger. I'll get it for you later.

181
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,669
Would the angle of fire be okay
if it was fired from that window?

182
00:13:38,977 --> 00:13:42,105
Mind your own business, Clarke.
I'm running the Homicide Squad.

183
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,172
Not you and your paper.

184
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:49,072
A couple guys get out there and beat
through the grounds for the gun.

185
00:13:49,154 --> 00:13:50,849
Come on! Okay, you guys.

186
00:13:50,772 --> 00:13:53,002
You took enough pictures
to paper a house.

187
00:13:54,134 --> 00:13:57,103
- Well, Nick Charles! What's cooking, kid?
- Give us the lowdown.

188
00:13:55,994 --> 00:14:00,397
- I've got nothing to do with this case.
- Oh, come on, Nick.

189
00:13:59,814 --> 00:14:02,578
- I'm looking for Lieutenant Abrams.
- Come on, Nick.

190
00:14:02,951 --> 00:14:07,183
You're only wasting your film.
I'm just a bystander. Hello, Paul.

191
00:14:07,506 --> 00:14:10,942
Will you call these newshawks off?
I've got nothing to do with this.

192
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,221
I'm looking for Abrams.
He been around?

193
00:14:14,846 --> 00:14:16,905
I thought I told you guys to beat it.

194
00:14:18,466 --> 00:14:20,798
Mr. Charles has got no connection
with this case.

195
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:24,403
What did I tell you? Lieutenant,
have you any influence with the police?

196
00:14:22,637 --> 00:14:25,504
- Sure, I got great connections.
- Maybe you can help me out.

197
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,904
My car is completely surrounded
by your mechanized division.

198
00:14:29,311 --> 00:14:32,678
Sure. Say, get some of those squad cars
out of Mr. Charles' way.

199
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:33,567
- Right.
- Thanks, lieutenant.

200
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:38,125
Nick! Nick, I wanna ask you something.

201
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:42,381
- But...
- Just a minute, Nick, I'll be right back.

202
00:14:40,205 --> 00:14:43,140
I room with Goldez, and last night
he didn't sleep a wink.

203
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:46,700
He was scared. He knew they
were laying for him. Poor Goldez.

204
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,734
He never kept a horse from winning
till they made him do it.

205
00:14:50,048 --> 00:14:52,778
Is it all right with you
if I question these witnesses?

206
00:14:53,718 --> 00:14:56,812
Get back in there, kid.
Get him out, and keep him out!

207
00:14:56,671 --> 00:14:58,263
The gamblers, they murdered Goldez.

208
00:14:59,558 --> 00:15:03,494
They were afraid he'd squeal at the inquiry.
They laid for him, and they got him.

209
00:15:02,844 --> 00:15:04,744
Get it, quick!
Let him get the picture.

210
00:15:04,621 --> 00:15:06,452
- Okay.
- Dry up!

211
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:09,936
All right, let's go.

212
00:15:10,794 --> 00:15:13,228
Clarke, how about splitting
with us on this picture?

213
00:15:12,796 --> 00:15:15,321
- Sorry, Barrow, that's exclusive.
- Don't be like that.

214
00:15:14,189 --> 00:15:16,623
Let me take it.
I'll have prints made for all of us.

215
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,634
I wouldn't trust you with that plate, Whitey.
Something might just happen to it.

216
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:22,266
Why, you punk newshog.
Another crack like that, and I'll...

217
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,707
Fight outside, you scribblers!

218
00:15:26,084 --> 00:15:28,678
Go on, get outside and kill each other.
See if I care.

219
00:15:29,037 --> 00:15:31,267
Get them out of here!
Wait a minute, Mr. Charles.

220
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:33,543
- Look, they're almost at the post now.
- We're old friends.

221
00:15:33,592 --> 00:15:36,561
So I don't mind letting you in on the dope
before the papers.

222
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:38,010
Every time I miss a race,
I'm losing dough.

223
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,178
The murderer couldn't get in
from this side...

224
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:44,118
...and there are no footprints
on the outside.

225
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:48,494
There's no gun, no clue, no nothing.
Very interesting, huh?

226
00:15:46,663 --> 00:15:49,826
- Yes, very.
- Of course, I know just what to do.

227
00:15:48,915 --> 00:15:53,818
- Oh, of course you do.
- But, Nick, what would you do?

228
00:15:53,395 --> 00:15:55,386
- Well, if I were you...
- Yeah?

229
00:15:56,731 --> 00:15:59,291
...and I was in the spot you're in...
- Yeah, yeah?

230
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:04,334
...l'd take a shower.

231
00:16:04,239 --> 00:16:06,969
All right, there we are.

232
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,791
Did Daddy win at the races today?

233
00:16:12,747 --> 00:16:16,012
Darling, just keep quiet.

234
00:16:15,634 --> 00:16:20,799
- Doesn't Daddy ever win at the races?
- Darling, don't ask questions.

235
00:16:18,637 --> 00:16:20,798
Daddy go to the races tomorrow?

236
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:25,821
No, dear. Daddy go to court
on speeding rap.

237
00:16:28,313 --> 00:16:31,805
Reference to the father's police record
may tend to undermine...

238
00:16:30,649 --> 00:16:33,482
...the child's parental respect.

239
00:16:35,771 --> 00:16:38,262
Perhaps you're right, dear.

240
00:16:39,441 --> 00:16:41,272
Asta, are your hands clean?

241
00:16:42,444 --> 00:16:44,776
That's fine.

242
00:16:48,617 --> 00:16:49,879
Daddy, drink.

243
00:16:53,171 --> 00:16:55,105
Thanks, pal.

244
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,591
Mommy, he's a great kid.
I'm much obliged.

245
00:16:59,844 --> 00:17:01,243
It was nothing. Any time.

246
00:17:01,963 --> 00:17:03,453
Daddy, drink milk.

247
00:17:04,632 --> 00:17:08,693
- Daddy doesn't like milk.
- Stella, bring Mr. Charles a glass of milk.

248
00:17:10,138 --> 00:17:13,164
But, darling, we mustn't let him
become headstrong.

249
00:17:13,475 --> 00:17:15,409
Daddy, drink milk!

250
00:17:18,922 --> 00:17:21,891
He's made up his mind.
He won't drink it unless you do too.

251
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,116
But I can't drink milk.
I'm a big boy now.

252
00:17:25,261 --> 00:17:29,027
I wear long pants. I go out with girls.

253
00:17:28,373 --> 00:17:30,398
No. Drink milk.

254
00:17:30,542 --> 00:17:33,670
If you let him down now,
you'll kill all his respect.

255
00:17:34,495 --> 00:17:36,690
Stella, take the shaker away.

256
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:38,520
Well?

257
00:17:42,887 --> 00:17:44,821
It's awfully white, isn't it?

258
00:17:55,016 --> 00:17:57,416
You wanted to be a father.

259
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:00,538
Drunk, dear?

260
00:18:00,688 --> 00:18:04,351
I keep seeing purple cows.

261
00:18:31,828 --> 00:18:34,490
Mr. Charles, there's some gentlemens
to see you.

262
00:18:34,439 --> 00:18:37,704
A Mr. Paul Sculley and Mayor Clarke.

263
00:18:40,778 --> 00:18:45,806
Paul...? That could be Paul Clarke
and Major Sculley.

264
00:18:43,614 --> 00:18:46,082
I think perhaps I'd better see them.

265
00:18:47,068 --> 00:18:49,093
Can't they wait
until you've finished dinner?

266
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:57,794
This may be very important.
I hate to tear myself away.

267
00:18:54,909 --> 00:18:59,175
- Well, hello, Paul. Hiya, major.
- Hello, Nick.

268
00:18:57,103 --> 00:18:58,968
You don't know how happy
I am to see you.

269
00:19:05,261 --> 00:19:07,024
- You are?
- You got here just in time.

270
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:12,617
My son just put me on the milk wagon.

271
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:13,472
- Will you have a snort?
- Not a thing.

272
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:18,317
No? Well, sit down. I'll have just
a short antidote. What's up?

273
00:19:16,773 --> 00:19:19,105
Well, I suppose we might
as well get down to cases.

274
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:21,491
I hope you don't mean murder cases.

275
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:26,897
Nick, when they appointed me
special deputy for the State Legislature...

276
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:27,762
...they handed me a headache.

277
00:19:29,786 --> 00:19:32,118
This gambling racket
getting you down, major?

278
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,274
That jockey was our first real witness.

279
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:38,419
Goldez might have talked, Nick,
so they shut him up with a bullet.

280
00:19:37,793 --> 00:19:41,559
- And we're right back where we started.
- That's a luckier break than Goldez got.

281
00:19:39,904 --> 00:19:42,498
The syndicate responsible for this
has gotta be smashed.

282
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:46,276
But we're helpless unless we get
actual evidence to convict them.

283
00:19:47,136 --> 00:19:49,468
I can think of pleasanter pastimes
than tangling...

284
00:19:49,914 --> 00:19:52,849
...with the Stephens-Macy crowd.
- It's not who they are, Nick.

285
00:19:53,167 --> 00:19:56,261
- It's how to nail them.
- You're the one man who can do that.

286
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:57,570
He can do anything,
if he'll get to work.

287
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:01,224
Why, grandma,
what long ears you've got.

288
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:03,900
- Good evening, major.
- Mrs. Charles.

289
00:20:04,128 --> 00:20:06,255
Hello, Paul. How's my favorite reporter?

290
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:10,472
Not doing so well at the moment, Nora.
That's why I'm here.

291
00:20:08,741 --> 00:20:10,971
Shall I get your hat?

292
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:12,306
What, me go to work?

293
00:20:14,998 --> 00:20:19,162
Why, I'd feel like a cad, leaving you
to spend dull evenings alone.

294
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,882
Dull? I'd just love to see
you catch those crooks.

295
00:20:19,002 --> 00:20:22,904
- Good.
- Well, Nick, we're a united front.

296
00:20:23,339 --> 00:20:26,274
Well, thanks, major,
but I really haven't the time.

297
00:20:25,842 --> 00:20:28,242
Mrs. Charles has to be taken places.

298
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:34,128
Dances, prizefights, nightclubs,
wrestling bouts.

299
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:34,966
You never take me to wrestling bouts.

300
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:39,357
- Well, you're always asking me to.
- There's some tonight. Will you take me?

301
00:20:40,048 --> 00:20:41,606
Well...

302
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:46,837
- Too late to get tickets now, dear.
- Nick, you can have my press pass.

303
00:20:47,338 --> 00:20:49,602
Oh, thanks, Paul.

304
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,544
Saboteur. Well, you see?

305
00:20:54,704 --> 00:20:57,764
Yes, Nick, I think I do.
Well, it was a good idea while we had it.

306
00:20:58,374 --> 00:21:01,434
Nora, if you ever get tired of wrestling,
lend him to us, will you?

307
00:21:01,186 --> 00:21:02,983
What will I wear for the wrestling?

308
00:21:04,405 --> 00:21:06,305
The little girl
has never wrestled before.

309
00:21:07,659 --> 00:21:10,253
They're wearing tights this season, dear.

310
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:11,695
Yeah, tights. You know.

311
00:21:11,696 --> 00:21:13,459
Joe! Joe!

312
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:18,434
Oh, excuse me, lady.
Gee, that's a screwy-looking hat.

313
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:22,873
Hey, Joe!

314
00:21:23,233 --> 00:21:25,064
Two, please.

315
00:21:27,403 --> 00:21:28,961
Tickets for Paul Clarke.

316
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:34,358
Yes, sir.

317
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:40,459
Nick Charles, alias Paul Clarke, huh?

318
00:21:40,942 --> 00:21:45,470
Hello, Macy. Yes, Clarke's letting us
use his tickets tonight. All right with you?

319
00:21:42,527 --> 00:21:45,394
Sure. I didn't know you were
a friend of Clarke's.

320
00:21:45,338 --> 00:21:48,535
Oh, bosom pals. He's a smart reporter.

321
00:21:50,068 --> 00:21:52,559
Is he? I never read his stuff.

322
00:21:53,096 --> 00:21:57,396
You should. It's fellas like you that
help him write it. Thank you.

323
00:21:56,457 --> 00:21:59,551
- Nick Charles, glad to see you.
- Oh, Mr. Stephens.

324
00:21:59,127 --> 00:22:01,595
You're gonna see
some great wrestling tonight.

325
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:09,420
How do you know? You at the rehearsal?

326
00:22:10,613 --> 00:22:12,410
My mistake. Sorry, dear.

327
00:22:13,258 --> 00:22:15,658
That's one of the babies
Sculley wanted me to tackle.

328
00:22:19,289 --> 00:22:22,588
Which one? The man
or the fur-bearing animal?

329
00:22:21,266 --> 00:22:24,099
That's right.
Study the case from all angles.

330
00:22:23,818 --> 00:22:25,581
- Hello, Whitey.
- Hello, Link.

331
00:22:28,298 --> 00:22:30,823
- How do you do, Miss Porter?
- How do you do?

332
00:22:33,778 --> 00:22:36,406
Link, I wanna see you
about something important.

333
00:22:35,697 --> 00:22:37,688
Sure. Always glad to talk to the press.

334
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:37,622
Drop up to the office later, Whitey.

335
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:40,680
Link and I got something
to talk over first.

336
00:22:41,194 --> 00:22:43,719
Honey, you wouldn't mind sitting alone
for a while.

337
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:45,490
Darling, of course not.

338
00:22:45,481 --> 00:22:48,473
May I see you to your seat, Miss Porter?
Big crowd tonight.

339
00:22:47,925 --> 00:22:49,916
You needn't bother.
Thank you, Mr. Barrow.

340
00:22:50,628 --> 00:22:51,856
It'll be a pleasure.

341
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:57,323
Whitey, I haven't seen the papers.
What's new on the jockey?

342
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:58,991
Police got any leads?

343
00:22:59,829 --> 00:23:03,765
No, they don't know any more
about it than you do, Fred.

344
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:05,913
I think it was sweet of Paul to let us have
his tickets after you turned him down.

345
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:07,414
Hot dogs! A pound of meat
and a loaf of bread for a dime.

346
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:08,949
Hot dogs! A pound of meat
and a loaf of...

347
00:23:14,444 --> 00:23:18,005
Well, I'll turn in every cent I collect
if it ain't old Nick Charles.

348
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:20,907
Hiya, Nicky boy.

349
00:23:22,677 --> 00:23:26,306
Hiya, Meatballs. Honey, meet
an old pal, Meatballs Murphy.

350
00:23:27,231 --> 00:23:28,459
I'm charmed.

351
00:23:30,994 --> 00:23:33,189
- The girlfriend, Nicky?
- No, the wife.

352
00:23:32,737 --> 00:23:36,332
Well, what do you know!
Here you are, baby, a wedding present.

353
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:38,949
I wouldn't take a dime
if it was offered to me.

354
00:23:38,301 --> 00:23:41,930
Well, I don't know what to say,
Mr. Meatballs. You're too kind.

355
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:45,004
Not at all. Not at all.
Hot dogs! Last call!

356
00:23:44,416 --> 00:23:47,283
Positively none sold during the contest.

357
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:48,910
It's gonna be a great fight tonight.

358
00:23:50,813 --> 00:23:55,807
- Got the 5000, Miss Porter?
- No, not yet. Whitey, I'm afraid to ask Link.

359
00:23:55,318 --> 00:23:58,048
That's rich. You, afraid to ask for dough.

360
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:00,686
I gave you until tonight.
Now I'll see Stephens.

361
00:24:03,885 --> 00:24:06,979
- He'll be glad to hear my story.
- Whitey, listen to me, please.

362
00:24:09,057 --> 00:24:13,153
- Make it fast. My time's valuable.
- Link would never give me that much money.

363
00:24:11,943 --> 00:24:15,174
Why, you've got him eating out
of your hand.

364
00:24:14,446 --> 00:24:17,279
You know, I'm a softy myself
when it comes to women.

365
00:24:18,616 --> 00:24:22,108
Forget about the money.
I'll take this instead.

366
00:24:22,904 --> 00:24:25,737
No, you don't. Link would find out.

367
00:24:26,908 --> 00:24:30,071
Not unless you tell him.
And you won't.

368
00:24:29,911 --> 00:24:33,244
Just say you lost it.

369
00:24:33,581 --> 00:24:39,213
Presenting the Irish Thrush at 365...

370
00:24:36,584 --> 00:24:38,677
...Mike Michael!

371
00:24:39,921 --> 00:24:44,017
Presenting the Hindu champion...

372
00:24:43,424 --> 00:24:46,393
...at 333...

373
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:52,174
...Gunga Dean!

374
00:24:56,821 --> 00:24:58,482
Hiya, Nick.

375
00:25:01,109 --> 00:25:02,371
Hiya, Spider.

376
00:25:04,254 --> 00:25:06,051
Where you been?
I ain't seen you around.

377
00:25:17,175 --> 00:25:19,735
- I've been around. Where you been?
- I ain't been around.

378
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:21,535
No? In stir?

379
00:25:20,461 --> 00:25:21,951
I was a victim of circumstances.

380
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:25,703
The DA framed me, not knowing I
was guilty. Ain't that a coincidence?

381
00:25:25,158 --> 00:25:26,819
Yeah.

382
00:25:27,852 --> 00:25:29,717
Spider, I want you to meet
Mrs. Charles.

383
00:25:29,521 --> 00:25:32,354
Dear, this is Spider Webb.

384
00:25:32,974 --> 00:25:35,966
- You're Nick's wife.
- Yeah, ain't that a coincidence?

385
00:25:34,809 --> 00:25:39,371
Baby, meet Mr. and Mrs. Charles.
Folks, meet Lana.

386
00:25:36,836 --> 00:25:39,964
Any friend of Spider's is a friend of mine.

387
00:25:39,981 --> 00:25:41,642
Baby, you've arrived.

388
00:25:43,151 --> 00:25:44,482
- Says who?
- Says me.

389
00:25:47,872 --> 00:25:49,100
You're nuts.

390
00:25:53,661 --> 00:25:55,652
What are you talking about?

391
00:25:55,496 --> 00:25:57,760
Sit down! Sit down!

392
00:25:56,998 --> 00:26:00,661
Sit down! Sit down!
You wanna fight? Get in the ring!

393
00:25:58,383 --> 00:26:01,648
Hey, look at the screwy hat
on the dame.

394
00:26:00,552 --> 00:26:02,144
Enjoying the wrestling, dear?

395
00:26:03,004 --> 00:26:06,565
- Are they there?
- Why, yes, Benny. What kept you so late?

396
00:26:06,841 --> 00:26:12,177
Too many cops. They got nothing
on me, see? But I don't like them.

397
00:26:11,563 --> 00:26:14,794
Any dirt about the jock?
The one that got drilled?

398
00:27:23,584 --> 00:27:27,816
- I only know what I read in the papers.
- Yeah? Well, that ain't much.

399
00:27:27,305 --> 00:27:28,738
I'll tell Mr. Stephens.

400
00:27:34,037 --> 00:27:36,130
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- Rainbow Benny's here.

401
00:27:37,432 --> 00:27:39,332
<i>Send him in.</i>

402
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:45,172
So you got here at last.

403
00:27:44,155 --> 00:27:45,747
What's loose?

404
00:27:46,441 --> 00:27:48,102
What's the matter?

405
00:28:06,678 --> 00:28:08,908
Something gone screwy?

406
00:28:09,681 --> 00:28:11,945
Pull yourself together, Benny.

407
00:28:11,466 --> 00:28:16,028
Oh, sure, sure, Fred. I'm all right.
It's been a heavy day.

408
00:28:13,301 --> 00:28:15,633
- How heavy?
- Fifty G's, no less.

409
00:28:15,687 --> 00:28:19,054
And spread from the pine-clad hills
of Bangor to the Golden Gate...

410
00:28:18,139 --> 00:28:20,107
...with stopovers at Pittsburgh, Chicago...

411
00:28:22,861 --> 00:28:25,853
- Let's see the list.
- Sure, sure.

412
00:28:25,363 --> 00:28:27,331
Yeah?

413
00:28:28,925 --> 00:28:30,916
Tell him to wait.

414
00:28:31,035 --> 00:28:33,196
Get in the other room.

415
00:28:40,102 --> 00:28:43,765
- You don't seem glad to see me, kid.
- Mr. Stephens said you were to wait.

416
00:28:42,213 --> 00:28:44,113
Okay.

417
00:28:44,382 --> 00:28:45,644
Oh, let me by.

418
00:29:01,015 --> 00:29:03,006
What's going on here?

419
00:29:04,853 --> 00:29:07,014
Come in.

420
00:29:09,524 --> 00:29:12,493
You don't have to stand for any guff
while you're working for me.

421
00:29:11,743 --> 00:29:14,769
Thank you, Mr. Stephens.
Here's the figures on tonight's sales.

422
00:29:13,912 --> 00:29:15,174
- Thanks.
- Good night.

423
00:29:16,247 --> 00:29:18,078
Good night.

424
00:29:19,392 --> 00:29:21,292
What's on your mind?

425
00:29:22,587 --> 00:29:25,249
I don't like dead jockeys, Link.
That's what's on my mind.

426
00:29:24,038 --> 00:29:26,529
What's it to us what you like?

427
00:29:31,546 --> 00:29:34,572
It's like this. I've done the best
I could for you up till now.

428
00:29:33,598 --> 00:29:35,691
I've whitewashed you plenty
in all the papers.

429
00:29:36,434 --> 00:29:38,459
So now you're losing your nerve?
Too bad.

430
00:29:39,103 --> 00:29:42,698
But it's getting hot around here.
I need a change of air.

431
00:29:42,332 --> 00:29:46,393
I suppose you need carfare?
Would 500 help you out?

432
00:29:44,584 --> 00:29:48,111
I'm not going for a weekend, Link.
This is for good.

433
00:29:46,778 --> 00:29:48,678
I need 10,000.

434
00:29:50,565 --> 00:29:53,295
Why, that's cheap enough
for all the fixing I've done.

435
00:29:54,786 --> 00:29:58,950
That's a lot of dough, Whitey.
More than I've got on me.

436
00:29:58,907 --> 00:30:01,637
Just stick around downstairs.
We'll see you later.

437
00:30:02,627 --> 00:30:07,587
- Yeah, later, Whitey.
- Okay. Thanks. Thanks a lot.

438
00:30:06,856 --> 00:30:09,017
Looks like we could use
a new whitewasher.

439
00:30:11,194 --> 00:30:13,321
Yeah. Suits me.

440
00:30:14,088 --> 00:30:18,252
Say, boss. On the level,
is Whitey taking a powder?

441
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:23,989
Is he leaving right away?

442
00:30:24,265 --> 00:30:26,756
Suppose he is. Will you miss him?

443
00:30:27,268 --> 00:30:30,704
I hope to kiss a pig, I will.
He owes me dough.

444
00:30:31,606 --> 00:30:35,508
Eight G's. Eight. Eight G's.

445
00:30:33,825 --> 00:30:36,419
And he never said a word
to me about leaving.

446
00:30:36,494 --> 00:30:39,657
You can't trust nobody, fellas.

447
00:30:40,114 --> 00:30:42,105
- Molly, darling.
- Hello, Paul.

448
00:30:44,168 --> 00:30:46,659
Darling. You sounded worried, though.

449
00:30:46,955 --> 00:30:48,786
I've been anxious
ever since you phoned.

450
00:30:54,128 --> 00:30:56,824
I've gotta get action right away.
Have you read the papers?

451
00:31:00,635 --> 00:31:03,661
They'll stop at nothing.
That's why I'm frightened, for you.

452
00:31:03,304 --> 00:31:05,465
I can't get the goods on those crooks.

453
00:31:05,306 --> 00:31:09,072
Tonight I asked Nick Charles
if he'd help. He turned me down.

454
00:31:08,167 --> 00:31:10,032
Well, you can't blame him.

455
00:31:11,362 --> 00:31:12,989
- Waited on, sir?
- Give me some tea.

456
00:31:13,698 --> 00:31:15,256
Yes, sir.

457
00:31:17,652 --> 00:31:21,213
Help yourself until payday.
No longer, mind you.

458
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,443
Paul, what are you doing?
Paul, you mustn't!

459
00:31:21,489 --> 00:31:25,050
I'm going to search that office right now,
tonight. I made up my mind.

460
00:31:24,993 --> 00:31:28,019
Those racketeer bosses of yours
will be somewhere down in the arena.

461
00:31:29,213 --> 00:31:32,910
- They must keep records somewhere.
- But what would happen if we're caught?

462
00:31:32,166 --> 00:31:33,599
If we're caught, did you say?

463
00:31:35,887 --> 00:31:38,879
What kind of a heel do you
think you're going to marry?

464
00:31:39,115 --> 00:31:41,606
Sit tight. Have a drink.
I'll be back in a jiffy.

465
00:31:42,986 --> 00:31:45,454
I can't let you do that.
Mr. Stephens' desk is locked.

466
00:31:44,562 --> 00:31:49,363
- I haven't got a key to that.
- I'll find a way. Now, take it easy.

467
00:31:47,732 --> 00:31:51,668
Wait. Wait, Paul. You mustn't. I'm afraid.

468
00:31:50,402 --> 00:31:53,997
Back up. Keep moving.
Back into that office.

469
00:31:53,046 --> 00:31:56,209
- Now, see here, Whitey, let's...
- Let's not.

470
00:31:58,076 --> 00:32:01,068
I could drop you right on that floor
and collect a reward.

471
00:33:11,983 --> 00:33:14,884
You're a prowler. You broke in here.

472
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:20,070
Well, what were you looking for,
a stamp? Get you hands up! Up!

473
00:33:19,106 --> 00:33:21,939
So you found the family archives.

474
00:33:22,277 --> 00:33:24,837
You know, I can use that little book
in my business.

475
00:33:31,452 --> 00:33:34,478
I'll make a bargain with you.
I'll see that you get...

476
00:33:40,845 --> 00:33:42,745
Get up by the window.

477
00:33:43,848 --> 00:33:45,839
Hey there.

478
00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:50,045
- What's the matter? What is it?
- Get a doctor, quick. Call the police!

479
00:33:49,804 --> 00:33:51,795
I hope you get out of it all right.

480
00:34:52,867 --> 00:34:55,597
Thanks, lady. Good night.

481
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,125
Good night.

482
00:35:13,938 --> 00:35:16,429
- Hiya, Nick!
- lf it ain't Nick Charles.

483
00:35:16,107 --> 00:35:17,301
Nicky, pal, how's tricks?

484
00:35:19,586 --> 00:35:22,851
- You certainly got on the spot quick.
- How come you beat us here, Nick?

485
00:35:32,907 --> 00:35:35,876
We took a shortcut. Don't let us
keep you, boys, if you're busy.

486
00:35:35,577 --> 00:35:39,035
- We've got plenty of time.
- So you've got plenty of time, huh?

487
00:35:36,936 --> 00:35:39,700
Why, you anemic pack of bloodhounds,
there's been a murder.

488
00:35:40,389 --> 00:35:43,051
Rigor mortis is setting in,
and you lounge here gabbing!

489
00:35:43,526 --> 00:35:45,517
Come on, upstairs!

490
00:35:47,138 --> 00:35:50,403
Well, folks, here we are again,
and here's another murder.

491
00:35:50,091 --> 00:35:52,184
Say, did the Irish Thrush win?
He's my cousin.

492
00:35:52,927 --> 00:35:55,452
Either I'm dreaming,
or I've lived through this before.

493
00:35:55,738 --> 00:35:58,639
- I meet you at all my homicides.
- We won't be at this one long.

494
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:01,778
Maybe not, but a friend of yours will.

495
00:36:01,435 --> 00:36:05,599
Two newspapermen just had it out.
One of them is now dead.

496
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:06,894
The other is Paul Clarke.

497
00:36:07,216 --> 00:36:09,548
Paul? Come along, Nick.

498
00:36:09,994 --> 00:36:13,259
I don't know what happened.
We had a fight. I was knocked cold.

499
00:36:14,332 --> 00:36:17,733
You were knocked cold? I suppose
Whitey's just taking a nap in there.

500
00:36:17,285 --> 00:36:19,685
- I didn't kill him.
- Hey, come back here, you!

501
00:36:20,004 --> 00:36:23,030
- Paul, I thought you'd been killed.
- You shouldn't have come.

502
00:36:23,458 --> 00:36:26,052
- I told you to keep people out.
- She busted right by me.

503
00:36:27,011 --> 00:36:28,342
- Pardon me.
- That key's mine.

504
00:36:29,606 --> 00:36:31,597
It wasn't Paul's. I gave it to him.

505
00:36:32,801 --> 00:36:37,261
Oh, so that's how you got in here.
This girl was in it with you. Who are you?

506
00:36:35,578 --> 00:36:37,569
- I work here.
- Nice work.

507
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,378
He came to get evidence.
That's all. I helped him.

508
00:36:39,249 --> 00:36:41,444
I knew it was wrong,
but it isn't murder.

509
00:36:43,861 --> 00:36:47,228
Nicky, do something before they both
convict themselves.

510
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,691
- Is this your gun?
- No.

511
00:36:48,508 --> 00:36:50,874
No, it was Whitey's.
And it hasn't been fired.

512
00:36:50,868 --> 00:36:53,598
So it hasn't been fired.

513
00:36:54,539 --> 00:36:58,441
Then it's using a new perfume,
Burnt Powder.

514
00:36:56,374 --> 00:36:59,832
I didn't fire it. I came up here
to get Stephens' records...

515
00:36:58,935 --> 00:37:01,665
...and I found them in his desk
in a black book.

516
00:37:02,163 --> 00:37:05,132
- Where is it?
- Barrow took it. Why, he had the gun.

517
00:37:06,217 --> 00:37:09,209
There's no book in Stephens' desk,
on you or in Barrow's pockets.

518
00:37:09,862 --> 00:37:13,855
Paul's telling the truth. There was a book.
Ask Mr. Stephens. Or Mr. Macy.

519
00:37:12,782 --> 00:37:14,943
When I get to them.

520
00:37:15,893 --> 00:37:19,294
I sure wish that watchman could
describe the guy he almost caught.

521
00:37:19,064 --> 00:37:20,292
Almost caught?

522
00:37:23,234 --> 00:37:26,397
Someone was running down the stairs
right after the shot was fired.

523
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:29,233
It was too dark to get a description.
Let's take another look inside.

524
00:37:29,858 --> 00:37:32,691
Keep those lovebirds apart.
They might try to cook up a story.

525
00:37:31,242 --> 00:37:34,040
What if they do?
You didn't care for the first one.

526
00:37:34,579 --> 00:37:37,810
Nicky will get you out of it,
just like that.

527
00:37:38,416 --> 00:37:40,680
Well, doc?

528
00:37:41,419 --> 00:37:42,681
Shot.

529
00:37:47,375 --> 00:37:50,105
No kidding. I thought maybe he drowned.

530
00:37:53,523 --> 00:37:56,185
Can you tell us when he left
this nice peaceful world?

531
00:37:55,933 --> 00:37:58,299
Dead approximately half an hour.

532
00:37:57,385 --> 00:37:59,444
There's quite a lump
on the back of his head.

533
00:38:00,271 --> 00:38:03,934
- They tap hard in his fraternity.
- A large bruise, not serious.

534
00:38:03,108 --> 00:38:06,976
- Well, lucky for Barrow it isn't serious.
- But he isn't supposed to have a bruise.

535
00:38:05,668 --> 00:38:08,364
- Clarke claims he bumped his head.
- No contusion on Clarke.

536
00:38:07,895 --> 00:38:10,489
He may have struck his head
on the desk, but no mark.

537
00:38:11,733 --> 00:38:15,897
Which often happens. What about
the angle of the bullet? Downwards, huh?

538
00:38:15,762 --> 00:38:18,162
- How did you know that?
- Very simple.

539
00:38:18,623 --> 00:38:20,750
Paul is only a little taller
than Whitey...

540
00:38:21,409 --> 00:38:24,207
...so I figure he must have been
hanging on the chandelier...

541
00:38:25,747 --> 00:38:27,738
...when he shot him,
or standing on a chair.

542
00:38:28,299 --> 00:38:29,926
Any footprints on the chairs?

543
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:33,135
- What are you driving at, Nick?
- Me for downtown.

544
00:38:33,588 --> 00:38:38,150
It looks to me as if Whitey must have been
lying on the floor when he got it.

545
00:38:35,757 --> 00:38:39,090
Clarke's a fine sportsman.
He could've at least shot him on the rise.

546
00:38:37,567 --> 00:38:40,058
I'll send the boys for the body.

547
00:38:40,261 --> 00:38:44,425
Let's suppose, for the moment,
that some third party...

548
00:38:44,983 --> 00:38:46,974
...saw Paul and Whitey fight.

549
00:38:48,486 --> 00:38:52,980
Let's assume that the third party
saw Paul go down. Out cold.

550
00:38:51,823 --> 00:38:54,485
The gun had been kicked right
at his feet, let's say.

551
00:38:56,161 --> 00:38:57,924
All right, let's say.

552
00:38:58,329 --> 00:39:02,993
Our third party could have picked up
the gun, slugged Whitey from behind...

553
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,969
...which accounts for that bruise
on the back of Whitey's head...

554
00:39:05,837 --> 00:39:09,204
...and taken the book from his pocket.
- Sorry, Nick, it won't jell.

555
00:39:07,789 --> 00:39:10,485
Why should this party
of the third party shoot Whitey...

556
00:39:12,627 --> 00:39:15,755
...after he knocked him cold and took
the book? If there was a book.

557
00:39:15,772 --> 00:39:19,173
I'll say that Whitey came to
and recognized him.

558
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:22,463
Our third party had to shoot him,
leaving Paul to take the rap.

559
00:39:22,162 --> 00:39:26,064
As far as I'm concerned, there isn't
any third party and there isn't any book.

560
00:39:25,473 --> 00:39:27,964
I'm sorry to pick on your friend,
but I'm booking him.

561
00:39:29,027 --> 00:39:32,690
If I didn't, I'd have the DA
down my throat, and is he a pill.

562
00:39:32,647 --> 00:39:35,480
I'd like to have a look at that stuff
Whitey had on him.

563
00:39:36,701 --> 00:39:40,398
Sure, out here. It's just the usual junk.
Help yourself.

564
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:42,032
But what was Whitey doing in here,
and how did he get in?

565
00:39:43,208 --> 00:39:45,768
Hello, lieutenant.
What's going on here?

566
00:39:46,211 --> 00:39:48,873
Evening, Nick. Hello, Mrs. Charles.

567
00:39:51,332 --> 00:39:53,664
Can you figure heads or tails
on this affair?

568
00:39:54,169 --> 00:39:57,002
- I just walked into the arena...
- I was in the ticket office.

569
00:39:56,888 --> 00:39:58,947
What more do you want?

570
00:39:59,724 --> 00:40:01,988
Relax. Relax, Fred.
They won't keep us long.

571
00:40:02,226 --> 00:40:06,560
Hello, lieutenant. Oh, you here too.
What's this, a convention?

572
00:40:05,229 --> 00:40:08,096
Cheer up, maybe the lieutenant
will let you sell tickets.

573
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:10,618
All right. All right.
This is all we found on Barrow.

574
00:40:09,901 --> 00:40:11,994
If there was a record book,
it crawled away.

575
00:40:14,405 --> 00:40:16,635
Well, what record book?
There's no record book.

576
00:40:17,467 --> 00:40:21,961
We'll take you first, since you're so upset.
Where were you from 9 to 10?

577
00:40:20,745 --> 00:40:23,737
I was in the ticket office.
I never left it. Ask Maguire.

578
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:25,521
Right. He was in the ticket office.
He never left it.

579
00:40:25,416 --> 00:40:27,907
- Doing what?
- Checking up on the ticket sales.

580
00:40:30,088 --> 00:40:31,851
He was checking up
on the ticket sales.

581
00:40:33,266 --> 00:40:36,758
At 10, I went out for a sandwich,
then took a little drive.

582
00:40:33,258 --> 00:40:36,489
- Any law against that?
- Not if you got a driver's license.

583
00:40:35,927 --> 00:40:39,522
By the way, Macy,
what was the total ticket sale?

584
00:40:38,596 --> 00:40:40,587
Why...

585
00:40:40,548 --> 00:40:42,277
I should have telegraphed that one.

586
00:40:44,219 --> 00:40:48,383
Mr. Stephens, do you mind telling us
where you were from 9 to 10?

587
00:40:47,605 --> 00:40:50,073
I was with a lady, a Miss Porter.

588
00:40:51,392 --> 00:40:54,589
Nicky, do you see this laundry list
from Barrow's pocket?

589
00:40:53,561 --> 00:40:56,724
- Yeah, we'll get to it later.
- It's a woman's laundry list.

590
00:40:55,446 --> 00:40:59,940
- Well, maybe he had a wife.
- Twenty-five kimonos? That's a harem.

591
00:40:59,784 --> 00:41:02,184
I'd like to run along, lieutenant,
if you're through.

592
00:41:02,428 --> 00:41:05,864
Oh, just a minute. Bloodhound.

593
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:10,693
Lieutenant, I think this laundry list
of Barrow's might interest you.

594
00:41:09,127 --> 00:41:13,257
Three bloomers, 25 kimonos, 10 slips...

595
00:41:13,798 --> 00:41:16,790
...five panties, 15 chemises.

596
00:41:16,392 --> 00:41:18,121
Sounds like washday at Vassar.

597
00:41:20,421 --> 00:41:22,548
That's the list that was
in Stephens' ledger...

598
00:41:26,286 --> 00:41:27,810
...the one I found in the drawer.

599
00:41:30,598 --> 00:41:33,499
Apparently the slip and the ledger
parted company somewhere.

600
00:41:33,768 --> 00:41:35,963
Just a minute, major.

601
00:41:35,653 --> 00:41:38,451
What did Hotbox pay in that race
you're investigating?

602
00:41:37,964 --> 00:41:39,591
Seventeen to one.

603
00:41:39,666 --> 00:41:43,295
See here, lieutenant.
The laundry mark is GP.

604
00:41:39,657 --> 00:41:43,320
- Now, that could stand for Greenway Park.
- Go on, Nick. I'm listening.

605
00:41:42,752 --> 00:41:44,515
The weight of the bundle, 17.

606
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,738
Well, either that's a lot of laundry,
or it's the odds on Hotbox.

607
00:41:48,258 --> 00:41:51,022
Seventeen to one.
Twenty-five kimonos.

608
00:41:50,059 --> 00:41:54,052
K. K. Maybe K for Kansas City, 25,000.

609
00:41:53,838 --> 00:41:55,430
They got some big bookies there.

610
00:41:57,675 --> 00:42:02,408
Fifteen chemises. C for Chicago?
Fifteen thousand bet there?

611
00:41:59,627 --> 00:42:03,393
- Say, now we're getting somewhere.
- Yeah, up crick.

612
00:42:03,273 --> 00:42:04,763
- Mr. Stephens.
- Yeah.

613
00:42:06,184 --> 00:42:09,984
Could this, by coincidence, be your list
of out-of-town bets on that race?

614
00:42:10,355 --> 00:42:13,586
- Keep swinging, lieutenant.
- I'd like to look into this, Nick.

615
00:42:12,139 --> 00:42:14,573
It may help the committee in its work.

616
00:42:17,028 --> 00:42:18,791
- What work?
- Work that'll put an end...

617
00:42:21,532 --> 00:42:23,864
...to your kind of vermin.
- There wasn't a book...

618
00:42:23,201 --> 00:42:25,294
...so Clarke never saw one.
- That's not true.

619
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,841
I've seen him making entries.

620
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,761
He and Whitey had an argument
in there tonight.

621
00:42:33,186 --> 00:42:35,916
She's Clarke's girl
and obviously a double-crosser.

622
00:42:35,138 --> 00:42:37,504
Took salary from me
while she was spying for him.

623
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,870
- Miss Porter is your girl, isn't she?
- Yes.

624
00:42:39,884 --> 00:42:44,344
Does that let her out?
She's your alibi, your only alibi.

625
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:44,518
I don't think I'll say any more
without my lawyer.

626
00:42:44,055 --> 00:42:48,219
All right, you can go now.
You too. But stay where I can find you.

627
00:42:46,983 --> 00:42:49,315
Good luck, Nick.

628
00:42:49,511 --> 00:42:54,175
- What really worries me is that jockey.
- Yeah. Still dead, huh?

629
00:42:51,896 --> 00:42:55,491
But since I've got two murderers to catch,
it's nice to have one in the bag.

630
00:42:56,542 --> 00:42:58,942
Five dollars will get you 10
there's only one murderer.

631
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,455
- There's no connection.
- I'm still betting there's one murderer.

632
00:43:04,242 --> 00:43:06,142
Well, this is one bet I'll win.

633
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:12,845
Sorry, Clarke, I'll have to take you
downtown. You too, Miss Ford.

634
00:43:14,419 --> 00:43:17,354
You can't arrest her.
She's done nothing at all.

635
00:43:18,206 --> 00:43:21,539
She let you in, son.
That gives her credit for an assist.

636
00:43:20,759 --> 00:43:21,987
- Riley!
- Yes, sir?

637
00:43:23,878 --> 00:43:27,541
Stay with the body until they take it away.
Come on, folks.

638
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:31,266
- Chin up. I'll split that 5 with you, Paul.
- Nick, you can just mail me the 10 bucks.

639
00:43:29,384 --> 00:43:31,978
In a way, I'm responsible
for Paul's being in this jam.

640
00:43:32,495 --> 00:43:35,555
He was helping me. If there was
something I could do to help him...

641
00:43:35,999 --> 00:43:38,331
- I'll call on you.
- Good night, Nick. Mrs. Charles.

642
00:43:37,392 --> 00:43:43,126
Good night. Nicky, do you really think
there was only one murderer?

643
00:43:41,229 --> 00:43:43,060
- Why?
- Hunch.

644
00:43:47,068 --> 00:43:49,229
- About what?
- Shower.

645
00:43:49,846 --> 00:43:53,577
- Where the jockey was shot? What about it?
- Don't know yet.

646
00:43:53,074 --> 00:43:54,473
You gonna examine it?

647
00:43:55,576 --> 00:43:58,841
- Okay, let's go.
- Mama goes home.

648
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:05,344
Oh, Nicky, you know you click better
when I'm around.

649
00:44:04,252 --> 00:44:05,879
Not in a men's shower.

650
00:44:06,588 --> 00:44:10,547
I'll tell you what. You go home,
cold cream that lovely face...

651
00:44:10,475 --> 00:44:12,739
...slip into an exciting negligee...

652
00:44:12,068 --> 00:44:14,935
- Yes?
- And I'll see you at breakfast.

653
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,311
- Hiya, Henry.
- Hi, Mr. Charles.

654
00:44:18,766 --> 00:44:20,825
I've been waiting for you.
Everything's open.

655
00:44:20,577 --> 00:44:22,670
All right, fine.
I'm very much obliged to you.

656
00:44:25,214 --> 00:44:26,977
Gee, that's a nice pup you have there.

657
00:44:27,633 --> 00:44:30,727
Not too loud.
He could get a swelled head.

658
00:44:35,174 --> 00:44:37,438
He's a brave little fella, isn't he?

659
00:44:37,168 --> 00:44:39,398
Say, they don't come any braver.

660
00:44:39,429 --> 00:44:41,989
That dog would fight tigers for me.

661
00:44:41,672 --> 00:44:43,333
Asta.

662
00:44:43,624 --> 00:44:45,489
You bully.

663
00:44:48,629 --> 00:44:50,358
A clue?

664
00:44:51,074 --> 00:44:54,373
Well, good boy.

665
00:44:53,468 --> 00:44:55,993
I think this will work, Asta.

666
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:03,283
Now, if our hook just holds.

667
00:45:02,285 --> 00:45:04,344
There we are.

668
00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:45,649
What do you think of that?
And without any bait.

669
00:45:46,571 --> 00:45:49,597
Asta, not a word of this.

670
00:46:00,868 --> 00:46:04,702
- Stick them up, or I'll blow you in two.
- Don't shoot, Nicky! It's me!

671
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:08,907
Why, Mrs. Charles.

672
00:46:09,594 --> 00:46:10,822
Well, followed me, huh?

673
00:46:12,655 --> 00:46:15,681
- Nicky, help me.
- Why, sure, sure, I'll help you.

674
00:46:16,601 --> 00:46:18,831
Well, is that what you were
trying to do for me?

675
00:46:59,761 --> 00:47:02,093
I was just trying to show you
you can't neglect me.

676
00:47:05,099 --> 00:47:06,327
I might've shot you.

677
00:47:08,128 --> 00:47:12,690
Even that's better than staying
home alone. Here, hold this.

678
00:47:09,521 --> 00:47:11,352
I like the way you sneaked up on me.

679
00:47:09,546 --> 00:47:12,242
I was doing all right
until the wind closed the door...

680
00:47:12,749 --> 00:47:14,273
...and everything went black.

681
00:47:15,135 --> 00:47:17,865
- Nicky, what'd you find in the shower?
- Evidence.

682
00:47:17,637 --> 00:47:20,003
Really? Then you know
who killed the jockey?

683
00:47:19,055 --> 00:47:20,545
Who?

684
00:47:23,785 --> 00:47:29,985
Stephens, Macy, Claire Porter,
Maguire, Molly, Paul Clarke...

685
00:47:25,787 --> 00:47:30,190
...Lieutenant Abrams, Asta, Nicky,
you, me.

686
00:47:28,648 --> 00:47:31,048
What are you doing, young fella,
chasing a tiger?

687
00:47:30,341 --> 00:47:34,402
Say, Mr. Charles,
you done all right in there.

688
00:47:33,269 --> 00:47:35,703
Oh, it's you, Mrs. Charles.

689
00:47:35,797 --> 00:47:39,130
Gee, Mrs. Charles,
that's quite a hat, ain't it?

690
00:47:37,824 --> 00:47:39,416
Where did you get a hat like that?

691
00:47:44,189 --> 00:47:48,455
- You like it?
- You bet. Screwy, ain't it?

692
00:47:50,311 --> 00:47:52,370
You can have it!

693
00:47:52,864 --> 00:47:55,628
You don't know nothing.
Nobody knows nothing.

694
00:47:57,126 --> 00:48:00,095
People are getting murdered,
but nobody knows nothing.

695
00:47:59,704 --> 00:48:04,073
Benny. Benny, after you saw Stephens
in the office last night...

696
00:48:03,208 --> 00:48:04,903
...did you go back again?

697
00:48:04,992 --> 00:48:09,725
No, sir. Honest, I told you all I know.

698
00:48:09,664 --> 00:48:12,098
That's the truth, so help me, captain.

699
00:48:15,895 --> 00:48:19,194
Flattery won't get you anywhere.
I'm a lieutenant.

700
00:48:18,848 --> 00:48:23,342
But I'd like to be a captain.
Now, think. Think.

701
00:48:21,993 --> 00:48:26,225
What connection did Whitey Barrow
have with Stephens and Macy?

702
00:48:26,523 --> 00:48:30,459
Why, none. None that I know of.

703
00:48:28,383 --> 00:48:30,749
On the level, I seen him around
once in a while...

704
00:48:33,304 --> 00:48:35,499
...but they always got newspapermen
around.

705
00:48:35,890 --> 00:48:37,517
- Hiya, Nick.
- Hello, Mr. Charles.

706
00:48:39,369 --> 00:48:41,098
Lieutenant. Hiya, Benny.

707
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,871
I can go now, huh, captain?

708
00:48:48,428 --> 00:48:52,524
Yeah. But stick around.
Don't get any notions to travel.

709
00:48:52,857 --> 00:48:55,519
Not me. No, sir. Thanks.

710
00:48:55,385 --> 00:48:59,845
- So long. So long, Mr. Charles.
- So long.

711
00:48:57,746 --> 00:49:01,147
You'd think Stephens' betting commissioner
would know about the inside...

712
00:48:59,556 --> 00:49:01,387
...but that guy's like a clam.

713
00:49:01,441 --> 00:49:05,605
Lieutenant, how would you like
to buy a gun?

714
00:49:03,443 --> 00:49:06,071
Say, for $5?

715
00:49:07,731 --> 00:49:11,428
I got a gun. Five doll...?

716
00:49:10,567 --> 00:49:12,660
Say, what is this, Nick?

717
00:49:15,213 --> 00:49:17,977
- That's the gun that killed the jockey.
- Nick! That's great!

718
00:49:18,767 --> 00:49:22,032
- Where did you find it?
- In the drainpipe in the shower.

719
00:49:20,769 --> 00:49:22,703
I should have found that.

720
00:49:25,106 --> 00:49:27,904
But that's all right. We'll trace the gun.

721
00:49:27,917 --> 00:49:30,852
Nick, how did you know
where to look for it?

722
00:49:32,138 --> 00:49:34,436
Well, the angle of the bullet was peculiar.

723
00:49:34,424 --> 00:49:38,087
It entered his eye and went upward
toward the top of his head.

724
00:49:37,369 --> 00:49:41,032
Well, if he'd been shot
from the window...

725
00:49:40,789 --> 00:49:44,850
...he would have had to be holding
his head back like this, which is unlikely.

726
00:49:42,907 --> 00:49:44,932
The most logical place the bullet
came from...

727
00:49:45,852 --> 00:49:47,217
- Was below.
- You've got it.

728
00:49:45,877 --> 00:49:49,108
Sure I have. What have I got?

729
00:49:48,963 --> 00:49:51,898
Lieutenant, the jockey wasn't murdered.

730
00:49:51,441 --> 00:49:55,070
Suicide? You mean, he killed himself
and then hid the gun?

731
00:49:55,278 --> 00:49:57,610
No, he hid the gun
and then killed himself.

732
00:49:59,115 --> 00:50:02,175
He may have been thinking of suicide
when he went into the shower.

733
00:50:03,345 --> 00:50:04,835
Perhaps he lost his nerve.

734
00:50:03,336 --> 00:50:06,100
At all events, he wanted to get rid
of the gun.

735
00:50:05,563 --> 00:50:08,498
So he opened the cover
of the drainpipe...

736
00:50:07,290 --> 00:50:10,350
...dropped the gun down, butt first.

737
00:50:10,935 --> 00:50:15,634
The hammer of the gun hit a curve
in the drainpipe, and the gun went off.

738
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:17,429
And when the body fell forward,
it closed the drainpipe.

739
00:50:17,942 --> 00:50:19,739
Lieutenant, you've solved it.

740
00:50:20,779 --> 00:50:25,478
Well, you've helped me. Nick,
this is one bet I don't mind losing.

741
00:50:23,999 --> 00:50:26,729
Thanks to you, I've only got
one murder on my hands.

742
00:50:25,667 --> 00:50:28,500
Will I be glad to tell that
to those newshounds.

743
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:30,053
If there's anything I can do...

744
00:50:31,698 --> 00:50:34,724
Just one thing. Let me give the story
to the reporters...

745
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:38,521
...and let me do it in my way.
- Pal, your way is my way.

746
00:50:39,823 --> 00:50:41,688
- What's cooking?
- Did Paul Clarke crack?

747
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:47,220
Gentlemen, there's the gun
that killed Goldez.

748
00:50:46,162 --> 00:50:48,824
Lieutenant Abrams found it
in the drainpipe of the shower.

749
00:50:51,026 --> 00:50:52,254
Yeah?

750
00:50:53,945 --> 00:50:55,879
Whoever shot Goldez hid it there, right?

751
00:50:56,948 --> 00:50:59,610
Right! And when we find the murderer
of Goldez...

752
00:50:58,533 --> 00:51:00,433
...we'll find the murderer of Barrow too.

753
00:51:01,728 --> 00:51:03,389
Both were rubbed out
by the same guy.

754
00:51:05,490 --> 00:51:07,890
Both of them knew too much
for somebody's safety...

755
00:51:07,517 --> 00:51:10,714
...so they had to be silenced. Right?
- No... Yeah.

756
00:51:10,737 --> 00:51:12,637
- What about Paul Clarke?
- Paul's innocent.

757
00:51:13,573 --> 00:51:16,406
- He'll be released. Right, lieutenant?
- Yeah, right. No! Yeah.

758
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,436
- That's all, boys.
- Thanks for the story.

759
00:51:17,077 --> 00:51:18,738
Hey, Nick. What is this?

760
00:51:19,913 --> 00:51:26,375
Lieutenant, look. Everybody but you
and me thinks that Goldez was murdered.

761
00:51:22,007 --> 00:51:24,373
Whoever killed Barrow thinks so too.

762
00:51:23,842 --> 00:51:28,404
Now, when he reads that we think the
jockey's murderer committed both crimes...

763
00:51:26,394 --> 00:51:29,056
...he may try to help us find
that murderer.

764
00:51:29,756 --> 00:51:32,350
You mean he'll try to frame
a substitute for Paul Clarke?

765
00:51:31,850 --> 00:51:33,249
Well, that's what I'm hoping.

766
00:51:34,853 --> 00:51:37,481
Now, if he snaps at our bait,
that's where you come in.

767
00:51:39,215 --> 00:51:43,743
Sure I do. Sure I do.
Where do I come in?

768
00:51:41,051 --> 00:51:43,986
Why, don't you see? You'll be
the first policeman in history...

769
00:51:47,699 --> 00:51:51,191
...to use a fake murder
to solve a real one.

770
00:51:50,226 --> 00:51:52,057
What?

771
00:51:54,948 --> 00:51:56,176
Sure.

772
00:51:57,784 --> 00:51:59,274
I'd like to talk to Mr. Charles.

773
00:52:00,570 --> 00:52:03,130
- He ain't here. Who's calling?
- It's very important.

774
00:52:02,122 --> 00:52:03,783
Who is it, Stella?

775
00:52:04,933 --> 00:52:06,332
Hello there. Come in.

776
00:52:09,629 --> 00:52:12,097
I gotta see Mr. Charles.
I got some information.

777
00:52:12,749 --> 00:52:14,444
I only got a couple of minutes.

778
00:52:16,419 --> 00:52:18,512
Mr. Charles isn't here.
Can you give it to me?

779
00:52:18,421 --> 00:52:22,915
No, I gotta give it to him. I'm going
away, see? And I gotta give it to him.

780
00:52:25,253 --> 00:52:28,347
All right, you wait.
I'll get him on the phone.

781
00:52:26,921 --> 00:52:29,788
Hello? Mr. Charles?

782
00:52:29,641 --> 00:52:31,268
Oh, hello, Nicky, darling.

783
00:52:31,476 --> 00:52:34,775
Mr. Maguire is here.
Yes, from the arena.

784
00:52:33,069 --> 00:52:35,094
He's got some important information
for you.

785
00:52:35,705 --> 00:52:38,606
- He has to give it to you right away.
- Let me talk to him.

786
00:52:37,574 --> 00:52:40,907
Yes, I'll be sure to get
the information correctly. Bye.

787
00:52:39,826 --> 00:52:43,387
Mr. Charles wants you to talk to me.
So you sit right down here.

788
00:52:44,489 --> 00:52:49,688
He's very busy
in a very important conference. Now.

789
00:52:56,142 --> 00:52:59,634
Okay. Now, this is what
I want Nick to know.

790
00:52:59,170 --> 00:53:01,604
Last night, I was in the ticket office...

791
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:04,575
- Daddy, get another ring.
- Another one?

792
00:53:04,459 --> 00:53:07,951
- Here you are.
- Daddy, get another ring, for this finger.

793
00:53:06,653 --> 00:53:09,087
Hey, I'm groggy now.

794
00:53:09,739 --> 00:53:13,266
Go on, Daddy. You ride that one.

795
00:53:13,243 --> 00:53:17,202
Not me. Daddy go so far,
but no further.

796
00:53:16,971 --> 00:53:22,238
He's afraid. Fraidy-cat! Fraidy-cat!
Big man's a fraidy-cat!

797
00:53:24,362 --> 00:53:27,388
Look! Look!
He's scared to get on the dragon!

798
00:53:28,032 --> 00:53:31,160
Look at that big scaredy-cat!
Afraid to get on the dragon!

799
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:41,076
He is not! He is not afraid!

800
00:53:44,833 --> 00:53:47,131
You're not afraid, are you, Daddy?

801
00:53:48,503 --> 00:53:50,494
Sure.

802
00:53:53,675 --> 00:53:57,873
No, no, I'm not a fraidy-cat.
I was just fooling.

803
00:53:57,679 --> 00:54:00,580
Yeah, fooling.

804
00:54:01,825 --> 00:54:04,794
Hey, you, let go of my tiger.

805
00:54:07,238 --> 00:54:10,674
- Get off our boat.
- Get off our boat!

806
00:54:10,442 --> 00:54:15,072
- I told you he was afraid!
- Big guy's a coward!

807
00:54:10,467 --> 00:54:14,164
<i>Fraidy-cat, fraidy-cat!</i>
<i>The big man's a fraidy-cat.</i>

808
00:54:13,745 --> 00:54:16,908
<i>Fraidy-cat, fraidy-cat!</i>

809
00:54:16,306 --> 00:54:19,707
There, who's a fraidy-cat?
Who's a fraidy-cat?

810
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:20,911
Who's a fraidy-cat?

811
00:54:23,897 --> 00:54:26,559
Enjoying the merry-go-round, darling?

812
00:54:29,711 --> 00:54:31,303
Nicky, I've got to talk to you.

813
00:54:38,745 --> 00:54:40,713
Nicky!

814
00:54:44,609 --> 00:54:46,543
Nicky, I've got to talk to you.

815
00:55:08,691 --> 00:55:10,352
What's up?

816
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:16,415
It's stopping. It's stopping.

817
00:55:13,471 --> 00:55:17,168
Would you like some nice raw oysters,
dear, or a dish of salt pork?

818
00:55:17,367 --> 00:55:18,698
It's nice sleuthing, Mommy.

819
00:55:21,930 --> 00:55:24,990
Thank you, darling.
Are you going to see Macy?

820
00:55:25,483 --> 00:55:27,508
No, Claire Porter.

821
00:55:51,459 --> 00:55:54,019
I had a feeling you'd be working
that angle before long.

822
00:55:59,634 --> 00:56:01,295
All in the line of duty.

823
00:56:01,853 --> 00:56:04,014
Gee, you were swell, Daddy.

824
00:56:05,165 --> 00:56:07,998
Thank you, sonny.
Tomorrow I'll buy you an earthquake.

825
00:56:10,028 --> 00:56:12,121
Come on, let's get away
from that Mickey Finn.

826
00:56:53,855 --> 00:56:56,415
- Where's Asta?
- What?

827
00:57:14,926 --> 00:57:17,258
I'm very flattered at your visit,
Mr. Charles.

828
00:57:20,549 --> 00:57:25,248
But if it's about the case,
I don't think I can help you.

829
00:57:22,050 --> 00:57:25,781
You see, I hardly knew Mr. Barrow.

830
00:57:25,270 --> 00:57:28,262
You didn't miss much. He wasn't
exactly one of nature's noblemen.

831
00:57:27,497 --> 00:57:29,226
Really?

832
00:57:30,225 --> 00:57:33,353
Well, how nice.

833
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:36,793
- A camellia doesn't have any fragrance.
- It doesn't need any around you.

834
00:57:34,396 --> 00:57:39,356
I'm glad you like my perfume. It's new.
It's called Out of This World.

835
00:57:37,399 --> 00:57:40,664
Out of This World. Well, that brings us
back to Whitey Barrow.

836
00:57:39,676 --> 00:57:42,543
He was talking with someone,
having an argument in a corner...

837
00:57:46,741 --> 00:57:48,368
...at the arena last night.

838
00:57:49,244 --> 00:57:51,144
That's rather important
in a murder case.

839
00:57:54,107 --> 00:57:56,701
I see. And you thought
it might have been me.

840
00:57:58,028 --> 00:58:02,192
Well, it was a girl about your size.
I thought it might be well to run down...

841
00:58:01,197 --> 00:58:04,030
...the lead without checking
with the police first.

842
00:58:05,310 --> 00:58:08,871
I can't imagine
why you should think that...

843
00:58:10,482 --> 00:58:12,450
Do you know, I think
it might have been me.

844
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:20,008
I was standing in the lobby
with Mr. Stephens when Whitey...

845
00:58:21,993 --> 00:58:25,895
Mr. Barrow came along,
and he took me to my seat.

846
00:58:25,447 --> 00:58:28,712
- On the way, we stopped to chat.
- Oh, well.

847
00:58:28,475 --> 00:58:30,409
I'm glad you remembered.

848
00:58:30,285 --> 00:58:34,551
It was silly of me to forget.
But it wasn't an argument.

849
00:58:32,337 --> 00:58:35,534
On the contrary, we just...

850
00:58:35,123 --> 00:58:38,752
We just chatted about...
About a mutual friend.

851
00:58:39,461 --> 00:58:41,452
Don't we all?

852
00:58:42,464 --> 00:58:44,261
Well, I'm glad we cleared it up.

853
00:58:50,997 --> 00:58:54,831
Now I can forget about it
and concentrate on prettier things.

854
00:58:53,141 --> 00:58:56,736
You know, you're really not
like a detective at all, Mr. Charles.

855
00:58:57,620 --> 00:59:02,284
You don't pound the table
or shout or threaten.

856
00:59:01,675 --> 00:59:03,267
I'm not really a detective.

857
00:59:05,128 --> 00:59:08,154
I just use that as an excuse
to get out of the house at night.

858
00:59:07,205 --> 00:59:10,538
I don't suppose you enjoyed
those wrestling bouts very much last night.

859
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:14,288
- You left quite early, huh?
- I found it a bit too brutal.

860
00:59:15,021 --> 00:59:16,249
It gave me a headache.

861
00:59:20,001 --> 00:59:22,629
Yes, especially when that fat clown
broke his arm.

862
00:59:22,504 --> 00:59:24,597
That was dreadful.

863
00:59:24,481 --> 00:59:26,574
But that was next to the last bout.

864
00:59:28,869 --> 00:59:31,497
Then Mr. Stephens didn't take you home
before the murder.

865
00:59:32,656 --> 00:59:37,593
Yes, he did. I didn't see that bout.
I read about it in the morning papers.

866
00:59:37,661 --> 00:59:40,596
You are a detective after all.

867
00:59:39,404 --> 00:59:42,339
Why did Whitey Barrow have
to take you into a secluded corner...

868
00:59:43,858 --> 00:59:45,519
...to chat about a mutual friend?

869
00:59:47,362 --> 00:59:49,660
We just happened to meet
in a secluded corner.

870
00:59:50,173 --> 00:59:53,802
Really, Mr. Charles, this cross-examination
is becoming a bit tiresome.

871
00:59:51,558 --> 00:59:56,359
I'm sorry, but you said that Barrow
was taking you to your seat.

872
00:59:54,369 --> 00:59:56,803
- Why the detour?
- None of your business!

873
00:59:57,923 --> 00:59:59,447
I'm not on trial.

874
01:00:00,208 --> 01:00:01,539
Not yet.

875
01:00:03,019 --> 01:00:06,182
That's what I deserve for letting
a double-crossing cop in the door.

876
01:00:11,219 --> 01:00:12,743
Get out.

877
01:00:14,773 --> 01:00:16,434
Get out.

878
01:00:17,893 --> 01:00:21,488
- Thanks for the camellia.
- And don't come back!

879
01:00:19,728 --> 01:00:23,061
Don't look now,
but your accent's showing.

880
01:00:22,205 --> 01:00:25,641
Baku, did you hear what he said?

881
01:00:26,009 --> 01:00:28,273
Get the car while I get dressed.

882
01:00:30,956 --> 01:00:35,052
Murder Time, <i>with the compliments</i>
<i>of Dr. Fang, your friendly dentist.</i>

883
01:00:33,575 --> 01:00:37,375
<i>Folks, do you have shabby teeth?</i>
<i>Do you have aching teeth?</i>

884
01:00:36,077 --> 01:00:37,704
<i>Do you have teeth? You don't?</i>

885
01:00:37,579 --> 01:00:39,706
How do you do?

886
01:00:40,915 --> 01:00:43,213
What's your racket, buddy,
brushes or magazines?

887
01:00:49,474 --> 01:00:54,275
I have police permission to look over
Mr. Barrow's apartment.

888
01:00:51,977 --> 01:00:55,708
- You wanna case the joint, eh?
- Yes, I'd like to glom the layout.

889
01:00:55,764 --> 01:00:58,392
But the coppers snooped
all through there this a.m.

890
01:01:03,154 --> 01:01:05,987
But this is the p.m., and I've got
another angle on Barrow.

891
01:01:07,417 --> 01:01:09,612
That grifter owed me two months' rent.

892
01:01:28,830 --> 01:01:32,027
The slug he got saved me the trouble
of tossing him out on his ear.

893
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:35,658
Yeah, that's always such a bother,
isn't it?

894
01:01:37,364 --> 01:01:39,730
After you, mother.

895
01:01:39,174 --> 01:01:41,938
<i>And now, before you die,</i>
<i>my pretty one, I shall tell you...</i>

896
01:01:41,485 --> 01:01:46,548
<i>... I am not Professor Fetlock,</i>
<i>the astronomer, I am Baggo the Bat!</i>

897
01:01:44,321 --> 01:01:47,313
<i>Mothers, do your kiddies knock</i>
<i>each other's teeth out?</i>

898
01:01:49,301 --> 01:01:53,260
Do you figure it was the mob
that blitzed Barrow? Or a solo job?

899
01:01:53,188 --> 01:01:55,452
I'm just a little bit in doubt.
What do you think?

900
01:01:55,999 --> 01:01:59,230
I'll lay you 6-2 and even
it was a dame.

901
01:01:59,002 --> 01:02:00,594
- Do you think...
- <i>Visit Dr. Fang</i>...

902
01:02:01,363 --> 01:02:02,830
...that your star boarder was...?

903
01:02:04,724 --> 01:02:08,387
I've got that commercial timed
so I never have to hear it.

904
01:02:07,202 --> 01:02:10,535
Now, you were saying
that Mr. Barrow was...

905
01:02:10,372 --> 01:02:12,966
- <i>Ravelli, have you packed the Tommy guns?</i>
- <i>Yes, chief.</i>

906
01:02:13,325 --> 01:02:15,225
- <i>Have you got the poison gas?</i>
- <i>Yes, chief.</i>

907
01:02:18,547 --> 01:02:20,708
- <i>The tickets for the train?</i>
- <i>Yes, super, chief!</i>

908
01:02:21,716 --> 01:02:24,879
<i>Then I go! Quick! My shortwave hat,</i>
<i>my invisible cape...</i>

909
01:02:25,862 --> 01:02:28,126
<i>... and my six-fingered gloves.</i>

910
01:02:28,306 --> 01:02:31,707
<i>Now we shall see</i>
<i>who is the master of</i>...

911
01:02:31,701 --> 01:02:35,262
- The battery.
- Oh, you double-crosser.

912
01:02:33,453 --> 01:02:37,856
Holy smoke. I'll miss
my <i>Barrel of Blood</i> program.

913
01:02:35,088 --> 01:02:37,716
Asta, sharpen up your nose.

914
01:02:38,925 --> 01:02:41,325
Well, we've got a little work here.

915
01:02:42,429 --> 01:02:44,522
Not much work.

916
01:02:45,215 --> 01:02:47,843
What's the matter?
Don't you like Out of This World?

917
01:02:47,267 --> 01:02:48,598
Whitey Barrow did.

918
01:02:49,602 --> 01:02:51,331
Come on.

919
01:02:52,939 --> 01:02:54,804
Well, come on.

920
01:02:55,392 --> 01:02:57,860
What are you trying to do,
give yourself a hot foot?

921
01:02:59,946 --> 01:03:02,176
Oh, frostbite, huh?

922
01:03:03,708 --> 01:03:05,232
Well.

923
01:03:11,099 --> 01:03:15,559
Asta, that's the hottest radiator in town.

924
01:03:28,592 --> 01:03:30,025
Won't you come in?

925
01:03:31,644 --> 01:03:32,906
No?

926
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:12,927
Well, then I'll come out.

927
01:04:13,612 --> 01:04:18,049
- How did you get in here?
- I was on a treasure hunt. Same as you.

928
01:04:20,919 --> 01:04:24,912
But I was the early bird.
Look what I dug up.

929
01:04:25,565 --> 01:04:28,261
- Yours?
- Yes.

930
01:04:31,346 --> 01:04:33,974
Now, how did that get in here?

931
01:04:33,990 --> 01:04:36,720
And while we're at it,
how did you get in here?

932
01:04:51,591 --> 01:04:53,525
I've been here quite a lot before.

933
01:04:57,489 --> 01:05:00,652
Did Stephens knows
about you and Barrow?

934
01:05:41,057 --> 01:05:43,582
No, I don't think so.

935
01:05:42,642 --> 01:05:44,667
What about this?

936
01:05:44,085 --> 01:05:47,248
Whitey was in trouble.
He owed $8000 in gambling debts...

937
01:05:49,207 --> 01:05:51,573
...and he was being pressed.

938
01:05:53,787 --> 01:05:57,052
- By whom?
- Some bookmaker.

939
01:05:58,266 --> 01:06:01,326
- What bookmaker?
- I don't remember.

940
01:06:01,127 --> 01:06:03,459
Was it...?

941
01:06:03,938 --> 01:06:08,432
Sorry. Was it Rainbow Benny?

942
01:06:06,858 --> 01:06:08,792
Yes, that was his name.

943
01:06:08,943 --> 01:06:12,811
I couldn't raise the money, so I gave
Whitey the bracelet to use instead.

944
01:06:12,588 --> 01:06:17,218
I took the risk of Stephens finding out.
I couldn't do anything else.

945
01:06:15,283 --> 01:06:16,841
Whitey must've had something.

946
01:06:18,812 --> 01:06:20,803
He did.

947
01:06:22,148 --> 01:06:23,843
That's how it goes.

948
01:06:24,984 --> 01:06:28,579
Mr. Charles, you can help me.

949
01:06:28,438 --> 01:06:30,133
Give me back the bracelet.

950
01:06:31,658 --> 01:06:36,322
If the police get it and Stephens finds out,
I don't know what might happen.

951
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:37,857
It won't help you to ruin me.
Now, I told you the truth.

952
01:06:38,832 --> 01:06:42,495
I loved Whitey. I didn't kill him,
and I wouldn't protect his murderer.

953
01:06:40,950 --> 01:06:43,180
I can't give it back to you now...

954
01:06:44,979 --> 01:06:48,210
...but I'll try to see that the police
don't bother you.

955
01:06:49,792 --> 01:06:51,760
Thanks.

956
01:06:55,156 --> 01:06:59,559
Asta! Don't run after her.
We did all right.

957
01:06:57,325 --> 01:06:59,793
Come on, get away. Fast.

958
01:06:59,218 --> 01:07:00,446
Good evening, Mr. Charles.

959
01:07:02,997 --> 01:07:05,488
Valentine.
Open any interesting doors lately?

960
01:07:04,858 --> 01:07:08,453
- Just autos, no banks. Evening, ma'am.
- Good evening.

961
01:07:09,696 --> 01:07:11,323
- Good evening, Mrs. Charles.
- Mario.

962
01:07:13,591 --> 01:07:16,025
Good evening, Mario.

963
01:07:17,595 --> 01:07:20,792
Well, if you strike oil,
don't forget your old pals.

964
01:07:19,989 --> 01:07:21,980
The lady would like to check
the dog, no?

965
01:07:23,376 --> 01:07:25,708
I'm afraid he'd resent it terribly.
Stop it, Asta!

966
01:07:29,999 --> 01:07:32,593
We'd like to be introduced
to the handsomest lobster...

967
01:07:46,624 --> 01:07:51,084
...in the establishment.
- This way, please. This way.

968
01:08:03,525 --> 01:08:06,551
- Hiya, Nick.
- Well, Nick. Glad to see you.

969
01:08:04,909 --> 01:08:06,877
Sure you won't put the feedbag on
with us?

970
01:08:07,579 --> 01:08:09,342
I'd like to, but I got a party there.

971
01:08:12,976 --> 01:08:15,240
- Come on, Nick.
- Come on, Nicky.

972
01:08:14,752 --> 01:08:16,185
What's going on? A celebration?

973
01:08:21,092 --> 01:08:23,356
Yeah, it's a birthday party
for Lefty Rogan's kid.

974
01:08:24,596 --> 01:08:26,723
The little tomato.
You know Lefty's missus?

975
01:08:26,764 --> 01:08:29,494
- How do you do?
- He's exactly a year old today.

976
01:08:29,267 --> 01:08:32,031
Yeah? Well, that's fine. Where's Lefty?

977
01:08:32,053 --> 01:08:35,784
- He's been in jail for five years.
- Yeah, he broke out once.

978
01:08:44,949 --> 01:08:48,043
Well, I hope you get all the breaks.
Both of you.

979
01:08:48,403 --> 01:08:50,633
- See you later, Nick.
- Come back again.

980
01:08:50,547 --> 01:08:52,174
- Boys and girls.
- Well, hi, Nick.

981
01:08:52,457 --> 01:08:56,587
Hiya, Paul. Molly.
A little Phi Beta Kappa convention.

982
01:08:54,909 --> 01:08:57,400
Well, very nice timing, Mommy.

983
01:08:56,519 --> 01:08:58,282
It was nice of you
to ask us to dinner.

984
01:08:58,938 --> 01:09:01,566
Even nicer to arrange
this coming-out party.

985
01:09:01,249 --> 01:09:05,481
Well, the main point is that thanks
to Nick, we are out and together.

986
01:09:04,135 --> 01:09:06,035
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Charles.

987
01:09:07,088 --> 01:09:08,578
Luis, we're famished.

988
01:09:12,093 --> 01:09:14,084
Well, what is it gonna
be to eat tonight?

989
01:09:15,371 --> 01:09:18,807
- Molly, what would make you happy?
- Well, could you suggest something?

990
01:09:17,765 --> 01:09:23,362
If I no work here, if I just come in
like you, I order one thing. Sea bass.

991
01:09:19,576 --> 01:09:22,306
- I think I'd like that.
- One sea bass.

992
01:09:26,274 --> 01:09:29,141
I think shad roe will be my dish, Luis.

993
01:09:28,943 --> 01:09:32,344
The sea bass, she's very good.
She's A-number-1.

994
01:09:30,887 --> 01:09:34,584
- But the chef recommends shad roe.
- The chef!

995
01:09:33,665 --> 01:09:37,260
- I'll take sea bass.
- Two sea bass.

996
01:09:38,094 --> 01:09:40,654
- How's the cracked crab?
- You are Nick's friend.

997
01:09:40,146 --> 01:09:42,910
For Nick's friend,
the good is none too best.

998
01:09:41,814 --> 01:09:43,941
Sea bass?

999
01:09:43,984 --> 01:09:45,281
Three sea bass.

1000
01:09:47,604 --> 01:09:51,506
- Broiled lobster.
- You no want sea bass?

1001
01:09:53,351 --> 01:09:57,344
- Broiled lobster.
- But they all order sea bass.

1002
01:09:56,279 --> 01:10:02,149
- They are easily led.
- The sea bass is a filet. No bones, almost.

1003
01:09:59,307 --> 01:10:02,299
- Broiled lobster.
- The meat, it is white.

1004
01:10:03,027 --> 01:10:04,961
The skin is crispy.

1005
01:10:07,532 --> 01:10:12,526
The butter is as yellow like the sunshine.
I serve it steaming hot.

1006
01:10:11,319 --> 01:10:15,915
It tastes something like you never taste
in your whole life.

1007
01:10:14,038 --> 01:10:15,630
I'm talking about...

1008
01:10:17,183 --> 01:10:20,277
- Sea bass.
- Four sea bass!

1009
01:10:19,494 --> 01:10:22,486
Asta. Asta's gone.

1010
01:10:25,692 --> 01:10:28,490
He's probably gone to the bar.
Excuse me.

1011
01:10:29,779 --> 01:10:31,906
Asta!

1012
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:38,193
Well, hello, Rainbow.
What's the matter, nervous?

1013
01:10:40,231 --> 01:10:45,396
Yeah. Yeah. That's it. Nervous.

1014
01:10:43,401 --> 01:10:46,063
The horses ain't been running right
for me.

1015
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:49,752
I see. How were they running when
Barrow lost that 8 grand to you?

1016
01:10:50,692 --> 01:10:56,289
Oh, Nick, you're too smart to get sold
on a pipe dream like that.

1017
01:10:56,581 --> 01:11:01,075
If I gave the police a drag on that pipe,
they might get dreams about you.

1018
01:10:58,366 --> 01:11:03,303
Nick, it ain't like you to turn the cops
on a guy who's clean.

1019
01:11:09,094 --> 01:11:10,857
- Here's your coffee.
- Give me my check.

1020
01:11:14,549 --> 01:11:16,949
- Yes, sir.
- Double.

1021
01:11:26,903 --> 01:11:30,134
Just like I was telling Abrams,
I was nowhere near the office...

1022
01:11:29,572 --> 01:11:34,839
...when Whitey got bumped.
- Really? The watchman says differently.

1023
01:11:33,743 --> 01:11:37,509
The watchman saw you running away
right after the shot.

1024
01:11:39,082 --> 01:11:43,109
You're kidding, Nick. You...
You don't mean that.

1025
01:11:41,918 --> 01:11:45,217
Benny, relax! Rela...

1026
01:11:47,232 --> 01:11:51,692
Well, bulletproof vest, huh?
Who makes those for you?

1027
01:11:53,262 --> 01:11:56,322
- Your check, sir.
- Okay.

1028
01:12:00,153 --> 01:12:01,984
Thank you.

1029
01:12:05,275 --> 01:12:06,936
Hey, break that up!

1030
01:12:07,218 --> 01:12:09,482
With the $2 dinner,
you get machine guns.

1031
01:12:09,779 --> 01:12:12,339
Throw them out! Throw them all out!

1032
01:12:13,166 --> 01:12:16,226
Of course, you wouldn't know
how it started, would you?

1033
01:12:19,506 --> 01:12:21,235
- No.
- Asta!

1034
01:12:23,985 --> 01:12:25,919
Asta!

1035
01:12:28,181 --> 01:12:33,209
Look, I won't say a word about this
if you'll do as much for me sometime.

1036
01:12:32,135 --> 01:12:33,602
- Asta!
- You can't find him.

1037
01:12:36,781 --> 01:12:39,716
- You'd better get back to the table.
- Or under the table.

1038
01:12:40,001 --> 01:12:43,698
No wonder we husbands stray from home.
They leave us alone all the time.

1039
01:13:10,557 --> 01:13:13,583
Say, did you ever hear of a gal
by the name of Claire Porter?

1040
01:13:21,067 --> 01:13:23,194
It was quiet
until you two went to the bar.

1041
01:13:27,690 --> 01:13:29,521
Well, you're back.

1042
01:13:36,366 --> 01:13:38,698
Say, what started that cyclone out there,
I wonder.

1043
01:13:39,586 --> 01:13:41,349
I wonder.

1044
01:13:41,537 --> 01:13:43,334
That was Rainbow Benny, wasn't it?

1045
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:53,764
- Shall I call the police?
- No, no.

1046
01:13:57,604 --> 01:14:02,064
Abrams will be here any minute. Besides,
I don't think Rainbow will go very far.

1047
01:13:59,247 --> 01:14:00,680
Why'd he run out?

1048
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:05,427
I don't know. Maybe he went home
to change his conscience.

1049
01:14:06,229 --> 01:14:09,756
- You mean, he killed Whitey?
- Well, he had a reason and the chance.

1050
01:14:09,424 --> 01:14:11,858
You know, if we only had
a little more on Rainbow...

1051
01:14:11,734 --> 01:14:13,861
...we might get him to sing
a very pretty song.

1052
01:14:13,737 --> 01:14:18,299
Maybe I can get you that little more.
Excuse me.

1053
01:14:16,239 --> 01:14:19,333
Well, what is gonna be to eat tonight?

1054
01:14:18,183 --> 01:14:19,411
No sea bass.

1055
01:14:20,126 --> 01:14:21,753
Hello. Major Sculley, please.

1056
01:14:21,853 --> 01:14:25,482
Who's speaking, please? Just a moment.
Paul Clarke.

1057
01:14:26,466 --> 01:14:30,095
Thank you. Hello, Paul.
It's great to hear from you.

1058
01:14:28,084 --> 01:14:30,917
- I wanna see you. Where are you?
- I'm at Mario's with Nick.

1059
01:14:31,304 --> 01:14:33,795
Major, Nick just had a run-in
with Rainbow Benny...

1060
01:14:35,032 --> 01:14:38,092
...but he got away. Some records
on Rainbow would help Nick.

1061
01:14:37,618 --> 01:14:41,110
Yes, Paul, of course.
Sure, I'll go through the files myself.

1062
01:14:39,929 --> 01:14:42,193
I'll see that you get them. Right.

1063
01:14:45,819 --> 01:14:47,150
There they go!

1064
01:14:51,607 --> 01:14:52,904
- Come on, Rusty!
- Go on, boy!

1065
01:14:53,109 --> 01:14:55,134
Come on, get those flippers out there!

1066
01:14:54,919 --> 01:14:56,477
- Come on.
- Come on.

1067
01:14:58,698 --> 01:14:59,926
- Come on!
- Come on.

1068
01:14:58,723 --> 01:15:01,191
- You got them!
- Come on, boy. Come on.

1069
01:15:02,502 --> 01:15:05,903
- Look at them go!
- No, no! Get over here, get over here!

1070
01:15:05,505 --> 01:15:08,406
You dope! What's the matter, you dope?
You've got all the luck.

1071
01:15:08,182 --> 01:15:09,911
What did you do, swallow a horseshoe?

1072
01:15:08,175 --> 01:15:10,973
- That's 240 martinis you owe me.
- You tell him, Mrs. Charles.

1073
01:15:11,511 --> 01:15:15,675
Don't worry, she'll tell me, all right. Hiya,
lieutenant. Pull up a turtle and sit down.

1074
01:15:15,181 --> 01:15:17,809
While you been partying,
I've been leveling on this case.

1075
01:15:17,633 --> 01:15:21,660
You missed the excitement. Rainbow Benny
ran out just as the cyclone came in.

1076
01:15:19,135 --> 01:15:21,296
- What?
- You know the fella that the watchman...

1077
01:15:20,612 --> 01:15:23,012
...saw running from Stephens' office?
Rainbow Benny.

1078
01:15:22,805 --> 01:15:25,069
- He told you that?
- No, but when I suggested it...

1079
01:15:24,524 --> 01:15:26,321
...he scooted out like a scared lizard.

1080
01:15:25,950 --> 01:15:29,283
- Nick. Nick, do you mind? I wanna...
- No.

1081
01:15:28,870 --> 01:15:31,668
Paul, come and play with the boys.

1082
01:15:28,862 --> 01:15:32,025
Here's your cigarette case.
Minus Miss Porter's fingerprints.

1083
01:15:33,316 --> 01:15:35,910
- Did they make interesting reading?
- And how.

1084
01:15:36,377 --> 01:15:38,538
That swanky dame of Stephens'
is a career girl.

1085
01:15:38,296 --> 01:15:41,959
Her right name is Clara Peters.
Served three months for shoplifting...

1086
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:43,902
...served one year for playing
in a badger-game setup.

1087
01:15:45,603 --> 01:15:47,798
- Here's the record on her.
- Good work.

1088
01:15:48,381 --> 01:15:51,077
- And who do you think was mixed up?
- Whitey Barrow.

1089
01:15:52,585 --> 01:15:54,553
Do you mean Whitey
was blackmailing Claire?

1090
01:15:52,610 --> 01:15:56,239
Sure, sure. That's what he means.
Nick, it's an open-and-closed case.

1091
01:15:54,946 --> 01:15:58,040
Whitey was making the Porter dame
pay off.

1092
01:15:57,507 --> 01:16:00,908
So she shut him up for good.
I pick her up, she confesses.

1093
01:15:59,951 --> 01:16:01,942
No, no, but wait a minute, lieutenant.

1094
01:16:01,895 --> 01:16:04,762
True enough, you've established
a great motive for the lady...

1095
01:16:05,398 --> 01:16:08,265
...but we've got one equally good
against Stephens, Macy...

1096
01:16:10,904 --> 01:16:13,429
...Rainbow Benny and...

1097
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:15,730
Oh, here comes Major Sculley.

1098
01:16:17,026 --> 01:16:19,494
I think he'll have some dope
on Rainbow.

1099
01:16:19,362 --> 01:16:22,763
Plenty of it. Paul, I'm delighted
to see you. I can't tell you how bad...

1100
01:16:23,199 --> 01:16:25,258
We've got work to do.
Hold the reunion later.

1101
01:16:26,036 --> 01:16:28,334
Yes, of course, lieutenant.
Well, here it is.

1102
01:16:28,396 --> 01:16:30,796
We checked the bets
indicated on that laundry list...

1103
01:16:31,257 --> 01:16:33,157
...and Rainbow Benny
was behind every one.

1104
01:16:33,401 --> 01:16:34,993
- That's enough.
- My car's outside.

1105
01:16:37,213 --> 01:16:38,703
Benny doesn't live far away.

1106
01:16:40,492 --> 01:16:43,086
- I think Paul's entitled to be in on this.
- Sure.

1107
01:16:44,053 --> 01:16:47,318
Hey, what about me? I mean, us?

1108
01:16:46,222 --> 01:16:50,682
This is a stag. Look, Mommy,
you drink up some of your winnings.

1109
01:16:49,250 --> 01:16:53,710
Barkeeper, bring Mrs. Charles
240 martinis. We won't be long.

1110
01:16:52,278 --> 01:16:54,838
I've heard that before. Come on, Molly.

1111
01:16:55,006 --> 01:16:58,169
- Follow that car, quick.
- Yes, ma'am.

1112
01:16:56,674 --> 01:16:58,869
This way, lieutenant. I know where it is.

1113
01:16:59,285 --> 01:17:02,914
I've been to see Rainbow before.
He lives upstairs.

1114
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:05,110
Just to the right here, gentlemen.

1115
01:17:05,099 --> 01:17:07,124
- Nick, maybe he skipped.
- Let's hope not.

1116
01:17:07,577 --> 01:17:10,045
Let me take a look at that.

1117
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:13,725
No key in the lock. It's a cinch.

1118
01:17:12,223 --> 01:17:15,818
Paul. Come here, Paul, will you?
Give me a lift.

1119
01:17:13,967 --> 01:17:17,926
That's it, grab hold of him. Lieutenant,
see if you can cut him down, will you?

1120
01:17:15,635 --> 01:17:17,626
Got it.

1121
01:17:18,638 --> 01:17:21,607
That's it. Now let's get him over
on the bed. Here we go.

1122
01:17:22,425 --> 01:17:24,586
Just drop him on the bed.

1123
01:17:27,072 --> 01:17:28,300
This is the worst yet.

1124
01:17:32,268 --> 01:17:33,826
- It's awful.
- Phone the coroner.

1125
01:17:41,161 --> 01:17:44,961
- Yes, sir.
- Rigor mortis already setting in.

1126
01:18:02,457 --> 01:18:05,483
I guess he knew we had him concerned
and decided to do it himself.

1127
01:18:04,817 --> 01:18:07,183
Look here, Nick. Is this anything?

1128
01:18:09,297 --> 01:18:11,527
- What's this?
- That's the book!

1129
01:18:16,804 --> 01:18:19,329
The book Whitey took away
from me in Stephens' office.

1130
01:18:18,999 --> 01:18:21,900
What? Nick! Nick, this is the evidence.

1131
01:18:23,670 --> 01:18:26,901
Rainbow might as well have signed
a confession before he hung himself.

1132
01:18:39,769 --> 01:18:41,828
- Major, we've got it.
- I hope so.

1133
01:18:43,523 --> 01:18:47,391
Lieutenant, I'm afraid the suicide theory
doesn't quite stand up.

1134
01:18:48,002 --> 01:18:50,493
But, Nick, there's no sign
of anything but a suicide.

1135
01:18:51,364 --> 01:18:55,095
Look, he got up on that,
hung himself on the chandelier...

1136
01:18:54,843 --> 01:18:56,902
...jumped and kicked the chair over.

1137
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:02,116
Then he used his own bathrobe sash
as a rope.

1138
01:19:02,183 --> 01:19:05,380
I think that's all window dressing.
Look here.

1139
01:19:03,901 --> 01:19:05,391
Look at the sash.

1140
01:19:09,165 --> 01:19:11,395
Silken, smooth. Now look at his throat.

1141
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:14,521
Well, he was hung.
There's bound to be marks.

1142
01:19:16,030 --> 01:19:18,863
Yes, but not raw lacerations like that.

1143
01:19:18,416 --> 01:19:22,409
I think he was strangled first,
with a rough, heavy cord. A rope.

1144
01:19:21,144 --> 01:19:23,738
And then the stage was set
with this overturned chair...

1145
01:19:24,205 --> 01:19:27,197
...and the chandelier and the sash.
And another thing.

1146
01:19:27,592 --> 01:19:29,753
When Benny skipped out
of Mario's tonight...

1147
01:19:29,853 --> 01:19:32,913
...he was wearing a bulletproof vest.
- What?

1148
01:19:33,881 --> 01:19:36,873
- It's not on him now.
- Maybe he took it off.

1149
01:19:36,551 --> 01:19:39,486
- Or it was taken off.
- By who?

1150
01:19:40,438 --> 01:19:42,702
By whoever hung him there.

1151
01:19:42,699 --> 01:19:44,860
A murderer didn't want us
to know that Benny...

1152
01:19:46,277 --> 01:19:48,211
...had been living in fear of his life.

1153
01:19:49,897 --> 01:19:52,559
Nick, who could that have been?

1154
01:19:51,566 --> 01:19:53,500
I don't know yet.

1155
01:19:53,951 --> 01:19:56,852
Lieutenant, I think perhaps we'd
better have a little powwow...

1156
01:19:56,287 --> 01:19:57,982
...in your office tomorrow.

1157
01:19:59,290 --> 01:20:00,518
Keep your hands off!

1158
01:20:03,461 --> 01:20:05,622
- Here we are.
- Hold it a minute, will you, Macy?

1159
01:20:06,247 --> 01:20:08,340
Snap Dick Tracy.
He'd look good in the comics.

1160
01:20:09,417 --> 01:20:12,716
You and Nick Charles can't push me
around. Dragging me here is illegal!

1161
01:20:11,753 --> 01:20:13,744
So is killing people illegal in this state.

1162
01:20:14,972 --> 01:20:17,497
- Are you accusing me of...?
- Yeah! Of spoiling my lunch!

1163
01:20:18,143 --> 01:20:21,271
- I wanna call my lawyer.
- That'll be a nickel.

1164
01:20:21,262 --> 01:20:23,560
Hello, lieutenant. Here's laughing boy.

1165
01:20:23,707 --> 01:20:27,609
Sit there, Macy. Thanks, boys.
Wait outside.

1166
01:20:26,042 --> 01:20:29,034
Hello? Fenster? This is Stephens.

1167
01:20:28,128 --> 01:20:31,222
Come down to Abrams' office
at police headquarters right away.

1168
01:20:31,247 --> 01:20:34,307
I don't care how busy you are.
Right away.

1169
01:20:33,583 --> 01:20:34,811
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

1170
01:20:36,636 --> 01:20:38,365
Just sit there.

1171
01:20:44,836 --> 01:20:47,396
What do you want Clarke here for?
He don't know nothing.

1172
01:20:48,314 --> 01:20:50,646
He was just standing over Barrow's body
with a gun.

1173
01:20:50,650 --> 01:20:53,141
If I was you, Macy,
I wouldn't talk too much.

1174
01:20:53,795 --> 01:20:57,822
Is it all right if I tell Mr. Stephens
that company is coming?

1175
01:20:57,273 --> 01:21:01,437
- What's the idea of bringing Porter here?
- I want her here. Is that all right with you?

1176
01:20:59,442 --> 01:21:01,967
- Where will you be, Baku?
- I'll be here.

1177
01:21:02,136 --> 01:21:03,364
No, please.

1178
01:21:05,832 --> 01:21:08,164
Honey, I'm sorry
you're being dragged into this.

1179
01:21:08,309 --> 01:21:12,370
It's quite all right, Link.
I want to be here if you need me.

1180
01:21:12,697 --> 01:21:14,892
Fred, let Miss Porter sit here.

1181
01:21:15,867 --> 01:21:17,767
Let her sit there.

1182
01:21:19,153 --> 01:21:20,950
Thank you.

1183
01:21:25,018 --> 01:21:29,455
Hello, Maguire. Glad to see you.
Just sit over there, will you?

1184
01:21:26,436 --> 01:21:28,734
We flew Maguire in just for you, Fred.

1185
01:21:30,715 --> 01:21:33,741
Now, Mommy, if any trouble starts,
you dive right under the table.

1186
01:21:33,476 --> 01:21:36,741
- Major Sculley and I will join you there.
- What kind of trouble, Nick?

1187
01:21:35,979 --> 01:21:39,244
Frankly, I don't know. But I'm going
to do my level best to stir it up.

1188
01:21:38,648 --> 01:21:41,014
Well, I'm counting on you, Nick.
Good luck.

1189
01:21:50,402 --> 01:21:52,063
Thank you.

1190
01:21:57,217 --> 01:21:59,208
Hello, Mrs. Charles. Hiya, Nick. Major.

1191
01:22:00,803 --> 01:22:04,398
Lieutenant, Molly, Paul, Miss Porter.

1192
01:22:02,196 --> 01:22:04,323
Well, the condemned man ate
a hearty breakfast.

1193
01:22:04,699 --> 01:22:08,032
This is yesterday's breakfast.
On this job, I don't get a chance to eat.

1194
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:11,753
- Sit down, Mrs. Charles.
- Thank you. Go get them, Nicky.

1195
01:22:11,314 --> 01:22:14,078
Asta, you keep Mommy quiet.

1196
01:22:15,018 --> 01:22:19,250
- I invited you all here to meet a murderer.
- Good afternoon, Macy.

1197
01:22:17,270 --> 01:22:20,262
Have your fun, Charles, but make it
quick. I ain't got much time.

1198
01:22:17,262 --> 01:22:21,756
Then maybe the state will give you some.
Now, nobody speak until he's spoken to.

1199
01:22:22,717 --> 01:22:25,151
Quiet, Asta. You're in contempt of court.

1200
01:22:26,529 --> 01:22:27,757
Now then, Mr. Stephens.

1201
01:22:29,724 --> 01:22:32,124
I've told you everything I know
about this.

1202
01:22:33,169 --> 01:22:35,194
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

1203
01:22:36,589 --> 01:22:38,887
The morgue is the floor below,
isn't it?

1204
01:22:39,117 --> 01:22:40,744
He's my lawyer.

1205
01:22:40,952 --> 01:22:44,149
Mr. Fenster, you're just in time
to hear your client tell...

1206
01:22:43,121 --> 01:22:45,146
...why he visited Rainbow Benny
last night.

1207
01:22:47,434 --> 01:22:50,403
If you wanna deny it, I can get
the cab driver who took you.

1208
01:22:49,744 --> 01:22:52,406
What of it? That was four hours
before Rainbow was killed.

1209
01:22:53,247 --> 01:22:56,614
If I was going to murder him, do you
think I'd want a cab driver to know?

1210
01:22:56,250 --> 01:22:58,150
No, l...! No, I don't.

1211
01:22:59,862 --> 01:23:02,956
Pardon me, lieutenant,
but speaking of drivers...

1212
01:23:04,258 --> 01:23:06,590
...is Miss Porter's chauffeur here?

1213
01:23:07,428 --> 01:23:11,091
Why, yes. He's downstairs in the car.

1214
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:18,016
- Why?
- I thought he might enjoy the view up here.

1215
01:23:18,748 --> 01:23:20,807
On a clear day, you can see the jail.

1216
01:23:20,133 --> 01:23:22,363
- Larsen, get Miss Porter's chauffeur.
- Yes, sir.

1217
01:23:23,995 --> 01:23:28,159
Now I want a word from Maguire.
One word.

1218
01:23:26,222 --> 01:23:29,521
Was Macy in the ticket office with you
when Whitey Barrow was killed?

1219
01:23:28,842 --> 01:23:31,936
- No.
- You double-crossing sneak!

1220
01:23:30,643 --> 01:23:33,407
I thought it was Macy all along.

1221
01:23:34,005 --> 01:23:36,838
Why did you want an alibi so bad, Fred?

1222
01:23:36,232 --> 01:23:38,996
Because I didn't want any
thick-headed cops setting me up...

1223
01:23:39,344 --> 01:23:42,905
...for suspect number one.
- Don't you call Nick a thick-headed cop!

1224
01:23:42,179 --> 01:23:43,976
Oh, yeah?

1225
01:23:45,742 --> 01:23:48,540
And I didn't mean him.

1226
01:23:48,519 --> 01:23:50,282
Oh, yeah?

1227
01:23:51,806 --> 01:23:55,264
I suppose you wanted an alibi
for the same reason, Mr. Stephens?

1228
01:23:54,308 --> 01:23:56,003
We'd like to weigh that question.

1229
01:23:58,146 --> 01:24:02,879
I didn't need any alibi. I was out
of the arena before Whitey was killed.

1230
01:24:01,007 --> 01:24:02,975
You...?

1231
01:24:03,259 --> 01:24:07,628
You drove Mr. Stephens and Miss Porter
home from the arena night before last?

1232
01:24:05,653 --> 01:24:08,520
- Does he have to answer that?
- I'm just thinking that over.

1233
01:24:09,991 --> 01:24:11,822
Did you drive them home, or didn't you?

1234
01:24:13,469 --> 01:24:19,135
Yes, I drive them home.
Leave arena 9:45.

1235
01:24:22,220 --> 01:24:24,051
How come you remember the exact time?

1236
01:24:25,339 --> 01:24:28,502
What do you do when you get
into that car? Punch a clock?

1237
01:24:28,342 --> 01:24:31,470
- You'll verify that, no doubt?
- Yes.

1238
01:24:31,287 --> 01:24:35,656
Mr. Stephens, was it your idea
that Barrow and Miss Porter...

1239
01:24:35,625 --> 01:24:37,559
...were merely casual acquaintances?

1240
01:24:37,569 --> 01:24:39,696
Link, be careful.
He's trying to trap you.

1241
01:24:40,713 --> 01:24:42,806
Sit down.

1242
01:24:42,665 --> 01:24:46,431
Mommy, let me see that present
I gave you last night.

1243
01:24:47,670 --> 01:24:51,299
- I wanna give this to another girl.
- Nicky!

1244
01:24:49,531 --> 01:24:52,398
I found this hidden
in Barrow's apartment.

1245
01:25:00,258 --> 01:25:05,059
While I was there, Miss Porter came in.
She'd been there before.

1246
01:25:02,427 --> 01:25:04,895
That's a lie! Whitey stole it from me.

1247
01:25:08,408 --> 01:25:10,467
What are you getting at, mister?

1248
01:25:11,436 --> 01:25:15,497
Maybe you and your partner, Macy, were
relieved when Barrow was found dead.

1249
01:25:13,438 --> 01:25:16,601
But to Miss Porter,
it was really glad tidings.

1250
01:25:19,727 --> 01:25:24,562
Whitey had been blackmailing her.
He knew who she was, all about her.

1251
01:25:21,729 --> 01:25:23,924
At first she charmed him into silence.

1252
01:25:25,066 --> 01:25:28,934
Then she had to use money
and, finally, her jewelry.

1253
01:25:29,262 --> 01:25:31,355
Why, you cheap phoney.

1254
01:25:33,791 --> 01:25:38,125
And I was using you for an alibi. That's
a laugh. You needed it a lot more than...

1255
01:25:35,910 --> 01:25:39,641
So neither of you had an alibi.
I'd think that over if I were you.

1256
01:25:38,221 --> 01:25:39,950
I didn't have anything to do with it.

1257
01:25:41,390 --> 01:25:44,689
I was afraid the police would find
the bracelet and trace it to me...

1258
01:25:45,303 --> 01:25:47,601
...then they'd be sure I killed him.
But I didn't!

1259
01:25:49,115 --> 01:25:51,345
I didn't know Whitey was dead
until he told me.

1260
01:25:52,143 --> 01:25:53,474
You murderous tramp!

1261
01:25:57,123 --> 01:25:59,557
He told me Whitey was dead
before he took me home.

1262
01:25:59,767 --> 01:26:01,394
That's a lie!

1263
01:26:01,986 --> 01:26:04,181
Hey! Hey, that's enough of this!

1264
01:26:06,249 --> 01:26:09,047
- She can't do that to you!
- Oh, that's fine!

1265
01:26:09,586 --> 01:26:12,020
Any more of this, and you'll both land
in the cooler.

1266
01:26:14,591 --> 01:26:17,992
- Maguire.
- Yes, sir?

1267
01:26:16,951 --> 01:26:19,044
Where did the police pick you
up this morning?

1268
01:26:24,959 --> 01:26:27,154
- Treeport.
- That's right. I picked him up.

1269
01:26:27,236 --> 01:26:30,137
Treeport, huh? That's only a couple
of hundred miles from here.

1270
01:26:31,741 --> 01:26:34,209
If you left town last night
before Benny was killed...

1271
01:26:35,637 --> 01:26:37,662
...how does it come you weren't
further away?

1272
01:26:37,522 --> 01:26:40,582
My car broke down.
Honest, Mr. Charles, I ain't in this.

1273
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:45,198
That's the truth, so help me.
I lied once, for Macy, but I ain't lying now.

1274
01:26:43,478 --> 01:26:45,036
Barrow had nothing on me.

1275
01:26:45,863 --> 01:26:49,424
Supposing Barrow did have something
on us. I've been in plenty of scandals.

1276
01:26:47,365 --> 01:26:49,390
That didn't mean enough
for me to kill him.

1277
01:26:49,984 --> 01:26:53,920
Why, you yellow welsher! Are you
hinting that maybe I killed Barrow?

1278
01:26:51,794 --> 01:26:53,853
Save this fight for the arena, boys.

1279
01:26:54,155 --> 01:26:57,818
But if I was milking a rich guy and
Barrow was making me sweat for it...

1280
01:26:57,133 --> 01:26:59,931
...maybe then I'd...
- Sure, I looked for Barrow that night...

1281
01:27:00,687 --> 01:27:03,417
...to get my bracelet back.
But I swear I didn't find him.

1282
01:27:04,249 --> 01:27:07,082
Even if I did, even if I killed him,
would I take that book?

1283
01:27:04,274 --> 01:27:08,210
- It didn't mean anything to me.
- It might have, as a hold on Stephens.

1284
01:27:06,526 --> 01:27:08,050
Blackmail, I think it's called.

1285
01:27:08,887 --> 01:27:11,583
Yeah? And I suppose I could strangle
Benny and hang him up.

1286
01:27:11,981 --> 01:27:14,916
- No, but your chauffeur could.
- Baku, he's trying to frame us!

1287
01:27:14,617 --> 01:27:18,280
Hold it, son.
Let the big boys play with your knife.

1288
01:27:16,820 --> 01:27:19,880
Maybe they'll give you
a nice little pair of cuffs.

1289
01:27:20,039 --> 01:27:21,700
Well, now, where were we?

1290
01:27:24,402 --> 01:27:26,962
Benny was hanging from the ceiling.

1291
01:27:26,162 --> 01:27:28,255
Oh, yes. Yes.

1292
01:27:29,883 --> 01:27:33,546
Because Benny had seen
who killed Barrow.

1293
01:27:32,076 --> 01:27:36,877
Macy, you said you were not disturbed
about Barrow's quitting.

1294
01:27:36,197 --> 01:27:38,358
Why did you threaten him?

1295
01:27:38,416 --> 01:27:40,281
- You did hear that, Molly?
- Yes, I did.

1296
01:27:42,253 --> 01:27:45,984
She should talk. I caught Barrow pawing
her that night right in my office.

1297
01:27:45,231 --> 01:27:48,029
- And she was sore.
- Is that the truth?

1298
01:27:48,150 --> 01:27:51,176
Well, yes. Barrow always said things.

1299
01:27:51,154 --> 01:27:53,850
He was angry because I wouldn't
pay any attention to him.

1300
01:27:55,242 --> 01:27:57,301
Isn't she sweet?

1301
01:27:56,935 --> 01:27:59,665
Did Paul know that Barrow
was annoying you?

1302
01:27:59,829 --> 01:28:03,697
No, I didn't tell him. I was afraid
he might do something rash.

1303
01:28:02,916 --> 01:28:05,111
Is this all news to you, Paul?

1304
01:28:06,753 --> 01:28:10,245
But Molly did tell you that Whitey had
had a falling out with his bosses?

1305
01:28:10,006 --> 01:28:12,270
Well, why didn't you try talking to him?

1306
01:28:11,841 --> 01:28:14,833
Nick, I didn't think it'd do any good.
Whitey and I were enemies.

1307
01:28:14,569 --> 01:28:16,901
I told Major Sculley,
hoping he could do something.

1308
01:28:16,846 --> 01:28:19,679
But Whitey was killed
before anybody could get to him.

1309
01:28:20,683 --> 01:28:22,412
Except the murderer.

1310
01:28:25,630 --> 01:28:30,499
Mr. Stephens, Benny was
your betting commissioner, wasn't he?

1311
01:28:28,190 --> 01:28:30,090
Yes, Nick, he was,
and we can prove that.

1312
01:28:30,226 --> 01:28:33,957
And representing Stephens, he did do
some bribing of jockeys, didn't he?

1313
01:28:34,113 --> 01:28:37,310
If you're trying to hang the jockey's
murder on me, save your breath.

1314
01:28:37,091 --> 01:28:40,583
You and the flatfoot claim whoever
killed the jockey killed Barrow.

1315
01:28:40,286 --> 01:28:43,346
All right. You can rule me out
of that too.

1316
01:28:43,147 --> 01:28:45,741
I didn't go near the track that day,
and I can prove it.

1317
01:28:45,408 --> 01:28:49,071
And I haven't killed a jockey
in weeks, really.

1318
01:28:48,295 --> 01:28:51,059
- When did you see Rainbow last?
- He saw him last night.

1319
01:28:52,323 --> 01:28:54,587
I went to his apartment,
but I didn't see him.

1320
01:28:54,717 --> 01:28:57,049
- Wasn't he home?
- I don't think so.

1321
01:28:58,388 --> 01:29:02,518
I rang his bell a long time, then I saw
somebody coming up the stairs...

1322
01:29:00,807 --> 01:29:02,672
...and I beat it.

1323
01:29:03,976 --> 01:29:05,307
Who was coming up the stairs?

1324
01:29:06,479 --> 01:29:09,471
Some kid delivering papers.
I didn't wanna be seen there...

1325
01:29:09,482 --> 01:29:14,476
...so I ducked away from the door.
When the kid went up, I left.

1326
01:29:11,376 --> 01:29:14,573
Lieutenant, that apartment house
where Benny lived...

1327
01:29:11,401 --> 01:29:12,629
- The Embassy Arms.
- Yes.

1328
01:29:16,439 --> 01:29:18,669
Would you mind getting the janitor
on the phone?

1329
01:29:19,108 --> 01:29:22,635
Get me... Get me the janitor
of the Embassy Arms apartments.

1330
01:29:22,996 --> 01:29:24,964
There's one thing about a murder case.

1331
01:29:26,357 --> 01:29:29,190
If you just let people talk long enough...

1332
01:29:30,028 --> 01:29:33,191
...sooner or later,
somebody will spill the beans.

1333
01:29:33,289 --> 01:29:35,655
Well, somebody has.

1334
01:29:36,034 --> 01:29:39,128
Mr. Fenster, where were you last night
at 10:00?

1335
01:29:40,822 --> 01:29:44,223
Why, l... I was at home.

1336
01:29:43,766 --> 01:29:46,098
No, I mean, I was out. In bed.

1337
01:29:46,186 --> 01:29:49,349
No, I was home, but I was in bed.

1338
01:29:48,688 --> 01:29:50,849
Are you sure you were in bed?

1339
01:29:53,001 --> 01:29:55,231
I'd like to sleep on this.

1340
01:29:55,445 --> 01:29:58,141
Hold it. This is the police department.

1341
01:29:56,946 --> 01:30:00,404
Oh, come on. The janitor, Nick.

1342
01:30:00,116 --> 01:30:02,141
Yes, please. This is the superintend.

1343
01:30:07,874 --> 01:30:12,243
I wanna know something
about apartment 25C.

1344
01:30:11,235 --> 01:30:15,638
What I wanna know is, how long did
Rainbow Benny live in that apartment?

1345
01:30:12,662 --> 01:30:16,792
Not long. He's move in last night at 7.

1346
01:30:16,716 --> 01:30:20,675
And he's dead at 10. The throat.

1347
01:30:20,412 --> 01:30:22,710
I'm sorry, you gotta speak
more noisy, please.

1348
01:30:22,555 --> 01:30:24,853
I said, where did he live before that?

1349
01:30:25,558 --> 01:30:28,994
He live in apartment 32A.

1350
01:30:29,228 --> 01:30:31,025
That's right, at the top of the stairs.

1351
01:30:40,323 --> 01:30:44,157
Well, gentlemen and ladies...

1352
01:30:43,576 --> 01:30:45,771
...we have our murderer.

1353
01:30:47,163 --> 01:30:49,757
Nicky, I can't stand it! Was it me?

1354
01:30:49,666 --> 01:30:52,328
Yeah, Nick, is it her?

1355
01:30:53,003 --> 01:30:54,231
Nick, who is it?

1356
01:30:55,338 --> 01:30:57,101
You, major.

1357
01:30:57,732 --> 01:31:00,428
Nick, you're joking.

1358
01:31:00,593 --> 01:31:04,723
No wonder the Stephens-Macy syndicate
was riding high...

1359
01:31:05,515 --> 01:31:09,076
...with a special deputy
for the state Legislature as a silent partner.

1360
01:31:08,793 --> 01:31:12,160
You were in a beautiful position
to cover up the syndicate's racket.

1361
01:31:15,108 --> 01:31:16,837
Nick, what are you saying?

1362
01:31:19,696 --> 01:31:24,292
Then you found your golden harvest
was in danger.

1363
01:31:23,975 --> 01:31:28,071
Whitey Barrow was scared.
Threatened to talk.

1364
01:31:28,763 --> 01:31:32,324
That would have meant exposure
for you. Ruin.

1365
01:31:31,241 --> 01:31:35,337
So to protect yourself
and your fellow thieves...

1366
01:31:33,710 --> 01:31:35,871
...you caught up with him
and killed him...

1367
01:31:37,797 --> 01:31:40,391
...leaving your friend Paul Clarke
to take the rap.

1368
01:31:45,972 --> 01:31:49,339
You can't mean this, Nick.
It's nonsense, every word of it.

1369
01:31:50,726 --> 01:31:53,718
You were clicking beautifully
until we released Paul...

1370
01:32:03,798 --> 01:32:07,165
...and used the accidental death
of the jockey for bait.

1371
01:32:06,684 --> 01:32:08,413
Accidental death?

1372
01:32:09,687 --> 01:32:12,417
Yes. Goldez wasn't murdered.

1373
01:32:12,748 --> 01:32:14,807
He shot himself by accident.

1374
01:32:14,667 --> 01:32:16,760
But we let it stand as a murder.

1375
01:32:19,030 --> 01:32:22,557
And we spread the news
that whoever had killed Barrow...

1376
01:32:23,343 --> 01:32:24,970
...had also killed the jockey.

1377
01:32:27,321 --> 01:32:30,313
We said we were looking
for one murderer.

1378
01:32:30,850 --> 01:32:35,116
Then, major, you did just what
Lieutenant Abrams said you would do.

1379
01:32:33,161 --> 01:32:35,186
Yeah. What was that?

1380
01:32:37,941 --> 01:32:41,240
You tried to frame someone else
to fit that picture.

1381
01:32:42,195 --> 01:32:45,164
So you picked
on poor little Rainbow Benny...

1382
01:32:45,949 --> 01:32:48,850
...because he'd been mixed up
with jockeys and crooked races...

1383
01:32:50,203 --> 01:32:52,899
...and to the police, he might seem
like the double killer.

1384
01:32:52,538 --> 01:32:57,601
You strangled him. And in his fireplace,
you planted Stephens' ledger...

1385
01:32:56,017 --> 01:32:59,043
...which contained the records
of the syndicate's crooked deals...

1386
01:33:00,547 --> 01:33:01,775
...included your rake-off.

1387
01:33:03,716 --> 01:33:07,812
Of course, you carefully burned the ledger
so that only the cover remained.

1388
01:33:07,245 --> 01:33:09,440
You removed Benny's bulletproof vest...

1389
01:33:09,172 --> 01:33:12,664
...so the police would never know that
he'd been living in fear of his life.

1390
01:33:12,058 --> 01:33:14,856
And then you strung him up to make it
look like a suicide...

1391
01:33:14,310 --> 01:33:17,143
...which would have closed this case.
- Nick, you must be mad.

1392
01:33:16,562 --> 01:33:18,587
You can't prove a word of this.

1393
01:33:20,258 --> 01:33:24,319
Major, you said last night
that you'd visited Benny before.

1394
01:33:22,068 --> 01:33:23,660
Why, yes, I did.

1395
01:33:25,379 --> 01:33:29,042
- When was the last time you visited him?
- Why, a week ago.

1396
01:33:30,101 --> 01:33:33,434
A week ago. Then that's how it was
that last night you could lead us...

1397
01:33:33,696 --> 01:33:37,188
...directly to his apartment?
- Why, yes, I remember the way.

1398
01:33:37,167 --> 01:33:39,499
But that wasn't the way a week ago.

1399
01:33:40,278 --> 01:33:43,111
That was the way
only after 7:00 last night.

1400
01:33:43,372 --> 01:33:45,272
I don't know what you're talking about.

1401
01:33:46,234 --> 01:33:51,331
Rainbow Benny moved
from apartment 32A to apartment 25C...

1402
01:33:51,456 --> 01:33:54,425
...at 7:00 yesterday evening.
The janitor just said so.

1403
01:33:54,684 --> 01:33:57,517
If you hadn't visited Benny for a week,
how did you know...

1404
01:33:56,077 --> 01:33:59,103
...that he was in 25C
when you led us there last night?

1405
01:34:00,915 --> 01:34:04,009
Your partner, Mr. Stephens,
settled this case...

1406
01:34:03,276 --> 01:34:06,677
...when he said he stood outside
Benny's apartment and saw the stairs.

1407
01:34:06,946 --> 01:34:10,473
Well, you cannot see the stairs
from apartment 25C.

1408
01:34:09,924 --> 01:34:14,418
You made only one misstep, major,
but you left a big, bloody footprint.

1409
01:34:12,927 --> 01:34:15,191
Well, lieutenant, I should say...

1410
01:34:15,121 --> 01:34:17,749
- Stop this shooting, or I'll drop Charles!
- No, major!

1411
01:34:19,375 --> 01:34:20,808
Nick! Nick, look out!

1412
01:34:21,127 --> 01:34:23,220
So that's what became
of the bulletproof vest.

1413
01:34:24,965 --> 01:34:27,092
That, Mr. Charles,
will be your last deduction.

1414
01:34:28,468 --> 01:34:30,800
Yes, I almost closed the case
with Rainbow Benny...

1415
01:34:32,138 --> 01:34:35,266
...but now I'll close it with you.
Paul, you've got your scoop...

1416
01:34:34,641 --> 01:34:37,576
...but you won't be able to write it.
I've got two more bullets.

1417
01:34:37,644 --> 01:34:40,772
One for each of you. We'll dissolve
our partnership right now.

1418
01:34:40,146 --> 01:34:42,341
You're the smartest, Mr. Charles,
so you're first.

1419
01:34:45,435 --> 01:34:48,268
- Run, Nicky, run!
- Grab him, men!

1420
01:34:48,963 --> 01:34:50,828
Let go of me!

1421
01:34:51,966 --> 01:34:55,265
- Run, Nicky! Run!
- Grab him!

1422
01:34:55,161 --> 01:34:56,788
Get off me!

1423
01:34:58,448 --> 01:35:00,040
- Run, Nicky!
- Get out of the way!

1424
01:35:02,002 --> 01:35:03,993
Run!

1425
01:35:05,697 --> 01:35:08,825
Run, Nicky, run!

1426
01:35:11,986 --> 01:35:14,682
- Are you all right?
- Oh, Nora, you were wonderful.

1427
01:35:16,374 --> 01:35:19,707
She certainly was.
Mommy, you're a heroine.

1428
01:35:19,185 --> 01:35:22,518
- What happened? What did I do?
- Do? Why, you saved all our lives.

1429
01:35:20,803 --> 01:35:22,828
You jumped right
into the muzzle of the gun.

1430
01:35:23,048 --> 01:35:24,845
I did?

1431
01:35:25,358 --> 01:35:28,555
Nick, this gun isn't loaded.
When did you empty it?

1432
01:35:27,861 --> 01:35:31,797
Oh, about three years ago.
When Nicky was cutting his teeth on it.

1433
01:35:31,172 --> 01:35:32,571
Well, then I'm not a heroine.

1434
01:35:34,284 --> 01:35:37,219
Oh, yes, you are, Mommy.
You're the bravest gal in the world.

1435
01:35:37,704 --> 01:35:40,298
Wait a minute. Almost forgot something.

1436
01:35:40,065 --> 01:35:41,794
For valor.

1437
01:35:43,076 --> 01:35:45,237
Oh, Nicky.

1438
01:35:46,329 --> 01:35:48,593
Is this one for keeps?

1439
01:35:50,633 --> 01:35:52,601
So is this one.

1440
01:35:54,637 --> 01:35:56,628
[ENGLISH]
