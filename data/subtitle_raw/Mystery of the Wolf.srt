12
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,880
Let me take it.
-Sit down now!

13
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,360
Help!

14
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,160
Paulus! Paulus!

15
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,760
Watch.

16
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,359
Watch.

17
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,360
Please Salla.

18
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,960
Please Salla, wait here.

19
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,080
Mom should get dad.
Take this.

20
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,560
Paulus.

21
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,600
Please Salla.

22
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,319
Did you see the wolf?
It ran over there.

23
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,320
Would a wolf ever come in here?

24
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,360
Whatever it was,
it shouldn't be here.

25
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,600
Where are Paulus and Laila?
The girl is all alone.

26
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,440
Laila!

27
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,040
Come on, Laila.

28
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,960
Laila. Laila.

29
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,160
Mom. Mom.

30
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,959
Something is wrong.
Take the girl.

31
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,960
I'll take Laila to the health center
and alert Törmänen.

32
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,160
Laila, come on.

33
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,800
11 years later

34
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,360
Thieves.

35
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,880
Has there been
a fence here?  -Yes.

36
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,960
You, are you not ...

37
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,280
My name is Salla and tend to go
past here on the way home.

38
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,480
My house is over there,
but not visible.

39
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,640
I've also lived here.

40
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,440
Salla, would you come in?

41
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,999
Can I offer you juice?

42
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Maybe not, mom is waiting.

43
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,360
Some other time. Bye.

44
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,439
I could have helped
if you had waited.

45
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,440
Go have some soup,
you must be hungry.

46
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,200
I saw a wolf on the mountain, or two.

47
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,720
One had taken a grouse from my snare.
- There are no wolves around here.

48
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:30,740
There is enough space for huskies or something.
- Stop it, I can recognize a wolf.

49
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,960
Salla.
-Nobody ever believes me.

50
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,720
I'm not good at this. Poor you,
you take after your mother.

51
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,320
Hold your breath for a moment, please.

52
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:55,040
All clear, little lady, it's a boy.
-A boy, how so?

53
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,040
You already have me.

54
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,400
I wondering if Pietu knows anything.
I can teach.

55
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,640
Is he Pietu?
-So he said.

56
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,440
Someone has moved into Morgam.
A woman.

57
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,919
Into Morgam?  -Yes.

58
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:25,920
What kind of woman?
-Dark. Quite old, like you.

59
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,639
Did she say anything?

60
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,640
As if she knew me,
but I've never seen her.

61
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,520
I turned down her offer of juice.

62
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,120
One shouldn't disturb people unnecessarily.

63
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,360
I'll help Dad,
you read your lessons.

64
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,620
I must hunt reindeer poachers
as well as fix up the cabins.

65
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,720
Laila has come back.

66
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,960
I know, Laila is there.

67
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
People may live wherever they want.

68
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,480
Salla met her.
I should have been told.

69
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:27,840
Has she been here long?
-She did well during the week ...

70
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,920
It doesn't concern us. -Antti,
I don't care for this at all.

71
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:40,580
Do we know if she can take care of herself?
-Don't worry.

72
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,440
It's inconvenient as is.

73
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:49,760
We're having a baby, and it's difficult
for her. -She'll get used to it.

74
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,840
Forestry is hardly a godsend for us.

75
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,399
The slow growth...

76
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,400
and low productivity
are limiting factors.

77
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,660
Among reindeer there is a type of
mad cow disease in England

78
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,700
and foot and mouth disease
puts our own business in a new light.

79
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,900
Expectations are high,
because reindeer are so natural.

80
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,360
The future here in the north
should also be seen ...

81
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,799
Give it back.

82
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,800
One moment, Matias.
Put away the book, boys.

83
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,400
Do you want to comment?

84
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,439
Ellu.  -Your father has reindeer.

85
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,440
Ask him to give them to us, if he
neither keeps or eats them.

86
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,760
There are too many reindeer and
they die when the lichen disappears.

87
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,200
Predators and scavengers kill them.
-There are no predators around here.

88
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,359
Yes there are.

89
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,360
And tourists run them over.
What is this here?

90
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:57,560
A pure sapien, which is not concerned with
propagating itself and eats only waste.

91
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,680
Check this out!

92
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,080
Watch this!

93
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,440
Let go.
-Scat!

94
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,080
Thanks, but you didn't need to do it
for my sake. -It was for my sake.

95
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,520
Good that it was good enough for you.
You wouldn't have dared.

96
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,519
Morgam is back.
-Excuse me?

97
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,520
Ask yourself.
If you don't know, ask your mom.

98
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
If you dare.

99
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:58,540
Reindeer will disappear in one. And
reindeer have no tread like snowmobiles.

100
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,200
Don't look at me, Törmänen.
I know nothing about it.

101
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:10,400
How is Venesmaa?
Always in the woods with his dog.

102
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,480
We came to the village
because Simo was sick.

103
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:29,080
Talk to him, boys.

104
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:37,640
Antti's daughter is said to have
seen two wolves on the mountain.

105
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:43,500
If there are any wolves here,
Salla Köngäs would find them.

106
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,400
She has powers.
-She takes after her mother.

107
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,240
Rupi, do you happen to have a leg?
Simo is howling hungry.

108
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,280
Shouldn't you read the homework?

109
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,920
Salla, I mean it.

110
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,200
When do you go to the hospital?
-Listen, not for a long time.

111
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,600
Is it dangerous?
Can you die from it?

112
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,920
Childbirth is not easy,
but no one dies from it.

113
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,880
Why did my first mother die then?

114
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,760
Die?

115
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,320
What did you say?

116
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,040
Who said so?
She didn't die.

117
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,680
Why didn't she come after me then?

118
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,040
She couldn't.

119
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:12,680
She didn't come back from there
because she was so sick.

120
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,300
I took you and brought you here.

121
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,600
Was she crazy?

122
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:23,400
Salla, we've talked about this.

123
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:28,500
One may bear a heavy burden,
but do not be angry over it.

124
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,300
You are my girl.  That's what counts.

125
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,300
Sure.

126
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,500
<i>This case should be clear</i>

127
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,500
<i>Laila gave up custody</i>

128
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,500
There's no room for interpretation

129
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,500
-Does Salla know his background?
-We've explained it several times.

130
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:10,800
-She has not missed...
-But Laila is Morgam's biological mother.

131
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:16,000
<i>No one denies that!  But she
may request to take her back.</i>

132
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
<i>It's never easy with people
and emotions.</i>

133
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,800
<i>Yes, I understand that, but
it feels so...</i>

134
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Witch.

135
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:55,120
Is she preparing magic potion for someone?
-Or poison?

136
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,639
Who gave you permission to come here?

137
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,479
What does it matter to you?
We go where we want.

138
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,480
Witch! 
-Go now.

139
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,800
Salla.

140
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,840
What are we doing here?
I'm not coming.

141
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Hey you.
-Hello. Hi Salla.

142
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Hello.

143
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Yarn saboteur.
-What did you say?

144
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,080
You heard enough.
I saw it.

145
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,880
I checked the decision on Salla,
and it's legal.

146
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,400
It hardly matters that Laila is here.
Very well.

147
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,120
Thank you very much.
See you.  -Sure.

148
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:24,600
Forcing me there was embarrassing.
-Embarrassing?  Why?

149
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,080
You mean the boy. Matias.

150
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,879
Admit that you have
something going on with him.

151
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,280
I guarantee not.
And I'm not speaking with you.

152
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,760
Should I say something about him?
-Dunce.  Stop.

153
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,920
Find a place for it.
I need to work.

154
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,960
He never gives me anything.
What is it?

155
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:09,040
So nice!
Is it yours?

156
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,040
What do I do with it?
I get enough of them in school.

157
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:46,280
Mom!

158
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,720
I took a skiing trip to the mountains,
and triggered a bear trap.

159
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,200
It missed my leg,
but snapped the pole

160
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,920
Two men were there with a reindeer calf.
They left when they saw me.

161
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,880
I was so frightened!
Isn't it illegal?

162
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,480
Ask your father.

163
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,840
Do you have a clear conscience?
-How clean?

164
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:22,480
You've kicked shit on other people's yarn
and were rude.  What's wrong with you?

165
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,080
Who said so?
She came here and lied?

166
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:31,680
Never mind who it was.
Don't you know you don't do those things?

167
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,920
At least not you.
And especially not against her.

168
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,320
Why not against her?

169
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
In order to ... -She's my mom!
And you aren't?

170
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,120
Who told you?

171
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,360
Well, at least not you.

172
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,360
Why may I not decide
who I am?  Whose child?

173
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,640
I kicked no yarn.
-There's no question about it.

174
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,640
Salla, I have raised you and
you can beg Laila's forgiveness.

175
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,760
No.  Certainly not.

176
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:18,160
You want to avoid me
when you are going to have a baby.

177
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,720
Salla!

178
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,440
Laila, eleven years is a lifetime for
a child.  We can't change that now.

179
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,960
I won't allow it.
Salla's our girl now.

180
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:04,680
I don't want to make life difficult for you,
but you've signed the papers.

181
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:08,560
But was I myself at the time?

182
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:14,160
Shouldn't Salla not decide for herself?

183
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:17,520
Hasn't she done so clearly?

184
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,040
I ask apologize for having
teased you with the others.

185
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,840
Believe me, it won't happen again.

186
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:47,040
Can you give this Salla?

187
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,920
I can't take it,
she hasn't earned it.

188
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,680
But it belongs to Salla.
-Laila, we mustn't confuse her.

189
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,840
You shouldn't meet with Salla anymore.

190
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,440
Stop nagging, they are legal.
-Safe ...

191
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,800
From Norway.
-Sure.  Here we go.

192
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,200
The skins are perfectly legal.

193
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,760
Salla!
Where have you been?

194
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:35,280
At the forest cabin.
-And you said nothing.

195
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,920
We were afraid of the worst.
-Sorry.

196
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,760
We raised the alarm and twenty men were
out in the wilds looking for you.

197
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,199
Sorry.

198
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,200
Don't go out in the wilds again.

199
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,720
You stay on the farm and go to
the school and village.

200
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,480
And Salla.

201
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,720
You'll get a snowmobile later on.
Understood?

202
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,760
That's it.

203
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,840
Sorry, but go away!

204
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:44,560
Look Salla...

205
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I've always liked you for you are a
true forest person, not a chatterbox.

206
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:55,800
Why was Antti so upset about
Värrö's skins?  They were perfectly legal.

207
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,960
Ask Dad.
Aren't wolverines protected?

208
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,800
The skins came from Norway.

209
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,640
Aren't you underage?
Yet you're taught snowmobiling.

210
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:11,440
It's your dog too, but he drinks beer.
Isn't that animal cruelty?

211
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:21,160
You can be the police daughter as much as
you want, but don't start playing with us!

212
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,960
Simo!

213
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,280
Simo, get up!

214
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,040
You learned to spot wolves, right?

215
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:05,440
Had Simo scented the wolf on you,
he would have cut your throat.

216
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,840
You don't have to believe, but I saw them.
-What a liar! Where?

217
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,879
I don't lie.  Two, at Soaspää.

218
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,880
Soon there will be more since
the second was pregnant.

219
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,840
It's good that you told the
professionals about the wolves.

220
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,280
Soon you can sleep soundly
out there in Köngäs.

221
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,920
And soon they'll no longer disturb anyone.

222
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,400
Mom.  -Here.

223
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,400
This is my room, and my computer.

224
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Mine crashed. I'm managing the
cabin reservations.

225
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:13,440
The room will be ready for Pietu soon. -You
snipe rudely. Be careful with your words.

226
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,780
I saw wolves and nobody believes
me though one did came by.

227
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,760
What? Came by where?

228
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,960
Nothing.  I told the idiot old
men I saw a wolf.

229
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,560
Now they'll be killed.

230
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,600
You did the right thing
if they were reindeer herders.

231
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:41,920
They should see to it that the wolves don't
do something bad.  -Nobody is allowed to kill them.

232
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:46,480
Sometimes I don't understand you.

233
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,600
Here, stupid.

234
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,480
Matias!

235
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,079
What?

236
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,080
Now don't believe something like that -

237
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,760
- that I would like to be with you -

238
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,800
but I need help.

239
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,160
You put me under pressure. Dad
would hang me if he knew.

240
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,559
How do you find them in the forest?

241
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:26,560
They must be found!

242
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,600
They must be chased away
so nobody can find them.

243
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:54,640
They must be somewhere here.

244
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:01,820
There's room out here for them
to hide.  -I'll find them.

245
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,999
Damn!  No track.

246
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
It was perhaps escaped huskies.

247
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,519
They always run home to dinner.

248
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,520
We won't find any wolves
there among the stones.

249
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:26,080
Not with snowmobiles.

250
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
What was it I said?
The Köngäs girl and Matias Laiti.

251
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:45,360
I think I know what they are looking for.
We'll follow along.

252
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,320
It is she who finds wolves.

253
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:15,080
Stay!

254
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,160
Fresh tracks!

255
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,760
There!

256
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:36,160
Go now!

257
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:46,560
We need to get in front of them!
We'll drive around, speed up!

258
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,760
No!

259
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,920
Watch it with your machine gun.
There are children around.

260
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:01,240
What? I saved them of course.

261
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:04,400
She would have been eaten
if I hadn't shot.

262
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:09,680
The wolf pretended to be dead
and would have attacked.

263
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,720
Pretended to be dead ...

264
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:17,320
Wolf ...

265
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:20,880
What did it do to you?

266
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,960
Laiti's snowmobile became scrap metal.

267
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:30,560
Your dad should be so happy.

268
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:38,480
We'll take you to the nearest house.
We'll see how we do in the morning.

269
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:43,080
But, guys, tonight
there will be hunting party.

270
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,960
I jumped down and
took the shot on reflex.

271
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:59,680
In fact, it was a neck shot.

272
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:08,160
It was dead.
She had driven over it.

273
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,640
Should she get the skin then?

274
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,320
For your home.

275
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,880
I don't want it. Take the whole animal.

276
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,759
Sorry.

277
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:03,760
Go away.

278
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:17,080
I want out of here.

279
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:43,740
Sorry, Dad.
I had to.  Absolutely had to.

280
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:50,040
You had to, so it can't be helped.

281
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:56,320
Venesmaa and the other wolf are in
Nillas cabin.

282
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,960
Where do you think we're coming from?

283
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,480
Take Salla directly home.
Your father is waiting.

284
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:07,680
Tomorrow you'll take the
snowmobile to Lompolo.

285
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,480
We need to talk about the consequences.

286
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:33,560
Mom! Do you spell it Po or Poo?

287
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:40,760
Salla. You have a visitor.

288
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:48,279
Salla Köngäs.

289
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:55,280
The reindeer team will reward you with
200 euros for a job well done.

290
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,480
Slaughter Money.  No thanks.

291
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:05,080
Salla, there's a scholarship.

292
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:09,780
As a thank you for having helped
save tens of reindeer.

293
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:13,999
Buy candy or get a moped.

294
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Give it to Venesmaa.
I won't accept it.

295
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:30,560
I'll add it to her study funds.
We need a lot.

296
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:21,760
Very well. -Thank you.

297
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,799
Wait a minute.

298
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:31,800
Salla also won the nature competition
and she gets a prize ...

299
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:35,840
It is ... -A wolf-whip!

300
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:40,039
Shut it,
otherwise, I'll shut it!

301
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:43,040
What are the pure sapiens whining about?

302
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:51,080
Vellu would still like to sit next to mommy.

303
00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:01,120
Thanks for your help.
You didn't need to.

304
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:05,320
In return.

305
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:10,640
What will you do on summer vacation?

306
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:15,120
Could we go somewhere together and...

307
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,719
And kiss?

308
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:24,220
No, I didn't mean that.
For a soda or something.

309
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:31,100
I like to be out in the mountains
and you sit at your computer.

310
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:35,360
It's true, but one never knows.

311
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:18,959
Is the cabin vacant?

312
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,439
Yes, so you?

313
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:25,440
I was going to go home,
the coffee is ready.

314
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:30,720
Therefore, I will too. -I'll have coffee.
Have you tried the sauna?

315
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:35,840
Not that one.

316
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:39,920
Help!

317
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:45,480
What is it?
-It's stuck.

318
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,960
I saw the wolf. It had two pups.

319
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:13,640
I killed one during the winter,
perhaps the father.

320
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:21,600
What could you do about it? All are
of course someone's pups.

321
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:29,160
Not me.

322
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:33,360
I do not know whose I am.

323
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:39,680
Laila did not mean something bad.

324
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:45,480
I don't want to talk about it.

325
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:20,400
In the forest it is such that those who
come last get the best places.

326
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:25,600
This place is ours.

327
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:31,840
Well, we can go.

328
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:55,240
Simo!

329
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:01,840
Get out, stay there!

330
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:30,959
Guys, up!
The wolf will tear up Simo!

331
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:33,960
What now?  -Wolf!

332
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:42,360
There!

333
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:58,480
Simo. -It is so bad to take
a dog in the house.

334
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,919
I'll take my revenge.

335
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:11,920
It's best that we go.
It's starting to go wrong.

336
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:20,280
Now they'll die.

337
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:57,080
If only it had taken cover.
-It can swim better than a dog.

338
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:08,280
Too far.

339
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:17,720
Pups stand no chance against them!

340
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:21,480
What do we do with them?
-We can't let Venesmaa get them!

341
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:34,960
Somewhere here?

342
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:59,760
There!

343
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:04,760
Here!

344
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:08,360
Venesmaa's gang is coming soon,
they saw me.

345
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:15,280
Go back a ways.

346
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:39,040
Backpacks, quickly!

347
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:42,600
They're nearby.

348
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:55,120
How did you know what to do?
-I didn't know.

349
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:03,400
The nest is fresh, a horrible stench,
but no one at home.

350
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:09,040
Yeah so there. Do they think the
Köngäs girl deserves a scholarship?

351
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:14,620
Shouldn't we talk to Antti?  It is
a police request, the wolf killed Simo.

352
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:20,200
It is probably best that we 
take care of it ourselves.

353
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:25,640
I'm afraid Laiti's boy may go
into some damn animal protection.

354
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:33,800
I want the female.

355
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:48,760
Nobody comes here in summer.
They're staying overnight.

356
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:51,679
Couldn't they stay with you?

357
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:54,680
The house is full of reindeer dogs,
and wolves under the bed.

358
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:58,480
This is a good hiding place.

359
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:08,640
They drove past.

360
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:10,480
Salla! Wake up!

361
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:14,680
They have escaped!
They dug themselves out!

362
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:22,720
Salla! Where are you going?

363
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:25,639
You promised to clean the cabins!

364
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:28,640
Speed up!

365
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:36,200
They must be found!

366
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:46,080
Watch.  Unbelievable.

367
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:53,640
Don't look there. It's Venesmaa.
I'm going to the store.

368
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:56,880
Take the back road, catch the pups
and put them in a dustbin.

369
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Now we have a track on the little ones.

370
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:06,400
They're decoys.

371
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:40,640
Come on and hunt wolves, girl,
the village men can't do it.

372
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:47,600
You know what I read in the newspaper?

373
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:54,060
The Italians are said to have a dog
which will match a bear.

374
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:58,240
Should I order one?
-A useful creature.

375
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:01,880
It scents wolf pups
in a safe four meters deep.

376
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:08,160
Don't forget this.

377
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:15,959
In a safe?

378
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:18,960
They followed you here!
-They know.  What do we do now?

379
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:29,920
Look out!

380
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:39,640
We don't have many choices.

381
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:42,920
Venesmaa is following you.

382
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:46,280
There is a place,
but you won't like it.

383
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:06,960
Thank you.

384
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:21,880
Laila has an empty cage in the shed.

385
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:25,399
The pups will be taken to the female

386
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:28,400
and rubbed with peat
so they don't smell strange.

387
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:35,020
Is that what Laila said?
-Yes.  She knows about animals.

388
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:38,920
But you didn't leave the box.

389
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:43,280
Well, it's a good box.

390
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:58,760
Does the young pair need a ride?
-No, thanks.

391
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:08,400
There will be an equipment inspection.

392
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:26,920
Say where they are!

393
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:14,860
Salla! Where were you? You were supposed
to clean the cabins, but ran off!

394
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:18,280
You can't be trusted.
-I'll clean up.

395
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:21,400
They are already cleaned.
Now help with serving instead.

396
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:25,280
We have a bus load of customers.
-Yes, yes!

397
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:28,440
From now on, you're staying at home!
-I'm sorry then!

398
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:11,480
I know what you're doing.

399
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:18,039
What do you want...

400
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:21,040
or do you just haunt
someone else's house?

401
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:24,560
You have a reputation that
draws attention.

402
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:27,960
Do you remember how you endangered
our children?

403
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:33,160
What do you know about them?
Beat it, you crazy bitch.

404
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:36,840
I leaving, maybe far away,

405
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:42,080
but I swear that I'll return if you
don't let Salla be.

406
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:47,200
It's best if you take care of yourself!

407
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:26,880
Hello, is Antti home?

408
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:30,840
Not now.
-He wasn't at the station either.

409
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:39,020
I intended to ask about licenses.
The shotgun came in yesterday.

410
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:43,160
I applied for it a month ago.

411
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:46,520
I don't know anything about it.
You better ask Antti.

412
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:50,600
Everything seems to take a
long time for me.

413
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:55,480
You're a sensitive person.

414
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:06,439
Thanks, Kirsti.

415
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:09,440
It was beautifully told.

416
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Can I use the toilet?

417
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:16,040
Venesmaa came to our house!

418
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:20,600
We'll cross the river with the pups.
First thing in the morning.

419
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:25,840
Good.

420
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:35,719
Hunting Day.

421
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:39,320
Come to the cemetary in the morning
with all of the equipment.  Understood?

422
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:42,960
Did you get a tip?
-Failproof information.

423
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:47,520
Antero.

424
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:51,200
Wolves may well be useful.
They get blamed for everything.

425
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:56,120
I don't care about the benefits now.
I want to get the female.

426
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:24,520
Salla.

427
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:29,520
I want you to know...

428
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:32,720
that I didn't leave you out of malice.

429
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:44,760
I couldn't get back to you for a
long time because I was so sick.

430
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:49,080
Later on I didn't dare.

431
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:52,520
I was so ashamed.  Ashamed of what
I did to you.

432
01:10:56,240 --> 01:10:59,240
Later on it seemed to be too late.

433
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:03,040
Why did you come?

434
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Not to upset you.

435
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:11,320
I wanted you to know that I exist.

436
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:19,240
Thanks for your help.

437
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:39,919
Where did you find that?

438
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:42,920
It was lying there. Whose is it?

439
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:48,800
Some child's, certainly.
-Don't you know her?

440
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:55,600
Maybe.

441
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:58,760
Why don't I know?

442
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:06,280
I'm afraid I'll suddenly wake up and
find out that I'm somebody else.

443
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:13,400
Salla, you're Salla.
Everyone knows that, at least I do.

444
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:17,440
Can't you just be she?

445
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:40,680
Sorry, but go away

446
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:56,320
I should have guessed that they're here.
It would be best if we dig them out.

447
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:03,860
No, they're no longer here.
We'll follow them to the river.

448
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:08,280
We need to get there
before they cross.

449
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:46,880
Sorry, but Salla needs help.

450
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:52,240
Don't be offended, but I told you
that Salla should be left in peace.

451
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:58,360
She isn't home.
She's fishing with Matias Laiti.

452
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:02,360
They're not fishing.

453
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,599
What is that?

454
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:19,600
How could they have known the route?

455
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:22,920
We'll never make it across the river.

456
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:26,200
Through the rocks. An all-terrain vehicle
won't make it through.

457
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:48,960
I didn't realize that Venesmaa
came to us for Salla's sake.

458
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:54,160
It's for wolves.
-Wolves ...

459
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:59,240
In the spring, Antti became fed up with 
Salla for the wolves' sake. -Pups, two.

460
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:03,560
They're also kids themselves.
What were you thinking?

461
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:08,920
Now I feel nothing anymore.

462
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:14,560
Now I won't leave Salla in the lurch.

463
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:33,600
There they are!
Hurry up, boys!

464
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:37,080
After them! Up there!

465
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:03,160
Excuse me.
-What? What?

466
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:07,320
His wife asked me to say
they went to the mountains.

467
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:11,119
Why did a pregnant woman go there?

468
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:14,120
Perhaps her daughter
had gone astray.

469
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:19,760
Excuse me.
His wife asked me to watch his house...

470
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:23,120
Törmänen! Come back!

471
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:36,920
We need to get to the river. It will
be difficult, but I've done it.

472
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:41,080
With a wolf on your back?

473
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,000
What will happen now?

474
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:31,600
If I could meet her
and know something of Salla.

475
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:37,720
I meant that the road ends,
and I have my queasy stomache.

476
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:50,719
They went down to the river.

477
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:53,720
Lompolo, run along the ridge
and down to the river.

478
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:58,800
We'll go here and
surround them.

479
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:15,519
There are hiding somewhere.

480
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:18,520
How will we cross? -Farther along
there's a bend.  That will work.

481
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:37,560
Watch out.

482
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:42,160
We must trudge on.
-Stay.

483
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:46,520
Certainly not.  -You can't
run here, you're pregnant.

484
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:53,220
We don't have time if you must
stop to catch your breath.

485
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:59,040
Why did we come here?
-I don't where they are ...

486
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:02,440
I, I, I!
You're a bloody idiot!

487
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:06,760
Antero, they're heading to the bend.
They won't cross without a boat.

488
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:12,200
We'd better not hunt children.

489
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:15,400
Wait here.  I'll look around.

490
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:50,460
Who do we have here?
Isn't it Salla Köngäs?

491
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:54,720
I see it's Salla.

492
01:20:55,240 --> 01:20:58,240
What is it that
looking out of the backpacks?

493
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:08,760
Now it has come to this, girl.
Ask Laiti's boy over here.

494
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:14,720
Jump in!
I've done it before!

495
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:19,240
My God, what are they doing?

496
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:22,520
Are you crazy?
Don't kill yourselves!

497
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:26,280
Antero, put away the gun!

498
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:45,560
Laila, I shot accidentally.
-Laila, ignore that.

499
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,879
You didn't believe me,
though I warned you.

500
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:51,880
The blame is always on Antero;
no matter how hard I try to do right.

501
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:57,800
Well, the skins were my fault
and the reindeer was my fault, but ...

502
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:03,759
the wolf tore up my dog.

503
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:08,760
and Paulus tried to help me,
but to no avail.  -What do you say?

504
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:13,080
Sorry.

505
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:04,760
How could you do that with the snowmobile?
-I saw it on TV.

506
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:09,480
You said you had done it.
-No.

507
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:13,640
And on TV the sled sank.

508
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:18,199
You are definitely crazy.

509
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:21,200
Yes, I am.

510
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:52,960
Salla.

511
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:58,600
I don't like
that you stay overnight.

512
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:03,180
Dad, it's exactly 952 meters home.
I've measured.
