1
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,100
Where the hell's that doctor?

2
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,200
She's 10 minutes late.

3
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:09,700
Relax, she'll be here.

4
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,900
We're wasting time.

5
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,100
I should've kept that blood

6
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,400
and done this myself.

7
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,600
Why is it that every
time you take matters

8
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,700
into your own hands, you screw things up?

9
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,700
You've made enough enemies around here.

10
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,800
People don't trust you.

11
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,000
Why?

12
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,400
Because of Greg's death?

13
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,600
I didn't have any time.

14
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,400
Stop.

15
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,300
You know, you can't go
around taking people out,

16
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,700
just because you feel threatened.

17
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,000
Who are you kiddin', Miller?

18
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,600
You'd have done the same thing yourself.

19
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,100
It's about time you got here.

20
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,100
Have you finished with your tests?

21
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,200
Where did you get this blood?

22
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,500
Never mind where we got it.

23
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,200
What's the problem?

24
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,500
This.

25
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,300
It's an extra chromosome.

26
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,500
That means it's not human.

27
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,600
Who cares?

28
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,000
Is it diseased?

29
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,100
You know there's been
a lot of speculation

30
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,600
about the origin of this blood.

31
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,700
Well, you know better than to, um,

32
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,200
believe these kinds of rumors.

33
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,400
Don't you, Doctor?

34
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,100
We'll find out eventually.

35
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,400
It's your job to tell us

36
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,300
if the blood is diseased,

37
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,600
nothing more.

38
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,600
Is this all that's left of the blood?

39
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,300
Where the hell's the rest of it?

40
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,600
That's all we have.

41
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,300
There's nothing left for us.

42
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,100
I have to warn you.

43
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
If you should use it on anyone,

44
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,500
the body's immune system will treat it

45
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,600
like an infection.

46
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,900
The subject's blood will putrefy

47
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,400
into a puss-like fluid.

48
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,700
The body will swell up like a balloon.

49
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,600
There'll be vomiting and fever.

50
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,800
And the result will be a horrifying death.

51
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,100
Well, now, that's not
a very pretty picture.

52
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,200
Is it, Doctor?

53
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,300
I assure you we are doing
nothing out of line.

54
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,000
You dragged your feet on
this long enough, Doctor.

55
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
How long's it take to get an answer?

56
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,700
I can't tell you that.

57
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,700
I'm going as fast as I can.

58
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,500
You'll have to excuse us, Doctor,

59
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,500
but we're all under a
lot of pressure here.

60
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,400
We need an answer.

61
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,700
I'll try to get it done by next week.

62
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,800
But I can't promise.

63
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,900
I'm not waiting another week.

64
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,300
Why don't I just take the blood?

65
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,500
Because I'm not gonna let you.

66
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,300
Your hands are tied until she signs off.

67
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,000
Nobody ties my hands.

68
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,100
I spent most of my life
lookin' for this blood.

69
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,400
I'm not waiting.

70
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,000
Now you're gonna follow our game plan,

71
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,500
because if you don't, they're
gonna take a hard look

72
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,100
at what we're doing here,

73
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,600
and I don't want anyone reviewing us yet.

74
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,700
It'd drag both of our careers down.

75
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,900
And just so's you know,

76
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm not gonna let that happen.

77
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,300
Are you very clear on that?

78
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,500
You worry too much, Miller.

79
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,700
Butler!

80
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,500
You okay?

81
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,400
What are you lookin' at?

82
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,100
Get outta here!

83
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,400
Yes, sir.

84
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,000
What is this
shape-changing crap?

85
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,600
Forget the way and
could have gotten dark power

86
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,700
that descend from werewolves.

87
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,700
Butler!

88
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,900
What the hell's going on here?

89
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,000
Leave it off.

90
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,200
The light hurts my eyes.

91
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,000
What did you do with the blood?

92
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,300
You took it, didn't you?

93
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,000
Of course, I did.

94
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,900
There's nothing left.

95
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:58,900
You took the last of it.

96
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,400
Now we'll have lots
of blood to work with,

97
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,500
right here,

98
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,300
in me.

99
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,300
Wow, you idiot, you could've died.

100
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,900
But I didn't.

101
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,300
Did I?

102
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,400
Have the doctors look at that.

103
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,300
I don't need anybody looking at it.

104
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,300
It's working.

105
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,800
The blood's changing me.

106
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:28,400
My senses are so keen I can hear Dr Taylor

107
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,500
and Dr Barnes making fun
about our trip to Budapest.

108
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,200
Get to the infirmary now.

109
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,600
Damn you, Miller, you're
not even listening to me.

110
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,600
I can hear your heartbeat.

111
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,500
It's going a little fast, isn't it?

112
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,100
Pitter-pat.

113
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,800
Pitter-pat.

114
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,300
Pitter-pat.

115
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,400
Getting nervous?

116
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,100
I don't scare that easily.

117
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
You stink of fear.

118
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,300
I can smell it.

119
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,700
Look at you.

120
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,200
All your muscles wound up tight,

121
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,600
ready to save your ass.

122
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,600
You know what I feel like?

123
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,900
Like killing.

124
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,200
You're being very stupid, Butler.

125
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,900
We still don't understand
what we're dealing with here,

126
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:23,800
and you just...

127
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,400
I'm taking back what was lost

128
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,700
through millions of years of evolution.

129
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,000
I'll be a new kind of warrior,

130
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,600
changing shape at will.

131
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,800
I'll have the instincts of an animal

132
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,000
and the brain of a man.

133
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,800
I'm terminating this, right now!

134
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,500
You'll never terminate this project.

135
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:43,900
Watch me.

136
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,800
I'm gonna live forever, Miller.

137
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,900
Jeez!

138
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,800
Mr Butler, you startled me.

139
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,000
Are you okay?

140
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,800
Oh what happened?

141
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,200
I just...

142
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,700
What are you doing?

143
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,500
Michelle!

144
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,000
Oh my God!

145
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,200
What happened?

146
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,700
Butler.

147
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,900
That's all right, come here, come here.

148
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:20,900
Calm down.

149
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,200
Come and sit down.

150
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,300
It's all right, come on.

151
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,200
Everything's gonna be
just fine, I promise.

152
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,900
What the hell's going on?

153
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,100
Michelle, what happened?

154
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:33,700
Butler.

155
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,300
That son of a bitch.

156
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:37,900
Butler, you son of a bitch.

157
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,100
This thing's out of control, Butler.

158
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,540
Butler?

159
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,100
Butler?

160
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,400
Wash the bodies carefully

161
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,400
and take them to cryonics.

162
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,900
I want them in freezers immediately.

163
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,400
We have to do an autopsy, sir.

164
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,600
That's standard procedure.

165
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,400
No.

166
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,600
Yes, sir.

167
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,000
They should be incinerated.

168
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
That way, there won't be any evidence.

169
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,000
No, I can't do that.

170
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,100
I think we're just gonna put everything

171
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,500
on hold for a while.

172
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,300
We need to find a way
to control the process,

173
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,600
maybe even enhance it.

174
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,400
Okay, then we need to do a full prep.

175
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,800
Do you want to replace
the blood with glycol

176
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,900
before they're frozen?

177
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,000
No, it's too dangerous.

178
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,900
If the bullets get dislodged,

179
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,000
all hell will break loose.

180
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,200
Mr Miller?

181
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,200
Ah, how's the girl?

182
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,600
Uh, she's still sleeping.

183
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,300
Good, I'll send a medevac unit down

184
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,400
to get her out of here.

185
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,100
How are you doing?

186
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,500
I'll survive.

187
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,000
I'm sorry you had to see
all of this, Dr Barnes.

188
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,700
It's created a lot of problems for us.

189
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Unfortunately, you're gonna have

190
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,300
to surrender all of your records.

191
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,400
Everything associated
with this program has

192
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,400
to be destroyed.

193
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,900
But you can't destroy all this.

194
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,700
We need our records to...

195
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,700
I don't have time to
argue with you, Dr Barnes.

196
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,000
Please show Agent Berger to your office.

197
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,700
When you're through,

198
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,600
send her body down to
cryonics with the others.

199
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,800
Hmm, well,

200
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,500
this little experiment just gets more

201
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,600
and more interesting, doesn't it?

202
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,300
I'm sorry, my friend,

203
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,300
but you were getting a little out of hand.

204
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:24,000
And this intermission
will give us both time

205
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,300
to work out the wrinkles,
so to speak.

206
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,800
Oh while you're in there,

207
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,000
work on that attitude of yours, buddy.

208
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,100
- Yeah?
- Where are you?

209
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,600
You said you'd be here over an hour ago.

210
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,200
Oh, you know, I'm right
in the middle of something.

211
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,300
Have Roger sit in for me.

212
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,700
Roger always loses.

213
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,000
I do not.

214
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,100
I'm playing.

215
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,300
Besides, I need you here for good luck.

216
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,800
Oh come on, Anna!

217
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,100
Take a break and have some fun.

218
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,700
Anna, I need you down here.

219
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:38,900
It's high stakes.

220
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,100
I need your money.

221
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,400
Guys, I have to go.

222
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,900
Count me out, all right.

223
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:46,700
I'll talk to you later.

224
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,100
She's not comin'.

225
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,200
Stop chasin' that girl

226
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,200
and concentrate on the game.

227
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,700
Get the message.

228
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,900
Deep down, I know she really likes me.

229
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,500
She sure has a
funny way of showin' it,

230
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,200
like tellin' you to take a hike.

231
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,600
The only thing that matters

232
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,400
to her is that substitute skin.

233
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,600
Five Card Stud, suicide kings wild.

234
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:28,900
Hi.

235
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,400
We missed you last night.

236
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,400
It was a great game.

237
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,100
I lost track of the time.

238
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,100
Larry won $15 from General Hammond.

239
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,200
Oh, what did Hammond say?

240
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,600
He didn't take it too well.

241
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,800
You know how he gets
when he loses to an NCO.

242
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,500
Yeah, especially Larry.

243
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,800
- Here.
- Thank you.

244
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:54,800
So how's it going?

245
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,000
Oh I started electroplating
at two this morning.

246
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,200
The metal ions fused to the tissue.

247
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,900
I increased the oxygen by 3/10%.

248
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,300
These first specimens hardened again.

249
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,100
This one, I'm still waiting on.

250
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,100
What do you think?

251
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,800
It's still hard to believe it's made

252
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,200
of metal and synthetic tissue.

253
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,500
It's been stable
for about three hours now.

254
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,500
Well, if you
can keep it that way,

255
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,600
a lot of cancer victims
will be very grateful.

256
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,100
I don't know what else to do.

257
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,800
Think maybe I'm just to close to it.

258
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,200
Well, to add to our
problems, we've got to deal

259
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,200
with a new so-called expert
Washington is sending.

260
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,800
- Hmm.
- I've never heard of him.

261
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,500
There's nothing about him

262
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,500
in any reference manual.

263
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,400
- That's good.
- And on top of that,

264
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,800
I don't know a thing about his research.

265
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,100
All the right reasons for them

266
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,300
to send for them to him to work with us.

267
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,400
Well, if he can help,

268
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,500
then we can move on to animal testing.

269
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,200
Think of the burn victims,
people with skin cancer.

270
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,600
We'd be able to graft
whole areas of the body.

271
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,200
So Washington has put me
in charge of the program,

272
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,800
and I am personally responsible

273
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,900
for keeping it funded.

274
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,500
Ah.
- Sorry.

275
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,400
Uh-huh.

276
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,900
- Roger?
- Oh, sorry, sir.

277
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,200
I feel it's time we start human testing.

278
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,000
Excuse me, Colonel,
that doesn't make sense.

279
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,200
We're still having a lot of problems.

280
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,300
I know.

281
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,700
I've monitored your work
for the past five years.

282
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,600
I know all of your successes
and all of your failures.

283
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,200
And I feel you're ready to move on.

284
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,200
We still can't control
the hardening process.

285
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,100
We've never been able to keep it stable.

286
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,800
Sometimes, it works, but sometimes,

287
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,200
we end up with skin as hard as steel.

288
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,800
I'm well aware of that.

289
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,600
If that were to happen,
it would kill the subject,

290
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,000
which brings up the
question of volunteers.

291
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,000
Well, we won't be using volunteers,

292
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,100
not in the usual sense.

293
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,200
What are you planning on using?

294
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,400
Frozen cadavers.

295
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,300
Cadavers?

296
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,000
Are you nuts?

297
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,800
The cryonics team

298
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,500
at Fort Meade has rehydrated
outer skin tissue.

299
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,900
They have kept it alive for months

300
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,500
on a grid of polylactic acid.

301
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,800
Their work fits perfectly into yours.

302
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,200
But how's that gonna advance our work?

303
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,400
Synthetic tissue is not the same

304
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,000
as rehydrated frozen tissue.

305
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,300
Mm-hmm?

306
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,000
What we're doing here
is creating living skin

307
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,100
from metal and tissue.

308
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,500
I am merging the two programs,

309
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,700
all the support that is
in those folders there,

310
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,900
along with your new orders.

311
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,200
What if we say no?

312
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,100
Oh I don't think you want to do that.

313
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,200
Why not?

314
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,700
Well, because I'll cut your funding.

315
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,700
That's outrageous, Colonel.

316
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,800
Where do you get off coming down here

317
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,000
and disrupting our work?

318
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,400
Hmm, that's very nice.

319
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,500
Look, either you cooperate,

320
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,100
or I will just simply take your research,

321
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,400
give it to all those
nice folks at Fort Meade,

322
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,600
and they can take all the credit.

323
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,400
Well, do I have your cooperation?

324
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,800
Yes.

325
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,200
Your full cooperation, General?

326
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,200
You'll have it.

327
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,200
I'll deliver the first
cadaver some time next week.

328
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,400
Why are you all so glum?

329
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,000
You're scientists.

330
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,300
Isn't this how you people have fun?

331
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,700
Well, Donald, it's time for
you to rise from the dead.

332
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,000
There have been some unusual developments,

333
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,300
these past 20 years.

334
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,500
These so-called scientists
don't even know it,

335
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,400
but they're gonna give
you a skin of steel.

336
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,300
You'll be indestructible

337
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,700
and under my control.

338
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,700
What's he saying?

339
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,100
He's a little upset.

340
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:34,900
- Do you understand me?
- Si.

341
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,000
I will not work here

342
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,100
until it is sprinkled with holy water.

343
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,000
Okay.

344
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:40,800
Wait a minute, holy water?

345
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,500
How are we gonna get that?
- Hey, don't...

346
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,200
How do I know?

347
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,000
Call a priest, a bishop,

348
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,400
have the Pope send it FedEx.

349
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,500
I don't cook!

350
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,000
- Ramon!
- I go on strike.

351
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,100
Ramon,.

352
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:54,800
That means we're gonna
be eating peanut butter

353
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,900
and jelly sandwiches again.

354
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:57,600
I don't blame him.

355
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,900
I'd be upset, too.

356
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,400
This is ridiculous.
- Thank you.

357
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,650
Okay.

358
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:10,000
I have feeling we're
getting off to a bad start.

359
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,700
I think you've
been out of practice

360
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,050
with medicine for too long.

361
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:15,600
All right, have Debbie run
a complete pathology test

362
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,250
on the tissue and a molecular
model of the hair, okay?

363
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:19,500
Okay.

364
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,340
Thanks.

365
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,240
I don't know
where that body came from.

366
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,890
What if it was used for
germ warfare experiments, hmm?

367
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:26,540
I mean, the last thing we need is

368
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,540
to contract some kind of exotic disease.

369
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:30,040
It has a clean bill of health.

370
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,540
It came from the cryonics
lab in Langley, Virginia.

371
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:34,890
Germ warfare is done at
Plum Island in New York.

372
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:36,090
I'm not lifting a finger

373
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:37,640
until I have all the paperwork.

374
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,140
Ah, well, then you're in luck,

375
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,090
because here it is.

376
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:41,700
Come on, Colonel,

377
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,700
you're gonna have to do better than this.

378
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,100
This file is inadequate.

379
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,200
This cadaver has VIP written all over it.

380
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,500
There isn't a clue as to who he is

381
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,300
or where he came from.

382
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,100
Ah, well, medically, it's clean.

383
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,100
For all I know, it could
be somebody else's records.

384
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,800
I don't want to work on him.

385
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,900
No problem here, Doctor,

386
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,300
except for the one you're creating.

387
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,700
I don't like it.

388
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,400
It makes me feel uneasy.

389
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:05,700
What are you afraid of?

390
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,000
I said I was uneasy.

391
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,400
There's a difference.

392
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,900
You're putting us under a lot of pressure.

393
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,700
Well, you're the expert
in freeze-dried tissue.

394
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,200
You could do this with your eyes closed.

395
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:22,800
Why don't you start on this
one, and I'll see what I can do

396
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,700
about getting you a fresher specimen?

397
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,100
Please.

398
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,800
There's adrenaline in the cells.

399
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,100
He died violently.
- Mm-hmm.

400
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,400
It looks like a heart attack.

401
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,200
Take a look at this.

402
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,300
I analyzed six samples.

403
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,300
All of them were consistent.

404
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,100
Your subject consumed
high amounts of raw meat.

405
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,500
The striations show high
levels of saturated fats,

406
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,500
cholesterol, tannin and sulfites.

407
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,100
It looks like he was a
very self-indulgent person.

408
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,200
What happened to the hair follicles?

409
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,300
It went through some
sort of molecular disarray,

410
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,600
just before the subject died.

411
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,300
I haven't a clue.

412
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,000
Its whole structure was reformed.

413
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,800
But I did find something
that was interesting.

414
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,400
I found a piece of dirt
embedded in the hair platelet.

415
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,500
I traced this down to salt deposits

416
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,600
along the Danube River.

417
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,700
Which part?

418
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,100
Somewhere near Budapest.

419
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,500
And if you think that's interesting,

420
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,000
I tried cross-referencing
the numbers on his file.

421
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,200
I was denied access.

422
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,300
That means they do know

423
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,400
who he is.
- Exactly.

424
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,500
We can still find out.

425
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,700
All you need to do is
bring me his fingerprints.

426
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,500
I'll run them through the FBI computer.

427
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,300
Great.

428
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,100
I'll get them right to you.

429
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,600
Decision time, Deb.

430
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,500
You know, personally,

431
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,200
I think this Miller guy
is doing us a favor.

432
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,600
I'm getting a little tired
of the same old stuff.

433
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,100
Boo-yah!

434
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,000
Ah, I don't really
care what we use it on.

435
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,700
Come on, it's $4 to you.

436
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,500
Ugh, I fold.

437
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,400
Well, Miller's results are impressive,

438
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,000
and I can't find an error in his theories,

439
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,100
but I still don't like the guy.

440
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,500
It's too rich for my blood.

441
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,700
Well, I'm up for review.

442
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,700
Get me another star and a raise.

443
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,700
So don't start with him.

444
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,700
I'll see you and raise you.

445
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,300
Hmm?

446
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,100
It could be exciting.

447
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,300
Are you trying to
bluff me with that hand?

448
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,800
Put your cards on the table.

449
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,400
Full house, jacks and 10s.

450
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:57,600
Ooh.

451
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,200
Royal flush.

452
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,400
I knew it.

453
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,600
She beat you.

454
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,200
What do you got to do
to win a hand around here?

455
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,500
- Mine, baby.
- Yes!

456
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,800
I guess that somebody's cheating here.

457
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,700
Somebody's cheating here.

458
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,000
This is...

459
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,100
- Thank you for playing.
- What do you got

460
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:22,800
to do to win a hand?

461
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,700
Beginning the resection.

462
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,800
- Steady.
- Take it slow.

463
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,000
Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

464
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,300
- Take it easy, good.
- Mm-hmm, got it.

465
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,200
Okay.

466
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:10,700
There.

467
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:12,900
Skin tissue removed.

468
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,000
Philip, you set?

469
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,500
Just a second.

470
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,500
Ready with the next section of bio-ferrin.

471
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,900
Dipping in the acid bath.

472
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,700
On site.

473
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,500
In position.

474
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,400
Roger, what's the body temperature?

475
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,900
54, 54 degrees.

476
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:50,800
Hand me the positive plate, please.

477
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,300
94 volts.

478
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:57,400
Readjust it to 90, so it
doesn't harden, hopefully.

479
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,400
What's the difference?

480
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,300
He's a stiff.

481
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:01,700
That's very good, Larry.

482
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,700
You're set at 90.

483
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,600
Surgery laser up.

484
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,400
Laser's up.

485
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,400
I have a positive charge
over the graft site.

486
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,900
Cauterizing one.

487
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,300
Cauterizing two.

488
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,500
Roger.

489
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:23,800
Laser's down.

490
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,200
Resection complete.

491
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,000
If the colonel's plan works,

492
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,700
you will cut two years off the program.

493
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,400
We'll know in four hours.

494
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,300
I can't believe we got peanut
butter and jelly for lunch.

495
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,000
You know, I don't know about you three,

496
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,800
but this food situation
has gotten way out of hand.

497
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,600
I didn't think he was serious, but...

498
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,400
Why don't we just put some water

499
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,500
into a bottle and give it to him?

500
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,500
I tried that.

501
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,500
He busted me.
- Oh.

502
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:49,700
He busted you?

503
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,100
But I did try.

504
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,700
It's bad enough having
Colonel Miller hanging

505
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,400
over our shoulder.

506
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,900
Yeah, I can't handle that either,

507
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,700
that and trying to eat leftovers.

508
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,200
Maybe these cadavers aren't a bad idea.

509
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,000
At least, we don't have to feed 'em.

510
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,300
There you go, again,

511
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,800
always thinkin' about food.

512
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,700
Will you two please stop it?

513
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,100
We are trying to concentrate.

514
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,000
Calipers.

515
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:11,900
I think you better check this out.

516
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:13,500
What's the matter?

517
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,000
I'm reading inorganic
material on the sternum.

518
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,200
That doesn't make any sense.

519
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:19,400
Come take a look.

520
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:25,500
Enhance it.

521
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,800
Why didn't you tell me about this before?

522
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,600
I just noticed it.

523
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:41,700
This is mortician's wax.

524
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:46,600
Get some gauze.

525
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,700
These are bullet wounds.

526
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:00,700
Hand me the forceps.

527
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:01,800
Right here.

528
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,300
This man was shot, folks.

529
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,300
This man was executed.

530
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,500
What the hell?

531
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,800
These bullets look like silver.

532
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:27,500
Yeah.

533
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,500
I'm terminating the experiment.

534
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,400
Come on now.

535
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,900
Oh no, we got another problem.

536
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,100
The body temperature's rising.

537
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,100
It's up seven degrees.

538
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:39,400
With a metabolic process.

539
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,200
It's above room level.

540
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,500
Anna, he's starting to bleed.

541
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,400
84 degrees!

542
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,000
Shut the pumps.

543
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,200
He's still bleeding.

544
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,600
I can't feel a muscle.

545
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,400
I'm not touchin' it.

546
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,400
There's heat.

547
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,300
I'm readin' 90 degrees here.

548
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,200
Roger, don't just stand there!

549
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,600
Get something to tie him down.

550
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:11,400
What?

551
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,700
- I don't care, anything!
- Get something!

552
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:14,400
Get him!

553
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,600
Get the oxygen!
- What?

554
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,700
Give him oxygen!

555
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:19,400
He's alive.

556
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,600
Give him oxygen!

557
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,300
Do we have any glucose?

558
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,100
Oh my God.

559
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,100
He's alive.

560
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,600
I think I'm gonna be sick.

561
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,100
What the hell are you doin',

562
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,300
sending us a body with bullets in it,

563
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:56,500
silver bullets?

564
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,700
I haven't the slightest idea

565
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:58,600
what you're talking about.

566
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,300
Don't bullshit me, Colonel.

567
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,800
That cadaver didn't just
fall out of the sky.

568
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:03,400
Well, let's hope not.

569
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:05,200
You know what I mean.

570
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,000
Leslie, you know everything that I know

571
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:07,700
about this program.

572
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,700
Don't call me Leslie.

573
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,000
How can you act so cool about this?

574
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,500
The question is,

575
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,300
where do we go from here?

576
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,600
We are trying to
understand what happened.

577
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,700
What if he regains consciousness?

578
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:20,600
That's impossible.

579
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,700
His brain's been dead for years.

580
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,500
Okay, fine, fine, but what if?

581
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,700
Then we have no right
to experiment on him.

582
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,300
It's too late.

583
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,200
He's already covered in bio-ferrin.

584
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,200
What do we do, take it off?

585
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,500
People may I remind you

586
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,300
that technically it doesn't exist.

587
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,900
But he does exist.

588
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,400
Well, it has no
memory and no identity.

589
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,200
Oh, it's an it.

590
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,000
No, he is a human being,
and you're telling us

591
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,500
to work on him against his will.

592
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,300
What will?

593
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:46,600
Doctor, isn't this what you always wanted,

594
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,800
a living subject?

595
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,000
That's immoral, Colonel.

596
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,100
Morality has nothing to do with this.

597
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,100
Well, then what about these?

598
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
What about them?

599
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,300
The man was shot.

600
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:00,800
Send 'em to Washington.

601
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,900
See what they can come up with.

602
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,600
What good is that going to do?

603
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,000
Have 'em traced.

604
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:06,600
And then what?

605
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,200
So we'll know what happened.

606
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,100
How it died has nothing to do with this.

607
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,500
Human being, Colonel,

608
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,100
we're talking about a
human being in there.

609
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:15,900
Deal with it

610
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,800
and get on with the experiment.

611
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:25,500
Anything else?

612
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,700
No, sir.

613
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,800
He's a lyin' son of a bitch.

614
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,100
What happened?

615
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,500
What happened?

616
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,600
What happened?

617
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,600
What happened?

618
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,600
What happened?

619
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,850
Yeah?

620
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:21,170
- Hi.
- Hey.

621
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:23,670
I stopped by your apartment,
but you weren't there.

622
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:25,920
I just thought you might
like to have company.

623
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:26,760
Thanks.

624
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:29,160
It's the only place I feel
comfortable right now.

625
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,720
Are you okay?

626
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,040
Not really.

627
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,040
I'm questioning everything I believe in.

628
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,090
It just, it upsets me

629
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:36,990
that they're treating this so lightly.

630
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:38,940
You know, maybe everyone's just scared.

631
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:40,740
And they don't want to deal with it.

632
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:41,590
Hey, don't worry.

633
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:43,940
I've brought you something
to take the edge off.

634
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:45,040
That's not gonna help.

635
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,390
Hey, it'll help you unwind.

636
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:47,830
Here you go.

637
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:48,670
Thanks.

638
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:50,170
Remember when I told you about

639
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:51,620
that little girl they brought

640
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:53,220
into emergency, the burn victim?

641
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:55,120
You were interning at Lansing General.

642
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,320
She was seven years old.

643
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,020
90% of her body was scorched away.

644
00:43:58,020 --> 00:43:58,820
It was horrible.

645
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:00,770
And there was no way we could save her.

646
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:02,670
I can still see those pretty blue eyes

647
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:04,120
and the way she looked at me,

648
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,170
just before she died.

649
00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:06,970
Why are you thinking about that now?

650
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:08,820
When I watched her die, I, I thought,

651
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:10,320
what is it that left her body?

652
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,770
Something left when she died.

653
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:13,620
And now I have to think of the other,

654
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:14,720
the other possibility.

655
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,520
I don't get it.

656
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,520
What if nothing
leaves, if life is there,

657
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:19,920
locked in our cells forever,

658
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,120
and it can reassert
itself like it did today?

659
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,570
Something momentous happened.

660
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:24,620
But I don't know why.

661
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,500
Now that you've had time to
think things through a bit,

662
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:15,500
I'm sure there's been
an attitude adjustment.

663
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,000
Things have changed in the last 20 years.

664
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,500
Yes, you've been on ice for 20 years.

665
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:26,000
But now, I have things a
little more under control.

666
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:27,200
Oh.

667
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:33,700
I thought you might like to see this.

668
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,200
Huh?

669
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:38,100
Get away!

670
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,000
Hopefully, it will
help defrost your memory.

671
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,000
Unfortunately, you have
to go through all of this,

672
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:08,400
but as they say, no pain, no gain.

673
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,700
This new development will
give us the opportunity

674
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:16,900
to reach beyond even our original plan.

675
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Good to see you again, Donald.

676
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:03,500
Son of a bitch!

677
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,900
The skin is growing way too fast,

678
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:09,400
and it's getting hard.

679
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,600
I mean, I can't even get my needle in.

680
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:17,800
Let me try.

681
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:25,000
Isn't there another
place you could put that?

682
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,500
I don't have time to
think about it right now.

683
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,500
I don't know.

684
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,600
Colonel Miller has
something to do with this.

685
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,500
Now I know I did not hear you say that.

686
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:41,500
It was a fluke.

687
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:42,600
Even you said so.

688
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:43,600
Yes, I did.

689
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:44,700
But after watching him trying

690
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:46,400
to communicate with him, I'm not so sure.

691
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:47,700
I don't want to hear this.

692
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:49,200
Why didn't you go in

693
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,100
and ask him what he was doing?

694
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:51,300
I was alone.

695
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,100
Well, could you hear what he was saying?

696
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:57,500
Mm-mm, he was showing
him cards or pictures.

697
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:58,700
It looked like he was quizzing him,

698
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:01,100
like he was trying to jog his memory.

699
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:02,800
I...
- What about his memory?

700
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,300
Colonel Miller, good morning.

701
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:05,600
Good morning.

702
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:08,600
What's going on?

703
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:10,600
The pins are ready
to jump off the chart.

704
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:11,400
That's what's going on.

705
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:12,400
There's brain activity.

706
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:13,500
Are you sure?

707
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:15,100
Our machines don't lie, sir.

708
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,100
Colonel, this man belongs in a hospital.

709
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,400
The bio-ferrin is hardening.

710
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,700
Now there's a chance he'll
regain the use of his brain.

711
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:24,600
If that happens,

712
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:25,700
this whole thing turns into a nightmare.

713
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:28,300
We can't afford to
expose the program, Doctor.

714
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:28,700
What if he regains his memory?

715
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:31,800
I thought you said that wouldn't happen.

716
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,700
None of this was supposed to happen.

717
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:34,950
Damn!

718
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,400
We're not equipped for this.

719
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:45,200
Can't you do something about that?

720
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:46,200
Like what?

721
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:53,900
Larry, do we have
enough surgical tubing

722
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:54,700
to make a catheter?

723
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:56,700
No.

724
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:58,700
Oh no, no, no, no, no.

725
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:00,100
I'll quit before I touch him down there.

726
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:01,100
Let him piss all over the bed.

727
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:02,800
Larry, we have to control the water.

728
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,300
Mr Porter, I suggest
you get that tubing.

729
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:07,000
Please.

730
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,100
Is he feeling any pain?

731
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:20,200
If the baselines are correct,

732
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,200
yes, yes, he is in pain.

733
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:23,800
Well, can't you give him a painkiller?

734
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:26,100
I just gave him some Demerol.

735
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,600
It'll just take a little
bit of time to work.

736
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:30,100
Where are we, Roger?

737
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:32,100
We're on two.

738
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:51,500
What are you doing?

739
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:54,200
Come here.

740
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:55,500
Get this for me.

741
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:56,000
Do I have to?

742
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:57,100
- Roger.
- Okay, okay.

743
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:58,900
Hold that.

744
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:10,900
The FBI has blocked
the fingerprint scan.

745
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,000
They know who he is.

746
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,100
This is what I get when
enter Colonel Miller's name,

747
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:17,700
in effect, nothing.

748
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:21,000
It's the same thing.

749
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,200
There's too much secrecy
surrounding all this.

750
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:25,500
Will you make me a copy
of Miller's security key?

751
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:27,800
What? You're crazy.

752
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:29,500
Do you know what you're asking?

753
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:30,800
I need to find out who he is.

754
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:32,900
I could be involved in
something I shouldn't be doing.

755
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:34,500
I could lose my job.

756
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:36,900
I have to get into that
office, Debbie, please.

757
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:38,400
Please.

758
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,050
Okay.

759
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:43,900
But can we do it later?

760
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,200
You know, someone might walk in.

761
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:47,200
What about tonight?

762
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:50,100
- Fine.
- Thank you.

763
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:51,400
Meet me here at seven.

764
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:53,200
See you at seven.

765
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:48,500
Yes.

766
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:49,300
It's the lab.

767
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:49,500
No, don't touch that phone.

768
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:51,500
It's monitored with a time code.

769
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:53,500
I'll be through, in a minute.

770
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:40,700
Here you go.

771
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:43,100
What the hell?

772
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:44,800
You're kidding me.

773
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:46,900
Well, he can't just have disappeared.

774
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,900
I've got security turning
this place upside down.

775
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:50,200
As soon as I find out where he is,

776
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:51,100
you'll know about it.

777
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:53,900
Hope you know what you're doing.

778
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:55,560
So do I.

779
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:01,000
Get everyone into
the rec room immediately.

780
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:02,900
I've been paging Dr de Carlo.

781
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:04,300
I can't find her.

782
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:05,500
Where is she?

783
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:06,900
She shouldn't be out there running around

784
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:07,700
with this thing loose.

785
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:09,350
Here.

786
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:12,100
She isn't answering.

787
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:14,000
I don't know what's goin' on.

788
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Well, try her again.

789
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:23,500
Now either your agency is up to something,

790
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,100
or you're not dealing with a full deck.

791
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:28,500
May I suggest that you
clean up in here first?

792
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,200
And then review your security procedures.

793
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:26,000
Roger, Jesus, you scared me.

794
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:27,800
Thank God you're all right.

795
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,000
Why didn't you answer your pager?

796
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:30,900
I've been looking all over for you.

797
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,200
This section is quarantined.

798
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:33,200
For what?

799
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:35,000
What is going on?

800
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:40,000
He broke loose and killed Larry.

801
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:41,800
What?

802
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:43,800
Larry's dead.

803
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:47,800
General Hammond wants you
to come with me right away.

804
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:49,400
He's dead?

805
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:51,600
Wait, where's, where's Larry?

806
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:52,600
I have to see him.

807
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:53,600
See him, later, Doctor.

808
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:55,100
There's nothing you can do.

809
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:56,600
We have to get out of here.

810
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,200
It's much too dangerous.

811
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,500
But if he hits the fence,
he'll be electrocuted.

812
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,600
I don't care about the son of a bitch.

813
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:05,200
My priority is the safety of my people,

814
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:07,200
and if I find that bastard
first, I will kill him.

815
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,100
May I remind you, Leslie,

816
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:11,400
you have neither the
right nor the authority

817
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:13,300
to do that.

818
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:14,400
Bullshit!

819
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:16,000
We cleaned up the lab

820
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,200
and placed the body in the freezer room.

821
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:18,300
Good.

822
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:19,800
Colonel Miller has agreed to accompany you

823
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,000
on a tour of the grounds.

824
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,600
I want you to start here, go around,

825
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,000
and I will join you out front.

826
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:25,500
- Yes, sir.
- Gentlemen.

827
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:30,400
Corporal Turner, I
want you to start here,

828
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:32,900
conduct a search of the
building, sector by sector.

829
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,200
And when you're through,
we will meet you out here.

830
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:36,400
Yes, sir.

831
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:39,400
I want you to go to the metal shop,

832
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:41,400
see if you can put together something

833
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:42,500
to knock this thing out of commission.

834
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:44,900
And if he gets loose, I want him dead.

835
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:46,200
No problem.

836
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,200
Sector five, sector five.

837
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,500
Sector five clear.

838
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:07,100
Turner, are you there?

839
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,100
Nothin' out
here but a full moon.

840
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:33,600
Did you check the south gate?

841
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:34,600
What about across the lake?

842
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:46,100
Over here.

843
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:49,200
It's Corporal Turner, sir.

844
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:50,300
Oh my God.

845
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:53,600
God!
- He's over here, General!

846
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,100
- Get him!
- Don't hurt it!

847
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:55,700
You bastard!

848
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:56,700
Hit him with the CO2!

849
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:01,700
This is absolutely disgusting.

850
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,400
Everything is out of control.

851
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:05,700
Colonel, why don't you pack up and go back

852
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:07,000
to Langley with the rest of your spooks

853
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,600
and take this zombie with you?

854
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:09,800
Calm down, General.

855
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:11,400
This bio-ferrin was your invention.

856
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:12,900
All I did was merge the two.

857
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:13,900
What are you doing?

858
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:15,200
It's the same problem we had before.

859
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:16,600
The skin is too hard.

860
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:20,300
It's the only way we
can get the needle in.

861
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:22,200
As soon as he's sedated,
I want him out of here.

862
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:24,200
I've made arrangements
with the regional command.

863
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:25,700
They'll have him out of here,
first thing in the morning.

864
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:27,200
Good.

865
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,400
It's, it's not working.

866
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:29,800
It's, it's, we've got
to try something else.

867
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:31,500
Connect him to the rectifier.

868
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:32,700
Come on.

869
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:33,900
I'll be in my office.

870
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:38,100
Come on, Roger.

871
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:46,700
Standby.

872
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:49,400
Here you go.

873
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:55,900
Try to sedate
him, Doctor, not kill him.

874
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:57,900
We've tried everything else.

875
01:00:58,200 --> 01:00:59,400
We have to take this risk right now.

876
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:02,600
Where are you going?

877
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:03,600
To see Larry.

878
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:05,200
We need you here.

879
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:09,100
I'm going with you.

880
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:24,400
You sure you want to see him.

881
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:27,200
I mean, he's really messed up.

882
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:29,300
He's my friend.

883
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:35,800
Anna, if you need
me, I'll be in the lab.

884
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:02,000
Sorry.

885
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:03,900
Philip, what are you doing here?

886
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:06,000
I don't think you should see this.

887
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,800
I need to find out how he died.

888
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:11,000
All right, then I'll go with you.

889
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:12,000
No, I...

890
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:15,100
If you don't mind, I'd like
to do this alone, okay?

891
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:17,500
Okay?

892
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:23,700
- Okay.
- Thanks.

893
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:26,800
God!

894
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:54,700
Roger, what are you doing out here?

895
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:55,600
Waiting for you.

896
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:57,000
I don't think you should go in there.

897
01:03:58,200 --> 01:03:58,900
What's he doing?

898
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:00,800
Sleeping, but I don't know for how long.

899
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:04,100
I better just make
sure he doesn't wake up.

900
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:06,500
The bio-ferrin is covering him so fast

901
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:07,700
you can see it grow.

902
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:11,400
I got to think.

903
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:12,800
I just got to think.

904
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:15,900
I've got to think.

905
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:18,400
Don't do that.

906
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:20,900
I just came from Hammond's office.

907
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:23,000
He's fighting with Miller to
get that thing out of here.

908
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:25,100
I should've listened to my instincts.

909
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:27,000
None of this would've happened.

910
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Anna, it is nobody's fault.

911
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,000
We did what we were told.

912
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:30,400
Not one of us thought
it would come to this.

913
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,600
This isn't supposed to happen.

914
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:33,500
Yeah, well, you look in there,

915
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:34,700
and you tell me what
you see isn't happening.

916
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:36,500
He's turning into a wolf
or some kind of monster.

917
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:38,700
We have to kill him.

918
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:40,700
What are you talking about?

919
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:42,000
Moral responsibilities.

920
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:43,500
Do you realize what you're saying?

921
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:46,100
If he gets loose, he'll kill all of us.

922
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:47,600
Look at him.

923
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:48,700
In an hour, he's gonna be indestructible.

924
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:50,200
Now I need you to knock him out.

925
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:52,800
Where do we put the needle?

926
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:56,100
Stick it in his eye.

927
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:57,400
It's not gonna kill him.

928
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:58,400
When I get back, I'll finish, okay?

929
01:04:58,700 --> 01:05:00,300
Wait, wait, wait a
second, wait a second.

930
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:02,100
You're not gonna leave
me here alone, are you?

931
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,700
- Roger.
- Roger, just do it

932
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:06,500
and meet us back at my lab.

933
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:10,800
I'm just as frightened
as you are, all right?

934
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:12,600
Now inject the son of a bitch.

935
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:13,800
Where are you going?

936
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:14,700
I'm going to Miller's office

937
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:15,700
to get the silver bullets and a gun.

938
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:16,500
I'll be right back.

939
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:17,800
Silver won't penetrate the bio-ferrin.

940
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:20,200
We don't have a lot
of choices, right now.

941
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:21,100
That's our only chance.

942
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:28,900
I got another idea.

943
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,500
You stay cool.

944
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:33,400
I'm getting more silver.

945
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:45,400
Oh my God.

946
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:30,300
Are you sure this is going to work?

947
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:31,700
No.

948
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:34,300
But melting silver with the metal

949
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:35,600
from the bio-ferrin is our only chance.

950
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:37,300
If this sucker doesn't
kill him, nothing will.

951
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:38,900
General Hammond isn't
answering any of his pages.

952
01:09:38,900 --> 01:09:40,200
Well, we've got to find him

953
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:41,300
before Colonel Miller gets to him.

954
01:09:41,900 --> 01:09:42,800
If that thing breaks loose,

955
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:43,800
it'll destroy the entire community.

956
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:45,500
We're gonna have to shut this base down.

957
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:45,700
But then we'll be
trapped in here with him.

958
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:49,100
He'll kill all of us.

959
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:50,400
We don't have a choice.

960
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,600
Debbie.

961
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:54,100
What's the code?

962
01:09:56,700 --> 01:09:58,000
Come on!

963
01:09:58,900 --> 01:10:00,200
Look, I don't want to die, okay?

964
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:01,700
We're running out of time.

965
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:03,200
Now punch in that code

966
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:04,500
while we still have a
chance to blow him away.

967
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:15,500
All right.

968
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:18,600
Grab those shells and
let's go kill this bastard

969
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:19,700
before he kills us.

970
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:25,700
Easy, easy, easy.

971
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:27,600
Not so rough.

972
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:28,900
Sorry.

973
01:10:33,700 --> 01:10:34,600
You people in Washington

974
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:35,900
have absolutely no regard, not any.

975
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:38,000
What the hell do you
think you are, General?

976
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Aren't you a trained killer?

977
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:40,400
Oh my God!

978
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:41,900
He's ripped his throat out.

979
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:45,300
I'm trained to defend my country.

980
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:49,100
I don't know how the system
produces scum like you.

981
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:51,500
What system?

982
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:55,200
Ah, the old ways don't
exist anymore, General.

983
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:57,000
Here I am trying to make your job easier,

984
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,500
and all you do is resent me for it.

985
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:00,700
It's just so confusing, isn't it?

986
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:02,100
Bullshit!

987
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:04,200
What about this poor man?

988
01:11:04,900 --> 01:11:06,500
What am I supposed to say to his family?

989
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:07,900
What a waste!

990
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:09,300
Well, I don't think you're gonna have

991
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:11,100
to worry about that,
General, because you're

992
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:11,900
not going anywhere.

993
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:13,900
Stand up!

994
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:17,400
Oh, oh, oh, oh, don't even think of it.

995
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:18,800
Toss it over here.

996
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,500
And your walkie-talkie.

997
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:25,000
Ah, at my feet.

998
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:28,500
You're not gonna get
away with this, Colonel.

999
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:34,400
Why don't you hang around
here for a while, Leslie.

1000
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:36,200
I've got some work to do.

1001
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:40,900
Oh, don't wander too far.

1002
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:42,900
I hear it's dangerous out there.

1003
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:44,800
You son of a bitch!

1004
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:42,000
Hold it right there.

1005
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:43,800
Where's General Hammond?

1006
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:46,200
Well, let's just say
he's not jumping for joy.

1007
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:49,500
Oh, what are you going to do with that?

1008
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:52,200
These shells are the
only way we can stop him.

1009
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:53,900
Oh, I see.

1010
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:56,600
Forget it.

1011
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:58,800
No one's going to kill him.

1012
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:02,100
Now put the shells down

1013
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:04,300
and give me the launcher, hmm?

1014
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:18,800
Go, go!

1015
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:23,300
Get out of the way.

1016
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:30,500
Get out of the way.

1017
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:32,500
Over my dead body.

1018
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:51,600
Maybe he got Miller.

1019
01:13:52,300 --> 01:13:53,000
What do we do now?

1020
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:53,700
We've got to get out of here.

1021
01:13:53,700 --> 01:13:54,500
We've got to get help.

1022
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:00,300
This leads to the old institute.

1023
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,300
This door hasn't been opened in years.

1024
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:03,200
Where does it go?

1025
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:04,400
I haven't the slightest idea.

1026
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:05,700
Can you open it?

1027
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:08,800
I might be able to
bypass the encryption code.

1028
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:12,200
Oh shot, remember, remember.

1029
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:13,600
I'll try this.

1030
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:19,700
Hold on.

1031
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:22,000
Think, think, think, think, think.

1032
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:28,500
That's it.

1033
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:32,800
We got to get back to Philip.

1034
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:34,200
We can't leave him there like that.

1035
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:35,600
That's what he wants.

1036
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:36,500
You knows he'll do anything for you.

1037
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:38,800
Besides, he could still be alive.

1038
01:14:39,700 --> 01:14:40,600
Yeah, if we get to him in time.

1039
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:41,700
Come on.

1040
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:44,000
Wait, wait.

1041
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,500
Just in case we run into that thing.

1042
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:59,100
Very clever, girls.

1043
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:06,000
They said this
was destroyed by the fire.

1044
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:07,900
These chambers are so old,

1045
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:09,300
I can't believe they're still working.

1046
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:13,600
We've been
lied to, all these years.

1047
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:23,900
Those bastards have been using us.

1048
01:15:23,900 --> 01:15:24,100
What are you doing?

1049
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:27,700
- Getting rid of them.
- You can't do that.

1050
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:29,500
We need that to protect ourselves with.

1051
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:31,000
She's right.

1052
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,500
You know, you surprise me, Doctor.

1053
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:38,100
After all of your clinically
incisive, brilliant work,

1054
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:40,800
to see you so emotionally out of control,

1055
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:42,700
why, it just shatters
my whole image of you.

1056
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:45,300
It's unfortunate you had to stumble

1057
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:48,800
upon my little dormitory here.

1058
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:51,000
Where's Captain Ferraro?

1059
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:53,700
What men will do for love.

1060
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:56,400
You know I've never fully understood

1061
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:58,300
the concept of sacrifice.

1062
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:03,200
No, Donald, it's okay.

1063
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:04,100
It's me.

1064
01:16:05,300 --> 01:16:06,050
No!

1065
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:13,400
Donald!

1066
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:11,900
See if you can find a door down there.

1067
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:12,800
I'll look over here.

1068
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:13,900
Jesus, okay.

1069
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:46,600
Anna!

1070
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:49,500
Anna, I found a door that's open!

1071
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:52,050
Anna!

1072
01:17:58,600 --> 01:17:59,200
Anna!

1073
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:15,900
Shit.

1074
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:20,400
Debbie!

1075
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:21,300
Get down!

1076
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:33,700
Debbie!

1077
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:43,900
Debbie.

1078
01:22:40,700 --> 01:22:40,800
Come on!

1079
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:41,400
Anna, get out of the way!

1080
01:23:04,300 --> 01:23:04,900
It's empty.

1081
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:11,000
Hey, I have a shell, hurry!

1082
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:18,400
Go!

1083
01:23:58,300 --> 01:23:58,900
Let's see that.

1084
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:01,200
Let me see.

1085
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:03,400
I'm all right.

1086
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:05,700
What about you?

1087
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:07,400
Shaky.

1088
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:10,800
I'm sorry I couldn't get there sooner,

1089
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:14,200
but, I couldn't find you.

1090
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:15,900
Thank God you did.

1091
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:17,700
We thought you were dead.

1092
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:21,600
Oh there's bio-ferrin all over you.
