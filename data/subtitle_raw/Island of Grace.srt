1
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:20,732
Island of grace

2
00:01:30,486 --> 00:01:31,529
Mark's here.

3
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:44,315
Hey, Megan.

4
00:01:44,623 --> 00:01:45,441
Hi, Mark.

5
00:01:48,006 --> 00:01:50,169
Lucky.
He doesn't even know my name.

6
00:01:50,169 --> 00:01:50,789
You sure?

7
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:53,351
You find a way to slip it in
every time you see him.

8
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:57,020
Still, you have to work at it
to get noticed by the right guy.

9
00:01:57,314 --> 00:01:57,915
Megan.

10
00:01:58,852 --> 00:01:59,526
Later.

11
00:02:00,924 --> 00:02:02,503
Hey, are you okay?

12
00:02:02,503 --> 00:02:03,703
Yeah. Why?

13
00:02:03,703 --> 00:02:05,888
You weren't
at the Johnsons' last night

14
00:02:05,888 --> 00:02:06,885
for the service project.

15
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:08,290
Oh, that.

16
00:02:08,792 --> 00:02:10,655
I had plans with Kim
and some others.

17
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:13,728
I thought you were
in charge of it.

18
00:02:13,728 --> 00:02:16,328
I handed it off to someone else.
It went fine, right?

19
00:02:16,328 --> 00:02:18,130
No big deal.

20
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:19,321
What'd you do last night?

21
00:02:20,043 --> 00:02:21,319
We went to Pyro's.

22
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:22,252
The club.

23
00:02:23,546 --> 00:02:26,027
You went clubbing
on a Tuesday night?

24
00:02:26,384 --> 00:02:27,263
It's ladies' night.

25
00:02:41,772 --> 00:02:42,507
Yes?

26
00:02:42,507 --> 00:02:43,464
Mark?

27
00:02:43,464 --> 00:02:46,339
Your meeting with Mr. Davidson
is about to start.

28
00:02:47,245 --> 00:02:47,880
Thank you.

29
00:03:10,545 --> 00:03:11,751
What are you
doing here?

30
00:03:12,685 --> 00:03:14,152
Davidson asked him
to come.

31
00:03:16,874 --> 00:03:18,384
So, do you guys know
what this is all about?

32
00:03:18,384 --> 00:03:19,378
I have no idea.

33
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:23,057
Good.
We can start.

34
00:03:24,403 --> 00:03:27,536
Hansu Technologies
is licensing our C25 chip.

35
00:03:27,816 --> 00:03:29,232
That's the Chinese company,
right?

36
00:03:29,232 --> 00:03:31,428
This is gonna be used for
their new wireless media player.

37
00:03:31,428 --> 00:03:33,178
They're finally ready
to move forward on it.

38
00:03:33,178 --> 00:03:34,399
They're getting ready
to manufacture it

39
00:03:34,399 --> 00:03:36,965
at their Indonesia plant,
so I want you there.

40
00:03:36,965 --> 00:03:37,921
Great.

41
00:03:38,443 --> 00:03:40,187
You know this thing
inside and out,

42
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:43,558
so I need you to make sure
they don't change their minds.

43
00:03:43,558 --> 00:03:44,498
Done.

44
00:03:45,086 --> 00:03:47,571
And, uh, Megan.

45
00:03:47,571 --> 00:03:49,899
You'll be handling this account
as we move forward.

46
00:03:50,113 --> 00:03:51,251
Me?

47
00:03:51,674 --> 00:03:53,083
You excel
in your responsibilities.

48
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:54,757
You show great promise.

49
00:03:55,414 --> 00:03:57,713
Plus, Mark here thought
it might be a good fit.

50
00:03:57,713 --> 00:03:59,520
Thank you.

51
00:04:00,194 --> 00:04:03,290
Chris, you'll help with
the technical implementation.

52
00:04:03,521 --> 00:04:04,485
Yes, sir.

53
00:04:04,948 --> 00:04:06,043
Paul can't come?

54
00:04:06,253 --> 00:04:07,608
His wife is due any day.

55
00:04:07,608 --> 00:04:09,442
And I understand
Chris here speaks Chinese.

56
00:04:10,089 --> 00:04:10,852
I do.

57
00:04:12,003 --> 00:04:13,140
You speak Chinese?

58
00:04:15,259 --> 00:04:17,122
I thought we were
going to Indonesia.

59
00:04:17,383 --> 00:04:19,495
Most of their top executives
are Chinese.

60
00:04:19,495 --> 00:04:20,696
It could be useful.

61
00:04:20,696 --> 00:04:22,634
Check with Linda
for your travel arrangements.

62
00:04:22,913 --> 00:04:24,790
You leave tomorrow.
That's it.

63
00:04:25,038 --> 00:04:25,724
Thanks.

64
00:04:30,345 --> 00:04:31,366
It's just
a business trip.

65
00:04:31,366 --> 00:04:32,499
I know.

66
00:04:33,352 --> 00:04:34,737
So, what are you
so excited about?

67
00:04:34,737 --> 00:04:37,267
I'm finally getting somewhere.
Did you hear what he said?

68
00:04:37,267 --> 00:04:38,875
Yeah, that's
pretty flattering.

69
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,973
And I get to travel
and see the world.

70
00:04:40,973 --> 00:04:44,499
And spend some time with Mark Taylor.
- There is that.

71
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:47,458
I just heard. You get to
go somewhere with Mark.

72
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:49,108
How'd you hear so soon?
- Linda.

73
00:04:49,108 --> 00:04:50,439
So, it's just you
and Mark?

74
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:52,334
No.
Chris is going, too.

75
00:04:54,812 --> 00:04:55,371
Thanks.

76
00:04:56,684 --> 00:04:58,251
And it's just business.

77
00:04:58,251 --> 00:04:59,687
What are you
gonna wear?

78
00:04:59,687 --> 00:05:00,908
I have no idea.

79
00:05:01,159 --> 00:05:02,983
Oh, it's okay.
I'll come over after work.

80
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,734
Exciting meeting?

81
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:14,712
What?

82
00:05:15,592 --> 00:05:18,384
I get to go on a trip
with Mark Taylor.

83
00:05:18,624 --> 00:05:22,263
Wow. I know 15 women in this
office who would kill to be you.

84
00:05:22,263 --> 00:05:23,607
That's a first.

85
00:05:24,213 --> 00:05:25,636
You don't want to go?

86
00:05:25,636 --> 00:05:27,050
Would you?

87
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,712
He'll sweet-talk his way
past everyone,

88
00:05:28,931 --> 00:05:30,359
and then
double-cross them.

89
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,252
He took all the credit
for the work we did on the C25,

90
00:05:34,464 --> 00:05:36,904
and he got Brett fired
and moved us to the basement.

91
00:05:36,904 --> 00:05:38,545
You think he's changed?

92
00:05:40,096 --> 00:05:40,657
No.

93
00:05:41,275 --> 00:05:44,135
But I don't know.
Mark's going places.

94
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,630
He's already
upper management.

95
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,967
Pretty soon, he's going to be
chief something-or-other.

96
00:05:47,967 --> 00:05:50,838
Might not be a bad idea to let
it go, get on his good side.

97
00:05:50,838 --> 00:05:52,590
Why should I trust him?

98
00:05:53,825 --> 00:05:55,928
Do you really want to
back out of the trip?

99
00:05:56,971 --> 00:05:57,763
No.

100
00:06:00,231 --> 00:06:01,652
At least there's
an upside.

101
00:06:02,338 --> 00:06:03,840
Megan's going, too.

102
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,133
Really?

103
00:06:05,489 --> 00:06:06,719
Maybe you'll finally
ask her out.

104
00:06:08,042 --> 00:06:09,980
I'm just waiting
for the right moment.

105
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,881
Yeah. How's that working out
for you?

106
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:21,532
Mm, too tame.

107
00:06:28,141 --> 00:06:29,918
What?
Are you going to a funeral?

108
00:06:37,525 --> 00:06:38,373
Why not?

109
00:06:40,335 --> 00:06:41,050
Hang on.

110
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:42,845
Don't mind me.

111
00:06:45,559 --> 00:06:46,342
Hey, Chris.

112
00:06:46,342 --> 00:06:48,153
Hey.
Got your itinerary.

113
00:06:49,188 --> 00:06:50,925
Oh, I forgot
to pick it up.

114
00:06:50,925 --> 00:06:53,140
Linda came looking for you,
but you'd already left.

115
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,501
So I told her
I'd bring it by.

116
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,907
There's a commercial flight
to Malaysia,

117
00:06:57,373 --> 00:07:00,380
then some jet to,
uh, Kupang - Kupong.

118
00:07:00,591 --> 00:07:02,202
Thanks.

119
00:07:02,677 --> 00:07:04,388
You have your passport,
right?

120
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,047
Um...

121
00:07:07,475 --> 00:07:08,080
Hang on.

122
00:07:09,689 --> 00:07:11,535
You know,
I know I have one.

123
00:07:13,216 --> 00:07:14,142
That's good.

124
00:07:14,818 --> 00:07:15,905
Where is it?

125
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:18,887
So, how do you know
Chinese?

126
00:07:19,571 --> 00:07:21,877
I did a study-abroad thing
in college.

127
00:07:21,877 --> 00:07:24,189
Really?
That's a weird choice.

128
00:07:24,189 --> 00:07:27,467
1.5 billion Chinese people.
Smart choice.

129
00:07:27,957 --> 00:07:32,815
Well, I hope we can explore
a little while we're in, um...

130
00:07:32,815 --> 00:07:34,574
Indonesia.
Right.

131
00:07:35,292 --> 00:07:37,557
I don't know if we're gonna have
much time for fun on this trip.

132
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:40,039
Why not?
It's business.

133
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:43,182
A day to travel there, a day
back, two days of meetings,

134
00:07:43,182 --> 00:07:45,111
not to mention
the time difference.

135
00:07:45,111 --> 00:07:46,990
We'll make time for fun.

136
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:48,457
That'd be nice.

137
00:07:48,457 --> 00:07:49,702
You know, I -

138
00:07:51,244 --> 00:07:54,103
I don't get to see you
a whole lot outside of work.

139
00:07:54,103 --> 00:07:56,356
Uh, is that
your subtle way

140
00:07:56,356 --> 00:07:58,271
of bugging me
about going to church?

141
00:07:59,823 --> 00:08:00,841
Not really.

142
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,496
Well, i've been so busy...

143
00:08:04,074 --> 00:08:05,934
Hey, it's your life.

144
00:08:05,934 --> 00:08:06,726
Thank you.

145
00:08:07,869 --> 00:08:09,754
Doesn't mean I don't worry,
though.

146
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:12,003
Worry?
Chris, I -

147
00:08:12,293 --> 00:08:13,747
Oh, found it!

148
00:08:14,711 --> 00:08:15,592
Still valid?

149
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,761
Yes.

150
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,822
Shoes!
- Shoes!

151
00:08:23,311 --> 00:08:25,524
Well, I'll just leave you girls
to your shoes.

152
00:08:25,524 --> 00:08:27,894
Yeah.
Thanks for bringing that over.

153
00:08:29,068 --> 00:08:31,818
Gossiping about guys.

154
00:08:34,953 --> 00:08:36,317
Those kill my feet.

155
00:08:36,644 --> 00:08:38,298
But they look so sexy.

156
00:08:39,324 --> 00:08:41,028
So, what did Chris want?

157
00:08:41,028 --> 00:08:43,474
I forgot something at work,
so he brought it for me.

158
00:08:43,474 --> 00:08:45,727
That was nice of him.

159
00:08:45,727 --> 00:08:46,072
Yeah.

160
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:49,166
No. It's not like that.

161
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:50,585
We go to the same church.

162
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:53,944
Really? I didn't ever peg you
as the churchy type.

163
00:08:54,211 --> 00:08:57,665
Now, Chris, that actually
explains so much.

164
00:08:58,693 --> 00:08:59,800
A swimsuit.

165
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,047
I don't think
we'll be going swimming at all.

166
00:09:03,047 --> 00:09:04,743
Do you want
to risk that?

167
00:09:08,269 --> 00:09:10,258
don't you have a bikini?

168
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:12,640
Yeah, but I don't wear it
that much.

169
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,560
You do now.
Where is it?

170
00:09:19,427 --> 00:09:21,233
Much better.

171
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:24,370
You're so lucky.

172
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:26,553
Everyone at work
was talking about you today.

173
00:09:26,803 --> 00:09:28,327
Nothing nice, I bet.

174
00:09:28,327 --> 00:09:31,494
Oh, no, just gossip.
They're just jealous.

175
00:09:31,965 --> 00:09:33,662
Why?
Nothing's going to happen.

176
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:35,638
Besides,
Chris will be there.

177
00:09:35,638 --> 00:09:37,366
Everyone was worried
until they heard that.

178
00:09:37,366 --> 00:09:38,573
If it was just you
and Mark,

179
00:09:38,573 --> 00:09:41,447
you guys would probably end up
coming back an item.

180
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:42,509
I doubt it.

181
00:09:42,509 --> 00:09:45,941
And, besides,
he's always dating someone.

182
00:09:45,941 --> 00:09:48,114
Yeah, that someone
could be you.

183
00:10:00,758 --> 00:10:02,302
Morning.
- Hi.

184
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:05,190
Thank you.

185
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:05,953
Good morning.

186
00:10:05,953 --> 00:10:07,164
Hi, Mark.

187
00:10:07,616 --> 00:10:08,704
Nice bag.

188
00:10:08,704 --> 00:10:10,019
Megan's.

189
00:10:10,561 --> 00:10:12,371
You guys should get checked in.
I'll see you when we land.

190
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,887
You're not flying
with us?

191
00:10:14,576 --> 00:10:16,034
Yeah,
but I'm in first class.

192
00:10:16,518 --> 00:10:17,329
Of course you are.

193
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:45,030
Not bad.

194
00:10:46,407 --> 00:10:47,904
Should be better
than coach.

195
00:10:47,904 --> 00:10:49,386
Can't be worse.

196
00:10:53,313 --> 00:10:54,212
Hello?

197
00:10:56,268 --> 00:10:57,012
Hi, Jenna.

198
00:10:58,323 --> 00:10:59,326
Oh, here.

199
00:11:05,643 --> 00:11:07,224
Do you always
carry that?

200
00:11:08,192 --> 00:11:09,546
I'm a tech guy.

201
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:12,605
MacGyver.

202
00:11:14,318 --> 00:11:16,226
I had
a lot of fun, too.

203
00:11:16,754 --> 00:11:17,427
Well, sure.

204
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:20,720
I'm out of town right now,
but that'd be fun.

205
00:11:21,705 --> 00:11:23,080
No, no.

206
00:11:23,784 --> 00:11:25,000
I'll call you this time.

207
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,254
I promise.

208
00:11:26,913 --> 00:11:27,910
Okay.

209
00:11:29,005 --> 00:11:29,566
Sorry.

210
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,225
Girlfriend?

211
00:11:31,439 --> 00:11:32,625
No.
Just a date.

212
00:11:33,281 --> 00:11:35,186
It didn't work out?

213
00:11:35,436 --> 00:11:38,505
Well, I just prefer somebody
a little closer to my height.

214
00:11:39,219 --> 00:11:40,898
What?
Is she short?

215
00:11:41,553 --> 00:11:42,312
Yeah.

216
00:11:42,544 --> 00:11:44,035
She can't be
that short.

217
00:11:44,865 --> 00:11:46,092
Well,
when you look at her,

218
00:11:46,092 --> 00:11:48,437
you just assume she's further
away than she really is.

219
00:11:48,437 --> 00:11:50,568
When she's right next to you,
you just can't ignore it.

220
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:54,408
Look, don't judge me.
I don't really like dating.

221
00:11:54,408 --> 00:11:55,831
It's worth it
when you find someone,

222
00:11:56,361 --> 00:11:58,834
but, otherwise, it's just date
after date after date.

223
00:11:58,834 --> 00:12:00,232
Sounds real tough.

224
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,338
You know
what I'm talking about.

225
00:12:02,338 --> 00:12:03,704
Well...

226
00:12:03,704 --> 00:12:04,876
Or not.

227
00:12:05,815 --> 00:12:08,032
Come on.
It can't be that bad for you.

228
00:12:08,032 --> 00:12:11,311
You're probably breaking hearts
every weekend, aren't you?

229
00:12:11,515 --> 00:12:13,532
No, not really.

230
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:14,343
Come on.

231
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:18,910
This is going to be fun.

232
00:12:27,995 --> 00:12:29,285
Okay,
a few things to remember.

233
00:12:29,285 --> 00:12:32,192
Hansu Technologies needs us
just as bad as we need them,

234
00:12:32,192 --> 00:12:33,710
but don't let them
know that.

235
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:35,946
Be professional,
but keep the upper hand.

236
00:12:35,946 --> 00:12:37,846
And don't do anything
to mess this up.

237
00:12:39,097 --> 00:12:40,275
What's the scope
of the contract?

238
00:12:40,275 --> 00:12:43,472
Deal points on page 4.
We need to memorize these, okay?

239
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:45,347
I don't want any confusion
on our part.

240
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:48,980
There's some power issues with
this chip for what they need.

241
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:51,129
It might be better to have
a different configuration.

242
00:12:51,129 --> 00:12:53,101
Just tell them
what they need to hear, okay?

243
00:12:54,926 --> 00:12:56,084
What was that?

244
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:58,158
I think it was a bird.

245
00:13:01,241 --> 00:13:03,161
We're losing power.
Reduce speed.

246
00:13:03,161 --> 00:13:04,349
Is everything okay?

247
00:13:04,349 --> 00:13:06,454
Mr. Taylor, stay in your seat
and strap in.

248
00:13:08,466 --> 00:13:09,390
Well, what happened?

249
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:11,223
Left engine's failing.

250
00:13:14,895 --> 00:13:17,053
What's going on?
- Left engine's on fire!

251
00:13:17,053 --> 00:13:18,286
Pull the fire handle.

252
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:20,466
Are we going to be okay?

253
00:13:21,236 --> 00:13:23,414
We're losing fuel pressure
in the right engine.

254
00:13:23,414 --> 00:13:24,804
Switching frequencies.

255
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,634
Mayday, mayday, mayday.

256
00:13:26,634 --> 00:13:30,809
Control, this is a distress call
for Nancy 294 Tango Lima.

257
00:13:31,767 --> 00:13:33,658
Mayday, mayday, mayday.

258
00:13:33,658 --> 00:13:37,879
Nancy 294 Tango Lima has lost
power in its left engine.

259
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:40,475
Losing power in the right.
We're descending rapidly.

260
00:13:40,475 --> 00:13:43,002
Request
immediate assistance.

261
00:13:43,002 --> 00:13:44,601
We're still falling
too fast.

262
00:13:44,601 --> 00:13:49,867
Control, this is Nancy 294
Tango Lima, losing altitude.

263
00:13:49,867 --> 00:13:51,909
No one's answering.
Take over on radio.

264
00:13:51,909 --> 00:13:53,562
Mayday, mayday, mayday.

265
00:13:53,562 --> 00:13:57,269
Any ATC,
repeat, any Control Center.

266
00:13:57,269 --> 00:14:01,255
Nancy 294 Tango Lima
is losing altitude.

267
00:14:01,255 --> 00:14:02,598
We're drifting off course.

268
00:14:02,598 --> 00:14:03,864
We can't hold it.

269
00:14:03,864 --> 00:14:05,487
There's something ahead.

270
00:14:05,487 --> 00:14:07,475
Anywhere to land?
- Maybe.

271
00:14:08,952 --> 00:14:10,192
We're not going to make it.

272
00:14:10,192 --> 00:14:12,248
We're gonna try
a water landing.

273
00:14:12,248 --> 00:14:14,537
Nose up!
Mayday, mayday, mayday!

274
00:14:14,537 --> 00:14:17,447
Nancy 294 Tango Lima
is going down.

275
00:14:41,565 --> 00:14:42,557
Where's Megan?

276
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:44,759
Did you get the raft?

277
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,016
What?

278
00:14:46,016 --> 00:14:47,985
So we don't drown!

279
00:14:48,302 --> 00:14:49,739
What raft?

280
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:52,084
The plane had one,
didn't it?

281
00:14:52,084 --> 00:14:53,434
Megan!

282
00:14:54,038 --> 00:14:55,814
You should have
grabbed it!

283
00:14:55,814 --> 00:14:57,176
Help me find her.

284
00:15:04,961 --> 00:15:06,473
What about sharks?

285
00:15:11,042 --> 00:15:12,175
Megan!

286
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,175
Come here.
You're okay.

287
00:15:20,723 --> 00:15:22,211
Megan.

288
00:15:22,705 --> 00:15:23,991
Are you okay?

289
00:15:24,577 --> 00:15:25,719
Yeah.

290
00:15:28,058 --> 00:15:29,440
Over there!

291
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,990
It's not too far.
Think you can make it?

292
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,171
Where are the pilots?

293
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:22,784
I think
I'm going to be sick.

294
00:16:24,139 --> 00:16:28,006
It's okay, all right?
Just -

295
00:16:28,006 --> 00:16:29,742
Just breathe.

296
00:16:56,777 --> 00:16:57,948
Chris.

297
00:16:58,841 --> 00:17:00,094
Come here.

298
00:17:05,494 --> 00:17:06,791
What's this?

299
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:07,918
Cellphone.

300
00:17:09,911 --> 00:17:12,042
Do you think
we get reception out here?

301
00:17:12,042 --> 00:17:14,822
You're the tech guy.
Maybe it'll help.

302
00:17:17,758 --> 00:17:18,977
Are you hurt?

303
00:17:19,751 --> 00:17:21,607
My neck is stiff.

304
00:17:21,963 --> 00:17:23,932
He's stiff-necked.

305
00:17:23,932 --> 00:17:26,279
Where do you
think we are?

306
00:17:26,695 --> 00:17:28,327
Indonesia, I think.

307
00:17:28,327 --> 00:17:31,527
Where, though?
Were we even close to Kupang?

308
00:17:32,056 --> 00:17:34,085
All I know
is we're on an island.

309
00:17:34,085 --> 00:17:36,734
There's over 17,000 islands
in Indonesia.

310
00:17:36,734 --> 00:17:38,185
That doesn't
narrow it down.

311
00:17:38,185 --> 00:17:39,602
Great.

312
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:41,787
Seriously?

313
00:17:44,152 --> 00:17:44,935
Hello!

314
00:17:45,813 --> 00:17:46,667
What are you doing?

315
00:17:47,719 --> 00:17:49,765
I don't think
anybody heard you.

316
00:17:51,027 --> 00:17:53,104
Well, why don't we use
the cellphone?

317
00:17:53,104 --> 00:17:55,170
Hello?
Anyone out there?

318
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:57,478
There's nobody here.

319
00:17:57,717 --> 00:17:58,794
Not that we can see.

320
00:17:58,794 --> 00:18:00,389
The last thing we want
is thinking we're stranded,

321
00:18:00,389 --> 00:18:05,413
and there's actually a town
or resort half a mile away.

322
00:18:08,429 --> 00:18:11,037
Hello?
Is anybody there?

323
00:18:25,215 --> 00:18:27,423
I couldn't find anything
close-by.

324
00:18:28,013 --> 00:18:30,838
Maybe tomorrow
we can search some more.

325
00:18:31,989 --> 00:18:34,881
Plus, we need to find
some water.

326
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:36,840
I could use some
right now.

327
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,154
Yeah.

328
00:18:38,464 --> 00:18:40,417
It's getting
kind of dark.

329
00:18:40,417 --> 00:18:42,324
We'll have to wait
till morning.

330
00:18:42,324 --> 00:18:45,044
With any luck, someone
will have come for us by then.

331
00:18:45,044 --> 00:18:47,473
Yeah, someone had
our flight plan, right?

332
00:18:47,473 --> 00:18:49,805
What about
the black box?

333
00:18:49,805 --> 00:18:53,149
Actually, that's for
when they find the wreckage.

334
00:18:54,588 --> 00:18:56,570
But someone had to notice,
right?

335
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:57,819
Of course.

336
00:18:57,819 --> 00:18:59,994
I'm sure someone noticed
when we went off radar.

337
00:18:59,994 --> 00:19:02,325
Plus, they're expecting us
to land.

338
00:19:02,325 --> 00:19:06,198
Between those two things,
they'll be looking.

339
00:19:39,556 --> 00:19:41,151
I'm ready to go home.

340
00:19:59,767 --> 00:20:03,534
Uh. Rocks don't make
good pillows.

341
00:20:04,006 --> 00:20:05,059
You sore?

342
00:20:05,059 --> 00:20:07,310
It's just my back.

343
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,334
Come here.

344
00:20:10,063 --> 00:20:12,687
Oh, yeah.
Right there.

345
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:29,491
Hey, do you guys see that?

346
00:20:42,267 --> 00:20:44,363
Mark:
Chris, go check it out.

347
00:20:51,271 --> 00:20:52,322
You're not coming?

348
00:20:52,322 --> 00:20:55,953
Dude, these shoes have
no traction.

349
00:20:57,852 --> 00:20:59,637
Be careful.

350
00:21:15,658 --> 00:21:16,742
Thirsty?

351
00:21:17,661 --> 00:21:19,290
Is that even good?

352
00:21:24,872 --> 00:21:26,070
Yep.

353
00:21:40,584 --> 00:21:41,346
Hey, Mark!

354
00:21:42,224 --> 00:21:43,477
What is it?

355
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:47,310
My bag!

356
00:21:53,634 --> 00:21:55,817
I don't suppose
mine made it.

357
00:21:55,817 --> 00:21:56,978
That brick?

358
00:21:56,978 --> 00:21:59,303
That's at the bottom
of the ocean.

359
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:04,642
Here.
You want to take this back?

360
00:22:11,158 --> 00:22:13,042
What is it?

361
00:22:15,228 --> 00:22:16,999
It's one of the pilots.

362
00:22:18,494 --> 00:22:21,445
Why don't you take that bag
and see what we can use?

363
00:22:21,445 --> 00:22:23,037
Mark, give me a hand.

364
00:22:23,037 --> 00:22:24,880
With that?

365
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,227
Him. Yes.

366
00:22:27,227 --> 00:22:28,809
Well, he's dead.

367
00:22:28,809 --> 00:22:31,021
We can't
leave him here.

368
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:32,599
Why not?

369
00:22:33,283 --> 00:22:34,225
Remember the tide?

370
00:22:34,225 --> 00:22:37,663
Do you want him washing up
in the middle of the night?

371
00:22:39,561 --> 00:22:40,987
Better to lay him
to rest.

372
00:23:42,099 --> 00:23:44,980
Thanks for all you did.

373
00:23:46,938 --> 00:23:47,705
I'm so thirsty.

374
00:23:47,705 --> 00:23:49,663
We should have had something
ready to drink.

375
00:23:49,663 --> 00:23:53,682
Hey, you had some orange juice.
Besides, that needed to be done.

376
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:54,441
Fine.
It's done.

377
00:23:54,441 --> 00:23:57,034
Now we should seriously
think about getting some water.

378
00:23:57,034 --> 00:23:59,318
I'm all for it.

379
00:23:59,318 --> 00:24:01,533
We can use these
and refill them.

380
00:24:02,647 --> 00:24:04,946
And I can finally get
out of this shirt.

381
00:24:15,098 --> 00:24:16,087
What?

382
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:18,144
Wasn't me.

383
00:24:18,628 --> 00:24:20,876
Hey, can I use these?

384
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,203
Sure.

385
00:24:22,511 --> 00:24:24,669
I can fix those.

386
00:24:24,669 --> 00:24:26,286
Oh, thanks.

387
00:24:34,642 --> 00:24:35,649
There you go.

388
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:36,962
Thanks.

389
00:24:56,416 --> 00:24:59,082
I'll buy you a new pair of jeans
when we get back.

390
00:24:59,082 --> 00:25:00,378
Don't worry about it.

391
00:25:00,378 --> 00:25:01,766
They look a little loose.

392
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:04,831
I'm glad, 'cause if we were
the same size...

393
00:25:07,493 --> 00:25:09,986
Here. Try this.

394
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:15,593
Sorry.
You get the idea.

395
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:21,020
Not bad.

396
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:28,476
Let's go.

397
00:25:28,923 --> 00:25:30,753
I'm not sure
we should all go.

398
00:25:30,753 --> 00:25:32,207
What do you mean?

399
00:25:32,207 --> 00:25:33,563
What if a rescue comes?

400
00:25:33,563 --> 00:25:36,405
If we're in the middle of
the island, they can't find us.

401
00:25:36,405 --> 00:25:39,209
You really think they're
gonna find us that quickly?

402
00:25:39,209 --> 00:25:42,210
I'm a V.P. in the company.
Of course they'll come.

403
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:43,722
All right,
you can stay.

404
00:25:43,722 --> 00:25:45,371
But it's gonna be awhile
before we find water

405
00:25:45,371 --> 00:25:47,848
and bring it back
to you.

406
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,818
Plus, if we're lucky,
we'll find some food.

407
00:25:55,703 --> 00:25:57,021
Okay.

408
00:26:06,311 --> 00:26:08,308
I could really go for a burger
right now.

409
00:26:09,577 --> 00:26:11,912
Or a nice cut
of filet mignon.

410
00:26:12,229 --> 00:26:14,000
I'm up for any food.

411
00:26:14,456 --> 00:26:16,475
There's always that.

412
00:26:17,025 --> 00:26:18,733
I'm not that hungry.

413
00:26:21,688 --> 00:26:24,244
Hey, can you guys
wait a minute?

414
00:26:24,475 --> 00:26:25,724
What's wrong?

415
00:26:25,724 --> 00:26:27,336
Nothing.

416
00:26:28,662 --> 00:26:29,821
Where are you going?

417
00:26:33,447 --> 00:26:34,748
Nature's calling.

418
00:26:36,752 --> 00:26:37,854
Be careful.

419
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,944
So, how do you
know Megan?

420
00:26:41,292 --> 00:26:43,417
Aside from work?

421
00:26:43,726 --> 00:26:44,430
Yeah.

422
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:46,711
We go to the same church.

423
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:47,878
Really?

424
00:26:49,335 --> 00:26:52,894
So, she's like
a religious type?

425
00:26:54,494 --> 00:26:55,883
I was talking.

426
00:26:57,208 --> 00:26:58,544
Mark, catch.

427
00:27:08,281 --> 00:27:10,633
There you are.
Fruit?

428
00:27:10,633 --> 00:27:12,592
No bugs.

429
00:27:16,305 --> 00:27:18,728
Hey, look what Mark
got us.

430
00:27:26,599 --> 00:27:29,415
Well, if we don't find water,
we can make juice.

431
00:27:29,415 --> 00:27:32,205
We should also see
what else we can find to eat.

432
00:27:32,205 --> 00:27:34,397
There's always fish.
Gross.

433
00:27:34,743 --> 00:27:35,602
What?

434
00:27:35,602 --> 00:27:37,786
I don't like seafood.

435
00:27:37,786 --> 00:27:40,149
I don't think you're gonna find
a cow on the island.

436
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,120
I can dream.

437
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,896
Do we even know
where we're going?

438
00:27:43,494 --> 00:27:44,855
Not really.

439
00:27:44,855 --> 00:27:47,014
So, we could be walking
in circles.

440
00:27:47,014 --> 00:27:49,661
Who knows? I left the map
back at the beach.

441
00:27:50,086 --> 00:27:51,455
Great.

442
00:27:51,455 --> 00:27:54,038
We are doomed.

443
00:27:56,165 --> 00:27:57,353
Hey, if you think
you can do better...

444
00:27:57,353 --> 00:27:59,498
I don't think.
I know.

445
00:27:59,826 --> 00:28:01,601
Megan: Guys.
- Lead the way.

446
00:28:01,601 --> 00:28:03,978
Do you hear that?
I will.

447
00:28:03,978 --> 00:28:06,259
They're just birds.

448
00:28:09,064 --> 00:28:11,665
Those aren't birds.

449
00:28:14,229 --> 00:28:16,191
Bats! Go!

450
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:21,657
Bats! Bats!

451
00:28:21,657 --> 00:28:22,428
Bats!

452
00:28:23,423 --> 00:28:26,216
Get away! Get away!

453
00:28:28,435 --> 00:28:29,687
Water!

454
00:28:30,405 --> 00:28:31,159
Water!

455
00:28:44,251 --> 00:28:45,743
You screamed
like a girl.

456
00:28:45,743 --> 00:28:47,326
I am a girl!

457
00:28:47,326 --> 00:28:48,884
I was talking about Mark.

458
00:28:56,062 --> 00:28:59,251
I hope Hansu Technologies
doesn't back out.

459
00:28:59,251 --> 00:29:00,749
Seriously?

460
00:29:00,749 --> 00:29:02,878
That's what
you're hoping for?

461
00:29:03,186 --> 00:29:04,681
Well, word is gonna reach
our competitors.

462
00:29:04,681 --> 00:29:07,597
I don't want to lose the deal
'cause we took too long.

463
00:29:07,597 --> 00:29:10,062
I think we have
bigger problems.

464
00:29:13,022 --> 00:29:16,363
It's hard to think of work
when we're here.

465
00:29:16,363 --> 00:29:18,717
You're right.

466
00:29:18,717 --> 00:29:21,005
Chris told me something
that caught me off guard.

467
00:29:21,265 --> 00:29:22,269
What?

468
00:29:23,265 --> 00:29:25,025
Church?

469
00:29:26,269 --> 00:29:28,561
He told you about that?

470
00:29:29,487 --> 00:29:31,253
It's cute.

471
00:29:31,456 --> 00:29:33,270
Sure, it is.

472
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:35,271
I've never heard
that one before.

473
00:29:35,271 --> 00:29:37,878
I've never known
any church patrons,

474
00:29:37,878 --> 00:29:39,373
or whatever you call them.

475
00:29:39,373 --> 00:29:40,873
I don't know
that I'm a...

476
00:29:40,873 --> 00:29:43,987
it's just church.

477
00:29:44,316 --> 00:29:45,160
What's that?

478
00:29:46,208 --> 00:29:48,763
We were just talking about
how you two know each other.

479
00:29:51,267 --> 00:29:53,898
We should start
to get back.

480
00:29:54,941 --> 00:29:56,834
Why did you tell him?

481
00:29:56,834 --> 00:29:57,781
What?

482
00:29:57,781 --> 00:30:00,424
You told him
about church.

483
00:30:00,625 --> 00:30:01,563
Yeah, so?

484
00:30:01,563 --> 00:30:04,081
You don't tell anyone
about that.

485
00:30:04,081 --> 00:30:05,492
Why not?
It's a part of you.

486
00:30:05,492 --> 00:30:07,600
No.
I mean, yes, but...

487
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,288
What?
Are you ashamed of it?

488
00:30:09,288 --> 00:30:10,414
No.
I'm sorry.

489
00:30:10,414 --> 00:30:14,291
I don't broadcast it
like you do.

490
00:30:14,689 --> 00:30:16,325
I'm tired of standing out.

491
00:30:17,096 --> 00:30:18,579
It's not that easy
for me.

492
00:30:19,571 --> 00:30:21,839
It might not be, but that's
kind of the point, isn't it?

493
00:30:22,243 --> 00:30:23,112
Sure, you say that.

494
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,396
Your full name
is Christian Russell.

495
00:30:24,396 --> 00:30:26,735
you have religian ingrained
 since you where born.

496
00:30:38,249 --> 00:30:39,171
Thank you.

497
00:30:41,634 --> 00:30:43,072
Have you heard?
- It's awful.

498
00:30:43,072 --> 00:30:43,922
What?

499
00:30:43,922 --> 00:30:45,900
The charter plane
went down yesterday.

500
00:30:46,197 --> 00:30:47,197
What plane?

501
00:30:47,197 --> 00:30:49,073
The plane with Mark, Megan,
and Chris.

502
00:30:49,073 --> 00:30:51,482
Nobody knows where it is
or if anyone even survived.

503
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:54,446
They're searching for them,
and nobody's heard anything yet.

504
00:30:55,167 --> 00:30:56,324
They crashed?

505
00:31:08,872 --> 00:31:10,810
You really think
this is gonna work?

506
00:31:11,123 --> 00:31:13,419
I figure
it's worth a shot.

507
00:31:14,453 --> 00:31:16,143
I'm open
to suggestions.

508
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:19,437
I say we keep somebody
on the beach at all times.

509
00:31:20,124 --> 00:31:22,392
What?
To flag them down?

510
00:31:22,392 --> 00:31:24,624
If they're looking for us,
why not?

511
00:31:24,624 --> 00:31:27,498
The beach would be
the easiest place to find us.

512
00:31:28,643 --> 00:31:31,608
Doesn't hurt.
The more we try, the better.

513
00:31:34,547 --> 00:31:37,033
What about a fire?

514
00:31:52,898 --> 00:31:55,166
Okay, so,
if we see anything come by,

515
00:31:55,166 --> 00:31:57,011
we light
the signal fire.

516
00:31:57,011 --> 00:31:59,031
Do you think the tide
will be a problem?

517
00:31:59,031 --> 00:32:00,854
We're far enough away
from the water.

518
00:32:00,854 --> 00:32:02,374
It should be fine.

519
00:32:03,674 --> 00:32:06,830
We should probably build
a shelter tomorrow.

520
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:10,184
You really think we're
going to be here awhile.

521
00:32:13,072 --> 00:32:16,875
I'd rather be ready for it
than not.

522
00:32:22,542 --> 00:32:27,629
You know, I hate to admit it,
but he's probably right.

523
00:32:52,925 --> 00:32:55,445
I was thinking for a roof.
What do you think?

524
00:32:55,445 --> 00:32:56,503
Sure.

525
00:33:04,481 --> 00:33:07,183
No.
Put it up here.

526
00:33:08,091 --> 00:33:09,355
Fine.

527
00:33:10,913 --> 00:33:13,085
No.
This way.

528
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:17,050
Be my guest.

529
00:33:18,492 --> 00:33:20,184
What's your problem?

530
00:33:21,697 --> 00:33:22,967
My problem?

531
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:25,523
Yeah. I'm not blind.
You got a problem, just tell me.

532
00:33:25,523 --> 00:33:28,082
That is so Mark Taylor.

533
00:33:27,545 --> 00:33:28,602
What?

534
00:33:34,125 --> 00:33:35,718
You don't know
what you're doing.

535
00:33:35,949 --> 00:33:37,221
You don't do anything.

536
00:33:37,221 --> 00:33:40,357
You just sweet-talk everyone,
flash your little smile,

537
00:33:40,357 --> 00:33:42,095
And take credit
for their work.

538
00:33:42,095 --> 00:33:43,533
Are you still
hung up on that?

539
00:33:43,533 --> 00:33:44,596
You got where you are
because -

540
00:33:44,596 --> 00:33:46,991
I got where I am
because I work hard.

541
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:50,996
I may not be the hands-on guy,
but I know what I'm doing.

542
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,932
You sure do.

543
00:34:04,777 --> 00:34:06,209
What are you doing?

544
00:34:06,209 --> 00:34:09,050
Seeing if there's anything
we might have missed.

545
00:34:09,503 --> 00:34:10,921
Did you find anything?

546
00:34:10,921 --> 00:34:12,600
Nope.

547
00:34:15,447 --> 00:34:17,755
I knew there was a raft!

548
00:34:20,656 --> 00:34:22,765
You doing okay
with all this?

549
00:34:22,765 --> 00:34:24,485
Yeah.

550
00:34:27,327 --> 00:34:29,856
You're handling this better
than I thought you would.

551
00:34:30,173 --> 00:34:31,817
The crash?

552
00:34:32,473 --> 00:34:35,217
I thought you'd be like
every other woman in the office,

553
00:34:35,217 --> 00:34:38,804
who, let's face it,
would be freaking out.

554
00:34:38,804 --> 00:34:40,957
Then again, they'd be
completely awestruck

555
00:34:40,957 --> 00:34:43,680
by you being here.

556
00:34:46,466 --> 00:34:49,091
You know,
I kind of get tired of all that.

557
00:34:49,091 --> 00:34:50,990
You do?

558
00:34:51,424 --> 00:34:54,553
Yeah, it's every guy's fantasy
to be chased by women, but

559
00:34:54,553 --> 00:34:58,113
everyone seems to put me
on this pedestal.

560
00:34:58,113 --> 00:35:00,678
They don't see
the real me.

561
00:35:01,253 --> 00:35:05,399
Is the real you better
or worse?

562
00:35:05,284 --> 00:35:06,157
Both.

563
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:09,875
At least you're honest.

564
00:35:09,875 --> 00:35:11,472
Well,
I'm not perfect, but

565
00:35:11,472 --> 00:35:13,253
 there's more to me
than just...

566
00:35:13,253 --> 00:35:15,819
money, success,
good looks?

567
00:35:15,819 --> 00:35:18,694
Sure,
point them all out.

568
00:35:18,694 --> 00:35:21,776
But that's exactly
what people see first.

569
00:35:21,776 --> 00:35:23,605
So, what's the cure?

570
00:35:23,605 --> 00:35:25,554
Give away the money?
Fail?

571
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:28,473
Smear a little mud
on your face?

572
00:35:29,022 --> 00:35:30,171
No.

573
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:34,785
Just find someone
who can see more than that.

574
00:35:41,196 --> 00:35:42,499
We should get back.

575
00:35:42,499 --> 00:35:44,256
Make sure Chris hasn't
torn apart the shelter

576
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,704
and built a computer.

577
00:35:55,399 --> 00:35:58,429
Are you
putting on cologne?

578
00:35:58,429 --> 00:36:03,253
The benefits of having
your stuff wash up.

579
00:36:03,253 --> 00:36:04,628
Do you mind?

580
00:36:05,083 --> 00:36:07,070
What are you doing?

581
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:10,519
I'm seeing what we have
in case we can use it.

582
00:36:11,775 --> 00:36:14,072
That's not whipped cream.

583
00:36:14,072 --> 00:36:15,633
Thanks.

584
00:36:15,633 --> 00:36:17,333
How would it help?

585
00:36:17,333 --> 00:36:18,626
Not sure yet.

586
00:36:18,626 --> 00:36:20,072
I know fruit is healthy,

587
00:36:20,072 --> 00:36:22,947
but a little variety
would be really nice.

588
00:36:25,381 --> 00:36:30,457
Hey, Chris,
can I borrow your knife?

589
00:36:46,801 --> 00:36:48,609
I thought
you hated fish.

590
00:36:48,609 --> 00:36:52,099
At this point,
I'm willing to give it a try.

591
00:36:52,883 --> 00:36:54,298
Can I help?

592
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,817
Please.

593
00:36:55,817 --> 00:36:58,631
I don't even think
I was close.

594
00:37:06,505 --> 00:37:07,848
Are you sure
this even works?

595
00:37:07,848 --> 00:37:09,299
Nope.

596
00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:13,942
Hurry! Hurry!
Right there! Right there! Right there!

597
00:37:18,637 --> 00:37:19,628
Great.

598
00:37:43,922 --> 00:37:46,396
Wait.
I think I got it!

599
00:37:46,396 --> 00:37:48,174
Flammable.

600
00:37:49,655 --> 00:37:51,123
Yeah!

601
00:37:54,371 --> 00:37:55,727
You got one!

602
00:38:00,335 --> 00:38:02,485
Hey,
look what we got.

603
00:38:05,108 --> 00:38:06,421
Now what?

604
00:38:08,166 --> 00:38:09,483
We gut it.

605
00:38:11,078 --> 00:38:12,032
Really?

606
00:38:12,311 --> 00:38:15,526
Well, I'm going to go see
what else I can find.

607
00:38:15,526 --> 00:38:17,719
I'll be back in a while.

608
00:38:20,733 --> 00:38:23,852
I'm gonna go with you.

609
00:38:23,852 --> 00:38:25,980
Mark,
you've got the signal fire?

610
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:27,791
You guys don't want fish?

611
00:38:27,791 --> 00:38:29,449
I'm okay.

612
00:38:30,035 --> 00:38:32,726
I'll just put it
on ice, then.

613
00:38:37,892 --> 00:38:39,088
I can still smell it.

614
00:38:39,512 --> 00:38:40,668
The fish?

615
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:43,813
I'm going to go out
on a limb.

616
00:38:43,813 --> 00:38:45,398
That you don't like sushi,
either.

617
00:38:45,398 --> 00:38:46,528
Nope.

618
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:48,857
Can't get past
the seaweed stuff.

619
00:38:48,857 --> 00:38:50,827
It's not the fish
that bothers you?

620
00:38:50,827 --> 00:38:53,422
Yeah, I don't know.
I never got that far.

621
00:38:55,343 --> 00:38:56,415
What was that?

622
00:38:58,996 --> 00:39:00,542
Manna from heaven.

623
00:39:05,233 --> 00:39:06,607
What are you doing?

624
00:39:07,336 --> 00:39:08,431
Don't you want one?

625
00:39:08,768 --> 00:39:09,930
Well, yeah, but...

626
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:11,607
I'll just climb up there.

627
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:13,649
Are you sure
you can get up there?

628
00:39:15,123 --> 00:39:16,070
I got it.

629
00:39:16,379 --> 00:39:17,366
I'm sure.

630
00:39:17,848 --> 00:39:19,353
Just watch.

631
00:39:25,024 --> 00:39:26,072
Nice.

632
00:39:27,368 --> 00:39:28,306
Just watch.

633
00:39:34,096 --> 00:39:35,261
Are you all right?

634
00:39:37,507 --> 00:39:43,651
Okay, so, maybe I need to
rethink this.

635
00:39:51,904 --> 00:39:52,984
Okay. Better.

636
00:40:01,168 --> 00:40:03,214
Okay,
now I'm impressed.

637
00:40:20,354 --> 00:40:21,960
Nice work.

638
00:40:22,259 --> 00:40:23,014
Well...

639
00:40:24,214 --> 00:40:25,327
Megan.

640
00:40:27,527 --> 00:40:28,858
Do you see that?

641
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:30,613
A boat!

642
00:40:31,423 --> 00:40:32,649
Mark!

643
00:40:36,804 --> 00:40:37,865
Mark!

644
00:40:37,865 --> 00:40:38,811
Mark, light the signal!

645
00:40:40,987 --> 00:40:42,473
Mark, light the signal!

646
00:40:42,994 --> 00:40:43,864
A boat!

647
00:40:44,474 --> 00:40:45,819
What boat?

648
00:40:52,595 --> 00:40:55,601
Hurry up, man!
Hurry up!

649
00:40:58,386 --> 00:41:00,569
You're trying to light
a big log.

650
00:41:00,569 --> 00:41:01,737
Get the little stuff.

651
00:41:01,737 --> 00:41:03,988
What were you doing?
The boat was right there.

652
00:41:03,988 --> 00:41:05,975
You couldn't light it
fast enough!

653
00:41:05,975 --> 00:41:07,674
I wouldn't have to
if you'd been awake!

654
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:09,316
Where's the boat?

655
00:41:09,316 --> 00:41:10,882
You really think
this is going to work?

656
00:41:10,882 --> 00:41:12,638
Those ships are miles out.

657
00:41:12,638 --> 00:41:15,175
The whole island would have to
be on fire for them to notice.

658
00:41:15,521 --> 00:41:16,485
You are so...

659
00:41:16,485 --> 00:41:18,188
What?

660
00:41:25,732 --> 00:41:26,797
You're right.

661
00:41:28,196 --> 00:41:29,991
We need
a better solution.

662
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,295
That looks good.

663
00:41:40,968 --> 00:41:42,360
If we had some black pepper
and some lemon,

664
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,545
this would be
first-class.

665
00:41:44,831 --> 00:41:45,968
You cook?

666
00:41:47,445 --> 00:41:49,325
Don't tell the girls
in the office.

667
00:41:49,577 --> 00:41:51,004
It's our secret.

668
00:41:51,624 --> 00:41:52,859
Shut up.

669
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:55,317
How do you open this?

670
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,365
Here. I'll do it.

671
00:42:00,424 --> 00:42:04,721
Where is my knife?

672
00:42:07,101 --> 00:42:08,596
Thanks.

673
00:42:34,102 --> 00:42:35,662
What about a flare?

674
00:42:35,662 --> 00:42:36,976
What?

675
00:42:38,069 --> 00:42:40,166
For a way
to signal help.

676
00:42:40,166 --> 00:42:42,923
Unless a flare gun washes up,
we're out of luck.

677
00:42:43,192 --> 00:42:43,938
No, but we have...

678
00:42:43,938 --> 00:42:45,267
You keep thinking.

679
00:42:45,267 --> 00:42:46,563
I'm hungry.

680
00:42:47,589 --> 00:42:49,320
And dinner is served.

681
00:42:49,507 --> 00:42:50,756
Uau!

682
00:42:51,506 --> 00:42:53,800
I thought
you didn't like fish.

683
00:42:54,827 --> 00:42:56,467
It can't be that bad.

684
00:42:58,472 --> 00:43:00,899
Should we bless it?

685
00:43:02,405 --> 00:43:04,110
Mark,
do you mind if we...

686
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:06,660
Chris, we don't need to.

687
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:08,766
Go ahead.

688
00:43:10,195 --> 00:43:11,549
Do you want to say it?

689
00:43:11,549 --> 00:43:12,299
No.

690
00:43:17,947 --> 00:43:21,256
John.
Watch it.

691
00:43:21,256 --> 00:43:22,714
Sorry.

692
00:43:24,452 --> 00:43:25,675
Are you okay?

693
00:43:26,149 --> 00:43:27,095
I'm fine.

694
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,276
Everyone's fine,
apparently.

695
00:43:29,769 --> 00:43:31,101
Nobody's
heard anything more yet.

696
00:43:31,101 --> 00:43:34,001
Until we do, we just have to
hope they're all okay.

697
00:43:34,001 --> 00:43:36,550
I thought all the women would
still be crying over Mark.

698
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:39,028
You have not been to
the women's bathroom recently.

699
00:43:39,028 --> 00:43:40,631
No, I haven't.

700
00:43:40,879 --> 00:43:42,124
Look, you're not alone.

701
00:43:42,124 --> 00:43:44,021
I can't believe
how excited I was for Megan.

702
00:43:44,021 --> 00:43:47,548
A chance to go on a trip,
with Mark and all.

703
00:43:47,548 --> 00:43:49,041
And now...

704
00:43:50,162 --> 00:43:52,629
What if it had been me?

705
00:43:54,023 --> 00:43:56,346
That's what
you're worried about? You?

706
00:43:56,346 --> 00:43:57,634
No, it's not -

707
00:43:57,634 --> 00:44:00,485
They could be treading water
right now.

708
00:44:00,485 --> 00:44:02,196
There could be sharks nipping
at their legs.

709
00:44:02,196 --> 00:44:04,370
They could already be...

710
00:44:06,243 --> 00:44:09,377
I hope Megan's okay.
I hope they're all okay.

711
00:44:09,377 --> 00:44:13,540
Hey, if they're alive,
Chris will take care of Megan.

712
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:15,113
You think so?

713
00:44:15,507 --> 00:44:16,711
I know so.

714
00:44:18,061 --> 00:44:19,602
Does Chris like Megan?

715
00:44:19,602 --> 00:44:20,807
I didn't say that.

716
00:44:20,807 --> 00:44:22,479
So, he doesn't.

717
00:44:23,058 --> 00:44:24,175
No.

718
00:44:25,247 --> 00:44:26,492
Well, it's kind of...

719
00:44:26,492 --> 00:44:27,584
I knew it.

720
00:44:27,584 --> 00:44:29,314
I cannot even wait
until Megan gets back.

721
00:44:29,314 --> 00:44:31,925
She might believe it.
It's kind of obvious.

722
00:44:32,746 --> 00:44:34,947
Come on, this isn't just
some juicy gossip.

723
00:44:34,947 --> 00:44:37,462
Two seconds ago,
you were practically grieving.

724
00:44:37,462 --> 00:44:39,990
Have some sense
of decency.

725
00:45:15,097 --> 00:45:17,647
Didn't your mom ever tell you
not to swim alone?

726
00:45:20,802 --> 00:45:22,608
You were sleeping.

727
00:45:24,106 --> 00:45:25,146
Where's Mark?

728
00:45:25,956 --> 00:45:28,002
It's his day
to find fruit.

729
00:45:28,002 --> 00:45:30,881
That reminds me.
I need to get the water.

730
00:45:31,583 --> 00:45:33,232
Do you want some company?

731
00:45:33,232 --> 00:45:35,442
Don't you have to
man the beach?

732
00:45:35,442 --> 00:45:37,867
Not if Mark gets back.

733
00:45:37,867 --> 00:45:41,986
Besides, it'll give him
some time to work on his tan.

734
00:45:47,114 --> 00:45:49,239
So,
you don't like Mark.

735
00:45:49,239 --> 00:45:52,085
Wow.
That wasn't even a question.

736
00:45:52,287 --> 00:45:53,772
Why?

737
00:45:53,772 --> 00:45:55,212
Why don't I like him?

738
00:45:55,212 --> 00:45:56,417
Yeah.

739
00:45:57,736 --> 00:46:00,313
I just don't think he's
everything he pretends to be.

740
00:46:00,313 --> 00:46:02,894
Who said he's pretending?
He's a nice guy.

741
00:46:03,097 --> 00:46:04,003
Can be.

742
00:46:04,003 --> 00:46:05,730
You don't know him
like I do.

743
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:07,442
And you don't know him
like I do.

744
00:46:07,442 --> 00:46:08,228
Come on, Megan.

745
00:46:08,228 --> 00:46:10,836
A few days ago,
he was "Mark Taylor" to you.

746
00:46:10,836 --> 00:46:13,442
A lot has happened
since then.

747
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,856
I just don't see
how you can fall for him.

748
00:46:16,856 --> 00:46:17,862
It.

749
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:22,245
Why do you care
if I like him or not?

750
00:46:22,245 --> 00:46:23,804
I don't.
I just -

751
00:46:25,257 --> 00:46:26,843
I don't want you to forget
who you are.

752
00:46:26,843 --> 00:46:28,056
Thanks, Dad.

753
00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:30,025
Hey, I've seen it.

754
00:46:30,025 --> 00:46:31,415
You're changing.

755
00:46:31,415 --> 00:46:33,255
Change is a good thing.

756
00:46:33,255 --> 00:46:34,443
Not all the time.

757
00:46:34,443 --> 00:46:35,400
What do you know?

758
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,957
Oh, come on.
Don't act like I'm blind.

759
00:46:41,038 --> 00:46:42,673
When you got your job
at the company,

760
00:46:42,673 --> 00:46:44,458
you know what made me
notice you?

761
00:46:45,047 --> 00:46:47,992
You were in the breakroom,
reading The Bible.

762
00:46:47,061 --> 00:46:48,208
Every day you did that.

763
00:46:48,415 --> 00:46:50,291
There was something different
about you.

764
00:46:50,291 --> 00:46:52,215
Yeah,
it's called being a dork.

765
00:46:52,215 --> 00:46:54,412
No. It's called
cherishing something.

766
00:46:54,808 --> 00:46:55,444
Because of your example,

767
00:46:55,444 --> 00:46:56,998
I asked about
what made you different,

768
00:46:56,998 --> 00:47:00,289
what gave you
that light in your eyes.

769
00:47:01,329 --> 00:47:04,693
It made me realize I was missing
something in my life.

770
00:47:05,491 --> 00:47:06,976
How can you
be ashamed of that now?

771
00:47:06,976 --> 00:47:08,086
I'm not!

772
00:47:08,086 --> 00:47:09,631
You got all embarrassed
about praying.

773
00:47:09,853 --> 00:47:11,164
I didn't want to force it on Mark.
- Nice excuse.

774
00:47:11,164 --> 00:47:13,223
What about not going to church?
- I go.

775
00:47:14,357 --> 00:47:17,268
Or clubbing all weekend,
or working even on Sunday?

776
00:47:17,268 --> 00:47:18,752
When I met you,
you never would have done that.

777
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:21,131
Religion, it's so restricting, it's 
been this way my hole life.

778
00:47:21,131 --> 00:47:22,535
You don't know
what it's like.

779
00:47:22,535 --> 00:47:24,943
What? I've acecpted Christ later
 in my life, so could i understand?

780
00:47:24,943 --> 00:47:25,622
Yeah!

781
00:47:25,622 --> 00:47:26,987
I still had to make changes,
but it was worth it.

782
00:47:26,987 --> 00:47:27,629
But for me -

783
00:47:27,629 --> 00:47:29,864
You can rationalize it
all you want.

784
00:47:29,864 --> 00:47:31,337
But until you get past
the excuses

785
00:47:31,337 --> 00:47:34,623
and think about it honestly,
you're just lying to yourself.

786
00:47:42,479 --> 00:47:44,731
Get past the excuses, Megan.
Don't be ashamed.

787
00:47:44,731 --> 00:47:46,761
I am ashamed. Of you!

788
00:47:47,416 --> 00:47:49,059
Why don't you try to deal
with what I face?

789
00:47:49,059 --> 00:47:51,322
Walk a mile in my shoes!

790
00:47:52,231 --> 00:47:54,025
These aren't even shoes!

791
00:48:11,525 --> 00:48:12,349
Nice.

792
00:48:14,042 --> 00:48:16,009
Thanks.

793
00:48:17,928 --> 00:48:18,951
Where's Megan?

794
00:48:20,972 --> 00:48:22,605
She's not back?

795
00:48:23,068 --> 00:48:26,039
No. I thought you guys
went to go get water.

796
00:48:27,123 --> 00:48:28,408
We split up.

797
00:48:58,774 --> 00:48:59,991
A little help here.

798
00:49:04,394 --> 00:49:06,228
She's still not back.

799
00:49:11,232 --> 00:49:12,873
It's going to
get dark soon.

800
00:49:17,059 --> 00:49:18,449
Let's go find her.

801
00:49:30,817 --> 00:49:31,896
Megan!

802
00:49:33,008 --> 00:49:35,509
What did you guys fight about
anyway?

803
00:49:35,509 --> 00:49:37,345
Who says we fought?

804
00:49:37,345 --> 00:49:39,296
I'm not trying to make you
feel guilty.

805
00:49:39,296 --> 00:49:40,432
Just a guess.

806
00:49:41,994 --> 00:49:43,575
It's complicated.

807
00:49:46,288 --> 00:49:49,683
Wait. Do you guys have a thing
going on or something?

808
00:49:49,683 --> 00:49:51,328
What? No.

809
00:49:51,328 --> 00:49:52,387
No?

810
00:49:53,122 --> 00:49:53,911
Okay.

811
00:49:56,295 --> 00:49:57,541
Well, we're just...

812
00:49:57,541 --> 00:49:58,826
friends.
- Right.

813
00:49:59,521 --> 00:50:00,369
Good.

814
00:50:02,164 --> 00:50:03,245
I've known her awhile,

815
00:50:05,667 --> 00:50:07,833
and I worry about some of
the things she's mixed up in.

816
00:50:07,833 --> 00:50:08,918
What?
Like drugs?

817
00:50:08,918 --> 00:50:10,449
No, nothing like that.

818
00:50:10,449 --> 00:50:13,315
Megan's a grown woman.
She knows what she's doing.

819
00:50:14,088 --> 00:50:15,217
I hope so.

820
00:50:15,506 --> 00:50:16,665
What was that?

821
00:50:17,767 --> 00:50:18,881
Just because somebody knows
what they're doing

822
00:50:18,881 --> 00:50:20,461
doesn't mean it's right.

823
00:50:20,461 --> 00:50:23,039
Why do I get the feeling
you're turning this on me?

824
00:50:23,287 --> 00:50:26,382
I'm not trying to make you
feel guilty or anything.

825
00:50:26,855 --> 00:50:27,600
Megan!

826
00:50:28,912 --> 00:50:30,146
Just level with me.

827
00:50:30,348 --> 00:50:32,085
Last year, you took credit
for what wasn't yours.

828
00:50:32,085 --> 00:50:33,350
You get that, right?

829
00:50:33,552 --> 00:50:34,919
You see it that way.

830
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,248
We all agreed to work
on the C25 together,

831
00:50:37,248 --> 00:50:38,560
but I was the Manager.

832
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:40,084
I get blamed
for the failures.

833
00:50:40,286 --> 00:50:41,415
And the successes?

834
00:50:41,696 --> 00:50:42,584
It was our success.

835
00:50:42,584 --> 00:50:43,759
That's not what you told
everyone.

836
00:50:43,759 --> 00:50:44,849
It doesn't matter.

837
00:50:44,849 --> 00:50:46,954
Who do you think
they want to succeed?

838
00:50:46,954 --> 00:50:48,186
You have to be
in front of the pack

839
00:50:48,186 --> 00:50:49,884
and appeal
to what they expect.

840
00:50:49,884 --> 00:50:54,497
If you want success,
you have to make it and take it.

841
00:50:55,887 --> 00:50:57,954
Maybe you're just not cut out
for it.

842
00:50:59,763 --> 00:51:01,663
Maybe it's
not worth it.

843
00:51:01,952 --> 00:51:03,342
Not like that.

844
00:51:12,062 --> 00:51:13,231
Where's the...

845
00:51:14,934 --> 00:51:17,335
Is this my punishment?

846
00:51:19,703 --> 00:51:22,543
I only missed a few Sundays.

847
00:51:26,434 --> 00:51:27,784
I wonder if she made it
back to the beach.

848
00:51:29,046 --> 00:51:31,926
She's got the internal compass
of Hansel and Gretel,

849
00:51:31,926 --> 00:51:34,739
without the breadcrumbs.

850
00:51:34,739 --> 00:51:36,297
Well,
we haven't found her.

851
00:51:36,297 --> 00:51:37,518
You think?

852
00:51:38,356 --> 00:51:39,253
Megan!

853
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:42,693
Nope.
Still no Megan.

854
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:44,638
You're welcome to go
back to camp at any time.

855
00:51:47,003 --> 00:51:47,862
Let's split up.

856
00:51:48,203 --> 00:51:48,782
Fine.

857
00:52:03,110 --> 00:52:04,088
Megan!

858
00:52:14,747 --> 00:52:15,705
Chris!

859
00:52:16,514 --> 00:52:17,544
Mark!

860
00:52:25,794 --> 00:52:27,135
Megan!

861
00:52:44,201 --> 00:52:46,201
Megan, can you hear me?

862
00:52:53,263 --> 00:52:57,342
Dear Lord, I'm sorry.

863
00:52:57,342 --> 00:52:59,331
Please help.

864
00:53:05,199 --> 00:53:06,738
Help!

865
00:53:10,350 --> 00:53:11,070
Megan?

866
00:53:11,853 --> 00:53:12,541
Hello?

867
00:53:12,858 --> 00:53:13,572
Megan!

868
00:53:14,563 --> 00:53:15,266
Chris?

869
00:53:20,262 --> 00:53:21,526
Can you climb up to me?

870
00:53:21,526 --> 00:53:24,172
It's too steep.
I keep slipping.

871
00:53:27,126 --> 00:53:27,772
Hang on!

872
00:53:38,452 --> 00:53:40,065
Grab the vine.
I'll pull you up.

873
00:53:48,545 --> 00:53:50,502
Come on, I've got you.

874
00:53:51,187 --> 00:53:52,091
It's okay.

875
00:54:07,241 --> 00:54:08,550
I slipped.

876
00:54:09,427 --> 00:54:10,636
I can tell.

877
00:54:11,888 --> 00:54:13,252
How'd you get up here?

878
00:54:13,502 --> 00:54:15,564
I was trying to get
back to the beach.

879
00:54:15,564 --> 00:54:18,398
You're on a cliff.
Beaches are at sea level.

880
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:20,570
I don't know
where everything is.

881
00:54:20,570 --> 00:54:21,644
I thought
it might get me back.

882
00:54:21,644 --> 00:54:22,628
Okay.

883
00:54:27,186 --> 00:54:30,838
I'm sorry about before.

884
00:54:33,518 --> 00:54:34,648
I didn't want
to make you mad,I just...

885
00:54:35,992 --> 00:54:37,615
I know.

886
00:54:42,322 --> 00:54:45,747
Megan,
I want you to be happy.

887
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:49,719
And I know I go about it
the wrong way.

888
00:54:49,719 --> 00:54:50,944
Mark: Megan!

889
00:54:52,829 --> 00:54:53,807
Are you okay?

890
00:54:54,536 --> 00:54:55,460
I am now.

891
00:54:57,449 --> 00:54:59,585
Let's get you cleaned up
and back to the fire.

892
00:54:59,585 --> 00:55:00,250
Come on.

893
00:55:13,854 --> 00:55:15,813
It's almost done.

894
00:55:18,226 --> 00:55:19,356
You want some water?

895
00:55:19,559 --> 00:55:20,419
Sure.

896
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:34,498
Thank you.

897
00:55:36,372 --> 00:55:37,964
For finding me.

898
00:55:43,753 --> 00:55:45,661
I'm glad
you weren't hurt.

899
00:55:47,035 --> 00:55:48,840
Here.
- Thanks.

900
00:55:51,934 --> 00:55:54,392
Should we, um...

901
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:56,015
Should we pray?

902
00:55:59,702 --> 00:56:00,706
Go for it.

903
00:56:01,641 --> 00:56:03,433
I never got into it,
but...

904
00:56:03,433 --> 00:56:04,530
Really?

905
00:56:06,167 --> 00:56:08,030
God requires
too much time.

906
00:56:08,464 --> 00:56:10,976
I'm busy enough
as it is.

907
00:56:14,189 --> 00:56:15,529
I'll say it.

908
00:56:27,351 --> 00:56:28,749
I could use
another one of these.

909
00:56:30,503 --> 00:56:32,270
Can I have the shell
when you're done?

910
00:56:32,270 --> 00:56:33,600
What for?

911
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,175
Um...

912
00:56:35,175 --> 00:56:36,507
Remember
that flare idea?

913
00:56:36,756 --> 00:56:37,840
You found a flare?

914
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:39,688
No.
I'm making one.

915
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:41,584
You really think
you can make one?

916
00:56:42,029 --> 00:56:43,418
Contents
under pressure.

917
00:56:43,418 --> 00:56:47,435
When they get hot,
say by fire, they explode.

918
00:56:49,333 --> 00:56:52,247
Put all that in a coconut shell
with the flame,

919
00:56:52,584 --> 00:56:53,581
It might work.

920
00:56:53,957 --> 00:56:55,667
You take yourself
too seriously.

921
00:56:55,882 --> 00:56:57,638
So, it's a mini bomb.

922
00:56:58,034 --> 00:56:59,382
Isn't that dangerous?

923
00:56:59,382 --> 00:57:01,708
I'm not saying I'm gonna hold it
up when I light it,

924
00:57:01,708 --> 00:57:03,267
but if it works...

925
00:57:03,267 --> 00:57:04,017
If.

926
00:57:05,262 --> 00:57:06,725
What about
somebody seeing it?

927
00:57:06,725 --> 00:57:08,598
From a distance?

928
00:57:10,283 --> 00:57:12,158
I haven't thought
that far.

929
00:57:12,629 --> 00:57:14,329
You can say that again.

930
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:17,688
It's clever.

931
00:57:27,757 --> 00:57:29,882
Why aren't you intimidated
by him

932
00:57:30,189 --> 00:57:32,618
or by
what anyone else thinks?

933
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:36,838
Especially church?

934
00:57:36,838 --> 00:57:39,332
I feel like everyone looks down
on us for beliving in God.

935
00:57:39,872 --> 00:57:40,913
Do they?

936
00:57:41,821 --> 00:57:43,453
I didn't
when I met you.

937
00:57:43,453 --> 00:57:46,038
Yeah, well,
you're a rare exception.

938
00:57:46,545 --> 00:57:49,314
I think most people respect
what you believe.

939
00:57:49,314 --> 00:57:51,833
It doesn't
feel that way.

940
00:57:51,833 --> 00:57:55,519
You're letting it bother you
more than it should.

941
00:57:55,519 --> 00:57:59,210
Sure, believing in God,
trying to do what's right.

942
00:57:59,817 --> 00:58:01,276
It makes us stand out
a little.

943
00:58:01,276 --> 00:58:02,837
A little?

944
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:05,856
What's more important?

945
00:58:05,856 --> 00:58:09,544
What everyone else thinks
or what God thinks?

946
00:58:12,158 --> 00:58:17,006
I've heard that before,
but it's not that simple.

947
00:58:17,006 --> 00:58:18,615
Sure, it is.

948
00:58:18,942 --> 00:58:20,382
Not for me.

949
00:58:20,863 --> 00:58:22,736
It can be.

950
00:58:23,211 --> 00:58:24,628
Look, for me,

951
00:58:24,628 --> 00:58:27,609
I'd be crazy if I gave up
something I know is true

952
00:58:27,609 --> 00:58:30,385
for what everyone else thinks
is more important.

953
00:58:30,385 --> 00:58:32,315
Fame. Wealth.

954
00:58:32,315 --> 00:58:33,519
Respect.

955
00:58:33,770 --> 00:58:35,960
Those aren't
all bad things.

956
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:40,567
No, not if you have
your priorities straight.

957
00:58:43,882 --> 00:58:46,070
Was it a hard adjustment
for you?

958
00:58:46,474 --> 00:58:47,603
Yeah.

959
00:58:48,084 --> 00:58:51,942
But it was worth it,
because it's true.

960
00:58:52,223 --> 00:58:56,007
God is real,
and he loves us.

961
00:58:56,007 --> 00:58:59,333
What else matters?

962
00:59:08,874 --> 00:59:09,837
Mr. Davidson.

963
00:59:09,837 --> 00:59:10,696
Have a seat.

964
00:59:12,707 --> 00:59:16,629
John, you've been taking on
a lot of Chris Russell's work.

965
00:59:16,850 --> 00:59:19,400
Yes, sir,
until he gets back.

966
00:59:19,843 --> 00:59:21,883
There's a reality
we have to face.

967
00:59:21,883 --> 00:59:24,398
We have to move forward,
and that means making changes.

968
00:59:24,398 --> 00:59:26,127
You've been doing
a good job,

969
00:59:26,127 --> 00:59:28,913
so we'd like you to take over
for Chris permanently.

970
00:59:31,122 --> 00:59:33,073
But when he comes back,
then...

971
00:59:33,565 --> 00:59:37,086
If he gets back,
we'll adjust.

972
00:59:37,712 --> 00:59:38,918
Keep up the good work.

973
00:59:44,841 --> 00:59:45,924
See anything?

974
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:47,967
Minnow.

975
00:59:48,314 --> 00:59:49,215
Filling.

976
00:59:49,602 --> 00:59:51,121
Any luck?

977
00:59:51,534 --> 00:59:52,537
Not yet.

978
00:59:55,492 --> 00:59:57,113
Oh,
I'll be right back.

979
01:00:05,642 --> 01:00:06,337
Thanks.

980
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:09,317
Are we going to have anything
to cook today?

981
01:00:09,529 --> 01:00:11,190
The fish
aren't cooperating.

982
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:13,961
I'd love to go for anything
besides just fish.

983
01:00:14,289 --> 01:00:15,928
Like...

984
01:00:16,171 --> 01:00:17,956
Chinese food.

985
01:00:18,584 --> 01:00:20,962
Well, if I see any Szechuan
Chicken running around,

986
01:00:20,962 --> 01:00:22,273
I'll let you know.

987
01:00:22,813 --> 01:00:24,822
I'd even settle
for Indonesian food.

988
01:00:24,822 --> 01:00:26,279
I was looking forward
to that.

989
01:00:26,279 --> 01:00:28,899
If we made it without any
problems, we wouldn't care.

990
01:00:28,899 --> 01:00:30,945
We'd probably be wishing
we had a burger.

991
01:00:30,945 --> 01:00:32,040
That's true.

992
01:00:32,552 --> 01:00:34,046
I guess sometimes
we just take things for granted

993
01:00:34,046 --> 01:00:35,720
that are
right in front of us.

994
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:36,851
Yep.

995
01:00:42,646 --> 01:00:43,768
Like matches.

996
01:00:43,768 --> 01:00:46,148
I've got a whole drawerful in
my kitchen next to the candles,

997
01:00:46,349 --> 01:00:48,977
and here it takes Chris forever
just to light a fire.

998
01:00:50,185 --> 01:00:52,172
Candles?

999
01:00:53,002 --> 01:00:54,255
So?

1000
01:00:54,902 --> 01:00:56,320
They smell nice.

1001
01:01:34,347 --> 01:01:35,206
Boom.

1002
01:01:45,994 --> 01:01:48,889
Didn't you say something
about swimming alone?

1003
01:01:53,269 --> 01:01:56,171
This reminds me
of my sister's place.

1004
01:01:56,171 --> 01:01:57,976
She lives near a beach?

1005
01:01:57,976 --> 01:01:59,282
Yeah.

1006
01:02:00,116 --> 01:02:02,366
I spent a summer there
a couple years ago.

1007
01:02:02,366 --> 01:02:05,089
It was actually right before
I decided to get baptized.

1008
01:02:05,089 --> 01:02:07,755
It's a good place to get away,
clear your head,

1009
01:02:07,755 --> 01:02:10,898
find the answers that you're
searching for, you know?

1010
01:02:12,601 --> 01:02:15,996
It's also about five minutes
away from McDonald's.

1011
01:02:17,377 --> 01:02:19,670
I wish
we were there now.

1012
01:02:23,037 --> 01:02:25,214
Was your family okay
with you getting baptized?

1013
01:02:26,336 --> 01:02:29,081
They thought it was weird
that I wanted it.

1014
01:02:29,081 --> 01:02:33,273
My parents had some concerns,
but they're cool with it now.

1015
01:02:38,602 --> 01:02:40,585
Hey, I was thinking.

1016
01:02:40,585 --> 01:02:41,619
Yeah?

1017
01:02:43,454 --> 01:02:44,337
I...

1018
01:02:45,707 --> 01:02:50,881
We both work a lot,
and I see you there.

1019
01:02:50,881 --> 01:02:51,573
Okay.

1020
01:02:53,344 --> 01:02:59,077
But it'd be nice if I could see
you, you know, somewhere else.

1021
01:02:59,829 --> 01:03:01,787
Chris,
I get it, okay?

1022
01:03:01,787 --> 01:03:03,675
I know I need to be better
about going to church,

1023
01:03:03,879 --> 01:03:06,455
but you just
have to let me.

1024
01:03:07,329 --> 01:03:09,031
No, that's not
what I meant.

1025
01:03:10,018 --> 01:03:10,792
Really?

1026
01:03:12,869 --> 01:03:14,612
I was hoping maybe -
- Hey!

1027
01:03:14,612 --> 01:03:16,643
Do you guys have
any more water?

1028
01:03:16,846 --> 01:03:19,348
No,
but I can go get some.

1029
01:03:20,761 --> 01:03:22,367
Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1030
01:03:23,074 --> 01:03:24,324
Okay.

1031
01:03:24,952 --> 01:03:27,698
I was just hoping
we could go out sometime.

1032
01:03:27,698 --> 01:03:29,326
Did you say something?

1033
01:03:30,277 --> 01:03:31,356
No.

1034
01:03:33,949 --> 01:03:36,244
Does it ever feel like

1035
01:03:36,468 --> 01:03:39,078
something always gets in the way
of what you want?

1036
01:03:40,096 --> 01:03:42,014
Sure, sometimes.

1037
01:03:42,323 --> 01:03:44,371
It's pretty annoying.

1038
01:03:44,371 --> 01:03:47,430
That's why you got to keep
trying and never give up.

1039
01:03:47,430 --> 01:03:49,956
Although, if you keep trying
and still don't get anywhere...

1040
01:03:49,956 --> 01:03:52,002
It just depends
on how bad you want it.

1041
01:03:52,002 --> 01:03:55,866
If you quit,
you're guaranteed to fail.

1042
01:03:56,436 --> 01:03:57,685
I'm going to get
some fruit.

1043
01:04:24,597 --> 01:04:25,609
Megan.

1044
01:04:26,333 --> 01:04:28,369
We've always had
a great friendship.

1045
01:04:28,620 --> 01:04:29,738
I really value that.

1046
01:04:29,738 --> 01:04:31,339
It's just I...

1047
01:04:31,804 --> 01:04:34,444
always wanted something more.

1048
01:04:36,439 --> 01:04:37,366
No.

1049
01:04:37,366 --> 01:04:40,034
Get to the point faster,
before something interrupts.

1050
01:04:42,115 --> 01:04:43,527
Megan, hi.

1051
01:04:48,107 --> 01:04:49,514
Great!

1052
01:05:01,445 --> 01:05:02,491
Could work.

1053
01:05:05,737 --> 01:05:08,388
Megan, I just think that...

1054
01:05:09,901 --> 01:05:11,350
Hey.
- Hey!

1055
01:05:11,761 --> 01:05:13,736
Came to make sure
you didn't get lost again.

1056
01:05:13,736 --> 01:05:15,736
I got here,
didn't I?

1057
01:05:16,532 --> 01:05:17,456
Yeah.

1058
01:05:17,456 --> 01:05:18,681
I was just thinking.

1059
01:05:18,681 --> 01:05:20,893
I wonder how everyone is
back at home.

1060
01:05:21,115 --> 01:05:22,762
Probably business
as usual.

1061
01:05:23,032 --> 01:05:25,175
Come on,
someone would miss us.

1062
01:05:25,752 --> 01:05:27,436
You, sure.

1063
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:29,749
Don't you have family?

1064
01:05:30,094 --> 01:05:32,107
Yeah, but I think I have
some old girlfriend listed

1065
01:05:32,107 --> 01:05:34,108
as my emergency contact.

1066
01:05:34,628 --> 01:05:36,421
Well, she'd call them.

1067
01:05:36,421 --> 01:05:37,802
It didn't end well.

1068
01:05:37,802 --> 01:05:40,591
She'd probably be celebrating
if she thought I was dead.

1069
01:05:41,123 --> 01:05:41,924
Wow.

1070
01:05:43,283 --> 01:05:44,530
What about you?

1071
01:05:45,553 --> 01:05:49,696
They're out of State,
but they're probably panicking.

1072
01:05:50,214 --> 01:05:51,331
Hey.

1073
01:05:51,331 --> 01:05:52,960
They'll be fine.

1074
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:54,633
We'll get back.

1075
01:06:06,548 --> 01:06:10,354
Megan, when I think
of a flower...

1076
01:06:11,694 --> 01:06:13,487
I've hit a new low.

1077
01:06:12,718 --> 01:06:17,285
Okay.
Just what I want her to know? How I feel.

1078
01:06:19,958 --> 01:06:22,585
Megan, I like you.

1079
01:06:23,803 --> 01:06:26,313
Smooth.
Just blurt it out, Chris.

1080
01:06:26,313 --> 01:06:29,170
Smart.
You are so smart, Chris.

1081
01:06:29,419 --> 01:06:30,652
Okay, how about...

1082
01:06:32,023 --> 01:06:35,098
It could have been worse.
I keep telling myself that.

1083
01:06:35,832 --> 01:06:39,023
If you didn't come on the trip,
it'd be Chris and me stuck here.

1084
01:06:39,622 --> 01:06:41,725
A nightmare
for you both.

1085
01:06:42,128 --> 01:06:43,972
I'm glad you came.

1086
01:06:43,972 --> 01:06:46,075
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

1087
01:06:47,284 --> 01:06:49,757
What about your girlfriend?
Jenna?

1088
01:06:50,365 --> 01:06:51,617
No.

1089
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:54,491
Or any of the other girls
you date?

1090
01:06:54,491 --> 01:06:56,666
I've got a bit of a reputation,
don't I?

1091
01:06:56,666 --> 01:06:58,443
I didn't mean that.

1092
01:06:59,159 --> 01:07:01,924
The girls I've dated,
they're fun, but that's it.

1093
01:07:01,924 --> 01:07:03,336
There's nothing more
to it.

1094
01:07:03,336 --> 01:07:08,401
I know that sounds awful.

1095
01:07:08,401 --> 01:07:09,757
They just try to get
my attention,

1096
01:07:10,319 --> 01:07:11,465
Instead of being
the type of girl

1097
01:07:11,465 --> 01:07:14,418
that just catches your attention
automatically.

1098
01:07:17,623 --> 01:07:18,654
Like you.

1099
01:07:27,799 --> 01:07:29,303
Listen, Megan, if nothing else,

1100
01:07:29,303 --> 01:07:32,779
I just thought you should know
in case you felt the same...

1101
01:07:35,545 --> 01:07:36,914
...way.

1102
01:07:48,812 --> 01:07:49,274
I'm sorry.

1103
01:07:49,274 --> 01:07:50,703
I hope I didn't
cross some line.

1104
01:07:50,703 --> 01:07:52,789
Yeah.
No, it was fine.

1105
01:07:55,345 --> 01:07:55,971
You sure?

1106
01:07:56,433 --> 01:07:57,813
I don't want it to be awkward
for us.

1107
01:07:58,279 --> 01:07:59,488
I'm sure.

1108
01:08:08,517 --> 01:08:09,307
Good.

1109
01:08:09,655 --> 01:08:10,570
Not awkward.

1110
01:09:03,047 --> 01:09:05,893
I finally broke things off,
and I was so relieved.

1111
01:09:05,893 --> 01:09:09,485
That totally reminds me
of this guy that I dated.

1112
01:09:13,648 --> 01:09:15,859
Hey,
where have you been?

1113
01:09:16,572 --> 01:09:17,644
Working.

1114
01:09:27,442 --> 01:09:28,467
What's this?

1115
01:09:29,310 --> 01:09:30,392
Catapult.

1116
01:09:31,356 --> 01:09:33,299
Is this what you've been
working on?

1117
01:09:33,299 --> 01:09:34,648
Yeah.

1118
01:09:34,648 --> 01:09:35,960
Why?

1119
01:09:36,566 --> 01:09:38,332
I'm ready to get off
this island.

1120
01:09:41,050 --> 01:09:42,411
What's it for?

1121
01:09:42,622 --> 01:09:43,845
To launch the flare.

1122
01:09:46,577 --> 01:09:47,395
Give that back.

1123
01:09:48,937 --> 01:09:49,988
Seriously, Chris.

1124
01:09:49,988 --> 01:09:51,693
Is this the best
you can come up with?

1125
01:09:52,068 --> 01:09:52,897
Tell you what.

1126
01:09:53,186 --> 01:09:55,257
You think of something better
with the resources we have,

1127
01:09:55,257 --> 01:09:57,668
and you can criticize me
all you want.

1128
01:10:38,556 --> 01:10:40,126
What are you
looking for?

1129
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:42,284
Cologne.

1130
01:10:42,776 --> 01:10:44,321
Won't help
with the smell.

1131
01:10:46,358 --> 01:10:47,778
Have you seen
my shaving cream?

1132
01:10:48,724 --> 01:10:49,947
Yeah.

1133
01:10:51,036 --> 01:10:52,174
Hey!

1134
01:10:54,161 --> 01:10:55,387
What's his problem?

1135
01:10:56,081 --> 01:10:57,345
I don't know.

1136
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:04,153
Hey.

1137
01:11:05,030 --> 01:11:05,859
Hey.

1138
01:11:06,659 --> 01:11:08,922
Is this
what you've been doing?

1139
01:11:08,922 --> 01:11:10,153
Yeah.

1140
01:11:10,558 --> 01:11:12,414
You built a catapult.

1141
01:11:15,599 --> 01:11:17,705
Why didn't you ask us
for help?

1142
01:11:18,921 --> 01:11:21,054
I didn't know
how much support I'd get.

1143
01:11:21,469 --> 01:11:23,143
Plus, you were caught up
in other things.

1144
01:11:23,656 --> 01:11:25,887
You know,
you're not so subtle.

1145
01:11:25,887 --> 01:11:27,469
Sorry.

1146
01:11:28,718 --> 01:11:31,893
Mark's really sweet,
even more than I thought before.

1147
01:11:32,589 --> 01:11:34,277
I didn't think
that was possible.

1148
01:11:34,481 --> 01:11:35,994
Come on,
don't do that.

1149
01:11:35,994 --> 01:11:37,637
Be happy for me.

1150
01:11:38,928 --> 01:11:41,028
If you're happy,
I guess that's all that matters.

1151
01:11:42,768 --> 01:11:45,152
I just don't want you
to get hurt.

1152
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:47,608
I won't get hurt.

1153
01:11:48,845 --> 01:11:52,297
When we get back, do you think
he's going to be as sweet?

1154
01:11:52,297 --> 01:11:56,699
Do you ever wonder why he always
has a new girlfriend?

1155
01:11:57,657 --> 01:11:59,297
You'll start to see
who he really is.

1156
01:11:59,297 --> 01:12:00,401
I like who he is.

1157
01:12:00,401 --> 01:12:02,684
You like who you think he is.
There's a difference.

1158
01:12:02,684 --> 01:12:04,724
Why are you being so mean about this?
- I'm not.

1159
01:12:04,936 --> 01:12:07,124
I'm just trying to get
out of here.

1160
01:12:08,998 --> 01:12:10,448
You two may be happy
to stay here forever,

1161
01:12:10,448 --> 01:12:12,417
But I'm not going to stick
around as the third wheel.

1162
01:12:12,417 --> 01:12:13,331
What?

1163
01:12:14,463 --> 01:12:15,998
I can't take this.

1164
01:12:15,998 --> 01:12:17,632
What are you
talking about?

1165
01:12:17,632 --> 01:12:19,767
You really don't know?
- No.

1166
01:12:19,767 --> 01:12:21,890
I'm talking about you.

1167
01:12:21,890 --> 01:12:22,640
Us.

1168
01:12:23,607 --> 01:12:25,173
I've been trying to tell you
for the longest time,

1169
01:12:26,185 --> 01:12:28,922
but you barely even notice me
when Mark's around.

1170
01:12:30,887 --> 01:12:32,923
I like you, Megan.

1171
01:12:32,923 --> 01:12:34,235
A lot.

1172
01:12:34,755 --> 01:12:37,341
But now
I'm not even sure why.

1173
01:12:37,553 --> 01:12:39,969
I mean, do we still believe
in the same things?

1174
01:12:39,969 --> 01:12:41,356
Don't question
what I believe.

1175
01:12:41,356 --> 01:12:43,260
Just because I don't make
a spectacle out of being a christian

1176
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:44,565
doesn't mean
I don't believe.

1177
01:12:44,565 --> 01:12:46,949
Your actions are a reflection
of your beliefs.

1178
01:12:46,949 --> 01:12:48,925
You're trying so hard to fit in
and be accepted

1179
01:12:48,925 --> 01:12:51,581
that you're compromising
the things that really matter.

1180
01:12:51,581 --> 01:12:52,535
You know what?

1181
01:12:52,535 --> 01:12:54,027
I'm tired of you
always judging me.

1182
01:12:54,027 --> 01:12:55,575
Nothing I do
is ever good enough.

1183
01:12:55,575 --> 01:12:56,577
I'm never strong enough,

1184
01:12:56,577 --> 01:12:58,048
not the perfect person
you want me to be.

1185
01:12:58,048 --> 01:12:59,704
Why don't you stop being
so self-righteous

1186
01:12:59,704 --> 01:13:01,811
and let me be who I am?

1187
01:13:03,017 --> 01:13:06,087
You're right.

1188
01:13:06,087 --> 01:13:12,046
I just worry about you,
probably more than I should.

1189
01:13:13,030 --> 01:13:17,636
I just see these glimpses of
the Megan I fell in love with.

1190
01:13:19,740 --> 01:13:21,906
It doesn't matter.

1191
01:13:22,283 --> 01:13:25,537
I guess
you've made your choice.

1192
01:13:37,966 --> 01:13:39,827
Where have you been?

1193
01:13:43,071 --> 01:13:44,962
Just thinking.

1194
01:13:58,824 --> 01:14:00,864
I can't.

1195
01:14:03,826 --> 01:14:06,760
I can't take it anymore.

1196
01:14:10,322 --> 01:14:12,058
Please.

1197
01:14:12,764 --> 01:14:14,791
This is my limit.

1198
01:14:22,414 --> 01:14:23,639
Help me.

1199
01:14:24,932 --> 01:14:25,665
Please.

1200
01:15:03,380 --> 01:15:04,850
What's that?

1201
01:15:23,221 --> 01:15:25,460
Is that really
what I think it is?

1202
01:15:25,460 --> 01:15:27,781
Plane!
It's a plane!

1203
01:15:28,611 --> 01:15:29,940
Wait!

1204
01:15:33,986 --> 01:15:36,711
Hey!
Come on, where are you?

1205
01:15:36,711 --> 01:15:38,571
I can hear it.

1206
01:15:41,958 --> 01:15:43,773
There!

1207
01:15:45,130 --> 01:15:46,132
Hey!
- Hey!

1208
01:15:46,132 --> 01:15:47,660
Hey!
- Hey!

1209
01:15:48,443 --> 01:15:49,780
We are over here!

1210
01:15:49,780 --> 01:15:52,778
Hey!
- Come on!

1211
01:15:52,778 --> 01:15:54,028
Help!

1212
01:15:54,028 --> 01:15:57,415
Wait!
Don't go. Don't go. Don't go.

1213
01:15:58,321 --> 01:15:59,633
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1214
01:15:59,848 --> 01:16:02,408
Please work.

1215
01:16:16,250 --> 01:16:17,331
Chris' flare!

1216
01:16:34,062 --> 01:16:36,110
Over here!

1217
01:16:39,813 --> 01:16:41,342
He's turning around!

1218
01:16:41,834 --> 01:16:42,904
Down here!

1219
01:16:43,204 --> 01:16:44,622
They see the flare!

1220
01:16:44,894 --> 01:16:45,892
Come on. Down here.

1221
01:16:45,892 --> 01:16:46,960
Hey!

1222
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:47,925
Hey!

1223
01:16:49,016 --> 01:16:50,857
Down here!

1224
01:16:59,874 --> 01:17:03,224
Yes! 
Over here!

1225
01:17:03,470 --> 01:17:05,061
Over here!

1226
01:17:05,677 --> 01:17:06,767
Yes!

1227
01:17:06,767 --> 01:17:07,933
Hey!

1228
01:17:11,947 --> 01:17:13,335
Yes! Come on!

1229
01:17:17,204 --> 01:17:18,501
We're going home!

1230
01:17:54,836 --> 01:17:55,863
Hey.
- Hi.

1231
01:17:55,863 --> 01:17:57,644
Wow, you look great!
- Thank you.

1232
01:17:57,644 --> 01:17:59,222
Not bad for your first day
back at work.

1233
01:17:59,644 --> 01:18:00,480
Oh well i do what i can.

1234
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:01,894
It's too bad
about those shoes tough.

1235
01:18:02,335 --> 01:18:03,896
I can't believe you and Mark
are a thing.

1236
01:18:03,896 --> 01:18:05,430
I don't know what the rest of us
are going to do.

1237
01:18:05,665 --> 01:18:06,419
But there's a new guy.

1238
01:18:06,971 --> 01:18:09,202
Not only is he tall and rich,
he's divorced.

1239
01:18:17,368 --> 01:18:18,419
Congratulations.

1240
01:18:19,678 --> 01:18:21,190
I was going
for "glad you're alive,"

1241
01:18:21,190 --> 01:18:23,875
but this was all they had left
at the bakery.

1242
01:18:24,093 --> 01:18:25,772
I think it confused
some people.

1243
01:18:25,772 --> 01:18:26,973
Nice.

1244
01:18:27,222 --> 01:18:28,174
Just glad
to have you back.

1245
01:18:28,913 --> 01:18:29,851
Thanks.

1246
01:18:34,379 --> 01:18:35,443
Hey, Mark.

1247
01:18:36,365 --> 01:18:37,290
Hey.

1248
01:18:38,028 --> 01:18:40,879
So, I owe you
a new pair of jeans.

1249
01:18:41,898 --> 01:18:42,808
Thanks.

1250
01:18:45,078 --> 01:18:47,248
Do you want to get something
to eat tonight?

1251
01:18:47,563 --> 01:18:49,452
Some Chinese food?

1252
01:18:50,704 --> 01:18:52,858
I can't. I've got too much
to catch up on.

1253
01:19:03,162 --> 01:19:04,259
What's the occasion?

1254
01:19:04,795 --> 01:19:06,062
Being alive.

1255
01:19:06,062 --> 01:19:07,505
John got it for me.

1256
01:19:07,505 --> 01:19:08,515
Nice.

1257
01:19:09,689 --> 01:19:11,608
People I've never met
kept stopping by my desk

1258
01:19:11,608 --> 01:19:12,740
and eating it.

1259
01:19:13,088 --> 01:19:15,298
The cake,
not my desk.

1260
01:19:15,719 --> 01:19:16,616
Got it.

1261
01:19:17,970 --> 01:19:20,241
So, crazy day?

1262
01:19:20,241 --> 01:19:21,780
Not really.

1263
01:19:21,780 --> 01:19:24,222
John pretty much was me
while I was gone.

1264
01:19:24,222 --> 01:19:26,082
Not much for me to do.

1265
01:19:29,948 --> 01:19:34,169
Hey, in all of this, I didn't
get the chance to thank you.

1266
01:19:35,081 --> 01:19:37,238
You got us home.

1267
01:19:37,637 --> 01:19:39,268
The plane helped.

1268
01:19:39,268 --> 01:19:40,688
It wasn't all me.

1269
01:19:41,034 --> 01:19:43,344
But they never would have
seen us,

1270
01:19:43,835 --> 01:19:45,236
and it's not just that.

1271
01:19:45,707 --> 01:19:47,173
You really saved us.

1272
01:19:49,924 --> 01:19:50,967
You're welcome.

1273
01:19:53,073 --> 01:19:57,723
Listen, about what happened,
I wanted to apologize.

1274
01:19:58,029 --> 01:20:01,080
You were right
about me judging you.

1275
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:02,223
I shouldn't have said -

1276
01:20:02,482 --> 01:20:03,611
you...

1277
01:20:03,883 --> 01:20:05,715
You don't
have to apologize.

1278
01:20:08,098 --> 01:20:09,060
I just wanted you to know

1279
01:20:09,060 --> 01:20:12,299
that I'm glad you introduced me
to Christ

1280
01:20:13,266 --> 01:20:16,533
I can´t imagine going back 
 not having him in my life,

1281
01:20:17,691 --> 01:20:22,721
knowing that I'm not alone
makes all the difference.

1282
01:20:25,567 --> 01:20:26,949
You're...

1283
01:20:27,877 --> 01:20:28,899
You're welcome.

1284
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:34,966
Look, today is my last day...
 Okay, I'm ready. Let's go.

1285
01:20:35,177 --> 01:20:37,029
I'll talk to you later.

1286
01:20:41,001 --> 01:20:42,165
Hi, john.
- Hi.

1287
01:20:44,248 --> 01:20:45,127
Need a hand?

1288
01:20:47,607 --> 01:20:48,997
Something you want
to tell me?

1289
01:20:49,768 --> 01:20:50,743
I'm leaving.

1290
01:20:51,338 --> 01:20:54,263
Did they fire you?

1291
01:20:54,263 --> 01:20:57,402
No, it's not that.
It's...

1292
01:20:57,402 --> 01:20:58,802
It's time.

1293
01:21:00,684 --> 01:21:01,330
Chris.

1294
01:21:01,330 --> 01:21:02,872
I need to move on.

1295
01:21:46,787 --> 01:21:48,670
So, how did you survive?

1296
01:21:48,670 --> 01:21:52,462
We ate fruit and coconuts,
anything we could find.

1297
01:21:52,462 --> 01:21:55,059
But then I got to thinking,
"what about fish?"

1298
01:21:55,059 --> 01:21:56,686
So I made this spear.

1299
01:21:56,898 --> 01:22:00,513
I go knee-deep in water
and just waited.

1300
01:22:01,115 --> 01:22:02,245
Skip to the end.

1301
01:22:02,245 --> 01:22:04,382
You guys haven't even heard
the best part.

1302
01:22:04,623 --> 01:22:06,726
Tell them about how you got
everyone off the island.

1303
01:22:06,997 --> 01:22:10,535
So, I gather up all my stuff,
mousse and shaving cream,

1304
01:22:10,908 --> 01:22:13,701
and we put the stuff in coconuts
so we could make a flare.

1305
01:22:13,701 --> 01:22:15,117
Then I got to thinking,

1306
01:22:15,117 --> 01:22:16,891
"How are we gonna get
these flares up in the air?"

1307
01:22:16,891 --> 01:22:18,850
So we build this catapult,
right?

1308
01:22:19,531 --> 01:22:20,033
Hey, John.

1309
01:22:20,448 --> 01:22:21,010
Hey.

1310
01:22:21,540 --> 01:22:23,555
Where's Chris?
He's gone.

1311
01:22:23,777 --> 01:22:26,004
Oh. Do you know
when he'll be back?

1312
01:22:26,719 --> 01:22:27,569
He quit.

1313
01:22:28,215 --> 01:22:30,108
He did? When?

1314
01:22:30,639 --> 01:22:32,065
Yesterday.
You saw him.

1315
01:22:33,031 --> 01:22:34,527
He didn't even
say goodbye.

1316
01:22:34,835 --> 01:22:36,320
Maybe he didn't
get a chance.

1317
01:22:36,851 --> 01:22:40,360
Did you guys hear everything
Mark did on that island?

1318
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:42,069
Yeah.
I was there.

1319
01:22:42,601 --> 01:22:44,050
Oh, yeah. Sorry.
I forget about that.

1320
01:22:44,050 --> 01:22:46,007
So, what is going on
between the two of you?

1321
01:22:47,619 --> 01:22:48,796
I don't know.

1322
01:22:50,968 --> 01:22:52,408
Let's go get some dinner.

1323
01:22:52,957 --> 01:22:55,281
I thought you and Megan
were involved.

1324
01:22:55,281 --> 01:22:58,585
Megan's nice,
but we're just friends.

1325
01:22:58,585 --> 01:22:59,425
Really?

1326
01:22:59,425 --> 01:23:02,233
This may sound awful,
but she's a little shallow.

1327
01:23:02,443 --> 01:23:04,952
I don't know her
that well.

1328
01:23:05,211 --> 01:23:07,482
You should have seen the bag
she brought on the plane.

1329
01:23:07,482 --> 01:23:09,846
That alone was enough
to take us down.

1330
01:24:27,028 --> 01:24:28,860
There you are!
- Hi.

1331
01:24:28,860 --> 01:24:32,624
Hey. Okay, so,
this weekend, Vegas.

1332
01:24:32,624 --> 01:24:34,540
A bunch of us are going.
Are you in?

1333
01:24:35,736 --> 01:24:36,833
Can't.

1334
01:24:36,833 --> 01:24:38,197
I have Church this Sunday.

1335
01:24:38,197 --> 01:24:40,213
You're picking Church
over Vegas?

1336
01:24:40,825 --> 01:24:43,148
You are starting to sound
like Chris.

1337
01:24:43,506 --> 01:24:44,709
What's wrong with that?

1338
01:24:44,917 --> 01:24:48,603
Nothing.
It's just a little geeky.

1339
01:24:50,475 --> 01:24:51,478
Maybe.

1340
01:24:52,011 --> 01:24:53,542
But thanks
for inviting me.

1341
01:24:55,508 --> 01:24:56,857
Okay.

1342
01:25:03,050 --> 01:25:04,229
We'll send that
right over.

1343
01:25:04,556 --> 01:25:05,165
Thank you.

1344
01:25:07,022 --> 01:25:08,846
Hey, Megan.
- Mark.

1345
01:25:09,552 --> 01:25:11,239
I don't have any plans tonight.
Want to go out?

1346
01:25:11,239 --> 01:25:12,920
Thanks, but no.

1347
01:25:13,487 --> 01:25:14,762
What about
tomorrow night?

1348
01:25:15,930 --> 01:25:17,716
It's not an issue of when.

1349
01:25:18,179 --> 01:25:20,489
I think I'm a little
too shallow for you.

1350
01:25:22,225 --> 01:25:24,131
What?
You have a better offer?

1351
01:25:32,298 --> 01:25:35,861
Hey, this is Chris. I'm not around, so
leave a message and i'll get back to you.

1352
01:25:43,994 --> 01:25:45,567
Where is he?
- Who?

1353
01:25:45,567 --> 01:25:47,613
Chris.
He's not answering his phone.

1354
01:25:47,613 --> 01:25:49,169
He said he was
going to relax a bit,

1355
01:25:49,169 --> 01:25:50,799
clear his head
or whatever.

1356
01:25:56,556 --> 01:25:58,471
Hey, this is Chris.
 I'm not around, so

1357
01:25:58,471 --> 01:26:00,395
leave a message
and I'll get back to you.

1358
01:26:00,754 --> 01:26:03,254
Hi. It's Megan.

1359
01:26:03,459 --> 01:26:05,633
I heard you were out of town,

1360
01:26:07,129 --> 01:26:09,363
and I wanted to see you
and talk.

1361
01:26:10,712 --> 01:26:13,035
Give me a call back whenever.

1362
01:26:13,714 --> 01:26:15,504
Yeah. Bye.

1363
01:26:22,803 --> 01:26:24,667
Hey, Megan.
- Hi.

1364
01:26:25,237 --> 01:26:26,671
Did you find Chris?

1365
01:26:26,671 --> 01:26:27,865
Sort of.

1366
01:26:28,212 --> 01:26:29,799
He's at his sister's.

1367
01:26:29,799 --> 01:26:31,116
In Hawaii?

1368
01:26:31,982 --> 01:26:34,995
I called him,
but he hasn't called me back.

1369
01:26:35,215 --> 01:26:36,943
Maybe he didn't check
his messages.

1370
01:26:37,636 --> 01:26:40,092
It might be kind of awkward
over the phone anyway.

1371
01:26:40,752 --> 01:26:41,608
Why?

1372
01:26:42,014 --> 01:26:43,301
Well, he told me -

1373
01:26:44,083 --> 01:26:45,282
I said that -

1374
01:26:46,805 --> 01:26:48,020
It's a long story.

1375
01:26:49,255 --> 01:26:50,879
One of those, huh?

1376
01:26:51,180 --> 01:26:52,241
Yeah.

1377
01:26:53,003 --> 01:26:54,960
It'd be better
face-to-face.

1378
01:26:55,413 --> 01:26:56,870
Then go see him.

1379
01:26:58,182 --> 01:27:00,034
I don't know
that he'd want that.

1380
01:27:01,098 --> 01:27:03,090
Well, there's only one way
to find out.

1381
01:27:04,845 --> 01:27:06,258
I don't know.

1382
01:27:08,549 --> 01:27:12,992
Look, if it's important to you,
isn't it worth it?

1383
01:27:20,926 --> 01:27:22,976
Yeah, a window seat's fine.

1384
01:27:23,631 --> 01:27:25,490
Are you sure there's not
anything else leaving today?

1385
01:27:27,154 --> 01:27:28,139
Two hours?

1386
01:27:28,697 --> 01:27:30,349
No, no.
I can make that.

1387
01:28:11,806 --> 01:28:12,618
Hi.

1388
01:28:13,678 --> 01:28:14,428
Hi.

1389
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:18,053
I don't know if this is
the right place or not.

1390
01:28:18,053 --> 01:28:19,606
I'm looking for Chris.

1391
01:28:19,867 --> 01:28:21,067
Are you his sister?

1392
01:28:21,511 --> 01:28:22,841
You must be Megan.

1393
01:28:23,054 --> 01:28:24,213
Yeah.

1394
01:28:24,213 --> 01:28:25,755
He went down
to the beach.

1395
01:28:26,491 --> 01:28:27,466
Thanks.

1396
01:28:50,633 --> 01:28:52,334
You didn't get enough
of the beach?

1397
01:28:54,801 --> 01:28:56,365
I figured
you'd come here.

1398
01:28:56,700 --> 01:28:59,009
I called around, trying to find
your sister's address.

1399
01:28:59,613 --> 01:29:04,875
I to called your neighbor's you 
Landlord and eventually I've figure it out

1400
01:29:04,875 --> 01:29:08,797
you listed your parents as
 your emergency contact at work.

1401
01:29:09,369 --> 01:29:12,620
Your parents were suspicious
about a random girl calling.

1402
01:29:12,958 --> 01:29:14,996
They finally told me
where you were,

1403
01:29:15,372 --> 01:29:16,949
and I got a flight here.

1404
01:29:19,599 --> 01:29:21,874
How'd you know I'd go
to my sister's place?

1405
01:29:23,212 --> 01:29:25,630
You said you come here
to clear your head.

1406
01:29:29,121 --> 01:29:31,696
So, quit your job.

1407
01:29:33,727 --> 01:29:35,005
It was time.

1408
01:29:37,623 --> 01:29:40,213
I was thinking
of quitting, too.

1409
01:29:40,749 --> 01:29:41,828
Why?

1410
01:29:42,170 --> 01:29:45,290
It might be awkward,
working with Mark.

1411
01:29:49,287 --> 01:29:51,889
I liked
who he pretended to be.

1412
01:29:51,889 --> 01:29:55,390
I kept convincing myself
that's what I wanted.

1413
01:29:55,835 --> 01:29:59,468
I finally realized
you were right about Mark

1414
01:29:59,747 --> 01:30:01,958
and also about me.

1415
01:30:03,417 --> 01:30:07,336
I was changing who I should be
just to try and please everyone.

1416
01:30:08,233 --> 01:30:14,752
You made me realize that,
even if I didn't want to.

1417
01:30:16,789 --> 01:30:18,359
You're a better influence
in my life

1418
01:30:18,359 --> 01:30:20,967
than Mark
or anyone could be.

1419
01:30:24,147 --> 01:30:25,807
I only regret...

1420
01:30:27,308 --> 01:30:29,101
Well, I have two regrets.

1421
01:30:29,882 --> 01:30:31,100
What?

1422
01:30:32,773 --> 01:30:36,150
One, I was doing
all the wrong things.

1423
01:30:36,150 --> 01:30:38,582
I might have opened your eyes
to the Christ,

1424
01:30:38,582 --> 01:30:42,413
but you opened mine
how much He really matters.

1425
01:30:45,231 --> 01:30:52,639
And two, that I might have
missed my chance to be with you.

1426
01:31:03,002 --> 01:31:05,272
You only have one regret.

1427
01:31:25,733 --> 01:31:28,639
So... what's next?

1428
01:31:30,148 --> 01:31:31,328
How about dinner?

1429
01:31:32,033 --> 01:31:33,994
I know
this great sushi place.

1430
01:31:34,197 --> 01:31:35,106
No!

1431
01:31:35,328 --> 01:31:37,451
