1
00:01:29,651 --> 00:01:33,037
"<i>The civil war built a wall of hate
between the North and South</i>."

2
00:01:33,714 --> 00:01:36,547
"<i>And on each side great
armies fought and died</i>."

3
00:01:37,328 --> 00:01:40,215
"<i>But south of St. Louis,
across the Mississippi</i>."

4
00:01:40,638 --> 00:01:41,924
"<i>Was a no-man's land</i>."

5
00:01:42,406 --> 00:01:45,535
"<i>Where guerrilla raiders led
by men like Luke Cottrell</i>."

6
00:01:46,133 --> 00:01:49,932
"<i>Left a wake of ruin burning and
plundering ranches and homes</i>."

7
00:01:51,238 --> 00:01:53,244
"<i>Riding across the great flat plain</i>."

8
00:01:53,637 --> 00:01:56,298
"<i>With gun and torch they
pillaged the countryside</i>."

9
00:01:56,839 --> 00:01:58,276
"<i>In the name of the Union Army</i>."

10
00:02:04,134 --> 00:02:08,335
"<i>And against the Texas sky rose
the slow dust of wagon trains</i>."

11
00:02:09,034 --> 00:02:12,070
"<i>Settlers driven from the
land by the fury of war</i>."

12
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,078
Looks like we lost more than our cows.

13
00:02:45,386 --> 00:02:47,449
Nobody but a Yankee would
do a thing like this.

14
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:50,489
Somebody around here don't like us.

15
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:52,354
Kip.

16
00:02:53,474 --> 00:02:54,207
Kip.

17
00:02:55,705 --> 00:02:57,035
They must have been watching.

18
00:02:57,561 --> 00:02:59,576
They saw you and the men
ride off after the herd.

19
00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:01,634
They came to all the ranches that night.

20
00:03:02,072 --> 00:03:03,691
They dragged off all they could carry.

21
00:03:04,089 --> 00:03:05,670
Stole the horses. Burned the houses.

22
00:03:06,021 --> 00:03:07,208
Who did it?
- Cottrell.

23
00:03:07,549 --> 00:03:08,994
Luke Cottrell and his guerrillas.

24
00:03:10,472 --> 00:03:12,594
Bronco. I want you to take
good care of Deborah.

25
00:03:12,957 --> 00:03:14,316
What are you going to do, Kip?

26
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,157
Your horse's alright?
- Sure. They'll pull to Hampton.

27
00:03:17,617 --> 00:03:20,174
Where you going? I want to go with you.
- Deb needs you with her.

28
00:03:20,752 --> 00:03:21,983
Where are you going, Kip?

29
00:03:22,727 --> 00:03:25,300
Brownsville.
- That's Union headquarters now.

30
00:03:26,112 --> 00:03:27,225
And Cottrell's.

31
00:03:37,788 --> 00:03:40,289
Don't do it, Kip.
Come to Edenton with us.

32
00:03:40,862 --> 00:03:43,020
Leave our land and let them
burn us out and do nothing?

33
00:03:43,251 --> 00:03:44,581
They've burned out all of us.

34
00:03:44,935 --> 00:03:46,726
Finding Cottrell won't bring it back.

35
00:03:49,026 --> 00:03:51,462
Lee, tell him you won't go with him.
Tell him not to do it.

36
00:03:51,957 --> 00:03:53,917
The three of us been together
a long stretch, Deb.

37
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:55,414
Charlie?

38
00:03:56,275 --> 00:03:58,823
I wouldn't mind getting a look
at Cottrell myself right now.

39
00:03:59,213 --> 00:04:02,060
It isn't Cottrell I'm thinking of.
It's the three of you.

40
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:04,853
You came out here and made
something out of the land.

41
00:04:05,346 --> 00:04:07,801
There were troubles then too
but they didn't turn you to hate.

42
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:09,936
Building Three Bell kept you together.

43
00:04:10,662 --> 00:04:12,427
This can only end by
splitting you apart.

44
00:04:13,036 --> 00:04:14,644
Don't you see? Don't go.

45
00:04:15,657 --> 00:04:17,137
We're going to Brownsville, Deb.

46
00:04:19,683 --> 00:04:20,867
What about me, Kip?

47
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:22,874
You asked me to marry you.

48
00:04:23,102 --> 00:04:25,243
We made all kinds of plans.
What happens to them now?

49
00:04:25,576 --> 00:04:26,592
Nothing's changed.

50
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,116
We'll all be coming back.
Maybe sooner than you think.

51
00:04:32,504 --> 00:04:34,841
Kip is right.
Edenton is the place for you now.

52
00:04:39,216 --> 00:04:41,007
I'm afraid we're going
to Brownsville, Deb.

53
00:04:42,844 --> 00:04:44,940
We're pulling out.
You had better go now.

54
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,271
Hold it there.

55
00:06:00,067 --> 00:06:02,074
What are you carrying?
- Contraband.

56
00:06:02,589 --> 00:06:04,798
Cannonballs and used rifle bullets.

57
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:08,127
I grow them on my ranch when
nobody is looking at me.

58
00:06:08,647 --> 00:06:11,921
I wouldn't throw that word 'contraband'
around so free in these parts.

59
00:06:12,465 --> 00:06:14,387
I've seen men shot for
much less than that.

60
00:06:15,579 --> 00:06:16,595
He's carrying hay.

61
00:06:16,925 --> 00:06:18,284
Alright. Let him through, Cal.

62
00:06:19,124 --> 00:06:20,083
Go ahead, Reb.

63
00:06:20,576 --> 00:06:22,674
And next time save
your jokes for Jeff Davis.

64
00:06:52,266 --> 00:06:54,024
<i>We're Union to a man, sir</i>.

65
00:06:54,412 --> 00:06:57,260
<i>Yankee doodle never fails
when he decides to try, sir</i>.

66
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:01,171
<i>We'll lick the pants off Johnny Reb,
so have another ride, sir</i>.

67
00:07:01,484 --> 00:07:03,192
<i>We'll have another ride, sir</i>.

68
00:07:03,563 --> 00:07:06,329
<i>Yankee doodle does as
well any other dancer</i>.

69
00:07:06,931 --> 00:07:10,353
<i>And like the ladies, he is
brave and Union to a man, sir</i>.

70
00:07:10,781 --> 00:07:13,769
<i>Yankee doodle never fails
when he decides to try, sir</i>.

71
00:07:14,248 --> 00:07:18,055
<i>We'll lick the pants off Johnny Reb,
so have another ride, sir</i>.

72
00:07:43,374 --> 00:07:44,189
Hello Jake.

73
00:07:45,016 --> 00:07:46,003
How are you, Kip?

74
00:07:46,555 --> 00:07:47,246
Lee?

75
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,587
Hello Charlie.
- A full house today.

76
00:07:49,997 --> 00:07:50,612
Yep.

77
00:07:50,848 --> 00:07:52,092
I don't see Luke Cottrell.

78
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:53,185
Luke?

79
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:54,776
Cottrell? Oh.

80
00:07:55,769 --> 00:07:56,813
He's been in today?

81
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,415
I don't think he was
in today but I can ask.

82
00:07:59,761 --> 00:08:00,405
Jake.

83
00:08:01,274 --> 00:08:02,461
Does he usually come by?

84
00:08:03,341 --> 00:08:03,956
Who?

85
00:08:04,613 --> 00:08:05,371
Cottrell.

86
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:07,957
He comes by.

87
00:08:08,301 --> 00:08:09,031
Sure.

88
00:08:10,334 --> 00:08:11,731
A man gets thirsty, don't he?

89
00:08:13,467 --> 00:08:14,082
Kip.

90
00:08:14,358 --> 00:08:16,804
Please don't start anything.
I don't want any trouble in the place.

91
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:19,560
Don't worry, Jake.
There ain't going to be any trouble.

92
00:08:21,717 --> 00:08:23,248
Can I buy you a drink while we wait?

93
00:08:24,434 --> 00:08:26,622
Some other time.
If it's just the same to you.

94
00:08:27,551 --> 00:08:29,032
Rouge. Rouge, come here.

95
00:08:30,394 --> 00:08:32,393
Sing Yankee doodle again. Sign anything.

96
00:08:32,976 --> 00:08:33,833
But sing.

97
00:08:39,701 --> 00:08:40,345
Boys.

98
00:09:26,252 --> 00:09:26,981
Whiskey.

99
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:32,193
Our brave guerrilla allies.

100
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,190
Hello Cottrell.

101
00:10:42,737 --> 00:10:43,718
You celebrate?

102
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:46,898
You ain't crazy enough to
start anything here, Davis.

103
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:48,702
I'm not starting anything.

104
00:10:49,088 --> 00:10:50,894
You figure on making me draw first, huh?

105
00:10:52,187 --> 00:10:52,859
Maybe.

106
00:10:58,804 --> 00:11:00,506
Then the three of you
start pumping lead.

107
00:11:01,088 --> 00:11:03,342
No. They're patient boys.
They will wait their turn.

108
00:11:03,898 --> 00:11:05,007
If you get past me.

109
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:08,890
You got a name for being
pretty fast on the draw, Davis.

110
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:10,546
I'm still living.

111
00:11:11,061 --> 00:11:12,792
But I've heard them
say Charlie is faster.

112
00:11:13,736 --> 00:11:14,380
Yeah?

113
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:17,463
What about him?

114
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,867
He outdraws both of you?

115
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:21,980
I don't put bullets in my guns.
I just carry them for ballast.

116
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:28,927
If you boys are looking for a fight
you'll have to fight each other.

117
00:11:29,817 --> 00:11:30,775
I ain't drawing.

118
00:11:32,969 --> 00:11:34,374
Pick up your gun, Cottrell.

119
00:13:08,171 --> 00:13:09,158
Listen, Cottrell.

120
00:13:09,898 --> 00:13:11,457
Get out of Texas and don't come back.

121
00:13:26,986 --> 00:13:29,696
You've earned yourself a drink, mister.
I'd like to buy you one.

122
00:13:30,468 --> 00:13:31,741
I don't drink with Yankees.

123
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,085
Easy does it, Kip.

124
00:13:38,379 --> 00:13:39,983
See, Jake? There wasn't any trouble.

125
00:14:03,892 --> 00:14:05,108
Alright, you border rats.

126
00:14:05,521 --> 00:14:06,901
Get in on the winning side.

127
00:14:07,607 --> 00:14:10,181
If there's a man among you
he'll join up with the best ..

128
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:12,602
Fighting force west of the Mississippi.

129
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:13,987
Come on, step up.

130
00:14:14,494 --> 00:14:15,939
Sign your name or make your mark.

131
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,068
And ride to victory with
the Seventh Cavalry.

132
00:14:19,772 --> 00:14:22,116
Yeah. Join the army and steal cattle.

133
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,274
Say, you look strong
enough to carry a gun.

134
00:14:25,847 --> 00:14:27,037
I already got one.

135
00:14:27,585 --> 00:14:30,407
But it's got a funny habit of
shooting only one way. North.

136
00:14:31,613 --> 00:14:32,770
A Johnny Reb, huh?

137
00:14:33,566 --> 00:14:35,419
Or maybe you're too scared to fight.

138
00:14:36,422 --> 00:14:38,264
Easy does it, Lee. Easy does it.

139
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:48,135
How much more of this
do you think I can take?

140
00:14:48,468 --> 00:14:50,296
For months now we've
tried to raise a stake.

141
00:14:50,738 --> 00:14:53,309
We ain't got the stake and I'm sick
of looking at Union soldiers.

142
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:55,056
Living with them. Easting with them.

143
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,747
And marching through my dreams.

144
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:59,688
Why not march something else through
your dreams? Something like blondes?

145
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:02,029
Come on, let's get a drink.
- I'm going to Edenton.

146
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:04,579
What for? There's nothing in
Edenton but more soldiers.

147
00:15:05,053 --> 00:15:06,669
Yeah. But they're Confederate soldiers.

148
00:15:06,934 --> 00:15:08,064
I am going to sign up.

149
00:15:08,447 --> 00:15:09,547
You, a soldier-boy?

150
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,500
Stripes on your sleeve? Yes, sir.
No sir. Saluting every minute?

151
00:15:13,082 --> 00:15:14,784
You sure that's what
you want to do, Lee?

152
00:15:15,189 --> 00:15:16,119
Yeah. I'm sure.

153
00:15:16,622 --> 00:15:19,424
I ain't got nothing against shooting.
Why change clothes to do it?

154
00:15:20,903 --> 00:15:23,533
Maybe he's right.
Maybe all three of us ought to join up.

155
00:15:23,917 --> 00:15:24,818
Wait a minute.

156
00:15:25,035 --> 00:15:26,088
No. Not you two.

157
00:15:26,489 --> 00:15:29,193
You wouldn't be in the army five minutes
before they'd hang the both of you.

158
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:31,177
Inciting to riot. Striking an officer.

159
00:15:31,575 --> 00:15:32,844
Disobedience to orders.

160
00:15:33,283 --> 00:15:34,737
Wearing the uniform improperly.

161
00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:36,139
What about you?

162
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:38,094
Well, it's different with me. You know.

163
00:15:38,659 --> 00:15:39,961
It means we got to break up.

164
00:15:40,969 --> 00:15:42,277
We never broke up before.

165
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,650
We've never had a war like this before.

166
00:15:46,032 --> 00:15:46,904
Alright, Lee.

167
00:15:47,245 --> 00:15:49,257
You're the only one who
knows what you ought to do.

168
00:15:50,707 --> 00:15:51,351
Well.

169
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:53,966
So long, Kip.
- Good riding, Lee.

170
00:15:54,961 --> 00:15:56,434
So long, Charlie.
- So long, Lee.

171
00:16:03,596 --> 00:16:05,824
What's Lee supposed to do now?
Turn in his bell?

172
00:16:06,303 --> 00:16:07,404
Quit joking, Charlie.

173
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,433
He is my friend too.

174
00:16:11,065 --> 00:16:12,226
We still need a stake.

175
00:16:12,797 --> 00:16:15,008
Maybe I can win a herd
at Jake's card tables.

176
00:16:24,726 --> 00:16:25,598
Hello cowboy.

177
00:16:26,588 --> 00:16:27,489
How do, ma'am.

178
00:16:28,677 --> 00:16:30,036
I've been wondering about you.

179
00:16:31,326 --> 00:16:33,402
What does a cowboy do
when he runs out of cows?

180
00:16:34,124 --> 00:16:35,655
I've wondered the same thing myself.

181
00:16:36,377 --> 00:16:38,516
I got fifty dollars looking for a job.

182
00:16:39,513 --> 00:16:40,557
What kind of a job?

183
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:42,311
Driving that wagon.

184
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:45,192
High pay for a muleskinner.

185
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,747
Where you aim on driving it? St Louis?

186
00:16:48,206 --> 00:16:49,353
Just to Point Isabel.

187
00:16:49,873 --> 00:16:50,745
Point Isabel?

188
00:16:51,174 --> 00:16:52,607
That is confederate territory.

189
00:16:53,196 --> 00:16:54,791
What is in your wagon?
- Furniture.

190
00:16:55,918 --> 00:16:57,916
I brought some fine
things into this town.

191
00:16:58,932 --> 00:17:00,920
It's getting a little rough
here so I'm moving out.

192
00:17:01,628 --> 00:17:03,359
Every stick of it came
over from the East.

193
00:17:03,867 --> 00:17:05,532
That chaise there. It came from France.

194
00:17:06,174 --> 00:17:07,093
It's all mine.

195
00:17:11,236 --> 00:17:12,509
You haven't been listening.

196
00:17:12,923 --> 00:17:15,451
I've been wondering about you
ever since I drifted into town.

197
00:17:16,593 --> 00:17:18,495
That's a healthy color
you got in your cheeks.

198
00:17:20,797 --> 00:17:21,469
Rouge.

199
00:17:22,111 --> 00:17:24,014
I thought for a minute it
was the Texas climate.

200
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:26,547
Even Texas needs a little help.

201
00:17:27,019 --> 00:17:27,834
Just rouge.

202
00:17:28,314 --> 00:17:29,673
Is that how you got your name?

203
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:30,485
No.

204
00:17:31,178 --> 00:17:33,081
It's because I came from
Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

205
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:37,403
You wouldn't call a lady 'Baton'.

206
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,066
No.

207
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,022
I reckon not.

208
00:17:45,512 --> 00:17:46,156
Well.

209
00:17:46,503 --> 00:17:48,757
For fifty dollars I'm willing to
believe it's all mahogany.

210
00:18:25,783 --> 00:18:27,197
Holy smoke. Look at that.

211
00:19:03,698 --> 00:19:05,481
Our forces have occupied this area.

212
00:19:05,969 --> 00:19:08,876
To stop the traffic in smuggled war
supplies from Mexico to the rebels.

213
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:10,737
And I intend to stop it.

214
00:19:11,502 --> 00:19:12,829
Now I ask you once more.

215
00:19:14,165 --> 00:19:15,066
Who hired you?

216
00:19:15,622 --> 00:19:17,095
I've told you all I know, Colonel.

217
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:23,411
Unless you tell us who involved you in
this you may see yourself shot as a spy.

218
00:19:28,215 --> 00:19:30,353
Alright, Billings.
Take him down to the stockade.

219
00:19:59,975 --> 00:20:00,704
Get out.

220
00:20:03,099 --> 00:20:05,384
What's the idea?
I get shot trying to escape?

221
00:20:19,647 --> 00:20:20,582
Hello cowboy.

222
00:20:22,361 --> 00:20:23,999
What's going on?
- Any objections?

223
00:20:24,771 --> 00:20:26,809
I got objections to furniture
that shoots bullets.

224
00:20:27,336 --> 00:20:28,858
You knew that mahogany was loaded.

225
00:20:29,248 --> 00:20:30,092
Maybe I did.

226
00:20:30,549 --> 00:20:32,766
What about those marshals?
- At heart, they're southerners.

227
00:20:33,133 --> 00:20:34,491
For a hundred dollars of gold.

228
00:20:34,855 --> 00:20:36,014
You still owe me fifty.

229
00:20:36,447 --> 00:20:37,892
You never did deliver the chaise.

230
00:20:40,926 --> 00:20:42,514
You still looking for a stake, cowboy?

231
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:44,855
You got some more furniture?
- Lots of it.

232
00:20:46,436 --> 00:20:47,766
Some very interesting pieces.

233
00:20:48,964 --> 00:20:50,557
Maybe even enough to furnish a ranch.

234
00:20:51,629 --> 00:20:54,159
The chairs on our ranch weren't
much but the cows didn't mind.

235
00:20:54,823 --> 00:20:55,839
What was it worth?

236
00:20:56,286 --> 00:20:58,160
About fifteen thousand
when they burned us out.

237
00:20:58,617 --> 00:21:00,004
You can make it back in a year.

238
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:01,056
Where?

239
00:21:01,273 --> 00:21:02,520
Across the river with me.

240
00:21:03,021 --> 00:21:04,637
You really don't have much of a choice.

241
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:06,842
Are we going?

242
00:21:11,633 --> 00:21:12,362
Charlie.

243
00:21:12,657 --> 00:21:15,204
Just in case a hundred
dollars wasn't enough.

244
00:21:16,103 --> 00:21:18,063
Two bullets would be cheaper.
- Save your bullets.

245
00:21:18,284 --> 00:21:19,815
You'll need them where you're going.

246
00:21:20,769 --> 00:21:21,785
Come on. Climb in.

247
00:21:24,167 --> 00:21:24,782
Sam.

248
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:26,055
Charlie.

249
00:22:08,012 --> 00:22:09,028
Look at this town.

250
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:11,177
One more war and it'll
be another New Orleans.

251
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:14,648
There's enough stuff piled up here to
blow Brownsville into the panhandle.

252
00:22:15,285 --> 00:22:17,976
You're looking at the supply depot
for the whole Confederate army.

253
00:22:18,465 --> 00:22:20,311
Matamoras is the back door to the south.

254
00:22:21,078 --> 00:22:22,119
Who owns all this?

255
00:22:22,336 --> 00:22:24,162
Brugnon bought it. Papa Brugnon.

256
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:27,136
Buys it in Europe and sells it
here to anybody with the cash.

257
00:22:28,334 --> 00:22:30,788
And nerve enough to run
it across the border.

258
00:22:31,228 --> 00:22:34,831
There enough floaters in this town to
double every gun hand west of Pecos.

259
00:22:35,214 --> 00:22:36,115
Go ahead, Kip.

260
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:40,059
You two go and talk to Papa and by the
time you come out we'll have an outfit.

261
00:22:40,438 --> 00:22:41,454
Let's get started.

262
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,212
Rouge.

263
00:22:53,203 --> 00:22:54,222
Baby. Ma petite.

264
00:22:54,629 --> 00:22:55,387
Papa.

265
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:57,809
Sit down. Sit down.

266
00:22:58,632 --> 00:23:00,740
You look hungry. When did you eat last?

267
00:23:01,192 --> 00:23:01,921
Lobster?

268
00:23:02,276 --> 00:23:03,915
Business first, Papa. Lobster later.

269
00:23:04,252 --> 00:23:05,010
Business.

270
00:23:05,227 --> 00:23:05,985
Business.

271
00:23:06,483 --> 00:23:08,235
I've formed a new partnership, Papa.

272
00:23:08,822 --> 00:23:09,623
Mr Davis.

273
00:23:10,321 --> 00:23:11,480
Monsieur Henri Brugnon.

274
00:23:12,311 --> 00:23:13,334
A foolish man.

275
00:23:14,773 --> 00:23:17,105
Alas, Monsieur.
You come to me at the wrong time.

276
00:23:17,545 --> 00:23:20,072
There isn't a sou of
merchandise in my warehouse.

277
00:23:20,464 --> 00:23:21,880
Who's buying in such quantities?

278
00:23:22,273 --> 00:23:23,944
I have new customers, Cherie.

279
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,845
Let them wait.
- I'm obligated, Cherie.

280
00:23:27,344 --> 00:23:29,358
They sound more like
partners than customers.

281
00:23:30,173 --> 00:23:30,931
Partners?

282
00:23:31,477 --> 00:23:32,149
Never.

283
00:23:32,667 --> 00:23:33,833
I have no partners.

284
00:23:34,485 --> 00:23:37,329
Then you'll always have
something for friends, eh Papa?

285
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:40,730
Old friends.

286
00:23:41,635 --> 00:23:43,091
Whatever you want, Cherie.

287
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,684
Whenever I have it.

288
00:23:45,834 --> 00:23:47,374
Any more in the warehouse, Brugnon?

289
00:23:48,099 --> 00:23:49,311
Monsieur Cottrell.

290
00:23:50,284 --> 00:23:51,729
Is this your new cash customer?

291
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:52,941
Yeah.

292
00:23:53,545 --> 00:23:55,991
Henri and me have been doing some
nice pieces of business together.

293
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,378
Ain't we, Henri?

294
00:23:57,595 --> 00:23:59,633
It's been a pleasure, Monsieur Cottrell.

295
00:24:00,497 --> 00:24:02,285
You don't care which
side you're on, do you.

296
00:24:02,787 --> 00:24:03,717
I like it here.

297
00:24:04,549 --> 00:24:07,468
There's no army around making rules
about how you're supposed to kill a man.

298
00:24:09,695 --> 00:24:10,367
Bucky.

299
00:24:12,454 --> 00:24:13,679
This ain't Texas, Davis.

300
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:17,357
Go on back to hustling cows
and keep out of my business.

301
00:24:18,026 --> 00:24:20,011
I'm not asking for
your advice, Cottrell.

302
00:24:21,124 --> 00:24:22,249
I told you before.

303
00:24:22,779 --> 00:24:24,521
You can draw first any time, any place.

304
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:29,178
Why should I get mad at you, Davis?

305
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:31,830
I took your advice and
got out of Texas, didn't I?

306
00:24:32,782 --> 00:24:34,570
You take my advice and
get out of Matamoras.

307
00:24:36,181 --> 00:24:38,016
Keep hustling cows. It's a lot safer.

308
00:24:39,481 --> 00:24:42,002
Go on, Henri.
Finish your lobster before it gets cold.

309
00:25:00,387 --> 00:25:01,145
Hey, Kip.

310
00:25:10,533 --> 00:25:12,898
Are those the men you lined up?
- Matamoras's best.

311
00:25:15,123 --> 00:25:16,770
You. What is your name?
- Jim Morland.

312
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:19,008
Can you handle a gun?
- Sure.

313
00:25:19,264 --> 00:25:21,066
Any objection to
shooting it if necessary?

314
00:25:21,481 --> 00:25:22,468
What's a gun for?

315
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:23,499
Alright.

316
00:25:23,887 --> 00:25:25,149
You?
- Ted Johnson.

317
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:27,726
Can you ride a horse?
- I was born on one.

318
00:25:29,014 --> 00:25:29,743
And you?

319
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:31,370
[ Spanish language ]

320
00:25:33,881 --> 00:25:35,347
A muleskinner, eh?
- Best.

321
00:25:35,861 --> 00:25:36,819
Alright, Manuel.

322
00:25:37,121 --> 00:25:37,965
Slim Hansen.

323
00:25:42,075 --> 00:25:43,270
You a Texan?
- Yeah.

324
00:25:43,831 --> 00:25:44,675
I'm a Texan.

325
00:25:45,568 --> 00:25:47,356
Are you as good with
that knife as you look?

326
00:25:48,062 --> 00:25:48,906
Good enough.

327
00:25:49,718 --> 00:25:50,835
I've seen you around.

328
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:51,952
Maybe.

329
00:25:52,334 --> 00:25:53,779
Weren't you riding with Cottrell?

330
00:25:54,055 --> 00:25:55,930
For a while. I didn't like it much.

331
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:57,719
Get out.

332
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:01,204
He hired me. You didn't.

333
00:26:02,487 --> 00:26:03,760
Who is running this outfit?

334
00:26:04,305 --> 00:26:06,467
He said he quit Cottrell.
We can't be choosy, Kip.

335
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:07,790
I don't trust him.

336
00:26:08,854 --> 00:26:10,645
I'd say he's alright. I picked him.

337
00:26:11,723 --> 00:26:12,767
Well, pick another.

338
00:26:14,968 --> 00:26:15,869
I want him in.

339
00:26:19,672 --> 00:26:20,401
Alright.

340
00:26:21,211 --> 00:26:22,141
You've got him.

341
00:26:25,315 --> 00:26:27,532
That's a fine band of
cut-throats he picked out.

342
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,686
We got our outfit. What about your end?

343
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:32,101
My end?
- Yeah. Brugnon.

344
00:26:32,645 --> 00:26:34,147
Can we take his word he'll deliver?

345
00:26:34,766 --> 00:26:36,649
It will take a few months
but he'll deliver.

346
00:26:37,226 --> 00:26:37,927
For me.

347
00:26:39,592 --> 00:26:41,035
Can you get it through the lines?

348
00:26:41,817 --> 00:26:42,918
We'll get it through.

349
00:26:46,063 --> 00:26:47,708
You've a lot of confidence, haven't you.

350
00:26:48,787 --> 00:26:50,675
I hope it carries you
600 miles to Edenton.

351
00:26:51,812 --> 00:26:54,697
You know, the Yankee patrols don't ride
the river just to look at the scenery.

352
00:26:55,366 --> 00:26:57,726
We ain't going to spend too much
time looking at scenery either.

353
00:27:05,235 --> 00:27:05,850
Sam.

354
00:28:15,725 --> 00:28:17,763
Is this where we cross the border?
- That's right.

355
00:28:18,578 --> 00:28:19,450
See anything?

356
00:28:19,769 --> 00:28:21,674
Nothing but lizards and tired rattlers.

357
00:28:22,141 --> 00:28:24,097
This Texan sun is too
hot for Yankees anyhow.

358
00:28:24,366 --> 00:28:25,839
They're all back in Jake's saloon.

359
00:28:26,217 --> 00:28:28,248
Don't be too sure.
We ain't at Edenton yet.

360
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:30,930
Come on. Move 'em up.

361
00:31:08,852 --> 00:31:12,969
I always knew there would be one good
reason for letting you go to Edenton.

362
00:31:13,215 --> 00:31:14,374
Now I know what it was.

363
00:31:14,591 --> 00:31:17,452
We aim to please, and nothing pleases
us more than tangling with Cottrell.

364
00:31:17,788 --> 00:31:19,118
What's doing in Edenton, Lee?

365
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:22,164
Anything more interesting than
broken-down cowboys turned sergeant?

366
00:31:22,784 --> 00:31:24,686
Everybody is there. The Jasons, Bronco.

367
00:31:25,065 --> 00:31:25,680
Deb?

368
00:31:26,363 --> 00:31:28,656
Yes. She's there too.
She's nursing at the hospital.

369
00:31:29,069 --> 00:31:29,884
How is she?

370
00:31:30,341 --> 00:31:31,417
She is fine, Kip.

371
00:31:33,606 --> 00:31:35,630
Are you in charge of this wagon train?
- We are.

372
00:31:36,166 --> 00:31:37,827
It's lucky for you we were on patrol.

373
00:31:38,328 --> 00:31:40,341
Alright, Sergeant.
Let's get them to Edenton now.

374
00:31:40,786 --> 00:31:41,544
Yes, sir.

375
00:31:42,343 --> 00:31:44,624
Yes, sir. No, sir.
You salute real pretty, Lee.

376
00:31:45,063 --> 00:31:46,499
You run guns real pretty too.

377
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,688
Sergeant, get unloaded.
- Very well, sir.

378
00:32:33,483 --> 00:32:35,586
Alright men. Get on those wagons.
Start breaking it up.

379
00:32:36,199 --> 00:32:37,501
Where is that hospital, Lee?

380
00:32:38,591 --> 00:32:40,207
Go on down the road. You can't miss it.

381
00:32:40,827 --> 00:32:41,528
Thanks.

382
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:49,758
I knowed it. I knowed it.

383
00:32:50,151 --> 00:32:52,509
I seen them cowpunchers.
I sniffed that saddle leather.

384
00:32:52,905 --> 00:32:55,573
Wait until Debbie hears.
- She won't hear, Bronco. She will see.

385
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,377
Go and trade brands with Charlie.

386
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:58,748
Wait a minute, Kip.

387
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:01,148
There's one thing we
got to settle right now.

388
00:33:01,524 --> 00:33:03,284
I'm going with you on that next trip.

389
00:33:03,757 --> 00:33:05,703
I know that border like
I know my own hand.

390
00:33:06,064 --> 00:33:07,841
I can drive a team like nobody.

391
00:33:08,298 --> 00:33:10,894
Alright, Bronco.
Go and tell Charlie you're hired.

392
00:33:11,351 --> 00:33:12,075
Yes!

393
00:33:19,071 --> 00:33:19,686
Deb.

394
00:33:19,934 --> 00:33:21,650
Oh Lee. You're back.

395
00:33:22,512 --> 00:33:24,828
I was so worried.
- Guess again. It ain't Lee this time.

396
00:33:25,488 --> 00:33:27,116
Oh Kip. Kip, you did come.

397
00:33:27,476 --> 00:33:28,468
You did come.

398
00:33:29,468 --> 00:33:32,000
You didn't think I'd let a couple of
armies stand in the way, did you?

399
00:33:32,893 --> 00:33:35,638
You should have let me know you were
coming. I'd have got you a room to stay.

400
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,062
I know. Jason's attic.

401
00:33:38,501 --> 00:33:40,089
You don't mind climbing a few flights?

402
00:33:40,689 --> 00:33:41,905
But I ain't staring, Deb.

403
00:33:42,514 --> 00:33:43,605
You're not staying?

404
00:33:43,899 --> 00:33:46,508
Me and Charlie brought a load of guns
and powder through the Union line.

405
00:33:46,985 --> 00:33:48,283
We are pulling out tonight.

406
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,967
I didn't know.

407
00:33:52,696 --> 00:33:54,341
I thought you came to Edenton because ..

408
00:33:54,558 --> 00:33:57,352
Don't you think I missed you?
You don't think I wanted it this way?

409
00:33:57,747 --> 00:34:00,320
Me down in Matamoras and you up here.
- Then stay here.

410
00:34:01,217 --> 00:34:02,404
Stay here for what, Deb?

411
00:34:02,621 --> 00:34:04,841
Hang my thumbs in my belt?
There is money in running guns.

412
00:34:05,192 --> 00:34:06,624
Money to buy cattle and rebuild.

413
00:34:06,952 --> 00:34:08,825
They burned us out but
we ain't staying burned.

414
00:34:09,111 --> 00:34:10,641
The ranch isn't so important to Lee.

415
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:12,541
Lee is different to me.

416
00:34:13,052 --> 00:34:16,190
No-one knows how long the war will last.
We cannot wait forever, Kip.

417
00:34:16,565 --> 00:34:18,235
Not thinking, not feeling. Not living.

418
00:34:18,892 --> 00:34:20,079
I'm no good to you, Deb.

419
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:22,886
To myself or anyone else until
I get back on that ranch again.

420
00:34:29,566 --> 00:34:31,182
It wasn't the ranch I wanted to marry.

421
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,736
I'll see you before we pull out.

422
00:34:38,143 --> 00:34:38,758
Yes.

423
00:34:49,124 --> 00:34:51,477
That just about does it, Sergeant.
- Alright, Danny.

424
00:34:52,196 --> 00:34:53,068
All unloaded?

425
00:34:53,303 --> 00:34:55,206
Yeah. Nothing like doing
business with the army.

426
00:34:55,423 --> 00:34:57,897
They'd buy the buttons off your shirt
if they came in packing boxes.

427
00:34:58,467 --> 00:34:59,848
It figures. Split three ways.

428
00:35:00,516 --> 00:35:01,331
Three ways?

429
00:35:01,723 --> 00:35:02,367
Yeah.

430
00:35:02,584 --> 00:35:04,106
You're not figuring me in on it?

431
00:35:04,544 --> 00:35:07,632
It all goes back to Three Bell.
Last I heard that was a 3-way deal.

432
00:35:08,881 --> 00:35:11,388
Still wearing that bell on your spurs.
Good enough for me.

433
00:35:12,523 --> 00:35:16,271
And if he got shot crossing the river
you two would have to commit suicide?

434
00:35:17,027 --> 00:35:18,357
Is that supposed to be funny?

435
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:22,098
Before we start dividing we'd
better get something to divide.

436
00:35:22,612 --> 00:35:23,370
Sergeant.

437
00:35:25,449 --> 00:35:26,922
Supplies all checked?
- Yes, sir.

438
00:35:27,849 --> 00:35:30,956
The Confederate Army is grateful, sir.
- We'll run all you can take, Captain.

439
00:35:31,318 --> 00:35:34,635
You keep the supplies coming and we'll
have enough soon to retake Brownsville.

440
00:35:35,574 --> 00:35:37,190
Pay the men off, Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.

441
00:35:39,576 --> 00:35:41,468
You heard what he said.
Pay the men off.

442
00:35:41,932 --> 00:35:43,930
Come on, boys.
Let me show you where we keep it.

443
00:35:45,136 --> 00:35:47,479
You can't accuse this outfit
of confiscating anything.

444
00:35:47,924 --> 00:35:48,919
We pay in full.

445
00:35:52,326 --> 00:35:53,227
There you are.

446
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:04,129
When did they start packing up
confederate money in bales?

447
00:36:06,642 --> 00:36:08,069
That's good old Texas cotton.

448
00:36:08,359 --> 00:36:09,947
Legal tender for government purchases.

449
00:36:10,164 --> 00:36:11,437
All you do is haul it away.

450
00:36:11,778 --> 00:36:13,509
No wonder you didn't
want to be a partner.

451
00:36:13,726 --> 00:36:14,916
Why? Don't you like it?

452
00:36:15,226 --> 00:36:17,427
What are we supposed to do with it?
Stuff it in our ears?

453
00:36:17,973 --> 00:36:21,145
That Louisiana crush of yours. I had an
idea she didn't know what she was doing.

454
00:36:21,502 --> 00:36:23,519
How would she like two of
these bales in her bustle?

455
00:36:23,907 --> 00:36:24,694
Gentlemen.

456
00:36:25,107 --> 00:36:28,457
The quartermaster told me I might find
someone about here with cotton for sale.

457
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,122
You mean you buy cotton for money?
- Yes, indeed.

458
00:36:32,872 --> 00:36:34,145
My name is Cecil Middleton.

459
00:36:34,616 --> 00:36:37,678
I represent the firm of Cartwright
& Bonesteel of Manchester, England.

460
00:36:38,485 --> 00:36:39,219
We pay.

461
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:40,812
With British pounds.

462
00:36:41,209 --> 00:36:43,026
Mister, you just bought
yourself some cotton.

463
00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:44,259
That is wonderful.

464
00:36:44,974 --> 00:36:47,631
Let's see the British pounds
or do you pay in tea leave?

465
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,542
No, no. Gold pounds.

466
00:36:50,256 --> 00:36:51,802
Perhaps you don't quite understand.

467
00:36:52,937 --> 00:36:54,525
I shall be glad to pay for the cotton.

468
00:36:55,082 --> 00:36:56,183
When it is delivered.

469
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:57,826
In Matamoras, Mexico.

470
00:37:38,139 --> 00:37:39,109
Hello cowboy.

471
00:37:39,981 --> 00:37:41,254
How is the cotton business?

472
00:37:42,248 --> 00:37:43,454
I ain't so sure yet.

473
00:37:44,449 --> 00:37:46,805
I got wagons stretched down
the road for about a mile.

474
00:37:47,351 --> 00:37:48,967
Now, what are we going to do with them?

475
00:37:55,917 --> 00:37:57,546
Hello Charlie. Nice work.

476
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:02,229
Have any trouble getting through?
- Yeah. Coming back.

477
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:05,896
We sighted a Yankee patrol but made
it across the river before they did.

478
00:38:06,254 --> 00:38:08,960
They were probably laughing
so hard they couldn't fight.

479
00:38:09,588 --> 00:38:11,605
Why didn't you tell us they
pay off with this stuff?

480
00:38:11,878 --> 00:38:13,237
What's the matter with cotton?

481
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:15,091
You can run it up into petticoats.

482
00:38:15,572 --> 00:38:17,732
Or maybe you'd like a little
cotton doily for your horse?

483
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:21,635
Listen. All we've got is the promise of
some Britisher we may never see again.

484
00:38:22,331 --> 00:38:23,004
Maybe.

485
00:38:32,761 --> 00:38:34,791
Cecil, old chap. They're here.
- Good.

486
00:38:35,249 --> 00:38:36,808
So gentlemen, you brought the cotton.

487
00:38:37,183 --> 00:38:38,427
I have the British pounds.

488
00:38:39,261 --> 00:38:41,837
And may I say your partner
drives a hard bargain.

489
00:38:42,522 --> 00:38:44,081
Come on in. We'll settle the account.

490
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:49,361
So, she doesn't know
what she's doing, huh?

491
00:39:07,416 --> 00:39:08,363
Good old Cecil.

492
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:11,598
What do you think he's going
to do with all that cotton?

493
00:39:12,674 --> 00:39:15,412
For the price you got him to pay he
ought to cash it with his gold dust.

494
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:18,097
Did I do alright?

495
00:39:18,511 --> 00:39:19,424
You did fine.

496
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:22,226
I am a good little girl.

497
00:39:23,324 --> 00:39:24,154
Very good.

498
00:39:24,552 --> 00:39:25,544
Very very good.

499
00:39:27,764 --> 00:39:30,162
Up in Edenton they're talking
about retaking Brownsville.

500
00:39:33,726 --> 00:39:35,048
[ Singing ]

501
00:39:41,292 --> 00:39:42,323
Too much love.

502
00:39:45,646 --> 00:39:47,573
<i>Can make you unhappy</i>.

503
00:39:49,211 --> 00:39:51,003
<i>Too much love</i>.

504
00:39:51,763 --> 00:39:53,752
<i>Can leave you alone</i>.

505
00:39:55,627 --> 00:39:59,516
<i>Too many times I've had it happen</i>.

506
00:40:00,445 --> 00:40:02,508
<i>Love caught me napping</i>.

507
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:05,385
<i>Now I am alone</i>.

508
00:40:09,043 --> 00:40:12,980
<i>Too much time is wasted in waiting</i>.

509
00:40:14,635 --> 00:40:16,298
<i>For the one</i>.

510
00:40:17,586 --> 00:40:19,812
<i>Who will call you his own</i>.

511
00:40:21,915 --> 00:40:23,545
<i>That is why my heart</i>.

512
00:40:24,556 --> 00:40:27,695
<i>Is yours for ever</i>.

513
00:40:29,097 --> 00:40:31,812
<i>Complaining never</i>.

514
00:40:33,238 --> 00:40:35,920
<i>I can't have too much</i> ..

515
00:40:36,964 --> 00:40:38,227
<i>Love</i>.

516
00:40:42,933 --> 00:40:43,955
Do you know what?

517
00:40:44,751 --> 00:40:46,626
You don't look any
different in champagne.

518
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:48,242
Not any better.

519
00:40:48,916 --> 00:40:49,817
Not any worse.

520
00:40:52,071 --> 00:40:52,829
Just Kip.

521
00:40:56,449 --> 00:40:58,260
Come here. Come here and I'll show you.

522
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:00,507
I'll put some on the end of your nose.
- Hey.

523
00:41:01,835 --> 00:41:03,363
Alright. No champagne.

524
00:41:04,058 --> 00:41:05,589
I think you've had about enough too.

525
00:41:06,327 --> 00:41:08,368
Alright. No more champagne for anybody.

526
00:41:10,947 --> 00:41:11,848
You know what?

527
00:41:14,169 --> 00:41:15,499
You love your ranch too much.

528
00:41:16,892 --> 00:41:17,545
Do I?

529
00:41:18,082 --> 00:41:19,412
You love everything too much.

530
00:41:19,941 --> 00:41:20,699
Too hard.

531
00:41:21,571 --> 00:41:22,958
You love your friends too much.

532
00:41:23,975 --> 00:41:25,105
You get hurt that way.

533
00:41:26,145 --> 00:41:26,817
Maybe.

534
00:41:28,916 --> 00:41:29,733
Three Bell.

535
00:41:30,784 --> 00:41:32,000
You loved it, didn't you?

536
00:41:32,601 --> 00:41:34,903
It was a good place to be.
- You and Lee and ..

537
00:41:35,406 --> 00:41:36,236
Charlie.

538
00:41:36,753 --> 00:41:38,789
Me and Lee and Charlie.
We worked it together.

539
00:41:39,286 --> 00:41:40,970
Think you'll ever work it again?

540
00:41:41,513 --> 00:41:42,271
Together?

541
00:41:42,991 --> 00:41:44,293
There won't always be a war.

542
00:41:46,169 --> 00:41:46,841
Ranch.

543
00:41:47,824 --> 00:41:48,553
Friends.

544
00:41:51,297 --> 00:41:53,341
Is that all there was in your life, Kip?

545
00:41:56,733 --> 00:41:58,455
Let's get out of here.
It's getting late.

546
00:41:59,356 --> 00:42:00,301
No girl?

547
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,526
I got those wagons to unload tomorrow.

548
00:42:02,833 --> 00:42:03,848
How pretty is she?

549
00:42:05,277 --> 00:42:06,121
Very pretty?

550
00:42:06,795 --> 00:42:07,537
Kip.

551
00:42:09,516 --> 00:42:10,857
Kip, is she very pretty?

552
00:42:14,215 --> 00:42:16,857
Come on, Rouge.
It will be a long day tomorrow.

553
00:42:17,813 --> 00:42:18,943
It's a long day today.

554
00:42:20,711 --> 00:42:23,036
Besides, I couldn't leave
this here all alone, could I?

555
00:42:25,211 --> 00:42:27,029
Goodnight, Rouge.
- Goodnight, Kip.

556
00:43:19,699 --> 00:43:21,921
<i>Where I was born one frosty morn'</i>.

557
00:43:22,361 --> 00:43:24,978
<i>Look away, look away, look away</i>.

558
00:43:25,956 --> 00:43:27,154
<i>I wish I was in Dixie</i>.

559
00:43:27,782 --> 00:43:29,192
<i>Away, away</i>.

560
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:32,771
<i>In Dixie Land, I'll take my
stand to live and die in Dixie</i>.

561
00:43:33,334 --> 00:43:34,764
<i>Away, away</i>.

562
00:43:35,163 --> 00:43:36,721
<i>Away down south in Dixie</i>.

563
00:43:37,177 --> 00:43:38,506
<i>Away, away</i>.

564
00:43:38,979 --> 00:43:40,878
<i>Away down south in Dixie</i>.

565
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:46,014
This is the greatest thing to happen
to Texas since Sam Houston.

566
00:43:53,434 --> 00:43:54,968
Bartender. Set 'em up.

567
00:43:55,741 --> 00:43:56,674
For these two.

568
00:43:58,575 --> 00:44:01,159
Don't whistle too hard, Jake.
Your teeth will fall out.

569
00:44:01,714 --> 00:44:02,428
Rouge.

570
00:44:05,363 --> 00:44:07,536
It's a real pretty tune.
I knew you wouldn't forget it.

571
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:10,172
You know how I felt.
I was born in Missouri.

572
00:44:10,541 --> 00:44:14,194
No state is perfect. You can't blame
Missouri for everybody born there.

573
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:17,067
Kip. Charlie.

574
00:44:18,939 --> 00:44:22,124
Nice to see you boys again.
- We ain't boys anymore, Jake.

575
00:44:22,517 --> 00:44:23,825
We are full-grown now.

576
00:44:25,935 --> 00:44:26,865
What about him?

577
00:44:31,655 --> 00:44:33,310
Hey, Kip. Charlie.

578
00:44:35,818 --> 00:44:37,969
You son of a gun.
Gosh, it's good to see you.

579
00:44:38,381 --> 00:44:40,383
You boys finally caught up
with the army, huh?

580
00:44:40,723 --> 00:44:41,939
They made you an officer?

581
00:44:42,291 --> 00:44:44,209
Lieutenant Price.
The conqueror of Brownsville.

582
00:44:45,127 --> 00:44:47,516
Sure. I drew them a secret map to
the back door of Jake's saloon.

583
00:44:49,087 --> 00:44:51,122
You look mighty fine
in that uniform, Lee.

584
00:44:51,729 --> 00:44:53,919
If not for the gold braid
we've smuggled in.

585
00:44:54,226 --> 00:44:56,100
He'd be wearing brass
buttons on his underwear.

586
00:44:56,567 --> 00:44:57,251
Boys.

587
00:44:57,676 --> 00:44:59,209
You know, I'm mighty proud of y'all.

588
00:44:59,836 --> 00:45:02,330
Any time I have a roof over my
head and a dollar in my pocket.

589
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:04,417
Anything you want for, you just ask for.

590
00:45:05,367 --> 00:45:06,997
Thanks, Jake. We appreciate that.

591
00:45:07,426 --> 00:45:09,700
We'll start with your office.
We need a place to work out of.

592
00:45:10,144 --> 00:45:11,932
Charlie, you're not going
to take my office?

593
00:45:16,775 --> 00:45:18,610
Rouge. They're going to take my office.

594
00:45:19,810 --> 00:45:20,940
What am I going to do?

595
00:45:21,737 --> 00:45:24,324
Just get up there and whistle Dixie.
You're real good at it.

596
00:45:37,428 --> 00:45:38,701
Let's get down to business.

597
00:45:39,193 --> 00:45:40,664
Manuel, go down to Matamoras.

598
00:45:40,972 --> 00:45:43,735
Tell Brugnon we'll buy every shipload
of supplies he has coming in.

599
00:45:44,077 --> 00:45:44,864
Si, senor.

600
00:45:46,444 --> 00:45:48,105
This is a way around the blockade.

601
00:45:49,312 --> 00:45:51,532
Only got a 2-mile haul. No risks.

602
00:45:52,039 --> 00:45:54,653
And the confederate army protecting
you every inch of the way.

603
00:45:55,371 --> 00:45:56,186
Right, Kip?

604
00:45:56,846 --> 00:45:58,577
No, Charlie.
I've been thinking different.

605
00:45:58,876 --> 00:46:01,122
I got a feeling this may be the
turning point for the South.

606
00:46:02,235 --> 00:46:03,451
I hope you're right, Kip.

607
00:46:03,792 --> 00:46:05,008
We took Brownsville back.

608
00:46:05,722 --> 00:46:08,310
That means it will turn that way
all the way down the line now.

609
00:46:08,816 --> 00:46:10,089
Alright. What's your point?

610
00:46:10,831 --> 00:46:12,905
The fighting will be moving
farther and farther north.

611
00:46:13,382 --> 00:46:13,968
So?

612
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,601
We can go back to Three Bell.

613
00:46:16,224 --> 00:46:17,948
Go back to herding cows?

614
00:46:18,433 --> 00:46:19,191
What for?

615
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:21,003
This war isn't over yet.

616
00:46:21,396 --> 00:46:24,634
Until it is, there's a lot more
money in guns than cows.

617
00:46:25,221 --> 00:46:26,552
Guns smell nicer too.

618
00:46:27,719 --> 00:46:29,886
We weren't in this just to
pile up a lot of money.

619
00:46:30,402 --> 00:46:31,507
Who says so?

620
00:46:32,661 --> 00:46:33,991
I'm going back to Three Bell.

621
00:46:34,657 --> 00:46:35,533
I am staying.

622
00:46:37,069 --> 00:46:38,195
What about you, Lee?

623
00:46:39,342 --> 00:46:42,443
I never was part of this gun running.
I got no right to say now.

624
00:46:44,413 --> 00:46:46,316
It's a big job to handle
a ranch all alone, Kip.

625
00:46:47,002 --> 00:46:49,664
Lee is in the army.
Charlie is staying here.

626
00:46:50,329 --> 00:46:51,935
I wasn't aiming to handle it alone.

627
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:55,384
Bronco won't be much help to you.
- I wasn't thinking of Bronco either.

628
00:46:56,049 --> 00:46:57,265
I was meaning to ask Deb.

629
00:46:57,870 --> 00:47:01,141
Not the first time a man has turned to
the land with only a wife to help him.

630
00:47:03,458 --> 00:47:04,760
You know what you want, Kip.

631
00:47:06,336 --> 00:47:07,380
Is Deb in town yet?

632
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:10,993
Where have they set up the hospital?
- Over at the boarding house.

633
00:47:11,583 --> 00:47:12,607
Sadie's place.

634
00:47:19,575 --> 00:47:20,390
Well, boys.

635
00:47:20,816 --> 00:47:22,203
I guess I'll be drifting along.

636
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:27,431
I got a couple of fences
that need mending.

637
00:47:46,616 --> 00:47:47,759
Hi, professor.

638
00:47:48,698 --> 00:47:50,231
Give that piano a tinkling.

639
00:47:56,425 --> 00:47:59,561
<i>As the brass band plays
for the soldiers on parade</i>.

640
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:02,711
<i>I'm afraid the army caught my eye</i>.

641
00:48:03,351 --> 00:48:06,780
<i>And I don't know when I would
have that chance again</i>.

642
00:48:07,271 --> 00:48:09,873
<i>But then they continued marching by</i>.

643
00:48:10,817 --> 00:48:14,247
<i>I am fair of face and curved
in just the proper place</i>.

644
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:17,425
<i>There is none more loveable than I</i>.

645
00:48:18,588 --> 00:48:21,068
<i>To the men who pass</i>.

646
00:48:21,697 --> 00:48:24,471
<i>I am a most attractive lass</i>.

647
00:48:25,844 --> 00:48:28,542
<i>But alas, they continued marching by</i>.

648
00:48:29,279 --> 00:48:32,344
<i>It must be fun to have a soldier</i>.

649
00:48:32,852 --> 00:48:34,155
<i>Any soldier</i>.

650
00:48:34,667 --> 00:48:36,015
<i>To hold your hand</i>.

651
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:39,562
<i>But it takes a lot to hold your soldier</i>.

652
00:48:40,243 --> 00:48:43,042
<i>When they strike .. up the band</i>.

653
00:48:43,714 --> 00:48:45,302
<i>I detest a flirt</i>.

654
00:48:45,718 --> 00:48:48,353
<i>So I slyly raise my skirt
past my shoe tops</i>.

655
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:50,570
<i>Almost ankle high</i>.

656
00:48:51,633 --> 00:48:54,015
<i>I could feel their eyes</i>.

657
00:48:55,114 --> 00:48:58,302
<i>I could hear their murmured sighs</i>.

658
00:48:59,191 --> 00:49:02,060
<i>Otherwise they continued marching by</i>.

659
00:49:02,892 --> 00:49:06,315
<i>Otherwise they continued marching by</i>.

660
00:49:42,487 --> 00:49:43,274
Hello Deb.

661
00:49:44,047 --> 00:49:44,662
Kip.

662
00:49:45,007 --> 00:49:46,366
Lee told me I'd find you here.

663
00:49:47,267 --> 00:49:48,998
We haven't had a minute
since we got here.

664
00:49:49,483 --> 00:49:51,471
There is so much to do.
- You got a minute now?

665
00:49:52,161 --> 00:49:52,776
Two.

666
00:49:53,286 --> 00:49:54,473
I brought you something.

667
00:49:54,944 --> 00:49:56,956
As long as it isn't another cotton swab.

668
00:49:58,177 --> 00:49:59,564
It came all the way from Paris.

669
00:49:59,781 --> 00:50:02,227
Papa Brugnon says it's the latest
thing they're wearing over there.

670
00:50:06,285 --> 00:50:08,044
I know they ain't the
right thing for here.

671
00:50:08,846 --> 00:50:12,178
Maybe someday there will be a time for
wearing pretty things like that again.

672
00:50:12,886 --> 00:50:14,073
I want you to have them.

673
00:50:14,514 --> 00:50:15,532
Thank you, Kip.

674
00:50:16,081 --> 00:50:18,212
That isn't the only reason I came,
bringing them to you.

675
00:50:19,594 --> 00:50:21,347
I'm going back to Three Bell, Deb.

676
00:50:21,971 --> 00:50:23,215
Just like I said we would.

677
00:50:25,850 --> 00:50:27,266
I'm asking you to marry me, Deb.

678
00:50:28,541 --> 00:50:30,734
Kip. I can't leave here now.

679
00:50:31,498 --> 00:50:32,828
There is too much to be done.

680
00:50:33,105 --> 00:50:34,133
And too few of us.

681
00:50:34,474 --> 00:50:36,691
They need me here.
- I need you too, Deb.

682
00:50:38,596 --> 00:50:39,612
I don't know, Kip.

683
00:50:40,217 --> 00:50:41,290
What don't you know?

684
00:50:41,808 --> 00:50:44,557
Don't ask me anything.
Don't make me say anything.

685
00:50:45,666 --> 00:50:47,960
If there's anything to say
maybe now's the best time.

686
00:50:54,119 --> 00:50:55,723
Remember that day at the ranch.

687
00:50:56,885 --> 00:50:57,960
I knew it then.

688
00:50:58,503 --> 00:50:59,738
I knew then that ..

689
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:01,839
Things would never be the same again.

690
00:51:04,866 --> 00:51:06,344
Let's wait a little while.

691
00:51:06,850 --> 00:51:08,090
We've waited so long now.

692
00:51:08,623 --> 00:51:10,465
It won't hurt to wait a little longer.

693
00:51:14,262 --> 00:51:15,392
Whatever you say, Deb.

694
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:17,010
Miss Miller.

695
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:55,264
When are we pulling out, Charlie?

696
00:51:56,087 --> 00:51:56,931
Pulling out?

697
00:51:57,185 --> 00:51:59,574
We don't want to leave Cottrell down
there with Brugnon too long.

698
00:51:59,941 --> 00:52:02,625
That would be bad business. I thought
you were forgetting gun running.

699
00:52:03,032 --> 00:52:04,631
I'm remembering it again.

700
00:52:10,056 --> 00:52:13,697
There is a detachment leaving
for Santiago county on Sunday.

701
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:15,363
I am going with it.

702
00:52:23,571 --> 00:52:25,906
It is a long haul from
Matamoras to Edenton.

703
00:52:26,874 --> 00:52:27,775
It takes time.

704
00:52:28,176 --> 00:52:30,659
Lots of things can happen
in Edenton between trips.

705
00:52:32,166 --> 00:52:33,246
I trust my friends.

706
00:52:34,398 --> 00:52:35,480
I trust mine too.

707
00:52:36,615 --> 00:52:37,439
Sometimes.

708
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:43,969
Partner.

709
00:52:56,675 --> 00:52:57,493
Mister Kip.

710
00:52:58,109 --> 00:52:59,126
Mister Kip.

711
00:53:01,850 --> 00:53:02,956
Where is Mister Kip?

712
00:53:03,402 --> 00:53:04,990
He's in the office. What's up, Manuel?

713
00:53:05,302 --> 00:53:06,489
Mister Kip. Mister Kip.

714
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:08,607
Mister Kip. Mister Kip.

715
00:53:10,577 --> 00:53:11,785
Mister Kip. Mister Kip.

716
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:13,905
[ Spanish language ]

717
00:53:23,351 --> 00:53:24,853
Cottrell? Cottrell, what about him?

718
00:53:25,070 --> 00:53:26,750
Cottrell. He tried to kill me.

719
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:28,170
He said no more loads.

720
00:53:28,466 --> 00:53:30,841
If we go to Matamoras he's
going to kill all of us.

721
00:53:32,952 --> 00:53:34,001
Did you hear that?

722
00:53:34,218 --> 00:53:36,318
Cottrell is sitting as top
man in Matamoras now.

723
00:53:36,824 --> 00:53:39,737
He can stop any ship of supplies that
comes in. He's put us out of business.

724
00:53:40,244 --> 00:53:40,973
Alright.

725
00:53:41,421 --> 00:53:42,551
We're out of business.

726
00:53:45,085 --> 00:53:47,494
I don't like to be put out of business.
- Not so fast.

727
00:53:48,313 --> 00:53:49,677
A big shipment just came in.

728
00:53:50,715 --> 00:53:53,026
It will be freighted from the
sea to Matamoras tomorrow.

729
00:53:53,475 --> 00:53:55,142
It don't have to reach Cottrell.

730
00:53:56,449 --> 00:53:58,164
No. It don't.
- It will mean a fight.

731
00:53:59,474 --> 00:54:00,518
Not if we're smart.

732
00:54:05,382 --> 00:54:07,423
Don't forget.
We're meant to be Yankee cavalry.

733
00:54:07,986 --> 00:54:09,094
Try to act like them.

734
00:54:11,804 --> 00:54:13,217
Bronco, button up that collar.

735
00:54:13,511 --> 00:54:16,394
Ain't it bad enough wearing a Yankee
coat without having it choke you?

736
00:54:16,804 --> 00:54:18,993
I don't like it, Kip.
Ain't there another way of doing it?

737
00:54:19,357 --> 00:54:22,040
Yeah. You can go on back to Brownsville.
We don't need you anyhow.

738
00:54:22,343 --> 00:54:23,502
Let him alone, Charlie.

739
00:54:23,719 --> 00:54:25,164
We never should have brought him.

740
00:54:34,903 --> 00:54:35,833
Here they come.

741
00:54:43,429 --> 00:54:45,160
This is going to be
like flushing rabbits.

742
00:55:03,655 --> 00:55:04,909
Get down off that box.

743
00:55:08,322 --> 00:55:10,070
But, Senor. This is Mexico.

744
00:55:10,382 --> 00:55:11,709
You have no right.

745
00:55:12,129 --> 00:55:13,475
Come on, pronto. Move.

746
00:55:15,295 --> 00:55:16,164
Manuel.

747
00:55:16,641 --> 00:55:18,155
Mount up on this wagon.

748
00:55:19,425 --> 00:55:20,841
Alright, boys. Let's get moving.

749
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:21,772
Yanks.

750
00:56:22,202 --> 00:56:23,303
Dismount. Take cover.

751
00:57:06,834 --> 00:57:08,450
Hold it, Charlie. They're confederates.

752
00:57:08,718 --> 00:57:10,584
Their bullets can kill you just as dead.

753
00:57:11,984 --> 00:57:13,620
Stop shooting. We ain't Yanks.

754
00:57:14,051 --> 00:57:15,224
Stop shooting.

755
00:57:20,971 --> 00:57:22,661
Hold your fire. We ain't Yankees.

756
00:57:24,447 --> 00:57:25,322
I knew it.

757
00:57:26,773 --> 00:57:28,908
We ain't Yanks. We ain't Yanks.

758
00:57:29,816 --> 00:57:31,998
You see, Charlie? You got us into this.

759
00:57:32,324 --> 00:57:34,347
If it hadn't been for you we ..
- Shut up.

760
00:58:08,362 --> 00:58:09,721
Looks like we've stopped them.

761
00:58:52,053 --> 00:58:53,326
You had no call to do that.

762
00:58:53,944 --> 00:58:54,931
It was him or me.

763
00:58:55,852 --> 00:58:58,355
Better get out of these Yankee suits.
We're in confederate territory.

764
00:59:43,366 --> 00:59:44,982
Alright. Let's get the wagons unloaded.

765
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:48,863
I didn't know you were
bringing a load tonight.

766
00:59:49,088 --> 00:59:49,745
Yeah.

767
00:59:50,234 --> 00:59:53,133
Did you see anything of Captain
Jeffrey's patrol? He's way overdue.

768
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:54,787
No. We haven't seen him.

769
01:00:05,447 --> 01:00:07,105
Looks like you got shot up a little.

770
01:00:07,733 --> 01:00:09,092
Did you run into some trouble?

771
01:00:09,776 --> 01:00:11,206
No. There wasn't any trouble.

772
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:32,814
Hi, Lee.

773
01:00:33,491 --> 01:00:35,222
Where did you get the
fancy pants, Bronco?

774
01:00:35,983 --> 01:00:38,441
I told them there would be trouble.

775
01:00:38,788 --> 01:00:39,796
I told them, Lee.

776
01:00:40,522 --> 01:00:42,828
Yankee pants always bring trouble.

777
01:00:43,316 --> 01:00:45,288
I told them I didn't
want to put them on.

778
01:00:45,624 --> 01:00:47,040
Don't go jumping to things, Lee.

779
01:00:47,595 --> 01:00:49,692
He don't know what he's
talking about. He is drunk.

780
01:00:50,952 --> 01:00:52,333
You ain't mad, Lee?

781
01:00:53,341 --> 01:00:54,921
You ain't really mad, are you?

782
01:01:01,101 --> 01:01:01,859
Charlie.

783
01:01:02,478 --> 01:01:03,615
Lee is mad at me.

784
01:01:04,733 --> 01:01:07,978
You go and tell him I didn't
want to put these pants on.

785
01:01:08,476 --> 01:01:09,463
You know, Bronco.

786
01:01:10,219 --> 01:01:12,232
They should have killed
you down at the port.

787
01:01:21,146 --> 01:01:22,877
I told you not to let
Bronco ride with us.

788
01:01:23,608 --> 01:01:25,789
Look. I had an old dog once.
I loved him too.

789
01:01:26,205 --> 01:01:28,369
But when he went lame
and blind I shot him.

790
01:01:29,112 --> 01:01:30,996
Where's Bronco now?
- Never mind, Bronco.

791
01:01:31,613 --> 01:01:34,418
When news of that patrol gets through,
Lee will know what happened.

792
01:01:34,787 --> 01:01:35,745
What about that?

793
01:01:37,061 --> 01:01:38,415
Yeah. What about it?

794
01:01:40,052 --> 01:01:41,509
The news has come through.

795
01:01:42,657 --> 01:01:44,245
You wiped out that patrol, didn't you?

796
01:01:44,604 --> 01:01:46,975
Killed Jeffrey. Murdered men
wearing the same uniform I am.

797
01:01:47,349 --> 01:01:49,859
We couldn't help it. They started
shooting and we defended ourselves.

798
01:01:50,301 --> 01:01:51,574
Defend the wagons you mean.

799
01:01:51,873 --> 01:01:54,033
You were willing to fight us
or kill our men or anything.

800
01:01:54,250 --> 01:01:55,679
To be sure you get your money.

801
01:01:56,199 --> 01:01:58,528
That ain't exactly the way it was.
- Just a minute, Lee.

802
01:01:59,058 --> 01:02:00,445
We ain't running guns for love.

803
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:03,989
We don't sit and swallow your lead
because of the pretty uniform you wear.

804
01:02:04,494 --> 01:02:05,519
Cut it, Charlie.

805
01:02:05,979 --> 01:02:07,406
At least Charlie makes sense.

806
01:02:08,327 --> 01:02:09,828
Only I ain't having any part of it.

807
01:02:10,451 --> 01:02:11,893
With you anymore or the ranch.

808
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:13,530
I'm walking out.

809
01:02:14,570 --> 01:02:15,974
It ain't that easy, Lee.

810
01:02:17,588 --> 01:02:19,719
How do we know you're going
to keep your mouth shut?

811
01:03:48,157 --> 01:03:48,858
Bronco.

812
01:03:56,969 --> 01:03:58,506
Why did you take him with you, Kip?

813
01:03:59,245 --> 01:04:01,255
Why did you let him
ride with you at all?

814
01:04:03,067 --> 01:04:04,661
Bronco. Bronco.

815
01:04:11,004 --> 01:04:13,223
Get the boys together.
We're going after Cottrell.

816
01:04:15,286 --> 01:04:17,921
What's the good of killing Cottrell now?
Or getting yourself killed?

817
01:04:18,138 --> 01:04:19,124
I won't kill him.

818
01:04:19,423 --> 01:04:21,697
I'll bring him back here so he
can see the ranches he burned.

819
01:04:21,932 --> 01:04:24,481
And the graves of Bronco and the others
he murdered who had no chance.

820
01:04:25,095 --> 01:04:26,254
Then let them hang him.

821
01:04:26,664 --> 01:04:27,873
I ain't going with you.

822
01:04:28,344 --> 01:04:29,929
Bronco ain't worth dying for.

823
01:04:37,846 --> 01:04:40,784
You're smart enough to go, Charlie.
You have too much to lose.

824
01:04:41,261 --> 01:04:43,439
Half of the biggest gun-running
business in Texas.

825
01:04:43,959 --> 01:04:47,883
If Kip happens to get a bellyful of lead
down there you'll have the whole thing.

826
01:04:48,812 --> 01:04:51,923
A few men riding into Matamoras
make mighty easy targets.

827
01:04:52,410 --> 01:04:55,192
Especially if Cottrell happens
to be waiting for them.

828
01:04:55,699 --> 01:04:56,699
Listen, you.

829
01:04:57,247 --> 01:04:58,535
Take your hands off me.

830
01:05:02,558 --> 01:05:04,097
You could be top man, Charlie.

831
01:05:04,628 --> 01:05:06,262
Run things just the way you want it.

832
01:05:08,573 --> 01:05:10,612
It will take Kip a while
to round up some men.

833
01:05:11,721 --> 01:05:13,824
You won't be needing me for
anything, will you Charlie?

834
01:05:14,328 --> 01:05:15,372
I'm kinda restless.

835
01:05:16,230 --> 01:05:17,871
A good fast ride is just what I need.

836
01:06:06,745 --> 01:06:07,646
You stay here.

837
01:06:41,287 --> 01:06:42,303
Something's wrong.

838
01:07:39,251 --> 01:07:39,952
Manuel!

839
01:08:13,801 --> 01:08:14,473
Davis.

840
01:08:26,764 --> 01:08:27,436
Davis.

841
01:08:56,559 --> 01:08:57,317
Cottrell.

842
01:09:00,288 --> 01:09:01,160
Don't, Davis.

843
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:02,192
Don't.

844
01:09:02,984 --> 01:09:03,656
Don't.

845
01:09:04,224 --> 01:09:05,783
You're coming back with me, Cottrell.

846
01:09:06,304 --> 01:09:09,036
You'll get on your knees over Bronco's
grave and then I'll let them hang you.

847
01:09:09,336 --> 01:09:10,752
Wait. I'll make a deal with you.

848
01:09:11,093 --> 01:09:13,834
There's things you don't know.
That you won't find out until too late.

849
01:09:14,397 --> 01:09:15,870
Others knew you were coming here.

850
01:09:29,248 --> 01:09:30,763
I thought you needed a little help.

851
01:09:34,223 --> 01:09:36,371
You said you were good with that knife.
- Yeah.

852
01:09:36,757 --> 01:09:39,350
I didn't think Charlie was right
letting you come here alone.

853
01:09:39,982 --> 01:09:40,883
You are lying.

854
01:10:26,025 --> 01:10:26,955
You're leaving?

855
01:10:27,172 --> 01:10:28,101
Yes, Kip. I am.

856
01:10:28,415 --> 01:10:29,431
Because of Bronco?

857
01:10:30,346 --> 01:10:31,983
Seeing Bronco dead there in the dirt.

858
01:10:32,476 --> 01:10:33,606
I can't stay here now.

859
01:10:33,823 --> 01:10:34,666
Not anymore.

860
01:10:35,411 --> 01:10:36,636
You're not coming back?

861
01:10:37,949 --> 01:10:38,678
No, Kip.

862
01:10:39,169 --> 01:10:40,898
Is Bronco the only
reason you're leaving?

863
01:11:01,737 --> 01:11:02,724
You've got a gun.

864
01:11:03,052 --> 01:11:04,149
Why don't you draw?

865
01:11:04,814 --> 01:11:06,373
Yeah. We can draw on each other, Kip.

866
01:11:06,695 --> 01:11:08,197
Maybe it would be a tie. Then what?

867
01:11:08,641 --> 01:11:10,764
What good would that do
for you or for me or for Deb?

868
01:11:12,548 --> 01:11:13,506
Don't blame Lee.

869
01:11:13,956 --> 01:11:16,316
It wasn't anything he did.
It was something that happened to me.

870
01:11:17,091 --> 01:11:19,302
Being near him.
Watching him ride out to fight.

871
01:11:19,835 --> 01:11:21,308
Not knowing if he was coming back.

872
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:22,830
Praying that he would.

873
01:11:23,585 --> 01:11:25,802
Suddenly and not really facing it,
I knew that I loved him.

874
01:11:27,094 --> 01:11:28,691
I tried to fight it, Kip. I did.

875
01:11:30,711 --> 01:11:31,526
Three Bell.

876
01:11:32,553 --> 01:11:34,084
We were always going to be together.

877
01:11:35,450 --> 01:11:36,637
You took Deb away and ..

878
01:11:37,828 --> 01:11:39,044
Charlie tried to kill me.

879
01:11:57,733 --> 01:11:58,834
Are you alright, Kip?

880
01:11:59,122 --> 01:11:59,911
I'm fine.

881
01:12:07,528 --> 01:12:08,715
You got back fast, Slim.

882
01:12:09,271 --> 01:12:10,981
Yeah. I got a good horse.

883
01:12:11,506 --> 01:12:13,974
Slim told me how it went, Kip.
I'm real glad. I was worried.

884
01:12:15,288 --> 01:12:16,610
I know you were, Charlie.

885
01:12:21,065 --> 01:12:22,281
What are you looking for?

886
01:12:23,373 --> 01:12:24,883
How much we got stacked there?

887
01:12:26,063 --> 01:12:27,171
I don't know exactly.

888
01:12:27,709 --> 01:12:28,324
Why?

889
01:12:28,818 --> 01:12:31,107
It don't matter. It's all yours now.

890
01:12:31,635 --> 01:12:34,127
My share and Lee's.
Take it. I'm giving it to you.

891
01:12:34,717 --> 01:12:35,818
It's what you wanted.

892
01:12:36,219 --> 01:12:38,150
The whole gun-running
business right in your lap.

893
01:12:38,894 --> 01:12:40,453
You ought to make a lot of money now.

894
01:12:40,958 --> 01:12:42,574
A lot of friends. Like Slim here.

895
01:12:43,682 --> 01:12:45,728
He's willing to do almost
anything for you, ain't he?

896
01:12:55,146 --> 01:12:57,645
If I was Kip I'd cut your
throat with your own knife.

897
01:13:00,828 --> 01:13:03,620
As you've made a clean
sweep today I'll pull out too.

898
01:13:04,474 --> 01:13:05,775
You can have my share.

899
01:13:06,568 --> 01:13:07,870
You don't have to go, Rouge.

900
01:13:09,726 --> 01:13:11,621
You and I could be a lot
of help to each other.

901
01:13:13,171 --> 01:13:15,192
You can be a lot of help
to me right now, Charlie.

902
01:13:15,924 --> 01:13:16,568
Yeah.

903
01:13:17,910 --> 01:13:19,996
Where does a cowboy go
when he's on the move?

904
01:13:20,809 --> 01:13:21,767
Don't be a fool.

905
01:13:22,212 --> 01:13:24,143
He ain't got nothing but
the clothes on his back.

906
01:13:25,321 --> 01:13:26,708
It's how you wear 'em, Charlie.

907
01:13:28,141 --> 01:13:29,486
It's all in how you wear 'em.

908
01:13:34,927 --> 01:13:37,675
We're making a mistake.
He's likely to come back someday.

909
01:13:38,069 --> 01:13:40,155
We'll have to do then what
we ought to be doing now.

910
01:13:40,724 --> 01:13:42,877
Let him go. He can't bother us.
Nobody can.

911
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:05,629
'Proclamation'.

912
01:14:06,308 --> 01:14:11,250
'Hostilities have ceased and a state of
emergency exists in the State of Texas'.

913
01:14:12,231 --> 01:14:16,894
'Authority to maintain law and order is
hereby delegated to the Texas Rangers'.

914
01:14:18,033 --> 01:14:20,071
'By order of the Governor
of the State of Texas'.

915
01:14:24,555 --> 01:14:26,102
Now, Slim. That wasn't nice.

916
01:14:26,802 --> 01:14:29,049
They went to a lot of trouble
to get all them signs printed.

917
01:14:29,476 --> 01:14:30,406
It ain't funny.

918
01:14:30,697 --> 01:14:33,206
We don't want no Texas Ranger
sticking his nose into our business.

919
01:14:59,537 --> 01:15:00,374
Lee.

920
01:15:11,237 --> 01:15:12,959
Hello Lee.
- Hello Charlie.

921
01:15:14,419 --> 01:15:15,206
Hello Deb.

922
01:15:16,394 --> 01:15:17,381
Been a long time.

923
01:15:18,028 --> 01:15:21,345
I heard they'd made you a ranger but
didn't figure you'd come to Brownsville.

924
01:15:22,087 --> 01:15:24,114
I go where I'm sent.
- Are you all they sent?

925
01:15:24,553 --> 01:15:25,428
One ranger?

926
01:15:26,262 --> 01:15:27,781
There's only one town, ain't there?

927
01:15:28,459 --> 01:15:32,056
You aiming to find out which of us is
quicker on the draw after all this time?

928
01:15:32,605 --> 01:15:33,277
Maybe.

929
01:15:34,070 --> 01:15:36,404
If it hadn't been for Kip we'd
have found out a long time ago.

930
01:15:36,821 --> 01:15:38,281
I'm thinking Kip made a mistake.

931
01:15:39,058 --> 01:15:41,384
But he ain't making any more.
He's living over in Matamoras.

932
01:15:42,116 --> 01:15:43,190
Nice and peaceful.

933
01:15:43,781 --> 01:15:44,911
Not bothering anybody.

934
01:15:45,777 --> 01:15:47,508
Why don't you take a
lesson from him, Lee?

935
01:15:48,358 --> 01:15:51,935
Or do you figure I won't do anything as
you still wear a bell on your spurs?

936
01:15:53,532 --> 01:15:54,948
You're wearing one too, Charlie.

937
01:15:55,291 --> 01:15:57,020
Don't figure it counts for anything.

938
01:15:57,478 --> 01:15:58,262
I don't.

939
01:15:59,206 --> 01:16:00,243
Then go back, Lee.

940
01:16:01,033 --> 01:16:02,192
Get out of Brownsville.

941
01:16:02,755 --> 01:16:04,085
I came down here to do a job.

942
01:16:04,545 --> 01:16:05,811
And I'm staying to do it.

943
01:16:06,292 --> 01:16:10,180
I got what I want now, Lee. Nobody will
take it away from me. Not even you.

944
01:16:11,536 --> 01:16:12,826
Get him out of here, Deb.

945
01:16:13,201 --> 01:16:14,560
If you want to keep him alive.

946
01:16:16,426 --> 01:16:19,660
I got a fair old game at 4 o'clock and
I ain't stopping it for a shooting.

947
01:16:20,585 --> 01:16:21,931
Be out of here before then.

948
01:16:22,931 --> 01:16:24,891
I'll be down to take a look
at your game, Charlie.

949
01:16:26,307 --> 01:16:27,294
Don't do it, Lee.

950
01:16:28,402 --> 01:16:29,561
Don't make me kill you.

951
01:16:45,035 --> 01:16:47,126
Go over to the hotel, Deb.
Wait for me there.

952
01:17:18,418 --> 01:17:19,699
<i>Much time</i>.

953
01:17:20,838 --> 01:17:22,964
<i>Is wasted in waiting</i>.

954
01:17:24,975 --> 01:17:26,277
<i>For the one</i>.

955
01:17:27,906 --> 01:17:29,960
<i>Who called you his own</i>.

956
01:17:32,533 --> 01:17:37,150
<i>That's why my heart is yours forever</i>.

957
01:17:38,396 --> 01:17:40,104
<i>Complaining never</i>.

958
01:17:41,610 --> 01:17:44,462
<i>I can't have too much love</i>.

959
01:17:47,292 --> 01:17:49,539
Don't bother, Pedro.
It sounds better flat.

960
01:17:54,334 --> 01:17:57,527
Jose Alvorado said he'd be needing
a top hand around branding time.

961
01:17:59,224 --> 01:18:00,583
Why not ride down and see him?

962
01:18:01,162 --> 01:18:03,881
Let Alvorado handle his own cows.
I don't like his brand.

963
01:18:04,844 --> 01:18:05,573
Dominic.

964
01:18:08,627 --> 01:18:09,540
Tequila.

965
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:13,506
What about this one? It is not paid for.

966
01:18:14,248 --> 01:18:15,229
Give me that.

967
01:18:15,911 --> 01:18:16,757
Vamoose.

968
01:18:20,667 --> 01:18:21,282
You?

969
01:18:22,630 --> 01:18:23,274
Sure.

970
01:18:37,746 --> 01:18:39,603
Hello Kip.
- Hello Deb.

971
01:18:41,647 --> 01:18:43,844
I'm so glad to find you.
I've looked everywhere.

972
01:18:45,088 --> 01:18:47,810
Just ask anyone in Matamoras.
They all know Kip Davis.

973
01:18:48,949 --> 01:18:50,435
You never met Deb, did you Rouge?

974
01:18:50,871 --> 01:18:52,085
No. We never really met.

975
01:18:52,589 --> 01:18:54,544
Kip used to tell me
about you in Matamoras.

976
01:18:55,012 --> 01:18:55,884
Papa Brugnon.

977
01:18:56,278 --> 01:18:57,551
He's told me about you too.

978
01:18:57,938 --> 01:18:59,268
What are you doing down here?

979
01:18:59,487 --> 01:19:02,497
Last I heard was about San Antonio
with you and Lee getting married.

980
01:19:02,843 --> 01:19:04,358
Something like that.
- Yes.

981
01:19:06,215 --> 01:19:07,349
He's here with you?

982
01:19:07,832 --> 01:19:09,363
The rangers sent him to Brownsville.

983
01:19:09,842 --> 01:19:10,571
Rangers?

984
01:19:11,519 --> 01:19:12,678
Lee ought to like that.

985
01:19:13,365 --> 01:19:14,495
You know how he feels.

986
01:19:15,195 --> 01:19:15,839
Yeah.

987
01:19:16,793 --> 01:19:18,037
Yeah. I know how he feels.

988
01:19:18,466 --> 01:19:19,637
He needs help, Kip.

989
01:19:20,183 --> 01:19:22,000
He sent you down here?
- No. He doesn't know.

990
01:19:22,481 --> 01:19:23,754
But you've got to help him.

991
01:19:24,375 --> 01:19:25,088
Why me?

992
01:19:25,983 --> 01:19:27,469
They ran out of rangers in Texas?

993
01:19:28,012 --> 01:19:29,571
Come to Brownsville. Talk to Charlie.

994
01:19:31,317 --> 01:19:34,144
Me and Charlie ain't been
exactly on speaking terms lately.

995
01:19:34,561 --> 01:19:35,632
He'll kill Lee.

996
01:19:36,201 --> 01:19:37,588
I wouldn't be too sure of that.

997
01:19:37,975 --> 01:19:39,334
Lee's pretty handy with a gun.

998
01:19:39,562 --> 01:19:42,328
One man against Charlie
and Slim and all the others?

999
01:19:42,705 --> 01:19:44,693
What do you expect me to do?
- He'll listen to you.

1000
01:19:46,350 --> 01:19:47,660
You've got to stop him.

1001
01:19:48,555 --> 01:19:50,324
No-one asked Lee to join the rangers.

1002
01:19:50,894 --> 01:19:52,227
All he has to do is resign.

1003
01:19:53,733 --> 01:19:54,753
You know he won't.

1004
01:19:56,329 --> 01:19:57,596
That ain't my business.

1005
01:20:01,363 --> 01:20:02,312
Alright, Kip.

1006
01:20:03,460 --> 01:20:04,866
No-one can make you come.

1007
01:20:06,340 --> 01:20:07,327
I only thought ..

1008
01:20:27,027 --> 01:20:27,756
Stop it.

1009
01:20:30,351 --> 01:20:31,853
You're a real big hero, aren't you?

1010
01:20:32,732 --> 01:20:35,178
You've got him under your thumb.
You're going to get even with him.

1011
01:20:35,925 --> 01:20:38,368
What are you going to do, spend
the rest of your life getting even?

1012
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:41,176
That's about the shape of it, isn't it?

1013
01:20:42,929 --> 01:20:45,089
And I'm the girl who's supposed
to sit here and watch it.

1014
01:20:46,683 --> 01:20:48,963
What have you got against Lee?
That he was in love with Deb?

1015
01:20:50,173 --> 01:20:52,018
What do you want him
to do, eat his heart out?

1016
01:20:52,383 --> 01:20:54,732
To forget he ever knew her
or saw her or wanted her?

1017
01:20:55,087 --> 01:20:56,217
Cut it, Rouge. Cut it.

1018
01:20:56,451 --> 01:20:58,215
You're not even in
love with Deb anymore.

1019
01:20:58,644 --> 01:21:00,575
At least that was an honest excuse.

1020
01:21:02,322 --> 01:21:05,617
But it's not honest to sit here with a
bottle eating your heart out with hate.

1021
01:21:06,268 --> 01:21:08,342
Forget Lee. Forget Deb. Forget them all.

1022
01:21:10,244 --> 01:21:12,146
There. Do your own forgetting.

1023
01:21:13,538 --> 01:21:14,668
But count me out, Kip.

1024
01:21:15,748 --> 01:21:18,034
Lee was your friend and he
couldn't help what he did.

1025
01:21:19,409 --> 01:21:21,367
But you can sure help what you're doing.

1026
01:21:41,065 --> 01:21:41,777
Kip.

1027
01:21:43,780 --> 01:21:45,822
I didn't mean it, Kip. I didn't mean it.

1028
01:21:49,098 --> 01:21:50,228
You were right, Rouge.

1029
01:21:50,644 --> 01:21:51,868
About almost everything.

1030
01:21:52,474 --> 01:21:53,833
I'm going back to Brownsville.

1031
01:21:54,979 --> 01:21:57,148
I can't keep hating Lee or even Charlie.

1032
01:21:57,757 --> 01:21:58,887
Maybe we had to split.

1033
01:21:59,250 --> 01:22:02,670
I can't see it ending in a killing over
the last of what's left of Three Bell.

1034
01:22:04,467 --> 01:22:05,085
Kip.

1035
01:22:06,739 --> 01:22:08,361
You were wrong about one thing though.

1036
01:22:09,398 --> 01:22:11,092
It wasn't only hate that kept me going.

1037
01:22:16,859 --> 01:22:18,304
Did they always call you Rouge?

1038
01:22:18,770 --> 01:22:20,529
Even when you were
a kid back in Louisiana?

1039
01:22:21,256 --> 01:22:21,916
No.

1040
01:22:23,514 --> 01:22:24,701
What was your real name?

1041
01:22:26,102 --> 01:22:27,048
Charlotte.

1042
01:22:28,114 --> 01:22:28,901
Charlotte.

1043
01:22:30,238 --> 01:22:31,639
That's a real pretty name.

1044
01:22:34,445 --> 01:22:36,147
You'd better go back
and sing now, honey.

1045
01:22:37,394 --> 01:22:39,337
Save an encore for me when I get back.

1046
01:22:57,318 --> 01:22:59,043
Don't let me waste that encore, cowboy.

1047
01:23:01,844 --> 01:23:03,174
I want you around to hear it.

1048
01:23:05,271 --> 01:23:05,977
Sure.

1049
01:24:05,855 --> 01:24:06,642
Hello Lee.

1050
01:24:08,712 --> 01:24:09,499
Hello Kip.

1051
01:24:16,121 --> 01:24:17,680
You figuring on taking a little walk?

1052
01:24:18,043 --> 01:24:20,052
The weather seems to
be clouding up some.

1053
01:24:20,590 --> 01:24:21,606
I was figuring to.

1054
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:24,044
Mind if I go along?

1055
01:24:26,815 --> 01:24:28,231
If you don't mind a little rain.

1056
01:24:36,947 --> 01:24:37,868
That's Kip.

1057
01:24:38,698 --> 01:24:40,601
Where did he come from?
He has no business here.

1058
01:24:40,844 --> 01:24:43,214
It looks like he thinks he has.
That makes it our business.

1059
01:24:44,986 --> 01:24:46,827
The boys are ready any
time you are, Charlie.

1060
01:24:49,496 --> 01:24:51,427
The gun in that window
is waiting for the signal.

1061
01:25:21,892 --> 01:25:23,326
[ Spurs tinkling ]

1062
01:25:46,117 --> 01:25:47,333
What are you waiting for?

1063
01:25:48,500 --> 01:25:49,773
What's the matter with you?

1064
01:25:49,990 --> 01:25:52,150
Give him the signal or I will.
- I still run this outfit.

1065
01:25:52,401 --> 01:25:54,416
Then what's stopping you?
The tinkle of those spurs?

1066
01:25:54,948 --> 01:25:56,851
Three Bell was burnt a long time ago.
Forget it.

1067
01:26:00,919 --> 01:26:03,480
You can sit this one out, Charlie.
I'll take good care of your friends.

1068
01:26:44,650 --> 01:26:46,689
You won't go changing
the brand, will you Kip?

1069
01:26:48,214 --> 01:26:49,058
No, Charlie.

1070
01:26:50,061 --> 01:26:51,443
It will always be Three Bell.

1071
01:27:15,399 --> 01:27:17,496
Well, Mrs Davis.
We got a big job ahead of us.

1072
01:27:18,242 --> 01:27:20,173
I'll have to get a couple
of boys to help us out.

1073
01:27:20,865 --> 01:27:22,375
It takes three to run this place.

1074
01:27:23,686 --> 01:27:26,104
Give me a few years and I'll
see what I can do for you.

1075
01:27:29,816 --> 01:27:30,763
Giddy up.

1076
01:27:43,718 --> 01:27:44,490
..r-s..
