1
00:00:00,156 --> 00:00:02,823
(door creaking)

2
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,907
(beer spurting)

3
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:34,363
<v ->Oh man.</v>

4
00:00:38,688 --> 00:00:39,521
Perfect.

5
00:00:39,521 --> 00:00:42,438
(voices clamoring)

6
00:00:46,245 --> 00:00:49,412
(audience applauding)

7
00:00:52,362 --> 00:00:55,780
I am super happy and super proud.

8
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:58,160
I never thought that this is gonna be like that,

9
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,370
like people really happy about crazy stuff.

10
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:04,020
Which is actually not crazy, that's how beer started.

11
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:07,413
Taste that.

12
00:01:07,413 --> 00:01:10,530
I know independency really matters,

13
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,230
because then I can support the microbreweries,

14
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:16,010
go on the road, meet the brewers, taste the beer,

15
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,981
put it in your car,

16
00:01:17,981 --> 00:01:20,030
hop to the other bar, clean your taps,

17
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:22,623
plug the beer, send it fresh and clean.

18
00:01:22,623 --> 00:01:25,540
(voices clamoring)

19
00:01:27,859 --> 00:01:32,859
(bright music)
(insects chirping)

20
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,960
<v ->Beer is my art.</v>

21
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,666
It is a way to express myself,

22
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:57,560
an architect to capture whatever it is

23
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,150
that it has inspired you.

24
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:02,120
And how can you serve that in a liquid form?

25
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:07,120
And so it's, it's an art, like any other art in my eyes.

26
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,530
I just don't know how to paint, so I know how to brew.

27
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:11,580
So I started brewing.

28
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:13,803
Simple.

29
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,616
There's another deer coming here.

30
00:02:16,616 --> 00:02:19,283
(upbeat music)

31
00:03:13,609 --> 00:03:15,557
(valve spinning)

32
00:03:15,557 --> 00:03:19,557
(speaking in foreign language)

33
00:04:41,601 --> 00:04:44,101
(light music)

34
00:05:19,758 --> 00:05:22,841
(machinery whirring)

35
00:05:42,773 --> 00:05:47,773
(voices clamoring)
(glass clinking)

36
00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:53,722
(bright music)

37
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:22,899
(beer pouring)
(light music)

38
00:06:29,258 --> 00:06:32,512
(glasses clinking)

39
00:06:32,512 --> 00:06:35,345
(energetic music)

40
00:08:12,995 --> 00:08:17,995
(birds chirping)
(soft music)

41
00:09:26,354 --> 00:09:29,021
(both laughing)

42
00:12:49,659 --> 00:12:54,659
(light music)
(grass rustling)

43
00:15:52,046 --> 00:15:57,046
(upbeat music)
(birds chirping)

44
00:18:47,949 --> 00:18:50,782
(energetic music)

45
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:56,483
(siren wailing)

46
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:05,890
<v ->Every craft brewer I know had some connection</v>

47
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:08,893
with home brewing.
(horn honking)

48
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:16,200
I was a journalist before I started Brooklyn Brewery,

49
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,330
and I was sent to Iran to cover the hostage story,

50
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:20,810
the wars in Lebanon.

51
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:24,230
I moved to Cairo and I was sitting behind President Sadat

52
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,630
when he was assassinated there.

53
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:28,550
But the biggest impact on my life

54
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:30,590
was meeting American diplomats

55
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,630
who had worked in Saudi Arabia,

56
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:35,550
where they have Islamic law, no alcohol,

57
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,067
and they were avid homebrewers.

58
00:19:37,067 --> 00:19:40,140
And the idea of making beer in your kitchen

59
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,833
just seemed like, wow, I could do that.

60
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,160
My neighbor, his name is Tom Potter,

61
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,100
he thought my idea was ridiculous

62
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,670
because he knew that the big breweries were getting bigger

63
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:54,050
and the regional breweries in the U.S.

64
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:56,060
were going out of business.

65
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:59,520
But eventually I showed him that there were small breweries

66
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,720
that were successful.

67
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,830
Tom went to the Craft Brewers Conference

68
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:07,760
in Portland, Oregon in 1986.

69
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,290
At that time,

70
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:14,290
there were fewer than like 50 breweries in all of America.

71
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,650
And all of these new breweries were at this conference.

72
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,360
And there's my partner, Tom,

73
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,920
he's got a Brooks Brothers suit.

74
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,470
He's from New York City.

75
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:25,780
They all wanted to talk to him

76
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:30,130
thinking he could be a potential source of money, financing.

77
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:32,100
And they gave him their business plans.

78
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,710
He came back to New York realizing

79
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:37,020
that this could be a real business,

80
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:41,949
that it wasn't just his crazy upstairs neighbor's idea.

81
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,532
(upbeat music)

82
00:20:45,592 --> 00:20:48,260
<v ->I was a brewer in Roeselare, Belgium.</v>

83
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:53,163
In '96, I was invited to do some talk about sour beer

84
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:57,320
or Belgian beers in the Craft Brewers Conference,,

85
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,570
it was at that year in Boston.

86
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:00,370
That's where I met Kim and Jeff,

87
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:02,170
who had started New Belgium.

88
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:04,320
And they were looking for a Belgian brewer.

89
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,178
Alright, well, good luck.

90
00:21:07,178 --> 00:21:09,845
(upbeat music)

91
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:20,450
We were staying at the brewmaster from Cambridge Brewing,

92
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:23,160
and he said, do you know where Colorado is?

93
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,123
And I go no.

94
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,340
That broody New Belgium,

95
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,940
it's kind of an up and coming brewery.

96
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:31,003
Yeah right, Darrell, what are you saying?

97
00:21:31,003 --> 00:21:33,487
He's like aren't you on vacation right now?

98
00:21:33,487 --> 00:21:34,383
I'm like, yeah.

99
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:38,210
He's like why would you not go to Colorado

100
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:40,990
and checked that brewery New Belgium out.

101
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:41,823
As we continued to drive,

102
00:21:41,823 --> 00:21:44,490
we thought maybe we should check in with Kim.

103
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:47,180
So I called her on the coast in Maine.

104
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,610
It was a huge waves and I could barely,

105
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:51,970
I'm like, hey Kim, were you serious

106
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:53,400
that you were looking for the Belgian brewer?

107
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,170
She said yeah, I was serious.

108
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:58,580
So we're like, okay, we'll drive over there.

109
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:01,150
We drove all the way here through cornfields

110
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:03,943
to boring landscape.

111
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,130
Suddenly there were mountains.

112
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:09,316
Snowcapped mountains.

113
00:22:09,316 --> 00:22:10,918
Wow.

114
00:22:10,918 --> 00:22:12,764
There's mountains here.

115
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:13,730
And there's something we could do.

116
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:15,620
And then we came in in the brewery

117
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,823
and they just had moved in this location.

118
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,330
This, where we're standing right now,

119
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:21,540
was the packaging hall.

120
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,940
So it was really a very small brewery.

121
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,520
And there were a lot of issues.

122
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,160
So there were so many issues here that I was like, wow.

123
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:32,800
If I come in as a brewer, I'm gonna be able to do stuff.

124
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,572
I'm gonna be able to turn the rocks into gold.

125
00:22:35,572 --> 00:22:40,572
(siren wailing)
(dramatic music)

126
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:47,070
<v ->1995, we began building our brewery here in Brooklyn.</v>

127
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:49,900
The New York Daily News did a big story

128
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:53,520
about the first brewery in Brooklyn in 20 years.

129
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,940
The next day,

130
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:58,260
two big limousines pulled up in front of the brewery.

131
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,670
When they walked in,

132
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:03,170
all the workers disappeared from the job site.

133
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:04,880
You know, the plumbers, the carpenters,

134
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,170
the concrete guys, they were gone.

135
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:10,820
And I said, okay, let me take you guys to lunch.

136
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,950
And there was a diner nearby.

137
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:15,680
And the boss said, no, no, we didn't come here to eat.

138
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,300
Let's meet in your office.

139
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,133
I said well, no,

140
00:23:18,133 --> 00:23:20,200
my office is way back in the warehouse there.

141
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,203
He said, perfect.

142
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:24,070
So we go out in the warehouse,

143
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,750
there aren't enough chairs for the whole group.

144
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,250
I said, let me get some chairs.

145
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:30,670
And the boss said, no, no, you stand up, we'll sit.

146
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:33,720
So the boss sits right in front of me and I'm just,

147
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,430
I'm telling them my background,

148
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:37,610
how we're bootstrapping the company.

149
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:39,330
I'm not sure if we have enough money.

150
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:40,163
At a certain point,

151
00:23:40,163 --> 00:23:42,190
the boss says, look, we've heard enough.

152
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:43,610
We need to talk.

153
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:45,260
I said, okay, I'll leave.

154
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,640
He said, no, no, you stay here.

155
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,310
We'll go up in the warehouse.

156
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,500
And they're out in the warehouse,

157
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,500
like yelling at each other, like screaming, you know.

158
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:56,030
They come charging back in and the boss who's in the lead

159
00:23:56,030 --> 00:24:00,000
puts his hand between my legs and squeezes

160
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,920
and puts his face next to me and says,

161
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,370
we're gonna have to hurt you.

162
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:07,560
And then he grabs me by the shoulders

163
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:11,190
and slams me into the wall and says, just kidding.

164
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:13,090
And he burst out laughing

165
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:15,508
along with the other guys and they left.

166
00:24:15,508 --> 00:24:20,508
(soft music)
(birds chirping)

167
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:31,847
(speaking in foreign language)

168
00:25:15,376 --> 00:25:17,876
(light music)

169
00:26:08,157 --> 00:26:11,240
(machinery whirring)

170
00:27:37,498 --> 00:27:40,081
(upbeat music)

171
00:28:23,996 --> 00:28:27,227
(hops pouring)

172
00:28:27,227 --> 00:28:29,644
(soft music)

173
00:28:41,933 --> 00:28:44,933
(voices clamoring)

174
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:08,560
<v ->A little bit earthy,</v>

175
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,323
not dense, oil-like.

176
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,973
Almost a little bit towards mint or oregano.

177
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:20,423
Just kind of darker green or earthiness.

178
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:27,260
All right, you're in you're with me this time.

179
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:29,130
I am so glad for that.

180
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:35,070
<v ->So I brought a couple of different local beers</v>

181
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,810
for us to try.

182
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:38,740
This is a hazy IPA from The Veil,

183
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,610
and this is a pure butter stout we make

184
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:41,910
at my brewery, Bluejacket.

185
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:47,470
<v ->Everyone that works in beer, has a passion for beer,</v>

186
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:50,143
brews beer, I think has a story.

187
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,240
I worked at CNN, Washington, D.C. bureau,

188
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,120
and I wasn't happy.

189
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,410
I didn't like working in corporate news.

190
00:29:57,410 --> 00:30:00,400
So threw it all to the wind, quit my job at CNN,

191
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,620
my friend Christie quit her job.

192
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:04,870
We traveled cross-country for almost a year.

193
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:05,755
That was the best

194
00:30:05,755 --> 00:30:06,920
trip of my life.

195
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,930
Changed my course.

196
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:10,893
Yeah, that's good, lemon verbena is definitely in there.

197
00:30:12,694 --> 00:30:17,130
And we would go national parks, BLM land, national forest,

198
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:19,930
camp, lived off of $15 a day.

199
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:22,150
What we realized is when we ran out of friends,

200
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:23,850
almost a year, you're gonna run out of friends,

201
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:26,560
who let you sleep on the couch or camp in their backyard.

202
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,010
We always had friends if we went to the brewpubs.

203
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,240
So that's where I really realized

204
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,930
I don't just want to homebrew

205
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:37,010
and get more interested in beer as a beer lover,

206
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:39,000
I want to work in beer.

207
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,600
I moved to Colorado and I became craft beer program director

208
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,458
at the Brewers Association.

209
00:30:44,458 --> 00:30:46,958
(funky music)

210
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,710
<v ->Biked here all the way from the top</v>

211
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:58,363
of Rocky Mountain National Park.

212
00:30:59,749 --> 00:31:01,530
You start in the snow

213
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:06,350
and you bike down and it's like 160 kilometers back home.

214
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:08,217
There's a few Hills here that you have to cross again,

215
00:31:08,217 --> 00:31:11,000
but you pass on this side the reservoir.

216
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,153
And then I live all the way there.

217
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:23,610
<v ->The first time I met Peter,</v>

218
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:25,380
he was a brewmaster at New Belgium already.

219
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,910
And I had just started here.

220
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:30,030
And I remember I was working on a story,

221
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,810
I was trying to explain that style of beer.

222
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:33,455
And I had to do the writing of that.

223
00:31:33,455 --> 00:31:35,100
And Peter does not like to talk about styles.

224
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,370
He's like, what's your style?

225
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:38,770
So, I was kind of intimidated.

226
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:39,930
I'm like, all right, Peter,

227
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:41,510
we're making a beer to Mars at the time,

228
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:44,510
and I said explain this style of beer to me.

229
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:47,450
And he got all excited and he took me across the room

230
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:50,690
and he opened up a book about an architect, Victor Horta.

231
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:52,600
And he showed me this architect's work.

232
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,670
And it's very vinous,

233
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:55,580
so it has very sinewy elements to it,

234
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,270
but very strong structurally.

235
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:58,810
He's like, that is what I want to put in the beer.

236
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:00,290
I want structural integrity,

237
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:01,650
yet I want it to be very organic.

238
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:04,290
And I said, this beer is based on an architect.

239
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:06,810
And he said, absolutely. And he said, and I want the color

240
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:08,280
to look like a Belgian sunset.

241
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,800
And it just blew my mind as to how a brewer

242
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,459
might approach his creative craft.

243
00:32:12,459 --> 00:32:14,876
(soft music)

244
00:32:21,338 --> 00:32:24,920
<v ->A good beer only has three ingredients,</v>

245
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:29,207
knowledge, experience, and creativity in different blends.

246
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,663
There's another little one there.

247
00:32:46,405 --> 00:32:50,905
This is the best place ever in history to be a brewer.

248
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:58,340
Because we educated our customers to try stuff

249
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,800
and they are willing to try.

250
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,210
They're not like in Belgium, oh,

251
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:04,110
I'm gonna drink my Westmalle and my tripel and my dubbel.

252
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,530
That's what I drank, you know?

253
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:07,560
No, they're coming in and they're gonna try,

254
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,150
they're gonna ask for what's new.

255
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:11,170
And so we are now, the brewers here,

256
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:13,355
we can do whatever with beer.

257
00:33:13,355 --> 00:33:14,313
People are gonna try it.

258
00:33:14,313 --> 00:33:15,940
They will comment on it.

259
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:17,170
They will get feedback on it to you,

260
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:21,160
but it's really the best place to do so.

261
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,800
It's also beautiful now to see that with transpired

262
00:33:24,667 --> 00:33:27,360
to other countries, and it goes back to Germany,

263
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,383
it goes back to Belgium, it goes back all over the world.

264
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:36,573
Creating beers takes three years and three months.

265
00:33:37,419 --> 00:33:39,450
There's always stuff happening.

266
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:42,170
And I was looking if there were berries over there

267
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:47,170
and there's always things that you feel smell, eat,

268
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:52,410
talk to people, and those are in the back of your brain.

269
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:56,520
And so those are things that you don't know why

270
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,950
they are useful at this point,

271
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:01,204
but maybe they will come useful after that.

272
00:34:01,204 --> 00:34:03,871
(motor revving)

273
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:17,780
We used to come on Monday together

274
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,580
and we're like, what should we make?

275
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,353
What should we brew?

276
00:34:22,353 --> 00:34:24,023
What are we gonna serve this weekend?

277
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:28,510
We're going to Shaun in the Old Town Spice Store.

278
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:31,550
And we're like, hey, we need something that's fruity

279
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:33,250
with some body.

280
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:35,170
It shouldn't be too exaggerated in

281
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:39,220
the sharpness of the sourness.

282
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:40,780
What do you think?

283
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:43,870
Or we talk with Toby in the chocolate store.

284
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:47,020
And we're like, what type of chocolate husk do you have?

285
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:49,177
And do you have something that's more fruity

286
00:34:49,177 --> 00:34:50,293
and a little bit good.

287
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,113
And he's gonna be,

288
00:34:52,113 --> 00:34:56,320
oh maybe I have some Ecuadorian cafe husk right now.

289
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,870
Give it a try, smell it.

290
00:34:57,870 --> 00:34:59,694
Let's make an infusion right away.

291
00:34:59,694 --> 00:35:02,111
(soft music)

292
00:35:22,244 --> 00:35:25,390
On the brewing side, it's a little bit more different.

293
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:28,100
It's by tasting around that we decide on the brews

294
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,200
that we're gonna make.

295
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:34,040
Sweet little lies and dirty leeks.

296
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,400
And we really wanted to do something with leeks

297
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,440
because that was only thing

298
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,990
that was still in the field in Belgium.

299
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:40,820
And so we bought some leeks

300
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:43,428
and then we started playing in the kitchen.

301
00:35:43,428 --> 00:35:45,540
It was really bad to dry hop.

302
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,820
We dry hopped some beer with it

303
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:49,140
because you get all the sulfur from the leeks.

304
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,070
So we started boiling it.

305
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:53,220
We started doing a hot extraction, like in the mash.

306
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:56,120
And so based on that, we decided to go with a mash.

307
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,890
Mash and boil so that we strip the sulfur off.

308
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:01,460
And then we still had the texture of the leeks.

309
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:04,550
But so, the idea comes from us biking in Belgium

310
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:05,480
and finding leeks.

311
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:08,420
And we're like, oh, we never brewed it with leeks.

312
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,470
Now we get leeks and we're trying to figure out

313
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:12,060
how to work with leeks

314
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:14,090
because there's no brewing book I can pick up

315
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:16,720
that's gonna talk about how to brew with leeks.

316
00:36:20,802 --> 00:36:24,802
(speaking in foreign language)

317
00:37:32,628 --> 00:37:35,128
(funky music)

318
00:39:45,584 --> 00:39:48,334
(drill whirring)

319
00:40:04,683 --> 00:40:07,433
(hammer banging)

320
00:40:25,457 --> 00:40:27,320
<v Man>This is the perfect lambic to make.</v>

321
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:30,850
It goes, we could use your 50% of this one.

322
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:32,190
<v ->Have you noticed?</v>

323
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:33,840
I've been looking at the difference in color,

324
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,850
the difference in aroma.

325
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:35,683
<v ->It tastes much cleaner.</v>

326
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:37,053
<v ->Much cleaner.</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>

327
00:40:40,214 --> 00:40:42,333
<v ->It's getting cold now.</v>

328
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:48,283
It's getting cold now, it will be completely clear.

329
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,730
<v ->So does that mean there's a lot of sediment</v>

330
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:52,740
in these barrels?

331
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,040
<v ->If you would put it in a bucket,</v>

332
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:58,670
you will have half a bucket or less than 5, 6, 7 liters

333
00:40:58,670 --> 00:40:59,963
of yeast, you will find.

334
00:41:00,923 --> 00:41:02,270
Maximum, not more.

335
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:03,910
There is a difference between the casks

336
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:07,500
so that it is not certain that all the cas,s of the same age

337
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:10,053
have the same taste flavors.
<v ->Flavors, yeah.</v>

338
00:41:11,481 --> 00:41:13,898
(soft music)

339
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:31,516
(speaking in foreign language)

340
00:42:43,262 --> 00:42:48,262
(upbeat music)
(machinery whirring)

341
00:44:48,676 --> 00:44:51,259
(bell tolling)

342
00:45:07,346 --> 00:45:10,263
(voices clamoring)

343
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:38,403
<v ->I think you'll find something in lambics</v>

344
00:46:38,403 --> 00:46:41,050
that you don't find in other kind of beers.

345
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:42,507
Of course, you can find the black beers,

346
00:46:42,507 --> 00:46:43,900
that's like a hammer.

347
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:48,497
But the sour thing is just absolutely fantastic for me.

348
00:46:48,497 --> 00:46:50,340
I have some friends in Denmark

349
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:52,267
who's working on beer barrels

350
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:55,620
and we started, yeah with IPAs, and stouts and stuff.

351
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:57,540
And then suddenly they got home,

352
00:46:57,540 --> 00:47:00,260
actually from trips to Belgium with lambic.

353
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:01,910
And we tried it in the bars.

354
00:47:01,910 --> 00:47:04,740
And at first it was really, really strange,

355
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:07,750
but after a few beers and some thinking,

356
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:12,750
suddenly it starts to really mind blow you in some way.

357
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:15,790
And at some point you just need to,

358
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:17,500
you realize you just need to travel to Belgium

359
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:18,500
and try it yourself.

360
00:47:26,287 --> 00:47:29,204
(glass clattering)

361
00:47:32,541 --> 00:47:36,458
(speaking in foreign language)

362
00:47:54,732 --> 00:47:57,732
(voices clamoring)

363
00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:02,920
<v ->I've headed up four breweries for 800 people.</v>

364
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:03,753
<v ->Wow.</v>

365
00:48:03,753 --> 00:48:06,459
<v ->And 68 pubs or something.</v>

366
00:48:06,459 --> 00:48:07,292
<v ->Everybody.</v>

367
00:48:07,292 --> 00:48:08,380
Salute.
<v ->Cheers.</v>

368
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:10,320
(glasses clinking)

369
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,610
<v ->We're here for a week</v>

370
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:13,290
drinking the best beer on the planet.

371
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:15,700
<v ->Yeah, and we're gonna pop open every single beer</v>

372
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:17,460
that we brought.

373
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:20,070
We brought two case's worth of beer here.

374
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:21,830
So if we don't trade 'em,

375
00:48:21,830 --> 00:48:23,860
we're gonna pop 'em open and drink them with, you know,

376
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:25,570
with everybody here.

377
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:26,670
You know, that's what it's about.

378
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:28,040
That's how I made this friend here,

379
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:31,380
by popping open a beer and saying, hey, how you doing?

380
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:32,810
My name is Carlos.

381
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:34,850
Hey, try some of my beer.

382
00:48:34,850 --> 00:48:37,370
And then he tried it and he loved it and (laughing).

383
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:40,640
Now, this is my best buddy here, you know?

384
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:43,210
And we're traveling and, man.

385
00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:45,877
(upbeat music)

386
00:48:56,950 --> 00:49:00,867
(speaking in foreign language)

387
00:51:30,451 --> 00:51:33,284
(easygoing music)

388
00:52:11,273 --> 00:52:13,856
(horn honking)

389
00:53:25,515 --> 00:53:28,182
(upbeat music)

390
00:54:24,638 --> 00:54:25,471
<v ->Hello.</v>

391
00:54:27,046 --> 00:54:27,940
<v ->Peter.</v>
<v ->Hi there.</v>

392
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:28,773
Chris.
<v ->Chris?</v>

393
00:54:28,773 --> 00:54:29,606
<v ->Yes.</v>

394
00:54:29,606 --> 00:54:30,439
Nice to meet you.

395
00:54:30,439 --> 00:54:31,950
<v ->This is Frezi.</v>
<v ->Hello, Chris.</v>

396
00:54:31,950 --> 00:54:33,536
Nice to meet you.
<v ->My wife.</v>

397
00:54:33,536 --> 00:54:34,753
Wanna see the hops, man?

398
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:48,908
(speaking in foreign language)

399
00:54:51,235 --> 00:54:52,705
You know what goat heads are?

400
00:54:52,705 --> 00:54:55,216
<v Chris>Goat heads?</v>

401
00:54:55,216 --> 00:54:56,373
<v ->They came up from the</v>

402
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:01,329
east, so it's such a dry area there.

403
00:55:01,329 --> 00:55:03,310
And then suddenly becoming the valley here of the Yakima.

404
00:55:03,310 --> 00:55:05,970
And there were a lot of grapes initially,

405
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:07,820
but then it starts to switch to hops.

406
00:55:09,370 --> 00:55:10,770
<v ->That's still really green?</v>

407
00:55:13,790 --> 00:55:18,170
<v ->This valley, the Yakima valley, and really from Yakima,</v>

408
00:55:18,170 --> 00:55:21,100
the city of Yakima on until Toppenish,

409
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:24,800
it's all irrigated by the Yakima River.

410
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:26,782
The hop growing is always like that, eh?

411
00:55:26,782 --> 00:55:27,760
<v ->Every year is like that.</v>

412
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:31,130
<v ->A big hit here was when a Budweiser was bought</v>

413
00:55:31,130 --> 00:55:34,910
by ABI, or became ABI, basically.

414
00:55:34,910 --> 00:55:38,290
At that point, they were having a stock of hops

415
00:55:38,290 --> 00:55:40,500
that they kept a strategic reserve

416
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:43,263
and they, especially the elaborates,

417
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:45,900
were suddenly in excess.

418
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:49,250
And you saw so much corn grown in between the fields here.

419
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:50,083
<v ->Really?</v>

420
00:55:50,083 --> 00:55:52,100
<v ->And they've made smaller harvesters</v>

421
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:53,691
so that they could go in between the poles.

422
00:55:53,691 --> 00:55:56,191
(light music)

423
00:56:02,153 --> 00:56:05,070
(water splashing)

424
00:56:16,876 --> 00:56:17,902
<v ->Hi, Eddie.</v>
<v ->Hi, Sue.</v>

425
00:56:17,902 --> 00:56:19,699
<v ->How are ya?</v>
<v ->Great, how are you doing?</v>

426
00:56:19,699 --> 00:56:20,532
<v ->Good.</v>

427
00:56:20,532 --> 00:56:21,365
<v ->Hey, Chris.</v>

428
00:56:21,365 --> 00:56:22,500
<v ->Chris, nice to meet you.</v>

429
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:23,472
I'm Peter.
<v ->Peter.</v>

430
00:56:23,472 --> 00:56:24,305
Pleasure.

431
00:56:24,305 --> 00:56:26,300
<v ->Frezi.</v>
<v ->Frezi, pleasure to meet you.</v>

432
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:27,177
Welcome.

433
00:56:27,177 --> 00:56:28,677
<v All>Thank you.</v>

434
00:56:31,256 --> 00:56:33,923
(both laughing)

435
00:56:43,970 --> 00:56:46,380
<v ->All hops that are grown commercially in the U.S.</v>

436
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:47,520
came over from Europe.

437
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,970
All the new stuff that we've bred since then

438
00:56:49,970 --> 00:56:52,920
has bred with that rootstock and then modern rootstock.

439
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:54,613
<v ->The acres are on this sign?</v>

440
00:56:55,716 --> 00:56:57,297
<v ->Those teepees right there.</v>

441
00:56:57,297 --> 00:56:58,130
Those little endposts,

442
00:56:59,123 --> 00:57:00,870
that separates.

443
00:57:00,870 --> 00:57:03,631
<v ->Okay.</v>
<v ->Just separates 40s.</v>

444
00:57:03,631 --> 00:57:05,470
That switches into Ekuanot right there.

445
00:57:05,470 --> 00:57:07,660
So there's the section of 67 that's.

446
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:08,790
<v ->Mosaic.</v>
<v ->Mosaic.</v>

447
00:57:08,790 --> 00:57:11,040
And then it goes Ekuanot and at the end it's Simcoe.

448
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:12,880
It'll have it like a red bine

449
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:15,521
or kind of like a red striped bine.

450
00:57:15,521 --> 00:57:17,120
But if you look at Ekuanot,

451
00:57:18,673 --> 00:57:20,650
it's just kinda like pale.

452
00:57:20,650 --> 00:57:22,680
Same like Mosaic, Citra.

453
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:23,813
<v ->Yeah, it's like it's diverse.</v>

454
00:57:23,813 --> 00:57:25,620
You have blueberry, you have stone fruit,

455
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:26,700
you have passion fruit,

456
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:28,463
you have a little bit of mango.

457
00:57:29,707 --> 00:57:31,900
It can be a little bit dank as well.

458
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:33,450
And that's why I sorta like it.

459
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,913
And it's always a safe bet to go with Mosaics.

460
00:57:37,070 --> 00:57:38,120
<v ->It's hard to overdo it.</v>

461
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:41,328
And as you can see, just agrinomically, it's.

462
00:57:41,328 --> 00:57:42,161
<v ->It's a good growing hop.</v>

463
00:57:42,161 --> 00:57:43,610
<v ->Yeah, the farmers like to grow it.</v>

464
00:57:44,730 --> 00:57:46,793
Fairly easy to manage, good yields.

465
00:57:46,793 --> 00:57:49,210
(soft music)

466
00:57:55,113 --> 00:57:59,030
(speaking in foreign language)

467
00:58:20,619 --> 00:58:25,619
(machinery whirring)
(energetic music)

468
00:58:42,255 --> 00:58:43,457
<v ->This is the last of it.</v>

469
00:58:43,457 --> 00:58:45,500
We have two fields though today.

470
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:47,960
Only one field that we'll add in.

471
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:52,427
A few hundred acres of Simcoe and 200 are sittin' here.

472
00:59:13,784 --> 00:59:16,534
(horns honking)

473
00:59:23,550 --> 00:59:28,080
<v ->In 1988, when we started selling beer, this bar, Teddy's,</v>

474
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:30,280
was one of our first customers.

475
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:32,830
On day one, we delivered to Teddy's.

476
00:59:32,830 --> 00:59:35,450
It doesn't say Teddy's anywhere here,

477
00:59:35,450 --> 00:59:37,440
but that's what everyone in the neighborhood

478
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,023
knows it by.

479
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:42,670
Actually, it was owned by a brewery

480
00:59:42,670 --> 00:59:44,610
back in the 19th century,

481
00:59:44,610 --> 00:59:47,277
(upbeat music)

482
00:59:50,550 --> 00:59:52,970
You can imagine 30 years ago,

483
00:59:52,970 --> 00:59:56,223
Brooklyn Lager was the only craft beer here.

484
00:59:57,130 --> 01:00:02,130
It was basically Budweiser, Heineken, and Brooklyn Lager.

485
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:06,500
Today, you see there's a little bit of competition

486
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:08,886
among craft beers.

487
01:00:08,886 --> 01:00:11,651
(soft music)

488
01:00:11,651 --> 01:00:15,651
(speaking in foreign language)

489
01:00:36,220 --> 01:00:38,520
<v Narrator>Independence defines us.</v>

490
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:41,050
It's the freedom to create with no limits.

491
01:00:41,050 --> 01:00:44,530
It's the difference between real craft beer and the rest.

492
01:00:44,530 --> 01:00:47,280
For more than 6,000 independent craft breweries,

493
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:50,010
there's a seal that represents that independence.

494
01:00:50,010 --> 01:00:53,508
It marks a community that answers only to beer.

495
01:00:53,508 --> 01:00:55,270
They see the seal, they know

496
01:00:55,270 --> 01:00:57,020
that's independence you're tasting.

497
01:01:04,630 --> 01:01:05,590
<v ->Hey, it's Julia Herz.</v>

498
01:01:05,590 --> 01:01:06,423
How are you?

499
01:01:08,210 --> 01:01:09,043
<v ->I'm good.</v>

500
01:01:09,043 --> 01:01:10,270
Am I catching you at a good time?

501
01:01:10,270 --> 01:01:13,030
The Brewers Association is the national trade group

502
01:01:13,030 --> 01:01:14,700
in the United States that represents

503
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:16,160
the majority of breweries.

504
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:18,143
Frankly, 99% of the beer in the U.S.

505
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:20,830
is under our membership.

506
01:01:20,830 --> 01:01:21,853
Okey-doke, bye bye.

507
01:01:23,350 --> 01:01:25,350
What we launched this morning

508
01:01:27,270 --> 01:01:31,390
is a new campaign on behalf of independent craft brewers

509
01:01:31,390 --> 01:01:34,330
called That's Independent You're Tasting.

510
01:01:34,330 --> 01:01:37,240
The way we launched it is through communications

511
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:41,090
in email that would drive breweries in the United States

512
01:01:42,050 --> 01:01:44,300
to this webpage, which is a blog post.

513
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:46,070
And it talks about the campaign,

514
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:49,050
shows the two commercials that we have produced,

515
01:01:49,050 --> 01:01:52,260
and then also links people to the social media channels

516
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:54,260
that we just launched this morning on Facebook,

517
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:55,400
Instagram, and Twitter.

518
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:57,250
The acquired breweries that are formerly

519
01:01:57,250 --> 01:02:01,750
independent craft brewers that are now part of big beer,

520
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:04,520
they don't have their new parent company name

521
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:05,460
on their labels.

522
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:08,690
There's 10 breweries now under Anheuser-Busch's control

523
01:02:08,690 --> 01:02:10,390
and ownership in the United States.

524
01:02:10,390 --> 01:02:12,140
There's multiple breweries that Molson Coors

525
01:02:12,140 --> 01:02:13,240
has now purchased.

526
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:15,300
Heineken has purchased several.

527
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:19,420
If I was a beer lover and not involved in the beer world,

528
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:21,510
I wouldn't maybe know that, you know,

529
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:23,540
a brewery was purchased.

530
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:25,810
Breckenridge was purchased by Anheuser-Busch,

531
01:02:25,810 --> 01:02:27,620
or Devil's Backbone.

532
01:02:27,620 --> 01:02:29,610
I just wouldn't know that because the name

533
01:02:29,610 --> 01:02:32,160
of the parent company owner is not on those labels.

534
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:33,643
It's not transparent.

535
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:36,360
<v Narrator>The most important thing about choice</v>

536
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:37,880
is that you have one.

537
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:39,860
Independence depends on it.

538
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:42,970
Choice lets you take a stand against the status quo

539
01:02:42,970 --> 01:02:45,870
by catching lightning in a bottle and in turn,

540
01:02:45,870 --> 01:02:47,363
leave your mark on the world.

541
01:02:48,580 --> 01:02:51,780
We're leaving our mark on beer with a seal that represents

542
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:54,800
more than 6,000 independent craft breweries.

543
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:57,773
Seek the seal and know that's independence you're tasting.

544
01:03:02,910 --> 01:03:05,070
<v Julia>Don't you have a calculator that can just tell us?</v>

545
01:03:05,070 --> 01:03:08,567
We have 10 gallons of water and we want 9% alcohol.

546
01:03:09,707 --> 01:03:10,957
It doesn't work that way?

547
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:13,630
<v ->I was just meshing and.</v>

548
01:03:13,630 --> 01:03:14,560
<v ->Go for it.</v>

549
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:15,683
Yeah, so okay.

550
01:03:17,150 --> 01:03:17,983
Yeah, bring it out.

551
01:03:17,983 --> 01:03:20,340
I'm not adding any more water, that I agree with.

552
01:03:22,550 --> 01:03:23,453
Gotta taste it.

553
01:03:24,570 --> 01:03:26,520
Our morning cereal.

554
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:27,360
<v ->That's what I would love in homebrewing</v>

555
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:31,163
because you just can really play around.

556
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:34,120
It doesn't matter if it ingredient costs,

557
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:35,440
like I don't know how much money

558
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:37,223
because you're doing a very small scale.

559
01:03:38,313 --> 01:03:39,833
What is the temperature now?

560
01:03:41,090 --> 01:03:42,180
<v ->I'm gonna call it</v>

561
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:45,713
160.

562
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:49,420
<v ->Do you want to still have some more?</v>

563
01:03:49,420 --> 01:03:51,336
<v ->I don't want it to become stuffed dough.</v>

564
01:03:51,336 --> 01:03:54,086
(grains pouring)

565
01:04:01,051 --> 01:04:02,468
It's mesmerizing.

566
01:04:08,150 --> 01:04:10,550
<v ->This independent logo with the upside down bottle.</v>

567
01:04:10,550 --> 01:04:11,383
<v ->Yeah.</v>

568
01:04:11,383 --> 01:04:12,920
<v ->That's just available for American brewers.</v>

569
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:14,170
<v ->Yeah, only American.</v>

570
01:04:14,170 --> 01:04:16,050
There's no chance as a European brewer just to use it?

571
01:04:16,050 --> 01:04:17,010
<v ->We've been asked.</v>

572
01:04:17,010 --> 01:04:19,930
We've been asked a lot, but it's a certified mark.

573
01:04:19,930 --> 01:04:22,310
You have to be small, independent, traditional

574
01:04:22,310 --> 01:04:25,022
and U.S. craft brewer with TTB.

575
01:04:25,022 --> 01:04:27,735
You have to be licensed to brew as a U.S. brewer.

576
01:04:27,735 --> 01:04:28,568
<v ->Okay.</v>

577
01:04:30,068 --> 01:04:31,235
Chokecherries.

578
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:35,550
<v ->Dries out your mouth.</v>

579
01:04:35,550 --> 01:04:36,383
What do you think?

580
01:04:36,383 --> 01:04:37,930
<v ->I think that could combine well.</v>

581
01:04:37,930 --> 01:04:39,307
<v ->Yeah.</v>

582
01:04:39,307 --> 01:04:41,974
(bright music)

583
01:04:55,689 --> 01:04:56,933
It's a little cloudy.

584
01:04:56,933 --> 01:04:57,860
<v ->But it's still--</v>

585
01:04:57,860 --> 01:05:00,340
<v Julia>It's actually more clear than I would've expected.</v>

586
01:05:00,340 --> 01:05:01,770
<v Chris>It's about flavor, not by style.</v>

587
01:05:01,770 --> 01:05:03,200
<v Julia>That's exactly right.</v>

588
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,360
And we always have to taste it

589
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:06,170
every step in the brewing process.

590
01:05:06,170 --> 01:05:07,710
<v ->Yes, that's true.</v>

591
01:05:07,710 --> 01:05:08,543
<v Both>Cheers.</v>

592
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:12,800
<v ->Ooh, it's good.</v>

593
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:14,450
What I love about brewing with somebody

594
01:05:14,450 --> 01:05:16,870
is you could completely not know them

595
01:05:16,870 --> 01:05:18,852
and you always find common ground.

596
01:05:18,852 --> 01:05:21,686
<v ->And it's not interesting so much that it's gonna be fun.</v>

597
01:05:21,686 --> 01:05:23,400
<v Both>Cheers.</v>

598
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:24,400
<v ->Nice brewing view.</v>

599
01:05:26,190 --> 01:05:28,233
I come over more often if we drink beers like this.

600
01:05:28,233 --> 01:05:29,386
<v ->Yes.
(Chris laughing)</v>

601
01:05:29,386 --> 01:05:32,053
(upbeat music)

602
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:49,930
<v ->We moved to this neighborhood in 1990.</v>

603
01:05:49,930 --> 01:05:54,240
At the time, most of these buildings were abandoned.

604
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:57,570
It was an old industrial area.

605
01:05:57,570 --> 01:06:00,123
Actually our first warehouse was in this building.

606
01:06:02,287 --> 01:06:05,920
When we first opened to the public on Friday night,

607
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:08,890
we'd be lucky to get two dozen people.

608
01:06:08,890 --> 01:06:13,210
And now we get three to 4,000 people in very limited hours

609
01:06:13,210 --> 01:06:15,100
of tours on the weekends.

610
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:19,580
So the brewery has definitely been an economic development

611
01:06:19,580 --> 01:06:21,540
engine for this neighborhood.

612
01:06:21,540 --> 01:06:23,650
And I think that's true of craft breweries

613
01:06:23,650 --> 01:06:25,211
all over the world.

614
01:06:25,211 --> 01:06:27,711
(light music)

615
01:06:31,021 --> 01:06:33,854
(water splashing)

616
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:45,060
<v ->My girlfriend, who's now my wife,</v>

617
01:06:45,060 --> 01:06:47,200
had an apartment right across the street

618
01:06:48,290 --> 01:06:50,690
and I used to sit on her fire escape,

619
01:06:50,690 --> 01:06:53,650
just staring at the building kind of like in a daze.

620
01:06:53,650 --> 01:06:55,800
And she'd be like, what are you looking at?

621
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:01,340
And I'm like, I'm looking at the building.

622
01:07:01,340 --> 01:07:03,303
Someday she's gonna be mine.

623
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:07,440
So this is the old part of the building.

624
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:10,310
This was built in the 1820s

625
01:07:10,310 --> 01:07:13,233
and actually eventually became hat factories and such.

626
01:07:19,820 --> 01:07:23,120
So this is all part of the old factory complex

627
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:24,660
that was here on this property,

628
01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:27,140
mostly because of the creek and the water

629
01:07:27,140 --> 01:07:28,410
and the hydro power.

630
01:07:28,410 --> 01:07:30,550
There was a lot of other buildings that we were looking at

631
01:07:30,550 --> 01:07:32,630
and each building kind of like fell through

632
01:07:32,630 --> 01:07:34,390
kind of like buying a house where it's like,

633
01:07:34,390 --> 01:07:36,680
it just doesn't work out, doesn't work out.

634
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:37,780
And I was really interested

635
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:39,210
in the factory building next door,

636
01:07:39,210 --> 01:07:41,910
but they wanted to turn that into high end condos

637
01:07:41,910 --> 01:07:43,840
and they weren't taking me serious at all.

638
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:46,920
And I came down here angry one day, kind of upset,

639
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:48,340
almost in a way to say goodbye.

640
01:07:48,340 --> 01:07:50,590
I was walking around down here and there was other buildings

641
01:07:50,590 --> 01:07:52,490
and big trees on this property.

642
01:07:52,490 --> 01:07:55,920
And I looked up and I saw this building from the side.

643
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:59,490
I saw the brick character in the old building on one side.

644
01:07:59,490 --> 01:08:01,050
And then I saw this huge factory,

645
01:08:01,050 --> 01:08:03,540
kind of modern industrial building on the side.

646
01:08:03,540 --> 01:08:05,860
And it was just like the drawings that I had sketched

647
01:08:05,860 --> 01:08:06,950
in the beginning.

648
01:08:06,950 --> 01:08:10,220
And in that moment, I romantically fell in love

649
01:08:10,220 --> 01:08:12,790
with this property where it makes your heart

650
01:08:12,790 --> 01:08:13,630
skip a little bit.

651
01:08:13,630 --> 01:08:16,840
And I literally had that moment of this is it.

652
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:19,763
And I knew right away, I just knew it.

653
01:08:31,570 --> 01:08:33,750
My ex was brewing at a small brewery

654
01:08:33,750 --> 01:08:35,840
with our now partner, Jason.

655
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:38,060
And they were creating new styles

656
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:40,460
and being really expressive in their brewing

657
01:08:40,460 --> 01:08:42,400
and kind of pushing some boundaries.

658
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:44,770
<v ->We all had these ideas of like what we want to do</v>

659
01:08:44,770 --> 01:08:45,770
for a real brewery.

660
01:08:45,770 --> 01:08:48,110
Like build this big thing and make it, you know,

661
01:08:48,110 --> 01:08:50,090
something that represents what we love about the area,

662
01:08:50,090 --> 01:08:51,560
what we love about like our hometown.

663
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:53,040
<v ->And it really also comes down to</v>

664
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:56,440
is this is not a one person thing or operation.

665
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:58,160
You need a team

666
01:08:58,160 --> 01:09:01,170
and you need a bunch of different personalities

667
01:09:01,170 --> 01:09:03,330
and skillsets to make this happen.

668
01:09:03,330 --> 01:09:04,547
When you started releasing beers,

669
01:09:04,547 --> 01:09:06,780
you always had this like, okay, we have a release,

670
01:09:06,780 --> 01:09:09,820
let's say Saturday, and there people have to come.

671
01:09:09,820 --> 01:09:11,490
Was it that idea from the beginning?

672
01:09:11,490 --> 01:09:14,100
<v ->We never really tried to have a line outside.</v>

673
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:16,670
But we made beer we liked and we made it the best we could

674
01:09:16,670 --> 01:09:17,520
and people came.

675
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:19,820
And maybe there was a hundred people the first time.

676
01:09:19,820 --> 01:09:21,430
And I remember coming to work that day,

677
01:09:21,430 --> 01:09:24,102
what are all these people doing here?

678
01:09:24,102 --> 01:09:25,520
But that beer was really well-received.

679
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:27,590
And the next one after that, a couple more people came.

680
01:09:27,590 --> 01:09:29,490
And I think by like the third release,

681
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:33,180
we had enough people following us

682
01:09:33,180 --> 01:09:36,480
and knowing what we were doing and kind of raving about it,

683
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:38,320
that there were, you know, close to 500 people

684
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:40,020
wrapping around the building one morning.

685
01:09:40,020 --> 01:09:43,080
<v ->It's not like you're just standing in a line waiting.</v>

686
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:46,520
You're surrounded by all these like-minded individuals.

687
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:48,770
Like you might not have anything in common with them

688
01:09:48,770 --> 01:09:50,830
at the beginning of the day, but by the end of the day,

689
01:09:50,830 --> 01:09:52,230
you all share the same things.

690
01:09:52,230 --> 01:09:53,390
<v ->So they'll come the night before,</v>

691
01:09:53,390 --> 01:09:55,200
they'll meet up with their friends,

692
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:57,680
they'll have beers at our bar, maybe stay in a hotel,

693
01:09:57,680 --> 01:09:58,670
maybe sleep in the car,

694
01:09:58,670 --> 01:10:00,140
come out the next morning

695
01:10:00,140 --> 01:10:01,760
to have some food at the diner down the street

696
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:03,340
and have a couple of beers throughout the day.

697
01:10:03,340 --> 01:10:05,100
<v ->And here you can tell it's super fresh</v>

698
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:06,353
and the conditions you want,

699
01:10:06,353 --> 01:10:08,780
like it's always cold and people take it home

700
01:10:08,780 --> 01:10:10,130
and they're like, we want more.

701
01:10:10,130 --> 01:10:12,340
And then you can communicate directly to the people.

702
01:10:12,340 --> 01:10:14,440
They know your face, they know who's producing it.

703
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:15,273
<v ->It's awesome.</v>

704
01:10:15,273 --> 01:10:17,170
And it's cool for us if we bartend on a Friday night,

705
01:10:17,170 --> 01:10:18,603
we can go outside and like, hey guys, what's up?

706
01:10:18,603 --> 01:10:20,630
There's a few people sitting in chairs

707
01:10:20,630 --> 01:10:22,200
and invite 'em in for a beer and hang.

708
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:24,610
it's like direct person to person kind of interactions

709
01:10:24,610 --> 01:10:26,567
rather than like a bigger thing trickling out.

710
01:10:26,567 --> 01:10:31,567
The way we think about beer is in like two fold,

711
01:10:32,090 --> 01:10:33,950
one, we try to create a product

712
01:10:33,950 --> 01:10:35,650
that is like nostalgic in a way.

713
01:10:35,650 --> 01:10:37,200
So a lot of our fruit forward beers,

714
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:41,690
a lot of our flavors come from childhood memories.

715
01:10:41,690 --> 01:10:44,990
So we want our beers to be like experienced as fun and novel

716
01:10:44,990 --> 01:10:48,430
and creative in a sense of flavor combinations.

717
01:10:48,430 --> 01:10:51,290
On the other side, like some of our more complex beers

718
01:10:51,290 --> 01:10:54,510
we approach the same way, we want flavors that are,

719
01:10:54,510 --> 01:10:57,130
they might be in this shroud of like a really complicated

720
01:10:57,130 --> 01:10:59,900
maybe year old barrel aged sour farmhouse beer.

721
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:02,280
But when you unfold them a little bit, they're familiar.

722
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:04,220
So we try to strike this balance.

723
01:11:04,220 --> 01:11:06,410
And I think this is what good beer is,

724
01:11:06,410 --> 01:11:09,580
is a balance of like a familiarity to it,

725
01:11:09,580 --> 01:11:11,030
but also some kind of like edge,

726
01:11:11,030 --> 01:11:13,220
some sort of novel creative component here.

727
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:15,890
So even our pilsner, you know,

728
01:11:15,890 --> 01:11:18,010
on a day when it's sunny out at you're at the beach,

729
01:11:18,010 --> 01:11:20,040
it drinks just like a Bud Light would, you know.

730
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:21,340
But if you really want to sit down

731
01:11:21,340 --> 01:11:23,090
and think about the pilsner,

732
01:11:23,090 --> 01:11:24,210
there's layers of flavor there

733
01:11:24,210 --> 01:11:27,201
that are like a bigger component of the overall thing.

734
01:11:27,201 --> 01:11:29,784
(bright music)

735
01:11:31,878 --> 01:11:35,878
(speaking in foreign language)

736
01:11:55,462 --> 01:11:57,230
It needs to have like a year

737
01:11:57,230 --> 01:11:58,810
to remain hot for a little while,

738
01:11:58,810 --> 01:12:00,530
and then almost like lager for a little while

739
01:12:00,530 --> 01:12:01,493
and get that again.

740
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:04,420
So yeah, all of these have a very slow

741
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:06,420
and different course of fermentation.

742
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:07,700
<v ->It's all wine barrel here?</v>

743
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:09,630
<v ->These are all red zinfandel barrels.</v>

744
01:12:09,630 --> 01:12:10,713
A couple white wines.

745
01:12:10,713 --> 01:12:12,318
<v ->Zinfandel?</v>
<v ->Zinfandel, yeah,</v>

746
01:12:12,318 --> 01:12:14,273
from the Napa Valley.

747
01:12:16,616 --> 01:12:20,533
(speaking in foreign language)

748
01:12:54,104 --> 01:12:57,104
(forklift whirring)

749
01:12:59,590 --> 01:13:02,090
(light music)

750
01:14:01,877 --> 01:14:04,544
(horn honking)

751
01:14:13,973 --> 01:14:15,900
<v Chris>Watermelon mix sounds nice.</v>

752
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:17,100
<v Vern>It's lighter.</v>

753
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:19,010
It's fresh watermelon.

754
01:14:19,010 --> 01:14:21,630
<v ->Enjoy.</v>
<v ->We've seen styles</v>

755
01:14:21,630 --> 01:14:22,700
we talked about it recently,

756
01:14:22,700 --> 01:14:27,680
we saw an entire Douglas fir tree put into the brew kettle

757
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:29,110
to make a--
<v ->Like a Christmas tree.</v>

758
01:14:29,110 --> 01:14:32,010
<v ->Like a Christmas tree.</v>
<v ->Actual Christmas tree.</v>

759
01:14:32,010 --> 01:14:37,000
<v ->We've seen Chipotle ants from Mexico used in brewing.</v>

760
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,760
<v ->The one rule we do have</v>

761
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:41,440
is that things have to be flavor positive.

762
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:43,860
If it doesn't enhance the flavor of that beer,

763
01:14:43,860 --> 01:14:46,080
whatever that means in the context of that beer,

764
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:48,300
if it doesn't enhance the flavor,

765
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:49,430
you probably shouldn't do it.

766
01:14:49,430 --> 01:14:50,660
If I got a piece of the moon

767
01:14:50,660 --> 01:14:53,950
and threw in a tiny bit of the moon, if you can't taste it,

768
01:14:53,950 --> 01:14:54,930
then what are we really?

769
01:14:54,930 --> 01:14:56,340
We're just marketing at that point.

770
01:14:56,340 --> 01:14:57,275
We're saying it's there.

771
01:14:57,275 --> 01:14:59,680
<v ->Take the ornaments off the Christmas tree.</v>

772
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:02,416
<v ->If they taste good, throw them in. (Chris laughing)</v>

773
01:15:02,416 --> 01:15:03,916
There's just not really a rule

774
01:15:15,460 --> 01:15:16,650
<v ->Into the catacombs.</v>

775
01:15:16,650 --> 01:15:18,990
That idea of like really people going to the source of beer,

776
01:15:18,990 --> 01:15:20,870
but driving five states to get it.

777
01:15:20,870 --> 01:15:23,880
That's a weird new thing for us.

778
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:25,860
I keep waiting for this generation of 22 year olds,

779
01:15:25,860 --> 01:15:27,920
that as soon as they have kids and get married,

780
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:29,490
the amount of time you have to wait in line

781
01:15:29,490 --> 01:15:31,260
and drink and have downtime,

782
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:32,520
they're gonna come back to the other beers.

783
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:34,863
Pils is gonna come back big. As soon as they have kids,

784
01:15:34,863 --> 01:15:36,340
they're like I just want a beer please.

785
01:15:36,340 --> 01:15:37,847
My kid's sleeping.

786
01:15:37,847 --> 01:15:40,430
(upbeat music)

787
01:15:42,292 --> 01:15:45,209
(voices clamoring)

788
01:15:47,851 --> 01:15:51,768
(speaking in foreign language)

789
01:16:01,239 --> 01:16:02,805
(hammer banging)

790
01:16:02,805 --> 01:16:05,972
(audience applauding)

791
01:16:53,142 --> 01:16:55,809
(somber music)

792
01:16:59,047 --> 01:17:02,220
<v ->There is a gulf in the way that the companies think,</v>

793
01:17:02,220 --> 01:17:03,710
on that global level,

794
01:17:03,710 --> 01:17:07,460
they can hide malpractice in another continent

795
01:17:07,460 --> 01:17:11,350
and pretend that that being awesome and upright in Europe

796
01:17:11,350 --> 01:17:14,260
whilst they're being destructive in Africa, for example.

797
01:17:14,260 --> 01:17:18,990
This is not something that a traditional brewery

798
01:17:18,990 --> 01:17:20,440
would aspire to replicate,

799
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:22,750
nor is it something that a craft brewer

800
01:17:22,750 --> 01:17:23,750
aspire to replicate.

801
01:17:29,908 --> 01:17:32,991
(machinery whirring)

802
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:59,840
Being rated second best brewer in the world

803
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:02,833
was absurd and really took us by surprise.

804
01:18:04,890 --> 01:18:06,650
We don't make beer.

805
01:18:06,650 --> 01:18:10,240
That's not what people are coming to us to consume.

806
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:13,030
If we were just thinking about making beer alone,

807
01:18:13,030 --> 01:18:15,410
we would be running a very different type of business

808
01:18:15,410 --> 01:18:17,203
for a very different set of people.

809
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:19,470
I think people come here

810
01:18:19,470 --> 01:18:22,000
because they want to drink our values

811
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,470
and they want to drink the values that they hold dear to,

812
01:18:24,470 --> 01:18:28,930
so that those values of independence, of community focus,

813
01:18:28,930 --> 01:18:30,613
you know, ethical business,

814
01:18:32,070 --> 01:18:35,208
these things and more at what people are really consuming.

815
01:18:35,208 --> 01:18:40,208
(funky music)
(birds chirping)

816
01:18:42,928 --> 01:18:47,900
<v ->ABI and MillerCoors have lost 30 million barrels</v>

817
01:18:47,900 --> 01:18:52,890
of production in the United States in the last 10 years.

818
01:18:52,890 --> 01:18:55,120
And a lot of that of course,

819
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:57,350
has been taken up by craft brewers.

820
01:18:57,350 --> 01:18:59,360
In the United States,

821
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:04,360
independent craft is like 13% of the U.S. market now

822
01:19:04,900 --> 01:19:05,740
in volume.

823
01:19:05,740 --> 01:19:08,740
By dollars, it's like 24%.

824
01:19:08,740 --> 01:19:12,130
If you add in the mega craft brands,

825
01:19:12,130 --> 01:19:16,910
it's probably close to 30% dollars of the U.S. market.

826
01:19:16,910 --> 01:19:20,590
Imports are probably about 24%

827
01:19:20,590 --> 01:19:22,330
of dollars in the U.S. market.

828
01:19:22,330 --> 01:19:25,070
So better beer, beer with flavor,

829
01:19:25,070 --> 01:19:28,620
is more than 50% of the U.S. market.

830
01:19:28,620 --> 01:19:31,170
<v ->There are three brewers, big brewers,</v>

831
01:19:31,170 --> 01:19:36,170
and basically they consolidate 50% of the beer volume,

832
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:40,380
the beer production on Earth, planet Earth,

833
01:19:40,380 --> 01:19:43,810
70% of profits, just three brewers.

834
01:19:43,810 --> 01:19:48,760
And then there are almost 19,000 other brewers.

835
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:50,170
And I think this phenomenon

836
01:19:50,170 --> 01:19:52,640
is not a beer-related phenomenon.

837
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:56,480
I think it's basically a humanity.

838
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:58,520
I mean a 21st century phenomenon.

839
01:19:58,520 --> 01:20:02,760
If you allow me, there's also an non-economic impact

840
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:06,420
of that phenomenon, which has to do with the human nature

841
01:20:06,420 --> 01:20:07,940
and who we are.

842
01:20:07,940 --> 01:20:10,313
Are we the creative human beings?

843
01:20:11,150 --> 01:20:13,170
Especially this is a very relevant discussion

844
01:20:13,170 --> 01:20:15,690
with the artificial intelligence coming.

845
01:20:15,690 --> 01:20:18,660
So are we or are we homo creativus

846
01:20:18,660 --> 01:20:21,990
or are we becoming consumers?

847
01:20:21,990 --> 01:20:26,590
<v ->We all grew up basically getting taught</v>

848
01:20:26,590 --> 01:20:28,600
you need to finish your school,

849
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:30,290
you need to finish your university,

850
01:20:30,290 --> 01:20:32,490
you need to finish your master's.

851
01:20:32,490 --> 01:20:36,460
You need to get in the best position in the best company

852
01:20:36,460 --> 01:20:40,570
to get a nice salary to one day get married

853
01:20:40,570 --> 01:20:43,640
and to have kids and a car and a family and so and so.

854
01:20:43,640 --> 01:20:47,910
Which is basically the comfort zone for every human being.

855
01:20:47,910 --> 01:20:50,260
Everyone likes to be in the comfort zone.

856
01:20:50,260 --> 01:20:54,790
So I followed this whole thing, finished my school, my uni,

857
01:20:54,790 --> 01:20:56,010
so, so, so,

858
01:20:56,010 --> 01:20:58,400
started joining really the companies.

859
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:00,510
Then I went from a junior position

860
01:21:00,510 --> 01:21:02,290
to a really nice big position

861
01:21:02,290 --> 01:21:05,520
that I was earning actually good amount of money.

862
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:09,000
But during this whole 13 years of working for a corporation,

863
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:13,150
I lost a lot of my manners.

864
01:21:13,150 --> 01:21:15,800
I lost a lot of my personality

865
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:19,320
because in the corporate life, there's no mercy.

866
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:20,840
Well, it doesn't exist.

867
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:23,920
So that's why I was always hating to be in a corporate life

868
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:26,000
because it kills your creativity.

869
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,970
It kills what you actually want to do.

870
01:21:27,970 --> 01:21:30,730
It kills your morals that you grew up.

871
01:21:30,730 --> 01:21:32,030
It change your personality.

872
01:21:32,030 --> 01:21:34,637
It change how you actually should be.

873
01:21:34,637 --> 01:21:37,387
(hammer banging)

874
01:21:47,790 --> 01:21:49,820
<v ->In your bedroom, I had a lot of opportunities,</v>

875
01:21:49,820 --> 01:21:51,520
but in the end it gets pretty large

876
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:54,277
and I've always felt like a small brewer.

877
01:21:55,720 --> 01:21:59,100
I got stuck in meetings and other people had the fun for me.

878
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:01,300
I'm like, maybe I should have the fun again.

879
01:22:03,710 --> 01:22:07,180
I talked with a lot of other brewery owners

880
01:22:07,180 --> 01:22:08,930
and it was really beautiful to discover

881
01:22:08,930 --> 01:22:11,220
what was happening in American craft

882
01:22:11,220 --> 01:22:14,133
and what niche could I fill in now?

883
01:22:16,530 --> 01:22:18,993
I chose really to go very, very small.

884
01:22:30,830 --> 01:22:32,100
Currently we're the smallest one

885
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:34,223
from the 22 breweries in our town.

886
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:39,010
We are complete rotators.

887
01:22:39,010 --> 01:22:41,850
Our beers are always new every weekend.

888
01:22:41,850 --> 01:22:43,100
We're only on the weekend open.

889
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:44,633
We only have four new beers.

890
01:22:46,050 --> 01:22:47,253
So slight sour bit.

891
01:22:48,230 --> 01:22:49,380
Every weekend.

892
01:22:49,380 --> 01:22:50,663
Sun-dried tomato.

893
01:22:51,860 --> 01:22:53,203
Exclamation mark.

894
01:22:56,774 --> 01:22:57,607
Whoa.

895
01:23:05,917 --> 01:23:09,000
(machinery whirring)

896
01:23:20,553 --> 01:23:24,470
(speaking in foreign language)

897
01:23:39,249 --> 01:23:41,749
(funky music)

898
01:24:40,690 --> 01:24:45,690
(audience applauding)
(bright music)

899
01:25:11,321 --> 01:25:16,321
âª When I was younger, I knew where I wanted to go âª

900
01:25:18,774 --> 01:25:23,774
âª I set my dreams, set my path, and set my goals âª

901
01:25:25,020 --> 01:25:27,907
âª And those goals ruined my way âª

902
01:25:27,907 --> 01:25:32,210
âª I should have stuck it out, gave up anyway âª

903
01:25:32,210 --> 01:25:34,356
âª 'Cause all my life all I knew âª

904
01:25:34,356 --> 01:25:37,981
âª Is that's my destiny âª

905
01:25:37,981 --> 01:25:40,723
âª You see âª

906
01:25:40,723 --> 01:25:43,979
âª Party people never gave up âª

907
01:25:43,979 --> 01:25:46,106
âª Never gave up âª

908
01:25:46,106 --> 01:25:47,716
âª Never gave up âª

909
01:25:47,716 --> 01:25:49,691
âª Never gave up âª

01:25:49,691 --> 01:25:51,343
âª Never gave up âª

01:25:51,343 --> 01:25:53,372
âª Never gave up âª

912
01:25:53,372 --> 01:25:56,039
âª Never gave up âª

913
01:26:10,377 --> 01:26:12,358
âª In all the years that have passed âª

914
01:26:12,358 --> 01:26:17,358
âª I'll now think back âª

915
01:26:17,650 --> 01:26:19,690
âª I've got no worry for his soul âª

916
01:26:19,690 --> 01:26:23,785
âª Just after when âª

917
01:26:23,785 --> 01:26:26,853
âª And those things really in my way âª

918
01:26:26,853 --> 01:26:31,178
âª I just knew that I would give up anyway âª

919
01:26:31,178 --> 01:26:33,510
âª 'Cause all my life all I knew âª

920
01:26:33,510 --> 01:26:36,991
âª Is that's my destiny âª

921
01:26:36,991 --> 01:26:39,955
âª You see âª

922
01:26:39,955 --> 01:26:41,542
