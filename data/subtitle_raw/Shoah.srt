RUTH ELIAS (ISRAEL)

2
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,600
Crematorium V

3
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,800
At the end of February,

4
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,400
I was in a night squad
at Crematorium V.

5
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,400
Around midnight,
there appeared

6
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,600
a man from
the political section:

7
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,800
Oberscharfuhrer Hustek.

8
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:22,700
He handed Oberscharfuhrer
Voss a note.

9
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:34,600
Voss was then in charge

10
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,200
of the 4 crematoria.

11
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,900
I saw

12
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,800
Voss unfold the note

13
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,400
and talk to himself,
saying, "Sure, always Voss.

14
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:02,300
"What'd they do without Voss?
How can we do it?"

15
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,400
That's how he talked
to himself.

16
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:08,400
Suddenly he told me,
"Go get the kapos".

17
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:12,600
I fetched the kapos,
kapo Schloime,

18
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,700
and kapo Wacek.

19
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,800
They came in,
and he asked them:

20
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,700
"How many pieces
are left?"

21
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,500
By "pieces" he meant bodies.

22
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:28,700
They told him:
"Around 500 pieces."

23
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,200
He said: "By morning,
those 500 pieces must be

24
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,200
"reduced to ashes.

25
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,700
"You're sure it's 500?"

26
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,800
"Just about", they said.

27
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:50,000
"Assholes! What do you mean
"just about"?"

28
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,600
Then he left

29
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:57,600
for the "undressing room"
to see for himself.

30
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,200
Where the bodies were.

31
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,700
They were piled there:

32
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,900
At Crematorium V, the
"Undressing room" also serve

33
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,400
as a warehouse for bodies

34
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,100
After the gassing?

35
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:13,000
After the gassing the bodies
were dragged there.

36
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,200
Voss went there to check.

37
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,600
He forgot the note

38
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,300
leaving it on the table.

39
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,000
I quickly scanned it

40
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,700
and was shocked
by what I read.

41
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,200
BIRKENAU
The lake of ashes

42
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:47,300
The crematorium was
to be gotten ready

43
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:55,500
for "special treatment"
of the Czech family camp.

44
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,100
In the morning, when
the day squad came on,

45
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,700
I ran into kapo Kaminski,

46
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:18,800
one of the Resistance
leaders in the "special detail"

47
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,900
and told him the news.

48
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,400
He informed me

49
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,700
that Crematorium II

50
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,400
was also being prepared.

51
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,300
That the ovens were
ready there, too.

52
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,800
And he exhorted me:

53
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:51,900
"You have friends
and fellow-countrymen.

54
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:58,000
"Go see them. They're
locksmiths and can move around

55
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,400
"so they can go
to Camp B II B.

56
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,200
"Tell them to warn
these people

57
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,800
"of what's
in store for them

58
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,600
"and say that if they defend
themselves, we'll reduce

59
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:15,700
"the crematoria to ashes.

60
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:20,800
"And at camp B II B,
they can immediately

61
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,200
"burn down
their barracks."

62
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,100
We were certain
that the next night,

63
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,600
these people
would be gassed.

64
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:38,900
But when no night squad
went out, we were relieved.

65
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,000
The deadline had been

66
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:47,300
postponed for a few days.

67
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,500
But many prisoners,
including the Czechs

68
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:56,500
in the family camp,
accused us of spreading panic

69
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,100
of having

70
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,000
circulated

71
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,800
false reports.

72
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:11,500
That night I was
at Crematorium II.

73
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:22,500
As soon as the people
got out of the vans,

74
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,300
they were blinded
by floodlights

75
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,800
and forced through
a corridor

76
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,500
to the stairs leading to
the "undressing room".

77
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:40,400
They were blinded,
made to run.

78
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,900
Blows were rained on them.

79
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:48,400
Those who didn't run fast
enough were beaten to death.

80
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,700
By the SS.

81
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:55,700
The violence used against
them was extraordinary.

82
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,100
And suddenly...

83
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,000
Without explanation?

84
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:05,500
Not a word. As soon as
they left the vans,

85
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,600
the beatings began.

86
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:13,300
When they entered
the "undressing room",

87
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:17,000
I was standing near
the rear door,

88
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,900
and from there

89
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:25,200
I witnessed
the frightful scene.

90
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,500
The people were bloodied.

91
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,700
They knew
then where they were.

92
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,700
They stared at the pillars
of the so-called

93
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:42,200
"International Information
Center" I've mentioned,

94
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,700
and that terrified them.

95
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,600
What they read
didn't reassure them.

96
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,800
On the contrary,
it panicked them.

97
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:54,200
They knew the score.
They'd learned

98
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:58,500
at Camp B II B
what went on there.

99
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:02,700
They were in despair.
Children clung to each other.

100
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,500
Their mothers,

101
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,300
their parents,
the old people all cried,

102
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,900
overcome with misery.

103
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,300
Suddenly,

104
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:18,900
some SS officers appeared
on the steps,

105
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:25,700
including the camp
commandant, Schwarzhuber.

106
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,900
He'd given them his word
as an SS officer

107
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,000
that they'd be

108
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,000
transferred
to Heidebreck.

109
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,800
So they all began

110
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,400
to cry out,
to beg, shouting:

111
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:49,100
"Heidebreck was a trick!

112
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:53,900
"We were lied to! We want
to live! We want to work!"

113
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:58,900
They looked their SS
executioners in the eye,

114
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,800
but the SS men

115
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,500
remained impassive,

116
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:11,200
just staring at them. There
was a movement in the crowd.

117
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:16,300
They probably wanted
to rush to the SS men

118
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,000
and tell them how
they'd been lied to,

119
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:23,900
then some guards
surged forward,

120
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:27,500
wielding clubs,

121
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,300
and more people
were injured.

122
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,700
In the "undressing room"?

123
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,000
Yes.

124
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,300
The violence climaxed

125
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:43,700
when they tried to force
the people to undress.

126
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,800
A few obeyed,

127
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:49,100
only a handful.

128
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:55,300
Most of them refused
to follow the order.

129
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:59,400
Suddenly, as though
in chorus

130
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:07,500
like a chorus...
they all began to sing.

131
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:14,000
The whole "undressing room"
rang

132
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:18,200
with the Czech
national anthem,

133
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,400
and the "Hatikva".

134
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:25,600
That moved me terribly,
that...

135
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,800
Please stop!

136
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:51,600
That was happening
to my countrymen,

137
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,000
and I realized

138
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:58,400
that my life
had become meaningless.

139
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,200
Why go on living?
For what?

140
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:09,200
So I went into
the gas-chamber with them,

141
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,800
resolved to die.

142
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,600
With them.

143
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:23,900
Suddenly, some who recognize
me came up to me. For

144
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,800
my locksmith friends
and I had sometimes

145
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:31,000
gone into
the family camp.

146
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:38,100
A small group
of women approached.

147
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:44,100
They looked at me and said
right there in the gas-chamber.

148
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,600
You were inside
the gas-chamber?

149
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
One of them said:

150
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,700
"So you want to die.
But that's senseless.

151
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:02,400
"Your death won't give us
back our lives.

152
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,500
"That's no way.

153
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:11,200
"You must get out of
here alive,

154
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:16,200
"you must bear witness
to our suffering,

155
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,800
"and to the injustice
done to us."

156
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:07,300
RUDOLF VRBA
and h is friend WETZLER

157
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:11,200
escaped on April 7, 1944.

158
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:14,200
Several prisoners had previously
tried to flee, but all were caught.

159
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:31,800
JAN KARSKY,

Next figure:
Dr FRANZ GRASSLER,

168
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:25,700
the Nazi Commissioner
of the WARS AW ghetto.

169
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:57,400
You don't remember
those days?

170
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:01,600
Not much.

171
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:07,100
I recall more clearly
my pre-war

172
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:09,200
mountaineering trips than
the entire war period

173
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:11,800
and those days in Warsaw.

174
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:19,500
All in all,
those were bad times.

175
01:17:22,900 --> 01:17:27,100
It's a fact: We tend
to forget, thank God,

176
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:31,100
the bad times more easily
than the good.

177
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,400
The bad times
are repressed.

178
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:47,300
I'll help you remember...

179
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:57,800
In Warsaw you were
Dr. Auerswald's deputy.

180
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:00,200
Yes.

181
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:05,000
Dr. Auerswald was...

182
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:08,200
Commissioner of the
"Jewish district" of Warsaw.

183
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:15,300
Dr. Grassler, this is
Czerniakow's diary.

184
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:17,000
You're mentioned in it.

185
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:19,200
It's been printed,
it exists?

186
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:22,800
He kept a diary

187
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:28,600
that was recently
published.

188
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:38,800
He wrote on July 7, 1941:

189
01:18:39,700 --> 01:18:44,300
July 7, 1941? That's the
first time I've re-learned a date.

190
01:18:46,900 --> 01:18:48,900
May I take notes?

191
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:52,500
After all...
it interests me too.

192
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:56,800
So in July I was
already there!

193
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:02,400
He wrote on July 7, 1941:

194
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:08,600
"Morning in the Community"
- the Jewish Council HQ...

195
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:13,400
"and later with
Auerswald, Schlosser..."

196
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:15,600
Schlosser was...

197
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
"And Grassler,

198
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:23,100
"on routine matters."

199
01:19:23,900 --> 01:19:25,900
That's the first time...

200
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:28,100
That my name is mentioned...

201
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:31,600
Yes, but there were 3 of us.

202
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:34,400
Schlosser... was in...
the "economic department".

203
01:19:34,700 --> 01:19:38,200
I think he had to do
with economics.

204
01:19:39,100 --> 01:19:42,700
And the second time

205
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:47,400
was on July 22.

206
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:53,500
C ZERN IAKOW was president
of the Warsaw Jewish Council

207
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,700
He wrote every day?

208
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,400
Yes.

209
01:19:58,700 --> 01:20:00,600
Yes, every day.

210
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:03,300
It's quite amazing

211
01:20:04,700 --> 01:20:06,900
that the diary was saved.

212
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:10,000
It's amazing
that it was saved.

213
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:19,300
BURLINGTON - VERMONT
(U.S.A.)

214
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:17,900
RAUL HILBERG

215
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:44,000
Did you go
into the ghetto?

216
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:47,700
Seldom. When I had
to visit Czerniakow.

217
01:26:49,100 --> 01:26:52,200
What were
the conditions like?

218
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:55,700
Awful. Yes, appalling.

219
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:56,900
Yes?

220
01:26:57,200 --> 01:27:02,300
I never went back when
I saw what it was like.

221
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:06,000
Unless I had to:
In the whole period

222
01:27:06,300 --> 01:27:08,900
I think I only went
once or twice.

223
01:27:11,300 --> 01:27:13,500
We, at the Commission,
tried

224
01:27:13,900 --> 01:27:19,100
to maintain the ghetto
for its labor force,

225
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:22,800
and especially to prevent
epidemic, like typhus.

226
01:27:23,100 --> 01:27:25,800
That was the big danger.

227
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:31,900
Yes.

228
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:33,000
Yes?

229
01:27:33,300 --> 01:27:36,200
Can you tell us
about typhus?

230
01:27:38,300 --> 01:27:41,600
I'm not a doctor.
I only know that typhus

231
01:27:41,900 --> 01:27:44,700
is a very dangerous
epidemic

232
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:49,700
that wipes people out
like the plague,

233
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,700
and that it can't be
confined to a ghetto.

234
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:57,200
If typhus had broken out...
I don't think it did,

235
01:27:57,500 --> 01:28:00,500
but there was fear
that if might...

236
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:02,800
it would have it the Poles
and the Germans.

237
01:28:03,100 --> 01:28:06,700
Why was there typhus
in the ghetto?

238
01:28:06,900 --> 01:28:08,800
I don't know if there was,

239
01:28:09,100 --> 01:28:12,500
but there was a danger,
because of the famine.

240
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:15,600
People didn't get
enough to eat.

241
01:28:15,900 --> 01:28:19,600
That's what was so awful.

242
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:24,700
We at the Commission,

243
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:28,700
did our best to feed
the ghetto,

244
01:28:29,100 --> 01:28:35,700
so it wouldn't become
an incubator of epidemics.

245
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:40,800
Aside from humanitarian
factors, that's what mattered.

246
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:46,200
If typhus had broken out...
and it didn't...

247
01:28:46,300 --> 01:28:49,500
it wouldn't have stopped
at the ghetto.

248
01:28:50,300 --> 01:28:53,100
Czerniakow also wrote:

249
01:28:53,300 --> 01:28:59,300
That one of the reasons
the ghetto was walled in

250
01:28:59,900 --> 01:29:02,400
was because
of this German fear.

251
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:05,800
Yes, absolutely!
Fear of typhus.

252
01:29:06,100 --> 01:29:12,400
He says Germans always
associated Jews with typhus.

253
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:17,300
Maybe. I'm not sure if there
were grounds for it.

254
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:21,000
But imagine that mass
of people

255
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:24,400
packed in the ghetto...
There weren't only

256
01:29:24,700 --> 01:29:28,300
the Warsaw Jews,
but others who came later.

257
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:31,200
The danger kept
on growing.

258
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:43,700
The Germans had a policy
on the Warsaw ghetto.

259
01:32:46,100 --> 01:32:48,200
What was that policy?

260
01:32:51,300 --> 01:32:53,800
You're asking
more than I know.

261
01:32:54,100 --> 01:32:57,600
The policy that wound up
with extermination,

262
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:02,200
the Final Solution...
we knew nothing about it.

263
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:05,100
Our job was
to maintain the ghetto,

264
01:33:05,400 --> 01:33:09,800
and try to preserve
the Jews as a work force.

265
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:13,300
The Commission's goal,

266
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:17,000
in fact, was
very different from

267
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:23,100
the one that later
led to extermination.

268
01:33:24,500 --> 01:33:27,400
Yes, but do you know
how many people died

269
01:33:27,700 --> 01:33:30,800
in the ghetto
each month in 1941?

270
01:33:31,100 --> 01:33:34,000
I don't know now...
if I ever knew it.

271
01:33:34,300 --> 01:33:38,200
But you did know.
There are exact figures.

272
01:33:40,100 --> 01:33:42,400
I probably knew...

273
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:45,700
Yes: 5,000 a month.

274
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,200
5,000 a month? Yes, well...

275
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:49,500
That's a lot.

276
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:52,900
That's a lot, of course.
But there were

277
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:57,200
far too many people in
the ghetto. That was it.

278
01:33:57,800 --> 01:33:58,700
Far too many.

279
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,900
Far too many.

280
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:10,100
My question is philosophical.

281
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:14,800
What does a ghetto mean,
in your opinion?

282
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:22,400
History's full of ghettos,

283
01:34:22,700 --> 01:34:25,900
going back centuries,
for all I know.

284
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:32,900
Persecution of the Jews
wasn't a German invention,

285
01:34:33,300 --> 01:34:36,100
and it didn't start
with World War II.

286
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,200
The Poles persecuted
them too.

287
01:34:45,700 --> 01:34:50,300
But a ghetto like Warsaw's,
in a great capital,

288
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:53,400
in the heart of the city

289
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:55,600
that was unusual.

290
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:07,300
You say you wanted
to maintain the ghetto.

291
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:12,000
Our mission wasn't
to annihilate the ghetto,

292
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:15,300
but to keep it alive,
to maintain it.

293
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:18,900
What does "alive"
mean in such

294
01:35:19,200 --> 01:35:20,800
That was the problem.

295
01:35:21,100 --> 01:35:25,600
That was the whole problem...

296
01:35:25,900 --> 01:35:29,800
But people were dying
in the streets.

297
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:32,200
There were bodies everywhere.

298
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,000
Yes.

299
01:35:35,900 --> 01:35:38,200
That was the paradox.

300
01:35:38,500 --> 01:35:40,300
You see it as a paradox?

301
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:42,200
I'm sure of it.

302
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:45,900
Why? Can you explain?

303
01:35:46,300 --> 01:35:47,400
No.

304
01:35:48,700 --> 01:35:49,800
Why not?

305
01:35:50,100 --> 01:35:53,800
Explain what?

306
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:57,300
But the fact is...

307
01:35:57,600 --> 01:36:01,500
Jews were being exterminated
daily in the ghetto.

308
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:03,900
Czerniakow wrote...

309
01:36:04,200 --> 01:36:07,600
To maintain it properly
we'd have needed

310
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:09,600
more substantial rations,

311
01:36:09,900 --> 01:36:12,200
and less crowding.

312
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:17,400
Why weren't the rations
more humane?

313
01:36:19,800 --> 01:36:21,800
Why weren't they?

314
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:25,300
That was a German
decision, no?

315
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:28,200
There was no real decision

316
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:30,800
to starve the ghetto.

317
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:37,100
The big decision to
exterminate came much later.

318
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:40,900
That's right, later.
In 1942.

319
01:36:42,600 --> 01:36:43,600
Precisely!

320
01:36:43,900 --> 01:36:45,700
3 years later.

321
01:36:45,900 --> 01:36:49,900
Just so. Our mission,
as I recall it,

322
01:36:51,100 --> 01:36:54,800
was to manage the ghetto,

323
01:36:55,900 --> 01:36:59,800
and, naturally, with those
inadequate rations,

324
01:37:00,200 --> 01:37:02,100
and the overcrowding,

325
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:08,500
a high, even excessive,
death rate was inevitable.

326
01:37:09,800 --> 01:37:10,800
Yes.

327
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:17,800
What does "maintain" the
ghetto mean in such condition...

328
01:37:18,100 --> 01:37:21,500
the food, sanitation, etc?

329
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:26,300
What would the Jews do
against such measures?

330
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,100
They couldn't do anything.

331
01:40:31,100 --> 01:40:35,100
The Final Solution Conference
was held here

332
01:42:26,200 --> 01:42:30,600
BELZEC - Site
of the extermination camp

333
01:44:14,400 --> 01:44:18,300
Why did Czerniakow
commit suicide?

334
01:44:19,500 --> 01:44:22,200
Because he realized

335
01:44:22,500 --> 01:44:26,300
there was no future
for the ghetto.

336
01:44:26,600 --> 01:44:31,400
He probably saw before I did
that the Jews would be killed.

337
01:44:34,100 --> 01:44:37,600
I suppose the Jews
already had

338
01:44:38,700 --> 01:44:41,400
their excellent
secret services.

339
01:44:41,700 --> 01:44:46,100
They were too well informed,
better than we were.

340
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:47,400
Think so?

341
01:44:47,500 --> 01:44:48,600
Yes, I do.

342
01:44:48,900 --> 01:44:51,100
The Jews knew more than you?

343
01:44:51,400 --> 01:44:53,100
I'm convinced of it!

344
01:44:53,400 --> 01:44:56,400
It's hard to believe.

345
01:44:56,800 --> 01:45:00,500
The German administration
was never informed

346
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:04,000
of what would happened
to the Jews.

347
01:45:07,900 --> 01:45:11,300
When was the first
deportation to Treblinka?

348
01:45:18,400 --> 01:45:21,700
Before Auerswald's suicide,
I think.

349
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:24,200
Auerswald's?

350
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:27,300
I mean Czerniakow's. Sorry.

351
01:45:28,300 --> 01:45:30,200
July 22.

352
01:45:31,300 --> 01:45:34,600
Those are dates...

353
01:45:35,400 --> 01:45:39,400
So the deportations began
July 22, 1942.

354
01:45:39,700 --> 01:45:41,100
Yes.

355
01:45:42,500 --> 01:45:43,600
To... Treblinka.

356
01:45:43,900 --> 01:45:47,800
And Czerniakow killed
himself July 23.

357
01:45:48,700 --> 01:45:50,300
Yes, that is...

358
01:45:50,600 --> 01:45:51,500
The next day.

359
01:45:51,800 --> 01:45:54,400
The next day. So that was it,
he'd realized

360
01:45:54,700 --> 01:45:58,800
that his idea...
It was his idea, I think

361
01:45:59,100 --> 01:46:02,600
of working in good faith
with the Germans,

362
01:46:02,800 --> 01:46:06,400
in the Jews' best interests.

363
01:46:06,700 --> 01:46:12,100
He'd realized this idea,
this dream, was destroyed.

364
01:46:12,500 --> 01:46:15,400
That the idea was a dream.

365
01:46:15,700 --> 01:46:18,600
Yes. And when
the dream faded,

366
01:46:18,900 --> 01:46:21,400
he took the logical way out.

367
01:51:14,500 --> 01:51:19,000
Did you think this idea
of a ghetto was a good one?

368
01:51:19,100 --> 01:51:21,000
A sort of self-management,
right?

369
01:51:21,300 --> 01:51:22,300
That's right.

370
01:51:22,600 --> 01:51:24,500
A mini-State?

371
01:51:24,800 --> 01:51:27,000
It worked well.

372
01:51:27,900 --> 01:51:31,000
But it was self-management
for death, no?

373
01:51:31,500 --> 01:51:34,200
We know that now.
But at the time...

374
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:35,600
Even then!

375
01:51:35,900 --> 01:51:36,900
No!

376
01:51:37,200 --> 01:51:39,500
Czerniakow wrote:

377
01:51:39,900 --> 01:51:42,900
"We're puppets,
we have no power".

378
01:51:43,200 --> 01:51:44,100
Yes.

379
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:45,500
No power.

380
01:51:45,700 --> 01:51:47,900
Sure... that was...

381
01:51:48,200 --> 01:51:52,300
You Germans
were the overlords.

382
01:51:52,600 --> 01:51:53,600
Yes.

383
01:51:53,900 --> 01:51:55,600
The overlords. The masters.

384
01:51:55,900 --> 01:51:57,300
Obviously.

385
01:51:57,600 --> 01:52:02,100
Czerniakow was merely a tool.

386
01:52:02,400 --> 01:52:04,500
Yes, but a good tool.

387
01:52:06,300 --> 01:52:11,200
Jewish self-management
worked well, I can tell you.

388
01:52:13,100 --> 01:52:16,600
It worked well for 3 years,

389
01:52:19,300 --> 01:52:22,600
1941, 1942, 1943... 21/2
years... and in the end...

390
01:52:22,900 --> 01:52:24,400
In the end...

391
01:52:24,700 --> 01:52:29,000
"Worked well" for what?
To what end?

392
01:52:30,500 --> 01:52:33,300
For self-preservation.

393
01:52:33,600 --> 01:52:35,200
No! For death!

394
01:52:35,500 --> 01:52:36,500
Yes, but...

395
01:52:36,800 --> 01:52:39,300
Self-management,
self-preservation...

396
01:52:39,600 --> 01:52:42,100
That's easy to say now.

397
01:52:42,400 --> 01:52:47,500
You admitted the conditions
were inhuman.

398
01:52:47,800 --> 01:52:50,000
Atrocious... horrible!

399
01:52:50,200 --> 01:52:51,200
Yes.

400
01:52:51,400 --> 01:52:54,700
So it was clear even then...

401
01:52:56,100 --> 01:52:59,600
No! Extermination
wasn't clear.

402
01:53:00,100 --> 01:53:02,500
Now we see the result.

403
01:53:02,800 --> 01:53:06,800
Extermination isn't so
simple. One step was taken,

404
01:53:07,500 --> 01:53:10,400
then another, and another,
and another...

405
01:53:10,700 --> 01:53:12,000
Yes.

406
01:53:13,100 --> 01:53:17,500
But to understand
the process, one must...

407
01:53:17,800 --> 01:53:22,900
I repeat: Extermination
did not take place in

408
01:53:23,200 --> 01:53:26,800
the ghetto, not at first.
Only with the evacuations.

409
01:53:29,400 --> 01:53:31,000
Evacuations?

410
01:53:31,400 --> 01:53:32,900
The evacuations
to Treblinka.

411
01:53:33,500 --> 01:53:37,200
The ghetto could have been
wiped out with weapons,

412
01:53:38,600 --> 01:53:41,500
as was finally done,
after the rebellion.

413
01:53:42,200 --> 01:53:45,600
After I'd left.
But at the start...

414
01:53:46,300 --> 01:53:49,400
Mr. Lanzmann, this is
getting us nowhere.

415
01:53:50,300 --> 01:53:53,100
We're reaching no
new conclusions.

416
01:53:54,400 --> 01:53:58,400
I don't think we can.

417
01:53:59,700 --> 01:54:03,000
I didn't know
then what I know now.

418
01:54:05,200 --> 01:54:08,500
You weren't a nonentity.

419
01:54:08,900 --> 01:54:10,000
But I was!

420
01:54:10,300 --> 01:54:12,300
You were important.

421
01:54:13,100 --> 01:54:15,500
You overestimate my role.

422
01:54:15,800 --> 01:54:16,800
No.

423
01:54:18,300 --> 01:54:21,000
You were 2nd
to the Commissioner

424
01:54:21,300 --> 01:54:23,100
of the Warsaw
"Jewish district".

425
01:54:23,300 --> 01:54:24,800
But I had no power.

426
01:54:25,100 --> 01:54:26,700
It was something.

427
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:30,900
You were part of the vast
German power structure.

428
01:54:31,200 --> 01:54:33,900
Correct. But a small part.

429
01:54:34,800 --> 01:54:39,200
You overestimate the authority
of a deputy of 28 then.

430
01:54:39,500 --> 01:54:41,300
- You were 30.
- 28.

431
01:54:41,500 --> 01:54:43,400
At 30, you were...

432
01:54:47,700 --> 01:54:50,500
you were mature.

433
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:53,900
Yes, but for a lawyer

434
01:54:54,200 --> 01:54:58,200
who got his degree at 27,
it's just a beginning.

435
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:04,400
You had a doctorate.

436
01:55:04,700 --> 01:55:07,000
The title proves nothing.

437
01:55:07,900 --> 01:55:09,900
Did Auerswald have one too?

438
01:55:10,200 --> 01:55:12,700
No. But the title's
irrelevant.

439
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:14,600
Doctor of Law...

440
01:55:15,700 --> 01:55:18,600
What did you do
after the war?

441
01:55:19,400 --> 01:55:24,100
I was with a mountaineering
publishing house.

442
01:55:24,400 --> 01:55:26,000
That so?

443
01:55:26,300 --> 01:55:30,200
I wrote and published
mountain guide books.

444
01:55:31,400 --> 01:55:33,800
I published a climbers'
magazine.

445
01:55:34,400 --> 01:55:37,600
Is climbing
your main interest?

446
01:55:38,400 --> 01:55:39,700
Yes.

447
01:55:40,600 --> 01:55:42,200
The mountains, the air...

448
01:55:42,500 --> 01:55:43,400
Yes.

449
01:55:43,700 --> 01:55:46,100
The sun, the pure air...

450
01:55:46,400 --> 01:55:48,600
Not like the ghetto air.

451
01:57:41,100 --> 01:57:45,500
N EW YORK.
GERTRU DE SC H N EIDER
and her mother.

452
01:57:46,500 --> 01:57:50,300
LOHAME HAGHETTAOT
KIBBUTZ MUSEUM.

453
01:57:50,400 --> 01:57:54,400
Ghetto fighters' Kibbutz
- ISRAEL.

454
01:57:54,600 --> 01:57:58,600
The Jewish Combat Organization
J.C.O. In the Warsaw ghetto

455
01:57:58,800 --> 01:58:02,800
was officially formed
on July 28, 1942.

456
01:58:03,100 --> 01:58:07,000
After the first mass
deportation to Treblinka,

457
01:58:07,300 --> 01:58:10,300
which was interrupted
on Sept. 30,

458
01:58:10,600 --> 01:58:14,500
some 60,000 Jews
remained in the ghetto.

459
01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:18,800
On January 18, 1943, the
deportations were resumed.

460
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:22,000
Despite a severe lack
of weapons,

461
01:58:22,200 --> 01:58:26,100
the members of the J.C.O.
Called for resistance,

462
01:58:26,500 --> 01:58:30,500
and started fighting, to the
Germans' total surprise.

463
01:58:30,800 --> 01:58:32,700
It lasted 3 days.

464
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:36,000
The Nazis withdrew
with losses,

465
01:58:36,200 --> 01:58:40,200
abandoning weapons
the Jews grabbed.

466
01:58:40,500 --> 01:58:43,400
The deportations
were stopped.

467
01:58:43,700 --> 01:58:45,700
The Germans now knew

468
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:49,900
they had to fight
to conquer the ghetto.

469
01:58:50,200 --> 01:58:54,200
The battle began on the
evening of April 19, 1943,

470
01:58:54,400 --> 01:58:58,400
the eve of Pessach
Passover.

471
01:58:58,700 --> 01:59:02,600
It had to be a fight
to as the death.

472
02:00:01,400 --> 02:00:04,400
SIMHA ROTTEM,
know as "Kajik".

473
02:00:05,300 --> 02:00:08,500
ITZHAK ZUCKERMANN,
know as "Antek",

474
02:00:08,600 --> 02:00:11,500
2nd in command of the J.C.O.

475
02:00:15,500 --> 02:00:18,300
I began drinking
after the war.

476
02:00:26,600 --> 02:00:28,500
It was very difficult.

477
02:00:44,400 --> 02:00:47,300
Claude, you asked
for my impression.

478
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:52,300
If you could lick my heart,

479
02:00:52,600 --> 02:00:54,600
it would poison you.

480
02:00:58,200 --> 02:01:02,200
At the request
of Mordechai Anielewicz,

481
02:01:02,400 --> 02:01:05,400
commander-in-chief
of the J.C.O.,

482
02:01:05,700 --> 02:01:10,000
Antek had left the ghetto 6
days before the German attack.

483
02:01:10,300 --> 02:01:12,300
His mission:

484
02:01:12,600 --> 02:01:16,500
To ask Polish Resistance
leaders to arm the Jews.

485
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:18,800
They refused.

486
02:02:19,200 --> 02:02:24,300
I don't think the human
tongue can describe

487
02:02:24,600 --> 02:02:27,200
the horror we went
through in the ghetto.

488
02:02:28,900 --> 02:02:32,600
In the streets, if you
can call them that,

489
02:02:33,100 --> 02:02:35,800
for nothing was left
of the streets,

490
02:02:36,100 --> 02:02:40,500
we had to step
over heaps of corpses.

491
02:02:41,200 --> 02:02:44,000
There was no room
to pass beside them.

492
02:02:44,200 --> 02:02:47,600
Besides fighting the Germans
we fought hunger

493
02:02:47,900 --> 02:02:49,800
and thirst.

494
02:02:50,100 --> 02:02:52,700
We had no contact
with the outside world,

495
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:56,700
we were completely isolated,
cut off from the world.

496
02:03:12,100 --> 02:03:14,200
We were in such a state

497
02:03:14,500 --> 02:03:17,300
that we could
no longer understand

498
02:03:17,700 --> 02:03:21,200
the very meaning of
why we went on fighting.

499
02:03:28,800 --> 02:03:32,300
We thought of attempting
a break-out

500
02:03:32,500 --> 02:03:35,800
to the Aryan part of
Warsaw, outside the ghetto.

501
02:03:50,600 --> 02:03:52,600
Just before May I,

502
02:03:52,900 --> 02:03:55,000
Sigmund and I were sent

503
02:03:55,400 --> 02:03:59,800
to try to contact
Antek in Aryan Warsaw.

504
02:04:16,700 --> 02:04:20,600
We found a tunnel
under Bonifratrska Street

505
02:04:21,100 --> 02:04:25,100
that led out
into Aryan Warsaw.

506
02:04:56,500 --> 02:04:57,900
Early in the morning,

507
02:04:58,100 --> 02:05:02,200
we suddenly emerged into
a street in broad daylight.

508
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:14,300
Imagine us
on that sunny May 1,

509
02:05:14,600 --> 02:05:19,000
stunned to find ourselves in
the street, among normal people.

510
02:05:19,300 --> 02:05:22,300
We'd come from
another planet.

511
02:05:59,800 --> 02:06:04,200
People immediately
jumped on us

512
02:06:04,500 --> 02:06:07,400
because we certainly
looked exhausted,

513
02:06:07,700 --> 02:06:09,600
skinny, in rags.

514
02:06:10,900 --> 02:06:12,900
Around the ghetto,
there were always

515
02:06:13,200 --> 02:06:17,100
suspicious Poles
who grabbed Jews.

516
02:06:27,300 --> 02:06:30,000
By a miracle,
we escaped them.

517
02:06:44,500 --> 02:06:46,800
In Aryan Warsaw,

518
02:06:47,100 --> 02:06:49,500
life went on as naturally

519
02:06:49,800 --> 02:06:51,900
and normally as before.

520
02:07:09,100 --> 02:07:11,900
The cafÃ©s operated normally,
the restaurants,

521
02:07:12,200 --> 02:07:14,000
buses, streetcars...

522
02:07:14,300 --> 02:07:16,700
The movies were open.

523
02:07:22,300 --> 02:07:26,900
The ghetto was an isolated
island amid normal life.

524
02:07:59,300 --> 02:08:04,200
Our job was to contact
ltzhak Zuckermann

525
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:08,000
to try to mount
a rescue operation,

526
02:08:08,300 --> 02:08:10,200
to try to save

527
02:08:10,600 --> 02:08:13,500
the few fighters who might
still be alive in the ghetto.

528
02:08:17,600 --> 02:08:21,400
We managed
to contact Zuckermann.

529
02:08:29,400 --> 02:08:32,600
We found two sewer workers.

530
02:08:51,500 --> 02:08:53,200
On the night of May 8-9,

531
02:08:53,400 --> 02:08:56,200
we decided to return
to the ghetto

532
02:08:56,500 --> 02:09:00,500
with another buddy,
Riszek, and the 2 sewers.

533
02:09:01,300 --> 02:09:05,100
After the curfew,
we entered the sewers.

534
02:09:18,200 --> 02:09:22,300
We were entirely at the
mercy of the two workmen,

535
02:09:22,600 --> 02:09:26,700
since only they knew the
ghetto's underground layout.

536
02:09:40,800 --> 02:09:44,400
Halfway there,
they decided to turn back,

537
02:09:44,700 --> 02:09:46,500
they tried to drop us,

538
02:09:46,800 --> 02:09:49,400
and we had to threaten
them with our guns.

539
02:09:54,900 --> 02:09:58,800
We went on through
the sewers,

540
02:10:08,300 --> 02:10:11,400
until one of the workmen
told us

541
02:10:11,700 --> 02:10:14,100
we were under the ghetto.

542
02:10:18,400 --> 02:10:22,800
Riszek guarded them
so they couldn't escape.

543
02:10:23,700 --> 02:10:26,800
MILA 18. J.C. O
bunker headquarters

544
02:10:30,500 --> 02:10:33,400
I raised the manhole cover

545
02:10:33,700 --> 02:10:35,700
to go up into the ghetto.

546
02:10:55,700 --> 02:10:59,500
At bunker Mila 18,
I missed them by a day.

547
02:11:14,500 --> 02:11:17,700
I had returned
the night of May 8-9.

548
02:11:20,400 --> 02:11:25,300
The Germans found the bunker
on the morning of the 8th.

549
02:11:25,900 --> 02:11:35,800
WARS AW the monument
to the ghetto fighters

550
02:11:46,300 --> 02:11:50,300
Most of its survivors
committed suicide,

551
02:11:50,700 --> 02:11:53,200
or succumbed to gas
in the bunkers.

552
02:11:54,200 --> 02:11:58,600
The replica of the monument
to the ghetto fighters

553
02:12:47,600 --> 02:12:51,400
I went to bunker
Francziskanska 22.

554
02:12:52,600 --> 02:12:56,200
There was no answer when
I yelled the password,

555
02:12:59,100 --> 02:13:01,800
so I had to go
on through the ghetto.

556
02:13:02,100 --> 02:13:05,800
I suddenly heard a woman
calling from the ruins.

557
02:13:45,600 --> 02:13:49,700
It was darkest night,
no lights, you saw nothing.

558
02:13:49,900 --> 02:13:52,100
All the houses were in ruins

559
02:13:52,400 --> 02:13:54,500
and I heard only one voice.
I thought

560
02:13:54,700 --> 02:13:57,600
some evil spell
had been cast on me,

561
02:13:57,900 --> 02:14:00,900
a woman's voice talking
from the rubble.

562
02:14:01,100 --> 02:14:04,200
I circled the ruins.
I didn't look at my watch,

563
02:14:04,500 --> 02:14:08,300
but I must have spent
a half-hour exploring,

564
02:14:08,600 --> 02:14:11,500
trying to find the woman
whose voice guided me,

565
02:14:11,800 --> 02:14:14,400
but, unfortunately,
I didn't find her.

566
02:14:17,500 --> 02:14:19,500
Were there fires?

567
02:14:40,700 --> 02:14:43,900
Strictly speaking, no, for
the flames had died down,

568
02:14:44,100 --> 02:14:46,200
but there was still smoke,

569
02:14:46,500 --> 02:14:48,900
and that awful smell
of charred flesh

570
02:14:49,200 --> 02:14:52,000
of people who had surely
been burned alive.

571
02:15:27,400 --> 02:15:29,800
I continued on my way,

572
02:15:30,100 --> 02:15:34,300
going to other bunkers
in search of fighting units,

573
02:15:34,700 --> 02:15:36,900
but it was
the same everywhere.

574
02:15:37,200 --> 02:15:40,200
I'd give the password:
"Jan".

575
02:15:42,400 --> 02:15:44,700
That's a Polish first name,
Jan.

576
02:15:49,100 --> 02:15:51,500
Right. And I got no answer.

577
02:15:51,800 --> 02:15:54,900
I went from bunker
to bunker

578
02:15:55,200 --> 02:15:59,200
and after walking
for hours in the ghetto,

579
02:15:59,500 --> 02:16:02,300
I went back
toward the sewers.

580
02:16:02,600 --> 02:16:04,400
Was he alone then?

581
02:16:08,400 --> 02:16:10,500
Yes, I was alone
all the time.

582
02:17:03,900 --> 02:17:06,800
Except for
that woman's voice,

583
02:17:07,100 --> 02:17:10,400
and a man I met as
I came out of the sewers,

584
02:17:10,700 --> 02:17:13,600
I was alone throughout
my tour of the ghetto.

585
02:17:13,900 --> 02:17:16,700
I didn't meet a living soul.

586
02:17:17,200 --> 02:17:19,400
At one point, I recall

587
02:17:19,700 --> 02:17:23,700
feeling a kind of peace,
of serenity,

588
02:17:24,100 --> 02:17:26,900
when I said to myself,
"I'm the last Jew.

589
02:17:27,200 --> 02:17:30,800
"I'll wait for morning
and for the Germans."
