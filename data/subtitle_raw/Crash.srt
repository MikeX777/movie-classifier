1
00:05:25,238 --> 00:05:27,433
We're just about ready
to go here.

2
00:05:27,474 --> 00:05:28,532
Good.

3
00:05:28,575 --> 00:05:31,544
I'm looking for James.
Has anybody seen James Ballard?

4
00:05:31,578 --> 00:05:34,877
Do you know who I mean?
The producer of this epic?

5
00:05:34,914 --> 00:05:36,779
I think I saw him
in the camera room.

6
00:05:42,589 --> 00:05:44,216
James, are you in there?

7
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,253
Can we get your stamp of
approval on our steadicam shot?

8
00:05:54,634 --> 00:05:55,658
Of course.

9
00:05:59,973 --> 00:06:01,907
Be there in a minute.

10
00:06:12,385 --> 00:06:14,080
Where were you?

11
00:06:16,723 --> 00:06:18,918
In a private aircraft hangar.

12
00:06:21,561 --> 00:06:23,961
Anyone could've walked in.

13
00:06:25,432 --> 00:06:27,263
Did you come?

14
00:06:28,935 --> 00:06:29,924
No.

15
00:06:34,774 --> 00:06:38,938
What about your camera girl?
Did she come?

16
00:06:54,294 --> 00:06:56,285
We were interrupted.

17
00:07:01,901 --> 00:07:04,392
I had to go back to the set.

18
00:07:07,073 --> 00:07:08,665
Poor darling.

19
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,809
Maybe the next one.

20
00:07:18,752 --> 00:07:20,481
Maybe the next one.

21
00:07:58,291 --> 00:07:59,451
Shit.

22
00:09:34,754 --> 00:09:36,745
Not a lot of action here.

23
00:09:38,758 --> 00:09:42,091
Have you considered this
would be the airport hospital?

24
00:09:44,264 --> 00:09:46,926
This ward is reserved
for air crash victims.

25
00:09:49,435 --> 00:09:51,300
The beds are kept waiting.

26
00:09:52,205 --> 00:09:54,696
Well, if I ground it during
my flying lesson Saturday...

27
00:09:54,741 --> 00:09:57,266
you might wake up
and find me next to you.

28
00:09:59,312 --> 00:10:01,610
You're getting out of bed soon.

29
00:10:03,149 --> 00:10:04,980
They want you to walk.

30
00:10:12,492 --> 00:10:14,323
The other man, the dead man?

31
00:10:15,328 --> 00:10:16,818
His wife's a doctor.

32
00:10:18,164 --> 00:10:20,291
Dr. Helen Remington.

33
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:23,894
She's here somewhere...
as a patient, of course.

34
00:10:25,571 --> 00:10:27,596
Maybe you'll find her
in the hallways...

35
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,335
during one of your walks.

36
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:32,875
And her husband, what was he?

37
00:10:35,848 --> 00:10:38,544
A chemical engineer
for a food company.

38
00:10:42,255 --> 00:10:44,519
Where's... where's the car?

39
00:10:46,092 --> 00:10:48,583
Outside, in the visitors
car park.

40
00:10:48,628 --> 00:10:49,856
What?

41
00:10:52,265 --> 00:10:53,994
They brought the car here?

42
00:10:54,033 --> 00:10:56,661
My car. Not yours.

43
00:11:00,073 --> 00:11:02,337
Yours is a complete wreck.

44
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:05,276
Police had to drag it
to the pound.

45
00:11:05,311 --> 00:11:07,643
It's behind the station.

46
00:11:09,515 --> 00:11:11,415
After being bombarded
endlessly...

47
00:11:11,451 --> 00:11:13,578
by road safety propaganda,
it's...

48
00:11:15,855 --> 00:11:17,584
almost a relief to have...

49
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:21,355
found myself
in an actual accident.

50
00:11:54,427 --> 00:11:56,418
Dr. Remington?

51
00:12:17,817 --> 00:12:18,806
James Ballard?

52
00:12:19,952 --> 00:12:21,442
Yes.

53
00:12:42,975 --> 00:12:43,999
Crash victim?

54
00:12:44,043 --> 00:12:46,341
Yes. I'd...

55
00:13:12,071 --> 00:13:14,062
We'll deal with these later.

56
00:13:36,762 --> 00:13:39,560
Both of the front wheels
of their car and the engine...

57
00:13:39,599 --> 00:13:42,466
were driven back
into the driver's section,

58
00:13:42,502 --> 00:13:44,629
pulling the floor.

59
00:13:47,473 --> 00:13:48,906
Blood still marked the hood...

60
00:13:48,941 --> 00:13:51,501
like little streamers
of black lace...

61
00:13:51,544 --> 00:13:54,274
running towards
the windshield wiper gutters.

62
00:13:55,414 --> 00:13:57,814
Bloody flecks were spattered...

63
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:00,375
across the seat
and steering wheel.

64
00:14:04,023 --> 00:14:09,290
And the instrument panel
was buckled inwards...

65
00:14:09,328 --> 00:14:12,195
cracking the clock
and speedometer dials.

66
00:14:15,468 --> 00:14:18,164
The cabin was deformed.

67
00:14:19,172 --> 00:14:22,972
And there was dust and glass...

68
00:14:23,009 --> 00:14:25,876
and plastic flakes
everywhere inside.

69
00:14:28,014 --> 00:14:30,710
The carpeting was damp.

70
00:14:32,018 --> 00:14:35,977
It stank of blood and other body
and machine fluids.

71
00:15:01,781 --> 00:15:04,147
You should've gone
to the funeral.

72
00:15:05,284 --> 00:15:06,546
I wish I had.

73
00:15:08,754 --> 00:15:11,086
They bury the dead so quickly.

74
00:15:12,925 --> 00:15:15,655
They should leave them
lying around for months.

75
00:15:18,431 --> 00:15:20,228
What about his wife?
The woman doctor?

76
00:15:20,266 --> 00:15:22,200
Have you been to visit her yet?

77
00:15:23,936 --> 00:15:24,994
No.

78
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,668
I couldn't.

79
00:15:32,945 --> 00:15:34,936
I feel too close to her.

80
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:11,211
I don't like the idea of
your getting into a car so soon.

81
00:16:12,151 --> 00:16:13,675
I can't sit
on this balcony forever.

82
00:16:13,719 --> 00:16:16,017
I feel like a potted plant.

83
00:16:18,257 --> 00:16:20,248
How can you drive, James?

84
00:16:22,261 --> 00:16:24,161
You can barely walk.

85
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:28,790
Is traffic heavier now?

86
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,665
There seem to be
three times as many cars...

87
00:16:33,706 --> 00:16:35,936
as there were
before the accident.

88
00:16:37,643 --> 00:16:40,168
I have to leave for work.

89
00:19:19,271 --> 00:19:20,898
After this sort of thing...

90
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,067
how do people manage
to look at a car...

91
00:19:23,108 --> 00:19:24,598
let alone drive one?

92
00:19:33,285 --> 00:19:35,617
I'm trying to find Charles' car.

93
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:40,315
It's not here.

94
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:42,793
Maybe the police
are still holding it.

95
00:19:42,828 --> 00:19:45,797
They said it was here.
They told me this morning.

96
00:19:56,976 --> 00:19:58,944
This is your car?

97
00:20:15,828 --> 00:20:17,796
You might tear your glove.

98
00:20:24,537 --> 00:20:27,631
I never should've come here.

99
00:20:27,673 --> 00:20:30,198
I'm surprised the police
don't make it more difficult.

100
00:20:31,377 --> 00:20:32,844
Were you badly hurt?

101
00:20:32,878 --> 00:20:35,346
I think we saw each other
at the hospital.

102
00:20:35,381 --> 00:20:37,406
I don't want the car.

103
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:39,550
In fact,
I was appalled to find...

104
00:20:39,585 --> 00:20:42,645
that I have to pay
to have it scrapped.

105
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:46,721
Can I give you a lift?

106
00:20:48,561 --> 00:20:51,155
I somehow find myself
driving again.

107
00:20:59,905 --> 00:21:02,465
You haven't told me
where we're going.

108
00:21:02,508 --> 00:21:03,736
I haven't?

109
00:21:05,344 --> 00:21:07,175
To the airport,
if you don't mind.

110
00:21:07,212 --> 00:21:08,509
The airport?

111
00:21:08,547 --> 00:21:10,310
Why? Are you leaving?

112
00:21:10,349 --> 00:21:11,680
Not yet.

113
00:21:12,685 --> 00:21:14,846
Though not soon enough
for some people.

114
00:21:15,354 --> 00:21:19,688
A death in the doctor's family
makes the patients uneasy.

115
00:21:19,725 --> 00:21:22,091
I take it you're not wearing
white to reassure them.

116
00:21:22,127 --> 00:21:25,187
I'll wear a fucking kimono
if I want to.

117
00:21:34,807 --> 00:21:36,798
So why the airport?

118
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:39,803
I work in
the Immigration Department.

119
00:21:42,314 --> 00:21:43,872
Do you want a cigarette?

120
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:45,076
No.

121
00:21:46,652 --> 00:21:49,120
I started to smoke
at the hospital.

122
00:21:50,623 --> 00:21:52,853
It's kind of stupid.

123
00:22:02,801 --> 00:22:05,463
Look at all this traffic.

124
00:22:09,241 --> 00:22:10,503
I'm not sure I can deal with it.

125
00:22:10,542 --> 00:22:12,942
It's much worse now.
Have you noticed that?

126
00:22:12,978 --> 00:22:14,036
Yes.

127
00:22:22,187 --> 00:22:24,178
The day I left the hospital...

128
00:22:25,858 --> 00:22:29,453
I had the extraordinary
feeling that all these cars...

129
00:22:29,495 --> 00:22:31,986
were gathering
for some special reason...

130
00:22:32,031 --> 00:22:33,464
I didn't understand.

131
00:22:35,367 --> 00:22:39,428
There seemed to be
ten times as much traffic.

132
00:22:45,277 --> 00:22:46,676
Are we imagining it?

133
00:22:53,118 --> 00:22:56,110
You've bought yourself
exactly the same car again.

134
00:22:57,723 --> 00:23:00,248
It's the same shape and color.

135
00:23:25,084 --> 00:23:27,245
We're close
to the airport garage.

136
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,252
It won't be busy
this time of day.

137
00:26:21,159 --> 00:26:23,286
These were
the confident last words...

138
00:26:23,328 --> 00:26:26,991
of the brilliant, young
Hollywood star James Dean...

139
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:32,459
as he piloted his Porsche
550 Spyder race car...

140
00:26:32,504 --> 00:26:35,632
toward a date with death...

141
00:26:35,674 --> 00:26:37,801
along a lonely stretch...

142
00:26:37,843 --> 00:26:40,641
of California
two-lane blacktop...

143
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:42,874
Route 466.

144
00:26:46,718 --> 00:26:50,210
"Don't worry.
That guy's gotta see us. "

145
00:26:57,195 --> 00:27:00,289
The year... 1955.

146
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,530
The day... September 30.

147
00:27:06,471 --> 00:27:07,631
The time...

148
00:27:09,474 --> 00:27:11,271
Now.

149
00:27:15,213 --> 00:27:19,343
The first star of our show
is "Little Bastard. "

150
00:27:20,452 --> 00:27:22,647
James Dean's racing Porsche.

151
00:27:23,722 --> 00:27:25,383
He named it after himself...

152
00:27:25,424 --> 00:27:29,326
and had his racing number...
130... painted on it.

153
00:27:31,596 --> 00:27:33,621
Who is that, the announcer?
Do I know him?

154
00:27:33,665 --> 00:27:35,132
Here behind the seats was...

155
00:27:35,167 --> 00:27:39,467
a very sophisticated air-cooled
four-cylinder racing engine.

156
00:27:39,504 --> 00:27:43,235
That's Vaughan.
He spoke to you at the hospital.

157
00:27:46,878 --> 00:27:48,573
I thought he was
a medical photographer...

158
00:27:51,817 --> 00:27:53,375
doing some sort of
accident research.

159
00:27:53,418 --> 00:27:56,387
He wanted every conceivable
detail about our crash.

160
00:27:56,421 --> 00:27:59,879
Body... light,
no more than 1,350 pounds.

161
00:27:59,925 --> 00:28:03,156
It was nimble.
It was responsive.

162
00:28:03,195 --> 00:28:05,527
When I first met Vaughan,
he was a specialist...

163
00:28:05,564 --> 00:28:07,657
in international
computerized traffic systems.

164
00:28:07,699 --> 00:28:09,667
The racers of the day...

165
00:28:09,701 --> 00:28:12,670
said that it was not
an easy car to drive fast.

166
00:28:12,704 --> 00:28:14,672
I don't know what he is now.

167
00:28:14,706 --> 00:28:17,675
Which brings us
to the second star...

168
00:28:17,709 --> 00:28:21,839
a stunt man, former
race driver Colin Seagrave.

169
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,370
Colin Seagrave.

170
00:28:24,783 --> 00:28:27,877
He will drive our replica
of James Dean's car.

171
00:28:32,557 --> 00:28:34,752
How you doing?
Sure you're up for this?

172
00:28:35,794 --> 00:28:38,194
You bet.

173
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:41,859
I myself shall play the role
of Dean's racing mechanic...

174
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:45,358
Rolf Voudrich, sent over
from the Porsche factory...

175
00:28:45,404 --> 00:28:47,031
in Zuffenhausen, Germany.

176
00:28:47,072 --> 00:28:49,870
Now, this mechanic
was himself fated to die...

177
00:28:49,908 --> 00:28:53,241
in a car crash in Germany
26 years later.

178
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,173
The third,
and in some ways...

179
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:01,410
most important player...

180
00:29:01,453 --> 00:29:05,253
the college student,
Donald Turnipseed...

181
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:08,726
played by movie stunt man
Brett Trask.

182
00:29:11,129 --> 00:29:13,063
Brett Trask.

183
00:29:18,637 --> 00:29:23,506
Turnipseed was on his way home
to Fresno for the weekend.

184
00:29:23,542 --> 00:29:27,342
James Dean was on his way to
an automobile race in Salinas.

185
00:29:28,647 --> 00:29:31,810
Salinas was just a dusty town
in Northern California.

186
00:29:33,151 --> 00:29:37,281
The two would meet
for one moment.

187
00:29:37,322 --> 00:29:40,849
But it was a moment that...

188
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:44,488
that would create
a Hollywood legend.

189
00:29:46,631 --> 00:29:48,861
You'll notice that
we're not wearing helmets...

190
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,095
or safety padding of any kind.

191
00:29:51,136 --> 00:29:54,594
Our cars are not equipped
with roll cages or seat belts.

192
00:29:54,639 --> 00:29:59,599
We rely solely on the skill
of our drivers for our safety...

193
00:29:59,644 --> 00:30:03,671
so that we can bring you
the ultimate in authenticity.

194
00:30:06,184 --> 00:30:07,173
All right.

195
00:30:08,353 --> 00:30:12,119
Here we go...
the fatal crash of James Dean.

196
00:30:20,732 --> 00:30:22,029
OK, let's wind her up.

197
00:30:39,751 --> 00:30:40,740
Go.

198
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:41,242
Is this part of the act,
or are they really hurt?

199
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:42,746
I don't know.

200
00:31:42,781 --> 00:31:45,272
You can never
be sure with Vaughan.

201
00:31:46,785 --> 00:31:48,275
This is his show.

202
00:31:52,123 --> 00:31:54,921
Rolf Voudrich...

203
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,793
was thrown from the Porsche...

204
00:31:58,964 --> 00:32:00,522
and spent a year...

205
00:32:02,234 --> 00:32:03,724
in the hospital...

206
00:32:07,405 --> 00:32:10,238
recovering from his injuries.

207
00:32:19,251 --> 00:32:23,210
Donald Turnipseed
was found wandering around...

208
00:32:23,255 --> 00:32:25,416
in a daze but basically unhurt.

209
00:32:26,925 --> 00:32:29,894
James Dean
died of a broken neck...

210
00:32:29,928 --> 00:32:31,919
and became immortal.

211
00:32:39,337 --> 00:32:40,827
What's the matter?

212
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:45,840
Hold me up. I'm dizzy.
I can't stand.

213
00:32:45,877 --> 00:32:48,345
I know that man... Seagrave.

214
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:50,371
I think he's genuinely hurt.

215
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:00,285
Disperse at once.

216
00:33:07,832 --> 00:33:09,493
You're all liable for fines
or arrest.

217
00:33:11,503 --> 00:33:14,734
Disperse at once.

218
00:33:19,778 --> 00:33:21,746
- How you doin'?
- I'm all right.

219
00:33:23,248 --> 00:33:24,579
What's the matter with Seagrave?

220
00:33:24,616 --> 00:33:28,848
He hit his head, I think.
His balance is off.

221
00:33:32,023 --> 00:33:34,821
Why are the police
taking this so seriously?

222
00:33:34,859 --> 00:33:36,793
No, it's not the police.

223
00:33:36,828 --> 00:33:39,820
It's the Department
of Transport.

224
00:33:39,864 --> 00:33:41,331
It's a big joke.

225
00:33:41,366 --> 00:33:44,358
They have no idea
who we really are.

226
00:33:59,317 --> 00:34:00,682
Was I glib?

227
00:34:02,153 --> 00:34:05,645
"James Dean died of a broken
neck and became immortal. "

228
00:34:11,496 --> 00:34:12,986
I couldn't resist.

229
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,106
Oh, God.

230
00:34:56,141 --> 00:34:58,166
What happened?

231
00:34:58,209 --> 00:35:01,372
Come here. Lie down.

232
00:35:01,413 --> 00:35:03,938
They did the James Dean crash.

233
00:35:03,982 --> 00:35:06,314
It seemed to go perfectly,
but then...

234
00:35:06,351 --> 00:35:08,819
he started to feel nauseous
on the way back.

235
00:35:08,853 --> 00:35:11,185
I'm sure it's a concussion.

236
00:35:11,222 --> 00:35:14,680
Well, we're familiar enough
with that then, aren't we?

237
00:36:00,772 --> 00:36:02,364
Seagrave.

238
00:36:07,745 --> 00:36:09,736
Seagrave,
I really would like to...

239
00:36:11,082 --> 00:36:13,277
work out the details...

240
00:36:14,052 --> 00:36:17,749
of the Jayne Mansfield
crash with you.

241
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:27,129
We could...

242
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:32,592
We could do the...
the decapitation.

243
00:36:34,372 --> 00:36:37,364
The head embedded
in the windshield.

244
00:36:37,408 --> 00:36:40,809
The world record is
a whopping forty-two pounds.

245
00:36:40,845 --> 00:36:43,336
And the dead dog thing,
you know?

246
00:36:48,052 --> 00:36:50,520
You know, the Chihuahua
in the back seat?

247
00:36:50,555 --> 00:36:52,546
I got it all worked out.

248
00:36:58,062 --> 00:37:00,053
I'll be ready, Vaughan.

249
00:37:00,098 --> 00:37:02,692
I want really big tits.

250
00:37:04,702 --> 00:37:06,192
Out to here.

251
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:10,906
So the audience can see 'em
get all cut up...

252
00:37:10,942 --> 00:37:13,274
and crushed on the dashboard.

253
00:37:17,882 --> 00:37:20,043
Yeah, we'll do that.

254
00:37:20,084 --> 00:37:22,109
Ballard...

255
00:37:22,153 --> 00:37:24,178
I need your help.

256
00:37:49,514 --> 00:37:51,311
Do you live here with Seagrave?

257
00:37:51,349 --> 00:37:54,147
No. I live in my car.
This is my workshop.

258
00:38:14,305 --> 00:38:16,296
This is my new project.

259
00:38:38,329 --> 00:38:40,058
You recognize her?

260
00:38:41,833 --> 00:38:43,130
That's Gabrielle.

261
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:47,328
That's her right outside
the door there.

262
00:39:36,154 --> 00:39:38,622
I thought you might be
missing these.

263
00:39:44,629 --> 00:39:45,618
Right.

264
00:39:50,201 --> 00:39:52,567
So here you are
at the nerve center.

265
00:39:57,341 --> 00:40:00,538
Vaughan makes everything
look like a crime, doesn't he?

266
00:40:20,865 --> 00:40:23,060
What exactly
is your project, Vaughan?

267
00:40:25,269 --> 00:40:27,203
Book of car crashes?

268
00:40:31,209 --> 00:40:32,540
Medical study?

269
00:40:34,045 --> 00:40:35,842
Sensational documentary?

270
00:40:39,383 --> 00:40:41,374
Global traffic?

271
00:40:42,553 --> 00:40:45,147
It's something...

272
00:40:45,189 --> 00:40:49,523
we are all intimately
involved in.

273
00:40:52,163 --> 00:40:56,293
The reshaping of the human body
by modern technology.

274
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:03,598
Nothing.

275
00:41:03,641 --> 00:41:05,768
It's a Sunday, man.

276
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:07,402
She's desperate.

277
00:41:07,445 --> 00:41:09,208
No, I'm not.

278
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:14,380
The length?

279
00:41:14,418 --> 00:41:16,818
'Cause I'm not gonna
hold the sets that long.

280
00:44:17,868 --> 00:44:22,271
He must have fucked a lot of
women in that huge car of his.

281
00:44:23,274 --> 00:44:25,765
It's like a bed on wheels.

282
00:44:27,345 --> 00:44:29,506
It must smell of semen.

283
00:44:32,717 --> 00:44:34,514
It does.

284
00:44:39,123 --> 00:44:41,284
Do you find him attractive?

285
00:44:42,126 --> 00:44:44,424
He's very pale.

286
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:48,862
Covered with scars.

287
00:44:48,899 --> 00:44:50,958
Would you like
to fuck him, though...

288
00:44:51,002 --> 00:44:53,266
in that car?

289
00:44:55,172 --> 00:44:58,300
No.

290
00:44:58,342 --> 00:45:00,105
But...

291
00:45:00,144 --> 00:45:02,806
But when he's in that car...

292
00:45:06,183 --> 00:45:08,549
Have you seen his penis?

293
00:45:12,823 --> 00:45:15,587
I think it's badly scarred...

294
00:45:18,996 --> 00:45:20,793
from a motorcycle accident.

295
00:45:25,436 --> 00:45:27,529
Is he circumcised?

296
00:45:29,106 --> 00:45:31,973
Can you imagine
what his anus looks like?

297
00:45:32,009 --> 00:45:34,102
Describe it to me.

298
00:45:39,483 --> 00:45:41,849
Would you like to sodomize him?

299
00:45:44,922 --> 00:45:48,688
Would you like to put your penis
right into his anus?

300
00:45:48,726 --> 00:45:50,956
Just thrust it up his anus?

301
00:45:50,995 --> 00:45:52,860
Tell me.

302
00:45:52,897 --> 00:45:55,491
Describe it to me.

303
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,968
Tell me what you would do.

304
00:45:59,003 --> 00:46:03,440
Could you just kiss him
in that car?

305
00:46:05,142 --> 00:46:08,976
Describe how you reach over.

306
00:46:09,013 --> 00:46:11,607
Unzip his greasy jeans.

307
00:46:12,149 --> 00:46:14,276
Take out his penis.

308
00:46:17,388 --> 00:46:21,188
Would you kiss it
or suck it right away?

309
00:46:22,059 --> 00:46:23,390
Which hand would you...

310
00:46:24,228 --> 00:46:27,095
Which hand
would you hold it in?

311
00:46:31,168 --> 00:46:33,830
Have you ever sucked a penis?

312
00:46:36,173 --> 00:46:39,574
Do you know
what semen tastes like?

313
00:46:39,610 --> 00:46:43,341
Have you ever tasted semen?

314
00:46:44,348 --> 00:46:48,444
Some semen
is saltier than others.

315
00:46:58,696 --> 00:47:03,497
Vaughan's semen
must be very salty.

316
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:44,103
Have you come?

317
00:47:47,011 --> 00:47:48,535
I'm all right.

318
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,490
Finish your story.

319
00:48:14,505 --> 00:48:19,067
The junior pathologist
at Ashford Hospital...

320
00:48:19,977 --> 00:48:23,276
then the husband
of a colleague of mine.

321
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,715
A trainee radiologist...

322
00:48:32,489 --> 00:48:36,687
then the service manager
at my garage.

323
00:48:39,029 --> 00:48:40,997
You had sex
with all those men in cars?

324
00:48:42,533 --> 00:48:43,727
Only in cars?

325
00:48:45,035 --> 00:48:48,198
Yes. I didn't plan it that way.

326
00:48:52,376 --> 00:48:55,345
Did you fantasize that Vaughan
was photographing...

327
00:48:55,379 --> 00:48:59,509
all these sex acts as though
they were traffic accidents?

328
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:01,074
Yes.

329
00:49:04,488 --> 00:49:06,683
They felt
like traffic accidents.

330
00:50:00,844 --> 00:50:02,402
Now...

331
00:50:04,982 --> 00:50:08,850
We must accumulate
all the paper we can about her.

332
00:50:08,886 --> 00:50:12,287
Some of the stuff that Helen
brought back is terrific...

333
00:50:12,323 --> 00:50:15,315
tolerances of the human face
in crash impacts...

334
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:16,519
mechanisms of...

335
00:50:19,496 --> 00:50:24,456
Now, where is the...

336
00:50:24,501 --> 00:50:28,699
I'm sure we see this again
in slow motion.

337
00:50:29,673 --> 00:50:30,833
Closer, I mean...

338
00:50:30,874 --> 00:50:33,536
in detail.

339
00:50:33,577 --> 00:50:36,842
We can watch another tape.
We brought lots of tapes.

340
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:40,509
No. L... I know this tape.
I know this tape.

341
00:50:40,551 --> 00:50:43,577
That tape player's fucked.
That's what it is.

342
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:47,616
It always does that.

343
00:51:11,048 --> 00:51:12,913
You're upset.

344
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:15,919
No. I'm all right.

345
00:51:17,855 --> 00:51:20,289
I'm all right now.

346
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:41,503
I've always wanted
to drive a crash car.

347
00:51:44,348 --> 00:51:47,317
You could get your wish
at any moment.

348
00:51:47,351 --> 00:51:50,320
No. I mean a crash car
with a history.

349
00:51:50,354 --> 00:51:52,652
Camus' Fassellvega...

350
00:51:52,689 --> 00:51:55,817
Nathaniel West's
station wagon...

351
00:51:55,859 --> 00:51:59,158
Grace Kelly's Rover 3500.

352
00:51:59,196 --> 00:52:02,256
Just fix it enough
to get it rolling.

353
00:52:02,299 --> 00:52:05,791
Don't clean it.
Don't touch anything else.

354
00:52:11,308 --> 00:52:14,300
Is that why you drive this car?

355
00:52:16,313 --> 00:52:18,281
Do you see Kennedy's
assassination...

356
00:52:18,315 --> 00:52:21,284
as a special kind of car crash?

357
00:52:21,318 --> 00:52:23,377
A case could be made.

358
00:52:24,388 --> 00:52:26,413
Whoa! Watch this!
You're gonna hit him.

359
00:52:27,825 --> 00:52:30,487
Oh, God.

360
00:52:34,832 --> 00:52:38,063
Here. Take a look at this.

361
00:52:38,101 --> 00:52:40,092
Tell me what you think of these.

362
00:52:45,609 --> 00:52:49,636
You recognize this one.
This is James Dean.

363
00:52:53,851 --> 00:52:56,979
This is the next one
Seagrave and I are gonna do...

364
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:58,248
Jayne Mansfield.

365
00:53:03,627 --> 00:53:06,095
It's all very satisfying.

366
00:53:06,129 --> 00:53:09,098
I'm not sure I understand why.

367
00:53:10,868 --> 00:53:13,666
That's the future, Ballard...

368
00:53:14,338 --> 00:53:16,272
and you're already a part of it.

369
00:53:17,341 --> 00:53:20,833
You're beginning to see
that for the first time...

370
00:53:20,878 --> 00:53:24,507
there's a benevolent
psychopathology...

371
00:53:24,548 --> 00:53:26,140
that beckons towards us.

372
00:53:27,384 --> 00:53:31,377
For example, the car crash
is a fertilizing...

373
00:53:31,421 --> 00:53:33,480
rather than a destructive event.

374
00:53:34,892 --> 00:53:38,919
A liberation of sexual energy...

375
00:53:38,962 --> 00:53:41,362
mediating the sexuality
of those who have died...

376
00:53:41,398 --> 00:53:45,357
with an intensity that's
impossible in any other form.

377
00:53:45,402 --> 00:53:48,860
Now, to experience that...

378
00:53:48,906 --> 00:53:51,568
to live that, that is...

379
00:53:53,243 --> 00:53:55,302
That's my project.

380
00:53:55,345 --> 00:53:59,873
What about reshaping the human
body by modern technology?

381
00:53:59,917 --> 00:54:02,613
I thought that was your project.

382
00:54:02,653 --> 00:54:05,816
That's just
a crude sci-fi concept.

383
00:54:05,856 --> 00:54:08,188
It just kind of
floats on the surface...

384
00:54:08,225 --> 00:54:09,590
and doesn't threaten anybody.

385
00:54:11,528 --> 00:54:12,859
I use it to test
the resilience...

386
00:54:12,896 --> 00:54:15,456
of my potential partners
in psychopathology.

387
00:54:40,424 --> 00:54:43,222
- What's going on, baby?
- What's going on with you?

388
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:45,387
- Want to go for a ride?
- You and your friend?

389
00:54:46,430 --> 00:54:48,660
- Just me and my friend here.
- That's cool.

390
00:54:48,699 --> 00:54:50,894
- Don't go away.
- What you got under there?

391
00:54:50,934 --> 00:54:53,402
- I'm clean.
- You got a place?

392
00:54:53,437 --> 00:54:56,838
- The back seat of my car.
- In your car?

393
00:54:56,873 --> 00:55:01,367
- He'll drive.
- We'll go driving around?

394
00:55:01,411 --> 00:55:03,379
- Absolutely. $60.
- $60?

395
00:55:03,413 --> 00:55:05,881
You'll get a nice scenic ride.

396
00:55:05,916 --> 00:55:07,315
One fifty for the two.

397
00:55:07,351 --> 00:55:09,319
- No. It's just me.
- Just you?

398
00:55:09,353 --> 00:55:11,947
If he does get involved,
I'll give you 150.

399
00:55:11,989 --> 00:55:13,820
- Maybe.
- What do you mean?

400
00:55:13,857 --> 00:55:16,587
I'm saying, is he all right?

401
00:55:19,429 --> 00:55:21,397
Come here, sweetie.

402
00:55:21,431 --> 00:55:22,898
You open your mouth.

403
00:55:22,933 --> 00:55:26,061
- Yes, Daddy.
- There you go.

404
00:55:26,103 --> 00:55:29,095
I don't want you blowing
it up my urethra.

405
00:55:31,441 --> 00:55:33,238
James, you drive.

406
00:57:37,267 --> 00:57:39,235
James, we're leaving now.

407
00:57:39,269 --> 00:57:40,793
Do you want a lift?

408
00:57:42,038 --> 00:57:43,403
No, thank you.

409
00:57:44,708 --> 00:57:47,768
Catherine's
coming to pick me up.

410
00:57:58,755 --> 00:57:59,983
What's going on?

411
00:58:00,957 --> 00:58:04,984
They're questioning him about
an accident at the airport.

412
00:58:05,028 --> 00:58:07,155
A pedestrian was killed.

413
00:58:08,899 --> 00:58:11,959
They think he was
run over intentionally.

414
00:58:12,002 --> 00:58:14,493
Vaughan isn't interested
in pedestrians.

415
00:58:17,908 --> 00:58:20,001
Don't you think
he looks a bit shaky?

416
00:58:24,014 --> 00:58:27,381
- Maybe I should drive him.
- Where's your car?

417
00:58:27,417 --> 00:58:29,681
At home.
Couldn't face the traffic.

418
00:58:44,034 --> 00:58:46,366
Why don't I drive?

419
00:59:22,639 --> 00:59:24,368
You coming?

420
00:59:29,446 --> 00:59:33,815
- Third westbound at Jameson.
- 793, Control. I'm 10-17.

421
00:59:33,850 --> 00:59:35,784
Please advise the ambulance
that three lanes are...

422
00:59:47,998 --> 00:59:49,488
Let's record this.

423
00:59:59,876 --> 01:00:02,470
This is a work of art.

424
01:00:02,512 --> 01:00:04,742
Absolutely a work of art.

425
01:00:14,190 --> 01:00:15,157
Slow down.

426
01:00:15,191 --> 01:00:16,283
Slow down. Not so fast.

427
01:00:26,036 --> 01:00:28,129
Slow down. Stop.

428
01:03:57,547 --> 01:03:59,515
You couldn't wait for me?

429
01:03:59,549 --> 01:04:02,950
You did the Jayne Mansfield
crash without me?

430
01:04:02,986 --> 01:04:04,920
Oh, the dog.

431
01:04:04,954 --> 01:04:07,252
The dog is brilliant.

432
01:04:21,771 --> 01:04:24,740
I must have driven
through something.

433
01:04:26,409 --> 01:04:29,970
There's some blood on the car
here on the handle...

434
01:04:30,013 --> 01:04:35,747
and on the wheel,
and also the wheel well.

435
01:04:35,785 --> 01:04:37,446
See?

436
01:04:38,955 --> 01:04:41,924
If the police stop you again,
they may impound the car.

437
01:04:41,958 --> 01:04:44,950
You're right, Ballard.

438
01:04:46,462 --> 01:04:50,922
There's an all-night car wash
by the airport service area.

439
01:04:52,569 --> 01:04:53,558
Watch yourself.

440
01:13:08,397 --> 01:13:10,194
Is there something here
that interests you?

441
01:13:14,470 --> 01:13:15,960
This interests me.

442
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:20,665
I'd like to see
if I can fit into a car...

443
01:13:20,710 --> 01:13:23,235
designed for a normal body.

444
01:13:23,279 --> 01:13:25,577
Could you help me
into it, please?

445
01:13:28,350 --> 01:13:29,510
Yeah, sure.

446
01:13:37,026 --> 01:13:38,926
Are these safe cars?

447
01:13:38,961 --> 01:13:41,555
Yes, of course.
They're very safe.

448
01:14:08,958 --> 01:14:10,289
I'm caught.

449
01:14:44,894 --> 01:14:47,089
Oh, shit.

450
01:14:49,732 --> 01:14:53,168
Fuck. This is bad.
This is really bad.

451
01:17:25,521 --> 01:17:27,819
James, somebody named Vaughan.
You want it?

452
01:17:32,795 --> 01:17:34,194
Hello. Ballard.

453
01:17:34,229 --> 01:17:36,129
I need to see you, Ballard.

454
01:17:36,165 --> 01:17:39,066
I need to talk to you
about the project.

455
01:17:42,438 --> 01:17:44,269
Where are you?

456
01:17:59,021 --> 01:18:00,921
I think you're making it
too clean.

457
01:18:00,956 --> 01:18:03,550
Medical tattoos
are supposed to be clean.

458
01:18:03,592 --> 01:18:05,025
But this is not
a medical tattoo.

459
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:07,153
This is a prophetic tattoo.

460
01:18:07,196 --> 01:18:10,359
And prophecy's ragged
and dirty...

461
01:18:12,668 --> 01:18:16,160
so make it ragged and dirty.

462
01:18:16,205 --> 01:18:17,968
Prophetic?

463
01:18:18,007 --> 01:18:21,204
Is this personal prophecy
or global prophecy?

464
01:18:22,578 --> 01:18:24,170
There's no difference.

465
01:18:26,648 --> 01:18:28,616
Let me see here. Where is it?

466
01:18:30,285 --> 01:18:36,781
James, I want you to let
her give you this one.

467
01:18:45,534 --> 01:18:47,468
Where do you think
that one should go?

468
01:24:11,793 --> 01:24:13,693
I thought that was you up there.

469
01:24:18,266 --> 01:24:20,257
My last lesson's next week.

470
01:24:37,152 --> 01:24:39,620
James, my car is...

471
01:24:46,128 --> 01:24:47,322
What?

472
01:24:50,198 --> 01:24:51,859
Could it have been deliberate?

473
01:24:54,503 --> 01:24:55,970
One of your suitors?

474
01:25:15,557 --> 01:25:17,081
It was Vaughan.

475
01:25:34,142 --> 01:25:35,939
The traffic.

476
01:25:37,078 --> 01:25:38,375
Where is everyone?

477
01:25:40,015 --> 01:25:41,414
They've all gone away.

478
01:25:46,988 --> 01:25:48,717
I'd like to go back, James.

479
01:28:37,993 --> 01:28:40,518
He came from up there, overhead!

480
01:30:35,510 --> 01:30:39,776
I'd like to register a claim
for the 1963 black Lincoln.

481
01:30:39,814 --> 01:30:41,941
Is there a form
I should fill out?

482
01:30:43,151 --> 01:30:45,619
I can give you the forms now...

483
01:30:45,653 --> 01:30:48,144
but you'll have to come back
between 7:30 and 4:30...

484
01:30:48,189 --> 01:30:50,020
to register a claim.

485
01:30:51,025 --> 01:30:52,788
What's your attachment
to that thing?

486
01:30:54,996 --> 01:30:57,021
A close friend owned it.

487
01:30:57,065 --> 01:30:58,623
It's a total write-off.

488
01:30:58,666 --> 01:31:01,294
I don't see what you
can possibly do with it.

489
01:34:33,915 --> 01:34:35,644
Are you all right?

490
01:34:47,095 --> 01:34:48,722
I don't know.

491
01:34:50,932 --> 01:34:52,729
Are you hurt?

492
01:34:56,404 --> 01:34:58,395
I think I'm all right.

493
01:35:07,448 --> 01:35:09,313
I think I'm all right.

494
01:35:29,637 --> 01:35:31,298
Maybe the next one, darling.

495
01:35:42,784 --> 01:35:44,513
Maybe the next one.
