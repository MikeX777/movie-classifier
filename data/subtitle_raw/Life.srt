LIFE

Written by Lu Yao

00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:08,379
Under the sky lies the Yellow River

5
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:18,969
which has many turns and twists

6
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,980
which there are dozens of boats

7
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:31,510
which there are dozens of boats

8
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:41,150
supported by dozens of masts

9
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:49,760
which are steered by sailors

10
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:58,799
which are steered by sailors

11
00:01:58,849 --> 00:02:07,150
Alas...

12
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,849
Don't cry

13
00:03:23,259 --> 00:03:24,879
I'll fight with GaoMinglou

14
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:27,490
even if at the cost of my life

15
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,460
Jialin!

16
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:31,960
Jialin! Off your hand

17
00:03:32,169 --> 00:03:33,259
Let me go!

18
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,180
Let me go!

19
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,939
please don't make trouble!

20
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,669
I have worked as a teacher for three years

21
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:42,610
When didn't I work very well

22
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:45,379
He has just graduated
from senior high school

23
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:47,169
Why can he replace me?

24
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:50,150
It is just because
he is a secretary, isn't it?

25
00:03:50,729 --> 00:03:54,159
He is not only arbitrary but also shameless

26
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,909
Jialin! Jialin! Oh, Jialin

27
00:03:59,169 --> 00:04:03,259
I won't kill him but write to accuse them

28
00:04:03,669 --> 00:04:09,300
If you charge them
our family won't have a way out

29
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,500
They have direct access
to the high government authorities

30
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,310
Look, what a dog's life I lead!

31
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,529
Oh, Oh, Oh

32
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,649
Go! Go!

33
00:05:07,329 --> 00:05:11,160
Oh, Oh

34
00:05:22,149 --> 00:05:24,110
Oh, Oh

35
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:32,550
Jialin

36
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,620
Don't dig

37
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:47,129
Stop! Do you want to tire yourself out?

38
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,769
Put down your hoe and give it to me.

39
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:52,540
You stubborn guy
don't do it rashly like this!

40
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,939
Do you think the hoe as a pen?

41
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,310
Let's go!

42
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,649
Come on!

43
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,879
Sit down here!

44
00:06:07,529 --> 00:06:08,509
Tut-tut

45
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,959
You see
the yellow sand prevents blooding

46
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:19,269
At the beginning
you should spend your strength gradually

47
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:22,709
for the long future

48
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,730
Grandpa Deshun

49
00:06:25,149 --> 00:06:29,079
I want to try all
the painstaking work at the beginning

50
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,310
and then I won't
be afraid of any difficulties

51
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:35,319
But you shouldn't exert
all your strength any way

52
00:06:36,819 --> 00:06:38,720
I feel very confused

53
00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:43,490
I think the hard work
will make me feel better

54
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:56,769
Here you are. Drink all the water

55
00:07:23,269 --> 00:07:26,500
Don't dig the land tomorrow

56
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,970
Learn to plow from me and dig the land
after your injury is cured

57
00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:34,350
and I think it will cure itself

58
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:36,540
and I think it will cure itself

59
00:07:37,949 --> 00:07:41,879
Ok, Jialin

60
00:07:44,689 --> 00:07:46,279
Jialin

61
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:51,649
Hey, Qiaozhen

62
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:58,300
Hey, Qiaozhen

63
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:06,639
Hey, Qiaozhen

64
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:10,069
Uncle Liben, Qiaozhen isn't in now

65
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,980
My relative, Don't yell like this

66
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,420
Are you coming back from the meeting?
Yes

67
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:25,029
Ma Shuan comes to interview her

68
00:08:25,529 --> 00:08:27,649
That damn girl
deliberately avoids meeting him

69
00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:30,290
Well, what are you shouting for?

70
00:08:30,569 --> 00:08:32,289
It will be time to finish the work soon

71
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,029
Hey, Qiaozhen

72
00:08:35,009 --> 00:08:38,409
Why don't you go home
to see your fiance?

73
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,000
Qiuaozhen, let's go!

74
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:45,169
Oh, MaShuan, Mashuan

75
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:49,879
he will tie you up immediately

76
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:54,490
San Xing is a teacher now, isn't he?

77
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:56,080
Ah, ha ha ...

78
00:08:56,129 --> 00:08:58,789
You're so capable of achieving
your purpose

79
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,039
I am not so capable as you now

80
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:02,870
I am not so capable as you now

81
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:06,159
You earn much more money
by doing business

82
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,899
your purse seems to be broken!

83
00:09:09,309 --> 00:09:11,799
You go your way I go mine:

84
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:15,799
You have power and I earn money.

85
00:09:24,129 --> 00:09:25,289
Hey, Mr. Gao

86
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,649
new term has begun now
but why haven't you?

87
00:09:28,659 --> 00:09:30,090
I am not a teacher any more

88
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:32,659
Where are you going?

89
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:34,659
I am going to interview a girl

90
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,529
Who?

91
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,960
The second daughter of the Liu's

92
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,090
Aha, you take the most
beautiful girl in our village

93
00:09:41,139 --> 00:09:42,399
Really...

94
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,500
Don't you know that Qiaozhen is the most
beautiful girl in the neighborhood?

95
00:09:45,549 --> 00:09:48,110
Well, she is really an attractive girl

96
00:09:48,149 --> 00:09:49,809
But I'm afraid I can't win her heart

97
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:52,509
Ha

98
00:10:00,659 --> 00:10:02,179
Why are you back so late?

99
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:08,000
Why are you back so late?

100
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,519
Any way, you should

101
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:11,559
Please talk about it after meal

102
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:14,169
Anyway, you should give us your opinion.
Why do you just keep silent?

103
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:17,470
You are not an honorable person

104
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:22,970
Come back!

105
00:10:26,789 --> 00:10:29,360
Come back!

106
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,909
no longer a baby now

107
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,690
Can't you see him no matter
whether you agree or not?

108
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,529
My elder sister
please mind your own business!

109
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,000
Sister, do you think
your father-in-law a kind person?

110
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,669
Jialin is a model teacher in our community

111
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:49,230
But your father-in-law replaced him
with his own son by hooks and crooks

112
00:10:49,909 --> 00:10:51,460
What an arbitrary person he is!

113
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:53,230
In the Graduation
Examination of senior high school

114
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,570
Sanxing failed in Chinese

115
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,309
and got a zero in Math

116
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:58,139
Hem, how can he work as a teacher?

117
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:02,350
Alas, see how just you are!

118
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,659
Othersâ€™ dog bites strangers but you two
bite your companies deliberately

119
00:11:10,059 --> 00:11:12,250
It's not my father-in-law who laid off Jialin

120
00:11:12,299 --> 00:11:15,259
but the teaching
cadre Ma Zhansheng did alone

121
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:22,960
Your father-in-law and Ma Zhansheng
are birds of a feather

122
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:52,370
The ducks upriver and the goose downriver

123
00:11:52,409 --> 00:11:57,779
Focusing their eyes on their brothers

124
00:11:58,149 --> 00:12:04,110
Cooking the elm fruit and putting
the rice into the boiling water

125
00:12:04,149 --> 00:12:10,210
Picking the fire woods
on the road and glancing at you

126
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:22,330
The clean glass window are brightening

127
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:28,129
Chuckling at you with the teeth white

128
00:12:28,179 --> 00:12:34,269
Anxiously opening the door

129
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,980
Dear honey be back soon

130
00:12:52,299 --> 00:12:53,820
Jialin

131
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:08,309
This is our family plot
I plant it myself

132
00:13:25,029 --> 00:13:29,190
Dad, go home please

133
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:35,370
The county market will open tomorrow

134
00:13:35,409 --> 00:13:38,860
Let your mother make some bread and
you can go to sell them on the market

135
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:42,870
That's easier than the work in the field

136
00:13:44,549 --> 00:13:46,779
Then I can buy a carton
of cigarettes for you

137
00:14:24,429 --> 00:14:26,389
I've heard that his uncle

138
00:14:26,629 --> 00:14:29,289
has been an official
now in the army in Xinjiang

139
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:33,460
We may let Jialin go to meet his uncle

140
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:39,360
and maybe he can find a job
in the town with his help

141
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:44,009
It's said the population over there
is sparse so it is easy to find a job

142
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,240
It is so far away and our child
has never traveled such a long journey

143
00:14:52,049 --> 00:14:54,450
so I can't feel at ease

144
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:00,279
I don't agree

145
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:45,460
You'd better see him first
in your next meeting

146
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:48,629
Tl go too. See you then!

147
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:53,409
Hey, Qiaozhen! Qiaozhen!

148
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:37,279
Yaping, let's return those books

149
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,250
Where are they. Please try to find them

150
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:40,409
Ok

151
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,320
GaoJialin?!

152
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,750
Jialin!

153
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,590
Jialin! Hello!

154
00:16:47,629 --> 00:16:48,889
Jialin! Hi!

155
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,200
Where are you going?

156
00:16:50,899 --> 00:16:52,450
To see a relative
Really?

157
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:57,269
You're really talented

158
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:00,070
I have read the essays you
wrote on the local newspaper

159
00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:01,440
Your style of writing is so excellent

160
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,409
Jialin, are you still working as a teacher?

161
00:17:04,049 --> 00:17:07,210
Replaced by the son of the Secretary

162
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:09,420
I am only a community member now

163
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,980
Then do you have less time for writing?

164
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:17,289
No, much more now

165
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:19,289
A poet said that

166
00:17:19,529 --> 00:17:23,150
we write down numerous lines
of poetry with the hoes in the land

167
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,650
Ha ha ha ha

168
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:27,720
Where are you going ?

169
00:17:27,779 --> 00:17:29,329
On a business trip to Taiyuan City

170
00:17:29,579 --> 00:17:31,869
Are you still a buyer in the food company

171
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,799
I have been promoted
as the department dean

172
00:17:35,849 --> 00:17:37,680
but there is a "vice" before "dean"

173
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,480
Jialin, if you want to buy cigarettes
alcohol or something like that

174
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:42,980
just let me know and I am sure
to offer you some help

175
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:47,359
please drop in to our broadcasting studio

176
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:48,880
please drop in to our broadcasting studio

177
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:53,349
I want to ask
you some questions on literature

178
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,220
You are now in a high position

179
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:58,700
It's unavailable for the common people
in the mountainous area to contact

180
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,569
Attention, please

181
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,529
It's time for No.308 train to leave
I see, you have not improved
your stubborn disposition

182
00:18:03,579 --> 00:18:06,339
Passengers going to Taiyuan get
on the train quickly, please

183
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,930
See you then!

184
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:10,170
It's time for No.308 train to leave
See you

185
00:18:10,579 --> 00:18:13,839
The passengers going to Taiyuan get
on the train quickly, please

186
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,509
Hey, Jialin

187
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:45,470
Jialin

188
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:49,420
are you coming to the market here?

189
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,539
are you coming to the market here?

190
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,490
To sell bread

191
00:19:03,269 --> 00:19:06,359
Jialin, don't hate me

192
00:19:06,609 --> 00:19:09,009
I am not the decisive guy in that matter

193
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,839
GaoMinglou and Secretary Zhang have
been close friends for so many years

194
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,640
How do you think, I should do?

195
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,369
I know much about you

196
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:19,279
Mr. Ma, don't mention it any more

197
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,720
Mr. Ma, don't mention it any more

198
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,839
I have been transferred to
the Labor Bureau of the county now

199
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:26,180
It may be called a promotion

200
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,319
I'm now a vice-director in the Labor Bureau

201
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:29,349
Hahaha, as a newly appointed official

202
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,359
I am busy to death

203
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:03,619
Leave it alone if you don't want

204
00:22:03,619 --> 00:22:04,980
Leave it alone if you don't want

205
00:23:26,829 --> 00:23:30,059
Jialin, Jialin

206
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,569
did you go to sell bread?

207
00:23:33,809 --> 00:23:36,900
Yeah. Have you also come to the market?

208
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:41,339
Yes, I come here for nothing

209
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:47,599
Jialin, I know you
haven't sold a single bread

210
00:23:48,259 --> 00:23:50,190
You are afraid of losing face

211
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,200
You are afraid of losing face

212
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,029
Let me sell them for you

213
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:08,210
and my mother hope you
would have a taste

214
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:09,670
and my mother hope you
would have a taste

215
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,160
Hey, Qiaozhen, Stay here for dinner

216
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:14,500
No, thanks. It's getting dark

217
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:21,750
No, thanks. It's getting dark

218
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,470
Please check it

219
00:25:25,089 --> 00:25:27,920
Qiaozhen, you are so capable!

220
00:25:29,059 --> 00:25:31,990
The sun is setting
so you'd better go home first

221
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,119
Let's go together

222
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,460
I can't carry you on the bike

223
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,390
I'm afraid to throw you off

224
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,700
Then let me carry you

225
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:46,230
That won't do

226
00:26:00,589 --> 00:26:04,519
Well, we don't ride bike
and walk home

227
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:13,819
You are tired
so let me push the bike

228
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:36,140
Green willows are growing tall

229
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:42,220
What do you love me for?

230
00:26:42,259 --> 00:26:48,490
Horses are not the same height

231
00:26:49,569 --> 00:26:51,440
Brother Jialin
don't struggle too hard

232
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,740
Brother Jialin
don't struggle too hard

233
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:59,009
You are getting thinner these days

234
00:27:00,849 --> 00:27:04,279
In fact, it's also good to be a farmer

235
00:27:04,819 --> 00:27:07,250
because there are a large
number of farmers on the earth

236
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:12,549
There are hills
rivers and fresh air in our countryside

237
00:27:15,029 --> 00:27:17,150
If you have a comfortable family

238
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,859
you can also live a happy life there

239
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:30,400
Neither can I get a position in school

240
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,460
nor can I do hard work in the field

241
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:39,710
As a peasant without
strength and farming skill

242
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:47,279
I might starve my wife and children to
death in the future. What will I do?

243
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:56,440
if you don't look down on me

244
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,700
Pardon?

245
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:06,559
You stay at home
and I work in the field

246
00:28:08,549 --> 00:28:10,450
I won't let you suffer

247
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:19,079
It's dark now. Let's go

248
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:37,700
Why did you suddenly have such an idea?

249
00:28:38,339 --> 00:28:40,000
Not suddenly

250
00:28:41,509 --> 00:28:44,869
I have been thinking
about it these years

251
00:28:47,819 --> 00:28:50,940
I can't expect it when you were a teacher

252
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,650
Now you are laid off

253
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:59,819
I feel both sad and happy

254
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:07,630
I may have a chance
I think, since you are a peasant now

255
00:29:24,819 --> 00:29:27,680
Here you are. Have a cigarette

256
00:29:28,029 --> 00:29:29,990
I have bought a carbon for you
Here you are

257
00:29:41,069 --> 00:29:42,529
Iodine?

258
00:29:42,579 --> 00:29:44,809
put some on your wounds when back home

259
00:29:47,579 --> 00:29:49,539
How did you know my hand

260
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:51,440
I did know

261
00:29:52,089 --> 00:29:55,279
A teacher's hands are very fragile

262
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:01,250
Are you feeling better now?

263
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:08,359
Listen, It's ok now

264
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:09,579
Well

265
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:15,690
Don't run away! Stop! Stop!
Don't run away

266
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:20,140
Hey!...

267
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:25,539
Ha Ha...

268
00:31:25,579 --> 00:31:31,950
Let me off, please!
It doesn't matter.

269
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:19,480
I know you didn't
have supper this evening

270
00:33:20,029 --> 00:33:21,990
People like us working
in the field year in year out

271
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,660
always feel too tired to have supper
after a full-day's fieldwork

272
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:26,650
let alone you

273
00:33:34,069 --> 00:33:35,900
If you don't visit me

274
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,529
I must send it to your home

275
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:41,799
You shouldn't do that

276
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,710
If your father knows this matter

277
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:47,170
he will break my legs

278
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,119
Brother Jialin Yeah?

279
00:33:57,559 --> 00:34:01,890
Whenever I see you
I feel you are closer than my parents

280
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,239
Grandpa Deshun

281
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,539
Hey, Qiaozhen
are you going to pick pig-food?

282
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:22,980
Yeah

283
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:28,110
Grandpa Deshun

284
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,289
the jujubes on our trees have turned red

285
00:34:30,329 --> 00:34:33,019
Please taste some fresh ones. Ok

286
00:34:57,719 --> 00:34:59,110
Jialin Ah!

287
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:01,320
Come to taste some jujube
Come over please

288
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,719
Thanks!

289
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:12,960
Here you are

290
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:22,400
Jialin Yeah?

291
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,829
Do you want a girlfriend?

292
00:35:26,289 --> 00:35:29,219
Yeah, but none proper

293
00:35:30,389 --> 00:35:32,409
How about Qiaozhen?

294
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:39,019
I believe that you two seem
to be born for one another

295
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,429
Well

296
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,059
You have a good judgment.

297
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:51,059
Grandpa Deshun
I have never thought about her

298
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:54,539
Don't tell lie
I figured it out long time ago

299
00:35:54,579 --> 00:35:56,269
Hum, let's go!

300
00:36:04,289 --> 00:36:06,849
Grandpa Deshun
don't gossip it with others, please

301
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:10,690
Take it easy

302
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:14,659
I won't tell anybody

303
00:36:14,699 --> 00:36:16,630
Ha ha ha

304
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:21,030
Well, I feel so happy for you two

305
00:36:23,539 --> 00:36:28,059
Well, just like the words in the old songs

306
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:37,840
you two are born a perfect match

307
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:48,730
Qiaozhen has her boyfriend

308
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:51,559
Qiaozhen has her boyfriend

309
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:53,000
Who?

310
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:55,639
How did you say to him?

311
00:36:56,340 --> 00:37:02,639
I said, that's just you

312
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,110
Really? Yeah

313
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:11,219
How did you dare to?

314
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:23,630
Egg shells are used to light
and only half the bed is bright

315
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:32,599
Small wine cups are used to measure the
rice and your poverty I don't dislike

316
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:37,980
Neither for your house nor for your land

317
00:37:38,019 --> 00:37:40,070
Are you singing a song called
"Waiting fort brother"

318
00:37:41,489 --> 00:37:48,050
The ducks upriver
and the goose downriver

319
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:53,579
Focusing their eyes on their brothers

320
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:59,500
Cooking the elm fruit and putting
the rice into the boiling water

321
00:37:59,769 --> 00:38:03,789
Picking the fire woods on the road

322
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,630
Brother Jialin, Jialin

323
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:08,440
Look, how tired you are!

324
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:10,670
You'd better rest a day tomorrow

325
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:17,989
Twill let you rest
for one day every week

326
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:22,920
just as you had when in school

327
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,099
just as you had when in school

328
00:38:25,099 --> 00:38:28,090
Run away quickly!

329
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:28,889
Don't beat me, Dad

330
00:38:28,929 --> 00:38:31,219
I beat you to death. Shameless!
Please stop, Dad

331
00:38:31,269 --> 00:38:33,429
How dare you want to marry

332
00:38:33,469 --> 00:38:34,440
to that black sheep

333
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:37,000
By Jove! I can feel
all the villagers smirking behind me

334
00:38:37,579 --> 00:38:39,199
She would lose my face
if I don't beat her to death

335
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,539
Elder sister, run away quickly!

336
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:42,739
I must beat you
a law-down dirty shame, to death

337
00:38:48,389 --> 00:38:49,110
Jialin

338
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:50,710
Dad, that's enough!

339
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,650
Don't think about it any more

340
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:59,559
In this plight we are not able
to pursue a marriage with her

341
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:01,820
Who is pursuing?

342
00:39:01,869 --> 00:39:04,489
You would
be good-for-nothing all your life

343
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:09,630
I will make a decision for my own
Just mind your own business

344
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:12,840
If you don't instruct your son strictly

345
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,840
and if I find him luring my daughter

346
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,000
I will break his legs!

347
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,250
I will break his legs!

348
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:20,909
I will scalp you

349
00:39:21,489 --> 00:39:22,880
I won't give up!

350
00:39:23,619 --> 00:39:25,309
Let's go and see!

351
00:39:25,789 --> 00:39:27,880
I don't believe
I can't conquer you two

352
00:39:28,789 --> 00:39:31,409
Hum, there are laws governing you!

353
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:36,650
Alas. It is nothing
but their love, isn't it?

354
00:39:36,699 --> 00:39:38,159
Damn love!

355
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:40,010
Damn love!

356
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:41,769
how can you two flirt with each
other outside every night?

357
00:39:41,809 --> 00:39:43,639
You have shamed us all

358
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:46,969
Why aren't you open-minded
since you well-traveled

359
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:49,260
and a man of wide experience?

360
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:53,050
Today the young are different
from us in the old times

361
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:55,780
There are so many new things you
have never seen or heard of

362
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:57,480
Several years ago

363
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:01,079
Come on!....

364
00:40:01,329 --> 00:40:03,989
When I passed Xi'an and Taiyuan
to visit the famous Dazhai Village

365
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:07,719
I saw many young men and women
walking on the streets

366
00:40:07,769 --> 00:40:12,130
hand by hand during the daytime

367
00:40:12,809 --> 00:40:15,309
hand by hand during the daytime

368
00:40:15,309 --> 00:40:16,769
He will ruin my Qiaozhen

369
00:40:16,809 --> 00:40:20,139
What? GaoJialin is
a senior high school graduate

370
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:23,320


371
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,909
Why do you look down on Jialin

372
00:40:24,949 --> 00:40:26,380
A senior high school student
is good for nothing

373
00:40:27,219 --> 00:40:28,880
He also has to whip the ox ass

374
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,820
Come on

375
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:34,130
He is not able to whip the ox ass

376
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:36,750
you shouldn't
look down on Gao Jialin.

377
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:40,889
GaoJialin is not only a learned young man
but also a hardworking guy

378
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:42,889
In this village

379
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:47,070
few people of his age can match him

380
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,969
People now regard

381
00:40:48,969 --> 00:40:51,130
us two as the most capable men

382
00:40:51,179 --> 00:40:55,940
Capable men! It is he that will be the real
capable man in our village in the future

383
00:40:56,619 --> 00:40:57,880
To tell you the truth

384
00:40:58,119 --> 00:41:01,570
I really felt happy
when I learned about that news

385
00:41:01,619 --> 00:41:05,610
You see
If QiaoZhen marry toJialin

386
00:41:05,659 --> 00:41:09,989
you and I both are his relatives

387
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:11,559
you and I both are his relatives

388
00:41:11,559 --> 00:41:13,550
You have said so much pleasant words

389
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:15,130
so I can't push her

390
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:17,219
into a dark hole

391
00:41:17,269 --> 00:41:19,869
so I can't push her
into a dark hole

392
00:41:19,869 --> 00:41:20,760
What can you do?

393
00:41:20,809 --> 00:41:23,039
I will break the legs of that damn guy

394
00:41:23,309 --> 00:41:25,780
Please pay attention

395
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,869
to the punishment of police bureau

396
00:42:12,889 --> 00:42:17,789
Qiaozhen, come down
I have something to tell you

397
00:42:32,849 --> 00:42:36,110
Brother Jialin, what's it?

398
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:38,769
My father is watching us

399
00:42:39,349 --> 00:42:42,840
Don't be afraid
I deliberately let them know

400
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:51,050
Did your father beat you?

401
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:58,230
No. He just scolded me

402
00:42:58,269 --> 00:42:59,989
If he beat you again

403
00:43:00,309 --> 00:43:01,969
I won't forgive him

404
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:05,070
Jialin, don't get so angry

405
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:08,030
My father is a kind-hearted man
with a sharp tongue

406
00:43:08,579 --> 00:43:10,769
He won't be too harsh on me

407
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:15,980
Don't worry
I can make decision in my family

408
00:43:16,019 --> 00:43:17,210
I see

409
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:23,119
It's too dirty!

410
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:30,920
Qiaozhen, let's buy some
bleaching powder in the city

411
00:43:31,539 --> 00:43:34,469
Shall 1 go with you? Yeah

412
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:37,369
Go together. Dare you go?

413
00:43:37,809 --> 00:43:40,000
Yeah. I am going home
to fetch my bike

414
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,539
You go to change your clothes
for a better one

415
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:52,550
Take off this one
and I'll wash it for you tomorrow

416
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:54,420
Ha. What a good wife

417
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:58,650
It sounds too unpleasant

418
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:35,090
Qiaozhen Jialin

419
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:36,519
Hey, GaoJialin, LiuQiaozhen

420
00:44:36,739 --> 00:44:37,860
GaoJialin, LiuQiaozhen

421
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:39,860
Hey, Jialin
I'll let you have Sundays

422
00:44:39,909 --> 00:44:46,369
GaoJialin, LiuQiaozhen.....

423
00:44:46,409 --> 00:44:52,809
GaoJialin, LiuQiaozhen.....

424
00:44:53,050 --> 00:45:01,449
GaoJialin, LiuQiaozhen.....

425
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:04,050
Oh, Oh

426
00:45:04,099 --> 00:45:12,159
GaoJialin, LiuQiaozhen
I will have Sundays!

427
00:45:12,199 --> 00:45:19,360
GaoJialin.....

428
00:45:19,409 --> 00:45:40,420
Hey, Jialin, Take care.

429
00:46:15,699 --> 00:46:17,389
Brother Jialin

430
00:46:18,639 --> 00:46:20,969
You should try going out to work

431
00:46:24,579 --> 00:46:29,239
Really I support you completely
if you can find a job in the town

432
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:37,710
If you really work in town some day

433
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,489
I will plant our reserved field at home

434
00:46:43,429 --> 00:46:45,150
and raise our children

435
00:46:46,829 --> 00:46:51,849
You can come back to see
us whenever you are free

436
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:56,210
and I will take our children there
and live together with you. If lam free

437
00:46:57,639 --> 00:46:59,760
You let me work outside

438
00:47:00,110 --> 00:47:01,630
Aren't you afraid that I will part with you?

439
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:09,239
Don't leave me alone whatever happens

440
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:14,219
For you, it seems that I have got a job

441
00:48:08,309 --> 00:48:11,469
Brother YiDe, Brother YiDe

442
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:13,050
Brother YiDe, Brother YiDe

443
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:14,480
Come and have some together with us

444
00:48:14,519 --> 00:48:16,789
Come and have some together with us

445
00:48:16,789 --> 00:48:20,849
Please help yourselves

446
00:48:21,159 --> 00:48:24,090
The cadres of our village decide
to fetch some dung in the city

447
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,989
It is an easy task

448
00:48:26,329 --> 00:48:29,889
so I want it done
by Jialin and Grandpa Deshun

449
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:31,900
Ha...

450
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:38,929
Jialin, you are really tired these days

451
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:40,769
Alright. I must go now

452
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:44,650
Well, ask Qiaozhen go to cook for you

453
00:48:44,679 --> 00:48:46,969
Her auntie has an empty room in the town

454
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:48,639
Ok. Let's go

455
00:48:49,619 --> 00:48:51,210
See you. Ha. Ha

456
00:48:51,489 --> 00:48:52,780
See you

457
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:22,380
Youth is never but once
It's good to be young..

458
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:29,289
The old men with white beard are useless

459
00:49:29,829 --> 00:49:31,019
What are you laughing at?

460
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:36,590
I am old now

461
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:40,789
but I feel so happy
when I see you, the young people

462
00:49:41,469 --> 00:49:44,840
but I feel so happy
when I see you, the young people

463
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:46,230
Ha ha ha

464
00:49:46,710 --> 00:49:48,329
Grandpa Deshun Yeah?

465
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:49,809
You are single all your life

466
00:49:50,219 --> 00:49:52,809
Did you ever fall in love
with someone when you were young?

467
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:56,550
Ah? Fall in love?

468
00:49:56,590 --> 00:49:57,809
Ah

469
00:49:57,860 --> 00:50:00,949
Oh. When I was young

470
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:03,530
Oh. When I was young

471
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:05,989
Ha ha ha

472
00:50:14,969 --> 00:50:21,559
Alas. At that time
I was as young as you are now

473
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:24,840
When I was free

474
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:31,480
I took my draught animals
outside the village to carry salt
and leather goods for the landlord

475
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:36,250
When I had a rest in a small inn
on the riverside of Wuding Lake

476
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:41,320
I met the daughter of the owner
and we fell in love

477
00:50:43,570 --> 00:50:48,199
Her name was Lingzhuan

478
00:50:48,539 --> 00:50:52,269
and she was more beautiful
than the singer in the county troupe

479
00:50:53,510 --> 00:51:00,500
Every time she knew exactly
when I could arrive there

480
00:51:00,789 --> 00:51:03,980
As soon as I turned up
in the corner of their village

481
00:51:04,789 --> 00:51:08,949
she welcomed me with her songs

482
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:16,429
Her voice was as pleasant as
that of two silver bells ringing

483
00:51:17,639 --> 00:51:23,800
I didn't want

484
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:28,449
to leave after entering that inn

485
00:51:28,449 --> 00:51:32,510
always gave me cake with mutton
buckwheat, and river snail to eat

486
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:40,179
As soon as the night fell
she came to my room stealthily

487
00:51:41,889 --> 00:51:45,010
Every time I left their village

488
00:51:45,829 --> 00:51:48,760
she swept sadly
with tears running down her cheeks

489
00:51:49,329 --> 00:51:52,349
She would send me to the riverside

490
00:51:53,239 --> 00:51:58,139
weeping and singing all the way

491
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:01,639
Did she sing the song called
"Going to Xikou'?

492
00:52:01,679 --> 00:52:03,139
Yeah

493
00:52:06,179 --> 00:52:11,369
Brother, you will go far away

494
00:52:12,119 --> 00:52:18,050
I can't ask you to stay

495
00:52:18,329 --> 00:52:30,429
I have some words to tell you
which you should keep them in mind

496
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:40,119
I have some words to tell you
which you should keep them in mind

497
00:52:40,119 --> 00:52:48,719
not along the path

498
00:52:49,090 --> 00:52:56,920
On the crowded road

499
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:05,769
you can chat with others
not feeling lonely

500
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:15,079
Brother, you will go far away

501
00:53:15,989 --> 00:53:24,789
I see you off

502
00:53:25,159 --> 00:53:33,389
Drawing your hand,

503
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:42,639
I sweep sadly
with my tears down my cheeks

504
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:54,460
I sweep sadly
with my tears down my cheeks

505
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:59,619
I am really old

506
00:54:00,329 --> 00:54:06,860
so that I feel so sentimental
to make my eyes water

507
00:54:06,909 --> 00:54:12,309
Ah. You might laugh at me for this

508
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:16,269
Grandpa Deshun, what about the
following story? Lingzhu, she

509
00:54:18,119 --> 00:54:27,019
Alas. It was said that she married
to a businessman from Tianjin

510
00:54:27,059 --> 00:54:28,989
She was unwilling to marry him

511
00:54:29,329 --> 00:54:33,280
but her father forced her to go with him

512
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:43,829
Oh. Tianjin is a place so far from us

513
00:54:51,949 --> 00:54:54,679
Zhuanling may be alive now

514
00:54:54,989 --> 00:55:02,019
Of course, she is alive! She is alive
as long as I am living in the world

515
00:55:02,329 --> 00:55:06,420
I have her in my heart all the life

516
00:55:48,369 --> 00:55:50,360
Dad, come here to eat the watermelon

517
00:55:50,409 --> 00:55:57,110
Come on. Have a piece

518
00:56:04,059 --> 00:56:05,320
Come on. Have a piece

519
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:06,909
Go to somewhere else to fetch dung

520
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:08,579
Don't you see some people sitting here?

521
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:11,119
You the guy are so impolite!

522
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:30,840
What are you coming to do?
Dare you kill me?

523
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:34,969
Comrade, there is really no other way

524
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:36,940
We chose to fetch dung in the evening

525
00:56:37,219 --> 00:56:39,840
just in order to avoid hindering
your work during the daytime

526
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:43,550
We didn't know you are enjoying
the cool in the evening

527
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:45,760
Well, that's enough!
Please fill your pails and go away.

528
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,289
Please go away quickly. Go away

529
00:56:47,329 --> 00:56:48,719
Go away quickly. It smells so bad!

530
00:56:50,769 --> 00:56:52,760
I am really dirty

531
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:57,139
but I find your mind stinking

532
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:59,099
You say what?

533
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:02,170
Well. That's enough! Go away please!

534
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:03,760
What an impolite person!

535
00:57:42,289 --> 00:57:44,150
I must come here!

536
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:47,619
I have learned so much knowledge

537
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:51,050
and I am as excellent as them

538
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,750
Why should I be insulted like this?

539
00:57:58,769 --> 00:58:02,030
Uncle Gao, here is your letter

540
00:58:06,949 --> 00:58:08,380
from Xingjiang

541
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:12,780
Read it for us. Ok

542
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:27,980
My elder brother and elder sister
how are you

543
00:58:28,030 --> 00:58:30,760
Qiaoling, come here. Sit down to read

544
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:35,360
I have good news to tell you

545
00:58:35,409 --> 00:58:38,340
that I will be transferred
to work in our hometown soon

546
00:58:40,139 --> 00:58:41,800
It is said in the letter sent from
the local government authorities

547
00:58:41,849 --> 00:58:45,480
It is said in the letter sent from
the local government authorities

548
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:47,380
I decide to 
Labor?

549
00:58:48,619 --> 00:58:51,980
Are you also sent home
to work by the government?

550
00:58:52,019 --> 00:58:56,710
No. Auntie

551
00:59:34,969 --> 00:59:36,690
Wrap quickly....

552
00:59:36,730 --> 00:59:38,119
Grandson, give me room

553
00:59:38,469 --> 00:59:39,489
Auntie Hi

554
00:59:39,539 --> 00:59:40,900
I'll go to fetch my table

555
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:41,829
Thank you

556
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,039
You pat one and I pat one

557
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:47,800
a child's driving a plane

558
00:59:47,849 --> 00:59:49,440
You pat two and I pat two

559
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:51,170
two children are plaiting pigtails

560
00:59:51,219 --> 00:59:52,679
You pat three and I pat three

561
00:59:52,719 --> 00:59:54,440
three children are climbing
the snow mountain

562
00:59:54,489 --> 00:59:55,920
You pat four and I pat four

563
00:59:55,949 --> 00:59:57,610
four children are writing big characters

564
00:59:57,659 --> 00:59:59,349
You pat five and I pat five

565
00:59:59,389 --> 01:00:01,090
You pat five and I pat five

566
01:00:01,090 --> 01:00:02,550
You pat Six and I pat Six

567
01:00:02,590 --> 01:00:04,550
Having left home for decades

568
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:07,630
always dreamed to be home

569
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:12,429
I am more than fifty years old now

570
01:00:12,739 --> 01:00:15,969
It is said that the falling
leaves settle on the roots

571
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:17,099
Yes, yes

572
01:00:17,139 --> 01:00:18,800
Yizhi, do you forget

573
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:21,960
that two of us stole the peaches
of Grandpa Deshun in our childhood?

574
01:00:22,010 --> 01:00:24,469
Ha ha ha

575
01:00:24,519 --> 01:00:27,590
Ha ha ha

576
01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:35,820
Ha ha ha

577
01:00:59,849 --> 01:01:01,369
These bowls can't be used
to entertain guests

578
01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:28,170
What are you doing?
Get off, please

579
01:01:43,389 --> 01:01:47,650
Hi, Jialin

580
01:01:47,699 --> 01:01:48,920
Yes?

581
01:01:48,969 --> 01:01:50,630
I don't mention something else

582
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:55,329
I will offer you a job
as soon as possible

583
01:02:03,409 --> 01:02:09,139
As an aged couple

584
01:02:10,090 --> 01:02:12,550
we have nothing to involve you

585
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:22,789
In recent years we have
nothing painstaking under
the better policy of government

586
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:28,230
The only worry is the future of your nephew

587
01:02:29,269 --> 01:02:32,599
He is still doing the fieldwork
after graduation from senior high school

588
01:02:33,710 --> 01:02:36,070
You work as a teacher
in the village school, don't you?

589
01:02:36,110 --> 01:02:37,199
Yes

590
01:02:37,949 --> 01:02:42,280
Now there are fewer students than
before and so fewer teachers are wanted

591
01:02:42,820 --> 01:02:44,909
Thus, he came back

592
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:56,860
Elder brother
you put me in trouble for this matter

593
01:02:57,199 --> 01:03:00,429
I am newly appointed in this position
How can I

594
01:03:00,429 --> 01:03:00,429
I am newly appointed in this position
How can I

595
01:03:00,429 --> 01:03:00,429
I am newly appointed in this position
How can I 

596
01:03:00,429 --> 01:03:00,429
I am newly appointed in this position
How can I 

597
01:03:00,429 --> 01:03:00,429
I am newly appointed in this position
How can I 

598
01:03:00,429 --> 01:03:00,429
I am newly appointed in this position
How can I 

599
01:03:00,429 --> 01:03:00,429
I am newly appointed in this position
How can I 

600
01:03:00,429 --> 01:03:00,429
I am newly appointed in this position
How can I 

601
01:03:00,429 --> 01:03:00,429
I am newly appointed in this position
How can I 

602
01:03:00,429 --> 01:03:00,429
I am newly appointed in this position
How can I 

603
01:03:00,429 --> 01:03:00,429
I am newly appointed in this position
How can I 

604
01:03:00,429 --> 01:03:00,429
I am newly appointed in this position
How can I 

605
01:03:00,429 --> 01:03:10,820
I am newly appointed in this position
How can I 

606
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:14,619
Elder brother, You should understand me

607
01:03:30,030 --> 01:03:31,320
Sanxing, go to call a person!

608
01:03:31,369 --> 01:03:32,349
Ok

609
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:37,730
Did Director Gao mention
to offer Jialin a job in the town?

610
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:43,340
You, I think, are the only wise man
in Gaojiagou village..

611
01:03:44,519 --> 01:03:47,610
Today, who speaks
it out clearly for this kind of matter?
Otherwise he must be a stupid leader.

612
01:03:48,150 --> 01:03:51,079
It depends on a flexible mind of
the persons who work directly under him

613
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:54,050
When you handle the matter well yourself

614
01:03:54,289 --> 01:03:56,119
he may pretend to scold you

615
01:03:56,559 --> 01:04:00,079
But inwardly he can't help
promoting you immediately

616
01:04:00,159 --> 01:04:02,420
Uncle Gao. Here all you come. Oh

617
01:04:02,469 --> 01:04:03,059
They arrived home

618
01:04:03,099 --> 01:04:05,360
Come in please.
Hurry up! Well

619
01:04:06,039 --> 01:04:08,000
Hello, Yizhi

620
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:09,989
Director Gao

621
01:04:10,039 --> 01:04:11,369
Brother YiDe

622
01:04:11,409 --> 01:04:14,199
Director Gao, Secretary Gao has been
waiting for you for along time

623
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:16,010
Why doesn't Jialin come?

624
01:04:16,579 --> 01:04:19,510
That stubborn guy!
It doesn't matter without him.

625
01:04:19,550 --> 01:04:21,599
Let's come in and sit down, please!

626
01:04:21,690 --> 01:04:23,449
Help yourself, Director Gao

627
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:25,949
Help yourselves

628
01:04:26,989 --> 01:04:28,750
Please, drink some more

629
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:35,260
Cheers!

630
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:37,760
Cheers!

631
01:05:51,679 --> 01:05:56,170
Jialin, you should always think of me

632
01:05:56,250 --> 01:05:57,840
Yeah

633
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:03,909
You must love only me

634
01:06:03,989 --> 01:06:05,510
Yeah

635
01:06:51,800 --> 01:07:00,860
The ducks upriver and the goose downriver

636
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:09,849
Focusing their eyes on their brothers

637
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:19,119
Cooking the elm fruit and putting
the rice into the boiling water

638
01:07:19,159 --> 01:07:27,820
Picking the fire woods
on the road and glancing at you

639
01:07:28,070 --> 01:07:36,840
The clean glass window are brightening

640
01:07:37,150 --> 01:07:45,550
Chuckling at you with the teeth white

641
01:07:46,119 --> 01:07:54,489
Anxiously opening the door

642
01:07:54,530 --> 01:08:03,159
Dear honey be back soon

643
01:08:03,670 --> 01:08:12,570
Ah

644
01:08:12,619 --> 01:08:20,890
Anxiously opening the door

645
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:29,699
Dear honey be back soon

646
01:08:30,029 --> 01:08:34,829
Be back soon

647
01:08:34,970 --> 01:08:39,430
Be back soon

648
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:50,770
Be back soon

649
01:10:52,109 --> 01:10:53,199
We're now to broadcast
the message sent by our reporter

650
01:10:53,279 --> 01:10:58,939
GaoJialin from the frontline of
the flood disaster in the Nan Ma River

651
01:10:58,979 --> 01:11:02,310
The title: At the Vital Moment

652
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:07,279
LiuYuhai, the secretary of NanMa River
community was injured in seven points

653
01:11:07,319 --> 01:11:09,109
without sleeping for twenty-four hours

654
01:11:09,659 --> 01:11:11,520
He struggled on the frontline
of flood disaster together

655
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:15,119
with the cadres
and members of the community

656
01:11:15,399 --> 01:11:19,159
His deeds show the strong
will of a communist party member

657
01:11:30,210 --> 01:11:32,399
Comrade Jialin, return for a rest please

658
01:11:32,449 --> 01:11:33,470
OK

659
01:11:34,489 --> 01:11:38,619
Jialin, Jialin

660
01:11:38,659 --> 01:11:40,020
Hello Welcome back

661
01:11:40,460 --> 01:11:42,750
This time, your article is so moving

662
01:11:42,789 --> 01:11:43,949
Thanks. I'm glad to hear that

663
01:11:43,989 --> 01:11:45,890
It's really moving
Not so good as you said

664
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:48,659
I was moved to tears when I read it

665
01:11:48,699 --> 01:11:50,189
Really? Yeah.

666
01:11:51,970 --> 01:11:54,199
Please wash your face. Ok

667
01:11:58,470 --> 01:12:00,729
I am so glad that you are working here

668
01:12:00,779 --> 01:12:02,739
for I have a conversable
partner from now on

669
01:12:03,279 --> 01:12:05,939
To tell you the truth
these years I've felt so bored

670
01:12:05,979 --> 01:12:10,140
for I cannot find a proper
person to chat with in the town

671
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:12,720
You overlooked them

672
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:14,489
You overlooked them

673
01:12:14,489 --> 01:12:16,390
but you don't know much about them

674
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:24,260
Maybe you are too haughty
for the ordinary people to approach

675
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:29,840
but I really feel a little bored

676
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:32,399
but I really feel a little bored

677
01:12:34,279 --> 01:12:37,539
The selected collection of MÃ©rimÃ©e's novels
How did you get it?

678
01:12:37,579 --> 01:12:38,470
Some days ago

679
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:40,210
May I read it first? Yeah

680
01:12:43,689 --> 01:12:45,619
MÃ©rimÃ©e is a realist

681
01:12:45,859 --> 01:12:48,550
but her works are of romantic color

682
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:53,060
I like Carmen's character very much

683
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:54,060
Do you?

684
01:12:54,260 --> 01:12:56,050
She is a liberalist

685
01:12:56,430 --> 01:12:59,289
and she is unwilling to bear
any bandage of the society

686
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:02,670
I expect more romances in our life

687
01:13:04,010 --> 01:13:07,029
By the way. Did you often write poems?

688
01:13:07,609 --> 01:13:09,199
I just want to ask for your help on this

689
01:13:09,810 --> 01:13:11,029
Do you have any new works?

690
01:13:11,079 --> 01:13:13,170
I wrote a short poem last night
Did you?

691
01:13:14,250 --> 01:13:16,680
Here it is. Please read it yourself

692
01:13:36,670 --> 01:13:38,380
but I can't understand

693
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:40,430
but I can't understand

694
01:13:40,479 --> 01:13:43,239
why I should be a wild goose

695
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:46,210
Hehe...

696
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:51,619
I believe you will
understand it gradually

697
01:14:09,569 --> 01:14:11,189
Have lunch at my home, please

698
01:14:12,180 --> 01:14:14,039
I am not used to having meals
in the home of strangers

699
01:14:14,079 --> 01:14:15,369
Am Ia stranger for you?

700
01:14:16,210 --> 01:14:19,970
I meant that I don't know your parents

701
01:14:20,050 --> 01:14:21,739
First time strangers
and second time friends

702
01:14:22,289 --> 01:14:24,649
Thank you for your kindness. But I

703
01:14:24,689 --> 01:14:25,380
Are you afraid of meeting strangers?

704
01:14:25,420 --> 01:14:26,810
No. No

705
01:14:26,859 --> 01:14:28,409
Bumpkin!

706
01:14:29,159 --> 01:14:32,520
I am originally a bumpkin

707
01:14:36,069 --> 01:14:36,960
Who is there?

708
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:38,479
It's me

709
01:14:48,750 --> 01:14:52,310
Yaping, come to my home for lunch

710
01:14:52,750 --> 01:14:53,710
eating the fresh fish

711
01:14:53,750 --> 01:14:55,609
Eating, and eating again
You only know that

712
01:15:10,329 --> 01:15:12,020
Yaping Don't touch me!

713
01:15:20,579 --> 01:15:21,869
What's wrong with you today?

714
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:27,399
Hey, Jialin. Ah

715
01:15:31,789 --> 01:15:34,380
Why are you driving the tractor?

716
01:15:34,420 --> 01:15:35,609
It's boring to be a teacher

717
01:15:36,029 --> 01:15:39,220
MaZhansheng arranged for
me to work in the mechanized
construction team in the county

718
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:41,430
Recently, we've been carrying stones
in GaoJiagou village

719
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:49,289
Qiaozhen sent a package for you
Here you are

720
01:15:51,039 --> 01:15:53,090
Who replaced your position in the school?

721
01:15:53,140 --> 01:15:55,329
Qiaoling did. She hadn't pass
the college entrance examination

722
01:15:56,079 --> 01:15:57,750
Qiaoling did. She hadn't pass
the college entrance examination

723
01:15:57,750 --> 01:16:00,210
I am in Nanguan. OK

724
01:16:01,449 --> 01:16:03,500
Sanxin, wait a moment

725
01:16:08,159 --> 01:16:08,850
Who is there?

726
01:16:08,890 --> 01:16:10,819
It's me

727
01:16:15,199 --> 01:16:16,159
Mum

728
01:16:16,199 --> 01:16:17,220
Well

729
01:16:17,670 --> 01:16:19,630
Zhenzhen, come here, please

730
01:16:23,909 --> 01:16:26,970
These are the candies Jialin
sent to you and your Dad

731
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:32,130
Sanxin has also brought some for us
Put over there

732
01:16:39,119 --> 01:16:41,210
so these are all for you

733
01:17:02,510 --> 01:17:03,840
Why do you come here?

734
01:17:04,750 --> 01:17:06,470
This place isn't your self-reserved land

735
01:17:08,850 --> 01:17:10,310
Your words are so bitter and sharp

736
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:13,710
I meant that it's getting dark
and you are here alone

737
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:15,119
Not only myself

738
01:17:19,100 --> 01:17:19,989
What about Kenan?

739
01:17:20,029 --> 01:17:21,689
He is not my tail

740
01:17:21,930 --> 01:17:22,789
Then who else?

741
01:17:22,829 --> 01:17:23,989
Just you!

742
01:17:25,399 --> 01:17:27,119
Me?

743
01:17:55,130 --> 01:17:56,789
I want to leave

744
01:17:57,069 --> 01:18:00,760
Are you going on errands?
Where are you going?

745
01:18:01,810 --> 01:18:05,300
Not on business
I will leave here forever

746
01:18:08,409 --> 01:18:11,840
My father will
be transferred to wok in Nanjing

747
01:18:13,250 --> 01:18:17,810
my hometown
and I will also work there

748
01:18:24,090 --> 01:18:28,180
It's beautiful in south
whose sceneries are old friends

749
01:18:28,670 --> 01:18:31,630
The sunrise shining over
the river like flowers in bloom

750
01:18:31,670 --> 01:18:34,659
And the river in the spring
turns green and blue

751
01:18:34,909 --> 01:18:36,670
How can I help recalling
the southern land?

752
01:18:36,739 --> 01:18:39,760
While recalling the southern land
the special is Hangzhou

753
01:18:40,439 --> 01:18:42,340
Seeking osmanthus flower in the moon
when staying in the hill temple

754
01:18:42,380 --> 01:18:45,069
And watching the surging tides
while lying in the pavilion

755
01:18:46,550 --> 01:18:48,779
When could I go back for another tour?

756
01:18:59,229 --> 01:19:03,590
Yea, I always dream my hometown

757
01:19:05,899 --> 01:19:07,420
Are you really leaving?

758
01:19:12,340 --> 01:19:14,359
Sure

759
01:19:21,750 --> 01:19:26,380
Suzhou and Hangzhou
are the two paradises on the earth

760
01:19:26,420 --> 01:19:29,909
Xizi Lake is such an attractive site

761
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:33,899
I am not able to visit it in my lifetime

762
01:19:34,659 --> 01:19:36,250
Do you want to go there?

763
01:19:36,729 --> 01:19:40,350
Me? I even expect
to visit the United Nations

764
01:19:40,439 --> 01:19:45,810
I meant whether you would like
to visit Nanjin, Hangzhou, and Shanghai

765
01:19:48,210 --> 01:19:51,939
I won't get the chances
to go on errands in these cities

766
01:19:58,689 --> 01:20:04,119
It's meaningless for me to go there alone

767
01:20:05,329 --> 01:20:06,949
You have Kenan for company

768
01:20:09,630 --> 01:20:13,689
I hope it's you not him
that will accompany me there

769
01:20:17,539 --> 01:20:21,869
You know that
I loved you when we at school

770
01:20:23,310 --> 01:20:28,109
We were too young
to understand love at that time

771
01:20:29,050 --> 01:20:31,670
And then you returned
to your hometown later

772
01:20:32,789 --> 01:20:36,920
And now I see you are the right man I love

773
01:20:42,430 --> 01:20:44,789
Kenan doesn't disgust me

774
01:20:45,369 --> 01:20:47,659
but I cannot be stirred by him

775
01:20:48,100 --> 01:20:51,789
In fact, my parents like him more

776
01:20:58,010 --> 01:20:59,939
Let's live together

777
01:21:00,180 --> 01:21:01,939
Go to Nanjing with our family

778
01:21:04,850 --> 01:21:07,060
Go to Nanjing with our family

779
01:21:07,060 --> 01:21:09,520
You'll have
a bright future in a big city

780
01:21:09,590 --> 01:21:13,579
I'm sure to ask my father
manage to transfer
you to work as a reporter in Jiangsu

781
01:21:31,850 --> 01:21:32,939
Qiaozhen

782
01:21:33,180 --> 01:21:35,270
Jialin

783
01:21:36,590 --> 01:21:40,109
right now the doorkeeper said
you were not here and didn't let me in

784
01:21:40,159 --> 01:21:42,949
Well. I went to Liujiagou village
for an interview. Get in

785
01:21:42,989 --> 01:21:44,149
Ok

786
01:21:53,439 --> 01:21:55,130
Are you back now? Yeah

787
01:22:15,590 --> 01:22:18,210
Go to my office, please All right

788
01:23:07,579 --> 01:23:09,170
Here is not the crop field

789
01:23:09,449 --> 01:23:10,970
My superiors are just in the next room

790
01:23:15,550 --> 01:23:18,239
You haven't ever come home since you left

791
01:23:19,260 --> 01:23:21,279
I've been here several times
expecting to see you

792
01:23:21,890 --> 01:23:23,680
but they told me you had gone
to the countryside

793
01:23:23,729 --> 01:23:25,600


794
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:29,829
Sit down please. Well

795
01:23:35,310 --> 01:23:36,770
Let me tidy it for you

796
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:38,060
Thanks

797
01:23:49,090 --> 01:23:50,710
The quilt is too thin

798
01:23:51,220 --> 01:23:52,979
I will bring you some new cotton next time

799
01:23:56,289 --> 01:24:00,050
It's getting cold and you cannot
sleep with a single underlay

800
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:03,199
I'll also bring you my own tick of dog skin

801
01:24:03,229 --> 01:24:05,130
Please don't do that

802
01:24:05,569 --> 01:24:08,029
It's hairy and will sure be laughable

803
01:24:08,069 --> 01:24:09,500
The dog skin is very warm

804
01:24:10,069 --> 01:24:12,800
I am not cold, and, you see
I have a stove there

805
01:24:22,020 --> 01:24:24,279
Sanxin is driving the tractor

806
01:24:24,319 --> 01:24:28,840
and Qiaoling is a teacher now. She failed
in the college entrance examination

807
01:24:28,890 --> 01:24:32,319
Well. Sanxin has told me those things

808
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:37,560
Your sow gave birth to twelve piglets

809
01:24:38,300 --> 01:24:40,630
with one crashed
by the sow and left only

810
01:24:40,670 --> 01:24:42,029
Eleven piglets left

811
01:24:43,340 --> 01:24:45,170
Yes, eleven left

812
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:47,270
but one died the next day

813
01:24:47,310 --> 01:24:47,960
Really?

814
01:24:48,010 --> 01:24:48,970
Originally

815
01:24:49,010 --> 01:24:50,529
Please drink some water

816
01:25:36,590 --> 01:25:38,880
I'll go to buy the meal
and we eat together

817
01:25:38,930 --> 01:25:41,090
No. I am not hungry

818
01:25:41,329 --> 01:25:42,949
I must go home early

819
01:25:43,970 --> 01:25:45,630
In order to get a lift in Sanxin's tractor

820
01:25:45,670 --> 01:25:48,399
I left my hoe in the field
and didn't tell my family

821
01:25:48,439 --> 01:25:50,600
Er. It

822
01:25:51,939 --> 01:25:55,460
Brother Jialin
you need more expenses in the town

823
01:25:55,810 --> 01:25:57,140
but your salary is not high

824
01:25:58,310 --> 01:26:00,800
so take this fifty-yuan with you

825
01:26:01,119 --> 01:26:04,310
You can buy something else to eat
if the breakfast is not enough for you

826
01:26:05,020 --> 01:26:06,949
I will buy you a pair of sneakers

827
01:26:07,460 --> 01:26:11,050
Sanxin told me that you often play balls
which abrades shoes very much

828
01:26:12,760 --> 01:26:15,489
The bonus of the first
half-year has been allotted

829
01:26:16,670 --> 01:26:18,659
and I got ninety-two yuan

830
01:26:19,399 --> 01:26:23,329
Now I have salary
and the royalties for my articles

831
01:26:24,069 --> 01:26:25,289
You should keep it yourself

832
01:26:25,340 --> 01:26:26,960
and buy some fashionable clothes

833
01:26:27,010 --> 01:26:28,699
No. This is for you

834
01:26:28,949 --> 01:26:31,680
I, I have my own

835
01:26:33,350 --> 01:26:36,470
Don't reject like that or I'll get angry

836
01:26:40,119 --> 01:26:43,449
Well, I'll keep it for you

837
01:26:43,729 --> 01:26:46,520
And I will give it back
to you whenever you need

838
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:47,779
Ok

839
01:27:02,140 --> 01:27:06,939
I bought it for you long
time ago but forgot to send to you

840
01:27:09,949 --> 01:27:12,710
Come on. Let me help you wear it

841
01:27:59,170 --> 01:28:02,729
Lingling, I beg you for a help

842
01:28:04,739 --> 01:28:06,029
Tell me please

843
01:28:11,779 --> 01:28:13,829
Could you teach me to read?

844
01:28:16,289 --> 01:28:18,189
I learn ten words every day

845
01:28:19,119 --> 01:28:24,279
and I am able to read and write in a year

846
01:28:28,529 --> 01:28:29,859
My elder sister!

847
01:28:44,109 --> 01:28:47,340
I am willing to be a hovering wild goose

848
01:28:47,550 --> 01:28:50,479
loving the blue sky freely

849
01:29:07,869 --> 01:29:11,229
Your sow gave birth to twelve piglets

850
01:29:12,109 --> 01:29:16,909
and one was crashed
by the sow, crashed

851
01:29:19,279 --> 01:29:21,640
I loved you when we at school

852
01:29:22,720 --> 01:29:25,550
You are the right man I love

853
01:29:27,560 --> 01:29:31,319
Brother Jialin, Brother Jialin

854
01:29:32,930 --> 01:29:35,260
I am your only love

855
01:29:38,399 --> 01:29:40,760
Never leave me alone whatever happens

856
01:29:54,250 --> 01:29:56,010
How to write the word "Gao"?

857
01:29:57,149 --> 01:29:58,079
Which "Gao"?

858
01:29:58,119 --> 01:30:01,640
That's thatâ€™s the "Gao"

859
01:30:23,180 --> 01:30:26,239
Gao-Jia-lin

860
01:30:26,279 --> 01:30:27,470
Ha ha ha

861
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:29,039
Who asked you to write these words

862
01:30:29,090 --> 01:30:31,380
Ha Ha Ha

863
01:30:36,689 --> 01:30:39,979
You want to marry
an illiterate country woman!

864
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:42,079
Yea

865
01:30:42,630 --> 01:30:47,649
I can't understand
why a talented senior high school graduate

866
01:30:47,699 --> 01:30:50,489
wants to marry an illiterate countrywoman

867
01:30:50,539 --> 01:30:52,560
You are destroying yourself

868
01:30:52,609 --> 01:30:56,439
That's enough. At that time

869
01:30:56,680 --> 01:30:58,539
I was a dusty peasant

870
01:30:58,779 --> 01:31:01,069
Did any city lady like you would love me?

871
01:31:07,359 --> 01:31:09,479
How ferocious you are!

872
01:31:40,319 --> 01:31:42,909
I am a bad-tempered man

873
01:31:44,329 --> 01:31:47,779
and you can't bear me
if you live with me

874
01:31:50,899 --> 01:31:56,420
Did you mean
that you agree to live with me?

875
01:31:58,270 --> 01:31:59,729
Jialin

876
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:03,840
I have to explain to Qiaozhen first

877
01:32:04,949 --> 01:32:06,779
You know,

878
01:32:07,979 --> 01:32:09,840
I feel so sorry

879
01:32:09,890 --> 01:32:13,979
Yeah, you should
end up your tragedy quickly

880
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:18,340
Maybe it would be an tragic ending

881
01:32:46,859 --> 01:32:49,090
When did GaoJialin
and Yaping date with each other?

882
01:32:53,699 --> 01:32:55,819
You're a worthless wretch

883
01:32:58,029 --> 01:33:02,619
Hum. How dare that guy bully us?

884
01:33:05,109 --> 01:33:11,670
Under the sky lies the Yellow River

885
01:33:12,149 --> 01:33:22,319
which has many turns and twists

886
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:28,279
many turns and twists

887
01:33:28,329 --> 01:33:38,840
many turns and twists

888
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:39,819
dozens of boats

889
01:34:07,970 --> 01:34:10,829
Jialin, what's the matter with you?

890
01:34:13,010 --> 01:34:15,600
Yesterday Sanxin took
your message to ask me to come here

891
01:34:15,680 --> 01:34:19,170
I worried about you for the
whole night supposing you were ill

892
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:25,550
Jialin, please have a look
at the words I wrote

893
01:34:31,529 --> 01:34:33,050
Qiaoling taught me to write

894
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:43,850
I can't write well now

895
01:34:51,810 --> 01:34:53,399
Qiaozhen

896
01:35:02,189 --> 01:35:04,149
I have something to tell you

897
01:35:04,630 --> 01:35:06,529
But it is hard to speak out

898
01:35:09,069 --> 01:35:11,770
if you have something to tell

899
01:35:11,770 --> 01:35:13,560
if you have something to tell

900
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:15,220
Don't hide it in your heart

901
01:35:20,539 --> 01:35:24,300
If I tell you
I am worried that you will cry

902
01:35:29,850 --> 01:35:34,979
Tell me please. I won't cry

903
01:35:38,430 --> 01:35:39,859
Qiaozhen

904
01:35:41,659 --> 01:35:46,489
I will be transferred
to work thousands of miles away

905
01:35:48,500 --> 01:35:50,399
We

906
01:36:17,100 --> 01:36:19,000
what about you?

907
01:36:26,140 --> 01:36:28,069
Qiaozhen Jialin

908
01:36:30,010 --> 01:36:31,970
that's enough

909
01:36:33,680 --> 01:36:35,909
I see what you mean

910
01:36:37,590 --> 01:36:40,489
You, you just go there please

911
01:36:40,720 --> 01:36:42,880
I won't prevent you

912
01:36:45,659 --> 01:36:50,590
Jialin, I have thought
about our relations for numerous times

913
01:36:52,500 --> 01:36:54,619
since you worked in the county

914
01:36:57,210 --> 01:37:03,239
Though I love you dear
I know I can't match you.

915
01:37:05,979 --> 01:37:07,770
I am illiterate

916
01:37:08,579 --> 01:37:14,039
I am not able to assist you
but to encumber your work

917
01:37:18,529 --> 01:37:27,020
You just go outside
and find a better wife than me

918
01:37:29,210 --> 01:37:32,229
Unlike in our native village

919
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:36,970
you should take more care of yourself
in a completely new place

920
01:37:38,810 --> 01:37:40,359
Jialin

921
01:37:41,050 --> 01:37:44,409
you don't know how much I love you

922
01:37:44,449 --> 01:37:45,880
Qiaozhen

923
01:38:01,140 --> 01:38:04,869
Qiaozhen. Don't cry please

924
01:38:10,350 --> 01:38:13,800
Jialin, I must be off now

925
01:38:18,750 --> 01:38:20,140
Qiaozhen!

926
01:39:57,220 --> 01:40:00,279
You should have
rooted yourself in this land

927
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:03,649
But now...

928
01:40:03,689 --> 01:40:06,449
you have become a bean sprout

929
01:40:07,260 --> 01:40:10,250
without any earth on the root

930
01:40:11,899 --> 01:40:13,689
Hum!

931
01:40:21,210 --> 01:40:24,000
You have sold your conscience

932
01:40:24,579 --> 01:40:27,220
but you

933
01:40:27,220 --> 01:40:30,880
she is a piece of gold

934
01:40:30,920 --> 01:40:33,210
You leave her alone on the half way

935
01:40:33,590 --> 01:40:36,649
You, you are committing a sin
You

936
01:40:40,829 --> 01:40:42,020
Hum!

937
01:40:50,510 --> 01:40:56,270
When we were about forty years old
your mother gave birth to you
the only child of us

938
01:40:58,680 --> 01:41:04,579
We are always fearing that you might
be caught into trouble in your life

939
01:41:05,789 --> 01:41:09,079
We didn't expect that you

940
01:41:37,789 --> 01:41:39,979
Maybe you are right

941
01:41:40,920 --> 01:41:44,609
But I can't return in the way of advance

942
01:41:50,170 --> 01:41:56,000
Moreover, you have your
way of life while I have my own

943
01:41:58,409 --> 01:42:00,430
I am unwilling to live like you

944
01:42:00,739 --> 01:42:04,170
digging the land
in Gaojiagou village all the life

945
01:42:11,319 --> 01:42:13,550
That damned GaoYude!

946
01:42:13,590 --> 01:42:19,649
Fuck him! Gangster!
He must die a sudden death

947
01:42:21,229 --> 01:42:27,359
The thunders must
burn him as a black charcoal stake

948
01:42:28,300 --> 01:42:36,899
Dad, don't scold him. Don't curse him

949
01:42:44,449 --> 01:42:46,310
Forget him

950
01:42:47,560 --> 01:42:49,420
Zhenzhen

951
01:42:53,300 --> 01:42:55,199
You shouldn't feel too sad

952
01:42:58,100 --> 01:43:06,000
Zhenzhen, don't ruin yourself for you
haven't begin your wonderful life

953
01:43:27,529 --> 01:43:34,800
I embarrassed him
before for the sake of you

954
01:43:35,270 --> 01:43:39,260
Alas. 1 don't compel you in this matter

955
01:43:41,640 --> 01:43:45,539
However, you are old enough for marriage

956
01:43:46,279 --> 01:43:49,970
You'd better choose a husband by yourself

957
01:43:50,020 --> 01:43:51,880
You shouldn't shoot too high

958
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:55,289
Dad made you illiterate

959
01:43:55,560 --> 01:43:59,319
and you'd better choose an honest farmer

960
01:44:05,930 --> 01:44:09,119
Later, I heard
that you dated with Mr.Gao

961
01:44:09,640 --> 01:44:11,539
and then I felt very disappointed

962
01:44:12,039 --> 01:44:13,439
and then I felt very disappointed

963
01:44:13,439 --> 01:44:17,270
I heard that Mr.Gao fell
in love with a city girl

964
01:44:17,310 --> 01:44:21,109
and parted with you. And then I felt

965
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:31,510
I have become a infamous woman
all over this village

966
01:44:33,560 --> 01:44:34,750
Don't you look down on me?

967
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:37,590
No, I don't. It doesn't matter

968
01:44:37,930 --> 01:44:40,689
The young people always
experience much frustration

969
01:44:40,739 --> 01:44:43,529
What's more, don't hate Mr.Gao

970
01:44:43,840 --> 01:44:45,800
He is a government cadre now

971
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:49,170
but you are an illiterate country girl so
it's impossible for you two to live together

972
01:44:49,779 --> 01:44:54,909
It is said that the golden
flower matches the silvery one
and the pumpkin matches the cushaw

973
01:44:55,380 --> 01:44:58,539
Both of us are illiterate
and it's just

974
01:45:01,119 --> 01:45:02,449
Qiaozhen

975
01:45:02,489 --> 01:45:05,079
I have so much strength
and a flexible mind.

976
01:45:05,130 --> 01:45:09,029
I won't let you suffer even
if I have to work as an animal

977
01:45:11,170 --> 01:45:14,600
I will make you enjoy all
the happiness a villager can afford

978
01:45:27,520 --> 01:45:30,010
Mum, ask my father to tell Mashuan

979
01:45:30,250 --> 01:45:32,439
that our wedding will be held according
to the local customs completely

980
01:45:33,460 --> 01:45:37,020
It should be the same as yours
at that time

981
01:45:37,229 --> 01:45:39,020
It's of old times

982
01:45:39,699 --> 01:45:41,890
That's also Ok

983
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:20,189
Come on! Eat sugar

984
01:46:21,270 --> 01:46:25,130
Here are the dishes!

985
01:46:37,819 --> 01:46:39,649
The dishes are coming!

986
01:46:42,220 --> 01:46:46,119
Hi. Attention please!...

987
01:46:46,159 --> 01:46:48,680
Give me a way!

988
01:46:48,729 --> 01:46:49,850
Hey, the dishes come again.

989
01:46:51,029 --> 01:46:52,460
Cheers! cheers!

990
01:46:52,500 --> 01:46:56,630
Hey, eat first

991
01:46:57,210 --> 01:47:00,640
Enjoy yourself, take easy! Hehe...

992
01:47:00,680 --> 01:47:02,470
Come on! Come on!

993
01:47:02,510 --> 01:47:03,699
Cheers!

994
01:47:06,079 --> 01:47:07,300
Hey, put it over there

995
01:47:07,350 --> 01:47:09,609
Here are the dishes!

996
01:47:11,220 --> 01:47:12,939
Hey. Here come the dishes!

997
01:47:12,989 --> 01:47:14,979
No Help yourselves, please!

998
01:47:15,020 --> 01:47:18,310
Give me a way!
Hey, the dishes are coming!

999
01:47:34,180 --> 01:47:37,039
Go away quickly please. Quickly, please!

1000
01:47:37,079 --> 01:47:38,340
Go away please!

1001
01:47:39,109 --> 01:47:42,130
Go out quickly please!
Go out! How disgusting!

1002
01:48:09,409 --> 01:48:10,770
My second elder sister!

1003
01:48:31,069 --> 01:48:32,970
My dear little sister

1004
01:48:34,670 --> 01:48:36,500
don't forget me

1005
01:48:39,270 --> 01:48:41,199
You must come to see me frequently

1006
01:48:44,649 --> 01:48:46,609
I'm illiterate

1007
01:48:49,279 --> 01:48:51,939
but you like learned people

1008
01:48:52,949 --> 01:48:54,640
Elderly sister

1009
01:48:58,930 --> 01:49:03,020
I see, you are suffering in your heart

1010
01:49:06,939 --> 01:49:12,930
At any rate, I have to live my life

1011
01:49:13,739 --> 01:49:17,359
Elderly sister, don't take it so seriously

1012
01:49:18,210 --> 01:49:22,109
There are so many things
worth loving in one's life

1013
01:49:22,680 --> 01:49:26,630
Don't get dismayed for one thing

1014
01:49:27,189 --> 01:49:28,850
Elderly sister

1015
01:49:33,399 --> 01:49:34,989
You must come to see me frequently

1016
01:49:35,029 --> 01:49:36,289
Yeah

1017
01:49:36,869 --> 01:49:38,960
You should always speak these words to me

1018
01:49:40,840 --> 01:49:42,890
Elderly sister

1019
01:51:19,170 --> 01:51:20,859
Now we can proceed ahead

1020
01:51:23,069 --> 01:51:25,359
Proceed ahead, let's walk up front

1021
01:51:25,609 --> 01:51:27,100
Hey, the rear catch up

1022
01:53:58,329 --> 01:54:01,119
Nannan
GaoJialin will be finished

1023
01:54:02,359 --> 01:54:04,449
The regional
investigation group have come to

1024
01:54:04,500 --> 01:54:06,789
investigate how he had ever
found the job through the backdoor

1025
01:54:06,840 --> 01:54:08,699
I wrote to disclose him

1026
01:54:09,670 --> 01:54:12,239
I wrote to disclose him

1027
01:54:12,239 --> 01:54:14,140
And now we are villains

1028
01:54:15,140 --> 01:54:16,970
You good-for-nothing
how silly you are to

1029
01:54:17,010 --> 01:54:20,069
speak these damn words with your
lover being induced by him?

1030
01:54:23,119 --> 01:54:26,109
Moreover, it's really illegal for him
to get in by the back door

1031
01:54:26,149 --> 01:54:27,560
to get in by the back door

1032
01:54:27,560 --> 01:54:29,149
have the duty to maintain
the laws of our party

1033
01:54:29,189 --> 01:54:32,710
Mum, you are right in principle

1034
01:54:32,989 --> 01:54:37,510
But morally , we are revenging him
in the name of public interests

1035
01:54:37,829 --> 01:54:39,159
Fuck your nonsense!

1036
01:54:40,670 --> 01:54:43,069
Sanxing, Sanxing

1037
01:54:48,140 --> 01:54:48,899
Do you finish the training course?

1038
01:54:48,979 --> 01:54:49,840
Yeah

1039
01:54:52,109 --> 01:54:54,069
Are you going back
to Gaojiagou in these days?

1040
01:54:54,119 --> 01:54:57,810
No. I am carrying
the sands in Zhangjia River

1041
01:54:58,689 --> 01:55:01,380
Well. That's just the same

1042
01:55:01,859 --> 01:55:08,590
Do you know that Qiaozhen got married?

1043
01:55:12,869 --> 01:55:14,090
To whom?

1044
01:55:16,399 --> 01:55:17,380
Mashuan

1045
01:55:33,920 --> 01:55:36,850
Ma Zhansheng
is also dismissed from his post

1046
01:57:47,960 --> 01:57:50,819
No, I must be with you

1047
01:57:51,329 --> 01:57:53,020
It's impossible

1048
01:57:53,260 --> 01:57:54,810
for lam a peasant again now

1049
01:57:55,930 --> 01:57:57,770
I won't go to Nanjing

1050
01:57:57,770 --> 01:57:59,390
I won't go to Nanjing

1051
01:57:59,600 --> 01:58:01,260
I want to be a peasant together with you

1052
01:58:01,300 --> 01:58:03,590
I, I love you!

1053
01:58:04,340 --> 01:58:06,390
I won't live without you

1054
01:58:07,539 --> 01:58:11,899
Yaping, you needn't sacrifice
your own interests for me

1055
01:58:14,180 --> 01:58:17,939
I know your devoted love for me

1056
01:58:18,949 --> 01:58:20,779
I appreciate you very much

1057
01:58:22,920 --> 01:58:26,779
However, in my heart

1058
01:58:28,060 --> 01:58:29,609
I like Qiaozhen

1059
01:58:34,069 --> 01:58:35,789
more though she is illiterate

1060
01:59:01,229 --> 01:59:06,060
If, if that's the truth

1061
01:59:09,840 --> 01:59:14,399
I wish you happiness!

1062
01:59:19,949 --> 01:59:22,310
But Qiaozhen

1063
01:59:22,720 --> 01:59:25,810
has got married with another man

1064
02:00:43,060 --> 02:00:44,390
Elder sister

1065
02:00:51,939 --> 02:00:53,600
Elder sister, go back please!

1066
02:00:53,840 --> 02:00:56,359
Don't do that! That's laughable

1067
02:00:56,409 --> 02:00:57,369
To laugh at what?

1068
02:00:57,680 --> 02:00:59,939
Qiaoling told me all
this matter this morning

1069
02:01:00,350 --> 02:01:01,609
You don't

1070
02:01:02,619 --> 02:01:04,520
What a torturing person you are!

1071
02:01:06,590 --> 02:01:08,640
GaoJialin not only hurts you

1072
02:01:08,720 --> 02:01:12,479
but also embarrasses all our family

1073
02:01:13,329 --> 02:01:15,289
If you can stand this
you bear it yourself

1074
02:01:15,899 --> 02:01:18,229
Today I must embarrass
that guy in return

1075
02:01:23,640 --> 02:01:27,939
My good elder sister
he is so miserable now

1076
02:01:28,880 --> 02:01:30,710
If everyone hits a him when he's down

1077
02:01:31,510 --> 02:01:33,739
how can he live the following days?

1078
02:01:33,779 --> 02:01:35,210
I don't care

Don't treat Jialin like that

1081
02:02:07,779 --> 02:02:12,539
At any rate I love him

1082
02:02:15,989 --> 02:02:18,010
If you punish him like this

1083
02:02:19,130 --> 02:02:21,489
you are just poking my heart with a knife!

1084
02:02:26,529 --> 02:02:29,760
You, my dear sister

02:02:43,619 --> 02:02:54,960
which has many turns and twists

1087
02:03:12,649 --> 02:03:20,210
The ducks upriver
and the goose downriver

1088
02:03:20,250 --> 02:03:27,520
are focusing their eyes on their brothers
