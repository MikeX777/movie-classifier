26
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:37,329

00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,531
             CONNOR:
             <i> Hey.</i>

28
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,434
 Hey, you.
 What's all the noise?

29
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:44,336
       Oh, I just invited
       a few guys over.

30
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:47,840
             You know how it is.
             Word got out.
             I miss you.

31
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,341
  I miss you too.

32
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:52,044
But I'm saving
a lot towards school.

33
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:53,812
<i>So who's all there?</i>

34
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,915
Just Lucas, Mya,
and a few other people.

35
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:59,118
   I'd better go,
   but I love you.

00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:02,888
   I love you too.

38
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:08,227
      So when does the wife
      get back, huh?

39
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:11,663
The end of the month,
right before school starts.

40
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:14,600
- That's a long time to go
without gettin' something, bro.
- Nah.

41
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:17,536
       - Whoa, whoa, whoa!
       - Easy.

42
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:22,107
           The host of the party
           should always be
           one drink behind.

43
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:27,779
That was nice.
 ( chuckling )

44
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:30,649
             So, uh, who
             invited the skank?

45
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,353
            Uh, I don't even
            know who that is.
            Lucas friended her.

46
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,787
You are such
an Internet slut.

47
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:38,390
            Oh, come on, Mya.
            Give her a break.

48
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:41,193
She just moved here,
and she doesn't know anybody.
Look at her profile.

49
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:43,428
     - MYA: Yeah, no thanks.
     - Uh, we're almost
     out of beer.

50
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,898
      - I'll be right back.
      - Okay.

51
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:58,043
               ( chuckling )

52
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:05,784
        ( groans )

53
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:18,230
         - Need a hand?
         - I'm okay.

54
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:19,932
         Let me help you
         with that.

55
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:26,205
    ( chuckles )

56
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:30,976
   That's a nice Mercedes.

57
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:34,913
  You know, I've always
  wondered what these things
  look like on the inside.

58
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:37,883
           ( giggles )
           Can I?

59
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:39,885
                    Yeah.

60
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:46,491
        Come here.

61
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:49,761
( groans )

62
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:51,496
     God, look at this dash.

63
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:54,900
        - What do all
        these buttons do?
        - What?

64
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:59,238
    Come in. I want you to
     show me what they do.

65
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:02,307
      - Stop it. Come here.
      You silly.
      - ( chuckling )

66
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:05,410
   Oh, man, that beer bong
   is hitting me hard.

67
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:11,216
           ( groans )

68
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:13,218

00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,020
     ( groaning )

70
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:17,589
Now I know
why you shouldn't
drink and drive.

71
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,424
    - Everything's spinning.
    - ( chuckles )

72
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:21,426
                 I can make it
                stop spinning.

73
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:32,104
     - What are you doing?
     - Shh, shh, shh. Relax.

74
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:34,006
No tensing, remember?

75
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:48,487
          We shouldn't do this.

Hey, did you get
your new schedule yet?

   - First period, Mrs. Wolk.
   - Awesome.

So I get to see you
first thing every morning.

87

Unless your parents
let me sleep over.

88

    That is never
    going to happen.

89
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:52,050
Why? We've been together
for, like, two years.

90
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:54,986
   - I'm practically family.
  - What about your parents?

91
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:57,222
My parents are still
barely talking to me.

92
00:05:57,323 --> 00:06:00,158
    Do you blame them?
    I mean, you trashed
    their house with that party.

93
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:03,028
I didn't plan it.
And I swear that's never
gonna happen again,

94
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:04,963
  ever.

95
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:06,231

                Uh, who's that?

00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:13,905
Uh, just some new chick
Lucas friended.

99
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:16,241
       You know how he is.

100
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:17,909
    You gonna go in?

101
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,678
                    Okay.

                      All right,
                      everyone.

103
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:24,182

00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:29,087
               a fantastic
               summer vacation,

106
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:30,856
relaxed, because
it's all over,

107
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:32,858
and the work is
really about to begin

108
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:36,561
because this is the year
that counts, right?

109
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:38,830
So, get out your
world history books.

110
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:40,899

                  did she go to?

00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:02,053
              Doesn't say.

116
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:05,190
    Oh, look, and other than
    my dumb-ass boyfriend,

117

    it looks like she doesn't
    have very many friends.

 What the hell is that?

119
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:12,497
 Is that from the party?

120
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,433
Mm. Probably.

121
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:16,635
But, look, Connor
was so wasted,

122
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:19,738
he probably doesn't
even remember this photo.

123
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:21,473
Seriously, you have
nothing to worry about.

124

      Yeah, it's just,
      I'm late.

       "Late"?

126
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,080
     - Oh, you mean your...
     - Yeah.

127
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:31,750
      I was supposed to get
      my period over a week ago.

128

     - Have you told Connor?
     - What? No.

129
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,022
      And totally freak him out?
      Absolutely not. No way.

         I got to go.

132
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:43,929
         Okay. Well,
         call me, okay?

         I just don't understand
         why it has to happen.

138
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:00,278
          It doesn't mean
          anything's wrong.

139
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,016
       - Uh...
       - What's going on?

140
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:07,719
       Um, your sister had
      another miscarriage.

  Oh, Kel,
  I am so sorry.

00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:13,792
              Yeah, well,
              I should be
              used to it by now.

143
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:17,295
        - Um, are you in
        for the night?
        - Yeah.

144
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:19,798
           Okay. Look,

145
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:23,702
I really hate to do this,
but I have to go to work, okay?

146
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:26,104
      Um, your dad will be
      home later, okay?

147
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,339
              ( kisses )
              I love you.

148
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,975
                I love you too.

149
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:32,911
             You know what?
             It's gonna happen.

150
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,746
                  Thanks, Mom.

151
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,882
                   I know it.

152
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:38,817
  Bye, guys.

153
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:45,123
( door shuts )

154
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:48,126
  Greg and I swore
  if the last one didn't take,
  we'd try in vitro.

155
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:50,095
           What does that mean?

156
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:52,831
It means I get to be
poked and basted
like a turkey.

157
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:57,202
  ( chuckles )

158
00:08:57,303 --> 00:09:00,038
I just think it's funny
how in sex ed
they always warn you,

159
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:03,208
"Don't have unprotected sex.
You're sure to get pregnant."

160
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:04,943
And then when
you want to, you can't.

161
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,112
                   Yeah.

162
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,014
   And how are you?

163
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:10,715
  Everything okay
  with you and Connor?

164
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:12,851
                   Yeah.

165
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:14,753
            Yeah,
            everything's great.

166
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:16,888
     Are you sure?

167
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,225
            Yeah, I don't know.
            I just think

168
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:22,227
         maybe I shouldn't have
         left all summer.

169
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,243
    Headin' out.

170
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:46,418

171
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:49,220
    - MAN: Hey, you in there?
    - ( water rushes )

172
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:52,190
Hey, you hear me?

173
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,893
                  Yeah, Dad.
                   Whatever.

174
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,430
( door slams )

178
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:22,721
        - AMANDA:
        Hey, Mrs. Walker.
        - Hey.

179
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,823
      - It's really good to
      see you back, Amanda.
      - Thank you.

180
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:27,459
       - How was
       the counseling job?
       - It was good.

181
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,794
     - I made a lot of money
     for school, so...
     - Well, that's good.

182
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:31,963
        Well, I'm not gonna lie.
         I wish you'd been here,

183
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:34,799
    'cause then maybe my son
    wouldn't have been so stupid
    as to have a party.

184
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,402
Mom, are you ever
gonna forgive me
for that, for real?

185
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,437
              Maybe, if I can
              get that stain
              out of my carpet.

186
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:41,940
                  Get back to
                  your homework.

187
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,980
      - Come here.
      - ( squeals, laughs )

188
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:51,716
     - What are you doing?
     - Making up for summer.

189
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,653
( phone buzzes, beeps )

190
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,088

Nothing,

        - ( sighs ) Okay.

         You go deal with that,

204
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:48,273
  - How do you know it's mine?
  - Because I do.

205
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:51,242
             No, there's no way.
             I mean, it was,
             like, one time.

206
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,811
I haven't been
with anybody else.

207
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,747
I just moved here,
like, two months ago.

208
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:58,650
I don't know anybody.
Except you.

209
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:02,987
                So what do you
                want to do?

210
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:06,191
        I mean, it's not like
        this was planned.
        And I have a girlfriend.

211
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:10,061
Well, you should've
thought about that
before you slept with me.

212
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:13,398
         - I barely even
     remember what happened.
        - ( door opens )

213
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:15,834
MAN:
Hey, you guys,
let's get to class, okay?

214
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:21,372
 I'm keeping it.

215
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,274
    Our baby.

216

( bell ringing )

217
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:32,751
  Connor! Hey!

218
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:36,121
Hey! Where were you
this morning?

219
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:38,757
         - Uh, I wasn't
         feeling well.
         - Oh.

220
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:40,625
Well, did you hear about
 that new girl, Heather?

221
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,694
Apparently, she posted
a selfie of her positive
pregnancy test.

222
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:45,296
   I mean,
   that's crazy, right?

223
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:47,098
     If she were
     actually pregnant?

224
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:49,467
                    Yeah.

225
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:53,471
     You know what?
     I'm just gonna go home.
     But I'll talk to you later.

226
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:02,213
( cell phone rings )

227
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:05,817
  Hey.

MYA:
<i>Yo, have you seen</i>
<i>Heather's Face page?</i>

229
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:10,088
Yeah, she posted
her pee stick.

230
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:12,390
<i>No, there's more, Amanda.</i>
<i>Look at it.</i>

231
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:27,872
<i>Are you looking?</i>

232
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,074
 Yeah, I got to go.

                 ( chuckling )
                 Oh!

234
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,318
                I've picked you
                a good daddy.

236
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:48,426
                Shouldn't you be
                at work?

237
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:51,429
           Seriously?

238
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,832
    - Are you picking up
    where your mama left off?
    - Yeah.

239
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:55,633
                 Looks like it.

240
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:58,169
         Oh, and just like her,

241
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,138
             I'll be out of here
             soon enough.

    Why didn't you

      - What? Avoiding me?

247

          Hey, Connor.

248
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:52,757
     Hey, I got
     the blood results back.
     I'm for-sure pregnant.

              Look, Amanda,
              I have no idea
              what's going on.

251
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:59,030
You obviously slept with her.
Or is she just lying?

252
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:01,032
        - I'm not lying.
        - Shut up.

253
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,067
         Look, I'm not
         the one who cheated
         on his girlfriend.

254
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:04,903
           I didn't even know
           he had a girlfriend.

255
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:08,373
            Amanda, can we just
            talk about this?

256
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:11,609
No, you have no idea
how bad you just screwed up.

I can't believe this!

260
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:39,871
  How could he?

261
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:43,741
             I-I know, but maybe
             it's not as bad
             as it seems.

262
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:46,244
             I mean, people make
             mistakes, right?

263

00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:58,516
               Especially what
               it's done to you.

281
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,286
                      To us.

282
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:06,290
There is no more "us,"
Connor.

283
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:08,626
You took care of that
the night that you
got her pregnant.

284
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:12,330
     <i> ♪ You just disappear ♪</i>

285
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,643
            You should eat,
            sweetie.

286
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:27,412
            You look pale.

287
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:29,180
                      I'm fine.

288
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,488
( bell ringing )

289
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:39,791
          ( retching )

290
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:47,365
        ( phone ringing )

291
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:52,270
CONNOR:
I'm not gonna
stop texting

292
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:55,106
or calling you,
Amanda.

293
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:56,507
    Okay, I know we can
    get through this.

294
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:58,709
       Mr. Walker,
       is there a problem?

295
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:00,845
               Yes, Mrs. Wolk,
               there is.

296
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:03,848
           In fact, can I switch
           seats, please?

297
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:06,317
    - I'll switch with her.
    - ( students exclaiming )

298
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:10,655
      All right, all right.
      Amanda, Heather,
      switch seats.

299
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,024
     But if I have
     any more disturbances,
     I'm gonna move you all.

300
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,926
            "Ooh!"

301
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:16,961
               She's all yours.

302
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:19,564
      Amanda...

303
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:48,559
      - Have you talked to
      your parents yet?
      - No.

304
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:51,529
   - Why not?
   I'm already eight weeks.
   - Because they'll kill me.

305
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,731
Look, they'll get over it.
And then they'll meet
their grandchild,

306
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,200
       and they'll be so happy,
       just like we'll be.

307
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:59,470
    Have you told
    your parents?

308
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:01,172
           My mom's not around.

309
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:03,174
          She walked out on us,
          like, four years ago.

310
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:07,078
 I'm sorry.
 I didn't know that.

311
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:10,148
             And my dad...
             he doesn't care
             what I do.

312
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:12,450
   And even if I did tell him,
   he wouldn't help out.

313
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:14,452
          He wouldn't buy me
          any maternity clothes,

314
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:16,554
              so what am I
              supposed to wear?

315
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:19,490
      I can't even see a doctor
      because we don't
      have insurance.

316
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:21,692
              And I sure as hell
              can't afford it
              on my own.

317
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:23,728
               And I didn't want
               to say anything,

318
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:25,396
         but I'm really worried
         about this baby.

319
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:28,266
               I'm trying to do
               everything right,

320
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,034
             but I have no one.

321
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:33,004
                No one is there
                to help me.

322
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:35,940
Look, I'll take care
of it, okay?

323
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:39,110
I have some money saved up.
You can use it for a doctor

324
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,112
 so you and the baby
can get checked out.

325
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:44,282
Oh, thanks! I knew
you'd take care of us!

326
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:05,102
                 ( sniffling )

327
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:18,683
            Hey, Mom.
            Hey, Dad.

328
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:21,819
               Hey, sweetie.

329
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,854
  Hey.

330
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:25,990
                What?

331
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,626
Is there something
you want to tell us?

332
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,762
       - No. Why?
       - Oh, I don't know.

333
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:35,399
Maybe the fact that you
don't eat a lot these days,

334
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,070
you don't sleep very much,
you cry a lot.

335
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:41,572
               I'm okay.
               I just have been
               really busy.

336
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:43,407
               A little tired,
               is all.

337
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:47,245
( drawer opens )

338
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,156
            I thought we were
            being safe. I swear.

339
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:01,158
             I didn't mean
             for this to happen.

340
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,927
Amanda,
do you have any idea

341
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:05,863
what this is gonna
do to your life,
to your future?

342
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,164
You're only 17.

343
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,900
You haven't even
finished high school.

344
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:12,970
And what about college?
Or did you just forget
about that?

345
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:15,539
               I didn't do this
               on purpose.

346
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:18,776
               I don't even know
              what I'm gonna do.

347
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:21,679
           I mean, Mom's right.

348
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,115
          If I keep the baby,
          it changes everything.

349
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:26,317
                No, no,
                wait a second.

350
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:28,986
       I did not mean to suggest
       that you shouldn't
       have this baby.

351
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:30,888
            But you did make
            a mistake, Amanda.

352
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:33,924
      Look, you do need to take
      some responsibility here.

353
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:36,994
She obviously can't
go to school and raise
the baby at the same time.

354
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:38,929
             Okay.
             No, she cannot.

355
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:41,532
           But she also has
           her parents.

356
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,467
                  Right?

357
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:45,603
               You have both
           of your parents here
               to help you.

358
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:48,439
 Do you know

359
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:50,341
that when I was 19,

360
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:54,745
your father and I had
to make the exact
same decision?

361
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:57,315
And do you know
how grateful I am

362
00:21:57,382 --> 00:22:01,385
every single day
that I get to look into
your sister's smiling face...

363
00:22:03,355 --> 00:22:05,456
         and yours.

364
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,693
                      Dad?

365
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:11,429
( exhales sharply )

366
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:14,298
Obviously,
this is not what
I wanted, Amanda.

367
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:19,270
But your mother's right.

368
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:22,506
 Come here.

369
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:34,885
             Look, I'm sure
             that you and Connor
             are terrified,

370
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:36,887
       but just know that
       we will be there for you,

371
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:38,756
          and we will get
          through this together.

372
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:42,126
           Connor doesn't know.
            I haven't told him.

373
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,895
               Why? Amanda,
               this is his baby.

374
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:47,164
           He deserves to know.

375
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:50,000
                    He cheated
                    on me, Mom.

376
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:54,772
                   And she's
                   pregnant too.

377
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:00,878
          - What?
          - ( sobbing )

378
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:13,924
        Amanda,
        your father and I

379
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:16,360
have decided to
go over to Connor's
and talk to his parents.

380
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:20,197
    - Now?
    - And we would like
    for you to come with us.

381
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:22,466
You did talk to Connor, right?
Because his parents
didn't mention anything.

382
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:25,302
          Yeah. He just probably
          hasn't told them.

383
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:28,105
        Okay. You might want to
        give them a heads-up
        that we're coming.

384
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:30,007
        Okay.

385
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:37,148
                ( phone beeps )

386
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:39,683
( doorbell rings )

387
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:43,020
We had the greatest summer,
as I said, but we missed you.

388
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:45,589
- The vineyard was spectacular.
You have to come next time.
- FATHER: We'd love to.

389
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:49,026
And this pinot is phenomenal.
I mean, wait till you taste it.

390
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,929
    But anyway, enough about us.
    So, uh, how are things?

391
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:54,498
MOTHER:
Well, actually,
that's why we're here.

392
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:57,868
         Amanda and Connor have
         something they want to
         discuss with us.

393
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:00,805
  Oh, what is it?

394
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:05,276
                        Amanda.

395
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:08,946
                I'm pregnant.

396
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,716
       MR. WALKER:
       Unbelievable.

397
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:15,186
       Connor, you didn't think
       that maybe you should've
       told us?

398
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,855
I didn't know about it
until just before
they came over.

399
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:21,592
 tt?
      - AMANDA: It's true.

400
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:24,662
   - I don't understand this.
   Weren't you being safe?
   - Yeah, we were.

401
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:26,831
At least,
I thought we were.

402
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:28,732
   - Well, one of you wasn't.
   - MOTHER: Wait a second.

403
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,701
          In all fairness,
          even if they were
          taking precautions,

404
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:33,037
     we all know something
     like this can still happen.

405
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:36,574
Okay, okay, let's not
all get worked up
about this, okay?

406
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:39,543
I mean, there is
a way to handle this.

407
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:41,612
            Right?

408
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:45,583
        I'm keeping the baby,
        if that's what you mean.

409
00:24:50,388 --> 00:24:53,791
And there's more.

410
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:56,060
        There's a girl at school
        who's also claiming
        she's pregnant

411
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,128
       with Connor's baby.

412
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:02,833
           What is this, a joke?
           Is this some kind
           of damn joke?

413
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:05,336
         It's true.

414
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:08,005
Connor, I don't
understand any of it.

415
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:10,908
    - How could this happen?
    - I'll tell you how
    it could happen.

416
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:13,611
        This is some kind
        of sick game
        these girls are playing.

417
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:16,814
 Now, wait a second.
  It's your son who
screwed around here.

418
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:20,351
   - It does take two, Peter.
   - MRS. WALKER: Connor,
   I don't understand this.

419
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:22,686
Who is this girl?
What's her name?

420
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:25,656
   Her name's Heather.
   I don't even know her.
   I met her--

421
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:28,259
           Whoa, wait a second!

422
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,327
       What do you mean,
       you don't know her?
       It doesn't sound like it.

423
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:32,563
MRS. WALKER:
You know what?
What if you just calm down?

424
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:34,865
PETER:
You still think we shouldn't
have sent him to private school?

425
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:37,902
       - Away from these--
       - What, Peter?
       Away from what?

426
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:40,871
               Hey, look.
               My son's life
               is ruined, Jeff.

427
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:44,375
     - You know, this is not
       just about Connor.
     - Amanda, she's right.

428
00:25:44,442 --> 00:25:47,177
 I mean, have you thought
about this, what this means
 for both of your futures?

429
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,813
               Yes. I have.

430
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:52,249
      And I want to do
      what's right for the baby.

431
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:55,519
     What about this other girl?
     Is she gonna do
     the right thing?

432
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:58,055
     - Yeah.
     - PETER: That's great.

433
00:25:58,156 --> 00:26:00,424
           And guess who gets
           to pay for all of it.

434
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:02,560
     - Us, that's who.
     - JEFF: Really, Peter?

435
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:04,328
You know, I've had
enough of this.

436
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:07,665
      Come on, Amanda,
      let's go.

437
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:12,036
                   MOTHER:
                   You know,

438
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:14,705
 we will contribute as much
 as we possibly can.

439
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:17,508
But I thought that you
knew that about us already.

440
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:23,414
          Amanda, wait.

441
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:26,750
Why didn't you tell me?

442
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:28,619
           I was gonna tell you.
           You were too busy
           fondling Heather.

443
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,289
     - I don't want anything
     to with her.
     - Exactly, Connor.

444
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:35,559
           If it was just us,
           I could talk to you.

445
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,328
                But it's not.

446
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:39,430
     - Amanda, please...
     - MRS. WALKER: Connor.

447
00:26:42,867 --> 00:26:45,836
   Look, I don't care

448
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:48,138
what my parents say.

449
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:50,975
I'm gonna be here for you
whether you want me to or not.

450
00:26:57,515 --> 00:26:59,383
                 Come on.

         That's me.
         Thank you.

479
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,782
Mrs. Walker.
Mrs. Heather Walker.

480
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:40,617
( knock on door )

481
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:53,330
What do you want?

482
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,501
           That's no way to
           treat your boyfriend.

483
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:00,404
                  Your dad got
                  any beers?

484
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:03,407
     No.

485
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:05,242
   I said "no."

486
00:29:05,343 --> 00:29:07,311
And you're not staying.

487
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:10,347
         - Come here.
          - ( gasps )

488
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:12,249
               Come on.

489
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:15,652
             Dad's not home,

490
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,288
          you're looking great.

491
00:29:18,356 --> 00:29:21,558
       It's been a month since
       I've been in your pants.
       You know that?

492
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:24,595
I don't want to see you
anymore, Trent.

493
00:29:24,662 --> 00:29:26,530
Why do you think
I haven't called?

494
00:29:26,631 --> 00:29:28,565
                     What,

495
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:31,068
             you got some new,
             rich boyfriend?

496
00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:34,004
  Seeing as the last time
  you tried to swindle somebody,

497
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,572
             it didn't work out
             so good.

498
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,408
 We're done, Trent.

499
00:29:38,476 --> 00:29:41,512
        I'm getting tired of
        of getting jerked around
        by you

500
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:44,915
            every time
            one of your plans
            doesn't work out.

501
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:04,034
            - Hey.
            - Hey.

502
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,937
I just thought you
should know that this
isn't the first time

503
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:08,772
       - that Heather
       has done this.
       - What do you mean?

504
00:30:08,873 --> 00:30:10,974
     - She's faking, Connor.
     - Faking what?

505
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:15,212
       - You know what
       I'm talking about.
       - No. No, I don't.

506
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,981
               What do you want,
               Heather? Money?

507
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:21,552
            The attention?
            Or are you just some
            pathological liar?

508
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,987
  - Hey, come on, Amanda,
  just forget it.
  - No, you're lying, Heather.

509
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:27,357
       You're not pregnant.
       Just like you lied
       at your last high school.

510
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:29,860
              Burkin High.
              I mean, seriously,

511
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:32,429
             how long did you
             think you could
             get away with this?

512
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:34,731
            I bet you're lying
            to me about Connor
            sleeping with you.

513
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,467
 Oh, trust me,
 I did not make that up.

514
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:40,737
You're just jealous
because I'm having
your boyfriend's baby.

515
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,073
Or is it "ex-boyfriend"?

516
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:45,242
           Oh, I have nothing
           to be jealous about,

517
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,411
              because
              I'm pregnant too.

518
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:50,414
Bet that wasn't part
of your twisted plan,
was it?

519
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:52,683
        Connor was so drunk
        at that party, he barely
        remembers anything.

520
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,718
              For all he knows,
              you're making
              everything up.

521
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:56,787
You just can't
deal with the fact

522
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:59,489
that your boyfriend
cheated on you, can you?

523
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:01,391
Let me paint a little
picture for you:

524
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:04,561
me and Connor
in the front seat
of his daddy's Mercedes.

525
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:06,163
          - Amanda...
          - Just don't!

526
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:09,099
You know, the one
  with the soft
leather interior

527
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,668
with me on top
and your boyfriend
underneath me.

528
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:13,503
         - You're lying!
         - ( clamoring )

529
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:17,007
      - Oh! Connor!
      - Whoa, whoa.
      What's going on here?

530
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:19,376
( groans )
Amanda, she pushed me!

531
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:21,745
        - Oh, my God!
        - Back to class!

532
00:31:21,846 --> 00:31:24,181
    - Back to class!
    - ( coughing, groaning )

533
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:26,283
           Okay. All right.

534
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:29,386
( gasping, groaning )

535
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:32,623
MRS. WOLK:
Call 911.
It's okay. Breathe.

536
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:35,459
I just can't believe
she would do that, Connor.

537
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,761
She could've hurt
our baby.

538
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:40,697
 I mean, what about when
the baby actually comes?

539
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:42,866
I'm just afraid of
what she might do.

540
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:44,968
               She wouldn't hurt
              the baby, Heather.

541
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:47,804
I'm in the hospital,
Connor,

542
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,806
because of her.

543
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,909
             Look, I'm not gonna
            let anything happen.

544
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:54,811
                    All right?

545
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,480
        - Mom.
        - What happened?

546
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,516
        Nothing.
        The baby's fine.

547
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:02,052
  Nothing's fine.
  Amanda pushed me.

548
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:04,554
                I take it
                you're Heather.

549
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:06,556
              Connor, will you
              make sure I don't

550
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:08,759
   get a ticket where I'm parked
   in front of the entrance?

551
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:18,135
             So, you're the one

552
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:20,871
         planning to be carrying
         my son's baby.

553
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:22,973
I am carrying
your son's baby.

554
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:26,410
        - Have you had
        a paternity test?
        - No.

555
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:28,345
I won't endanger
my baby.

556
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:30,514
Besides, Connor knows
I haven't been with
anyone else.

557
00:32:30,581 --> 00:32:33,617
  ( chuckles )
  Connor knows you haven't
  been with anyone else. Sure.

558
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:35,686
               Connor doesn't
               know anything,

559
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,322
             but I have
             a pretty good idea

560
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:40,190
                  of what you're
                  all about.

561
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:42,926
              Just so you know.

562
00:32:42,994 --> 00:32:45,929
        Oh, and don't sweat it.
        It's just a blood test.

563
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,867
You can't make me
do it.

564
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,337
          We'll see about that.

565
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:01,244
           ( ringing )

566
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:03,313
             Hey.

567
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:06,083
          Hey. How is everything
          with Heather?

568
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:09,920
       <i> Uh, the doctor said</i>
       <i> she and the baby</i>
       <i> should be fine.</i>

569
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:12,055
            Look, I didn't mean
            to hurt her.

570
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:15,025
           <i> I just...</i>
           <i> I'm sorry.</i>

571
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:17,561
     Amanda, I get that
     this is my mess,

572
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:19,930
   <i> okay, but we're all</i>
   <i> just going to have to</i>
   <i> try to get along.</i>

573
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:22,733
       I'm not gonna be friends
          with her, if that's
        what you think, Connor.

574
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,434
          <i> I get that.</i>

575
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:27,471
      <i> So just leave her alone.</i>
      <i> All right?</i>

576
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:28,839
                    Fine.

577
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,041
                I'll do that.

578
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:39,683
  - Are you kidding me?
  - Kelly, it is hard enough
  on your sister without you--

579
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:42,619
        She can't have a baby.
        She's not even married.

580
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:45,522
Or do you and your
high-school sweetheart Connor
plan on getting hitched?

581
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:47,791
     - You know what, Kelly?
     That is enough.
     - No, I mean it.

582
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:51,795
How do they plan on raising
a baby between home room
and soccer practice?

583
00:33:54,732 --> 00:33:58,268
        You know, if there was
        ever a time that Amanda
        needed a big sister,

584
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,170
           now would be it.

585
00:34:00,271 --> 00:34:02,039
Wait, just...

586
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,740
    I'll go.

587
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:16,653
Look, I'm really sorry,
all right?

588
00:34:16,754 --> 00:34:19,523
          I've been trying for
          over a year, Amanda.

589
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:23,693
             I want a family
             more than anything
             in the world.

590
00:34:23,761 --> 00:34:26,663
         - And then you
         just go and...
         - I know.

591
00:34:26,764 --> 00:34:29,833
  It's not fair.

592
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:34,604
          Fair or not,
          I'm still your sister,

593
00:34:34,705 --> 00:34:36,706
                and I'm here
                for you, okay?

594
00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:40,177
                  I mean it.

595
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:57,828
                   ( chuckles )

596
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:01,064
             Oh! I know you'll
             take care of us.

597
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:06,503
          ( shutter clicking )

00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:16,746

   I would prefer to take
   Amanda home myself,

if that's okay
with you.

615
00:36:29,987 --> 00:36:31,955
  Of course.

00:36:32,056 --> 00:36:34,057

622
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,576
          unless it's hiding,
          it looks like you're
          going to have a girl.

623
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:55,412
             Really?

624
00:36:55,513 --> 00:36:57,047
       I'm having a girl?

625
00:36:57,114 --> 00:36:59,950

    paint your nursery pink.
    - ( laughs )

00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,985
And everything else
looks okay?

627
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:05,555
         Everything looks fine.
         Do you want to hear

        - Yes.

  Thank you, baby daddy.

635
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:33,750
            Oh, Connor's gonna
            love me in this.

636
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:39,122
   Ah!
   ( giggling )

637
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:41,391
        Hmm. ( giggling )

638
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:49,165
      - ( door opens )
      - You left your keys
      in the door again.

639
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:53,737
                   Seriously?
                  You got to be
                   kidding me.

                 Jeez...

641
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:58,708
It's not
your problem, Dad.

642
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:01,011
        Yeah, you're damn right
        that ain't my problem.

643
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:03,647
Well, I wouldn't expect
anything to change now.

644
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:06,850
        Well, I hope you got it
        all figured out, then.

645
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,685
Of course I do.

646
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:09,986
             - Yeah?
             - Yeah.

647
00:38:10,087 --> 00:38:12,622
I'm not that much
like Mom. I was smart.

648
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:14,891
    - I didn't pick a loser.
    - Hmm.

649
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:17,661
             Well, he must be
             some kind of
             lucky boy, then.

650
00:38:17,728 --> 00:38:21,164
          Don't lose them again.
          Clean all that up.

00:38:25,736 --> 00:38:27,604

00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:29,906
CONNOR:
That's incredible.

653
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:32,442
       - It's like in 3-D
       and everything.
       - ( chuckles )

654
00:38:32,543 --> 00:38:35,211
     - You can clean up now.
     - Okay.

655
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,747
( phone ringing )

656
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,787
              I heard your mom
             was making her take
              a paternity test.

657
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:48,158
  Yeah. We should hear back
  from the lab today.

658
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:50,260
      She's driving me
      crazy, Amanda,

659
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:53,396
calling and texting
all the time,
needing stuff.

660
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:56,466
And when I talked to you
that day at the hospital,
I was stressed out.

661
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:59,536
Okay? She got me thinking
something bad could've
happened to the baby,

662
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:01,638
and just didn't want
to deal with any more drama.

663
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:03,573
But I never meant
to push you away.

664
00:39:05,209 --> 00:39:07,243
         ( phone beeps )

665
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:11,047
           ( beeping )

666
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:13,049
See what I mean?

667
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:15,185
        - Well, is
        everything okay?
        - Yeah.

668
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:17,821
   I'll just tell her
   I'm at your ultrasound.

669
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:20,056
I mean, she's got to understand
that it's not just about her.

670
00:39:20,157 --> 00:39:22,292
Besides,

671
00:39:22,393 --> 00:39:25,428
     I want to be here...
     with you.

672
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:30,033
Connor, hi, this is me.
I need you to call me right now.

673
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:33,603
   I don't know why you're not
   answering your phone.
   Please call me.

674
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:36,573
Connor, hi, this is me.
I need you to call me back.

675
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,409
   Baby, I'm sorry, I need you
   to call me back right now.
   This is really important.

676
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,711
Please, you have to
call me back right now, okay?

677
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:46,983
        - ( phone beeps )
        - ( sighs )

678
00:40:08,472 --> 00:40:11,174
That bitch!

679
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:16,746
                ( coughs )

680
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:24,354
So has Heather been
to her ultrasound?

681
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:26,589
          Not yet, but I'm sure
          she'll let me know,

682
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:30,126
            seeing as my parents
            have to pay for it.
            ( laughs )

683
00:40:30,227 --> 00:40:32,695
Thanks for letting me
be there today.

684
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:41,137
      ( phone beeps )

685
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:47,677
       - Is it her again?
       - Yeah.

686
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:51,114
     She says she's taken
     some pill to calm her down,
     and now she feels sick.

687
00:40:51,215 --> 00:40:53,049
 Better go.

688
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:54,918
Amanda, she doesn't
have anyone else.

689
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:57,854
                  I get it. Go.

690
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:59,956
                     I'm sorry.

691
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:11,835
CONNOR:
All right,
I'll tell her. Thanks.

692
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:14,103
   So the doctor said
   you and the baby
   should be fine,

693
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:17,106
but to never take
any medication again
until you talk to him first.

694
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:19,509
           I'm sorry, Connor.

695
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:21,611
       It's okay.

696
00:41:23,013 --> 00:41:25,882
You need anything?

697
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:28,718
           I'd love something
           to drink.

698
00:41:33,557 --> 00:41:35,825
                ( sighs )

699
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:39,329
( buzzes, beeps )

700
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:56,613
( refrigerator door shuts )

701
00:42:04,488 --> 00:42:07,257
          ( shudders, sobs )

702
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:09,959
( door shuts )

703
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:14,430
            - Here.
            - Thanks.

704
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:22,138
     - So, where's the baby
         going to sleep?
     - My room. Want to see?

705
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:28,177
   I was thinking maybe
   I could put the baby bed
   right here next to mine.

706
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:30,313
I want to fix it up
a little bit.

707
00:42:30,414 --> 00:42:33,116
And some new furniture
and curtains

708
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:36,352
and a new heater
and maybe patch up some
of the holes on the wall.

709
00:42:36,453 --> 00:42:38,388
Do you think maybe
your parents could help out?

710
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:42,058
'Cause I'd really hate for
our baby to be sleeping
in here like it is.

711
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:44,127
             I'll talk to them.

712
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:47,263
    - Do you want to come in?
    - No, thanks.
    I'd better get going.

713
00:42:47,331 --> 00:42:49,499
Well, do you want to just
stay, just for a little bit?

714
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,801
'Cause it kind of gets
lonely here lately,

715
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:53,636
        and my dad's
        never around,

716
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:55,772
   and my mom hasn't called
   in over a year, so...

717
00:42:55,873 --> 00:42:58,274
    - ( vehicle approaches )
    - Sounds like
    your dad's home now.

718
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:00,877
    - We should talk to him.
    - Okay.

719
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:07,050
( vehicle door
opens, shuts )

720
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:13,590
FATHER:
Hey, kid.

721
00:43:13,691 --> 00:43:15,258
    Come here.

722
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:21,497
            Come on.

723
00:43:22,967 --> 00:43:25,702
                       Come on.

724
00:43:25,803 --> 00:43:27,870
               Are you the one?

725
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:29,906
      I'm sorry?

726
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:33,710
         The one who put my girl
         in her condition.
         Is that you?

727
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,114
That's what she says.

728
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:43,586
                You poor little
                son of a bitch.

729
00:43:43,687 --> 00:43:45,655
                  ( chuckling )

730
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:55,865
MOTHER:
Hey. Feel any better?

731
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:57,900
          - Not really.
          - You know,

732
00:43:58,002 --> 00:44:01,170
         when Connor called
         and said he wanted to
         go to the ultrasound,

733
00:44:01,271 --> 00:44:03,573
        he said he really wanted
        to be there for you.

734
00:44:03,674 --> 00:44:07,143
Yeah, well, he can't be
in two places at once, can he?

735
00:44:08,879 --> 00:44:12,115
           He loves you, Amanda,
           not her.

736
00:44:12,216 --> 00:44:14,384
           Try to remember that,
           okay?

737
00:44:27,564 --> 00:44:30,033
          <i> ( line ringing )</i>

738
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:32,168
      <i> Hey, it's me, Amanda.</i>
      <i> Leave me a message.</i>

739
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:34,070
           <i> ( beeps )</i>

740
00:44:35,472 --> 00:44:37,540
So I just got off
the phone with the lab.

741
00:44:39,543 --> 00:44:42,311
Heather's baby is yours.

742
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:55,191
Are you all right?

743
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:57,060
                   Yeah.

744
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:01,698
                   Look,

745
00:45:01,799 --> 00:45:04,867
            I was just over
            at her house, Mom.

746
00:45:04,968 --> 00:45:08,004
    It's a mess.
    She showed me where the baby
    was supposed to sleep,

747
00:45:08,105 --> 00:45:10,039
         and it was disgusting.

748
00:45:10,107 --> 00:45:13,910
           She asked if we could
           help fix it up.

749
00:45:13,977 --> 00:45:16,779
 - Now that we know
 the baby's mine--
 - So she wants money for this?

750
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,148
           She doesn't have any
           herself, Mom.

751
00:45:19,249 --> 00:45:20,850
 I'm well aware
 of that, Connor.

752
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:29,859
God, don't worry about it.
I'll take care of everything.

753
00:45:31,195 --> 00:45:33,429
           ( kisses )
           I'll take care of it.

754
00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:41,204
 social media that
   the baby's Connor's.

755
00:45:41,271 --> 00:45:43,272
          She even posted
          a picture of the test.

756
00:45:43,373 --> 00:45:45,708
                 Hey, I was
                 calling, and...

757
00:45:45,776 --> 00:45:49,612
    ( whispering ) I was calling
    and texting you all night.
    The results came back.

758
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,849
I heard. Is that why you went
and stayed at Heather's house?
To celebrate?

759
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:55,418
                 What are you
                 talking about?
                 I came home.

760
00:45:55,486 --> 00:45:57,353
Connor, you texted me
saying that you were
staying there.

761
00:45:57,454 --> 00:45:59,388
                  No, I didn't.

762
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,668
You can stop with
the stupid little
games, Heather.

763
00:46:12,736 --> 00:46:16,105
I mean, really. Texting me
that Connor stayed over?
Pathetic.

764
00:46:16,173 --> 00:46:18,407
               What's pathetic
               is you believing
               everything

765
00:46:18,475 --> 00:46:20,443
               Connor tells you,
               or doesn't.

766
00:46:20,544 --> 00:46:22,011
           In case you forget,

767
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:25,314
       he never told you that
       he slept with me before,

768
00:46:25,415 --> 00:46:28,284
        so why would he
        tell you the truth now?

      - Yeah. Who are you?

778
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:22,071
              I'm Diane Walker.

779
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:24,941
       My son is the father
       of your daughter's child.

780
00:47:25,042 --> 00:47:27,143
  Okay, I get it.

781
00:47:27,244 --> 00:47:29,545
          No, no, I don't think
          you do get it,
          Mr. Henderson.

782
00:47:29,646 --> 00:47:31,547
                You see, my son

783
00:47:31,615 --> 00:47:33,850
                has a very, very
                bright future,

784
00:47:33,951 --> 00:47:37,787
       and, well, quite frankly,
       a baby isn't part
       of his plan.

785
00:47:37,888 --> 00:47:40,022
Okay, so what
you're saying is that

786
00:47:40,123 --> 00:47:41,924
your son knocks up
my daughter,

787
00:47:41,992 --> 00:47:44,594
       - and now he ain't
       gonna step up?
       - I'm saying,

788
00:47:44,661 --> 00:47:46,629
                     my son made
                     a mistake,

789
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:50,566
          one which
          I'm pretty sure
          your daughter planned.

790
00:47:50,634 --> 00:47:52,401
                Which is
                why I'm here--

791
00:47:52,502 --> 00:47:54,136
                  to make good
                  on that plan.

792
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:56,405
               That should help
                raise the child

793
00:47:56,506 --> 00:47:59,208
              for the next seven
              or eight years,
              and after that,

794
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:01,310
         we can make other
         arrangements, but only

795
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:03,512
               if Heather stays
               away from my son.

796
00:48:03,614 --> 00:48:06,816
         - Are we clear?
         - Oh, yeah.

797
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:10,620
       Then if we have a deal,
       I need you to sign these.

798
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:22,331
Cool.

799
00:48:22,432 --> 00:48:24,000
               Wouldn't you like
               your copy?

800
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:33,876
You want to come inside
and have a drink or something?

801
00:48:38,215 --> 00:48:41,017
  Bein' neighborly.
  Ha!

802
00:48:41,118 --> 00:48:43,085
           MYA:
           <i> Hey, check this out.</i>

803
00:48:44,855 --> 00:48:46,489
I'm sure these will
piss Heather off,

804
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:49,959
since I bet nobody decided
to throw her a baby shower.

805
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:52,428
     - What?
     - It's not a game, Mya.

806
00:48:52,529 --> 00:48:54,697
   I know that.

807
00:48:54,798 --> 00:48:57,566
But she's playing like
it is, so you have to too.

808
00:48:57,634 --> 00:49:00,603
I mean, you believe
 she's the one who
texted you, right?

809
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:05,408
She's messing with you,
Amanda.

810
00:49:05,475 --> 00:49:07,743
Look, you've got to give
Connor a chance here.

811
00:49:07,844 --> 00:49:09,712
              He's been
              texting me today.

812
00:49:09,813 --> 00:49:12,014
              Wants to know
              if he can see me.

813
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:14,317
Then forget the crazy bitch
and go.

814
00:49:14,384 --> 00:49:16,185
    - ( phone beeps )
    - ( gasps ) Look at that.

815
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:19,355
 One "like" already.

816
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:21,524
  ( chuckles )

817
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:24,994
    I'm so not surprised
     we're having a boy.

818
00:49:25,062 --> 00:49:27,997
I mean, I've been
dreaming about this.

819
00:49:28,098 --> 00:49:30,166
You and me
taking him

820
00:49:30,267 --> 00:49:32,301
to his first
ball game.

821
00:49:32,402 --> 00:49:34,170
( giggling )
Oh, by the way,

822
00:49:34,271 --> 00:49:36,205
did you talk to your mom
about getting money
for the "renos"?

823
00:49:36,273 --> 00:49:38,240
           Yep. She said she'd
           help take care of it.

824
00:49:38,342 --> 00:49:40,242
    Good!

825
00:49:40,344 --> 00:49:42,311
     - You want to come in?
     - ( phone beeps )

826
00:49:42,412 --> 00:49:45,081
          Ah, I can't.
          I got to be somewhere.

827
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:48,517
( exclaims )
Fine!

828
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:17,913
             Dad?

829
00:50:31,828 --> 00:50:34,430
             ( phone beeps )

830
00:50:41,405 --> 00:50:43,672
          ( exclaims )

831
00:50:55,285 --> 00:50:59,321
          Look, I know
          things are really
          messed up right now,

832
00:50:59,423 --> 00:51:02,358
            and you have every
            reason to doubt me,

833
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:05,394
         but you got to know...

834
00:51:05,495 --> 00:51:07,830
                  it's you.

835
00:51:07,931 --> 00:51:10,232
              I mean, it has
              always been you.

836
00:51:11,935 --> 00:51:13,936
            I love you, Amanda,

837
00:51:14,037 --> 00:51:16,939
         and I will do
         everything I have to
         to win your trust back.

838
00:51:28,852 --> 00:51:31,187
      ( laughing )

839
00:51:33,857 --> 00:51:35,558
                   Not so fast!

840
00:51:38,662 --> 00:51:41,997
        ( clears throat )
        What's going on?

841
00:51:42,065 --> 00:51:46,001
It appears Heather's
father has left.

842
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:49,038
            Uh, he left because

843
00:51:49,139 --> 00:51:51,474
              your mom tried
              to pay him off.

844
00:51:51,575 --> 00:51:53,876
And now I don't even
have a dad.

845
00:51:53,977 --> 00:51:57,513
So this is the only place
I could think of to go.

846
00:51:57,614 --> 00:51:59,582
      Is this true?

847
00:51:59,683 --> 00:52:02,551
   - I was trying to
   help you, Connor.
   - How is that helping, Mom?

848
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:06,155
She's pregnant with my kid.
she can't just be living
in the streets.

849
00:52:08,492 --> 00:52:10,626
         Amanda!

850
00:52:14,564 --> 00:52:17,233
             Hey, Amanda, wait.

851
00:52:17,334 --> 00:52:19,635
             This doesn't change
            anything, all right?

852
00:52:19,736 --> 00:52:22,104
What do you mean,
it doesn't change
anything, Connor?

853
00:52:22,205 --> 00:52:24,540
It's obvious where
she's gonna be staying--
with you.

854
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:27,543
And that...
that changes everything.

855
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:30,613
( car door opens, shuts )

856
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:33,182
( engine starts )

857
00:52:33,283 --> 00:52:35,584
( car drives away )

858
00:52:35,685 --> 00:52:37,920
  ( sobbing )

859
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:44,426
                  Hey.

860
00:52:44,528 --> 00:52:46,495
                What's wrong?
                Are you okay?

861
00:52:46,596 --> 00:52:48,998
      I don't think
     I can do this.

862
00:53:06,783 --> 00:53:09,518
       This... is amazing.

863
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:12,421
      In the past couple weeks,
      I really feel like
      I've been eating for two.

864
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:16,292
 Oh, by the way,
 there's a school
 field trip next week,

865
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:18,627
 and I was hoping
 maybe you could sign
 the permission form.

866
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:20,396
   It's, like,
   20 bucks to go.

867
00:53:20,497 --> 00:53:23,032
So, um, Heather,

868
00:53:23,133 --> 00:53:26,035
have you started
thinking about a plan

869
00:53:26,136 --> 00:53:28,704
    - for you, for the baby?
    - Yeah, I have.

870
00:53:28,805 --> 00:53:31,774
I was thinking maybe
we could set up a room here,
like a nursery,

871
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:35,244
           and Connor and I
           could live here,
           unless, of course,

872
00:53:35,345 --> 00:53:37,646
you wanted us to
live somewhere else,
and I'm sure you guys would

873
00:53:37,747 --> 00:53:39,448
       help us out with
        a down payment.

874
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:42,251
PETER:
Well, Connor needs
to finish school.

875
00:53:42,352 --> 00:53:44,920
And by "school"
I mean college.

876
00:53:45,021 --> 00:53:46,722
Whittendale.

877
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:50,392
           Actually,
           I've decided to stay.

878
00:53:50,493 --> 00:53:52,761
       Go to community college.

879
00:53:52,829 --> 00:53:55,331
        That way I can still get
        my degree and at least

880
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:57,866
            be here, you know,
            for everything.

881
00:53:57,968 --> 00:54:00,769
           But that doesn't mean
           I'm moving out.

882
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:03,806
            Amanda and I still
            haven't talked about
            our plan yet.

883
00:54:12,849 --> 00:54:14,149
             <i> ( line ringing )</i>

884
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:16,385
              ( ringing )

885
00:54:19,489 --> 00:54:21,657
        <i> Hey, it's me, Amanda.</i>
        <i> Leave me a message.</i>

886
00:54:25,695 --> 00:54:27,463
CONNOR:
Hey, Amanda.

887
00:54:27,564 --> 00:54:30,733
Listen, I meant it when
I said nothing's changed.

888
00:54:30,834 --> 00:54:34,336
         Trust me.
         Let me pick you up
         for breakfast tomorrow,

889
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:38,340
          and then I'll take you
          to Lamaze. Please.

890
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:40,242
                  I love you.

891
00:54:40,343 --> 00:54:43,212
             Uh, are you lost?

892
00:54:43,313 --> 00:54:45,914
            Would you like me
            to show you back
            to your room

893
00:54:46,016 --> 00:54:47,516
              on the other side
              of the house?

894
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:49,151
              ( wry chuckle )

895
00:54:53,823 --> 00:54:56,091
                 Good night.

896
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:09,071
Brought you
something to eat.

897
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:12,041
             Look, Amanda,

898
00:55:12,108 --> 00:55:15,044
     I understand it must be
     so hard knowing that
     Heather's over at Connor's,

899
00:55:15,111 --> 00:55:17,446
          but he's just trying
          to do the right thing.

900
00:55:17,514 --> 00:55:19,315
        I know.

901
00:55:19,416 --> 00:55:21,250
    It's just,
    so much has happened,

902
00:55:21,351 --> 00:55:24,286
    and the babies
    haven't even come yet.

903
00:55:24,387 --> 00:55:27,756
    Connor's not ready
    to be a dad.

904
00:55:27,857 --> 00:55:29,425
    Not to two kids.

905
00:55:31,761 --> 00:55:34,229
  Maybe keeping the baby
  isn't the best decision.

906
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,499
           What are you saying?

907
00:55:37,567 --> 00:55:40,069
    Maybe Kelly and Greg
     are better parents.

908
00:55:40,136 --> 00:55:43,205
           Oh, Amanda, sweetie.

909
00:55:43,273 --> 00:55:45,007
             Look,
             giving up a child

910
00:55:45,108 --> 00:55:47,943
             is one of the most
             difficult things
             a mother can do.

911
00:55:48,044 --> 00:55:52,715
      - Have you talked
      to Connor about this?
      - No.

912
00:55:52,816 --> 00:55:54,850
                You need to,

913
00:55:54,918 --> 00:55:57,786
      because this is a decision
      that you need to make
      together, okay?

914
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:20,042
                ( beeps )

915
00:56:24,447 --> 00:56:28,317
       - Hey, sleepyhead.
          You slept in.
        - Where's my mom?

916
00:56:28,418 --> 00:56:30,352
          Oh, she had
          a hair appointment
          or some stupid errand.

917
00:56:30,453 --> 00:56:32,087
                  I don't know.
                  ( giggles )

918
00:56:32,188 --> 00:56:33,455
                  I made you
                  ham and eggs.

919
00:56:35,325 --> 00:56:37,126
      - My dad already left
      for his trip?
      - Yeah.

920
00:56:37,193 --> 00:56:39,161
        He was gone by the time
        I got up this morning.

921
00:56:39,262 --> 00:56:41,463
         Left a hot new Mercedes
         in the garage.

922
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:43,899
        What's the deal?
        Does he get a new one
        every year or something?

923
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,335
Yeah, it's a company car.
They lease it to him.

924
00:56:46,436 --> 00:56:48,170
                    Mm, nice.

925
00:56:48,271 --> 00:56:50,372
            We should break in
            to that one too.

926
00:56:50,473 --> 00:56:52,541
                  ( giggles )

927
00:56:52,642 --> 00:56:55,077
     - Where are you going?
     - Just out.

928
00:56:55,145 --> 00:56:56,779
           Well, I thought
           that we could spend
           the day together,

929
00:56:56,846 --> 00:56:58,447
                  look at cribs
                  and stuff.

930
00:56:58,548 --> 00:57:00,616
Heather, you're not due
for another six weeks.

931
00:57:00,683 --> 00:57:03,986
       - Are you going to
       see Amanda?
       - ( scoffs )

932
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:06,155
        - Connor!
        - ( door shuts )

933
00:57:07,457 --> 00:57:09,525
          ( car engine starts )

934
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:12,928
( car drives away )

935
00:57:35,985 --> 00:57:37,986
          ( garage door opens )

936
00:57:46,663 --> 00:57:49,264
       - What nice wheels.
       - What the hell are
       you doing here?

937
00:57:49,365 --> 00:57:53,168
    I came to see
    how much swag
    you ditched me for.

938
00:57:53,269 --> 00:57:56,472
   Where are you going?
   Hey.

939
00:57:56,573 --> 00:57:59,775
        It's not bad.

940
00:57:59,876 --> 00:58:02,911
I could use one of these,
seeing as they took my truck.

941
00:58:03,012 --> 00:58:04,513
      They wouldn't repossess it
      if you got a job.

942
00:58:04,614 --> 00:58:06,815
That's a great idea.

943
00:58:06,883 --> 00:58:08,617
Oh, you know
what's a better idea?

944
00:58:08,718 --> 00:58:10,252
I was thinking about this
on my ride over here.

945
00:58:10,353 --> 00:58:12,754
               Seeing as
               one of your plans

946
00:58:12,856 --> 00:58:14,456
finally seems
to have worked out,

947
00:58:14,557 --> 00:58:18,393
I figure that you...
you can start paying me.

948
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,963
      - Screw you, Trent.
      - Yeah, you did that
      already.

949
00:58:21,064 --> 00:58:25,033
   Remember?
   Now it's my turn
   to screw you.

950
00:58:25,134 --> 00:58:28,136
Look, if you don't start
throwing a little
something my way,

951
00:58:28,238 --> 00:58:31,273
I'm gonna make things...
I'm gonna make things

952
00:58:31,374 --> 00:58:33,909
really uncomfortable
for you here.

953
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:36,411
   You forget that
   I know you.

954
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:39,515
I know who
you really are.

955
00:58:43,286 --> 00:58:45,854
You tell that kid about
the other rich dude you
tried to hook up with?

956
00:58:45,955 --> 00:58:48,290
You tell him about
your miscarriages?

957
00:58:50,326 --> 00:58:52,427
There's a ball of secrets.

958
00:58:52,495 --> 00:58:54,897
 So I recommend
 you just pay me.

959
00:58:56,766 --> 00:58:58,867
Where's their jewelry?

960
00:58:58,968 --> 00:59:00,602
Hmm?

961
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:02,771
I can tell by
that belly of yours

962
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:04,573
         you've been
         putting in some work.

963
00:59:04,674 --> 00:59:07,910
You're such
a little slut.

964
00:59:10,647 --> 00:59:12,614
       ( exclaiming )

965
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:25,761
( Heather grunting )

966
00:59:41,611 --> 00:59:43,845
          WOMAN:
          All righty, everyone.

967
00:59:43,947 --> 00:59:46,481
             Today, we are going
             to practice

968
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:48,550
                  breathing.

969
00:59:48,651 --> 00:59:51,153
                  So, now,
                  let's take

970
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:54,556
               a deep, cleansing
               breath in...

971
00:59:54,624 --> 00:59:56,758
         ( inhaling )

972
00:59:56,859 --> 00:59:59,161
                and out.

973
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:01,530
        - ( exhaling )
        - And now I want

974
01:00:01,631 --> 01:00:03,732
        all the partners
        breathing as well, okay?

975
01:00:03,833 --> 01:00:07,135
              And breathe in...
              ( inhaling )

976
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:13,609
          Now, partners,
          I want you to wrap

977
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:16,445
        your arms
        around the mother

978
01:00:16,546 --> 01:00:19,181
            as she leans back

979
01:00:19,248 --> 01:00:21,283
                   into you.

980
01:00:24,354 --> 01:00:26,488
               Excellent. Okay.

981
01:00:44,207 --> 01:00:46,908
Oh! Did you feel that?

982
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:50,012
      Yeah, she's always active
      during this time.

983
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:52,814
   - Did you feel that?
   - Yeah. That's incredible.

984
01:00:52,882 --> 01:00:54,983
                      I know.

985
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:07,029
         WOMAN:
         All righty, everybody,

986
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:08,530
          I want you to
          continue practicing

987
01:01:08,631 --> 01:01:10,866
                your breathing
                techniques,

988
01:01:10,967 --> 01:01:12,501
                 and we will see
                 you next week.

989
01:01:30,753 --> 01:01:32,954
        ( engine starts )

990
01:01:46,769 --> 01:01:48,837
                  Look, Connor,

991
01:01:48,938 --> 01:01:50,939
             I know you've been
             trying, but...

992
01:01:51,007 --> 01:01:53,875
        I've been thinking a lot
        about you being a dad

993
01:01:53,943 --> 01:01:56,044
             not to just one
             but to two babies.

994
01:01:56,145 --> 01:01:58,513
              I mean,
              you're only 17.

995
01:01:58,614 --> 01:02:01,983
        And trust me, I know
        that you would give up
        anything for our baby,

996
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:03,618
             just like I would,

997
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:06,154
            but what if
            there's another way?

998
01:02:06,255 --> 01:02:09,825
         A way that we could
         give our baby
         the best life possible

999
01:02:09,926 --> 01:02:11,960
            and make someone
            very, very happy?

1000
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:16,264
I just want you
to think about
what I'm about to say.

1001
01:02:20,503 --> 01:02:22,838
 What are you
 talking about?

1002
01:02:22,939 --> 01:02:25,006
              I'm talking about
              giving our baby
              to my sister.

1003
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:28,210
            I mean, she's been
            trying everything,

1004
01:02:28,277 --> 01:02:30,979
  and nothing's working,
  and it's breaking her heart.

1005
01:02:31,047 --> 01:02:34,649
   And here I am, pregnant,
   and I didn't plan for this.

1006
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:41,690
       So it made me wonder that
       maybe this is a sign.

1007
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:44,626
           Maybe I was supposed
           to get pregnant,

1008
01:02:44,694 --> 01:02:47,062
            and she's meant
            to have the baby.

1009
01:02:48,197 --> 01:02:49,931
So this is what
you want to do?

1010
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:53,101
                  If you do.

1011
01:02:54,804 --> 01:02:57,339
I-I don't know.

1012
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:00,642
      I really don't know.

1013
01:03:04,347 --> 01:03:06,314
                And that's why
                I love you.

1014
01:03:32,408 --> 01:03:35,210
                  ( screaming )

1015
01:04:01,103 --> 01:04:03,104
            ( gasps )

1016
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:28,530
           ( tapping glass )
           Get out of the car.
           Get out of the car!

1017
01:04:28,631 --> 01:04:30,932
    What the hell do you
     think you're doing?

1018
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,735
    I called the police
    'cause I thought somebody
    had stolen the car.

1019
01:04:33,803 --> 01:04:37,305
   What made you think
   you could take Peter's car
   without even asking, huh?

1020
01:04:38,841 --> 01:04:41,276
                Really?
                That's it?

1021
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:44,145
             No apology?
             You listen to me.

1022
01:04:44,247 --> 01:04:46,147
   You know you're not a part
   of this family, Heather.

1023
01:04:46,249 --> 01:04:47,916
      You're only here
      because of my grandchild.

1024
01:04:48,017 --> 01:04:49,651
         So don't make yourself
         so damned comfortable.

1025
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:51,586
   Because Connor won't
   have you, ever!

1026
01:04:51,687 --> 01:04:54,256
I am just so sick of you,
you meddling bitch!

1027
01:04:54,323 --> 01:04:56,157
You just can't
leave us alone, can you?

1028
01:04:56,259 --> 01:04:59,961
I mean, don't you get it?
I am having your son's baby.

1029
01:05:00,062 --> 01:05:01,897
Me. That's right.

1030
01:05:01,964 --> 01:05:03,832
The girl from the wrong side
of the tracks.

1031
01:05:03,933 --> 01:05:07,002
Is that what's
so horrifying to you?
That I'm not good enough?

1032
01:05:07,103 --> 01:05:10,605
What's so horrifying to me
is what kind of person you are.

1033
01:05:10,706 --> 01:05:13,041
                Manipulative,
                conniving.

1034
01:05:13,142 --> 01:05:15,644
               In fact, I'm now
               really worried

1035
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:17,846
             whether you're
             even a fit mother
             for my grandchild.

1036
01:05:17,947 --> 01:05:20,782
        - ( exclaims )
        -Are you insane?

1037
01:05:20,850 --> 01:05:24,819
    - What is wrong with you?
    - Don't you mess with me
    or my baby, Diane,

1038
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:27,856
because you will be
so sorry!

1039
01:05:38,534 --> 01:05:41,202
              What's up, buddy?

1040
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:43,705
So, how'd you sleep
last night?

1041
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:45,040
                     Fine.

1042
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:49,177
Did you get any?

1043
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:51,479
No, hey, hey, hey,
how is it to hook up
with a pregnant chick?

1044
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:54,582
      - Dude, what are you
      talking about?
      - Oh, okay.

1045
01:05:54,684 --> 01:05:56,484
You're not gonna
 tell me? Bro...

1046
01:05:56,585 --> 01:05:58,153
   Look.

1047
01:05:58,220 --> 01:06:01,089
            ( phone beeps )

1048
01:06:01,157 --> 01:06:03,658
You're a freak, bro.
You're a freak.

1049
01:06:06,295 --> 01:06:08,096
                ( door shuts )

1050
01:06:14,403 --> 01:06:16,004
               What happened?

1051
01:06:16,105 --> 01:06:18,573
The mother of
your child, Heather,
just went crazy.

1052
01:06:18,674 --> 01:06:20,775
Look, Connor, she can't
stay here anymore.

1053
01:06:20,843 --> 01:06:23,645
That's it. I won't have it.
I will pay to have her
put up somewhere,

1054
01:06:23,713 --> 01:06:25,747
but she is not staying
in this house.

1055
01:06:25,848 --> 01:06:27,882
I am not going to be
assaulted in my own home.
That's it.

1056
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:30,085
                  She hurt you?

1057
01:06:35,057 --> 01:06:36,925
    I got it.

1058
01:06:52,975 --> 01:06:55,477
           - Get out.
           - Look.

1059
01:06:55,578 --> 01:06:58,446
I thought I'd use this photo
until we get a real photo
of the three of us together.

1060
01:06:58,547 --> 01:07:00,448
           You have crossed
           the line.

1061
01:07:00,549 --> 01:07:02,751
             I mean, taking
             pictures of us

1062
01:07:02,818 --> 01:07:04,419
            sleeping together
            is bad enough,

1063
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:06,855
              but when you hurt
             my mom, that's it.

1064
01:07:06,922 --> 01:07:10,525
 - I want you out!
 - Really? And why do you think
 I'm here in the first place?

1065
01:07:10,626 --> 01:07:12,594
Or did you forget
what your mother did?

1066
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:15,130
          I don't care, Heather.
          Okay?

1067
01:07:15,197 --> 01:07:18,400
    I am done being the good guy
    because you are crazy!

1068
01:07:18,501 --> 01:07:21,436
      Okay? It doesn't matter
      how many pictures you take
      of us together,

1069
01:07:21,537 --> 01:07:23,705
           we are not a couple!

1070
01:07:23,773 --> 01:07:26,441
          Because I love Amanda.
          And you?

1071
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:28,276
         I don't even like you.

1072
01:07:28,377 --> 01:07:30,512
Wait. Wait!

1073
01:07:30,613 --> 01:07:32,981
  Connor! I didn't mean
  to hurt your mom!

1074
01:07:33,082 --> 01:07:35,450
Connor, I'm sorry!

1075
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:39,721
         Connor! Connor!
         Connor!

1076
01:07:47,496 --> 01:07:50,865
Have you thought at all
about what we talked about?

1077
01:07:50,966 --> 01:07:53,401
Kelly and the baby?

1078
01:07:53,502 --> 01:07:55,403
                       Yeah.

1079
01:07:55,504 --> 01:07:58,039
       And I'm starting to think
       maybe you're right.

1080
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:02,944
         Maybe there is a reason
         you got pregnant.

1081
01:08:34,810 --> 01:08:36,845
       ( screams )

1082
01:08:40,015 --> 01:08:41,583
JEFF:
Okay, it's ready.

1083
01:08:41,650 --> 01:08:43,952
         Dad, will you hand me
         a hot dog, please?

1084
01:08:44,019 --> 01:08:46,354
         - Yes, sweetie.
         - Thank you.

1085
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:49,023
        - Remember I like
        my burgers rare.
        - Yes, sir.

1086
01:08:50,926 --> 01:08:53,528
             Kelly, Greg, uh,

1087
01:08:53,629 --> 01:08:56,631
               Connor and I have
               something we want
               to ask you.

1088
01:08:56,732 --> 01:08:58,700
            We've been talking,

1089
01:08:58,767 --> 01:09:02,470
           and of course we want
           what's best for
           our little girl,

1090
01:09:02,571 --> 01:09:04,606
          and we've agreed that

1091
01:09:04,673 --> 01:09:07,242
           the best is you two.

1092
01:09:12,181 --> 01:09:14,215
I'm not following.

1093
01:09:14,316 --> 01:09:16,618
           We want to know if
           you'd adopt our baby.

1094
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:19,053
Are you serious?

1095
01:09:19,121 --> 01:09:22,590
              I mean, you guys
              have wanted this
              for so long,

1096
01:09:22,691 --> 01:09:25,093
           and you would just be
           amazing parents.

1097
01:09:25,194 --> 01:09:27,762
( voice quavering )
Amanda, are you sure?

1098
01:09:29,265 --> 01:09:30,932
         We're sure.

1099
01:09:31,033 --> 01:09:33,868
I don't know what to say.

1100
01:09:33,969 --> 01:09:37,005
     - Say yes.
     - ( laughing, sobbing )

1101
01:09:43,012 --> 01:09:44,913
Thank you, thank you!

1102
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:48,783
       - Congratulations.
       - I'm assuming that
       that's a yes.

1103
01:09:48,884 --> 01:09:50,318
          Yes, of course it is.

1104
01:09:50,419 --> 01:09:52,887
   You guys are
   gonna be great.

1105
01:09:52,988 --> 01:09:54,756
                     Thank you.

1106
01:09:54,823 --> 01:09:57,625
             - JEFF:
      I want to do a toast.
             - Yes.

1107
01:09:59,795 --> 01:10:02,363
        - To family.
        - ALL: To family.

1108
01:10:04,567 --> 01:10:06,601
    We're gonna
   have a baby!

1109
01:10:09,805 --> 01:10:11,906
It's okay.

1110
01:10:20,015 --> 01:10:21,983
        ( beeping )

1111
01:10:27,122 --> 01:10:29,290
               ( chuckles )

1112
01:10:41,971 --> 01:10:43,671
.

1113
01:10:43,772 --> 01:10:45,740
                 If you haven't
                 handed me

1114
01:10:45,841 --> 01:10:48,977
      a signed permission form
      to go on this field trip,
      you can't go.

1115
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:51,479
        - Does everyone
        understand that?
        - ALL: Yes.

1116
01:10:51,547 --> 01:10:53,414
               All right? Okay.
               Line up.

1117
01:10:53,515 --> 01:10:55,783
      - Is Heather coming?
      - I think so.

1118
01:10:55,851 --> 01:10:58,453
My mom signed her form.

1119
01:11:00,422 --> 01:11:02,457
        ( gasps, groans )

1120
01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:05,994
( bus engine starts )

1121
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:08,963
         ( groans )

1122
01:11:22,378 --> 01:11:24,946
      MRS. WOLK:
      All right, everybody,
      buckle up. Let's go.

1123
01:11:33,622 --> 01:11:35,456
        ( students chattering )

1124
01:11:37,459 --> 01:11:39,227
       Yay! We're here!

1125
01:11:39,328 --> 01:11:41,162
All right, we're going to
break up into two groups.

1126
01:11:41,263 --> 01:11:44,165
   Group A goes into
the conservation center
   with Gray Eagle,

1127
01:11:44,266 --> 01:11:47,335
and group B will
join me in the park.

1128
01:11:49,071 --> 01:11:51,639
    - Are you gonna be okay?
    - Yeah. I'll be fine.

1129
01:11:55,511 --> 01:11:58,112
   All right, everyone,
   let's go.

1130
01:12:00,649 --> 01:12:03,651
MAN:
Have a wonderful day.
Follow me.

1131
01:12:05,454 --> 01:12:07,555
          ( groans )

1132
01:12:16,265 --> 01:12:18,466
Hey, check this out.

1133
01:12:18,534 --> 01:12:21,636
  - ( chattering )
  - Dude, look at this in here.

1134
01:12:29,912 --> 01:12:32,146
Mrs. Wolk, I have to
use the restroom.

1135
01:12:32,247 --> 01:12:34,916
     Oh. Okay, there's one back
     in the conservation center.

1136
01:12:34,983 --> 01:12:36,984
     Take the shortcut,
     but stay on the trail.

1137
01:12:37,086 --> 01:12:38,786
            - I will.
            - Okay.

1138
01:12:39,955 --> 01:12:41,055
       <i> ( birds chirping )</i>

1139
01:13:01,176 --> 01:13:03,678
       <i> ( insects buzzing,</i>
        <i> birds warbling )</i>

1140
01:13:37,946 --> 01:13:39,580
    <i> ( suspenseful music )</i>

1141
01:13:39,681 --> 01:13:42,750
       ( gasps )
       God, Heather!
       What are you doing here?

1142
01:13:42,818 --> 01:13:45,319
Just making sure
you don't get lost.

1143
01:13:46,655 --> 01:13:48,256
            You know, we were
            planning on getting

1144
01:13:48,357 --> 01:13:50,758
          our own place together
          to raise our baby.

1145
01:13:50,826 --> 01:13:53,461
   That's actually the reason
   why his parents put me up
   in an apartment--

1146
01:13:53,562 --> 01:13:55,430
        because they just
        couldn't handle the fact

1147
01:13:55,497 --> 01:13:57,632
      that their precious Connor
      wasn't theirs anymore.

1148
01:13:57,733 --> 01:14:01,402
- You're lying, Heather.
That was never going to happen.
- No?

1149
01:14:01,503 --> 01:14:03,738
     You know that picture
     of you two next to his bed?

1150
01:14:03,806 --> 01:14:07,708
    He actually put that away
    and replaced it with
    a picture of our ultrasound.

1151
01:14:07,776 --> 01:14:09,610
       And I never asked him to.
       He just did it.

1152
01:14:09,711 --> 01:14:11,746
           And he just loves
           my pregnant body.

1153
01:14:11,814 --> 01:14:14,849
          And the best part is,
          we don't have to use
          any protection.

1154
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:16,918
        It's just so awesome.
        It's so intimate.

1155
01:14:17,019 --> 01:14:19,053
            It's just me, him,
            and his baby.

1156
01:14:19,154 --> 01:14:22,990
Just stop, Heather!
He'd never sleep with you,
all right?

1157
01:14:23,091 --> 01:14:26,727
  He doesn't love you,
  and he's said so himself.

1158
01:14:26,829 --> 01:14:28,863
I mean, God, when are
you gonna get it

1159
01:14:28,964 --> 01:14:30,832
through that twisted
head of yours

1160
01:14:30,933 --> 01:14:32,733
that you're just
a mistake that he made?

1161
01:14:32,835 --> 01:14:35,803
 Your little plan to
trap him or whatever
obviously backfired,

1162
01:14:35,904 --> 01:14:37,738
'cause where are you now?

1163
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:40,308
You're alone
in some apartment,

1164
01:14:40,409 --> 01:14:43,678
and soon you're gonna
be alone with a baby
to take care of.

1165
01:14:43,779 --> 01:14:46,047
Is that what you wanted?
'Cause if it is,

1166
01:14:46,148 --> 01:14:48,449
congratulations--
you got it.

1167
01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:51,152
              You stupid bitch!

1168
01:14:51,253 --> 01:14:52,587
                 Why?

1169
01:14:52,688 --> 01:14:55,423
          Why did you have to
          get pregnant?

1170
01:14:55,524 --> 01:14:57,225
            He didn't want you!

1171
01:14:57,326 --> 01:15:00,428
       He wanted me!
       And he still does!

1172
01:15:00,529 --> 01:15:04,165
    Because he promised that
    he will take care of me!

1173
01:15:04,266 --> 01:15:06,067
         Of us! And you?

1174
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:09,604
       Why are you trying
       to ruin this? Why?

1175
01:15:09,705 --> 01:15:11,973
             You already have
             a family!

1176
01:15:12,074 --> 01:15:15,276
           And what do I have?
           I have nothing!

1177
01:15:15,377 --> 01:15:18,379
         Everyone in my life
         has left me. Do you
         know what that's like?

1178
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:21,782
     No, of course you don't,
     because you have everything

1179
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:24,852
         that you want,
         you stupid, spoiled,

1180
01:15:24,953 --> 01:15:26,387
      selfish little bitch!

1181
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:33,995
                   Miss Wolk.

1182
01:15:35,397 --> 01:15:37,131
                Where's Amanda?

1183
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:39,166
I thought she came back
to use the restroom.

1184
01:15:39,268 --> 01:15:41,936
              I didn't see her.

1185
01:15:42,037 --> 01:15:43,971
       - Let me go check.
       - Okay.

1186
01:15:45,474 --> 01:15:47,341
Have you guys
seen Amanda?

1187
01:15:47,442 --> 01:15:49,410
Ladies, have you
seen Amanda?

1188
01:15:51,246 --> 01:15:52,980
                     HEATHER:
                      Amanda!

1189
01:15:53,081 --> 01:15:55,016
        ( gasping )

1190
01:16:07,963 --> 01:16:09,463
            ( gasps )

1191
01:16:13,769 --> 01:16:16,070
      ( screams )

1192
01:16:18,607 --> 01:16:21,976
          ( groaning )

1193
01:16:24,112 --> 01:16:26,581
    She's not there.

1194
01:16:26,682 --> 01:16:29,183
         Okay, I want everyone
         inside, and stay there
         until the next lecture.

1195
01:16:29,284 --> 01:16:31,352
      ( moaning softly )

1196
01:16:33,121 --> 01:16:35,323
         ( groaning )

1197
01:16:51,873 --> 01:16:53,708
( groaning )

1198
01:17:00,916 --> 01:17:03,718
                     Amanda!

1199
01:17:03,819 --> 01:17:05,786
                 Amanda!

1200
01:17:13,929 --> 01:17:15,796
              ( groaning )

1201
01:17:15,897 --> 01:17:19,200
            Amanda!
            The baby's coming!

1202
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:22,837
         Amanda, please help!

1203
01:17:22,938 --> 01:17:26,907
       Come back, please!
       The baby's coming!
        I need your help!

1204
01:17:27,009 --> 01:17:30,444
          ( screaming )
          Amanda!

1205
01:17:30,545 --> 01:17:33,848
       The baby's coming!
       The baby's coming!

1206
01:17:33,949 --> 01:17:36,684
                       Help!

1207
01:17:36,785 --> 01:17:38,285
                 Amanda, help!

1208
01:17:38,353 --> 01:17:40,054
   - We have to get you back.
   - No, I can't!

1209
01:17:40,155 --> 01:17:42,623
      - I don't know. Um...
      - Oh, do something!

1210
01:17:42,691 --> 01:17:44,725
Okay, give me your shirt.
Give me your shirt.

1211
01:17:46,762 --> 01:17:48,896
                     Amanda!

1212
01:17:54,002 --> 01:17:56,103
       Okay, I need you
       to push.

1213
01:17:56,204 --> 01:17:58,839
       - I can't!
       - Heather,
       I need you to push!

1214
01:17:58,940 --> 01:18:00,775
         - ( cries out )
         - Push!

1215
01:18:00,876 --> 01:18:02,643
          - I can't!
          - Breathe!

1216
01:18:02,744 --> 01:18:05,613
     - ( panting )
     - Heather, do you want
     to have this baby?

1217
01:18:05,714 --> 01:18:08,716
          - Yes!
          - Then push!

1218
01:18:08,817 --> 01:18:11,252
         ( groaning, screams )

1219
01:18:12,921 --> 01:18:14,555
                ( screaming )

1220
01:18:22,397 --> 01:18:24,999
       - ( baby crying )
       - ( Heather gasps )

1221
01:18:34,342 --> 01:18:36,911
           ( groans, laughs )

1222
01:18:42,417 --> 01:18:44,218
         Amanda! Amanda!

1223
01:18:46,621 --> 01:18:51,025
It's our baby, Connor.
It's our baby!

1224
01:19:14,116 --> 01:19:16,183
AMANDA:
Oh, my gosh.

1225
01:19:16,284 --> 01:19:18,886
She's so adorable.

1226
01:19:20,322 --> 01:19:22,022
CONNOR:
Look at that.

1227
01:19:22,124 --> 01:19:23,858
Look at her smile.

1228
01:19:23,959 --> 01:19:25,793
   Hi, little girl.

1229
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:30,798
I have just been
dying to meet you.

1230
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:34,668
          ( sniffles )

1231
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:38,305
       This is your daddy.

1232
01:19:40,008 --> 01:19:42,143
                 He loves you
                 very much.

1233
01:19:44,045 --> 01:19:46,680
                  We both do.

1234
01:19:46,748 --> 01:19:50,317
               That's why
               it was so hard

1235
01:19:51,853 --> 01:19:54,955
              to do what's best
             for you right now.

1236
01:19:56,324 --> 01:19:58,659
       ( sniffles )

1237
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:02,763
    But don't you worry.

1238
01:20:02,864 --> 01:20:05,065
      We'll always
      be here for you.

1239
01:20:05,167 --> 01:20:09,436
And one day,
you will have
a little cousin

1240
01:20:09,538 --> 01:20:12,039
                that you can
                play with.

1241
01:20:20,916 --> 01:20:23,684
         ( whispering )
         I love you, baby girl.

1242
01:20:24,853 --> 01:20:27,955
With all of my heart.

1243
01:20:29,991 --> 01:20:31,759
Are you ready?

1244
01:20:34,729 --> 01:20:36,397
                         KELLY:
                         Hey.

1245
01:20:37,966 --> 01:20:40,334
        How are you both doing?

1246
01:20:40,402 --> 01:20:43,671
       - Okay.
       - She's beautiful,

1247
01:20:43,772 --> 01:20:46,674
            just like you.

1248
01:20:46,775 --> 01:20:48,843
             I mean,
             look at that nose.

1249
01:20:48,910 --> 01:20:51,712
               ( chuckles )
               There's no doubt
               she's your baby.

1250
01:20:57,953 --> 01:21:00,688
           She's yours, Amanda.

1251
01:21:00,789 --> 01:21:02,690
            Yours and Connor's.

1252
01:21:02,791 --> 01:21:04,792
            You're her parents.

1253
01:21:04,893 --> 01:21:09,129
             It wouldn't be
             right for us to
             take her from you.

1254
01:21:09,231 --> 01:21:11,765
         But you've wanted
         a family for so long,

1255
01:21:11,867 --> 01:21:14,468
     and you were so happy.

1256
01:21:14,536 --> 01:21:15,936
                 There's still
                 time for me.

1257
01:21:16,037 --> 01:21:18,172
             Don't worry.
             I'll be just fine.

1258
01:21:18,273 --> 01:21:20,908
            Besides,
            I am going to be

1259
01:21:21,009 --> 01:21:24,245
            the coolest aunt
            in the world.

1260
01:21:25,947 --> 01:21:27,581
                  I love you.

1261
01:21:27,682 --> 01:21:30,084
         I love you too.

1262
01:21:35,757 --> 01:21:38,859
Knock, knock.
How's my little girl
and my granddaughter?

1263
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:40,294
           - Hi!
           - Perfect.

1264
01:21:40,395 --> 01:21:42,563
               Oh!

1265
01:21:42,664 --> 01:21:45,366
      - Oh, there's my boy.
      - There he is.

1266
01:21:45,467 --> 01:21:47,835
  - How's he doing?
  - Oh, he's doing great. He's
  gaining a pound a day, I bet.

1267
01:21:47,936 --> 01:21:50,271
This kid, he has
an iron grip.

1268
01:21:50,372 --> 01:21:52,239
He grabs a hold
of your finger,
and he never lets go.

1269
01:21:52,340 --> 01:21:53,974
        He's gonna be a bruiser
        like his dad.

1270
01:21:54,075 --> 01:21:56,677
           We just wanted to
           come by and say hi.

1271
01:21:56,778 --> 01:21:58,345
          We want to give
          you guys your privacy.

1272
01:21:58,446 --> 01:22:00,047
    We'll come back
    a little later.

1273
01:22:00,148 --> 01:22:02,082
            Hold on. I want to
            get a picture first.

1274
01:22:02,183 --> 01:22:05,085
           Connor, you're there
           next to Amanda.
           You and Ryan.

1275
01:22:05,186 --> 01:22:07,321
      This is gonna be
      our first family portrait.

1276
01:22:07,422 --> 01:22:09,790
           All right, now,
           just hold that pose
           and say "cheese."

1277
01:22:09,891 --> 01:22:12,760
       All right, now, everyone,
       a selfie. Let's do it.

1278
01:22:12,861 --> 01:22:14,862
     - Selfie!
     - AMANDA: Mom, did you
     just say "selfie"?

1279
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:17,031
    - Yes.
    - Parents aren't allowed
    to say "selfie."

1280
01:22:17,132 --> 01:22:19,233
        - Yeah, we are.
        - No, you're not.

1281
01:22:19,334 --> 01:22:22,136
       - We old folks get
       to do it too!
       - She loves these.

1282
01:22:22,237 --> 01:22:24,038
              Cheese!
              Say "selfie."

1283
01:22:24,139 --> 01:22:27,708
Well, they found Trent's body
in your basement.

1284
01:22:27,809 --> 01:22:30,277
Your dad was out of town,

1285
01:22:30,378 --> 01:22:32,646
so all the evidence
points to you.

1286
01:22:32,747 --> 01:22:35,249
If you don't take the plea,

1287
01:22:35,350 --> 01:22:38,585
it's life in prison,
no parole.

1288
01:22:38,687 --> 01:22:40,721
Take the plea, you might
be out in 20 or less

1289
01:22:40,822 --> 01:22:42,723
  with good behavior.

1290
01:22:42,824 --> 01:22:44,491
                   Whatever.

1291
01:22:50,665 --> 01:22:53,133
          Can I get some water?

1292
01:22:55,236 --> 01:22:56,670
         Sure.

1293
01:22:58,573 --> 01:23:00,674

1294
