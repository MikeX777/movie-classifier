00:00:00,098 --> 00:00:01,598
VERSION 1

2
00:00:02,299 --> 00:00:03,441
Action!

3
00:00:05,631 --> 00:00:08,039
We are a group of filmmakers.

4
00:00:08,346 --> 00:00:12,000
We going to offer with our means

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,000
as actors, directors, technicians

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
a reconstruction of the
three official versions

7
00:00:18,301 --> 00:00:20,000
the versions given by the judicial authorities

8
00:00:20,501 --> 00:00:24,501
of the suicide, the ... alleged
suicide of the anarchist Pinelli.

9
00:00:25,102 --> 00:00:29,802
This office represents the office
of Dott. Calabresi.

10
00:00:29,803 --> 00:00:33,803
Dott. Calabresi, commissioner of the political
office at police HQ in Milan,

11
00:00:34,004 --> 00:00:36,904
Collaborator at the official social-
democratic journal "La Giustizia"

12
00:00:36,905 --> 00:00:39,005
and the newspaper "Momento Sera"

13
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:41,906
was for some months in America

14
00:00:42,006 --> 00:00:44,000
where he is said to have 
received a special training course.

15
00:00:44,407 --> 00:00:50,407
In the circles of the left Milan
he is known as the "CIA Inspector".

16
00:00:50,408 --> 00:00:52,508
The three versions we offer,

17
00:00:52,609 --> 00:00:54,909
that is the official versions, confirmed 
by the juridical authorities,

18
00:00:54,910 --> 00:01:00,000
assume that Calabresi was not 
in his office at this moment.

19
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:01,901
Present were instead

20
00:01:02,202 --> 00:01:05,202
a lieutenant of the Carabinieri and
three officers of the political Police.

21
00:01:05,403 --> 00:01:06,603
And Pinelli.

22
00:01:06,704 --> 00:01:07,904
So, three officers of the political Police,

23
00:01:08,005 --> 00:01:09,005
a lieutenant of the Carabinieri,

24
00:01:09,106 --> 00:01:10,006
and Pinelli.

25
00:01:10,407 --> 00:01:11,307
The Police say

26
00:01:11,308 --> 00:01:14,308
The climate in the room
was very quiet at this moment,

27
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:17,100
since Calabresi was outside.

28
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:20,000
The interrogation was interrupted.

29
00:01:20,001 --> 00:01:22,901
A break in the interrogation, 
which lasted for?

30
00:01:23,002 --> 00:01:24,902
It took three days and three nights.

31
00:01:25,003 --> 00:01:25,803
Three days and three nights.

32
00:01:27,404 --> 00:01:32,004
Has the anarchist Pinelli been 
talking to someone?

33
00:01:32,105 --> 00:01:34,805
On the morning of the last day
he has met his mother

34
00:01:34,906 --> 00:01:36,406
He has spoken to her

35
00:01:36,407 --> 00:01:40,407
He appeared calm, balanced
and sure to be set free again soon,

36
00:01:40,408 --> 00:01:43,208
as no proves of his guilt were found.

37
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:47,400
It is necessary to emphasize something about the person Pinelli:

38
00:01:47,501 --> 00:01:54,101
Pinelli was well known with the 
political Police in Milan,

39
00:01:54,102 --> 00:01:56,802
because for some twenty years
he was well known

40
00:01:56,903 --> 00:02:00,303
Therefore, in the case 
of ... social tensions,

41
00:02:00,604 --> 00:02:02,604
special tensions, the anarchist Pinelli

42
00:02:02,905 --> 00:02:05,605
was one of those persons
that were taken for questioning,

43
00:02:05,706 --> 00:02:08,900
Sp he knew perfectly about the ...

44
00:02:08,901 --> 00:02:13,001
... tricks of the political department
of Milan's Police.

45
00:02:14,002 --> 00:02:16,502
This room represents the office
Dr. Calabresi.

46
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:18,803
We are ... What time is it?

47
00:02:18,904 --> 00:02:22,304
It is about midnight
the 15th December 1969

48
00:02:22,305 --> 00:02:25,005
Midnight of the 15th December 1969.

49
00:02:25,006 --> 00:02:26,506
15th December in Milan.

50
00:02:27,307 --> 00:02:29,500
The windows were ajar ...

51
00:02:29,801 --> 00:02:34,201
so as to let in some air,
as the room ...

52
00:02:37,102 --> 00:02:40,002
During the interrogation, all of them have smoked ...

53
00:02:41,502 --> 00:02:43,402
The sergeant of the Carabinieri ...

54
00:02:43,703 --> 00:02:47,203
May not have been ... here.
To close to the window.

55
00:02:47,504 --> 00:02:49,204
Here neither.

56
00:02:53,005 --> 00:02:55,305
Perhaps the officials ...

57
00:02:55,406 --> 00:02:56,006
were here ...

58
00:02:58,007 --> 00:03:03,407
It is known that Pinelli
at about 22:30 in the evening

59
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,608
phoned his wife

60
00:03:05,609 --> 00:03:07,909
and asked her to search for his 
labour-book as railway worker

61
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:12,910
which would provide a prove in his favor,

62
00:03:13,311 --> 00:03:15,011
an entry about a trip by Pinelli

63
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:16,910
He told his wife,

64
00:03:17,011 --> 00:03:18,211
that a policeman would drop by 
to pick up the book.

65
00:03:18,612 --> 00:03:21,412
That was the evening 22:30 to
the 15th December 1969

66
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,413
At this moment the police officers
were talking among themselves.

67
00:03:26,514 --> 00:03:29,114
Of course, none of them 
paid attention to Pinelli.

68
00:03:29,715 --> 00:03:31,815
They say that I, the anarchist Pinelli,

69
00:03:31,917 --> 00:03:33,417
had got up to stretch myself.

70
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,218
They say that I, the anarchist Pinelli,

71
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,719
I had jumped with a cat-like leap

72
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:42,819
out the window.

73
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,220
The cat-like leap of 
the Anarchist Pinelli.

74
00:03:53,321 --> 00:03:55,221
"Cat-like jump" the precise wording

75
00:03:55,222 --> 00:03:56,222
of the Chief of the Milan Police

76
00:03:56,223 --> 00:04:00,223
to describe Pinelli's 
jump into the yard.

77
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:03,224
Second VERSION, the Third

78
00:04:03,925 --> 00:04:05,325
The second version,

79
00:04:05,426 --> 00:04:08,926
the police has given of the 
suicide of the anarchist Pinelli,

80
00:04:08,927 --> 00:04:11,027
sees a different arrangement 
than before of those 

81
00:04:11,128 --> 00:04:13,828
present in the office of Dr. Calabresi.

82
00:04:13,929 --> 00:04:16,229
We cannot remain
like in the first version,

83
00:04:16,331 --> 00:04:20,531
in which we were neither allowed to 
hear nor see the anarchist Pinelli.

84
00:04:21,032 --> 00:04:24,732
Now,on the other hand, we hear and see him.

85
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:29,033
So you go to the typewriter.

86
00:04:30,134 --> 00:04:32,734
Two officers can be here.

87
00:04:33,235 --> 00:04:36,635
You can sit down on where the
Anarchist Pinelli was sitting before.

88
00:04:38,636 --> 00:04:40,136
They say that I, the anarchist Pinelli,

89
00:04:40,137 --> 00:04:41,737
had gotten up to stretch myself.

90
00:04:45,538 --> 00:04:47,538
And have turned slowly to the window ...

91
00:04:47,539 --> 00:04:49,639
As if to get a little fresh air.

92
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,840
Eh! Stop!

93
00:04:56,441 --> 00:04:58,041
Why he has thrown himself 
out of the window?

94
00:04:58,142 --> 00:04:59,742
He was not even suspected.

95
00:04:59,843 --> 00:05:01,443
He was here for an conversation.

96
00:05:01,444 --> 00:05:02,544
He was quiet.

97
00:05:02,945 --> 00:05:05,545
A few months ago he has given
Dr. Allegra a book.

98
00:05:05,546 --> 00:05:07,046
"A thousand million people"

99
00:05:07,046 --> 00:05:08,546
That was the title of the book.

100
00:05:08,547 --> 00:05:09,647
Why he has thrown himself
out of the window?

101
00:05:10,048 --> 00:05:11,548
We have not done it.

102
00:05:11,749 --> 00:05:13,049
We have not done it.

103
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:16,750
Despite of the four officers

104
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,850
the anarchist Pinelli succeeded in

105
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:21,351
reaching the court.

106
00:05:21,552 --> 00:05:23,552
Third VERSION, the first

107
00:05:30,653 --> 00:05:33,653
We come to the third
and last version

108
00:05:33,654 --> 00:05:37,154
the police has given about the suicide

109
00:05:37,155 --> 00:05:38,955
of the anarchist Pinelli.

110
00:05:42,256 --> 00:05:43,556
I, the anarchist Pinelli,

111
00:05:43,557 --> 00:05:45,557
have got up to stretch myself.

112
00:05:48,158 --> 00:05:51,058
I turned slowly to the window,

113
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,059
as if to catch a little fresh air.

114
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,460
Wait, wait! What are you doing?

115
00:05:59,961 --> 00:06:01,661
I almost had him.

116
00:06:01,662 --> 00:06:03,962
But only the shoe remained in my hand.

117
00:06:05,563 --> 00:06:07,163
It is his escape by a whisker

118
00:06:07,164 --> 00:06:09,465
and only the shoe remained in the 
hands of Corporal Panessa.

119
00:06:09,866 --> 00:06:12,566
The four officials have failed...

120
00:06:12,567 --> 00:06:14,367
...and the anarchist Pinelli

121
00:06:15,168 --> 00:06:17,168
managed to reach the court.

122
00:06:18,769 --> 00:06:20,669
The body of the anarchist Pinelli was

123
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,670
found three meters away from the wall

124
00:06:22,771 --> 00:06:24,771
with both shoes on his feet.

00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,550
<i> It would have been extremely easy, </i>

176
00:08:47,551 --> 00:08:49,551
<i> and if they had wanted, </i>

177
00:08:49,552 --> 00:08:54,652
<i> I absolutely could 
not have prevented it. '"</i>

178
00:09:05,853 --> 00:09:07,403
VERSION Frezzi, the second!

179
00:09:11,704 --> 00:09:13,704
"The bombing of Milan"

180
00:09:14,404 --> 00:09:17,004
At the end of our work

181
00:09:17,005 --> 00:09:19,005
we want to recall on an episode

182
00:09:19,106 --> 00:09:21,106
from history of the labor movement.

183
00:09:24,807 --> 00:09:27,507
Pino Pinelli, who grew up 
with the anarchist myth

184
00:09:27,508 --> 00:09:30,508
of social justice and freedom,

185
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:34,809
certainly knew the drama 
of another anarchist:

186
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,910
Romeo Frezzi,

187
00:09:36,911 --> 00:09:41,011
accomplice arrested in 1897
as assassin of Umberto I.

188
00:09:41,012 --> 00:09:47,312
Frezzi was imprisoned as a victim
of delusional search for accomplices.

189
00:09:47,313 --> 00:09:50,413
The police headquarters has 
- after conflicting statements -

190
00:09:50,414 --> 00:09:52,814
explained that the man had killed himself,

191
00:09:52,915 --> 00:09:54,915
when he fell down from a 
balcony, 6 meters high.

192
00:09:55,716 --> 00:09:57,716
The autopsy, however,

193
00:09:57,817 --> 00:10:01,217
that took place thanks to the courage of the physician Dr. Pardo

194
00:10:01,418 --> 00:10:03,618
has shown that the man was killed.

195
00:10:05,219 --> 00:10:08,019
For the police it was an accident.

196
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,520
He did not want to talk

197
00:10:10,521 --> 00:10:12,421
and had absolutely nothing to say.

198
00:10:12,922 --> 00:10:15,022
And representatives of public safety

199
00:10:15,023 --> 00:10:17,123
have massacred him with blows.

200
00:10:17,124 --> 00:10:19,124
The anarchist Frezzi.

201
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:21,625
Frezzi! Speech! Speech!

202
00:10:21,926 --> 00:10:23,726
The Anarchists. The Anarchists.
The Anarchists.

203
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:28,827
We have killed him.

204
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:31,528
It was an accident.

205
00:10:32,629 --> 00:10:34,129
He killed himself.

206
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:37,330
It's true. He killed himself.

207
00:10:39,731 --> 00:10:41,331
He killed himself.

208
00:10:42,032 --> 00:10:43,932
He killed himself.

209
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,133
He killed himself.

210
00:10:46,534 --> 00:10:48,334
He killed himself.

211
00:10:57,035 --> 00:10:59,335
Pino Pinelli,

212
00:10:59,836 --> 00:11:03,136
last in a long line of anarchists,

213
00:11:03,237 --> 00:11:05,000
who killed themselves.
