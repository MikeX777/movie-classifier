00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,696
<i>Valentine's Day is two weeks away,
but Cupid is very busy.</i>

2
00:00:41,904 --> 00:00:44,499
<i>His arrow's struck Lynn Weaver...</i>

3
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:47,644
<i>...a talk-show host
worth $ 100 million...</i>

4
00:00:47,845 --> 00:00:51,611
<i>...whose popular program
has spawned a TV empire...</i>

5
00:00:51,816 --> 00:00:54,718
<i>...announced her marriage
this afternoon.</i>

6
00:00:54,919 --> 00:00:56,511
<i>The lucky groom-to-be...</i>

7
00:00:56,721 --> 00:01:00,557
<i>...is former NFL quarterback
and aging playboy Mike Gambril...</i>

8
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,456
<i>...who is a sportscaster
for NBC in Los Angeles.</i>

9
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:08,259
You look good
with your collar up like that.

10
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:10,493
<i>Mike, nice catch!</i>

11
00:01:25,487 --> 00:01:27,012
<i>Lynn Weaver and Mike Gambril...</i>

12
00:01:27,323 --> 00:01:30,315
<i>...the aging sports stud
and the popular talk-show host...</i>

13
00:01:30,526 --> 00:01:33,928
<i>...have everyone talking
about their engagement.</i>

14
00:01:43,842 --> 00:01:46,936
<i>Mike is a sportscaster
for an LA affiliate.</i>

15
00:01:47,245 --> 00:01:50,214
<i>But how he got that job
is the real news.</i>

16
00:01:50,415 --> 00:01:53,443
<i>Sources say Lynn got Mike the job...</i>

17
00:01:53,653 --> 00:01:56,213
<i>...but so far the quarterback
has been fumbling.</i>

18
00:01:56,423 --> 00:01:58,448
<i>If that doesn't
make her think twice...</i>

19
00:01:58,658 --> 00:02:02,094
<i>...there's Mike's reputation
for playing the field.</i>

20
00:02:02,295 --> 00:02:05,093
This is my favorite part.
I like this.

21
00:02:30,461 --> 00:02:32,588
<i>Who's standing
on the cake with her?</i>

22
00:02:32,797 --> 00:02:35,699
<i>One-time NFL backfield coach
Mike Gambril.</i>

23
00:02:35,901 --> 00:02:37,334
Perfect timing.

24
00:02:50,684 --> 00:02:53,244
When you get back from Australia...

25
00:02:53,454 --> 00:02:56,287
...we go in,
we renegotiate your deal.

26
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:58,856
Mike, what time is your flight?

27
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,569
Can I make a call?

28
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:12,707
People are batshit over you two
getting married. It's perfect.

29
00:03:12,908 --> 00:03:14,466
You're the lawyer.

30
00:03:14,677 --> 00:03:17,409
Don't hold me to it,
but in the next few weeks...

31
00:03:17,615 --> 00:03:20,344
...I can get in excess of $200,000.

32
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:24,920
If Lynn can get you on a Wednesday
night special, the sky's the limit.

33
00:03:25,123 --> 00:03:28,854
I mean, who's going to say no
to Lynn Weaver?

34
00:03:29,862 --> 00:03:32,559
Did you hear when I said
"the sky's the limit"?

35
00:03:33,465 --> 00:03:35,365
- You got a date?
- For what?

36
00:03:35,567 --> 00:03:36,762
The wedding.

37
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:39,336
The wedding!
We're getting there.

38
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:41,632
What do you mean?

39
00:03:41,841 --> 00:03:43,810
Don't louse this up for me.

40
00:03:44,011 --> 00:03:47,572
- Would I do that? Calm down.
- I am calm.

41
00:03:47,781 --> 00:03:51,718
I was thinking we should have it
on TV. Ever think of that?

42
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,820
I'm joking. I'm joking.

43
00:03:55,022 --> 00:03:58,516
I'm glad I caught you.
You forgot your watch.

44
00:03:58,728 --> 00:04:01,492
- I wondered where it was.
- The editing room.

45
00:04:01,697 --> 00:04:03,358
The editing room, yeah.

46
00:04:03,566 --> 00:04:05,158
Thanks.

47
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:09,529
- Safe trip.
- Bye. Thanks.

48
00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:13,006
- Who removes their watch in editing?
- I do.

49
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,734
Sweet. Very nice.

50
00:04:14,945 --> 00:04:17,141
What did she take off?

51
00:04:17,448 --> 00:04:19,848
Don't louse this up, huh?

52
00:04:42,176 --> 00:04:45,408
I'm telling you,
he's not on the flight.

53
00:04:45,614 --> 00:04:47,912
Wait, I see him.

54
00:04:48,116 --> 00:04:50,448
Don't worry, I'll get the picture.

55
00:04:50,652 --> 00:04:53,087
You'll get your
Lynn Weaver story.

56
00:04:53,289 --> 00:04:56,781
You wanted a picture of the tattoo
on Tom Arnold's ass.

57
00:04:56,993 --> 00:05:00,691
I got you a picture.
You think you can do better?

58
00:05:00,898 --> 00:05:03,593
- Mr. Gambril, welcome.
- I'll take those.

59
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,735
Thanks.

60
00:05:07,005 --> 00:05:11,237
<i>The flying time for the L.A. Leg
of our New York to Sydney flight...</i>

61
00:05:11,543 --> 00:05:14,069
<i>...should be 13 hours and 47 minutes.</i>

62
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,010
- What can I get you to drink?
- Only a pillow.

63
00:05:18,216 --> 00:05:22,655
<i>The temperature in Sydney should be
the same as it is here, 68 degrees.</i>

64
00:06:13,946 --> 00:06:15,972
Excuse me, I think that's my...

65
00:06:16,183 --> 00:06:17,981
I thought these things were extinct.

66
00:06:18,186 --> 00:06:20,517
Mike Gambril, what a thrill!

67
00:06:20,721 --> 00:06:23,122
I've been watching you sleep.
How are you?

68
00:06:23,325 --> 00:06:25,554
I've seen you play 1000 times.

69
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,320
I'm Herb Stillman.

70
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:30,531
This is my wife, Nora.

71
00:06:30,733 --> 00:06:32,667
She's a fan of yours, too.

72
00:06:32,868 --> 00:06:34,995
You've given us 1000 thrills!

73
00:06:35,204 --> 00:06:37,366
I'm glad you stopped coaching.

74
00:06:37,674 --> 00:06:39,641
I'm trying to watch the movie.

75
00:07:03,636 --> 00:07:05,331
Mike Gambril.

76
00:07:05,638 --> 00:07:07,799
Really? Hi. Terry.

77
00:07:08,007 --> 00:07:09,201
- How are you?
- Good.

78
00:07:09,409 --> 00:07:10,877
I'd like...

79
00:07:13,414 --> 00:07:16,646
It's true,
he's given me 1000 thrills.

80
00:07:16,852 --> 00:07:20,787
- But coaching is a thankless job.
- Herbie?

81
00:07:21,556 --> 00:07:23,889
- Herbie?
- Yes, Nora, sweetheart?

82
00:07:24,093 --> 00:07:24,991
Excuse me.

83
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:30,097
Can you help me? I can't figure out
23 across and 15 down.

84
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,668
I have an empty seat here.

85
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:40,277
You two can come up here
and sit beside each other. Come on.

86
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:42,742
Your son wouldn't have to...

87
00:07:42,947 --> 00:07:45,542
I hate to tell you,
but this is my grandson.

88
00:07:45,851 --> 00:07:47,716
It's Matthew.

89
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,113
Shake hands with Mike Gambril.

90
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,723
- Come on up here, I insist.
- Thank you very much.

91
00:08:01,735 --> 00:08:05,969
Did that look stupid? I know I looked
stupid. Was anyone watching?

92
00:08:09,143 --> 00:08:11,908
- No.
- Good.

93
00:08:12,114 --> 00:08:16,642
I must say, at my age 14 hours
is 14 hours, know what I mean?

94
00:08:16,852 --> 00:08:20,153
It's 14 hours of my life.

95
00:08:20,357 --> 00:08:23,985
We only have six more hours, but...

96
00:08:24,194 --> 00:08:27,164
I don't even know
what time zone I'm in.

97
00:08:27,364 --> 00:08:28,729
I took off from LA...

98
00:08:28,933 --> 00:08:31,026
...9000 miles to Sydney on Friday...

99
00:08:31,235 --> 00:08:33,727
...then back to New York
for the weekend...

100
00:08:33,939 --> 00:08:35,999
...and back to LA on Tuesday.

101
00:08:38,009 --> 00:08:41,502
- Can I help you?
- I'm sorry, I'm in the wrong place.

102
00:08:41,814 --> 00:08:45,215
Literally.
I'm up in the air all the time.

103
00:08:45,852 --> 00:08:48,947
You do that on any kind
of ongoing basis...

104
00:08:49,157 --> 00:08:50,487
...you become...

105
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:52,349
...completely...

106
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:54,824
- Disoriented?
- Disoriented.

107
00:08:55,029 --> 00:08:56,291
Disoriented.

108
00:08:56,498 --> 00:08:58,021
And... and...

109
00:08:59,434 --> 00:09:01,300
Isolated?

110
00:09:02,304 --> 00:09:03,702
Isolated, yeah.

111
00:09:03,906 --> 00:09:05,737
Isolated.

112
00:09:16,787 --> 00:09:19,312
How long are you gonna be in Sydney?

113
00:09:20,925 --> 00:09:22,153
Two days.

114
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,294
Two days!

115
00:09:24,495 --> 00:09:26,963
- Actually, two and a half.
- Me too.

116
00:09:27,164 --> 00:09:29,999
But I'm lucky, I don't travel
on an ongoing basis.

117
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:33,103
I don't worry
about feeling isolated.

118
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:39,171
That's good.

119
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:43,345
<i>This is your captain.
Please fasten your safety belts.</i>

120
00:09:43,552 --> 00:09:45,348
- Let me get that.
- No, I...

121
00:09:45,553 --> 00:09:48,250
- I'll get it.
- No, really, I...

122
00:09:48,456 --> 00:09:49,855
I'd rather...

123
00:09:51,326 --> 00:09:52,793
This will look fantastic.

124
00:09:52,994 --> 00:09:55,155
- Is that for a coat or a dress?
- A sailboat.

125
00:09:56,032 --> 00:09:57,898
A sailboat?

126
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:04,104
- Don't want to lose these.
- Thank you.

127
00:10:04,808 --> 00:10:08,005
All right. Here we go.

128
00:10:15,353 --> 00:10:18,084
- Good-looking guy.
- I think so.

129
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:19,551
Stockbroker?

130
00:10:19,857 --> 00:10:21,586
He's an investment banker.

131
00:10:21,893 --> 00:10:25,023
- What firm?
- Shearson Leahman.

132
00:10:25,231 --> 00:10:28,257
- Don't tell me he runs it.
- Actually, he does.

133
00:10:28,468 --> 00:10:30,629
What is he, 30, 35?

134
00:10:31,004 --> 00:10:32,870
He's young.

135
00:10:36,209 --> 00:10:38,270
- Amazing!
- What's that?

136
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,644
Memory loss is not necessarily
related to aging.

137
00:10:42,951 --> 00:10:44,179
- Memory loss?
- Absolutely.

138
00:10:44,386 --> 00:10:47,412
It's usually stress, change.
Change creates stress.

139
00:10:47,623 --> 00:10:50,091
The bigger the change,
the greater the stress.

140
00:10:50,293 --> 00:10:54,559
It must be overwhelming.
The mind is like a computer.

141
00:10:54,864 --> 00:10:57,993
It can only process so much
information before it farkles.

142
00:10:58,202 --> 00:11:01,433
- Farkles?
- Breaks down. Crashes.

143
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:04,905
Don't be embarrassed.
It's experience overload.

144
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:07,874
That's why you have a black book.

145
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:12,278
- What are we talking about?
- Us. You don't have a clue, do you?

146
00:11:12,485 --> 00:11:16,945
Don't be embarrassed. You've been
a very busy man for a long time.

147
00:11:17,156 --> 00:11:19,318
I'm a big girl.

148
00:11:20,594 --> 00:11:23,358
You look clammy. Are you all right?

149
00:11:25,499 --> 00:11:26,762
Me? I'm fine.

150
00:11:27,101 --> 00:11:31,664
Mike, it's no big deal. Not every
experience in life is memorable.

151
00:11:32,007 --> 00:11:34,998
You've been with many women.
It's understandable.

152
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,250
I hate root beer.
Come on, it's funny!

153
00:11:41,551 --> 00:11:44,951
What? To hear you call a wonderful
experience forgettable?

154
00:11:45,154 --> 00:11:46,646
What would you call it?

155
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:48,924
You didn't say anything,
so I didn't.

156
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,890
I'm not going to embarrass you.

157
00:11:52,096 --> 00:11:54,030
That's hilarious.

158
00:11:54,231 --> 00:11:57,359
One thing about me, I don't forget.

159
00:11:57,568 --> 00:11:59,058
I know when I forget something.

160
00:11:59,271 --> 00:12:03,139
If you know what you forgot,
you didn't forget it.

161
00:12:03,341 --> 00:12:07,073
<i>We've been experiencing trouble
with one of our engines.</i>

162
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,579
<i>Actually, two engines
on the right wing.</i>

163
00:12:10,783 --> 00:12:13,719
<i>We have to make
an unscheduled landing.</i>

164
00:12:14,021 --> 00:12:16,683
<i>There's a landing site
on a Cook Island atoll.</i>

165
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:20,552
<i>Attendants, please review
the emergency landing procedures.</i>

166
00:12:20,762 --> 00:12:23,423
<i>We should be on the ground
very shortly.</i>

167
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:26,327
He found an atoll.
We got a place to land.

168
00:12:26,534 --> 00:12:28,059
It's a sunken volcano.

169
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:30,101
He's got a place to land.

170
00:12:34,077 --> 00:12:38,240
There's nothing but water out there!
No lights, no land!

171
00:12:38,447 --> 00:12:42,112
They do this all the time
with coordinates and vectors.

172
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,288
With no engine on the right wing?

173
00:12:44,489 --> 00:12:47,322
He can land on one engine.

174
00:12:47,525 --> 00:12:48,993
It's fine.

175
00:12:49,194 --> 00:12:51,718
I spend my life on planes.
Don't worry.

176
00:13:18,827 --> 00:13:20,818
Let's hear it!
Let's hear it!

177
00:13:28,438 --> 00:13:31,066
- What?
- Excuse me.

178
00:13:42,253 --> 00:13:46,485
<i>As we're on a rather small landing
strip built during World War II...</i>

179
00:13:46,691 --> 00:13:51,926
<i>...there's no immediate possibility
of moving you by air from the island.</i>

180
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,599
<i>But we have three ships nearby...</i>

181
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:58,431
<i>...to ferry our passengers
to Fiji, Tahiti or Hawaii...</i>

182
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,803
<i>...one of which you can see moored
to our right.</i>

183
00:14:03,111 --> 00:14:06,807
<i>We'll help you make connections
from any of these airports.</i>

184
00:14:07,115 --> 00:14:08,844
<i>If you'll return to your seats...</i>

185
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:12,246
<i>...our flight attendants will
give you information.</i>

186
00:14:12,455 --> 00:14:14,183
<i>Thank you.</i>

187
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:16,653
Tahiti, Fiji or Hawaii?

188
00:14:16,861 --> 00:14:22,060
Go with what you know. I know Tahiti.
They're all 2 or 3 days away.

189
00:14:22,266 --> 00:14:23,460
Days?

190
00:14:23,667 --> 00:14:25,464
Forget Sydney for me.

191
00:14:25,669 --> 00:14:27,603
- Really?
- Yeah.

192
00:14:27,805 --> 00:14:30,900
I gotta call New York.
Do the ships have phones?

193
00:14:31,209 --> 00:14:34,144
- Sometimes.
- Really?

194
00:14:35,113 --> 00:14:37,742
Well... congratulations.

195
00:14:38,751 --> 00:14:40,945
- For what?
- Lynn Weaver.

196
00:14:41,152 --> 00:14:44,179
Tell her from me
she has a gallant fiancé.

197
00:14:44,391 --> 00:14:46,986
I know Hawaii, so have a nice trip.

198
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:49,626
Thank you. You, too.

199
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:53,195
Don't get too disoriented.

200
00:14:55,369 --> 00:15:00,104
Terry, I want you to read this
and give me your opinion.

201
00:15:36,516 --> 00:15:38,746
Chernobyl. That's good. Chernobyl.

202
00:15:38,952 --> 00:15:41,787
That cloud went around the earth.

203
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:44,423
Want hear a poem? Listen to this:

204
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:46,059
<i>Oh, Chernobyl cloud</i>

205
00:15:46,428 --> 00:15:49,226
<i>Chernobyl cloud
What did you do?</i>

206
00:15:49,431 --> 00:15:52,366
<i>Yesterday I had one head
Today I have two</i>

207
00:15:52,567 --> 00:15:55,800
Excuse me.
This boat does stop at Raiatea?

208
00:15:56,006 --> 00:15:58,838
Raiatea, Tangiroa,
Huahine and Morea.

209
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,909
- Is Raiatea the first stop?
- Can we talk?

210
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:04,772
I'd like to make a phone call
to Sydney.

211
00:16:04,982 --> 00:16:07,281
No telephone! Send telegram.

212
00:16:07,485 --> 00:16:08,816
How do I send one?

213
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:12,251
Form in stateroom.
Fill out. Hang on door.

214
00:16:12,457 --> 00:16:15,825
- Do you happen to have a form?
- Form in stateroom. Fill out!

215
00:16:16,028 --> 00:16:19,361
I understand! I'm asking nicely,
do you have a form?

216
00:16:19,565 --> 00:16:23,502
It's 5:30. If you don't go to bed...

217
00:16:23,703 --> 00:16:28,640
...we'll sleep all day tomorrow.
The toilet in my room doesn't flush!

218
00:16:29,543 --> 00:16:34,413
<i>Good morning, Miss McKay.
Welcome to our beautiful Belorussia.</i>

219
00:16:34,616 --> 00:16:36,481
You'll be in stateroom 21.

220
00:16:36,685 --> 00:16:38,015
What happened to Hawaii?

221
00:16:38,319 --> 00:16:39,787
It was another 4 hours.

222
00:16:39,988 --> 00:16:42,548
- That's terrible!
- I know.

223
00:16:42,758 --> 00:16:44,556
Where is the telephone?

224
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,024
There is none.
There's radiotelegraph.

225
00:16:47,329 --> 00:16:50,232
You fill out the form
and hang it on the door.

226
00:16:50,434 --> 00:16:53,460
Will you be sure Miss McKay's bags
go to her room?

227
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:56,400
- Excuse me.
- Oh, hello.

228
00:16:56,607 --> 00:16:58,473
Smooth.

229
00:17:01,011 --> 00:17:04,813
We can work our way around here.

230
00:17:05,017 --> 00:17:07,348
- Is this uncomfortable for you?
- What?

231
00:17:07,552 --> 00:17:09,077
Given our history and...

232
00:17:09,388 --> 00:17:12,846
I don't think we want
to give people the wrong idea.

233
00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:14,720
- Why ask for trouble?
- Right.

234
00:17:14,927 --> 00:17:17,692
- You do attract attention, you know.
- As do you.

235
00:17:17,899 --> 00:17:21,095
- And very deservedly, I might add.
- Thank you.

236
00:17:21,401 --> 00:17:25,634
But I'm nothing if not discreet.
That's common knowledge.

237
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:30,278
If it were, you wouldn't be discreet.
I'm fine with our history.

238
00:17:30,479 --> 00:17:32,471
Thank you.

239
00:17:32,682 --> 00:17:36,447
- You know what it is? Your hair.
- Longer.

240
00:17:36,652 --> 00:17:39,053
- It was a lot longer.
- Now it's longer.

241
00:17:39,355 --> 00:17:42,324
That's what I mean.
But there's more red in it.

242
00:17:42,525 --> 00:17:45,393
- Not really.
- No, not really.

243
00:17:45,596 --> 00:17:48,224
It probably looks more red
because it's longer.

244
00:17:48,499 --> 00:17:52,800
But that's not how I get a sense
of someone. This is my room.

245
00:17:53,004 --> 00:17:54,937
There's 21.

246
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:02,973
Mike, you were nice on the plane.

247
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:04,977
You serious?

248
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:07,775
Let me ask you,
when you think about us...

249
00:18:07,987 --> 00:18:10,319
...what do you remember most?

250
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:12,083
We only saw each other once.

251
00:18:12,393 --> 00:18:15,725
You tripped on a bag
in front of a hotel as I got a cab.

252
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:17,397
We never met.

253
00:18:21,503 --> 00:18:22,731
Beautiful luggage.

254
00:18:22,937 --> 00:18:24,495
I do have a weakness for nice things.

255
00:18:24,707 --> 00:18:26,767
Me, too. Nice things are nice.

256
00:18:26,977 --> 00:18:29,638
Better get to work
on those telegrams.

257
00:20:25,042 --> 00:20:27,738
He says, it's honor
to have you all aboard.

258
00:20:27,945 --> 00:20:32,474
That we are proud to offer help
in moment of crisis.

259
00:20:32,684 --> 00:20:34,983
- We love Americans.
- Watch.

260
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:43,230
We were in Hawaii last year...

261
00:20:43,531 --> 00:20:45,794
...at the same hotel as Alex Trebeck.

262
00:20:45,999 --> 00:20:48,992
- Really?
- Don't drink the water.

263
00:20:49,537 --> 00:20:51,164
Hey, the coach is here!

264
00:20:51,472 --> 00:20:53,497
Mr. Gambril, I'm the captain.

265
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:56,644
On behalf of captain,
welcome to our happy table.

266
00:20:56,845 --> 00:20:58,677
- Herb, Nora.
- And you know...

267
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:00,576
We met briefly.

268
00:21:00,783 --> 00:21:02,945
- Miss...?
- McKay.

269
00:21:03,753 --> 00:21:06,585
- Nice to see you again.
- Certainly nice to see you again.

270
00:21:06,789 --> 00:21:10,659
Please, sit there.

271
00:21:10,861 --> 00:21:13,591
Over there is good, too.

272
00:21:14,699 --> 00:21:15,996
Wally Tripp.

273
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,692
Good to meet you.

274
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,705
Radiotelegram.

275
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:20,105
If you don't make a friend of TV
it exploits your misery.

276
00:22:20,273 --> 00:22:25,734
You're miserable, you watch TV,
you escape, you see more misery.

277
00:22:25,946 --> 00:22:29,108
- Violence, war...
- I tell you, TV has been good to me.

278
00:22:29,282 --> 00:22:31,945
Mike, you're in local TV now, right?

279
00:22:32,153 --> 00:22:34,588
You have to make a friend
of television.

280
00:22:50,674 --> 00:22:52,665
$ 75?

281
00:22:59,984 --> 00:23:03,113
Small school, tiny school,
no money, no bucks.

282
00:23:05,991 --> 00:23:08,425
How do you say, "You can be great?"

283
00:23:08,727 --> 00:23:12,219
- What's the toughest thing?
- Getting them to listen?

284
00:23:12,431 --> 00:23:15,027
- Or getting them to think?
- The great ones don't.

285
00:23:15,236 --> 00:23:17,635
What do you mean?

286
00:23:17,838 --> 00:23:21,172
They react.
They don't have to think.

287
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:23,366
What're you talking about?

288
00:23:23,678 --> 00:23:28,013
Are you saying a football player
is greater if he doesn't think?

289
00:23:30,787 --> 00:23:32,185
I like watching you move.

290
00:23:34,657 --> 00:23:36,648
Excuse me.

291
00:23:38,927 --> 00:23:41,397
Basically, I'm in TV, too, now.

292
00:23:53,277 --> 00:23:54,836
Hey, you.

293
00:23:55,047 --> 00:23:56,344
Hi, how are you?

294
00:23:57,884 --> 00:24:01,479
See the heavyset guy at the bar
with a camera?

295
00:24:01,787 --> 00:24:05,279
He was traumatized by the landing
last night. He's so sweet.

296
00:24:05,491 --> 00:24:08,153
I couldn't even get him
to come to the table.

297
00:24:08,361 --> 00:24:10,058
- I can do that.
- Would you?

298
00:24:10,265 --> 00:24:11,664
I'll do that for you.

299
00:24:11,866 --> 00:24:14,300
That's so nice of you.

300
00:25:00,054 --> 00:25:01,281
What are you doing?

301
00:25:02,088 --> 00:25:03,522
Watching you move.

302
00:25:14,903 --> 00:25:17,965
I saw what was going on
with you and the captain.

303
00:25:18,175 --> 00:25:22,168
I'm not gonna put up with it
another moment, understand me?

304
00:25:22,379 --> 00:25:25,439
They may be pretty faces,
but they're shallow.

305
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:27,940
Thank you, dear, I just...

306
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:30,915
I needed to hear you say that.

307
00:25:31,121 --> 00:25:33,921
Did she fall for it?

308
00:25:34,126 --> 00:25:38,392
The silly story of the plane going
down and moving to a Russian ship.

309
00:25:38,597 --> 00:25:40,929
She doesn't ask a lot of questions.

310
00:25:41,133 --> 00:25:43,294
- Is that good?
- I think so.

311
00:25:44,303 --> 00:25:45,601
You don't play around, do you?

312
00:25:45,905 --> 00:25:50,899
No, but I think I might have to if
I were involved with someone like you.

313
00:25:51,111 --> 00:25:54,343
But you wouldn't.
You're way too fussy.

314
00:25:56,016 --> 00:25:57,848
- Fussy?
- Cautious.

315
00:25:58,052 --> 00:25:59,850
Playing around is like this.

316
00:26:00,055 --> 00:26:03,889
Too much is bad for you,
but a little raises the HDLs.

317
00:26:04,092 --> 00:26:06,425
- HDLs?
- Good for the heart.

318
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:09,161
Is it?

319
00:26:10,833 --> 00:26:13,200
I think that might be
difficult for you.

320
00:26:13,404 --> 00:26:15,269
Is that so?

321
00:26:16,473 --> 00:26:18,998
It might be.

322
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:28,317
But you can get a little wet,
even if you're fussy.

323
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:30,454
Miss McKay.

324
00:26:30,656 --> 00:26:32,590
Radiotelegram.

325
00:26:36,363 --> 00:26:38,421
I'll be right back.

326
00:26:58,253 --> 00:27:02,384
Alka-Seltzer, for headache.
My wife has a headache.

327
00:27:26,619 --> 00:27:28,519
It's me.

328
00:27:28,721 --> 00:27:30,383
It's me.

329
00:27:30,591 --> 00:27:32,285
Hello, honey.

330
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,034
- She was drunk.
- You're drunk.

331
00:27:46,241 --> 00:27:48,106
- I'm not drunk!
- I see you're drunk.

332
00:27:48,309 --> 00:27:51,371
- You're at the bar, flirting.
- I do not flirt!

333
00:27:51,581 --> 00:27:52,808
You do flirt!

334
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:06,691
You gonna marry him?

335
00:28:09,034 --> 00:28:11,559
Forget that.

336
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:13,397
What do you mean, a sailboat?

337
00:28:17,744 --> 00:28:20,474
A coat or a dress I can understand.

338
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,047
But a sailboat?

339
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:26,515
That's what I'm doing in Sydney.
I'm decorating a sailboat.

340
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,746
- A red one.
- You're a decorator?

341
00:28:31,493 --> 00:28:33,394
I'm a musician.

342
00:28:34,396 --> 00:28:37,058
What do you play?

343
00:28:37,265 --> 00:28:40,064
Piano, I guess.
I don't know. I teach it.

344
00:28:40,269 --> 00:28:44,070
But I also write songs and I sing.

345
00:28:44,274 --> 00:28:46,640
You sure sound like you sing.

346
00:28:46,844 --> 00:28:50,610
Yeah, I sing.
I'm big. I'm very big.

347
00:28:50,814 --> 00:28:54,580
Ray Charles sings, "You got the right
one" and someone goes, "Uh-huh"...

348
00:28:54,785 --> 00:28:57,482
...in certain South American
countries, that's me.

349
00:28:57,689 --> 00:29:01,420
Also, I have dabbled in waitressing...

350
00:29:01,626 --> 00:29:05,358
...but at the apex of my music career
and my food service career...

351
00:29:05,564 --> 00:29:09,625
...I met a man and I helped him
decorate his apartment in New York.

352
00:29:09,835 --> 00:29:13,568
Then I decorated his Hampton house
and his house in Palm Beach.

353
00:29:13,774 --> 00:29:17,266
Then I decorated his apartment
in Sydney.

354
00:29:20,281 --> 00:29:22,545
If his acquisition
of Virgin succeeds...

355
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:26,016
...I'm sure I'll decorate something
in London.

356
00:29:26,221 --> 00:29:29,088
But at the moment, it's a sailboat.

357
00:29:29,291 --> 00:29:31,156
It's red. It's nice.

358
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:39,365
- You gonna marry him?
- Yeah, I guess. I hope so.

359
00:29:41,172 --> 00:29:43,639
I'm madly in love with him.

360
00:29:49,281 --> 00:29:51,078
What?

361
00:29:53,686 --> 00:29:55,415
Come here.

362
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,874
All right?

363
00:30:49,182 --> 00:30:51,742
- I really should go.
- No, don't.

364
00:30:51,951 --> 00:30:54,317
I think so. I think so.

365
00:30:54,521 --> 00:30:56,785
- Don't think.
- Right.

366
00:30:56,991 --> 00:30:59,551
The great ones don't, huh?

367
00:31:13,708 --> 00:31:16,304
- How you doing?
- How are you?

368
00:32:53,323 --> 00:32:55,257
I'd like to send the lady a drink.

369
00:32:55,457 --> 00:32:59,292
A glass of tomato juice, two raw eggs
and a shot of vinegar.

370
00:33:14,346 --> 00:33:16,108
About last night...

371
00:33:16,414 --> 00:33:18,644
Listen...

372
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:22,413
You don't want to mess up your life
any more than I do mine.

373
00:33:24,924 --> 00:33:27,325
Well...

374
00:33:27,528 --> 00:33:32,830
You can get a small plane tonight
to Tahiti, then to Sydney.

375
00:33:34,502 --> 00:33:39,269
This boat will take two days to reach
an airport. You can get there tonight.

376
00:33:42,945 --> 00:33:44,639
I'm gonna run along.

377
00:33:44,846 --> 00:33:47,078
Big shuffleboard game?

378
00:33:47,384 --> 00:33:50,876
As a matter of fact, I know a woman
who lives on the next island.

379
00:33:51,087 --> 00:33:52,850
I'm shocked and amazed.

380
00:33:53,056 --> 00:33:55,081
She's amazing. Want to come?

381
00:33:55,393 --> 00:33:58,088
Do you feel you need a chaperon?

382
00:33:58,395 --> 00:34:01,525
- She's my aunt.
- Your aunt?

383
00:34:02,501 --> 00:34:07,632
A couple hours with a guy and his
aunt... Meet me in 20 minutes.

384
00:34:27,661 --> 00:34:29,654
Do you have an aunt on every island?

385
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:46,544
Your aunt?

386
00:34:48,285 --> 00:34:49,149
Sure.

387
00:35:56,962 --> 00:35:58,931
Oh, ducks!

388
00:36:02,569 --> 00:36:04,196
Out! Go on.

389
00:36:04,504 --> 00:36:06,598
Holy Moses! Get!

390
00:36:09,143 --> 00:36:13,308
For God's sake, Michael!
What are you doing here?

391
00:36:13,615 --> 00:36:17,574
- You're the only restaurant in town.
- This is a surprise.

392
00:36:17,786 --> 00:36:22,156
She's a surprise, too.
You, her, what a surprise.

393
00:36:22,759 --> 00:36:26,195
You certainly have got yourself
a handful.

394
00:36:26,796 --> 00:36:28,628
Actually, no, I don't.

395
00:36:28,832 --> 00:36:33,498
He's got the handful? Good.
Very good. It's about time.

396
00:36:33,705 --> 00:36:34,967
I like that.

397
00:36:35,173 --> 00:36:37,505
You've got the wrong girl.

398
00:36:37,709 --> 00:36:42,044
I say, you're a knockout in person
and look so much younger.

399
00:36:42,248 --> 00:36:45,307
Do they make you up on television?

400
00:36:45,617 --> 00:36:47,610
This is not Lynn,
this is Terry McKay.

401
00:36:47,821 --> 00:36:52,690
We were on a plane together and
we had to land on the islands and...

402
00:36:52,893 --> 00:36:54,520
Why were you
on a plane together?

403
00:36:54,728 --> 00:36:56,593
- We were going to Australia.
- We're friends.

404
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:58,560
This isn't Lynn.

405
00:36:58,766 --> 00:36:59,734
Friends?

406
00:36:59,934 --> 00:37:02,870
- This isn't the girl you'll marry?
- No.

407
00:37:04,606 --> 00:37:06,336
Well...

408
00:37:06,642 --> 00:37:10,634
- We gotta be back on the boat by 5.
- It's nice to meet you.

409
00:37:10,845 --> 00:37:12,939
Friends?

410
00:37:13,149 --> 00:37:16,279
Rau, come and look who's here.

411
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,187
So...

412
00:37:24,394 --> 00:37:25,885
Well...

413
00:37:31,336 --> 00:37:33,827
How's the new job?

414
00:37:35,073 --> 00:37:38,600
How is it? Is it fun?

415
00:37:39,077 --> 00:37:42,742
Is it satisfying, at least?

416
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:45,316
Say no more. Say no more.

417
00:37:45,619 --> 00:37:48,782
Eloquent, isn't he?
A born broadcaster.

418
00:37:51,259 --> 00:37:53,886
How are you doing?

419
00:37:54,094 --> 00:37:56,155
This is Rau. Terry McKay.

420
00:37:56,365 --> 00:37:59,891
- Look at you! How big he is!
- Come see the little one.

421
00:38:00,102 --> 00:38:02,730
We're going to see the baby.
Be right back.

422
00:38:02,939 --> 00:38:05,635
What do you think of your brother?

423
00:38:18,889 --> 00:38:23,328
Tell me, as a friend, what do you
think of Michael's fiancée?

424
00:38:25,131 --> 00:38:27,690
Well, we just met, Mike and I.

425
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:31,200
- You're a new friend?
- I haven't met Lynn.

426
00:38:31,404 --> 00:38:34,896
Neither have I, as I'm sure
you've gathered by now.

427
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,711
- Are you in broadcasting?
- No.

428
00:38:42,917 --> 00:38:46,853
- What do you do?
- Music.

429
00:38:47,822 --> 00:38:49,985
- Music?
- Music.

430
00:38:56,699 --> 00:38:58,759
Your house is beautiful.

431
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:01,129
It's rather nice.

432
00:39:01,337 --> 00:39:04,172
I'd never leave here.

433
00:39:10,248 --> 00:39:13,945
I hope you don't feel awkward
being here with Michael...

434
00:39:14,152 --> 00:39:15,710
...when he's engaged.

435
00:39:17,122 --> 00:39:20,116
I'm engaged myself.

436
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:25,862
Are you happy?

437
00:39:27,034 --> 00:39:29,332
I'd better be.
I have everything I want.

438
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:32,700
- That's what Michael says.
- Why do you think he's wrong?

439
00:39:32,908 --> 00:39:35,239
I didn't say he was wrong.

440
00:39:35,443 --> 00:39:37,434
Naive, maybe.

441
00:39:37,746 --> 00:39:40,772
The trick in life isn't
getting what you want...

442
00:39:40,983 --> 00:39:43,213
...it's wanting it after you get it.

443
00:39:43,419 --> 00:39:46,912
For people like you and Michael,
the getting is easy.

444
00:39:47,123 --> 00:39:49,250
Would you like something to eat?

445
00:39:49,459 --> 00:39:52,486
Thanks, but don't go to any trouble.

446
00:39:52,797 --> 00:39:54,890
No, it's no trouble at all.

447
00:40:05,243 --> 00:40:08,839
Your horses are beautiful.
They seem devoted.

448
00:40:09,047 --> 00:40:13,884
Bernard and Sophie? They're devoted,
but then they're stuck on an island.

449
00:40:15,855 --> 00:40:18,916
Horses are not monogamous.

450
00:40:19,893 --> 00:40:22,590
I made this tea cake yesterday.

451
00:40:22,896 --> 00:40:25,126
Could you slice it for me, please?

452
00:40:25,332 --> 00:40:26,961
Swans, of course, are.

453
00:40:27,169 --> 00:40:30,035
- Are what?
- Monogamous.

454
00:40:30,238 --> 00:40:32,799
- They are?
- Unremittingly.

455
00:40:33,009 --> 00:40:35,307
You make them sound almost boring.

456
00:40:35,511 --> 00:40:37,877
- I mean...
- I know what you mean.

457
00:40:38,514 --> 00:40:42,111
- Roosters?
- Not monogamous.

458
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,116
You've heard?

459
00:40:44,321 --> 00:40:48,816
- Do you find them boring?
- Depends on the rooster.

460
00:40:49,027 --> 00:40:51,085
What about ducks?

461
00:40:51,295 --> 00:40:53,024
What about ducks?

462
00:40:53,231 --> 00:40:58,864
They're worse. They're promiscuous,
and they are terribly indiscreet.

463
00:40:59,071 --> 00:41:03,099
- I try not to make judgements.
- About what?

464
00:41:03,309 --> 00:41:05,834
About whether or not
somebody wants to...

465
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:08,641
...if you'll excuse the expression...

466
00:41:09,583 --> 00:41:11,915
...fuck a duck.

467
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:15,384
Please don't misunderstand.
I'm not recommending it.

468
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:19,582
But I don't necessarily view it
as a moral failure.

469
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:23,127
No. I mean, no.
How long were you married?

470
00:41:23,332 --> 00:41:27,393
Dearie, I am married,
although he died 12 years ago.

471
00:41:27,603 --> 00:41:29,935
I am married.

472
00:41:32,675 --> 00:41:34,575
Haven't we forgotten something?

473
00:41:34,877 --> 00:41:36,904
Yes. Forks.

474
00:41:37,115 --> 00:41:39,639
If I'd known
I was going to live to 86...

475
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:42,613
...I wouldn't have let the maid go.

476
00:41:43,688 --> 00:41:45,316
You like it?

477
00:41:45,523 --> 00:41:47,514
Very much.

478
00:41:47,726 --> 00:41:50,196
Michael did it.

479
00:41:53,099 --> 00:41:56,866
- Back when he played football.
- Does he still paint?

480
00:41:57,070 --> 00:42:00,130
I don't think so.
I doubt he has the time.

481
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:02,399
He's so busy...

482
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:05,375
...in other places...

483
00:42:05,581 --> 00:42:08,344
...pursuing other things...

484
00:42:08,549 --> 00:42:11,075
...if you'll excuse the expression...

485
00:42:11,286 --> 00:42:13,617
...other ducks.

486
00:42:16,225 --> 00:42:18,490
Other ducks.

487
00:42:25,269 --> 00:42:28,032
But I'm not sure Michael is a duck.

488
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:31,575
He does a pretty good
imitation of one.

489
00:42:31,777 --> 00:42:34,109
Sometimes I feel he's desperate.

490
00:42:34,312 --> 00:42:36,746
Impostors are usually
desperate to behave...

491
00:42:37,048 --> 00:42:39,108
...like what they know they're not.

492
00:42:39,318 --> 00:42:40,579
But as a duck...

493
00:42:40,786 --> 00:42:45,225
...I have no doubt he's very credible
and highly energetic.

494
00:42:47,527 --> 00:42:50,520
You're worried about him?

495
00:42:50,731 --> 00:42:53,758
I didn't say I was worried about him.

496
00:42:54,068 --> 00:42:57,559
I hope you won't turn out to be
one of those irritating women...

497
00:42:57,772 --> 00:43:01,139
...who think they can read minds.

498
00:43:04,246 --> 00:43:06,111
Okay. I'm worried.

499
00:43:06,715 --> 00:43:07,704
Why?

500
00:43:08,016 --> 00:43:09,678
I just...

501
00:43:09,985 --> 00:43:12,784
I just want him to have what I had.

502
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:16,991
I've been lucky.
I always knew what I wanted.

503
00:43:17,194 --> 00:43:19,720
He's settling down, isn't he?

504
00:43:24,035 --> 00:43:29,269
Michael may just be the ugly duckling
who doesn't know he's a swan.

505
00:43:29,474 --> 00:43:34,105
He thinks he's a duck. He'll probably
continue to behave like a duck...

506
00:43:34,314 --> 00:43:37,111
...until he finds another swan.

507
00:43:38,218 --> 00:43:41,620
Maybe he's found one.

508
00:43:47,295 --> 00:43:50,195
I'm quite sure he's found one.

509
00:45:39,587 --> 00:45:42,148
Five o'clock.

510
00:45:42,358 --> 00:45:46,194
- You must go?
- Yes.

511
00:45:48,598 --> 00:45:50,590
- May I...?
- Thank you.

512
00:45:50,801 --> 00:45:52,826
Thank you.

513
00:45:57,743 --> 00:45:59,735
I wore this when I was married.

514
00:45:59,946 --> 00:46:01,344
Beautiful.

515
00:46:02,381 --> 00:46:04,680
Well, off you go.

516
00:46:09,288 --> 00:46:12,816
These petals are
supposedly the hands...

517
00:46:13,027 --> 00:46:15,518
...of a Polynesian princess.

518
00:46:15,729 --> 00:46:18,391
It's been hanging around
for 62 years...

519
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:20,591
...and it's still holding together.

520
00:46:20,801 --> 00:46:24,534
I wish I could say
the same for myself.

521
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:32,675
We'll see you soon.
