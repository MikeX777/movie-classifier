1
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:35,655
(Grinding)

2
00:01:28,574 --> 00:01:33,479
(slow piano music)

3
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,202
- [Voiceover] I've come to
realize that my whole existence

4
00:01:56,202 --> 00:01:58,838
from the age of 13 on has been

5
00:01:58,838 --> 00:02:03,409
about crisis. A crisis
 of metamorphosis.

6
00:02:04,343 --> 00:02:05,878
I've always been aware that I've

7
00:02:05,878 --> 00:02:07,613
been in the process of changing,

8
00:02:07,613 --> 00:02:10,383
I just never know until why.

9
00:02:12,051 --> 00:02:15,321
Now with the cancer
 sucking the life out of me,

10
00:02:16,756 --> 00:02:18,691
doesn't seem likely
 that I'll ever find

11
00:02:18,691 --> 00:02:21,260
the final form my life
 is supposed to take.

12
00:02:22,361 --> 00:02:27,333
(fire crackles)

13
00:02:31,971 --> 00:02:34,807
I wash in the noise of
 memory and morphine.

14
00:02:36,108 --> 00:02:38,878
I find myself unable
 to project myself into

15
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:42,215
a future that is
 increasingly finite.

16
00:02:54,193 --> 00:02:56,896
Now with the funding for
  my movie having collapsed,

17
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,931
along with the rest
 of the economy,

18
00:03:00,132 --> 00:03:02,235
all that's left for me to do is

19
00:03:03,736 --> 00:03:08,074
reflect on a project and a
  life I'll never complete.

20
00:04:26,619 --> 00:04:28,287
I've come to the
  conclusion that my

21
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:31,123
childhood memories are not real.

22
00:04:31,123 --> 00:04:33,960
Though manufactured for
me is a kind of fiction

23
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,730
framed by the adults who were
 present when I was young.

24
00:04:39,231 --> 00:04:43,336
And these good natured people,
 friends, relatives, all,

25
00:04:44,437 --> 00:04:46,072
continually repeated the same

26
00:04:46,072 --> 00:04:48,040
stories and anecdotes about me.

27
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:51,644
Often reinforcing
  their tales with

28
00:04:51,644 --> 00:04:54,180
photographic and video evidence.

29
00:04:55,581 --> 00:04:57,850
And because consciousness
  is malleable

30
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:02,188
and memory a clever
 liar, the substance,

31
00:05:03,723 --> 00:05:07,059
the true reality of who
I was had been lost.

32
00:05:09,495 --> 00:05:12,598
The time in maturity
 I've come to think of

33
00:05:12,598 --> 00:05:16,202
my past selves as distant others

34
00:05:18,337 --> 00:05:22,174
with their own needs
 and motivations,

35
00:05:23,776 --> 00:05:26,946
not like characters
 in a novel or a movie.

36
00:05:28,114 --> 00:05:31,150
How fitting then that I
spent an entire career

37
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:34,920
exploring my own existence
 in the creation of fiction.

38
00:05:38,891 --> 00:05:41,293
My first film "Disquiet" was a

39
00:05:41,293 --> 00:05:45,664
dramatic investigation into
 the very nature of character.

40
00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:49,068
How it's defined and observed.

41
00:05:52,571 --> 00:05:55,274
Now, as I struggle
 with the unfortunate

42
00:05:55,274 --> 00:05:57,777
reality of my
 terminal condition,

43
00:05:57,777 --> 00:06:01,247
I wonder about the
  young man I once

44
00:06:01,247 --> 00:06:03,816
was twenty some odd years ago.

45
00:06:06,185 --> 00:06:09,355
Not as a memory but as a, as a

46
00:06:09,355 --> 00:06:12,591
character completely
 separate from myself.

47
00:06:15,428 --> 00:06:19,064
My thoughts focus not so much on

48
00:06:20,299 --> 00:06:23,903
on past events, but on attitudes

49
00:06:23,903 --> 00:06:28,541
and motivations,
  needs and desires.

50
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:34,647
All in an effort to find how
much of him is still within me.

51
00:06:40,085 --> 00:06:42,521
But is this a hollow pursuit?

52
00:06:45,057 --> 00:06:47,660
Can one ever truly know
the man he once was?

53
00:06:51,764 --> 00:06:54,567
(groans)

54
00:06:54,567 --> 00:06:58,637
Oh, fuck! Oh God!

55
00:07:02,274 --> 00:07:06,445
(heaving)

56
00:07:24,096 --> 00:07:28,501
Interior. Theater. Day.

57
00:07:30,536 --> 00:07:35,541
Scene 13. An acting
 class in progress.

58
00:07:36,275 --> 00:07:38,177
(Latin percussion music)

59
00:07:38,177 --> 00:07:40,513
The sound of Latin
  percussions fill the space

60
00:07:40,513 --> 00:07:43,782
as a capoeirista
  performs on stage

61
00:07:43,782 --> 00:07:46,318
before twenty young students
 sitting in the audience.

62
00:07:46,318 --> 00:07:49,288
- The rhythmic movement
back and forth.

63
00:07:49,288 --> 00:07:51,357
Got to keep your hands
 in front of your face

64
00:07:51,357 --> 00:07:53,792
in case you get a
 foot coming at you.

65
00:07:53,792 --> 00:07:57,129
If you do it from this side
 you might come down here

66
00:07:57,129 --> 00:08:00,866
and back up, and
 strike with your foot.

67
00:08:02,034 --> 00:08:05,337
The whole time you float
back into the Ginga.

68
00:08:05,337 --> 00:08:07,573
This is the basis of capoeira.

69
00:08:09,341 --> 00:08:12,545
Then you start getting
  into movements like this.

70
00:08:12,545 --> 00:08:15,681
And you might try to fake
  them and then kick high.

71
00:08:17,049 --> 00:08:21,186
The whole time you're
 making it look like a dance.

72
00:08:21,186 --> 00:08:23,756
You see the slaves in
 Brazil weren't allowed

73
00:08:23,756 --> 00:08:26,692
to train in fighting,
 so they had to make

74
00:08:26,692 --> 00:08:30,829
this look like a ritualistic
 dance and they had

75
00:08:30,829 --> 00:08:35,701
chains on their hands
so i'm blocking my face

76
00:08:35,701 --> 00:08:38,704
like that but you see
the hands stay together.

77
00:08:50,549 --> 00:08:52,251
(music stops)

78
00:09:02,795 --> 00:09:06,165
You know each time Sam
 came home from Iraq

79
00:09:08,033 --> 00:09:10,202
something about him changed.

80
00:09:12,538 --> 00:09:14,473
I could barely put
  my finger on it

81
00:09:14,473 --> 00:09:16,375
and neither could our friends.

82
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:22,047
It was something...
 subtle. Barely perceptible.

83
00:09:26,385 --> 00:09:29,788
We used to play capoeira
together in Central Park

84
00:09:29,788 --> 00:09:33,959
and had plans to do so the
  last time he came home.

85
00:09:36,495 --> 00:09:39,098
But then he called
 me the night before

86
00:09:39,098 --> 00:09:41,400
and told me he
 wouldn't be coming.

87
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,702
And he wouldn't tell me why.

88
00:09:46,572 --> 00:09:50,142
I pressed him and
  he finally said

89
00:09:51,677 --> 00:09:54,747
he was afraid he
 might hurt somebody.

90
00:09:57,683 --> 00:10:02,588
Now as you just saw, capoeira
 really isn't even combat.

91
00:10:02,588 --> 00:10:04,657
There isn't even
  much contact, it's

92
00:10:04,657 --> 00:10:07,359
more dance than anything else.

93
00:10:07,359 --> 00:10:10,929
So when he said
 that, I realized that

94
00:10:10,929 --> 00:10:14,833
it wasn't just us who
 knew he had changed.

95
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:18,170
But deep down, Sam
  knew it himself.

96
00:10:21,774 --> 00:10:26,345
He no longer trusted himself
 not to hurt his friends.

97
00:10:32,718 --> 00:10:37,723
It pains me to say
 this, but I'm afraid

98
00:10:38,857 --> 00:10:42,361
the next time he
 comes home on leave,

99
00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:47,099
he'll have changed so much I
 won't even know him anymore.

100
00:10:54,373 --> 00:10:59,044
I'll have lost my best friend.

101
00:11:01,346 --> 00:11:06,051
(applause)

102
00:11:06,051 --> 00:11:09,254
- Well done, Sergio.
 Seth, you're up.

103
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:30,375
(piano music)

104
00:11:33,579 --> 00:11:38,584
♪♪

105
00:11:52,798 --> 00:11:56,135
- This is my father's
 favorite piece.

106
00:11:56,135 --> 00:12:00,172
I learned it in high school
 for the sake of pleasing him.

107
00:12:00,172 --> 00:12:03,075
I was never the son
 my father wanted.

108
00:12:03,075 --> 00:12:08,080
That, is my brother Andrew.
 He was the athletic one.

109
00:12:09,515 --> 00:12:11,984
The popular kid
 with charm to spare.

110
00:12:13,418 --> 00:12:15,254
I was too much the mama's boy,

111
00:12:15,254 --> 00:12:18,190
the piano player,
 the singer and actor.

112
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,562
But dad loved this piece.

113
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:26,832
And sometimes I think
 this piece of music

114
00:12:26,832 --> 00:12:30,202
was the only real connection
 we had as father and son.

115
00:12:37,976 --> 00:12:40,779
(music stops)

116
00:12:40,779 --> 00:12:43,348
When the war in Iraq began, my

117
00:12:43,348 --> 00:12:45,517
parents thought it
  was a just fight.

118
00:12:46,685 --> 00:12:48,287
They thought toppling
 Saddam Hussein would

119
00:12:48,287 --> 00:12:52,457
be good for America
 and good for Israel.

120
00:12:52,457 --> 00:12:54,693
I disagreed loudly.

121
00:12:56,295 --> 00:13:00,265
Andrew, on the other hand,
  sided with my parents.

122
00:13:01,466 --> 00:13:03,302
And he even joined
  the marines so he

123
00:13:03,302 --> 00:13:05,437
could get in the
  war on terrorism.

124
00:13:08,507 --> 00:13:11,443
I thought to
 myself, at least one

125
00:13:11,443 --> 00:13:13,812
of us would make
  our father proud.

126
00:13:20,686 --> 00:13:24,022
(piano plays) I remember
 when he came home on leave.

127
00:13:24,022 --> 00:13:26,358
They finally shipped
 him off to Iraq.

128
00:13:28,126 --> 00:13:29,962
Our family and
 neighbors beamed at

129
00:13:29,962 --> 00:13:31,930
Private Wiseman who
proudly wore his uniform

130
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:34,266
on the front porch
 for everybody to see.

131
00:13:36,902 --> 00:13:39,872
That was the last
  time I saw him.

132
00:13:41,073 --> 00:13:44,476
Nearly four months
 later, he was dead.

133
00:13:50,182 --> 00:13:52,351
(music stops)

134
00:13:52,351 --> 00:13:54,720
That's when the music stopped.

135
00:13:59,358 --> 00:14:02,427
A son that is followed
 at home like a shroud,

136
00:14:03,862 --> 00:14:07,099
my father no asked me to
  play Mendelssohn for him.

137
00:14:08,467 --> 00:14:11,069
We no longer watched
  television at dinner time.

138
00:14:12,237 --> 00:14:14,539
Gone are the politics
 or the discussions.

139
00:14:16,808 --> 00:14:19,578
Sometimes I think he can't
  even bare to look at me.

140
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:28,921
I've come to realize that
  I'm no longer his son.

141
00:14:30,222 --> 00:14:33,392
I'm merely the
  child who remains.

142
00:14:34,526 --> 00:14:39,531
(applause)

143
00:14:40,632 --> 00:14:44,102
- [Darwin] One summer,
 a few years ago,

144
00:14:44,102 --> 00:14:48,206
I observed this boy playing
 guitar in Central Park.

145
00:14:48,206 --> 00:14:51,443
Shirtless and bare
  foot on the grass,

146
00:14:51,443 --> 00:14:55,113
singing songs of
 doomed hopeless love.

147
00:14:55,113 --> 00:15:00,118
I only saw him for a moment
 but I fell completely in love.

148
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,923
For years his body and
 face fueled fantasies

149
00:15:04,923 --> 00:15:06,858
from which whole
narratives evolved about

150
00:15:06,858 --> 00:15:11,797
the life we would share,
 and the love we would make.

151
00:15:21,573 --> 00:15:23,508
I imagined it was a
 Seth character when

152
00:15:23,508 --> 00:15:25,744
I wrote the script to
 "American Personae"

153
00:15:25,744 --> 00:15:28,347
the movie I'll never get
the opportunity to make.

154
00:15:29,748 --> 00:15:34,252
Can I tell you about him?
  I'd like to tell you.

155
00:15:34,252 --> 00:15:36,755
Not about the story which
  is substantively about

156
00:15:36,755 --> 00:15:39,191
the production of a
 graduate student stage play,

157
00:15:39,191 --> 00:15:43,562
instead, I want to talk to
 you about what I'm most proud.

158
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:50,002
The characters. The first,
  as I said, was named Seth.

159
00:15:51,436 --> 00:15:53,305
And like me, at that age,
  he be a thin Jewish kid

160
00:15:53,305 --> 00:15:56,675
with artistic aspirations, as
 well as a self-hating closet

161
00:15:56,675 --> 00:15:59,778
case who chases after women
 far too beautiful for him.

162
00:16:01,613 --> 00:16:03,882
But it was after the first
  draft began to circulate

163
00:16:03,882 --> 00:16:06,051
and I started
 getting feedback that

164
00:16:06,051 --> 00:16:08,720
I realized how
  badly Seth's story

165
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,956
needed to fit into modern times.

166
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:14,159
And my way of thinking
 about being gay

167
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:15,994
and coming out was
  terribly dated.

168
00:16:16,928 --> 00:16:18,497
As I was talking
to this pen rod,

169
00:16:18,497 --> 00:16:21,333
our culture had
 changed so much that

170
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:23,568
it became difficult
 for me to imagine

171
00:16:23,568 --> 00:16:26,304
the character in the world
  of the white middle class.

172
00:16:31,209 --> 00:16:35,147
At the tender age of
43, I felt like a relic.

173
00:16:36,648 --> 00:16:40,986
A museum piece from a bygone
era of act up and queer nation.

174
00:16:42,721 --> 00:16:45,857
There was a time when, uh,
  gay men's social calendar

175
00:16:45,857 --> 00:16:48,927
was replete with
funerals, of all things.

176
00:16:51,997 --> 00:16:54,232
My how times have changed.

177
00:16:56,301 --> 00:16:58,770
Clearly, I needed
  a new paradigm.

178
00:17:00,238 --> 00:17:02,207
In African American
 men, I found the

179
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:06,011
perfect models geared
  for this precise purpose.

180
00:17:06,011 --> 00:17:08,213
The characters would
 still be fragments,

181
00:17:08,213 --> 00:17:10,115
splinters of the
young man I once

182
00:17:10,115 --> 00:17:12,951
was but refitted culturally.

183
00:17:14,252 --> 00:17:16,288
And while "American Personae"
 would still be about

184
00:17:16,288 --> 00:17:18,256
several generations of
  gay men and the different

185
00:17:18,256 --> 00:17:20,959
worlds they inhabit, it
  will now also be a tale of

186
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,863
young men for whom
  Stonewall never happened.

187
00:17:24,863 --> 00:17:26,898
This life on the down low is a

188
00:17:26,898 --> 00:17:29,167
culture war waged from within.

189
00:17:32,237 --> 00:17:34,506
- Okay, look. Are
  you gonna be on

190
00:17:34,506 --> 00:17:36,575
my ass all night again tonight?

191
00:17:36,575 --> 00:17:38,110
I'm really tired
 and I'd rather be on

192
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:40,178
your ass, if you
  know what I mean.

193
00:17:40,178 --> 00:17:41,980
- I'm sorry. Forget it.

194
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:46,118
- Okay. What is this for?
  - A class.

195
00:17:46,118 --> 00:17:50,489
- I can see that. It's a text
 book. What kind of class?

196
00:17:50,489 --> 00:17:53,258
- Literary and cultural studies.

197
00:17:53,258 --> 00:17:55,260
- That's too bad.

198
00:17:58,263 --> 00:17:59,464
Why'd you stop?

199
00:17:59,464 --> 00:18:01,266
- You're not taking
 this seriously.

200
00:18:01,266 --> 00:18:03,368
- I'm sorry, Celia, but
  you know I'd never be cast

201
00:18:03,368 --> 00:18:05,670
for this sort of bad boy
part in a million years.

202
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:07,739
- Why not?
  - Celia!

203
00:18:07,739 --> 00:18:09,441
The branding character
 belongs to one

204
00:18:09,441 --> 00:18:11,910
of those wildlife
shorts on Animal Planet.

205
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:13,345
- That is so elitist.

206
00:18:13,345 --> 00:18:15,480
- It's not elitist, it's
just this type of guy is

207
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,950
so outside my experience I
 mean, I'm not from this world.

208
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:21,620
- Oh what, there are no
mechanics and plumbers

209
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:25,123
in daddy's little world
  of doctors and engineers?

210
00:18:25,123 --> 00:18:27,159
- Well I'm sure
 that there were but

211
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:29,928
I don't know how they talk to
 their wives or girlfriends.

212
00:18:29,928 --> 00:18:32,130
And what I don't get
is how all these girls,

213
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:35,033
you know even, even the smart
 ones go for guys like him.

214
00:18:35,033 --> 00:18:37,202
- Well, bad boys are strong and

215
00:18:37,202 --> 00:18:39,971
assertive, and women like that.

216
00:18:39,971 --> 00:18:41,640
- Even when strong and assertive

217
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,642
means they treat
women like shit?

218
00:18:43,642 --> 00:18:45,443
- I didn't say
 they weren't jerks.

219
00:18:45,443 --> 00:18:49,548
(phone ringing)

220
00:18:49,548 --> 00:18:52,150
- Oh God.
  - What?

221
00:18:53,185 --> 00:18:55,754
Oh, speaking of your world.

222
00:18:55,754 --> 00:18:57,489
- She stresses me out.

223
00:18:57,489 --> 00:18:58,957
- You know if you
  don't answer it

224
00:18:58,957 --> 00:19:00,892
she's just going
 to keep on calling.

225
00:19:04,796 --> 00:19:09,801
- Hi mom. Yes. I'm on my
  way home from the library.

226
00:19:12,637 --> 00:19:14,372
Wait, why are you so worried?

227
00:19:15,574 --> 00:19:19,177
You called for Deek?
 Why would you do that?

228
00:19:19,177 --> 00:19:22,681
Yeah well he's at the
 apartment and I'm not.

229
00:19:22,681 --> 00:19:25,250
I'm on my way there now, okay?

230
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,552
What, I'm fine!

231
00:19:27,552 --> 00:19:30,889
Okay, I'm getting into the
 subway, I'm going to lose you.

232
00:19:30,889 --> 00:19:34,426
I'll call you tomorrow.
I love you too. Bye.

233
00:19:37,128 --> 00:19:38,897
She's too much.

234
00:19:39,798 --> 00:19:41,132
- I wonder what Brandon the bad

235
00:19:41,132 --> 00:19:42,968
boy would have to
  say about that?

236
00:19:44,202 --> 00:19:46,037
- He'd probably
  say I'm a bookish

237
00:19:46,037 --> 00:19:48,340
little nerd who's terrorized
 by his own mother.

238
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,141
- Oh, come on!

239
00:19:50,141 --> 00:19:51,776
- I'd laugh too
  if it weren't me.

240
00:19:51,776 --> 00:19:55,580
- Aw, poor Isaiah. Don't worry.

241
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:58,817
I think bookish
 little nerds are hot!

242
00:20:02,287 --> 00:20:07,292
- [Celia] Oh, mmm! Okay!
A little softer, yeah!

243
00:20:10,061 --> 00:20:14,899
Hmm, mm hmm! Yeah, like that.

244
00:20:14,899 --> 00:20:19,904
That's really nice. Mm!
Don't stop, don't stop.

245
00:20:26,111 --> 00:20:30,282
Mm, yeah! Slower,
  slower, mm hmm.

246
00:20:32,484 --> 00:20:36,588
Don't stop, don't
  stop, don't stop.

247
00:20:36,588 --> 00:20:38,590
Okay, now a little
  faster, just a little bit.

248
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:40,058
- Okay.

249
00:20:42,227 --> 00:20:44,195
- Oh, don't cum okay? Don't cum.

250
00:20:46,298 --> 00:20:48,566
Just like that.

251
00:20:50,135 --> 00:20:53,071
(pages turning)

252
00:20:53,071 --> 00:20:55,206
- [Darwin] These are
 some characters notes

253
00:20:55,206 --> 00:20:57,442
I made while I was
 revising the script.

254
00:20:58,877 --> 00:21:01,579
The portrayal of Celia should
 be approached cautiously.

255
00:21:01,579 --> 00:21:03,248
It would be too easy
 to play the part

256
00:21:03,248 --> 00:21:05,517
as a one-dimensional
 manipulative harpy.

257
00:21:05,517 --> 00:21:08,320
This is a young lady who has
had a lot of bad luck with men.

258
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,655
In Isaiah, she sees
 a lot of potential,

259
00:21:10,655 --> 00:21:13,124
possibilities that he
 could not see himself.

260
00:21:13,124 --> 00:21:17,529
She merely wants to bring out
 the best in him. And so on.

261
00:21:19,364 --> 00:21:22,934
The conflict here is not that
 Isaiah's attracted to men,

262
00:21:22,934 --> 00:21:27,105
a dirty little secret that he
 can't admit to himself, no.

263
00:21:28,573 --> 00:21:33,411
The problem is his desire for
 an ordinary middle class life.

264
00:21:34,546 --> 00:21:36,648
Where Celia wants, more
than anything else,

265
00:21:36,648 --> 00:21:40,318
a bohemian existence with
  creative fulfillment.

266
00:21:44,789 --> 00:21:46,291
- [Celia] Here's one for you.

267
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:49,594
Eric. Lead role.
 Male. Early twenties.

268
00:21:49,594 --> 00:21:52,497
Self-righteous, sharp
 witted, intellectual.

269
00:21:52,497 --> 00:21:54,466
Skinny hipster music geek with

270
00:21:54,466 --> 00:21:57,802
a dark side. Oh,
  I like it already!

271
00:21:57,802 --> 00:21:59,637
This role requires a
 broad emotional range,

272
00:21:59,637 --> 00:22:01,973
character's deeply insecure and

273
00:22:01,973 --> 00:22:04,275
prone to turns of
 extreme aggression.

274
00:22:04,275 --> 00:22:06,411
Student film, three
 to four day shoot

275
00:22:06,411 --> 00:22:08,580
plus two days of
 intensive rehearsal.

276
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:11,249
Must be New York City based.

277
00:22:11,249 --> 00:22:13,752
- I'm so done with
  student films.

278
00:22:13,752 --> 00:22:16,087
- They could be a great
networking opportunity.

279
00:22:16,087 --> 00:22:18,323
- They're not worth
 the humiliation,

280
00:22:18,323 --> 00:22:21,359
or the cost of the head shot.

281
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:24,295
Besides, I'm going to be
too busy this semester.

282
00:22:25,296 --> 00:22:27,699
- You drive me nuts.
 - What?

283
00:22:27,699 --> 00:22:31,069
- You get every role
 you audition for,

284
00:22:31,069 --> 00:22:33,705
but you don't take it seriously.

285
00:22:33,705 --> 00:22:35,407
- I take it seriously
 enough to know

286
00:22:35,407 --> 00:22:37,375
when I can give it
  a hundred percent.

287
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:39,511
And right now, I
  don't think I can.

288
00:22:40,378 --> 00:22:42,447
- Let me ask you a question.

289
00:22:42,447 --> 00:22:44,916
Where do you see
 yourself in ten years?

290
00:22:44,916 --> 00:22:48,219
- Celia, you're starting
  to sound like my parents.

291
00:22:48,219 --> 00:22:52,457
- It's a simple question,
  where do you see yourself?

292
00:22:52,457 --> 00:22:56,728
- Realistically,
I guess teaching

293
00:22:56,728 --> 00:22:59,631
English in some high school.

294
00:22:59,631 --> 00:23:01,633
- And acting?

295
00:23:01,633 --> 00:23:03,568
- I suppose I'll be
  involved with the theater

296
00:23:03,568 --> 00:23:05,437
department, maybe
  community theater.

297
00:23:05,437 --> 00:23:07,872
- You're not even gonna try
 to make acting a career?

298
00:23:07,872 --> 00:23:10,475
- Celia, the odds
 of making it or even

299
00:23:10,475 --> 00:23:13,144
just making a living as
  an actor are pretty slim.

300
00:23:13,144 --> 00:23:14,679
- That's so defeatist.

301
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:16,648
- It's not defeatist,
 it's a fact.

302
00:23:16,648 --> 00:23:18,316
They want runway
 models with big pecs,

303
00:23:18,316 --> 00:23:21,219
I mean, look at me. I'm
 not exactly Ashton Kutcher.

304
00:23:21,219 --> 00:23:24,222
- You're not even gonna try,
 Isaiah, that's my point!

305
00:23:24,222 --> 00:23:26,991
- Are you getting angry with me?

306
00:23:26,991 --> 00:23:30,395
- No, I'm just frustrated.

307
00:23:30,395 --> 00:23:32,530
- I can see that, why?

308
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:36,301
- Because you have more
  talent than anyone I know.

309
00:23:36,301 --> 00:23:38,503
It's so easy for
  you and you don't

310
00:23:38,503 --> 00:23:41,539
take it seriously.
  You don't care.

311
00:23:42,607 --> 00:23:44,375
- Come on, Celia.

312
00:23:46,111 --> 00:23:48,713
- It just pisses me off.

313
00:23:48,713 --> 00:23:53,218
- Don't be like that. I hate
 it when you get angry with me.

314
00:23:57,589 --> 00:24:02,360
- I'm sorry. Three months
  in, I'm already nagging.

315
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:05,763
- Oh, you want me to go on
  a few auditions don't you?

316
00:24:05,763 --> 00:24:09,167
- I want you to
 have more ambition.

317
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:16,808
- Uh, two auditions!
  I'll go on two auditions.

318
00:24:16,808 --> 00:24:19,277
- Three! And I get
  to choose them.

319
00:24:19,277 --> 00:24:21,446
- [Isaiah] Don't stop!

320
00:24:28,019 --> 00:24:32,790
- So, the question
  remains how can theater be

321
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:36,861
both entertaining
  and instructive?

322
00:24:36,861 --> 00:24:40,198
How can it be divorced
from a place of illusion

323
00:24:40,198 --> 00:24:44,903
and transformed into a
 place of active experience?

324
00:24:44,903 --> 00:24:49,908
Non-melodramatic theater
is one kind of theater

325
00:24:50,975 --> 00:24:54,646
that has very
 specific social goals.

326
00:24:55,613 --> 00:24:57,715
It forces the spectator into a

327
00:24:57,715 --> 00:25:00,451
place of inquiry and criticism,

328
00:25:00,451 --> 00:25:03,621
by perching the
 theater of anything

329
00:25:03,621 --> 00:25:06,224
magical and completely
 stripping it

330
00:25:06,224 --> 00:25:10,194
of its so called
  hypnotic tensions.

331
00:25:12,297 --> 00:25:15,400
The actor no longer pretends
 that there's a fourth wall

332
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,669
and the audience
  is no longer swept

333
00:25:17,669 --> 00:25:21,272
away by what he sees on stage.

334
00:25:24,442 --> 00:25:26,444
I can already see a lot of you

335
00:25:26,444 --> 00:25:28,146
looking at each
  other rolling your

336
00:25:28,146 --> 00:25:30,348
eyes saying who
  is this nut case.

337
00:25:30,348 --> 00:25:33,885
Well, I'm your director,

338
00:25:36,454 --> 00:25:39,357
and the first thing I
 want to say to you as

339
00:25:39,357 --> 00:25:43,695
your director is you will
 all need to want to be here.

340
00:25:46,831 --> 00:25:50,068
This is going to be a
 very challenging and

341
00:25:50,068 --> 00:25:52,870
growing experience
  for all of us, but

342
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:55,640
you're gonna have to trust me.

343
00:25:57,542 --> 00:26:01,312
Rasheeq has written
 an epic play here,

344
00:26:01,312 --> 00:26:04,482
and we're going to
 perform it accordingly

345
00:26:04,482 --> 00:26:07,485
to some very basic
 Burkting principles.

346
00:26:09,988 --> 00:26:13,658
(leaves wrestling)

347
00:26:14,692 --> 00:26:16,961
(lighter striking)

348
00:26:20,598 --> 00:26:22,500
- Celia.

349
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,268
- You missed her.

350
00:26:24,268 --> 00:26:28,239
- Damn. You scared the shit
 out of me. Who'd I miss?

351
00:26:28,239 --> 00:26:32,577
- Celia and Rasheeq. I told
 them I ran out of weed,

352
00:26:32,577 --> 00:26:37,081
so they left. I'm sure
 they'll be back soon.

353
00:26:37,081 --> 00:26:40,318
Do you partake?
- Sure.

354
00:26:43,054 --> 00:26:45,757
- [Isaiah] Don't you correction
guys have to take drug tests?

355
00:26:45,757 --> 00:26:48,893
- Medical staff works for
  a separate contractor.

356
00:26:48,893 --> 00:26:50,495
Plus my one year
probation's over

357
00:26:50,495 --> 00:26:53,197
so I have a window
  for indulgence.

358
00:26:57,435 --> 00:26:59,570
So you misplaced
your girlfriend?

359
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:01,973
- Guess so.

360
00:27:01,973 --> 00:27:03,641
I saw the way she
 and Rasheeq were all

361
00:27:03,641 --> 00:27:05,510
over each other and vice versa.

362
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:07,945
- They were a little blatant.

363
00:27:07,945 --> 00:27:09,447
- So you were expecting
to come in here

364
00:27:09,447 --> 00:27:11,416
and find them having
 a little rendezvous?

365
00:27:13,351 --> 00:27:15,086
- Maybe.

366
00:27:16,154 --> 00:27:17,655
(laughs)

367
00:27:17,655 --> 00:27:20,992
- You theater people are
  a humpy bunch aren't you?

368
00:27:20,992 --> 00:27:22,727
I was just wondering
 if the idea of Rasheeq

369
00:27:22,727 --> 00:27:25,463
and Celia upset you
 or turned you on.

370
00:27:26,764 --> 00:27:28,332
- What do you mean?

371
00:27:28,332 --> 00:27:30,702
- Rasheeq's a good looking guy!

372
00:27:30,702 --> 00:27:34,272
- Yeah. Well he may be good
looking but I don't go that way.

373
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:39,277
- In the army, it's pretty
 tricky. Sometimes dangerous.

374
00:27:40,478 --> 00:27:41,646
You have to have a
  fully operational

375
00:27:41,646 --> 00:27:43,514
gay-dar like really,
 really sharp.

376
00:27:44,749 --> 00:27:46,584
- Is that so?

377
00:27:46,584 --> 00:27:48,786
- Yup. Most in the time
other black dudes are

378
00:27:48,786 --> 00:27:51,155
hard for me to read so I
get the false positives.

379
00:27:51,155 --> 00:27:52,790
Except for you Isaiah.

380
00:27:53,958 --> 00:27:57,962
- You're way off. Really.

381
00:27:57,962 --> 00:27:59,764
- I can see you
getting off on the idea

382
00:27:59,764 --> 00:28:01,899
of Rasheeq sticking it in her.

383
00:28:03,034 --> 00:28:05,636
And you wondering
 what it would be like.

384
00:28:07,872 --> 00:28:10,341
- Why are you saying this?

385
00:28:10,341 --> 00:28:13,244
- I have fantasies too.
- Obviously.

386
00:28:14,579 --> 00:28:16,914
- I started making the costumes
for the show, you know.

387
00:28:16,914 --> 00:28:18,516
- Edward mentioned it.

388
00:28:18,516 --> 00:28:20,118
- Been thinking a lot about your

389
00:28:20,118 --> 00:28:22,320
final fitting, you want
to know how it goes?

390
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,554
- Not particularly.

391
00:28:23,554 --> 00:28:25,256
- You're trying on
 the pants, and while

392
00:28:25,256 --> 00:28:26,924
I'm making a few
  alterations my hand gently

393
00:28:26,924 --> 00:28:29,460
glides over your
  ass, your crotch.

394
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:33,064
You told me to stop but
  your dick's already stiff.

395
00:28:33,064 --> 00:28:36,834
A few minutes later and
I'm going down on you.

396
00:28:36,834 --> 00:28:39,403
I bet you're hard just
 thinking about it.

397
00:28:43,107 --> 00:28:47,311
(water running)

398
00:29:28,186 --> 00:29:30,621
- I'm not my image.

399
00:29:34,792 --> 00:29:36,961
- [Voiceover] Hello!

400
00:29:42,099 --> 00:29:44,502
Is anybody home?

401
00:29:47,538 --> 00:29:52,376
- Hello Stephen, if that
  is in fact your real name.

402
00:29:52,376 --> 00:29:55,213
- You're recycling lines
from your old scripts.

403
00:29:55,213 --> 00:29:58,115
Venturing into Dennis
 Potter territory, isn't it?

404
00:29:58,115 --> 00:30:01,452
- Oh, in more ways that
 you could possibly imagine.

405
00:30:01,452 --> 00:30:05,356
- Video camera batteries.
  - Ah, thank you!

406
00:30:05,356 --> 00:30:08,659
So does this, uh, bring
you back a few years?

407
00:30:08,659 --> 00:30:10,995
- "The Disquiet"
  rehearsals? Yeah.

408
00:30:10,995 --> 00:30:13,831
It seems like it
 was just yesterday.

409
00:30:13,831 --> 00:30:16,934
Hey, where's your
 cast? Shouldn't you
 guys be rehearsing?

410
00:30:16,934 --> 00:30:19,503
They are most
 likely still in bed.

411
00:30:19,503 --> 00:30:21,672
I postponed it till one o'clock,

412
00:30:21,672 --> 00:30:24,442
most of them are either
tend bar or wait tables.

413
00:30:24,442 --> 00:30:25,877
- Of course.

414
00:30:25,877 --> 00:30:27,845
- Figured I'd let them
 sleep in on their first day.

415
00:30:27,845 --> 00:30:29,413
- Well, that's nice of you.

416
00:30:29,413 --> 00:30:31,649
- Keeps me from having
 to pay for lunch.

417
00:30:31,649 --> 00:30:34,185
- That's not so
  nice but at least

418
00:30:34,185 --> 00:30:36,787
I don't have to pretend anymore.

419
00:30:40,358 --> 00:30:41,959
- [Darwin] What?

420
00:30:41,959 --> 00:30:45,029
- Come, Nico told me you
lost funding a week ago.

421
00:30:47,064 --> 00:30:48,232
- Yes.

422
00:30:48,232 --> 00:30:50,401
- So you found
 alternative funding?

423
00:30:51,302 --> 00:30:52,770
- No.

424
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:55,106
- You're funding it yourself?

425
00:30:55,106 --> 00:30:57,508
- Like I ever had any money.

426
00:30:57,508 --> 00:31:00,544
- Okay, so what
  am I missing here?

427
00:31:07,351 --> 00:31:11,923
- Look, the project is
finished, Stephen. Okay?

428
00:31:11,923 --> 00:31:16,227
Kaput. It's just dead
 as a coffin nail.

429
00:31:16,227 --> 00:31:18,462
- But you're going
through with it anyway?

430
00:31:18,462 --> 00:31:21,399
- The theater rental's paid
 and the fee's nonrefundable.

431
00:31:22,633 --> 00:31:24,602
- Have you told your cast?

432
00:31:24,602 --> 00:31:26,437
- No.
  - Christ, Darwin!

433
00:31:26,437 --> 00:31:30,141
- No lectures okay, please!
 - Ugh!

434
00:31:30,141 --> 00:31:31,575
Look, jerking yourself off is

435
00:31:31,575 --> 00:31:34,345
one thing, this is just rotten.

436
00:31:34,345 --> 00:31:36,647
- It is just a few days
out of their lives.

437
00:31:36,647 --> 00:31:39,650
- These people are counting
 on you and your non-film.

438
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:42,453
They're counting on a product,
 a premiere, a wrap party.

439
00:31:42,453 --> 00:31:44,922
You know all that shit!
- You're right!

440
00:31:44,922 --> 00:31:49,226
You're absolutely right. My
 actions are indefensible.

441
00:31:49,226 --> 00:31:52,897
What do you want me to say?
 Life's a bitch ain't it?

442
00:31:52,897 --> 00:31:54,565
- Why are you doing this?

443
00:31:54,565 --> 00:31:56,667
- Need.
 - What need?

444
00:32:00,538 --> 00:32:03,341
- I don't know. I don't know.

445
00:32:04,475 --> 00:32:07,678
I guess it's because
 I want to know

446
00:32:07,678 --> 00:32:11,949
that the story has taken
place as a real event.

447
00:32:11,949 --> 00:32:14,452
To know that these
 characters existed.

448
00:32:14,452 --> 00:32:16,754
- You have dozens of
 unpublished scripts.

449
00:32:16,754 --> 00:32:18,656
Many better than this one.

450
00:32:18,656 --> 00:32:22,293
- Yeah, well this
  one is the truth.

451
00:32:22,293 --> 00:32:24,428
- You are so arrogant.

452
00:32:24,428 --> 00:32:26,230
- Well it's the
  truth as I see it.

453
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:28,566
- The truth is you
  see it as ugly.

454
00:32:28,566 --> 00:32:30,434
Why can't you write
 about the positive

455
00:32:30,434 --> 00:32:32,103
things in the gay community?

456
00:32:32,103 --> 00:32:36,941
- Oh I see! The community
  demands positive images!

457
00:32:36,941 --> 00:32:39,276
I guess the community
 and certain actors

458
00:32:39,276 --> 00:32:41,712
don't want to look
  in the mirror.

459
00:32:41,712 --> 00:32:45,416
- I turned down that
  part because it was ugly.

460
00:32:45,416 --> 00:32:47,585
Edward was mean, he was twisted.

461
00:32:47,585 --> 00:32:49,086
- Not he's not.

462
00:32:49,086 --> 00:32:51,255
- Seriously, is
 that how you see me?

463
00:32:51,255 --> 00:32:55,459
- Half the lines I wrote for
him are direct quotes from you.

464
00:32:55,459 --> 00:32:57,328
Alright, will you
 just wait a second.

465
00:32:57,328 --> 00:32:58,429
Here we go.

466
00:32:58,429 --> 00:33:00,498
- Darwin.
 - Here we go!

467
00:33:00,498 --> 00:33:02,366
Listen to this.

468
00:33:03,834 --> 00:33:07,038
"I've already had love
 and it's long gone.

469
00:33:07,038 --> 00:33:09,940
Now I just tie up
  boys in my bed."

470
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,342
Does that sound familiar?

471
00:33:11,342 --> 00:33:12,543
- We're through.

472
00:33:12,543 --> 00:33:14,945
- What, is the mirror
 too harsh for you?

473
00:33:14,945 --> 00:33:17,815
- You're such a fucking asshole.

474
00:33:17,815 --> 00:33:19,250
- What, do you deny you said it

475
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:21,852
or are you ashamed?
 Are you embarrassed?

476
00:33:21,852 --> 00:33:26,657
- Look, just return the
  batteries when you're done

477
00:33:26,657 --> 00:33:28,959
jerking yourself and
 everybody else off!

478
00:33:30,394 --> 00:33:33,864
- Better hurry up or you'll
 be late for your GLAD meeting.

479
00:33:33,864 --> 00:33:38,035
- It's bad faith, Darwin.
 It's bad faith and it's wrong.

480
00:33:40,171 --> 00:33:43,874
- I love you, Stephen!
 - Go fuck yourself!

481
00:33:43,874 --> 00:33:46,243
(laughs)

482
00:34:00,558 --> 00:34:03,227
- [Darwin Voiceover] Even
 before he left the theater,

483
00:34:03,227 --> 00:34:07,231
I regretted goating my friend
 into a pointless argument.

484
00:34:07,231 --> 00:34:11,335
Since the doctors discovered
 the cancer in my pancreas I,

485
00:34:11,335 --> 00:34:14,438
I become aware of certain
  shifts in my personality.

486
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,342
I feel less like
 myself and more like a

487
00:34:18,342 --> 00:34:21,512
bad copy of the man I once was.

488
00:34:21,512 --> 00:34:24,682
All distorted and
 blurred at the edges.

489
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:28,819
The character of Rasheeq
was to be a reflection

490
00:34:28,819 --> 00:34:31,589
of my mid-twenties
  when as a graduate

491
00:34:31,589 --> 00:34:34,825
student I fancied
 myself as a writer,

492
00:34:34,825 --> 00:34:37,027
having dropped
 acting in a strange

493
00:34:37,027 --> 00:34:39,463
fit of internalized homophobia.

494
00:34:40,631 --> 00:34:42,766
Wearing makeup is
  undignified and

495
00:34:42,766 --> 00:34:45,069
hardly masculine after all.

496
00:34:48,038 --> 00:34:50,741
But I didn't just want to write,

497
00:34:51,809 --> 00:34:54,845
I craved relevance most of all.

498
00:34:55,913 --> 00:34:58,249
I also began to understand the

499
00:34:58,249 --> 00:35:01,318
power my youth had over others.

500
00:35:01,318 --> 00:35:03,988
Specifically, older gay men.

501
00:35:05,222 --> 00:35:06,624
- [Voiceover] He
 was my lover, Jorge,

502
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:08,893
we were together for five years.

503
00:35:08,893 --> 00:35:10,761
- But most of us knew
 him for nearly twenty.

504
00:35:10,761 --> 00:35:13,297
- I'm not in
 competition with you.

505
00:35:13,297 --> 00:35:16,467
- I know you're not,
 I'm sure the last

506
00:35:16,467 --> 00:35:19,570
couple years have
  been rough on you.

507
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:21,772
But it's been rough
 on a lot of people.

508
00:35:21,772 --> 00:35:24,408
Getting old is a bitch!

509
00:35:25,609 --> 00:35:28,445
Getting old in the
 age of AIDs? Oh, shit.

510
00:35:28,445 --> 00:35:31,081
- Lonely, but it's better
  than the alternative.

511
00:35:31,081 --> 00:35:32,883
- True.

512
00:35:34,251 --> 00:35:36,820
You know one of the
  reasons I never called you

513
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:39,490
I wanted to give it enough
 time after Carlito's death,

514
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:42,259
just to make sure of how I felt.

515
00:35:42,259 --> 00:35:44,395
- [Kenneth] I don't want
to hear this, Jorge.

516
00:35:44,395 --> 00:35:47,598
- [Jorge] I've always had
  feelings for you, Kenneth.

517
00:35:47,598 --> 00:35:49,400
- [Kenneth] Jesus,
 you have been watching

518
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,169
too many of those
  sappy telenovelas.

519
00:35:52,169 --> 00:35:53,370
- [Jorge] Kenneth!

520
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:54,605
- [Kenneth] I
 can't believe lines

521
00:35:54,605 --> 00:35:55,906
like that still
  work in Manhattan.

522
00:35:55,906 --> 00:35:57,308
Or do you just see
  all those first

523
00:35:57,308 --> 00:35:58,709
Long Island guys in the sticks?

524
00:35:58,709 --> 00:36:00,010
- [Jorge] Please!
 Keep your voice down.

525
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:00,945
- [Kenneth] My voice is down, is

526
00:36:00,945 --> 00:36:03,714
that why you invited me here?

527
00:36:03,714 --> 00:36:05,549
- I just wanted to spend
some time with you.

528
00:36:05,549 --> 00:36:07,851
- What, a twofer?
 Use your loneliness

529
00:36:07,851 --> 00:36:09,420
and get laid at the same time?

530
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:10,821
- [Jorge] Well get laid, anyway.

531
00:36:10,821 --> 00:36:12,256
- You piece of shit!

532
00:36:12,256 --> 00:36:15,259
- You're aging too, author boy!

533
00:36:15,259 --> 00:36:16,560
If you don't sell
  something big or

534
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,529
hook up with a nice
 rich daddy quick,

535
00:36:18,529 --> 00:36:21,232
well hell fourty's
just around the corner!

536
00:36:21,232 --> 00:36:23,968
Then it's gonna get real tough!

537
00:36:23,968 --> 00:36:25,703
Bagging groceries at the AMPM

538
00:36:25,703 --> 00:36:28,272
might be closer than you think!

539
00:36:28,272 --> 00:36:31,475
- Well done. Well
 done! Any questions?

540
00:36:31,475 --> 00:36:33,510
- I kind of like how
 the scene had the men

541
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:35,779
talking directly to each
  other, touching on nerves.

542
00:36:35,779 --> 00:36:38,282
But the scene
 itself isn't direct.

543
00:36:38,282 --> 00:36:42,386
- Yeah, it was like a
 strange awkward dance.

544
00:36:42,386 --> 00:36:44,221
Even when you think
 the Jorge character is

545
00:36:44,221 --> 00:36:47,091
letting his guard down, it
  turns out to be a gambit.

546
00:36:47,091 --> 00:36:48,559
- So it wasn't soap?

547
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:49,994
- No! Not at all.

548
00:36:49,994 --> 00:36:52,630
- This is the least soapy
thing we've workshopped so far.

549
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:55,532
- Good. Any questions, Arthur?

550
00:36:55,532 --> 00:36:58,235
- Yeah. Um, without having
  read the rest of the play,

551
00:36:58,235 --> 00:36:59,904
were you able to
  get a feel of the

552
00:36:59,904 --> 00:37:01,805
characters just by
  reading the lines?

553
00:37:01,805 --> 00:37:03,741
- Sure.
  - Totally.

554
00:37:03,741 --> 00:37:06,110
- Even as a straight
 guy that's never been

555
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:08,212
in a situation like
  this, I mean I don't know

556
00:37:08,212 --> 00:37:10,347
if it showed but
  I was right there.

557
00:37:10,347 --> 00:37:12,216
Just saying the words put
  me where I needed to be.

558
00:37:12,216 --> 00:37:14,285
- [Arthur] Interesting.
Trust me, it showed.

559
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:16,787
- Anyone else?

560
00:37:18,155 --> 00:37:20,391
- Uh, when was this
supposed to take place?

561
00:37:20,391 --> 00:37:22,393
- Yeah, I was wondering
the same thing myself.

562
00:37:22,393 --> 00:37:25,062
- [Arthur] In the late
 80's, early 90's when

563
00:37:25,062 --> 00:37:28,132
a term "AIDs widow"
 sort of took hold.

564
00:37:28,132 --> 00:37:31,268
- Gentlemen, good
 job. Good job, Arthur.

565
00:37:32,569 --> 00:37:37,141
Okay, up next we have Rasheeq's
one act play "Corpis".

566
00:37:37,141 --> 00:37:40,177
David, you've been game
for everything already.

567
00:37:40,177 --> 00:37:41,245
- This is volunteer, right?

568
00:37:41,245 --> 00:37:42,479
- [Stephen] Yes.

569
00:37:42,479 --> 00:37:43,914
- I don't want to be
 involved in this one.

570
00:37:43,914 --> 00:37:45,683
- [Stephen] May I ask why?

571
00:37:45,683 --> 00:37:47,318
- [David] I'd rather
 not get into it.

572
00:37:47,318 --> 00:37:49,320
- Well, you don't
 owe me an explanation

573
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,056
but I think you do
 owe the author one.

574
00:37:52,056 --> 00:37:53,857
- [David] Look man,
I'm sure you mean well.

575
00:37:53,857 --> 00:37:55,492
But if you want to do a piece on

576
00:37:55,492 --> 00:37:57,461
the prisoners of
 Guantanamo Bay, fine.

577
00:37:57,461 --> 00:37:59,863
If you want to do a piece on
the Holocaust, you know, great.

578
00:37:59,863 --> 00:38:01,265
But don't think
  you can put those

579
00:38:01,265 --> 00:38:02,833
two side by and in comparison.

580
00:38:02,833 --> 00:38:04,168
- Why do you object
 to the Auschwitz

581
00:38:04,168 --> 00:38:05,636
reference and not to Manzanar?

582
00:38:05,636 --> 00:38:06,937
- [David] That's personal.

583
00:38:06,937 --> 00:38:08,806
- So it's your
  history? As a Jew?

584
00:38:08,806 --> 00:38:10,107
- Yeah, so?

585
00:38:10,107 --> 00:38:11,608
- Manzanar is your history as an

586
00:38:11,608 --> 00:38:13,978
American isn't it?
  As a human being?

587
00:38:13,978 --> 00:38:16,447
- Look, like I said, I
  don't want to get into it.

588
00:38:16,447 --> 00:38:18,048
- But you want to take
 ownership of certain

589
00:38:18,048 --> 00:38:19,917
histories and not others?
  - Leave it alone, Rasheeq.

590
00:38:19,917 --> 00:38:21,418
- [David] Look, show me
 evidence that the prisoners of

591
00:38:21,418 --> 00:38:22,653
Guantanamo Bay worked to
  death, starved to death...

592
00:38:22,653 --> 00:38:24,121
- Sadism isn't the
  only parameter.

593
00:38:24,121 --> 00:38:26,190
- Show me that, and I'll perform
in your shitty little play!

594
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:27,624
- This is inappropriate
in the class room.

595
00:38:27,624 --> 00:38:29,159
- You know what, Rasheeq, maybe

596
00:38:29,159 --> 00:38:30,494
I don't own the Holocaust
  but I can lay claim to it.

597
00:38:30,494 --> 00:38:32,229
My grandmother
survived Bergen Belsen.

598
00:38:32,229 --> 00:38:34,131
You want to tell her how
GTMO compares to that?

599
00:38:34,131 --> 00:38:36,767
- [Rasheeq] GTMO,
  Manzanar, Genene,

600
00:38:36,767 --> 00:38:38,435
I'm sure your grandmother would

601
00:38:38,435 --> 00:38:39,970
be the first to see it my way.

602
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:42,039
- Great. So now you're an
  expert on my grandmother.

603
00:38:42,039 --> 00:38:43,574
- [Rasheeq] She'd
 seen it all before,

604
00:38:43,574 --> 00:38:46,009
or do you own your
  grandmother's history too?

605
00:38:46,009 --> 00:38:47,544
- You I love how
everybody in your world

606
00:38:47,544 --> 00:38:49,246
denies the Holocaust
 ever happened until

607
00:38:49,246 --> 00:38:50,681
they can use it
  to their own end!

608
00:38:50,681 --> 00:38:51,915
- David, stop right there!

609
00:38:51,915 --> 00:38:53,217
- And you think all
 Holocaust denials

610
00:38:53,217 --> 00:38:54,685
from my world? What is that?

611
00:38:54,685 --> 00:38:55,953
- What about fuck you
 and your quality of

612
00:38:55,953 --> 00:38:57,821
suffering bull shit.
 - [Stephen] Stop it!

613
00:38:57,821 --> 00:39:00,124
- Don't you mean compassion,
 mister arrogant Jew!

614
00:39:00,124 --> 00:39:02,025
- Oh Christ!
  - [Stephen] What was that?

615
00:39:02,025 --> 00:39:03,260
- What the hell
  he'd just call me?

616
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:05,763
- Out now! Out!

617
00:39:05,763 --> 00:39:07,531
- [Sergio] Take it
easy, it's not worth it!

618
00:39:07,531 --> 00:39:09,333
You're such an ass hole!

619
00:39:15,339 --> 00:39:17,941
- [Rasheeq] Nothing to
say? I can't believe you

620
00:39:17,941 --> 00:39:20,577
made me apologize to
him. It was humiliating!

621
00:39:20,577 --> 00:39:22,846
- I can't believe you said it!

622
00:39:22,846 --> 00:39:25,783
"Mister arrogant Jew"!
 What are you thinking?

623
00:39:25,783 --> 00:39:27,418
- He claimed he owned history.

624
00:39:27,418 --> 00:39:29,052
- You claimed he owned history!

625
00:39:29,052 --> 00:39:30,954
Do you have any idea the
position you put me in?

626
00:39:30,954 --> 00:39:33,223
- I never said anything
  even remotely Antisemitic.

627
00:39:33,223 --> 00:39:35,159
- Don't be so naive, this isn't

628
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:37,494
about religion.
 It's about politics.

629
00:39:37,494 --> 00:39:40,964
Why can't you respect
 my position for once?

630
00:39:40,964 --> 00:39:43,000
- You covet yourself
 well enough.

631
00:39:46,303 --> 00:39:49,440
- Look, people can believe
  that they own history.

632
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,142
It's normal, it's healthy.

633
00:39:52,142 --> 00:39:54,411
Have you heard the
  name Pierre Seel?

634
00:39:56,246 --> 00:39:57,548
- No.

635
00:39:57,548 --> 00:40:00,284
- Seel was a man, a
 gay man, captured by

636
00:40:00,284 --> 00:40:03,821
the Nazis and put in a
concentration camp by being gay.

637
00:40:06,924 --> 00:40:09,693
The Nazis took a metal
 bucket Seel's lover's

638
00:40:09,693 --> 00:40:13,664
head, and they set
  the dogs on him.

639
00:40:14,798 --> 00:40:16,967
Tore him to pieces
 before his very eyes.

640
00:40:20,237 --> 00:40:21,972
- [Rasheeq] Your point?

641
00:40:21,972 --> 00:40:26,977
- My point is that's gay
  history. It's my history.

642
00:40:29,179 --> 00:40:32,116
And as bad and rotten
 as Guantanamo Bay is,

643
00:40:32,116 --> 00:40:35,085
it's nothing compared to that.

644
00:40:35,085 --> 00:40:40,090
- The United States of America
 not as bad as Nazi Germany.

645
00:40:41,525 --> 00:40:44,728
Don't you think you're
 setting the bar a little low?

646
00:40:54,104 --> 00:40:55,973
- [Darwin] Edward
  is an amalgam of

647
00:40:55,973 --> 00:40:59,977
several refugees from the 1980's
I've known over the years.

648
00:40:59,977 --> 00:41:04,281
And like most of those man the
 character's capacity to love

649
00:41:04,281 --> 00:41:09,253
had been irreparably damaged
 by loss. A tragic, empty husk.

650
00:41:12,055 --> 00:41:13,557
(record plays piano music)

651
00:41:13,557 --> 00:41:14,892
My poor friend Stephen couldn't

652
00:41:14,892 --> 00:41:16,960
help but see
 himself in the role.

653
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,130
(phone rings)

654
00:41:21,298 --> 00:41:25,702
- Hello! Well, Mr.
 Flood, how are you?

655
00:41:28,739 --> 00:41:32,676
Right. I know your name's Kevin.

656
00:41:32,676 --> 00:41:34,545
(laughs)

657
00:41:36,346 --> 00:41:38,849
Uh huh. Listen,
  I've got a career

658
00:41:38,849 --> 00:41:41,151
opportunity for you in academia.

659
00:41:45,756 --> 00:41:47,424
It would require you to dust off

660
00:41:47,424 --> 00:41:49,393
your skills as a drama curch.

661
00:42:08,645 --> 00:42:13,584
(phone rings)

662
00:42:14,718 --> 00:42:17,054
- Hello?

663
00:42:18,055 --> 00:42:20,724
Mama! Hello!

664
00:43:07,904 --> 00:43:10,040
Okay. Okay.

665
00:43:12,009 --> 00:43:14,911
Okay. Buh bye.

666
00:43:22,386 --> 00:43:24,988
- [Stephen] No
 that'd be fine. Okay.

667
00:43:26,757 --> 00:43:28,959
Okay, so I'll fax
 you the play tonight

668
00:43:28,959 --> 00:43:32,162
and send him over in
 the morning. Okay.

669
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:34,998
Oh, and I've set
up a meeting for

670
00:43:34,998 --> 00:43:37,134
you with the department chair.

671
00:43:39,736 --> 00:43:42,873
No, just be your
 usual charming self.

672
00:43:43,874 --> 00:43:46,043
(laughs)

673
00:43:47,144 --> 00:43:51,048
Yeah. Alright,
 alright. Bye, Kevin.

674
00:43:54,618 --> 00:43:58,055
Ah! Thought you were gonna
  let me die of thirst.

675
00:43:59,523 --> 00:44:01,591
Was that your phone ringing?

676
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:08,298
- It was nothing, just a
little family business.

677
00:44:08,298 --> 00:44:10,767
- Rash, Rash!

678
00:44:10,767 --> 00:44:15,005
- Gin, Edward. I splashed
  a little gin in my eyes.

679
00:44:15,005 --> 00:44:16,473
- Ow.

680
00:44:18,408 --> 00:44:19,976
I set up a meeting for you with

681
00:44:19,976 --> 00:44:21,611
a friend on mine in Manhattan.

682
00:44:21,611 --> 00:44:23,447
He wants to go over your play.

683
00:44:23,447 --> 00:44:24,881
- Another teacher?

684
00:44:24,881 --> 00:44:26,783
- No, this one's like you.

685
00:44:26,783 --> 00:44:29,920
A little thick
 headed for academia.

686
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,589
You will meet with
  him, won't you?

687
00:44:32,589 --> 00:44:35,926
- Yeah sure.
 - Good.

688
00:44:48,872 --> 00:44:51,108
On your belly.

689
00:44:55,011 --> 00:44:59,216
Kevin Flood's the real deal and

690
00:44:59,216 --> 00:45:01,952
the theater fest deadline looms.

691
00:45:01,952 --> 00:45:03,653
- [Rasheeq] I'll go!

692
00:45:03,653 --> 00:45:06,490
- Good, but I have some new toys

693
00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:08,492
I want to use on you tonight.

694
00:45:08,492 --> 00:45:10,360
- Can this be the
 last time for a while?

695
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:12,963
I'd like to be able to go
  to the beach this summer.

696
00:45:12,963 --> 00:45:16,666
- Oh, you should let them
  see the wounds of art.

697
00:45:16,666 --> 00:45:18,735
- Edward.

698
00:45:18,735 --> 00:45:21,404
- Alright, but that
 means tonight is going

699
00:45:21,404 --> 00:45:24,141
to have to be something
extra special.

700
00:45:39,456 --> 00:45:44,461
- Tomorrow's your big day!
  You must be very excited.

701
00:45:45,796 --> 00:45:49,499
- I guess. I'm more
 nervous than anything else.

702
00:45:49,499 --> 00:45:51,701
It's out of my hands now.

703
00:45:54,838 --> 00:45:57,140
What's wrong?

704
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:58,775
- I don't know.

705
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:01,711
On my drive home from
 work I was really

706
00:46:01,711 --> 00:46:05,982
looking forward to our play
 time. Now i'm just bored.

707
00:46:08,218 --> 00:46:10,387
- With me, or with the toys?

708
00:46:11,621 --> 00:46:13,723
- I don't know.

709
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,629
- We could just try having sex.

710
00:46:19,629 --> 00:46:22,599
You know, without
  the accessories.

711
00:46:22,599 --> 00:46:24,301
- Would you like that?

712
00:46:24,301 --> 00:46:27,337
I thought you'd rather be
  doing Isaiah's girlfriend.

713
00:46:29,005 --> 00:46:33,310
- I almost did, but
 then I realized she
 doesn't interest me.

714
00:46:34,511 --> 00:46:36,813
- So what interests
 Rasheeq these days?

715
00:46:36,813 --> 00:46:39,449
- You!
 - Me?

716
00:46:40,684 --> 00:46:44,154
- Pleasing you.
  - Don't say that.

717
00:46:45,322 --> 00:46:47,958
- Why not?

718
00:46:47,958 --> 00:46:52,329
- Because I know where this is
 going and I'll just ruin it.

719
00:46:52,329 --> 00:46:53,797
- I owe you so much.

720
00:46:53,797 --> 00:46:56,433
- You don't owe me anything.

721
00:46:56,433 --> 00:47:01,104
- But, the giving and
 the wanting together,
 isn't that love?

722
00:47:02,539 --> 00:47:04,908
- Fuck!

723
00:47:04,908 --> 00:47:06,810
- Why are you
 reacting like this?

724
00:47:06,810 --> 00:47:09,546
- 'Cause that's not
 part of the deal.

725
00:47:12,048 --> 00:47:14,217
No wonder I've lost interest.

726
00:47:15,151 --> 00:47:17,988
I should have seen this coming.

727
00:47:17,988 --> 00:47:19,923
- I don't understand.

728
00:47:21,291 --> 00:47:25,362
- I help you with your academic
career, and you surrender

729
00:47:25,362 --> 00:47:28,465
your body to me,
that's the arrangement.

730
00:47:28,465 --> 00:47:30,901
- We never had an arrangement.

731
00:47:30,901 --> 00:47:35,438
- And then you leave.
 Find a nice girl.

732
00:47:36,907 --> 00:47:38,808
- And if I don't want that?

733
00:47:38,808 --> 00:47:41,077
- You know damn
 well you want that!

734
00:47:41,077 --> 00:47:43,880
- Even if I want you?

735
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:45,715
- That's the deal breaker.

736
00:47:45,715 --> 00:47:47,350
- Edward.

737
00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:49,886
- You don't need me anymore.

738
00:47:50,954 --> 00:47:52,956
When the production's
 done I suggest

739
00:47:52,956 --> 00:47:55,025
you find somewhere else to live.

740
00:47:55,025 --> 00:47:57,794
- Please. Don't.

741
00:47:57,794 --> 00:48:00,597
- You need to get
  on with your life.

742
00:48:00,597 --> 00:48:03,800
I'll get clean linens
 for the guest room.

743
00:48:20,984 --> 00:48:23,286
- You know, when I was younger

744
00:48:23,286 --> 00:48:26,423
we used to rehearse
 everything barefoot.

745
00:48:26,423 --> 00:48:30,260
Don't bother asking me
 why, I have no idea.

746
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:33,296
But as we soon as
 climbed the thrust,

747
00:48:33,296 --> 00:48:36,032
the shoes and the
  socks came off.

748
00:48:38,101 --> 00:48:40,870
I've come to think of the
  stage floor as kind of a

749
00:48:40,870 --> 00:48:44,975
third rail, connecting all
 of us to it and each other.

750
00:48:46,209 --> 00:48:48,912
The things one imagines.

751
00:48:50,714 --> 00:48:54,484
I spoke earlier of the
crisis of metamorphosis,

752
00:48:54,484 --> 00:48:58,421
but in 1988 and the
 age of 27, I found

753
00:48:58,421 --> 00:49:02,625
myself at a crossroads
 of identity.

754
00:49:05,095 --> 00:49:08,598
It was a time
 filled with longing.

755
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:15,305
A longing to fill a void both
 spiritual and intellectual.

756
00:49:16,539 --> 00:49:18,875
Freshly home from
 serving in Iraq and

757
00:49:18,875 --> 00:49:21,845
nearing his 30th birthday,
  the character of Wesley

758
00:49:21,845 --> 00:49:25,115
was about to find himself
  at a similar crossroads.

759
00:49:32,956 --> 00:49:36,359
- I thought after a
 time I would tire of

760
00:49:36,359 --> 00:49:40,730
painting you but
 you've become perfect.

761
00:49:42,132 --> 00:49:45,969
Perfect age, right
  on the cusp of 30,

762
00:49:47,570 --> 00:49:51,174
a fit man's body
 but with that boyish

763
00:49:51,174 --> 00:49:54,978
mischievous spark
  still in the eye.

764
00:49:58,014 --> 00:49:59,683
I don't think
 anybody could do it

765
00:49:59,683 --> 00:50:02,452
justice in New Orleans,
certainly not in words.

766
00:50:04,854 --> 00:50:07,257
And then it passes so quickly.

767
00:50:09,059 --> 00:50:11,294
I think you know
 what I'm about to say

768
00:50:11,294 --> 00:50:13,663
and trust me, it isn't
 any easier for me

769
00:50:13,663 --> 00:50:15,699
to say than it is
  for you to hear.

770
00:50:17,567 --> 00:50:20,537
There are those of us
  who have what it takes to

771
00:50:20,537 --> 00:50:25,308
be an artist and those that
 don't. It's as simple as that.

772
00:50:27,677 --> 00:50:30,580
And God, I saw so much
potential in your earlier work,

773
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:35,585
so much possibility but
you just don't have it.

774
00:50:40,824 --> 00:50:43,326
I mean whatever it was I saw
 in those earlier paintings

775
00:50:43,326 --> 00:50:46,496
that you brought to me, I mean,

776
00:50:46,496 --> 00:50:49,999
what is it now? Three years ago?

777
00:50:49,999 --> 00:50:54,204
Well whatever it was, I
 don't see it and it's just,

778
00:50:55,638 --> 00:50:58,908
it's just not there. I
  mean, maybe it never was.

779
00:51:02,679 --> 00:51:05,648
But you've known this for a
 while, haven't you Wesley?

780
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:10,854
Of course you have, you're too
 smart, you're too self aware.

781
00:51:14,691 --> 00:51:17,627
Must be horribly
 frustrating for you

782
00:51:19,362 --> 00:51:23,032
but you'll just have to
 settle for a lesser career.

783
00:51:23,032 --> 00:51:28,037
Maybe like a senator or
president of something.

784
00:51:34,377 --> 00:51:36,613
Wesley?

785
00:51:41,584 --> 00:51:43,586
- [Darwin Voiceover] Wesley was

786
00:51:43,586 --> 00:51:46,589
relieved to be told
 he had no talent.

787
00:51:46,589 --> 00:51:48,324
He felt liberated
  from the tyranny

788
00:51:48,324 --> 00:51:51,127
of his artistic potential,
  free to pursue the

789
00:51:51,127 --> 00:51:54,063
stability that be
 desperately craved.

790
00:52:01,938 --> 00:52:03,406
- [Voiceover] So
  you said something

791
00:52:03,406 --> 00:52:06,075
about the probability of
 being stretched to the limit.

792
00:52:06,075 --> 00:52:07,844
- Did I?

793
00:52:07,844 --> 00:52:09,979
- I watched the tape.

794
00:52:09,979 --> 00:52:12,448
- Oh, then I guess I did.

795
00:52:12,448 --> 00:52:15,084
Well if you want me to
  peel that particular onion

796
00:52:15,084 --> 00:52:19,389
then I guess I should start
with the 1980's when any gay man

797
00:52:19,389 --> 00:52:22,458
who was sexually active at
 the beginning of the decade

798
00:52:22,458 --> 00:52:26,496
was astonished that he was
  alive at its conclusion.

799
00:52:26,496 --> 00:52:30,200
Especially if everyone he knew
 or slept with had perished.

800
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:35,071
- So it's just that you find
 odd that you didn't get HIV?

801
00:52:35,071 --> 00:52:38,708
- Odd? Odd and evens.

802
00:52:38,708 --> 00:52:40,276
- What's that?

803
00:52:40,276 --> 00:52:43,079
- Well, if you flip
 a coin twelve times,

804
00:52:43,079 --> 00:52:46,816
half the time it will land on
 heads the other half, tails.

805
00:52:46,816 --> 00:52:51,521
Two choices. Fifty percent
  chance of either outcome.

806
00:52:52,922 --> 00:52:56,793
Now, what if I told you it
 landed on heads twelve times?

807
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:59,195
- That's impossible.

808
00:52:59,195 --> 00:53:02,799
- It's not impossible but
  it's probably improbable.

809
00:53:02,799 --> 00:53:05,868
We call the universe improbable.

810
00:53:05,868 --> 00:53:07,604
- But there are too
 many variables in

811
00:53:07,604 --> 00:53:09,739
something like
 contracting a disease,

812
00:53:09,739 --> 00:53:11,941
you can't compare it
 to flipping a coin.

813
00:53:11,941 --> 00:53:15,645
- Well, of course not.
  But I thought of that too.

814
00:53:16,779 --> 00:53:21,150
So I, one day, many
 years ago, I dug

815
00:53:21,150 --> 00:53:26,155
up my father's Colt
 Python 6, a revolver.

816
00:53:29,726 --> 00:53:33,796
I loaded a single round in the

817
00:53:33,796 --> 00:53:37,667
chamber and I gave
  it a good spin.

818
00:53:37,667 --> 00:53:41,571
Then I put the barrel in my
mouth and I pulled the trigger.

819
00:53:43,806 --> 00:53:47,076
Obviously I didn't
  die, but there was

820
00:53:47,076 --> 00:53:51,848
a one in six chance that
I'd blow my head off.

821
00:53:51,848 --> 00:53:54,350
- Hey! You turned it
 off at the best part.

822
00:53:54,350 --> 00:53:56,719
You should have heard him go
on about the fabric of reality.

823
00:53:56,719 --> 00:53:58,788
- Chances are I've
 heard it all before.

824
00:53:58,788 --> 00:54:00,556
- Oh I thought you'd be curious.

825
00:54:00,556 --> 00:54:01,958
- Nope.

826
00:54:01,958 --> 00:54:04,594
- Well, whatever.
 Unless you told him,

827
00:54:04,594 --> 00:54:06,229
he doesn't even know about us.

828
00:54:06,229 --> 00:54:09,565
- Careful, Rene. He may seem
nutty but he's very perceptive.

829
00:54:09,565 --> 00:54:11,901
Always sniffing for
 blood in the water.

830
00:54:11,901 --> 00:54:14,537
- How dramatic. God,
you're as bad as he is.

831
00:54:14,537 --> 00:54:16,105
- Just do yourself
  a favor and keep

832
00:54:16,105 --> 00:54:18,207
it cool and
 professional with him.

833
00:54:18,207 --> 00:54:21,911
We're having fun and
 he'd just ruin it.

834
00:54:21,911 --> 00:54:23,146
These are new.

835
00:54:23,146 --> 00:54:25,348
- I just printed them
 for my entropy show.

836
00:54:25,348 --> 00:54:28,685
If anybody would do it, I
 can't even interest a gallery.

837
00:54:28,685 --> 00:54:32,422
- They're fantastic,
like pictures of memory.

838
00:54:32,422 --> 00:54:34,657
- Any particular memory?

839
00:54:34,657 --> 00:54:36,492
- An old bus graveyard near the

840
00:54:36,492 --> 00:54:38,161
train station when I was a kid.

841
00:54:38,161 --> 00:54:40,830
Buses from like
  the 40's and 50's.

842
00:54:40,830 --> 00:54:44,100
I wanted more than anything to
 explore them, find treasure.

843
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:48,371
- Sounds like a painting.
  - Don't start.

844
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:52,742
Right now my interests
 lie elsewhere.

845
00:54:52,742 --> 00:54:54,310
- Ah! So this is a booty call.

846
00:54:54,310 --> 00:54:57,547
Ah! I don't think so,
 I'm sweaty and gross.

847
00:54:57,547 --> 00:54:59,248
- Sweaty and gross is sexy!

848
00:54:59,248 --> 00:55:01,351
- My shift in the restaurant
 starts in an hour.

849
00:55:01,351 --> 00:55:03,386
- I'll skip the appetizer and
 go right for the main course.

850
00:55:03,386 --> 00:55:05,521
- No, no, no, no!
  I can't do that.

851
00:55:05,521 --> 00:55:08,424
I gotta go, no. I gotta go!

852
00:55:32,348 --> 00:55:33,583
- [Wesley] Want
  to come out to the

853
00:55:33,583 --> 00:55:34,751
island with me on Saturday?

854
00:55:34,751 --> 00:55:35,952
- [Rene] Fire Island?

855
00:55:35,952 --> 00:55:37,153
- [Wesley] Long Island.

856
00:55:37,153 --> 00:55:38,287
- [Rene] Why?

857
00:55:38,287 --> 00:55:40,089
- [Wesley] Look at houses.

858
00:55:40,089 --> 00:55:42,892
- [Rene] No, I got a
wedding to shoot at two.

859
00:55:42,892 --> 00:55:44,794
- [Wesley] And on Sunday?

860
00:55:44,794 --> 00:55:45,995
- [Rene] A bar mitzvah.

861
00:55:45,995 --> 00:55:47,930
- [Wesley] Oh. I
 didn't realize your

862
00:55:47,930 --> 00:55:49,665
videography business
 was doing so well.

863
00:55:49,665 --> 00:55:51,601
- [Rene] Why do you want
to live on Long Island?

864
00:55:51,601 --> 00:55:54,036
- Why not? It's
 the American dream.

865
00:55:54,036 --> 00:55:56,205
Own a home, invest
  in the future.

866
00:55:56,205 --> 00:56:00,009
- ♪ Domestic bushes
 shelter from failing♪

867
00:56:00,009 --> 00:56:01,511
- That's a bit harsh.

868
00:56:01,511 --> 00:56:04,680
- Tim Rice never lies. The
 suburbs are about giving up.

869
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:06,282
- People get married
 and have bar mitzvahs

870
00:56:06,282 --> 00:56:07,850
out on the Island too, you know.

871
00:56:07,850 --> 00:56:10,486
there's nothing stopping
you from working there.

872
00:56:10,486 --> 00:56:14,557
- Well, I'm not just
interested in paying the bills.

873
00:56:14,557 --> 00:56:17,994
That's not my world and
you're not that man.

874
00:56:17,994 --> 00:56:20,430
- How do you know
 what kind of man I am?

875
00:56:22,365 --> 00:56:24,500
- You're ready to plunge
into this other life

876
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:26,302
just because one miserable
  old has been thinks

877
00:56:26,302 --> 00:56:29,372
that you're not an artist.
  - Okay, I got it.

878
00:56:29,372 --> 00:56:32,275
- Don't become that
 other man Wesley.

879
00:56:32,275 --> 00:56:35,745
I mean, what are you,
 how old are you again?

880
00:56:35,745 --> 00:56:37,447
- I'll be 30 next month.

881
00:56:37,447 --> 00:56:41,951
- 30? Oh fuck! Forget what I
 said, do whatever you like.

882
00:56:41,951 --> 00:56:45,087
Ouch!
 - Smart ass!

883
00:56:45,087 --> 00:56:49,792
- You love my ass.
 Ah! You made me late!

884
00:56:54,730 --> 00:56:56,499
- Fuck.

885
00:56:56,499 --> 00:56:58,201
- [Darwin Voiceover]
  That scene between Wesley

886
00:56:58,201 --> 00:57:00,536
and Rene is the
  crux of the story.

887
00:57:00,536 --> 00:57:03,973
The entire reason for bringing
 these characters together.

888
00:57:05,274 --> 00:57:07,210
Yeah, it's a conversation
  I think gay men

889
00:57:07,210 --> 00:57:10,746
should be having but can't. Why?

890
00:57:10,746 --> 00:57:12,381
Because somewhere along the line

891
00:57:12,381 --> 00:57:13,783
we got it into our heads that we

892
00:57:13,783 --> 00:57:15,952
should want to be
 like the straights.

893
00:57:15,952 --> 00:57:19,455
That we could pretend
 to be like them

894
00:57:19,455 --> 00:57:21,123
You know, just as the
 liberation came out

895
00:57:21,123 --> 00:57:22,959
of the 70's and
 death from the 80's,

896
00:57:22,959 --> 00:57:25,461
the 1990's sewed the
 seeds of assimilation

897
00:57:25,461 --> 00:57:28,097
and conformity that
 have taken root today.

898
00:57:29,298 --> 00:57:31,267
The total hijacking of
 the gay movement came

899
00:57:31,267 --> 00:57:34,003
when we chose emulation
over invention.

900
00:57:38,007 --> 00:57:39,575
- The only thing these
 little gay boys want

901
00:57:39,575 --> 00:57:42,645
today is from that insidious
 institution of marriage.

902
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:45,982
- Imagine that!
- Don't laugh.

903
00:57:45,982 --> 00:57:48,885
It barely works
  for the straights.

904
00:57:48,885 --> 00:57:53,122
God, the horror of our society

905
00:57:53,122 --> 00:57:58,127
is that everybody works
  so hard just to be normal.

906
00:57:58,995 --> 00:58:00,496
- And end up voting Republican.

907
00:58:00,496 --> 00:58:05,334
- Sad, but true. I mean this
 is such a strange generation.

908
00:58:07,069 --> 00:58:09,372
They're either out of the
 closet the day they pop out

909
00:58:09,372 --> 00:58:10,573
of the womb...

910
00:58:10,573 --> 00:58:11,841
- Rene.

911
00:58:11,841 --> 00:58:13,809
- Or, they're
 walking a tight rope.

912
00:58:13,809 --> 00:58:15,511
- Isaiah.

913
00:58:16,646 --> 00:58:18,281
- Lovely, isn't he?

914
00:58:18,281 --> 00:58:20,783
- Mm! He is! Funny
  how everyone else

915
00:58:20,783 --> 00:58:23,052
know he's gay except
him and his girlfriend.

916
00:58:23,052 --> 00:58:24,654
- Well I don't know about that

917
00:58:24,654 --> 00:58:28,724
last part but he is adorable.

918
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:33,963
- Stay away from him, Kevin.

919
00:58:33,963 --> 00:58:36,699
Seriously, you have
  nothing to offer that kid.

920
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:39,769
- Go fuck yourself.

921
00:58:39,769 --> 00:58:41,604
- Don't delude yourself
into thinking that you

922
00:58:41,604 --> 00:58:44,941
can save Isaiah, he isn't
 going to reenlist like Wesley.

923
00:58:44,941 --> 00:58:46,475
And come to think of it, I think

924
00:58:46,475 --> 00:58:50,513
what you did with
 him was really cruel.

925
00:58:50,513 --> 00:58:54,083
- Well if he had gone back
 to Iraq he might be dead now.

926
00:58:54,083 --> 00:58:56,819
- You really think you can
 save these kids, don't you?

927
00:58:56,819 --> 00:58:58,321
Did it ever occur
  to you that Wesley

928
00:58:58,321 --> 00:59:01,490
knew who he was in the Army?

929
00:59:01,490 --> 00:59:04,493
- No character's more fluid
 than that and you know it.

930
00:59:04,493 --> 00:59:06,762
- He wasn't a good
  painter, Kevin.

931
00:59:06,762 --> 00:59:08,631
Seriously, you made
 him think he was

932
00:59:08,631 --> 00:59:12,401
something that he wasn't,
  and then burst his dreams.

933
00:59:12,401 --> 00:59:14,437
And now that he's trying
  to build his life back up

934
00:59:14,437 --> 00:59:17,173
again what do you do?
 Belittle his choices.

935
00:59:18,541 --> 00:59:20,743
- Oh, he just wants to
live with his boyfriend

936
00:59:20,743 --> 00:59:23,346
in some gingerbread
 house in the burbs.

937
00:59:23,346 --> 00:59:26,582
I'd hoped he'd be
  stronger, you know invent.

938
00:59:26,582 --> 00:59:28,317
- See that's what
  I'm talking about.

939
00:59:28,317 --> 00:59:30,219
That liberation shit doesn't
 exist in their world.

940
00:59:30,219 --> 00:59:32,254
They grew up on "Will &
Grace" for God's sake.

941
00:59:32,254 --> 00:59:34,724
That's a big shift.

942
00:59:34,724 --> 00:59:38,060
- None of it's real. I mean
 a life cannot be purchased.

943
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:42,865
- Yes, it can! A life
 today is a life style.

944
00:59:42,865 --> 00:59:45,935
Citizenship is out,
 consumerism is in.

945
00:59:45,935 --> 00:59:49,472
Or have you been dead
  too long to realize that?

946
00:59:50,906 --> 00:59:54,277
- Or perhaps alive too
  long to truly believe it.

947
00:59:54,277 --> 00:59:58,047
Well, I'm not dead yet.

948
00:59:58,047 --> 01:00:00,049
- I know. I realized that when

949
01:00:00,049 --> 01:00:02,485
I was watching you talk
to your cast tonight.

950
01:00:03,719 --> 01:00:05,855
- You mean my old
  shpeel, my shtick.

951
01:00:05,855 --> 01:00:09,158
- You were the old
  Kevin. Strong, confident.

952
01:00:09,158 --> 01:00:11,694
Inspiring others
with your ideas.

953
01:00:11,694 --> 01:00:15,998
Look, just do your
 job. Be their teacher,

954
01:00:15,998 --> 01:00:19,201
and stay the hell
 out of their lives.

955
01:00:20,236 --> 01:00:22,371
- Well you're one to talk.

956
01:00:23,472 --> 01:00:26,809
- I'm not like you
Kevin. I just play with

957
01:00:26,809 --> 01:00:30,446
their bodies, not
 fuck with their souls.

958
01:00:32,381 --> 01:00:34,216
- Such a bitch.

959
01:00:50,666 --> 01:00:52,835
- I haven't spoken about
the Kevin character

960
01:00:52,835 --> 01:00:55,171
mostly because I find him
  to be the most troubling.

961
01:00:58,340 --> 01:01:01,777
Now if I had the possibility
of celebrating my 60th birthday

962
01:01:03,679 --> 01:01:06,382
he's the man I fear
 I would become.

963
01:01:08,284 --> 01:01:10,619
An anguished, impotent
 artist who has

964
01:01:10,619 --> 01:01:13,355
survived long passed
his creative half life.

965
01:01:14,857 --> 01:01:16,826
Bitterly spending his
 autumn years teaching

966
01:01:16,826 --> 01:01:20,129
talentless rich kids at
some private college.

967
01:01:25,134 --> 01:01:28,938
Well, dying of cancer
 is a bitch but I,

968
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:34,076
I prefer my fate to
that of this character.

969
01:01:36,779 --> 01:01:39,648
The outliving of
 one's creative self.

970
01:01:46,422 --> 01:01:48,324
I'll let you guys
 decide for yourself

971
01:01:48,324 --> 01:01:50,926
whether or not that last
  statement is true or not.

972
01:01:55,097 --> 01:01:57,266
I'm not sure myself.

973
01:02:01,670 --> 01:02:03,472
(video camera beeps)

974
01:02:15,851 --> 01:02:18,621
I started making this
 video to talk about

975
01:02:18,621 --> 01:02:21,957
the characters and how they
 relate to their author.

976
01:02:23,459 --> 01:02:26,562
I mean, who knows,
  maybe this will

977
01:02:26,562 --> 01:02:29,098
be playing at my
  memorial service.

978
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:35,037
That said, the
 movie's conclusion,

979
01:02:35,037 --> 01:02:38,007
seeing between Wesley and Isaiah

980
01:02:38,007 --> 01:02:40,576
is one that speaks
  of the horror of

981
01:02:40,576 --> 01:02:43,813
having one's terrible
 desires fulfilled.

982
01:02:57,059 --> 01:02:58,727
(knocking)

983
01:02:58,727 --> 01:03:00,262
- [Wesley] Come in.

984
01:03:09,738 --> 01:03:11,273
- Hi.

985
01:03:11,273 --> 01:03:14,643
- Hey. I thought I
  was done but then

986
01:03:14,643 --> 01:03:16,846
I saw something that
 needed fixing, so.

987
01:03:18,247 --> 01:03:22,918
(sewing machine working)

988
01:03:25,354 --> 01:03:28,224
- Is this where your
 fantasy takes place?

989
01:03:30,159 --> 01:03:35,164
- Not exactly. Not in
 Kevin's studio at any rate.

990
01:03:36,332 --> 01:03:39,335
It was different.
  Look about that.

991
01:03:39,335 --> 01:03:42,805
I was drunk and high that night.

992
01:03:42,805 --> 01:03:45,708
I shouldn't have said
 those things to you.

993
01:03:45,708 --> 01:03:47,576
- How did you imagine it?

994
01:03:47,576 --> 01:03:49,578
- [Wesley] What?

995
01:03:49,578 --> 01:03:53,349
- The room. You said you
imagined it differently.

996
01:03:55,417 --> 01:03:57,620
- A dark grimy
  room with bolts of

997
01:03:57,620 --> 01:04:00,890
fabric everywhere
  like in El Paso.

998
01:04:00,890 --> 01:04:03,058
- [Isaiah] You did
 theater in El Paso?

999
01:04:03,058 --> 01:04:05,327
- Community theater,
 just costume

1000
01:04:05,327 --> 01:04:07,730
and stage hand stuff, you know.

1001
01:04:07,730 --> 01:04:10,132
I was stationed at Fort Bliss.

1002
01:04:10,132 --> 01:04:15,137
(Sewing machine working)

1003
01:04:18,307 --> 01:04:20,910
There. Done.

1004
01:04:34,456 --> 01:04:37,126
- You're not going
 to watch my undress?

1005
01:04:37,126 --> 01:04:39,695
- You can go in the
other room if you want.

1006
01:04:39,695 --> 01:04:43,499
- Uh uh. I want you to watch me.

1007
01:04:50,839 --> 01:04:52,841
- Nice underwear.

1008
01:04:52,841 --> 01:04:54,977
- Celia bought 'em for me.

1009
01:04:54,977 --> 01:04:56,812
- [Wesley] Figures.

1010
01:04:56,812 --> 01:05:00,516
- I'm like whatever,
never really thought of

1011
01:05:00,516 --> 01:05:02,785
underwear as being
 all that important.

1012
01:05:02,785 --> 01:05:05,087
- Neither did I.
  I always wore the

1013
01:05:05,087 --> 01:05:07,323
Sears brand growing
 up, still do.

1014
01:05:07,323 --> 01:05:09,658
I always thought they
  made me a third rate homo.

1015
01:05:14,463 --> 01:05:19,468
- I, uh, had a boyfriend
in high school.

1016
01:05:22,705 --> 01:05:25,074
- Oh yeah?

1017
01:05:26,375 --> 01:05:30,479
- Jacob and I, we were
supposed to go to NYU together,

1018
01:05:30,479 --> 01:05:34,483
after he finished his tam
  ritz studies in Israel.

1019
01:05:34,483 --> 01:05:36,752
- Didn't turn out
  that way did it?

1020
01:05:37,953 --> 01:05:41,357
- I think his parents
 suspected him, or us.

1021
01:05:43,659 --> 01:05:45,728
They ended up
 sending him to a real

1022
01:05:45,728 --> 01:05:48,030
conservative
 yeshivah in Tel Aviv.

1023
01:05:48,030 --> 01:05:49,164
- Damn.

1024
01:05:51,867 --> 01:05:55,037
- I heard the rabbi there
  is like a cult leader.

1025
01:05:56,939 --> 01:06:01,477
Jacob never came back.
Not to stay or anything.

1026
01:06:03,712 --> 01:06:08,550
I was afraid it would happen,
 but I knew that it would.

1027
01:06:10,185 --> 01:06:12,688
Deep down I think
 that he knew it too.

1028
01:06:14,023 --> 01:06:16,392
- That's crazy.

1029
01:06:16,392 --> 01:06:17,726
- About a year later
 we came to visit

1030
01:06:17,726 --> 01:06:20,729
his family during one
 of their holidays.

1031
01:06:20,729 --> 01:06:23,232
He hadn't written
  to me in months.

1032
01:06:23,232 --> 01:06:25,868
Thought, you know,
 hey maybe he couldn't.

1033
01:06:27,336 --> 01:06:31,807
I was so excited,
 so happy to see him.

1034
01:06:33,509 --> 01:06:35,477
- But what happened?

1035
01:06:38,247 --> 01:06:43,252
- His eyes were distant, he
 wouldn't even shake my hand.

1036
01:06:44,853 --> 01:06:48,424
He refused it right there in
 front of his whole family.

1037
01:06:48,424 --> 01:06:50,926
I mean, before he left
 I'd been with him.

1038
01:06:51,860 --> 01:06:56,565
I held him and I
kissed him, then

1039
01:06:56,565 --> 01:06:59,935
at the airport he just
looked right through me.

1040
01:06:59,935 --> 01:07:03,038
- Shit. That's horrible.

1041
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:14,349
- Well aren't you
 gonna check the fit?

1042
01:07:14,349 --> 01:07:17,086
- Yeah, I know it
 needs to be done up.

1043
01:07:17,086 --> 01:07:18,954
Take it up a few inches.

1044
01:07:20,689 --> 01:07:23,459
- Check it, please.

1045
01:07:37,272 --> 01:07:40,309
I was so pissed off
that night at Edward's.

1046
01:07:40,309 --> 01:07:42,177
- 'Cause of Celia and Rasheeq?

1047
01:07:42,177 --> 01:07:44,646
- 'Cause I felt like a fraud.

1048
01:07:46,415 --> 01:07:51,420
You have no idea how close I
was to fooling around with you.

1049
01:07:52,287 --> 01:07:53,489
I mean, I wouldn't have pursued

1050
01:07:53,489 --> 01:07:57,426
it or initiated anything but...

1051
01:07:57,426 --> 01:08:00,162
- You just would
 have let it happen?

1052
01:08:00,162 --> 01:08:02,564
- [Isaiah] Yeah.

1053
01:08:02,564 --> 01:08:04,833
- You like me touching you?

1054
01:08:04,833 --> 01:08:07,169
- Yes.

1055
01:08:07,169 --> 01:08:10,606
- So you're going to just
  let something happen now?

1056
01:08:10,606 --> 01:08:12,708
- Mm hmm.

1057
01:08:17,779 --> 01:08:20,516
- If we do this now
 it makes you a trick,

1058
01:08:20,516 --> 01:08:23,852
I want you to be more than
  that do you understand?

1059
01:08:23,852 --> 01:08:25,888
- Mm hmm.

1060
01:08:25,888 --> 01:08:29,591
- Drinks after
rehearsal? Maybe dinner?

1061
01:08:29,591 --> 01:08:32,027
- I'd like that.

1062
01:08:39,601 --> 01:08:41,670
- Better get out of here before

1063
01:08:41,670 --> 01:08:44,673
certain imaginations
 go into overdrive.

1064
01:08:52,247 --> 01:08:57,252
Don't stand me up, Isaiah. Okay?

1065
01:08:58,687 --> 01:09:03,258
I'm really looking forward to
 getting to know you better.

1066
01:09:16,004 --> 01:09:19,174
- Exterior. Theater.
 Night. Scene 73.

1067
01:09:19,174 --> 01:09:22,411
Busy east village street
  on a hot summer's evening.

1068
01:09:22,411 --> 01:09:25,447
Wesley exits the theater and
 looks around quickly spotting

1069
01:09:25,447 --> 01:09:28,050
the circle of actors
 assembled near the box office,

1070
01:09:28,050 --> 01:09:30,953
watching as they smoke and
  chat amongst themselves.

1071
01:09:30,953 --> 01:09:34,656
He catches sight of Isaiah and
 for a moment their eyes lock.

1072
01:09:34,656 --> 01:09:37,593
But the circle unwinds
 and Celia appears at

1073
01:09:37,593 --> 01:09:40,562
its center just before the
other actors begin to disperse.

1074
01:09:40,562 --> 01:09:43,966
In a display that
 Wesley understands is
 meant for him alone,

1075
01:09:43,966 --> 01:09:46,168
Isaiah puts his arm around Celia

1076
01:09:46,168 --> 01:09:48,470
and gives her a kiss
 on the forehead.

1077
01:09:48,470 --> 01:09:51,440
Wesley cracks a pained
 ironic smile as he

1078
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:54,109
watches them walk
  into the distance.

1079
01:09:59,848 --> 01:10:02,117
Although it's
 tragically obvious,

1080
01:10:02,117 --> 01:10:05,254
Wesley and Isaiah
  will never meet

1081
01:10:06,421 --> 01:10:09,091
even though that's
 what they both desire.

1082
01:10:10,425 --> 01:10:12,761
A chasm at once social, sexual,

1083
01:10:12,761 --> 01:10:15,330
and political that
  cannot be filled.

1084
01:10:33,448 --> 01:10:35,651
(knocking)

1085
01:10:51,533 --> 01:10:53,302
- Darwin!

1086
01:10:54,803 --> 01:10:56,738
- Maybe he's not in there.
  - [Wesley] He's in there.

1087
01:10:56,738 --> 01:10:59,775
- [Isaiah] How'd you know?
- [Wesley] I heard him talking.

1088
01:10:59,775 --> 01:11:03,812
- Stephen was right.
 It is bad faith.

1089
01:11:05,614 --> 01:11:10,452
- Darwin. Darwin!

1090
01:11:10,452 --> 01:11:14,323
- Dear God who slipped
 Pirandello into my morphine?

1091
01:11:14,323 --> 01:11:16,391
(knocking)

1092
01:11:16,391 --> 01:11:20,962
- Darwin! Come on
  man, let us in!

1093
01:11:20,962 --> 01:11:25,968
- Darwin, let them in.
  Let them bring us to life.

1094
01:11:27,636 --> 01:11:30,238
- The project's finished.

1095
01:11:30,238 --> 01:11:32,674
- Maybe he's having a seizure.

1096
01:11:32,674 --> 01:11:34,977
(knocking)

1097
01:11:34,977 --> 01:11:36,912
- [Rasheeq] Darwin!

1098
01:11:36,912 --> 01:11:40,015
- We deserve to exist
beyond your imagination.

1099
01:11:40,983 --> 01:11:43,885
- How could I become this?

1100
01:11:49,424 --> 01:11:52,361
Maybe I have outlived myself.

1101
01:11:55,297 --> 01:11:57,666
(knocking)

1102
01:11:57,666 --> 01:12:00,369
- Darwin!
