The patient won’t come to a Doctor

00:01:36,289 --> 00:01:38,284

Where did you plan the
operation theater?

34
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,441
On the first floor, sir

35
00:02:40,305 --> 00:02:42,782
I told you to plan it on
the ground floor, Change it

36
00:02:42,867 --> 00:02:44,981
Bring it to the ground floor
–it’s to late, sir

37
00:02:45,109 --> 00:02:46,713
Construction work has
already commenced

38
00:02:48,593 --> 00:02:51,523
But before the construction work
Has begun, in the final plan…

39
00:02:51,694 --> 00:02:54,094
The operation theater was supposed
to be on the ground floor

40
00:02:54,309 --> 00:02:56,432
Some complication had cropped
up and you were not available…

41
00:02:56,456 --> 00:02:58,900
But Mr.Chaturvedi
asked me to go ahead

42
00:02:59,105 --> 00:03:01,810
Who is Chaturvedi?
Go and get me Mr.Chaturvedi

43
00:03:02,734 --> 00:03:04,160
From the very begining
I been telling you,

44
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:07,830
I want this Operation theatre on the
ground floor and you..

45
00:03:09,961 --> 00:03:16,265
It’s me – Me, who?
Me! – Oh, well …go ahead

46
00:03:16,914 --> 00:03:19,911
I was taking a bath this morning
And you left without telling me

47
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:23,365
I told you I was In hurry, Is
this why you’ve called me?

48
00:03:24,214 --> 00:03:29,094
I have drawn a sketch, I want you
to see it, Will you come for lunch?

49
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:32,800
I could also have seen the
sketch in evening…You…

50
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:35,065
Yes Sir -One second

51
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,296
Did you tell him to shift the
operation theater to the first floor?

52
00:03:40,581 --> 00:03:41,741
Yes, sir -Why?

53
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:45,550
I thought it wouldn’t
make a difference

54
00:03:45,781 --> 00:03:49,183
What do you mean by that? As
a doctor, don’t you know…

55
00:03:49,317 --> 00:03:53,209
A patient could have loose his life during
an emergency? -I am sorry sir

56
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:58,570
Keep the plan with you
and let’s go to the site

57
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:05,605
Sunil, so many Indian doctors
have settled in the U.S.

58
00:07:05,999 --> 00:07:08,502
Why mustn’t I do the same thing?

59
00:07:08,776 --> 00:07:10,338
I think he is right, Sir
-Thank You

60
00:07:10,532 --> 00:07:13,620
Really? but the doctors
think like this…

61
00:07:14,306 --> 00:07:18,115
What will happen of India? -what
can you find here anyway?

62
00:07:18,264 --> 00:07:25,415
If I settle down there, I’ll get
a lot more money and facilities.

63
00:07:31,236 --> 00:07:33,110
And here we are facing
population explosion

64
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,612
If the population is more,
more people will be ill

65
00:07:35,868 --> 00:07:39,382
If the people are ill, more
doctors will be required

66
00:07:39,652 --> 00:07:45,621
And lady, here you can’t get
your work done by servants

67
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,462
Out there, you will have to
do everything on your own

68
00:07:50,718 --> 00:07:52,770
Not right away, We have
just arrived, You may eat

69
00:07:53,205 --> 00:07:54,205
That’s good, in fact

70
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:55,824
One need not go on a diet

71
00:07:59,367 --> 00:08:03,121
What are you doing? I have just started
This is my second drink

72
00:08:03,202 --> 00:08:04,834
Guys, this is my second drink, right?

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,776
Go ahead and eat. And
it’s only 10pm

74
00:08:07,929 --> 00:08:09,116
What are you going
to do at home?

75
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,431
You don’t want to show
me a new sketch, do you?

76
00:08:10,455 --> 00:08:14,879
Sketch?
- Oh Yes, Of late, she’s is very much

77
00:08:15,134 --> 00:08:18,021
Today I was very busy in
the hospital, she rang me up

78
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:19,474
I asked whether it was important

79
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:22,240
She said yes
“I got to show you anew sketch”

80
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:25,508
I have seen her paintings
a couple of times

81
00:08:26,058 --> 00:08:28,481
I didn’t know which
side to look it from

82
00:08:28,718 --> 00:08:33,715
Left, Right, Top or bottom? it
looked the same from everywhere

83
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,355
Are you angry with me?

84
00:09:06,054 --> 00:09:10,791
What’s up? You are so quite,
You just don’t speak

85
00:09:15,317 --> 00:09:18,459
If you don’t wish to talk,
May I get a book for you?

86
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,725

Why not? she is my sister in law,
means half wife

170
00:19:32,387 --> 00:19:35,566
Half Wife, tell same to Sunil,
he will shoot you

171
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,613
In salim's arm

172
00:19:57,441 --> 00:19:59,728
Anarkali will be bride of Hindustan

173
00:20:00,729 --> 00:20:03,291
Don't make dust of earth,
crown of head

174
00:20:04,698 --> 00:20:06,807
It is already done

175
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,293
I can see the Hindustan of
King Akbar

176
00:20:11,949 --> 00:20:14,824
Will accept you

177
00:20:17,324 --> 00:20:22,795
If King see me here, I will be
buried in your arms

178
00:20:23,342 --> 00:20:28,624
Love which is afraid is not love,
It's crime

179
00:20:32,869 --> 00:20:37,930
Salim, Your fearless love

180
00:20:38,725 --> 00:20:41,928
Challange to Moghal Empire

181
00:20:42,211 --> 00:20:44,055
Inspector

182
00:20:44,212 --> 00:20:45,446
What happened? Where is he?

183
00:20:46,149 --> 00:20:48,306
Arrest this girl

184
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:52,066
No, This is not possible,
till I am alive

185
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:57,300
Your impossible attempt,
is disobey of royal order

186
00:20:58,346 --> 00:21:05,293
I can't see this crime
-Stand up

187
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:08,981
If you love this servant

188
00:21:09,778 --> 00:21:12,668
Than you will have to try,
your full life

189
00:21:13,294 --> 00:21:17,153
Anarkali is not fit for you

190
00:21:17,659 --> 00:21:18,721
Why Not?

191
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:24,791
Because, for your love, can not change
destiny of Hindustan

192
00:21:25,261 --> 00:21:28,839
Everything changed

193
00:21:29,283 --> 00:21:31,470
But in this changing world

194
00:21:31,721 --> 00:21:36,189
You can not change your love

195
00:21:36,393 --> 00:21:40,948
But, Salim you have to change

196
00:21:45,886 --> 00:21:49,438
Aarti -Yes
-Aarti never loses

197
00:21:49,985 --> 00:21:53,079
You have done wonderful job
-You have done excellent

198
00:21:53,236 --> 00:21:56,141
You are good in dialouge
-What differnce it makes

199
00:21:56,314 --> 00:21:59,658
Many times you can express
youself without saying anything

200
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:03,886
You have said nothing but did
a good job -Thank You

201
00:22:13,714 --> 00:22:15,776
You did good job

202
00:22:22,416 --> 00:22:24,948
Vinod, even today you could not
tell her your feelings

203
00:22:25,446 --> 00:22:29,055
You speak well on stage, If you could speak
in real life, your work would have done

204
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:34,055
Uncle, I think today I should tell her

205
00:22:34,641 --> 00:22:39,031
Now love her in your dream,
-What do you mean

206
00:22:39,469 --> 00:22:42,016
I mean, her marrige is fixed

207
00:23:09,405 --> 00:23:11,233
Isn't it good place

208
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:19,786
In wet rain, in green hills,
train looks so beautiifull

209
00:23:20,536 --> 00:23:22,483
God knows, how many stories
hidden in it

210
00:23:23,062 --> 00:23:26,734
Everyday so many passnger traval
through this

211
00:23:27,109 --> 00:23:29,229
To take others to their
destination is its destination

212
00:23:33,984 --> 00:23:35,171
What are you thinking?

213
00:23:37,702 --> 00:23:39,420
You deliver dialogue very well

214
00:23:39,578 --> 00:23:41,906
Seems the habit of acting is not gone

215
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:46,984
How it can go, every person is actor,
you me we all

216
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,542
In drama of life everybody
has to do their role and go

217
00:23:51,215 --> 00:23:56,246
Yes, sound good -It's a fact

218
00:24:02,753 --> 00:24:04,927
Why you lauged
-It remind me college insident

219
00:24:05,052 --> 00:24:07,646
Do you remember you used
to deliver items on stage

220
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:11,099
I used to do lot, which one
you talking about

221
00:24:20,804 --> 00:24:25,928
Yes Mr. & Mrs. Laila Majnu
-Yes I got it

222
00:24:27,366 --> 00:24:28,929
Laila Majnu are married now

223
00:24:29,994 --> 00:24:34,806
It was their wedding night
With procession of mad people

224
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:42,526
Majnu says, come in arms

225
00:24:44,926 --> 00:24:51,661
Laila said first sew your torn cloths

226
00:24:53,331 --> 00:24:58,533
Love was dream, come into reality,
It seems got into trouble

227
00:24:59,321 --> 00:25:02,118
The question of earning started

228
00:25:02,789 --> 00:25:05,805
reminded of bread when felt hungry

229
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:09,735
Laila used to ask when Majnu
reaches home

230
00:25:11,375 --> 00:25:18,078
Even today we have come empty handed,
No ladyfingar, no cabbage, no pumpkin

231
00:25:18,514 --> 00:25:22,842
There is no chilli and no masala,
You put me in trouble

232
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:28,671
Laila do you want fight with me,
we have promised to love each other

233
00:25:29,084 --> 00:25:35,178
Shall I wear it or spread it your love,
what shold feed to our hungry kids

234
00:25:36,346 --> 00:25:41,221
Don't cry, till Majnu is alive
you don't have to worry

235
00:25:41,842 --> 00:25:44,158
This is Doctors Majnu’s house

236
00:25:44,404 --> 00:25:45,533
-Who is Majnu?

237
00:25:45,732 --> 00:25:48,385
I am sorry, this is doctor’s
Sunil’s house

238
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:55,797
What’s the matter?
You sound very happy

239
00:25:55,900 --> 00:26:00,578
No, that Majnu was…
- who is the Majnu?

240
00:26:00,878 --> 00:26:05,885
What I meant is that Vinod

241
00:26:06,278 --> 00:26:13,823
Why didn’t you tell me about it?
Doesn’t matte, Why did you call?

242
00:26:15,243 --> 00:26:19,056
Oh yes, I want to renew
My revolver license

243
00:26:19,429 --> 00:26:24,620
I looked eveywhere but couldn’t
findit, Could it be in you bag?

244
00:26:41,607 --> 00:26:43,728
Yes, I have it

245
00:26:44,017 --> 00:26:46,217
-Have it! You could have atleast
Told me before leaving

246
00:26:46,518 --> 00:26:51,370
That give you a reason to call
-I was going to call you anyway

247
00:26:51,698 --> 00:26:55,151
Listen, I told you yesterday
About Raju’s birthday

248
00:26:55,651 --> 00:26:58,508
Why don’t you come over? Sister
and brother in law would

249
00:26:58,676 --> 00:27:01,446

What do you mean by trying?

250
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:06,571

254
00:27:17,417 --> 00:27:22,365
Every morning brings new exaltation,
Gives message of good news

255
00:27:23,724 --> 00:27:27,818
You are having tea in Glass? -Cup
-I like tea in glass

256
00:27:28,787 --> 00:27:31,921
becuse first you get more tea in it,
secondly it remains hot for longer

257
00:27:32,193 --> 00:27:35,399

258
00:27:35,549 --> 00:27:38,237
Sister, this time we will celebrate
Raju's birtday here

259
00:27:38,533 --> 00:27:40,580

00:27:41,143 --> 00:27:42,612
It's OK, but -Yes Aunty

261
00:27:42,928 --> 00:27:48,256
But your house is not ready yet
-Don't worry, it will be ready by evening

262
00:27:48,973 --> 00:27:56,973
Come on Raju, Come on Raju..

263
00:27:58,379 --> 00:28:05,338
Come on Raju, Come on Raju..

What's going on? -Blink an eye
-Means?

265
00:28:09,432 --> 00:28:13,479
War of an eye, The one who will
blink an eye first will lose the game

266
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,119
And the one who will lose?

00:30:55,365 --> 00:30:58,631

295
00:30:58,788 --> 00:31:06,365
"They laugh even when broken"

296
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:14,216
"Who laugh in such style,

297
00:31:14,506 --> 00:31:17,833
"Remains in everybody's heart"

00:31:18,392 --> 00:31:29,687

"Speak, speak, life's gamut"

313
00:33:53,487 --> 00:33:56,706
Wait, I will just ask Mrs. Sunil Gupta
and let you know

314
00:33:58,254 --> 00:34:02,692
I can not stand anymore, Sister
-But

315
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,066
Sunil was not like that

316
00:34:06,876 --> 00:34:12,172
He was not, but now a day he
is so much lost in his own work

317
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:14,255
He has no value fore me

318
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:16,276
As if I do not exist

319
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:20,707
What are saying, Sunil has given
you everything

320
00:34:21,145 --> 00:34:23,770
Car, Bunglow...
- I did not ask for all these

321
00:34:23,907 --> 00:34:28,596
Sister, I'm not one of those women

322
00:34:29,971 --> 00:34:33,002
Who are satisfied with all these

323
00:34:33,706 --> 00:34:38,706
I just wanted his love, his company

324
00:34:40,214 --> 00:34:43,605
We were so happy in that small house

325
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:49,121
As wealth grows,
happiness gets away from me

326
00:34:49,661 --> 00:34:53,180
And the distance between us kept growing

327
00:34:53,837 --> 00:34:58,508
It was heard that after marriage,
the two get together

328
00:34:59,788 --> 00:35:05,626
But, we two remain two

329
00:35:06,574 --> 00:35:10,413
It was good to be alone

330
00:35:11,699 --> 00:35:15,184
No aarti, Don't feel so bad about it

331
00:35:17,217 --> 00:35:20,576
Sister, you won't understand

332
00:35:22,732 --> 00:35:27,001
The one who feels lonely knows

333
00:35:27,527 --> 00:35:29,308
What she goes through

334
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:34,532
You don't worry, this time
I personally come with you

335
00:35:35,183 --> 00:35:36,574
and explain Sunil

336
00:35:37,729 --> 00:35:40,901
No sister, that is of no use

337
00:35:41,433 --> 00:35:44,996
He should understand himself,
my pain

338
00:35:45,512 --> 00:35:47,164
I have decided

339
00:35:47,759 --> 00:35:55,728
Unless he come himself and take
me with him, I won't go from here

340
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:03,615
Rosy, Did you change it's location?
- No Sir

341
00:36:03,788 --> 00:36:07,897
If I change, madam will replace me
and send me to Goa

342
00:36:08,224 --> 00:36:11,924
So did it move by itself
-I think so -What?

343
00:36:12,175 --> 00:36:16,159
No Sir, Madam told watchman to keep it here

344
00:36:22,857 --> 00:36:24,810
Bahadur

345
00:36:27,278 --> 00:36:29,263
Get Ladder -I won't

346
00:36:29,529 --> 00:36:33,404
Why? -Once I climb the ladder
One person took away ladder

347
00:36:33,622 --> 00:36:36,402
Full day I was on top and
The mosquito ate me

348
00:36:36,591 --> 00:36:40,716
If you want I can get small table
-OK get that -I will get that

349
00:36:48,134 --> 00:36:51,618
Sister, can we go for picnic tomorrow?
- Not picnic, will go to see film

350
00:36:51,712 --> 00:36:55,946
No mom will go to see Circus
-Not at all -In circus there are lions

351
00:36:56,165 --> 00:36:59,192
No, No... there is lot of confusion

352
00:36:59,473 --> 00:37:01,941
We will make slips -wonderfull

353
00:37:02,051 --> 00:37:09,004
See in slip we will get Picture only

354
00:37:10,023 --> 00:37:18,023
Tell me what yours, spell the circus
Whereyou want to go?

355
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:24,905
Picnic -Aunty Circus -You?

356
00:37:25,124 --> 00:37:27,702
No mama circus -Keep quiet, You?

357
00:37:28,332 --> 00:37:32,786
I wanted to go for hunting, but
will go where my wife want to go

358
00:37:33,004 --> 00:37:38,020
Film -Major will go to see film,

359
00:37:40,623 --> 00:37:44,388

partner you select -Circus

362
00:37:53,799 --> 00:37:56,048
Well done, ley me read

00:37:56,607 --> 00:38:01,903
Let us see awesome slip
What is it? It's Picnic

364
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:07,044
Look, it's picnic -We lost hunting
as well as film

365
00:38:09,976 --> 00:38:15,914
If we are going for picnis, why don't
we go to Nandgaon? -Will go to Bhushi Dam

366
00:38:20,716 --> 00:38:25,200
Hunting, Hunting, you know anything else

367
00:38:26,613 --> 00:38:29,723
Raju, why are sitting sad
-He exactly like his mother

368
00:38:30,017 --> 00:38:33,486
Your partner only removed the slip,

369
00:38:33,627 --> 00:38:39,593
Will show you elephant, hourse, camal,

00:38:39,922 --> 00:38:47,562
So tomorrow at what time?-At 9:30
-Ok Raju tomorrow at 9:30 sharp

371
00:38:48,771 --> 00:38:53,005
My big rose -Yes
-It smells good

372
00:38:53,334 --> 00:38:56,365
Just open the lid, let me test it
-What are you doing?

373
00:38:56,506 --> 00:38:57,912
You can not test it

374
00:38:58,272 --> 00:39:01,256
Rosy -Whenever I try to test it
someone comes in

375
00:39:03,485 --> 00:39:07,110
Is food ready, It ready from tomorrow,
-What? -I mean it's from long

376
00:39:08,391 --> 00:39:12,906
Good morning, Good morning everybody,
lovely weather no rain, everything ready

377
00:39:13,094 --> 00:39:15,450
Where is Majer?
- Good morning

378
00:39:16,279 --> 00:39:20,825
Good Morning -Army man never late
-Good Morning sir

379
00:39:21,903 --> 00:39:24,325
Where is Sister & Raju?
- There is small problem

380
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:29,506
Raju got wet in rain yesterday so he
is having fever, if goes out it may incrase

381
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:37,316
Let's go and see him -No no hold on
Somehave I manage to convence him

382
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:39,566
If you go, he will again start crying

383
00:39:39,863 --> 00:39:42,550
You both carry on,
What say Vinod?

384
00:39:43,291 --> 00:39:47,134
I don't get into fight of sis and bro
in law, if you want we will put slips

385
00:39:47,571 --> 00:39:51,535
There is no need of slips
-Correct, no need of slips

386
00:39:52,504 --> 00:39:54,848
Brother in law, picnic cancelled

387
00:39:55,165 --> 00:39:58,607
That's right, picnic cancelled
-Why to cancelled picnic for this

388
00:39:58,672 --> 00:40:00,272
This is also right,
why to cancell picnic?

389
00:40:00,453 --> 00:40:03,180
It doesn't look nice, there is
more fun, if we go together

390
00:40:03,515 --> 00:40:05,782
This is also right, we all shold
go together

391
00:40:06,108 --> 00:40:10,522
Aarti, you rearly come to this place,
we have gone there many times

392
00:40:11,051 --> 00:40:13,090
This is also right, they
have gone there many times

393
00:40:13,402 --> 00:40:17,059
Now I am not going to remove my
glasses any more, decide fast

394
00:40:17,213 --> 00:40:20,277
You both just go -let's go

395
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:22,059
Good -She is gone

396
00:40:24,415 --> 00:40:26,837
Even after retirment, your habit
of giving orders not gone

397
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:31,462
You sent her alone -How alone?
Vinod is also with her

398
00:40:32,323 --> 00:40:35,245
So what? Aarti is our responsibility

399
00:40:35,696 --> 00:40:37,736
If Sunil comes to know about it,
what will he think?

400
00:40:37,927 --> 00:40:39,864
But you were saying,
Both studied together

401
00:40:40,314 --> 00:40:43,476
May be, but now Aarti is married

402
00:40:43,551 --> 00:40:46,976
After marriage, women become more
intelligent, except you

403
00:40:47,304 --> 00:40:48,413
What did you say?

404
00:40:48,602 --> 00:40:52,570
Nothing, speak softly, Raju will get up
Don't talk

405
00:40:55,001 --> 00:40:57,876
Don't know, Where both will be
roaming alone?

406
00:40:58,547 --> 00:41:02,750
Listen one more, in winter a person
was giving bath to his cat

407
00:41:03,891 --> 00:41:09,094
A passerby said, cat will die in this cold

408
00:41:09,763 --> 00:41:12,263
He said go away and let
me do my job

409
00:41:13,748 --> 00:41:17,513
second is person went away,
After some time

410
00:41:17,715 --> 00:41:22,371
Same person saw, the first person
crying carrying cat on his lap

411
00:41:22,843 --> 00:41:25,359
I had told, she will die

412
00:41:25,686 --> 00:41:30,952
he said she died by not bathing
by squeezing

413
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:34,480
What's wrong, I keep on talking
and you are so quiet

414
00:41:34,963 --> 00:41:36,940
If you wanted to be so silent,
why did you come for picnic?

415
00:41:36,964 --> 00:41:37,995
Picnic was just a excuse

416
00:41:38,339 --> 00:41:41,073
I had heard, Here a monk lives,
who is good at hand reading

417
00:41:41,604 --> 00:41:43,839
Not met -How not met?

418
00:41:44,385 --> 00:41:50,596
That wise man is in front of you

419
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:57,164
Anything -Show me your hand, till date,
whatever was told has come true

420
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:04,445
What a lines? You have age of 99

421
00:42:04,914 --> 00:42:08,664
The line of fate is so strong,
Whoever comes near becomes lucky

422
00:42:09,132 --> 00:42:13,757
But, But, Shadow of saturn on mars

423
00:42:14,203 --> 00:42:20,359
Got nothing even after having everything,
that's why mind is worried

424
00:42:20,531 --> 00:42:23,500
But, thumb is straight

425
00:42:24,039 --> 00:42:28,155
That means will power
-What? -self power

426
00:42:28,343 --> 00:42:31,811
whatever you think, you do it
-Yes -Yes

427
00:42:33,001 --> 00:42:39,173
your hand shows, it's going to rain now
-You are lying -I am not lying, you saw

428
00:42:42,892 --> 00:42:46,605
You will get wet -I don't need this
-Take it

429
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:51,809
You -Don't worry, I am waterproof,
you will get wet, wear it

430
00:42:56,809 --> 00:43:00,028
The rain is increasing
-Yes, it is increasing

431
00:43:00,438 --> 00:43:02,484
Keep raining...

432
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:06,515
You are really crazy, rain is already
increasing and you are singing for rain

433
00:43:07,062 --> 00:43:10,718
OK than, I will sing to stop the rain
Do not rain...

434
00:43:11,094 --> 00:43:13,169
Ever in your life you were serious

435
00:43:14,941 --> 00:43:20,066
Aarti, if person is always appears happy,
that does not mean he has no sadness

436
00:43:20,784 --> 00:43:24,456
What can make you sad, You are alone,
you don't have anybody

437
00:43:24,791 --> 00:43:26,259
May be that is the reason

438
00:43:27,281 --> 00:43:30,687
Sadness can be shared,
Someone has said it correct

439
00:43:31,341 --> 00:43:36,655
You share your happiness, it gets double
and if you share your sorrows it gets half

440
00:43:37,077 --> 00:43:40,184
But, With whom to share
-Find someone

441
00:43:41,098 --> 00:43:45,530
Don't get so easily -If you try sincerely
you will definitely get

442
00:43:50,567 --> 00:43:53,052
Rain Stopped, Let's go

443
00:44:06,156 --> 00:44:07,874
God bless you

444
00:44:08,184 --> 00:44:10,246
Appearing waterproof,
You realised now

445
00:44:11,029 --> 00:44:14,889
What is this -tea with ginger
Medicine for cold

446
00:44:16,249 --> 00:44:19,061
Tell me one thing, When you got married

447
00:44:19,404 --> 00:44:22,999
Then your husband put the garland
or stethoscope

448
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:25,015
You became doctor -quiet

449
00:44:25,578 --> 00:44:28,437
Is it must -Absolutely must

450
00:44:35,087 --> 00:44:37,244
Wow, I enjoyed
-Than why you were acting

451
00:44:37,475 --> 00:44:41,647
Mind was seeking happiness
-Yes I was, But..

452
00:44:41,806 --> 00:44:43,978
But means, I mean

453
00:44:44,962 --> 00:44:48,915
Why you came yourself,
could have sent through someone

454
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:51,696
Why, you were not keeping well,
What is wrong If I get it

455
00:44:52,462 --> 00:44:53,524
Nothing happened

456
00:44:55,073 --> 00:44:56,385
Realized one thing

457
00:44:57,510 --> 00:44:59,182
You must have someone

458
00:45:02,534 --> 00:45:06,252
That's why I am saying,
make someone yours quickly

459
00:45:11,096 --> 00:45:13,003
A wise companion should also be found

460
00:45:14,424 --> 00:45:15,503
You will get it

461
00:45:17,365 --> 00:45:18,802
it's not that easy

462
00:45:20,523 --> 00:45:22,226
Find the right partner at the right time

463
00:45:22,882 --> 00:45:24,226
It's a coincidence

464
00:45:26,443 --> 00:45:29,208
See, If you meet someone sometimes

465
00:45:30,163 --> 00:45:32,663
Within two to four days it seems
like you know for years

466
00:45:33,341 --> 00:45:37,231
And sometimes even after staying
together for years

467
00:45:38,076 --> 00:45:45,466
Kept reading book of life and
never came to know the story

468
00:45:56,389 --> 00:46:00,609
Listen, there is more tea in thermos,
If you want you can have it

469
00:46:06,298 --> 00:46:11,321
How is Raju? You know kids
get seek fast and get well soon

470
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:16,575
Hello, God morning everybody
-Good morning -Good morning Vinod

471
00:46:16,737 --> 00:46:19,752
How are you -Fine -How
was picnic? -first class

472
00:46:20,831 --> 00:46:23,471
still sneezing, Why didn't you
wear a sweater? -It's nothing

473
00:46:24,332 --> 00:46:28,175
the only medicine for cold is two
large whisky, What say major?

474
00:46:28,409 --> 00:46:31,894
Correct, I too.. -Major, Hats off to Aarti

475
00:46:32,442 --> 00:46:36,036
Yesterday we walk too far, but she did
not tired -Why? You forgot

476
00:46:36,567 --> 00:46:38,552
Aarti never loses

477
00:46:39,857 --> 00:46:45,124
After all, she is my sister in law
of army man

478
00:46:45,990 --> 00:46:49,959
That means major, you are taking
credit of this -Why not?

479
00:46:50,484 --> 00:46:52,531
I chose Sunil for her

480
00:46:52,749 --> 00:46:54,109
I got her bungalow

481
00:46:54,294 --> 00:46:59,341
I fixed it and it's decoration etc..
-That was by me

482
00:46:59,606 --> 00:47:02,091
That's true, but hurry up, it
taking long time

483
00:47:02,607 --> 00:47:05,623
Major this is not like fighting,
to happen fast

484
00:47:05,955 --> 00:47:08,940
It's a matter of art, slowly...

485
00:47:09,622 --> 00:47:10,841
Even we are not in hurry

486
00:47:13,701 --> 00:47:17,513
Saw, she understand it
-Listen

487
00:47:19,496 --> 00:47:24,074
You are leaving? -No major it's not
like that -Why brother in law?

488
00:47:24,813 --> 00:47:29,143
What is the matter -Aarti you won't
understand, this person sometime

489
00:47:29,461 --> 00:47:34,133
has a habit of disappearing
-No major no slander

490
00:47:35,541 --> 00:47:38,427
Very intresting person -Yes
-Laughing most of the time

491
00:47:41,784 --> 00:47:43,412
Aarti, just listen

492
00:47:43,938 --> 00:47:46,918
You shoul not mix up with unknown man
-What sister, you too...

493
00:47:47,041 --> 00:47:49,308
Speak softly -You started lecture

494
00:47:49,576 --> 00:47:52,966
It's not lecture, I know you have
habit of talking friendly

495
00:47:53,082 --> 00:47:55,660
But, you don't know, what is in
his mind? -Sister I am not a kid

496
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:58,141
Speak softly -Mummy my bat
broke down

497
00:47:58,278 --> 00:47:59,958
Ok, we will get new one
-When will you get?

498
00:48:00,113 --> 00:48:02,481
You told me to give Camera on Birthday
that is also not given -Go and paly

499
00:48:02,505 --> 00:48:04,547
Raju dear, how are you?
- Fine

500
00:48:04,704 --> 00:48:07,503
I am going to give you, your
mom will not give you anything

501
00:48:07,754 --> 00:48:09,270
No need to give me...
- Shooo...

502
00:48:09,445 --> 00:48:12,288
You will spoil his habits -Yes

503
00:48:15,998 --> 00:48:18,654
It's nice, isn't it, take this money

504
00:48:19,996 --> 00:48:23,059
You, What are doing here?

505
00:48:23,928 --> 00:48:27,819
In photo studio, certainly not to

Oho Partner, You are here

00:49:00,523 --> 00:49:02,304

00:49:06,008 --> 00:49:09,461
Let's have it -Withdraw money

00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,425
I am the master, give me my fees,
you feed me corn

517
00:49:13,289 --> 00:49:16,679
Have you run out of money?

518
00:49:17,597 --> 00:49:21,048
Will play eye fight -let's play
-Whoever lose will feed corn

519
00:49:21,204 --> 00:49:24,048
Agree. -Agree, Ok

520
00:49:44,309 --> 00:49:48,637
Oh.. you lost -No friend
You made me laugh, it's cheating

521
00:49:48,811 --> 00:49:53,280
No No.. I have not done any cheating,
-Look aunty friend is cheating me

522
00:49:53,639 --> 00:49:57,079
What cheating -you cheated him
I saw it -What I did?

523
00:49:57,361 --> 00:49:59,361
You were not making strange
faces to make him laugh

524
00:50:00,962 --> 00:50:04,523
First of all you are playing with kids,
on top of that doing cheating with them

525
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:08,914
You are not a kid, let's play
-Yes aunty let's play

526
00:50:12,043 --> 00:50:13,887
Let's play -Ok start

One Two Three start

528
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:23,184
Do you remember,
Aarti never looses

529
00:50:23,863 --> 00:50:27,300
Let us see, who wins and
who looses

530
00:50:39,062 --> 00:50:43,030
What happened? Show me,
let me see

531
00:50:53,790 --> 00:50:56,180
Come on, feed us corn
- Why should I?

532
00:50:56,949 --> 00:50:59,167
What do you mean by Why?
You lost the game

533
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:01,807
You are forcing me,
-Yes forcing you

534
00:51:02,073 --> 00:51:04,683
Come on, give is corns,
Give us three forcefully corn

Put some lime on it, give lime to me

536
00:51:23,752 --> 00:51:27,829
What are looking at?-
You looks like a kid

537
00:51:30,174 --> 00:51:32,502
Childhood is so good

538
00:51:33,598 --> 00:51:41,567
Really, childhood days are the best,
not aware of troubles of life

539
00:51:43,150 --> 00:51:50,801
Sometimes I feel like going back
into my old days and restart as new

540
00:52:02,195 --> 00:52:04,476
What? Miscarriage

541
00:52:04,823 --> 00:52:06,672
I am sorry, I could not
save the baby

542
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,425
How is Aarti? -She is fine

543
00:52:13,859 --> 00:52:16,222
Sunil, it would be
better if you plan

544
00:52:16,435 --> 00:52:18,988
Your next child after some years

545
00:52:57,419 --> 00:52:59,966
It’s not your fault at all..

546
00:53:01,763 --> 00:53:05,400
Maybe it’s not in our destiny so soon..

547
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:16,072
You can atleast cry, You don’t know
what I am going Through

548
00:53:17,369 --> 00:53:19,276
I can’t even cry

549
00:53:28,292 --> 00:53:36,407
To forget this trauma, we will
Have to support each other

550
00:53:49,544 --> 00:53:52,810
Hello -Hello It’s me

551
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:59,310
Why did you hang up?
Are you angry?

552
00:54:01,447 --> 00:54:04,364
I wanted to get there and
give you a surprise

553
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:13,155
Are you coming? -and listen

554
00:54:13,593 --> 00:54:15,856
the food ought to be just great

555
00:54:16,903 --> 00:54:18,278
Shall I invite my sister
And brother-in-law?

556
00:54:18,332 --> 00:54:26,949
No, only me and you tonight
I will be there by eight

557
00:54:28,071 --> 00:54:33,071
Are you sure? -what?
Be here by eight -okay

558
00:54:34,603 --> 00:54:40,026
Thank god, you checked my diary
and told me, What’s my schedule today?

559
00:54:40,164 --> 00:54:42,920
You got an appointment with
Doctor Prakash at 7.30 pm

560
00:55:43,633 --> 00:55:47,751
Let me pour you another drink
-No Prakash, it’s already late

561
00:55:48,282 --> 00:55:50,642
Why is Sinha talking so long?

562
00:55:51,165 --> 00:55:53,505
Did you tell him, I have to go
to Khandala after the meeting?

563
00:55:53,699 --> 00:55:57,136
Yes sir, he had told me that,
he will come by 7.30pm

564
00:55:58,605 --> 00:56:01,515
It’s already 8.30pm -you may
go if you are getting late..

565
00:56:01,587 --> 00:56:03,976
When sinha comes, he will
Explain to me the plan

566
00:56:05,406 --> 00:56:08,220
Go and find out why
He’s getting late

567
00:56:09,262 --> 00:56:13,272
Prakash I don’t trust this man
He is already messed up earlier

568
00:56:13,844 --> 00:56:17,439
What? He has not come yet?
If he comes tell him

569
00:56:17,582 --> 00:56:19,902
We are waiting for him and he should
reach here immediately

570
00:56:24,393 --> 00:56:25,793
Let me fill your glass atleast now

571
00:57:53,671 --> 00:57:55,640
Good Evening Sir, Good Evening?

572
00:57:55,996 --> 00:58:01,312
It’s 10.30pm in the night. I
forgot to carry plan with me

573
00:58:01,461 --> 00:58:04,106
When I went home and so… It’s okay
Don’t waste time

574
00:58:04,317 --> 00:58:06,575
Let’s get stared

575
00:58:45,787 --> 00:58:47,045
Stop

576
00:58:48,219 --> 00:58:49,673
Aarti, where are you going
so late in the night

577
00:58:49,821 --> 00:58:53,829
Going to Hell, Move on please
-What Happan Aarti?

578
00:59:01,701 --> 00:59:02,950
What are you doing Aarti?

579
00:59:05,562 --> 00:59:07,467
Drive Slowly

582
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:23,673
Have you gone mad?

583
00:59:46,443 --> 00:59:47,443
Aarti

584
00:59:51,506 --> 00:59:52,529
Aarti

585
00:59:54,074 --> 00:59:55,074

01:00:15,993 --> 01:00:18,743
Leave me, Leave me
-What has happaned to you?

590
01:00:43,284 --> 01:00:45,268
Aarti, Sorry

591
01:00:45,487 --> 01:00:48,252
What did I dream and What I Got

592
01:00:48,485 --> 01:00:51,196
I did not ask lot from life

593
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:55,177
Just sought company and love

594
01:00:56,015 --> 01:00:57,765
Did not get even that

595
01:00:58,086 --> 01:01:00,093
That doesn's mean,
you hate your life

596
01:01:01,037 --> 01:01:03,959
Is life called breathing

597
01:01:04,930 --> 01:01:07,494
My life is such a dark night

598
01:01:08,666 --> 01:01:11,422
No matter how long and ldark the night is

599
01:01:12,024 --> 01:01:13,253
The morning definitely comes

600
01:01:14,428 --> 01:01:16,296
And than you used to always says

601
01:01:16,978 --> 01:01:18,249
Aarti never loses

602
01:01:18,648 --> 01:01:20,339
Lost so soon?

603
01:01:23,829 --> 01:01:27,578
You are right, I can live
I will live

604
01:01:28,622 --> 01:01:30,113
Will fight alone with the world

605
01:01:30,897 --> 01:01:33,176
Alone -No Aarti

606
01:01:34,535 --> 01:01:37,880
You are not alone, Aarti

607
01:01:40,305 --> 01:01:41,655
let us go back

608
01:02:24,536 --> 01:02:25,536
Good morning

01:02:41,944 --> 01:02:44,792
Will you have tea?

610
01:02:46,532 --> 01:02:47,611

01:02:50,132 --> 01:02:51,879
I will get the tea

612
01:03:11,767 --> 01:03:13,365
Aarti, I could not sleep all night

613
01:03:14,584 --> 01:03:15,812
Kept thinking about you

614
01:03:19,988 --> 01:03:21,621
was thinking

615
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:26,713
Work is over and I have to go

616
01:03:28,537 --> 01:03:30,064
I was thinking

617
01:03:31,936 --> 01:03:32,936
You also

618
01:03:34,842 --> 01:03:37,611
I want to... -Madam

619
01:03:38,076 --> 01:03:41,215
Bus goes in the evening from here
I told you I have to go

620
01:03:42,434 --> 01:03:42,952
You can go

621
01:03:43,376 --> 01:03:45,321
If I can get some money

622
01:03:45,527 --> 01:03:47,210
You need money? -Yes
-Come with me

623
01:04:04,394 --> 01:04:06,394
Sir, the telephone line to
Khandala is out of order

624
01:04:06,864 --> 01:04:08,881
Okay, I will try
again This evening

625
01:04:09,064 --> 01:04:12,404
I won’t he here for 3-4 days
You take care of the hospital

626
01:04:12,523 --> 01:04:13,525
Right Sir,
-Doctor

627
01:04:13,672 --> 01:04:15,955
Don’t worry, the
operation was successful

628
01:04:16,759 --> 01:04:18,416
Ok Madam, I am leaving

629
01:04:18,622 --> 01:04:20,234
In such heavy rain
-I have umbrella

630
01:04:20,458 --> 01:04:21,458
OK, take care

631
01:04:22,248 --> 01:04:24,543
Madam, Vinod sir has given letter
for you

632
01:04:24,887 --> 01:04:25,938
Letter? -Yes

633
01:04:26,450 --> 01:04:27,450
OK, Madam

634
01:04:34,171 --> 01:04:37,332
You will surprised to have this letter

635
01:04:37,973 --> 01:04:38,973
Matter is like that

636
01:04:39,658 --> 01:04:42,138
Even after staying nearby and
meeting daily, why I wrote letter

637
01:04:43,171 --> 01:04:47,058
The thing which I could not tell in
the college, which remains in my heart

638
01:04:47,325 --> 01:04:51,216
Could not express so far, at last
I had to take help of pen

639
01:04:52,056 --> 01:04:55,095
Aarti, we have met once again,
in our second phase of life

640
01:04:55,938 --> 01:04:59,203
We stayed together for few days,
got chance to understand each other

641
01:05:00,022 --> 01:05:02,460
Came to know, how lonely you
are in your life

642
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:06,900
You are still alone,
even after getting married

643
01:05:07,274 --> 01:05:09,172
Something missing,
even after having everything

644
01:05:09,634 --> 01:05:10,352
Why is it so?

645
01:05:10,601 --> 01:05:12,640
I understand your helplessness

646
01:05:13,045 --> 01:05:16,643
And as much as I understand,
I feel so close to you

647
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:20,548
If you wish, I can get new
life for you

648
01:05:26,107 --> 01:05:28,005
Just need your signal

649
01:05:28,374 --> 01:05:32,069
If you are afraid of making a decision,
Than I can support you

650
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:34,771
I can face every trouble for your happiness

651
01:05:35,593 --> 01:05:36,765
Your Vinod

652
01:06:04,213 --> 01:06:07,970
Yes this is Arti here,
Wher are you?

653
01:06:12,482 --> 01:06:13,810
From Where?

654
01:06:16,373 --> 01:06:18,248
I can't hear you,
please speak loudly

655
01:06:26,553 --> 01:06:28,732
I understand your helplessness, Aarti

656
01:06:32,042 --> 01:06:35,362
If you wish, I can get new
life for you

657
01:06:37,482 --> 01:06:41,654
If you are afraid of making a decision,
Than I can support you

658
01:06:49,059 --> 01:06:52,481
Bahadur, Rosy

659
01:06:53,565 --> 01:06:55,103
Bahadur -Dr. Sunil

660
01:06:55,751 --> 01:06:57,427
Who are you? -Vinod

661
01:06:57,785 --> 01:07:00,260
I see, the interior decorator

662
01:07:00,825 --> 01:07:04,385
I will meet Aarti and come
-Do you care about Aarti?

663
01:07:05,815 --> 01:07:09,269
Why? What happened to her? -how
can you care mental illness?

664
01:07:10,078 --> 01:07:12,238
But then, you don’t have a
mental Relationship with her

665
01:07:13,345 --> 01:07:16,297
What do you want to say? -that
which aarti couldn’t tell you

666
01:07:17,006 --> 01:07:20,873
How could she tell you something
That she couldn’t tell me?

667
01:07:21,245 --> 01:07:25,745
You have been called here to
Decorate the house, not to break it

668
01:07:25,911 --> 01:07:27,891
A house isn’t a house just
Because it has been decorated

669
01:07:28,453 --> 01:07:31,631
I see? -A house is
made of love..

670
01:07:31,712 --> 01:07:33,227
Sharing happiness and sadness,
Supporting each other in hardships

671
01:07:33,281 --> 01:07:35,032
And those are the things that
were never given to her by you

672
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:36,944
Shut up.. -It’s true

673
01:07:37,011 --> 01:07:39,209
It’s a fact, If you don’t
Believe me, ask her.

674
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:53,359
Its true, Aarti? Don’t
be scared Aarti

675
01:07:53,641 --> 01:07:56,149
Tell him everything today

676
01:07:56,648 --> 01:08:00,325
Tell him how happy And
peacefull you are

677
01:08:00,767 --> 01:08:04,258
Tell him you were so happy that
You tried to commit suicide

678
01:08:04,625 --> 01:08:05,680
Tell him

679
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:19,243
Is it true?
Answer me? Is it true?

680
01:08:51,285 --> 01:08:53,027
Sister -tell me

681
01:08:53,558 --> 01:08:54,558
What is the matter?

682
01:08:55,636 --> 01:08:58,316
For tonight come and slip with me

683
01:08:59,363 --> 01:09:03,134
Rosy is also not there,
Alone I'm scared, stormy night

684
01:09:03,336 --> 01:09:04,970
You come here

685
01:09:05,182 --> 01:09:08,682
No, Sunil had called, He is on his
way, any moment he can come

686
01:09:09,377 --> 01:09:12,472
OK than I will come after Raju
sleeps -OK, come soon

687
01:09:55,538 --> 01:09:57,037
I knew, You will come

688
01:10:00,667 --> 01:10:04,581
Got the letter? -Yes, I am
here answer that letter

689
01:10:10,331 --> 01:10:15,002
You decorated house, it's your fees,
-Fees?

690
01:10:18,375 --> 01:10:22,469
But the love it is decorated with,
Can't be settle with the money

691
01:10:23,855 --> 01:10:28,342
Yes, You have got money in
return of Love

692
01:10:29,033 --> 01:10:30,111
May be because of that

693
01:10:31,235 --> 01:10:32,869
I thought -I understand everything

694
01:10:33,447 --> 01:10:36,626
Aarti, I want to share your sorrows
By supporting you

695
01:10:36,877 --> 01:10:39,447
I have already given this rights
-But it can be taken back

696
01:10:39,891 --> 01:10:43,835
Such rights can't be taken back,
Whom I have made my principles

697
01:10:45,168 --> 01:10:47,739
Principles, which doesn't have feelings
for your pain

698
01:10:48,075 --> 01:10:50,731
Whose negligence forced you to make suicide

699
01:10:51,035 --> 01:10:53,549
In whose eyes the value of your love,
Nothing except money

700
01:10:53,737 --> 01:10:55,987
This money has made you blind
-You are blind

701
01:10:56,490 --> 01:11:00,095
You need the light, you will get
only darkness in this house

702
01:11:00,398 --> 01:11:02,525
Go away from here
-Aarti

703
01:11:06,465 --> 01:11:07,496
Aarti

704
01:11:10,627 --> 01:11:13,127
Aarti, Listen to me -I don't want
to listen anything from you

705
01:11:13,752 --> 01:11:14,752
Didn't you say,

706
01:11:15,174 --> 01:11:18,658
In few days we will start understanding
each other very well

707
01:11:18,931 --> 01:11:21,409
We can start a new life,
Didn't you say that

708
01:11:23,469 --> 01:11:25,983
No partner, no love

709
01:11:26,307 --> 01:11:28,886
If you try sincerely you will
definitely get your partner

710
01:11:29,534 --> 01:11:32,299
Aarti, didn't you say that?
- Yes I said that

711
01:11:33,352 --> 01:11:37,851
Unknowingly to lighten my mind
I said that, but you misunderstood

712
01:11:39,562 --> 01:11:42,370
Lie has many faces,
Just one of the truth

713
01:11:42,613 --> 01:11:44,370
I never told you a lie

714
01:11:44,950 --> 01:11:48,262
But, What you wanted to understand,
that you understood in your own way

715
01:11:48,474 --> 01:11:51,046
No, I understood it correctly Aarti

716
01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:55,296
You are running from truth, You are
scared

717
01:11:56,176 --> 01:11:59,536
you want to Suicide due to
pressure from society

718
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:01,504
I will never live like that

719
01:12:02,027 --> 01:12:03,965
I will now never allow you to
do that

720
01:12:04,621 --> 01:12:05,699
You have to decide it now

721
01:12:06,133 --> 01:12:07,438
Today just now

722
01:12:08,656 --> 01:12:09,656

728
01:12:43,158 --> 01:12:44,541
I can kill myself

729
01:12:45,875 --> 01:12:47,086
What are you doing

730
01:12:47,977 --> 01:12:51,445

731
01:12:52,096 --> 01:12:54,861
Let me die

732
01:13:29,816 --> 01:13:37,333
Frightened?
You! -Who else can touch you?

733
01:13:42,179 --> 01:13:43,297
What are you looking at?

734
01:13:44,740 --> 01:13:48,673
I was stuck in the storm
Look at my condition

735
01:13:49,235 --> 01:13:52,518
I look like a ghost
I will freshen up

736

737
01:14:06,845 --> 01:14:08,380

01:14:55,765 --> 01:14:59,164
Police, If the police come

742
01:15:00,195 --> 01:15:01,991
No, No, No...

743
01:15:08,177 --> 01:15:10,810

744
01:15:11,706 --> 01:15:16,542

Let me take a look at you, Wow!

748
01:16:43,663 --> 01:16:49,623
You took a long time to come
-Be thankful I came

749
01:16:56,395 --> 01:17:00,342
Can I ask you something?
I am famished

750
01:17:00,948 --> 01:17:02,832
I am starving since last night..

751
01:17:51,758 --> 01:17:53,758
Has Sunil arrived?

752
01:17:56,157 --> 01:17:58,594
Don't cry, Aarti

753
01:17:59,498 --> 01:18:02,951
Don't cry, Aarti

754
01:18:05,938 --> 01:18:09,094
Sister, what has happened

755
01:18:09,422 --> 01:18:13,785
Looks like... Whenever
Happiness comes near me

756
01:18:16,177 --> 01:18:19,906
Why does this happen to me

757
01:18:20,819 --> 01:18:23,538
Be brave

758
01:18:23,983 --> 01:18:28,061
The more you think about it,
the more upset you will be

759
01:18:30,312 --> 01:18:34,804
I also tremble when I think about it

760
01:18:35,180 --> 01:18:36,625
The brain doesn't work

761
01:18:38,884 --> 01:18:40,868
This we can not even tell anyone

762
01:18:41,970 --> 01:18:43,056
If anyone comes to know

763
01:18:44,077 --> 01:18:46,312
Then your life will be ruined

764
01:18:47,041 --> 01:18:51,262
Respect of our house,
Sunil's big name...

765
01:18:51,590 --> 01:18:57,699
But Sister, How can I hide it from him

766
01:19:00,144 --> 01:19:04,769
Tell me -No No.. Don't
tell anything to Sunil

767
01:19:05,813 --> 01:19:09,267
Even if he gets suspicious
But then, he was

768
01:19:09,986 --> 01:19:14,392
Your college mate..
What will sunil think?

769
01:19:15,673 --> 01:19:19,630
He will lose his trust in you

770
01:19:21,232 --> 01:19:25,444
I don’t know what to do -Make it fast!
I am starved

771
01:19:25,647 --> 01:19:27,272

The weather here is peculiar
Last night there was a storm and

01:19:55,753 --> 01:19:57,553
Today there’s bright
sunshine Its normal here

01:19:57,692 --> 01:19:59,926
Yes, Here it is like that only

778
01:20:00,472 --> 01:20:04,515
You have made such a beautiful
house, But you never come down

779
01:20:04,973 --> 01:20:09,286
What can I do? My work requires
My attention 24 hours a day

780
01:20:10,737 --> 01:20:17,474
Good, The house is beautiful, But
were is the interior decorator?

781
01:20:17,661 --> 01:20:21,038

01:20:25,974 --> 01:20:31,377

Yes, I have planned to

787
01:20:40,228 --> 01:20:43,150
You are a doctor, You should
take Care of your health, …

788
01:20:43,307 --> 01:20:44,813
Or else how will you take
Care of you patients?

789
01:20:44,837 --> 01:20:46,957
And then your reputation is
such thatonce a patient…

790
01:20:46,992 --> 01:20:51,639
visits you, he never again
goes to any other doctor

791
01:20:52,020 --> 01:20:55,515
What do you mean? You mean to
Say, the patient who visits me…

792
01:20:55,805 --> 01:21:00,681

Not visit any other doctor

01:21:15,348 --> 01:21:19,083
Shall I spread it? -To Whom?
On the toast. -sure

799
01:21:21,054 --> 01:21:23,089
The house has been
Beautifully decorated

800
01:21:23,195 --> 01:21:27,067
I selected the interior decorator
-Brother-in-law, how about sugar?

801
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:30,130
Three spoons? -no, only one

802
01:21:30,501 --> 01:21:32,331
After forty, your sugar
intake Should be reduced

803
01:21:32,512 --> 01:21:37,076
How many times I have told you not
To mention my age in front of women

804
01:21:37,258 --> 01:21:40,194
What’s your programme today?
Going out or sitting at home?

805
01:21:40,314 --> 01:21:42,330
We will go out. I have not
came Here to sit at home

806
01:21:42,448 --> 01:21:44,823
Okay. we will come
in the evening -okay

807
01:22:14,253 --> 01:22:18,132
What are you looking at?
- Nothing

808
01:22:25,334 --> 01:22:27,964
You appear as if you
have seen a ghost

809
01:22:28,166 --> 01:22:30,354
No -yes

810
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:37,744
No. -What happened to you?
I was just a bit dizzy

811
01:22:37,995 --> 01:22:39,905
Let me take a look.

812
01:22:41,709 --> 01:22:44,032
They’re here. Should we
Call off the programme?

813
01:22:44,530 --> 01:22:49,160
I am okay. Lets go.
We are leaving

814
01:22:50,479 --> 01:22:55,688
You are going out? -Yes,
We are going out

815
01:22:55,931 --> 01:22:57,462
Good

816
01:22:58,128 --> 01:23:01,744
What are you saying? -Yes,
I have seen his ghost

817
01:23:02,745 --> 01:23:04,137
You saw him again? -Yes

818
01:23:04,308 --> 01:23:05,996
I saw him from the top floor

819
01:23:06,543 --> 01:23:09,066
When I came down,
He had disappeared

820
01:23:09,341 --> 01:23:12,379
It must be your imagination.
There are no ghosts

821
01:23:15,832 --> 01:23:17,660
What are you talking about?

822
01:23:18,643 --> 01:23:22,071
Nothing at all. -Uncle, she
is talking about ghosts

823
01:23:23,446 --> 01:23:27,617
Again? You have seen
a ghost here also?

824
01:23:28,952 --> 01:23:31,749
Tell me something, was the
ghost A male or female?

825
01:23:31,995 --> 01:23:37,796
Sunil, if the woman must be
beautiful, The ghost must be a man

826
01:23:38,348 --> 01:23:43,166
I see. Then the ghost doesn’t know
That she is a doctor Sunil’s wife

827
01:23:43,556 --> 01:23:48,369
If I see him, I will shoot him
With your third rate life

828
01:23:50,540 --> 01:23:54,172
Sunil you have scared me

829
01:23:54,768 --> 01:23:58,016
From now on I won’t be able
to joke with her

830
01:23:58,579 --> 01:24:01,286
You are a big boss. -Yes, I am

831
01:24:01,501 --> 01:24:05,710
Because the more jealous a man
Becomes, the more he loves his wife

832
01:24:07,250 --> 01:24:12,971
Now see, you are not jealous.
- I have other options

833
01:24:31,570 --> 01:24:37,171
What happened? Too much sugar? -you
haven’t added any sugar to it

834
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:51,713
Is doctor sunil at home?
Yes. -Who is it?

835
01:25:29,125 --> 01:25:30,055
Let's go driver

836
01:25:40,601 --> 01:25:45,727
Aarti, Why did the police come?
Did he ask you anything? -No

837
01:25:45,822 --> 01:25:47,244
Why did he take sunil along?

838
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:50,996
May be... -Where is that tourch

839
01:25:51,712 --> 01:25:54,696
Which tourch? -Same I had that day
Where is it? -With me

840
01:25:55,106 --> 01:25:57,558
What you doing here,

841
01:26:13,701 --> 01:26:17,061
Sister, it's not here -It's not there also,
let's see on 1st floor

842
01:26:39,042 --> 01:26:42,870
Sister can't find it, even I can't find it,
Where it could be?

843
01:26:43,902 --> 01:26:45,090
In the car?

844
01:26:58,078 --> 01:27:02,812
No sister -It's not here also,
Where it could be? may be there

845
01:27:05,283 --> 01:27:08,313
It's here, Must have fallan from
your hand -Sister

846
01:27:10,403 --> 01:27:12,528
How it can go down?

847
01:27:15,995 --> 01:27:20,402
If the corpse fell down from here,
it should be here -Than where is it?

848
01:27:20,621 --> 01:27:23,027
Than.. We shouldn't have come here

849
01:27:23,352 --> 01:27:24,993
Let’s go

850
01:27:42,878 --> 01:27:50,878
What will happen now?
What are you doing here?

851
01:27:51,897 --> 01:28:01,897
We came to see the Mahakali Temple.
Have you came here with a wish?

852
01:28:03,454 --> 01:28:06,080
Inspector, I will go with them.

853
01:28:12,841 --> 01:28:14,754
Why did you go tot the police station?

854
01:28:15,574 --> 01:28:17,965
To enquiry about a dead body
-Dead Body?

855
01:28:18,449 --> 01:28:22,229
Yes, yesterday when I was coming, I
came across a womens dead body

856
01:28:22,943 --> 01:28:28,139
I intimated the police. At first
I thought it was a accident,

857
01:28:28,741 --> 01:28:32,070
On investigation it was found out
That her husband was suspicious…

858
01:28:32,578 --> 01:28:36,360
About her, and so he killed her.
Since I intimated the police,

859
01:28:36,713 --> 01:28:39,855
They wanted my statement.
Lets go.

860
01:28:57,847 --> 01:29:01,440
Go on, Chaturvedi. Who, me?
No, I will be

861
01:29:02,214 --> 01:29:07,730
Staying here for 3-4 days.
Who? Mr.Biharilal?

862
01:29:09,073 --> 01:29:12,168
If he has problem with his sleep,
Give him some tranquilizer

863
01:29:12,645 --> 01:29:14,239
Yes, its okay. It’s
not a big problem,

864
01:29:15,314 --> 01:29:17,614
You take care of it.
It's not big problem

865
01:29:18,835 --> 01:29:24,718
No, I will be here for another
3-4 days. Anything else?

866
01:29:25,482 --> 01:29:27,185
No Problems, OK.

867
01:29:27,847 --> 01:29:29,997
If there is any urgency,
We will go back.

868
01:29:35,272 --> 01:29:37,722
What happened? -Why?

869
01:29:38,190 --> 01:29:44,352
Why? When I am there you always
Complain that I don’t give the company

870
01:29:44,633 --> 01:29:47,727
When I give the company,
You want me to go back

871
01:29:48,219 --> 01:29:52,407
I thought it was something very urgent.
- Its not urgent there, but here

872
01:29:53,970 --> 01:29:55,766
What’s so urgent here?

873
01:30:01,705 --> 01:30:03,947
It is urgent, isn’t it?

874
01:30:17,418 --> 01:30:18,700
Get in

875
01:30:24,316 --> 01:30:26,098
Sunil, please come soon

876
01:30:28,741 --> 01:30:31,312
What happened? -Look,
He is wounded.

877
01:30:31,691 --> 01:30:34,069
Sit down here. Rosy,
fetch some warm water

878
01:30:34,343 --> 01:30:35,740
Bring my bag. -OK sir

879
01:30:37,131 --> 01:30:41,556
Who is he? -Vinod, your
interior decorator.

880
01:30:41,666 --> 01:30:42,681
Yes, He is the man

881
01:30:43,313 --> 01:30:46,423
What happened to him? He’s
is the habit of drinking

882
01:30:46,523 --> 01:30:49,717
He might have been hit by some truck

883
01:31:00,240 --> 01:31:03,989
Doesn’t look like
An accident injury

884
01:31:04,267 --> 01:31:07,406
Didn’t you ask him?
- He wont say a word

885
01:31:11,063 --> 01:31:14,845
What? What are they saying?
How can it happen?

886
01:31:15,079 --> 01:31:17,751
I am speaking the truth.
He is sitting right there

887
01:31:18,039 --> 01:31:18,805
Inside? -Yes

888
01:31:18,999 --> 01:31:24,435
Let’s go and see. Doesn’t
-he have any relatives here?

889
01:31:25,362 --> 01:31:29,121
I don’t think so. He
never mentioned any

890
01:31:29,610 --> 01:31:35,222
Good Morning, What happened to him?
- Exactly what I suspected.

891
01:31:36,060 --> 01:31:40,173
What suspicion? -An
injury to the brain

892
01:31:40,704 --> 01:31:42,188
He has lost his memory

893
01:31:43,509 --> 01:31:47,684
Will he always be like this?
- It will take some time.

894
01:31:48,081 --> 01:31:50,426
Will he stay here until then?

895
01:31:50,765 --> 01:31:53,828
Where he will get the
Better doctor than Sunil?

896
01:31:54,112 --> 01:31:58,521
Bahadur… -Coming, Sir
Have you made the bed? -Yes Sir

897
01:31:58,938 --> 01:32:02,030
Take him inside.

898
01:32:05,258 --> 01:32:09,461
Aarti, that means,
We.. to live man

899
01:32:11,641 --> 01:32:14,875
It's good, at least
We are saved from sin

900
01:32:15,711 --> 01:32:18,586
Now it's better we forget
this incident

901
01:32:19,916 --> 01:32:24,571
Sister, I will tell everything to Sunil
-No No, Are you gone mad

902
01:32:24,955 --> 01:32:28,237
Don't you know Sunil?
If Sunil comes to know

903
01:32:28,425 --> 01:32:31,815
Vinod used to study with you and
used to love him

904
01:32:32,244 --> 01:32:35,775
But I did not like him -But how will
you make Sunil understand this

905
01:32:36,063 --> 01:32:38,880
He will misunderstand you
-But you know everything, Sister

906
01:32:39,156 --> 01:32:43,624
I know, God knows, But Sunil
doesn't know

907
01:32:44,961 --> 01:32:49,195
Blood stains may disappear, but
Doubt never fades

908
01:32:50,551 --> 01:32:54,926
If Sunil misunderstood you,
nobody will trust you

909
01:32:56,286 --> 01:33:00,458
And than, You will never be able to
proove yourself innocent

910
01:33:01,770 --> 01:33:08,286
Lest it happen, that your little mistake,
may ruin your family life

911
01:33:10,245 --> 01:33:14,152
Aarti, These secrets will remain
with us

912
01:33:14,444 --> 01:33:17,241
If Vinod said anything to Sunil?

913
01:33:17,726 --> 01:33:20,366
He has lots of misunderstaning
regarding me

914
01:33:21,795 --> 01:33:25,873
There is only one way, before he regain
his memory

915
01:33:26,444 --> 01:33:28,616
somehow he shuold be removed
from this house

916
01:33:31,930 --> 01:33:35,636
You are throwing your the best cards.
- I don’t need your help

917
01:33:36,972 --> 01:33:40,238
Okay, try this

918
01:33:40,706 --> 01:33:43,471
Doctor, I didn’t get a
single card till now

919
01:33:43,691 --> 01:33:46,792
I’ve got a full hand!

920
01:33:48,537 --> 01:33:49,792
Your turn, madam

921
01:33:50,702 --> 01:33:56,441
Come in -Me pack -Vinod come sit down
-You packed?

922
01:33:58,809 --> 01:34:01,521
You want to play? -you are
a strange man, major

923
01:34:01,881 --> 01:34:05,443
He has lost his memory,
-oh, I forgot

924
01:34:05,739 --> 01:34:10,505
But you had told me that he will
Regain his memory gradually

925
01:34:11,202 --> 01:34:15,484
In such cases patient tries
to Remember old memories

926
01:34:16,281 --> 01:34:20,610
Like school or college days
And then slowly he tries to

927
01:34:20,951 --> 01:34:22,640
Remember his recent past

928
01:34:22,944 --> 01:34:25,508
I think we should try to make
Him remember his old days

929
01:34:25,757 --> 01:34:28,210
Aarti can solve this problem
-How?

930
01:34:28,639 --> 01:34:32,543
They were college
mates, -Right, vidya?

931
01:34:33,646 --> 01:34:36,900
Yes. -Really? You never
told me about it

932
01:34:38,293 --> 01:34:40,764
I thought I told you

933
01:34:40,879 --> 01:34:43,734
Madam, the food is ready.
- Let me see

934
01:34:48,023 --> 01:34:51,086
Then I think it will
be easy for me.

935
01:35:10,787 --> 01:35:16,813
Aarti, Do you have another pen? The
refill In this pen has exhausted

936
01:35:31,325 --> 01:35:32,886
Put a refill in this

937
01:35:35,403 --> 01:35:38,941
What’s the matter?
- Will he stay here

938
01:35:39,673 --> 01:35:41,527
Who? -He

939
01:35:42,299 --> 01:35:43,926
Vinod? -Yes

940
01:35:45,622 --> 01:35:47,536
Yes. -Is it necessary?

941
01:35:48,095 --> 01:35:50,484
Why? He use to stay
Here even earlier

942
01:35:50,594 --> 01:35:51,634
But not in this condition

943
01:35:52,265 --> 01:35:54,733
Why don’t you admit him
to A government hospital?

944
01:35:55,782 --> 01:35:59,344
I see. So you know his
Condition better than me?

945
01:36:01,423 --> 01:36:05,100
He is not that serious to Be
admitted in the hospital

946
01:36:05,454 --> 01:36:09,485
Besides, I’m here too. Why…?
You have a problem with him?

947
01:36:10,364 --> 01:36:12,734
Why should I be worried?

948
01:36:18,278 --> 01:36:20,606
Mr. Sharma
-Don’t talk to me

949
01:36:20,809 --> 01:36:23,325
I am angry with you -Why?
What happened?

950
01:36:23,770 --> 01:36:26,067
You never met me
after coming here

951
01:36:26,801 --> 01:36:32,459
I came two days back. -Two days? I
met your wife here last Sunday

952
01:36:33,370 --> 01:36:35,778
She has been here for some time
-Has she come all alone?

953
01:36:36,111 --> 01:36:37,111

Man with her..forget it

"Nature has been kind to them”

1016
01:44:10,549 --> 01:44:14,425
“They have been taught not
To be loyal or love…”

1017
01:44:14,535 --> 01:44:17,476
“They have got everthing else”

1018
01:44:17,610 --> 01:44:24,286
“They have got everthing else”

1019
01:44:32,271 --> 01:44:38,928
“These pretty women are
true friends to no one”

1020
01:44:39,436 --> 01:44:45,332
“These pretty women are
true friends to no one”

1021
01:44:46,029 --> 01:44:53,936
“Even if they are friends,
They can never be loyal”

1022
01:44:54,572 --> 01:45:01,308
“These pretty women Are
true friends to no one”

1023
01:45:01,714 --> 01:45:07,398
“These pretty women are
true friends to no one”

1024
01:45:33,942 --> 01:45:37,160
“They are not to
blame, however..”

1025
01:45:37,365 --> 01:45:43,386
“what they do is so little”

1026
01:45:44,057 --> 01:45:53,539
“There’s someone they think about,
But get linked with someone else”

1027
01:45:54,101 --> 01:46:00,523
“Even when you think they’re
yours, They’re complete strangers”

1028
01:46:00,803 --> 01:46:06,860
“Even God couldn’t figure them
out, What is a mortal capable of?"

1029
01:46:07,243 --> 01:46:14,172
"What is a mortal capable of?"

1030
01:46:19,436 --> 01:46:26,000
“They’ll sway in stranger arms,
They will forget ties ages old”

1031
01:46:26,179 --> 01:46:29,125
"They will forget ties ages old”

1032
01:46:29,355 --> 01:46:35,708
“They keep changing their
minds Like the season change”

1033
01:46:36,123 --> 01:46:39,209
"Minds Like the season change”

1034
01:46:39,454 --> 01:46:42,578
“Their love is
always suspect…”

1035
01:46:42,843 --> 01:46:46,014
“they belong not
to anyone Forever”

1036
01:46:46,108 --> 01:46:52,585
“they belong not
to anyone Forever”

1037
01:46:52,845 --> 01:46:56,083
“They are as deceitful
As they are beautiful”

1038
01:46:56,243 --> 01:46:59,482
“to deceive is the profession
Of beautiful women”

1039
01:46:59,585 --> 01:47:05,970
“to deceive is the profession
Of beautiful women”

1040
01:47:14,649 --> 01:47:21,526
“These pretty women are
true friends to no one”

1041
01:47:21,823 --> 01:47:27,820
“These pretty women are
true friends to no one”

1042
01:47:28,300 --> 01:47:36,300

They can never be loyal”

1044
01:47:43,435 --> 01:47:49,296
“These pretty women are
true friends to no one”

1045
01:48:15,175 --> 01:48:24,227
Which flowers are that? What are
you looking at? -Your eyes

1046
01:48:26,390 --> 01:48:30,211
What do you see in them?
- What not?

1047
01:48:30,837 --> 01:48:32,184
Can I say something? -Go ahead

1048
01:48:32,924 --> 01:48:36,116
Will you keep it a secret? -Yes

1049
01:48:37,394 --> 01:48:42,586
Close your eyes when somebody
Comes in front of you. Why?

1050
01:48:43,749 --> 01:48:45,927
Seeing those eyes any one…
Will fall in love with you. Just

1051
01:48:45,990 --> 01:48:47,830
like I fell in love with you

1052
01:48:50,274 --> 01:48:55,924
My eyes have only your image

1053
01:49:25,133 --> 01:49:29,787
Try again -no..

1054
01:49:32,602 --> 01:49:39,477
Sir…
Sir.. -Buddy, you have won!

1055
01:49:40,791 --> 01:49:42,447
Good Morning
-God Morning

1056
01:49:43,499 --> 01:49:47,235
Dear, go have your breakfast
-Buddy, I will have my breakfast

1057
01:50:13,569 --> 01:50:17,588
Tell me something. Have
you ever been in love?

1058
01:50:19,549 --> 01:50:22,815
Love? -Yes, Love

1059
01:50:24,041 --> 01:50:28,197
No. -Try to recall
When you were kid?

1060
01:50:29,101 --> 01:50:32,190
No. -In school

1061
01:50:32,530 --> 01:50:35,877
No. -In college

1062
01:50:38,406 --> 01:50:39,766
Yes

1063
01:50:41,989 --> 01:50:46,552
What kind of girl was she? I mean
Was she fair or dark of skin?

1064
01:50:49,902 --> 01:50:51,662
Fair

1065
01:50:52,814 --> 01:50:55,768
Her hair? -was long

1066
01:50:58,058 --> 01:51:00,910
What was the thing in her
That had you captivated?

1067
01:51:02,799 --> 01:51:03,799
Her eyes

1068
01:51:42,751 --> 01:51:45,548
Shall I switch off the light?
- No..

1069
01:51:48,391 --> 01:51:52,226
Coming to bed? -You
sleep, I am sitting here

1070
01:52:06,638 --> 01:52:09,263
I told you, I wont be coming now

1071
01:53:56,899 --> 01:53:58,118
It’s dawn already?

1072
01:54:00,077 --> 01:54:02,450
You slept here?

1073
01:54:03,568 --> 01:54:05,133
Tell rosy to fetch some tea

1074
01:54:12,884 --> 01:54:15,252
Rosy, bring my lighter

1075
01:54:32,529 --> 01:54:33,623
Here you are

1076
01:54:37,311 --> 01:54:40,821
Listen, I have
something to tell you

1077
01:54:52,138 --> 01:54:57,527
Are you angry with me?
What’s the matter?

1078
01:54:59,570 --> 01:55:00,507
Don’t you know?

1079
01:55:03,974 --> 01:55:05,548
You are misunderstanding me

1080
01:55:09,072 --> 01:55:11,426
I used to misunderstand you

1081
01:55:17,651 --> 01:55:20,744
It’s not as you are thinking it is

1082
01:55:23,212 --> 01:55:27,756
What? What did you say?
It’s not as you are thinking it is

1083
01:55:29,371 --> 01:55:31,472
If you can’t diagnose the disease
by looking at the patient face…

1084
01:55:31,688 --> 01:55:33,620
Then you are not a doctor at all

1085
01:55:40,247 --> 01:55:41,669
-Won’t you listen to me?

1086
01:55:44,054 --> 01:55:45,649
What is left to listen to?

1087
01:55:48,053 --> 01:55:52,835
Yes, there is. There’s so
much I said until today?

1088
01:55:53,958 --> 01:55:57,083
I have only been listening
And enduring until now

1089
01:55:57,872 --> 01:56:04,259
You have no right to suspect
me without clarifying with me

1090
01:56:04,380 --> 01:56:09,693
Those who have no proof of the truth
Resort to raising there voices

1091
01:58:03,924 --> 01:58:09,183
Sister, I am going, Where?
Even I do not know

1092
01:58:09,763 --> 01:58:12,309
Sunil's suspicion has turned into hatred

1093
01:58:12,535 --> 01:58:16,472
And I do not have any evidence,
by which he can trust me

1094
01:58:17,199 --> 01:58:20,387
Only you know the truth

1095
01:58:20,706 --> 01:58:27,190
If husband does not have any respect for
his wife then she starts burdening him

1096
01:58:27,964 --> 01:58:30,699
If I stay here,
He will be sad to see me

1097
01:58:31,481 --> 01:58:35,420
I don't want this, I
wish he knew the truth,

1098
01:58:36,232 --> 01:58:38,170
So we don't get separated like this

1099
02:00:50,652 --> 02:00:53,568
No!

1100
02:01:04,768 --> 02:01:09,111
Doctor, I want to tell you something.
- I don’t want to hear anything

1101
02:02:07,995 --> 02:02:14,398
Aarti -You -Come with me

1102
02:02:15,014 --> 02:02:19,061
No -Come on -Where?
- Where you should go

1103
02:02:39,970 --> 02:02:42,043
You were going away,
Leaving me all alone?

1104
02:02:47,830 --> 02:02:50,665
Vinod told me.. -I came
to do the interiors here

1105
02:02:52,101 --> 02:02:54,529
But I created misunderstanding
Between the two of you

1106
02:02:55,396 --> 02:03:00,512
I can’t even apologise to you

1107
02:03:00,583 --> 02:03:04,738
For the mistake I have made

1108
02:03:06,623 --> 02:03:08,649
You can be a friend

1109
02:03:15,815 --> 02:03:18,518
I know that misunderstanding can

1110
02:03:18,586 --> 02:03:21,745
Cause a lot of problems. But
sometimes the problem itself

1111
02:03:22,076 --> 02:03:30,076
Can solve the misunderstanding. And
thus, I have realized my mistake

1112
02:03:31,810 --> 02:03:38,418
I have drifted far away from Aarti.
But now I am closer to

1113
02:03:38,710 --> 02:03:41,013
Her than ever before

1114
02:03:48,821 --> 02:03:51,212
I recognize every disease in the world

1115
02:03:52,040 --> 02:03:55,478
But you r mind, which is part of life

1116
02:03:56,540 --> 02:03:58,384
Couldn't recognize it

1117
02:04:00,196 --> 02:04:02,258
Please forgive...

1118
02:04:43,260 --> 02:04:47,931
The End…
