1
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,554
Hello?

2
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,076
No, he's not here.

3
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,876
I'm his mother.

4
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,078
Come over.

5
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,919
I'll be waiting.

6
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,871
We're back.

7
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,838
The girl's in the room by the hallway.

8
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,832
Thanks.

9
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,910
Am I eating alone?

10
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,556
I'm not sure she'll be coming down,
she's not well.

11
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,239
I'm sorry.

12
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,156
Giuseppe's not here?

13
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,228
You should talk to her.

14
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,635
She'll be better in the morning.

15
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,239
I'm packing my bags,
what should I bring?

16
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,829
Should I buy something for Easter,
a gift?

17
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,678
You celebrate it, right?

18
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:29,190
I'll bring your glasses,
the broken ones,

19
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,276
you left them at my place.

20
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,238
Oh, I have a bad surprise for you.

21
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,198
You'll hate me, but I bought
a guidebook.

22
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,874
To make up for it
I brought the red dress.

23
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,036
Is it too light?

24
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,475
Call me back before leave.

25
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,752
Where are you, Giuseppe?

26
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,474
I told your mom
I couldn't reach you

27
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,817
and that I arrive
by plane tomorrow.

28
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,109
She sounded odd...

29
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,037
I must've come across as an idiot.

30
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:12,173
Call me when you get this message,
I don' know what to do.

31
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,517
You don' want me
to come anymore?

32
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,317
Answer me, please.

33
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,675
I just got to your house.

34
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,354
You invited me, where
on earth are you?

35
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,995
Should I wait up or go to sleep?

36
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,479
I'll leave the door ajar,

37
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,458
wake me when you get here.

38
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,190
I want to make love to you.

39
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,718
I'll be waiting.

40
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,350
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

41
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,394
Are you feeling better
this morning, ma'am?

42
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,796
I'm Jeanne.

43
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,670
- Do we know each other?
- Aren't you Mrs. Remigi?

44
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,599
You must be looking
for my sister-in-law.

45
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:38,116
Sorry, I saw you here
and assumed you were her.

46
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,593
I came to give Anna a hand.

47
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,771
You've never met my sister-in-law?

48
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,957
I arrived last night
and she wasn't feeling well.

49
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,474
- You arrived last night?
- Yes, Pietro picked me up.

50
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,872
Jeanne...

51
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,038
Good morning.

52
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:06,196
I just made a fool of myself
with your sister-in-law.

53
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,515
Has Giuseppe arrived?

54
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,109
I'll bring the guests some coffee.

55
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,637
I'll help you.

56
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,434
Be right back, excuse me.

57
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,312
Who's she?

58
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,433
She came from Paris last night.

59
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,433
I'm waiting for
the right time to tell her.

60
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,390
Sorry about last night.

61
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,314
I wanted to be there
for your arrival but...

62
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,396
couldn't manage.

63
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,036
Did you sleep well?

64
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,791
Where's Giuseppe?

65
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,190
Why wasn't he here last night?

66
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,312
Why isn't he here now?
He knew I was coming.

67
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,240
We've suffered a terrible loss.

68
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,629
My brother died.

69
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,198
I'm sorry...

70
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,512
I didn't know.

71
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,435
It all happened so suddenly...

72
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,309
Is that why Giuseppe's not here?

73
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,469
I have to go back in,
they're waiting.

74
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,593
Sorry,

75
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,149
I've been mad at you
since yesterday.

76
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,075
This morning I even hated you.

77
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,193
Your mom told me what happened,
I'm sorry.

78
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,628
I don' know if you're listening
to my messages...

79
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,755
I wish you were here.

80
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,594
I had that dream
about water again,

81
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,069
but I was in a tall tower this time.

82
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,198
I wrote it down when I woke up.
You were in it too.

83
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,557
We had to climb a bunch of stairs
to reach the lake,

84
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,199
high up above.

85
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,830
Once up there it was really hot,

86
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,355
and I can' remember why

87
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,431
but I couldn't go in the water.

88
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,076
I want to sleep with you.

89
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,310
I want to sleep pristinely,

90
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,913
without dreams.

91
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,397
When are you coming?

92
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,471
What'll do here alone?

93
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,628
Pietro said I could help myself so...

94
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,910
You don't have to explain.

95
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:02,470
Sorry, I'll make you
something warm.

96
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,030
- No need, ma'am.
- Yes.

97
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,552
I'm wondering
if I've come at a bad time.

98
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,029
I wouldn't want to be
a burden to you.

99
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,996
No, you're not.

100
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:30,152
Maybe it's best if I come back
some other time.

101
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,632
Can you get the white wine
from the fridge?

102
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,356
And a glass.

103
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:03,192
- Is the wine for me?
- Yes.

104
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,150
Sorry, but I don't drink.

105
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,513
Ever?

106
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:16,918
Giuseppe made that same face
the first time we went out to eat.

107
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,874
How did you first meet?

108
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,072
At my house.

109
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,196
Ah, at your house.

110
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:41,195
I woke up and he was having
breakfast in my kitchen.

111
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,116
- You didn't know him?
- No.

112
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,510
But my roommate did.

113
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,636
But she'd left for work,

114
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,791
so he and I had breakfast together.

115
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,677
So you fought with your roommate
over him?

116
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,751
No, we still live together.

117
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,310
He wasn't dating her?

118
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,432
Not really, no.

119
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,910
Can I help you, ma'am?

120
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,638
- Eat up.
- Thanks.

121
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,478
It's good.

122
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,837
Stay here, Jeanne.

123
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,712
Will she stay tonight too?

124
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,309
She'll be needing clean towels.

125
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,958
There was hope that
Pope John Paul would be present.

126
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:25,032
It's the first time
in 26 years of papacy.

127
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,589
The Pope hasn't spoken...

128
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,234
Hello.

129
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,268
Hello.

130
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,598
Do you need anything?

131
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,432
To sleep.

132
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:05,239
I wanted to ask you something
without anyone else around...

133
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,517
I was thinking of buying flowers
for Mrs. Remigi,

134
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,310
but maybe it's inappropriate.

135
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,119
When was her brother's funeral?

136
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,674
No need to buy her flowers.

137
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,229
No need to do anything.

138
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,870
I'd like to go see the town.

139
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,590
Is there a bus?

140
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,675
There are no buses here.

141
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,652
- Morning.
- Good morning, ma'am.

142
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,073
You should've called me,
been up long?

143
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:10,357
I didn't want to bother you,
I wanted to go into town.

144
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,233
Into town?

145
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,879
It was just a thought...

146
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,510
There's not much to see.

147
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,040
With this heat,
it's best to walk around the grounds.

148
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,794
Let me show you around, come on.

149
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,195
Can I take a swim, ma'am?

150
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,597
The water must be cold.

151
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,236
You can call me Anna

152
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,311
if you'd like.

153
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,637
Do you want to come, Anna?

154
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,633
No.

155
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:54,468
I'm used to seeing
some parts of my body only in the dark.

156
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,556
Where are you?

157
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,517
Why won' you answer?

158
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,874
I haven' slept for two nights.

159
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,837
Your mom is odd.

160
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,794
Did you tell her about
last summer?

161
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,595
Is that why you're not answering?

162
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,835
I thought that was behind us.

163
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,833
I stopped calling when you said to,

164
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,389
I came back when you said to...

165
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,959
What must I do to make
you forgive me?

166
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,190
Your sister-in-law called.

167
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,076
You should call her back.

168
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,951
Is Jeanne back?

169
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,039
Yes.

170
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,150
Breathe slowly.

171
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,471
It's too hot.

172
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,834
But you have to stay for it to work.

173
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,558
Did you sleep last night?
You look tired.

174
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,470
I'm a light sleeper.

175
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:01,230
How are things with Giuseppe?

176
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,279
Fine.

177
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,556
Did he tell you about me?

178
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,756
Did you know I was coming?

179
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,279
Yes.

180
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,389
What did he tell you about us?

181
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,512
I'm his mother,
what do you think he'd tell me?

182
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,472
Lately he'd been... quiet.

183
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,836
You know how he can be.

184
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,477
He seemed sad.

185
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,395
Do you do that for every trip?

186
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:04,393
It's a method of mine,
so I don't get bored.

187
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,796
- Can I see?
- Yes.

188
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,356
I've never been able to.

189
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,993
You already knew Italian
when you came here?

190
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:31,271
Not as well as you.

191
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:36,872
I hitchhiked here without being able
to say a word to anyone.

192
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,954
My husband was the first
who spoke some French,

193
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:43,390
it was like a miracle for me.

194
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:46,154
- He gave you a ride too?
- Yes.

195
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:03,952
When...

196
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,155
when I met my husband's mother...

197
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:13,152
I didn't know how to behave.

198
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:14,548
You met her here?

199
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,953
Yes, they lived here then.

200
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:22,350
I didn't know...

201
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:26,354
how to present myself to her,
as a young and naive girl,

202
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:32,438
or as a self-assured woman.

203
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,158
What did you feel like?

204
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,676
Neither of the two...

205
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:43,432
I think I was eager for her to like me.

206
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:47,596
Like you.

207
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:34,234
The mosaic depicts
ten women in bikinis

208
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:37,756
putting on a show
in honour of the goddess Tethys.

209
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,356
Judging from their bodies,
we can deduce that beauty standards

210
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:43,676
were different than today.

211
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:48,038
In the first centuries, three
out of ten women died in childbirth.

212
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:51,875
Wide hips, hence the chance
of surviving childbirth,

213
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,996
were greatly valued
by men back then.

214
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:59,318
You thought Louis Réard
invented it?

215
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:00,515
Huh?

216
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:02,159
The bikini.

217
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,391
That's before your time.

218
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:21,357
Feeling better?

219
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,238
Yes, thanks.

220
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,595
Thanks to the Turkish bath,

221
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,593
one of the few good things
my husband left me.

222
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,193
You didn't see eye to eye?

223
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:32,918
We did, very much.

224
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:37,079
Even when it came
to getting divorced.

225
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:43,437
I was the first woman to divorce
in this part of Sicily.

226
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:45,352
- Did you know that?
- Yes.

227
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,792
Giuseppe told me.

228
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:52,317
He even told me
about his grandmother's divorce.

229
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,636
When my mother-in-law realised

230
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,155
that God didn't strike me dead
after the divorce,

231
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:02,958
she wanted to do the same.

232
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:07,351
She began saying:
"I want to live my own life!"

233
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,750
What did she do after divorcing?

234
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,639
Nothing, she went
to live with her son.

235
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:25,675
One day I had
an overwhelming feeling

236
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,595
that it was over between me
and him.

237
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:32,353
I saw him from afar with his lover,

238
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:35,114
a co- worker who was half his age.

239
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:40,312
He was smoking and gesticulating,
being funny,

240
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,072
and she looked at him...

241
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:45,956
And laughed, hung
on his every word.

242
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:51,871
There was a veneration in her eyes
that I would never again feel.

243
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:53,959
Never again.

244
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:59,035
Were you disappointed?

245
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:01,151
No, I knew he had a lover,

246
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:02,992
I wasn't jealous.

247
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:06,950
Feeling jealousy means
you still desire someone, right?

248
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,118
Are you jealous?

249
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,554
Very.

250
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,910
And Giuseppe...

251
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,718
is he jealous?

252
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,473
Yes.

253
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:33,995
I was jealous...

254
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:39,115
of my husband when I still
wanted to make love to him.

255
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,788
We tried to pretend for many years,

256
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,030
but couldn't manage.

257
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:54,873
- Do you mind me telling you this?
- No, why would I?

258
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,478
I don't know...

259
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,631
because I'm your boyfriend's mother.

260
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,756
You must be thinking...

261
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:07,273
"Now what should I say to her?

262
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:10,677
Maybe this, maybe not that..."

263
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,874
When Giuseppe invited me
to come here

264
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:24,908
we hadn't spoken
to each other in weeks.

265
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,511
He surprised me.

266
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,877
Our relationship was dissolving,

267
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,190
that's why he was sad.

268
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:50,956
- Rosa called again this morning.
- We argued, I won't speak to her.

269
00:51:58,280 --> 00:51:59,315
Morning.

270
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:02,472
Good morning. Did you sleep well?

271
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:05,438
Come in, breakfast is ready.

272
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,789
Since I didn't welcome you properly,

273
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:13,916
I'd like to prepare something.

274
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:15,911
- No need.
- I want to.

275
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:20,519
- Can I help?
- No, Pietro will.

276
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,716
It will all be ready for you.

277
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:27,275
Can you buy those things
I wrote down, please?

278
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:32,315
I'm off, so I don't ruin the surprise.

279
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:36,954
Excuse me...

280
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:41,589
if you want to see the town
come with me, I'm going shopping.

281
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,993
Thanks,
but we got back late last night.

282
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:48,153
Unless you need help,
I'll just stay here.

283
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:00,079
How do you say "papillon"?

284
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,515
Papillon...

285
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:05,155
Butterfly.

286
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:12,519
- You stopped competing?
- Six years ago.

287
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:15,351
Why?

288
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:18,918
Too many rules,
too many impositions.

289
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:28,715
- What brings you to Sicily?
- I'm waiting for my boyfriend.

290
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,874
You wait all day at the lake for him?

291
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,996
I'm staying with his mother.

292
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:40,079
We talk on the phone
but he has things to do.

293
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,791
He'll be back for Easter.

294
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,475
He'll be here for the holiday.

295
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,350
Let me see it.

296
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:01,192
What?

297
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:56,156
How long have you known
each other?

298
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:58,709
Well, more or less forever.

299
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:03,033
But if I hadn't told him,
he'd still think I was shy with girls.

300
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:05,754
No way,
I knew he was gay right away!

301
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:08,354
Don't say that or he'll kill you!

302
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:11,318
I was concerned at first,

303
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:14,233
I'd pick up girls
just to introduce them to him.

304
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:17,039
- You sacrificed yourself.
- He sacrificed himself...

305
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:22,872
- Do you have a boyfriend?
- From Monday through Friday.

306
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:24,917
That's his mantra.

307
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:29,032
- Is it true or just for show?
- Just for show.

308
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,197
- This pasta is divine.
- Thanks.

309
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:36,909
- It's easy to make.
- Why is it dark?

310
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:40,000
I used some carob flour.

311
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:43,311
- We saw a valley of carobs.
- What are they?

312
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:45,710
They're gorgeous trees.

313
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:49,519
They produce brown fruit,

314
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:52,635
they dry on the branch
instead of falling off.

315
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:56,433
Jeanne...

316
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:09,112
Drinking?

317
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,552
Just a bit.

318
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:19,949
To the girl who's become a woman.

319
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:24,075
What are you two secretly saying?

320
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:29,832
When Jeanne got here, she was
like a little girl on a field trip,

321
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,911
shy...

322
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:33,713
polite...

323
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:37,389
but here we are with two strangers!

324
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:45,880
You're no longer a little girl
who doesn't drink!

325
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:47,951
Sometimes I forget!

326
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:53,555
They didn't seem dangerous.

327
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:57,272
- He's a bit dangerous.
- I'm not dangerous.

328
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:05,070
Pietro, Anna made
some delicious food.

329
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:07,038
Good evening.

330
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:11,838
- Come sit.
- No, thanks.

331
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:13,877
I'm tired.

332
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,716
May I speak to you, ma'am?

333
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:22,275
Yes. Be right back.

334
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:27,275
Put on some music if you'd like.

335
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:42,479
Why are you doing this to her?

336
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:49,274
We're dining with two guests.

337
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:53,033
What's wrong with that?

338
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:56,078
What'll you tell her tomorrow
when Giuseppe doesn't return?

339
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:04,436
Tell her the truth.

340
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:06,910
Let her leave.

341
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:13,599
If you don't want to help with dinner,
you can go.

342
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:34,394
Good morning.

343
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:41,192
What are you doing?

344
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:45,475
Preparing for tomorrow.

345
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:47,399
Can I help you?

346
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:49,516
No need to, thanks.

347
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:58,309
I saw Pietro leaving.

348
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:02,188
Yes, tomorrow's a holiday for him too.

349
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:16,714
What time is Giuseppe coming?

350
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:21,158
I don't know.

351
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:25,674
You told me he'd arrive today.

352
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:35,311
We were just dancing.

353
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:37,348
What?

354
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:40,350
I saw how you looked at me.

355
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:43,430
How did I look at you?

356
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:48,188
As if I was doing something wrong,

357
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:51,115
but there wasn't anything wrong.

358
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:57,951
Sit down, Jeanne.

359
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:37,553
I'm sorry, I should've told you
sooner but...

360
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:45,518
I wasn't able to.

361
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:52,029
Giuseppe won't be coming back.

362
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:54,911
What do you mean?

363
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:06,038
He doesn't want to see you.

364
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:11,071
He didn't know how to tell you.

365
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,070
How do you know?

366
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,116
It's because of last summer.

367
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:24,633
I didn't tell you anything
about last summer.

368
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:27,229
But Giuseppe told me.

369
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,389
Last night when I saw you dancing...

370
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:35,916
I wasn't upset with you.

371
01:10:37,420 --> 01:10:39,192
You could've fallen for that guy.

372
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:40,713
But nothing happened.

373
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:42,791
I love Giuseppe.

374
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:45,993
I know.

375
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:49,118
Nothing happened
because you're waiting for him.

376
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:54,512
But Giuseppe won't be coming back,
just forget him.

377
01:10:55,420 --> 01:10:56,650
That's not fair.

378
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:58,711
You're right, it's not.

379
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:05,354
But you'll get over him
and will forget him.

380
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,716
I can't forget him.

381
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:12,396
It will happen, Jeanne.

382
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:15,312
You're young, you'll forget

383
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:17,152
and fall in love again.

384
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:19,880
It could've happened last night,
and that's fine.

385
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:23,990
I can't live without him.

386
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:50,271
You will live,

387
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:51,953
period.

388
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:56,040
You will because
that's what everyone does.

389
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:01,749
And Giuseppe will do it too.

390
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,594
Maybe he'll have a family and kids...

391
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:11,790
he'll fall in love
with another woman

392
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:15,715
that you won't meet,
maybe I won't either,

393
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:17,108
but he'll live,

394
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:19,157
far from you and your life.

395
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:24,991
That's that, Jeanne.

396
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:30,717
Let him go.

397
01:12:57,680 --> 01:12:59,557
You can't do this to me.

398
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:01,793
I hate you.

399
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:03,513
I hate you!

400
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:06,919
You should've told me,
not your mother!

401
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:09,710
I came here for you.

402
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:11,553
I hate you.

403
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:16,310
Why'd you just disappear?

404
01:13:58,240 --> 01:13:59,958
I knew it.

405
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:07,996
I knew he wouldn't forgive me.

406
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:13,110
I should never have come here.

407
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:19,232
Well I'm glad you came.

408
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:32,833
There are festivities in town tonight,

409
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,672
want to go with me?

410
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:37,274
Thanks, but I'd rather stay here.

411
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:42,678
I need to pack, my flight's
in the morning.

412
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:05,918
I thought you would miss
the festivities.

413
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:40,272
Get out, it's late.

414
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:42,510
I just got in.

415
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:58,471
Let me see your hands.

416
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:05,760
Are you going to punish me now?

417
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:07,952
Yes.

418
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:22,439
When you were small,
one day you said

419
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:27,274
that you would marry me
when you grew up.

420
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:31,997
So I explained that
I was already married to your father

421
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:35,516
and you said:
"Then I'll get married alone".

422
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:47,190
I don't want you to be alone.

423
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:56,557
You could've thought of that
before moving far away.

424
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:09,793
Why don't you stay
a few more days?

425
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:14,636
I can't.

426
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:31,595
We didn't have enough time together.

427
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:38,837
I miss you.

428
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:52,471
Will you talk to her?

429
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:04,952
When I imagine you away,
I prefer picturing you with her than alone.

430
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:09,996
You imagine my life?

431
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:18,669
I can't help myself.

432
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:48,392
Where are you?

433
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:50,798
Why won' you answer?

434
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:55,077
Your mom is odd.

435
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:58,113
Did you tell her about
last summer?

436
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:02,075
What must I do to make you
forgive me?

437
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:14,590
I had that dream
about water again,

438
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:17,672
but I was in a tall tower this time.

439
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:20,638
I wrote it down when I woke up.
You were in it too.

440
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:24,718
We had to climb a bunch of stairs
to reach the lake,

441
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:26,393
high up above.

442
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:30,389
Once up there it was really hot,

443
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:33,472
and I can' remember why
but I couldn't go in the water.

444
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:39,951
I want to sleep with you.

445
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:43,112
I want to sleep pristinely,
without dreams.

446
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:47,511
When are you coming?

447
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:51,030
What'll do here alone?

448
01:22:56,440 --> 01:22:58,351
Answer me, please.

449
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:00,756
I just got to your house.

450
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:03,714
You invited me, where
on earth are you?

451
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:08,395
I'll leave the door ajar.

452
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:11,149
I want to make love to you.

453
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:36,834
I'm packing my bags,
what should I bring?

454
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,673
Should I buy something for Easter,
a gift?

455
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:41,592
You celebrate it, right?

456
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:45,755
I'll bring your glasses,
the broken ones,

457
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:47,797
you left them at my place.

458
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:51,155
I brought the red dress
that you like.

459
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:53,356
Is it too light?

460
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:05,078
Call me back before leave.

461
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:37,668
Where are you, Giuseppe?

462
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:39,992
It's mum.

463
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:42,833
Why aren't you answering?

464
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,355
Where are you?

465
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:49,439
It's pouring out
and it's almost dawn...

466
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:51,997
Has something happened?

467
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:53,912
Answer me, please.

468
01:24:55,200 --> 01:24:56,872
Where are you?

469
01:30:04,040 --> 01:30:05,871
Have you packed everything?

470
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,639
This house will be empty now.

471
01:32:22,920 --> 01:32:24,876
THE WAIT
