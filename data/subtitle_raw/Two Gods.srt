1
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,863
- Yo.
- Salam alaikum, bruh.

2
00:00:43,137 --> 00:00:45,137
Did Sr. Khadija call
you, Lil Sis just call you?

3
00:00:46,227 --> 00:00:47,176
No she didn't
call me, why what's up?

4
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,355
She gonna call you
'cause somebody just died,

5
00:00:50,379 --> 00:00:53,335
just now in the emergency room and
they want them in a box like right now

6
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:55,932
whoever it is, they want
them in a box right now.

7
00:00:57,366 --> 00:01:00,102
They want 'em in a box right now?

8
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:02,235
Yeah, she just died
in the emergency room.

9
00:01:02,259 --> 00:01:04,100
Where she at?

10
00:01:04,124 --> 00:01:05,924
She had to go to the funeral home.

11
00:01:06,974 --> 00:01:08,076
She said drive her up,

12
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,472
bring her to the funeral home.

13
00:01:09,496 --> 00:01:14,825
So you come to me real fast, help
me put this shipper on. We got the truck.

14
00:01:16,408 --> 00:01:17,408
Okay.

15
00:01:33,241 --> 00:01:36,622
That's right, man I wasn't
totally sure, what's going on.

16
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,964
This is amazing to me,

17
00:04:34,988 --> 00:04:37,821
this is something, like a love right here.

18
00:04:38,796 --> 00:04:43,796
It's what I'm supposed to be doing.
And I always keep it focused on the work.

19
00:04:44,108 --> 00:04:45,444
You know what I mean?

20
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:04,925
You may not understand
but I put dedication

21
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:07,082
and pride to what I do, I really do.

22
00:05:08,249 --> 00:05:10,576
And I take life serious,

23
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,320
'cause this ain't no
damn game by no means.

24
00:05:13,794 --> 00:05:18,185
♪ Girlfriend yes I had your girlfriend ♪

25
00:05:18,209 --> 00:05:20,209
You don't know nothing about that.

26
00:05:20,233 --> 00:05:22,379
♪ That was your love 'cause
she was a last life ♪

27
00:05:22,403 --> 00:05:27,403
♪ Girlfriend, girlfriend
yes I had your girlfriend ♪

28
00:05:29,343 --> 00:05:31,510
Yeah, yeah.

29
00:05:43,911 --> 00:05:46,732
I used to go with Rashad
to deliver caskets.

30
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:51,266
So one day, Rashad said to me,

31
00:05:52,578 --> 00:05:55,635
'Now I can be paying you,
you can do this here,

32
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:57,242
it ain't that hard.'

33
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,213
And ever since then,

34
00:05:59,237 --> 00:06:02,183
I've been building these caskets.

35
00:06:02,207 --> 00:06:04,176
No I'm not worried about that.

36
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:08,117
Yeah I need to know where
to cut the other one.

37
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:12,251
Don't worry about one just do one,

38
00:06:12,275 --> 00:06:15,108
you can do the other one tomorrow.

39
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:40,522
I'm 12. More responsibilities in life now.
I turn a little bit older.

40
00:06:41,631 --> 00:06:44,882
Come on, you gonna sing happy birthday?

41
00:06:46,849 --> 00:06:51,195
Happy birthday dear Furquan,

42
00:06:51,219 --> 00:06:55,332
Happy birthday to you.

43
00:07:00,405 --> 00:07:01,572
Alright now,

44
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,495
that's too much cake though,

45
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:10,869
this cake not going nowhere.

46
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:15,772
Whatcha got, double layers?

47
00:07:18,589 --> 00:07:19,689
This is my bathroom.

48
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:23,152
I got a pull in shower, pull out shower.

49
00:07:28,429 --> 00:07:29,429
This my room.

50
00:07:33,126 --> 00:07:35,145
Me and my brother share a room,

51
00:07:35,169 --> 00:07:38,286
my mom and her boyfriend share a room.

52
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:42,659
This is my mom's, Trouble go sit down.

53
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:50,322
I just want a good birthday, that's all.

54
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:52,789
Go man, about to get you.

55
00:07:57,689 --> 00:07:59,082
So hot out here, they sweating.

56
00:08:01,741 --> 00:08:03,908
Let's go Hanif.

57
00:08:29,115 --> 00:08:34,032
Be good lil bruh, you heard me?

58
00:08:35,365 --> 00:08:39,532
Hey! Hanif!

59
00:08:53,019 --> 00:08:55,724
Grab this, pour the
bottle as you're walking

60
00:08:55,748 --> 00:09:00,448
round the back, man!

61
00:09:02,302 --> 00:09:03,422
He all right.

62
00:09:04,409 --> 00:09:06,765
He think he's my only uncle but he not.

63
00:09:06,789 --> 00:09:11,402
There's two more, He's the baby, boy.

64
00:09:14,589 --> 00:09:15,855
I used to work nights,

65
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:17,875
and he used to babysit my kids.

66
00:09:17,899 --> 00:09:21,275
I get in the house, every light is on.

67
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:24,105
I'm calling and calling and
my kids answer the phone,

68
00:09:24,129 --> 00:09:25,375
I'm like where's Uncle Hanif?

69
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,395
He right here on the couch.

70
00:09:26,419 --> 00:09:28,465
What do you mean? Sleep.

71
00:09:28,489 --> 00:09:31,965
Uncle Hanif, the kids up they
supposed to be in bed for school.

72
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:34,495
Do not ever let him babysit for you.

73
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:37,205
No babysitting and that is on record.

74
00:09:37,229 --> 00:09:38,677
Don't babysit.

75
00:09:38,701 --> 00:09:41,564
I had to come here,
then she fussed at me.

76
00:09:41,588 --> 00:09:42,745
I'm the niece.

77
00:09:42,769 --> 00:09:43,579
Yeah, I let them see

78
00:09:43,603 --> 00:09:47,285
I'm not the mamma, I'm the niece, okay?

79
00:09:47,309 --> 00:09:48,820
You listen to me.

80
00:09:50,599 --> 00:09:55,135
When he was younger he was,
still on the wrong path.

81
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:56,106
You know what I mean?

82
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:58,715
Through Uncle Hanif's
experiences, his bad stuff,

83
00:09:58,739 --> 00:10:01,685
his rough time, I let him
be an example to my kids

84
00:10:01,709 --> 00:10:05,645
because you could come out
of that, if you choose to.

85
00:10:05,669 --> 00:10:08,065
But what Uncle Hanif,
even though I fuss at him

86
00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:10,865
like he my son, and God or Allah,

87
00:10:10,889 --> 00:10:13,915
whatever his caller is High Above,

88
00:10:13,939 --> 00:10:18,555
has helped him really
recognize what he has,

89
00:10:18,579 --> 00:10:20,992
what he lost, and what he can do.

90
00:10:29,108 --> 00:10:32,988
I will, I must stop the violence.

91
00:10:33,012 --> 00:10:34,755
Beloved brothers and sisters,

92
00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:37,875
you know it's gotta be bad
when a mortician come out,

93
00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:39,422
and tell you to stop killing.

94
00:10:40,299 --> 00:10:43,705
We tired of patching up bullet wounds,

95
00:10:43,729 --> 00:10:46,882
we tired up putting your
skull back together.

96
00:10:50,369 --> 00:10:51,369
I'm on my way.

97
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:52,235
Alright.

98
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:57,073
I did four also. I'll
be there in a minute.

99
00:10:59,969 --> 00:11:02,755
We have an obligation, as Muslims,

100
00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:05,215
to change things with our hands.

101
00:11:05,239 --> 00:11:08,525
We have a condition here
and now of our people,

102
00:11:08,549 --> 00:11:10,605
Waiting to exhale.

103
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:12,255
To exhale from what?

104
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:16,162
From burying our children,
because of the streets.

105
00:11:20,645 --> 00:11:24,184
I played the streets man, getting high

106
00:11:24,859 --> 00:11:28,682
playing with the gun
just trying to survive.

107
00:11:30,179 --> 00:11:33,032
So as years went by, I
started going to prison.

108
00:11:34,419 --> 00:11:39,175
I caught myself up, I'm not
gonna never blame nobody,

109
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,532
for the shit that I did.

110
00:11:42,721 --> 00:11:45,562
That's when I realized
it was time for a change.

111
00:12:00,781 --> 00:12:04,797
I met Hanif through,
he taught me how to build

112
00:12:04,821 --> 00:12:07,605
caskets that they bury Muslims in.

113
00:12:07,629 --> 00:12:09,065
He taught me a lot of stuff.

114
00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:10,289
I wanna experience it.

115
00:12:11,252 --> 00:12:13,415
It's not as easy as it look,

116
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:16,629
but he want me to wash
the bodies with him.

117
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:18,952
I'm a little scared of dead people,

118
00:12:20,597 --> 00:12:22,875
I don't really like that stuff.

119
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:24,982
I'm still like a big ol' kid.

120
00:12:32,806 --> 00:12:35,006
This for you right here
Naz, this for you right here.

121
00:12:39,469 --> 00:12:43,905
When I first met Hanif,
it was like an older, older brother

122
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,572
that I don't have
'cause I'm the only child.

123
00:12:47,629 --> 00:12:49,445
And you know you can call me anytime,

124
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:51,002
like I'm flipping running but,

125
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:52,851
I just don't want you,

126
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:54,542
to get caught up in that extra shit man.

127
00:12:56,869 --> 00:13:00,675
I just don't want you to
get caught up in that.

128
00:13:00,699 --> 00:13:05,699
He took me to plenty masjids,
meet new people.

129
00:13:06,139 --> 00:13:08,542
I think it was the second day of Ramadan.

130
00:13:10,179 --> 00:13:11,745
So if it wasn't for him,

131
00:13:11,769 --> 00:13:14,085
I probably wouldn't know
as many Muslim brothers,

132
00:13:14,109 --> 00:13:15,655
that I know now.

133
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:18,125
He started off from where I started from,

134
00:13:18,149 --> 00:13:21,955
and it feel good
'cause no matter what I go through,

135
00:13:21,979 --> 00:13:25,302
I know that if I call
Hanif, I know he gonna come,

136
00:13:25,326 --> 00:13:26,862
I know he always there for me.

137
00:13:46,169 --> 00:13:48,336
- Salam Alaikum.
- Walaikum asalams.

138
00:13:57,189 --> 00:13:59,595
You put your your
thumbs in here, like this,

139
00:13:59,619 --> 00:14:02,255
and the other one, and
then you put your gloves,

140
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:06,086
so that the water and everything.
But you should tape your sweater.

141
00:14:09,153 --> 00:14:12,245
Hanif, you already cleaned him off?

142
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:14,159
No.

143
00:14:29,144 --> 00:14:32,272
While your washing,
all you doing is raise him, here,

144
00:14:32,296 --> 00:14:35,335
so you just use your
left hand in those areas.

145
00:14:35,359 --> 00:14:38,235
So we gonna hold him out like this here,

146
00:14:38,259 --> 00:14:39,839
and then we'll wash correct.

147
00:14:54,359 --> 00:14:56,122
Second time I did a washing,

148
00:14:58,490 --> 00:14:59,690
it was a friend of mine.

149
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:04,865
It was an honour and
opportunity being able to,

150
00:15:04,889 --> 00:15:08,232
help the ones that got called home,

151
00:15:09,379 --> 00:15:11,309
and knowing my time was coming.

152
00:15:14,189 --> 00:15:16,889
Rashad pretty much put me under his wing.

153
00:15:19,859 --> 00:15:23,625
What's important
is, you give them their right,

154
00:15:23,649 --> 00:15:26,952
which is wash them, properly.

155
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:31,115
And while you're taking pride,

156
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:32,735
into doing what you're doing,

157
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:36,245
because they're no longer
able to do it for themselves,

158
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,485
you're receiving the benefit

159
00:15:38,509 --> 00:15:40,992
and the mercy from your Creator.

160
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:47,172
The benefit and the
blessing that comes from it,

161
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,022
Who doesn't need 40 major sins removed?

162
00:15:52,949 --> 00:15:56,572
Who doesn't need, all your sins removed?

163
00:16:03,469 --> 00:16:06,295
What you learned today is what happens,

164
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:08,786
to a Muslim after they die.

165
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,555
In case I was to get killed,

166
00:16:12,579 --> 00:16:14,592
or I was to die of natural causes,

167
00:16:15,609 --> 00:16:17,525
what you supposed to do to me?

168
00:16:17,549 --> 00:16:20,565
Wash my right side, wash my left side,

169
00:16:20,589 --> 00:16:26,152
clean me up, shroud me, right? Right?

170
00:16:27,979 --> 00:16:28,979
Yes.

171
00:16:48,599 --> 00:16:52,452
Take me on this doggone
bike, they ain't gonna see me.

172
00:16:52,476 --> 00:16:54,393
Ain't gonna see what?

173
00:16:55,533 --> 00:16:57,224
Don't go that way yo.

174
00:16:57,248 --> 00:16:59,564
Bruh bruh, I'm trying to turn around.

175
00:16:59,588 --> 00:17:01,812
Yeah but still don't go that way.

176
00:17:01,836 --> 00:17:06,836
See, he told me to turn, he did.

177
00:17:11,183 --> 00:17:14,549
Woo baby baby! I got this thing here.

178
00:17:17,052 --> 00:17:18,376
Don't go that way.

179
00:17:19,528 --> 00:17:20,617
Come on, today's my day off.

180
00:17:20,641 --> 00:17:22,144
Okay, let me see what you working with.

181
00:17:22,168 --> 00:17:24,501
Today's my day off, bruh.

182
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,965
Today my day off I'm all by myself.

183
00:17:29,989 --> 00:17:30,989
You is?
My mom...

184
00:17:31,703 --> 00:17:32,651
You ain't by yourself then,

185
00:17:32,675 --> 00:17:33,718
You with us.

186
00:17:33,742 --> 00:17:36,614
My mom, stepfather and my brother
went to a party.

187
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:38,198
Oh for real?
Yeah and I didn't wanna go.

188
00:17:38,305 --> 00:17:39,409
And you didn't
wanna go. Why is that?

189
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:40,343
It was a kiddie party.

190
00:17:40,367 --> 00:17:41,646
I'm not about to go to no kiddie party.

191
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:42,887
You a kid.

192
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,721
I ain't a kid.

193
00:17:43,745 --> 00:17:44,994
I'm a grown man.

194
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:49,585
So you wouldn't help me
if I needed your help?

195
00:17:49,609 --> 00:17:50,418
Yeah.

196
00:17:50,442 --> 00:17:51,442
I need your help.

197
00:17:53,014 --> 00:17:56,286
You gonna need brakes to
do a wheelie on this one.

198
00:17:59,433 --> 00:18:01,025
Jump right at it, be careful.

199
00:18:01,049 --> 00:18:02,766
You gotta make sure
that it's lined up right.

200
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:07,566
This not a gun that you
use to hurt people with, okay?

201
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:10,145
So just be careful on how you doing it.

202
00:18:10,169 --> 00:18:11,652
Hold that don't shoot it.

203
00:18:13,486 --> 00:18:14,995
You want to make sure
it's even just like this,

204
00:18:15,019 --> 00:18:17,895
now shoot. Push it out, take it out,

205
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,155
take it off the board now put
it back down and shoot it,

206
00:18:20,179 --> 00:18:21,179
make sure it's even.

207
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:24,505
You can hold this board.

208
00:18:24,529 --> 00:18:27,165
Now look over there and see
if anything come out.

209
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:30,262
No, like this all right?

210
00:18:31,334 --> 00:18:32,494
Yeah, take that off.

211
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:35,785
You tell your
friends on what you do?

212
00:18:35,809 --> 00:18:36,883
No.

213
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:37,491
Or what you help doing.

214
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,036
You think that would be a good
experience for them to learn?

215
00:18:43,659 --> 00:18:44,912
Yeah, maybe.

216
00:18:46,239 --> 00:18:47,639
What friends
are you hanging around?

217
00:18:48,589 --> 00:18:51,795
I really hang around
basically my cousins.

218
00:18:51,819 --> 00:18:54,569
Girls. You be around girls?

219
00:18:56,539 --> 00:18:57,575
That's not a good answer.

220
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:59,647
So when I saw you, who you was with?

221
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:00,801
Where?

222
00:19:00,825 --> 00:19:02,764
At the park.

223
00:19:02,788 --> 00:19:03,871
Oh. A girl.

224
00:19:06,469 --> 00:19:07,719
So you be around girls?

225
00:19:09,123 --> 00:19:10,979
Sometimes.

226
00:19:14,089 --> 00:19:15,311
Wanna try this?

227
00:19:15,335 --> 00:19:16,335
Yeah.
Right there?

228
00:19:17,081 --> 00:19:17,891
Right there,

229
00:19:17,915 --> 00:19:20,446
push your weight use
your back arm and push.

230
00:19:22,373 --> 00:19:24,873
Don't let it lean up off you.

231
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:29,232
Push, push, push, push, push good job.

232
00:19:47,237 --> 00:19:49,448
Let me see how you get up there.

233
00:19:49,472 --> 00:19:52,889
Hold this for me Furquan,
give me this concrete.

234
00:19:54,978 --> 00:19:56,098
What this?

235
00:19:56,122 --> 00:19:58,752
Furquan actually
is a very strong kid.

236
00:19:59,617 --> 00:20:00,675
But when you live in that neighbourhood

237
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,475
and you grow up in that neighbourhood,

238
00:20:02,499 --> 00:20:05,735
he's like a speck in a
mountain full of snow.

239
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,646
You know what I'm saying?

240
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:08,925
He sticks out like a sore thumb.

241
00:20:08,949 --> 00:20:11,045
And him not having a father image,

242
00:20:11,069 --> 00:20:14,275
somebody to take him to
play ball or to go fishing.

243
00:20:14,299 --> 00:20:17,075
He's never had anybody.

244
00:20:17,099 --> 00:20:19,306
You got lucky, you just
owe me a slice of pizza.

245
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:20,556
You got money?

246
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:21,940
You got the money.
I have no money.

247
00:20:22,408 --> 00:20:23,408
Catch.

248
00:20:29,712 --> 00:20:33,415
I like him, he could be a good kid.

249
00:20:33,439 --> 00:20:34,882
He just need guidance.

250
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,250
He don't need the quality
time on the street.

251
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:52,896
If I die what would you do?
What would you do if I died?

252
00:20:53,931 --> 00:20:55,264
I'd bury you.

253
00:20:57,263 --> 00:20:59,572
I appreciate that.

254
00:20:59,596 --> 00:21:01,446
And then I take your business over,

255
00:21:02,379 --> 00:21:03,893
then I'll be building caskets.

256
00:21:05,485 --> 00:21:06,885
And take over all of this.

257
00:21:14,409 --> 00:21:15,441
Hey.

258
00:21:18,053 --> 00:21:20,453
I didn't know he look like me,
everyone say he look like me.

259
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:22,238
Does he look like me?

260
00:21:24,401 --> 00:21:27,765
Y'all tell him put
the gloves on. Yeah, yeah.

261
00:21:27,789 --> 00:21:29,526
If I hurt my son, man.

262
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,107
Put the gloves on.

263
00:21:32,081 --> 00:21:34,706
You really think you can
handle your dad though?

264
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:36,480
That's crazy my dude.

265
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:39,341
You really think you can handle that?

266
00:21:39,365 --> 00:21:40,827
I'll get 'em if you think you can handle.

267
00:21:40,851 --> 00:21:42,977
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

268
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:45,418
Get the gloves, go on.

269
00:21:53,059 --> 00:21:56,672
When I was
locked up I left my son.

270
00:21:58,399 --> 00:22:01,085
You know, did I think about him?

271
00:22:01,109 --> 00:22:03,302
Maybe yeah, maybe no.

272
00:22:09,649 --> 00:22:11,485
At that time I
was just thinking 'Well,

273
00:22:11,509 --> 00:22:13,822
he gone and I don't know
when he coming home.'

274
00:22:14,809 --> 00:22:16,052
I just wanted him home.

275
00:22:17,779 --> 00:22:21,712
But as I grew older, I
was just disappointed.

276
00:22:30,489 --> 00:22:34,052
So now, I just told him,
'Just stay out the way.

277
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:37,507
If you've just got some good going on,

278
00:22:37,531 --> 00:22:40,565
just stick to what you got
going on and that's it.'

279
00:22:40,589 --> 00:22:41,939
If you just settle down.

280
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:43,791
If you just settle down.

281
00:22:43,815 --> 00:22:45,398
Imma settle down.

282
00:22:46,379 --> 00:22:47,562
Settle down and box,

283
00:22:47,586 --> 00:22:48,986
and I'll let you get a punch off.

284
00:23:03,075 --> 00:23:05,242
I can't, I can't.

285
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:09,847
That's it man.

286
00:23:11,277 --> 00:23:12,277
Man.

287
00:23:21,339 --> 00:23:23,362
I just want to hit him hard one time.

288
00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:26,659
Something to rub in his face.

289
00:23:39,909 --> 00:23:42,675
I've been watching
this little scene that um,

290
00:23:42,699 --> 00:23:46,362
Naz wanted me to look at
something, so Imma take a peek at it.

fucked up on that video.

299
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:24,455
And the reason why I was
fucked up on that video,

300
00:24:24,479 --> 00:24:26,125
I see you doing something,

301
00:24:26,149 --> 00:24:28,225
that I wouldn't approve of or celebrate

302
00:24:28,249 --> 00:24:30,345
and that's slinging that motherfuckin gun

303
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:31,975
and singing that rap shit,

304
00:24:31,999 --> 00:24:34,598
I'm not pleased with it,
I'm not approving that shit,

305
00:24:34,622 --> 00:24:36,935
I don't like that shit.

306
00:24:36,959 --> 00:24:39,842
Me personally, I didn't see Naz.

307
00:24:40,724 --> 00:24:42,015
I didn't see my little bruh,

308
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:46,428
But I need to know who the
fuck that was slinging that shit

309
00:24:46,452 --> 00:24:48,175
and I know it wasn't my little bruh Naz.

310
00:24:48,199 --> 00:24:51,055
That's what I got to say right there.

311
00:24:51,079 --> 00:24:53,246
That wasn't you bruh.

312
00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:06,662
Today is one of his friend's
birthday and he's not here, right?

313
00:25:07,609 --> 00:25:08,419
Really?

314
00:25:08,443 --> 00:25:10,235
Yeah one of they friend's
birthday but he's not here.

315
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:11,259
He got ki...

316
00:25:11,531 --> 00:25:13,595
That's the one that the cop's killed?

317
00:25:13,619 --> 00:25:15,135
Lot of young Black sons though.

318
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:16,953
That's sick, talking about 18.

319
00:25:16,977 --> 00:25:18,392
Eighteen, I can't believe that,

320
00:25:19,986 --> 00:25:21,854
that's why I'm happy to see my son, 18.

321
00:25:24,433 --> 00:25:31,013
♪ Happy Birthday Dear Nazir
Happy Birthday to you ♪

322
00:25:39,879 --> 00:25:41,623
They didn't put it
in a freezer or no?

323
00:25:43,479 --> 00:25:44,519
We just gonna scoop it up.

324
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:50,359
Yeah, my son 18, they say you look nice,
then I'm like thank you.

325
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,192
Naz is cool like his mother.

326
00:26:00,628 --> 00:26:02,075
My mom always tell me that,

327
00:26:02,099 --> 00:26:05,775
society is waiting for a slip up.

328
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:08,735
For me, it's just outside usually

329
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:11,155
I find myself hanging
with the wrong people.

330
00:26:11,179 --> 00:26:13,855
Like last year when I got locked up,

331
00:26:13,879 --> 00:26:16,675
and that's how it is,
they waiting for a slip up,

332
00:26:16,699 --> 00:26:17,978
so they can send me right back in there.

333
00:26:18,002 --> 00:26:20,435
That had to be in 2000 'cause
he probably was like five months.

334
00:26:20,459 --> 00:26:24,655
I'm strong, nothing
really can bother me,

335
00:26:24,679 --> 00:26:29,345
'caus this is Ramadan
and I can go to jummah on Fridays

336
00:26:29,369 --> 00:26:32,509
and usually it made me just
feel like a cleansed person.

337
00:26:33,432 --> 00:26:35,889
Like I just cleaned myself.

338
00:26:37,899 --> 00:26:39,612
Usually it's Jummah to clear my mind.

339
00:26:43,979 --> 00:26:46,565
Stop you know I'm fat you
can't give me rib shots.

340
00:26:46,589 --> 00:26:48,512
Now give your mother a hug.

341
00:26:50,944 --> 00:26:53,235
Aaah!

342
00:26:53,259 --> 00:26:54,259
Damn!

343
00:27:15,137 --> 00:27:17,935
45-year-old Kofi Owens was shot

344
00:27:17,959 --> 00:27:20,615
and killed around 1:00 a.m.
on South 16th street

345
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:21,792
in East orange.

346
00:27:24,449 --> 00:27:26,945
Owen's wife exclusively
tells us her husband,

347
00:27:26,969 --> 00:27:30,185
her high school sweetheart and
father of their two children,

348
00:27:30,209 --> 00:27:32,695
was sitting in a car
with his 25-year-old son,

349
00:27:32,719 --> 00:27:36,342
and a former student when Owens
and his son were both shot.

350
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:42,862
Kofi, we honour you.

351
00:27:43,949 --> 00:27:47,362
We thank you for the life,
you share with the world.

352
00:27:48,229 --> 00:27:51,752
We speak your name, rest well.

353
00:27:53,469 --> 00:27:55,425
And now I'd like to bring up,

354
00:27:55,449 --> 00:27:58,132
Mr. Owens's mother Gloria Owens.

355
00:27:59,339 --> 00:28:03,562
I just want to
say that, he was a blessing.

356
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:10,655
I was thinking we could march
on Washington, we can march,

357
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:12,555
in the streets.

358
00:28:12,579 --> 00:28:15,312
But we need to march for our children.

359
00:28:16,338 --> 00:28:17,725
What is the plan?

360
00:28:17,749 --> 00:28:21,652
It takes a village to
raise a child, children.

361
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:24,412
Who are you raising today?

362
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:26,919
Who are you mentoring today?

363
00:28:28,209 --> 00:28:34,379
So I'm asking, that you rise
up, and raise this village.

364
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:13,710
You gotta live not die.

365
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:17,192
It's not hard to die.

366
00:29:18,569 --> 00:29:20,922
But they make it to
where it's hard to live.

367
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:26,302
'Cause you dying now
and you don't even know it.

368
00:29:32,226 --> 00:29:33,962
I know how to nurse the body.

369
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:38,102
I know how to help the body.

370
00:29:40,502 --> 00:29:42,752
I'm not afraid of the body.

371
00:29:46,669 --> 00:29:49,246
I hold them in my arms,

372
00:29:51,199 --> 00:29:53,858
to let them I guess to get a smell on me,

373
00:29:53,882 --> 00:29:58,069
get a whiff at me, or just
they be right here.

374
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:17,288
Where's my Roman Candle?

375
00:30:18,846 --> 00:30:21,934
Hurry up, hurry up Shamir light this.

376
00:30:21,958 --> 00:30:24,309
Do mines too, at the same time.

377
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:36,020
We lit, ah, we lit.

378
00:30:44,516 --> 00:30:45,572
I want juice.

379
00:30:46,539 --> 00:30:47,655
You ain't getting no juice.

380
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,035
I want juice.

381
00:30:49,059 --> 00:30:50,442
Tyree stop, get off.

382
00:30:52,376 --> 00:30:55,644
Go get you a 50 cent juice, go, go, go

383
00:30:55,668 --> 00:30:57,792
I can't go in there...

384
00:30:57,816 --> 00:31:00,316
Go, go I'm telling you to go.

385
00:31:01,542 --> 00:31:06,323
When I'm alone, I talk
to God, sometimes.

386
00:31:09,827 --> 00:31:12,565
What do you guys talk about?

387
00:31:12,589 --> 00:31:14,922
That's between me and God.

388
00:31:19,249 --> 00:31:20,565
That's between me and God.

389
00:31:20,589 --> 00:31:22,042
I can't tell my prayers.

390
00:31:40,549 --> 00:31:44,135
I was walking, the cops, I was walking.

391
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:47,562
But they said they had my
description or whatever,

392
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:49,912
and then they grabbed me.

393
00:31:52,299 --> 00:31:56,065
I got locked up on 12th Ave,
I'm like I live right here.

394
00:31:56,089 --> 00:31:58,215
They didn't catch me in no car or nothing,

395
00:31:58,239 --> 00:32:00,085
they just put me there.

396
00:32:00,109 --> 00:32:02,535
They didn't find no key on me.

397
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,265
They didn't find me in the car.

398
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:07,595
I was blocks away from "the car".

399
00:32:07,619 --> 00:32:09,285
That's how it is.

400
00:32:09,309 --> 00:32:12,495
They know I've been locked
up for stolen cars so

401
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:13,519
why not?

402
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:18,325
I know he don't be out there
with drugs or guns

403
00:32:18,349 --> 00:32:19,216
or anything like that,

404
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,472
but if he's out there he's affiliated.

405
00:32:23,289 --> 00:32:24,852
I was doing good too.

406
00:32:26,413 --> 00:32:29,812
Just when they see you doing
good, they smack you, boom.

407
00:32:53,669 --> 00:32:56,735
I had a really, really good
mom, my mom was really good.

408
00:32:56,759 --> 00:32:57,909
So she helped me a lot.

409
00:32:58,749 --> 00:33:04,649
Just making sure that, Nazir
had the best of everything.

410
00:33:05,729 --> 00:33:07,555
He was in the house a lot with my mother,

411
00:33:07,579 --> 00:33:09,085
he was really close to my mom,

412
00:33:09,109 --> 00:33:12,022
but she passed away in 2014.

413
00:33:15,029 --> 00:33:17,485
He was the one who was there,
he had to call the ambulance,

414
00:33:17,509 --> 00:33:20,162
He had to ride in the ambulance
he was the one who was with her.

415
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:25,025
As an adult when you grieve,

416
00:33:25,049 --> 00:33:27,165
it's kind of hard for you. As a child,

417
00:33:27,189 --> 00:33:29,425
I think it's actually harder.

418
00:33:29,449 --> 00:33:32,385
He was grieving, but I've
had to start dealing with him

419
00:33:32,409 --> 00:33:34,222
actually like getting into trouble.

420
00:33:35,887 --> 00:33:37,845
I'm still grieving my mom,

421
00:33:37,869 --> 00:33:39,925
but I still have to be a mom.

422
00:33:39,949 --> 00:33:41,935
He never was in trouble
until my mom passed

423
00:33:41,959 --> 00:33:44,402
so it's really, really
hard. It's really hard.

424
00:34:01,576 --> 00:34:02,768
How may I help you?

425
00:34:02,792 --> 00:34:04,966
Can you transfer me to the ER?

426
00:34:06,528 --> 00:34:07,528
To the ER?
Yes.

427
00:34:08,195 --> 00:34:09,906
Sure. Hold on one second.

428
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:17,855
Hello, can you tell me Tom Masino's status?

429
00:34:17,879 --> 00:34:20,333
I can't give you
anybody's status over the phone.

430
00:34:20,969 --> 00:34:22,165
Okay.

431
00:34:22,189 --> 00:34:23,472
Okay, thanks.

432
00:34:35,552 --> 00:34:36,792
Guess what?

433
00:34:36,816 --> 00:34:38,055
What?

434
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,467
Mommy had to get seven staples,

435
00:34:40,491 --> 00:34:42,422
on top of her head.

436
00:34:43,704 --> 00:34:45,024
What happened?
He pushed her down?

437
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:47,202
He pushed her into the radiator.

438
00:34:48,925 --> 00:34:50,999
Oh my god.

439
00:34:51,023 --> 00:34:54,025
She gotta go back on
the 8th to get stitches.

440
00:34:54,049 --> 00:34:56,255
She got staples in her head now.

441
00:34:56,279 --> 00:34:58,512
It's all blood all over
her hair and stuff.

442
00:35:00,321 --> 00:35:02,562
I don't fucking believe
it. I just don't believe it.

443
00:35:17,909 --> 00:35:20,359
Last night, I was
sleeping in my mom's room.

444
00:35:23,259 --> 00:35:27,465
My mom went to sleep. He kept
making noise and stuff.

445
00:35:27,489 --> 00:35:29,822
So I got up and went in my room.

446
00:35:31,919 --> 00:35:36,462
He was all drunked up,
smoking, drinking stuff.

447
00:35:37,929 --> 00:35:41,465
Then he kept saying stuff to
me so I was like, 'Suck my dick.'

448
00:35:41,489 --> 00:35:44,962
He started hitting me when we
got on the porch, he hit me.

449
00:35:51,559 --> 00:35:53,742
Has he hit you
before when he's drunk?

450
00:35:58,749 --> 00:36:01,386
I don't wanna talk about that.

451
00:36:12,009 --> 00:36:13,652
Because I should have never left.

452
00:36:49,061 --> 00:36:50,394
Yeah assalam alaikum.

453
00:36:52,901 --> 00:36:54,401
I'm at my sister's.

454
00:36:57,849 --> 00:37:02,849
I thank Allah much for my
family, my sisters, my niece

455
00:37:04,279 --> 00:37:05,805
and my mom.

456
00:37:05,829 --> 00:37:10,222
Because of them, I have
somewhere to rest my head,

457
00:37:12,129 --> 00:37:14,815
but sometimes I just
don't want to go nowhere,

458
00:37:14,839 --> 00:37:15,839
stay in that damn car.

459
00:37:23,489 --> 00:37:25,189
Let me share something with y'all.

460
00:37:28,702 --> 00:37:31,082
I had an opportunity to sell
drugs just a couple days ago.

461
00:37:32,229 --> 00:37:33,632
I had it in my hand.

462
00:37:36,059 --> 00:37:37,206
I was so scared.

463
00:37:38,069 --> 00:37:41,555
I had a shot at it, strong shot at it.

464
00:37:41,579 --> 00:37:45,385
Did for a couple of hours, two hours.

465
00:37:45,409 --> 00:37:50,409
Shittin' me. I hold on to that thing,
he straight convinced me.

466
00:37:53,369 --> 00:37:55,895
Laid the money out to me
and how much money,

467
00:37:55,919 --> 00:37:58,172
What it can be, what we can do.

468
00:38:01,909 --> 00:38:03,792
So damn scared bruh, I gave it back,

469
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:06,712
because I can't live that life.

470
00:38:13,149 --> 00:38:15,795
I'm struggling man to make
it to where I gotta make it,

471
00:38:15,819 --> 00:38:17,252
to go to where I want to go.

472
00:38:19,661 --> 00:38:20,586
How I'm gonna get there.

473
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:22,559
Is keeping my head up, keeping my focus.

474
00:38:23,489 --> 00:38:24,373
How imma get there?

475
00:38:24,397 --> 00:38:25,949
In trying to save a life.

476
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:41,065
Did he tell you what
happened a couple weeks ago?

477
00:38:41,089 --> 00:38:43,205
What about her head?

478
00:38:43,229 --> 00:38:45,022
Yeah, what happened
to Furquan as well.

479
00:38:45,046 --> 00:38:48,842
No, he hasn't said it
to me yet, we'll talk.

480
00:38:50,486 --> 00:38:55,006
But I really feel, she
has to sign over papers,

481
00:38:56,479 --> 00:38:58,605
For me to get him in school down there.

482
00:38:58,629 --> 00:39:03,385
But I know that if he is
in, a different environment,

483
00:39:03,409 --> 00:39:04,859
he'll be a different kid.

484
00:39:06,039 --> 00:39:08,695
Like I told you, you fall into a rut,

485
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:11,865
it's like a deep hole, And
no matter how much you dig

486
00:39:11,889 --> 00:39:15,745
and scratch and scrape, you can't get out,

487
00:39:15,769 --> 00:39:17,312
That's the way your mother is.

488
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:21,602
But that doesn't mean that
you have to go through that.

489
00:39:23,999 --> 00:39:24,999
That's your mother.

490
00:39:26,139 --> 00:39:27,295
That's not you.

491
00:39:27,319 --> 00:39:29,155
You're a whole different person.

492
00:39:29,179 --> 00:39:31,366
You got your whole life ahead of you.

493
00:39:38,873 --> 00:39:39,683
Right when he comes back.

494
00:39:39,707 --> 00:39:40,815
He's gonna realize
how much I care for him.

495
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:43,768
I'm not leaving, I'm
gonna stay down there.

496
00:39:43,792 --> 00:39:44,896
Might be good for you,

497
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,975
Have you thought about that?

498
00:39:45,999 --> 00:39:46,956
I'm gonna miss you.

499
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:49,033
That's all right man.

500
00:39:49,057 --> 00:39:50,472
As long as I know you're alive,

501
00:39:50,496 --> 00:39:52,737
I'll make it my business to get at you.

502
00:39:52,761 --> 00:39:54,692
How about that?

503
00:39:54,716 --> 00:39:57,316
Give Furquan a hug and a kiss.

504
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:59,490
Make sure you call when
you get down there, okay?

505
00:40:18,903 --> 00:40:20,570
What's up nigga?

506
00:40:23,056 --> 00:40:24,922
You gotta get a hair cut, dude.

507
00:40:26,046 --> 00:40:28,499
When you gonna get a hair cut?

508
00:40:28,523 --> 00:40:29,523
I don't know.

509
00:40:30,189 --> 00:40:31,832
He gave me a curfew anyway.

510
00:40:32,779 --> 00:40:34,825
What's the curfew?

511
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:35,849
Eight o'clock.

512
00:40:39,179 --> 00:40:41,102
Me being in the house all day?

513
00:40:42,069 --> 00:40:43,252
I can't do that.

514
00:40:44,539 --> 00:40:48,255
I don't even know, I go
to probation on Mondays.

515
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,875
I got to text my probation
officer every night,

516
00:40:50,899 --> 00:40:52,725
Tell him I'm in the house.

517
00:40:52,749 --> 00:40:57,375
And I've only been on my
brace for prolly like two days.

518
00:40:57,399 --> 00:41:01,202
It's like somebody's just tracking
me every day of my life.

519
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:06,715
I'm free now but it's kinda like I'm not.

520
00:41:06,739 --> 00:41:10,745
It's like I'm outside but like I'm inside.

521
00:41:10,769 --> 00:41:13,255
Because every time I
turn around, it's court,

522
00:41:13,279 --> 00:41:16,912
court, probation officer
popping up to my house.

523
00:41:17,814 --> 00:41:21,322
There is always something,
and the school I'm at now,

524
00:41:21,346 --> 00:41:26,415
you miss one class it feels
like you missed a lot of stuff.

525
00:41:26,439 --> 00:41:28,625
So one minute I'm in class learning it

526
00:41:28,649 --> 00:41:33,635
and finally getting the way
things is in class.

527
00:41:33,659 --> 00:41:35,095
And then the next minute,

528
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:37,869
I'm just lost because I gotta
go to court or something.

529
00:41:40,009 --> 00:41:44,732
I thought it was gonna be
easy I guess, but it's not.

530
00:41:47,459 --> 00:41:49,602
This thing prolly gonna get chopped off.

531
00:41:56,199 --> 00:41:58,315
Young man, if he talks, I don't know.

532
00:41:58,339 --> 00:42:01,012
He probably say I didn't mean to call you.

533
00:42:02,606 --> 00:42:03,685
What's up black man?

534
00:42:03,709 --> 00:42:05,759
Get out your nose you
gonna eat the boogers?

535
00:42:07,592 --> 00:42:08,740
Come on man.

536
00:42:14,665 --> 00:42:16,756
Get some tissue in that shit.

537
00:42:17,956 --> 00:42:20,352
That shit don't look right bruh.

538
00:42:23,899 --> 00:42:25,265
Let me finish what I'm doing.

539
00:42:25,289 --> 00:42:27,730
I'm making caskets right
now I gotta finish up.

540
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:29,434
All right.
But Imma send you some pictures,

541
00:42:29,511 --> 00:42:32,782
I want you to see that's what
I do just to let you know.

542
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:35,846
I love you Monkey.

543
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:37,152
I love you too champ.

544
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:06,570
Bulletproof.

545
00:43:08,108 --> 00:43:10,023
Let's see.

546
00:43:19,089 --> 00:43:22,125
Individual teachers will
provide a list of items needed

547
00:43:22,149 --> 00:43:23,785
for their class at open house.

548
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:26,325
So of course, we didn't go to open house.

549
00:43:26,349 --> 00:43:29,165
Because that was before
you was even down here.

550
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:30,779
Here's the erasers you need.

551
00:43:31,739 --> 00:43:34,145
Says number 2 pencils,
that's what you got.

552
00:43:34,169 --> 00:43:38,735
This is two packs of 20,
but I think that's to share.

553
00:43:38,759 --> 00:43:39,755
I'm not sharing.

554
00:43:39,779 --> 00:43:43,545
Yes you are, we do what we're
supposed to do here, okay?

555
00:43:43,569 --> 00:43:44,925
That's for kids that come to school

556
00:43:44,949 --> 00:43:46,885
that may not have a pencil.

557
00:43:46,909 --> 00:43:50,065
Just like if you happen to go
to school and don't have a pencil.

558
00:43:50,089 --> 00:43:51,265
That's why we do that.

559
00:43:51,289 --> 00:43:52,935
That's how they do it here.

560
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:54,335
You don't want to go the first day

561
00:43:54,359 --> 00:43:56,859
up and down and I need
this and I need that,

562
00:43:56,883 --> 00:43:58,875
I want to make sure you're prepared.

563
00:43:58,899 --> 00:44:00,375
Okay?

564
00:44:00,399 --> 00:44:02,665
You got to remember you're
in a whole new environment,

565
00:44:02,689 --> 00:44:03,982
whole new rules.

566
00:44:05,005 --> 00:44:06,005
Okay?

567
00:44:21,639 --> 00:44:24,537
Nazir! Keerah!

568
00:44:26,959 --> 00:44:28,315
Yo, what the fuck man,

569
00:44:28,339 --> 00:44:30,087
Your mom said you try to cut
that shit off.

570
00:44:30,111 --> 00:44:31,284
It's cut.

571
00:44:31,308 --> 00:44:33,475
What the fuck you cut it for?

572
00:44:34,459 --> 00:44:35,459
You can't.

573
00:44:36,933 --> 00:44:38,487
How did you
manage to cut the motherfucker off?

574
00:44:38,511 --> 00:44:40,167
With a knife.

575
00:44:40,191 --> 00:44:41,155
And it came off?

576
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:42,179
Yeah.

577
00:44:43,611 --> 00:44:44,436
What made you do it man?

578
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:47,212
What the fuck happened
man, explain that man.

579
00:44:47,236 --> 00:44:51,115
I need to know, what you got
to tell me man this is not you.

580
00:44:51,139 --> 00:44:55,445
I'm on a brace, but my mother every time.

581
00:44:55,469 --> 00:44:59,835
We get into an argument or
something is 'Oh I'll call a cop or

582
00:44:59,859 --> 00:45:02,635
I should have told them to keep you.'

583
00:45:02,659 --> 00:45:04,715
That's Keerah. That's your mother.

584
00:45:04,739 --> 00:45:07,045
She's like that because
its her emotions man,

585
00:45:07,069 --> 00:45:09,669
Because she knows she's fighting
that battle by herself.

586
00:45:10,969 --> 00:45:12,705
You still going to the program?

587
00:45:12,729 --> 00:45:13,784
Nah.

588
00:45:13,808 --> 00:45:15,995
Oh God.

589
00:45:16,019 --> 00:45:17,945
Be careful man.

590
00:45:17,969 --> 00:45:20,819
If I go to the program they
can come get me from there.

591
00:45:21,679 --> 00:45:23,479
So now you on the move,
'cause you frustrated.

592
00:45:24,979 --> 00:45:27,375
Fuck that man, I've
fucked up a lot of times,

593
00:45:27,399 --> 00:45:30,651
but I'm not gonna do nothing to
jeopardize my life.

594
00:45:30,675 --> 00:45:32,395
That ain't gonna happen bruh.

595
00:45:32,419 --> 00:45:35,912
You know how many times Naz I
wanna fucking get high to numb myself,

596
00:45:36,769 --> 00:45:40,092
to numb myself to try and
escape the reality of it.

597
00:45:41,041 --> 00:45:43,055
That shit ain't happening man.

598
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:44,262
Yeah I don't know man.

599
00:45:53,679 --> 00:45:54,732
That shit hurt me man.

600
00:45:57,844 --> 00:45:59,582
That hurt me man.

601
00:47:29,718 --> 00:47:32,141
Okay, I'm getting in. Stop.

602
00:47:32,346 --> 00:47:33,346
Aaah! Stop.

603
00:47:37,723 --> 00:47:39,056
Man forget this.

604
00:47:40,366 --> 00:47:43,069
Aaah! Jesus, stop.

605
00:47:47,491 --> 00:47:48,741
Mom!

606
00:47:50,633 --> 00:47:51,443
Stop.

607
00:47:51,467 --> 00:47:54,815
I made some bad decisions
down here in school.

608
00:47:54,839 --> 00:47:57,815
So a kid just kept saying 'Jersey Boy,

609
00:47:57,839 --> 00:47:59,545
Jersey Boy what you gonna do?'

610
00:47:59,569 --> 00:48:03,605
So I choked him up, I yoked him up,

611
00:48:03,629 --> 00:48:07,205
grabbed him by the neck and
threw him on the ground.

612
00:48:07,229 --> 00:48:09,946
That's when the maths teacher,
came to me and said,

613
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:11,889
'You can't be doing that.'

614
00:48:12,719 --> 00:48:15,796
But they're like all
red necks and stuff like that.

615
00:48:16,715 --> 00:48:19,025
You know how they call us the N-word?

616
00:48:19,049 --> 00:48:20,972
We call them red necks.

617
00:48:24,419 --> 00:48:27,625
I've tried to remember
the situation he's in.

618
00:48:27,649 --> 00:48:31,015
But I also tell him that
he can't use that as a

619
00:48:31,039 --> 00:48:35,115
crutch no longer, because he's not there.

620
00:48:35,139 --> 00:48:36,139
He's here.

621
00:48:58,194 --> 00:49:00,515
The month of Ramadan is that in which,

622
00:49:00,539 --> 00:49:02,565
the Quran was revealed.

623
00:49:02,909 --> 00:49:06,885
Therefore, whoever of you
who is present in the month,

624
00:49:06,909 --> 00:49:09,709
shall fast a right number of days.

625
00:49:46,369 --> 00:49:48,132
Last Ramadan I was home.

626
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:52,432
So I still start my day
off how I want I want

627
00:49:52,456 --> 00:49:54,195
and fast regular.

628
00:49:54,219 --> 00:49:56,192
But now it's too hard.

629
00:49:57,339 --> 00:49:58,955
Because I'm running in the streets,

630
00:49:58,979 --> 00:50:03,245
I don't got a balanced
sahoor meal in the morning,

631
00:50:03,269 --> 00:50:05,865
plus running the streets, its hard.

632
00:50:05,889 --> 00:50:07,768
I don't know why you
think your comfortable

633
00:50:07,792 --> 00:50:09,975
in this motherfuckin street, bruh,
'cause you're not.

634
00:50:09,999 --> 00:50:12,825
Me personally I say get
rest, get normal rest,

635
00:50:12,849 --> 00:50:16,545
shower, eat, change clothes,
go home and do that shit, bruh.

636
00:50:16,569 --> 00:50:20,742
But they already know like
once I cut off the brace,

637
00:50:21,703 --> 00:50:23,355
they have a warrant issued out for you.

638
00:50:23,379 --> 00:50:25,045
So they know I'm on the run.

639
00:50:25,069 --> 00:50:26,316
They tryin' to get me.

640
00:50:28,382 --> 00:50:30,785
I know it's hard for you right now,
'cause you tryin' to fast.

641
00:50:30,809 --> 00:50:32,065
Yeah, it's gonna be hard because you

642
00:50:32,089 --> 00:50:34,739
worry about these pigs and
which way they gonna come.

643
00:50:35,789 --> 00:50:38,615
I've been locked up a lot of times.

644
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:42,562
I've been put on probation,
I've been put on braces but,

645
00:50:44,209 --> 00:50:46,642
to a certain amount
that you could take,

646
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:48,912
'till you're just like 'I'm done.'

647
00:50:50,949 --> 00:50:52,465
Even though you don't want to be done,

648
00:50:52,489 --> 00:50:54,405
you just like 'I'm done.'

649
00:50:54,429 --> 00:50:56,192
I can't do it, I can't do it.

650
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:12,852
Amen, glory
hallelujah church say Amen.

651
00:51:12,876 --> 00:51:15,565
Amen.

652
00:51:15,589 --> 00:51:20,589
Your lord and saviour Jesus
Christ, praise God hallelujah.

653
00:51:20,788 --> 00:51:24,092
We couldn't be here this
morning, give him glory,

654
00:51:24,116 --> 00:51:27,452
we give him honour and we give him praise.

655
00:51:27,476 --> 00:51:29,226
Praise God hallelujah.

656
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:43,642
Come on down and give
up to Jesus, praise God.

657
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:47,187
If you ain't got positive
influences in your life,

658
00:51:48,323 --> 00:51:53,068
you're subject to fall through the
street, the gangs, the drugs,

659
00:51:54,489 --> 00:52:00,076
I know, because I lived it and
when I first got locked up,

660
00:52:00,149 --> 00:52:01,699
I was facing the death penalty.

661
00:52:02,799 --> 00:52:07,097
That's what I had but
by His grace and mercy,

662
00:52:07,121 --> 00:52:08,621
I didn't get that.

663
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:12,209
It come to a point I realized
I had to make a change.

664
00:52:26,589 --> 00:52:28,989
Take me off speaker real quick
I got to tell you something.

665
00:52:33,059 --> 00:52:34,215
Make sure he can't hear me

666
00:52:34,239 --> 00:52:35,585
because on what I'm
getting ready to tell you.

667
00:52:35,609 --> 00:52:37,315
Yeah yeah yeah.

668
00:52:37,339 --> 00:52:38,415
Naz got locked up.

669
00:52:38,439 --> 00:52:40,765
Aww, man.

670
00:52:40,789 --> 00:52:42,492
Yeah, Keerah's son.

671
00:52:43,737 --> 00:52:44,993
When, this week?

672
00:52:45,017 --> 00:52:47,389
Couple of days ago, police come

673
00:52:48,483 --> 00:52:50,283
and say they charging him for murder.

674
00:52:51,797 --> 00:52:53,555
Aww, man.

675
00:52:53,579 --> 00:52:54,579
Yeah.

676
00:52:57,174 --> 00:52:59,301
I'm gonna get in and
do a little more for him.

677
00:52:59,336 --> 00:53:02,453
'Cause he not gonna get away,
I can't let him get away.

678
00:53:02,477 --> 00:53:03,977
I can't let him get away, man.

679
00:53:32,761 --> 00:53:36,185
Naz, you're not built like
that son, you're not Naz,

680
00:53:36,209 --> 00:53:37,146
you're not son.

681
00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:38,949
Please understand you're not Naz,

682
00:53:38,973 --> 00:53:40,823
you're not bruh,
you're not built like that.

683
00:53:42,721 --> 00:53:44,135
It ain't for you to go that route.

684
00:53:44,159 --> 00:53:47,295
'Cause it's gonna come at you
at the end of the day,

685
00:53:47,319 --> 00:53:48,542
It's gonna come at you.

686
00:53:59,493 --> 00:54:02,993
Two, one, seven, eight.

687
00:54:20,749 --> 00:54:24,155
Your Honour, has a p-number
associated with a warrant that should be

688
00:54:24,179 --> 00:54:27,605
receiving stolen property
and resisting arrest for Mr. Powell.

689
00:54:27,629 --> 00:54:31,702
That case was merged last
week into a homicide file,

690
00:54:32,537 --> 00:54:35,253
which is currently pending.

691
00:54:35,277 --> 00:54:38,945
When they call me like, 'Is
this the parent of Nazir?'

692
00:54:38,969 --> 00:54:42,162
I always get like 'What
happened to my son?'

693
00:54:43,589 --> 00:54:48,589
Please don't tell me that I
have to go identify a body.

694
00:54:55,249 --> 00:54:58,945
I don't want my son
to spend his first adult years,

695
00:54:58,969 --> 00:55:03,345
in jail, but in the streets, you might die

696
00:55:03,369 --> 00:55:05,512
from being in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

697
00:55:33,914 --> 00:55:36,209
Gonna be in stance,
right over left, left over right.

698
00:55:40,122 --> 00:55:41,302
Stuff like that.

699
00:55:42,649 --> 00:55:45,135
Calms me down, let's me
get my anger out when

700
00:55:45,159 --> 00:55:47,025
I go out there on the mat.

701
00:55:47,049 --> 00:55:48,555
'Cause all that stuff
that happened to me

702
00:55:48,579 --> 00:55:51,935
when I was little and stuff like people

703
00:55:51,959 --> 00:55:54,302
hitting me and stuff like that.

704
00:55:56,509 --> 00:55:59,929
To come down here, that's
what I was praying for.

705
00:56:01,146 --> 00:56:04,188
That's good, see God answers
your prayers, doesn't he?

706
00:56:04,212 --> 00:56:05,212
Yeah.

707
00:56:13,152 --> 00:56:13,962
Yo!

708
00:56:13,986 --> 00:56:15,680
It's your mama.

709
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,421
Yo man! I wanna come down
there and see you my dude!

710
00:56:22,569 --> 00:56:25,079
Come down here then, you got $600?

711
00:56:26,156 --> 00:56:28,323
To wrestle you?

712
00:56:30,044 --> 00:56:31,155
Yeah anytime.

713
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:32,765
Yeah, we're gonna go to the gym

714
00:56:32,789 --> 00:56:34,965
we will let people see us wrestle.

715
00:56:34,989 --> 00:56:39,784
I want to let them see me pick you up

716
00:56:39,808 --> 00:56:42,224
and drop you on your head.

717
00:56:44,668 --> 00:56:46,587
I'm playing, bruh.

718
00:56:46,611 --> 00:56:47,875
You be doing good though?

719
00:56:47,899 --> 00:56:49,217
How is school coming along?

720
00:56:49,241 --> 00:56:51,537
It's going good.

721
00:56:51,561 --> 00:56:53,936
Keep doing what you're doing.

722
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:55,377
There's nothing out here.

723
00:56:56,796 --> 00:56:58,315
Try to be out here to survive, that's it.

724
00:56:58,339 --> 00:57:00,314
Yeah.

725
00:57:00,338 --> 00:57:02,358
Alright, I'll talk to you later.

726
00:57:02,382 --> 00:57:03,335
You want to run and go now,

727
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:04,722
make sure you take a bite of

728
00:57:04,746 --> 00:57:06,122
pork chops for me.

729
00:57:07,926 --> 00:57:09,234
Bye, I'll see you later.

730
00:57:09,258 --> 00:57:10,515
All right, I love you be good man.

731
00:57:10,539 --> 00:57:11,348
Keep doing what you're doing.

732
00:57:11,372 --> 00:57:12,372
I'm proud of you.

733
00:57:22,267 --> 00:57:27,184
I would like to give him a
hug for him to feel my energy.

734
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:30,492
But bruh, right now I'm kind of hurting.

735
00:57:33,699 --> 00:57:36,412
And I'm trying to figure
out maybe the wrong things,

736
00:57:37,539 --> 00:57:39,065
of what I'm doing.

737
00:57:39,089 --> 00:57:40,858
What you mean by that?

738
00:57:40,882 --> 00:57:45,882
That's my point, I don't
know what I mean by that.

739
00:59:07,416 --> 00:59:12,416
I had a little incident,
happened to me over the week.

740
00:59:14,408 --> 00:59:15,508
Where I got locked up.

741
00:59:33,559 --> 00:59:38,033
At the end of the day
I can't blame nobody.

742
00:59:40,388 --> 00:59:41,842
I can't.

743
00:59:41,866 --> 00:59:44,232
And I'm hurt.

744
00:59:46,719 --> 00:59:48,332
What the hell did I do?

745
00:59:51,579 --> 00:59:53,272
Was all this worth it?

746
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:14,647
Someone in our
own circle, grown person

747
01:00:17,548 --> 01:00:20,242
thought apparently the same
thing these kids thought.

748
01:00:21,749 --> 01:00:25,405
Where did you find it
to be worth anything

749
01:00:25,429 --> 01:00:29,212
if you end up in a
penitentiary or in a cemetery.

750
01:00:31,209 --> 01:00:33,572
I don't care what kind of life you live.

751
01:00:40,649 --> 01:00:44,045
When the washers
and other people come through,

752
01:00:44,069 --> 01:00:48,312
I don't know who they know,
I don't know what they do.

753
01:00:49,749 --> 01:00:52,872
But people are relying on me.

754
01:00:59,528 --> 01:01:02,035
And the brother Hanif, you know,

755
01:01:02,059 --> 01:01:04,602
I'll tell him, I still love you,

756
01:01:06,169 --> 01:01:07,579
but you can't come in here.

757
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:30,670
Boom, they got
fireworks son, I want some.

758
01:02:33,964 --> 01:02:36,815
I just want to visit my brother
and my Nana.

759
01:02:36,839 --> 01:02:39,055
See how my grandma been doing.

760
01:02:39,079 --> 01:02:42,739
She been in the hospital a few
times and stuff like that,

761
01:02:43,796 --> 01:02:46,296
and I just want her to
feel like I care about her.

762
01:03:05,319 --> 01:03:08,155
I'm gonna have to go
away for a little while.

763
01:03:08,179 --> 01:03:12,082
Maybe get my strength
up but I'm just so sick.

764
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:14,985
Tyree you got to get away
because you're standing right in

765
01:03:15,009 --> 01:03:16,502
front of that fan.

766
01:03:26,419 --> 01:03:27,228
You all be good.

767
01:03:27,252 --> 01:03:28,252
What do you need?

768
01:03:29,139 --> 01:03:29,949
Me?

769
01:03:29,973 --> 01:03:31,463
Yeah. Do you need anything?

770
01:03:31,487 --> 01:03:32,297
I don't need anything, no.

771
01:03:32,321 --> 01:03:36,035
All right, Nana let me borrow $50 please.

772
01:03:36,059 --> 01:03:37,909
Yeah in another life.

773
01:03:44,722 --> 01:03:47,792
When he came here,
he came here to see me.

774
01:03:50,339 --> 01:03:52,652
I told Furquan I'm sick.

775
01:03:53,659 --> 01:03:55,909
I know he loves me and
I know he loves Tyree.

776
01:03:57,049 --> 01:03:58,985
But you know what I think too?

777
01:03:59,009 --> 01:04:02,302
As long as he stays where
he's at with Aunt Barbara.

778
01:04:04,093 --> 01:04:07,972
I think he's gonna do good.

779
01:04:47,319 --> 01:04:51,502
See for me today, we
don't come to mourn her death.

780
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:54,412
But we're here to celebrate her life.

781
01:04:55,819 --> 01:04:58,855
So next we're going to
have Furquan give us

782
01:04:58,879 --> 01:05:00,179
the Old and New Testament.

783
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:06,535
Isaiah 41:10, "Fear though
not for I am with thee,

784
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:09,725
be not dismayed for I thy God,

785
01:05:09,749 --> 01:05:11,555
I will strengthen thee,

786
01:05:11,579 --> 01:05:13,375
I will help thee

787
01:05:13,399 --> 01:05:15,655
I will uphold thee

788
01:05:15,679 --> 01:05:18,622
with the right hand of righteousness...

789
01:05:20,109 --> 01:05:21,272
Amen somebody?

790
01:05:21,296 --> 01:05:22,546
Amen.

791
01:06:20,939 --> 01:06:25,939
Naz I don't think he did the murder,
but if he did,

792
01:06:27,509 --> 01:06:28,509
he is done.

793
01:06:32,179 --> 01:06:35,972
That's why a lot of times
is like I failed.

794
01:06:48,672 --> 01:06:55,261
As I look at it now,
as I carry on with it, I didn't fail.

795
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,083
I could be there for him.

796
01:07:01,688 --> 01:07:04,597
I could be there for him.

797
01:08:08,794 --> 01:08:10,878
- Hanif!
- Yeah?

798
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:13,881
Hanif, right here right now, hold on.

799
01:08:14,173 --> 01:08:15,883
What's up my dude?

800
01:08:17,230 --> 01:08:18,860
What's up, as salam alaikum.

801
01:08:18,884 --> 01:08:22,926
You sound like a big boy,
I heard you gaining weight.

802
01:08:23,964 --> 01:08:26,311
Yeah a little something.

803
01:08:26,335 --> 01:08:28,502
Your visits are on Saturdays, right?

804
01:08:32,876 --> 01:08:34,204
If I don't come see you tomorrow,

805
01:08:34,228 --> 01:08:35,919
I'll come see you Thursday inshallah.

806
01:08:38,730 --> 01:08:42,666
If you need any thing else just
Let her know, she'll tell me.

807
01:09:01,019 --> 01:09:02,719
My Nana was the best,

808
01:09:03,609 --> 01:09:05,259
I just wish I could have her back.

809
01:09:09,149 --> 01:09:13,422
I just wanna talk to her, one more time.

810
01:09:14,609 --> 01:09:15,809
Just one more.

811
01:09:40,754 --> 01:09:45,754
I'm at the age where I'm like 'Where
do I go after I die?

812
01:09:49,549 --> 01:09:52,761
How did you get to
choose which one was yours?

813
01:09:52,785 --> 01:09:55,221
Because I wanted this one.

814
01:09:55,245 --> 01:09:58,375
He said because 'Mines bigger
and yours has pink on it.'

815
01:09:58,399 --> 01:10:00,782
I said 'Okay, since it had pink on it.'

816
01:10:04,492 --> 01:10:06,244
I just wanna know where my Nana's at?

817
01:10:07,485 --> 01:10:09,562
Is there really a heaven
or is there really God?

818
01:10:14,649 --> 01:10:15,699
I gotta go outside.

819
01:10:16,625 --> 01:10:19,615
And there go my pin in
wrestling as a freshman,

820
01:10:19,639 --> 01:10:22,585
My seven and eighth grade
years I didn't do so good.

821
01:10:22,609 --> 01:10:25,582
But this year,
I'm slamming them full time.

822
01:10:35,023 --> 01:10:36,083
I know there has to be a God,

823
01:10:36,107 --> 01:10:38,359
'cause how could someone take me
from here to there.

824
01:10:41,363 --> 01:10:44,255
God has been awesome to me, even
though I haven't been awesome to God,

825
01:10:44,323 --> 01:10:45,323
sometimes, but...

826
01:10:49,871 --> 01:10:53,121
I feel like all people go through that.

827
01:11:10,479 --> 01:11:12,646
As salam alaikum.

828
01:11:23,319 --> 01:11:26,652
Happy birthday to you!

829
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:36,083
Yo! I thought something was up.

830
01:13:11,990 --> 01:13:15,365
You know at first, the anger was so deep

831
01:13:15,389 --> 01:13:17,615
because of the disappointment.

832
01:13:17,639 --> 01:13:21,065
I could never have fathomed
in a million years,

833
01:13:21,089 --> 01:13:24,148
him of all people in that situation.

834
01:13:24,172 --> 01:13:26,155
Once you break that little trust barrier,

835
01:13:26,179 --> 01:13:31,179
its kind of difficult to say
'Come on back' with open arms.

836
01:13:32,559 --> 01:13:36,015
But as I continue to toss with it.

837
01:13:36,039 --> 01:13:40,652
Just recently, I see him,
I had a talk with him.

838
01:13:42,729 --> 01:13:46,102
As I embrace him today,
I said to him 'I love you.

839
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:50,805
Do what's right, that's
all I am asking you to do.'

840
01:13:50,829 --> 01:13:52,875
And his word back to me was,

841
01:13:52,899 --> 01:13:55,339
'I got you big bruh, '
and that's all I need.

842
01:14:01,479 --> 01:14:04,398
I know I'm ready, I think he know.

843
01:14:06,632 --> 01:14:09,571
This is pretty much my life.

844
01:14:46,368 --> 01:14:48,535
Yeah! The king! I'm here, I'm back!

845
01:15:25,439 --> 01:15:30,568
Minor setback for a major comeback.

846
01:15:52,173 --> 01:15:53,924
Oh she's going to wear the cap and gown?

847
01:16:39,209 --> 01:16:43,352
The times I was in prison,
I used to watch leaves,

848
01:16:45,119 --> 01:16:46,419
I used to watch squirrels.

849
01:16:47,709 --> 01:16:51,545
How they was running around,
going up in that tree,

850
01:16:51,569 --> 01:16:54,669
getting the little chestnuts
and dropping them.

851
01:16:56,311 --> 01:17:00,116
I used to see shit dropping,
and then come back.

852
01:17:03,286 --> 01:17:07,122
'Cause everything got life.
Everything got life.

853
01:17:12,468 --> 01:17:16,757
So with my impact, I want to
have a strong dynamic impact.

854
01:17:21,864 --> 01:17:24,807
If I deal with me, the
world will see how I live.

855
01:17:57,589 --> 01:18:01,510
Place it right there,
push on it a little bit.

856
01:18:03,589 --> 01:18:05,060
Right here?

857
01:18:05,084 --> 01:18:06,084
Right there.

858
01:18:06,307 --> 01:18:11,687
Push up on it first son, don't
worry about the trigger. Straight aim.
