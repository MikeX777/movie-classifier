1
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,860
 In the past 10 years,

2
00:01:34,862 --> 00:01:37,629
 the pace of communication
 and commerce

3
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:39,531
   accelerated astronomically,
   didn't it?

4
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:43,669
 That lecture was interminable,
 I need an espresso.

5
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,206
<i> Duchess Carrie</i>
      <i> likes espresso.</i>

6
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:49,174
<i> Who's Duchess Carrie?</i>

7
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:52,444
          Duchess Carrie likes
             certain things,
          but not other things.

8
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:54,580
     <i> Can you figure out what</i>
     <i> Duchess Carrie likes?</i>

9
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:58,117
 Caffeinated things?

10
00:01:58,119 --> 00:01:59,551
          Caffeinated?

11
00:01:59,553 --> 00:02:00,752
- Tea?
<i>-  Nope.</i>

12
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,792
      With the Center's latest
      technological innovation,

13
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:10,329
      we are working to empower
      the average person
      with a pragmatic response

14
00:02:10,331 --> 00:02:12,131
  to today's unforgiving jun...

15
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:12,798
           Today's...

16
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,400
       Impenetrable job market.

17
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:21,573
<i> Uh, does she eat?</i>

18
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:24,710
       <i> She eats croissants</i>
       <i> and crabapples.</i>

19
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,413
 She likes things
 that begin with "C"?

20
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:29,748
    No. She enjoys espresso.

21
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,717
             No collaborating.

22
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:33,185
Croissants...

23
00:02:33,187 --> 00:02:34,486
          She's French.

24
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,522
           You need to play
           more games, Jules.

25
00:02:36,524 --> 00:02:38,557
Only one of you
     can be the winner.

26
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:40,192
        If you cheat,
        then nobody wins.

27
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:48,600
- And as a result...
- Adenine...

28
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:49,835
And due
   to overpopulation...
<i> Cytosine.</i>

29
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:51,470
            Cytosine.

30
00:02:51,472 --> 00:02:52,671
- Today's job market...
<i>-  Guanine.</i>

31
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:55,240
            Guanine.

32
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:57,476
There's no surprise that
 anxiety and depression...
<i> Thiamine.</i>

33
00:02:57,478 --> 00:02:58,810
- ...have become the norm.
<i>-  Uracil.</i>

34
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:17,829
<i> Duchess Carrie</i>
   <i> likes looking at the moon.</i>

35
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:19,798
      Duchess Carrie loves
      feeling cool.

36
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,767
      Moon, cool.

37
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:22,968
Double letters...

38
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,903
      Duchess Carrie
      likes double letters.

39
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:26,338
      Jules already got it.

40
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:46,458
Not again.

41
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:14,653
     Where's your umbrella?

42
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:15,520
       <i> It's not raining.</i>

43
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:17,956
       It is in Cherbourg.

44
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:18,924
           <i> Eternally?</i>

45
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:25,397
<i> Dave, you're calling me.</i>

46
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:28,033
  Don't you think we should
  give this a little more time?

47
00:04:28,035 --> 00:04:30,035
      I need to talk to you
      face to face.

48
00:04:30,037 --> 00:04:31,570
<i> I wasn't calling</i>
    <i> about us.</i>

49
00:04:31,572 --> 00:04:33,038
Mom!

50
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,872
       <i> It's something much</i>
       <i> more important.</i>

51
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:35,641
              End call.

52
00:04:35,643 --> 00:04:37,976
- Gwen?
<i>-  This conversation has ended.</i>

53
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:40,979
       That's your mother?

54
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:43,682
Yup.

55
00:04:43,684 --> 00:04:45,817
          She doesn't even look
          like a mom.

56
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:47,419
 Holo me when
 you hear from Arcadia?

57
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:48,720
   Tell her about
   the Eastern Board luncheon.

58
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:51,623
      I'll make sure my mom
      holds you a spot.

59
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:15,013
           I like it.
           It's old looking.

60
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:18,583
                Who was that
                with you guys?
            Amanda Malthis.

61
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:21,486
                Oh, you decided
                you like her?

62
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:22,788
  She has interesting moments.

63
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:27,859
    She wants me
    to go with her to this
    bonding camp for Eastern.

64
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:51,616
So they're saying that
 all this wacky hormonal stuff,

65
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:54,619
   that's coming from pressure
   to be hyper productive.

66
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:58,523
 We have too many choices
 and we're making the same ones
 over and over again.

67
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,125
      And they're the wrong
      choices actually.

68
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:02,627
      So it's like
      natural deselection.

69
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,364
     Our DNA is opting out.

70
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,968
  Did you know that by the time
  I'm 20, I may not have
  any ova left?

71
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:12,838
      You know, for babies.

72
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:18,043
 You'd think awareness
 would help things, but...

73
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:19,444
  Awareness influences things.

74
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:20,746
            It just takes time.

75
00:06:20,748 --> 00:06:21,680
         How much time?

76
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,057
Jules.

77
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:37,129
           Jules.

78
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:40,832
 I was going to tell you when
 you were a little bit older.

79
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:42,701
         About the eggs.

80
00:06:42,703 --> 00:06:45,003
             I can adopt from
             other regions.

81
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:47,005
       There's always going
       to be orphans who aren't
       as lucky as us,

82
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:48,140
            who need families.

83
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:51,810
          Exactly.

84
00:06:51,812 --> 00:06:52,978
         And I've always wanted
         a big family.

85
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:09,895
Oh, crud.

86
00:07:09,897 --> 00:07:12,097
            What?

87
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:13,565
      It's an automated message
      from Arcadia.

88
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:15,734
            Uh, I can't listen.

89
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,543
    <i> This is Melanie Matthews</i>
    <i> from Arcadia Prep</i>
    <i> Dean's Office.</i>

90
00:07:24,545 --> 00:07:26,845
     <i> Although Jules' grades</i>
     <i> were top-notch</i>

91
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:29,648
       <i> and her test scores</i>
       <i> were excellent,</i>

92
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:32,217
   <i> there were a record number</i>
   <i> of applications this year.</i>

93
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:34,786
     <i> And ultimately,</i>
     <i> due to capacity issues,</i>

94
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,688
     <i> we could not make Jules</i>
     <i> part of Arcadia Prep.</i>

95
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:44,062
<i> And I see</i>
        <i> the workers fill</i>
        <i> those buildings.</i>

96
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:47,632
      <i> These guys are going</i>
      <i> to get our economy</i>
      <i> moving again</i>

97
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:50,535
      <i> with their innovation</i>
      <i> and productivity.</i>

98
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:52,003
        <i> There is a bright</i>
        <i> future ahead.</i>

101
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:14,826
That's a beautiful one.

104
00:08:50,264 --> 00:08:54,766
     <i> The experience is akin</i>

107
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:04,576
     Would that this process
     were more painless.

108
00:09:04,578 --> 00:09:06,211
  Let's review Gwen's old test.

109
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:14,152
     It'll remind us of what
     we're looking for.

110
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:16,154
   Do they know it could take
   a year to find someone
   as uniquely qualified?

111
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:19,558
    Gwen Koh's test, please.

112
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:23,828
<i> Username, please.</i>

113
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,831
 Isa Cryer, damn it! We've been
 here all afternoon.

114
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:32,671
   <i> In fact, the decisions</i>
   <i> we make in life define us.</i>

115
00:09:32,673 --> 00:09:36,675
   <i> So, shouldn't every woman</i>
   <i> be defined by the totality</i>
   <i> of her choices?</i>

116
00:09:36,677 --> 00:09:39,945
         <i> Rather than her race,</i>
         <i> height or health?</i>

117
00:09:39,947 --> 00:09:43,315
   <i> These are things she often</i>
   <i> cannot control.</i>

118
00:09:43,317 --> 00:09:46,851
   <i> Here at the Center for</i>

122
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:14,212
         I'm sorry, Mr. Fisher.

123
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:16,214

00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:27,025
 <i> Yes. You know, we've just</i>
  <i> been talking about that.</i>

128
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,662
                 You were?

129
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:34,232
 <i> Marketing just submitted</i>
 <i> a report showing</i>

00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,344

00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:07,065
 <i> They've started to search.</i>

137

138
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,138
 <i> Gwen, I did fight for you.</i>

              get into Arcadia.

144
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:35,727

 <i> the right people.</i>

 <i> Oh, well, with Eastern</i>
 <i> on her transcript,</i>
 <i> she'll have options.</i>

149
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:45,470
 <i> My daughters went there.</i>

150
00:11:45,472 --> 00:11:48,473
            I know, but tuition
            has doubled since
            your daughters.

151
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,177
       <i> Oh, okay.</i>

152
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:54,112
   <i> You're going to land</i>
   <i> on your feet.</i>

153
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:55,447
      <i> You have to.</i>

154
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:33,284
      Upstairs woman
      or downstairs woman?

155
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:52,403
          Both.

156
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:10,522
Why aren't you
      at school?

157
00:13:10,524 --> 00:13:12,490
        Conservation day.
        Are you going to Paris?

158
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:15,527
 Mmm-mmm. I have a short day
 too, so I could meet
 you after piano.

159
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:16,528
        Did you have your first
        taste of the day?

160
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:19,531
<i> Incoming call.</i>

161
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:22,066
          Hello, this is Gwen.

162
00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:24,135
<i> Hello, Gwen.</i>
 <i> This is Drake with Dream No</i>
 <i> More outplacement network.</i>

163
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,403
      Oh, hello, Drake.

164
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:27,539
  Uh, just one second,
  please.

165
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:29,874
<i> Sure.</i>
 I have to go.
 Are you set for today?

166
00:13:29,876 --> 00:13:31,476
   Uh, what should we
   tell Amanda's mom?

167
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:33,444
                      About?
 The Eastern luncheon.

168
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:36,481
     Tell her I'll be there.
     Get more details.

169
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:40,185
        So I can go to Eastern?

170
00:13:40,187 --> 00:13:41,519
    I got a call yesterday...
             About the raise?

171
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,090
         Yes, about the raise.

172
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,499
<i> Gwen, I called</i>
     <i> to let you know,</i>
     <i> that your information</i>

173
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,534
 <i> as of 3:30 a.m. this morning,</i>

174
00:13:56,536 --> 00:13:58,903
      <i> is in our system and</i>
      <i> you're good to go.</i>

175
00:13:58,905 --> 00:13:59,904
                   I'm actually
                   on my way in
                    to see you.

176
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:02,941
              <i> Why?</i>

177
00:14:02,943 --> 00:14:05,210
      Well, don't you have
      a speech to give me and
      then we sit down together

178
00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:07,412
            and focus on
            the new days ahead?

179
00:14:07,414 --> 00:14:09,848
      <i> Sounds good,</i>
      <i> but you're already</i>
      <i> a noted professional.</i>

180
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,250
Thank you.

181
00:14:12,252 --> 00:14:13,618
   <i> I'll be in touch the moment</i>
   <i> we get a response.</i>

182
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:15,920
         Great.

183
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:26,097
<i> There's one space you</i>
    <i> could fill right away.</i>

184
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:28,399
               I'm sorry. Yes?

185
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:31,502
     <i> Your recent physical</i>
     <i> pre-qualifies you to be</i>
     <i> a paid egg donor.</i>

186
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:36,040
             An egg donor?

187
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,376
  <i> It could offset living costs</i>
  <i> until we find you something</i>
  <i> more permanent.</i>

188
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:43,147
    <i> Many women are not able</i>
    <i> to have children anymore.</i>

189
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:46,317
  <i> And due to the great demand,</i>
  <i> the donor age threshold</i>
  <i> has risen.</i>

190
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,491
           <i> Miss Koh?</i>

191
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:54,492
          How long does
          the process take?

192
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:57,228
         <i> Three months.</i>

193
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,564
       <i> You'll be paid</i>
       <i> after the harvest.</i>

194
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:03,334
 That's not soon enough.
 Can we just focus on the jobs
 that I've outlined on my form?

195
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:04,402
           <i> Certainly.</i>

196
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,337
     Take what you can get.

197
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:08,907
         <i> Have a lovely day,</i>
         <i> Miss Koh.</i>

198
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:18,516
               Are you okay?

199
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,319
         Are you?

200
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,143
<i> Username, please.</i>

201
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,578
Gwen Koh.

202
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,046
<i> That entity does</i>
   <i> not exist.</i>

203
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:24,449
       <i> Please try again.</i>
          Gwen Koh.

204
00:16:24,451 --> 00:16:26,517
  <i> That entity does not exist.</i>

205
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,019
<i> Hello Gwen.</i>

206
00:16:28,021 --> 00:16:29,053
            Evan, my ID's
            not scanning.

207
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:31,689
     <i> What can I do for you?</i>

208
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:34,659
       Is Dave Fisher in?

209
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:37,395
    <i> He's offsite at the lab.</i>

210
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:38,496
       <i> Is that wardrobe?</i>

211
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:40,698
              Yes.

212
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:43,735
          <i> Please hold.</i>
           Thank you.

213
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:03,554
       Closer.

214
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,233
             Closer.

215
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:25,343
I found a solution
     to our problem, Fisher.

216
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:33,751
         I'm sorry.
         I'm a bit surprised.

217
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:35,219
           I've rarely seen you
           over the years.

218
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:37,755
   The dungeon's
   being renovated.

219
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:43,227
Yours too?

220
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:47,732
  How's the job search?

221
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,634
   Well, there's been interest
   in the past. So...

222
00:17:49,636 --> 00:17:51,069
I'm not worried.

223
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:53,571
     You've been pursued?

224
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,673
 By companies at our level?

225
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,846
 Well, I'm hardly surprised.

226
00:18:01,848 --> 00:18:04,148
    People connect to you.

227
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,250
  The question that we have
  to answer is in this current
  job market,

228
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:09,620
   with shifting desirability
   targets, can they get ahead
   looking like you?

229
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:12,757
   And at your age?

230
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,725
  My position here wasn't only
  about being a face.

231
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:18,563
            And the knowledge
            I've acquired here,

232
00:18:18,565 --> 00:18:20,565
          I can carry
          into other positions.

233
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:21,632
        Teaching, for instance.

234
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:22,767
    You've taught before?

235
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:24,635
                In grad school.

236
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:27,638
       In grad school?

237
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,507
  Well, even in the real world,

238
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:32,176
 you won't make close to what
 you were making here.

239
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:34,178
 The education profession has
 gone pure tech.

240
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:37,315
 There is nothing in our
 generation's skill pool
 that can compete.

241
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:41,819
  Well, there must be something

242
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:44,422
    in a mere human existence
    that has value.

243
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,459
 You and I, in our lifetimes,
 will see progress

244
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,796
 1,000 times greater
 than the previous century.

245
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,297
   But, because we're
   mere humans,

246
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,233
     we won't be able
     to comprehend it.

247
00:18:55,235 --> 00:18:57,568
 Humans can only grasp
 change at a rate they've
 experienced it.

248
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:02,406
     <i> Which is why they</i>
     <i> are being left behind.</i>

249
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:09,714
 How is your daughter?

250
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:13,851
 I understand she's quite
 a talent.

251
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,656
           She keeps me alive.

252
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:20,791
As do my girls.

253
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:26,697
   There is nothing fiercer
   than a mother's love.

254
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:37,909
Hello, Drake.

255
00:19:37,911 --> 00:19:39,277
<i> Hey, Claire.</i>

256
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:41,879
    Uh, no. This is Gwen Koh.

257
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:42,947
          <i> Hello, Gwen.</i>

258
00:19:42,949 --> 00:19:44,549
         I see here
         you just called me.

259
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:47,818
             Drake?

260
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,520
           <i> Yes, Gwen.</i>

261
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,255
      Have you heard something?
      Do I have an interview?

262
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:55,493
   <i> There's been some activity</i>
   <i> on your account.</i>

263
00:19:55,495 --> 00:19:57,428
       <i> You've received</i>
       <i> several inquiries.</i>

264
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:00,431
  <i> And one counter endorsement.</i>

265
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:02,233
          Counter endorsement?

266
00:20:02,235 --> 00:20:04,669
  <i> A flag has been raised about</i>
  <i> a detail on your resume.</i>

267
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:10,575
      <i> It is currently</i>
      <i> under investigation.</i>

268
00:20:10,577 --> 00:20:12,843
      It's a mistake.
      I have verifications
      for everything.

269
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:21,419
  Drake, can I ask who's filed
  this counter endorsement?

270
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:25,289
 <i> Huh, would you like me to tell</i>
 <i> you my astrological sign too?</i>

271
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:26,524
           I'm sorry?

272
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:30,428
         <i> Are you sorry?</i>

273
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:37,301
         Drake, are you
         a human being?

274
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:41,272
    <i> That's a funny question.</i>
    <i> How do you define</i>
    <i> a human being?</i>

275
00:20:41,274 --> 00:20:43,007
    Do you have blood running
    through your veins?

276
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,813
      <i> That is a definition</i>
      <i> of a human being?</i>

277
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:58,022
     I didn't know.

278
00:20:58,024 --> 00:20:59,857
      <i> That sounds more like</i>
      <i> a human being.</i>

279
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:01,425
          <i> Not to know.</i>

280
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:09,700

              How long will you
              be staying today?

287
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:36,894
 How much is it again?

288
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:39,864
                  Alone?

289
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:42,967
          Did you need company?

290
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:45,569
     No.

291
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:08,953
 Did you hear me?
  I was terrible.

292
00:23:08,955 --> 00:23:10,020
               No, you weren't,
                where's Ginger?

293
00:23:10,022 --> 00:23:12,423
  I told her
  not to come over.

294
00:23:12,425 --> 00:23:15,126
  Holoprof was trying to finish
  the 20th and 21st centuries
  in one class period.

295
00:23:15,128 --> 00:23:17,428
    All I remember is
    the 2033 bubble

296
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:20,498
 and the New York
 traditionalist movement, which
 he said is taking over now.

297
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,966
 Which I challenged.

298
00:23:21,968 --> 00:23:24,535
 Are women really going
 backwards going forward?

299
00:23:24,537 --> 00:23:25,403
       You're not.

300
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:29,039
             Let's get you
             something to eat.

301
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,618
       Uh, she's not open.

302
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:57,067
 I don't know why I'm alive.

303
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,808
          That's a bit extreme.

304
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:04,942
   What happened with Ginger?

305
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:05,810
 There's so much to do.

306
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:10,114
 I need to exercise more,
 study more,

307
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:12,750
    I need to do more
    volunteer work
    in art.

308
00:24:12,752 --> 00:24:15,920
 I need to be smarter, nicer,
 prettier and classier.

309
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:19,089
 But what's the point?

310
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:21,992
                 Many reasons.
           Like?

311
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,095
                         Music.

312
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:32,169
            Being loved by your
            amazing mother.

313
00:24:32,171 --> 00:24:34,071
 None of you know
 what you're doing.

314
00:24:34,073 --> 00:24:36,507
You all pretend
 to have a plan for us,

315
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:40,010
 but everyone's just
 either greedy or desperate.

316
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:45,149
 Why did you have me?

317
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:47,585
 When you knew the world was
 so bad and you had
 to struggle so much.

318
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:52,022
 You're all alone
 with no one to help you.

319
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:56,894
          There was a time when
          I was also confused
          why I was alive.

320
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:01,932
          And I guess something
          in me thought that...

321
00:25:07,105 --> 00:25:08,172
           I mean,
           I thought having you

322
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:11,809
   might make my life more...

323
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:14,979
      Worthwhile?

324
00:25:19,117 --> 00:25:20,918
        You make me very happy.

325
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:50,915
<i> Archived message.</i>

326
00:25:50,917 --> 00:25:54,251

     <i> I'm at the restaurant.</i>

    <i> I still worry about you.</i>

  <i> It must be really hard to be</i>

<i> Tomorrow's events.</i>

    <i> to send a response?</i>

336
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:34,992
<i> For our next hour,</i>

337
00:26:34,994 --> 00:26:39,129
 <i> we'll be discussing the recent</i>

338

  <i> Its causes, symptoms and...</i>

339
00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:43,233
 One week of water left.

340

<i> A report</i>
      <i> last week from</i>
      <i> the Department of...</i>

341
00:26:44,737 --> 00:26:47,137

344
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:12,396
 Where did you
 get this recipe?

345
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:17,668
               My cousin Lily.

346
00:27:19,671 --> 00:27:20,804
 Lily from the picture?

347
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,276
             Yup. She taught me
             when I had to work
             at her restaurant.

348
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,804
Gwen Koh.

349
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:02,112
           How wonderful you
           could join us.

350
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:04,848
           Oh!

351
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:10,187
    My Amanda has told me so
    much about you and Jules.

352
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:15,025
   Gwen is the head of the
   Center for Advanced Health
   and Living.

353
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:18,729
        One of the most forward
        thinking companies
        in our midst.

354
00:28:18,731 --> 00:28:21,198
   About to reveal the biotech
   bubble of the moment.

355
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,067
       You're a scientist?

356
00:28:23,069 --> 00:28:25,736
      Oh, not exactly.

357
00:28:25,738 --> 00:28:29,273
  Olivia's intrigued by any
  woman making her way through
  the job climate today.

358
00:28:29,275 --> 00:28:31,108
  Especially with the backlash
  we're experiencing.

359
00:28:36,115 --> 00:28:37,047
I'm sorry.

360
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:49,259
   We would have moved forward
   a while ago,

361
00:28:49,261 --> 00:28:51,261
    but her father has clout.

362
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:55,966
     We do what is best for
     our children.

363
00:28:57,368 --> 00:28:58,435
             We do.

364
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:02,306
          We studied Jules' CV,

365
00:29:02,308 --> 00:29:05,409
  it's clear your agenda for
  your daughter is
  as your career, unstoppable.

366
00:29:07,378 --> 00:29:09,513
    Gwen, the mission of our
    bonding camp is hundreds
    of years old

367
00:29:09,515 --> 00:29:12,249
       and 100 years
       into the future.

368
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:17,054
 We comingle the finest boys
 and girls, in advance of their
 prep school experience.

369
00:29:17,056 --> 00:29:20,357
      Have them introduce their
      innate talents and dreams
      to one another.

370
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:23,927
  To create a culture that will
  cohesify them through their
  years together in school.

371
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:26,163
     In our world's history,
     even when resources
     were limited,

372
00:29:26,165 --> 00:29:28,432
    there's always been room
    for an elite.

373
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:30,300
    As there's less room now,

374
00:29:30,302 --> 00:29:33,837
    we're putting our brains
    and our pocketbooks
    where it counts.

375
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:38,942
        This all sounds good.

376
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:41,879
              Good?

377
00:29:41,881 --> 00:29:42,980
             Ideal.

378
00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:45,849
        I'm just wondering...

379
00:29:45,851 --> 00:29:48,552
    We've put in 30K each,
    we would ask you for 10,

380
00:29:48,554 --> 00:29:50,154
    to hold the waitlist spot
    for Jules.

381
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:53,991
            I might need
            a day or two.

382
00:29:53,993 --> 00:29:55,959
         Loosen up
         Jules' father.

383
00:29:57,963 --> 00:29:59,263
         He's not a part
         of our lives.

384
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:04,334
     And isn't going to be?

385
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:08,939
      Not even Jules' life?

386
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:19,116
      That is a wild card.

387
00:30:26,391 --> 00:30:27,457
          Hello, dear.

388
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,535
 This is the only time
 in your daughter's life

389
00:30:38,537 --> 00:30:40,470
     when her choices
     will make a difference.

390
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:45,509
   Take the help you can get.

391
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:11,268
<i> Gwen, look at us.</i>

392
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:13,503
     <i> We're talking again</i>
     <i> after all these years.</i>

393
00:31:13,505 --> 00:31:16,240
        <i> What a blessing.</i>

394
00:31:16,242 --> 00:31:19,543
 <i> So let's do this right, okay,</i>
  <i> and learn from our mistakes?</i>

395
00:31:19,545 --> 00:31:21,979
      <i> I'm truly sorry</i>
      <i> for leaving you alone</i>
      <i> with Jules</i>

396
00:31:21,981 --> 00:31:23,146
  <i> and turning my back on you.</i>

397
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,451
     Mom, thank you
     for saying that, but...

398
00:31:29,153 --> 00:31:31,955
    I have to get something
    together, now. Or else...

399
00:31:31,957 --> 00:31:34,124
     <i> Or else you'll continue</i>
     <i> to suffer, I know.</i>

400
00:31:34,126 --> 00:31:34,992
       <i> And so will Jules.</i>

401
00:31:37,962 --> 00:31:38,896
       <i> So, how much money</i>
       <i> do you need?</i>

402
00:31:41,533 --> 00:31:43,500
 $40,000 would get us
 through the next month.

403
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:48,205
<i> $40,000?</i>

404
00:31:48,207 --> 00:31:49,940
 Access costs money, Mom.
 You know that.

405
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:53,944
        <i> So, who does she</i>
        <i> look like now?</i>

406
00:31:55,446 --> 00:31:56,313
     She looks like herself.

407
00:31:58,616 --> 00:32:01,184
      <i> Well, send me</i>
      <i> some pictures, okay?</i>

408
00:32:01,186 --> 00:32:02,486
   <i> You know, it doesn't matter</i>
   <i> who she looks like.</i>

409
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:13,697
      <i> Your father thinks</i>
      <i> about you, you know?</i>

410
00:32:13,699 --> 00:32:15,265
      <i> He talked about you</i>
      <i> in his sermon today.</i>

411
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:16,333
 Mom, don't.

412
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:29,179
        <i> Okay, uh,</i>
        <i> let me call Dad.</i>

413
00:32:29,181 --> 00:32:30,347
               No!

414
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:34,584
 <i> If I don't ask your father...</i>

415
00:32:34,586 --> 00:32:35,652
 He's not ever going to meet
 my daughter, Mom.

416
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:38,555
      I will die
      before that happens.

417
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,391
             <i> Gwen.</i>

418
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:47,464
         <i> He's changed.</i>

419
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,566
     <i> God has forgiven him.</i>

420
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,471
        <i> Your father says</i>
       <i> I can't help you.</i>

421
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:56,440
    Aren't you still working?

422
00:32:56,442 --> 00:32:58,608
      <i> Let's pray</i>
      <i> for your forgiveness.</i>

423
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:00,510
<i> Remember,</i>
  <i> you used to love to pray?</i>

424
00:33:00,512 --> 00:33:01,378
        I...
           <i> Dear Lord,</i>

425
00:33:02,513 --> 00:33:05,482
      <i> please listen to us.</i>

426
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:08,185
  <i> At this time, we're ready for</i>
  <i> you to take away...</i>
 I'm hanging up now.

427
00:33:08,187 --> 00:33:10,187
       <i> ...this sin that</i>
       <i> Gwen has committed.</i>

428
00:33:10,189 --> 00:33:12,055
   Goodbye.
   <i> Thank you for your infinite</i>
   <i> patience, dear Lord.</i>

429
00:33:12,057 --> 00:33:14,324
        I love you, Mama.

430
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:15,292
    <i> And your infinite mercy</i>
    <i> that you have shown Gwen.</i>
    Goodbye. End call.

431
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,764
<i> Please look down</i>
   <i> on her now with love</i>

432
00:33:20,766 --> 00:33:22,165
   <i> and heal her of this sin.</i>

433
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:27,637
       <i> Help her to start</i>
       <i> a brand new life.</i>

434
00:33:27,639 --> 00:33:29,539
   <i> A brand new life with you</i>
   <i> at the center of her heart.</i>

435
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,610
         <i> And please...</i>

436
00:33:33,612 --> 00:33:36,046
   <i> Please watch out for Jules</i>

437
00:33:36,048 --> 00:33:37,647
      <i> and wrap her</i>
      <i> in your loving care,</i>
      <i> dear Lord.</i>

438
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,501
   <i> Sorry, how've you been?</i>

439
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:01,505
               Am I too old?

440
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:03,440
                To be of use?

441
00:34:06,644 --> 00:34:07,511
 <i> What're you talking about,</i>
 <i> Gwen?</i>

442
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:10,747
              <i> So many women</i>
              <i> are out of work.</i>

443
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:14,818
   <i> Some are in real trouble.</i>

444
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:17,421
 <i> To be frank, there is talk</i>
 <i> among recruiters about</i>

445
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,323
    <i> letting women</i>
    <i> stay unemployed and,</i>

446
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:24,628
 <i> well, return to the home.</i>

447
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:27,697
  <i> The perception is it's safer</i>
  <i> than putting millions of</i>
  <i> desperate men on the street.</i>

448
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,735
             Safer? For whom?

449
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:34,071
          <i> Everyone.</i>

450
00:34:37,141 --> 00:34:38,141
         Make me
         the younger candidate.

451
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:41,344
        <i> I'm sorry?</i>

452
00:34:41,346 --> 00:34:42,212
            The procedure
            you're launching...

453
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:45,449
               Use it on me.

454
00:34:45,451 --> 00:34:46,316
               Put me into
               a younger body.

455
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,521
   <i> We haven't had any civilian</i>
   <i> test subjects yet.</i>

456
00:34:51,523 --> 00:34:53,557
          I want to be the face
          of the Center again.

457
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:54,658
         I've done all
         the prep work already.

458
00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:57,761
          I'd be both
          an expert and a user.

459
00:34:58,596 --> 00:34:59,729
       Your ideal spokesperson.

460
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:04,668
          I'm the best there is
          at this job.

461
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:11,775
          Can I talk
          about this later?

462
00:35:11,777 --> 00:35:13,310
        I really need
        to do this later.

463
00:35:13,312 --> 00:35:14,778
      I can't get an interview,
      Dave, not one.

464
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,645
   <i> I really have to go.</i>

465
00:35:17,515 --> 00:35:20,684
           I have to
           position Jules now.

466
00:35:20,686 --> 00:35:23,420
         <i> If I can get her</i>
         <i> into a good school,</i>
         <i> she'll have a chance.</i>

467
00:35:23,422 --> 00:35:24,855
         I can't let her become
         one of these women,

468
00:35:24,857 --> 00:35:26,356
  so desperate
  that they would do anything.

469
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,194
                       Dave,

470
00:35:31,196 --> 00:35:32,829
          you would do the same
          for your own girls,

471
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:35,332
       if you were in my place.

472
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:47,244
 <i> Marketing has a specific</i>
 <i> physical type in mind.</i>

473
00:35:47,246 --> 00:35:49,846
  <i> They're looking at candidates</i>
  <i> that come off</i>
  <i> as a touch more universal.</i>

474
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:54,718
 <i> So if I could tell them</i>
 <i> that you'd be willing to</i>

475
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,621
     <i> give them full control</i>
     <i> over the creation</i>
     <i> of your host body,</i>

476
00:35:57,623 --> 00:35:58,822
 that might show them
 how much you care about

477
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:01,691
 the product's success.

478
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:12,869
         <i> Okay.</i>

479
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:16,373
You'd be willing
 to do that?

480
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:21,778
           The point is to push
            the product, right?

481
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:24,681
     <i> When isn't it?</i>

482
00:36:27,251 --> 00:36:27,918
 I'll talk to them.

483
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,487
                 <i> Thank you.</i>

484
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:35,625
Evan?

485
00:36:35,627 --> 00:36:36,960
<i> Yes, Miss Cryer.</i>

486
00:36:36,962 --> 00:36:39,196
         Make replications
         of Fisher's last call.

487
00:36:39,198 --> 00:36:40,664
          CC the Board.

488
00:36:40,666 --> 00:36:41,531
<i> Working on it.</i>

489
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:52,976
Couldn't say this
        on the record,

490
00:36:52,978 --> 00:36:55,512
  but most of our test subjects
  develop breathing issues.

491
00:36:57,415 --> 00:36:59,749
   They have to get a shot
   every two hours for a year.

492
00:37:01,686 --> 00:37:02,719
        There's recurring pain.

493
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:06,223
 I'll deal with it.

494
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:11,995
 Evan, what's wrong
  with our filters?

495
00:37:11,997 --> 00:37:13,863
 I can barely
 understand them.

496
00:37:13,865 --> 00:37:14,764
<i> There's an error.</i>

497
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,566
         <i> Working on it.</i>

498
00:37:21,439 --> 00:37:23,273
  The board was expecting
 you'd offer yourself up.

499
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:26,743
 You're the
 logical next step.

500
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,715
 After this, the board'll wanna
 protect their show piece,

501
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:35,952
 Jules'll get what she needs.

502
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:41,258
 Are you ready to
 explain all this to her?

503
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,759
         I've been trying
         not to think about it.

504
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:43,827
 Well, think about it.

505
00:37:54,805 --> 00:37:56,406
 This might be
 a bigger sacrifice
 than you imagine.

506
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:00,310
 Gwen, it's not like
 you're a consciousness
 in a jar

507
00:38:00,312 --> 00:38:02,746
 that we're dumping
  into another jar.

508
00:38:02,748 --> 00:38:03,813
 The technology
 is not there yet.

509
00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:06,683
       What's the reality then?

510
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:16,626
<i> It's the location.</i>
 <i> I don't think there is a fix.</i>

511
00:38:18,529 --> 00:38:20,764
What're you trying
 to hide from me, Fisher?

512
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:26,870
 Please don't do this.

513
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:34,644
  But this is still Jules'
  only chance though, isn't it?

514
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:42,052
         You know it is.
         You just won't say it.

515
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,023
           I'm not going to get
           another job.

516
00:38:48,726 --> 00:38:49,959
       They'll make sure of it.

517
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:56,800
                    I want

518
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:01,371
      Christmas with her first.

519
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:36,199
What's wrong?

520
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:40,003
          Nothing.

521
00:40:40,005 --> 00:40:41,671
  I was thinking about dinner.

522
00:42:31,315 --> 00:42:33,783
If I had to go away,

523
00:42:33,785 --> 00:42:36,219
  you'd be able to take care
  of things here, right?

524
00:42:36,221 --> 00:42:37,086
 You'd do okay without me.

525
00:42:39,857 --> 00:42:41,658
I guess so.
             How long?

526
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:46,729
       I don't know.
       A while.

527
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:47,931
A while sounds too long.

528
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:06,149
           I hope you think
           you're pretty.

529
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:11,788
       Sometimes.

530
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:14,057
        If someone asked you
        to change something
        about the way you look,

531
00:43:15,292 --> 00:43:16,159
             what would it be?

532
00:43:20,698 --> 00:43:23,333
     My nose skinnier,
     my shins longer,
     my jumps higher.

533
00:43:23,335 --> 00:43:24,200
  We did this in class.

534
00:43:28,706 --> 00:43:31,040
 And what would you change
 about me?

535
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:33,276
                    Nothing.

536
00:43:37,081 --> 00:43:40,650
 We're going through
 a shift at work.

537
00:43:40,652 --> 00:43:41,317
   It comes along
   with my raise.

538
00:43:43,754 --> 00:43:44,621
            What kind of shift?

539
00:43:46,023 --> 00:43:47,757
 In my appearance.

540
00:43:47,759 --> 00:43:49,292
 They want to appeal
 to younger audiences.

541
00:43:53,897 --> 00:43:54,831
      I guess that makes sense.

542
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:57,166
            It's good that
            they'll pay for it.

543
00:44:15,753 --> 00:44:16,419
They're here.

544
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:43,746
       Goodbye, Miss Koh.

545
00:44:57,294 --> 00:45:00,129
<i> Hi, Mom.</i>

546
00:45:00,131 --> 00:45:04,167
      <i> Everyone's calling</i>
      <i> their families before</i>
      <i> we go tech-free.</i>

547
00:45:04,169 --> 00:45:06,469
   <i> But you can still reach me</i>
   <i> through the camp office</i>
   <i> if you need me.</i>

548
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:10,473
 <i> It's super beautiful out here.</i>

549
00:45:11,475 --> 00:45:12,341
         <i> Really quiet.</i>

550
00:45:14,011 --> 00:45:15,278
      <i> I think I just heard</i>
      <i> myself blink.</i>

551
00:45:17,114 --> 00:45:17,947
          <i> I love you.</i>

552
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:22,051
       <i> I hope you're not</i>
       <i> working too hard.</i>

553
00:45:23,854 --> 00:45:26,055
  <i> You should go out</i>
  <i> and celebrate your big raise.</i>

554
00:45:32,963 --> 00:45:33,830
<i> New message.</i>

555
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:37,066
<i> Hi.</i>

556
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:38,101
       <i> It's Lily, again.</i>

557
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:44,807
        <i> I hope you got</i>
        <i> my last message.</i>

558
00:45:44,809 --> 00:45:46,008
      <i> I wanted to wish you</i>
      <i> a happy birthday.</i>

559
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:50,313
   <i> You know where to find us.</i>

560
00:47:26,977 --> 00:47:28,311
 I remembered the code.

561
00:47:29,246 --> 00:47:30,112
 All three of our birthdays.

562
00:47:34,618 --> 00:47:35,484
           We never changed it.

563
00:47:41,091 --> 00:47:41,958
      Just one minute.

564
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:55,037
  Is Lily out there?

565
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:57,273
          You need to call us
          first and say exactly
          why you wanna see us.

566
00:47:59,043 --> 00:48:01,143
Han!

567
00:48:01,145 --> 00:48:02,578
   Okay, we're not putting her
   through this. Please.

568
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:05,548
                    Hey.

569
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,417
            I'm sorry, okay?

570
00:48:08,419 --> 00:48:09,418
           I didn't know that.
           Okay, I'm coming.

571
00:48:13,523 --> 00:48:15,191
   Okay, she's had a long day.

572
00:48:15,193 --> 00:48:16,058
          It's not
          a good time for this.

573
00:48:17,127 --> 00:48:18,895
 I need to...
                  Please.

574
00:48:18,897 --> 00:48:20,463
      Go. Please don't do this.

575
00:48:23,667 --> 00:48:24,533
              I am begging you.

576
00:48:49,626 --> 00:48:51,260
 You need to stop watching
 those crime shows.

577
00:48:53,196 --> 00:48:55,031
 What's the matter?
                     Nothing.

578
00:48:55,033 --> 00:48:57,333
           Where are the boys?
 They're waiting for you
 in the car.

579
00:48:57,335 --> 00:48:59,702
 You're taking them
 to practice, right?
                        Yeah.

580
00:48:59,704 --> 00:49:01,504
   Thank you, honey.

581
00:49:01,506 --> 00:49:02,638
 I'll go pick up menus
 for dinner.

582
00:49:09,212 --> 00:49:10,546
        I have to see her now.

583
00:49:10,548 --> 00:49:12,581
               Lily! Lily!

584
00:49:19,589 --> 00:49:21,524
Well, this is
 a nice surprise.

585
00:49:21,526 --> 00:49:22,692
       But we're about
       to open for dinner.

586
00:49:24,394 --> 00:49:25,461
           No.

587
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:27,663
      We have time.

588
00:49:28,732 --> 00:49:29,565
     It's fine.

589
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:32,601
 Go get the boys.

590
00:49:33,603 --> 00:49:34,670
 You should meet.

591
00:49:37,074 --> 00:49:38,207
       Lily, do you remember...

592
00:49:38,209 --> 00:49:39,108
            Gwen, we're
            really busy today.

593
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:45,247
           You know, don't you?

594
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:50,987
          Yes.

595
00:49:52,356 --> 00:49:53,222
 Han told me.

596
00:49:56,693 --> 00:49:57,560
 It was a long time ago.

597
00:50:00,263 --> 00:50:01,297
             I had a child.

598
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:05,034
            When?

599
00:50:08,472 --> 00:50:09,572
                  We...

600
00:50:11,308 --> 00:50:12,375
              Had a child.

601
00:50:15,045 --> 00:50:16,178
That's not possible.

602
00:50:17,381 --> 00:50:18,614
 She was seeing other guys.

603
00:50:18,616 --> 00:50:19,682
          I lied about that.

604
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:27,456
     Well, then you're lying
     about this.

605
00:50:28,759 --> 00:50:30,493
- No. Her name is Jules.
- No.

606
00:50:30,495 --> 00:50:31,360
- She just turned 13.
- No. No.

607
00:50:34,564 --> 00:50:35,731
  You can't do it this way.

608
00:50:39,803 --> 00:50:41,270
           And so I stayed away
            as long as I could,

609
00:50:41,272 --> 00:50:42,805
   because I didn't want to do
   any more damage.

610
00:50:45,175 --> 00:50:47,576
   The only reason I'm here
   is to ask that you consider
   helping me,

611
00:50:47,578 --> 00:50:49,612
        helping your daughter,
        and then we'll be gone.

612
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:54,717
The boys are
          still in the car.

613
00:50:56,119 --> 00:50:57,453
       Han!
       Am I taking them or not?

614
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:13,102
 You know, you never believed
 I was there for you.

615
00:51:14,204 --> 00:51:15,071
 Even when we were little.

616
00:51:16,473 --> 00:51:17,573
              Why would you
              be there for me?

617
00:51:18,675 --> 00:51:20,176
   I slept with your husband.

618
00:51:20,178 --> 00:51:21,210
 And he slept with you.

619
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:28,350
 You must feel so lonely.

620
00:51:36,626 --> 00:51:38,527
   I just need help for a year

621
00:51:38,529 --> 00:51:40,463
            or six months,
            and I can even
            pay you interest.

622
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:45,701
             You won't even
             have to see us.

623
00:51:47,737 --> 00:51:50,739
            You can move on
            and be the same
            as you were before.

624
00:51:56,346 --> 00:51:57,213
 Why do you do this?

625
00:52:00,817 --> 00:52:03,719
 Why do you continually
 go into things
 that will be a disaster?

626
00:52:07,724 --> 00:52:11,160
  I've been trying to get you
 to help me heal this family.

627
00:52:11,162 --> 00:52:14,230
 And when you finally
 show up, you just bring
 more pain.

628
00:52:19,603 --> 00:52:20,836
              That's what I do.

629
00:52:25,543 --> 00:52:27,710
The parking lot's filling up.
  We need to open now.
Okay.

630
00:52:28,411 --> 00:52:29,478
     Hey, you.

631
00:52:34,918 --> 00:52:36,218
   I can't talk about this
   anymore right now.

632
00:52:41,391 --> 00:52:44,426
            I wish I had time.
            But I don't.

633
00:52:44,428 --> 00:52:45,494
      We need time.

634
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:47,630
    This is a lot.

635
00:52:47,632 --> 00:52:48,697
     Shh, it's okay.

636
00:52:51,535 --> 00:52:53,169
  Aren't we going to practice?

637
00:52:53,171 --> 00:52:54,170
       As soon as we open
       the restaurant, sweetie.

638
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:00,876
                 Please.

639
00:53:02,646 --> 00:53:03,712
    We have kids too.

640
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:16,892
      I know you've always
      been there for me.

641
00:53:19,396 --> 00:53:20,262
               I know.

642
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:48,317
<i> We did sitting</i>
      <i> meditation too.</i>

643
00:54:49,719 --> 00:54:50,786
     <i> But it wasn't as fun.</i>

644
00:54:53,323 --> 00:54:56,992
    <i> Sometimes</i>
    <i> if things got loud or...</i>

645
00:54:56,994 --> 00:54:58,894
    <i> I couldn't go to my room</i>
    <i> I would do the spinning.</i>

646
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:02,898
  <i> I felt energetic afterwards.</i>

647
00:55:04,534 --> 00:55:05,401
   <i> Like I could do anything.</i>

648
00:55:10,006 --> 00:55:11,573
         <i> I met a ton</i>
         <i> of fun people.</i>

649
00:55:12,742 --> 00:55:13,809
People.

650
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:16,879
             A boy?

651
00:55:19,449 --> 00:55:20,316
                   Both.

652
00:55:22,852 --> 00:55:23,919
            But I miss Ginger.

653
00:55:26,589 --> 00:55:27,656
Jules?

654
00:55:29,025 --> 00:55:30,059
 Do you remember
 what I said about

655
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:32,695
 having to make a change
 at work?

656
00:55:48,611 --> 00:55:50,012
 It'll be hard for me
 to take in oxygen at first,

657
00:55:52,449 --> 00:55:54,049
 which will affect
 the blood flow to my brain.

658
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,721
 You may have to
 remind me of things.

659
00:56:00,757 --> 00:56:02,391
       Especially
       what's important to you.

660
00:56:06,563 --> 00:56:07,429
         This is a big change.

661
00:56:10,433 --> 00:56:11,533
   No one will recognize you.

662
00:56:13,136 --> 00:56:14,470
 I'll have a special ID.

663
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:17,539
        And as more people
        get the procedure done,

664
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:21,844
              it'll feel easier
              to explain.

665
00:56:25,682 --> 00:56:26,548
She's pretty.

666
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:32,421
            Don't you think so?

667
00:56:40,663 --> 00:56:42,131
          Would you feel okay
          around her

668
00:56:43,099 --> 00:56:43,966
                first thing
                in the morning?

669
00:56:46,503 --> 00:56:47,169
              If you were sick?

670
00:56:48,838 --> 00:56:50,606
                 Imagine if she
                 got frustrated

671
00:56:50,608 --> 00:56:51,673
                  or even mad.

672
00:56:52,776 --> 00:56:53,842
         You keep saying "she."

673
00:56:55,845 --> 00:56:56,912
         It's still you, right?

674
00:57:00,683 --> 00:57:02,551
      I'm sorry.
      This whole thing is
      kind of weird for me too.

675
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:55,137
                  What is this?

676
00:58:05,014 --> 00:58:06,081
                    This is me?

677
00:58:16,693 --> 00:58:17,759
                You're amazing.

678
00:58:20,063 --> 00:58:22,164
 No, I'm not.
                 Yes, you are.

679
00:58:29,038 --> 00:58:30,105
  Listen to me.

680
00:58:32,041 --> 00:58:34,042
 It's good to be humble,

681
00:58:34,044 --> 00:58:35,077
           but you need
           to know your value.

682
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:39,781
 The ideas, the wisdom,

683
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:42,851
            and the kindness
            in you.

684
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:44,987
         That's the secret
         beauty everyone wants.

685
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:53,996
       Are you okay?

686
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:01,323
...live emotionally.

687
01:02:13,096 --> 01:02:15,163
 The Center's procedure

688
01:02:16,866 --> 01:02:19,034
provides a
 painless alternative

689
01:02:20,269 --> 01:02:23,071
  to invasive cosmetic surgery.

690
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:27,442
 We move you
 into another body
 and the lossless...

691
01:02:36,452 --> 01:02:38,353
The Center's procedure

692
01:02:38,355 --> 01:02:43,358
 provides a
 painless alternative to
 invasive cosmetic surgery.

693
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:59,074
<i> The experience is</i>
  <i> akin to a seamless jump into</i>
  <i> a brand new body,</i>

694
01:02:59,076 --> 01:03:04,146
   circumventing the extensive
   recovery period of invasive
   cosmetic surgery.

695
01:03:04,148 --> 01:03:07,883
            I can attest to
            the seamlessness
            of this experience,

696
01:03:07,885 --> 01:03:11,086
   not only as the head
   of the Center for
   Advanced Health and Living,

697
01:03:11,088 --> 01:03:14,156
        but also a very
        satisfied test subject.

698
01:03:26,536 --> 01:03:29,471
    Okay. So who
    out there thinks
    they have an imagination?

699
01:03:33,042 --> 01:03:34,276
                  Everyone?

700
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:41,082
<i> Okay, everyone.</i>
 <i> Close your eyes.</i>

701
01:03:41,084 --> 01:03:44,386
    <i> Imagine a world where you</i>
    <i> were diagnosed with</i>
    <i> a terminal illness,</i>

702
01:03:44,388 --> 01:03:47,389
 <i> but you live to see your</i>
 <i> great-grandkids go to college.</i>

703
01:03:50,293 --> 01:03:54,162
       <i> Now let's imagine</i>
        <i> living 48 years</i>
        <i> with a clubfoot.</i>

704
01:03:55,398 --> 01:03:58,366
   <i> But on your 50th birthday,</i>

705
01:03:58,368 --> 01:04:00,001
      <i> you're a professional</i>
      <i> ballet dancer.</i>

706
01:04:04,207 --> 01:04:05,207
          Now open your eyes.

707
01:04:10,213 --> 01:04:12,514
    <i> You don't have to dream</i>
     <i> up that world anymore.</i>

708
01:04:19,155 --> 01:04:20,388
          That world is here,

709
01:04:21,224 --> 01:04:22,591
           and it's yours.

710
01:04:27,330 --> 01:04:29,397
<i> New recorded</i>
     <i> hologram message.</i>

711
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:33,935
        <i> I was in shock.</i>

712
01:04:36,005 --> 01:04:37,405
     <i> I hope you understand.</i>

713
01:04:37,407 --> 01:04:39,975
     <i> The day you visited us</i>

714
01:04:39,977 --> 01:04:42,310
    <i> reminded me how much</i>
    <i> I hated who I used to be.</i>

715
01:04:45,214 --> 01:04:46,314
         <i> We wanna help.</i>

716
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:00,929
          <i> I miss you.</i>

717
01:05:39,268 --> 01:05:40,135
Did you forget your shot?

718
01:05:43,139 --> 01:05:44,005
                    Yeah.

719
01:05:45,374 --> 01:05:46,308
              I forgot my shot.

720
01:05:48,411 --> 01:05:49,477
 Sorry.

721
01:06:42,365 --> 01:06:43,698
 Don't come
 to meet me anymore.

722
01:06:45,267 --> 01:06:46,267
   Not until you feel better.

723
01:06:48,204 --> 01:06:49,037
        You think I'm an idiot.

724
01:06:51,574 --> 01:06:52,640
 It doesn't matter
 what I think of you.

725
01:07:39,688 --> 01:07:40,755
 Did the operation
 make you weird?

726
01:07:44,393 --> 01:07:47,195
 You seem weird.

727
01:07:47,197 --> 01:07:49,397
<i> The majority of</i>
      <i> people who are down</i>
      <i> on their luck</i>

01:07:58,809 --> 01:08:00,108
      <i> bombing and terror.</i>

01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:08,376
     Can you turn that off?

740
01:09:10,579 --> 01:09:11,646
        I thought you liked it.

741
01:09:12,581 --> 01:09:13,648
     Not right now.

742
01:09:28,531 --> 01:09:29,797
        Can you cheer up?

743
01:09:29,799 --> 01:09:32,500
                 What for?
   How about for your mother?

744
01:09:32,502 --> 01:09:35,436
 Because of me, you might
 actually get somewhere instead
 of dreaming your life away.

745
01:09:35,438 --> 01:09:36,304
              I'm not dreaming.

746
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:39,207
               I'm thinking.

747
01:09:47,449 --> 01:09:48,516
            Where's my mother?

748
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:52,954
 Get back to work.
               You're not her.

749
01:09:59,595 --> 01:10:00,795
                Where is she?

750
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:05,266
         What happened?

751
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:15,510
Get away.

752
01:10:38,467 --> 01:10:39,334
          Well, you were right.

753
01:10:40,302 --> 01:10:41,502
 About the pain not going away.

754
01:10:46,875 --> 01:10:47,909
      I feel this anger...

755
01:10:51,847 --> 01:10:52,914
                  Like

756
01:10:56,619 --> 01:10:58,620
  something is sitting next to
  me screaming all the time.

757
01:11:03,792 --> 01:11:05,960
 <i> It's what we're calling</i>
 <i> mnemonic dissonance.</i>

758
01:11:05,962 --> 01:11:08,963
 <i> It's your new body's</i>
 <i> instincts clashing</i>
 <i> with your old memories.</i>

759
01:11:08,965 --> 01:11:10,398
 <i> It might help you to</i>
 <i> concentrate your thoughts</i>

760
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:12,367
 <i> on what's good</i>
 <i> for your daughter.</i>

761
01:11:12,369 --> 01:11:13,568
        For some reason I don't
        want to focus on her.

762
01:11:15,771 --> 01:11:18,039
 <i> Your animal connection</i>
 <i> with her may not feel</i>
 <i> like it's there,</i>

763
01:11:18,041 --> 01:11:19,307
 <i> but it will come back.</i>

764
01:11:20,843 --> 01:11:21,909
                  I think

765
01:11:27,283 --> 01:11:29,584
     she and I need a break
     from each other.

766
01:11:29,586 --> 01:11:31,586
    <i> Jules needs your help</i>
    <i> with her transition</i>
    <i> into prep school.</i>

767
01:11:31,588 --> 01:11:32,420
             She hates me.

768
01:11:39,695 --> 01:11:41,896
   She'll probably be relieved
   to get away from me.

769
01:11:46,001 --> 01:11:46,868
            But I don't mind.

770
01:11:51,674 --> 01:11:53,074
   <i> Then what was the point</i>
   <i> of any of this?</i>

771
01:11:55,511 --> 01:11:56,377
Do you
 remember this place?

772
01:11:57,980 --> 01:11:59,414
 Yeah. We met here
 before Christmas.

773
01:11:59,416 --> 01:12:00,081
               Well, we didn't.

774
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:08,756
 Someone's got to straighten
 out your priorities

775
01:12:08,758 --> 01:12:10,425
 before you squander
 everything for Jules.

776
01:12:20,035 --> 01:12:21,903
 This might be a bigger
 sacrifice than you imagine.

777
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:26,374
 Gwen, it's not like you're a
 consciousness in a jar

778
01:12:26,376 --> 01:12:27,108
 that we're dumping
  into another jar.

779
01:12:28,610 --> 01:12:30,645
 The technology is
 not there yet.

780
01:12:30,647 --> 01:12:33,414
 What do you mean? My marketing
 characterizes the procedure.

781
01:12:33,416 --> 01:12:35,616
   It's just that,
   a consciousness transplant.

782
01:12:35,618 --> 01:12:36,751
 That's marketing.

783
01:12:38,053 --> 01:12:39,821
       What's the reality then?

784
01:12:39,823 --> 01:12:41,422
 In order to reproduce
 your memories,

785
01:12:41,424 --> 01:12:44,125
 we have to plant
 electrodes in your brain.

786
01:12:44,127 --> 01:12:46,961
 And in the brain
 of the new host.

787
01:12:46,963 --> 01:12:49,464
 We use a semi-separable
 feedback loop between
 the two of you,

788
01:12:49,466 --> 01:12:51,933
 to generate a
 psycho-physiological twin.

789
01:12:51,935 --> 01:12:53,735
 New neurons, cloned matter.

790
01:12:54,436 --> 01:12:55,503
                         Wait.

791
01:12:56,605 --> 01:12:57,472
                   Twin?

792
01:12:59,508 --> 01:13:01,142
 She'll be a copy of you.

793
01:13:01,144 --> 01:13:03,544
 Same skills,
 same likes and dislikes,
 same personality,

794
01:13:03,546 --> 01:13:05,947
 but an entirely
 separate awareness.

795
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:09,016
             So there'll be
             two of me then?

796
01:13:14,156 --> 01:13:17,024
 Once the electrodes
 are removed,

797
01:13:17,026 --> 01:13:19,527
 the host brain
 can repair itself
 because it's still young.

798
01:13:21,430 --> 01:13:22,764
 But your older brain can't.

799
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:26,734
 Your particular awareness
 will cease to exist.

800
01:13:30,739 --> 01:13:32,106
       You mean, I'm gonna die?

801
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:47,989
 Your cloned brain will wake up
 in the new body
 with all your memories,

802
01:13:47,991 --> 01:13:51,025
  and since she knows
 nothing else, she'll
  believe she's you.

803
01:14:01,136 --> 01:14:04,005
  But this is still Jules' only
  chance, though, isn't it?

804
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:08,609
 Please don't do this.

805
01:14:09,611 --> 01:14:10,678
                       I want

806
01:14:11,747 --> 01:14:12,613
      Christmas with her first.

807
01:14:19,621 --> 01:14:20,488
               And, Dave,

808
01:14:24,026 --> 01:14:26,160
          Jules can never know.

809
01:14:36,538 --> 01:14:38,139
 Gwen needed you to perform
 without misgivings.

810
01:14:39,875 --> 01:14:41,742
 So I excluded this memory
 from the transfer.

811
01:14:52,054 --> 01:14:54,889
 She gave away her life
 with her daughter.

812
01:14:54,891 --> 01:14:56,591
  There's nothing inside of you
  that knows what that meant.

813
01:15:00,195 --> 01:15:01,229
 There's nothing left.

814
01:15:47,776 --> 01:15:49,076
Sales are
        through the roof.

815
01:15:49,078 --> 01:15:50,111
   Was I someone else before?

816
01:15:52,848 --> 01:15:53,714
Body donor.

817
01:15:55,817 --> 01:15:58,819
     Do you remember my last
     conversation with Gwen
     in the holding room?

818
01:16:03,625 --> 01:16:07,695
  Can you feel that part of her
  reaching through you
  towards her little girl?

819
01:16:15,203 --> 01:16:16,170
            That part is lost.

820
01:16:21,310 --> 01:16:23,911
   Just inform me if you need
   any additional changes.

821
01:17:14,896 --> 01:17:16,230
            Did you kill her?

822
01:17:19,735 --> 01:17:20,868
  She did this.

823
01:17:27,109 --> 01:17:28,743
 She's gone, Jules.

824
01:17:28,745 --> 01:17:28,976
  I'm sorry.

825
01:17:33,215 --> 01:17:34,215
           I don't believe you.

826
01:17:38,387 --> 01:17:39,253
          She wouldn't do that.

827
01:18:09,051 --> 01:18:11,118
 I can't seem to find my...

828
01:18:13,288 --> 01:18:14,288
 Medicine.

829
01:18:20,896 --> 01:18:22,797
 I'm not gonna be here
 for anyone else.

830
01:18:29,237 --> 01:18:31,772
 I'm not gonna be here
 for any other reason.

831
01:20:50,946 --> 01:20:51,612
  What's wrong?

832
01:20:55,584 --> 01:20:56,951
            I don't really know
            why I'm alive.

833
01:21:05,293 --> 01:21:06,160
   Doesn't matter.

834
01:21:08,063 --> 01:21:09,463
 Whatever you do will be
 wonderful and worthwhile.

835
01:21:12,334 --> 01:21:13,400
             How do you know?

836
01:21:16,137 --> 01:21:17,004
   I know because you're kind.

837
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:24,445
          People say being kind
          is being weak.

838
01:21:31,219 --> 01:21:32,419
 You're alive because
 of energy

839
01:21:34,089 --> 01:21:35,155
     and empathy.

840
01:21:37,626 --> 01:21:40,427
 Your mother had
 so much of it inside of her,
 she needed to get it out.

841
01:21:41,663 --> 01:21:42,997
  So she made you.

842
01:21:44,366 --> 01:21:45,499
            You're starting to
            sound like her.

843
01:23:25,567 --> 01:23:26,767
    I'm sweating.

844
01:23:26,769 --> 01:23:27,634
  I hate sweating.

845
01:23:29,437 --> 01:23:30,537
   Are they late?

846
01:23:30,539 --> 01:23:33,307
             Relax.

847
01:23:33,309 --> 01:23:35,009
  Let's do the meditation thing
  you learned at camp.

848
01:23:36,211 --> 01:23:37,044
                That was fun.
