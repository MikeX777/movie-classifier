(Thunder)

2
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,239
She's dead.

3
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,350
(He shouts) Holz! Echeverria!

4
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,915
(Knocking / distant voices)

5
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,474
Adolfo's... by the door.

6
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,838
Darling, I promise. Come.

7
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,439
Darling, how was I?

8
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,120
- Sublime.
- Really? Oh, kiss me!

9
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,117
(Sighs)

10
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,031
Guess who, madame?

11
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,628
(Sighs) Lilies.

12
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,637
It has to be him again.

13
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,194
"'Divine one. Ever more tightly
around our two souls

14
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,596

between your voice and my ear."'

15
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,951
"'Yours eternally, Emmanuel Droz."'

16
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,356
- You know what to do.
- Yes. The same as all the others.

17
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,835
He could at least change his florist.

18
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:40,351
Oh, darling, why worry about it?
I don't even know who the man is.

19
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,708
Quick!

20
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,071
- Inside or outside?
- Oh! Oh, inside!

21
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,509
(Sighs) Take me!

22
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,279
(Gasps) Quick!

23
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,391
(Clock chimes)

24
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,197
Ritorno subito.

25
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,917
Ti juro.

26
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,953
Guardami.

45
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,717
She's dead.

46
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,035
Holz! Echeverria!

47
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,198
She will never sing...
to your music again.

Malvina... everything's ready.

60

All that remains to be addressed...

61
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,717
...is the tuning.

62
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,752

Emmanuel... the piano tuner is here.

86
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,957
So, how many pianos
does Doctor Droz have?

87
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,548
Pianos? There are no pianos here.

88
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:14,832
But I'm sure the Doctor will give you
his instructions himself tomorrow.

89
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,157
These are your quarters.

90
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,952

91
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,510
Look. Here we are.

92
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,511
There you are... and here I am.

93
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,868
And over there... are the gardeners.

94
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,639
And here now is the Doctor...

95
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,230

to Villa Azucena.

100

under false pretences? '

102

into a painting already painted? '

'The next morning,
Assumpta the housekeeper

116

escorted me to meet Doctor Droz.'

117
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,800
Mr Fernandez,
do you believe in dreams?

118
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,911
Yes, I do.

119
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,598
And?

120
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,554
Someone once told me
that certain signs in dreams

121
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,511
could no more explain a dream

122
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:36,668
than the postman's knock could
explain what's... what's in a letter.

123
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,074
Oh.

124
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:42,432
I suppose that would certainly depend
on how hard the postman knocked.

125
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,710
And for how long.

126
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,478
(Laughs)

127
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:51,355
I had a dream last night,
Mr Fernandez, and it was of you.

128
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,352
I dreamt dogs were chasing me
through the estate.

129
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,869
We ran and ran down rows of trees.

130
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,549
The more I ran,
the more excited the dogs became.

131
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:07,712
Their noses were at my heels.
And suddenly I stopped.

132
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,192
But the dogs all ran past
and nothing happened.

133
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,197
I... I was...

134
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,276
totally devastated.

135
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,868
Then I looked behind me...

136
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,879
and you were standing there...

137
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,875
...completely rigid.

138
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,711
Asleep... with a handkerchief
in your mouth.

139
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,710
And you were trying
to shout something,

140
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,717
but only saliva dribbled out.

141
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:44,117
What I'd like to know is, why did you
have a handkerchief in your mouth?

142
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,717
(Bird screeches)

143
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,510
Oh, well. (laughs)

144
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:00,395
Why would anyone sleep with
a handkerchief in their mouth anyway?

145
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,357
Look, here we are.

146
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,311
And here's Doctor Droz.

147
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,510
The piano tuner.

148
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,315
And here the last of the replies
to your invitation.

149
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,192
They have all accepted.

150
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,392
- Oh, excellent. Excellent.
- (Man) Doctor.

151
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,672
Doctor. Doctor.
Echeverria's gone missing.

152
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,951
L-L-Later, Holz, er... later.

153
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,036
(Clicks fingers)

154
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,958
Fernandez Felisberto at...

155
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,798
'The Doctor then led me
to the first automaton.'

156
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,157
Feel that.

157
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,351
Water.

158
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,359
All my automata
function by hydraulics.

159
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,678
Then, you're not blind?

160
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,472
No, I'm not blind.

161
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,957
But, I assure you, Doctor,
my touch, my ear,

162
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,640
are no less sensitive
for my being sighted.

163
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,594
And, as I understand it now,

164
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,314
you didn't bring me here
for your pianos, anyway.

165
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:19,992
(Laughs) Mr Felisberto,
since there are no pianos to tune,

166
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,396
I've given you automata instead.

167
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,958
In these machines...

168
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,917
...Mr Felisberto...

169
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,469
...is contained the Dream.

170
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,997
That of music.

171
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:45,348
The most rational irrationality
of all.

172
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:52,071
Of which I, Droz... am the heart.

173
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,592
Sheer artifice, Mr Felisberto.

174
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:04,111
And all this...
dependent upon nature.

175
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,756
'The Doctor told me that
there are seven automata in total.'

176
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,269
'And that there was
very little time left... '

177
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,470
Before the final performance.

178
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,670
- Final performance?
- Unique.

179
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:19,634
Timed for a very special hour.

180
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,594
And... with very special guests.

181
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,599
I'm sure you will understand
the urgency of my request.

182
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,269
'So I was to work on automata,
not pianos.'

183
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,277
'I accepted the challenge.'

184
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,470
Mr Felisberto, bear in mind...

185
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,273
'He explained to me
that they were not toys,

186
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,675
but delicate
and precious instruments.'

187
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,075
'And that I was to pay
special attention

188
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,316
to their musical
and sound qualities.'

189
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,993
Please.

190
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:53,793
'He then presented me
with a set of special tools.'

191
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,797
I bid you good day.

192
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,717
(Cicadas chirrup)

193
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,157
(Gull screeches)

194
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,117
(Whistles)

195
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,912
(Droz) Echeverria!

196
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,799
(Droz) I'll find you!

197
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,078
(Droz) Echeverria!

198
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,077
(Cicadas chirrup)

199
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,839
Adolfo.

200
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,632
Is that you?

201
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,513
(Gull screeches)

202
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,677
(Man shouts)

203
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,391
(Cicadas chirrup)

204
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,956
Lost, piano tuner?

205
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,272
Smell the gums of conifers.

206
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,073
Shut your eyes... and listen.

207
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,593
Which is the true forest,
Mr Fernandez?

208
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,517
This one?

209
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,037
Or that one?

210
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,390
The last one.

211
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,908
(Sighs) How flattering, Mr Fernandez.

212
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:57,438
Yes. I...
"The forest inside the forest."

213
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,390
I was certain you'd lose your way.

214
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,831
Not while my senses
are being so well explored.

215
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,551
Who is Doctor Droz?

216
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,477
- Who is Doctor Droz?
- Yes.

217
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,637
He's a forest no one can inhabit.

218
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:34,238
Oh, that's, er... that's not
what you meant, is it?

219
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:39,115
Doctor Droz
is what they call an alienist...

220
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,676
a healer of broken minds.

221
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,754
And as the Doctor himself puts it,

222
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,954
a man of science
whose great passion is music.

223
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,630
But that's the official version.

224
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,796
And the unofficial?

225
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,398
I'm his living writing paper.

226
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,917
And this place?

227
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,600
It's an asylum.

228
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,029
Or rather a sanctuary,

229
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,914
for those who have undergone
the most fatal of traumas.

230
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:31,790
Those people you saw earlier,
we call them the gardeners.

231
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:36,038
But they are patients here,
who, thanks to Doctor Droz,

232
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,993
have been given back to themselves.

233
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,472
Oh, don't look so serious,
Mr Fernandez.

234
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,673
After a while,
you get used to the confusion.

235
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,794
'On my way back from the first
automaton, I spied through the trees,

236
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,195
high up on the hillside,

237
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,676
what appeared to be
the ruins of a baroque grotto.'

238
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,792
Am I disturbing you, Mr Felisberto?

239
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,434
It's real, isn't it?

240
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,511
Do you think it was planned?

241
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,870
No.

242
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,391
1755. It was the earthquake
in Lisbon.

243
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,957
(Droz) And the tremors
were felt as far as Salamanca.

244
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,311
How would you know such a thing,
Mr Felisberto?

245
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,276
It's my only gift.

246
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:52,871
I can hear anything
between a sneeze and infinity.

247
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,632
No doubt you come
from a long line of piano tuners.

248
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:02,878
For three centuries, we Fernandezes
have never had children.

249
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:08,592
Then... how were you born?

250
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:15,637
Ah, Doctor... that's the secret
of our sainted mothers.

251
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:21,953
'It seemed the Doctor and I
had reached an understanding.'

252
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,470
So we have destiny to thank

253
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:30,958
for permitting us to be
what we will become to each other.

254
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,830
(Man shouts in a foreign tongue)

255
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,311
(Shouting continues)

256
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,437
(Cicadas chirrup)

257
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,874
(Man shouts in a foreign tongue)

258
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,632
'End of my first day
at the Villa Azucena.'

259
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:16,560
'To my surprise, I have entirely
retuned the first automaton.'

260
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,519
'The Doctor was right when he
admitted that he failed to predict

261
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,679
the effects of the sea air
upon his machines.'

262
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:32,190
'And then, I was close to fainting
from repeatedly holding my breath

263
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,630
while I scraped
an almost microscopic mould

264
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,514
off the most intricate
flywheel imaginable.'

265
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:50,110
'The Doctor's constructs are almost
frightening in their subtlety.'

266
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,752
'The machine revealed
a little row of singing teeth

267
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:59,919
that miraculously
still retain their pitch.'

268
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,032
'Lt's true, they are not pianos,

269
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,515
but I'm certainly
enjoying the privilege

270
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,871
of working on
these mechanical marvels.'

271
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,358
'He said not to call them toys,

272
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,358
but I still cannot quite see
their purpose.'

273
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,633
And was that singing
I heard last night?

274
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,877
(Speaks Spanish)

275
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,877
(Speaks Spanish)

276
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,391
(Speaks Spanish)

277
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,035
(Earring tinkles)

278
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:00,992
You play the black keys
and I'll sing the white.

279
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,157
(She stomps)

280
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,591
(She speaks Spanish)

281
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:20,359
(Stomps / speaks Spanish)

282
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:24,118
- (Droz) I think of you...
- (she speaks Spanish)

283
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:29,712
...as a powerful tree,
shivering in a stormy sky.

284
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,075
Very hard from the roots upwards,

285
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:39,957
which are plunged into
the quivering matter of life itself.

286
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:48,151
(Stomps / speaks Spanish)

287
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:52,990
It rises, as if drawn
by the gulf of the heights.

288
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,473
(Speaks Spanish)

289
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:59,799
And shudders, as the wind stirs
the leaves along its backbone...

290
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:08,151
...as my fingernails mount
the tender furrows of your back...

291
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,838
(whispers in Spanish)

292
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,679
...from the dampness of your thighs...

293
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,791
(she moans)

294
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:20,552
...to the nape... of your neck.

295
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,557
(She sighs)

296
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,351
(She sighs)

297
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,948
(Distorted singing in the distance)

298
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,750
'The next morning, as I was working
on the second automaton,

299
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,440
I'm thinking that I was
a little out of my depth.'

300
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,437
(Tapping)

301
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,597
(Sighs)

302
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,154
Here is the ormolu magnet
you asked for.

303
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,192
The Doctor told me to tell you
that under no account

304
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,518
were you to let the echoes slip
behind the vibrating plates.

305
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,553
And that you should
remove your thumb first.

306
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:55,157
And that you'd know
what he meant by that.

307
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,752
(Sighs)

308
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,189
Was that singing I heard last night?

309
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,473
Maybe it was your teeth,
Mr Fernandez.

310
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,873
Or maybe I was dreaming.

311
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,831
(Sighs)

312
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,837
Well...

313
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,155
it was certainly beautiful.

314
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,157
(Fork vibrates)

315
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,757
(Rumbling)

316
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,310
(Banging)

317
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,476
(Banging)

318
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,237
(Banging)

319
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,077
(Banging intensifies)

320
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,831
Malvina!

321
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,837
(Cicadas chirrup)

322
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,392
(He sighs)

323
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,910
(Footsteps)

324
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,033
(Woman sings in the distance)

325
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,877
(Woman sings operatically)

326
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,557
(Cracking)

327
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,476
(Footsteps)

328
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,477
Malvina.

329
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,311
Malvina!

330
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,431
There is a voice.
I saw her last night.

331
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,790
- Who is she?
- Oh, you mean the Emperor's Canary.

332
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,957
Madame van Stille. The singer.

333
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,594
- Do you know her?
- No.

334
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:03,793
Hmm. Well... (sighs)

335
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,480
The Doctor says
she has had a severe trauma

336
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,831
and needs complete calm
and seclusion.

337
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,475
For my part, all I know

338
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:18,230
is that the Doctor is helping her
to readapt to the stage.

339
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:22,990
Forgive me, but how do you believe
he goes about such a thing?

340
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:26,430
- The Doctor's method for her?
- Hmm.

341
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,755
This I don't know.

342
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:34,671
But he does have an expert knowledge
of the electricity in women.

343
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:39,078
- And, er... does this include you?
- (Fork vibrates)

344
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:46,797
For me, the Doctor's passions
are like the rays of the sun

345
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,434
when they are caught
in a magnifying glass

346
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,278
and they immediately set fire

347
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,153
to whatever object
they find in their way.

348
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:58,432
And you? Did you catch fire?

349
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,630
Oh, yes.

350
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:06,190
But then the fire
eventually burns itself out and...

351
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:09,312
and you just learn how to smoulder.

352
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:15,794
So, erm, no need for
the fire brigade, huh, Mr Fernandez?

353
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:20,436
Enough. I should leave you...
with the Doctor's toys.

354
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,597
Doctor...!

355
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,517
(Cicadas chirrup)

356
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,029
'I went looking for the Doctor

357
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:54,436
and found
his mysterious patient instead.'

358
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,437
Madame.

359
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,589
Madame? Madame?

360
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,597
Adolfo?

361
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,037
(Softly) I'm sorry.

362
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:24,552
Madame, I didn't mean to disturb you.

363
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:28,309
It's me, Felisberto, the piano tuner.

364
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,956
It's beautiful here.

365
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:41,432
I wanted to tell you about myself.

366
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,437
I come from over there.

367
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,637
I must leave now.

368
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,277
(Softly) Goodbye.

369
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,310
(Cicadas chirrup)

370
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,198
Doctor.

371
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,790
Good morning. This part.

372
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,951
(Laughs)

373
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:54,993
No rats get in, only... rust.

374
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:02,675
Have you ever heard of
Megaloponera foetens, Mr Felisberto?

375
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:11,030
It's an ant that lives
in the Cameroonian rainforests.

376
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:15,073
A forager of the forest floor, which
from time to time becomes infected

377
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,272
through inhaling
the microscopic spore of a fungus

378
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,675
that rains down from the trees above

379
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:26,670
and lodges in its tiny brain...
where it starts to grow.

380
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:33,230
Troubled and disoriented, this ant
is driven to leave the forest floor

381
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:37,876
and starts to climb up
the stems of ferns and creepers

382
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,790
till it reaches some seemingly
pre-determined height.

383
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:47,630
At which point, it clamps
its mandibles onto the plant

384
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,069
and waits there...

385
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,752
...until it dies.

386
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:58,038
As for the fungus, it lives on,
eating the dead creature's brain

387
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:01,357
and infiltrating
its entire nervous system.

388
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:06,190
Until at length,
some few weeks later,

389
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:11,553
it excretes a sort of spike through
the remains of the insect's head.

390
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:17,312
And this rampant prong
teems with spores,

391
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:22,116
which, in their turn, shed themselves
onto the ground below,

392
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:28,793
raining down for the next
unsuspecting floor-foraging ant.

393
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:54,514
(Sighs)

394
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,358
(Whistles)

395
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,233
(Cicadas chirrup)

396
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,792
(Knocking)

397
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,754
'Three days have passed already.'

398
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,510
'Nothing is as it seems.'

399
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:22,314
'The Doctor's insect story...

400
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,196
...that woman on the bench, Malvina,

401
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:29,357
calling out
for someone who isn't there,

402
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,789
yet singing so beautifully.'

403
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:37,116
'And the strange dreams
that come to me in the night.'

404
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:43,876
'Perhaps even these automata
are not what they pretend to be.'

405
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:13,957
(Whistles)

406
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:17,957
(Bird calls)

407
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:24,273
Loitering with intent, piano tuner?

408
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:28,399
I wouldn't be if I had a shoelace.

409
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:34,593
You don't waste any time
getting under people's feet, do you?

410
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:38,632
Often, when I lace up my shoes,

411
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:42,036
I notice only afterwards
that my tongue,

412
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:46,039
which I'd assumed was inside,
is still hanging outside.

413
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:51,397
But then, you probably
weren't paying attention.

414
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:56,349
So, where do you think
my tongue is now?

415
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:06,433
(Assumpta) Who loves me, follows me.

416
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,517
(Chuckles softly)

417
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:31,149
You're not being distracted,
are you, Mr Felisberto?

418
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:36,354
No. No, no. On the contrary...
I'm totally absorbed.

419
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,836
It feels like I'm living
in someone else's imagination.

420
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:44,240
Has she shown you her tongue yet?

421
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:46,951
(Laughs)

422
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:52,791
She is incorrigible, isn't she,
Mr Felisberto? (laughs)

423
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:56,993
So, I needn't ask...

424
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:00,551
...if we are on schedule?

425
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:02,989
You needn't, Doctor.

426
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,116
I thought as much.

427
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:11,717
Doctor Droz,
are you preparing another automaton?

428
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:17,191
In a manner of speaking, yes.

429
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:19,470
Is it an opera?

430
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:25,311
(Laughs) Let's just say
it's my own small contribution

431
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,954
to the operatic canon.

432
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:32,235
Then that would explain
the voice I've heard at night.

433
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:35,079
It is very special,
I believe, to you.

434
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:41,877
There's no country, no city,
no theatre, no recital,

435
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,151
I have not been to for that voice.

436
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,477
And now it's here.

437
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:54,277
There is where I hear it from.
What a beautiful soul it must take

438
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:57,119
to produce a voice like that.

439
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:00,118
Soul, Mr Felisberto?

440
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:03,152
(Distant shouting)

441
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,238
(Sighs) There's a big word.

442
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:08,555
Ah.

443
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:11,319
How you compliment me.

444
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:15,559
- My every instinct.
- (Distant shouting)

445
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:20,676
The fourth machine is awaiting you.

446
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,631
There's not much time.

447
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:24,838
(Distant shouting)

448
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:29,030
(Shouting)

449
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:34,837
(Shouts)

450
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,677
(Cicadas chirrup)

451
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,030
(Crow caws)

452
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:55,037
(Cicadas chirrup)

453
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:14,558
(Thunder)

454
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,397
(She gasps)

455
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,357
- (Cicadas chirrup)
- (She sighs)

456
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:26,989
Here. It's me, Felisberto,
the piano tuner.

457
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,076
Be quiet so I can hear.

458
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,714
(Cicadas chirrup)

459
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:34,354
(Softly) Adolfo.

460
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:46,836
(Sighs) All these lights,
these people, the guests.

461
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,474
Tomorrow we marry.

462
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:53,149
Everyone can hear it in my voice.

463
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,553
The Doctor, he...

464
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:02,195
I'm sure the Doctor
has your best interests at heart.

465
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,356
They say it's bad luck

466
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,948
to look at each other
on the eve of your wedding.

467
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:09,674
(Felisberto)
But that's just superstition.

468
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,950
(Malvina) No, his eyes...

469
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:15,590
The Doctor...

470
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:18,188
His eyes...

471
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:23,751
...following me, burning me.

472
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:25,836
(Gasps)

473
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:29,475
I was singing and then...

474
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:34,037
and then I turned towards you.

475
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:36,037
Towards me?

476
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:40,395
And the walls slid away.

477
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:45,837
And then?

478
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:52,678
I'm neither in this world
nor the next.

479
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:59,310
Tell me... who I am.

480
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,789
Tell me if I'm me.

481
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,637
(Waves lap)

482
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,876
The singer.

483
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:38,116
I saw the piano tuner
with the singer...

484
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:42,157
...this afternoon, on the bench.

485
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:45,429
She called him Adolfo.

486
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:50,993
And did he answer?

487
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:55,033
Oh, he seemed to love it,
being called Adolfo.

488
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:57,997
Adolfo!

489
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:03,792
Do you think
Adolfo's his middle name?

490
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:09,710
Don Felisberto Adolfo Fernandez.

491
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:17,075
Adolfo Carino. (gasps)

492
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,712
No?

493
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:26,079
- I wonder if he can sing.
- I think not.

494
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:29,115
Then he could whistle.

495
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:33,397
What might he whistle then?

496
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:36,671
Emmanuel,
he could whistle a tango.

497
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:43,312
With all that facial excreta
and ecstatic nose bleeds!

498
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,278
I think not.

499
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:52,674
But, er, maybe
there's a role for you, Assumpta.

500
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:56,031
Oh. I already have one.

501
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:00,110
I've always had one...

502
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:02,713
...Emmanuel.

503
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:04,512
Of course.

504
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:07,474
The illustrious whore.

505
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:14,637
Whose garments are wiped clean
by the epileptic's saliva.

506
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:20,992
Oh, but we did, already,
that one, Emmanuel.

507
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:22,792
Last year.

508
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,512
You're forgetting.

509
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:32,153
Maybe your hammer is,
erm, needing... fresh leather?

510
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:42,315
(Distant shouting) Assumpta!

511
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:05,755
(Distant shouting)

512
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:17,033
(Felisberto)
'That night, the gardeners' shouts

513
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,037
led me to another automaton.'

514
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,911
'Malvina.'

515
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,549
'She looked at me, she saw me,

516
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:48,229
she spoke to me, she held my hand.'

517
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:51,158
'But she called me
someone else's name.'

518
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:55,595
(Assumpta) 'ls that why she's here? '

519
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:58,359
'Because this Adolfo abandoned her,

520
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,596
and then she tried
to take her own life? '

521
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:10,112
(Whistling)

522
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:20,751
So everything's fodder for tangos,
huh, Mr Felisberto?

523
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,950
Forgive me, Doctor, I've been here...

524
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:26,516
Mr Felisberto, I must draw
your attention to the fact

525
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:30,155
that the woman
with whom you were seen

526
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:34,796
trying to engage in conversation
yesterday is a patient of mine.

527
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:38,952
The lady has suffered
a grave illness.

528
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:44,598
Her condition, shall we say,
might even be described as, er,

529
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:46,597
terminal.

530
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:49,109
So, you will kindly desist

531
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:53,233
from importuning her any further.

532
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:58,275
- Importuning? That's the last...
- Have I made myself clear?

533
00:59:58,400 --> 00:59:59,674
Good.

534
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:03,110
(Felisberto) 'Then, to my surprise,
the Doctor invited me

535
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:06,630
to play a small but special role
in his opera.'

536
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:09,672
'He explained
that it would be a reconstruction

537
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:14,112
of Madame van Stille's trauma,
and that only by using this therapy

538
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:18,199
could he ever hope to bring her back
to her more natural self.'

539
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:21,710
And what was her trauma,
if I may be so bold?

540
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:25,115
Oh, tragically...

541
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:29,312
...her fiancé broke off
their relationship

542
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:34,230
the very day before
they were due to be married.

543
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:36,920
Of course I'd do anything
to help Madame Malvina,

544
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:41,477
but as I said, my voice is hopeless.

545
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:43,238
I can't sing.

546
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,798
You needn't.

547
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:48,718
You will whistle.

548
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:00,715
(Thud)

549
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:28,950
I am like certain feminine opera fans
who listen only with their clitoris.

550
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:35,953
Look closely
at that triangular muscle.

551
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:40,639
These vocal folds...

552
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:47,033
...made up from nerves,
blood vessels and membranes.

553
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:50,759
Then imagine Malvina's.

554
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:54,712
As delicate as ripening grapes.

555
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:58,118
A scent just waiting,

556
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,515
anticipating,

557
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:05,475
dreaming of succumbing
to pollutions of mist and fogs

558
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:07,591
upon the coolest slopes.

559
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:12,515
Malvasia.

560
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:14,312
Mammolo.

561
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:16,715
Marzemino.

562
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:21,550
And this sublime prolonged weight
of her vocal cords

563
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:24,797
around my music,

564
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:29,710
slowly breaking
the cap of its skin...

565
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:34,635
...oozing swollen juices,

566
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:38,948
crushed and glistening vanillas.

567
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:54,631
(Felisberto) 'Doctor,

568
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:57,354
clearly it's you
who's inhaled the spore

569
01:02:57,480 --> 01:03:00,119
of Malvina's voice.'

570
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:11,829
(Mumbles)

571
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:41,988
Malvina.

572
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:54,351
Adolfo.

573
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:02,592
See?

574
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:05,996
Good. Once more.

575
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:13,429
How many times more?

576
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,111
Kiss me.

577
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:23,195
The Doctor rests every afternoon
from three to five.

578
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:10,596
Madame? Malvina?

579
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:14,395
- It's me, Felisberto.
- Piano tuner.

580
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:17,638
(Malvina) Yes.

581
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:27,879
Do you... hear that?

582
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:33,430
The rocks.

583
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:39,109
I can hear them at night.

584
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:50,872
Malvina?

585
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,672
Where is Adolfo?

586
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:57,517
The dead love the most, love longest.

587
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:02,598
Malvina.

588
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:06,598
Adolfo's by the door.

589
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:17,837
Can you see him?

590
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:21,990
- Yes. There, by the door.
- Hmm.

591
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:27,988
Table.

592
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:29,599
Vase.

593
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:31,597
And in it?

594
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:36,069
Orchids.

595
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:38,599
There's a window.

596
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:43,711
Yes, a window.

597
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:48,470
Round window
with a girl dropping confetti.

598
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:50,670
With a girl dropping confetti.

599
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:53,798
In this room.

600
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:56,150
'With a girl dropping confetti.'

601
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:59,272
- In this room.
- 'With a girl dropping confetti.'

602
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:02,870
- In this room.
- 'With a girl dropping confetti.'

603
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:06,397
What happened?

604
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:10,157
With a girl...

605
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:06,233
(Felisberto) 'I found steps
which led me beneath the stage.'

606
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:09,352
'Everything she spoke about
had been there.'

607
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:13,519
'The door, the orchids,
the round window.'

608
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:15,312
'Were they all part

609
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:18,671
of the Doctor's reconstruction

610
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:20,950
for the final performance? '

611
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:31,913
(Howling)

612
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:51,953
(Crash of thunder)

613
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,434
(Distant shouting)

614
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:17,834
'I saw my face.'

615
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:22,032
'My reflection.'

616
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:25,152
'And then, for a second,
everything seemed to sag.'

617
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:29,516
(Piercing whistle)

618
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,230
But that's my whistle in there.

619
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:44,039
See, my little floor-foraging ant?

620
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:45,798
Didn't I tell you?

621
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:50,833
Here. I'll give you a hand.

622
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:54,789
Well, Doctor, your machine,

623
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:57,718
it swallowed my whistle.

624
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:01,760
And somehow,

625
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:03,757
my reflection.

626
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:08,439
Did you not think me capable?

627
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:13,510
But I might...

628
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:15,710
But I might need it.

629
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:18,590
(Droz) 'Real illnesses here

630
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:23,635
are absolutely essential
for the imagination.'

631
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:29,197
'Higher.'

632
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:31,752
'Higher still.'

633
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:36,193
'Back. Back.'

634
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:39,392
'Yes. And around.'

635
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:44,469
(Felisberto) 'Yesterday afternoon,
I saw two suns.'

636
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:47,273
'And my watch has stopped.'

637
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:56,553
(Thunder)

638
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:04,789
(Droz) 'Higher.'

639
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:09,992
'Higher still.'

640
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:16,152
'It clamps its mandibles
onto the plant

641
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:20,034
and waits there until it dies.'

642
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:25,199
'As for the fungus, it lives on.'

643
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:44,514
'Ln older kingdoms, they used
to put out the eyes of birds

644
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:46,835
to make them sing better.'

645
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:33,830
(Felisberto) 'But here is the king,
Droz, who is telling the stories.'

646
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:36,520
'One every day for six days.'

647
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:42,238
'The seventh story,
the seventh automaton,

648
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:44,510
will surely surely spell the end.'

649
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:49,713
'No... '

650
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:53,116
'No, he can't get away with it.'

651
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:55,993
'He mustn't! He's the evil one! '

652
01:13:57,200 --> 01:14:00,795
'He's the one who must perish!
Not the innocent princess! '

653
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:02,990
'Not the innocent princess! '

654
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:08,233
I know what has to be done.
It's the door.

655
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:10,191
The carriage.

656
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:14,755
I must have left the carriage
while I was sleeping.

657
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:20,394
Malvina. Malvina!

658
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:22,590
Are you listening to me?

659
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:25,470
Act three.

660
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:35,876
You're burning.

661
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,150
I love you.

662
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:40,077
Feel me...

663
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:43,519
...Adolfo.

664
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:54,431
You shouldn't be here!

665
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:59,037
The Doctor is coming.

666
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:23,834
Has she remembered your name yet?

667
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:30,509
(Laughter)

668
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:34,596
(Felisberto)
'Droz is laughing at me.'

669
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:56,597
(Laughter slows down)

670
01:16:58,120 --> 01:16:59,997
(Laughter stops)

671
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:09,792
If all the automata here
depend on my power to tune them,

672
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:12,798
then it is also in my power
to mistune them.

673
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:18,875
Droz is making me guess
all the correct alignments.

674
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,070
Yesterday, a calendar told me

675
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:24,078
there will be an eclipse tomorrow.

676
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:30,116
Its trajectory will flood along
this path straight to the stage.

677
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:32,310
Shh!

678
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:43,468
It's timed to coincide with
the opening of the door.

679
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:47,912
Assumpta,
will you share a drink with me?

680
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:53,558
Poisoned chalice, Emmanuel?

681
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:00,034
(Droz) Bitter,

682
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:03,038
on the back of the tongue.

683
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:07,550
Verging... towards leather.

684
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:12,871
And even violets.

685
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:16,677
Or violence.

686
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:24,476
Why not?

687
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:26,318
Quite.

688
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:32,390
(Droz) Violets.

689
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:34,750
(Glass hums)

690
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,309
(Felisberto whispers) The door.

691
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:38,034
(Felisberto) 'And the tremors... '

692
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:41,675
(Droz)
'... were felt as far as Salamanca.'

693
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:48,192
Felisberto Fernandez,
Piano Tuner of Earthquakes.

694
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:54,037
(Distant thunder)

695
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:04,071
Then you've chosen
to leave me to sadness.

696
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:07,917
To an even lesser role.

697
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:10,553
The future.

698
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:14,639
'Assumpta, listen carefully.'

699
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:20,112
'Soon, very soon,

700
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:25,439
Villa Azucena
will have become little more

701
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:28,120
than a memory.'

702
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:31,110
It will accumulate its infinity,

703
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:36,675
here, just behind your eyes.

704
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:43,758
By who else, Emmanuel?
By who else, if not by you?

705
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:57,837
(Speaks foreign tongue)

706
01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:02,632
(Droz) 'I will, at last,
revenge the stench

707
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:06,309
of waving handkerchiefs
at the opera houses

708
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:10,399
that have denied my music.'

709
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:08,192
Adolfo.

710
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:00,430
(Bird sings)

711
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:36,830
(Very slow, very quiet music)

712
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:31,029
(Mechanical music)

713
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:37,637
(Slow music)

714
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:40,755
(Mechanical music)

715
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,916
(Slow music)

716
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:51,479
(Mechanical music)

717
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:01,995
(Louder music)

718
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:06,077
(Operatic singing)

719
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:30,676
(Brass music)

720
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:42,190
(Operatic singing)

721
01:26:13,720 --> 01:26:15,836
(Droz) She's dead.

722
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:19,950
Holz, Echeverria!

723
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:25,676
(Whispering)

724
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:30,232
(Thunder)

725
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:32,551
(Gasping)

726
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:37,350
I can hear them at night.

727
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:40,831
(Droz) Sing, Malvina!

728
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:42,355
Sing!

729
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:45,715
Adolfo...

730
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:47,432
Malvina, it's me.

731
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:55,998
Adolfo's by the door.

732
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:58,315
(Thunder)

733
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:39,713
(Adolfo) Malvina!

734
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:44,676
(Droz) Assumpta, soon Villa Azucena

735
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:48,952
will have become
little more than a memory.

736
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:25,598
(Felisberto) 'I never saved Malvina.'

737
01:29:25,720 --> 01:29:29,508
'I never made it
past the sixth automaton.'

738
01:29:29,640 --> 01:29:34,998
'Didn't Droz tell me
he was capable of such a thing? '

739
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:38,715
'And my love for Malvina,
was this only an illusion? '

740
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:46,876
'These thoughts preserve me now,
here, inside the sixth automaton,

741
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:52,711
where I dream mechanically
with the tides amongst the rocks,

742
01:29:52,840 --> 01:29:55,434
where they can never separate us.'

743
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:25,871
Malvina.

744
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:29,470
The dead love the most,
love the longest.
