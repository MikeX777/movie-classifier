1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:04,411
My grandmother Kaku used to tell me
me stories again and again,

2
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:07,289
handed down by our ancestors about
the Chindi,

3
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:09,874
which is a Navajo word for spirit.

4
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:13,795
But in contrast to Casper, the
the Chindi was one that could not be tamed,

5
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:19,101
all-consuming evil power that exacted revenge
for the injustice done to our people.

6
00:00:19,895 --> 00:00:22,057
Well, cheers then.

7
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:50,123
Serves them right.

8
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,254
First they seize
the land under their nails,

9
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:54,006
and then they don't even give anything away.

10
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:58,635
Only a dead Injun is a
a good Injun, right?

11
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:00,508
Cheers!

12
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:03,845
How the hell would you know that?
You weren't out there with us.

13
00:01:04,106 --> 00:01:05,096
What?

14
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:08,900
What we did,
was not completely housebroken.

15
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:12,024
It's a shame that the elders weren't
were with us from the beginning

16
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:15,528
and saw the boy.
He was really something.

17
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,783
But what's done is done.

18
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,539
Amen, Captain. Well said.

19
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,236
Who is that?

20
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:37,688
What...

21
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:07,305
I don't know what you are,

22
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:10,266
but you haven't seen
seen the last of me.

23
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:58,186
CLOWN MOTEL

24
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,392
WELCOME TO THE WORLD FAMOUS CLOWN MOTEL
OFFICE

25
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:04,478
Feet.

26
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:09,692
Yes,.

27
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,697
You know, Ana, I
admire your small church community.

28
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:18,034
Somehow you manage to
to stay alive again and again.

29
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,499
We have to, Mr. Wilson.

30
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:21,955
We were here before you came

31
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,835
and are still here,
when you are gone again.

32
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,881
First of all
I have no intention of leaving.

33
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,713
You cannot
imagine how many offers

34
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,594
I have already received for this motel.

35
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,766
I knocked them all out.

36
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:38,395
Why didn't your people
did not make an offer

37
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:40,188
when I wanted to buy the store?

38
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:46,813
We were not considered white enough
to be allowed to make an offer.

39
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,107
Well.

40
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,243
That's the way it is.

41
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:54,954
But I can promise you one thing.

42
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,906
If I ever sell the motel
sell the motel, I will make sure,

43
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,993
that the person who buys it also knows
which staff belong to it

44
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,793
and how valuable you people are.

45
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:03,208
Are you implying something?

46
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:05,210
that you would not let us
would let us make you an offer?

47
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,791
No, nothing like that.

48
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:10,299
I just can't imagine
that your bell bag is big enough,

49
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,095
to buy this property.

50
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:15,300
What do you know about the size of
of our bell bag, Mr. Wilson!

51
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:16,975
Ana, take it easy.

52
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,641
You don't want to attack
attack your boss on the same day

53
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:21,563
and be fired,
the day your visitor arrives, right?

54
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,936
Alma is here?

55
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:26,186
I didn't even know
that you had children, Ana.

56
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:29,147
You never asked for it
asked for it, Mr. Wilson.

57
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,550
I had been away for far too long.

58
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,965
I had to go back to where
where I had grown up and do,

59
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:58,138
what I could to expose the
uncover the atrocities,

60
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:00,561
committed against my Greasewood ancestors
were committed.

61
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:15,026
Bloody hell!

62
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:23,000
Now I finally know what the
Clown Motel challenge is all about.

63
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,749
And it looks that way,

64
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,798
I won't get much sleep tonight
not get much sleep tonight.

65
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,133
Hey! Hey Joe!

66
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,070
Well, good to see,

67
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:07,623
that the members of Kaku's
sect have aged quite well.

68
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:10,455
Joe Bamford,

69
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,537
grumpy as ever,

70
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:16,499
and the clothes should
and the clothes could be washed again.

71
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:20,510
Alma,

72
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:25,387
since your childhood
nothing has changed.

73
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,886
Well, maybe apart from the job.

74
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:31,855
But the clowns,

75
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,849
they are still here.

76
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:02,670
It's new.

77
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,644
A remarkable collection.

78
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:18,435
Yes,

79
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:21,484
only much bigger,
since I was a child.

80
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:24,950
That was probably a long time
before I bought the motel.

81
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:29,952
The last time I was here, I was eight
I was eight, around fifteen years ago.

82
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:34,368
I have a few minutes now,
if you want to have the conversation,

83
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,078
that you have asked me for.

84
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:37,496
Yes.

85
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,164
Good.

86
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:48,887
The house looks smaller.

87
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:52,019
In fifteen years, they have probably
have also grown quite a bit.

88
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:55,974
I can't remember the wall
there. And the door, is it new?

89
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,484
You have a good eye, Miss Perez.

90
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,191
A few years ago we
a few years ago.

91
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,989
Behind the wall we have
we laid some pipes

92
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:06,863
and put a small extension there.

93
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:12,870
So you're here to do research for a
research for a college paper, yes?

94
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,157
Yes, exactly.

95
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,918
Is it something economic?

96
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:21,382
It's for my final thesis.
Cultural Anthropology.

97
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:28,715
My final thesis
in cultural anthropology

98
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,765
deals with the
Greasewood Indians.

99
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:32,934
The Greasewood Indians.

100
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:36,139
Is that a North American
Indian tribe?

101
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,770
A tribe of North American
Native Americans, yes.

102
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:41,189
You have never heard of
heard of the Greasewoods?

103
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,529
No, but I don't know
history either.

104
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,817
Well, that seems pretty obvious.

105
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:55,992
Do you know what this
this is, Mr. Wilson?

106
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,630
A creepy clown skull.

107
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:05,293
This stone carving is
not a creepy clown skull,

108
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,340
but a death totem.

109
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,797
It is said to ward off evil spirits.

110
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:12,842
For my studies they are
extremely difficult to find,

111
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,302
and you have several
of them in your collection.

112
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:17,179
Wow.

113
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,062
Are they perhaps even valuable?

114
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,027
Mr. Wilson,

115
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:28,028
Surely you think you know
know everything about your motel.

116
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:31,861
But these horror stories
you tell in your brochures

117
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:34,913
and your website,
are surely on the one

118
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,241
or another way, right?

119
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:38,533
Yes,

120
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,831
There are eyewitnesses.

121
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,546
Tragic deaths have
have occurred in these rooms.

122
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:49,053
And all the time
an evil clown lurks somewhere nearby.

123
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,136
What I would like to know from you is,

124
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:57,345
what was on this site before
the Clown Motel was built.

125
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,271
Sure.

126
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,684
I'll tell you what I know.

127
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:08,985
- Coffee?
- No, thank you very much.

128
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:11,199
I see that you are marketing the cemetery

129
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:14,411
and mining facilities on your website
as tourist destinations and write,

130
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:17,205
that in the 1900s
miners lived here.

131
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,657
Yes, that's right.

132
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:21,952
They actually did.

133
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:26,461
But if you know more, I am
I am very interested, because I am

134
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:29,339
always on the lookout for new
ghost stories for my website.

135
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,549
Horror sells.

136
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:34,761
I'm talking about what was here in
Tonapa was in the 1800s.

137
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:36,930
Back then it was still called Butler City.

138
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:39,265
There was this massacre.

139
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:44,817
And the Greasewoods were built
to build the railroad here,

140
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,768
killed or driven away.

141
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:51,023
There is no railroad nearby.

142
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:52,775
That's exactly how it is.

143
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,947
And that's why I'm trying
to bring light into the darkness.

144
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,413
Okay. I'm all ears.

145
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,837
The reason why no
railroad was built...

146
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,209
Sit down.

147
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,834
...is that those who
committed the massacre,

148
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,294
were massacred themselves.

149
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:14,425
Right here.

150
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:19,431
My research has revealed
that this place used to be called Butler City.

151
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:23,017
Founded by Wyatt Earp,
who passed through here.

152
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,686
Wyatt Earp?

153
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:28,064
What do you say?

154
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,062
Do you have proof of this?

155
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:34,946
Only legends and legends that are
passed down through generations.

156
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:37,236
But I'm looking for evidence,

157
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:41,536
for documents, articles, for
artifacts and records.

158
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:43,992
And this is where you can help me.

159
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,416
There is a cellar
under this building.

160
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,373
I often played in it as a child.

161
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:53,085
And I remember that there was a box down there
box with all these documents.

162
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,304
Do you know anything about
about this box, Mr. Wilson?

163
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,554
No, because the cellar was
already sealed at the time

164
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:01,226
when I bought the motel.

165
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:04,429
The building authorities claimed that
it was structurally unstable

166
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:07,983
and would not comply with
building regulations, and well...

167
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:12,608
Well, if I could get access to that box with
the documents inside,

168
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,990
that would be a great enrichment
for my research work.

169
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:21,247
And if these documents
have historical significance,

170
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:25,122
can I notify the Historical Registrar
and notify this place

171
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,544
into a Greasewood memorial
into a Greasewood memorial.

172
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:29,755
But what happens to my motel then?

173
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,548
Well, I suppose the government
would make you an offer

174
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:37,470
and reclaim the land.

175
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:41,391
Reclaim the land.

176
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:53,571
It's a very good thing that you
you're not studying economics, Miss Perez,

177
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:55,613
because that was the worst
business meeting,

178
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,989
I was ever allowed to lead to
access to my cellar.

179
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:02,996
What possible
reason I should have,

180
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,537
To let them go into my cellar,

181
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:09,203
if I would lose my
would lose my country?

182
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:12,711
Well, possibly,

183
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,211
because it is the only right thing to do.

184
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:29,182
Regardless of this, the
anyone, no matter who,

185
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,312
into the cellar.

186
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:35,566
It is simply unsafe,
because it is in danger of collapsing.

187
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:39,866
They could shut me down,
if I break the rules.

188
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,073
I'm really sorry.

189
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:49,118
So that was it, the cellar,
what you wanted to talk to me about?

190
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,952
If yes,

191
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,955
we have probably ticked off the topic.

192
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:57,751
I wish I could
help you, but I can't.

193
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:05,267
I don't know if you're planning
to go over to the cemetery,

194
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,308
to make a few sketches or something.

195
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:12,982
The gravestones there
are quite remarkable.

196
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:16,899
I'm not sure if this
this meets archaeological standards

197
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:19,694
corresponds to the university,
but the kids like to use it,

198
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:21,571
when they go there.

199
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,780
So,

200
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:30,830
I have to get back to work now
get back to work.

201
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:36,836
Here come a few executives
of the biggest bank in the area

202
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:40,545
to a stag party,
in about 15 minutes or so.

203
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:45,098
That sounds like fat profiteers from the
of the land that was stolen from my people.

204
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,972
I cannot and will not
not contradict it.

205
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,767
Here, please take this.

206
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:56,359
I would like to give it to you,

207
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:59,279
because it means
much more to you than it does to me.

208
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:03,950
You also know, Alma, that the work you do here is important,
that the work you do here is important.

209
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,412
Do not let obstacles
obstacles.

210
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,785
There will be many more of these in your
many more in your life.

211
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:15,003
Very good advice, Mr.
Wilson. Accepted with thanks.

212
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,026
Yes!

213
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:47,323
Yes!

214
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:52,954
- What the hell...
- Stay calm.

215
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:55,330
- Holy shit!
- Well?

216
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:58,834
I know that may not look
may not look like much,

217
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,917
But that's the whole point.

218
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,507
We give Louis a
a fitting farewell,

219
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,343
and this is the perfect place to
to bury a few secrets.

220
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:08,927
- Isn't that right, Mr. Arturo?
- That's right.

221
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:10,099
But you can say that out loud.

222
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:13,853
Well, there are certainly
a lot of things to bury.

223
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:15,431
And knowing Sloan,

224
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,937
he buries his entire
last bonus at the gaming table.

225
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,234
- No, not this time.
- You say that now.

226
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:22,563
Well, me and Brooke are going to
dry out every bar in the area.

227
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,648
- You said it, baby.
- What about Louis here?

228
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:26,108
After all, his wedding is coming up.

229
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:29,077
Sometimes his head is stuck
between the tits of a stripper.

230
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,496
As befits a banker.

231
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:36,164
Yes, we are good bankers. That's why
we deserve a good time.

232
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:37,368
Yes.

233
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,212
Are you sure that
it's safe here?

234
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,210
He booked the trip through a
church congregation.

235
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,337
So as far as I'm concerned,
we are blessed.

236
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:47,630
Nobody gets into difficulties today,
that they can't overcome. Is that clear?

237
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:51,637
So then, first we check in
divide the rooms between us,

238
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:54,720
grab something to eat and then
we'll turn this place upside down.

239
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,806
- This is how we do it.
- I'll take a room with Carrie.

240
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:58,477
Mike, you're with Sloan,

241
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:01,355
and Louis gets a room
for you alone, just in case,

242
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,983
that he might have
should have company tonight.

243
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,104
Yeah!

244
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:08,067
That's not going to happen.
I am faithful. Nothing will happen.

245
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:08,214
What are you doing here?

246
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:48,170
So you've already been here at the motel.

247
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:58,135
Are you spying on me, Kaku?

248
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:01,221
Please, Toko, the book
was lying there when I came in.

249
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:03,518
Of course.

250
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:09,028
This is a forgotten popular belief.

251
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:11,402
I didn't know that the
book was still in print.

252
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,863
It won't. It belonged to mom.

253
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:16,235
Correct.

254
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:19,747
Why do you torture yourself with
all these myths?

255
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,244
The Chindi spirits.

256
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:23,497
Your whole sect is
named after a Chindi.

257
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,961
That was long before my time.

258
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:28,711
I don't like it any more than you do.

259
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:30,542
But it is history.

260
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:33,507
And history is
dark and depressing,

261
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,550
unless you are white.

262
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:45,732
Mr. Wilson told me
why you're here.

263
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,943
It was very unpleasant for him
to find out.

264
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:52,439
It was also very depressing for me.

265
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,203
I'm doing this for us, Kaku.

266
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:01,073
For your sect,

267
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,992
for our family, for our people.

268
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,119
For all of us,

269
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:08,792
that are still left.

270
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:12,550
When your mother left with you
I stayed here.

271
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:14,051
Our church is here.

272
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:17,597
This is still our home, and
you have no right to take it away from us.

273
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:23,053
Do you really think they would
build a memorial in this motel

274
00:25:23,147 --> 00:25:24,888
and leave us our place?

275
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:27,816
We are dealing with the US government.

276
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:30,564
They don't build memorials for us.

277
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:33,605
They build them for themselves.

278
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,441
That's cynical, Kaku

279
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:41,955
Cynical is the word of a young
for older and wiser, Toko.

280
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:48,203
You should write a book about our people
or a documentary.

281
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:51,756
Or put us on a TV show,
that would make me very proud.

282
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:55,339
But this memorial idea?

283
00:25:56,764 --> 00:25:58,505
This is a hopeless endeavor.

284
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:23,822
Kaku is afraid of change.

285
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:30,708
This is due to the insularity of a
religious fringe group like theirs.

286
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:35,462
Kaku believes she is leading the group,

287
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:39,379
and no one can dissuade them.

288
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:02,814
Our church community has
tried to stop the vengeful Chindi

289
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:05,317
from his murderous retribution
on this city.

290
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:09,537
Only we, the Greasewood descendants,
can put an end to the killing.

291
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:55,993
This sabre is the last
part that we have to carry out

292
00:29:56,086 --> 00:29:59,170
of the sacred ritual in order to
banish the Chindi for good.

293
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:04,838
It must be done.

294
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:07,341
Evil must disappear.

295
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:48,172
Kaku, I need to talk to you.

296
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:51,051
Please don't make a scene.
What have you got yourself into now?

297
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:52,674
Have I lost my way?

298
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,223
What have you gotten yourself into with
your sect got yourself into?

299
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:59,688
Into your room. Now.

300
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,825
Kaku, how could you?

301
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:14,570
How could I what, Toko?

302
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:17,115
Your sect has made the booking
for the bankers,

303
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:18,745
who took the piss out of you.

304
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:23,458
Watch your tongue.
That's how I earn my money.

305
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:27,300
We wanted our money back, and that
was the only way to get it.

306
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:30,049
Our agency books the rooms, and
Mr. Wilson gives us a commission.

307
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:31,595
It's as simple as that.

308
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:36,263
There are other possibilities
in the world than just this motel.

309
00:31:36,937 --> 00:31:38,553
I don't understand you, Kaku.

310
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:42,311
And I don't understand you. You are
just as stubborn as your mother.

311
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:44,692
I am punished with a
daughter who doesn't listen,

312
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,686
and a granddaughter,
who is following in her footsteps.

313
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:48,480
Yes.

314
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,614
Because she wanted justice.

315
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,864
True, lasting
Justice for our ancestors.

316
00:31:57,249 --> 00:32:01,118
You can help me with that. I just want
I just want you to let me into the cellar.

317
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:02,956
Absolutely not.

318
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:06,164
Then at least let me
in Clem Wilson's office.

319
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:08,215
Maybe I can find something there.

320
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:11,260
What you need to find,
Alma, is the way to the church.

321
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:14,430
Drop the matter, and I
will do what your mother failed to do.

322
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:16,007
I will teach you our
history

323
00:32:16,143 --> 00:32:17,759
and introduce you to Chindi.

324
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:21,012
Do you actually listen to yourself?

325
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:25,479
You are employed by a completely
unscrupulous man,

326
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:28,399
who takes you like a
Christmas goose.

327
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,534
Why are you protecting this motel,

328
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,328
if you can make this place a
a consecrated place?

329
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:42,333
We are the last of the Greasewood.

330
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:45,078
The name of this motel may
belong to someone else,

331
00:32:45,172 --> 00:32:48,336
but the land and its
spirit have always belonged to us.

332
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,751
Let it go.

333
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:08,943
It would be the best thing,

334
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:12,234
when you've checked out,
before I come back tomorrow.

335
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:16,783
Even better,

336
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,450
you are already leaving today.

337
00:34:40,287 --> 00:34:41,903
BALD WIEDER DA

338
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,467
The old trick still works.

339
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:11,228
The Clown Motel seems to be
to be quite popular.

340
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:14,025
What do you say?

341
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:15,235
WELCOME

342
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:52,282
Shit.

343
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:55,311
You only dance with me.

344
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:08,886
I have finally
into the cellar.

345
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:16,101
Compared to the past
nothing has changed here.

346
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:25,524
I'm surprised Clem Wilson
hasn't made his way down here yet,

347
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:28,401
to find a few exhibits
for his website.

348
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,077
But

349
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,080
everything is still there,

350
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:40,250
after all these years.

351
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,646
Just as I remember it.

352
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:43,291
"The doctors said I had
typhoid. But what do they know?

353
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:45,918
I know it was because of the Greasewood.

354
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:49,626
So I can in my right mind
confess to the crime,

355
00:41:49,716 --> 00:41:53,881
that I have committed, in the hope
that the elders will forgive me,

356
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:56,553
although they have every right
to condemn me

357
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:59,135
and send me into the fires
of hell.

358
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:02,141
Our deceptive maneuver was simple.

359
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:05,930
We lured the two tribal elders
of the Greasewood tribe into the saloon,

360
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:09,142
to negotiate their land for the construction
of the railroad.

361
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:13,563
Captain Cranston, who had set up a unit similar to the Pinkertons
unit similar to the Pinkertons,

362
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:17,149
was hired to secure the
acquisition of the land."

363
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:24,365
"A financial settlement should be
compensation should be negotiated,

364
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:27,122
and the elders came in good faith.

365
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:29,794
I was just there as a distraction,
while Cranston's men

366
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:33,500
murdered the entire tribe,
including the two elders,

367
00:42:33,843 --> 00:42:36,085
when they returned."

368
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:42,384
"I found out that the
younger of the two eldest,

369
00:42:42,477 --> 00:42:46,391
who was killed was not the one
was the one who came into the saloon later.

370
00:42:46,481 --> 00:42:48,188
He moved like a shadow

371
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:51,688
and slaughtered the men
in the most cruel way."

372
00:43:16,636 --> 00:43:18,593
"At the end
he went after the captain."

373
00:43:20,098 --> 00:43:21,930
"Unfortunately, I wanted to

374
00:43:22,517 --> 00:43:26,101
the dignity of the captain
and pulled the sabre away."

375
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:40,403
"Its hideous mouth spat fire
fire, and it had the appearance of it,

376
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:42,652
as if it wanted to devour me."

377
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:50,667
"I pointed Cranston's gun at him,
and he just laughed maniacally.

378
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:53,040
Before he supernaturally
disappeared,

379
00:43:53,131 --> 00:43:55,248
he kept repeating the words:

380
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:58,376
Bai ja pei, Bai ja pei,

381
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:01,470
Bai ja pei, Bai ja pei."

382
00:44:40,136 --> 00:44:42,344
Hey, she's down in the basement.

383
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:45,047
I'm coming as fast as I can.

384
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:49,309
The sabre is ready.

385
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:51,311
It's happening tonight.

386
00:46:36,377 --> 00:46:37,367
And ready?

387
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:38,952
Beauty takes time.

388
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:40,753
Then we'll be sitting here
here all night.

389
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:52,303
This is the stuff
that nightmares are made of.

390
00:46:59,442 --> 00:47:01,809
Let's go! The ladies are waiting.

391
00:47:11,412 --> 00:47:12,573
Perfect!

392
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:18,040
Let's go!

393
00:47:38,064 --> 00:47:39,054
Feet!

394
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:40,559
Hey boss.

395
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:48,155
Just don't think I don't know about
your little conspiracy.

396
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:50,194
- Conspiracy?
- Yes.

397
00:47:50,785 --> 00:47:54,324
You always take the bookings for
these bachelor parties,

398
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:56,617
when I'm working the night shift here.

399
00:47:57,625 --> 00:47:59,366
- Are you going to church?
- Yes, sir.

400
00:48:02,755 --> 00:48:04,121
For the bell bag.

401
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:07,253
- Thanks, boss.
- Okay, no thanks.

402
00:48:13,182 --> 00:48:14,514
Do not worry.

403
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,466
I won't. Good night, Joe.

404
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:17,683
Good night.

405
00:48:25,403 --> 00:48:26,689
Hello?

406
00:48:28,823 --> 00:48:31,657
Johnson, do you ever sleep?

407
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:37,116
I told you, I'm not selling.

408
00:48:37,957 --> 00:48:40,244
I'm not interested in whether
he has Chinese backers.

409
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:43,122
If I don't sell,
then I don't sell.

410
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:59,179
So, please uncover.

411
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:03,597
He's out, and...

412
00:49:03,858 --> 00:49:06,145
Full on the twelve.

413
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:10,024
Mike Hardy, ladies and gentlemen,
remember the name.

414
00:49:10,114 --> 00:49:12,401
- So here you go.
- Thank you beauty.

415
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:14,403
- With pleasure.
- And this one is for you.

416
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:17,236
Thank you, that is really
very thoughtful of you.

417
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:18,945
- Gladly.
- And the inserts.

418
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:22,407
And one for mom,

419
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:24,952
one for dad.

420
00:49:26,881 --> 00:49:28,338
Oh yes.

421
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,997
All set, yes? Map?

422
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:12,086
Yes.

423
00:50:13,594 --> 00:50:14,755
Split.

424
00:50:15,513 --> 00:50:16,924
Not bad.

425
00:50:18,224 --> 00:50:19,214
Lucky guy.

426
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:22,800
And over.

427
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:25,311
Yes!

428
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:28,314
Downright disgusting.

429
00:50:28,484 --> 00:50:32,524
How you try to buy a good time with your
buy a good time with your dirty money.

430
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:35,071
Excuse me?

431
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:36,815
I don't apologize for anything.

432
00:50:37,326 --> 00:50:40,114
These cut-throat
of bankers. All the same.

433
00:50:40,204 --> 00:50:42,537
Give me a break.
We just want to have fun here.

434
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:45,665
Keep your mouth shut before
something slips in.

435
00:50:45,793 --> 00:50:47,159
Just like my fist.

436
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:49,999
Keep your mouth shut before
something I have slips into yours.

437
00:50:50,089 --> 00:50:52,877
- Could you please repeat that.
- What problem do you have?

438
00:50:52,967 --> 00:50:55,710
- Leave it alone. Sit down again.
- Come on, baby, it's no use.

439
00:50:55,928 --> 00:50:58,966
Because of you bankers
lost my business partner.

440
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:01,005
Granted him loans,
even though you knew

441
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:02,390
that he cannot repay them.

442
00:51:02,643 --> 00:51:06,102
And then, as expected, when he defaulted
you fell all over him

443
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,563
and have not only ruined his
his business,

444
00:51:08,649 --> 00:51:10,311
but also his
private property.

445
00:51:12,361 --> 00:51:14,569
In the end, he died on the
from heart failure.

446
00:51:16,657 --> 00:51:17,738
That is my problem.

447
00:51:17,825 --> 00:51:19,316
That's enough. Get out of here!

448
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:22,910
Brooke, sit down, it's no good.
And you, sir, stand back.

449
00:51:22,997 --> 00:51:25,831
What I think
you don't have to tell me!

450
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,202
Hey, take it easy!

451
00:51:27,835 --> 00:51:30,168
Taking someone to the grave and
then dance around on his grave,

452
00:51:30,254 --> 00:51:33,668
that still turns you on, doesn't it?

453
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:36,667
Very nice, away with
him. Well done. Bye!

454
00:51:36,844 --> 00:51:38,631
I'll look after your chips.

455
00:51:38,721 --> 00:51:40,553
What an asshole, man.

456
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:52,436
I'm very sorry.
That was totally out of character for me.

457
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:55,944
I don't know whether it's nerves
or I'm just getting cold feet.

458
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:59,398
It's funny because, as you can
as you can see, I love my girl.

459
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:03,110
You know, she knows that I love her,
and you know that I love her too.

460
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:05,741
So, to cut a long story short, we met
met a year ago.

461
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:08,915
Online, okay. Now it feels
feels like we're rushing it.

462
00:52:09,001 --> 00:52:12,745
An example: I like ice cream, but
I don't know what her favorite ice cream is.

463
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:17,249
I'm sorry that I was so
I threw up on you so awkwardly,

464
00:52:17,343 --> 00:52:18,675
but it just had to come out.

465
00:52:18,761 --> 00:52:20,878
Besides, I've already had
five of these drinks.

466
00:52:21,722 --> 00:52:23,054
I think it's very sweet.

467
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:27,301
It is very sexy when a man
is willing to commit to a woman.

468
00:52:32,191 --> 00:52:33,773
Enjoy your drink.

469
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:52,075
And how I will enjoy it.
It's what she wanted.

470
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:17,942
That's where it's going, my friend.

471
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:53,811
Silence!

472
00:54:17,713 --> 00:54:19,454
Oh boy, am I tired.

473
00:54:20,215 --> 00:54:21,922
The party goes on, folks.

474
00:54:22,009 --> 00:54:24,376
I've just dusted off a round of
of coke from the bartender.

475
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:26,837
Oh no, man, I haven't done that shit
I haven't done since,

476
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,671
since I started
I've been cramming for my exams.

477
00:54:28,724 --> 00:54:30,681
But then it's high time
time. To you or to us?

478
00:54:30,726 --> 00:54:32,558
I'd rather see you,
Mike doesn't seem to be in a good mood.

479
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:34,681
That and coke don't mix well
don't mix well, as I know.

480
00:54:34,772 --> 00:54:35,762
Yes.

481
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:43,811
Fucking city, damn it!

482
00:54:47,868 --> 00:54:49,234
Come on, big guy.

483
00:54:49,453 --> 00:54:52,241
I'll show you what your
future wife doesn't show you.

484
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:01,295
That's what I should do.

485
00:55:16,355 --> 00:55:17,641
Forgive me.

486
00:55:43,799 --> 00:55:44,835
Shit.

487
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:51,967
What the...

488
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:13,197
"Out of the corner of my eye, I kept seeing
shadows moving again and again.

489
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:17,743
They instilled fear in me and
I couldn't do anything about it.

490
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:23,078
As if that could have protected me,
I pointed Cranston's guns at him,

491
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:25,751
to keep him in check.

492
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:32,421
I kept the captain's sabre and
pistol and also his protective totem."

493
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:50,563
This is Joe's box.

494
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:16,134
That doesn't exist.

495
00:57:29,738 --> 00:57:31,525
It has begun.

496
00:58:12,823 --> 00:58:16,658
Carrie, why have you been
all this time?

497
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:19,777
You know that, my darling.

498
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:27,501
Men.

499
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:39,259
Oh, really? Men are like mice.
Afraid of a woman's body.

500
00:58:41,435 --> 00:58:42,801
Carrie?

501
00:58:44,396 --> 00:58:48,185
Guys, this isn't fun anymore.
Unlock the damn door, okay?

502
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:55,187
Carrie?

503
00:59:10,464 --> 00:59:11,454
Carrie!

504
00:59:12,716 --> 00:59:13,706
Sloan.

505
00:59:16,344 --> 00:59:18,051
Say something, boys!

506
00:59:41,328 --> 00:59:42,910
What the hell!

507
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:46,197
And who are you supposed to be?

508
00:59:47,334 --> 00:59:48,791
Oh, now I understand.

509
00:59:48,877 --> 00:59:52,461
You're part of that whole
Clown Motel bla bla bla stuff, right?

510
00:59:54,174 --> 00:59:57,542
Well, you should really
do something for your hair.

511
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,683
Fuck off! Fuck you.

512
01:01:04,035 --> 01:01:07,619
You can do this.
Damn it, you can do it!

513
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:17,917
Nicky, I didn't wake you up, did I?

514
01:01:18,258 --> 01:01:21,001
It's already past midnight.
Why are you calling me so late?

515
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:22,460
Oh, come on,

516
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:24,462
It's not that late after all.

517
01:01:24,556 --> 01:01:26,013
When did you get so old?

518
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:28,557
Since I have children,
Michael. What do you want?

519
01:01:28,727 --> 01:01:31,435
I'm here on a
men's evening in Tonapa.

520
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:34,396
Louis celebrates his
fucking bachelor party.

521
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:37,107
Our Louis is finally getting married.
You know who he is, don't you?

522
01:01:37,194 --> 01:01:39,561
Mike, I have to interrupt you here.

523
01:01:40,864 --> 01:01:43,902
I know what it's all about,
and you can't expect anything from me.

524
01:01:44,201 --> 01:01:45,737
That's not the point.

525
01:01:47,913 --> 01:01:50,576
And even if that were the case
I wouldn't need much.

526
01:01:50,665 --> 01:01:53,658
And if at all,
maybe only two grand.

527
01:01:53,752 --> 01:01:56,540
I don't have them.
So don't ask any more questions.

528
01:01:59,466 --> 01:02:00,832
I'm not asking you to.

529
01:02:01,343 --> 01:02:05,257
You know very well,
that I'm good for two grand.

530
01:02:05,347 --> 01:02:09,011
Look, you give me two, and
and I'll give you two and a half in return.

531
01:02:09,309 --> 01:02:10,800
You're about to wake Jen up, so...

532
01:02:10,936 --> 01:02:13,724
No, you can't just
like that. Don't leave me in the lurch.

533
01:02:14,689 --> 01:02:17,397
Nicky, just a small transfer,
just to keep me flush.

534
01:02:17,484 --> 01:02:18,725
I've got nothing, Mike.

535
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:21,526
And even if I did, Jen would kill me
if I gave it to you.

536
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:24,526
And I can't even blame her for that.
Your fucking bank screwed me.

537
01:02:24,616 --> 01:02:26,073
Or have you already forgotten that?

538
01:02:26,201 --> 01:02:29,535
- I'm hanging up now. Good night.
- No, Nicky! Nicky, don't hang up!

539
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:32,071
Shit!

540
01:02:51,935 --> 01:02:53,142
Stay calm.

541
01:02:53,812 --> 01:02:56,725
Carrie can give you some
money, or Brooke.

542
01:02:57,857 --> 01:02:59,814
Yes, it will work out.

543
01:03:04,572 --> 01:03:07,485
Oh man, I'm going to tell them a
story about the horse

544
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:09,775
and pick up every hundred.

545
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:12,032
Except for Louis, well.

546
01:03:12,831 --> 01:03:15,073
Yes. Three hundred.

547
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:16,994
Three hundred should be enough.

548
01:03:27,846 --> 01:03:29,553
What do you think, handsome?

549
01:03:37,689 --> 01:03:39,305
What the hell is that?

550
01:04:08,803 --> 01:04:10,294
No, no, no.

551
01:04:32,744 --> 01:04:34,326
No, no!

552
01:06:23,855 --> 01:06:25,847
Do you know what
will happen next?

553
01:06:26,065 --> 01:06:28,182
Honestly, I have no idea,
what will happen next.

554
01:06:28,276 --> 01:06:31,644
I'm only used to one woman
and have never been in a situation like this.

555
01:06:31,779 --> 01:06:35,443
Oh my God, I'll probably
I'll probably end up in hell next.

556
01:06:36,117 --> 01:06:37,983
How can you be so sexy?

557
01:06:43,791 --> 01:06:45,828
I've never had vanilla before.

558
01:06:45,919 --> 01:06:47,251
- No?
- No.

559
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:48,998
Then enjoy it.

560
01:06:50,215 --> 01:06:51,547
Oh boy.

561
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:12,188
You know, if you add
a little something on top,

562
01:07:13,488 --> 01:07:16,902
I'll let you believe in all the
superpowers I have.

563
01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:21,740
I don't doubt that for a moment.

564
01:07:40,473 --> 01:07:41,634
Hey!

565
01:07:42,934 --> 01:07:45,017
You don't have
a fucking heart attack?

566
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:45,963
Our Chindi

567
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:50,346
has taken care of our problems.

568
01:09:55,316 --> 01:09:57,057
Who remains now,

569
01:09:58,695 --> 01:10:00,652
is the one who deceived us,

570
01:10:00,947 --> 01:10:03,234
for his shameless selfishness.

571
01:10:08,287 --> 01:10:11,030
Who is trying to claim our heritage.

572
01:10:16,003 --> 01:10:18,916
But the Chindi takes care of it.

573
01:10:20,007 --> 01:10:22,750
Betrayal of our own bloodline.

574
01:10:23,803 --> 01:10:26,170
Theft from our own clan.

575
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:35,141
Until the end of the night,

576
01:10:35,481 --> 01:10:37,188
Yes, until the end of the night,

577
01:10:38,568 --> 01:10:41,527
this motel will have a new
new owner.

578
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:54,071
What are you doing here?

579
01:14:58,035 --> 01:14:59,446
Count the totems.

580
01:15:01,497 --> 01:15:03,159
Nothing has changed.

581
01:15:07,336 --> 01:15:09,168
Then the Chindi is still hunting.

582
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:39,236
I wonder if the murder took place there?

583
01:15:39,326 --> 01:15:41,033
Where all the blood spatter is?

584
01:15:41,328 --> 01:15:42,694
I don't believe it.

585
01:15:42,788 --> 01:15:44,029
What do you think, Chief?

586
01:15:44,498 --> 01:15:45,989
Doesn't look good at all.

587
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:48,120
- Let's take a closer look.
- Let's do it.

588
01:15:55,092 --> 01:15:58,460
So all of this makes
no goddamn sense to me.

589
01:15:59,013 --> 01:16:02,632
Oh really? Don't you have such
cases in Long Island?

590
01:16:02,808 --> 01:16:05,391
I thought you had already
seen pretty much everything there.

591
01:16:05,519 --> 01:16:07,761
We have too. But this
here is something completely different.

592
01:16:07,897 --> 01:16:09,763
It happens here every few years.

593
01:16:09,899 --> 01:16:12,312
The craziest deaths,
you can imagine.

594
01:16:13,069 --> 01:16:15,982
Maybe there is
some kind of ghost is up to mischief,

595
01:16:16,072 --> 01:16:19,406
On the other hand, it could also be
that the drinking water here is contaminated.

596
01:16:19,950 --> 01:16:23,159
I've been doing this job
for around twelve years now,

597
01:16:23,662 --> 01:16:26,621
and the most unusual
crimes always happen here.

598
01:16:27,083 --> 01:16:29,700
There must be a logical
explanation for this.

599
01:16:30,461 --> 01:16:35,206
Logical? The guy on the bed
was slashed from back to front.

600
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:38,334
His ribs were split open,
as if it were hunting season.

601
01:16:38,427 --> 01:16:40,043
Not to mention
of the fact that the mattress,

602
01:16:40,137 --> 01:16:42,925
on which he was lying is completely undamaged
apart from the bloodstains.

603
01:16:43,015 --> 01:16:45,223
Maybe he cut himself with
cut himself with his razor.

604
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:48,222
The victim is said to have accomplished the superhuman
feat,

605
01:16:48,312 --> 01:16:51,100
to fillet your own body with
with a razor?

606
01:16:52,149 --> 01:16:54,061
Before or after
he scalped himself?

607
01:16:54,902 --> 01:16:56,109
That's nonsense.

608
01:16:56,362 --> 01:16:59,400
Apart from that, what about the
other three bodies we found,

609
01:16:59,532 --> 01:17:02,195
one of whom looked
as if her face had been boiled?

610
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:05,698
I won't be able to sleep tonight
not be able to sleep tonight.

611
01:17:06,205 --> 01:17:09,539
What about the owner of the motel?
Has anyone spoken to him yet?

612
01:17:09,708 --> 01:17:11,745
Yes, he is being looked after.

613
01:17:12,128 --> 01:17:15,212
These deaths are too
cruel, bizarre and too fast.

614
01:17:16,090 --> 01:17:19,549
This will be another one of those
unsolved trap, like all the others.

615
01:17:20,553 --> 01:17:22,169
That doesn't make your work
not pleasant either.

616
01:17:22,263 --> 01:17:24,129
The same applies to everyone else here.

617
01:17:24,932 --> 01:17:27,049
It's called the curse of the Clown Motel.

618
01:17:28,561 --> 01:17:30,928
- That's simply unbelievable.
- Yes, I know.

619
01:17:31,021 --> 01:17:33,513
I've never heard of anything like it.

620
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:37,188
Everything is so strange, I can't even
even describe one of the cases exactly.

621
01:17:37,278 --> 01:17:39,895
- It is absolutely incomprehensible to me.
- Do I understand correctly that...

622
01:18:01,051 --> 01:18:02,258
Mr. Wilson?

623
01:18:04,221 --> 01:18:05,757
Mr. Wilson,

624
01:18:06,974 --> 01:18:10,843
Was there any reason to believe
that one of the men was violent?

625
01:18:11,312 --> 01:18:13,019
No, they were just bankers.

626
01:18:15,524 --> 01:18:17,356
They seemed quite normal to me.

627
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:23,112
On the other hand, you never know,

628
01:18:23,657 --> 01:18:25,865
when an angel mutates into a devil.

629
01:18:31,290 --> 01:18:33,327
I don't know what got into them.

630
01:18:42,843 --> 01:18:44,880
We saw a parked
parked car outside.

631
01:18:45,054 --> 01:18:49,389
A dark station wagon built in 2014.

632
01:18:49,892 --> 01:18:51,303
We have checked it out.

633
01:18:52,645 --> 01:18:54,637
It belongs to an Alma Perez.

634
01:18:55,439 --> 01:18:58,477
Is this a relative
of your employee Ana Perez?

635
01:19:02,821 --> 01:19:04,483
Ana is

636
01:19:05,783 --> 01:19:09,026
Miss Perez's grandmother.

637
01:19:11,372 --> 01:19:14,581
Ana was at an event last night
event organized by her church,

638
01:19:16,168 --> 01:19:18,080
and Alma is somehow

639
01:19:20,005 --> 01:19:21,416
disappeared.

640
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:29,046
Disappeared?

641
01:19:33,686 --> 01:19:36,929
I haven't the faintest idea,
where. If I knew, I would say so.

642
01:19:41,402 --> 01:19:45,237
I'm sure there are a lot of things
that you need to take care of now.

643
01:19:45,948 --> 01:19:47,484
We will now leave you in peace.

644
01:19:48,325 --> 01:19:49,406
All the best.

645
01:20:40,586 --> 01:20:41,793
Johnson?

646
01:20:43,547 --> 01:20:45,004
Clem Wilson.

647
01:20:47,217 --> 01:20:49,755
Do you still have the guy
who wants to buy the motel?

648
01:20:51,013 --> 01:20:52,675
Tell him it's his.

649
01:20:56,977 --> 01:20:58,218
One dollar.

650
01:20:59,229 --> 01:21:00,765
No, I'm not taking the piss.

651
01:21:02,274 --> 01:21:03,390
One dollar.

652
01:21:04,818 --> 01:21:06,354
Draw up the contract.

653
01:21:17,706 --> 01:21:20,915
Our people and our tribal area
deserve so much more

654
01:21:20,959 --> 01:21:22,746
than this run-down motel.

655
01:21:23,128 --> 01:21:25,336
Our people deserve
justice towards them,

656
01:21:25,464 --> 01:21:28,002
who took advantage of us
then and now.

657
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:31,088
That is why the Chindi
must never be stopped.

658
01:21:31,595 --> 01:21:33,962
Someone must continue the fight
for our ancestors.

659
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:37,929
Perhaps something
stopped him. Is that possible?

660
01:21:39,269 --> 01:21:42,808
How are you supposed to stop a
Chindi, Ana? How?

661
01:21:59,665 --> 01:22:00,746
Out!

662
01:22:13,929 --> 01:22:14,919
Toko?
