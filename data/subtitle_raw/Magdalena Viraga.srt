1
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,100
Cigarette?

2
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,010
There's no smoking in here.

3
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:00,933
What is it that you like
better than anything else?

4
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:07,370
I like being where I am.

5
00:04:16,473 --> 00:04:18,023
And where are you?

6
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,453
I'm not here.

7
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,363
I'm very careful about that.

8
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,823
No, I'm not here.

9
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,640
It is very pleasant.

10
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,893
Very pleasant, indeed, not to be here.

11
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,730
I know what you mean.

12
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:39,870
Your name is Magdelena Viraga,

13
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,513
and that is what you
mean by not being here.

14
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,050
I'm afraid,

15
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:49,357
very much afraid that you are mistaken.

16
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,173
Hey, Ida, Ida,

17
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,960
kiss my ribs.

18
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,313
- Look at the chair.
- Which chair?

19
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:24,570
The only chair.

20
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,313
I can't see the only chair.

21
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,350
Look at the only chair.

22
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,113
There is no chair there.

23
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:09,513
Which one is going to murder which one?

24
00:11:37,376 --> 00:11:38,376
Thank you.

25
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,710
If I'm an officer,

26
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,073
and I am an officer,

27
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:14,433
I'm an officer and I give orders.

28
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,320
Would you,

29
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:19,283
would you like to see me giving orders?

30
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,560
And if I gave orders,

31
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:25,823
and everyone obeyed me,

32
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:28,790
and they do,

33
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,690
would that impress you?

34
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,803
I know you like me,

35
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,120
otherwise you would not even look at me.

36
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,840
Yes and no.

37
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,313
You see, I do look at you
but that is not enough.

38
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,830
I look at you and you look at me,

39
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,290
but we neither say more then how are you,

40
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,683
and very well, thank you.

41
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,310
If we do, there's always the question,

42
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,403
what is your name?

43
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,720
And really, if I knew your name,

44
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:07,720
I would not be interested in you.

45
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:08,853
No, I would not.

46
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,360
And if I do not know your name,

47
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:12,940
I could not be interested.

48
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,583
Certainly I could not.

49
00:13:16,523 --> 00:13:18,773
Goodbye now, yes, goodbye.

50
00:13:20,683 --> 00:13:21,683
Goodbye.

51
00:13:23,462 --> 00:13:24,462
Goodbye.

52
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:24,740
I hate working.

53
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,830
I can't stand working.

54
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,860
I hate working.

55
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,760
I hate working.

56
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:30,780
I hate working.

57
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,890
I can't stand working.

58
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,120
I hate working.
- I know.

59
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:35,910
I can't stand working.

60
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,730
I hate working.
- Ida.

61
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,130
I can't stand working.

62
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,340
Everyone is sick of your whining.

63
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,483
We are two sisters who are not sisters.

64
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:23,113
We are two sisters who are orphans.

65
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,440
We are two sisters who are not sisters

66
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:34,160
because we have not had the
same mother or the same father.

67
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,340
But because we are both orphans,

68
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:38,750
we are two sisters who are not sisters.

69
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,250
He's dead.

70
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:25,530
Who's dead.

71
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,640
He's murder dead, that man.

72
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:30,650
Which man?

73
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,840
That man up there.

74
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:36,200
He's..
- He's dead now.

75
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:37,210
Dead.

76
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:40,190
Where is he now?

77
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:45,420
He's still there

78
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:46,453
in Ida's room.

79
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:48,810
Ida.

80
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:53,210
Ida did

81
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,220
kill him?

82
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:58,143
I don't know.

83
00:24:58,153 --> 00:25:03,153
I don't know.

84
00:25:07,154 --> 00:25:09,362
Let's go and have a drink.

85
00:25:09,372 --> 00:25:10,539
Yeah, let's.

86
00:25:12,233 --> 00:25:13,483
Let's go now.

87
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,713
Yes, let's go home now.

88
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:27,637
Which one was murdered, which one?

89
00:25:30,532 --> 00:25:31,782
I don't know which one.

90
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,393
Maybe the tall one.

91
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,230
The tall one with longest hair.

92
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:45,453
Oh yeah, that one.

93
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,920
That one.

94
00:25:51,367 --> 00:25:53,410
All areas begin count.

95
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,550
All areas begin count.

96
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:59,400
Deputy Craft, 1021, first CC.

97
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:01,823
Deputy Craft 1021, first CC.

98
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:09,440
- I dream that I often..
- What?

99
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:12,373
I dream that I often long for water.

100
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,760
I dream that when I close my eyes,

101
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:19,923
I see water.

102
00:28:23,787 --> 00:28:25,735
I dunno.

103
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:28,995
When I close my eyes, I do see water.

104
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:31,693
What is water?

105
00:28:37,547 --> 00:28:38,547
Ida.

106
00:28:43,037 --> 00:28:44,037
Ida

107
00:28:48,611 --> 00:28:49,611
Ida.

108
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:04,043
Look at me now and here I am.

109
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,880
492, you wanna go to mass?

110
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:19,960
What?

111
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:20,941
It's Sunday.

112
00:29:20,951 --> 00:29:22,000
You wanna go to mass?

113
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:51,050
Pray for us.

114
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:53,846
In the name of St. Peter.

115
00:29:53,856 --> 00:29:55,520
Pray for us.

116
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:56,880
Oh Lord,

117
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:58,360
King of King's,

118
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:00,540
Holy savior of man,

119
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:01,797
son of the father.

120
00:30:02,757 --> 00:30:04,714
Pray for us.

121
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:42,083
Look at me now and here I am.

122
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,240
What is that thing inside you?

123
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:17,370
Private.

124
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:20,563
What is that private thing?

125
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,100
Tell me.

126
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,793
That private thing is only you.

127
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:28,810
Tell me.

128
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,480
I wanna know.

129
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:34,490
I wanna know.

130
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:39,543
What is that private locked up thing?

131
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:41,920
Locked up.

132
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,103
My female self.

133
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,023
Is locked up inside.

134
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:53,080
Locked up.

135
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:54,090
Locked up.

136
00:37:01,101 --> 00:37:02,660
Did you kill her?

137
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:03,670
Yes or no.

138
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:09,173
Wait and see.

139
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:22,090
Water clear.

140
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,100
Water.

141
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,320
What is water?

142
00:37:29,866 --> 00:37:30,866
Ida

143
00:38:02,265 --> 00:38:03,855
You're under arrest, let's go.

144
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:05,378
Let's go.

145
00:38:05,388 --> 00:38:07,220
Move it, let's go.

146
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:08,480
Move, let's go.

147
00:38:34,967 --> 00:38:36,328
Move, move.

148
00:38:36,338 --> 00:38:37,772
Come on.

149
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:40,081
Let's go, come on.

150
00:38:44,221 --> 00:38:46,660
Out of the way, everybody.

151
00:39:03,881 --> 00:39:05,964
Slowly, slowly, slowly.

152
00:40:25,478 --> 00:40:27,178
She has been living and working.

153
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,510
She has been quiet and working.

154
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,270
She has been suffering and working.

155
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:37,063
She has been watching and working.

156
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,240
She has been waiting.

157
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:41,373
She has been working.

158
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:44,173
She has been waiting and working.

159
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,433
She has not needing to be changing.

160
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:08,040
Once I was in love with a man.

161
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:14,163
Every man is different
from every other man.

162
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:18,270
I was so in love with him,

163
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,223
I wanted to die from loving him.

164
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:25,650
I wanna know.

165
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,960
I wanna tell you

166
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:30,990
Tell me.

167
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:35,203
I was feeling all tied inside.

168
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,200
And then?

169
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:53,657
I wanna love someone
and I don't know what to do.

170
00:42:46,766 --> 00:42:48,425
All right, 10-4.

171
00:43:30,265 --> 00:43:32,962
All right,

172
00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:34,483
How often do you have your hotel full?

173
00:46:35,867 --> 00:46:36,990
Not very often.

174
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Why?

175
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:42,811
What do you want?

176
00:46:42,821 --> 00:46:44,200
I was just asking your wife

177
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:46,160
how often you have your hotel full?

178
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:47,810
Quite often.

179
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:49,970
Well, wait a while and I will leave

180
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,403
and everyone will come.

181
00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:54,600
But while I am here,

182
00:46:54,610 --> 00:46:55,770
nobody will come

183
00:46:56,770 --> 00:46:57,770
or go.

184
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:01,651
Well, wait a while,

185
00:47:01,661 --> 00:47:04,980
and I will leave and everyone will come.

186
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:07,053
But while I am here, nobody will.

187
00:47:08,990 --> 00:47:09,990
Why not?

188
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:14,423
Because I want to be
in the hotel all alone.

189
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:18,470
I only want you and your wife

190
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,130
and your three boys and your girl

191
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:24,350
and your father and your
mother and your sister.

192
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:25,563
Nobody else.

193
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:28,464
But do not worry.

194
00:47:28,474 --> 00:47:30,433
You'll not have to keep the others out.

195
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:33,520
They will not come when I am here.

196
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,910
You know that wife of the hotel
keeper with a sweet voice,

197
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:12,743
the one who manages everything?

198
00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:17,534
she will kill herself and
the hotel will go to pieces.

199
00:48:46,864 --> 00:48:48,390
Manager.

200
00:49:20,436 --> 00:49:21,446
He's dead.

201
00:49:33,206 --> 00:49:34,843
I feel that same way, that I'm here.

202
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:37,490
Full name please?

203
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:38,523
David Usher.

204
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:40,640
Address.

205
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:42,233
848 South Main Street.

206
00:49:43,550 --> 00:49:44,580
Phone.

207
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:47,500
458-4587.

208
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:48,600
Age.

209
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:49,777
43.

210
00:49:49,787 --> 00:49:50,721
You work here?

211
00:49:50,731 --> 00:49:52,620
Yes, I'm the hotel manager.

212
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:53,618
How long?

213
00:49:53,628 --> 00:49:55,399
Oh, a couple of years.

214
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:56,460
Where is your apartment?

215
00:49:56,470 --> 00:49:57,670
Just across the hall.

216
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:00,400
You say you found the body?

217
00:50:00,410 --> 00:50:01,410
Yes.

218
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:04,890
Why'd you knock on
the door in the first place?

219
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:05,996
I heard some noises

220
00:50:06,006 --> 00:50:08,300
so I thought I ought to investigate so

221
00:50:09,290 --> 00:50:10,880
knocked on the door.

222
00:50:10,890 --> 00:50:11,721
Nobody answered.

223
00:50:11,731 --> 00:50:12,870
So I opened the door,

224
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,634
saw the body

225
00:50:14,644 --> 00:50:17,030
and closed the door and find you guys.

226
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:17,961
Who lives in this room?

227
00:50:17,971 --> 00:50:20,720
Oh, couple of prostitutes, I think.

228
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:22,410
What's their names?

229
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:23,910
I don't know, I'm sorry.

230
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,135
Live here for two years, you don't know?

231
00:50:26,145 --> 00:50:27,810
No, I don't know.

232
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:29,751
Who uses this room?

233
00:50:29,761 --> 00:50:30,933
A prostitute.

234
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:34,220
One or two or three, how many?

235
00:50:34,230 --> 00:50:35,230
Just one.

236
00:50:37,330 --> 00:50:38,390
Her name.

237
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,029
I'm sorry, I don't know.

238
00:50:40,039 --> 00:50:41,247
Can you describe her?

239
00:50:41,257 --> 00:50:44,508
Oh, just medium, medium build.

240
00:50:44,518 --> 00:50:46,340
What do you mean medium build?

241
00:50:46,350 --> 00:50:48,567
Medium, you know.

242
00:50:48,577 --> 00:50:50,410
I have noticed really.

243
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:53,780
Don't pay much attention, do you?

244
00:50:53,790 --> 00:50:55,050
No, I don't.

245
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:56,750
Don't get involved whatsoever.

246
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,680
Why'd you knock on the door?

247
00:50:58,690 --> 00:51:00,140
Just because I heard these noises,

248
00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:02,520
I thought I ought to investigate.

249
00:51:02,530 --> 00:51:03,750
Okay, Mr. Usher,

250
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,483
can you describe exactly
what you saw and heard?

251
00:51:07,570 --> 00:51:09,133
I just heard some noises.

252
00:51:10,539 --> 00:51:12,870
So after a while I thought
I ought to investigate.

253
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,550
So I opened the door,

254
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:15,570
saw the body,

255
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:18,000
closed the door and called you guys.

256
00:51:18,010 --> 00:51:19,060
Okay, Mr. Usher,

257
00:51:19,070 --> 00:51:21,200
we're gonna book you as a material witness.

258
00:51:21,210 --> 00:51:22,860
Wait in the hallway for Mr. Forensic.

259
00:51:22,870 --> 00:51:24,015
Okay.

260
00:51:34,868 --> 00:51:37,804
The humiliation is too deep.

261
00:51:45,484 --> 00:51:46,754
He said it's three miles wide

262
00:51:46,764 --> 00:51:48,431
and one or two deep.

263
00:52:32,810 --> 00:52:34,190
Your penis

264
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:37,603
sewn on you like a medal,

265
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:42,493
all life and feeling departed from it.

266
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:48,633
Soon you will have no voice.

267
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:51,943
So sing now.

268
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:54,940
Now.

269
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:58,700
Or you'll float,

270
00:52:58,710 --> 00:52:59,963
lifeless,

271
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:04,583
swollen with words you never said,

272
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:08,683
swollen with hoarded love.

273
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,117
How mad are you

274
00:54:01,127 --> 00:54:02,227
and how angry are you?

275
00:54:03,367 --> 00:54:05,067
And how long will you be so angry?

276
00:54:06,113 --> 00:54:08,593
I am never angry enough to die.

277
00:54:12,370 --> 00:54:17,058
I am angry enough to kill.

278
00:54:17,068 --> 00:54:19,068
And how angry is that?

279
00:54:23,313 --> 00:54:25,603
That is as angry as the ocean.

280
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:31,793
I am that angry and type.

281
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:35,390
Kiss my lips.

282
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,010
Ida.

283
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:39,130
Kiss my lips again.

284
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:41,260
Kiss my lips,

285
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:43,210
kiss my lips,

286
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:45,030
kiss my lips,

287
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:46,040
kiss my lips.

288
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:29,233
I'm being followed by a man.

289
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:38,873
He comes everywhere.

290
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:50,743
He always comes.

291
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:02,050
He always has got to go.

292
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:34,283
He always says, I've got to go.

293
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:49,440
He always comes

294
00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:50,833
and says, I've got to go.

295
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:12,293
He's not here now.

296
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:29,253
He's nowhere near here now.

297
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:39,923
He can never get near
here or even close, never.

298
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:53,963
Yeah, he got close,

299
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:57,923
but he never really got all the way here,

300
00:57:58,800 --> 00:57:59,800
to here,

301
00:58:00,990 --> 00:58:02,493
here with me here.

302
00:58:16,906 --> 00:58:17,906
Ida?

303
00:58:18,810 --> 00:58:19,810
Yes.

304
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:25,420
Not here,

305
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,273
all the way here,

306
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:31,333
he never got all the way here.

307
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:35,280
Remember that.

308
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:39,821
Okay.

309
01:02:11,830 --> 01:02:14,280
Don't let anyone in here.

310
01:02:14,290 --> 01:02:18,210
Never, ever let anyone
in here except for me.

311
01:02:18,220 --> 01:02:19,790
Are you here?

312
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:22,310
Who said you could even be here?

313
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:25,520
Get out, get out before I call the police

314
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:00,040
Come here.

315
01:03:35,677 --> 01:03:37,313
You know I didn't do it.

316
01:03:38,290 --> 01:03:39,503
Maybe I wanted to.

317
01:03:41,245 --> 01:03:42,745
I know.

318
01:03:46,170 --> 01:03:50,020
I swear to God it wasn't me.

319
01:03:50,030 --> 01:03:52,851
I know.

320
01:03:52,861 --> 01:03:53,861
I know.

321
01:03:58,420 --> 01:03:59,693
Get me out of here.

322
01:04:01,661 --> 01:04:02,661
I know.

323
01:04:04,010 --> 01:04:05,010
I will.

324
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:10,830
Get me out of here.

325
01:04:13,017 --> 01:04:14,517
I know.

326
01:04:15,639 --> 01:04:16,639
I know.

327
01:04:38,780 --> 01:04:39,780
Ida,

328
01:04:41,066 --> 01:04:42,066
I know.

329
01:05:54,039 --> 01:05:57,626
Come on, get up, get up.

330
01:05:57,636 --> 01:05:58,984
Hands behind your back.

331
01:05:58,994 --> 01:06:00,661
Stay still, come on.

332
01:06:04,289 --> 01:06:05,552
Come on.

333
01:06:17,246 --> 01:06:18,069
Out of my way.

334
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:18,903
Get outta the way.

335
01:06:18,913 --> 01:06:20,702
Come on, out of the way.

336
01:06:20,712 --> 01:06:22,629
Out of my way, now, no.

337
01:06:24,050 --> 01:06:26,496
Move, move, come on.

338
01:06:26,506 --> 01:06:27,539
Get outta the way.

339
01:06:27,549 --> 01:06:29,400
Get outta the way, come on.

340
01:06:29,410 --> 01:06:31,117
Move, get out of the way.

341
01:06:31,127 --> 01:06:32,911
Get out of the way.

342
01:06:32,921 --> 01:06:33,921
Move.

343
01:06:35,206 --> 01:06:36,326
Move.

344
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:16,813
So what was all that blood Ida,

345
01:07:18,130 --> 01:07:19,130
all that blood?

346
01:07:21,770 --> 01:07:22,970
Menstrual blood.

347
01:07:23,950 --> 01:07:26,090
All that menstrual blood.

348
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:27,100
That's all.

349
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:56,080
My faith in the God and my mother,

350
01:07:56,090 --> 01:07:58,953
an the blood of my
Father, my son and mother,

351
01:07:58,963 --> 01:08:01,387
son, my son, sons, my son,

352
01:08:03,561 --> 01:08:04,535
Holy Ghost.

353
01:08:04,545 --> 01:08:06,267
My sins, and the Father.

354
01:08:08,056 --> 01:08:09,422
Saints protect, and Jesus.

355
01:08:09,432 --> 01:08:10,680
I have sinned.

356
01:08:10,690 --> 01:08:13,806
In the blood,

357
01:08:13,816 --> 01:08:15,870
Mary Magdalen, my mother,

358
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:17,784
the whore of Jesus,

359
01:08:17,794 --> 01:08:19,667
the blood of the whore.

360
01:08:19,677 --> 01:08:22,323
Jesus, the mother of Jesus

361
01:08:22,333 --> 01:08:24,216
and the blood of the whore, Jesus.

362
01:08:28,835 --> 01:08:30,502
How old are you now?

363
01:09:00,251 --> 01:09:03,385
Hey, how are you?

364
01:09:03,395 --> 01:09:04,562
How you doing?

365
01:09:06,630 --> 01:09:07,454
You okay?

366
01:09:07,464 --> 01:09:09,090
Get away from me.

367
01:09:10,509 --> 01:09:11,555
Shut up.

368
01:09:11,565 --> 01:09:13,166
Shut up.

369
01:09:13,176 --> 01:09:14,301
Shut up, I said.

370
01:09:14,311 --> 01:09:15,720
Shut up.

371
01:09:15,730 --> 01:09:16,730
Shut up!

372
01:09:17,710 --> 01:09:18,829
Shut up.

373
01:09:26,029 --> 01:09:27,230
Leave her alone.

374
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:28,586
Leave her alone.

375
01:10:17,710 --> 01:10:19,620
My veins and nerves

376
01:10:20,620 --> 01:10:22,233
in two knots,

377
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:27,063
my seat in double knots.

378
01:10:32,730 --> 01:10:34,750
The sun is shrunk.

379
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:36,053
The heavens shrunk.

380
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:43,720
Trees wither.

381
01:10:55,750 --> 01:10:58,133
My invisible hatreds joined.

382
01:11:01,180 --> 01:11:03,593
Those who seem remote and separate.

383
01:11:05,370 --> 01:11:07,453
But are greatly together in the deep.

384
01:11:24,270 --> 01:11:28,210
The sex organs are signs
of God's covenant with us.

385
01:11:28,220 --> 01:11:29,883
They are the image of God,

386
01:11:32,770 --> 01:11:34,880
but I don't have to tell you this.

387
01:11:34,890 --> 01:11:36,363
You've studied and you know.

388
01:11:39,270 --> 01:11:41,820
A pussy is just pussy as far as I know.

389
01:11:41,830 --> 01:11:42,830
What?

390
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:01,513
Look at me now and here I am.

391
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:18,263
We are three sisters who are not sisters.

392
01:14:23,490 --> 01:14:25,363
We are three sisters who are orphans.

393
01:14:32,050 --> 01:14:34,680
We are three sisters who are not sisters

394
01:14:34,690 --> 01:14:38,680
because we have not had the
same mother or the same father.

395
01:14:38,690 --> 01:14:40,660
But because we are all orphans

396
01:14:40,670 --> 01:14:43,480
we are three sisters who are not sisters.

397
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:50,223
I'm very, very calm now.

398
01:15:52,107 --> 01:15:53,423
I'm very calm.

399
01:15:55,610 --> 01:15:57,743
Like a river, I am very calm.

400
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:02,653
I guess I just got calm now.

401
01:16:05,230 --> 01:16:07,283
I just got calm, like a river.

402
01:16:09,580 --> 01:16:11,113
I just got so calm now.

403
01:16:17,170 --> 01:16:18,453
Maybe I got calm.

404
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:23,680
Claire?

405
01:16:24,810 --> 01:16:25,810
Yes?

406
01:16:28,810 --> 01:16:30,813
Dear God, let someone love me now.

407
01:16:33,430 --> 01:16:34,733
Dear God, let me love.

408
01:16:44,860 --> 01:16:47,480
Deputy Farino, 10-21,

409
01:16:47,490 --> 01:16:49,403
deputy Farino 10-21.

410
01:17:23,555 --> 01:17:25,389

King of kings.
- Those women weren't joking

468
01:21:17,644 --> 01:21:19,160
when they claimed

469
01:21:19,170 --> 01:21:21,420
that all you have to do to become a witch

470
01:21:21,430 --> 01:21:23,950
is say three times to yourself,

471
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:25,200
I am a witch.

472
01:21:25,210 --> 01:21:26,440
I am a witch.

473
01:21:26,450 --> 01:21:27,613
I am a witch.

474
01:22:17,257 --> 01:22:18,257
No

475
01:22:18,939 --> 01:22:19,939
No!

476
01:22:22,654 --> 01:22:23,705
Stop it.

477
01:22:23,715 --> 01:22:25,276
Shut up.

478
01:22:25,286 --> 01:22:27,881
Woe to the inhabits of the earth.

479
01:22:27,891 --> 01:22:29,801
For my people are foolish

480
01:22:29,811 --> 01:22:32,061
and they have not known me.

481
01:22:40,712 --> 01:22:42,129
Get up.

482
01:22:43,054 --> 01:22:44,054
Get up.

483
01:23:06,574 --> 01:23:07,657
Get in there.

484
01:23:09,602 --> 01:23:10,602
Behave.

485
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:25,320
I'm sorry, but we must execute murderers.

486
01:23:25,330 --> 01:23:26,653
It's absolute policy.

487
01:23:29,350 --> 01:23:31,070
You must be joking.

488
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:32,673
She's guilty of no crime.

489
01:23:43,150 --> 01:23:44,653
I hear my mother crying.

490
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:48,720
She is bringing out a child

491
01:23:51,060 --> 01:23:52,900
and this daughter calls me

492
01:23:53,970 --> 01:23:54,970
now.

493
01:24:50,310 --> 01:24:53,423
The other voices of the
trumpet call me now.

494
01:24:55,410 --> 01:24:58,500
And I say, yes, I am a witch.

495
01:24:58,510 --> 01:25:00,400
I am a witch.

496
01:25:00,410 --> 01:25:01,523
I am a witch.

497
01:26:57,353 --> 01:26:59,823
A hyacinth resembles a rose.

498
01:27:09,740 --> 01:27:11,433
A rose resembles a blossom,

499
01:27:15,660 --> 01:27:17,803
a blossom resembles a calla lily,

500
01:27:23,830 --> 01:27:26,020
a calla lily resembles a jonquil,

501
01:27:29,180 --> 01:27:31,483
and a jonquil resembles a marguerite,

502
01:27:36,030 --> 01:27:38,513
a marguerite resembles a rose in bloom,

503
01:27:43,030 --> 01:27:45,973
a rose in bloom resembles
a lily of the valley,

504
01:27:49,290 --> 01:27:51,873
a lily of the valley resembles a violet,

505
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:56,410
and a violet resembles a bird.
