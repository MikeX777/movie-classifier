Strategy Planning Committee

2
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,757
Section chief's here. Gather round.

3
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,349
Section Chief...

4
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:36,153
Let's get this investigation underway.

5
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,032
Mr. Aoshima, it's not an investigation.

6
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,277
You're right...

7
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,239
Let's get this office relocation underway.

8
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,196
Our new precinct is ready at last.

9
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,598
We only have 3 days to move.

10
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,758
To make it in time for the
opening ceremony

11
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,755
we must be quick and
efficient and get it done.

12
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,235
Such are the orders from on high.

13
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,309
Make your reports.

14
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,235
Cardboard boxing of personal
effects is on schedule.

15
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,235
Phone lines and
data networks are in place.

16
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,510
Okay, casualty status?

17
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,112
Casualties?

18
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:36,436
A traffic bureau member sustained a
finger wound lifting a locker.

19
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,711
He's undergoing treatment.

20
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,155
That's not important.

21
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,671
It's very important.

22
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:50,637
The transfer of vital records
wasn't properly monitored.

23
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,718
Who was responsible?

24
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,752
Community Safety Bureau.

25
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,629
Some records were found
mixed up in the trash.

26
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,634
There must be evidence.

27
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,914
Get forensics on it.
Find who dropped the ball

28
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,679
Aoshima, my lad.

29
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,598
Time's running out.

30
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,519
Let's wrap it up.

31
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,590
Guys, I need an all-out effort to
locate the suspect.

32
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,154
There isn't one.

33
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,710
An all-out effort to execute the office move.

34
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,637
Precinct Relocation Strategy
Planning Committee.

35
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,990
Good job,
Relocation Strategy Superintendent.

36
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,758
Thank you

37
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,912
I'm going to nail this damn thing

38
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:35,156
<Bayside Shakedown 3 Set the Guys Loose>

39
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:35,555
Chief, the tourism bureau's copier
sustained heavy damage.

40
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,711
What the heck...

41
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,672
Damage control. Deploy repair unit.

42
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,835
Huh...

43
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,150
Okay, let's roll!

44
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,475
The Bayside Precinct move is
underway at last.

45
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,873
I wonder if that man's a detective?

46
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,991
Looks like he's running away.

47
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,552
Good morning, everyone.

48
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,597
You can chuck those out.

49
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,594
Thanks, guys.

50
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,116
Ogata, not packed yet? You're behind!

51
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,233
The most behind is you, Chief.

52
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,028
Maybe

53
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,510
Things you want to take, go in here.

54
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,512
Stuff you're dumping, in here.

55
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,598
This is for trash, eh?

56
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,159
That's easy.

57
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,511
I don't need this.

58
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,716
Gross

59
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,512
Kuriyama, shall I start packing for you?

60
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,991
Mashita's old sweater? Oh, well...

61
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,639
Do I need this?

62
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,070
It's up to you to choose.

63
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,751
There it is.

64
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,792
Is that all junk, then?

65
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,112
Seems so.

66
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,190
Untidy guys... never get the girl.

67
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,913
Only take the bare minimum, okay?

68
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,869
One box each to keep costs down, okay?

69
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:23,029
You guys, please have health
check-ups by month's end.

70
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,157
Can these go in your box?
One's not enough.

71
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,516
You've that much stuff?

72
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,829
Of course.

73
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,593
Just chuck it out.

74
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,871
Can't live without 'em, buddy.

75
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,155
Section Chief Aoshima.

76
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,473
How impressive. Pardon me for
being rank-and-file.

77
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,233
Will you help, Ms. Onda?

78
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,149
Some people hold up promotion

79
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,999
Aoshima, my lad!

80
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,713
It's all on schedule, sir.

81
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,670
No, it's your health check-up.
Doc wants you to call.

82
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,110
What for?

83
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,234
Accounts asks if today's
noodles are on expenses?

84
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,111
Noodles?

85
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,158
Of course not. I'll go tell 'em.

86
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,030
The chief's on his way.

87
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,916
What about the doctor?

88
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,836
Tokyo Metropolitan Police
New Bayside Precinct.

89
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,518
Tell me about the new facility.

90
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:34,718
It's close to the airport to
protect visiting dignitaries.

91
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,712
That's what they say.

92
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,157
And close to infrastructure sites
that terrorists might target.

93
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,908
That's what they say.

94
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,075
Wow...

95
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,111
It has the ultimate in
anti-terrorist security systems.

96
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,795
In an emergency,
the entrance and other vital areas.

97
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,555
Detective Bureau

98
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:59,238
can be sealed from intrusion by a
solid metal shield.

99
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,033
That's what they say.

100
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,158
This is where we hold
investigative meetings.

101
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,909
Will there be administrative changes?

102
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:12,710
The chief and deputy are to retire.
It's unknown who'll take over.

103
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,797
That's what they say.

104
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,948
What?

105
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,229
Is that right?

106
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,079
Nobody told me.

107
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,590
The rumor is everywhere.

108
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:27,550
Only a rumor?
You sent a chill down my spine.

109
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,548
A successor was unofficially announced.

110
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:35,470
Then it's a done deal? We're history.

111
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,591
Ms. Onda,
the local bank's reporting a robbery.

112
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,234
At a time like this?

113
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,073
Let's go, Sumire.

114
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,833
Nobody touch my stuff, okay?

115
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,559
Keep working, okay?

116
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,034
For chrissakes...

117
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,514
What a mess he makes!

118
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,917
Goddamn section chief...

119
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,071
What about noodles?

120
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,796
Noodles?

121
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,510
The rookies should learn it's tradition to
eat noodles when we move.

122
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,274
Police H.Q. To all forces.

123
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,673
Reporting a bus hijacking near the
Rainbow Bridge.

124
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,713
One city bus involved, heading west.

125
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:33,916
Chief!

126
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,830
Stop the packing. Let's go.

127
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:37,836
Hey, Kuriyama!

128
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,632
Where's my coat?

129
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,516
Where's my damn coat?

130
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,909
Bayside Precinct, Robbery Division.

131
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,269
This way.

132
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,199
Thank you for coming.

133
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,712
An employee found it open this morning.

134
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,234
The lock isn't broken.

135
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,636
How did they open it?

136
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,831
It can be unlocked through our network.

137
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,071
Anti-theft system?

138
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,032
No alert to the security company, either.

139
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,716
The network was probably cracked.

140
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,109
Another thing.

141
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,753
Nothing was stolen.

142
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,752
Let's wait for forensics.

143
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,556
Wait here, please.

144
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,159
If you open it, steal something,
for chrissakes.

145
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,872
That's the bus.

146
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,194
Let's wait for the higher-ups.

147
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,709
No way.

148
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,598
But we're not armed.

149
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,877
Think of the hostages.

150
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,750
Natsumi, it's dangerous.

151
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,828
They're being held.

152
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,029
Where's the perp?

153
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,154
Gone?

154
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,109
Where did they go?

155
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,032
They left a while ago.

156
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,829
They left?

157
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,913
Are you okay?

158
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,908
How many were there?

159
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,118
Five... wearing masks.

160
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,631
They pulled out knives.

161
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,520
Not knives... scalpels.

162
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,031
Like doctors use.

163
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,874
They made us give up our wallets.

164
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,637
Then they took 'em.

165
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,678
No, they're here.

166
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,788
They left without taking them.

167
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,592
Search outside.

168
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,152
Nobody hurt?

169
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,834
Are you okay?

170
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,314
Hijack a bus so at least steal something.

171
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,752
Official Personnel Only.

172
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,634
Sir, this is the internal affairs bureau.

173
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,668
This place is impervious to any
external threat.

174
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:48,039
Really? But we walked in easily.

175
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,712
Now you mention it...

176
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,279
Strolling around like this,
we must look very suspicious.

177
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,593
Right... how come we got in?

178
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,638
That door's open, too.

179
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,157
That's just asking to be robbed.

180
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,072
What's in there?

181
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,878
Looks interesting...

182
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,550
Yours, too?

183
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,237
And yours?

184
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,629
Mine, yes.

185
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,079
Victimless crimes.

186
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,119
Perfectly executed.

187
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,118
Many similarities, well-coordinated.

188
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,831
But how weird that nothing was stolen.

189
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,555
The crooks gave us a
break because of the relocation.

190
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,114
Not a time to joke.

191
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,035
Careful with my instant ramen supplies

192
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,352
I'll take care of it.

193
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,878
Sorry to trouble you.
Is this criminal affairs?

194
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:26,916
That's right.

195
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,594
Help me, Aoshima.

196
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,838
Anyone seen my coat?

197
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,754
Sorry to bother you.
Section Chief Aoshima?

198
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,189
Have you seen my coat?

199
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,833
Who are you?

200
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,837
Sorry not to say. My name is Waku.

201
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,679
Waku?

202
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,709
Did you say "Waku"?

203
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,912
Your long-term colleague,
Detective Waku

204
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,999
was my father's brother;
in other words, my uncle.

205
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,077
Really?

206
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:00,070
Today I was assigned to
the serious crimes section.

207
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,878
Here's an introductory gift.

208
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:07,189
Guys, he's Mr. Waku's nephew!

209
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,638
Turn to the side.

210
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:22,319
So Mr. Waku's nephew
became a cop, too?

211
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,593
What a coincidence you came here.

212
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:29,679
Superintendent Muroi
suggested I work under you.

213
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,592
He did?

214
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,672
Here's today's schedule.

215
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:46,352
The public safety commissioner will be
here soon. This is the agenda.

216
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,675
National Police Agency
Commissioner-General Secretariat.

217
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,872
Lunch is with the deputy commissioner
and the justice minister.

218
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,235
Which restaurant do you prefer?

219
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,277
I'll talk to the section chief.

220
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,559
We finished the bus hijack survey.

221
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,677
Well done.

222
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,198
No-one saw anything
before or after the crime.

223
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,995
No physical evidence, no prints.

224
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,829
What about your report?

225
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,030
You look busy, I'll e-mail it.

226
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,833
I'm just a trainee.

227
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,348
Here's your health report.

228
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,233
Listen, everyone.

229
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,709
There are similarities with the bank case;
maybe it's the same team.

230
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,751
Right?

231
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,792
Follow up on it.

232
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,749
There are no victims. Let's move office.

233
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,632
I'll have you know...

234
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,997
"All crimes are of equal importance!"

235
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,798
Isn't that right, Mr. Aoshima?

236
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,753
Exactly. Way to go, kid.

237
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:03,990
What's that?

238
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,958
I got this at my uncle's funeral.

239
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,914
Mr. Waku's notebook?

240
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,078
That line was in here.

241
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,153
Want to read it?

242
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,199
Is that okay?

243
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,193
What's all this?

244
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,235
Detective bureau, you're falling behind!

245
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:38,116
Finish up here and move.

246
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,917
Show me later, will you?

247
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:48,271
Aoshima, will you please call the doctor.

248
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,392
I will.

249
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,873
Guys, don't forget health check-ups.
But keep working, though.

250
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,758
Have you drawn-up the night-duty roster?

251
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,790
I will.

252
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,912
It's tough being in charge.

253
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,076
Shall I take over?

254
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:10,637
New equipment is here, everyone!

255
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:15,755
It acts as your security card, too.

256
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:19,191
It'll improve communication
during investigations.

257
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:25,117
You can have open-channel
conversations network-wide.

258
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,352
What a pain to carry two.

259
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,829
Now I don't need to buy a new one.

260
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,628
Some of them have a projector function

261
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:42,029
Aoshima... Aoshima...

262
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,670
Quiet!

263
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,069
Aoshima... Sumire...

264
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,792
Come with me.

265
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,118
Pistols?

266
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,631
Mislaid in the chaos of the move.

267
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,750
You mean lost?

268
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,958
Everyone will find out
but for now it's a secret

269
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,714
3 are missing; yours...

270
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,793
...Chinese trainee, Mr. Wang's, and...

271
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,313
Mine?

272
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,797
Don't tell anyone. It's strictly secret.

273
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,999
No time to talk, let's find 'em.

274
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,236
Send out an alert to catch the thieves.

275
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,674
Precinct Chief!

276
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:20,078
Akiyama, this occurred during
the relocation, right?

277
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,753
Indeed it did, sir.

278
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:26,238
And Inspector Aoshima's responsible
for the relocation, right?

279
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,351
Indeed he is, sir.

280
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,790
Not my responsibility, is it?

281
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,075
Indeed not, sir.

282
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:33,955
Keep it under the carpet
until the move is over.

283
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,358
It'll come to light during the
new chief's watch.

284
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,360
It's only 3 pistols, after all.

285
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:45,793
Grab some confiscated weapons

286
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,352
and hide the loss for the time being.

287
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,713
Nice whitewash, sir.

288
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,837
Don't describe it like that.

289
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,798
Excuse me.

290
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,153
I'm home...

291
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,395
Welcome back.

292
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,276
Here's the receipt.

293
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,399
I bought some snacks.

294
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,229
Not for me, thanks.

295
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,675
Is this real?

296
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:27,711
It's amazing.

297
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,069
Don't touch it.

298
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,199
Can I help at all?

299
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,392
Box this up

300
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,275
3 pistols lost at the Bayside Precinct.

301
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,352
No way? What are the cops doing?

302
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,075
How could that happen?

303
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,839
Fully-loaded, too.

304
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,832
Another police foul-up.

305
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,196
It's totally unforgivable.

306
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,792
We're going to find these weapons,
right?

307
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,991
Access to the gun room is by
serving officers and

308
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,998
...movers. I'll fetch the guy in charge.

309
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:03,916
Let's track down any sketchy characters.

310
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:08,113
"Don't trust hearsay, go see for yourself"
it says here.

311
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,950
Right, get ready to pull an all-nighter.

312
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,318
Can you guys show more enthusiasm?

313
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,752
Not really. We've no experience...

314
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,995
For chrissakes...

315
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,834
We all have to begin somewhere.

316
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,789
Try to kick-off with a bang.

317
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,314
Not literally, Mr. Wang.

318
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,711
What's up, guys?

319
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,270
This smell takes me back

320
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,749
Mashita, what are you doing here?

321
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,836
This place is for demolition, eh?

322
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,917
Still in the negotiations bureau?

323
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,673
Meaning HQ knows about the pistol theft?

324
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,388
I've been let go from negotiations.

325
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,909
What pistol?

326
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,076
It's nothing.

327
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,794
Oh, the pistol thing on the news.

328
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,793
The news?

329
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:15,676
Reporting from the new Bayside Precinct,
still in mid-relocation.

330
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,788
This morning, in response to a
citizen alarmed at an internet report

331
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,155
the Metropolitan Police confirmed

332
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:26,276
the loss of 3 fully-loaded pistols
from the new precinct.

333
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,719
We're busted.

334
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,829
Precinct Chief Kanda is due to
speak at any moment.

335
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,911
He looks tired.
Responsibility is a heavy burden.

336
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,310
No, it's make-up.

337
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,832
And that's acting.

338
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:11,034
Regarding the loss of the pistols during
our move to the new precinct...

339
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,390
I will now make a statement.

340
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:19,989
He's over-doing it.

341
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:28,000
Whether the pistols are lost or not

342
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:32,228
is currently under investigation.

343
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,431
Are they really missing or not?

344
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,314
Is that true or is it not?

345
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,997
Is it or isn't it?

346
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,357
Maybe they are gone,
maybe they aren't gone.

347
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:48,270
It may be true that we don't know,
or that may not be true.

348
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,749
What's he saying?

349
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:53,748
Is it unheard of for guns
to go missing this way?

350
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,912
While extremely rare, it's not impossible.

351
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,355
Were precautions taken?

352
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,439
While extremely rare,
we were fully prepared.

353
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,149
It's more than extremely rare.

354
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,112
How will you assign responsibility?

355
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,675
The issue of responsibility...

356
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,400
as precinct chief...

357
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:34,430
Are you okay, sir?

358
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,829
Our press conference is now over.

359
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,876
How was I?

360
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,714
They're just as my uncle described.

361
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,355
This way.

362
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,876
Here's their main guy

363
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,430
the list of employees...

364
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,956
Who handled internal affairs?

365
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,233
It's here...

366
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,753
This many people?

367
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,992
Including part-timers, we're over 200.
Many from a temp agency.

368
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,230
There are no names here.

369
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:25,430
Temps are given numbers instead.
We communicate via text.

370
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,678
So you don't know their names?

371
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,952
Many give false names anyway.

372
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:49,275
A body's been located on a moored boat

373
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,836
in the Odaiba district of the Bayside ward.

374
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,153
Coastguard has secured the location
and requests police investigation.

375
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,438
A body's been located on a moored boat

376
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:03,919
in the Odaiba district of the Bayside ward.

377
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:09,514
Coastguard has secured the location
and requests police investigation.

378
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,194
It's a long way.

379
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,235
Let's swap.

380
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,833
No way.

381
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:29,153
Mr. Aoshima, welcome back.

382
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,879
What's the registration number?

383
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,433
301

384
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,958
Not mine.

385
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,438
It can't be my fault, can it?

386
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,837
Have you seen my coat?

387
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:56,393
The investigation is now open.

388
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:03,310
We heard of the incident at 8:05 today.
Victim profile?

389
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,991
Kazuhiko Kamimura, 25 years old.

390
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,875
No permanent employer but
registered with a temp agency.

391
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,119
Inquiries reveal he was involved
in the precinct move.

392
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,351
He was working here yesterday.

393
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:21,957
He was shot through the chest.
Death was instant.

394
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:26,273
We checked for prints and witnesses
but have nothing yet.

395
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,512
Regarding the gun that was used

396
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,828
ballistic profiles match those on file.

397
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:36,989
It's one of the guns stolen yesterday.

398
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:45,279
Pardon me for asking,
why is that man standing?

399
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,313
Is it the new precinct chief?

400
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:54,028
What about the theft?

401
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:58,277
Officers moved their own guns,
so it didn't occur in transit.

402
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:02,076
Theft occurred after transport.

403
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:05,875
The gun room opens with a key
and remotely via network.

404
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,237
The network may have been cracked.

405
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,796
Let's have an all-out search to
locate the suspects.

406
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:19,316
Only federal investigators will take part.

407
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,996
Local cops must relocate in time for
the mayor's ceremony in 2 days.

408
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,318
Wait a minute. Let us join in.

409
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,508
They were our guns

410
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,069
Aoshima, sit down.

411
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,878
Our guns killed someone.

412
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,309
That was your fault!

413
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,038
So let us join the investigation.

414
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,198
Silence. We don't need you.
Get on with the move.

415
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,839
That's the kind of work you're fit for.

416
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,918
What do you mean by that?

417
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:48,478
You insisted we build this place for
the non-existent Olympics.

418
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,110
"Be proud of the work of foot-soldiers"

419
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,759
What other work can we do?

420
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,798
You don't know the local area!

421
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,360
Everyone calm down.

422
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,074
I get it.

423
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,510
I know how you feel.

424
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:16,040
Will you leave things with me?

425
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:23,872
Anyway, let's sit back down, shall we?

426
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,109
Okay guys, sit down.

427
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,109
I'm administrative liaison, Torigai.

428
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:02,911
I apologize for any thoughtless words.

429
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:06,835
After consulting the supervisor
and the precinct chief

430
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:10,952
the local precinct will join the investigation.

431
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,760
When the Bayside detectives relocate,
so will they.

432
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,549
Federal and local investigators
will buddy up.

433
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:24,398
How about it, everyone?

434
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,918
Superbly done.

435
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,798
Does he outrank the supervisor?

436
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,191
He's more like an aide.
Probably studied "servant leadership"

437
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,431
Yeah, that servant thing...

438
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,399
Thank you

439
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:59,070
I look forward to working together,
Mr. Aoshima.

440
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:08,077
You studied servant leadership, right?

441
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,792
Yes. Federal and local
cops are always fighting.

442
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,276
So a regulatory role like
mine is necessary.

443
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:21,318
Federal and local cops think different,
act different.

444
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:26,510
They need steering
towards the same goal.

445
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:31,797
I appraise their relative strengths
and balance them.

446
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,313
What did you say to the higher-ups?

447
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,478
I suggested the supervisor
make use of you locals.

448
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:47,071
I told the precinct chief, teaming with the
feds would be good politics.

449
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:53,236
It's all about calculation.
And using what's at hand.

450
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,874
I see. Mr. Muroi doesn't think on that level.

451
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,156
I wonder about him.

452
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,318
Placing too much faith in the local precincts.

453
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:11,395
It's a romantic notion but not exactly smart.

454
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,112
Hello

455
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,918
Thanks for letting us in.

456
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:30,150
You're the landlord, aren't you?

457
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,434
Is something up?

458
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,990
Nothing much...

459
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,470
Since I got the sudden call, I did wonder.

460
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,872
I bet You were surprised.

461
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,239
A computer says a lot about someone.

462
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,152
What are all those files?

463
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,357
Game files... 148 of them.

464
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,232
Chat software, too.

465
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:18,508
He's into MMORPG's,
massive multiplayer games.

466
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,158
I see...

467
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,311
Our suspect is addicted to online games.

468
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,798
Mr. Aoshima...

469
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,519
This is for you.

470
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,996
Please Do It today.

471
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,037
Chief?

472
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:54,594
Mr. Aoshima? Sign this, please

473
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,475
Aoshima, lad... did you call the doc?

474
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,949
I know.

475
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,435
I need next month's budget.
You're section chief now.

476
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,956
Don't fob me off.

477
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,836
Relocation supervisor, please sign this.

478
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,198
Done already?

479
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:17,876
This is the security system manual.

480
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:22,233
So this is the new place? Smells so fresh.

481
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:27,075
You're from the traffic bureau...

482
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:30,278
I'm Taguchi.

483
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:34,872
I was in the TV show,
"Police Negotiator", it's great.

484
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,429
Who are you?

485
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,073
I can't reveal that yet.

486
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,356
Excuse us.

487
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,512
Don't you know it? It was huge on cable.

488
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,839
Wait a moment...

489
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,033
Bring the mislaid boxes to the
detective bureau, please.

490
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,869
Sort out your desks
then let's hit the investigation!

491
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:01,351
Mr. Aoshima, found your coat?

492
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:04,233
Mr. Aoshima, your box arrived.

493
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,590
Here's the manual for the security system.

494
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:13,352
That whole emergency stronghold thing,
right?

495
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,875
I think you should read it.

496
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,395
It's huge...

497
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,996
Young Mr. Waku...

498
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,236
Study hard.

499
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,839
Yes, sir.

500
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:41,073
Wow, is this the new investigative bureau?

501
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,198
You guys are...

502
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,869
Kuroda of the traffic bureau.

503
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,834
Here's a DVD of a show I was in.

504
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,231
Check it out.

505
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,597
I was the police advisor.

506
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,988
Hello there. Long time, no see.

507
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,518
You're all negotiators?

508
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,833
So many of you?

509
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,194
Young Mr. Koike!

510
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,878
You negotiate now?

511
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,599
Why are you here?

512
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:22,557
Former department chief...

513
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,154
Department Chief...

514
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,478
He ditched the glasses.

515
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:33,598
The victim has logged 10,000 hours
on "Battle of Combat"

516
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,150
There's a community page

517
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:41,600
on which gamers can chat as they play.

518
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,439
I'm accessing it now.

519
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,031
Anyone want to play?

520
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,235
I'll read it out. "Hello"

521
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,590
"Who are you?"

522
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,553
"Anyone know this guy?"

523
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:03,835
"I'm Shiora's friend.
Heard about the killing?"

524
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:04,950
"So what?"

525
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,599
"Who are you?"

526
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,877
"Any of Shiora's friends here?"

527
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,029
"Why?"

528
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:13,078
"Guys, ignore him"

529
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,072
"Leave him alone"

530
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,270
"I'm a friend of Shiora's"

531
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,031
"What's up, Wild Dog?"

532
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,878
"I'll send you the server. Let's chat direct"

533
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:22,557
Hi, there.

534
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:27,516
What's your name and job?

535
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,194
I'm with internal affairs...

536
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,919
He's requesting voice chat.

537
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,439
Here it is.

538
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,278
Wild Dog?

539
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,275
You're a policeman, right?

540
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:51,153
I need your help.
I want to ask about Shiora.

541
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:57,393
Did he have any enemies?
Any recent trouble online?

542
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,556
I was waiting for you.

543
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,076
I got a message for you.

544
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:07,114
There are 2 more guns.

545
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,637
Was it you who stole them?

546
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:17,070
A crap security system like that won't do.

547
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,309
Bastard

548
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:21,557
He's accessing through a proxy
relayed via the Philippines.

549
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,918
Proxy settings leave no blog.
We can't get an address.

550
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,918
Hey, Wild Dog...

551
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:33,837
If you don't meet my demands,
the other 2 guns will soon get busy.

552
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,516
What are the demands?

553
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:41,988
I've put a file on the server.
Download it from the URL.

554
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,510
It's done. Printing now.

555
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:02,313
I'll read them out.

556
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,595
"To the Bayside Precinct"

557
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,598
"Set the guys loose"

558
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,032
National Police Agency.

559
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,236
The release of inmates?

560
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:25,589
If not, the stolen guns
will be used indiscriminately.

561
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:30,073
Online game buddies,
right? It's just a prank.

562
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:33,073
Below the mugshots are 2 numbers.

563
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,590
The registration numbers of the 2 pistols.

564
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,349
What do you think, Muroi?

565
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:42,314
The investigation's just begun.
We wait until it's complete.

566
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,508
But we don't yield to their demands.

567
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:51,910
We didn't fly you back from the
provinces for a textbook reply.

568
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,513
I told you, I'm too busy.

569
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,951
The doctor made the trip himself.

570
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,588
Here he is. Get in.

571
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,316
Thank you, Doctor.

572
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:15,194
It's something important. Sit.

573
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,875
Mr. Shunsaku Aoshima...

574
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:23,639
I thought it best to talk directly
about your check-up results.

575
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:28,314
There may be a serious issue.

576
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,633
Please look at this.

577
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:33,913
A half-inch shadow here.

578
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:35,348
Shadow?

579
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,150
Is it a tumor?

580
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:43,673
We don't know without a follow-up.
But if it is malignant...

581
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,628
Malignant?

582
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:50,396
You should see a specialist
at a major facility.

583
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:54,155
I'll write a referral.
Please don't waste any time.

584
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:56,193
Okay?

585
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:27,398
I'm sure it's nothing.

586
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:34,438
Chief, investigation supervisor is
asking for you.

587
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:41,112
Chief... Chief...

588
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:48,512
Why is the suspect demanding the
release of your arrestees?

589
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:55,558
You arrested all these, right?

590
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,471
Get the car, please.

591
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:12,912
Mr. Aoshima...

592
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:15,633
Are you okay?

593
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:19,354
Drive me again, please.

594
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:32,639
Mr. Aoshima?

595
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:34,678
It's a secret though.

596
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:40,473
He's got a lump, this big.

597
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:45,273
But don't tell anyone.

598
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:49,598
Of course. I'll keep silent

599
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,118
Aoshima?

600
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:58,311
Just between you and me.

601
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:01,592
He doesn't have much longer.

602
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,389
No way? Where did you hear it?

603
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:10,630
Doctor told him directly.
A matter of months, apparently.

604
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:23,359
The chief did look pale.

605
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:25,949
Really? Oh, dear...

606
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:31,354
He's been coughing a lot.
Soon gets out of breath, too.

607
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,431
I thought it was strange.

608
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:48,070
Central Medical Detention Center.

609
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,674
Gather the inmate records, please.

610
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:41,949
You are Manami Hyuga, right?

611
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,033
Mr. Aoshima?

612
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:50,200
You talk to her, please.

613
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:00,351
There's been an incident.

614
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,113
We received a demand from the suspect.

615
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,108
To free these guys.

616
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,191
I want your opinion.

617
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:19,389
Why does he want you all to be freed?

618
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,228
What does he want with you?

619
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:29,035
When will my death
sentence be carried out?

620
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:34,118
How many years must I wait?

621
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:38,669
That's not up to us.

622
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:44,438
You got life imprisonment, anyway.

623
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:11,230
Best not to look her in the eyes.

624
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,956
That's a beautiful picture.

625
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:29,435
You're section chief now, huh?

626
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:35,199
How do you know?

627
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:38,235
But you're not well.

628
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:46,114
Maybe the new job's too taxing?

629
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,589
Want me to operate on you?

630
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,194
Didn't eat yet, huh?

631
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:00,392
Everyone's exhausted from the relocation.

632
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:05,271
Ogata's flat out on the sofa,
sleeping like the dead.

633
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:07,473
Like the dead?

634
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:11,630
Sorry... not like the dead at all.

635
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:19,749
Hope our pistols don't get used.

636
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:28,148
Mr. Wang claims he's not bothered
but he's depressed, too.

637
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:35,149
If someone gets hurt with my gun

638
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,709
I'll just want to die.

639
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,593
To die?

640
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:45,199
Sorry, you mustn't think of dying.

641
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,192
You know...

642
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:58,556
Forget it. It's nothing.

643
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,398
Eat up

644
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:21,433
I haven't eaten all day. This is to die for.

645
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:24,628
Don't mention dying!

646
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:33,516
Aoshima...

647
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,391
Forget it.

648
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:43,398
Seafood kimchi ramen, unusual, eh?

649
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:46,392
Is the shelf life okay?

650
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:51,995
Shelf life...

651
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:55,958
I wonder about mine...

652
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:06,279
Actually...

653
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,673
To tell the truth...

654
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,197
Nah...

655
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:25,595
Maybe there's something I had to tell you.

656
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,632
What was it?

657
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:42,714
There's something I never told you

658
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,072
Aoshima...

659
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,673
What?

660
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:20,953
Justify people's faith in you.

661
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:24,988
If you know what I mean.

662
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:39,752
Are you releasing them?

663
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:43,712
We won't act unless we understand.

664
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:46,238
You want my motive?

665
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:50,713
It's not that people cause crimes...

666
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:53,597
Alright...

667
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:56,792
I like researching past crimes

668
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:03,669
I realized that superior criminals
encounter superior cops.

669
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:07,999
So the criminals Aoshima caught are a
cut above the rest.

670
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:11,830
I thought it'd be cool to
let them loose again.

671
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:13,912
A criminal geek, huh?

672
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:17,354
Let me set a limit on my offer.

673
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:23,958
The show begins tomorrow at midnight.

674
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:27,352
Indiscriminate killing.

675
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:31,230
You jerk. We won't swallow that!

676
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:32,270
Supervisor!

677
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:36,434
What did you do?

678
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,631
Hey, Wild Dog?

679
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:46,952
It's mine.

680
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:48,396
It's mine, right?

681
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:49,834
You didn't pull the trigger.

682
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:04,599
Mine's next...

683
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:15,549
The dinner's at Daruma.

684
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:21,437
Chief, I have an update on Aoshima.

685
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:23,432
I know. It's severe, huh?

686
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,830
I got it from public affairs. In confidence.

687
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:27,308
The span of a life.

688
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:28,270
Pardon?

689
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:32,672
Living life that fast,
I figured he wouldn't last.

690
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:37,713
The doctor called.
He re-checked the x-ray.

691
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,958
The shadow was just a
problem with the film.

692
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:43,396
Aoshima's not ill after all.

693
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:45,392
Heck, really?

694
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:49,388
We must hurry and tell him.
Poor guy's lost his gusto.

695
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:51,596
Lost his gusto, has he?

696
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:53,995
Totally down in the dumps.
Hardly the same guy.

697
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,436
Lost his gusto, huh?

698
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:56,953
I'll go tell him.

699
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:58,588
No need.

700
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:10,753
A gusto-less Aoshima
may be less of a nuisance.

701
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:12,878
I see your point.

702
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:16,829
He always quarrels with the feds
and we take the heat.

703
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:20,271
A gusto-less Aoshima may be just right.

704
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,277
But sir...

705
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:25,592
We won't tell him. He's to stay sick.

706
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:37,313
Here are the mislaid boxes
you asked about.

707
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:39,391
Thanks

708
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:49,950
Mr. Aoshima, shall I sort this out for you?

709
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:57,791
How come the 2nd victim worked
for the removals company?

710
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:01,995
Is it a serial mover murder case?

711
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:05,835
Sorry to bother you.

712
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:09,478
Investigation meeting in 5 mins.

713
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:12,552
Kuriyama, did you hear that?

714
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:14,910
Mr. Wang, You understand?

715
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:16,435
Sorry

716
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:20,428
Chief, are you okay?

717
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:24,269
Sorry, I feel lousy. I'll skip the meeting.

718
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:33,879
Is he okay?

719
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:41,877
Aoshima...

720
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:49,029
Pull yourself together.
It was my gun that was used

721
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:52,956
I feel so sick...

722
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:55,032
I'm in pain, too.

723
01:00:55,440 --> 01:01:00,560
Not mentally... physically.

724
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:04,480
Where I was shot.

725
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:08,476
It's throbbing.

726
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:13,554
Join the investigation.

727
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,911
Forget it.

728
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:20,835
You're dying anyway.

729
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:28,672
I know that you're ill
and running out of time.

730
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:31,394
And so what?

731
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:40,793
In that case live to the fullest.

732
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:45,312
Value the remaining time.

733
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:51,033
Live out your life in true Aoshima style!

734
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:04,916
Don't let the suspect use your gun.

735
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:15,035
Please give it back
Mr. Waku wrote amazing stuff!

736
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,668
Be careful with it.

737
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:18,872
What does this mean?

738
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:21,429
Natsumi, what do you think?

739
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:23,278
Which one?

740
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:27,872
"When your life's on the line
then you really live"

741
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:31,279
What does that mean?

742
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:34,393
It's hard to make sense of.

743
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:38,550
Mr. Aoshima,
you should sort through this
