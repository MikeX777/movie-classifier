00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,780
Just try to paint over me.

Putain! Bande de puceaux!#

22
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,955
I feel so relieved!

23
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,136
You've dropped something!

00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,866
No problem!
I've thrown it away!

00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,482
What are you celebrating?

32
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,351
What party is this?

33
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,302
Is there something nice?

34
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,679
- How old are you?
- 20!

35
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,440
Isn't this boring for a
20year old guy?

36
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,073
Politics are interesting!

37
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,813
What are you doing?
Is this a funeral?

38
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,608
How old are you?

39
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,332
Aren't you young fellows bored here?

40
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,990
What's that? You get it?

41
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,292
Is it a man?

42
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,735
Or a woman?

43
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,913
- A human being.
- But you distinguish betwen mand and woman!

44
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,793
I got it!

45
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,389
How old are you?

46
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,911
- 100.
- 100?

47
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,236

48
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,358
0 Years? Nice thought!

49
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,425
- Where are you from?
- Can't remember...

50
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,550
- And what are you doing here?
- Go into this form.

51
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,990
- For sleeping? Hooray!
- Not for sleeping!

52
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,599
- For what then?
- To fit into it.

53
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,312
Why would a man want to fit into
a human-form? Bullshit!

54
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,665
- Some will let me inside.
- Shall I?

55
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,600
Would you do that?

56
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,836
Sure! I'm a woman!

57
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,841
Let's find uns a cosy place!

58
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,585

- I Don't need it.

59
00:08:42,852 --> 00:08:44,429
I've got you now!

60
00:08:45,449 --> 00:08:46,435
Let's go!

61
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,417
Nice mood!!
You're very good!

62
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,396
- Let's move into the middle!
- Here's the heart!

63
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,655
No way! In the middle!

64
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,450
Come on!

65
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,150
Hey!

66
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,309
Bust: 102.
Hips: 93.

67
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,576
I had my first period with 14.
Now I am 18.

68
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,101
Even after this advertisement you
don't want to be a real man, huh?

69
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,755
I'm still a man. I'm still alive.

70
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,501
Then come over here and proof it!

71
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,317
Don't disturb us!

72
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,435
Bastards!

73
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,619
My heart will be broken...

74
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,079
Stand up!
Let's find a real bed!

75
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,344
Come on! They are Yakuza!
They are dangerous!

76
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,448
Stop staring at me! Piss off!

77
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,606
How mean! Hands off my man!

78
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,901
You wanna be killed?

79
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,932
He is nuts!

80
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,200
Tell me! You don't prefer men, do you?

81
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,322
Stop following us!

82
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,195
- What's this?
- None of your business!

83
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,918
You kill people with that?

84
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,429
Do you belong to the other gang?

85
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,443
- You got rifles too?
- Of course!

86
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,833
Idiot!
Now they've seen it!

87
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,810
Let's take the girl and the maniac then!

88
00:12:28,599 --> 00:12:29,747
I'm coming.

89
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,309
How sad!
Where are we going?

90
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,518
- To a place full of men.
- Wow!! Great!!

91
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,719
I've never seen him!

92
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,642
- Tidy up!
- Yes, Sir!

93
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,873
I wanna pee!

94
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,316
I'll pee here if you don't
let me go out!

95
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:04,995
Got it?

96
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,598
How long will we stay here?

97
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,460
Until tomorrow! You mustn't go
until the sun rises!

98
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,400
Until your war with the
rifles is over?

99
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,626
It's not a war! We're just
killing each other!

100
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,353
I tell you: I'm going to pee. OK?

101
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,568
Just do it!

102
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,782
Bullshit!

103
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,521
No Bullshit!

104
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,994
Bullshit! Nobody here can kill!

105
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,405
Huh? What are you talking about?

106
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,478
- "Pee..."
- Stop it!

107
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,757
You're not the type for it!
You can't kill!

108
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,033
- Bastard!
- "Pee..."

109
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,268
I'm not wearing a panty!
I'm just going to pee!

110
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,995
"Pee..."

111
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,348
Slut!

112
00:17:02,305 --> 00:17:04,589
I can see it!
You guys can't kill!

113
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,711
Don't get it wrong!

114
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,233
- "Pee..."
- You can't kill!

115
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,154
You'll see! I cut you down!

116
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,309
Got it? I'll kill you!

117
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,198
You can't!

118
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,912
"Pee..."

119
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,355
- One more step and you're dead!
- "Pee..."

120
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,396
- Just go on!
- "Pee...!"

121
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,090
What's going on?

122
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,380
I wanna pee!

123
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,595
Come!

124
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,073
- Hello!
- Hello!

125
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,199
- You wanna watch? You're welcome!
- I want to ask you for something...

126
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,511
For a man I do everything!

127
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,364
- Can you hold it? I wanna come inside.
- You know what you want!

128
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,830
- Thank you.
- My pleasure!

129
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:49,509
Nobody else wanna do it.
I'ts hurting me.

130
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,596
- Are there any rifles?
- Rifles?

131
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,990
You didn't come for me?

132
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,731
- Bye bye.
- They won't allow kids!!

133
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,916
I wanna steal a rifle!

134
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,240
And why here?

135
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,760
Idiot! I've seen the backup!

136
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,359
Why backup?

137
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,760
Idiot! Because the gang's too small!

138
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,160
Then why are they fighting?

139
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,510
Idiot!! It's their job!

140
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,268
They could fight for women!

141
00:19:17,388 --> 00:19:19,231
Idiot! It's for power

142
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,590
- Don't you know Yakuza-Films?
- Nope!

143
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,205
If I help you, will you
spend time with me?

144
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:29,995
Come on!

145
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,647
Woops! Sorry!

146
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,849
Pardon us!

147
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,989
Forget it! Why would you want
to shoot a rabbit anyway?

148
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,125
It's not about animals!

149
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,631
Whatever! Now about me ...!

150
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,195
- How old are you?
- 17.

151
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,123
Stop it! I'm going to find one!

152
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,190
Help me!

153
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:01,633
- Who are you?!
- Don't make such a face!

154
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,269
- I just went peeing...
- And the boy?

155
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,050
He wants to steal rifles!

156
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,915
- Which gang are you?!
- I'm just a student!

157
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:27,670
- Must be a lie!
- Look ... my student ID ...

158
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,843
Please! I want a rifle!

159
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,356
Something will happen tomorrow!

160
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,284
I wanna shoot somebody!

161
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,840
- You are nuts ...
- May I join you?

162
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,633
Bullshit! This is not a game!

163
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,997
What? Maybe there are no rifles?

164
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,160
You only got swords and daggers
like in the old times?

165
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,162
What kind of Yakuza are you?
You've already lost!

166
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,155
Stop!

167
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,673
You are going to stay! With the girl!

168
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,166
Nobody leaves until tomorrow!

169
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,071
Wow! This one is real!
It's a Thompson, right?

170
00:23:20,437 --> 00:23:22,676
- May I hold it?
- Forget it!

171
00:23:22,796 --> 00:23:25,191
- I just wanna hold it!
- Idiot!

172
00:23:25,311 --> 00:23:27,873
There must be more, right?

173
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,236
I prefer other pistols!

174
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,821
Where are they?

175
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,804
Water pistols!

176
00:23:59,094 --> 00:24:03,273
- Did you come to unbind me?
- Thank you coming...

177
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,628
- Where will we ...?
- When?

178
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,557
- The attack?
- Our leaders are...

179
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,553
- Does the enemy know?
- How about the strategy?

180
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,319
Ils souhaiteraient
que vous restiez group s#

181
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,835
et attendiez dans cette pi ce.#

182
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,190
- Where are you from?
- Himeji.

183
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,516
And you?

184
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,644
- Matsuyama, in Shikoku.
- Hiroshima.

185
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,955
What?

186
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,032
For your drive!
Please accept it.

187
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,478
- Nothing for me?
- Here!

188
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,920
You calculate everything?
How stupid!

189
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,359
- Bullshit!
- Shut up!

190
00:25:29,479 --> 00:25:32,069
Just go on, you'll regret it!

191
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:36,478
Gentlemen! See you tomorrow!

192
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,155
Woooh!

193
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,104
We have to spend the night here?

194
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:47,632
One... Two... Three...

195
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:53,920
Four... Five... Six...

196
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,629
Seven.

197
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,678
Seven men and one woman.

198
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,755
Miss!

199
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,520
Here comes no.1!

200
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,339
Can you untie me?

201
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,904
What are you up to?

202
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,920
I've got some money!
You'll get half of it!

203
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,588
- I don't care about money...
- Stop it!

204
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,995
- Nice body! How old are you?
- Untie me!

205
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,480
Why are you tied up?

206
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,616
- He's killing without a reason!
- Without a ...?

207
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,880
- He just kills, no matter whom...
- Don't interefere!

208
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,071
- We are having a conversation!
- So will you untie me?

209
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,709
- Sure...
- Stop it! It tickles!

210
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,540
Will you spend the night with me,
if I untie you?

211
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:41,910
Yes!

212
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,672
You had a knife, right?
Give it to me!

213
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,316
Stop! You'll regret it!

214
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:30,237
Well? It's not dark yet but
you are in the mood already?

215
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,071
That was not what I thought about!

216
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,840
Shut up!
I'm not such kind of guy!

217
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,831
Just forget about that liar!

218
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,585
You are the best after all!

219
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,579
What are you doing?

220
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,953
You really kill everyone?
Without a special reason?

221
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,434
Bullshit!

222
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,597
Heart broken and
a headache on top of it...

223
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,414
Let's sleep until it becomes dark.

224
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,429
Good Night!

225
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,718
Tell me!
Are you a killer??

226
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:15,544
- Hey! I am first!
- There is a special order?

227
00:29:15,664 --> 00:29:17,632
Looking for trouble?!

228
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,353
- Piss off!
- You really feel like killing!

229
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,668
Piss off!

230
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,515
Piss off!

231
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,390
Me! Now you want to kill me!

232
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,117
OK! I'll cut you down!

233
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,229
Stop!

234
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,869
Put the knife down! At once!

235
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,385
So much about killing...

236
00:30:03,276 --> 00:30:05,456
- Just a toy.
- It must be real!

237
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,354
- A Mauser 712.
- A toy!

238
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:20,557
- Is it loaded?
- Yes. 6 bullets.

239
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,432
Wanna die?

240
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,036
Seem so.

241
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,039
Better die of sickness!

242
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,557
I don't want to.

243
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,305
You really want to be killed?

244
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,528
I think so.

245
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:47,183
- An accident would be better.
- Cars are no people.

246
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:48,992
- It's the same!
- No!

247
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,517
My murderer will look at me!

248
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,880
- I'll se myself in his eyes.
- "... in his eyes..."

249
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,798
- And?
- In this moment...

250
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,277
- ... I know who I am.
- "... who I am."

251
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:09,275
- But then you are dead!
- "... you are dead!"

252
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,313
No. In this moment...

253
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:18,194
- ... I know what I have to do.
- You know nothing! Shut up!

254
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,194
You mix something up!

255
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,394
Something is on your mind.

256
00:31:26,171 --> 00:31:29,135
That's why the enemy wants to
kill you when he shows up.

257
00:31:29,255 --> 00:31:30,314
Maybe.

258
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,193
- But I want to meet him.
- Just by hanging around...

259
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,101
- ... you won't.
- I will!

260
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,449
I think I'll meet him very soon.
That's why I started my journey.

261
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,256
I just took off, one morning.

262
00:31:46,813 --> 00:31:47,531
Yes!

263
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,389
You'll meet him!
I'll kill you tomorrow!

264
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:56,799
- Just now you didn't.
- I've always! Until now...

265
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:59,832
"Until now"?
You've killed before?

266
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:04,075
- Yes. Very often!
- Bullshit! I don't believe it!

267
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,606
I used my knife 15 or 16 times.
Half of the men have died.

268
00:32:07,726 --> 00:32:11,195
Liar! Someone like you
could never do that!

269
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,956
I've always carried a new
knife right here!

270
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:23,679
People understand the true
meaning of dead when having a weapon.

271
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,194
... when having a weapon.

272
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,955
Hold it!

273
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:52,103
The best is to put it in your
mouth, when shooting yourself!

274
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,749
Know how to shoot?

275
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,208
First you have to release it...

276
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:07,349
- You always have it with you?
- Yes.

277
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,549
- Why?
- Since I have it, ...

278
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,192
... I know what kind of
person I really am.

279
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,321
- Not like you ...
- Exactly!

280
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,029
Since I carry a knife...

281
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,452
... I want to kill people!

282
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,695
- But 15 or 16 times? Bullshit!
- Trust me!

283
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,680
After leaving the Marines...

284
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,173
... I became crazy for card games.

285
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:41,195
I came to Kamagasaki in 1960.
I had heard about a great casino.

286
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,149
But I found nothing.

287
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,879
I was so angry I bought a knife.

288
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,710
I stabbed a guy with it.

289
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:54,713
I interfered in
other peoples' fights ...

290
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,047
... just to cut down both men.

291
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,091
And you think you know me?

292
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,909
Bullshit!
You're crazy!

293
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,255
Once I start ...

294
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,800
... I kill 100s of people with
my rifle! That's it!

295
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,644
Just shoot at birds with
your air-gun, boy!

296
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:23,839
You'll never know how good it
feels stabbing someone.

297
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,795
Stop it!

298
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,623
I don't shoot people!

299
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,876
Who was that?

300
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,357
- I don't like him!
- Tie him up again!

301
00:35:10,909 --> 00:35:13,274
All Japanese men should
be tied up!

302
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:11,287
- I went to a funeral.
- There was a funeral.

303
00:36:11,542 --> 00:36:14,023
Boss told me to attend the funeral.

304
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,796
Sorry,
what's this?

305
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,000
- A TV.
- Show me!

306
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,126
Sure.

307
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,630
- Where are you going?
- Pee!

308
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,427
The enemy is ready.

309
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,592
Did the HQ send a message?

310
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,054
Yes, someone's at the air field.

311
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,916
The enemy is ready.

312
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:01,669
- Should we hand out the guns?
- Let's wait for the leaders.

313
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,111
They aren't coming!

314
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,998
Are the weapons ready?

315
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,797
You spied on us?!

316
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:14,510
Pig! Pervert! Bastard!

317
00:37:15,932 --> 00:37:16,616
Hey!

318
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,115
I am going back! Don't worry!

319
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,098
Which gang are you?

320
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,195
Should I write "TV"?

321
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,552
- And the other one?
- "Companion".

322
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,432
Where am I?

323
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,615
- What does it mean?
- "Female".

324
00:38:28,172 --> 00:38:29,841
This must be "male" then?

325
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:33,671
You are the "male".
So come on! Be a man!

326
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,152
It's going to start soon.

327
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,840
It's going to start!
It's going to start!

328
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,590
- There are 30 rifles!
- Where?!

329
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,676
101 samurai swords!

330
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,308
And on top of it 60 pistols!

331
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,790
The enemy is ready!

332
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,475
Police is getting ready too.

333
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:00,310
- The killing will start soon!
- Do you know at which time?

334
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,109
Bang! Bang! Everybody's shooting!

335
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,882
Friend and foe,
you're going to die!

336
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,390
Flowers will bloom after your dead.

337
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,230
Your graves will be ...

338
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,398
... full of flowers!

339
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,153
Stupid cow! Stop it!

340
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,315
I am 18, but I am in full bloom!

341
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,074
I want to fight with a man!

342
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,195
It's going to start!
It's going to start!

343
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,194
- And now ...
- Stop it!

344
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,790
Swords are not good...

345
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,953
- We must ask for rifles.
- I'm coming too!

346
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,568
Go!

347
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,919
That's the third victim.

348
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:02,560
The third victim of the
mysterious sniper!

349
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,240
Miss Sano was on her way
home from tailor class.

350
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,200
The bullets hit her without warning.

351
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,993
Just like the incident that
had happened 40 minutes before.

352
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,320
Nobody has seen the sniper.

353
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,228
Nobody knows, where he was hiding.

354
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:22,520
Meanwhile, office worker
T. Watanabe has told police ...

355
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:28,058
... that a foreigner with a
rifle took away his car.

356
00:40:28,324 --> 00:40:33,113
Police assumes that his foreigner
must be the mysterious sniper.

357
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:37,272
His nationality is unknown.

358
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:42,145
The position of the car is unkown.

359
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,976
Should the foreigner be the sniper...

360
00:40:47,096 --> 00:40:51,954
... he is able to move around
with the car and act everywhere.

361
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:57,800
The police is telling the public
not to leave the house.

362
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:01,356
Turn on TVs or radios for
further information!

363
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:06,388
Like a miracle the friend of
the first victims survived...

364
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,434
Is it far away to go to this guy?

365
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:18,806
When he comes with a car...

366
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:24,309
- ... one hour!
- Why is he doing that?

367
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,349
- No idea!
- A foreigner ...

368
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,918
No foreigner! A white man!

369
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,189
Three people in one hour!

370
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,349
He has a rifle with a
sighting telescope!

371
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,278
Lucky guy! Why don't you
let me have a rifle too?

372
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,980
There won't be any in
a room like this!

373
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:55,114
Please! A rifle! I'll join you!

374
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,682
I am very sorry about this.

375
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,513
Are you feeling alright?

376
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,149
Work will start very soon.

377
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,680
- Will we get our weapons?
- Yes.

378
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,394
- Rifles and pistols of course!
- Yes.

379
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,659
We are just calculating
how to distribute them.

380
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,688
Excuse me!

381
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:49,477
Not such a mood-killer-song!

382
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:57,537
Good Afternoon! Dear world!

383
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,075
That kills me!

384
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,238
Good afternoon!

385
00:44:01,867 --> 00:44:03,699
Murder and suicide for love!

386
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:06,869
Good afternoon, dear Japan!

387
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:14,874
Good afternoon, in 1970!

388
00:44:14,994 --> 00:44:18,480
Good afternoon! Good afternoon!

389
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,716
Idiot! Stupid!

390
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,077
Did it come from over there?

391
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:36,511
Sounded like an accident.

392
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,551
So they've got weapons already!

393
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:45,272
I want a rifle too! Please!

394
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,846
Have a look and get some!

395
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,478
But ... only me ...

396
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:01,719
Take him with you. That'll do.

397
00:45:04,109 --> 00:45:05,280
Are you coming?

398
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:13,194
What do you need rifles for?

399
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,115
You are no true men after all!

400
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,836
Why do you need rifles?
You can't kill anyone!

401
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,355
- I can!
- Liar!

402
00:45:22,475 --> 00:45:25,764
You did not even touch me!
You want to be a killer?

403
00:45:25,884 --> 00:45:27,635
Very funny indeed?

404
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,711
You want me to show you? Where?

405
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,030
Here, in front of everyone!

406
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,395
Fine ...

407
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:39,280
Well? How about the rifles?

408
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,277
Later! I am first!

409
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,235
Shall I?

410
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:08,038
- You wanna die, right?
- Stop it!

411
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:12,158
He does not really
want to be killed!

412
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:13,995
I want to!

413
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:20,916
Try it! With your pistol!

414
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:37,810
Aren't you scared?

415
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:44,346
You really wanna die?

416
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,812
Better say it,
if you have any doubts!

417
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:50,031
I have nothing to say.

418
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,780
Fine ... can you see your face?

419
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:59,034
Not sure. It's not very clear.

420
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:01,280
You wanna fight?

421
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,291
Hey! What are you doing?!

422
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:04,555
Shut up!

423
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:14,193
Die!

424
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:29,712
Stoppage of gun!

425
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,583
It happens.

426
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,142
- What ...
- I can repair it.

427
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,593
Will you give it back?

428
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:39,039
- Yes.
- Really?

429
00:47:46,929 --> 00:47:49,723
- It will take 30 minutes.
- I will wait.

430
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:06,879
There was this guy,
who decieved his friends.

431
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:12,517
He always played the honest one.

432
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:16,472
But then it was decided,
that he must die.

433
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:21,587
He stood up bravely
in front of the pistol.

434
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:26,072
Nothing he could do about it.
It was decided.

435
00:48:26,973 --> 00:48:27,785
But ...

436
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,712
... he insisted on
not having decieved anybody.

437
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:37,869
I pulled the trigger,
but stoppage of gun!

438
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:44,032
I hoped he would run away
while I was reparing the gun.

439
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:48,352
We had been friends after all.

440
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:53,200
But he did not run away.

441
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:58,395
He waited two long hours,
until the gun was repaired.

442
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:02,712
And then - Bang! - he was dead.

443
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:08,674
That's a long time ago. There
were not so many guns then.

444
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:12,178
What do you say?

445
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:16,829
You!

446
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:19,235
You!

447
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:23,073
30 minutes, right?

448
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,994
Will you give me your 30 minutes?

449
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:48,117
- That's okay, right?
- Yes, now I can.

450
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,908
I have not been wearing
underwear the whole time.

451
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:20,280
The police assumptions were right.

452
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:23,800
The foreigner is the
mysterious sniper.

453
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:27,775
Officer Hideo Jun was attacked
from a passing car... 

454
00:50:27,895 --> 00:50:30,675
... while being on patrol
on highway no.1. 

455
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,833
It was the car which had
been stolen a short time before.

456
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:38,782
The sniper is fleeing towards
the east.

457
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:45,767
His looks and motives stay unclear.

458
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:53,179
He is shooting while driving which
complicates the whole situation.

459
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:59,515
The Police is trying to block ...

460
00:50:59,988 --> 00:51:02,320
- What are you doing?!
- Repair it! Quick!

461
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:05,200
Let's go over there!
Just 20 minutes left!

462
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:08,360
- The foreigner is coming?
- He'll pass by.

463
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:13,076
I'll wait then.
I want to see him.

464
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:16,682
- I'll do it once the gun is ready.
- The foreigner will kill me!

465
00:51:16,802 --> 00:51:19,866
- I can do it!
- Shut up! It's my job!

466
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:24,820
I'll have my knife soon,
just wait and see ...

467
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:29,113
Bullshite! Awww, my body hurts.
Bye bye!

468
00:51:37,534 --> 00:51:38,809
Nobody's here!

469
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,090
What's wrong?

470
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:37,396
They are gone! Without you!

471
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:41,958
Serves you right!
That's the end, I guess.

472
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,391
- Nobody's there?
- No.

473
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:10,188
Poverty and hunger ...

474
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,518
... are the reason for everything.

475
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,860
Come! Let's go!

476
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:19,790
- I should kill him!
- But it's all over!

477
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:23,430
- The pistol will be fine soon.
- Who cares? He's my man!

478
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:30,053
Please don't go!

479
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:49,516
There's enough time left.

480
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:54,271
What's going on?
Nobody is here!

481
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,594
- The fight is cancelled.
- But why?

482
00:53:58,437 --> 00:54:01,720
One of our leaders was
caught on the airfield.

483
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:05,497
- The cops?
- Yes. A crackdown!

484
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,697
They'll be here soon.

485
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,792
So I want to ask you ...

486
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,231
Out of my way!

487
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:20,272
- Shall we fight he police?
- No! Calm down!

488
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:24,115
- With the rifles? "Call down"?
- You want us to be arrested?

489
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:29,030
Out of my way!

490
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:33,392
I would take responsibility.

491
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,085
But only me? That would stink.

492
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:39,319
So I ask for your cooperation.

493
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:43,310
When the verdict was spoken...

494
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:46,073
What about the others?

495
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:49,041
They just ran away.

496
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:58,029
- And now we are the substitutes?
- Exactly.

497
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:03,391
When you are arrested, the
others will earn some time.

498
00:55:03,511 --> 00:55:05,200
Is that a joke?!

499
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:08,067
We came to fight!
Not for going to jail!

500
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:11,719
Relax!

501
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:14,719
There's lots of time!

502
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,277
But let me tell you:

503
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:21,748
Not a word to the police!

504
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:25,353
You don't know anything anyway...

505
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:27,915
- How dare you?!
- Shut up!

506
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:31,501
Wanna die?

507
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:36,520
Or stand the bad food for
some days and go home?

508
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:37,629
Well?

509
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:47,400
Out of my way!
The big rock will break!

510
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,954
- I'll go for the bad food.
- Miss!

511
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,958
You should go home!

512
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,399
Will you join me?

513
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:59,679
Me as a young man ...

514
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:03,317
... committed many crimes.

515
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,315
Oh ...

516
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:09,109
Povert and hunger ...

517
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:12,956
... are the reasons for everything.

518
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:16,516
Poverty and hunger ...

519
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:20,117
... are the reason for everything.

520
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:24,359
Out of my way!
I hit you in pieces!

521
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:27,358
Big rock.

522
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,990
Out of my way!

523
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:34,870
I can't return to freedom yet.

524
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:38,157
Stop singing!

525
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:43,429
When the verdict was spoken ...

526
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:47,031
... the girl cried out loud.

527
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:51,269
Five years of penitientiary.

528
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:55,071
That was too much!

529
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:59,430
Out of my way! I hit you in pieces!

530
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:02,439
Big rock!

531
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:06,109
Out of my way! Out of my way!

532
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:10,193
I can't return to freedom yet.

533
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:15,635
I can't return to freedom yet.

534
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:23,115
Can't find a man
in this darkness.

535
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:26,038
What can I do but sleep?

536
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:40,878
Oh, I did not go peeing
since last evening.

537
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:24,148
It's me!
It's morning already!

538
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:27,400
- What's going on?
- Are the cops coming?

539
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:29,351
Nobody. Everything's quiet.

540
00:58:30,731 --> 00:58:32,760
You know why I came back?

541
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:46,396
The TV's sound is working again.

542
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:53,956
The foreigenr is probably
hiding inside of the city.

543
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:56,999
Somewhere here in the city.

544
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:59,880
9 1/2 hours after
the first incident ...

545
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:05,014
... and 5 hours after the attack
on a police officer on the high way:

546
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:08,733
He did not show up at the
road barriers, ...

547
00:59:08,853 --> 00:59:11,629
... so he must be in the city.

548
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:15,464
Damned! He's in the city?

549
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:17,315
Probably.

550
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:22,599
Just forget it!

551
01:00:37,778 --> 01:00:39,250
It's working?

552
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:46,159
There are lots of toys in the box!

553
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:54,955
A rifle!

554
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:58,464
- For me too.
- I'll have two swords.

555
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:17,990
Two more rifles. Who takes them?

556
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:20,835
- What for?
- For killing of course.

557
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:22,235
Killing whom?

558
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:30,992
Now we have weapons.
But at whom shall we aim?

559
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:33,516
Nobody here to give orders.

560
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,798
So the fight is over?

561
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:41,920
- You won't do anything?
- Nothing we can do.

562
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:45,430
- No enemy!
- So we'll just go home?

563
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:48,400
That's why I am asking!
What shall we do?

564
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:51,353
Use your heads!
Don't you have any enemies?

565
01:01:51,948 --> 01:01:54,174
Someone you really want to kill?

566
01:02:43,681 --> 01:02:47,070
I'll go! Who cares whom I kill?

567
01:02:53,404 --> 01:02:55,096
You don't think I can do it?

568
01:02:57,880 --> 01:03:00,189
What a fine gang we are!

569
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:03,354
A white sniper and gang wars.

570
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:06,119
- Life is hard for the cops.
- Is nobody coming with me?

571
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,299
- Me!
- Where to?

572
01:03:07,419 --> 01:03:08,543
- Doesn't matter!
- Me too.

573
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:13,000
87 persons were arrested
and 23 pistols were found, ...

574
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:15,553
... also 20 sowrds and 3 carabiners.

575
01:03:15,673 --> 01:03:17,818
The investigations will be continued.

576
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:20,800
It's like Dallas!
We are like a Japanese Dallas!

577
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:24,240
The white sniper still hides
within the city.

578
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:28,194
At the same time armed gangs
are roaming through the streets.

579
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:31,553
About 200 gangsters!

580
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:36,380
All dangeous elements!
It's just like Dallas!

581
01:03:37,328 --> 01:03:39,635
Repair the picture
until sunrise!

582
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:56,318
Hey ... Dallas?

583
01:03:56,438 --> 01:03:58,351
Kennedy was killed there, right?

584
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:04,155
Sleep with me!
The night will be over soon ...

585
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:05,995
Dallas ...

586
01:04:07,698 --> 01:04:09,681
In Dallas and still alive.

587
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:17,131
What about you, toy-man?

588
01:04:19,426 --> 01:04:21,165
TV-Mann? How about it?

589
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:27,269
- I'll go!
- Me too. Everyone is okay for me!

590
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:30,402
Stop! Where are you going?

591
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,964
Go home!
It's dangerous!

592
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:32,432
What? Back already?

593
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:39,719
I got two.
It was boring!

594
01:07:39,839 --> 01:07:40,624
Really?

595
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:44,749
I got three. But nothing
to be happy about.

596
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:46,875
Repaired!

597
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:57,595
Look who's there!

598
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:02,397
Arrested! Serves him right!

599
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:04,192
Leave us here to the police!

600
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:10,621
- Let's go!
- The news!

601
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:16,687
The American summer with
the race riots ...

602
01:08:16,807 --> 01:08:20,760
"Long and hot American Summer".

603
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:24,395
How can we call this
Japanese summer?

604
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:28,794
No blackmen riots but a
white man is the cause of trouble.

605
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:31,670
Just look at the many victims!

606
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:37,905
Despite of the police order to
stay at home ...

607
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:41,638
... the area was full of people
heading for the factory.

608
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:47,575
After ten hours of silence the
sniper shoot many bullets again.

609
01:08:48,850 --> 01:08:52,235
Nobody knows about his motives.

610
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:58,760
Our team is tryint to catch
a glance of him and report.

611
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:03,235
We don't know when we
will be shot at.

612
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:07,946
But it's our duty as journalists.

613
01:09:08,421 --> 01:09:10,119
That's him! We found him!

614
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:15,554
That's him?

615
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:28,270
I'll go and face his rifle-

616
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:36,510
I'll fight with him!

617
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:39,686
- He just shot!
- How many will I get?

618
01:09:39,806 --> 01:09:42,916
Arm yourself! Rifles or
sowrds! What ever!

619
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:51,792
- What are you doing!
- I'm leaving! It's over!

620
01:09:57,920 --> 01:09:59,592
The other one too!

621
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:26,917
And you? Will you come?

622
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:57,715
How?

623
01:10:58,439 --> 01:10:59,700
We have a car!

624
01:10:59,820 --> 01:11:01,440
- What kind of?
- A small one.

625
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:03,790
For 5 person.
2 people too mich.

626
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:07,996
We are not going. Right?

627
01:11:08,375 --> 01:11:09,669
You won't get it.

628
01:11:09,789 --> 01:11:11,239
- But ...
- Shut up!

629
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:36,797
Leave me alone!

630
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:40,629
I had enough!

631
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:44,872
Then go!
Just five people!

632
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:48,568
The foreigner or the police?
Who's our enemy?

633
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:54,661
- Good bye!
- Bye bye, idiot!

634
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:56,518
Just die!

635
01:12:05,072 --> 01:12:06,290
What was that about?

636
01:12:10,316 --> 01:12:11,394
TV-man?

637
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:32,399
What was that?
Who fired?

638
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:36,645
He would have attacked
the foreigner!!

639
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:40,919
So there is one man less.

640
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:45,277
- Can I come too?
- No women!

641
01:12:45,397 --> 01:12:47,848
Why?
I wanna sleep with the foreigner.

642
01:12:57,200 --> 01:13:01,079
Poverty and hunger ...

643
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:05,110
... are the reason for everything.

644
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:11,593
The situation remains complicated.

645
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,991
A car is approaching!

646
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:16,754
The car has passed by the
barriers build by the police!

647
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:20,229
The car is approaching the sniper!
What's going on here?

648
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:22,751
You can see the car now.

649
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:25,718
There are 5 persons in the car!
They are Japanese!

650
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:28,362
They have rifles!

651
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:32,355
We cannot say what these
people are up to!

652
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:55,520
Will he shoot?

653
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:59,877
No idea.
I'm sure he'll be alarmed though.

654
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:03,164
I'll shoot at the police then!

655
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,437
Then he knows we are his friends.

656
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:09,318
- Why not?
- It's too early!

657
01:15:37,240 --> 01:15:38,514
Mr foreigner!

658
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:41,714
We want to join you!

659
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:44,093
He won't understand that!

660
01:15:59,972 --> 01:16:01,781
What? That's dangerous!

661
01:16:04,040 --> 01:16:05,155
Such an idiot!

662
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:07,763
I'll shoot!

663
01:16:10,378 --> 01:16:11,503
Don't!

664
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:15,364
What is he up to?

665
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:31,997
No police! No police!
Friend! Friend!

666
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:48,906
Did he understand?
He did not shoot.

667
01:16:55,420 --> 01:16:57,317
Fine! I'll go too!

668
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,195
No police! Friend!

669
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:04,430
Friend! Darling!

670
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:10,197
Leave! It's dangerous!

671
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:14,198
Leave! Leave at once!

672
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:23,977
Leave!

673
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:28,358
It's dangerous! Leave!

674
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:30,719
Leave at once!

675
01:17:56,120 --> 01:17:57,519
Friend! Friend!

676
01:17:58,280 --> 01:17:59,998
Darling! Friend!

677
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:01,795
My friend?

678
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:07,352
Exactly! Friend!

679
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:15,517
Friend!
Let's shake hands!

680
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:49,105
- Alrigh! He's understood us
- Understood what?

681
01:18:49,708 --> 01:18:51,644
That we are on his side!

682
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:17,556
- What are you doing?
- You!

683
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:20,375
- What are you doing?
- They are getting on my nerves.

684
01:19:20,495 --> 01:19:22,068
- Leave!
- Shut up!

685
01:19:23,818 --> 01:19:25,796
What is your plan?!

686
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:28,113
Who are you?!

687
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:45,430
Idiot!

688
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:48,357
Darling! Let's be friends!

689
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:52,028
You must be hungry! Here!

690
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:14,630
Don't worry! It's not poisened.

691
01:21:06,338 --> 01:21:07,521
Who is that?!

692
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:09,683
Can't you seee it?

693
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:12,628
- A foreigner.
- But what kind of?

694
01:21:13,237 --> 01:21:14,697
And why is he doing this?

695
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:18,713
Why? Why?

696
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:27,949
Why? Why?

697
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:30,154
I'm twenty years old.

698
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:35,390
Oh, 20? I am 18.

699
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:40,798
20? I know how you feel.

700
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:52,912
- You understand him? Why?
- I just do.

701
01:21:54,640 --> 01:21:56,710
What do you want?

702
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:01,230
I'll fight with him.

703
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:05,531
Me too!

704
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:11,149
Yes? Me: Eighteen!

705
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:15,550
- Me, eighteen.
- Eighteen?

706
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:18,710
You, twenty.

707
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:21,875
Me, eighteen.

708
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:23,955
Yes.

709
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:34,952
Me, seventeen.

710
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:37,836
Me, fifty-one!

711
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:01,430
Why did you come with us?

712
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:07,635
I know.

713
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:11,471
Huh? You know?

714
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:30,917
You want to kill the foreigner.

715
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:35,389
Right!

716
01:23:36,859 --> 01:23:37,636
No!

717
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:44,676
- Let's get out of here!
- Tear gas!

718
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,275
Weapons down! Come out!

719
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:50,634
If you shoot again, ...

720
01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:53,117
... we'll shoot back!

721
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:55,877
Weapons down and come out!

722
01:23:58,160 --> 01:24:00,879
Drop the gun! And come out!

723
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:05,190
If you shoot again, we'll use our guns!

724
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:08,912
Drop the gun and surrender!

725
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:23,512
Just leave him!

726
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:27,709
Leave him! He's dead!

727
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:33,749
Hey, hurry up!

728
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:37,870
Come on! Come on, let's go!
Hurry up! Hurry up!

729
01:24:42,403 --> 01:24:43,633
What are you doing?

730
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:52,386
C'mon! Let's go!

731
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:07,794
Drop your guns! Come out!

732
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:10,033
You are surrounded!

733
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:13,035
Drop your guns and surrender!

734
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:16,070
If you don't obey, ...

735
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:18,318
... we'll use our guns!

736
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:22,954
Drop the gun and come out!

737
01:25:23,640 --> 01:25:26,108
We have you surrounded!
Come out!

738
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:29,960
With your hands up! If you don't ...

739
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:32,420
- Shit! Arrogant asshole!
- That's dangerous!

740
01:25:32,540 --> 01:25:34,152
That's why I am shooting!

741
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:02,390
Drop your guns and come out!

742
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:05,350
You can't resist!

743
01:26:06,240 --> 01:26:08,549
Drop your guns and surrender!

744
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,036
Drop the gun and come out!

745
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:17,196
It's useless to resist!
You don't have a chance!

746
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:20,554
Drop the gun! And surrender!

747
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:26,958
Will we do it? Bang! Bang!

748
01:27:29,480 --> 01:27:31,596
What? You don't want to?

749
01:27:33,554 --> 01:27:34,899
Then piss off!

750
01:27:38,644 --> 01:27:39,838
I'll do it myself.

751
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:46,478
Hey, TV-man! How about you?

752
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:52,523
He said: People only understand
death when they have a weapon.

753
01:28:55,880 --> 01:28:58,838
- Shoot me.
- Why me?

754
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:02,959
I'm nt sure ...
But I want you to.

755
01:29:35,935 --> 01:29:36,724
Uff!

756
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:53,997
Time for decision!
I've been waiting for this!

757
01:30:23,822 --> 01:30:24,506
Hey!

758
01:30:25,549 --> 01:30:26,651
What's going on?

759
01:30:29,897 --> 01:30:31,682
I shot the white guy!

760
01:30:56,600 --> 01:30:58,160
I killed him!

761
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:00,351
What was that?!

762
01:31:46,720 --> 01:31:47,675
You ...?

763
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:04,277
You!

764
01:32:12,680 --> 01:32:14,671
"My murderer will look at me."

765
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:17,762
"I will se myself in his eyes."

766
01:32:18,040 --> 01:32:19,884
"Then I will know who I am."

767
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:22,560
"I will know what I have to do."

768
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:26,228
"My murderer ..."

769
01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:29,674
- What's your name?
- Nejiko.

770
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:33,597
"A woman with a loose screw (Neji)."
And you?

771
01:32:34,680 --> 01:32:37,801
I don't have a name.
The man who will vaporize.

772
01:32:38,646 --> 01:32:39,721
And now?

773
01:32:50,360 --> 01:32:51,315
Nejiko!

774
01:34:02,360 --> 01:34:03,679
Wonderful!

775
01:34:05,355 --> 01:34:06,904
A love-double-suicide.

776
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:12,070
Not a voluntary one!
