1
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,002
Put everything in the bags.
Oh, the coffin's here.

2
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,123
Put it here, on the small table.

3
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,720
There you are. Come on. That's it.

4
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,484
Now put him in here.

5
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,890
Carefully, eh?

6
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,087
That's another one
who can be buried properly, eh?

7
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:04,970
Only another... 98,137 to go.

8
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,601
Oh dear, is that the time already?
Time flies, doesn't it?

9
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,963
Don't forget
there's no school tomorrow, kids.

10
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,285
See you Monday, Miss.

11
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,246
And tell your mom and dad to make sure
they make the right choice on Sunday.

12
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:51,167
Hello. Allow me to introduce
our newest friend, Porki.

13
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,251
This pig robot
was specially designed

14
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,171
for you, modern pig breeders.

15
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,169
Hello, Porki.

16
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,082
This machine makes your work easier.

17
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,363
From now on, no more
messing around in your pigsty,

18
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,087
no more crazy antics
to get your sows pregnant.

19
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,249
Yes, Porki, yes.

20
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,611
Look at that, isn't it wonderful?

21
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,366
We're putting progress into operation.

22
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,804
One press of this button
and Porki does his job.

23
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,088
This robotic computer works using
smell and sound recognition.

24
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,246
The smell the robot gives off
stimulates your pigs' pheromones,

25
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,649
so that a spontaneous desire
to reproduce is awakened.

26
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:45,011
Your sow will interpret the computer's
grunting as a mating grunt,

27
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,329
as a result of which
she will be sexually receptive.

28
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:57,606
SCIENTIFIC CAMERA

29
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,730
Thanks to Porki your fertility problems
are a thing of the past.

30
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,087
Thank you, who? Thank you, Porki.

31
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:22,050
Hey, Porki,
don't you listen to me any more?

32
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,449
Com.Sales is doing extremely well.

33
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:35,771
Because, for Com.Sales there is
no substitute for...

34
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,203
Victory!
- No substitute for... victory!

35
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,960
One, two, three, four, five.

36
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,606
One, two, three, four, five.

37
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,771
One, two, three, four, five.
Victory!

38
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,925
My friends,
you are going to sell your friend Porki

39
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,011
to the biggest pig breeders in the Benelux.
How are we going to do that?

40
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,085
Via an incredible competition
with very simple rules.

41
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:10,083
Whoever sells the most Porkies... wins.

42
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,567
Whoever sells the fewest, loses.

43
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:18,324
The winner will receive
an extra year's pay, this amazing wheel

44
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:24,044
with the accompanying
All-Wheel Drive Crossover Convertible...

45
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,930
And, hold on, possibly
the most important thing of all...

46
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,088
a kiss from Katja.

47
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,606
Whoever loses,
will be sacked immediately

48
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,246
and his salary paid to the winner.

49
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,886
The competition will run for
3 nights and 3 days

50
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,562
and end Sunday evening, precisely.

51
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,765
And, my dear friends, it will start...

52
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,450
now!

53
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,727
Go! And Friesland, go.
And Limburg, go.

54
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:03,482
The Kempen, go. And go, go, go!

55
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,327
Mr Fierens,
does it really have to be this weekend?

56
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,446
Yeah, well, it's your choice, Tony.

57
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,246
Do you want to be a winner or a loser?

58
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,768
Let me see. Westhoek?

59
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,203
Tony Roozen, lucky you,
that's a pig paradise.

60
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,721
Come on, go, go, go.
That's the spirit, Tony.

61
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,727
And remember, the jungle is dark
but it's full of diamonds.

62
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,008
Fuck, Andy!
- What's the matter?

63
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,124
I'm supposed to go to the Ardennes
with Bea and her parents.

64
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,289
What's the problem?

65
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,166
I was going to
officially ask her to marry me.

66
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:45,241
Yabba-Dabba, motherfucker!
Congratulations.

67
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,130
Now Fierens has come up with
the competition. What do I do?

68
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,881
Ask her a week later.
She's not going anywhere.

69
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,210
Nor are the Ardennes.
A car and a year's pay are at stake.

70
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,609
If you've got to choose between
the jackpot or the Ardennes,

71
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,406
I know what I'd choose.
- Fuck! You're right.

72
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,605
Of course I'm right, I'm a pig farmer.
And a pig farmer is always right.

73
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,442
Do something about that outfit, pal.

74
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,169
Hello, new best friend.

75
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,602
<i>Hi, it's Bea. Leave a message.
I'll definitely call you back Bye-bye.</i>

76
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,846
Bea, it's me. I'm coming to
the Ardennes but I'll be a bit late.

77
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,567
I have to take part in a competition
at work. Another of Fierens' ideas.

78
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,083
Maybe you can go to the Ardennes
with your parents in their car?

79
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:58,888
Can you call me? Bye... Oh yeah,
there are some great prizes to be won.

80
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,923
Triple kiss. Bye-bye.

81
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,642
Oh, Tony.
- Hi, baby.

82
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,889
Tony, please,
tell me I misunderstood you.

83
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,970
What's this about a competition?
- I don't have a choice.

84
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,889
Don't you have respect for anyone?

85
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:23,369
My parents are really looking forward
to it. Dad's even taking his banjo.

86
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,007
What have you got to say to that?
- Do you think I'm happy about it?

87
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,488
We have to sell pigs,
well, no, robots, actually...

88
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,923
and whoever sells the most pigs, wins.
- Wins what?

89
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,526
A luxury car... A convertible.

90
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,405
Really?
- Yes. And an extra year's pay.

91
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,082
So when are you coming to the Ardennes?
- Tomorrow evening. If all goes well.

92
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,324
Make sure that all goes well, eh?
You've got to win, Tony.

93
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,682
That's the idea, losing's not an option.

94
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,884
As long as you know.
If you lose, you can stay there.

95
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,082
I'm going to win, darling. For us.

96
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,406
So, is it OK?
- Yes.

97
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,206
Triple kiss?
- Triple kiss.

98
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,600
<i>Take the E40 highway.</i>

99
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,481
<i>Take the first exit
in the direction of Westhoek</i>

100
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,966
<i>Now turn right.</i>

101
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,689
<i>Follow this road for 300 meters.</i>

102
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,802
<i>Now turn left.</i>

103
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,086
<i>Now turn right.</i>

104
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,327
<i>You are on a non-digitized road.</i>

105
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,204
<i>Turn round.</i>

106
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:13,127
<i>You are on a non-digitized road.</i>
- Oh no! Come on!

107
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,851
<i>Turn round.</i>

108
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,888
Oh, fuck!

109
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,084
Oh, fuck.

110
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,125
Hello?

111
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,445
Hello?

112
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,326
Bloody hell!

113
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,283
Sir! Excuse me. Sir!

114
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,048
Excuse me, sir. Excuse me.

115
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,124
Could you tell me where I am, please?

116
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,766
In Madonna, as they call it.
- Where?

117
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,530
Madonna.

118
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,763
I... I'm looking for a hotel.

119
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,006
Are you a sales traveler?

120
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:32,210
Yes. Tony Roozen, Com.Sales.
"No substitute for victory."

121
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,442
I'm looking for a room for the night.

122
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,291
I've had an accident with my van.

123
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,646
You can stay at Gusta's,
Under the Lime Tree.

124
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,204
Oh, and where's that?

125
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:55,770
Well, next to the lime tree...
Where the lime tree used to be.

126
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,250
But it was hit by lightning in '03.

127
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,769
Three euros.

128
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,889
Sorry?
- Admission is three euros.

129
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,923
I haven't come to see the museum, sir.
I'm looking for someone to help me.

130
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:46,011
I've had an accident.
I drove my van into a ditch.

131
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:51,240
You looked in through the window.
So that's three euros.

132
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:13,090
Now I'd like to ask you to get off my
property. The museum is about to close.

133
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,081
Hello, madam. I need to make
an urgent phone call.

134
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,049
Madam?

135
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,683
I've had enough.
It's too ridiculous for words.

136
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,565
Come back, Maria.
It's an open debate.

137
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:32,970
Everyone is entitled to their opinion.
- You listen to one another in a debate.

138
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,164
What do they take me for?
- You're being unreasonable.

139
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,601
Unreasonable?
- Unreasonable. Now you know.

140
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,566
My school has ten pupils left.
If one more leaves, it'll have to close.

141
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:47,448
That's the end of your village,
Mr Mayor. Worry about that instead.

142
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,449
And come out from behind my bar.

143
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,849
I'm not having
a private discussion with you.

144
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:56,010
So may I ask you politely
to come back to the meeting?

145
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:00,205
You're a member of our panel, some
degree of responsibility is required.

146
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,849
Hello... Could you help me? I...
- Just a moment.

147
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:10,846
Gusta, I'm going to have a beer.
I'll write it down.

148
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,811
A moment, yeah...

149
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:41,162
Right, to get back to the agenda.

150
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:45,890
Just before our charming village
school teacher's emotional outburst

151
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,562
we had reached the final item,
Other Business.

152
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,683
We haven't actually achieved a thing.

153
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:56,524
There's a request from Brussels and
Europe to widen the old road to Madonna

154
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,961
and turn the crossroads
into a roundabout.

155
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,731
That request is being ignored
by the local council

156
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,242
because the mayor and his pals
would rather have a new main road,

157
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,126
from the coast to Madonna, through
the battlefields. Do you know why?

158
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:13,291
So their fields will be compulsorily
purchased in order to make them more money.

159
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,289
That's a load of rubbish.
- It isn't.

160
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,289
That's a load of rubbish
and you know it.

161
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:21,849
We're not ignoring anything. The request
from Brussels isn't unreasonable

162
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,486
but maybe there are other alternatives

163
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:28,526
that they wouldn't think of in Brussels
but that we, the local authority, would

164
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,246
because of our experience in the field.

165
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,809
But this is a real democracy here.
So we're going to vote on it on Sunday.

166
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,402
Anyway, Miss, seeing as you are
so concerned about your school

167
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,604
and our village emptying,
you should vote for the new road.

168
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,810
Because that new road will improve
access to our village

169
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,562
and attract new families
and, listen, new pupils.

170
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:53,441
That will take at least
ten years, Your Worship.

171
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,247
We don't have that. And battlefields
mustn't be sacrificed for a new road.

172
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,922
The battlefields. There she goes again.
- I agree, I agree.

173
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,600
If we have to wait till
the plans for a new main road

174
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,849
have been approved by
Europe's officials, it'll be too late.

175
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:11,887
The English will never agree to us laying
a new road through their battlefields.

176
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,844
Their fallen soldiers are there.

177
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:18,011
No, we should opt to widen the old road.

178
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,120
Persyn, you're only against our proposal

179
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,971
because your petrol station
is on the old road

180
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:27,881
and you won't benefit
from a new main road.

181
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,971
I have to think of my business.
You don't get something for nothing.

182
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,403
I can understand that,
seeing as you are a businessman,

183
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:39,042
but the fact that you, as a businessman,
refuse to do your job

184
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:44,326
by not supplying your fellow villagers
with petrol or other lubricants

185
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,967
and make everyone's life here
unnecessarily complicated,

186
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,924
making it difficult for us...

187
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:54,569
refusing to do that
is what I call blackmail.

188
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,125
He's right, you know.

189
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,325
I'm not refusing. I'm on strike.
It's a one-man campaign.

190
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,091
It's nothing but blackmail.
- Calm down, Roger.

191
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:08,367
That junction, where that statue is,
is a triangle.

192
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,767
And the only thing
Europe is asking us to do

193
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,760
is to turn that junction into
a roundabout and widen the old road.

194
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,010
It isn't a triangle.
The Madonna junction isn't a triangle.

195
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:24,043
Those corners aren't points.
A triangle without points...

196
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,483
Miss, as a school teacher
you should know

197
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,843
what a triangle without points is.
It's a circle!

198
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,407
That Madonna is going to stay there.

199
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,888
She's stood there all her life
and she's going to stay there.

200
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,766
Roger, that roundabout is triangular.
It's a triangle.

201
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,930
We can't deny it.
It is, in fact, a hexagon.

202
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,124
If I could,
I'd go on strike with Persyn,

203
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,723
but I don't want to let your children
down. This debate is a waste of time.

204
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,287
I have work to do.
- What did she say?

205
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,051
She's off. She's off again.

206
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,769
That's easy.
- In her case that's insubordination.

207
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,122
Calm down, Roger.
- Right.

208
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,684
I'm going to try to explain it
one more time.

209
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,168
The widening of the old road
is the least painful solution.

210
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:16,809
And if that statue has to stand on
a roundabout instead of at a crossroads,

211
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,401
so be it.
So I'm sticking to my guns.

212
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:25,209
As long as there is opposition, I'm not
supplying anyone with petrol. No one.

213
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,767
Who doesn't agree can
go to Ypres, 30 km away.

214
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,810
And another thing,
if the vote goes against it Sunday,

215
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,924
I'm setting fire to my pumps
and I'm out of here.

216
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,649
If threats are going to be made,
we'd better stop.

217
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,640
We're going to stop.
Sunday's referendum will decide.

218
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,611
There you go, Gusta.

219
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,083
Are you the garage owner?

220
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:25,050
Yes. Passed down from father to son,
for more than fifty years.

221
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,923
What are you doing here?

222
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:33,331
My work, I'm a sales rep.
Com.Sales...

223
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,483
"No substitute for victory."

224
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:44,650
I didn't go to school for that long.
- A sales traveler.

225
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,648
A sales traveler?
Do you want to sell me something?

226
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:52,640
No, no, no,
I've driven my van into a ditch.

227
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,650
I thought maybe you could help me
and pull me out.

228
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,046
Where did it happen?

229
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,961
On the road near that statue of Madonna,
by that... triangular roundabout.

230
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:05,449
Now he's going on about a triangle too.
It hasn't got any corners, has it?

231
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,325
That's a roundabout, eh?
- That'll do.

232
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:11,649
You must be a real idiot
if you drove into that ditch.

233
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,443
I was a bit disoriented.

234
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,086
I thought I saw a soldier
jump in front of my van,

235
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,408
turned my wheel
and ended up in the ditch.

236
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,444
A soldier? The last one to see
soldiers here was Gusta.

237
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,770
Eh, Gusta? How long ago was it
that you saw soldiers? In 1917?

238
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,440
Eh? When your Prosper went to the front?

239
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,366
That's a long time ago,
so if you saw a soldier,

240
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,040
you don't need a mechanic,
you need a doctor.

241
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,366
Here, Your Worship,
I've got a customer for you.

242
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:43,928
No one here is laughing
at your jokes, Persyn.

243
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,721
Maybe that's because you're not joking.

244
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,964
I don't need your help, doctor.
- The mayor is a vet.

245
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:56,130
He pretends he's a doctor after work.
An amateur gynecologist.

246
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,442
Hey, Persyn, you've been warned.

247
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,847
I'll tell you what...

248
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:05,602
Buy me a snifter and
I'll pull you out tomorrow, OK?

249
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:09,441
Miss, a glass of snifter, please.

250
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,810
Thanks.

251
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,891
Five euros.

252
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,327
Right.

253
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,084
Hey, lad, where are you going to sleep?

254
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,931
They told me there would be a room here.

255
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:41,763
That's true. But you're going to have to
ask Gusta nicely first, you young colt.

256
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,083
Room seven.

257
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,528
Up the stairs.

258
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,047
You can't miss it,
there's only one room.

259
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,447
Thanks.

260
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,530
I just have to fetch
a few things...

261
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,643
What a strange guy!
- He's gone.

262
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,047
What a really strange guy!

263
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,846
You must be stupid
to end up in the ditch.

264
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,724
He was fiddling with...

265
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:31,606
That isn't a triangle, is it?
- No, Roger, no...

266
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,965
Goodnight.

267
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,767
Are you sure you don't want to
sleep in your bed?

268
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,169
It's late, he's not going to come
any more, is he?

269
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,566
Right then.

270
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,210
God bless you and keep you, Gusta.

271
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,649
See you tomorrow morning.

272
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,847
Who locked this?

273
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,330
Right then.

274
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,849
Hey, pal, take it easy, take it easy.

275
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:19,761
There's no need to be scared.
You mustn't lock that.

276
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,642
Our Gusta has to be able to get to
the bathroom at night, see?

277
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,803
It's me again.

278
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:43,684
There, that's better.
Do you mind if I smoke a pipe?

279
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,205
There.

280
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:04,450
They say smoking isn't good for you.

281
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,769
But living isn't either,
because you end up dead.

282
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,169
Look at me.

283
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:16,126
I hope there isn't too much damage
to your car. You made me jump.

284
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,529
Normally people can't see me,
but you obviously can.

285
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:24,203
I thought you overreacted a bit.
You could have killed yourself.

286
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:27,889
Those motorized vehicles
are dangerous, you know.

287
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,526
You need to be careful with them.

288
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:36,727
I remember an attack on Dikkebusch,
18 September 1917.

289
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:40,208
The Prussians had obviously received
a new load of ammunition

290
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,404
and they wanted to try it out
on us, of course.

291
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,321
Hour after hour,
grenades raining down on us.

292
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,841
Shrapnel flying past our ears.

293
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:54,967
Florent, my pal, was lying next
to me. His last day at the front.

294
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,925
And, would you believe it?
A grenade landed on him.

295
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:03,001
The bottom half of his body was ripped
from the top half. In two bits.

296
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:09,082
His intestines, his stomach, everything,
was floating in a pool of blood.

297
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:13,885
And he looked at me,
what was left of him, and he said,

298
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,048
"Prosper, shoot me."

299
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:19,164
I said, "Florent..."
"Go on, shoot me."

300
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:23,367
And I drew my gun...

301
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,921
but before I could shoot him,
he was dead.

302
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,324
And then all that machinery,
the tanks, appeared.

303
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,684
That was also a new invention.
They wanted to try that out on us too.

304
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:39,282
They drove right over Florent,
over all the bits.

305
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,767
His head got stuck
in the caterpillartracks.

306
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:45,124
I thought, that's not right,
so I crawled behind the tanks

307
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:49,689
and tried to pry his head out of
the caterpillartracks

308
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:55,011
but my arm suddenly got stuck
and I lost it. My arm.

309
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,365
I'm going to go now.
I can see you're tired.

310
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,008
I'll let you get some sleep.

311
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,209
Lay on the left side of the bed,

312
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:15,201
there are too many springs that can
stick in your back on the right side.

313
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,124
Goodnight, my friend.

314
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,120
The button activates
the pheromone stimulators

315
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:21,086
which, thanks to the Aeroflex speakers,
produce a natural sound.

316
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:25,082
The robot has a state-of-the-art
SV-54 smell diffusion system

317
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,647
with a refillable cartridge.

318
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:31,287
Press button C. Press button C.

319
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:40,691
The robot can be connected to the outlets
via a cord that is supplied separately.

320
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,124
The robot can be connected to the outlets
via a cord that is supplied separately.

321
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,525
Good morning.

322
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,961
Oh, good morning.
What do I owe you?

323
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,281
250 euro.
- 250 euro?

324
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,641
Breakfast included.

325
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,245
That's not exactly cheap
for a small room like that.

326
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,091
Is there something wrong with the room?
- No, no.

327
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,568
It's just that you'd expect
a bit more luxury for that price.

328
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,286
You can't exactly
describe that room as special.

329
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,049
Did it have to be special?

330
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,890
Shall I tell you something?

331
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:25,482
Madonna, the singer,
slept there in 1980.

332
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,083
Is that special enough?

333
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,771
Madonna? Upstairs?

334
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:37,247
Yes. Upstairs.
In room seven. In your bed.

335
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,488
She was a background dancer.

336
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:45,161
With Patrick Hernandez.
- OK...

337
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,644
Deal.

338
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,527
I slept well, although...

339
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,724
I had a bit of a strange dream
about a soldier.

340
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,570
What did you dream?

341
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,366
Oh, nothing, nothing.
I often have strange dreams.

342
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,524
Especially when I'm hungry.

343
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,281
Our pork brawn is the best in the area.

344
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:20,444
Madonna is crazy about it. She regularly
has five kilos sent to America.

345
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,769
Doesn't she live in England?
- Does it matter where she lives?

346
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:27,567
If Madonna prefers to have it sent
to America, that's her business.

347
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,808
Oh, right. Yes, of course.

348
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,926
Very nice.

349
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,251
Right...

350
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,842
I've got to go now, Gusta.
I'll come and get you this afternoon.

351
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,484
Do you take credit cards?

352
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,650
I can pay cash but I'd like to
hang on to my bills.

353
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,328
Only cash.
Leave it on the bar when you go.

354
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,842
OK, I will, Miss.
- Maria.

355
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,804
Tony.

356
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,771
Right, adieu.

357
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,280
What?
- See you later, maybe.

358
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,363
Oh no, I'm leaving for the Ardennes.

359
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,609
Once my van's been pulled out
of the ditch, I'll be off.

360
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,924
Right. Toodle-oo.

361
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,967
Oh, him there.

362
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:04,767
Good morning. Is there a hotspot
for my iPhone here anywhere?

363
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,566
Hotspot, what's that?
- A what?

364
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:12,163
A hotspot. For my iPhone.

365
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,845
Are you on steroids or something?
- No.

366
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,122
But I need to make an urgent phone call.

367
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:22,290
What do you think
that phone booth is there for?

368
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,329
Hello.

369
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:47,168
I've come to get my van
pulled out of the ditch.

370
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,647
I'm on strike.
- Pardon?

371
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,888
I'm on strike.

372
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,286
Yesterday you said...
- Yesterday was yesterday,

373
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:58,723
today is today.
A strike can't be predicted.

374
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:02,925
If you don't help me, I will lose
my job and my future wife too, maybe.

375
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:07,284
Then I've got good news. There may be
a vacancy for a pump attendant soon.

376
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,960
And if you lose your wife
you can have mine.

377
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,926
Are you going to help me?
- No, I'm on strike.

378
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:19,842
If I don't show solidarity with
myself, I can't ask others to.

379
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,247
You look like
you didn't sleep very well.

380
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,840
Listen...

381
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,205
I'll give you 300 euros

382
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:38,282
to forget your principles for 10 minutes
and start up your towtruck and help me.

383
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,130
Then you can carry on striking.

384
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,767
Is there a hole in the wall here?
- A what?

385
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,241
A cash dispenser.

386
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,329
In Ypres, 30 km away.

387
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,246
30 km...
How can I leave today then?

388
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,681
You can't.
Not until after the referendum.

389
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,291
But that's too late for me.

390
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,490
Look, the referendum is
officially planned for Sunday,

391
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,409
you can't change that.

392
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:09,126
What if the vote doesn't go
the way you want?

393
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,485
I'll set fire to my pumps
and they can all kiss my ass.

394
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:15,047
Then you'll be in luck,
there will be a vacancy.

395
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,811
What?

396
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:02,410
Feel the power, Tony. The jungle
is dark but it's full of diamonds.

397
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,851
To war!

398
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,329
What do you think of that?

399
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:20,526
The guided tour starts next door.
- I've come about something else.

400
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,208
Come on. Hold on. Take a seat.

401
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,928
Come on. Come on, come on.

402
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:30,566
Close your eyes.

403
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,685
Open your eyes.

404
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:42,770
I don't need any modern art
in my museum.

405
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:43,927
It's not modern art.

406
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:47,767
It's a machine that is going to
change the art of pig breeding.

407
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:50,367
Anyway, talking of modern,

408
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:56,002
I can see you're an enlightened farmer.
We like that at Com.Sales.

409
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:00,800
Take a good look.

410
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:06,691
That animal is going to
change your life.

411
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,726
Let that pig loose in your sty and your
boars will perform like never before.

412
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:13,730
Your sows will get pregnant...
just like that.

413
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,410
It is very easy to use.

414
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:20,003
You just sit in your chair, press the
button on the remote control and...

415
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,247
off it goes.

416
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,364
It makes a natural mating sound
thanks to its Aeroflex speakers

417
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:28,770
and it has a state-of-the-art
SV-54 smell diffusion system

418
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,806
with a cartridge. Supplied separately
at a very interesting price.

419
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,885
You can connect him to the outlets
using this cable.

420
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:40,409
But you won't need to do that very often
as the battery lasts at least two weeks.

421
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,011
I can see that you realize
that this is the future.

422
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:51,047
So I'm prepared to do
something special for you.

423
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:54,608
You can have Porki for
a one month trial period...

424
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,450
free of charge.

425
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:02,201
I'm saying it quietly because my boss
mustn't hear it. Understand?

426
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:06,769
And if you sign a contract now,
you get a 20% discount the first year.

427
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,042
And 20% the second year too.

428
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,325
What do you say to that?

429
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,045
I don't have pigs any more.

430
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:16,691
I don't have my pigs.

431
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,410
What about that barn?
- Empty. Completely empty.

432
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:28,048
Well, full of junk.
But no pigs.

433
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:33,651
That isn't actually open
to the public yet.

434
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,970
Let's go for it.

435
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:08,161
You say it's modern? And I can have it
for a one month trial period?

436
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:11,967
And then a 20% discount
three years in a row.

437
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:17,291
What do you think, Berta?
- WII it work, Pol? What do you think?

438
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:20,484
Do you really think
I'd come all the way from Brussels

439
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:23,160
to sell you something
that didn't work?

440
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:27,041
300 euro is a lot of money, of course.
- We'll do a deal.

441
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:31,006
We'll go to your barn now.
I'll switch my pig on.

442
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:37,128
If there is no result within five
minutes, I'll give you 100 euro. Cash.

443
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:41,445
You'll see. Within five minutes
your barn's windows will be...

444
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,805
steamed up.

445
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,964
Five minutes.

446
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:49,606
100 euro.

447
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:52,043
Alright then. We'll do that.

448
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:56,050
I always say you have to
move with the times.

449
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,568
Five minutes. And... start!

450
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:21,890
Where are your pigs?

451
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:24,287
Hanging up in a fridge somewhere.

452
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:28,485
Europe pays me to leave my barns empty.

453
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:33,084
Why didn't you tell me?
- You didn't ask.

454
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,442
Your five minutes are almost up.

455
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:39,807
I can't see any steamed-up windows yet.

456
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:42,930
And stop. Five minutes exactly.

457
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,649
Hi, baby.
- Tony! About time.

458
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:21,561
I've been trying to call you for ages.
I can't get a signal in this backwater.

459
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,286
You've got one now.
- I'm in a phone booth, with coins.

460
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,211
Oh, listen carefully,
my father's playing his banjo.

461
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:31,849
Oh, great. Great. It sounds good.
- Don't disappoint him.

462
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,361
No, no, no, I'm coming.
I'm definitely coming.

463
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:38,201
I'll just be a bit late, I think...
tomorrow at the latest.

464
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,404
What do you mean, tomorrow?
No, Mom, I'll figure it out.

465
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:44,922
Baby, you promised me you'd...
- I know, baby, but I'm stuck here,

466
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:48,329
I've had an accident.
- An accident? Are you hurt?

467
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:52,127
No, I'm OK, you know me.
My van needs to be repaired.

468
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:55,085
Otherwise I'll come to you.
Where are you staying?

469
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:58,966
I'm staying in a small hotel
where Madonna once stayed.

470
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:00,241
Have you snorted something?

471
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,210
No, seriously,
the singer once slept in my bed.

472
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,209
Baby, are you really alright?

473
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:08,131
Yes, I'm alright.
But I did have a strange dream.

474
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:10,084
A strange dream? What about?

475
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:12,601
About a dead soldier
from World War One.

476
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,246
Tony. There's something wrong...

477
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:19,810
Hello? Hello, Bea? Baby?

478
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,207
Hello?

479
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,970
Hello? Bea, hello?

480
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:42,970
Bloody hell!

481
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,688
Gusta, I've got your dressing gown.

482
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,529
So you haven't left then?

483
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:34,651
Shall we get out?

484
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:38,481
No... I've decided not to leave
until tomorrow.

485
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,851
There's a 100 euro discount
from the second night,

486
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:44,964
coffee and continental breakfast
included.

487
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:49,403
What is a continental breakfast?

488
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:53,568
A pork brawn sandwich.

489
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:57,924
There is also a special local breakfast,
that's 8 euros extra.

490
00:51:58,120 --> 00:51:59,770
Oh, and what's that?

491
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,803
Two pork brawn sandwiches.

492
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:04,968
Right, Gusta, come on,
let's get out now.

493
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,682
That's it. Watch out.

494
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:31,001
Sorry, but... is there a restaurant
around here anywhere?

495
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:34,968
There's a place that does
a table d'hôte.

496
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:38,890
Once outside, go straight ahead
along Dorpsstraat,

497
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:41,686
across the square to the church,
through the graveyard,

498
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:45,965
then with the church behind you
and the school to your right,

499
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,367
look left and
you'll see a small house.

500
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:52,724
Go over to it, ring the bell
and say I sent you.

501
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:56,561
Make sure you're there at nine on
the dot, if you want something to eat.

502
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:00,884
Come on, I'll help you.

503
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:03,686
Come here, Gusta, I'll help you.

504
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:07,241
Are you going to keep that shower hat on?

505
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:22,527
I'm going to do your nails too.
Watch out. Go on.

506
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,010
Good evening.

507
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:58,561
We have a dish of the day for 25 euros,
drink included.

508
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:02,444
Come in.

509
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:10,524
Do you live here?

510
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:19,802
We've got another guest this evening.
My great-granny, Gusta.

511
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:23,647
Maria, actually I wanted to...
- I have to check on the food.

512
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,729
Maria, I...

513
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:40,411
How are you, is everything fine?

514
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:21,651
You made me jump! Bloody hell!

515
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:23,928
Never seen a dead man before,
I suppose?

516
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:27,960
Come with me.

517
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,124
Straight ahead.

518
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:35,850
You're going to help me.

519
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:39,725
I am definitely not crazy.
I am not crazy.

520
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:44,205
I've been seeing Prosper's ghost
for years. He's my great-grandpa.

521
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,050
His bones are out in the fields

522
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:49,961
amongst 100,000 other dead soldiers
who've never been dug up.

523
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:55,163
But his ghost wanders around here
and he pops in every evening at 9.

524
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:57,846
I tried talking to my doctor about it.

525
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:01,567
He said it was nervous exhaustion and
wanted to send me to the nut house.

526
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,730
But you see him too, eh? So he's real.

527
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:08,049
And you just walked through him.
- No, no, no, calm down.

528
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,129
Calm down. This is getting
a bit too freaky for my liking.

529
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:15,961
There's too much iodine in the air here,
it makes you hallucinate.

530
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:18,322
I know it sounds ridiculous,
but it's true.

531
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:22,804
Or LSD. The CIA carried out
military tests with LSD in the fifties.

532
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:27,928
They dropped LSD by plane on a village
in France to see how people reacted.

533
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:32,649
Tony, my great-granny doesn't want
to die until she's found Prosper's body

534
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:35,168
and given him a decent burial.

535
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:38,410
I've been searching the battlefields
for his bones for years.

536
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:41,206
But to no avail up till now.

537
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:45,565
That doesn't mean I don't appreciate
her efforts, you know. On the contrary.

538
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:46,761
But you need luck too.

539
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,884
I've already found ten bodies
but not Prosper's.

540
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,527
And now his ghost walks
around here, whistling.

541
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:55,724
But I'm sure his remains are
out there somewhere.

542
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,570
Absolutely, affirmative.

543
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:01,209
If she could find
my right arm for starters, it'd be good.

544
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:05,007
One arm's impractical. There's lots
I can't do. I was a good swimmer.

545
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,771
They want to build a road
through the battlefields.

546
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:11,123
Tony, you've got to help me and Gusta
find Prosper.

547
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:13,562
Before a bulldozer pulverizes him.

548
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:15,125
I'd really appreciate it.

549
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:18,410
His bones must be here
in a field somewhere.

550
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:22,207
That reminds me of...
- Leave us alone for a moment.

551
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:25,882
Hey, take it easy.
All you need do is say so calmly.

552
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:28,329
I know when I'm not wanted.

553
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:31,922
Easy, Tony, easy. Come on.
You can hear a banjo, very quietly,

554
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:35,090
and a gurgling river.
Bea is putting the sleeping bags out.

555
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:38,887
You throw some wood on the fire, then
you're going to ask Bea to marry you.

556
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:41,401
Come on, come on.

557
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:44,080
I think the food is ready.

558
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:08,208
And he destroyed our phone booth.

559
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:09,606
Seriously?
- Yes.

560
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:12,089
That pig of his isn't kosher.

561
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:16,922
He went to see Nachtegaele too.
- And what's-his-name... Vanwachtebeke.

562
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:20,569
He tried to bribe him,
with lots of money.

563
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:23,445
Yeah, it's... there's something
that doesn't add up.

564
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:28,043
Roger, something's wrong. Something's
wrong and now he's at Maria's.

565
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:31,881
Now he's at Maria's, a beautiful girl.
It's a crying shame.

566
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:34,924
Maria, as obstinate as her father,
such a shame.

567
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:36,770
You know what I think about it, eh?

568
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:39,770
You shouldn’t judge people
by appearances. Never.

569
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:44,443
That's true, Roger.
I love all my villagers equally.

570
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:45,607
Yeah. Yeah.

571
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:47,404
Every one of them.
- That's good.

572
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:50,809
There's something special about Maria.
- No, Jean-Pierre.

573
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,209
Something special.
That's like with sheep.

574
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,926
What do you mean?
- Well, you love all your sheep

575
00:59:57,120 --> 01:00:00,169
equally too, eh? But sometimes
one stands out from the rest.

576
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:04,001
That... That only happened once.
And it was simply an accident.

577
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:07,124
That sheep was standing in front of me
and fell on top of me.

578
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:09,402
I'm not suggesting anything.

579
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:12,126
I didn't know that you...
- That I what?

580
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:51,531
It's nice. I don't recognize
the taste but it's nice.

581
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:56,487
Flemish ratatouille.
Gusta's favorite meal, eh Gusta?

582
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:03,886
Tripe with potatoes, boiled in coffee.

583
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:08,366
Tripe?

584
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:11,606
Intestines.

585
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,722
That reminds me.

586
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:23,244
Did I tell you how I lost my arm?

587
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:26,888
It was ripped off by caterpillartracks.

588
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:31,127
That took me by surprise.
But there...

589
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:34,646
Those are things...
- You should eat something, Gusta.

590
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:38,242
The Prussians' grenades
were raining down on our head.

591
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:40,966
British tanks were behind us.

592
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:43,925
So I thought, I've got to do something.

593
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:46,600
Then I jumped in a crater
made by a grenade

594
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:50,167
but I wasn't the only one in it.

595
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:54,365
There were two Prussians in it too.

596
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:59,851
They obviously had the same idea,
a few weeks before.

597
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:02,842
It was an unusual sight.

598
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:07,091
Let’s just say
there wasn't much left of them.

599
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:12,883
A sort of blood and guts soup,

600
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:19,250
with ripped off arms, bits of bone
and eyes floating in it.

601
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:21,841
German tripe.

602
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,688
I could... I could see
they were Prussian eyes.

603
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:30,890
The look in them.

604
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:35,122
There's something special about eyes.

605
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:42,729
Ding dong! Ding dong! Open the door.

606
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:47,325
Maria! Open the door, please!

607
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:52,891
Hello! It's your pal at the door. Hello!

608
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:57,002
Oh, Maria, my angel. My cherub.

609
01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:00,522
Wrap your wings round me...

610
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:04,406
Ask your wife to do that with her wings.
And keep your voice down.

611
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:07,604
Your Worship...
- Listen to me, you beautiful child.

612
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:11,771
I'm not a child. And I'm not listening.
And I've got a visitor.

613
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:16,726
Who's in your house? Eh?
- Ugh, you stinking toad! Goodnight!

614
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:22,405
Open the door! Hey! Hurry up,
open the door! Open the door...

615
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:26,525
Listen carefully.
If you and I could have a good talk,

616
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,846
like two adults, we would be able to
save ourselves and everyone else

617
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:34,965
lots and lots and lots of bother
and lots of misery on Sunday.

618
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:40,644
We'll talk about it tomorrow morning.
- No... Maria! Maria!

619
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:46,084
Some soldiers' eyes were burnt away
by the mustard gas.

620
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:48,845
Can you imagine?

621
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,168
What's up?
- I've got to go.

622
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:55,047
Have you had enough already?
You've hardly eaten anything.

623
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:56,685
Do you want a drink?
- It's late.

624
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:59,770
A coffee?
- No, I have to get up early tomorrow.

625
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:03,365
No!

626
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:09,531
Tony...
help me find him.

627
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:13,121
I'll leave the money on the bar.

628
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:30,604
You don't belong here, pal.
And leave my woman alone.

629
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:41,566
If it were up to me I'd be long gone.
Everyone's as mad as a hatter here!

630
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:45,003
Hey, pal...
- Fuck, man.

631
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:51,683
You will go down on bended knee
and apologize to Our Lady and say

632
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:54,811
you should never have come
to our village.

633
01:04:58,160 --> 01:04:59,764
You can say that again.

634
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:08,642
Fancy it coming to this.

635
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,771
Hooligans in Madonna.

636
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:20,851
Didn't you recognize the boys?
- No, Mother. It was dark.

637
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:23,646
Listen to me, sweetheart,
I'll tell you something.

638
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:26,605
It's a bad time
for decent people like us.

639
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:28,609
That's enough, that's enough.

640
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:57,524
Haven't left yet then?

641
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:04,767
Do you have the number of
a local taxi?

642
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:06,405
Yes.

643
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:12,321
Can you give it to me?
- No, I'm on strike. Still.

644
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:20,007
Can I make a phone call from here?

645
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:24,442
There's a phone booth by the church.

646
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,128
It's broken.
- Right.

647
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:37,209
May I use your shovel?

648
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:41,764
I don't have one.
- What's that then?

649
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:44,490
That's a spade.

650
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:51,089
May I use your spade, please?

651
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:52,760
Yes.

652
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:02,481
Thank you.

653
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:05,126
You're welcome.
It's always a pleasure to help.

654
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:07,523
See, I'm not contrary.

655
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:06,329
Hello.

656
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:19,446
I may have overdone it a bit yesterday.

657
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:22,007
I can understand that
you're a bit confused.

658
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:25,848
A bit confused, a bit confused...

659
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:30,891
A day and a half ago
my life was absolutely fine.

660
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:33,321
Then, suddenly,
I end up in the boondocks.

661
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:38,287
In a hotel with only one room where
Madonna is supposed to have stayed.

662
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:44,168
Pig farms everywhere where they've got
everything except... pigs.

663
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:47,929
Plus a drunk mayor, who's a vet,

664
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:50,088
who can't keep his hands off the women.

665
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:53,443
You could call that local color.

666
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:58,965
But being expected to believe in a dead
soldier who walks around here whistling,

667
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:02,005
sorry, but that’s just a bit too
over the top for me.

668
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:05,649
I'm not just a bit confused,
I think I must have a screw loose.

669
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:07,968
And I've probably lost my job too.

670
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:13,485
Meanwhile, my fiancee has been waiting
in the Ardennes for me for two days.

671
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:15,802
Who calls his girlfriend his fiancee?

672
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:24,765
Do you know what I want to do?
Make one phone call.

673
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:28,965
Just one call, to my fiancee,
to tell her I'll be late,

674
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:33,927
to say our life together can begin after
this and we'll soon forget this weekend.

675
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:40,769
Watch out for shells. The ditches are
full of unexploded ammunition.

676
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:04,520
You're crazy, pal!

677
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,240
Maria...

678
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:18,365
Maria...

679
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:20,440
Maria...

680
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:24,926
Maria, sorry.

681
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:50,204
Maria, sorry.

682
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:56,680
You don't understand shit, do you?

683
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:59,770
Here, in the boondocks,
where we crawl around,

684
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:03,043
you may not find a hotspot,
but people live here.

685
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:06,046
A little bit of respect
wouldn't go amiss.

686
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:11,691
There's a cell phone tower on
the church spire but it's switched off.

687
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:14,008
They installed it to get a grant

688
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:18,330
and the mayor, the vet, the womanizer,
had it switched off

689
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:21,046
because the radiation is bad
for the cows' milk.

690
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:23,686
We live here with the animals.

691
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:26,611
If you have a very long ladder,
you can switch it on.

692
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:29,201
Call your future wife,
ask her to come and get you.

693
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:33,644
This evening you'll be sitting on your
father-in-law's lap playing his banjo.

694
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:38,085
Farewell, Tony Roozen.

695
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:50,410
Hey! Hey, you scoundrel!

696
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:56,764
Do you have permission to do that?
That's church property.

697
01:14:57,120 --> 01:15:03,446
Hey! Hey! Get down from there, now!
Get down!

698
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:06,805
What audacity!
- We need the police.

699
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,684
Valère! Where's Valère?

700
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:11,884
Didn't you hear what the mayor said?

701
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:14,560
Get down from there.
- Did you hear that?

702
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:18,561
What nerve! Does anyone have a gun?
A gun? Then I can shoot him down.

703
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:22,801
Calm down, Jean-Pierre.
He'll fall off in a minute.

704
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:26,562
Bea.
- Oh, you are still alive?

705
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:30,647
I'm not sure.
- What? What aren't you sure about?

706
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:32,365
Get down from there immediately.

707
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:36,681
Jean-Pierre, be careful with that gun.
What are you doing?

708
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:39,611
Just come to the Ardennes,
because I am really...

709
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:43,361
Final warning. Get down from there now
or I'll shoot.

710
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:46,040
Please, just come to the Ardennes now.

711
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:49,050
I'm not asking you twice.

712
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:53,086
I can't. I can't get away from here.

713
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:55,521
Come now, or don't
bother coming. Please.

714
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:56,801
I'm going to shoot.

715
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,570
Bea, I...
- Tony...

716
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:05,247
Take it easy! Oh, fuck. Take it easy.
I'm coming down, I'm coming down.

717
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:11,204
Come on, get in there. Go on.

718
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:53,922
Here's your jacket.
It was still on your motor car.

719
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:56,085
It can get cold here at night.

720
01:16:56,560 --> 01:17:00,724
You might catch something and get ill
and then you'll die.

721
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:25,005
Nice ring.

722
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:53,720
It was in November, in '17.
I just had a few days' leave.

723
01:17:53,920 --> 01:18:00,087
Gusta and I spent three days
in each other's arms. Room 7.

724
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:05,366
She was pregnant then
but I had to go back to the front.

725
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:07,881
To the trenches, in the rain.

726
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:14,922
It was a Monday.
It had been quiet all day. Silent.

727
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:18,171
And we were in our trenches...

728
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:22,001
And everyone knew that something
had to happen, it was too quiet.

729
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:25,925
And suddenly, on the dot of nine...

730
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:30,088
the rats all ran out of
their holes at the same time

731
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:34,490
and I went to see and... it was gas.

732
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:39,840
Floating towards us
like morning mist across the fields.

733
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:41,405
The yellow death.

734
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:44,971
The Prussians had bombarded us
with mustard gas.

735
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:47,686
And we didn't have any gas masks, so...

736
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:50,966
But I was close to the latrines.

737
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:57,406
The hole full of shit
and mud and rotting remains.

738
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:01,407
I jumped into the latrine.

739
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:05,605
It was the only way,
the only place to flee to.

740
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:11,125
Gusta had given me a hankie
embroidered with roses.

741
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:15,609
I just had time to tie it
over my mouth and then I jumped in.

742
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:20,645
Until I was desperate for breath
and had to come back up.

743
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:25,004
I wanted to take a breath of air
but I couldn't.

744
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:32,200
It was as if boiling acid was being
poured down my throat. It burnt.

745
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:37,290
Then I sank back down
into the latrine again.

746
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:39,924
And suddenly it was over.

747
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:45,330
I remember thinking,
"Bloody hell, is that it?"

748
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:50,805
In my mind I saw Gusta lying there,

749
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:57,201
with her bulging belly, beautiful.
Dammit!

750
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:00,681
I could look into her belly
for a moment.

751
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:04,967
That baby was lying there peacefully.

752
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:11,844
It was a little boy.

753
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:17,967
I thought of Gusta's eyes.

754
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:25,402
Do you know what the worst thing was?

755
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:31,485
That I wasn't able to say goodbye.

756
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:35,851
To say "thanks"...

757
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:42,604
"take care" and "I love you".

758
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:49,889
That's how it goes, pal.

759
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:23,524
SCHOOL DIES = MADONNA DIES
REFERENDUM = SWINDLE

760
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:26,720
Dear parishioners,

761
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:31,603
does our Madonna's plinth
really need to be opened?

762
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:38,290
Should the secrets we have entrusted
to Our Holy Mother for years

763
01:21:40,280 --> 01:21:42,567
just be revealed to everyone?

764
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:47,527
No one knows, no one knows, how much
weight is lifted off my shoulders

765
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:53,921
knowing that you can tell that statue
everything that is bothering you,

766
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:59,411
so that I have my hands free for
the real work of a parish shepherd.

767
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:04,604
Dear parishioners...
Thank you. Good boy.

768
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:13,088
We are living in a vulnerable community.

769
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:20,289
And your love and your gentleness
should not be disturbed

770
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:24,883
by the aggressive intervention
of an outsider.

771
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:28,368
We must be on our guard
till the very end.

772
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:39,764
Go on, get out of here.
Get out of here.

773
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:46,045
Marcel.
- Hi.

774
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:22,571
Right, everyone.

775
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:29,160
Having said this, before we vote, I'm
giving the final word to Maria Glorie,

776
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:32,728
who, in spite of the fact that
she calls the referendum a swindle,

777
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:36,208
has still graced us
with her dazzling presence.

778
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:40,883
Like every speaker,
she will get exactly sixty seconds.

779
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:42,491
Nestor.

780
01:25:43,480 --> 01:25:47,724
I'm not going to repeat myself.
The choice is yours.

781
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:51,208
If one more pupil leaves,
there's no longer a legal basis

782
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:53,641
for keeping the school in Madonna open.

783
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:57,324
Our school has been here
for two hundred years.

784
01:25:57,520 --> 01:26:02,003
I don't expect you to
all start having children...

785
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:05,807
so I can only hope for new inhabitants.

786
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:08,924
But I also want to fight
to protect the battlefields.

787
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:15,085
Do we still remember how many people
died to protect this piece of ground?

788
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:18,329
Between 8 and 10 million.

789
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:21,808
Many of whom are still missing.

790
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:28,042
Your fathers, grandfathers and
great-grandfathers are under our feet.

791
01:26:28,240 --> 01:26:35,522
You can hear them, crawling around,
breathing, looking for a way out.

792
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:42,242
It is our duty to them to ensure
that there is still a school in Madonna,

793
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:46,445
and that tons of concrete
aren't poured on their grave.

794
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:59,406
So I think the widening of
the old road is a good thing.

795
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:03,045
And the crossroads being relaid...

796
01:27:03,240 --> 01:27:07,290
I agree, Your Worship, it is absurd.

797
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:10,484
But what is the problem?
- 60 seconds, stop.

798
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:14,446
Are you so scared of the plinth being
removed from the statue of Madonna?

799
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:16,563
Who here has something to hide?

800
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:19,240
Hey, 60 seconds is 60 seconds!

801
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:22,330
We're going to vote.
Come on, let's start.

802
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:48,481
Mr Van Theun, priest.

803
01:27:49,160 --> 01:27:51,242
Mr Huysseune, mayor.

804
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:54,042
Marcel Goegebeure.

805
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:58,962
Germaine... Paul Nachtegaele.
Berta Nachtegaele.

806
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:03,769
Melanie Verbrugge. Maria Glorie.

807
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:24,602
A SOLDIER'S RIPPED-OFF ARM

808
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:21,444
Well I'll be damned...

809
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:26,050
Thirty-six.

810
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:30,284
Thirty-seven.

811
01:30:33,080 --> 01:30:34,650
Thirty-eight.

812
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:38,131
Thirty-nine.

813
01:30:39,160 --> 01:30:40,844
Forty.

814
01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:52,363
Are we ready, pal? Let's see.
Right, thanks, Nestor.

815
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:56,363
Attention. Your attention, please.

816
01:30:56,560 --> 01:31:01,566
Dear inhabitants of Madonna,
democracy has spoken this evening.

817
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:06,721
Forty valid voting papers
have been counted. Here is the result.

818
01:31:08,920 --> 01:31:11,241
Against the widening of the old road

819
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:15,445
and therefore the unnecessary conversion
of the crossroads

820
01:31:15,640 --> 01:31:18,803
into a roundabout: 34 votes.

821
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,207
For: 5 votes. Blank: 1 vote.

822
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:26,406
The proposal is therefore rejected.
Everything stays as it was.

823
01:31:26,600 --> 01:31:28,284
Right. Right, right.

824
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:32,248
That means we won't agree to
Brussels' request

825
01:31:32,440 --> 01:31:35,842
but will submit a proposal
to lay a new main road

826
01:31:36,160 --> 01:31:39,607
to Madonna. Well done!
- Jerk.

827
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:46,768
What's the matter, Gusta?

828
01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:12,286
Tony...

829
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:29,561
Look at you. Where have you
been all this time? Eh?

830
01:35:30,240 --> 01:35:32,447
Berta?
- What, Pol?

831
01:35:32,640 --> 01:35:34,449
That's your handwriting.

832
01:35:36,160 --> 01:35:41,769
May 1974.
Dear Mary, Mother of God...

833
01:35:42,040 --> 01:35:48,764
Dear Madonna,
Sometimes I want to strangle my wife...

834
01:35:49,080 --> 01:35:51,162
I've come to confess to you.

835
01:35:51,360 --> 01:35:56,287
I'm carrying Pol Nachtegaele's child
but I don't love the man.

836
01:35:56,600 --> 01:36:00,571
Dear Madonna, I am crazy about
the village school teacher.

837
01:36:00,760 --> 01:36:02,603
I've had enough of my wife...

838
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:09,764
I imagine myself
at her funeral and I feel happy.

839
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:13,766
What do I do?
Roland Vanwachtebeke.

840
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:19,565
I don't know how much longer
I can put up with her. The mayor.

841
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:22,522
Is room 7 still free?

842
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:26,884
No. I'm sleeping there tonight.

843
01:38:52,480 --> 01:38:54,562
But you can join me.

844
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:35,051
Pol, look. Look.

845
01:44:16,680 --> 01:44:18,364
Oh, Pol...

846
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:56,448
My good mate Roger De Bakker,
who was in the trenches with me in '16,

847
01:44:56,640 --> 01:45:01,123
he told me.
He said that, after Ostend, Dinant

848
01:45:01,320 --> 01:45:03,322
is the most beautiful town in the world.

849
01:45:03,520 --> 01:45:06,046
He knew all about it
because he rode a motorcycle.

850
01:45:06,240 --> 01:45:08,811
So I suggest that we go to Dinant first

851
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:12,288
and maybe get a discount on
our honeymoon.

852
01:45:12,480 --> 01:45:17,566
And then, if we get that far,
there is a waterfall at Coo, apparently.

853
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:20,764
At least 15 meters high,
right out in the country...

854
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:23,327
We can have a nice photo taken there.

855
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:26,091
Eh? What do you reckon?
