00:12:36,536 --> 00:12:37,734
Okay. I'll call you Friday.

179
00:12:37,769 --> 00:12:40,868

181
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,968
Did you find what
you were looking for?

182
00:12:46,003 --> 00:12:48,167
By golly, I did!

183
00:12:48,202 --> 00:12:51,868
A first edition
of <i>Great Expectations.</i>

184
00:12:51,903 --> 00:12:53,868
By golly, I didn't
know we had one.

185
00:12:53,903 --> 00:12:56,067
[laughs]
Oh.

186
00:12:56,102 --> 00:12:59,834
Oh, there's no price
in here and--

187
00:12:59,869 --> 00:13:01,100
You know what?
We have this policy--

188
00:13:01,135 --> 00:13:04,467
Ring me up
when you sort it out!

189
00:13:04,502 --> 00:13:06,434
Wait!

190
00:13:06,469 --> 00:13:08,667
I don't have your number!

00:15:13,702 --> 00:15:15,767
What's with you?

228
00:15:15,802 --> 00:15:17,801
Oh, please tell me
you met a man.

229
00:15:17,836 --> 00:15:19,400
Oh, I met a man,
all right.

230
00:15:19,435 --> 00:15:21,601
Thank you, Jesus!

231
00:15:21,636 --> 00:15:23,067
He wore a cape
and a top hat

232
00:15:23,102 --> 00:15:24,834
and he sawed me
in half.

233
00:15:24,869 --> 00:15:27,133
Is that some kind
of code for sex?

234
00:15:27,168 --> 00:15:28,200
No, silly.

235
00:15:28,235 --> 00:15:30,133
I went to a magic show
last night.

236
00:15:30,168 --> 00:15:31,234
And you met a man there?

237
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:33,567
No man, just magic.

238
00:15:34,968 --> 00:15:38,601
Well, once you find
real magic...

239
00:15:38,636 --> 00:15:41,267
pulling bunnies out of hats
isn't going to cut it anymore.

240
00:15:41,302 --> 00:15:42,267
Love, schmove.

241
00:15:42,302 --> 00:15:43,300
Blueberry pie today.

242
00:15:43,335 --> 00:15:45,100
Yummy.

243
00:17:29,534 --> 00:17:31,734

How's it goin'?
You're lookin' good.

255
00:18:00,335 --> 00:18:01,367
Hey, come on.
You hungry?

256
00:18:01,402 --> 00:18:02,834
I bet you're starving.
Come over.

257
00:18:02,869 --> 00:18:04,868
I made you lasagna,
your favorite
with the sausage.

258
00:18:04,903 --> 00:18:06,701
Come on.
Ooh, yummies!

259
00:18:06,736 --> 00:18:08,667
I have work to do,
though.

00:18:08,702 --> 00:18:11,033
Typie, typie.
All work and no play.

261
00:18:11,068 --> 00:18:12,934
All right,
I'll bring it over
in a Tupperware,

262
00:18:12,969 --> 00:18:14,033
but, hey,
I want it back.

263
00:18:14,068 --> 00:18:15,033
Don't forget.

264
00:18:15,068 --> 00:18:17,267
I love those little guys.

00:18:20,736 --> 00:18:23,968
Um, Maggie, uh...

267
00:18:24,003 --> 00:18:25,868
I have to, uh--

268
00:18:25,903 --> 00:18:27,267
You see, the thing is--

269
00:18:27,302 --> 00:18:28,601
Wait.

270
00:18:28,636 --> 00:18:31,434
You don't have to say
I'm late with the rent again.

271
00:18:31,469 --> 00:18:32,801
Sorry.

272
00:18:32,836 --> 00:18:34,434
I'll have it by Tuesday.

273
00:18:34,469 --> 00:18:35,434

274
00:18:35,469 --> 00:18:37,067

that lasagna.

You're the best!

277
00:18:40,068 --> 00:18:42,300
I don't know about that.

279
00:18:54,701 --> 00:18:56,400
Not today, Angus.

280
00:19:00,234 --> 00:19:02,200
Hi!

281
00:19:02,235 --> 00:19:03,767
It's your day off,
remember?

282
00:19:03,802 --> 00:19:06,467
I know. I'm just
looking for something.

283
00:19:06,502 --> 00:19:07,901
What are you
looking for, silly.

284
00:19:07,936 --> 00:19:09,934
Well, it's-- it's a book,
but it's not really a book.

285
00:19:09,969 --> 00:19:11,567
It's kind of like
what should be inside it

286
00:19:11,602 --> 00:19:12,934
if-- if the lamp
was real.

287
00:19:12,969 --> 00:19:14,667
Oh, you're just
talking crazy.

289
00:19:15,836 --> 00:19:17,334
I mean, it's got
to be here, right?

290
00:19:17,369 --> 00:19:19,267
You're supposed to get
three wishes, not two.

291
00:19:19,302 --> 00:19:21,400
Wishes?

292
00:19:21,435 --> 00:19:23,334
Have you seen that copy
of <i>Great Expectations?</i>

293
00:19:23,369 --> 00:19:26,367
Oddly enough,
someone bought it
this morning.

294
00:19:26,402 --> 00:19:29,334
Even odder, I didn't
even know we had it.

295
00:19:38,434 --> 00:19:40,601
That had my
third wish in it.

296
00:19:40,636 --> 00:19:43,400
What are you
talking about?

297
00:19:46,868 --> 00:19:49,300
Well, the other day,
I was bored out of my wit,

298
00:19:49,335 --> 00:19:51,467
so I kind of
rubbed this lamp
and I made a wish.

299
00:19:51,502 --> 00:19:52,467
Lamp?

300
00:19:52,502 --> 00:19:53,467
It sort of came true

301
00:19:53,502 --> 00:19:55,501
and I got this
magic show ticket

302
00:19:55,536 --> 00:19:57,801
and then I got to go
on an airplane ride.
Airplane?

303
00:19:57,836 --> 00:20:00,267
And you know how much
I love magic and I've
always wanted to fly.

304
00:20:00,302 --> 00:20:02,167
It was all in this
little book?

305
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:03,801
Yeah.

306
00:20:05,367 --> 00:20:07,801
It was magic.

307
00:20:07,836 --> 00:20:09,801
Magic?

308
00:20:09,836 --> 00:20:12,934
Yeah... magic.

309
00:20:12,969 --> 00:20:15,000
I don't know.
I just thought maybe...

310
00:20:16,634 --> 00:20:18,033
...somebody up there
was listening

311
00:20:18,068 --> 00:20:21,200
and thought I deserved
a little magic in my life.

312
00:20:21,235 --> 00:20:22,701
You know?

313
00:20:25,734 --> 00:20:27,567
Maybe so, dear.

314
00:20:27,602 --> 00:20:29,901
[chuckling]
Oh, maybe so.

315
00:20:31,567 --> 00:20:34,601
I hope your kids
know how lucky they are.

316
00:20:34,636 --> 00:20:37,567
Not those devil children.

317
00:20:37,602 --> 00:20:39,067
Mags, I've told you.

318
00:20:39,102 --> 00:20:41,767
Charlie and I
have adopted you.

319
00:20:41,802 --> 00:20:43,701
Yeah.

320
00:20:43,736 --> 00:20:46,801
Where were you
when I was four?

321
00:20:46,836 --> 00:20:48,934
Everything you
went through as a child

322
00:20:48,969 --> 00:20:52,901
has made you
the strong girl
you are today.

323
00:20:52,936 --> 00:20:55,167
Yeah.

324
00:20:55,202 --> 00:20:56,868
Strong as an ox.

325
00:20:58,701 --> 00:21:00,234
It just would have
been nice to have

326
00:21:00,269 --> 00:21:03,701
a mom around to,
I don't know...

327
00:21:03,736 --> 00:21:06,601
make me an Easter basket
or something.

328
00:21:10,267 --> 00:21:12,601
Just call me
Little Orphan Maggie.

329
00:21:12,636 --> 00:21:14,601
[chuckles softly]

330
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,767
I'm going to go.

331
00:21:20,734 --> 00:21:22,133
Mags?

332
00:21:23,601 --> 00:21:25,834
Are you okay?

333
00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:27,934
Yeah.

334
00:21:27,969 --> 00:21:30,434
Strong... ox. See?

335
00:21:32,033 --> 00:21:34,067
I'll see you
in the morning.

336
00:21:37,334 --> 00:21:38,734
[sighs]

337
00:22:33,567 --> 00:22:35,868
Oh, um, excuse me.

338
00:22:35,903 --> 00:22:38,434
I bought this book
yesterday.

339
00:22:38,469 --> 00:22:39,934
Yeah, we don't take returns.

340
00:22:39,969 --> 00:22:43,534
Um, no, actually,
I didn't wish to return it.

341
00:22:43,569 --> 00:22:44,801
I just wanted to--
You just what?

342
00:22:44,836 --> 00:22:46,534
Don't test my patience.
Not today.

343
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:52,968
Excuse me,
but are you always
this rude, Ms. Malone?

344
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,868
Do I know you?

345
00:22:58,903 --> 00:23:01,133
No.

346
00:23:01,168 --> 00:23:03,133
Well, then,
how do you know my name?

347
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:06,200
Are you a Dickens fan?

348
00:23:06,235 --> 00:23:08,300
What?

349
00:23:08,335 --> 00:23:11,734
I mean, that's a little
cryptic, isn't it?

350
00:23:11,769 --> 00:23:15,067
Oh, is that some sort
of British expression for--

351
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,601
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

352
00:23:16,636 --> 00:23:18,267
I don't know what
you're getting at, Mister,

353
00:23:18,302 --> 00:23:19,634
but if that's some
sort of creepy,

354
00:23:19,669 --> 00:23:22,334
weird sexual metaphor,
I'm not having it.

355
00:23:25,901 --> 00:23:27,234
Who are you?

356
00:23:27,269 --> 00:23:31,200
Well, I'm just
a, uh, messenger,

357
00:23:31,235 --> 00:23:32,667
for lack of a better word.

358
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:34,200
Have you read this book?
Well, yeah.

359
00:23:34,235 --> 00:23:36,868
I mean, not that
exact copy, but, yeah.

360
00:23:36,903 --> 00:23:40,601
Yes, well,
you have a great deal
in common with Pip.

361
00:23:40,636 --> 00:23:42,601
All right,
again with the cryptic.

362
00:23:42,636 --> 00:23:44,000
Now you're just
getting on my nerves.

363
00:23:44,035 --> 00:23:46,767
What in the Sam Hill
are you talking about?

364
00:23:46,802 --> 00:23:51,067
You, Maggie Malone,
have a benefactor.

365
00:23:51,102 --> 00:23:53,234
A what-efactor?

366
00:23:55,701 --> 00:23:57,734
A benefactor.

367
00:23:59,901 --> 00:24:02,067
Oh.

368
00:24:02,102 --> 00:24:03,334
This is like
one of those--

369
00:24:03,369 --> 00:24:05,133
those-- those setup,
joke thingies, right?

370
00:24:05,168 --> 00:24:06,434
And-- and, oh, my God!

371
00:24:06,469 --> 00:24:08,767
You're that
Jamie Kennedy guy
in disguise, right?

372
00:24:08,802 --> 00:24:10,434
Am I being exed
right now?

373
00:24:10,469 --> 00:24:11,834
Oh, my God,
where's the camera?

374
00:24:11,869 --> 00:24:14,467
Um, no, no.
Ms. Malone, this is, uh--

375
00:24:14,502 --> 00:24:15,901
This is very real.

376
00:24:17,734 --> 00:24:19,033
All right.

377
00:24:19,068 --> 00:24:20,501
Do I look like
I just fell off

378
00:24:20,536 --> 00:24:21,634
a turnip truck to you?

379
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:23,167
I'm so sorry,
I don't follow.

380
00:24:23,202 --> 00:24:25,467
I mean, do I look
like I have "sucker"

381
00:24:25,502 --> 00:24:26,734
tattooed on my forehead?

382
00:24:26,769 --> 00:24:28,601
Hmm?

383
00:24:28,636 --> 00:24:31,901
Not unless it's written
very small.

384
00:24:31,936 --> 00:24:35,167
I mean, do I seem
like an idiot to you?

385
00:24:35,202 --> 00:24:37,067
Oh, idiot! Yes.

386
00:24:37,102 --> 00:24:38,634
Um, no! Um--

387
00:24:38,669 --> 00:24:41,601
Look, madam, I'm simply
trying to do my job.

388
00:24:41,636 --> 00:24:44,033
There's really no need
for you to become hostile.

389
00:24:44,068 --> 00:24:45,367
Doing your job, huh?

390
00:24:45,402 --> 00:24:46,567
[chuckles]

391
00:24:46,602 --> 00:24:49,834
Isn't, like, Santa Claus
or the Tooth Fairy upset

392
00:24:49,869 --> 00:24:51,934
about you honing in
on their territory?

393
00:24:51,969 --> 00:24:52,934
What?

394
00:24:52,969 --> 00:24:55,400
[goofy laugh]
Oh! Oh, I see.

395
00:24:55,435 --> 00:24:57,334
An attempt at humor.

396
00:24:57,369 --> 00:24:59,734
No, I am actually
legal counsel

397
00:24:59,769 --> 00:25:01,501
for your benefactor.

398
00:25:03,868 --> 00:25:06,033
Okay.

399
00:25:06,068 --> 00:25:09,801
Let say...
hypothetically,

400
00:25:09,836 --> 00:25:12,834
that I believe you,
which I don't.

401
00:25:12,869 --> 00:25:14,133
What would happen?

402
00:25:14,168 --> 00:25:17,567
Well, uh, you get
to have anything
your heart desires.

403
00:25:19,334 --> 00:25:20,801
Yeah.

404
00:25:20,836 --> 00:25:22,767
Crazy talk.
Not buying it.

405
00:25:22,802 --> 00:25:24,467
Well, those are the rules.

406
00:25:24,502 --> 00:25:27,934
If you obtain the knowledge
of the identity

407
00:25:27,969 --> 00:25:32,234
of your benefactor,
you will forfeit everything.

408
00:25:32,269 --> 00:25:34,367
Is this the third wish.

409
00:25:34,402 --> 00:25:35,701
I'm sorry. Wish?

410
00:25:35,736 --> 00:25:37,701
Uh... nothing.

411
00:25:37,736 --> 00:25:39,467
I'm just talking
to myself.

412
00:25:39,502 --> 00:25:40,968
I do that.

413
00:25:41,003 --> 00:25:42,501
Well, that sounds like
a matter for your therapist.

414
00:25:42,536 --> 00:25:45,667
I'll leave you now
to ponder this
turn of events,

415
00:25:45,702 --> 00:25:48,400
but as instructed,
I will be at your
home at 7 p.m.

416
00:25:48,435 --> 00:25:50,200
to give you
a glimpse of your...

417
00:25:50,235 --> 00:25:51,834
future life.

418
00:25:51,869 --> 00:25:53,734
Hmm. Wrong Dickens book.

419
00:25:53,769 --> 00:25:56,367
Another attempt at humor.

420
00:25:56,402 --> 00:25:59,100
Yes. Jolly good.

421
00:25:59,135 --> 00:26:00,100
All right.

422
00:26:00,135 --> 00:26:02,300
Just hold on there,
four-eyes.

423
00:26:02,335 --> 00:26:05,400
You know, you-- you can't
just waltz in off the street

424
00:26:05,435 --> 00:26:07,868
and throw out some--
some fancy-schmancy words

425
00:26:07,903 --> 00:26:09,400
with that phony
accent of yours

426
00:26:09,435 --> 00:26:11,167
and expect anybody
in their right mind

427
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:13,367
to believe you, Mr...

428
00:26:13,402 --> 00:26:15,033
Brandon.
Brandon.

429
00:26:15,068 --> 00:26:16,133
Yeah, like that's
your real name.

430
00:26:16,168 --> 00:26:17,767
I mean, how stupid
do you think I am?

431
00:26:17,802 --> 00:26:19,667
Fine! Fine, Ms. Malone.

432
00:26:19,702 --> 00:26:21,334
I will go back
to my employer

433
00:26:21,369 --> 00:26:22,767
and tell him that
you simply weren't

434
00:26:22,802 --> 00:26:25,667
interested in his offer
to make you incredibly rich.

435
00:26:25,702 --> 00:26:29,167
Have a nice day.
Yeah, you do that.

436
00:26:29,202 --> 00:26:30,634
Okay, let's not be hasty.

437
00:26:30,669 --> 00:26:33,534
Oh, and...
wear something formal.

438
00:26:33,569 --> 00:26:36,067
Wait!

439
00:26:36,102 --> 00:26:37,934
You know where I live?

440
00:26:37,969 --> 00:26:39,901
<i>I mean, that's just</i>
<i>ridiculous, right?</i>

441
00:26:39,936 --> 00:26:41,534
What is all this nonsense?

442
00:26:41,569 --> 00:26:43,033
I mean, he's just
getting my hopes up

443
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:45,367
in some mysterious
benefactor?

444
00:26:45,402 --> 00:26:47,000
I mean, who in the Sam Hill
does he think he is?

445
00:26:47,035 --> 00:26:48,234
Right, Linus?

446
00:26:48,269 --> 00:26:49,801
Right?
[mews]

447
00:26:53,968 --> 00:26:55,667
But I'm just going
to get ready, you know?

448
00:26:55,702 --> 00:26:57,501
Just get ready.
Just in case--

449
00:26:57,536 --> 00:26:59,901
Just in case it's not
all some big hoax.

450
00:26:59,936 --> 00:27:04,367
Formal. Something formal.
Do I own "formal"?

451
00:27:18,133 --> 00:27:20,434
What do you think,
Linus? Hmm?

452
00:27:21,634 --> 00:27:23,501
[meows]

453
00:27:23,536 --> 00:27:26,267
Oh, you're really
no help at all, are ya?

454
00:27:40,734 --> 00:27:43,434
You've got
to be joking.

455
00:27:43,469 --> 00:27:46,033
[groans, sighs]

456
00:27:47,434 --> 00:27:51,367
Well, of course they
don't have a lift. No.

457
00:27:51,402 --> 00:27:53,801
[sighs]
I'll just take the stairs.

458
00:27:57,901 --> 00:27:59,934
[gasps]

459
00:28:02,534 --> 00:28:04,400
[groans]

460
00:28:06,534 --> 00:28:09,100
I've never seen
so many steps

461
00:28:09,135 --> 00:28:11,667
in my life.

462
00:28:16,434 --> 00:28:18,934
She couldn't live
in a bungalow.

463
00:28:18,969 --> 00:28:21,167
[sighs]

464
00:28:33,501 --> 00:28:35,400
Wow, you actually
showed up.

465
00:28:35,435 --> 00:28:37,000
[breathing heavily]

466
00:28:37,035 --> 00:28:40,133
Is this okay?

467
00:28:40,168 --> 00:28:42,801
You look--
You look lovely.

468
00:28:42,836 --> 00:28:45,367
Lovely is good.
I'll take lovely.

469
00:28:46,968 --> 00:28:51,334
The-- The dress is very, uh--

470
00:28:51,369 --> 00:28:53,601
Bridesmaid chic?

471
00:28:53,636 --> 00:28:56,334
Yeah, I know.
I'm a trend-setter.
It's what I do.

472
00:28:56,369 --> 00:28:58,267
[laughs]

473
00:28:59,601 --> 00:29:01,467
[sighs]

474
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,801
Huh.

475
00:29:07,836 --> 00:29:10,934
Not exactly the kind of car
I expected you to drive.

476
00:29:10,969 --> 00:29:13,267
It's kinda like
the, uh, Batmobile.

477
00:29:13,302 --> 00:29:17,267
Not that you don't bear
a striking resemblance
to Bruce Wayne.

478
00:29:17,302 --> 00:29:20,000
Sorry, I have no idea
who this Wayne character
is, but uh--

479
00:29:20,035 --> 00:29:22,334
The car doesn't suit me
because it's not mine.

480
00:29:22,369 --> 00:29:24,334
It's yours.
[sighs]

481
00:29:26,868 --> 00:29:29,200
Oh!
[whimpering]

482
00:29:29,235 --> 00:29:32,501
Uh-huh.
Brandon, George.
George, Brandon.

483
00:29:32,536 --> 00:29:33,767
Oh.
Hi!

484
00:29:33,802 --> 00:29:35,334
Hello.
How are ya?

485
00:29:35,369 --> 00:29:37,667
Nice to meet you.
[chuckling]
You hurt her, I'll kill ya.

486
00:29:39,067 --> 00:29:43,234
I'm quite sure you would.
[laughing]

487
00:29:46,167 --> 00:29:48,133
Bye!
Bye-bye, sweetheart.

488
00:29:48,168 --> 00:29:49,901
[starting engine]

489
00:29:49,936 --> 00:29:52,100
You kids have
a good time.
Yeah.

490
00:30:01,234 --> 00:30:03,734
## [classical piano]

491
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,267
Do you think we could
go somewhere else?

492
00:30:17,302 --> 00:30:19,234
Get a burger
or something?

493
00:30:19,269 --> 00:30:22,901
Though the possibility
of mad cow disease
is appealing,

494
00:30:22,936 --> 00:30:25,267
the answer is no;
these were my instructions.

495
00:30:27,334 --> 00:30:30,000
Okay, just for the record,
I don't exactly fit in here.

496
00:30:30,035 --> 00:30:33,501
Don't be ridiculous.
The only thing that
fits in here is money.

497
00:30:33,536 --> 00:30:35,934
And now you have it!

498
00:30:38,767 --> 00:30:42,501
Good evening.
Hi.

499
00:30:42,536 --> 00:30:46,567
Um, your best table
for the special young lady.

500
00:30:48,133 --> 00:30:51,934
Ah, yes. She's
obviously quite special.

501
00:30:53,033 --> 00:30:55,067
Right this way.

502
00:31:12,434 --> 00:31:13,801
[flaps]
[screams, laughs]

503
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:20,667
Sorry.

504
00:31:22,434 --> 00:31:24,334
Hmm.

505
00:31:26,033 --> 00:31:28,033
I'll send over
the sommelier, sir.

506
00:31:28,068 --> 00:31:30,200
Excellent.

507
00:31:31,334 --> 00:31:34,000
Is that the French
word for menu?

508
00:31:34,035 --> 00:31:36,767
Uh, no, it's
the wine steward.

509
00:31:36,802 --> 00:31:38,467
Right.
[chuckles]

510
00:31:38,502 --> 00:31:41,901
Those "sawmilliaires"
sure come in handy.

511
00:31:44,534 --> 00:31:48,400
<i>Bonsoir, monsieur</i>
<i>et madame.</i>

512
00:31:48,435 --> 00:31:50,767
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

513
00:31:50,802 --> 00:31:53,133
Hi.

514
00:31:54,367 --> 00:31:57,267
Oh. I won't be
needing these.

515
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:01,400
Just thought I'd save
the dishwasher some work.

516
00:32:05,267 --> 00:32:09,067
[normal American accent]
I'll be back to tell you
the specials.

517
00:32:13,534 --> 00:32:15,601
What?

518
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:19,567
Well, you're, um--
[clearing throat]

519
00:32:19,602 --> 00:32:22,734
You're quite odd.
Yeah?

520
00:32:22,769 --> 00:32:27,968
Look who's talking,
Mr. Stiff Stiffy
Stiff Guy.

521
00:32:28,003 --> 00:32:30,267
Are you quite finished?
Yeah, pretty much.

522
00:32:30,302 --> 00:32:32,767
Look, just for the record,

523
00:32:32,802 --> 00:32:36,133
I'm not exactly thrilled
with being your attendant.

524
00:32:36,168 --> 00:32:38,200
It's not in my
job description,

525
00:32:38,235 --> 00:32:40,133
so why don't we just
try and get through this
as quickly

526
00:32:40,168 --> 00:32:42,133
and cordially as possible?

527
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:44,601
Cordially?

528
00:32:46,968 --> 00:32:49,868
Sorry, I couldn't
help myself.

529
00:32:49,903 --> 00:32:52,567
Do you think
I could at least know
a little something

530
00:32:52,602 --> 00:32:54,567
about this
mysterious benefactor?

531
00:32:54,602 --> 00:32:56,934
I mean, seriously,
the curiosity's kinda
killing me here.

532
00:32:56,969 --> 00:32:59,434
No.
Come on!

533
00:32:59,469 --> 00:33:02,567
Just a little hint?
A small, little,
miniscule--

534
00:33:02,602 --> 00:33:05,567
I realize that you can't
relate, Miss Malone,

535
00:33:05,602 --> 00:33:07,801
but I follow the rules.

536
00:33:12,901 --> 00:33:16,133
"The rules," do you?
[laughs]

537
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:24,534
I'm sure you follow
"the rules," to a "T",
don't you, Brandon?

538
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:27,767
Pip-pip. Cheerio.
Jully good.

539
00:33:28,934 --> 00:33:34,400
Excuse me, but I take
my job very seriously.

540
00:33:34,435 --> 00:33:36,667
Besides, I would be dismissed
immediately if I said

541
00:33:36,702 --> 00:33:38,434
the slightest thing
to you about my employer.

542
00:33:38,469 --> 00:33:41,133
So, yes.
I follow the rules.

543
00:33:41,168 --> 00:33:43,734
Rules, schmules.
Ah, biting wit.

544
00:33:45,434 --> 00:33:48,701
Hmm.

545
00:33:48,736 --> 00:33:51,000
That waiter
wasn't really French.

546
00:33:54,234 --> 00:33:56,801
[engine revving]
[brakes screeching]

547
00:34:06,968 --> 00:34:09,400
[turns off ignition]
Sorry.

548
00:34:09,435 --> 00:34:11,467
I probably should have
warned you

549
00:34:11,502 --> 00:34:14,234
that I've never actually
driven a real car.

550
00:34:14,269 --> 00:34:17,667
Only the simulated kind
in Driver's Ed.

551
00:34:17,702 --> 00:34:18,667
Oh, really.
I would never have guessed.

552
00:34:18,702 --> 00:34:21,033
[chuckles]
Ow!

553
00:34:22,934 --> 00:34:25,767
Um, I just--

554
00:34:25,802 --> 00:34:27,667
I just wanted
to say thanks.

555
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:32,267
I just-- I had the--
[sighs]

556
00:34:32,302 --> 00:34:34,133
I had the time
of my life.

557
00:34:35,234 --> 00:34:39,734
And I owe it
all to you.

558
00:34:39,769 --> 00:34:41,868
Well, thanks.

559
00:34:41,903 --> 00:34:43,601
[laughs]

560
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,334
Get it?
Uh--

561
00:34:48,369 --> 00:34:51,367
Oh, my God. Don't
tell me you've never
seen <i>Dirty Dancing</i>.

562
00:34:51,402 --> 00:34:55,267
I--
Okay. How about
<i>The Breakfast Club?</i>

563
00:34:56,567 --> 00:34:59,634
Come on.
You have to have seen

564
00:34:59,669 --> 00:35:03,167
<i>Footloose</i>, right?
Afraid not.

565
00:35:03,202 --> 00:35:06,400
"There is a time to laugh,
and a time to cry,

566
00:35:06,435 --> 00:35:09,000
and oh, yes, there is
a time to dance."

567
00:35:09,035 --> 00:35:11,434
Well, that sounds
quite inspirational.

568
00:35:11,469 --> 00:35:13,934
Oh, you mock, because
you've never witnessed
the power of Kevin Bacon

569
00:35:13,969 --> 00:35:16,234
in a pair of Levi's.
[chuckles]

570
00:35:17,734 --> 00:35:20,968
Kevin <i>Bacon</i>?
Mm-hmm.

571
00:35:21,003 --> 00:35:24,534
Come on. That's not
his real name.

572
00:35:24,569 --> 00:35:28,133
No! Really?

573
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:30,801
Well, what's his
middle name? "Eggs 'n'?"

574
00:35:32,934 --> 00:35:34,934
Eggs 'n' bacon.
Mm-hmm.

575
00:35:43,167 --> 00:35:45,434
Wait a minute.
[coughs]
Pardon that outburst.

576
00:35:45,469 --> 00:35:49,100
Mm-hmm.
There you go.

577
00:35:49,135 --> 00:35:52,067
Wait, no. I told you.
This is your car.

578
00:35:52,102 --> 00:35:54,133
What are you, insane?
I can't drive this thing.

579
00:35:54,168 --> 00:35:57,567
I'm not gonna argue that.
Good. Pick me up
at 9:20.

580
00:35:57,602 --> 00:36:00,000
Oh, well, actually,
I really can't. More, I--

581
00:36:00,035 --> 00:36:03,968
Oh, and be on time.
I never like to be late.

582
00:36:04,003 --> 00:36:05,734
Right.
Fine, splendid.

583
00:36:05,769 --> 00:36:10,200
Uh, see you
tomorrow, then.

584
00:36:10,235 --> 00:36:13,701
Typical nutty American.
Always wanting everything
for themselves.

585
00:36:13,736 --> 00:36:15,701
It doesn't matter
that I've got a busy day.

586
00:36:15,736 --> 00:36:19,067
[muttering]

587
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,334
[starts engine]

588
00:36:23,369 --> 00:36:25,267
[continues chattering]

589
00:36:35,834 --> 00:36:36,834
[Man]
How did it go?

590
00:36:36,869 --> 00:36:40,367
Did she enjoy herself?

591
00:36:40,402 --> 00:36:44,734
Oh, yes, well,
she seemed to, sir.

592
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:48,501
I must say, she's rather
a different sort.

593
00:36:48,536 --> 00:36:50,601
Very unimpressed
by monetary things.

594
00:36:50,636 --> 00:36:54,634
[laughs]
She's unimpressed
by $150,000 vehicles?

595
00:36:54,669 --> 00:36:56,667
Well, yes, sir.

596
00:36:56,702 --> 00:37:01,334
And I must add, she
befriends street people.

597
00:37:01,369 --> 00:37:02,834
Street people?

598
00:37:02,869 --> 00:37:05,567
Yes, sir.
Big, black ones.

599
00:37:08,767 --> 00:37:12,100
I'm terribly sorry, sir,
but this really is
quite irregular.

600
00:37:12,135 --> 00:37:14,400
My other duties for you
are far more important--

601
00:37:14,435 --> 00:37:16,767
More important than what?
My priorities?

602
00:37:19,367 --> 00:37:21,901
Or yours?

603
00:37:21,936 --> 00:37:24,834
Sir, she's rude.
She's ill-mannered.

604
00:37:24,869 --> 00:37:26,601
Enough!

605
00:37:28,167 --> 00:37:30,100
You have your instructions.

606
00:37:34,667 --> 00:37:36,834
Yes, sir.

607
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,467
[door opens, closes]

608
00:37:53,601 --> 00:37:57,267
## [classical orchestra]

609
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:05,567
Mornin', George.
Oh, you're early.

610
00:38:05,602 --> 00:38:08,801
Well, she's all ready
for you, huh?

611
00:38:08,836 --> 00:38:12,634
No. Gettin' a ride today.
Ah.

612
00:38:14,601 --> 00:38:17,434
Later, gator.
While, crocodile.

613
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,133
Him. I should have known.

614
00:38:25,968 --> 00:38:29,868
Hanging with the homeless?
Don't be mean.
George is my friend.

615
00:38:29,903 --> 00:38:32,434
Quite right.
Terribly sorry.

616
00:38:36,968 --> 00:38:40,000
[sighs, clears throat]
Okay. Come on.
Let's go.

617
00:38:40,035 --> 00:38:41,734
I don't like to be late.
I don't like to be late.

618
00:38:41,769 --> 00:38:44,367
Yes, I know.

619
00:38:44,402 --> 00:38:47,400
You do realize you can quit
this bookstore nonsense now?

620
00:38:47,435 --> 00:38:49,767
Don't be ridiculous.
Lettie needs me.

621
00:38:49,802 --> 00:38:51,467
Fair enough.

622
00:38:51,502 --> 00:38:53,334
But you must leave
early today.

623
00:38:53,369 --> 00:38:55,634
[British accent]
Why must I, sir?

624
00:38:55,669 --> 00:39:00,133
Please, tell me why?
[laughs]

625
00:39:00,168 --> 00:39:02,767
That is uncanny.

626
00:39:02,802 --> 00:39:05,701
Your accent's remarkable.
You could be
from my home town.

627
00:39:05,736 --> 00:39:07,467
Really?
No.

628
00:39:07,502 --> 00:39:09,400
[starts engine]

629
00:39:22,868 --> 00:39:25,067
Thanks for the ride.

630
00:39:29,801 --> 00:39:32,667
Ooh-whee,
what have we here?

631
00:39:32,702 --> 00:39:35,400
A man
dropping you off?

632
00:39:35,435 --> 00:39:38,934
A rich man, at that.
Not how it looks.

633
00:39:38,969 --> 00:39:41,467
It looks pretty
good to me.
Well, it is pretty good.

634
00:39:41,502 --> 00:39:43,434
But not in the way
you're thinking,
gutter mind.

635
00:39:43,469 --> 00:39:47,067
He works for
my benefactor.
Your what-afactor?

636
00:39:48,767 --> 00:39:51,033
Okay, brace yourself.
Do you remember the wishes?

637
00:39:51,068 --> 00:39:54,901
Yeah, well, it turns out
that I have, for all
intents and purposes,

638
00:39:54,936 --> 00:39:57,133
a fairy godmother,
or fairy godfather,

639
00:39:57,168 --> 00:40:00,000
who wants to make
all my wishes come true.

640
00:40:00,035 --> 00:40:02,901
Wow, that
sounds even weirder
saying it out loud.

641
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,868
All those Hail Marys
paid off.

642
00:40:06,903 --> 00:40:08,834
I never thought
that'd work.

643
00:40:08,869 --> 00:40:10,968
But that young man
is not your young man.

644
00:40:11,003 --> 00:40:13,367
No, he's just
doing his job.

645
00:40:13,402 --> 00:40:16,834
But wow. You barely
missed a beat.

646
00:40:16,869 --> 00:40:19,167
This kinda stuff happen
every day in your world?

647
00:40:19,202 --> 00:40:21,334
I believe
in miracles, honey.

648
00:40:22,968 --> 00:40:25,567
Lettie, do you believe
that wishes can come true?

649
00:40:25,602 --> 00:40:28,868
Well, I believe in miracles,
so sure I believe
wishes can come true.

650
00:40:28,903 --> 00:40:31,667
I've always believed.

651
00:40:31,702 --> 00:40:33,767
I think I'm starting
to believe, too.

652
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,868
I wish-- I wish--

653
00:40:41,903 --> 00:40:43,901
I wish for
the afternoon off.

654
00:40:46,033 --> 00:40:48,634
Oh, sh--

655
00:40:48,669 --> 00:40:51,267
[laughing]

656
00:40:51,302 --> 00:40:54,801
## <i>[country]</i>

657
00:41:02,701 --> 00:41:05,601
Good afternoon.
We would like some help

658
00:41:05,636 --> 00:41:07,901
with this
young lady's attire.

659
00:41:07,936 --> 00:41:10,934
She has a very important
appointment this afternoon,
for which she must look--

660
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:14,567
Reasonably presentable?

661
00:41:14,602 --> 00:41:17,934
Actually, I was going
to say, more beautiful
than she already does.

662
00:41:21,767 --> 00:41:24,667
Why, of course.
I'll start pulling
some things in her size.

663
00:41:24,702 --> 00:41:27,601
Good.
What are you?
About a size 26?

664
00:41:27,636 --> 00:41:30,200
Actually, about a four.

665
00:41:30,235 --> 00:41:33,467
European sizes, darling.

666
00:41:33,502 --> 00:41:34,968
Right.
[chuckles]

667
00:41:35,003 --> 00:41:37,334
That metric system
gets me every time.

668
00:41:40,367 --> 00:41:43,300
Can we please leave?
Leave? Why?

669
00:41:43,335 --> 00:41:45,434
I thought girls
loved shopping.

670
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:48,834
They don't like me, Brandon.
They're staring at me.

671
00:41:48,869 --> 00:41:52,601
[sighs]
Well, that's because
you're stunning.

672
00:41:52,636 --> 00:41:54,534
Thanks.

673
00:41:54,569 --> 00:41:57,934
You're a liar,
but thanks.

674
00:41:57,969 --> 00:42:00,767
[sighs]
Okay. Here we are.

675
00:42:00,802 --> 00:42:02,701
Thank you.

676
00:42:05,334 --> 00:42:09,567
Oh, wait.
Isn't this where I do that
"clothes-trying-on" montage

677
00:42:09,602 --> 00:42:12,033
and that Roy Orbison song
plays in the background?

678
00:42:12,068 --> 00:42:15,033
Get it?

679
00:42:18,534 --> 00:42:21,567
Oh, just forget it.
## <i>[country]</i>

680
00:42:32,834 --> 00:42:36,033
Thanks for
lettin' me get the hat.
Lettie's gonna love it.

681
00:42:36,068 --> 00:42:39,100
Well, it's your money.
Right.

682
00:42:39,135 --> 00:42:41,100
So, what next?

683
00:42:41,135 --> 00:42:43,033
Right this way, madam.

684
00:42:45,133 --> 00:42:48,300
This madam's pantyhose
are riding up.
Charming.

685
00:43:02,868 --> 00:43:07,000
[dings]

686
00:43:12,567 --> 00:43:16,167
Good afternoon.
May I help you
and the lovely lady?

687
00:43:16,202 --> 00:43:19,601
Yes, we would like
to open an account
for a Miss Maggie Malone.

688
00:43:19,636 --> 00:43:23,067
[softly]
That's me.
Maggie. That's lovely name.

689
00:43:23,102 --> 00:43:25,000
Oh, thanks.
My friends call me Mags.

690
00:43:25,035 --> 00:43:26,267
Good to meet ya.

691
00:43:26,302 --> 00:43:27,901
Firm handshake.

692
00:43:27,936 --> 00:43:31,834
Now just exactly
what kind of an account
would you like to open today?

693
00:43:31,869 --> 00:43:34,234
A very large one.

694
00:43:34,269 --> 00:43:37,100
Ah, my favorite.
[chuckles]
Please.

695
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,234
Can I have one of these?
Help yourself.

696
00:43:55,167 --> 00:43:59,467
Now. Just exactly
how large an account
would you like to open?

697
00:43:59,502 --> 00:44:02,267
Five million dollars.
[spits out pen]

698
00:44:14,868 --> 00:44:17,667
Bye, Felix.

699
00:44:17,702 --> 00:44:20,267
So, I'm a five
"millionairess," huh?
Ooh.

700
00:44:20,302 --> 00:44:21,868
Pretty cool.

701
00:44:21,903 --> 00:44:24,234
It was so nice of him
to let me have
all these pens.

702
00:44:26,367 --> 00:44:29,467
Wow, these little purses
are just useless.

703
00:44:29,502 --> 00:44:31,467
You're genuinely
more excited

704
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:34,501
about the pens
than the money, aren't you?

705
00:44:34,536 --> 00:44:37,200
Guess I'm just a simple girl
with simple tastes.

706
00:44:37,235 --> 00:44:40,267
Well, whoever told you
you were simple lied.

707
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:42,234
Lettie says
that I'm special.

708
00:44:42,269 --> 00:44:45,200
And not like "I ride on
the short bus" special.

709
00:44:45,235 --> 00:44:49,033
"The short bus."
I presume that's
another American thing.

710
00:44:49,068 --> 00:44:51,100
Yes, it is.
Stick with me, kid.

711
00:44:51,135 --> 00:44:53,734
I'll teach you all
you need to know about
smart-ass Americans.

712
00:44:53,769 --> 00:44:55,667
Truly, you are too kind.

713
00:45:02,667 --> 00:45:05,467
Out of order again.
Shocker!

714
00:45:09,133 --> 00:45:12,200
## ['80s Rock]

715
00:45:13,968 --> 00:45:16,567
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>Hey. Wait. Look.</i>
<i>I'm Debbie Gibson.</i>

716
00:45:16,602 --> 00:45:18,801
[laughing]
[Woman #2]
Debbie, meet Culture Club.

717
00:45:18,836 --> 00:45:23,000
Oh, I love them.
The ruby slippers.
"There's no place like home."

718
00:45:23,035 --> 00:45:26,701
[Woman #3]
It's frightening. Look at this
with the price tag still on it.

719
00:45:26,736 --> 00:45:28,834
What is she thinking?
Not now. Girls,
she needs our help.

720
00:45:28,869 --> 00:45:33,501
It's wrong.
Uh, hello? Oh,
who's calling? Maggie!

721
00:45:33,536 --> 00:45:34,634
The '80s are on the phone.

722
00:45:34,669 --> 00:45:37,200
They want their
entire collection back.

723
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:40,868
Ha, ha, ha.
Very funny.

724
00:45:40,903 --> 00:45:44,367
Wow, Mags.
You look great.

725
00:45:44,402 --> 00:45:46,000
Love your shoes,
and the hat!

726
00:45:46,035 --> 00:45:48,934
You could really use
an amber scarf to offset
the whole thing,

727
00:45:48,969 --> 00:45:52,167
but--
Yeah. Could you take a moment
from doing running commentary

728
00:45:52,202 --> 00:45:55,033
on my wardrobe to tell me
what in the Sam Hill
is goin' on here?

729
00:45:55,068 --> 00:45:56,901
We're going through
your clothes.

730
00:45:56,936 --> 00:45:58,400
Yeah, I see that.
Why?

731
00:45:58,435 --> 00:46:00,868
This is
an intervention.

732
00:46:00,903 --> 00:46:02,934
A what?

733
00:46:02,969 --> 00:46:05,567
What exactly are
you all saving me from?

734
00:46:05,602 --> 00:46:07,634
Spinsterhood.

735
00:46:07,669 --> 00:46:11,067
Ugh, again with
that archaic word.

736
00:46:12,767 --> 00:46:15,434
What prompted you all
on this particular night

737
00:46:15,469 --> 00:46:19,634
to leave your happily-married
husbands at home,

738
00:46:19,669 --> 00:46:23,067
where you should be doing,
you know, happily-married
things together,

739
00:46:23,102 --> 00:46:27,100
to come and
save your pathetic,
poorly-dressed friend.

740
00:46:27,135 --> 00:46:29,434
Lettie called, and we don't
think you're pathetic.

741
00:46:29,469 --> 00:46:30,934
Maybe a little.

742
00:46:30,969 --> 00:46:33,567
And what, pray tell,
did Lettie have to say?

743
00:46:33,602 --> 00:46:35,734
That some hottie rich guy
is interested in you,

744
00:46:35,769 --> 00:46:37,267
and you're dissing him.

745
00:46:37,302 --> 00:46:40,601
"Dissing him"?
What are you,
a rap star now?

746
00:46:40,636 --> 00:46:43,501
Okay, whatever.
Blowing him off.
Kicking him to the curb.

747
00:46:43,536 --> 00:46:45,801
Okay, did she include
the part about the fact that

748
00:46:45,836 --> 00:46:49,067
he's not even remotely
interested, and that
it's just business?

749
00:46:49,102 --> 00:46:51,367
Come on, Mags.
Tell us the gory details.

750
00:46:51,402 --> 00:46:53,734
Uh, no.

751
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:57,701
Okay, secretive.
Can we at least discuss your
excessive overall collection?

752
00:46:57,736 --> 00:46:59,567
Uh, please.
Door number two.

753
00:47:03,801 --> 00:47:05,968
And, behind door number one,

754
00:47:06,003 --> 00:47:08,534
all the shoes have
rubber soles, or--

755
00:47:08,569 --> 00:47:11,067
have been dyed
to match taffeta.

756
00:47:11,102 --> 00:47:13,968
You "smarty-pantses" will
be happy to know that
I went shopping today.

757
00:47:14,003 --> 00:47:15,634
Is "pantses" a word?

758
00:47:15,669 --> 00:47:18,000
Who cares?
What's in the bag?

759
00:47:18,035 --> 00:47:19,934
# You blow my mind
Hey, Mickey #

760
00:47:19,969 --> 00:47:22,067
# Hey, Mickey #

761
00:47:22,102 --> 00:47:23,667
# So, Mickey, you're so fine #

762
00:47:23,702 --> 00:47:26,501
# You're so fine
you blow my mind, hey Mickey #

763
00:47:26,536 --> 00:47:28,467
# Hey, Mickey #

764
00:47:30,501 --> 00:47:33,868
Mags? Maggie?

765
00:47:33,903 --> 00:47:35,968
Maggie Malone?

766
00:47:36,003 --> 00:47:37,901
Shh!
Not so loud.

767
00:47:37,936 --> 00:47:41,367
Feels like there's
a thousand games of marbles

768
00:47:41,402 --> 00:47:43,300
going on in my head.
Who's winning?

769
00:47:43,335 --> 00:47:45,367
Who cares?
[chuckles]
Come here. Come here.

770
00:47:45,402 --> 00:47:46,801
Come here. Come here.
What?

771
00:47:46,836 --> 00:47:48,868
What are you-- What--
Oh, oh, oh.

772
00:47:48,903 --> 00:47:51,033
What are you doing?
I'm dolling you up.

773
00:47:51,068 --> 00:47:54,567
Why?
Because that young man
is gonna be picking you up

774
00:47:54,602 --> 00:47:57,133
in about... one minute.

775
00:47:57,168 --> 00:48:00,100
Lettie, are you conspiring
behind my back again?

776
00:48:00,135 --> 00:48:03,767
I told you.
No dates, no men.

777
00:48:03,802 --> 00:48:06,968
Besides, what makes
you think he's even
interested in me?

778
00:48:07,003 --> 00:48:09,467
Or better yet, what makes you
think I'm interested in him?

779
00:48:09,502 --> 00:48:12,133
I mean, he's
not even my type.

780
00:48:12,168 --> 00:48:14,667
<i>So, what is your type?</i>

781
00:48:17,234 --> 00:48:19,133
Hi!

782
00:48:19,168 --> 00:48:20,601
Hi.

783
00:48:21,901 --> 00:48:23,534
This is awkward.

784
00:48:23,569 --> 00:48:25,434
[clears throat]
You.

785
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,334
Um, no, um, you are--

786
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,534
Okay, I don't know
this game.

787
00:48:36,569 --> 00:48:37,968
Lettie, would you
help us out?

788
00:48:38,003 --> 00:48:39,567
She seems
to have a little--

789
00:48:39,602 --> 00:48:41,367
Come here, sweetie. Okay.
Here you go, sweetie.

790
00:48:41,402 --> 00:48:44,200
Here-- Here--
[sighs]

791
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,234
I just had a little--

792
00:48:49,269 --> 00:48:50,934
Yeah.

793
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:53,968
Well, as much as
I'd like to draw
this magic moment out,

794
00:48:54,003 --> 00:48:56,234
we really should
be going, so--

795
00:48:56,269 --> 00:48:58,400
Chop-chop.
What chop-chop?

796
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:00,534
Where are we going?
You'll see.

797
00:49:00,569 --> 00:49:03,100
I'm in the middle of work,
I can't just leave.

798
00:49:03,135 --> 00:49:05,400
Have a lovely day, Lettie.
Bye-bye.
[Lettie chuckles]

799
00:49:05,435 --> 00:49:07,901
Bye now.

800
00:49:07,936 --> 00:49:09,834
Yes!

801
00:49:17,601 --> 00:49:19,701
I can't keep taking
days off, you know.

802
00:49:19,736 --> 00:49:21,801
I have a job.
Oh, pish-posh.

803
00:49:21,836 --> 00:49:23,734
You're rich, remember?

804
00:49:29,067 --> 00:49:30,334
So what is your type?

805
00:49:30,369 --> 00:49:31,400
Excuse me?

806
00:49:31,435 --> 00:49:33,067
Well, you said
I wasn't your type,

807
00:49:33,102 --> 00:49:34,868
so I presume you have one.

808
00:49:34,903 --> 00:49:37,000
A type, that is.
Mm. Yeah.

809
00:49:37,035 --> 00:49:39,467
Not really.
I don't date.

810
00:49:39,502 --> 00:49:42,100
Really? Why is that?

811
00:49:42,135 --> 00:49:45,067
I don't believe in love.
Bloody hell.

812
00:49:45,102 --> 00:49:49,300
That's a bit grim.
No, just--

813
00:49:49,335 --> 00:49:53,300
I mean, the whole concept
just seems archaic,
doesn't it?

814
00:49:53,335 --> 00:49:55,968
Two people spending
the rest of their
lives together?

815
00:49:56,003 --> 00:49:58,601
What was this, a concept
that came into fashion

816
00:49:58,636 --> 00:50:02,300
back when 15 was
considered middle-aged?

817
00:50:02,335 --> 00:50:04,267
And how about all
those silly rituals?

818
00:50:04,302 --> 00:50:07,434
Something old,
something new,
blah, blah, blah--

819
00:50:07,469 --> 00:50:10,868
Oh, oh. The best one?
My favorite? The throwing
of the bouquet.

820
00:50:10,903 --> 00:50:13,200
I mean, seriously.
What is the sense
in buying

821
00:50:13,235 --> 00:50:15,200
a whole bunch
of stupid flowers,

822
00:50:15,235 --> 00:50:17,434
just to have
to lug 'em around
the whole damn time--

823
00:50:17,469 --> 00:50:20,133
And then to throw
'em mindlessly to
a bunch of losers,

824
00:50:20,168 --> 00:50:23,367
who would fight each
other to the death to be
"the one" to catch it?

825
00:50:23,402 --> 00:50:25,234
I mean, really.

826
00:50:27,067 --> 00:50:29,167
So not a big fan
of marriage, then?

827
00:50:29,202 --> 00:50:32,300
[chuckles]
What about children?

828
00:50:32,335 --> 00:50:34,467
I'm sure your parents
would someday like to hear

829
00:50:34,502 --> 00:50:36,601
the pitter-patter
of tiny feet?

830
00:50:39,133 --> 00:50:41,067
I don't have parents.

831
00:50:44,434 --> 00:50:48,100
Right. Oh.

832
00:50:48,135 --> 00:50:50,734
I guess now
it's my turn to
feel awkward.

833
00:50:53,334 --> 00:50:56,734
Don't worry. I'm not
gonna start sobbing
or anything.

834
00:50:59,467 --> 00:51:04,167
My mom died
when I was four,
and my dad gave me up.

835
00:51:06,067 --> 00:51:10,234
Only thing I remember
about him was that
he had this mustache,

836
00:51:10,269 --> 00:51:14,701
and he used to do these
really bad magic tricks.

837
00:51:14,736 --> 00:51:17,200
On Sundays, the nuns would
take us into town

838
00:51:17,235 --> 00:51:19,934
and I would go up to
every guy with facial hair

839
00:51:19,969 --> 00:51:23,067
and ask him
if he was my dad.
[chuckles]

840
00:51:23,102 --> 00:51:25,667
How pathetic is that, right?

841
00:51:25,702 --> 00:51:30,067
I'm sure I made
a lot of guys really nervous.

842
00:51:30,102 --> 00:51:32,234
Anyway, he's probably
shaved it off by now,

843
00:51:32,269 --> 00:51:34,868
and I don't really
like to talk about it.

844
00:51:34,903 --> 00:51:36,767
Please don't look
at me that way.

845
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:39,234
What way?

846
00:51:39,269 --> 00:51:41,734
Like you're pitying me.

847
00:51:41,769 --> 00:51:45,968
I'm not. I was--

848
00:51:46,003 --> 00:51:48,434
I was just wondering
why you told me that.

849
00:51:49,501 --> 00:51:51,067
I don't know.

850
00:51:54,467 --> 00:51:58,567
It must be the, uh--
the hangover.

851
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,400
Fair enough.

852
00:52:04,435 --> 00:52:07,667
Well, I'm dreadfully sorry,
but I'm afraid

853
00:52:07,702 --> 00:52:10,534
I'm going to have to
blindfold you now.

854
00:52:10,569 --> 00:52:14,501
What? What kinda
segue is that?

855
00:52:14,536 --> 00:52:17,100
All right. Bring it on.

856
00:52:17,135 --> 00:52:19,868
But just for
the record, I'm not
really into kink, okay?

857
00:52:19,903 --> 00:52:23,434
Yes. Course, I don't
believe you for a second,

858
00:52:23,469 --> 00:52:25,534
you randy old goat.

859
00:52:25,569 --> 00:52:28,167
Right. We're good.

860
00:52:28,202 --> 00:52:29,834
Let us go.
Great.

861
00:52:29,869 --> 00:52:33,067
Yes. Good?
Can you see?
Sure. No. Not at all.

862
00:52:33,102 --> 00:52:37,367
[chuckles]
Oh! I never should
have agreed to this.

863
00:52:37,402 --> 00:52:39,734
All right. But
we're almost there now.

864
00:52:39,769 --> 00:52:41,868
Better be. I'm feeling
the quease factor.

865
00:52:41,903 --> 00:52:45,000
All right, all right.
Bear with me. And--

866
00:52:45,035 --> 00:52:48,200
Stop. Okay.
Are you ready?

867
00:52:51,901 --> 00:52:53,334
Voila!

868
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:11,167
Wow.
[claps hands]

869
00:53:12,501 --> 00:53:14,367
Cool!

870
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:18,601
[laughing]

871
00:53:23,067 --> 00:53:26,267
Oh, this is beautiful!

872
00:53:26,302 --> 00:53:29,367
Though I do find it
mildly disturbing

873
00:53:29,402 --> 00:53:32,200
that you would blindfold
me to bring me up
to your apartment.

874
00:53:32,235 --> 00:53:34,100
Little weird.
[chuckles]

875
00:53:34,135 --> 00:53:36,567
Yeah. Yeah, I can
see why that would be
a little unsettling.

876
00:53:36,602 --> 00:53:38,601
It's not actually
my apartment.

877
00:53:38,636 --> 00:53:42,067
It is, in fact,
your penthouse.

878
00:53:42,102 --> 00:53:46,834
Here at the Renaissance
Park 55, with a maid
and room service--

879
00:53:46,869 --> 00:53:50,434
24/7-- I believe that's
how you Yanks say it.

880
00:53:51,534 --> 00:53:54,801
Shut up.

881
00:53:54,836 --> 00:53:55,801
I can't live here.

882
00:53:55,836 --> 00:53:57,467
What would I do
with all my stuff?

883
00:53:57,502 --> 00:54:00,334
You can't mean all that
old rubbish in your flat.

884
00:54:00,369 --> 00:54:03,767
I-I did bring your cat--
Linus, I believe
he's called--

885
00:54:03,802 --> 00:54:08,267
He should be around here
somewhere. And of course,
all of your papers

886
00:54:08,302 --> 00:54:10,434
that were in
all of those boxes.

887
00:54:10,469 --> 00:54:14,033
We're such
a privacy invader.
Oh, thank you.

888
00:54:14,068 --> 00:54:15,968
Uh.

889
00:54:17,901 --> 00:54:19,767
[sighs]
I can't live here.

890
00:54:21,801 --> 00:54:24,834
Though it is really nice.

891
00:54:24,869 --> 00:54:27,501
And they actually have
elevators that work.

892
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:31,901
And I guess I wouldn't
have to eat lima beans anymore.

893
00:54:31,936 --> 00:54:35,167
Yes. It would be a terrible
shame to say good-bye
to the lima beans.

894
00:54:35,202 --> 00:54:37,067
Do you think
they'd make me liver?

895
00:54:37,102 --> 00:54:38,901
Foie gras?

896
00:54:38,936 --> 00:54:42,267
For what?
Why are you speaking
French all of a sudden?

897
00:54:42,302 --> 00:54:45,033
Do you think that
they'd make me liver?

898
00:54:45,068 --> 00:54:47,601
I suppose.

899
00:54:47,636 --> 00:54:50,667
Okay, then.
Linus and I will stay.

900
00:54:50,702 --> 00:54:53,501
He's a big fan
of the liver.

901
00:54:53,536 --> 00:54:55,601
Aren't we all?
What?

902
00:54:55,636 --> 00:54:59,334
Nothing. Um,
I'm absolutely famished.

903
00:54:59,369 --> 00:55:02,734
Shall I--
Shall I ring down
for room service?

904
00:55:02,769 --> 00:55:05,267
Get them to bring us up
some afternoon tea?
Tea?

905
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:08,300
If you're hungry, order
a sandwich or something.

906
00:55:08,335 --> 00:55:10,133
Oh, and get me one too.

907
00:55:10,168 --> 00:55:11,934
[ringing]
And some aspirin.

908
00:55:11,969 --> 00:55:13,067
[whispers]
I have a headache.

909
00:55:14,567 --> 00:55:16,300

911
00:55:22,834 --> 00:55:24,667
They're so cute!

912
00:55:24,702 --> 00:55:27,000
I almost feel guilty
eating one.

913
00:55:27,035 --> 00:55:28,100
But I will.

914
00:55:28,135 --> 00:55:30,267
Ohh! Ohhh...
too bad.

915
00:55:33,501 --> 00:55:35,000
Do you think
you could refrain

916
00:55:35,035 --> 00:55:37,000
from fingering
all of the sandwiches?

917
00:55:37,035 --> 00:55:38,467
Why?

918
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:42,167
They are called
finger sandwiches,
aren't they?

919
00:55:42,202 --> 00:55:44,300
[giggles]
I won't
even dignify that

920
00:55:44,335 --> 00:55:45,467
with a retort.

921
00:55:45,502 --> 00:55:46,901
Mmm, "retort."

922
00:55:46,936 --> 00:55:49,234
My, we are
very upper-crusty,
aren't we?

923
00:55:49,269 --> 00:55:51,000
What, are you
related to the Queen?

924
00:55:51,035 --> 00:55:53,000
Don't be ridiculous.

925
00:55:53,035 --> 00:55:55,367
Then, my uncle
is a duke.

926
00:55:55,402 --> 00:55:56,801
Yeah.
Same difference.

927
00:56:05,801 --> 00:56:07,067
All righty, Brandon.

928
00:56:08,801 --> 00:56:10,868
Why don't you tell me
a little somethin'
about yourself?

929
00:56:10,903 --> 00:56:13,334
Seems only fair
since you've,
you know,

930
00:56:13,369 --> 00:56:14,968
taken over my life
and all.

931
00:56:15,003 --> 00:56:15,901
Huh.

932
00:56:17,367 --> 00:56:19,567
Well. Where
do I start? Um...

933
00:56:20,901 --> 00:56:23,434
I went to Oxford.
And I graduated

934
00:56:23,469 --> 00:56:24,968
near the top
of my class.

935
00:56:25,003 --> 00:56:28,033
And, uh, then I worked
at the American Embassy
for a year,

936
00:56:28,068 --> 00:56:31,334
which is where
I met my current
employer.

937
00:56:31,369 --> 00:56:32,767
And then
I was uprooted
and moved

938
00:56:32,802 --> 00:56:35,567
to this delightful spot
two weeks ago.

939
00:56:35,602 --> 00:56:38,167
Hmm. That's nice.

940
00:56:38,202 --> 00:56:40,000
But I didn't really
ask for your résumé.

941
00:56:40,035 --> 00:56:41,501
Come on!

942
00:56:41,536 --> 00:56:44,067
Tell me about yourself.
What do you like to do?

943
00:56:44,102 --> 00:56:46,868
What are your hobbies?
Did you have a pet
growing up?

944
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:48,334
Oh, wait.
Don't tell me.

945
00:56:48,369 --> 00:56:49,667
You had a dog,
didn't you?

946
00:56:49,702 --> 00:56:50,801
Uh, uh, uh!

947
00:56:50,836 --> 00:56:52,167
Saint Bernard.

948
00:56:52,202 --> 00:56:55,000
No. No. Great Dane.

949
00:56:55,035 --> 00:56:56,000
Oh, yeah.

950
00:56:56,035 --> 00:56:57,567
Definitely
a Great Dane.

951
00:56:57,602 --> 00:56:59,434
Actually,
I had a parakeet...

952
00:57:00,501 --> 00:57:01,968
...named Trina.

953
00:57:02,003 --> 00:57:04,767
I named her after a girl
I was madly in love with...

954
00:57:04,802 --> 00:57:07,701
in, uh, in what
you refer to
as the third grade.

955
00:57:07,736 --> 00:57:10,067
Hmm. Third grade.
You started young.
Yes.

956
00:57:10,102 --> 00:57:12,133
Well, we-- we didn't
exactly date.

957
00:57:12,168 --> 00:57:14,234
Though we did
ride the seesaw

958
00:57:14,269 --> 00:57:16,133
every afternoon
for three days.

959
00:57:16,168 --> 00:57:18,868
And then,
on the fourth day,
I came to the park...

960
00:57:18,903 --> 00:57:21,334
and she was on the swings
with Nigel Wallingford.

961
00:57:21,369 --> 00:57:23,033
The tramp.

962
00:57:23,068 --> 00:57:25,701
Never quite recovered
from that betrayal.

963
00:57:25,736 --> 00:57:26,901
How could you, really?

964
00:57:28,634 --> 00:57:29,934
[chuckles] Yeah.

965
00:57:29,969 --> 00:57:31,267
[laughs]

966
00:57:39,334 --> 00:57:40,734
All right, Brandon.

967
00:57:40,769 --> 00:57:43,400
Tomorrow,
it's my turn.

968
00:57:43,435 --> 00:57:44,901
Your turn?

969
00:57:44,936 --> 00:57:46,934
Mm-hmm.
I'm gonna show
your blue blood

970
00:57:46,969 --> 00:57:48,701
how the other half
lives.

971
00:57:48,736 --> 00:57:51,067
Oh. Well, thank you.
That's very sweet,

972
00:57:51,102 --> 00:57:54,033
but, um,
I simply... cannot...

973
00:57:54,068 --> 00:57:55,934
Oh, you so simply can.

No, no, no.

just won't do.

977
00:58:14,269 --> 00:58:15,400
Come on.
What? Pardon?

978
00:58:15,435 --> 00:58:16,968
What won't do?

979
00:58:17,003 --> 00:58:18,300

just embarrassing.

Oh, quit
your bitchin'.

982
00:58:25,467 --> 00:58:27,467
Can you take this?
Thanks.

If you stop complaining,
you might actually have
some fun, you know.

00:58:30,636 --> 00:58:34,601
Fun. Right. Yes.
This... looks
like a... hoot.

on littering.

encouraged here.

an enjoyable day.

1034
01:00:39,035 --> 01:00:41,634
I, uh, I don't think
I've had this much
physical activity

1035
01:00:41,669 --> 01:00:42,734
since Oxford--

1036
01:00:42,769 --> 01:00:44,400
first team cricket,
you know.

1037
01:00:44,435 --> 01:00:46,234
Oh, cricket.
Mm-hmm.

1038
01:00:46,269 --> 01:00:48,534
That's that cheap
imitation of baseball,
isn't it?

1039
01:00:48,569 --> 01:00:50,133
I beg your pardon!

1040
01:00:50,168 --> 01:00:51,534
Cricket came first.

1041
01:00:51,569 --> 01:00:53,200
At any rate,
what is the logic

1042
01:00:53,235 --> 01:00:54,901
with hitting a ball
with a cylinder?

1043
01:00:54,936 --> 01:00:56,834
A flat object makes
a lot more sense.

1044
01:00:56,869 --> 01:00:59,334
Oh. God forbid
something be illogical.

1045
01:00:59,369 --> 01:01:01,601
Mm-hmm-hmm.

1046
01:01:01,636 --> 01:01:02,801
Mm, nuts.

1047
01:01:02,836 --> 01:01:05,167
All right.
Come on, Mr. Logic.

1048
01:01:05,202 --> 01:01:06,834
Let's dance.

1049
01:01:06,869 --> 01:01:09,000
Well, there's--
there's no dance floor.

1050
01:01:14,067 --> 01:01:16,033
There is now.

1051
01:01:16,068 --> 01:01:18,400
All right.

You know, traditionally,
the man does lead.

1060
01:01:51,536 --> 01:01:53,400
Hmm, then stop
slacking off.

1061
01:01:53,435 --> 01:01:55,100
Oh.

Ahem.

1076
01:02:48,868 --> 01:02:51,033
So then the monkey
gets off the bar stool

1077
01:02:51,068 --> 01:02:53,167
and says, "I don't
want a daiquiri.

1078
01:02:53,202 --> 01:02:55,400
I want a mai tai!"

1079
01:02:55,435 --> 01:02:59,801
That is the worst joke
I have ever heard.

1080
01:02:59,836 --> 01:03:02,200
I know. I read it
on a lolly stick.

1081
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:06,734
Wow, look at that.

1082
01:03:11,067 --> 01:03:13,567
It's amazing.

1083
01:03:15,501 --> 01:03:17,133
Yeah.

1084
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:34,834
Uh, shall I walk you up?

1085
01:03:34,869 --> 01:03:36,334
Oh, sure.

1086
01:03:36,369 --> 01:03:39,200
Uh, I just usually
take the elevator,
though.

1087
01:03:39,235 --> 01:03:40,200
Oh.

1088
01:03:40,235 --> 01:03:41,667
'Cause it's
a lot of floors.

1089
01:03:41,702 --> 01:03:43,334
Well, I'll ride you
up there, then.

1090
01:03:43,369 --> 01:03:45,267
No, I mean
I'll ride on you up--

1091
01:03:45,302 --> 01:03:47,267
No! I--

1092
01:03:47,302 --> 01:03:49,534
Uh, I'll escort you
to your door.

1093
01:03:49,569 --> 01:03:50,767
Right. Great.

1094
01:03:56,934 --> 01:03:58,200
Well, here we are.

1095
01:03:58,235 --> 01:04:00,267
Yeah. This is my floor.

1096
01:04:00,302 --> 01:04:01,667
Right.

1097
01:04:01,702 --> 01:04:05,501
Um, thank you for a...

1098
01:04:05,536 --> 01:04:06,968
surprising day.

1099
01:04:07,003 --> 01:04:09,133
Mm. Did you have
the time of your life?

1100
01:04:09,168 --> 01:04:10,434
Oh, yeah.

1101
01:04:12,033 --> 01:04:15,968
Um... Okay, well,
it was really good
seeing you again.

1102
01:04:16,003 --> 01:04:18,000
Right. Uh, yeah.

1103
01:04:19,234 --> 01:04:20,234
Oh.

1104
01:04:20,269 --> 01:04:21,234
Oh.
Oh.

1105
01:04:21,269 --> 01:04:22,367
Ow!

1106
01:04:22,402 --> 01:04:23,567
Oh! Oh, I'm so sorry.

1107
01:04:23,602 --> 01:04:25,467
I'm Sorry. Really.

1108
01:04:25,502 --> 01:04:26,767
That's okay.

1109
01:04:33,834 --> 01:04:34,834
[elevator door dings]

1110
01:04:39,501 --> 01:04:40,501

01:04:40,536 --> 01:04:42,133
Uh--
Oh.

1112
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:45,100
There you go.

1113
01:04:45,135 --> 01:04:46,100
Thanks.

1114
01:04:46,135 --> 01:04:47,868
Right.
Got 'em.

1115
01:04:47,903 --> 01:04:49,534
So I'm gonna go,
then.
Right.

1116
01:04:49,569 --> 01:04:50,701
To my room.

1117
01:04:50,736 --> 01:04:52,667
Yeah, well,
that would be where to go.

1118
01:04:52,702 --> 01:04:54,934
Okay, bye.
All right, bye.

1119
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:11,334
Good night.

[ding]

1121
01:05:35,267 --> 01:05:37,868
Mags,
can you give me a hand?

1122
01:05:37,903 --> 01:05:39,400
Maggie.

1123
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:45,133
I'm thinking
of leaving Charlie.

1124
01:05:45,168 --> 01:05:46,367
Mm-hmm.

1125
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,567
'Cause I've been having
this tawdry affair
with the paper boy.

1126
01:05:51,602 --> 01:05:53,467
I like 'em young.

1127
01:05:53,502 --> 01:05:54,968
That's nice.

1128
01:05:57,367 --> 01:05:59,467
I'm also thinking
of having some lipo,

1129
01:05:59,502 --> 01:06:02,767
a boob job,
maybe even a butt lift.

1130
01:06:02,802 --> 01:06:04,200
What do you think,
Mags?

1131
01:06:04,235 --> 01:06:06,567
Uh...
that sounds good.

1132
01:06:06,602 --> 01:06:10,133
Maggie Malone, you haven't
heard one word I've said.

1133
01:06:10,168 --> 01:06:12,801
Oh. Sorry.

1134
01:06:12,836 --> 01:06:16,033
If I didn't know better,
I'd say you were in love.

1135
01:06:16,068 --> 01:06:17,567
Lookin' all doe-eyed.

1136
01:06:17,602 --> 01:06:19,267
What?

1137
01:06:19,302 --> 01:06:20,868
No.

1138
01:06:20,903 --> 01:06:23,434
Nuh-uh.

1139
01:06:23,469 --> 01:06:27,000
But you know, since you
brought it up, I mean...

1140
01:06:27,035 --> 01:06:30,033
in theory,
what would it... be like

1141
01:06:30,068 --> 01:06:31,567
if I was in love?

1142
01:06:31,602 --> 01:06:34,167
How would I know?

1143
01:06:34,202 --> 01:06:35,367
Well...

1144
01:06:40,467 --> 01:06:41,734
Listen to Mama.

1145
01:06:42,968 --> 01:06:44,400
When I met Charlie,

1146
01:06:44,435 --> 01:06:46,033
I didn't know at first.

1147
01:06:46,068 --> 01:06:48,567
I mean, I-- he was a friend
of my brother's,

1148
01:06:48,602 --> 01:06:51,968
and-- and I thought
he was kind of strange.

1149
01:06:52,003 --> 01:06:54,734
But strange in a good way,
you know?

1150
01:06:56,534 --> 01:06:59,501
Then one night,
when my brother wasn't home,

1151
01:06:59,536 --> 01:07:03,100
he came by,
and brought me some daisies.

1152
01:07:06,234 --> 01:07:09,200
He had on this--
this silly

1153
01:07:09,235 --> 01:07:12,801
second-hand yellow jacket...

1154
01:07:12,836 --> 01:07:15,634
and white
patent leather shoes.

1155
01:07:15,669 --> 01:07:20,667
And in that moment,
I fell for him.

1156
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:26,734
That night,
I-- I couldn't sleep.

1157
01:07:26,769 --> 01:07:30,701
I kept thinking what it would
feel like to kiss him.

1158
01:07:30,736 --> 01:07:35,801
Good Lord, I just had
to see him again.

1159
01:07:39,234 --> 01:07:43,000
You have those kind
of feelings, sweetie?

1160
01:07:46,934 --> 01:07:50,033
I don't know. I don't know.

1161
01:07:50,068 --> 01:07:52,868
When it's real, you'll know.

1162
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:55,601
Okay.

1163
01:07:57,133 --> 01:07:59,300
Let's say it was real.

1164
01:07:59,335 --> 01:08:00,300
Then what?

1165
01:08:00,335 --> 01:08:01,601
When you meet a man

1166
01:08:01,636 --> 01:08:03,901
who gives you
the warm fuzzies

1167
01:08:03,936 --> 01:08:06,334
all the way down
to your toes,

1168
01:08:07,701 --> 01:08:10,400
you look him
right in the eye

1169
01:08:10,435 --> 01:08:11,868
and kiss him.

1170
01:08:14,501 --> 01:08:17,067
Well, that's a little
forward, isn't it?

1171
01:08:17,102 --> 01:08:18,234
Damn right.

1172
01:08:18,269 --> 01:08:19,968
It's nothing
to be ashamed of

1173
01:08:20,003 --> 01:08:21,501
when you're in love.

1174
01:08:21,536 --> 01:08:26,334
You've got to go after
what you want, no apologies.

1175
01:08:26,369 --> 01:08:28,200
Go big or stay home.

1176
01:08:28,235 --> 01:08:29,734
That's what I say about it.

1177
01:08:29,769 --> 01:08:34,200
Why are you asking me
all these questions?

1178
01:08:34,235 --> 01:08:36,434
Um...

1179
01:08:36,469 --> 01:08:38,767
just research--

1180
01:08:38,802 --> 01:08:40,734
you know, for the--
for the new book.

1181
01:08:40,769 --> 01:08:44,133
Oh, of course. Research.

1182
01:08:44,168 --> 01:08:46,634
Of course I knew that.

1183
01:08:46,669 --> 01:08:49,400
You got any more
<i>research</i> questions,

1184
01:08:49,435 --> 01:08:51,300
you just come to me.

1185
01:08:51,335 --> 01:08:53,200
[chuckles]

1186
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:14,601
You seem to be spending
more time with this girl
than originally discussed.

1187
01:09:14,636 --> 01:09:15,734
Yes! I know, sir.

1188
01:09:15,769 --> 01:09:17,434
It's just that, um--

1189
01:09:17,469 --> 01:09:19,834
well, she's--
she's quite fun.

1190
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:22,467
What do you mean, fun?

1191
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:25,868
Well, in an irritating
sort of way--

1192
01:09:25,903 --> 01:09:29,167
I want this kept business.
Do you understand?

1193
01:09:29,202 --> 01:09:30,434
Yes, sir.

1194
01:09:30,469 --> 01:09:31,567
Good.

1195
01:09:32,801 --> 01:09:34,534
What about the manuscripts?

1196
01:09:34,569 --> 01:09:36,767
Oh, I had them removed
from the hotel this morning,

1197
01:09:36,802 --> 01:09:39,834
and everything's going
according to plan.

1198
01:09:39,869 --> 01:09:40,767
Good.

1199
01:09:46,133 --> 01:09:48,601
Have a good one.

1200
01:09:48,636 --> 01:09:49,534
Yes, sir.

1201
01:10:08,367 --> 01:10:10,567
[Maggie] Hi.
[Man] Hi.

1202
01:10:10,602 --> 01:10:11,801
[Maggie] Thanks.

1203
01:10:14,701 --> 01:10:17,701
Thank you. Okay!

1204
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:22,567
Go big or stay home.

1205
01:10:22,602 --> 01:10:24,901
So next time I see him,
I'm just gonna kiss him.

1206
01:10:24,936 --> 01:10:26,567
Gonna kiss him
right on the lips.

1207
01:10:26,602 --> 01:10:28,367
Maybe even
a little tongue.

1208
01:10:28,402 --> 01:10:29,734
All right, Mags. Don't
get ahead of yourself.

1209
01:10:29,769 --> 01:10:30,834

1377
01:20:18,669 --> 01:20:20,801
[door opens]

1378
01:20:20,836 --> 01:20:22,300
Hello.
Hi!

1379
01:20:23,601 --> 01:20:24,634
Good luck.

1380
01:20:27,367 --> 01:20:29,767
[panting]

1381
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:33,367
Um...

1382
01:20:40,234 --> 01:20:41,868
Ta-dah!

1383
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:47,868
Very cute.

1384
01:20:47,903 --> 01:20:50,033
Now say whatever it is
you gotta say.

1385
01:20:50,068 --> 01:20:51,734
Okay. Warm welcome.

1386
01:20:51,769 --> 01:20:54,300
Well, I'll-- I'll just
get straight to it, then.

1387
01:20:54,335 --> 01:20:55,634
Umm...

1388
01:20:55,669 --> 01:20:58,434
See... the thing is...

1389
01:20:58,469 --> 01:21:00,968
all my life, I have
sort of thought of myself

1390
01:21:01,003 --> 01:21:02,934
as a bit...

1391
01:21:02,969 --> 01:21:05,167
passionless, for lack
of a better word.

1392
01:21:06,734 --> 01:21:09,434
Until... recently.

1393
01:21:09,469 --> 01:21:11,400
See... [sighs]

1394
01:21:11,435 --> 01:21:13,901
The truth is, Maggie...

1395
01:21:13,936 --> 01:21:16,501
I've... fallen for you.

1396
01:21:16,536 --> 01:21:19,767
I... I think about you
incessantly,

1397
01:21:19,802 --> 01:21:22,801
and, um, I think that I...

1398
01:21:22,836 --> 01:21:25,567
[sighs]...love you.

1399
01:21:25,602 --> 01:21:27,400
Now, I-I-I-I realize that

1400
01:21:27,435 --> 01:21:29,033
I have a lot to live up to,

1401
01:21:29,068 --> 01:21:31,267
what with you writing
about princes and whatnot.

1402
01:21:31,302 --> 01:21:34,000
And though I may not have
rode here on my white horse

1403
01:21:34,035 --> 01:21:37,300
-- I can't ride -- um,

1404
01:21:37,335 --> 01:21:41,400
I will do everything
in my power

1405
01:21:41,435 --> 01:21:43,834
to make you feel
like a princess,

1406
01:21:43,869 --> 01:21:45,367
every day,

1407
01:21:45,402 --> 01:21:47,200
for the rest of my life.

1408
01:21:55,501 --> 01:21:56,934
Any response to that?

1409
01:21:58,100 --> 01:22:00,200
Really, anything at all
will do.

1410
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:03,834
Uh--

1411
01:22:03,869 --> 01:22:05,501
no.

1412
01:22:05,536 --> 01:22:07,400
I mean...

1413
01:22:07,435 --> 01:22:08,968
it doesn't really matter
what I feel,

1414
01:22:09,003 --> 01:22:10,934
or what I don't
feel for you.

1415
01:22:10,969 --> 01:22:12,200
The reality is,

1416
01:22:12,235 --> 01:22:13,467
I can't trust you.

1417
01:22:17,434 --> 01:22:20,000
You're right. I won't tell you
who the benefactor is.

1418
01:22:20,035 --> 01:22:22,267
See? I mean, I don't even
know why you came here--
I'll show you.

1419
01:22:22,302 --> 01:22:23,734
It doesn't even--
what?

1420
01:22:26,634 --> 01:22:27,767
I said I will show you

1421
01:22:27,802 --> 01:22:29,267
who your benefactor is.

1422
01:22:31,033 --> 01:22:32,167
You will lose
all of the money,

1423
01:22:32,202 --> 01:22:35,200
and I will be fined,
if not disbarred,

1424
01:22:35,235 --> 01:22:38,734
for breach of attorney/client
confidentiality. But, um...

1425
01:22:40,601 --> 01:22:42,567
for you, Miss Malone?

1426
01:22:42,602 --> 01:22:44,934
I'm prepared to break
the rules.

1427
01:22:44,969 --> 01:22:48,200
On one condition.

1428
01:22:48,235 --> 01:22:50,067
You let me finish
that kiss you started.

1429
01:22:52,534 --> 01:22:53,467
Hmm.

1430
01:22:55,434 --> 01:22:57,067
That's very sketchy
behavior.
Mm-hmm.

1431
01:22:58,234 --> 01:23:01,133
Trading kisses
for information.

1432
01:23:01,168 --> 01:23:03,601
Mmm.
Extortion. Blackmail,
some might say.

1433
01:23:03,636 --> 01:23:04,934
But...

1434
01:23:04,969 --> 01:23:07,267
But, alas, I seem
to have no choice.

1435
01:23:15,367 --> 01:23:17,033
[cooing, smooching]

1436
01:23:19,868 --> 01:23:21,801
[big sigh]

1437
01:23:21,836 --> 01:23:23,267
I've been, um...

1438
01:23:23,302 --> 01:23:25,300
thinking about you
incessantly, also.

1439
01:23:25,335 --> 01:23:26,367
Really.
Yeah.

1440
01:23:26,402 --> 01:23:27,801
Well, that works out well.
Mm-hm.

1441
01:23:27,836 --> 01:23:31,100
[chuckling]
[kissing, moaning]

1442
01:23:33,167 --> 01:23:35,334
Oh. I already spent
all the money.

1443
01:23:35,369 --> 01:23:37,467
Mm... good lord!
On what?

1444
01:23:37,502 --> 01:23:38,667
Umm... college.

1445
01:23:40,634 --> 01:23:43,033
A new roof.
And a security guard.

1446
01:23:43,068 --> 01:23:44,901
My God. Big spender!

1447
01:23:47,033 --> 01:23:49,701
I can't think of
anyone I'd rather
live in poverty with.

1448
01:23:49,736 --> 01:23:52,434
You say the sweetest things.

1449
01:23:52,469 --> 01:23:54,200
All right, enough about...

1450
01:23:54,235 --> 01:23:55,334
I am a man of my word,

1451
01:23:55,369 --> 01:23:56,901
and I still have to
pay out for that first kiss.

1452
01:23:56,936 --> 01:23:58,767
So, uh... let's bugger off.

1453
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:01,467
Oh. My sweater.

1454
01:24:04,100 --> 01:24:05,367
Wait! I don't have
any shoes!

1455
01:24:05,402 --> 01:24:06,801
Don't... forget your shoes.

1456
01:24:17,667 --> 01:24:19,033
I'll go check the study.

1457
01:25:00,667 --> 01:25:02,634
Can't find him.

1458
01:25:02,669 --> 01:25:03,601
Who's that?

1459
01:25:06,667 --> 01:25:07,667
That's me.

1460
01:25:10,934 --> 01:25:12,400
[footsteps]

1461
01:25:27,033 --> 01:25:28,133
Daddy?

1462
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:03,701
[church bells]

1463
01:26:22,267 --> 01:26:24,534
[soft chatter]

1464
01:26:28,167 --> 01:26:30,267
You must be proud.
Uh-huh!

1465
01:26:30,302 --> 01:26:32,734
[soft muttering]

1466
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:36,200
Hey, hey. Shh.
Calm down.

1467
01:26:36,235 --> 01:26:40,901
I'm nervous.
[laughs]

1468
01:26:40,936 --> 01:26:42,968
## <i>[church organ, loud]</i>

1469
01:26:47,501 --> 01:26:50,634
## <i>[wedding march]</i>

1470
01:27:37,367 --> 01:27:38,767
Thanks.

1471
01:27:42,367 --> 01:27:43,534
Hi.
Hi!

1472
01:27:57,300 --> 01:27:58,367
[Man in back]
Wait!

1473
01:28:00,901 --> 01:28:01,834
Maggie?

1474
01:28:20,534 --> 01:28:23,601
Don't make me run.

1475
01:28:23,636 --> 01:28:25,334
I've got a bum knee.

1476
01:28:27,834 --> 01:28:28,968
You don't recall?

1477
01:28:31,334 --> 01:28:33,367
[panting]

1478
01:28:35,033 --> 01:28:36,534
Do you have any
recollections of us?

1479
01:28:38,601 --> 01:28:40,367
You don't recall
when Mommy died.

1480
01:28:41,534 --> 01:28:42,667
[bitter laugh]

1481
01:28:44,801 --> 01:28:47,767
You and I hit
the road, kid.

1482
01:28:47,802 --> 01:28:49,167
Like a pair of hobos.

1483
01:28:50,767 --> 01:28:51,934
Mom was a...

1484
01:28:53,968 --> 01:28:55,367
'Course, we ended up
in the street.

1485
01:28:58,601 --> 01:29:01,133
How was I gonna button
my own shirt, let alone
tell you a story?

1486
01:29:03,734 --> 01:29:05,601
I gave you to a church.

1487
01:29:05,636 --> 01:29:08,234
Just to get my head
straight, you know?

1488
01:29:08,269 --> 01:29:10,734
I come back after
a few months.
They deny me access.

1489
01:29:12,300 --> 01:29:14,067
Then I go back to
the church, to petition
the records.

1490
01:29:14,102 --> 01:29:16,267
The records are sealed.

1491
01:29:16,302 --> 01:29:19,367
I had to get permission.
You talk about humiliation.

1492
01:29:19,402 --> 01:29:22,767
Had to get permission
just to write.

1493
01:29:22,802 --> 01:29:23,834
So I wrote.

1494
01:29:26,968 --> 01:29:29,434
I wrote you a letter a month,
for 10 years, Mags.

1495
01:29:31,601 --> 01:29:32,767
You never answered.

1496
01:29:37,334 --> 01:29:38,901
I figured you just
threw 'em away.

1497
01:29:41,567 --> 01:29:43,234
A few weeks ago, I'm
in London. I get a call

1498
01:29:43,269 --> 01:29:45,467
from some woman named Lettie.
She says she found
the letters.

1499
01:29:48,167 --> 01:29:49,501
Why?

1500
01:29:54,100 --> 01:29:57,033
The letters just
came too late.

1501
01:30:05,601 --> 01:30:08,000
You know how many years
I looked for you?

1502
01:30:11,100 --> 01:30:13,200
I named my first kitten
"Daddy",

1503
01:30:13,235 --> 01:30:15,000
just so I could
say it out loud.

1504
01:30:20,267 --> 01:30:22,901
But I'll call you
Bernard, for now.

1505
01:30:22,936 --> 01:30:24,133
If that's okay.

1506
01:30:26,234 --> 01:30:28,901
That is your name,
isn't it?
Yeah.

1507
01:30:28,936 --> 01:30:29,901
[sniffles]

1508
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:33,767
I gotta know
one thing, Bernard.

1509
01:30:33,802 --> 01:30:35,701
[sniffles]

1510
01:30:35,736 --> 01:30:38,234
Why the whole ruse?

1511
01:30:38,269 --> 01:30:40,267
You know, and
<i>Great Expectations</i>
and everything.

1512
01:30:40,302 --> 01:30:42,033
That was very creative.

1513
01:30:45,067 --> 01:30:46,934
Why not just call me up
and say,

1514
01:30:48,701 --> 01:30:50,968
"Hi. I'm your dad.

1515
01:30:51,003 --> 01:30:52,033
"Let's go to lunch."

1516
01:30:58,067 --> 01:30:59,701
I guess we get scared.

1517
01:30:59,736 --> 01:31:02,167
Right.

1518
01:31:03,534 --> 01:31:05,334
It's a common defect.

1519
01:31:09,100 --> 01:31:12,968
I would love nothing more
than to take you to lunch.

1520
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:20,400
Well, you know,
I've kinda got a wedding

1521
01:31:20,435 --> 01:31:22,334
to finish in there.

1522
01:31:27,167 --> 01:31:28,234
Well...

1523
01:31:30,033 --> 01:31:31,133
Shall we?

1524
01:31:33,334 --> 01:31:35,234
We shall.

1525
01:31:46,701 --> 01:31:49,133
Otherwise, why
would he come?

1526
01:32:02,801 --> 01:32:05,100
Okay, let's go.
Come on, come on.

1527
01:32:36,868 --> 01:32:39,334
You take care of
my little girl.

1528
01:32:39,369 --> 01:32:41,767
I will, sir.

1529
01:33:05,367 --> 01:33:12,968
# <i>Oh, when you</i>
<i>touch my hand</i> #

1530
01:33:13,003 --> 01:33:14,367
[laughs]

1531
01:33:16,367 --> 01:33:20,934
# <i>Oh, when you</i>

1532
01:33:20,969 --> 01:33:23,400
