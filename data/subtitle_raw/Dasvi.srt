1
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,125
Ready for the fitness challenge, Uncle?

2
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:20,583
Wait.

3
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,541
- Go.
- Start.

4
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:31,250
Push-up!

5
00:01:36,541 --> 00:01:37,416
Sit-up!

6
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:44,791
There you go, folks.

7
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:48,375
Ganga Ram Chaudhary is totally lit.

8
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:50,958
Fit, Uncle. Say you're fit.

9
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:53,166
Okay.

10
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,083
Once more.

11
00:01:57,666 --> 00:01:59,833
Ganga Ram Chaudhary is fit.

12
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:05,208
And I want to challenge
the President of America, Donald Trump.

13
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:08,875
No, President Mr. Joe Badan,

14
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:10,791
the President of Russia, Putni,

15
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:12,333
and the Canadian President…

16
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:15,333
What was his name?

17
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:17,083
Tridev?

18
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,875
Putin and Trudeau.

19
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,833
Okay.

20
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:23,458
President Putni and President Truedonay.

21
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:25,833
Trudeau is the PM of Canada, Uncle.

22
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:27,416
And I am the CM, dumbo.

23
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:29,875
This is such a pain in the neck.

24
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:33,041
Fit India!

25
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:34,250
Hit India!

26
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:36,333
Wake up, India! Go to sleep, India!

27
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:38,375
This is taking India down the drain.

28
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:40,375
Buzz off now.

29
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:41,708
I have lots to do.

30
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,083
Add some filters, put some hashtags
and post them on Twitter.

31
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:49,791
Mr. Bansal and Mr. Sharma
are here to meet you, sir.

32
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:52,250
I'd told you to keep that
annoying pair away from me.

33
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:55,291
Tell them I am not feeling well.

34
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:56,708
Okay.

35
00:02:57,875 --> 00:03:01,541
Hello, Mr. Sharma! Mr. Bansal!

36
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:04,416
You don't need to approach
this middleman to meet your brother.

37
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,583
We know you love us, Chaudhary Saab,

38
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,500
but we have to follow the protocol.

39
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:11,208
Brothers don't have to follow protocol.

40
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:14,000
Our hearts are glued together, after all.

41
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,625
Please.

42
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:19,291
Tell me.

43
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:21,916
What can I do for you?

44
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:26,000
Chaudhary Saab,
I had requested a land use change.

45
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:27,750
It didn't get me anywhere.

46
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,166
I heard they are building a school there.

47
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,333
A school?

48
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:34,000
Why do we need a school?

49
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:37,833
To educate everyone to be
an officer like this Tandon here?

50
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:41,208
Hey, Tandon. What is your
educational qualification?

51
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:43,666
I am an IAS officer, sir.

52
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:45,583
Topper of my batch.

53
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:46,750
Look at that.

54
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:48,333
He's a topper…

55
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:51,125
yet he works under me.

56
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:53,000
He has to follow my orders.

57
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,041
So, the lesson of the day is…

58
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:57,833
"Mall means money,

59
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:01,458
and school means unemployment."

60
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:15,833
- Long live Chaudhary Saab!
- Long live Chaudhary Saab!

61
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:17,416
- Long live Chaudhary Saab!
- Dinner?

62
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,333
What?

63
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,208
Would you be having dinner at home?

64
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:24,375
- Do you hear that?
- Long live Chaudhary Saab!

65
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:27,333
Ganga Ram Chaudhary
commands respect, but you?

66
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:31,000
"Would you be having dinner at home?"

67
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:34,083
You are not some cattle
I purchased at an animal fair.

68
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:35,625
You are my wife.

69
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,375
My Bimmo.

70
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,083
Speak up.

71
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,041
You are the CM's wife.

72
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:52,750
- Long live Chaudhary Saab!
- Long live Chaudhary Saab!

73
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:57,375
- Long live Chaudhary Saab!
- Long live Chaudhary Saab!

74
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:58,541
How are you doing, Goonga?

75
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:18,291
Sir, this police officer has
been harassing our party workers.

76
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:20,750
That's my job.

77
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:22,500
Have her transferred.

78
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,500
Breaking news!

79
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:36,541
Sessions court issues summons

80
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:40,291
for Harit Pradesh's Chief Minister,
Ganga Ram Chaudhary.

81
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:44,958
Ganga Ram Chaudhary has been summoned
for the teacher recruitment scam.

82
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:47,125
He has been accused
of criminal conspiracy,

83
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:51,208
misuse of power, bribery,
corruption, and cheating.

84
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:54,083
All the educational institutions and
teachers are displaying their resentment

85
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:57,041
against the state's most loved leader.

86
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:59,708
Will the Court take
strict action against him?

87
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:07,208
- Long live Chaudhary Saab!
- Sir!

88
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:10,166
Chaudhary Saab!
What do you have to say about this scam?

89
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,291
Chaudhary Saab, please tell us!

90
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:13,958
Listen, everyone.

91
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:19,000
I am clean, I was clean,
and I will always be clean.

92
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:24,333
I have fullam full faith in
the Indian Judicial System.

93
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,958
- Sir!
- One more question, please!

94
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:28,041
Chaudhary Saab!

95
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:29,041
Did you hear that?

96
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:30,583
"Fullam full!"

97
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:31,958
Who uses such language?

98
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:34,250
Should a chief minister
be using this kind of language?

99
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:35,958
Should a chief minister be linked

100
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:37,958
to a teacher recruitment
scam in the first place?

101
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:40,458
Now it's the Court's job
to deliver justice in this matter.

102
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:49,791
Under sections 120B, 420, 409, 467,

103
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:53,458
468, 470, and 477.

104
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:56,666
What is he doing? Learning how to count?

105
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:01,000
Covered all the sections,
haven't we, Mr. Sherawat?

106
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:05,125
These are the charges against your client,
Ganga Ram Chaudhary.

107
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,583
The Court sentences…

108
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:18,125
Breaking news!

109
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:22,708
Ganga Ram Chaudhary aka the monster
is being sent to judicial custody

110
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:27,000
while the SIT investigates
the teacher recruitment scam.

111
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:28,333
Chaudhary Saab, what now?

112
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:30,666
Wait.

113
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:34,208
You have been of no use…

114
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:40,250
so it's time for me to do
something about it now.

115
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:45,041
Don't be upset, Gulabo, my baby.

116
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:46,458
I know I am late.

117
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:50,000
Today, I'll feed you with my own hands.

118
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:51,958
Hold on.

119
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:55,791
- Hello.
- Time to take over the rein, Bimmo.

120
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:58,458
You are no longer the CM's wife.

121
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:00,166
You are now the CM.

122
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:02,083
Excuse me?

123
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:03,000
You heard me right.

124
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:04,916
Learn to speak up.

125
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:07,916
Hello?

126
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:22,875
HARIT PRADESH POLICE

127
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:26,625
HARIT PRADESH'S NEW CM
BIMLA DEVI CHAUDHARY

128
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:38,125
What did he drop?

129
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:39,500
He's seeking blessings.

130
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:40,958
Good God!

131
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:44,166
Why? He's even older than your uncle!

132
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:47,250
He wants blessings from the Chair.

133
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:50,541
Uncle says everyone respects the Chair.

134
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:52,666
I see.

135
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:53,833
Let him touch your feet.

136
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:04,041
- Long live Chaudhary Saab!
- Long live Chaudhary Saab!

137
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:07,750
- Long live Chaudhary Saab!
- Long live Chaudhary Saab!

138
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:11,458
- Long live Chaudhary Saab!
- Long live Chaudhary Saab!

139
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:15,208

140
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:18,500
- Long live Chaudhary Saab!
- Long live Chaudhary Saab!

141
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:19,708
Why did they stop?

142
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:22,000
You will have to go alone from here…

143
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:24,875
on foot, Chaudhary Saab.

144
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:27,791
You have to go through that door.

145
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:32,625
You want me…

146
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:36,666
to bow my head
and enter through that door?

147
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:41,166
I am a Chaudhary, bonehead.

148
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:42,833
I never bow.

149
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,791
I'd rather lose my head than bow.

150
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:46,958
Ask them to open the gate.

151
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:48,208
- You.
- Yes, sir?

152
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,416
- Open the gate.
- Excuse me?

153
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:51,708
Open the gate!

154
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:04,333
What's taking you so long?
Do you want me dead?

155
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:07,125
We have never unlocked it for anyone, sir.
It's become a little rusty.

156
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:10,666
Get me some oil! Now!

157
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:12,291
Give me that.

158
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,416
Here, oiled it.

Don't go overboard with
the overacting, Dilip Kumar.

175
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:11,250
Or else, the media peeps
will blow it out of proportion.

176
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:14,625
They're vicious to the bone.

177
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:16,291
No, this is all genuine.

00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,833
solemnly cuss…

183
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:44,458
I do swear in the name of God

184
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:47,583
that I will bear true faith and allegiance

185
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,375
to the Constitution of India

186
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:54,708
as by law established.

187
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,166
As Chief Minister of
the State of Harit Pradesh,

188
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:05,750
my duties will be

189
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:09,375
faithfully and conscience…

190
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:13,875
conscientiously discharged.

191
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:15,958
And that I will without fear…

192
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:17,291
SWEARING-IN CEREMONY

193
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,000
Without fear or favor.

194
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:20,750
…without fear or favor,

195
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:24,916
do right to all manner of people

196
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,791
with the Constitution and the law.

197
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,083
Madam, sign?

198
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,541
SWEARING-IN CEREMONY
HARIT PRADESH

199
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:42,666
This is your room, Chaudhary Saab.
With a window.

200
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:47,125
If I am staying here, then--

201
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,458
Now don't tell me you're
staying in prison in my place.

202
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:55,416
I am your devotee, Chaudhary Saab.

203
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:57,375
I will be right here,
always at your service.

204
00:12:58,291 --> 00:12:59,125
Come that side.

205
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:00,875
What is all this?

206
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:02,625
Your office.

207
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,916
Why two remotes for one television?

208
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:16,666
This will help you run the television…

209
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:22,500
and this will help you run the government.

210
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:30,541
You have managed to outdo
that highly-educated Tandon.

211
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:34,500
You are a topper
when it comes to flimflam.

212
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:36,791
Music!

213
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:47,166
What are you waiting for, bro?
Play some music!

214
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:00,791
Heave-ho!

215
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,625
Heave-ho!

216
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:06,250
Everything in this world needs a good push

217
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:07,750
Lock horn

218
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,500
Throw punches

219
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:12,708
At anyone who messes with you

220
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:15,708
Be unabashed

221
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:19,166
Just go for it, mate!

222
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:23,083
Be unabashed

223
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:25,541
Don't worry about the consequences

224
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:29,666
Just have a blast today!
Have a blast, mate!

225
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,833
Have a blast, mate!

226
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:36,208
Rewards and punishments don't matter

227
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:37,875
Have a blast, mate!

228
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:39,541
Just have a blast today!

229
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:42,750
Have a blast, mate!

230
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:45,875
Have a blast, mate!

231
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:46,916
Look at that.

232
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,750
The government that opposes education!

233
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,041
Have a blast, mate!

234
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,750
Just have a blast today!

235
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,958
Hello, Chaudhary Saab.

236
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:00,291
I am Ghanti.

237
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:02,791
Like a doorbell?

238
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,666
No, sir. My name is Balram.

239
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:10,041
You see, I steal bicycles,
hence the nickname.

240
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:12,750
You are in jail for stealing bicycles?!

241
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:14,625
How many did you steal?

242
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,375
4565.

243
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,250
That's quite a number.
How did you pull it off?

244
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:21,458
I used to change their seats.

245
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:24,291
Seat!

246
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,625
The Chair rules, mate.

247
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:29,500
He's Prem Qaidi, sir.

248
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:31,541
Rotate them clockwise.

249
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:32,750
What did you steal?

250
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:36,291
I was in love with a girl
who belonged to another caste.

251
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,541
And then I was framed.

252
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:40,666
Her caste?

253
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:45,125
Tell him. Go on, you party pooper.

254
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:47,833
Same as yours, Chaudhary Saab.

255
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:52,708
Forget about her then.

256
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:56,916
Leave this place,
and you'll be leaving this world.

257
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,083
That's Inamdar.

258
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,500
He's a civil engineer.

259
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,416
The name Imandar stuck
because he was honest.

260
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:05,208
His friends screwed him over.

261
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,458
Do you remember
the Vijaylakshmi project, sir?

262
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:11,875
Yes, of course.

263
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:14,833
It made me a lot of dough.

264
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:18,916
You are different, Chaudhary Saab.

265
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:22,625
Even if as a joke,
you at least accept taking kickbacks.

266
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:24,416
You are indeed quite a different leader.

267
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:28,583
Our sources told us that
Chief Minister Bimla Devi

268
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:30,416
keeps dozing off during assembly sessions.

269
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:34,041
Ganga Ram Chaudhary has been
running the government from prison.

270
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:35,875
- Listen.
- Our sole purpose is to make…

271
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:36,791
Send Goonga.

272
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,125
Don't worry, girl

273
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,833
I rule this place

274
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:44,041
Even the God of death is my mate

275
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:47,750
He says you are immortal, bro

276
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:50,541
You are special to Him for sure

277
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:53,708
Let everyone know

278
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:57,166
I'll destroy anyone who opposes me

279
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,500
I have the power
I am vicious to the bone

280
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:03,416
Bullets will be fired
No one will be spared

281
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,750
There are no rules

282
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,375
Just let loose

283
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:10,625
No one's gonna stop you

284
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,291
You have been given an opportunity

285
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:13,916
Just grab it

286
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,500
This is your day

287
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:19,375
If someone tries to stop you

288
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:22,875
Just get him out of your way

289
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:26,791
Be unabashed

290
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:29,166
Don't worry about the consequences

291
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:33,416
Just have a blast today!
Have a blast, mate!

292
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,625
Have a blast, mate!

293
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:39,958
Rewards and punishments don't matter

294
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:41,583
Have a blast, mate!

295
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:43,250
Just have a blast today!

296
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:46,541
Have a blast, mate!

297
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:49,791
Have a blast, mate!

298
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:53,083
Rewards and punishments don't matter

299
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:54,708
Have a blast, mate!

300
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:56,416
Just have a blast today!

301
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,291
Zip it, you bonehead!

302
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:15,750
Chief Minister Bimla Devi Chaudhary.

303
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,333
Good morning, Chaudhary Saab.

304
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:27,500
Wake up.

305
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:32,833
Chaudhary Saab, toilet or bed tea first?

306
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:35,541
Bed tea.

307
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:53,333
What is it?

308
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:56,125
You look like you have something to say.

309
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,958
You don't look quite devotional today.

310
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:05,208
Chaudhary Saab,
I need to tell you something.

311
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:08,000
Do you know Jyoti Deswal?

312
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:10,916
No.

313
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,833
Perfect.

314
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:13,500
She's our new superintendent.

315
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:14,791
She is already here.

316
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:17,500
She's an upstanding officer
who only plays by the rules.

317
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:21,208
Come on, bubblehead,
you know rules are for fools.

318
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:22,541
Tell me, how can we have her schooled?

319
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,666
We live in a country,

320
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:29,000
where officials get salaries
for not doing their job…

321
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:31,791
and get bribes to do their actual job.

322
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:34,666
She is very stubborn.

323
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,500
She can't be bribed.

324
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:38,291
And she doesn't fear anyone.

325
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:39,208
Don't fear her.

326
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:42,833
I'll have her transferred
if she causes too much trouble.

327
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,625
Great. It won't be long then.

328
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:51,000
What do you mean?

329
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:54,791
All the prisoners need to assemble at
the prison ground in the next 15 minutes.

330
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:56,375
I must leave.

331
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,666
You also need to be there.
Please be there on time.

332
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:08,708
- Jai Hind, madam.
- Jai Hind.

333
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:18,416
My name is Jyoti Deswal.

334
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:21,333
I am the new superintendent of this place.

335
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:22,916
Madam!

336
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:26,041
I am Sejwal, a Jaat.

337
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:29,750
This is Ravinder.
His sister is married to a Deswal.

338
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:33,291
I am a Dagar, madam.

339
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,000
Myself also same caste.

340
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:37,083
Just like you, madam.

341
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:38,291
Same to same.

342
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:40,208
- Really?
- Yes, madam.

343
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:41,875
What duty are you on?

344
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:43,750
I am in charge of the mess.

345
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:46,000
That's why this place is such a mess.

346
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:48,375
What do you mean, madam?

347
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:52,541
I mean, I am putting you on guard duty.

348
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:55,125
Go, stand there!

349
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,875
Go!

350
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:03,541
I don't want this rubbish happening again.

351
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:09,291
Why are you late?

352
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,833
Have trouble walking?

353
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:21,250
You question the man who
might have awarded you, girl?

354
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:25,333
I've received too many awards
in the last five years…

355
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:27,250
to remember all the awarders.

356
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:32,750
Today is my first day here.

357
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:35,041
We'll all have lunch together.

358
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:44,291
Is the food okay, madam?

359
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:50,750
What is this?

360
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:55,000
Even the animals are given
better food than this in my house.

361
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:56,666
Take it away!

362
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:04,375
All the prisoners eat this food.

363
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:06,333
What's troubling you?

364
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:14,708
I am the Government.
No one can dare to trouble me.

365
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:17,708
If someone still insists on troubling me,

366
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:22,500
then she too could face
the trouble of being transferred.

367
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:30,333
Seems like you watch a lot of movies,
Chaudhary Saab!

368
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:33,000
Couldn't you come up
with something original?

369
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:36,708
Get me his file.

370
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,125
Get the attendance register as well.

371
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:44,875
She is a tough chick.

372
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:48,083
No, she's a stone brick.

373
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:50,000
She'll turn you into mincemeat.

374
00:22:58,375 --> 00:23:01,375
He's been here for
a little over a month now.

375
00:23:02,208 --> 00:23:04,083
And I am sure that a brave,

376
00:23:04,833 --> 00:23:05,708
honest,

377
00:23:06,666 --> 00:23:10,125
and diligent jailer like you wouldn't
allow food from outside the jail.

378
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:13,958
So, has he been on a hunger
strike for one month?

379
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:17,958
Oh, no.

380
00:23:18,916 --> 00:23:21,416
Looks like you were in
a hurry and forgot to sign here.

381
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,416
Sign it.

382
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:41,583
One, two, three, four, five.

383
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:44,625
Here you go.

384
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:45,833
Oh, right.

385
00:23:46,541 --> 00:23:48,625
The famous five straight
strokes and a dot.

386
00:23:50,916 --> 00:23:52,708
I saw them on my transfer orders.

387
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:55,166
- Sir, this police officer…
- Buzz off!

388
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,791
has been harassing our party workers.

389
00:23:56,875 --> 00:23:59,166
- Turn off the camera! Turn it off!
- Have her transferred.

390
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:01,750
Is this really how you sign?

391
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:03,833
What is your educational qualification?

392
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:13,041
Eighth-grader.

393
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:14,791
Speak up!

394
00:24:20,541 --> 00:24:21,666
Eighth-grader.

395
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:22,625
Perfect.

396
00:24:23,416 --> 00:24:25,541
What kind of work do you
have for a middle schooler?

397
00:24:25,916 --> 00:24:26,791
Work?

398
00:24:27,541 --> 00:24:28,583
You want me to work?

399
00:24:29,083 --> 00:24:32,416
He could do laundry.

400
00:24:34,208 --> 00:24:35,333
He could do the dishes.

401
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:37,541
He could work as a gardener.

402
00:24:37,625 --> 00:24:38,500
And?

403
00:24:41,041 --> 00:24:42,333
He could clean the toilets.

404
00:24:42,708 --> 00:24:44,166
You'd better not forget who I am, girl!

405
00:24:46,125 --> 00:24:48,458
Don't forget that
I still control the Chair.

406
00:24:48,875 --> 00:24:50,166
Oh, yes. I remember.

407
00:24:51,375 --> 00:24:53,416
You are obsessed with chairs.

408
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,166
You will make chairs.

409
00:24:57,958 --> 00:24:58,833
Get him.

410
00:24:58,916 --> 00:25:00,041
- Okay.
- Now.

411
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,541
WOODCRAFT

412
00:25:08,666 --> 00:25:09,583
This is a saw.

413
00:25:10,125 --> 00:25:11,375
I am sure you have used one…

414
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,958
on the masses, on the administration,
and the government.

415
00:25:16,041 --> 00:25:18,791
Today, he will teach you its correct use.

416
00:25:20,041 --> 00:25:22,250
And take these things off.
They are not allowed in here.

417
00:25:22,833 --> 00:25:25,875
Had heard a lot about you, but now that
I've seen you in action, I know for sure.

418
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:27,541
- What?
- That you are a fearless tigress.

419
00:25:36,166 --> 00:25:37,083
Tandon.

420
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,708
Get the files we have
on all the party workers.

421
00:25:40,458 --> 00:25:42,041
I heard they are minting money.

422
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:45,083
You'll read their files, madam?!

423
00:25:45,625 --> 00:25:48,708
You'll read and I'll listen, topper.

424
00:25:49,708 --> 00:25:54,083
Madam, you remind me
of Chaudhary Saab when you talk like that.

425
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,208
Remember that I am the CM now.

426
00:25:59,666 --> 00:26:00,916
Easy. Be careful.

427
00:26:01,875 --> 00:26:02,875
By the way,

428
00:26:02,958 --> 00:26:06,625
politics isn't as easy as cooking a meal.

429
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,541
Can't say about cooking, sister-in-law,

430
00:26:09,041 --> 00:26:10,333
but it is certainly easier
than milking a buffalo.

431
00:26:10,708 --> 00:26:11,625
Really?

432
00:26:12,125 --> 00:26:14,166
Just keep the officers restricted
like you'd restrict a buffalo,

433
00:26:14,833 --> 00:26:18,166
entice the public with general
services like you'd entice a calf,

434
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,875
and keep foddering
the legislative from time to time.

435
00:26:21,375 --> 00:26:23,291
And if they don't listen,
just cuss them out.

436
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:26,625
I don't know how to cuss out.

437
00:26:27,291 --> 00:26:29,958
I could never speak up
before your brother.

438
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,416
That hurts!

439
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,833
You witch! Can't you see, harridan?

440
00:26:34,916 --> 00:26:39,000
You blind, vicious, old hag!
You crazy, dog-loving frump!

441
00:26:39,375 --> 00:26:40,250
You illiterate wench!

442
00:26:46,041 --> 00:26:46,916
Madam?

443
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:02,750
I am feeling so much lighter now.

444
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:05,750
I'll make sure your cell
has all the comforts of a home.

445
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:07,166
I'll make sure you get home-cooked meals.

446
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,333
I'll make sure you don't
face any trouble in there.

447
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:12,666
I'll make her coffin
before I make a chair.

448
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:13,666
You should.

449
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,833
How dare she!

450
00:27:15,833 --> 00:27:16,958
Enter, Chaudhary Saab.

451
00:27:26,291 --> 00:27:27,125
Close it.

452
00:27:30,333 --> 00:27:31,458
Let Bimmo come tomorrow.

453
00:27:42,291 --> 00:27:44,416
VISITING DAY

454
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,583
Bimmo, what should I do if
someone doesn't heed what I say?

455
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:14,875
You should not use a stick, dear.

456
00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:17,250
And certainly not on a girl.

457
00:28:18,125 --> 00:28:19,875
It will make newspaper headlines.

458
00:28:20,291 --> 00:28:22,875
And you know how these news channels work.

459
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,041
Get her transferred.

460
00:28:25,375 --> 00:28:26,375
I cannot tolerate her.

461
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:27,750
Transfer?

462
00:28:27,833 --> 00:28:28,750
I can do that.

463
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:30,416
You rule the state.

464
00:28:31,791 --> 00:28:34,208
Oh, no.

465
00:28:34,833 --> 00:28:35,750
We can't.

466
00:28:36,166 --> 00:28:39,125
She was transferred here on your orders.

467
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:44,166
It will send a wrong message
to the party if I get her transferred.

468
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:47,208
"Bimla Devi thinks she is
indeed the CM of the state.

469
00:28:47,291 --> 00:28:50,166
She is canceling orders
passed by Chaudhary Saab!"

470
00:28:50,916 --> 00:28:53,583
It will also send a wrong
message to the people.

471
00:28:53,666 --> 00:28:57,750
"Chief Minister Bimla Devi Chaudhary
is a biased politician."

472
00:28:58,333 --> 00:28:59,458
No way.

473
00:28:59,541 --> 00:29:03,416
I cannot let them defame you
by making such a big mistake.

474
00:29:09,166 --> 00:29:11,666
I see you've learned
the ropes of politics, Bimmo.

475
00:29:13,208 --> 00:29:14,416
Oh, come on.

476
00:29:15,625 --> 00:29:16,458
Thanks.

477
00:29:19,875 --> 00:29:21,291
I'll handle it.

478
00:29:21,708 --> 00:29:22,625
I've got your back.

479
00:29:23,333 --> 00:29:24,208
Can I go now?

480
00:29:24,875 --> 00:29:26,125
I have to attend the party meeting.

481
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:34,083
Photo.

482
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:36,833
Just hired her.

483
00:29:41,208 --> 00:29:42,958
See you. Bye.

484
00:29:50,166 --> 00:29:51,541
Vicious to the bone!

485
00:30:00,625 --> 00:30:03,166
Now I'll have to follow my heart…

486
00:30:04,833 --> 00:30:10,833
and become self-reliant.

487
00:30:19,208 --> 00:30:21,333
- Here?
- No. Not here.

488
00:30:23,041 --> 00:30:23,916
Then where?

489
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,666
- Here?
- Not here. There.

490
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:29,041
Come on, Chaudhary Saab!
Stop this here and there bullshit!

491
00:30:31,125 --> 00:30:35,708
No, I mean, why don't you
tell me where it actually hurts?

492
00:30:35,791 --> 00:30:37,833
Just find the right spot, Doctor.

493
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:46,250
Doctor.

494
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,500
This pain will only go away
if I am admitted to a five-star hospital.

495
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:53,500
Your stomach is in good shape.

496
00:30:56,083 --> 00:30:58,291
Next time,
make sure you say your liver hurts.

497
00:30:58,875 --> 00:31:03,083
I can refer you to a good hospital
for a liver ailment.

498
00:31:03,416 --> 00:31:05,500
My liver hurts, Doctor.

499
00:31:06,958 --> 00:31:07,791
Not here.

500
00:31:09,291 --> 00:31:10,166
Here.

501
00:31:10,791 --> 00:31:11,666
Right here.

502
00:31:12,125 --> 00:31:13,708
- Remember that next time.
- Okay.

503
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:16,583
- Open your mouth.
- Hey, Doctor.

504
00:31:24,875 --> 00:31:26,791
It takes seven minutes to make a chair.

505
00:31:26,875 --> 00:31:28,458
We have 17 people working here.

506
00:31:28,541 --> 00:31:31,166
We can make 102 chairs in six hours.

507
00:31:31,791 --> 00:31:35,958
So, we can make 2550 chairs in 25 days.

508
00:31:36,875 --> 00:31:38,541
What's out there?

509
00:31:39,625 --> 00:31:43,666
I have seen these boys go
for a stroll in the morning…

510
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:46,916
and then return in the evening.

511
00:31:47,833 --> 00:31:49,500
They go to the library, Chaudhary Saab.

512
00:31:49,583 --> 00:31:51,666
They are students.
They are studying to take exams.

513
00:31:52,375 --> 00:31:53,708
So they are exempted from work.

514
00:31:55,666 --> 00:31:57,083
They are just lazy.

515
00:32:40,666 --> 00:32:43,125
THE CM HAS SACKED MONEY
AS WELL AS EMPLOYMENT

516
00:32:43,208 --> 00:32:45,375
I AM CLEAN, I WAS CLEAN,
AND I WILL ALWAYS BE CLEAN

517
00:32:45,458 --> 00:32:47,833
MEANWHILE CHAUDHARY SAAB IN JAIL:
GOOD GOD! MY WIFE PLAYED WELL!

518
00:32:47,916 --> 00:32:50,291
CHAUDHARY SAAB IN JAIL:
I AM TERRIFIED

519
00:32:50,625 --> 00:32:52,625
I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE POSITION
I ONLY CARE ABOUT THE PEOPLE

520
00:32:52,708 --> 00:32:56,625
THE "C" IN "CM"
STANDS FOR CROOK

521
00:33:24,916 --> 00:33:25,833
Good one!

522
00:33:28,541 --> 00:33:32,291
THOSE WHO USED TO SIT ON A THRONE
ARE MAKING CHAIRS TODAY

523
00:33:40,583 --> 00:33:41,500
Come, Chaudhary Saab.

524
00:33:42,375 --> 00:33:43,208
Come.

525
00:33:44,458 --> 00:33:45,583
Come.

526
00:33:52,625 --> 00:33:53,958
Chaudhary Saab, come.

527
00:33:59,125 --> 00:34:00,041
Chaudhary Saab.

528
00:34:08,083 --> 00:34:08,916
Hey!

529
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,833
Namaste.

530
00:34:10,583 --> 00:34:11,500
Go.

531
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:12,458
Buzz off!

532
00:34:24,625 --> 00:34:25,500
Hello.

533
00:34:25,583 --> 00:34:27,708
I'm sure you must have had
a hearty laugh at my memes.

534
00:34:30,041 --> 00:34:31,625
What's the update on my bail petition?

535
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,375
Consider it done, brother.

536
00:34:35,083 --> 00:34:36,041
Hurry up!

537
00:35:03,833 --> 00:35:05,500
Justice Tripathi.

538
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:10,750
Cayman Islands.

539
00:35:11,708 --> 00:35:12,625
Switzerland.

540
00:35:13,875 --> 00:35:14,750
Mauritius.

541
00:35:15,916 --> 00:35:18,041
You can check out other
locations as well, sir.

542
00:35:18,125 --> 00:35:19,000
So, tell me.

543
00:35:20,208 --> 00:35:23,708
Where do I open your account
and deposit what amount?

544
00:35:50,375 --> 00:35:51,958
State versus Ganga Ram Chaudhary.

545
00:35:52,791 --> 00:35:53,666
Bail denied.

546
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:01,208
Excuse me, sir.

547
00:36:01,916 --> 00:36:03,916
Excuse me, sir, please wait.

548
00:36:06,541 --> 00:36:08,916
Justice Tripathi has sent this for you.
He said and I quote,

549
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,333
"Make such a mistake again, and you'll rot
in the cell right next to your brother's."

550
00:36:14,708 --> 00:36:17,208
We have just been informed that
the Court didn't waste any time

551
00:36:17,291 --> 00:36:18,875
and denied the bail petition.

552
00:36:19,208 --> 00:36:25,083
Justice Tripathi has decided
to slay the monster Ganga Ram Chaudhary.

553
00:36:25,166 --> 00:36:30,666
As the saying goes, "Playing with
fire will only get oneself burnt."

554
00:36:31,458 --> 00:36:33,375
You are such a well-known politician.

555
00:36:33,916 --> 00:36:35,666
Don't let this news dishearten you.

556
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,083
They'll have to grant
you bail sooner or later.

557
00:36:39,916 --> 00:36:42,750
God is just testing you.

558
00:36:54,833 --> 00:36:55,833
Test.

559
00:36:56,416 --> 00:36:57,291
Right.

560
00:36:59,791 --> 00:37:01,708
PLACE OF ALL FAITHS

561
00:37:11,833 --> 00:37:13,416
Making a grand entrance?

562
00:37:14,041 --> 00:37:15,375
What do you have for me today?

563
00:37:15,791 --> 00:37:17,625
A threat to transfer me or kill me?

564
00:37:18,875 --> 00:37:20,375
No threats.

565
00:37:21,416 --> 00:37:23,791
I am here to fulfill an old dream of mine.

566
00:37:25,458 --> 00:37:27,291
Which dream of yours has
remained unfulfilled?

567
00:37:27,625 --> 00:37:30,166
You already have a car,
a bungalow, and a hefty bank balance.

568
00:37:30,666 --> 00:37:32,500
And how can we forget the remote control!

569
00:37:33,166 --> 00:37:34,708
Spare me the sarcasm.

570
00:37:39,333 --> 00:37:42,458
This was my mother's dream as well.

571
00:37:43,708 --> 00:37:44,791
To see you in prison?

572
00:37:45,875 --> 00:37:46,750
No, madam.

573
00:37:47,583 --> 00:37:49,958
My mother wanted me to be well-educated.

574
00:37:50,833 --> 00:37:52,708
But as I come from
a family of politicians,

575
00:37:52,791 --> 00:37:54,208
I never had the time for all that.

576
00:37:54,541 --> 00:37:57,208
Now thanks to you and that kind
judge, I have ample time in my hands.

577
00:37:58,333 --> 00:37:59,916
So, what do you plan to do?

578
00:38:04,958 --> 00:38:05,875
A high school diploma.

579
00:38:19,416 --> 00:38:21,125
Don't find excuses to skip work.

580
00:38:22,291 --> 00:38:24,375
You wouldn't be in prison
if you'd completed your education.

581
00:38:24,458 --> 00:38:26,541
There is no correlation
between education and prison.

582
00:38:27,125 --> 00:38:30,166
Both Gandhiji and Nehruji studied
abroad, yet went to prison.

583
00:38:30,625 --> 00:38:32,291
I just want to get a high school diploma.

584
00:38:32,375 --> 00:38:37,541
And madam,
my right to education allows me to do so!

585
00:38:40,125 --> 00:38:41,250
Come on, Mr. Chaudhary!

586
00:38:42,333 --> 00:38:43,916
Where did you learn this dialogue?

587
00:38:45,375 --> 00:38:46,666
Do you even know what it means?

588
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,333
No.

589
00:38:49,041 --> 00:38:51,708
But this means that…

590
00:38:51,791 --> 00:38:54,875
Ganga Ram Chaudhary has
a right to education.

591
00:39:32,875 --> 00:39:34,250
Listen up, you petty criminals.

592
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,875
It's time you cut down on the noise.

593
00:39:38,375 --> 00:39:40,708
I am studying to get
a high school diploma.

594
00:39:45,833 --> 00:39:46,708
Listen!

595
00:39:48,833 --> 00:39:50,875
Where can I find books
for the high school diploma?

596
00:39:58,041 --> 00:39:59,166
Don't teach me.

597
00:39:59,958 --> 00:40:01,875
I have inaugurated many such libraries.

598
00:40:06,041 --> 00:40:07,458
Just inaugurated them.

599
00:40:08,166 --> 00:40:10,458
- If only you had spent some time in them--
- Spare me the lecture.

600
00:40:11,416 --> 00:40:13,291
Just tell me, where can I find books
for the high school diploma?

601
00:40:21,208 --> 00:40:23,000
Not that section, Chaudhary Saab.

602
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,291
That's for English. This way. Follow me.

603
00:40:32,708 --> 00:40:34,416
Listen, Mr. Library Man.

604
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:38,541
I am an educated Jaat,
who knows how to calculate fast.

605
00:40:38,625 --> 00:40:39,958
So, don't be smart.

606
00:40:40,625 --> 00:40:44,541
- And never-never, never-ever--
- Repetition.

607
00:40:46,333 --> 00:40:47,375
What?

608
00:40:47,458 --> 00:40:50,333
Repeating the same thing,
again and again, is called repetition.

609
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,458
It's a part of the Hindi syllabus
for the high school diploma.

610
00:40:54,583 --> 00:40:55,458
Here you go.

611
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:00,250
You'll need to be
thorough in English, Hindi,

612
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:03,000
social science, math, and science.

613
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:05,875
Repetition.

614
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:07,125
Excuse me?

615
00:41:07,541 --> 00:41:09,208
You said science twice.

616
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,416
Nice catch.

617
00:41:11,875 --> 00:41:12,958
But they are two different subjects.

618
00:41:13,541 --> 00:41:16,625
Social science includes history,
geography, and civics.

619
00:41:16,708 --> 00:41:17,875
Social science.

620
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:20,500
You seem to be a scholar.

621
00:41:22,291 --> 00:41:24,500
What did you do before you came here?

622
00:41:25,708 --> 00:41:26,625
I was a librarian.

623
00:41:27,708 --> 00:41:28,708
I used to read a lot.

624
00:41:29,791 --> 00:41:31,458
But knowledge alone doesn't
put food on the table.

625
00:41:32,958 --> 00:41:34,458
Desperate times, desperate measures.

626
00:41:34,958 --> 00:41:38,875
I started photocopying expensive
books from the library and selling them.

627
00:41:39,708 --> 00:41:42,541
And eventually, I got caught red-handed.

628
00:41:43,416 --> 00:41:44,708
- Mr. Rai Bareilly.
- Yes?

629
00:41:44,791 --> 00:41:46,125
Where can I find books on algebra?

630
00:41:46,208 --> 00:41:48,833
- In the next section, over there.
- Okay.

631
00:41:51,166 --> 00:41:52,791
Your name is Rai Bareilly?!

632
00:41:53,375 --> 00:41:57,041
Not everyone who comes
here is as educated as you are.

633
00:41:57,708 --> 00:42:00,208
Most of them pronounce
"library" as Rai Bareilly.

634
00:42:00,291 --> 00:42:02,083
Hence I am known as Rai Bareilly.

635
00:42:03,291 --> 00:42:04,125
Start studying.

636
00:42:08,541 --> 00:42:09,375
Rai Bareilly.

637
00:42:18,333 --> 00:42:19,666
Good morning, madam.

638
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:21,458
Good morning, Tandon.

639
00:42:22,666 --> 00:42:25,833
I'm having my effigy
installed at Rani Bagh.

640
00:42:26,958 --> 00:42:27,875
An effigy?

641
00:42:28,875 --> 00:42:30,083
So that people can burn it?

642
00:42:30,833 --> 00:42:34,666
No, so that people can admire it.

643
00:42:35,125 --> 00:42:37,833
I need to stay in sight to show my might.

644
00:42:38,333 --> 00:42:39,833
It'll increase my followers as well.

645
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:42,333
Oh, you mean a statue.

646
00:42:43,791 --> 00:42:46,375
But it will send
the wrong message to the public.

647
00:42:46,875 --> 00:42:48,416
If you'd do some work before you--

648
00:42:49,583 --> 00:42:53,375
I mean, if you'd reconsider…

649
00:42:55,208 --> 00:42:56,166
Serve me tea, Tandon.

650
00:43:02,125 --> 00:43:03,083
Sugar.

651
00:43:08,916 --> 00:43:09,833
Spoon.

652
00:43:13,541 --> 00:43:15,916
I think I need to change
my personal secretary.

653
00:43:16,333 --> 00:43:17,291
You should, madam.

654
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:21,583
I am sorry, madam.

655
00:43:23,875 --> 00:43:26,333
Your effigy, I mean, your statue…

656
00:43:26,875 --> 00:43:28,125
I am sure people will love it.

657
00:43:28,916 --> 00:43:30,000
Another advice!

658
00:43:31,166 --> 00:43:33,041
Advise me only when I order you to.

659
00:43:33,583 --> 00:43:34,416
Okay, madam.

660
00:43:35,083 --> 00:43:36,416
Did you hear that, sister-in-law?

661
00:43:37,333 --> 00:43:39,166
Brother plans to get a high
school diploma from prison.

662
00:43:39,708 --> 00:43:40,541
What?

663
00:43:41,666 --> 00:43:42,500
Madam…

664
00:43:43,541 --> 00:43:44,958
I think you should go
ahead with the statue.

665
00:43:45,041 --> 00:43:46,833
- That will take less time than--
- Shut up.

666
00:43:48,791 --> 00:43:51,750
Is this just a new gimmick
of his or a political move?

667
00:44:18,416 --> 00:44:20,333
- Long live Chaudhary Saab!
- Long live Chaudhary Saab!

668
00:44:20,416 --> 00:44:22,541
- May you prosper non-stop!
- May you prosper non-stop!

669
00:44:22,625 --> 00:44:24,625
- Long live Chaudhary Saab!
- Long live Chaudhary Saab!

670
00:44:24,708 --> 00:44:26,708
- May you prosper non-stop!
- May you prosper non-stop!

671
00:44:26,791 --> 00:44:28,708
- Whom do we want as our leader?
- Whom do we want as our leader?

672
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:31,083
- We want Chaudhary Saab to be our leader!
- We want Chaudhary Saab to be our leader!

673
00:44:31,166 --> 00:44:35,250
Chaudhary Saab looks
so innocent while sleeping.

674
00:44:41,083 --> 00:44:41,916
Chaudhary Saab?

675
00:44:42,916 --> 00:44:43,875
Chaudhary Saab!

676
00:44:45,041 --> 00:44:47,000
Chaudhary Saab… wake up.

677
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:04,583
These books are amazing, madam.

678
00:45:05,791 --> 00:45:07,416
They work like a sleeping pill.

679
00:45:08,166 --> 00:45:10,083
You start dreaming
as soon as you open a book.

680
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:13,750
What about your dream of
getting a high school diploma?

681
00:45:16,541 --> 00:45:20,000
You cannot dream
if you don't sleep, madam.

682
00:45:20,958 --> 00:45:26,916
Didn't Mr. Kalam say one should
sleep a lot in order to dream a lot?

683
00:45:28,416 --> 00:45:34,041
He said, "A true dream is something
that does not let you sleep."

684
00:45:36,125 --> 00:45:37,083
Oh, really?

685
00:45:38,208 --> 00:45:40,000
You don't get time off from work to sleep.

686
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:43,833
You either study for your high school
diploma or get back to making chairs.

687
00:45:47,333 --> 00:45:48,375
Keep an eye on him.

688
00:45:48,708 --> 00:45:50,125
This is just an excuse to skip work.

689
00:45:50,541 --> 00:45:52,583
- He's a cunning fox.
- Doesn't matter.

690
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:54,166
You are a fearless tigress.

691
00:45:56,333 --> 00:45:58,333
You are all addicted to bootlicking.

692
00:46:35,833 --> 00:46:38,083
Come on, my sweet sleeping pills.

693
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:06,833
"Those who do not learn from history
are doomed to repeat it."

694
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:18,291
Those who do not learn from history…

695
00:47:19,958 --> 00:47:22,625
are doomed to repeat it.

696
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:37,500
Those who do not learn from history
are doomed to repeat it.

697
00:47:47,791 --> 00:47:53,541
Those who do not learn from history
are doomed to repeat it.

698
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:20,291
- Simon, go back!
- Simon, go back!

699
00:48:20,375 --> 00:48:23,416
- Simon, go back!
- Simon, go back!

700
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:26,416
- Simon, go back!
- Simon, go back!

701
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:29,833
- Simon, go back!
- Simon, go back!

702
00:48:29,916 --> 00:48:33,333
- Simon, go back!
- Charge!

703
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:22,750
Where are you taking me?

704
00:49:22,833 --> 00:49:24,875
Police have resorted to baton
charges to quell the mob.

705
00:49:25,375 --> 00:49:28,458
Let's go over there. People are
waiting there to hear your speech.

706
00:49:28,541 --> 00:49:31,208
Yes, let's go. We need to wake
people up from their slumber.

707
00:49:32,583 --> 00:49:36,458
What are we protesting against, Lalaji?

708
00:49:36,541 --> 00:49:37,541
You don't know?

709
00:49:37,625 --> 00:49:38,500
No.

710
00:49:40,791 --> 00:49:42,000
Who are you?

711
00:49:43,083 --> 00:49:44,125
A student.

712
00:49:44,791 --> 00:49:45,708
A student?

713
00:49:48,833 --> 00:49:50,083
Which grade?

714
00:49:52,291 --> 00:49:53,208
Tenth grade.

715
00:49:56,666 --> 00:49:58,166
- Lalaji, your speech.
- Right.

716
00:50:07,541 --> 00:50:08,666
We have gathered here…

717
00:50:09,916 --> 00:50:15,791
to demand freedom of speech.

718
00:50:15,875 --> 00:50:17,708
Freedom of speech!

719
00:50:25,166 --> 00:50:27,125
Retract Rowlatt Act!

720
00:50:27,916 --> 00:50:29,083
Simon, go back!

721
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,541
British, quit India!

722
00:50:32,291 --> 00:50:33,500
Quit India!

723
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,458
Quit India!

724
00:50:35,541 --> 00:50:37,458
Quit it, Chaudhary Saab.

725
00:50:37,541 --> 00:50:38,375
Quit it.

726
00:50:39,875 --> 00:50:40,708
He quit.

727
00:50:47,708 --> 00:50:49,500
He keeps grooving when there is no beat

728
00:50:49,583 --> 00:50:51,375
He keeps swirling on repeat

729
00:50:51,458 --> 00:50:53,250
He's got himself into unwanted trouble

730
00:50:53,333 --> 00:50:55,125
Now his life's become a struggle

731
00:50:55,208 --> 00:50:57,000
He's a little mad and a little bad

732
00:50:57,083 --> 00:50:59,333
Looks like he's losing his mind
This lad, Chaudhary!

733
00:51:00,208 --> 00:51:02,708
This will shake the foundation
of the British Government.

734
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,166
Are you a reporter?

735
00:51:06,208 --> 00:51:07,041
No, Bapu.

736
00:51:07,291 --> 00:51:08,166
A student.

737
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:11,500
Oh, you are the one who's trying
to get a high school diploma!

738
00:51:12,083 --> 00:51:13,875
Yes, Bapu. How do you know?

739
00:51:14,833 --> 00:51:16,041
Lalaji told me.

740
00:51:17,666 --> 00:51:19,416
Like a cheetah, he growls

741
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,250
Then gets scared to the bones

742
00:51:21,333 --> 00:51:23,166
What he thinks comes true

743
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:25,041
His imagination comes to life too

744
00:51:25,125 --> 00:51:26,291
You never know what he'll do

745
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:28,541
He'll slap himself if he needs to

746
00:51:28,708 --> 00:51:35,708
Chaudhary's on a wild trip

747
00:51:36,083 --> 00:51:43,083
Chaudhary's on a wild trip

748
00:51:51,375 --> 00:51:53,166
He doesn't measure or weigh

749
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:55,083
Whatever is in his mind, he says

750
00:51:55,166 --> 00:52:00,333
Be smart and not stupid

751
00:52:00,416 --> 00:52:03,666
Chaudhary!

752
00:52:05,958 --> 00:52:07,041
What happened, Chaudhary Saab?

753
00:52:09,166 --> 00:52:10,666
Long live the revolution!

754
00:52:14,333 --> 00:52:16,208
He doesn't measure or weigh

755
00:52:16,291 --> 00:52:18,041
Whatever is in his mind, he says

756
00:52:18,125 --> 00:52:23,375
Be smart and not stupid

757
00:52:23,708 --> 00:52:25,541
He wakes up, gets enlightened
And goes to sleep

758
00:52:25,625 --> 00:52:27,416
Everything's done at his pace

759
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:32,500
He likes to give bad luck a chase

760
00:52:33,083 --> 00:52:36,833
It keeps falling to the left or right

761
00:52:36,916 --> 00:52:38,625
It keeps falling to the left or right

762
00:52:38,708 --> 00:52:40,125
He just cannot keep his head straight

763
00:52:40,208 --> 00:52:41,250
Chaudhary!

764
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:44,958
Chaudhary!

765
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:50,750
You should leave.

766
00:52:51,416 --> 00:52:52,333
This is certain death.

767
00:52:52,416 --> 00:52:54,541
Slavery is worse than death.

768
00:52:56,916 --> 00:53:00,250
What is the use of dying
without a reason, Azadji?

769
00:53:00,333 --> 00:53:01,166
Not without a reason.

770
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:05,916
I know, my death will set me free
and not my country.

771
00:53:06,375 --> 00:53:07,333
But my sacrifice…

772
00:53:09,625 --> 00:53:12,250
will pave a new path towards freedom.

773
00:53:12,875 --> 00:53:13,791
You should leave!

774
00:53:14,666 --> 00:53:15,583
What about you?

775
00:53:16,666 --> 00:53:17,958
This is my test.

776
00:53:18,458 --> 00:53:20,125
You should go prepare for yours.

777
00:53:21,583 --> 00:53:22,458
Go!

778
00:53:25,291 --> 00:53:28,708
Chaudhary!

779
00:53:29,416 --> 00:53:32,500
All wounds will heal and close

780
00:53:37,041 --> 00:53:40,041
We have taken the oath

781
00:53:40,791 --> 00:53:43,708
We have taken the oath

782
00:53:44,375 --> 00:53:47,875
Take a pledge

783
00:53:48,375 --> 00:53:51,875
We shall no longer stay oppressed

784
00:53:51,958 --> 00:53:55,375
All wounds will heal and close

785
00:53:55,791 --> 00:53:59,166
We have taken the oath

786
00:53:59,541 --> 00:54:03,208
Take a pledge

787
00:54:03,291 --> 00:54:06,833
We shall no longer stay oppressed

788
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:14,083
Enjoy your meals!

789
00:54:16,875 --> 00:54:19,083
He died so that you
all have your freedom.

790
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,291
But look at you dying for food.

791
00:54:22,833 --> 00:54:24,708
He has lost his mind.

792
00:54:24,791 --> 00:54:26,458
What a strange country we live in!

793
00:54:26,541 --> 00:54:28,791
He has lost his mind.

794
00:54:29,166 --> 00:54:34,833
Everyone wants a Bhagat Singh
but in the neighbor's house.

795
00:54:41,291 --> 00:54:43,958
Losing the Chair has
made him lose his mind.

796
00:54:44,333 --> 00:54:47,166
I think he is in shock.

797
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:48,541
He is not in shock.

798
00:54:48,625 --> 00:54:50,458
He is finding ways to go to a hospital.

799
00:54:50,541 --> 00:54:51,416
He's a cunning fox.

800
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:52,375
And you are?

801
00:55:02,541 --> 00:55:03,791
So what?

802
00:55:04,416 --> 00:55:07,708
Mental illness is a far better
excuse than a liver ailment.

803
00:55:08,375 --> 00:55:12,125
Depression is in fashion anyway.

804
00:55:12,208 --> 00:55:13,125
But madam, that will--

805
00:55:13,208 --> 00:55:16,958
That will send him to
a five-star hospital.

806
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:26,000
Well done, new CM.

807
00:55:27,791 --> 00:55:30,833
I went behind bars,
and you got brainpower.

808
00:55:31,416 --> 00:55:32,416
Good job, Bimmo.

809
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,458
What an idea, madam!

810
00:55:48,041 --> 00:55:48,958
Name?

811
00:55:51,125 --> 00:55:53,416
Subhash Mohandas Azad.

812
00:55:56,708 --> 00:55:57,875
What do you do?

813
00:55:57,958 --> 00:55:59,250
Nothing for free.

814
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,458
You need to answer our questions.

815
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,416
Give me blood,
and I will give you answers.

816
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:11,208
Do you remember that you are a politician?

817
00:56:11,291 --> 00:56:12,375
A politician?

818
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,583
I am not, I never was,
I never will be one.

819
00:56:15,666 --> 00:56:17,208
So you have never been a politician?

820
00:56:17,291 --> 00:56:18,625
- No.
- Try to recall.

821
00:56:20,333 --> 00:56:21,416
He is not crazy.

822
00:56:22,041 --> 00:56:23,291
He is trying to fool us all.

823
00:56:23,833 --> 00:56:27,125
Do you know he won the last
election by 4329 votes?

824
00:56:27,625 --> 00:56:30,708
And the one before that by 7399 votes.

825
00:56:32,666 --> 00:56:33,666
Madam!

826
00:56:34,875 --> 00:56:36,916
Please don't underestimate
the power of Chaudhary.

827
00:56:38,083 --> 00:56:42,250
I won the last election by 40,210 votes.

828
00:56:42,833 --> 00:56:46,708
And the one before that by 17,860 votes.

829
00:56:46,791 --> 00:56:50,875
I won the Village Council
Election by 6730 votes.

830
00:56:51,708 --> 00:56:54,875
Just 4329 votes, really?

831
00:57:01,708 --> 00:57:02,583
Any doubts?

832
00:57:10,333 --> 00:57:13,083
So, you've managed
to ruin my plan for freedom.

833
00:57:15,958 --> 00:57:17,250
Have you started drinking or what?

834
00:57:17,833 --> 00:57:24,041
Don't you know that a mentally unstable
person can never contest an election?

835
00:57:24,125 --> 00:57:27,250
Mental illness is a far better
excuse than a liver ailment.

836
00:57:30,083 --> 00:57:31,250
I didn't ruin your plan.

837
00:57:31,916 --> 00:57:32,791
I actually saved you.

838
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:36,708
I don't expect it,
but you can thank me if you want.

839
00:57:39,916 --> 00:57:42,333
You mean you did Chaudhary a favor?

840
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:44,333
Call it a favor if you want to.

841
00:57:45,625 --> 00:57:47,333
Now stop pretending to study
for the high school diploma.

842
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:49,333
Take him away. Get him to work.

843
00:57:49,916 --> 00:57:50,750
Listen up, girl.

844
00:57:53,208 --> 00:57:54,583
You really think I'll do as you say?

845
00:57:56,166 --> 00:57:57,375
Who do you think you are?

846
00:57:59,625 --> 00:58:01,916
I am someone much more
powerful than you are at the moment.

847
00:58:02,333 --> 00:58:05,250
You are just a prisoner here,
whereas I am the superintendent.

848
00:58:11,208 --> 00:58:13,666
You are very proud
of the position you hold, aren't you?

849
00:58:15,208 --> 00:58:17,000
It won't take me long to pull the rug.

850
00:58:19,166 --> 00:58:22,458
It won't take me long
to crush your ego either.

851
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:27,125
Remember,
bones take longer to heal as you age!

852
00:58:29,375 --> 00:58:30,750
You are an incompetent illiterate!

853
00:58:31,125 --> 00:58:32,916
You don't even know how
to talk to others…

854
00:58:33,333 --> 00:58:34,666
and you dream of running the country!

855
00:58:35,416 --> 00:58:39,750
You deserve to rot in this prison,
you uncouth bumpkin!

856
00:58:42,625 --> 00:58:44,041
Who are you calling an uncouth bumpkin?

857
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:49,166
I have crushed many like you!

858
00:58:50,041 --> 00:58:54,250
You will rot in this cage,
and Chaudhary will fly away!

859
00:58:55,875 --> 00:58:57,208
Chaudhary Saab!

860
00:58:57,291 --> 00:58:58,583
What's wrong, Chaudhary Saab?

861
00:58:58,666 --> 00:58:59,916
What's happening to him?

862
00:59:00,458 --> 00:59:02,583
What's wrong, Chaudhary Saab?

863
00:59:02,666 --> 00:59:04,833
- Step away!
- What's wrong?

864
00:59:04,916 --> 00:59:07,041
Don't crowd him.
Give him some breathing space.

865
00:59:07,625 --> 00:59:08,791
Someone call the doctor!

866
00:59:29,208 --> 00:59:30,750
CHIEF MINISTER'S OFFICE

867
00:59:36,166 --> 00:59:37,041
Okay, Doctor.

868
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:43,041
He had a heart attack.

869
00:59:44,333 --> 00:59:46,083
Thank God.

870
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:49,833
He'll now get to stay
in a private hospital suite.

871
00:59:50,166 --> 00:59:51,000
Shut up.

872
00:59:52,083 --> 00:59:53,375
It was a minor attack.

873
00:59:53,791 --> 00:59:56,416
The doctor said he was
treated on the spot.

874
00:59:57,625 --> 00:59:58,791
They gave him CPR.

875
00:59:59,333 --> 01:00:00,250
CPR?

876
01:00:01,833 --> 01:00:02,833
Who gave him CPR?

877
01:00:03,708 --> 01:00:04,541
Your mother.

878
01:00:05,541 --> 01:00:06,958
The superintendent.

879
01:00:07,875 --> 01:00:08,916
She's an angel.

880
01:00:10,125 --> 01:00:14,458
So she gave him CPR from the very
mouth she used to curse him with.

881
01:00:14,541 --> 01:00:15,500
Come again?

882
01:00:16,375 --> 01:00:17,500
- I--
- Her mouth?

883
01:00:19,166 --> 01:00:20,375
What about her mouth?

884
01:00:20,458 --> 01:00:21,625
What is CPR?

885
01:00:22,708 --> 01:00:23,791
Just a minute.

886
01:00:23,875 --> 01:00:25,125
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

887
01:00:25,208 --> 01:00:26,750
Don't give me the English mumbo jumbo.

888
01:00:26,833 --> 01:00:27,875
Wait a minute, madam.

889
01:00:28,916 --> 01:00:29,875
CPR.

890
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:33,083
Here, madam.

891
01:00:35,458 --> 01:00:37,750
Push hard and fast in
the center of the chest.

892
01:00:49,041 --> 01:00:49,916
Good God!

893
01:00:52,458 --> 01:00:57,166
She's a witch in an
angel's disguise, that frump!

894
01:01:04,125 --> 01:01:05,125
Get my car.

895
01:01:07,083 --> 01:01:09,083
Someone must be feeling
quite hale and hearty now.

896
01:01:12,333 --> 01:01:17,541
A kiss of life certainly
makes anyone feel…

897
01:01:18,708 --> 01:01:20,250
alive and kicking.

898
01:01:20,916 --> 01:01:22,000
Where is she?

899
01:01:23,708 --> 01:01:24,541
Sorry, madam.

900
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,875
I did what was necessary.

901
01:01:29,791 --> 01:01:30,625
Tandon!

902
01:01:31,416 --> 01:01:33,291
Didn't you say she is a junior officer?

903
01:01:34,375 --> 01:01:36,458
Even senior officials don't
dare to speak before me.

904
01:01:38,375 --> 01:01:40,000
You should be happy, madam.

905
01:01:40,833 --> 01:01:41,708
He is doing well now.

906
01:01:42,166 --> 01:01:43,166
Yes, of course.

907
01:01:43,833 --> 01:01:44,833
Everything is well.

908
01:01:45,583 --> 01:01:46,833
He is well.

909
01:01:47,166 --> 01:01:48,208
You are well.

910
01:01:49,541 --> 01:01:50,416
Well then.

911
01:01:52,791 --> 01:01:53,625
Bullshit.

912
01:01:55,125 --> 01:01:56,000
Excuse me?

913
01:01:56,083 --> 01:01:56,958
What did you say?

914
01:01:57,875 --> 01:01:59,750
Speak up.

915
01:02:00,583 --> 01:02:02,000
You are the CM's husband.

916
01:02:05,916 --> 01:02:07,541
- Ma'am…
- No photo.

917
01:02:15,791 --> 01:02:17,041
That's not funny.

918
01:02:19,416 --> 01:02:25,250
Power corrupts,
and absolute power corrupts absolutely.

919
01:02:26,125 --> 01:02:30,125
Enjoy your new identity, Mr. CM's husband.

920
01:02:32,583 --> 01:02:35,416
Get some rest. I'll check on you later.

921
01:02:36,666 --> 01:02:39,625
Yeah, get rest. You are going back
to making chairs from tomorrow.

922
01:02:41,583 --> 01:02:42,458
No chairs.

923
01:02:43,375 --> 01:02:44,375
High school diploma.

924
01:02:46,458 --> 01:02:48,250
High school diploma's
opinion polls are out.

925
01:02:49,375 --> 01:02:50,541
It's not your cup of tea.

926
01:02:54,375 --> 01:02:57,958
Wait for the counting, girl.

927
01:02:59,916 --> 01:03:02,583
Chaudhary always loses the exit poll,

928
01:03:03,166 --> 01:03:05,875
yet always wins the election.

929
01:03:08,416 --> 01:03:10,666
Chaudhary will get a high
school diploma at any cost.

930
01:03:11,166 --> 01:03:13,833
Because Chaudhary isn't
an uncouth bumpkin.

931
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:15,583
He is stubborn.

932
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:18,000
What if he is unable to?

933
01:03:23,541 --> 01:03:26,666
Then he will never be
a chief minister again.

934
01:03:35,875 --> 01:03:37,000
Fine.

935
01:03:37,083 --> 01:03:38,333
If he doesn't clear the exams,

936
01:03:38,416 --> 01:03:40,708
people of this state will be spared
from a chief minister like him.

937
01:03:41,416 --> 01:03:42,791
And if he does clear the exams,

938
01:03:42,875 --> 01:03:47,916
it will only lead
to the betterment of his life.

939
01:03:50,208 --> 01:03:51,541
Both side benefit, madam.

940
01:03:59,833 --> 01:04:01,625
Satpal here.

941
01:04:01,708 --> 01:04:04,250
The news of Ganga Ram Chaudhary's attempt

942
01:04:04,333 --> 01:04:07,791
to get a high school diploma
is as exciting as an election result day.

943
01:04:07,875 --> 01:04:11,166
This news has the speculative
market buzzing as well.

944
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:15,250
But the news that takes away the cake
is Ganga Ram Chaudhary's statement

945
01:04:15,333 --> 01:04:20,208
that his wife will continue
to be the CM if he fails in his attempt.

946
01:04:20,291 --> 01:04:22,416
This is Kavish Awasthi,
Number One, with you, always.

947
01:04:24,833 --> 01:04:28,666
It means I'll get to be the CM
even after he comes out of prison.

948
01:04:29,833 --> 01:04:31,541
This is suicide.

949
01:04:32,166 --> 01:04:33,791
It's going to be okay.

950
01:04:34,458 --> 01:04:35,666
He never listened to me.

951
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:37,291
Now don't stop him.

952
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,708
Let him do as he pleases.

953
01:04:40,541 --> 01:04:43,291
I will always support him
in good and bad times.

954
01:04:43,375 --> 01:04:44,250
And in the exams.

955
01:04:45,541 --> 01:04:47,583
I had made eight marriage vows, after all.

956
01:04:49,916 --> 01:04:51,000
Word.

957
01:04:52,375 --> 01:04:54,000
Eight marriage vows!

958
01:05:02,916 --> 01:05:04,208
Where is our CM?

959
01:05:04,583 --> 01:05:05,458
She's flying high.

960
01:05:06,583 --> 01:05:07,708
Did she turn into a kite?

961
01:05:07,791 --> 01:05:08,666
- No--
- She--

962
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:12,958
Brother… why do you need
a high school diploma?

963
01:05:13,875 --> 01:05:16,166
Failure would only ruin my reputation.

964
01:05:16,916 --> 01:05:17,791
I see.

965
01:05:19,291 --> 01:05:20,666
You have a reputation now?

966
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:24,791
I am Chaudhary Jaidev Ram's son.

967
01:05:25,958 --> 01:05:27,666
Be it the CM's post
or the high school diploma,

968
01:05:28,083 --> 01:05:30,875
I never shy away from a challenge.

969
01:05:35,083 --> 01:05:36,000
Tandon?

970
01:05:37,333 --> 01:05:40,666
Find out who conducts and supervises
these exams in the prison.

971
01:05:41,541 --> 01:05:43,125
Brother has to clear them at any cost.

972
01:05:45,958 --> 01:05:46,916
Well done.

973
01:05:47,375 --> 01:05:48,916
Well done, kiddo.

974
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:51,333
Everyone should have a brother like you.

975
01:05:52,041 --> 01:05:53,125
Come here.

976
01:05:59,875 --> 01:06:02,541
Don't treat me like a failure
before I actually fail.

977
01:06:05,041 --> 01:06:07,125
I have always made this mistake.

978
01:06:07,791 --> 01:06:10,250
Using schemes, quick fixes,
lie, or cheat to get my way.

979
01:06:10,333 --> 01:06:11,250
What did I gain?

980
01:06:11,625 --> 01:06:12,541
A prison sentence?

981
01:06:14,291 --> 01:06:18,291
Those who do not learn from history
are doomed to repeat it.

982
01:06:19,583 --> 01:06:20,458
You are right.

983
01:06:21,250 --> 01:06:27,416
But even a percentage here or there, and
the opposition will ruin your perception.

984
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:30,875
It is not necessary that someone
who has knowledge about politics…

985
01:06:32,291 --> 01:06:34,541
also has enough knowledge
to get a high school diploma.

986
01:06:47,208 --> 01:06:49,041
Get this straight, topper.

987
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:55,750
Your instigation will only lead me
to go for the civil services exam.

988
01:07:17,666 --> 01:07:18,500
Ghanti.

989
01:07:19,250 --> 01:07:20,583
I want you to help me prepare.

990
01:07:21,708 --> 01:07:22,750
For?

991
01:07:24,750 --> 01:07:26,291
How many rotis are made here in a day?

992
01:07:27,416 --> 01:07:28,500
Around 7000.

993
01:07:29,083 --> 01:07:30,375
Do you make them?

994
01:07:31,333 --> 01:07:32,791
There are 28 of us.

995
01:07:32,875 --> 01:07:34,333
So one person makes 250 rotis in a day.

996
01:07:35,291 --> 01:07:38,916
That. You need to teach me math.

997
01:07:39,666 --> 01:07:41,916
Forget the cycle repair shop,
I'll get you a cycle factory instead.

998
01:07:44,333 --> 01:07:45,208
Okay.

999
01:07:53,708 --> 01:07:57,541
The length of two tangents

1000
01:07:57,958 --> 01:08:00,708
drawn from an external point

1001
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:05,041
to a circle is equal.

1002
01:08:09,291 --> 01:08:14,416
Ghanti, honestly speaking,
these are just lines and dots for me.

1003
01:08:14,875 --> 01:08:16,208
It's all going over my head.

1004
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:20,541
Fine. Let's skip this.

1005
01:08:20,958 --> 01:08:24,125
You don't need a perfect score anyway.
You just need to clear the exam.

1006
01:08:24,791 --> 01:08:28,583
Look, I am only good at political figures.

1007
01:08:29,375 --> 01:08:31,166
I am a failure when it comes to real math.

1008
01:08:34,541 --> 01:08:36,083
Fine, let's try something else.

1009
01:08:38,916 --> 01:08:41,750
Tell me, how many voters
does Harit Pradesh have?

1010
01:08:42,375 --> 01:08:45,250
19,840,812.

1011
01:08:46,166 --> 01:08:47,625
As per the 2019 census.

1012
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:50,500
And how many state legislative
assemblies do we have?

1013
01:08:51,250 --> 01:08:52,916
- Ninety.
- Caste equations?

1014
01:08:53,583 --> 01:08:55,791
I have those figures on my fingertips.
You go back to teaching me math.

1015
01:08:56,333 --> 01:08:57,541
That's what I am doing.

1016
01:08:57,625 --> 01:08:59,000
Using the method that you know.

1017
01:09:00,458 --> 01:09:02,583
How many seats will you win in 2024?

1018
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:07,916
Keeping all the factors in mind,
the probability…

1019
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Exactly! Probability!

1020
01:09:10,083 --> 01:09:12,458
You should learn it.
It accounts for ten marks every year.

1021
01:09:12,875 --> 01:09:15,125
Yes, I am very good at probability.

1022
01:09:16,083 --> 01:09:17,000
Very good.

1023
01:09:17,958 --> 01:09:19,000
Here you go then.

1024
01:09:19,083 --> 01:09:21,208
- A pack of cards.
- I am not in a mood to play cards.

1025
01:09:21,291 --> 01:09:22,125
Get back to teaching me.

1026
01:09:22,875 --> 01:09:24,208
That's what I am doing.

1027
01:09:24,291 --> 01:09:25,208
Here's my question.

1028
01:09:26,208 --> 01:09:31,458
A card is drawn from
a well-shuffled pack of cards.

1029
01:09:32,333 --> 01:09:35,541
Find the probability of it being
neither a red card nor a queen.

1030
01:09:38,791 --> 01:09:40,125
We take out 26 red cards.

1031
01:09:40,208 --> 01:09:42,000
So, we are left with 26 black cards.

1032
01:09:42,083 --> 01:09:43,541
Take the two black queens out.

1033
01:09:43,625 --> 01:09:44,791
That leaves us with 24 cards.

1034
01:09:45,625 --> 01:09:48,125
A pack of cards has 52 cards,
so the probability is 24/52.

1035
01:09:48,458 --> 01:09:51,083
What is 24/52?
Can't you reduce it any further?

1036
01:09:57,750 --> 01:09:59,333
4X6=24

1037
01:09:59,666 --> 01:10:01,416
4X13=52

1038
01:10:02,083 --> 01:10:03,666
Divide them and we get…

1039
01:10:04,291 --> 01:10:05,208
6/13.

1040
01:10:09,125 --> 01:10:10,375
Check the answer.

1041
01:10:16,291 --> 01:10:17,250
Oh, Ghanti.

1042
01:10:19,041 --> 01:10:21,333
Have a blast, mate!

1043
01:10:21,416 --> 01:10:25,375
- You are God.
- Have a blast, mate!

1044
01:10:27,666 --> 01:10:30,625
Assume there is a party
that has a defector…

1045
01:10:31,041 --> 01:10:32,125
called acid.

1046
01:10:32,625 --> 01:10:33,541
Acid.

1047
01:10:33,625 --> 01:10:37,125
There is another political
party that needs this defector.

1048
01:10:37,916 --> 01:10:38,750
It's called the base.

1049
01:10:41,083 --> 01:10:42,000
Turncoat!

1050
01:10:42,750 --> 01:10:43,583
Opportunist!

1051
01:10:45,458 --> 01:10:48,708
When they come together,
they react and form salt and water.

1052
01:10:48,791 --> 01:10:50,208
Of course, they will benefit.

1053
01:10:50,541 --> 01:10:52,250
They'll get together
and make some dough.

1054
01:10:53,125 --> 01:10:55,333
Science is just like politics.

1055
01:10:56,833 --> 01:11:01,750
But Imandar, I'll need to change their
names to something I'll remember.

1056
01:11:02,208 --> 01:11:03,833
Hooda Chillar Lathwal.

1057
01:11:04,541 --> 01:11:08,333
HCL. Hydro Chloric Acid.

1058
01:11:12,166 --> 01:11:13,666
Chaudhary Saab, you are God.

1059
01:11:13,750 --> 01:11:14,666
No.

1060
01:11:16,625 --> 01:11:18,041
Ghanti is God.

1061
01:11:25,291 --> 01:11:29,000
"Ram is playing a good game of cricket."
This is an example of active voice.

1062
01:11:29,083 --> 01:11:30,250
What will be its passive voice?

1063
01:11:31,666 --> 01:11:32,625
What's that?

1064
01:11:33,541 --> 01:11:35,916
Instead of saying "Rai Bareilly
slapped Chaudhary Saab,"

1065
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,458
say, "Chaudhary Saab was
slapped by Rai Bareilly."

1066
01:11:42,375 --> 01:11:45,416
So, instead of saying…

1067
01:11:46,583 --> 01:11:48,833
"Rai Bareilly slapped Chaudhary,"

1068
01:11:49,166 --> 01:11:53,916
I need to say,
"Chaudhary was slapped by Rai Bareilly."

1069
01:11:54,291 --> 01:11:56,041
- Very good.
- How dare you, Rai Bareilly!

1070
01:11:56,125 --> 01:11:57,333
He's misbehaving with a teacher.

1071
01:11:57,666 --> 01:11:59,166
Don't get emotional, Goonga.

1072
01:11:59,916 --> 01:12:02,125
It was just an example,
not a true incident.

1073
01:12:02,208 --> 01:12:03,166
Right.

1074
01:12:06,916 --> 01:12:08,916
The batsman hit the ball for a six.

1075
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:16,166
The ball was hit for a six by the batsman.

1076
01:12:16,541 --> 01:12:17,500
Very good.

1077
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,375
Ranveer loves Deepika.

1078
01:12:19,916 --> 01:12:21,583
Everybody loves Deepika.

1079
01:12:21,666 --> 01:12:24,416
We want its passive voice, Chaudhary Saab.
Not your inner voice.

1080
01:12:25,125 --> 01:12:26,458
I was just joking.

1081
01:12:27,916 --> 01:12:30,375
Deepika is loved by Ranveer.

1082
01:12:31,708 --> 01:12:33,375
He does not obey his teachers.

1083
01:12:35,041 --> 01:12:38,000
His teachers are not obeyed by him.

1084
01:12:42,833 --> 01:12:43,958
That was a tough one.

1085
01:12:44,958 --> 01:12:47,875
Chaudhary Saab,
how did you get so good at English?

1086
01:12:48,875 --> 01:12:51,500
He looks so calm, so composed.

1087
01:12:51,583 --> 01:12:53,250
Wow, this is huge.

1088
01:12:53,333 --> 01:12:54,500
Bet ten on him.

1089
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,000
We are sure to win.

1090
01:12:57,416 --> 01:12:59,666
Harsha Bhogle is never wrong.

1091
01:13:00,625 --> 01:13:01,458
Yes.

1092
01:13:03,916 --> 01:13:04,791
Shot!

1093
01:13:05,583 --> 01:13:07,416
How did you run the government?

1094
01:13:08,166 --> 01:13:09,250
As I pleased.

1095
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:12,458
You are God.

1096
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,125
No, Ghanti is God.

1097
01:13:15,791 --> 01:13:19,583
Have a blast, mate!

1098
01:13:19,666 --> 01:13:23,500
Have a blast, mate!

1099
01:13:50,458 --> 01:13:53,041
Don't worry about the consequences

1100
01:13:53,125 --> 01:13:57,916
Just have a blast today!
Have a blast, mate!

1101
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:01,666
Have a blast, mate!

1102
01:14:01,750 --> 01:14:05,666
Rewards and punishments don't matter

1103
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:07,583
Have a blast, mate!

1104
01:14:07,666 --> 01:14:09,458
Just have a blast today!

1105
01:14:34,708 --> 01:14:37,083
Stonehearted has turned into a stone.

1106
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:38,833
What did you just say?

1107
01:14:39,208 --> 01:14:40,125
Madam…

1108
01:14:40,791 --> 01:14:44,958
I was just saying that's it's a piece
of art just like the Taj Mahal.

1109
01:14:45,041 --> 01:14:47,833
Madam, I think you should
chop off the hands of its sculptor.

1110
01:14:48,541 --> 01:14:51,791
This is a statue, not a mausoleum.

1111
01:14:52,791 --> 01:14:54,625
You seem to be very eager to see me dead.

1112
01:14:54,708 --> 01:14:56,125
- No, madam, I was just--
- Quiet.

1113
01:14:56,583 --> 01:15:00,791
Listen, you know that foreigner
who makes effigies?

1114
01:15:01,125 --> 01:15:03,666
I want her to have my statue in her shop.

1115
01:15:05,791 --> 01:15:06,833
At Madame Tussauds?

1116
01:15:06,916 --> 01:15:07,791
Yes.

1117
01:15:09,291 --> 01:15:12,166
But madam, she only does wax statues.

1118
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:15,666
I am not made of wax
to accept that as an excuse.

1119
01:15:16,666 --> 01:15:17,666
Use our contacts.

1120
01:15:18,166 --> 01:15:19,083
Useless!

1121
01:15:19,166 --> 01:15:20,125
Not you.

1122
01:15:20,666 --> 01:15:25,208
Madam, things do not work
that way overseas.

1123
01:15:26,333 --> 01:15:28,833
You are saying a lot of
anti-national things these days.

1124
01:15:30,583 --> 01:15:31,541
Bloody liberal!

1125
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:23,833
What is wrong, Chaudhary Saab?

1126
01:16:26,666 --> 01:16:27,833
I think I have the same disease…

1127
01:16:28,833 --> 01:16:31,625
as that kid in Taare Zameen Par
when it comes to Hindi.

1128
01:16:32,833 --> 01:16:33,833
Dyslexia?

1129
01:16:35,750 --> 01:16:37,041
Language doesn't matter in that case.

1130
01:16:37,666 --> 01:16:39,458
English will be just
as difficult as Hindi.

1131
01:16:40,250 --> 01:16:41,583
I have it when it comes to Hindi.

1132
01:16:42,750 --> 01:16:44,083
This is not how it works, Chaudhary Saab.

1133
01:16:45,333 --> 01:16:48,791
Imandar, you are an engineer,
not a doctor.

1134
01:16:49,958 --> 01:16:50,791
Fine.

1135
01:16:51,458 --> 01:16:52,708
Prem will help you.

1136
01:16:53,291 --> 01:16:54,541
He is very good at Hindi.

1137
01:16:54,625 --> 01:16:55,791
Have you ever heard his poetry?

1138
01:17:00,625 --> 01:17:03,541
I've never seen anyone look so
sad to leave this place, Prem.

1139
01:17:03,916 --> 01:17:05,791
You should be happy that
you're getting out of here.

1140
01:17:06,958 --> 01:17:08,333
I don't want to leave.

1141
01:17:08,833 --> 01:17:09,666
Why?

1142
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,125
You don't want to meet Preeti?

1143
01:17:11,583 --> 01:17:15,958
The monsters who have imprisoned
her will kill me, madam.

1144
01:17:17,458 --> 01:17:20,583
I am sorry, Prem, but I cannot keep
you here as you've been bailed out.

1145
01:17:21,166 --> 01:17:26,500
I'd rather die in this prison
than let the outside world kill me.

1146
01:17:32,041 --> 01:17:32,916
Chaudhary Saab.

1147
01:17:40,125 --> 01:17:41,041
Prem Qaidi.

1148
01:17:42,625 --> 01:17:44,083
Mountain came to Muhammad!

1149
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:47,291
I have been looking for you, bro.

1150
01:17:47,833 --> 01:17:51,750
I am doing well in all
the other subjects except for Hindi.

1151
01:17:53,416 --> 01:17:55,791
So there is something other
than your intention that is bad?

1152
01:17:57,333 --> 01:17:58,708
By the way, I am good on both fronts.

1153
01:17:59,916 --> 01:18:02,208
Tell me, will you help me?

1154
01:18:03,708 --> 01:18:06,041
No… because he is getting out of here.

1155
01:18:11,666 --> 01:18:14,000
That is great news!

1156
01:18:17,041 --> 01:18:19,125
But he needs your help.

1157
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:25,416
People of your caste have vowed to kill
him as soon as he gets out of prison.

1158
01:18:27,458 --> 01:18:29,125
So, the mountain did
not come to Muhammad,

1159
01:18:29,666 --> 01:18:31,208
Muhammad has come to the mountain.

1160
01:18:34,916 --> 01:18:37,333
The mountain is polluted with casteism.

1161
01:18:40,375 --> 01:18:43,375
And only you can clean it.

1162
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:46,791
Get them married right here.

1163
01:18:47,583 --> 01:18:48,708
I'll get the court orders.

1164
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,250
Can you do that?

1165
01:19:09,208 --> 01:19:10,541
You should wear this today.

1166
01:19:34,208 --> 01:19:35,541
This is your sister's wedding.

1167
01:19:36,166 --> 01:19:37,208
Smile.

1168
01:19:39,166 --> 01:19:44,041
And don't forget
to give her a wedding gift.

1169
01:19:44,416 --> 01:19:48,166
As you can see, there is
a wedding taking place in the prison.

1170
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:50,666
A feast has been prepared.
Sweets are being distributed.

1171
01:19:50,750 --> 01:19:55,041
Ganga Ram Chaudhary and the council
have blessed the couple.

1172
01:19:55,125 --> 01:19:57,958
This is a tight slap to casteism

1173
01:19:58,041 --> 01:20:00,833
by the seniormost high school
student, Ganga Ram Chaudhary.

1174
01:20:00,916 --> 01:20:01,833
And cut.

1175
01:20:02,583 --> 01:20:03,416
Water.

1176
01:20:06,625 --> 01:20:08,291
- What is your caste?
- Excuse me?

1177
01:20:08,875 --> 01:20:09,708
What is your caste?

1178
01:20:10,208 --> 01:20:14,041
Get them out of here from the backdoor
and take them to Mumbai.

1179
01:20:14,416 --> 01:20:15,333
Okay, brother.

1180
01:20:21,333 --> 01:20:23,666
How did you convince the council members?

1181
01:20:27,125 --> 01:20:28,416
Some of them respect me.

1182
01:20:29,708 --> 01:20:32,958
So I explained to them,
"Times are changing."

1183
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:38,625
As for the others,
I had a list of their sins.

1184
01:20:39,333 --> 01:20:41,625
So, I put that to use.

1185
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:44,875
Won't this affect your vote bank?

1186
01:20:46,666 --> 01:20:48,583
The votes I lose because of Preeti…

1187
01:20:49,041 --> 01:20:52,291
will get compensated by the votes
I'll win because of Prem Kumar.

1188
01:20:53,208 --> 01:20:54,833
This is .

1189
01:20:55,833 --> 01:20:57,166
And that is .

1190
01:20:59,875 --> 01:21:03,666
Only you can praise good deeds this badly.

1191
01:21:05,916 --> 01:21:06,875
I can see that…

1192
01:21:07,708 --> 01:21:10,541
studying for a high school diploma
has brought a lot of changes in you.

1193
01:21:11,541 --> 01:21:12,458
Good changes.

1194
01:21:14,958 --> 01:21:16,875
I haven't changed a bit, girl.

1195
01:21:18,750 --> 01:21:21,916
I just need to fulfill the challenge
of getting a high school diploma.

1196
01:21:23,875 --> 01:21:25,625
Chaudhary is never going to change.

1197
01:21:27,166 --> 01:21:28,875
Like that saying in English,

1198
01:21:29,916 --> 01:21:32,500
"A tiger never changes its stripes!"

1199
01:21:35,458 --> 01:21:38,416
But the tiger's stripes are quite
weak when it comes to Hindi!

1200
01:21:39,750 --> 01:21:41,208
How can he possibly roar with that?

1201
01:21:44,833 --> 01:21:46,875
STATE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY

1202
01:21:47,958 --> 01:21:48,791
Thank you.

1203
01:21:48,875 --> 01:21:49,750
It's okay.

1204
01:21:50,291 --> 01:21:51,583
Don't you want a selfie with me?

1205
01:21:55,416 --> 01:21:56,250
Why not!

1206
01:21:59,875 --> 01:22:01,666
You are temporary anyway.

1207
01:22:02,916 --> 01:22:06,041
Once Chaudhary Saab gets his high school
diploma, he'll be back permanently.

1208
01:22:08,916 --> 01:22:09,791
Good?

1209
01:22:12,250 --> 01:22:15,250
He'll be permanent only
if he clears the exams.

1210
01:22:16,083 --> 01:22:16,958
Permanent.

1211
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:32,833
That's enough.

1212
01:22:34,166 --> 01:22:35,125
If I get another attack,

1213
01:22:35,208 --> 01:22:37,083
people will be attending my funeral
instead of my graduation party.

1214
01:22:37,416 --> 01:22:38,500
Plan fail, madam.

1215
01:22:39,666 --> 01:22:40,583
What is he mumbling?

1216
01:22:41,583 --> 01:22:43,750
He has a habit of mumbling.

1217
01:22:43,833 --> 01:22:46,791
So, tell me, how are your studies going?

1218
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,916
I am weak in science,
so I am seeking Imandar's help.

1219
01:22:54,583 --> 01:22:56,500
I'll need to find someone
to help me with Hindi.

1220
01:22:59,166 --> 01:23:01,541
You have always been weak
in our mother tongue.

1221
01:23:02,208 --> 01:23:05,583
That's why you sign
with strokes and a dot.

1222
01:23:08,375 --> 01:23:09,208
Sorry.

1223
01:23:10,541 --> 01:23:12,625
Don't add fuel to fire,
Mrs. Chief Minister.

1224
01:23:12,708 --> 01:23:14,000
I have no trouble speaking it.

1225
01:23:18,416 --> 01:23:20,958
I just have trouble
reading and writing it.

1226
01:23:21,041 --> 01:23:23,250
Madam will solve all your problems.

1227
01:23:25,541 --> 01:23:29,083
I see he has gained another bad habit…
of meddling in other people's business.

1228
01:23:32,041 --> 01:23:33,041
Sorry, madam.

1229
01:23:33,125 --> 01:23:34,541
Meeting time is over.

1230
01:23:37,875 --> 01:23:40,583
She too has a habit of meddling
in other people's business.

1231
01:23:43,166 --> 01:23:45,875
I value time more than you do.

1232
01:23:48,791 --> 01:23:49,666
See you.

1233
01:23:53,625 --> 01:23:54,583
Take care…

1234
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:58,875
of science and our mother tongue.

1235
01:24:07,041 --> 01:24:10,250
Do you also want to taunt me?
Then go ahead.

1236
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,666
Where I come from, we don't kick the dead.

1237
01:24:27,833 --> 01:24:28,666
Womens!

1238
01:25:23,166 --> 01:25:28,083
Madam, have you watched the movie,
Taare Zameen Par?

1239
01:25:30,458 --> 01:25:31,291
I see.

1240
01:25:32,083 --> 01:25:34,125
That's why you sign
with five strokes and a dot.

1241
01:25:34,833 --> 01:25:35,875
Don't be rude.

1242
01:25:36,750 --> 01:25:37,791
That's my signature.

1243
01:25:39,083 --> 01:25:43,458
Try to recognize alphabets
with the words that begin with them.

1244
01:25:45,166 --> 01:25:47,250
Assume them to be that
party's election symbol.

1245
01:25:49,791 --> 01:25:54,166
Ghanti has been talking about
my learning methods. I see.

1246
01:25:58,625 --> 01:25:59,458
Let's do it.

1247
01:26:00,083 --> 01:26:01,291
Take a good look at this.

1248
01:26:02,375 --> 01:26:03,291
What is this?

1249
01:26:09,166 --> 01:26:10,333
A tap.

1250
01:26:12,250 --> 01:26:15,833
Look, the tap looks
like the alphabet "Na."

1251
01:26:16,583 --> 01:26:20,166
This is the elephant's face
and this is his trunk.

1252
01:26:20,875 --> 01:26:23,500
Elephant gives you the alphabet "Ha."

1253
01:26:29,625 --> 01:26:31,041
Rope gives you…

1254
01:26:31,666 --> 01:26:32,625
The alphabet "Ra."

1255
01:26:35,791 --> 01:26:37,041
Now you will be able to connect the two.

1256
01:26:37,833 --> 01:26:40,000
Now visualize
an elephant's election symbol.

1257
01:26:42,958 --> 01:26:43,791
I see it.

1258
01:26:45,166 --> 01:26:46,500
Now visualize a house's symbol.

1259
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,750
Now visualize them together.

1260
01:26:57,958 --> 01:26:59,583
The elephant is standing
right next to the house.

1261
01:27:01,541 --> 01:27:02,500
Let me show it to you.

1262
01:27:02,833 --> 01:27:04,291
That's "Hum" which means "us."

1263
01:27:05,208 --> 01:27:09,041
"Ha" and "Ma" come together to form "Hum."

1264
01:27:12,791 --> 01:27:13,708
Perfect.

1265
01:27:15,750 --> 01:27:18,833
So, we come together and form "Jag,"
which means the world.

1266
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:21,375
Jyoti and Ganga.

1267
01:27:22,375 --> 01:27:24,083
"Ja" and "Ga" come
together and form "Jag."

1268
01:27:37,666 --> 01:27:40,625
HINDI ALPHABETS

1269
01:27:56,291 --> 01:28:01,375
This is a new beginning

1270
01:28:01,458 --> 01:28:06,250
This is a new beginning

1271
01:28:06,625 --> 01:28:11,083
Something is making my heart sing

1272
01:28:11,166 --> 01:28:14,250
I don't like anything else anymore

1273
01:28:14,333 --> 01:28:16,916
I witnessed a miracle for sure

1274
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:20,416
I feel determined

1275
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:26,500
O my friend, I feel determined

1276
01:28:26,583 --> 01:28:29,750
I don't like anything else anymore

1277
01:28:29,833 --> 01:28:32,375
I witnessed a miracle for sure

1278
01:28:32,750 --> 01:28:35,791
I feel determined

1279
01:28:35,875 --> 01:28:42,208
O my friend, I feel determined

1280
01:28:42,291 --> 01:28:46,208
Determined

1281
01:28:46,583 --> 01:28:50,291
I feel determined

1282
01:28:50,375 --> 01:28:51,541
Call that witch!

1283
01:28:51,958 --> 01:28:53,541
Chaudhary Saab, calm down.

1284
01:28:53,625 --> 01:28:55,166
I'll teach you science.

1285
01:28:55,583 --> 01:28:57,958
You should be happy that
Imandar was bailed out.

1286
01:28:58,041 --> 01:28:58,875
Inamdar!

1287
01:28:59,208 --> 01:29:00,375
Right, Inamdar.

1288
01:29:00,958 --> 01:29:02,333
You…

1289
01:29:02,416 --> 01:29:04,041
Please, call her.

1290
01:29:23,750 --> 01:29:24,916
Excuse me, madam.

1291
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:29,375
It's me.

1292
01:29:29,458 --> 01:29:32,166
Yes, my caged tiger!

1293
01:29:32,750 --> 01:29:34,291
That doesn't stop me from roaring.

1294
01:29:35,333 --> 01:29:37,666
Why did you get Inamdar out on bail?

1295
01:29:38,125 --> 01:29:40,666
His wife came to me crying.

1296
01:29:41,125 --> 01:29:43,916
You know that he is an honest guy.

1297
01:29:44,541 --> 01:29:46,958
An inquiry was conducted,
and he turned out to be innocent.

1298
01:29:47,583 --> 01:29:50,166
Only a woman understands
how another woman feels.

1299
01:29:51,041 --> 01:29:55,083
Women like your superintendent
also know how men feel.

1300
01:29:55,541 --> 01:29:57,833
They know CRPF.

1301
01:29:57,916 --> 01:29:59,916
They don't shy away from
giving mouth-to-mouth.

1302
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:05,541
Mrs. Chief Minister,
don't soar too high like a kite.

1303
01:30:06,541 --> 01:30:08,333
Or you'll lose your path as soon
as someone nicks the thread.

1304
01:30:09,416 --> 01:30:10,875
I am very busy.

1305
01:30:11,416 --> 01:30:14,333
You are talking to the Chief Minister.
So, stop mouthing off.

1306
01:30:14,750 --> 01:30:16,833
Mouth off to someone else if you want to.

1307
01:30:16,916 --> 01:30:18,541
I am quite broad-minded, you see.

1308
01:30:21,791 --> 01:30:22,666
What happened?

1309
01:30:54,791 --> 01:31:00,375
- Long live Bimla Devi!
- Long live Bimla Devi!

1310
01:31:00,458 --> 01:31:05,166
- Long live Bimla Devi!
- Long live Bimla Devi!

1311
01:31:05,250 --> 01:31:10,250
- Long live Bimla Devi!
- Long live Bimla Devi!

1312
01:31:10,333 --> 01:31:11,916
WELCOME, MRS. BIMLA DEVI CHAUDHARY

1313
01:31:31,625 --> 01:31:32,833
In the teacher recruitment scam,

1314
01:31:32,916 --> 01:31:36,458
the court will hear the
closure report of the SIT on Monday.

1315
01:31:36,541 --> 01:31:38,583
But a lot of people are speculating

1316
01:31:38,666 --> 01:31:41,250
that it was not the former
Chief Minister Ganga Ram Chaudhary

1317
01:31:41,333 --> 01:31:45,333
but his ministers, his MLAs,

1318
01:31:45,416 --> 01:31:49,083
and personal secretary, R. P. Tandon,
who were the masterminds behind this scam.

1319
01:31:50,250 --> 01:31:51,291
Do it properly.

1320
01:31:52,083 --> 01:31:53,250
- Yes.
- Hurry up.

1321
01:31:54,125 --> 01:31:56,791
Excuse me, that cow just pooed.

1322
01:32:00,666 --> 01:32:01,541
Her name is Pinky.

1323
01:32:02,083 --> 01:32:02,958
Pinky.

1324
01:32:03,041 --> 01:32:03,875
Okay.

1325
01:32:05,416 --> 01:32:06,291
Madam!

1326
01:32:06,916 --> 01:32:11,250
I am ready to accept my mistake,
but what about the other party workers?

1327
01:32:11,333 --> 01:32:13,125
Don't worry about the party.

1328
01:32:13,666 --> 01:32:15,125
Just worry about yourself.

1329
01:32:15,833 --> 01:32:16,875
I'll do whatever you say.

1330
01:32:18,333 --> 01:32:20,333
Just save my skin.

1331
01:32:20,916 --> 01:32:21,833
Please, madam!

1332
01:32:23,541 --> 01:32:24,375
Madam?

1333
01:32:27,208 --> 01:32:28,666
Please.

1334
01:32:29,166 --> 01:32:30,041
Madam?

1335
01:32:31,125 --> 01:32:32,916
Madam, please. Just save me this time.

1336
01:32:33,291 --> 01:32:35,166
When are they holding the exams
for the high school diploma?

1337
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:50,458
- Chaudhary Saab.
- You're not allowed to run here.

1338
01:32:53,750 --> 01:32:55,333
There's bad news, Chaudhary Saab.

1339
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:58,625
How bad can it be! What is it about?

1340
01:33:01,958 --> 01:33:02,791
Hindi.

1341
01:33:13,833 --> 01:33:15,291
Madam, there's a letter for you.

1342
01:33:37,875 --> 01:33:38,708
Open your eyes.

1343
01:33:41,791 --> 01:33:42,666
What's wrong?

1344
01:33:43,083 --> 01:33:44,416
His stomach's fine.

1345
01:33:44,500 --> 01:33:45,416
No flu either.

1346
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:47,416
I don't understand
the reason behind the fever.

1347
01:33:47,500 --> 01:33:48,458
Is it because of stress?

1348
01:33:49,375 --> 01:33:50,333
Are you stressed?

1349
01:33:55,125 --> 01:33:56,250
Check the exam schedule.

1350
01:33:58,291 --> 01:33:59,958
The exam begins with Hindi.

1351
01:34:01,208 --> 01:34:03,375
Because everyone knows
that I am weak in Hindi.

1352
01:34:04,375 --> 01:34:05,500
In the first test itself…

1353
01:34:06,500 --> 01:34:08,041
You will clear the test.

1354
01:34:09,041 --> 01:34:10,708
You can score 20 marks
in the essay itself.

1355
01:34:10,791 --> 01:34:13,416
Essays are just like stories.

1356
01:34:13,958 --> 01:34:16,500
And you are an expert
at making up stories anyway.

1357
01:34:18,125 --> 01:34:21,625
You can memorize the prose
like you memorize speeches.

1358
01:34:24,875 --> 01:34:25,833
Exam fever?

1359
01:34:28,291 --> 01:34:29,625
Exam fever.

1360
01:34:55,083 --> 01:34:56,666
- What is it?
- Curd and sugar.

1361
01:34:58,625 --> 01:35:00,083
Something sweet for your first exam.

1362
01:35:23,333 --> 01:35:24,541
What are you doing?

1363
01:35:29,208 --> 01:35:30,875
Anyone who teaches you
something is your guru.

1364
01:35:38,875 --> 01:35:41,250
I have been wasting my life, madam.

1365
01:35:44,083 --> 01:35:45,416
I never listened to my mother…

1366
01:35:46,833 --> 01:35:48,208
or my teachers.

1367
01:35:50,833 --> 01:35:52,500
I performed sraddha every year,

1368
01:35:55,208 --> 01:35:56,500
but I always lacked dedication.

1369
01:36:01,458 --> 01:36:03,166
A high school diploma is the first step.

1370
01:36:05,041 --> 01:36:08,750
After that, you'll get an opportunity to
choose the subjects you are interested in.

1371
01:36:11,041 --> 01:36:12,958
If you already had a high school diploma,

1372
01:36:13,750 --> 01:36:15,041
I am sure you would've chosen history.

1373
01:36:20,291 --> 01:36:21,166
No.

1374
01:36:23,875 --> 01:36:25,583
I would've still chosen politics.

1375
01:36:31,458 --> 01:36:32,875
A tiger never…

1376
01:36:36,916 --> 01:36:37,791
Tiger.

1377
01:36:50,041 --> 01:36:52,000
ESSAY

1378
01:36:56,583 --> 01:36:59,250
I have never been this worried even
while appearing for my own exams.

1379
01:36:59,333 --> 01:37:01,375
Why would you be worried, madam?
You are a tigress.

1380
01:37:03,833 --> 01:37:06,916
Good. You finally agreed.

1381
01:37:20,875 --> 01:37:23,083
Our sources just told us

1382
01:37:23,166 --> 01:37:27,166
that Ganga Ram Chaudhary didn't
do so well in the Hindi exam.

1383
01:37:27,250 --> 01:37:28,916
This makes us wonder…

1384
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,875
how Ganga Ram Chaudhary speaks immaculate
Hindi, gives excellent speeches

1385
01:37:31,958 --> 01:37:36,291
when he comes to our
houses to seek our votes!

1386
01:37:36,375 --> 01:37:39,833
Why is he not doing well in the exam?

1387
01:37:39,916 --> 01:37:41,500
People of Harit Pradesh…

1388
01:37:42,250 --> 01:37:43,250
Did you write the essay?

1389
01:37:48,583 --> 01:37:49,625
Idioms?

1390
01:37:49,708 --> 01:37:50,708
Grammar?

1391
01:37:57,166 --> 01:37:58,625
You'll score enough to pass, right?

1392
01:38:02,916 --> 01:38:03,750
I don't know.

1393
01:38:04,750 --> 01:38:05,833
But how did he know?

1394
01:38:07,666 --> 01:38:11,208
It's a gimmick by the opposition
party to demoralize you.

1395
01:38:11,291 --> 01:38:12,208
They want you to fail.

1396
01:38:12,291 --> 01:38:13,791
The answer sheet is sealed.

1397
01:38:14,208 --> 01:38:16,291
No one knows how anyone
fared on the exams.

1398
01:38:17,583 --> 01:38:21,541
Now your fate depends on how honest
the person who checks your exam paper is.

1399
01:38:24,625 --> 01:38:26,541
I wish everyone were as honest as I am.

1400
01:38:33,500 --> 01:38:35,750
Give me blood, and I will give you…

1401
01:38:36,250 --> 01:38:37,375
The blood report?

1402
01:38:39,083 --> 01:38:40,500
Freedom.

1403
01:38:40,583 --> 01:38:41,875
I am just kidding.

1404
01:38:41,958 --> 01:38:43,625
That is the problem with your generation.

1405
01:38:44,166 --> 01:38:46,041
You think freedom is a joke.

1406
01:38:46,708 --> 01:38:47,875
You turn everything into a joke!

1407
01:38:50,541 --> 01:38:54,083
We have decided

1408
01:38:54,416 --> 01:38:58,208
To shine bright like the sun

1409
01:38:58,541 --> 01:39:02,666
Give wings to your dreams

1410
01:39:02,750 --> 01:39:06,625
If you want to soar high

1411
01:39:06,708 --> 01:39:10,791
We have decided

1412
01:39:10,875 --> 01:39:14,583
To shine bright like the sun

1413
01:39:14,666 --> 01:39:18,875
Give wings to your dreams

1414
01:39:18,958 --> 01:39:22,916
If you want to soar high

1415
01:39:29,125 --> 01:39:31,166
We have decided

1416
01:39:37,791 --> 01:39:39,041
We have decided

1417
01:39:40,125 --> 01:39:44,041
Stay determined

1418
01:39:44,125 --> 01:39:48,041
Aim for the sky

1419
01:39:48,125 --> 01:39:55,125
Make it bow helplessly before you

1420
01:39:56,791 --> 01:39:59,166
This question is based on probability.
They always ask this in the exam.

1421
01:39:59,541 --> 01:40:01,333
You take time to calculate.

1422
01:40:01,708 --> 01:40:03,666
So, solve it as soon as
you get the answer sheet.

1423
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:06,458
What if they don't ask this question?

1424
01:40:07,458 --> 01:40:09,500
Then you won't have to spend time on it.

1425
01:40:09,583 --> 01:40:11,375
And if they do,
you'll get ten marks for it.

1426
01:40:16,208 --> 01:40:17,625
What's the rush, Chaudhary Saab?

1427
01:40:18,708 --> 01:40:19,583
Rush?

1428
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:21,083
I am late by 30 years.

1429
01:40:21,625 --> 01:40:23,500
First, check if they've even
asked this question or not.

1430
01:40:38,416 --> 01:40:39,333
Damn it.

1431
01:40:39,958 --> 01:40:41,125
They didn't ask the question.

1432
01:40:41,208 --> 01:40:43,583
We have found from our sources
that Ganga Ram Chaudhary,

1433
01:40:43,666 --> 01:40:45,791
who has been doing everything
possible to get out of prison,

1434
01:40:45,875 --> 01:40:48,083
was granted bail a few days back.

1435
01:40:48,166 --> 01:40:51,333
He couldn't be in the court today because
he is appearing for the last exam,

1436
01:40:51,416 --> 01:40:54,833
but I think his brother
just paid him a visit.

1437
01:40:54,916 --> 01:40:56,875
Let's ask him about it.

1438
01:40:56,958 --> 01:40:58,958
What would you like
to say about this, sir?

1439
01:40:59,375 --> 01:41:02,375
People of Harit Pradesh
and all the party workers

1440
01:41:02,458 --> 01:41:05,083
want Chaudhary Saab
back on the CM's chair.

1441
01:41:05,166 --> 01:41:06,166
One last question--

1442
01:41:10,750 --> 01:41:13,375
He had said he won't go back
to being the CM if he fails.

1443
01:41:15,500 --> 01:41:16,708
This is Chaudhary Saab
we are talking about.

1444
01:41:17,708 --> 01:41:19,041
You never know when he'll
back out from his word.

1445
01:41:19,125 --> 01:41:19,958
But--

1446
01:41:20,541 --> 01:41:24,375
I am used to running the government.
I cannot go back to running the house now.

1447
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:28,583
You will have to leave the Chair, madam.

1448
01:41:28,666 --> 01:41:30,416
You just wait and watch, Tandon.

1449
01:41:30,791 --> 01:41:32,583
Bimla Devi will stay the CM of the state.

1450
01:41:40,541 --> 01:41:41,916
Call for a party meeting.

1451
01:41:44,500 --> 01:41:47,000
I am feeling sad, Chaudhary Saab.

1452
01:41:47,333 --> 01:41:48,291
Keep visiting.

1453
01:41:49,250 --> 01:41:50,375
For a cup of tea, I mean.

1454
01:41:54,625 --> 01:41:57,041
Why didn't you tell me about
the release order, girl?

1455
01:41:57,625 --> 01:41:59,583
If I had told you,
you would have left the prison

1456
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:01,500
and lost a challenge to a girl.

1457
01:42:02,500 --> 01:42:06,458
Now we are hoping that you'll clear
the exams and get back to being the CM.

1458
01:42:08,208 --> 01:42:11,000
Someone's learned politics.

1459
01:42:12,750 --> 01:42:14,541
Chaudhary Saab,
all I have learned is that…

1460
01:42:15,333 --> 01:42:18,041
you can change anything
if you set your mind to it.

1461
01:42:18,791 --> 01:42:19,916
Well, then…

1462
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:21,416
if you have learned something here,

1463
01:42:21,958 --> 01:42:23,791
then you should go and
help others out there.

1464
01:42:27,708 --> 01:42:28,791
Help others?

1465
01:42:30,875 --> 01:42:33,333
A tiger never changes its stripes.

1466
01:42:35,125 --> 01:42:36,250
Old dog, new…

1467
01:42:38,458 --> 01:42:40,250
You know the phrase.

1468
01:42:42,583 --> 01:42:45,833
Now open the gate.

1469
01:42:47,291 --> 01:42:49,125
Chaudhary didn't bow while coming in.

1470
01:42:50,125 --> 01:42:51,416
He won't bow while going out.

1471
01:43:05,416 --> 01:43:07,458
What? No grand welcome?

1472
01:43:19,250 --> 01:43:20,083
Brother--

1473
01:43:23,083 --> 01:43:24,416
Why are you here all by yourself?

1474
01:43:31,166 --> 01:43:32,083
Let's go.

1475
01:43:32,166 --> 01:43:33,791
So, going forward…

1476
01:43:42,625 --> 01:43:44,125
Your leader just got out of prison,

1477
01:43:44,208 --> 01:43:46,958
and you are here wasting
your time listening to her stories?

1478
01:43:47,500 --> 01:43:48,583
They're in a meeting with the CM

1479
01:43:48,666 --> 01:43:50,791
to discuss how to make
the state a better place.

1480
01:43:56,666 --> 01:44:00,958
The court orders told me who is doing
what to make this state a better place,

1481
01:44:01,041 --> 01:44:03,583
hand in glove with Tandon.

1482
01:44:06,541 --> 01:44:09,375
No minister with bad track
records can get a ticket.

1483
01:44:10,708 --> 01:44:12,833
Your track record isn't that good either,
Chaudhary Saab.

1484
01:44:17,166 --> 01:44:18,208
I know…

1485
01:44:20,458 --> 01:44:21,666
and I am going to change that.

1486
01:44:23,833 --> 01:44:25,500
Anyway, elections are due next year.

1487
01:44:26,500 --> 01:44:29,333
Let's dissolve the government
and declare an early election.

1488
01:44:31,833 --> 01:44:35,000
We will lose a year's worth of income.

1489
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:40,333
Profits take precedence over relationships
when it comes to politics.

1490
01:44:42,291 --> 01:44:43,791
CM is not in favor of this proposal.

1491
01:44:44,958 --> 01:44:46,875
You can seek party
workers' opinions as well.

1492
01:44:53,875 --> 01:44:56,875
Darling, I spent only a couple
of days with them in a resort

1493
01:44:56,958 --> 01:44:59,041
when I feared they'll switch sides.

1494
01:45:00,875 --> 01:45:03,000
But I have spent half my life with you.

1495
01:45:04,375 --> 01:45:07,500
If I don't have you by my side,
what can I expect from them?

1496
01:45:08,625 --> 01:45:11,625
We live in a democracy, so you
should seek their opinions as well.

1497
01:45:15,833 --> 01:45:17,625
All those who agree with me
should raise their hand.

1498
01:45:37,166 --> 01:45:39,041
Mrs. Bimla Devi…

1499
01:45:40,625 --> 01:45:42,000
people never follow a party.

1500
01:45:42,916 --> 01:45:44,458
They always follow their leader.

1501
01:45:47,583 --> 01:45:49,500
I'll make sure we have an early election.

1502
01:45:51,916 --> 01:45:57,750
Chaudhary has never stepped
down, and he never will.

1503
01:46:00,375 --> 01:46:01,500
Chaudhary will have to…

1504
01:46:02,791 --> 01:46:05,291
when he fails the exam
and loses the election.

1505
01:46:09,416 --> 01:46:11,875
By the way, how was your Hindi exam?

1506
01:46:13,375 --> 01:46:15,541
I heard they changed
the schedule and kept it first.

1507
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:22,083
Vicious to the bone!

1508
01:46:22,166 --> 01:46:24,166
Speak up.

1509
01:46:24,250 --> 01:46:27,333
Why do you forget
that you are the CM's husband?

1510
01:46:33,208 --> 01:46:34,708
Set up a meeting
with all the old sinners.

1511
01:46:41,708 --> 01:46:42,916
I have just one question.

1512
01:46:47,500 --> 01:46:48,333
Will you support me?

1513
01:46:48,458 --> 01:46:49,333
Of course.

1514
01:46:49,416 --> 01:46:50,333
I always have.

1515
01:46:50,416 --> 01:46:51,875
You have my support.

1516
01:46:51,958 --> 01:46:53,916
I can die for you, Chaudhary Saab.

1517
01:46:54,333 --> 01:46:57,083
But your track record has been tainted.

1518
01:46:57,750 --> 01:46:58,958
It's beyond repair.

1519
01:46:59,375 --> 01:47:01,041
People in our community
are not happy with you.

1520
01:47:01,125 --> 01:47:03,041
Party workers aren't happy either.

1521
01:47:03,125 --> 01:47:04,833
The vote percentage has gone down as well.

1522
01:47:04,916 --> 01:47:10,166
You have my full support,
but the people won't support you.

1523
01:47:10,250 --> 01:47:11,625
Times have changed.

1524
01:47:12,291 --> 01:47:14,916
This state needs young blood.

1525
01:47:16,166 --> 01:47:17,583
I am sorry, brother.

1526
01:47:17,666 --> 01:47:19,083
Goodbye, brother.

1527
01:47:19,166 --> 01:47:21,166
See you around.

1528
01:47:38,708 --> 01:47:39,583
Will you support me?

1529
01:47:49,125 --> 01:47:51,666
IT'S THE PUBLIC RESOLUTION
THAT CHAUDHARY IS THE ONLY OPTION

1530
01:47:51,750 --> 01:47:53,291
VOTE FOR EDUCATION AND SAVE THE STATE

1531
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,041
Everyone has two eyes,

1532
01:48:07,166 --> 01:48:09,875
but not everyone has true sight.

1533
01:48:12,291 --> 01:48:14,041
Everyone has a brain,

1534
01:48:15,500 --> 01:48:17,791
but not everyone has true knowledge.

1535
01:48:21,083 --> 01:48:26,041
The difference between eyes and sight,
brain and knowledge…

1536
01:48:30,166 --> 01:48:31,833
can be understood only
with the help of education.

1537
01:48:37,208 --> 01:48:40,208
ESSAY

1538
01:48:44,500 --> 01:48:46,333
EDUCATION

1539
01:49:14,666 --> 01:49:16,500
Education is a window to the world.

1540
01:49:17,333 --> 01:49:21,541
It changes your whole perspective.

1541
01:49:23,041 --> 01:49:26,708
It answers most of your questions.

1542
01:49:27,500 --> 01:49:30,875
Right from what are shooting stars
to why don't relationships last.

1543
01:49:31,750 --> 01:49:33,416
Humans climbed down the trees,

1544
01:49:34,250 --> 01:49:39,208
got out of the caves,
looked around, asked questions,

1545
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:43,333
and sought answers not
just for their betterment

1546
01:49:43,416 --> 01:49:46,000
but also for the betterment
of other animals.

1547
01:49:46,875 --> 01:49:48,916
Education took us to the moon.

1548
01:49:50,291 --> 01:49:53,458
But we think of it as nothing
but a source of income.

1549
01:49:55,833 --> 01:49:58,666
Education helps us question God.

1550
01:49:59,208 --> 01:50:01,708
Because God wanted us to question him.

1551
01:50:02,625 --> 01:50:05,416
He didn't send us on earth with a manual.

1552
01:50:06,625 --> 01:50:08,125
We have learned things the hard way.

1553
01:50:08,583 --> 01:50:11,291
We saw an apple fall on the
ground and figured out gravity.

1554
01:50:11,958 --> 01:50:15,541
We learned how to keep ships
afloat by discovering buoyancy.

1555
01:50:17,041 --> 01:50:19,250
We need to learn how
to educate ourselves.

1556
01:50:19,333 --> 01:50:20,750
How to think.

1557
01:50:21,208 --> 01:50:23,125
How to solve problems.

1558
01:50:25,666 --> 01:50:28,583
And know that miracles
don't happen overnight.

1559
01:50:29,625 --> 01:50:32,583
You need to work hard
and persevere for that.

1560
01:50:42,333 --> 01:50:45,541
Our country is strong and independent.

1561
01:50:45,625 --> 01:50:51,000
And all of us need
to contribute to making it better.

1562
01:50:51,708 --> 01:50:54,208
So, we need to fulfill our responsibility
toward our country and society.

1563
01:50:54,291 --> 01:50:56,500
We need to do our jobs right.

1564
01:50:56,875 --> 01:51:00,625
And education is a must
to do our jobs right.

1565
01:51:03,333 --> 01:51:04,833
To sum it up…

1566
01:51:06,416 --> 01:51:08,250
education is incomplete without knowledge,

1567
01:51:08,625 --> 01:51:11,208
and knowledge is incomplete
without experience.

1568
01:51:11,833 --> 01:51:14,250
You need both to make
this country a better place.

1569
01:51:15,375 --> 01:51:19,000
Otherwise, even if your
son is an electrical engineer,

1570
01:51:19,375 --> 01:51:22,958
you'll have to call the neighborhood
electrician to fix your ceiling fan.

1571
01:51:25,500 --> 01:51:27,250
This is not just political propaganda.

1572
01:51:28,875 --> 01:51:31,000
This is the first step toward education.

1573
01:51:33,333 --> 01:51:38,791
Education has even managed
to change a cunning fox like me.

1574
01:51:40,791 --> 01:51:45,958
I, Ganga Ram Chaudhary, will provide
free education to you and your children.

1575
01:51:55,708 --> 01:51:58,500
Long live Chaudhary Saab!

1576
01:52:01,875 --> 01:52:06,875
I, Ganga Ram Chaudhary, will provide
free education to you and your children.

1577
01:52:10,375 --> 01:52:13,875
He couldn't find any other issue,
so he made education an election issue.

1578
01:52:15,250 --> 01:52:16,166
Wonderful.

1579
01:52:17,291 --> 01:52:18,833
Results come out on the third, madam.

1580
01:52:19,708 --> 01:52:21,500
Of both, the election
and the high school diploma.

1581
01:52:21,583 --> 01:52:25,000
Then we will know whether
he is a tiger or a…

1582
01:52:37,916 --> 01:52:41,291
We have the most famous
confectioner in Harit Pradesh.

1583
01:52:41,375 --> 01:52:42,708
No matter who forms the government,

1584
01:52:42,791 --> 01:52:44,125
it is his sweets that
get distributed everywhere.

1585
01:52:44,208 --> 01:52:45,708
So how many orders do you have?

1586
01:52:45,791 --> 01:52:47,750
We are expecting a win.

1587
01:52:48,291 --> 01:52:50,083
So I was ordered to make
1500 kilos of sweets.

1588
01:52:50,166 --> 01:52:51,916
- Okay.
- After the exit polls,

1589
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,166
- we got orders to make 3000 kilos instead.
- Very good.

1590
01:52:54,250 --> 01:52:55,125
What do you think?

1591
01:52:55,208 --> 01:52:57,916
- Counting is just a formality.
- Okay.

1592
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,625
We already know the result.
We are forming the government.

1593
01:53:00,958 --> 01:53:02,833
- Have a laddu.
- Very good.

1594
01:53:03,291 --> 01:53:06,500
- What do you think, madam?
- Bimla Devi will be our CM.

1595
01:53:06,583 --> 01:53:07,750
And next time, she will be our PM.

1596
01:53:07,833 --> 01:53:08,708
Okay.

1597
01:53:09,208 --> 01:53:10,583
Next time, she will be our PM.

1598
01:53:10,666 --> 01:53:12,916
Bimla Devi will be coming down
any moment now.

1599
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:14,500
The red carpet has been
rolled out for her.

1600
01:53:14,583 --> 01:53:19,083
The crowd has been cheering for her.
She can already see her victory.

1601
01:53:19,166 --> 01:53:24,250
HARIT PRADESH PARTY SUPPORTERS
CERTAIN ABOUT THEIR PARTY'S VICTORY

1602
01:53:27,166 --> 01:53:29,041
Hello, everyone.
You are watching ABP News.

1603
01:53:29,125 --> 01:53:31,375
This is Shobhna Yadav.

1604
01:53:31,458 --> 01:53:34,083
It is a very big day for Harit Pradesh.

1605
01:53:34,166 --> 01:53:37,375
Former Chief Minister
Ganga Ram Chaudhary and

1606
01:53:37,458 --> 01:53:40,833
current Chief Minister
Bimla Devi Chaudhary

1607
01:53:40,916 --> 01:53:42,250
are competing against each other.

1608
01:53:42,333 --> 01:53:44,500
It's not only two politicians
competing against each other

1609
01:53:44,583 --> 01:53:46,583
but also a couple
fighting for their pride.

1610
01:53:46,666 --> 01:53:47,875
Counting has started, brother.

1611
01:53:47,958 --> 01:53:50,708
The initial trends suggest that…

1612
01:53:50,791 --> 01:53:51,875
- Call for the car.
- Bimla Devi

1613
01:53:51,958 --> 01:53:54,875
and all the other candidates
of Harit Pradesh Party

1614
01:53:54,958 --> 01:53:59,833
are currently leading against candidates
of Ganga Ram Chaudhary's coalition party.

1615
01:53:59,916 --> 01:54:02,916
You can see the results on
your television screens.

1616
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:06,666
We can see Bimla Devi's
candidates winning the race.

1617
01:54:06,750 --> 01:54:10,916
You can also see how disappointed
Ganga Ram Chaudhary looks here.

1618
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,583
This is how it is going to stay
from the beginning to the end.

1619
01:54:14,166 --> 01:54:17,500
All the candidates
of Harit Pradesh Party are very excited.

1620
01:54:17,583 --> 01:54:18,458
Are the results out?

1621
01:54:18,541 --> 01:54:20,875
But let me tell you something,
this is just the beginning.

1622
01:54:20,958 --> 01:54:21,958
We are all waiting for it.

1623
01:54:22,041 --> 01:54:23,583
We often see the tables turn

1624
01:54:23,666 --> 01:54:26,333
- I am talking about my exam results.
- at the last moment.

1625
01:54:26,416 --> 01:54:29,041
We are now going for a short break.
Keep watching ABP News.

1626
01:54:50,666 --> 01:54:52,875
NOTICE BOARD

1627
01:55:16,500 --> 01:55:19,750
Chaudhary Saab… you've scored 57 percent!

1628
01:55:20,708 --> 01:55:21,750
You passed the exams!

1629
01:55:27,500 --> 01:55:29,375
We have decided

1630
01:55:35,125 --> 01:55:36,583
We have decided

1631
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:46,250
NOTICE BOARD

1632
01:55:57,416 --> 01:56:01,375
We have decided

1633
01:56:06,291 --> 01:56:10,541
To shine bright like the sun

1634
01:56:14,083 --> 01:56:18,583
Give wings to your dreams

1635
01:56:18,666 --> 01:56:22,625
If you want to soar high

1636
01:56:22,708 --> 01:56:27,875
Chaudhary always loses the exit poll,

1637
01:56:28,958 --> 01:56:32,458
yet he always wins in the end.

1638
01:56:38,833 --> 01:56:39,791
Tiger!

1639
01:57:00,250 --> 01:57:05,166
O wanderer

1640
01:57:05,875 --> 01:57:07,833
AN HONORARIUM, THANK YOU- GANGA

1641
01:57:07,916 --> 01:57:13,375
O wanderer, your heart sets you apart

1642
01:57:13,458 --> 01:57:16,666
Don't worry, God will
Guide you to the right path

1643
01:57:16,750 --> 01:57:22,333
O wanderer, your heart sets you apart

1644
01:57:22,416 --> 01:57:25,625
Don't worry, God will
Guide you to the right path

1645
01:57:29,458 --> 01:57:33,375
The crowd that was bursting
crackers and celebrating with sweets

1646
01:57:33,458 --> 01:57:35,875
outside Harit Pradesh Party's
office yesterday

1647
01:57:35,958 --> 01:57:38,583
can now be seen outside
Yuva Swaraj Party's office.

1648
01:57:38,666 --> 01:57:41,833
Because Ganga Ram Chaudhary
has managed to ace both,

1649
01:57:41,916 --> 01:57:44,250
the election and the high school exams.

1650
01:57:44,333 --> 01:57:45,708
- He has won!
- Yes!

1651
01:57:45,791 --> 01:57:47,625
But…

1652
01:57:47,708 --> 01:57:50,708
let me tell you,
I had scored two percent more

1653
01:57:50,791 --> 01:57:52,666
than Ganga Ram Chaudhary in high school.

1654
01:57:52,750 --> 01:57:54,541
Fifty-nine percent-- Hey!

1655
01:57:55,583 --> 01:57:56,958
Put me down.

1656
01:57:57,666 --> 01:57:58,583
I said, put me down!

1657
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:00,875
Thank you.

1658
01:58:19,291 --> 01:58:20,708
You got a taste of power.

1659
01:58:22,583 --> 01:58:23,500
I did too,

1660
01:58:24,375 --> 01:58:26,375
many years ago.

1661
01:58:27,958 --> 01:58:30,541
This power blinds you.

1662
01:58:33,333 --> 01:58:34,958
I also got a taste of education.

1663
01:58:37,166 --> 01:58:39,000
Education empowers you.

1664
01:58:43,166 --> 01:58:45,333
It will take me some time
to come down from this high.

1665
01:58:50,666 --> 01:58:55,458
By the way, am I still your wife,
or have you formed another coalition?

1666
01:58:58,375 --> 01:59:00,416
You are the one who made
eight wedding vows, Bimmo.

1667
01:59:03,166 --> 01:59:04,791
I'll stay faithful
to the seven vows I made.

1668
01:59:21,333 --> 01:59:25,000
- Long live Chaudhary Saab!
- Long live Chaudhary Saab!

1669
01:59:25,083 --> 01:59:29,291
- Long live Chaudhary Saab!
- Long live Chaudhary Saab!

1670
01:59:29,375 --> 01:59:33,875
- Long live Chaudhary Saab!
- Long live Chaudhary Saab!

1671
01:59:34,541 --> 01:59:36,458
On behalf of the legislative party,

1672
01:59:37,875 --> 01:59:39,541
I propose that Mr. Ganga Ram Chaudhary…

1673
01:59:40,583 --> 01:59:42,416
be the next Chief Minister
of Harit Pradesh--

1674
01:59:47,833 --> 01:59:49,666
Math helps you win elections.

1675
01:59:50,708 --> 01:59:52,416
But you need to have
the right person…

1676
01:59:53,833 --> 01:59:56,000
in the right position
to run the government.

1677
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:04,625
I would be happy to have
an honest, young leader like you

1678
02:00:05,708 --> 02:00:07,291
as my chief minister.

1679
02:00:20,208 --> 02:00:22,208
Hear me out. Calm down.

1680
02:00:25,541 --> 02:00:27,458
I have set my eyes on another post.

1681
02:00:35,208 --> 02:00:37,500
SWEARING-IN CEREMONY
HARIT PRADESH

1682
02:00:37,583 --> 02:00:39,125
I, Ganga Ram Chaudhary,

1683
02:00:41,166 --> 02:00:46,166
do swear in the name of God
and my gurus, Mr. Ghanti,

1684
02:00:46,750 --> 02:00:51,833
Mr. Rai Bareilly, Mr. Inamdar,
and Ms. Jyoti Deswal,

1685
02:00:54,166 --> 02:00:55,958
that I will faithfully and conscientiously

1686
02:00:57,333 --> 02:01:00,416
discharge my duties as a Minister
for Education of Harit Pradesh.

1687
02:01:01,208 --> 02:01:03,625
Don't worry about the consequences

1688
02:01:03,708 --> 02:01:07,833
Just have a blast today!
Have a blast, mate!

1689
02:01:07,916 --> 02:01:11,041
Have a blast, mate!

1690
02:01:11,125 --> 02:01:14,458
Rewards and punishments don't matter

1691
02:01:14,541 --> 02:01:16,041
Have a blast, mate!

1692
02:01:16,125 --> 02:01:17,791
Just have a blast today!
