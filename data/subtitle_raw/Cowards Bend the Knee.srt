00:05:34,262 --> 00:05:37,611
Waiting...

A piece of warm pie...

37
00:08:34,831 --> 00:08:37,249
The calling card of...

00:08:39,682 --> 00:08:42,377
LILIOM
Proprietress...

39
00:08:44,252 --> 00:08:46,759

"No sugar before pie!"

44
00:10:57,404 --> 00:10:59,551
Meta never eats
her mother's pie.

45
00:11:26,772 --> 00:11:29,236
To stay or go?

46
00:11:51,198 --> 00:11:55,534
And so Guy forgets another
mother... the mother of his child.

47
00:11:55,535 --> 00:11:58,558
What sharp amnesias!

48
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:04,434
Addled Guy unknowingly performs
operations of his very own -
upon human hearts!

49
00:12:04,435 --> 00:12:07,394
And without anesthetics!

50
00:12:07,395 --> 00:12:13,896

CHAS!

65
00:15:20,202 --> 00:15:21,988
The sweetest hairdresser!

66
00:15:29,957 --> 00:15:31,902
Murdered!

67
00:15:36,239 --> 00:15:37,998

00:15:46,429 --> 00:15:48,267
"SHAKY!"

70
00:16:09,411 --> 00:16:11,095
"MY FATHER'S HAND!"

71
00:16:14,296 --> 00:16:16,602
Tightly bound by wire!

72
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:21,164
Severed!

00:16:32,167 --> 00:16:34,056
"They're blue!"

76
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:38,388
"From his lovely
hair dyes."

77
00:16:40,367 --> 00:16:42,156
BENEATH THE SINKS...

78
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:45,991

So Guy's heart falls into the
grasp of Meta, the new girl!

He loves her strong sense
of family, her fierce coyness,
her deep nostalgias.

86
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:08,951
This quivering, leaping heart
of his knows exactly what to do.

87
00:18:15,942 --> 00:18:21,543

from having an abortion.

186
00:44:20,216 --> 00:44:21,670
WITH MOTHER?!!

187
00:46:45,628 --> 00:46:47,540
FINALLY!!

188
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:57,728
"Are you happy NOW?!!"

189
00:47:29,419 --> 00:47:32,828
Liliom dispatched!
Guy's promise kept! ...

190
00:47:32,829 --> 00:47:38,285
...He now believes his
obligations to the vengeful
daughter are complete.

191
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:53,561
"PLEASE CUT THESE
WRETCHED MURDERERS OFF ME!"

192
00:48:07,622 --> 00:48:10,047
"You silly boy!
These are your own hands!"

193
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,245
"The transplant was a hoax!"

194
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:29,759
"You silly, silly fool!"

195
00:48:32,167 --> 00:48:41,858
Capricious Meta awakens
from her swoon to a world
hung in black.

196
00:48:49,293 --> 00:48:51,120
META CHEWS SLOWLY...

197
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:57,874
THE LAST PIECE OF PIE...

198
00:49:02,829 --> 00:49:04,479
BAKED BY HER MOTHER...

199
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:10,295
BEFORE SHE DIED.

200

CHAPTER EIGHT

201
00:49:25,269 --> 00:49:30,063
Chapter Nine
HANDS OFF!

202
00:49:33,733 --> 00:49:35,851
"We're through, Guy!"

203
00:49:40,474 --> 00:49:42,713
"Just confess.
You love the new girl."

204
00:49:46,158 --> 00:49:48,023
"Well, I guess... I do."

205
00:49:49,607 --> 00:49:52,220
"Then I want my
father's hands back!"

206
00:50:37,517 --> 00:50:39,081
MINUTES AFTER THE OPERATION

207
00:50:41,483 --> 00:50:44,076
NEWLY FREED GUY GOES
DIRECTLY TO THE ARENA

208
00:51:05,662 --> 00:51:08,354
THE CARDS FORETELL
A MYSTERIOUS APOCALYPSE

209
00:51:15,727 --> 00:51:17,026
MEANWHILE...

210
00:51:35,983 --> 00:51:37,758
BACK WITH HIS BUDDIES

211
00:52:21,905 --> 00:52:24,108
"I see you still need
your hand held."

212
00:53:01,929 --> 00:53:04,216
"You're as cold as I am!"

213
00:53:06,323 --> 00:53:08,423
"I LIKE IT, SOMEHOW!"

214
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:21,449
"Tonight you shall know
how it feels to have
a slain father!"

215
00:53:54,759 --> 00:53:57,632
MAROONS SWEAR
VENGEANCE ON SOVIETS!

216
00:54:41,330 --> 00:54:44,315
Up on the catwalk,
a game of a different sort.

217
00:54:59,650 --> 00:55:04,408
Veronica's ghost traces
and retraces her steps
high above the rink...

218
00:55:04,409 --> 00:55:09,390
...stepping cruelly
across the surface of
Guy's fevered brain...

219
00:55:09,391 --> 00:55:13,550
...and onto his panting,
aching breast.

CHAPTER NINE

221
00:55:34,641 --> 00:55:39,378
Chapter Ten
THE FURIES

222
00:55:51,265 --> 00:55:53,691
THE SUMMONS
OF THE ICE BREAST

223
00:56:39,198 --> 00:56:41,032
TO THE CATWALK!

224
00:56:42,797 --> 00:56:44,413
LOOKING FOR A KILLER.

225
00:56:53,063 --> 00:56:55,349
GUY'S BELOVED!

226
00:57:08,786 --> 00:57:11,238
"SON, MEET YOUR
NEW MOTHER."

227
00:57:44,518 --> 00:57:47,919
"Please, my love.
Remember your heart."

228
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:10,514
"I've loved your father
my entire life!"

229
00:58:12,388 --> 00:58:13,190
"Wax Maroons!"

230
00:58:14,285 --> 00:58:15,299
"Immortals!"

231
00:58:16,202 --> 00:58:17,397
"Awake!"

232
00:58:21,144 --> 00:58:23,159
"Put an end
to this travesty!"

233
00:58:24,542 --> 00:58:26,271
"Julian Klymberger!
Awake! I need you!"

234
00:58:27,973 --> 00:58:28,872
Hind Bauer!

235
00:58:28,873 --> 00:58:29,844
Awake!

236
00:58:29,845 --> 00:58:30,645
I need you!

237
00:58:33,175 --> 00:58:34,203
"The rest of you!"

238
00:58:36,810 --> 00:58:37,911
"Great men!"

239
00:58:38,777 --> 00:58:39,880
"WAXMEN!"

240
00:58:41,717 --> 00:58:43,024
"Hear my pleas!"

241
00:58:46,193 --> 00:58:46,993
Awake!

242
00:59:29,654 --> 00:59:30,724
"Father?"

243
00:59:37,254 --> 00:59:38,410
"Daddy!"

244
01:00:08,743 --> 01:00:10,070
THE WEIGHT
OF A DAUGHTER...

245
01:00:12,344 --> 01:00:15,417
TOO MUCH FOR
A FATHER WITH NO HANDS.

246
01:00:39,364 --> 01:00:40,448
"Wait..."

247
01:00:42,583 --> 01:00:43,990
"NO!"

248
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:56,248
NEXT SEASON

249
01:01:06,991 --> 01:01:09,072
THE NEW FIXTURE

250
01:01:16,487 --> 01:01:21,356
"Like the French Foreign Legion,
the Museum is a sanctuary...

251
01:01:21,357 --> 01:01:25,792
...in this case, for cowards, for
husbands afraid to face the burdens...

252
01:01:25,793 --> 01:01:31,079
...nay, the terrors... of living
with wives and families.."
