This story is fiction
based on a true story.

00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:19,990
Directed by Yôichi Sai

3
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:30,000
WHERE IS THE MOON?

4
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,670
Company Precept:
"Think and come up with ideas."

5
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,840
"If you can't think,
work till you sweat."

6
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,820
“If you can't think or work,
piss off. <i>“</i>

7
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:10,820
- By Yoichi Kaneda.
- No. Seichi.

8
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,650
Listen.
Take your work seriously.

9
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,180
Yes, sir.

10
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,750
- Throw away your pride.
- Yes.

11
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,890
Let your mind go blank.

12
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:22,900
- Understand?
- Yes.

13
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,760
Hey! Are you new?

14
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,430
I am honoured to join you.

15
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:39,180
My name is Mitsuru Anbo.
Pleased to meet you.

16
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,580
When does the Defence Force
start its New Year?

17
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,990
- Pardon?
- Like yakuza, you know.

18
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,990
They celebrate it
on 13 December.

19
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:57,200
I'm afraid I know little
about gangsters.

20
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,990
Hopeless.

21
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,690
No good.

22
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,350
When I won a gold medal
in the bantam class

23
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:21,360
The guy who I KO'd

24
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:24,760
died four days later
in the hospital.

25
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:28,210
That's when I gave up
on becoming a pro.

26
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:32,360
He tells me in my dreams
I should go for the world.

27
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,890
Then go for the world.

28
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,590
Can you lend me
some money, Chun?

29
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,830
Good morning.

30
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,410
Hachi!

31
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,820
Me not Hachi.
Me Hassan.

32
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:08,600
- Have you taken my money?
- No.

33
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:11,570
I counted and counted.
I'm short.

34
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:16,660
It's unfair of you
to suspect Hassan.

35
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,840
Siding with him, eh?

36
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:21,980
We shouldn't discriminate

37
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,990
against someone
of a different race.

38
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,190
Japan's becoming
a multiracial country...

39
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,200
Did you read that
in your porn magazine?

40
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:36,600
Let's go, Kanda.

41
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,580
Idiot.

42
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,190
Shut up!

43
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:15,000
Give me a cigarette.

44
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:19,440
Watch your manners.

45
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,570
We're just old classmates today.

46
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:29,820
The bride and groom!
Give them a warm welcome.

47
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,830
We're young. North-South
isn't our problem, is it?

48
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,840
- Meaning?
- Was your school near Fuji TV?

49
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:57,680
- The Korean School?
- I often go there for work.

50
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,830
Are you in the industry?

51
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,810
Well... yes.
I suppose I am.

52
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:06,260
- I go to Asia University.
- I'm impressed!

53
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:14,280
Banks won't give the nod
in this climate.

54
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:17,520
Anyway, any profit
goes to the Japanese.

55
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:22,970
Our People's Finance Group
can't <i>even</i> stand on its own.

56
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,860
They'd sell their school...

57
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,650
and pocket the money.

58
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:35,440
Our country can't be united
without mutual understanding.

59
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:41,810
The scent of your hair
turns me on.

60
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:47,840
You're not asking for sex
by any chance, are you?

61
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,820
You're blunt, aren't you?

62
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,190
Did you think you had a chance?

63
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:55,200
I don't think
I'm far off target.

64
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:59,760
Go buy a whore somewhere.
I'll pay.

65
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:06,180
These gentlemen
played baseball together

66
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:09,890
in their days at the Tokyo
Korean High School.

67
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,190
Your attention, please.

68
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,820
In this group behind me

69
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:18,220
there are two bachelors.

70
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,990
That ex-junkman tried
to get into the golf business.

71
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:30,000
But he's got a good business
selling discount skis.

72
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:32,440
You don't understand, Sell.

73
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,990
He wanted status, you see.

74
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:37,970
"The Happiest People Alive"...

75
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:40,940
More applause, please.

76
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,670
The sky is blue,

77
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:55,820
our hearts are gay.

78
00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:00,900
Play your accordions.

79
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:08,310
We are proud of our country

80
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:13,940
where people live in harmony.

81
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:20,580
Our great leader Kim II-Sung...

82
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:23,270
Why only North Korean songs?

83
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:26,190
It's an order from above.

84
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,750
Why not ask our group leader

85
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,600
to sing a song?

86
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,510
There's no time.

87
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:35,900
- You won't let him sing?
- It's not that.

88
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,900
We won't accept this.

89
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:41,060
You're discriminating
against South Korea.

90
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:58,270
His money dried up
after 18 holes.

91
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:02,500
He can barely pay the interest.
30 our boss stepped in.

92
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:06,340
How can Koreans work
with the right-wingers?

93
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:11,600
It's give-and-take.
Money can bend principles.

94
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,200
When we're in trouble,
Japan's behind us.

95
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:18,200
I can only borrow
600-700 million on my land.

96
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:22,180
It's a bargain.
A golf course for 2. 5 billion...

97
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:25,180
This is your chance
to seize destiny.

98
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,670
Destiny...

99
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,410
The boss will take care
of that guy

100
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:33,900
and we'll combine your brains
and our power.

101
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,820
What about the money?

102
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:40,680
Why do you think I'm in finance?

103
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,060
We can't talk on the phone.
Let's sit down.

104
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:52,500
My conviction is that
the couple makes the family,

105
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,510
the family makes the nation

106
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,510
and the nation creates the age.

107
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,260
Let me sing.

108
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:07,400
Come on, let him sing.

109
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,790
But, sir...

110
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,420
Do they teach sex
at the North School?

111
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,900
Don't the students demand it?

112
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,900
I want to be a student.

113
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,670
Go back to primary school.

114
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:40,180
The leader of the Nakaya
South Korean community,

115
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:44,430
Mr Son Chul-Yu,
will sing for the couple.

116
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,350
A famous South Korean song
'Willow Trees along the River...

117
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:52,170
Let's enjoy it.

118
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,830
Hello, Tadao.

119
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:58,520
How's business?

120
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,430
When I ask "How's business?"
you say "It's so-so."

121
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,500
It's so-so.

122
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,190
Good morning.

123
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,580
Good morning, Mama.

124
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,590
Look at this big boy getting
pocket money from his mum.

125
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,980
It's called appreciation,
a Japanese custom.

126
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,990
You Filipinos
wouldn't understand.

127
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,590
Who's that?

128
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:22,580
Connie. Her Japanese is good
so I hired her to assist me.

129
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,740
But she's such a tart!

130
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,680
Bye.

131
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,590
Sorry, I won again.

132
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:41,600
I've won more than I want.

133
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:59,200
Your luck's run out.

134
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,190
Look, I've got the whole lot!

135
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:09,350
- You plucked my last feather.
- Grow it back.

136
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,680
Can you grow it back?

137
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:41,680
Hello. Kaneda Taxis.

138
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:43,600
Oh, it's you.

139
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,710
Where am I, sir?

140
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:52,700
Mr Anbo, where is the moon?

141
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,200
It's in the east...

142
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,980
or in the west...

143
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,350
or the south...
or maybe the north.

144
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:09,900
Mr Anbo, just drive
towards the moon.

145
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:34,170
Good evening.

146
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,590
- Why aren't you up?
- I have a headache.

147
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,270
- Don't use my futon.
- Mine's dirty.

148
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:50,990
You bastard.

149
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:01,900
- Doesn't that hurt your eye?
- My head's pounding.

150
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:05,180
When I dream,

151
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:09,660
I feel so sad
that I can't move my body.

152
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:13,990
I don't know why.
Do you, Chun?

153
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:17,320
Stop complaining
and go to hospital.

154
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,980
You know I've no money.

155
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,430
And it makes no difference
where I am.

156
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,430
- I'm tired of hearing that.
- Chun...

157
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,430
Give me a cigarette.

158
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,590
I like you, Chun.

159
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:44,180
But I hate Koreans.

160
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,190
I'm tired of that too.

161
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:52,190
Koreans are cunning,
dirty and uncultured.

162
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:55,180
You're just like
a Korean yourself.

163
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,190
No way!

164
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,590
I'm pure Japanese.

165
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,500
- Chun...
- What?

166
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:05,820
Can you lend me <i>some</i> money?

167
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:38,680
I'm the madam's son.

168
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:44,170
- <i>How's</i> business?
- It's so-so.

169
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,990
Be quiet!

170
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,180
Sir...

171
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,590
Just between you and me,
this place is a rip-off.

172
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:15,170
You know, Connie...

173
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,670
my heart is full of sadness.

174
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:24,000
I want someone...

175
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,910
to heal my heart.

176
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,490
Do you want a drink?

177
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:39,600
Sol drown my loneliness
in drink again.

178
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:03,570
By the end of the month?
Well, I'm not sure.

179
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:06,200
Do they need cash?

180
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:09,650
I check the tachograph
every day.

181
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:11,410
It can't be wrong.

182
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:14,180
Anyone can make a mistake.

183
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,190
I don't make
three mistakes in a row.

184
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:18,560
Never mind.

185
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:21,560
I know it's a chance
for a bargain.

186
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,180
Listen, Mr Ono.

187
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:28,000
Why do tachographs record
time, distance and speed?

188
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,570
For the safety of the drivers.

189
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:34,180
If they're not
overworked or driving too fast...

190
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:38,420
If they're not being lazy
or embezzling the takings...

191
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:50,690
In other words, tachographs
are there to tie us down.

192
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,980
Hey, lend me some money?

193
00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:00,180
Don't, Anbo. You'd be
throwing it down the drain.

194
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,570
I'll repay it straight away.

195
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:05,570
- Aren't you ashamed?
- Of what?

196
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:10,420
- Of sponging off a junior.
- Don't talk, you crook.

197
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:13,430
I work harder than you.

198
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,580
You always cause trouble.

199
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,980
Don't talk, you drain.

200
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,180
I'm not a drain.

201
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:26,420
Are you picking a fight?

202
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:30,260
Will you two quarrel outside?

203
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:34,010
Excuse me, sirs.

204
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,670
Your hair's a mess.
Work hard, all right?

205
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,810
The Korean School spirit, eh?

206
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:50,180
You know I trust you.

207
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,800
Bye.

208
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:57,180
Will you at least
work your quota?

209
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:01,590
200 km a day is nothing
compared to other companies.

210
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:04,600
Moving 100 million yen
with one phone call

211
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:08,440
isn't like making 400,000 yen
driving a taxi.

212
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:09,930
Chun...

213
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:14,440
A taxi driver
earns from mileage.

214
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,670
Stop whining and do your job.

215
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:26,420
Run, Hoso,
or you'll be in trouble.

216
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,340
How's this, sir'?
Happy now?

217
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,420
Irene...

218
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:35,980
When you finish with clients,
you must come back at once.

219
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:38,440
Translate, Connie.

220
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:40,840
Irene, pull your socks up.

221
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:42,840
Use your brains.

222
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:47,600
You're in Japan,
so adapt to Japanese ways.

223
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:49,180
Translate.

224
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:53,390
Follow their system.

225
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,420
Why? I'm a Filipina.

226
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:58,500
Not a bow-legged Jap.

227
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,430
Lolita...

228
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,220
Don't waste your time chatting.
Make sure you offer drinks.

229
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,670
Japanese men will always
order drinks if you ask.

230
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,430
Japan is a country of gentlemen.

231
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:18,760
We make our money on drinks.

232
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:23,060
The more we make,
the more your salary goes up.

233
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:26,440
Money is everything.
Understand?

234
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,070
Translate, Connie.

235
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:33,200
I'm not an interpreter, Mama.

236
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:37,190
Money buys a house back home
and makes your family happy.

237
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:39,000
Well, Connie?

238
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:43,360
So don't make a fuss
if a client touches you.

239
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:48,180
I get paid for singing songs
and pouring drinks

240
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,980
but I don't get paid
for anything else.

241
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:54,740
Who do you think
made you a manageress?

242
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,980
I don't have to sell my body
like others do.

243
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:00,180
I came to Japan when I was 15.

244
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:05,190
I came to Japan when I was 10!
You can't fool me.

245
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:11,180
Don't you think
you should open the hen?

246
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:14,350
While you're lecturing us
you're losing customers.

247
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:19,330
I've gone through everything
you've gone through.

248
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:22,810
You should look up to me
as a role model.

249
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:26,000
If you do as I say,
you'll never go wrong.

250
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,970
Translate, Connie.

251
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:33,600
She made lots of mistakes.

252
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,630
That's how she learned.

253
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:47,650
I think in Japan people like you

254
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,900
aren't treated fairly.

255
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,190
You're discriminated against.

256
00:25:56,390 --> 00:26:00,050
I think I can understand you
very well.

257
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,430
- Are you coming on to me?
- No, Connie.

258
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:09,490
I'm a very serious man...
so serious as to be idiotic.

259
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,980
Idiotic?

260
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:15,180
- Pure.
- Pure?

261
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:18,570
Pure, eh?

262
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,590
A long time ago,
there was a big war.

263
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:27,990
People of my country
were enslaved like cattle.

264
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:30,840
My mother, like you now,

265
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:34,520
<i>came</i> to Japan to earn
a living for the family.

266
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,430
She crossed the wild seas...

267
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,650
Did she swim?

268
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,650
In a boat.

269
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,270
I don't know how she was
before, but now she's rich.

270
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,190
She's gone through a lot.

271
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:54,190
My father was killed
by the Japanese Army

272
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:56,360
and all my brothers died.

273
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,190
How?

274
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,060
From malnutrition.

275
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,000
Only I survived.

276
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:13,430
My mother worked like a dog.

277
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:16,440
As for <i>me...</i>

278
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:20,910
I had to spend my nights
alone at home.

279
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:29,920
It's embarrassing for a man
of over 30 to say this...

280
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:33,000
but I'm starving for love.

281
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:04,060
Good night.

282
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,830
Connie...

283
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:09,440
What?

284
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:14,440
Platonic love is lonely,
isn't it?

285
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:19,280
I only screw men I love.

286
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:21,760
Be honest with yourself.

287
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,900
Does being honest mean
I have to screw you?

288
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:32,650
I love you, Connie.

289
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,910
I love you.

290
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:42,680
I love you.

291
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:28,170
I felt your tongue.

292
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:31,190
Oh, well... why not?

293
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:44,660
What?

294
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:46,200
A kiss.

295
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:52,730
Come off it.

296
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:56,900
One night, that was all.

297
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:16,500
- Shit! I forgot something.
- We're already late.

298
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,300
Give me the key.

299
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,180
Welcome home.

300
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:53,990
I've run you a bath.

301
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,360
What's this?

302
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:04,580
My stuff.
I'm unpacking it.

303
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,250
Get out!

304
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:11,440
Go and have a bath,
then we'll talk.

305
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:15,420
- Talk about what?
- Don't get mad.

306
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,430
- I'll call the police.
- What will you say?

307
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,820
"Do you know him?"
"He's my boss's son."

308
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:27,830
"Have you lost anything?"
"I have more stuff now."

309
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:32,650
Stop this nonsense.

310
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:35,660
Connie...

311
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:38,990
Why are you doing this?

312
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:41,760
I need you.

313
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,190
Connie...

314
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,820
I don't need you.

315
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,210
Have a bath while it's hot.

316
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:52,980
It's my bath!

317
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:58,340
The pitcher's first ball...

318
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:01,680
The batter hits it. It's big...

319
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:04,290
Big...

320
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:06,200
Connie!

321
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:08,080
Look, Connie.

322
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,670
It's big...

323
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,170
- Hello.
- Good morning!

324
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:19,570
God be with me.

325
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:47,800
Hello.

326
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,060
Yes, that's right.

327
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:53,990
- Chun's there, isn't he?
- Chun?

328
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:56,980
Tadao Kanda.
You know, Chun for short.

329
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,980
- Hello.
- It's me.

330
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:08,990
- Hello, Hoso.
- I always wanted to ask...

331
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,590
Why are you Korean?

332
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,740
Why is your Japanese
better than mine?

333
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:17,970
Hoso, this isn't
a kids' counselling service.

334
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:24,690
Pervert.

335
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,900
- Hello.
- Is Chun there?

336
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,880
What?

337
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:59,920
I don't like Koreans,
but I like you.

338
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,910
- So?
- Lend me some money.

339
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,570
Connie, darling...

340
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:33,180
Get me Chun.

341
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,000
For you.

342
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:44,410
- What do you want?
- Don't leave me!

343
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:47,820
- Are you stupid?
- I told you I like you.

344
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,740
How many times
do I have to tell you?

345
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:52,000
Hoso...

346
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:54,420
Don't call me again.

347
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:57,420
Connie...

348
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:59,430
The fire's out.

349
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:33,900
Stop this shit, Hoso!

350
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:36,600
Tadao?

351
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:41,190
What are you doing there, Tadao?

352
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:55,000
- Is Sell in?
- Mr Arai...

353
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:05,680
- Kang Su...
- Hello.

354
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:07,980
Chun Nam.

355
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:20,510
Hey... won't you work for me?
I'll pay you a good salary.

356
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:22,830
I don't like money-lenders.

357
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:27,990
We Koreans in Japan...

358
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,190
have to make money
for as long as we're here.

359
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:36,920
We must all get stronger
and pull together.

360
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:39,180
Don't lecture me.

361
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:43,600
Koreans just don't have
a spirit of self-sacrifice.

362
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:48,310
What I want is to use
the money I make from lending

363
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:51,150
for the unification of Korea.

364
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:56,840
The money I make belongs
not to me but to society.

365
00:38:57,030 --> 00:39:00,700
Koreans only think about
themselves and their relatives.

366
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:04,410
That's the bad side
of capitalism.

367
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:09,580
To end our people's tragedy
and build a unified nation

368
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:14,440
I'm prepared to lose
all my money. Believe me!

369
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:18,680
So says the guy
who got VD from a whore.

370
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,670
"“Oh, my dick hurts..."

371
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:25,180
You betrayer of the nation.

372
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,430
After the golf course,
I'd like a hotel.

373
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,900
To accommodate 2000 people.

374
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:43,180
It's good to plan ahead.

375
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:47,200
That old fool couldn't see
beyond a pinball parlour.

376
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:51,600
We're a new generation of
Korean businessmen in Japan.

377
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:55,580
We're the children of capitalism.
Damn unification!

378
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:58,180
- Mr Arai...
- I'm sorry.

379
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:00,180
That was a private matter.

380
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:04,350
When you deal with Mr Konno,
talk to me first, okay?

381
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:06,600
I know.

382
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:10,600
I ask for your generous
assistance.

383
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:16,200
Let's have a meal
with our president again.

384
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:19,090
We learn so much
from him, you know.

385
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:27,830
Hey! Wake up.

386
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:32,900
To Ikebukuro.

387
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:36,620
Come on, wake up.

388
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:39,570
Open the door, you bastard.

389
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:43,590
- I want to fuck her.
- It's not for hire. No.

390
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:47,590
No...

391
00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:00,410
Go on, get him. Kick him!

392
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:10,810
I don't like scolding.
It's not my style.

393
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:15,190
But how can a taxi driver
raise his hand to customers?

394
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,350
Some customers they were.

395
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:20,200
They're demanding compensation.

396
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:22,830
They stink, you know.

397
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:27,360
The authorities will come down
on us if we refuse customers.

398
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:31,180
You can't drive a taxi
and be scared of the authorities.

399
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:34,970
Don't you know that drivers
can't argue back?

400
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,900
They provoked me.

401
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:38,600
Osamu...

402
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,430
If you hit them, you lose.

403
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:47,190
Endure all the blows,
and you'll win.

404
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:50,170
They were savages.

405
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:52,190
Don't be racist.

406
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:54,590
Say "white native
South Americans".

407
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:56,720
Savages are savages.

408
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:04,910
Hello. Kaneda Taxis.

409
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:08,900
It's Anbo here, sir.
Where am I?

410
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:12,440
What do you see
around you, Mr Anbo?

411
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:22,200
I see a golden object
that looks like a turd.

412
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:29,590
Turn right at the turd
and drive straight.

413
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,900
You can all bloody well...

414
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,580
Good morning.

415
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:39,570
What's happened?

416
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:43,840
My wife's run away.

417
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:48,590
Mr Senba,
I'm taking a few days off.

418
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,740
What are you saying?

419
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:07,180
- Who is it?
- It's me.

420
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,190
I know Chun's there.

421
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,030
He's mad.

422
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:16,170
Let me in, Chun.

423
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:18,410
I'm not here.

424
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:23,740
- He's not here.
- Liar! I saw him go in.

425
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:34,170
- The neighbours will be angry.
- He'll give up.

426
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:38,090
Let me in, Chun!

427
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:58,160
- Who are you?
- Shut up!

428
00:43:58,370 --> 00:44:01,840
What have you got to do
with my man?

429
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:05,100
I look after Chun.

430
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:10,910
- Chun!
- What do you want?

431
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:14,930
- Are you jealous?
- You're a lunatic.

432
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:19,700
I came to see Chun.
You get out of my way.

433
00:44:26,290 --> 00:44:29,240
Hello.
Go home, will you?

434
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:33,320
Are you angry with me, Chun?

435
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:38,690
I don't like Koreans...

436
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:41,330
but I like you.

437
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:47,070
Hoso...

438
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:54,100
Tell him to go home.

439
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,340
He's not a bad guy.

440
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:59,680
- Shall I kick you both out?
- Go home!

441
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:02,490
I slept in Chun's bed.

442
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:06,570
What are you saying, you idiot?

443
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:09,780
We're tied together
by a strong friendship.

444
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,910
Don't worry, Connie.

445
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:13,410
Get out!

446
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:16,930
What's your name?

447
00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:22,320
You're dark, aren't you?

448
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:49,090
Mum...

449
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:52,920
Stop sulking.
You're like a child.

450
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:02,700
I borrowed this video for you.

451
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:10,460
I always think of you
more than anyone else.

452
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:15,000
Whenever you're being sweet,
there's always something...

453
00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:20,000
- Shall we pack the video too?
- Don't be stupid.

454
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:22,910
I'd gladly send you to the North.

455
00:46:23,810 --> 00:46:25,680
How are my brothers?

456
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:28,340
Some brother you are!

457
00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:32,920
I think I want to live
in a warm climate.

458
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:38,020
Could you face your brothers
without shame?

459
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,090
Yes.

460
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:52,160
You can have fun with Connie.

461
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:56,250
But if you tell me
you want to marry her

462
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,670
I'll disown you.

463
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:05,340
No Japanese girls...

464
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:09,930
no Filipinas...

465
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:12,470
no Cheju Islanders...

466
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:14,480
no Southern girls...

467
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:17,410
Who can I marry, then?

468
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:22,100
Heaven help me!

469
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:57,090
Done.

470
00:47:58,370 --> 00:47:59,840
Pack them.

471
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:12,410
People's Democratic Republic
of Korea

472
00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:21,940
in the light of factors
of an economic nature

473
00:48:22,930 --> 00:48:25,760
or a political nature

474
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:27,810
or the benefits provided

475
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:31,110
By the Japanese economy.

476
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:35,770
But at the moment

477
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:38,800
many of these conditions

478
00:48:39,010 --> 00:48:41,240
can hardly be improved upon.

479
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:46,020
And yet we can see
so much hardship.

480
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:50,170
And in these circumstances

481
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:55,670
it's very hard to maintain
our faith in religion.

482
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,990
I wonder how people see us.

483
00:49:34,230 --> 00:49:36,500
Two young lovers.

484
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:42,920
- You'd be the pimp.
- Are you picking a fight?

485
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:45,930
I have an eye for men.

486
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:49,700
- I do love you.
- You're so shameless!

487
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:51,420
I love you.

488
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:55,070
- How do you know that?
- I'm learning.

489
00:49:55,290 --> 00:49:56,640
What else?

490
00:49:57,090 --> 00:49:59,000
Let's fuck.

491
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:03,090
You'll be punished one day.

492
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,480
Let's go to hell together.

493
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:11,690
Get out.

494
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:13,260
Come on, get out.

495
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:19,930
Show me your ID and licence.

496
00:50:38,530 --> 00:50:40,240
He broke my tooth!

497
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:01,830
Quick, the handcuffs!

498
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:05,850
See how he returned my kindness?

499
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:08,400
There are plenty
of other Iranians.

500
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:09,900
I agree, sir.

501
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:12,420
Out with all rogue foreigners!

502
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:17,100
- I agree, sir.
- They should go home.

503
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:18,690
I agree...

504
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:24,390
Excuse me, sir.

505
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:29,840
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but the bank rang.

506
00:51:30,050 --> 00:51:34,160
Mr Arai has passed a dud cheque
and gone on the run.

507
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:40,670
The bloody idiot!

508
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:05,930
Where's our pay?

509
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:12,010
I'm going to quit.

510
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:15,170
For my little angel's sake,
I'll quit driving.

511
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:27,080
Our president is trying hard
to raise <i>some</i> money.

512
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:30,690
I won't work until you pay me.

513
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:33,090
I won't work for nothing.

514
00:52:33,310 --> 00:52:35,700
I'll quit... definitely.

515
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:38,070
We will pay you.

516
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:40,930
By the way...

517
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:45,330
What happened
to our recreation trip?

518
00:52:50,730 --> 00:52:52,680
Haven't we saved for it?

519
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:54,920
We're hard up now.

520
00:52:55,600 --> 00:53:01,310
We're supposed to have
lots of fun with geisha girls.

521
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:04,690
That's right. I remember.

522
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:10,090
Can't we still go,
and make it Tada's farewell?

523
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:12,070
Sure. Let's go.

524
00:54:11,910 --> 00:54:14,940
Here are the keys
to your cars, sir.

525
00:54:15,150 --> 00:54:16,250
Fine.

526
00:54:19,450 --> 00:54:23,400
305,000 yen received, sir.
Please wait.

527
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:33,240
How was the spa?
Was it good?

528
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:37,330
The geisha girls were so old
we got a shock.

529
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:39,480
The bill shows you had fun.

530
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:42,490
I wouldn't mind staying
another night.

531
00:54:45,310 --> 00:54:47,700
Now that you've had your fun,

532
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:52,180
we must help each other
to get through this crisis.

533
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:56,930
Can we stop for some milk
on the way?

534
00:54:58,990 --> 00:55:00,020
Hey!

535
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:03,410
Aren't you aware of the state
our company is in?

536
00:55:03,730 --> 00:55:06,150
It's been a good trip,
hasn't it?

537
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:08,690
We'll be back!

538
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,150
Thanks a lot.

539
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:16,080
We Koreans
should help each other.

540
00:55:16,310 --> 00:55:19,700
What for?
I'm only your employee.

541
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:25,690
You're all fired!

542
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:55,060
Now is the time
for us to work together

543
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:58,830
across national
and racial borders.

544
00:55:59,050 --> 00:56:03,000
We must look to the future
and work as hard as we can.

545
00:56:03,190 --> 00:56:04,820
Effort in business!

546
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:08,100
Only effort in business
will save the world.

547
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:11,350
We're like a family.

548
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:16,270
Think of me as your real
mother and work harder.

549
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:20,790
But we're only
humble guest workers.

550
00:56:21,410 --> 00:56:24,510
That's what's wrong
with South-East Asian women.

551
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:29,180
Filipino, Thai, Malaysian,
Taiwanese, Chinese...

552
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:31,800
Chinese are the least
trustworthy.

553
00:56:32,250 --> 00:56:34,930
Isn't Korea in South-East Asia?

554
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:37,200
It's in East Asia!

555
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:40,190
Oh well, too bad...

556
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:45,440
Why don't the two of us
pool our efforts tonight?

557
00:56:45,630 --> 00:56:51,580
Mama too can devote herself
to saving the world.

558
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:55,670
Whether you're on a short date
or an overnight stay

559
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:57,660
I'll keep shop for you.

560
00:56:58,110 --> 00:57:00,900
Don't you know
how hard I work for you?

561
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:05,180
Stop it, Mother.
You're an embarrassment

562
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:06,740
So what?

563
00:57:06,950 --> 00:57:09,420
The reason I have
this place and all

564
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:13,170
is because I've done
embarrassing things.

565
00:57:13,390 --> 00:57:15,070
I can see that, <i>Mama.</i>

566
00:57:15,290 --> 00:57:18,080
Shut up! You've brought
nothing but trouble.

567
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:22,420
- Don't blame me.
- It's not her fault, Mother.

568
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:26,830
Don't you ever sympathise
with your poor mother?

569
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:29,750
You should be on my side.

570
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:32,410
Come on, cut it out.

571
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:35,650
Why shouldn't I rely
on my own son?

572
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:08,820
You know, I'm going to quit
that rotten company.

573
00:58:09,050 --> 00:58:12,760
I want to become
an independent cab driver.

574
00:58:12,950 --> 00:58:16,180
You got a ticket for speeding
the other day.

575
00:58:16,390 --> 00:58:19,420
You have to have
a clean record for 10 years.

576
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:23,490
- Have I ever had an accident?
- I'm talking about offences.

577
00:58:23,730 --> 00:58:27,280
I can become independent
any time I like.

578
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:31,570
And...

579
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:36,750
I'll bring my mother out
from Niigata. My son, too.

580
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:39,730
I'll start a new life
with my ex-wife.

581
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:44,830
- You should quit driving taxis.
- I'll build a house.

582
00:58:45,550 --> 00:58:47,500
I'll get my family together.

583
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:52,990
My ex-wife's working
at a club in Ginza.

584
00:58:53,190 --> 00:58:55,340
She rang me the other day

585
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:58,590
and said she wanted
to come back to me.

586
00:58:59,970 --> 00:59:03,600
- Where did she ring you?
- In my apartment.

587
00:59:06,410 --> 00:59:10,350
Will you lend me money, Chun?
Let's go and see her.

588
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:26,990
- Where's the club?
- Somewhere around here.

589
00:59:30,330 --> 00:59:33,990
Perhaps I got it wrong.

590
00:59:35,730 --> 00:59:39,440
It may be in Tachikawa,
not Ginza.

591
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:43,270
<i>How can you mix up Gina</i>

592
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:45,580
They're similar, aren't they?

593
00:59:59,330 --> 01:00:00,430
Hoso...

594
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:02,170
Slow down.

595
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:06,060
Don't worry. I can easily
handle 100 or 200 kph.

596
01:00:06,270 --> 01:00:08,810
I know your left eye
is rather weak.

597
01:00:09,030 --> 01:00:11,340
And so is my right ear.

598
01:00:11,570 --> 01:00:13,600
My head is aching badly.

599
01:00:13,970 --> 01:00:16,200
It feels like
it's burning inside.

600
01:00:16,710 --> 01:00:21,660
I'll do it, damn it.
I'll stake my life.

601
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:25,990
Why should I be knocked down?
I'll knock him down.

602
01:00:26,190 --> 01:00:28,570
Damn it...

603
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:36,200
Let's go home. We both have
to work tomorrow.

604
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:40,420
You think I'm telling you
a lie, don't you?

605
01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:44,900
- That's not true.
- Yes. You think I'm lying.

606
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:48,430
You look down on me.

607
01:00:48,970 --> 01:00:51,200
I don't like that.

608
01:00:52,310 --> 01:00:54,260
Let's cool ourselves down.

609
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:57,190
I don't like Koreans
looking down on me.

610
01:00:57,950 --> 01:01:00,290
- Let's go home.
- Shut up!

611
01:01:04,890 --> 01:01:07,840
I'm going to see my ex-wife.

612
01:01:08,030 --> 01:01:10,180
She rang me.

613
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,420
You don't have a phone.

614
01:01:12,630 --> 01:01:15,740
She wanted to see me.
She was crying.

615
01:01:15,970 --> 01:01:18,070
She wants our family together.

616
01:01:18,270 --> 01:01:20,060
I understand.

617
01:01:31,650 --> 01:01:33,200
Get out.

618
01:02:13,890 --> 01:02:16,840
I hate Koreans.

619
01:03:22,490 --> 01:03:23,930
Yes.

620
01:03:25,060 --> 01:03:27,010
Thank you very much, sir.

621
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:31,360
- Any radio message yet?
- They're trying to call him.

622
01:03:31,570 --> 01:03:35,200
Wouldn't it be quicker
to call the police?

623
01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:42,430
Body temperature...

624
01:03:42,950 --> 01:03:45,450
Someone's life is at risk,
you know.

625
01:03:46,050 --> 01:03:47,680
Same here.

626
01:03:47,890 --> 01:03:50,280
He may have been killed.

627
01:03:51,390 --> 01:03:56,180
He's stupid.
He should at least contact us.

628
01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:00,590
He couldn't call us
from the bottom of a dam.

629
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:03,590
Are you enjoying this?

630
01:04:04,570 --> 01:04:06,080
I'm worried.

631
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:10,510
- He may be asleep.
- Then someone would see him!

632
01:04:11,110 --> 01:04:13,340
Please don't shout.

633
01:04:13,550 --> 01:04:16,570
What if my angel has a fit?

634
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:24,590
Weren't you going to quit
for your angel's sake?

635
01:04:24,790 --> 01:04:27,580
I'm here until I find
another job.

636
01:04:29,730 --> 01:04:32,680
You were with him last,
weren't you?

637
01:04:35,970 --> 01:04:38,200
I'll report it to the police.

638
01:04:38,970 --> 01:04:40,920
I can't take responsibility.

639
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:45,900
Who cares about responsibility
now in this company?

640
01:04:49,950 --> 01:04:52,260
Hello. Kaneda Taxis.

641
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:55,190
This is Anbo, sir.
Where am I...

642
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:55,680
Look, Connie.

643
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:57,990
It's a little far from here...

644
01:05:58,950 --> 01:06:00,660
Make it strong.

645
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:04,190
But it's a very nice club.

646
01:06:04,390 --> 01:06:06,340
How far is it?

647
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:10,350
- Shiojiri in Nagano.
- Nagano?

648
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:12,190
My friend owns it.

649
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:15,950
I told him about you
and he's very keen.

650
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:19,650
Eat some, Tadao,
before it dries up.

651
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:24,590
The manager's young
and energetic.

652
01:06:25,110 --> 01:06:27,420
I left the tuna belly for you.

653
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:30,510
You can see snow there.

654
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:32,660
Cut it out.

655
01:06:32,890 --> 01:06:37,040
I don't want to see snow.
Filipinos hate snow.

656
01:06:37,220 --> 01:06:39,570
Are you so keen to separate us?

657
01:06:39,790 --> 01:06:42,180
You don't have to take the job.

658
01:06:42,390 --> 01:06:46,580
Enough is enough. Let's go
to the Philippines, Tadao.

659
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:48,430
What's this about?

660
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:52,980
We're going to live together
in the Philippines.

661
01:06:53,210 --> 01:06:56,990
He wouldn't go
and leave me behind.

662
01:06:57,210 --> 01:07:00,520
He said he was sick of you.

663
01:07:00,710 --> 01:07:04,740
There's a Japanese saying,
"Blood is thicker than water."

664
01:07:04,950 --> 01:07:07,340
Isn't it
"Money's thicker than water"?

665
01:07:07,550 --> 01:07:09,070
Don't, Connie.

666
01:07:09,290 --> 01:07:13,920
Tadao, you have to choose.
Me or this old bitch.

667
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:17,970
You little tart!
Go back to the Philippines.

668
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:53,980
- Does it hurt?
- I'm not a nut case.

669
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:56,430
I've got a headache, that's all.

670
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:02,590
The cops are threatening
to send me to the hospital.

671
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:06,590
They say I might not come out.

672
01:08:07,410 --> 01:08:13,000
I just wanted to see Mother.
I didn't know she was dead.

673
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:15,970
It was my fault
that I didn't know

674
01:08:16,190 --> 01:08:19,420
but I wanted to see her,
that's all.

675
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:24,990
I'm not a lunatic, am I, Chun?

676
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:27,830
No.

677
01:08:28,030 --> 01:08:30,820
You won't put me
in the hospital, will you?

678
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:34,190
I couldn't put you
in the hospital.

679
01:08:34,470 --> 01:08:36,180
So don't worry.

680
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:41,990
I like you,
though I don't like Koreans.

681
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:43,770
I know.

682
01:08:43,950 --> 01:08:45,740
You'll come to see me again?

683
01:08:45,950 --> 01:08:48,980
Yes. I'll <i>come</i> again.

684
01:08:52,490 --> 01:08:57,000
I'm a poor man. It makes
no difference where I live.

685
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:05,840
Chun...

686
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:08,190
Can you lend me some money?

687
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:23,590
You have some forms to fill in.

688
01:10:39,660 --> 01:10:41,370
Where are you going?

689
01:10:42,330 --> 01:10:43,800
Cigarettes.

690
01:10:44,670 --> 01:10:46,620
In the drawer.

691
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:50,190
So we still have some...

692
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:52,380
Here they are.

693
01:10:54,310 --> 01:10:58,020
- I want some beer.
- Shall I go and buy some?

694
01:10:59,450 --> 01:11:01,400
It's in the fridge.

695
01:11:14,530 --> 01:11:16,210
What's that for?

696
01:11:16,430 --> 01:11:19,380
You're really disgusting.

697
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:21,390
What have I done?

698
01:11:21,610 --> 01:11:24,470
Lies, lies!
Always telling lies.

699
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:27,020
Have I lied to you?

700
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:30,870
Your father was killed
by the Japanese

701
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:33,630
and your brothers died
of malnutrition?

702
01:11:33,850 --> 01:11:35,560
What a story!

703
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:38,780
There were people like that.

704
01:11:46,330 --> 01:11:47,800
Stop it!

705
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:52,030
Stop it, Connie.
Don't waste food.

706
01:11:54,510 --> 01:11:58,370
You'll never find a woman
as lovable as me.

707
01:11:58,610 --> 01:12:00,400
You're so modest.

708
01:12:00,610 --> 01:12:03,880
- I wish you'd drop dead!
- Life's hard enough.

709
01:12:05,250 --> 01:12:06,800
Bastard!

710
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:09,870
Stop it.

711
01:12:10,090 --> 01:12:11,400
Idiot!

712
01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:16,370
- You sex maniac.
- Suck her sagging tits!

713
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:31,930
After all I've done for you!

714
01:12:34,150 --> 01:12:38,380
- When did you do what?
- I worried so much over you.

715
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:48,270
- Come to the Philippines.
- No, I won't.

716
01:12:48,930 --> 01:12:53,880
- Don't come, then.
- I said I won't.

717
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:56,030
Come!

718
01:13:04,910 --> 01:13:07,170
I've had enough of you.

719
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:18,030
Come to the Philippines!

720
01:13:51,420 --> 01:13:53,850
Hey, I know that character.

721
01:13:54,530 --> 01:13:56,390
It's in the word "ginger".

722
01:13:57,100 --> 01:13:59,800
Is your name pronounced "Ga"?

723
01:14:00,330 --> 01:14:02,040
It's Kang, sir.

724
01:14:02,930 --> 01:14:06,400
- Are you from China?
- I'm Korean.

725
01:14:06,910 --> 01:14:10,850
So, you're a South Korean
immigrant in Japan, right?

726
01:14:12,140 --> 01:14:15,090
I have lots of Korean friends
like you.

727
01:14:15,310 --> 01:14:17,100
They live in a ghetto...

728
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:22,870
A place where there are
many Korean immigrants.

729
01:14:23,090 --> 01:14:25,190
I can't remember
my friend's name.

730
01:14:25,390 --> 01:14:28,780
- Isn't he Mr Kim?
- Like the one on TV?

731
01:14:29,830 --> 01:14:31,930
I visited him once.

732
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:35,190
Their apple tasted
like their pickles.

733
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:38,110
Everything they had
smelt of pickles.

734
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:40,170
Do you still hate our pickles?

735
01:14:40,410 --> 01:14:42,190
I absolutely love them.

736
01:14:42,410 --> 01:14:47,200
I buy jars of them. I'm fussy
about Korean barbecue.

737
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:53,390
Their grandmother kept
talking to us in Korean

738
01:14:53,590 --> 01:14:57,250
but my poor friend
couldn't speak the language.

739
01:14:57,490 --> 01:15:01,560
She should speak in Japanese
if she's in Japan.

740
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:04,390
- Do you think so, too?
- Of course.

741
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:05,780
You know...

742
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,790
the Korean comfort women issue
is a bit odd, isn't it?

743
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,190
"What's the
“comfort women" issue?

744
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:17,190
Weren't they prostitutes?
And it was during the war.

745
01:15:17,410 --> 01:15:21,200
It was before we were born.
We don't care, do we?

746
01:15:21,410 --> 01:15:23,800
I was born after the war, too.

747
01:15:23,980 --> 01:15:27,170
But we say
"after the liberation".

748
01:15:27,390 --> 01:15:31,170
I've been following
Korean issues.

749
01:15:31,390 --> 01:15:36,180
That riot in I. was incredible.
They just shoot, don't they?

750
01:15:36,390 --> 01:15:38,540
It's scary, isn't it?

751
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:41,710
You know what they call
“Korean power“...

752
01:15:41,930 --> 01:15:44,560
I wish I had
some of their power.

753
01:15:44,770 --> 01:15:46,240
Me too.

754
01:15:46,910 --> 01:15:49,170
Maybe I should go to Seoul.

755
01:15:49,410 --> 01:15:53,800
I'd like to come with you.
You could show me around.

756
01:16:16,670 --> 01:16:20,170
Oh... I'm short of money.

757
01:16:20,410 --> 01:16:22,190
Would you mind waiting?

758
01:16:22,510 --> 01:16:24,180
It's just there.

759
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:30,390
I won't be long.

760
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:39,030
I'll be back.

761
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,390
Police!

762
01:18:34,910 --> 01:18:37,850
You bastard!
I'll call the police!

763
01:18:42,510 --> 01:18:45,190
I'm sorry. Forgive me.

764
01:18:45,380 --> 01:18:47,770
Don't hit me, Mr Ga!

765
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:52,020
- Kang is my name.
- I won't do it again, Mr Ga!

766
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:06,610
I said my name was Kang.

767
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:10,390
I'm sorry, Mr Kang.

768
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:15,790
- Pay your fare.
- Yes!

769
01:19:19,250 --> 01:19:22,040
- It was a joke.
- The money!

770
01:19:22,250 --> 01:19:24,200
I really didn't mean it.

771
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:47,180
Your change of 1390 yen, sir.

772
01:19:56,690 --> 01:19:59,400
Thank you very much, sir.

773
01:20:14,510 --> 01:20:16,450
At the present moment

774
01:20:16,670 --> 01:20:20,340
many of us cannot escape

775
01:20:21,050 --> 01:20:23,510
from our own beliefs.

776
01:20:25,150 --> 01:20:27,100
There are times

777
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:29,260
when we see the ills

778
01:20:29,490 --> 01:20:31,560
in God's world

779
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:35,070
and want to change direction...

780
01:21:08,430 --> 01:21:09,610
Connie...

781
01:21:11,530 --> 01:21:13,400
I'm sorry.

782
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,790
I'm sorry I hit you.

783
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:26,780
Not now.

784
01:21:27,910 --> 01:21:32,020
I want to say this to you
before God.

785
01:21:33,450 --> 01:21:35,640
Can't you be quiet?

786
01:21:38,090 --> 01:21:41,200
I love you, Connie.

787
01:21:41,530 --> 01:21:43,200
Go to hell.

788
01:22:03,610 --> 01:22:07,560
The sunset over Manila Bay
viewed from Rizal Park...

789
01:22:08,690 --> 01:22:11,110
must be very beautiful.

790
01:22:16,690 --> 01:22:19,400
Will you run
a karaoke bar for me?

791
01:22:24,070 --> 01:22:28,180
Then...
we'll build a house...

792
01:22:30,510 --> 01:22:32,450
and live with my family.

793
01:22:39,320 --> 01:22:43,270
Will you live in the Philippines
until you die?

794
01:22:48,590 --> 01:22:50,380
Your lies...

795
01:22:53,160 --> 01:22:55,790
have affected me a bit
this time.

796
01:22:56,430 --> 01:22:58,380
I'm not lying.

797
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:01,780
I can't take it any more.

798
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:08,200
I love you, Connie.

799
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:16,630
I'm sick and tired
of hearing that.

800
01:23:45,980 --> 01:23:51,090
There's nothing we can do.
We can't escape.

801
01:23:51,690 --> 01:23:55,640
They won't kill us
but we'll be their slaves.

802
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:01,790
But times will change for us.

803
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,790
After all, capitalism
is all about money.

804
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,390
Until then,

805
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:10,630
imagine you're in the North
and work hard.

806
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:14,030
What happened
to our Japanese support?

807
01:24:15,680 --> 01:24:17,710
We've been betrayed.

808
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:21,020
I didn't realise
they were so racist.

809
01:24:21,250 --> 01:24:23,400
I did try hard, though.

810
01:24:23,750 --> 01:24:26,700
You played a dirty trick on me!

811
01:24:28,930 --> 01:24:30,950
Just pretend you're dead.

812
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:33,950
Why should I clean up your mess?

813
01:24:34,330 --> 01:24:37,200
Let's talk quietly, Mr Kaneda.

814
01:25:08,230 --> 01:25:10,620
Loan Agreement

815
01:25:14,170 --> 01:25:15,880
We must do this...

816
01:25:17,240 --> 01:25:19,630
or we'll both be in deep shit.

817
01:25:28,950 --> 01:25:31,180
1. 5 billion yen

818
01:25:32,090 --> 01:25:34,040
He'll never come out of this.

819
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:37,180
They're yakuza, aren't they?

820
01:25:38,230 --> 01:25:40,100
Real ones, too.

821
01:25:57,150 --> 01:25:59,090
Guess who's here.

822
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:03,630
It's Mr Arai, the financial king
of the Korean immigrants.

823
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:07,180
What are you doing here?

824
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:12,180
You're needed
to unify our homeland.

825
01:26:14,070 --> 01:26:16,850
You'd better hurry off
in your Mercedes.

826
01:26:17,070 --> 01:26:21,180
Watch your tongue, you loser.

827
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:26,470
Why don't you wind up
the business?

828
01:26:27,010 --> 01:26:30,400
It's only a tiny taxi company,
no big deal.

829
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:34,700
Would you mind leaving us alone?

830
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:37,790
We're talking as ex-classmates.

831
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:41,390
Please ignore us.

832
01:26:46,530 --> 01:26:49,400
I suggest you act at once.

833
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:55,270
You're not bound
by Japanese law-.

834
01:26:55,470 --> 01:26:57,780
Shut up, you idiot!

835
01:27:03,850 --> 01:27:05,790
This is none of your business!

836
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:09,390
Shall we come back another day?

837
01:27:09,850 --> 01:27:14,800
You guys seem to get
easily excited.

838
01:28:34,440 --> 01:28:37,190
Keep well, Tadao.

839
01:28:41,150 --> 01:28:42,610
You too.

840
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:49,630
Why don't you say
a gentle word or two?

841
01:28:50,860 --> 01:28:52,210
Idiot!

842
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:03,390
Can't you even tell a lie?

843
01:29:04,170 --> 01:29:07,640
I could shed some tears then.

844
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:11,190
Damn you.

845
01:29:39,070 --> 01:29:40,780
How's business?

846
01:29:44,440 --> 01:29:46,630
It's so-so.

847
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:13,620
How's business?

848
01:30:24,650 --> 01:30:26,400
How's business?

849
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:52,190
It's so-so...

850
01:31:25,140 --> 01:31:27,250
Work's been very intense.

851
01:31:27,480 --> 01:31:30,270
Our boss is working
a lot harder.

852
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:19,180
The trouble is the loan
from the yakuza.

853
01:32:19,930 --> 01:32:24,400
Working flat out,
we can just pay the interest.

854
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:33,550
Nothing can surprise me now.

855
01:33:00,900 --> 01:33:04,930
What's that for? Why do you
hit an old man like me?

856
01:33:05,140 --> 01:33:07,850
My wheel came off
on the expressway!

857
01:33:08,080 --> 01:33:10,630
You changed it this morning.

858
01:33:18,160 --> 01:33:20,780
No violence, please!

859
01:33:20,990 --> 01:33:25,780
Stop it, Anbo. Who'll pay for
his funeral if you kill him?

860
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:30,550
- The company can't.
- I'll see to my own affairs.

861
01:33:30,770 --> 01:33:32,550
How will you do that?

862
01:33:35,010 --> 01:33:36,710
That's enough!

863
01:33:36,910 --> 01:33:39,170
He says he'll kill himself.

864
01:35:18,010 --> 01:35:19,190
Hello.

865
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:09,200
You know...

866
01:36:09,930 --> 01:36:12,400
I wanted to own a golf course.

867
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,390
I had to have it.

868
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:23,030
You should have been satisfied
with a pinball parlour.

869
01:36:24,170 --> 01:36:27,640
You'd have owned a building
if it had been successful.

870
01:36:34,850 --> 01:36:38,120
I'm sorry.
It was an accident.

871
01:36:48,930 --> 01:36:51,400
For both yakuza and Koreans...

872
01:36:53,070 --> 01:36:56,020
there'll be a lot of work to do.

873
01:37:13,420 --> 01:37:15,370
It's not a big deal.

874
01:37:43,320 --> 01:37:45,790
May I? Thank you.

875
01:38:04,670 --> 01:38:06,620
Another one, please.

876
01:38:06,840 --> 01:38:08,630
A different pose.

877
01:38:19,320 --> 01:38:22,270
Now, now.
There's a good baby...

878
01:39:19,150 --> 01:39:22,100
Fire! Fire!

879
01:39:31,090 --> 01:39:32,640
Bring water!

880
01:39:36,430 --> 01:39:39,270
The hose, quick!

881
01:40:06,330 --> 01:40:07,880
Sell!

882
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:30,830
Put it out, quick, you bastards!

883
01:40:31,860 --> 01:40:33,210
You fucking...

884
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:36,260
The fire!

885
01:42:57,830 --> 01:43:01,180
I want a Filipina called Connie.

886
01:43:01,770 --> 01:43:03,880
Found her at last!

887
01:43:04,510 --> 01:43:10,380
I caught a bad disease
from that rotten woman.

888
01:43:11,080 --> 01:43:14,030
I'm coming for her now.

889

Connie...

897
01:45:33,390 --> 01:45:36,860
I'm the only one
who can understand you.

898
01:45:38,830 --> 01:45:40,380
Listen, Connie.
