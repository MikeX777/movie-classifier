1
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:34,612
A post funeral ceremony
(religious verses in Punjabi)

2
00:04:26,412 --> 00:04:29,959
Losing both your parents in an
accident seemed like a conspiracy.

3
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:38,170
It was just that I
had no one to blame for it.

4
00:05:09,589 --> 00:05:10,589
Chhoti.

5
00:05:27,737 --> 00:05:29,333
No need to make any more tea.

6
00:05:32,317 --> 00:05:35,787
Are they to mourn or...?

7
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:39,695
It's only close family now.

8
00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:41,418
Grandpa, aunt and ...

9
00:05:43,408 --> 00:05:46,400
Chhoti is crying in the
bathroom go give her some water.

10
00:05:46,709 --> 00:05:48,109
I'll take the tea.

11
00:05:53,025 --> 00:05:54,407
Till the time he
completes his college..

12
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:56,071
..Mukesh will stay with you.

13
00:05:57,522 --> 00:05:59,987
Father-in-law,
I have a touring job.

14
00:06:00,933 --> 00:06:02,965
Your daughter runs the house.

15
00:06:04,654 --> 00:06:09,039
I will abide by
whatever you two decide.

16
00:06:10,498 --> 00:06:13,227
Papaji, we never dared to
have a second child of our own.

17
00:06:18,858 --> 00:06:21,970
We have neither the
space nor the means...

18
00:06:23,272 --> 00:06:24,955
Nothing is hidden from you.

19
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:27,247
He is like my own son.

20
00:06:27,613 --> 00:06:29,633
But, how can I take
his responsibility?

21
00:06:29,713 --> 00:06:31,011
I understand...

22
00:06:33,497 --> 00:06:35,476
It was my son's age
to take responsibility.

23
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:39,016
But instead he has
left me with his share too.

24
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:44,273
Don't worry, I will take
care of any extra expenses bourne

25
00:06:45,252 --> 00:06:48,164
by you from my pension fund.

26
00:06:53,395 --> 00:06:55,853
But, his is a responsibility
we all must share.

27
00:07:12,219 --> 00:07:15,316
I am not going to Delhi.
I am going to stay here.

28
00:07:16,105 --> 00:07:18,034
And take care of Sonu and Chhoti.

29
00:08:45,094 --> 00:08:46,333
Bring me some butter.

30
00:08:47,532 --> 00:08:48,593
Coming!

31
00:08:56,892 --> 00:08:58,219
No breakfast, Mukesh?

32
00:08:58,585 --> 00:09:00,687
College must have already started.

33
00:09:03,975 --> 00:09:06,000
Eats enough... free loader!

34
00:09:13,093 --> 00:09:15,395
'I was offered the most
pedestrian course in college.'

35
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:25,008
'B.A Pass.'

36
00:10:21,608 --> 00:10:23,433
Why are you standing on my head!

37
00:10:23,655 --> 00:10:24,996
Want to inhale the smoke?

38
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,870
What do you want?

39
00:10:28,813 --> 00:10:30,645
You are always
in need of something.

40
00:10:30,895 --> 00:10:32,562
Aunt...I need some money.

41
00:10:33,255 --> 00:10:34,331
To get fliers printed.

42
00:10:34,485 --> 00:10:35,848
I am thinking of giving
private tuition to school kids.

43
00:10:35,928 --> 00:10:37,642
Will return the money
as soon as I get the job.

44
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:41,078
No harm dreaming.

45
00:10:44,503 --> 00:10:45,899
But what if you don't
get the tuitions?

46
00:10:46,087 --> 00:10:48,234
Your grandfather does
not send us a fortune!

47
00:10:50,353 --> 00:10:52,732
No point wasting
money on silly schemes.

48
00:11:12,812 --> 00:11:15,754
Don't you know a chess board attracts
evil spirits with scores to settle.

49
00:11:21,256 --> 00:11:22,550
Wait! Let me search your bag!

50
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:24,346
Why? Am I a thief?

51
00:11:24,557 --> 00:11:26,533
Kid, this is Delhi!
Here everyone is a thief!

52
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,301
On a good day you get robbed.

53
00:11:30,381 --> 00:11:33,047
On bad days you get killed
first and then robbed.

54
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,120
Kasparov.

55
00:11:38,562 --> 00:11:40,618
Wipe that innocent
look off your face!

56
00:11:41,302 --> 00:11:42,958
I catch coffin thieves
like you everyday.

57
00:11:45,532 --> 00:11:47,143
Hey! Stop!

58
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:50,721
What have you stolen?

59
00:11:51,478 --> 00:11:52,989
Must have stolen something?

60
00:11:53,255 --> 00:11:54,255
What?

61
00:11:54,658 --> 00:11:57,293
A corpse's gold tooth?
A diamond ring maybe?

62
00:12:00,659 --> 00:12:02,353
Come...follow me.

63
00:12:06,603 --> 00:12:09,356
Pious! Need an extra
day to make one box?

64
00:12:09,436 --> 00:12:11,353
He is the one Johnny bhai!

65
00:12:11,436 --> 00:12:14,785
Always loitering around
with a chess board!

66
00:12:15,554 --> 00:12:17,271
Come on, Kasparov...

67
00:12:18,312 --> 00:12:19,312
Sit down.

68
00:12:28,062 --> 00:12:29,977
Kasparov played like a bull!

69
00:12:31,026 --> 00:12:33,020
Karpov was the wily one!

70
00:12:40,211 --> 00:12:41,211
Come on.

71
00:12:41,773 --> 00:12:43,918
Take out your chess board!

72
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:09,869
What kept you so long?

73
00:13:10,544 --> 00:13:12,397
The ladies have already
started arriving.

74
00:13:13,336 --> 00:13:15,362
Clean up,
at least look a little presentable.

75
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,031
We're having a kitty party.

76
00:13:49,513 --> 00:13:50,828
All the ladies are here.

77
00:13:51,272 --> 00:13:55,016
Yes! Yes! Sarika is here too!

78
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,669
Sarika, my husband says hello.

79
00:13:58,449 --> 00:14:00,271
Hello.

80
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:05,261
So, Mukesh!

81
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:08,713
Working very hard.

82
00:14:09,525 --> 00:14:11,313
Come over to help me sometimes too.

83
00:14:24,552 --> 00:14:26,377
So... when can I expect you?

84
00:14:27,131 --> 00:14:29,075
Mr. Khanna is of hardly
any use in the house!

85
00:14:32,258 --> 00:14:34,931
She just likes to embarrass you!
Don't go pink in the face.

86
00:14:54,021 --> 00:14:57,392
Sarika wants to send
over a case of apples!

87
00:14:58,165 --> 00:14:59,495
Go and pick it up soon.

88
00:14:59,637 --> 00:15:01,560
I'll go next Sunday.

89
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:05,138
Make us all a pot of
good steaming tea, son.

90
00:15:27,228 --> 00:15:29,202
Sarika called again
about the case if apples.

91
00:15:31,613 --> 00:15:34,436
Tomorrow is a holiday
go pick it up.

92
00:15:36,339 --> 00:15:38,981
Listen, her husband
is your uncle's superior.

93
00:15:40,411 --> 00:15:41,937
When such a people call you

94
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:45,145
even to pick up their rubbish
you thank them for the chance.

95
00:15:46,781 --> 00:15:48,844
And here she wants to
send over a case of apples!

96
00:15:52,136 --> 00:15:53,632
Don't delay it... go tomorrow.

97
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,627
Let me know if you
need anymore bread.

98
00:16:02,901 --> 00:16:05,795
Amit! Get up, son.

99
00:16:06,449 --> 00:16:07,849
It's noon already.

100
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:14,873
You still here?

101
00:16:15,108 --> 00:16:16,720
Just leaving...

102
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:03,041
Is Sarika ma'am at home?

103
00:17:03,209 --> 00:17:05,262
Who has called you?
There is no Sarika here.

104
00:17:06,257 --> 00:17:07,343
What do you want?

105
00:17:07,597 --> 00:17:09,607
I am Mrs. Verma's nephew.

106
00:17:09,687 --> 00:17:11,374
I have come for the case of apples.

107
00:17:11,721 --> 00:17:12,953
Listen to me carefully.

108
00:17:14,414 --> 00:17:18,912
She is a witch! A proper witch!

109
00:17:19,552 --> 00:17:22,187
A snake in a woman's body!

110
00:17:23,159 --> 00:17:25,235
There are no apples here.
I have thrown them all away!

111
00:17:25,797 --> 00:17:26,797
Now run away!

112
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:29,581
There is no one home... run away!

113
00:17:29,828 --> 00:17:31,561
Beware of her!

114
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:34,749
Now you show me respect
but later you will also abuse me!

115
00:17:34,829 --> 00:17:36,494
Beware! She will tie you up!

116
00:17:38,816 --> 00:17:40,001
Go! Run away!

117
00:17:44,441 --> 00:17:45,441
Biji!

118
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:53,721
I have told you not to
open the door to strangers!

119
00:17:56,321 --> 00:17:59,046
One day someone will slash
our throats and rob everything.

120
00:18:04,093 --> 00:18:06,033
Shut the door behind you.

121
00:19:05,121 --> 00:19:06,121
Dolls?

122
00:19:07,201 --> 00:19:11,290
They are mine, my father
was in the foreign services.

123
00:19:12,789 --> 00:19:15,471
I have travelled to many countries
with him when I was a child.

124
00:19:18,001 --> 00:19:19,001
Sit.

125
00:19:45,721 --> 00:19:47,346
Did Pammi not tell you my name?

126
00:19:54,809 --> 00:19:55,809
Sarika.

127
00:20:02,281 --> 00:20:07,337
Why are you always
doing od jobs in the house?

128
00:20:09,162 --> 00:20:10,812
Don't you have friends?

129
00:20:25,914 --> 00:20:27,046
What's the matter?

130
00:20:30,721 --> 00:20:32,283
Do I make you nervous?

131
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,209
You are not a little boy anymore.

132
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:50,526
Someone might think
that I am misbehaving.

133
00:20:54,361 --> 00:20:55,361
Who?

134
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:03,045
Biji.

135
00:21:05,113 --> 00:21:08,655
She is sleeping...she
can sleep through a bomb blast!

136
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:15,079
I have come for the case of apples.

137
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:23,066
You took your time coming
there was a last one left.

138
00:21:24,431 --> 00:21:26,824
My husband gave
it away this morning.

139
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:34,343
More will come soon from
my brother's orchard in Shimla.

140
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:55,818
Your hair is thick like a girl's!

141
00:21:58,547 --> 00:22:01,384
Comb it properly or get it cut!

142
00:22:55,321 --> 00:22:56,321
Lie down.

143
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:36,081
Hmm... you're not as afraid
as you were pretending to be!

144
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:34,451
Are you in a hurry? Do you
have an appointment elsewhere?

145
00:24:46,249 --> 00:24:48,961
Hello.. - Pammi... Sarika here.

146
00:24:50,087 --> 00:24:51,921
I am sending Mukesh to the
market to run an errand for me.

147
00:24:52,265 --> 00:24:53,265
Hope you don't mind?

148
00:24:53,761 --> 00:24:55,417
No...no...not at all!

149
00:24:55,925 --> 00:25:00,929
He hardly does anything
after returning from college.

150
00:25:02,285 --> 00:25:05,201
I've taught him everything so that
he does not sit around in the house.

151
00:25:05,281 --> 00:25:06,627
Idling his time away.

152
00:25:07,097 --> 00:25:09,291
But do make sure he
gives you proper accounting!

153
00:25:12,337 --> 00:25:14,342
Thank you, Pammi. I'll talk later.

154
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:25,641
Your aunt has taught you shopping
and I'll teach you the rest!

155
00:26:27,327 --> 00:26:28,327
Take a bath.

156
00:26:28,411 --> 00:26:29,913
I already did... in the morning!

157
00:26:32,373 --> 00:26:33,961
Then take a bath again.

158
00:26:58,681 --> 00:26:59,853
Bite me.

159
00:27:00,821 --> 00:27:02,531
I want you to leave marks!

160
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:16,407
You are too much in a hurry kid!

161
00:27:17,409 --> 00:27:18,593
There goes your queen!

162
00:27:41,874 --> 00:27:43,102
You are making progress.

163
00:27:44,841 --> 00:27:46,561
But there is still
a long way to go.

164
00:27:48,868 --> 00:27:49,868
Check!

165
00:28:40,987 --> 00:28:41,987
Choke me!

166
00:29:19,201 --> 00:29:23,202
Get a haircut and
buy some decent clothes.

167
00:29:25,831 --> 00:29:29,356
You bloody virgin!
You have become quite a whore!

168
00:30:22,561 --> 00:30:25,490
Delhi air is something!
Did you look at his hair style?

169
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:32,361
Your grandfather is yet
to send money this month.

170
00:30:32,441 --> 00:30:33,521
From where have you got
the new shoes and clothes?

171
00:30:33,601 --> 00:30:35,304
I managed to get
a couple of tuitions.

172
00:30:35,521 --> 00:30:36,641
He is lying.

173
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:42,034
There has been no inquiry
for an under graduate tutor!

174
00:30:44,921 --> 00:30:49,130
I got it through
the college librarian.

175
00:30:49,521 --> 00:30:51,281
Stays nearby, few blocks from here.

176
00:30:52,761 --> 00:30:54,387
Where are you off to on a holiday?

177
00:30:56,081 --> 00:30:57,294
I have tuition to give.

178
00:31:03,585 --> 00:31:04,773
Ashok is at home.

179
00:31:05,241 --> 00:31:07,635
Keep your ears & eyes
open and your mouth shut.

180
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:16,845
She puts chains on my feet!
But I am not a fool! You hear?

181
00:31:17,961 --> 00:31:20,988
Biji! Apply the brakes
or it is off to bed for you!

182
00:31:24,201 --> 00:31:27,581
He is always hanging around
the house in your absence!

183
00:31:59,467 --> 00:32:01,181
He got late going
to the club today...

184
00:32:01,935 --> 00:32:03,359
I'll have to buy
you a cell phone now.

185
00:32:04,241 --> 00:32:05,740
Don't forget to get the bill.

186
00:32:07,481 --> 00:32:08,561
who is he?

187
00:32:09,161 --> 00:32:11,500
Mrs. Verma's nephew,
very helpful boy.

188
00:32:14,074 --> 00:32:16,395
'That evening I could not
make it back to Sarika's house.'

189
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:20,015
'I was on my way to my home town,
Tohana.'

190
00:32:52,361 --> 00:32:55,207
Sonu and Chhoti
are our responsibility

191
00:32:56,587 --> 00:32:58,599
but we are barely making ends meet.

192
00:33:00,521 --> 00:33:06,321
Mukesh, finish your college quickly.
Everyone's counting on you.

193
00:33:09,344 --> 00:33:11,680
We should sent Chhoti
and Sonu to a girl's home.

194
00:33:15,761 --> 00:33:18,081
Pammi is over burdened as it is.

195
00:33:22,081 --> 00:33:24,514
Sonu...Chhoti...hurry up.

196
00:33:42,665 --> 00:33:43,935
Come on its getting late.

197
00:33:44,015 --> 00:33:46,641
Don't worry,
your brother will visit you often.

198
00:34:15,801 --> 00:34:17,401
'Sarika knew what
was going on in my life.'

199
00:34:17,965 --> 00:34:19,831
'But at first she
chose to remain quiet.'

200
00:34:20,713 --> 00:34:21,716
'Then one day out of the blue..'

201
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:23,442
Now you will be needing money!

202
00:34:24,163 --> 00:34:25,481
Help this lady out.

203
00:34:26,868 --> 00:34:29,294
She will pay for small
but important errands.

204
00:34:31,763 --> 00:34:33,858
If you are reliable
there would be more jobs.

205
00:34:42,561 --> 00:34:44,084
I am Mukesh.

206
00:34:44,982 --> 00:34:45,982
Stop here.

207
00:34:57,244 --> 00:34:59,302
Hello! I'm Mukesh.

208
00:34:59,742 --> 00:35:01,062
I spoke to you over
the phone yesterday.

209
00:35:01,206 --> 00:35:03,022
Yes...yes... come in.

210
00:35:16,837 --> 00:35:18,938
I can't do this.

211
00:35:22,188 --> 00:35:23,188
Why not?

212
00:35:26,295 --> 00:35:28,187
You seem to be doing
pretty alright here!

213
00:35:29,142 --> 00:35:30,872
I wasn't doing it for the money!

214
00:35:35,488 --> 00:35:36,488
What happened?

215
00:35:37,354 --> 00:35:41,377
First she gave me money,
it seemed excessive.

216
00:35:42,634 --> 00:35:43,885
Then...

217
00:35:45,161 --> 00:35:47,002
When I refused she
said she would scream!

218
00:35:47,622 --> 00:35:51,644
She never said anything of that
sort to me seemed pretty happy.

219
00:35:52,587 --> 00:35:55,302
She threatened me that
she would call in the neighbors..

220
00:35:55,605 --> 00:35:57,359
..and say that I had
broken into the house!

221
00:36:01,293 --> 00:36:02,675
I can't do this...

222
00:36:03,665 --> 00:36:05,386
I am not that kind of a boy!

223
00:36:06,542 --> 00:36:07,542
Really!

224
00:36:10,663 --> 00:36:12,094
What kind of a boy are you?

225
00:36:12,846 --> 00:36:15,711
To sleep with women for money!

226
00:36:21,188 --> 00:36:24,058
You take the money!
I don't want any of it!

227
00:36:42,208 --> 00:36:45,318
I've taken my share,
the rest is yours.

228
00:36:48,782 --> 00:36:50,096
I won't do it.

229
00:36:50,858 --> 00:36:55,428
What else do you think you are qualified
for in the first year of college?

230
00:36:57,982 --> 00:37:05,015
Fine! Leave then Don't
come around here anymore!

231
00:37:06,088 --> 00:37:07,088
Get lost!

232
00:37:12,253 --> 00:37:14,588
I give you a chance and
you come back crying like a kid.

233
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,559
Don't show me your face again!

234
00:37:38,232 --> 00:37:39,232
Mukesh.

235
00:37:59,822 --> 00:38:04,344
Do you really want to go on living
like a servant in your aunt's house?

236
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:09,171
Come.

237
00:38:11,833 --> 00:38:13,869
Think of all that you
can do with the money.

238
00:38:16,685 --> 00:38:18,660
You can call your
sisters to live with you!

239
00:38:27,595 --> 00:38:29,542
Don't think how the
money comes be happy to know

240
00:38:32,697 --> 00:38:35,039
that there will be more coming.

241
00:38:39,217 --> 00:38:41,518
If nothing else think
of it as social service!

242
00:38:44,472 --> 00:38:47,480
Just do it...

243
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,352
As it is one has to do
a lot for other's happiness.

244
00:38:56,642 --> 00:38:58,114
Think about yourself for once.

245
00:38:59,783 --> 00:39:01,189
Don't you like me?

246
00:39:01,742 --> 00:39:05,661
I like everything! You as well!

247
00:39:08,419 --> 00:39:14,265
I also like the benefits
of a marriage in Delhi's society.

248
00:39:25,036 --> 00:39:26,559
I have taught you well!

249
00:39:28,345 --> 00:39:32,452
Now the world will
enjoy your talents.

250
00:39:42,748 --> 00:39:45,100
'The phone numbers were real,
the names were not.'

251
00:39:45,888 --> 00:39:48,102
'I had to ask for the fake name.'

252
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:50,222
Hello, Neha ma'am.

253
00:39:50,741 --> 00:39:52,403
'If there was any hesitation
on the other end..'

254
00:39:52,707 --> 00:39:54,692
'..I pretended to have
gotten the wrong number.'

255
00:40:12,902 --> 00:40:15,098
You understand what client
servicing means, don't you?

256
00:40:16,388 --> 00:40:18,500
Keep them happy and
they will call you again.

257
00:40:19,477 --> 00:40:20,982
Do whatever they ask of you.

258
00:40:22,702 --> 00:40:23,902
Complaints will not be tolerated.

259
00:40:24,302 --> 00:40:26,822
(Soap opera on TV)

260
00:40:32,435 --> 00:40:34,062
Didn't this fellow Rakesh
die in last week's episode?

261
00:40:34,142 --> 00:40:36,003
Don't you have a TV in your house?

262
00:40:36,835 --> 00:40:38,382
I hardly get the time,
catch up on it.

263
00:40:38,462 --> 00:40:40,502
When I am with you.

264
00:40:43,116 --> 00:40:47,302
Ok, I will tell you
the story after that.

265
00:40:51,986 --> 00:40:53,890
A speeding Rakesh
loses control of his car.

266
00:40:55,987 --> 00:40:58,012
Which then falls into a river...

267
00:41:00,112 --> 00:41:03,982
Dheeraj, you scum! You low life!

268
00:41:05,209 --> 00:41:08,560
But he is saved by
the second heroine Ganga!

269
00:41:09,835 --> 00:41:11,797
You were dying to have an affair,
were you not?

270
00:41:14,097 --> 00:41:15,097
Get lost!

271
00:41:18,591 --> 00:41:20,349
So Ganga saves Rakesh's life.

272
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:23,281
But dies herself. A distraught
Rakesh returns to the city!

273
00:41:24,115 --> 00:41:25,244
to the first heroine Priya.

274
00:41:25,582 --> 00:41:28,542
Who is Dheeraj? If I may ask.

275
00:41:29,652 --> 00:41:32,192
The asshole in my lord
and master... my husband.

276
00:41:34,381 --> 00:41:35,981
Rakesh is dead again !

277
00:41:36,982 --> 00:41:38,742
Yes, this time he's really dead.

278
00:41:42,349 --> 00:41:47,473
Forget about that episode.
Let's finish this episode first.

279
00:42:58,307 --> 00:43:01,695
Hello! Chhoti,
did you get the money I sent you?

280
00:43:02,347 --> 00:43:05,631
Yes, but the warden was
asking too many questions.

281
00:43:06,507 --> 00:43:07,667
Give the phone to Sonu.

282
00:43:08,547 --> 00:43:10,242
Always wants to speak with you.

283
00:43:12,387 --> 00:43:13,924
What was the warden saying?

284
00:43:14,147 --> 00:43:16,564
Same old stuff, who sent the money?

285
00:43:19,152 --> 00:43:21,215
How do I know that
he is really your brother?

286
00:43:21,982 --> 00:43:24,265
If he is so loaded then why
has he dumped both of you here?

287
00:43:24,422 --> 00:43:26,311
Don't worry, I will come
there and have a word with her.

288
00:43:26,907 --> 00:43:28,295
Chhoti, you go from here.

289
00:43:34,027 --> 00:43:37,471
There is something
not right with this place.

290
00:43:37,926 --> 00:43:39,827
The girls here...

291
00:43:40,307 --> 00:43:41,667
Are they troubling you?

292
00:43:41,747 --> 00:43:44,569
They go out at night in fancy cars,
all dolled up.

293
00:43:45,507 --> 00:43:49,237
Return in the morning,
drunk and loaded with money.

294
00:43:49,827 --> 00:43:53,869
The warden gets a cut too!

295
00:43:54,747 --> 00:43:56,907
Yesterday they were forcing
me to go out with them...

296
00:43:57,187 --> 00:44:01,763
Don't worry, I will come
soon and speak to the warden.

297
00:44:04,827 --> 00:44:06,633
Take care of yourself..

298
00:44:08,688 --> 00:44:09,688
bye.

299
00:44:25,947 --> 00:44:27,365
Don't schedule anything
for the weekend.

300
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:28,519
Why?

301
00:44:28,877 --> 00:44:32,050
I am going to meet my sisters. I
will go every weekend from now on.

302
00:44:33,154 --> 00:44:34,494
What do you think this is,
a government job

303
00:44:34,574 --> 00:44:35,855
that you will get the weekend off?

304
00:44:36,387 --> 00:44:38,878
Go this time...
But don't make it a habit!

305
00:44:42,227 --> 00:44:44,100
Which way to the warden office?

306
00:44:54,387 --> 00:44:56,467
Why don't you take then with you?

307
00:44:59,907 --> 00:45:01,007
I will soon.

308
00:45:05,819 --> 00:45:08,987
Till then, I want them
to be looked after well.

309
00:45:11,267 --> 00:45:15,107
They are still very young
and I have heard that...

310
00:45:15,627 --> 00:45:17,143
What have you heard?

311
00:45:20,827 --> 00:45:22,824
Don't think there is
nobody looking out for them.

312
00:45:27,003 --> 00:45:29,787
I have brought a phone for them.

313
00:45:29,928 --> 00:45:32,463
No need for a personal phone.

314
00:45:33,801 --> 00:45:39,128
There is a public phone here.
You talk to them often, don't you?

315
00:45:44,987 --> 00:45:48,231
Buy some gifts for your children.

316
00:46:00,547 --> 00:46:03,227
Keep this and call me everyday.

317
00:46:03,614 --> 00:46:06,787
I will make sure
there is enough credit.

318
00:46:07,909 --> 00:46:09,971
We don't want to stay here!

319
00:46:10,347 --> 00:46:13,942
Just a few more days
then I will come and get you.

320
00:46:15,747 --> 00:46:16,747
Promise.

321
00:46:20,067 --> 00:46:21,554
O Mauritius.

322
00:46:23,587 --> 00:46:25,285
You are not going to become any fairer
by spending hours under the tap!

323
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:26,499
Fat fuck!

324
00:46:26,579 --> 00:46:29,109
Has bath once a year and finishes
the whole colony's water supply.

325
00:46:29,667 --> 00:46:31,187
Why would I have a bath everyday,
pretty boy?

326
00:46:31,417 --> 00:46:33,518
I don't run a side
business like you.

327
00:46:33,907 --> 00:46:36,147
Then maybe you should
start running one!

328
00:46:36,347 --> 00:46:39,707
Or else you will keep dreaming
about going to Mauritius

329
00:46:39,787 --> 00:46:41,689
and never actually get there!

330
00:46:41,907 --> 00:46:43,107
Stop whining!

331
00:46:43,812 --> 00:46:46,696
There is water left for
you to wash your ass clean!

332
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:49,467
Johnny bhai.

333
00:46:49,547 --> 00:46:53,683
Hey, tuition master!
Come meet the headmaster.

334
00:46:54,787 --> 00:46:56,654
He is studying to be
a doctor of philosophy.

335
00:46:56,987 --> 00:46:57,987
Ph.D?

336
00:46:58,587 --> 00:47:01,022
Yeah, in chemistry during the day
and in biology during the night!

337
00:47:01,307 --> 00:47:05,289
Better than you, you slob. Making a
living out of scavenging the dead!

338
00:47:06,317 --> 00:47:09,910
That's where you are going to end
up yourself sooner than you think!

339
00:47:10,301 --> 00:47:13,667
It doesn't take much
for the times to change, son.

340
00:47:14,059 --> 00:47:16,015
Fuck off!
Your entire existence is ill timed.

341
00:47:18,987 --> 00:47:20,087
Johnny bhai.

342
00:47:23,547 --> 00:47:25,044
I have a small gift for you.

343
00:47:29,111 --> 00:47:31,929
Forever indebted to you, my friend!

344
00:48:47,607 --> 00:48:50,552
In the beginning I waited
for my husband to get better...

345
00:48:53,957 --> 00:48:59,947
Knew that it might never happen,
but I had hope...

346
00:49:05,953 --> 00:49:08,609
Then eventually,
I started waiting for him to die...

347
00:49:11,209 --> 00:49:16,268
Years went by...I
just kept on waiting...

348
00:49:18,403 --> 00:49:22,414
Sometimes hoping that
my husband would get better.

349
00:49:24,314 --> 00:49:29,792
Sometimes wishing that he would die
so that his suffering would end.

350
00:49:36,627 --> 00:49:38,703
You have no one close?
No immediate family?

351
00:49:39,495 --> 00:49:42,621
I have a son,
a little elder to you...

352
00:49:44,747 --> 00:49:49,386
Lives in Singapore...
sends money too.

353
00:49:51,027 --> 00:49:55,187
But can't come himself
He's got a job, it's difficult.

354
00:51:13,307 --> 00:51:17,622
You go now, the relatives
will be arriving any time now.

355
00:51:46,907 --> 00:51:49,640
Not much action seems
have happened here last night!

356
00:51:57,288 --> 00:51:58,573
Her husband passed away...

357
00:52:06,424 --> 00:52:09,288
I was trying to call,
Why didn't you answer?

358
00:52:09,587 --> 00:52:12,155
I was in the hospital,
Has switched the ringer off.

359
00:52:17,987 --> 00:52:23,067
Come on, then! We have
paid the rent, why waste it!

360
00:52:27,147 --> 00:52:28,198
What's the matter?

361
00:52:29,467 --> 00:52:31,142
I have just left
his body at her house!

362
00:52:49,658 --> 00:52:52,603
Come I'll drop you home.

363
00:52:57,227 --> 00:52:59,007
Don't come home for a few days.

364
00:53:05,467 --> 00:53:07,503
Ashok seems to be in a strange
mood he has no fixed routine.

365
00:53:07,583 --> 00:53:09,013
Comes and goes as he pleases.

366
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:15,460
Are you angry with me?

367
00:53:20,947 --> 00:53:23,765
You are not my husband that I need to
throw a tantrum to get your attention?

368
00:53:25,698 --> 00:53:27,022
Just do as I tell you.

369
00:53:29,147 --> 00:53:31,101
I'll let you know when
is a good time to come.

370
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:39,229
Just drop me off here,
I have some work.

371
00:53:54,867 --> 00:53:56,543
That's my friend Johnny.

372
00:53:59,241 --> 00:54:00,306
I'll leave now.

373
00:54:01,070 --> 00:54:02,410
Why did you make me meet him?

374
00:54:03,267 --> 00:54:07,067
He is a friend! Lives nearby. I play
chess with him in the cemetery.

375
00:54:07,147 --> 00:54:08,903
Have you blabbered anything
to him about our work?

376
00:54:09,228 --> 00:54:13,553
No! I just told him that
you help me get tuitions.

377
00:54:14,956 --> 00:54:17,947
Good! Your minds has also
sharpened up along with your body.

378
00:54:31,387 --> 00:54:34,295
So partner,
why did you want to see me?

379
00:54:35,227 --> 00:54:36,150
I need a house.

380
00:54:36,230 --> 00:54:37,318
Are you looking to buy one?

381
00:54:37,544 --> 00:54:39,659
No, want to rent one.

382
00:54:41,547 --> 00:54:45,280
So what is the problem?- Nobody
wants to give it to a bachelor.

383
00:54:46,187 --> 00:54:49,147
And I can't call my sister
here until I have a house.

384
00:54:49,627 --> 00:54:51,747
Don't worry! Call your sisters!

385
00:54:52,655 --> 00:54:54,365
How can I call them
till I have a house!

386
00:54:55,401 --> 00:54:57,107
Don't worry about that!

387
00:54:57,649 --> 00:55:00,512
I have a lady friend too!

388
00:55:05,147 --> 00:55:07,147
What family were you talking about?
He is a bachelor!

389
00:55:07,347 --> 00:55:11,526
Why? I am there!

390
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:14,147
These days even two
men can start a family!

391
00:55:14,227 --> 00:55:15,723
Stay within your limits, Johnny!

392
00:55:16,770 --> 00:55:18,747
Just kidding!
He has got two lovely sisters.

393
00:55:19,368 --> 00:55:22,947
They will come and stay with him.
You can lord over them!

394
00:55:23,667 --> 00:55:25,193
They will help you
in your housework too!

395
00:55:25,625 --> 00:55:27,507
How much is the rent?

396
00:55:28,147 --> 00:55:31,070
3,000 rupees, no security because
Johnny has brought you here.

397
00:55:31,307 --> 00:55:33,164
But I will take
three months advance.

398
00:55:33,787 --> 00:55:35,315
My tenants will vacate
the room in 15 days.

399
00:55:35,507 --> 00:55:37,149
But you need to
pay the advance now.

400
00:55:37,515 --> 00:55:39,267
His sisters will
be here in 15 days.

401
00:55:40,227 --> 00:55:42,848
He will give you the advance then and
you hand us the keys at the same time.

402
00:55:43,227 --> 00:55:44,770
Fair and square, is it not?

403
00:55:46,587 --> 00:55:50,240
Look Johnny, my room shouldn't
go vacant even for a day.

404
00:55:50,667 --> 00:55:55,279
Your house is like my own!
I wouldn't be able to bear it.

405
00:55:55,827 --> 00:55:58,308
If you were to incur
any loss on my account!

406
00:55:58,627 --> 00:56:00,140
May I take one?

407
00:56:00,408 --> 00:56:01,408
Get lost!

408
00:56:03,787 --> 00:56:05,207
Are you a moron?

409
00:56:06,184 --> 00:56:08,252
Rushing to pay the advance when
the house isn't even vacant yet!

410
00:56:08,547 --> 00:56:10,241
You haven't understood
this city at all.

411
00:56:12,394 --> 00:56:16,011
Johnny bhai, thank you.

412
00:56:27,147 --> 00:56:28,911
Oye! What do you
think you are doing?

413
00:56:31,394 --> 00:56:33,987
Hey! I am talking to you!

414
00:56:36,307 --> 00:56:37,467
That is my drawer.

415
00:56:37,547 --> 00:56:41,095
It was my drawer till
you stuffed your things in.

416
00:56:42,582 --> 00:56:45,387
Your mother has given me the key.

417
00:56:45,627 --> 00:56:47,407
If my mother gave you
the house keys someday..

418
00:56:47,547 --> 00:56:48,938
..would the house be yours too?

419
00:56:49,867 --> 00:56:53,369
I pay my share of
the rent every month.

420
00:56:53,627 --> 00:56:55,651
You eat worth much
more in a single day!

421
00:56:59,075 --> 00:57:03,914
I will leave your house...
and your drawer as well!

422
00:57:08,238 --> 00:57:09,347
Quit talking about it.

423
00:57:09,670 --> 00:57:11,488
Why don't you actually
do it for a change.

424
00:57:35,507 --> 00:57:39,547
I told you not to come here!
What was so important?

425
00:57:45,144 --> 00:57:46,883
You should not trust me so much!

426
00:57:49,021 --> 00:57:50,418
Where else can I keep it?

427
00:57:51,116 --> 00:57:52,951
All the banks are asking
for an income proof.

428
00:57:54,029 --> 00:57:55,978
I will come and take
it in a couple of weeks.

429
00:57:58,627 --> 00:58:00,667
This bank will charge interest.

430
00:58:28,627 --> 00:58:29,739
Biji has woken up.

431
00:58:40,304 --> 00:58:44,507
If you can't knock like a civilized
person have the courtesy to look away.

432
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:49,640
Slut!

433
00:58:52,547 --> 00:58:55,504
Where the fuck do
you think you are going!

434
00:59:00,932 --> 00:59:02,828
Sit here!

435
00:59:06,028 --> 00:59:09,995
I thought my old
mother had gone senile!

436
00:59:10,867 --> 00:59:17,587
Then one day I asked myself
how long since Sarika nagged you?

437
00:59:18,467 --> 00:59:21,778
She seems content!
What has changed?

438
00:59:22,699 --> 00:59:25,028
I has my eye on you
but you sensed it some how!

439
00:59:25,287 --> 00:59:28,209
Clever slut that you are... But
you couldn't resist for long eh!

440
00:59:31,867 --> 00:59:35,079
Today I am going to knock
you back to your senses!

441
00:59:39,627 --> 00:59:40,627
Oye!

442
00:59:44,027 --> 00:59:45,907
Sit! Mother fucker.

443
00:59:46,307 --> 00:59:47,867
Watch and learn!

444
00:59:53,047 --> 00:59:54,692
Usually you are of no use

445
00:59:56,476 --> 00:59:59,485
does seeing me with him
turn you on? You pervert!

446
01:00:12,707 --> 01:00:17,067
If you think you are going
to fuck around behind my back..

447
01:00:17,147 --> 01:00:19,984
..and make me look like a fool...
then think again.

448
01:00:53,834 --> 01:00:59,553
'I was scared to go
back to my aunt's house.'

449
01:01:03,499 --> 01:01:07,507
'I needn't have been for Sarika's
husband had already dug my grave.'

450
01:01:21,107 --> 01:01:25,531
Mukesh had come home in the
afternoon to ask Sarika for a loan.

451
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:31,347
Said that he was not
being treated well by you.

452
01:01:31,827 --> 01:01:34,384
That you do not give him
proper food nor any pocket money.

453
01:01:34,968 --> 01:01:39,436
Inspite of our constraints
we try to do our best for him...

454
01:01:40,508 --> 01:01:48,467
He had been working well up till
now so Sarika felt sorry for him.

455
01:01:49,764 --> 01:01:52,528
At his age boys tend
to mistake sympathy from women

456
01:01:52,747 --> 01:01:54,187
for an interest of another kind.

457
01:01:54,387 --> 01:01:57,507
Yes, boys at this age
can indeed be very foolish.

458
01:01:57,587 --> 01:02:02,387
He tried to grab her
in front of my old mother.

459
01:02:08,107 --> 01:02:10,147
He was smelling of cheap liquor.

460
01:02:12,090 --> 01:02:17,218
So, Sarika pushed him away.
After that he just went mad.

461
01:02:19,271 --> 01:02:23,913
Tried to kiss her..

462
01:02:26,387 --> 01:02:28,857
Caught her arm so hard
that he has left marks!

463
01:02:30,779 --> 01:02:33,074
Sir, let him return home
my husband will take him to a task.

464
01:02:33,154 --> 01:02:36,707
Do not let him return
is what I came to say.

465
01:02:38,947 --> 01:02:41,170
Your husband is due for a promotion
it will be very unfortunate..

466
01:02:42,067 --> 01:02:43,858
..if instead of a promotion he has

467
01:02:43,938 --> 01:02:46,338
to sit in front of some
anti-corruption inquiry committee.

468
01:02:51,406 --> 01:02:52,406
Mukesh...

469
01:02:54,541 --> 01:02:56,985
pack your things right
away and leave the house!

470
01:02:58,180 --> 01:02:59,464
Where will I go, Buaji?

471
01:02:59,660 --> 01:03:00,676
I don't care.

472
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:06,188
Go to a friend! Or rent a room!

473
01:03:07,621 --> 01:03:09,798
Very independent you have become.

474
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:15,825
You make enough money giving
tuitions to get drunk on.

475
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:24,060
Mr. Khanna is lying! I had
just gone over to meet Sarika.

476
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:26,743
Everybody is aware
of Sarika's reputation.

477
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:30,871
Why her husband is targeting you,
I don't know.

478
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:35,580
But if you stay here, you
will land all of us in trouble...

479
01:03:36,060 --> 01:03:37,801
So for God's sake please spare us.

480
01:05:11,420 --> 01:05:12,420
Oye!

481
01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:17,283
Tuition master!

482
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:19,100
What happened?

483
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:24,440
And what's with all this luggage?

484
01:05:26,140 --> 01:05:27,140
Come with me...

485
01:05:28,580 --> 01:05:29,648
Come in.

486
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:43,079
Settle down.

487
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:52,740
Mauritius.

488
01:05:53,607 --> 01:05:56,260
My aunt's son lives there...
Keeps calling me, says..

489
01:05:56,820 --> 01:05:58,559
..a little investment
can take me far there

490
01:05:58,749 --> 01:06:00,815
But I say, I am too old
to settle in a new place.

491
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:04,472
Johnny bhai.

492
01:06:05,473 --> 01:06:06,900
My money is stuck somewhere.

493
01:06:07,706 --> 01:06:09,610
I will rent the room
as soon as I get it back.

494
01:06:13,180 --> 01:06:17,109
Play chess with me every night.
Stay for free as long as you like!

495
01:06:36,104 --> 01:06:37,540
When are you coming to get us?

496
01:06:37,620 --> 01:06:42,799
I'll be there soon!
Why? Has something happened?

497
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:45,770
No, but just come and get us fast.

498
01:06:45,979 --> 01:06:48,500
I'll be there don't worry!

499
01:07:07,620 --> 01:07:09,740
Hello, Kavita ma'am...

500
01:07:10,580 --> 01:07:11,819
Mukesh here.

501
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:14,095
Who Mukesh?
There is no Kavita here...

502
01:07:15,844 --> 01:07:17,437
Don't call back again.

503
01:07:26,502 --> 01:07:28,100
Hello, Reena ma'am.

504
01:07:28,247 --> 01:07:29,518
This is Mukesh here.

505
01:07:30,654 --> 01:07:33,868
You haven't called last few days so
I thought I should call and inquire.

506
01:07:33,948 --> 01:07:35,051
Wrong number.

507
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:40,388
Mrs. Kajal?
This is Mukesh calling.

508
01:07:41,258 --> 01:07:42,258
Usha ma'am.

509
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:43,620
This is Mukesh calling.

510
01:07:43,845 --> 01:07:45,740
Mrs. Vandana?
- Wrong number.

511
01:07:46,027 --> 01:07:47,662
Sorry, I won't call back again.

512
01:07:53,580 --> 01:07:55,416
Hello, Sarika ma'am...

513
01:07:55,540 --> 01:07:58,212
I have told you not to call here...
Don't call back again.

514
01:08:01,420 --> 01:08:03,100
This is Mukesh calling.

515
01:08:05,984 --> 01:08:06,984
Sorry.

516
01:08:53,660 --> 01:08:55,156
Who is there ma?

517
01:08:58,540 --> 01:09:00,885
Somebody's got the wrong address.

518
01:09:34,340 --> 01:09:35,593
What are you doing here?

519
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:38,220
Leave! My husband can come anytime!

520
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:41,740
Did he hit you?

521
01:09:43,380 --> 01:09:45,095
What else do you expect? A trophy?

522
01:09:46,779 --> 01:09:49,644
My sisters are coming,
I need my money.

523
01:09:50,340 --> 01:09:51,354
Are you done?

524
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:54,529
They rescheduled my
appointment for tomorrow.

525
01:10:29,420 --> 01:10:30,420
Breakfast!

526
01:10:42,422 --> 01:10:45,545
Johnny bhai, I need a favour?

527
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:47,300
What?

528
01:10:48,475 --> 01:10:52,519
You will have to go to that lady's
house the one that you met with me.

529
01:10:57,780 --> 01:10:59,578
Why don't you go yourself?

530
01:11:00,660 --> 01:11:06,338
My aunt lives in the same
colony if she sees me there...

531
01:11:11,060 --> 01:11:12,646
What work do you have with her?

532
01:12:05,766 --> 01:12:08,026
Sleeping through the
day begets bad luck my friend!

533
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:17,279
She says that your due
has already been paid to you.

534
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:21,685
Your lady friend didn't
even let me enter the house!

535
01:12:22,094 --> 01:12:23,580
She started shouting

536
01:12:24,221 --> 01:12:26,546
and threatening me saying
that she will call her husband!

537
01:12:28,675 --> 01:12:31,989
They have given your number to the
cops even filed a report against you...

538
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:36,333
What the hell are you upto? You
will get me into trouble as well

539
01:12:39,789 --> 01:12:41,274
Screwed up my work.

540
01:12:44,180 --> 01:12:45,887
Got me thrown out of the house.

541
01:12:47,620 --> 01:12:49,271
And now she says
she will not pay me!

542
01:12:52,060 --> 01:12:59,660
Bitch! Does she think I
am scared of her and her husband!

543
01:12:59,740 --> 01:13:01,660
What does she think of herself?

544
01:13:01,740 --> 01:13:04,066
Calm down!
Shut up and listen to me!

545
01:13:06,740 --> 01:13:08,596
What the fuck do
you think you are doing!

546
01:13:09,945 --> 01:13:11,785
Come to your senses!
Have you lost it!

547
01:13:20,620 --> 01:13:23,355
I don't know what kind
of tuitions you have been giving.

548
01:13:29,393 --> 01:13:30,853
But learn this from me.

549
01:13:32,743 --> 01:13:35,540
Take out your sim card!

550
01:13:37,620 --> 01:13:40,460
Stay away from them
they are rich and connected!

551
01:13:40,540 --> 01:13:43,532
They will get you busted
so bad you won't know what hit you!

552
01:13:46,382 --> 01:13:48,324
Give me the sim card
I will throw it away.

553
01:13:49,233 --> 01:13:51,911
If you throw my sim card
then how will my sisters call me?

554
01:13:52,340 --> 01:13:53,540
Give them my number!

555
01:13:53,620 --> 01:13:57,077
And what if someone calls you?
- Have you ever heard my phone ring?

556
01:14:01,220 --> 01:14:03,768
Use my card and
give them this number.

557
01:14:11,420 --> 01:14:13,380
I am not going to let
her get away with this!

558
01:14:14,123 --> 01:14:15,487
I will cut her to pieces!

559
01:14:16,038 --> 01:14:17,321
Don't talk shit.

560
01:14:19,540 --> 01:14:21,612
We are out of booze as well!
Come...

561
01:14:23,925 --> 01:14:24,980
Come on...

562
01:14:25,833 --> 01:14:27,704
This godforsaken town
is a real shit hole!

563
01:14:28,181 --> 01:14:31,081
You place your trust in people
thinking they are your friends.

564
01:14:31,420 --> 01:14:36,700
But the moment you turn around
they ram it right up your ass.

565
01:14:37,257 --> 01:14:39,996
I'll go give this
number to my sisters.

566
01:14:40,503 --> 01:14:44,167
Ok, but now don't go
stressing them out as well.

567
01:14:52,697 --> 01:14:53,540
Hello, Sonu!

568
01:14:53,620 --> 01:14:56,100
Are you alright?

569
01:14:56,780 --> 01:14:58,097
Who's number is this?

570
01:14:58,223 --> 01:15:00,063
It's a friend's number,
save it on your phone.

571
01:15:01,481 --> 01:15:03,187
What's this noise are you outside?

572
01:15:04,005 --> 01:15:08,077
What are you doing out so late?
- We have run away from there...

573
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:09,974
We are on our way to Delhi.

574
01:15:10,513 --> 01:15:11,598
Run away!

575
01:15:11,972 --> 01:15:15,038
What do you mean you have run away!
Have you gone mad!

576
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:16,540
What the hell is going on there?

577
01:15:16,620 --> 01:15:18,540
I'll explain everything
once I reach.

578
01:15:18,620 --> 01:15:20,100
I told you to stay
on for a few days!

579
01:15:20,289 --> 01:15:22,607
Can't you understand that much?
Are you little children!

580
01:15:22,687 --> 01:15:25,380
Brother, please don't
get angry...the warden.

581
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:27,804
What did she do?

582
01:15:29,220 --> 01:15:32,978
Sonu, tell me what happened?

583
01:15:33,220 --> 01:15:35,221
She got drunk and came in Chhoti's
room...

584
01:15:35,721 --> 01:15:37,026
Was trying to slip into her bed.

585
01:15:37,351 --> 01:15:40,780
I'll explain everything tomorrow.

586
01:15:41,060 --> 01:15:48,108
You both take care of yourselves...
Do you have money?

587
01:15:48,443 --> 01:15:49,349
Yes.

588
01:15:49,429 --> 01:15:51,617
Call me as soon as your reach,
I will come and get you.

589
01:15:57,220 --> 01:15:58,670
Here, gulp it down.

590
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:02,400
Johnny bhai.

591
01:16:04,140 --> 01:16:06,251
Could you lend me some money?

592
01:16:06,540 --> 01:16:08,449
I will return it soon.

593
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:11,500
Money?

594
01:16:14,300 --> 01:16:17,100
If I had any money saved do you think
I would have been stuck in this city.

595
01:16:17,281 --> 01:16:20,407
I would have gone away
to Mauritius long back!

596
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:27,224
I live off the dead!
I bury one corpse to get one meal!

597
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:31,538
I am surviving because
people die in this city everyday.

598
01:16:34,385 --> 01:16:36,700
I would have run
away long time back.

599
01:16:37,940 --> 01:16:42,576
To Mauritius...
to white sands... to blue skies...

600
01:16:45,318 --> 01:16:48,110
You are young you
will get many chances.

601
01:16:53,251 --> 01:16:54,251
Brother.

602
01:16:55,060 --> 01:16:56,302
Stop for a minute...

603
01:17:19,951 --> 01:17:23,112
You are with me because
this is your first night.

604
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:31,317
From tomorrow you are on your own.

605
01:17:35,124 --> 01:17:38,220
Be tough! Don't be scared!

606
01:18:00,700 --> 01:18:01,817
Do we wait here?

607
01:18:03,980 --> 01:18:05,180
I'll go first.

608
01:18:10,820 --> 01:18:12,401
How much money should I ask for?

609
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:18,420
2,000 rupees don't settle for less.

610
01:18:36,660 --> 01:18:38,948
Drink up!

611
01:18:45,780 --> 01:18:48,700
Go on, have another swig.
It eases the pain!

612
01:18:52,832 --> 01:18:53,882
Move aside.

613
01:18:56,935 --> 01:18:59,159
Time to get to work!

614
01:19:07,060 --> 01:19:08,281
Looking for fun?
- Yes!

615
01:19:08,940 --> 01:19:11,334
How much will you pay?
- Let's bargain on the way.

616
01:19:37,260 --> 01:19:39,740
There is one!
Standing all by himself!

617
01:19:39,820 --> 01:19:41,860
Back up.

618
01:19:49,873 --> 01:19:57,863
I am tired of whores around here
let's try the pretty boys for size!

619
01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:01,069
Three of you?

620
01:20:01,260 --> 01:20:03,709
Why, you gonna cook for us tonight?

621
01:20:06,660 --> 01:20:08,316
All three of you will have to pay!

622
01:20:10,940 --> 01:20:15,340
Sure, but let us
see the goods first.

623
01:20:16,660 --> 01:20:18,778
Go on, he is calling you!

624
01:20:19,420 --> 01:20:23,500
Why so wound up?
Are you a first timer?

625
01:20:26,820 --> 01:20:28,190
2,000 rupees for each of you!

626
01:20:29,540 --> 01:20:31,140
That's the rate,
take it or leave it!

627
01:20:31,220 --> 01:20:35,380
The little fucker wants
to play posh! Drag him in boys!

628
01:20:36,780 --> 01:20:38,980
Get in you faggot spreading
filth on the streets!

629
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:40,530
Give the money first.

630
01:20:40,610 --> 01:20:43,500
The motherfucker thinks
he is prime piece of ass!

631
01:20:45,701 --> 01:20:46,701
Let go of me!

632
01:20:48,911 --> 01:20:51,465
Don't worry about the three
of us you won't get past even one!

633
01:20:51,842 --> 01:20:53,656
Open the door! Let me out!

634
01:20:53,894 --> 01:20:56,149
Stop the car! Let me go!

635
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:02,946
What happened?

636
01:22:05,620 --> 01:22:08,417
Come here... Mukesh!

637
01:22:29,950 --> 01:22:31,150
What happened?

638
01:22:38,797 --> 01:22:39,797
Show!

639
01:22:47,217 --> 01:22:49,420
Look, I don't know
what's going on with you

640
01:22:50,597 --> 01:22:52,317
but whatever it is, get out of it.

641
01:22:52,740 --> 01:22:55,020
Forget the past... start afresh.

642
01:23:01,180 --> 01:23:03,446
Johnny, I won't give
up what is rightfully mine.

643
01:24:26,607 --> 01:24:27,607
Have you lost your mind!

644
01:24:32,928 --> 01:24:34,278
What do you want?

645
01:24:35,165 --> 01:24:38,846
I am not here for you...
My work has been stopped.

646
01:24:42,626 --> 01:24:43,626
Your work?

647
01:24:47,106 --> 01:24:49,066
I told your friend about it...
go ask him.

648
01:24:49,986 --> 01:24:51,968
Who stopped it?
- What do you think?

649
01:24:53,986 --> 01:24:55,014
Your husband?

650
01:24:57,506 --> 01:24:58,112
Why?

651
01:24:58,192 --> 01:25:00,551
He did not know about the work
or the boys.

652
01:25:03,906 --> 01:25:04,906
Boys?

653
01:25:07,306 --> 01:25:08,447
There were others.

654
01:25:27,985 --> 01:25:30,264
For the last time,
where is the money?

655
01:25:31,086 --> 01:25:35,586
There is 2,000 in the almirah,
take it and leave!

656
01:25:35,993 --> 01:25:38,252
Next time you come my husband
will be waiting for you!

657
01:25:38,386 --> 01:25:39,814
I haven't come for a handout!

658
01:25:40,514 --> 01:25:42,221
I want money that
is rightfully mine!

659
01:25:42,881 --> 01:25:44,586
So go and ask the
one who has taken it.

660
01:25:44,721 --> 01:25:46,006
Ask whom? Your husband?

661
01:25:46,836 --> 01:25:50,568
He earns more in a day than you
have managed in all these months!

662
01:25:50,940 --> 01:25:52,666
Go and ask your friend!

663
01:25:53,066 --> 01:25:55,026
The scoundrel even
looked like a thief.

664
01:25:55,346 --> 01:25:56,346
Don't lie.

665
01:25:58,548 --> 01:26:01,385
Why do you lie?

666
01:26:07,186 --> 01:26:09,234
Did you learn anything
from me in all these months?

667
01:26:09,845 --> 01:26:11,095
Apart from sex!

668
01:26:27,546 --> 01:26:34,921
Our work can start again,
leave now... Think of your sisters.

669
01:26:35,066 --> 01:26:37,808
I am never sinking
back into your filth again!

670
01:26:38,405 --> 01:26:40,842
I want my money and I want it now!

671
01:26:46,906 --> 01:26:48,386
Sarika, open the door.

672
01:26:50,316 --> 01:26:52,754
Did you foresee this while
you were planning your break in?

673
01:27:03,986 --> 01:27:05,266
Sarika! Open the door!

674
01:27:06,636 --> 01:27:08,915
I know there is someone inside!

675
01:27:10,786 --> 01:27:12,066
Open up!

676
01:27:14,890 --> 01:27:17,219
Open up or I will
cal in the neighbors!

677
01:27:23,986 --> 01:27:26,106
Today the whole world
will see your true colors...

678
01:27:26,186 --> 01:27:28,146
I will rub your face in dirt.

679
01:27:28,826 --> 01:27:29,826
Mukesh.

680
01:27:32,386 --> 01:27:33,386
Come here.

681
01:27:34,266 --> 01:27:36,219
I don't care what people
will think of me...

682
01:27:36,372 --> 01:27:38,609
But you will never be
able to face anyone again!

683
01:27:41,866 --> 01:27:43,481
Put the knife in me!

684
01:27:43,679 --> 01:27:44,679
What?

685
01:27:46,106 --> 01:27:48,226
You don't have to kill me!
Insert it in a little bit!

686
01:27:49,953 --> 01:27:51,927
Sarika! I'll break open the door!

687
01:27:55,786 --> 01:27:57,486
He will kill both of us!

688
01:28:02,546 --> 01:28:06,778
Good! We will die together
like star-crossed lovers!

689
01:28:31,195 --> 01:28:33,361
I am warning you for
the last time Sarika!

690
01:29:14,546 --> 01:29:15,821
That felt good.

691
01:29:43,171 --> 01:29:45,060
First class first!

692
01:29:47,017 --> 01:29:52,586
It was never Johnny who betrayed
me...It has always been you.

693
01:29:53,666 --> 01:29:55,629
And today,
you want to get away again.

694
01:29:56,545 --> 01:29:58,548
Not this time!

695
01:31:41,346 --> 01:31:42,666
This is Mukesh.

696
01:31:42,746 --> 01:31:43,861
Is Johnny there?

697
01:31:44,026 --> 01:31:45,126
Who, Karpov?

698
01:31:46,066 --> 01:31:46,866
Yes.

699
01:31:46,946 --> 01:31:47,946
He took off.

700
01:31:48,070 --> 01:31:49,220
To Mauritius.

701
01:31:52,066 --> 01:31:54,029
The lucky fucker
ran into a bag of cash!

702
01:32:22,057 --> 01:32:23,755
Johnny!

703
01:33:02,424 --> 01:33:05,066
Brother, we have reached.

704
01:33:05,586 --> 01:33:06,786
Where are you?

705
01:33:11,546 --> 01:33:14,476
We have been waiting
outside the train station.

706
01:33:14,706 --> 01:33:15,956
Are you coming?

707
01:33:20,986 --> 01:33:24,182
Wait there, I am on my way.

708
01:34:25,706 --> 01:34:27,026
He is the one, sir.

709
01:34:27,106 --> 01:34:28,146
Hey!

710
01:34:28,226 --> 01:34:29,426
Stop!

711
01:35:37,706 --> 01:35:39,786
Where are you?

712
01:35:41,666 --> 01:35:43,986
How much longer do
we have to wait here?

713
01:35:49,706 --> 01:35:51,475
Do you want us to
wait here all night?

714
01:35:52,004 --> 01:35:55,109
We will have fun skinning
you alive tonight! You runt!

715
01:35:56,063 --> 01:35:58,107
Why are you not answering?

716
01:36:08,637 --> 01:36:10,440
Nowhere to run now motherfucker.
