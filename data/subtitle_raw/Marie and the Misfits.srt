1
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:59,360
MARIE AND THE CASTAWAYS

2
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,640
Sorry.

3
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,360
Excuse me.

4
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,640
Thanks.

5
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,640
- What will it be?
- A beer, please.

6
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,240
Thank you.

7
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,520
It's my shout.

8
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,720
Okay.

9
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,800
Well... thank you.

10
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,080
You're welcome.

11
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,360
My name's Wim.

12
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,960
Simeon.

13
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,680
Come here often?

14
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,240
No, it's my first time.

15
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,240
I'm not from Paris.

16
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,400
I ended up here accidently.

17
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,800
You're from...?

18
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,960
Anvers, in Belgium.

19
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,800
I came here for a job interview.

20
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,080
Did it go well?

21
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,240
No.

22
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,800
They thought I lacked motivation.

23
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,360
I'm sorry.

24
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,240
Don't be.

25
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,960
I'm relieved actually.

26
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,920
I'm celebrating my failure.

27
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,120
Here's to you.

28
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,400
To your failure.

29
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,800
To our failures.

30
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,880
Shall we do the next song together?

31
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,960
No, I...

32
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,080
- I can't sing.
- Me neither.

33
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,120
So? Pass me the song list.

34
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,600
This one. This one's perfect.

35
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,240
I'm off.
I've had way too much to drink.

36
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,520
It was great to meet you, Wim.

37
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,240
Likewise.
Likewise, my friend.

38
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,680
Will we meet again...

39
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,080
definitely not,

40
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,240
but I'll never forget our duet.
Never.

41
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,360
Me neither.

42
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,080
Have a good trip to Anvers.

43
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,240
In actual fact,

44
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,680
I came here for medical tests.

45
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,400
And...

46
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,880
it's no picnic.

47
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,520
If you know what I mean.

48
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,960
No.

49
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,600
Go on home.

50
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,680
Off you go.

51
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,960
Go on, scram!

52
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,320
I was born in Paris,

53
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,480
in the early 80s.

54
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,520
I'm the youngest of 2 children.

55
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,680
After 12 years in
the army, my father

56
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,400
decided to escape his father's grip

57
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,600
and qualified as a gym teacher.

58
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,760
He met Mathilde
at the school he taught at.

59
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,560
It was love at first sight.

60
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,840
My brother was interested
physical labour,

61
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,320
whereas I, led by an
emotionally liberal mother,

62
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,960
chose the mind.

63
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,400
Mathilde and Jacques,

64
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,240
without ever saying so,

65
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,960
liked the divergent
directions our education took.

66
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,680
I began high school,

67
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,680
the time of first loves.

68
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,960
Above all, I liked being in love.

69
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,520
I dated with Laure
for almost two years.

70
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,400
Then Clarisse, but that didn't last.

71
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,560
And finally, Patricia.

72
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,240
I met my future best
friend at a concert,

73
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,240
Oscar.

74
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,840
I've seen them 3 times
and they keep getting worse.

75
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,840
That's known as a loss of innocence.

76
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,840
It's sad, but that's that.

77
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,680
What did he say?

78
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,840
It's the 3rd time he's seen them

79
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,120
and it's a loss of innocence.

80
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,280
They get worse.

81
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,760
Are you a couple?

82
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,840
Really? A shame.

83
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,680
And are you a couple?

84
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,240
That's a shame.

85
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,120
After graduating high school,
I studied journalism.

86
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,400
Patricia came too.

87
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,680
You don't want to?

88
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,480
Overnight, she wanted a baby.

89
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,120
I don't know.

90
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,760
Then you don't really love me.

91
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,680
She left me.

92
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,840
And I realised
I was in love with her.

93
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,120
I fell into a depression that

94
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,680
was brutally disrupted
by my Dad's death.

95
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,480
That tragic event
was a kind of wake-up call.

96
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:58,680
Suddenly, I had an urge to
shoulder my responsibilities.

97
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,400
I decided to keep dodging exercise,

98
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,120
to reduce my alcohol intake
and enter the workforce.

99
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,840
After some anecdotal experiences,

100
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,680
I was appointed editor

101
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,840
of Modoi's cultural section,

102
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,400
a publication boasting a daring
and discerning editorial policy.

103
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,920
My colleagues were
young, ambitious,

104
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,680
clean cut and moderately left-wing.

105
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,560
I tried to emulate them,
no second guessing.

106
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,680
I conformed.

107
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,760
In my second year at Modoi,

108
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,840
I met Beatrice.

109
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,960
I frequently summon up

110
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,400
the exact moment I first saw her

111
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,960
and what crossed my mind.

112
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,680
Hey!

113
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,120
Don't be shy now.

114
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,720
I'm curious to know
who you're texting.

115
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,120
Super crap opening line.

116
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,280
It's private.

117
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,560
Forget I asked.

118
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,840
I'll tell you.

119
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,560
He's called Sylvain.

120
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,400
I'm breaking up with him by text.

121
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,640
There.

122
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,480
As of now, I'm single...

123
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,120
open to the unknown.

124
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,680
That's how it began.

125
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,640
Alright.

126
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,200
My first two years with Beatrice

127
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,560
were like a romantic
adventure novel.

128
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,920
A fast-paced one.

129
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,280
Keeping it?

130
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,000
Yes.

131
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
At 26, I became a father.

132
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,840
Years went by,

133
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,400
time slowed down.

134
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,680
Sarah grew up.

135
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,840
Without Beatrice or I
articulating it,

136
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,720
the ties holding us together
gradually came undone.

137
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,560
Happiness doesn't last.

138
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,840
We decided to separate

139
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,080
before our love died out.

140
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,560
An astronaut

141
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:35,120
manages to live in a little
space shuttle for a month.

142
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,560
Seeing the Earth so small

143
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,720
through a port-hole
is enough for him.

144
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,680
I don't always get
what you say, Oscar,

145
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,120
but it helps.

146
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,560
Cool.

147
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,960
The crisis hit.

148
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,400
The crisis and

149
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,440
increasingly chaotic
financial management

150
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,680
saw Modoi fold.

151
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,680
The final issue

152
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:08,840
My only source of income
became the employment benefit.

153
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,800
And Oscar happened
to leave his girlfriend.

154
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,280
At the age of 30, we went flatting.

155
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,960
Now that I'm here,
I've got a vision.

156
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,280
I can see my turntables
right here, like this.

157
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,080
Two days ago, when we did the plans,

158
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,440
we said by the wall.

159
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,720
Brace yourself for change.

160
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,680
No, nothing's changing.

161
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,960
I have a vision.

162
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,840
It's great here. Like this...

163
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,880
Life resumed its course.

164
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,840
I tried to fall in love.

165
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,840
You might find this odd...

166
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,160
I'd rather ask you outright.

167
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,280
Here goes.

168
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:53,120
How about we try to spend
the rest of our lives together?

169
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,120
You're serious?

170
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,560
- Hi.
- Hi.

171
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,000
Have a good evening?

172
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,280
No.

173
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,280
Martha and I called it quits.

174
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,560
I made a desperate plea,
she's not interested.

175
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,960
Neither am I.

176
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,880
Who's this?

177
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,680
Her name is Marie.

178
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,520
I found her wallet
outside last night.

179
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,080
She looks familiar.
Don't you think?

180
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,600
She looks like the girl
in that commercial...

181
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,280
The commercial where they have...

182
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,800
but short and... I don't know.

183
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,560
Doesn't ring a bell.

184
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,440
I found her number
in the white pages.

185
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,720
You call a pretty girl like that.

186
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,520
Leave you to it.

187
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,280
Hello?

188
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,400
Not picking up?

189
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,840
Hello?

190
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,440
You called, it cut off.

191
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:36,400
Yes... yes. That's right.
I've got connection problems.

192
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,080
Who are you with?

193
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,320
Sorry?

194
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,160
Which company?

195
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,440
Do you work in telecommunications?

196
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,280
No.

197
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,000
I was just wondering.
I've had similar problems.

198
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,600
You tried to call me?

199
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:55,240
Actually, I found Marie
Andrieu's wallet last night.

200
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,600
I found her phone number
in the white pages...

201
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,320
She moved out.

202
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,560
Have you got her mobile number?

203
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,240
What for?

204
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,720
Um... to return her wallet.

205
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,080
Hello? Are you still there?

206
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:16,280
06 03 53...

207
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,600
...21 79.

208
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,520
Thank you.

209
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,120
Be wary of Marie.

210
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,160
Sorry?

211
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,680
She's dangerous.

212
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,320
Thanks.

213
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,400
Haven't we met before?

214
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,400
I don't think so.

215
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,440
When I saw your photo,
it felt like...

216
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,120
Now, it's the same.

217
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,320
Maybe I look like someone you know.

218
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,400
I've got quite a common face.

219
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,800
It's funny looking
like many people.

220
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,960
I don't think you do.

221
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,400
Really?

222
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,520
Truly.

223
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,400
I have to go.

224
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,040
Already?

225
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,120
I'm expecting a very important call.

226
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,720
So, thanks for coming
all this way. It was very...

227
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,440
Oh sorry! I'm so sorry.

228
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,400
I'll get the bill.

229
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,320
No, it's fine.

230
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,400
I insist.

231
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,160
There you go, too late.

232
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,320
- And thanks.
- Thanks.

233
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:45,840
Bye.

234
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,160
- Have you been there long?
- I just got here.

235
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,320
That's really good.

236
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,280
Not too esoteric?

237
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,840
No.

238
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,440
No, it's entrancing.

239
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,680
Dark and entrancing.

240
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,400
Would people dance to it?

241
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:50,880
Oh yeah.

242
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,280
It rings every 10 minutes.
They hang up on me.

243
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,560
I'll get it.

244
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,560
Hello?

245
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,560
By Simeon Forest
Modoi

246
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,560
Hello?

247
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,600
It's you.

248
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,320
It's you.
I recognise your breathing.

249
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,400
Sorry?

250
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,600
We spoke earlier,

251
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,480
about Marie.

252
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,600
So?

253
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,400
So what?

254
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,200
Did you see her?

255
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,880
Yes.

256
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,320
Seeing her again?

257
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,200
Why do you ask?

258
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,040
I'm advising you
not to see her again.

259
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,680
If you try to see her,

260
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,160
there'll be trouble.

261
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,880
I was born near Marseille.

262
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,480
Let's skip the first years.

263
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,120
I don't remember them.

264
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,560
And go straight to two
major childhood events.

265
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,480
When I was 6, my Dad took
me fishing for the 1st time.

266
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,840
He was a fisherman.

267
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,320
Hauling in a net,
he forgot about me momentarily.

268
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,280
I fell in.

269
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,840
The 2nd event
happened when I was 11.

270
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,720
I fell hopelessly in love
with my French teacher.

271
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,760
At the end of the year,

272
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,440
I decided to declare my love.

273
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:45,200
"What is there for me
in the world?"

274
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,600
"Other men strive for riches,

275
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,720
"celebrity and power!

276
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,680
"But I have no profession.

277
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,320
"You are my exclusive occupation.

278
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,200
"Do you not feel the aspiration
of my soul ascending toward yours,

279
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,440
"that they must intermingle,
that I am dying on your account?"

280
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,400
- That's...?
- Sentimental Education.

281
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,760
Now that it's the holidays,

282
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,400
I was wondering if...

283
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,640
we could go somewhere
far away, just the two of us.

284
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,280
She rejected my advances.

285
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,640
That episode left me with

286
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,280
a fierce desire to become
a writer and prove

287
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,040
to my teacher that indeed I could.

288
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,040
At the age of 30,

289
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:34,160
after many years of study,
I decided to leave Marseille.

290
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,920
I came to Paris and
began my 1st novel,

291
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,040
entitled The Seabed.

292
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,560
A kind of unstructured,
epic, chronicle of a family.

293
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,920
10 years on,
I abandoned The Seabed

294
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,840
? I was drowning in it ?,

295
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:55,760
to begin my new 1st novel,
At the Surface.

296
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,280
In At the Surface,
I found a style,

297
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,920
a way of telling a story
unique to me,

298
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,920
using material from my life

299
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,640
to generate emotion.

300
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,280
I received much encouragement.

301
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,000
The manuscript spoke.

302
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,000
But publishers wouldn't
touch At the Surface.

303
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,320
Its narrative was too experimental

304
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,480
and it didn't address
readers' concerns.

305
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,840
It was at this difficult time,

306
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,480
confronting serious doubts,
that I met Marie.

307
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:42,280
It was as if she came from
another planet: my planet.

308
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,000
That's how it felt
the first time I saw her.

309
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,760
A few weeks later,

310
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,040
Marie moved in with me.

311
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,120
I'd never shared
my life with anyone,

312
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,560
least of all a girl
who was 20 years my junior.

313
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,920
That's how it happened,
when I least expected it.

314
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:11,160
It's what we call
electro-hypersensitivity.

315
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,480
Electromagnetic fields
can deafen people.

316
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,280
In France, several hundred people

317
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,120
have been identified
as victims of this.

318
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,200
One day in April,

319
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,640
I heard a report on
electro-hypersensitivity.

320
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,880
...are hypersensitive to
electromagnetic fields,

321
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,840
around 2 million people.

322
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,760
I'd found the subject
of my next novel,

323
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,160
my last shot at becoming a writer.

324
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,480
I travelled to a white zone,

325
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,600
where victims of electro-sensitivity
syndrome had assembled.

326
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,360
Going there, I had no idea

327
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,320
just how much
it would change my life.

328
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,440
I expected to meet eccentrics.

329
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:57,360
I discovered deep,
complex individuals.

330
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,200
I went for few days.

331
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,920
I stayed for 2 months,

332
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,000
sharing their daily life,

333
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,440
living in a cave
with no electricity.

334
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,880
Returning wasn't easy.

335
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,640
I'd completed a
manuscript in record time.

336
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,920
Marie's interest was lukewarm.

337
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,440
I sent White Zone
off to publishers.

338
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,640
After a month of waiting,
I began to get migraines.

339
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,120
After eliminating various theories,

340
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,600
I faced facts:
I had electro-sensitivity syndrome.

341
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,760
I'd become electro-sensitive.

342
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,080
I renounced my
mobile phone and stereo.

343
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:41,280
I lined my apartment
with wave-shielding film.

344
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,160
We spent long weeks like this.

345
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,440
I didn't notice Marie
slipping away from me.

346
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,360
Then, one morning...

347
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,200
Hello?

348
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,760
Okay, I'll pass you over.
He's right...

349
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,880
Yes.

350
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,800
Just a moment.

351
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,120
Antoine?

352
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,200
It's for you.
It's important.

353
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,000
It was Marcel Messager,

354
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,480
an editor at
Des Foudres publishers.

355
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:35,000
He'd read White Zone
and was eager to meet me.

356
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,520
The novel came out in
September, writers' month.

357
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,840
It was a genuine success.

358
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,320
Oddly,
my hypersensitivity dropped

359
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,240
and then ceased to exist.

360
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,240
I had a phase of drunkenness.

361
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,960
At last, I was recognised.

362
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:53,160
"As my health began to
decline, he went crazy.

363
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,160
"He saw it as a bogus illness.

364
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,440
"I'd investigated it, as had we all.

365
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,440
"I knew I was electro-sensitive.

366
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,560
"But it was nonsense to him.

367
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,880
"He forced me to continue training.
So I fled,

368
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,960
"like a criminal. See?

369
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,880
"I took refuge in the forest.
Imagine it.

370
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,960
"I was damn well homeless.

371
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,040
"Living in Bois de Vincennes."

372
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,760
I fell on tough times.

373
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,760
I realised that I'd ruined

374
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,160
the one great love affair
of my life.

375
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,320
The wave of success subsided,

376
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,600
I sank back into oblivion,

377
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,880
and writing my next novel

378
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,040
felt completely out of my reach.

379
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,600
A whiskey.

380
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,120
Japanese.

381
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,480
There you go. No ice.

382
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,040
Can't sleep either?

383
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,440
Oscar?

384
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,760
It's not my fault.

385
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,040
Is that you puss-cat?

386
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,720
- Morning.
- Morning.

387
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,480
What's got into you?

388
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,040
- Don't you remember?
- No.

389
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,760
What should I remember?

390
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,040
Daddy.

391
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,040
Hi. Sorry.

392
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,760
- Cooee.
- Cooee.

393
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,200
You look great.

394
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,480
- And how are you?
- I'm alright.

395
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,200
Got a job?

396
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,840
Um... no.
Nothing special. Stringers.

397
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,920
Oscar's a sleepwalker.

398
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,200
See you later.

399
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,880
- 3 pm, okay?
- On the dot.

400
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,560
- Can we see a movie?
- You want to?

401
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,920
What's a sleepwalker?

402
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,200
Someone who rises in the night...

403
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,480
- You've seen it before?
- No.

404
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,920
What film shall we see?

405
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,080
- I don't know.
- Oh! I know a cool one!

406
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,200
What are you doing?
Let me see.

407
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,760
Hold on a second.

408
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,440
- Was she having sex?
- What?

409
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,280
Was the girl having sex?

410
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,640
Look.

411
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,280
That's a famous artist.

412
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,720
Wonderful self-portraits.

413
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,360
- Do you know what they are?
- No.

414
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,200
It's like drawing yourself,

415
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,000
like drawing your own face.

416
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,920
Hello, I can't talk much.

417
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,440
Then I'll keep it, okay?

418
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,760
I'm working.

419
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,920
Right now I'm working.

420
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,360
Oh, shit!
I completely forgot.

421
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,200
I'm coming.

422
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,360
Tell him I'll be there soon.

423
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,720
I'm sorry.
I won't be long.

424
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,200
She leaves him, unceremoniously.

425
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,040
So he hits a rough patch

426
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,080
and starts drinking again,

427
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,760
not to the point of addiction.

428
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,200
He drinks moderately,

429
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,920
but frequently.

430
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,280
He's bored.

431
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,560
He thinks he's ruined
his one true love,

432
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,600
that he should have fought for.

433
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:28,040
That's when he decides
to reach out to her again

434
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,200
via an intermediary character:

435
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,280
Simeon,

436
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,880
who I'm fleshing out.

437
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,200
This guy comes out of
nowhere and meets Marie.

438
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,160
It's love at first sight.

439
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,440
Fireworks,

440
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,080
which saddens Victor.

441
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,480
More sad than jealous.

442
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:53,280
Sad and angry, to be precise.

443
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:56,000
He stalks him.
It's an obsession.

444
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,880
The guy has a little girl.

445
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:05,360
A little mastermind who understands
everything about everything,

446
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,800
without being nauseating.

447
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:11,360
She has a heightened sensitivity.

448
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,320
I'm not eloquent.

449
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,920
On the contrary.

450
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,280
I don't want you thinking

451
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,560
it's going to be
cliché or provocative,

452
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:26,360
a kind of sick love triangle.

453
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:29,160
That's not the direction
I want to go in.

454
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,440
I get it.

455
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,360
You sound quite far advanced.

456
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,920
Yes.

457
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,640
Well, I think I am.

458
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,560
I'm just untying quite a few knots.

459
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,640
I mean, untangling lots of threads.

460
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,080
I'm breaking out of a deadlock.

461
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,520
That's great, that's great...

462
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,280
I'm sorry, Antoine,

463
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,080
but our time's up.

464
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,640
I have a meeting...

465
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,200
Of course.

466
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,640
Sorry for being so late.

467
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,200
My head's in the clouds.

468
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,080
I wanted to know whether...

469
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,520
you think it'd be
possible to have...

470
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,880
a small advance.

471
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,280
I'll let you know.

472
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,080
In the bedroom,
kitchen and lounge,

473
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,920
like in Paranormal Activity.

474
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,160
I'll start with the bedroom one.

475
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,520
Fast forward.

476
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,440
There won't be much on it.

477
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,080
Handsome dude, no?

478
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,880
I'll fast forward it.

479
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,080
Oh fuck!

480
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,960
Check another camera.

481
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,600
- Did you see what you did there?
- No.

482
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,280
No...

483
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,440
I'm not going to jump?

484
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,280
No, of course not.

485
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,360
You wouldn't be here now.

486
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,280
This is serious, man.
I'm going to jump.

487
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,200
"Sleepwalking can be safe,

488
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,200
"like sitting on a bed
or cleaning objects,

489
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:06,400
"or dangerous, like cooking,
driving, raping or causing death.

490
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,520
"In 2004, Australian
experts treated a woman

491
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,600
"who had sex with
strangers while asleep."

492
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,600
Oh fuck!

493
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,240
"In 2008, reports say

494
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,160
"a woman sent ridiculous
emails in her sleep."

495
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,280
See you later.

496
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,520
Oh fuck!

497
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,800
Sarah loved walking home

498
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,680
via Pere-Lachaise cemetery
with her father.

499
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,360
He enjoyed it too.

500
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:45,080
He found it a playful
and intelligent way

501
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,520
of introducing great men and women.

502
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,480
He thought of them there,

503
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,520
six feet under,

504
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,720
the community they made,
despite themselves.

505
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,440
The girl's mother
strongly opposed it.

506
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:01,720
"You don't take a
6 year old into a cemetery",

507
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,520
she'd scolded one day

508
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,960
after he'd had a
foolish urge to confess.

509
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,280
Lying

510
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,440
was Simeon's main flaw.

511
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,280
His second greatest flaw,

512
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,240
which some of his friends
saw as a strength,

513
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,440
was his determination.

514
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:23,400
Simeon was a profoundly
determined being.

515
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,520
"Stubborn"

516
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,720
was how his mother put it.

517
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,360
Are you a detective?

518
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,640
Yeah.

519
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,920
I thought so.

520
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,400
You're tailing someone?

521
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,280
Yes.

522
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,160
Cool.

523
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,000
What kind of case is it?

524
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,520
A missing person.

525
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,280
A murder?

526
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,720
Cool.

527
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,720
- Shit!
- What?

528
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,840
She's leaving.

529
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,440
- Are you parked nearby?
- Just over there.

530
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,520
I need to seize your vehicle.

531
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,640
- Quick.
- I'll drive, extra helmet.

532
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,440
Is she escaping?

533
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,520
Here.

534
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,880
- Thanks for cooperating.
- No problem.

535
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,000
Good luck.
Be careful.

536
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,880
TGV 621 is now departing.

537
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:50,680
Please climb aboard
and do not block the doors...

538
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,440
What do you want?

539
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,400
Hasn't she gone?

540
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,680
Who?

541
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,880
The girl.

542
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,520
What girl?

543
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,520
I took your colleague
to the station by scooter.

544
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,600
What colleague?

545
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,160
You're not a detective?

546
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,600
I am.

547
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,240
How'd you know?

548
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,160
What's this colleague stuff?

549
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,880
You mean he wasn't a cop?

550
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,440
Right...

551
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:48,320
Tell me everything
from the beginning.

552
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,320
I came in before and saw
a guy sitting like you...

553
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,320
At Lorient, Marie took a taxi.

554
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:11,680
She got out at the wharf
for Groix Island.

555
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,400
"Whoever sees Groix, sees their joy."

556
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:19,440
I'd travelled a long way
and I deserved a little joy.

557
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,240
So I boarded too,

558
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,720
not knowing where it would take me.

559
00:41:52,360 --> 00:42:04,600
Hello.

560
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,040
Is there a room free?

561
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,680
You want to sleep here?

562
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,320
It is a hotel.

563
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,120
Yes, of course.

564
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,400
Room 8.

565
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,400
Upstairs.

566
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,520
- Thanks.
- The stairs are there.

567
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,720
- Oscar?
- What are you doing? I'm waiting.

568
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,960
You won't believe me.

569
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,000
You found a job?

570
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,320
No, no.

571
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,400
I'm not in Paris.
I'm on Groix Island.

572
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,440
What island?

573
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,600
I followed the wallet girl.

574
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,400
What?

575
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,040
I followed Marie.

576
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,760
I'll take it.

577
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,320
This is your lovely house.

578
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,560
There's some local produce
to welcome you here.

579
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,040
You should have
everything you need.

580
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,560
Tonight's dinner
and tomorrow's breakfast.

581
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,240
I'm not seeing Cosmo?

582
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,560
No one told you?

583
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,120
Told me what?

584
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,400
Cosmo would rather see
you tomorrow morning.

585
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,280
He wants to save the
magic for tomorrow.

586
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:09,240
So, I'll leave you to it.

587
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,840
You've got my mobile number?

588
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:14,840
If you need anything, just call me.

589
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,400
We're just down a bit,
in the manor.

590
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,720
I'll pick you up at 5.30 am.

591
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,160
"5.30 in the morning"?

592
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:24,120
Early, to capture
the magic moment.

593
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:26,760
Have a great evening.

594
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,840
Good evening.

595
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,760
I was an early-winter baby.

596
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:08,880
My parents live in a village
in Bearn, in the Pyrenees.

597
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:11,320
They cultivate
our ancestors' land.

598
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,760
At least, my father

599
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,920
cultivates my mother's
ancestors' land.

600
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:18,760
Days after my birth,

601
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,560
the priest begged my parents
to let me be baby Jesus

602
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,200
in the nativity scene
he was making.

603
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:26,680
It would be great.

604
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,600
You couldn't find a boy?

605
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,840
That's how I changed sex

606
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,280
and got my first big role
before an emotive crowd.

607
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:40,400
At 7, I was devastated
by the death of Gedeon,

608
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,920
a white duck I'd won at
a fair in a nearby village.

609
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:47,000
I declared that all my life

610
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,400
I'd be strongly opposed
to the concept of death.

611
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:52,640
At 10,

612
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:56,600
I began to wonder if I was
really related to my family.

613
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:00,880
At 17, I decided to
leave the family nest

614
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:05,000
to avoid, despite my
expressed opposition to death,

615
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,040
strangling my father.

616
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:10,040
I went to Bordeaux with

617
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,200
Leonard, my current boyfriend.

618
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:19,120
Still as cute as ever.

619
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,840
And you're a spaniel?

620
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,480
A smiley spaniel.

621
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,040
Little mouse, cooee.

622
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,200
Mouse, the mouse.

623
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:36,040
In Bordeaux, I discovered
the joys of urban life.

624
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,840
I loved dancing, drinking,

625
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:40,400
physical love and chemical drugs.

626
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,920
- Okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

627
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,480
Yeah, okay, okay.

628
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:56,920
Sorry.

629
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,600
Great evening.

630
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:06,280
Yeah, it's brilliant, so good.

631
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:08,200
Happy birthday, Marie.

632
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,400
How do you know my name?

633
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,560
Have we met before?

634
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:19,880
Here.

635
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:23,640
Open it.

636
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,120
This is my present to you.

637
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:37,160
A little pill.

638
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:46,000
You're leaving?

639
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:37,760
From that moment on,

640
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:41,280
I became the odd ball
that I am today.

641
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:43,760
After that night,

642
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:47,000
it started to sometimes feel like

643
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:50,560
life stopped abruptly
for a few seconds,

644
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,280
or that at least I was gone.

645
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:00,040
I decided to change
my life and town,

646
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,120
abandon my law studies,

647
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:05,160
leave Bordeaux, Leonard,
and move to Paris.

648
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,440
The rents were sky high
so I replied to an ad.

649
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:11,840
Suzanne entered my life.

650
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:14,560
You're very pretty.

651
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:18,880
You must get that a lot.

652
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:21,440
Not so much.

653
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:23,600
The world is cruel,

654
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,000
people are blind.

655
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:29,040
You know,

656
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:34,800
I hardly ever go out.
I have everything I need, here.

657
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,320
I have my memories,

658
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:37,840
my books, my paintings.

659
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:39,720
What would I do outside?

660
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,440
You can move in when you want.

661
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,600
That is, if you like the room.

662
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:51,840
Really?

663
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:53,800
Live how you choose,

664
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:55,800
do what you have to do.

665
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,680
I just need to know
that you're not far from me.

666
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:03,840
She was a former actress,
shepherdess, teacher,

667
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,680
photographer, hotel maid,

668
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,600
American artist's model.

669
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:10,240
Married 3 times,
didn't want children.

670
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,960
He was still young...

671
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:16,040
She talked about the
departed she'd loved,

672
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,720
about weariness

673
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:20,120
and a sense of having lived enough.

674
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:21,680
After a while,

675
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:26,400
it's like an injustice,
still being in the world.

676
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:28,000
Don't you think?

677
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:30,960
Yes, maybe.

678
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:31,960
I lied.

679
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:36,320
I don't know how you can
think about your own death.

680
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:39,240
You know, Suzanne?

681
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,120
You're my 1st female friend.

682
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,560
My 1st real girlfriend.

683
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:49,760
Suzanne introduced me to Balthazar,

684
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,840
a top fashion photographer.

685
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:55,520
I compiled a portfolio and
joined a modelling agency.

686
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,840
Offers kept coming in,

687
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:03,040
until the day I agreed to appear
in a perfume commercial.

688
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:04,960
I found myself half naked,

689
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:08,000
kissing some guy
who looked like a cyborg.

690
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:11,960
Cut.

691
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:18,200
I decided to stop
making a living that way.

692
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,400
I started babysitting.

693
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:26,960
Babies are strange creatures to me.

694
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,960
They seem to suffer constantly.

695
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:32,000
You didn't ask to be born.

696
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,120
Feel resentful?

697
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,120
Then one night...

698
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:48,560
Okay Suzanne?

699
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:00,960
Suzanne?

700
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:09,680
Suzanne was cremated
at Pere-Lachaise cemetery.

701
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:13,560
Why's she sad?

702
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:16,840
I left the funeral alone.
I didn't know anyone.

703
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:19,960
It felt like...

704
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,840
Suzanne had been a mystery.

705
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,120
She'd passed like a shadow.

706
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,680
I think...

707
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:31,560
my purpose was
to be there when she died

708
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:33,840
and she planned it that way.

709
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,000
I was angry at her.

710
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,000
Then I forgave her.

711
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:47,120
I lived in a hotel,
waiting for a break.

712
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:48,680
I needed money,

713
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:52,400
so I decided to return to modelling.

714
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:54,120
While I waited for offers,

715
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:55,280
I slept all day

716
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:59,280
and walked all night,
brainstorming about my future.

717
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:02,200
This was when I met Antoine,

718
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,280
a beautiful person.

719
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:06,400
Beautiful and sad.

720
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,120
It's written on his face.

721
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:33,280
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

722
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,360
It's late, you don't know me,

723
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:37,000
but can I come in?

724
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:39,000
You need to tell me more.

725
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,560
I don't let strangers
in after midnight.

726
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,120
It's 11.45 pm.

727
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,920
It doesn't matter.
I'll tell you more.

728
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:53,200
It's about your friend.
It's important.

729
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:05,920
Do you have any liquor?
Whiskey?

730
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:08,000
- Japanese.
- "Japanese"?

731
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:09,120
Japanese.

732
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:12,640
- I've got Irish whiskey.
- That'll do just fine.

733
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,840
Have a seat.
Make yourself at home.

734
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,280
What's the camera for?

735
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:26,000
For filming me at night.

736
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,720
I sleepwalk.

737
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:31,640
It's quite new. I tape it.

738
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:33,560
- Can I see?
- What?

739
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:34,920
The footage.

740
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:37,120
No, it's personal.

741
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:40,120
That's a pity.

742
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,280
Sorry, there's no ice.

743
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:45,440
I don't mind.

744
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:49,120
Are you the one who's been calling?

745
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:53,280
I thought so.

746
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,080
What was that about Simeon?

747
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:59,000
- Tell me where he is.
- Why?

748
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,720
- We need to talk.
- About what?

749
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:01,840
It's personal.

750
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:05,360
- Why would I tell you?
- You know where he is?

751
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:08,840
Maybe.

752
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:10,560
Where is he?

753
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,560
Help yourself.

754
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,440
Wow, those are big.

755
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:26,000
Right...

756
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,440
I'll level with you.

757
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:30,920
Marie was my girlfriend,

758
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:35,000
the girl whose wallet Simeon found.

759
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:38,280
We split up recently.

760
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:41,280
I'm pretty sure he's following her.

761
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:46,280
I know she took a train,
but I don't know where to.

762
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,280
So, I want to know:

763
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:51,280
1) where they've gone,

764
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:53,440
2) Simeon's intentions,

765
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:57,800
and 3) if I can see your
sleepwalking footage.

766
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,080
You're a guy...

767
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:05,720
who's very...

768
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:08,560
You're really weird.

769
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:12,160
You don't seem very nice at first,

770
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:15,840
but you have a kind of
perseverance that makes you...

771
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:16,800
likable.

772
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:23,280
There's something
else I have to tell you.

773
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:28,840
The reason I'm here
is because your friend...

774
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,280
is in danger.

775
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:31,800
In what way?

776
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:33,720
Marie is dangerous.

777
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,280
"Dangerous"? But...

778
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,080
How is she dangerous?

779
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:39,440
Just dangerous.

780
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:45,720
What are you doing?

781
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:50,280
I've decided to
show you the footage.

782
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:05,440
That was last night.

783
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:07,520
Now I'm scared to fall asleep.

784
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:11,280
I've been drinking
coffee to stay awake.

785
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:13,880
It's fascinating.

786
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
You think so?

787
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:18,600
When I was a teenager,

788
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:22,880
I wrote a short story called
Sleepwalker Love.

789
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,160
What was it about?

790
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:28,600
The story of a guy and a girl,

791
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:30,520
both sleepwalkers.

792
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:34,160
They only love
each other at night.

793
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,080
- And how does it end?
- Badly.

794
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:39,280
Very badly.

795
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,240
One night,
they leave town

796
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,440
to live their love far away.

797
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:50,320
They walk along the train track,

798
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:53,000
a symbol of their freedom.

799
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:56,720
They walk together, hand in hand.

800
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:58,720
A train approaches,

801
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:01,520
but they don't hear it coming.

802
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:03,000
They keep walking.

803
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:05,800
The train gets closer,

804
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:06,880
closer...

805
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:09,600
and bam!

806
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:13,160
The train hits them
and they die in their sleep.

807
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:18,880
Right...

808
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:23,000
I'll tell you where Simeon is.

809
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,800
On one condition.

810
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:28,600
I'm listening.

811
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:30,720
I come with you.

812
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:38,440
It's a deal.

813
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:43,160
Don't tell Simeon we're coming.

814
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:44,800
Why not?

815
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,320
It'd be dangerous.

816
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:54,440
Promise?

817
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,600
Promise.

818
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:58,600
Until tomorrow.

819
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:00,560
8 am, Montparnasse Station.

820
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:21,320
Going to Sandy Bay?

821
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:23,000
Do you recommend it?

822
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:25,320
If you come here, you have to.

823
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:26,960
It's convex.

824
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:28,320
"Convex"?

825
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:31,280
Europe's only convex beach.

826
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:34,880
Instead of being like this,
it's like this.

827
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:36,680
And it's moving.

828
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:40,760
10 years ago, it was by the village.

829
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,760
Now it's on the other
side of the lighthouse.

830
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,720
So the holiday village has
rocks instead of a beach.

831
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:52,000
- That's funny.
- Is it true?

832
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:53,600
There's the Hell Hole.

833
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:55,400
- "Hell Hole"?
- Yeah.

834
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:56,680
Okay.

835
00:59:58,720 --> 00:59:59,880
I'll go tomorrow.

836
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:02,440
My great grandfather was a member

837
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:05,720
of the first lifesaving service.

838
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:08,040
- Have you heard about it?
- No.

839
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:09,720
Back then, in Groix,

840
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:13,280
there were lots of rescue boats.

841
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:16,880
- It was Rescue Island.
- "Rescue Island"?

842
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:18,680
Why did you come?

843
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:22,160
- I followed a girl.
- You followed a girl?

844
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:23,760
Hoping what?

845
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:43,280
What's she doing in Lorient?

846
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:46,720
It's not Lorient.

847
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:50,040
Where is it then?

848
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:52,680
It's Groix.

849
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:55,480
Fuck, that's an island.

850
01:01:58,360 --> 01:01:59,960
We have to take a boat.

851
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:02,760
Yes, that happens
a lot with islands.

852
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:05,280
Last time, I was 6.

853
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:10,040
Just the idea of getting
on a boat terrifies me.

854
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:16,200
I'm going to have a nap.

855
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:18,120
I didn't sleep a wink.

856
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:40,320
When my wife left,
I almost got into trouble.

857
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:42,400
Sorry?

858
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:44,880
I looked at my son.
He smiled.

859
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:48,320
I wondered: "What will
he think if you leave him?"

860
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:51,160
Do you have kids?

861
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:52,600
No.

862
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:54,040
Never wanted any.

863
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:57,880
What would they do
with a father like me ?

864
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:00,000
They're not missing much.

865
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:10,760
The next boat leaves in 15 minutes.

866
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:16,480
Do you think about death much?

867
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:17,720
No.

868
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:20,440
I mean...

869
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:22,200
not your own death,

870
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:24,760
the idea of causing it,

871
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:26,000
killing someone.

872
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,400
How many did you take?

873
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:33,200
Cut. Great.
We got what we want.

874
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:36,880
Have a seat there.

875
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:45,880
You know,

876
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:50,000
this video clip portrays
my primordial scene,

877
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:52,080
my founding moment.

878
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:55,080
It happened here on this beach,

879
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:57,160
Europe's only convex beach.

880
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:01,280
It's like this. You see?

881
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:02,880
It's strange, isn't it?

882
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:04,760
Yes.

883
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:08,200
What happened to you?

884
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:10,640
Wait, I'm going there.

885
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:13,000
It was the summer of 2013.

886
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:14,920
I'd just finished filming.

887
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:17,360
I'd decided to take a break.

888
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:19,560
I never take holidays.

889
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:22,360
To me, holidays are like dying.

890
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:25,440
But my body was telling me to.

891
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:26,880
I have a rule:

892
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:29,640
when your body speaks,
you must listen.

893
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:31,640
So I came to this island.

894
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:34,920
Nowell, my partner,
have a family home here.

895
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:38,560
I'd never been.
I didn't even know it existed.

896
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:42,200
We'd arrived the previous
day, eaten and drunk.

897
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:43,800
It was a lovely day.

898
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:47,800
Nowell brought me to
the beach and immediately

899
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:50,080
I felt odd vibrations.

900
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:53,480
I felt good.
There weren't many people.

901
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:55,640
We got out our towels

902
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:57,720
and lay down on the sand...

903
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:01,360
I'd never done that before.

904
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:07,000
My body started to go numb.
It was strange.

905
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:10,280
Strange, but not unpleasant.
Quite the opposite.

906
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:12,600
That was the moment I left it.

907
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:15,320
Left what?

908
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:18,320
Left my body.
There were two of us.

909
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:22,080
I saw it lying there on
the beach, next to Nowell.

910
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:24,480
I had left that bodily form.

911
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:27,480
I looked at myself like a stranger.

912
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:34,480
That's when I turned
towards the sea and saw you.

913
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:41,200
How did you see me?

914
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:45,640
I saw the sea maiden
in a dreamlike light.

915
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:49,520
When I started to make the video,

916
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:53,480
I searched actresses' faces
for one that looked like her.

917
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:56,240
And when I discovered
your perfume ad,

918
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:58,080
I couldn't believe my eyes.

919
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:02,040
- You know, the one that...
- Yeah, yeah, I know the one.

920
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:05,320
Even now, I feel troubled
when I look at you.

921
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:09,440
You have to lose the girlfriend.

922
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:12,240
She doesn't love you.

923
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:14,480
She loves your fame.

924
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:16,360
You don't love her either.

925
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:18,240
Not truly.

926
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:21,080
You just like sleeping with her.

927
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:27,440
- What are you doing?
- Shut up, I'm concentrating.

928
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:38,240
Where did she go?

929
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:41,200
Now, I'm going to dress you,

930
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:44,480
to make you look
a little less hillbilly.

931
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:45,920
"Hillbilly"?

932
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:49,440
What's this madness?

933
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:50,800
That's better!

934
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:55,360
Right... come on, do like me.

935
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:01,360
Come on, do like me.

936
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:09,200
So I did what the sea maiden asked.

937
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:10,800
I raised my arms

938
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:14,320
and it was like being reborn.

939
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:17,920
Like becoming someone else.
That was the reality.

940
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:20,800
I became someone else.

941
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:25,480
From now on,

942
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:27,920
your name is Cosmo.

943
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:29,360
"Cosmo"?

944
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:30,960
Yes, Cosmo.

945
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:34,920
Like the cosmos,
without the second 's'.

946
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:36,200
Next,

947
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:40,080
you'll stop making
such cynical music,

948
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:43,160
which doesn't suit you at all.

949
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:45,600
You'll move into electronic music.

950
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:48,520
But I know nothing about it.

951
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:51,640
You'll learn.
You're no dumber than anyone.

952
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:54,040
And you're a true musician.

953
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:57,040
You need to be braver.

954
01:09:57,240 --> 01:09:58,320
Get keyboards.

955
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:00,320
- "Keyboards"?
- Yes.

956
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:03,600
Keyboards, drum
machines and a good beat.

957
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:06,760
And start writing abstract lyrics

958
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:08,760
that only you understand.

959
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:11,640
They'll evoke images

960
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:14,720
that belong to you alone

961
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:16,240
and are deeply moving.

962
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,480
You'll come here to film
the video to your first single,

963
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:23,520
from your first album,

964
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:25,240
from your new career.

965
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:29,360
It will be about today.

966
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:31,680
Then you disappeared

967
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:34,200
and I found myself alone,

968
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:36,160
planted there like an idiot.

969
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:39,040
So that's what happened.

970
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:45,760
What are you...?

971
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:49,160
But... I don't understand.
How...?

972
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:50,640
You followed me.

973
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:53,480
- You know each other?
- No.

974
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:57,520
- You are...
- Cosmo.

975
01:10:57,720 --> 01:10:59,080
Didn't recognise you.

976
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:01,360
Simeon.

977
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:02,520
- Cosmo?
- Yeah?

978
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:05,160
Let's find shelter.
The rain's coming.

979
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:06,480
Come on.

980
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:17,480
This is good.

981
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:19,920
Go on, have a seat.

982
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:26,800
Tequila, rum...

983
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:29,240
vodka...

984
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:31,520
Serve yourselves.

985
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:50,240
Never forget your roots,

986
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:52,080
who you were before.

987
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:53,840
I look at that every day.

988
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:57,400
Now, a little vodka for me.

989
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:01,120
- One for you too?
- Yes, thanks.

990
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:04,120
That's good.

991
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:07,600
Go on, speak.

992
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:11,200
You must have so much to say.
Pretend we're not here.

993
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:20,600
I'll try to explain.

994
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:26,560
I went back to the
bar where we met.

995
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:29,280
I waited for you.

996
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:32,040
I wanted to talk to you.

997
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:35,280
What are you doing?
Where are you?

998
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:37,640
Oh, that...

999
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:41,760
The taxi arrived
and stole my thunder.

1000
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,440
I know what you mean.

1001
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:45,880
Go on, I'm listening.

1002
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:49,760
Then, I followed you to the station,

1003
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:51,880
I hopped on the train,

1004
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:53,200
then on the boat.

1005
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:55,160
It's all very factual.

1006
01:12:56,480 --> 01:13:00,320
Tell her how you're
feeling right now, deep down.

1007
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:01,560
You only live once.

1008
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:03,760
Mustn't miss these moments.

1009
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:05,040
For example,

1010
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:08,440
if I hadn't taken a chance
on the beach that day,

1011
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:09,720
with Marie,

1012
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:12,040
I mean the sea maiden,

1013
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:14,560
I would have ended up miserable

1014
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:17,320
and phony, a soulless musician

1015
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:19,640
obsessed with his own image.

1016
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:22,640
There's a Chinese proverb:

1017
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:26,200
"You can't look at the stars
while you are walking

1018
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:28,000
"with a stone in your shoe."

1019
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:29,760
Well, I had a big stone

1020
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,480
in my shoe before I met

1021
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:34,360
the sea maiden.

1022
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:39,040
Cosmo, I think you had heat stroke,

1023
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:43,360
intense heat stroke
that made you hallucinate.

1024
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:46,000
You don't mean that.

1025
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:52,640
The rain's stopped.
I'll go get changed.

1026
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:55,600
Want us to remove your makeup?

1027
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:56,800
No, I can do it.

1028
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,080
- Coming with me?
- Yes.

1029
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:03,160
Hang on.
The big wrap party's tonight.

1030
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,600
Did you distribute the flyers?

1031
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:07,640
I did it during the break.

1032
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:09,720
Coming? I'm counting on you.

1033
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:12,480
Yeah.

1034
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:15,640
See you later.

1035
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:34,080
It's me.

1036
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:38,360
I've got something weird
to tell you. A bit late now.

1037
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:42,480
It all happened so fast.
Please don't be mad at me.

1038
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:45,720
So.

1039
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:49,040
I'm on a boat

1040
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:52,480
heading for the island with
that girl's ex-boyfriend.

1041
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:55,000
I'll explain later.

1042
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:59,280
According to him, she's dangerous,

1043
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:00,800
and he...

1044
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:04,200
I've got to go.

1045
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:08,440
- Oh, shit!
- Are you okay?

1046
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:10,920
- It's all moving.
- Come get some air.

1047
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:23,440
I feel so bad.

1048
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:25,800
Don't resist the sea.

1049
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:29,360
Go with the wave,
like a floating bottle.

1050
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:36,800
Look.

1051
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:39,440
There's the island.

1052
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:56,360
We've made it.

1053
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:07,600
What Cosmo said wasn't so dumb.

1054
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:08,920
What did he say?

1055
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:11,720
He said...

1056
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:13,520
you only live once.

1057
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:17,320
He talked about stars and
having a stone in your shoe.

1058
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:22,800
The metaphor didn't inspire me.

1059
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:23,800
Marie?

1060
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,080
Yes?

1061
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:40,080
I remember now.

1062
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:43,440
- What?
- The first time I saw you.

1063
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:47,440
I was with my daughter
at Pere-Lachaise.

1064
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:50,480
She asked me why you were sad.

1065
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:34,520
Thanks for returning my wallet.

1066
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:36,640
No problem.

1067
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:45,920
Can you help me with...?

1068
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:52,640
Look.

1069
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:54,680
Look how beautiful it is.

1070
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:56,080
It's beautiful.

1071
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:14,360
I got anxious.

1072
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:16,600
I was ridiculous. Sorry.

1073
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:22,520
Look.

1074
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:24,080
This hotel's not bad.

1075
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:28,960
We have to sleep here.
The next ferry's tomorrow.

1076
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:30,240
Let's go then.

1077
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,480
The Jetty Hotel

1078
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:38,960
- Hello.
- Hello.

1079
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:40,160
Hello.

1080
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:52,360
Two rooms please.

1081
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,760
- What?
- Two rooms.

1082
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:58,520
Thank you.

1083
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:06,680
It's upstairs.
The stairs are there.

1084
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:08,160
Right, thanks.

1085
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:12,200
We'll meet here once
I've collected myself.

1086
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:14,200
Don't do anything without me.

1087
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:16,240
Can I trust you?

1088
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:17,800
- Promise?
- Promise.

1089
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:27,520
- A party ?
- Yes.

1090
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:45,520
The crossing was gruelling.

1091
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:49,760
Victor had to fight his demons
in order to reach the island.

1092
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:52,480
Simeon and Marie
arrived the day before,

1093
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:54,960
separately.

1094
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:58,800
Victor didn't know
whether they'd met up.

1095
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,680
Neither did he know
Simeon's intentions.

1096
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:04,960
He wasn't even sure of his own.

1097
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:21,960
Why had he come to this island?

1098
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:24,680
How would it all end?

1099
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:26,960
He felt capable of anything.

1100
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:30,960
Unsettling urges
were rising from within.

1101
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:35,440
He rested in his room
at the Jetty Hotel,

1102
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:38,440
fighting off the images
infecting his mind.

1103
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:45,160
He thought about The Jetty, a film

1104
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:47,240
that he'd seen with Marie.

1105
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:50,240
Victor remembered
the voice-over:

1106
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:56,240
"This is the story of a man, marked
by an image from his childhood."

1107
01:20:57,800 --> 01:21:01,160
But soon the parasitic images
returned to haunt him.

1108
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:25,600
Today, at 3.53 pm.

1109
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:26,960
Yes, it's me.

1110
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:31,880
I've got something weird to tell you.
A bit late now.

1111
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:35,240
It all happened so fast.
Please don't be mad at me.

1112
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:38,760
Today, at 5.04 pm.

1113
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:42,080
Why don't you pick up?

1114
01:21:42,240 --> 01:21:43,920
We just got to the island.

1115
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:45,680
We're staying at the hotel...

1116
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:48,400
- What's the name again?
- The Jetty Hotel.

1117
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:51,800
The Jetty Hotel.
It's really nice.

1118
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:55,560
Call me back when you get this.
I don't know what to do.

1119
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:57,960
The guy I came with

1120
01:21:58,160 --> 01:22:00,840
is a bit unstable.

1121
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:04,560
So, call me back. Oscar.

1122
01:22:05,240 --> 01:22:08,120
End of new messages.
To listen to your...

1123
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:29,840
- You're not going to answer?
- No.

1124
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:32,280
- Are you writing?
- Yes.

1125
01:22:32,440 --> 01:22:33,880
Right...

1126
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:35,480
What do we do now?

1127
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:38,160
I have to find Marie.

1128
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:42,600
They told me Simeon got here
last night and has a room here.

1129
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:46,240
There's a party tonight.

1130
01:22:46,440 --> 01:22:48,960
The wrap party for a music video.

1131
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:52,400
I feel like a walk.

1132
01:22:54,120 --> 01:22:55,240
You're a genius.

1133
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:05,680
Wait for me.

1134
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:09,040
- Is it that way?
- Yes, straight ahead.

1135
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:16,160
Why are we going to the manor?

1136
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:17,840
Marie must be there.

1137
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,560
What makes you say that?

1138
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:22,280
She shot adverts
when we were together.

1139
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:24,680
I thought I'd seen her before.

1140
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:36,800
That's Simeon!

1141
01:24:09,320 --> 01:24:10,240
- Shit!
- Oscar?

1142
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:13,400
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

1143
01:24:13,640 --> 01:24:16,520
- You're not going to shoot me?
- Put your hands up.

1144
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:21,600
Don't you want to talk?

1145
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:23,600
I wanted to talk to you.

1146
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:25,760
About what?

1147
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:29,520
Quite frankly, I don't
think we have much to say.

1148
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:35,320
The location and
scenery are interesting.

1149
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:39,240
The light, the wind...

1150
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:40,880
The 3 of us are here.

1151
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:43,040
Marie's around somewhere...

1152
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:46,520
Why did you follow her?

1153
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:48,960
You said she's dangerous.

1154
01:24:49,160 --> 01:24:50,760
So?

1155
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:55,120
You court danger,
head down, no questions asked.

1156
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:58,280
Yes. I thought:
"What is a dangerous girl?"

1157
01:24:59,080 --> 01:25:01,320
It made me curious to see her.

1158
01:25:05,320 --> 01:25:06,520
A sound argument.

1159
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:15,480
Oscar.

1160
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:23,680
- What's all this?
- I'll explain.

1161
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:25,320
The bathroom's upstairs.

1162
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:26,880
Antoine?

1163
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:28,400
I can't believe it.

1164
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:35,240
- Who's that?
- That's Oscar.

1165
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:37,320
My flatmate.

1166
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:56,280
A pepper spray gun.
How stupid is that?

1167
01:25:56,920 --> 01:25:58,960
What a dumb idea to tackle me.

1168
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:01,120
As if I'd kill your best friend.

1169
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:04,960
Antoine?
You're such a weirdo.

1170
01:26:29,240 --> 01:26:30,200
You never said.

1171
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:33,480
- Are you in love with Marie?
- Oh please...

1172
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:37,240
I fell for you the moment
I saw you at the bus stop.

1173
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:39,960
Have you slept together?

1174
01:26:45,160 --> 01:26:47,120
Maybe...

1175
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:49,320
you two should talk one-to-one.

1176
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:52,480
Let's go have a smoke, Oscar.

1177
01:26:52,680 --> 01:26:54,840
But I quit smoking, Simeon.

1178
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:57,760
Come.

1179
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:02,120
Oscar.

1180
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:18,280
I was a jerk:
my electro-hypersensitivity

1181
01:27:19,680 --> 01:27:21,480
and my book launch.

1182
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:25,120
There's something
I wanted to say to you.

1183
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:27,160
I understand why you left me.

1184
01:27:28,040 --> 01:27:30,320
I would have done the same.

1185
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:32,000
I'd leave me.

1186
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:33,840
I'd have left me sooner.

1187
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:37,760
Don't you think the main thing

1188
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:39,720
is that we knew each other?

1189
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:44,960
We could have passed each
other by without ever meeting.

1190
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:47,680
Like if I hadn't been
at the bus stop.

1191
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:56,760
Are you okay?

1192
01:27:56,960 --> 01:27:58,560
Are you crying?

1193
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:03,320
I think it's the pepper spray.

1194
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:07,760
You've changed, Marie.

1195
01:28:09,480 --> 01:28:10,760
You're calmer.

1196
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:15,560
Is it because of this guy?

1197
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:18,280
Maybe.

1198
01:28:18,520 --> 01:28:22,320
Do you know he takes his daughter,
who's very young,

1199
01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:24,400
to cemeteries?

1200
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:27,040
Yes, I know.

1201
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:28,840
And to erotic films.

1202
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:32,560
I mean Korean films.

1203
01:28:36,280 --> 01:28:38,000
Are you writing again?

1204
01:28:38,840 --> 01:28:39,760
Yes.

1205
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:42,920
And? What's it about?

1206
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:46,840
I'd rather keep it secret for now.

1207
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:49,120
There's a moving convex beach.

1208
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:50,840
What's that nonsense?

1209
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:52,600
It's not nonsense.

1210
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:55,160
Speaking of strange movements,

1211
01:28:55,320 --> 01:28:57,040
are you still sleepwalking?

1212
01:28:58,120 --> 01:29:01,400
I haven't slept since yesterday.
So, I don't know.

1213
01:29:01,560 --> 01:29:04,440
But I did have a
conversation with myself.

1214
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:05,480
Really?

1215
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:08,920
When I was talking
to myself, I said:

1216
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:11,480
"Oscar, it's funny how

1217
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:14,000
"this sleepwalking business happens

1218
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:16,320
"right after you finish a piece."

1219
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:22,480
That gave me a boost to finish
and it gave me an idea.

1220
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:27,440
Look.

1221
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,560
I put it on YouTube.

1222
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:36,760
5 000 views already.

1223
01:30:05,840 --> 01:30:07,280
That's awesome!

1224
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:11,720
Bravo, Oscar.

1225
01:30:12,640 --> 01:30:16,360
You managed to make a hit
that's both sad and a dance tune.

1226
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:30,280
What's this?

1227
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:34,000
He's a cross between
that strange singer and Rael.

1228
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:39,440
- Good evening, Cosmo.
- So, my friend Simeon?

1229
01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:41,200
Do I have to fetch you?

1230
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:44,040
This is my best friend, Oscar,

1231
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:45,720
who's also a musician.

1232
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:47,440
Nice to meet you, Oscar.

1233
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:49,720
Likewise, Cosmo.

1234
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:04,640
Amazing.

1235
01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:06,600
Brilliantly mad.

1236
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:09,560
Go on.

1237
01:31:09,720 --> 01:31:11,200
Play it for them.

1238
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,280
- Go on.
- Really?

1239
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:15,080
No.
I can't play my music.

1240
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:16,720
Be daring!

1241
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:19,920
Alright then!

1242
01:31:20,120 --> 01:31:21,280
Over to you.

1243
01:31:36,280 --> 01:31:38,640
Marie? Simeon?

1244
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:45,320
Join us.

1245
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:50,000
Come on.

1246
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:04,560
Marie.

1247
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:10,080
Simeon.

1248
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:13,720
Antoine.

1249
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:09,080
Marie.

1250
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:10,320
What?

1251
01:33:10,520 --> 01:33:13,000
I'm going to stay here
to finish my book.

1252
01:33:13,200 --> 01:33:14,600
Are you sure?

1253
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:16,320
Yes.

1254
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:17,480
I have the title.

1255
01:33:17,680 --> 01:33:18,800
What is it called?

1256
01:33:19,080 --> 01:33:22,760
It's called Marie and the Castaways.

1257
01:35:26,360 --> 01:35:27,880
The next morning,

1258
01:35:28,040 --> 01:35:30,920
they walked along
Sandy Bay beach together,

1259
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:33,920
towards the Hell Hole.

1260
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:38,600
An evil thought
crossed Victor's mind.

1261
01:35:41,240 --> 01:35:43,320
Marie and Simeon left the island

1262
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:47,240
without Victor,
alone, with his story.

1263
01:36:12,440 --> 01:36:14,320
What happens next?

1264
01:39:51,200 --> 01:39:54,480
