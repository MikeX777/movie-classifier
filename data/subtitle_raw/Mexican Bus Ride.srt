1
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,077
ASCENT TO HEAVEN

2
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:45,154
<i>The only agricultural exploitation of this</i>
<i>town, which we will call San Jeronimito...</i>

3
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,149
<i>located on the coast of the state of</i>
<i>Guerrero, are coconut trees.</i>

4
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,708
<i>Oil is extracted from the white</i>
<i>coconut pith...</i>

5
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,354
<i>which is then used by several industries.</i>

6
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:01,238
<i>The occupants of these humble dwellings</i>
<i>are almost all wealthy...</i>

7
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,999
<i>owners of several</i>
<i>hundred palm trees.</i>

8
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,715
<i>The people of the coast maintain,</i>
<i>with their exaggerated charm...</i>

9
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,879
<i>that a coconut tree yields</i>
<i>as much as a milk cow.</i>

10
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,674
<i>There is no church in the village.</i>

11
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:19,077
<i>Thus, the inhabitants preserve...</i>

12
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,518
<i>their tradition of celebrating weddings</i>
<i>with a trip...</i>

13
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,911
<i>to a heavenly island situated one mile</i>
<i>off the coast.</i>

14
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,873
<i>Spending the night</i>
<i>on this deserted island...</i>

15
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,389
<i>consecrates the newlywed’s union...</i>

16
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:38,317
<i>who must then be forgiven by the bride’s</i>
<i>mother before embarking on the trip.</i>

17
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,952
<i>Let’s see the daily</i>
<i>arrival of the vehicle...</i>

18
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,790
<i>that brings news from the world</i>
<i>to this isolated corner.</i>

19
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,431
Careful, don’t touch that garment.

20
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,438
It has to be white.
Take care of it, Mrs. Linda.

21
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,552
Don’t worry, Silvestre.
I’ll take it.

22
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,151
Look, such lovely organdie endives.

23
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,353
It looks just like the dress
worn by Gen. Mendez’s daughter.

24
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:49,157
Yes, but you’d rather your daughter had worn
a rough cotton dress instead of eloping.

25
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,159
Go ahead, Mrs. Linda.
Albina must be dressed by now.

26
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,396
If you’re in such a hurry, go ahead.

27
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,192
I’ll pick up the train.

28
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,073
- Hurrah for the newlyweds.
- Hurrah.

29
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,191
Hurrah!

30
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,078
- Hurrah for the newlyweds.
- Hurrah.

31
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,189
Hurrah for the newlyweds.

32
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,192
- Hurrah for the newlyweds.
- Hurrah.

33
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,954
Hurrah for the newlyweds.

34
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,878
I have a mind to keep
you here all day.

35
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,839
If you think we’re happy,
you’re mistaken.

36
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,073
I doubt you can support yourself,
let alone a wife.

37
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,870
You’re both so young.

38
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,474
Come on, Mrs. Clara,
forgive them.

39
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,274
- Yes, yes.
- Forgive them.

40
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,872
The food’s getting cold,
we’re hungry.

41
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,918
Let them get up, woman.
Oliverio’s mother is ill.

42
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,430
I could keep them here
until they grow roots.

43
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,516
But...

44
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,474
You should thank God.
You can get up now.

45
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,272
Mother, I’m so happy.

46
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:24,228
I know Albina is your whole life.
I’ll try to be a worthy son to you.

47
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,999
I know you’ll be happy,
you have our blessings.

48
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,913
Go on, go. Go let the people in.

49
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,871
Come in, she forgave me.

50
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,871
Hurrah for the newlyweds!

51
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,871
Hurrah for the newlyweds.

52
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,789
Are you happy?

53
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,798
I am, Oliverio. I wouldn’t
trade places with anybody.

54
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,237
But a wedding in Mexico City
would have been nice.

55
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,354
And spending our honeymoon
at your mother’s house in Portales.

56
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,873
Will it ever be ours?

57
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,878
- Who knows.
- To have such a large house.

58
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,992
And spend our wedding night
on a desert island.

59
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,118
That’s the custom.

60
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,435
- I’m anxious to go.
- Me too.

61
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,992
With you, the island
is like a palace.

62
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,671
Get ready for the worst.
It’s Felipe, my brother.

63
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,394
Mother got worse. I said you shouldn’t
have gotten married today.

64
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,875
It was mother, she asked me to.

65
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,713
Thanks to that you may not see her alive.

66
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,831
Tie the boat and come.

67
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,878
If something terrible happens
we’ll have to decide about the property.

68
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,639
- Don’t say that now.
- It’s got to be said sometime.

69
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,671
I won’t give up my share.

70
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,952
Your soul is poisoned.
Making plans while mother is ill.

71
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,356
Don’t insult me.
I’m the eldest, I’ll decide.

72
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,308
- She’s still here to decide.
- What if she gives it all to the boy?

73
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,233
We’ll do what she decides.
It’s her call, isn’t it?

74
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,158
All right <i>Chuchito,</i> all right.
Go play, go on. Go play.

75
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,391
Are you feeling better, mother?

76
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,631
I won’t make it this time.

77
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,951
You have many years ahead.

78
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,834
But if something should happen,
God forbid...

79
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,951
trust me to settle the property.

80
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:45,119
- Did you think I’d fall that easy?
- I didn’t think anything, mother.

81
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,710
It’s just in case. You know I’m the son
who loves you the most.

82
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,269
Yes, I know. I know you.

83
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,073
You’re closing in.

84
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,756
I just want to fix things.
To solve this.

85
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,074
The big coconut tree field
can go to Felipe.

86
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:05,672
It’s fair to give Oliverio the boats and the
refrigerator, since he just got married.

87
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,791
The other field is for <i>Chuchito.</i>

88
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:14,390
I’ll settle for the little house in Portales.
Not because of what it’s worth.

89
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,114
I have aspirations
and want to move to the city.

90
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,109
Mother...
Mother, are you feeling worse?

91
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,431
No, but leave me alone.

92
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,469
Give that to me. How dare you?

93
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:44,554
Look. Such a straight face.
Get out, you’ll wake mother up.

94
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,875
And don’t come here anymore.

95
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,350
Oliverio, my son.

96
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,236
He’s getting married, forget him.

97
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,636
- Not quite, here I am.
- Thank God you’re here, son.

98
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,839
Juan, go do your chores.

99
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,037
You too, Felipe.

100
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,677
Albina... go look for <i>Chuchito.</i>

101
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,956
Leave me alone with Oliverio.

102
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,109
Yes, Mrs. Ester.

103
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,719
I’m sorry, son.

104
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,598
I interrupted your wedding night,
but I’m not feeling well.

105
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,359
Don’t say that,
you’ve been worse.

106
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,835
You know I won’t make it.

107
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,468
Come closer.

108
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:36,153
I know only you are fond of <i>Chuchito</i>
and you won’t let those thugs hurt him.

109
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,277
I want the house in Portales to be his.

110
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,712
He must go to school in the city,
be somebody.

111
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,829
Yes, mother.

112
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:48,959
Do it in memory of your sister
who died giving birth to him.

113
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:53,319
I’ll do it for you and for Chucho.
I love him as if he were my son.

114
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,994
But you should put it in writing.

115
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,395
My siblings won’t respect words.

116
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,910
Go fetch the delegate
to dictate my will.

117
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,754
I’m on it, mother.

118
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,669
<i>Chuchito.</i>

119
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,636
- Where are you going?
- I’ll be right back.

120
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,669
What will it be, Mr. Esteban?

121
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:35,034
I don’t mean to snub you, but
a delegate shouldn’t drink too much.

122
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,037
One for the road. Come on.

123
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,550
To drown our woes.
A mother cannot be replaced.

124
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:45,231
Don’t be a vulture, brother.
God willing, mother will survive.

125
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,670
I’ve always been strong.
Darling mother.

126
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,476
I can still see her
at the San Jose fair.

127
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,517
In such good health.

128
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,511
Hey, have you seen Eladio?

129
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:07,958
He was in my pocket a minute ago.
Not anymore. Look, he’s gone.

130
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,635
You’re hilarious.
He’s had me waiting for an hour.

131
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,115
A girl like you shouldn’t wait.

132
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,754
- Shall I help?
- Leave me alone.

133
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,274
Look who’s here. Where’s the bride?

134
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,755
- Hello, Raquel.
- A sight for sore eyes, Oliverio.

135
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,478
Have a drink.

136
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,471
It’s no time to party.

137
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,629
Mr. Esteban...

138
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,798
My mother wants a word with you.
Please, come.

139
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,832
What are you up to, evil son?
Disturbing her for your greed?

140
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:38,750
No brotherly quarrels.
You shouldn’t disturb her now.

141
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,669
I never evaded a lady’s call.
It’s my duty.

142
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,358
You’re not going.

143
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,838
Go away, take your wife with you.
You didn’t hesitate to get married now.

144
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,871
- Are you going or not?
- He isn’t.

145
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,595
Quiet.
I’m the authority, I’ll decide.

146
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,911
You’re the eldest, right?

147
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,474
- You don’t want me to go.
- No.

148
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,991
Then, I won’t. I’m staying.

149
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,509
You’ll be responsible if anything happens.

150
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:08,519
Sure, I’m responsible. What could happen?

151
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,829
Hey, Oliverio.

152
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,554
- What do you want?
- To talk.

153
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,189
Oliverio.

154
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,479
You took so long.

155
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,916
Isn’t Mr. Esteban coming?

156
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,717
I couldn’t find him.
He’s out of town for the week.

157
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,555
I feel terrible.
You look yellow to me.

158
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,990
Please Albina, the spoon.

159
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,108
Look, Oliverio.

160
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,914
Why wait for delegate Esteban?

161
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:52,996
Go to Petatlan and bring Counsellor Figueroa
to draw up will.

162
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,276
Why go so far, mother?

163
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,755
Counsellor Ocana is in Acapulco.

164
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,353
It’s not the same.

165
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,355
Counsellor Figueroa took charge
since your father.

166
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,118
And in the meantime?

167
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,469
Don’t worry.

168
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,435
I’ll be strong enough to wait.

169
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,071
Go, and don’t tell your siblings.

170
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,159
All right, mother.

171
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,759
The bus leaves at six.

172
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,552
Take a nap, son.

173
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,030
I also want to get some rest.

174
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,556
Yes, Oliverio.
Go to sleep. I’ll wake you up.

175
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,352
- Let’s go to Petatlan together.
- Stay and take care of mother.

176
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,479
What if something happens?

177
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,353
Nothing will happen,
I’ll be back as soon as I can.

178
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,352
- Oliverio.
- What?

179
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:08,350
Take my mirror.
Don’t break it, it’s bad luck.

180
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,757
- It’s safe here.
- Let’s see if it’s true.

181
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,873
- A cigarette, doll.
- Yes, Congressman. Thank you.

182
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,758
Come here.

183
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,029
Oh, boy.

184
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,275
Now me, Silvestre, now me.

185
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,636
You’re acting like a child.

186
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,155
I can’t play with you
the same way.

187
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,594
Careful, with the lady.

188
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,915
- Hey, Silvestre.
- Well, well.

189
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,156
It’s about time.
When is the baby due?

190
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,508
I’m going to Petatlan...

191
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,471
-...to see Dr. Martinez?
- Yes, sir.

192
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,272
He’s one of the best.

193
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,237
- Are you travelling, too?
- Yes.

194
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,516
You shouldn’t, should you, Feliza?

195
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,069
After what happened
to your sister Jacinta.

196
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,191
I’m here if you need anything.

197
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,356
- Thanks.
- Careful, careful.

198
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,992
- I’m going with your mother.
- Wait until the bus leaves.

199
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,872
It won’t until it fills up.

200
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,073
- When one’s in a hurry, things stall.
- Don’t worry, I’ll look after her.

201
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,872
Good-bye, my dear.

202
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,039
- You’re so corny, Oli.
- Is that envy or a compliment?

203
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,199
- Envy? I have them by the dozen.
- Influential, like me.

204
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,198
Ha.
I like ripe fruit, not rotten.

205
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,392
- Your influence just wilted.
- You’ll see.

206
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,037
I want to see my granddaughter.
Can I pay when I get back?

207
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,357
- You know I always say yes, Mr. Nemesio.
- Everything’s on paper.

208
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:37,476
When justice is finally done in Mexico and I
get my land back, I’ll pay you every penny.

209
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,797
- Much obliged, Mr. Nemesio.
- Thanks, boy.

210
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:46,396
- Does it have to be full to leave?
- Well, I have to make a profit.

211
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,670
We’re all in a hurry.

212
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,438
- Fine, Congressman.
- Good bye.

213
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,233
- How much?
- Four tickets and we’ll leave.

214
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,588
Give me the change.

215
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,551
- Fine, Mr. Eladio.
- Come on, Congressman.

216
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,796
You first. Go ahead.

217
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,549
That’s okay.

218
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,672
- Hurrah for Mr. Eladio.
- Hurrah, hurrah.

219
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,598
- Your change, Congressman.
- Thanks, Silvestre.

220
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,718
- Ready?
- Let’s go.

221
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,190
- Step on it, man.
- Step on it.

222
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:30,229
Well, I’ll be darned.
We have a flat.

223
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,795
You said it loud enough.
We’re not deaf.

224
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,956
- Where’s the spare?
- On top.

225
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,752
Things can’t go on like this forever, and
when my situation changes...

226
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,549
-...if there’s anything I can do for you.
- I heard you’ll be appointed judge.

227
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,829
In a matter of days.

228
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,828
Despite my forlorn appearance
the governor is a friend of mine...

229
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,669
and the president studied
with a friend’s friend.

230
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,028
Oh, that’s good.

231
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,310
Here, let me light it for you.

232
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,952
- Why let a cigarette go out?
- To get some courtesy back, doll.

233
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,952
Do you want to put it out?

234
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,878
Patience, you’ll be back in time.

235
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,719
- Perhaps, but it’s so slow.
- A slow stride is better than a tiring one.

236
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,957
- If I were the driver...
- You’d crash the bus.

237
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,476
Look at those curves, you
always lose control there.

238
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,149
Since when?
I’m not a handle.

239
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,311
It’s all I can hold on to.

240
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,479
- You’re used to being supported.
- Slopes frighten me, you see.

241
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,996
Back off, back off.
Buy yourself a scapular.

242
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,995
The fog looks like cotton.
Look.

243
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,476
The Congressman feels
safer beside Silvestre.

244
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,076
- You don’t feel well, do you?
- I’m already sick.

245
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,477
Look out for that pothole.

246
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,591
You think I’m not looking.

247
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,794
That rock!

248
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,118
- I told you, you fool.
- Don’t distract me.

249
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,870
Too many people in the kitchen
spoil the pan of chicken.

250
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,798
If it weren’t for this wooden leg
I would be walking by now.

251
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,999
And the little angels are so quiet.
Such innocence.

252
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,837
- Move your arm, I can’t drive.
- Careful, please be careful.

253
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,956
You’d better stop until the fog clears up.

254
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,069
We’d lose more time.

255
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,431
Others are in a hurry, too.

256
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,398
He keeps bothering me!
We all need to get there fast.

257
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,670
- It hurts a lot, doesn’t it?
- I feel terrible.

258
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,190
You should have come sooner.

259
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,237
I think it’s close.

260
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,158
Calm down, calm down.

261
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,912
Now we’re in for it,
here comes another car.

262
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,118
Almonds, sugar coated peanuts,
candy and chewing gum.

263
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,071
- Like this, mother?
- Be quiet.

264
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,760
- Watch out.
- I couldn’t be more careful.

265
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,475
- Please, back up. We’re in a hurry.
- Hey buddy, back up.

266
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,478
- Let’s go.
- I’d like to sir, but I can’t.

267
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,272
- My reverse doesn’t work.
- What?

268
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,870
- Back up or I’ll make you.
- This junk couldn’t even be towed.

269
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,195
Let’s see.

270
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,839
All right, let’s go.

271
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,475
Pull.

272
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,152
Harder on reverse.
Harder, man.

273
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,389
We need a pulley.

274
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:44,433
Congressman, I’m familiar with this.
Back up, and it’ll be solved. Look, Mr. Eladio.

275
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:53,189
- Fidencio, wait. Let’s get off.
- No, I don’t want to. Stop it.

276
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,959
You pig. You’re always sniffling
but never blow your nose. Creep.

277
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,959
<i>Gross,</i> snot.

278
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:04,435
- Oh, my, what happened?
- Silvestre, get off and take the kids.

279
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:08,155
Call some women to help with Feliza.
Go on, hurry.

280
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,396
Turn around, don’t look.

281
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,156
Women! I need two.
Hurry, quickly.

282
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,431
- They’re coming.
- Hurry.

283
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,955
Come on, I’ll take you.

284
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,995
- What do you need?
- Get in, no questions.

285
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,069
Come on.

286
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,353
This happened to me years ago
on a boat, and I’m fine.

287
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,792
Hurry. Don’t just stand there.
And don’t let any men in here.

288
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,953
- Move, I’m going in.
- You can’t.

289
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:55,232
It’s the honey, I need to wash it down.
I need my bottle.

290
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,435
No, you son of a...

291
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,518
- Oh, Oliverio, Oliverio.
- What?

292
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,789
Look...

293
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,949
- Really?
- Yes.

294
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,078
I’m sorry. I’ll see what I can do.

295
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:13,068
- Do you know what’s going on?
- We don’t have a place for the show.

296
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,795
Too bad, find a way.
We made the trip, it’s too late.

297
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,831
Ma’am, everything is fine.

298
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,632
- Do you want to come?
- Heavens.

299
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,116
- Mother, let me see it.
- Stay right here, girl.

300
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,832
- Stay here.
- Oh, child.

301
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,390
What are you up to, pretty little bud?

302
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:32,633
- I’m taking this to Feliza.
- Don’t let her mistreat you. Don’t get burnt.

303
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,798
- What if I do?
- You’ll burn me, too.

304
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,470
- You’ve got experience, child.
- Experience?

305
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,399
You bet. Do you want to try?

306
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,477
I’m burning for you, and you’re so evasive.
Put some time aside for me.

307
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:51,599
Those squeaking doors.
Get someone to oil them.

308
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,751
- I think it was a boy.
- A boy?

309
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,431
It’s a boy, it’s a boy.

310
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,716
It’s about time, so many girls.

311
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,554
I’m going to cry my eyes out.

312
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:06,593
Hospitals with all their staff
can’t pick flowers like this.

313
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,599
- How’s the mother?
- Just fine. She wants to go home.

314
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,190
Tell the men to climb on board
to help her get off.

315
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,118
- He sure is cute, look at that...
- He’s so cute.

316
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,993
He’s cute, isn’t he?

317
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,351
Silvestre, I’m helping too.

318
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,311
- She’s heavy.
- Come on, come on.

319
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,034
- Help me, Silvestre.
- Yes, Oliverio, let’s see.

320
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,231
Be careful. Get a good grip.

321
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,391
- Slowly.
- I’ll hold her legs.

322
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,028
- Come on.
- Careful.

323
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,354
We’ll take her.

324
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,914
We’ll try to make her
as comfortable as possible.

325
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,918
Marta, Marta, get out
so the lady is comfortable.

326
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:45,196
The baby’s father will be thrilled
when he gets back from the mine.

327
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:48,551
Imagine when Albina
surprises you like this?

328
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,079
Bring me my son.

329
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,713
Mrs. Linda, bring me the boy.

330
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,432
Cover him up, he’ll get sick.

331
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,110
Give him to his mother.

332
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,233
Congratulations.

333
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,158
Give me those boxes, girl.
Where’s the blanket?

334
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,271
Let’s see that smile.

335
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,075
Congratulations.
I’d love to be his godfather.

336
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,715
I have lots of godchildren.
But he will be my favourite.

337
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,310
- I want to see the cutie.
- Move. Don’t pester the lady.

338
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,511
- He has hair, look.
- Thanks.

339
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:21,514
- Isn’t he just like his father?
- Tough luck. You’re as ugly as him.

340
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,836
Let’s go, it’s getting late.

341
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,632
Take care of him, he’s lovely.

342
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,318
- Shut the door.
- I’ll cover him.

343
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,432
Get in, it’s getting late.

344
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,080
What did I say?
See how fluid it is now?.

345
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,515
Yes, but you can’t deny
there was an accident.

346
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,518
Sure, but in exchange
of a new life.

347
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,389
Huh, boy.

348
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,636
Cheer up, everything will be fine.

349
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,309
The rain didn’t fill the river.

350
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,111
We’ll never get ahead like this.

351
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,197
Animals and people together.

352
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,397
- How nice.
- This is a drag.

353
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,431
Civilization. I don’t understand.

354
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,433
We have a right to use
public services no matter what.

355
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,829
It’s mine.

356
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,468
- Hit him, get him.
- It’s mine.

357
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,238
Enough, stop fighting.

358
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,476
- Get out of here.
- Damn it.

359
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,554
Stay still, you’re acting
like chilli peppers.

360
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:53,117
- Now you’re really going to get it.
- What if you had broken my leg?

361
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,229
So what?

362
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,036
You could buy another one.

363
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,196
Settle down, settle down.

364
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,638
Let’s see what your
godfather brought you.

365
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,113
Godfather.

366
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:49,397
Again, <i>compadre.</i>
That’s what we’re here for.

367
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,039
What happened?

368
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:57,757
It’s like with the slippers.
They get their feet wet before the dance.

369
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:02,476
- Why won’t it start?
- I’ll take a look, must be the rocks.

370
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,512
Come on, Mr. Pedro.

371
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,119
Help that man who fell.

372
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,392
You’re filthy, you need a bath.
Let’s take a dip in that pond.

373
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,879
You go ahead.

374
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,790
Don’t worry. We’ll get the bus out
thanks to my <i>compadre.</i>

375
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:46,353
This darn bus is like a pig.
It loves mud.

376
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,632
Don’t get mad.
Let’s take a dip, you’ll relax.

377
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:53,272
I understand that you’re sad.
Poor thing.

378
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,272
Married and single.

379
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,628
I don’t need your pity.

380
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:00,196
Sure. Albina is very pretty,
but she isn’t with you.

381
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,436
That’s why I want to go back.

382
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:05,120
Come on, don’t play hard to get.

383
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,234
Animal traction is obsolete.

384
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,715
We’re an industrialized country.
Look over there.

385
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,837
My train of oxen can pull it out, Mr. Eladio.
Why go so far?

386
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,554
You’re enemies of progress.

387
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,990
- Yes, Mr. Eladio. The oxen are too slow.
- Yeah, but they’re sure.

388
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,633
I’ll get the tractor.

389
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,074
- Tell me, do you dislike me?
- No, why?

390
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,874
Because you act
like you don’t know me.

391
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:26,716
- I’m treating you as always.
- Yeah, but now we’re not as always.

392
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,512
Oh, you’re so faithful.

393
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:33,595
Poor Albina, she has no idea who she
married and it seems you don’t either.

394
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:37,919
- What’s wrong with her?
- It’s not about her. It’s about you.

395
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,109
<i>Pull that.</i>

396
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,758
- Come on, bum, push. Stop lazing about.
- You do it, if you’re so savvy.

397
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:17,076
I’ll be dog-gone.
Now Mr. Eladio’s really done it.

398
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,589
Second gear, to your left.

399
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,557
I know what I’m doing.

400
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,239
Not by the edge.

401
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,831
Not by the edge, you dunce.

402
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,279
I told you to move
to the left, stupid.

403
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,755
All right, to the left it is.

404
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:41,949
- This politician is a show-off.
- Always fussing about.

405
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,318
Back up.

406
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,914
I’ll be damned, man.

407
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,998
If those are his speeches,
he’s sure to win.

408
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,078
Thought it was easy to
do two things at a time.

409
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,713
We’re stuck.

410
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,428
Look at the bus.

411
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:15,633
She manipulates others besides her father.
Give me those cheeks.

412
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,591
That’s why I’m your godfather.

413
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,352
Narrow-minded nitwits.

414
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,029
The animal traction
got tired and left.

415
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,913
Let’s go, Silvestre.
Please, it’s late.

416
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,914
Let’s all go.

417
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,191
Don’t forget about me.

418
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,032
It had to be you.

419
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,355
Did you want to leave me here?

420
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,233
Oh, you’re such a nuisance,
what a pest.

421
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,395
Not a pest.

422
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:47,712
- More like a plant.
- No wonder you want to grow roots.

423
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,631
Were you thinking of me?

424
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,432
Pay up, Rosalio.

425
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,314
I may have <i>dough,</i>
but I’m not your relative.

426
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:09,359
What? I’ll ask you when I hang my hat
on them.

427
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:12,472
You think everyone’s like you.

428
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,709
The guy at the wheel.
To the crossroads.

429
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,838
- Are you selling chickens?
- Not ordinary livestock.

430
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,714
I only deal Legore, Rhode Island
and others from my catalogue.

431
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,236
Tell me when you have
feathers for my mattress.

432
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,312
- Silvestre, it’s late, let’s go.
- Come on, let’s.

433
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,749
Let’s all climb on the bus.

434
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,271
Mommy, give me some bread.

435
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,233
- I knew you had some.
- Stop pestering.

436
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,869
- Do you want a bite?
- No, thanks.

437
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,989
Well.

438
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,353
- You sound like a...
- Spaniard, from Madrid. Mr...

439
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,392
Nemesio Alvarez y Villalbazo,
at your service.

440
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,511
- Miguel Suarez, at your service.
- Pleasure.

441
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,671
- What do you do?
- I sell hens.

442
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,279
- Where are they?
- Here.

443
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,149
- Right here?
- It’s cheaper than cages.

444
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:14,198
Those are some nice looking hens.
Are they expensive?

445
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:18,831
Well, they yield a lot. There’s no better
business than a hen farm.

446
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,713
If you’re interested.

447
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:26,039
As long as I’m not done justice and
recover my land, I can’t think of it.

448
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,673
Oh, man.

449
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,951
They may think I’m lazy.

450
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:11,158
If I don’t get some sleep,
we’ll be dead.

451
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,710
- Don’t worry, I’ll sleep on the luggage.
- Stop loafing around.

452
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,478
I have to be in Petatlan early.

453
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:20,275
You said we’d make it on time
to catch the bus to Chilpancingo.

454
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,234
- I can’t stand it anymore.
- Let me drive, I’m not sleepy.

455
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:27,318
Whatever. I’m going to sleep.

456
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:37,433
Everybody doing their own will. If it weren’t
for you, what a country this would be?

457
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,352
No wonder we don’t get ahead.

458
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,794
I’m going to file a complaint.

459
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,912
This man here is the
complaining kind.

460
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,548
And he hasn’t confronted
real problems yet.

461
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,672
Always among hens, all he
does is cluck and complain.

462
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,598
Yes, but like a rooster.
People like you are our doom.

463
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,199
Mom, look at him snore.

464
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,471
- He even whistles.
- Like a train, huh?

465
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,756
Yes, son. Come here.

466
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,029
Good morning.

467
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,430
Look at her twisting
like a caterpillar.

468
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,835
Move. Give me that.

469
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:52,875
If you broke my mirror with all that bouncing
around, you won’t live to tell about it.

470
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,556
What a life, brother.
They pay you for sleeping.

471
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,389
Would you like your chocolate, sir?

472
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,717
- I can see Petatlan.
- Who said we’re going there?

473
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,793
- Aren’t we going to Petatlan?
- Yes, we are.

474
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:11,830
But first, we’ll drop by my mother’s ranch
to serenade her. Today’s her birthday.

475
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,439
Everyone’s invited.

476
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,591
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

477
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:20,479
<i>Happy birthday to you...</i>

478
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:24,434
<i>...happy birthday to you...</i>

479
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:28,799
<i>...we’ve come to sing...</i>

480
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:32,799
<i>...to beautiful girls like you.</i>

481
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:37,074
<i>Wake up, dear, wake up</i>

482
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,708
- <i>The sun has risen.</i>
- Sorry, man.

483
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:43,595
But what would you do if
it were your mother’s birthday?

484
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,995
I don’t know, my mother is dying.

485
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,678
Don’t get depressed.

486
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:51,998
Even if you arrive early,
you can’t return to San Jeronimito today.

487
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,510
Besides, the lawyer
won’t even be up yet.

488
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,154
There’s a motorcycle waiting for me.

489
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:03,077
Just a few yards from my mother’s house.
I hope nobody leaves without toasting for her.

490
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,553
We’ll be delighted.

491
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,635
- What’s your mother like?
- She’s a true beauty.

492
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:24,753
- You know I wish for you the best, mother.
- Thank you, dear.

493
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:28,835
Did you hear, mother?
Get up, today’s a great day.

494
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,952
The only day I can’t get up early.

495
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,073
There’s Silvestre.

496
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,671
I have to pretend I’m asleep.

497
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,873
<i>...the birds are chirping...</i>

498
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,869
<i>...and the moon has risen.</i>

499
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,874
<i>What a beautiful morning...</i>

500
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:52,032
Open up, here is my
loving mother’s son...

501
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,948
- Come on.
- Oh, Silvestre, my son. Heavens. Oh.

502
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,640
You’re tearing me apart, boy.

503
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,676
I’m starving.

504
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:05,229
As idle and glutton as always.

505
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:10,195
Mother. My passengers are going to
accompany us. Come here. Come in.

506
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,912
Ma’am, accept my most
sincere congratulations.

507
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:18,396
Pleased to meet you and honoured
by the invitation.

508
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:21,996
Mother, Mr. Eladio is our candidate
for Congress.

509
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,720
Thank you so much.
The table is served. Come in.

510
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:27,798
- Sit down, please.
- Thank you, ma’am.

511
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,638
You better behave.

512
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:35,469
- Grandfather.
- My darling.

513
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:40,355
You must be dying to be together
after so many days apart.

514
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:43,319
- How have you been, Mr. Nemesio?
- Fine, Mrs. Tita.

515
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:46,916
Many happy returns.
With our best wishes.

516
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,951
- Thank you.
- Chocolate, Mr. Nemesio.

517
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:53,073
- Don’t trouble yourselves, Justina.
- Don’t be shy, don’t be shy.

518
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,556
- Tend to them, Justina.
- A table for you and your girl.

519
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,551
Come, this way.

520
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:06,198
- Have a nice day, Mrs. Sixta.
- Thank you, sonny.

521
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,436
- How’s your mother?
- Very ill when I left.

522
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:13,674
- I may not see her alive again.
- God willing, you will and she’ll soon get well.

523
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,313
The chocolate is getting cold.

524
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,876
- Please sit down.
- Yes, please sit.

525
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,153
Move that hat.

526
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:34,793
Thank you, but this chair is too low for me.
I’d rather sit between two thorns.

527
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,319
Don’t compare me.

528
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,835
I’m thorn enough to poke
whoever bothers you, love.

529
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:41,998
- You took the biggest one.
- It’s mine.

530
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:45,192
- Did I teach you those manners?
- Calm down, there’s more.

531
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,309
I’ll be.

532
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:52,031
Carmelita, I asked you to behave.
Don’t dip it.

533
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,475
We’re among family, granddaddy.

534
00:44:54,600 --> 00:45:01,756
That’s why. Out of respect to this house
and their kindness, you should behave.

535
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:08,229
Where are you?

536
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:11,558
Quiet. We want to hear
the congressman speak.

537
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,477
- Speak.
- Yes, speak.

538
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:19,955
In the history of all peoples, mothers have
always occupied the first place.

539
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:23,955
Nobody knows who came first.
The chicken or the egg.

540
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,638
The agent can tell us that.

541
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:30,914
Young man, just because I sell them
doesn’t mean I’m a chicken.

542
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:33,913
I’m serious.
Excuse the interruption.

543
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,195
I’ll continue, madam.

544
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:40,434
It’s moving to see this example which should
be the reflection of every good child.

545
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,393
So, in memory of my beloved mother...

546
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:47,519
and of yours, if you’ll allow me, in honour also
of the birthday girl...

547
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:52,356
I’d like to pick the petals of the anthology
threaded...

548
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,790
by the lucid and distinguished conception
of this great bard, Pepe Radilla...

549
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:01,154
tireless glory of contemporary literature
and radiant sun of our state.

550
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,038
This is getting sour.

551
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:09,116
If I had no respect for where I am, and the
date we’re celebrating, my dear cripple...

552
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:12,437
I’d be stirring your curdled milk by now.

553
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:52,598
<i>San Marcos is famous</i>
<i>for its beautiful women</i>

554
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:58,478
<i>San Marcos is famous</i>

555
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:03,590
<i>Acapulco also has its share</i>
<i>of different little faces</i>

<i>Beloved woman of San Marcos</i>

557
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:44,033
Won’t you speak to us in Spanish?

558
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,112
Look, gentlemen.
There you can see...

559
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:53,279
a typical little Mexican ranch.

560
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:56,677
Poor, but clean.
And very joyful.

561
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:57,989
We got here just in time.

562
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:03,952
You can use your half-hour rest
to witness a typical <i>fiesta.</i>

563
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:07,790
- A typical <i>fiesta.</i>
- Magnificent, magnificent.

564
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:11,593
Don’t get into trouble,
no English spoken.

565
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:23,670
<i>Beloved woman of San Marcos,</i>
<i>lovely woman of San Marcos</i>

566
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:27,556
What’s up, Raquel?
Aren’t you happy with Jeronimito?

567
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:30,911
I’ll bet my name on it.
All right, people.

568
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,358
- Make yourselves at home.
- Thank you. Excuse me.

569
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:43,471
Make yourselves at home.

570
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:07,153
<i>I’m not from San Marcos</i>
<i>I’m from San Jeronimito</i>

<i>Beloved woman of San Marcos,</i>
<i>lovely woman of San Marcos</i>

574
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:44,639
Mr. Eladio, keep an eye on your little chick.
Somebody may steal her away.

575
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:48,355
They would if they could.
Now I’ll be chirping.

576
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:57,878
<i>Not only the women of San Marcos</i>
<i>are pretty and lovely</i>

577
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:03,319
<i>Not only the women of San Marcos</i>
<i>are pretty and lovely</i>

578
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:06,478
Carmelita, take your elbows off the table.

579
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:10,155
Eat slowly.
Don’t bolt your food, it’s bad manners.

580
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:13,875
- Were you well tended, Mr. Nemesio?
- Service was great, Mrs. Sixta.

581
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,994
Just like every time I come.
Do you know when Silvestre is returning?

582
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:22,590
- Tomorrow, I suppose. Today...
- That’s too bad.

583
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,996
Today is the last day
of Carmelita’s vacation.

584
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:29,512
Look, <i>amigo.</i>

585
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:34,117
- Would you like to sell my hat?
- How could I? Sell it yourself.

586
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:39,473
You don’t have a nice hat.
Here, buy mine. Ten <i>pesos.</i>

587
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:42,480
I don’t want your hat.
I want this.

588
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:46,630
- You wear a bonnet, I wear a hat.
- Don’t pester me, mister.

589
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:47,749
Excuse me?

590
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:53,552
I don’t deserve to have
the mother I do, Mrs. Linda.

591
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:57,795
She suffered so much
since she became a widow.

592
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:02,238
- To handle a lost soul like me.
- Come, come now.

593
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:05,909
- Who is your mother’s pride?
- No, no, no.

594
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:09,152
She would say that out of kindness.

595
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:15,595
She will go straight to Heaven
fully dressed to her shoes.

596
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:32,076
- Where are you going in that state?
- I’m a man, mom.

597
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:34,670
To keep my promise.

598
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:38,117
- I have a debt.
- A debt? Who do you owe?

599
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:41,029
My friend.

600
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:44,952
- I have to take him to Petatlan.
- You will stay right here.

601
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:46,069
Look, Silvestre.

602
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:49,000
You know my hurry.
Lend me your truck.

603
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:53,273
If you ask for my life...
my life I would give to you.

604
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:54,589
Take it.

605
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,191
It’s all yours.

606
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:59,152
Will you look at that.

607
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:08,955
Candidate. It’s ten o’clock.

608
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:12,798
Damn, the motorcycle isn’t here yet.

609
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:17,113
Who told me to act like a priest
snooping in none of my business?

610
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:22,355
- I thought this would happen, Congressman.
- That’s what you think. I’ve got the victory.

611
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:25,916
Except the rally won’t
be the same without me.

612
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,476
Raquel, where are you going?

613
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:45,355
I’m spending the night
in Petatlan, bye.

614
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:54,276
You’ve been warned.
They stole her from you, Congressman.

615
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:18,717
ASCENT TO HEAVEN PASS

616
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:34,794
- Leave me alone.
- Come on.

617
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:44,556
I’ve always liked you, Oliverio.
But now you’re electrifying me.

618
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:45,669
Simmer down.

619
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:47,792
I like them better gruff.

620
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:50,115
Stop horsing around,
we’re going to lose control.

621
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,631
- I want to lose control.
- I’m in no mood for jokes.

622
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:55,717
Hey, don’t get so jumpy.

623
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,117
Can’t you see you’re not alone?
You’re reckless.

624
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:08,472
Sure, I’m worth nothing to you,
you don’t care if you kill me.

625
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:13,077
After humiliating me for so long.
What woman would risk so much?

626
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,953
- Say something, you sissy.
- All because of this rain.

627
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:19,158
Yeah, blame the rain.
Stop playing the fool.

628
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:42,231
- Let go.
- You brute.

629
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,073
- It’s all your fault, you tramp.
- If the baker is no good, he blames the flour.

630
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:58,193
- Don’t give me that nonsense.
- You’re right to be mad, darling.

631
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:02,279
- Do with me whatever you want.
- When we get to the top I’ll teach you...

632
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:05,279
If you were a man
you’d have done that already.

633
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,391
You’ll see soon enough.

634
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,550
We’re at the top. Now what?

635
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:30,951
Weren’t you going to teach me,
little jasmine flower?

636
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:35,278
I’m going to teach you to respect me.
Shameless tramp.

637
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:37,356
Come on. It was fate.

638
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:40,148
I was so wrong in throwing myself at you.

639
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:41,315
Hit me.

640
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,636
Is Mr. Eladio Gonzalez here?

641
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:21,876
- Who? The candidate?
- Yes.

642
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:24,634
- I need to see him.
- You’ll find him at that house.

643
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,034
Thank you very much.

644
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:31,874
- Your junk won’t make it back.
- Oliverio is one of the best drivers around.

645
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,879
But with all the thunder and dynamite
he’s carrying...

646
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,912
you’ll have to collect
his body with a shovel.

647
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:42,430
- Don’t be so gloomy, Mr. Gonzalez.
- Why, Mr. Nemesio?

648
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:48,317
Silvestre, is it allowed to take dynamite on
buses? We travel with children, and...

649
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:52,551
It’s a manner of speech.

650
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:55,549
I see.

651
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:03,474
Hi, Pedro.

652
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:05,798
Just a minute, please.

653
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:15,153
Who would know that Eladio,
the son of a simple water carrier...

654
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:17,874
would consider being
Father of the Homeland?

655
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:21,550
Buckets are like...
...like...

656
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:25,679
Life is like the buckets of a water-wheel,
my dear Mr. Nemesio.

657
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:30,192
My committee wants me to go to
Petatlan instead of Chilpancingo.

658
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,357
I’m a fortunate man, aren’t I?

659
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:35,631
Say good-bye to the family for me.
Good-bye, doll.

660
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,438
- Raquel.
- Yes?

661
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:08,911
- Where are you going?
- Wherever you’re staying.

662
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:11,072
I can take you anywhere.

663
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:15,716
In that case, take me to the
Golden Palm, it’s five blocks away.

664
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:19,116
A. Figueroa y Lezama
Lawyer

665
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:27,158
No, son, no.

666
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:32,036
At my age, I wouldn’t go to San Jeronimito
for all the gold in the world.

667
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:36,438
Risk crossing that <i>Ascent to Heaven?</i>
Don’t even think of it.

668
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:40,988
- But, Mr. Counsellor...
- Don’t worry, man, don’t fret.

669
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:45,358
I know how to fix this
without risking my life.

670
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:47,232
Just leave it to me.

671
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:51,638
- Mother must dictate her will.
- Forget the will.

672
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:56,834
Listen, do you know somebody trustworthy
enough to say that...

673
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:00,077
your mother owes that person money?

674
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:03,038
Well, my father-in-law, Mr. Lucilo Pena.

675
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:04,229
Excellent.

676
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,554
I have a means to solve all this.

677
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:11,036
See?
I’m going to fill in these papers.

678
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:16,194
Then, your mother needs to put her finger
print on them. Here.

679
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:17,509
Under each bill of debt.

680
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:21,511
I’ll write them in
your father-in-law’s name.

681
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:28,149
Mr. Lucilo must impound the Portales house
and write it off in your nephew’s name.

682
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:33,035
These documents are legally valid.
Your siblings can’t dispute them.

683
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:36,192
I hope not.
You don’t know how greedy they are.

684
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:39,198
Who knows what they’re scheming now.

685
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:44,839
In complete use of her
mental faculties...

686
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:45,989
...declares...

687
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:49,999
to be the owner of a property
called The Large Coconut Grove.

688
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:53,152
- The boats and the fishing gear.
- Those are for Oliverio.

689
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:56,158
It shall be clearly stated.
So...

690
00:59:57,240 --> 01:00:00,152
In the presence of Mr. Juan
and Mr. Felipe Grajales...

691
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:02,840
- The house in Portales.
- We said it was mine.

692
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,594
Put it in writing.
Words are like feathers in the wind.

693
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:08,439
That’s why we’re making this document.
You have to decide.

694
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:09,549
Let’s do it.

695
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:15,397
- By right, the house is mine.
- It’s rightfully mine, I’m the eldest.

696
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:17,318
Are you giving in?

697
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:20,353
- Me, give in? Never.
- Then, you have to play.

698
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:22,511
- One match.
- Let’s play.

699
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:29,794
You first.
See? I’m even giving you a head start.

700
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:32,555
Anyway, the house in Portales is for me.

701
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:34,557
Luck will settle it.

702
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:39,992
Two fives.
Black is your fate.

703
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:45,594
Two sixes.

704
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:49,469
See? It’s God’s will.
What did I tell you?

705
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:54,990
The house in Portales will be inherited by
the individual Juan Grajales.

706
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:01,352
Quiet, your grandmother’s asleep.

707
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:18,830
- Mother.
- How are you, mother?

708
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,399
Slightly better.

709
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:23,478
We made out your will with
the Municipal authority.

710
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:26,239
Yes, mother.
To spare you the trouble.

711
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:28,312
Why don’t you let her rest?

712
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:31,068
- Come later.
- Be quiet, you dummy.

713
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:33,595
- You have no say in this.
- Why not?

714
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:36,473
- She’s my daughter-in-law.
- Felipe.

715
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:38,033
I think she’s right.

716
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:42,631
If you don’t mind, Albina.
Will you bring the pen so mother can sign?

717
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,036
You know I can’t write.

718
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:48,317
You don’t have to write, mother.
Look, here.

719
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:51,910
You just need to make an "x"
under the written part.

720
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:55,271
I can’t move this hand.
It’s heavy.

721
01:01:55,400 --> 01:02:00,190
That doesn’t matter. Let’s try with your left.
I’ll guide your hand.

722
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:05,917
Why with the left if she just said she’s better?
Give me that.

723
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:08,315
You won’t refuse, will you?

724
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:09,669
Make an "x".

725
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:13,237
I won’t do anything until Oliverio returns.

726
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:17,196
- Where is he?
- Yeah, where is he?

727
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:31,157
Good-bye, Raquel.

728
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:34,194
- Are you going back?
- Yes, do you need anything?

729
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:37,158
- Not me.
- In case you wanted something.

730
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:39,471
I got what I wanted.

731
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:42,151
Well then, good-bye.

732
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:44,828
Good-bye, and good luck, baby.

733
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:58,032
Here so soon, Congressman?
What a surprise.

734
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:01,397
Keep your distance, girl.
Try your tricks on someone else.

735
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:06,992
Heavens, you can’t take a joke.
I was right in my taste for young boys.

736
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:10,715
I said, behave yourself.
Stay around, we’ll talk later.

737
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:15,356
Don’t try so hard to be a man.
So handsome and such a good catch.

738
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:23,388
Here come my people.
Go away, this is a serious matter.

739
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:26,952
They’ve come for the shepherd
who will keep them united.

740
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:34,519
Quiet.

741
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:38,638
Friends.
Here is the cowardly Eladio.

742
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:43,469
- Hurrah for the people’s candidate!
- Hurrah!

743
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:51,637
Death to him.

744
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:53,711
- Death.
- Death.

745
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:57,631
Death to him.

746
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:00,075
- Death.
- Death.

747
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:03,836
Calm down.
This nation is free and democratic.

748
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:06,714
We fight for principles
not for men.

749
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:10,555
Every Mexican has a right
to vote and be voted.

750
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,671
Suffrage is free.

751
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:18,951
Mr. Eladio Gonzalez, a political adversary
is not a personal enemy.

752
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:22,152
- Let me shake that hand.
- With pleasure.

753
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:27,639
I am deeply pleased to be your opponent.
There are still some moral men left.

754
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:30,559
That’s what I say.
Your words honour me.

755
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:34,190
Ballot boxes, not insults,
will give us the victory.

756
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:38,313
- That’s what I expect, my friend.
- Good-bye, my friend.

757
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:41,269
Let the march continue.

758
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:44,949
Actions, Not Words
Sanchez Coello

759
01:04:56,920 --> 01:05:00,037
Hurrah for the People’s Candidate

760
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:08,959
My poor Congressman. Look what they did.
Come, I’ll wash you.

761
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:12,277
Go back to your chores.
This is not a matter for women.

762
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:13,919
Please go away.

763
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:17,477
Forget the past.
Come so I can wash you.

764
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:20,155
Leave me alone, madam.

765
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:04,319
- <i>Compadre</i> Chema, what’s the matter?
- Just life, <i>compadre.</i>

766
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:08,228
Eusebita, your goddaughter.
She’s left us.

767
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:12,353
No, what do you mean?
We just saw her yesterday.

768
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:17,589
It was very quick, <i>compadre.</i>
A snake bit her, and... You know.

769
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:18,749
Mr. Chema.

770
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:21,110
- I share your pain.
- Thank you.

771
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:24,118
Chema...
I can’t find the words, you know...

772
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:25,754
My goddaughter.

773
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:28,832
Be strong, <i>compadre.</i>

774
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:32,034
- I share your pain.
- Thank you.

775
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:34,671
Let’s go.

776
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:46,591
- I feel your loss.
- Thank you, Mr. Nemesio.

777
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:37,635
Who would have known?
Some go and others arrive.

778
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:42,516
Two days ago a little angel was born,
today another one took flight.

779
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:43,629
Poor thing.

780
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:48,311
Poor us, who have to endure such
disorderly times.

781
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:53,395
- May I see her face, Mr. Chema?
- Yes, dear.

782
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:54,589
Look at her.

783
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:58,878
- Wasn’t my little girl pretty?
- Yes, Mr. Chema.

784
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:04,677
She looks like she’s asleep.
Too bad the earth has to eat her.

785
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:40,078
Silvestre, I feel so bad for Mr. Chema.
But you know I have to go.

786
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:44,199
- Since you have to be with him, I’ll walk.
- Man, there’s always a solution.

787
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:49,036
I’ll stay for the burial.
You take the car. That easy.

788
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:50,997
Thank you, Silvestre.

789
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:28,470
Look after your luggage.
I’ll be right back.

790
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:32,434
I can’t believe this guy.
He runs and leaves us here.

791
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:35,114
Who will be responsible
if something is missing?

792
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:37,311
I’ll unload the top.

793
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:50,749
Albina.

794
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:55,712
- Your mother.
- No.

795
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:58,236
You barely missed her.

796
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:41,911
<i>I got what I wanted.</i>

797
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:57,030
- Where are my brothers?
- They left this morning.

798
01:10:57,240 --> 01:11:00,232
- Where is Chucho?
- I left him asleep at the patch.

799
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:03,432
Go to the door and tell me if anyone comes.

800
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:42,510
Here come your brothers.

801
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:28,594
Come with me.
This is the moment.

802
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:44,552
We couldn’t tell you before, but mother
dictated her final will which is on this paper.

803
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:48,230
Yes, Oliverio.
It’s all there, poor mother.

804
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:51,557
Her final moments were harder
because you weren’t here.

805
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:54,359
- This isn’t valid. It isn’t signed.
- What proof do you want?

806
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:56,152
Isn’t our word enough?

807
01:12:56,360 --> 01:13:00,592
We’ll talk some other day.
When we’re calmer. This isn’t the right time.

808
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:03,553
Oliverio is right. Let’s not rush.

809
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:07,469
Besides, we have to respect
the loss we are grieving.

810
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:10,030
Albina... come.

811
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:25,711
Did you hear?
You won’t get your way.

812
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:29,157
Bottomless ditch,
scoundrels.

813
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:33,311
Save the bills of credit.

814
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:38,479
My mother’s will shall prevail.
The house in Portales will be Chucho’s.

815
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:42,355
He’ll go to school and have everything
he needs.

816
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:14,558
THE END
