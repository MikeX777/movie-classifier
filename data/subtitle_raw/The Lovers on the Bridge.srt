00:01:23,062 --> 00:01:27,420
LOVERS ON THE PONT-NEUF

2
00:04:46,514 --> 00:04:48,232
It's Alex again!

3
00:04:49,035 --> 00:04:51,026
Come on back, Alex! Come on!

4
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:19,672
Don't you talk to me like that!

5
00:05:21,883 --> 00:05:23,441
Don't fuck with me!

6
00:05:23,644 --> 00:05:25,282
Name's not Marie Asshole!

7
00:05:26,005 --> 00:05:28,041
It's Madame JEAN.

8
00:05:36,087 --> 00:05:42,084
Hey, Peanut! Wha' do I do?
How? Don't know.

9
00:06:35,182 --> 00:06:36,410
Please come here, Lieutenant.

10
00:06:36,783 --> 00:06:39,343
How about picking up the
empties...

11
00:06:40,424 --> 00:06:42,892
bottles and bodies!

12
00:06:57,508 --> 00:07:01,057
Yeah... All bashed up...
Come on, smartass...

13
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,667
Make an effort.

14
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:09,101
Shit!... Fed up doin' for you...

15
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:25,079
Third time you hit me!

16
00:08:25,331 --> 00:08:27,891
Good Lord's gonna kill you.

17
00:08:33,893 --> 00:08:35,963
That does it. Let's go.

18
00:09:41,431 --> 00:09:44,946
See, Alex, do you good
to talk to me.

19
00:09:48,673 --> 00:09:50,425
Gotta try to talk.

20
00:09:54,434 --> 00:09:58,029
You don't want to?...
You got to!...

21
00:09:58,395 --> 00:10:01,785
Gonna take you down south.

22
00:10:01,996 --> 00:10:04,351
There's mywife, my kids...

23
00:10:06,997 --> 00:10:08,828
We'll better be off there.

24
00:10:09,038 --> 00:10:11,188
Just look at Paris...

25
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:15,709
Gotta go back to the bridge.

26
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,516
Look, you're like me.

27
00:10:20,361 --> 00:10:22,317
Only live once.

28
00:10:26,282 --> 00:10:27,556
Right?

29
00:10:28,483 --> 00:10:31,600
Got one life and wanna live it.

30
00:10:34,605 --> 00:10:37,073
You gotta choose, see?

31
00:10:40,886 --> 00:10:42,205
Goin' back to the bridge.

32
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,086
Look, Alex...

33
00:10:48,368 --> 00:10:49,801
think it over...

34
00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:54,838
Take a minute to think it over.

35
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:57,166
A minute...

36
00:10:59,011 --> 00:11:01,047
Cause it's too late.

37
00:11:46,383 --> 00:11:49,341
CITY OF PARIS -
RESTORATION OF THE PONT-NEUF

38
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:53,942
PARIS' OLDEST BRIDGE,
IN HAZARDOUS CONDITION,

39
00:11:54,185 --> 00:11:58,179
WILL BE CLOSED
TO VEHICLES AND PEDESTRIANS

40
00:11:58,386 --> 00:12:00,581
REOPENING : SUMMER 1991

41
00:12:24,193 --> 00:12:25,467
Hans,

42
00:12:29,034 --> 00:12:30,353
it's me.

43
00:12:41,718 --> 00:12:42,912
It's me.

44
00:12:44,918 --> 00:12:46,715
I told you...

45
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:49,271
when you go nuts

46
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,795
you come to me... not the bottle!

47
00:12:59,722 --> 00:13:00,837
What's that?

48
00:13:02,123 --> 00:13:03,875
Bone's broke... It's gonna knit.

49
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,436
And that?

50
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:07,003
Fell.

51
00:13:09,325 --> 00:13:11,441
Pass me my downer.

52
00:13:20,248 --> 00:13:22,125
Cops pick you up?

53
00:13:22,328 --> 00:13:23,397
Yeah.

54
00:13:25,689 --> 00:13:28,283
-Been in the shelter?
-Yeah.

55
00:13:34,811 --> 00:13:36,130
Asshole...

56
00:13:37,452 --> 00:13:39,090
Here, go sleep.

57
00:13:43,173 --> 00:13:46,165
Some guy's bedded down over
there.

58
00:13:47,255 --> 00:13:49,405
Can't figure how he got in.

59
00:13:49,655 --> 00:13:51,805
Tomorrow, out on his ass!

60
00:17:33,233 --> 00:17:35,269
You! Come on...

61
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:37,148
Move it!

62
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:55,910
Pick up your shit!
And beat it!

63
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,479
Don't ever come back here! NEVER!

64
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:46,486
Miss!

65
00:19:01,896 --> 00:19:03,045
Shit!

66
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:14,931
That me there?

67
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:16,730
That me?

68
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:17,975
Yes...

69
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:20,379
from memory.

70
00:19:21,141 --> 00:19:22,779
Where'd you see me?

71
00:19:23,422 --> 00:19:25,458
Took you for dead.

72
00:19:28,503 --> 00:19:29,982
You give it to me?

73
00:19:31,184 --> 00:19:31,775
No...

74
00:19:44,187 --> 00:19:46,747
Really want it? Yes?...

75
00:19:48,028 --> 00:19:50,861
Pose for me, right now.
And you got it.

76
00:19:51,469 --> 00:19:52,743
A portrait.

77
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:37,520
Don't look at me...

78
00:20:40,642 --> 00:20:41,677
over there...

79
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:14,324
Julian... Julian...

80
00:21:16,571 --> 00:21:18,050
That's not me.

81
00:21:38,937 --> 00:21:40,575
My Michele.

82
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:45,291
I'm so worried.

83
00:21:45,499 --> 00:21:47,694
Howare you living? Where?

84
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:49,572
Your portraits ofJulian remain
here.

85
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,657
I look at them each night
and think ofyou.

86
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,377
Don't leave me without news.

87
00:21:54,581 --> 00:21:57,459
I love you, Marion.

88
00:23:10,201 --> 00:23:11,873
Night already...

89
00:23:17,042 --> 00:23:18,760
Passed out, huh?

90
00:23:20,363 --> 00:23:21,557
Was I drawing?

91
00:23:21,764 --> 00:23:22,879
Yeah.

92
00:23:27,885 --> 00:23:29,204
Louisiana...

93
00:23:32,326 --> 00:23:33,725
You bring me here?

94
00:23:33,927 --> 00:23:35,121
Yeah.

95
00:23:36,447 --> 00:23:38,438
What about the old guy who...?

96
00:23:38,648 --> 00:23:40,161
It's OK.

97
00:23:49,731 --> 00:23:51,210
Want to eat?

98
00:23:52,091 --> 00:23:53,570
Raw fish...

99
00:23:54,812 --> 00:23:56,325
Iike in Japan.

100
00:23:56,973 --> 00:23:58,452
Is it fresh?

101
00:24:00,654 --> 00:24:02,963
They call it "sushi"...

102
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:07,805
"Wake up, little sushi, wake up!"

103
00:24:16,338 --> 00:24:17,566
Have a name?

104
00:24:17,778 --> 00:24:19,006
Alex.

105
00:24:21,499 --> 00:24:23,933
One day, I'll draw you.

106
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:31,532
Got to sleep more.

107
00:24:35,903 --> 00:24:37,939
Sure it's OK here?

108
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,371
Yeah.

109
00:24:45,785 --> 00:24:46,774
Thanks.

110
00:24:58,989 --> 00:25:01,219
Tomorrow, out on her ass!

111
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,941
Fish again!

112
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:07,301
Where's Saint-Cloud?

113
00:25:07,951 --> 00:25:09,225
Saint-Cloud?

114
00:25:09,792 --> 00:25:12,590
Waywest... in the rich suburbs...

115
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:16,102
Why you asking?

116
00:25:16,313 --> 00:25:17,541
Nothing.

117
00:25:19,714 --> 00:25:22,911
The girl... she's gotta stay here.

118
00:25:23,395 --> 00:25:24,987
-Gotta stay.
-Hell, no!

119
00:25:25,236 --> 00:25:28,308
Couple of days... she's sick.

120
00:25:28,636 --> 00:25:30,467
Don't want her in my face!

121
00:25:32,037 --> 00:25:32,753
Why?

122
00:25:32,958 --> 00:25:35,267
DON'T WANT HER IN MY FACE!
GET IT?

123
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,476
Here, go sleep.

124
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:40,868
No!

125
00:25:50,562 --> 00:25:51,915
Give me your hand.

126
00:25:53,443 --> 00:25:54,842
The girl...

127
00:25:55,523 --> 00:25:57,320
just a couple of days.

128
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:02,514
No drink! Not a drop!

129
00:26:03,886 --> 00:26:07,037
Fix it so she's out of my face.

130
00:26:08,407 --> 00:26:09,726
Fix it, right?

131
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:17,167
Just a couple of days.

132
00:26:18,849 --> 00:26:20,328
Just a couple.

133
00:27:41,591 --> 00:27:42,467
Michele?

134
00:27:46,312 --> 00:27:47,665
Who's there?

135
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,791
What's it mean :

136
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,196
"First Love"?

137
00:28:26,723 --> 00:28:28,042
Julian...

138
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:36,161
only one she loved...

139
00:28:38,966 --> 00:28:40,763
"Love forever"...

140
00:28:42,967 --> 00:28:44,559
Don't get it...

141
00:28:51,689 --> 00:28:53,520
"First Love"...

142
00:28:59,211 --> 00:29:01,486
Drew him, over and over,

143
00:29:01,732 --> 00:29:03,370
only him...

144
00:29:04,012 --> 00:29:06,572
He played music for her,

145
00:29:07,693 --> 00:29:09,206
only her.

146
00:29:11,134 --> 00:29:13,364
Then something happened.

147
00:29:15,095 --> 00:29:16,574
Don't get it...

148
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:20,808
Fights...

149
00:29:21,177 --> 00:29:21,814
sad...

150
00:29:24,778 --> 00:29:25,574
Then...

151
00:29:25,778 --> 00:29:27,689
he drops her.

152
00:29:28,259 --> 00:29:31,012
She's waiting for him... so much...

153
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:34,938
That's why her eyes're so bad?

154
00:29:37,861 --> 00:29:39,658
Can't forget him...

155
00:29:41,302 --> 00:29:43,099
That why she loves him?

156
00:29:45,023 --> 00:29:46,297
That why she's in the street?

157
00:29:48,584 --> 00:29:49,619
Maybe looking for him?

158
00:30:06,869 --> 00:30:08,507
Done a good job!

159
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:47,158
Gotta go to work.

160
00:30:58,282 --> 00:31:00,159
Shit!...

161
00:31:07,444 --> 00:31:08,672
Here

162
00:31:09,285 --> 00:31:10,923
bought it for you.

163
00:31:12,086 --> 00:31:12,962
Uh?... Thanks.

164
00:31:13,166 --> 00:31:16,317
Don't have to go 'way
to get the news.

165
00:31:18,007 --> 00:31:19,645
Gotta go work.

166
00:31:20,768 --> 00:31:24,682
...city moves into high gear
for the 1789 Bicentennial...

167
00:35:51,478 --> 00:35:54,595
My spot! See you again,
I bust your cords!

168
00:35:54,839 --> 00:35:55,908
Beat it!

169
00:36:17,405 --> 00:36:18,633
Hi...

170
00:36:19,725 --> 00:36:21,920
See the guy playing the cello?

171
00:36:22,126 --> 00:36:24,321
Wasn't a guy... a lady...

172
00:36:24,927 --> 00:36:26,406
took the train...

173
00:36:27,887 --> 00:36:29,320
It can't be.

174
00:36:31,608 --> 00:36:33,087
A fat lady...

175
00:37:59,551 --> 00:38:01,030
Who's there?

176
00:38:01,792 --> 00:38:03,020
Michele.

177
00:38:04,192 --> 00:38:07,184
You? How'd you find me?

178
00:38:07,673 --> 00:38:09,026
Open up, Julian.

179
00:38:09,474 --> 00:38:11,544
I don't see you.

180
00:38:11,754 --> 00:38:12,982
Open up.

181
00:38:13,195 --> 00:38:16,073
No, we have to forget each other
now.

182
00:38:16,276 --> 00:38:17,675
I'm not asking for love.

183
00:38:17,876 --> 00:38:18,991
No!

184
00:38:20,197 --> 00:38:23,633
There's something
you don't know... about me.

185
00:38:24,638 --> 00:38:26,071
Don't be cruel.

186
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:29,672
Move your finger...

187
00:38:30,439 --> 00:38:34,273
I need to see you... one last time...

188
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,108
need to paint you.

189
00:38:36,321 --> 00:38:36,912
No!

190
00:38:37,121 --> 00:38:38,156
You can't refuse!

191
00:38:38,361 --> 00:38:39,430
No!

192
00:38:39,642 --> 00:38:40,870
Love...

193
00:38:41,322 --> 00:38:42,596
Love...

194
00:38:43,603 --> 00:38:46,037
If you refuse, you'll see...

195
00:40:13,946 --> 00:40:15,743
I'M THIRSTY TOO!

196
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:31,069
What's wrong?

197
00:40:32,151 --> 00:40:33,470
You know?

198
00:40:34,111 --> 00:40:35,100
Maybe... not sure...

199
00:40:35,312 --> 00:40:37,109
Not sure... No matter...

200
00:40:44,874 --> 00:40:46,944
We'll drink together,

201
00:40:48,475 --> 00:40:50,466
but not your way...

202
00:40:50,716 --> 00:40:53,788
Iike an old wino

203
00:40:58,678 --> 00:41:00,669
I want to be drunk with you,

204
00:41:00,878 --> 00:41:02,630
so I can see you laugh.

205
00:42:28,141 --> 00:42:31,133
FIRECRACKERS... FIREWORKS!

206
00:42:32,662 --> 00:42:34,493
Wait... wait...

207
00:42:44,585 --> 00:42:46,098
Where'd you get that?

208
00:42:46,306 --> 00:42:49,139
My dad's a colonel in the army.

209
00:42:51,507 --> 00:42:52,940
Shit...

210
00:42:53,187 --> 00:42:54,586
Take a look...

211
00:42:54,788 --> 00:42:56,221
No bullet missing?

212
00:42:56,428 --> 00:42:57,383
Yeah.

213
00:42:57,589 --> 00:42:58,226
YEAH, WHAT?

214
00:42:58,429 --> 00:42:59,578
No, none.

215
00:42:59,789 --> 00:43:02,587
All there, sure? Still 15?

216
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:04,588
15, yeah.

217
00:43:05,871 --> 00:43:08,066
Well, FINE!

218
00:43:09,992 --> 00:43:12,506
Dying to shoot, me too!

219
00:43:13,553 --> 00:43:15,669
Blow everything sky high.

220
00:43:16,553 --> 00:43:20,068
Let's do it. 7 for
you, 7 for me.

221
00:43:20,274 --> 00:43:22,469
Keep one for luck.

222
00:43:23,755 --> 00:43:24,346
CATCH!

223
00:43:26,076 --> 00:43:27,873
FIRE! GO ON!

224
00:43:49,162 --> 00:43:51,312
City's full of music.

225
00:43:51,923 --> 00:43:53,515
Want to join the crowd?

226
00:43:54,243 --> 00:43:55,835
No. Better here.

227
00:48:05,268 --> 00:48:06,257
SPEED OK?

228
00:48:07,869 --> 00:48:11,384
CAN'T HEAR,
BUT YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFUL!

229
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:04,530
You OK, Louisiana?

230
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:09,816
Cat Egyptian?

231
00:50:10,541 --> 00:50:12,099
Abyssinian.

232
00:50:13,902 --> 00:50:15,221
A gift.

233
00:50:17,423 --> 00:50:19,300
Dry me, boy.

234
00:50:32,146 --> 00:50:33,977
Real good you're here.

235
00:50:42,509 --> 00:50:44,420
Ready to drop right off.

236
00:50:48,471 --> 00:50:50,780
Never with wet hair.

237
00:50:58,233 --> 00:50:59,461
Here...

238
00:51:03,034 --> 00:51:04,626
throw it over the side.

239
00:51:06,675 --> 00:51:09,235
Gives you nightmares.

240
00:51:12,837 --> 00:51:14,156
Dump it.

241
00:51:27,881 --> 00:51:29,439
I'm zonked...

242
00:51:30,602 --> 00:51:31,921
Wait for me...

243
00:51:42,925 --> 00:51:44,916
Wake up, gotta sleep.

244
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:53,398
You pass me my downer?

245
00:51:53,728 --> 00:51:55,081
A downer!

246
00:51:59,289 --> 00:52:00,722
Can't find a snug fit?

247
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:03,484
Quick, need my downer.

248
00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:05,965
Too much drink. Doesn't mix.

249
00:52:06,171 --> 00:52:09,561
Yes... quick...
don't wanna be left alone.

250
00:52:12,933 --> 00:52:14,048
No!

251
00:52:15,053 --> 00:52:16,122
Go on!

252
00:52:18,374 --> 00:52:19,693
BEAT IT!

253
00:53:02,585 --> 00:53:04,541
Somebody loves you. If you say:

254
00:53:04,746 --> 00:53:06,623
"The sky is white," he'll say:

255
00:53:06,827 --> 00:53:08,545
"But the clouds are black."

256
00:53:08,747 --> 00:53:10,465
Then we'll know we're in love.

257
00:53:55,319 --> 00:53:57,628
Michele... Michele... Michele...

258
00:54:15,684 --> 00:54:18,596
Go on up. Tryto sleep.

259
00:54:18,885 --> 00:54:20,762
Can't.

260
00:54:22,126 --> 00:54:23,764
Want your downer?

261
00:54:23,967 --> 00:54:25,525
Too late.

262
00:54:30,168 --> 00:54:32,124
Girl doesn't love me.

263
00:54:32,729 --> 00:54:34,560
The girl doesn't WHAT?

264
00:54:37,770 --> 00:54:41,001
Cause you... you want love?

265
00:54:41,731 --> 00:54:43,084
Like the others?

266
00:54:43,612 --> 00:54:46,445
Tenderness, like the others?

267
00:54:47,653 --> 00:54:49,245
Look around...

268
00:54:49,453 --> 00:54:52,013
No love here!

269
00:54:53,374 --> 00:54:56,684
Love takes bedrooms,
not windy sidewalks!

270
00:54:58,135 --> 00:55:00,012
Got no life for it!

271
00:55:00,496 --> 00:55:02,487
So forget it.

272
00:55:02,737 --> 00:55:04,056
FORGET IT!

273
00:55:07,298 --> 00:55:09,289
The girl, she can't stay.

274
00:55:09,898 --> 00:55:11,616
Got to go!

275
00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:31,638
Leave me alone...

276
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,598
I'm hung over.

277
00:57:37,617 --> 00:57:39,130
You have to go.

278
00:57:42,258 --> 00:57:45,568
All you know how to say? Go?

279
00:57:46,619 --> 00:57:48,689
Think I'd be here, if not for...

280
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:52,134
a goddam reason? Go where?

281
00:57:53,621 --> 00:57:55,657
My eyes are going.

282
00:57:57,222 --> 00:57:58,450
Listen to me...

283
00:57:58,662 --> 00:58:00,334
When I try to paint,

284
00:58:00,863 --> 00:58:02,421
this eye here

285
00:58:03,543 --> 00:58:06,580
bulges out of my head,
like a snail.

286
00:58:12,346 --> 00:58:14,940
At the museum over there,

287
00:58:15,186 --> 00:58:17,416
I wanted to see a painting...

288
00:58:17,907 --> 00:58:20,899
See it again... before I'm blind.

289
00:58:21,348 --> 00:58:25,422
But a fucking neon
set the eye on fire,

290
00:58:26,269 --> 00:58:29,500
it hurt like hell... I couldn't see.

291
00:58:30,270 --> 00:58:33,626
Listen, maybe if you...

292
00:58:33,951 --> 00:58:35,179
Go fuck yourself

293
00:58:35,472 --> 00:58:36,700
with your "go"!

294
00:58:41,953 --> 00:58:43,181
Look at this...

295
00:58:52,716 --> 00:58:54,149
See that?

296
00:58:57,397 --> 00:58:59,308
30 years a guard.

297
00:59:02,279 --> 00:59:05,032
Factories, buildings,

298
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:09,155
cemeteries... It's all there.

299
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:17,758
One night, you and me,

300
00:59:18,163 --> 00:59:19,676
we'll go to the museum.

301
00:59:24,164 --> 00:59:26,075
I have the keys.

302
00:59:30,126 --> 00:59:33,323
You'll be able to see your picture,

303
00:59:35,007 --> 00:59:36,440
with a candle.

304
00:59:40,329 --> 00:59:43,366
So, you weren't always...?

305
00:59:46,210 --> 00:59:47,325
No.

306
00:59:49,891 --> 00:59:52,530
Steady job... a home...

307
00:59:53,892 --> 00:59:55,211
not bad-looking.

308
00:59:57,013 --> 00:59:58,924
Ladies called me "Camembert".

309
01:00:02,294 --> 01:00:03,886
Because of the smell?

310
01:00:06,895 --> 01:00:10,331
No, because I was ripe and ready.

311
01:00:43,305 --> 01:00:45,102
What was her name?

312
01:00:46,266 --> 01:00:47,585
Florence.

313
01:00:48,946 --> 01:00:50,823
Young, beautiful...

314
01:00:51,787 --> 01:00:54,096
made life beautiful.

315
01:00:55,748 --> 01:00:57,818
Always liked a drink...

316
01:00:58,029 --> 01:00:59,781
high spirits...

317
01:01:03,830 --> 01:01:06,788
But after our little girl died,

318
01:01:06,991 --> 01:01:09,710
she downed more and more,
joyless.

319
01:01:12,312 --> 01:01:14,507
How do you stop it?

320
01:01:18,314 --> 01:01:20,270
Not that she didn't love me...

321
01:01:21,515 --> 01:01:24,632
But the pain inched between us.

322
01:01:24,836 --> 01:01:28,431
Couldn't look at me without tears.

323
01:01:33,478 --> 01:01:36,550
One day she up and left.

324
01:01:38,399 --> 01:01:40,435
For weeks I searched...

325
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:42,472
and I found her...

326
01:01:43,721 --> 01:01:45,313
Wreckage!

327
01:01:47,001 --> 01:01:49,595
Days in the streets,

328
01:01:49,802 --> 01:01:51,758
nights in a train station.

329
01:01:54,643 --> 01:01:56,474
I stuck with her...

330
01:01:57,964 --> 01:01:59,602
followed her...

331
01:02:01,005 --> 01:02:02,404
She died at 33...

332
01:02:04,326 --> 01:02:06,317
and looked 50.

333
01:02:09,167 --> 01:02:11,727
I threw her body in the river.

334
01:02:12,968 --> 01:02:15,641
Yes, your Honor...

335
01:02:16,529 --> 01:02:20,443
over there, near the barges she
loved.

336
01:02:25,291 --> 01:02:27,247
Resembled you a bit...

337
01:02:28,932 --> 01:02:30,650
not the nose.

338
01:02:32,253 --> 01:02:34,767
That's why you can't stand me.

339
01:02:36,214 --> 01:02:37,613
Look...

340
01:02:38,455 --> 01:02:40,366
a woman who sleeps rough

341
01:02:40,735 --> 01:02:43,886
gets beat up, raped,

342
01:02:44,456 --> 01:02:47,653
periods don't come,

343
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:50,930
drinks to forget till she's numb!

344
01:02:51,938 --> 01:02:52,893
Life outside,

345
01:02:54,139 --> 01:02:56,812
it's right for me, for Alex.

346
01:02:57,020 --> 01:02:59,454
But impossible for you!

347
01:02:59,660 --> 01:03:01,139
You have to go

348
01:03:01,901 --> 01:03:04,654
and... LIVE!

349
01:03:31,068 --> 01:03:32,899
The sky is white today.

350
01:03:35,670 --> 01:03:37,262
The sky is white.

351
01:03:43,272 --> 01:03:44,625
But the clouds are black!

352
01:05:20,377 --> 01:05:22,015
Say "Michele,"

353
01:05:23,938 --> 01:05:25,815
Call me "Michele."

354
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:32,618
Stay with me .

355
01:05:46,384 --> 01:05:47,737
Wait!

356
01:05:52,545 --> 01:05:54,775
Got to be patient with me.

357
01:05:57,066 --> 01:06:00,695
I'll tell you stuff one day...
about me.

358
01:06:04,748 --> 01:06:08,058
We'll make love,
sure we will, but not yet...

359
01:06:09,229 --> 01:06:10,628
Iater...

360
01:06:16,031 --> 01:06:17,510
Wanna go walk?

361
01:06:17,712 --> 01:06:20,180
Whole city's asleep...

362
01:06:20,512 --> 01:06:21,661
Yeah, let's walk!

363
01:07:57,978 --> 01:07:59,127
It's quick?

364
01:07:59,338 --> 01:08:01,454
Real quick. Real powerful.

365
01:08:01,659 --> 01:08:02,978
Take it often?

366
01:08:03,179 --> 01:08:05,056
Can't sleep without it.

367
01:08:05,340 --> 01:08:06,739
What's the taste?

368
01:08:06,940 --> 01:08:08,498
No taste.

369
01:08:10,861 --> 01:08:11,452
Got an idea.

370
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:32,745
No more swallowing this poison.

371
01:08:33,827 --> 01:08:36,785
I'll teach you to sleep...

372
01:08:37,308 --> 01:08:38,900
with me.

373
01:11:07,907 --> 01:11:10,467
ANOTHER $ 150!

374
01:11:11,108 --> 01:11:13,099
LET'S SPEND IT!

375
01:11:14,709 --> 01:11:16,779
EVER SEEN THE SEA?

376
01:11:16,989 --> 01:11:17,580
No, but...

377
01:11:17,790 --> 01:11:19,018
THE HORIZON?

378
01:11:19,230 --> 01:11:20,345
No need...

379
01:11:20,550 --> 01:11:21,903
COME ON!

380
01:11:48,518 --> 01:11:50,907
The sea! The sea!

381
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:00,233
It's wet!... It's wet!...

382
01:12:34,369 --> 01:12:36,724
I'm about to drop off.

383
01:12:41,651 --> 01:12:42,925
Didn't forget something?

384
01:12:44,732 --> 01:12:45,960
Huh? Oh yeah...

385
01:13:05,297 --> 01:13:06,650
Here.

386
01:13:14,420 --> 01:13:16,012
Good night, Love.

387
01:13:20,301 --> 01:13:23,850
I'm proud I taught you to sleep...

388
01:13:25,223 --> 01:13:27,020
that it was me...

389
01:13:31,864 --> 01:13:33,582
proof of our love.

390
01:14:09,794 --> 01:14:11,944
I can't see the horizon...

391
01:14:12,515 --> 01:14:14,710
My eye's too weak now.

392
01:14:15,756 --> 01:14:19,875
But you... you only look at your
feet.

393
01:14:22,357 --> 01:14:24,313
Wanna go back to the bridge.

394
01:14:35,681 --> 01:14:37,433
Still asleep?

395
01:14:37,801 --> 01:14:38,756
No.

396
01:14:49,404 --> 01:14:51,042
My eye is worse.

397
01:14:53,766 --> 01:14:54,801
Want an apple?

398
01:14:56,046 --> 01:14:56,922
Not now.

399
01:15:04,008 --> 01:15:04,963
You count it?

400
01:15:10,570 --> 01:15:12,128
God, I'm stiff...

401
01:15:16,091 --> 01:15:18,651
Gonna end up like an old bag!

402
01:15:26,814 --> 01:15:28,247
Almost 2 thousand!

403
01:15:29,495 --> 01:15:32,646
Think of what we can do!
Bridge's...

404
01:15:33,616 --> 01:15:36,005
fine in summer, but winter...

405
01:15:36,217 --> 01:15:38,048
We'll go under.

406
01:15:38,737 --> 01:15:40,614
Stinks down there.

407
01:15:56,062 --> 01:15:58,053
Oh! Hey! Peanut,

408
01:15:58,942 --> 01:16:01,661
Where? Don't know.

409
01:16:06,584 --> 01:16:09,974
Oh! Hey! Peanut!

410
01:16:10,185 --> 01:16:13,143
Where? Don't know.

411
01:16:39,033 --> 01:16:40,671
The money?

412
01:16:44,474 --> 01:16:45,748
NO!...

413
01:16:48,715 --> 01:16:52,185
Fucking clumsy cunt!

414
01:16:52,396 --> 01:16:53,954
BLIND!

415
01:17:01,759 --> 01:17:03,397
I'm no good anymore.

416
01:17:12,121 --> 01:17:13,793
Sorry, Alex.

417
01:17:25,365 --> 01:17:27,003
First floor.

418
01:17:27,485 --> 01:17:28,838
I know.

419
01:17:46,850 --> 01:17:48,203
This way.

420
01:17:49,051 --> 01:17:50,928
Stop saying "Shh!"

421
01:17:51,932 --> 01:17:53,843
Stop... Shh!

422
01:18:00,454 --> 01:18:02,285
Your shoes squeak...

423
01:18:12,857 --> 01:18:14,370
You here?

424
01:18:14,658 --> 01:18:16,137
Come on...

425
01:18:16,778 --> 01:18:18,575
Take you back.

426
01:18:23,180 --> 01:18:24,499
Michele...

427
01:18:29,382 --> 01:18:30,735
Michele...

428
01:18:37,664 --> 01:18:39,017
It's there...

429
01:18:43,945 --> 01:18:45,378
Turn that off.

430
01:18:56,148 --> 01:18:57,467
Can't see.

431
01:19:02,910 --> 01:19:04,343
Let's go!

432
01:19:05,151 --> 01:19:09,782
Where are you? Where?

433
01:19:10,352 --> 01:19:11,751
You're where?

434
01:19:21,595 --> 01:19:22,630
HEY, YOU!

435
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:40,995
You OK?

436
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:42,997
Forget about me.

437
01:19:43,881 --> 01:19:45,473
Just look.

438
01:21:02,501 --> 01:21:04,571
Got to go back to the bridge.

439
01:22:23,962 --> 01:22:25,315
Try not...

440
01:22:25,643 --> 01:22:27,634
to suffer that way...

441
01:22:46,568 --> 01:22:48,684
Want to be with you.

442
01:22:48,969 --> 01:22:50,607
Really want to.

443
01:22:53,650 --> 01:22:55,527
But you're so closed.

444
01:23:00,052 --> 01:23:01,804
Got to open up!

445
01:23:24,978 --> 01:23:26,093
NEVER DO THAT AGAIN!

446
01:24:20,793 --> 01:24:23,182
We're gonna stick, you and me.

447
01:24:24,794 --> 01:24:27,945
When it all goes black soon,

448
01:24:28,835 --> 01:24:30,985
you'll be my last image,

449
01:24:34,156 --> 01:24:36,590
Who else in your head?

450
01:24:36,797 --> 01:24:38,628
Not many.

451
01:24:38,837 --> 01:24:40,156
Who?

452
01:24:41,838 --> 01:24:44,113
Faces in paintings...

453
01:24:44,799 --> 01:24:45,834
my parents...

454
01:24:46,479 --> 01:24:48,470
my old friend Marion...

455
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:50,592
my cat...

456
01:24:53,201 --> 01:24:54,839
and then Hans...

457
01:24:58,162 --> 01:25:02,202
and a boy whose name was Julian...

458
01:25:02,443 --> 01:25:04,320
is Julian.

459
01:25:05,804 --> 01:25:07,840
Must tell you sometime.

460
01:25:08,045 --> 01:25:09,797
It'd be good.

461
01:25:15,407 --> 01:25:16,806
You know,

462
01:25:18,007 --> 01:25:21,397
I'm ready to live in the dark.

463
01:25:22,009 --> 01:25:26,288
Because, right now,
the world's just a lot of...

464
01:25:26,650 --> 01:25:29,244
blurry dancing flames...

465
01:25:30,451 --> 01:25:32,169
and I'm sick of it!

466
01:25:40,173 --> 01:25:43,165
You'll be there? My white cane?

467
01:25:46,895 --> 01:25:48,965
My seeing-eye dog?

468
01:25:51,336 --> 01:25:52,974
Playing dog?

469
01:25:58,618 --> 01:26:00,893
Already can't see small things.

470
01:26:01,099 --> 01:26:04,330
They're the most exciting.

471
01:26:07,020 --> 01:26:09,818
A little smile's invisible.

472
01:26:11,021 --> 01:26:13,137
Got to make it big...

473
01:26:14,942 --> 01:26:17,172
Make it all big for me.

474
01:26:20,784 --> 01:26:22,137
Wait.

475
01:26:23,384 --> 01:26:25,022
Where you going?

476
01:26:25,745 --> 01:26:27,417
What're you doing?

477
01:26:28,266 --> 01:26:29,858
See me?

478
01:26:30,706 --> 01:26:32,139
Michele?

479
01:26:32,547 --> 01:26:33,218
I see you...

480
01:26:43,750 --> 01:26:44,739
Clown...

481
01:26:57,873 --> 01:26:59,306
Where are you?

482
01:27:01,234 --> 01:27:03,623
Cops are checking. Don't like it.

483
01:27:04,635 --> 01:27:06,227
Taking you back.

484
01:27:11,077 --> 01:27:12,556
Whythe bum's rush?

485
01:27:12,997 --> 01:27:14,225
Sorry...

486
01:27:23,080 --> 01:27:25,913
Michele Stalens, missing for 6
months,

487
01:27:26,121 --> 01:27:28,316
suffers from a rare eye disease.
Dr. Destouches'

488
01:27:28,521 --> 01:27:30,910
new operation could save her
Every day counts!

489
01:30:30,128 --> 01:30:32,084
See, Louisiana...

490
01:30:32,489 --> 01:30:34,480
a loose wire...

491
01:30:37,170 --> 01:30:39,206
Alex'll fix it.

492
01:30:44,732 --> 01:30:45,369
Speak...

493
01:30:46,933 --> 01:30:48,491
of the devil.

494
01:30:55,975 --> 01:30:57,328
Hold me.

495
01:31:01,537 --> 01:31:03,528
Radio's on the blink.

496
01:31:04,897 --> 01:31:06,649
Got your coat on.

497
01:31:07,218 --> 01:31:09,493
I got scared, Michele.

498
01:31:11,099 --> 01:31:13,613
In the rain, had a bad dream.

499
01:31:13,900 --> 01:31:15,333
Hold me.

500
01:31:18,221 --> 01:31:21,577
It was night.
You weren't on the bridge...

501
01:31:23,382 --> 01:31:25,452
but lost in the dark.

502
01:31:26,103 --> 01:31:28,697
Couldn't find you in the dark...

503
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:33,219
But I'm here.

504
01:31:34,425 --> 01:31:35,653
Hold me...

505
01:31:36,106 --> 01:31:39,542
... Colonel Stalens' daughter,

506
01:31:41,347 --> 01:31:44,384
24, 5'6", brown hair...

507
01:31:44,588 --> 01:31:46,624
Michele's sight
can perhaps be saved...

508
01:31:46,828 --> 01:31:49,661
Dr. Destouches' new operation...

509
01:31:49,869 --> 01:31:53,225
Any information concerning her...

510
01:31:53,430 --> 01:31:54,749
The radio!

511
01:31:55,511 --> 01:31:58,309
You hear? Talking about me!

512
01:31:59,111 --> 01:32:00,703
MY EYES!

513
01:32:09,674 --> 01:32:11,346
A hope...

514
01:32:16,516 --> 01:32:18,313
if ever...

515
01:32:18,797 --> 01:32:20,674
Could it be?

516
01:32:22,518 --> 01:32:24,827
The end of this nightmare...

517
01:32:28,279 --> 01:32:29,632
Just think, Alex,

518
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:33,118
MY EYES!

519
01:33:00,968 --> 01:33:02,321
Come,

520
01:33:02,808 --> 01:33:04,526
let's share a bottle...

521
01:33:28,335 --> 01:33:29,404
Another one?

522
01:33:29,615 --> 01:33:30,650
Yeah...

523
01:34:51,196 --> 01:34:52,515
Alex...

524
01:37:07,111 --> 01:37:09,784
ALEX, NEVER LOVED YOU.
NOT REALLY.

525
01:37:09,992 --> 01:37:11,664
FORGET ME. MICHELE

526
01:37:36,279 --> 01:37:38,713
No one...

527
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:42,030
can teach me...

528
01:37:42,601 --> 01:37:44,114
to forget.

529
01:37:59,525 --> 01:38:00,878
Get up!

530
01:38:01,605 --> 01:38:02,594
Come on!

531
01:38:08,127 --> 01:38:09,401
You Alex Vogan?

532
01:38:13,809 --> 01:38:14,639
Let's go...

533
01:38:14,849 --> 01:38:16,885
Talk about a guy who fried.

534
01:38:17,090 --> 01:38:17,727
TALK!

535
01:38:17,930 --> 01:38:18,646
TALK!

536
01:38:20,290 --> 01:38:21,484
KID SAW YOU!

537
01:38:23,771 --> 01:38:24,999
PIECE OF SHIT!

538
01:38:29,213 --> 01:38:30,646
The defendant will rise!

539
01:38:31,213 --> 01:38:33,124
The jury finds you guilty

540
01:38:33,334 --> 01:38:36,212
of manslaughter...

541
01:38:36,495 --> 01:38:39,965
and sentences you
to 3 years in prison.

542
01:38:54,579 --> 01:38:55,853
VOGAN!

543
01:39:00,941 --> 01:39:01,976
Call Vogan...

544
01:40:06,998 --> 01:40:09,068
Nearly 2 years...

545
01:40:16,801 --> 01:40:18,598
Knew it was me?

546
01:40:22,882 --> 01:40:24,440
Want me to go?

547
01:40:29,604 --> 01:40:31,481
Had to see you...

548
01:40:33,445 --> 01:40:35,754
Wanted you to see me...

549
01:40:37,206 --> 01:40:38,639
my eyes...

550
01:40:42,567 --> 01:40:44,125
Not talking?

551
01:40:48,569 --> 01:40:50,002
I like your face...

552
01:40:52,050 --> 01:40:53,961
Strange to see you...

553
01:40:54,810 --> 01:40:56,368
just like in my...

554
01:40:59,652 --> 01:41:01,882
Thought I'd forgotten you.

555
01:41:04,373 --> 01:41:07,012
But every night for weeks...

556
01:41:07,214 --> 01:41:09,603
images of you.

557
01:41:10,655 --> 01:41:12,805
That's why I'm here.

558
01:41:14,496 --> 01:41:16,612
My dreams sent me.

559
01:41:20,377 --> 01:41:24,086
People in dreams,
ought to call them when you wake.

560
01:41:24,658 --> 01:41:26,967
Make life simpler.

561
01:41:28,939 --> 01:41:31,055
"Hello, dreamed ofyou."

562
01:41:31,740 --> 01:41:33,696
Love woke me.

563
01:41:38,502 --> 01:41:40,254
You look at me.

564
01:41:43,583 --> 01:41:45,858
Wonder who I was.

565
01:41:47,504 --> 01:41:49,460
Don't know me.

566
01:41:53,386 --> 01:41:56,981
But I imagined you in every
detail...

567
01:41:57,187 --> 01:41:58,984
even your hair...

568
01:42:00,988 --> 01:42:03,183
it's grown...

569
01:42:04,869 --> 01:42:07,781
Same shining eyes as in my
dreams...

570
01:42:08,670 --> 01:42:10,945
we were both running,

571
01:42:12,471 --> 01:42:14,063
through cities,

572
01:42:15,111 --> 01:42:17,022
valleys and plains...

573
01:42:17,552 --> 01:42:20,624
And you didn't limp anymore.

574
01:42:22,673 --> 01:42:24,311
Don't limp anymore.

575
01:42:24,514 --> 01:42:25,503
What?

576
01:42:25,714 --> 01:42:27,352
Don't limp.

577
01:42:30,355 --> 01:42:31,754
You see,

578
01:42:32,316 --> 01:42:34,511
nothing's... irremediable.

579
01:42:37,717 --> 01:42:41,426
Went to the bridge last night...
All repaired.

580
01:42:41,638 --> 01:42:43,708
Now it's solid.

581
01:42:46,359 --> 01:42:48,509
Why'd you tryto forget me?

582
01:42:58,963 --> 01:43:01,352
Never told you about me...

583
01:43:04,604 --> 01:43:07,198
we led such a strange life...

584
01:43:09,365 --> 01:43:11,640
Why'd you never come to see me?

585
01:43:15,887 --> 01:43:17,605
I waited.

586
01:43:23,329 --> 01:43:26,719
I'm afraid of us... at times

587
01:43:27,810 --> 01:43:29,209
often...

588
01:43:31,811 --> 01:43:33,244
You're weak...

589
01:43:36,052 --> 01:43:37,280
No...

590
01:43:39,813 --> 01:43:41,405
Can you love me?

591
01:43:42,214 --> 01:43:44,489
Yeah, like before,

592
01:43:44,694 --> 01:43:46,525
but not the same.

593
01:43:47,975 --> 01:43:49,044
I'll visit you...

594
01:43:49,256 --> 01:43:50,450
Never, not here.

595
01:43:50,656 --> 01:43:51,566
I miss you.

596
01:43:51,776 --> 01:43:55,816
so many things to fix...
inside me.

597
01:43:56,698 --> 01:43:58,017
Want to be ready for you...

598
01:43:58,218 --> 01:43:58,809
A new man...

599
01:43:59,018 --> 01:43:59,928
When I get out...

600
01:44:00,138 --> 01:44:00,854
Six months...

601
01:44:01,059 --> 01:44:01,969
Christmas, yes...

602
01:44:02,179 --> 01:44:04,568
Midnight on the bridge...

603
01:44:04,780 --> 01:44:06,054
To do your portrait.

604
01:44:06,260 --> 01:44:07,818
- With wine.
- Good wine!

605
01:44:08,021 --> 01:44:09,295
No poison in it!

606
01:44:09,501 --> 01:44:12,379
A room in a hotel. I have money.

607
01:44:12,902 --> 01:44:15,257
Breakfast in bed... You'll see,

608
01:44:15,462 --> 01:44:18,454
butter on our thighs,
jam on our bellies,

609
01:44:20,024 --> 01:44:22,254
crumbs stuck to our...

610
01:44:55,113 --> 01:44:57,786
DR. DESTOUCHES
EYE SURGEON

611
01:45:17,278 --> 01:45:18,597
Louisiana...

612
01:47:45,637 --> 01:47:47,593
I'm on your eyes.

613
01:47:57,240 --> 01:47:58,832
I'm on your mouth...

614
01:48:09,763 --> 01:48:11,242
Done!

615
01:48:13,724 --> 01:48:14,952
I'll do better...

616
01:48:24,367 --> 01:48:25,846
Like yourself?

617
01:48:27,848 --> 01:48:29,076
Yes.

618
01:48:36,370 --> 01:48:38,520
Yes yes or yes no?

619
01:48:38,811 --> 01:48:40,039
Yes.

620
01:48:50,894 --> 01:48:51,770
Oh! Shit!

621
01:48:52,414 --> 01:48:55,133
Clumsy! Take off your mitten.

622
01:48:55,535 --> 01:48:56,650
No. It's OK.

623
01:48:58,336 --> 01:48:58,973
YOU LOOK HAPPY!

624
01:48:59,176 --> 01:49:00,450
YES!

625
01:49:00,976 --> 01:49:03,570
LOADED... ON LOVE!

626
01:49:08,218 --> 01:49:09,617
Know the happy man story?

627
01:49:12,900 --> 01:49:14,936
Two guys in a bar...

628
01:49:15,460 --> 01:49:19,294
really down... wonder
if they fuck enough to be happy.

629
01:49:20,141 --> 01:49:22,132
So, the first one says,

630
01:49:22,382 --> 01:49:25,374
"Me, I get it every two weeks."

631
01:49:25,583 --> 01:49:28,814
The second one says,
"Me, once a month."

632
01:49:30,064 --> 01:49:31,736
Not a hell of a lot...

633
01:49:35,105 --> 01:49:37,665
But there's this third guy at the
bar,

634
01:49:41,067 --> 01:49:42,625
all alone,

635
01:49:42,867 --> 01:49:46,018
huge grin on his face... ear to ear.

636
01:49:49,029 --> 01:49:51,259
Guys wonder... why's he so happy?

637
01:49:51,470 --> 01:49:52,983
So...

638
01:49:56,311 --> 01:50:00,099
not easy...
they ask how often he has sex.

639
01:50:00,632 --> 01:50:03,430
The guy, beaming, says,
"My friends...

640
01:50:05,473 --> 01:50:09,387
I make love every three years."

641
01:50:12,475 --> 01:50:14,625
"What? Every three years?

642
01:50:14,916 --> 01:50:17,555
So why're you so happy?"

643
01:50:18,357 --> 01:50:20,075
And the third guy says,

644
01:50:23,398 --> 01:50:25,309
"Because tonight's the night!"

645
01:50:30,440 --> 01:50:32,032
Because tonight's the night...

646
01:50:35,961 --> 01:50:37,519
Oh... my head hurts.

647
01:50:41,082 --> 01:50:42,515
Tonight's the night...

648
01:50:42,723 --> 01:50:44,395
Tonight's the night...

649
01:51:01,968 --> 01:51:03,606
3 o'clock?

650
01:51:05,049 --> 01:51:06,926
Didn't hear 2.

651
01:51:07,209 --> 01:51:09,120
Tonight's the night.

652
01:51:09,330 --> 01:51:11,241
Alex, I have to go...

653
01:51:12,571 --> 01:51:14,050
I'm dead...

654
01:51:16,652 --> 01:51:18,483
Love, what's wrong?

655
01:51:20,693 --> 01:51:22,046
It's not true.

656
01:51:22,253 --> 01:51:23,003
What?

657
01:51:23,213 --> 01:51:24,362
You're not tired.

658
01:51:24,574 --> 01:51:25,802
Yes... I'm tired.

659
01:51:28,695 --> 01:51:30,606
Little hotel nearby,

660
01:51:30,975 --> 01:51:33,250
Louisiana, same as your cat.

661
01:51:33,576 --> 01:51:34,725
I asked...

662
01:51:35,617 --> 01:51:38,290
they serve breakfast in bed.

663
01:51:38,937 --> 01:51:40,734
Love, have to go.

664
01:51:41,658 --> 01:51:42,977
Where?

665
01:51:43,179 --> 01:51:44,658
I'll tell you.

666
01:51:44,859 --> 01:51:46,258
WHAT?

667
01:51:47,540 --> 01:51:48,973
Don't shout!

668
01:51:50,260 --> 01:51:53,570
Some things... take time...

669
01:51:55,062 --> 01:51:57,622
Don't make me say, not tonight.

670
01:51:58,783 --> 01:52:00,421
You're killing me.

671
01:52:01,343 --> 01:52:03,732
Got to be patient with me.

672
01:52:04,864 --> 01:52:06,263
No!

673
01:52:11,506 --> 01:52:12,575
Lies...

674
01:52:15,427 --> 01:52:16,826
Lies...

675
01:52:19,188 --> 01:52:19,904
LIES!

676
01:53:39,249 --> 01:53:40,477
MICHELE!

677
01:54:14,018 --> 01:54:15,451
Are you sand dealers?

678
01:54:15,778 --> 01:54:18,008
We just haul it.

679
01:54:18,899 --> 01:54:21,129
Our last trip.

680
01:54:35,983 --> 01:54:38,338
Where're you bound?

681
01:54:38,584 --> 01:54:39,778
All the way...

682
01:54:39,984 --> 01:54:41,463
To the Atlantic.

683
01:54:44,746 --> 01:54:46,179
The Atlantic...

684
01:54:47,626 --> 01:54:49,105
We are too...

685
01:54:52,308 --> 01:54:53,866
Right?

686
01:55:00,750 --> 01:55:02,741
OK if we come along?

687
01:55:03,631 --> 01:55:05,269
Can be arranged.

688
01:55:46,362 --> 01:55:49,354
Oh! Hey! Peanut,

689
01:55:49,562 --> 01:55:52,076
Oh! Hey! Don't know...

690
01:56:22,691 --> 01:56:25,489
LET PARIS ROT!
