1
00:00:29,431 --> 00:00:30,581
Good to see you Al.

2
00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:31,790
Welcome! Welcome!

3
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:33,110
I'm so happy you're here.

4
00:00:33,111 --> 00:00:34,500
C'mon right through.

5
00:00:34,551 --> 00:00:37,190
Feel free to go wherever you like
and make yourselves at home

6
00:00:37,191 --> 00:00:38,467
Thanks a lot Al.

7
00:00:38,511 --> 00:00:41,141
Whaddya think, Muriel?
Isn't this beautiful land?

8
00:00:41,431 --> 00:00:43,310
I think the place has a lot of potential.

9
00:00:43,311 --> 00:00:47,147
I can't believe it. It's just perfect,
exactly how you described it.

10
00:00:47,191 --> 00:00:49,950
What a neat place. Is this the one
we're gonna buy, dad?

11
00:00:49,951 --> 00:00:52,030
I sure hope so. Do you like it, Hamal?

12
00:00:52,031 --> 00:00:53,270
I love it this much.

13
00:00:53,271 --> 00:00:54,581
How about you Hasan?

14
00:00:54,711 --> 00:00:56,430
Hmmm, well the soil is rich.

15
00:00:56,591 --> 00:00:58,219
It's located near a nice river...

16
00:00:58,711 --> 00:01:01,625
...but it's gonna be a ton of work huh?

17
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:06,628
We've got work to do. Move, Cleo.
I said move you stubborn beast!

18
00:01:06,671 --> 00:01:12,782
C'mon, let's go! Don't be such a pain
in the neck! Ehhh, ah, ahhh!

19
00:01:14,391 --> 00:01:17,066
What a strange man!
Do you know him, Mr. Saleh?

20
00:01:17,351 --> 00:01:19,343
Of course I know him,
It's just Enad

21
00:01:19,551 --> 00:01:22,630
Over here, Enad! You should take a break.
Come in! Come in!

22
00:01:22,631 --> 00:01:26,421
Thanks for the invite pal,
but I've got a lot of work to do.

23
00:01:26,471 --> 00:01:29,180
What is your problem mule!? Quiet!

24
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:31,260
He's one of the neighbours.

25
00:01:31,311 --> 00:01:33,941
By the way, all the neighbours are
great and helpful to each other

26
00:01:33,991 --> 00:01:37,144
But this Enad is definitely
a bit of a character.

27
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:38,507
Does he live nearby?

28
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:39,941
He lives next door.

29
00:01:40,351 --> 00:01:41,710
Uh, let's have a look at the house now.

30
00:01:41,711 --> 00:01:42,861
Good idea.

31
00:01:43,591 --> 00:01:45,743
Uhh, the house looks like it needs
a lot of work.

32
00:01:45,831 --> 00:01:49,109
You're right, Hasan. Actually, it hasn't
been lived in for many years.

33
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:54,948
Uhh oh hee hee hee. Let's go inside now.
Come in.

34
00:01:56,711 --> 00:02:00,148
Oh, I don't know, Amine, look at the walls.
They're in terrible shape.

35
00:02:00,551 --> 00:02:02,430
I know, but we can fix them up quickly.

36
00:02:03,191 --> 00:02:05,229
Well, what did'ya think of the inside?

37
00:02:05,551 --> 00:02:06,910
Uh, it's not bad.

38
00:02:06,911 --> 00:02:08,983
Uh, now we just need to discuss the price.

39
00:02:09,111 --> 00:02:12,190
I thought we already had an agreement.
Isn't that right, Amine?

40
00:02:12,191 --> 00:02:14,590
Uh, yes we did but the house it's,
well, ah, it's...

41
00:02:14,591 --> 00:02:17,949
In need of a lot of repair, right mom?

42
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,748
Oh... yes, but, uh you tell him, Amine.

43
00:02:21,111 --> 00:02:22,990
Is there a problem?

44
00:02:23,631 --> 00:02:26,630
Uh, well, we really can't afford the
price we agreed to.

45
00:02:26,631 --> 00:02:29,829
Not a problem, Amine.
How much can you afford?

46
00:02:29,831 --> 00:02:30,830
About three quarters, and...

47
00:02:30,831 --> 00:02:32,030
And all my jewelry.

48
00:02:32,031 --> 00:02:35,468
No! Keep your jewelry.
Why don't I wait 'till after the harvest.

49
00:02:35,631 --> 00:02:38,829
You're a good man, Al. Thanks a lot.
I'll never forget this.

50
00:02:39,031 --> 00:02:41,820
Hooray! The place is ours!

51
00:03:16,271 --> 00:03:18,184
What a beautiful morning it is today.

52
00:03:18,951 --> 00:03:19,870
Good morning, mommy.

53
00:03:19,871 --> 00:03:21,101
Good morning, sweetheart.

54
00:03:54,431 --> 00:03:57,106
Aaaahhh!

55
00:03:59,591 --> 00:04:02,141
Oh no, what happened to my egg?

56
00:04:02,311 --> 00:04:06,624
Oh, oh, oh, oh, look at the precious.

57
00:04:07,231 --> 00:04:09,587
Oh, no...

58
00:04:09,871 --> 00:04:13,183
Oh no, this just isn't fair.

59
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:16,704
Somebody come quick. Help!

60
00:04:16,831 --> 00:04:17,790
Look, look at my egg.

61
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:22,264
What did you have another nightmare about
a chicken crossing the road? Haaah...

62
00:04:23,071 --> 00:04:24,108
What!

63
00:04:24,151 --> 00:04:27,782
La, la, la, la, la, la,

64
00:04:27,831 --> 00:04:30,745
La, la, la, la, la, la.

65
00:04:32,351 --> 00:04:33,786
Hey.

66
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,781
Hey, hey.

67
00:04:41,271 --> 00:04:43,468
La, la, la, la, la, la.

68
00:04:43,831 --> 00:04:44,788
Hey, hey.

69
00:04:47,551 --> 00:04:48,542
Hey.

70
00:04:48,751 --> 00:04:50,150
Rise and shine the day is fine...

71
00:04:50,151 --> 00:04:52,223
...the morning's underway.

72
00:04:52,831 --> 00:04:54,584
Come with me come and see...

73
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:56,161
...the beauty of this day.

74
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:57,864
Come along my friends.

75
00:04:58,031 --> 00:04:58,950
we have a lot of work to do.

76
00:04:58,951 --> 00:04:59,988
Let's go.

77
00:05:05,391 --> 00:05:06,507
The sun is rising.

78
00:05:07,431 --> 00:05:08,900
It shines for you and me.

79
00:05:09,591 --> 00:05:10,430
It makes us smile...

80
00:05:10,431 --> 00:05:12,150
...at everyone we see.

81
00:05:15,831 --> 00:05:18,270
This poor old house needs a lot of work...

82
00:05:18,271 --> 00:05:19,706
...we better start right away

83
00:05:24,111 --> 00:05:27,628
This old farm had better days.
It's been forgotten.

84
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:31,105
I'll plant some flower seeds today.

85
00:05:32,551 --> 00:05:34,384
We'll watch them grow up to the sky.

86
00:05:34,551 --> 00:05:37,260
As each passing day and night goes by...

87
00:05:42,751 --> 00:05:44,584
We'll work to fix our home...

88
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,664
...with bricks and wood and stone.

89
00:05:47,031 --> 00:05:51,140
We're happy and we're proud of this
home that we have found.

90
00:05:51,271 --> 00:05:53,150
With our hands we'll do it all.

91
00:05:53,431 --> 00:05:57,787
Fix the roof and build the walls.

92
00:05:59,751 --> 00:06:00,630
Work hard, don't stop,

93
00:06:00,631 --> 00:06:01,747
let's go on.

94
00:06:02,031 --> 00:06:03,830
We'll keep working till we're done.

95
00:06:03,951 --> 00:06:05,864
Let's keep working till we're done.

96
00:06:06,111 --> 00:06:07,830
We won't rest untill we're done.

97
00:06:07,831 --> 00:06:10,108
We'll work together it will be fun.

98
00:06:10,311 --> 00:06:12,224
Let's pitch in, we're almost finished.

99
00:06:12,391 --> 00:06:14,110
The pride will show, the pain will go.

100
00:06:14,231 --> 00:06:16,144
Let's build our future on these hopes.

101
00:06:16,311 --> 00:06:18,429
Let's build our future in this home.

102
00:06:18,431 --> 00:06:20,423
Let's pitch in, we're almost finished.

103
00:06:20,511 --> 00:06:22,424
The pride will show, the pain will go.

104
00:06:22,431 --> 00:06:24,503
Let's build our future on these hopes.

105
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,424
Let's build our future in this home.

106
00:06:26,711 --> 00:06:28,624
We'll fill this home with love and care.

107
00:06:28,671 --> 00:06:30,584
Our lives will be a fairy tale.

108
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:33,108
Our lives will be a fairy tale.

109
00:06:41,191 --> 00:06:42,910
What! Wha...

110
00:06:43,351 --> 00:06:44,866
Oh, now I got him.

111
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,380
What're ya doing in here?
Ya little freeloader.

112
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:51,659
I told ya before to stay out of
the chicken coop.

113
00:06:53,031 --> 00:06:54,386
What a nut job.

114
00:07:08,911 --> 00:07:10,141
Hmm? What's this?

115
00:07:10,351 --> 00:07:11,467
A jar?

116
00:07:11,751 --> 00:07:13,709
Why is it here?

117
00:07:15,751 --> 00:07:17,630
Huh, is it!

118
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:18,748
Oh, my!

119
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:20,306
This has to be a dream.

120
00:07:20,311 --> 00:07:21,110
It's gold!

121
00:07:21,111 --> 00:07:22,739
Mom! Dad! Come here!

122
00:07:22,911 --> 00:07:23,948
Look what I found!

123
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:27,022
Real jewelry and gold, gold,
gold, gold.

124
00:07:27,311 --> 00:07:28,666
Ha, what did he say he's found?

125
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,306
Come, you've got to see this.

126
00:07:31,511 --> 00:07:33,230
Hurry up it's unbelievable.

127
00:07:33,711 --> 00:07:35,510
All our problems are over.

128
00:07:35,991 --> 00:07:37,107
Alright!

129
00:07:37,191 --> 00:07:39,024
It's our Lucky day!

130
00:07:40,191 --> 00:07:42,980
I think he means my lucky day.

131
00:07:48,671 --> 00:07:53,940
Amine, look, here's a ruby and this
one's an emerald. What a treasure!

132
00:07:54,351 --> 00:07:56,184
Hamal! Hamal! Come and see!

133
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,787
Wow! Can I see one?

134
00:07:58,431 --> 00:08:01,350
I found it inside the wall as I was
knocking it down.

135
00:08:01,351 --> 00:08:02,830
Whaddya think you're doing, Enad?

136
00:08:02,831 --> 00:08:04,459
Aaaahhh!

137
00:08:05,951 --> 00:08:08,945
Shhhhh, keep your voice down.

138
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,462
Listen, look...

139
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,550
...they found an amazing treasure!

140
00:08:14,111 --> 00:08:16,510
I don't care what's going on.
It's none of your business.

141
00:08:16,511 --> 00:08:18,947
Whaddya think they're going to
do if they see you?

142
00:08:19,351 --> 00:08:21,150
Obviously you couldn't have heard me.

143
00:08:21,551 --> 00:08:23,020
They found a huge treasure!

144
00:08:25,991 --> 00:08:27,983
Now they'll have to keep a close
eye on it.

145
00:08:27,991 --> 00:08:29,619
I just can't believe our luck.

146
00:08:29,911 --> 00:08:31,027
Oh Amine, Amine.

147
00:08:31,391 --> 00:08:32,507
Now we can pay off the land,

148
00:08:32,831 --> 00:08:34,505
build a new house and renew our lives.

149
00:08:34,831 --> 00:08:37,745
Living debt free in total happiness
and contentment.

150
00:08:38,191 --> 00:08:39,990
It's the answer to all of our problems...

151
00:08:40,671 --> 00:08:44,188
We'll never have another worry again
as long as we live.

152
00:08:44,511 --> 00:08:48,347
Oh, it's a dream come true.

153
00:09:00,191 --> 00:09:02,149
What a great day this is...

154
00:09:02,711 --> 00:09:04,510
Goodbye to poverty and hunger,

155
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,988
hello new life of wealth and luxury.

156
00:09:07,191 --> 00:09:10,389
Hasan will be able to drape his wife
in rubies and emeralds.

157
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:13,023
Hasan, maybe you wanna marry
a nice girl?

158
00:09:13,351 --> 00:09:14,501
Haa? Me?

159
00:09:14,671 --> 00:09:15,870
That's a good one.

160
00:09:15,871 --> 00:09:19,343
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha...

161
00:09:19,391 --> 00:09:22,703
...and our ten kids will call me daddy,
daddy, daddy.

162
00:09:23,351 --> 00:09:26,030
They'll all wanna play something
different at the same time...

163
00:09:26,031 --> 00:09:27,830
...and then I'll call you to come
and babysit.

164
00:09:27,831 --> 00:09:28,950
And as for me,

165
00:09:28,951 --> 00:09:30,830
I'd like to have my very own zoo.

166
00:09:30,831 --> 00:09:35,509
With all kinds of animals like elephants
and tigers and zebras,

167
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:38,227
and my zoo would also have birds
like a peacock.

168
00:09:40,191 --> 00:09:42,024
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

169
00:09:44,991 --> 00:09:46,187
Enough!

170
00:09:46,871 --> 00:09:47,828
That's enough.

171
00:09:48,511 --> 00:09:50,185
Enough dreaming and planning.

172
00:09:51,911 --> 00:09:53,266
This money isn't even ours.

173
00:09:53,911 --> 00:09:55,187
It belongs to Al

174
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:06,102
Now, Al sold us this place...

175
00:10:06,271 --> 00:10:07,706
...not his belongings.

176
00:10:07,711 --> 00:10:09,783
Haaaa...

177
00:10:09,991 --> 00:10:13,622
Mmm, uh, but dad.

178
00:10:14,471 --> 00:10:16,150
I found it inside a wall.

179
00:10:16,151 --> 00:10:19,429
If I hadn't used my own two hands
to dig it out...

180
00:10:19,431 --> 00:10:24,586
...the jar would still be there.
I don't understand. Uhhh,

181
00:10:25,031 --> 00:10:26,950
It's a once in a lifetime chance.

182
00:10:26,951 --> 00:10:29,110
You're not gonna throw this
opportunity away?

183
00:10:29,111 --> 00:10:30,261
Throw away?

184
00:10:30,711 --> 00:10:32,021
Something that isn't mine?

185
00:10:33,031 --> 00:10:35,308
The treasure obviously belongs to someone,

186
00:10:35,311 --> 00:10:37,144
but it certainly doesn't belong to us.

187
00:10:37,191 --> 00:10:38,706
Well, just, just a minute, Amine.

188
00:10:38,911 --> 00:10:42,144
We own the house and it includes the land,
ceiling and walls.

189
00:10:42,831 --> 00:10:45,187
The jar was inside a wall that we own.

190
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,907
I think it is ours.

191
00:10:47,831 --> 00:10:49,190
Please think about this carefully.

192
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:50,706
Why should I think about it?

193
00:10:51,471 --> 00:10:54,385
There's no need to think when I know
the right answer already.

194
00:10:54,871 --> 00:10:57,501
The jar is Al's... and only Al's.

195
00:10:57,911 --> 00:10:59,266
We'll return it to him right away.

196
00:10:59,471 --> 00:11:02,431
Ya, but wouldn't he take it with him?

197
00:11:02,631 --> 00:11:04,430
How could he forget a treasure like this.

198
00:11:04,871 --> 00:11:07,182
Insane, the man's insane.

199
00:11:07,951 --> 00:11:09,227
Hasan's right.

200
00:11:09,391 --> 00:11:11,383
Now just listen for a second, okay?

201
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:13,704
What if we discovered oil on our land...

202
00:11:13,871 --> 00:11:15,021
...would it, would it belong to Al?

203
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,221
Well...

204
00:11:18,431 --> 00:11:19,980
...the situation's totally different.

205
00:11:20,751 --> 00:11:22,140
One's a natural resource...

206
00:11:22,471 --> 00:11:24,384
...and the other was placed there by someone.

207
00:11:24,471 --> 00:11:25,940
But what about all of our debts.

208
00:11:26,071 --> 00:11:28,430
I'm gonna have to start selling
my keepsakes soon.

209
00:11:28,431 --> 00:11:29,470
This money will really help.

210
00:11:29,471 --> 00:11:31,463
Our situation has nothing to do with it.

211
00:11:32,911 --> 00:11:34,824
We should do what's right.

212
00:11:35,311 --> 00:11:37,230
Besides, found money is not the same...

213
00:11:37,231 --> 00:11:38,859
...as money you've worked for.

214
00:11:39,511 --> 00:11:41,469
Everything we have should be earned.

215
00:11:42,431 --> 00:11:45,345
Hasan, put the gold back into the jar
right now, please.

216
00:11:45,511 --> 00:11:48,106
But, dad, all of our dreams...

217
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:54,987
what if we gave half the jar to Al
and took the other half for ourselves?

218
00:11:55,431 --> 00:11:56,900
But it's all his...

219
00:11:57,791 --> 00:12:01,024
...and you want us to give him just
half of his own money?

220
00:12:01,871 --> 00:12:02,828
No no.

221
00:12:02,871 --> 00:12:05,580
I wouldn't feel right about asking
him to do that.

222
00:12:05,911 --> 00:12:08,506
Well then, let's go give the treasure
back to Al.

223
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,981
Now?!

224
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,950
Hmmm, no!

225
00:12:11,951 --> 00:12:14,467
There's no time like the present, Hasan.

226
00:12:14,871 --> 00:12:16,909
But mommy, what about my zoo...

227
00:12:17,191 --> 00:12:18,580
...and all of the birds and animals?

228
00:12:19,191 --> 00:12:20,546
Just a minute.

229
00:12:21,551 --> 00:12:23,100
Uh maybe we should wait till tomorrow.

230
00:12:23,191 --> 00:12:24,103
You never know.

231
00:12:24,231 --> 00:12:25,666
Maybe we'll find something else.

232
00:12:26,071 --> 00:12:27,190
It's possible okay,

233
00:12:27,191 --> 00:12:30,264
finish your work on the wall...

234
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:32,864
...and we'll take it back to Al first
thing in the morning.

235
00:12:34,111 --> 00:12:36,270
What a numskull!

236
00:12:36,271 --> 00:12:37,710
I can't believe it! I can't believe it!

237
00:12:37,711 --> 00:12:42,024
I can't believe he's gonna give all
that amazing treasure to Al!

238
00:12:42,631 --> 00:12:44,623
He doesn't even know if it's his!

239
00:12:45,151 --> 00:12:48,145
He's totally a crazy man,
he's gone loopy loopy loopy.

240
00:12:48,551 --> 00:12:52,705
But that's okay for me,
because it'll all soon be mine, all mine.

241
00:13:11,831 --> 00:13:15,029
<i>Gold, jewels,</i>

242
00:13:16,111 --> 00:13:18,741
<i>it's all giving me
a terrible headache.</i>

243
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:36,709
<i>The moon, the moon and the stars
used to amaze me as a kid.</i>

244
00:13:37,871 --> 00:13:42,105
<i>I thought they were jewels
of the sky.</i>

245
00:13:43,471 --> 00:13:45,782
<i>They were there
for everyone's enjoyment.</i>

246
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:46,987
<i>But these,</i>

247
00:13:47,111 --> 00:13:48,705
<i>they belong to someone.</i>

248
00:13:49,111 --> 00:13:50,864
<i>I suppose that jar
could've been burried...</i>

249
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:53,227
<i>...there hundreds of years ago...</i>

250
00:13:53,951 --> 00:13:55,181
<i>Is that possible?</i>

251
00:13:55,591 --> 00:13:56,867
<i>Sure it's possible.</i>

252
00:13:58,271 --> 00:14:01,390
<i>In that case it belongs to
whoever finds it.</i>

253
00:14:02,271 --> 00:14:03,786
Which means it's ours!

254
00:14:04,431 --> 00:14:06,150
The treasure belongs to me!

255
00:14:06,551 --> 00:14:09,146
The fools can debate about right
or wrong all they want.

256
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:13,542
Amine is a fool, he just doesn't get it.

257
00:14:13,631 --> 00:14:15,828
He has the jar, and he wants to forget it.

258
00:14:15,831 --> 00:14:18,028
Well I have a plan, It'll work just fine.

259
00:14:18,231 --> 00:14:19,268
I'm gonna steal the jar,

260
00:14:19,311 --> 00:14:20,461
and make it mine.

261
00:14:20,631 --> 00:14:21,668
I'm gonna steal the jar,

262
00:14:23,151 --> 00:14:24,347
cause I have a plan.

263
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:26,666
I'm gonna steal the jar,

264
00:14:27,311 --> 00:14:29,110
from that silly old man.

265
00:14:29,951 --> 00:14:31,101
I'm gonna steal the jar,

266
00:14:31,391 --> 00:14:32,428
that's what I'm gonna do.

267
00:14:34,191 --> 00:14:38,425
Today better be quiet.

268
00:14:40,231 --> 00:14:42,906
How will I fool them? Yes. Mmmm, mum.

269
00:14:50,391 --> 00:14:51,985
I need a smart idea,

270
00:14:52,711 --> 00:14:54,624
but what!

271
00:14:55,111 --> 00:14:56,227
<i>No,</i>

272
00:14:56,471 --> 00:14:59,790
<i>I won't allow myself to think that
it's ours yet.</i>

273
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:02,430
<i>If we found it in a deserted valley...</i>

274
00:15:02,431 --> 00:15:04,750
<i>...or in an empty well in the desert,</i>

275
00:15:04,751 --> 00:15:06,790
<i>or at the top of a mighty mountain,</i>

276
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:08,270
<i>would it be ours then?</i>

277
00:15:08,271 --> 00:15:11,060
<i>Someone still had to put it there.</i>

278
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:15,149
No! It can't be ours.

279
00:15:15,551 --> 00:15:19,068
I have to return it to the rightful
owner and that's final.

280
00:15:27,631 --> 00:15:30,625
I wish I knew where this gold came from.

281
00:15:30,831 --> 00:15:33,347
How something so beautiful on one hand...

282
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:35,830
...could cause such ugliness on the other.

283
00:15:35,831 --> 00:15:36,630
<i>But just a minute, Amine.</i>

284
00:15:36,631 --> 00:15:38,910
<i>We own the house
and it includes the land,</i>

285
00:15:38,911 --> 00:15:39,990
<i>ceiling and walls.</i>

286
00:15:39,991 --> 00:15:42,302
<i>The jar was inside a wall that we own.</i>

287
00:15:43,231 --> 00:15:44,302
<i>I think it is ours.</i>

288
00:15:44,631 --> 00:15:45,827
<i>Please think about
this carefully, okay?</i>

289
00:15:46,911 --> 00:15:53,500
Ohhhh! There's gotta be a solution
to this. A right one.

290
00:15:54,311 --> 00:15:56,383
The first step is to take the jar to Al.

291
00:15:57,111 --> 00:15:58,580
I wonder, I wonder.

292
00:15:59,311 --> 00:16:02,509
How am I gonna get that blasted jar
away from them?

293
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:06,865
I can just imagine how it would feel to run
some luxurious pearls through my fingers.

294
00:16:08,351 --> 00:16:10,150
Oh, and gold pieces too.

295
00:16:10,151 --> 00:16:10,950
Awwww!

296
00:16:10,951 --> 00:16:12,386
Waaaa!

297
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:14,067
Oh, it's just you.

298
00:16:14,751 --> 00:16:15,981
Your hands are cold.

299
00:16:18,471 --> 00:16:20,270
What were you talking about, ha?

300
00:16:20,831 --> 00:16:22,664
Nothing. Not a thing.

301
00:16:23,471 --> 00:16:27,466
Sleep. I was just thinking how beautiful
you are when you're asleep.

302
00:16:28,471 --> 00:16:31,146
I look at you and I think of jewels.

303
00:16:32,231 --> 00:16:34,269
I could stare at you all day.

304
00:16:34,311 --> 00:16:35,830
Did I hear right?

305
00:16:35,831 --> 00:16:38,665
Could all this sweet talk be coming
from you?

306
00:16:40,151 --> 00:16:43,827
<i>I was having a sweet and beautiful
dream about food.</i>

307
00:16:45,231 --> 00:16:46,950
<i>I was drinking some lemonade.</i>

308
00:16:47,231 --> 00:16:51,704
<i>Then I was swimming in it...
swimming like a fish.</i>

309
00:16:52,431 --> 00:16:55,220
<i>Then I ate dessert
that was bigger than me...</i>

310
00:16:55,391 --> 00:16:57,747
<i>...and I plunged right
into the middle of it.</i>

311
00:17:01,191 --> 00:17:03,229
<i>Then I became a magician on stage.</i>

312
00:17:03,391 --> 00:17:04,910
<i>I don't think
I was very good though...</i>

313
00:17:04,911 --> 00:17:06,426
<i>...because I got my words mixed up...</i>

314
00:17:06,991 --> 00:17:08,790
<i>...and said mule instead of stool.</i>

315
00:17:13,391 --> 00:17:16,863
<i>Then I said rocking horse when
I wanted to say talking horse.</i>

316
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:21,069
<i>Then I fell flat on my face.</i>

317
00:17:23,871 --> 00:17:26,182
Somehow that doesn't surprise me.

318
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:29,505
Memm. Even in your dreams, you're crazy.

319
00:17:46,151 --> 00:17:49,429
C'mon. Hurry.

320
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:54,226
Stay down.

321
00:18:00,631 --> 00:18:04,819
Now here's the plan, see.
Okay, pay attention.

322
00:18:08,111 --> 00:18:10,310
You get it, it's a good plan, see.
It's gonna work.

323
00:18:10,311 --> 00:18:12,588
Sure, yeah right.

324
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:16,270
Now we meet here, see...
I can just taste those suckers now.

325
00:18:16,271 --> 00:18:17,350
Give me that thing.

326
00:18:17,351 --> 00:18:19,104
Now here's what I think.

327
00:18:19,151 --> 00:18:20,870
See, what do you think of that.

328
00:18:20,871 --> 00:18:22,863
Why you useless embasil.

329
00:18:23,471 --> 00:18:25,270
Gimme that stick.

330
00:18:26,671 --> 00:18:28,584
Now, stop your whining
and hold out your hand.

331
00:19:11,871 --> 00:19:14,705
Okay, you ready?
Here it comes.

332
00:19:15,711 --> 00:19:18,110
You see me? You there?
I'm dropping it.

333
00:19:18,111 --> 00:19:19,390
Catch it.

334
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:21,224
Yeah, lemme have it.

335
00:19:21,871 --> 00:19:23,101
Yep, bring it down.

336
00:19:23,311 --> 00:19:24,905
Yeup, yep, yep give it to me.

337
00:19:29,591 --> 00:19:31,588
Uha ho... now that's
just great you simpleton.

338
00:19:31,589 --> 00:19:33,586
Now I have to risk my
life to get another one.

339
00:19:33,991 --> 00:19:35,380
Can't you do anything right?

340
00:19:40,231 --> 00:19:43,862
Oh sure, everything is a game or a joke
to you, while I'm doing all the work.

341
00:20:05,391 --> 00:20:06,906
Aaaahhh!

342
00:20:07,391 --> 00:20:08,701
How're you doing?

343
00:20:10,991 --> 00:20:12,267
Waaahhh!

344
00:20:20,311 --> 00:20:21,621
Yaaahhh!

345
00:20:29,191 --> 00:20:31,866
Oh, rats and frats it would've been
easier to do it myself.

346
00:20:46,831 --> 00:20:47,550
Some cookies.

347
00:20:47,551 --> 00:20:48,781
Oh thanks a lot, Hun.

348
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:50,186
We shouldn't be too late tonight.

349
00:20:50,471 --> 00:20:54,147
We're just going to Al's place and
hopefully we'll be back before sunset.

350
00:20:55,471 --> 00:20:57,310
Oh, I wish I could go with you today.

351
00:20:57,311 --> 00:20:58,939
oh, well, maybe next time.

352
00:20:59,311 --> 00:21:01,349
Say "hi" to Al's daughter, Samantha.

353
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:04,670
She's such a nice girl and
she's Hasan's age.

354
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:06,707
Hmmm, you're right.

355
00:21:09,031 --> 00:21:10,830
Looks like our wagon needs some repair.

356
00:21:11,191 --> 00:21:14,230
We're going right by the village market,
dear on the way back...

357
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:15,347
...do you need anything from there?

358
00:21:16,631 --> 00:21:17,827
Hmmm, oh now I remember.

359
00:21:17,911 --> 00:21:19,630
We need some eggs.

360
00:21:19,831 --> 00:21:23,223
There weren't enough in the chicken coop
this morning for some reason.

361
00:21:23,431 --> 00:21:25,105
Hmmm, that's strange.

362
00:21:25,671 --> 00:21:26,790
I thought so.

363
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:28,988
Oh well, is there anything else you need?

364
00:21:29,711 --> 00:21:31,829
I don't think so. Have a nice trip.

365
00:21:32,191 --> 00:21:33,270
Thanks. Okay.

366
00:21:33,271 --> 00:21:34,501
Bye mom.

367
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:36,180
Hasan, let's ride.

368
00:21:38,191 --> 00:21:39,182
Be careful!

369
00:21:39,271 --> 00:21:41,309
Haaa, let's go!

370
00:21:42,671 --> 00:21:45,062
Daddy! Daddy!

371
00:21:46,151 --> 00:21:48,269
Can I come with you?

372
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:51,863
Ah, of course you can, son.
Hop in the back.

373
00:22:06,111 --> 00:22:09,230
Doo dee doo doo doo. Hmmm?
Where are they?

374
00:22:09,311 --> 00:22:10,268
Where'd they go?

375
00:22:11,151 --> 00:22:12,110
They're on their way.

376
00:22:12,111 --> 00:22:13,546
We have to follow them closely...

377
00:22:13,551 --> 00:22:15,225
...so don't let them out of our sight.

378
00:22:17,591 --> 00:22:18,741
Then we will take the jar.

379
00:22:19,311 --> 00:22:21,224
Hurry, hurry, c'mon, let's go!
Chop chop chop...

380
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:30,146
Waahoo!

381
00:22:40,191 --> 00:22:45,301
Let's see where they are. Mmmm,
we'd better hurry.

382
00:23:11,031 --> 00:23:15,550
There they are. Oh, no, they're almost
there. I need an idea right now.

383
00:23:15,551 --> 00:23:18,067
You're supposed to be helpful.
Don't you have any ideas?

384
00:23:19,551 --> 00:23:20,940
Oh, rain!

385
00:23:21,031 --> 00:23:22,310
Looks like it could be a storm.

386
00:23:22,311 --> 00:23:23,860
Oh Oh.

387
00:23:23,991 --> 00:23:26,951
we'd better get going quickly
before it starts to really pour.

388
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:31,710
Be careful now. I hear something.

389
00:23:34,711 --> 00:23:35,748
Waaaooo!

390
00:23:36,311 --> 00:23:39,305
Hey! Easy! Calm down! Hey, Ahhh!

391
00:23:39,311 --> 00:23:40,510
Be careful Hasan.

392
00:23:40,511 --> 00:23:41,821
Hold on tight.

393
00:23:41,991 --> 00:23:44,109
He's totally out of control.

394
00:23:44,711 --> 00:23:45,987
I can't hold him.

395
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:47,710
Help me dad, help me.

396
00:23:47,711 --> 00:23:49,430
Don't worry, son! Give me the rein!

397
00:23:49,431 --> 00:23:52,061
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! What's going on?
I'm gonna fall.

398
00:23:53,751 --> 00:23:55,789
Hold on tight, Hamal!

399
00:23:55,951 --> 00:23:57,579
Heeeelp!

400
00:24:00,671 --> 00:24:01,503
Waha ha ha ha ha!

401
00:24:01,871 --> 00:24:05,581
Bingo! Aha ha ha ha!
It's in the water!

402
00:24:05,831 --> 00:24:07,186
Let's go get it.
It's our only chance.

403
00:24:08,231 --> 00:24:09,984
Help me!

404
00:24:10,151 --> 00:24:12,310
Be brave, Hamal! Give me your hand.

405
00:24:12,311 --> 00:24:13,150
Daddy! Daddy! Ahhh!

406
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:15,940
I can't hold on any longer.

407
00:24:18,311 --> 00:24:19,939
Reach further! A little more!

408
00:24:20,631 --> 00:24:24,350
Help me, help me.

409
00:24:24,351 --> 00:24:25,263
Be brave! Hasan is coming.

410
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:26,463
Hurry Hasan!

411
00:24:26,951 --> 00:24:28,340
I'm comming, I'm coming.

412
00:24:30,151 --> 00:24:31,506
Hasan hurry...

413
00:24:31,831 --> 00:24:33,110
I'm just about there.

414
00:24:33,111 --> 00:24:34,023
Oh no!

415
00:24:34,111 --> 00:24:35,190
Give me your hand.

416
00:24:35,191 --> 00:24:35,943
Aaaaahhhh!

417
00:24:37,111 --> 00:24:38,500
Hamal!

418
00:24:43,431 --> 00:24:44,581
Daddy.

419
00:24:45,271 --> 00:24:47,389
Wu... help.

420
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:50,699
Help!

421
00:24:52,071 --> 00:24:52,869
Help!

422
00:24:54,191 --> 00:24:55,182
Help!

423
00:24:57,551 --> 00:24:58,508
Help!

424
00:25:04,351 --> 00:25:06,503
Uhha ha, hurry Cleo, hurry!

425
00:25:06,551 --> 00:25:07,701
Quit stalling and get it in gear!

426
00:25:08,991 --> 00:25:09,982
Look, it's right there.

427
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:17,390
If you could just go a little faster.
Huagh! Come back Cleo, come back!

428
00:25:38,231 --> 00:25:39,620
Grab onto the rope!

429
00:25:43,111 --> 00:25:45,229
You see Cleo, ha ha ha ha!

430
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:49,189
This is an example of the superior human
brain at work. Ahhh! Ouuff!

431
00:25:50,871 --> 00:25:52,704
What an idiot.

432
00:25:53,271 --> 00:25:54,786
There it goes.

433
00:26:04,591 --> 00:26:05,707
Hold on, Cleo!

434
00:26:05,991 --> 00:26:08,461
Don't let go! Hold on tight!

435
00:26:08,951 --> 00:26:11,103
I see it, I see it. It's coming closer.

436
00:26:11,471 --> 00:26:12,860
Don't let go!

437
00:26:13,351 --> 00:26:15,582
Here it comes.

438
00:26:15,871 --> 00:26:17,270
Hold on! Hold on!

439
00:26:17,271 --> 00:26:18,467
Aaahhh! Gotcha Ya!

440
00:26:19,191 --> 00:26:22,424
Aah, you're all mine, blrrr...

441
00:26:22,591 --> 00:26:23,550
Pull! Blrrrr...

442
00:26:23,551 --> 00:26:24,463
Blublublublsblub.

443
00:26:27,391 --> 00:26:29,019
Pull me up! Blrrr...

444
00:26:36,231 --> 00:26:39,748
Daaha ha! Aha ha ha ha ha...

445
00:26:59,711 --> 00:27:01,624
Oh, dad, I think he's gonna be alright.

446
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:02,902
Ah, yes.

447
00:27:06,871 --> 00:27:08,070
Where am I?

448
00:27:08,071 --> 00:27:09,381
You're safe, son.

449
00:27:09,671 --> 00:27:11,902
Everything's gonna be alright now.

450
00:27:12,671 --> 00:27:15,869
Daddy, I was really scared.

451
00:27:17,271 --> 00:27:20,981
You're safe now, son, don't worry.
No need to be afraid.

452
00:27:27,351 --> 00:27:30,185
Ahh, yes, my strong son the brave hero.

453
00:27:34,671 --> 00:27:37,426
We've ended up a long way
from the wagon, dad.

454
00:27:38,631 --> 00:27:40,350
Huh! The jar! The jar!

455
00:27:41,551 --> 00:27:43,623
Aha ha ha ha haaa...

456
00:27:44,951 --> 00:27:46,261
I can't believe it.

457
00:27:47,111 --> 00:27:48,466
How could they forget it?

458
00:27:48,631 --> 00:27:49,941
Well, it's in good hands now.

459
00:27:50,351 --> 00:27:53,424
I'll take some with me and
leave the rest hidden in here.

460
00:27:56,111 --> 00:27:57,739
Ya see, good things come
to those who wait.

461
00:28:00,591 --> 00:28:02,709
Now, I shall take my leave knowing
you're safe here.

462
00:28:02,791 --> 00:28:04,419
I'm on top of the world!

463
00:28:05,991 --> 00:28:10,070
I am the richest man in the world!

464
00:28:10,071 --> 00:28:13,349
Aha ha ha ha ha, Aha ha ha ha ha!

465
00:28:14,711 --> 00:28:20,026
Huh, wah, wah... Uh, uh, uh.
Who's there?

466
00:28:21,391 --> 00:28:24,863
Waaahhh! Aaaahhh!

467
00:28:50,151 --> 00:28:51,506
No! No!

468
00:28:55,071 --> 00:28:56,540
You musn't show yourselves yet.

469
00:28:56,871 --> 00:28:59,341
Come back here.
Where are you?

470
00:29:09,311 --> 00:29:11,827
Enad, what are you doing here?

471
00:29:11,831 --> 00:29:17,310
Nothing. Hee, hee, hee nothing at all.
Haa, haa, haa you look lovely.

472
00:29:17,311 --> 00:29:19,906
Poor Cleo bumped her head.
You could give her something for it.

473
00:29:20,751 --> 00:29:22,948
What's under your hand, Enad?

474
00:29:25,591 --> 00:29:27,106
Eh, did you feed the food and cook
the donkey?

475
00:29:27,511 --> 00:29:29,708
What? What are you hiding?

476
00:29:32,791 --> 00:29:34,226
Let go of my hand.

477
00:29:34,511 --> 00:29:35,910
How would you like to go
on a shopping spree?

478
00:29:35,911 --> 00:29:36,902
Um, uh, in the village.

479
00:29:37,191 --> 00:29:39,024
And ahh, you can buy whatever you like.

480
00:29:41,471 --> 00:29:42,508
A jewel?

481
00:29:42,711 --> 00:29:44,226
Where did you get it from?

482
00:29:44,351 --> 00:29:46,104
What difference does it make where
I got it from?

483
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:49,150
The point is it'll transform our
dreary life into a happy one.

484
00:29:49,151 --> 00:29:52,065
Stop it! Whaddaya mean a happy life?

485
00:29:52,071 --> 00:29:52,870
You're old enough to know...

486
00:29:52,871 --> 00:29:55,148
...that happiness doesn't come
from dirty money...

487
00:29:55,191 --> 00:29:56,660
...but from honest hard work.

488
00:29:57,471 --> 00:30:00,544
Honest work. Ya right, that's a good one.

489
00:30:01,151 --> 00:30:02,470
It's all a bunch of hooey.

490
00:30:02,471 --> 00:30:04,270
This hut is what honest work'll getcha.

491
00:30:04,431 --> 00:30:07,061
It can buy us one, two,
three, ten castles.

492
00:30:07,551 --> 00:30:09,862
Money money just one...

493
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:14,140
Money money money... we'll buy the
finest hats, perfumes,

494
00:30:14,231 --> 00:30:17,623
silk clothing and we'll dine on gourmet
meals prepared by the best chefs.

495
00:30:17,711 --> 00:30:20,944
We'll have a hundred servants.
This money will keep us warm and rich.

496
00:30:21,631 --> 00:30:24,910
This stolen money's going to burn us,
and I don't want any part of it.

497
00:30:24,911 --> 00:30:26,187
You can keep it!

498
00:30:57,071 --> 00:31:02,909
Eye of Heaven, I'm downhearted...

499
00:31:03,351 --> 00:31:07,346
...and confused and sad.

500
00:31:09,231 --> 00:31:10,630
I've lost the jar.

501
00:31:10,631 --> 00:31:12,544
I'm full of sorrow.

502
00:31:14,151 --> 00:31:20,342
Please help me my Lord.

503
00:31:21,511 --> 00:31:32,628
Be my guidance oh my Lord.
Lord of Heavens save my soul.

504
00:31:33,631 --> 00:31:38,741
Holy Promise The Holy Promise.

505
00:31:39,391 --> 00:31:44,990
Proves the virtue of the man.

506
00:31:45,471 --> 00:31:51,025
Gives him strength,
the strength to stand.

507
00:31:57,871 --> 00:32:00,227
Despite the setting sun...

508
00:32:01,271 --> 00:32:03,901
...I keep on searching.

509
00:32:04,991 --> 00:32:08,861
I ask myself if it's all worth while.

510
00:32:09,471 --> 00:32:12,988
But I know the answer will come to me.

511
00:32:13,671 --> 00:32:17,541
For my life is based on honesty.

512
00:32:18,231 --> 00:32:23,830
Holy Promise The Holy Promise.

513
00:32:24,231 --> 00:32:29,830
Proves the virtue of the man.

514
00:32:30,511 --> 00:32:35,701
Gives him strength,
the strength to stand.

515
00:32:38,111 --> 00:32:40,467
<i>No, no more despair.</i>

516
00:32:41,511 --> 00:32:44,709
<i>This lost treasure
overwhelmed my soul.</i>

517
00:32:54,311 --> 00:32:57,225
Everyday I go on searching.

518
00:32:57,271 --> 00:33:00,185
By the valleys and the streams.

519
00:33:00,191 --> 00:33:03,190
I do my best to serve my neighbor.

520
00:33:03,191 --> 00:33:05,980
I do my best to please my God.

521
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:08,781
Everyday I go on searching.

522
00:33:09,151 --> 00:33:12,065
By the valleys and the streams.

523
00:33:12,151 --> 00:33:15,190
I do my best to serve my neighbor.

524
00:33:15,271 --> 00:33:18,185
I do my best to please my God.

525
00:33:18,471 --> 00:33:20,941
Everyday I go on searching.

526
00:33:21,071 --> 00:33:23,746
By the valleys and the streams.

527
00:33:24,071 --> 00:33:27,070
I do my best to serve my neighbor.

528
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:30,065
I do my best to please my God.

529
00:33:30,551 --> 00:33:35,820
Holy Promise The Holy Promise.

530
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:41,746
Proves the virtue of the man.

531
00:33:42,431 --> 00:33:47,905
Gives him strength, the strength to stand.

532
00:33:48,791 --> 00:33:53,981
Gives him strength, the strength to stand.

533
00:33:54,631 --> 00:34:01,300
Gives him strength,
the strength to staaaand...

534
00:34:19,591 --> 00:34:21,190
Ehhh, you've caught enough
for dinner, Hasan!

535
00:34:21,191 --> 00:34:22,390
Come and help me look now.

536
00:34:22,391 --> 00:34:24,190
Dad, we've been looking for a week.

537
00:34:24,191 --> 00:34:25,030
I know.

538
00:34:25,031 --> 00:34:26,261
Isn't that enough?

539
00:34:26,511 --> 00:34:29,230
I really don't think
we're gonna find it, dad. O.K.

540
00:34:29,231 --> 00:34:30,430
Oh, c'mon?

541
00:34:30,431 --> 00:34:32,867
This isn't just an old shoe
we're looking for.

542
00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:35,060
Daaahhh!

543
00:34:36,791 --> 00:34:38,180
Greetings my good neighbours.

544
00:34:38,391 --> 00:34:40,588
Hurgggh. Oh, Right in the eye!

545
00:34:40,831 --> 00:34:43,426
Oh, I'm sorry, Enad.
I didn't see you there.

546
00:34:43,471 --> 00:34:45,065
It's just an eye.

547
00:34:45,231 --> 00:34:46,670
Tell me my good man.

548
00:34:46,671 --> 00:34:51,383
How are things going?
The family good?

549
00:34:52,951 --> 00:34:56,184
So how goes the fishing today?

550
00:34:57,151 --> 00:34:58,984
How about giving some to me?

551
00:35:00,831 --> 00:35:02,350
I prefer it fried.

552
00:35:02,351 --> 00:35:03,820
Aaaaeeeeaaaa!

553
00:35:04,831 --> 00:35:06,150
If ya wanna sell'em,

554
00:35:06,151 --> 00:35:08,542
there's a guy in the village
named Jimmy Scales,

555
00:35:08,711 --> 00:35:10,783
he's good and he'll give ya a fair price.

556
00:35:11,351 --> 00:35:14,430
Just mention my name,
and he'll treat ya fine.

557
00:35:14,431 --> 00:35:15,150
Thanks...

558
00:35:15,151 --> 00:35:17,587
...but we're really busy looking for
something we lost here.

559
00:35:17,831 --> 00:35:20,430
I certainly haven't seen it whatever it is...

560
00:35:20,431 --> 00:35:22,867
...and I most certainly wouldn't
keep it for myself.

561
00:35:23,311 --> 00:35:26,669
That wouldn't be nice.
Ah, let's check with the cards...

562
00:35:26,711 --> 00:35:30,421
...and see what they say,
they always tell the truth.

563
00:35:31,271 --> 00:35:32,630
Ah, here's the ace of diamonds...

564
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:34,390
...which means you've lost
something valuable.

565
00:35:34,391 --> 00:35:36,463
Will you find it or not?

566
00:35:36,791 --> 00:35:38,419
Oh, oh, the cards are saying:

567
00:35:38,471 --> 00:35:40,589
"what has been lost will never be found"

568
00:35:40,591 --> 00:35:41,590
Gosh, thanks Enad.

569
00:35:41,591 --> 00:35:44,505
But I think we'll find what we
lost with hard work,

570
00:35:45,071 --> 00:35:47,427
not by listening to ugly losing cards.

571
00:35:49,111 --> 00:35:51,024
My cards never fail.

572
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:54,708
I know this for sure.
Uhhh, you'll see they're right.

573
00:35:55,751 --> 00:35:58,665
Let's go, Cleo.
They're up the creek.

574
00:35:59,271 --> 00:36:01,946
Good luck finding it.
Have a nice day.

575
00:36:02,151 --> 00:36:05,270
Alright, Cleo, it's time
to go to my happy place.

576
00:36:05,751 --> 00:36:07,186
La, la, la, la, la...

577
00:36:09,031 --> 00:36:11,467
What a strange and annoying little man.

578
00:36:11,551 --> 00:36:13,384
He really makes my skin crawl.

579
00:36:25,231 --> 00:36:26,620
Ooh, I'd better watch my back.

580
00:36:26,911 --> 00:36:29,347
I don't want anyone seeing me
going into this cave.

581
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:35,140
Hmm, I smell a rat.

582
00:36:40,111 --> 00:36:42,547
Oh boy, this looks great.
I'm starving!

583
00:36:43,151 --> 00:36:44,310
Here's Hasan's fish!

584
00:36:44,311 --> 00:36:45,070
I'm quite hungry too.

585
00:36:45,071 --> 00:36:45,983
All right!

586
00:36:47,031 --> 00:36:50,741
Ha, ha, ha aw all right, wooohooo.

587
00:36:59,791 --> 00:37:03,630
Blahh! Mom, please don't feed me
hot peppers anymore. I can't eat them.

588
00:37:03,631 --> 00:37:06,465
Awe, c'mon. You're a big boy. You should
be able to eat a couple of peppers.

589
00:37:07,671 --> 00:37:08,790
Mmm, I love hot peppers.

590
00:37:08,791 --> 00:37:11,307
Well, if you like 'em so much,
try this, ha ha ha ha.

591
00:37:14,871 --> 00:37:17,182
Ahh, all this good food's making me tired.

592
00:37:22,551 --> 00:37:23,986
I know you're still worried,

593
00:37:24,311 --> 00:37:25,826
but if you don't find the jar...

594
00:37:26,031 --> 00:37:27,750
...then it just wasn't meant to be.

595
00:37:28,551 --> 00:37:31,710
Haah, I wish I could swim like a fish
then I could've followed the jar.

596
00:37:31,711 --> 00:37:33,544
Here ya go, Nutty,
I'm all finished with it.

597
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:37,621
Waahoo! All right, dinner
for one coming up.

598
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,822
Aaah! What!

599
00:38:12,511 --> 00:38:16,301
Hey aren't you supposed to be
up a tree somewhere?

600
00:38:16,511 --> 00:38:18,867
You could get into a lot of trouble
down here.

601
00:38:21,631 --> 00:38:24,022
I sure told that big squirrel off.

602
00:38:24,791 --> 00:38:28,228
Yikes! Big? Squirrel?

603
00:38:32,831 --> 00:38:34,346
What's the big idea?

604
00:38:34,551 --> 00:38:36,179
Stop pushing me around you moron.

605
00:38:36,191 --> 00:38:38,866
I said stop pushing me around if you know
what's good for ya, see.

606
00:38:40,631 --> 00:38:41,941
Aahh!

607
00:38:45,991 --> 00:38:48,825
Now, how many times have I told you
to stay away from this chicken coop?

608
00:38:49,431 --> 00:38:54,109
Aww, he doesn't know anything.

609
00:38:59,591 --> 00:39:01,185
Aaaahhh!

610
00:39:05,911 --> 00:39:07,230
Now lets get the other one, quick.

611
00:39:07,231 --> 00:39:09,223
Okay.

612
00:39:11,751 --> 00:39:13,106
Bye bye.

613
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:14,701
Aaaahhh!

614
00:39:19,751 --> 00:39:21,300
Aaaahhh!

615
00:39:26,191 --> 00:39:28,830
Nutty! Nutty!

616
00:39:28,831 --> 00:39:30,584
Come on, let's get outta here.

617
00:39:31,471 --> 00:39:33,463
Nutty!

618
00:39:34,511 --> 00:39:36,230
Are you trying to tell me it wasn't you?

619
00:39:39,591 --> 00:39:42,186
Give it to me now you've done
enough for one night.

620
00:39:44,271 --> 00:39:47,583
I gotta prove it wasn't me, but how?

621
00:40:07,511 --> 00:40:10,664
Hah, that must be the hard work
you love so much.

622
00:40:25,791 --> 00:40:28,190
My name is Enad,
I'm a real cool dude.

623
00:40:28,191 --> 00:40:30,390
Some say I'm mean,
some say I'm rude.

624
00:40:30,391 --> 00:40:32,670
Yes, I'm Enad and I have the jar.

625
00:40:32,671 --> 00:40:35,062
I've found all the riches and
I'm gonna go far.

626
00:40:35,151 --> 00:40:37,270
I found the jar filled with jewels.

627
00:40:37,271 --> 00:40:39,423
The man who lost it is a silly fool.

628
00:40:39,471 --> 00:40:41,827
He'll never know who took the stash.

629
00:40:41,951 --> 00:40:44,103
I'm gonna sell it all and get some cash.

630
00:40:44,231 --> 00:40:46,508
Yeah, that's exactly what I'm gonna do.

631
00:40:46,511 --> 00:40:48,469
I am Enad I'm a real cool dude.

632
00:40:48,911 --> 00:40:50,910
Some say I'm mean,
some say I'm rude.

633
00:40:50,911 --> 00:40:53,063
Yes, I am Enad
and I have the jar.

634
00:40:53,231 --> 00:40:55,508
I've got all the riches
and I'm gonna go far.

635
00:40:55,511 --> 00:40:57,708
I tricked the family who lives next door.

636
00:40:57,991 --> 00:41:00,109
Now I'm rich and they're still poor.

637
00:41:00,311 --> 00:41:02,303
They might suspect me
but they'll never know.

638
00:41:02,391 --> 00:41:04,702
It's a perfect crime,
this jar that I stole.

639
00:41:05,231 --> 00:41:07,508
Have you ever seen such a clever guy.

640
00:41:07,911 --> 00:41:09,270
No.

641
00:41:09,271 --> 00:41:11,550
I am Enad a real cool dude.

642
00:41:11,551 --> 00:41:14,067
Some say I'm mean,
some say I'm rude.

643
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:16,109
Yes, I'm Enad and I have the jar.

644
00:41:16,271 --> 00:41:18,389
I've got all the riches and I'm gonna go far.

645
00:41:28,591 --> 00:41:31,300
Ever wonder what I'm gonna do with
all that beautiful money.

646
00:41:32,951 --> 00:41:33,988
Listen up.

647
00:41:34,271 --> 00:41:36,662
I'm gonna sell it all,
I'm gonna buy a bank.

648
00:41:36,791 --> 00:41:38,863
I'll have my own chauffeur,
and Amine to thank.

649
00:41:39,151 --> 00:41:41,143
I'll have the biggest palace you ever seen.

650
00:41:41,271 --> 00:41:43,468
I'll have lots of servants to cook and clean.

651
00:41:43,871 --> 00:41:47,946
You'll be right by my side right Cleo,
right, right, of course you will.

652
00:41:50,271 --> 00:41:51,581
Yeah!

653
00:41:52,951 --> 00:41:54,864
I am Enad I'm a real cool dude.

654
00:41:55,031 --> 00:41:57,262
Some say I'm mean,
some say I'm rude.

655
00:41:57,311 --> 00:41:59,463
Yes, I am Enad I have the jar.

656
00:41:59,631 --> 00:42:01,828
I've got all the riches and I'm gonna go far.

657
00:42:02,031 --> 00:42:04,149
I'll be so famous wherever I go.

658
00:42:04,311 --> 00:42:06,508
Like a big pop star with money to blow.

659
00:42:06,511 --> 00:42:08,629
The whole wide world will know my face.

660
00:42:09,031 --> 00:42:11,023
I'll be mobed by fans all
over the place, yahooooo...

661
00:42:23,511 --> 00:42:25,390
It's me Enad don't you recognize me?

662
00:42:25,511 --> 00:42:27,503
I am Enad a real cool dude.

663
00:42:27,791 --> 00:42:29,829
Some say I'm mean,
some say I'm rude.

664
00:42:30,111 --> 00:42:32,024
I am Enad, I have the jar.

665
00:42:32,351 --> 00:42:35,190
I've got all the riches and I'm gonna go far.

666
00:42:35,191 --> 00:42:37,900
Enad! Are you going some
place special?

667
00:42:38,591 --> 00:42:40,504
I need your help in the yard, okay?

668
00:42:40,551 --> 00:42:41,750
Ehh, ehh, I'm going out.

669
00:42:41,751 --> 00:42:44,381
Listen to me, give back the loot.

670
00:42:44,631 --> 00:42:46,384
Eh, are you crazy?

671
00:43:17,391 --> 00:43:19,304
Oh, I can't do it.

672
00:43:30,831 --> 00:43:32,425
But I have to do it. Oh.

673
00:43:44,191 --> 00:43:46,070
Knock! Knock!

674
00:43:46,231 --> 00:43:48,303
I'll be right there.

675
00:43:56,711 --> 00:43:59,022
Oh, that's strange, I thought
I heard someone knocking.

676
00:44:03,471 --> 00:44:05,509
Amine, Hasan, I know where the jar is!

677
00:44:09,191 --> 00:44:12,788
Ah yes, ah yes my pretties.
Let's go for a little ride.

678
00:44:12,991 --> 00:44:17,100
Off to the market we go to sell you for lots
of money to some other idiot ha ha ha ha...

679
00:44:17,991 --> 00:44:20,268
who gets you one day and loses you the next.
Aha ha ha ha...

680
00:44:24,151 --> 00:44:28,830
Loser, loser ha, ha, ha. Ahhh! Snakes!

681
00:44:28,831 --> 00:44:30,983
Go away! Stay where you are!

682
00:44:32,551 --> 00:44:33,861
Don't come near me!

683
00:44:34,871 --> 00:44:37,148
Get away from me you ugly beasts.

684
00:44:37,551 --> 00:44:39,987
Don't you dare come any closer! Aaaahhh!

685
00:44:42,151 --> 00:44:45,065
Wait a minute. Just let me take the
jar and I'll leave you alone.

686
00:44:45,711 --> 00:44:47,829
Please, I'll leave and never come back.

687
00:44:47,831 --> 00:44:49,107
Dad, come look!

688
00:44:49,391 --> 00:44:53,670
Leee, What am I going to do? I got to
hide somewhere. Where can I go?

689
00:44:53,871 --> 00:44:57,149
I've got to hide somewhere.
Where can I go?

690
00:44:58,031 --> 00:44:59,870
Over here... no over here is better.

691
00:44:59,871 --> 00:45:01,260
This is a damp and creepy place!

692
00:45:02,391 --> 00:45:03,940
I hope we find it quickly.

693
00:45:05,471 --> 00:45:07,020
Ya, it's really spooky here.

694
00:45:07,511 --> 00:45:10,220
You know dad, if the letter is true,

695
00:45:10,591 --> 00:45:12,902
then whoever hid it here must be
from the village,

696
00:45:13,791 --> 00:45:15,306
Someone who knows the place well.

697
00:45:16,791 --> 00:45:18,385
Hah, so where should we start?

698
00:45:18,671 --> 00:45:19,901
Let's split up.

699
00:45:20,191 --> 00:45:24,584
You look over there eahh,
and I'll look over here.

700
00:45:24,991 --> 00:45:26,585
Dad, did you hear anything?

701
00:45:26,871 --> 00:45:29,660
I don't, huh?

702
00:45:30,551 --> 00:45:33,181
Strange, where is that noise coming from?

703
00:45:35,231 --> 00:45:36,950
Yaaahhh!

704
00:45:38,951 --> 00:45:42,070
Over here, Hasan!
I found the jar!

705
00:45:42,151 --> 00:45:43,427
Really, dad!? Aahh!

706
00:45:44,431 --> 00:45:46,059
Where did these snakes come from?

707
00:45:46,711 --> 00:45:48,510
I'm not afraid of them. I'll fix'em.

708
00:45:48,511 --> 00:45:50,026
No Hasan! They're dangerous, let's go now.

709
00:45:50,351 --> 00:45:52,821
It's not worth it. We'll be hurt
if we don't act wisely. C'mon!

710
00:45:55,031 --> 00:45:57,865
Mmmm? Why you crummy old hat.

711
00:45:57,911 --> 00:45:59,346
I almost got caught because of you.

712
00:45:59,831 --> 00:46:02,745
Come'ere you jinx, back to where you belong.

713
00:46:04,191 --> 00:46:05,467
Aaaahhh!

714
00:46:06,231 --> 00:46:08,110
Oh great, that's all I need now.

715
00:46:08,231 --> 00:46:11,510
Well, I'm not going to let another ugly
creature stand in my way.

716
00:46:11,511 --> 00:46:14,220
Take that, and that, and that.

717
00:46:29,831 --> 00:46:32,347
C'mon snakes, they're no match for you.
Get rid of them!

718
00:46:38,031 --> 00:46:41,310
Oh no, I can't bear to look.

719
00:46:41,311 --> 00:46:43,622
C'mon snakes do your job
and get these jokers atta here.

720
00:46:43,631 --> 00:46:45,384
Look out behind you, Hasan!

721
00:47:03,351 --> 00:47:07,664
Eaahh! Over here, Hasan! Ah, ahhh! Ehhh...

722
00:47:09,351 --> 00:47:10,750
Quickly, Hasan,
I can't breathe anymore.

723
00:47:10,751 --> 00:47:13,790
Dad, Hold on dad,
I've almost got'em!

724
00:47:15,631 --> 00:47:16,907
Aha ha ha ha! Better you than me.

725
00:47:16,951 --> 00:47:18,579
Ha ha ha ha haaa...

726
00:47:19,351 --> 00:47:21,867
That will teach you for trying
to take my treasure.

727
00:47:22,231 --> 00:47:23,859
Aha ha ha ha ha!

728
00:47:31,311 --> 00:47:32,587
Oh, help me!

729
00:47:54,071 --> 00:47:58,908
Oh, no, the fire's getting out of control.

730
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:13,748
C'mon, dad, let's go home.

731
00:48:14,471 --> 00:48:17,146
No, I'm not leaving here without the jar.

732
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:19,707
But, dad, you're exhausted.

733
00:48:19,991 --> 00:48:22,825
I told you, Hasan,
I won't leave without the jar.

734
00:48:25,471 --> 00:48:26,860
Oh wait right here.

735
00:48:32,111 --> 00:48:34,581
Okay, I've got the jar, let's go.

736
00:48:36,631 --> 00:48:38,146
Now what am I gonna do?

737
00:48:38,831 --> 00:48:40,150
<i>This stolen money's going to burn us,</i>

738
00:48:40,151 --> 00:48:42,906
<i>and I don't want any part of it.
You can keep it.</i>

739
00:48:43,151 --> 00:48:46,623
Oh, I can't stand it when she's right. Well,
I'm not gonna give her the satisfaction.

740
00:48:46,631 --> 00:48:47,907
First I'm gonna get atta here.

741
00:48:49,791 --> 00:48:54,343
And then, and then I'm gonna get
that jar back. Now which way do I go?

742
00:48:56,791 --> 00:48:58,624
OK. Let's rest here for a while.

743
00:48:59,791 --> 00:49:03,581
If it weren't for your bravery,
we never would've gotten out.

744
00:49:03,911 --> 00:49:05,585
I'd always risk my life for you.

745
00:49:07,391 --> 00:49:11,101
Ahh, you're quite a young man.
And thank goodness for that.

746
00:49:16,591 --> 00:49:24,341
Oh, I've gotta get outta this foul
wretched cave. It's not fair.

747
00:49:25,471 --> 00:49:27,190
I came in here as the king of the world...

748
00:49:27,231 --> 00:49:28,984
...now I have to leave like a scared rat.

749
00:49:29,231 --> 00:49:32,350
Ahh! Ahh! Water! Water! Water!
Aiieeeahh!

750
00:49:36,831 --> 00:49:38,061
That was close!

751
00:49:40,231 --> 00:49:41,507
Uh, are you okay now, dad?

752
00:49:42,151 --> 00:49:44,030
Do you think it would be alright
if we went home?

753
00:49:44,151 --> 00:49:48,430
Sorry, son, but I won't rest until
I get this jar back to Al.

754
00:49:48,551 --> 00:49:51,545
Actually I'll be quite happy to get rid of it
sooner than later.

755
00:49:51,631 --> 00:49:52,907
Let's go.

756
00:49:54,111 --> 00:49:56,502
Haah! Did I hear correctly?
He's going to Al's?

757
00:49:57,311 --> 00:50:00,145
You're a stubborn man, Amine,
but you're no match for me.

758
00:50:00,231 --> 00:50:02,144
I guarantee that jar will be mine.

759
00:50:02,391 --> 00:50:04,349
Just you wait, just you wait!

760
00:50:08,871 --> 00:50:11,270
Ahh, this is truly valuable!

761
00:50:11,271 --> 00:50:12,990
Where did you say you found it, Hasan?

762
00:50:12,991 --> 00:50:15,110
In the East wall in the courtyard
of the house.

763
00:50:15,111 --> 00:50:17,661
Oh, ya right, that ancient wall.

764
00:50:18,871 --> 00:50:23,867
How lucky for us all. The contents of this
jar must be worth a fortune.

765
00:50:24,151 --> 00:50:26,790
Lucky for us all? But it only belongs to you.

766
00:50:26,791 --> 00:50:28,943
No, no. I was just joking.

767
00:50:28,951 --> 00:50:32,104
It only belongs to you, Amine. Don't
you remember the deed?

768
00:50:32,631 --> 00:50:33,941
Hello everyone.

769
00:50:34,191 --> 00:50:35,390
Hello Samantha.

770
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:37,230
How are you Samantha?

771
00:50:37,231 --> 00:50:38,541
Very well thank you.

772
00:50:43,951 --> 00:50:47,787
Oh, c'mon, Amine, it's not an issue.
Have some coffee now.

773
00:50:47,951 --> 00:50:49,420
Here you are.

774
00:50:51,711 --> 00:50:53,146
Thank you, Samantha.

775
00:50:59,031 --> 00:51:02,867
That was great by the way,
Muriel said to say "hi".

776
00:51:03,111 --> 00:51:04,387
Oh, thank you.

777
00:51:06,231 --> 00:51:07,630
Anyway, Al,

778
00:51:07,631 --> 00:51:10,864
I feel like the jewels are a heavy
burden around my neck choking me.

779
00:51:10,911 --> 00:51:12,983
Please take them away.

780
00:51:13,511 --> 00:51:18,310
No, Amine, I refuse to take them.
They don't belong to me, OK?

781
00:51:18,311 --> 00:51:21,510
What if one of your relatives hid it
in the wall a long time ago.

782
00:51:21,511 --> 00:51:26,590
Uh ah! Now I won't hear anymore about it,
Amine the jar is yours and that's final.

783
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:28,902
Oh, c'mon, Al,
I really don't want the jar.

784
00:51:29,271 --> 00:51:31,866
Please take it and put it to
good use some how.

785
00:51:31,951 --> 00:51:34,262
Excuse me, would you like to hear my idea?

786
00:51:34,551 --> 00:51:35,986
By all means, dear.

787
00:51:36,591 --> 00:51:38,743
Why don't you let Uncle Fadel decide?

788
00:51:39,071 --> 00:51:41,541
He's wise and fair...
and would make the right decision.

789
00:51:41,671 --> 00:51:44,266
That's a great idea! What do you think,
Amine?

790
00:51:44,431 --> 00:51:48,346
Perfect, let's go. Hopefully it'll work.

791
00:51:49,951 --> 00:51:51,227
Let's go then.

792
00:51:52,551 --> 00:51:53,910
And that's the whole story.

793
00:51:53,911 --> 00:51:55,230
So, what do you think?

794
00:51:55,231 --> 00:51:56,950
It belongs to Al, right?

795
00:51:58,031 --> 00:52:00,740
Well... it's not that simple.

796
00:52:01,031 --> 00:52:05,549
I'll need to do more thinking. You mind
if I take more time to decide?

797
00:52:05,591 --> 00:52:07,140
Take whatever time you need.

798
00:52:07,631 --> 00:52:10,147
Why do you need to think?
The answer is clear.

799
00:52:10,591 --> 00:52:14,381
No, no. Just give me until the morning,
okay, Amine?

800
00:52:14,591 --> 00:52:16,230
No, please keep it here with you.

801
00:52:16,231 --> 00:52:20,306
I've had it long enough and I just
don't want the responsibility anymore...

802
00:52:20,671 --> 00:52:23,221
Alright, alright,
I'll keep it here.

803
00:52:26,111 --> 00:52:28,581
It should be safe in here, I hope.

804
00:52:31,471 --> 00:52:33,190
Bye, Uncle Fadel.
See you tomorrow, goodbye.

805
00:52:33,191 --> 00:52:34,660
Goodbye come back tomorrow.

806
00:52:42,471 --> 00:52:46,147
This glue aught to catch them red
handed and sticky fingered.

807
00:52:56,351 --> 00:52:59,185
Owww! Ah hey watch where your going.

808
00:52:59,231 --> 00:53:00,950
Sorry, oh hey, I turned around.

809
00:53:00,951 --> 00:53:02,784
I don't know why I bring him along
on these capers.

810
00:53:10,911 --> 00:53:12,426
Yaaaooow!

811
00:53:16,111 --> 00:53:20,026
Aw, could it be, aww daa...
No I don't think so.

812
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:22,902
Aw oh yeah, how about aww...

813
00:53:23,191 --> 00:53:27,300
No, no, no... Wait a minute!
Yea bingo that's it.

814
00:53:27,671 --> 00:53:30,460
Hey boss, come here,
you gotta see this.

815
00:53:31,791 --> 00:53:34,421
Look! A big bull must've laid it. Moooo!

816
00:53:36,111 --> 00:53:38,786
What? A bull laid the egg.

817
00:53:39,351 --> 00:53:40,866
Why bulls don't lay eggs.

818
00:53:41,191 --> 00:53:44,503
Well yea, but I just thought since it
was so big that you know, owww...

819
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:49,988
Hey, last one there is a rotten egg.

820
00:53:56,231 --> 00:53:58,950
Come on, come on that away, that away.

821
00:53:58,951 --> 00:54:00,386

00:54:16,311 --> 00:54:17,746
Aw, thanks boss.
Ha, ha you're the best.

826
00:54:17,911 --> 00:54:19,869
Oooeeeaaa...

827
00:54:38,671 --> 00:54:41,107
AaaaAaaaAaaa!

828
00:54:55,991 --> 00:54:57,301
Hey!

829
00:54:58,071 --> 00:54:59,745
What've you got there, Nutty?

830
00:55:02,871 --> 00:55:04,590
So these guys are the thieves.

831
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:06,826
Way to go, Nutty.

832
00:55:07,031 --> 00:55:10,229
You're so clever.
You deserve a special reward for this.

833
00:55:11,031 --> 00:55:12,420
Hamal? Where are you?

834
00:55:12,431 --> 00:55:13,786
I'm right here, mommy!

835
00:55:38,911 --> 00:55:40,110
How are you today?

836
00:55:40,111 --> 00:55:43,309
I'm homeless and hungry and
I was told to come and see you.

837
00:55:43,791 --> 00:55:46,430
Welcome to my home.
Make yourself comfortable.

838
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:47,661
Thank you.

839
00:55:51,511 --> 00:55:52,900
You must be thirsty.

840
00:55:58,471 --> 00:56:01,988
Thank you. I was expecting something
a little sweeter than that.

841
00:56:02,191 --> 00:56:03,944
But I'm sure it will be okay with the food...

842
00:56:05,231 --> 00:56:07,349
...a nice chicken dinner would be perfect.

843
00:56:07,871 --> 00:56:09,545
With all the fixin's too...

844
00:56:09,831 --> 00:56:12,461
...and a delicious rich dessert
with chocolate sauce.

845
00:56:12,671 --> 00:56:14,868
You don't ask for much do you?

846
00:56:18,831 --> 00:56:20,425
He, he, ha, ha, ha!
He'll be busy for an hour. Ha ha ha!

847
00:56:23,191 --> 00:56:26,230
Doe bee doo, doo doo doo
Where are you?

848
00:56:26,511 --> 00:56:28,026
La, la, la, la, la.

849
00:56:28,911 --> 00:56:31,108
Not under here, maybe over here.

850
00:56:33,591 --> 00:56:35,140
It must be in here.

851
00:56:38,951 --> 00:56:43,790
Aha, ha, ha mine all mine,
mine heh heh heh. I'm right.

852
00:56:43,791 --> 00:56:47,024
I'm rich, I am king... Oh no humph!

853
00:56:49,391 --> 00:56:51,383
What am I gonna do? I'm gonna get caught.

854
00:57:05,191 --> 00:57:09,982
Uncle Fadel! Uncle Fadel! Are you there?

855
00:57:11,751 --> 00:57:14,870
Ah, good morning everyone.
Please come in, come in.

856
00:57:20,271 --> 00:57:23,390
So you're interested in upside down
animals are you?

857
00:57:23,831 --> 00:57:28,827
Yes, yes actually I know a lot about animals
and I read everything I can find on them.

858
00:57:29,431 --> 00:57:31,947
Oh, good for you. We never stop learning,
do we?

859
00:57:33,831 --> 00:57:35,797
Hmmm, have you
ever gone to a pond...

860
00:57:35,798 --> 00:57:38,747
...to watch the sharks and
whales eat all the little fish?

861
00:57:38,991 --> 00:57:41,746
Uh, uh, yes, yes.
It's quite a sight...

862
00:57:43,031 --> 00:57:44,500
He doesn't know
what he's talking about.

863
00:57:44,511 --> 00:57:45,900
Is this book yours?

864
00:57:46,031 --> 00:57:49,423
Oh, yes. Strange, I don't remember
leaving it there.

865
00:57:49,911 --> 00:57:53,590
Okay, uncle, did you find a solution
to our problem?

866
00:57:53,591 --> 00:57:57,108
Yes I have, and I think you'll be
pleased with my decision.

867
00:57:57,471 --> 00:57:59,630
Ehh, ehh, I can see you're busy now.

868
00:57:59,631 --> 00:58:03,190
so I'll just go out for a little walk
and I'll be back in an hour or so.

869
00:58:03,191 --> 00:58:05,627
Where did it go?
I know I put it in here.

870
00:58:06,471 --> 00:58:09,066
I need some fresh air.

871
00:58:09,271 --> 00:58:10,865
This is awful! It's gone.

872
00:58:11,471 --> 00:58:13,668
Maybe you put it somewhere else,
uncle Fadel.

873
00:58:13,671 --> 00:58:17,063
No, no, I put it in the box.
I haven't lost my mind yet.

874
00:58:17,991 --> 00:58:19,267
Why are you looking at me?

875
00:58:19,631 --> 00:58:23,270
Search me if you like, you won't
find a single piece of gold.

876
00:58:23,271 --> 00:58:26,947
Excuse me? How did you know
it had gold in it, huh?

877
00:58:27,271 --> 00:58:29,741
Uh, I just assumed it would be
something valuable.

878
00:58:30,031 --> 00:58:31,830
Excuse me, but I have to make sure.

879
00:58:32,911 --> 00:58:34,790
Stop it Hasan!
What are you doing?

880
00:58:35,511 --> 00:58:37,822
Uh, I'm sorry, dad. Uh,
I was just trying to help.

881
00:58:38,391 --> 00:58:40,702
You see? I didn't steal anything.
Is this anyway to treat a pa, poor man?

882
00:58:42,431 --> 00:58:45,026
But, but sir, please, please don't go.

883
00:58:45,111 --> 00:58:47,945
Very strange. It's a real mystery.

884
00:59:25,871 --> 00:59:28,944
Ahhhh, hah ha ha ha...

885
00:59:29,551 --> 00:59:30,667
Aaaaahhhhh!

886
00:59:30,791 --> 00:59:33,307
I caught you red handed! Huh?

887
00:59:33,671 --> 00:59:35,350
You scared me! Please be merciful,
Hasan!

888
00:59:35,351 --> 00:59:37,150
Please, I'll do anything you want.

889
00:59:37,951 --> 00:59:39,270
Enad?

890
00:59:39,271 --> 00:59:41,423
How could you possibly do this?

891
00:59:43,151 --> 00:59:45,030
Give it to me, you pathetic dog.

892
00:59:45,311 --> 00:59:47,064
What kind of neighbor are you?

893
01:00:10,031 --> 01:00:11,190
Bye for now!

894
01:00:11,191 --> 01:00:12,660
Bye!

895
01:00:12,871 --> 01:00:14,784
Bye, bye.

896
01:00:14,791 --> 01:00:16,385
Congratulations on your wedding.

897
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:17,750
Oh, thank you very much.

898
01:00:17,751 --> 01:00:21,230
You've brought great happiness to the hearts
of the people of this village.

899
01:00:21,231 --> 01:00:24,225
Eh heh, thanks to your judgement
and wise decision.

900
01:00:24,591 --> 01:00:27,590
Oh, that reminds me, we've donated the
money to the poor...

901
01:00:27,591 --> 01:00:29,265
...gave the bride and groom their share...

902
01:00:29,471 --> 01:00:30,747
...and this remains for you.

903
01:00:30,991 --> 01:00:33,507
Well, Hamel, what should we do with it?

904
01:00:33,991 --> 01:00:36,905
I know, I would like a new pet to start
my zoo!

905
01:00:37,271 --> 01:00:40,105
Okay, son, tomorrow
we'll go to the village...

906
01:00:40,311 --> 01:00:41,826
...and pick out a pet of your choice.

907
01:00:41,871 --> 01:00:46,150
Yahaay! I finally get to buy
a beautiful peacock.

908
01:00:46,951 --> 01:00:51,026
Hmm, I got it! The bridge! The bridge needs
repair to be safe again.

909
01:00:51,191 --> 01:00:54,185
Ah, great idea.
Hasan and there's plenty here.

910
01:00:54,591 --> 01:00:55,950
What's this for?

911
01:00:55,951 --> 01:00:57,750
Well, It's your share of the jar.

912
01:00:57,751 --> 01:01:00,665
But I can't accept this.
Have you forgotten what Enad did?

913
01:01:03,991 --> 01:01:05,506
What'll I do, Cleo?

914
01:01:06,831 --> 01:01:08,550
Can you believe what they did to me?

915
01:01:08,711 --> 01:01:13,627
I don't deserve to be in prison.
I'm a good man.

916
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:15,626
This is no place for me.

917
01:01:15,671 --> 01:01:20,189
They marry off Hasan with my money, and
I'm left to live in here like a rat.

918
01:01:24,191 --> 01:01:25,501
At least rats can live free.

919
01:01:26,511 --> 01:01:31,701
All my dreams of being rich have turned
to living nightmares.

920
01:01:41,751 --> 01:01:44,062
I really wish we could trade places, Cleo.

921
01:01:45,311 --> 01:01:46,630
What!

922
01:01:46,631 --> 01:01:49,420
Don't leave me, Cleo!
You're my only friend in the wooorld!
