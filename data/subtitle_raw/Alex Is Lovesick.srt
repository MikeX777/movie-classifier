Alex.

22
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:52,965
l might have known
it was Alexander.

23
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:54,633
Come up here to the board.

24
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:59,513
Who me?
-No, your grandfather.

25
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,474
My grandfather can't come.
He's dead.

26
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:05,561
l' ll show you what dead
means.

27
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:07,980
ln another minute,
you' ll be dead.

28
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:10,732
Go to the board at once.

29
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:16,655
Come on. Now.
Punishment.

30
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:20,409
Say 50 times:

31
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:25,539
" Naked girls that's
an abomination."

32
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,332
Now say it the first time.

33
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:31,378
Naked girls

34
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:34,840
No disturbing!
Second time!

35
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:37,509
Naked girls,

00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:41,722

00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:54,401
Go back to your own place.
Now.

41
00:03:56,904 --> 00:04:01,408
Today we have a new student.

42
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:04,786
The name.
-Mimi.

43
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:10,250
The name is Mima.
-My name is Mimi. -What?

44
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:13,170
Mimi. -What sort of a name is
that. Meemeemee...

45
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,089
l say it's Mima.

46
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:22,095
She greets the class
and says Hallo.

47
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:26,308
So? And says Hallo.
-Hallo.

48
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:32,689
So what the class says
to Mima?

49
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:36,902
Naked girls,
that's an abomination.

50
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:38,153
What's that?

51
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:43,700
That teacher is a real
nut-case. ls he the only one?

52
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:47,496
That one is reckoned normal.
Wait till you see the others.

53
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,873
l hope you don't have a lot
of homework.

54
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:52,084
As it happens, we do have
lots of homework

55
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,794
but l can always help you
if you like.

56
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:56,713
No, that's alright. -Do you
need a lift home?

57
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:59,132
l can take you on my bike.

58
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,927
No thanks, they've come to
take me home. Bye.

59
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:04,930
Bye.

60
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:21,280
So, did you fix anything?
-With her? What on earth for?

61
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:22,990
So what were you talking
about all the time?

62
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,033
She just wanted help with
her lessons.

63
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:27,244
You' re just wet. She's
a real good looker.

64
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:29,580
Hi Alex, did you bring back
my pictures?

65
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:31,707
Yes, but they were
confiscated. -Who took them?

66
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:33,625
Leonid, the teacher took
all the pictures.

67
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:37,171
l told you to be careful. They
were the best ones l had.

68
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,339
l' m sorry, he took them off
Fishenson.

69
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:41,091
lt's all because of that
son-of-a-bitch.

70
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:43,969
l hope he didn't say
who they belonged to.

71
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:46,388
lf my father hears about this
he' ll beat me black and blue

72
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:49,016
with his belt.
-Here's that idiot.

73
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:57,024
C' mon gang. Let's get him.

74
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:18,295
He's coming.

75
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:30,057
Fishenson! You again.
Fishenson!

76
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,773
l caught you.
-But l didn't...

77
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:06,426
Alexander!

78
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:15,185
Alexander, is that you?
-Yes.

79
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,691
Why are you so late?
lt's almost night time.

80
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,150
l was at Ginger's.
We were studying together.

81
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:23,610
Well alright. Go and shower.

82
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:26,321
After. -No, not after. Your
father' ll be here any minute

83
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,031
and the food is all ready.
-What are we eating?

84
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,367
What you like. Take a clean
towel and go shower.

85
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:32,119
Alexander, don't wipe your
feet on that towel.

86
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:33,912
Take the blue towel
for your feet.

87
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:35,414
l can't get washed, there's
someone in there.

88
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:37,040
lt's no-one. lt must be Farouk.

89
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:40,169
Mr. Farouk?

90
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,173
Farouk, do you hear me?

91
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:46,758
l' m sorry but l've put on my
hair treatment.

92
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:48,719
Your hair treatment doesn't
interest me Mr. Farouk.

93
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:51,555
The child has to shower.
-But Mrs. Koprovsky,

94
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:53,765
l only put on the tomato paste
two minutes ago with the

95
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:57,394
frog powder. That only leaves
the parsley and scorpion oil.

96
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:59,396
and l've finished. -Farouk,
it's all rubbish.

97
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:02,441
You' ll grow hair on your head,
the day l grow wings.

98
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:05,819
That's where you' re wrong,
Mrs. Koprovsky.

99
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:09,615
Soon l' ll have a head of hair
like James Dean.

100
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:10,949
l' m fed up with all your
tenants.

101
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:14,203
Quiet, we have money problems.
and we' re lucky he's here.

102
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:15,829
Farouk? Are you
coming out?

103
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,498
What's up Mrs. Koprovsky?
You inviting me to the opera?

104
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:24,421
We need a murderer like him at
home? -Don't give him ideas.

105
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:28,592
You' ll see. That Farouk will
kill us all again.

106
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:31,720
Come my angel, l've got
something for you.

107
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:34,139
l hope it's not chocolate
before supper.

108
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:37,809
Who said anything about
chocolate.

109
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:42,189
From chocolate you get the
belly ache.

110
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:43,607
Farouk, get out of there.

111
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:46,401
lf you upset me, l don't come
out till New Year

112
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,154
Like l would give him chocolate!

113
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:52,783
Take it my angel. Take it
and eat it quickly

114
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,869
before your mother
goes crazy.

115
00:08:56,161 --> 00:09:00,624
All this? -Why not? No one
ever died of eating chocolate.

116
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,334
Angel-face.

117
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:06,797
Mrs. Koprovsky, maybe you
wont grow wings

118
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:10,676
but my hair has grown two and
a half centimeters..

119
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:16,139
Moron. Get out. Alexander
you can go in.

120
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:17,766
The Farouk is out!

121
00:09:53,177 --> 00:09:53,927
Well hi there Alex.

122
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:55,220
Hi there. Have you seen
Ginger?

123
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:56,638
l think he's over there.

124
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:58,432
Give' us a bite.-l don't
take the food out of my mouth.

125
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,641
Honestly, don't be so mean.

126
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:01,185
Well don't take a big bite.

127
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:05,606
Are you and Ginger going to
see " Gone With the Wind" ?

128
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:07,482
Maybe.-lt's not worth while.
lt's a crappy movie.

129
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,443
What are you talking about.
l've seen it three times.

130
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:13,989
lf it's such a crappy film, why
see it three times?

131
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:16,617
l didn't pay , l snuck in round
the back, so what do l care?

132
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:22,372
Leave the hot dog for me. Hey
You didn't even leave me half.

133
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:25,626
You owe me one hot dog.
-Alright, alright.

134
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,382
What's going on? Are you
coming to see the movie?

135
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:35,552
lt's not worth it. l've fixed it up
with two good looking chicks.

136
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,638
We know your dogs already
When are they coming?

137
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:39,973
Any minute now.
-How old are they?

138
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:42,726
Big. ln high school. You can
do what you want with them.

139
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:45,187
They've got boobs like this,
like watermelons.

140
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:47,314
Hi guys. You going to the
movie?

141
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:50,108
Ginger, tell your brother to
leave us alone.

142
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:53,278
Yanosh, how am l in the way?
Shuky, say l' m not in the way.

143
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:54,738
Go on get out of here already.
Motke go!

144
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:56,323
Don't want to. Mom gave
me permission.

145
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,784
lf the chicks see him, they' ll
go for certain.

146
00:10:58,951 --> 00:11:00,911
Are there girls? -Motke, l told
you a million times,

147
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:03,247
stop following me everywhere.
Get out of here.

148
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:06,333
l don't care. Mom says l can
stay out till 9:00.

149
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:08,752
Yanosh, will there really be
chicks?

150
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,796
Shut up! Here they come.

151
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:18,512
These are Malcah and Zippy.
Pleased to meet you.

152
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:22,432
Hi, Yanosh has told us a lot
about you.

153
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:26,979
Yanosh, when will the chicks
you told us about come?

154
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:31,608
Girls, do you want to go to
the beach?

155
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:44,538
Guys, have a good time. l' m
going to see the movie.

156
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:47,833
Alex, wait up a minute. l' m
coming with you.

157
00:11:48,584 --> 00:11:49,918
They' re just dogs.

158
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:53,213
Let's go. What a good job
we got rid of them.

159
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,133
Now we' ll be able to have a
really wild time.

160
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:58,677
Take your hands off me, idiot.

161
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:01,680
You' re just pretending that you
don't like me. You do really.

162
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:12,191
Hi girls! -Hi there.

163
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:15,277
Someone sitting here? -Yes.
-Who? -You.

164
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:18,280
What are you doing here.
-Same as you.

165
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:19,573
l came to see the movie.

166
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:26,496
Why are you sitting near me?
-l need an explanation.

167
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:28,624
So go and sit close and read
the subtitles.

168
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:32,044
l can't read the small writing.

00:26:15,576 --> 00:26:16,702
Are you looking at my money?

334
00:26:16,869 --> 00:26:18,245
No! Stop looking.

335
00:26:21,623 --> 00:26:25,002
So be it. -Mrs. Yaacov,

336
00:26:25,627 --> 00:26:30,465
Perhaps l could get,
l saw some nuts inside.

337
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,426
Lady, those are my
husband's nuts.

338
00:26:33,093 --> 00:26:37,097
Then maybe l could get
a little meat for my boy.

339
00:26:37,806 --> 00:26:42,895
There is meat here for soup.
-ls there any chicken?

340
00:26:43,228 --> 00:26:47,107
Yes. Today they bring from
farm. -Mr Yaacov, how much?

341
00:26:47,316 --> 00:26:49,818
For why you shouting? All
the neighbors can hear.

342
00:26:49,985 --> 00:26:52,279
How much?
-l' ll give you a good price.

343
00:26:52,446 --> 00:26:55,199
Yaacov, get some chicken.
-Here.

344
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,870
But it's alive.
-l told you it was fresh.

345
00:27:00,329 --> 00:27:01,496
Look how lovely it is.

346
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:04,708
lf you not want to eat it,
it can bring every day

347
00:27:04,875 --> 00:27:08,045
fresh eggs. -What eggs?
lt's a cockerel, not a hen.

348
00:27:08,212 --> 00:27:10,380
You boy, don't speak here.
-You be quiet.

349
00:27:10,506 --> 00:27:13,050
Before you were born,
l knew what a hen was.

350
00:27:13,175 --> 00:27:14,885
But Mom, it's not a hen,
it's a cockerel.

351
00:27:14,968 --> 00:27:16,220
Alexander, be quiet.

352
00:27:20,557 --> 00:27:23,435
Alexander be quiet, l say.

353
00:27:24,436 --> 00:27:26,188
l told you, we don't need
no pigeons here.

354
00:27:27,314 --> 00:27:30,692
What's this chicken...
-Children are crap.

355
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:09,022
Gently, softly.

356
00:28:10,274 --> 00:28:12,985
Not nice. Mrs. Koprovsky
can hear sweetie.

357
00:28:14,236 --> 00:28:17,573
Don't go wild, don't go wild.

358
00:28:18,323 --> 00:28:20,993
Your lips are like a crocodile.

359
00:28:26,665 --> 00:28:29,543
What's this? Am l dreaming?

360
00:28:29,835 --> 00:28:30,961
Heaven preserve me.

361
00:28:32,546 --> 00:28:36,466
This isn't a dream. lt's a ghost

362
00:28:36,758 --> 00:28:39,595
A ghost has come to take me.
Help!

363
00:28:39,887 --> 00:28:44,016
Help me, Mrs. Koprovsky,
Mr. Kova.

364
00:28:44,433 --> 00:28:46,351
Help me! l' m on fire.

365
00:28:49,938 --> 00:28:53,108
Help! Why won't
anyone help me.

366
00:28:53,317 --> 00:28:56,361
l' m dying. l' m not asking a lot.

367
00:28:56,486 --> 00:28:58,322
l' m just going to get some
tablets from the kitchen.

368
00:28:58,530 --> 00:28:59,948
l' ll be back in a minute,
don't worry.

369
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,912
Help, a ghost has come
to get me.

370
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:09,958
Help me Mr. Kova.
-Why have you gone crazy?

371
00:29:10,459 --> 00:29:12,836
Mr. Kova, l' m dying and ghosts
came to take me away.

372
00:29:13,045 --> 00:29:15,714
Why are you talking rubbish?
-Save me Mr. Kova.

373
00:29:15,881 --> 00:29:18,509
He's going to kill me.
-So he' ll kill you, madman.

374
00:29:18,926 --> 00:29:20,511
Show me some pity.
-Get out of here.

375
00:29:21,178 --> 00:29:23,263
l...l' m a protected tenant.

376
00:29:23,722 --> 00:29:27,768
Go away. -So who will
save me? -Madman!

377
00:29:29,645 --> 00:29:32,231
Help! Can anyone hear me?

378
00:29:32,606 --> 00:29:35,108
Neighbors! ghosts have come
to take me away. Help!

379
00:29:35,734 --> 00:29:39,321
l' m going to die. lt's such
a pity. Only 40 years old.

380
00:29:39,613 --> 00:29:42,241
So young. Who should l
leave my gold teeth to?

381
00:29:43,534 --> 00:29:46,495
Mr. Ghost, forgive me.
l' ll do the cleaning for you.

382
00:29:46,787 --> 00:29:49,081
l' ll wash your dirty socks.

383
00:29:51,166 --> 00:29:55,045
My last request, Mr. Ghost,
please don't kill me.

384
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:14,439
What's all this? get out
of here murderer.

385
00:30:15,357 --> 00:30:17,943
Aren't you ashamed?
With a woman at my age.

386
00:30:20,696 --> 00:30:23,448
Where am l? ln paradise?

387
00:30:24,116 --> 00:30:25,784
lt doesn't hurt at all to die.

388
00:30:26,952 --> 00:30:28,412
Sweetie, you' re also here.

389
00:31:04,364 --> 00:31:08,493
Kerosene, Kerosene!

390
00:31:09,036 --> 00:31:09,953
Alexander, get a move on.

391
00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:15,542
Just look at that line.

392
00:31:19,671 --> 00:31:21,173
Keep the place,
l' ll be right back.

393
00:31:21,298 --> 00:31:23,509
Where are you going?
-To get some without the line.

394
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:26,094
Mom don't make a show
of yourself. -Trust me.

395
00:31:26,512 --> 00:31:28,472
Excuse me? -What you
want Lady?

396
00:31:29,056 --> 00:31:30,599
Excuse me. -A moment
you see there's a line here.

397
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:33,894
Perhaps you can help me.

398
00:31:34,061 --> 00:31:36,897
l have a sick child at home.
-Lady, l' m not a doctor,

399
00:31:37,064 --> 00:31:39,608
l sell kerosene. Take him
to the clinic!

400
00:31:39,816 --> 00:31:42,736
Just a small tin, please.
-l' m sorry lady.

401
00:31:42,945 --> 00:31:46,114
A small tin is nothing, really!
-She wants special favors.

402
00:31:46,782 --> 00:31:49,785
l' m sorry Lady, there's a line.
-Some people are heartless.

403
00:31:50,452 --> 00:31:52,829
You should be ashamed of
yourself not standing in line.

404
00:31:53,121 --> 00:31:55,165
Lady, what are you doing?
-And you' re behind me

405
00:31:55,374 --> 00:31:57,334
But l was standing here.
-That's what you think.

406
00:31:57,668 --> 00:31:59,336
Alexander stand straight,
you' ll get a hunchback.

407
00:31:59,711 --> 00:32:02,673
Mr. Misha, do you have
any mail for me?

408
00:32:03,382 --> 00:32:06,051
Let's see. -Move forward.
Move up.

409
00:32:06,802 --> 00:32:08,136
From abroad. -Thank you.

410
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:09,429
Give me the stamps,
l want the stamps.

411
00:32:09,638 --> 00:32:11,431
Afterwards, first of all
let's see who it's from.

412
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:17,646
lt's from Lola, your Aunt Lola.
She's coming here.

413
00:32:17,855 --> 00:32:21,233
Who's Lola? -Lola's mother
was your father's cousin.

414
00:32:21,817 --> 00:32:23,610
Your father will be so pleased.

415
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:26,655
She' ll be here on time
for your Bar Mitzva.

416
00:32:27,239 --> 00:32:29,741
How much Lady?
-Two tins please.

417
00:32:31,243 --> 00:32:34,955
ls that your sick kid?
-No, his brother. The other

418
00:32:35,247 --> 00:32:37,165
one's at home. -Since when
do l have a brother?

419
00:32:37,583 --> 00:32:40,878
He's also sick. His memory
is not so good.

420
00:32:42,296 --> 00:32:44,339
Just wait till we get home.
Your father will get you.

421
00:32:49,511 --> 00:32:52,347
What are you looking at?
-l' m not looking at anything.

422
00:32:52,723 --> 00:32:55,017
You' re not? Your nose
is right in my letter.

423
00:32:55,225 --> 00:32:56,727
That's just what you think.
-Not just what l think.

424
00:32:58,395 --> 00:33:01,064
Go on read it then.
-Mom, that's enough.

425
00:33:01,273 --> 00:33:02,733
Alexander, stand straight.

426
00:33:04,568 --> 00:33:08,655
" Arise, awaken,
the light cometh.

427
00:33:09,156 --> 00:33:12,868
"The glory of the Lord
shines upon you.

428
00:33:13,076 --> 00:33:15,495
" For behold...for..."

429
00:33:15,913 --> 00:33:20,876
lf that's the way you' re going
to sing at your Bar Mitzva

430
00:33:21,168 --> 00:33:24,338
all the guests will run out
of the synagogue.

431
00:33:24,588 --> 00:33:27,466
Listen carefully and follow
me. You understand?

432
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,676
Good, begin.

433
00:33:29,927 --> 00:33:34,598
" Arise, awaken,
the light cometh,

434
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:38,477
The glory of the Lord
shines upon you.

435
00:33:38,769 --> 00:33:43,357
Your name should be
blotted out, you terrorist.

436
00:33:43,774 --> 00:33:47,236
Your name should be
blotted out, you terrorist.

437
00:33:47,653 --> 00:33:51,073
Are you making fun of me?

438
00:33:51,323 --> 00:33:55,077
You said to say what you say.
-Only what you need to say.

439
00:33:56,203 --> 00:33:59,498
But l didn't say to say
what's not needed.

440
00:33:59,831 --> 00:34:02,042
Carry on, non-believer.

441
00:34:03,335 --> 00:34:05,546
Read the book.

442
00:34:05,754 --> 00:34:08,632
" For darkness shall cover
the land.

443
00:34:08,924 --> 00:34:13,720
" And people lost in the mist

444
00:34:21,061 --> 00:34:24,231
" And God will shine on you."

445
00:35:05,147 --> 00:35:08,525
Rabbi, you have visitors.

446
00:35:08,734 --> 00:35:12,154
The guests have come.
-Peace be with you.

447
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:15,657
Oy vey!

448
00:35:16,074 --> 00:35:19,203
What's wrong? Why are you
in such a state?

449
00:35:19,411 --> 00:35:20,829
Oy vey.

450
00:35:21,205 --> 00:35:25,751
Lord of the universe.
-Are my fringes not kosher?

451
00:35:26,084 --> 00:35:27,169
Help!

452
00:35:30,047 --> 00:35:33,842
The train is arriving
on platform 2.

453
00:36:12,297 --> 00:36:15,509
Lola, this is my wife.

454
00:36:15,801 --> 00:36:17,719
Hallo Lola. -Hallo.

455
00:36:19,012 --> 00:36:22,474
Please meet Lola.
This is my family.

456
00:36:22,683 --> 00:36:24,601
You look good. -Thank you.
Please. -Thank you.

457
00:36:24,768 --> 00:36:28,313
This is my mother.
-What a beautiful woman!

458
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,485
And how does the lady feel?

459
00:36:33,861 --> 00:36:38,615
l want l speak only Hebrew.
-Well done.

460
00:36:39,157 --> 00:36:42,995
My boy, Alexander.
-Hallo Alex.

461
00:36:43,161 --> 00:36:46,999
Alex, say hallo nicely.
-Hallo.

462
00:36:48,292 --> 00:36:49,626
Go on, give her a kiss.

463
00:36:57,259 --> 00:36:59,928
-You a big girl
-l' m nearly...

464
00:37:00,179 --> 00:37:04,933
You' re a big boy.
-you a big boy.

465
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:08,228
l' m nearly 13.
-You are big girl.

466
00:37:08,395 --> 00:37:11,064
You are a big boy.
-Kova, stop correcting her.

467
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,816
Let's take the suitcases
and go home.

468
00:37:15,402 --> 00:37:17,029
Alexander, take her bag.

469
00:37:45,057 --> 00:37:46,892
Lolitchka, have another
chicken leg.

470
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,769
Thank you, but l've
really had enough.

471
00:37:49,102 --> 00:37:51,813
But a leg like mine, you
won't find in any restaurant.

472
00:37:52,022 --> 00:37:54,942
lsn't that right Kova? -lt's
true. Clara's legs are good.

473
00:37:55,192 --> 00:37:57,152
But really l can't,
not anymore.

474
00:37:57,778 --> 00:38:02,074
Sorry. -You know l hate you
putting food on my plate.

475
00:38:02,241 --> 00:38:03,575
Alexander, you eat it.

476
00:38:05,285 --> 00:38:06,537
Why are you giving it to me?
l hate chicken.

477
00:38:06,995 --> 00:38:08,830
Alexander, behave yourself
in front of guests.

478
00:38:09,164 --> 00:38:10,457
Kova, l' m really embarrassed.

479
00:38:11,083 --> 00:38:12,000
l don't want it.

480
00:38:13,335 --> 00:38:17,339
Lolitchka, perhaps you' ll
have a little chicken neck.

481
00:38:17,548 --> 00:38:19,842
lt's really very good.
-Stop nagging her.

482
00:38:20,175 --> 00:38:22,803
Perhaps you' ll have some
stuffing. -What? -Stuffing

483
00:38:23,011 --> 00:38:25,681
Thank you, l' m full. -Mom,
why don't you leave her alone.

484
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:28,517
How can l? She hasn't eaten
a thing, Kova.

485
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,687
Maybe you' d like some
stomachs. They' re good.

486
00:38:31,895 --> 00:38:35,065
Clara makes wonderful
stomachs. Eat, it's good.

487
00:38:35,357 --> 00:38:39,653
Hallo. l' m here.
-That's all l needed.

488
00:38:40,779 --> 00:38:45,701
l' m sorry l' m late. l hope
you started without me.

489
00:38:46,201 --> 00:38:48,537
l' d like to introduce Farouk.
He's our tenant.

490
00:38:48,954 --> 00:38:50,831
That's not a tenant.
lt's a murderer.

491
00:38:52,624 --> 00:38:54,585
Lola, pleased to meet you.

492
00:38:57,671 --> 00:39:02,426
Miss Lola, l very, very happy
to be meeting you.

493
00:39:06,889 --> 00:39:09,224
Farouk, close the shutter,
we' re at the table.

494
00:39:47,137 --> 00:39:48,680
Farouk, eat with your
mouth closed.

495
00:39:57,856 --> 00:40:00,651
Miss Lola, you come special
for Alex Bar Mitzva?

496
00:40:00,943 --> 00:40:05,197
Or you hear l am a bachelor?
-l came for private reasons.

497
00:40:05,656 --> 00:40:08,367
l came to find my fiancee.

498
00:40:08,617 --> 00:40:10,536
What? -To find my friend.
-l see.

499
00:40:10,786 --> 00:40:14,122
He's called Tadeck.
-What? Tadeck Kamelly.

500
00:40:15,958 --> 00:40:19,419
We were going to be married.
That was before the war.

501
00:40:21,046 --> 00:40:26,552
Then the Nazis took him, and
since then l hear nothing.

502
00:40:26,969 --> 00:40:32,224
They said he was dead.
Then my girl friend's brother

503
00:40:32,432 --> 00:40:35,060
said someone like him was
seen here in lsrael.

504
00:40:35,644 --> 00:40:38,188
Do you have his address?

505
00:40:40,357 --> 00:40:42,860
You have to go to the
Missing Persons Bureau.

506
00:40:43,068 --> 00:40:45,737
What's that? -They look
for lost relatives.

507
00:40:46,113 --> 00:40:48,532
lt's worth a try, and really

508
00:40:48,782 --> 00:40:51,326
Lola, l hope that you find him.

509
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:54,288
But if not, remember
that l' m free.

510
00:40:54,913 --> 00:40:57,207
That's good. Take a look
at the murderer.

511
00:41:18,687 --> 00:41:20,731
" And the glory of the Lord
shall shine,"

512
00:41:20,898 --> 00:41:22,816
Shine, yes. " For behold
the darkness..."

513
00:41:39,583 --> 00:41:41,835
Hi there Fishenson. Did you
bring the stamps? -Yes, 30.

514
00:41:42,127 --> 00:41:43,420
Tell me, do you think
l' m a sucker?

515
00:41:43,712 --> 00:41:46,965
You think you can see my
sister naked for 30 stamps?

516
00:41:47,174 --> 00:41:48,800
Ginger will give you another

517
00:41:48,967 --> 00:41:51,929
She's here. lf he doesn't
show soon, it' ll be too late.

518
00:41:53,555 --> 00:41:55,516
Why did you have to bring
your idiot brother?

519
00:41:55,766 --> 00:41:57,559
Alright, he won't bother you.
Here are your stamps.

520
00:41:57,726 --> 00:41:59,436
But he has to go home.

521
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,897
Be quiet. -That doesn't
interest me.

522
00:42:02,231 --> 00:42:05,901
What do you care Fishenson?
l' ll bring you 50 stamps.

523
00:42:06,318 --> 00:42:08,487
Don't want them. He' ll go
and tell the whole street

524
00:42:08,862 --> 00:42:11,615
that he saw my sister
Fritzia, naked.

525
00:42:11,823 --> 00:42:14,201
He won't say a word Motke.
-l won't say, l won't say.

526
00:42:14,409 --> 00:42:15,744
No way.

527
00:42:15,994 --> 00:42:17,871
l' ll give you 100 stamps.

528
00:42:18,205 --> 00:42:22,835
Tell him Shuky. Tell him l' ll

529
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,837
l want to see Fritzi naked.

530
00:42:25,045 --> 00:42:29,633
Make sure you've got 100
stamps. -l have, at home.

531
00:42:29,842 --> 00:42:33,720
l knew you wanted to trick me.
-No, l' ll give them to you.

532
00:42:33,887 --> 00:42:35,639
l' ll give you my watch.
Take my watch.

533
00:42:35,806 --> 00:42:38,183
lt's his Bar Mitzva watch.
ldiot. Dad will kill you.

534
00:42:38,433 --> 00:42:41,228
l don't care, l want to see
Fritzi naked.

535
00:42:41,436 --> 00:42:44,815
But she must be completely
naked. -lt's guaranteed idiot.

536
00:42:45,858 --> 00:42:47,734
Heaven help you if you' re
not quiet.

537
00:42:48,235 --> 00:42:49,903
Here, she's coming.
Come on.

538
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:58,495
Wow, what a cutie! -You bet.
Best looking ass in lsrael.

539
00:42:58,912 --> 00:43:00,706
Where can we peek?
-The shower's best

540
00:43:00,873 --> 00:43:03,542
But will she be completely
naked? Of course, idiot.

541
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:05,794
What do you think, that she
showers with her coat on?

542
00:43:08,338 --> 00:43:09,464
Come on, follow me.

543
00:43:14,761 --> 00:43:15,721
Now, climb up.

544
00:43:17,014 --> 00:43:20,392
But if she closes the window?
She can't. -Why?

545
00:43:20,642 --> 00:43:24,146
l took the whole window out
together with the curtain.

546
00:43:25,063 --> 00:43:27,941
But will she be naked?
-Shut up, climb up quietly.

547
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,818
Why are you kissing me idiot?

548
00:43:39,828 --> 00:43:41,622
She's going to be naked.

549
00:43:43,832 --> 00:43:45,083
Ssh! She's coming.

550
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:57,888
So? How are her boobs?
Like apples aren't they?

551
00:43:59,723 --> 00:44:02,392
Guys, the son of a bitch
has tricked us.

552
00:44:02,976 --> 00:44:04,686
lt's not Fritzi, it's her father.

553
00:44:05,062 --> 00:44:07,689
What are you doing here?
-Dear God almighty.

554
00:44:07,856 --> 00:44:09,858
Where are you going?
lt's not Fritzi, it's her father.

555
00:44:10,067 --> 00:44:11,109
l want Fritzi naked.

556
00:44:11,276 --> 00:44:14,196
Get out of here.
l' m going to kill you.

557
00:45:20,971 --> 00:45:25,017
Fishenson, it's you again!
-lt's not me Sir.

558
00:45:29,062 --> 00:45:32,316
Breathe in! -Alex, breathe in.
-Hold it! -Hold lt.

559
00:45:32,649 --> 00:45:35,152
Madam? -What? -Breathe in.

560
00:45:35,319 --> 00:45:37,613
l hope you' re not playing up
to get out of going to school.

561
00:45:37,863 --> 00:45:39,406
Who's playing up?
l don't feel well.

562
00:45:39,615 --> 00:45:41,450
Hold your breath. -Not
feeling well isn't a reason

563
00:45:41,617 --> 00:45:45,162
for not going to school.
-Don't breathe.

564
00:45:45,662 --> 00:45:48,081
Open you mouth please.
-Your mouth, wide.

565
00:45:49,958 --> 00:45:54,087
Yes,yes. -Doctor, l hope
it's not serious

566
00:45:54,505 --> 00:45:58,008
He's got a children's disease.
-What? -He's got chicken pox.

567
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:00,636
He must lie down
and not go to school.

568
00:46:01,094 --> 00:46:03,597
That's exactly what l said,
Doctor. You hear Alex?

569
00:46:03,805 --> 00:46:06,892
You don't go to school. You
have a dangerous illness.

570
00:46:07,059 --> 00:46:10,854
Don't worry. lt's good he's got
it when he's young.

571
00:46:11,021 --> 00:46:13,148
l hope it's over by his
Bar Mitzva and

572
00:46:13,357 --> 00:46:16,610
Won't spoil the celebration.
-When is your Bar Mitzva?

573
00:46:16,818 --> 00:46:19,029
Tell the doctor.
lt's in another 3 months.

574
00:46:19,696 --> 00:46:22,449
He' ll be better in two weeks.
-Thank God.

575
00:46:22,616 --> 00:46:26,828
Should he be on diet?
-No, he can eat everything.

576
00:46:27,079 --> 00:46:29,248
You hear that Alex? -Yes.

577
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:44,555
Miss Lola, l request you

578
00:46:44,763 --> 00:46:46,390
that you iron me my pants.

579
00:46:46,598 --> 00:46:48,684
Farouk, leave her alone, you
see that Alex is sick.

580
00:46:48,934 --> 00:46:51,353
Sorry, dear Alex, please,
not be worried.

581
00:46:54,231 --> 00:46:57,442
l think he have collywobbles.
-Not so. He has chicken pox.

582
00:46:57,651 --> 00:46:59,862
Chicken pox? ls it catching?

583
00:47:00,153 --> 00:47:02,114
Sure it is. -lt's catching?

584
00:47:02,865 --> 00:47:05,993
Oh dear. The Lord protect me.
My hands touch him.

585
00:47:06,493 --> 00:47:08,203
Mrs. Koprovsky, l see red.

586
00:47:09,788 --> 00:47:11,957
l feel dizzy. -Take the
watermelon off your head.

587
00:47:12,082 --> 00:47:15,002
Then you won't feel dizzy.
-l request doctor, quick.

588
00:47:15,294 --> 00:47:19,131
Here's a glass of tea. -Please,
get me an ambulance.

589
00:47:19,631 --> 00:47:22,968
l' ll get the Burial Society
for you, you animal.

590
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:26,180
l beg you, Alex, shouldn't
come near.

591
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:28,599
Now all my hair will fall out.

592
00:47:28,891 --> 00:47:31,393
l' m telling you, that Farouk
will be the death of us all.

593
00:47:31,518 --> 00:47:35,063
He won't kill us. -He will.
-No, he won't. -He will.

594
00:47:39,735 --> 00:47:41,737
Alexander, go to bed at once.
-Don't want to.

595
00:47:42,029 --> 00:47:44,656
Go to bed at once. -But l
don't want him to come here.

596
00:47:44,948 --> 00:47:46,742
You can't talk like that.
He is your cousin after all.

597
00:47:47,075 --> 00:47:49,036
So what. l don't need
him here.

598
00:47:52,623 --> 00:47:57,836
Hallo. Now what has
happened? -Ask him.

599
00:47:58,921 --> 00:48:00,631
He's shouting at me
about Arehla.

600
00:48:00,797 --> 00:48:02,758
What's with Arehla?
-She's invited him here.

601
00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:05,135
So what? On the vacation
you went there.

602
00:48:05,344 --> 00:48:07,846
But now it's not vacation,
l' m sick and don't feel good.

603
00:48:09,014 --> 00:48:11,308
Why do you need Arehla
here? -Don't you mix in now.

604
00:48:11,475 --> 00:48:12,476
Arehla hasn't
had chicken pox.

605
00:48:12,684 --> 00:48:14,686
Bluma wanted him to get it.

606
00:48:14,895 --> 00:48:17,606
Dr. Fried said it was good to
to get it when you' re young

607
00:48:17,773 --> 00:48:20,817
and avoid complications.
-Dad, l don't want him here.

608
00:48:21,109 --> 00:48:23,695
Tell him to go straight to bed.
-So, go to bed.

609
00:48:24,947 --> 00:48:26,281
So, go to bed.

610
00:48:30,327 --> 00:48:32,371
ls there anything to eat?
-So, sit down.

611
00:48:40,671 --> 00:48:42,798
Kova, there's someone
at the door. -l heard.

612
00:48:50,889 --> 00:48:56,395
Bluma! Arehla! Hallo.
How come it's so late?

613
00:48:57,104 --> 00:48:59,690
l was worried about you.
-Arehla was hungry.

614
00:48:59,815 --> 00:49:01,233
We had to stop and
get some food.

615
00:49:01,441 --> 00:49:03,944
All day Alex was saying:
Where's Arehla, where is he?

616
00:49:04,111 --> 00:49:05,112
Arehla!

617
00:49:07,072 --> 00:49:09,074
The boy looks good.
May he be protected.

618
00:49:09,241 --> 00:49:11,076
l brought some things
from the farm.

619
00:49:11,285 --> 00:49:12,786
Bluma, you really shouldn't.

620
00:49:12,911 --> 00:49:15,205
A thousand times l tell you,
we don't need anything.

621
00:49:15,372 --> 00:49:17,749
ls that all the eggs you
brought? Never mind.

622
00:49:18,208 --> 00:49:20,878
Alex, Arehla is here.
Come in Arehla.

623
00:49:21,086 --> 00:49:22,421
l don't understand.
l' m waiting...

624
00:49:26,091 --> 00:49:28,051
l was so worried,
l didn't understand.

625
00:49:30,345 --> 00:49:34,141
Open wide. -You've already
given me Cod-liver oil

626
00:49:34,349 --> 00:49:36,310
Only 2 more spoons. You
must get stronger.

627
00:49:36,476 --> 00:49:38,896
You can't lose weight
before you' re sick.

628
00:49:39,354 --> 00:49:44,985
One and ...two.

629
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:47,070
How can you swallow
that disgusting stuff?

630
00:49:47,279 --> 00:49:50,157
Don't be so clever.
lf you took Cod-liver oil

631
00:49:50,324 --> 00:49:52,409
then you wouldn't have
chicken pox. -Exactly.

632
00:49:52,576 --> 00:49:55,370
So why give to me if you want
me to get chicken pox.

633
00:49:55,662 --> 00:49:58,749
Don't you mix in.
Go to bed.

634
00:50:00,125 --> 00:50:02,002
But why do we have
to sleep in the same bed?

635
00:50:02,377 --> 00:50:03,587
Alexander, are you
starting again?

636
00:50:04,171 --> 00:50:05,964
Doctor Fried said you have
to sleep in the same bed.

637
00:50:06,173 --> 00:50:10,969
At least 3 days. -4 days.

638
00:50:18,727 --> 00:50:21,104
Heaven help us!

639
00:50:23,607 --> 00:50:24,691
What happened?

640
00:50:59,101 --> 00:51:02,521
Arehla, move over, you
pushed me out of the bed.

641
00:51:06,984 --> 00:51:09,987
Say, when do you eat breakfast?
-ln the morning!

642
00:51:10,153 --> 00:51:12,739
But l' m hungry now. -So go
to the kitchen and eat.

643
00:51:13,699 --> 00:51:15,409
Shall l make you a sandwich?

644
00:51:15,534 --> 00:51:18,704
Just let me sleep in peace.
-You sure. -Yes, go.

645
00:52:22,434 --> 00:52:26,230
l see that you also
cannot sleep.

646
00:52:26,396 --> 00:52:29,566
Tell me, can you give me
one sandwich.

647
00:52:31,151 --> 00:52:34,071
Help yourself.
-l like with tomato.

648
00:52:56,885 --> 00:53:02,558
lt's tasty! -Say, what's that
green stuff on your head?

649
00:53:02,766 --> 00:53:06,770
lt's hair cream. lt's the best
on the market today.

650
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:12,234
lt's made of Hammer fish
and Sword fish.

651
00:53:12,401 --> 00:53:17,573
You mix all up. You take
the juice of wild beast

652
00:53:17,823 --> 00:53:21,034
that cries at night
of full moon,

653
00:53:28,792 --> 00:53:32,254
the gall bladder juice.

654
00:53:32,963 --> 00:53:36,425
Disgusting! -Why you say
that? ln 2 days time

655
00:53:36,592 --> 00:53:40,095
l have long hair like
Samson and Delilah.

656
00:53:43,849 --> 00:53:48,437
Hey, can l have another
sandwich like that one.

657
00:53:48,687 --> 00:53:50,647
Sure, but the spread
is finished.

658
00:53:50,856 --> 00:53:54,359
Really? -Look,
the jar is empty.

659
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:05,954
God save us. ls that what
you gave me in the sandwich?

660
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:08,248
Yes. -That's my hair cream.

661
00:54:08,665 --> 00:54:12,586
My God. My stomach

662
00:54:14,463 --> 00:54:20,302
l've eaten a hammer and
a sword. No good.

663
00:54:20,594 --> 00:54:25,057
Now l' ll grow fins and scales.

664
00:54:25,307 --> 00:54:28,352
l must drink much soap
and wash all the cream out.

665
00:54:28,602 --> 00:54:31,146
What will become of me?
Who will help me?

666
00:54:31,438 --> 00:54:33,273
l think l will have tail.

667
00:54:34,024 --> 00:54:36,193
Hairs in my stomach and a tail

668
00:54:36,777 --> 00:54:39,154
What shall l do
Mrs Koprovsky?

669
00:54:57,172 --> 00:54:58,966
Up, up parasites.

670
00:55:05,013 --> 00:55:06,431
l' m all out of breath.

671
00:55:17,734 --> 00:55:19,444
Come quickly, the
teacher is going to kill us.

672
00:55:20,195 --> 00:55:22,239
Wait for me!
-Mimi wait a minute.

673
00:55:23,282 --> 00:55:25,784
There's a new movie with
Sandra day, " Summer Oasis"

674
00:55:26,118 --> 00:55:28,370
l saw that in the " Coming
Shortly" , with the blond guy.

675
00:55:28,745 --> 00:55:31,832
Troy Donaghu. -That's him.
Do you want to come?

676
00:55:32,749 --> 00:55:34,877
l can't, l' m going out
with my girlfriend.

677
00:55:35,085 --> 00:55:37,379
What are you doing Saturday?
Do you want to go to the sea?

678
00:55:37,713 --> 00:55:39,798
l' m going to my uncle's
with my parents.

679
00:55:40,632 --> 00:55:42,467
lt's a shame l' m not your
uncle. -What did you say?

680
00:55:43,385 --> 00:55:46,430

your uncle. -lt's a shame.

681
00:57:11,390 --> 00:57:12,724
Thank you, Mr. Aryeh.

682
00:57:13,934 --> 00:57:15,894
Lola, you really don't need
to hang up washing.

683
00:57:16,103 --> 00:57:18,772
l' ll do it later.
-Please, l want to do it.

684
00:57:19,273 --> 00:57:21,942
Hi. -Alex, will you help Lola
with the washing.

685
00:57:22,192 --> 00:57:23,610
Go up to the roof with her.

686
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:27,406
lt's really not necessary.
-l don't mind.

687
00:57:29,867 --> 00:57:30,742
Thank you.

688
00:57:41,086 --> 00:57:43,338
Dad said you hadn't heard
anything from Tadeck.

689
00:57:44,381 --> 00:57:48,677
No, they looked through
all sorts of documents,

690
00:57:48,886 --> 00:57:52,639
and they didn't find anything.
-You mustn't give up.

691
00:57:53,765 --> 00:57:55,934
Yesterday they put a noticei
in the paper, that l' m here.

692
00:57:56,852 --> 00:58:00,063
They also announced it on
the radio. Maybe he' ll hear it.

693
00:58:02,858 --> 00:58:06,403
l' m sure they' ll find him.
-l don't know any more.

694
00:58:07,613 --> 00:58:11,992
Maybe he was killed in the
war. -You mustn't think that.

695
00:58:12,826 --> 00:58:16,955
You must find him.
-Thank you.

696
00:58:19,625 --> 00:58:21,502
You' re a good boy Aletchko.

697
00:58:50,948 --> 00:58:53,200
Hi there! -What's up?
-Everything's OK.

698
00:58:53,367 --> 00:58:55,369
What are you going to do in
the vacation? -Don't know.

699
00:58:55,577 --> 00:58:57,496
Hey, do you like calypso?
-Sure.

700
00:58:57,704 --> 00:59:00,916
The Palm Tree Group is
coming to lsrael. -Really?

701
00:59:01,124 --> 00:59:03,794
They have a show at the
Amphi. l' m dying to see them.

702
00:59:03,919 --> 00:59:07,089
l bet there's no seats left.
-Can we finally take the shot?

703
00:59:07,339 --> 00:59:12,678
Alex, Mima not to disturb.
-Leonid!

00:59:40,247 --> 00:59:45,836
Alexander, what are you
looking for? -Cold water.

707
00:59:46,003 --> 00:59:48,547
Who drinks cold water in
summer? Have some tea.

708
00:59:48,839 --> 00:59:51,717
Not tea. l' m hot and sweaty.
-Exactly, that's why.

709
00:59:51,925 --> 00:59:55,554
You drink cold water,
you get a sore throat.

710
00:59:55,804 --> 00:59:57,264
Never mind.
-Where are you going?

711
00:59:57,556 --> 01:00:01,185
Cold Sabras. Cold Sabras.

712
01:00:06,523 --> 01:00:08,692
Two tickets for the group.
-60 grush.

713
01:00:08,859 --> 01:00:11,403
Anything cheaper? -That's
the cheapest. -OK.

714
01:00:40,974 --> 01:00:44,269
Hallo! -Hallo! ls Mimi at
home? -No, she's out.

715
01:00:45,103 --> 01:00:48,190
You sure? -Yes, did she
know you were coming?

716
01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:52,778
Not exctly. -l' m sorry.

717
01:00:53,153 --> 01:00:56,031
Shall l give her a message?
-No, it's not important.

718
01:00:56,990 --> 01:00:59,493
Well' goodbye. -Goodbye.

719
01:03:34,356 --> 01:03:37,943
Alex, did you see my brother
Shuky? Alex!

720
01:05:08,617 --> 01:05:10,327
Have you heard anything
about him?

721
01:05:15,874 --> 01:05:17,292
Lola, don't cry.

722
01:05:24,174 --> 01:05:26,093
Please, don't cry.

723
01:05:36,603 --> 01:05:41,400
You' re a good boy Aletchko.
-You' ll see, it will all be OK.

724
01:05:54,746 --> 01:05:55,998
Aletchko...

725
01:06:05,132 --> 01:06:06,592
My Aletchko...

726
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:27,696
Hallo, -Hallo.
-Do you live here? -Yes.

727
01:06:28,322 --> 01:06:30,741
Perhaps you know the
Koprovsky family?

728
01:06:30,908 --> 01:06:32,159
Yes, that's my family.

729
01:06:32,868 --> 01:06:36,622
Perhaps you can help me. l' m
looking for a girl called Lola.

730
01:06:38,248 --> 01:06:43,504
Lola? l don't know her. -Did
you have a family visitor?

731
01:06:44,004 --> 01:06:47,466
You' re mistaken.
-Are you sure?

732
01:06:49,426 --> 01:06:51,595
Maybe l' ll ask your parents.
lt's not worth trying.

733
01:06:51,845 --> 01:06:53,931
They've gone away,
they' re on holiday.

734
01:06:55,474 --> 01:07:00,854
Whatever the way, if you hear
from a girl called Lola

735
01:07:00,979 --> 01:07:03,982
would you give her this letter.

736
01:07:05,484 --> 01:07:09,821
Yes, thank you.

737
01:07:12,115 --> 01:07:16,411
Alexander, who were
you talking to? -No one.

738
01:07:16,828 --> 01:07:20,624
So go empty the pail and
wash it out in the yard.

739
01:07:28,382 --> 01:07:31,301
Good morning.
-Good morning.

740
01:07:34,179 --> 01:07:36,640
What's this?

For me? Thank you.
-lt's nothing.

742
01:08:45,542 --> 01:08:46,960
Enough Aletchko!

743
01:08:52,758 --> 01:08:53,759
Lola...

744
01:08:58,055 --> 01:09:02,851
l... -Aletchko...

745
01:09:06,313 --> 01:09:12,778
Mom must be worried about us.
Lola... -Lets go.

746
01:09:14,238 --> 01:09:16,615
Come on, lets go.

747
01:09:30,796 --> 01:09:34,341
Popsicle, lemon popsicles.

748
01:09:37,010 --> 01:09:41,515
l thought you were drowned.
-Lola, take a sandwich.

749
01:09:41,932 --> 01:09:46,353
So, how was the sea? -Good.
-Maybe some fried fish Alex?

750
01:09:46,645 --> 01:09:49,731
l hate fried fish! -So wear a
hat or you' ll get sun-stroke.

751
01:09:50,148 --> 01:09:52,526
Mom, enough. -Kova.
-Do as you' re told.

752
01:09:52,860 --> 01:09:54,236
Don't want to. Alexander!

753
01:10:04,997 --> 01:10:09,251
Hallo every one. -lt's
impossible to get rid of him.

754
01:10:11,128 --> 01:10:13,922
What made you come to the
sea? -Something important.

755
01:10:14,464 --> 01:10:15,716
What happened now?

756
01:10:18,468 --> 01:10:22,055
Miss Lola, this for you.
-For me? -Yes.

757
01:10:22,306 --> 01:10:25,142
What's this, a birthday?
-Much more important.

758
01:10:26,101 --> 01:10:30,898
Miss Lola, l've thought a lot.
l' m not married, nor are you.

759
01:10:31,023 --> 01:10:32,774
Farouk, stop talking rubbish.
She's not for you.

760
01:10:33,150 --> 01:10:37,029
Why not? l think she's for me
and l am for her.

761
01:10:37,279 --> 01:10:41,658
Miss Lola, l guarantee, there
is not another man like me.

762
01:10:41,909 --> 01:10:46,288
What do you say?

763
01:10:46,455 --> 01:10:47,748
You' re a real Don Juan.

764
01:10:49,875 --> 01:10:53,128
Tell me miss Lola,

765
01:10:53,420 --> 01:10:55,797

Farouk stop jabbering.
Before we make a wedding

01:10:58,634 --> 01:11:02,137
We have a Bar Mitzva.
-Mrs. Koprovsky,

Don't worry. l' ll be back.
-What about Tadeck?

01:15:11,345 --> 01:15:16,600
Perhaps he's in lsrael?
-No Alex, he's not here.

would you stay?

Lola, this is Sonia, my wife.

Sonia, Lola, a childhood
friend from before the war.

Pleased to meet you.

804
01:18:21,201 --> 01:18:23,328
Tadeck told me about you.

805
01:18:23,704 --> 01:18:25,080
And this is our daughter.

01:18:27,666 --> 01:18:32,254
Come in. Sit down.
l' ll make some tea.-Please.

807
01:18:38,177 --> 01:18:43,640
No thank you, l only came
to say hallo.

808
01:18:44,308 --> 01:18:46,560
l' m in a real hurry.

809
01:19:02,367 --> 01:19:04,995
We' re just suckers for not
bringing girls with us.

810
01:19:05,787 --> 01:19:08,165
We know your dogs
Yanosh. -Yes.

811
01:19:08,290 --> 01:19:10,042
Malcah and Zippy.

812
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:15,380
lt's a pity Fishenson didn't
bring his sister, Fritzy.

813
01:19:15,631 --> 01:19:19,259
Don't talk about my sister.
What about your aunt?

814
01:19:20,177 --> 01:19:22,221
She's better. -You know
at the Bar Mitzva

815
01:19:22,471 --> 01:19:24,598
l kissed her 7 times.

816
01:19:25,224 --> 01:19:28,602
So what, l kissed her 11
times with my tongue.

817
01:19:29,186 --> 01:19:30,896
She's crazy about me
the nymphomaniac.

818
01:19:31,271 --> 01:19:32,564
Shut your mouth idiot.

819
01:19:32,898 --> 01:19:34,233
But your mother
told my mother that

820
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:36,109
she has to leave tomorrow,
your aunt, lsn't that right?

821
01:19:36,568 --> 01:19:38,737
She was supposed to go
