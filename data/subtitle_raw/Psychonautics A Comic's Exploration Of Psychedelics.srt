I'm Shane Mauss, and I'm about
to do one of the world's most
powerful psychedelics.

3
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:14,726
[Shane] Two weeks ago
I made my first trip
to a psych ward, everybody.

4
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:18,252
-Hey. Yay!
-[audience clapping]

5
00:01:18,295 --> 00:01:19,731

6
00:01:19,775 --> 00:01:21,777
I, uh,

7
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,910
yeah, this is my first set,
uh, since that happened.

8
00:01:24,954 --> 00:01:26,390
I was there for seven days.

9
00:01:26,434 --> 00:01:30,133
It was just like a cute stop,
um, to a psyche ward.

10
00:01:30,177 --> 00:01:33,223
-[laughing]
-And, um, what happened was

11
00:01:33,267 --> 00:01:38,620
that I wanted to prove, uh,
that psychedelics are not
as scary as they seem.

12
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:42,493
-So I did all of them.
-[audience laughing]

13
00:01:42,537 --> 00:01:46,802
And so I just got out
of a psyche ward.

14

Um,

15
00:01:49,152 --> 00:01:50,371

16
00:01:51,546 --> 00:01:53,548
uh, yeah.

17
00:01:55,071 --> 00:01:56,638
What happened.

18
00:01:56,681 --> 00:01:59,945
I don't even like, uh, I don't
really know where to start.

19
00:01:59,989 --> 00:02:02,687
[off] I grew up in a small
wholesome suburb

20
00:02:02,731 --> 00:02:06,300
outside this little city called La Crosse, Wisconsin.

21
00:02:06,343 --> 00:02:12,523
And I had a very Leave It
To Beaver upbringing
that I never really fit into.

22
00:02:12,567 --> 00:02:16,614
I was always an awkward kid
and always had big dreams

23
00:02:16,658 --> 00:02:20,314
of one day becoming
a famous standup comedian.

24
00:02:20,357 --> 00:02:23,534
When I was young, I didn't
know that I was bipolar.

25
00:02:23,578 --> 00:02:25,580
I just knew that I was
constantly depressed,

26
00:02:25,623 --> 00:02:29,975
and the only thing that kept
me going were these
grandiose fantasies.

27
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:35,067
At 15, I started experimenting
with drugs, the same way
a lot of teenagers do,

28
00:02:35,111 --> 00:02:37,766
exceptionally irresponsibly.

29
00:02:37,809 --> 00:02:39,985
First of all, this was
the mid '90s.

30
00:02:40,029 --> 00:02:45,513
We weren't using scales
to measure a well-tested
recommended dose.

31
00:02:45,556 --> 00:02:48,037
We weren't testing
drugs for purity.

32
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,694
We just took the biggest
and therefore coolest
doses we could handle.

33
00:02:52,737 --> 00:02:56,219
Our best source was hopefully
a friend had a dirt bag uncle

34
00:02:56,263 --> 00:03:01,659
trying to make a few bucks selling teenagers some crap that he couldn't sell to his friends.

35
00:03:01,703 --> 00:03:04,880
We were just lucky
if someone's parents were
gone for the weekend.

36
00:03:04,923 --> 00:03:08,405
Otherwise, we were trespassing in some old abandoned building.

37
00:03:08,449 --> 00:03:12,975
We weren't doing them in a therapist's office or some spiritual ceremony

38
00:03:13,018 --> 00:03:16,326
that's been shaped
over thousands
of years of tradition.

39
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,762
There was no shamans.

40
00:03:17,806 --> 00:03:19,634
I was the closest
thing to a shaman.

41
00:03:19,677 --> 00:03:22,680
That's because I had a few
more trips than everybody else.

42
00:03:23,551 --> 00:03:28,251
In 2004, I moved from
Wisconsin to Boston to
start my comedy career.

43
00:03:28,295 --> 00:03:31,733
Actually, uh, I just
found out recently

44
00:03:32,647 --> 00:03:35,258
that when somebody
calls you a pussy

45
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:38,783
they mean that you're
weak or cowardly.

46
00:03:40,045 --> 00:03:44,311
All of my life, I thought
that people were calling me

47
00:03:45,268 --> 00:03:48,489
-the best thing ever.

48
00:03:50,752 --> 00:03:54,451
[off] I even started doing TV
appearances within three years

49
00:03:54,495 --> 00:03:57,585
and my career was off
and running after that.

50
00:03:57,628 --> 00:03:59,891
Please welcome the very
funny, Shane Mauss.

51
00:03:59,935 --> 00:04:05,854
[Zach] I've known Shane since
about 2006 when I started doing
comedy in the Boston scene.

52
00:04:05,897 --> 00:04:09,510
Shane was several steps ahead
of me in comedy at the time.

53
00:04:09,553 --> 00:04:12,730
And I was having a good
set and I looked over
and I saw Shane

54
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:16,212
kind of smiling at me
while I was performing.

55
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:20,390
And it was like seeing one
of your heroes approving
of what you were doing.

56
00:04:20,434 --> 00:04:22,305
And I remember early on
that was a really cool,

57
00:04:22,349 --> 00:04:25,569
"Oh I'm meeting the big guys in
the scene" kind of experience.

58
00:04:25,613 --> 00:04:32,489
He does a good job of being
able to sneak science and
facts into jokes to people.

59
00:04:32,533 --> 00:04:34,056
They're kind of
like joke bombs.

60
00:04:34,099 --> 00:04:36,580
Or people would be laughing
because it's very relatable,

61
00:04:36,624 --> 00:04:38,756
but at the same time, it's like,
"Oh, I'm laughing.

62
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,845
Oh, shit, he made
me learn something."

63
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:44,632
He's, uh, he's so quick and,
and loose and fuckin' fun.

64
00:04:44,675 --> 00:04:46,547
Uh, I-I think he's the best.

65
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:50,115
I met Shane about a year
and a half ago, I would say.
He's a smart guy.

66
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:52,248
I think it's cool that he
does a science podcast.

67
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:56,165
Uh, I met Shane doing comedy
in Austin, Texas.

68
00:04:56,208 --> 00:05:01,039
He's done theme shows,
like he did a whole CD about
when he broke both his feet,

69
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,303
it was called, "My Big Break".

70
00:05:03,346 --> 00:05:06,393
And I think before that he had
the one about animals fuckin'
or somethin' like that.

71
00:05:06,436 --> 00:05:09,570
And to have, no pun
intended, evolved yet again

72
00:05:09,613 --> 00:05:12,268
into the material about
psychedelics that
he's doing right now,

73
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:15,793
it's all of a piece, but I think
not every comic's career

74
00:05:15,837 --> 00:05:19,275
is so obviously segmented
into these different phases.

75
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,669
Yeah, the reason
I called him, uh, Dr. Drugs

76
00:05:21,712 --> 00:05:24,759
is he's a guy that
explains drugs too much.

77
00:05:24,802 --> 00:05:27,283
[Ramin] I like his,
uh, curiosity.

78
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:32,332
He's always asking questions,
he's always trying to put
together the whole picture.

79
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:35,378
I mean he does get a little
trippy, but it's not like

80
00:05:35,422 --> 00:05:39,077
talking to somebody,
you know, that's a real
crunchy hippie or some shit.

81
00:05:39,121 --> 00:05:42,820
I would say that Shane is
fearless, he's a wild man.

82
00:05:42,864 --> 00:05:48,173
He's kind of taking it for the
team, for the rest of us
as the shaman guinea pig.

reset my body and my mind.

I didn't exercise.

It improves the cohesion

If you have a little
more acuity and a little

like most things that
are important in our world,
we haven't the faintest idea.

134

But what if you have to think
about it, if you're taking
something into your body

there's a kind of myth that
psychedelics go to your brain.

Now in reality, anything
you put in your body goes
into your bloodstream

cell of the body.

138
00:08:59,321 --> 00:09:03,717

and psychology

00:10:26,408 --> 00:10:33,110
It opened these doors to all
these new interests in science
and how the mind works.

162
00:10:33,154 --> 00:10:35,243
Mushrooms gave me empathy.

163
00:10:35,286 --> 00:10:40,378
They gave me a sense
of wonder and appreciation
for the beauty of nature.

164
00:10:40,422 --> 00:10:46,907
I never cared about nice
scenic views and sunsets
before mushrooms.

165
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:51,259
After mushrooms, I was
like, "Oh, I get it now.

166
00:10:51,302 --> 00:10:54,392
That's why people like trees."

167
00:10:55,524 --> 00:11:00,660
My belief is that these, um,
experiences of psilocybin,

168
00:11:00,703 --> 00:11:03,750
it's kind of like the key
that opens your mind

169
00:11:03,793 --> 00:11:09,799
to allow access to this true
nature, um, this authentic self.

170
00:11:09,843 --> 00:11:15,500
And I believe that is love,
that connection and
the-this connection

171
00:11:15,544 --> 00:11:19,287
and it's what connects us
to ourselves, to each other
and to everything.

172
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:24,771
[Shane] Here we are in Kentucky,
home of the Kentucky
Derby, bourbon,

173
00:11:24,814 --> 00:11:27,077
and hopefully some mushrooms.

174
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:31,865
Eric Osborne normally leads
psilocybin retreats in Jamaica

175
00:11:31,908 --> 00:11:34,998
where you can do psilocybin
mushrooms legally.

176
00:11:35,042 --> 00:11:37,392
You're welcome
for that knowledge.

177
00:11:37,435 --> 00:11:42,919
And today, he's going to be
showing us how to identify, harvest and pick wild mushrooms.

178
00:11:42,963 --> 00:11:44,225
Where are we right now?

179
00:11:44,268 --> 00:11:46,575
Uh, just a random
park in the city.

180
00:11:46,618 --> 00:11:50,361
Yeah, there's like children's
birthday parties and people
walking their dogs.

181
00:11:50,405 --> 00:11:51,928
How'd you get into doing this?

182
00:11:54,191 --> 00:11:58,543
Uh, somebody gave me a bag
of mushrooms when I was 20 and
that changed my life forever.

183
00:11:58,587 --> 00:12:01,938
Uh, but no, I mean I-I started
picking wild mushrooms for food.

184
00:12:01,982 --> 00:12:05,420
Uh, it was after
I had psychoactive
mushrooms, uh, I-I

185
00:12:06,421 --> 00:12:10,512
kind of fell in love with
psilocybin, uh, immediately.

186
00:12:10,555 --> 00:12:13,907
Like, when I had that first
like swoosh of shadows

187
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,605
and ah-ha, oh this is,
this is what I want.

188
00:12:16,648 --> 00:12:22,132
Um, and then that just
like led to a general
intrigue about fungus,

189
00:12:22,176 --> 00:12:25,309
uh, and watching animals
eat mushrooms in the wild

190
00:12:25,353 --> 00:12:28,965
and just got curious of how many
edibles there were out there.

191
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:33,100
And then learned that I could
clone and grow my own mushrooms.

192
00:12:33,143 --> 00:12:36,930
It satisfied the-the
nerd part of myself.

193
00:12:36,973 --> 00:12:39,976
If we're looking for
psychoactives then we're not
going to be looking in dung;

194
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,761
we're going to be
looking in mulch.

195
00:12:41,804 --> 00:12:44,938
Vast majority of the
psychoactive mushrooms
grow in wood debris.

196
00:12:44,981 --> 00:12:48,811
There are a few species
that do grow in dung,
but not majorly.

197
00:12:48,855 --> 00:12:51,858
What I thought I liked
about them was that
they taste like shit,

198
00:12:51,901 --> 00:12:55,252
and now I feel like
they're just tasting like
wood chips, but I guess...

199
00:12:55,296 --> 00:12:57,559
Uh, well these taste different
than your cubensis.

200
00:12:57,602 --> 00:12:59,604
Right? Cubensis is the one that
most people are familiar with,

201
00:12:59,648 --> 00:13:02,433
are definitely a dung
dwelling mushroom.
That's where they originated.

202
00:13:02,477 --> 00:13:06,698
They don't have to grow in dung;
you can grow them in like straw
or paper, all kinds of stuff.

203
00:13:06,742 --> 00:13:08,526
-But, but...
-But you get to.

204
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:09,789
You can indeed, yes.

205
00:13:09,832 --> 00:13:11,355
-You certainly can
grow them in dung.
-Yes.

206
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:13,836
Uh, people are very reluctant
to pick mushrooms

207
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,231
because there are obviously some
very toxic species out there.

208
00:13:17,274 --> 00:13:22,105
And the psychoactive mushrooms
that we're looking for today
were only identified in 2003.

209
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:26,762
So it's relatively new, uh,
even to regular pickers.

210
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:30,897
I've been looking for psilocybin
for like 15 years in the wild

211
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:34,378
and only last year
I finally found it.

212
00:13:34,422 --> 00:13:40,341
They kind of run in veins along
the mycelium so here's some
real young ones there.

213
00:13:40,384 --> 00:13:43,170
[Shane] Ah, look at that.
It's beautiful.

214
00:13:47,304 --> 00:13:52,875
We are quite literally
three feet from the road

215
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:57,140
and there's families and stuff
just driving right by the truth,

216
00:13:57,184 --> 00:14:01,928
and uh, if only-if
only they knew.

217
00:14:01,971 --> 00:14:08,108
Um, just what I'm looking
at here is, looks like it would
be a few hundred dollars'

218
00:14:08,151 --> 00:14:11,633
worth of mushrooms
that I've seen just sitting
in this one place.

219
00:14:11,676 --> 00:14:14,244
There's definitely a few
hundred trips right
here where we're sitting.

220
00:14:14,288 --> 00:14:17,726
If you were to eat this,
this, this, this, and this,

221
00:14:17,769 --> 00:14:20,816
you're gonna be solid
for several hours.

222
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:25,038
So how long does it take for one
of these little babies to turn
into one of these big fellas?

223
00:14:25,081 --> 00:14:26,866
Uh, about three to five days.

224
00:14:27,736 --> 00:14:29,564
So how often do you come here?

225
00:14:29,607 --> 00:14:33,394
-
-About every three to five days.
-[laughing]

226
00:14:34,699 --> 00:14:38,660
Just every single time
there's mushrooms to be
picked you will be here.

227
00:14:38,703 --> 00:14:40,009
Uh, yeah.

228
00:14:40,053 --> 00:14:42,185
-Of course.
-I make my rounds, yeah.

229
00:14:42,229 --> 00:14:45,580
Tell me about this mulch.
What's, uh, what's it doing
here in the first place?

230
00:14:45,623 --> 00:14:49,105
Oh, yeah, so the mulch
is courtesy of the city
park system.

231
00:14:49,149 --> 00:14:53,762
So interesting to note that
the municipal parks are the,
uh, largest cultivator

232
00:14:53,805 --> 00:14:58,506
of psilocybin mushrooms
definitely in this city
and probably nationwide.

233
00:14:58,549 --> 00:15:00,290
♪♪♪

234
00:15:04,381 --> 00:15:06,383
[laughing]

235
00:15:48,034 --> 00:15:52,386
My mom was always telling me
that I should go and play
outside when I was younger

236
00:15:52,429 --> 00:15:54,997
-and I would have been
more inclined to do that...
-Yeah.

237
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:57,565
...had I known that this
was going to be the case.

238
00:15:57,608 --> 00:16:00,524
This is better than picking
apples, that's for sure.

239
00:16:00,568 --> 00:16:06,313
This is actually, this is one
of the best first dates that
I've been on in some time.

240
00:16:07,444 --> 00:16:10,317
How many trips am I holding
in my hand right now?

241
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,492
Seven.

242
00:16:11,535 --> 00:16:13,537
-Seven?
-About five to seven.

243
00:16:13,581 --> 00:16:16,279
-Oh.
-Maybe more, depending on,
depending how, uh...

244
00:16:16,323 --> 00:16:17,889
-Yeah.
-...how strong
you like your trip.

245
00:16:17,933 --> 00:16:20,022
Yeah, it's two
Shane trips worth.

246
00:16:20,066 --> 00:16:21,719
So what's the next step?

247
00:16:21,763 --> 00:16:24,200
Find a safe place to eat them.

248
00:16:24,244 --> 00:16:30,076
The first lesson about setting
setting, do not do it in an
inappropriate setting. You know?

249
00:16:30,119 --> 00:16:34,471
I mean if you're out
there with saber-toothed tigers
stay off the stuff or, you know,

250
00:16:34,515 --> 00:16:39,041
if you're on the freeway at 80
miles an hour it's probably not
the place you'll want to do it.

251
00:16:39,085 --> 00:16:42,044
I mean there's no overestimating
the stupidity of people

252
00:16:42,088 --> 00:16:45,961
and that they're very
ingenious at finding
inappropriate settings.

253
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:52,576
But the point is why,
it diminishes its value if it
may be dangerous? You know.

254
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:57,929
Ninety, 95 percent of bad trip
stories I hear is that someone,

255
00:16:57,973 --> 00:17:02,847
"Oh, I did them once in college,
uh, I had some mushrooms, went
to a kegger, oh it was awful."

256
00:17:02,891 --> 00:17:05,067
[audience laughing]

257
00:17:05,111 --> 00:17:07,417
-Oh yeah, it was.
-[audience laughing]

258
00:17:08,766 --> 00:17:09,898
Yep.

259
00:17:11,247 --> 00:17:13,249
Pretty sure I know where
you went wrong there.

260
00:17:14,729 --> 00:17:17,645
-Keggers are awful.
-[audience laughing]

261
00:17:18,646 --> 00:17:20,430
They are an awful, awful time.

262
00:17:22,867 --> 00:17:25,174
Mushrooms tried
to show you that.

263
00:17:25,218 --> 00:17:26,871
[audience laughing
and clapping]

264
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:33,443
People used to do yoga and
self-flagellation and torture

265
00:17:33,487 --> 00:17:37,317
and all of these things
for sometimes a lifetime

266
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,973
and in hopes that they
would get one of these
meaningful experiences.

267
00:17:42,017 --> 00:17:43,758
If they were lucky, they did.

268
00:17:43,801 --> 00:17:48,676
Well, now, 30 milligrams
of psilocybin in the right
circumstances

269
00:17:48,719 --> 00:17:51,418
and with the right people
looking after you,

270
00:17:51,461 --> 00:17:56,814
pretty much any schmuck
can have a mystical experience.
You don't have to be a saint.

271
00:17:56,858 --> 00:17:59,339
It's just built into
your neural chemistry.

272
00:18:00,209 --> 00:18:02,385
Starting to get gaggy yet?

273
00:18:02,429 --> 00:18:04,953
-Well, that's why I want
to just mow 'em down.
-Oh.

274
00:18:04,996 --> 00:18:05,823
Fuck it.

275
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:13,004
-When is it gonna be done?
-Done. I don't like
thinking about it.

276
00:18:13,048 --> 00:18:18,532
We've come to believe that
the wise responsible use of
drugs like psilocybin

277
00:18:18,575 --> 00:18:22,144
constitute a major
frontier in psychiatry,

278
00:18:22,188 --> 00:18:28,759
can be incredibly effective
in helping people, uh,
deal with depression, anxiety,

279
00:18:28,803 --> 00:18:32,154
addictions, simply
to live more fully.

280
00:18:32,198 --> 00:18:36,376
And the interesting thing
with these drugs, you don't
have to keep taking them.

281
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:42,425
What's helpful is the memory
often of a single experience,

282
00:18:42,469 --> 00:18:50,694
so it's the experience that is
helpful versus the biochemical
effect of the medication.

283
00:18:51,652 --> 00:18:54,829
Even people that have
done psychedelics, people
that are interested,

284
00:18:54,872 --> 00:19:00,443
open minded about
it, be like, "But what if you
stay like that forever?

285
00:19:00,487 --> 00:19:07,189
Oh, that mythical perma trip.
What if you stay
like that forever?"

286
00:19:07,233 --> 00:19:09,104
Which is not how drugs work.

287
00:19:10,192 --> 00:19:13,326
Let's, I mean you can have
experiences that can
change you certainly

288
00:19:13,369 --> 00:19:15,806
because every experience
in life changes you
in way or another.

289
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:19,201
But you can't just magically
have psilocybin chemicals

290
00:19:19,245 --> 00:19:21,986
floating around in
your brain forever.

291
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,553
I don't know why
people think that.

292
00:19:23,597 --> 00:19:25,425
You never see anyone have a
bunch of drinks and be like,

293
00:19:25,468 --> 00:19:29,211
-"Oh, what if I'm just stuck
like this now? Huh?"
-[audience laughing]

294
00:19:30,908 --> 00:19:33,172
"Guess I'm never
wearing pants again."

295
00:19:35,522 --> 00:19:37,219
That's not how drugs work.

296
00:19:37,263 --> 00:19:41,919
I've had some terrifying
experiences on psychedelics,

297
00:19:41,963 --> 00:19:45,706
um, where I experienced
things that I can't explain

298
00:19:45,749 --> 00:19:50,537
and don't really like to talk
about that much 'cause they
were so scary and powerful.

299
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:54,062
And, uh, I, you know,
it's like I don't regret
having those experiences,

300
00:19:54,105 --> 00:19:56,151
having come through them.

301
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:59,589
Certainly while I was having
them I thought boy I'll
be glad when this is over.

302
00:19:59,633 --> 00:20:02,331
I need to remind myself
that it is going to be
over at some point.

303
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:04,551
This isn't just it forever.

304
00:20:04,594 --> 00:20:10,600
So I think being scared and
being unsettled and experiencing
the negative emotions

305
00:20:10,644 --> 00:20:13,560
that can be associated with that
are definitely one risk

306
00:20:13,603 --> 00:20:16,258
that you run by messing
around with this stuff.

307
00:20:16,302 --> 00:20:19,435
Maybe for people
who have existing
psychological conditions

308
00:20:19,479 --> 00:20:22,264
or are just more prone to being
sensitive to this kind of thing,

309
00:20:22,308 --> 00:20:25,224
it can be even more severe
than it has been for me.

310
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:27,226
When you totally
shatter your brain

311
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:31,578
and your personality
comes apart and your
ego is dissolved,

312
00:20:31,621 --> 00:20:37,279
and you know, you're on the
cosmos somewhere and, but when
you start to come back together

313
00:20:37,323 --> 00:20:40,108
it's kind of like rebooting
your hard drive.

314
00:20:40,151 --> 00:20:42,458
It's like defragging
your hard drive.

315
00:20:42,502 --> 00:20:49,291
When you-when it falls back
together you leave behind a lot

00:30:49,935 --> 00:30:53,547
that it pretends
it's preventing, because
it sends the message

473
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:57,899
to young people these drugs only
have risks, there's no benefits.

474
00:30:57,943 --> 00:31:03,078
If you use them you must
be a hedonist, uh,
you-- you're immoral.

475
00:31:03,122 --> 00:31:09,084
And that colors the perception
that young people have
about these substances

476
00:31:09,128 --> 00:31:13,915
and they enter
into a relationship with
them that's unhealthy.

477
00:31:13,959 --> 00:31:17,049
They think this is a rebellious
thing; I'm being bad.

478
00:31:17,092 --> 00:31:19,921
And consequently,
they use too much.

479
00:31:19,965 --> 00:31:22,228
They don't-- they aren't
moderate in their use.

480
00:31:22,271 --> 00:31:27,581
We don't model healthy
psychedelic use for young people

481
00:31:27,624 --> 00:31:30,540
in the way that we
do with alcohol.

482
00:31:30,584 --> 00:31:35,023
You know, we have a glass
of wine with our kids when
they get to be teenagers

483
00:31:35,067 --> 00:31:38,461
and they, you know, so that they
don't binge drink later on

484
00:31:38,505 --> 00:31:42,901
and we show them how these, how
alcohol can be used responsibly.

485
00:31:42,944 --> 00:31:45,555
We need to do the same
thing with psychedelics.

486
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:50,517
So there's no drug market
more highly adulterated
than the MDMA market.

487
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,562
But adulterant isn't
really the right word.

488
00:31:52,606 --> 00:31:56,001
What's happening is that
other drugs are being
substituted for MDMA

489
00:31:56,044 --> 00:32:00,919
because the precursors
to make MDMA are expensive
or risky to obtain.

490
00:32:00,962 --> 00:32:04,357
So instead of producing MDMA,

491
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:08,013
criminals are producing
paramethoxyamphetamine,

492
00:32:08,056 --> 00:32:12,234
um, all these bath salts now,
a class of drugs
called cathinone's,

493
00:32:12,278 --> 00:32:15,629
uh, pressing them into tablets
and selling them as Ecstasy

494
00:32:15,672 --> 00:32:19,720
or selling them as Molly
and young people think
they're getting MDMA.

495
00:32:21,417 --> 00:32:24,899
[Shane] My friend, comedian
Bert Kreischer, knows a thing
or two about partying.

496
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:29,512
In fact, in 1997, Rolling Stone
called him the number
one partier

497
00:32:29,556 --> 00:32:31,993
at the number one party school.

498
00:32:33,168 --> 00:32:35,083
That is real.

499
00:32:35,127 --> 00:32:37,477
My wife's a redneck.
She's like, "Oh, we'll just
be honest with them."

500
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,261
We're talking about
raising the girls.

501
00:32:39,305 --> 00:32:42,308
I was like, "I can't do that,
I've partied too much."

502
00:32:42,351 --> 00:32:45,702
Like what would-- what would
I say to them when they go,
"What about drugs, Dad?"

503
00:32:45,746 --> 00:32:49,271
"Oh just take half."
Like it just doesn't
make fuckin' sense.

504
00:32:49,315 --> 00:32:50,925
Like...

505
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:55,234
Yeah, but I mean you, didn't you
nearly get raped by a bear once?

506
00:32:55,277 --> 00:32:57,236
Yeah.

507
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,978
So I mean I'm not sure
you need to be that concerned
about your daughters

508
00:33:00,021 --> 00:33:02,893
trying to follow in
your-- in your footsteps.

509
00:33:02,937 --> 00:33:05,984
-I have a big--I have a--
-As lo-as long as you share
those stories as well.

510
00:33:06,027 --> 00:33:08,029
I have a long stride.
I have a long stride.

511
00:33:08,073 --> 00:33:11,554
But if they have to do
hallucinates I--I hope they
do them in light doses...

512
00:33:11,598 --> 00:33:13,817
-Yeah.
-...and-- and enjoy them.

513
00:33:13,861 --> 00:33:18,300
You know? And have some really
spiritual experiences on a
mountain top in the Southwest

514
00:33:18,344 --> 00:33:21,869
and look at watermelon sunsets
and see the world differently.

515
00:33:21,912 --> 00:33:30,530
Me and my girlfriend eat MDMA
all the time, and it brings us
so much closer together.

516
00:33:30,573 --> 00:33:34,969
We forgive each other
for any of our fucking
bullshit that we have,

517
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:38,059
or we get it all out
and in a loving we--way

518
00:33:38,103 --> 00:33:40,496
we share shit we never
thought we'd be sharing
with one another.

519
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:42,498
We could have used Molly
on this bike ride today.

520
00:33:44,109 --> 00:33:46,024
Ecstasy is pretty cool.

521
00:33:47,068 --> 00:33:49,766
Ecstasy is awesome.

522
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:53,988
One of the amazing things
about MDMA is that it actually

523
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:57,296
decreases the activity
of the amygdala, so,

524
00:33:57,339 --> 00:34:00,690
and subjectively
patients report,

525
00:34:00,734 --> 00:34:04,564
like it-- it being easier to
access difficult memories

526
00:34:04,607 --> 00:34:07,219
and easier to talk about
difficult things

527
00:34:07,262 --> 00:34:11,484
that the amygdala
would normally inhibit them
from being comfortable

528
00:34:11,527 --> 00:34:14,226
or able even to talk about.

529
00:34:14,269 --> 00:34:17,968
[Shane] There are twenty-four
million Americans with
posttraumatic stress disorder.

530
00:34:18,012 --> 00:34:19,057
[dog barking]

531
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:19,970
My friend, Heather,
is one of them.

532
00:34:20,014 --> 00:34:21,711
Hey! How are you?

533
00:34:22,625 --> 00:34:27,195
[Heather] In my experience with
PTSD, sex, trauma, depression,

534
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:31,808
it's the Bermuda Triangle
of my experience.

535
00:34:31,852 --> 00:34:35,160
One thing leads to the other,
leads to the other,
leads to the other.

536
00:34:35,203 --> 00:34:40,861
What the MDMA allows
is for a connection,

537
00:34:40,904 --> 00:34:46,823
uh, an openness that
may not even be achievable
in regular therapy,

538
00:34:46,867 --> 00:34:49,870
and if it is it requires
building so much trust.

539
00:34:49,913 --> 00:34:53,526
It's like, you know, you're
talking about months of therapy

540
00:34:53,569 --> 00:34:58,183
just building the trust
so somebody can talk about
such a horrible thing.

541
00:34:58,226 --> 00:35:02,361
[Marcela] Trauma is housed in
the body and the body remembers.

542
00:35:02,404 --> 00:35:08,367
In 1984, I had MDMA
to treat PTSD.

543
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:12,458
And, um, it was very successful
and it was wonderful,

544
00:35:12,501 --> 00:35:15,330
um, and it was
an amazing experience.

545
00:35:15,374 --> 00:35:16,636
Saved my life.

546
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:22,946
So I embarked in, um,
wanting to help others.

547
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:27,168
There's only two drugs that
are approved by the FDA for
posttraumatic stress disorder.

548
00:35:27,212 --> 00:35:30,215
Both of them are SSRI's:
Zoloft and Paxil.

549
00:35:30,258 --> 00:35:33,174
They tend to just
have a mild effect.

550
00:35:33,218 --> 00:35:37,874
They just reduce symptoms,
but they leave most
people still with PTSD.

551
00:35:37,918 --> 00:35:43,141
MAPS, uh, stands for the
Multidisciplinary Association
for Psychedelic Studies.

552
00:35:43,184 --> 00:35:48,058
The essence of what we do is,
um, FDA-approved research

553
00:35:48,102 --> 00:35:51,105
trying to make psychedelics
and marijuana into prescription
medicines.

554
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:55,153
MAPS, uh, has, you know,
funded the studies

555
00:35:55,196 --> 00:36:01,376
to actually go through the full
FDA approval process that a
normal psychiatric drug would.

556
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:04,727
People, uh, in the studies
have a really difficult time.

557
00:36:04,771 --> 00:36:09,558
It's not an easy process,
mostly because they have to be
off all their medications.

558
00:36:09,602 --> 00:36:14,563
And some of them, we--
we had people that took ten
medications,

559
00:36:14,607 --> 00:36:17,087
ten different medications,
twelve different medications,

560
00:36:17,131 --> 00:36:20,090
and have been taking
medications for twenty years.

561
00:36:20,134 --> 00:36:24,051
So getting off of all those
medications was
already a challenge

562
00:36:24,094 --> 00:36:26,575
and a difficult, uh,
thing for them to do.

563
00:36:28,273 --> 00:36:32,190
My experience with the MDMA
and working with this therapist,

564
00:36:34,148 --> 00:36:39,109
it was like going to five
hundred years of therapy
in five or six hours.

565
00:36:39,153 --> 00:36:42,112
Lifetime of therapy
in five hours.

566
00:36:42,156 --> 00:36:45,464
And the reintegration process
with the MDMA,

567
00:36:47,074 --> 00:36:49,685
after the MDMA, [inhaling]

568
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:52,427
it changed my whole entire life.

569
00:36:52,471 --> 00:36:57,345
You know, I am no longer
in profound pain

570
00:36:57,389 --> 00:37:01,393
on a continual daily basis.

571
00:37:02,785 --> 00:37:08,530
People with PTSD spend
a lot of- most of their time
warding off the feeling,

572
00:37:08,574 --> 00:37:10,967
warding off the trauma
so that it doesn't come up.

573
00:37:11,011 --> 00:37:13,448
We don't want to, you know,
manage your symptoms;

574
00:37:13,492 --> 00:37:18,148
we want you to go into your
symptoms and into the feelings
and into what happened

575
00:37:18,192 --> 00:37:23,632
and in a safe place with the
help of MDMA as a resource.

576
00:37:23,676 --> 00:37:27,941
The way in which psychedelic
assisted psychotherapy is going
to be approved by the FDA

577
00:37:27,984 --> 00:37:32,685
is with a set of special
regulations that require that
the people that prescribe it,

578
00:37:32,728 --> 00:37:36,036
that are with people, have had
training in how to use the drug,

579
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:43,652
and that the administration
of these drugs will only be in
these licensed clinic settings.

580
00:37:43,696 --> 00:37:46,264
Our treatment is two
or three MDMA sessions

581
00:37:46,307 --> 00:37:48,962
and then three integrated
psychotherapy sessions

582
00:37:49,005 --> 00:37:51,181
of ninety minutes
after each MDMA session,

583
00:37:51,225 --> 00:37:54,446
and then each MDMA session
is three to five weeks apart.

584
00:37:54,489 --> 00:37:58,101
And so we have now treated
a hundred and seven
people in that way.

585
00:37:58,145 --> 00:38:02,105
And one year after the last
MDMA session,

586
00:38:02,149 --> 00:38:05,848
so this is not just looking at
short-term effects, but long-
term effects.

587
00:38:05,892 --> 00:38:12,681
Two thirds of the people
who had treatment-
resistant chronic PTSD,

588
00:38:12,725 --> 00:38:15,075
um, no longer had PTSD.

589
00:38:15,118 --> 00:38:19,427
The tragedy of this field is,
uh, that we're seeing
with these studies now,

590
00:38:19,471 --> 00:38:22,038
the power that these drugs
potentially have.

591
00:38:22,082 --> 00:38:24,302
And the early psychiatrists,
they said that.

592
00:38:28,131 --> 00:38:31,091
[man] LSD was isolated
by a Stolen Hofmann

593
00:38:31,134 --> 00:38:34,312
in a Sandoz Pharmaceutical
Company of Basel, Switzerland.

594
00:38:34,355 --> 00:38:37,576
[Erika] There was a lot
of promising research
that unfolded in the 1950's

595
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:42,624
and by 1961, there were
over a thousand published
articles using LSD.

596
00:38:42,668 --> 00:38:46,541
The idea of treating people
for alcoholism with LSD

597
00:38:46,585 --> 00:38:49,762
came about when they
watched people going
through delirium tremens,

598
00:38:49,805 --> 00:38:52,634
and they watched the pain
and suffering that
people experienced

599
00:38:52,678 --> 00:38:54,680
when they hit rock bottom.

600
00:38:54,723 --> 00:38:58,379
And they thought it was
possible that perhaps you could
hijack that experience

601
00:38:58,423 --> 00:39:02,688
by giving people LSD
before they physiologically
reach rock bottom.

602
00:39:02,731 --> 00:39:06,561
And they thought this would
work by kind of scaring people
that they would, you know,

603
00:39:06,605 --> 00:39:09,651
subjects would have a very
terrible experience and
it would frighten them

604
00:39:09,695 --> 00:39:12,088
and they would seek
help as a result.

605
00:39:12,132 --> 00:39:14,003
But it didn't really
work out that way.

606
00:39:14,047 --> 00:39:17,267
What happened was
alcoholic patients would
come through this treatment

607
00:39:17,311 --> 00:39:19,444
and they actually had
very reflective experiences.

608
00:39:19,487 --> 00:39:23,839
Some of them were quite
beautiful, many of them were
overwhelmingly spiritual.

609
00:39:23,883 --> 00:39:27,800
I've never seen this
intimate beauty in my life.

610
00:39:27,843 --> 00:39:28,714
It's like a--

611
00:39:30,193 --> 00:39:32,674
a curtain or a spider web.

612
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:38,811
Can you see it? It's right
here in front of me. Right now.

613
00:39:38,854 --> 00:39:40,334
Watch.

614
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:41,248
No.

615
00:39:42,597 --> 00:39:44,077
Good heavens.

616
00:39:47,123 --> 00:39:48,734
You know, it went through me?

617
00:39:50,779 --> 00:39:52,825
It passed right through me!

618
00:39:52,868 --> 00:39:54,957
[Erika] And so we know
that Bill Wilson, or Bill W.,

619
00:39:55,001 --> 00:39:57,351
one of the cofounders
of Alcoholics Anonymous,

620
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:02,269
sought out psychedelic
researchers in-- in the United
States and also came to Canada

621
00:40:02,312 --> 00:40:06,012
in search of this mechanism
to determine whether or not
there was a way

622
00:40:06,055 --> 00:40:11,060
to get more people into
Alcoholics Anonymous by having
an LSD treatment initially.

623
00:40:11,104 --> 00:40:14,063
One of the things that
Alcoholics Anonymous
offered to people

624
00:40:14,107 --> 00:40:16,762
that wasn't necessarily
offered in a hospital setting

625
00:40:16,805 --> 00:40:20,896
was step two, which
was recognizing that
there was a God.

626
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:25,161
And for many of the alcoholics
who were asked to come in and
talk about their feelings

627
00:40:25,205 --> 00:40:29,209
or accept that there is a God,
uh, this wasn't really something
that they were paired--

628
00:40:29,252 --> 00:40:31,516
prepared to do.

629
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:34,910
As one of the subjects told me,
you know, "I wanted to get drunk
and I wanted to, you know,

630
00:40:34,954 --> 00:40:36,999
hit on women and
I wanted to fight guys.

631
00:40:37,043 --> 00:40:41,090
I didn't want to sit around
talking about my feelings
and thinking about God."

632
00:40:41,134 --> 00:40:46,356
He said, "But after I took
LSD, I saw God and
I was prepared to come in

633
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,359
and listen to other people
uh, talk about their feelings.

634
00:40:49,403 --> 00:40:53,059
And I appreciated
and understood why I needed
that context to get there.

635
00:40:53,102 --> 00:40:57,063
And within a few years, people
being treated with psychedelic
therapy for alcoholism

636
00:40:57,106 --> 00:41:00,283
were claiming, um, success
rates of, in some units,

637
00:41:00,327 --> 00:41:03,678
up to ninety percent success
rate with a two year follow-up.

638
00:41:03,722 --> 00:41:05,550
And that's with
complete abstinence.

639
00:41:05,593 --> 00:41:09,510
No research units had
ever claimed any kind
of success at that level

640
00:41:09,554 --> 00:41:11,817
for any alcoholism treatment.

641
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:15,995
For a lot of people, it's just
becoming this miracle drug
and the cutting edge of science

642
00:41:16,038 --> 00:41:20,521
and psychologists
and therapists were rushing
into this new field.

643
00:41:20,565 --> 00:41:23,002
Then the U.S. found out
about it and they're like,

644
00:41:23,045 --> 00:41:25,831
"Ooh, can we weaponize it?"

645
00:41:26,832 --> 00:41:28,094
Cause that's what we do.

646
00:41:30,139 --> 00:41:32,533
And they thought maybe
you could dump a bunch of it
in enemies drinking water

647
00:41:32,577 --> 00:41:36,363
to drive them crazy
or to pacify them

648
00:41:36,406 --> 00:41:40,454
or maybe you could torture
people with it, you know,
and use it as a truth serum.

649
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:43,675
Who knows the amazing
possibilities?

650
00:41:43,718 --> 00:41:48,114
Every other country was like,
"Seems like we're helping a lot
of people with this stuff."

651
00:41:48,157 --> 00:41:51,030
The US is like,
"But can we destroy them?"

652
00:41:51,073 --> 00:41:56,209
-It's just cultural differences;
it's the wackiest thing.
-[audience laughing]

653
00:41:56,252 --> 00:41:59,560
So they start doing all these
weird studies that
you can, you know,

654
00:41:59,604 --> 00:42:02,824
all the stuff's declassified
so you can read about it,

655
00:42:02,868 --> 00:42:06,219
but they do-- they strap
military troops to chairs

656
00:42:06,262 --> 00:42:12,791
and give them way too much LSD
to see if they could drive them
out of their minds or whatever.

657
00:42:12,834 --> 00:42:15,141
So this didn't go the
way that they'd hoped.

658
00:42:15,184 --> 00:42:21,408
All that happened was everyone
in the study was just like,
"Huh, why am I in the military?"

659
00:42:21,451 --> 00:42:25,020
[audience laughing and clapping]

660
00:42:27,066 --> 00:42:29,372
LSD is the one that
scares me the most

661
00:42:29,416 --> 00:42:33,115
because you can have a vile
that's like two hundred hits,
you don't know who's making it.

662
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:37,250
Ideally, if prohibition wasn't
a thing you'd have like a pill

663
00:42:37,293 --> 00:42:40,340
and you would know exactly
how much was in that pill

664
00:42:40,383 --> 00:42:49,305
and you could have that and
not accidentally have five, six
hits of LSD and lose your mind.

665
00:42:50,872 --> 00:42:56,748
I wish LSD was only done
in therapy settings.

666
00:43:00,708 --> 00:43:03,798
I'm not saying everyone should
go out and do psychedelics.

667
00:43:03,842 --> 00:43:07,367
I honestly don't believe
they're for everybody.
I believe they're for me.

668
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:09,804
Uh, I don't believe
they're for everybody.

669
00:43:09,848 --> 00:43:11,763
And I'm a psychonaut.

670
00:43:11,806 --> 00:43:15,505
Like I can, uh, I compare
myself, like what I'm
doing with psychedelics,

671
00:43:15,549 --> 00:43:18,987
exploring my mind
is the equivalent
to being an astronaut.

672
00:43:19,031 --> 00:43:22,295
I genuinely believe that's a--
that's a word in the culture

673
00:43:22,338 --> 00:43:24,558
and that's where I fall
in the culture.

674
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:27,692
And-- and so I'm not like peer
pressuring people to do it.

675
00:43:27,735 --> 00:43:33,175
Just because I'm like pro NASA
doesn't mean I'm like, "Hey,
everybody, get in the shuttle.

676
00:43:33,219 --> 00:43:38,267
You have to."
"No, I'm okay here. I'm
just enjoying myself here."

677
00:43:38,311 --> 00:43:43,359
"No, the world's going to look
totally different from out
there. You got to try it."

678
00:43:43,403 --> 00:43:45,274
"Don't they explode
sometimes?"

679
00:43:45,318 --> 00:43:48,930
"Well, yeah, sure, once in
a while, but that's
overplayed in the news."

680
00:43:48,974 --> 00:43:50,758
[audience laughing]

681
00:43:53,065 --> 00:43:58,810
And I'll be honest with you,
sometimes I do meet someone
who's just like a little off.

682
00:43:58,853 --> 00:44:01,377
[audience laughing]

683
00:44:01,421 --> 00:44:05,991
And it's always,
they always went a little
overboard with the LSD

684
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:12,214
and decided to try a forties
trip or something like that.

685
00:44:12,258 --> 00:44:15,478
Yeah, it's, uh, some
of us are explorers.

686
00:44:15,522 --> 00:44:18,046
So it's so-- sometimes the--

687
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:20,962
the moon isn't' good enough,
you got to get to Mars.

688
00:44:21,006 --> 00:44:23,530
And-- [laughing]

689
00:44:24,574 --> 00:44:29,101
and you're like, "What's
it going to be like out?"
"Who knows? Let's just go."

690
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:34,062
"We're not going to pack
or anything?" "Fuck no!"

691
00:44:36,499 --> 00:44:40,286
"Shouldn't we do some
calculations?" "Uh-uh.

692
00:44:40,329 --> 00:44:42,549
We got the fuel, let's go."

693
00:44:46,335 --> 00:44:51,123
So now for the first time we can
do psychedelic research,

694
00:44:51,166 --> 00:44:55,693
uh, combining the subjective
side, psychological interviews

695
00:44:55,736 --> 00:44:59,000
and psychological
questionnaires,
the physiological side,

696
00:44:59,044 --> 00:45:04,614
which is studying the--
the bloodstream and the heart
rate and the respiratory rhythm

697
00:45:04,658 --> 00:45:10,316
and looking at the brain
of live humans, awake,
in healthy conditions.

698
00:45:10,359 --> 00:45:14,842
This is completely unprecedented
and it also can shed light

699
00:45:14,886 --> 00:45:17,410
on how LSD can have
therapeutic effects

700
00:45:17,453 --> 00:45:21,631
once we better understand
what's doing to the brain
and to the mind.

701
00:45:21,675 --> 00:45:24,809
[Shane] A standard hit of LSD
is a hundred micrograms.

702
00:45:26,245 --> 00:45:29,204
I've done up to five
hundred micrograms.

703
00:45:29,248 --> 00:45:32,730
And sometimes you hear
of people doing a thousand,

704
00:45:32,773 --> 00:45:37,996
ten thousand micrograms
and that seems crazy.

705
00:45:38,997 --> 00:45:43,915
All my LSD experiences
are-- are just like,
"Oh, this is chill."

706
00:45:43,958 --> 00:45:48,789
A lot of times I do like
housework on LSD.

707
00:45:48,833 --> 00:45:53,663
It's just nice to sit
and be thinking
a little bit differently.

708
00:45:53,707 --> 00:45:58,668
But, I don't see like
crazy patterns like
a lot of people do.

709
00:45:58,712 --> 00:46:04,500
Each researcher tends to have
its own metaphor to try
to explain what's going on.

710
00:46:04,544 --> 00:46:09,027
Uh, my favorite, uh,
analogy is the radio.

711
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:10,811
[radio dialing]

712
00:46:12,813 --> 00:46:16,164
So if you're driving your car
and you're listening to one
radio station,

713
00:46:16,208 --> 00:46:19,080
what you're doing
is you're-- you're filtering
all of the others.

714
00:46:19,124 --> 00:46:22,040
They are transmitting
in other frequencies

715
00:46:22,083 --> 00:46:26,218
and you're killing them
so you just listen to one
specific station.

716
00:46:26,261 --> 00:46:28,655
And that's good because you can
listen clearly,

717
00:46:28,698 --> 00:46:32,528
the- the sound quality's good
and you understand everything
that's playing around.

718
00:46:35,488 --> 00:46:38,491
However, if your radio
is not fine-tuned

719
00:46:38,534 --> 00:46:43,017
you might get two
or three or more stations
at the same time.

720
00:46:43,061 --> 00:46:46,586
What LSD seems to be
doing to the brain
is something like this.

721
00:46:46,629 --> 00:46:52,070
So the brain has a fine-tuning
that in every specific moment
we are paying attention

722
00:46:52,113 --> 00:46:56,639
to some things in our
environment and we
are filtering out the rest.

723
00:46:56,683 --> 00:47:02,515
And what LSD seems to--
to do is to disturb this
filtering mechanism

724
00:47:02,558 --> 00:47:05,866
so we start kind of perceiving

725
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:09,827
what many brain
regions are doing differently
at the same time.

726
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:13,569
So one hand, that's quite
confusing because

727
00:47:13,613 --> 00:47:16,834
you-- you can't keep
the focus in-- in one thing.

728
00:47:16,877 --> 00:47:20,228
So if there are many people
talking, you can't really
focus on only one

729
00:47:20,272 --> 00:47:23,971
and you keep shifting
our attention and people
feel, uh, confused.

730
00:47:24,015 --> 00:47:27,540
On the other hand,
this has all to do with
creativity, for example,

731
00:47:27,583 --> 00:47:30,325
because creativity is
connecting together,

732
00:47:30,369 --> 00:47:33,720
uh, things that you
were separating these
different frequencies.

733
00:47:33,763 --> 00:47:36,201
You were considering them
different stations

734
00:47:36,244 --> 00:47:41,119
that have shows about different
topics and now all of a sudden
you're hearing them together

735
00:47:41,162 --> 00:47:44,426
and you make connections
that you were not making before.

736
00:47:48,517 --> 00:47:52,957
Psychiatrist Humphrey
Osmond introduced the word
'psychedelic' in 1956

737
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,439
and he wanted to capture
a sensation of the way in which
the mind is brought to light,

738
00:47:57,483 --> 00:48:00,051
or their subs-or concepts
brought to light.

739
00:48:00,094 --> 00:48:03,097
So he used the word 'psyche'
from the Greed word 'mind'

740
00:48:03,141 --> 00:48:06,535
and the word 'delos' in Greek
is to bring to light,

741
00:48:06,579 --> 00:48:09,103
so he combined these
to mean psychedelic.

742
00:48:09,147 --> 00:48:12,541
So the way that the mind
manifests or brings
things to light.

743
00:48:12,585 --> 00:48:14,761
And he used a clever rhyming
couplet when he did this.

744
00:48:14,804 --> 00:48:18,721
To fall in hell or soar
angelic, you'll need
a pinch of psychedelic.

745
00:48:23,509 --> 00:48:26,338
[Shane] Today, I'm doing
Ketamine for the first time.

746
00:48:26,381 --> 00:48:31,038
It's also my first time doing
psychedelics in a professional
therapeutic setting,

747
00:48:31,082 --> 00:48:34,085
something that I very
much believe in.

748
00:48:34,128 --> 00:48:38,437
And I'm more excited
than nervous, but
I'm a little nervous.

749
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:42,093
Ketamine is actually
something that I don't
know a whole lot about.

750
00:48:42,136 --> 00:48:46,271
All I really know is it's
notorious for something
called the K hole,

751
00:48:46,314 --> 00:48:51,754
which I don't totally
know what that is or means,
and it sounds horrible.

752
00:48:51,798 --> 00:48:55,628
Most hole-based
terminology is never positive.

753
00:48:55,671 --> 00:48:57,978
Ketamine is
a schedule III drug.

754
00:48:58,022 --> 00:49:01,634
That basically means that
the FDA and DEA classify it

755
00:49:01,677 --> 00:49:06,552
as having accepted medical
use and lower potential
for dependence

756
00:49:06,595 --> 00:49:10,512
than the more strictly
regulated schedule I
and schedule II drugs.

757
00:49:15,039 --> 00:49:16,475
[distant explosion]

758
00:49:17,476 --> 00:49:19,957
[woman] Here's
something depressing.

759
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:26,398
The Centers for Disease Control says roughly one in ten Americans today is depressed.

760
00:49:26,441 --> 00:49:29,749
One in ten Americans
take antidepressants.

761
00:49:29,792 --> 00:49:34,362
I think we go in swings
and cycles in social
and medical history.

762
00:49:34,406 --> 00:49:38,584
[Shane] If one third of
depressed people are not
responding to antidepressants,

763
00:49:38,627 --> 00:49:41,021
clearly, something
isn't working.

764
00:49:41,065 --> 00:49:45,243
When a drug comes on the market,
uh, pharmaceutical companies
are interested in launching it

765
00:49:45,286 --> 00:49:48,507
and trying to get it
out there where it
can begin to make money.

766
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:50,988
And, uh, so they actually
screen out, in most cases,

767
00:49:51,031 --> 00:49:53,773
patients with treatment
resistant mood disorders and so,

768
00:49:53,816 --> 00:49:56,558
uh, the original work that gets
drugs on the market

769
00:49:56,602 --> 00:50:01,476
often it doesn't apply to
patients that have multiple
comorbid and psychiatric soars

770
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,870
and have failed two or three
different antidepressants.

771
00:50:03,913 --> 00:50:07,178
Uh, treatments exist
in something like
an ecosystem, okay?

772
00:50:07,221 --> 00:50:10,311
Where they are like little
replicators competing for use.

773
00:50:10,355 --> 00:50:13,836
They compete for things like
money and time and interest.

774
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,577
One of the things that makes
them compete well

775
00:50:15,621 --> 00:50:18,537
is that they're effective
treatments, but that's
only one factor,

776
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:23,324
and it's very easily overwhelmed
by other factors that may make a
good treatment fail

777
00:50:23,368 --> 00:50:27,198
because it doesn't replicate
well economically
in the medical marketplace.

778
00:50:27,241 --> 00:50:31,071
Uh, unfortunately, there's no
money to be made with Ketamine
because it's off patent,

779
00:50:31,115 --> 00:50:34,988
so there isn't the financial
incentive that there
would be otherwise

780
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:36,163
for such a promising drug.

781
00:50:37,643 --> 00:50:39,384
[Terrance] Ketamine is a
dissociative anesthetication

782
00:50:39,427 --> 00:50:40,994
that's been around
since the late '60s.

783
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:43,170
It seems to help
the brain rewire itself.

784
00:50:43,214 --> 00:50:46,956
And several work has been
done demonstrating, uh,
the benefits of Ketamine,

785
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:52,962
uh, uh, for treatments of, uh,
depression, bipolar depression,
some work with PTSD.

786
00:50:53,006 --> 00:50:55,095
And we probably have
more data about Ketamine

787
00:50:55,139 --> 00:50:58,794
than any other medicine
that's used to treat,
uh, treat mood disorders.

788
00:51:01,841 --> 00:51:04,844
You mentioned that depression
going back about age
ten or thereabouts.

789
00:51:04,887 --> 00:51:06,628
-[Shane] Mm-hm.
-And when you-- when
you had depression

790
00:51:06,672 --> 00:51:08,761
over the years, what
happened to your sleep?

791
00:51:08,804 --> 00:51:11,242
-I think that I would
sleep a lot more.
-Okay.

792
00:51:11,285 --> 00:51:15,463
Uh, I-- I could-- I could sleep
and sleep and that's the
problem,

793
00:51:15,507 --> 00:51:17,944
I have a very, very,
very difficult time getting
out of bed.

794
00:51:17,987 --> 00:51:20,555
When you have depression, would
it just come out of the blue

795
00:51:20,599 --> 00:51:23,471
or would it, would
something happen that
would precipitate it?

796
00:51:23,515 --> 00:51:25,386
Seems like it's out of the blue.

797
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:28,476
It seems like I could be
having the best things
in my life happening.

798
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:30,783
Uh, tell me about
medical problems.

799
00:51:30,826 --> 00:51:33,960
I had a foot injury about three
years ago that was really severe

800
00:51:34,003 --> 00:51:37,529
and it required a couple
surgeries, but outside
of that I have been, uh,

801
00:51:37,572 --> 00:51:40,140
about as healthy
as a person can be.

802
00:51:40,184 --> 00:51:43,317
And, uh, how much alcohol
would you drink per week?

803
00:51:44,753 --> 00:51:46,494
Eight drinks a day.

804
00:51:46,538 --> 00:51:47,495
Okay.

805
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:50,846
And-- and what kind of drinks?

806
00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:54,023
Uh, a couple bottles of wine
in the night really easily.

807
00:51:54,067 --> 00:51:56,548
I tried to keep it down
to like a bottle.

808
00:51:56,591 --> 00:51:59,377
If I start drinking
hard alcohol,

809
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:04,382
probably like fifteen
or twenty shots worth in
a given night and black out.

810
00:52:04,425 --> 00:52:07,036
Okay. So that's-- that's---
that is an issue for you.

811
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:08,429
Mm-hmm.

812
00:52:08,473 --> 00:52:12,216
Um, okay, what about,
uh, cannabis or anything?

813
00:52:12,259 --> 00:52:14,131
-Yeah, that's not
really my thing.
-Okay.

814
00:52:14,174 --> 00:52:15,480
Once in a while.

815
00:52:15,523 --> 00:52:18,178
Do you have any, uh,
thoughts of suicide ever?

816
00:52:18,222 --> 00:52:22,269
-Not lately.
I used to constantly.
-Okay. Okay.

817
00:52:26,491 --> 00:52:29,929
[Shane] I'm comfortable
and I'm relaxed.

818
00:52:29,972 --> 00:52:31,670
All right, a little stick.

819
00:52:31,713 --> 00:52:34,151
[heart beating]

820
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:39,634
[Shane exhales]

821
00:52:45,118 --> 00:52:47,468
♪♪♪

822
00:52:47,512 --> 00:52:51,820
-Oh, God. Oh, there's
this rushing feeling.
-[Terrance] Yeah.

823
00:52:51,864 --> 00:52:58,653
[Shane] There's this like
beautiful like flowing feeling

824
00:52:58,697 --> 00:53:04,355
of like all's like moving
through me and it's out.

825
00:53:06,444 --> 00:53:13,190
The sense of connectedness
is everything.

826
00:53:14,147 --> 00:53:18,543
It's, whoa, yeah.

827
00:53:18,586 --> 00:53:27,160
There's this weird feeling
that sometimes I created all
of this or something like that.

828
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:31,208
When I'm tripping, what that
looks like is that I am God

829
00:53:31,251 --> 00:53:37,997
and I created all of this,
and I feel responsible
for the ugliness of this world.

830
00:53:39,041 --> 00:53:42,088
I can take time and space--

831
00:53:42,131 --> 00:53:44,177
-Mm-hmm.
-and manipulate it.

832
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:47,224
I-- I'm trying to explore
how the brain works.

833
00:53:50,618 --> 00:53:53,055
We are all Gods
of our own minds

834
00:53:53,099 --> 00:53:57,843
and so we did create
what's in our heads
on some level.

835
00:53:57,886 --> 00:54:02,021
So if you are seeing
this universe that's
inside of your head

836
00:54:02,064 --> 00:54:08,114
it is you and you are in charge
of it and you did make it.

837
00:54:08,157 --> 00:54:11,422
Guilt and responsibility. Yes.

838
00:54:11,465 --> 00:54:15,208
Those are big, big,
big parts of my life.

839
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:19,908
I have reoccurring themes
of guilt and responsibility.

840
00:54:19,952 --> 00:54:23,216
I think that's something that's
been there since childhood

841
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:28,743
was instilled in me by schools
and everything else.

842
00:54:32,356 --> 00:54:38,100
And I wasn't responsible
enough and I should
be ashamed of myself.

843
00:54:38,144 --> 00:54:40,538
-Terry--
-Yes.

844
00:54:40,581 --> 00:54:43,671
I was fiddling around
with the universe in there.

845
00:54:43,715 --> 00:54:46,457
-[giggling]
-Hoo!

846
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:49,111
[Shane] Ketamine
is a wonderful drug.

847
00:54:49,155 --> 00:54:50,417
I will say that.

848
00:54:51,418 --> 00:54:53,464
-Can I take these off?
-Sure.

849
00:54:55,335 --> 00:55:00,819
Whoa, I am still
going real hard.

850
00:55:00,862 --> 00:55:06,477
[Cole] Ketamine, the fact that
it works for unipolar and
bipolar depression, you know,

851
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:11,525
fifty-three percent of the time
it works the, you know,
on the first treatment.

852
00:55:11,569 --> 00:55:17,836
With repeat dosing, about
two thirds of people have
a response, which is incredible.

853
00:55:17,879 --> 00:55:19,881
So right now I'm shaky.

854
00:55:19,925 --> 00:55:23,885
When you're on Ketamine,
you have a faint memory
of what it was like to be human.

855
00:55:23,929 --> 00:55:29,064
And now that I'm a human,
uh, I have a faint memory
of remembering

856
00:55:29,108 --> 00:55:30,501
what Ketamine was like.

857
00:55:30,544 --> 00:55:33,634
-I was talking through
the whole thing?
-Mm-hmm.

858
00:55:33,678 --> 00:55:35,419
Oh, boy.

859
00:55:35,462 --> 00:55:38,726
Sort of the holy grail
of antidepressant treatment

860
00:55:38,770 --> 00:55:43,557
that is a game changer
about, uh, Ketamine
is that it works rapidly.

861
00:55:53,437 --> 00:55:57,049
Dimethyltryptamine,
it's in most living things.
It's already in your brain.

862
00:55:57,092 --> 00:56:00,748
People don't know what it's
doing or, some researchers think
it's responsible for dreaming

863
00:56:00,792 --> 00:56:05,579
and I get from some trips that
I had and other people are--
are, uh, some researchers think

864
00:56:05,623 --> 00:56:10,062
that it gets released
in high volumes right before
you die and that's why,

865
00:56:10,105 --> 00:56:15,023
um, uh, if people are lucky
enough to be revived they have
these stories seeing tunnels

866
00:56:15,067 --> 00:56:17,939
and Gods and spirits and,
you know, kingdoms, whatnot.

867
00:56:17,983 --> 00:56:23,423
Anyhow, you can smoke
that shit and, uh, have a little
peek see for yourself.

868
00:56:23,467 --> 00:56:25,120
-So--
-[audience laughing]

869
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:30,474
The first time I smoked DMT
I was like, whoa, man.

870
00:56:30,517 --> 00:56:35,566
Like so the first forty-five
seconds of my DMT
trip was total chaos.

871
00:56:35,609 --> 00:56:36,915
In my mind.

872
00:56:36,958 --> 00:56:39,265
Uh, in reality, I was just
slumped on a couch.

873
00:56:39,308 --> 00:56:43,356
I find that DMT is scarier
every time you do it.

874
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,402
There's no cautiousness.

875
00:56:45,445 --> 00:56:48,927
DMT says you got to jump off
the thirty meter dive.
That's where it starts.

876
00:56:48,970 --> 00:56:51,582
Most people believe in Gods
that they've never seen.

877
00:56:51,625 --> 00:56:54,193
I don't understand how
that's somehow less crazy

878
00:56:54,236 --> 00:56:58,284
than believing in the one
that you got to chill with
for eight minutes in eternity.

879
00:56:58,327 --> 00:57:00,329
[audience laughing]

880
00:57:00,373 --> 00:57:03,463
If you feel like, um,
you're going to die, die.

881
00:57:03,507 --> 00:57:05,813
If you feel like you're going
to go crazy, go crazy.

882
00:57:05,857 --> 00:57:10,339
If you feel like, um, you know,
you're going into this deep
well with darkness, go into it.

883
00:57:10,383 --> 00:57:12,254
Dive into it.

884
00:57:12,298 --> 00:57:17,042
If you're experiencing
that it is real and it is--
can be terrifying.

885
00:57:17,085 --> 00:57:22,656
MAOI is this, uh, is this
chemical that breaks
up DMT in your brain.

886
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:26,704
I know this person that
takes Syrian rue and makes
it into a body paint.

887
00:57:26,747 --> 00:57:30,969
So you can put the glow
in the dark body paint
with this MAOI inhibitor

888
00:57:31,012 --> 00:57:34,451
and it's like just a natural
antidepressant if
you're not doing DMT,

889
00:57:34,494 --> 00:57:38,150
but if you do DMT
it also just increases
it and makes it last longer.

890
00:57:38,193 --> 00:57:42,502
I wanted to like look really
crazy to do like an
attention-grabbing scene just

891
00:57:42,546 --> 00:57:45,984
to get people's attention
and then show how normal
psychedelics actually are.

892
00:57:46,027 --> 00:57:50,075
But, I wanted to make
myself look like a crazy
lunatic for a minute.

893
00:57:50,118 --> 00:57:54,253
And so I painted my
whole body in Syrian rue

894
00:57:55,297 --> 00:57:59,998
and then I smoked DMT
and right away this alien
comes out, I was like,

895
00:58:00,041 --> 00:58:03,915
"Good, you got the cameras,
now tell people
what they need to know."

896
00:58:03,958 --> 00:58:05,569
And I went, "Whoa,
what the fuck is happening?

897
00:58:07,571 --> 00:58:08,572
Wow.

898
00:58:12,619 --> 00:58:14,403
[whispering] This is nice.

899
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:34,032
[whispering]

900
00:58:40,342 --> 00:58:41,474
Heaven.

901
00:58:42,954 --> 00:58:44,172
Heaven.

902
00:58:45,826 --> 00:58:47,045
Yeah, yeah.

903
00:58:50,788 --> 00:58:53,965
Wow.

904
00:58:54,008 --> 00:58:55,706
Oh boy.

905
00:58:59,057 --> 00:59:00,798
I'll say it.

906
00:59:04,149 --> 00:59:08,457
How do I even say it? Ah, God.

907
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:23,211
Uh...

908
00:59:24,169 --> 00:59:26,737
There's like these four

909
00:59:27,651 --> 00:59:30,479
separate--Oh God.

910
00:59:48,933 --> 00:59:49,890
Wow.

911
00:59:51,762 --> 00:59:53,067
Hmm.

912
00:59:55,809 --> 00:59:57,332
There's this place.

913
00:59:57,376 --> 01:00:01,598
There's this place... [echoing]

914
01:00:03,382 --> 01:00:05,079
Oh.

915
01:00:05,123 --> 01:00:12,478
This is like one of many,
many, many, many
realities happening.

916
01:00:12,521 --> 01:00:14,567
Oh, there is this guy.

917
01:00:17,439 --> 01:00:21,313
There is this thing
controlling all of it.

918
01:00:25,709 --> 01:00:31,715
And it just goes,
"You, put it into words."

919
01:00:34,282 --> 01:00:39,548
I'm supposed to find a way
to put it all into words.

920
01:00:50,516 --> 01:00:52,605
-And that was it.
-[audience laughing]

921
01:00:53,519 --> 01:00:56,609
And I was just a hundred
percent back to normal,

922
01:00:56,653 --> 01:01:05,574
as clear-headed as I've ever
been in my entire life going,
"What the fuck was that?"

923
01:01:07,185 --> 01:01:10,405
Afterwards, I was like,
"That was weir-- that was--
that didn't happen.

924
01:01:10,449 --> 01:01:12,103
That was just DMT."

925
01:01:12,146 --> 01:01:15,193
And then I-- a month later

926
01:01:15,236 --> 01:01:18,892
I was like, "I gotta drink
ayahuasca because
it's a slower version of it."

927
01:01:22,722 --> 01:01:25,072
Ayahuasca is a brew.

928
01:01:25,116 --> 01:01:28,815
It's kind of the center of
ethno-medicine in the Amazon.

929
01:01:28,859 --> 01:01:34,125
And it's kind of unique
about traditional
indigenous psychedelics

930
01:01:34,168 --> 01:01:37,606
because it's made from
two plants and they
synergize each other.

931
01:01:37,650 --> 01:01:40,784
There's all this other shit
in ayahuasca that is in DMT

932
01:01:40,827 --> 01:01:44,788
that you need to take to be able
to take it orally that fucks
with your stomach so hard

933
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:48,095
that it sends off false alarms
way worse than mushrooms,

934
01:01:48,139 --> 01:01:51,229
so much so it tricks your brain
into thinking that you're dying,

935
01:01:51,272 --> 01:01:53,710
people project that
into their hallucinations.

936
01:01:53,753 --> 01:01:57,888
"Oh, I saw my own funeral."
"Oh, I had an ego death.

937
01:01:57,931 --> 01:02:02,631
Let me tell you
about my ego death."

938
01:02:02,675 --> 01:02:06,897
"Oh, you had an ego death,
did ya? Why are you
bragging about it?"

939
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:08,725
[audience laughing]

940
01:02:11,510 --> 01:02:15,079
"Pretty sure your ego
is alive and well."

941
01:02:15,122 --> 01:02:20,388
I would say ayahuasca
is not unlike dreams, you know.

942
01:02:20,432 --> 01:02:27,004
It's a very-- it's similar
to dreams where you do
have inner visionary states

943
01:02:27,047 --> 01:02:33,662
that are similar to DMT
because it is DMT, but
it's like not super-fast.

944
01:02:33,706 --> 01:02:39,799
So instead of 10 to 15 minutes,
which is what happens
when you smoke DMT,

945
01:02:39,843 --> 01:02:43,194
it's five to seven
or eight hours.

946
01:02:43,237 --> 01:02:45,370
It's much extended.

947
01:02:45,413 --> 01:02:48,242
So what you do, you sit in this
hut and there's a shaman
there, you drink this tea.

948
01:02:48,286 --> 01:02:50,418
And then for the next
four to six hours

949
01:02:50,462 --> 01:02:52,638
what you get to do is
you get to throw up all over
you and your new agey buddies.

950
01:02:52,681 --> 01:02:57,817
And then you realize that
you got to give up your steady
job to focus on pottery.

951
01:02:57,861 --> 01:03:01,429
The person that is leading
the experience
has also a great influence

952
01:03:01,473 --> 01:03:03,431
on the outcome
of the experience.

953
01:03:03,475 --> 01:03:05,477
So it's important to find
someone that you trust,

954
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:08,262
someone that is experienced,
that is skilled,
that is professional,

955
01:03:08,306 --> 01:03:09,786
and this is not always
the case, you know.

956
01:03:09,829 --> 01:03:13,006
So the combination
of challenging inner experiences

957
01:03:13,050 --> 01:03:15,792
with poor facilitation or poor
support on the outside,

958
01:03:15,835 --> 01:03:17,576
that can be a factor

959
01:03:17,619 --> 01:03:19,796
that really, really makes
an experience difficult
and challenging.

960
01:03:22,886 --> 01:03:26,541
[Shane] So I'm going to do an
underground ayahuasca ceremony.

961
01:03:26,585 --> 01:03:29,762
And we're not going
to be allowed to shoot
it because it's illegal

962
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:34,811
and the other people
in the ceremony, they
have to protect their identity.

963
01:03:35,681 --> 01:03:41,861
And we could have gone to Peru,
I suppose, and maybe shot this,

964
01:03:41,905 --> 01:03:46,387
but now we get to do a
clandestine ayahuasca ceremony.

965
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:48,825
And, I really like
the word 'clandestine.'

966
01:03:54,918 --> 01:04:01,838
I'll just give you a brief
summary of what I eventually
started sharing with people

967
01:04:01,881 --> 01:04:05,189
that put me in a psych ward. I--

968
01:04:05,232 --> 01:04:07,931
So I-- I'm bipolar.

969
01:04:07,974 --> 01:04:11,935
I've always been bipolar,
but I've been bipolar II

970
01:04:11,978 --> 01:04:15,852
and then I went up to
bipolar I, that's the big one.

971
01:04:15,895 --> 01:04:19,551
I didn't know like bipolar II
is the coward's bipolar.

972
01:04:19,594 --> 01:04:21,335
[audience laughing]

973
01:04:21,379 --> 01:04:27,124
And like I was just having
dreams of like,

974
01:04:27,167 --> 01:04:30,649
"Maybe I can be a standup
comedian on television."

975
01:04:30,692 --> 01:04:34,392
Uh, and then I'm like "Oh,
maybe I'll kill myself one day."

976
01:04:34,435 --> 01:04:43,140
And tho-- that is like such
a quaint version of bipolar.

977
01:04:43,183 --> 01:04:48,667
Bipolar I is like I can
change the laws of physics
with my mind.

978
01:04:48,710 --> 01:04:51,844
And because I just did that,
now I can't kill myself anymore

979
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:56,805
because now I'll just show up on
another timeline and who knows
how miserable that one will be.

980
01:04:57,981 --> 01:05:04,944
People get into trouble
I think with psychedelics
when they realize that their--

981
01:05:04,988 --> 01:05:12,125
their sort of models of reality
are melting and shattering
and that's very uncomfortable.

982
01:05:12,169 --> 01:05:16,303
But, well, why'd you take
the damn psychedelic if you
didn't expect this to happen?

983
01:05:16,347 --> 01:05:17,696
That's what they do.

984
01:05:17,739 --> 01:05:20,699
We come back from these
experiences a proselyte,

985
01:05:20,742 --> 01:05:22,657
you know, ranting
and raving, telling people,

986
01:05:22,701 --> 01:05:25,443
"We've got to get our shit
together in the next few
years, it's happening."

987
01:05:25,486 --> 01:05:29,316
Even though it's all
happening at once from it--
the eternal point of view,

988
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:32,798
that doesn't mean it's happening
within your lifetime.

989
01:05:32,841 --> 01:05:36,497
That would mean
that the prophecy is about
your individual life,

990
01:05:36,541 --> 01:05:39,587
it's about the date that
you're going on tomorrow

991
01:05:39,631 --> 01:05:43,113
and it's about the beginning
and end of the whole cosmos.

992
01:05:45,202 --> 01:05:47,117
[Shane] I'd done
ayahuasca before

993
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:53,645
and it was pretty mild
compared to smoking DMT
so I had low expectations.

994
01:05:53,688 --> 01:05:57,214
I took more than I think
you're supposed to.

995
01:05:57,257 --> 01:06:02,175
Some sort of universal
consciousness that
I don't normally believe in,

996
01:06:02,219 --> 01:06:06,223
in any way, uh, made
itself very clear to me.

997
01:06:06,266 --> 01:06:13,273
And started telling me
a bunch of things about
history and space, time.

998
01:06:13,317 --> 01:06:15,972
I was just trying
to be accepting.

999
01:06:16,842 --> 01:06:21,020
This time, I think I might
have clicked accept

1000
01:06:21,064 --> 01:06:24,850
without really reading
the terms and conditions.

1001
01:06:24,893 --> 01:06:32,510
Ayahuasca asked me to be some
sort of messenger, or DMT,

1002
01:06:32,553 --> 01:06:37,384
and I was like, 'Sure,' not
really taking it very seriously.

1003
01:06:37,428 --> 01:06:42,781
And then I got this massive
download, like it felt
like a bolt of lightning

1004
01:06:42,824 --> 01:06:46,480
struck my head and the whole
house started shaking.

1005
01:06:47,699 --> 01:06:49,744
I thought I had
hallucinated all of this.

1006
01:06:49,788 --> 01:06:54,010
I asked people afterwards
and they had heard
the house nearly collapsing

1007
01:06:54,053 --> 01:06:56,360
right where I was as well.

1008
01:06:56,403 --> 01:07:01,365
So we went and checked it out
and right under where I was
there was this enormous crack.

1009
01:07:02,322 --> 01:07:04,107
Whatever.

1010
01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:08,850
I wake up the next morning
and the first text I get
out of the blue

1011
01:07:08,894 --> 01:07:16,510
asking me if I will
participate in this new
groundbreaking DMT study.

1012
01:07:16,554 --> 01:07:20,688
That's when I started
to freak out a little bit.

1013
01:07:20,732 --> 01:07:24,083
Then everything started
feeling like déjà vu.

1014
01:07:24,127 --> 01:07:28,435
And not like a couple
seconds of, "Oh, I think
I've done this before."

1015
01:07:28,479 --> 01:07:34,050
[echoing] This was minutes,
became hours, became days,

1016
01:07:34,093 --> 01:07:39,446
and now I've been up for several
days in a manic state

1017
01:07:39,490 --> 01:07:43,494
trying to figure out
the physics of how there's
these other dimensions,

1018
01:07:43,537 --> 01:07:49,065
that we're able to communicate
somehow, that we
can't normally perceive.

1019
01:07:49,108 --> 01:07:52,677
And I start thinking of these
kind of complicated formulas

1020
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:57,116
of how time works and how
messages could be sent
back through time.

1021
01:07:57,160 --> 01:08:01,903
Starting to think that
my ideas are eventually
going to change the future

1022
01:08:01,947 --> 01:08:05,646
and because they're
changing the future they're
sending ripples back

1023
01:08:05,690 --> 01:08:10,129
through time that are changing
my environment.

1024
01:08:10,173 --> 01:08:14,960
After about a week of this,
I went to a concert,
Roger Waters of Pink Floyd.

1025
01:08:15,003 --> 01:08:20,139
That's when I believed that
Roger Waters was communicating
with me telepathically,

1026
01:08:20,183 --> 01:08:26,493
that I had created some hair
in the fabric of space-time,

1027
01:08:26,537 --> 01:08:30,541
created these new timelines
that I was trying
to correct with my mind.

1028
01:08:31,498 --> 01:08:34,545
So that's when things
started kind of deteriorating.

1029
01:08:34,588 --> 01:08:39,637
Skip forward another two weeks
of me not sleeping and now
I'm insanely paranoid.

1030
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:42,292
I believe I'm being
watched, followed.

1031
01:08:42,335 --> 01:08:47,427
I don't know if I'm getting
signs from God
or aliens or the universe

1032
01:08:47,471 --> 01:08:52,998
or if some sort of time
police are after me
or DEA is after me

1033
01:08:53,041 --> 01:08:55,957
because I'd figured out
a way to end prohibition.

1034
01:08:56,001 --> 01:09:01,267
If the cartel was coming after
me because I had eliminated
their source of income.

1035
01:09:04,270 --> 01:09:09,188
And those are the kind
of thoughts that if
you share with people

1036
01:09:09,232 --> 01:09:11,756
you are going to the psych ward.

1037
01:09:12,670 --> 01:09:19,285
My girlfriend was like super
tolerant the whole time and like
was really like on her wits-end.

1038
01:09:19,329 --> 01:09:23,202
And then I was like, right
at the end, I was like,

1039
01:09:24,247 --> 01:09:26,771
"We need to elope
and have a baby."

1040
01:09:26,814 --> 01:09:30,644
And that's when she was like,
"You're fuckin' crazy."

1041
01:09:30,688 --> 01:09:36,998
And that's when I got
hospitalized for a grand
romantic gesture.

1042
01:09:37,042 --> 01:09:40,219
Did you hear everything
else that I said?

1043
01:09:41,786 --> 01:09:46,225
I didn't get hospitalized
for all that shit.

1044
01:09:46,269 --> 01:09:51,970
I just did the most romantic
thing in my life and that's what
put me in the psych ward.

1045
01:09:52,013 --> 01:09:55,191
And then when you think the
world is coming against you

1046
01:09:55,234 --> 01:09:58,237
don't put someone in a psych
ward that's filled with cameras

1047
01:09:58,281 --> 01:10:02,937
and then someone
on a clipboard who like
monitoring your every move

1048
01:10:02,981 --> 01:10:06,114
because, oh God,
they were-- they were
fucking after me.

1049
01:10:06,158 --> 01:10:10,249
And, um, turns out I just
needed sleep, I guess.

1050
01:10:10,293 --> 01:10:14,340
That's the best explanation
that I have for all of that.

1051
01:10:14,384 --> 01:10:17,213
-So, uh, thank you guys.
-[audience cheering]

1052
01:10:19,824 --> 01:10:22,087
Maybe you can explain
these to me?

1053
01:10:22,130 --> 01:10:25,308
So I went to make a
documentary about,

1054
01:10:25,351 --> 01:10:30,530
uh, these cutting-edge
new treatments

1055
01:10:30,574 --> 01:10:35,840
that can hopefully free us
from pharmaceutical drugs.

1056
01:10:35,883 --> 01:10:38,234
-And I ended it on--
-I heard you.

1057
01:10:39,626 --> 01:10:46,546
--on the most amount
of pharmaceutical drugs I've
ever been on in my entire life.

1058
01:10:46,590 --> 01:10:52,073
So those are definitely
what I would expect, you know,
Lorazepam and Gabapentin.

1059
01:10:52,117 --> 01:10:56,774
It sounds like you had sort
of the euphoric kind of manic
episode, which man,

1060
01:10:56,817 --> 01:10:59,342
you know, like being a doctor
who tries to tell somebody

1061
01:10:59,385 --> 01:11:02,780
who is obviously having
a better day than I am

1062
01:11:02,823 --> 01:11:08,438
that there's something wrong
and they need to take medicine,
like that's a tough sell.

1063
01:11:08,481 --> 01:11:11,702
That's a very dangerous place
that you found yourself in.

1064
01:11:11,745 --> 01:11:16,054
People have been known
to blow family fortunes,
not just their own fortune,

1065
01:11:16,097 --> 01:11:20,493
other people's fortunes,
the grandiosity leads
to risk-taking behavior.

1066
01:11:20,537 --> 01:11:23,496
People who would normally wear
seatbelts don't wear seatbelts,

1067
01:11:23,540 --> 01:11:26,934
they drive more dangerously,
they jump off of things,

1068
01:11:26,978 --> 01:11:31,896
they, you know, just in general
risk-taking in every fashion.

1069
01:11:31,939 --> 01:11:34,377
So do you think that, uh,
psychedelics are responsible

1070
01:11:34,420 --> 01:11:37,118
for taking me from
bipolar II to bipolar I?

1071
01:11:37,162 --> 01:11:43,516
It's because of this
existing predisposition
to extreme mood states

1072
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:46,476
that that's the way you
reacted to that stressor.

1073
01:11:46,519 --> 01:11:53,439
I would be interested
to know if you would have
ever had a manic episode

1074
01:11:53,483 --> 01:11:56,747
had you not had
psychedelics. I think,

1075
01:11:56,790 --> 01:12:01,360
I wouldn't be surprised
if you wouldn't have had
a manic episode

1076
01:12:01,404 --> 01:12:03,536
that required hospitalization.

1077
01:12:03,580 --> 01:12:05,712
I-- I know how crazy this sounds

1078
01:12:05,756 --> 01:12:11,892
but I still sort of feel
like doing ayahuasca
again to finish the job.

1079
01:12:11,936 --> 01:12:14,025
-Would you advise that?
-Uh-huh.

1080
01:12:16,375 --> 01:12:21,424
Uh, well, hopefully the science
will be there some day to know
the answer to, you know, like--

1081
01:12:21,467 --> 01:12:23,034
Yeah, yeah.

1082
01:12:23,077 --> 01:12:24,775
-what it is that happened
in the first place and--
-Yeah.

1083
01:12:24,818 --> 01:12:26,298
--whether or not it's safe.

1084
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:29,693
That's the tragedy
of the war on drugs

1085
01:12:29,736 --> 01:12:36,134
is we don't know
the answers to like
these ancient compounds

1086
01:12:36,177 --> 01:12:40,878
despite all of this sort
of colloquial knowledge and

1087
01:12:40,921 --> 01:12:45,056
-but the plural of anecdote
is not data that was, you know.
-Mm-mm.

1088
01:12:45,099 --> 01:12:49,495
It's not just a lot of stories
that sound promising,

1089
01:12:49,539 --> 01:12:54,065
it's not the same thing
as a really truly well designed,

1090
01:12:54,108 --> 01:12:57,808
you know, investigation
of a scientific question.

1091
01:12:57,851 --> 01:13:01,115
So, you know, from
a mental health standpoint,

1092
01:13:01,159 --> 01:13:03,553
I wouldn't have recommended
doing them in the first place.

1093
01:13:06,469 --> 01:13:09,341
I have this good friend
that he's a shaman,

1094
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:13,432
he has learned in Peru
for many, many years and he
does ceremonies in Europe.

1095
01:13:13,476 --> 01:13:17,436
And he says it's very easy
to forgive your father
in an ayahuasca session.

1096
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:21,440
What is difficult is to go back
home and to act on that
forgiveness, you know,

1097
01:13:21,484 --> 01:13:23,181
to really forgive your father.

1098
01:13:23,224 --> 01:13:25,531
And this is what--
what the integration
really means, you know,

1099
01:13:25,575 --> 01:13:30,406
to practice, to act on the
teachings and the learnings
that we get from the experience

1100
01:13:30,449 --> 01:13:32,538
and that is not that
easy to do, you know.

1101
01:13:32,582 --> 01:13:35,976
So if you have an intention,
you know what
you want to work on

1102
01:13:36,020 --> 01:13:39,284
and you know what objectives
you have and then

1103
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:42,113
you know that after
the experience you still
need to do something.

1104
01:13:42,156 --> 01:13:45,986
So the experience is not like
the magic pill, the experience
is gonna show you some things

1105
01:13:46,030 --> 01:13:48,598
and then you're-- you're free
to choose what do you do

1106
01:13:48,641 --> 01:13:51,949
with what you've seen
and then another path begins.

1107
01:13:51,992 --> 01:13:55,518
We always say that
the actual work begins
after the experience.

1108
01:13:58,956 --> 01:14:01,001
When I had to go back
and integrate things,

1109
01:14:01,045 --> 01:14:04,440
I had to integrate things
from my life, the open
loops that drive you crazy.

1110
01:14:04,483 --> 01:14:09,532
Like, "I said something
stupid in front of a girl
and I was in sixth grade

1111
01:14:09,575 --> 01:14:13,536
and embarrassed myself
in front of my crush
and everyone that I liked,"

1112
01:14:13,579 --> 01:14:16,103
and I had to revisit
that painful thing.

1113
01:14:16,147 --> 01:14:20,934
Or, "Oh, I bullied this kid
and for being gay when
I was in fourth grade

1114
01:14:20,978 --> 01:14:24,242
because I didn't understand
and I didn't know better, but
I should have known better."

1115
01:14:24,285 --> 01:14:27,898
And you got to go back
and relive that and find a way
to forgive yourself for it.

1116
01:14:27,941 --> 01:14:32,119
That's a really hard
process, but you will
have that plaguing you.

1117
01:14:32,163 --> 01:14:35,558
Like and that-- that will
be your own personal hell.

1118
01:14:35,601 --> 01:14:40,214
We all have these open loops
of just something bad or, uh,
happened to you in your life

1119
01:14:40,258 --> 01:14:42,347
or something that you
never fully processed

1120
01:14:42,390 --> 01:14:46,133
and so your brain's just
screaming at you like,
"Hey, don't forget about this.

1121
01:14:46,177 --> 01:14:49,049
This is a threat in the
environment. You got
to remember this lesson.

1122
01:14:49,093 --> 01:14:50,573
It's very important."

1123
01:14:50,616 --> 01:14:52,966
And a lot of those lessons
you have no use for anymore

1124
01:14:53,010 --> 01:14:57,536
because they happened when
you were a kid or just in
a different phase of your life.

1125
01:14:57,580 --> 01:15:03,194
So going back and kind
of reliving them brings closure
and it closes those open loops.

1126
01:15:03,237 --> 01:15:05,152
Um, that's how I think
about it anyway.

1127
01:15:05,196 --> 01:15:08,678
So that's why
I think integration
is exceptionally important.

1128
01:15:09,940 --> 01:15:13,073
But it's still, like I look back
on it and some of the,

1129
01:15:13,117 --> 01:15:15,685
like some of the drawings
that I made are
some of the best ideas

1130
01:15:15,728 --> 01:15:18,514
still to this day that
I've ever had in my life.

1131
01:15:18,557 --> 01:15:22,213
But-- but then I also,

1132
01:15:22,256 --> 01:15:25,564
it came along
with the most delusional
ideas that I've ever had.

1133
01:15:25,608 --> 01:15:29,307
So then-- and then that's
like really embarrassing and--

1134
01:15:29,350 --> 01:15:33,833
and you worry, I don't want
to do that to like my friends
and family again.

1135
01:15:35,443 --> 01:15:37,620
But, uh, fuck,
it was interesting.

1136
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:45,410
Careful what you wish for.

1137
01:15:45,453 --> 01:15:53,461
That was a bit intense
and a little scarier
than I was anticipating.

1138
01:15:53,505 --> 01:15:55,594
I did end up getting
what I wanted.

1139
01:15:55,638 --> 01:15:58,771
I've quit drinking.
I quit smoking cigarettes.

1140
01:15:58,815 --> 01:16:00,730
I've been taking
better care of myself.

1141
01:16:00,773 --> 01:16:05,125
I've been meditating more
with the help of sensory
deprivation tanks.

1142
01:16:05,169 --> 01:16:08,781
I've been eating right
and exercising.

1143
01:16:08,825 --> 01:16:12,785
And I think I've really
had enough excitement
in my life for a while.

1144
01:16:14,482 --> 01:16:21,751
Although psychedelics have been an incredibly positive influence on my life for 21 years,

1145
01:16:21,794 --> 01:16:27,191
they do also have the potential to drive you completely
insane for a month or so.

1146
01:16:27,234 --> 01:16:29,367
I don't think psychedelics
are everything,

1147
01:16:29,410 --> 01:16:32,588
but after spending years
of interviewing scientists

1148
01:16:32,631 --> 01:16:35,503
from all sorts of different
fields of science,

1149
01:16:35,547 --> 01:16:37,854
psychedelic research,
from my point of view,

1150
01:16:37,897 --> 01:16:43,424
has the most potential
to create real positive change
for individuals and societies.

1151
01:16:43,468 --> 01:16:46,819
Of course, that could just
be the MDMA talking.

1152
01:16:46,863 --> 01:16:50,867
Hopefully, in the future, we'll have more reasonable laws; there will be more research,

1153
01:16:50,910 --> 01:16:55,915
and we'll have a better
understanding of how
to use these things correctly.

1154
01:16:55,959 --> 01:16:58,614
Some people do psychedelics
and like, "I saw the truth."

1155
01:16:58,657 --> 01:17:01,312
Uh, that's just like
how it feels sometimes.

1156
01:17:01,355 --> 01:17:06,883
Uh, I think that, uh, I think
that if you quit questioning
you ruin the whole point,

1157
01:17:06,926 --> 01:17:11,801
just to question fucking
everything, that is the most
important message in life.

1158
01:17:11,844 --> 01:17:13,803
-No, I know.
-[audience clapping]

1159
01:17:13,846 --> 01:17:17,937
I mean some people are like,
"Question everything?"
Now you're getting it.

1160
01:17:17,981 --> 01:17:18,895
Because--

1161
01:17:21,593 --> 01:17:25,728
because I think the-- the reason
why, in case you do ever
have a trip that you're like,

1162
01:17:25,771 --> 01:17:29,819
"This is the absolute truth
and there's no way
of looking at it."

1163
01:17:29,862 --> 01:17:35,128
Just re-- please, remember this,
and this has helped me out
of that situation many times,

1164
01:17:35,172 --> 01:17:40,960
uh, uh, the reason why those
trips seem so real and so true

1165
01:17:41,004 --> 01:17:44,224
is because they are for such
a short amount of time

1166
01:17:44,268 --> 01:17:49,969
and they are so different
and so intense and so,
uh, crazy seeming.

1167
01:17:50,013 --> 01:17:51,971
It's very salient.

1168
01:17:52,015 --> 01:17:55,714
Imagine instead that someone
is born, like they're on LSD
all of the time.

1169
01:17:55,758 --> 01:18:00,501
That's just normal life
for them and they just live this
weird technicolored existence.

1170
01:18:00,545 --> 01:18:04,680
And then one day when--

1171
01:18:04,723 --> 01:18:11,164
when they're like, uh, an adult
someone gives them a pill
that brings them to our reality.

1172
01:18:11,208 --> 01:18:15,995
It would seem just as crazy
and trippy to them.

1173
01:18:16,039 --> 01:18:18,302
"Oh my, God, I get it now.

1174
01:18:18,345 --> 01:18:21,392
It's like there's these
things called jobs

1175
01:18:21,435 --> 01:18:26,832
and entry level positions
that one can apply for.

1176
01:18:26,876 --> 01:18:29,705
It's like there's these weird
hierarchies within these jobs,

1177
01:18:29,748 --> 01:18:32,620
where you just kind of show up
on time each day.

1178
01:18:32,664 --> 01:18:35,841
And sure, you got to kiss
a little ass here and there,
maybe step on a few toes;

1179
01:18:35,885 --> 01:18:37,582
I didn't say it was
going to be pleasant.

1180
01:18:37,625 --> 01:18:41,978
But you can potentially
elevate your status
on that hierarchy.

1181
01:18:42,021 --> 01:18:44,110
Oh my, God.

1182
01:18:44,154 --> 01:18:49,812
It's like there's a potential
boss inside each and every
one of us! Holy shit!"

1183
01:18:50,900 --> 01:18:55,687
The point is, guys, life is
a trip and I hope you guys make
yours the best one possible.

1184
01:18:55,731 --> 01:18:58,864
-Thank you so much for coming.
