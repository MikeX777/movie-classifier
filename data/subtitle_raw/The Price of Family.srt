1
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:39,208
Here we are.

2
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:42,166
All set.

3
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,875
{\an8}My room is cleared out.

4
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:46,291
{\an8}What will you do with it?

5
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:48,291
{\an8}I'd like to put in a treadmill.

6
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,041
{\an8}Great idea.

7
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:52,416
{\an8}Your mom wants to keep it as is,

8
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,000
{\an8}while she waits
for your life to fall apart

9
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:58,291
{\an8}so you'll come back
and she'll look after you forever.

10
00:01:58,375 --> 00:02:00,583
{\an8}- That's not true.
- That's creepy.

11
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:02,000
{\an8}Tell me about it.

12
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:06,208
{\an8}All right. I'll put this in the van.

13
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:20,791
{\an8}Look, I'm smiling.

14
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:32,041
{\an8}Anna.

15
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:33,625
{\an8}Loredana, hi.

16
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:37,875
{\an8}In two weeks, you'll enjoy
having them out of your hair.

17
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:41,583
I know how you feel.

18
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:45,250
When Maya and Pietro left,
it was such an emotional moment.

19
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:47,666
Intimate.

20
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,333
Intimate, indeed.

21
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:51,083
A family-only moment.

22
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:53,750
- Okay, we're done.
- Yeah.

23
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:55,833
Please come back home,

24
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:58,041
at least to watch soccer games with Dad.

25
00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:00,833
I mean, don't make me watch them.

26
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:02,083
Sure, Mom.

27
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:04,416
Not to meddle,

28
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,041
but why move to the city
when it's so lovely here?

29
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:09,083
She has a point.

30
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:10,833
{\an8}BASED ON "MES TRÈS CHERS ENFANTS"

31
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:11,875
{\an8}- Bye.
- Bye.

32
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:12,791
{\an8}Bye.

33
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,833
Bye, Mom.

34
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:22,458
{\an8}Go on.

35
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,291
I'm making lasagna tomorrow.
Come for lunch.

36
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,916
Just kidding.

37
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,750
- I was kidding.
- Come on.

38
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:35,541
CAR AND VAN RENTALS THROUGHOUT ITALY

39
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,083
15 MONTHS LATER

40
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:07,583
Emilio and Alessandra
only call when they need something.

41
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:09,916
They don't even show up for a funeral.

42
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:15,041
She's just an old lady
they saw no more than three times.

43
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,916
She was still a relative, Mom.

44
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,541
- Be strong.
- Carlo.

45
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:26,041
- Bye.
- I am so sorry.

46
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:28,666
And it was totally unexpected.

47
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:33,000
She drank like a fish for 90 years.
It's no wonder she croaked.

48
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,500
How's Alessandra?
Haven't seen her in ages.

49
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:36,416
She's fine.

50
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:42,458
Sadly, she couldn't come.
She had... a job interview.

51
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:44,958
- A job interview? Great. What for?
- Yeah.

52
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,041
Well...

53
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:51,375
- She didn't say. She's superstitious.
- Heroin dealer.

54
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:54,375
What about Emilio?

55
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:57,583
He had to attend a more important funeral.

56
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:59,750
He couldn't make it. Shall we go?

57
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:00,791
I'm coming, Mom.

58
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:05,625
They keep changing her drug dosages.

59
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:08,125
She's on an emotional roller coaster.

60
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,083
- All right. Bye, Anna.
- Bye.

61
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:13,125
- Bye, dear.
- How pretty you are.

62
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:15,041
- You're right.
- Hold on to her.

63
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:16,791
Bye.

64
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:24,333
<i>Hold on a second, please.</i>

65
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:27,458
<i>- Are you there?</i>
- Yes, Mom.

66
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:28,375
Great.

67
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:31,583
Listen, Dad and I can't wait to see you

68
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:32,958
and be together.

69
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:34,875
Me too.

70
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:36,666
<i>Guess what I'm going to make?</i>

71
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:38,916
Stuffed guinea fowl.

72
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,833
I'm vegan. Don't you remember?

73
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:44,125
Come on, sweetie, it's your birthday.

74
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:47,458
All right. See you tomorrow, then.

75
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:49,166
Ale, one more thing.

76
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,083
I saw your WhatsApp profile picture.

77
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:55,458
<i>It looks like an ad
for a Colombian brothel.</i>

78
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:56,625
What?

79
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:59,291
I mean, it's beautiful, as you are.

80
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:00,958
But what's the point?

81
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:03,250
The point of what?

82
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:07,250
Posing half-naked in the mirror
with your mouth...

83
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:11,583
Your lips look like
they're being sucked by a vacuum.

84
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:13,125
See you tomorrow.

85
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:14,875
What time are you coming?

86
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,250
1:30?

87
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:18,500
Why not noon?

88
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:21,916
<i>We'll spend some time together.
You'll give me a hand.</i>

89
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,125
- Fine. See you tomorrow.
<i>- Bye, honey.</i>

90
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:27,375
<i>- Bye, Mom.</i>
- Hey, honey, wait...

91
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,875
Emi, honey, there's been a change of plan.

92
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:38,833
Your sister wants to come at noon.

93
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:41,333
So I think you should do the same.

94
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:44,833
We'll spend time together.
It's gonna be a fun birthday.

95
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:47,625
I can't wait, sweetie.
I'm counting on you.

96
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:48,750
Bye, honey.

97
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:52,500
THE RESISTANCE

98
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,083
It's gonna be great...

99
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:17,416
Happy birthday!

100
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:21,791
- Happy birthday, honey.
- Happy birthday.

101
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:25,708
HAPPY BIRTHDAY

102
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,000
THE TRUE ITALIAN ESPRESSO

103
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:11,958
All right. I'll clear the table.

104
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:19,416
I'm not gonna skip the meal
because you're pissed off.

105
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,750
I'm calm.

106
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:24,958
Come on. Maybe they forgot.

107
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:27,875
- Or they're just late.
- Stop talking bullshit.

108
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:31,833
They're kids. They're supposed
to break away from their parents.

109
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,458
And in this specific case,

110
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:37,500
they probably can't stand you guys.

111
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:38,750
Thanks, Mom.

112
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:48,041
Stop calling her, please.
It's humiliating.

113
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:00,833
Don't be a child!

114
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:08,541
I made the cake.
I'll do what I want with it.

115
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,625
- What if they come?
- They won't.

116
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:15,041
They can eat it
from the dumpster like wild boars.

117
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:28,500
- Hi.
- Hi.

118
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,041
- I'm waiting for Maya.
- That's nice.

119
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:35,333
- Your kids aren't coming for lunch?
- Huh?

120
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:39,041
I thought today was Alessandra's birthday.

121
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:41,750
Right. Good memory.

122
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,625
She's not coming to celebrate?

123
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:49,250
No. She doesn't want me
to work too hard in the kitchen.

124
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:52,125
She'll take us out somewhere
as a surprise.

125
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,041
Nice.

126
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:58,625
Coming home to eat all the time
is such a drag. I mean, what a pain.

127
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:00,583
We like it, though.

128
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:07,166
Did your people learn to honk
before they could walk?

129
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,000
Hi, honey.

130
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:16,166
Maya is pregnant again.

131
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,166
No.

132
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:20,208
She isn't?

133
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:22,083
She looks like it.

134
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,041
Bye.

135
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:52,250
Where are we meeting Emilio?

136
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:54,333
At a bar near his office.

137
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:58,125
We'll have a quick aperitif
because he has dinner afterwards.

138
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:01,416
Since we're near Alessandra's,

139
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,333
we should ask her to join us.

140
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:05,791
- Fat chance.
- We can still try.

141
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:06,708
All right.

142
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:19,625
Look, there she is.

143
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:25,791
So she does smoke. What a liar.
She told me she quit.

144
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:33,208
- Did you see the face she made?
- What face?

145
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:36,708
A what-does-this-pain-in-the-ass-want
face.

146
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:39,166
- What are you talking about?
- No?

147
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,291
Come on.

148
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:47,958
Look.

149
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,750
See that face?

150
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,291
Hello, Mom. Tell me quick. I'm working.

151
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:54,208
Are you smoking?

152
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:55,958
No.

153
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:57,666
<i>No, I'm not smoking.</i>

154
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,333
What's wrong, Mom?

155
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:04,250
Well, we came to have
an aperitif with your brother.

156
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:06,833
Yeah, but I'm work... Listen, Mom, I...

157
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,375
I can't come for Christmas lunch.

158
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:11,625
I completely forgot to tell you.

159
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:13,958
- What?
- What do you mean?

160
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I'm going to Paris with Rocco.
Sorry, I forgot to tell you.

161
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:22,791
<i>Hello? Mom?</i>

162
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:24,708
Mom?

163
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:26,875
Shall we go?

164
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:30,416
- But we're here. Let's say hi.
- Let's go.

165
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:31,791
Let's go.

166
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,541
You know what makes me happy
this Christmas?

167
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:02,833
- No.
- Hope.

168
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,375
I hope Rocco will dump our daughter,

169
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:09,375
and she'll come crawling back
to be consoled.

170
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:12,416
"Crawling"? That's very Christmassy.

171
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
And when she tries to come in,

172
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:21,625
with a smile on your face,
you'll tell her, "I'm so sorry, sweetie."

173
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:25,166
"Mom and I are not a towel
that you wipe your ass with."

174
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,958
Or maybe you can tell her that.

175
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,166
Hey, there.

176
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,333
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

177
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,125
Here I am.

178
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:35,583
- Here are the ironed ones.
- Thank you.

179
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:37,375
Careful. Don't wrinkle them.

180
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:41,833
Take my dirty shirts. It'd be perfect
if you could wash them by Wednesday.

181
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:42,750
Sure.

182
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:44,833
Dry cleaners do exist, you know.

183
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:46,916
I can't with my salary.

184
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Whining to Mommy and Daddy?

185
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:51,583
No. He's Azeglio, my boss.

186
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:53,083
- My parents.
- Hello.

187
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,791
- Hello, I'm Anna.
- Right.

188
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:58,000
Nice to meet you. Kudos on your son.

189
00:13:58,083 --> 00:13:59,166
Thank you.

190
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,625
Kudos, as you must be such good people

191
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,666
not to give him up for adoption.

192
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:05,958
Am I right?

193
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:07,458
Just kidding.

194
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:10,541
Don't drink.
We have a conference call in an hour.

195
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:11,625
Tonight?

196
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:13,208
No. By "in an hour,"

197
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:15,625
I mean in an hour tomorrow.

198
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:16,541
Okay, then.

199
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:21,000
Okay, what? Of course it's tonight.
Wake the fuck up. Come on.

200
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:23,291
- Let's go. Have a nice evening.
- Bye.

201
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:24,875
- Tomorrow...
- Bye.

202
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,875
Don't worry, Mom. I'm used to it.

203
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,375
Him? No.

204
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:39,041
- I'm not worried about him.
- Who then?

205
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:42,333
Your sister.

206
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,041
What happened?

207
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:47,333
She's going to Paris for Christmas.

208
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:49,416
What a bitch.

209
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,250
I wouldn't use that word.
But you're right.

210
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
And now what?

211
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:57,000
What do you mean?

212
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,583
She won't be there for Christmas.

213
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,708
And I was also invited somewhere, so...

214
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:05,416
- What? Who...
- I'll go. See you later.

215
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,791
But I'll be there with Mom and Grandma.
You know...

216
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:09,833
Right!

217
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:13,666
Why don't we have a nice Christmas dinner
on January 3rd or 4th?

218
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,166
Where are you going now?

219
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:18,416
Didn't you hear? I have the call.
I'll take my shirts.

220
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,500
Okay.

221
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:21,500
Bye, Mom.

222
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:23,083
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye.

223
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,375
Hold on...

224
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:30,000
Christmas is called off?

225
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:32,916
We'll have a nice dinner on January 3rd.

226
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,833
- So what?
- Christmas dinner on January 3rd?

227
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:39,000
After Christmas, lamb goes on sale.

228
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:41,083
They practically give it away.

229
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:44,875
Oh, come on.

230
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:08,958
- Damn, you suck.
- Please.

231
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:13,916
Look who's talking, walking around
like a clown in that sweater.

232
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,583
I gave it to him.

233
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:19,958
My dad got it in Lapland.

234
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:24,125
Well, okay.
It would fit perfectly in Lapland.

235
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:25,666
It's actually festive.

236
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,916
How's your dad?

237
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,958
Fine. He and his new girlfriend
travel a lot.

238
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:31,875
What about Carlo and Anna?

239
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:37,000
Dunno. They're upset
I'm not going home for Christmas.

240
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:40,000
Haven't heard from them in a week.
Never happened.

241
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,291
How are they?

242
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,791
I haven't heard from them either.

243
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:45,000
Really?

244
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:48,416
Come on, guys. It's not a big deal.

245
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,416
It is when it comes to them.

246
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,916
This has never happened before. It's odd.

247
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:55,541
Right?

248
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:59,666
Yeah.
I won't be there for Christmas either.

249
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:01,333
How come?

250
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:03,916
I have plans too...

251
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:10,291
No dice.

252
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:13,750
- Neither of them is answering.
- Call Grandma.

253
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,625
- Yes?
<i>- Hello?</i>

254
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:27,041
Grandma, it's Ale.
Were you sleeping? Did I bother you?

255
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:29,000
No, I wasn't.

256
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:31,000
And you are bothering me. What?

257
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,125
<i>Well...</i>

258
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:35,541
- I'm here with Emilio and...
<i>- Who gives a shit.</i>

259
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:39,708
Grandma, hi. We were wondering,
what's up with Mom and Dad?

260
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:43,791
They're not answering our calls.
Do you know if they're okay?

261
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:46,916
More than okay.
How would you feel in their place?

262
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,250
Old and bored?

263
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,125
Don't be an idiot.

264
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:54,166
I'm sure they're not bored
after what happened.

265
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:57,125
Why? What happened?

266
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,958
<i>That's weird.</i>

267
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:00,541
They didn't tell you?

268
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:02,916
Aunt Tea's inheritance.

269
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,250
<i>Your mom was so kind to her.
She really deserved it.</i>

270
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,916
- Who the fuck is Aunt Tea?
- What did they get?

271
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,166
I don't know how much, but a lot.

272
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,083
Bye, sweetie.

273
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:17,500
Bye.

274
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:22,500
The old fart from Ceccano.

275
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,625
Huh?

276
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:33,375
PROMETHEUS

277
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:39,291
Nope, they're not answering.

278
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:42,375
Neither phone calls nor messages. Nothing.

279
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:44,458
- Who?
- My parents.

280
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:47,500
They're usually like leeches, but now...

281
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:51,458
Are your folks also clinging
as if you were ten?

282
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:55,166
My parents died when I was 12.

283
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:58,583
I miss them terribly.

284
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,500
I'm sorry.

285
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:05,166
Keep calling them...

286
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:08,500
while they're still alive.

287
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,250
You really worked on it all night?

288
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:17,958
Till 6:00 a.m.

289
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:21,750
You must have fallen asleep
around 2:30 a.m.

290
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:24,333
and had a nightmare
where you were an asshole.

291
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:29,166
Then you suddenly woke up
and your nightmare is here, down on paper.

292
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,041
Am I right?

293
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:36,833
Do it again by tomorrow.
Will you wake the fuck up?

294
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:44,541
- I can't take much more of this.
- Yeah.

295
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:48,166
If I were ever put in the Emilio zone,
I'd cut and run too.

296
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:51,208
- There are limits.
- What's the Emilio zone?

297
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:56,166
It's just... something Marzio came up with.

298
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:57,750
It's...

299
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:00,416
Yeah, I get it.

300
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:14,291
You bastard!

301
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,916
What?

302
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,041
What you said?

303
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:21,375
"Let's go tomorrow. I'm working tonight."

304
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:23,458
I got off earlier. What about you?

305
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:25,500
Because my brother is an asshole.

306
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:26,416
Cut it out.

307
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:28,833
Move.

308
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:35,208
Please let's not mention
the inheritance thing.

309
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:37,458
- Let them tell us.
- Why?

310
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:39,750
'Cause they'll think we're here for that.

311
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:49,458
- Hi.
- Hi.

312
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:50,875
What a surprise.

313
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:54,041
You haven't been picking up.

314
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:55,333
We came to see you.

315
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:56,916
- You vanished.
- Nonsense.

316
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,041
- Hi.
- Mom.

317
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:02,583
- What were you guys doing?
- I was preparing dinner.

318
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:07,375
Do you want to stay?

319
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:11,625
- Sure, if you don't mind.
- Of course not.

320
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:14,291
I happen to have some wine with me.

321
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,375
Was it easy to get here?

322
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:19,375
- What do you mean?
- You remembered the address?

323
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:22,875
- Very funny.
- She said... okay.

324
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:25,500
I'm sorry, though.

325
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:28,166
I wasn't prepared, and I only have this.

326
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,125
Are you kidding? That's plenty.

327
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:31,791
- Don't worry.
- Not really.

328
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,875
It looks so good. What is it?

329
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:37,125
It's an offal pie.

330
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:41,583
It's filled with chunks of heart,
liver, tripe,

331
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:46,166
along with the comb and wattle.
Would you like some?

332
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,875
Yes, sure.

333
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
You're no longer vegan?

334
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:53,708
Yes, but on special occasions...

335
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:56,750
- For your brother.
- Sure.

336
00:21:57,791 --> 00:22:00,208
Taste this wine. The guy at the wine shop

337
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:02,958
said it won Bottle of the Year in Abruzzo.

338
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:05,125
- Seriously?
- Try it.

339
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,875
How is it?

340
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:10,458
It's shit.

341
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:14,583
Kidding. It's good, full-bodied.

342
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:15,583
Full-bodied...

343
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:17,750
- Thanks.
- How are things with Rocco?

344
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:20,125
Fine, as usual.

345
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:24,833
Are you gonna add anything to your life
to make things less usual?

346
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:28,000
You know Alessandra
hates talking about such things.

347
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:29,250
No, Dad.

348
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:33,708
I don't mind.
I want to discuss these things with you.

349
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:39,125
Although...
having kids is expensive nowadays.

350
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:42,875
Very expensive.

351
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:45,833
- Emilio, what are you up to?
- Me?

352
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:48,166
I work all the time.

353
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:50,708
Not that I enjoy it.

354
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,416
But someone has to pay the rent.

355
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:57,125
Money doesn't grow on trees.

356
00:22:57,875 --> 00:22:58,833
It doesn't.

357
00:23:04,791 --> 00:23:05,791
How about you?

358
00:23:06,625 --> 00:23:08,291
Fine. We're fine.

359
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,583
All good.

360
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:17,916
I'm not going to Paris.

361
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,541
My Christmas trip was canceled.

362
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:22,750
I'll be with you.

363
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:25,041
- Great!
- Really?

364
00:23:25,666 --> 00:23:27,875
- Me too.
- Really?

365
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:29,083
You too?

366
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:31,458
Not because of a cancellation.

367
00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:34,208
I decided to spend Christmas with you.

368
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:36,583
I may be immature,

369
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:39,708
but I can't cut
the umbilical cord with Mom.

370
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:41,250
The umbilical cord...

371
00:23:42,416 --> 00:23:46,833
That's so... creepy, you know? It's...

372
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:49,208
Shut up and eat your comb.

373
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:55,125
- The offal is indigestible.
- Thanks.

374
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:57,666
- It made me sleepy.
- It was delicious.

375
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:00,208
- It was a great evening. Thank you.
- Bye.

376
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:02,750
- Good night. Bye.
- Thank you again.

377
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:04,458
- Talk to you tomorrow.
- Yes.

378
00:24:04,541 --> 00:24:05,458
- All right.
- Okay.

379
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:07,375
- Bye. Come on, it's cold.
- Bye.

380
00:24:07,458 --> 00:24:10,250
- Bye.
- Oh, I was wondering.

381
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:15,291
How was Aunt Tea's funeral?
So sorry I couldn't go.

382
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:19,541
It was so moving. All her relatives
were there except you guys.

383
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:23,375
When I found out,
I got this pain in my chest,

384
00:24:23,458 --> 00:24:26,125
and I just couldn't make it.

385
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:29,291
Me too. Even if we didn't see her much,

386
00:24:29,375 --> 00:24:31,250
I really loved her.

387
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:34,250
Yes, I was also very close to Aunt Tea.

388
00:24:37,625 --> 00:24:39,875
We forgot to tell you.

389
00:24:39,958 --> 00:24:42,208
She left us a little inheritance.

390
00:24:42,291 --> 00:24:43,375
Little? Huge.

391
00:24:45,125 --> 00:24:47,208
- Is that so?
- How much?

392
00:24:47,291 --> 00:24:49,666
- Six million.
- Six million. Six...

393
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:54,625
Well, not bad.

394
00:24:54,708 --> 00:24:56,208
There's worse.

395
00:24:58,875 --> 00:25:02,458
Six million is a lot of money to spend.
It takes effort...

396
00:25:02,541 --> 00:25:05,166
It is indeed. We might donate it.

397
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:07,166
Aunt Tea was so generous.

398
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:10,125
She'd be happy if we gave it to the needy.

399
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:11,208
I'm needy.

400
00:25:11,291 --> 00:25:13,208
- There's no rush.
- Just kidding.

401
00:25:13,291 --> 00:25:16,625
- It's safe in the bank for now.
- All right. Bye, kids.

402
00:25:16,708 --> 00:25:18,083
Bye. I'm getting cold.

403
00:25:18,166 --> 00:25:20,666
- Maybe see you tomorrow...
- Bye.

404
00:25:35,875 --> 00:25:36,791
See?

405
00:25:46,333 --> 00:25:48,333
- Enough!
- Shut up!

406
00:26:10,166 --> 00:26:11,500
To six million.

407
00:26:12,083 --> 00:26:13,083
Not bad, huh?

408
00:26:13,666 --> 00:26:17,000
Do you realize I can say goodbye
to this shitty life?

409
00:26:18,791 --> 00:26:19,958
Your life with me?

410
00:26:20,916 --> 00:26:24,916
No, baby, it's not about you.
I mean my job.

411
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,500
You work with me.

412
00:26:29,791 --> 00:26:32,708
Yes, but now I can figure out

413
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:35,041
what I really want to do with my life.

414
00:26:35,125 --> 00:26:36,791
Not worrying about money.

415
00:26:36,875 --> 00:26:37,875
You're right.

416
00:26:37,958 --> 00:26:40,750
Maybe you should do it
regardless of the money.

417
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:42,958
The money belongs to your parents.

418
00:26:49,333 --> 00:26:50,625
What a drag!

419
00:26:51,625 --> 00:26:53,833
Why are you such a pain in the ass?

420
00:26:53,916 --> 00:26:55,875
You could have just said,

421
00:26:55,958 --> 00:26:57,958
"Six million! Wow, let's fuck!"

422
00:26:58,541 --> 00:26:59,416
No.

423
00:27:02,166 --> 00:27:03,958
- Will it still count now?
- No.

424
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,875
Another round!

425
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:11,666
Emilio!

426
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:13,291
Marzio, no!

427
00:27:13,375 --> 00:27:15,833
Marzio pays for himself!

428
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,250
Pay up. You see this, Marzio?

429
00:27:21,333 --> 00:27:25,250
This is the new Emilio zone,
and you are banned!

430
00:27:26,708 --> 00:27:28,875
A toast to Aunt Tea!

431
00:27:28,958 --> 00:27:30,541
To Aunt Tea!

432
00:27:30,625 --> 00:27:36,208
Aunt Tea!

433
00:27:36,291 --> 00:27:38,208
They don't want to be around us.

434
00:27:38,791 --> 00:27:39,875
Since when?

435
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:43,000
I didn't notice while it was happening.

436
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,750
We used to do so many things together.

437
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:51,625
Do you remember Greece?
The four of us in a tent...

438
00:27:54,208 --> 00:27:56,500
You and I can also do things together.

439
00:27:56,583 --> 00:27:57,708
Like what?

440
00:27:58,583 --> 00:28:00,541
Undressed, lying down...

441
00:28:01,041 --> 00:28:02,000
A CAT scan?

442
00:28:03,083 --> 00:28:04,458
So demeaning.

443
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,958
Look, Carlo, I'm not in the mood
to celebrate anything.

444
00:28:09,041 --> 00:28:10,791
Last time we did it was a year ago,

445
00:28:10,875 --> 00:28:12,500
on All Souls' Day.

446
00:28:12,583 --> 00:28:14,375
Just a year?

447
00:28:14,958 --> 00:28:19,625
My performance was remarkable.
Turgid and never-ending.

448
00:28:23,416 --> 00:28:24,958
Anyway, you were right.

449
00:28:25,041 --> 00:28:25,916
About what?

450
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,125
That they'd show up because of the money.

451
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:32,500
Imagine when we tell them we made it up.

452
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,500
They'll be gone for good.

453
00:28:34,583 --> 00:28:38,833
- So be it. They're assholes.
- I know. You're right.

454
00:28:40,958 --> 00:28:43,083
But we'll spend Christmas together.

455
00:28:43,166 --> 00:28:46,708
Yes. One last Christmas,
the four of us together.

456
00:28:51,375 --> 00:28:52,750
A message from Emilio.

457
00:28:53,458 --> 00:28:55,875
"Mom, Dad, I love you."

458
00:28:56,708 --> 00:29:00,208
- Honey, you know...
- They're assholes.

459
00:29:00,291 --> 00:29:03,791
But... it still feels nice, you know?

460
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:11,541
How can we make them think
we're millionaires?

461
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:14,125
- Don't worry. I have a plan.
- What plan?

462
00:29:14,208 --> 00:29:15,125
You'll see.

463
00:29:16,708 --> 00:29:18,708
- This one?
- Maybe this one.

464
00:29:19,833 --> 00:29:23,041
- This is flashy.
- What about this one?

465
00:29:31,375 --> 00:29:32,583
- Well?
- Beautiful.

466
00:29:32,666 --> 00:29:33,791
How much is it?

467
00:29:49,125 --> 00:29:50,625
Goodness.

468
00:29:56,625 --> 00:29:57,625
Not bad!

469
00:30:05,916 --> 00:30:07,833
- Can I get in?
- Sure.

470
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:18,833
How does it feel?

471
00:30:18,916 --> 00:30:23,041
You'll need a water pump
to get me out of here. But it's divine.

472
00:30:23,833 --> 00:30:25,458
How long do you want to rent it?

473
00:30:27,041 --> 00:30:28,458
Until Christmas.

474
00:30:28,541 --> 00:30:29,541
Okay.

475
00:30:29,625 --> 00:30:32,375
What about insurance?

476
00:30:32,458 --> 00:30:36,041
If you mess it up,
I'll feed your balls to the dog.

477
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:38,875
Said the marquis to the count.

478
00:30:38,958 --> 00:30:40,958
That's a high deductible.

479
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:47,000
You're supposed to be in Amsterdam
from Thursday to Monday.

480
00:30:47,083 --> 00:30:49,000
Fine. No problem.

481
00:30:49,583 --> 00:30:53,083
Yes? Good. Come in.

482
00:30:53,666 --> 00:30:55,791
- No problem at all.
- Here?

483
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:58,083
Thank you.

484
00:30:58,958 --> 00:31:01,416
- How are things?
- What things?

485
00:31:02,291 --> 00:31:03,125
How are you?

486
00:31:03,208 --> 00:31:05,250
I'm fine, thanks.

487
00:31:06,541 --> 00:31:10,208
I noticed you've been changing
for the better lately.

488
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,291
It was hard to do worse...

489
00:31:14,458 --> 00:31:17,041
I take partial credit for this.

490
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:21,541
If it hadn't been
for my daily injections of frustration,

491
00:31:22,916 --> 00:31:25,250
you wouldn't have improved, right?

492
00:31:25,875 --> 00:31:26,708
I don't know.

493
00:31:26,791 --> 00:31:28,708
I do know. That's not the point.

494
00:31:28,791 --> 00:31:31,750
Now that you've finally blossomed,

495
00:31:31,833 --> 00:31:34,750
I can offer you a position as...

496
00:31:36,416 --> 00:31:37,500
partner.

497
00:31:38,541 --> 00:31:40,041
What do you think?

498
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,875
- Are you serious?
- I am.

499
00:31:43,958 --> 00:31:45,583
No more dicking you around.

500
00:31:47,291 --> 00:31:48,458
From now on,

501
00:31:48,541 --> 00:31:51,708
we dick around with the others,
if you want.

502
00:31:51,791 --> 00:31:52,625
Am I right?

503
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,916
Why not?

504
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,125
Obviously, you'll have to invest
a small sum

505
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:02,375
to enter as a partner
as I did when I joined.

506
00:32:02,458 --> 00:32:03,875
Right.

507
00:32:03,958 --> 00:32:05,500
Because I know...

508
00:32:06,875 --> 00:32:08,083
I mean, I heard...

509
00:32:13,333 --> 00:32:15,750
Rumor has it you have the means now.

510
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:17,666
- So...
- I get it.

511
00:32:18,625 --> 00:32:21,958
But it's not my money. It's my father's.

512
00:32:22,041 --> 00:32:26,541
He's a very restrained person,
to say the least.

513
00:32:27,166 --> 00:32:30,541
The kind of person
who puts money under his mattress.

514
00:32:38,916 --> 00:32:42,083
Guess he pulled something out
from under his mattress.

515
00:32:47,416 --> 00:32:48,250
Jeez.

516
00:32:49,041 --> 00:32:49,916
Holy shit.

517
00:32:55,375 --> 00:32:56,500
Come on down!

518
00:33:04,958 --> 00:33:06,416
I can't believe it!

519
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,750
Believe it.

520
00:33:07,833 --> 00:33:08,666
Is it yours?

521
00:33:09,375 --> 00:33:11,541
- Let me try.
- Hell, no.

522
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:14,708
- One joyride!
- Okay, get in. I'll drive.

523
00:33:14,791 --> 00:33:15,875
Look at that.

524
00:33:16,791 --> 00:33:18,500
Don't hump my Ferrari!

525
00:33:18,583 --> 00:33:19,791
Stop being an oaf.

526
00:33:19,875 --> 00:33:24,291
Everybody's watching.
We're making assholes of ourselves.

527
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,250
- Don't touch. You'll ruin it. It's new.
- Ruin it?

528
00:33:45,333 --> 00:33:46,208
Yeah.

529
00:33:52,958 --> 00:33:54,625
Would you call back at 3:00?

530
00:33:54,708 --> 00:33:57,000
Okay? Good.

531
00:33:57,083 --> 00:33:58,541
Thank you so much.

532
00:34:00,166 --> 00:34:03,500
I told you already.
You can only have one lollipop.

533
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:04,833
That's your third.

534
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,041
Oh my God, Mom.

535
00:34:15,125 --> 00:34:18,166
- What are you wearing?
- It's snakeskin.

536
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:19,875
It's super soft. Touch it.

537
00:34:19,958 --> 00:34:21,458
No. I can imagine.

538
00:34:22,166 --> 00:34:24,500
€4,000.

539
00:34:27,375 --> 00:34:30,375
I saw an ad for an apartment for sale.

540
00:34:30,458 --> 00:34:31,625
It's mind-blowing.

541
00:34:31,708 --> 00:34:34,708
Have you decided to invest?

542
00:34:34,791 --> 00:34:35,666
No.

543
00:34:36,583 --> 00:34:38,083
It'd be more like a gift.

544
00:34:38,166 --> 00:34:39,666
You'd love it.

545
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,250
You want to come with me?

546
00:34:42,333 --> 00:34:45,541
Yes, sure. Gladly.

547
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:48,041
I mean... you guys can handle things.

548
00:34:48,125 --> 00:34:48,958
You guys?

549
00:34:49,541 --> 00:34:50,500
I mean you.

550
00:34:51,416 --> 00:34:55,166
Do you expect me to do fillings
from the front desk?

551
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:57,791
Yes, great idea. Bye.

552
00:34:59,083 --> 00:34:59,916
Bye.

553
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:05,833
My boss invited me
to play golf next Saturday.

554
00:35:05,916 --> 00:35:08,166
He'd like you to come as well.

555
00:35:08,916 --> 00:35:10,083
He barely knows me.

556
00:35:10,166 --> 00:35:12,500
It's a chance to get to know you.

557
00:35:12,583 --> 00:35:15,666
- I don't know how to play though.
- No worries.

558
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:18,666
We'll just walk around the grass
and hang out.

559
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:19,583
Like so.

560
00:35:20,291 --> 00:35:21,125
Listen.

561
00:35:22,041 --> 00:35:23,458
Take this check.

562
00:35:25,958 --> 00:35:29,083
Put it in the glove compartment.
I don't want to carry it.

563
00:35:29,791 --> 00:35:31,750
It's for the World Wildlife Fund.

564
00:35:31,833 --> 00:35:36,625
Mom and I are trying to save an island
where six kanaroos live.

565
00:35:36,708 --> 00:35:37,875
What are kanaroos?

566
00:35:37,958 --> 00:35:39,958
"What are kanaroos?"

567
00:35:40,041 --> 00:35:43,333
An endangered species of seal
living in the Galápagos.

568
00:35:43,416 --> 00:35:45,791
- €70,000 for kanaroos?
- Yes, 70,000.

569
00:35:45,875 --> 00:35:48,000
That's so heartbreaking.

570
00:35:48,708 --> 00:35:51,000
Mom's gone on a charity kick.

571
00:35:51,083 --> 00:35:53,125
She's an angel.

572
00:35:54,333 --> 00:35:57,541
- What's wrong?
- The car is rebelling.

573
00:36:00,666 --> 00:36:03,375
And this is the terrace,
spacious and quiet.

574
00:36:05,208 --> 00:36:08,416
Our gardeners
took care of the grounds before.

575
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,625
Just give us a call
and they'll be happy to come.

576
00:36:12,541 --> 00:36:14,333
- It's gorgeous.
- It is.

577
00:36:14,416 --> 00:36:16,458
How many people would live here?

578
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:18,416
Well, two...

579
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:21,125
maybe three.

580
00:36:21,208 --> 00:36:22,750
Four, five?

581
00:36:22,833 --> 00:36:24,708
Excuse me.

582
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:26,250
Hello?

583
00:36:28,791 --> 00:36:31,916
- Do you like it?
- It's beautiful.

584
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,750
It's really lovely. And huge.

585
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:40,291
Can you imagine living here?

586
00:36:43,083 --> 00:36:46,166
Listen, I wanted to tell you
that I quit smoking.

587
00:36:46,666 --> 00:36:48,958
I'm so glad to hear that. Good.

588
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,833
But most of all,

589
00:36:53,625 --> 00:36:55,333
I stopped taking the pill.

590
00:36:56,416 --> 00:36:58,041
- You did?
- Yes.

591
00:36:58,125 --> 00:36:59,333
Honey.

592
00:37:00,083 --> 00:37:02,666
- Since when?
- Today.

593
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:06,541
I decided that I'll focus
on doing things right.

594
00:37:07,166 --> 00:37:08,000
Yeah.

595
00:37:09,208 --> 00:37:10,833
Look.

596
00:37:12,041 --> 00:37:12,958
Wow.

597
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:18,375
This will be useful for physiotherapy.

598
00:37:18,958 --> 00:37:22,583
We'll put handrails in,
otherwise the elderly will get hurt.

599
00:37:25,833 --> 00:37:29,208
- What elderly?
- The ones that will come to live here.

600
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:33,250
Yes. I'm taking over
the initiative Aunt Tea had

601
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:34,750
with this organization.

602
00:37:35,708 --> 00:37:39,125
They give free housing
to needy old people.

603
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:42,250
Lonely people neglected by their family.

604
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:44,583
Really, Mom?

605
00:37:45,208 --> 00:37:49,958
You can't imagine how many asshole kids
abandon their parents.

606
00:37:51,708 --> 00:37:53,125
That's so sad.

607
00:38:00,958 --> 00:38:05,875
PIERO'S TRATTORIA

608
00:38:05,958 --> 00:38:07,791
You should've seen her face

609
00:38:07,875 --> 00:38:11,083
when I said the pool was for the elderly.

610
00:38:12,875 --> 00:38:14,291
You guys are monsters.

611
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,333
Us? They're the monsters, Mom.

612
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:20,666
They've been treating her
like shit for years.

613
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:22,333
Both of us.

614
00:38:22,416 --> 00:38:24,333
But you're the one who's upset.

615
00:38:28,041 --> 00:38:29,750
It's Alessandra.

616
00:38:32,458 --> 00:38:34,041
Honey? Hi.

617
00:38:36,125 --> 00:38:38,958
I'm in the oratory with Father Ciro.

618
00:38:39,041 --> 00:38:44,291
I'm giving him a check
for his mission in Nigeria.

619
00:38:45,083 --> 00:38:48,291
Sure, where? Shedo?

620
00:38:49,166 --> 00:38:50,916
Of course, yes.

621
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,416
If it has no Michelin star,
I won't even sit, you know?

622
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,583
See you tomorrow.

623
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:56,916
Bye.

624
00:38:58,166 --> 00:39:00,833
"With no Michelin star I don't sit."
So tacky.

625
00:39:01,416 --> 00:39:03,541
You've gone too far.

626
00:39:03,625 --> 00:39:06,416
Revenge is like getting drunk.

627
00:39:07,125 --> 00:39:09,541
Once you decide to stop, you can't.

628
00:39:09,625 --> 00:39:13,375
That's because getting drunk
feels so good, Mom.

629
00:39:13,458 --> 00:39:14,291
Cheers.

630
00:39:18,666 --> 00:39:19,916
Hi, Lori.

631
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,208
- Hi.
- Hi.

632
00:39:21,291 --> 00:39:23,375
I'm going downtown to eat with Ale.

633
00:39:23,458 --> 00:39:24,875
It sounds good.

634
00:39:24,958 --> 00:39:27,166
And Carlo is playing golf with Emilio.

635
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:31,708
I'm going to swing some sticks around,
as they say in golf lingo.

636
00:39:31,791 --> 00:39:34,250
They've come around more often lately.

637
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:36,041
They're like leeches.

638
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,708
But we're having fun.

639
00:39:38,791 --> 00:39:42,583
We're going to the city.
Having the usual lunch at home

640
00:39:42,666 --> 00:39:45,125
was becoming a little boring.

641
00:39:45,208 --> 00:39:46,500
But then, of course,

642
00:39:47,708 --> 00:39:51,250
some people like it. Of course...

643
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:54,958
Yeah...

644
00:39:56,458 --> 00:39:57,833
You're doing the limbo?

645
00:39:58,791 --> 00:40:01,500
I told him to get an SUV!

646
00:40:01,583 --> 00:40:04,541
If I have to lay down,
I'd rather stay home on the couch.

647
00:40:04,625 --> 00:40:07,958
But men turn into children
when it comes to cars.

648
00:40:08,041 --> 00:40:12,333
Vincenzo's not fond of cars.
He couldn't care less.

649
00:40:13,375 --> 00:40:16,875
Good thing. With your Polish minivan,

650
00:40:16,958 --> 00:40:18,916
he'd have killed himself.

651
00:40:20,375 --> 00:40:22,500
Honey, you're becoming a boor.

652
00:40:24,375 --> 00:40:25,375
Bye.

653
00:40:34,541 --> 00:40:36,625
- Here is your table.
- Thank you.

654
00:40:42,583 --> 00:40:44,208
Would you care for a drink?

655
00:40:44,291 --> 00:40:45,125
Yes.

656
00:40:45,958 --> 00:40:48,458
Dom Pérignon for two, <i>s'il vous plaît.</i>

657
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:50,583
Why not.

658
00:40:51,791 --> 00:40:52,958
Let's celebrate.

659
00:40:58,416 --> 00:40:59,416
What's wrong?

660
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:04,500
It's been a long time
since we did something together.

661
00:41:04,583 --> 00:41:05,416
The two of us.

662
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,916
Nonsense.

663
00:41:07,625 --> 00:41:08,458
It's true.

664
00:41:16,625 --> 00:41:18,750
I promise we'll do it more often.

665
00:41:21,333 --> 00:41:22,166
I hope so.

666
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:35,958
What's wrong?

667
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:37,875
Huh?

668
00:41:38,416 --> 00:41:42,000
Sometimes you look like a pigeon.
A dumb pigeon

669
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:44,250
who wants to say something but can't.

670
00:41:44,791 --> 00:41:46,250
- A pigeon?
- He's here.

671
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:48,291
Dad! We're here.

672
00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:51,833
Let me handle it. I'll fool him.

673
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:55,375
- That's my dad we're talking about.
- I know.

674
00:41:55,458 --> 00:41:58,041
I mean in a good way.
He'll make good money.

675
00:41:59,333 --> 00:42:02,250
Anyway, I said I'll fool him,
not screw him.

676
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:04,583
I hope not.

677
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:07,625
- Hello. Sorry I'm late.
- Hello.

678
00:42:07,708 --> 00:42:09,875
- No worries.
- You remember my boss?

679
00:42:09,958 --> 00:42:11,958
No bosses. Azeglio de Frescobaldi.

680
00:42:12,041 --> 00:42:14,041
- A pleasure.
- Call me de Frescobaldi.

681
00:42:14,125 --> 00:42:16,708
Carlo Delle Fave. Call me Delle Fave.

682
00:42:17,416 --> 00:42:20,750
You laugh? You're a Delle Fave too.
It's nice here.

683
00:42:20,833 --> 00:42:22,000
- You like it?
- Yes.

684
00:42:27,291 --> 00:42:29,875
Millet tacos with celeriac purée.

685
00:42:29,958 --> 00:42:31,708
Asparagus from Cantello.

686
00:42:33,541 --> 00:42:34,625
Cantello.

687
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:39,166
{\an8}Marinated pumpkin tartar
with garlic cuts and pink grapefruit.

688
00:42:40,375 --> 00:42:43,083
{\an8}Beetroot crackers with cucumber mousse.

689
00:42:44,541 --> 00:42:47,125
{\an8}Glasswort salad with raspberry cream.

690
00:42:47,208 --> 00:42:50,000
{\an8}Smoked potato spaghetti.

691
00:42:50,083 --> 00:42:51,583
{\an8}Cherry tomato pesto.

692
00:42:51,666 --> 00:42:54,250
{\an8}Marjoram pesto, tarte tatin. Dessert Pop.

693
00:42:54,333 --> 00:42:56,791
{\an8}New York-style. An homage to Andy Warhol.

694
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:00,458
Here you go.

695
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:03,416
- Did you enjoy it?
- We did, thank you.

696
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:04,541
Yes, thank you.

697
00:43:10,041 --> 00:43:11,416
What can I say?

698
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:12,541
Thanks.

699
00:43:12,625 --> 00:43:13,916
- Thank you.
- No.

700
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,500
I'm the one thanking you.

701
00:43:16,583 --> 00:43:19,166
We can do it again, if you want.

702
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:21,000
Any time.

703
00:43:21,083 --> 00:43:24,208
Plus, we don't go out to eat that often,

704
00:43:24,291 --> 00:43:27,208
so we may as well live it up
and spare no expense.

705
00:43:28,708 --> 00:43:30,041
I'm going to the restroom.

706
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:33,541
I don't want to see how much you'll pay.

707
00:43:34,291 --> 00:43:35,541
I might faint.

708
00:43:36,541 --> 00:43:37,625
Thank you, honey.

709
00:43:56,041 --> 00:43:58,958
- What a great shot. Fantastic.
- Bravo!

710
00:43:59,041 --> 00:44:01,041
- Are you surprised?
- Bravo!

711
00:44:02,208 --> 00:44:04,625
Emilio told me you received a nice...

712
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:08,208
and unexpected gift from life.

713
00:44:08,291 --> 00:44:10,166
From death, rather.

714
00:44:10,666 --> 00:44:12,458
Right. Same thing, though.

715
00:44:12,541 --> 00:44:15,958
Life or death,
someone has to cough up the dough.

716
00:44:18,583 --> 00:44:20,625
Anyway, we can discuss it later.

717
00:44:20,708 --> 00:44:24,625
Because I think
if that gift is left there unopened,

718
00:44:25,583 --> 00:44:27,250
it's as useless as a limp dick.

719
00:44:27,333 --> 00:44:28,458
Am I right?

720
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:29,958
You're a poet.

721
00:44:31,208 --> 00:44:32,125
Take your shot.

722
00:44:32,208 --> 00:44:33,916
Thanks. I'm not good at it.

723
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,291
You are. It's easy. I'll show you.

724
00:44:36,375 --> 00:44:38,166
He's a real dickhead.

725
00:44:42,666 --> 00:44:43,750
Excuse me.

726
00:44:45,333 --> 00:44:47,250
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

727
00:44:48,333 --> 00:44:49,500
Listen.

728
00:44:49,583 --> 00:44:52,708
By any chance,
may I pay with meal vouchers?

729
00:44:52,791 --> 00:44:54,000
No.

730
00:44:54,083 --> 00:44:55,375
Of course not.

731
00:44:55,875 --> 00:44:58,291
I would've needed 300 of them, so...

732
00:44:59,666 --> 00:45:01,875
All right. I'll pay by check.

733
00:45:02,625 --> 00:45:04,125
- Relax.
- I'm relaxed.

734
00:45:04,208 --> 00:45:05,958
Relax your legs.

735
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:10,833
- Move your pelvis a bit more.
- I heard you! Why won't he let go of me?

736
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:14,000
Like I said, about that gift,

737
00:45:14,083 --> 00:45:16,000
if it's a pre-death donation,

738
00:45:16,083 --> 00:45:18,083
tax conditions are much better.

739
00:45:18,166 --> 00:45:21,458
Parent-children relationships
are also better pre-death.

740
00:45:28,791 --> 00:45:30,541
God, did I hurt you?

741
00:45:31,208 --> 00:45:32,041
Huh?

742
00:45:36,666 --> 00:45:37,625
Look.

743
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:40,041
You clobbered me.

744
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:43,958
Come on. I'm almost done.

745
00:45:45,333 --> 00:45:48,833
Next week,
I'll put in the temporary implants.

746
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,125
And then the permanent ones.

747
00:45:55,541 --> 00:45:57,583
We need to talk to Mom and Dad.

748
00:45:58,250 --> 00:45:59,166
What?

749
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:02,750
We need to talk to Mom and Dad.

750
00:46:02,833 --> 00:46:04,541
They're squandering everything.

751
00:46:04,625 --> 00:46:08,333
The Ferrari, the fucking charity.
We'll have nothing left.

752
00:46:08,916 --> 00:46:10,958
It's still their money, isn't it?

753
00:46:11,041 --> 00:46:13,375
Yes, but it's six million.

754
00:46:13,458 --> 00:46:16,041
Not even one euro for their needy kids?

755
00:46:16,125 --> 00:46:18,666
Do you know what I can do
with two million?

756
00:46:20,166 --> 00:46:21,916
Why two million?

757
00:46:23,208 --> 00:46:26,041
Two for me, two for Emilio,
and two for them.

758
00:46:26,125 --> 00:46:27,625
A couple counts as one.

759
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:30,333
Wait.

760
00:46:32,083 --> 00:46:33,583
- It's Mom.
- Pick up.

761
00:46:34,083 --> 00:46:35,041
I am already.

762
00:46:36,166 --> 00:46:39,208
- Hello?
<i>- Hi. How's Emilio?</i>

763
00:46:39,291 --> 00:46:41,833
- Like shit.
- He's in pain.

764
00:46:41,916 --> 00:46:44,166
He's very shaken too.

765
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:45,708
<i>Dad feels so guilty.</i>

766
00:46:45,791 --> 00:46:49,791
Rightfully. He already struggled
to socialize before, poor thing.

767
00:46:49,875 --> 00:46:52,625
- Let alone now, without teeth.
- What the fuck?

768
00:46:52,708 --> 00:46:56,000
<i>Listen, Dad and I want to see you both.</i>

769
00:46:56,083 --> 00:46:59,166
<i>How about lunch at Piero's on Sunday?</i>

770
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:02,500
<i>We need to talk
about the inheritance and everything.</i>

771
00:47:02,583 --> 00:47:03,541
Okay.

772
00:47:04,041 --> 00:47:06,083
See you on Sunday then.

773
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:10,041
- Love you.
- Me too.

774
00:47:10,125 --> 00:47:11,791
- I love you more.
<i>- Bye.</i>

775
00:47:11,875 --> 00:47:12,791
Bye.

776
00:47:14,125 --> 00:47:15,583
- Finally.
- Yeah.

777
00:47:18,875 --> 00:47:20,875
I'm returning the car after lunch.

778
00:47:20,958 --> 00:47:22,958
Maybe I'll let Emilio drive.

779
00:47:23,041 --> 00:47:24,375
It'll sugarcoat it.

780
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,541
We should've waited till Christmas.

781
00:47:27,625 --> 00:47:30,541
Emilio's boss was on my back
for money the other day.

782
00:47:30,625 --> 00:47:33,458
I didn't know what do to.
I can't handle it anymore.

783
00:47:34,375 --> 00:47:35,750
How do we tell them?

784
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:38,791
Plain and simple.

785
00:47:38,875 --> 00:47:42,500
"Nothing is true. It was a prank."
We didn't kill anyone.

786
00:47:43,583 --> 00:47:46,583
We need to have a serious talk,
as a family.

787
00:47:46,666 --> 00:47:49,041
They can't still treat us as a doormat.

788
00:47:49,125 --> 00:47:51,666
"Pay for this! Wash this! You're old!"

789
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:52,583
Yeah.

790
00:47:52,666 --> 00:47:53,708
They're here.

791
00:47:56,291 --> 00:47:57,791
You smashed his face.

792
00:47:57,875 --> 00:48:00,500
Oh, please. It's barely noticeable.

793
00:48:00,583 --> 00:48:01,916
- Hi.
- Honey.

794
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:02,916
Your teeth?

795
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,625
Rocco'll put in temporary implants
in two days.

796
00:48:06,375 --> 00:48:08,875
- I'm so sorry.
- It's fine.

797
00:48:08,958 --> 00:48:09,833
What the...

798
00:48:09,916 --> 00:48:12,291
This game of golf is a fools' game.

799
00:48:12,375 --> 00:48:16,291
With those iron sticks,
if you smack someone in the face, then...

800
00:48:18,291 --> 00:48:19,250
someone gets hurt.

801
00:48:20,916 --> 00:48:22,541
Giulia, we're ready.

802
00:48:26,583 --> 00:48:29,791
Four portions of linguine Piero-style
to start, okay?

803
00:48:29,875 --> 00:48:31,041
- Yes.
- Perfect.

804
00:48:31,125 --> 00:48:32,000
Thank you.

805
00:48:36,708 --> 00:48:37,583
You talk.

806
00:48:38,125 --> 00:48:39,708
Me? Not you?

807
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:42,750
You're better at this maternal stuff.

808
00:48:42,833 --> 00:48:44,000
Hell, no.

809
00:48:45,333 --> 00:48:46,416
Wow.

810
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:49,250
There's already an air of celebration.

811
00:48:49,333 --> 00:48:54,375
Yes, just a little gift.
It's a foretaste of Christmas.

812
00:48:54,458 --> 00:48:57,458
- Smells good.
- Suspense.

813
00:48:58,041 --> 00:49:01,125
The same amount for you both
so no one gets jealous.

814
00:49:01,208 --> 00:49:04,541
The ATM gave us different bills,
but the sum is the same.

815
00:49:10,083 --> 00:49:11,958
€150?

816
00:49:12,958 --> 00:49:13,958
Well, kids...

817
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:18,958
We played a prank on you.

818
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:22,875
That's why.

819
00:49:22,958 --> 00:49:25,875
These days we were saying,
"Damn, they're stingy."

820
00:49:25,958 --> 00:49:27,375
"All for themselves."

821
00:49:27,458 --> 00:49:28,666
Okay.

822
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:30,791
All joking aside for a moment,

823
00:49:30,875 --> 00:49:34,083
I want to open an account with my share.
Sound good?

824
00:49:37,958 --> 00:49:39,583
Maybe we weren't clear.

825
00:49:40,458 --> 00:49:41,833
We can only give you...

826
00:49:42,875 --> 00:49:43,833
this.

827
00:49:49,791 --> 00:49:50,625
What?

828
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:53,958
Let's go.

829
00:49:54,041 --> 00:49:55,000
Why?

830
00:49:55,958 --> 00:49:58,208
If I stay longer, I'll get pissed off.

831
00:49:58,291 --> 00:50:00,208
Hey! Watch it!

832
00:50:00,291 --> 00:50:03,625
- For real? €150? Keep it.
- How pathetic.

833
00:50:03,708 --> 00:50:04,916
You are pathetic.

834
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,041
You're being stinking skinflints
with your own kids.

835
00:50:08,125 --> 00:50:10,291
The kids who only show up for money?

836
00:50:10,375 --> 00:50:14,250
Enough with moral blackmail!
You could've helped us out.

837
00:50:14,333 --> 00:50:16,625
We've always done everything for you.

838
00:50:17,208 --> 00:50:18,375
Let's go.

839
00:50:18,458 --> 00:50:21,125
They can live like billionaires alone.

840
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,166
Better alone
than with two dickheads like you.

841
00:50:25,666 --> 00:50:27,333
I'll break his molars too.

842
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:37,916
We gave them everything.

843
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,958
Diapers, vacations, university.

844
00:50:41,041 --> 00:50:44,500
After all our sacrifices,
they dare to call me stingy.

845
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:48,541
We can't blame them.
They think we inherited six million.

846
00:50:49,208 --> 00:50:50,416
Is the money theirs?

847
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:54,666
No, but we could've given them
more than €150 for Christmas.

848
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:57,250
- You think?
- Yes, you are a bit stingy.

849
00:50:57,333 --> 00:51:00,125
Stingy? I'm just frugal. I'm not stingy.

850
00:51:00,916 --> 00:51:02,375
Emilio gets €2,000 per month,

851
00:51:02,458 --> 00:51:06,250
more than my pension.
She makes €1,000 by doing nothing.

852
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,916
Christmas without those two
will be a relief.

853
00:51:11,208 --> 00:51:12,041
Listen.

854
00:51:13,625 --> 00:51:16,250
Carlo, don't say it, even in jest.

855
00:51:16,333 --> 00:51:19,166
What a great idea you had.
You made a mess.

856
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:23,583
Me? I did it for you.
You kept obsessing over them.

857
00:51:23,666 --> 00:51:26,625
Couldn't you let it be
instead of playing the victim?

858
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:29,875
All this for this cursed Christmas
that haunts me!

859
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:38,958
Here's what we'll do.

860
00:51:39,041 --> 00:51:43,083
I'll talk to Emilio,
and you'll talk to Alessandra.

861
00:51:43,166 --> 00:51:45,916
We'll explain things calmly.
They'll understand.

862
00:51:46,875 --> 00:51:49,041
I don't want a Christmas without them.

863
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Man, what a pain in the ass.

864
00:51:55,041 --> 00:51:57,750
- I made him pay. Was I wrong?
- No.

865
00:51:57,833 --> 00:52:00,291
It was his fault. He pays up. Am I right?

866
00:52:01,708 --> 00:52:03,166
Thanks.

867
00:52:04,083 --> 00:52:07,250
Ezio, since all your colleagues hate you,
you wanna pay?

868
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:09,458
Maybe they'll like you more.

869
00:52:09,541 --> 00:52:10,500
Okay.

870
00:52:11,083 --> 00:52:11,916
Am I right?

871
00:52:12,791 --> 00:52:14,750
- Say thanks to Ezio.
- Thanks, Ezio.

872
00:52:14,833 --> 00:52:16,250
Thanks, Ezio.

873
00:52:29,916 --> 00:52:32,416
Why are you here?
I was going back to work.

874
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:34,000
Rocco fixed your teeth?

875
00:52:34,083 --> 00:52:36,875
Too bad. You were cute
talking like a hamster.

876
00:52:37,958 --> 00:52:39,125
What do you want?

877
00:52:39,708 --> 00:52:43,458
Nothing. I wanted to say hi
and make peace with you.

878
00:52:43,541 --> 00:52:44,500
Want to drive?

879
00:52:46,208 --> 00:52:49,541
- Don't throw me a bone.
- Come on, let's have a chat.

880
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:51,625
I have something to confess.

881
00:52:52,208 --> 00:52:54,750
Delle Fave. Hi.

882
00:52:54,833 --> 00:52:56,666
- All good?
- Yes. You vanished.

883
00:52:58,333 --> 00:53:01,166
It's a hard time,
I have many things to solve.

884
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:03,375
Right. You could've told me.

885
00:53:03,458 --> 00:53:05,541
I made you and Emilio a nice offer.

886
00:53:06,208 --> 00:53:09,208
I expected at least a yes or a no.
Just this...

887
00:53:10,333 --> 00:53:11,375
You're right.

888
00:53:11,458 --> 00:53:15,291
But expecting anything
from Emilio is fucking stupid.

889
00:53:15,375 --> 00:53:16,375
Am I right?

890
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:34,791
Honey?

891
00:53:35,666 --> 00:53:36,541
Will you open up?

892
00:53:36,625 --> 00:53:38,625
I don't want to see anyone.

893
00:53:40,208 --> 00:53:42,125
I have something to tell you.

894
00:53:42,208 --> 00:53:44,041
I brought you a gift.

895
00:53:44,125 --> 00:53:45,916
I don't want any gifts.

896
00:54:13,916 --> 00:54:15,750
Are you going away?

897
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,166
No, I'm moving out.

898
00:54:23,166 --> 00:54:24,458
What's happening?

899
00:54:25,458 --> 00:54:27,666
What's happening is that I'm a loser.

900
00:54:28,208 --> 00:54:29,375
No, you're not.

901
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,041
Yes, I am, Mom.

902
00:54:32,708 --> 00:54:33,958
Cut it out, honey.

903
00:54:41,375 --> 00:54:42,375
Will you help me?

904
00:54:48,833 --> 00:54:50,416
Try to sit on it.

905
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Ale.

906
00:55:03,041 --> 00:55:04,375
Rocco no longer loves me.

907
00:55:04,458 --> 00:55:07,833
In fact, now he despises me
because I argued with you.

908
00:55:08,375 --> 00:55:10,291
It looks like you all ganged up

909
00:55:10,375 --> 00:55:12,791
to make me feel that
I don't deserve anything.

910
00:55:17,041 --> 00:55:18,250
What's so important?

911
00:55:19,166 --> 00:55:20,000
Huh?

912
00:55:21,666 --> 00:55:24,625
You came
because you had something to tell me.

913
00:55:40,625 --> 00:55:42,958
- Goodness.
- Honey.

914
00:55:45,916 --> 00:55:48,208
- Hi.
- How did it go?

915
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:50,083
All set.

916
00:55:51,333 --> 00:55:53,166
How did he take it?

917
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:56,875
Well, we talked,
and we found common ground.

918
00:55:56,958 --> 00:55:59,666
We're all to blame in this mess, you know?

919
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:02,083
- Right.
- He's the first to admit it.

920
00:56:03,541 --> 00:56:07,625
I didn't tell him the inheritance
is a crock of shit though.

921
00:56:07,708 --> 00:56:08,791
What?

922
00:56:09,583 --> 00:56:12,625
We discussed our relationship,
which matters most.

923
00:56:12,708 --> 00:56:13,875
Sure, right.

924
00:56:13,958 --> 00:56:16,458
I'll give him €200,000 to be a partner.

925
00:56:19,458 --> 00:56:21,333
- Are you nuts?
- What?

926
00:56:21,416 --> 00:56:23,625
How will you get €200,000?

927
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:26,958
Fuck if I know!

928
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:32,666
Did you manage to tell Alessandra?

929
00:56:33,958 --> 00:56:35,791
- Yes...
- Hi, Dad.

930
00:56:37,083 --> 00:56:38,958
- Hi.
- Is dinner ready?

931
00:56:39,041 --> 00:56:40,166
Almost.

932
00:56:41,875 --> 00:56:44,791
We decided I'll stay here
with you for a while.

933
00:56:44,875 --> 00:56:47,083
- Happy?
- Yes.

934
00:56:47,166 --> 00:56:50,750
So I can help you understand
what to do with all this money.

935
00:56:50,833 --> 00:56:54,208
This whole being a millionaire thing
is stressful for Mom.

936
00:56:54,291 --> 00:56:55,250
She needs us.

937
00:56:55,333 --> 00:56:59,916
Support her. It's too much money.
She's so stressed out.

938
00:57:14,750 --> 00:57:18,666
Make sure
you don't trumpet the inheritance thing.

939
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:19,875
Why?

940
00:57:19,958 --> 00:57:23,500
Because when it comes to money,
people become sticky.

941
00:57:23,583 --> 00:57:25,583
Especially relatives.

942
00:57:27,916 --> 00:57:30,583
- Hello. Here we are.
- Hello.

943
00:57:30,666 --> 00:57:31,666
Hello.

944
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:38,000
- You look so pretty.
- No.

945
00:57:43,166 --> 00:57:44,041
Excuse me.

946
00:57:44,625 --> 00:57:45,541
Excuse me.

947
00:57:46,708 --> 00:57:48,125
I'll make a toast.

948
00:57:48,208 --> 00:57:50,875
- What a drag!
- Exactly.

949
00:57:50,958 --> 00:57:53,958
I had prepared a very touching speech.

950
00:57:54,041 --> 00:57:57,041
But given your notorious sentimentalism,

951
00:57:57,125 --> 00:57:59,583
I thought you'd get too emotional.

952
00:57:59,666 --> 00:58:01,041
So I put it aside.

953
00:58:01,125 --> 00:58:02,916
All I'll say is,

954
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,166
Mom, I love you.

955
00:58:05,791 --> 00:58:09,875
- Happy birthday, Giuliana.
- Thank you!

956
00:58:09,958 --> 00:58:13,875
- Thank you, honey.
- Happy birthday.

957
00:58:16,125 --> 00:58:19,375
- Anna?
- Matteo, tell me.

958
00:58:20,416 --> 00:58:23,875
I guess you saved
your touching, heartfelt words

959
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:26,583
for my mother only.

960
00:58:31,083 --> 00:58:33,791
What? We all loved her.

961
00:58:33,875 --> 00:58:34,750
What...?

962
00:58:35,541 --> 00:58:37,375
She only left me peanuts.

963
00:58:38,083 --> 00:58:39,708
You're driving a Ferrari.

964
00:58:40,875 --> 00:58:42,791
Drop it, honey.

965
00:58:42,875 --> 00:58:45,500
Where did she get all that money,
by the way?

966
00:58:45,583 --> 00:58:47,791
At least tell me this, Anna.

967
00:58:47,875 --> 00:58:49,625
It must have been Bisacci.

968
00:58:49,708 --> 00:58:51,875
You were against their relationship.

969
00:58:51,958 --> 00:58:54,791
Nonsense! Mom had no relationship.

970
00:58:56,958 --> 00:58:59,333
You didn't even appear in the will.

971
00:58:59,416 --> 00:59:00,500
How did you do it?

972
00:59:00,583 --> 00:59:01,750
Tell me, how?

973
00:59:01,833 --> 00:59:05,125
Did you make her write
a private agreement on her deathbed?

974
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:06,208
Carlo.

975
00:59:06,291 --> 00:59:07,875
I can't find my napkin.

976
00:59:07,958 --> 00:59:10,625
It's not what you think, Matteo.

977
00:59:10,708 --> 00:59:13,125
It's not? Then what is it?

978
00:59:18,708 --> 00:59:23,708
Anna sent her husband to her.
She put her husband on her.

979
00:59:25,041 --> 00:59:27,041
First, Bisacci.

980
00:59:27,125 --> 00:59:28,500
And then Carlo.

981
00:59:30,166 --> 00:59:32,291
Carlo was fucking her too.

982
00:59:33,375 --> 00:59:37,625
Are you out of your mind?
Bisacci? Who the fuck is Bisacci?

983
00:59:39,458 --> 00:59:41,541
- Where is the money?
- Matteo.

984
00:59:41,625 --> 00:59:42,875
Matteo!

985
00:59:43,458 --> 00:59:45,458
- No!
- Are you the Gestapo?

986
00:59:57,166 --> 00:59:58,333
Slowly.

987
00:59:59,041 --> 01:00:00,583
- Over there, okay?
- Yes.

988
01:00:03,791 --> 01:00:04,666
Okay.

989
01:00:06,833 --> 01:00:07,916
Okay.

990
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,250
- Easy.
- Easy.

991
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,416
If I ever have a family,

992
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:18,416
I doubt I'll be able to do
all you've done for us.

993
01:00:19,625 --> 01:00:22,625
When you become a father,
it will come naturally.

994
01:00:22,708 --> 01:00:23,791
I'm not so sure.

995
01:00:23,875 --> 01:00:27,750
I probably wouldn't have slept
with Aunt Tea for six million.

996
01:00:29,083 --> 01:00:31,708
Don't you start too! Jeez.

997
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:34,000
Honey, how do you feel?

998
01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:38,083
- Like a human wreck.
- Don't play the victim. Come on.

999
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,208
Trimming the tree?

1000
01:00:45,583 --> 01:00:46,708
It's snowing.

1001
01:00:48,583 --> 01:00:51,208
Wow! It hasn't snowed in ages.

1002
01:00:52,708 --> 01:00:55,083
- Snow? Shit, I came by moped.
- Yes.

1003
01:00:55,166 --> 01:00:58,083
So what? You can stay over.

1004
01:00:58,166 --> 01:01:00,000
We'll trim the tree together.

1005
01:01:01,958 --> 01:01:04,916
I'll make hot chocolate.
The one with flour.

1006
01:01:05,791 --> 01:01:06,750
Why not?

1007
01:01:16,250 --> 01:01:18,250
- What?
- I'm happy.

1008
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,708
Look at this.

1009
01:01:33,791 --> 01:01:36,000
She'd look great in this jacket.

1010
01:01:36,583 --> 01:01:37,666
How much is it?

1011
01:01:38,916 --> 01:01:41,208
Please stop talking about money.

1012
01:01:45,291 --> 01:01:46,916
We can't keep this act up.

1013
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,458
We can no longer afford it.

1014
01:01:49,541 --> 01:01:51,958
You know already. It's until Christmas.

1015
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:55,791
At this rate, we'll have to sell
our organs to get to Christmas.

1016
01:01:56,291 --> 01:01:57,958
Stop being a buzzkill.

1017
01:01:58,041 --> 01:02:01,000
I asked until Christmas.
Is it too much? Tell me!

1018
01:02:01,875 --> 01:02:02,958
You scare me.

1019
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:05,583
Look at that.

1020
01:02:07,625 --> 01:02:10,833
Let's give them two IOUs
for a Caribbean trip this summer.

1021
01:02:10,916 --> 01:02:12,500
It's easy to make IOUs.

1022
01:02:13,125 --> 01:02:15,958
It's a Versace. Shall I get this too?

1023
01:02:16,041 --> 01:02:17,666
So she will have two.

1024
01:02:18,625 --> 01:02:20,041
Does Versace take IOUs?

1025
01:02:25,083 --> 01:02:28,166
Take this one.
It's not ironed. Maybe it costs less.

1026
01:02:37,875 --> 01:02:40,916
- What comes after five stars?
- Bankruptcy.

1027
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:41,875
Paradise.

1028
01:02:50,041 --> 01:02:51,500
- Hi.
- How nice.

1029
01:02:59,541 --> 01:03:01,791
- How are you guys? Fine?
- Fine.

1030
01:03:04,416 --> 01:03:05,666
I made up with Rocco.

1031
01:03:06,791 --> 01:03:09,541
- I'm happy for you.
- He's a good guy.

1032
01:03:09,625 --> 01:03:11,500
We're not together, though.

1033
01:03:11,583 --> 01:03:12,791
We just made up.

1034
01:03:13,666 --> 01:03:16,541
Because I realized I want to find my path,

1035
01:03:16,625 --> 01:03:19,333
figure out my dreams and ambitions.

1036
01:03:20,083 --> 01:03:21,000
What ambitions?

1037
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:22,833
Mine.

1038
01:03:23,375 --> 01:03:25,416
Oh, I didn't know...

1039
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:26,958
You think I'm an idiot

1040
01:03:27,041 --> 01:03:29,125
and only Emilio will succeed.

1041
01:03:29,208 --> 01:03:32,458
- Emilio won't succeed either.
- Come on.

1042
01:03:33,166 --> 01:03:34,083
Whatever.

1043
01:03:35,416 --> 01:03:37,041
I want to open a tearoom.

1044
01:03:37,583 --> 01:03:40,500
Tearoom and bookstore. I found a spot.

1045
01:03:41,666 --> 01:03:45,125
- It's great to see you so enthusiastic.
- It is.

1046
01:03:45,208 --> 01:03:47,125
And I'll move out of your house.

1047
01:03:47,208 --> 01:03:50,750
I don't want to risk
resting on my laurels.

1048
01:03:50,833 --> 01:03:53,291
- This I understand.
- But why?

1049
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,375
Where are you going?

1050
01:03:56,083 --> 01:03:58,000
Here. I got a suite.

1051
01:03:59,833 --> 01:04:02,250
The three of us home are so good together.

1052
01:04:02,333 --> 01:04:06,250
I'll stay here for a few days.
I'm already looking for a place.

1053
01:04:06,333 --> 01:04:09,333
That is, of course,
if you guys could help me out.

1054
01:04:15,625 --> 01:04:17,583
Give me the checkbook.

1055
01:04:17,666 --> 01:04:19,875
I may not have it with me.

1056
01:04:19,958 --> 01:04:22,541
- You do. Give it to me.
- Not in this jacket.

1057
01:04:22,625 --> 01:04:23,458
Give it to me.

1058
01:04:28,333 --> 01:04:30,125
- Lucky devil, here it is.
- See?

1059
01:04:31,666 --> 01:04:33,250
I have a pen too.

1060
01:04:33,333 --> 01:04:34,583
How much do you need?

1061
01:04:35,166 --> 01:04:37,916
Well... I have to leave a deposit, so...

1062
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,250
To buy the suite?

1063
01:04:39,833 --> 01:04:41,666
No, for the tearoom.

1064
01:04:43,208 --> 01:04:45,583
I don't know. Ten? Twenty?

1065
01:04:45,666 --> 01:04:48,208
I know you gave Emilio 200,000, so...

1066
01:04:48,291 --> 01:04:51,125
- We just talked about it, but then...
- No.

1067
01:04:53,125 --> 01:04:54,166
What about 40?

1068
01:04:54,250 --> 01:04:57,333
So I won't bother you every month
with bank transfers.

1069
01:04:58,375 --> 01:05:03,041
It's no bother. In fact, if we defer,
we'll see each other more often.

1070
01:05:09,875 --> 01:05:10,750
Forty?

1071
01:05:11,625 --> 01:05:13,125
- Yes. Forty.
- Yes.

1072
01:05:13,208 --> 01:05:14,041
All right.

1073
01:05:18,875 --> 01:05:21,250
- One zero is missing.
- Butt out.

1074
01:05:24,041 --> 01:05:24,958
Done.

1075
01:05:26,375 --> 01:05:27,250
Thanks.

1076
01:05:32,291 --> 01:05:33,666
Careful, it's slippery.

1077
01:05:35,041 --> 01:05:36,375
You're wearing flip-flops.

1078
01:05:39,375 --> 01:05:40,791
What a pleasure!

1079
01:05:40,875 --> 01:05:43,583
I'm so glad you called. How are you?

1080
01:05:43,666 --> 01:05:46,083
- So-so. How are you?
- I'm fine.

1081
01:05:46,166 --> 01:05:49,458
Please follow me.
We'll take a seat in the parlor.

1082
01:05:49,541 --> 01:05:50,666
We'll talk calmly.

1083
01:05:50,750 --> 01:05:51,958
This way, please.

1084
01:05:53,291 --> 01:05:55,125
There's a parlor?

1085
01:05:55,625 --> 01:05:57,916
For special clients. It's a secret.

1086
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,041
- Like the Batcave?
- Exactly.

1087
01:06:00,125 --> 01:06:03,375
And you are like the Bruce Wayne
of Speroncello, right?

1088
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:05,083
Please.

1089
01:06:07,041 --> 01:06:08,958
Hold my calls for half an hour.

1090
01:06:10,291 --> 01:06:12,750
- What parlor? It's just a room.
- All right.

1091
01:06:15,625 --> 01:06:17,583
So what can I do for you?

1092
01:06:17,666 --> 01:06:20,625
We'd like to cash in
our life insurance policy

1093
01:06:20,708 --> 01:06:22,333
and move it to our account.

1094
01:06:22,416 --> 01:06:23,250
Okay.

1095
01:06:23,333 --> 01:06:25,041
And then?

1096
01:06:25,708 --> 01:06:27,708
And that's it.

1097
01:06:28,416 --> 01:06:31,625
Then we need to empty our account.

1098
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,041
Why is that?

1099
01:06:40,416 --> 01:06:41,541
Personal matters.

1100
01:06:45,333 --> 01:06:48,041
I guess
you're switching to a big city bank.

1101
01:06:48,125 --> 01:06:49,250
No.

1102
01:06:49,333 --> 01:06:52,250
Where you feel more comfortable
with your Ferrari.

1103
01:06:52,333 --> 01:06:56,125
They don't know you're small-town people,

1104
01:06:56,208 --> 01:06:59,666
who come from where
the air smells like manure.

1105
01:06:59,750 --> 01:07:02,625
- Isn't that so?
- Are you out of your mind?

1106
01:07:02,708 --> 01:07:06,291
You are spitting on
a ten-year relationship of trust.

1107
01:07:06,375 --> 01:07:07,375
Relationship?

1108
01:07:07,458 --> 01:07:10,250
In Sharm el-Sheikh,
we exceeded our credit ceiling.

1109
01:07:10,333 --> 01:07:12,125
You fucking refused to raise it.

1110
01:07:12,208 --> 01:07:13,083
Relationship?

1111
01:07:13,166 --> 01:07:15,625
No, that is a falsehood!

1112
01:07:15,708 --> 01:07:17,333
I couldn't even buy henna.

1113
01:07:17,416 --> 01:07:19,708
We spent the rest of our vacation

1114
01:07:19,791 --> 01:07:22,125
in our room eating bread and falafel.

1115
01:07:22,208 --> 01:07:24,416
Bread and falafel... yummy.

1116
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:29,083
Ma'am, there are rules,
and the rules must be followed, okay?

1117
01:07:30,291 --> 01:07:35,625
No. You give us our money now
because, as a billionaire,

1118
01:07:35,708 --> 01:07:37,208
I don't want any rules.

1119
01:07:37,291 --> 01:07:41,666
And most of all, now I can tell
you bank people to fuck off.

1120
01:07:44,583 --> 01:07:46,291
Actually, look.

1121
01:07:47,083 --> 01:07:50,666
Take this and go buy yourself some class.

1122
01:07:50,750 --> 01:07:51,708
Boor.

1123
01:07:52,333 --> 01:07:53,666
That's too much.

1124
01:07:54,708 --> 01:07:56,958
Excuse her. She's so dramatic.

1125
01:07:57,750 --> 01:08:00,500
€200. Is she tipping you?

1126
01:08:01,083 --> 01:08:02,875
Take care.

1127
01:08:02,958 --> 01:08:04,791
We made asses of ourselves.

1128
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:11,291
WE LOVE YOU... MOM AND DAD

1129
01:08:11,375 --> 01:08:12,708
Done.

1130
01:08:13,416 --> 01:08:17,166
Now they'll have to forgive us
when we tell them the truth.

1131
01:08:17,250 --> 01:08:19,041
- You think?
- Hell, yes. Jeez.

1132
01:08:19,125 --> 01:08:22,416
If I were given €50,000
every time I was pranked,

1133
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:24,875
I'd gladly be a laughingstock forever.

1134
01:08:26,375 --> 01:08:27,250
They're here.

1135
01:08:30,250 --> 01:08:31,833
I bought the tearoom spot!

1136
01:08:32,458 --> 01:08:35,083
- Huh?
- I bought the tearoom spot.

1137
01:08:35,166 --> 01:08:37,583
I'm going to the notary tomorrow.

1138
01:08:37,666 --> 01:08:38,750
Hi.

1139
01:08:38,833 --> 01:08:42,541
I got a great deal.
200 square meters near the station.

1140
01:08:42,625 --> 01:08:45,708
The guy from the agency
had never seen such a deal.

1141
01:08:45,791 --> 01:08:48,125
- Wow. See?
- €400,000!

1142
01:08:49,041 --> 01:08:49,916
Good.

1143
01:08:51,083 --> 01:08:54,375
I promise this is the last thing
I'll ask of you. I promise.

1144
01:08:54,958 --> 01:08:57,750
You can give
the rest of my share to charity.

1145
01:08:58,375 --> 01:09:00,166
Maybe I'll take it.

1146
01:09:01,583 --> 01:09:02,833
- Dad, look.
- Yes.

1147
01:09:02,916 --> 01:09:04,833
I brought all the papers

1148
01:09:04,916 --> 01:09:07,875
so we can proceed
with signing the financing.

1149
01:09:09,125 --> 01:09:10,750
What great news!

1150
01:09:11,541 --> 01:09:12,375
What's wrong?

1151
01:09:14,791 --> 01:09:15,750
What, Mom?

1152
01:09:19,041 --> 01:09:21,625
Enough. We have to tell you the truth.

1153
01:09:26,166 --> 01:09:29,250
Carlo, we have to tell them.

1154
01:09:29,791 --> 01:09:31,791
- Yes.
- What truth?

1155
01:09:37,208 --> 01:09:39,583
We can't give you that money.

1156
01:09:42,208 --> 01:09:43,125
Right.

1157
01:09:44,208 --> 01:09:45,375
Because...

1158
01:09:47,625 --> 01:09:49,083
your father...

1159
01:09:49,791 --> 01:09:51,250
Me? You too.

1160
01:09:53,416 --> 01:09:54,875
...is very sick.

1161
01:09:56,083 --> 01:10:00,458
- Right.
- He came down with a bad disease. Awful.

1162
01:10:04,250 --> 01:10:05,333
Cancer?

1163
01:10:05,416 --> 01:10:07,250
Even worse.

1164
01:10:07,333 --> 01:10:10,416
- Holy shit.
- It's a rare disease.

1165
01:10:11,375 --> 01:10:14,583
They're working on a cure in America.

1166
01:10:15,458 --> 01:10:17,166
But it's so expensive.

1167
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:18,958
Very expensive.

1168
01:10:19,041 --> 01:10:23,458
So, from now on, we must use our finances...

1169
01:10:24,750 --> 01:10:26,000
to save Dad.

1170
01:10:26,083 --> 01:10:27,250
Save me.

1171
01:10:27,333 --> 01:10:30,541
Hold on. What disease is it?
What is it called?

1172
01:10:31,708 --> 01:10:35,625
It doesn't have a name.
It's just been discovered.

1173
01:10:35,708 --> 01:10:38,125
- Just now.
- How did you find out?

1174
01:10:42,833 --> 01:10:44,000
- I felt...
- Yes.

1175
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:46,291
I was feeling strange.

1176
01:10:46,375 --> 01:10:49,291
- Dizzy.
- Yes, but...

1177
01:10:49,375 --> 01:10:55,708
counterclockwise and hiccuping.
Palpitations.

1178
01:10:55,791 --> 01:10:58,375
Enough. It makes me sick.

1179
01:10:59,291 --> 01:11:03,583
Anyway, apart from the trip to America,

1180
01:11:03,666 --> 01:11:08,041
we also scheduled medical consultations
in Paris and Tokyo.

1181
01:11:08,125 --> 01:11:10,416
Hong Kong too. They're experts.

1182
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:11,416
They are.

1183
01:11:12,208 --> 01:11:15,166
But don't worry.
We'll be back for Christmas.

1184
01:11:15,250 --> 01:11:18,291
Two days in Paris
and we'll be back to celebrate.

1185
01:11:18,375 --> 01:11:20,750
- She'd never miss Christmas.
- Yes.

1186
01:11:21,250 --> 01:11:22,708
Right, so...

1187
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,458
This is all we can do.

1188
01:11:26,208 --> 01:11:27,041
For real?

1189
01:11:29,750 --> 01:11:30,708
Are you kidding?

1190
01:11:33,916 --> 01:11:34,958
We want nothing.

1191
01:11:39,333 --> 01:11:40,791
Thanks.

1192
01:11:41,750 --> 01:11:42,833
Thank you.

1193
01:11:45,291 --> 01:11:46,125
Come here.

1194
01:11:46,208 --> 01:11:49,875
- Let's all pray together for Dad.
- Let's pray.

1195
01:11:50,416 --> 01:11:51,666
Drop dead.

1196
01:12:17,958 --> 01:12:19,833
Now what? What's your plan?

1197
01:12:20,333 --> 01:12:23,333
If you had a better idea,
you could've expressed it.

1198
01:12:23,416 --> 01:12:25,375
Better than pretending I'm dead?

1199
01:12:26,458 --> 01:12:29,083
I didn't know what to do.

1200
01:12:29,166 --> 01:12:31,375
Keep your voice down. They'll hear.

1201
01:12:32,041 --> 01:12:34,125
They'll realize I'm not dying.

1202
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,375
Not necessarily.

1203
01:12:36,958 --> 01:12:39,833
Are you going to kill me
over a damn Christmas dinner?

1204
01:12:39,916 --> 01:12:42,833
Listen, we can tell them you were cured.

1205
01:12:42,916 --> 01:12:45,041
Or the disease remained dormant.

1206
01:12:52,166 --> 01:12:53,000
Who's that?

1207
01:12:56,666 --> 01:12:57,541
Darlings.

1208
01:12:59,416 --> 01:13:00,333
Still awake?

1209
01:13:02,708 --> 01:13:05,208
We want to sleep in bed with you.

1210
01:13:07,458 --> 01:13:09,416
Like we used to on Christmas Eve.

1211
01:13:10,416 --> 01:13:12,875
- Yes, sure. Yes.
- We can't fit.

1212
01:13:16,666 --> 01:13:19,750
Let's try to be happy, okay?

1213
01:13:20,708 --> 01:13:24,500
Even though it may be
the last Christmas we spend together.

1214
01:13:24,583 --> 01:13:26,000
Here we go again!

1215
01:13:26,083 --> 01:13:27,375
Don't say that.

1216
01:13:28,375 --> 01:13:31,250
- Ouch! Don't hit me. I have cancer!
- What?

1217
01:13:31,333 --> 01:13:33,125
- Come on.
- Sorry.

1218
01:13:33,208 --> 01:13:34,708
Good night.

1219
01:13:34,791 --> 01:13:37,708
Son, you need to shower. I'm serious.

1220
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:39,958
- It's really unbearable.
- Okay.

1221
01:13:40,041 --> 01:13:42,041
Don't pull. Wait.

1222
01:13:42,125 --> 01:13:45,375
- Smells like a Calcutta sewer.
- Did you settle?

1223
01:13:45,458 --> 01:13:46,791
- Not my hand.
- All right.

1224
01:13:46,875 --> 01:13:51,083
- I feel oppressed. Don't take my hand.
- Don't fret. It's bad for you.

1225
01:13:51,166 --> 01:13:53,166
I can't sleep like this.

1226
01:13:54,250 --> 01:13:56,250
- Give me your hand.
- Goodness.

1227
01:13:57,375 --> 01:13:59,375
- Unbelievable.
- Come on.

1228
01:14:00,333 --> 01:14:02,333
You're anxious.

1229
01:14:09,250 --> 01:14:12,208
All right. Perfect, thank you.

1230
01:14:12,291 --> 01:14:13,541
- Thanks.
- Hi.

1231
01:14:13,625 --> 01:14:15,000
Hi!

1232
01:14:15,083 --> 01:14:16,541
- How are you?
- Fine.

1233
01:14:16,625 --> 01:14:17,916
How was your day?

1234
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:21,541
- I walked around.
- I see. Okay.

1235
01:14:21,625 --> 01:14:23,125
- The doctor is free.
- Thanks.

1236
01:14:23,208 --> 01:14:24,708
- See you later.
- Bye.

1237
01:14:41,416 --> 01:14:45,291
- Still living with your parents?
- No, I'm living at Mara's now.

1238
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:48,958
I thought it was right
to leave them alone for a while.

1239
01:14:54,708 --> 01:14:55,625
How is Carlo?

1240
01:14:56,750 --> 01:14:59,625
He's fine for now, thank God.

1241
01:15:00,458 --> 01:15:03,791
But I think
he's trying to look strong for us.

1242
01:15:05,250 --> 01:15:07,500
He's in Paris for a consultation now.

1243
01:15:07,583 --> 01:15:09,541
I'd like to see him.

1244
01:15:09,625 --> 01:15:12,375
You know what we can do?
We can video call him.

1245
01:15:12,458 --> 01:15:15,916
- No, let's not disturb him.
- He'd like it.

1246
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,416
Plus, I video call him ten times a day.

1247
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:20,458
You're a good excuse. Come close.

1248
01:15:27,958 --> 01:15:30,291
- Here they are. Hi.
- Hi.

1249
01:15:30,375 --> 01:15:33,458
<i>- Hi.
- How are you, Rocco?</i>

1250
01:15:33,541 --> 01:15:36,541
- Great. Isn't Paris wonderful?
<i>- Yes, a little cold.</i>

1251
01:15:36,625 --> 01:15:38,625
There's no one around?

1252
01:15:38,708 --> 01:15:41,833
<i>Yeah, hardly anyone.
How are you and Emilio?</i>

1253
01:15:44,041 --> 01:15:45,041
You don't know?

1254
01:15:45,833 --> 01:15:48,500
<i>- What?</i>
- He got fired.

1255
01:15:48,583 --> 01:15:49,416
<i>How come?</i>

1256
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:52,750
Maybe he didn't mention it
to not worry you.

1257
01:15:52,833 --> 01:15:55,291
He's already looking for another job.

1258
01:15:55,375 --> 01:15:57,250
He'll stay with me for a while.

1259
01:15:57,333 --> 01:15:59,833
I can't live without a Delle Fave around.

1260
01:15:59,916 --> 01:16:01,333
<i>Let's call him!</i>

1261
01:16:01,416 --> 01:16:04,416
Mom, don't worry. We're fine.

1262
01:16:05,458 --> 01:16:07,458
Enjoy Paris.

1263
01:16:08,541 --> 01:16:11,333
It's so good to see you there so happy.

1264
01:16:11,875 --> 01:16:13,666
<i>Come on, honey. Don't cry.</i>

1265
01:16:13,750 --> 01:16:16,833
<i>Call him, please.
Let's have a family call.</i>

1266
01:16:17,833 --> 01:16:20,625
Okay. I'll add him.

1267
01:16:23,625 --> 01:16:25,291
- Done. Hi.
<i>- Hi.</i>

1268
01:16:26,583 --> 01:16:28,541
<i>- Hi.
- You're all there.</i>

1269
01:16:28,625 --> 01:16:32,041
<i>- How's it going?
- Fine. I was thinking about you.</i>

1270
01:16:32,625 --> 01:16:34,250
<i>Where are you?</i>

1271
01:16:34,333 --> 01:16:36,666
<i>Going home to pick up some shirts.</i>

1272
01:16:37,250 --> 01:16:38,125
Oh...

1273
01:16:38,708 --> 01:16:42,291
Great. Well, listen, we need to go.

1274
01:16:42,375 --> 01:16:43,833
<i>No, Dad, wait.</i>

1275
01:16:43,916 --> 01:16:46,291
<i>- How did it go with Dr. Roland?</i>
- Great!

1276
01:16:46,375 --> 01:16:47,541
<i>He said I'm healthy.</i>

1277
01:16:48,416 --> 01:16:50,125
What do you mean? But...

1278
01:16:51,125 --> 01:16:52,000
<i>Bye.</i>

1279
01:16:53,666 --> 01:16:56,750
Emilio? What are you doing in Paris?

1280
01:17:14,666 --> 01:17:15,916
You had disappeared.

1281
01:17:16,750 --> 01:17:17,958
We never saw you.

1282
01:17:19,250 --> 01:17:20,458
Your mom was desperate.

1283
01:17:21,291 --> 01:17:22,791
You were playing dumb.

1284
01:17:23,666 --> 01:17:25,750
Then you bailed out on Christmas.

1285
01:17:25,833 --> 01:17:28,291
She was destroyed. I mean, you know her.

1286
01:17:28,375 --> 01:17:31,750
- It was his idea, by the way.
- You never objected.

1287
01:17:33,166 --> 01:17:36,208
Anyway, it started out as a game.

1288
01:17:36,833 --> 01:17:38,500
- A game?
- Yes.

1289
01:17:39,375 --> 01:17:42,041
"I bet they'll come around for money."

1290
01:17:42,125 --> 01:17:43,291
Well, you did.

1291
01:17:46,875 --> 01:17:48,958
We'd have told you after Christmas.

1292
01:17:49,708 --> 01:17:51,833
It was so nice having you around.

1293
01:17:51,916 --> 01:17:54,666
Dad being sick was a game too?

1294
01:17:54,750 --> 01:17:56,375
Thank God, yes.

1295
01:17:57,875 --> 01:17:59,708
That was Mom who fucked up.

1296
01:17:59,791 --> 01:18:01,875
I didn't know what else to do.

1297
01:18:01,958 --> 01:18:04,583
But our life was going to shit meanwhile.

1298
01:18:04,666 --> 01:18:06,333
Shame on you both.

1299
01:18:06,416 --> 01:18:08,916
- We just wanted to...
- What?

1300
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Feel you were still there.

1301
01:18:16,958 --> 01:18:18,625
Have a nice Christmas.

1302
01:18:30,750 --> 01:18:34,125
Please don't. They'll come back.
Where else will they go?

1303
01:18:44,291 --> 01:18:47,416
At least you have a Versace bag now.

1304
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:48,333
Yeah.

1305
01:18:52,125 --> 01:18:55,583
I couldn't drive the Ferrari even once.

1306
01:18:56,708 --> 01:18:59,375
Grandma, why didn't you tell us anything?

1307
01:18:59,458 --> 01:19:01,250
God, no!

1308
01:19:01,333 --> 01:19:04,083
Never butt into family matters.

1309
01:19:04,583 --> 01:19:07,041
- You are family.
- All the more reason.

1310
01:19:07,125 --> 01:19:11,583
- I even lost my job.
- You couldn't stand it there anymore.

1311
01:19:11,666 --> 01:19:15,041
In the end, you're all to blame.
But them most of all.

1312
01:19:15,125 --> 01:19:17,833
- Exactly. Thank you.
- What do you mean?

1313
01:19:17,916 --> 01:19:21,125
Meaning I never would've wanted to admit

1314
01:19:21,208 --> 01:19:24,541
that they had to pay
to get your affection.

1315
01:19:26,833 --> 01:19:30,958
They needed you so badly
that they were willing to overlook

1316
01:19:31,041 --> 01:19:33,625
your indifference and your cold shoulders.

1317
01:19:39,166 --> 01:19:40,000
Thanks.

1318
01:19:40,625 --> 01:19:42,291
No, please.

1319
01:19:42,875 --> 01:19:43,708
I'll pay.

1320
01:19:43,791 --> 01:19:46,583
- No, Grandma, let her...
- Let me.

1321
01:19:46,666 --> 01:19:49,250
With all the money Aunt Tea left me,

1322
01:19:49,916 --> 01:19:51,958
I could buy this restaurant.

1323
01:19:55,333 --> 01:19:56,375
Merry Christmas.

1324
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:22,583
Hi.

1325
01:20:23,416 --> 01:20:24,250
Hi.

1326
01:20:25,916 --> 01:20:27,416
Already taking them down?

1327
01:20:28,083 --> 01:20:29,000
Huh?

1328
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:34,625
Yes, because...
since we're no longer millionaires,

1329
01:20:34,708 --> 01:20:36,583
we need to save on electricity.

1330
01:20:37,541 --> 01:20:41,166
Yes, I heard about the prank.

1331
01:20:44,166 --> 01:20:46,666
Not really a prank. It was more...

1332
01:20:47,625 --> 01:20:52,166
a desperate attempt
to get my kids' attention, but...

1333
01:20:55,333 --> 01:20:56,375
I'm sorry.

1334
01:21:02,583 --> 01:21:03,833
How are your kids?

1335
01:21:05,125 --> 01:21:08,750
I came outside to smoke,
but I just wanted some quiet.

1336
01:21:09,666 --> 01:21:11,833
Do you hear how noisy they are?

1337
01:21:13,333 --> 01:21:16,875
And I can't stand my daughter-in-law.
She cooks like shit.

1338
01:21:20,416 --> 01:21:21,750
Merry Christmas, then.

1339
01:21:23,416 --> 01:21:24,375
Merry Christmas.

1340
01:22:04,791 --> 01:22:06,875
Can't you wait until tomorrow?

1341
01:22:06,958 --> 01:22:08,916
Why? What do you care?

1342
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,125
It's Christmas Eve.

1343
01:22:15,083 --> 01:22:18,000
Why don't we go
to the beach for a few days?

1344
01:22:18,083 --> 01:22:20,000
No, it's too damp.

1345
01:22:24,541 --> 01:22:26,000
How about Paris?

1346
01:22:27,833 --> 01:22:31,833
We have that pending consultation
with the oncologist, Dr. Roland.

1347
01:22:31,916 --> 01:22:34,416
- He came down with a bad disease.
- Him too?

1348
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:36,666
- An outbreak.
- You're obsessed?

1349
01:22:36,750 --> 01:22:38,583
What was that?

1350
01:22:38,666 --> 01:22:40,333
What? What's wrong?

1351
01:22:42,166 --> 01:22:45,000
- Must be Santa Claus. Put out the fire.
- Hold on.

1352
01:22:45,625 --> 01:22:48,291
- Do you hear that? Who's there?
- Who's there?

1353
01:22:51,083 --> 01:22:51,958
Who's there?

1354
01:22:54,541 --> 01:22:55,500
There's someone.

1355
01:22:56,625 --> 01:22:59,125
What are you doing? Come here.

1356
01:22:59,208 --> 01:23:00,916
No, don't.

1357
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,958
Come here.

1358
01:23:07,458 --> 01:23:11,208
- Merry...
- Dad, are you nuts? What are you doing?

1359
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:15,208
Honey, he knocked out the same teeth.

1360
01:23:15,291 --> 01:23:17,833
- Jeez.
- A little ice will fix everything.

1361
01:23:19,583 --> 01:23:22,458
First with a golf club,
now with the poker.

1362
01:23:22,541 --> 01:23:24,791
Just shoot me in the face next time.

1363
01:23:24,875 --> 01:23:27,375
You snuck into my house like a thief.

1364
01:23:27,458 --> 01:23:29,875
A thief with Christmas sparklers?

1365
01:23:29,958 --> 01:23:34,333
I don't know. First, I saw a glare,
then a stranger's face

1366
01:23:34,416 --> 01:23:37,583
with a fucking evil sneer, so I struck.

1367
01:23:37,666 --> 01:23:40,083
It's survival instinct.

1368
01:23:40,166 --> 01:23:44,708
Let's say this Christmas
brought out the worst in us.

1369
01:23:45,708 --> 01:23:49,833
But now we're here,
the four of us together.

1370
01:23:50,375 --> 01:23:52,375
Honey, smile.

1371
01:23:53,666 --> 01:23:54,958
Okay, never mind.

1372
01:23:55,625 --> 01:23:58,916
Even though I can't stand you, I love you.

1373
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,750
It's nice to hear that once in a while.

1374
01:24:06,458 --> 01:24:07,416
Remember?

1375
01:24:08,041 --> 01:24:10,750
When you were kids,
I used to put on this song,

1376
01:24:10,833 --> 01:24:15,041
and we'd go around the house
on treasure hunts for Christmas presents.

1377
01:24:15,125 --> 01:24:18,375
We can hunt for my teeth.
I wonder where they ended up.

1378
01:24:18,458 --> 01:24:20,291
Did you lose a molar?

1379
01:24:20,375 --> 01:24:22,125
Fuck if I know!

1380
01:24:22,208 --> 01:24:24,208
No need to curse.

1381
01:24:24,291 --> 01:24:28,083
It's Christmas.

1382
01:24:35,041 --> 01:24:39,250
This rug needs to be cleaned.
How gross! Look at these stains.

1383
01:24:41,041 --> 01:24:43,916
- What do they look like?
- Well, they're teeth.

1384
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,083
Are they white?

1385
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:09,333
- Did you lose a molar?
- Fuck if I know!

1386
01:25:09,416 --> 01:25:11,416
Look for it.

1387
01:25:12,833 --> 01:25:14,583
How did you find out?

1388
01:25:15,833 --> 01:25:18,166
- I felt strange...
- Dizzy.

1389
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,291
He's fucking laughing.

1390
01:25:23,166 --> 01:25:25,750
- My name's Emilio, not Carlo.
- Your name's Carlo.

1391
01:25:25,833 --> 01:25:29,708
Your sister wants to come at... at noon.
I'll do it again.

1392
01:25:29,791 --> 01:25:31,875
- It's been years. Years...
- Us...

1393
01:25:33,708 --> 01:25:35,166
Were you supposed to talk?

1394
01:25:35,250 --> 01:25:37,708
- It's super soft. Touch it.
- Anna.

1395
01:25:37,791 --> 01:25:39,291
- Yeah.
- You look great.

1396
01:25:39,375 --> 01:25:41,208
We haven't said shit yet.

1397
01:25:41,291 --> 01:25:43,416
Oh no. My mistake, sorry.

1398
01:25:46,666 --> 01:25:48,625
I could see that coming.

1399
01:25:52,291 --> 01:25:54,125
Rocco fixed your...

1400
01:25:54,833 --> 01:25:55,958
You didn't finish?

1401
01:26:02,791 --> 01:26:04,541
We're in a cul-de-sac.

1402
01:28:46,750 --> 01:28:51,750
