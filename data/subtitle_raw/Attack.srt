1
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:10,939
Hello Nandu.

2
00:00:10,975 --> 00:00:13,051
Are you standing in front of
the hospital smoking a cigarette?

3
00:00:13,075 --> 00:00:16,008
- My wife is sick, she's inside.
- What happened to her?

4
00:00:16,408 --> 00:00:18,378
You have a gynecological problem.

5
00:00:18,697 --> 00:00:20,077
Gynecological?

6
00:00:20,193 --> 00:00:22,721
- I spend so much money...
- How much does a cigarette cost?

7
00:00:23,285 --> 00:00:25,083
- You're on your way.
- On my way?

8
00:00:25,393 --> 00:00:27,350
- Well, how many do you have in your pocket?
- Ones more.

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,929
Do you buy death but not money
to save your wife from death?

10
00:00:32,255 --> 00:00:33,335
What do you mean?

11
00:00:34,992 --> 00:00:36,988
Look, it says "Death".

12
00:00:37,603 --> 00:00:39,673
And this sanitary towel says "Life".

13
00:00:40,837 --> 00:00:44,727
Don't laugh, for two cigarettes
you can save your wife from an infection.

14
00:00:44,817 --> 00:00:48,860
During menstrual periods the towel
protects her from many germs.

15
00:00:49,172 --> 00:00:52,808
You can also save yourself
from cancer if you stop smoking.

16
00:00:52,898 --> 00:00:55,910
So with the money you spend on death,
you can buy two lives.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,953
Yours and your wife's.

18
00:00:58,043 --> 00:00:59,573
Think and then laugh!

19
00:01:01,003 --> 00:01:03,990
There is nothing good about smoking.

20
00:01:04,037 --> 00:01:06,620
But it takes courage to quit.

21
00:01:36,528 --> 00:01:40,654
SPECIAL THANKS TO NATHAN COPELAND

22
00:02:11,302 --> 00:02:13,302
IN MEMORY OF OUR BELOVED FATHER
1

23
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,560
'We attacked the Indian Army Convoy,
two days ago.'

24
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,120
'It was a small demonstration
of our power.'

25
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,400
'The real war has just begun.'

26
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,840
'I call upon comrades
from all across the world.'

27
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,080
Echo One to Alpha Two.
Echo One to Alpha Two.

28
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,280
Go for Echo One.

29
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,240
We're right on time.
Moving towards LZ.

30
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,360
Copy, Alpha Two.

31
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,440
You're green to go.

32
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,960
India has profaned
our land atrociously.

33
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,200
It's time we sought revenge.

34
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,080
Element of surprise, boys.

35
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,200
Stay sharp.

36
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,520
I'm in position.

37
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,800
Copy.
South-west alley clear.

38
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,320
Watch your six. Over watch is solid.

39
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,400
13 minutes to extraction.

40
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,720
Mark.

41
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,320
Three down.
Ghost Team moving in.

42
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,400
Hostiles in the alley.

43
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,320
Copy that.

44
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,520
Target locked.

45
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,880
Need breathing room.

46
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,920
He's never getting married.

47
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,160
We're under attack!
Take the guns out!

48
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,320
Hurry up!

49
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,400
I've lost visual.

50
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,880
Ghost Team, you're on your own.

51
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,520
Break the door.

52
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,840
Take cover, soldier!

53
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,200
Go check!

54
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,480
Press the trigger!

55
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,000
Cover me!

56
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,040
Sir.

57
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,000
Target is not here. Wrong intel.

58
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,120
We should evacuate now!

59
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,320
No, stay on the objective.

60
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,160
On me, move!

61
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,600
Come on now, move! Move!

62
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,800
Move in.

63
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,480
- Shoot him.
- No. Stand down.

64
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,760
More hostiles incoming.

65
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,960
We've to move, sir.

66
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,360
- Sir, we are..
- No.

67
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,920
Don't be afraid.

68
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,000
I'll release the switch.

69
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,800
- We won't hurt you.
- Don't. I'll release the switch.

70
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,840
Don't worry.
Look at my hand.

71
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,240
There's nothing.

72
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,536
All teams gather up.
We're moving for exfiltration.

73
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,440
Echo One, come in.

74
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,000
- Go for Echo One.
- Leave.

75
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,880
Copy that.
Two minutes to landing zone.

76
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:47,760
Grenade!

77
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,400
Move.. Move..

78
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,960
- Kill them!
- Surround them! Don't let them escape!

79
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,560
Help..Help..

80
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,440
Help..

81
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,656
- Right wing clear, sir.
- Ghost Team, come in.

82
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,440
What's your status?

83
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,960
Echo One, no sign of target.

84
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,640
Mission abort.

85
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,280
Copy that.
Ready for extraction.

86
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,040
Ghost to Delta, we are on the move.

87
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,560
Be advised, road is FUBAR.

88
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,440
Approach from east. Over.

89
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,560
Oh wait, wait, wait!
Oh shit!

90
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,480
Wait, wait, wait.

91
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,240
Call Technical now.
I think we got him.

92
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,400
- Confirm ID of the prisoner.
- Say cheese.

93
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,320
Target confirmed.

94
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,120
Rehman Gul secured. Moving out.

95
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,280
Well Done, boys! Jai hind!

96
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,480
Thank you, sir! Jai Hind!

97
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,120
Jai Hind!

98
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,440
"It's my eyes.."

99
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,440
"It's my eyes.."

100
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,120
Hi!

101
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,800
Hi.

102
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,880
What did you do to your hair?

103
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,600
Put it for a spin
in the washing machine?

104
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,800
Don't ask.

105
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,240
Where's your ID?

106
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,600
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, God.

107
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,240
No, no, no.
Juhi...

108
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,696
- I'll be right back.
- You'll miss the flight, A yes ha.

109
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,720
No chance.

110
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,120
Shit, shit, shit.

111
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,760
I'm... sorry.

112
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,320
- Welcome aboard.
- Hi.

113
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,720
This way, sir.

114
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,240
- Welcome aboard.
- Hello.

115
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,880
This way.

116
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,600
- Hi.
- Shit.

117
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,800
Welcome... aboard.

118
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,560
Ex-boyfriend?

119
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,720
No.

120
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,960
- Welcome aboard.
- Then I call dibs.

121
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,480
Welcome aboard.

122
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,680
A yes ha?

123
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,440
Hmm?

124
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,440
He keeps looking here.

125
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,920
I know.

126
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:41,800
You saw?

127
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,560
Yeah.

128
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,160
I think my Keto diet
is finally working.

129
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,280
- Juhi?
- Hmm?

130
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,920
I'm the one he is looking at.

131
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,720
What makes you think
boys only look at you?

132
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,200
You wanna bet?

133
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,680
- Yes!
- You're on.

134
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,480
Ladies and gentlemen,
the captain has turned off..

135
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,040
...the fasten seat belt sign.
You may now move around the cabin.

136
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,400
It's vacant.

137
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,800
- It's vacant?
- Yeah.

138
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,240
Oh, yeah.

139
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,480
I anyway just wanted
to stretch a bit.

140
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,480
By the way, thank you.

141
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,200
Thank you for not letting me fall.

142
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,320
Oh.

143
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,840
And I'm really sorry
for what came next.

144
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,080
Purely coincidental, unintentional,
but I'm glad I did it.

145
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,680
I mean I'm glad
I didn't let you fall.

146
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,600
So, when does the flight land?

147
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,200
You seem in a hurry?

148
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,360
Important work?

149
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,960
No, I am flying back home.

150
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,720
Got a few days off
after a long time.

151
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,680
Why is that?
What's so important about your work?

152
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,120
I work for the Indian Army.

153
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,520
Lies.

154
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,040
Believe me now?

155
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,080
Nice.

156
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:27,840
Done with the stretching?

157
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,960
No.

158
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,360
You want some juice?

159
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,800
No, thank you.

160
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,040
So, how long have you been
working as a cabin crew?

161
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,080
Three years.

162
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:40,920
You like it?

163
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,160
See, I'm from a conservative
family from Muscat,

164
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,760
with a middle-class background.

165
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,920
This job allows me
to travel for free and

166
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,160
keeps me away from
The conservative thoughts.

167
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,160
And you wanna know the best part?

168
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,800
I get to see something new,
every single time.

169
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,880
New people, new perspectives.

170
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,400
New experiences.

171
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,440
Life will try to hold you down,
but this journey must always go on.

172
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,640
It's beautiful.

173
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,480
Are you okay?

174
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,520
Yeah.

175
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,280
Is everything okay?
Okay.

176
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,800
- Sorry.
- Does this keep happening?

177
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,256
Yes, there's often some
turbulence on this route.

178
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,360
I mean...

179
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,720
does THIS happen often?

180
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,600
Sir, the... seat belt sign is on.

181
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,920
Okay.

182
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,200
Hello.

183
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,720
The seat belt sign is on, sir.

184
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,880
Yes.

185
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,600
Go.

186
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,640
Okay.

187
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,136
There's a restaurant
right outside the airport.

188
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,040
Have a coffee with me.

189
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,520
Are you crazy?
Go back to your seat.

190
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,960
I don't even know your name.

191
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,520
Arjun Shergill.
And yours?

192
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,080
A yes ha.

193
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,600
A yes ha. Full name?

194
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,000
Just A yes ha.

195
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,120
Like Madonna.

196
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,640
Oh, pleasure to meet you.

197
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,120
And you too, Beyonc*.

198
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,160
Coffee?

199
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,240
No!

200
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,896
Please go back to your seat.
We're flying into turbulence.

201
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,640
What about the
turbulence in my heart?

202
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,520
Oh...

203
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,480
- so cheesy!
- I'll wait for you.

204
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,520
Just go back to your seat, soldier.

205
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,760
I'll be waiting, you tell her.

206
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,080
Hi.

207
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,200
Hi.

208
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,920
You have no idea how many
rules I'm breaking to meet you.

209
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,800
You won't regret it.
I promise.

210
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,760
Shall we?

211
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,240
Sure.

212
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,400
"I can't survive without you."

213
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,920
"I feel at peace
when I am with you."

214
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:04,120
"I feel at peace
when I am with you."

215
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:09,400
"I don't care about
what the world says."

216
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:14,120
"I feel at peace
when I talk to you."

217
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:18,120
"I feel at peace
when I talk to you."

218
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,800
"Only when I talk to you."

219
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,160
"I am yours."

220
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,680
"Just yours."

221
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,640
"I am not my own anymore."

222
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,240
"I am yours."

223
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,720
"Just yours."

224
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:39,280
"I am not my own anymore."

225
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:44,440
"You dwell in me."

226
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:50,360
"I am not my own anymore."

227
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:03,960
"I can't survive without you."

228
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:09,040
"I feel at peace
when I am with you."

229
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:14,480
"I don't care about
what the world says."

230
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,920
"I feel at peace
when I talk to you."

231
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,320
"I feel at peace
when I talk to you."

232
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,200
"Only when I talk to you."

233
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,560
"I know you inside out."

234
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,040
"I know your soul."

235
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,560
"I know you inside out."

236
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,920
"Even you don't know
you as well as I do."

237
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,360
"I know you inside out."

238
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,720
"I know your soul."

239
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,280
"I know you inside out."

240
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,680
"Even you don't know
you as well as I do."

241
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:49,440
"It's you and just you."

242
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:54,320
"It's you and just you."

243
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,400
"I am yours."

244
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,920
"Just yours."

245
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:03,480
"I am not my own anymore."

246
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:08,320
"You dwell in me."

247
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,640
"I am not..."

248
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,240
"I am yours."

249
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,800
"Just yours."

250
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:25,960
"I am not my own anymore."

251
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,640
Oh, my God.

252
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,120
Move!
Move!

253
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,320
Arjun!

254
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,400
Arjun!

255
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,200
Arjun!

256
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,480
A yes ha...

257
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,880
Quickly get inside!

258
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,680
Arjun?

259
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,480
Arjun...

260
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,080
A yes ha!

261
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,280
Arjun...

262
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,600
Arjun!

263
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,720
Oh...

264
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:14,600
Mom?

265
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,320
Oh, Arjun... you woke up.

266
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,000
Oh, Arjun... my baby.

267
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,960
My baby...

268
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,360
Thank God.

269
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,920
Arjun?

270
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,560
- Where's A yes ha?
- Huh?

271
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,840
- What?
- Where's A yes ha?

272
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,680
Who?

273
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,400
A yes ha.

274
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,800
I'll go get the doctor.

275
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:55,320
We extracted the bullet,
but the fall has injured your spin.

276
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,520
Vertebrae C1 and C2 have broken.

277
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,760
That's why you're paralyzed
from the neck down.

278
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,760
...and as a result you only have
slight movement in your right hand.

279
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,920
How long will it
take for me to recover?

280
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,280
Like I said,
C1 and C2 Vertebrae are damaged-

281
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,920
I heard you, Doctor.

282
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,080
When will I be back on my feet?

283
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,040
Arjun.

284
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,720
Let him finish.

285
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,120
Arjun, this...

286
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,120
paralysis is permanent.

287
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,240
Permanent?

288
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,040
How can it be permanent?

289
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,080
Mom?

290
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:53,160
"I want you to be upset once again."

291
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:58,800
"I want to cajole you once again."

292
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,040
"I want you to go away once again."

293
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:09,280
"I want to call
you back once again."

294
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:14,840
"What do I make of
this silence in my life?"

295
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:19,800
"Let's get together
and talk this out."

296
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:24,680
"Tell me what's in your heart."

297
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:30,120
"This silence is killing me,
please speak up."

298
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:35,800
"Tell me what's in your heart."

299
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:41,240
"This silence is killing me,
please speak up."

300
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:14,800
"I feel like a wounded
bird's struggling inside."

301
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:20,000
"Fighting to survive,
while I feel dead outside."

302
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:25,040
"I feel like a twig
braving a storm."

303
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:29,640
"What do I make of
this silence in my life?"

304
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,680
"Tell me what's in your heart."

305
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:40,280
"This silence is killing me,
please speak up."

306
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,640
Breaking News!

307
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:50,720
We now know the terror group responsible
for last year's DG Airport Terror Attack.

308
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,440
More than 300 people
had died in this attack.

309
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,320
According to our sources,
SeT is behind this attack.

310
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:00,400
It was masterminded by Hamid Gul.

311
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,520
He is intrepidly running
terror camps in PoK.

312
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,640
Mr. Sachin. Mr. Devanshu.

313
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,920
We should keep politics out of this.

314
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,240
But the government
is doing politics over it.

315
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,360
'Don't.'

316
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,520
'Leave.'

317
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,760
The question of the hour:

318
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,880
What is our government
doing to protect our country?

319
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,496
Don't you think we
should ask this question?

320
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,520
I think the government
is answerable to the people.

321
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,880
I think the government needs to

322
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,800
answer all questions related to the
security of our country right away.

323
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,960
Everyone's here?
Let's start the meeting.

324
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,200
Sit, sit.
Please sit down.

325
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,240
What intelligence do we have on SeT?

326
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,200
Sir, we're in the dark about three
people in the SeT inner circle,

327
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,520
but what we do know is Hamid Gul has
taken over the leadership of Lashkar.

328
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,960
This is the only existing
photograph we have of Hamid.

329
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,680
We had arrested his father
Rehman Gul a couple of years back.

330
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,440
An Oxford-educated
computer engineer.

331
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,840
A modern-day terrorist.

332
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,960
His followers treat
him like a messiah, sir.

333
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,280
They are brainwashed and
trained like elite soldiers.

334
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,840
They have it engraved in their mind

335
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,880
that there will be no peace in
their land as long as India exists.

336
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,880
How do we tackle him?

337
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,560
Sir, I recommend
a full-blown operation.

338
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,960
That would mean war.

339
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,240
This isn't the right option.

340
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,160
I agree.

341
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:15,440
Terrorists have wised
up after our last operation.

342
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,496
Now they run their terror
camps in civilian areas.

343
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,040
We have another option, sir.

344
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,680
Super Soldier program.

345
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,800
Come on, Mr. Subramanium,

346
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,296
why do you keep insisting
on discussing the same old thing?

347
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,520
Because it's important and I
continue to believe it is going to work.

348
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,520
When peace talks fail
and war isn't an option,

349
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,640
science always comes to the rescue.

350
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,440
What exactly do you have in mind?

351
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,000
Artificial Intelligence.

352
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,800
An artificially intelligent
super soldier...

353
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,880
can destroy such terrorist
camps singlehandedly,

354
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,840
that too without
any collateral damage.

355
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,280
Looks like you watch
too many Hollywood films.

356
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,920
Yes, I love Hollywood films.

357
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:52,240
Do you know where the first
armed military drone was used?

358
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,920
October 7, 2001, Kandahar.
It was a US military drone-

359
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,120
Wrong.

360
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:01,360
1980, the movie 'Star Wars'
featured the world's first drone.

361
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,720
Today's fiction
is tomorrow's reality.

362
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:09,360
Not just us, but every
advanced nation in the world -

363
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,320
America, China, Israel,

364
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,520
are all working on such
intelligent soldier programs.

365
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,360
You will look at them and go:

366
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,440
"How wonderful!"

367
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,160
"Superb!"

368
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,280
"So cool!"

369
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,880
But you find it hard to believe
when Indian scientists work on it.

370
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:29,640
Because of our inferiority complex,
we Feel that they're better than us.

371
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,800
But I have news for you.
They are not.

372
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,840
We come second to none.

373
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,640
We have young and dynamic
scientists who know this.

374
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,960
They are confident,
bold, and daring.

375
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,560
Our super-soldier program head,
Sabah Qureshi.

376
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,880
She has been working with
RDO for the last seven years.

377
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,480
And they are on a verge
of a major breakthrough.

378
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,760
There's no doubt in my mind,
that future wars will be..

379
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,520
Won using artificial intelligence
and not arms and artillery.

380
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,800
And India has to be there first.

381
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,440
It's time to revolutionize
the Indian Army.

382
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,400
Sir, we are ready for human trials.

383
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,696
- We just need a go-ahead from you...
- By 'humans' you mean our soldiers?

384
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,240
One soldier.

385
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:11,280
Mr. Subramanium, are you suggesting
we run experiments on our soldiers?

386
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,120
Use them as lab rats?

387
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,096
Sir, we are not going to take any
steps without the soldier's permission.

388
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,600
And me and you very clearly know

389
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,360
peace talks, border skirmishes,

390
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,080
surgical strikes haven't
changed anything.

391
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,920
What I am suggesting

392
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:27,760
will put an end to the entire terrorist
community and not just Hamid Gul.

393
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,000
For how long will we
resort to counteracting?

394
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,040
It's time we ATTACK!

395
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,720
It's time for one final ATTACK!

396
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,960
You get on with it. I'll handle him.

397
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,360
Let go.

398
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,800
Push him off the chair.

399
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,000
How dare you bite me!
How dare you!

400
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,680
Let him go.

401
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,840
Let go.

402
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,480
My son's...

403
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,720
Let me go.

404
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,520
Help! Help!

405
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,960
Shut up!

406
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,400
Zip it.

407
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,200
I'll kill you.

408
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,720
Shut up!

409
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,680
- I'll kill her.
- No, no.

410
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,840
- Let's go, bro.
- Get the things.

411
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,280
Stay quiet! Shut up!

412
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,480
- Take whatever you want.
- I'm done. Let's go.

413
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,920
- Give me your ring.
- No!

414
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,080
Or I'll chop off your finger.

415
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,800
Should I chop off
your finger and take it?

416
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,920
Let's go, bro. I'm done. Let's go.

417
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,520
Oh, my God.

418
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,520
Arjun?

419
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,800
You okay?

420
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,320
Are you okay?

421
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,040
Are you okay, Mom?

422
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,360
Yes, I am fine.

423
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,120
I am okay.

424
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,360
You are okay?

425
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,480
Yeah?

426
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,360
Come on...

427
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,880
Get up.

428
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,080
Get up.

429
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,680
Mom...

430
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,600
I am sorry, Mom.

431
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:17,560
They are physically
fit soldiers, sir.

432
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,800
Sabah, you are aware
of the terror around.

433
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,120
Situation has changed.

434
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,640
Sir, with all due respect,

435
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,680
I didn't develop this
technology for warfare.

436
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,800
It is meant to give new
life to paralyzed people.

437
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:33,640
If we implant this
into a healthy person,

438
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,296
he can get paralyzed
for life and it's...

439
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,280
Sabah, Prime Minister
has approved it.

440
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,760
I get it.
I know this is very important.

441
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,400
And the RDO is backing,
I am very grateful for that,

442
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,720
but this is not what we spoke about.

443
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,000
I cannot forget my morals.

444
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,080
I am sorry, I can't do this.

445
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,920
Sabah, will you give us a minute?

446
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,080
Sure.

447
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,000
What's the problem?

448
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,640
Just kick her out of the project.

449
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,320
She is the project, sir.

450
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,160
We can't move without her.

451
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,880
Then just find a paralyzed soldier,
there has to be one somewhere.

452
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,200
Arjun, you have a guest.

453
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,400
Shergill.

454
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,560
How are you doing?

455
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,960
I'm very busy, sir.

456
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,480
- Very hectic.
- Hmm.

457
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,880
Would you like some tea?

458
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,440
- Mom?
- Uh-huh?

459
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,520
He takes it with sugar,
one teaspoon.

460
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,040
Thanks, Mom.

461
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,960
Someone's chewing
gum instead of smoking.

462
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
I quit.

463
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,640
Very impressed.

464
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,880
What brings you here?

465
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,400
The last you checked
on me was a year back.

466
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,880
Hamid Gul.

467
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,640
We need to get him.

468
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,840
Believe me, sir,

469
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:56,720
Hamid would be dead by
now if I wasn't in a wheelchair.

470
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,760
But all I can say is good luck.

471
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,320
I'm not here for your best wishes.

472
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,400
I need you back.

473
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,400
Back in what?

474
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,160
Army.

475
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,096
With all due respect sir,
this isn't funny anymore.

476
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,680
And I am damn serious.

477
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,600
You know, we...

478
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,560
Thank you.

479
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,760
We have developed a computer chip.

480
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,680
And it's revolutionary.

481
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,800
It can change your life.

482
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,600
We'll implant this computer
chip into your body

483
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,496
and you'll be back
on your feet again.

484
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,600
Impossible.

485
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,760
Doctors said that the
damage is irreversible.

486
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,640
I won't be able to walk again.

487
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,360
Should I believe in
Medical science or your 'SIM Card'?

488
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,440
This 'SIM Card' will
not only help you walk again

489
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,520
it will also give you
the ability to run, to fight.

490
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:46,400
It will give you the strength
you have never experienced before.

491
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:49,320
You will be the world's
first Super Soldier.

492
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,600
- But sir...
- You'll get all the answers,

493
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,040
But, I need mine first.

494
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,440
Why me, sir?

495
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,920
We need a soldier
who has nothing to lose.

496
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,360
It's an invasive surgery.

497
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,040
Survival chances are slim

498
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,720
50-50?

499
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,080
20-80.

500
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,800
Not bad.

501
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,696
Details of the procedure
are in this file.

502
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,720
Read it.

503
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,600
I'll wait for your call.

504
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,080
This guy will never change.

505
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,880
He used to drop in unannounced
to meet your father as well.

506
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,960
What was he here for?

507
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,160
Didn't you say that
everything will be fine?

508
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,680
Looks like God has finally
answered your prayers.

509
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:41,120
There are around 65 million
people in a wheelchair in the world.

510
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:44,440
Our dream was to help
them get back on their feet

511
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,040
with the help of a
brain-machine interface.

512
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:51,960
Innovators like Elon Musk have been
experimenting on this for a couple of years.

513
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,160
Now what you see here
is real-life footage

514
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,280
of an American patient from 2016

515
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,800
who underwent a similar procedure.

516
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,640
So ours is a three-part process.

517
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:04,280
Part One: A robotic precision arm will
implant bionic chips into your brain.

518
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,840
The neural threads of these
chips will read your brain signals.

519
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:14,400
Part Two: A microcomputer will be placed
in your neck to decode these signals.

520
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,440
And third: Nano wireless electrodes.

521
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,720
They will be injected
into your limb muscles,

522
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,040
thereby completing
the brain-machine interface

523
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,360
by-passing your injured spinal cord.

524
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,920
So, for example,
if you want to move your hand.

525
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,840
The chip will read
your brain signal,

526
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:34,560
the computer will decode it and pass
the information to the electrodes.

527
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,200
Resulting in, hopefully,
the movement of your hand.

528
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,920
You already know the risks.

529
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,000
But I still have to ask,
are you ready for this?

530
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:50,240
You know what you need
to do if I don't survive this?

531
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,680
We'll ensure that your
mother is taken care of.

532
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,480
I'm ready.

533
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,200
Ma'am, his body
temperature is rising.

534
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,920
There's internal bleeding, ma'am.
He's at 102.

535
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,320
I need more time.

536
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,120
You don't have time.

537
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,640
Just a little more time.

538
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,520
He's at 105!

539
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,440
What's wrong?

540
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,080
His body temperature is rising.

541
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,016
We'll have to stop the
procedure or else he'll die.

542
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,216
Okay, pulling out the robotic arm...

543
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,920
No. The procedure continues.

544
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
He knows the risks.

545
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,160
Continue.
Continue.

546
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,360
CONTINUE.

547
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,280
He's stabilizing.

548
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,640
Arjun?

549
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,800
My head's hurting.

550
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,840
That's absolutely normal.

551
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,720
Your nervous system is
trying to connect with the chip.

552
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,280
It'll subside after some time.

553
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,360
It's... it's unbearable.

554
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,520
- I think we should sedate him.
- No, no, no.

555
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,160
The chip and the brain
need to establish a connection.

556
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,760
Arjun, you have to bear this pain.

557
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,320
Try to divert your attention.

558
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,680
How?

559
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,560
Try moving your hand?

560
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,080
- Come on.
- Arjun...

561
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,480
focus harder.

562
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,960
I'm focusing.

563
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,360
I can't move it.

564
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,680
- The pain's unbearable.
- It's okay.

565
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,400
It's... it's okay.

566
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,400
Take some rest.

567
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,920
We can try again after some time.

568
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,400
My head's killing me.

569
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,920
Unbelievable.

570
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,080
Sit up.

571
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,720
What's this voice that I hear?

572
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,040
I.R.A.

573
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,120
I.R.A.?

574
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,920
Intelligent Robot Assistant.

575
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,360
The 'Chip' inside you.

576
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,560
She is your personal assistant
who'll only follow your commands.

577
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,920
Just like Siri,
Alexa, and Google Home.

578
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,320
Hello.

579
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,320
I'm I.R.A..

580
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,280
First-generation
neural AI version 1.1.

581
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:15,360
Deep learning at 51
Tera Operations Per Seconds.

582
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,200
At your service.

583
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,840
Would you like to stand up?

584
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:21,960
Great.

585
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,840
System error,
neural bonding in progress.

586
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,400
His muscles are still weak.

587
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,320
It will take him some time to adapt.

588
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,000
Recalibrating.

589
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:23,280
"Not just the ground,
I want to rule the sky."

590
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:27,960
"I will break everyone around,
but I won't break."

591
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,840
"Not just the ground,
I want to rule the sky."

592
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:37,320
"I will break everyone around,
but I won't break."

593
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:42,480
"God has gifted
me with a new spirit."

594
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:45,880
"I want to spread my wings and..."

595
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,200
Arjun!

596
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,400
Are you okay?

597
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,600
- Yeah.
- Are you okay?

598
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:52,680
Yeah.

599
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:53,800
Yeah.

600
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:55,960
Again.

601
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,200
"I won't break today."

602
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,360
"I just won't."

603
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,320
"I will break all boundaries today."

604
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,960
"I won't break today."

605
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,080
"I just won't."

606
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,720
"I will do the impossible today."

607
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:11,120
"I won't break, my friend."

608
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,520
"I won't break, my friend."

609
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,760
"I will do the impossible today."

610
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,840
Bad shot. You missed
the target by six inches.

611
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:19,800
Did I ask for your opinion?

612
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:20,960
No.

613
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,920
Still bad, we need to sync 100%.

614
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:34,800
"I'll kill you or die trying."

615
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:39,400
"I'll kill you or die trying."

616
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:44,000
"I'll crush you."

617
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:46,400
"I'll kill you or die trying today."

618
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:49,040
"Nothing can stop me today."

619
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,880
Don't over think, Arjun.

620
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,120
What do you mean?

621
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,240
Trust your reflexes and I.R.A.
will handle the rest.

622
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,760
"I won't break today."

623
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,920
"I just won't."

624
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,160
Sir, this is solid intel.

625
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:08,320
Hamid is procuring chemical
weapons in Eastern Europe.

626
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:14,600
"I won't break, my friend."

627
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:17,040
"I won't break, my friend."

628
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,160
"I will do the impossible today."

629
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,440
"Attack!"

630
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:35,960
He's a fighter.

631
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,720
Connect him to the system.

632
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:42,080
No sir,
I don't think he's ready yet.

633
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,200
He needs more time.

634
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,280
We don't have time.

635
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,640
- Just connect him.
- Sir...

636
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,760
This is the government mainframe.

637
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,240
Restoring the body movement
was the first step.

638
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,080
Now comes the exciting stuff.

639
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,480
What exactly are we doing?

640
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,480
We're making you the Big Boss.

641
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:04,160
Connect him.

642
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:13,760
I.R.A. will always stay connected to this
government mainframe via satellite link.

643
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,400
Through which you'll have access to
government data, criminal records,

644
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:22,560
Interpol files,
intelligence, tactical skills.

645
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:26,320
It's like you have a
FASTag for tolls?

646
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,040
Oh, this is amazing, but...

647
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,360
But?

648
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,320
Why is it pink?

649
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:34,800
I like pink.

650
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,280
But I can change
the color if you want.

651
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
How's this?

652
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,480
Much better.

653
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:44,160
Boys will be boys.

654
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,000
Stop, stop, stop.

655
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,040
What did you see?

656
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,280
Toggle back.

657
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:49,480
Stop.

658
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,000
It's nothing.

659
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,120
I know what you're thinking.

660
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,960
Good, but stop reading my mind.

661
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:10,640
I command you.

662
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,040
Invalid command.

663
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,480
It is my job to read your mind.

664
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:15,640
Really?

665
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:17,600
Then take a good
look at this picture.

666
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,760
I need his address.

667
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:23,000
235, Nehru Place.

668
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:24,080
Why do you need it?

669
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,640
I'm taking you for a test drive.

670
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,200
How exciting!

671
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:28,320
Yeah?

672
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,200
Now play some music.

673
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:41,960
Target identified.

674
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:53,840
Yo, dude.

675
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,080
What do you want?

676
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:57,840
The ring.

677
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,080
Weren't you in a wheelchair?

678
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,080
You've packed some muscles, dude.

679
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,640
It's sick!

680
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,480
Searching "Boht Hard!"

681
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:09,760
Slang for very impressive.

682
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:11,080
I want the ring back.

683
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:12,360
Wait.

684
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,600
Bring me his mother's ring.

685
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:18,440
Here.

686
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,216
It comes with a
price tag of 100,000,

687
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:23,200
but I'll give it
to you for just 60,000.

688
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:31,800
Here.

689
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,800
Let's close the deal at 600.

690
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:40,640
That's it? Your mother's
ring is worth so little?

691
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:44,320
No, this is what you'll
need for the hospital visit later.

692
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,280
- Get up, bro.
- Hey!

693
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:50,800
Wait right here.

694
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:53,000
You're a dead man walking,
you bastard.

695
00:47:58,720 --> 00:47:59,920
You're emotional.

696
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:01,960
Do you like jewellery?

697
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:05,280
Stop. Stop.

698
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:15,080
Hedonistic psychological
patterns observed.

699
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:17,800
Threat level high.

700
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,000
We should leave.

701
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:20,240
Shh, I.R.A..

702
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:22,120
I don't need you right now.

703
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:25,200
- You scoundrel.
- Don't talk, just watch.

704
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:26,680
Fine, have it your way.

705
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:32,560
I.R.A., why is my arm locked?

706
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:35,000
It was your command.
You said you didn't need me.

707
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,800
"Don't talk, just watch."

708
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,920
I.R.A., learn to distinguish between
instructions and expressions.

709
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:41,616
Sometimes an expression
can have two different meanings.

710
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:42,400
Is he mental?

711
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:43,720
Humans are so confusing.

712
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:44,680
We need to talk more.

713
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,000
Yes, we will,
but let's deal with them first.

714
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,200
Sure.

715
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,200
Activating Combat Mode.

716
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,560
50 stitches required.

717
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:02,720
Whoa!

718
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,040
How did you do that?

719
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:05,960
Simple.
I downloaded it from the internet.

720
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:06,760
Downloaded it?

721
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,680
Yes, Super Soldier can download any

722
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,760
fighting skill in the
world from the mainframe.

723
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:11,920
Really?

724
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,160
What else can we do?

725
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:16,040
Shh! "Don't talk, just watch."

726
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:17,520
Hey!

727
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,840
Uh-oh, he shouldn't have done that.

728
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:16,160
Leveling up.

729
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:19,760
Activating Super Combat Combo Two.

730
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:23,680
In three, two, one.

731
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,800
And that's a knockout.

732
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:51,720
Switching back to
civilian safety mode.

733
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,560
Calculating damage.

734
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:56,200
12 injured, no fatalities.

735
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,720
Checking vitals.

736
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:58,960
All normal.

737
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,520
Neural bonding intact.

738
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:01,720
Congratulations.

739
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:04,080
I guess our first
test drive was a success.

740
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:08,600
Or maybe not.

741
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:10,960
I.R.A., we have
to escape at any cost.

742
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:11,880
I can't get caught.

743
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,560
- You got it?
- Copy that.

744
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,080
- Turn left.
- Left. Okay.

745
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:17,600
Then?

746
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:19,800
Jump!

747
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:21,640
No, no, no!

748
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,280
Are you serious?

749
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:24,400
Affirmative.

750
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,080
It's my job to stay serious.

751
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:28,680
Police.

752
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:29,800
- What?
- 20 meters away.

753
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:31,040
Huh?

754
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:33,336
Don't we have any other option?

755
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:35,320
Negative.
This is the best option.

756
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:36,840
See that garbage truck?

757
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:38,680
Soft and safe landing.

758
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,560
Great. Garbage truck.

759
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,600
Remember, we do this together.

760
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,200
No hesitations.

761
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:45,880
Total sync is needed.

762
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:49,000
Okay.
Okay.

763
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:50,400
Initiating jump.

764
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:53,680
I.R.A.?

765
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:57,000
Overriding.
"We need to escape at any cost."

766
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:59,880
I.R.A., no!!!

767
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:05,640
Happy birthday to you!

768
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,080
- Happy birthday to me!
- Happy birthday to you!

769
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,280
- Happy birthday to you!
- Happy birthday to me!

770
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:13,360
...and many-many-many
more birthdays to come.

771
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:14,800
- Thank you.
- All with me

772
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:16,040
and not on duty.

773
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:17,160
Of course.

774
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,160
Such a liar.

775
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,360
Wake him up.
Wake him up.

776
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,440
You said this was a minor glitch.

777
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:29,600
Then why is it taking so long?

778
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:31,920
- I.R.A. is not the problem.
- Then what is the problem?

779
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:33,680
I told you he's not ready.

780
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:38,320
I.R.A. will be restricted until
he moves on from his past trauma.

781
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,760
You know, the two most important
days of our life...

782
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,040
...are the day we are born...

783
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:51,440
...and the day we find out why?

784
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,240
Do you know what
were you born to do?

785
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:55,520
No.

786
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:56,600
Do you?

787
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:57,920
Since a long time.

788
00:52:58,840 --> 00:52:59,840
And what is that?

789
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:01,440
For you.

790
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:28,920
What just happened?

791
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,040
Nothing.

792
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,600
The chip malfunctioned
because of the head injury.

793
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:37,080
Your brain powers I.R.A..

794
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:40,400
I.R.A. shuts down once
you become unconscious.

795
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:44,400
I've been stimulating your brain with
artificial neuron signals for four hours.

796
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:46,880
Thankfully I.R.A. booted
up and came online.

797
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:50,720
What if this happens
again and you are not around?

798
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,360
Then you'll have
to wake up on your own.

799
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,240
But that dream looked quite real.

800
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:57,280
I thought I was awake.

801
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:03,760
You see,
you are our first human subject.

802
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:06,576
We too are witnessing these
patterns for the first time.

803
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:09,680
On Standby Mode, I.R.A.
acts like a desktop screen saver.

804
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,280
She will show you visuals
from your past memories.

805
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:15,200
But, to come out of it, you'll
have to be the one to press 'Enter'

806
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:17,600
Am I making sense?

807
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:24,520
And what if I cannot distinguish
between the dream and the reality?

808
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:26,920
Then...

809
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:28,680
deep coma.

810
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,800
You might never come out of it.

811
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:36,280
But relax, all will be well.

812
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:39,200
Alert! All is not well.

813
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:44,240
Noted.

814
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:45,400
Sir.

815
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:47,720
Just give me ten minutes.

816
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:51,080
What was the emergency
that made you break the protocol?

817
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,640
Please enlighten me.

818
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:56,160
I'm sorry sir, I got excited
and things got out of control-

819
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:58,160
Then learn to control yourself!

820
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:03,240
If you can't do this, we can give this
chip to another responsible soldier.

821
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:05,520
- No. I like you, Arjun.
- Shut up.

822
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:07,400
What?

823
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:08,880
I mean it won't happen again, sir.

824
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:10,480
- Can I trust you, soldier?
- Yes, sir.

825
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:11,520
I didn't hear you.

826
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:12,960
- Is he deaf?
- Shut...

827
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:14,160
I mean, yes sir.

828
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:16,016
Tomorrow, Sabah and I'll
be going to the parliament

829
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:18,200
to submit your progress
report to the Defense Minister.

830
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:23,600
But I think you are
still not ready for Hamid.

831
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:25,840
It's Hamid who isn't
ready for me, sir.

832
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,840
So dramatic.

833
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:34,760
No more. Stop.

834
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:36,840
Okay.

835
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:56,680
Hey, are you done?

836
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:57,960
Almost done, sir.

837
00:55:58,080 --> 00:55:59,560
How much time do we have?

838
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:02,280
Sir, real RAF trucks
will reach here in 15 minutes.

839
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,600
We need to reach there before that.

840
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:07,360
Shit, they have a double
verification system.

841
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:08,816
Sir, we'll have to hack
into the parliament's server.

842
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:10,320
Please inform Wakas.

843
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:11,760
Wakas, come in.

844
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,400
- Yes, Brother?
- Deploy it, Wakas.

845
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:15,520
Over.

846
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,440
- Good morning, ma'am.
- Good morning.

847
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:34,760
Photo ID, please.

848
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:39,400
Check it.

849
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:51,240
- You may proceed, ma'am.
- Thank you.

850
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,800
Visitor's parking
is on the left side.

851
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:19,760
Let me go!
Let go of me!

852
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:26,240
If you want to see them alive, then it's
better if my men stay out of your house.

853
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:36,840
Drive fast, Raju.

854
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,680
Meeting's scheduled for today,
not tomorrow.

855
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:40,280
- Hello?
- Sabah?

856
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:41,400
I'm getting a bit late.

857
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:42,760
- Just wait for me.
- Yeah, sir.

858
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:44,960
Hurry up.

859
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:46,480
We have orders.

860
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:47,720
Check it.

861
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:04,440
Clear, sir.

862
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:06,360
Control Room?

863
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:08,840
Officer Mehta,
I need confirmation for RAF

864
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:10,400
to be allowed inside the Parliament.

865
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:11,320
This is confirmation.

866
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:12,560
Delhi is on high alert.

867
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:14,560
So RAF has been approved
for the Parliament.

868
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:15,680
Over.

869
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:25,960
Hello?

870
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:30,560
Is the jammer on?

871
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:32,000
Yes, sir.

872
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:58,760
Does RAF have permission
to come inside?

873
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,280
- No.
- Check it.

874
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:04,520
Greetings, Brother.

875
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:05,640
Greetings.
How are you?

876
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:06,720
Good.

877
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:10,880
Careful with that.

878
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:25,440
What are you guys doing here?

879
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:33,240
We are ready.

880
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:34,200
We are ready as well.

881
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:36,840
Nobody moves until PM arrives.

882
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:38,416
We don't have that kind of time,
Brother.

883
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:40,080
Real RAF trucks are already there.

884
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:41,200
Wait.

885
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:46,560
Who's A yes ha?

886
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:48,960
Awaiting reply.

887
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:50,480
I ask the questions.

888
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:52,360
I am the boss here.

889
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:53,680
Of course, boss.

890
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:56,320
But A yes ha is occupying
too much space in your mind.

891
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,000
It is hindering with our connection.

892
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:00,440
So, what should I do?

893
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:02,880
Help me understand A yes ha.

894
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:09,000
A yes ha was the love of my life.

895
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:12,600
Love: An intense feeling
of deep affection for someone.

896
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:14,960
Detecting intense feelings.

897
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:18,080
Does that mean you
love Hamid Gul as well?

898
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:21,000
More than you can imagine.

899
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:21,960
Sweet.

900
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:23,280
You can meet him.

901
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:24,800
He is not too far away.

902
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:25,720
What do you mean?

903
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:31,960
I mean he's at 28.38* North,
77.13* East.

904
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:33,280
It can't be.

905
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,240
These coordinates Are in Delhi.

906
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:37,640
Yes, Parliament of India.

907
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:38,960
Hamid is there.

908
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:40,360
What?
Are you sure?

909
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,600
Affirmative. 100% match.

910
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:51,320
Yes?

911
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:52,720
We have orders to go inside.

912
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:54,456
I know.
How many more trucks are expected?

913
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:56,880
I let a couple of RAF trucks
in just a couple of minutes ago.

914
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:59,600
But none of our trucks
have gone inside as yet.

915
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:14,720
Good morning, sir.

916
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:16,040
Good morning, sir.

917
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:17,480
PM's here.

918
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:22,880
Come out.

919
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:25,200
Move.. Move..

920
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:27,360
Move fast.

921
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:29,856
- Hamid's going to attack the Parliament.
- What?

922
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:31,456
- Hamid is going to attack the Parliament!!
- When?

923
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:32,680
Right now.

924
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:45,520
Down! Down! Take cover!

925
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:48,520
Help the forces.
Patrol One. Patrol One, come in.

926
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:23,120
Do you have the PM?

927
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:24,960
He's getting away.

928
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:31,760
These guys in RAF
uniforms are not RAF.

929
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:33,760
They are terrorists.

930
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:35,640
Back off! Back off!
Take cover!

931
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:04,680
Move, move, move.

932
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:06,056
- Get out of our way!
- Move aside.

933
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:07,080
Move!

934
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:31,680
This way, this way.
Go inside.

935
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:33,560
- Hurry.
- Emergency exit, clear.

936
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:35,120
Going for the elevator.

937
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:56,760
I have the PM.

938
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:58,160
Let's go.

939
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,920
Mr. Prime Minister.

940
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:16,640
Who are you?

941
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:23,480
Hamid Gul.

942
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:26,800
Breaking news coming
in right this minute.

943
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:28,296
A terrorist attack
on the Parliament of India.

944
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:31,640
This is believed to be the biggest
ever terrorist attack on India.

945
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:33,640
The stock market
of India has shut down

946
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:36,440
and there is confusion and
chaos on the streets of Delhi.

947
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:39,320
The President of the United
States has condemned the attack.

948
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:42,520
Government officials are
being evacuated as we speak.

949
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:44,920
According to our sources,
Prime Minister was last seen

950
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:47,560
entering the building to
attend the Parliament Session.

951
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:51,160
But we have no news of
whether he is safe or not.

952
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:55,360
NSG commandos are being dropped
off at ground zero as we speak.

953
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:59,400
A high-level war room has been set
up to get the situation under control.

954
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:00,280
The question of the hour is:

955
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:03,200
Who will be the
acting Prime Minister?

956
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:20,520
Okay, guys,
I want everybody's attention here.

957
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:22,336
We are short of time so let's
get straight to the briefing.

958
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:23,640
What do we know so far?

959
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:26,560
LeT terrorists attacked
the Parliament around 11 o'clock.

960
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:29,080
It's estimated that there
are around 100 of them.

961
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:31,920
They have sneaked their own arms
and ammunition inside the building.

962
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:34,616
And now have control over the entire
inner complex of the Parliament.

963
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:35,440
How many hostages?

964
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:38,400
More than 300,
including the Prime Minister.

965
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:39,840
Any contact from inside?

966
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:40,400
None.

967
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:43,176
We've not been able to contact anyone
since 10 minutes after the siege.

968
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:44,336
Everyone's phones
have been switched off.

969
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:45,920
Is Parliament's outer
perimeter secured?

970
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Affirmative.

971
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:48,576
We have surrounded the
building from all sides,

972
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:50,056
and our tactical
response team is about to

973
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:51,936
take a position on the rooftop
of the Parliament via choppers.

974
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:54,736
There's no way anyone is getting out
of that building without us knowing.

975
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:57,120
Clearly, this is a
huge national emergency.

976
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:58,536
As per the Constitution of India,

977
01:06:58,560 --> 01:06:59,920
the senior-most member of the...

978
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:02,680
Cabinet takes over command in the
absence of the Prime Minister,

979
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:05,136
and the powers of the Prime
Minister will be transferred to him.

980
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:07,280
And the Honorable
President has appointed.

981
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:11,320
Home Minister Digvijay Saab
as our Caretaker Prime Minister.

982
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:13,200
Yes, sir.

983
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:15,040
Please.

984
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:24,440
I assure everyone that I will stay
dedicated to this responsibility.

985
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:26,400
- I request everyone...
- What?

986
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:31,360
Terrorists want to communicate.

987
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:32,760
And they are online.

988
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:34,200
Okay guys, stand by.

989
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:35,760
Patch the call.

990
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,160
Patching the call.

991
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:43,560
Greetings.

992
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:45,440
This is Hamid Gul speaking.

993
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:47,920
All your guards are dead.

994
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:50,120
And I have held your PM hostage.

995
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:53,400
I have planted enough
bombs across the building,

996
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:56,200
Enough to blow the ministers to pieces.

997
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:59,280
So, don't even try to get in.

998
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:01,640
I have just three demands.

999
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:04,320
Fulfill them and I will leave.

1000
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:06,120
My first demand:

1001
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:12,480
Call back your tactical team that
has been hovering over our heads.

1002
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,400
You have ten minutes.

1003
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:17,760
In exchange,
I'll release 50 hostages.

1004
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:22,520
You want them dead or alive,
you decide.

1005
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:27,400
Keep me.

1006
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:30,200
Let the others go.

1007
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:40,360
Who do you think you are?

1008
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:45,000
Your VIP days are over.

1009
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:54,040
I'm the one who rules this building now.

1010
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:57,040
I am more powerful
than your Prime Minister.

1011
01:08:57,160 --> 01:09:00,160
The one who rules over this place...

1012
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:04,240
rules over the entire country.

1013
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:15,440
Alpha.. Rappelling down.

1014
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:16,600
Alpha has landed.

1015
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:18,160
Ready for assault.

1016
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:20,640
It's not a bad deal.

1017
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:23,240
He's releasing 50 people.
Ask the commandos to come back.

1018
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:24,480
They are not needed there.

1019
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:25,960
I beg to differ, sir.

1020
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:28,280
We don't negotiate with terrorists.

1021
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:30,256
Let's send the tactical
team inside and kill the bastards.

1022
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:31,920
We cannot take that risk.

1023
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:33,440
Prime Minister is in there as well.

1024
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:37,160
The whole cabinet is in there.
300 people who run this country.

1025
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,480
One wrong decision and
it will all be over.

1026
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:41,040
I think he is right.

1027
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:42,480
He is one step ahead.

1028
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:45,440
And we need time to perform
a proper army action.

1029
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:47,320
We don't know where
he has planted the bombs.

1030
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:49,840
If we send the army blindly,
There's going to be a bloodbath.

1031
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:51,496
So you want us to accept
a terrorist's demand?

1032
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,120
No, no. No, never.

1033
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:56,080
But what if we perform
a partial extraction?

1034
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:59,160
Hamid knows that there
are commandos on the rooftop.

1035
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:01,280
But he doesn't know how
many of them.

1036
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:02,480
So let's accept his demand.

1037
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:04,800
Let him assume that
we have given up.

1038
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:08,120
We will leave just
one commando behind.

1039
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:10,760
He will provide us with
intel from inside the Parliament.

1040
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:15,160
And then we can plan a proper
army action based on that intel.

1041
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:16,640
We are getting time.

1042
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:18,840
Will he release the
hostages if we do this?

1043
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,200
He will, sir.

1044
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,160
We are accepting his demand.

1045
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:26,680
Fine.

1046
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:28,800
Which soldier do you
plan on leaving behind?

1047
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:34,080
- Sir.
- Your squad has been compromised.

1048
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:35,656
Hamid knows that
you guys are up there.

1049
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:37,216
He has threatened to
blow up the Parliament,

1050
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:38,360
unless you get out of there.

1051
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:39,480
Shit.

1052
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:41,360
- Do you want us out?
- Yes and no.

1053
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:42,760
Do a partial extraction.

1054
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:45,360
You stay back and let
the other commandos retreat.

1055
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:49,720
You need to get inside the
building and provide us with intel.

1056
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:51,480
- Do you think it is possible?
- Yes, sir.

1057
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:53,280
- I.R.A. can guide me.
- Good.

1058
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:55,680
Call back the chopper
and put on a loud show.

1059
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:57,840
New channels are desperate
to show some drama.

1060
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,200
I just want Hamid to
believe that NSG is gone.

1061
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:01,520
Copy that.

1062
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:08,376
And we're getting you these
latest images coming in from

1063
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:09,840
the Parliament attack site,

1064
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:12,480
where the NSG choppers
are retreating...

1065
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:15,400
We're not sure about why
the government took this decision

1066
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:18,360
but we do know that Home Minister
Digvijay Singh is in charge right now.

1067
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:21,160
Check the rooftop.

1068
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:22,360
Okay, Brother.

1069
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:25,000
Check everywhere.

1070
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:31,200
Keep an eye.

1071
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:33,480
Nobody is here.

1072
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:40,080
I.R.A., is there a place
where I can hide?

1073
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:41,960
AC vent, 3 o'clock.

1074
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:45,080
Switching to Stealth Mode.

1075
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:49,520
All clear, Brother.

1076
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:54,680
- Hussain?
- Yes, Brother?

1077
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:56,320
Release 50 hostages.

1078
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:08,640
We have live footage
of 50 hostages being released.

1079
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:13,400
They are rushing out of the
Parliament complex as you can see.

1080
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:16,600
But the terrorists still
have control of the Parliament

1081
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:19,560
with 300 hostages inside.

1082
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:27,536
I've given charge of the
CCTV room to Iqbal, Brother.

1083
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:28,320
Okay.

1084
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:30,080
Kill anyone who is hiding.

1085
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:31,760
Okay, Brother.

1086
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:35,200
Arjun, what's your status?

1087
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:36,480
- I'm in.
- Excellent.

1088
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:41,600
Now listen, can you hack the CCTV system
and give us access to the live feed?

1089
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:43,080
- I am sure I.R.A. can.
- Good.

1090
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:44,320
Get on it.

1091
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,800
I.R.A., I want blueprints
of the Parliament.

1092
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:49,480
Projecting 3D model
of the Parliament.

1093
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:54,200
Identify camera blind spots for me.

1094
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:56,120
Identifying.

1095
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:08,320
The Metro job will
be done in three hours.

1096
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:10,640
And how long will this take?

1097
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:13,000
Two are online, four more are left.

1098
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:14,840
Their Army will strike
before you are done.

1099
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:16,520
They won't.

1100
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:17,960
How can you be so sure?

1101
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:21,080
Do you know the reason behind
frequent military coups back home?

1102
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:21,840
No.

1103
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:26,040
Because our military knows
the government holds no power.

1104
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:28,040
Their military is foolish.

1105
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:30,320
They will do as
told by the ministers.

1106
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:35,400
And as long as we
hold their PM hostage,

1107
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:39,960
their Home Minister won't even
let the military kill a fly.

1108
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,840
Sir, 50 hostages are out, unharmed.

1109
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:45,440
Should I tweet this on your behalf?

1110
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:46,080
Go ahead.

1111
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:48,016
It's a false victory,
the terrorists have an upper hand.

1112
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:50,160
It's subjective.
Depends on how you see it!

1113
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:09,160
Guys, alert.

1114
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:10,480
Hamid online.

1115
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:12,200
My second demand:

1116
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:14,440
Release Rehman Gul.

1117
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:19,280
You have our leader
and we have yours.

1118
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:21,360
It's the perfect exchange offer.

1119
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:24,040
I know how slow your
government officials are.

1120
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:29,280
Therefore,
I am giving you an hour to decide.

1121
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:36,720
Everything is under control.

1122
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:38,360
There is no movement
in the corridor.

1123
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:53,480
Up linking all CCTV feed
to emergency ops war room.

1124
01:14:57,680 --> 01:14:59,680
Stop. Stop.

1125
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:03,080
Sir. Live feed.

1126
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:04,800
I want every frame to be recorded.

1127
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:06,440
Yeah, keep it running.

1128
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:10,176
Let's plan our entry.
Give me the blueprint.

1129
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:11,360
Okay, listen to me.

1130
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:12,320
Now, this is the main door.

1131
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:14,680
Gentlemen, what is our
decision on Hamid's demand?

1132
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:16,640
We are about the hit the deadline.

1133
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:18,920
We have two options, sir.

1134
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:20,720
First option: Army action.

1135
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:21,960
I recommend this.

1136
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:23,400
We have the live feed.

1137
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:26,200
My commandos will be ready
for assault in 20 minutes, sir.

1138
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:28,840
Can you guarantee
Prime Minister's safety?

1139
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:32,040
Chances of the PM's survival
are the same as that of the others.

1140
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:34,120
Then the army won't go in.

1141
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:37,160
How will we save our country if
we cannot save our Prime Minister?

1142
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:42,080
I won't give the permission to attack,
Until I'm assured of the PM's safety.

1143
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:44,160
What's the second option?

1144
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:46,120
Second option: Negotiation.

1145
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:49,680
We can offer Hamid a hefty
sum to release the Prime Minister.

1146
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:51,560
And I would strongly recommend that.

1147
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:52,760
Agreed.

1148
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:54,880
Offer him money.
That's what everyone wants

1149
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,960
Hamid is not here
to rob a bank, sir.

1150
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:58,496
- He's a hardcore terrorist-
- What other option do we have?

1151
01:15:58,520 --> 01:15:59,536
Should we release Rehman Gul?

1152
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:01,960
The most viable option
is right in front of you. Arjun.

1153
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:03,800
Please give him some time.

1154
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:05,880
So you want us to trust
that soldier to come good?

1155
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:08,960
That one soldier has
the strength of a battalion.

1156
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:11,000
And what if he fails?

1157
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:14,360
Then we'll do as you say.

1158
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:32,520
Sir.

1159
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:34,160
Hamid has made another demand.

1160
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:35,960
Let me guess, he wants Rehman Gul?

1161
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:36,680
Yes.

1162
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,520
I fear that the Home
Minister might give in.

1163
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,680
This is the first time
we are so close to Hamid.

1164
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:41,520
Let's crush him.

1165
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:43,921
Yes, I am working on that.
But Home Minister is in charge,

1166
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:46,480
and I think this guy is madly
in love with the Prime Minister.

1167
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:49,240
I don't think he'll let
us attack until the PM is safe.

1168
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:51,840
So, for now, you are being
ordered to just do a recce.

1169
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:56,000
And quickly find a way for the army to
get in without setting off the bombs.

1170
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:57,400
On it, sir.

1171
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:08,920
Shit.

1172
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:10,240
Stop.

1173
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:27,120
Stop. Tripwire.

1174
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:30,400
Hussain? Mallik?

1175
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:35,000
Where's Hussain?

1176
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:36,560
What are you hiding?

1177
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:41,840
No one's coming to rescue you.

1178
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:44,080
Where's Hussain, Mustafa?

1179
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:46,600
He went after the girl.

1180
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:49,120
That fucking skirt chaser.

1181
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:50,400
Let's go.

1182
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:53,360
I.R.A.?

1183
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:55,840
Remote detonated explosive devices.

1184
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:58,560
20 kg RDX bombs on all entrances.

1185
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:00,320
You want help?

1186
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:04,560
I've got you.
I've got you.

1187
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:05,840
Alert.

1188
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:08,360
Message from
Sabah's smart watch.

1189
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:10,040
"Help".

1190
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:12,320
What else are you hiding in there?

1191
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:16,520
You...!

1192
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:18,920
So, you think you can take me on?

1193
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:24,000
Sir, the library.

1194
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:35,720
Damn it.

1195
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:36,840
Oh, shit.

1196
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:38,400
Let me show you want I can do.

1197
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:41,000
It's time you feel the heat.

1198
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:46,760
No.. No..

1199
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:49,840
Sir, see this.

1200
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:52,040
Hamid too is proceeding
towards the library.

1201
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:54,720
No.. No..

1202
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:00,920
Arjun, don't.

1203
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:02,520
Hamid's headed your way.

1204
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:03,920
- Don't do anything.
- But, sir...

1205
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:05,296
It will put the
whole mission at risk.

1206
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:06,936
You'll expose yourself
as soon as you fire that gun.

1207
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:08,360
Arjun, put the gun down.

1208
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:11,240
He's coming.

1209
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:16,320
No.

1210
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:17,280
No.

1211
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:19,240
Arjun, I know what you are thinking.

1212
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:20,680
Don't go in.
Don't go in.

1213
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:23,320
Arjun, he's coming. Don't go in.

1214
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:24,880
Arjun?

1215
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:26,160
Arjun, are you listening?

1216
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:27,040
It's my order.

1217
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:28,160
I am sorry, sir.

1218
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:30,040
- I can't take this anymore.
- Stop him.

1219
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:31,960
Arjun... Arjun, please!

1220
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:33,840
Arjun, don't go in!

1221
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:39,120
Don't go in.

1222
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:41,800
No!

1223
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:48,000
Hussain?

1224
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:49,280
Hussain?

1225
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:51,080
Hussain?

1226
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:53,080
Hussain?

1227
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:24,520
There's someone in
the building apart from us.

1228
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:28,600
Highly skilled.

1229
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:44,480
Heard that?

1230
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:45,720
Drilling?

1231
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:48,760
I need to go outside.

1232
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:52,040
Lock the door.
Stay safe, stay inside.

1233
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:54,720
Wear this.

1234
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:57,240
If anyone touches you,
just shoot him.

1235
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:02,240
Arjun?

1236
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,120
Be careful.

1237
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:06,760
You and I.R.A.
aren't completely synced yet.

1238
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:08,840
Anything can happen in real-time.

1239
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:10,320
I.R.A. can even shut down.

1240
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:12,360
Don't worry, I will.

1241
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:21,840
Someone has hacked it, Brother.

1242
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:23,680
Live feed is being relayed outside.

1243
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:25,640
Cut it off.

1244
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:29,080
Go offline.

1245
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:32,560
Pull the plug.

1246
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:35,840
Sir, they cut the
live feed from the Parliament.

1247
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:37,320
We cannot trust him.

1248
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:38,440
I had warned you.

1249
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:39,920
Sir, he will come good.

1250
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:41,240
You still think so?

1251
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:42,760
He disobeyed your direct order.

1252
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:44,496
But it's his moral
duty to save that girl...

1253
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:45,360
Don't bother.

1254
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:46,920
I have been given
the responsibility.

1255
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:48,200
I am in charge.

1256
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:49,480
Like you said.

1257
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:51,400
I make all the decisions henceforth.

1258
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:53,200
Sukrut?

1259
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:57,880
Oh hero!

1260
01:21:58,360 --> 01:22:00,600
I know you are here.

1261
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:04,880
Switch your walkie
to frequency 463.65.

1262
01:22:05,480 --> 01:22:07,560
I think it's time we know
each other a little better.

1263
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:13,280
You already know what I can do.

1264
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:15,280
You'll soon know who I am as well.

1265
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:20,280
What are you trying
to achieve from all this?

1266
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:25,360
You think you can save your country
by killing a couple of my men?

1267
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,120
And then what?

1268
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:28,840
A promotion?

1269
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:31,560
A medal of honor, maybe?

1270
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:34,280
A happier ending?

1271
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:39,560
Let me describe your ending to you.

1272
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:43,200
Your body will be lying
here among the other dead bodies.

1273
01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:46,440
And It won't even take two days
for your country to forget you.

1274
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:53,360
You're making tall claims, kiddo.

1275
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:57,400
Don't bother about my ending,
yours is going to be a tragic one.

1276
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:01,920
Why don't you show yourself
if you are that confident?

1277
01:23:02,120 --> 01:23:03,120
Why are you hiding?

1278
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:04,240
You sure you want that?

1279
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:08,200
You might wet your pants again.

1280
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:14,120
November 25th, 2010, remember?

1281
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:30,240
You are the same soldier!

1282
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:34,520
How wonderful!

1283
01:23:34,640 --> 01:23:36,240
What a pleasant coincidence,
Brother!

1284
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:37,480
I am so happy.

1285
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:38,880
It's not a coincidence.

1286
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:41,800
You owe me your life.

1287
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:44,360
Come on then, let's settle this.

1288
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:49,600
I'm already on it.

1289
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:56,920
Well, there's a call.

1290
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:58,080
Alert!

1291
01:23:58,200 --> 01:23:59,280
Don't.

1292
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,120
Sukrut, you talk to him.

1293
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:05,000
Yes, sir.

1294
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:09,480
I told you not to do it!

1295
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:12,880
Didn't I?
I told you not to enter the parliament!

1296
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,040
Hamid, just forget what happened.

1297
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:17,040
Government of India
has an offer for you.

1298
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:19,240
We'll give you a safe passage

1299
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:21,600
and 10 million dollars to
let the Prime Minister go.

1300
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:23,080
What do you think?

1301
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:24,920
You think you can just
buy me off like that?

1302
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,040
- Are you on speakerphone?
- Yes.

1303
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:29,880
- State your name.
- Sukrut.

1304
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:33,640
- State your name.
- Pritam Singh, MP Uttar Pradesh.

1305
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:35,440
P... P... Pritam Singh.

1306
01:24:36,680 --> 01:24:38,720
You are responsible for his death.

1307
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:41,680
NO!

1308
01:24:42,360 --> 01:24:44,200
Quiet!
You, come here!

1309
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:47,760
Come on.

1310
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:50,160
State your name.
State your name!

1311
01:24:50,280 --> 01:24:53,000
Wait, we are ready
to accept all your demands.

1312
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:55,000
You have no other option.

1313
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:57,840
But first, you have to
hand that commando over to me.

1314
01:24:58,120 --> 01:25:00,240
Else, I'll shoot the Prime Minister
next. Got it?

1315
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:01,600
Okay, we'll take care of it.

1316
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:08,000
You call that a negotiation?

1317
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:09,600
That man is capable
of doing anything.

1318
01:25:09,680 --> 01:25:11,360
Release Rehman Gul immediately.

1319
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:12,760
This is wrong.

1320
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:16,480
I am sorry sir, but I won't
take orders from a terrorist.

1321
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:17,600
It's my order.

1322
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:18,920
You don't get it, sir.

1323
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:20,640
This is sending a wrong signal.

1324
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:23,600
This will only encourage
others to follow suit.

1325
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:25,296
We'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

1326
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:26,760
You are to do as I say.

1327
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:28,440
This will save lives.

1328
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:30,520
You are putting the future
of our country at risk.

1329
01:25:30,720 --> 01:25:32,336
And I will not stand
by and let this happen, sir.

1330
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:34,080
- Then resign.
- Sir? Sir!

1331
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:35,760
I won't change my decision.

1332
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:38,120
Don't forget that I am
the acting Prime Minister.

1333
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:41,376
I won't let my country
surrender under my watch.

1334
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:43,800
The Indian Army does
not negotiate with terrorists.

1335
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,440
NG, you are in charge here.
Call me when you need army action.

1336
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:56,320
Sir, what about that soldier?

1337
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:58,120
Hmm?

1338
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:00,040
Ask that soldier to surrender.

1339
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:01,760
Right away.

1340
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:05,600
Arjun, come in.

1341
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:07,680
- Sir.
- My hands are tied.

1342
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:09,840
Surrender to Hamid immediately.

1343
01:26:10,120 --> 01:26:11,976
So we're throwing our hands
up before a terrorist now?

1344
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,000
How dare you blame us?

1345
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:15,640
Your shenanigan to save
that girl got a minister killed.

1346
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:18,880
In battle, when a fellow soldier dies,
we don't surrender.

1347
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,040
We keep fighting for
his honor and sacrifice, sir.

1348
01:26:21,160 --> 01:26:22,960
Handle him, Subramanium.

1349
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:25,800
Our soldiers have become
quite high spirited these days.

1350
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:26,960
Listen, Arjun.

1351
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:30,200
Hamid can kill more people
just to prove his point.

1352
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:31,640
We are past the deadline.

1353
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:34,360
And we are being forced to
release Rehman Gul to stop him.

1354
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:37,080
Go to Hamid and end this.

1355
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:39,400
I repeat, just end it.

1356
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:42,640
Yes, sir.

1357
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:49,160
I know what you are thinking.

1358
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:50,000
Good.

1359
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:51,800
You won't follow the orders.

1360
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:53,680
I guess you didn't hear him.

1361
01:26:54,160 --> 01:26:56,040
"Go to Hamid and end this."

1362
01:26:56,280 --> 01:26:57,280
Exactly.

1363
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:58,680
That is the order.

1364
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:01,320
We go in and end Hamid.

1365
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:02,840
Okay. But what's the plan?

1366
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:04,280
Just read my mind.

1367
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:14,296
Found him! Stay there and Don't move!

1368
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:16,096
On your knees! On your knees now!
Hands in the air!

1369
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:17,480
He killed Hussain!

1370
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:20,080
We should shoot him right away!

1371
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:21,640
Don't move!

1372
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:23,280
You killed Hussain.

1373
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:28,120
You're a dead man now!

1374
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:42,640
Initializing stimulation.

1375
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:46,400
89 hostiles confirmed.

1376
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:48,120
High-grade weapons.

1377
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:56,680
Locking target.

1378
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:01,960
Sir.

1379
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:05,440
- Don't walk with pride.
- We need to engage.

1380
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:07,360
No, I.R.A.. Let him get closer.

1381
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:10,240
We attack in 3, 2...

1382
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:12,840
Chip malfunctioning.

1383
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:14,280
Chip-chip-chip Malfunctioning.

1384
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:15,400
I.R.A., no.

1385
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:18,120
So I'll be wetting my pants, huh?

1386
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,640
Body resistance going down.

1387
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:23,640
40%

1388
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:26,040
Look who they sent to rescue you.

1389
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:28,760
20%

1390
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:30,880
India's savior!

1391
01:28:37,080 --> 01:28:38,520
Arjun, come in.
Arjun?

1392
01:28:39,160 --> 01:28:41,000
- Arjun?
- I.R.A. has shut down, sir.

1393
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:42,400
No signal.

1394
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:43,720
What?

1395
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:45,440
Shit.

1396
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:50,720
Hey, Mr. Paradise!

1397
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:54,000
Let's go. It's time
to go back to your country.

1398
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:01,280
You okay, sir?

1399
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:06,600
May I have a word with you?

1400
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:10,480
Sir, they cannot control Hamid.

1401
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:12,600
If things go south,
all the blame will fall on you.

1402
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:13,440
Why will they blame me?

1403
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:15,520
The blame always
falls on the PM, sir.

1404
01:29:15,640 --> 01:29:17,680
The job you are "acting"
for is a tough one.

1405
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:19,880
You'll be the first
one asked to resign.

1406
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:23,600
Let Subramanium make
all the decisions henceforth.

1407
01:29:23,720 --> 01:29:26,400
You might have to shift the
blame while talking to the media.

1408
01:29:27,160 --> 01:29:28,240
Hmm.

1409
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:05,440
Take my father to Rawalkotla
and release him at the airport.

1410
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:11,680
Give him a satellite phone so that
I can talk to him as he travels.

1411
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:16,200
We'll discuss the rest once
he is out of Indian airspace.

1412
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:47,800
What a surprise!

1413
01:30:52,160 --> 01:30:53,320
You okay?

1414
01:30:53,960 --> 01:30:55,320
Come with me?

1415
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:58,840
We are also seeing these
patterns for the first time.

1416
01:31:01,240 --> 01:31:03,960
Arjun, come on you're dreaming.

1417
01:31:12,120 --> 01:31:14,800
I.R.A. is like a screen saver.

1418
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:18,880
It will show the visuals
from your past memories.

1419
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:27,400
A yes ha, will you marry me?

1420
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:30,920
Yes.

1421
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:32,720
Yes!

1422
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:43,520
My last demand.

1423
01:31:43,960 --> 01:31:46,520
I want a safe passage
to get out of here.

1424
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:51,280
A GAR airline flight leaves for Ecuador
from IG Airport in 45 minutes.

1425
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:54,040
Keep it ready for us at Gate No. 47.

1426
01:31:54,160 --> 01:31:56,200
We will leave from here in our cars.

1427
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:58,600
Once we leave the Indian airspace,

1428
01:31:58,720 --> 01:32:01,560
I'll disarm the bombs
via a remote detonator.

1429
01:32:01,720 --> 01:32:06,640
Touch the doors before that

1430
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:12,400
and all the bombs will go BOOM!

1431
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:15,080
So do we have a deal?

1432
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:17,760
Speak up, Uncle.

1433
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:22,880
Okay.

1434
01:32:23,240 --> 01:32:24,360
We have a deal.

1435
01:32:24,640 --> 01:32:26,080
I won't call back.

1436
01:32:43,160 --> 01:32:44,840
Us man! Khalid!

1437
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:46,480
Get them out of here.

1438
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:48,400
Keep moving!

1439
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:49,680
Go!

1440
01:32:50,160 --> 01:32:52,360
Fast.

1441
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:53,640
Saqlain?

1442
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:56,280
Is it done?

1443
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:57,720
It is ready, Brother.

1444
01:32:58,760 --> 01:32:59,840
What's the pass code?

1445
01:32:59,960 --> 01:33:01,160
My birthday.

1446
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:02,400
What?

1447
01:33:04,520 --> 01:33:06,000
My brave warrior!

1448
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:08,680
What are you doing, Brother?

1449
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:14,720
Father will reach
Rawalkotla in 20 minutes.

1450
01:33:14,840 --> 01:33:16,600
And we'll be at the airport.

1451
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:17,600
Detonator.

1452
01:33:17,720 --> 01:33:19,000
You have the briefcase, right?

1453
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:23,480
Use this switch in case
you need to detonate it sooner.

1454
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:25,480
Are you confident that
no one can defuse it?

1455
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:26,960
100%, Brother.

1456
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:30,120
There are six blasting
caps and six firing circuits.

1457
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:32,280
No one can defuse it
in less than 20 minutes.

1458
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:33,640
But you can?

1459
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:36,040
Of course, Brother.
I made it, so I can defuse it.

1460
01:33:36,160 --> 01:33:37,240
Good job.

1461
01:33:37,680 --> 01:33:39,280
Well done.

1462
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:40,640
Thanks, Brother.

1463
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:45,280
Brother? Brother?

1464
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:53,400
- Mustafa.
- Yes, Brother.

1465
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:55,800
Jihadists are treated
like kings in heaven.

1466
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:57,600
You are going to heaven, my brother.

1467
01:33:57,720 --> 01:33:59,920
This bomb has to
explode at any cost.

1468
01:34:00,040 --> 01:34:01,760
The army will try to get in.

1469
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:04,040
Make sure there's a bloodbath.

1470
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:07,600
We have only broken their backbone.

1471
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:10,120
Now it's time to kill India's spirit.

1472
01:34:10,240 --> 01:34:11,560
God willing, soon.

1473
01:34:11,680 --> 01:34:14,080
- Goodbye, my friend.
- Goodbye, Gul.

1474
01:34:24,240 --> 01:34:27,240
Inform General Singh that
Hamid is leaving the Parliament.

1475
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:28,960
Let's ambush him at the airport.

1476
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:31,160
- But sir, under whose authority?
- Mine.

1477
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:33,560
No more negotiations.
Let's kill that bastard.

1478
01:34:33,680 --> 01:34:34,760
Yes, sir.

1479
01:34:35,960 --> 01:34:38,280
Get in, everyone. Quick, go.

1480
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:45,480
Sir.
They are moving.

1481
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:10,040
What's wrong?

1482
01:35:11,320 --> 01:35:12,640
You can't stay here.

1483
01:35:15,680 --> 01:35:17,600
You want to leave me?

1484
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:20,640
I have already left, Arjun.

1485
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:22,200
I am gone.

1486
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:27,080
But still..

1487
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:32,000
I am here only to
tell you how much I love you.

1488
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:39,560
We have spent very
little time together,

1489
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:48,360
but those were the most
beautiful days of my life.

1490
01:35:49,320 --> 01:35:51,840
I know you've been through a lot.

1491
01:35:52,840 --> 01:35:59,720
But believe me, you have
a beautiful future ahead of you.

1492
01:36:01,320 --> 01:36:04,400
But now, you need to let go.

1493
01:36:05,280 --> 01:36:06,920
You need to let go.

1494
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:09,200
It's synchronising.

1495
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:12,360
Will you do that for me, my darling?

1496
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:14,400
I love you.

1497
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:17,000
You know I love you more.

1498
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:25,960
A yes ha?

1499
01:36:29,080 --> 01:36:34,000
Life will try to hold you down,
but this journey must always go on.

1500
01:36:53,680 --> 01:36:54,880
*Machine Voice*

1501
01:36:58,280 --> 01:36:59,520
Welcome back, Arjun.

1502
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:37,200
Left.

1503
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:38,680
Right.

1504
01:37:44,120 --> 01:37:46,560
Path is clear.
NSG deployed at the airport.

1505
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:48,680
Grenade.

1506
01:38:53,560 --> 01:38:56,440
30 minutes.
It's all we have. Take a detour.

1507
01:39:41,560 --> 01:39:44,120
Clear all civilians from
the airport radius. Over.

1508
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:21,040
Airport in sight.
Army personnel on standby.

1509
01:40:21,160 --> 01:40:23,040
Snipers in place.

1510
01:40:32,120 --> 01:40:32,880
Bomb active.

1511
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,880
- 20:24 seconds to the blast.
- What?

1512
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:37,080
Can we defuse it?

1513
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:39,360
Not possible.
We don't have time.

1514
01:40:39,480 --> 01:40:41,216
Then we need to get
the hostages out of here.

1515
01:40:41,240 --> 01:40:44,200
Survival chance is zero.
This is a chemical bomb.

1516
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:45,080
What?

1517
01:40:45,200 --> 01:40:48,240
Sarin gas, affective radius 30kms.

1518
01:40:48,360 --> 01:40:50,560
- Shit-shit-shit-shit-shit!
- Come in for Arjun.

1519
01:40:50,680 --> 01:40:52,680
Sir, Arjun's comms are on.

1520
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:55,560
- Arjun, come in.
- Where's Hamid, sir?

1521
01:40:55,720 --> 01:40:57,200
We'll be ambushing
him at the airport.

1522
01:40:57,320 --> 01:40:58,456
We don't have that much time.

1523
01:40:58,480 --> 01:41:01,000
He activated a chemical bomb
before he left the Parliament.

1524
01:41:01,120 --> 01:41:02,840
Sarin gas.
I repeat sir, it's Sarin gas.

1525
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:04,560
Half of Delhi will
be dead in 20 minutes.

1526
01:41:04,680 --> 01:41:06,000
- What!
- Intercept Hamid now!

1527
01:41:06,120 --> 01:41:08,760
Intercept the car!
Intercept it right now!

1528
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:10,320
- Where's he?
- Check for Hamid Gul.

1529
01:41:10,440 --> 01:41:11,960
We need a positive match.

1530
01:41:22,320 --> 01:41:24,480
No one shoots!
I repeat no one shoots!

1531
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:25,920
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

1532
01:41:26,040 --> 01:41:27,040
I am Nitaraj Swammy, MP.

1533
01:41:27,080 --> 01:41:28,176
They told us to go to the airport

1534
01:41:28,200 --> 01:41:29,680
or else they'll blow up this vest.

1535
01:41:31,680 --> 01:41:32,560
No bombs.

1536
01:41:32,680 --> 01:41:34,080
Hamid is not in the car, sir.

1537
01:41:34,200 --> 01:41:36,280
- Hamid is not in the car.
- Hamid is not in the car?

1538
01:41:38,440 --> 01:41:39,600
Then where is he?

1539
01:41:46,360 --> 01:41:48,440
- Move on! Move on! Move on!
- Arjun, it was a decoy.

1540
01:41:48,520 --> 01:41:49,520
Sir.

1541
01:41:49,560 --> 01:41:50,840
Hamid never left the Parliament.

1542
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:52,776
Sir, that's impossible. Sir.
Hamid is not here.

1543
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:54,376
He wouldn't stay here
after activating the bomb...

1544
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:55,400
Wait, wait, wait.

1545
01:41:55,520 --> 01:41:56,400
The drilling.

1546
01:41:56,520 --> 01:41:58,160
I.R.A., the Parliament blueprints.

1547
01:42:03,960 --> 01:42:05,160
Projecting.

1548
01:42:05,480 --> 01:42:06,160
What's that?

1549
01:42:06,280 --> 01:42:08,120
It's a tunnel,
made by the Britishers.

1550
01:42:08,360 --> 01:42:09,360
Where's the exit?

1551
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:10,280
No exit.

1552
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:12,040
The Indian government had sealed it.

1553
01:42:12,160 --> 01:42:13,800
But looks like there
has been a breach.

1554
01:42:14,120 --> 01:42:15,120
Go, go, go!

1555
01:42:15,240 --> 01:42:16,680
Sabah, you have 15 minutes.

1556
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:18,120
Get the hostages out at all cost.

1557
01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:19,320
Quick, go.

1558
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:24,880
Arjun, did you get Hamid?

1559
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:26,200
No, sir.
He set us up.

1560
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:27,896
They drilled a hole from
the underground metro site.

1561
01:42:27,920 --> 01:42:29,520
To the old tunnel
beneath the Parliament.

1562
01:42:29,680 --> 01:42:31,136
It must have taken
them months to do it.

1563
01:42:31,160 --> 01:42:32,456
This has been his plan all along.

1564
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:36,240
Negotiations, Rehman Gul, airport safe
passage were nothing but delay tactics.

1565
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:39,760
He was buying time
to plant a chemical bomb

1566
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:43,560
while we waited at the
airport for him like fools!

1567
01:42:56,520 --> 01:42:59,120
I.R.A., scan CCTV for Hamid.

1568
01:42:59,880 --> 01:43:00,880
Scanning.

1569
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:03,880
Sir, I found him.

1570
01:43:04,160 --> 01:43:06,240
Arjun, get him.
He has a remote detonator.

1571
01:43:06,360 --> 01:43:07,680
And that's our only hope.

1572
01:43:07,800 --> 01:43:09,320
Copy that.
Send backup.

1573
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:13,000
Send SOS to the Army Chief.

1574
01:43:13,120 --> 01:43:14,696
He needs to set up a
20km perimeter in the city

1575
01:43:14,720 --> 01:43:17,320
and initiate emergency protocol.
Hurry!

1576
01:43:27,200 --> 01:43:29,080
Stop, stop, stop.
Stop. Stop.

1577
01:43:29,320 --> 01:43:31,080
Back off, everybody. Back off.

1578
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:42,400
Hamid moving towards Safdarjang airport
25 kilometres away.

1579
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:46,640
What is this gas?

1580
01:43:46,760 --> 01:43:48,560
It's 26 times more
poisonous than cyanide.

1581
01:43:48,680 --> 01:43:50,960
When the bomb explodes,
it'll spread all across Delhi.

1582
01:43:51,080 --> 01:43:51,840
People will die as soon
as they breathe it.

1583
01:43:51,960 --> 01:43:53,120
Evacuate the city then.

1584
01:43:53,240 --> 01:43:54,560
We have less than 15 minutes.

1585
01:43:54,680 --> 01:43:55,856
Mass evacuation is impossible.

1586
01:43:55,880 --> 01:43:57,840
Emergency responders
won't be able to do anything.

1587
01:43:58,480 --> 01:43:59,800
Prime Minister?

1588
01:44:03,640 --> 01:44:06,680
There's a bomb here. Back off.

1589
01:44:15,880 --> 01:44:17,920
10 minutes to blast.

1590
01:44:42,240 --> 01:44:43,656
We need to look for an alternate route.

1591
01:44:43,680 --> 01:44:45,280
A short cut.

1592
01:44:45,800 --> 01:44:47,280
Re-calibrating route.

1593
01:44:47,400 --> 01:44:48,600
Fast.

1594
01:44:48,760 --> 01:44:50,240
Take a right.

1595
01:44:51,040 --> 01:44:52,400
- Go.
- Yes, sir.

1596
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:02,040
Bike engine on fire.

1597
01:45:16,120 --> 01:45:17,880
Emergency flight request
has been cleared.

1598
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,760
Airbus Argus B-12
is ready for takeoff, sir.

1599
01:45:26,920 --> 01:45:28,720
- Airstrip is clear.
- Hurry!

1600
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:30,240
On it, sir.

1601
01:45:38,600 --> 01:45:40,240
Sir, someone's on the runway.

1602
01:45:40,360 --> 01:45:41,640
- What?
- Someone is there.

1603
01:45:43,040 --> 01:45:44,280
Rascal.

1604
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:46,080
Go, go, go. Hurry!

1605
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:56,640
Take off right now.

1606
01:45:57,480 --> 01:45:58,640
Take off!

1607
01:46:01,560 --> 01:46:03,640
Engine on full throttle.
Taking off.

1608
01:46:04,840 --> 01:46:06,400
Now! Take off!

1609
01:46:09,520 --> 01:46:10,880
Take off.

1610
01:46:58,560 --> 01:46:59,880
35 seconds to the blast.

1611
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,800
Press red switch to disengage.

1612
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:04,440
Remote signal lost.

1613
01:47:09,040 --> 01:47:10,040
I.R.A.!

1614
01:47:12,640 --> 01:47:13,640
Shit.

1615
01:47:27,320 --> 01:47:28,440
Is that all?

1616
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:32,920
This wasn't the main bomb.

1617
01:47:33,520 --> 01:47:34,840
Then what was it?

1618
01:47:39,200 --> 01:47:40,400
Everyone, ready?

1619
01:48:01,880 --> 01:48:03,840
Sir! The hostages are coming out.

1620
01:48:03,960 --> 01:48:05,160
Get them into safe perimeters.

1621
01:48:05,240 --> 01:48:08,120
Yeah, move! Ambulance,
doctors, everyone. Get them there.

1622
01:48:16,720 --> 01:48:18,280
What about the gas bomb?

1623
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:20,040
It has been deactivated.

1624
01:48:20,320 --> 01:48:21,360
How?

1625
01:48:27,680 --> 01:48:28,680
How do I stop it?

1626
01:48:28,760 --> 01:48:31,080
Cut the red wire exactly when I say.

1627
01:48:31,200 --> 01:48:33,360
- There are two red wires, I.R.A..
- The top one.

1628
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:36,840
Steady.

1629
01:48:39,880 --> 01:48:42,920
In 3, 2, 1... cut!

1630
01:48:44,080 --> 01:48:45,920
Deactivation sequence initiated.

1631
01:49:16,080 --> 01:49:17,320
100% sync.

1632
01:49:21,040 --> 01:49:22,960
Sir, we have the Prime Minister.

1633
01:49:38,520 --> 01:49:39,640
Well done, Arjun.

1634
01:49:39,880 --> 01:49:41,360
I knew you could do it.

1635
01:49:41,480 --> 01:49:42,480
Thank you, sir.

1636
01:49:42,840 --> 01:49:43,680
What about Rehman Gul.

1637
01:49:43,800 --> 01:49:45,320
We have taken care of that.

1638
01:49:45,560 --> 01:49:48,400
He was fighting for his land,
we offered him the sky instead.

1639
01:49:55,160 --> 01:49:56,160
That's great.

1640
01:49:56,520 --> 01:49:57,600
Permission to go home, sir.

1641
01:49:57,680 --> 01:49:59,080
Permission granted, my soldier.

1642
01:49:59,200 --> 01:50:00,320
Permission granted.

1643
01:50:12,400 --> 01:50:14,160
Sir, shall I
tweet from your account?

1644
01:50:14,280 --> 01:50:15,280
Hmm?

1645
01:50:15,360 --> 01:50:17,880
Yes, post it everywhere
Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.

1646
01:50:18,200 --> 01:50:19,760
Tell everyone that I saved our country.

1647
01:50:25,520 --> 01:50:27,640
Hail Mother India!

1648
01:50:27,760 --> 01:50:29,960
Hail Mother India!

1649
01:50:30,120 --> 01:50:32,080
Hail Mother India!

1650
01:50:32,200 --> 01:50:34,280
Hail Mother India!

1651
01:50:36,360 --> 01:50:37,360
Hospital.
