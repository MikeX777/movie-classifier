[man]
I deserve good things.

23
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,833
I am entitled to
my share of happiness.

24
00:02:02,867 --> 00:02:05,267
I refuse to beat myself up.

25
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:10,133
I am an attractive person.
I am fun to be with.

Stuart smalley
is a caring nurturer,

27
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,833
a member of several
12-step programs,

28
00:02:23,867 --> 00:02:26,400
but not a licensed therapist.

29
00:02:26,433 --> 00:02:29,400
I'm going to do
a terrific show today,

30
00:02:29,433 --> 00:02:32,133
and I'm going to help people

31
00:02:32,167 --> 00:02:35,767
because I'm good enough,
I'm smart enough,

32
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,833
and doggone it,
people like me.

33
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,767
Hello. I'm Stuart smalley,

34
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,833
and as you know,
I am a perfectionist,

35
00:02:43,867 --> 00:02:46,767
which is one of my problems,

36
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,267
and that's o.K.
Because I own my perfectionism.

37
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,333
Anyway, because I am
a perfectionist,

38
00:02:53,367 --> 00:02:56,367
I tend to be very rigid,

39
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,400
but today,
I've decided to take a risk

40
00:02:59,433 --> 00:03:01,400
and wear a new sweater.

41
00:03:01,433 --> 00:03:03,400
It was sent to me

42
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:06,400
by a recovering sex addict,
Melissa d.,

43
00:03:06,433 --> 00:03:08,400
who knitted it herself.

44
00:03:08,433 --> 00:03:12,900
She said it gave her
something to do with her hands.

45
00:03:12,933 --> 00:03:14,867
And Melissa writes,

46
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,833
"your show
is a lifesaver.

47
00:03:16,867 --> 00:03:18,767
"Since it is on at noon,

48
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,333
"it allows me to put
the focus on me,

49
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,767
"where it belongs,

50
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,233
and keep it there
for the rest of the day."

51
00:03:26,267 --> 00:03:30,400
Well, Melissa,
I have some bad news

52
00:03:30,433 --> 00:03:33,400
because I was just told

53
00:03:33,433 --> 00:03:37,400
by a certain person
who shall go nameless

54
00:03:37,433 --> 00:03:42,400
that my show
will no longer air at noon,

55
00:03:42,433 --> 00:03:47,900
that from now on,
it will be on at 2:45 A.M.,

56
00:03:47,933 --> 00:03:53,167
following a hair-replacement
infomercial,

57
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,700
and I am very angry,
and that's o.K.

58
00:03:56,733 --> 00:04:00,833
I now realize that I am
entitled to my anger,

59
00:04:00,867 --> 00:04:03,267
and that's a big step for me

60
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,433
because I used to be afraid
of my anger,

61
00:04:06,467 --> 00:04:09,067
and that's why
I stuffed my anger

62
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:13,400
and why I also stuffed my face,

63
00:04:13,433 --> 00:04:17,400
which is why I weighed
nearly 300 pounds,

64
00:04:17,433 --> 00:04:22,400
you know, before I got into
o.A., overeaters anonymous,

65
00:04:22,433 --> 00:04:27,233
which is where the person
who made this decision,

66
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:32,100
roz weinstock, belongs,
if you ask me,

67
00:04:32,133 --> 00:04:36,267
because she is a grandiose,
shame-based overeater,

68
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:41,367
sick in her own disease,
and weighs over 200 pounds

69
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,967
and has a hideous haircut.

70
00:04:47,767 --> 00:04:49,400
O.k., I'm sorry.

71
00:04:49,433 --> 00:04:50,900
Um...

72
00:04:50,933 --> 00:04:54,400
That was a big mistake.

73
00:04:54,433 --> 00:04:58,733
I probably shouldn't have
said that.

74
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:11,900
I just can't believe
I did that.

75
00:05:11,933 --> 00:05:13,900
So you made a mistake.

76
00:05:13,933 --> 00:05:15,400
Human beings
make mistakes.

77
00:05:15,433 --> 00:05:16,900
Oh, thank you.

78
00:05:16,933 --> 00:05:18,433
That's
very comforting.

79
00:05:18,467 --> 00:05:20,400
I'm going to
die homeless
and penniless.

80
00:05:20,433 --> 00:05:22,400
I'm still 25 pounds
overweight.

81
00:05:22,433 --> 00:05:24,400
No one
will ever love me.

82
00:05:24,433 --> 00:05:26,300
I could--
I could kill myself.

83
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:30,233
Stuart, that is
just stinkin' thinkin'.

84
00:05:30,267 --> 00:05:32,900
You've got to stop
beating yourself up
over this.

85
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:34,400
I know.

86
00:05:34,433 --> 00:05:35,833
[Man]
Ahem.

87
00:05:35,867 --> 00:05:38,133
Psst!

88
00:05:38,167 --> 00:05:39,867
Got to go.

89
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,933
Ahem.

90
00:05:44,933 --> 00:05:48,000
Have you had enough time
to look at the menu?

91
00:05:48,033 --> 00:05:52,133
We've had enough time
to memoriz the menu.

92
00:05:52,167 --> 00:05:54,400
I'm sorry.
I'm having a personal crisis.

93
00:05:54,433 --> 00:05:56,433
Can I take your order?

94
00:05:56,467 --> 00:05:59,400
For my wife,
the penne arabiata,

95
00:05:59,433 --> 00:06:03,467
and, uh, I will try
the ossobuco.

96
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,567
You know, the ossobuco
is extremely fatty.

97
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,700
You might want to try--

98
00:06:09,733 --> 00:06:11,967
I'll try
the ossobuco...

99
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,667
And also the mixed
baby field Greens.

100
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,933
Low-Cal vinaigrette?

101
00:06:16,967 --> 00:06:18,167
Creamy Caesar.

102
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,167
On the side?

103
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,800
On the salad!

104
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:23,000
Thank you.

105
00:06:23,033 --> 00:06:25,167
And I'd like another
double scotch.

106
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,800
No.

107
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,400
What?

108
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,467
What am I
going to do?

109
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,900
Oh, poor baby.

110
00:06:35,933 --> 00:06:38,767
Why don't you make
an amends to her?

111
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,033
Tell her how upset
you were about
the schedule changes

112
00:06:42,067 --> 00:06:43,567
and how genuinely
sorry you are.

113
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,033
She's got to accept that.

114
00:06:45,067 --> 00:06:47,567
No, Julia,
you don't know roz.

115
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,633
She's like a cootie
or something.
I--i can't.

116
00:06:50,667 --> 00:06:52,467
Talk to her.

117
00:07:08,433 --> 00:07:09,900
Hi, Laurie.

118
00:07:09,933 --> 00:07:12,067
I have
a 9:30 appointment

119
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,033
to make an amends
to roz.

120
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:15,800
Oh, yeah.

121
00:07:17,433 --> 00:07:19,133
Ahem.

122
00:07:20,433 --> 00:07:22,400
Stuart smalley
for his 9:30.

123
00:07:22,433 --> 00:07:25,633
[Roz]
Tell him i'm
in a meeting.

124
00:07:27,433 --> 00:07:29,067
She's in a meeting.

125
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,767
I'll just have
a seat. I'll sit.

126
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,900
Yes, yes.

127
00:07:33,933 --> 00:07:36,300
So I'll be seated.

128
00:07:56,433 --> 00:07:58,100
I loved your show.

129
00:07:58,133 --> 00:08:00,467
Really?

130
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,800
I find it very comforting.

131
00:08:08,433 --> 00:08:10,400
It's o.K.
It's o.K., Laurie.

132
00:08:10,433 --> 00:08:11,933
Mm-hmm.

133
00:08:11,967 --> 00:08:14,467
Let it hurt.
Feel the pain.

134
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,933
I don't know
what to do.

135
00:08:17,967 --> 00:08:19,900
Well, there is
a support group

136
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:22,400
for people who live
with compulsive
gamblers,

137
00:08:22,433 --> 00:08:25,667
and I think
they could help
a lot more than me,

138
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:29,600
and that would be
taking an action.

139
00:08:29,633 --> 00:08:32,400
In fact, that's
what I'm doing
right now--

140
00:08:32,433 --> 00:08:33,900
taking an action.

141
00:08:33,933 --> 00:08:36,900
I want my show back,
so I'm making
an amends,

142
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,800
and maybe roz
will forgive me.

143
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:42,600
She despises you.

144
00:08:42,633 --> 00:08:45,400
Laurie, order me a--

145
00:08:45,433 --> 00:08:49,567
roz...
I know you don't
want to talk to me.

146
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,300
Actually, I've been
looking forward
to this all day.

147
00:08:55,933 --> 00:08:57,733
Cheeseburger.

148
00:09:07,433 --> 00:09:10,400
First of all,
I have a confession.

149
00:09:10,433 --> 00:09:13,400
When I walked
into this building

150
00:09:13,433 --> 00:09:15,900
2 1/2 hours ago,

151
00:09:15,933 --> 00:09:19,400
I was going to make
an amends

152
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,467
for calling you

153
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,900
a grandiose,
shame-based
overeater,

154
00:09:23,933 --> 00:09:25,900
but it wasn't
really an amends.

155
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:27,967
It was just a ploy
to get my show back.

156
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,700
Could we cut to the chase?

157
00:09:31,933 --> 00:09:35,067
I guess what i'm
trying to say

158
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,300
is I had
no right to blow up
and call you names

159
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:40,900
because when we
attack people,
it's--

160
00:09:40,933 --> 00:09:43,400
we're really
acting out
our own shame.

161
00:09:43,433 --> 00:09:44,900
What's really
important here

162
00:09:44,933 --> 00:09:47,733
is not
whether or not
I get my show back.

163
00:09:47,767 --> 00:09:50,900
What matters is,
is that I begin
to heal

164
00:09:50,933 --> 00:09:52,900
my own self-
inflicted wound

165
00:09:52,933 --> 00:09:54,900
by expressing
personally to you

166
00:09:54,933 --> 00:09:57,733
just how truly sorry
I am for what I did.

167
00:09:57,767 --> 00:09:59,800
Stuart...

168
00:10:02,433 --> 00:10:04,400
I guess I just
never realized

169
00:10:04,433 --> 00:10:07,233
how deeply you feel
about this stuff,

170
00:10:07,267 --> 00:10:09,633
and I'm glad
you came today

171
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:13,900
because otherwise,
I might not have had
the chance

172
00:10:13,933 --> 00:10:16,567
to give you
these letters.

173
00:10:19,433 --> 00:10:21,900
"Dear sir,
I have never written

174
00:10:21,933 --> 00:10:23,900
"to a television
station before,

175
00:10:23,933 --> 00:10:27,400
"but when I saw that you
canceled Stuart smalley,

176
00:10:27,433 --> 00:10:30,133
I just had to say..."

177
00:10:31,267 --> 00:10:34,233
"Thank you
to whoever took

178
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:38,133
that simpering nutcase

179
00:10:42,233 --> 00:10:44,900

Oh, here's a good one

189
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,100
Ha ha ha!

190
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,900
Aah!

191
00:11:21,933 --> 00:11:23,900
You are a horrible,

192
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,467
nasty, dysfunctional...

193
00:11:28,433 --> 00:11:30,133
Weenie.

194
00:11:50,733 --> 00:11:52,200
Julia, right? Hi.

195
00:11:52,233 --> 00:11:53,233
Hi.

196
00:11:53,267 --> 00:11:54,733
Carl, Stuart's
o.A. Sponsor,

197
00:11:54,767 --> 00:11:57,067
this is Julia,
Stuart's alanon
sponsor.

198
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,200
Hi.

199
00:11:58,233 --> 00:12:00,233
I'm Fred, Stuart's
debtors anonymous sponsor.

200
00:12:00,267 --> 00:12:01,867
And this is...

201
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,167
Jerry.

Jerry, Stuart's
adult children of
alcoholics sponsor.

203
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:06,767
How you doing?

204
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,400
Well, should we?

205
00:12:08,433 --> 00:12:09,900
Let's go.

206
00:12:09,933 --> 00:12:11,633
Oh, thank you.

207
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,633
[Knocking on door]

208
00:12:19,433 --> 00:12:21,400
Stuart, it's Carl.

209
00:12:21,433 --> 00:12:25,400
Look, I know you lost your show,
and I'm sorry,

210
00:12:25,433 --> 00:12:29,400
but shutting everybody out
is a form of isolating.

211
00:12:29,433 --> 00:12:31,533
You've done this before.

212
00:12:31,567 --> 00:12:33,300
[Stuart]
Go away!

213
00:12:34,433 --> 00:12:35,900
Stuart,
it's Jerry.

214
00:12:35,933 --> 00:12:37,900
You're in a shame
spiral, buddy.

215
00:12:37,933 --> 00:12:39,867
Tell me something
I don't know.

216
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,900
[Fred]
Stuart, you're turning
the anger inward,

217
00:12:42,933 --> 00:12:44,900
and that's why
you're depressed.

218
00:12:44,933 --> 00:12:47,967
You're angry at yourself
for losing the show.

219
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,233
Go away.

220
00:12:49,267 --> 00:12:51,433
Stuart, open
the goddamn door!

221
00:12:53,933 --> 00:12:57,533
I didn't mean that.
I owe you an amends.

222
00:12:57,567 --> 00:12:59,567
We're just here
to tell you

223
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,433
you're a terrific,
wonderful person,
and we love you.

224
00:13:02,467 --> 00:13:04,467
I'm sorry.

225
00:13:05,933 --> 00:13:08,900
I'm just not ready
to see anybody.

226
00:13:08,933 --> 00:13:10,400
Just come back later.

227
00:13:10,433 --> 00:13:12,133
Maybe...

228
00:13:13,433 --> 00:13:16,733
Maybe when I run out
of fig Newtons.

229
00:13:16,767 --> 00:13:18,733
[Telephone rings]

230
00:13:18,767 --> 00:13:20,200
[Machine beeps]

231
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:23,200
Stuart, it's Jodie.
You have to come home.

232
00:13:23,233 --> 00:13:25,400
Aunt Paula died.

233
00:13:25,433 --> 00:13:27,133
[Crying]

234
00:13:31,867 --> 00:13:33,267
[Stuart]
Dear journal,

235
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,333
as I am sucked
inexorably toward home,

236
00:13:36,367 --> 00:13:38,633
I am filled with dread,

237
00:13:38,667 --> 00:13:42,767
but perhaps I can use this trip
to come to grips

238
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,767
with some of
my family-of-origin issues.

239
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,833
Trace it, face it,
and erase it,

240
00:13:48,867 --> 00:13:51,267
as we say in alanon.

241
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,333
My father
is an active alcoholic--

242
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:56,767
big, stinking drunk--

243
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,767
and so was
his father William.

244
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,833
William had two brothers
and one sister,

245
00:14:02,867 --> 00:14:04,967
my aunt Paula.

246
00:14:06,367 --> 00:14:08,500
Boy, you're
in a giddy mood
today.

247
00:14:08,533 --> 00:14:10,900
Why not?
I'm blessed with
a three-day weekend

248
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,400
after a tough
week's work.

249
00:14:12,433 --> 00:14:14,400
I want to do
something wild
and abandoned.

250
00:14:14,433 --> 00:14:15,833
[Audience laughing]

251
00:14:15,867 --> 00:14:17,267
I loved aunt Paula.

252
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,267
She was an old maid,
so she helped take care

253
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,833
of my brother Donnie,
my sister Jodie, and me.

254
00:14:22,867 --> 00:14:24,767
I'd lay across her lap,

255
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,333
and she'd tickle my back
while we watched TV,

256
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,333
and I'd get goose bumps

257
00:14:29,367 --> 00:14:31,300
and laugh
at the dick Van dyke show.

258
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:35,267
Anyway, aunt Paula lived
a long, full life.

259
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:39,267
In fact, she outlived
all her brothers by 30 years,

260
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,967
basically because
she didn't drink.

261
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,100
There's lots of ways
to die from alcoholism--

262
00:14:45,133 --> 00:14:47,767
liver disease,
car accidents, sure--

263
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,333
but smalley men
fall off the roof.

264
00:14:51,367 --> 00:14:52,667
Whoa!

265
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,033
[Crash]

266
00:14:54,067 --> 00:14:57,600
In fact, three smalley men
have met their maker

267
00:14:57,633 --> 00:15:00,333
while changing
the storm window.

268
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:02,267
Actually, that's not true.

269
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,767
Uncle frank
got smashed one afternoon

270
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,267
and went up on the roof
to trim the big elm.

271
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:14,333
The doctor said he was dead
well before he hit the ground.

272
00:15:14,367 --> 00:15:16,267
So death is something

273
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:19,333
we smalleys
can pretty much deal with.

274
00:15:19,367 --> 00:15:21,833
It's life that seems to be

275
00:15:21,867 --> 00:15:23,333
the problem.

276
00:15:23,367 --> 00:15:25,533
Take, for example,

277
00:15:25,567 --> 00:15:27,800
my pot-smoking,
unemployed brother Donnie.

278
00:15:29,433 --> 00:15:32,400
I thought Jodie
was picking me up.

279
00:15:32,433 --> 00:15:34,400
Tommy slashed
her tires again.

280
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,900
But she got
a restraining order.

281
00:15:36,933 --> 00:15:38,900
Yeah.

282
00:15:38,933 --> 00:15:40,900
Well, not to be
judgmental,

283
00:15:40,933 --> 00:15:43,900
but he is the worst
ex-husband yet.

284
00:15:43,933 --> 00:15:46,400
How's dad?
What's he up to?

285
00:15:46,433 --> 00:15:48,400
About a quart a day.

286
00:15:48,433 --> 00:15:50,900
Mom's the one
that's driving me crazy.

287
00:15:50,933 --> 00:15:53,400
Believe me,
the minute I find work,

288
00:15:53,433 --> 00:15:54,900
I am history!

289
00:15:54,933 --> 00:15:58,400
Well, this trip,
I promised myself
to simply detach.

290
00:15:58,433 --> 00:16:01,400
Now, this trip
is about aunt Paula

291
00:16:01,433 --> 00:16:03,900
and honoring her
and remembering her,

292
00:16:03,933 --> 00:16:06,900
and I simply
refuse to get enmeshed
in the family craziness.

293
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:10,300
I'm going to
let go and let god
and just stay serene.

they say you can't
go home again.

302

In my case, make that
you're crazy to go home again.

303
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,767
Seeing my mother is always like
a trip to the dentist

304

before the advent
of modern painkillers.

305
00:16:46,933 --> 00:16:47,900
Hi, mom.

306
00:16:47,933 --> 00:16:49,900
Hi. Oh,
be careful,
honey.

You don't
want to get
splattered.

Well, you've
been busy--

00:16:53,933 --> 00:16:55,400
lots of food.

310
00:16:55,433 --> 00:16:56,900
Well, as a rule,

311
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:59,400
it's better
to have too much
than too little,

312
00:16:59,433 --> 00:17:01,900
or maybe I just
don't know

313

how to cook
for a funeral.

314
00:17:03,933 --> 00:17:05,900
I didn't mean to be
critical, mom.

315
00:17:05,933 --> 00:17:07,400
It's just that,
you know,

316
00:17:07,433 --> 00:17:09,400
we're going to have,
like, 20 people.

317

Aunt Paula died,
not, you know,
the queen of england.

318
00:17:12,433 --> 00:17:15,400
Now, what is that comment
supposed to mean?

319
00:17:15,433 --> 00:17:17,400
I'm sorry.
I didn't--

it's a beautiful

321
00:17:19,933 --> 00:17:22,400
and I owe you
an amends.

322

Amends?

323
00:17:23,933 --> 00:17:26,900
Is that one of
those funny words

that you use
in your little
TV show?

Well, um, actually,
I'm not going to be
doing that anymore.

that would happen,
didn't I?

that helped
to prepare you

for the disappointment.

everything that
happens to me--

you know,
how I feel about things.

337
00:18:04,933 --> 00:18:07,667
It's going to be
pretty much the story
of my life.

338
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:11,733
I got a good title for it--
waste of space.

00:18:19,133 --> 00:18:21,667
That's what dad
always called me

344
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,933
when I was growing up.

345
00:18:23,967 --> 00:18:27,000
Hey, dad,
what do you say
you and me tomorrow,

346
00:18:27,033 --> 00:18:28,567
we get
really loaded,

347
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,733
we go up
on the roof,

348
00:18:30,767 --> 00:18:32,367
change
the storm windows?

349
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,400
Nobody's changing
any windows tomorrow.

350
00:18:35,433 --> 00:18:37,633
We got a funeral.

351
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,833
Seeing aunt Paula
in that coffin

352
00:18:44,867 --> 00:18:46,767
hit me pretty hard,

353
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:51,900
but my sister Jodie
went right into a lumbar spasm.

354
00:18:51,933 --> 00:18:56,400
You know, aunt Paula
was the best person
in this entire family,

355
00:18:56,433 --> 00:18:58,600
and nobody gives a damn.

356
00:18:58,633 --> 00:19:00,900
I mean, dad hated her,

357
00:19:00,933 --> 00:19:04,400
Donnie just thinks
this is one big joke,

358
00:19:04,433 --> 00:19:08,967
and, well,
all mom cares about
is her stupid glazed ham.

359
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:12,400
You know,
Jodie, I think
all this stress

360
00:19:12,433 --> 00:19:14,300
is going
right to your back--

361
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:18,100
I mean,
raising a son
all on your own,

362
00:19:18,133 --> 00:19:20,900
Tommy slashing
your tires,

363
00:19:20,933 --> 00:19:24,633
you know,
and your weight--

364
00:19:24,667 --> 00:19:26,400
more of the stress--

365
00:19:26,433 --> 00:19:28,500
so I was thinking,
well--

366
00:19:28,533 --> 00:19:31,567
Stuart, I am not going

367
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,600
to an overeaters
anonymous meeting.

368
00:19:34,633 --> 00:19:37,833
O.k., forget
I said it.

369
00:19:42,433 --> 00:19:43,900
Madelyn Doyle--

370
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:46,933
I served in the wacs
with Paula.

371
00:19:46,967 --> 00:19:48,400
Hello.

372
00:19:48,433 --> 00:19:50,400
Are you Stuart?

373
00:19:50,433 --> 00:19:52,333
Yes, I am.

374
00:19:52,367 --> 00:19:53,900
Oh, I remember you

375
00:19:53,933 --> 00:19:56,400
when you were
this high...

376
00:19:57,633 --> 00:20:00,200
And this wide.

377
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:04,300
Thanks for--
for coming.

378
00:20:07,933 --> 00:20:09,900
See you
at the reception.

379
00:20:09,933 --> 00:20:11,633
Uh, no.

380
00:20:12,933 --> 00:20:14,400
Bye-bye.

381
00:20:14,433 --> 00:20:16,133
[Grunts]

382
00:20:18,933 --> 00:20:21,833
[Dad]
What the hell
are they doing here?

383
00:20:21,867 --> 00:20:23,400
Oh, they've got
some nerve.

384
00:20:23,433 --> 00:20:25,400
They're not coming
to the reception.

385
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:28,200
I'm going to
throw them out of
my goddamn house.

386
00:20:28,233 --> 00:20:29,833
Dad's hated cousin ray

387
00:20:29,867 --> 00:20:31,333
ever since ray

388
00:20:31,367 --> 00:20:33,100
accidentally poisoned our dog.

389
00:20:33,133 --> 00:20:36,233
Read about aunt Paula
in the paper.

390
00:20:36,267 --> 00:20:38,733
Denise and I
couldn't be sorrier,

391
00:20:38,767 --> 00:20:42,233
and I mean that
in the sincerest
way possible.

392
00:20:42,267 --> 00:20:44,433
Up yours.

393
00:20:45,933 --> 00:20:48,900
I understand.
It's a difficult time.

394
00:20:48,933 --> 00:20:50,900
Just one question--

395
00:20:50,933 --> 00:20:55,500
where do you
plan to Bury
the old soul?

396
00:20:59,767 --> 00:21:02,467
I'm so sad about aunt Paula.

397
00:21:03,933 --> 00:21:05,733
Why?

398
00:21:05,767 --> 00:21:07,933
Because she died.

399
00:21:09,433 --> 00:21:12,700
Yes, yes,
it's a bummer.

400
00:21:13,933 --> 00:21:16,900
What do you suppose
cousin ray meant

401
00:21:16,933 --> 00:21:20,900
when he asked
where we plan
to Bury aunt Paula?

402
00:21:20,933 --> 00:21:23,900
What do you think
that was all about?

403
00:21:23,933 --> 00:21:27,400
Oh...oh,
he's a jerk.

404
00:21:27,433 --> 00:21:31,400
This is classic
smalley family
bullshit.

405
00:21:31,433 --> 00:21:34,400
Ray wants to Bury
his mother-in-law

406
00:21:34,433 --> 00:21:37,400
in the family plot
next to uncle frank.

407
00:21:37,433 --> 00:21:41,100
Denise's mother?
Why can't they
Bury her there?

408
00:21:42,933 --> 00:21:44,400
Because she's not dead.

409
00:21:44,433 --> 00:21:47,400
After she dies,
why can't they Bury

410
00:21:47,433 --> 00:21:50,400
both aunt Paula
and Denise's mother there?

411
00:21:50,433 --> 00:21:54,900
I thought there were
two graves left
in the family plot,

412
00:21:54,933 --> 00:21:58,400
you know, unless somebody
snuck somebody in there

413
00:21:58,433 --> 00:22:00,767
when we weren't looking.

414
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,400
Look, all I know
is if ray-ray wants trouble,

415
00:22:03,433 --> 00:22:05,633
me and dad
will give it to him.

416
00:22:05,667 --> 00:22:08,467
Donnie, it's a funeral.

417
00:22:09,933 --> 00:22:12,400
Mind if I move your bong?

418
00:22:12,433 --> 00:22:13,400
No.

419
00:22:13,433 --> 00:22:15,733
You know, just be
careful with it.

420
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:18,767
Donnie was getting
more like dad every day,

421
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,333
and now that he was
living at home again,

422
00:22:22,367 --> 00:22:23,767
he's getting even worse.

423
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:27,767
Dad was not what you'd call
a great role model,

424
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,767
but as I thought back
on our childhood,

425
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,700
I remembered
he wasn't always so bad.

426
00:22:33,733 --> 00:22:35,267
Set, hike!

427
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,833
Hey, Donnie,
I'm open!

428
00:22:36,867 --> 00:22:38,533
Over here!

429
00:22:38,567 --> 00:22:39,767
Pass!

430
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,167
Donnie! Come on,
Donnie! Throw it!

431
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,700
Come on!
Pass it!
I'm open!

432
00:22:44,733 --> 00:22:47,500
Come on!
Throw it!
Come on!

433
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:49,333
I got it!

434
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:51,200
Oops.

435
00:22:51,233 --> 00:22:53,167
Oh, great.

436
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,267
When we first moved
into our house,

437
00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:00,400
we lived next-door to this guy
who all the kids just hated.

438
00:23:00,433 --> 00:23:02,833
We called him mean Mr. Dimmit.

439
00:23:02,867 --> 00:23:04,567
I told you kids

440
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,667
to keep the ball
out of my yard!

441
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,100
Hey! Hey! Hey!

442
00:23:11,367 --> 00:23:13,133
Heh heh heh!

443
00:23:19,367 --> 00:23:21,900
Oh, my god, it's dad.
Get down.

444
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:25,367
Dad, mean Mr. Dimmit
just stole our ball.

445
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,500
Yeah, he just
took it.

446
00:23:27,533 --> 00:23:29,200
Hi, dad.

447
00:23:32,367 --> 00:23:33,833
Let's go.

448
00:23:33,867 --> 00:23:35,267
Come on.

449
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,767
Dad charged off
to find Mr. Dimmit

450
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,133
and get our football back.

451
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:54,733
Maybe you'd like to pick on
someone with pubic hair.

452
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:56,233
Huh?

453
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,767
You going to give me
the ball,

454
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,967
or would you like me
to shove it up your ass?

455
00:24:06,967 --> 00:24:09,567
You want to hear
my preference?

456
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:31,133
Nuts.

457
00:24:33,867 --> 00:24:35,967
O.k., let's go home.

458
00:24:41,967 --> 00:24:43,433
[Stuart]
It was great.

459
00:24:43,467 --> 00:24:45,467
And dad said,
"why don't you

460
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,333
pick on somebody
with puberty?"

461
00:24:47,367 --> 00:24:48,767
Didn't you, dad?

462
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,100
That night, all of US
just glowed with pride

463
00:24:51,133 --> 00:24:53,267
as Donnie and I recounted

464
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,267
the victorious
confrontation for mom

465
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,833
while dad
held on to that football

466
00:24:57,867 --> 00:24:59,767
in his big, strong hands.

467
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:03,067
Dad was our hero--
at least that night.

468
00:25:15,867 --> 00:25:17,767
Aunt Paula's last request

469
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,333
was for a peaceful,
serene funeral--

470
00:25:20,367 --> 00:25:22,267
lots of luck in this family.

471
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,767
Sure enough,
when we got to the cemetery,

472
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,167
there was cousin ray
with two policemen

473
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,867
and a court order saying
we couldn't Bury aunt Paula.

474
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,433
What the hell?

475
00:25:32,467 --> 00:25:35,967
Dad was pissed.

476
00:25:38,433 --> 00:25:42,067
Mr. Smalley, I'm so sorry
I missed you at the--

477
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,433
you son
of a bitch!

478
00:25:44,467 --> 00:25:46,400
Mr. Lawson does have
a legal contract

479
00:25:46,433 --> 00:25:47,933
guaranteeing
his mother-in-law

480
00:25:47,967 --> 00:25:49,400
a place in the smalley
family plot.

481
00:25:49,433 --> 00:25:51,400
All but one of the graves
is currently occupied.

482
00:25:51,433 --> 00:25:53,400
There's supposed to be
two of them!

483
00:25:53,433 --> 00:25:55,633
Who the hell did you put
in the other grave?

484
00:25:55,667 --> 00:25:58,467
Well, that's for me to know
and you to find out.

485
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,733
Ah! Ah! That's it!

486
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:04,567
You know, my aunt Paula
paid for that plot!

487
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,067
With money
she could have used
to help my family

488
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,100
after my father
fell off the roof!

489
00:26:09,133 --> 00:26:12,367
I made a ham
for your father.

490
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,400
That was not
a quality ham!

491
00:26:14,433 --> 00:26:16,400
Unless you can
produce some sort
of document,

492
00:26:16,433 --> 00:26:17,900
I don't know
what else I can--

493
00:26:17,933 --> 00:26:19,900
we're really
not very good
at organizing,

494
00:26:19,933 --> 00:26:21,900
you know, papers,
insurance forms,

495
00:26:21,933 --> 00:26:23,900
warranties--
that sort of thing.

496
00:26:23,933 --> 00:26:25,900
I told dad
to get a drawer.

497
00:26:25,933 --> 00:26:27,233
Uh-huh.

498
00:26:27,267 --> 00:26:29,900
You see, officer,
this is really
about alcoholism,

499
00:26:29,933 --> 00:26:32,067
which is really
a family disease.

500
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,567
What are we doing?

501
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,133
Come on.

502
00:26:37,933 --> 00:26:38,900
Ha!

503
00:26:38,933 --> 00:26:40,900
Pull her out.

504
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:43,300
Please, show
some respect.

505
00:26:43,333 --> 00:26:45,133
Ow!

506
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,433
I'm a taxpayer,
damn it!

507
00:26:53,367 --> 00:26:55,267
That was the first time

508
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:59,367
dad had actually slugged a cop
on purpose.

509
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,900
Cancel
the reception.

510
00:27:00,933 --> 00:27:02,400
Are you insane?

511
00:27:02,433 --> 00:27:05,200
I made
all that food.

512
00:27:05,233 --> 00:27:08,233
My aunt Paula
is not in the ground!

513
00:27:08,267 --> 00:27:10,033
We are not canceling
the reception.

514
00:27:10,067 --> 00:27:12,400
Jodie, Stuart,
you heard dad.

515
00:27:12,433 --> 00:27:14,533
Cancel the reception!

516
00:27:14,567 --> 00:27:16,467
[Engine starts]

517
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,533
Goddamn it,
do as I told you!

518
00:27:19,567 --> 00:27:22,400
[Organ playing]

519
00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:25,267
[Priest]
Our father,
who art in heaven...

520
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:28,333
The next day,
we laid aunt Paula to rest

521
00:27:28,367 --> 00:27:29,767
in the catholic cemetery,

522
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,833
even though
she was a presbyterian,

523
00:27:31,867 --> 00:27:33,767
but I don't think that meant

524
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,267
she was any farther
from her higher power.

525
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,767
Dad just glared at mom
throughout the whole thing

526
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,333
because she had disobeyed him
and had the reception.

527
00:27:41,367 --> 00:27:43,267
Donnie was in a real bad mood

528
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,267
because he hadn't smoked
any pot

529
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:48,267
and had just spent an entire
night in a cell with dad,

530
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,267
who hadn't had
anything to drink.

531
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,767
Jodie felt really sick
because she had scarfed

532
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,267
the entire 7-pound glazed ham
at the reception,

533
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,767
and I was upset
because now the whole thing

534
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,767
wasn't about
aunt Paula anymore.

535
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,267
It was about dad
and his drinking

536
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,333
and the whole
family craziness.

537
00:28:04,367 --> 00:28:06,267
Then Jodie took my hand,

538
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,833
and I felt this chill
run up my spine,

539
00:28:08,867 --> 00:28:10,767
as if she was saying

540
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,767
it was up to me
to save my entire family.

541
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:17,767
It made me want to jump
into the grave with aunt Paula

542
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,767
and let her
tickle my back forever.

543
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,433
As soon as I got back
to Chicago,

544
00:28:23,467 --> 00:28:27,767
I put on my pajamas
and went to bed for six days.

545
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,267
Between losing aunt Paula
and losing my show,

546
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,900
it dawned on me
that my life really sucked.

547
00:28:32,933 --> 00:28:35,267
[Knock on door]

548
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:38,100
Stuart, it's Laurie.

549
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:40,667
Laurie?

550
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,800
I have something
for you.

551
00:28:48,933 --> 00:28:50,967
I quit my job, Stuart.

552
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,300
I told roz I wouldn't work
for an abusive boss anymore.

553
00:28:55,333 --> 00:29:00,900
"Dear Stuart, your show
gave me the courage
to feel my feelings

554
00:29:00,933 --> 00:29:04,400

00:29:04,433 --> 00:29:08,900

Amanda q."

558
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,167
The people at
the support group

559
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,800
told me I wasn't
responsible

560
00:29:17,833 --> 00:29:19,300
for my boyfriend's
debts.

561
00:29:19,333 --> 00:29:21,300
You saved my life!

562
00:29:25,733 --> 00:29:28,067
Maybe that's
a little strong.

563
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:31,000
Thanks for coming,
you guys.

564
00:29:31,033 --> 00:29:32,500
Come on in.

565
00:29:32,533 --> 00:29:34,400
I've got plenty
of cookies.

566
00:29:34,433 --> 00:29:35,900
Great. Yes.

567
00:29:35,933 --> 00:29:37,400
How do I look?

568
00:29:37,433 --> 00:29:38,900
Horrible.

569
00:29:38,933 --> 00:29:40,400
Yeah. I know.

570
00:29:40,433 --> 00:29:41,867
Believe me.

571
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,533
I don't smell
so great, either.

572
00:29:43,567 --> 00:29:45,233
Laurie brought
maybe 100 letters

573
00:29:45,267 --> 00:29:47,333
from people who loved my show--

574
00:29:47,367 --> 00:29:49,833
co-dependents, overeaters,
rageaholics--

575
00:29:49,867 --> 00:29:51,467
you know, my people.

576
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,567
It made me realize
that I do have a gift,

577
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,167
however tenuous.

578
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,333
I shouldn't say that.
I have a gift. I have a gift.

579
00:29:58,367 --> 00:30:01,633
Anyway, Julia reminded me that
I won't have anything to give

580
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:03,700
if I don't take care of me.

581
00:30:03,733 --> 00:30:08,467

00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,367
* you'll be great

* honey, everything's

587
00:30:25,667 --> 00:30:28,367
every morning, like clockwork,
a one-mile walk/jog,

588
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,367
because, you know, you don't
want to kill yourself.

* honey, everything's

593
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,833
and of course, my meetings,

594
00:30:42,867 --> 00:30:45,333
mainly overeaters anonymous
and alanon,

595
00:30:45,367 --> 00:30:46,867
but debtors anonymous, too,

596
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,400
because I have
a lot of money issues--

597
00:30:48,433 --> 00:30:51,000
for example,
having very little.

598
00:30:52,367 --> 00:30:56,033
And every day I remind myself
just how far I've come

599
00:30:56,067 --> 00:30:59,433
and how grateful I am
to be in recovery.

600
00:30:59,467 --> 00:31:01,433
That attitude of gratitude,

601
00:31:01,467 --> 00:31:04,167
it ain't just a platitude.

602
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,667
So for now, I'm happy to have
my life on an even keel,

603
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,867
because I am an adult,

604
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:13,467
and I refuse to live
from crisis to crisis.

605
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,800
[Telephone rings]

606
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,300
Hello?

607
00:31:18,333 --> 00:31:19,767
Stuart? It's Jodie.

608
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,267
Donnie's suing me.

609
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,167
Well, why is Donnie
suing you, Jodie?

610
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,533
Jodie was halfway
through a Sara Lee,

611
00:31:26,567 --> 00:31:27,967
going absolutely nuts

612
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,500
because the whole family
was ready to kill each other

613
00:31:30,533 --> 00:31:33,000
over aunt Paula's will,
and now she wanted me

614
00:31:33,033 --> 00:31:35,267
to come home
and fix everything.

615
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,767
So basically,

616
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,867
aunt Paula left
my family her house,

617
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,833
which is worth
about $60,000.

618
00:31:40,867 --> 00:31:43,333
That makes my share
about 12,000,

619
00:31:43,367 --> 00:31:45,333
which, as you know,
I need desperately.

620
00:31:45,367 --> 00:31:47,733
So, what's
the problem?

621
00:31:47,767 --> 00:31:49,833
Or the gazpacho.

622
00:31:49,867 --> 00:31:52,200
I could recommend
the gazpa...Cho.

623
00:31:52,233 --> 00:31:54,167
The problem is

624
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,167
aunt Paula made Jodie
the executor

625
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,067
of her estate,

626
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,367
and now Jodie says
we can't sell the house

627
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,367
because of some problem
with the neighbor.

628
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,900
What kind
of problem?

629
00:32:03,933 --> 00:32:05,500
I don't know.

630
00:32:05,533 --> 00:32:07,133
Jodie was
kind of vague.

631
00:32:07,167 --> 00:32:09,400
She's not really...
What's the word...

632
00:32:09,433 --> 00:32:10,900
Smart...

633
00:32:10,933 --> 00:32:12,533
I guess you could say.

634
00:32:12,567 --> 00:32:14,167
And now Donnie's
all upset,

635
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,667
and he's threatening
to sue her,

636
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,167
and Jodie wants me
to come home,

637
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,700
which I really feel
that I should.

638
00:32:18,733 --> 00:32:20,200
But then I think

639
00:32:20,233 --> 00:32:22,000
I should just
stay out of it,

640
00:32:22,033 --> 00:32:23,867
and even though
I really need the money,

641
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,400
I should give Jodie
my share.

642
00:32:25,433 --> 00:32:27,200
I'm "shoulding"
all over myself.

643
00:32:27,233 --> 00:32:29,500
Stuart, we all
want to go home

644
00:32:29,533 --> 00:32:31,000
and save
our families,

645
00:32:31,033 --> 00:32:32,500
but we can't.

646
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:34,000
We're not
that powerful.

647
00:32:34,033 --> 00:32:35,500
And trying to
just makes US

648
00:32:35,533 --> 00:32:37,167
feel even more
powerless

649
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,667
and more
screwed up.

650
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,167
I know.

651
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,767
I have been through
this whole thing
myself.

652
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,800
You want my advice?
Don't go.

653
00:32:44,833 --> 00:32:48,233
You're right.
I shouldn't.

654
00:32:50,967 --> 00:32:53,267
The smalleys were never
very good with money.

655
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,500
My father grew up
in the great depression--

656
00:32:55,533 --> 00:32:57,633
his mother's.

657
00:32:57,667 --> 00:33:00,867
And there never was much
when we were kids.

658
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,300
And for some reason,

659
00:33:02,333 --> 00:33:06,967
I was always looking for a way
to bail the family out.

660
00:33:08,133 --> 00:33:12,367
* may the lord
always watch *

661
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:16,067

Wow, a car
full of cash.

00:33:20,733 --> 00:33:22,267
Whose is it?

666
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,767
It's first prize
in the ajax
sweepstakes.

667
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,200
How do you enter?

668
00:33:26,233 --> 00:33:27,933
Easy. Help name

669
00:33:27,967 --> 00:33:29,500
the ajax
white knight.

1,000 prizes.

No samples, ma'am.

678
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,400
You want to win,
get an entry blank.

679
00:33:45,433 --> 00:33:49,300
In case of tie,
winner will be determined

680
00:33:49,333 --> 00:33:51,733
by earliest postmark.

681
00:33:51,767 --> 00:33:54,200
I was convinced
I had the perfect name

682
00:33:54,233 --> 00:33:56,467
and got to the post office
at exactly 9 A.M.

683
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,400
The next morning.

684
00:33:58,433 --> 00:34:02,200
You've already
sent it in?

685
00:34:02,233 --> 00:34:03,900
Mm-hmm.

686
00:34:03,933 --> 00:34:06,133
Well, I just
don't want you

687
00:34:06,167 --> 00:34:08,200
to be horribly
crushed

688
00:34:08,233 --> 00:34:09,733
when you don't win.

689
00:34:09,767 --> 00:34:11,400
What was your name
again?

690
00:34:11,433 --> 00:34:13,100
Sir cleanalot.

691
00:34:13,133 --> 00:34:15,133
Hmm...

692
00:34:15,167 --> 00:34:16,567
I don't know

693
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,033
why I can't
remember that.

694
00:34:18,067 --> 00:34:20,400
It's the ajax
white knight.

695
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:22,933
He cleans,
you know, a lot.

696
00:34:22,967 --> 00:34:24,933
Mmm...

697
00:34:24,967 --> 00:34:27,433
I don't know.

698
00:34:27,467 --> 00:34:30,100
[Laughter]

699
00:34:32,033 --> 00:34:34,433
When the big night
finally arrived,

700
00:34:34,467 --> 00:34:36,433
dad had a new nickname for me.

701
00:34:36,467 --> 00:34:38,600
Here we go.

702
00:34:38,633 --> 00:34:41,233
Is sir eatalot getting
a little nervous?

703
00:34:41,267 --> 00:34:43,067
Ha ha! Sir eatalot.

704
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:47,600
I was already nostalgic
for "waste of space."

705
00:34:47,633 --> 00:34:49,400
Now a word
from our friends

706
00:34:49,433 --> 00:34:50,800
at colgate-
palmolive.

707
00:34:50,833 --> 00:34:54,500
At about 8:57,
my heart was pounding,

708
00:34:54,533 --> 00:34:56,100
and I was trying
to block my family

709
00:34:56,133 --> 00:34:57,733
out of my consciousness
and pray

710
00:34:57,767 --> 00:34:59,900
the name was sir cleanalot.

711
00:34:59,933 --> 00:35:01,367
Six weeks ago
tonight,

712
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,867
we announced

713
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,500
the "name
the ajax white
knight contest."

714
00:35:04,533 --> 00:35:06,500
Well, two million
entries later,

715
00:35:06,533 --> 00:35:08,433
we have a winner.

716
00:35:08,467 --> 00:35:10,600
This is it--

717
00:35:10,633 --> 00:35:13,433
sir eatalot's
moment of triumph.

718
00:35:13,467 --> 00:35:14,933
The winner of

719
00:35:14,967 --> 00:35:17,167
the "name
the ajax white
knight contest"

720
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,800
and the winner
of a brand-new

721
00:35:19,833 --> 00:35:22,000
1967 Pontiac
bonneville

722
00:35:22,033 --> 00:35:25,167
filled with cash
is...

723
00:35:27,367 --> 00:35:30,800
Mrs. Carl hesby
of council bluffs,
Iowa.

724
00:35:30,833 --> 00:35:32,267
[Applause]

725
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,933
There must be
some mistake, Stuart.

726
00:35:33,967 --> 00:35:35,800
You can't be
Mrs. Carl hesby,

727
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:37,367
can you?

728
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,067
And the name
submitted by
Mrs. Hesby,

729
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:43,000
the name of the ajax
white knight,

730
00:35:43,033 --> 00:35:45,367
is sir Lancelot.

731
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,800
Sir Lancelot?

732
00:35:47,833 --> 00:35:50,100
That is
a better name.

733
00:35:50,133 --> 00:35:52,567
Ha ha ha!

734
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,033
Your family
must be very proud.

735
00:35:55,067 --> 00:35:58,200
Ha ha ha!

736
00:35:58,233 --> 00:36:00,200
Sir cleanalot!

737
00:36:00,233 --> 00:36:01,700
Ha ha ha!

738
00:36:01,733 --> 00:36:03,900
Ha ha ha!

739
00:36:03,933 --> 00:36:05,400
Jodie is a liar.

740
00:36:05,433 --> 00:36:07,233
Either that
or she's just crazy

741
00:36:07,267 --> 00:36:08,933
or both.

742
00:36:10,667 --> 00:36:13,200
I mean, the idea
of Jodie

743
00:36:13,233 --> 00:36:15,600
being in charge
of anything...

744
00:36:15,633 --> 00:36:17,133
Just because she
went shopping

745
00:36:17,167 --> 00:36:18,633
for aunt Paula
a couple
of times.

746
00:36:18,667 --> 00:36:20,100
I took care
of her car.

747
00:36:20,133 --> 00:36:22,167
Good point.

748
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,667
What's the problem

749
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,167
with aunt Paula's
neighbor?

750
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,667
Why can't we
sell her house?

751
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,200
Because the guy's
a jerk.

752
00:36:28,233 --> 00:36:29,833
Part of
aunt Paula's house

753
00:36:29,867 --> 00:36:31,433
slops onto
his property,

754
00:36:31,467 --> 00:36:33,400
so we got to pay
an easement.

755
00:36:33,433 --> 00:36:35,400
What's an easement?

756
00:36:35,433 --> 00:36:37,900
An easement is...

757
00:36:37,933 --> 00:36:41,033
Money that you
got to pay a guy

758
00:36:41,067 --> 00:36:43,900
when your house
slops onto his
property.

759
00:36:43,933 --> 00:36:45,733
Jodie went over

760
00:36:45,767 --> 00:36:47,300
to negotiate
with him,

761
00:36:47,333 --> 00:36:48,800
and like an idiot,

762
00:36:48,833 --> 00:36:50,967
she offers him
$3,000--

763
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,333
3,000 for a little
easement.

764
00:36:53,367 --> 00:36:56,700
When dad heard this,
he flipped out.

765
00:36:59,733 --> 00:37:01,733
Your shot.

766
00:37:01,767 --> 00:37:03,667
I shoot
the stripey ones?

767
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,933
Yeah,
the stripey ones.

768
00:37:05,967 --> 00:37:07,967
Anyway, I got
this lawyer

769
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,500
to handle it.

770
00:37:09,533 --> 00:37:10,967
That's not
working out,

771
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,900
and Jodie doesn't
trust me and dad
anymore.

772
00:37:12,933 --> 00:37:14,800
You got to talk
to this guy
tomorrow.

773
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:17,567
I have to?

774
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,800
You got to try
and chisel him
down a little.

775
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,467
Beer.

776
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,200
Donnie, how
are you doing?

777
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,267
That
your brother?

778
00:37:30,067 --> 00:37:31,667
Yeah.

779
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,833
Donnie's brother,
have a beer with US.

780
00:37:33,867 --> 00:37:35,333
No, thank you.

781
00:37:35,367 --> 00:37:36,967
You see,
I don't drink.

782
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,933
Have a beer
with US.

783
00:37:38,967 --> 00:37:40,967
It's really
very kind of you,

784
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,967
but I just had
a diet soda,

785
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,733
and i'm
a little gassy.

786
00:37:46,867 --> 00:37:48,500
Do you think
you're too good

787
00:37:48,533 --> 00:37:50,300
to drink a beer
with US?

788
00:37:50,333 --> 00:37:53,433
Oh, no, no.

789
00:37:53,467 --> 00:37:55,900
I've always been
too scared to drink

790
00:37:55,933 --> 00:37:59,800
because I think
my family has the gene

791
00:37:59,833 --> 00:38:02,167
for alcoholism.

792
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,400
You know, genetics?

793
00:38:04,433 --> 00:38:05,967
We know genetics.

794
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,967
What, do you think
we're stupid?

795
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,567
Hey, look,
numb nuts,

796
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,600
either you
drink a beer
with US,

797
00:38:11,633 --> 00:38:13,600
or I'm going
to drink it

798
00:38:13,633 --> 00:38:15,567
and spit it down
your throat.

799
00:38:19,267 --> 00:38:21,033
Maybe just a sip.

800
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,733
Stuart, don't drink it.

801
00:38:32,767 --> 00:38:34,233
He'd better
drink it.

802
00:38:34,267 --> 00:38:35,967
Don't drink it.

803
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,600
Look, you lay
a finger

804
00:38:37,633 --> 00:38:39,100
on my brother,

805
00:38:39,133 --> 00:38:40,567
I'll hit you
so hard

806
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,900
your relatives
will die.

807
00:38:41,933 --> 00:38:43,533
Oh, yeah?

808
00:38:43,567 --> 00:38:45,100
Oh, no.

809
00:38:45,133 --> 00:38:46,333
Yeah.

810
00:38:46,367 --> 00:38:47,633
Donnie,
please, stop.

811
00:38:47,667 --> 00:38:49,233
Wait. Wait.
No. No.

812
00:38:49,267 --> 00:38:51,633
Can I ask you
a question?

813
00:38:51,667 --> 00:38:53,267
When you were
growing up,

814
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,400
did your dad
ever hit you?

815
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:57,333
Sure.

816
00:38:57,367 --> 00:38:58,833
Of course.

817
00:38:58,867 --> 00:39:00,667
See, I thought so.

818
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,167
Because I think

819
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,800
you're acting out
the shame

820
00:39:03,833 --> 00:39:05,300
and powerlessness

821
00:39:05,333 --> 00:39:07,333
of that tiny,
frightened child

822
00:39:07,367 --> 00:39:09,867
that's still
inside of you,

823
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:13,067
and you might feel
a lot better

824
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,533
if you could say
to your inner child,

825
00:39:15,567 --> 00:39:18,167
"hello, little child.

826
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:21,467
"I'm going to
protect you,

827
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,800
and no one will
ever hurt you again."

828
00:39:26,133 --> 00:39:28,333
You want to try
saying that?

829
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,867
Give it up!

830
00:39:41,767 --> 00:39:43,200
Thanks for
standing up
for me.

831
00:39:43,233 --> 00:39:44,733
Yeah.

832
00:39:44,767 --> 00:39:46,367
No, really.
I appreciate it.

833
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,867
Yeah. Well, let's
just drop it,

834
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,300
all right?

835
00:39:49,333 --> 00:39:51,267
O.k.

836
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:54,233
[Television]
He takes it high.

837
00:39:54,267 --> 00:39:55,600
He has struck out,

838
00:39:55,633 --> 00:39:57,667
bounced into
a forced play,
and walked.

839
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:00,500
Nine walks
and a hit batter

840
00:40:00,533 --> 00:40:02,267
from the staff
today.

841
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,067
Hammers down
the left field line.

842
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,067
This will score
at least two.

843
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,700
I've heard everyone's version
of this whole dispute,

844
00:40:08,733 --> 00:40:10,967
and I am totally disgusted

845
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,533
with each and every member
of my family.

846
00:40:14,567 --> 00:40:16,033
[Stuart]
Get this.

847
00:40:16,067 --> 00:40:17,567
Donnie's lawyer isn't
charging him a thing.

848
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,567
They're old drinking buddies
from the Navy,

849
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,067
so he's doing it
as a favor.

850
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,567
Some favor.

851
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,067
He's not paying
any attention

852
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,600
because he's not
getting paid,

853
00:40:25,633 --> 00:40:27,667
so the whole thing
has just degenerated.

854
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,300
[Julia]
Stuart,

855
00:40:29,333 --> 00:40:31,267
you don't
have to do this.

856
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:33,000
You don't have
to be the hero.

857
00:40:33,033 --> 00:40:34,500
Oh, god, Julia,

858
00:40:34,533 --> 00:40:37,333
there are no boundaries
in this household.

859
00:40:37,367 --> 00:40:39,467
Every little thing you do--

860
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,700
[beep beep beep]

861
00:40:41,733 --> 00:40:43,200
Mom...

862
00:40:43,233 --> 00:40:44,733
[Beep beep beep]

863
00:40:44,767 --> 00:40:46,600
Mom...

864
00:40:46,633 --> 00:40:48,600
[Beep]

865
00:40:48,633 --> 00:40:50,100
Mom!

866
00:40:50,133 --> 00:40:51,600
Oh, oh!
I'm sorry.

867
00:40:51,633 --> 00:40:53,567
Are you
on the phone?

868
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,400
Yes.

869
00:40:55,433 --> 00:40:57,200
Well, I'm sorry.

870
00:40:57,233 --> 00:40:59,533
Who are you
talking to,
sweetheart?

871
00:40:59,567 --> 00:41:01,100
A friend.

872
00:41:01,133 --> 00:41:03,600
Oh, someone
I know?

873
00:41:03,633 --> 00:41:06,533
It's my sponsor
from alanon.

874
00:41:06,567 --> 00:41:08,833
It's a 12-step
group I joined

875
00:41:08,867 --> 00:41:11,533
because I come from
such a screwed-up
family.

876
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:15,100
All right, then.

877
00:41:15,133 --> 00:41:16,967
Have a good chat.

878
00:41:22,133 --> 00:41:24,667
Aunt Paula's house
was considered a fixer-upper.

879
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:27,433
To me, it looked more
like a blower-upper.

880
00:41:27,467 --> 00:41:28,933
But the big problem was

881
00:41:28,967 --> 00:41:30,767
somebody screwed up
a long time ago,

882
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,833
and 2 feet
of aunt Paula's house

883
00:41:32,867 --> 00:41:34,467
was on her neighbor's
property.

884
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:37,200
So there was no way
we could sell the house

885
00:41:37,233 --> 00:41:39,467
unless I could settle
this easement problem

886
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:42,267
with the neighbor.

887
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,767
Hi.

888
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,033
Um, are you
Orville egeberg?

889
00:41:47,267 --> 00:41:50,133
I'm sorry.
I'm Stuart smalley.

890
00:41:50,167 --> 00:41:51,767
I would have
called you,

891
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,433
but my sister said

892
00:41:53,467 --> 00:41:56,167
that you don't like
to talk on the phone.

893
00:41:57,733 --> 00:41:59,667
Um, as you know,

894
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:02,933
my aunt Paula
was your neighbor

895
00:42:02,967 --> 00:42:04,433
for...um...

896
00:42:04,467 --> 00:42:06,633
I guess
since world war ii.

897
00:42:06,667 --> 00:42:08,733
I guess you
weren't close.

898
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:10,833
Anyway,
when she died,

899
00:42:10,867 --> 00:42:14,400
she left the house
to my family

900
00:42:14,433 --> 00:42:16,167
and made
my sister Jodie

901
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,167
the executor
of the estate.

902
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,967
As you know,

903
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,433
we cannot get
a mortgage

904
00:42:22,467 --> 00:42:23,933
and thus split up
the inheritance

905
00:42:23,967 --> 00:42:25,433
on the house

906
00:42:25,467 --> 00:42:26,900
until we get
the easement from you,

907
00:42:26,933 --> 00:42:28,400
and of course,

908
00:42:28,433 --> 00:42:30,400
you have
sent Jodie a letter

909
00:42:30,433 --> 00:42:32,400
agreeing to Grant US
the easement

910
00:42:32,433 --> 00:42:33,900
for $3,000,

911
00:42:33,933 --> 00:42:35,567
which she agreed to
verbally...

912
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,067
Or orally, whatever.

913
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:39,067
I thought we had
an agreement.

914
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,567
Uh, yes,

915
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:44,767
but the thing is
I am the new executor,

916
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,467
and my father
and brother

917
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:50,467
have asked me
to come to you

918
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:53,433
to try to get
the figure, uh...

919
00:42:53,467 --> 00:42:55,433
Down.

920
00:42:57,833 --> 00:43:00,300
So I thought this might be
a good time

921
00:43:00,333 --> 00:43:02,000
for a family meeting--

922
00:43:02,033 --> 00:43:04,967
a chance to give you guys
a little update.

923
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,433
Stuart, I got to
pick up Kyle

924
00:43:06,467 --> 00:43:07,900
at the pool.

925
00:43:07,933 --> 00:43:10,333
What's this about?

926
00:43:10,367 --> 00:43:14,367
O.k., um, let's see.

927
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:19,467
I, um, talked
to Mr. Egeberg,

928
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:24,033
and, um, it did not
go well.

929
00:43:24,067 --> 00:43:25,633
You fucked up.

930
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,033
Yes.

931
00:43:28,067 --> 00:43:29,733
Oh!

932
00:43:30,967 --> 00:43:32,733
So he won't
change the price.

933
00:43:32,767 --> 00:43:35,733
Uh, no, actually,
he did...

934
00:43:35,767 --> 00:43:38,633
He did
change the price.

935
00:43:38,667 --> 00:43:41,867
Now he wants...

936
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:44,133
Uh...

937
00:43:44,167 --> 00:43:46,667
10,000.

938
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,900
I don't
deserve this!

939
00:43:49,933 --> 00:43:51,433
Oh, sure, you do.

940
00:43:51,467 --> 00:43:52,900
It was your idea

941
00:43:52,933 --> 00:43:54,467
to have this moron
talk to the man.

942
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:58,500
Wait a minute!
Hold on!

943
00:43:58,533 --> 00:44:00,133
We still have
the letter.

944
00:44:00,167 --> 00:44:01,867
He cannot do this!

945
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:03,433
That's right.
That's right.

946
00:44:03,467 --> 00:44:04,900
We have
the letter.

947
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:05,967
What letter?

948
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,200
The letter from egeberg.

949
00:44:08,233 --> 00:44:10,400
O.k., this is
interesting.

950
00:44:10,433 --> 00:44:12,033
I talked
to a lawyer,

951
00:44:12,067 --> 00:44:13,900
who I'm paying for
myself,

952
00:44:13,933 --> 00:44:15,833
and he's
a very good lawyer.

953
00:44:15,867 --> 00:44:17,333
He went to Yale,

954
00:44:17,367 --> 00:44:19,067
where the Clintons
went.

955
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:20,567
And he said

956
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,400
that by asking
Mr. Egeberg

957
00:44:22,433 --> 00:44:25,533
to lower his price,
we essentially

958
00:44:25,567 --> 00:44:28,300
revoked
our agreement.

959
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:29,800
He can do this.

960
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:31,600
The letter's
no good.

961
00:44:31,633 --> 00:44:33,400
I need a drink.

962
00:44:33,433 --> 00:44:36,467
I will never
escape this shit!

963
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:37,967
Stop it! Jesus Christ!

964
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,600
The only thing
that's wrong

965
00:44:39,633 --> 00:44:41,767
with this family
is that we don't

966
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,300
stand up
for ourselves.

967
00:44:43,333 --> 00:44:45,867
Now, when you talked
to this asshole,

968
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:48,267
were you two alone?

969
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:49,767
Yes.

970
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,267
No one around?

971
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:53,267
No, no one around.

972
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:55,833
Oh, sorry,
I didn't
go to Yale.

973
00:44:55,867 --> 00:44:57,333
Yes!

974
00:44:57,367 --> 00:44:58,800
Will someone
please tell me

975
00:44:58,833 --> 00:45:00,333
what's happening?

976
00:45:00,367 --> 00:45:03,733
The conversation
never took place.

977
00:45:06,133 --> 00:45:08,300
You know I can't
do that, Donnie.

978
00:45:08,333 --> 00:45:09,800
Well, you're
just going to

979
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:11,267
have to choose
between US

980
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:12,700
and egeberg!

981
00:45:12,733 --> 00:45:15,633
No, between you
and the truth.

982
00:45:15,667 --> 00:45:17,467
Oh, Jesus.

983
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:19,333
The truth?

984
00:45:21,667 --> 00:45:23,367
I'll be right back.

985
00:45:25,467 --> 00:45:27,367
Anybody else
want a drink?

986
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,900
Ha ha ha!

987
00:45:28,933 --> 00:45:30,467
Stuart,

988
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,733
I know Donnie can
be unreasonable--

989
00:45:32,767 --> 00:45:34,300
he almost sued me--

990
00:45:34,333 --> 00:45:35,800
but he's very smart.

991
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:37,500
Sometimes he has
some good ideas.

992
00:45:37,533 --> 00:45:39,133
So please, please
don't dismiss

993
00:45:39,167 --> 00:45:40,633
this lying thing

994
00:45:40,667 --> 00:45:42,500
just because Donnie
thought of it.

995
00:45:42,533 --> 00:45:44,567
All right. Let's talk
about the truth.

996
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,767
Some for you.

997
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,467
Some for you.

998
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,533
Some for you.

999
00:45:52,433 --> 00:45:55,933
Xerox copies
of Stuart's journal.

1000
00:45:55,967 --> 00:45:58,533
I've taken the Liberty
of underlining

1001
00:45:58,567 --> 00:46:01,267
some of the more
fascinating entries.

1002
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,767
"I am disgusted

1003
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,400
"with each
and every member

1004
00:46:04,433 --> 00:46:05,933
of my family"?

1005
00:46:05,967 --> 00:46:08,933
"I forgot how much
I hate my mother."

1006
00:46:08,967 --> 00:46:13,367
"Big...stinking...
Drunk."

1007
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:19,667
Well, nice being home.

1008
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:23,533
I'm just going to go
pack a few things.

1009
00:46:25,833 --> 00:46:27,300
Oh, no, no.

1010
00:46:27,333 --> 00:46:28,767
It's not
that easy, buddy boy.

1011
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,267
We'll see you in court!

1012
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:32,033
[Crying]

1013
00:46:32,067 --> 00:46:33,900
Mother.

1014
00:46:37,633 --> 00:46:38,833
Now!

1015
00:46:38,867 --> 00:46:40,333
Today I declare
emotional independence

1016
00:46:40,367 --> 00:46:41,567
from my family.

1017
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,400
Whoo!

1018
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:45,067
Oh!

1019
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:47,267
Now, come on.
You do it. Your turn.

1020
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:50,600
[Crowd cheers]

1021
00:46:50,633 --> 00:46:52,300
Oh, no.

1022
00:46:52,333 --> 00:46:53,933
Come on. It's fun.

1023
00:46:53,967 --> 00:46:55,867
No. I don't
want to.

1024
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:58,233
Why not?
It feels good.

1025
00:46:58,267 --> 00:47:00,733
No. I can't.

1026
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:18,300
So you never
go back home?

1027
00:47:18,333 --> 00:47:20,000
Nah.

1028
00:47:24,933 --> 00:47:26,700
And your mom
just never talked

1029
00:47:26,733 --> 00:47:28,733
about how
it happened?

1030
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:31,833
It's not really hard
to figure out.

1031
00:47:31,867 --> 00:47:34,233
She was married
to a drunk.

1032
00:47:34,267 --> 00:47:37,233
This charming,
attractive guy
comes along.

1033
00:47:37,267 --> 00:47:39,467
They have a fling,

1034
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:42,000
and nine months
later, me.

1035
00:47:42,033 --> 00:47:44,233
You ever meet him?

1036
00:47:45,833 --> 00:47:49,967
About two years ago,
I tracked him down.

1037
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,367
He lives
in St. Louis.

1038
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,700
Wife and family.

1039
00:47:54,733 --> 00:47:57,567
So I wrote him
at work.

1040
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:00,100
"Dear Mr. Ahern,
you don't know me.

1041
00:48:00,133 --> 00:48:02,033
"I'm your daughter.

1042
00:48:02,067 --> 00:48:04,133
"My other dad
knew I wasn't his,

1043
00:48:04,167 --> 00:48:06,300
so he hit me a lot."

1044
00:48:06,333 --> 00:48:09,300
Succinct.

1045
00:48:09,333 --> 00:48:11,300
So I sent off
the letter

1046
00:48:11,333 --> 00:48:13,233
with a picture
of myself,

1047
00:48:13,267 --> 00:48:15,267
and a few weeks
later,

1048
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:17,133
I get
this phone call.

1049
00:48:17,167 --> 00:48:19,067
He's coming up
to Chicago on business.

1050
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:20,767
Can we have dinner?

1051
00:48:21,967 --> 00:48:24,900
Stuart, I was
so excited.

1052
00:48:24,933 --> 00:48:27,400
"I'm going to meet
my father!"

1053
00:48:28,667 --> 00:48:30,667
Well, I walk
into the restaurant,

1054
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,667
and I realize

1055
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:35,600
I have no idea
what he looks like.

1056
00:48:35,633 --> 00:48:37,867
Then this guy
walks in...

1057
00:48:40,333 --> 00:48:42,033
About 55...

1058
00:48:43,667 --> 00:48:45,667
Very distinguished...

1059
00:48:49,233 --> 00:48:53,200
And he has my eyes...

1060
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,567
And my nose.

1061
00:49:01,467 --> 00:49:04,133
This is my dad.

1062
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:08,067
We had
a lovely dinner.

1063
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:11,367
He was very nice,
very charming.

1064
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:14,967
And as we
were leaving,

1065
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,833
in the parking lot...

1066
00:49:18,733 --> 00:49:21,100
He made a pass.

1067
00:49:21,133 --> 00:49:22,933
Jeez.

1068
00:49:29,867 --> 00:49:32,733
So I am moving past
the family stuff

1069
00:49:32,767 --> 00:49:35,633
and putting the focus
where it belongs--

1070
00:49:35,667 --> 00:49:38,233
on me...

1071
00:49:38,267 --> 00:49:41,900
And my inability
to trust men.

1072
00:49:43,833 --> 00:49:45,733
Oh!

1073
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,967
I guess
you got to accept

1074
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,100
that you just
never had a father.

1075
00:50:04,133 --> 00:50:08,500
So from now on,
when you need one,

1076
00:50:08,533 --> 00:50:11,800
I'll be your dad.
O.K.?

1077
00:50:11,833 --> 00:50:16,100
You know, when you're
not being my mom.

1078
00:50:22,133 --> 00:50:24,400
I'm so proud of you.

1079
00:50:25,767 --> 00:50:28,433
I love you so much.

1080
00:50:28,467 --> 00:50:32,433
You're such
a wonderful girl.

1081
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,567
[Bicycle bells ringing]

1082
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:59,033
I mean, you really
are doing great...

1083
00:50:59,067 --> 00:51:01,033
Considering,
you know, the abuse

1084
00:51:01,067 --> 00:51:03,033
and your real father
hitting on you

1085
00:51:03,067 --> 00:51:04,533
and everything.

1086
00:51:04,567 --> 00:51:06,467
Oh, yeah. I'm doing
just great.

1087
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:07,967
Well, you are.

1088
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,667
You got lots
and lots of friends

1089
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:11,133
and a great career.

1090
00:51:11,167 --> 00:51:12,767
I couldn't
keep a show

1091
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,267
on public access,

1092
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:15,900
and that's
supposed to be

1093
00:51:15,933 --> 00:51:17,533
some kind of
constitutional
right.

1094
00:51:17,567 --> 00:51:19,000
That was not
your fault.

1095
00:51:19,033 --> 00:51:20,800
Well...

1096
00:51:23,667 --> 00:51:25,133
Do you ever watch

1097
00:51:25,167 --> 00:51:26,633
the health cable
network?

1098
00:51:26,667 --> 00:51:28,133
I tried.

1099
00:51:28,167 --> 00:51:30,833
They had this whole
eyeball operation.

1100
00:51:30,867 --> 00:51:32,433
I almost threw up.

1101
00:51:32,467 --> 00:51:34,433
Well, they also have

1102
00:51:34,467 --> 00:51:36,533
some pretty good
new-age stuff.

1103
00:51:36,567 --> 00:51:38,500
Maybe you should
send them a tape.

1104
00:51:38,533 --> 00:51:40,000
See, the thing is

1105
00:51:40,033 --> 00:51:42,000
I never actually
taped my show.

1106
00:51:42,033 --> 00:51:44,100
I was always
too scared to watch.

1107
00:51:44,133 --> 00:51:46,400
Oh, great.
That's healthy.

1108
00:51:46,433 --> 00:51:47,900
Marlon Brando
never watched

1109
00:51:47,933 --> 00:51:49,400
any of his movies.

1110
00:51:49,433 --> 00:51:51,500
He evidently had
the same problem.

1111
00:51:51,533 --> 00:51:54,800
Stuart, somebody
must have a tape.

1112
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:59,800
Yeah.

1113
00:52:07,967 --> 00:52:09,633
Hi.

1114
00:52:11,533 --> 00:52:13,733
Um, Stuart smalley
to pick up a tape

1115
00:52:13,767 --> 00:52:15,567
and leave.

1116
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,800
Oh, yes.
It's right here,
but I'm sorry.

1117
00:52:17,833 --> 00:52:19,633
Ms. Weinstock said

1118
00:52:19,667 --> 00:52:21,833
she wanted to talk
to you first.

1119
00:52:21,867 --> 00:52:24,733
I'm sure she's--
she's very busy.

1120
00:52:24,767 --> 00:52:26,233
I'm sorry.

1121
00:52:26,267 --> 00:52:28,233
Ms. Weinstock said

1122
00:52:28,267 --> 00:52:31,100
that the tape
would cost $400.

1123
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:33,800
I'm sorry.

1124
00:52:33,833 --> 00:52:35,933
Maybe that's
what she wanted
to talk about.

1125
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:37,933
Sorry.

1126
00:52:43,767 --> 00:52:45,233
[Roz]
Yeah?

1127
00:52:45,267 --> 00:52:46,733
Ms. Weinstock?
Yes. I'm sorry.

1128
00:52:46,767 --> 00:52:48,533
I just wanted
to let you know

1129
00:52:48,567 --> 00:52:50,267
that Stuart smalley
is still here.

1130
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:51,767
I'm in a meeting.

1131
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,233
I was wondering if
it would be all right

1132
00:52:53,267 --> 00:52:56,033
if I went
on my lunch break.

1133
00:52:56,067 --> 00:52:57,667
Oh, a half an hour.

1134
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:59,167
That's too long.

1135
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,167
Oh, o.K. 20 minutes.

1136
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,367
All right. I'm sorry.

1137
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,167
Could I bring you
back something?

1138
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,833
Oh, no, thank you.

1139
00:53:08,867 --> 00:53:11,200
Sorry.

1140
00:53:14,133 --> 00:53:16,133
I'll be back
in 20 minutes.

1141
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,867
Sorry.

1142
00:53:50,567 --> 00:53:52,300
Sorry. Sorry.

1143
00:54:01,433 --> 00:54:03,167
The rest is
self-explanatory.

1144
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,300
The prospectus
pretty much
tells it all.

1145
00:54:05,333 --> 00:54:07,133
I'll be happy
to answer any
questions.

1146
00:54:07,167 --> 00:54:09,900
When exactly
do the bonds mature?

1147
00:54:09,933 --> 00:54:12,367
The munis mature
in 10 years,

1148
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:15,167
treasuries
in 15...Months.

1149
00:54:21,167 --> 00:54:22,633
I'm sorry.

1150
00:54:22,667 --> 00:54:24,367
This is
inappropriate.

1151
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,067
Can I see you
for a second, please?

1152
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:29,367
Stuart, you have to
return the tape.

1153
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,100
I know. You're right.

1154
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,833
Ted, how fast
can you copy this?

1155
00:54:34,867 --> 00:54:36,467
For you?
Right away.

1156
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:40,000
Oh, god.
Oh, god.

1157
00:54:46,833 --> 00:54:48,533
Sorry! Sorry!

1158
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:56,067
Ah...

1159
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:58,333
I decided to...

1160
00:54:58,367 --> 00:55:00,500
Get something...

1161
00:55:00,533 --> 00:55:02,067
To eat.

1162
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:04,367
Oh, I could have
gotten you something.

1163
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:05,867
I'm sorry.

1164
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:08,300
No. I'm--
I'm sorry.

1165
00:55:08,333 --> 00:55:10,233
I...

1166
00:55:10,267 --> 00:55:12,500
I lied.
I didn't eat.

1167
00:55:12,533 --> 00:55:14,767
That's o.K.

1168
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:16,433
Aren't you
going to ask me

1169
00:55:16,467 --> 00:55:17,967
why I lied--

1170
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,800
what I did
after I left?

1171
00:55:19,833 --> 00:55:21,300
I'm sorry.

1172
00:55:21,333 --> 00:55:22,867
Would you
like me to?

1173
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:24,367
Is one
of your parents

1174
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:25,867
an alcoholic?

1175
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:27,400
I'm sorry.

1176
00:55:27,433 --> 00:55:28,900
That's a personal
question.

1177
00:55:28,933 --> 00:55:31,467
That's o.K.

1178
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:33,000
Right after
you left,

1179
00:55:33,033 --> 00:55:35,133
I grabbed this tape
from your desk

1180
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:37,367
and ran out
and had it copied.

1181
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,067
[Man]
So I call the show

1182
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:40,633
Mike's makeover

1183
00:55:40,667 --> 00:55:43,100
and just change
my name to Mike--

1184
00:55:43,133 --> 00:55:45,133
not legally,
of course.

1185
00:55:45,167 --> 00:55:47,600
You are the lowest.

1186
00:55:47,633 --> 00:55:50,467
Well, then,
Seth's makeover,

1187
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:52,200
I guess.

1188
00:55:56,933 --> 00:55:59,033
This tape
is the property

1189
00:55:59,067 --> 00:56:01,867
of the Chicago
public access
corporation.

1190
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:04,633
Copying it without
my permission

1191
00:56:04,667 --> 00:56:07,500
is a federal
offense.

1192
00:56:09,833 --> 00:56:11,533
And, mea,

1193
00:56:11,567 --> 00:56:13,333
I'm sorry.

1194
00:56:14,667 --> 00:56:16,433
You're fired.

1195
00:56:19,567 --> 00:56:26,600
You are a hairless,
disgusting, sadistic...

1196
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:28,067
Vagina!

1197
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:30,133
[Echoing]
Gina! Gina! Gina!

1198
00:56:31,533 --> 00:56:33,500
Since the tape
is a recording

1199
00:56:33,533 --> 00:56:35,500
of programs written
and performed by yourself,

1200
00:56:35,533 --> 00:56:37,400
and since
the $400 figure

1201
00:56:37,433 --> 00:56:39,433
so egregiously exceeds
the fair market value

1202
00:56:39,467 --> 00:56:41,267
of labor and materials,

1203
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:43,300
there would be
absolutely no basis

1204
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:45,100
for Ms. Weinstock's
complaint,

1205
00:56:45,133 --> 00:56:47,400
should she decide
to file one.

1206
00:56:48,667 --> 00:56:50,600
Go away.

1207
00:56:50,633 --> 00:56:53,133
Thanks, Bob.
Appreciate it.

1208
00:56:54,633 --> 00:56:56,833
Stuart, there's
something else.

1209
00:56:56,867 --> 00:56:59,500
I talked to
the health cable network.

1210
00:56:59,533 --> 00:57:01,767
They love your tape!

1211
00:57:03,933 --> 00:57:05,400
Yes!

1212
00:57:05,433 --> 00:57:06,833
Oh, yes!

1213
00:57:06,867 --> 00:57:08,633
Yes! Yes!
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1214
00:57:08,667 --> 00:57:10,167
Oh!

1215
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:12,867
They want me to do
five shows a week
for four weeks.

1216
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:14,433
Outstanding.

1217
00:57:14,467 --> 00:57:16,033
And they're paying you.

1218
00:57:16,067 --> 00:57:17,533
And they're
paying me.

1219
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:19,033
Fred, they're
paying me!

1220
00:57:19,067 --> 00:57:21,600
I still can't
believe it.

1221
00:57:21,633 --> 00:57:24,300
You start taping
a week from Monday.

1222
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:27,067
That soon.

1223
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:29,233
Well, that's...
That's good.

1224
00:57:29,267 --> 00:57:31,233
Gives me less time
to worry.

1225
00:57:31,267 --> 00:57:32,733
Oh, boy.

1226
00:57:32,767 --> 00:57:34,233
Would you
enjoy this,

1227
00:57:34,267 --> 00:57:35,733
for god's sake?

1228
00:57:35,767 --> 00:57:37,700
I can't.

1229
00:57:37,733 --> 00:57:39,333
When anything good
ever happens,

1230
00:57:39,367 --> 00:57:40,833
I'm always waiting

1231
00:57:40,867 --> 00:57:42,833
for the other shoe
to drop.

1232
00:57:42,867 --> 00:57:44,333
That might make

1233
00:57:44,367 --> 00:57:45,900
a good topic
for a show.

1234
00:57:45,933 --> 00:57:47,533
Stuart, you need
to stop worrying

1235
00:57:47,567 --> 00:57:49,033
about all 20 shows.

1236
00:57:49,067 --> 00:57:51,033
Let's just take it one
show at a time. O.K.?

1237
00:57:51,067 --> 00:57:53,267
O.k.

1238
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:55,167
Oh, Stuart, look.

1239
00:57:56,133 --> 00:57:57,633
Mr. Smalley?

1240
00:57:57,667 --> 00:57:59,133
Yeah.

1241
00:57:59,167 --> 00:58:00,633
Stan brunner.
I'm the director.

1242
00:58:00,667 --> 00:58:02,167
Thanks for
coming down. Hi.

1243
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:03,700
Just want
to put you

1244
00:58:03,733 --> 00:58:05,233
in front
of the camera

1245
00:58:05,267 --> 00:58:07,133
and make sure everything
is set for this afternoon.

1246
00:58:07,167 --> 00:58:08,400
Have a seat up there.

1247
00:58:08,433 --> 00:58:10,333
Thank you.

1248
00:58:11,367 --> 00:58:13,600
He's a little nervous.

1249
00:58:13,633 --> 00:58:15,600
We'll get him
in and out
in a jiffy.

1250
00:58:15,633 --> 00:58:17,100
You have
some lunch.

1251
00:58:17,133 --> 00:58:18,767
This afternoon
will go bang,
bang, bang.

1252
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:20,600
Stuart, can you turn
in to the mirror,
please?

1253
00:58:20,633 --> 00:58:22,100
Sure.

1254
00:58:22,133 --> 00:58:24,600
You know,
I like this already.

1255
00:58:24,633 --> 00:58:26,600
At the old place,
nobody cared.

1256
00:58:26,633 --> 00:58:29,533
If the show was a disaster,
it was a disaster.

1257
00:58:29,567 --> 00:58:32,500
We've got you down
for 20 shows, right?

1258
00:58:32,533 --> 00:58:35,933
Yes. Four weeks,
five shows a week.

1259
00:58:35,967 --> 00:58:37,433
Well, it's going to
be tight

1260
00:58:37,467 --> 00:58:39,500
because they're
only giving US
four hours.

1261
00:58:39,533 --> 00:58:40,533
Per show?

1262
00:58:40,567 --> 00:58:42,833
Ha ha ha!
Yeah, right.

1263
00:58:43,933 --> 00:58:46,700
O.k., looking good.

1264
00:58:46,733 --> 00:58:48,167
Excuse me.

1265
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:49,667
You're not suggesting
that you're taping

1266
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:51,600
all 20 shows
this afternoon?

1267
00:58:51,633 --> 00:58:53,100
Don't worry
about US.

1268
00:58:53,133 --> 00:58:54,600
We do this
all the time.

1269
00:58:54,633 --> 00:58:55,933
Frankly,
it's your friend

1270
00:58:55,967 --> 00:58:57,733
I'm a little
worried about.

1271
00:58:59,567 --> 00:59:02,533
God, Grant me
the Serenity...

1272
00:59:02,567 --> 00:59:05,033
Everybody came down,
and we brainstormed

1273
00:59:05,067 --> 00:59:07,100
and came up
with 20 topics.

1274
00:59:07,133 --> 00:59:09,100
Well, 19, actually--

1275
00:59:09,133 --> 00:59:12,100
number 20 is
I don't have to have a topic.

1276
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:23,100
Carl felt
my first show should be

1277
00:59:23,133 --> 00:59:24,967
today, I will
own my panic,

1278
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,300
since it would
be very "in the now,"

1279
00:59:27,333 --> 00:59:29,800
but I thought
I had a better idea.

1280
00:59:29,833 --> 00:59:32,967
Hello.
I'm Stuart smalley,

1281
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,733
and I am so delighted
to be here,

1282
00:59:35,767 --> 00:59:37,267
and for my first show,

1283
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:39,100
I've decided
to demonstrate

1284
00:59:39,133 --> 00:59:44,100
just how powerful a tool
the daily affirmation can be.

1285
00:59:44,133 --> 00:59:45,600
You see, all my life,

1286
00:59:45,633 --> 00:59:48,100
I've heard the same things
over and over again.

1287
00:59:48,133 --> 00:59:50,100
"Stuart, you're not
good enough.

1288
00:59:50,133 --> 00:59:52,100
"Stuart,
you're not smart enough.

1289
00:59:52,133 --> 00:59:54,600
"Oh, and by the way,
Stuart,

1290
00:59:54,633 --> 00:59:56,600
no one likes you."

1291
00:59:56,633 --> 00:59:59,600
You know who's saying
all these horrible things?

1292
00:59:59,633 --> 01:00:02,100
My mom? Well, yeah.

1293
01:00:02,133 --> 01:00:04,600
My dad? Him, too,

1294
01:00:04,633 --> 01:00:07,600
but mainly these words
were coming from me.

1295
01:00:07,633 --> 01:00:09,100
That's right--
the little Stuart

1296
01:00:09,133 --> 01:00:10,600
that sits inside my brain,

1297
01:00:10,633 --> 01:00:13,533
criticizing
every little thing I do.

1298
01:00:13,567 --> 01:00:15,033
Well, today,

1299
01:00:15,067 --> 01:00:17,533
to show how
the daily affirmation works,

1300
01:00:17,567 --> 01:00:19,033
I've invited someone

1301
01:00:19,067 --> 01:00:21,033
who has even less
self-esteem than I do,

1302
01:00:21,067 --> 01:00:22,567
if you can believe that.

1303
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:25,033
We'll call her
mea c.

1304
01:00:25,067 --> 01:00:27,033
To protect
her anonymity,

1305
01:00:27,067 --> 01:00:28,533
and, mea,
first of all,

1306
01:00:28,567 --> 01:00:30,033
I want to thank you
for doing this.

1307
01:00:30,067 --> 01:00:32,033
I know how much
courage it took.

1308
01:00:32,067 --> 01:00:34,033
Mea, can you
hear me?

1309
01:00:34,067 --> 01:00:35,533
Yes.

1310
01:00:35,567 --> 01:00:37,033
I'm sorry.

1311
01:00:37,067 --> 01:00:39,533
You look a little
nervous, mea.

1312
01:00:39,567 --> 01:00:41,533
Maybe try
to relax a little.

1313
01:00:41,567 --> 01:00:43,033
Sorry.

1314
01:00:43,067 --> 01:00:47,033
Maybe if you just
unclenched your,
uh, body.

1315
01:00:47,067 --> 01:00:49,533
Your whole body
looks a little--
a little tight.

1316
01:00:49,567 --> 01:00:52,033
Take--take
a cleansing--

1317
01:00:52,067 --> 01:00:54,267
big, cleansing
breath.

1318
01:00:56,067 --> 01:00:57,533
Good. Good.

1319
01:00:57,567 --> 01:00:59,033
Very, very good.

1320
01:00:59,067 --> 01:01:01,100
Now, mea,
I want you...

1321
01:01:01,133 --> 01:01:03,600
To look
in this mirror.

1322
01:01:03,633 --> 01:01:05,100
Don't look at me.

1323
01:01:05,133 --> 01:01:06,600
Only you can
help you.

1324
01:01:06,633 --> 01:01:08,100
That's it.
Look in the mirror.

1325
01:01:08,133 --> 01:01:09,600
Now, see how pretty
you are?

1326
01:01:09,633 --> 01:01:12,800
Let's--let's take
those glasses...Off.

1327
01:01:13,933 --> 01:01:16,033
Oh, good, good.

1328
01:01:16,067 --> 01:01:18,867
O.k. Let's--let's
put the glasses
back on.

1329
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:22,033
You look very pretty
with the glasses.

1330
01:01:22,067 --> 01:01:23,667
Sorry. Thank you.

1331
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:25,300
Mea, have you
ever noticed

1332
01:01:25,333 --> 01:01:26,833
that you apologize
a lot?

1333
01:01:26,867 --> 01:01:28,533
Oh, I'm sorry. Do I?

1334
01:01:28,567 --> 01:01:30,067
Yes, you do.

1335
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:33,033
I guess--no, that's
exactly the point,
you see.

1336
01:01:33,067 --> 01:01:36,033
I want you to look
in that mirror, mea,

1337
01:01:36,067 --> 01:01:39,533
and I want you
to repeat after me.

1338
01:01:39,567 --> 01:01:44,533
"I am a worthy
human being."

1339
01:01:44,567 --> 01:01:46,533
[Mumbles]

1340
01:01:46,567 --> 01:01:48,533
O.k., I really
couldn't hear you.

1341
01:01:48,567 --> 01:01:50,033
Try it again.

1342
01:01:50,067 --> 01:01:51,533
Oh. O.K.

1343
01:01:51,567 --> 01:01:53,733
I'm a worthy
human being?

1344
01:01:53,767 --> 01:01:56,600
No, mea. It's
not a question.

1345
01:01:56,633 --> 01:01:58,533
Try it again.

1346
01:01:58,567 --> 01:02:00,100
I'm...

1347
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:01,867
I'm sorry. What is
the second part?

1348
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:03,033
"Worthy human
being--

1349
01:02:03,067 --> 01:02:04,533
I am a worthy
human being."

1350
01:02:04,567 --> 01:02:06,600
Just say it.

1351
01:02:06,633 --> 01:02:09,233
Am I saying it
to you or to myself?

1352
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:10,733
Just say it.

1353
01:02:10,767 --> 01:02:12,267
"I am a worthy
human being."

1354
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:13,633
I'm a worthy
human being.

1355
01:02:13,667 --> 01:02:15,033
O.k., now louder.

1356
01:02:15,067 --> 01:02:16,367
I am a worthy
human being.

1357
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,533
O.k., mean it.

1358
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:18,867
I am a worthy
human being!

1359
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:20,033
Believe it.

1360
01:02:20,067 --> 01:02:22,033
I hate you, mom!

1361
01:02:22,067 --> 01:02:23,633
Sorry.

1362
01:02:23,667 --> 01:02:25,133
No, that was--

1363
01:02:25,167 --> 01:02:26,633
that was
interesting.

1364
01:02:26,667 --> 01:02:28,200
That was
actually good.

1365
01:02:28,233 --> 01:02:30,267
I think we're--
I think we're
getting somewhere.

1366
01:02:31,567 --> 01:02:33,033
Uh, do you think

1367
01:02:33,067 --> 01:02:34,533
your mom might
be watching?

1368
01:02:34,567 --> 01:02:36,033
She's dead.

1369
01:02:36,067 --> 01:02:37,767
Oh, good.

1370
01:02:39,533 --> 01:02:41,467
The rest of the shows
went great

1371
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:44,067
except for the I don't have
to have a topic show,

1372
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:47,533
in which I just blanked
for five straight minutes,

1373
01:02:47,567 --> 01:02:49,300
but the health cable
network people were happy

1374
01:02:49,333 --> 01:02:50,700
with the 19 good shows

1375
01:02:50,733 --> 01:02:53,033
and have decided to play
the first one twice.

1376
01:02:53,067 --> 01:02:54,533
It was that good.

1377
01:02:54,567 --> 01:02:55,700
Look at me.

1378
01:02:55,733 --> 01:02:56,867
Look at me!

1379
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:58,367
Talk to me.
I'm a human being.

1380
01:02:58,400 --> 01:02:59,533
I'm a human being!

1381
01:02:59,567 --> 01:03:00,767
Darn you, mom.

1382
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:01,867
Darn you, mom!

1383
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:04,100
The response has
been tremendous.

1384
01:03:04,133 --> 01:03:06,100
We want to start
running the show

1385
01:03:06,133 --> 01:03:07,600
three times a day.

1386
01:03:07,633 --> 01:03:09,100
That's great, Andy.

1387
01:03:09,133 --> 01:03:11,533
So what kind of bump
are we talking about?

1388
01:03:11,567 --> 01:03:12,867
Bump?

1389
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:16,033
Well, we up it
to...100 a show

1390
01:03:16,067 --> 01:03:18,667
and 25 per repeat viewing?

1391
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:21,033
Oh, that's o.K.
You don't have
to give me a bump.

1392
01:03:21,067 --> 01:03:22,533
That's 750 a week.

1393
01:03:22,567 --> 01:03:24,167
Not to mention specials.

1394
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:26,533
Ha ha! Specials.

1395
01:03:26,567 --> 01:03:28,767
He'll sleep on it,
Andy. Thanks.

1396
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:30,533
Give me a call.

1397
01:03:30,567 --> 01:03:33,533
750! I could--
I could get a car.

1398
01:03:33,567 --> 01:03:35,033
The money's not
the important thing.

1399
01:03:35,067 --> 01:03:37,533
What's important
is that you've
found a place

1400
01:03:37,567 --> 01:03:39,033
that really
appreciates you,

1401
01:03:39,067 --> 01:03:41,533
and that's all you
ever really wanted--

1402
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:43,033
a little
appreciation.

1403
01:03:43,067 --> 01:03:44,533
And I could get a car.

1404
01:03:44,567 --> 01:03:46,033
Excuse me,
Mr. Smalley.

1405
01:03:46,067 --> 01:03:47,533
I'm Tina best.
I work in sales.

1406
01:03:47,567 --> 01:03:49,033
Could I get
your autograph?

1407
01:03:49,067 --> 01:03:50,533
Oh, sure, Tina.

1408
01:03:50,567 --> 01:03:52,033
I just love
your show.

1409
01:03:52,067 --> 01:03:53,533
Oh, you do?

1410
01:03:53,567 --> 01:03:55,033
I think
it's wonderful.

1411
01:03:55,067 --> 01:03:57,033
Oh, thank you
very much, Tina.
That's so nice.

1412
01:03:57,067 --> 01:03:58,533
Thank you.

1413
01:03:58,567 --> 01:04:00,100
Ha ha ha!

1414
01:04:00,133 --> 01:04:02,100
I signed an autograph.

1415
01:04:02,133 --> 01:04:03,600
Excuse me.

1416
01:04:03,633 --> 01:04:05,100
Yes.

1417
01:04:05,133 --> 01:04:06,600
Hi. You Mr. Smalley?

1418
01:04:06,633 --> 01:04:08,100
Yes, I am.

1419
01:04:08,133 --> 01:04:09,833
Ha ha ha!

1420
01:04:12,067 --> 01:04:14,000
[Stuart]
Oh, wait!

1421
01:04:14,033 --> 01:04:15,533
You forget your, uh...

1422
01:04:15,567 --> 01:04:17,267
Subpoena.

1423
01:04:19,733 --> 01:04:23,100
[Stuart]
So basically, the strategy is,

1424
01:04:23,133 --> 01:04:24,533
you get me to lie

1425
01:04:24,567 --> 01:04:26,033
because if I don't,

1426
01:04:26,067 --> 01:04:27,867
everyone goes to jail
for perjury.

1427
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:29,433
That's your plan?

1428
01:04:29,467 --> 01:04:31,767
That's about
the size of it.

1429
01:04:32,667 --> 01:04:34,433
Stuart, what's
the big deal?

1430
01:04:34,467 --> 01:04:36,367
The guy had a stroke.
He's a goner.

1431
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:37,867
It's your word
against a dead man's.

1432
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:40,033
All you have to do
is take the stand

1433
01:04:40,067 --> 01:04:42,933
and say your conversation
with egeberg never
took place.

1434
01:04:42,967 --> 01:04:44,933
Look.

1435
01:04:44,967 --> 01:04:50,033
I work a program
based on rigorous honesty,

1436
01:04:50,067 --> 01:04:52,733
and most of all,
that means

1437
01:04:52,767 --> 01:04:54,733
being honest...

1438
01:04:54,767 --> 01:04:56,367
With yourself.

1439
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:57,933
Christ.

1440
01:04:57,967 --> 01:04:59,533
Stuart,

1441
01:04:59,567 --> 01:05:01,467
egeberg's nephew
now wants

1442
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:03,733
20,000
for the easement!

1443
01:05:03,767 --> 01:05:05,767
Huh?
He can do that?

1444
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:07,367
He's an asshole.

1445
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:08,900
The man is extorting
your family,

1446
01:05:08,933 --> 01:05:11,100
and all because--
I'm sorry to put it
this way,

1447
01:05:11,133 --> 01:05:12,933
but all because
of how badly you mishandled

1448
01:05:12,967 --> 01:05:14,433
your duties as executor.

1449
01:05:14,467 --> 01:05:17,033
Stuart, you know
I want my share
of the inheritance

1450
01:05:17,067 --> 01:05:18,900
so I can move out
of mom and dad's.

1451
01:05:18,933 --> 01:05:21,667
He's really dying
to get out.

1452
01:05:23,567 --> 01:05:25,067
[Donnie]
But forget about me.

1453
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:27,533
Think about Jodie--

1454
01:05:27,567 --> 01:05:29,533
Kyle.

1455
01:05:29,567 --> 01:05:31,533
You see where we live,

1456
01:05:31,567 --> 01:05:34,033
and Kyle sleeps
on the couch.

1457
01:05:34,067 --> 01:05:36,467
I'd sleep on the couch
except for my back.

1458
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:38,533
Stuart,

1459
01:05:38,567 --> 01:05:40,533
I promise you,

1460
01:05:40,567 --> 01:05:42,533
if we get through
this today,

1461
01:05:42,567 --> 01:05:44,533
I will give my share

1462
01:05:44,567 --> 01:05:46,533
to Jodie...

1463
01:05:46,567 --> 01:05:48,033
Oh.

1464
01:05:48,067 --> 01:05:49,767
For Kyle.

1465
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:56,867
Do you swear
the testimony
you're about to give

1466
01:05:56,900 --> 01:05:58,367
is the truth,
the whole truth,

1467
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:00,600
and nothing
but the truth,
so help you god?

1468
01:06:00,633 --> 01:06:01,933
I do.

1469
01:06:01,967 --> 01:06:03,667
Please be seated.

1470
01:06:05,133 --> 01:06:07,600
Could you please
state your name
for the court?

1471
01:06:07,633 --> 01:06:09,100
Uh, merl egeberg.

1472
01:06:09,133 --> 01:06:12,533
And Orville egeberg
is your uncle?

1473
01:06:12,567 --> 01:06:13,933
Was...

1474
01:06:15,067 --> 01:06:16,667
He was my uncle.

1475
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:18,200
Yes. I'm very sorry.

1476
01:06:18,233 --> 01:06:20,033
You were with him,
weren't you--

1477
01:06:20,067 --> 01:06:21,867
at your uncle's side
when he passed away?

1478
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:24,033
Yes. Yes, I was.

1479
01:06:24,067 --> 01:06:26,033
And as he lay
on his deathbed,

1480
01:06:26,067 --> 01:06:27,533
did he say anything

1481
01:06:27,567 --> 01:06:29,033
about a member
of the smalley
family

1482
01:06:29,067 --> 01:06:30,533
approaching him
to renegotiate

1483
01:06:30,567 --> 01:06:32,033
the price
of the easement?

1484
01:06:32,067 --> 01:06:33,467
Yes. He told me--

1485
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:34,867
objection.

1486
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:36,333
Hearsay.

1487
01:06:36,367 --> 01:06:39,333
What law school
did you go to,
Mr. Von arks?

1488
01:06:39,367 --> 01:06:42,067
Dying declaration.

1489
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:43,600
Of course
it's admissible.

1490
01:06:43,633 --> 01:06:45,600
You're overruled.

1491
01:06:45,633 --> 01:06:47,333
Sit down!

1492
01:06:48,567 --> 01:06:50,200
Go ahead, Mr. Egeberg.

1493
01:06:50,233 --> 01:06:52,033
Ahem.

1494
01:06:52,067 --> 01:06:54,033
My uncle told me

1495
01:06:54,067 --> 01:06:57,033
that Stuart smalley
came to the door

1496
01:06:57,067 --> 01:07:00,100
to ask to renegotiate
the price of the easement.

1497
01:07:00,133 --> 01:07:02,100
Thank you.
No further
questions.

1498
01:07:02,133 --> 01:07:04,467
The defense calls
Stuart smalley.

1499
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:06,700
Stuart smalley!

1500
01:07:08,567 --> 01:07:09,967
When he said my name,

1501
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:13,633
I honestly did not know
what I was going to do.

1502
01:07:13,667 --> 01:07:18,400
I knew how much the money meant
to Jodie and--and Donnie

1503
01:07:18,433 --> 01:07:20,900
and how much dad
was counting on me,

1504
01:07:20,933 --> 01:07:24,467
and they'd all
made it sound so easy--lying--

1505
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:26,233
and I knew that if I did lie,

1506
01:07:26,267 --> 01:07:28,933
we'd win because
it would be my word

1507
01:07:28,967 --> 01:07:31,433
against a dead man's.

1508
01:07:34,833 --> 01:07:36,533
[Bailiff]
Raise your
right hand.

1509
01:07:36,567 --> 01:07:39,100
Do you swear
that the testimony
you're about to give

1510
01:07:39,133 --> 01:07:41,033
is the truth,
the whole truth,

1511
01:07:41,067 --> 01:07:42,667
and nothing
but the truth,

1512
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:44,433
so help you god?

1513
01:07:46,567 --> 01:07:48,267
It was all my fault.

1514
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:49,500
Objection!

1515
01:07:49,533 --> 01:07:51,200
Mr. Smalley, you haven't
been questioned yet.

1516
01:07:51,233 --> 01:07:54,633
Everything Mr. Egeberg's nephew
said is true.

1517
01:07:54,667 --> 01:07:56,500
Ohhh...

1518
01:07:56,533 --> 01:07:58,067
Objection!

1519
01:07:58,100 --> 01:07:59,933
Well, it is!

1520
01:07:59,967 --> 01:08:01,500
Your honor,
it's quite obvious

1521
01:08:01,533 --> 01:08:03,600
that this witness
is insane.

1522
01:08:03,633 --> 01:08:05,100
[Dad]
He's right!

1523
01:08:05,133 --> 01:08:06,600
My son's a nut!

1524
01:08:06,633 --> 01:08:08,100
[Judge]
Order! Order!

1525
01:08:08,133 --> 01:08:10,100
Judge, Stuart's
telling the truth.

1526
01:08:10,133 --> 01:08:12,100
We lied.

1527
01:08:12,133 --> 01:08:14,400
Quiet! Traitor!

1528
01:08:14,433 --> 01:08:16,867
[Judge]
Bailiff, I want order
in this courtroom.

1529
01:08:16,900 --> 01:08:18,267
No. It's o.K.

1530
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:19,367
Traitor!

1531
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:21,000
Order! Order!

1532
01:08:21,033 --> 01:08:22,533
[Donnie]
It's o.K., really!

1533
01:08:22,567 --> 01:08:24,967
It was a nightmare--

1534
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,533
the absolute low point
of my life,

1535
01:08:27,567 --> 01:08:29,500
which is saying something.

1536
01:08:30,467 --> 01:08:32,100
Of course, we lost,

1537
01:08:32,133 --> 01:08:34,100
but Mr. Egeberg's nephew
respected me

1538
01:08:34,133 --> 01:08:35,600
for telling the truth,

1539
01:08:35,633 --> 01:08:39,100
so he's charging US
only $10,000 for the easement,

1540
01:08:39,133 --> 01:08:41,100
but dad was mad anyway

1541
01:08:41,133 --> 01:08:43,600
because the judge found him
and Donnie guilty of perjury

1542
01:08:43,633 --> 01:08:45,100
and sentenced them each

1543
01:08:45,133 --> 01:08:46,600
to 100 hours
of community service

1544
01:08:46,633 --> 01:08:48,867
picking up garbage
along the highway,

1545
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:52,500
and all this pain
I caused everybody else

1546
01:08:52,533 --> 01:08:55,533
was caused by my need
to fix everything,

1547
01:08:55,567 --> 01:08:57,467
and I realized

1548
01:08:57,500 --> 01:09:01,033
that if I'm going to be
any good to anybody else,

1549
01:09:01,067 --> 01:09:04,033
then I have
to work on Stuart

1550
01:09:04,067 --> 01:09:07,433
because that's the only person
I can really fix--

1551
01:09:07,467 --> 01:09:08,800
me--

1552
01:09:08,833 --> 01:09:12,100
because what they say
is really true.

1553
01:09:12,133 --> 01:09:14,600
It is easier
to put on slippers

1554
01:09:14,633 --> 01:09:18,100
than to carpet
the entire world.

1555
01:09:18,133 --> 01:09:20,133
Well, this has been
a great show,

1556
01:09:20,167 --> 01:09:22,267
and you know what?
I deserve it...

1557
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:24,533
Because I'm good enough,

1558
01:09:24,567 --> 01:09:25,967
I'm smart enough,

1559
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,733
and doggone it,
people like me.

1560
01:09:28,767 --> 01:09:31,100
Well, stay tuned
for juice island.

1561
01:09:31,133 --> 01:09:32,800
Bye-bye.

1562
01:09:32,833 --> 01:09:34,600
And...

1563
01:09:34,633 --> 01:09:36,333
Fade.

1564
01:09:37,633 --> 01:09:38,933
Terrific show,
Stuart.

1565
01:09:38,967 --> 01:09:40,433
Oh, thank you,
Andy.

1566
01:09:40,467 --> 01:09:41,933
It's great
to have you back.

1567
01:09:41,967 --> 01:09:43,133
Oh. Ha ha!

1568
01:09:43,167 --> 01:09:44,600
It was--

1569
01:09:44,633 --> 01:09:46,067
oh! Wonderful.

1570
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:48,067
Did you really
like it?

1571
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:49,767
It was great.

1572
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:51,100
What was your
favorite part?

1573
01:09:51,133 --> 01:09:52,933
All of it.
I have to go to work.

1574
01:09:52,967 --> 01:09:54,033
I know. Go!

1575
01:09:54,067 --> 01:09:55,100
Congratulations.

1576
01:09:55,133 --> 01:09:56,967
Thank you.
You, too. Go.

1577
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,967
Oh, did you like
the slipper th--

1578
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,267
go, go!

1579
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:01,600
Stuart! Phone.

1580
01:10:01,633 --> 01:10:03,600
Oh, thank you.

1581
01:10:03,633 --> 01:10:05,100
Thanks.

1582
01:10:05,133 --> 01:10:06,600
Stuart smalley.

1583
01:10:06,633 --> 01:10:09,067
Dad shot Donnie!
Dad shot Donnie!

1584
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:10,167
Jodie?

1585
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:12,033
Wh-where did
dad shot Donnie?

1586
01:10:12,067 --> 01:10:14,000
In the side!
In the side!

1587
01:10:14,033 --> 01:10:15,533
I mean where--
in the house?

1588
01:10:15,567 --> 01:10:17,033
In the side!
In the side!

1589
01:10:17,067 --> 01:10:18,233
How?

1590
01:10:18,267 --> 01:10:20,067
With his deer rifle!

1591
01:10:20,100 --> 01:10:21,767
Was there
an argument?
What happened?

1592
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:24,333
No! Dad shot Donnie!

1593
01:10:24,367 --> 01:10:26,033
I mean, is he--

1594
01:10:26,067 --> 01:10:27,867
is he going to live?

1595
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:30,233
I don't know. I...

1596
01:10:30,267 --> 01:10:32,500
Dad sh him!
I mean, he shot him!

1597
01:10:32,533 --> 01:10:35,033
O.k., Jodie, look.

1598
01:10:35,067 --> 01:10:37,033
I would never
ordinarily say this,

1599
01:10:37,067 --> 01:10:38,533
but, um...

1600
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:40,033
Is there any way
you can get

1601
01:10:40,067 --> 01:10:41,400
to a pound cake?

1602
01:10:41,433 --> 01:10:43,700
I couldn't get Jodie
to calm down,

1603
01:10:43,733 --> 01:10:46,800
and this is a person
who lives for crises,

1604
01:10:46,833 --> 01:10:50,900
so I called the hospital
and asked for Donnie's room,

1605
01:10:50,933 --> 01:10:53,400
and the phone rang,
and Donnie picked it up,

1606
01:10:53,433 --> 01:10:56,400
and he told me
what happened.

1607
01:10:56,433 --> 01:10:59,400
He and dad were
up near braniard deer hunting,

1608
01:10:59,433 --> 01:11:01,533
and of course,
they were drinking...

1609
01:11:01,567 --> 01:11:03,300
A lot.

1610
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,967
Well, eventually
they ran out of beer,

1611
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,100
so Donnie went off
to buy some.

1612
01:11:12,933 --> 01:11:16,200
I guess he was gone
for quite a while,

1613
01:11:16,233 --> 01:11:17,900
and dad lost all track of time.

1614
01:11:17,933 --> 01:11:19,967
He probably lost
all track of everything,

1615
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
he was so drunk.

1616
01:11:23,933 --> 01:11:26,667
Anyway, when Donnie
finally came back

1617
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:28,400
with the case of beer,

1618
01:11:28,433 --> 01:11:30,267
dad heard him stumbling
around in the woods,

1619
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:33,233
thought Donnie was a deer,

1620
01:11:33,267 --> 01:11:34,500
and...

1621
01:11:34,533 --> 01:11:36,900
Shot him.

1622
01:11:36,933 --> 01:11:39,167
[Gunshot]

1623
01:11:45,067 --> 01:11:46,767
Hi, mom.

1624
01:11:50,567 --> 01:11:52,033
Are you o.K.?

1625
01:11:52,067 --> 01:11:53,767
No.

1626
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:56,533
Is--is dad coming out?

1627
01:11:56,567 --> 01:11:58,000
I don't know,

1628
01:11:58,033 --> 01:11:59,767
and I don't care.

1629
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:03,867
Oh, hi, dad.

1630
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:05,600
Um, is...

1631
01:12:05,633 --> 01:12:08,333
Is Donnie o.K.?

1632
01:12:11,067 --> 01:12:12,933
I'll get the car.

1633
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:16,033
O.k. See you
for dinner.

1634
01:12:16,067 --> 01:12:18,133
I'm sure mom's
cooking up a storm.

1635
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:20,700
Now, what is that
supposed to mean?

1636
01:12:20,733 --> 01:12:22,200
Uh, nothing.

1637
01:12:22,233 --> 01:12:24,033
I just know how much
you like to cook.

1638
01:12:24,067 --> 01:12:25,533
Mm-hmm.

1639
01:12:25,567 --> 01:12:26,867
You know, especially
in a crisis.

1640
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:28,567
Are you crazy?

1641
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:30,333
I didn't mean it
critically, mom.

1642
01:12:30,367 --> 01:12:32,033
If this is what
they teach you

1643
01:12:32,067 --> 01:12:34,800
in those 12-step
or 13-step or 14
or whatever...

1644
01:12:34,833 --> 01:12:36,033
It's 12.

1645
01:12:36,067 --> 01:12:37,633
12 steps.

1646
01:12:37,667 --> 01:12:41,033
Well, I don't know
how I'm supposed
to keep track.

1647
01:12:41,067 --> 01:12:43,033
This may come
as a shock to you,

1648
01:12:43,067 --> 01:12:46,033
but I have not had
the easiest life.

1649
01:12:46,067 --> 01:12:47,533
I know
that you think

1650
01:12:47,567 --> 01:12:49,033
when I'm working
around the house,

1651
01:12:49,067 --> 01:12:51,567
cooking and cleaning
and breaking
my back,

1652
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:54,000
that I do it
because it's fun.

1653
01:12:54,033 --> 01:12:56,533
Well, it is not fun!

1654
01:12:56,567 --> 01:12:59,033
It is not fun

1655
01:12:59,067 --> 01:13:01,367
for one single
minute!

1656
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:09,533
Well, at least mom
was beginning to get

1657
01:13:09,567 --> 01:13:12,267
in touch with her feelings.

1658
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:22,867
Hi--hi, Donnie.

1659
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:24,433
Hey, bro.

1660
01:13:25,333 --> 01:13:27,667
Uh, I brought
some...

1661
01:13:27,700 --> 01:13:29,767
Magazines.

1662
01:13:32,567 --> 01:13:34,533
Well, you look good.

1663
01:13:34,567 --> 01:13:36,033
No, really.

1664
01:13:36,067 --> 01:13:37,533
It's, you know,

1665
01:13:37,567 --> 01:13:39,033
hard to believe
you were shot.

1666
01:13:39,067 --> 01:13:40,533
Ha ha!
Well, I'm o.K.

1667
01:13:40,567 --> 01:13:42,533
Yeah?

1668
01:13:42,567 --> 01:13:45,033
Did you see dad
in the hall?

1669
01:13:45,067 --> 01:13:46,767
Yeah.

1670
01:13:48,067 --> 01:13:50,033
Well, dad's got
a real problem.

1671
01:13:50,067 --> 01:13:51,967
Ha ha! You think?

1672
01:13:53,567 --> 01:13:55,533
He just tried to sneak me

1673
01:13:55,567 --> 01:13:57,767
a half pint
of Jack Daniel's...

1674
01:14:00,133 --> 01:14:02,333
And when I said no...

1675
01:14:04,633 --> 01:14:07,000
He went nuts.

1676
01:14:08,533 --> 01:14:10,100
You know, i--i think

1677
01:14:10,133 --> 01:14:13,267
that this accident
was supposed to happen.

1678
01:14:15,067 --> 01:14:18,767
I needed something
to scare the shit
out of me.

1679
01:14:22,067 --> 01:14:24,600
I'm not drinking anymore.

1680
01:14:25,733 --> 01:14:28,667
Yeah. No drinking
and no drugs.

1681
01:14:31,067 --> 01:14:33,267
[Groaning]

1682
01:14:35,067 --> 01:14:36,767
O.k.?

1683
01:14:38,067 --> 01:14:42,033
I'm sorry I've been
such a lousy brother.

1684
01:14:42,067 --> 01:14:43,433
The worst.

1685
01:14:43,467 --> 01:14:45,267
Ha ha!

1686
01:14:48,567 --> 01:14:52,000
Over the years,
I've always picked on you...

1687
01:14:53,533 --> 01:14:56,100
Which is a pretty
easy thing to do.
You're such a dork.

1688
01:14:56,133 --> 01:14:57,933
Thank you.

1689
01:14:59,133 --> 01:15:01,967
But I think a lot of it
was because I was jealous.

1690
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,033
Of me?

1691
01:15:04,067 --> 01:15:07,100
You were always
trying to do something
with your life,

1692
01:15:07,133 --> 01:15:11,267
and I thought
I was tough, man...

1693
01:15:14,567 --> 01:15:16,533
And you're the tough one.

1694
01:15:22,067 --> 01:15:23,533
Oh!

1695
01:15:23,567 --> 01:15:25,967
We've got to do
something about dad.

1696
01:15:26,867 --> 01:15:28,533
You want me
to shoot him?

1697
01:15:28,567 --> 01:15:30,300
Because it worked
for you.

1698
01:15:31,567 --> 01:15:33,267
I don't know.

1699
01:15:35,067 --> 01:15:37,267
But we've got
to do something.

1700
01:15:40,067 --> 01:15:41,533
[Man]
Mrs. Smalley,
your children

1701
01:15:41,567 --> 01:15:43,533
plan
to go ahead with
this intervention,

1702
01:15:43,567 --> 01:15:45,700
whether or not
you choose to
participate.

1703
01:15:47,067 --> 01:15:49,033
It would really
help, mom.

1704
01:15:49,067 --> 01:15:51,100
It could make
all the difference.

1705
01:15:54,067 --> 01:15:56,300
What happens afterwards?

1706
01:15:56,333 --> 01:15:58,300
I've called a friend
at hazelton.

1707
01:15:58,333 --> 01:16:02,100
It's a rehab.
They've got a bed
waiting for him.

1708
01:16:03,133 --> 01:16:05,600
Well, i--I'm not
so convinced

1709
01:16:05,633 --> 01:16:07,333
he's an alcoholic.

1710
01:16:07,367 --> 01:16:09,100
Mom.

1711
01:16:09,133 --> 01:16:10,600
Mrs. Smalley,
does your husband

1712
01:16:10,633 --> 01:16:12,233
ever drink
in the morning?

1713
01:16:14,067 --> 01:16:16,200
This is one
of those tests.

1714
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:21,033
Yes, he drinks
in the morning.

1715
01:16:21,067 --> 01:16:22,533
Does he ever
drink alone?

1716
01:16:26,567 --> 01:16:28,267
Yes.

1717
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,467
Has he ever--

1718
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:33,033
shot a family member
while drinking?

1719
01:16:33,067 --> 01:16:34,600
Yes.

1720
01:16:39,567 --> 01:16:41,533
If I do this

1721
01:16:41,567 --> 01:16:43,533
and it doesn't work,

1722
01:16:43,567 --> 01:16:45,733
he's going to
make my life hell.

1723
01:16:45,767 --> 01:16:47,900
How's your life now?

1724
01:16:59,767 --> 01:17:02,700
This could work.

1725
01:17:07,133 --> 01:17:09,600
Is there
anyone else--
any friends of his

1726
01:17:09,633 --> 01:17:12,033
who might
be willing
to participate?

1727
01:17:12,067 --> 01:17:15,033
Um...

1728
01:17:15,067 --> 01:17:19,267
Uh, dad doesn't have
any friends who would do this.

1729
01:17:22,067 --> 01:17:25,033
Uh, the truth is,
I'm his best friend.

1730
01:17:25,067 --> 01:17:27,533
Donnie,
if he refuses
to stop drinking,

1731
01:17:27,567 --> 01:17:29,633
what are you
willing to do?

1732
01:17:29,667 --> 01:17:32,033
Are you willing
to tell your father

1733
01:17:32,067 --> 01:17:34,500
that you will
completely cut off

1734
01:17:34,533 --> 01:17:36,733
your relationship
with him?

1735
01:17:39,567 --> 01:17:42,333
Yeah. Yeah,
I'll tell him.

1736
01:17:42,367 --> 01:17:44,400
Don't if you don't
mean it.

1737
01:17:44,433 --> 01:17:45,900
I don't want you
to threaten anything

1738
01:17:45,933 --> 01:17:48,000
you're not willing
to follow through
with.

1739
01:17:49,567 --> 01:17:52,167
I'll say it.
I'll mean it.

1740
01:18:01,133 --> 01:18:02,833
Me, too.

1741
01:18:05,633 --> 01:18:08,433
Oh, god.

1742
01:18:08,467 --> 01:18:10,167
O.k.

1743
01:18:14,633 --> 01:18:16,267
Mrs. Smalley?

1744
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:18,600
You want this
to work?

1745
01:18:18,633 --> 01:18:20,100
Just...

1746
01:18:20,133 --> 01:18:22,433
I just can't.

1747
01:18:22,467 --> 01:18:24,433
What can you
tell him?

1748
01:18:27,133 --> 01:18:28,833
Well...

1749
01:18:32,133 --> 01:18:36,100
I'll tell him
I'll spend less time
taking care of him

1750
01:18:36,133 --> 01:18:40,400
and more time pursuing
my own interests.

1751
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:42,767
Ha ha ha!

1752
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:44,100
Ha ha!

1753
01:18:44,133 --> 01:18:45,500
Ha ha!

1754
01:18:52,267 --> 01:18:54,100
Ha ha ha!

1755
01:18:54,133 --> 01:18:57,600
Ha ha! "Pursuing
my own interests."

1756
01:18:57,633 --> 01:19:00,667
Ha ha ha!

1757
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:02,500
That ought
to clinch it.

1758
01:19:02,533 --> 01:19:05,167
Ha ha ha!

1759
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:08,100
You know, it hurts
when I laugh.
Ha ha ha!

1760
01:19:11,767 --> 01:19:14,467
The intervention is tomorrow.

1761
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:16,467
Each of US is supposed
to tell dad

1762
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:19,033
how his drinking
has affected US

1763
01:19:19,067 --> 01:19:21,300
and how it made US feel,

1764
01:19:21,333 --> 01:19:23,367
but looking
through the old photos,

1765
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:24,867
I started thinking,

1766
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:26,467
"things weren't so bad.

1767
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:28,967
They did
the best they could."

1768
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:32,967
But then I found some pictures
I thought mom had thrown out.

1769
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:37,067
They were pictures of US
in Hollywood.

1770
01:19:37,100 --> 01:19:39,967
It was our big trip
to Los Angeles--

1771
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,967
Disneyland,
the whole bit.

1772
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,033
Well, dad got loaded
the last night,

1773
01:19:44,067 --> 01:19:45,633
and by the time we got him up,

1774
01:19:45,667 --> 01:19:47,700
we had about an hour
to see Hollywood.

1775
01:19:47,733 --> 01:19:49,767
Go, go, go!

1776
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:52,033
Dad! Dad!
Bob hope!

1777
01:19:52,067 --> 01:19:54,533
Natalie wood!

1778
01:19:54,567 --> 01:19:56,967
Mom! Doris day!

1779
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,967
Mom!
Marilyn Monroe!

1780
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,700
Dad! Sophia loren!
Hubba-hubba!

1781
01:20:01,733 --> 01:20:03,800
Come on!
Let's go!

1782
01:20:03,833 --> 01:20:05,067
Now, before the trip,

1783
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:06,333
dad had promised Jodie

1784
01:20:06,367 --> 01:20:07,967
he'd take a picture of her

1785
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,567
standing in front
of the Hollywood sign.

1786
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:11,967
Oh, god!

1787
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,500
Ah!

1788
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:19,400
Our plane's
in 35 minutes!

1789
01:20:19,433 --> 01:20:22,800
It's o.K., dad!
I don't need
the picture!

1790
01:20:22,833 --> 01:20:23,967
Oh, no.

1791
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,900
I'm not having mom say,

1792
01:20:25,933 --> 01:20:27,900
"Jodie didn't get
her picture

1793
01:20:27,933 --> 01:20:30,767
because we couldn't
get you up!"

1794
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,767
[Tires screech]

1795
01:20:35,567 --> 01:20:37,400
Ah, perfect.

1796
01:20:37,433 --> 01:20:38,900
All right.
Let's go.

1797
01:20:38,933 --> 01:20:40,967
Out of the car.
Come on. Camera.

1798
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,967
Hurry up. Hurry up.

1799
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,467
Come on.

1800
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:46,467
All right.

1801
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:48,067
Ah, that's good.

1802
01:20:48,100 --> 01:20:49,533
Where's the sign?

1803
01:20:49,567 --> 01:20:50,500
Ah.

1804
01:20:50,533 --> 01:20:52,433
Where's
the goddamn sign?

1805
01:20:52,467 --> 01:20:53,833
Get it.

1806
01:20:53,867 --> 01:20:55,233
Get out there!

1807
01:20:55,267 --> 01:20:56,667
But there are cars!

1808
01:20:56,700 --> 01:20:58,467
Move out
into the center
of the road,

1809
01:20:58,500 --> 01:20:59,967
goddamn it!

1810
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,433
O.k.

1811
01:21:01,467 --> 01:21:02,600
Oh, my god!
There's a car!

1812
01:21:02,633 --> 01:21:05,167
[Horn honks]

1813
01:21:07,067 --> 01:21:09,533
Asshole!

1814
01:21:09,567 --> 01:21:11,400
This is insane!

1815
01:21:11,433 --> 01:21:12,767
What the hell are you
doing over there?

1816
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:14,267
[Dad]
Come back.

1817
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:16,033
No! No! Go back!
Go back!

1818
01:21:16,067 --> 01:21:18,467
Right there.
Jodie.

1819
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:21,400
A little
closer to Stuart,
sweetheart.

1820
01:21:21,433 --> 01:21:23,133
That's right.
Yes. Uh-huh.

1821
01:21:23,167 --> 01:21:25,300
Good. Oh,
that's good.

1822
01:21:25,333 --> 01:21:27,233
Look happy!

1823
01:21:27,267 --> 01:21:28,467
All right!

1824
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:29,967
Aah!

1825
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,467
Ah, goddamn it!

1826
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:32,867
Find another road!

1827
01:21:32,900 --> 01:21:34,400
Stop it,
you maniac!

1828
01:21:34,433 --> 01:21:36,467
Jerk.
Come back!

1829
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:37,967
No!

1830
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:38,967
Oh, my god!

1831
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,833
Everybody smile!

1832
01:21:42,733 --> 01:21:44,700
Aah!
Aah!

1833
01:21:44,733 --> 01:21:46,200
Aah!

1834
01:21:46,233 --> 01:21:47,800
Cheese!

1835
01:21:51,433 --> 01:21:53,300
The doctors
in the emergency room

1836
01:21:53,333 --> 01:21:54,767
said if I wasn't so fat,

1837
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:56,333
I would have really
gotten hurt.

1838
01:21:56,367 --> 01:21:57,667
The weird thing is,

1839
01:21:57,700 --> 01:21:59,167
we've never talked
about it since.

1840
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:00,967
In fact,
I think that's when

1841
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,967
the no-talk rule
began in our house,

1842
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,033
but at 10 A.M. tomorrow,

1843
01:22:06,067 --> 01:22:08,100
all that will change.

1844
01:22:08,133 --> 01:22:09,600
This guy's
a good lawyer?

1845
01:22:09,633 --> 01:22:11,100
Yeah.

1846
01:22:11,133 --> 01:22:13,033
Says he can keep me
out of jail, huh?

1847
01:22:13,067 --> 01:22:15,300
Yeah. If you do
what he says, yeah.

1848
01:22:25,300 --> 01:22:26,633
Mr. Smalley.

1849
01:22:26,667 --> 01:22:28,133
Your family
has asked me

1850
01:22:28,167 --> 01:22:29,533
to help them

1851
01:22:29,567 --> 01:22:31,533
because
of some concerns
they have about you.

1852
01:22:31,567 --> 01:22:33,033
They have
some things

1853
01:22:33,067 --> 01:22:35,033
that they'd like
to say to you,

1854
01:22:35,067 --> 01:22:37,033
and I'm going to
ask you

1855
01:22:37,067 --> 01:22:39,067
just to sit
and listen,

1856
01:22:39,100 --> 01:22:40,867
hear them out,
and then--

1857
01:22:40,900 --> 01:22:42,533
then we'll give you
a chance to talk.

1858
01:22:42,567 --> 01:22:44,033
Can you agree
to that?

1859
01:22:44,067 --> 01:22:45,533
Who the hell are you?

1860
01:22:45,567 --> 01:22:48,033
Mr. Smalley, I can
understand this is
real uncomfortable--

1861
01:22:48,067 --> 01:22:49,533
who did this?

1862
01:22:49,567 --> 01:22:51,033
Oh, oh. You, huh?

1863
01:22:51,067 --> 01:22:52,367
Uh, Mr. Smalley,

1864
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:53,700
your whole family
is concerned.

1865
01:22:53,733 --> 01:22:55,033
You know
about this guy?

1866
01:22:55,067 --> 01:22:58,033
I hope somebody
has told you
the whole story.

1867
01:22:58,067 --> 01:23:00,833
Why don't you just
sit down right here, hmm?

1868
01:23:02,133 --> 01:23:03,833
That's right.

1869
01:23:05,133 --> 01:23:06,667
Jodie,

1870
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:08,833
you have something
to say to your father?

1871
01:23:16,067 --> 01:23:19,433
You were drunk
at all my weddings.

1872
01:23:19,467 --> 01:23:21,533
[Jodie sobbing]

1873
01:23:21,567 --> 01:23:24,033
Did you get to meet
her ex-husbands?

1874
01:23:24,067 --> 01:23:27,033
Dopey, drunky,
and shithead.

1875
01:23:27,067 --> 01:23:28,533
[Man]
You agreed to listen.

1876
01:23:28,567 --> 01:23:30,033
I didn't agree
to anything.

1877
01:23:30,067 --> 01:23:32,033
At least I stayed
with my ungrateful family

1878
01:23:32,067 --> 01:23:34,033
and provided for you.

1879
01:23:34,067 --> 01:23:36,533
None of you went hungry.

1880
01:23:36,567 --> 01:23:38,733
That's painfully obvious.

1881
01:23:38,767 --> 01:23:40,400
[Man]
Mr. Smalley.

1882
01:23:40,433 --> 01:23:42,767
A man might stay with you
if you weren't so damn fat.

1883
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:43,900
Jesus!

1884
01:23:43,933 --> 01:23:45,900
What? I'm
under attack here.

1885
01:23:45,933 --> 01:23:47,733
It wasn't my fault.

1886
01:23:47,767 --> 01:23:49,067
You're an asshole!

1887
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:50,833
Well, you want
a piece of me?

1888
01:23:50,867 --> 01:23:51,833
Yeah.

1889
01:23:51,867 --> 01:23:53,433
Come on!

1890
01:23:53,467 --> 01:23:55,033
Mr. Smalley, please.

1891
01:23:55,067 --> 01:23:56,600
Ha ha ha!

1892
01:23:56,633 --> 01:23:58,533
Unbelievable.

1893
01:23:58,567 --> 01:24:00,333
Sit down...Please.

1894
01:24:07,133 --> 01:24:08,533
Stuart,

1895
01:24:08,567 --> 01:24:10,333
do you have
something to say?

1896
01:24:12,567 --> 01:24:14,533
Dad...

1897
01:24:14,567 --> 01:24:16,033
There were a lot
of instances

1898
01:24:16,067 --> 01:24:17,533
in my childhood

1899
01:24:17,567 --> 01:24:20,100
when your drinking
made me feel bad,

1900
01:24:20,133 --> 01:24:21,700
but this is now,

1901
01:24:21,733 --> 01:24:24,033
and I want to talk
about now.

1902
01:24:24,067 --> 01:24:26,033
I have changed a lot

1903
01:24:26,067 --> 01:24:28,033
in the last
three years.

1904
01:24:28,067 --> 01:24:33,033
I mean, I lost
127 pounds,

1905
01:24:33,067 --> 01:24:34,533
and...

1906
01:24:34,567 --> 01:24:36,967
I don't think
you even noticed.

1907
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,267
But more than that,

1908
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:41,767
I've made a lot
of progress
as a person...

1909
01:24:43,067 --> 01:24:45,033
And it hurts me...

1910
01:24:45,067 --> 01:24:46,533
That...

1911
01:24:46,567 --> 01:24:48,033
[Sigh]

1912
01:24:48,067 --> 01:24:49,533
You refuse to--

1913
01:24:49,567 --> 01:24:51,900
to even see that.

1914
01:24:51,933 --> 01:24:56,533
Aw, it's o.K.,
Stuart.

1915
01:24:56,567 --> 01:24:58,533
I'm here for you.

1916
01:24:58,567 --> 01:25:00,100
Come on.

1917
01:25:00,133 --> 01:25:03,500
Why don't you give
your alcoholic dad
a big hug?

1918
01:25:03,533 --> 01:25:05,333
[Man]
Mr. Smalley.

1919
01:25:05,367 --> 01:25:06,833
Well, isn't that
what you do

1920
01:25:06,867 --> 01:25:08,333
in your 12-step
programs?

1921
01:25:08,367 --> 01:25:09,833
I always think

1922
01:25:09,867 --> 01:25:11,433
I should organize
one of these for you!

1923
01:25:11,467 --> 01:25:13,367
Because you're addicted.

1924
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:15,033
You're addicted...

1925
01:25:15,067 --> 01:25:17,033
To 12-step programs!

1926
01:25:17,067 --> 01:25:18,533
Ha ha ha!

1927
01:25:18,567 --> 01:25:20,033
God, you'd drink, too,

1928
01:25:20,067 --> 01:25:22,800
if you had liberace
for a son.

1929
01:25:22,833 --> 01:25:24,033
Dad!

1930
01:25:24,067 --> 01:25:26,033
We're both drunks!

1931
01:25:26,067 --> 01:25:28,533
And you know what?
You're dangerous!

1932
01:25:28,567 --> 01:25:30,667
The alcohol has made you
dangerous

1933
01:25:30,700 --> 01:25:32,533
to yourself
and to all of US!

1934
01:25:32,567 --> 01:25:34,067
You've scarred
all of US!

1935
01:25:34,100 --> 01:25:35,533
I mean, look at me!

1936
01:25:35,567 --> 01:25:37,067
I haven't done shit
with my life!

1937
01:25:37,100 --> 01:25:38,733
And that's all my fault?

1938
01:25:38,767 --> 01:25:40,700
No, it's not
all your fault,

1939
01:25:40,733 --> 01:25:42,700
but stuff happened...

1940
01:25:42,733 --> 01:25:44,767
That made it hard.

1941
01:25:46,567 --> 01:25:48,933
You remember
my first year at Kennedy?

1942
01:25:48,967 --> 01:25:51,600
New school,
new kids.

1943
01:25:51,633 --> 01:25:54,533
You know, I actually
got up the courage

1944
01:25:54,567 --> 01:25:56,033
to have a party.

1945
01:25:56,067 --> 01:25:58,033
Remember?
Down in the basement?

1946
01:25:58,067 --> 01:26:00,333
We were playing
records and stuff.

1947
01:26:01,633 --> 01:26:03,600
And you got so drunk,

1948
01:26:03,633 --> 01:26:06,400
you fell down the stairs
in front of everybody.

1949
01:26:11,567 --> 01:26:13,033
That just--

1950
01:26:13,067 --> 01:26:15,400
that just
never happened.

1951
01:26:15,433 --> 01:26:17,267
Huh!

1952
01:26:21,067 --> 01:26:22,400
Mrs. Smalley?

1953
01:26:26,567 --> 01:26:29,267
Maybe if you just
cut down a little...

1954
01:26:31,067 --> 01:26:33,267
After the holidays.

1955
01:26:40,067 --> 01:26:41,600
Jesus.

1956
01:26:41,633 --> 01:26:43,400
Why did we do this?

1957
01:26:45,567 --> 01:26:49,033
There is one more
piece of information,

1958
01:26:49,067 --> 01:26:51,267
Mr. Smalley.

1959
01:26:53,067 --> 01:26:54,533
This is a letter

1960
01:26:54,567 --> 01:26:57,033
from the district attorney
of hennepin county

1961
01:26:57,067 --> 01:27:00,600
regarding your
hunting accident.

1962
01:27:00,633 --> 01:27:03,933
It says if you don't
get help...

1963
01:27:04,833 --> 01:27:06,567
You go to jail.

1964
01:27:09,133 --> 01:27:11,100
Hmm. Oh.

1965
01:27:11,133 --> 01:27:14,533
If this is what
it's like in rehab,

1966
01:27:14,567 --> 01:27:17,267
send me to jail.

1967
01:27:19,067 --> 01:27:21,767
I'll talk to you
at home.

1968
01:27:34,567 --> 01:27:36,767
Well, that was fun.

1969
01:27:38,067 --> 01:27:39,933
[Sigh]

1970
01:27:42,933 --> 01:27:45,400
That night,
I had this dream.

1971
01:27:45,433 --> 01:27:49,133
It's a recurring dream
I've had most of my life.

1972
01:28:18,900 --> 01:28:22,033
I'm holding dad in my arms,
and he looks up at me.

1973
01:28:22,067 --> 01:28:24,167
His eyes just look into mine

1974
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:26,033
and seem to say,

1975
01:28:26,067 --> 01:28:27,533
"I'm sorry I'm so helpless.

1976
01:28:27,567 --> 01:28:29,733
"Thank you for saving me.

1977
01:28:29,767 --> 01:28:31,700
I love you."

1978
01:28:35,067 --> 01:28:38,500
And that's the end.

1979
01:28:40,633 --> 01:28:42,600
I can't take this.

1980
01:28:42,633 --> 01:28:44,100
You see, the thing is,

1981
01:28:44,133 --> 01:28:45,800
I have nothing
to spend it on.

1982
01:28:45,833 --> 01:28:48,100
You could spend it
on yourself.

1983
01:28:48,133 --> 01:28:50,600
No, I can't. Actually,
that's one of my problems.

1984
01:28:50,633 --> 01:28:53,333
I'm an anorexic spender.

1985
01:28:53,367 --> 01:28:55,100
I'll pay you back.

1986
01:28:55,133 --> 01:28:56,833
Whenever.

1987
01:28:58,133 --> 01:29:00,700
They called your bus.

1988
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:03,667
Um...

1989
01:29:03,700 --> 01:29:07,667
I don't think
I'm coming back
for Christmas.

1990
01:29:07,700 --> 01:29:10,633
I have to get on
with my life.

1991
01:29:10,667 --> 01:29:12,600
Yeah.

1992
01:29:12,633 --> 01:29:14,600
It's going to be weird
not being home.

1993
01:29:14,633 --> 01:29:17,100
I'll miss the, uh...

1994
01:29:17,133 --> 01:29:18,767
Fighting, mainly.

1995
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:20,300
Yeah.

1996
01:29:20,333 --> 01:29:22,933
You guys going to
be o.K.?

1997
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:26,333
[Loudspeaker]
Final call.

1998
01:29:27,633 --> 01:29:29,600
Uh, take care of Kyle

1999
01:29:29,633 --> 01:29:31,100
and yourself.

2000
01:29:31,133 --> 01:29:33,033
You, too.

2001
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:41,600
Go to meetings.

2002
01:29:43,100 --> 01:29:45,433
You know where I am.

2003
01:29:55,300 --> 01:29:57,067
And get a sponsor.

2004
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:07,967
And the whole thing was
just a humongous disaster,

2005
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,533
and mom and dad
won't talk to me,

2006
01:30:10,567 --> 01:30:12,400
and I told Jodie and Donnie

2007
01:30:12,433 --> 01:30:14,900
that I just--
I won't be coming back,

2008
01:30:14,933 --> 01:30:17,967
which means I'll be
having Christmas

2009
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:21,533
without my family
for the first time ever,

2010
01:30:21,567 --> 01:30:23,533
and that's o.K.

2011
01:30:23,567 --> 01:30:25,600
Because I have
lots of friends,

2012
01:30:25,633 --> 01:30:27,533
and believe me,

2013
01:30:27,567 --> 01:30:29,533
we're going to celebrate

2014
01:30:29,567 --> 01:30:31,533
because when it comes
to partying,

2015
01:30:31,567 --> 01:30:33,533
no one gets down

2016
01:30:33,567 --> 01:30:35,233
like people in recovery.

2017
01:30:35,267 --> 01:30:37,267
It's true.

2018
01:30:38,433 --> 01:30:40,400
But still I know
it's going to be

2019
01:30:40,433 --> 01:30:42,467
a bumpy time for me
emotionally,

2020
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:43,967
and that's o.K.

2021
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:45,800
I have to accept that

2022
01:30:45,833 --> 01:30:48,900
because
as we say in program,

2023
01:30:48,933 --> 01:30:51,933
"alcoholism is
a threefold disease--

2024
01:30:51,967 --> 01:30:54,533
Thanksgiving, Christmas,
and new year's."

2025
01:30:54,567 --> 01:30:56,267
Isn't that clever?

2026
01:30:57,567 --> 01:31:01,100
Anyway, I guess I've finally
given up the fantasy

2027
01:31:01,133 --> 01:31:05,600
of the smalleys ever having
a Norman Rockwell Christmas--

2028
01:31:05,633 --> 01:31:09,600
or a Norman Rockwell anything,
for that matter--

2029
01:31:09,633 --> 01:31:12,033
and that's progress,

2030
01:31:12,067 --> 01:31:13,767
I guess.

2031
01:31:15,067 --> 01:31:17,033
And as we say,

2032
01:31:17,067 --> 01:31:18,533
"progress,

2033
01:31:18,567 --> 01:31:20,300
not perfection."

2034
01:31:23,967 --> 01:31:25,033
So...

2035
01:31:25,067 --> 01:31:27,033
Merry Christmas

2036
01:31:27,067 --> 01:31:29,033
and always remember

2037
01:31:29,067 --> 01:31:31,033
you're good enough,

2038
01:31:31,067 --> 01:31:32,533
you're smart enough,

2039
01:31:32,567 --> 01:31:34,033
and doggone it,

2040
01:31:34,067 --> 01:31:36,033
people like you.

2041
01:31:36,067 --> 01:31:38,033
[Man]
Clear.

2042
01:31:38,067 --> 01:31:39,533
O.k.!

2043
01:31:39,567 --> 01:31:41,033
Let's party!

2044
01:31:41,067 --> 01:31:42,533
[Cheering and applause]

2045
01:31:42,567 --> 01:31:44,267
[Music playing]

2046
01:31:45,567 --> 01:31:47,033
Merry Christmas,
Stuart.

2047
01:31:47,067 --> 01:31:49,267
Merry Christmas,
Stuart.

2048
01:31:51,567 --> 01:31:53,033
Jerry! Thank you
for coming.

2049
01:31:53,067 --> 01:31:55,033
So moving.
Merry Christmas!

2050
01:31:55,067 --> 01:31:56,333
Mea.

2051
01:31:56,367 --> 01:31:57,700
Merry Christmas.

2052
01:31:57,733 --> 01:31:59,033
I think
you're great.

2053
01:31:59,067 --> 01:32:00,600
Oh, I love you, too.

2054
01:32:00,633 --> 01:32:02,100
I think you're
just great.

2055
01:32:02,133 --> 01:32:03,600
I know.

2056
01:32:03,633 --> 01:32:05,600
O.k. That--that's good.

2057
01:32:05,633 --> 01:32:07,600
O.k. Merry--
merry Christmas.

2058
01:32:07,633 --> 01:32:09,100
Oh, I'm sorry.

2059
01:32:09,133 --> 01:32:10,733
That's--
that's o.K.

2060
01:32:10,767 --> 01:32:12,767
You two! Ha ha!

2061
01:32:14,067 --> 01:32:16,033
Oh! You didn't put that
on plastic, did you?

2062
01:32:16,067 --> 01:32:17,533
Oh, no. Cash only.

2063
01:32:17,567 --> 01:32:20,367
Sorry to take
your inventory.
Congratulations!

2064
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:22,267
Thank you.

2065
01:32:27,300 --> 01:32:29,533
Ah, can you
excuse me?

2066
01:32:29,567 --> 01:32:31,267
Sure.

2067
01:32:35,567 --> 01:32:37,033
That was a great show.

2068
01:32:37,067 --> 01:32:39,200
I'm so proud of you.

2069
01:32:40,567 --> 01:32:42,267
Thank you.

2070
01:32:43,567 --> 01:32:47,033
Um, about
Christmas dinner--

2071
01:32:47,067 --> 01:32:49,000
I'm going to have
to give you a rain check

2072
01:32:49,033 --> 01:32:51,767
because I'm going to Ohio.

2073
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:54,533
I called my family,
and I've reconciled with,

2074
01:32:54,567 --> 01:32:56,433
well, pretty much
all of them.

2075
01:32:56,467 --> 01:32:58,033
That's amazing.

2076
01:32:58,067 --> 01:32:59,567
It's a miracle.

2077
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:02,000
No. It's a joke.

2078
01:33:02,033 --> 01:33:04,433
Ha ha! Ha ha!

2079
01:33:04,467 --> 01:33:05,733
Oh...

2080
01:33:05,767 --> 01:33:07,867
We're going to have
a great Christmas.

2081
01:33:20,567 --> 01:33:22,867
The best ever.

2082
01:33:34,567 --> 01:33:37,633
Come on. I want you
to meet some of my friends.

2083
01:33:37,667 --> 01:33:39,367
O.k.

2084
01:33:42,067 --> 01:33:43,533
This is Julia.
She's my best friend.

2085
01:33:43,567 --> 01:33:45,033
This is my big brother.

2086
01:33:45,067 --> 01:33:46,533
Hi, Julie. Don.

2087
01:33:46,567 --> 01:33:48,567
Ha ha! Come on.
Let's meet everybody.

2088
01:33:48,600 --> 01:33:53,067
* grab your coat
and get your hat *

2093
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:14,400

01:34:14,433 --> 01:34:18,900

2106
01:35:03,633 --> 01:35:05,967
I was ugly and lonesome!
