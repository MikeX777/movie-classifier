2
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:16,535
We knew that they would come for us.

3
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:22,416
Like they always had before.

4
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:29,673
We tried to warn the others
that they would come for them too.

5
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:36,430
Because we knew how far they would go.

6
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:45,480
Four years ago, I was fasting in the bush.

7
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:54,656
I saw that a swarm of giant mosquitos
would be coming for us.

8
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,621
I also saw that a person, a guardian,

9
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:07,211
would come from the north to help us.

10
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:16,595
We heard stories about
this place called Bigstone.

11
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:22,559
We thought this person
could lead us there.

12
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:44,283
Why don't you kill it?

13
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:48,787
I was listening to it.

14
00:03:50,655 --> 00:03:52,791
All right, come on.

15
00:03:55,227 --> 00:03:56,561
It won't get us fed.

16
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:03,436
- Mum.
- Uh-huh?

17
00:04:03,502 --> 00:04:05,938
What's the main difference
between a vampire and a werewolf?

18
00:04:06,005 --> 00:04:08,274
I mean, aren't they
the same thing?

19
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,508
No, not really.

20
00:04:09,574 --> 00:04:12,777
I mean, they both
once were human

21
00:04:12,845 --> 00:04:17,983
and they're both affected
by sunlight and the moon.

22
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,853
I guess werewolves aren't
really affected by sunlight

23
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,455
but more so the moon.

24
00:04:22,521 --> 00:04:27,026
I think the main differences
actually, how they die.

25
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:34,233
- Waseese!
- Mom!

26
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,634
Get it off, get it off.

27
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:40,605
It's stuck, okay?

28
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:45,211
You're going to put up,
knee up. Knee up.

29
00:04:46,811 --> 00:04:48,948
One, two...

30
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:56,788
Let me look at it.

31
00:04:56,856 --> 00:04:59,724
It's going to be okay.

32
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:01,994
Hey, its gonna be okay.

33
00:05:03,863 --> 00:05:07,333
Let's get home. Okay. Ready?

34
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:09,667
It's gonna be okay, right?

35
00:05:09,734 --> 00:05:11,871
Come on, let's get going.

36
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:14,173
Ready, one two three.

37
00:05:18,911 --> 00:05:20,546
Ow.

38
00:06:35,888 --> 00:06:38,257
Waseese, keep quiet.

39
00:07:18,264 --> 00:07:19,898
Hey!

40
00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:45,357
More will come.

41
00:07:48,694 --> 00:07:50,162
Come on.

42
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:13,818
Mom, my leg hurts.

43
00:08:14,586 --> 00:08:16,422
We got to keep moving.

44
00:10:04,763 --> 00:10:07,332
No one can see your face.

45
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,634
No one.

46
00:10:26,151 --> 00:10:27,786
All Documents
must be up to date,

47
00:10:27,854 --> 00:10:30,722
including your child's birth
certificate, medical records,

48
00:10:30,789 --> 00:10:33,459
and personal access code.

49
00:10:33,525 --> 00:10:37,029
Possessing or concealing minors
over the legal age is a felony.

50
00:10:42,401 --> 00:10:46,638
Aiding those to possess or
conceal minors is also a felony.

51
00:10:46,705 --> 00:10:50,375
Report any suspicious
activity to the authorities.

52
00:10:52,744 --> 00:10:55,681
This is a reminder that
the Federal Academy's...

53
00:10:55,747 --> 00:10:57,483
Come on, let's go.

54
00:10:57,549 --> 00:10:59,351
...intake age has
changed to four years of age.

55
00:10:59,418 --> 00:11:02,488
Minors born on or before
September 2039

56
00:11:02,554 --> 00:11:06,458
must be reported to the
nearest Academy Intake Bureau.

57
00:11:06,525 --> 00:11:11,129
The nearest Bureau is located
at Jamestown Cathedral.

58
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,632
All Documents must
be up to date,

59
00:11:13,699 --> 00:11:15,902
including your child's
birth certificate,

60
00:11:15,969 --> 00:11:19,771
medical records,
and personal access code.

61
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,243
Possessing or concealing minors
over the legal age is a felony...

62
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:27,679
Who lives here?

63
00:11:28,547 --> 00:11:30,582
The city went dark
after the war.

64
00:11:34,219 --> 00:11:36,188
Some went to other side.

65
00:11:44,831 --> 00:11:47,000
Oh my goodness, oh my goodness.

66
00:11:47,065 --> 00:11:48,567
Is that a child?

67
00:11:48,634 --> 00:11:52,371
No, no. No, no. It's okay,
it's okay. Hold on.

68
00:11:53,438 --> 00:11:56,041
It's all right, Trey.
Come out. Come on out.

69
00:11:56,808 --> 00:11:58,076
See?

70
00:12:00,546 --> 00:12:02,314
I was beginning to
believe that my boy

71
00:12:02,381 --> 00:12:04,249
was the only free one left.

72
00:12:12,892 --> 00:12:14,693
We stick to ourselves.

73
00:14:00,033 --> 00:14:01,500
It's okay.

74
00:14:02,167 --> 00:14:03,702
It's been here for ages.

75
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,876
See?

76
00:14:09,942 --> 00:14:11,443
It's dead.

77
00:14:19,785 --> 00:14:20,920
Can you hear that?

78
00:14:22,721 --> 00:14:23,856
What do you mean?

79
00:14:23,923 --> 00:14:25,490
It's still breathing.

80
00:14:31,931 --> 00:14:33,099
Did it see you?!

81
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:35,567
- I don't know if it did!
- Dad! Dad!

82
00:14:37,837 --> 00:14:39,771
Go!

83
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,540
Dad!

84
00:14:41,606 --> 00:14:43,910
- Get in there.
- I'm coming!

85
00:14:44,977 --> 00:14:46,045
Dad!

86
00:14:49,781 --> 00:14:51,717
Hey.

87
00:14:51,783 --> 00:14:52,784
Freeze.

88
00:14:52,852 --> 00:14:54,319
Don't move!

89
00:14:55,922 --> 00:14:57,489
I'm eighteen!

90
00:14:57,556 --> 00:14:58,958
Don't move!

91
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:03,395
Sir, no.
My boy's eighteen.

92
00:15:03,462 --> 00:15:05,430
- Please, sir.
- No, sir.

93
00:15:05,497 --> 00:15:06,966
Give me your wrists.
Move!

94
00:15:14,907 --> 00:15:19,145
Fifteen! Sir, you are in
the unlawful possession

95
00:15:19,212 --> 00:15:22,414
of an unregistered minor,
official property of the State.

96
00:15:22,481 --> 00:15:23,916
- Please!
- Get down!

97
00:15:23,983 --> 00:15:26,018
No! Please don't
take my son. Please! No!

98
00:15:26,085 --> 00:15:27,519
Dad, help! Dad, help!

99
00:15:27,586 --> 00:15:28,820
- No, Trey!
- Get off!

100
00:15:28,888 --> 00:15:30,655
Trey! Remember
what I told you!

101
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:33,025
Listen to me, remember what
I told you! Please-my son.

102
00:15:34,626 --> 00:15:36,528
Stay Down!

103
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,669
Ah, I can't. It really hurts.

104
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:09,856
At the Federal Academy,

105
00:17:09,922 --> 00:17:12,892
your children receive
a world-class education.

106
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,693
Come on, hurry up!

107
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:16,896
The academy
will keep your children safe

108
00:17:16,963 --> 00:17:19,631
while the post-civil war
re-building efforts

109
00:17:19,698 --> 00:17:21,800
continue in your city.

110
00:17:22,467 --> 00:17:25,071
Hey. Come on. Let's go!

111
00:17:25,137 --> 00:17:27,974
The Federal Academy's
intake age has recently...

112
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,441
Watch your step!

113
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:31,244
...changed
to four years of age.

114
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:35,248
Please report minors to the
nearest Academy Intake Bureau.

115
00:17:35,314 --> 00:17:39,151
For your convenience, there
are five bureau's to serve you.

116
00:17:39,218 --> 00:17:41,087
Here, keep this on.

117
00:17:46,725 --> 00:17:50,129
Let's go, come on.
Come on, come on.

118
00:17:56,369 --> 00:17:59,238
The only
pathway to gain citizenship.

119
00:17:59,305 --> 00:18:03,475
Every child deserves
a chance at a brighter future.

120
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:06,212
I am an academy graduate.

121
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:09,849
- I am an academy graduate.
- That's Pierre.

122
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:11,483
Register your child today.

123
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:12,919
Who's that?

124
00:18:12,985 --> 00:18:13,853
Pierre.

125
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,388
I used
to look after him.

126
00:18:15,453 --> 00:18:17,589
At the Academies,
dreams do come true.

127
00:18:17,656 --> 00:18:20,425
And remember, it's the law!

128
00:18:22,228 --> 00:18:23,795
Get down! Get down!

129
00:18:23,863 --> 00:18:25,031
Get down!

130
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:36,175
Okay, let's go.

131
00:18:44,516 --> 00:18:46,118
Roberta...

132
00:18:47,887 --> 00:18:49,621
it's us.

133
00:18:49,688 --> 00:18:52,024
No! My lovelies?

134
00:18:59,198 --> 00:19:00,632
Hurry. Hurry.

135
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,979
Hmm.

136
00:19:14,646 --> 00:19:16,115
I can't believe it's you!

137
00:19:16,182 --> 00:19:17,950
It's good to see you.

138
00:19:18,951 --> 00:19:22,188
Hey, can I get a
better look at you?

139
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:29,128
Oh, my.

140
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:33,798
You're more beautiful
than in my dreams.

141
00:19:36,534 --> 00:19:38,838
This is Roberta.
She's an old friend.

142
00:19:38,904 --> 00:19:42,607
Yeah, I'm her
decrepit old friend.

143
00:19:44,676 --> 00:19:46,778
Here, let's sit you down, hey?

144
00:19:49,714 --> 00:19:52,084
You're good? Okay, hold on.

145
00:19:55,754 --> 00:19:57,957
There you go. Okay.

146
00:20:01,861 --> 00:20:05,563
Hey, do you remember me?
Just a little bit?

147
00:20:07,233 --> 00:20:10,302
You taught me to sing
to the bumblebees

148
00:20:10,369 --> 00:20:14,806
a long, long time ago
and I still do it.

149
00:20:15,941 --> 00:20:18,844
So I get this moment
to thank you, you know.

150
00:20:20,513 --> 00:20:21,914
Thank you.

151
00:20:23,615 --> 00:20:25,985
Hey, I know.

152
00:20:26,052 --> 00:20:27,685
Wait, okay.

153
00:20:30,523 --> 00:20:32,158
Oh! Here they are.

154
00:20:39,631 --> 00:20:43,169
Now open your hand, flat.

155
00:20:54,646 --> 00:20:56,614
Hey, Spooky!

156
00:20:56,681 --> 00:20:59,018
Oh, I love you.

157
00:21:01,554 --> 00:21:02,888
It's okay.

158
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:06,225
Spooky, look.

159
00:21:06,992 --> 00:21:09,228
Open wide, that's it.

160
00:21:17,303 --> 00:21:18,537
Can you hear her purr?

161
00:21:21,273 --> 00:21:23,675
My goodness,
she does like you a lot.

162
00:21:27,546 --> 00:21:29,115
Can you talk to her too?

163
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,222
You've been in the
bush all this time?

164
00:21:38,723 --> 00:21:41,659
How long has it been,
five years?

165
00:21:42,595 --> 00:21:45,030
- Six.
- Six?

166
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,301
Not easy,

167
00:21:49,368 --> 00:21:51,203
even for the bush lady.

168
00:21:53,372 --> 00:21:56,408
And what about our
little tracker?

169
00:21:56,475 --> 00:21:57,943
Her head's always in the clouds.

170
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:00,846
Huh, not a bad place to be.

171
00:22:01,813 --> 00:22:03,349
She needs medicine.

172
00:22:06,085 --> 00:22:09,288
They patrol all the clinics now.

173
00:22:09,355 --> 00:22:11,957
It will take weeks.

174
00:22:12,024 --> 00:22:14,493
Yeah, it's infected

175
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,228
and it's getting worse.

176
00:22:27,139 --> 00:22:30,176
I saw Pierre, up on the screen.

177
00:22:33,879 --> 00:22:37,149
Well, my boy's a pilot now.

178
00:22:40,752 --> 00:22:42,421
Where's that picture?

179
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:48,027
He sent me this picture
when he graduated.

180
00:23:02,141 --> 00:23:04,677
So the drones,
they deliver food now?

181
00:23:04,742 --> 00:23:07,012
Yeah, apparently
they're even A.I. now.

182
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:09,848
The munchos have their
own little brains.

183
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:14,086
But they're still
sent from Emerson?

184
00:23:14,153 --> 00:23:17,856
Yeah, they killed us in the war,

185
00:23:17,923 --> 00:23:22,194
now they say they want
to feed us, who knows?

186
00:23:28,667 --> 00:23:32,204
And you two,
where do you want to go?

187
00:23:33,439 --> 00:23:35,807
I don't know.

188
00:23:35,874 --> 00:23:37,443
Back out to the bush?

189
00:23:39,345 --> 00:23:41,046
You... you...

190
00:23:43,582 --> 00:23:46,485
You know, you could
send her to school.

191
00:23:46,552 --> 00:23:48,087
Get her citizenship.

192
00:23:49,655 --> 00:23:51,190
No.

193
00:23:51,257 --> 00:23:55,261
Pierre's having a really
good life in Emerson.

194
00:23:56,829 --> 00:23:58,163
Away from all of this shit.

195
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:00,833
Yeah, but you'll
never see him again.

196
00:24:07,673 --> 00:24:10,609
You looked after her

197
00:24:10,676 --> 00:24:12,511
when she needed her mother most.

198
00:24:16,882 --> 00:24:19,985
Do you really want
her to be stuck here?

199
00:24:21,786 --> 00:24:24,789
We have no way out, but not her.

200
00:24:27,693 --> 00:24:29,328
My son has it...

201
00:24:29,962 --> 00:24:31,830
Has so much more there

202
00:24:31,897 --> 00:24:33,966
than I could ever give him here.

203
00:24:35,901 --> 00:24:38,971
More than Waseese
could ever have here.

204
00:25:47,806 --> 00:25:51,143
Hey! Hey,
watch that one over there!

205
00:25:57,416 --> 00:25:59,118
Jingoes.

206
00:26:02,821 --> 00:26:04,156
They're gonna check everywhere.

207
00:26:04,223 --> 00:26:05,224
Where can we hide?

208
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:06,959
You can't be found with her!

209
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,695
Mom?

210
00:26:09,762 --> 00:26:10,963
How do we get out?

211
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:13,298
She's calling you,
she's calling!

212
00:26:13,365 --> 00:26:16,902
- Ah! It hurts.
- Come on.

213
00:26:19,438 --> 00:26:21,974
Come, come, come, come.
Here, come on.

214
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:26,145
- She's burning up.
- No! You can't move her.

215
00:26:37,489 --> 00:26:38,924
No...

216
00:26:48,233 --> 00:26:51,303
- Will they help her?
- Yes. Yes. Yes.

217
00:26:55,107 --> 00:26:56,675
It's all right.

218
00:26:56,742 --> 00:26:58,243
It'll be okay.

219
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:07,619
I'm going to get
you some medicine.

220
00:27:10,956 --> 00:27:12,991
I'll be right back, okay?

221
00:27:25,304 --> 00:27:27,372
This will be better for her.

222
00:27:29,843 --> 00:27:33,312
There's a minor in the shop,
up there and she's sick.

223
00:27:33,378 --> 00:27:35,247
Minor! You're with me!

224
00:29:43,108 --> 00:29:45,377
- Morning, Lorna.
- Morning.

225
00:30:07,432 --> 00:30:09,534
Enter to win
the citizenship lottery.

226
00:30:09,601 --> 00:30:12,738
You could win a passport
to the shining capital

227
00:30:12,804 --> 00:30:14,239
of Emerson State,

228
00:30:14,306 --> 00:30:17,076
where peace
and prosperity reign.

229
00:30:17,142 --> 00:30:19,444
Don't miss you chance,
sign up today.

230
00:30:19,511 --> 00:30:22,247
That's what I did.

231
00:30:22,314 --> 00:30:25,217
You know, I was...
"What is he talking about?"

232
00:30:25,283 --> 00:30:27,786
Anyhow.

233
00:30:27,854 --> 00:30:30,056
What have you been up to?
Like, what did I miss?

234
00:30:30,123 --> 00:30:31,823
Other than this, nothing.

235
00:30:32,724 --> 00:30:34,726
Nothing?

236
00:30:34,793 --> 00:30:36,194
Did you miss me?

237
00:30:36,261 --> 00:30:38,397
Even just a little bit?

238
00:30:39,098 --> 00:30:40,699
Hey, check this.

239
00:30:42,734 --> 00:30:44,336
Look at this.

240
00:30:44,403 --> 00:30:45,905
You like that?

241
00:30:45,972 --> 00:30:47,739
Caribou horns.

242
00:30:50,575 --> 00:30:51,878
I should probably get going.

243
00:30:51,944 --> 00:30:54,813
Um, listen, I got
something to tell you.

244
00:30:56,615 --> 00:31:00,485
You know that old guy
I was telling you about?

245
00:31:00,552 --> 00:31:03,722
Well, he like, knows all
kinds of shit, right?

246
00:31:03,789 --> 00:31:05,223
And...

247
00:31:06,224 --> 00:31:08,027
he hooked me up...

248
00:31:08,094 --> 00:31:10,096
He hooked us up.

249
00:31:10,163 --> 00:31:12,798
And it's huge.

250
00:31:13,833 --> 00:31:15,300
What is?

251
00:31:18,704 --> 00:31:23,176
Why don't you meet me
tomorrow at the Zoo

252
00:31:23,241 --> 00:31:24,944
and I'll tell you about it.

253
00:31:26,745 --> 00:31:29,514
Come on. Come on!

254
00:31:29,581 --> 00:31:31,717
What else you got going, huh?

255
00:33:56,062 --> 00:33:57,562
You shut up!

256
00:34:01,499 --> 00:34:02,734
What's their problem now?

257
00:34:02,801 --> 00:34:05,704
Oh, some terrorist
cell in there.

258
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:10,142
They got a tip about these guys
who attacked the Academies.

259
00:34:10,209 --> 00:34:11,143
Supposedly.

260
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:12,945
For what?

261
00:34:13,012 --> 00:34:14,379
I dunno.

262
00:34:14,446 --> 00:34:16,082
Child trafficking?

263
00:34:30,263 --> 00:34:31,563
Hut.

264
00:34:39,238 --> 00:34:40,505
Attention.

265
00:34:49,181 --> 00:34:52,751
Selection day
is one week away.

266
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:56,788
If you want to be chosen

267
00:34:56,856 --> 00:35:02,427
as the one to transfer our most
elite academy in Emerson State,

268
00:35:03,195 --> 00:35:05,730
you must work for it.

269
00:35:06,999 --> 00:35:10,036
Victoria, please
lead the pledge.

270
00:35:17,176 --> 00:35:20,612
We pledge our hearts
and give our allegiance

271
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:22,415
to our glorious Republic.

272
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:27,485
We praise the great southern
nation for emancipating us

273
00:35:27,552 --> 00:35:30,156
and solemnly swear
to protect it,

274
00:35:30,222 --> 00:35:32,457
in the name of God,

275
00:35:32,524 --> 00:35:34,726
our liberty and freedom.

276
00:35:35,694 --> 00:35:37,495
One country,

277
00:35:37,562 --> 00:35:40,465
one language, one flag.

278
00:36:02,487 --> 00:36:04,589
You look beautiful.

279
00:36:04,656 --> 00:36:06,425
You ready to celebrate?

280
00:36:06,491 --> 00:36:08,626
I'm feeling kinda tired tonight.

281
00:36:08,693 --> 00:36:11,596
I know. I know you are.

282
00:36:12,865 --> 00:36:15,734
It's because you're in
this shitty shithole

283
00:36:16,634 --> 00:36:19,571
and you gotta get out, so do I.

284
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:24,809
I was thinking
we'd go to Emerson.

285
00:36:27,413 --> 00:36:29,115
That sounds fun.

286
00:36:29,181 --> 00:36:30,282
No, I'm serious.

287
00:36:31,984 --> 00:36:34,619
Remember that old guy
I told you about?

288
00:36:35,687 --> 00:36:37,256
Well, he hooked me up.

289
00:36:38,757 --> 00:36:42,928
I mean, he hooked me up
with citizenship.

290
00:36:42,995 --> 00:36:44,930
What? How?

291
00:36:56,674 --> 00:36:59,111
My ID is being re-programmed
right now okay?

292
00:36:59,178 --> 00:37:02,248
And so is yours,
I paid for it, Okay?

293
00:37:02,314 --> 00:37:04,216
In four days,
we are gonna be legit

294
00:37:04,283 --> 00:37:06,252
as fucking shit status citizens.

295
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:09,422
Can you fucking believe it?

296
00:37:09,488 --> 00:37:12,258
You can have anything you
want over there, anything!

297
00:37:12,324 --> 00:37:15,161
Yeah, but wouldn't we have
to live with those assholes?

298
00:37:15,895 --> 00:37:18,831
Yeah, and who gives a shit?

299
00:37:19,664 --> 00:37:21,033
You said you had a kid right?

300
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,635
You can be with her
when she graduates.

301
00:37:26,172 --> 00:37:27,772
Why not?

302
00:37:32,211 --> 00:37:33,578
Are you serious?

303
00:37:36,549 --> 00:37:38,084
Yeah.

304
00:38:16,355 --> 00:38:18,524
Well at least
I don't have to sleep

305
00:38:18,591 --> 00:38:20,259
next to bush girl.

306
00:38:20,326 --> 00:38:22,561
I know!
You should switch beds with me.

307
00:38:22,627 --> 00:38:23,863
No way!

308
00:38:23,929 --> 00:38:26,332
Ewe! Something smells.

309
00:38:26,398 --> 00:38:29,068
I think she breathed
on this pillow.

310
00:38:30,635 --> 00:38:32,637
Good night, girls.

311
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:34,772
Gross!

312
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,276
Quiet.
Lie down, lie down!

313
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:08,240
Esther, come with me.

314
00:40:59,685 --> 00:41:01,120
Easy.

315
00:41:02,288 --> 00:41:04,056
Easy.

316
00:41:07,626 --> 00:41:10,296
Hey, where did you come from?

317
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:30,082
Yeah, come on.

318
00:41:39,591 --> 00:41:43,595
Take a right,
the door's unlocked.

319
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:49,601
No, hold up.

320
00:42:01,146 --> 00:42:02,915
You're almost there.

321
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:10,589
You're clear, go now.

322
00:42:18,564 --> 00:42:19,698
Get away from those kids!

323
00:42:19,765 --> 00:42:21,066
What the...!

324
00:42:22,167 --> 00:42:23,535
Who the fuck are you?

325
00:42:23,602 --> 00:42:24,937
Get the fuck off me!

326
00:42:25,003 --> 00:42:27,841
Go! Get her, get her!

327
00:42:27,906 --> 00:42:30,175
- Hold still!
- Let me go!

328
00:42:30,242 --> 00:42:31,944
Hurry up.

329
00:42:46,625 --> 00:42:48,293
She intercepted us.

330
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:55,242
This is Cree land.

331
00:43:00,672 --> 00:43:03,108
Who are you and
where are you from?

332
00:43:05,845 --> 00:43:07,179
Answer the question.

333
00:43:11,417 --> 00:43:13,018
Niska Halcrow.

334
00:43:14,052 --> 00:43:15,921
Niska.

335
00:43:17,514 --> 00:43:18,390
You're Cree?

336
00:43:19,625 --> 00:43:21,393
From Kiskachewanohk.

337
00:43:24,188 --> 00:43:25,397
Do you speak Cree?

338
00:43:28,767 --> 00:43:30,235
A little.

339
00:43:31,437 --> 00:43:34,173
What are you doing
with the kids?

340
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:36,708
What were you doing
outside the academy?

341
00:43:39,378 --> 00:43:42,681
Actually, I was abducted
by some of your people

342
00:43:42,748 --> 00:43:44,249
along with two kids.

343
00:44:09,483 --> 00:44:11,026
Were you tracking her?

344
00:44:11,376 --> 00:44:12,879
No, but I've
seen her before.

345
00:44:12,946 --> 00:44:15,047
She's a berry seller
at the market.

346
00:44:16,073 --> 00:44:17,574
I think she might be okanaweyihcikew.

347
00:44:19,518 --> 00:44:21,987
Her? Really?

348
00:44:22,054 --> 00:44:23,890
Hmm-hmm.

349
00:44:23,957 --> 00:44:25,357
Charlie.

350
00:44:25,415 --> 00:44:28,460
Find out everything you can on her. Hurry.

351
00:44:29,061 --> 00:44:30,886
Don't let her out of your sight.

352
00:44:30,941 --> 00:44:33,131
I need to talk to the
Elders and the leaders.

353
00:44:33,382 --> 00:44:34,091
Wait.

354
00:44:34,174 --> 00:44:35,008
No.

355
00:44:35,676 --> 00:44:36,510
No.

356
00:44:37,803 --> 00:44:39,721
Our search may be over.

357
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:51,350
So as I put my laptop down
I see Leo and Somonis

358
00:44:51,416 --> 00:44:53,418
coming around the
corner with two kids,

359
00:44:53,485 --> 00:44:55,687
and out of nowhere
comes a flying punch.

360
00:44:55,754 --> 00:44:59,191
It was like whoosh!
Shot in the dark.

361
00:44:59,859 --> 00:45:02,494
Hiya! Like a Ninja.

362
00:45:04,204 --> 00:45:07,791
You were so busy playing around while
there was a battle going on,

363
00:45:07,833 --> 00:45:09,835
you didn't notice her coming.

364
00:45:11,436 --> 00:45:13,138
She wasn't like
the soldiers though.

365
00:45:13,205 --> 00:45:15,440
She was deadly silent.

366
00:45:16,383 --> 00:45:17,926
Just like your farts.

367
00:45:19,678 --> 00:45:23,081
I told you
that was personal. Whatever.

368
00:45:27,394 --> 00:45:28,937
Welcome Niska.

369
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:33,358
My name is Tiny.

370
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,235
Get her some food.

371
00:45:52,419 --> 00:45:54,796
I was woken up

372
00:45:55,172 --> 00:45:57,341
to come and meet this woman.

373
00:45:58,217 --> 00:45:59,051
Where is she?

374
00:45:59,968 --> 00:46:01,303
There she is.

375
00:46:01,345 --> 00:46:02,596
From Kiskachewanohk.

376
00:46:04,139 --> 00:46:05,057
Niska come.

377
00:46:23,575 --> 00:46:27,371
I am glad to meet you.

378
00:46:36,505 --> 00:46:44,721
Long ago, we were told that someone
would be arriving from the north.

379
00:46:45,097 --> 00:46:49,726
We have been waiting
for you for a long time.

380
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:54,147
You are the guardian.

381
00:47:03,365 --> 00:47:05,951
And now we will dance.

382
00:47:06,618 --> 00:47:14,751
Two more children have been brought back
along with one of our own. Welcome.

383
00:47:48,995 --> 00:47:50,762
Am I being held here?

384
00:47:50,830 --> 00:47:52,899
'Cause I really
need to get back.

385
00:47:56,768 --> 00:47:59,072
You ever live
with your own people?

386
00:47:59,138 --> 00:48:00,706
Have you?

387
00:48:02,441 --> 00:48:04,342
You're a long ways from home.

388
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:07,512
I go where I'm needed.

389
00:50:04,596 --> 00:50:06,631
You have
a child at the Academy?

390
00:50:20,645 --> 00:50:22,614
She was taken in the Fall.

391
00:50:24,783 --> 00:50:26,953
She was just a little one then.

392
00:50:31,423 --> 00:50:32,757
She's eleven.

393
00:50:38,865 --> 00:50:42,801
You survived a very long
time alone with her, Niska.

394
00:50:44,769 --> 00:50:47,974
It's remarkable that you were
able to protect her for so long.

395
00:50:49,141 --> 00:50:51,077
Not just anyone can do that.

396
00:50:54,779 --> 00:50:56,916
I'm going to find her again

397
00:50:57,749 --> 00:50:59,684
on the other side.

398
00:51:03,105 --> 00:51:06,149
You are welcome here
in Kitsaki, Niska.

399
00:51:06,775 --> 00:51:09,862
Come. Get some rest.

400
00:51:43,495 --> 00:51:44,931
Come this way.

401
00:52:23,519 --> 00:52:25,437
Welcome Niska.

402
00:52:26,272 --> 00:52:28,040
You guys said to me
I could leave now.

403
00:52:28,107 --> 00:52:30,109
I've got to get
back to the city.

404
00:52:31,485 --> 00:52:33,946
Waseese is in an evil place.

405
00:52:34,546 --> 00:52:35,513
Waseese is in danger.

406
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:37,984
What? Why?

407
00:52:38,050 --> 00:52:40,252
The Academy
isn't what you think.

408
00:52:40,285 --> 00:52:44,665
The kids are trained to become
Jingo puppets.

409
00:52:45,249 --> 00:52:47,960
They are subjected to unspeakable things.

410
00:52:49,161 --> 00:52:50,830
Okay.

411
00:52:50,896 --> 00:52:53,665
Well, let me talk to the kids
that you took last night then?

412
00:52:53,882 --> 00:52:56,134
Wouldn't you rather talk to Waseese?

413
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:00,472
We can get her from the Academy.

414
00:53:02,842 --> 00:53:05,344
Isn't it too
soon to go back?

415
00:53:05,352 --> 00:53:08,605
But there is one thing
we ask of you in return.

416
00:53:09,898 --> 00:53:14,069
We need you to take the children
to a safe zone up north.

417
00:53:14,286 --> 00:53:16,721
We need you to take the kids
to a safe zone up north.

418
00:53:16,788 --> 00:53:18,457
Bigstone. You've
heard of it, right?

419
00:53:18,523 --> 00:53:20,092
Bigstone's just a rumor.

420
00:53:20,117 --> 00:53:21,326
No, it's real.

421
00:53:21,827 --> 00:53:24,663
And we need someone
to take the children there.

422
00:53:25,865 --> 00:53:28,700
We need someone who knows
how to live off the land.

423
00:53:30,668 --> 00:53:32,972
How far is it?

424
00:53:33,039 --> 00:53:35,975
From Kiskachewanohk,
three weeks.

425
00:53:36,042 --> 00:53:37,343
Three weeks?

426
00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:38,676
That's way too far.

427
00:53:38,743 --> 00:53:39,945
Don't you want
your daughter back?

428
00:53:40,012 --> 00:53:41,579
Of course.

429
00:53:41,646 --> 00:53:44,150
But with a bunch of kids
for the drones to hunt?

430
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:50,356
You have no idea, do you?

431
00:53:51,723 --> 00:53:54,293
You need to get your daughter
out now while she has a chance.

432
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:56,829
Before it's too late to
reverse the brainwashing.

433
00:53:56,896 --> 00:53:58,297
Brainwashing? Come on.

434
00:53:58,364 --> 00:53:59,764
Brainwashing, yeah.

435
00:53:59,832 --> 00:54:02,435
Assimilation,
indoctrination, re-education.

436
00:54:02,501 --> 00:54:04,403
You ought to know, call it
whatever the fuck you like,

437
00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:05,871
but it's real.

438
00:54:05,938 --> 00:54:08,340
They get turned against
their own in there.

439
00:54:08,407 --> 00:54:12,811
Niska, you can't wait
for her to get to Emerson.

440
00:54:12,878 --> 00:54:14,746
Your daughter won't
be the same person

441
00:54:14,813 --> 00:54:16,714
when she comes out
of the Academy.

442
00:54:31,647 --> 00:54:35,526
We look at these rocks as
life forms, similar to the trees.

443
00:54:35,567 --> 00:54:38,654
This reflects how we see and think.

444
00:54:41,031 --> 00:54:42,824
This is a balsam tree.

445
00:54:45,244 --> 00:54:47,037
We use them in many different ways.

446
00:54:47,413 --> 00:54:48,948
You can't tell me that
you honestly believe

447
00:54:49,014 --> 00:54:50,516
she is better off
with the Jingoes.

448
00:54:50,583 --> 00:54:53,651
The Jingoes are morons
but at least she has food,

449
00:54:53,718 --> 00:54:55,187
medicine, an education.

450
00:54:55,254 --> 00:54:57,523
No, I don't believe you.
You kept her out for years.

451
00:54:57,590 --> 00:54:58,991
Yeah, and for what?

452
00:54:59,058 --> 00:55:00,192
So she could end up in
desperate fucking misery

453
00:55:00,259 --> 00:55:02,128
like all the rest of us?

454
00:55:02,194 --> 00:55:04,930
Look around you, You think
this is just about you kid?

455
00:55:04,997 --> 00:55:07,699
There's a whole way
of life at stake here.

456
00:55:11,636 --> 00:55:13,305
Not sure that won her over.

457
00:55:14,507 --> 00:55:16,708
She is not Ogunuheneechigew.

458
00:55:21,363 --> 00:55:22,489
What are you doing here?

459
00:55:22,948 --> 00:55:24,416
Respectfully Ida,
I don't think she's the one

460
00:55:24,483 --> 00:55:26,318
I think we're wasting
our time with her.

461
00:55:26,385 --> 00:55:27,685
No, you're wasting our time.

462
00:55:27,752 --> 00:55:29,654
She's just scared.

463
00:55:30,556 --> 00:55:31,991
You know she can do it.

464
00:55:33,125 --> 00:55:35,928
Yes, yes, but it doesn't
mean she will do it.

465
00:55:36,837 --> 00:55:38,797
You better go convince her then.

466
00:59:26,725 --> 00:59:28,060
Hey, Lorna.

467
00:59:32,931 --> 00:59:34,433
Lorna?

468
00:59:51,817 --> 00:59:53,419
Niska! Niska!

469
00:59:55,821 --> 00:59:57,589
Hey, where have you been?

470
00:59:57,656 --> 00:59:59,024
What's going on?

471
00:59:59,091 --> 01:00:00,559
There's a virus.

472
01:00:00,626 --> 01:00:02,194
Everything's fucked.

473
01:00:03,061 --> 01:00:04,163
The borders are
closing tonight.

474
01:00:04,229 --> 01:00:06,665
- We gotta go now.
- What?

475
01:00:11,537 --> 01:00:13,238
Hey, it's okay.

476
01:00:15,774 --> 01:00:17,509
We gotta go pick up our IDs.

477
01:00:22,414 --> 01:00:24,283
What do you know about Bigstone?

478
01:00:25,551 --> 01:00:26,718
What's the matter?

479
01:00:26,785 --> 01:00:29,421
We're going to leave this
hell hole forever, okay?

480
01:00:29,488 --> 01:00:33,292
We're going to leave all our
struggles behind, all right?

481
01:00:34,660 --> 01:00:36,161
We gotta go.

482
01:00:42,601 --> 01:00:45,471
There is a mandatory
evacuation order in effect.

483
01:00:45,537 --> 01:00:47,874
Please report to your
designated departure point.

484
01:00:47,941 --> 01:00:48,974
Roberta!

485
01:00:49,041 --> 01:00:51,343
Hey! You're okay.

486
01:00:52,846 --> 01:00:55,681
They raided my place.
They took everyone away.

487
01:00:55,747 --> 01:00:57,182
Oh no.

488
01:00:57,249 --> 01:01:00,419
And they're spreading
shit in our food.

489
01:01:02,654 --> 01:01:04,122
Hey, hey.

490
01:01:04,189 --> 01:01:08,026
I just can't find my cat.
Meow, meow...

491
01:01:08,093 --> 01:01:09,495
Listen, we gotta go.

492
01:01:10,662 --> 01:01:12,832
Okay look, there's a pop-up
shelter in Jamestown.

493
01:01:12,899 --> 01:01:14,199
We can drop her off there,

494
01:01:14,266 --> 01:01:15,734
we can't get her
across the border.

495
01:01:17,102 --> 01:01:19,037
Hey, do you want to come?

496
01:01:19,104 --> 01:01:20,038
Where are we going?

497
01:01:20,105 --> 01:01:21,240
Yeah, come on.

498
01:01:21,306 --> 01:01:23,041
Somewhere safe.

499
01:01:24,743 --> 01:01:27,412
Please report to
your designated departure point.

500
01:01:29,916 --> 01:01:31,383
Oh shit.

501
01:01:48,534 --> 01:01:50,068
Hey!

502
01:01:50,135 --> 01:01:51,938
There's a mandatory evacuation
order in effect.

503
01:01:52,005 --> 01:01:53,305
Come with me.

504
01:01:53,372 --> 01:01:55,107
We can just go home!

505
01:01:55,173 --> 01:01:57,376
No, ma'am, let's go.

506
01:01:57,442 --> 01:01:59,077
Stay together.

507
01:01:59,144 --> 01:02:00,746
Let's go, keep moving.

508
01:02:04,616 --> 01:02:06,752
It's okay, it's okay.

509
01:02:08,387 --> 01:02:09,956
- Through here.
- This is what they do.

510
01:02:10,023 --> 01:02:11,523
Through here.

511
01:02:14,426 --> 01:02:18,063
He's clear.
Move on. Hold, sir! See?

512
01:02:20,265 --> 01:02:21,767
He's good, move on.

513
01:02:21,834 --> 01:02:23,802
- Cuff him.
- Yes, sir.

514
01:02:26,572 --> 01:02:28,574
Oh no, no.

515
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:29,508
No.

516
01:02:29,575 --> 01:02:31,410
Look, she can't get on there.

517
01:02:31,476 --> 01:02:33,712
Everyone's going. Cuff her.

518
01:02:40,085 --> 01:02:41,520
Let me see.

519
01:02:42,154 --> 01:02:43,555
Okay.

520
01:02:44,489 --> 01:02:45,824
Just do what they say.

521
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:57,336
Hey! I'm gonna
throw this up front,

522
01:02:57,402 --> 01:02:59,638
and when it goes off we
get the fuck out the back.

523
01:03:02,341 --> 01:03:03,843
She comes with us.

524
01:03:15,687 --> 01:03:16,923
Pierre!

525
01:03:16,990 --> 01:03:18,256
- Hey!
- Roberta!

526
01:03:18,323 --> 01:03:20,225
- Pierre!
- Hey! Ma'am, ma'am!

527
01:03:20,292 --> 01:03:22,028
- Sit down and be quiet.
- Roberta!

528
01:03:22,095 --> 01:03:23,195
Pierre!

529
01:03:23,261 --> 01:03:24,329
- Be quiet.
- Roberta.

530
01:03:24,396 --> 01:03:26,032
- Hey!
- That's my son!

531
01:03:26,099 --> 01:03:28,433
Sit down and be quiet. Ma'am!

532
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:30,736
I just have to go out
and see him.

533
01:03:32,704 --> 01:03:34,073
Sit. Down.

534
01:03:34,139 --> 01:03:35,540
- Come on, it's okay.
- Please.

535
01:03:35,607 --> 01:03:37,844
- It's okay just sit.
- Sit down.

536
01:03:37,910 --> 01:03:39,846
Come on, Roberta! Come on.

537
01:03:48,153 --> 01:03:49,521
Hey! Hey!

538
01:03:49,588 --> 01:03:51,823
Get back in your seat now!

539
01:03:51,891 --> 01:03:53,725
Get down, now!

540
01:03:53,792 --> 01:03:54,526
Pierre!

541
01:03:54,593 --> 01:03:56,595
Come on! Niska!

542
01:03:56,662 --> 01:03:58,497
Pierre!

543
01:04:06,805 --> 01:04:08,141
Get off of him!

544
01:04:08,206 --> 01:04:10,208
Let him go, right now!

545
01:04:16,581 --> 01:04:19,451
At the back,
at the back.

546
01:04:19,518 --> 01:04:22,387
Let me cut this.
Come on! Let's go.

547
01:04:26,125 --> 01:04:27,894
Hey, don't move!

548
01:04:29,461 --> 01:04:31,763
Drop your weapon.

549
01:04:31,831 --> 01:04:33,465
Pierre.

550
01:04:35,168 --> 01:04:36,568
It's me.

551
01:04:49,182 --> 01:04:51,416
Stay back, stay back!

552
01:04:56,722 --> 01:04:58,390
I said stay back!

553
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:03,328
You remember me?

554
01:05:10,103 --> 01:05:11,737
You do remember.

555
01:05:13,338 --> 01:05:15,640
No, you're just
a fucking freeloader.

556
01:05:15,707 --> 01:05:16,843
No!

557
01:05:25,283 --> 01:05:26,785
Roberta!

558
01:05:30,089 --> 01:05:31,823
Why did he do that?

559
01:05:36,261 --> 01:05:37,830
He was her son.

560
01:06:03,455 --> 01:06:05,024
Is it too late?

561
01:06:06,259 --> 01:06:07,894
No.

562
01:06:08,527 --> 01:06:10,395
But we have to go now.

563
01:06:20,173 --> 01:06:22,374
- Hey.
- Hey.

564
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:24,911
- Put some pressure on it.
- Okay.

565
01:06:32,617 --> 01:06:34,386
All right, let's go.

566
01:06:40,259 --> 01:06:41,726
Come on we gotta...

567
01:06:41,793 --> 01:06:43,762
I'm sorry.

568
01:06:45,064 --> 01:06:46,665
I gotta go.

569
01:06:47,766 --> 01:06:48,868
Niska?

570
01:06:50,169 --> 01:06:51,469
Niska!

571
01:07:08,254 --> 01:07:09,956
Hungry?

572
01:07:10,022 --> 01:07:11,790
No thanks.

573
01:07:12,992 --> 01:07:15,560
I haven't been in a car
in a while.

574
01:07:16,494 --> 01:07:18,763
Just take it for later.

575
01:07:18,831 --> 01:07:20,132
Thanks.

576
01:07:28,174 --> 01:07:30,775
How do you get past
the check points in this?

577
01:07:31,676 --> 01:07:33,378
This guy's passport.

578
01:07:33,445 --> 01:07:35,480
You have a passport?

579
01:07:36,115 --> 01:07:38,483
How?

580
01:07:38,550 --> 01:07:41,320
My dad,
he's an energy diplomat.

581
01:07:41,386 --> 01:07:43,822
He brokers oil between nations.

582
01:07:43,890 --> 01:07:47,059
That's why he's always on his
high horse about everything.

583
01:07:50,629 --> 01:07:52,764
Did you know
about the virus?

584
01:07:55,467 --> 01:07:57,069
Yeah.

585
01:07:57,136 --> 01:07:58,838
It was made in Emerson.

586
01:08:01,806 --> 01:08:03,976
Jingoes want to
start the war again.

587
01:08:05,211 --> 01:08:08,080
And now force our kids
onto the front lines of it.

588
01:08:14,786 --> 01:08:17,089
And what's Ogunuheneechigew?

589
01:08:17,156 --> 01:08:18,925
It means Guardian.

590
01:08:23,428 --> 01:08:24,763
Three Summers ago,

591
01:08:24,830 --> 01:08:28,100
Elder Chachigee
went into the bush.

592
01:08:28,167 --> 01:08:32,104
She fasted and prayed for
four days and four nights.

593
01:08:33,438 --> 01:08:35,174
Images came to her.

594
01:08:36,474 --> 01:08:39,045
First, mosquitoes.

595
01:08:39,946 --> 01:08:42,714
But these mosquitoes
were massive,

596
01:08:42,781 --> 01:08:45,817
ten times bigger than
regular mosquitoes.

597
01:08:47,086 --> 01:08:51,623
She saw an angry swarm of
them in the sky coming for us.

598
01:08:54,759 --> 01:08:56,761
She also said
a stranger would come

599
01:08:56,828 --> 01:08:58,831
to the camp from the north.

600
01:09:02,301 --> 01:09:04,103
And this stranger,

601
01:09:04,170 --> 01:09:05,603
the guardian,

602
01:09:05,670 --> 01:09:08,174
would ensure the
survival of her people.

603
01:09:09,641 --> 01:09:11,509
Yeah, so no pressure.

604
01:09:11,576 --> 01:09:14,447
And that's why
people think I came?

605
01:09:14,512 --> 01:09:16,115
Well, some people.

606
01:09:16,182 --> 01:09:18,616
Super-sized mosquitoes?

607
01:09:18,683 --> 01:09:20,485
Look, just
forget about that okay?

608
01:09:20,552 --> 01:09:22,721
We help you,
you help us, that's it.

609
01:09:31,297 --> 01:09:33,798
Fucking Jingoes
keep expanding their mine.

610
01:09:39,271 --> 01:09:41,941
As long as we have
one piece of land,

611
01:09:42,875 --> 01:09:44,877
they will always come for us.

612
01:10:00,558 --> 01:10:02,560
Come on, let's go.

613
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:44,236
No one has ever made
it so far before.

614
01:10:45,538 --> 01:10:46,906
Did you have help?

615
01:10:53,079 --> 01:10:54,679
I see.

616
01:10:56,614 --> 01:10:58,884
I've been watching you,
Elizabeth.

617
01:11:03,289 --> 01:11:05,590
The people you come
from aren't bad,

618
01:11:05,657 --> 01:11:07,960
but they are incapable.

619
01:11:09,428 --> 01:11:12,565
They have to come to us
for hand-outs because

620
01:11:12,630 --> 01:11:14,834
they can't hold down jobs.

621
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:17,669
They can't take care
of their own families.

622
01:11:18,838 --> 01:11:20,372
That's not true.

623
01:11:21,340 --> 01:11:22,807
Oh, really?

624
01:11:24,844 --> 01:11:27,179
How do you think
you came to be here?

625
01:11:35,454 --> 01:11:37,990
That's your mom, right?

626
01:11:42,495 --> 01:11:44,029
She gave you up.

627
01:11:50,069 --> 01:11:52,138
Elizabeth,

628
01:11:52,204 --> 01:11:54,874
you have what
it takes to make it.

629
01:12:22,601 --> 01:12:23,869
She's in trouble.

630
01:12:31,477 --> 01:12:32,978
Can anyone do it?

631
01:12:34,547 --> 01:12:35,780
Victoria.

632
01:12:39,285 --> 01:12:41,819
Ready? Go.

633
01:12:53,232 --> 01:12:54,300
12.9 seconds.

634
01:12:54,366 --> 01:12:56,001
Good.

635
01:12:56,068 --> 01:12:57,802
Anyone else?

636
01:12:59,071 --> 01:13:01,773
Elizabeth, come up.

637
01:13:12,817 --> 01:13:14,286
Okay. Go.

638
01:13:23,229 --> 01:13:25,197
5.4 seconds.

639
01:13:25,264 --> 01:13:26,665
Excellent work.

640
01:13:26,731 --> 01:13:29,268
That is a new Academy record.

641
01:13:30,536 --> 01:13:32,538
She cheated.

642
01:13:32,605 --> 01:13:33,805
Pardon?

643
01:13:34,673 --> 01:13:36,275
The savage cheated!

644
01:13:58,731 --> 01:14:00,232
Ma'am?

645
01:14:01,533 --> 01:14:02,835
Enough.

646
01:14:06,771 --> 01:14:08,340
Elizabeth, step forward.

647
01:14:09,375 --> 01:14:10,808
Hut!

648
01:14:12,511 --> 01:14:14,913
Does anyone dare challenge her?

649
01:14:18,384 --> 01:14:21,786
Are you ready to give yourself
to your country completely?

650
01:14:22,521 --> 01:14:24,023
Yes.

651
01:14:24,089 --> 01:14:26,824
Are you ready to defend your
liberty and your freedom?

652
01:14:26,892 --> 01:14:28,594
- Yes.
- Good.

653
01:14:28,661 --> 01:14:32,831
Because tomorrow, you will be
departing for Emerson State.

654
01:14:32,898 --> 01:14:35,434
Congratulations.

655
01:14:35,501 --> 01:14:36,969
Please.

656
01:14:42,408 --> 01:14:44,610
We pledge our
hearts and give our allegiance

657
01:14:44,677 --> 01:14:47,579
to our glorious Republic.

658
01:14:47,646 --> 01:14:51,250
We praise the great southern
nation for emancipating us

659
01:14:51,317 --> 01:14:53,252
and solemnly swear
to protect it,

660
01:14:53,319 --> 01:14:55,820
in the name of God,
our liberty and freedom.

661
01:14:55,888 --> 01:14:59,892
One country,
one language, one flag.

662
01:15:13,238 --> 01:15:15,040
- Can I go in there?
- No.

663
01:15:15,107 --> 01:15:17,409
But they've been
in there for hours.

664
01:15:20,512 --> 01:15:21,880
Hey!

665
01:15:25,084 --> 01:15:27,133
This is a private
council meeting.

666
01:15:27,188 --> 01:15:28,195
Come in.

667
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:31,056
We're supposed to be
preparing for the raid.

668
01:15:31,757 --> 01:15:33,359
Is there a problem?

669
01:15:33,408 --> 01:15:38,580
All of our relations are meeting here.

670
01:15:39,039 --> 01:15:44,211
We need to do this in a good way
and think in a good way.

671
01:15:45,128 --> 01:15:47,172
Thank you grandmother.

672
01:15:47,881 --> 01:15:53,512
We must evacuate the camp
children by tonight.

673
01:15:54,246 --> 01:15:55,914
I don't understand.

674
01:15:55,981 --> 01:15:58,406
We are going to get my
daughter tonight, right?

675
01:15:58,484 --> 01:16:00,853
The Jingoes have built a new mining road

676
01:16:00,894 --> 01:16:03,981
overnight that is heading
straight for our camp.

677
01:16:04,356 --> 01:16:05,826
We're concerned that we've run
out of time for the raid.

678
01:16:05,896 --> 01:16:07,126
The Jingoes are building a road

679
01:16:07,192 --> 01:16:09,094
heading straight for Kitsaki.

680
01:16:14,032 --> 01:16:15,534
We may be out of time.

681
01:16:16,235 --> 01:16:17,746
But you agreed to help me.

682
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:21,331
We want to help but they've advanced much
faster than what we thought.

683
01:16:21,875 --> 01:16:25,077
I'm not taking those kids
unless we pick up Waseese first.

684
01:16:25,144 --> 01:16:28,147
And you'll endanger every
free child we've rescued.

685
01:16:28,914 --> 01:16:30,460
Every single one in this camp!

686
01:16:30,538 --> 01:16:38,265
Long ago, our grandfathers were here.
They all lived here.

687
01:16:39,016 --> 01:16:47,316
But then this government
forced us to leave.

688
01:16:48,275 --> 01:16:55,240
They even tried to kill us.

689
01:16:55,782 --> 01:16:58,702
They even tried to kill us.

690
01:16:58,827 --> 01:17:00,162
But they could not do it.

691
01:17:00,954 --> 01:17:05,083
We are still here.

692
01:17:08,170 --> 01:17:12,174
The goose is never alone on a journey.

693
01:17:12,424 --> 01:17:20,098
In order to succeed,
she always travels with a partner.

694
01:17:20,474 --> 01:17:23,393
This is what we also have to do as people.

695
01:17:25,062 --> 01:17:27,189
Thank you grandmother.

696
01:17:29,074 --> 01:17:30,676
We'll get Waseese tonight

697
01:17:30,742 --> 01:17:33,245
and then you take
the kids to Bigstone.

698
01:17:33,987 --> 01:17:37,241
Niska, do we agree or not?

699
01:17:40,519 --> 01:17:41,653
Thank you.

700
01:17:42,454 --> 01:17:45,916
Somonis, prepare the
camp. Leo and Charlie,

701
01:17:45,958 --> 01:17:49,086
you'll raid tonight for the last time.

702
01:17:54,399 --> 01:17:58,470
If anything happens to
these kids, it's on you.

703
01:18:05,077 --> 01:18:06,745
Come on.

704
01:18:24,696 --> 01:18:27,599
Okay, we're in.

705
01:18:52,424 --> 01:18:53,792
Take a right.

706
01:18:54,693 --> 01:18:56,361
Okay, let's go.

707
01:19:11,044 --> 01:19:13,145
Guard station up ahead.

708
01:19:54,686 --> 01:19:57,189
Okay, station number 14.

709
01:19:57,255 --> 01:19:59,025
- What's going on?
- Just one minute.

710
01:19:59,092 --> 01:20:00,826
- We don't have a minute!
- You in, Charlie?

711
01:20:00,893 --> 01:20:02,461
Yeah, I'm in.

712
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:10,602
Room 26
should be on your left.

713
01:21:00,686 --> 01:21:01,820
Door's unlocked.

714
01:21:50,602 --> 01:21:51,737
Waseese,

715
01:21:53,672 --> 01:21:55,007
Waseese.

716
01:21:59,711 --> 01:22:00,880
Mom?

717
01:22:01,948 --> 01:22:03,648
What are you doing here?

718
01:22:06,986 --> 01:22:08,453
We gotta go.

719
01:22:10,957 --> 01:22:12,290
No...

720
01:22:15,094 --> 01:22:16,762
you left me behind.

721
01:22:17,462 --> 01:22:20,465
I know. I know I did.

722
01:22:23,435 --> 01:22:27,339
But I was wondering
if you might...

723
01:22:28,373 --> 01:22:30,943
if you might want to
come back with me.

724
01:22:41,286 --> 01:22:42,721
I'm sorry.

725
01:22:43,555 --> 01:22:45,423
I'm so sorry.

726
01:22:47,392 --> 01:22:48,928
I'm here now.

727
01:22:50,395 --> 01:22:52,330
It won't happen again, okay?

728
01:23:17,689 --> 01:23:19,192
Aw, shit.

729
01:23:27,133 --> 01:23:28,767
Clear. Down here.

730
01:23:37,676 --> 01:23:38,878
Leo!

731
01:23:41,479 --> 01:23:42,982
Okay, stay here. All right?

732
01:23:48,254 --> 01:23:51,157
- Does anyone copy?
- Leo, are you hurt?

733
01:23:51,224 --> 01:23:52,191
Nah, I'm good.

734
01:23:52,258 --> 01:23:53,893
Can you hear me?

735
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:55,694
- Yeah. We're good, bro.
- Oh geez.

736
01:23:57,529 --> 01:24:00,132
Oh shit.
More soldiers.

737
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:04,436
Leo, I found out
they discovered Kinsaki.

738
01:24:04,502 --> 01:24:06,504
They're sending
troops to the camp!

739
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:10,642
I can't get back in
time to save those kids.

740
01:24:11,643 --> 01:24:13,545
But you promised.

741
01:24:21,053 --> 01:24:23,122
You never stood
a chance out there.

742
01:24:23,189 --> 01:24:24,589
Niska, please don't do this.

743
01:24:24,656 --> 01:24:26,025
We'll find a way.

744
01:24:26,092 --> 01:24:27,193
Mom?

745
01:24:27,260 --> 01:24:28,361
Yeah?

746
01:24:28,426 --> 01:24:29,694
I think it's coming...

747
01:24:29,761 --> 01:24:30,963
Soldiers?

748
01:24:31,030 --> 01:24:32,164
No.

749
01:24:40,206 --> 01:24:41,841
Oh fuck.

750
01:24:41,908 --> 01:24:44,043
You gotta get out of there, now!

751
01:24:44,110 --> 01:24:46,711
No, No.
I'm going to distract them

752
01:24:46,778 --> 01:24:48,281
and you're going to
get out of here, okay?

753
01:24:48,347 --> 01:24:49,315
What?

754
01:24:49,382 --> 01:24:50,715
- Get out of here!
- No.

755
01:24:50,782 --> 01:24:52,450
- Take the kids north.
- No, Leo. I can't!

756
01:24:52,517 --> 01:24:53,920
You will.

757
01:24:57,789 --> 01:25:00,692
Move, move,
move, hold up.

758
01:25:07,499 --> 01:25:10,169
Fall back! Move, move, move.

759
01:25:36,062 --> 01:25:38,064
Get down.

760
01:25:49,442 --> 01:25:50,409
Let's move! Let's move!

761
01:25:50,475 --> 01:25:52,211
Go, go, go, go!

762
01:25:52,278 --> 01:25:53,778
Charlie, lock the doors!

763
01:25:59,318 --> 01:26:01,553
- You okay?
- Yeah.

764
01:26:01,619 --> 01:26:03,923
Get as many as we can.

765
01:26:06,658 --> 01:26:08,894
Get up, get up!

766
01:26:12,431 --> 01:26:13,833
Come on, come on.

767
01:26:13,899 --> 01:26:16,102
Get up, get up, get up.

768
01:26:18,603 --> 01:26:20,373
Come on, hurry up!

769
01:26:20,439 --> 01:26:22,640
Hey bro, we need a way out.

770
01:26:22,707 --> 01:26:24,210
Copy that.

771
01:26:24,276 --> 01:26:25,710
I know a way out.

772
01:26:25,777 --> 01:26:27,812
Hey, never mind, bro,
we're on it.

773
01:26:28,780 --> 01:26:30,515
Just meet us at the
rendezvous point.

774
01:26:30,582 --> 01:26:32,218
- Let's go!
- Yup.

775
01:26:32,284 --> 01:26:34,020
Oh, Charlie? Release the horses.

776
01:26:39,191 --> 01:26:41,293
Only pack necessities!

777
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:43,396
Not a dream catcher.

778
01:26:43,462 --> 01:26:46,098
Don't panic, we've got bannock.

779
01:26:48,300 --> 01:26:50,965
Soldiers, soldiers
on the perimeter.

780
01:26:51,021 --> 01:26:53,839
Run!

781
01:26:58,677 --> 01:27:00,220
Any sign of them?

782
01:27:01,080 --> 01:27:02,928
Fuck!

783
01:27:02,991 --> 01:27:04,600
How many?

784
01:27:05,017 --> 01:27:05,711
Twenty...

785
01:27:05,781 --> 01:27:06,952
Maybe 25.

786
01:27:16,403 --> 01:27:18,197
I'll get the kids out.

787
01:27:18,488 --> 01:27:20,032
You lead the line.

788
01:27:21,133 --> 01:27:22,531
But we need you.

789
01:27:22,611 --> 01:27:23,368
No.

790
01:27:23,535 --> 01:27:26,788
The kids need protection.

791
01:27:27,581 --> 01:27:29,249
You can do this.

792
01:27:35,923 --> 01:27:40,969
Nothing makes me more proud
than to stand with you all.

793
01:27:42,221 --> 01:27:47,226
If we take our last breaths fighting
against our colonizers,

794
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:51,772
then it will be a good way to die.

795
01:27:57,069 --> 01:27:59,112
Somonis will lead the line.

796
01:28:44,350 --> 01:28:46,118
Warrior up!

797
01:28:46,785 --> 01:28:49,288
Give me enough time to get them out.

798
01:29:45,010 --> 01:29:48,013
Company, halt!

799
01:29:50,616 --> 01:29:55,087
This is an illegal encampment,
you must surrender now.

800
01:29:59,491 --> 01:30:00,960
Hold the line!

801
01:30:02,595 --> 01:30:04,029
Watch out!

802
01:30:18,810 --> 01:30:20,412
Let it through!

803
01:30:26,118 --> 01:30:28,654
They just let you through?

804
01:30:28,721 --> 01:30:31,156
Yeah, I know, I don't get it.

805
01:30:34,860 --> 01:30:37,863
They're not here to attack
us they're here to keep us in!

806
01:30:37,930 --> 01:30:39,797
Mom, we have to go.

807
01:30:39,865 --> 01:30:41,799
- Get over here.
- Don't you hear that?

808
01:30:41,867 --> 01:30:43,902
- What?
- Hear what, Waseese?

809
01:30:51,543 --> 01:30:52,945
Oh shit.

810
01:31:13,599 --> 01:31:15,134
Get in! Get in!

811
01:31:17,236 --> 01:31:18,370
Shit.

812
01:31:25,611 --> 01:31:27,680
Fight to the end!

813
01:31:27,746 --> 01:31:29,248
Get ready!

814
01:31:31,483 --> 01:31:33,786
Waseese, no!

815
01:31:33,852 --> 01:31:35,921
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!

816
01:31:42,161 --> 01:31:43,862
She can hear them.

817
01:32:19,365 --> 01:32:21,567
Niska is the guardian of her.

818
01:32:50,963 --> 01:32:52,564
Forward.

819
01:32:54,299 --> 01:32:55,367
Down.

820
01:33:05,043 --> 01:33:07,479
Now get the fuck off our land.

821
01:33:07,546 --> 01:33:09,081
Go! Go!

822
01:33:10,783 --> 01:33:13,419
Retreat!
Retreat, fall back!

823
01:33:14,787 --> 01:33:16,388
Let's go!

824
01:33:27,466 --> 01:33:28,634
No!

825
01:33:29,601 --> 01:33:31,470
Niska!

826
01:33:31,537 --> 01:33:33,505
Mom! No, mom!

827
01:33:33,572 --> 01:33:35,607
No, no, no, no.

828
01:33:35,674 --> 01:33:36,843
Medic.

829
01:33:36,910 --> 01:33:38,143
- Put some pressure on it!
- Bandage.

830
01:33:38,210 --> 01:33:40,145
She got hit
in the shoulder.

831
01:33:41,980 --> 01:33:43,649
We've got you, Niska.

832
01:33:53,058 --> 01:33:54,726
How did you do that?

833
01:34:20,652 --> 01:34:22,254
Come here.

834
01:34:48,772 --> 01:34:54,319
It was her mother that brought her to us.

835
01:34:55,445 --> 01:34:58,198
All the way down from the north.

836
01:34:59,324 --> 01:35:06,331
She came back to her people
to protect us on that day.

837
01:35:09,251 --> 01:35:13,255
We call her the guardian.

838
