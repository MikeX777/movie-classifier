Will some of you men give
me a hand here, please?

00:21:41,886 --> 00:21:43,681
Yeah, right.

These men don't

224
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,687
I'll decide that, Doctor.

225
00:25:08,645 --> 00:25:11,924
Right now, Cliff's in
agonizing pain 48 hours

226
00:25:12,027 --> 00:25:15,203

227
00:25:15,306 --> 00:25:20,035
He too shall be tossed into

who attempt to escape from this
camp or any other camp you're

231

232
00:25:32,841 --> 00:25:38,295
You six men knew of the escape,
and yet you said nothing.

233
00:25:38,398 --> 00:25:42,264
You shall remain here for
three days on bread and water.

234
00:25:42,368 --> 00:25:46,510
This sort of punishment was
outlawed years ago, Warden.

235
00:25:46,614 --> 00:25:51,342
You shall stay here
for four days, Mitchell.

236
00:25:51,446 --> 00:25:54,207
And I shall add one
additional day for every word

237
00:25:54,311 --> 00:25:57,625
I hear from any of you!

238
00:25:57,728 --> 00:26:01,732
Officer McGee was
murdered because you

239
00:26:01,836 --> 00:26:05,218

240
00:26:05,322 --> 00:26:06,219

Yes, Mr. Wilson.

Don't leave me, Jay!

Don't go away, Jay!

257
00:28:06,443 --> 00:28:08,341
Help, Jay!

00:30:09,704 --> 00:30:11,395
We must have the
liquid back in the can.

00:30:14,157 --> 00:30:15,330
We will destroy the living.

269
00:30:22,441 --> 00:30:23,822

--[sighs] This will help
you to sleep, Carol.

I can't sleep

00:30:58,097 --> 00:31:00,168
Now, now, Paul's
going to be all right.

277
00:31:00,272 --> 00:31:01,480
He was lucky.

278
00:31:01,583 --> 00:31:03,275
I'm going to have him
transferred to the county

279
00:31:03,378 --> 00:31:06,174
hospital in a couple
of days, and he'll

280
00:31:06,278 --> 00:31:08,004
get good treatment there.

281
00:31:08,107 --> 00:31:11,800
You'll be able to get an
apartment in the city.

282
00:31:11,904 --> 00:31:16,046
Now, you just
relax and this drug

283
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:18,324
will take effect real soon.

284
00:31:18,428 --> 00:31:20,154
And when you awaken,
this horrible nightmare

285
00:31:20,257 --> 00:31:22,190
will be all over.

286
00:31:22,294 --> 00:31:24,537
And you and Paul will
be together again.

287
00:31:24,641 --> 00:31:25,849
All right?

288
00:31:25,953 --> 00:31:26,850
Thank you, Doctor.

It's very nice of you to take
care of Carol the way you did,

00:38:11,806 --> 00:38:12,807
You take it back with you now.

376
00:38:12,911 --> 00:38:14,706
I want no one out here alone.

377
00:38:14,809 --> 00:38:15,672
Now, do you understand that?

378
00:38:15,776 --> 00:38:16,501
Yes, sir.

379
00:38:19,262 --> 00:38:19,952
Call your men.

380
00:38:20,056 --> 00:38:21,851
I want you to stay together.

381
00:38:21,954 --> 00:38:24,302
Keep your flashlights
on the bushes

382
00:38:24,405 --> 00:38:25,406
along the sides of the road.

383
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:26,338
PRISON GUARD: Yes, sir.

384
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:31,861
Looks like somebody
got to him with an axe.

385
00:38:31,964 --> 00:38:34,519
Bradock was carrying an axe.

386
00:38:34,622 --> 00:38:36,003
Don't talk foolish.

387
00:38:36,106 --> 00:38:37,418
Johnson's wife
said a group of men

388
00:38:37,522 --> 00:38:39,109
attacked the trailer court
tonight and killed a man

389
00:38:39,213 --> 00:38:41,319
and woman in the same way!

390
00:38:41,422 --> 00:38:45,184
Warden, believe me, I saw
Bradock and the others!

391
00:38:45,288 --> 00:38:47,601
Issue every man
two boxes of ammo.

392
00:38:47,704 --> 00:38:48,843
Yes, sir.

393
00:38:48,947 --> 00:38:51,294
Uh, Warden, what about
the prisoners in the yard?

394
00:38:51,398 --> 00:38:54,815
So far, Jablonski, nothing
has happened inside the camp.

395
00:38:54,918 --> 00:38:55,954
The prisoners stay
where they are.

396
00:38:56,057 --> 00:38:57,335
I saw Bradock and the others!

397
00:38:57,438 --> 00:38:58,853
No, no!

398
00:38:58,957 --> 00:38:59,958
You saw somebody!

399
00:39:00,061 --> 00:39:02,788
So did I. But you
didn't see any dead men!

400
00:39:09,381 --> 00:39:12,246

401
00:40:02,676 --> 00:40:04,505
[laughing]

402
00:40:44,752 --> 00:40:47,721
There's lots of tracks, sir.

403
00:40:47,824 --> 00:40:50,655
It looks like they
all came inside.

404
00:40:50,758 --> 00:40:53,727
Sergeant, form search
parties, each one

405
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:55,591
taking a section of the camp.

406
00:40:55,694 --> 00:40:57,869
Yes, sir.

407
00:40:57,972 --> 00:41:00,250
Let one of us drive to town
so we can call the Sheriff's

408
00:41:00,354 --> 00:41:02,632
station at Brightwood.

409
00:41:02,736 --> 00:41:04,910
There's nothing here we can't
handle ourselves, Jablonski.

410
00:41:38,806 --> 00:41:41,222
Ahh!

411
00:41:41,326 --> 00:41:43,224
[zombies growling]

412
00:42:19,329 --> 00:42:20,227
Warden!

413
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:23,195
Get us out of here!

414
00:42:23,299 --> 00:42:24,714
[men shouting]

418
00:42:46,322 --> 00:42:47,737
That's Coler!

419
00:42:47,841 --> 00:42:48,738
Can't be Coler!

420
00:42:48,842 --> 00:42:51,223
That's Coler, I tell you!

421
00:42:51,327 --> 00:42:52,224
Can't be Coler!

All right, you men!

425
00:43:44,898 --> 00:43:48,039
Get back to your posts!

426
00:43:48,142 --> 00:43:48,902
It's Coler.

427
00:43:52,906 --> 00:43:54,804
Yes.

428
00:43:54,908 --> 00:43:57,255
[moaning and screaming]

429
00:44:02,329 --> 00:44:03,226
The light!

430
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:04,193
The light!

431
00:44:04,296 --> 00:44:06,713
That light on him.

432
00:44:06,816 --> 00:44:07,679
The light is killing him!

433
00:44:12,235 --> 00:44:14,134

434
00:44:30,081 --> 00:44:30,978

435
00:44:33,636 --> 00:44:34,741
My--
-Warden!

436
00:44:34,844 --> 00:44:35,742
---god!

437
00:44:35,845 --> 00:44:37,640
Warden, all the
vehicles are useless!

438
00:44:37,744 --> 00:44:38,434
Useless?

439
00:44:38,537 --> 00:44:39,884
What are you talking about?

440
00:44:52,344 --> 00:44:54,208
[growling]

441
00:45:05,668 --> 00:45:08,015
[screaming]

442
00:45:08,119 --> 00:45:10,052
Jablonski.

443
00:45:10,155 --> 00:45:12,123
Get your youngest
and fastest man.

444
00:45:12,226 --> 00:45:13,780
Get him to run in the
direction of Brightwood.

445
00:45:13,883 --> 00:45:15,989
Tell the sheriff there
we need assistance.

446
00:45:16,092 --> 00:45:16,783
Yes, sir.

447
00:45:19,855 --> 00:45:22,961
--[inaudible], get
that rudder going.

448
00:45:23,065 --> 00:45:23,893
Yes, sir.

449
00:45:39,771 --> 00:45:40,807
All right, you
men, hit the floor.

450
00:45:43,602 --> 00:45:44,327
Shoot, Warden!

451
00:45:44,431 --> 00:45:45,743
For God's sake, shoot!

452
00:45:45,846 --> 00:45:51,162
A shotgun at close
range is our only chance.

453
00:45:51,265 --> 00:45:51,956
[gunshot]

454
00:45:52,059 --> 00:45:52,750
Ahh!

[moans]

456
00:46:08,524 --> 00:46:09,905
Get those men out to
the generator plant.

457
00:46:10,008 --> 00:46:10,698
Why there?

458
00:46:10,802 --> 00:46:11,803
They'll be safe there.

459
00:46:11,907 --> 00:46:12,942
That building's made
of reinforced concrete.

460
00:46:24,091 --> 00:46:25,265
-Warden!
-Yes?

461
00:46:25,368 --> 00:46:26,438
I sent Bob Linford.

462
00:46:26,542 --> 00:46:29,234
He was a long-distance
runner in high school.

463
00:46:29,338 --> 00:46:30,201
Damn!

464
00:46:30,304 --> 00:46:31,616
Damn!

465
00:46:31,719 --> 00:46:32,548
Give me those keys, quickly.

466
00:46:32,651 --> 00:46:33,342
Here, take this.

467
00:46:37,829 --> 00:46:39,866
There's something
around us, Warden!

468
00:46:39,969 --> 00:46:41,177
You back off.

469
00:46:41,281 --> 00:46:42,696
And keep your-- keep your
flashlight on the compound.

470
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,973
Yes, sir.

471
00:46:44,077 --> 00:46:45,664
What's this about Bradock,
Donovan, and-- and Coler?

472
00:46:45,768 --> 00:46:46,458
Now, look.

473
00:46:46,562 --> 00:46:47,977
I'm gonna unchain you men.

474
00:46:48,081 --> 00:46:50,393
I want you to run to
the generator plant,

475
00:46:50,497 --> 00:46:52,499
and I want you to remain there.

476
00:46:52,602 --> 00:46:53,914
Remain there with
the rest of them.

The warden's dead.

480
00:47:26,913 --> 00:47:28,086
Help me carry him to his room.

481
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:29,087
Yeah.

482
00:47:29,191 --> 00:47:29,881
Yeah.

484
00:47:54,112 --> 00:47:55,010
Quick, get in here.

485
00:47:55,113 --> 00:47:58,461
Get in here.

486
00:47:58,565 --> 00:47:59,462
Come on, move it.

00:48:10,025 --> 00:48:12,890

Oh!

490
00:48:49,409 --> 00:48:51,238
Help me get him to
the couch, please.

491
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:00,868
We can't stay here, Doctor.

492
00:49:00,972 --> 00:49:01,973
Why not, Jablonski?

493
00:49:02,077 --> 00:49:03,733
Because these old walls
won't keep them out.

494
00:49:03,837 --> 00:49:05,873
You'd better let
Johnson rest for awhile.

495
00:49:15,469 --> 00:49:17,989
Sorry for what I
said the other day.

496
00:49:18,093 --> 00:49:24,444
So am I.

that light down

and put it in the power plant!

501
00:49:50,573 --> 00:49:52,817
Let's shine it on the
front door over here.

502
00:50:00,652 --> 00:50:03,069
They won't go near the
beam of that light.

503
00:50:03,172 --> 00:50:05,933
Decomposes them
almost instantly.

504
00:50:06,037 --> 00:50:07,452
Give us some protection
while we're walking

505
00:50:07,556 --> 00:50:10,145
over to that generator plant.

506
00:50:10,248 --> 00:50:12,078
We'll be safe then.

507
00:50:36,757 --> 00:50:40,451
Sergeant Burns, get out there
and cover the guards while

508
00:50:40,554 --> 00:50:41,693
they're getting the light down.

509

510
00:50:42,798 --> 00:50:43,661
Wait a minute.

511
00:50:48,735 --> 00:50:49,598
You help too.

512
00:51:23,390 --> 00:51:24,840
Just about.

513
00:51:24,943 --> 00:51:26,359
I got it.

514
00:51:26,462 --> 00:51:27,325

They had their chance,
but they didn't harm you.

They-- they just stared at you.

529
00:54:29,231 --> 00:54:30,336
Oh, they'd've
harmed her soon as--

530
00:54:30,439 --> 00:54:32,441
How the hell you know that?

531
00:54:32,545 --> 00:54:36,721
Because I had to listen to
their stories every night.

532
00:54:36,825 --> 00:54:39,655
How they'd look at
her by the fence.

533
00:54:39,759 --> 00:54:43,970
Then they'd tell me how
they'd like to touch her.

534
00:54:44,073 --> 00:54:46,317
But first they'd've looked.

535
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:53,082
Carol, listen to me.

536
00:54:53,186 --> 00:54:55,119
