1
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:05,792
<i>"SKINNY SKINNY"</i>

2
00:01:05,912 --> 00:01:09,222
<i>What's wrong, Giacomino?
You are not in the usual mood.</i>

3
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:13,511
<i>Of course, I don't want to spend
another day on an empty stomach.</i>

4
00:01:13,631 --> 00:01:16,845
<i>Okay, we'll purvey for. We will.</i>

5
00:01:17,276 --> 00:01:23,395
"We'll purvey for"...You always say so,
but I feel weak, weak!

6
00:01:23,515 --> 00:01:27,820
It's a matter of vitamin!
Phosphates! Phosphates!

7
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,269
Not phosphates...steaks!

8
00:01:30,474 --> 00:01:32,556
You're right! You're right!

9
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,602
You were always a bit anemic.

10
00:01:35,817 --> 00:01:39,065
But tonight we'll work,
and we'll get paid, God willing.

11
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:44,871
But who can get until tonight!
I have too much arrear appetite!

12
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,875
I got her! I got her!

13
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:11,054
The hen belongs to me!
She belongs to us!...To us!

14
00:02:11,994 --> 00:02:15,274
Yes, she belongs to us. How's she?

15
00:02:16,822 --> 00:02:18,836
She is a false lean!

16
00:02:19,785 --> 00:02:21,876
How do we cook her?

17
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,711
Roasted!
- Bravo, I'm crazy for roasted chicken!

18
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:29,532
Love, love!
- And the fire?

19
00:02:29,821 --> 00:02:32,645
Right, the fire!
We'll put her at the sun!

20
00:02:32,818 --> 00:02:36,394
Bravo! Twenty days at the beach!
- Don't joke!

21
00:02:36,612 --> 00:02:39,472
I'm not kidding!
- Meanwhile, let's kill her.

22
00:02:42,023 --> 00:02:45,054
Ouch!
- What happens? Did she bite?

23
00:02:45,314 --> 00:02:46,258
No!

24
00:02:48,429 --> 00:02:51,999
We're not experienced.
Let's call the concierge!

25
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,232
Shall I go down?
- No, I'll call her in the courtyard.

26
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,796
Mrs. Rosa!

27
00:03:01,628 --> 00:03:03,951
Mrs. Rosa !
<i>What do you want?</i>

28
00:03:05,568 --> 00:03:08,605
Be patient, come up a moment.

29
00:03:09,036 --> 00:03:11,390
<i>Is it urgent?</i>

30
00:03:11,684 --> 00:03:15,207
Quite. Come up, Mrs. Rosa, come up!

31
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,396
Are you hurt?

32
00:03:21,912 --> 00:03:26,514
Much? I think the nail will fall.
But, it is fine!

33
00:03:26,574 --> 00:03:30,625
That's the one! - And why give me this?
- 'Cause, I had it in my mouth!

34
00:03:33,545 --> 00:03:35,267
Here's the Executioner!

35
00:03:36,114 --> 00:03:37,599
Mrs. Rosa.

36
00:03:38,206 --> 00:03:41,639
Come in.
Here is our Mrs. Rosa!

37
00:03:41,865 --> 00:03:45,841
Here is the chair.
Mrs. Rosa, you must do us a big favor.

38
00:03:45,961 --> 00:03:50,360
Let me be, don't speak of favors!
Just today I'm very nervous!

39
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,480
What happened? - Someone stole
a white chicken that was a beauty!

40
00:03:57,416 --> 00:04:00,791
But this is the voice of my chicken!
- No...

41
00:04:01,255 --> 00:04:04,927
But, there's my chicken here?
- No. .. no!

42
00:04:05,205 --> 00:04:10,294
It's my companion,
he's practicing for a great variety act.

43
00:04:11,037 --> 00:04:14,454
He imitates animal sounds.
Let us hear the chicken sound.

44
00:04:18,186 --> 00:04:22,415
Forget it! Don't let him do the
chicken sound. - Yeah, it's nostalgic.

45
00:04:22,653 --> 00:04:25,875
Well, tell me, what did you call me for?

46
00:04:27,089 --> 00:04:30,173
Ah ... us?
- Yes, you called me, right?

47
00:04:30,405 --> 00:04:32,421
So?
- Well...

48
00:04:34,185 --> 00:04:36,479
We wanted to know the time.
- What?

49
00:04:36,566 --> 00:04:39,869
And, to know the time, you made me do
five flights of stairs? - Sorry.

50
00:04:39,929 --> 00:04:44,719
Are you crazy? I've always said it,
the artists are all idiots!

51
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,596
Sorry, Mrs. Rosa.

52
00:04:50,221 --> 00:04:53,193
This has to die!
- It's a sin, poor beast!

53
00:04:53,253 --> 00:04:55,172
By the way, professor...

54
00:05:01,324 --> 00:05:04,000
No, you have to do...

55
00:05:11,794 --> 00:05:15,254
<i>Professor, stop doing the beasts!</i>
- Sit down.

56
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:20,453
No need, no need. I wanted to tell you,
this morning came the administrator.

57
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,033
He wants the rent!

58
00:05:22,311 --> 00:05:25,600
What manners!
After all, he must only have two months!

59
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:30,189
And it's 2 months you're here! And never
paid. - Already 2 months have passed?!

60
00:05:30,269 --> 00:05:34,966
You know, months run! - They run?
Well, we cannot run behind the months!

61
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:36,213
Silence!

62
00:05:45,525 --> 00:05:46,691
Studies later!

63
00:05:47,619 --> 00:05:48,751
Mrs. Rosa,..

64
00:05:49,488 --> 00:05:53,685
tell the landlord
that tonight we debut at the Alcazar.

65
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,090
Come tomorrow and
I'll give you something for him. - Okay.

66
00:05:58,244 --> 00:06:00,345
Think about it, he's a bad guy!

67
00:06:00,405 --> 00:06:03,832
A guy who would throw
your furniture in the street! - What?

68
00:06:03,892 --> 00:06:05,618
And then he kicks you out!

69
00:06:05,678 --> 00:06:09,335
Mrs. Rosa, you are responsible!
These are all antiques!

70
00:06:09,671 --> 00:06:12,309
<i>I'll sue the landlord...
I'll seize the whole building!</i>

71
00:06:12,369 --> 00:06:15,682
The furniture, in the street!
- Oh! Why?

72
00:06:16,014 --> 00:06:19,031
The rent!  - Oh!
- Money!

73
00:06:25,006 --> 00:06:27,535
I would say, eat her alive, poor beast!

74
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:32,850
Do not be silly, stupid!
Scary, huh!

75
00:06:34,011 --> 00:06:37,693
Mrs. Rosa! - Mrs. Rosa, again!
Put her here!

76
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,159
Pardon!
But Professor Sik Sik, lives here?

77
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,411
It's me, the renowned professor!
Who is she?

78
00:06:51,467 --> 00:06:55,400
Miss!
Sit down, young lady!

79
00:06:55,682 --> 00:07:01,081
Please come in.
Professor, let me introduce Miss Lilì.

80
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:05,320
She is your partner. I met her
last night at the Cafe of the Artists.

81
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,614
She's jobless
since three months, and I,..

82
00:07:07,734 --> 00:07:10,636
I have engaged her
for three shows a day,..

83
00:07:10,727 --> 00:07:13,680
at 15 lire, and no down payment!

84
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,880
But I came just for the down payment!

85
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,713
A chair for the young lady.
- Sure.

86
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:23,121
Good! Just what we needed!
- She's cute, right?

87
00:07:26,017 --> 00:07:28,161
What the hell are you doing?

88
00:07:28,667 --> 00:07:33,313
I've said many times, this is the chair
for the landlord! - How should I know?

89
00:07:33,433 --> 00:07:39,158
I am mortified...did you get hurt? Sit.
This is a good chair. - No, thanks,..

90
00:07:39,453 --> 00:07:43,643
I prefer standing.
- Of course! What humiliation!

91
00:07:44,712 --> 00:07:48,880
Can we offer you something?
Certainly you have already eaten.

92
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,930
Actually ... no.
- Us neither!

93
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:57,500
But of course! As you see,
even abroad they have the same habits.

94
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,740
Artists eat after the show.

95
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,900
Tonight, let's hope that all is well...
so, God willing, we too will eat.

96
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,220
Let's hope He's willing!

97
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,700
Depends on you!
- On me?

98
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,740
Of course.
- And why?

99
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,100
You told the lady what to do?
- Everything!

100
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:23,100
What I recommend,
is the disappearance of the dove!

101
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:27,460
The dove?
- Which then should be in your hat.

102
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,273
Remember to sit in the front row.

103
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,860
So that, when I say:

104
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:37,980
Is there someone of the audience
who wants to come on stage, gentlemen?

105
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:41,112
You answer immediately: "I WONT!"

106
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,271
Yes.
I WONT!

107
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,556
WONT?

108
00:08:46,523 --> 00:08:49,830
I WENT.
- I WENT.

109
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,953
WONT?
- WENT?

110
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:58,500
WONT?
- WONT? But...

111
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,180
Okay, you will just say..

112
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,460
I !

113
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,397
I!
- Bravo!

114
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,188
I wish the show started right now!

115
00:09:08,991 --> 00:09:12,990
You'll have a perfect partner!
- Shall we rehearse?

116
00:09:13,128 --> 00:09:14,967
OK, let's rehearse.

117
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:20,860
Ladies and Gentlemen,
military and children!

118
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:25,311
<i>By now, all over the world,
is known my great fame as magician!</i>

119
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,860
<i>The Sik Sik who has amazed the world,..</i>

120
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,419
tonight is finally in your presence.

121
00:09:32,901 --> 00:09:35,266
My life has been almost fabulous!

122
00:09:35,326 --> 00:09:39,884
I was only 7 when, at home,
I already made disappear any thing!

123
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,260
Mademoiselle, please.

124
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,820
Mademoiselle!

125
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,051
Japan welcomed my 12 years of age.

126
00:09:47,196 --> 00:09:50,442
At 13,
kissed me in front the sun of URIENT.

127
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:56,073
This evening, here, I will perform
experiments the most very famous!

128
00:09:56,277 --> 00:10:00,460
Beginning by that of the glasses.
Mademoiselle! Please Maestro, music!

129
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,100
Excuse me, you have a match?
- No, I don't buy matches.

130
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,754
What do you have in your hat?

131
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,316
A pigeon.

132
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,156
Holy Virgin!

133
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,100
Why?
I'm ruined!

134
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,060
What's with you?
- Miss, you have been my ruin!

135
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,918
You are rude!
- I dislike you!

136
00:10:46,532 --> 00:10:47,882
Hey!

137
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,275
But what are you saying? Imbecile!

138
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:08,511
Go into the hall, stupid!
You're ruining everything!

139
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,558
Attention, s'il vous plaît!
Maestro, please.

140
00:11:24,359 --> 00:11:28,831
We have two glasses.
You can consult your clocks.

141
00:11:29,034 --> 00:11:33,124
In under a second, the wine
will end up in the glass of water,..

142
00:11:33,288 --> 00:11:36,590
and the water
in the stomach of the young lady.

143
00:11:36,933 --> 00:11:38,550
One!

144
00:11:39,311 --> 00:11:40,236
Two!

145
00:11:40,296 --> 00:11:42,516
Three!

146
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,237
We are now at a second experiment!

147
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,597
A sensational experiment!
Unique in the world!

148
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:07,065
The disappearance of a pigeon,..

149
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:10,430
which then
will be found in the hat of a spectator.

150
00:12:10,937 --> 00:12:13,870
Mademoiselle,
thank this esteemed audience!

151
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,400
Come here! Hush!

152
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:51,460
To perform this experiment,
I need someone from the audience..

153
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,740
who comes on stage to check!

154
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,740
Is there someone of the audience
who wants to come on stage, gentlemen?

155
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,756
I!
- I'll come!

156
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,397
No, I wanted Giacomino...Gia...

157
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:08,380
One moment!
Before performing the experiment,..

158
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,620
I want you to note
that the pidgeon is without trick!

159
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,140
And that it stays alive for a lifetime!

160
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,860
Mademoiselle, show the pidgeon.

161
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:22,080
<i>We want to see the dove!
- The pidgeon!</i>

162
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,399
<i>Watch, don't touch!</i>

163
00:13:37,271 --> 00:13:38,996
Oh...why?

164
00:13:39,521 --> 00:13:41,500
<i>Please watch!</i>

165
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:45,508
Hurry! We're waiting from three hours
to see the experiment!

166
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:50,653
Is there someone coming on stage?
Is there someone coming on stage?

167
00:13:50,713 --> 00:13:53,625
Is there someone coming on stage?
- I'll come!

168
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:54,820
Come! Come!

169
00:14:01,477 --> 00:14:04,050
Come!
Were you sleeping?

170
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,327
No, I was looking for!

171
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:10,366
Please, come on in.
Careful, you will break your head!

172
00:14:10,945 --> 00:14:12,158
Be careful.

173
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:14,471
<i>You are very clever!</i>

174
00:14:17,533 --> 00:14:19,210
I take this pidgeon...

175
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,839
Chicken.

176
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:28,100
I take this pidgeon...
- Chicken.

177
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,438
I take this pidgeon... <i>- Chicken!</i>
I slam it on your face!

178
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:38,220
I'm going to put it in a cage...
That is, if you let me do this game!

179
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,748
If you want to understand me! Huh?

180
00:14:42,143 --> 00:14:43,387
One...

181
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,967
Two...

182
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,186
Three!

183
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,109
Maestro, stop the music.

184
00:14:52,222 --> 00:14:56,483
The pigeon that was in that cage,
gentlemen, I made it disappear!

185
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:00,180
And I made it appear
under the hat of this gentleman!

186
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,694
Show the pigeon!

187
00:15:01,754 --> 00:15:06,890
And I'd say...let's show a chicken!
- And I have done disappear a pigeon!

188
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:09,979
To each his own!

189
00:15:10,381 --> 00:15:13,038
Chicken !
- Pigeon ! - Chicken !

190
00:15:14,148 --> 00:15:17,950
The pigeon ran away,
this is chicken!

191
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:22,344
One moment!

192
00:15:22,926 --> 00:15:27,660
The pigeon that was in the cage,
I made find it  in the gentleman's hat..

193
00:15:28,055 --> 00:15:30,670
and I made it become chicken!

194
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,920
Down the curtain!

195
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,835
Go get my hat.

196
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,913
I can't.
- Why?

197
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,516
There's the impresario right there.

198
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,596
Are you happy?

199
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,356
All your fault!

200
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,914
Goodbye contract, goodbye lunch,
farewell all!

201
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,076
But you have it in for me?
- Yes!

202
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,753
But I did tell you it was chicken!

203
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,940
Pigeon!
- It was chicken!

204
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,380
<i>Pigeon! - Chicken!
- Hands off!</i>

205
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:18,274
Lazybones!
- Lazybones, no!

206
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:33,980
I realize that intimacy
raises discontent and discord.

207
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:38,100
And since one does not respect
one's fellow artist,..

208
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,140
it is best to separate. Tomorrow,
you will receive two of my friends.

209
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,700
Mr. Sik, but the contract, the money?

210
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,380
What contract?

211
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,700
The money!
- The money?

212
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:56,471
The contract is ended, and you saw how.
What money? There is no money!

213
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,596
And..

214
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:03,072
then, mademoiselle, you're
perfectly right, but it is not my fault!

215
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,076
It's because of this idiot!

216
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,460
Yes, but the idiot gave me the contract.

217
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,940
The idiot gave you the contract?
- Yes, the idiot.

218
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,755
Enough!
I take full responsibility!

219
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,900
Miss,
starting tomorrow you will eat with us.

220
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,918
Where there's enough for two,
there's enough for three!

221
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,380
It is about a real fortune!
A casket full of gold coins!

222
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,830
Gold coins?
- Yes, gold!

223
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:39,180
In the Villa Belvedere,
near the main gate,..

224
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,180
there is a large oak.

225
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:45,540
<i>Under this oak
is buried the treasure chest.</i>

226
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,700
<i>Just dig a meter and a half!</i>

227
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,340
<i>The house is unattended,
there are no dogs!</i>

228
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:58,430
<i>So, there is no danger of being caught,
just dig a meter and a half!</i>

229
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:05,758
<i>Do you understand? This is what
my grandfather told me in a dream!</i>

230
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,878
But the villa really exists,
I know it well!

231
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,396
<i>What do you do?</i>

232
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,275
We were picking some fresh salad.

233
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:12,238
What do you do?
- Same as you are doing.

234
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,796
You too?
- Yes, us too.

235
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,271
Then let's go.
- Where? It is here.

236
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,800
Under the oak.
- What? - The Treasure.

237
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,460
The treasure? Not here any more!

238
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,820
Oh, why?
- I have it, the treasure!

239
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:38,192
You already dug it yourself?
- Yes. I will give it to you.

240
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,919
You to us? - Yes, come with me.
- To us? - Come. - The family gold?

241
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:56,752
Sir?

242
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:04,080
<i>Are you hurt?
- No, I'm fine.</i>

243
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,380
Who is this?
- A fellow worker.

244
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:16,513
I like her.
We'll take her along with us.

245
00:21:20,135 --> 00:21:21,313
Taxi!

246
00:21:21,523 --> 00:21:23,556
We go by taxi!

247
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,189
<i>Please.</i>

248
00:21:25,892 --> 00:21:27,377
Please get in.

249
00:21:34,397 --> 00:21:38,330
But, listen, us too, right?
- Of course, get in.

250
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,796
Get in.

251
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,100
Did you find him?
- No!

252
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,380
Not even at the second floor?
- No.

253
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,260
Professor, the 22 has escaped!
- It isn't possible! He couldn't!

254
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,437
Well, he fled!
- Then look everywhere, and let me know!

255
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,078
You did not expect me, right?
- No!

256
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,517
You did the master until now, huh?

257
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,676
Come in, please. Come in.

258
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,420
<i>Don't make compliments, come forward.</i>

259
00:22:21,697 --> 00:22:24,916
Miss, please.

260
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:32,078
These are three great friends of mine.

261
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:38,500
Poor boy!
I beg your pardon, I'll be right back.

262
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:42,780
I want to fix you
a really delicious dinner.

263
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:47,100
Outstanding! Please, that way.

264
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,116
There?
- There.

265
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:55,553
What an amiable fellow! He's amiable!

266
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,110
Me too?
- Of course.

267
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,756
Thank you.
- You are welcome.

268
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,756
Giovanni !

269
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,060
Off you go, in the kitchen!
- Yes.

270
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,076
Come on.

271
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,740
Just a little time!
- For me, any time.

272
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,020
For me too!

273
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,674
Who is that gentleman?
- Who knows!

274
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,501
What a gentleman!
- Great gentleman!

275
00:23:31,966 --> 00:23:33,200
I'm hungry!

276
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,957
You know who doesn't persuade me?

277
00:23:36,828 --> 00:23:39,431
Who?
- The manservant.

278
00:23:39,491 --> 00:23:41,700
He's...strange.

279
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,623
Bravo!
I meant to say it. He's strange.

280
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,510
Please.

281
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,516
Master, it cuts.

282
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,636
I like it!

283
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,519
What a gentleman!
- What a great gentleman!

284
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,940
What manners!
- What kindness!

285
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,030
The real gentleman!
- Yes.

286
00:24:10,227 --> 00:24:11,669
Amiable.

287
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,636
But where is the kitchen?

288
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,076
The kitchen is there.

289
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,436
At table!
- At table!

290
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,700
It's the phone!
- Doesn't concern us.

291
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,799
During my absence...
you treat yourself well!

292
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,860
A small little chicken.
- Small little chicken, huh ?

293
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,980
Let's prepare dinner.

294
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,679
It's stubborn!

295
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:54,471
I'll answer, it's the same.
We are friends.

296
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,100
Hello?
- I speak with villa Gerbi?

297
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,900
CERVI ? Who's he!?

298
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,919
Mr. Gerbi is at home?
- Oh! Gerbi!

299
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,660
Don't know him either, but I'm going
to call him, let's see if he's here.

300
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,900
No! Do not move,
do not call, God forbid!

301
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,980
This thing is very serious!
You speak with Villa Belvedere!

302
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:25,140
Belvedere ?
- Belvedere! The villa of the treasure!

303
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,078
Oh, the treasure!

304
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:32,740
No, I wasn't talking to you.
Say, say...say.

305
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,700
From our private clinic,
a while ago, has escaped a madman.

306
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,716
And you're telling me?

307
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:42,500
We do not care!
Leave us alone, we must go for dinner!

308
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:46,820
We think he has taken refuge there,
in his villa. - The villa where we are?

309
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,836
He fled in his pajamas!

310
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:54,020
He had a monocle?
- What happened?

311
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,390
That gentleman who invited us to dinner,
he's fool!

312
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,260
Oh! That great gentleman?

313
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,232
Yeah!
- But why?

314
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:09,260
Mr. Gerbi is a dangerous lunatic,
suffering from homicidal mania!

315
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,550
Ma... ma... mania...homicidal?

316
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,636
He kills people?

317
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,314
He kills people!

318
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:20,001
Hey!

319
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,420
Oh! Dinner ready? Let's go!

320
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,870
No, the cemetery!
All three of us!

321
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:29,636
<i>Immediately, send the keepers,
well equipped,..</i>

322
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:33,073
and take him away!
Send for the men in white!

323
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,036
Let's go! Let's go, quick!

324
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:42,276
Prepare, prepare...
Quick, Giovanni, quick.

325
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:55,154
And now,
before the food touches your lips,..

326
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,358
I want to tell you a story.

327
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,236
To us?
-To you.

328
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:05,999
Is it necessary?
- It's necessary. Please sit down.

329
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,317
Please, sit down.

330
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,236
And dinner?

331
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:20,709
A tale about two bad friends,
who wanted to betray me.

332
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:27,100
I opened them my house,
and I invited them to my table.

333
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:33,190
I had treated the food so that
it would be delicious and plentiful.

334
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:37,980
But the little devil
that is inside the phone...

335
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:42,260
There's also the little devil?
- An evil little devil, he called them!

336
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:47,997
It is very bad to listen
to the little devil inside the phone.

337
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:56,380
I always carry this,
for the little devil inside the phone.

338
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,460
We must cut the throat!
- To the little devil?

339
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:04,274
To who talks
to the little devil inside the phone!

340
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,870
My poor friends!

341
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:14,182
What an ugly end!
- Lunch is served.

342
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:15,839
Great!

343
00:28:18,088 --> 00:28:23,035
Come on, quick, at the table!
Come on, come on!

344
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:26,880
Come on, come on!

345
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:33,232
Sit down. Turn off the light!
- Right away!

346
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,956
What a beautiful tableful!

347
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:43,715
<i>Did you see Giovanni, my valet?
Poor thing!</i>

348
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,346
That mark, I made it myself.
Like this!

349
00:28:52,645 --> 00:28:54,397
Good.

350
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,996
Now comes the fun.

351
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,756
Ladies first.

352
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,070
Giovanni, take away.

353
00:29:35,854 --> 00:29:36,798
Eat.

354
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,116
<i>Silence!</i>

355
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:45,470
Eat!

356
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,076
Enjoy your meal.

357
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,273
Thank you.
- Thank you.

358
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:39,314
No talking...with the little devil!

359
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,240
My friends do not eat?

360
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,436
<i>What is it!</i>

361
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,596
Too much sauce.

362
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,390
<i>Enough!...with spaghetti!</i>

363
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,460
Now, chicken!

364
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,580
Thank goodness!

365
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,200
<i>Giovanni, remove the dishes.</i>

366
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:20,596
<i>Not those! These!</i>

367
00:31:22,585 --> 00:31:24,590
What a darling!

368
00:31:26,769 --> 00:31:28,167
There.

369
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,636
I adore chicken!

370
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,194
<i>Giovanni, take away!</i>

371
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:46,997
<i>It is delicious. Delicious.</i>

372
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:51,277
Eat the chicken!
- Eat!

373
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:55,078
If the man says eat...eat!

374
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,540
What are you doing?

375
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,600
It will be a boy.

376
00:32:29,395 --> 00:32:32,498
Drink, drink!

377
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,658
My dear, drink!

378
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:38,360
 Drink!
- Ah!

379
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,596
What is it?

380
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,593
It's here! Come on!

381
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,836
Tie him!

382
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,916
The little devil!

383
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:38,874
Hold him!
- Leave me alone!

384
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,918
Mademoiselle! Mademoiselle!

385
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,116
Ahi! Ahi!

386
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,436
What a beautiful day today!

387
00:35:03,856 --> 00:35:05,234
What day is it?

388
00:35:06,371 --> 00:35:07,392
Thursday.

389
00:35:09,044 --> 00:35:13,276
And when we last ate?
<i>- Who can remember!</i>

390
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,830
Monday, I think...yes, Monday.

391
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:22,433
We must find a remedy soon.

392
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,180
Otherwise we will end up
like Count Ugolino.

393
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,100
Who is Ugolino?

394
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:32,980
Ugolino was the one
who ate his children. - Oh! Why?

395
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,660
Why? Because he was hungry!

396
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,756
He was hungry.

397
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:51,620
And now that our family
has grown by two heads,..

398
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,820
the girl and the hen,..

399
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,836
we are better off than before!

400
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,833
We'll have to work!

401
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,001
Work!

402
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:05,629
Today we have serious responsibilities.

403
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:10,020
And then,
remember that work ennobles man.

404
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,638
So, we shall work, pal!

405
00:36:13,112 --> 00:36:15,113
MANUAL WORKERS WANTED

406
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,058
# Alone!

407
00:36:45,822 --> 00:36:49,540
# Alone at the top floor,

408
00:36:49,821 --> 00:36:53,570
all speaks of love
when the sky is clear,

409
00:36:53,908 --> 00:36:57,436
and the heart in turmoil. #

410
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,270
<i>Miss!
Miss, what are you doing?</i>

411
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,330
<i>Miss, you can get hurt!</i>

412
00:37:35,422 --> 00:37:37,408
Wait Miss, I'll go.

413
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,180
Here it is!
You have a hen with suicidal tendencies.

414
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,460
What?
- Oh, French?

415
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:01,500
Yes, but I understand Italian.
- Well then, let me introduce myself:

416
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,460
Mario Sergi, violinist.
- Lilì, artist.

417
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:08,300
Artist?
So certainly you live by yourself.

418
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:12,069
No, I live with mum and dad.
- Oh, Mom and Dad?

419
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:16,060
And now that we arrived
in the countryside, what do we do?

420
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,076
We'll go back in town.

421
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:28,557
Imbecile!
- He's ruined our clothes!

422
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,700
Leave him alone!
- You don't mess with clothes!

423
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,718
We are weak.
- Yes, we are weak!

424
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:48,312
All right!
One mustn't drive like that!

425
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:58,020
Want to eat?
- And you ask?

426
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:01,700
Deflate it. - What?
- I'll see to it! Deflate the tire.

427
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,460
And why?
- Why why? Deflate it! Unscrew the cap.

428
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,398
This, this!
- This here? - Yes, good.

429
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,308
May I?
- Quick!

430
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,592
Sir, you have a flat tire.

431
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,260
Possible?
- We deflated it ourselves!

432
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,620
We noticed it.
We were sitting there.

433
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:48,900
Damn! Another waste of time! - Don't
worry, sir. We'll change it in 2 minutes.

434
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,191
Can you?
- We are mechanics, right? - No!

435
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:56,060
Yes! Yes! - So, hurry up,
I'll make you a nice gift!

436
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:59,740
Thanks! - Thanks!
- Where is the tire? - Behind!

437
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:03,509
Where? - Behind!
- Come, unscrew the tire.

438
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:08,780
This is the tire!
- No, the spare one first!

439
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,980
But that's the flat one!
- What a brilliant idea, huh?

440
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,780
What a great idea!

441
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,420
At last we can eat!
- Sure!

442
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,711
He'll make us a nice gift,
he's a gentleman! - At least 5 lire!

443
00:40:26,283 --> 00:40:30,055
We've got you!
That will teach you to steal cars!

444
00:40:30,115 --> 00:40:32,580
<i>We are honest men!
- We are innocent!</i>

445
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:37,510
Come to the Commissioner!
- Ask the owner of the car!

446
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:43,215
Miss, will seem strange,
but I've seen your parents.

447
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:44,974
Impossible! - Yes!

448
00:40:45,034 --> 00:40:48,754
Daddy's got long mustache,
and mama's got short ones.

449
00:40:49,014 --> 00:40:51,944
Funny! Have anything else to say?
- Yes.

450
00:40:52,076 --> 00:40:55,653
Then I want to tell you that...
it's a beautiful day today!

451
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:59,851
Not too bad.
- We could go for a stroll together.

452
00:41:00,449 --> 00:41:02,053
You and me?
- Sure.

453
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:04,300
<i>Silence I said, silence!</i>

454
00:41:04,437 --> 00:41:07,820
What silence! I'm an artist!
- And I, his gaffer!

455
00:41:08,003 --> 00:41:10,949
We are gentlemen!
- Great gentlemen!

456
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:21,148
Nothing to say.
You got a great idea!

457
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,278
Wonderful idea! It's you, alright!

458
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,318
Look at that potato, look!

459
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:46,580
At least we eat!
- Really?!

460
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,580
Here, we eat every day?
- On the clock!

461
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:53,189
What a gentleman! - Who?
- The King!

462
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,836
Thank you.

463
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,276
See you tomorrow!

464
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,128
<i>You! Let's go to the commissioner!</i>

465
00:42:11,188 --> 00:42:13,261
Now?
- We are at lunch.

466
00:42:13,321 --> 00:42:14,615
<i>Hurry, come!</i>

467
00:42:14,675 --> 00:42:17,950
Tell him to wait 2 minutes,
we eat and we come.

468
00:42:18,236 --> 00:42:21,693
I told you that
the Commissioner wants you, hurry up!

469
00:42:22,443 --> 00:42:25,893
The commissioner
can not wait for your convenience!

470
00:42:26,281 --> 00:42:29,944
We need to eat! - We need to eat!
- Let's go, go!

471
00:42:30,412 --> 00:42:33,710
What arrogance!
- We need to eat!

472
00:42:35,167 --> 00:42:38,368
<i>The two prisoners.</i> - Come in.
Come in!

473
00:42:38,428 --> 00:42:40,485
<i>'Morning!
- Servant, excellency.</i>

474
00:42:40,545 --> 00:42:42,423
Hats away!
Hats off!

475
00:42:42,483 --> 00:42:43,710
The hat!

476
00:42:45,239 --> 00:42:47,595
The real car thief was arrested.

477
00:42:48,266 --> 00:42:51,190
Your innocence is recognized.
You are free.

478
00:42:51,552 --> 00:42:54,588
Oh, why?
- But, right now?

479
00:42:55,071 --> 00:42:56,192
<i>Yes, right now!</i>

480
00:42:57,084 --> 00:43:01,666
Excellency, before taking such
an important decision, say vital,..

481
00:43:02,398 --> 00:43:05,060
wouldn't it be better to wait 10 minutes?

482
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,950
We go in the cell.
If you want us, just call.

483
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:13,098
No waiting in cell.
You are innocent, so go. Go!

484
00:43:13,575 --> 00:43:15,455
"Go!", "Go!"

485
00:43:16,919 --> 00:43:21,707
"Go!"...and the soup is gone!
- It's gone, all right!

486
00:43:22,828 --> 00:43:26,109
A bit of gaiety!
Be a little cheerful!

487
00:43:26,279 --> 00:43:31,300
I begin to believe you mean bad luck!
- Don't start with this! - That's right!

488
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,680
You're my bad luck.

489
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,960
Don't repeat these things,
no joking!

490
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:44,781
No, I speak seriously.
- On this subject, you cannot joke!

491
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:49,175
No joking, really.
- Where did you get that?

492
00:43:50,202 --> 00:43:52,718
A piece of loaf that I managed to save.

493
00:43:58,274 --> 00:44:00,166
Come with me.
- Why?

494
00:44:00,451 --> 00:44:04,425
Put the bread in your pocket, you idiot!
- And why? - Come with me.

495
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,493
Here, some cheese.

496
00:44:11,054 --> 00:44:12,060
Boss!

497
00:44:13,885 --> 00:44:15,514
Wrap it, please.

498
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,920
There.
- Thanks. - You're welcome.

499
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:26,237
5 lire.
- 5 lire.

500
00:44:27,408 --> 00:44:32,208
And,...sardines cost the same?
- Yes, 5 lire.

501
00:44:33,136 --> 00:44:35,998
Would you like sardines?
- Yes, sardines.

502
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:41,276
Would you kindly give me the sardines?
- In place of this? - Yes

503
00:44:47,146 --> 00:44:50,749
Here are the sardines. They're delicious.
- I believe it!

504
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,600
Thank you and goodbye.
- Excuse me!

505
00:44:53,673 --> 00:44:55,495
Say.
- You haven't paid.

506
00:44:55,555 --> 00:44:57,047
What?
- The sardines.

507
00:44:57,167 --> 00:44:59,840
But I gave in return a box of cheese.

508
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:05,189
But you had not paid for the cheese.
- But the cheese, I did not take it.

509
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:09,027
Right! - Clear?
- Yes. - Goodbye.

510
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:23,044
<i>The greatest attraction in Europe!
The ride of death...</i>

511
00:45:23,104 --> 00:45:26,949
Excuse me, we're both artists.
- What do you want?

512
00:45:27,023 --> 00:45:30,120
We would like to work.
- A small job, if any.

513
00:45:30,193 --> 00:45:34,286
Here there's no jobs, is fully occupied.
Go to the rides, there are jobs, there.

514
00:45:34,346 --> 00:45:36,975
Got jobs? Seeking staff?
- Yes, porters.

515
00:45:37,035 --> 00:45:42,228
I told you "at the rides", I told you!
- Go! - Thanks. - Thanks!

516
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:46,585
Excuse me. - Go, that way.
- That way? - Yes

517
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:51,313
Gentlemen, the last performance
of the death ride...

518
00:45:55,492 --> 00:46:02,257
Around the world for 50 cents! Pay now,
so later there will be no quarrels...

519
00:46:21,258 --> 00:46:22,640
Money in hand!

520
00:46:29,005 --> 00:46:30,422
Take it easy!

521
00:46:35,202 --> 00:46:36,590
But what the...

522
00:46:41,493 --> 00:46:43,748
I'll take your balls away!

523
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:11,432
Who's there?

524
00:47:22,114 --> 00:47:23,618
But, who is it?

525
00:47:26,957 --> 00:47:28,422
Oh, it's you!

526
00:48:05,218 --> 00:48:09,167
# Pe, pe, pe, pè... !

527
00:48:13,527 --> 00:48:15,275
Za, zam... ! #

528
00:48:24,496 --> 00:48:26,495
Mademoiselle, attention!

529
00:48:26,956 --> 00:48:28,264
One, two...

530
00:48:28,751 --> 00:48:30,547
And three!
- Thank you!

531
00:48:30,997 --> 00:48:32,626
Attention, please!

532
00:48:33,134 --> 00:48:35,187
Mademoiselle ! One...

533
00:48:35,988 --> 00:48:38,272
two...
and three !

534
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:42,506
Mademoiselle, here, attention!
Attention!

535
00:48:42,988 --> 00:48:45,199
One, two...and three!

536
00:48:47,038 --> 00:48:49,634
Look, mademoiselle, look!

537
00:48:50,753 --> 00:48:53,090
Bread, bananas, cheese!
- Sweets!

538
00:48:53,167 --> 00:48:56,784
All for me?
- For us too. - All three, all three!

539
00:48:56,904 --> 00:48:58,977
# Taratatà ! Taratatà ! #

540
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:15,568
I'll do it.
- Thanks. - There's him!

541
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:21,985
And now, mademoiselle, I want to reveal
the secret of your bright future.

542
00:49:22,247 --> 00:49:23,581
Touch a card.

543
00:49:25,508 --> 00:49:27,095
Jack of spades!

544
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:32,532
You, mademoiselle, will love
a distinguished young man, slender.

545
00:49:33,393 --> 00:49:36,583
With the soul of an artist.
- Artist? - Great artist!

546
00:49:36,669 --> 00:49:40,024
He's not rich... but will become it.

547
00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:43,083
Oh, I hope so!
- Touch another card.

548
00:49:45,139 --> 00:49:49,480
Three of clubs.
This young man has a wonderful mustache.

549
00:49:49,572 --> 00:49:54,052
Eyes of the East!
Imperious character, dynamic, hypnotic!

550
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:55,797
Voila!
Is that right?

551
00:49:55,857 --> 00:50:00,176
To me! Let me do the prediction, now!
- You? - Yes, me.

552
00:50:00,361 --> 00:50:03,160
I know you!
- And I know you!

553
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:05,533
Mademoiselle, touch a card.

554
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:09,516
Six! You, mademoiselle,..

555
00:50:09,592 --> 00:50:13,066
will love a young man
who is a phenomenon of male sympathy.

556
00:50:13,789 --> 00:50:18,739
He's very young, and his celebrity
will exceed that of his alleged master.

557
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:23,194
He doesn't have a large mustache,
but has a gentle fluff,..

558
00:50:23,537 --> 00:50:27,832
he's somewhat wasted by hunger,
but will recover and then...

559
00:50:27,892 --> 00:50:30,760
Then...You made her fall asleep.

560
00:50:31,201 --> 00:50:33,870
Oh! And why?
- Because you're boring!

561
00:50:40,415 --> 00:50:41,957
Leave it alone!

562
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:47,752
I take her to bed.
- I, take her to bed!

563
00:50:48,184 --> 00:50:49,996
Away, go away!

564
00:50:57,317 --> 00:50:58,630
Slowly, slowly.

565
00:51:23,189 --> 00:51:25,289
This situation can not continue.

566
00:51:26,796 --> 00:51:30,514
Living together
under the same roof with a woman..

567
00:51:30,984 --> 00:51:35,079
is dangerous.
- Exactly! You're right.

568
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:41,594
You understood that you're between me
and Lilì, and you're going away, right?

569
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:44,391
I?
No, you misunderstood!

570
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:47,916
You are the one going away.
- Oh, and why?

571
00:51:48,036 --> 00:51:52,057
Because I'm older,
and I have the right to stay here.

572
00:51:52,616 --> 00:51:56,713
Oh yeah? - Of course.
- You remain here because you are older..

573
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:59,656
and Lilì and I will go away.
- You and Lilì?

574
00:51:59,984 --> 00:52:04,228
Nice wedding!
Nice future for that girl!

575
00:52:04,617 --> 00:52:08,863
Remember that,
before I met you, I was a waiter!

576
00:52:09,469 --> 00:52:12,438
I am a great artist!
- I know you!

577
00:53:08,502 --> 00:53:09,802
<i>Waiter!</i>

578
00:53:11,244 --> 00:53:12,294
<i>Waiter!</i>

579
00:53:12,572 --> 00:53:16,337
You're served, sir.
Advanced payment, including the tip.

580
00:53:16,522 --> 00:53:18,305
 I say, tip!
<i>- Waiter!</i>

581
00:53:18,365 --> 00:53:22,235
Tamarind, barley water, orange juice?
- Two orange.

582
00:53:22,355 --> 00:53:26,411
- Two orange, with tip!
<i>Waiter!</i> - Yessir!

583
00:53:26,516 --> 00:53:29,853
Waiter! - I'm all yours.
- It's an hour that I call!

584
00:53:29,913 --> 00:53:32,680
Say. - What do you have?
- Me? Nothing!

585
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,741
Something cool!
- Oh! Cool!

586
00:53:34,807 --> 00:53:40,034
Ladies and gentlemen,
back from greatest success in Europe...

587
00:53:40,244 --> 00:53:45,003
Professor, be silent!
Here, you are not allowed to juggle!

588
00:53:45,262 --> 00:53:49,831
For your information,
this is no jugglery. I am performing!

589
00:53:50,252 --> 00:53:52,447
And then, please, keep your place!

590
00:53:52,507 --> 00:53:56,487
There is nothing that binds
an artist like me, and a dish washer!

591
00:53:56,691 --> 00:54:01,268
We know your jugglery by heart!
It needs a digestive!

592
00:54:01,588 --> 00:54:04,910
No, I'm not jesting,
I'll throw this box on your head!

593
00:54:05,045 --> 00:54:07,080
The box on my head?
- Yeah!

594
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:08,945
I'll be...!
You mind?

595
00:54:10,323 --> 00:54:13,481
Waiter, what the hell are you doing?
- Let go.

596
00:54:13,812 --> 00:54:16,655
When will you bring my coffee?
- Coming now.

597
00:54:16,982 --> 00:54:18,307
Let him speak!

598
00:54:18,457 --> 00:54:20,069
<i>He's a poor wretch!</i>

599
00:54:21,319 --> 00:54:24,730
Bravo! You said it: wretch!

600
00:54:24,790 --> 00:54:28,531
See? Even the gentleman
said that you are a wretch.

601
00:54:28,591 --> 00:54:32,195
Work, work! You make me waste time!
- You better go.

602
00:54:32,421 --> 00:54:33,786
Ladies, Gents...

603
00:54:33,846 --> 00:54:37,830
2 orange coffees, barley water
and an espresso vermouth. - But you say?

604
00:54:37,890 --> 00:54:41,812
Two oranges,
coffee and vermouth espresso...fast.

605
00:54:45,666 --> 00:54:48,556
Please, gentlemen, great attention!
I work for all to see!

606
00:54:48,616 --> 00:54:53,347
No tricks! I work like that...
with what I find.

607
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:08,149
If there was a bread roll now...

608
00:55:08,354 --> 00:55:11,280
<i>No bread roll?
Then, the experiment continues.</i>

609
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:14,043
One, two... and three!

610
00:55:15,479 --> 00:55:17,239
The gentleman is served.

611
00:55:17,683 --> 00:55:20,835
At home, we'll get even!
- I won't make me find!

612
00:55:24,852 --> 00:55:27,512
So, they're not your relatives.
- No.

613
00:55:29,218 --> 00:55:30,569
I told you a lie.

614
00:55:30,771 --> 00:55:36,040
But, it is not nice for a girl like you
to live with two men in the same house.

615
00:55:36,305 --> 00:55:39,235
They are two dear friends,
two gentlemen.

616
00:55:39,438 --> 00:55:44,013
I was alone, without money, homeless.
If it weren't for them...

617
00:55:45,016 --> 00:55:47,696
Listen, I'm not rich..

618
00:55:48,416 --> 00:55:52,456
but I work. I have a contract in an
orchestra that will last for a while.

619
00:55:52,576 --> 00:55:55,339
If you want, we will be happy.

620
00:55:55,679 --> 00:56:00,558
"The gentleman is served!"
I'll serve you, as you deserve!

621
00:56:03,639 --> 00:56:04,987
You too!

622
00:56:06,249 --> 00:56:08,486
Right...not your fault.

623
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:15,614
It's over, for you!
For you it's over!

624
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:28,053
What's up?

625
00:56:28,732 --> 00:56:29,764
Well...

626
00:56:31,385 --> 00:56:34,933
Look out!
A bit of room gymnastics.

627
00:56:35,592 --> 00:56:38,288
Will do well also to Giacomino!

628
00:56:38,527 --> 00:56:41,708
Of course,
gymnastics is good for everyone!

629
00:56:42,755 --> 00:56:45,666
Bravo! Bravo, Giacomino!

630
00:56:46,707 --> 00:56:49,059
A go-ahead with broken shoes!

631
00:56:49,256 --> 00:56:51,090
Beggar dishwasher!

632
00:56:51,419 --> 00:56:54,200
You are irritable, aren't you?
- What? - Nervous!

633
00:56:54,262 --> 00:56:55,282
A little.

634
00:56:58,842 --> 00:57:00,027
What beautiful flowers!

635
00:57:00,087 --> 00:57:01,427
Hello everyone!

636
00:57:05,252 --> 00:57:09,078
What beautiful flowers!
- Good morning, mademoiselle.

637
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:28,143
Excuse me, miss.
- Please.

638
00:57:35,456 --> 00:57:37,973
Change your way, young man!

639
00:57:39,979 --> 00:57:41,484
Why don't you come in?

640
00:57:43,038 --> 00:57:44,111
Ah!

641
00:57:45,078 --> 00:57:47,240
A floral gift.
- Yes.

642
00:57:49,614 --> 00:57:50,761
I see.

643
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:13,598
What a nice thought!

644
00:58:13,883 --> 00:58:17,639
As soon as I start working
I'll buy each of you a tie.

645
00:58:18,268 --> 00:58:19,312
And I...

646
00:58:20,087 --> 00:58:24,253
You, when you start working,
will buy me a beautiful dress.

647
00:58:24,512 --> 00:58:26,563
I saw it in the shop below!

648
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:31,450
It's beautiful, blue
with white polka dots. It costs...

649
01:00:53,781 --> 01:00:56,069
How does it fit me?
- Just fine.

650
01:00:56,271 --> 01:01:00,986
Do you like? - It's so beautiful!
- Are you happy? - So much!

651
01:01:05,215 --> 01:01:06,157
Lilì?

652
01:01:08,627 --> 01:01:09,561
Lilì?

653
01:01:12,971 --> 01:01:16,145
Lilì, huh ? Where is Lilì?
- I don't know.

654
01:01:17,266 --> 01:01:20,118
You don't know? - No.
- So, what are you doing here?

655
01:01:20,942 --> 01:01:23,766
Waiting for a friend!
- On the roof? - Yes!

656
01:01:25,665 --> 01:01:27,888
The fool in love!

657
01:01:28,629 --> 01:01:32,153
Go away, or I'll do to you
what I didn't do at the café!

658
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:35,342
Oh, speaking about the café, come here.

659
01:01:35,546 --> 01:01:40,053
How did you dare doing me
a raspberry in front of everyone?

660
01:01:40,314 --> 01:01:43,695
And you, how did you
dare calling me dishwasher?

661
01:01:43,834 --> 01:01:47,320
Hands off!
Because you are a dishwasher!

662
01:01:47,902 --> 01:01:50,642
Dishwasher will be you!
- Me, a dishwasher?

663
01:01:50,803 --> 01:01:53,520
Hold on!
- Ah!

664
01:01:53,783 --> 01:01:56,947
Giacomino! - Don't leave me!
Don't leave me!

665
01:01:57,099 --> 01:02:00,114
Hold on fast!
- What's beneath?

666
01:02:00,366 --> 01:02:03,586
The street, Giacomino!
- We are on the fifth floor!

667
01:02:04,718 --> 01:02:07,857
Giacomino! He's dead!

668
01:02:09,328 --> 01:02:10,330
The dogs!

669
01:02:14,428 --> 01:02:15,514
The dogs!

670
01:02:33,957 --> 01:02:36,527
All your fault!
- Shut up, fool!

671
01:02:37,735 --> 01:02:39,770
Hush! We must go away.

672
01:02:40,818 --> 01:02:44,160
If someone comes,
he'll believe that we are thieves.

673
01:02:44,551 --> 01:02:47,434
I'm afraid!
- Afraid... what of?

674
01:02:48,386 --> 01:02:50,095
Why should you be afraid?

675
01:02:50,184 --> 01:02:52,800
They have subsided...they're calm.

676
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:56,931
Yes, they're calm. - Come on, get out.
After all, they're just dogs.

677
01:02:57,259 --> 01:03:02,072
We'll pass next to them slowly. You'll
see, they'll wag the tail like this.

678
01:03:02,176 --> 01:03:05,910
And why? - Because
they understand that we are not afraid.

679
01:03:11,878 --> 01:03:15,120
See?
Come, come forward.

680
01:03:24,556 --> 01:03:26,073
Let's escape by here!

681
01:03:27,467 --> 01:03:28,820
People coming!

682
01:03:29,163 --> 01:03:32,312
You're so annoying!

683
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:35,876
Come in.
- Oh God, dogs too!

684
01:03:35,936 --> 01:03:40,329
Be good, dear, now I'm busy.
Go, dear, I'm busy.

685
01:03:40,537 --> 01:03:44,720
Come on, you wanted me to climb up here,
let's hear what you must tell me. Hurry!

686
01:03:44,877 --> 01:03:48,584
No ! Do not start with the same song!
- Pierotta... - I know!

687
01:03:48,644 --> 01:03:52,855
You want to tell me you love me and that
you cannot live without me! I know that!

688
01:03:52,915 --> 01:03:56,392
Pierotta, look at me,
this is not what I wanted to say.

689
01:03:56,546 --> 01:03:58,988
I know that you love someone else.

690
01:03:59,048 --> 01:04:02,480
What a nice discovery!
I told you myself! - It's true.

691
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:04,763
But it is terrible! Terrible!
- My God!

692
01:04:04,837 --> 01:04:10,074
I wanted to say that in this house,
full of your memories,..

693
01:04:10,194 --> 01:04:11,983
I will take away the life!

694
01:04:12,043 --> 01:04:13,538
You kill yourself?
- Yes!

695
01:04:13,598 --> 01:04:18,915
Why not tell me on the ground floor?
I would have saved stairs and time!

696
01:04:18,975 --> 01:04:24,297
No ! - Go to hell!
- Pierotta, I really do it!

697
01:04:25,611 --> 01:04:28,304
Let's run away!
- No, the dogs!

698
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:29,473
Right!

699
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:34,656
Let's face the situation!
- If there is another way out!

700
01:04:37,721 --> 01:04:39,575
Run away, he's coming back!

701
01:04:41,394 --> 01:04:45,726
All right, darling, all right!
I'll show you!

702
01:04:48,899 --> 01:04:49,951
What's he doing?

703
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:51,872
Come on.
- Come on.

704
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:55,449
He locked the door!
- Break it, break the door!

705
01:04:56,685 --> 01:04:58,716
No! He's coming back!

706
01:04:59,637 --> 01:05:05,528
You'll see, you'll see!
Laughs best who laughs last!

707
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:14,060
The fire is there..the door is closed...

708
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:18,398
Let's arrange to plug all the cracks!

709
01:05:22,944 --> 01:05:25,470
Now the window!

710
01:05:25,663 --> 01:05:28,254
She will see whom she's dealing with!

711
01:05:28,314 --> 01:05:31,515
She will see! She will see!

712
01:05:36,354 --> 01:05:39,469
He's plugging all the slits.
Why?

713
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:42,135
Who knows!

714
01:05:42,289 --> 01:05:44,910
That's it!
- He's coming back!

715
01:05:45,088 --> 01:05:49,030
So, you're deceiving me with another...
and I commit suicide!

716
01:05:49,467 --> 01:05:54,190
Sorry, I might be too energetic ...
but it takes what it takes.

717
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:55,868
But what's he doing?

718
01:05:56,344 --> 01:05:58,702
Don't you understand, stupid?

719
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,933
Wants to commit suicide.
- Ooh! And why?

720
01:06:02,130 --> 01:06:03,632
The portrait.

721
01:06:05,968 --> 01:06:09,313
You betray me...and I take revenge!

722
01:06:12,812 --> 01:06:13,894
The flowers!

723
01:06:14,111 --> 01:06:17,179
I was about
to commit suicide without flowers!

724
01:06:17,239 --> 01:06:19,355
 Where is my mind today!

725
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:28,432
Flowers!
- Here we die with due observance!

726
01:06:34,250 --> 01:06:37,091
I don't want to die!
- I'm going away.

727
01:06:38,130 --> 01:06:39,436
Well, well ...

728
01:06:39,981 --> 01:06:42,119
We begin to suffocate.

729
01:06:43,748 --> 01:06:45,618
I feel dizzy.

730
01:06:46,463 --> 01:06:48,237
My stomach aches.

731
01:06:49,973 --> 01:06:53,973
This time, your Gelsomino goes away!

732
01:06:54,084 --> 01:06:56,378
Here we end like the mice!

733
01:07:04,518 --> 01:07:08,109
Oh Gelsomino, what comes to your mind?

734
01:07:08,430 --> 01:07:11,235
Drink, Giacomino. Drink.

735
01:07:11,410 --> 01:07:16,057
Drink, Gelsomino, drink.
Nice, Gelsomino, nice!

736
01:07:16,292 --> 01:07:18,316
Drink!
- Thank you.

737
01:07:20,198 --> 01:07:23,273
Who are you?
What do you want? What's up?

738
01:07:23,333 --> 01:07:27,426
What's up? It's that,
when a person wants to commit suicide,..

739
01:07:27,486 --> 01:07:31,940
he has to see if there is someone
under the bed! If not, how do we do?

740
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,401
But how did you happen in my room?

741
01:07:34,461 --> 01:07:37,745
I would be dead by now!
Let me die. - No!

742
01:07:37,805 --> 01:07:40,925
Let me die! - No!
- Let me die!

743
01:07:42,588 --> 01:07:43,740
Enough!

744
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:46,580
Hey!
- So, you want to die?

745
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:50,173
Would you give up life,
and all the good things in life?

746
01:07:50,752 --> 01:07:53,020
Gelsomino...the sky!

747
01:07:53,166 --> 01:07:55,036
Gelsomino...the sea!

748
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:59,522
The mountains.
- Gelsomino, foodstuffs!

749
01:08:00,243 --> 01:08:05,366
Would you give up on love?
- Ah, love! - Love!

750
01:08:05,486 --> 01:08:10,070
Gelsomino, we too, are unhappy in love.

751
01:08:10,495 --> 01:08:12,929
You too suffer for a woman?
- Yeah!

752
01:08:12,989 --> 01:08:15,502
Then, can I do anything to help you?

753
01:08:15,562 --> 01:08:18,891
Heavens no!
We've already bothered you so much!

754
01:08:18,951 --> 01:08:23,532
We've already prevented you from dying.
- But I can kill myself with leisure.

755
01:08:23,592 --> 01:08:28,236
There's no hurry. And then your case
interests me. If I can be of help...

756
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:30,574
Shall we tell him?
- Okay.

757
01:08:31,713 --> 01:08:33,667
Gelsomino, we were quarreling.

758
01:08:33,727 --> 01:08:38,286
While quarreling, we fell
on the terrace, where the dogs are.

759
01:08:38,346 --> 01:08:40,592
How ugly they are!
Why keep them?

760
01:08:40,652 --> 01:08:43,418
You hurt yourselves?
- No. - Fortunately, no.

761
01:08:43,478 --> 01:08:47,776
We fought over a woman,
because we both love her.

762
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:52,087
We don't have the courage to speak,
and we'd like to know who she picks.

763
01:08:52,147 --> 01:08:57,224
I'll see to it! I'll talk to her myself!
In love matters, there's no one like me!

764
01:08:57,368 --> 01:09:00,181
You? - Yes.
- Hooray Gelsomino!

765
01:09:00,546 --> 01:09:03,512
Are you sure you can succeed?
- Oh, sure!

766
01:09:03,665 --> 01:09:08,340
So, we finally found
someone who will help us.

767
01:09:09,326 --> 01:09:11,799
Sure! You're right!

768
01:09:11,919 --> 01:09:17,220
You're very right to leave with
this nice young man you told me about!

769
01:09:17,347 --> 01:09:21,014
What does he do?
- He's a violinist. - Fine!

770
01:09:21,074 --> 01:09:25,392
And then, he loves me so much!
- He loves you!

771
01:09:25,556 --> 01:09:31,999
And then, what good would they be,
those two poor, shabby wretches!

772
01:09:32,059 --> 01:09:35,540
No, not that!
- Enough with the sentimentality!

773
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:38,650
But, leaving them like that...
- Leave a letter.

774
01:09:38,710 --> 01:09:43,874
Two pretty little words...and go!
Goodbye, miss.

775
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:46,663
Ah! They told me...

776
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:50,834
"Tell her
that we want to put at her feet"...

777
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:55,591
But what feet and feet!

778
01:09:55,770 --> 01:09:57,131
<i>Here!</i>

779
01:09:57,657 --> 01:09:59,756
<i>Here, please.</i>

780
01:10:01,151 --> 01:10:03,156
<i>Thank you.</i>

781
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:08,940
Will he have spoken to her?
- He promised that he would do it at 3.

782
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,956
It's almost 7 now!

783
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:16,260
Thanks, man!
Goodbye. - Good evening.

784
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:17,785
So, we agree:

785
01:10:18,308 --> 01:10:22,057
whatever her decision, we won't argue.

786
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:24,631
Of course, word of a gentleman!

787
01:10:24,691 --> 01:10:29,311
The chosen will marry her, and
the other goes away! - Agreed? - Yes.

788
01:10:33,065 --> 01:10:35,239
Perfume?
- A must!

789
01:10:35,478 --> 01:10:37,396
Let me do it!
- OK.

790
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:58,636
A good scent, huh?

791
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:01,832
Whatever the decision, huh?

792
01:11:01,992 --> 01:11:06,193
The chosen will marry her,
and the other goes away!

793
01:11:07,275 --> 01:11:09,116
Of course!

794
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:14,068
How do I look?
- Good, good! Very good!

795
01:11:14,222 --> 01:11:16,179
And how do I look?

796
01:11:16,239 --> 01:11:19,113
Behind, how do I look?
Hey!

797
01:11:20,406 --> 01:11:22,500
Hey! How do I look?

798
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:25,552
Very good, very good.

799
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:28,235
Good.
- Thanks.

800
01:11:29,894 --> 01:11:31,956
Lilì!
- Lilì!

801
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:34,165
Where is she?
- Lilì !

802
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:36,516
Oh! The surprise!

803
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:40,780
Ties!
- Nice! And dinner!

804
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:43,469
And the choice!
- Great!

805
01:11:43,529 --> 01:11:47,266
Clearly, the chosen will dine with her.

806
01:11:48,106 --> 01:11:49,879
She's gone!

807
01:11:51,144 --> 01:11:54,431
And why?
- Why! I do not know why!

808
01:11:54,884 --> 01:11:57,866
You're annoying!
She's gone!

809
01:11:59,416 --> 01:12:00,630
Dinner!

810
01:12:01,151 --> 01:12:02,260
Dinner.

811
01:12:02,378 --> 01:12:05,819
Even the dinner!
Ironically!

812
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:09,036
This is an insult!

813
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:14,447
You're hungry, huh?
- I? - Confess, confess.

814
01:12:14,507 --> 01:12:16,395
Be careful what you say!

815
01:12:16,540 --> 01:12:19,324
How can you be hungry?
- Good guy.

816
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,389
Right! One cannot eat!

817
01:12:25,018 --> 01:12:29,962
I'm going out, I will wander all night.
- You go out? - Yes!

818
01:12:30,475 --> 01:12:32,635
I'm staying.
- And so do I!

819
01:12:35,277 --> 01:12:36,819
Dinner...

820
01:12:37,668 --> 01:12:39,209
Dinner!

821
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:44,042
Rice...chicken!

822
01:12:45,421 --> 01:12:47,204
Rice rolls...

823
01:12:52,285 --> 01:12:54,396
Rice rolls...

824
01:12:54,917 --> 01:12:56,642
Rice rolls...!

825
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:00,592
Lilì...Rice rolls...!
