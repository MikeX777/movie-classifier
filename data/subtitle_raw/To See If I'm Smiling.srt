1
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,710
Sometimes I feel a little crazy.
I have these memories of things

2
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,750
﻿that are unrelated to reality
and maybe never even happened

3
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,190
﻿but I know they did happen,
as I feel them so intensely.

4
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,990
﻿Here's the infirmary.

5
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,270
﻿Snow in Hebron.

6
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,830
﻿I chose to become a medic.
It sounded nice.

7
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,110
﻿The idea of learning
a profession

8
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,470
﻿that could serve me
later in life.

9
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,950
﻿And also saving lives.

10
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,190
﻿I was very idealistic
in that sense.

11
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,510
﻿Just before the end
of the course.

12
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,310
﻿one girl told us about
her service in the Territories.

13
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,070
﻿how she goes with her helmet,
vest and weapon to every incident.

14
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:29,270
﻿how she treats the wounded,
choppers, operations, real action,

15
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,910
﻿"That's where it's happening,
that's where you're needed.

16
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,230
﻿"that's where you have to go."
I liked that.

17
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:41,510
﻿I said: If that's the best part of
the job. then that's what I want.

18
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:48,590
﻿I remember going into
the commander's room

19
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,630
﻿who was handing out
assignments.

20
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,350
﻿I was the last one to go in
and I still didn't know

21
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,710
﻿which assignments were left.

22
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,990
﻿And he surprised me.
I got Hebron.

23
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,550
﻿And I jumped for joy.

24
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,470
﻿Really?
-Yes.

25
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,750
﻿7! 6! 5!

26
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,830
﻿4! 3! 2! 1!

27
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,190
﻿I cried so much when
I first got there.

28
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,390
﻿You don't know what you'll
encounter... Gunshots...

29
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,110
﻿I can sense the danger
and the danger is real.

30
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,070
﻿All you hear,
all the time

31
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,950
﻿is "boom" or gunshots.

32
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,630
﻿The first thing I remember
is my overlapping week.

33
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,670
﻿We met the medical team
that serves there.

34
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,470
﻿We said hello.
I introduced myself.

35
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,750
﻿Next thing I remember
is hearing over the radio

36
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:54,190
﻿in the ambulance beside us:
"Man down in Noga 9.

37
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,670
﻿"man down in Noga 9."

38
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,710
﻿Before I knew it.
I was told that

39
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,190
﻿there was a wounded soldier
who needed to be evacuated.

40
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,510
﻿The medic ran first
and I ran after him.

41
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,150
﻿When I reached the door,
they yelled at me to duck.

42
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,950
﻿I did what everyone else did.
which was crawling on the floor.

43
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,750
﻿Then I noticed that there
were bullets flying...

44
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,790
﻿in every direction.

45
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,350
﻿When we left the building,
heading towards the ambulance.

46
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,070
﻿we had to run and hope that
no bullets would hit us.

47
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,830
﻿We drove back to
the infirmary at HQ.

48
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,670
﻿The doctor came,
shook my hand and said:

49
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,030
﻿"Congratulations,
that was your first incident.

50
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,310
﻿"That's how you learn."

51
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,190
﻿Then he ordered pizza
for all of us.

52
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,230
﻿There are 5 minors
currently on the Bar artery.

53
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,070
﻿They're definitely
up to something.

54
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,790
﻿Vertex to Snow White.

55
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:32,110
﻿They're heading towards
the far end of the Bar artery.

56
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,110
﻿Roger. I'm going there on foot.
I'll get to them on foot.

57
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,830
﻿It's loads of power.

58
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,550
﻿There's an incident
that's about to happen

59
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,190
﻿and it'll happen
the way you make it happen.

60
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,510
﻿You hear soldiers
panting over the radio,

61
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,550
﻿because you're making them run.

62
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,390
﻿they're running
because you said so.

63
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,830
﻿The commander radios in
and asks you what to do.

64
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,510
﻿You tell him where to go. "No,
on second thought, turn around."

65
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,390
﻿It's loads of power. Loads.

66
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:18,590
﻿And... you try to do
what's right with it.

67
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,510
﻿Vertex to Snow White.

68
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,830
﻿Vertex, they're on your right,
running away towards the schools.

69
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,910
﻿Roger. I'm on my way.

70
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:40,710
﻿Vertex. they're heading, towards
Intersection 76.

71
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,790
﻿Vertex to Snow White.

72
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,990
﻿Vertex, did you identify them?

73
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,350
﻿There were some stone throwers
and I got them.

74
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,870
﻿So I had to go to HQ.
make a statement

75
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,870
﻿and identify them
from a lineup.

76
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,590
﻿And it's scary
and I stressed out.

77
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,030
﻿All the way there. I started
doubting myself. I thought:

78
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:23,910
﻿"Maybe they didn't throw stones.
I can't remember what happened..."

79
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,470
﻿When I got there.
I saw them tied up.

80
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:40,430
﻿blindfolded, real life size.
Real, living people.

81
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,790
﻿Then I went in to write
my witness' statement.

82
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,590
﻿with my lack of confidence.

83
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,590
﻿So I asked the investigator:

84
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:58,350
﻿"What if... Let's say...
it didn't happen?

85
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,070
﻿"If they don't confess,
will you release them?"

86
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,750
﻿He looked at me and said:

87
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,630
﻿"They will confess."

88
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,590
﻿So I said: "But what
if they didn't do it?"

89
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,670
﻿He said: "They'll confess."

90
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,710
﻿You think: "I have to be here,
I have to do this, but I can't.

91
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,870
﻿"How will they confess?
In what way?"

92
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,750
﻿But then you go back to base and
have to start your next shift.

93
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,550
﻿You have to.
What, you won't do it?

94
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,030
﻿That was the atmosphere:
taking the jeep.

95
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,270
﻿doors open in the back,
driving fast,

96
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,670
﻿skidding and spinning out.
I remember thinking:

97
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:11,070
﻿"We're in the Wild West.
We can do whatever we feel like."

98
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:15,590
﻿Part of doing what you
feel like was, for example.

99
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,270
﻿to stop our jeep
next to a group of people.

100
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,190
﻿call them over with our finger,
to approach...

101
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,990
﻿This power, that you
just motion with your finger

102
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,510
﻿and the person comes.
No hesitation.

103
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,630
﻿There was one time when
we released a boy in the Strip.

104
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,430
﻿In the evening.
That night.

105
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,230
﻿the commander was patrolling
in the area in a jeep

106
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:48,310
﻿and he saw the boy sitting in
a corner, at a soldiers' post

107
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,630
﻿and he asked the soldiers:

108
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,630
﻿"What's he doing here?
We let him go hours ago."

109
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:59,070
﻿So they said: "We were
just playing with him."

110
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:06,270
﻿He approached the boy who
was crying and hysterical

111
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,110
﻿and...

112
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,030
﻿He was in a very bad state.
All beaten up.

113
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,790
﻿The commander returned
to the War Room and said:

114
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,190
﻿"Call the commander who's
in charge of those soldiers.

115
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:27,230
﻿"I want a report
about this event."

116
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,070
﻿The report arrived
at the War Room

117
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,510
﻿and it detailed how the soldiers,
who didn't lie about it.

118
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,910
﻿specifically stated

119
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:43,190
﻿how they beat him up.
put out cigarettes on him. etc.

120
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,590
﻿I handed the report
to my commander

121
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,190
﻿and he said:

122
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:55,790
﻿"Call that commander,
tell him that with this report

123
00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:00,870
﻿"we'll have the
Investigation Unit all over us.

124
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,710
﻿"Tell him to change the report."

125
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,630
﻿I remember that 30-second walk

126
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,350
﻿from his office back
to the War Room.

127
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:17,870
﻿with the report in my hand.

128
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,790
﻿I think it was the only time
in my service

129
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,190
﻿that I thought about
contacting a journalist.

130
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,190
﻿This is my chance.
I’m about to get another report.

131
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,950
﻿I could show him both versions,
as proof.

132
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,630
﻿I deliberated whether
I should photocopy it

133
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,350
﻿before it gets "buried" away,
but I didn't do it.

134
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,750
﻿I called the said commander,
and told him:

135
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:58,070
﻿"You are required to...
write up a new report."

136
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,910
﻿He said: "No problem."
And we got a new report.

137
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:11,150
﻿I was thinking about it
all day long, the new report said:

138
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,910
﻿"The boy is a pathological liar,
he also claimed...

139
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:20,790
﻿"that the soldiers did
this and that to him...

140
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,310
﻿"The boy is a pathological liar,
the soldiers

141
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:29,470
﻿"treated him well, etc."
And that was the end of it.

142
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:40,550
﻿I was struggling to remain humane,
at least a little.

143
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,230
﻿In the reality that I was in.
it was completely wiped out.

144
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,590
﻿Why didn't I do it?

145
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,950
﻿Because...

146
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:05,590
﻿it was just a fantasy.
There was no chance that...

147
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:12,470
﻿I really don't know
why I didn't do it.

148
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:43,230
﻿Lions, lions...

149
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,270
﻿The volume is very high
in the Territories.

150
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:54,590
﻿Everyone yells.
With one another and...

151
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,950
﻿Like. "Hey. dude."
everybody talks like this.

152
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,310
﻿and it's funny that
you, as a girl.

153
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:07,310
﻿take on masculine traits.

154
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:11,350
﻿You find yourself
talking like a man.

155
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,750
﻿you hide
feminine characteristics.

156
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,070
﻿For instance,
it was very cold in Hebron.

157
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,630
﻿so I'd wear a winter jumpsuit.

158
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,310
﻿which makes you look
like a teddy bear.

159
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,910
﻿not like a boy or a girl.

160
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,830
﻿you try to hide your
feminine characteristics.

161
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,830
﻿Because everyone
knows you're a woman.

162
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,750
﻿that won't change.

163
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,430
﻿but to be "one of the guys",
to belong.

164
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,150
﻿I'd only been
there for 4 days.

165
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,150
﻿the first time I met
my soldiers.

166
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,390
﻿I was really excited,
everyone asked me who I was.

167
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,670
﻿a new girl,
very interesting.

168
00:16:54,960 --> 00:17:00,870
﻿Then I noticed that they
were holding prayer beads

169
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,270
﻿and little Korans.
So I said: "Wow. that's nice."

170
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,550
﻿"Where did you get those?"

171
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,510
﻿So they said:
"We brought them from Qalqilya."

172
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:15,470
﻿I was like. "What?
But that's looting. It's forbidden."

173
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,910
﻿And they said:
"It's okay, it's okay."

174
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,790
﻿A few days later.
I met with the regiment commander

175
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,630
﻿and he asked me: "What's
your impression of us so far?"

176
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,030
﻿I said: "The regiment
is wonderful.

177
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,710
﻿"everyone's great, but I
noticed that a certain company

178
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,350
﻿"took some beads and
Korans from Qalqilya

179
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,990
﻿"and perhaps you should
look into that."

180
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:43,910
﻿He says: "What? Are you sure?"
I say: "Yes."

181
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,990
﻿So he phones the
company commander and says:

182
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,110
﻿"The Education NCO is here
and she says that she saw

183
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,950
﻿"this and that
in your company."

184
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,950
﻿The commander says:
"She's a liar!"

185
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,270
﻿I was so shocked.
Then he says:

186
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,710
﻿"If it did happen.
it will be strictly dealt with."

187
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,910
﻿Ok.

188
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,990
﻿A few days later. I went
to visit that company

189
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,790
﻿and its commander saw me.
He says:

190
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,950
﻿"So you're the Education NCO
who squealed on us?"

191
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,190
﻿And then
his soldiers started...

192
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,710
﻿I can't even describe it...
They banned me.

193
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,270
﻿They wouldn't let me into
their company for 4 months.

194
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,390
﻿If they saw me walk by.
they'd spit on the ground.

195
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,950
﻿I really regretted
having done that:

196
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,790
﻿From now on. if they're just
little things. I'll keep quiet.

197
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,110
﻿Your social status in the
regiment is very important.

198
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,350
﻿You're supposed to be the
sweet girl that everyone likes.

199
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,190
﻿who who keeps them company
and whose hair smells good.

200
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,230
﻿It's a very cushy job.

201
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,310
﻿All you have to do is wash
your hair every so often.

202
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,030
﻿I loved the guys,
they were great.

203
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,870
﻿I was a real queen there.

204
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,630
﻿I was a blonde,
and in our unit...

205
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,750
﻿Blondes get respect!

206
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,630
﻿There was a sick
sense of humor.

207
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:00,630
﻿We were nearby a mosque.

208
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,070
﻿when suddenly we hear
from the mosque:

209
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,710
﻿"I've Got the Power!"

210
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:08,790
﻿It's that song...
I don't remember how...

211
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,790
A very funny old song.

212
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,070
﻿Instead of "Allah is Great",
you hear: "I've Got the Power!"

213
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,110
﻿They just went up
to the mosque.

214
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,830
﻿changed the tapes,
and that was that.

215
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:23,110
﻿It was great,
it was a joke that...

216
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:26,070
﻿Whoever did it.
and I know who did.

217
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,470
﻿they were awesome!
What a brilliant thing to do!

218
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,510
﻿We really enjoyed
this adrenaline, the action.

219
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,590
﻿If there was an incident
on your shift, you felt lucky.

220
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,430
﻿It felt like...

221
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:00,750
﻿you were watching a soccer game
that you can't see.

222
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,710
﻿You wait for the
next big thing to happen.

223
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:07,270
﻿We'd turn the volume of
all the radios to the maximum

224
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,150
﻿and...

225
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,310
﻿"Well? Well?"

226
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,390
﻿Then there's a huge boom that
shakes the whole War Room.

227
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,150
﻿mission accomplished,
the house is destroyed.

228
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,270
﻿To get the best view point

229
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,870
﻿we'd run to the canteen
and climb up on the...

230
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,390
﻿picnic-style tables
that they had there.

231
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,270
﻿to see beyond the wall
really clearly.

232
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,430
﻿how Beit Hanun
was being attacked.

233
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,950
﻿In one of the operations,
two terrorists dressed up as women.

234
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,990
﻿Male soldiers
couldn't touch women.

235
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,710
﻿They weren't checked
and discovered

236
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,670
﻿and then they killed one soldier
and severely wounded another.

237
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,510
﻿We were only 4 female officers.

238
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:20,750
﻿they told us that from now on.

239
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,790
﻿each and every operation,
big or small.

240
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,590
﻿will include a female officer.

241
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,470
﻿So that anyone
who looks like a woman

242
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:34,110
﻿dressed in an
Arab woman's clothing.

243
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,870
﻿a female officer will check her.

244
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,350
﻿It was fun at first, getting
a lot of shooting training,

245
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:44,070
﻿shooting cans of Coke
in sand dunes.

246
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,550
﻿I'd put the cans in my office
and if someone annoyed me

247
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,190
﻿I'll tell him
he'd end up like the can.

248
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,870
﻿My first operation was
on my 20th birthday.

249
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,590
﻿A call came through
on the radio:

250
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:06,750
﻿"Palestinians are running amok
onto the streets."

251
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:11,150
﻿obviously, because their
houses were being bombed.

252
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:15,070
﻿It was the first time
I encountered a population

253
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:20,150
﻿in a real distressed state
of fighting, of war.

254
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,030
﻿Your house is being destroyed,
so you freak out

255
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,190
﻿and go out with
everything you've got.

256
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,630
﻿which is basically nothing,
and amok.

257
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,350
﻿I'm in the jeep
and all I can hear

258
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,790
﻿is the horrible sound of
the stones hitting the jeep.

259
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,510
﻿All you can see are stones.
People are mobbing you...

260
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,390
﻿We were wearing helmets
and the jeep was armored.

261
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,510
﻿then I was given a club.
one of the commanders said:

262
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,110
﻿"Go out there
and start hitting.

263
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:57,030
﻿"You're one of us. take
a club and get on with it!"

264
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,670
﻿That's what I remember,
a plot of land, rioting.

265
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,150
﻿a baby screaming.
I wanted to go pick him up.

266
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:17,790
﻿it was so instinctive,
to hug him. to calm him down.

267
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:24,950
﻿Then his mother came out
and looked at me

268
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:30,470
﻿with such hatred in her eyes,
and at that moment

269
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:34,470
﻿I realized exactly
who I was and how she saw me.

270
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,670
﻿I realized that
﻿I was in deep trouble.

271
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,550
﻿There was no way back.

272
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,390
﻿I thought that I had
a solid outlook on life

273
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,270
﻿but here, everything falls apart.

274
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,750
﻿You get used to it.

275
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,310
﻿You can't feel so much
all the time.

276
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,030
﻿It's not the time
for soul-searching.

277
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,510
﻿From the start. I never told anyone
what was happening there.

278
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,990
﻿It seemed impossible.

279
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,630
﻿Things seemed different there.

280
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,750
﻿There were different rules,
different conduct.

281
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,390
﻿different atmosphere.

282
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,790
﻿Besides, everybody knew about
the major incidents, right?

283
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,270
﻿That a baby girl was killed
by a Palestinian sniper.

284
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:48,270
﻿everyone knows the facts
that are reported in the media.

285
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,990
﻿there's nothing new to add.

286
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:54,350
﻿For me, it took on
a different dimension.

287
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,910
﻿There was a baby girl
who was wounded

288
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,710
﻿and we couldn't treat her
very well.

289
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,150
﻿And I felt that
she was on my hands

290
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,230
﻿because I'm
the sector commander.

291
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,390
﻿I'm overseeing
the incident

292
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:24,670
﻿and I'm in charge
of the wounded.

293
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,630
It ﻿was the first incident
in which...

294
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:39,310
﻿I had a fatal casualty.

295
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,990
﻿And it wasn't just a fatal
casualty, it was a baby girl

296
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:49,870
﻿whose picture I saw in
the paper the next day.

297
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,470
﻿But it passed.
And everyone said:

298
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,070
﻿"Congratulations, that was
your first fatal casualty."

299
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:08,550
﻿And a few minutes later,
we had to deal with new thing

300
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:30,310
﻿You reach a point where
they're all the same to you.

301
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,110
﻿There are no exceptions.

302
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,830
﻿At the time,
they were all the same to me.

303
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,350
﻿It doesn't matter if someone
smiles at me or is nice to me.

304
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,310
﻿﻿I don't see that.

305
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:46,950
﻿"Why are you coming in here?
You don't have an Israeli ID.

306
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,590
﻿"what do you want?"

307
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,830
﻿You're so bitter,
it's not bitterness of one day.

308
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,590
﻿It's not depression,
it's something that...

309
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,750
It's ﻿trying to impose order.

310
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,910
﻿When I heard that
Hanny Abramov had been shot.

311
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,750
﻿I felt like a bullet
had just hit my heart.

312
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,270
﻿I didn't know what
happened to her.

313
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:23,630
﻿I just heard about it
and I was in a total shock.

314
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,910
﻿I went out for my next shift,
and of course.

315
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:36,030
﻿Hanny was in my thoughts.

316
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,390
﻿Every Arab I saw.
saw Hanny in my mind.

317
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:43,110
﻿I felt that every Arab
I stopped that day.

318
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,670
﻿I was assigned at
a checkpoint that day.

319
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,190
﻿﻿I felt as if HE
had done that to her.

320
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:55,630
﻿During that 12-hour shift.
I detained about 80 people.

321
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,870
﻿Arabs.
I stood them in a line

322
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,870
﻿and decided they will stay
the 12-14 hours of my shift.

323
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,670
﻿in the hot sun.

324
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,990
﻿I, like,
decided to punish them.

325
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:21,150
﻿I made them stand there and
do push-ups and all sorts of...

326
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:25,470
﻿I made them stand in threes, as if
they were my soldiers, recruits.

327
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,790
﻿I also started
screaming at them and...

328
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,990
﻿for no reason.
I started yelling:

329
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:40,790
﻿"Why did you do that to Hanny?
She didn't deserve that!

330
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,590
﻿"Do you know who Hanny is?
She's my friend!"

331
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,470
﻿Of course, they had no idea
what I was talking about, but...

332
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,390
﻿There wasn't
anyone else around.

333
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,790
﻿just my soldiers and
they accepted it.

334
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,910
﻿I mean, what I did wasn't
out of the ordinary.

335
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,550
﻿My job was to inspect
the female population.

336
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,230
﻿Any layers on.
coats and such

337
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:38,670
﻿they had to take it all off,
down to their bra and panties.

338
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,350
﻿so I could see.

339
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:45,150
﻿"Lift up your clothes.
I need to feel them."

340
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,230
﻿You push them against the wall
and spread their legs from behind.

341
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,150
﻿Check them really well.

342
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,470
﻿At times they had me check
more intimate places.

343
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,350
﻿No, no penetration,
just with my hand.

344
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:14,190
﻿Suddenly I heard a scream:
The border guard kicked

345
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,270
﻿the hand of the woman
I was about to check.

346
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,870
﻿very hard.
A knife flew up in the air.

347
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,270
﻿He picked it up and said:
"Look, she wanted to kill you

348
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,430
﻿"Go deal with her!"

349
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,070
﻿The soldiers are, like.
"Come on. beat her up.

350
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:33,070
﻿"teach her a lesson,
she wanted to kill you.

351
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,750
﻿"she had a knife in her hand."
Etc. etc.

352
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,150
﻿I couldn't stand her screaming.
Between them and her screaming.

353
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:42,230
﻿it was too much.
So I just yelled:

354
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,590
﻿"Stop screaming!"

355
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,990
﻿I could've taken out on her
all my bitterness

356
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:50,750
﻿for having to be there.
﻿I could have!

357
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,670
﻿But I only took out
a fifth of my bitterness.

358
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:58,710
﻿After all, she wanted
to kill me. Slaughter me.

359
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,230
﻿It's not that I caught
an innocent bystander.

360
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:05,590
﻿She wanted to kill me.
I could've done...

361
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,750
﻿"He who rises to kill you.
kill him first."

362
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,830
﻿I didn't do it.
but I felt that rage.

363
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:21,710
﻿It totally freaked me out.
and from that moment on.

364
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,470
﻿I think it really messed me up.

365
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,870
﻿55. what's your location?

366
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,150
﻿Vertex to Snow White.
-Roger.

367
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,750
﻿It was an ordinary
observing shift.

368
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,110
﻿when suddenly I saw
some people standing.

369
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,390
﻿It was clearly going to be
a fire-bomb incident.

370
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:56,590
﻿Then my heart starts pounding.
I start to feel the adrenaline.

371
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:59,550
﻿I started making calls,
alerting the forces.

372
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,390
﻿I talked to about 30 people...

373
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,070
﻿And then..

374
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,150
﻿You wait.

375
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:20,430
﻿During that time,
you're split in two.

376
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,510
﻿On one hand, you're
saying: "Come on. do something

377
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,430
﻿"Throw something, do something
You're waiting for it.

378
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,790
﻿You've already alerted
all the forces in the world.

379
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,310
﻿so if nothing happens...

380
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,390
﻿everyone will laugh at you
or will be angry

381
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,550
﻿or in future incidents
they may think twice

382
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:43,670
﻿before responding to your call.
You have a status to maintain.

383
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,990
﻿Then they light
a fire bomb.

384
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:54,110
﻿And our snipers
opened fire.

385
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:59,350
﻿Then suddenly this guy
radios in frantically and says:

386
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,150
﻿"I've got an Oleander here."

387
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,150
﻿Oleander means
a fatal casualty.

388
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,550
﻿That's it.
Then I stopped feeling.

389
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,190
﻿My friend came in, I told her
to sit down, and I left.

390
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,870
﻿You can't do that,
it's an incident.

391
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,510
﻿forces are involved.
I'm needed.

392
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,390
﻿I didn't even explain
to her what had happened.

393
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,110
﻿I just left.

394
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,230
﻿An hour later
they reported on the news

395
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,950
﻿that there was a fatal casualty.
I killed a man.

396
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,590
﻿All you can think about
is that you killed a man.

397
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,670
﻿Then they said
it was a boy.

398
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:07,510
﻿The unbearable lightness
of death, that's what it was.

399
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,990
﻿The death of people
I knew who were killed

400
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:13,590
﻿and the death of the
Palestinians who were killed.

401
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:19,110
﻿I remember this guy who
jumped up on the fence

402
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,390
﻿and started yelling hysterically:
"Allah is Great. Allah is Great!"

403
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:28,910
﻿In the early days, we'd shoot
to warn. Now, we shot to kill.

404
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:33,270
﻿I remember the day they killed
that guy on the fence.

405
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,750
﻿His body remained
hanging on the fence.

406
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,030
﻿And I...
I remember I was...

407
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,470
﻿It was so...
I didn't know what to do.

408
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,910
﻿I was in the office
with my medics.

409
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:57,990
﻿And my commanding officer
came and said: "There's a body.

410
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,110
﻿"Who wants to come see it?"

411
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:06,830
﻿There was a group of wanted men
and one of them was shot dead.

412
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,710
﻿I jumped up and said:
"I want to see!"

413
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,750
﻿I remember riding
in the ambulance.

414
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:23,870
﻿I was sitting opposite Uriel
and he kept wanting to puke.

415
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:27,230
﻿also wanted to.
but I couldn't tell him that.

416
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:31,070
﻿otherwise we both would've puked.
The body stank so badly.

417
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:37,030
﻿so we put a blanket over it
and wrapped ourselves too.

418
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,070
﻿so as not to smell it.

419
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,230
﻿From time to time,
our eyes fell on the body.

420
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,750
﻿which was covered,
but it didn't help.

421
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,190
﻿He kept saying
that he wanted to puke

422
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,150
﻿and I kept telling him
to hang in there.

423
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:02,990
﻿We took the body
to the infirmary

424
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:07,110
﻿where we were told that..

425
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:12,270
﻿before the body is returned
to the Palestinian Authority.

426
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:18,270
﻿we have to clean it so there
won't be any blood stains on it.

427
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:21,950
﻿so they won't see what we did
to him. The state he was in.

428
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,390
﻿And that job was
assigned to me.

429
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,870
﻿Because he'd suffered
a non-fatal head injury

430
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:43,270
﻿and slowly bled to death.

431
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:48,550
﻿he lost control over his
sphincters. That's what happens.

432
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,830
﻿So...

433
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,630
﻿He urinated and
shat on himself.

434
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,390
﻿So we used a water hose
to clean him

435
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,230
﻿and he's lying there
with his eyes open.

436
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:10,070
﻿so I close his eyes because
Uriel tells me he's scared.

437
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:16,030
﻿I close his eyes and
continue hosing him down

438
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,510
﻿and scraping off the blood
from various parts.

439
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:26,230
﻿And then his eyes opened again.
It happens, it's a reflex.

440
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:33,510
﻿And it's a very scary moment.
It's as if he's coming back to life.

441
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:03,310
﻿People look at me. like:
"You did what?!

442
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,750
﻿"You cleaned a corpse?!"

443
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,950
﻿And they're repelled by it.

444
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,470
﻿But I can't let myself
be repelled by it.

445
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,710
﻿Why?

446
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:26,710
﻿Why?
Because it's on my hands.

447
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,910
﻿I have to keep using my hands,
I can't be repelled by it.

448
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,150
﻿I'm washing dishes
in the kitchen.

449
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:59,670
﻿which is what I did
most of the time.

450
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:04,710
﻿suddenly there's this commotion
and I hear the guys coming in

451
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:09,870
﻿and I understand that they've
returned with something.

452
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,390
﻿they're not empty-handed.

453
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:18,550
﻿I dry my soapy hands and
go outside to see what's up.

454
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,750
﻿I see they're back
with dead bodies.

455
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:26,670
﻿of terrorists, on stretchers,
that were covered.

456
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:31,110
﻿They say: "Yep. we've got
some terrorists' bodies here."

457
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,030
﻿I'm like: "What"?
Cool What...?”

458
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:38,110
﻿It really deterred me, this
unexpected presence of death.

459
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:42,670
﻿Then they pulled out cameras and
took pictures with the bodies.

460
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,790
﻿I thought: "It's wrong to take
pictures with dead bodies."

461
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,670
﻿On the other hand,
it wasn't terrible enough

462
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,950
﻿to make me call
a journalist and say:

463
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,590
﻿"Oh dear, they're taking
pictures with dead bodies.

464
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,790
﻿"we need to alert the world..."

465
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,470
﻿I didn't think for a moment
that taking pictures

466
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,630
﻿with dead bodies was normal.
It's not normal.

467
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:05,510
﻿But the reality of the Territories
isn't normal either.

468
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,390
﻿Everything that
happens there isn't normal.

469
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,110
﻿but somehow... it works.

470
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,310
﻿A minus and a minus
make a plus.

471
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:18,950
﻿Abnormal and abnormal work.
It fits.

472
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,710
﻿I'm in the shower
and my mother shouts:

473
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,190
﻿"They say your Brigade Commander
is wounded."

474
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,470
﻿I get out of the ﻿shower.

475
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:50,750
﻿look at my military cell phone
and see 20 unanswered calls.

476
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,230
﻿all from my commander,
so I call him.

477
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,550
﻿I barely said a word
and he starts screaming:

478
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,350
﻿"Come to Hadassah Hospital
in Jerusalem now!

479
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,070
﻿"I don't care how!"

480
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:06,150
﻿Total panic, hysteria...
And he hung up.

481
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:10,150
﻿I understood that I had
to get there immediately.

482
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,910
﻿I didn't know how or why.

483
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:15,590
﻿or what do I, an Education
Officer, have got to do with it.

484
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,070
﻿I got my dad and
we drove to Jerusalem.

485
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:23,750
﻿I saw all the wounded cut open,
ready to be operated on.

486
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,430
﻿I ﻿saw the blood, the injuries.

487
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:33,630
﻿passing by me.
some people I knew too.

488
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,310
﻿They were delegating roles:
"You do that, you go there...

489
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,630
﻿"Dana, you'll report

490
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,030
﻿"when the critically wounded
become fatal casualties!"

491
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,910
﻿You're in the middle of it.

492
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:47,870
﻿you get to the scene of the attack
a minute after the event.

493
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,870
﻿With all the ambulances, the
police cars, you're there.

494
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:56,830
﻿Evacuating the wounded,
anything that needs to be done.

495
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:02,150
﻿And you see an arm.
just lying there on the road...

496
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,310
﻿Then, an insane wave
of incidents began.

497
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:34,070
﻿Every week or two.
there was an incident

498
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:39,030
﻿with fatal casualties.
From this brigade, that unit...

499
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:41,870
﻿All the time,
more and more dead.

500
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:49,030
﻿I made up a "bereavement kit", so
I could function quickly. 1.2.3.

501
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,230
﻿What was in the kit?

502
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,590
﻿A list of newspaper cuttings
I had to collect.

503
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:00,710
﻿an operations tactical board,
ready to use.

504
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:08,070
﻿memorial candles, barbwire,
to make it more heartbreaking.

505
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,070
﻿You carry on.
There's dinner

506
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:26,190
﻿and tomorrow's tasks
and equipment to arrange

507
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,870
﻿and things to finalize and...
you don't stop.

508
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:39,230
﻿In this particular area,
we'd patrol

509
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:43,110
﻿very late at night.
I was in an armored jeep.

510
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,230
﻿when suddenly I spot someone.
An Arab.

511
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:53,870
﻿He's looking at me.
He sees I am alone in the jeep.

512
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:59,990
﻿He's trying to catch my gaze
and I stare right at him.

513
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,030
﻿And he starts making
rude gestures at me.

514
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:12,510
﻿I looked him straight in the eye.
and all I was concerned about

515
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,870
﻿was memorizing
his looks and clothes.

516
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:19,350
﻿I remember it to this day:
He wore red shorts.

517
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,110
﻿a white T-shirt, and had
medium-length black hair.

518
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,950
﻿I memorized
his exact description

519
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:29,070
﻿and as soon as he saw my guys
returning, he fled.

520
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:30,910
﻿Ran like crazy.

521
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:36,030
﻿I told my soldiers to
dump their paper cups.

522
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:37,630
﻿because I wanted to go fast.

523
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,710
﻿﻿I was ready at the whee

524
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:46,790
﻿I drove so fast.
When we found him and caught him.

525
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:51,230
﻿he realized who I was
and what was going on.

526
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,950
﻿We took him into
one of the alleys and..

527
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:58,670
﻿I started screaming at him.

528
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:04,830
﻿I made him look me in the eyes
and confess.

529
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:11,350
﻿He didn't respond,
he just lowered his gaze.

530
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:16,590
﻿We undressed him
down to his underwear.

531
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:19,950
﻿And we abused him.

532
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:50,310
﻿The weekend comes along and
again I'm alone in the sector.

533
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:55,030
﻿again we’re on high alert
and there's a shooting battle.

534
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:57,070
﻿and again.
there's another dead body.

535
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:03,590
﻿And what is by now normal
procedure, we take the body.

536
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:09,350
﻿put it near the latrines,
and wash it.

537
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:13,430
Then..

538
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:18,070
﻿something very funny happens:
he has an erection.

539
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,510
﻿A dead body with an erection.

540
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:25,190
﻿We laugh a little,
because it's embarrassing.

541
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,550
﻿And...

542
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:32,190
﻿It's open grounds,
so anyone can come take a peek.

543
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:39,790
﻿Some female sergeants that I knew
arrive from the operations room.

544
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:43,990
﻿One of them has a camera and...

545
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:47,430
﻿without even thinking. I tell her:
"Come take my picture."

546
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:54,350
﻿I sit down next to
the dead body and...

547
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:56,470
﻿I have my picture taken.

548
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:21,950
﻿"Dear Meytal what can we say
that you don't already know?

549
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,790
﻿"You know that we love you.

550
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:26,510
﻿"you know that
we will miss you very much.

551
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:31,070
﻿"So we just want to wish you
good luck in civilian life."

552
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,270
Turn it around!

553
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:03,750
﻿Cheers. Meytal

554
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:12,150
﻿I'm not sure when it was.
but at some point

555
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:15,790
﻿I became very ashamed
of that picture.

556
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:19,190
﻿And...

557
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,510
﻿I didn't tell anyone about it.

558
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:25,150
﻿that it existed.
I forgot about it a little.

559
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,990
﻿But I would like to see it.

560
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:34,590
﻿To see if I look different.

561
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:38,190
﻿I want to see
if I'm smiling.

562
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:02,870
﻿Who wants to deal
with the evil inside him.

563
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:05,110
﻿with his alienation
towards others?

564
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:06,950
﻿Who wants to deal
with that?

565
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:22,590
﻿Dealing with
these questions is painful.

566
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:37,710
﻿After being released
from the army.

567
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:40,150
﻿I couldn't sleep at night.

568
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:44,310
﻿I couldn't share what I was
going through with anyone.

569
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:47,350
﻿﻿I didn't want to either.

570
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:52,590
﻿I'd go out to a bar at night
and drink as much as I could.

571
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:58,830
﻿I'd get back home in the
early hours of the morning

572
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,750
﻿and fall into bed.

573
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,310
﻿I'd wake up
after a few hours

574
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:11,950
﻿and start looking
for my next drink.

575
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,590
﻿It went on like that
for a very long time.

576
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:26,350
﻿5. 4. 3...

577
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:31,030
﻿I, Sergeant Rotem Livne.
hereby light this beacon...

578
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:33,510
﻿"Dedicated
to the one and only"

579
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,430
﻿"Welcome to the end
of your service!"

580
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,870
﻿You will see. you will see

581
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:48,270
﻿How good it'll be

582
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:52,350
﻿Next year

583
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:07,150
﻿"Oh. how good it'll be
(God willing!) next year"

584
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:10,470
﻿In honor of the glorious
State of Israel.

585
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:24,830
﻿I don't like to talk
about it with just anyone.

586
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:28,470
﻿But I also don't..

587
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:30,750
﻿It's what I am,
it's a part of me.

588
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:35,870
﻿it's part of what
go through every day.

589
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:45,230
﻿I don't tell.
I don't go into details.

590
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:49,590
﻿I say: "I killed a boy."

591
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:56,230
﻿I don't even say "the army".

592
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:04,630
﻿Do you think about it?

593
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,870
﻿It's hard to think about it.

594
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,830
I ﻿used to think about it a lot.

595
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,590
﻿but now I just laugh about it.

596
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,950
﻿As much as one can.

597
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,710
﻿Now it's just a part of me.

598
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:44,590
﻿I used to go home on leave

599
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:48,990
﻿and call my friend in the army:

600
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:51,710
﻿"Sivan, it won't come off!"

601
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:53,390
﻿"What won't come off. Rotem?"

602
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,590
﻿"﻿I keep trying with soap!"

603
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:56,990
﻿"What won't come off. Rotem?"

604
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:58,630
﻿"The blood, off my hands!

605
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:02,870
﻿"I have blood on my hands.
I don't know what to do!"

606
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:11,310
﻿I don't know if she understood,
that I'm not joking.

607
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:13,350
﻿The blood won't come off
and I keep trying.

608
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:38,790
﻿Who's my sweetie pie?
Who's my sweetie pie?

609
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:42,390
﻿Who is so sweet?
Who is so gorgeous?

610
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,670
﻿Gorgeous!

611
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:50,590
﻿Turn over, that's it.
Good for you.

612
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:55,270
﻿Crawl, my darling, crawl.

613
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:58,870
﻿Whenever my baby starts
yelling hysterically.

614
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,990
﻿which isn't very often,
but when it happens.

615
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:05,550
﻿and when it plays on that nerve,
what does that tell me?

616
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:09,950
﻿It takes me back there.
So I'm there.

617
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:12,590
﻿What happened there?
I felt bad?

618
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:14,910
﻿I did something that's
against my principles?

619
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:17,710
﻿It's a kind of black past

620
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:21,110
﻿that I would be glad to
erase from my life? There!

621
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:24,430
﻿And then it's
not just guilt.

622
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:29,310
﻿it’s a mirror,
an unpleasant one.

623
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:32,430
﻿and it brings out violence in me.

624
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:37,070
﻿It brings out violence in me.
I become...

625
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:38,190
﻿And you know.

626
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:41,790
﻿I think that I'm
a pretty good mother.

627
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:45,790
﻿Except for those moments,
when I'm like the devil.

628
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:50,310
﻿Sivan?

629
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:59,550
﻿Sivan?

630
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:05,110
﻿Sivan?

631
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:07,190
﻿I'm here.
-You're here.

632
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:17,430
﻿Hello, madam.
-Hello.

633
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,310
﻿How's it going?
-Good, how are you?

634
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:35,910
﻿Snow in Hebron.

635
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:04,510
﻿Shall I put them in
an envelope for you

636
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:23,390
﻿How in the hell did I ever think
I'd be able to forget about it?
