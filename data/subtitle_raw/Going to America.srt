[playful music]

00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:29,333
-Tug it, tug it!
-Like that,
nice and slow.

4
00:00:29,507 --> 00:00:32,423
-Tug it, no tug it hard.
-Now slower harder,
you like that?

5
00:00:32,597 --> 00:00:33,598
Next!

6
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:36,949
-Next!
-[moans]

7
00:00:37,689 --> 00:00:38,734
Jesus!

8
00:00:56,012 --> 00:00:57,057
Oh.

9
00:00:59,015 --> 00:01:03,411
I had another accident
last night,
dreaming of my princess.

10
00:01:04,151 --> 00:01:09,765
-[sighs]
-OK good morning,
Prince Fumnanya.

11
00:01:11,027 --> 00:01:15,901
My name
is not "Fum-nan-ya."
It's Fum-Na-NY-a.

12
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:22,038
-Like Nanya business.
-Sorry, not up
on my African nomenclatures.

13
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:25,259
What is so good
about this morning?

14
00:01:27,913 --> 00:01:29,219
Any problems?

15
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:35,269
-Just you, Dr. Tucker.
-I am your doctor,

16
00:01:35,834 --> 00:01:39,316
-not your problem.
-You are just a tsotsi,

17
00:01:39,882 --> 00:01:41,884
paid by my father.

18
00:01:43,929 --> 00:01:49,413
Tell me,
are you still engaging
in those romantic delusions?

19
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:06,865
I will be a hero
and win the heart,
of a beautiful princess.

20
00:02:07,866 --> 00:02:11,479
Be a hero and win
the heart of his princess,
that is sweet isn't it?

21
00:02:12,219 --> 00:02:18,486
Maybe I can do a little
makeover, some elevator shoes.
Something, maybe?

22
00:02:19,226 --> 00:02:22,229
I will put the Igbo hex on you.

23
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:27,712
-Oh!
- Keep thinking like that,
and you will never

24
00:02:27,886 --> 00:02:29,279
get out of here.

25
00:02:34,066 --> 00:02:36,025
Good morning, Andy.

26
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:38,158
I hope you don't
follow the footsteps
of your friend there.

27
00:02:38,462 --> 00:02:41,073
You're actually
showing real progress.
There is actually

28
00:02:41,248 --> 00:02:44,860
-some hope for you.
-Oh right in the face.

29
00:02:45,513 --> 00:02:49,517
-Hey, down, down, down!
-Hey get your hands off that.

30
00:02:49,691 --> 00:02:53,129
Do not touch that.
Keep walking please.
Do not touch that!

31
00:02:53,303 --> 00:02:55,436
-Go!
-Fumnaki, Fumnami!

32
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,526
Bumba clot, ras clot.

33
00:03:00,005 --> 00:03:02,225
Andy seriously,
don't follow
in his footsteps OK?

34
00:03:02,399 --> 00:03:04,488
-Well he's following
his footsteps.
-No I mean follow his footsteps,

35
00:03:04,706 --> 00:03:06,838
-just keep going follow him.
-Now he's confused.

36
00:03:07,404 --> 00:03:08,710
-Now they're all confused.
-What's that smell?

37
00:03:08,884 --> 00:03:09,798
-That's that one!
-That is disgusting.

38
00:03:09,972 --> 00:03:11,060
I'm not cleaning that.

00:03:17,153 --> 00:03:18,198

Harder, harder!
Not that hard,
not that hard!

43
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,608
Yeah woo hoo!

44
00:03:38,392 --> 00:03:40,394
-Yeah take that!
-What?

45
00:03:45,399 --> 00:03:46,400
[exhausted]

46
00:03:48,924 --> 00:03:53,407
Are you done?
You are cleaning that up.

47
00:04:00,762 --> 00:04:01,763
[sighs]

48
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:18,083
I am so sick and tired
of these two delinquents.

49
00:04:19,302 --> 00:04:21,173
I am going to teach them
a lesson, Mr Bones.

50
00:04:21,348 --> 00:04:22,653
[knocks on table]

51
00:04:22,827 --> 00:04:24,220
I'm going to teach
them a lesson.

52
00:04:28,398 --> 00:04:29,399
[screams]

53
00:04:39,801 --> 00:04:41,150
I will have another one.

54
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:45,415
Here you are.

55
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:06,958
-I am not as stupid
as Dr. Tucker thinks.
-I'm sure you're not.

56
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:13,965
He cannot over medicate me
against my contempt
for his foolish head.

57
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:16,707
Yeah that,
I'm not so sure of.

58
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:21,233
Take it, take it.

59
00:05:23,192 --> 00:05:24,193
[pills spill on ground]

60
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,342
We must achieve our freedom.

61
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,565
-And how will we do that?
-We will escape.

62
00:05:54,397 --> 00:05:58,358
-Where will we go?
-On an adventure.

63
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:03,841
Oh, I'm too tired
for an adventure.

64
00:06:06,278 --> 00:06:08,193
I just want a decent meal.

65
00:06:12,023 --> 00:06:17,594
We will make a movie.
A movie about a princess,
and a hero.

66
00:06:19,204 --> 00:06:22,338
-Are you insane?
-That is the point of our movie.

67
00:06:22,512 --> 00:06:25,994
-That you're crazy?
-That I can get
a beautiful woman,

68
00:06:26,342 --> 00:06:31,216
-and receive my just rewards.
-Hey can I be in the movie,

69
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,480
eating pizza and drinking beer?

70
00:06:35,003 --> 00:06:37,266
I forget what real food
even tastes like.

71
00:06:38,093 --> 00:06:41,488
You can have all the pizza
and beer you want, Andy.

72
00:06:43,098 --> 00:06:47,624
But you must be the director,
I will be the hero.

73
00:06:50,018 --> 00:06:51,280
That's ridiculous.

74
00:06:52,324 --> 00:06:55,327
-How am I going to be
a director?
-Trust me, Andy.

75
00:06:56,372 --> 00:06:57,591
I have a plan.

76
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,551
Oh, god help us.

77
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:09,254
You have been trying
to put together that puzzle,
for two years.

78
00:07:11,866 --> 00:07:14,303
You and your invisible friend.

79
00:07:21,832 --> 00:07:24,226
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

80
00:07:24,531 --> 00:07:27,272
-I have good news.
-Oh, what is that?

81
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:31,538
-I am about to escape
from this wretched place.
-Really?

82
00:07:32,016 --> 00:07:35,193
Yes, and you are going
to help me.
-I am?

83
00:07:35,542 --> 00:07:38,936
-Why would I do that?
-Because if you do not,

84
00:07:39,502 --> 00:07:43,550
then everyone will know about
the lap dances
on Dr. Tucker.

85
00:07:47,118 --> 00:07:50,818
I do not think his wife,
or his boss would approve,
and both of you

86
00:07:50,992 --> 00:07:52,297
would be out of a job.

87
00:07:54,299 --> 00:07:56,998
-I would be out of a job
even more if I-
-I would not be

88
00:07:57,172 --> 00:07:58,434
so sure about that.

89
00:07:59,914 --> 00:08:04,092
you are new here,
and you probably do not know
about his wife,

90
00:08:04,266 --> 00:08:07,617
-and what she did
to the last nurse he was--
-The last nurse?

91
00:08:08,226 --> 00:08:12,448
She was found gagged,
and tagged
in a basement, tortured.

92
00:08:12,622 --> 00:08:14,406
It was on the TV news.

93
00:08:15,973 --> 00:08:20,064
-Oh my god,
I didn't know.
-Dr. Tucker is a very sick man.

94
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,939
He is a shaman possessed
by evil spirits.
If you ask me,

95
00:08:25,113 --> 00:08:27,289
he is the one who
should be sedated.

96
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:31,075
But he is a boy scout,
compared to his wife.

97
00:08:32,424 --> 00:08:37,168
So you could either help me,
or you could be gagged,
and tagged.

98
00:08:37,734 --> 00:08:39,823
OK, what do you need me to do?

99
00:08:42,043 --> 00:08:46,700
-Something very easy,
it would be our little secret.
-Secret.

100
00:08:47,918 --> 00:08:53,837
Small bit of advice.
But if I were you,
I would start carrying a gun.

101
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:07,111
[adventurous music]

102
00:09:29,525 --> 00:09:30,570
[laughing]

103
00:09:48,239 --> 00:09:52,722
-Retrieve the camera.
-Now?

104
00:09:56,030 --> 00:10:00,817
This is the opening scene
of our movie.
We have achieved our freedom.

105
00:10:01,731 --> 00:10:03,603
It is a very inspiring moment.

106
00:10:08,216 --> 00:10:10,218
-How do you work this thing?
-Let me see.

107
00:10:14,091 --> 00:10:17,834
It is easy,
auto focus,
auto zoom,

108
00:10:18,922 --> 00:10:24,188
let me give it a try.
This is the beginning
of our movie.

109
00:10:24,362 --> 00:10:25,407
[snoring]

110
00:10:30,194 --> 00:10:32,327
-OK.
-OK here let me see.

111
00:10:37,027 --> 00:10:41,989
-Hello, I am Fumnanya.
-Wait, I am the director right?

112
00:10:42,903 --> 00:10:44,861
-Because I didn't say action?
-Sorry.

113
00:10:45,035 --> 00:10:46,646
-So just wait for me to say it.
-OK.

114
00:10:50,171 --> 00:10:55,916
-Action.
-Hello, I am Fumnanya,
and this is our movie.

115
00:10:56,351 --> 00:11:01,486
It is a movie about a man, me.
Who is on a quest to find
a beautiful princess,

116
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:02,923
he can rescue.

117
00:11:03,706 --> 00:11:06,317
And his reward in the end,
is a kiss.

118
00:11:07,579 --> 00:11:09,016
-A kiss?
-Yes.

119
00:11:09,233 --> 00:11:11,366
-That is all you expect?
-That is all I want.

120
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:15,109
What kind of African are you?
You're supposed to be
a noble savage.

121
00:11:15,283 --> 00:11:21,115
I am a noble one.
But this is America,
we must be romantic.

122
00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:25,467
-No no, this is stupid.
-It is my quest.

123
00:11:26,468 --> 00:11:28,688
It is my movie,
it is my story, Andy.

124
00:11:31,212 --> 00:11:33,257
-Fine.
-Good.

125
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:38,785
All I have to do now,
is find my princess,
and save her.

126
00:11:39,481 --> 00:11:40,700
Oh, look.

127
00:11:47,881 --> 00:11:49,056
[shocked]

128
00:11:49,534 --> 00:11:51,798
-Hello my princess.
-Are you filming me?

129
00:11:51,972 --> 00:11:54,191
-Yes.
-Why?

130
00:11:54,365 --> 00:11:57,499
-So you can be in our movie.
-Why would I want to be
in your movie?

131
00:11:57,804 --> 00:12:02,417
Because I am the hero,
you will be the princess,
and I will earn a kiss.

132
00:12:03,548 --> 00:12:04,593
[laughs]

133
00:12:05,594 --> 00:12:06,769
You're kidding right?

134
00:12:09,816 --> 00:12:15,212
-OK wait a second,
am I being punked?
-What is this punked?

135
00:12:17,606 --> 00:12:21,828
Oh my god,
you're really serious
about earning a kiss?

136
00:12:22,002 --> 00:12:23,003
Yes.

137
00:12:24,134 --> 00:12:26,963
Good luck with that, freak!

138
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:34,144
-That didn't go so well.
-Do you have any suggestions?

139
00:12:35,015 --> 00:12:40,194
Yes, American girls,
they like aggressive guys.
So enough with charm,

140
00:12:40,368 --> 00:12:43,414
and chivalry.
Use some animal magnetism.

141
00:12:44,241 --> 00:12:47,027
-Maybe I should be the star
of this movie?
-Then give me the camera,

142
00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:49,681
-and you go try.
-I'm too, I don't-

143
00:12:49,856 --> 00:12:52,075
-You are not,
you go try now,
don't chicken.

144
00:12:52,249 --> 00:12:54,034
-I can't talk to a girl.
-Don't chicken.

145
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:55,818
-Don't make me,
I don't want to talk to a-
-OK.

146
00:12:59,387 --> 00:13:03,870
-Oh what about her?
-Excuse me,
what time is it?

147
00:13:04,044 --> 00:13:06,742
-Uh it is almost six.
-Do I know you?

148
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:11,486
-I don't think so.
-Nice antes,
I thought that

149
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:14,445
I recognized those.
You could be my princess?

150
00:13:14,619 --> 00:13:16,186
[slap]

151
00:13:16,621 --> 00:13:19,799
Not even in your dreams,
home boy.
Now get out of my way.

152
00:13:20,408 --> 00:13:22,018
Turn that damn camera off.

153
00:13:22,932 --> 00:13:26,327
-Do not film my butt.
-I can't help it.

154
00:13:26,675 --> 00:13:31,245
-It is a large and nice one.
-I want to see her
slap you again.

155
00:13:43,648 --> 00:13:47,522
One day we are
going to get a star
on the walk of fame.

156
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:02,624
-Our movie is a flop.
-How can you say that?

157
00:14:03,016 --> 00:14:05,670
-You are no hero.
-And you are no director.

158
00:14:06,323 --> 00:14:09,936
How dare you insult me?
And since when are you
a film critic?

159
00:14:12,112 --> 00:14:15,245
Instead of giving you a kiss,
all your princesses keep
telling you to kiss their ass.

160
00:14:19,423 --> 00:14:22,774
Is there anything you would
like to talk about?
Maybe something from your past?

161
00:14:23,775 --> 00:14:26,604
-What would you like to know?
-I don't know,
why don't we start

162
00:14:26,778 --> 00:14:28,171
with the nurse you were
fucking before me?

163
00:14:32,523 --> 00:14:37,267
-Really it wasn't on the news?
She went crazy,
kidnapped her?

164
00:14:37,441 --> 00:14:38,442
[laughing]

165
00:14:38,616 --> 00:14:40,836
-Oh, that.
-[hums]

166
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:45,623
That was just you know,
that was just
an unfortunate misunderstanding.

167
00:14:45,797 --> 00:14:48,800
OK, so what kind of
misfortunate understanding,
is there going to be,

168
00:14:48,975 --> 00:14:51,673
-when she finds out about me?
-She won't.

169
00:14:53,196 --> 00:14:56,460
-She's obviously dangerous.
-Not anymore.

170
00:14:57,026 --> 00:15:01,639
-And you're,
you're sure of that?
-I took care of that problem.

171
00:15:03,076 --> 00:15:04,120
How?

172
00:15:05,078 --> 00:15:08,124
Let's just say that eventually,
you will see.

173
00:15:08,298 --> 00:15:09,299
[laughing]

174
00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:12,520
Why are you even
with someone like this?

175
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:18,352
Because her family is rich.
She has a trust fund,

176
00:15:18,526 --> 00:15:24,401
I mean let's just say
that she's like,
my insurance policy.

177
00:15:24,836 --> 00:15:28,188
In case anything
ever goes south,
which is not likely to happen.

178
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:31,539
Oh my god,
you're a piece of work.

179
00:15:31,756 --> 00:15:34,194
Oh my,
what does this say about me?
Do I need therapy?

180
00:15:34,368 --> 00:15:37,545
Do I?
What's your professional opinion
on me?

181
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:42,028
-Well I couldn't help you.
That is a conflict of interest.
- Oh that would be immoral.

182
00:15:42,376 --> 00:15:44,378
-Do you know what's not
a conflict of interest?
-[hums]

183
00:15:44,552 --> 00:15:48,077
OK, yeah?
Me and my little friend here.

184
00:15:48,251 --> 00:15:51,559
-Oh!
-Yeah, if you wife even comes
near me,

185
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,823
I'm going to blast that bitch,
to next week.

186
00:15:55,476 --> 00:15:56,477
[cell phone rings]

187
00:16:00,307 --> 00:16:01,308
Dr. Tucker?

188
00:16:05,442 --> 00:16:06,443
[clears throat]

189
00:16:09,794 --> 00:16:12,580
Is everything OK?
Is it your wife?

190
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:16,627
-Operator.
-This is Dr. Douglas Tucker,
from County Hospital.

191
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:20,980
We had an escape
in our psychiatric ward,
double escape.

192
00:16:29,423 --> 00:16:33,949
A real hero is not discouraged,
by rejection.

193
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:39,737
You're a romantic fool.
The worst kind of idiot.

194
00:16:40,173 --> 00:16:45,178
We have just been looking
for the wrong type of female.
In order to be a hero,

195
00:16:46,353 --> 00:16:50,139
I must save a woman,
from a terrible situation.

196
00:16:50,487 --> 00:16:55,405
-That way I will earn my kiss.
-Do you have any idea how stupid
you sound right now?

197
00:16:56,493 --> 00:16:59,366
Women today enjoy
their problems.
It's their excuse

198
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:03,544
-for everything.
-We will just find a woman,
with great moral fiber.

199
00:17:07,243 --> 00:17:09,245
-Here in this town?
-[police radio]

200
00:17:10,725 --> 00:17:14,120
-Car 47 reporting back.
-Two mental patients have
escaped from the psychiatric

00:17:14,294 --> 00:17:15,904

[car starts]

203
00:17:33,226 --> 00:17:35,358
I'm tired I'm going to head in,
I'll see you later.

204
00:17:45,629 --> 00:17:48,284
That is our princess,
I am sure of it.

205
00:17:48,893 --> 00:17:50,982
She looks like she needs
to be saved.

206
00:17:51,548 --> 00:17:55,987
-From what?
-I do not know.
But I am going to find out.

207
00:17:56,988 --> 00:17:59,469
-Prepare yourself.
-Prepare yourself.

208
00:18:00,253 --> 00:18:01,515
That girl is going to slap you.

209
00:18:24,015 --> 00:18:25,191
You following me?

210
00:18:31,632 --> 00:18:34,722
-You better not be cops.
-Do we look like cops?

211
00:18:35,462 --> 00:18:37,507
No but that would be the point,
wouldn't it?

212
00:18:39,596 --> 00:18:41,903
-Turn that thing off.
-We are making a movie.

213
00:18:43,165 --> 00:18:47,300
-About what?
-About a princess that I save,
I am the hero.

214
00:18:48,344 --> 00:18:51,086
-Is he retarded?
-Borderline.

215
00:18:53,088 --> 00:18:55,612
-What's your name?
-I am Fumnanya.

216
00:18:57,266 --> 00:19:01,357
Fuma-ya-ya, or whatever
the fuck it is.
What kind of a name is that?

217
00:19:02,663 --> 00:19:06,884
-African, I am Igbo.
-What's an Igbo?

218
00:19:07,668 --> 00:19:11,759
-It's my tribe.
-My tribe is horny men
with cash.

219
00:19:14,501 --> 00:19:18,287
-Who would stick you
with a name like that?
-My father.

220
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,901
It means "he who inspires love".

221
00:19:24,685 --> 00:19:26,948
Wow, and how has that
worked out for you?

222
00:19:31,474 --> 00:19:35,696
Trust me, "Fumnanya" is not
a hero's name.
With a name like that,

223
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:38,655
you'll never get the girl.
Any girl.

[lights cigarette]

225
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:52,365
-So, do you want a date or not?
-I am not sure.

226
00:19:53,627 --> 00:19:57,892
OK, if you want a date,
I live in the next block,
grey building, second floor.

227
00:19:58,545 --> 00:20:00,764
I'm easy to find.
I'm Candy.

228
00:20:02,462 --> 00:20:08,119
What, Candy?
That's so close to Andy,
she can't be your princess.

229
00:20:09,295 --> 00:20:12,820
You really don't see do you?
Your princess is a professional.

230
00:20:13,603 --> 00:20:15,257
A professional at what?

231
00:20:17,999 --> 00:20:19,827
Our movie is turning
into a farce.

232
00:20:23,439 --> 00:20:24,440

I am so sorry,
your door was open.

239
00:22:15,029 --> 00:22:16,073
Are you OK?

240
00:22:18,902 --> 00:22:20,208
You changed your mind?

241
00:22:23,124 --> 00:22:25,648
-Changed my mind?
-About a date.

242
00:22:30,871 --> 00:22:31,959
How do you like it?

243
00:22:34,483 --> 00:22:37,312
-Like what?
-Doesn't he get it?

244
00:22:37,704 --> 00:22:42,970
-He really doesn't seem to.
-I do though.
Maybe a little show and tell?

245
00:22:47,975 --> 00:22:50,934
Do you like it from the front?
Behind?

246
00:22:53,067 --> 00:22:54,677
I like it the traditional way.

247
00:22:56,113 --> 00:22:57,419
Why be so boring?

248
00:23:01,423 --> 00:23:07,037
-You've been with
a woman before right?
-Woman, lots of women.

249
00:23:08,561 --> 00:23:11,607
In my country,
I am number one.

250
00:23:16,612 --> 00:23:20,094
Oh, what a woman.

251
00:23:21,269 --> 00:23:22,401
Hear me roar.

252
00:23:28,494 --> 00:23:29,495
[shudders]

253
00:23:41,898 --> 00:23:47,121
That was a very short date,
did you enjoy yourself?

254
00:23:48,688 --> 00:23:50,690
Immensely enjoy.

255
00:23:51,865 --> 00:23:55,129
OK then,
how about 50 dollars?

256
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:58,828
-50 Dollar?
-Yeah, a discount,
just for you.

257
00:23:59,263 --> 00:24:02,832
-My hero.
-Pay the lady, Casanova.

258
00:24:03,006 --> 00:24:07,663
-Where am I supposed
to get 50 dollars?
-You don't have any money?

259
00:24:07,924 --> 00:24:12,276
Not 50 dollars,
my father did not
leave me nothing.

260
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:15,845
Some father,
sounds like mine.
What do you have?

261
00:24:20,676 --> 00:24:25,289
-I have zero dollars.
-12 dollars.

262
00:24:26,813 --> 00:24:29,337
You asshole!
Get the hell out of here!

263
00:24:32,035 --> 00:24:34,951
-That's 12 dollars,
that was like 30 seconds!

-Get out of here.
-You want like 24 dollars
a minute?

265
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:41,741
That's like 1440 dollars
an hour,
which is crazy money.

266
00:24:50,837 --> 00:24:54,971
-I apologize,
next time longer.
-Get out of here!

-Hello.

-Hi.
-What the hell is that?

269
00:25:01,412 --> 00:25:02,544
We're making a movie.

270
00:25:05,852 --> 00:25:08,158
-I thought you said
you never do porn?
-I'm not Roco,

271
00:25:08,332 --> 00:25:12,249
-I'm not doing porn.
-Who the fuck are you guys?

272
00:25:12,423 --> 00:25:14,687
-I am the hero.
-I'm Andy.

273
00:25:15,209 --> 00:25:16,384
He is our director.

274
00:25:24,174 --> 00:25:28,048
Is that what I think it is?
Is this yours or yours?
Hmm?

275
00:25:28,788 --> 00:25:32,661
-It's his.
-That's going to cost you hero.

00:25:32,879 --> 00:25:34,881
-100 bucks.
-100 dollars?

277
00:25:35,055 --> 00:25:37,840
-[hums]
-I was told by her,
only 50 dollars.

278
00:25:38,014 --> 00:25:41,148
It's 100 bucks,
or you're going to pay double,
for making a movie

279
00:25:41,322 --> 00:25:42,628
and for cumming on my floor.

280
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:47,371
-I don't have any more money.
-That's going to be a problem.

281
00:25:48,372 --> 00:25:50,984
-Is he the only
customer tonight?
-Yes.

282
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,944
Girl you're getting lazy on me,
I need money,
and I need lots of money.

283
00:25:55,118 --> 00:25:58,165
I give you everything I get OK?
And you spend it on coke,
and gambling,

284
00:25:58,339 --> 00:26:01,647
-that's not my fault.
-Shut up, OK?

285
00:26:01,864 --> 00:26:04,258
Leave her alone you gomgat!

286
00:26:06,869 --> 00:26:11,831
What the fuck did you call me?
Is that some sort of starter
Rhasta kit?

287
00:26:12,745 --> 00:26:14,485
-Watch yourself.
-He paid already.

288
00:26:15,095 --> 00:26:16,618
OK go home,
I'll get you your money.

289
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:22,755
OK, you better if you
know what's right.
Later boys.

[door shuts]

291
00:26:27,411 --> 00:26:28,412
What did you call him?

292
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:43,689
-Yeah Rocco?
-Listen to me,
I can't pay you tonight.

293
00:26:45,386 --> 00:26:46,866
Not tonight anyways, OK?

294
00:26:47,823 --> 00:26:50,043
-You should go.
-Go?

295
00:26:51,261 --> 00:26:53,742
He owes drug money
to the Russian mob,
they could show up at any time.

296
00:26:53,916 --> 00:26:56,527
-He's a fucking coke head.
-I will protect you.

297
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:01,489
-Explain to the camera
how you need protection.
-I'm a big girl,

298
00:27:01,663 --> 00:27:03,926
-I can take care of myself.
-For our movie.

299
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,409
-Oh.
I need protection.
-From who?

300
00:27:10,019 --> 00:27:12,369
-My boyfriend.
-He is not your boyfriend.

301
00:27:12,935 --> 00:27:15,677
-My pimp.
-I will be your guardian.

302
00:27:16,809 --> 00:27:20,464
-He will kill you.
-Maybe, but I will die honorably
protecting my woman.

303
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:23,859
-Oh now I am your woman?
-Yes, I have claimed you.

304
00:27:24,033 --> 00:27:27,776
-I do not belong to anybody.
-I am also your salvation.

305
00:27:28,037 --> 00:27:32,085
-It is the point of our movie.
-He's crazy.

306
00:27:32,694 --> 00:27:36,002
He's a hopeless romantic.
That's even worse than crazy.

307
00:27:43,444 --> 00:27:48,231
I think you're
a very nice person,
and I appreciate your offer.

308
00:27:48,884 --> 00:27:51,713
But, I don't want to see you
get hurt.

309
00:27:53,062 --> 00:27:55,586
I got myself into this mess,
it's up to me to get myself
out of it.

310
00:27:55,761 --> 00:27:58,677
Yeah I totally agree,
I mean this is on you.

311
00:28:02,942 --> 00:28:03,986
But I want to help.

312
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:08,774
I want to be your, prince.

313
00:28:09,775 --> 00:28:12,125
-That's sweet, but.
-But.

314
00:28:14,954 --> 00:28:16,999
-Nothing.
-Tell me.

315
00:28:19,872 --> 00:28:22,483
Tell me,
and you will feel better.

316
00:28:24,137 --> 00:28:26,400
No, I would feel worse.

317
00:28:33,973 --> 00:28:35,931
If she doesn't tell her secret,
kill her.

318
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:43,591
Look in the mirror,
if you see what I see,

319
00:28:45,201 --> 00:28:50,554
you are beautiful,
independent, highly intelligent.

320
00:28:55,864 --> 00:28:56,996
Can I have a drag?

321
00:29:03,785 --> 00:29:04,786
[coughs]

322
00:29:06,701 --> 00:29:08,572
Why do you do this to yourself?

323
00:29:14,143 --> 00:29:15,362
Can I use your bathroom?

324
00:29:17,538 --> 00:29:21,542
Wait get under the bed!
Get under the bed, quick!

325
00:29:25,111 --> 00:29:28,331
-I told you to go home.
-I need money and tonight.

326
00:29:29,376 --> 00:29:32,161
-I'm not going back out again,
I'm tired.
-Why?

327
00:29:32,335 --> 00:29:34,903
-You haven't been working
all day.
-Go home.

328
00:29:35,686 --> 00:29:39,647
Look I have to pay my debt
to the Russians,
and unless you have some kind

329
00:29:39,821 --> 00:29:43,433
of cash around here that
you haven't told me about,
I have to pay with you now.

330
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:46,349
-That's not funny.
-It's not supposed to be.

331
00:29:46,567 --> 00:29:49,613
-OK you belong to me, so.
-Fuck you!

332
00:29:50,223 --> 00:29:51,224
[slaps]

333
00:29:52,051 --> 00:29:53,052
Stay down.

334
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:56,795
[undoes pants]

335
00:29:56,969 --> 00:29:58,884
-No I'm not doing that.
-Don't make me hit you again.

336
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:00,799
-No.
-No do nothing.

337
00:30:00,973 --> 00:30:04,454
-Shit!
-Don't make me hurt you, nigger.

338
00:30:04,628 --> 00:30:09,329
-Hey!
-I am no nigger.
I am a Igbo prince!

339
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,555
Get out of here
or I'm calling 911!

340
00:30:24,866 --> 00:30:26,215
That's not gonna save you.

341
00:30:27,651 --> 00:30:30,741
-Or him,
your nigger prince.
-Get the fuck out of here.

342
00:30:31,786 --> 00:30:32,831
Later.

343
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:34,963
[gasping]

344
00:30:35,311 --> 00:30:36,312
Are you OK?

345
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,145
-You scared him away.
-I did?

346
00:30:44,233 --> 00:30:47,584
-Yeah, you did.
-I scared him away.

347
00:30:49,891 --> 00:30:50,979
I am the hero.

348
00:30:52,763 --> 00:30:57,638
I am hero.
I am your hero!
We can get married now.

349
00:30:58,987 --> 00:31:02,121
I am your hero,
yes I am the hero.

350
00:31:02,469 --> 00:31:03,470
[hip hop music]

351
00:31:07,953 --> 00:31:09,911
-Aren't you packing?
-Packing?

352
00:31:11,521 --> 00:31:14,046
-Don't you have a gun?
-I don't like guns.

353
00:31:14,481 --> 00:31:16,875
Oh, how charming.

354
00:31:17,092 --> 00:31:18,093
[laughs]

355
00:31:22,706 --> 00:31:26,580
This is my rainy day fund.
Rocco doesn't know I have it.

356
00:31:27,233 --> 00:31:29,975
So let me throw on a dress,
and I will take you guys
to a nice dinner.

357
00:31:30,323 --> 00:31:32,978
-OK.
-OK.

358
00:31:33,152 --> 00:31:35,502
-OK, wait in the living room.
-Do you want me to film you,
while you pick out a dress?

359
00:31:35,676 --> 00:31:38,679
-I'm good, thanks.
-OK.

360
00:31:49,733 --> 00:31:54,347
-I will take care of Rocco.
-Rocco is not my problem.

361
00:31:54,651 --> 00:31:57,393
-I will take care
of the Russians too.
-You would need a gun

362
00:31:57,567 --> 00:32:01,571
to do that.
But that's OK,
they're not my problem either.

363
00:32:05,314 --> 00:32:10,363
Rocco and the Russians
are just symptoms,
the problem is me.

364
00:32:13,496 --> 00:32:16,804
-Turn that thing on,
I want this in the movie.
-You will be in our movie?

365
00:32:18,066 --> 00:32:21,983
-I already am.
-You are my princess,
I knew it from the start.

366
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:28,947
I don't think I've ever been
anyone's princess.
And it's too late for that now.

367
00:32:29,208 --> 00:32:32,951
-It is never too late.
-That's sweet.

368
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:37,825
But the only thing
that can save me,
is death.

369
00:32:38,782 --> 00:32:43,178
-That's how I want
this movie to end.
-You want us to kill you?

370
00:32:43,352 --> 00:32:46,703
No, I want you
to help me kill myself.

371
00:32:49,228 --> 00:32:52,971
I cannot do that,
you are my woman,
I am the hero.

372
00:32:53,145 --> 00:32:56,931
-And a hero would never
kill his woman.
-Are you crazy?

373
00:32:58,237 --> 00:33:02,937
I am not sure.
Dr. Tucker thinks I am crazy,
but he is not even

374
00:33:03,111 --> 00:33:06,158
a real psychiatrist.
That's why we had to escape
from the hospital.

375
00:33:06,332 --> 00:33:11,032
-You escaped from a?
-The only reason I was there,
is because my father,

376
00:33:11,206 --> 00:33:13,687
paid Dr. Tucker to be rid of me.

377
00:33:16,385 --> 00:33:19,867
-You escaped from
a mental hospital?
-Yes.

378
00:33:21,129 --> 00:33:25,351
-So you are crazy?
-We are all a little crazy,
it is part

379
00:33:25,525 --> 00:33:29,398
of the human condition.
But I am no crazier,
than anyone else.

380
00:33:30,182 --> 00:33:33,185
Great, I've been adopted
by two lunatics.

381
00:33:34,403 --> 00:33:39,452
Have you decided
how you're going to do it yet?
Suffocation, drowning?

382
00:33:40,975 --> 00:33:43,891
-I need to think about it
some more.
-You know what I've been

383
00:33:44,065 --> 00:33:46,676
thinking about?
You guys
are pretty much nobodies.

384
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:48,939
So I don't know who
is going to want to distribute
this movie?

385
00:33:50,463 --> 00:33:54,728
We could just put in on YouTube?
It could go viral,
and we would be famous.

386
00:33:56,425 --> 00:34:01,648
That is a great idea, viral.
Everybody searches
the web nowadays.

387
00:34:01,822 --> 00:34:05,565
Wait, hold on a minute.
I'm starting to see
a lot of the things

388
00:34:05,739 --> 00:34:07,697
that I see when I go
off my medication.

389
00:34:08,394 --> 00:34:10,178
I really need
to find some medication.

390
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:15,096
-Do you remember the address,
to Dr. Tucker's house?
-What?

391
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:19,579
-The Nurse told us,
as we were escaping.
-Oh, 4218 Bearmounts Blvd.

392
00:34:24,845 --> 00:34:25,715
Check this out.

[snapping fingers]

394
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,894
-What did you give her?
-Chloral hydrate.

395
00:34:31,547 --> 00:34:34,637
-How?
-In her dinner, she's going
to be passed out for hours.

396
00:34:34,811 --> 00:34:38,119
-OK, but isn't she going to be
suspicious that she just
passed out?

397
00:34:38,337 --> 00:34:41,209
No, I told her she has
a brain tumor,
and is going to start suffering

398
00:34:41,383 --> 00:34:42,906
some blackouts.
[laughs]

399
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:46,823
-Hey come on!
I got a surprise for you.
-OK.

400
00:34:46,997 --> 00:34:48,042
-Some Spice.
-Yeah?

401
00:34:48,216 --> 00:34:49,304
-Yeah.
-OK.

402
00:34:56,137 --> 00:34:57,399
Get down, get down!

403

406
00:35:07,888 --> 00:35:09,585
-You're not going to hurt me
with that thing are you?
-Frankly darling,

407
00:35:09,759 --> 00:35:13,198
-I don't give a damn!
-Oh yeah!

408
00:35:14,024 --> 00:35:18,377
-What is so funny?
-He's dressed like Rhett Butler,
from gone with the wind!

409
00:35:20,683 --> 00:35:25,210
Oh Atlanta is on fire Rhett!
Ride me home to Tara!

410
00:35:26,385 --> 00:35:29,562
-Take it like a southern belle!
Alright!
-Yee haw!

He is beating that woman,
like a horse in a triple grand.

-Right there!

-Yeah!

414
00:35:39,615 --> 00:35:44,316
No, again?
Surely the south
will rise again?

416
00:35:46,274 --> 00:35:49,625

God, it's all,
it's all sticky.

417
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:52,498
-What was that?
-Oh he sees us.

00:35:55,196 --> 00:36:01,202
-It's the Raccoons.
-You!

00:36:07,121 --> 00:36:11,473
-Scarpeli.
-Hi this is Rhett,
I mean this is Dr. Tucker,

422
00:36:11,647 --> 00:36:17,131
from County Hospital.
Yeah I have been victim,
of an attempted home invasion.

423
00:36:17,697 --> 00:36:20,265
-Did you see them?
-Is anybody injured?

424
00:36:20,439 --> 00:36:22,789
-Yeah, no.
-How many perpetrators?

425
00:36:22,963 --> 00:36:26,880
-Two men and a woman.
-A woman?

426
00:36:28,229 --> 00:36:32,059
-I think she's a hostage.
-Well what makes you say that?

427
00:36:32,233 --> 00:36:36,672
Because they're escaped
patients of mine,
with sexual delusions.

428
00:36:36,846 --> 00:36:42,243
-Do you think the woman,
was kidnapped by the crazies?
-Yes.

429
00:36:42,548 --> 00:36:45,594
-So these loonies are dangerous?
-Definitely dangerous.

430
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:49,381
-OK, do you think
they are armed?
-Yes.

431
00:36:50,077 --> 00:36:54,168
OK, I will call in a new APB.
We will get these guys.

You were serious before?

-Yes.
-Why?

440
00:37:28,376 --> 00:37:31,161
I'm sick of this shit,
this life.

441
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,425
It's no life.

442
00:37:34,687 --> 00:37:39,518
OK, I will help you.
But you must help me.

443
00:37:42,129 --> 00:37:43,173
How?

444
00:37:47,439 --> 00:37:50,964
Bye giving me a kiss,
when you are ready
to say goodbye.

445
00:37:52,661 --> 00:37:53,662
A kiss?

446
00:37:54,837 --> 00:37:58,798
-That's all you want?
-That is all I want.

447
00:38:01,888 --> 00:38:05,065
It's not too much to ask for,
under the circumstances.

448
00:38:08,982 --> 00:38:10,070
That is all I need.

449
00:38:15,641 --> 00:38:17,295
OK, deal.

450
00:38:18,383 --> 00:38:19,862
-Deal.
-Deal.

451
00:38:24,824 --> 00:38:26,521
Are you sure,
that you want to do this?

452
00:38:29,655 --> 00:38:31,134
Losing your nerve already huh?

453
00:38:37,489 --> 00:38:38,838
There is one thing.

454
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:43,669
I would like to see
my grandmother,
before I die.

455
00:38:43,973 --> 00:38:46,454
Your grandmother?
What about your family?

456
00:38:49,152 --> 00:38:50,153
I don't care about them.

457
00:38:52,939 --> 00:38:54,332
What would you say
to your grandmother?

458
00:38:59,162 --> 00:39:02,992
-Old people are really gross.
-Does she have all of her teeth?

459
00:39:03,645 --> 00:39:06,996
-Is she like a really gross one?
-Does her breasts hang down,
to the floor?

00:39:07,301 --> 00:39:08,346
[laughing]

461
00:39:23,491 --> 00:39:27,234
-You have to be careful,
around my grandma.
-Why because she is old?

462
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:33,414
-Because Candy isn't
my real name.
-Are you serious?

463
00:39:33,588 --> 00:39:35,721
It's my working name.

464
00:39:37,331 --> 00:39:39,420
What is your real name?

465
00:39:40,552 --> 00:39:42,945
-Emily.
-Emily.

466
00:39:45,034 --> 00:39:49,604
-Is there something wrong
with Emily?
-No it's just,

467
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:53,521
-I like Candy better.
-Not me.

468
00:39:54,609 --> 00:39:56,785
Well just watch yourself
around my grandma?

469
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,008
-See that house up there?
-[grunts]

470
00:40:02,487 --> 00:40:03,662
That's granny's house.

[doorbell rings]

472
00:40:07,579 --> 00:40:08,797
You think she is alive?

-Hi!

476
00:40:24,465 --> 00:40:28,600
-Turn that off,
I'm old and ugly.
-Oh we're making a movie.

477
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:34,344
-Oh, about what?
-About a journey.

478
00:40:35,171 --> 00:40:38,827
-Well no one wants to see me.
-I wanted to see you.

479
00:40:39,524 --> 00:40:41,787
-And here you are!
-Here I am.

480
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,443
These are my friends.
This is Fumnanya,
that's Andy.

481
00:40:46,792 --> 00:40:51,231
-Fumnanya, African?
-Nigerian.

00:40:54,539 --> 00:40:58,804
-You're Emily's friends
from the city?
-Yes.

483
00:41:00,153 --> 00:41:04,940
Well come on in,
I'll make you a good supper.
You must be hungry.

484
00:41:05,419 --> 00:41:10,990
-Oh lord,
we thank you for this meal-
-Do you have any hot sauce?

485
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:14,950
Oh, no, no.

486
00:41:18,824 --> 00:41:24,525
Thank you for this meal,
and for Emily's visit,
and for your grace.

487
00:41:25,265 --> 00:41:31,401
Please forgive us our sins,
and have mercy on our souls,
amen.

488
00:41:32,272 --> 00:41:35,231
-Amen.
-Which man do you speak of?

489
00:41:36,363 --> 00:41:37,407
A man?

490
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:39,497
[awkward laughter]

491
00:41:43,239 --> 00:41:47,330
Oh I'm so happy
to see you, Emily.

492
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:53,206
So this journey,
tell me about
where you're going?

493
00:41:55,687 --> 00:41:56,688
Paris.

494
00:41:58,864 --> 00:42:02,432
Paris?
What are you going to do there?

495
00:42:03,216 --> 00:42:08,221
-Construction worker.
-No, no, I...

496
00:42:08,569 --> 00:42:12,660
I was offered a job.
Working for an artist.

497
00:42:15,097 --> 00:42:20,755
-Oh an artist,
that is so romantic.
-That is how we met.

498
00:42:21,364 --> 00:42:22,714
I am an artist also.

499
00:42:22,975 --> 00:42:23,976
[awkward sighing]

500
00:42:27,588 --> 00:42:32,854
-Maybe you will find someone
to marry in Paris.
-Yeah, maybe.

501
00:42:36,336 --> 00:42:39,905
I just wish you weren't
going so far away.
I feel like we won't

502
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:44,300
-see each other again.
-That is a good possibility.

503
00:42:46,259 --> 00:42:48,043
I need a new life.

504
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:55,660
Oh we all do.
Especially those of us who are
old and decrepit.

505
00:42:55,834 --> 00:42:56,835
[awkward laughter]

506
00:42:58,053 --> 00:43:00,055
I appreciate your honesty.

507
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:12,720
I feel like,
we will never be together again.

508
00:43:13,155 --> 00:43:15,941
Why would you say that?
Of course we will.

509
00:43:17,377 --> 00:43:18,421
I'm old.

510
00:43:19,814 --> 00:43:22,991
Old enough to know,
I don't have much
longer to live.

511
00:43:23,165 --> 00:43:27,909
And you are young,
with your whole life
ahead of you.

512
00:43:28,431 --> 00:43:32,087
At my age,
you wake up every morning,
and you wonder,

513
00:43:32,261 --> 00:43:33,872
if it's going to be your last?

514
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:40,792
You know Jesus,
he knew for certain,

515
00:43:40,966 --> 00:43:42,750
that this was his last supper.

516
00:43:44,491 --> 00:43:47,929
I worry that this is going
to be my last supper.

517
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:52,499
Oh, thank you.

518
00:43:55,415 --> 00:43:58,244
Oh you're too young
to worry about death.

519
00:43:59,332 --> 00:44:03,292
You have to cherish
every day that you're alive.

520
00:44:03,466 --> 00:44:06,948
Life is a wonderful gift.

521
00:44:08,471 --> 00:44:13,259
A wonderful gift.
Eat, it's getting cold.

522
00:44:18,046 --> 00:44:20,875
Fresh apple pie,
your favorite.

523
00:44:24,183 --> 00:44:26,751
I put a little something special
in it for your journey.

524
00:44:28,753 --> 00:44:30,972
Did you tell your mother
and father,
you're moving to Paris?

525
00:44:31,756 --> 00:44:35,150
-Dad hates me.
-He's still your father.

526
00:44:36,935 --> 00:44:41,591
Your father is flawed,
like we all are,
but he's not a bad man.

527
00:44:42,244 --> 00:44:44,682
-I wish you would forgive him.
-You tell him.

528
00:44:46,031 --> 00:44:47,423
I'm in a hurry to get to Paris.

529
00:44:54,343 --> 00:44:55,693
Take care of yourself.

530
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:02,221
[car starts]

531
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:13,232
-We are perfect for each other,
you know?
-We are?

532
00:45:14,537 --> 00:45:17,715
We have a lot in common.
My father hated me too.

533
00:45:19,847 --> 00:45:22,328
So what method of suicide,
do you want to employ?

534
00:45:24,199 --> 00:45:27,246
Hello again,
this is my woman Candy.

535
00:45:28,116 --> 00:45:30,858
We are here
at the Hardware store,
because Candy

536
00:45:31,032 --> 00:45:32,077
is tired of living.

537
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:38,257
The method of suicide
that she has chosen,
is to hang herself.

538
00:45:39,998 --> 00:45:43,741
Which is very good
for our movie,
because it is so picturesque.

539
00:45:45,264 --> 00:45:48,397
At the end of our movie,
I will receive a kiss.

540
00:45:49,268 --> 00:45:51,357
Which means a happy ending.
A kiss from a-

541
00:45:51,531 --> 00:45:54,577
Stop talking about being happy.
It's a tragedy, OK?

542
00:45:55,970 --> 00:46:00,192
Now what we have to do,
is go in the store,
and buy rope.

543
00:46:04,631 --> 00:46:06,633
Nobody's happy,
at the end of a tragedy.

544
00:46:18,253 --> 00:46:21,300
May I help you?
I prefer not to be filmed.

545
00:46:21,909 --> 00:46:24,129
-We are making a movie.
-About what?

546
00:46:24,303 --> 00:46:27,915
-It is a modern day remake,
of Romeo and Juliet.
-And it takes place

547
00:46:28,089 --> 00:46:31,658
-in a Hardware store?
-Don't be foolish,
we are here to buy some rope.

548
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:34,269
-For the movie?
-For mountaineering.

549
00:46:34,443 --> 00:46:38,404
-Exactly.
-Romeo and Juliet are going
to be mountaineering?

550
00:46:39,318 --> 00:46:41,320
-You must be Juliet.
-Yes.

551
00:46:41,494 --> 00:46:44,845
-You look like
a fine actress to me.
-That is nice rope.

552
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:49,850
-That is polyester,
and it's not strong enough.
-How about that one there?

553
00:46:50,372 --> 00:46:53,462
What you need is manilla.

554
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:56,161
Strong weather resistant.
How much do you need?

555
00:47:02,645 --> 00:47:04,822
-About 15 feet.
-That's all?

556
00:47:05,126 --> 00:47:08,173
-That'll suffice.
-Have you guys ever been
mountaineering before?

557
00:47:08,651 --> 00:47:09,827
All the time.

558
00:47:12,568 --> 00:47:14,832
OK, is there anything else
that I can get you?

559
00:47:17,225 --> 00:47:21,621
A shovel, a plastic bag,
and some lime.

560
00:47:22,883 --> 00:47:23,884
Lime?

561
00:47:28,715 --> 00:47:29,803
Freeze it right here.

562
00:47:33,241 --> 00:47:36,810
-Julia Roberts, with red hair.
-It's so good.

563
00:47:36,984 --> 00:47:39,552
-It's very good.
-Hollywood here I come!

564
00:47:39,726 --> 00:47:43,121
Hollywood we will all come!
We will come together.

565
00:47:44,513 --> 00:47:45,558
That's a lot of coming.

566
00:47:47,168 --> 00:47:52,652
-I am so handsome here,
stoic, powerful,-
-Sweaty.

567
00:47:52,826 --> 00:47:56,786
It was hot inside the store.
I am the next Denzel Washington.

568
00:47:59,006 --> 00:48:01,574
-I see an Oscar in my future.
-What is this thing?

569
00:48:01,966 --> 00:48:02,967
-This?
-Yeah.

570
00:48:03,141 --> 00:48:04,316
-Oh it's a mouse.
-Oh.

571
00:48:05,665 --> 00:48:07,580
-No.
-It's OK,
it's OK.

572
00:48:07,754 --> 00:48:09,408
-I don't like mice.
-Andy!

573
00:48:09,582 --> 00:48:12,367
-I don't like mice!
-Andy it is not a real mouse.

574
00:48:13,281 --> 00:48:15,414
Just don't flip it upside down,
I don't want to see
its belly again.

575
00:48:16,806 --> 00:48:19,200
Is this a robot?
Is this like a robot mouse?

576
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:24,989
He is like an elephant,
afraid of mouse.

577
00:48:26,033 --> 00:48:27,252
Hey I don't ever forget.

578
00:48:29,384 --> 00:48:31,560
-It's OK Andy.
-Just keep it away from me OK?

579
00:48:31,734 --> 00:48:33,214
-We all remember.
-OK.

580
00:48:34,563 --> 00:48:38,306
-You're doing good work.
-Great work, Andy.

581
00:48:39,046 --> 00:48:41,570
-Thank you.
-You have an eye like a bird.

582
00:48:44,878 --> 00:48:45,923
[digging]

583
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:51,754
-Hurry up!
-I am digging as fast as I can.

584
00:48:59,458 --> 00:49:02,635
-It's not big enough.
-It is big enough.

585
00:49:03,027 --> 00:49:06,378
-I'm too tall.
-Does it matter?

586
00:49:06,682 --> 00:49:08,119
Soon you will be dead.

587
00:49:10,251 --> 00:49:11,644
I just want everything
to be right.

588
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:16,997
What the hell is that?
Little terrifying little girl.

589
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:21,306
-Are you playing a game?
-This looks like a game to you?

590
00:49:21,567 --> 00:49:25,136
-Grave diggers?
-Is there such a game?

591
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:29,662
-I think so.
-I think that you should
be going home.

592
00:49:29,836 --> 00:49:30,968
Aren't your parents worried
about you?

593
00:49:33,492 --> 00:49:38,540
I tell you what,
you can stay,
and be in our movie.

594
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:41,979
-What is your name?
-Amy.

595
00:49:42,153 --> 00:49:46,200
-Yeah right.
I mean her name is Candy,
but it's really Emily.

596
00:49:46,374 --> 00:49:48,898
She says it's Candy,
how am I supposed to believe
your name is really Amy?

597
00:49:51,205 --> 00:49:55,253
Well Amy,
you are in our movie now.
Is there something

598
00:49:55,427 --> 00:49:59,213
-you would like to say?
Into the camera.
-I wish my daddy were home.

599
00:50:00,867 --> 00:50:02,173
What's your movie about?

600
00:50:04,044 --> 00:50:06,090
-It is a fairy tale.
-I like fairy tales.

601
00:50:06,264 --> 00:50:09,789
So do I.
Well it is time to get
little Amy home,

602
00:50:09,963 --> 00:50:14,228
come come.
We want you to get
plenty of rest.

603
00:50:14,837 --> 00:50:18,058
That way you could grow up
big and strong,
and very smart.

604
00:50:18,232 --> 00:50:22,715
And one day you too could be
a director like Andy.
OK?

605
00:50:23,585 --> 00:50:27,372
-It was a pleasure to meet you.
-It was pleasure
to meet you too.

606
00:50:27,546 --> 00:50:29,722
Alrighty then,
night night.

607
00:50:32,203 --> 00:50:33,334
Hop hop,
hop hop!

608
00:50:36,598 --> 00:50:37,947
Girl gave me the willies.

609
00:50:43,127 --> 00:50:44,128
[fire crackles]

610
00:50:53,006 --> 00:50:54,790
Something is wrong.

611
00:50:58,403 --> 00:50:59,317
Oh!

612
00:50:59,491 --> 00:51:00,492
[coughing]

613
00:51:01,536 --> 00:51:02,711
Oh you blew it!

614
00:51:05,192 --> 00:51:06,672
I got it, I got it, I got it.

615
00:51:07,151 --> 00:51:08,108
[fire extinguishes]

616
00:51:08,282 --> 00:51:09,283
[coughing]

617
00:51:16,856 --> 00:51:19,728
It is closed.
That's why.

618
00:51:21,208 --> 00:51:23,428
Maybe that would have been
something to check
before you tried to light it?

619
00:51:29,216 --> 00:51:31,740
It's going to be OK, hold on.
Let me clear out the smoke.

620
00:51:33,177 --> 00:51:35,788
Let me clear it out.
I will get everything perfect.

621
00:51:36,702 --> 00:51:40,358
Everything will be perfect.
I shall get the mood back.

622
00:51:40,793 --> 00:51:42,055
Give me one minute.

623
00:51:44,884 --> 00:51:45,928
[striking match]

624
00:51:58,245 --> 00:52:01,118
Hey genius,
you can't light wet wood.

625
00:52:02,293 --> 00:52:05,948
-It will light when
the wood is dry.
-Yeah no why don't you

626
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:09,387
turn this light off,
we'll get this mood going
that you keep talking about.

627
00:52:22,051 --> 00:52:23,183
Ladies and gentlemen,

628
00:52:24,445 --> 00:52:28,362
it is Candy's last
evening alive.
It must be special.

629
00:52:28,884 --> 00:52:33,150
In a moment,
she will be relieved,
of all her sadness.

630
00:52:33,367 --> 00:52:38,024
But first,
as the hero,
I must make her happy.

631
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:44,248
Because no princess,
should die sad.

632
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:48,948
Granny's apple pie.

633
00:52:50,471 --> 00:52:53,822
-Oh shit!
-Look at this.

634
00:52:55,041 --> 00:52:59,001
It is a miracle!
Granny is an angel
from the heavens!

635
00:53:05,225 --> 00:53:08,010
Is, everything OK?

636
00:53:10,448 --> 00:53:11,449
No.

637
00:53:13,755 --> 00:53:14,756
I have a secret.

638
00:53:16,802 --> 00:53:18,195
I was pregnant once.

639
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:22,721
I always wanted a little girl.

640
00:53:25,811 --> 00:53:27,334
But I had an abortion.

641
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:32,034
I was sorry the very
next morning.

642
00:53:34,646 --> 00:53:35,647
But it was too late.

643
00:53:39,346 --> 00:53:41,479
All of a sudden
I didn't care about
anything anymore.

644
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:46,135
From that point on,
my thought every morning,
was that I wished

645
00:53:46,310 --> 00:53:47,659
I would never wake up again.

646
00:53:53,012 --> 00:53:54,666
-It's time to make good
on that wish.

647
00:53:56,145 --> 00:53:57,625
My father called me stupid.

648
00:54:00,715 --> 00:54:02,674
He told me I would never amount
to anything.

649
00:54:05,981 --> 00:54:06,982
That has come true.

650
00:54:08,549 --> 00:54:09,550
I failed at school.

651
00:54:11,944 --> 00:54:15,469
He told me the spirits
of my ancestors,
would haunt me

652
00:54:15,643 --> 00:54:18,603
the rest of my life,
because of a big disappointment
to them.

653
00:54:19,473 --> 00:54:24,391
So one day I went to school and
locked myself in the classroom,

654
00:54:25,349 --> 00:54:26,350
and set a fire.

655
00:54:29,396 --> 00:54:33,182
It's funny,
it's the only time that
I felt strong,

656
00:54:33,574 --> 00:54:34,575
and powerful.

657
00:54:38,536 --> 00:54:42,583
Teachers and students
were leaping out of the window,
to escape the fire.

658
00:54:44,629 --> 00:54:48,110
I fainted from the smoke,
a fireman,
he saved me.

659
00:54:50,112 --> 00:54:51,853
When my father heard
what I had done,

660
00:54:54,073 --> 00:54:56,293
he told me he wished
that I had died in that fire.

661
00:55:00,253 --> 00:55:01,298
My mother,

662
00:55:02,386 --> 00:55:03,648
died when I was born.

663
00:55:05,171 --> 00:55:06,215
My father blamed me.

664
00:55:09,741 --> 00:55:12,047
He said he wished my mother
had given birth to a dog.

665
00:55:13,048 --> 00:55:15,399
Because at least a dog,
would have some value.

666
00:55:22,841 --> 00:55:23,842
[sniffling]

667
00:55:26,192 --> 00:55:30,979
Look at me,
I'm supposed to make you happy,
and I am making myself cry.

668
00:55:33,765 --> 00:55:36,463
Andy my friend,
please turn off the camera.

669
00:55:36,637 --> 00:55:40,032
-The audience not supposed
to see the hero crying.
-You're a human being.

670
00:55:40,249 --> 00:55:41,555
It's OK to cry.

671
00:55:44,689 --> 00:55:46,038
It's OK to cry.

672
00:55:50,564 --> 00:55:52,523
-My friends.
-You're unique.

673
00:55:53,698 --> 00:55:54,699
You hear that Andy?

674
00:55:57,049 --> 00:55:59,573
-I am unique.
-Yeah, yeah you are.

675
00:56:01,793 --> 00:56:04,012
Andy, grab the camera.

676
00:56:11,019 --> 00:56:13,326
There is only one thing,
for Romeo to do.

677
00:56:14,936 --> 00:56:16,242
One more time.

678
00:56:18,766 --> 00:56:22,074
There is only one thing left,
for Romeo to do.

679
00:56:23,554 --> 00:56:25,382
and that is to hang his Juliet.

680
00:56:31,866 --> 00:56:35,957
Everything is to be tested.
It must work perfectly!

681
00:56:36,349 --> 00:56:37,611
This is our big scene.

682
00:56:38,351 --> 00:56:39,396
[chair falls]

683
00:56:41,963 --> 00:56:43,008
[choking]

684
00:56:44,575 --> 00:56:48,709
-Aren't you going to help?
-This is pure cinema
shock value.

685
00:56:49,449 --> 00:56:51,538
The audience will have
a lot more sympathy for him,
if they believe

686
00:56:51,712 --> 00:56:52,800
he's going to die.

687
00:56:54,193 --> 00:56:55,586
OK, OK.

688
00:57:06,988 --> 00:57:08,555
I believe it works properly.

689
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:16,389
Stop it!
Stop, I'm going to make you
eat it.

690
00:57:18,783 --> 00:57:23,527
-So what the fuck is this?
-It's a sexual quark.

691
00:57:25,964 --> 00:57:29,315
-You want to kill yourself?
-Not exactly.

692
00:57:29,968 --> 00:57:33,319
-What then?
-I would like for her
to hang me,

693
00:57:33,711 --> 00:57:36,191
and then cut me down,
before I am dead,
and then we will have sex.

694
00:57:36,365 --> 00:57:38,237
Oh god I've heard
everything now.
But you know what?

695
00:57:38,411 --> 00:57:41,066
-This is going to cost you.
-He already paid.

696
00:57:41,893 --> 00:57:45,287
-No he didn't.
-How much did he pay?

697
00:57:46,985 --> 00:57:47,986
A lot.

698
00:57:54,166 --> 00:57:57,474
I still need more.
But make this his big night
for him, OK?

699
00:57:57,648 --> 00:58:00,389
You know me,
customers always get
their money's worth.

700
00:58:02,348 --> 00:58:03,349
To each his own.

701
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:07,484
You should try it some time,
I'm telling you,
it is fun.

702
00:58:11,139 --> 00:58:13,228
-Did you get it?
-Oh I did,
I was covering up the light,

703
00:58:13,402 --> 00:58:15,448
I was shooting the whole time.

704
00:58:15,622 --> 00:58:18,799
He is our antagonist.
I think he was wonderful.

705
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:23,456
He looked intense and angry,
and then he come to you,
people are going to love it!

706
00:58:25,676 --> 00:58:27,808
Do you mind if I have
a drink too?
My throat hurts.

707
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:30,681
Drink up.

708
00:58:32,247 --> 00:58:33,292
[gags]

709
00:58:34,598 --> 00:58:36,425
Can I also?

710
00:58:39,037 --> 00:58:40,038
-Thank you.
-[hums]

711
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:42,040
[guzzles]

712
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:49,787
I believe he is thirsty.

713
00:58:55,009 --> 00:58:57,925
-Rocco ruined everything.
-Everything is alright.

714
00:58:58,665 --> 00:59:01,712
-No he took the money I wanted
to give you.
-My reward has always

715
00:59:01,886 --> 00:59:02,887
been your kiss.

716
00:59:04,453 --> 00:59:05,542
How about a blow job?

717
00:59:07,326 --> 00:59:10,808
We can't shoot real sex,
that would be porno.

718
00:59:12,026 --> 00:59:14,246
And I don't want to be like
all of your other men.

719
00:59:17,205 --> 00:59:19,904
Trust me,
you're nothing like
my other men.

720
00:59:20,687 --> 00:59:23,342
Well then,
let's get it going.

721
00:59:23,821 --> 00:59:25,387
It is getting late,
and I am tired.

722
00:59:26,998 --> 00:59:28,521
-I can't do it.
-Do what?

723
00:59:29,043 --> 00:59:30,088
Hang myself.

724
00:59:32,351 --> 00:59:36,703
Turn it on, turn it on.
I want you to say that again,
to the camera.

725
00:59:38,836 --> 00:59:42,579
-I can't hang myself.
-No no no, don't say it
into the camera,

726
00:59:42,753 --> 00:59:45,407
say it to him.
I'm directing this thing,
thank you.

727
00:59:46,626 --> 00:59:49,760
-I can't hang myself.
-Now we can get married.

728
00:59:49,977 --> 00:59:52,240
-No we can't.
-Why not?

729
00:59:52,632 --> 00:59:54,460
Because I still want to die.

730
00:59:55,504 --> 00:59:57,724
I just don't want
to hang myself.

731
00:59:59,944 --> 01:00:01,467
There's got to be a better way.

732
01:00:03,077 --> 01:00:08,779
What better way?
Hanging is so cinematic.
It's always worked

733
01:00:08,953 --> 01:00:11,303
-for Clint Eastwood.
-I don't want to struggle.

734
01:00:12,217 --> 01:00:16,569
I just,
I want to go peacefully.
Like Juliet.

735
01:00:22,270 --> 01:00:25,665
Cut, cut, cut.
Look Juliet did not
go peacefully.

736
01:00:26,013 --> 01:00:28,189
She stabbed herself
with Romeo's dagger.

737
01:00:33,542 --> 01:00:38,635
I have an idea.
It's not lewd,
it's very Romeo and Juliet.

738
01:00:41,725 --> 01:00:43,944
-I cannot do it.
-Do what?

739
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:47,818
-I cannot kill you.
-[sighs]

740
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:51,865
I am sorry.
I care about you.

741
01:00:53,127 --> 01:00:56,957
You don't even know me.
If you care about me,
you'll help me.

742
01:00:58,306 --> 01:01:00,613
Come on,
our movie is over.

743
01:01:01,788 --> 01:01:05,618
Great the movie is over,
we were so close,
we were so close to hanging you.

744
01:01:11,363 --> 01:01:12,364
[news show music]

745
01:01:17,978 --> 01:01:21,590
YouTube has produced a lot
of bizarre would be celebrities,
in recent years.

746
01:01:21,765 --> 01:01:26,291
In recent years,
but perhaps none as bizarre,
as two unidentified men,

747
01:01:26,465 --> 01:01:30,512
and one woman,
who might or might not be
exploiting urban legend.

748
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:32,384
By producing a snuff film.

749
01:01:33,124 --> 01:01:36,693
-We're famous.
-Hey turn that up.

750
01:01:39,391 --> 01:01:43,438
Taken at face value,
the YouTube video
which has already gone viral,

751
01:01:43,612 --> 01:01:48,574
and generated four million hits.
Tells the story
of a plump Rastafarian,

752
01:01:48,748 --> 01:01:53,710
a dim-witted Caucasian,
and an exotic woman,
who wants to hang herself.

753
01:01:56,277 --> 01:02:00,891
-What is a snuff film?
-We're not making a snuff film.
It's an offbeat romantic comedy,

754
01:02:01,065 --> 01:02:02,327
where the heroine dies
at the end.

755
01:02:04,024 --> 01:02:07,506
We need to talk to candy,
figure out what her idea was
for the new end of the movie.

756
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:08,899
Come on,
we have to go!

757
01:02:11,031 --> 01:02:14,078
Let me finish my beer,
it is very expensive.

758
01:02:24,610 --> 01:02:28,527
These maniacs,
they're out of control.

759
01:02:30,094 --> 01:02:35,577
And we have reason to believe,
they are in the process,
of making a snuff film.

760
01:02:36,143 --> 01:02:39,277
And we could be looking at
a Patty Hearst type situation.

761
01:02:39,451 --> 01:02:43,847
Where the victim,
has sided with her abductors,
and might be willing

762
01:02:44,021 --> 01:02:45,152
to be snuffed.

763
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:52,986
Now make no mistake,
I will not let that happen
on my watch.

764
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:56,773
Especially with a black guy,
and that crazy Caucasian.

765
01:02:57,077 --> 01:03:01,778
I want these deadbeats found,
and I want them back
where they belong!

766
01:03:02,909 --> 01:03:04,781
Let's get out there,
and get to work!

767
01:03:05,303 --> 01:03:07,740
-[officers]Yes sir!
-Yes sir is right.

768
01:03:07,914 --> 01:03:11,265
So unlimited overtime,
is not an issue on this one?

769
01:03:11,439 --> 01:03:14,660
Hooper, how about you go
walk your dog right now, OK?

770
01:03:17,402 --> 01:03:20,753
-Sleeping pills.
-It's so much less cinematic.

771
01:03:21,493 --> 01:03:25,802
-As the director,
I have to object.
-It's my death scene.

772
01:03:27,978 --> 01:03:31,372
Alright, but it would be
so much more exciting,
if there were

773
01:03:31,546 --> 01:03:34,506
a more violent ending.
Would you consider shooting
yourself in the head?

774
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:35,899
[splatter noises]
In the stomach?

775
01:03:36,073 --> 01:03:38,771
-[splatter noises]
-Absolutely not.

776
01:03:42,514 --> 01:03:43,950
No, sleeping pills it is.

777
01:03:46,518 --> 01:03:50,304
But, let's not hurry.
We can wait until tomorrow.

778
01:03:52,872 --> 01:03:55,353
And lets post another
instalment to YouTube.

779
01:03:57,442 --> 01:03:58,835
First good idea
you've had all day.

780
01:04:18,376 --> 01:04:22,989
-Hello how can I help you?
-I would like to buy some
sleeping pills.

781
01:04:23,163 --> 01:04:25,296
-Do you have a prescription?
-No.

782
01:04:26,819 --> 01:04:29,430
I'm sorry there's nothing
I could really do,
you need to go see your doctor.

783
01:04:29,604 --> 01:04:32,825
-I do not have a doctor.
-You don't have a doctor?

784
01:04:35,262 --> 01:04:37,743
-I mean everybody has
to have a doctor.
-I am healthy.

785
01:04:37,917 --> 01:04:40,528
Yeah but here you are,
trying to get
some sleeping pills.

786
01:04:42,530 --> 01:04:46,186
I work during the night,
and I need to sleep
during the day.

787
01:04:46,839 --> 01:04:49,276
I desire a deep sleep.

788
01:04:50,843 --> 01:04:54,934
-Well how do you define,
"deep sleep"?
-I do not wake up.

789
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:58,720
Boy I tell you what,
I know exactly
what you're saying.

790
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:01,941
Because this whole thing where
you work at night,
and then you got to sleep

791
01:05:02,115 --> 01:05:04,813
during the day,
it's your whole circadian rhythm
it just gets

792
01:05:04,988 --> 01:05:09,601
-totally out of whack.
-I need to go to sleep,
and be assured that I do not

793
01:05:09,775 --> 01:05:11,908
-wake up.
-[hums]

794
01:05:14,258 --> 01:05:17,391
I am sure that there
is something you can do,
to help me.

795
01:05:19,089 --> 01:05:24,572
-Without a prescription?
-I will not tell anyone.
I promise.

796
01:05:28,881 --> 01:05:29,969
What's with the camera?

797
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:36,976
-We are shooting a documentary.
-Really?
What's it about?

798
01:05:37,150 --> 01:05:41,546
It is about an African,
who comes to America,
to buy sleeping pills.

799
01:05:42,503 --> 01:05:45,245
And you came here?
Am I going to be in it?

800
01:05:45,419 --> 01:05:48,553
You're starring in it right now.
Look into the camera.

801
01:05:50,163 --> 01:05:53,775
Wow I feel good about this.
I mean I have heard
about this stuff

802
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:55,516
like on Craigslist
and stuff, and...

803
01:06:00,086 --> 01:06:03,785
-Yes I will take
the pills to go.
-OK uhm.

804
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:09,748
-This is the closing scene.
-OK there's that,
and I'd also get some Abilify.

805
01:06:12,446 --> 01:06:13,926
That's an anti-psychotic drug.

01:06:24,850 --> 01:06:27,766
the question remains,
what is going on here?

809
01:06:28,375 --> 01:06:32,989
To help answer that question,
we have an expert opinion
from Dr. Conover Brown.

810
01:06:33,163 --> 01:06:35,687
With the film history
department at UCLA.

811
01:06:36,340 --> 01:06:40,822
Dr. Brown, what can you
tell us about this,
media phenomenon?

812
01:06:41,084 --> 01:06:45,044
Technically, it is not
a so-called "snuff film,"
because as I understand it,

813
01:06:45,218 --> 01:06:48,004
the woman in question,
is planning to commit suicide.

814
01:06:48,656 --> 01:06:53,270
However, my concern is that
she is being wilfully assisted
by her "co-star",

815
01:06:53,487 --> 01:06:56,882
and by her "director"
of this alleged "movie."

816
01:06:57,796 --> 01:07:00,929
Whatever this is,
even if it turns out to be
a joke,

817
01:07:01,887 --> 01:07:04,324
it is,
definitely appalling.

818
01:07:05,282 --> 01:07:08,807
If it's the woman
who wants to die,
then why is it her "co-star"

819
01:07:08,981 --> 01:07:10,156
that's being hanged?

820
01:07:11,244 --> 01:07:16,119
He is apparently
an escaped mental patient,
so frankly we have no way

821
01:07:16,293 --> 01:07:18,817
-of knowing what's going on
with him.
-Wow.

822
01:07:19,122 --> 01:07:23,474
Well, this much we do know.
Whether this "movie"
is real or not,

823
01:07:23,865 --> 01:07:26,520
these folks are
definitely getting
their 15 minutes of fame.

824
01:07:26,694 --> 01:07:29,480
And what does that say,
about American culture?

825
01:07:33,005 --> 01:07:34,659
This is Candy's big death scene.

826
01:07:35,486 --> 01:07:37,879
After having second thoughts
about hanging herself,

827
01:07:38,706 --> 01:07:41,753
she has decided to use,
sleeping pills.

828
01:07:43,755 --> 01:07:45,148
It is a tragic story.

01:20:27,431 --> 01:20:29,737
-He needs to be picked up.
-[laughing]

973
01:20:32,740 --> 01:20:35,439
-After you.
-Stupid jerk face.

974
01:20:42,750 --> 01:20:44,317
I felt like Sugar Ray.

975
01:20:46,015 --> 01:20:47,016
[kiss]

976
01:20:53,022 --> 01:20:55,589
You made good on your promise.
You saved me.

977
01:20:56,634 --> 01:20:57,809
You're my hero.

978
01:21:00,072 --> 01:21:03,771
You are no longer Candy,
you are now Emily.

979
01:21:04,555 --> 01:21:05,599
Once again.

980
01:21:07,906 --> 01:21:10,866
That may take some
getting used to,
but yes.

981
01:21:13,825 --> 01:21:14,870
[kissing]

982
01:21:25,010 --> 01:21:28,274
We have to celebrate!
Let's go!
Go!

983
01:21:37,588 --> 01:21:38,502
[bowling pins fall]

984
01:21:38,676 --> 01:21:39,720
Yeah!

985
01:21:42,549 --> 01:21:45,204
Put your hands up!
And drop the ball!

986
01:21:45,683 --> 01:21:48,991
Drop the ball!
Put the ball down now!

987
01:21:49,382 --> 01:21:51,384
Drop the ball now!

988
01:21:55,693 --> 01:21:57,782
-You must be the victim.
-Victim?

989
01:21:57,956 --> 01:22:00,785
-For the Snuff film.
-I don't know what
you're talking about,

990
01:22:01,133 --> 01:22:04,963
-I'm Juliet.
-Sure you are.
Are you off your meds too?

991
01:22:06,008 --> 01:22:09,054
Adventure's over,
time for you boys to go home.

992
01:22:14,103 --> 01:22:16,105
Aren't you going to arrest me?

993
01:22:16,757 --> 01:22:19,499
They're not being arrested,
they're being escorted,
back to where they belong.

994
01:22:20,326 --> 01:22:21,327
Says who?

995
01:22:23,242 --> 01:22:25,941
Dr. Douglas Tucker,
County Hospital.

996
01:22:35,863 --> 01:22:36,908
[inaudible audio]

997
01:22:48,964 --> 01:22:49,965
[news show music]

998
01:22:52,271 --> 01:22:56,275
This just in,
the two escaped mental patients,
from the popular Snuff film,

999
01:22:56,449 --> 01:22:58,756
were arrested this evening.

1000
01:22:58,930 --> 01:23:03,717
Fumnanya's real name,
is Keith Johnson,
and he's from Detroit.

1001
01:23:04,544 --> 01:23:09,419
Apparently he lost his wife,
a young aspiring actress,
to breast cancer.

1002
01:23:09,593 --> 01:23:12,509
The film was supposedly
a tribute to her.

1003
01:23:29,091 --> 01:23:30,179
Hi Keith.

1004
01:23:34,879 --> 01:23:35,967
Candy.

1005
01:23:37,882 --> 01:23:40,580
My woman,
I love you.

1006
01:23:42,104 --> 01:23:43,540
I'm Fumnanya.

1007
01:23:47,283 --> 01:23:48,458
How are you doing?

1008
01:23:50,851 --> 01:23:52,201
Not so well.

1009
01:23:54,855 --> 01:23:56,118
Not for long.

1010
01:24:01,297 --> 01:24:05,562
Atlanta is on fire Rhett,
ride me home to Tara.

1011
01:24:07,781 --> 01:24:11,568
You make sure to tell him,
I kept a copy.
And if doesn't want end up

1012
01:24:11,742 --> 01:24:16,051
a "YouTube celebrity," too,
he better come to his senses
and make the right decision.

1013
01:24:18,488 --> 01:24:19,532
OK.

1014
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:23,145
-OK.
-OK.

1015
01:24:29,934 --> 01:24:30,978
[kiss]

1016
01:24:50,172 --> 01:24:51,173
[laughing]

1017
01:24:55,002 --> 01:24:56,700
Ride me home to Tara!

1018
01:24:57,266 --> 01:24:58,267
[moaning]

1019
01:25:08,233 --> 01:25:13,586
-What do you want?
-Unconditional freedom.
In writing.

1020
01:25:19,418 --> 01:25:21,072
Then no one will ever see this.

1021
01:25:32,953 --> 01:25:34,433
Mr. Bones what do you think?

1022
01:25:37,958 --> 01:25:40,961
-I think they'll love it.
-It's not as long
as the original

1023
01:25:41,136 --> 01:25:43,442
"Gone with the Wind",
but still.
I think it brings something

1024
01:25:43,616 --> 01:25:49,013
-new to it.
-Yes, I think it brings
something really special.

1025
01:25:49,666 --> 01:25:52,495
True love.
There is a place.

1026
01:26:12,428 --> 01:26:13,429
Perfect.

1027
01:26:28,922 --> 01:26:31,229
I have taken a liking,
to the fire water.

1028
01:26:35,059 --> 01:26:39,237
We have a check,
for $86,435.

1029
01:26:39,411 --> 01:26:40,412
[celebrating]

1030
01:26:46,288 --> 01:26:47,637
Here's to our new lives!

1031
01:26:51,467 --> 01:26:52,772
I'm getting a private jet.

1032
01:26:53,904 --> 01:26:56,820
My future is so bright,
I shall continue to wear shades.

1033
01:26:58,300 --> 01:27:00,345
-Goddammit!
-How about a drink?

1034
01:27:00,519 --> 01:27:01,520
Yeah!

1035
01:27:06,917 --> 01:27:08,179
[laughing]

1036
01:27:08,658 --> 01:27:12,531
Atlanta is on fire,
Ride me home to Tara!

1037
01:27:15,708 --> 01:27:18,102
-Oh man that's crazy.
-That's hilarious.

1038
01:27:21,540 --> 01:27:24,239
Baby I didn't do it,
would you stop throwing
things at me?

1039
01:27:25,022 --> 01:27:27,894
Look what the hell
am I going to do?
Where am I going to go?

1040
01:27:32,943 --> 01:27:36,207
Did these events actually happen
as Maramount,
and YouTube,

1041
01:27:36,381 --> 01:27:40,385
the two former lunatics,
and the ex hooker claim?
Or was the whole thing

1042
01:27:40,559 --> 01:27:43,519
an elaborate ruse,
cooked up by a clever,
Hollywood publicist?

1043
01:27:43,910 --> 01:27:48,480
We may never know.
But one thing is for sure,
this tale has had

1044
01:27:48,654 --> 01:27:53,268
a very happy ending,
for almost all concerned.
And that's what really matters

1045
01:27:53,442 --> 01:27:55,879
in the grand tradition
of Hollywood, right?

1046
01:28:03,408 --> 01:28:07,369
Hello Brad?
This is Penny Marshall,
I was just watching

1047
01:28:07,543 --> 01:28:11,982
on one of these news channels,
snippets of this
YouTube snuff film.

1048
01:28:13,026 --> 01:28:14,811
I think it's big.

1049
01:28:17,292 --> 01:28:19,294
They say you're
the next big thing.

1050
01:28:20,338 --> 01:28:22,079
I read about you in Variety.

1051
01:28:23,515 --> 01:28:26,605
Well if you don't
mind me asking,
I have a script here for you.

1052
01:28:27,214 --> 01:28:30,392
It's about
the Mexican Revolution,
are you interested?

1053
01:28:33,873 --> 01:28:34,874
