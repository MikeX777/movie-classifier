1
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,120
Hello, Xihe.

2
00:00:29,895 --> 00:00:31,855
Now, let’s begin our class.

3
00:00:32,263 --> 00:00:33,663
Please open your textbook.

4
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:41,583
Xihe.

5
00:00:42,047 --> 00:00:43,367
Please open your textbook.

6
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:52,759
Xihe!

7
00:00:54,127 --> 00:00:56,367
Open your textbook. We are in class!

8
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:05,799
Xihe!

9
00:01:11,735 --> 00:01:12,655
Xihe!

10
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,160
Xihe.

11
00:02:14,288 --> 00:02:15,608
Let’s go. Time for school.

12
00:02:22,487 --> 00:02:24,127
Your subway pass… Don’t lose it again.

13
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,520
Read it.

14
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,680
My name is Li Xihe.

15
00:02:28,854 --> 00:02:30,974
Good boy. Put on your schoolbag.

16
00:02:35,432 --> 00:02:36,272
We’re leaving.

17
00:02:36,559 --> 00:02:37,599
Wait!

18
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:40,119
Here’s his thermos.

19
00:02:41,399 --> 00:02:42,239
All set!

20
00:02:42,931 --> 00:02:43,931
Say goodbye to your dad.

21
00:02:43,957 --> 00:02:45,117
Goodbye, dad.

22
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,280
Goodbye, bye.

23
00:02:47,839 --> 00:02:48,919
Let’s go.

24
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:04,767
Tian Lin!

25
00:03:06,547 --> 00:03:07,707
You forgot the candies.

26
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,270
They are very important. 
How could you forget them?

27
00:03:22,928 --> 00:03:23,888
Got it. Go back home.

28
00:03:24,312 --> 00:03:25,759
-See you.
-Okay.

29
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,710
Hey, buy some more 
if they’re not enough!

30
00:04:20,992 --> 00:04:21,832
Xihe.

31
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,440
Walk ahead of mum.

32
00:04:25,567 --> 00:04:27,167
Swipe the card yourself.

33
00:04:30,239 --> 00:04:31,159
Go.

34
00:04:34,326 --> 00:04:37,166
<i>The next station is Hongshuwan.</i>

35
00:04:37,565 --> 00:04:39,885
<i>The door on the left side 
will be used.</i>

36
00:04:40,111 --> 00:04:41,031
Read it.

37
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,590
Did you hear me? Read it.

38
00:04:46,807 --> 00:04:47,887
Are you reading it or not?

39
00:04:51,846 --> 00:04:52,926
Read it.

40
00:04:53,463 --> 00:04:55,000
Look at this. Read it!

41
00:04:55,239 --> 00:04:57,199
What’s this? Look closely.

42
00:04:57,379 --> 00:04:59,080
Don’t poke Lei Yiming with pencils.

43
00:04:59,106 --> 00:05:00,626
Okay, good.

44
00:05:00,744 --> 00:05:01,744
And this one?

45
00:05:02,744 --> 00:05:04,464
Don’t shout in the classroom.

46
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,680
Good.

47
00:05:07,183 --> 00:05:08,143
This one?

48
00:05:08,966 --> 00:05:10,046
Say it.

49
00:05:12,975 --> 00:05:13,975
Come on.

50
00:05:16,455 --> 00:05:17,415
Tell me.

51
00:05:18,983 --> 00:05:19,943
Tell me now.

52
00:05:20,326 --> 00:05:21,126
I’m waiting.

53
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:22,439
Say it now!

54
00:05:24,648 --> 00:05:25,822
Don’t pee in the…

55
00:05:25,848 --> 00:05:27,008
Out of my way…

56
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,800
Stop pushing.

57
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,560
<i>The next station is 
Windows of the World.</i>

58
00:05:43,975 --> 00:05:47,615
<i>It is a transfer station to 
Line No.1 Luobao.</i>

59
00:05:48,183 --> 00:05:50,703
<i>The door on the right side 
will be used.</i>

60
00:05:50,799 --> 00:05:54,839
<i>Please mind the gap 
between the train and the platform.</i>

61
00:07:09,976 --> 00:07:11,016
Hi, auntie.

62
00:07:12,775 --> 00:07:14,535
How come it’s you sending 
Zixiang again?

63
00:07:15,046 --> 00:07:16,326
Our nanny quitted.

64
00:07:16,805 --> 00:07:18,245
How’s Xihe doing?

65
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:20,271
He’s been acting up too.

66
00:07:20,552 --> 00:07:26,352
Hey! Zixiang! Zixiang! Zixiang!

67
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:59,471
Hi, Xihe brought candies 
for all of you.

68
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,840
All sit down and 
I’ll give you the candies.

69
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,359
Here, have some candies. 
Please be nice to Xihe.

70
00:08:05,442 --> 00:08:08,202
Be nice to Xihe. Thank you. 
I thank you all.

71
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,493
Please be nice to Xihe.

72
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:11,199
Auntie, I want a lollipop.

73
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:13,765
Please be nice to Xihe. 
Please be nice to him.

74
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:15,359
Thank you. Thank you. Thank  you all.

75
00:08:15,392 --> 00:08:16,800
Dingding, this is for you.

76
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:18,639
Hello, auntie. Thank you.

77
00:08:18,679 --> 00:08:21,040
Our teacher told us to help Xihe.

78
00:08:21,086 --> 00:08:23,166
Good girl. Have another piece.

79
00:08:23,239 --> 00:08:24,359
Thank you.

80
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:27,799
If someone picks on Xihe,
I’ll beat him up.

81
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,040
Such a good kid!

82
00:08:29,119 --> 00:08:30,639
Right, last time…

83
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,559
Xihe poked you with a pencil. 
Still hurt?

84
00:08:32,614 --> 00:08:33,600
Nope.

85
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,520
I’m really sorry for what he did.

86
00:08:36,239 --> 00:08:38,280
Now, who hasn’t got any candies?

87
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,880
Okay, okay. Here you are.

88
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,921
No lollipops.

89
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,400
Next time I’ll bring 
some lollipops, okay?

90
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,000
Who hasn’t got any? Here you go.

91
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,040
-Auntie.
-Auntie.

92
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:56,119
A batch of children’s books…

93
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:00,039
are divided between two classes
by the ratio of 6:8.

94
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:03,759
How many books does each class get?

95
00:09:03,785 --> 00:09:04,585
Very good.

96
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:06,851
Now please solve the problem 
on your own.

97
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,400
Then discuss the answer 
with the one sitting next to you.

98
00:09:09,479 --> 00:09:10,959
Ready, begin.

99
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,510
Come in, please.

100
00:09:25,479 --> 00:09:28,359
Mrs. Li, you don’t need 
to bring candies next time.

101
00:09:28,422 --> 00:09:30,302
As classmates, 
they ought to help Xihe.

102
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,801
It’s nothing, really.

103
00:09:31,832 --> 00:09:33,072
It’s just my way of thanking them.

104
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:34,370
Please have a seat.

105
00:09:34,566 --> 00:09:37,406
Sorry for all the trouble 
Xihe caused in class.

106
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,119
Don’t mention it.

107
00:09:40,174 --> 00:09:42,054
I quite like Xihe, actually.

108
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,423
Mrs. Li…

109
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:51,439
Xihe’s been acting up 
in class recently.

110
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,400
He ran around in class sometimes.

111
00:09:54,223 --> 00:09:56,583
Some teachers have complained to me
about this.

112
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,600
Is that so…

113
00:10:00,072 --> 00:10:02,632
I’m really sorry for the trouble.

114
00:10:02,927 --> 00:10:04,727
I’m his mother… I know what he’s like.

115
00:10:06,479 --> 00:10:07,919
The thing is…

116
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,000
some parents have complained 
to the principal.

117
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,400
What? What did the principal say?

118
00:10:13,726 --> 00:10:15,486
Given the situation…

119
00:10:15,727 --> 00:10:18,247
the school decided to observe him 
some more.

120
00:10:20,239 --> 00:10:23,039
Ms. Zhao, you know 
how hard it was to get Xihe in.

121
00:10:23,102 --> 00:10:25,502
Please don’t kick him out. 
I’m begging you.

122
00:10:26,008 --> 00:10:28,048
Mrs. Li, I understand you completely.

123
00:10:28,311 --> 00:10:31,800
We agreed to admit Xihe
because we truly care about him.

124
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:34,071
But now there are some problems.

125
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,760
Let’s work together to solve them.

126
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:38,871
Okay. Okay.

127
00:10:39,694 --> 00:10:40,734
Thank you.

128
00:10:46,222 --> 00:10:47,462
Class dismissed!

129
00:10:49,133 --> 00:10:52,213
Goodbye, sir!

130
00:10:52,239 --> 00:10:53,400
Goodbye, class.

131
00:10:53,463 --> 00:10:56,903
Hey, Zixiang! Stop! Come back!

132
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:04,744
Stop!

133
00:11:09,494 --> 00:11:12,573
Stop! Stop!

134
00:11:12,646 --> 00:11:15,366
Hurry! Go and get him!

135
00:11:39,978 --> 00:11:41,218
I’m warning you!

136
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:44,679
Don’t let me catch you playing with
your member again in class!

137
00:11:45,479 --> 00:11:46,519
Pervert!

138
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,340
Imbecile!

139
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,080
Stupid moron!

140
00:11:51,265 --> 00:11:52,305
Screw you!

141
00:12:12,024 --> 00:12:13,144
Here’s your number.

142
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,640
-Please wait over there. 
-Okay, thank you.

143
00:12:23,575 --> 00:12:26,815
Tian, how’s your boy doing at school?

144
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,960
He’s doing fine.

145
00:12:29,366 --> 00:12:31,126
Just tell me if you need any help.

146
00:12:31,711 --> 00:12:32,551
Thanks.

147
00:13:07,126 --> 00:13:08,206
Dinner’s ready.

148
00:13:16,206 --> 00:13:17,486
Xihe, let’s have dinner.

149
00:13:27,071 --> 00:13:28,431
Come, sit down.

150
00:13:39,495 --> 00:13:40,735
Have some vegetables.

151
00:13:45,863 --> 00:13:46,783
Grandma!

152
00:13:48,502 --> 00:13:49,782
Grandma! I’m washing!

153
00:13:53,551 --> 00:13:54,751
Grandma!

154
00:13:59,846 --> 00:14:00,886
Stop it!

155
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,920
Behave!

156
00:14:34,886 --> 00:14:36,807
Xihe. See, no map.

157
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:37,839
Let’s go.

158
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:44,230
Come on. Let’s go. Forget the map.

159
00:14:54,599 --> 00:14:55,519
Hurry.

160
00:14:56,974 --> 00:14:58,080
Hurry up!

161
00:15:03,487 --> 00:15:04,447
Why stop?

162
00:15:06,483 --> 00:15:08,640
See. Go, go, go.
Be brave. Let’s go.

163
00:15:10,063 --> 00:15:12,503
Hey you, stop! Come back! Get back!

164
00:15:12,696 --> 00:15:13,816
Get back!

165
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,760
What were you thinking?

166
00:16:11,823 --> 00:16:14,663
Who are you? What are you doing here?

167
00:16:15,646 --> 00:16:18,126
We’re in the middle of a class. 
Get out.

168
00:16:19,694 --> 00:16:20,694
Out!

169
00:16:22,822 --> 00:16:24,062
Get out of here.

170
00:16:46,573 --> 00:16:47,934
Hey, Ms. Li.

171
00:16:48,028 --> 00:16:49,148
Do you know where Li Xihe is?

172
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,440
I haven’t seen him
since the art class.

173
00:16:50,472 --> 00:16:53,032
Eh? But I took him to the stairway.

174
00:16:53,801 --> 00:16:55,679
Where did he go?
Let’s split up and look for him!

175
00:16:55,705 --> 00:16:56,705
Okay.

176
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,960
Lin, time for lunch.

177
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:48,679
You go ahead.

178
00:17:48,719 --> 00:17:49,999
Okay, see you later.

179
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,960
Xihe! You’re here!

180
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,520
Our teachers are looking for you 
everywhere!

181
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,317
-Let’s get back to the classroom.
-Hurry up!

182
00:18:24,343 --> 00:18:25,823
-Come on!
-Come on!

183
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,279
Go, go! Get moving!

184
00:18:27,378 --> 00:18:30,098
You’ve missed two classes!

185
00:18:30,504 --> 00:18:33,224
We’ll study math 
instead of Chinese today.

186
00:18:33,352 --> 00:18:35,000
Take out your math textbooks.

187
00:18:36,975 --> 00:18:38,775
And turn to page 24.

188
00:18:40,334 --> 00:18:42,654
We’re studying Chapter Three.

189
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,870
Addition and subtraction.

190
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,160
Look, what’s he doing?

191
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:50,479
Who knows.

192
00:18:56,255 --> 00:18:57,615
Chinese.

193
00:18:58,199 --> 00:19:00,839
Xihe, we changed Chinese 
to math today.

194
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,119
Hurry back to your seat.

195
00:19:02,206 --> 00:19:03,686
-Lei Yiming. 
-Yes.

196
00:19:03,823 --> 00:19:05,863
Come and help Xihe back to his seat.

197
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,440
Go with him.

198
00:19:07,518 --> 00:19:12,478
Chinese, Chinese, Chinese, Chinese.

199
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:16,879
Chinese.

200
00:19:20,364 --> 00:19:24,404
Chinese, Chinese, Chinese, 
Chinese, Chinese…

201
00:19:24,457 --> 00:19:25,737
-Li Xihe!
- Chinese…

202
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:26,719
Chinese…

203
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,720
Stop it! We’re studying math now!

204
00:19:29,784 --> 00:19:30,904
Li Xihe, what are you doing?!

205
00:19:30,959 --> 00:19:32,279
Get off me!

206
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,959
Be quiet! Stop shouting!

207
00:19:35,959 --> 00:19:39,280
Chinese, Chinese, Chinese, Chinese…

208
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,160
Here, Xihe. This is yours.

209
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,360
-He’s crazy! Grab him now!
- Chinese!

210
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,517
What are you doing?!

211
00:19:46,543 --> 00:19:48,463
Chinese, Chinese, Chinese, Chinese…

212
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:49,800
Where did he bite you?

213
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,040
-Li Xihe! Stop it now!
-Chinese,  Chinese, Chinese!

214
00:19:52,631 --> 00:19:53,991
-Stop yelling. All sit down.
-Chinese,  Chinese, Chinese!

215
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,470
-Xihe, you stop right now! Be quiet!
-Chinese,  Chinese, Chinese!

216
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:57,840
Enough of this!
-Chinese,  Chinese, Chinese!

217
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,640
-Be quiet, everyone!
-Chinese,  Chinese, Chinese!

218
00:19:59,721 --> 00:20:01,881
-All get back to the seats.
-Chinese,  Chinese, Chinese!

219
00:20:01,959 --> 00:20:03,510
-She’s bleeding!
-Chinese,  Chinese, Chinese!

220
00:20:03,566 --> 00:20:06,166
-Xihe! Stop it now!
-Chinese,  Chinese, Chinese!

221
00:20:20,884 --> 00:20:22,284
Wait, your change!

222
00:20:23,616 --> 00:20:25,936
Hey, miss! Where are you… Hey!

223
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,120
You are Dingding’s mother?

224
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,520
I’m so sorry!

225
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,720
Let me see where he bit you.

226
00:20:36,847 --> 00:20:38,287
Don’t touch her!

227
00:20:38,768 --> 00:20:41,168
Sorry! I’m really sorry!

228
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:43,159
You knew what your son is like.

229
00:20:43,199 --> 00:20:44,679
You shouldn’t have sent him to school!

230
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,960
It was an accident, really.

231
00:20:47,128 --> 00:20:48,928
Xihe is usually well-behaved.

232
00:20:48,992 --> 00:20:49,952
Well-behaved?

233
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,520
Like when he poked his classmate 
with a pencil?

234
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,000
Or when he peed in the hallway?

235
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,640
Or screamed and shouted in 
the middle of a class?

236
00:20:56,984 --> 00:21:00,304
Mrs., my son is slightly autistic.

237
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,680
Sometimes he can’t control 
his emotions.

238
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,360
So what?

239
00:21:04,386 --> 00:21:06,186
Is that an excuse for his misbehavior?

240
00:21:06,512 --> 00:21:08,192
With his conditions…

241
00:21:09,439 --> 00:21:11,599
you shouldn’t have sent him here 
in the first place!

242
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:18,599
Xihe, come here!

243
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,400
Say sorry to Dingding.

244
00:21:22,876 --> 00:21:24,596
Say you’re sorry!

245
00:21:25,567 --> 00:21:26,567
Say it!

246
00:21:28,742 --> 00:21:29,542
Say it!

247
00:21:30,486 --> 00:21:31,446
Say it!

248
00:21:32,864 --> 00:21:33,904
Mr. Principal…

249
00:21:34,815 --> 00:21:37,975
Why do you admit kids 
with mental problems here?

250
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:43,079
Dingding, let’s go!

251
00:21:43,309 --> 00:21:44,189
Mrs. ...

252
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:47,159
Mrs.Wu!

253
00:22:02,959 --> 00:22:04,599
Now, take him back home to rest.

254
00:22:06,407 --> 00:22:07,527
We’ll talk about this later.

255
00:22:07,553 --> 00:22:08,673
Okay.

256
00:22:09,711 --> 00:22:13,911
Please, don’t kick him out. 
I’m begging you.

257
00:22:20,983 --> 00:22:22,823
It took us much to send you 
to study here.

258
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,520
Now with the bite, 
they’ll probably kick you out.

259
00:22:25,687 --> 00:22:26,640
You know that?

260
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,120
Xihe…

261
00:22:32,728 --> 00:22:33,648
Remember.

262
00:22:33,927 --> 00:22:35,247
No biting at school.

263
00:22:36,485 --> 00:22:38,320
No biting and you can go to school!

264
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,720
Let’s go.

265
00:22:47,463 --> 00:22:50,983
Subway! Subway!

266
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,920
-Let’s go. 
-Take the subway!

267
00:22:52,946 --> 00:22:55,226
This entrance’s closed. 
Let’s go to the other side.

268
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,800
Xihe! Let’s go!

269
00:22:58,431 --> 00:23:00,551
-Are you going or not?
-Take the subway.

270
00:23:01,286 --> 00:23:03,926
Let go of the railing! Let’s go!

271
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:06,800
Xihe, be quiet.

272
00:23:06,942 --> 00:23:08,582
-Stop it! 
-Take the subway.

273
00:23:25,918 --> 00:23:27,998
Next time when he’s about 
to have a fit…

274
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:30,199
Try to distract him immediately.

275
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,920
That seems to work.

276
00:23:34,614 --> 00:23:35,614
Zixiang's grandma.

277
00:23:36,006 --> 00:23:39,446
I’ve heard that you enjoy 
good relations with the school.

278
00:23:40,174 --> 00:23:42,974
Hmm, the principal 
was my husband’s student.

279
00:23:43,439 --> 00:23:45,959
Could you put in a good word 
for my son?

280
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:48,519
I’m sorry.

281
00:23:48,752 --> 00:23:50,632
It’s hard enough with Zixiang.

282
00:23:55,383 --> 00:23:58,743
Today I saw some pupils 
bullying Zixiang.

283
00:23:59,206 --> 00:24:00,406
Do you know about this?

284
00:24:01,343 --> 00:24:02,143
I do.

285
00:24:03,502 --> 00:24:05,302
Those bruises on his face 
are clear enough.

286
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,120
It’s normal for him.

287
00:24:07,959 --> 00:24:09,519
He’s in puberty now.

288
00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:11,375
I see.

289
00:24:13,023 --> 00:24:16,823
Xihe is lucky to be raised 
by his parents.

290
00:24:17,134 --> 00:24:20,640
Poor Zixiang has nobody but me, 
his old grandma.

291
00:24:31,131 --> 00:24:34,091
<i>The next station is Houhai.</i>

292
00:24:34,147 --> 00:24:36,627
<i>The door on the left side 
will be used.</i>

293
00:24:37,086 --> 00:24:41,446
<i>Please mind the gap between 
the train and the platform.</i>

294
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,200
If it were up to me,

295
00:25:10,374 --> 00:25:12,214
I’d have him go to 
a special education school.

296
00:25:12,818 --> 00:25:13,978
It would be easier.

297
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:16,879
No way. We took so much trouble 
to get him in.

298
00:25:18,239 --> 00:25:19,679
I know you put a lot of effort.

299
00:25:19,752 --> 00:25:21,592
But he’s all alone in school…

300
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:23,743
I’ll accompany him 
studying there if it helps!

301
00:25:25,479 --> 00:25:26,399
What?

302
00:25:26,822 --> 00:25:28,040
Are you serious?

303
00:25:28,453 --> 00:25:30,933
You went to the kindergarten with him.

304
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:32,239
Now again?

305
00:25:32,367 --> 00:25:33,807
So? We’ve made it, haven’t we?

306
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,600
But we made it with a cost.

307
00:25:43,767 --> 00:25:46,007
You left a splendid job 
three years ago.

308
00:25:46,191 --> 00:25:47,431
I’m talking about Xihe with you.

309
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,920
Nothing to do with my job.

310
00:25:49,439 --> 00:25:51,199
Tell me, what should we do with him?

311
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:53,759
That’s easy.

312
00:25:54,983 --> 00:25:56,743
Let’s have another child.

313
00:25:57,086 --> 00:25:58,166
We’ve talked about this!

314
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,520
I only…

315
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:01,639
The food!

316
00:26:01,956 --> 00:26:02,996
It’s burnt.

317
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,560
-Wait, wait. 
-Don’t move.

318
00:27:39,728 --> 00:27:42,208
-Wait. 
-What are you doing?

319
00:27:56,719 --> 00:27:59,519
Dear, not with that, okay?

320
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,160
I’ve checked up on autism.

321
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,040
It’s not hereditary.

322
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:07,710
What are you talking about?

323
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,800
Besides, if we have 
another healthy child…

324
00:28:09,894 --> 00:28:11,694
he can take care of Xihe, right?

325
00:28:11,958 --> 00:28:12,878
I…

326
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,840
How dare you say that?

327
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,120
Wait.

328
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:29,559
Honey.

329
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,080
My name is Li Xihe.

330
00:29:01,103 --> 00:29:02,663
Xihe is going to school.

331
00:29:06,198 --> 00:29:08,958
Xihe, there’s no school today.

332
00:29:09,407 --> 00:29:11,727
Come, give me your schoolbag.

333
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,120
Take off the pass.

334
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:23,519
Here, read something.

335
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:06,080
Zixiang, time for breakfast.

336
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,600
Come.

337
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:14,239
Hurry.

338
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,030
Soy milk?

339
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:22,110
I’ll go and get you some.

340
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,600
I’m late!

341
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:44,520
Xihe, breakfast!

342
00:30:49,943 --> 00:30:50,903
Xihe!

343
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,520
Xihe!

344
00:32:04,998 --> 00:32:06,158
Sorry! Excuse me!

345
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:35,160
<i>Please wait in line and mind the gap 
between the train and the platform.</i>

346
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:39,399
<i>We’re arriving at Keyuan Station.</i>

347
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,960
Xihe!

348
00:32:48,294 --> 00:32:49,494
Xihe!

349
00:32:54,711 --> 00:32:57,080
Xihe!

350
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,120
-Xihe’s going to school.
-Xihe!

351
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,240
Xihe!

352
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,267
Why did you leave home alone?

353
00:33:27,293 --> 00:33:29,413
Huh? I was worried sick about you!

354
00:33:29,512 --> 00:33:30,512
What if you get lost?

355
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,479
You scared me..

356
00:33:31,479 --> 00:33:33,439
I’m spanking you!

357
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,800
-Will you do that again? Will you?
-Don’t beat him.

358
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,079
Don’t beat him. Calm down.

359
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,520
-Calm down. Calm.
-Don’t you dare leave home alone!

360
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:41,069
Listen to your mum. 
Don’t beat him. Calm down…

361
00:33:53,566 --> 00:33:55,206
Xihe’s going to school.

362
00:34:01,174 --> 00:34:03,094
Today Mum will be your teacher.

363
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,720
Here, take this.

364
00:34:19,959 --> 00:34:21,319
Have you learned this?

365
00:34:22,359 --> 00:34:23,360
What‘s this?

366
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,000
An elephant.

367
00:34:25,072 --> 00:34:26,272
Yes. An elephant.

368
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,000
What color is an elephant?

369
00:34:29,575 --> 00:34:31,015
What color is an elephant?

370
00:34:32,287 --> 00:34:33,247
It’s grey.

371
00:34:34,453 --> 00:34:36,574
-Grey. 
-Grey.

372
00:34:36,615 --> 00:34:37,615
Good.

373
00:34:38,366 --> 00:34:39,726
Okay. Let’s see the next one.

374
00:34:42,383 --> 00:34:43,343
Here.

375
00:34:47,815 --> 00:34:48,895
What’s this?

376
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:55,399
Clear sky and white clouds 
follow the rain.

377
00:34:55,399 --> 00:35:00,399
Clear sky and white clouds 
follow the rain.

378
00:35:00,479 --> 00:35:03,759
A rainbow spans the sky like a bridge.

379
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:08,480
A rainbow spans the sky like a bridge.

380
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,000
Very good. Who would like to try 
and read it out loud?

381
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:12,920
You will get a gold star.

382
00:35:13,879 --> 00:35:15,159
Hello, Ms. Zhao.

383
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,399
Hi, Mrs. Li.

384
00:35:16,399 --> 00:35:18,639
I brought Xihe to class.
Don’t worry about us.

385
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:20,399
We won’t disturb the class. 
I’ll stay with him.

386
00:35:20,449 --> 00:35:21,560
I’ll stay with him.

387
00:35:25,008 --> 00:35:28,528
But there’s no desk and chair for him.

388
00:35:31,919 --> 00:35:35,159
That’s okay. 
We can stand here listening.

389
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,480
Wait a second.

390
00:35:49,228 --> 00:35:50,828
I have a chair for you.

391
00:35:51,016 --> 00:35:52,896
But I'm sorry 
I can't get a desk for you.

392
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:54,359
Thank you, Ms. Zhao.

393
00:35:56,694 --> 00:35:58,454
Xihe, time for class.

394
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,280
Okay, class. 
Let’s read it one more time.

395
00:36:02,679 --> 00:36:05,319
Clear sky and white clouds
follow the rain.

396
00:36:05,439 --> 00:36:10,479
Clear sky and white clouds
follow the rain.

397
00:36:10,942 --> 00:36:14,062
A rainbow spans the sky like a bridge.

398
00:36:14,199 --> 00:36:18,759
A rainbow spans the sky like a bridge.

399
00:36:18,879 --> 00:36:21,439
Red, orange, yellow, green, 
blue, indigo and violet.

400
00:36:21,479 --> 00:36:26,359
Red, orange, yellow, green, 
blue, indigo and violet.

401
00:36:26,439 --> 00:36:29,119
The palette of colors 
is admired by all.

402
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:33,520
The palette of colors 
is admired by all.

403
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,440
Hi, Principal He.

404
00:36:37,655 --> 00:36:38,575
Come in.

405
00:36:38,879 --> 00:36:39,759
Come.

406
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,640
Xihe.

407
00:36:43,032 --> 00:36:46,352
Mr. Principal, I’m sorry.

408
00:36:47,439 --> 00:36:50,039
I won’t…won’t…

409
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:51,879
I won’t make…

410
00:36:52,375 --> 00:36:55,015
I won’t make trouble again.

411
00:36:55,361 --> 00:36:57,361
I promise to follow the rules.

412
00:36:57,453 --> 00:36:58,813
Get along well with my classmates.

413
00:36:58,959 --> 00:37:00,319
And study hard.

414
00:37:00,512 --> 00:37:01,752
That’s great.

415
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:05,479
So please he deserves 
one more chance. Please.

416
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,800
But we’ve had 
so many problems already.

417
00:37:10,143 --> 00:37:13,143
I cannot afford to have any incident.

418
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:17,460
He’s only slightly autistic, 
but it’s not serious.

419
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:20,302
It’s not up to us 
to decide how serious it is.

420
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:24,360
I suggest that you send him 
to a special education school.

421
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,960
He’ll be better off 
in a new environment.

422
00:37:26,333 --> 00:37:27,813
Now I have a meeting to go.

423
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:29,560
Please excuse me.

424
00:38:34,014 --> 00:38:35,374
Xihe’s going to school.

425
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:45,079
Go to class.

426
00:38:53,304 --> 00:38:54,224
Let’s go.

427
00:39:14,495 --> 00:39:15,335
Xihe!

428
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:16,910
Come back!

429
00:39:21,502 --> 00:39:23,702
Didn’t the school ask you to leave?

430
00:39:24,134 --> 00:39:25,534
He has the right to go to school.

431
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,920
Your son should go 
to a special education school.

432
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:31,999
Where he should go 
is not your business.

433
00:39:32,158 --> 00:39:34,558
Don’t you know 
what’s wrong with your son?

434
00:39:34,838 --> 00:39:36,918
He poked my son’s hand with a pencil.

435
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,360
And the principal 
didn’t do anything about it.

436
00:39:38,391 --> 00:39:39,831
He’s shielding you.

437
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:43,160
Your son makes noises in class 
and ignores disciplines...

438
00:39:43,208 --> 00:39:44,888
He’s a bad influence 
on all of our children, right?

439
00:39:44,914 --> 00:39:46,474
-Right!
-That’s right!

440
00:39:52,104 --> 00:39:53,584
We won’t leave this school.

441
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:55,839
My son has the right to go to school.

442
00:39:56,377 --> 00:39:58,097
But you can’t just 
think about yourself!

443
00:39:58,662 --> 00:39:59,582
Exactly!

444
00:39:59,935 --> 00:40:01,415
This should have been 
your own problem.

445
00:40:01,479 --> 00:40:02,879
Now it becomes a burden to us all.

446
00:40:02,959 --> 00:40:04,199
You’re too selfish.

447
00:40:04,784 --> 00:40:05,824
I am his mother.

448
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:07,370
I’ll do what’s best for him!

449
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,680
You are very unreasonable.

450
00:40:13,489 --> 00:40:14,800
Unreasonable?

451
00:40:15,088 --> 00:40:17,688
My son has the legal right
to attend school.

452
00:40:17,784 --> 00:40:19,224
And none of you can take that away!

453
00:40:19,623 --> 00:40:20,503
Okay.

454
00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:22,933
Know what, 
let’s go to see the principal!

455
00:40:22,959 --> 00:40:24,509
-Let’s go.
-Let go of me!

456
00:40:24,535 --> 00:40:25,879
-Go to see the principal!
-What are you doing?

457
00:40:25,879 --> 00:40:27,159
-Let’s go.
-Let me go!

458
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:28,959
-Go.
-Let’s go see the principal.

459
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,719
Let me go! Let me go!

460
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:33,239
-Get off me!
-Let’s go see the principal.

461
00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:34,399
Fine! You come with me.

462
00:40:34,399 --> 00:40:35,239
Let’s go.

463
00:40:35,239 --> 00:40:36,239
Don’t touch my son!

464
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,320
How dare you…

465
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,919
Hey! Hey! Stop it!

466
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,320
-What happened?
-Are you okay?

467
00:40:42,719 --> 00:40:43,560
She bit me!

468
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,760
-She bit you! 
-She bites!

469
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,880
Her son bites people.
And she’s no better!

470
00:40:46,936 --> 00:40:48,616
It’s in their blood!

471
00:41:37,591 --> 00:41:39,240
Here, eat this.

472
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,880
And for you, dear.

473
00:42:15,623 --> 00:42:16,423
Honey.

474
00:42:17,879 --> 00:42:20,159
Dear, please open up.

475
00:42:23,959 --> 00:42:24,879
Honey!

476
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,560
Mr. Zhu, I…

477
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,600
Xihe’s not doing very well.

478
00:42:49,895 --> 00:42:52,215
Hmm, okay.

479
00:42:52,887 --> 00:42:53,967
Thanks, Mr. Zhu.

480
00:42:55,856 --> 00:42:56,896
Xihe!

481
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:00,430
Xihe’s going to school!

482
00:43:06,118 --> 00:43:07,318
No school today!

483
00:43:18,159 --> 00:43:19,080
Hi, Ms. Zhao.

484
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,080
<i>Hi, Mrs. Li.</i>

485
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:24,639
Many parents are concerned about 
what happened yesterday.

486
00:43:25,542 --> 00:43:26,942
I can explain it.

487
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:29,114
<i>After careful consideration,</i>

488
00:43:29,295 --> 00:43:30,414
<i>we’ve decided that...</i>

489
00:43:30,479 --> 00:43:34,879
<i>given Xihe’s condition 
it’s best for him to leave.</i>

490
00:43:35,278 --> 00:43:37,078
<i>I’m so sorry about this.</i>

491
00:43:45,799 --> 00:43:46,839
Mr. Principal…

492
00:43:47,679 --> 00:43:49,679
Couldn’t we reconsider this?

493
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,160
What’s there to be reconsidered?

494
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:53,710
We shouldn’t have
admitted him in the first place.

495
00:43:56,982 --> 00:43:58,022
I’d like to give it a try.

496
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:08,280
Hey! Hey!

497
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:13,535
School.

498
00:44:24,278 --> 00:44:25,198
Stop.

499
00:44:28,048 --> 00:44:29,608
I’m dropping my son off.

500
00:44:29,991 --> 00:44:32,631
Parents aren’t allowed to enter 
for no reason.

501
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,439
Please let us come in.
It’s urgent.

502
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,960
Sorry, I can’t help you.

503
00:44:49,959 --> 00:44:51,359
Xihe’s going to school.

504
00:44:55,639 --> 00:44:56,919
I’m here to see the principal.

505
00:44:56,919 --> 00:44:58,679
You’re not allowed inside.
It’s the rule!

506
00:44:58,719 --> 00:44:59,997
But I’m here to see the principal!

507
00:45:00,023 --> 00:45:01,663
-Please, let me in!
-Don’t make this hard for me.

508
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:03,959
I won’t. Why can’t you just let me in?

509
00:45:03,959 --> 00:45:04,999
Close the gate!

510
00:45:07,869 --> 00:45:08,909
What are you doing?

511
00:45:09,367 --> 00:45:11,367
I’m begging you. Please let me in!

512
00:45:11,943 --> 00:45:13,903
Parents aren’t allowed to go inside!

513
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:20,159
Xihe! Look. It’s Dingding.

514
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:21,670
Hey, Dingding!

515
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,239
Lei Yiming!

516
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:25,599
Come in. Class is about to start.

517
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:28,399
Come in. Come in. Hurry up.

518
00:46:30,879 --> 00:46:32,679
-Come in.
-Come in and play with us.

519
00:46:32,679 --> 00:46:34,080
Hi, Mrs. Li.

520
00:46:34,702 --> 00:46:35,702
Hi, Ms. Zhao.

521
00:46:36,399 --> 00:46:38,959
What you’re doing is useless.

522
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,840
Even if the school admits him again,

523
00:46:40,866 --> 00:46:42,626
we’ll have those parents to deal with.

524
00:46:43,479 --> 00:46:44,719
They’re the crux of the matter.

525
00:46:47,216 --> 00:46:48,456
Do you understand?

526
00:46:51,111 --> 00:46:53,551
I understand. Thank you.

527
00:46:53,943 --> 00:46:55,423
Okay. I need to get back to work.

528
00:47:00,535 --> 00:47:01,720
Come in, Xihe.

529
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:05,510
-Class is going to start. 
-We’re going to class.

530
00:47:13,399 --> 00:47:15,719
Now, now, we all know about it.

531
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:17,200
Stop crying.

532
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,200
You bad boy!

533
00:47:24,247 --> 00:47:25,647
-No, don’t beat him! 
-Don’t beat him.

534
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,480
-Bad boy!
-Don’t beat him!

535
00:47:28,199 --> 00:47:29,439
-Bad boy! Bad boy!
-Stop it!

536
00:47:29,534 --> 00:47:30,814
Calm down!

537
00:47:30,903 --> 00:47:31,983
Don’t beat him!

538
00:47:35,232 --> 00:47:36,240
We’re sorry.

539
00:47:43,646 --> 00:47:45,446
What am I supposed to tell
the girl’s parents?

540
00:47:59,375 --> 00:48:01,815
Ma’am, please vote for me 
to go to school.

541
00:48:02,439 --> 00:48:04,759
Ma’am, please vote for me 
to go to school.

542
00:48:05,191 --> 00:48:07,311
Mister, please vote for me 
to go to school.

543
00:48:07,719 --> 00:48:09,920
Mister, please vote for me
to go to school.

544
00:48:10,591 --> 00:48:13,111
Granddad, please vote for me 
to go to school.

545
00:48:15,239 --> 00:48:18,359
Say it! Granddad, 
please vote for me to go to school.

546
00:48:20,847 --> 00:48:21,847
Come on, say it!

547
00:48:23,407 --> 00:48:25,767
Granddad, please vote for me
to go to school.

548
00:48:26,669 --> 00:48:28,309
Stop it! You are so annoying!

549
00:48:31,688 --> 00:48:33,048
I didn’t mean you.

550
00:48:33,816 --> 00:48:34,816
Come on, say it.

551
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:41,759
Dear, I think…

552
00:48:42,552 --> 00:48:44,352
You don’t need to 
get so worked up over this.

553
00:48:45,853 --> 00:48:47,054
Hopefully it’ll work out.

554
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:49,357
If not, Xihe can always 
go to a special education school.

555
00:48:49,383 --> 00:48:50,423
No way!

556
00:48:51,743 --> 00:48:53,863
Xihe is different from them.

557
00:48:54,470 --> 00:48:56,310
You insist on forcing him there.

558
00:48:56,624 --> 00:48:58,040
He just can’t fit in.

559
00:48:58,719 --> 00:48:59,759
Nonsense!

560
00:48:59,951 --> 00:49:01,792
If he doesn’t go to 
a normal school now,

561
00:49:02,109 --> 00:49:03,669
how’s he supposed to fit in 
with others in the society?

562
00:49:04,215 --> 00:49:05,495
I think…

563
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:08,720
as long as Xihe’s happy, 
nothing else matters.

564
00:49:08,903 --> 00:49:10,823
He’s happy with this school.

565
00:49:11,368 --> 00:49:13,768
But this school isn’t happy with him.

566
00:49:14,679 --> 00:49:16,719
If you don’t support us, 
just get lost!

567
00:49:17,446 --> 00:49:19,406
But… I’m doing a pretty good job here.

568
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,439
Dear… We’re off.

569
00:49:28,439 --> 00:49:30,759
Wait, wait. Let me give you a ride.

570
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:32,360
No. We’ll be fine.

571
00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:33,870
Work hard and earn more money.

572
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:35,560
-Will do. 
-Go.

573
00:49:38,198 --> 00:49:39,358
Take care!

574
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:44,120
Hello?

575
00:49:46,049 --> 00:49:49,209
Move the air conditioner? Sure can do.

576
00:49:49,312 --> 00:49:50,600
From where to where?

577
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:52,880
Okay. Okay.

578
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:54,919
I’ll be there in 20 minutes.

579
00:49:54,945 --> 00:49:56,265
Okay. See you later.

580
00:50:29,651 --> 00:50:31,171
I’m not worried about 
him biting other children.

581
00:50:31,918 --> 00:50:35,038
I’m worried about him 
interfering with my child’s study.

582
00:50:36,704 --> 00:50:39,184
Don’t worry. 
I’ll attend class with him.

583
00:50:39,278 --> 00:50:40,840
I’ll see to it that he doesn’t 
interfere anyone else.

584
00:50:42,791 --> 00:50:45,151
But he has already 
had many times at that.

585
00:50:48,966 --> 00:50:52,006
I promise it absolutely 
won’t happen again!

586
00:50:52,304 --> 00:50:53,664
I don’t doubt your resolution.

587
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,640
He didn’t do it on purpose.

588
00:50:57,016 --> 00:50:58,616
But he can’t control himself.

589
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:00,280
Am I right?

590
00:51:06,151 --> 00:51:07,311
I’m sorry.

591
00:51:20,534 --> 00:51:21,800
So, how do they feel?

592
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:24,199
Fine, a bit tight maybe.

593
00:51:24,199 --> 00:51:25,719
I’ll go and find you another pair.

594
00:51:35,848 --> 00:51:36,888
I don’t need your help.

595
00:51:37,135 --> 00:51:39,495
What would you do if you were me?

596
00:51:44,446 --> 00:51:45,366
Let’s go.

597
00:51:48,238 --> 00:51:49,758
How are those bigger ones feel?

598
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:54,359
What would you do
if your child was autistic?

599
00:51:58,303 --> 00:51:59,543
You are so mean!

600
00:52:05,719 --> 00:52:06,959
I know about autism.

601
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,240
I’ll vote for him.

602
00:52:08,368 --> 00:52:11,608
In this way my child can also learn 
how to help others.

603
00:52:12,014 --> 00:52:13,213
That’s very kind of you.

604
00:52:13,239 --> 00:52:15,160
Then would you mind 
signing this petition?

605
00:52:15,399 --> 00:52:16,359
Okay.

606
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:23,920
Thank you so much.

607
00:52:35,335 --> 00:52:37,560
Mrs. Lei!
Please sign this for Xihe!

608
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:39,440
-Please! I thank you.
-Excuse me.

609
00:52:39,583 --> 00:52:42,303
Please! Mrs. Lei!

610
00:52:42,518 --> 00:52:43,958
He needs your help! Please!

611
00:52:45,855 --> 00:52:46,895
Mrs. Lei!

612
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,040
Please help us!

613
00:52:48,479 --> 00:52:49,519
Get in the car.

614
00:52:50,919 --> 00:52:52,719
-Please sign it. Please!
-Leave us alone, okay?

615
00:52:52,745 --> 00:52:54,464
This is the petition for Xihe 
to go back to school.

616
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:55,360
I’m begging you, please.

617
00:52:55,399 --> 00:52:56,679
Please, please sign it.

618
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:57,734
Go and ask someone else!

619
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:58,797
Please sign your name on it.

620
00:52:58,823 --> 00:53:00,023
Could you please just sign it?

621
00:53:01,263 --> 00:53:04,263
-I’m begging you. 
-I’m busy. Find someone else.

622
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,960
-You finished?
-Yes, sir. All done.

623
00:53:35,439 --> 00:53:37,039
-I’ll pay you for your work.
-Okay.

624
00:53:41,032 --> 00:53:42,072
Here.

625
00:53:45,375 --> 00:53:46,400
Sir, this isn’t right.

626
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,000
Could you give me some more?

627
00:53:49,959 --> 00:53:51,079
We agreed on 500 yuan.

628
00:53:51,105 --> 00:53:54,825
Yes… But that was for 3 units. 
I installed 4.

629
00:53:55,199 --> 00:53:56,599
So I gave you 100 more.

630
00:53:57,022 --> 00:53:58,902
No… Sir, please.

631
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:00,623
Give me a bit more.

632
00:54:02,447 --> 00:54:03,640
50 yuan, okay?

633
00:54:03,887 --> 00:54:05,320
My son’s waiting for me.

634
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:07,040
Just 50 yuan, please.

635
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:08,200
That’s all I’m asking for.

636
00:54:20,246 --> 00:54:21,560
There, catch it.

637
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,160
Daddy, catch.

638
00:54:23,439 --> 00:54:24,399
Again.

639
00:54:32,064 --> 00:54:32,904
Xihe!

640
00:54:43,383 --> 00:54:44,703
This is it.

641
00:54:56,183 --> 00:54:57,383
Dingding!

642
00:54:58,446 --> 00:54:59,720
Dingding!

643
00:55:00,871 --> 00:55:02,711
Hi, Xihe!

644
00:55:03,926 --> 00:55:05,206
Hello, auntie!

645
00:55:05,734 --> 00:55:07,574
Dingding, we came to see you.

646
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,014
I brought you plenty of goodies. Here.

647
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,200
What are you doing here?

648
00:55:10,886 --> 00:55:12,166
Hi, ma’am.

649
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:14,720
I came to apologize to you.

650
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:16,774
I bought something for you. 
Please accept it.

651
00:55:16,847 --> 00:55:17,847
No, thanks.

652
00:55:18,639 --> 00:55:19,919
-Please accept it.
-I don’t want it.

653
00:55:19,919 --> 00:55:20,879
Please!

654
00:55:24,199 --> 00:55:25,399
Please accept it.

655
00:55:26,007 --> 00:55:27,007
Accept it, please.

656
00:55:28,719 --> 00:55:30,280
Dingding, back to the piano.

657
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:31,160
Say it.

658
00:55:32,295 --> 00:55:34,360
Ma’am, please vote for me
to go to school.

659
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:38,040
Ma’am, sorry about the other day. 
I’m sorry.

660
00:55:38,066 --> 00:55:39,226
Ma’am, please.

661
00:55:44,391 --> 00:55:45,391
Put it down.

662
00:56:54,630 --> 00:56:55,470
Honey!

663
00:57:01,344 --> 00:57:03,024
Here, give it to me.

664
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:05,320
You hungry, son?

665
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:15,080
I just don’t see 
why you bother to do this!

666
00:57:35,199 --> 00:57:36,239
Dear…

667
00:57:36,837 --> 00:57:38,318
Is it really worth it?

668
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:39,480
It is!

669
00:57:40,318 --> 00:57:41,238
And…

670
00:57:42,686 --> 00:57:43,926
Take a look at this.

671
00:57:44,143 --> 00:57:46,463
It was written by a foreign mother 
with an autistic child.

672
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:48,760
Her child’s condition 
is much worse than Xihe’s.

673
00:57:48,927 --> 00:57:50,807
And thanks to
attending a normal school,

674
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,040
the child is now working at a library.

675
00:57:53,446 --> 00:57:54,886
But we are in China.

676
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:57,440
Stop talking if you can’t be helpful.

677
00:57:57,613 --> 00:57:59,413
I want Xihe to blend into the society.

678
00:57:59,439 --> 00:58:00,879
So he can lead a normal life.

679
00:58:01,032 --> 00:58:02,431
A foreign mother made it.

680
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:03,799
Why can’t I make it ?

681
00:58:03,871 --> 00:58:04,791
Yes.

682
00:58:04,919 --> 00:58:05,999
She made it.

683
00:58:06,439 --> 00:58:07,879
And she wrote a book.

684
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:10,720
But you can count the books of this
kind on the fingers of one hand.

685
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,600
Hello, sir.

686
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:20,880
-You’re hardworking.
-It’s nothing.

687
00:58:20,919 --> 00:58:23,439
Right. Could you please sign this 
for me?

688
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:25,120
To help my boy get back to school.

689
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:26,680
Eh… This. Sorry, I’m busy.

690
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:28,520
-Please help us! 
-I’m too busy.

691
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:30,040
-Sir, please. 
-Leave me alone.

692
00:58:37,007 --> 00:58:39,087
Why can’t I go to school?

693
00:58:47,526 --> 00:58:48,646
Eat more meat.

694
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:58,400
How’s the result?

695
00:59:58,815 --> 00:59:59,975
Same as before.

696
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,160
It is not!

697
01:00:03,373 --> 01:00:05,213
It’s two points higher, isn’t it?

698
01:00:06,568 --> 01:00:07,568
All right. All right.

699
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:09,720
Two points higher. 
Of course you’re right.

700
01:00:10,167 --> 01:00:11,527
Hey, Xihe.

701
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:13,120
Get down.

702
01:00:13,662 --> 01:00:15,022
That’s dangerous.

703
01:00:17,679 --> 01:00:18,679
Let’s go.

704
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:34,600
Doctor Wang?

705
01:00:35,151 --> 01:00:35,991
Look at his result.

706
01:00:36,143 --> 01:00:37,863
His score is 67 now.

707
01:00:41,104 --> 01:00:42,304
That’s pretty good.

708
01:00:44,103 --> 01:00:45,023
Actually…

709
01:00:45,639 --> 01:00:47,519
There’s nothing scary about 
child’s autism.

710
01:00:48,213 --> 01:00:49,293
The thing is…

711
01:00:49,447 --> 01:00:51,047
As parents, we have 
to be open-minded about it.

712
01:00:51,824 --> 01:00:52,744
In this way,

713
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,760
the whole society 
can better understand autism.

714
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:56,160
-Am I right? 
-Yes.

715
01:00:58,791 --> 01:00:59,791
I support your effort.

716
01:01:00,981 --> 01:01:02,141
Thank you so much.

717
01:01:02,776 --> 01:01:03,760
Xihe!

718
01:01:05,687 --> 01:01:06,807
Xihe, come over here.

719
01:01:08,415 --> 01:01:09,335
Here.

720
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:11,240
Say thank you to Doctor Wang.

721
01:01:11,446 --> 01:01:12,686
Study hard, will you?

722
01:01:18,744 --> 01:01:20,744
We asked you to come here today…

723
01:01:24,373 --> 01:01:28,613
Mrs. Li, after much deliberation,

724
01:01:28,774 --> 01:01:30,654
we came up with 
3 options for you to consider.

725
01:01:31,055 --> 01:01:31,935
First,

726
01:01:32,344 --> 01:01:33,744
send your son 
to a special education school.

727
01:01:33,984 --> 01:01:34,824
Second,

728
01:01:34,959 --> 01:01:36,959
our teachers volunteer to provide...

729
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:41,160
private tutor to your son 
at home on weekends.

730
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:42,399
Third,

731
01:01:42,521 --> 01:01:43,601
I think…

732
01:01:43,655 --> 01:01:44,655
I’m sorry.

733
01:01:44,952 --> 01:01:47,632
But I can’t accept 
any of these options.

734
01:01:49,663 --> 01:01:52,040
We still hope you can 
have my boy back here.

735
01:01:54,719 --> 01:01:56,599
His IQ is over 65.

736
01:01:56,625 --> 01:01:58,305
He’s only slightly autistic.

737
01:01:58,479 --> 01:01:59,760
He’s capable of attending class.

738
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:01,960
Look, his IQ is 67 already.

739
01:02:02,903 --> 01:02:05,823
You see, the school has 
never rejected Xihe.

740
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:08,599
But there’s still the attitude of 
other parents to consider.

741
01:02:08,625 --> 01:02:11,360
I know, many a parent 
doesn’t want Xihe here.

742
01:02:11,399 --> 01:02:13,080
But there’re also some 
who want to help.

743
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:15,639
Look, these are the signatures
of those who support us.

744
01:02:15,665 --> 01:02:16,884
Please take a look.

745
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,640
You’ve made this 
really difficult for us.

746
01:02:23,254 --> 01:02:26,174
We’ve already given him many chances. 
Had he…

747
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,560
I’ll sit next to him in class…

748
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:29,160
For as long as it takes.

749
01:02:39,072 --> 01:02:40,112
Mr. Principal…

750
01:02:40,527 --> 01:02:43,007
I say we give Xihe another chance.

751
01:02:45,391 --> 01:02:46,471
Please!

752
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:59,200
-Hello?
-<i>Zixiang’s grandma?</i>

753
01:02:59,226 --> 01:03:00,320
Hi, Mrs. Li.

754
01:03:00,346 --> 01:03:02,626
<i>Xihe’s allowed to go back to school!</i>

755
01:03:02,652 --> 01:03:05,372
That’s great! Congratulations!

756
01:03:05,631 --> 01:03:06,871
<i>What about Zixiang?</i>

757
01:03:07,439 --> 01:03:09,359
He’s… not going back.

758
01:03:11,719 --> 01:03:12,999
Grandma, come and wash me!

759
01:03:13,072 --> 01:03:14,192
Do it yourself.

760
01:03:15,974 --> 01:03:17,520
Let’s talk another time.

761
01:03:17,551 --> 01:03:18,911
Okay. Bye.

762
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:03,040
Honey?

763
01:04:03,432 --> 01:04:05,192
Let’s go and watch a movie?

764
01:04:07,311 --> 01:04:09,191
Eh… Can we?

765
01:04:09,567 --> 01:04:13,167
With the big flashing screen, 
he’ll be restless.

766
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:14,400
Don’t worry about him.

767
01:04:14,426 --> 01:04:16,066
You go to watch it.

768
01:04:16,173 --> 01:04:17,853
Xihe and I will walk around outside.

769
01:04:17,879 --> 01:04:19,639
And we’ll come back and 
meet you when it’s over.

770
01:04:21,536 --> 01:04:22,696
Just forget it.

771
01:04:22,919 --> 01:04:24,599
We seldom hang out together.

772
01:04:24,686 --> 01:04:26,086
I want to stay with you.

773
01:04:27,088 --> 01:04:28,000
Okay.

774
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:32,240
Xihe.

775
01:04:32,919 --> 01:04:34,319
See the Smurf.

776
01:04:34,719 --> 01:04:36,119
And a puppet.

777
01:04:58,254 --> 01:04:59,414
It’s loud, isn’t it?

778
01:04:59,494 --> 01:05:01,454
It’s not. It looks great on you.

779
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,040
-Hon. 
-What?

780
01:05:07,066 --> 01:05:07,986
Don’t move.

781
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:11,880
You’ve got grey hair!

782
01:05:11,919 --> 01:05:13,000
No, it’s the light.

783
01:05:13,026 --> 01:05:14,666
No, it’s not. Don’t move.

784
01:05:17,031 --> 01:05:18,031
See!

785
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:22,559
That’s nothing new.

786
01:05:23,239 --> 01:05:24,239
No big deal.

787
01:05:25,919 --> 01:05:27,319
-Hon. 
-Eh?

788
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:30,720
For years I’ve been so focused 
on Xihe…

789
01:05:31,341 --> 01:05:32,381
I’m sorry.

790
01:05:34,077 --> 01:05:35,557
We’re family.

791
01:05:36,615 --> 01:05:39,455
I know you’ve been 
through a lot these years.

792
01:05:44,961 --> 01:05:46,161
Xihe, let’s go.

793
01:06:08,639 --> 01:06:10,519
Xihe, is it beautiful?

794
01:06:10,711 --> 01:06:11,791
Beautiful, right?

795
01:06:11,895 --> 01:06:14,175
Fireworks. Fireworks.

796
01:06:14,531 --> 01:06:15,771
Fireworks.

797
01:06:16,094 --> 01:06:17,054
Dear,

798
01:06:17,369 --> 01:06:20,049
many geniuses around the world 
are autistic, you know?

799
01:06:20,135 --> 01:06:21,480
Of course I do.

800
01:06:22,469 --> 01:06:23,549
Let’s name them.

801
01:06:25,991 --> 01:06:27,520
Edison, right?

802
01:06:27,886 --> 01:06:28,926
Yes.

803
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:30,400
And Albert Einstein.

804
01:06:30,879 --> 01:06:33,320
-And Chen Jingrun, I think?
-Yes.

805
01:06:58,206 --> 01:06:59,566
Let’s go to school.

806
01:07:15,895 --> 01:07:16,975
Xihe.

807
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:30,520
Good boy!

808
01:08:19,775 --> 01:08:21,335
Excuse me...

809
01:08:40,144 --> 01:08:41,144
What are you doing?

810
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:45,600
There’re many schools in this city.

811
01:08:46,623 --> 01:08:48,263
Please send your son to another one.

812
01:08:49,319 --> 01:08:50,519
Please!

813
01:08:52,549 --> 01:08:53,760
Please!

814
01:08:53,881 --> 01:08:55,321
Leave our children alone!

815
01:08:55,479 --> 01:08:56,599
I’m begging you.

816
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:57,880
Let go of me.

817
01:08:58,245 --> 01:08:59,605
-Please! 
-Let go!

818
01:09:00,279 --> 01:09:02,399
Ms. Wu, please get up.

819
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:04,400
What’s this all about?

820
01:09:05,399 --> 01:09:06,919
This is way too much.

821
01:09:07,119 --> 01:09:08,679
The children need to start class now!

822
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:13,160
Please,

823
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:14,920
let us discuss this later.

824
01:09:15,143 --> 01:09:16,743
Now let the children have class.

825
01:09:17,399 --> 01:09:18,559
That’s right.

826
01:09:24,648 --> 01:09:25,728
Mrs. Li.

827
01:09:26,486 --> 01:09:27,646
I’m sorry.

828
01:09:28,439 --> 01:09:29,319
You see…

829
01:09:29,406 --> 01:09:31,320
All the children are 
waiting for the class.

830
01:09:32,964 --> 01:09:35,484
Maybe… You should go home.

831
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:46,280
We’re leaving.

832
01:09:53,621 --> 01:09:56,181
How can you be so mean 
to an autistic child?

833
01:09:57,447 --> 01:09:59,480
All he needs is one desk!

834
01:10:01,248 --> 01:10:02,208
Let’s go.

835
01:10:07,623 --> 01:10:09,223
Go to hell!

836
01:10:13,031 --> 01:10:14,031
Let’s go!

837
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:28,720
-Stop! Stop running!
-Stop! Stop running!

838
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:31,080
Come back!

839
01:10:31,831 --> 01:10:33,271
-Stop!
-Stop!

840
01:10:33,895 --> 01:10:35,815
-Get down! 
-Get down from there!

841
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:40,600
Stop!

842
01:10:43,349 --> 01:10:45,229
-Don’t move!
-Stop there!

843
01:10:45,574 --> 01:10:46,774
-Stop!
-Stop!

844
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:48,080
Stop right there!

845
01:10:49,926 --> 01:10:50,926
Stay down!

846
01:10:52,799 --> 01:10:53,799
Stop!

847
01:10:53,825 --> 01:10:55,305
Where are you going to go now?

848
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:59,840
Don’t you move!

849
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:01,520
Zixiang!

850
01:11:01,557 --> 01:11:02,677
-Got you!
-Zixiang!

851
01:11:03,728 --> 01:11:05,407
What are you doing?

852
01:11:05,439 --> 01:11:06,759
He’s just a child!

853
01:11:07,009 --> 01:11:11,089
-What’s wrong with the boy!?
-He’s a pervert! He just touched me!

854
01:11:13,342 --> 01:11:14,262
I’m sorry.

855
01:11:15,998 --> 01:11:16,918
Sorry.

856
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:20,934
-Don’t let him outside.
-Go and teach him a lesson!

857
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:22,360
Next time I’ll call the police!

858
01:11:36,870 --> 01:11:37,830
Grandma!

859
01:11:39,502 --> 01:11:40,822
Grandma! Wash me!

860
01:11:43,721 --> 01:11:45,121
Wash me.

861
01:13:19,975 --> 01:13:20,815
Mum!

862
01:13:21,087 --> 01:13:22,047
Coming!

863
01:13:23,279 --> 01:13:24,799
Lin, you are back!

864
01:13:25,038 --> 01:13:25,958
Mum,

865
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,280
are you feeling better?

866
01:13:27,456 --> 01:13:28,616
Much better.

867
01:13:29,462 --> 01:13:31,142
Xihe, say hi to grandma.

868
01:13:31,375 --> 01:13:32,255
Grandma.

869
01:13:32,303 --> 01:13:34,343
Grandma missed you.

870
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:37,960
Mum, have they found my brother?

871
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:40,760
Someone spotted him.

872
01:13:41,614 --> 01:13:43,254
And the village head 
is out looking for him.

873
01:13:43,418 --> 01:13:44,618
I see.

874
01:13:58,118 --> 01:13:59,038
Xihe!

875
01:13:59,294 --> 01:14:01,014
-Sit down.
-Okay.

876
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:09,120
Xihe!

877
01:14:12,359 --> 01:14:13,319
Leave here!

878
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:23,360
Hurry!

879
01:14:24,502 --> 01:14:26,222
Go on! Move!

880
01:14:27,247 --> 01:14:28,207
Walk!

881
01:14:29,366 --> 01:14:30,406
Move!

882
01:14:31,942 --> 01:14:32,902
Keep walking!

883
01:14:34,399 --> 01:14:35,439
Easy.

884
01:14:35,465 --> 01:14:37,211
-Take it easy!
-Easy?

885
01:14:37,237 --> 01:14:38,437
It was hard enough catching him.

886
01:14:38,479 --> 01:14:39,559
What if he runs away again?

887
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:40,476
Lock him up!

888
01:14:40,502 --> 01:14:43,462
Gui, don’t be afraid! Mum’s here.

889
01:14:48,830 --> 01:14:50,230
Shackle him! Quick!

890
01:14:55,623 --> 01:14:56,783
Hurry! The Shackle!

891
01:14:59,350 --> 01:15:00,390
His ankle…

892
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:01,520
Cage him.

893
01:15:03,879 --> 01:15:05,119
Untie him first.

894
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:13,560
Sir.

895
01:15:13,711 --> 01:15:14,951
-Weld it fast.
-Okay.

896
01:15:14,977 --> 01:15:16,417
No, sir. No.

897
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:17,320
Please don’t do that!

898
01:15:17,359 --> 01:15:18,839
He cannot run away again!

899
01:15:19,116 --> 01:15:19,996
Weld it fast!

900
01:15:20,190 --> 01:15:21,070
Sir,

901
01:15:21,438 --> 01:15:22,918
show some mercy, please.

902
01:15:23,359 --> 01:15:25,880
At least let him see some sunshine.

903
01:15:26,226 --> 01:15:28,586
That’s not my decision.

904
01:15:28,983 --> 01:15:30,783
The whole village 
wants him to be locked up.

905
01:15:31,334 --> 01:15:33,334
Here, sir. Sorry for all the trouble.

906
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:34,760
Please accept this. Drinks are on me.

907
01:15:34,952 --> 01:15:36,232
Please take it.

908
01:15:38,207 --> 01:15:39,167
Look!

909
01:15:39,359 --> 01:15:42,079
He bit me when we caught him today.

910
01:15:43,270 --> 01:15:45,310
I’m so sorry for your trouble!

911
01:15:45,903 --> 01:15:47,200
-Mrs. Tian.
-Yes?

912
01:15:47,664 --> 01:15:49,984
For the sake of your son-in-law,

913
01:15:50,295 --> 01:15:51,815
I’ll give him a last chance.

914
01:15:52,552 --> 01:15:53,712
We’ll leave the welder here.

915
01:15:54,454 --> 01:15:57,254
If he ever bites people again…

916
01:15:57,696 --> 01:15:58,856
we’ll weld the cage.

917
01:15:59,591 --> 01:16:00,671
No one can save him then.

918
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:02,759
-Let’s go.
-Yes, sir.

919
01:16:18,680 --> 01:16:21,080
Mum, take good care of yourself.

920
01:16:21,775 --> 01:16:23,200
My brother needs you.

921
01:16:35,614 --> 01:16:36,854
I’m old.

922
01:16:37,207 --> 01:16:39,607
And I’m getting older and weaker.

923
01:16:39,799 --> 01:16:41,599
I can’t take care of him.

924
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:47,240
Find someone to look after him.

925
01:16:47,597 --> 01:16:48,597
I’ll pay.

926
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:52,240
But I don’t trust anyone else.

927
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:54,000
Mum…

928
01:16:55,406 --> 01:16:57,206
Send him to a mental hospital.

929
01:16:58,527 --> 01:16:59,927
I couldn’t do that.

930
01:17:01,191 --> 01:17:02,880
Don’t mention it again.

931
01:17:03,959 --> 01:17:06,679
Could you take him with you?

932
01:17:08,319 --> 01:17:09,639
Take him with me?

933
01:17:10,319 --> 01:17:12,159
Then who’s going to take care of Xihe?

934
01:17:12,399 --> 01:17:14,880
Isn’t he going to school?

935
01:17:16,615 --> 01:17:17,760
The thing is…

936
01:17:18,399 --> 01:17:21,079
-He’s kicked out of school again. 
-What?

937
01:17:21,567 --> 01:17:23,680
No school would like to admit him now.

938
01:17:25,247 --> 01:17:27,207
I don’t know what to do with him.

939
01:17:27,974 --> 01:17:30,120
What will you do 
with your brother when I died?

940
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:33,160
At least…

941
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,720
he won’t starve if he’s with you.

942
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:39,080
But I can’t.

943
01:17:39,552 --> 01:17:41,472
I’m already exhausted caring for Xihe.

944
01:17:43,879 --> 01:17:47,039
So you’ll just watch your brother die 
without doing anything?

945
01:17:47,871 --> 01:17:49,920
Don’t be so cruel.

946
01:17:53,302 --> 01:17:54,262
Mum,

947
01:17:55,096 --> 01:17:56,456
you think I’m cruel?

948
01:17:57,592 --> 01:17:58,712
You only gave birth to me...

949
01:17:58,806 --> 01:18:00,646
so that I could 
take care of my brother.

950
01:18:01,183 --> 01:18:03,183
Have you ever thought if I liked?

951
01:18:03,488 --> 01:18:04,928
Is this fair to me?

952
01:18:05,767 --> 01:18:07,487
I’m sorry to you.

953
01:18:08,279 --> 01:18:09,799
You think it’s not fair for you.

954
01:18:10,225 --> 01:18:12,505
But your life is still 
much better than his.

955
01:18:12,687 --> 01:18:14,207
That’s the result of my own hard work.

956
01:18:16,576 --> 01:18:19,416
If I hadn’t left,

957
01:18:20,216 --> 01:18:22,456
I’d be just like that 
lock on the cage.

958
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:25,520
He’s still your brother 
no matter what.

959
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:27,720
Then what am I to him?

960
01:18:28,135 --> 01:18:29,215
A servant!

961
01:18:29,871 --> 01:18:31,471
That was the reason 
why I was born into the world.

962
01:18:31,632 --> 01:18:33,872
I’d be his servant my whole life… 
Is that what you want?

963
01:18:36,982 --> 01:18:38,382
If it were up to me,

964
01:18:39,055 --> 01:18:40,895
I’d rather not be born.

965
01:18:42,664 --> 01:18:44,440
What can we do then?

966
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:47,120
It’s our destiny.

967
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:50,320
And you have to accept that.

968
01:18:52,390 --> 01:18:53,430
I will not!

969
01:18:54,541 --> 01:18:56,141
I will change my destiny!

970
01:20:51,558 --> 01:20:52,718
This is your uncle.

971
01:21:35,439 --> 01:21:37,239
Lin!

972
01:21:41,550 --> 01:21:42,510
Go!

973
01:21:43,279 --> 01:21:44,239
Go!

974
01:22:48,136 --> 01:22:49,056
Dear…

975
01:22:52,768 --> 01:22:54,048
About having another child…

976
01:22:55,592 --> 01:22:57,032
I won’t mention it again.

977
01:23:01,584 --> 01:23:04,624
I have you and Xihe.

978
01:23:05,846 --> 01:23:06,966
You are all I want.

979
01:23:44,359 --> 01:23:45,319
Good morning!

980
01:23:45,495 --> 01:23:46,855
Morning, Ms. Tian!

981
01:23:47,173 --> 01:23:48,653
Today we are learning math.

982
01:23:48,798 --> 01:23:50,838
Please turn to page 82 
of your textbook.

983
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:55,120
<i>The train bound for Station Xinxiu 
is arriving.</i>

984
01:23:55,534 --> 01:23:57,534
Let’s look at the butterfly problem.

985
01:23:57,926 --> 01:24:01,406
Xihe, count how many butterflies
there are on the left side.

986
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:06,040
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

987
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:07,840
Correct. There are 8.

988
01:24:07,935 --> 01:24:09,335
What about the right?

989
01:24:10,074 --> 01:24:13,914
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

990
01:24:14,014 --> 01:24:14,893
Right.

991
01:24:14,919 --> 01:24:16,679
How much is 8 plus 7?

992
01:24:16,879 --> 01:24:18,159
15.

993
01:24:18,680 --> 01:24:21,720
We have 8 butterflies on the left 
and 7 on the right.

994
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:23,240
How many butterflies in total?

995
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:24,720
<i>The door is about to close,</i>

996
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:26,000
<i>Please steer clear of the door.</i>

997
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:29,800
The train bound for Chiwan
is arriving.

998
01:24:30,318 --> 01:24:32,518
Please steer clear of the moving door.

999
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:34,080
Thank you for joining us.

1000
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:37,040
I’m reporting live 
from a subway station.

1001
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:37,960
Recently,

1002
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,574
a photo of a mother 
teaching her son in a subway station…

1003
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:42,480
has gone viral over the internet.

1004
01:24:42,506 --> 01:24:43,906
Are you the boy’s mother?

1005
01:24:44,359 --> 01:24:45,560
Why won’t you answer the question?

1006
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:47,279
Why are you doing this?
What’s your purpose?

1007
01:24:47,279 --> 01:24:48,959
How long have you been 
teaching him here?

1008
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,840
Have you thought about 
how this would affect the boy?

1009
01:24:51,088 --> 01:24:52,768
Do you think this will benefit him?

1010
01:24:53,494 --> 01:24:54,974
Are you really his mother?

1011
01:24:55,032 --> 01:24:56,432
Of course I’m his mother!

1012
01:24:57,654 --> 01:25:00,414
-Is this a mere stunt?
-What?

1013
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:01,920
Is this a mere stunt?

1014
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,920
Why are you having class 
in a subway station?

1015
01:25:09,720 --> 01:25:12,240
<i>These photos have gone 
viral over the internet.</i>

1016
01:25:12,359 --> 01:25:14,279
<i>The issue of 
the autistic boy’s schooling…</i>

1017
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:17,240
<i>has inspired a great deal of 
attention and debate.</i>

1018
01:25:17,266 --> 01:25:18,947
<i>A group of volunteers 
called a meeting…</i>

1019
01:25:18,973 --> 01:25:20,453
<i>inviting representatives 
from parties concerned.</i>

1020
01:25:20,479 --> 01:25:22,759
<i>Hopefully they would arrive 
at a proper solution.</i>

1021
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:26,440
<i>To have Li Xihe to study together 
with other students,</i>

1022
01:25:26,790 --> 01:25:28,830
<i>our school is 
under tremendous pressure.</i>

1023
01:25:30,189 --> 01:25:31,669
<i>With coverage of the issue,</i>

1024
01:25:31,799 --> 01:25:33,399
<i>there’s mounting pressure 
on all the teachers.</i>

1025
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:36,080
<i>Who should bear the responsibility?</i>

1026
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:37,960
<i>The government surely 
will do everything we can</i>

1027
01:25:37,986 --> 01:25:40,466
<i>to help those children 
who are suffering from autism.</i>

1028
01:25:40,848 --> 01:25:43,888
<i>We’re about to build 
one more special education school.</i>

1029
01:25:44,460 --> 01:25:45,900
<i>As for attending class 
at normal schools,</i>

1030
01:25:46,024 --> 01:25:48,144
<i>only a fraction of parents 
place such demands.</i>

1031
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:49,560
<i>So we should…</i>

1032
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:53,000
<i>focus on the rights and 
benefits of the majority.</i>

1033
01:25:53,134 --> 01:25:55,454
<i>As the Ministry of Education
you should take a proactive approach.</i>

1034
01:25:55,720 --> 01:25:58,760
<i>Or the issue of inclusive education …</i>

1035
01:25:59,094 --> 01:26:00,534
<i>we’re discussing today 
will only be lip service…</i>

1036
01:26:00,616 --> 01:26:01,816
<i>Empty and hollow.</i>

1037
01:26:02,343 --> 01:26:04,663
<i>When we have to make a choice between
the individual and the community,</i>

1038
01:26:04,680 --> 01:26:05,879
<i>we have to side with the community.</i>

1039
01:26:05,905 --> 01:26:08,225
<i>What we are able to do…</i>

1040
01:26:08,333 --> 01:26:10,893
<i>is to send Xihe 
to a special education school.</i>

1041
01:26:11,023 --> 01:26:12,023
<i>But…</i>

1042
01:26:14,327 --> 01:26:15,527
<i>His mother refused.</i>

1043
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:21,480
<i>We cannot depend all on 
special education schools.</i>

1044
01:26:21,584 --> 01:26:23,600
<i>They cannot accommodate so many needs.</i>

1045
01:26:23,902 --> 01:26:25,782
<i>A society can only 
be called civilized…</i>

1046
01:26:25,887 --> 01:26:30,327
<i>when the rights of its disadvantaged
are respected and guaranteed.</i>

1047
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:31,720
<i>But…</i>

1048
01:26:32,711 --> 01:26:36,071
<i>The rights of other parents also
merit our consideration, right?</i>

1049
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:40,520
<i>Many of them know nothing 
about autism.</i>

1050
01:26:46,446 --> 01:26:48,840
<i>Xihe is an autistic boy.</i>

1051
01:26:49,382 --> 01:26:51,662
<i>This is the reality and 
I can’t change it.</i>

1052
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:57,680
<i>What I can change is myself…
and the society he lives in.</i>

1053
01:26:58,319 --> 01:27:00,519
<i>Xihe needs to blend into the society.</i>

1054
01:27:01,111 --> 01:27:04,231
<i>But I can’t make it only with 
my own effort.</i>

1055
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:06,880
<i>I alone cannot surmount 
such an immense obstacle.</i>

1056
01:27:11,248 --> 01:27:12,368
<i>And now…</i>

1057
01:27:16,544 --> 01:27:17,544
<i>I have no dream...</i>

1058
01:27:19,215 --> 01:27:20,815
<i>for the rest of my life</i>

1059
01:27:23,319 --> 01:27:25,119
<i>but this one…</i>

1060
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:27,280
<i>That is…</i>

1061
01:27:29,570 --> 01:27:32,010
<i>I hope that normal people 
in our society…</i>

1062
01:27:33,089 --> 01:27:34,929
<i>can accept my boy as he is.</i>

1063
01:27:37,174 --> 01:27:38,253
<i>I have this dream.</i>

1064
01:27:38,319 --> 01:27:40,679
<i>Xihe lives a normal life in our world.</i>

1065
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:43,040
<i>Walking down the street,</i>

1066
01:27:43,366 --> 01:27:45,206
<i>he might behave oddly.</i>

1067
01:27:46,319 --> 01:27:48,519
<i>But please don’t look down upon him.</i>

1068
01:27:50,143 --> 01:27:52,503
<i>All he needs is a friendly smile.</i>

1069
01:27:54,287 --> 01:27:55,567
<i>That would be enough.</i>

1070
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:28,520
There they are.

1071
01:28:28,694 --> 01:28:29,534
Hello, Ms. Tian.

1072
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:30,759
How are things going for you
and your son?

1073
01:28:30,759 --> 01:28:32,119
-Are you still teaching him...
-No photos.

1074
01:28:32,144 --> 01:28:33,958
at the subway station?

1075
01:28:33,959 --> 01:28:35,839
Please leave us alone. Please.

1076
01:28:35,839 --> 01:28:40,720
Thank you all. Please leave us alone.

1077
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:42,839
-Could you take our questions? 
-Just say a few words.

1078
01:28:42,839 --> 01:28:44,160
No. No. I have nothing to say.

1079
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:45,360
And please stay away.

1080
01:28:45,386 --> 01:28:47,986
-You’re intruding on our life.
-Please talk to us.

1081
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,120
We’re now reporting live 
from where Xihe lives.

1082
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:58,000
Please stay tuned.

1083
01:28:58,654 --> 01:28:59,974
Keep filming.

1084
01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:01,399
Again Ms. Tian refused 
our interview request.

1085
01:29:01,425 --> 01:29:02,785
This is the 24-hour program of
Xili cable station.

1086
01:29:02,811 --> 01:29:06,011
We’ll be staying and waiting 
for our next meeting with Ms. Tian.

1087
01:29:11,136 --> 01:29:12,296
You’ve decided?

1088
01:29:13,647 --> 01:29:14,687
I have.

1089
01:29:15,640 --> 01:29:17,160
At this point in time,

1090
01:29:17,680 --> 01:29:19,720
my son needs my constant attention.

1091
01:29:20,870 --> 01:29:23,030
I have no other choice.

1092
01:29:24,551 --> 01:29:27,151
I thought the media coverage is
doing you good, isn’t it?

1093
01:29:30,895 --> 01:29:31,815
Mr. President,

1094
01:29:32,168 --> 01:29:34,928
I am very grateful for what you did.

1095
01:29:35,472 --> 01:29:38,432
But please don’t involve 
the media again.

1096
01:29:38,855 --> 01:29:40,335
If things continue like this,

1097
01:29:40,919 --> 01:29:44,119
I’m afraid no school 
would ever accept my son.

1098
01:29:46,815 --> 01:29:47,975
So you’ve made up your mind?

1099
01:29:48,831 --> 01:29:49,911
Yes, I have.

1100
01:29:54,455 --> 01:29:55,455
Xihe.

1101
01:29:56,240 --> 01:29:58,400
Mr. President, thank you.

1102
01:30:01,327 --> 01:30:02,247
Let’s go.

1103
01:30:26,319 --> 01:30:30,240
Dear uncles and aunties, 
grandmas and grandpas.

1104
01:30:30,790 --> 01:30:31,750
Hello.

1105
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:33,640
My name is Li Xihe.

1106
01:30:34,398 --> 01:30:36,558
I’m suffering from mild autism.

1107
01:30:37,688 --> 01:30:42,200
I have trouble communicating 
with others.

1108
01:30:43,231 --> 01:30:45,311
I want to attend a normal school.

1109
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:50,160
I can learn how to interact 
with others there.

1110
01:30:52,544 --> 01:30:54,624
My IQ is 67.

1111
01:30:55,799 --> 01:30:59,079
I can learn just like anyone else.

1112
01:31:00,943 --> 01:31:04,183
I made troubles before.

1113
01:31:04,971 --> 01:31:06,811
And I am sorry for what I did.

1114
01:31:07,984 --> 01:31:10,584
Please accept my sincere apology.

1115
01:31:11,790 --> 01:31:16,230
I promise I won’t 
make any troubles again.

1116
01:31:17,584 --> 01:31:20,584
I’ll try to be friends with
your child.

1117
01:31:21,790 --> 01:31:24,350
Please help me get back to school.

1118
01:31:25,479 --> 01:31:28,799
Your support will change my life.
