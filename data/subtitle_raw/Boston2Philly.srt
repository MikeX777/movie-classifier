1
00:00:10,488 --> 00:00:12,360
- One of the real fears as
we head into this evening,

2
00:00:12,403 --> 00:00:14,971
the winds, up to
75 miles an hour

3
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,147
and the power now
a real concern.

4
00:00:17,191 --> 00:00:19,671
Meteorologist Rob
Marciano in Boston tonight

5
00:00:19,715 --> 00:00:21,586
where authorities are
urging everyone to

6
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,675
take these blizzard
warnings seriously.

7
00:00:36,819 --> 00:00:38,864
- Any idea where he
may have run off to?

8
00:00:38,908 --> 00:00:40,214
Girlfriend's house?

9
00:00:40,257 --> 00:00:41,345
Neighborhood park?

10
00:00:42,781 --> 00:00:44,740
We need something here.

11
00:00:44,783 --> 00:00:46,307
- It's getting late, George.

12
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,483
We need to figure out what
we're gonna do about all this.

13
00:00:48,526 --> 00:00:49,875
The press is gonna
be looking for

14
00:00:49,919 --> 00:00:52,748
answers and I need
to be informed.

15
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:55,011
And I haven't slept for
hours, for Christ's sake!

16
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,492
- I don't give a damn
how late it's gettin'!

17
00:00:57,535 --> 00:00:58,928
That's one of ours out there.

18
00:00:58,971 --> 00:01:01,322
And this kid is telling
me you're taking him away.

19
00:01:01,365 --> 00:01:02,236
- Come on now, Coach.

20
00:01:02,279 --> 00:01:03,933
Alright, that's not fair.

21
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:06,588
We didn't want this to go down

22
00:01:06,631 --> 00:01:09,112
the way that it
did, you know that.

23
00:01:09,156 --> 00:01:11,636
- You could have waited
till after the game.

24
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,073
I mean, we had college scouts in

25
00:01:13,116 --> 00:01:15,423
the stands, for Christ's sake!

26
00:01:15,466 --> 00:01:17,729
The whole entire city
watched you shatter

27
00:01:17,773 --> 00:01:20,428
this kid's dream,
right on center stage.

28
00:01:22,865 --> 00:01:25,868
There has to be something we
can do to keep him here, right?

29
00:01:27,826 --> 00:01:30,133
- We've tracked down
his only other relative.

30
00:01:30,177 --> 00:01:31,743
He has a godmother
in Philadelphia

31
00:01:31,787 --> 00:01:33,267
that we haven't reached yet.

32
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:36,835
Once we do, we have no choice
but to follow protocol.

33
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:38,141
There's no way around it.

34
00:01:39,838 --> 00:01:41,710
- It's bad enough
we lost the game.

35
00:01:42,798 --> 00:01:44,756
Now our star player vows never

36
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,280
to pick up a basketball again.

37
00:01:47,585 --> 00:01:48,847
And on top of that
you're telling me

38
00:01:48,891 --> 00:01:50,632
you're taking him
away to Philadelphia!

39
00:01:52,895 --> 00:01:56,812
We have, we had,

40
00:01:56,855 --> 00:01:58,988
the best team in the
whole damn state.

41
00:02:00,381 --> 00:02:02,296
Now you're tearing
away one of our own.

42
00:02:03,862 --> 00:02:06,517
- I made promises to certain
colleges that I need to keep.

43
00:02:06,561 --> 00:02:08,650
You gotta figure out how
to keep him in Boston!

44
00:02:08,693 --> 00:02:10,173
- Enough, enough!

45
00:02:13,611 --> 00:02:16,136
It's time to stop thinking
about what's best for us.

46
00:02:17,267 --> 00:02:19,617
Start thinking about
what's best for the boy.

47
00:02:19,661 --> 00:02:20,662
- I agree with that.

48
00:02:21,924 --> 00:02:23,882
- The kid's a senior.

49
00:02:23,926 --> 00:02:26,494
On my assessment he will be
a high risk of depression.

50
00:02:26,537 --> 00:02:30,019
Isolation and guilt may take
a lot of time to get over.

51
00:02:30,062 --> 00:02:32,761
I don't see him
picking up a ball soon.

52
00:02:32,804 --> 00:02:34,023
Whether or not he will fight to

53
00:02:34,066 --> 00:02:36,199
stay or not isn't
our call, or his.

54
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,028
It's his parents.

55
00:02:39,071 --> 00:02:40,899
- His parents are dead!

56
00:02:40,943 --> 00:02:42,684
And what the hell do you know?

57
00:02:42,727 --> 00:02:44,251
- I know a whole lot!

58
00:02:44,294 --> 00:02:46,383
And I don't have to sit here
and listen to some stuck up,

59
00:02:46,427 --> 00:02:48,864
greedy bitch telling me
what I know is certain.

60
00:02:48,907 --> 00:02:51,693
He ran away to be
alone, that's isolation.

61
00:02:51,736 --> 00:02:52,911
He probably is
feeling responsible

62
00:02:52,955 --> 00:02:54,783
for the crash, that's guilt.

63
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,090
Do I need to speak
slower for you?

64
00:03:01,006 --> 00:03:02,965
- Look, I know this kid.

65
00:03:04,923 --> 00:03:06,098
He loves it here.

66
00:03:07,752 --> 00:03:09,537
He won't want to leave.

67
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:12,757
- Even if he did, there
is nothing we can do.

68
00:03:12,801 --> 00:03:13,889
He has a godmother.

69
00:03:15,151 --> 00:03:16,370
There's documents.

70
00:03:18,067 --> 00:03:19,068
- What's it gonna take to make

71
00:03:19,111 --> 00:03:20,809
this kid stay where he belongs?

72
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:24,813
We can persuade him to
go to college locally.

73
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:28,773
We can all get
something out of this.

74
00:03:29,687 --> 00:03:30,993
- We could lose the file.

75
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:35,911
It wouldn't be hard to
convince 'em about that.

76
00:03:35,954 --> 00:03:37,478
- I don't believe this.

77
00:03:37,521 --> 00:03:38,783
You people make me sick!

78
00:03:39,828 --> 00:03:41,264
He's not even 18 years old yet.

79
00:03:42,657 --> 00:03:44,180
I'll go find him and tell him

80
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,051
that everything
is gonna be okay.

81
00:03:46,095 --> 00:03:48,010
That's what he needs
to hear right now.

82
00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:12,034
- Rome!

83
00:04:20,085 --> 00:04:21,435
Son, come back in.

84
00:04:23,132 --> 00:04:24,176
- Don't touch me!

85
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,528
And don't call me that!

86
00:04:29,878 --> 00:04:31,140
I'm not your son!

87
00:04:35,623 --> 00:04:37,407
- Look, I know you're hurting.

88
00:04:39,888 --> 00:04:43,761
And I understand, I
really do, but it's cold.

89
00:04:43,805 --> 00:04:44,980
It's cold out here, come back in

90
00:04:45,023 --> 00:04:46,329
so we can deal
with this together.

91
00:04:46,373 --> 00:04:48,026
- Don't touch me!

92
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,332
There's no dealing with this!

93
00:04:50,594 --> 00:04:52,422
There's never any
dealing with this!

94
00:04:54,468 --> 00:04:55,904
I lost my family!

95
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,863
I lost my home!

96
00:05:01,518 --> 00:05:02,780
They're sending me away!

97
00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:06,218
And what are you doing about it?

98
00:05:06,262 --> 00:05:07,045
Nothing!

99
00:05:09,134 --> 00:05:10,266
It's on you, Coach!

100
00:05:12,094 --> 00:05:13,138
This is on you!

101
00:05:13,182 --> 00:05:14,966
- I've always been
there for you.

102
00:05:19,884 --> 00:05:23,061
Look, I know you're
hurting, but please.

103
00:05:25,586 --> 00:05:29,198
I've always been there for you
and that's not gonna change.

104
00:05:31,156 --> 00:05:32,941
So please come back in
so we can deal with this.

105
00:05:32,984 --> 00:05:36,074
Don't touch me!

106
00:05:36,118 --> 00:05:37,162
This is on you!

107
00:05:39,382 --> 00:05:40,644
This is on you!

108
00:05:44,169 --> 00:05:44,953
I'm done!

109
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,524
I'm done!

110
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,483
I'm done!

111
00:08:04,179 --> 00:08:05,963
Upstairs to the left?

112
00:08:06,007 --> 00:08:06,790
- Yeah.

113
00:08:09,184 --> 00:08:10,359
Rome, wait.

114
00:08:17,845 --> 00:08:21,022
When I heard the news I
was, I was on a date and

115
00:08:22,327 --> 00:08:24,504
I was with this guy and
I just broke down crying.

116
00:08:25,548 --> 00:08:27,071
The poor bastard.

117
00:08:27,115 --> 00:08:30,858
But, I was just thinking about

118
00:08:32,163 --> 00:08:35,166
my work and how to cook
for you and laundry

119
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:36,516
and what if I bring a guy home?

120
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,344
And what if you
bring a girl home?

121
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:45,612
I never thought about
how you were thinking,

122
00:08:45,655 --> 00:08:46,787
not for a second.

123
00:08:50,225 --> 00:08:52,749
I am not ready for
this responsibility.

124
00:08:53,663 --> 00:08:55,404
I told her and I begged her,

125
00:08:55,447 --> 00:08:58,320
please give this job
to somebody else.

126
00:08:58,363 --> 00:09:03,281
But I love your mother as a
sister and I gave her my word.

127
00:09:06,328 --> 00:09:09,723
I'm gonna do the best
that I can for you.

128
00:09:13,074 --> 00:09:13,857
- Are you done?

129
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,033
Yes.

130
00:09:17,252 --> 00:09:19,167
- Upstairs to the left?

131
00:09:20,429 --> 00:09:21,212

trying to say what's up.

177
00:12:26,223 --> 00:12:27,616
- Trying to say what's up?

178
00:12:27,659 --> 00:12:29,531
I know what you
was trying to do.

179
00:12:29,574 --> 00:12:30,837
Wait a minute.

180
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,187
- Whatever, I don't
care what you drive.

181
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:36,407
I don't care how awesome
your jumpshot is.

182
00:12:36,451 --> 00:12:37,669
- I didn't even say that.

183
00:12:37,713 --> 00:12:39,541
- I've heard it, I've
seen it all before.

184
00:12:39,584 --> 00:12:41,891
Can a girl just get
through her day?

185
00:12:41,935 --> 00:12:42,762
Hey!

186
00:12:47,984 --> 00:12:49,943
Hey, I was talking.

187
00:12:51,161 --> 00:12:53,120
- I'm sorry, but
this is incredible.

188
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:58,647
- I guess, it's a building.

189
00:12:58,690 --> 00:12:59,866
- It's more than that.

190
00:12:59,909 --> 00:13:01,389
There are some people
that can walk by

191
00:13:01,432 --> 00:13:05,480
something amazing, something
undeniably majestic,

192
00:13:05,523 --> 00:13:08,570
and never appreciate
the magic that's there.

193
00:13:08,613 --> 00:13:10,790
I've never been one
of those people.

194
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,356
If I see something that
takes my breath away

195
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,663
I'm gonna learn about it,
I'm gonna stare at it.

196
00:13:16,056 --> 00:13:18,101
I'm gonna follow it
through a train station

197
00:13:18,145 --> 00:13:19,102
and learn her name.

198
00:13:24,891 --> 00:13:26,196
- That's sweet.

199
00:13:27,284 --> 00:13:29,112
That's really sweet.

200
00:13:31,114 --> 00:13:32,855
- So why were you
crying back there?

201
00:13:34,726 --> 00:13:35,597
- I wasn't crying.

202
00:13:37,555 --> 00:13:39,383
- You don't have to
be that way with me.

203
00:13:40,689 --> 00:13:42,169
- I don't even know you.

204
00:13:42,212 --> 00:13:43,648
I wasn't crying, you're wrong.

205
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:45,694
- Wait, hold on.

206
00:13:45,737 --> 00:13:49,219
Change that, get to know me.

207
00:13:49,263 --> 00:13:50,438
Let me get to know you.

208
00:13:54,921 --> 00:13:58,446
- I've had a rough day
and I can't do this.

209
00:14:01,797 --> 00:14:05,670
- I'm not gonna say I know
what you're going through.

210
00:14:05,714 --> 00:14:08,412
No one ever knows
how deep the hurt is,

211
00:14:09,631 --> 00:14:11,763
unless they're the one
that's going through it.

212
00:14:16,594 --> 00:14:17,726
- You've got a way with words.

213
00:14:20,076 --> 00:14:21,686
- I bet you, if
you got to know me,

214
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:24,602
you'd find more things
you like about me.

215
00:14:28,345 --> 00:14:30,652
- So what do you wanna do?

216
00:14:30,695 --> 00:14:32,654
- Let me steal you away.

217
00:14:32,697 --> 00:14:34,786
We'll do whatever we want.

218
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:35,613
Can I do that?

219
00:14:37,572 --> 00:14:38,616
- Yeah.

220
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,663
Yeah, you can do that.

221
00:14:46,624 --> 00:14:48,322
Oh, my God, it's
like right there!

222
00:14:48,365 --> 00:14:50,237
Why did I not see that?

223
00:14:59,811 --> 00:15:01,683
It's amazing how
things work out.

224
00:15:05,469 --> 00:15:06,427
- What do you mean?

225
00:15:07,471 --> 00:15:09,778
- I've lived here my entire life

226
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,912
and I never really
remembered what it

227
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:14,957
was like to see everything
for the first time.

228
00:15:16,741 --> 00:15:18,787
We're looking at swans.

229
00:15:20,006 --> 00:15:21,833
I don't know, you're
bringing me back.

230
00:15:23,661 --> 00:15:25,968
- Philadelphia definitely
has something going on.

231
00:15:31,626 --> 00:15:32,714
Why were you crying?

232
00:15:34,716 --> 00:15:35,630
- I wasn't crying.

233
00:15:36,587 --> 00:15:38,850
- Don't, just...

234
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:43,899
You can trust me.

235
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,814
- I don't trust anyone.

236
00:16:05,442 --> 00:16:06,835
I have someone in my life.

237
00:16:11,448 --> 00:16:12,797
- Of course, you do.

238
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,671
- I'm sorry.

239
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:23,983
- The good ones always have
someone in their lives.

240
00:16:26,637 --> 00:16:28,465
Problem is, it's
never the right one.

241
00:16:34,906 --> 00:16:36,604
- Thank you for this.

242
00:16:38,258 --> 00:16:39,041
It helped, but I should go.

243
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:50,531
- Hey, hey!

244
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,364
Hey!

245
00:17:01,933 --> 00:17:03,413
I guess I'll see you around?

246
00:17:06,634 --> 00:17:07,896
- If you're lucky you won't.

247
00:17:10,116 --> 00:17:11,204
- Can I get your name?

248
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:15,643
- Philly.

249
00:17:16,731 --> 00:17:17,906
And yours?

250
00:17:23,303 --> 00:17:24,086
- Boston.

251
00:17:25,783 --> 00:17:28,743
- Okay.

252
00:17:34,531 --> 00:17:37,099
- Yo, you ready for this?

253
00:17:37,143 --> 00:17:38,970
I don't know, man.

254
00:17:39,014 --> 00:17:40,929
I'm not really feeling it.

255
00:17:40,972 --> 00:17:42,626
You're not feeling what?

256
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:43,714
- This, man.

257
00:17:44,976 --> 00:17:45,890
I'm not feeling it.

258
00:17:48,806 --> 00:17:50,156
- Don't do this right now.

259
00:17:50,199 --> 00:17:51,853
I mean, we already
went over this.

260
00:17:52,984 --> 00:17:54,812
Don't tell me
you're bitchin' out!

261
00:17:54,856 --> 00:17:57,859
- Yo, you gotta stop
playing thug, man.

262
00:17:59,513 --> 00:18:00,949
That's not us!

263
00:18:00,992 --> 00:18:02,124
Never has been, never will.

264
00:18:04,387 --> 00:18:07,825
We gotta find another way
to make this money up.

265
00:18:07,869 --> 00:18:10,350
- G, well, you tell
me and we could do it!

266
00:18:12,743 --> 00:18:14,354
I mean, this is our reality!

267
00:18:14,397 --> 00:18:16,573
You don't want me to go
to that white-ass school!

268
00:18:18,967 --> 00:18:20,795
We need white people money!

269
00:18:20,838 --> 00:18:22,840
You really think they gonna
give a brother a loan?

270
00:18:22,884 --> 00:18:24,755
- You don't think I know that?

271
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,322
I know that!

272
00:18:26,366 --> 00:18:28,672
I also know we made it this
far to get put in a box!

273
00:18:31,197 --> 00:18:32,633
Look, I'm not bailing out.

274
00:18:33,808 --> 00:18:35,418
I just want you to
know the consequences

275
00:18:35,462 --> 00:18:36,985
in case this shit heads south.

276
00:18:37,028 --> 00:18:39,596
If this shit heads
south that's it for us!

277
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,380
We done!

278
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:50,781
- Jay's too drunk
to chase his dream.

279
00:18:50,825 --> 00:18:52,827
I mean, we was about
that trapped life.

280
00:18:55,438 --> 00:18:56,874
To me it seems like
everybody had to get

281
00:18:56,918 --> 00:18:59,138
they hands dirty to
get what they want.

282
00:19:12,499 --> 00:19:13,282
You ready?

283
00:19:58,588 --> 00:19:59,763
Don't say a word.

284
00:19:59,807 --> 00:20:01,896
Don't say a fucking word.

285
00:20:03,158 --> 00:20:04,899
We ain't here to hurt you.

286
00:20:04,942 --> 00:20:07,858
We gonna leave and
you will say nothing!

287
00:20:07,902 --> 00:20:09,120
You got me?

288
00:20:09,164 --> 00:20:10,078
You got me?

289
00:20:15,257 --> 00:20:16,519
Good shit, man.

290
00:20:23,961 --> 00:20:25,180
Stop!

291
00:20:26,312 --> 00:20:28,139
Alright,
let's go, we good.

292
00:20:28,183 --> 00:20:30,011
No, we ain't good yet!

293
00:20:30,054 --> 00:20:30,925
What?

294
00:20:32,013 --> 00:20:33,493
You think 'cause you've

295
00:20:33,536 --> 00:20:36,887
got money you're better than us?

296
00:20:36,931 --> 00:20:39,760
You're the worst white
woman in the world!

297
00:20:39,803 --> 00:20:41,065
No real work.

298
00:20:41,109 --> 00:20:44,068
Simply out here
doing what we gotta!

299
00:20:44,112 --> 00:20:46,201
But you don't see it like that.

300
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,508
You think we animals!

301
00:20:48,551 --> 00:20:51,293
You think we don't
know no better.

302
00:20:56,342 --> 00:20:59,693
Come on,
that's it, I'm done!

303
00:20:59,736 --> 00:21:01,390
I'm done robbing these houses.

304
00:21:01,434 --> 00:21:02,696
We shouldn't even be
here in the first place.

305
00:21:02,739 --> 00:21:07,048
I can't believe you
got me into this mess!

306
00:21:07,091 --> 00:21:08,267
I got you into this?

307
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,659
Yeah, you did.

308
00:21:09,703 --> 00:21:11,008
You losing your head.

309
00:21:11,052 --> 00:21:11,835
You weak!

310
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,274
How you gonna pay
for college, G?

311
00:21:16,492 --> 00:21:18,146
How you gonna pay
for your books?

312
00:21:18,189 --> 00:21:19,495
You need this!

313
00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:21,236
I'm done with it.

314
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,585
We can't be runnin'
into these houses

315
00:21:22,629 --> 00:21:24,631
and being activists,
that's stupid!

316
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,155
This ain't us!

317
00:21:28,112 --> 00:21:29,766
I'll find my way.

318
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:32,160
After this shit I'm done!

319
00:21:32,203 --> 00:21:33,944
Did you forget
you're going to go to

320
00:21:33,988 --> 00:21:35,772
that white-ass
school and leave me?

321
00:21:35,816 --> 00:21:37,296
You fake-ass nigga!

322
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,961
- Take off the hat.

323
00:21:57,838 --> 00:21:59,143
My name is--

324
00:21:59,187 --> 00:22:00,971
- I know what your name
is, Wilkerson, Gideon.

325
00:22:01,015 --> 00:22:02,190
What I don't know is how you

326
00:22:02,233 --> 00:22:04,105
ended up sitting in front of me.

327
00:22:05,367 --> 00:22:07,369
You were one step away
from being enrolled in one

328
00:22:07,413 --> 00:22:10,503
of the best universities
this state can offer.

329
00:22:10,546 --> 00:22:11,982
But as of a few months
ago you were also

330
00:22:12,026 --> 00:22:15,246
one step away from
spending some time in jail.

331
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:16,770
- I'd rather focus
on the present,

332
00:22:16,813 --> 00:22:18,989
not the past, if you don't mind.

333
00:22:19,033 --> 00:22:21,818
- Excellent grades throughout
your high school career,

334
00:22:21,862 --> 00:22:24,255
but your rap sheet is
just as impressive.

335
00:22:25,169 --> 00:22:26,997
How could you think
you could even go here,

336
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:30,653
let alone ask the college
to pay the money for it?

337
00:22:31,828 --> 00:22:33,569
- How could I think
I could go here?

338
00:22:33,613 --> 00:22:34,614
How could I not?

339
00:22:34,657 --> 00:22:36,137
- Excuse me?

340
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,531
- About 45 % of black children
graduate high school.

341
00:22:38,574 --> 00:22:40,184
One in three black
males can expect

342
00:22:40,228 --> 00:22:42,099
to go to jail in their life.

343
00:22:42,143 --> 00:22:43,840
Probably spend their
18th birthday in jail.

344
00:22:43,884 --> 00:22:45,146
- I understand--

345
00:22:45,189 --> 00:22:46,539
- A young black male
is more likely to die

346
00:22:46,582 --> 00:22:49,150
by gunfire than any soldier
has done in Vietnam.

347
00:22:49,193 --> 00:22:50,369
- You know your stuff.

348
00:22:50,412 --> 00:22:52,022
- I spent my 18th
birthday a free man

349
00:22:52,066 --> 00:22:54,024
applying to this university.

350
00:22:54,068 --> 00:22:56,070
So if I could survive
all that and more

351
00:22:56,113 --> 00:22:58,812
I can at least think I
can make it anywhere.

352
00:22:58,855 --> 00:23:01,031
I just need the financial aid.

353
00:23:01,075 --> 00:23:02,511
- You are something.

354
00:23:03,817 --> 00:23:05,688
So tell me, should
I overlook the

355
00:23:05,732 --> 00:23:08,474
drug possession with
intent to distribute?

356
00:23:08,517 --> 00:23:10,127
The fights?

357
00:23:10,171 --> 00:23:12,695
The board wear ring you may
or may not be involved in?

358
00:23:14,697 --> 00:23:17,570
I want to help you but
help me to understand this.

359
00:23:19,093 --> 00:23:20,311
I mean, what were
you even thinking

360
00:23:20,355 --> 00:23:22,096
getting involved in this stuff?

361
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:26,405
- There's a term, affluenza.

362
00:23:26,448 --> 00:23:28,145
Excuse me?

363
00:24:01,701 --> 00:24:02,789
- This shit is crazy.

364
00:24:04,051 --> 00:24:05,879
It's called affluenza.

365
00:24:05,922 --> 00:24:07,620
That anybody does not
understand the consequences

366
00:24:07,663 --> 00:24:11,450
of one's actions based
on financial privilege.

367
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:12,581
- What?

368
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:13,408
Man, I don't believe that.

369
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,018
- Believe it, it's real.

370
00:24:15,062 --> 00:24:19,196
See, there was this rich kid
that hit a bunch of folks

371
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,461
in his whip and he got
off because he had money.

372
00:24:24,637 --> 00:24:25,768
- What do you mean?

373
00:24:25,812 --> 00:24:27,117
What are you saying?

374
00:24:27,161 --> 00:24:28,379
- Think about it.

375
00:24:28,423 --> 00:24:32,209
All we know, people
selling, people robbing.

376
00:24:32,253 --> 00:24:33,559
Shit, we got family members in

377
00:24:33,602 --> 00:24:35,648
they 30's still in
that trapped life.

378
00:24:35,691 --> 00:24:38,651
We risk whatever 'cause if
we don't life ain't shit.

379
00:24:40,348 --> 00:24:42,176
We not worrying about the consequences 'cause we too broke.

380
00:24:44,961 --> 00:24:48,661
- And what are your thoughts
now on this reversed affluenza?

381
00:24:48,704 --> 00:24:49,792
- I think he was wrong.

382
00:24:50,967 --> 00:24:53,317
We knew exactly
what we were doing.

383
00:24:53,361 --> 00:24:55,755
We just didn't care.

384
00:24:55,798 --> 00:24:56,973
- You are remarkable.

385
00:25:04,764 --> 00:25:05,765
- Thank you.

386
00:25:22,259 --> 00:25:23,130
- Sit down.

387
00:25:25,349 --> 00:25:27,917
Look at all the fresh meat.

388
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:32,661
You're laughing
now, you might not

389
00:25:32,705 --> 00:25:34,924
be laughing when I'm done.

390
00:25:36,317 --> 00:25:38,232
My name is Gerard Balan.

391
00:25:38,275 --> 00:25:42,236
You don't know me and,
honestly, I prefer it that way.

392
00:25:43,803 --> 00:25:46,414
This is my first
year as a professor

393
00:25:46,457 --> 00:25:49,591
and I plan on taking a
more unconventional route

394
00:25:49,635 --> 00:25:53,029
to teaching the bright young
minds of this generation.

395
00:25:53,073 --> 00:25:57,077
I won't bore you with my
rap sheet or my resume,

396
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,949
but here's what you
do need to know.

397
00:25:59,993 --> 00:26:03,039
I have a net worth of
six million dollars.

398
00:26:03,083 --> 00:26:07,174
And I also have permission
from the dean herself

399
00:26:07,217 --> 00:26:10,351
to conduct this
course as I see fit.

400
00:26:10,394 --> 00:26:11,308
Okay?

401
00:26:11,352 --> 00:26:13,397
I'm not here to be your father.

402
00:26:14,529 --> 00:26:17,488
I'm not here to teach
you some useless

403
00:26:17,532 --> 00:26:21,275
stuff you'll either
never remember or forget.

404
00:26:21,318 --> 00:26:23,494
I'm not here to hold your hand.

405
00:26:23,538 --> 00:26:26,149
I'm here to prepare
you for life.

406
00:26:28,021 --> 00:26:30,632
I want you to develop a deeper

407
00:26:30,676 --> 00:26:32,895
understanding of
your inner self.

408
00:26:34,462 --> 00:26:37,334
I want you to understand
your connection to others,

409
00:26:38,684 --> 00:26:41,774
to everything around you,
to the people around you.

410
00:26:43,253 --> 00:26:47,606
And in doing this, maybe
you'll discover your passion.

411
00:26:48,781 --> 00:26:51,871
I want you to step
outside of the bubble

412
00:26:51,914 --> 00:26:54,613
you've lived in your whole life.

413
00:26:56,397 --> 00:26:58,486
So here's what
we're going to do.

414
00:26:58,529 --> 00:27:00,880
I'm gonna split you up
into groups of four.

415
00:27:00,923 --> 00:27:03,230
Okay, you can
choose, I don't care.

416
00:27:03,273 --> 00:27:04,666
You're going to meet
with each other.

417
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:07,234
You're going to ask
each other questions.

418
00:27:07,277 --> 00:27:08,191
You're going to get answers.

419
00:27:08,235 --> 00:27:09,802
You're gonna dig deep.

420
00:27:09,845 --> 00:27:10,933
Okay, you're gonna explore.

421
00:27:10,977 --> 00:27:11,934
You're gonna share ideas.

422
00:27:11,978 --> 00:27:13,806
You're gonna share emotions.

423
00:27:13,849 --> 00:27:15,155
You're gonna get
to know each other,

424
00:27:15,198 --> 00:27:17,418
get inside each other's head.

425
00:27:17,461 --> 00:27:19,638
And at the end of
the course I'm gonna

426
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:22,249
sit down with you, one on one,

427
00:27:22,292 --> 00:27:27,297
and we are going to go over
your 50 minimum page paper.

428
00:27:28,255 --> 00:27:29,343
No, don't groan.

429
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:33,347
By learning about each other
you'll learn about yourself.

430
00:27:35,436 --> 00:27:37,656
I'm going to analyze them,

431
00:27:37,699 --> 00:27:39,570
I'm going to ask
you some questions.

432
00:27:39,614 --> 00:27:43,009
I'm gonna score them
and the highest paper

433
00:27:44,227 --> 00:27:48,710
will receive a
check for $50,000.

434
00:27:52,322 --> 00:27:54,281
Does that make it
real enough for you?

435
00:27:54,324 --> 00:27:55,761
$50,000, okay?

436
00:27:55,804 --> 00:27:58,981
Yeah, but here's a warning,
okay, here's a warning.

437
00:27:59,025 --> 00:28:01,549
If you take this
lightly you'll fail.

438
00:28:02,768 --> 00:28:07,424
If you use Wiki searches
and Google, you'll fail.

439
00:28:08,643 --> 00:28:10,776
I want you to rely on
your group as a crutch.

440
00:28:10,819 --> 00:28:12,081
Okay?

441
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:15,258
I want you to reach to
them and to discover

442
00:28:15,302 --> 00:28:19,175
and explore ideas and emotions
you never could on your own,

443
00:28:19,219 --> 00:28:20,350
because I want you to remember

444
00:28:20,394 --> 00:28:22,091
something and this is important.

445
00:28:23,353 --> 00:28:27,749
A dream that you dream
alone is just a dream.

446
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:33,755
But a dream that you dream
together, that's reality.

447
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,672
Welcome to college.

448
00:28:54,602 --> 00:28:55,646
- Boston.

449
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:58,824
- Philly.

450
00:29:00,347 --> 00:29:03,132
What are you doing here?

451
00:29:03,176 --> 00:29:04,830
- I go here.

452
00:29:04,873 --> 00:29:06,483
- Were you in that class?

453
00:29:06,527 --> 00:29:08,572
Yes.

454
00:29:08,616 --> 00:29:10,923
- I didn't see you.

455
00:29:10,966 --> 00:29:11,750
- I was late.

456
00:29:12,838 --> 00:29:13,664
I saw you.

457
00:29:16,406 --> 00:29:18,669
- Okay, so you're
following me now?

458
00:29:20,889 --> 00:29:22,543
Your boyfriend okay with that?

459
00:29:24,066 --> 00:29:26,155
- Look, you don't know
what you're talking about,

460
00:29:26,199 --> 00:29:27,678
so let's just leave it at that.

461
00:29:27,722 --> 00:29:29,550
I just thought,
we need one more.

462
00:29:29,593 --> 00:29:33,423
- You thought you'd come
over here, bat your eyes,

463
00:29:33,467 --> 00:29:37,079
throw out a smile and
I'd do what you want?

464
00:29:37,123 --> 00:29:37,950
- Pretty much.

465
00:29:41,649 --> 00:29:43,999
- You need one, I need three.

466
00:29:45,653 --> 00:29:47,873
I guess I have no choice.

467
00:29:47,916 --> 00:29:48,743
- See?

468
00:29:49,875 --> 00:29:51,093
- What about me and you?

469
00:29:53,052 --> 00:29:56,795
- I mean, we met on a
random day, now we're in

470
00:29:56,838 --> 00:30:00,102
the same class with the
same crazy ass professor.

471
00:30:00,146 --> 00:30:01,451
Sometimes you just gotta admit

472
00:30:01,495 --> 00:30:03,018
things happen for
no reason at all.

473
00:30:04,628 --> 00:30:05,542
- Easier said than
done, I guess.

474
00:30:07,893 --> 00:30:09,633
What about him?

475
00:30:09,677 --> 00:30:10,591
Boyfriend?

476
00:30:10,634 --> 00:30:11,548
- That's G.

477
00:30:13,724 --> 00:30:14,682
- G?

478
00:30:14,725 --> 00:30:15,509
- G.

479
00:30:18,033 --> 00:30:18,991
- Who's our fourth?

480
00:30:24,648 --> 00:30:27,651
- So, how do you know him?

481
00:30:27,695 --> 00:30:29,305
- Long story.

482
00:30:29,349 --> 00:30:33,222
- Come on, drunken
hookup, baby daddy?

483
00:30:34,441 --> 00:30:36,660
I know there's something
sexual going on here.

484
00:30:36,704 --> 00:30:37,618
You're so out of pocket.

485
00:30:37,661 --> 00:30:38,662
- Out of pocket.

486
00:30:42,318 --> 00:30:43,058
- Whatever.

487
00:30:47,367 --> 00:30:49,108
- So what do you think, G?

488
00:30:49,151 --> 00:30:50,761
$50,000 dollars
is a lot of money.

489
00:30:52,024 --> 00:30:53,373
- Not split four ways.

490
00:30:54,765 --> 00:30:57,246
- Who said anything about
splitting it four ways?

491
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:58,117
- I know I didn't.

492
00:31:03,513 --> 00:31:05,428
So how do you know her?

493
00:31:06,212 --> 00:31:07,039
- Who, Philly?

494
00:31:07,082 --> 00:31:07,866
- Yeah.

495
00:31:10,042 --> 00:31:11,173
- Long story.

496
00:31:14,524 --> 00:31:17,310
What part of Philly you from?

497
00:31:17,353 --> 00:31:18,485
- Long story.

498
00:31:21,575 --> 00:31:22,793
Grab your stuff.

499
00:31:25,927 --> 00:31:27,320
- Oh, yes, okay.

500
00:31:30,453 --> 00:31:31,324
- Hey, guys.

501
00:31:31,367 --> 00:31:33,543
What's going on?

502
00:31:35,981 --> 00:31:36,764
- Okay.

503
00:31:38,026 --> 00:31:41,116
Okay, listen, we
don't have the luxury

504
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:44,163
of figuring out of this
is a good fit or not,

505
00:31:44,206 --> 00:31:46,905
so we're just gonna have to
make it compatible, okay?

506
00:31:47,862 --> 00:31:48,645
Alright?

507
00:31:48,689 --> 00:31:49,951
Right.

508
00:31:49,995 --> 00:31:52,998
- Okay, professor said
that we're gonna have to

509
00:31:53,041 --> 00:31:55,696
help each other if we
wanna pass this assignment.

510
00:31:55,739 --> 00:31:56,740
Alright?

511
00:31:58,307 --> 00:32:00,222
So we're just gonna have to
be honest with one another,

512
00:32:00,266 --> 00:32:01,571
so maybe we can
figure out what's

513
00:32:01,615 --> 00:32:04,574
going on in here and in here.

514
00:32:06,576 --> 00:32:07,664
Wow.

515
00:32:07,708 --> 00:32:09,318
- I know, alright.
- Okay.

516
00:32:09,362 --> 00:32:10,450
- So, it's simple.

517
00:32:11,625 --> 00:32:13,757
You pick a question
and you answer it.

518
00:32:13,801 --> 00:32:15,585
You don't get to lie.

519
00:32:15,629 --> 00:32:18,327
You just answer it and
you keep it moving.

520
00:32:18,371 --> 00:32:19,807
Alright?

521
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:21,809
- What if we don't feel like
answering the questions?

522
00:32:21,852 --> 00:32:23,332
- You answer 'em anyways.

523
00:32:24,594 --> 00:32:26,335
- Too street to
answer questions, G?

524
00:32:27,684 --> 00:32:30,600
- Okay, wait a minute, so
let me get this straight.

525
00:32:30,644 --> 00:32:32,385
You expect us to just answer any

526
00:32:32,428 --> 00:32:34,561
old question you put out there?

527
00:32:34,604 --> 00:32:35,779
Put our business
out there for some

528
00:32:35,823 --> 00:32:36,955
cash we don't even know is real?

529
00:32:36,998 --> 00:32:39,914
- You know, out of
everyone at this table,

530
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,437
I'd expect that from you.

531
00:32:41,481 --> 00:32:43,352
- And what the hell's
that supposed to mean?

532
00:32:43,396 --> 00:32:45,006
- Okay, what's going on here?

533
00:32:46,616 --> 00:32:47,400
- Ask Philly.

534
00:32:50,055 --> 00:32:51,273
- You know what?

535
00:32:51,317 --> 00:32:53,232
Yeah, I like this
game, so I'll go first.

536
00:32:55,538 --> 00:32:57,410
Why'd you come to
Philadelphia, Boston?

537
00:33:00,804 --> 00:33:01,849
- I don't know.

538
00:33:02,806 --> 00:33:03,764
I have one for you.

539
00:33:05,287 --> 00:33:07,681
When's the last time you cheated
on your boyfriend, Philly?

540
00:33:07,724 --> 00:33:08,508
- Ooh.

541
00:33:13,382 --> 00:33:14,209
- Okay.

542
00:33:17,256 --> 00:33:19,040
- Wait, I can't do this, guys.

543
00:33:23,349 --> 00:33:25,786
I am gonna be the sole reason
why you lose this thing.

544
00:33:29,398 --> 00:33:30,878
I'm sorry.

545
00:33:30,921 --> 00:33:31,705
- Hey, man!

546
00:33:32,575 --> 00:33:34,055
You think you're special?

547
00:33:34,099 --> 00:33:35,665
You're not!

548
00:33:35,709 --> 00:33:36,927
We all have issues.

549
00:33:36,971 --> 00:33:39,713
This is why we're
here, to figure it out.

550
00:33:40,714 --> 00:33:41,454
Together.

551
00:33:46,676 --> 00:33:47,590
- Together.

552
00:33:51,725 --> 00:33:53,727
- Okay, everyone just
have a seat, okay?

553
00:34:00,821 --> 00:34:02,779
Here, pick your question.

554
00:34:02,823 --> 00:34:04,216
- I'm first?

555
00:34:04,259 --> 00:34:05,043
- Yep.

556
00:34:09,873 --> 00:34:13,007
- If you could choose the
sex and physical appearance

557
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:16,793
of your soon-to-be
child, would you do it?

558
00:34:19,883 --> 00:34:20,710
I answer, too?

559
00:34:21,494 --> 00:34:22,712
That's the point,

560
00:34:22,756 --> 00:34:24,888
you answer 'em and
you keep it moving.

561
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,283
- I would not.

562
00:34:29,937 --> 00:34:31,156
But I'd be hoping for a guy.

563
00:34:32,592 --> 00:34:33,375
- Of course.

564
00:34:37,553 --> 00:34:40,600
- What do you constitute
for a perfect day?

565
00:34:41,818 --> 00:34:43,081
- Aww.

566
00:34:43,124 --> 00:34:46,693
- I would say just
hangin' around

567
00:34:46,736 --> 00:34:50,131
people that actually
care about me.

568
00:34:50,175 --> 00:34:51,001
Okay?

569
00:34:52,351 --> 00:34:53,352
- Very nice.

570
00:34:55,441 --> 00:35:00,141
- Okay, so, if you
could have anyone as

571
00:35:00,185 --> 00:35:03,840
your guest who would you
want as a dinner guest?

572
00:35:03,884 --> 00:35:04,928
Oh my, God.

573
00:35:07,409 --> 00:35:08,454
Well, I don't know.

574
00:35:09,585 --> 00:35:11,457
I guess I need a
lot of laughter,

575
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:16,157
I think, these days, so
I'm gonna say Kevin Hart.

576
00:35:16,201 --> 00:35:17,027
- Okay.

577
00:35:18,028 --> 00:35:19,029
A dude from Philly?

578
00:35:19,073 --> 00:35:19,900
- Exactly.

579
00:35:21,945 --> 00:35:25,123
- Alright, what is the
worst memory that you have?

580
00:35:48,233 --> 00:35:49,016
So,

581
00:35:51,061 --> 00:35:51,888
I,

582
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:55,196
I am a cutter.

583
00:35:56,937 --> 00:35:58,721
- What?

584
00:35:58,765 --> 00:35:59,809
- Um,

585
00:36:00,636 --> 00:36:02,551
I don't like to tell people,

586
00:36:02,595 --> 00:36:05,337
but it's something that
I struggle with and...

587
00:36:09,863 --> 00:36:12,866
I started doing it in
high school and it gets

588
00:36:12,909 --> 00:36:16,565
worse sometimes and then
other times I'm okay.

589
00:36:20,003 --> 00:36:21,222
- Why?

590
00:36:21,266 --> 00:36:22,615
Why do you cut?

591
00:36:26,227 --> 00:36:29,622
- They say it's to help

592
00:36:31,101 --> 00:36:36,106
me physically feel things
that emotionally hurt me.

593
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:41,242
It's a way for me to feel the
pain and let it be released.

594
00:36:42,896 --> 00:36:44,724
And I don't expect
anybody to understand it

595
00:36:44,767 --> 00:36:47,205
and I can't even
explain it that well.

596
00:36:48,728 --> 00:36:50,077
But it's something that people

597
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,035
struggle with and
that I struggle with.

598
00:36:55,038 --> 00:36:57,127
So, that's how you're
honest and that's how

599
00:36:57,171 --> 00:36:59,956
you answer the questions
and you keep it moving.

600
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,393
Alright, your turn.

601
00:37:03,177 --> 00:37:04,570
- Okay, Rye Rye.

602
00:37:06,963 --> 00:37:11,229
What would you do with the
$50,000 dollars if you won?

603
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,973
There is no money, I don't
care what you guys say.

604
00:37:17,017 --> 00:37:19,106
This guy's not givin' the loot.

605
00:37:19,149 --> 00:37:20,629
- Can't you be positive?

606
00:37:22,109 --> 00:37:25,678
- Alright, I'd buy two
cars, one for me, one for G.

607
00:37:26,592 --> 00:37:27,549
- Yes, sir.

608
00:37:29,725 --> 00:37:31,988
Well, we'll
just stay walking, I guess.

609
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:34,252
I mean, we see you
guys.

610
00:37:34,295 --> 00:37:35,601
You got gas money?

611
00:37:35,644 --> 00:37:39,169
- It's not cheap, it's
not cheap in Philly.

612
00:38:24,606 --> 00:38:28,088
- Listen, we came
from the bottom.

613
00:38:29,394 --> 00:38:31,004
This is all we know.

614
00:38:32,397 --> 00:38:33,223
Look around.

615
00:38:35,138 --> 00:38:38,098
You know we can't pull stuff
in our neighborhood like this.

616
00:38:39,099 --> 00:38:40,492
The boys in our hood?

617
00:38:42,407 --> 00:38:44,322
They are tryin' to
rob us and kill us.

618
00:38:45,888 --> 00:38:47,368
Yo, why you think I got to SUNY?

619
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:51,372
Sometimes you gotta fit
in just to make it out.

620
00:38:53,592 --> 00:38:57,247
I got this so they
don't spot me, yo.

621
00:39:02,165 --> 00:39:04,037
You feelin' me?

622
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,212
- I feel you.

623
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:45,513
- What's goin' on, Philly?

624
00:39:45,557 --> 00:39:46,949
How you been?

625
00:39:46,993 --> 00:39:49,082
- You'd know if you
came to our meetings.

626
00:39:50,344 --> 00:39:52,781
- I have things on my
mind, other classes.

627
00:39:53,913 --> 00:39:56,394
- So, these classes offer 50K?

628
00:39:59,092 --> 00:40:03,792
- Philly, please,
professors don't give money.

629
00:40:03,836 --> 00:40:06,099
They give homework,
they give headaches.

630
00:40:07,013 --> 00:40:08,580
- You give headaches.

631
00:40:08,623 --> 00:40:10,451
That's good.

632
00:40:12,235 --> 00:40:13,106
What are you studying?

633
00:40:14,499 --> 00:40:16,849
- You ain't in the class.

634
00:40:16,892 --> 00:40:19,242
- I'm a pretty smart guy,
I could help you out.

635
00:40:31,603 --> 00:40:33,169
What we got here?

636
00:40:35,128 --> 00:40:36,912
- I think somebody
thinks he's slick.

637
00:40:39,306 --> 00:40:40,307
- You got me.

638
00:40:42,396 --> 00:40:45,268
- Funny, I think I can count
how times I've seen you smile.

639
00:40:48,663 --> 00:40:50,186
- Some people just don't smile.

640
00:40:51,666 --> 00:40:54,190
- I don't believe that.

641
00:40:54,234 --> 00:40:56,454
I think something's
keeping you from smiling.

642
00:40:59,282 --> 00:41:00,283
- Yeah, maybe.

643
00:41:02,503 --> 00:41:06,899
- Well, trust me, you're not
gonna win the fight alone.

644
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:12,426
And I gotta go.

645
00:41:14,733 --> 00:41:16,212
- I just got here.

646
00:41:16,256 --> 00:41:17,344
- I've been here.

647
00:41:22,175 --> 00:41:23,263
Excuse you.

648
00:41:29,312 --> 00:41:30,357
Bye.

649
00:41:54,337 --> 00:41:57,645
- I've been to too
many of these things.

650
00:41:57,689 --> 00:41:59,212
It never seems to get easier.

651
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:01,693
They never seem to
end fast enough.

652
00:42:03,303 --> 00:42:05,566
- Sorry it couldn't end
fast enough for you.

653
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:07,525
- You know what I mean.

654
00:42:07,568 --> 00:42:08,351
- Yeah.

655
00:42:11,311 --> 00:42:13,574
- Look, I brought
you the game ball,

656
00:42:13,618 --> 00:42:14,836
thought you might want it.

657
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,316
- Yo, put that in
the trash, man.

658
00:42:18,231 --> 00:42:20,625
- You know, they told me
that you got nasty now.

659
00:42:20,668 --> 00:42:22,844
Said you were a
'ticking time bomb'.

660
00:42:24,106 --> 00:42:25,586
I don't believe 'em.

661
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:26,456
I still don't.

662
00:42:28,458 --> 00:42:29,764
- What do you want, Coach?

663
00:42:29,808 --> 00:42:31,766
- I just came by to help out.

664
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:33,899
Help out any way I could.

665
00:42:33,942 --> 00:42:35,204
- By bringing me a ball?

666
00:42:36,379 --> 00:42:39,426
- Listen Rome, I don't
have any children.

667
00:42:39,469 --> 00:42:42,168
I got the team and I got a ball.

668
00:42:43,386 --> 00:42:45,563
I coach because that's
all I ever wanted to do.

669
00:42:47,434 --> 00:42:48,914
- Save me the speech, Coach.

670
00:42:49,741 --> 00:42:50,829
I just wanna be alone.

671
00:42:53,048 --> 00:42:55,573
- Listen, you don't
have to be like this.

672
00:42:57,705 --> 00:43:00,578
It's okay to just be
a kid, to let it go.

673
00:43:01,666 --> 00:43:02,884
It's okay to cry.

674
00:43:06,671 --> 00:43:07,497
- You done?

675
00:43:09,325 --> 00:43:10,152
- Yeah, I'm done.

676
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:14,504
Just keep it.

677
00:43:40,095 --> 00:43:41,531
Philly!

678
00:43:42,576 --> 00:43:43,664
- What?

679
00:43:43,708 --> 00:43:44,796
- Philly, hold on.

680
00:43:46,014 --> 00:43:47,537
- Why are you always
running behind me?

681
00:43:47,581 --> 00:43:49,496
You need to find
yourself a girl.

682
00:43:49,539 --> 00:43:50,802
- I got myself a girl.

683
00:43:51,759 --> 00:43:53,500
She's just stubborn.

684
00:43:53,543 --> 00:43:54,327
- Is that so?

685
00:43:55,458 --> 00:43:57,069
- Let me take you out.

686
00:43:57,112 --> 00:43:59,506
- No, that is not a good idea.

687
00:43:59,549 --> 00:44:00,463
- It's a great idea.

688
00:44:01,682 --> 00:44:04,642
Get something to eat,
go to the movies.

689
00:44:06,034 --> 00:44:07,601
Sneak in some liquor.

690
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:08,820
We just have fun.

691
00:44:08,863 --> 00:44:11,649
- Listen, I told
you, I'm spoken for.

692
00:44:14,739 --> 00:44:16,262
- I'm not trying to make you do

693
00:44:16,305 --> 00:44:17,698
something you don't wanna do.

694
00:44:17,742 --> 00:44:20,309
I just want to get
to know you more.

695
00:44:20,353 --> 00:44:23,182
I wanna know the chick
that I met on the train.

696
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,924
The one that forces me to laugh

697
00:44:25,967 --> 00:44:27,490
when I don't even want to smile.

698
00:44:29,536 --> 00:44:30,406
The one that I kissed.

699
00:44:34,889 --> 00:44:36,325
- Look, I'm not
saying that I don't

700
00:44:36,369 --> 00:44:38,327
think about the
first time we met.

701
00:44:38,371 --> 00:44:42,114
I mean, you came outta
nowhere and it was great,

702
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:46,379
but I have someone
and he knows me.

703
00:44:47,597 --> 00:44:49,164
He's known me for
a really long time.

704
00:44:51,036 --> 00:44:53,429
Me and you, we had
the perfect day.

705
00:44:54,866 --> 00:44:56,432
Why can't we just
leave it at that?

706
00:44:57,782 --> 00:45:00,567

know anything about me.

I don't have a
white picket fence.

I don't even know what that is.

The only one that knows me

966
00:58:14,578 --> 00:58:16,231
is a stranger now.

967
00:58:19,539 --> 00:58:20,627

968
00:58:22,586 --> 00:58:24,413
And I'm right here.

969
00:58:26,285 --> 00:58:28,505
And every time I try to get to
know you better you run away.

970
00:58:29,810 --> 00:58:31,290
Then you become a stranger.

971

00:58:39,254 --> 00:58:41,387
I know what you're all saying
about the white picket fence.

973
00:58:42,693 --> 00:58:44,042
But I had that.

974
00:58:45,609 --> 00:58:50,614
I had all that and it didn't
protect me from hurt, or harm.

975
00:58:53,312 --> 00:58:55,488
You know, and I told
you guys the only thing

976
00:58:55,532 --> 00:59:00,362
that got me out of a hard
place was a friendship.

977
00:59:01,625 --> 00:59:04,410
And here we are, we've known
each other all semester,

978
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,369
but we still don't
really know each other.

979
00:59:10,721 --> 00:59:12,592
And we're trying to win
that $50,000 dollars,

980
00:59:12,636 --> 00:59:14,507
but how are we gonna
get it like this?

981
00:59:20,469 --> 00:59:24,430
You know, and even if
that money isn't real,

982
00:59:25,736 --> 00:59:27,738
don't you want
something to believe in?

983
00:59:29,653 --> 00:59:31,132
Or something to connect us?

984
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:43,623

No, I don't like that,
I don't like that.

1076
01:07:04,759 --> 01:07:07,849
Caroline, will you marry me?

1077
01:07:29,523 --> 01:07:30,655
What's wrong with you?

1078
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:36,574
I thought this was
what we always wanted?

1079
01:07:36,617 --> 01:07:38,271
- This is what
you always wanted.

1080
01:07:39,229 --> 01:07:40,926
- So you don't love me anymore?

1081
01:07:42,275 --> 01:07:44,408
- Of course, I
love you, I just...

1082
01:07:46,236 --> 01:07:47,541
- So why would you
embarrass me like

1083
01:07:47,585 --> 01:07:49,500
that in front of my
family and friends?

1084
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:53,547
- I don't know, baby I'm sorry,

1085
01:07:53,591 --> 01:07:55,375
something just
doesn't feel right.

1086
01:07:55,419 --> 01:07:56,768
I'm sorry!

1087
01:07:59,988 --> 01:08:01,990
- Look, I'm sorry, okay?

1088
01:08:03,427 --> 01:08:04,950
I'm not trying to
pressure you to

1089
01:08:04,993 --> 01:08:06,647
do anything you don't wanna do.

1090
01:08:08,736 --> 01:08:10,303
I just wanna talk
to you, please.

1091
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:17,310
We've been loving each
other for a long time, okay?

1092
01:08:17,354 --> 01:08:20,139
So if this is not the
right time, I understand.

1093
01:08:20,183 --> 01:08:21,358
- I'm sure.

1094
01:08:21,401 --> 01:08:23,403
- Come on, man, get out
the car, I love you.

1095
01:08:23,447 --> 01:08:24,839
Let me get a hug or something.

1096
01:08:27,146 --> 01:08:27,929
- Alright.

1097
01:08:29,148 --> 01:08:29,931
I'll come out.

1098
01:08:34,936 --> 01:08:39,071
No!

1099
01:08:57,394 --> 01:08:58,699
Mr.
Mayor, Mr. Mayor!

1100
01:08:58,743 --> 01:09:00,005
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1101
01:09:00,048 --> 01:09:01,049
Listen, I'd just like
to make the statement

1102
01:09:01,093 --> 01:09:02,790
that I'm both
honored and humbled

1103
01:09:02,834 --> 01:09:05,184
to serve our great
city as its 58th mayor.

1104
01:09:05,228 --> 01:09:06,968
- Mr. Mayor, according to--
- And I look forward to

1105
01:09:07,012 --> 01:09:08,753
- Reliable sources.
- Putting my plan into action

1106
01:09:08,796 --> 01:09:10,885
that my staff has
started to improve

1107
01:09:10,929 --> 01:09:13,845
the education systems of
the city of Philadelphia.

1108
01:09:13,888 --> 01:09:15,151
Thank you very much.

1109
01:09:15,194 --> 01:09:17,196
- Mr. Mayor, according
to a reliable resource,

1110
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:19,198
the students are being
kept from speaking up

1111
01:09:19,242 --> 01:09:20,982
about the conditions
in the school.

1112
01:09:21,026 --> 01:09:22,070
- That's simply just not true.

1113
01:09:22,114 --> 01:09:23,550
- Mr. Mayor, there
are many people

1114
01:09:23,594 --> 01:09:25,422
who believe you haven't
taken a strong enough

1115
01:09:25,465 --> 01:09:28,076
stance against the obvious
growth of gentrification

1116
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:30,209
in popular black
communities in Philadelphia.

1117
01:09:30,253 --> 01:09:31,079
Would you like to comment?

1118
01:09:31,123 --> 01:09:32,603
- You know what?

1119
01:09:32,646 --> 01:09:33,908
Let's grant him the
opportunity to an official

1120
01:09:33,952 --> 01:09:35,954
press conference before
we further question.

1121
01:09:35,997 --> 01:09:38,957
- Mr. Mayor, what about
the school closings?

1122
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,699
- We've closed some certain
underperforming schools,

1123
01:09:41,742 --> 01:09:43,135
but we're gonna
reopen new schools

1124
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:44,223
that are gonna be
better for our students.

1125
01:09:44,267 --> 01:09:45,964
- You mean the black schools?

1126
01:09:46,007 --> 01:09:47,139
You're on record
stating that the

1127
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:49,663
Black Lives Matter
movement is volatile

1128
01:09:49,707 --> 01:09:50,969
and nothing more than
a social media fad.

1129
01:09:51,012 --> 01:09:52,579
- We'll make an official
statement when our staff

1130
01:09:52,623 --> 01:09:53,885
has looked at the
issues and we're

1131
01:09:53,928 --> 01:09:55,408
ready to talk about
it, thank you.

1132
01:09:55,452 --> 01:09:56,322
Mr.
Mayor, Mr. Mayor!

1133
01:09:56,366 --> 01:09:58,455
- No more questions, back up!

1134
01:09:58,498 --> 01:09:59,282
- Bullshit!

1135
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:01,719
- I'm so sorry, Mr. Mayor.

1136
01:10:01,762 --> 01:10:02,981
- You heard him!
- What did you say?

1137
01:10:03,024 --> 01:10:04,635
- He said bullshit!

1138
01:10:04,678 --> 01:10:05,940
- Philadelphia has
one of the lowest

1139
01:10:05,984 --> 01:10:08,247
educational funding
in the United States!

1140
01:10:08,291 --> 01:10:09,988
You sound like you're
doing a good job,

1141
01:10:10,031 --> 01:10:11,381
the whole time people are
here looking dumb as hell!

1142
01:10:11,424 --> 01:10:12,643
- Now, hold on there.

1143
01:10:12,686 --> 01:10:14,297
- I guess that Philly,
is even investing

1144
01:10:14,340 --> 01:10:16,255
in our children's
educational future?

1145
01:10:16,299 --> 01:10:18,388
Or making sure the
rich dicks stay rich?

1146
01:10:18,431 --> 01:10:20,085
Our kids get screwed over!

1147
01:10:20,128 --> 01:10:22,261
- Do you have any
comment, Mr. Mayor?

1148
01:10:22,305 --> 01:10:23,915
- Ya'll tax and
spend corporations,

1149
01:10:23,958 --> 01:10:25,482
meanwhile you cut over a billion

1150
01:10:25,525 --> 01:10:28,267
dollars for education statewide!

1151
01:10:28,311 --> 01:10:30,138
- I know 10 schools
that closed down!

1152
01:10:30,182 --> 01:10:31,401
Teachers fired!

1153
01:10:31,444 --> 01:10:33,664
We don't have no school
counselors, nurses!

1154
01:10:33,707 --> 01:10:35,970
Shit, we don't even got paper!

1155
01:10:36,014 --> 01:10:38,321
- I think you guys just
need to chill out, alright?

1156
01:10:38,364 --> 01:10:39,322
- Don't do that!

1157
01:10:39,365 --> 01:10:40,671
Don't patronize me!

1158
01:10:40,714 --> 01:10:42,977
Or say some relatable
bullshit like chill out.

1159
01:10:43,021 --> 01:10:44,544
- You can never be relatable!

1160
01:10:44,588 --> 01:10:46,024
Because your shoes too clean
- Push him back.

1161
01:10:46,067 --> 01:10:48,026
- And your hair's too clean!
- Push him back.

1162
01:10:49,288 --> 01:10:50,550
- No, no, no, I don't
need no applause!

1163
01:10:50,594 --> 01:10:52,770
This doesn't
deserve no applause!

1164
01:10:52,813 --> 01:10:55,120
I just call bullshit
when I see it!

1165
01:10:55,163 --> 01:10:56,077
And we tired of it!

1166
01:10:57,340 --> 01:10:58,993
- Do you have any
comment, Mr. Mayor?

1167
01:11:05,043 --> 01:11:06,871
Would you like to
comment, Mr. Mayor?

1168
01:11:28,022 --> 01:11:29,110
Don't say a word!

1169
01:11:29,154 --> 01:11:31,025
Alright, let's
go, we're good!

1170
01:11:31,069 --> 01:11:33,114
No, we ain't good yet!

1171
01:11:33,158 --> 01:11:34,028
What?

1172
01:11:34,072 --> 01:11:35,116
I got you into this?

1173
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:36,683
How you gonna pay
for college, G?

1174
01:11:37,902 --> 01:11:39,425
How you gonna pay
for your books?

1175
01:11:39,469 --> 01:11:41,079
After this shit, I'm done!

1176
01:11:41,122 --> 01:11:42,472
Did you
forget you wanna go to

1177
01:11:42,515 --> 01:11:44,082
that white-ass
school and leave me?

1178
01:11:44,125 --> 01:11:45,823
You fake-ass nigga!

1179
01:12:07,845 --> 01:12:08,628
- Move!

1180
01:12:09,499 --> 01:12:10,935
Get out the way!

1181
01:12:13,198 --> 01:12:13,981
Come on!

1182
01:12:16,767 --> 01:12:17,550
Come on!

1183
01:12:20,118 --> 01:12:20,901
Come on!

1184
01:12:30,433 --> 01:12:31,216
Come on!

1185
01:12:37,788 --> 01:12:39,006
Come on!

1186
01:12:39,050 --> 01:12:40,225
Get out the way!

1187
01:12:43,097 --> 01:12:44,360
Come on!

1188
01:12:44,403 --> 01:12:46,057
Stay with me, man, come on!

1189
01:12:46,100 --> 01:12:48,233
I'm right here with
you, I got you!

1190
01:12:51,149 --> 01:12:52,933
Come on, let's move!

1191
01:13:44,332 --> 01:13:45,856
We got some things
to do when I get my--

1192
01:13:45,899 --> 01:13:49,120
- He say in eight months to
a year he gonna be finished--

1193
01:13:53,298 --> 01:13:55,300
I'm just, I'm just,

1194
01:13:55,343 --> 01:13:57,781
when you runnin'
down the highway.

1195
01:13:57,824 --> 01:13:58,738
When you runnin'
down the highway

1196
01:13:58,782 --> 01:13:59,957
you gonna run into traffic.

1197
01:14:05,136 --> 01:14:07,747
- Does anyone know where
I can find Carolina?

1198
01:14:07,791 --> 01:14:08,574
What?

1199
01:14:10,228 --> 01:14:11,316
- Who's asking?

1200
01:14:12,709 --> 01:14:15,886
- I'm a, I'm Rome.

1201
01:14:15,929 --> 01:14:18,584
She calls me Boston
you've probably heard.

1202
01:14:18,628 --> 01:14:20,151
- Boston?

1203
01:14:20,194 --> 01:14:22,327
- No, she ain't never
mentioned no Boston, homie.

1204
01:14:22,370 --> 01:14:24,155
I don't know about that.

1205
01:14:24,198 --> 01:14:27,288
- Are you guys her family,

1206
01:14:27,332 --> 01:14:28,986
like, are you her
dad or something?

1207
01:14:31,336 --> 01:14:34,034
- Carolina, she
ain't got no family.

1208
01:14:34,078 --> 01:14:35,340
She adopted.

1209
01:14:35,383 --> 01:14:36,994
She ain't mention that to you?

1210
01:14:38,125 --> 01:14:39,387
Look at his face.

1211
01:14:39,431 --> 01:14:41,041
- No, she didn't mention that.

1212
01:14:42,956 --> 01:14:43,740
Is she here?

1213
01:14:47,047 --> 01:14:47,918
Whoa.

1214
01:14:47,961 --> 01:14:48,658
- See us Philly guys, right?

1215
01:14:50,703 --> 01:14:52,662
We got a natural
chip on our shoulder.

1216
01:14:52,705 --> 01:14:54,620
We don't like nobody
from nowhere else.

1217
01:14:54,664 --> 01:14:55,882
You follow what I'm saying?

1218
01:14:55,926 --> 01:14:57,275
We come from the mud.

1219
01:14:58,798 --> 01:15:01,714
See, we was factory workers,
grinding metal and stuff.

1220
01:15:02,976 --> 01:15:04,935
And when they all shut
down we had it rough.

1221
01:15:06,371 --> 01:15:08,634
So we had to get rough.

1222
01:15:08,678 --> 01:15:09,983
You know what I'm saying?

1223
01:15:10,027 --> 01:15:11,507
See, you from Boston man.

1224
01:15:12,812 --> 01:15:15,075
What, you was born
with a silver spoon.

1225
01:15:15,119 --> 01:15:17,774
Y'all got molasses and
chowder and stuff like that.

1226
01:15:19,776 --> 01:15:21,342
You ain't no Philly boy, aki.

1227
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:24,345
See, we might got
the same color skin,

1228
01:15:25,433 --> 01:15:27,305
but we different on the inside.

1229
01:15:28,175 --> 01:15:29,394
We wolves, man.

1230
01:15:30,830 --> 01:15:33,354
You ain't gonna find no
brotherly love up in here.

1231
01:15:33,398 --> 01:15:34,268
You hear me?

1232
01:15:34,312 --> 01:15:37,881
And Carolina, she's spoken for.

1233
01:15:37,924 --> 01:15:39,622
She property of.

1234
01:15:39,665 --> 01:15:41,362
Etched on her biker jacket.

1235
01:15:41,406 --> 01:15:43,016
Forget about her, you hear me?

1236
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:45,279
Boston!

1237
01:15:45,323 --> 01:15:46,890
- Philly, who are these people?

1238
01:15:46,933 --> 01:15:48,282
What
are you doing here?

1239
01:15:48,326 --> 01:15:49,196
You've gotta go.

1240
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:50,284
I came looking for you.

1241
01:15:50,328 --> 01:15:52,373
- Nah, he ain't going nowhere.

1242
01:15:52,417 --> 01:15:54,158
And Philly you asking
for a death wish

1243
01:15:54,201 --> 01:15:56,029
bringing this Boston boy to
the heart of north Philly.

1244
01:15:56,073 --> 01:15:57,204
What's wrong with you?
- Stop it!

1245
01:15:57,248 --> 01:15:58,597
He's leaving, okay?

1246
01:15:58,641 --> 01:16:00,251
- Yo, he ain't like us.

1247
01:16:00,294 --> 01:16:01,600
Look at him.

1248
01:16:01,644 --> 01:16:03,950
He ain't got that
fire in his eyes.

1249
01:16:03,994 --> 01:16:05,343
Shit, look how he dress.

1250
01:16:07,998 --> 01:16:10,566
- Please go, I'll explain later.

1251
01:16:11,436 --> 01:16:12,611
Just go.

1252
01:16:12,655 --> 01:16:13,264
You never told
me you were adopted.

1253
01:16:14,134 --> 01:16:16,310
- Just leave, he's leaving.

1254
01:16:16,354 --> 01:16:18,530
- No, he ain't
going nowhere yet.

1255
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:21,620
We ain't even introduced
each other yet.

1256
01:16:21,664 --> 01:16:22,839
See, I'm Big Papa.

1257
01:16:24,144 --> 01:16:27,191
My brother upstairs,
that's her fiance.

1258
01:16:29,323 --> 01:16:30,281
- Yeah.

1259
01:16:30,324 --> 01:16:32,239
You're married?

1260
01:16:32,283 --> 01:16:33,632
- Oh, you ain't tell him?

1261
01:16:35,503 --> 01:16:36,330
Tell him.

1262
01:16:36,374 --> 01:16:37,593
Tell college boy.

1263
01:16:38,811 --> 01:16:40,987
Tell him how you left
my brother paralyzed!

1264
01:16:42,119 --> 01:16:43,990
And you ran out on him!

1265
01:16:44,034 --> 01:16:46,079
How he proposed to
you and loved you

1266
01:16:46,123 --> 01:16:47,907
and you left him
after eight years!

1267
01:16:49,387 --> 01:16:52,825
Now he a damn retard!

1268
01:16:52,869 --> 01:16:53,652
- Philly!

1269
01:16:58,439 --> 01:16:59,832
- Big P, please!

1270
01:17:01,442 --> 01:17:04,358
- You need to make
a decision, man!

1271
01:17:05,577 --> 01:17:07,753
Hey yo, man, take
Boston out the back.

1272
01:17:07,797 --> 01:17:11,148
- Oh, Mr. Boston,
don't go showing

1273
01:17:11,191 --> 01:17:13,193
your face around here no more.

1274
01:17:13,237 --> 01:17:14,455
If you do, we're
running you for all

1275
01:17:14,499 --> 01:17:17,284
your baked beans and
your Boston Tea Party!

1276
01:17:17,328 --> 01:17:19,286
Get the hell outta here, homie!

1277
01:17:20,853 --> 01:17:21,811
- Boston, wait!

1278
01:17:22,725 --> 01:17:23,943
Please, wait!

1279
01:17:23,987 --> 01:17:25,292
- What, Philly?

1280
01:17:25,336 --> 01:17:26,685
- Listen to me!
- We're done!

1281
01:17:26,729 --> 01:17:27,468
- Don't say that!

1282
01:17:27,512 --> 01:17:28,774
- We are done!

1283
01:17:28,818 --> 01:17:30,515
- That's not fair!

1284
01:17:30,558 --> 01:17:31,647
You don't understand!

1285
01:17:31,690 --> 01:17:33,387
He almost died right
in front of me!

1286
01:17:33,431 --> 01:17:34,693
How do you want me to walk away?

1287
01:17:34,737 --> 01:17:36,086
- Almost died?

1288
01:17:36,129 --> 01:17:38,044
- I can't just abandon him!
- Almost died?

1289
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:40,656
My parents did die!

1290
01:17:41,961 --> 01:17:44,007
To come watch me play
some bullshit game!

1291
01:17:46,009 --> 01:17:47,401
Life's not fair!

1292
01:17:47,445 --> 01:17:49,012
Shit happens!

1293
01:17:49,055 --> 01:17:50,448
- Why wouldn't you tell me that?

1294
01:17:50,491 --> 01:17:52,015
- Tell you what?

1295
01:17:52,058 --> 01:17:53,320
That I shouldn't be here?

1296
01:17:53,364 --> 01:17:54,582
That I should be home?

1297
01:17:54,626 --> 01:17:55,975
Did you tell me about him?

1298
01:17:57,150 --> 01:17:58,412
Exactly!

1299
01:17:58,456 --> 01:18:00,414
- We can talk about it now!
- No!

1300
01:19:56,269 --> 01:19:57,053
- Stay here.

1301
01:20:12,677 --> 01:20:15,462
Welcome to your new
living arrangement.

1302
01:20:15,506 --> 01:20:17,334
- Are you serious?

1303
01:20:17,377 --> 01:20:19,336
- This isn't a joke, Rome!

1304
01:20:19,379 --> 01:20:20,728
This is your life!

1305
01:20:22,295 --> 01:20:24,907
If they press charges then
you're kicked out of college!

1306
01:20:26,647 --> 01:20:27,910
- I'm sorry.

1307
01:20:27,953 --> 01:20:29,955
- This isn't about
being sorry, Rome!

1308
01:20:29,999 --> 01:20:31,870
This is about
helping me help you.

1309
01:20:35,439 --> 01:20:36,309
Speak to me!

1310
01:20:49,235 --> 01:20:51,629
Just talk to me, Rome.

1311
01:20:55,502 --> 01:20:56,808
- What do you want me to say?

1312
01:21:00,377 --> 01:21:02,596
I told them everything.

1313
01:21:05,469 --> 01:21:08,689
I told them my
secrets, my dreams.

1314
01:21:10,648 --> 01:21:13,520
I told them everything, alright?

1315
01:21:13,564 --> 01:21:14,608
You lost a friend.

1316
01:21:15,566 --> 01:21:18,351
I lost my mom and my dad!

1317
01:21:20,658 --> 01:21:21,702
I can't get over that!

1318
01:21:24,923 --> 01:21:26,533
I can never get over that!

1319
01:21:28,796 --> 01:21:29,972
- It's nothing to get over.

1320
01:21:31,756 --> 01:21:32,626
It's life.

1321
01:21:35,934 --> 01:21:36,935
There's no blueprint.

1322
01:21:36,979 --> 01:21:39,895
I mean, we wake up, we live.

1323
01:21:41,853 --> 01:21:43,028
We go to sleep and

1324
01:21:46,031 --> 01:21:50,775
somewhere, somehow,
amazing things happen.

1325
01:21:56,172 --> 01:21:59,915
Hopefully, we fall in love
and then everything changes.

1326
01:22:01,481 --> 01:22:02,613
But you can't describe it.

1327
01:22:05,311 --> 01:22:08,532
And you can't talk about
it and you just feel it.

1328
01:22:12,014 --> 01:22:12,884
I loved your mom.

1329
01:22:15,191 --> 01:22:15,974
And I love you.

1330
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:23,721
You don't have to get over
it, no one's telling you to.

1331
01:22:26,028 --> 01:22:26,898
You can cry.

1332
01:22:26,942 --> 01:22:29,031
You don't have to be tough.

1333
01:22:29,074 --> 01:22:30,249
You don't have to run.

1334
01:22:31,729 --> 01:22:32,773
You don't...

1335
01:22:34,862 --> 01:22:36,255
You can be a kid.

1336
01:22:45,134 --> 01:22:47,875
- You don't have
to be like this.

1337
01:22:47,919 --> 01:22:51,488
It's okay to just be
a kid, to let it go.

1338
01:22:52,489 --> 01:22:53,577
It's okay to cry.

1339
01:22:57,450 --> 01:23:00,018
- You done?

1340
01:23:00,062 --> 01:23:00,801
- Yeah, I'm done.

1341
01:23:18,210 --> 01:23:18,994
- Yo,

1342
01:23:21,257 --> 01:23:22,040
I draw.

1343
01:23:23,302 --> 01:23:25,435
I mean, we only went in
that house for money.

1344
01:23:26,827 --> 01:23:28,568
That's all we went in there for.

1345
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:32,746
I didn't know the girl
was gonna be in there.

1346
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:36,185
I mean, I didn't even know
she was gonna wake up.

1347
01:23:39,971 --> 01:23:42,582
And when she did, I
just got so angry.

1348
01:23:45,933 --> 01:23:48,066
She represented
everything that we wanted.

1349
01:23:49,546 --> 01:23:53,332
Parents down the hallway,
a big house, money.

1350
01:23:55,856 --> 01:23:56,857
Innocence.

1351
01:23:58,772 --> 01:24:00,818
You know, that's a luxury
where we come from.

1352
01:24:06,389 --> 01:24:08,695
I mean, I know I messed up.

1353
01:24:13,570 --> 01:24:14,962
- Yeah, it's okay.

1354
01:24:18,836 --> 01:24:19,880
I know.

1355
01:24:21,099 --> 01:24:23,014
Life tends to bring the
worst out in people.

1356
01:24:26,365 --> 01:24:29,542
And that shame and
regret you're feeling?

1357
01:24:31,153 --> 01:24:32,458
That just shows you care.

1358
01:24:37,942 --> 01:24:40,727
Man, I know you my whole life.

1359
01:24:40,771 --> 01:24:42,773
I know you like the
back of my hand.

1360
01:24:44,035 --> 01:24:45,471
I'm telling you it's okay.

1361
01:24:49,823 --> 01:24:50,868
Thanks.

1362
01:24:52,304 --> 01:24:53,479
Guess I was all that.

1363
01:24:56,917 --> 01:24:58,876
- This whole college
life is new to me.

1364
01:25:00,573 --> 01:25:03,054
Especially that $50,000.

1365
01:25:03,098 --> 01:25:03,837
- 50K?

1366
01:25:03,881 --> 01:25:05,187
Yeah, man.

1367
01:25:05,230 --> 01:25:06,971
- That's some bread.

1368
01:25:07,014 --> 01:25:08,973
You think it's real?

1369
01:25:09,016 --> 01:25:11,018
- Gotta be real,
you in college now.

1370
01:25:11,802 --> 01:25:12,803
- Yeah, that's true.

1371
01:25:14,805 --> 01:25:15,849
Besides the 50K,

1372
01:25:19,026 --> 01:25:20,593
I met a few people
along the way.

1373
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:24,641
Like this cool
bull named Boston.

1374
01:25:25,946 --> 01:25:29,428
I could tell life shook him
up a little bit, just like us.

1375
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:30,212
True.

1376
01:25:30,255 --> 01:25:31,778
- Yeah.

1377
01:25:31,822 --> 01:25:34,520
I mean, think about it,
he lost his parents,

1378
01:25:34,564 --> 01:25:37,523
in a whole nother city,
don't really know anybody,

1379
01:25:39,046 --> 01:25:41,048
but deep down I know
he's still a good dude.

1380
01:25:42,224 --> 01:25:45,836
Then there's this
nice bad one, Asian.

1381
01:25:45,879 --> 01:25:46,663
Bad one?

1382
01:25:46,706 --> 01:25:47,490
Yeah.

1383
01:25:48,708 --> 01:25:52,059
The only thing is
she's a cutter.

1384
01:25:52,103 --> 01:25:52,886
Damn.

1385
01:25:54,279 --> 01:25:55,585
- Yeah, she cuts herself.

1386
01:25:56,803 --> 01:25:58,718
But she's just, she
has a good spirit.

1387
01:26:00,285 --> 01:26:02,287
She holds it together
as much as she can.

1388
01:26:04,637 --> 01:26:07,336
And this girl named Philly.

1389
01:26:07,379 --> 01:26:08,685
Boston calls her Philly.

1390
01:26:10,121 --> 01:26:11,688
I think there's something
going on between them,

1391
01:26:11,731 --> 01:26:13,559
but that's none of my business.

1392
01:26:15,735 --> 01:26:17,868
You could tell she's
going through things.

1393
01:26:19,696 --> 01:26:20,479
Even now.

1394
01:26:21,524 --> 01:26:23,047
All of them are good people,

1395
01:26:24,353 --> 01:26:27,878
but just meeting all
them gives me hope.

1396
01:26:30,054 --> 01:26:32,752
It tells me that
people are still

1397
01:26:32,796 --> 01:26:35,146
going through
things just like us.

1398
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:36,887
We're not alone in this.

1399
01:26:36,930 --> 01:26:37,801
Yeah.

1400
01:26:37,844 --> 01:26:38,889
- They're fighting just like us.

1401
01:26:41,892 --> 01:26:43,850
And if there's hope for them,

1402
01:26:43,894 --> 01:26:45,243
damn sure gonna be hope for us.

1403
01:26:45,287 --> 01:26:46,331
- That's true.

1404
01:26:46,375 --> 01:26:47,158
Yeah.

1405
01:26:49,073 --> 01:26:51,641
I have one
question, though.

1406
01:26:51,684 --> 01:26:52,555
What's that?

1407
01:26:53,991 --> 01:26:55,340

1408
01:26:56,515 --> 01:26:58,604
I'm dead serious.

1409
01:26:58,648 --> 01:26:59,431
Like for real.

1410
01:27:00,780 --> 01:27:02,086
- You need to
worrying about that

1411

interview with Miss
Brooks tomorrow.

1412
01:27:03,957 --> 01:27:04,741
True.

1413
01:27:06,003 --> 01:27:07,787
Not asking me
if I smashed anything.

1414
01:27:23,150 --> 01:27:24,326
- I just um...

1415
01:27:26,980 --> 01:27:28,808
I don't know what I'm doing.

1416
01:27:30,984 --> 01:27:32,725
I don't know what to do.

1417
01:27:36,990 --> 01:27:41,995
I feel really confused and
give me some type of sign.

1418
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:48,001
Show me something,
tell me something.

1419
01:27:53,006 --> 01:27:54,573
I'm not trying to be selfish.

1420
01:27:59,970 --> 01:28:02,494
I can't live this way anymore.

1421
01:28:07,369 --> 01:28:10,981
I feel like I'm just
watching my life go by

1422
01:28:12,243 --> 01:28:16,073
and I spend every moment
worrying about you.

1423

I'm not happy.

1459
01:32:43,949 --> 01:32:46,604
- Yeah, I was actually
looking for Rome?

1460
01:32:46,648 --> 01:32:47,823
- How do you know him?

1461
01:32:47,866 --> 01:32:49,781
- We've got a class together.

1462
01:32:51,391 --> 01:32:53,002
- I remember when
I was in school.

1463
01:32:54,873 --> 01:32:56,222
- Okay.

1464
01:32:56,266 --> 01:32:57,484
Is he home or?

1465
01:32:58,790 --> 01:33:00,531
- No, he actually
left 30 minutes ago.

1466
01:33:00,575 --> 01:33:02,011
He left with his basketball.

1467
01:33:03,490 --> 01:33:04,579
- Makes sense.

1468
01:33:04,622 --> 01:33:05,536
Alright, thank you.

1469
01:33:09,279 --> 01:33:12,021
- I knew he'd like Philly.

1470
01:33:35,131 --> 01:33:37,307
- Push, push, push, touch!

1471
01:33:37,350 --> 01:33:39,788
Back, come on, come on,
push, come on, push.

1472
01:33:39,831 --> 01:33:41,093
To the line, come on.

1473
01:33:41,137 --> 01:33:42,529
You gotta be tough!

1474
01:33:42,573 --> 01:33:43,748
You gotta be strong!

1475
01:33:45,358 --> 01:33:48,448
You gotta want this
like you wanna breathe!

1476
01:33:48,492 --> 01:33:50,537
- I do want this, Coach!

1477
01:34:11,167 --> 01:34:13,299
- What are you
doing here, Philly?

1478
01:34:13,343 --> 01:34:17,956
- Well, there's only three
courts around your house,

1479
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,002
so this was my second guess.

1480
01:34:22,265 --> 01:34:23,658
- How'd you know where I live?

1481
01:34:24,615 --> 01:34:26,051
- I did a little snooping.

1482
01:34:29,576 --> 01:34:31,361
- Does your boy Big
P know you're here?

1483
01:34:32,797 --> 01:34:33,929
- Rome, please.

1484
01:34:38,542 --> 01:34:39,935
Look, I'm sorry.

1485
01:34:42,502 --> 01:34:45,114
I'm sorry for everything
that's happened to you,

1486
01:34:45,157 --> 01:34:46,376
everything that's happen to me.

1487
01:34:49,553 --> 01:34:50,336
I am.

1488
01:34:54,384 --> 01:34:55,690
- You know when I first saw you

1489
01:34:58,431 --> 01:34:59,737
I couldn't take my eyes off you.

1490
01:35:01,565 --> 01:35:03,698
You came into my life fast.

1491
01:35:06,439 --> 01:35:10,008
I should have been thinking
about my mom, my dad.

1492
01:35:10,052 --> 01:35:11,357
I should have been mourning.

1493
01:35:11,401 --> 01:35:13,229
I know that.

1494
01:35:13,272 --> 01:35:15,666
Instead I was thinking of you.

1495
01:35:23,021 --> 01:35:25,937
I can't make you
choose between us.

1496
01:35:25,981 --> 01:35:27,504
Between me and him.

1497
01:35:30,637 --> 01:35:32,552
I can't do that to you.

1498
01:35:36,687 --> 01:35:37,470
- I love him.

1499
01:35:44,564 --> 01:35:46,653
But I'm in love with you.

1500
01:36:09,502 --> 01:36:11,243
- Let's play one on one.

1501
01:36:11,287 --> 01:36:12,592
- Are you crazy?

1502
01:36:13,855 --> 01:36:14,769
- I'm a basketball
star, play your heart.

1503
01:36:14,812 --> 01:36:16,727
- It's raining, my hair.

1504
01:36:16,771 --> 01:36:20,949
- Friendships and family
are hard to tell apart.

1505
01:36:22,602 --> 01:36:26,302
That connection, that longing,

1506
01:36:26,345 --> 01:36:29,218
that feeling we have
for another person.

1507
01:36:30,523 --> 01:36:33,483
It's not blood that binds us.

1508
01:36:33,526 --> 01:36:37,530
It's simply the ability
to trust someone.

1509
01:36:37,574 --> 01:36:39,706
To trust someone
other than yourself.

1510
01:36:40,969 --> 01:36:42,535
That's what bonds
you to someone.

1511
01:36:44,624 --> 01:36:48,585
The connections you make
at this point in your life

1512
01:36:48,628 --> 01:36:51,806
are so important to the
person you'll become,

1513
01:36:52,937 --> 01:36:54,721
to the type of
adult you'll become,

1514
01:36:56,245 --> 01:36:58,769
perhaps the type of parent
you'll become to your child.

1515
01:36:59,770 --> 01:37:01,206
And how do we do that?

1516
01:37:01,250 --> 01:37:03,339
We connect by being vulnerable.

1517
01:37:04,688 --> 01:37:06,864
By opening up and
sharing our past.

1518
01:37:08,170 --> 01:37:10,259
And we all have a past.

1519
01:37:10,302 --> 01:37:12,130
Some of them are
scarier than others.

1520
01:37:13,653 --> 01:37:16,613
Some of us have
faced death head on.

1521
01:37:18,310 --> 01:37:19,877
Some of us have lost loved ones.

1522
01:37:21,618 --> 01:37:24,708
Some of us have fallen in love,

1523
01:37:25,622 --> 01:37:27,885
only to have our heart
broken.

1524
01:37:27,929 --> 01:37:28,930
The list goes on.

1525
01:37:30,540 --> 01:37:34,587
But there's one thing that we
all, we all have in common.

1526
01:37:35,675 --> 01:37:36,981
We're all standing here.

1527
01:37:38,504 --> 01:37:40,724
We are all standing here today

1528
01:37:41,681 --> 01:37:43,988
and we will continue to stand.

1529
01:37:45,860 --> 01:37:49,254
To continue to pursue what we

1530
01:37:49,298 --> 01:37:53,693
feel we need to gain happiness.

1531
01:37:53,737 --> 01:37:56,914
I presented you, at the
beginning of this course,

1532
01:37:56,958 --> 01:38:01,092
with the challenge of getting
to know your inner self.

1533
01:38:02,441 --> 01:38:06,358
Something we truly
cannot do as children,

1534
01:38:06,402 --> 01:38:09,405
still blind to the
horrors in the world.

1535
01:38:10,710 --> 01:38:13,409
I asked you to do this by
getting to know your group.

1536
01:38:14,932 --> 01:38:17,630
By asking questions
of them, about them.

1537
01:38:19,981 --> 01:38:23,158
Getting to know them and seeing

1538
01:38:23,201 --> 01:38:28,206
yourself in their eyes,
through their eyes.

1539
01:38:29,425 --> 01:38:31,557
So you would take this
seriously I offered

1540
01:38:31,601 --> 01:38:35,039
you the one thing,
the one incentive,

1541
01:38:35,083 --> 01:38:37,433
that I knew you
could all comprehend.

1542
01:38:37,476 --> 01:38:38,869
And that is?

1543
01:38:38,913 --> 01:38:40,349
Money.

1544
01:38:40,392 --> 01:38:41,654
- Money, that's right.

1545
01:38:43,221 --> 01:38:47,922
The decision as to who won
was very, very difficult.

1546
01:38:49,053 --> 01:38:49,924
All of your papers
were wonderful

1547
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:53,014
and a million other adjectives

1548
01:38:53,057 --> 01:38:54,929
that really don't
need expression.

1549
01:38:55,973 --> 01:38:57,061
So I say this.

1550
01:39:01,761 --> 01:39:03,589
You're all winners.

1551
01:39:04,677 --> 01:39:05,722
And

1552
01:39:07,158 --> 01:39:08,768
there is no money.

1553
01:39:09,769 --> 01:39:11,119
What?

1554
01:39:18,213 --> 01:39:21,956
- The real reward from
what you've learned

1555
01:39:21,999 --> 01:39:25,568
is in understanding
and appreciating

1556
01:39:25,611 --> 01:39:27,439
one of life's
greatest mysteries.

1557
01:39:28,701 --> 01:39:31,661
Although we are all born
into this world alone,

1558
01:39:34,055 --> 01:39:37,362
we are also born in it together.

1559
01:39:38,711 --> 01:39:41,627
And that person
sitting next to you

1560
01:39:43,238 --> 01:39:46,241
is more important
and always will be

1561
01:39:46,284 --> 01:39:48,634
more important than
any amount of money.

01:41:32,999 --> 01:41:35,915
- Ready to play, coach?

1585
01:41:35,959 --> 01:41:38,483
- You know I'm not gonna
take it easy on you?

1586
01:41:38,527 --> 01:41:40,006
My knees may be bad,

1587
01:41:41,443 --> 01:41:42,922
but my elbow's still sharp.

1588
01:41:45,708 --> 01:41:46,491
- Hey, Coach.

1589
01:41:50,016 --> 01:41:51,540
I want to say I'm sorry.

1590
01:41:52,584 --> 01:41:55,152
You've always been there for me.

1591
01:41:55,196 --> 01:41:55,979
And,

1592
01:41:57,285 --> 01:41:58,068
I let you down.

1593
01:42:01,898 --> 01:42:05,858
- Listen, I'm proud of
the man you've become.

1594
01:42:05,902 --> 01:42:07,643
Your mother would be proud, too.

1595
01:42:09,297 --> 01:42:11,864
I always thought
of you as my son.

1596
01:42:18,958 --> 01:42:20,221
Caught you lookin'!

1597
01:42:20,264 --> 01:42:21,265
Yo!
