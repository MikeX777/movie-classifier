1
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:16,068
This film is dedicated to prisoners of war.

2
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:20,072
Their unbroken spirit is the
symbol of a moral victory

3
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,574
for which no bells have pealed.

4
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,007
And which will
not be remembered

5
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:27,569
with the battle names on
regimental colors.

6
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:31,242
It was a war in which
no decorations could be given,

7
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:32,909
but to have come out of it

8
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:37,082
with a whole spirit
is its highest honor.

9
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,421
These are a few of those men

10
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:42,086
captured in the summer of 1 940.

11
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,255
They were the men who
stood on the Dial,

12
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,423
the Somme,
and the La Basi Canal,

13
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:49,093
who fought at Calais,
April, St. Valery,

14
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:53,606
and the vital perimeter around
the Beaches of Dunkirk,

15
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:58,610
the men who held on until the German armor
thundered past their lines.

16
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:02,614
220 miles they marched
into captivity,

17
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:07,119
through that blazing, gusty June,
through France, through Belgium,

18
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:10,179
through Holland,
to the Rhine.

19
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,174
Ahh...

20
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,177
Beer isn't what
it used to be.

21
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,679
I hope the French beer isn't what
it used to be, either.

22
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,180
Remember the last time, Ted?.

23
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,683
Yeah, I remember something
better than beer, too.

24
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,845
Ooh, she was
a smasher.

25
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,183
I can see her
hair now,

26
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,689
blacker than coal.

27
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,693
Ooh, boy!. She taught
me a thing or two.

28
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,695
Pity you kept it to yourself.

29
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:27,199
It's proud we should be married
to a couple of Don Juans.

30
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,201
Don't believe a girl
ever looked at him twice.

31
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,702
Poor old dear.

32
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,203
Yes, you looked twice, didn't you?.

33
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,705
You caught me off me guard.

34
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,241
I was low following the flu.

35
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:38,209
Wonder what made you marry me.

36
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,213
You don't know?.
That wicked tenor voice you have.

37
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,714
Leave them.
That's men tend to that.

38
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,010
Any more for any more?.

39
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,710
No, thank you.

40
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,377
It's nearly 1 2:00.
We've got to be at the depot at 700.

41
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,818
Come on home,...

42
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:50,719
we'll have 'em both back
before you can turn round.

43
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,223
War will be over
by Christmas.

44
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,725
War will be over
by Christmas?.

45
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,090
Where have I heard
that before?.

46
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:56,719
It's a shame we got to
close the business.

47
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,730
Why, it's just habit
we've got into,

48
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,732
fighting the same war
every 20 years.

49
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,233
Nasty habit, too.

50
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,234
Good night, Flo.

51
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,736
Good night.

52
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,237
See you in the morning.

53
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,466
All right.

54
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,235
She's a troubled worrier,...

55
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,901
Shame she never had kids.

56
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,241
And her always wanting them so much.

57
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,746
They'd have took her mind off things.

58
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,078
Well, it's too late now, I suppose.

59
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,085
Are you sorry Glad and Mary are grown up?.

60
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:23,247
Well, I am and I'm not,
in a manner of speaking.

61
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,917
What about starting
all over again, old girl?.

62
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,755
No, thank you, Ted.

63
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,761
I'm too old for that kind of war work.

64
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,319
Ha ha ha!

65
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,284
Thanks, Stephen.
I liked that a lot.

66
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:02,844
The boy definitely shows promise.

67
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:03,854
Nearly 1 :00.

68
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:04,855
May I catch a lift?.

69
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:05,856
Yes, of course.

70
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,358
Come on, Carol.
Put your bonnet on.

71
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,860
Cheerio, Stephen.
See you before you embark.

72
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,020
Right-o, Robert.

73
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,859
Good-bye, Stephen, darling.
Take care of yourself.

74
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:12,863
Good night.

75
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,422
Well, wait for me.

76
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,870
Stephen.

77
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,872
Come on, Carol!

78
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,374
All right, Robert!

79
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,434
Caroline.

80
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,440
Caroline!
Caroline!

81
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,860
Stephen.

82
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:44,453
Caroline.

83
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,957
You left your scarf.

84
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,904
I know.

85
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,906
I had to come back.

86
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,407
Robert.
What about him?.

87
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,410
I wanted to tell you.

88
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,345
It's all over with Robert.

89
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:04,406
I think he understands.

90
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,418
I told him 3 weeks ago.

91
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,477
We met 3 weeks ago.

92
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,480
I wasn't sure until tonight.

93
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:14,982
Caroline.

94
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:29,441
You've only 48 hours
before you go to France.

95
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:33,946
It's nothing and it's everything.

96
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,446
Everything.

97
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,507
I hope you know how
to get a special license.

98
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:28,498
And don't forget to write, David.

99
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,001
Yes, Mum.

100
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,502
And let us know if there's
anything you want.

101
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:32,833
Thank you, Mrs. McDougall.

102
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,065
Will you write to me, Elspeth?.

103
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,129
David, I will.

104
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:36,504
You see, l--

105
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,013
Yes, David.

106
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,013
Good-bye, David.

107
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,515
Good-bye, David, my boy.

108
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,017
Good-bye, Mother.

109
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,518
Take care of yourself, David.

110
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,020
Yes, Mrs. McDougall.
Elspeth, you see, l--

111
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,180
Me too, David.

112
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,518
What did you say?.

113
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,024
I love you.

114
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,617
Elspeth. Elspeth,
will you marry me?.

115
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,094
Yes, David!

116
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,089
What's he talking about?.

117
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,681
Sorry.
I've no idea.

118
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,784
Can I be of any help?.

119
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:03,522
Do you speak German?.
Good.

120
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,938
He says the officers must be
separated from the men.

121
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,102
But we must keep the wounded with us.

122
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,612
We've only got one M.O.
among the lot of us.

123
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,556
He says they may stay with us
till we reach the camp.

124
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:35,184
Thank you.

125
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:38,128
Anyway, a lot of them will remain
automatically on the orderlies'...

126
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,129
That's right.

127
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,688
Well, come on, lads.
In we go.

128
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,151
How's tricks,...?.

129
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,151
Mustn't grumble, sir.

130
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,653
You'll feel better
with a...

131
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,155
Thank you, sir.

132
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:09,160
I don't know that you ought
to smoke with that chest.

133
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,661
Oh, it's nothing.
Wound's practically healed.

134
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,664
It's a pretty bad show all around.

135
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,166
I take it you fellows feel the same as I do.

136
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,828
We mustn't let the Jerries see we're down.

137
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,165
Take the Jerries to get me down?.

138
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,500
It's them ruddy cobbles.

139
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,666
What can I do for my feet, sir?.

140
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,676
Do what I do.
Try to forget 'em.

141
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,177
I can't take 'em off, can l?.

142
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,611
How are you, Lennox?.
Eyes hurting you a bit?.

143
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:30,171
A wee bit, sir.

144
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,183
We'll get the Jerries to give you
some proper treatment

145
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,185
As soon as we reach camp.

146
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,185
Thank you, sir.

147
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,188
How about you?.

148
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,190
Mustn't grumble.

149
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,190
You okay?.

150
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,191
Not too bad.

151
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,192
How's the arm?.

152
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,193
Feels better now,
sir.

153
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,854
Good boy.
All right, lads.

154
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,693
It won't be long now.

155
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,701
Then you'll be able to have a real rest.

156
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,703
Thanks for the help just now.

157
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,705
Useful man to know.
Perfect German.

158
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,708
Dalrymple's my name.
31 st Lancers.

159
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,710
Geoffrey Mitchell,
5th Oxfordshire light infantry.

160
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,645
Oh, where did the
Jerries pick you up?.

161
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:06,217
Oh, really?. I didn't know the 5th
were anywhere near there.

162
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,274
Yes.

163
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,920
March to attention!

164
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,433
Good afternoon.

165
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,935
Good afternoon.
Do sit down, would you?.

166
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,437
Thank you.

167
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,439
My name's Celia mitchell.

168
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,941
I've heard my husband may
be a prisoner of war--

169
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,443
Captain Geoffrey Mitchell.

170
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:55,446
Maybe. Didn't the war office
notify you, Mrs. Mitchell?.

171
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:58,950
Well, no, you see, I don't suppose
he put me down as next of kin.

172
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,952
Oh, I beg your pardon.

173
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,453
Your husband's regiment?.

174
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,954
5th Oxford
light infantry.

175
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:07,959
General index. Give me particulars
of Captain Geoffrey Mitchell,

176
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,961
5th Oxfordshire
light infantry, will you?.

177
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,462
I'd like to send him parcels.

178
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,963
I suppose I can do that.

179
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,465
Oh, yes, certainly.

180
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:18,469
... flag 27.
Prisoner of war number 1376.

181
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,027
Thank you.

182
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:29,980
Hello, Mummy!

183
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,482
Hello, darling.

184
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,983
Have you had a lovely day
with Grandpa?.

185
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,986
Will Father ever come back to us,
Grandpa,

186
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,988
Even when the war's over?.

187
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,990
Well, would you be glad if he did?.

188
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,992
No. He used to make Mummy cry.

189
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,322
He is a prisoner.

190
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:43,418
Hello, Desmond.

191
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:44,484
Hello, Mummy.

192
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:47,054
Janet, I'll leave you in charge.

193
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,004
Well?.

194
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:57,065
He didn't put me down as next of kin.

195
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:06,518
Well, that seems to be the final gesture,
doesn't it, my dear?.

196
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,019
It was only logical, I suppose.

197
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,419
Poor Geoffrey.

198
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:12,013
Poor Geoffrey?.

199
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:15,527
Well, I for one don't intend to shed
any tears over him.

200
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,027
Father?.

201
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,030
I'm going to write to him.

202
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,030
You are?.

203
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,532
Yes.

204
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,534
Can't do any harm or good.

205
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:26,537
They must be glad
of any news of home.

206
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,038
I don't suppose poor Geoffrey
ever portrayed

207
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,540
the faintest interest in his home.

208
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,042
I can tell him how the children
are getting on.

209
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:35,046
I can see Geoffrey regaling
his fellow prisoners

210
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:38,049
with news of the children he's
scarcely ever seen.

211
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,051
You're afraid, aren't you, Father?.

212
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,714
Certainly. I'm afraid that you may let
yourself be carried away

213
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:47,054
by sentimentality and suggest
patching things up with him.

214
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,924
Don't worry.

215
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:52,054
We said so many hard,
cruel things to each other.

216
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,065
I'd like to wipe out
the memory of them.

217
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,567
And then if we should happen to meet
when the war's over,

218
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,626
it won't be as enemies.

219
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,592
Here. Go easy
with the soap.

220
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,093
Sorry, old boy.

221
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:26,097
We may make it last 2 days more
if we're very careful.

222
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:29,100
After that, we've got to make
do with godliness.

223
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:32,103
I say, Padre, what are you smoking?.
Sauerkraut?.

224
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,105
Fag ends, fag ends, fag ends.

225
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,108
Lucky fellow. I'm down to
Mr. Middleton's specials.

226
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,112
I hear there's a bush up by the...

227
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,613
That's not too bad in a pipe.

228
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,114
Had a marvelous
dream last night.

229
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,616
Anybody I know?.

230
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,117
Eggs and bacon.

231
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,620
Tomato ketchup this time.

232
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,622
We must have lost
a shocking lot of stuff.

233
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,282
There's nothing to stop 'em.

234
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,620
He's bound to invade
before the end of summer,

235
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,126
And that's the end of us.

236
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,628
Here, steady.
What about the home fleet?.

237
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,129
What about the Luftwaffe
waiting for the home fleet?.

238
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,631
Well, of all the damn defeated!

239
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,132
Well, if you prefer to be a ruddy halfwit.

240
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,634
What about the RAF?.

241
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,294
Hitler can't stage an invasion

242
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,133
until he's got control of the air,

243
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,140
and I don't see the boys handing
him that on a plate.

244
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,641
Hear, hear!

245
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,973
You can't judge Hitler
by ordinary standards.

246
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:17,709
If he thinks he'll invade,
he'll invade.

247
00:20:24,122 --> 00:20:26,647
My old woman makes the kids pay a penny
a week for the Red Cross.

248
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,159
I'm writing to her to stop that caper.

249
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,661
Red ruddy Cross!

250
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,663
Bloody sausage we
ever get out of it!

251
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,198
It's only 2 months.

252
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:38,168
Don't forget, there were only a few
hundred prisoners here before.

253
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,670
Now there are tens of thousands.

254
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,000
It's a big job.

255
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,665
Yeah. Don't let's kid ourselves.

256
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,333
Nobody worries about us anymore.

257
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,172
We've been written off.

258
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,179
You're a pessimist.

259
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,839
How do you spell "sufficient"?.

260
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,678
Same as the Sergeant
Major's blessing,

261
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,684
Two "F"s and 1 "C".

262
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,185
Writing about the grub.

263
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,687
Muck, I call it.

264
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,519
Bit of the old woman's cooking,
is what I'd like now.

265
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:02,116
What a sucker I was
joining the ruddy army.

266
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:05,186
Pitching meself coming it loose with some
of those rowdy old French dames.

267
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:08,199
Here I am shut up in this place,
then I'll be past it.

268
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:11,202
You ought to have joined the Navy
and let the world see you.

269
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,204
Now, son, there's no use you blowing off.

270
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,705
Take things as you find them,

271
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,365
That's always been my motto.

272
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:17,703
The way I look at it is--

273
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,209
Look at you!
Drip, drip, drip.

274
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,711
You turn me up.
You're worse than a woman.

275
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,713
Knock it, sonny.
I was swinging a rifle

276
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,214
when your nappies was
swinging on the line.

277
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,217
Swinging a lead, more like it.

278
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,219
Here, if you're looking for a kip
on the ear, my lad,

279
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,720
you've come to
the right person.

280
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:30,982
Ohh!

281
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:32,216
That cigarette.
Let me see it.

282
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,656
What do you mean see it?.

283
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:35,215
Well, it's a Player's.
Where did you get it?.

284
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,727
Saved it up, of course.
What's it got to do with you?.

285
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,228
I had 3 Player's left.
You stole it!

286
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,491
Ah, go chase yourself.

287
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:40,724
Hand it over!

288
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:41,731
Pipe down, you little Welshman.

289
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,789
Give it back.

290
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:53,243
You did pinch that fag of young...

291
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,745
Yes, I did. So what?.

292
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:55,745
Just this.

293
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,748
Ooh!

294
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,478
Been asking for it, sonny.

295
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:05,251
I'm a man of peace, and peace is what
I'm gonna have plenty of in here.

296
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:08,521
Blimey. They'll have to have you
at the peace conference.

297
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:10,185
How are you today, Jessup?.

298
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:11,251
Mustn't grumble, sir.

299
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,695
Managed to get on his feet.

300
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,265
We'll soon get you out of here.

301
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,325
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.

302
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,273
Morning, Lennox.

303
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,603
Oh, good morning, sir.

304
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,142
Got some good news for you, David.

305
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:26,575
Yes, Padre?.

306
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:29,273
Yes, my lad. You'll be rejoining
the rest of us tomorrow.

307
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,781
Oh, that's fine, sir.

308
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:33,283
And I'll be able to take this bandage off.

309
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,876
Not yet, I'm afraid.

310
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:38,286
You'll have to wait till the optic nerve
is completely healthy again.

311
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,291
Then they'll send you to the
eye hospital for an operation.

312
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:43,294
So you'll have to be
a very patient patient, my boy.

313
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,353
I'll do my best, sir.

314
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,355
That's right.

315
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,304
I'm sorry, mate.
I'll give you a packet of 20

316
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,307
when the Red Cross parcels come.

317
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,309
Losing my temper over a fag.

318
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,311
I shouldn't have left them roving about.

319
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,973
You know, you wouldn't be a bad lad,

320
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,811
if you got rid of
some of your nasty habits.

321
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:07,818
Don't knock it.
Leave all that reforming stuff to the padre.

322
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:10,320
What's your job in
Civvy Street?.

323
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:11,822
Only suckers work.

324
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,118
Oh, a "Y" boy, eh?.

325
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:14,317
You bet.

326
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,827
Me and Ted's
in the building business.

327
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:19,329
What about learning
the trade when we get home?.

328
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,332
I'll be home long
before you two mugs.

329
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,835
You got out of tougher
spots than this, eh?.

330
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:25,835
Sure.

331
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:26,836
Got a plan?.

332
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:27,837
Dozens of 'em.

333
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,339
For instance--

334
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,342
You know, I can't make up me mind

335
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,402
whether to turn this into a brigantine
or a schooner.

336
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,855
I wonder how Jane's
getting on these days?.

337
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,356
Who is Jane?.

338
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:47,858
Your girl?.

339
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,861
No, no, the Jane,
the strip in the "Mirror".

340
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:53,363
Oh, yes, the strip in the "Mirror".

341
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:54,865
Well, I suppose a highbrow like you

342
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:57,766
wouldn't read the "Daily Mirror."

343
00:23:57,836 --> 00:23:58,996
Why highbrow?.

344
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:01,368
I mean, perfect German
and all that sort of thing.

345
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,374
Spent much time in Germany?.

346
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,876
Yes, as a matter of fact, I have.

347
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:08,378
Come to think of it, it's funny
that none of the rest

348
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:09,880
of your chaps
got caught with you.

349
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:10,880
Yes.

350
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,541
Did you have a company?.

351
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:13,879
Yes, machine gun company.

352
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,442
Machine gun company?.

353
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:18,889
You see--

354
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:21,448
I think I'll turn it up.
Wound's hurting a bit.

355
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,899
And all I have to do is stow away
in one of them garbage bins

356
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,401
Or something--why,
it's as easy as--

357
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,439
If you're planning
an escape, Mathews,

358
00:24:34,506 --> 00:24:35,905
may I give you
a piece of advice?.

359
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,908
Individual escapes
hardly ever succeed.

360
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,409
These things have to
be very carefully planned

361
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,639
and coordinated by
a whole group.

362
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:43,271
All the same, sir, I'm
gonna have a go at it

363
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:45,373
If you have no objections.

364
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:47,475
Well, good luck to you.

365
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:52,585
Good luck.
Two-faced bleeder.

366
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:53,453
I don't know what it is,

367
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:55,425
but there's something
phony about that bloke.

368
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:56,927
Always sucking up
with the german m.O.

369
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:57,927
Like...
Or somebody.

370
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,987
Look, men.

371
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,936
That settles it.

372
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:08,302
But they do have machine gun
companies in the German army.

373
00:25:08,373 --> 00:25:10,034
Do you seriously think
he's a traitor?.

374
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:10,938
He speaks German
as well as any German.

375
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:13,443
Of course he does.
Why shouldn't he be a German

376
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:14,638
planted here
as a stool pigeon?.

377
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:15,873
That would account
for a lot of things.

378
00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:17,278
Yes, we're always
talking about home.

379
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,442
- He never does.
- I hate to believe it.

380
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:20,951
Come in.

381
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:23,146
May I report
something, sir?.

382
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:24,313
Go ahead.

383
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:26,152
Well, it's rather
confidential, sir.

384
00:25:26,224 --> 00:25:28,590
It's about somebody
we think's a 5th colonist.

385
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:29,456
An officer?.

386
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:30,961
A matter of fact, sir, it is.

387
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,189
Captain Mitchell, sir.

388
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:33,424
There you are.

389
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:34,965
A minute ago, he overheard me
planning a breakout

390
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,898
and went straight over and talked
to one of the German guards.

391
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:37,957
Thank you, Mathews.

392
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:38,968
Keep your mouth shut
for the time being.

393
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,437
Very good, sir.

394
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:42,973
There's only one thing
to do with a rat.

395
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:43,837
String him up!

396
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:44,967
Here, wait a bit.

397
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,476
Man's innocent
till he's proved guilty.

398
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,479
Don't let us behave
like a bunch of nazis.

399
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:49,912
Come on.

400
00:25:54,452 --> 00:25:58,149
Oh, Mitchell, you didn't destroy
your identity card, did you?.

401
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,281
No, why?.

402
00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:01,552
Oh, just check up.
Have a look at it?.

403
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:14,404
Do you mind duplicating
your signature?.

404
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:22,837
You can't do it, you swine,
'cause your name isn't Mitchell!

405
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,006
Come on, what are we waiting for?.
Let's get it over with!

406
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,580
Stop it!

407
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:27,845
If you have anything to say,
you better say it quick.

408
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,079
It's a long story, and--

409
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:32,946
You wouldn't believe a word of it.

410
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:34,013
You're dead right,
we wouldn't!

411
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:35,525
Shut up!
Go on, spill it.

412
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:38,822
I'm not a German.
I'm a Czech.

413
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:39,955
A Czech in British
officer's uniform?.

414
00:26:40,031 --> 00:26:41,020
That's bloody likely!

415
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:43,033
I'm in charge here.
Shut up, and that's an order!

416
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,425
Go on.

417
00:26:45,503 --> 00:26:47,630
I escaped from
a German concentration camp.

418
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:48,900
I got through to France,

419
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:50,532
and I took this uniform
and the identity card

420
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,543
from Mitchell's dead body.

421
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:55,543
It was my only chance if
the Germans caught up with me.

422
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,548
If that's the truth,
why didn't you tell us at once?.

423
00:26:57,616 --> 00:27:00,551
Would you have believed me
any more than you do now?.

424
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:03,554
Besides, I have more to fear
from the stool pigeons than you have.

425
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,180
You've no proof of your story.

426
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:07,053
None. How could I have?.

427
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,787
How do you come to speak such
perfect English and German?.

428
00:27:09,861 --> 00:27:13,297
My father was at the Czech embassy
in London after the last war.

429
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:14,559
I spent my childhood there.

430
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:17,568
German is a sort of second
language in Czechoslovakia.

431
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:21,072
I became professor of English
at Prague University.

432
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:23,073
I'm not much of a soldier, I'm afraid.

433
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:25,575
What were you talking about
to that guard just now?.

434
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:29,580
Oh, I was trying to get
a chess set for David Lennox.

435
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,081
Achtung! Achtung!

436
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:33,481
All British prisoners
will parade at once.

437
00:27:37,255 --> 00:27:38,586
You may get proof
of my story after all.

438
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,090
How?.

439
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:41,989
The civilian. His name's Forster.

440
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,584
- Gestapo.
- How do you know?.

441
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,596
For a time, he ran
the concentration camp I was in.

442
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:48,258
You think he'll recognize you?.

443
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,597
Well, if he does,
he'll do your job for you.

444
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,933
- Achtung! Achtung!
- Come on.

445
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:55,165
All British prisoners
will parade at once.

446
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:06,176
Stand your men at ease, please.

447
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,620
Stand at ease!

448
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:13,818
Gentlemen, I present to you
Herr Forster-- the foreign office.

449
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:14,620
Gentlemen...

450
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,594
For the time being,
all communications

451
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:21,291
between Germany and England
are at a standstill.

452
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:24,335
Your letters, therefore,
cannot leave this country.

453
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:26,836
To keep you informed, however,

454
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:31,137
our news bulletins will be
broadcast to you in English.

455
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:35,270
And as you cannot hope
to receive news from home,

456
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:37,177
arrangements have been
made for you

457
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:40,217
to broadcast messages
to your next of kin.

458
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,314
Will all those
who wish to avail themselves

459
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:49,224
of Herr Forster's offer,
take 3 paces forward!

460
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:10,680
You are the senior British officer?.

461
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,011
Yes.

462
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:15,678
Are your men afraid that this is
some sort of propaganda trick?.

463
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,279
Well, it's just possible.

464
00:29:18,356 --> 00:29:19,755
As you wish.

465
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,353
Your name?.

466
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,192
- Mitchell.
- Mitchell?.

467
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,596
You are the officer acting
as hospital interpreter.

468
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:29,655
Yes.

469
00:29:29,734 --> 00:29:32,430
I understand you speak
almost perfect German.

470
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:34,563
That's rather unusual
for an Englishman.

471
00:29:34,639 --> 00:29:35,628
Is it?.

472
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:38,437
I wonder why your face
seems familiar.

473
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,307
I have many friends in England.

474
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:41,709
Possibly we met there.

475
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,714
Possibly.

476
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,909
Excuse me.

477
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:47,542
Yes?.

478
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,851
Do you wish to continue
this conversation?.

479
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:53,390
No.

480
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,551
Prisoners cannot be required
to answer any questions

481
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,720
other than those relating to
name, rank, and number.

482
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,730
Quite, quite.

483
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,789
The matter is of no importance.

484
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,681
This is today's
official war communique

485
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:21,742
Issued by the
German high command.

486
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,756
The battle of Britain has entered
upon a new and final stage.

487
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:31,262
Annihilation of England's towns and cities
by the all-conquering Luftwaffe.

488
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:33,763
Last night, just before sunset,

489
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,766
air-raid sirens sounded their
ominous wailing notes

490
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:39,770
To the 9 million inhabitants
of greater london.

491
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:43,433
All night, an endless stream
of bombers roared about the city

492
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:46,136
Discharging their loads
of high-explosive

493
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:47,769
and incendiary bombs.

494
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:51,282
Anti-aircraft opposition
was negligible,

495
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:54,284
For the British do not possess the guns to
defend their homeland.

496
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:58,789
And this attack will continue
tonight from dusk till dawn

497
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:03,294
until the nerve center and capital
city of the British empire

498
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:07,297
Is reduced to a vast pile
of rubble, dust, and ashes.

499
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:11,233
The words of our great battle
hymn have come true at last.

500
00:31:14,405 --> 00:31:16,965
We march against England.

501
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:11,156
Come on, boys.
Let's give 'em our great battle hymn!

502
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:14,858
Roll out the barrel

503
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:18,869
We'll have a barrel of fun

504
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:22,805
Roll out the barrel

505
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:24,933
We've got the blues on the run

506
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:29,876
ing, boom, terrara

507
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:34,385
Sing out a song
of good cheer

508
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:37,387
Now's the time
to roll the barrel

509
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:40,891
'Cause the gang's all here

510
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:41,891
Come on!

511
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,396
Roll out the barrel

512
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:49,399
We'll have a barrel of fun

513
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:52,459
Roll out the barrel

514
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:56,906
We've got the blues
on the run

515
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:59,910
Zing, boom, terrara

516
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:03,914
Sing out a song
of good cheer

517
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:07,418
Mow's the time
to roll the barrel

518
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:10,977
'Cause the gang's all here

519
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:18,928
You should have come to see me
before this, Mrs. Evans.

520
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,430
Nothing wrong, is there?.

521
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:22,932
No, but you're not
exactly robust.

522
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,936
I had the flu last year,
but nothing since.

523
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,938
And you're over 40,
aren't you?.

524
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,439
Only just.

525
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:32,943
Well, we needn't make
any decision yet.

526
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,444
Decision?.

527
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:37,504
I may have to suggest
an operation.

528
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,951
I see.

529
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,749
Thank you, doctor.

530
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:45,448
I was at Finn's
the night before last.

531
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:46,951
Miracle none of us copped it.

532
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,959
The guvnor was just
standing around.

533
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,460
This one's on
the house, he said.

534
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:51,961
And it was.

535
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:52,962
Well, dear?.

536
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,521
Everything's all right.

537
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:57,966
Waste of time and money it was,
making me come and see the old doctor.

538
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,970
Your dad wants you
to make quite sure, you know.

539
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,471
Yes, of course.

540
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:03,973
I always felt
I'd failed him,

541
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,976
but never a word
of reproach.

542
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,478
There's kind he is,
all through.

543
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:10,980
But now,
now I won't fail him.

544
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,539
I know I won't.

545
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:34,004
Stephen wrote that for me.

546
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,006
My application's
been approved, Carol.

547
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,008
Staff job, west end...

548
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:40,510
I was going to ask you
for a photograph,

549
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:43,012
But perhaps I'm better without it.

550
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,514
Look, Robert,

551
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,516
Ever since Beryl's been
living here with me,

552
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:48,518
I've seen how crazy
she is about you.

553
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:50,019
Why don't you and she--

554
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,818
Beryl and I might have
made a go of it

555
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:54,187
if I hadn't met you first.

556
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:55,520
I'm sorry, Robert.

557
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:57,857
I did treat you shabbily.

558
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,863
No, you didn't.
I realize now

559
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:01,421
you were never more
than just fond of me.

560
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:04,525
You'd have realized it, too,
even if Stephen hadn't turned up.

561
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,035
I always will be
fond of you.

562
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:09,039
As long as you're happy.
That's what matters.

563
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,041
That's sweet of you.

564
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,599
My dear.

565
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,054
I'm sorry.

566
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:26,113
I'm not.

567
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:32,062
But it's got to be
good-bye, Robert.

568
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,620
Good-bye, Beryl.

569
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:59,589
Last Christmas,
I had my first concert.

570
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:02,148
It's there
I met Caroline.

571
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:11,601
Last christmas, I was in Dachau
concentration camp.

572
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:15,605
Christmas eve, a new batch
of prisoners came in.

573
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:19,109
One of them brought
me news of my family.

574
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:23,113
They'd been caught
giving food to a polish Jew.

575
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:27,117
They were taken out and shot.

576
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:32,054
My father, my mother.

577
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:33,112
All of them.

578
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,125
Only 36 shopping days
to Christmas.

579
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:37,457
Christmas. Parked around
a blazing fire

580
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,120
with a great bowl of hot rum punch.

581
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,630
Looks like it's snowing again.

582
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,131
That should raise
the temperature a bit.

583
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,134
What binds me is living
by courtesy of Jerry.

584
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,466
Can't see any future
in it, really.

585
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:48,630
They say the first
7 years are the hardest.

586
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:50,139
If the next 6 are
anything like this...

587
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,642
Well, the Red Cross parcels
are bound to arrive soon.

588
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,143
You've been saying that for
exactly 4 months.

589
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:57,648
I've been meaning it
for exactly 4 months.

590
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:59,649
All I can think
about is food.

591
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:02,311
Roast turkey,
mince pies, Christmas--

592
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:03,444
Oh, shut up!

593
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,167
Well, lad, it's me again.

594
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,725
Yes, padre.

595
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:23,230
David, they can't operate.

596
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:27,677
Not ever?.

597
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,235
No, David.

598
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:35,249
I won't ever see again?.

599
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:38,688
I don't believe it.
It's that German doctor.

600
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,018
When I get back
to Scotland--

601
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,251
No.

602
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:47,254
David, it's no use.
You've got to face it.

603
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,702
I'll not need this anymore.

604
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:55,705
You feel now there's
nothing left to live for,

605
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:59,709
And that feeling will
go on for a long time,

606
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:05,215
But then you'll begin
to remember the things that are left.

607
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:10,721
You'll begin to realize that this
darkness of yours is not absolute.

608
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:15,725
David, the things that make life
worthwhile for all of us--

609
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:20,230
Kindness, affection,
companionship--

610
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:24,234
The loss of your sight
can never argue those things, David.

611
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,236
We're your friends here.

612
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:31,241
We offer you our help
and understanding.

613
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:34,244
And waiting to
welcome you home

614
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:39,807
when all this is over,
are your own folk who love you.

615
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:46,312
I'll be all right.

616
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:10,474
18, 20, 21.

617
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:11,845
What's for tea?.

618
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:13,281
Fancy cakes.
Just fancy you've had 'em.

619
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,785
Good job we haven't got any
brass monkeys in here,

620
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:18,788
We'd have the RSPCA
down on us, and no error.

621
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:21,450
Can't you do anything
with this ruddy stove?.

622
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,516
Isn't there anything
else to burn?.

623
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,300
All right.

624
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,769
I never said a word, did l?.

625
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:35,305
Go on, burn the ruddy thing.

626
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:36,863
It's enough for a brew up.

627
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,311
They've come!
Hundreds and hundreds of 'em!

628
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,322
All right, I'll bite.
Hundreds of what?.

629
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,290
Red Cross parcels
with ruddy...

630
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:56,383
[all shouting]

631
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:03,332
The Red Cross parcels
are here!

632
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,665
Hooray!

633
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:07,328
Red Cross parcels
are here!

634
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,396
Hooray!

635
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:49,880
O come all ye faithful

636
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:54,384
Yoyful and triumphant

637
00:40:54,452 --> 00:41:00,322
o come ye, o come ye
to Bethlehem

638
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:09,399
Come and behold him

639
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:13,904
Born the king of angels

640
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:18,908
O come let us adore him

641
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:23,913
O come let us adore him

642
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:29,419
O come let us adore him

643
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:35,426
Christ the lord

644
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:39,930
Sing choirs of angels...

645
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:43,433
O.C. Sports--you.
O.C. music--Stephen Harley.

646
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:44,934
Anything else
I haven't covered?.

647
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:46,264
No. Extraordinary, isn't it?.

648
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,430
We seem to have
specialists on every subject.

649
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,940
Aren't you an expert
on anything?.

650
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:52,441
Only racing, I'm afraid.

651
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,944
I had thought of starting a little
bookmaking business.

652
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:56,274
Why not?. Anyway,
your money will be safe.

653
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:57,939
You can't welsh on us.

654
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:58,947
Ha ha!

655
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:12,962
Ok, number 4 shift.

656
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:13,962
How far?.

657
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:15,055
About 3 feet.

658
00:42:15,132 --> 00:42:16,463
Good. By the way,
doc, I put you down

659
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:17,466
O.C. Entertainment.

660
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,025
Fine.

661
00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:20,968
What about me?.
I've had masses of experience backstage.

662
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,300
What sort of experience?.

663
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:25,467
No need to make low
insinuendos, old man.

664
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:26,976
Come on, fellows!
Here it is!

665
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:28,534
Mail from home!

666
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:30,979
Baker!

667
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:31,980
Here!

668
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:32,981
Macdonald!

669
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,540
Here!

670
00:42:34,618 --> 00:42:37,485
My father's been thrown through
the dispensary window.

671
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,489
What, by an angry patient?.

672
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:40,990
No, a bomb.

673
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:42,491
Well, well, they've requisitioned
the church hall.

674
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,494
I say, that's serious.

675
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:45,494
What is?.

676
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,497
Veronica.
She sweats all night.

677
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,499
Well, surely she can
do something about it,

678
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,000
With all these
advertisements and things.

679
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:52,501
Don't be a halfwit.
Veronica's a filly

680
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,003
and is getting ready
for the flat.

681
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:58,201
Oh, sorry, old boy.
I thought she was a...

682
00:42:58,275 --> 00:43:00,004
My kids have been
evacuated to the country.

683
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:01,510
And my girl
joined the land army.

684
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,012
Said she'll wait for me
till the cows come home.

685
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,513
That's one way of putting it.

686
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:07,016
Listen to this.
"Dear Daddy, today is your birthday.

687
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:09,575
"l hope it will be your last."

688
00:43:14,558 --> 00:43:16,025
Hello, David.

689
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:18,027
I didn't notice.
Shall I read your letter for you?.

690
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:19,585
Thank you.

691
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:25,592
It's signed...Elspeth.

692
00:43:27,237 --> 00:43:28,534
"Dearest David,

693
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:31,541
"Your mother says I am
silly to worry about it,

694
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:35,545
"but it seems queer
not a word from you yet.

695
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:39,049
"Do please send me a line
when you get this.

696
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:42,711
"The three of us had
a little party on your birthday.

697
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:44,549
"Wouldn't it be wonderful,
darling

698
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:47,216
"if you were home again
for your next?.

699
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:49,555
"l miss you all the time.

"Your loving Elspeth.

"P.S. I'm going to join
the Wrens."

702
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:58,067
Will you do me a favor?.

703
00:43:58,135 --> 00:43:59,568
I'd like to answer it at once.

704
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:01,070
Yes, of course.

705
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:02,571
Here's a form.

706
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:06,576
I've got a pencil.
Ready when you are.

707
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:09,579
My dearest Elspeth,

708
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:13,879
I am dictating this
letter because my wound

709
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:16,579
Is not quite better yet.

710
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:19,555
I've been thinking things over.

711
00:44:19,623 --> 00:44:24,060
And this is to ask
if you will release me

712
00:44:24,128 --> 00:44:27,097
from our engagement.

713
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:31,396
I realize now I don't feel the way

714
00:44:31,468 --> 00:44:36,098
I fancied I did about you,

715
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:40,109
So it's best to make
a definite break.

716
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:41,667
Yours, David.

717
00:44:44,481 --> 00:44:46,108
David, why not
tell her the truth?.

718
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:47,616
It is the truth.

719
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,277
About your eyes, I mean.

720
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:51,116
Why not let her decide
when she knows?.

721
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:52,621
Will you please
send that letter?.

722
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:53,622
But David--

723
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:55,124
Please!

724
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:57,183
All right, David.

725
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:00,630
Ted, it's it!
It's it!

726
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:03,132
It's it!

727
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,134
Wonderful news, man,
wonderful.

728
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:08,000
It's Delish.
There's a baby coming.

729
00:45:08,072 --> 00:45:09,130
Good old Di!
I reckon that's

730
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:11,640
the best Christmas
present you ever had.

731
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:16,646
I can see her now,
the way she smiles with her eyes.

732
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:18,648
Aye, indeed.
It's lovely to--

733
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,149
How do I look
for a godfather?.

734
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:22,151
Why, yes!
That's it, man.

735
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:24,551
You and Flo.
It goes without saying.

736
00:45:24,621 --> 00:45:26,145
And what's the matter?.

737
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:28,657
Got the same chit
from the income tax as me, old boy?.

738
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:30,956
Well, don't worry.
They can't put us in jag.

739
00:45:31,028 --> 00:45:32,723
We've had it.

740
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,695
What wouldn't I give to see
Queen's Park play Rangers this year.

741
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:07,697
Never mind, padre.
They'll be playing over here one day.

742
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:09,198
Achtung! Achtung!

743
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:10,597
All British prisoners
will parade at once.

744
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:11,725
Hello! What's cooking?.

745
00:46:11,802 --> 00:46:14,703
Forster's on the warpath. They're gonna
search the camp with a fine comb.

746
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:16,205
Forster again.

747
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:18,207
Achtung! Achtung!

748
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:20,709
All British prisoners
will parade at once.

749
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:32,221
Achtung! Achtung!

750
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:34,723
All British prisoners
will parade at once.

751
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:55,744
Gentlemen, we have
discovered your tunnel.

752
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:59,241
Since you have thus abused
the amenities accorded you,

753
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:03,685
and pending reconsideration
of the camp's security measures,

754
00:47:03,754 --> 00:47:07,747
all these amenities will be removed
until further notice.

755
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:13,764
I've given instructions, therefore,
to confiscate all books, writing material,

756
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:17,767
music, all tables and chairs,

757
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:20,827
mirrors, knives,
and shaving equipment.

758
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:26,832
You may dismiss the...

759
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:30,836
Right. Dismissed.

760
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:40,285
I suppose I shall have to
grow a beard after all.

761
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:42,791
I don't know whether to have
one of those 2-pronged affairs

762
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,794
or a natty little imperial.

763
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:46,295
Wonder how long
they'll keep it up.

764
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:47,796
Not more than a month,
I should think.

765
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:49,298
Well, I'll keep on nagging
at the commandant.

766
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:50,856
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

767
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:53,802
Good afternoon.

768
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:56,806
I hope this slight setback won't
prevent you from trying again,

769
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:59,342
But I must add

770
00:47:59,409 --> 00:48:01,809
a moat will be dug around
the whole perimeter,

771
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:04,871
which, as you know,
makes tunneling impossible.

772
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:12,322
Captain mitchell, who speaks
such excellent German...

773
00:48:30,774 --> 00:48:33,743
What's he want this time?.

774
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:35,835
Wants to know why I haven't written
a single letter home.

775
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:37,346
Well, why should you?.

776
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:38,847
Mitchell may have had nobody
particular to write to.

777
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:40,349
But he had.

778
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:41,850
This came today.

779
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:43,910
It's from his wife.

780
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:47,856
You must answer it,
or she'll make enquiries.

781
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:49,358
You'll have to fake it.

782
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:50,859
Seems a pretty
cruel fraud.

783
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:52,361
You're wearing
a dead man's shoes.

784
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:53,862
You've got to get
used to the feel of them.

785
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:56,365
My handwriting. She'd know at once
it wasn't her husband.

786
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:57,866
Yes, take a bit of figuring out.

787
00:48:57,935 --> 00:48:59,869
Alibi for using your left hand.

788
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:01,928
That's what you need.

789
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:08,377
I can't see much point in this,

790
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:10,640
Now the blighters
have taken away the football.

791
00:49:10,714 --> 00:49:12,375
Well, anyway,
it's good exercise.

792
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:15,885
Think so?. I suppose next week
they'll give us back the football

793
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:17,887
and take away
the goalposts.

794
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:19,752
Come on, it's
your turn now.

795
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:27,452
Ready?.

796
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:49,475
Look out!

797
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:56,254
Good morning,
Mrs. Mitchell.

798
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:57,816
Thank you.

799
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:13,666
Oh, look.

800
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:18,038
I've mastered the boiler
and the tire pump.

801
00:50:18,115 --> 00:50:21,448
I won't be defeated by
a miserable wireless set.

802
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:22,951
I've heard from Geoffrey.

803
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,419
Really?.

804
00:50:24,488 --> 00:50:25,955
Is he well?.

805
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:27,547
I don't know what to make of it.

806
00:50:27,624 --> 00:50:29,114
He seems so changed.

807
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:34,289
Good. Any change in Geoffrey
could only be for the better.

808
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:37,800
Well, the change
seems to include his handwriting.

809
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:40,234
Hurt his hand.
Using his left.

810
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,974
Listen to this.

811
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:49,172
"it is a world cut off
completely from the real world.

812
00:50:49,246 --> 00:50:51,976
"Time stands still here.

813
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:55,849
"The future is remote.
The present empty.

814
00:50:55,919 --> 00:51:00,822
"Even the past begins
to seem unreal.

815
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:04,327
"But a man must have
something to hold onto.

816
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:08,660
He must forge lengths
to keep him sane.

817
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:12,326
"Will you write
to me again, celia,

818
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:15,269
"as though I were
a stranger?.

819
00:51:15,338 --> 00:51:19,638
"Somebody who knows nothing
of your life and your home.

820
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:24,312
"Even of yourself."

821
00:51:24,381 --> 00:51:25,848
Changed?.

822
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:30,615
Why, he's even learned
to write grammatically.

823
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:33,247
Write to him as though
he were a stranger.

824
00:51:50,407 --> 00:51:51,874
Robert!

825
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:53,375
Come back to be briefed.

826
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:55,035
Sort of a hush-hush job.

827
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:57,239
Thought you wouldn't mind
if I just called in this evening,

828
00:51:57,314 --> 00:51:59,339
Say hail and farewell.

829
00:51:59,416 --> 00:52:00,542
Of course not.

830
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:01,879
Come in.

831
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:04,216
You look ill, Carol.

832
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:06,687
I'm all right.

833
00:52:06,756 --> 00:52:09,782
I ran into Beryl
in an odd sort of mood.

834
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:12,192
I gather she isn't
living with you any longer.

835
00:52:12,262 --> 00:52:15,254
No. No, she left
soon after you went away.

836
00:52:15,332 --> 00:52:17,027
Heard from Stephen yet?.

837
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:19,034
Oh, yes, I've heard
from Stephen.

838
00:52:19,102 --> 00:52:20,228
What's he say?.

839
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:22,498
That our marriage
is all washed up.

840
00:52:22,572 --> 00:52:24,062
What?.

841
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:27,440
He got a letter accusing me
of having an affair with you.

842
00:52:27,511 --> 00:52:32,005
Carol, l-- but who?.

843
00:52:32,082 --> 00:52:34,243
Beryl.

844
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:35,579
Ahh...

845
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:37,085
I see.

846
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:38,985
And he actually believed it?.

847
00:52:39,055 --> 00:52:40,579
Yes.

848
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:43,387
I'll write back myself
and tell him the whole thing's

849
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:44,927
a deliberate, malicious lie.

850
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:46,428
What for?.

851
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:48,088
What for?. You don't want Stephen

852
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:50,099
to go on thinking this, do you?.

853
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:52,226
I don't care
what he thinks now.

854
00:52:52,302 --> 00:52:54,429
Carol, you mustn't
take it like that.

855
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:55,937
Stephen's a prisoner of war.

856
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,974
If you were in his place,
would you pay two seconds' attention

857
00:52:58,041 --> 00:52:59,531
to a poison pen letter?.

858
00:52:59,609 --> 00:53:01,668
I don't know.

859
00:53:04,281 --> 00:53:06,146
I'd never been
in love before.

860
00:53:08,952 --> 00:53:14,788
I thought being in love meant that
you trusted each other completely.

861
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:18,817
All the things he said,

862
00:53:18,895 --> 00:53:21,728
I believed every word.

863
00:53:21,798 --> 00:53:24,266
Killed my love for him.

864
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:31,936
Caroline, my darling,
I can't bear to see you cry.

865
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:42,818
Don't forget to
drop us a line, dear,

866
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:44,353
if there's anything you want.

867
00:53:44,421 --> 00:53:45,979
I've tried to get used to it,

868
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:47,546
Bu I still can't believe it.

869
00:53:47,624 --> 00:53:49,023
We were so much in love.

870
00:53:49,092 --> 00:53:50,491
Ah, it's a mystery to me.

871
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,323
He has a right to
change his mind, I suppose.

872
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:54,260
Could it be that he
doesn't think it's fair

873
00:53:54,331 --> 00:53:56,424
to make Elspeth
wait on and on?.

874
00:53:56,499 --> 00:53:57,864
Do you think it might
be that?.

875
00:53:57,934 --> 00:53:59,595
No. I don't think
David's the kind

876
00:53:59,669 --> 00:54:02,502
to make that sort of sacrifice
for that sort of reason.

877
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:04,829
Good-bye, my darling.

878
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:05,840
Good-bye.

879
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:06,898
Good-bye.

880
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:11,839
The photograph I'm sending

881
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:13,678
makes me look
absurdly young,

882
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:16,446
but I'm no longer young.

883
00:54:16,519 --> 00:54:17,781
The one of Janet,

884
00:54:17,854 --> 00:54:19,685
that funny expression's
only shyness,

885
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:21,018
not a stomach ache.

886
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:23,685
I can see her now
through the window

887
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:26,923
telling her grandpapa
how to plant tomatoes.

888
00:54:26,997 --> 00:54:28,589
I'm worried about her teeth.

889
00:54:28,665 --> 00:54:32,465
Father thinks she should wear
one of those wire things.

890
00:54:32,535 --> 00:54:37,029
And that hulking boy is Desmond.
9 years old yesterday.

891
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:40,042
The village is livelier
than it's ever been.

892
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:42,203
We have a large contingent
of evacuees

893
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:45,248
and a lot of other visitors
that come and go.

894
00:54:45,315 --> 00:54:48,045
Everything's changed and yet
nothing's changed.

895
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:50,518
There's the whistle
of the 4:35.

896
00:54:50,587 --> 00:54:52,680
Half an hour late as usual.

897
00:54:52,756 --> 00:54:55,850
Mrs. Trusket still serves
her homemade toffee.

898
00:54:55,925 --> 00:54:59,588
Where she manages to get
the sugar from, I can't imagine.

899
00:54:59,663 --> 00:55:02,131
And there's still cricket
on Saturday afternoon.

900
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:50,279
Oh, what a kick in the pants

901
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:51,780
that turned out to be.

902
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:53,440
5 times more officers
than other ranks

903
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:55,541
and they have to knock
the stuffing out of us.

904
00:55:55,618 --> 00:55:57,449
It was a mistake having Longarm too
close to the wire.

905
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,953
If he has to run back to take a catch,

906
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:00,114
- he's had it.
- Yeah.

907
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:01,487
Do you know what the
Jerries want for a new ball?.

908
00:56:01,558 --> 00:56:02,957
- What?.
- 500 cigarettes.

909
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:03,958
Sheer blackmail.

910
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:05,289
Oh, I think it's worth it

911
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:06,954
if this marvelous weather
continues.

912
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:10,124
I wonder if they've been having
an early spring at home.

913
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,930
"The apple trees are in
full blossom already,

914
00:56:13,002 --> 00:56:18,099
"making the orchard
look like a sheet of freezing snow.

915
00:56:18,174 --> 00:56:20,904
"And 1 0-Acre Meadow
is all white, too.

916
00:56:20,977 --> 00:56:22,308
"Because this year,

917
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:26,372
"that's where the ewes are
pastured with their lambs.

918
00:56:26,449 --> 00:56:29,646
"Soon the garden will
be filled with the scent

919
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:31,653
"and color of the May.

920
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:34,246
"And beyond the river,

921
00:56:34,324 --> 00:56:38,522
"you can see the first
vivid green of the larches

922
00:56:38,595 --> 00:56:42,395
"and the bluebell wood."

923
00:56:53,843 --> 00:56:55,708
- Ted?.
- Yeah?.

924
00:56:55,779 --> 00:56:57,679
Remember that redhead
I told you about?.

925
00:56:57,747 --> 00:57:00,011
Let's see, is that your
own true dream girl lovey pie

926
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:01,983
Or cheerio, toots?.

927
00:57:02,051 --> 00:57:03,382
It's my steady.

928
00:57:03,453 --> 00:57:05,853
She says the works manager's
fallen for her.

929
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:07,287
Says he s a key man.

930
00:57:07,357 --> 00:57:09,848
Sounds like one of them
backdoor key men to me.

931
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:11,359
You and your pinup girls.

932
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:14,363
My pinup's Tessie O'Shea,
with a...

933
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:15,591
Yeah, but in my experience--

934
00:57:15,665 --> 00:57:16,859
Your experience?.

935
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:19,333
God blarmy, one sniff
of a barmaid's apron,

936
00:57:19,402 --> 00:57:21,199
and you'd be on your knees,
sonny boy.

937
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:22,533
That's all you know.

938
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:24,596
Teach you
a thing or two.

939
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:29,203
What's the matter, Ted?.
Bad news?.

940
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:31,474
Ted?.

941
00:57:32,849 --> 00:57:34,612
Blimey, I never saw that one.

942
00:57:34,684 --> 00:57:37,050
Hey, my old woman's
got on the buses.

943
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,553
Oh, you'll be walking the kids
when you get home.

944
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:40,714
If we get home.

945
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:43,953
It's a firm stand
I'm gonna take.

946
00:57:44,027 --> 00:57:46,291
The rest of them
you can eat,

947
00:57:46,362 --> 00:57:48,159
but not Lili Marleen.

948
00:57:48,231 --> 00:57:52,224
She's got such
a trusting look in her eye.

949
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:57,569
Besides, next winter
I shall use her as a hot water bottle.

950
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:00,006
I've had a letter.

951
00:58:00,076 --> 00:58:03,910
Amazing.
Perhaps there's one for me

952
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,413
With news
of the baby.

953
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:07,575
No letter for you.

954
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:09,413
There is news.

955
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:11,351
Flora's all right?.

956
00:58:11,421 --> 00:58:13,252
Not Ann-Marie?.

957
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:14,950
She's okay.

958
00:58:15,024 --> 00:58:17,788
Letter's from her.

959
00:58:17,861 --> 00:58:21,991
"It's a baby girl.
She's doing nice.

960
00:58:22,065 --> 00:58:24,932
Until its..."

961
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:29,461
You'll have it
sooner or later.

962
00:58:29,539 --> 00:58:33,771
Seems that doctor warned
her about it being dangerous,

963
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:37,108
Because of her age.

964
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,512
She wouldn't be put off.

965
00:58:39,582 --> 00:58:42,642
Flo was with her
at the end.

966
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:45,279
It was all over
quite quick.

967
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:51,089
Flo's gonna look
after the baby until you get back.

968
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:09,640
The play's the thing.

969
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:13,148
We're in our catch
the conscience of the king.

970
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:15,013
Well, what happens
in the end?.

971
00:59:15,084 --> 00:59:17,575
Do they thump the
dirty old basket off?.

972
00:59:17,654 --> 00:59:19,849
Well, there's a sort of
all-round massacre,

973
00:59:19,923 --> 00:59:21,481
And Hamlet gets killed
himself.

974
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:22,991
That's gangster stuff.

975
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:24,651
The old boy certainly
knew his onion.

976
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:26,524
You wait till we get to
"Richard lll."

977
00:59:26,596 --> 00:59:28,860
There's a murder
on practically every page.

978
00:59:28,932 --> 00:59:31,162
You're getting pretty hot
at this business, David.

979
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:34,829
Oh, it's easy. But I'm still terrible
clumsy with my hands.

980
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:36,838
Oh, I don't know about that.

981
00:59:36,906 --> 00:59:38,737
That tobacco pouch you made
was a smashing job.

982
00:59:38,808 --> 00:59:41,003
I've got sort of used to it now.

983
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:43,011
And, well, you've all been so...

984
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:44,512
You get on with your reading.

985
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:46,173
I want to know
what happens next.

986
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:47,739
Right.

987
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:53,712
Celia, your letter has arrived
with the photographs.

988
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:55,553
They're in front of me
as I write.

989
00:59:55,625 --> 00:59:58,025
You ask me to describe
our life here

990
00:59:58,094 --> 01:00:01,530
so that you may picture it
in your imagination.

991
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:05,534
From where I sit,
I can hear the sound of a piano.

992
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:08,366
It is my friend Stephen Harley.

993
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:11,373
I wish you could hear
this music,

994
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:13,534
for it describes our life here

995
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:16,374
better than I could ever do
with words.

996
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:19,540
It tells of men emerging
from the twilight.

997
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:22,380
Turning their faces inward.
through wire.

998
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:26,513
Creating in miniature
a world of their own.

999
01:00:28,691 --> 01:00:31,558
It tells of men who have
come to terms with the present

1000
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:35,564
and find it far from empty.

1001
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:37,725
Men who no longer lie down
to fate

1002
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,233
but face it.

1003
01:00:40,870 --> 01:00:43,134
And find their own ways of beating it.

1004
01:01:55,445 --> 01:01:59,506
All this goes to make up
the picture of our life here,

1005
01:01:59,582 --> 01:02:01,914
made bearable only by
the letters and parcels

1006
01:02:01,984 --> 01:02:03,042
we receive from home.

1007
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:07,647
They keep our bodies
and our faith alive.

1008
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:09,783
And that is true not only of us

1009
01:02:09,859 --> 01:02:12,885
here in our little wired
enclosed cinder patch,

1010
01:02:12,962 --> 01:02:16,227
but also of the scores of
other camps throughout Germany.

1011
01:02:16,299 --> 01:02:19,666
Great sprawling towns
of 20,000 men

1012
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:24,935
or hamlets of a few hundred,
each a little piece of England.

1013
01:02:29,078 --> 01:02:33,014
Months pass and my thoughts
are constantly of you, Celia.

1014
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:37,610
Summer gives place to autumn,
autumn to winter.

1015
01:02:37,687 --> 01:02:39,951
Another Christmas
come and gone.

1016
01:02:40,022 --> 01:02:42,354
Another batch of prisoners
to swell our numbers.

1017
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:44,689
They don't make the housing
problem any easier.

1018
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:48,697
They bring us eagerly awaited
news of the outside world.

1019
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:50,756
A little while ago there was
a rumor

1020
01:02:50,833 --> 01:02:52,698
that some of us
were to be repatriated.

1021
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:55,329
I allowed myself to dream

1022
01:02:55,404 --> 01:02:57,372
that these letters of ours
could come to life.

1023
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:00,932
I could see with my own eyes
your home, the children,

1024
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:02,875
Yourself.

1025
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:05,379
But the commission
never came.

1026
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:06,881
Were we forgotten?.

1027
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:10,282
Or was it just
one more reprisal?.

1028
01:03:10,353 --> 01:03:12,947
Being they are prisoners,

1029
01:03:13,022 --> 01:03:15,456
this practice must come to rest.

1030
01:03:15,525 --> 01:03:18,494
Orders.

1031
01:03:18,561 --> 01:03:23,225
Finally,
the recent operation...

1032
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:28,532
As a reprisal for such
an unwarranted action,

1033
01:03:28,604 --> 01:03:34,304
All British prisoners of war
of cellblock 27

1034
01:03:34,377 --> 01:03:38,040
until further notice
remain manacled

1035
01:03:38,114 --> 01:03:41,049
from dawn until dusk.

1036
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:48,848
Brigade dismissed.
Carry on.

1037
01:04:18,888 --> 01:04:20,116
Cigarette?.

1038
01:04:20,189 --> 01:04:22,657
Thanks.

1039
01:04:22,725 --> 01:04:25,216
It's easy.
Sardine key.

1040
01:04:25,294 --> 01:04:27,091
Turn to the right.

1041
01:04:27,163 --> 01:04:28,960
Turn to the left.

1042
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:30,293
Bob's your uncle.

1043
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:32,391
All part of the
Red Cross service.

1044
01:04:32,468 --> 01:04:34,197
Ha ha!

1045
01:04:35,438 --> 01:04:38,339
Our third winter
is approaching

1046
01:04:38,407 --> 01:04:40,807
bringing with it a new enemy.

1047
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:44,836
It's not the duration
but the indefiniteness.

1048
01:04:44,914 --> 01:04:47,644
But if a man knew the length
of his sentence,

1049
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:50,151
he could plan accordingly.

1050
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:52,483
Afterwards in our memories,

1051
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:54,819
we shall relive
only the sunny days

1052
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:56,324
or pleasant scenes,

1053
01:04:56,392 --> 01:04:59,259
a freedom of mind
and the comradeship.

1054
01:04:59,328 --> 01:05:02,559
We shall forget the wet days,
the wet weeks.

1055
01:05:02,632 --> 01:05:05,328
Those days when it seemed
an effort to do nothing

1056
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:08,632
and our bunks were
the only release.

1057
01:05:08,704 --> 01:05:11,002
Deep down in the hearts
of all of us,

1058
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:13,166
there dwells a lonely ache,

1059
01:05:13,242 --> 01:05:16,643
a desperate yearning
for those we love

1060
01:05:16,712 --> 01:05:21,046
and a fear, fear of becoming
forgotten men.

1061
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:25,186
Write to me
again soon, Celia.

1062
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:27,518
You could never know
how great the comfort is

1063
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:29,490
that your letters
bring to me.

1064
01:05:29,558 --> 01:05:31,025
They're more than comforting.

1065
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:35,530
They give me strength
and hope and happiness.

1066
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:38,260
You will never know how much
they mean to me.

1067
01:05:40,102 --> 01:05:44,038
Oh, my dear, I am so terribly
moved by the way you write.

1068
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:50,067
Is it too late to recapture
the happiness or our best years together?.

1069
01:05:53,115 --> 01:05:57,211
I have no place
in your past or your future, Celia.

1070
01:05:57,286 --> 01:05:59,379
You must think of your husband
as dead.

1071
01:05:59,455 --> 01:06:01,548
This is good-bye.

1072
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:05,958
I understand.
Don't be afraid.

1073
01:06:06,028 --> 01:06:08,690
I'll help you back.

1074
01:06:08,764 --> 01:06:11,392
I'll give you back
your strength,

1075
01:06:11,467 --> 01:06:15,870
the strength you've given to me
writing to me through these dark years.

1076
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:19,934
I'll wait for you.

1077
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:09,017
Fortresses.

1078
01:07:09,091 --> 01:07:11,582
They'll soon
be able to see the channel.

1079
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:15,027
They'll be home
in time for tea.

1080
01:07:30,046 --> 01:07:33,311
That's exactly 157
pounds you owe me.

1081
01:07:33,382 --> 01:07:35,316
Cut you through the pack.
Double or quit.

1082
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:36,817
Not on your life.

1083
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:38,319
I've got me old age
to think of.

1084
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:39,786
Blood sucker.

1085
01:07:39,855 --> 01:07:42,983
Oh, well, there goes
my gratuity.

1086
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:45,323
Cheap enough
to pass the time.

1087
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:48,158
Funny how much you learn about time
when you're killing it.

1088
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:49,925
Such as what?.

1089
01:07:49,999 --> 01:07:53,264
I've got a theory that
everything that counts

1090
01:07:53,335 --> 01:07:55,326
Is done by busy people.

1091
01:07:55,404 --> 01:07:56,462
When you've got
too little time,

1092
01:07:56,539 --> 01:07:57,767
it's extraordinary
what you can do with it.

1093
01:07:57,840 --> 01:07:59,501
And when you've got
all the time in the world,

1094
01:07:59,575 --> 01:08:01,873
Iike us, you don't do
a damn thing.

1095
01:08:01,944 --> 01:08:05,607
That's it, doc, you're becoming
quite a philosopher in your old age.

1096
01:08:05,681 --> 01:08:08,343
Why not?. The war hasn't exactly
chosen us to be heroes.

1097
01:08:08,417 --> 01:08:11,250
I know exactly what
I'm going to do with my time right now.

1098
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:13,185
I'm going to climb
into my bunk

1099
01:08:13,255 --> 01:08:16,019
and do absolutely
nothing till supper.

1100
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:20,028
They're talking about
tiram for the derby this year.

1101
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:23,031
It'll be the fourth
derby I've missed.

1102
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:27,559
4 derbies. That's a hell
of a lot of time.

1103
01:08:27,636 --> 01:08:31,697
With nothing up
or down on the books to show for it.

1104
01:08:39,381 --> 01:08:42,350
Bloody leeks again
this year, Donny?.

1105
01:08:42,418 --> 01:08:44,886
I was thinking
of trying some asparagus.

1106
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:47,889
Asparagus?.
That takes 7 years a crop.

1107
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:49,219
Aye.

1108
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:51,384
I don't give it more
than another year myself.

1109
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:53,894
Another year?.

1110
01:08:53,963 --> 01:08:56,830
With it will be 4.

1111
01:08:56,899 --> 01:08:59,390
Flo's hair has gone
all white, she says.

1112
01:08:59,468 --> 01:09:01,402
Everything's changing.

1113
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:03,495
Do you think we'll
be able to pick it up?.

1114
01:09:03,572 --> 01:09:05,335
The business
and everything?.

1115
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:08,672
Search me. We're not
as young as we were, Donny.

1116
01:09:08,744 --> 01:09:12,373
No, Ted, we're not
as young as we were.

1117
01:09:15,684 --> 01:09:16,946
Surely they'll invade soon.

1118
01:09:17,019 --> 01:09:19,249
Yeah, that's what
you said last year.

1119
01:09:19,321 --> 01:09:20,754
And the year before.

1120
01:09:20,823 --> 01:09:22,415
What, it's the holiday list?.

1121
01:09:22,491 --> 01:09:25,756
Yeah, it's there
for all of us. 1 949.

1122
01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:28,695
I wrote that
for Caroline.

1123
01:09:28,764 --> 01:09:32,757
Somehow it expressed
what I felt when I first met her.

1124
01:09:32,835 --> 01:09:34,598
It was after a concert.

1125
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:36,103
There weren't any taxis.

1126
01:09:36,172 --> 01:09:38,470
We walked back
across the park.

1127
01:09:38,541 --> 01:09:40,236
After a bit,
it began to rain.

1128
01:09:40,309 --> 01:09:44,268
So I carried her
on my shoulders.

1129
01:09:44,346 --> 01:09:46,177
You're still in love
with her, aren't you?.

1130
01:09:46,248 --> 01:09:49,274
I've tried to shut her
out of my thoughts completely.

1131
01:09:49,351 --> 01:09:53,879
But I can't.
I long for her all the time.

1132
01:09:53,956 --> 01:09:57,119
I'm a bigger fool
than you are.

1133
01:09:57,193 --> 01:09:59,286
Falling in love
with a photograph.

1134
01:09:59,361 --> 01:10:01,454
A dream.

1135
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:06,092
And a home
in a strange land.

1136
01:10:06,168 --> 01:10:07,965
Achtung!

1137
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:09,971
Oh, carry on.

1138
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:12,269
Good afternoon,
gentlemen.

1139
01:10:12,341 --> 01:10:13,603
Oh, please,
do carry on.

1140
01:10:13,676 --> 01:10:16,304
Each time I visit
this camp,

1141
01:10:16,378 --> 01:10:18,471
I'm intrigued as
to where we met before.

1142
01:10:18,547 --> 01:10:20,412
But now I think
I know the answer.

1143
01:10:20,482 --> 01:10:24,145
Your name wasn't always
Geoffrey Mitchell.

1144
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:26,154
Your identification
photograph is being sent

1145
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:29,419
To Gestapo headquarters
in Berlin.

1146
01:10:29,491 --> 01:10:32,483
They have a large collection
of photographs there.

1147
01:10:32,561 --> 01:10:36,224
It will be interesting
to make comparisons.

1148
01:10:39,735 --> 01:10:41,293
I suppose it had to come.

1149
01:10:41,370 --> 01:10:43,861
They always catch up
with you in the end.

1150
01:10:43,939 --> 01:10:46,567
Repatriation, fellas!
Repatriation!

1151
01:10:48,377 --> 01:10:50,345
Great news, gentlemen,
great news! Repatriation!

1152
01:10:50,412 --> 01:10:52,539
And this time
it's the real McCoy.

1153
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:56,381
The thing that makes me mouth water,
real live girls.

1154
01:10:56,452 --> 01:10:58,010
Hundreds of 'em,
all lining up waiting for me.

1155
01:10:58,087 --> 01:11:02,183
Bipeds, old boy, furnished with
two of practically everything!

1156
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:05,125
A mixed German and Swiss
medical commission

1157
01:11:05,194 --> 01:11:08,527
will examine all those whose
names are down for repatriation.

1158
01:11:08,597 --> 01:11:12,192
Apparently it's a rush job,
so anybody who gets his ticket

1159
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:13,735
will leave in a week's time.

1160
01:11:13,802 --> 01:11:16,703
So you've got a chance.

1161
01:11:16,772 --> 01:11:18,364
Yes.

1162
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:21,534
But we must have positive evidence
to justify repatriation.

1163
01:11:21,610 --> 01:11:22,872
Of course.

1164
01:11:22,945 --> 01:11:25,038
Ah. Anything else,
Corporal?.

1165
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:27,048
Well, sir,
every time I breathe,

1166
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:29,607
I can feel me liver
knocking up against me kidneys.

1167
01:11:29,685 --> 01:11:32,210
Come here.

1168
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:33,550
Cough, please.

1169
01:11:33,622 --> 01:11:36,489
Cough?. Blimey, do you want me
to bring up my appendix?.

1170
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:39,784
Yah.

1171
01:11:44,533 --> 01:11:45,898
You have passed.

1172
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:47,230
Thank you, sir.

1173
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:48,292
Matthews.

1174
01:11:48,370 --> 01:11:50,304
I wonder if you'll
get through.

1175
01:11:50,372 --> 01:11:52,704
Hello, Evans.
You'll soon be seeing your youngster.

1176
01:11:52,775 --> 01:11:53,571
Yes, indeed.

1177
01:11:53,642 --> 01:11:55,405
I'm sorry to
hear about you

1178
01:11:55,477 --> 01:11:57,069
And Captain Grayson, sir.

1179
01:11:57,146 --> 01:11:59,171
Oh, well, the flat racing
season's over.

1180
01:11:59,248 --> 01:12:00,738
Do you know that Swiss fellow
actually had the nerve

1181
01:12:00,816 --> 01:12:02,249
to congratulate me
on my fitness.

1182
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:03,751
Ha ha! Well?.

1183
01:12:03,819 --> 01:12:05,548
- I got my ticket, all right.
- Fine.

1184
01:12:05,621 --> 01:12:07,213
You have passed.

1185
01:12:07,289 --> 01:12:09,382
Suits me, sir.

1186
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:14,258
Captain Mitchell.

1187
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:21,060
Ah.

1188
01:12:21,136 --> 01:12:23,934
You need not strip,
Captain Mitchell.

1189
01:12:24,006 --> 01:12:25,598
I regret your case
is deferred

1190
01:12:25,674 --> 01:12:29,337
until the next board
in 6 months' time.

1191
01:12:33,515 --> 01:12:34,948
Morris.

1192
01:12:35,017 --> 01:12:36,279
And once it's discovered
he's not Mitchell,

1193
01:12:36,352 --> 01:12:37,785
he's sunk.
They'll have no mercy.

1194
01:12:37,853 --> 01:12:39,286
We've got to
do something for him.

1195
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:40,583
Yes, but what?.

1196
01:12:40,656 --> 01:12:42,419
Excuse me, sir.
Can we put up a scheme to you?.

1197
01:12:42,491 --> 01:12:43,788
Sure. Sit down.

1198
01:12:43,859 --> 01:12:45,121
What's it all about?.

1199
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:46,627
We know the spot
Captain Mitchell's in.

1200
01:12:46,695 --> 01:12:48,754
We thought we'd fix up a stunt
to get him out of here.

1201
01:12:48,831 --> 01:12:50,298
What's the scheme?.

1202
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:51,890
Well, sir, there's
a list of bloke for repatriation

1203
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:53,127
In the commandant's office.

1204
01:12:53,202 --> 01:12:54,464
We thought if
we could get hold of it,

1205
01:12:54,536 --> 01:12:55,468
alter the names...

1206
01:12:55,537 --> 01:12:56,469
Stage a break-in, sir.

1207
01:12:56,538 --> 01:12:57,630
Hear, hear, hold on.

1208
01:12:57,706 --> 01:12:58,798
We aren't professional burglars.

1209
01:12:58,874 --> 01:13:00,136
Well, yes, sir,
as a matter of fact,

1210
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:01,301
well, I was.

1211
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:04,403
Were you really?.
Well, how awfully interesting.

1212
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:06,812
Commandant's office--
only one wire to cut.

1213
01:13:06,882 --> 01:13:09,043
Yes, but what about
the perimeter lights?.

1214
01:13:09,118 --> 01:13:10,483
They always put them out
when there's an air raid.

1215
01:13:10,552 --> 01:13:12,884
And they've been as
regular as clockwork lately.

1216
01:13:12,955 --> 01:13:14,479
Gosh, I believe
we've got something.

1217
01:13:14,556 --> 01:13:15,648
Suppose we do
get the list. What then?.

1218
01:13:15,724 --> 01:13:16,986
I can type.

1219
01:13:17,059 --> 01:13:18,321
Scratch out one of
the names beginning with M

1220
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:19,486
and type Mitchell's
on instead.

1221
01:13:19,561 --> 01:13:20,653
Just a minute.
Don't you see,

1222
01:13:20,729 --> 01:13:23,425
the chap whose name goes off
has to stay behind.

1223
01:13:23,499 --> 01:13:25,831
Well, uh, my name
begins with M, sir.

1224
01:13:25,901 --> 01:13:28,802
You'd really give up
your ticket home?.

1225
01:13:28,871 --> 01:13:30,395
Why not?.

1226
01:13:30,472 --> 01:13:31,996
But I thought
all the girls were lining up

1227
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:33,166
for you to come home?.

1228
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:34,903
Well, so they are.

1229
01:13:34,977 --> 01:13:36,069
But they'll wait.

1230
01:13:36,145 --> 01:13:37,669
You are a sportsman.

1231
01:13:37,746 --> 01:13:39,338
Gentleman,
we'll have a snack.

1232
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:42,509
Now, as I see it,
the drill is this...

1233
01:14:13,782 --> 01:14:17,718
My eyes are clear,
I cannot see

1234
01:14:17,786 --> 01:14:22,280
I have not brought my--

1235
01:14:28,697 --> 01:14:30,392
Here come the boys.
Bang on the dot.

1236
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:31,558
What do you mean?.

1237
01:14:31,633 --> 01:14:33,123
Well, just another raid,
old boy.

1238
01:14:35,137 --> 01:14:37,731
All right, chaps,
lights out and sing out.

1239
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:52,420
Well, they had
better start.

1240
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:55,651
I know. God bless
the R.A. F.

1241
01:15:04,066 --> 01:15:05,055
Here he is.

1242
01:15:05,133 --> 01:15:07,192
Good boy.
Look out!

1243
01:15:58,687 --> 01:16:00,848
All clear.

1244
01:16:49,204 --> 01:16:51,468
That's the lock
you've got to pick.

1245
01:16:57,446 --> 01:16:59,038
Good, there's a typewriter.

1246
01:16:59,114 --> 01:17:00,706
Get down!

1247
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:04,715
Type on the floor.

1248
01:17:06,054 --> 01:17:07,885
It's tougher than I thought.

1249
01:17:07,956 --> 01:17:09,583
Let me try.

1250
01:17:14,463 --> 01:17:16,055
Must be a bit out of practice.

1251
01:17:16,131 --> 01:17:17,155
I'll say.

1252
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:23,904
Good, this is it.

1253
01:17:48,897 --> 01:17:51,991
Sing, you so-and-sos, sing!

1254
01:17:59,107 --> 01:18:01,166
- That'll do.
- Come on.

1255
01:18:27,669 --> 01:18:28,795
That'll fool 'em.

1256
01:18:28,870 --> 01:18:31,304
Let's split up and get back
to our own huts.

1257
01:18:31,373 --> 01:18:32,362
Ok, sir.

1258
01:18:52,728 --> 01:18:53,660
What's going on?.

1259
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:54,991
You're not supposed
to know.

1260
01:18:55,063 --> 01:18:56,325
The boys were out there
putting your name

1261
01:18:56,398 --> 01:18:57,387
on the repatriation list.

1262
01:19:21,156 --> 01:19:22,521
Darn.

1263
01:19:44,279 --> 01:19:48,306
You will all remain here
until the other huts have been checked!

1264
01:20:09,905 --> 01:20:11,395
Permission to go home, sir?.

1265
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:15,603
Yes, provided you put
a... for me.

1266
01:20:15,677 --> 01:20:17,076
It's you that ought
to be going home.

1267
01:20:17,145 --> 01:20:19,010
Oh, don't you believe it.

1268
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:20,809
I'm a social parasite.

1269
01:20:20,882 --> 01:20:22,873
The sort we're fighting
to get rid of.

1270
01:20:22,951 --> 01:20:24,441
That's right.
I've got to stay here

1271
01:20:24,519 --> 01:20:25,451
and exterminate him.

1272
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:27,750
Ha ha.
Go slow with the...

1273
01:20:27,823 --> 01:20:29,051
Don't forget
to save a couple of

1274
01:20:29,124 --> 01:20:30,853
peach-fed blondes
for your Uncle Jim.

1275
01:20:30,926 --> 01:20:31,858
That's a promise.

1276
01:20:31,927 --> 01:20:33,417
Oh, I was kidding.

1277
01:20:33,495 --> 01:20:35,929
You're one of those
one-woman blokes, aren't you?.

1278
01:20:35,997 --> 01:20:37,521
Yes, that's my trouble.

1279
01:20:37,599 --> 01:20:39,760
Sorry, then.
Always putting my foot in it.

1280
01:20:39,835 --> 01:20:41,393
Don't forget to tell the girls round
Hammersmith Way

1281
01:20:41,469 --> 01:20:43,061
that I'll be home
soon and I've got

1282
01:20:43,138 --> 01:20:44,469
plenty saved up
to give them a treat with.

1283
01:20:44,539 --> 01:20:45,506
Yeah, you bet.

1284
01:20:45,574 --> 01:20:47,201
I'm gonna keep
my job warm for you.

1285
01:20:47,275 --> 01:20:49,175
Horsfall, Evans,
and Mathews.

1286
01:20:49,244 --> 01:20:50,302
Unlimited.

1287
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:55,546
Hello, Mathews.
Feeling all right?.

1288
01:20:55,617 --> 01:20:56,743
Yes, it's all right, sir.

1289
01:20:56,818 --> 01:20:58,683
I was a sissy
passing out like that.

1290
01:20:58,753 --> 01:21:00,550
I can never thank you
for what you've done.

1291
01:21:00,622 --> 01:21:02,613
Well, forget it. Just keep your head
down on the parade

1292
01:21:02,691 --> 01:21:03,817
And pop your uncle.

1293
01:21:03,892 --> 01:21:05,723
- Thanks.
- Don't worry, sir.

1294
01:21:05,794 --> 01:21:07,022
You'll get through all right.

1295
01:21:07,095 --> 01:21:08,585
We'll be right
behind you, sir.

1296
01:21:12,167 --> 01:21:14,965
One other thing.
What about the German M.O.?.

1297
01:21:15,036 --> 01:21:16,060
He's certain
to be on parade,

1298
01:21:16,137 --> 01:21:17,661
and he's more likely
than anyone

1299
01:21:17,739 --> 01:21:19,400
To remember that
Mitchell's name wasn't on the list.

1300
01:21:19,474 --> 01:21:20,941
I know.
I've thought of that.

1301
01:21:21,009 --> 01:21:22,601
I'm going to start up
a conversation with him

1302
01:21:22,677 --> 01:21:23,974
while they're
calling the names.

1303
01:21:24,045 --> 01:21:25,910
He only speaks
about a dozen words in English.

1304
01:21:25,981 --> 01:21:27,573
You leave it to me.

1305
01:21:27,649 --> 01:21:29,742
Hello, David, my boy.

1306
01:21:29,818 --> 01:21:33,185
Good-bye
and good luck.

1307
01:21:33,255 --> 01:21:37,055
Good-bye, sir,
and thank you all.

1308
01:21:37,125 --> 01:21:39,320
See you again before
you know where you are.

1309
01:21:39,394 --> 01:21:42,056
- Yes.
- Come on, David.

1310
01:21:42,130 --> 01:21:43,927
Don't forget.
We've got a bridge date tonight.

1311
01:21:43,999 --> 01:21:45,830
Don't forget the cigarettes
you owe me, padre.

1312
01:21:45,901 --> 01:21:47,459
Play you a double
at quits tonight, jim.

1313
01:21:47,535 --> 01:21:48,695
Ambrose.

1314
01:21:50,205 --> 01:21:51,297
Anderson.

1315
01:21:52,841 --> 01:21:54,866
Burns.

1316
01:21:54,943 --> 01:21:58,174
There are a lot of
things I'd like to say, but--

1317
01:21:58,246 --> 01:21:59,406
But I can't.

1318
01:21:59,481 --> 01:22:02,416
Go on.
Off you go.

1319
01:22:02,484 --> 01:22:05,180
Good-bye.
Good luck.

1320
01:22:05,253 --> 01:22:07,380
- So long, old boy.
- Good luck.

1321
01:22:07,455 --> 01:22:09,389
Keep out of
the German M.O.'s eyeline.

1322
01:22:10,692 --> 01:22:12,159
Grant.

1323
01:22:13,428 --> 01:22:14,554
Hanley.

1324
01:22:16,031 --> 01:22:17,123
Hunt.

1325
01:22:18,633 --> 01:22:21,033
Horsfall.

1326
01:22:21,102 --> 01:22:22,433
Jackson.

1327
01:22:23,738 --> 01:22:25,069
Jessop.

1328
01:22:26,508 --> 01:22:28,772
How soon do you think
the war will end now, doctor?.

1329
01:22:28,843 --> 01:22:31,437
6 months or one year
if you're light.

1330
01:22:31,513 --> 01:22:33,378
By then, you'll be
speaking fluent English.

1331
01:22:33,448 --> 01:22:35,382
You think I've made
good progression?.

1332
01:22:35,450 --> 01:22:37,350
Oh, terrific.
Ha ha.

1333
01:22:37,419 --> 01:22:38,351
Yes, you Germans
certainly have

1334
01:22:38,420 --> 01:22:39,387
the gift for languages.

1335
01:22:39,454 --> 01:22:40,421
You think so.

1336
01:22:40,488 --> 01:22:42,479
Of course.
Yes. Ha ha.

1337
01:22:42,557 --> 01:22:44,388
After the war,
they make me

1338
01:22:44,459 --> 01:22:46,188
headmaster of
Oxford University.

1339
01:22:48,063 --> 01:22:49,189
Mitchell.

1340
01:22:53,368 --> 01:22:54,392
Miter.

1341
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:01,702
Acton. Ashe.

1342
01:24:03,471 --> 01:24:08,033
For the gang's all here

1343
01:24:35,003 --> 01:24:37,130
I'm sorry, madam,
but you can't go in.

1344
01:24:37,205 --> 01:24:38,832
I must.
It's my husband.

1345
01:24:38,907 --> 01:24:39,896
Please.

1346
01:25:49,244 --> 01:25:50,643
Excuse me.

1347
01:25:52,747 --> 01:25:54,044
Excuse me.

1348
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:13,731
What's happened to
the iron gate, Mother?.

1349
01:26:13,801 --> 01:26:16,827
It went for salvage
2 years ago.

1350
01:26:16,905 --> 01:26:18,736
I'll miss the squeaking
of that old gate.

1351
01:26:20,241 --> 01:26:21,708
Have there been
any other changes?.

1352
01:26:21,776 --> 01:26:24,836
No. I kept your room
exactly as it was

1353
01:26:24,913 --> 01:26:26,437
the day you went off
to France.

1354
01:26:29,384 --> 01:26:32,148
Same old smell.

1355
01:26:32,220 --> 01:26:34,381
Sunlight, soap,
and furniture polish.

1356
01:26:35,757 --> 01:26:37,816
You come in here
for a minute

1357
01:26:37,892 --> 01:26:39,792
and I'll get you
something to eat.

1358
01:26:48,670 --> 01:26:49,967
David.

1359
01:26:51,706 --> 01:26:52,934
Elspeth.

1360
01:26:55,610 --> 01:26:57,305
That last letter.

1361
01:26:58,813 --> 01:27:00,576
Your mother showed me.

1362
01:27:00,648 --> 01:27:04,106
Telling the truth
about your eyes.

1363
01:27:04,185 --> 01:27:05,880
So that was the reason.

1364
01:27:05,954 --> 01:27:08,149
The reason for what?.

1365
01:27:08,223 --> 01:27:10,191
For breaking
our engagement.

1366
01:27:10,258 --> 01:27:12,658
But you can't go on
being engaged

1367
01:27:12,727 --> 01:27:14,627
when you're not
in love any longer.

1368
01:27:14,696 --> 01:27:16,721
You can't go on breaking
a person's heart

1369
01:27:16,798 --> 01:27:19,358
to satisfy your own
stupid pride.

1370
01:27:19,434 --> 01:27:21,197
I'm not prepared
to discuss the matter.

1371
01:27:21,269 --> 01:27:24,705
Neither am l.
David...

1372
01:27:26,140 --> 01:27:29,701
Why did you have to make me
so dreadfully unhappy?.

1373
01:27:59,607 --> 01:28:00,699
Caroline.

1374
01:28:02,477 --> 01:28:04,536
But--but what are you--

1375
01:28:04,612 --> 01:28:06,341
There were some things
I left behind.

1376
01:28:08,049 --> 01:28:09,778
Caretaker let me in.

1377
01:28:09,851 --> 01:28:11,546
I had no idea.

1378
01:28:14,989 --> 01:28:16,081
I'll go now.

1379
01:28:18,159 --> 01:28:19,820
Caroline.

1380
01:28:19,894 --> 01:28:21,691
Yes, Stephen?.

1381
01:28:21,763 --> 01:28:23,993
Are you all right?.

1382
01:28:27,168 --> 01:28:28,567
Why are you crying?.

1383
01:28:30,438 --> 01:28:32,736
Because I'm a fool.

1384
01:28:32,807 --> 01:28:35,776
Are you unhappy
with Robert?.

1385
01:28:37,278 --> 01:28:38,711
I'm not with Robert.

1386
01:28:40,415 --> 01:28:41,677
Oh, Stephen.

1387
01:28:42,884 --> 01:28:44,818
Why did you have to
believe that idiot?.

1388
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:49,017
It wasn't true?.
It wasn't true?.

1389
01:28:49,090 --> 01:28:51,650
No. Not then.

1390
01:28:52,660 --> 01:28:53,684
Go on.

1391
01:28:54,696 --> 01:28:56,129
When I got your letter,
it was as if

1392
01:28:56,197 --> 01:28:59,064
all I'd ever believed in
didn't exist anymore.

1393
01:28:59,133 --> 01:29:01,226
I didn't care
what happened.

1394
01:29:01,302 --> 01:29:02,894
He was in love
with you?.

1395
01:29:02,970 --> 01:29:04,369
Yes.

1396
01:29:04,439 --> 01:29:05,497
And you?.

1397
01:29:06,641 --> 01:29:07,630
No.

1398
01:29:09,344 --> 01:29:10,834
Let me go now.
Please.

1399
01:29:13,081 --> 01:29:14,639
Listen, Caroline.

1400
01:29:14,716 --> 01:29:16,877
There, everything
seemed so--

1401
01:29:16,951 --> 01:29:18,919
so out of proportion.

1402
01:29:18,986 --> 01:29:20,920
I think I was mad
for a bit.

1403
01:29:20,988 --> 01:29:23,855
You see, I loved you
so desperately.

1404
01:29:23,925 --> 01:29:25,790
Still do.

1405
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:27,384
Always shall.

1406
01:29:27,462 --> 01:29:28,451
Stephen.

1407
01:29:42,610 --> 01:29:43,599
Thanks, mate.

1408
01:29:46,547 --> 01:29:47,536
Thanks.

1409
01:29:47,615 --> 01:29:49,378
Well, this is it, Don.

1410
01:29:49,450 --> 01:29:50,474
Yes.

1411
01:29:50,551 --> 01:29:51,483
How do you feel?.

1412
01:29:51,552 --> 01:29:53,645
Empty.
Empty inside.

1413
01:29:53,721 --> 01:29:56,519
Me, too, like it wasn't me
standing here at all.

1414
01:29:56,591 --> 01:29:58,354
Come on, Don.
Let's get weaving.

1415
01:30:16,144 --> 01:30:17,133
Hello, old girl.

1416
01:30:18,513 --> 01:30:19,502
Hello, Ted.

1417
01:30:21,616 --> 01:30:23,049
Doing you all right?.

1418
01:30:24,452 --> 01:30:25,680
I'm seasick.

1419
01:30:26,921 --> 01:30:29,185
Stomach always was
your weakness.

1420
01:30:33,828 --> 01:30:35,523
Suits you.

1421
01:30:35,596 --> 01:30:36,858
Oh, Ted.

1422
01:30:36,931 --> 01:30:38,159
There, there.

1423
01:30:39,434 --> 01:30:41,959
I can't leave don out
in the cold like that.

1424
01:30:42,970 --> 01:30:44,096
Oh, don.

1425
01:30:44,172 --> 01:30:45,104
Hello, flo.

1426
01:30:45,173 --> 01:30:46,765
Oh, it's lovely
to see you.

1427
01:30:46,841 --> 01:30:48,035
Come on in.

1428
01:30:54,148 --> 01:30:55,672
- Where is she?.
- In here.

1429
01:31:13,734 --> 01:31:14,826
Hello, Gwyneth.

1430
01:31:14,902 --> 01:31:16,267
Hello.

1431
01:31:16,337 --> 01:31:17,634
Do you know who I am?.

1432
01:31:17,705 --> 01:31:19,332
Yes. You're my
Daddy, aren't you?.

1433
01:31:19,407 --> 01:31:22,274
That's it.
Look.

1434
01:31:22,343 --> 01:31:24,402
I made this in
the prison camp for you.

1435
01:31:26,414 --> 01:31:27,972
Can she shut her eyes?.

1436
01:31:28,049 --> 01:31:29,414
No, she can't.

1437
01:31:30,885 --> 01:31:32,375
My doll can.

1438
01:31:32,453 --> 01:31:33,681
She's lovely.

1439
01:31:38,793 --> 01:31:39,817
So that's settled.

1440
01:31:39,894 --> 01:31:41,384
Captain Hasek
reports to duty

1441
01:31:41,462 --> 01:31:43,327
to Czech headquarters.

1442
01:31:43,397 --> 01:31:45,991
There was something
I wanted to ask, sir.

1443
01:31:46,067 --> 01:31:47,056
About Mrs. Mitchell.

1444
01:31:47,134 --> 01:31:48,931
Oh, yes.
Very awkward, of course.

1445
01:31:49,003 --> 01:31:50,334
Don't worry, Captain Hasek.

1446
01:31:50,404 --> 01:31:52,304
We've got that
matter in hand.

1447
01:31:52,373 --> 01:31:53,533
I wanted
to suggest, sir,

1448
01:31:53,608 --> 01:31:54,734
as it's my responsibility,

1449
01:31:54,809 --> 01:31:57,676
that if the notification
of her husband's death

1450
01:31:57,745 --> 01:31:59,906
could be delayed until I've seen
Mrs. Mitchell myself.

1451
01:31:59,981 --> 01:32:02,211
She'll have to be told through
the usual channels, you know.

1452
01:32:02,283 --> 01:32:04,046
Yes, sir, but in
a case like this, it's--

1453
01:32:04,118 --> 01:32:06,086
War office will
look after it.

1454
01:32:06,153 --> 01:32:08,121
Or if you like,
go down and see her yourself.

1455
01:32:08,189 --> 01:32:09,486
There's nothing
to stop you.

1456
01:32:09,557 --> 01:32:10,581
I see.

1457
01:32:11,926 --> 01:32:12,915
Thank you, sir.

1458
01:32:18,199 --> 01:32:19,291
Looks like rain.

1459
01:32:21,669 --> 01:32:25,969
My dear.
It's no good going on hoping.

1460
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:27,371
You must face up to it.

1461
01:32:29,310 --> 01:32:31,073
That he won't come back?.

1462
01:32:31,145 --> 01:32:32,578
That he won't come back.

1463
01:32:38,486 --> 01:32:40,545
Grandpa. It's
starting to rain.

1464
01:32:40,621 --> 01:32:42,987
Come help me put the chairs
in the summer house.

1465
01:32:43,057 --> 01:32:44,524
Oh, come on.

1466
01:33:01,909 --> 01:33:02,898
Oh.

1467
01:33:04,078 --> 01:33:07,741
I'm sorry.
I was expecting someone else.

1468
01:33:07,815 --> 01:33:09,305
Mrs. Mitchell,
I came to see you.

1469
01:33:09,383 --> 01:33:12,045
I have some news for you,

1470
01:33:12,119 --> 01:33:13,143
of your husband.

1471
01:33:15,723 --> 01:33:16,712
Oh.

1472
01:33:17,959 --> 01:33:18,948
Come in, please.

1473
01:33:29,704 --> 01:33:30,693
What?.

1474
01:33:33,140 --> 01:33:34,334
Your husband is dead.

1475
01:33:37,278 --> 01:33:38,267
Dead?.

1476
01:33:39,747 --> 01:33:41,146
He was killed 4 years ago

1477
01:33:41,215 --> 01:33:43,445
in the fighting at Saint-Ardennie.

1478
01:33:43,517 --> 01:33:46,953
I heard from him.
From the prison camp.

1479
01:33:48,222 --> 01:33:50,520
Your husband was never
in that prison camp.

1480
01:33:50,591 --> 01:33:52,616
He was never
a prisoner of war.

1481
01:33:52,693 --> 01:33:54,888
But--the letters.

1482
01:33:54,962 --> 01:33:56,759
I wrote those letters.

1483
01:33:58,699 --> 01:33:59,791
You?.

1484
01:33:59,867 --> 01:34:00,856
Yes.

1485
01:34:03,104 --> 01:34:04,765
But l--

1486
01:34:04,839 --> 01:34:06,807
I took these from
your husband's body.

1487
01:34:06,874 --> 01:34:10,674
I took his name,
his uniform, his identity.

1488
01:34:12,213 --> 01:34:15,979
For 4 years, I've been
Geoffrey Mitchell.

1489
01:34:21,055 --> 01:34:22,044
But why?.

1490
01:34:23,658 --> 01:34:24,852
To save my life.

1491
01:34:24,925 --> 01:34:26,256
The Germans
were after me.

1492
01:34:27,495 --> 01:34:28,689
The letters?.

1493
01:34:28,763 --> 01:34:30,196
Later in the camp,
I had to write.

1494
01:34:30,264 --> 01:34:31,731
They suspected me.

1495
01:34:31,799 --> 01:34:32,823
If I hadn't answered
your letters,

1496
01:34:32,900 --> 01:34:34,800
they'd have been
on to me.

1497
01:34:34,869 --> 01:34:37,064
You had to answer
my letters.

1498
01:34:37,138 --> 01:34:38,799
I understand that.
You--

1499
01:34:39,907 --> 01:34:42,000
You even had
to go on writing.

1500
01:34:42,076 --> 01:34:43,509
I understand that, too.

1501
01:34:46,213 --> 01:34:48,511
Why did you have
to write the way you did?.

1502
01:34:51,652 --> 01:34:54,143
I believed
every word you said.

1503
01:34:54,221 --> 01:34:56,781
At first, I had
to make you tell me

1504
01:34:56,857 --> 01:34:58,256
as much as possible
about yourself.

1505
01:34:59,493 --> 01:35:00,721
I was fighting
for my life.

1506
01:35:02,663 --> 01:35:03,721
And then...

1507
01:35:05,900 --> 01:35:07,868
I got your other letters.

1508
01:35:07,935 --> 01:35:09,527
Photos of the children.

1509
01:35:12,907 --> 01:35:15,171
Glimpses of things lost
to me forever and...

1510
01:35:16,844 --> 01:35:19,938
It was as if you were
offering me a new world.

1511
01:35:23,350 --> 01:35:25,682
It was easy out there
to delude oneself.

1512
01:35:27,188 --> 01:35:29,383
And I believed
a wonderful thing had happened.

1513
01:35:30,725 --> 01:35:32,124
My husband had left me.

1514
01:35:32,193 --> 01:35:36,596
And those letters made me believe
he was mine again,

1515
01:35:36,664 --> 01:35:39,098
That everything would be
as I'd hoped it would be.

1516
01:35:40,935 --> 01:35:43,130
I planned for the day
he'd come home again...

1517
01:35:44,672 --> 01:35:46,105
For a new life together.

1518
01:35:49,143 --> 01:35:50,838
What a fool I was.

1519
01:35:51,946 --> 01:35:53,038
You were still
in love with him?.

1520
01:35:55,015 --> 01:35:56,915
How I can tell now?.

1521
01:35:58,619 --> 01:36:00,917
I know there's no excuse
for what I did, but--

1522
01:36:00,988 --> 01:36:03,752
Will you go now, please?.

1523
01:36:03,824 --> 01:36:07,123
You must believe that
I meant what I wrote.

1524
01:36:07,194 --> 01:36:10,288
Your letters came
to be my life.

1525
01:36:10,364 --> 01:36:13,356
You see, I fell
in love with you.

1526
01:36:14,401 --> 01:36:19,168
It was a dream then.
Now it's reality.

1527
01:37:04,752 --> 01:37:06,151
I allowed myself to dream

1528
01:37:06,220 --> 01:37:09,314
these letters of ours
could come to life.

1529
01:37:09,390 --> 01:37:12,154
That I could see with my own
eyes your home,

1530
01:37:12,226 --> 01:37:15,354
the children, yourself.

1531
01:37:58,906 --> 01:38:01,773
Celia, you're wanted
on the telephone.

1532
01:38:01,842 --> 01:38:03,002
Who is it?.

1533
01:38:03,077 --> 01:38:04,510
Captain Hasek.
