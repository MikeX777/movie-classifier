1
00:00:27,928 --> 00:00:30,396
<i>Call me anyone.</i>

2
00:00:30,398 --> 00:00:35,501
<i>I am one of the six billion
people alive on this planet.</i>

3
00:00:36,971 --> 00:00:39,471
<i>My age isn't important.</i>

4
00:00:40,107 --> 00:00:42,641
<i>My race doesn't matter.</i>

5
00:00:42,743 --> 00:00:45,277
<i>My sex doesn't, either.</i>

6
00:00:46,414 --> 00:00:49,982
<i>All you need to know</i>
<i>is that I tell stories.</i>

7
00:00:49,984 --> 00:00:55,320
<i>And I tell them because stories
create the world we live in.</i>

8
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,124
<i>Everything is a story.</i>

9
00:00:59,193 --> 00:01:01,927
<i>History, faith,</i>

10
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:05,264
<i>country, even God.</i>

11
00:01:07,802 --> 00:01:10,335
<i>Each of us has a story.</i>

12
00:01:10,504 --> 00:01:14,373
<i>Each of us is a character</i>
<i>in someone else's story.</i>

13
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:19,578
<i>You might even say we're all
part of the same story.</i>

14
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:26,418
<i>This is someone</i>
<i>who also tells stories.</i>

15
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,920
<i>His name is Dan Brown,</i>

16
00:01:27,922 --> 00:01:31,824
<i>and in the spring of 2003,</i>
<i>he published a book</i>

17
00:01:31,826 --> 00:01:36,428
<i>that became the fastest-selling
adult novel in history.</i>

18
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:40,132
<i>Why did</i> The Da Vinci Code
<i>generate such passion?</i>

19
00:01:40,134 --> 00:01:43,936
<i>Why did it spark</i>
<i>such controversy?</i>

20
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:45,938
<i>Why this book? Why now?</i>

21
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,773
Dan Brown has done a service
to the debates

22
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:50,109
by bringing things
like the Divine Feminine,

23
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:53,645
the Sacred Feminine, back into
public discourse, if you like.

24
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:55,581
It's the theological
equivalent of junk food.

25
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:58,317
The <i> Da Vinci Code</i>
gives us this kind of fantasy,

26
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:01,753
to imagine our relationships
on a personal level

27
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:02,488
can be like Jesus and Mary.

28
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,257
<i>The whole thing</i>
<i>is a litany of lies,</i>

29
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:08,861
'cause I think he wins the
Guinness Book of Records prize

30
00:02:08,863 --> 00:02:10,662
for the number of mistakes

31
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:12,931
historically
that are made in a novel.

32
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:16,568
If you don't learn about Isaac
Newton in your science class,

33
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:18,403
and then your first encounter
with the fellow

34
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:21,573
is from having read <i> The Da
Vinci Code,</i> I'll take it.

35
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:24,943
<i>The Da Vinci Code</i> has done
the world an enormous favor,

36
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:26,745
um, and I think
it's the beginning of hope.

37
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:29,815
If you want to learn about early
Christianity, don't read <i> The Da Vinci Code,</i>

38
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:33,852
read a book about the history of early
Christianity and get your facts straight.

39
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:39,191
My own sister came to me and said,
"I just read <i> The Da Vinci Code.</i>

40
00:02:39,193 --> 00:02:41,760
"I didn't know
all those things."

41
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:42,628
And I looked at her and I said,

42
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,663
"Hey, you still
don't know all those things."

43
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:51,837
It's become a launching pad for attacking
basic Christian beliefs and an institution

44
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:53,872
within the Catholic Church.
In this case Opus Dei.

45
00:02:53,874 --> 00:03:01,180
The fear of meaninglessness coupled with
disillusionment about the various isms

46
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:04,049
has generated
a spiritual hunger.

47
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:08,253
A very broad swath of humanity
simply does not find

48
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:09,588
the Church's version
of events credible.

49
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:13,892
It shows that there are thousands and
thousands of people who're prepared to hear

50
00:03:13,894 --> 00:03:18,130
something different and who are trained
to find by themselves, the truth.

51
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:22,367
The great thing about <i> The Da Vinci
Code</i> is it shows people are looking.

52
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,403
And my hope is that
they'll keep looking.

53
00:03:24,405 --> 00:03:27,806
They'll look through <i> The Da Vinci
Code</i> and find something deeper.

54
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:30,976
<i>So</i> The Da Vinci Code
<i>touches these raw nerves</i>

55
00:03:30,978 --> 00:03:35,914
<i>about secret knowledge, about
sacred knowledge, the quest</i>

56
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:37,316
<i>to find out these truths,</i>

57
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:39,818
<i>about why certain people</i>
<i>are on a mission</i>

58
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,421
<i>to find these truths, and
certain people are on a mission</i>

59
00:03:42,423 --> 00:03:46,792
to preserve these truths, and why
other people are on a mission

60
00:03:46,794 --> 00:03:49,528
to cover up or conceal
these truths.

61
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:01,373
The Da Vinci Code
<i>begins with a murder</i>

62
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:04,243
<i>at the Louvre museum in Paris.</i>

63
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:04,843
<i>Before dying,</i>

64
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:07,613
<i>the victim arranges</i>
<i>his arms and legs</i>

65
00:04:07,615 --> 00:04:09,481
<i>to look like a pentacle.</i>

66
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:11,450
<i>Like this.</i>

67
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,118
<i>Or this.</i>

68
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,052
<i>The pose is a clue.</i>

69
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:19,091
<i>It's the first of many clues that
send Harvard professor Robert Langdon</i>

70
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:21,593
<i>and French cryptologist</i>
<i>Sophie Neveu</i>

71
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:26,265
<i>on a 24-hour high-speed chase</i>
<i>across Europe.</i>

72
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:32,537
<i>Paintings that lead to a chateau
on the outskirts of Paris,</i>

73
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:35,107
<i>a 13th century church in London</i>

74
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:37,676
<i>built by Templar Knights,</i>

75
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:38,744
<i>a chapel in Scotland</i>

76
00:04:38,746 --> 00:04:42,414
<i>where the Holy Grail</i>
<i>is said to rest.</i>

77
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:43,515
<i>Langdon and Neveu</i>

78
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:46,818
<i>are closing in on a secret</i>
<i>that has been concealed</i>

79
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:52,057
<i>by the Catholic Church</i>
<i>for nearly 2000 years.</i>

80
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:53,425
<i>A secret so disturbing,</i>

81
00:04:53,427 --> 00:04:55,494
<i>it could change our view</i>
<i>of history,</i>

82
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:59,398
<i>and perhaps,</i>
<i>of Christianity itself.</i>

83
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:02,668
So in the book, they tell you
something very important.

84
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:05,070
Jesus had a female companion,
Mary Magdalene...

85
00:05:05,072 --> 00:05:08,407
and they have descendants
remaining until today.

86
00:05:08,409 --> 00:05:09,875
<i>According to the novel,</i>

87
00:05:09,877 --> 00:05:13,011
<i>Mary Magdalene is not</i>
<i>the penitent prostitute</i>

88
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:13,979
<i>the Church led us to believe.</i>

89
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:17,649
<i>A prostitute who finds</i>
<i>redemption through Christ.</i>

90
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:21,486
<i>No, she is the most trusted</i>
<i>apostle of Jesus,</i>

91
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:27,125
<i>his closest companion,</i>
<i>and the mother of his child.</i>

92
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:29,761
<i>Her spirit is</i>
<i>the Sacred Feminine,</i>

93
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:32,297
<i>and her body the Holy Grail.</i>

94
00:05:32,299 --> 00:05:36,601
<i>And apparently,</i>
<i>she has gone missing.</i>

95
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:41,440
So you see in the very center
of this commercial gallery

96
00:05:41,442 --> 00:05:46,211
is located very strange sculpture
consisting in two opposite shapes.

97
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:51,283
One is the normal pyramid, what we call
the Blade, which is mentioned to be

98
00:05:51,285 --> 00:05:53,385
the Blade of the male sign
in the book,

99
00:05:53,387 --> 00:05:55,887
and we have an
inverted pyramid in glass

100
00:05:55,889 --> 00:06:00,125
which is in the book mentioned
to be the female sign.

101
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:00,992
Is it the Grail or is it

102
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:07,232
the testimony of Jesus and Magdalene's descendants?
But that's the place.

103
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:09,568
<i>This is where the novel ends</i>

104
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,569
<i>and our story begins.</i>

105
00:06:10,571 --> 00:06:14,339
Of course, I mean it's a strange place
because you are in the center of

106
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:17,109
a commercial gallery, you're close to
Virgin Megastore, amongst the shops

107
00:06:17,111 --> 00:06:21,012
it's very modern, but sometimes,
I mean, we are living in

108
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:26,084
the 3rd millennium and sometimes
we are looking for things

109
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:27,052
in unexpected places...

110
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:31,590
Maybe the Grail is close
to us and we don't see.

111
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:41,767
<i>For me one of the worst things</i>
<i>I could imagine</i>

112
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:43,835
<i>would be to open my newspaper</i>
<i>in the morning,</i>

113
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:47,272
<i>and see a big headline saying,</i>
<i>"Holy Grail discovered."</i>

114
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:48,273
<i>Because if it's</i>
<i>been discovered,</i>

115
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:50,942
<i>then there's nothing left</i>
<i>to search for.</i>

116
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:53,311
The real mystery is... is
somewhere inside.

117
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:58,817
And you come to it by making
the journey, by exploring.

118
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:02,454
<i>We have people basically who are much
more interested in treasure hunting.</i>

119
00:07:02,456 --> 00:07:06,291
They're looking for a chalice,
they're looking for a cauldron,

120
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:08,593
they're looking
for a bloodline.

121
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,028
For me, it wouldn't be
the Grail

122
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,863
because it's what
the Grail stands for,

123
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:15,033
what it represents,
what it contains, if you like,

124
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:15,934
that's much more important.

125
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:19,204
But I am interested in finding
the truth behind the myths,

126
00:07:19,206 --> 00:07:21,973
behind the stories,
behind the mystery,

127
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:23,508
and I think one of the ways
that you can do that

128
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:26,978
is to dig back far enough.
If you go back far enough,

129
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:30,882
it's not necessary that you're
gonna find an absolute truth

130
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:32,951
if you go back
to pre-historic times,

131
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:37,489
but you are going to be closer to the
earliest expression of these things,

132
00:07:37,491 --> 00:07:41,626
to the... to the idea, when the
idea was born, if you like.

133
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:44,062
<i>Like the characters</i>
<i>in</i> The Da Vinci Code,

134
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:46,431
<i>we, too, are looking</i>
<i>for a Grail.</i>

135
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:48,433
<i>Not the cup</i>
<i>from which Jesus drank</i>

136
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:52,137
<i>or proof of a bloodline
descending from Jesus and Mary.</i>

137
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,539
<i>Nothing that we can see</i>
<i>or touch.</i>

138
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,875
<i>But something</i>
<i>in the heart and mind,</i>

139
00:07:56,877 --> 00:07:59,945
<i>and in the stories</i>
<i>that define us.</i>

140
00:07:59,947 --> 00:08:03,582
<i>We are seekers</i>
<i>traveling down unknown roads,</i>

141
00:08:03,584 --> 00:08:06,384
<i>looking for answers</i>
<i>to ancient questions,</i>

142
00:08:06,386 --> 00:08:09,020
<i>going back to a time</i>
<i>when religion was new,</i>

143
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:12,757
<i>and the Sacred Feminine</i>
<i>was just evolving,</i>

144
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:13,992
<i>25,000 years ago,</i>

145
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:17,362
<i>when our ancestors</i>
<i>worshiped many gods,</i>

146
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:20,165
<i>male and female.</i>

147
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:28,073
<i>Women were seen</i>
<i>as most closely connected</i>

148
00:08:28,075 --> 00:08:32,310
<i>to the fecundity</i>
<i>of the Earth itself.</i>

149
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:34,779
You're with the... the
feminine principle

150
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:40,785
of the, sort of, Mother Earth,
who gives birth to everything.

151
00:08:42,256 --> 00:08:46,091
This is a very
erotic experience.

152
00:08:46,827 --> 00:08:50,128
Because what this,
what this represents

153
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:54,399
with these deeply
polished grooves

154
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,802
all coming in on a V here,

155
00:08:57,804 --> 00:09:01,339
is probably a vulva.

156
00:09:01,575 --> 00:09:06,912
The vulva, the birth canal
became very symbolic,

157
00:09:06,914 --> 00:09:09,381
as the portal to that,

158
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:12,450
of that... that spiritual quest.

159
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:14,819
<i>Nearly 85% of human figures</i>

160
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:19,457
<i>represented in prehistoric
cave art are female.</i>

161
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:22,294
The richness of... of art
in this area

162
00:09:22,296 --> 00:09:26,565
is sort of kept
beneath the radar.

163
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:30,502
You can imagine why.

164
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:40,946
<i>Caves and cavities</i>
<i>were like a belly,</i>

165
00:09:40,948 --> 00:09:42,681
<i>the womb that gave birth,</i>

166
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:45,850
<i>the womb</i>
<i>that you had to get into,</i>

167
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:50,088
<i>and you also had to</i>
<i>come back out of it.</i>

168
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:59,798
<i>It's obvious from the
architecture of the cave,</i>

169
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,000
<i>and the... the art within it</i>

170
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:05,837
<i>that we're within</i>
<i>the Earth Goddess herself.</i>

171
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:13,111
The vulva here represents
the means of passage

172
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,879
between our world

173
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:17,949
and the inner world
of the spirits.

174
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:23,421
The rock is sort of the membrane
between the here and the beyond.

175
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:28,226
And the horse is
the animal of passage

176
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:31,029
that accompanies the shaman

177
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:34,599
on that transcendental journey

178
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:38,837
deep into the beyond
and then safely back.

179
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:42,540
<i>The reverence of our ancestors</i>
<i>for the miracle of birth</i>

180
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:46,611
<i>inspired the first expressions</i>
<i>of spirituality.</i>

181
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:51,116
This is probably the best
evidence that I know of

182
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:56,721
of a Sacred Feminine principle
through prehistory.

183
00:10:56,723 --> 00:11:00,759
I mean, this is it.
This proves the case.

184
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:05,697
<i>The Sacred Feminine.</i>
<i>The Earth Mother.</i>

185
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:07,432
<i>The pagan goddess.</i>

186
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:12,771
<i>At the core of all religion,</i>
<i>procreation.</i>

187
00:11:17,044 --> 00:11:20,378
<i>The Glastonbury Tor is</i>
<i>a ancient, pagan sacred site</i>

188
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:27,085
which many people come to as a
center for the Divine Feminine.

189
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:28,186
And the hill itself
has the appearance,

190
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:32,157
if you look at it from a
distance, of perhaps a breast,

191
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:34,626
or almost as if
the Earth is pregnant.

192
00:11:34,628 --> 00:11:39,464
And with the tower on the top, it's
the breast idea is accentuated

193
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:42,167
because it's like a nipple.

194
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:46,871
<i>One of the creation myths was that
creation was God masturbating.</i>

195
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:49,174
As the... As the great creation
of the universe,

196
00:11:49,176 --> 00:11:53,611
sex was very much at the center
of ancient spirituality,

197
00:11:53,613 --> 00:11:57,916
as you would expect it to be,
because through sex comes life.

198
00:11:57,918 --> 00:12:00,485
I mean, how incredible is that?

199
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:10,462
<i>Every single mystical
tradition uses as a metaphor</i>

200
00:12:10,464 --> 00:12:14,799
<i>for the union between</i>
<i>the human being and God,</i>

201
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:19,370
every one uses sex as
the human metaphor for that.

202
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:23,074
If you want to understand
what the longing for union is,

203
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,343
think about the longing
in a sexual relationship.

204
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:30,048
You don't even need mystical traditions
and heavy analysis to understand this.

205
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:33,051
Just think about
when you're making love.

206
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:35,854
How many people say,
"Oh, God, oh, God."

207
00:12:35,856 --> 00:12:37,088
Now, you don't say,
"Oh, toaster."

208
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,758
And you don't say, "Oh..."
You know, you say "Oh, God."

209
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,926
Why? Because that word
is a code word

210
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:48,399
for, kind of, the deepest, deepest
connection, communion, union, intimacy.

211
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:51,870
<i>Where do we come from?</i>

212
00:12:51,872 --> 00:12:55,006
<i>Where do we go after we die?</i>

213
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:55,874
<i>These are the mysteries,</i>

214
00:12:55,876 --> 00:12:59,677
<i>the questions that have</i>
<i>fueled our search for meaning</i>

215
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:02,413
<i>from the beginning of time.</i>

216
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:20,365
<i>One of the most important tenets
about what the Christians believe</i>

217
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:25,904
<i>is that death is a transition from
this life to an eternal life.</i>

218
00:13:25,906 --> 00:13:32,377
<i>As a matter of fact, the term "cemetery"
actually means sleeping place.</i>

219
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:36,614
<i>Slave, baby, woman,</i>
<i>wealthy person,</i>

220
00:13:36,616 --> 00:13:38,449
<i>buried next to popes,</i>
<i>noblemen...</i>

221
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:43,488
<i>The catacombs offer a
representation of the universality</i>

222
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:46,424
<i>of the early Christian Church.</i>

223
00:13:50,564 --> 00:13:54,165
<i>It was an absolute innovation</i>
<i>in the Roman world.</i>

224
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:57,769
There were many religions,
promising all kinds of things,

225
00:13:57,771 --> 00:14:03,441
but each one of these religions
had only a select elite few

226
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:04,609
who could join the religion.

227
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:08,213
Christianity offered a God
who loved everybody equally.

228
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:12,383
He didn't look at your color, he
didn't look at your bank statement,

229
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:14,319
he didn't look at your gender.

230
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:17,088
This God loved everyone.

231
00:14:17,624 --> 00:14:20,525
<i>To leave your body behind</i>
<i>for a short while,</i>

232
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:22,360
<i>waiting to be rejoined</i>
<i>with the body</i>

233
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:26,865
<i>the day of the last judgment</i>
<i>in the afterlife.</i>

234
00:14:28,768 --> 00:14:30,535
This God wanted
to save everyone.

235
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:36,674
Which is why the primary images of the
catacombs are always those of salvation.

236
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:41,412
<i>This position of the raised
hands is called the</i> orant,

237
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:44,115
<i>and it means</i>
<i>"the figure in prayer".</i>

238
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:47,518
They always look straight out
at the viewers,

239
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,221
one of the very few images
in catacomb paintings,

240
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:53,691
which have a very direct
relationship towards the viewer.

241
00:14:53,693 --> 00:15:00,098
"Look, I am saved. I am saved through
prayer, you can do it, too."

242
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:07,872
<i>In the years</i>
<i>following the death of Christ,</i>

243
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:11,175
<i>there were many religions</i>
<i>along the Mediterranean basin,</i>

244
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:14,679
<i>each with its own traditions</i>
<i>and mysteries,</i>

245
00:15:14,681 --> 00:15:17,115
<i>all under the thumb</i>
<i>of the Roman empire.</i>

246
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:24,022
<i>Then, in 306, a general ascended to
power, and according to Dan Brown,</i>

247
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:25,957
<i>co-opted the message of Christ,</i>

248
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:30,061
<i>while diminishing</i>
<i>the role of Mary Magdalene.</i>

249
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:34,332
<i>Well, Constantine,</i>
<i>he was declared Emperor</i>

250
00:15:34,334 --> 00:15:35,900
<i>by the troops</i>
<i>in Northern England.</i>

251
00:15:35,902 --> 00:15:39,037
He was up there at York and...
But he had a holy mother,

252
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:40,338
who we remember
as Saint Helena.

253
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:43,441
His mom was... was
a Catholic Christian,

254
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:44,509
so she was there.

255
00:15:44,511 --> 00:15:45,810
And he was also
aware of the fact

256
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:48,846
there were millions of
Christians in his empire,

257
00:15:48,848 --> 00:15:53,851
and, uh, he wanted some religious
glue, and he found it there.

258
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:57,255
<i>Constantine had a dream</i>
<i>or a vision that in this sign,</i>

259
00:15:57,257 --> 00:15:58,923
<i>the sign of the cross,</i>
<i>"You will conquer."</i>

260
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:02,160
So he got his soldiers
to put that on their shields,

261
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:05,363
and Constantine took over.

262
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,465
<i>Changing gods takes time.</i>

263
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:12,837
<i>But it goes faster when the new
story resembles earlier ones.</i>

264
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:17,976
<i>December 25th, the birthday</i>
<i>of the Persian god, Mithras,</i>

265
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:20,211
<i>becomes Christmas.</i>

266
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:22,814
<i>Isis nursing her baby Horus,</i>

267
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:27,151
<i>becomes the Virgin Mary</i>
<i>and the infant Jesus.</i>

268
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:32,991
<i>Poseidon's trident changes</i>
<i>into the devil's pitchfork,</i>

269
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:37,362
<i>and the pentacle, the symbol</i>
<i>of the Sacred Feminine</i>

270
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:40,231
<i>becomes associated with evil,</i>

271
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:45,103
<i>with witchcraft,</i>
<i>with serial killers.</i>

272
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:59,150
<i>This is an ancient sacred site,</i>

273
00:16:59,152 --> 00:17:01,052
<i>which was adopted</i>
<i>by the early Christians.</i>

274
00:17:01,054 --> 00:17:02,587
<i>The whole place is steeped</i>
<i>with mythology</i>

275
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:06,758
<i>and with ambience of... of ancient
spirituality, going right back,</i>

276
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,092
<i>pre-Christian to pagan days.</i>

277
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:14,365
The name "pagan" was used by the
Roman Church, by Christians,

278
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:15,500
to put down the old religion,

279
00:17:15,502 --> 00:17:19,470
and... and it kind of means country
dweller or country bumpkin.

280
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:21,506
The truth, of course, is that

281
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:23,574
the old religion,
the old paganism,

282
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:27,211
in its wider sense,
was immensely sophisticated.

283
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:31,616
This is the philosophy
of ancient civilization.

284
00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:35,386
The civilization which gave us
the pyramids, the Parthenon,

285
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:36,320
mathematics, science...

286
00:17:36,322 --> 00:17:41,659
It's actually... Ironically, it's
after Christianity took over...

287
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:43,528
That... And all of that
was destroyed,

288
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:46,664
that we went back to this
idea that the Earth was flat

289
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:49,133
and that you could be killed
for saying that...

290
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:51,169
Denying that the Earth
goes round the sun,

291
00:17:51,171 --> 00:17:54,605
and we had, well,
the Dark Ages.

292
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:58,743
Religion, it's been about a big
man in the sky with a beard,

293
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:01,179
whose message is
"Do what I tell you."

294
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:03,581
And to women, the message
has been basically,

295
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,650
"Shh. Don't say anything."

296
00:18:05,652 --> 00:18:08,052
You know, "Don't do anything.

297
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:09,320
"You're not really
involved in this."

298
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:10,788
In fact, there was a whole
debate in the Middle Ages,

299
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,657
you know, whether they
even had, women had souls.

300
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:16,761
And now we've all inherited that
and think it's Christianity.

301
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:17,795
That's not what it was about.

302
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:20,731
And we've lost
half of the equation.

303
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:21,866
We've lost the inner mysteries.

304
00:18:21,868 --> 00:18:23,868
We've lost the mysteries
of the Feminine.

305
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:27,805
<i>After the crucifixion,</i>
<i>various Christian sects arose,</i>

306
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:29,507
<i>each telling the story of Jesus</i>

307
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:32,243
<i>from a different point of view.</i>

308
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:34,178
<i>To create a uniform religion,</i>

309
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:37,615
<i>the first Church fathers</i>
<i>chose four gospels,</i>

310
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:38,749
<i>Matthew, Mark, Luke and John,</i>

311
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:42,954
<i>which later became the first
four books of the New Testament.</i>

312
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:46,324
<i>Dozens of other gospels</i>
<i>were declared heretical</i>

313
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:47,992
<i>and were hidden,</i>
<i>lost to history</i>

314
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:51,863
<i>until discovered in the
Egyptian desert in 1945.</i>

315
00:18:51,865 --> 00:18:54,665
<i>The discovery of the Gnostic
Gospels was really a surprise.</i>

316
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:59,437
<i>It was discovered by some villagers
from a small town in Upper Egypt.</i>

317
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:04,609
And much later, we learned that these
had contained an ancient library.

318
00:19:04,611 --> 00:19:07,011
It's really a treasury
of early Christian writings,

319
00:19:07,013 --> 00:19:11,082
including the Gospel of
Thomas, the Gospel of Philip,

320
00:19:11,084 --> 00:19:12,416
the Letter of Peter to Paul,

321
00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:15,253
the Secret Book of James,
the Secret Book of John.

322
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:19,357
Over 50 writings attributed
to Jesus and his disciples.

323
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:22,894
<i>You know, we thought we knew something
about the early Christian movement.</i>

324
00:19:22,896 --> 00:19:24,695
Now we find out
that what we knew

325
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:27,498
is really a small slice
of a much wider range.

326
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,035
So instead of four gospels, as
we have in the New Testament,

327
00:19:31,037 --> 00:19:32,370
you find dozens of others.

328
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:34,438
<i>Now, we always knew</i>
<i>there were dozens of others,</i>

329
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,807
<i>because the fathers</i>
<i>of the Church had said this.</i>

330
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:40,845
<i>They said heretics had written</i>
<i>terrible other secret gospels.</i>

331
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:42,079
And we never
knew what they were.

332
00:19:42,081 --> 00:19:43,481
We just knew
that they were awful.

333
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:48,252
And now for the first time, these ancient
Christians can speak for themselves

334
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:53,291
and we can find out what the people
called heretics actually said.

335
00:19:53,293 --> 00:19:56,527
<i>While the traditional Church</i>
<i>sought to oversee</i>

336
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,596
<i>a person's relationship</i>
<i>with God,</i>

337
00:19:58,598 --> 00:19:59,330
<i>the Gnostics believed</i>

338
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:02,400
<i>that spiritual revelation</i>
<i>could only come from within.</i>

339
00:20:02,402 --> 00:20:06,871
<i>No intercession was required</i>
<i>by priests or rabbis.</i>

340
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:09,373
If you wake up to what you really
are and discover the Christ within,

341
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:12,443
and recognize as that everything
is one, that's gnosis,

342
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:15,413
and you come into love with
everything, that's heaven.

343
00:20:15,415 --> 00:20:20,985
So the original message was by
understanding this powerful myth,

344
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:22,553
you can wake up
to what you really are,

345
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:26,691
and discover that we are all
parts of one body, as Paul says.

346
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:29,694
We're all parts of the Christ,
we're all one.

347
00:20:29,696 --> 00:20:35,866
Back in the second century, Saint Iraneus,
he's definitely supporting four gospels,

348
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:38,135
four gospels, no more, no less.

349
00:20:38,137 --> 00:20:38,970
He knows these Gnostic gospels.

350
00:20:38,972 --> 00:20:42,640
He says they're garbage. I mean, they're
just invented, they're not the real thing,

351
00:20:42,642 --> 00:20:46,978
but Matthew, Mark, Luke and John,
these are the four gospels.

352
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,614
<i>People have to fudge the dates</i>
<i>of these Gnostic Gospels</i>

353
00:20:49,616 --> 00:20:53,718
<i>to use them for their own
purposes claiming they were there</i>

354
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,353
<i>in the middle</i>
<i>of the first century.</i>

355
00:20:55,355 --> 00:20:57,388
Well, that's a maverick claim

356
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:00,691
that the overwhelming majority
of scholars just don't accept.

357
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:03,594
One only needs to read the Gnostic
Gospels from beginning to end

358
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:08,232
to realize, well, thank God
this never made the list.

359
00:21:08,234 --> 00:21:10,468
It used to be easy, you'd say,
"Well, which ones are true?"

360
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:13,938
Well, the Church says, "These.
They're in the New Testament.

361
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,741
"After all, those are the real ones.
These are the fake ones."

362
00:21:16,743 --> 00:21:21,979
It's a lot harder now. If you look at
all of this range of text and say,

363
00:21:21,981 --> 00:21:22,913
"What can you believe?"

364
00:21:22,915 --> 00:21:24,448
There are not just the four
gospels in the New Testament,

365
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:30,321
there were hundreds, probably, of Gnostic
Gospels, many of which we now found.

366
00:21:30,323 --> 00:21:31,956
<i>And they're very mythological.</i>

367
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,592
You can see that
there's a natural continuum

368
00:21:34,594 --> 00:21:38,162
of a synthesis of pagan
and Jewish tradition,

369
00:21:38,164 --> 00:21:41,299
and Jesus is a kind of
ancient superhero.

370
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:42,566
<i>He's like Batman</i>
<i>meets Superman.</i>

371
00:21:42,568 --> 00:21:47,138
<i>He combines the Messiah</i>
<i>with the pagan God-Man,</i>

372
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,407
<i>and has the attributes of both.</i>

373
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:51,042
The most important myth
in the ancient world

374
00:21:51,044 --> 00:21:54,512
is the story of a dying
and resurrecting God-Man.

375
00:21:54,514 --> 00:21:56,847
<i>He changes water into wine</i>
<i>at a wedding,</i>

376
00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:59,450
<i>performs these miracles, bringing
back people from the dead,</i>

377
00:21:59,452 --> 00:22:01,385
<i>all of the things</i>
<i>we associate with Jesus,</i>

378
00:22:01,387 --> 00:22:02,987
right up to the really
crucial things, of course,

379
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:07,425
which is dying at Easter,
sometimes through crucifixion.

380
00:22:07,427 --> 00:22:11,662
<i>He then resurrects</i>
<i>and to share in eternal life,</i>

381
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:15,599
you take bread and wine
to commune with God.

382
00:22:15,601 --> 00:22:18,669
Now that's Christianity,
and this existed

383
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:23,174
before anyone had the idea
of there being Jesus.

384
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:26,477
<i>The Jesus story, if you stand back
from it, it looks like a myth,</i>

385
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:28,746
<i>it's the story of someone who's born
of a virgin, for goodness' sake,</i>

386
00:22:28,748 --> 00:22:32,950
and comes back from the dead, I've never
met anyone who was born of a virgin

387
00:22:32,952 --> 00:22:33,684
or came back from the dead.

388
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:36,587
It looks like a myth
because it is a myth.

389
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:39,990
<i>The gospels you find in the New
Testament like Matthew, Mark,</i>

390
00:22:39,992 --> 00:22:44,061
tell you what Jesus preached out on
the hills to thousands of people.

391
00:22:44,063 --> 00:22:47,965
But Mark says that Jesus taught his
disciples privately, secretly,

392
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:50,034
<i>secret things. And he doesn't
tell you what they said.</i>

393
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:55,172
Now these other gospels often claim to be
secret teachings and they were probably meant

394
00:22:55,174 --> 00:23:01,579
to be just for the few who were
going on to a deeper level.

395
00:23:01,581 --> 00:23:04,648
Now what's happened is that
myth has been literalized.

396
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,384
It's become about a literal man

397
00:23:06,386 --> 00:23:09,854
who you literally believe
came and literally died

398
00:23:09,856 --> 00:23:13,224
for your sins,
as an historical event.

399
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:15,760
And what that's done is it's
cut us off from that power,

400
00:23:15,762 --> 00:23:20,698
the power to actually transform
us and help us experience gnosis.

401
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,466
<i>The Gnostics were mystics.</i>

402
00:23:22,468 --> 00:23:25,970
<i>Instead of worshiping Christ</i>
<i>as a literal figure,</i>

403
00:23:25,972 --> 00:23:27,171
<i>a man of flesh and blood,</i>

404
00:23:27,173 --> 00:23:30,508
<i>they considered his life</i>
<i>and teachings as allegories,</i>

405
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:34,412
<i>stories that helped guide</i>
<i>their journey toward truth.</i>

406
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:35,746
So instead of speaking of Jesus

407
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:37,715
as an utterly unique being
on whom you must believe,

408
00:23:37,717 --> 00:23:44,121
<i>they picture Jesus as someone who
manifests what anyone could become.</i>

409
00:23:44,123 --> 00:23:46,957
<i>And that is a very different</i>
<i>kind of message.</i>

410
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:52,129
The Gospel of Mary says the Son of
Man is within you, follow after him.

411
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:53,664
You don't have to find
Jesus of Nazareth,

412
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:56,500
but you have to find
what's within you.

413
00:24:09,482 --> 00:24:11,382
Throughout
the Gnostic scriptures,

414
00:24:11,384 --> 00:24:13,050
there is a little
bone of contention

415
00:24:13,052 --> 00:24:16,120
between the fact that the
disciples have been with Christ,

416
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:19,523
but Mary has been with him
slightly longer.

417
00:24:19,525 --> 00:24:20,724
She's... She's been
with him more.

418
00:24:20,726 --> 00:24:25,563
She knows more of his
secrets than... than they do.

419
00:24:25,698 --> 00:24:31,268
<i>She almost acts as someone
of, not co-wisdom with him,</i>

420
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:34,205
but as someone
whose questions of him

421
00:24:34,207 --> 00:24:36,474
show an intelligence
and an understanding

422
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:41,812
that the questions from the other
of the disciples just do not show.

423
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:45,249
And so that closeness,
um, has been seen,

424
00:24:45,251 --> 00:24:48,419
by many people who've read
the Gnostic scriptures,

425
00:24:48,421 --> 00:24:54,258
as evidence of a personal and
literal sexual relationship.

426
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:57,127
Certainly Dan Brown
who wrote <i> The Da Vinci Code</i>

427
00:24:57,129 --> 00:24:59,964
took off from a few lines
that were found

428
00:24:59,966 --> 00:25:02,833
in some of these secret texts
because they are very provocative.

429
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:06,937
The ones with which he started are
from the Gospel of Philip which says,

430
00:25:06,939 --> 00:25:12,109
"Jesus loved Mary more than all the disciples
and he kissed her often on her..."

431
00:25:12,111 --> 00:25:15,045
And then the text breaks,
and you don't know.

432
00:25:15,047 --> 00:25:18,282
What actually happens in these texts
is something rather different.

433
00:25:18,284 --> 00:25:24,255
There, she is described as the companion
of Jesus, and the language is erotic.

434
00:25:24,257 --> 00:25:26,190
But it's the language
of a mystical writer

435
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:30,528
who talks about Mary as the
manifestation of the Holy Spirit.

436
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:32,830
<i>If you look</i>
<i>at the mystical traditions</i>

437
00:25:32,832 --> 00:25:36,667
<i>of Judaism, of Islam</i>
<i>and of Christianity,</i>

438
00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:42,206
<i>you find the Divine is often</i>
<i>spoken of as the Father.</i>

439
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:44,575
<i>But there is also</i>
<i>a mother or a daughter,</i>

440
00:25:44,577 --> 00:25:49,647
someone who sits alongside
and helps the Divine.

441
00:25:49,649 --> 00:25:53,551
And in the Jewish tradition, um,
that figure is the Shekinah,

442
00:25:53,553 --> 00:25:56,086
who is the presence of God.
She's seen as female.

443
00:25:56,088 --> 00:26:00,257
In the Islamic tradition, um,
she's called the Sakina

444
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:01,959
and she behaves
in a very similar way.

445
00:26:01,961 --> 00:26:04,695
She is accompanying
the soul through life.

446
00:26:04,697 --> 00:26:07,998
<i>In Gnosticism,</i>
<i>she lives an ordinary life,</i>

447
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,337
<i>and suffers and shares what we would
understand as the human condition.</i>

448
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:20,978
She makes mighty things to come about.
She is a very powerful lady indeed.

449
00:26:21,314 --> 00:26:22,379
Dan Brown has given us
the impression

450
00:26:22,381 --> 00:26:27,084
that Mary Magdalene gets this exalted
point of being, the... the equal of Jesus.

451
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:29,420
The problem is
that this cannot be.

452
00:26:29,422 --> 00:26:31,088
Because Jesus is God.
So what is she, God?

453
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:35,192
In which case, we don't have the same,
we're not talking about the same religion.

454
00:26:35,194 --> 00:26:36,026
I mean, you can't say this is

455
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:38,062
something that the Catholic
Church is hiding from you,

456
00:26:38,064 --> 00:26:40,464
because this is clearly not the
same religion we're talking about.

457
00:26:40,466 --> 00:26:42,900
There is one God,
and there are no other gods.

458
00:26:42,902 --> 00:26:45,869
I mean, I was under the impression
this was kind of laid out

459
00:26:45,871 --> 00:26:47,638
in the Ten Commandments
a while ago.

460
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,641
A lot of people today have
been concerned with issues,

461
00:26:50,643 --> 00:26:52,977
both about women
and feminine language.

462
00:26:52,979 --> 00:26:55,913
But many people think
it's a very new issue.

463
00:26:55,915 --> 00:26:57,715
What's interesting
is that it appeared

464
00:26:57,717 --> 00:26:58,983
at the very beginning
of the Christian movement.

465
00:26:58,985 --> 00:27:03,120
Sometimes people say to me, "Well, you
know, that all sounds very new age."

466
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:07,458
And I think, well, you know,
2,000 years is not so new.

467
00:27:10,496 --> 00:27:12,463
<i>It is here at Chateau Villette</i>

468
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:15,833
<i>that Sophie Neveu is told of</i>
<i>the church's role in denying</i>

469
00:27:15,835 --> 00:27:22,373
<i>the importance of the Sacred
Feminine and of Mary Magdalene.</i>

470
00:27:29,015 --> 00:27:30,748
The center story about
<i>The Da Vinci Code,</i>

471
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:33,717
it's all experienced right
here, at the Chateau.

472
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:39,123
The bulk of the story in history, actually,
was told right here, in this room,

473
00:27:39,125 --> 00:27:41,091
and right on this sofa,
actually.

474
00:27:41,093 --> 00:27:42,326
And in fact, right in this sofa

475
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:46,964
is where they hide the keystone,
underneath this sofa.

476
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:49,266
<i>The keystone</i>
<i>in</i> The Da Vinci Code

477
00:27:49,268 --> 00:27:53,871
<i>is the relationship between Mary
Magdalene and Jesus Christ.</i>

478
00:27:53,873 --> 00:27:56,073
<i>Their story resonates</i>
<i>with many people,</i>

479
00:27:56,075 --> 00:28:00,711
<i>but for some, the message</i>
<i>does not go far enough.</i>

480
00:28:00,713 --> 00:28:04,014
Of all the things
in <i> The Da Vinci Code</i>

481
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:04,748
that makes me the angriest,

482
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:11,355
is that a man who is writing a book that's
supposed to be about the Divine Feminine

483
00:28:11,357 --> 00:28:12,656
denigrates Mary Magdalene

484
00:28:12,658 --> 00:28:18,295
and says she is nothing more than
the perpetrator of a bloodline,

485
00:28:18,297 --> 00:28:22,466
instead of talking about her
as a passionate preacher,

486
00:28:22,468 --> 00:28:24,368
as an independent woman
in her own right.

487
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:28,038
If anything, <i> The Da Vinci Code
</i> suddenly raises all these questions

488
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,774
that, you know, that have
never been discussed publicly.

489
00:28:30,776 --> 00:28:32,142
No. It is absolutely clear.

490
00:28:32,144 --> 00:28:35,546
The bad guys are the Catholic
Church and Opus Dei.

491
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:37,881
The good guys are
the Priory of Sion.

492
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:40,284
It is Indiana Jones
all the way.

493
00:28:40,286 --> 00:28:42,886
But it's against what we've
been brought up to believe.

494
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:45,122
Yeah. I... I... See, I,
again, I think that

495
00:28:45,124 --> 00:28:48,025
when the book says this is what
you were taught to believe,

496
00:28:48,027 --> 00:28:50,461
you don't remember, really, what
you were taught to believe,

497
00:28:50,463 --> 00:28:52,396
but when they tell you that, you
say, "Oh, yeah, that's right.

498
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:55,966
"Yeah, I was taught to believe that.
Because, hey, I slept through my classes."

499
00:28:55,968 --> 00:29:00,537
But he has a talent. He made it a suspense.
It's a <i> polar.</i>

500
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:02,539
It's the first book you read
in two nights.

501
00:29:02,541 --> 00:29:07,945
...because I read all these other books,
and Dan Brown made a novel out of it,

502
00:29:07,947 --> 00:29:12,316
and much easier to read,
and more interesting to read.

503
00:29:12,318 --> 00:29:17,988
And I kept falling to sleep when I
read <i> The Holy Grail, Holy Blood.</i>

504
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:18,822
It was very difficult to read.

505
00:29:18,824 --> 00:29:22,793
- What do you think about...
- To use the name of Da Vinci?

506
00:29:22,795 --> 00:29:25,362
Da Vinci was one weird guy.

507
00:29:25,364 --> 00:29:27,664
And I'm sure he put codes
and things in there.

508
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:30,567
I just don't think they had
anything to do with what.

509
00:29:30,569 --> 00:29:34,138
<i>The Holy Blood, Holy Grail</i>
or <i> The Da Vinci Code</i> said.

510
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,240
Leonardo was
an interesting person,

511
00:29:36,242 --> 00:29:39,977
and I don't think
anybody understands him.

512
00:29:39,979 --> 00:29:41,912
Maybe his mother.

513
00:29:42,148 --> 00:29:46,083
<i>Architect, engineer, inventor.</i>

514
00:29:46,085 --> 00:29:47,951
<i>Leonardo was so complex,</i>

515
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:51,054
<i>he was almost impossible</i>
<i>to comprehend.</i>

516
00:29:51,056 --> 00:29:53,657
<i>Which is why we have</i>
<i>never stopped trying.</i>

517
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:57,961
The <i> Last Supper</i> is obviously one of the
most famous paintings in the world.

518
00:29:57,963 --> 00:30:00,430
In fact, it's probably
one of two famous paintings,

519
00:30:00,432 --> 00:30:03,400
the other being the <i> Mona Lisa,</i>
both by Leonardo Da Vinci,

520
00:30:03,402 --> 00:30:05,302
um, and they're both
very weird.

521
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:09,173
<i>The core of</i> The Da Vinci
Code <i> is the symbolism</i>

522
00:30:09,175 --> 00:30:11,942
<i>in Leonardo Da Vinci's</i>
Last Supper.

523
00:30:11,944 --> 00:30:16,547
We were the first people to
notice what everybody now knows.

524
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:17,748
Um, and they say,
"Thanks to Dan Brown."

525
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,550
It's not "Thanks to Dan
Brown," it's thanks to us.

526
00:30:19,552 --> 00:30:25,889
Um, that's in fact the world knows
that, or at least suspects, that, uh,

527
00:30:25,891 --> 00:30:27,891
the person sitting
on Jesus' right hand

528
00:30:27,893 --> 00:30:31,228
in the <i> Last Supper</i> is not
the young St. John at all.

529
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:34,932
And you looked at it, and you think,
"Wait a minute, that's a woman."

530
00:30:34,934 --> 00:30:37,434
Basically all you have to do
is look at it with new eyes.

531
00:30:37,436 --> 00:30:41,572
Well, Jesus is sitting there, sort
of, going like this, isn't He?

532
00:30:41,574 --> 00:30:43,974
And she, it was,
what, because it isn't...

533
00:30:43,976 --> 00:30:45,309
Oh, hang on.
I have to be Jesus.

534
00:30:45,311 --> 00:30:46,677
Yes, that's what I'm saying,
you're Jesus,

535
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:48,011
but I was just doing...
Yes, you're doing that.

536
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:52,749
And... And he or she is, you know,
is sort of leaning away like this

537
00:30:52,751 --> 00:30:54,718
but almost as if joined,
still joined at the hip.

538
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,222
<i>Together they make a giant,
spread-eagled M shape.</i>

539
00:30:58,224 --> 00:31:00,057
Uh, well, the M
gives you a clue.

540
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:01,692
<i>It's some, someone</i>
<i>whose name begins with M.</i>

541
00:31:01,694 --> 00:31:05,362
<i>Not the Virgin Mary.</i>
<i>It must be Mary Magdalene.</i>

542
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:06,096
Oh, I see 12 male apostles.

543
00:31:06,098 --> 00:31:10,701
I mean, if that figure is Mary
Magdalene next to Jesus, where's John?

544
00:31:10,703 --> 00:31:14,071
Assuming that that figure
is Mary Magdalene,

545
00:31:14,073 --> 00:31:16,440
<i>a hand cuts across</i>
<i>her neck visually.</i>

546
00:31:16,442 --> 00:31:20,077
Um, it looks like a disciple
is leaning on her shoulder,

547
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:24,381
like this, leaning forward, but in fact,
visually the hand is threatening,

548
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:29,920
um, and that disciple is, who's
doing that, is Saint Peter.

549
00:31:29,922 --> 00:31:31,288
The other interesting thing
in that painting

550
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:36,193
is that Peter is portrayed with
his hand across Mary's throat,

551
00:31:36,195 --> 00:31:39,162
<i>and with a knife.</i>
<i>Now what's that?</i>

552
00:31:39,164 --> 00:31:43,400
Peter, Judas and, uh, Saint
John in one group together.

553
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:47,070
<i>Peter is so angry at this news</i>
<i>that Jesus will be betrayed,</i>

554
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:49,740
<i>and he's... and he's</i>
<i>right next to the traitor,</i>

555
00:31:49,742 --> 00:31:53,210
whereas John is much more
contemplative and tranquil.

556
00:31:53,212 --> 00:31:55,312
And that's the normal way
it's being understood.

557
00:31:55,314 --> 00:31:59,583
Once you see that Peter in Gnostic
mythology also represents ignorance,

558
00:31:59,585 --> 00:32:03,887
he is the, he represents each
one of us at our most lost,

559
00:32:03,889 --> 00:32:05,756
<i>and he is shown</i>
<i>in Gnostic gospels</i>

560
00:32:05,758 --> 00:32:08,759
<i>as antagonistic to Mary,</i>
<i>he's jealous of Mary.</i>

561
00:32:08,761 --> 00:32:12,329
Saint Peter was hugely jealous
of her and kept going to Jesus

562
00:32:12,331 --> 00:32:16,800
and saying, "Lord, let Mary leave us
'cause women are not worthy of life."

563
00:32:16,802 --> 00:32:20,370
He doesn't like the fact that
Mary has the ear of Jesus,

564
00:32:20,372 --> 00:32:22,572
all of this,
allegorical of course.

565
00:32:22,574 --> 00:32:26,109
Then you understand why
Peter is there with a knife,

566
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:27,878
<i>and trying to silence Mary.</i>

567
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,846
You know, Saint Peter founded
the Catholic Church

568
00:32:29,848 --> 00:32:32,482
on the authority
given him by Jesus.

569
00:32:32,484 --> 00:32:33,183
Supposing he never got it.

570
00:32:33,185 --> 00:32:36,586
Supposing the authority
was given to a woman.

571
00:32:36,588 --> 00:32:40,390
Mary Magdalene is not present
in Leonardo's <i> Last Supper.</i>

572
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:44,795
It is a painting that has been
sitting on a wall for 500 years.

573
00:32:44,797 --> 00:32:49,066
It's been looked at by some of
the greatest art historians,

574
00:32:49,068 --> 00:32:51,268
some of the most
keen observers,

575
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:52,569
it has never been forwarded

576
00:32:52,571 --> 00:32:56,840
that the figure is Mary Magdalene.
It is not.

577
00:32:57,876 --> 00:33:00,844
<i>Sometimes</i>
<i>the stories our ancestors told</i>

578
00:33:00,846 --> 00:33:02,279
<i>are forgotten or suppressed,</i>

579
00:33:02,281 --> 00:33:05,182
<i>but they remain</i>
<i>in our collective unconscious</i>

580
00:33:05,184 --> 00:33:06,717
<i>waiting to emerge.</i>

581
00:33:06,719 --> 00:33:09,219
<i>And like Robert Langdon</i>
<i>and Sophie Neveu,</i>

582
00:33:09,221 --> 00:33:11,588
<i>we pick up the threads</i>
<i>of these stories,</i>

583
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:14,858
<i>hoping to find where they lead.</i>

584
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:20,998
Mary Magdalene is a signpost.

585
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,069
<i>She's not the destination.</i>
<i>She is a messenger,</i>

586
00:33:26,071 --> 00:33:29,039
and in that case,
she is a model to us all,

587
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:32,709
because she, she keeps on,
um, being a disciple.

588
00:33:32,711 --> 00:33:38,749
She keeps on being faithful, even when people
shout at her, and say, "No, you're wrong.

589
00:33:38,751 --> 00:33:39,816
"We're... We know better."

590
00:33:39,818 --> 00:33:46,556
<i>She is faithful and I think that's a
faith that we could all learn from.</i>

591
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:08,011
These are what I call 'Magdalene
pilgrims' and they come here to Vezelay

592
00:34:08,013 --> 00:34:15,452
looking for Mary Magdalene, for what
they call the true Mary Magdalene.

593
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:20,991
They define themselves
as pilgrims and so they

594
00:34:20,993 --> 00:34:25,095
are also following in the
footsteps of medieval pilgrims

595
00:34:25,097 --> 00:34:30,934
who were coming to Vezelay to venerate
the relics of Mary Magdalene.

596
00:34:34,506 --> 00:34:40,877
These Magdalene pilgrims want to contact
in some way with her and with her energy

597
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:46,516
because they think most of all
that she is relevant for women.

598
00:34:48,153 --> 00:34:54,891
They believe that Mary Magdalene was
not only a simple disciple of Jesus

599
00:34:54,893 --> 00:34:57,661
but she actually
was his teacher.

600
00:34:57,663 --> 00:35:04,868
According to these pilgrims, it is partly
thanks to Mary Magdalene's teachings

601
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:07,971
that Jesus could do
what he did.

602
00:35:07,973 --> 00:35:14,010
Well, the Catholic Church treated Mary
Magdalene in a quite ambiguous way

603
00:35:14,012 --> 00:35:19,683
because in the four gospels they do not
say that Mary Magdalene is a prostitute.

604
00:35:19,685 --> 00:35:23,286
This came out only later,
in the sixth century

605
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:29,226
because a Pope declared that,
according to his point of view.

606
00:35:29,228 --> 00:35:31,628
Mary Magdalene and two other

607
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:35,732
female figures in the gospels
were the same woman.

608
00:35:35,734 --> 00:35:41,438
So, until 1969,
the Catholic Church

609
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,708
considered Magdalene
as a prostitute

610
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:48,211
and as a repentant sinner
who converts

611
00:35:48,213 --> 00:35:50,080
at the moment she meets Jesus

612
00:35:50,082 --> 00:35:56,553
and at the moment Jesus
heals her from seven demons.

613
00:36:11,303 --> 00:36:14,838
<i>Hail Mary, full of grace,</i>
<i>the Lord is with thee.</i>

614
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:19,910
<i>Blessed art thou among women and blessed
is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.</i>

615
00:36:19,912 --> 00:36:25,048
<i>Holy Mary, Mother of God,</i>
<i>Saint Mary Magdalene,</i>

616
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:27,784
<i>Saint Joseph,</i>
<i>all you saints of God,</i>

617
00:36:27,786 --> 00:36:33,590
<i>pray for us, sinners, now and
at the hour of our death. Amen.</i>

618
00:36:42,401 --> 00:36:44,801
Mind your head.

619
00:36:45,204 --> 00:36:47,070
Mind your head.

620
00:36:59,284 --> 00:37:03,086
<i>Relics said to be</i>
<i>those of Saint Mary Magdalene</i>

621
00:37:03,088 --> 00:37:05,956
<i>were acquired</i>
<i>in the 11th century,</i>

622
00:37:05,958 --> 00:37:07,791
<i>and they were,</i>
<i>in fact, ratified</i>

623
00:37:07,793 --> 00:37:12,929
<i>officially by the pope of the
day, about the year 1050.</i>

624
00:37:12,931 --> 00:37:15,098
<i>It meant that</i>
<i>when the pilgrims came,</i>

625
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:18,101
<i>they brought money for</i>
<i>the building of the church,</i>

626
00:37:18,103 --> 00:37:23,139
<i>and this whole basilica was
built with pilgrim offerings.</i>

627
00:37:24,042 --> 00:37:26,176
<i>The kingdom of God is close.</i>

628
00:37:26,178 --> 00:37:32,649
And the evidence that his message
is true is the resurrection.

629
00:37:32,651 --> 00:37:36,186
And that's why Saint Mary
Magdalene is so important.

630
00:37:36,188 --> 00:37:40,890
<i>She's the first person</i>
<i>to hear, touch, see,</i>

631
00:37:40,892 --> 00:37:43,026
<i>smell our Lord risen.</i>

632
00:37:43,028 --> 00:37:45,228
<i>He says to her,</i>
<i>"Don't touch me."</i>

633
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:48,131
<i>Meaning, "Don't cling to me, don't
try and hold me in this world,</i>

634
00:37:48,133 --> 00:37:53,737
"I am ascending to the Father. I've come, in
other words, to take everything into heaven."

635
00:37:53,739 --> 00:37:57,574
She's the first person to communicate
this knowledge to the world.

636
00:37:57,576 --> 00:38:03,647
She goes to the apostles that first resurrection
morning and they don't believe her.

637
00:38:03,649 --> 00:38:06,383
"She's a woman, you know."

638
00:38:07,552 --> 00:38:09,452
"Silly woman."

639
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:12,889
<i>Why did he choose</i>
<i>Mary Magdalene?</i>

640
00:38:13,158 --> 00:38:18,194
I think for the real answer to
that, you'd need to ask our Lord.

641
00:38:18,196 --> 00:38:21,464
It's just part of
God's humility.

642
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:23,300
The only way God can express it

643
00:38:23,302 --> 00:38:26,936
is by choosing a broken woman
like Saint Mary Magdalene

644
00:38:26,938 --> 00:38:32,008
to be the first
to announce the resurrection.

645
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:38,181
<i>And the living experience</i>
<i>that Christians have</i>

646
00:38:38,183 --> 00:38:45,322
in their relationship with Saint Mary Magdalene.
She's alive, not dead.

647
00:38:46,124 --> 00:38:51,328
She's died, sure, in terms of
this life and this world,

648
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:54,998
but in Christian terms,
she's alive.

649
00:38:55,133 --> 00:38:58,968
Spiritually, she's here
and she's at work.

650
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:01,571
<i>She's at work wherever</i>
<i>the Holy Spirit's at work.</i>

651
00:39:01,573 --> 00:39:05,709
<i>That doesn't mean to say she's some
kind of goddess. She isn't at all.</i>

652
00:39:05,711 --> 00:39:10,580
<i>She's just a Christian saint,</i>
<i>but a very important one.</i>

653
00:39:11,383 --> 00:39:17,020
There is no history whatsoever
that she was married,

654
00:39:17,022 --> 00:39:19,689
and there's no history
that she ever had children.

655
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:26,529
And she certainly didn't have any kind of
relationship of that kind with our Lord.

656
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:30,467
That, that's sheer
20th century fantasy.

657
00:39:30,469 --> 00:39:36,806
Not because the Church, as an institution,
suppressed it, it just isn't there.

658
00:39:36,808 --> 00:39:43,012
It's just not consonant with our
Lord's life, nor with hers.

659
00:39:46,585 --> 00:39:51,654
<i>It has been said that Jesus, being
a rabbi, would have been married.</i>

660
00:39:51,656 --> 00:39:57,293
<i>But what if Jesus had lived among the
Essenes, a community of celibate Jews</i>

661
00:39:57,295 --> 00:39:59,896
<i>along the western shore</i>
<i>of the Dead Sea?</i>

662
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:01,631
One of the things
we know about the Essenes,

663
00:40:01,633 --> 00:40:04,234
these people were so crazy
about ritual purity.

664
00:40:04,236 --> 00:40:05,769
For example, not only did you
have to take a bath

665
00:40:05,771 --> 00:40:07,470
after you came back
from going to the bathroom,

666
00:40:07,472 --> 00:40:12,776
but you had to go into the <i> mikvah</i> which
is a spiritual bath, twice a day.

667
00:40:13,044 --> 00:40:16,212
These were a group of celibate
men who were living out here

668
00:40:16,214 --> 00:40:17,380
according to
the ancient writers.

669
00:40:17,382 --> 00:40:19,949
These people were fanatical
about ritual purity.

670
00:40:19,951 --> 00:40:24,387
<i>Who did Jesus hang out with? He
hung out with the prostitutes,</i>

671
00:40:24,389 --> 00:40:25,889
<i>with the blind,</i>
<i>the lame, the halt.</i>

672
00:40:25,891 --> 00:40:28,291
<i>These are the type of people,</i>
<i>from a Jewish point of view,</i>

673
00:40:28,293 --> 00:40:32,595
<i>you do not want to have anything
to do with if you're an Essene.</i>

674
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:34,397
<i>And since Jesus hung out</i>
<i>with these people,</i>

675
00:40:34,399 --> 00:40:37,000
<i>Jesus would not even have
been allowed near this place.</i>

676
00:40:37,002 --> 00:40:42,405
Well, it's clear that the Christians
were influenced by these people,

677
00:40:42,407 --> 00:40:45,608
but was Jesus here? No way.

678
00:40:51,883 --> 00:40:54,284
<i>Not far from</i>
<i>the sea of Galilee,</i>

679
00:40:54,286 --> 00:40:55,852
<i>where Jesus revealed</i>
<i>his miracles,</i>

680
00:40:55,854 --> 00:41:02,559
<i>is the town of Migdal, said to be
the birthplace of Mary Magdalene.</i>

681
00:41:06,431 --> 00:41:10,800
The Kabbala doesn't see as a
forbidden subject that a woman

682
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:15,405
would sit and learn with men.

683
00:41:15,407 --> 00:41:17,907
Jesus was a Tanach.

684
00:41:18,343 --> 00:41:19,042
Tanach means a...

685
00:41:19,044 --> 00:41:23,947
in order to be a Tanach, you
have to work really hard at your

686
00:41:23,949 --> 00:41:25,782
inner cleanness.

687
00:41:25,784 --> 00:41:29,986
You have to be
a really purified person.

688
00:41:30,689 --> 00:41:31,488
Jesus was... one of them.

689
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:38,628
And he learned not only the revealed
part of the Judaism, of the Torah...

690
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:43,233
but the inner part. The
secret part of the Judaism

691
00:41:43,235 --> 00:41:44,000
which is the Kabbala.

692
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:51,307
I don't think Jesus could have reached
this high level without a wife.

693
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:53,176
He had to have a wife.

694
00:41:53,178 --> 00:41:55,812
The Torah says that
if you are not married

695
00:41:55,814 --> 00:41:57,447
you can't go into the Torah.

696
00:41:57,449 --> 00:42:01,217
The role of the man
is to bring the light.

697
00:42:01,219 --> 00:42:05,655
The role of the wife
is to reveal the light

698
00:42:05,657 --> 00:42:07,657
in the physical world.

699
00:42:07,659 --> 00:42:11,728
If you tried to look at it
through Kabbala eyes...

700
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:16,299
...he should have had a wife
and I think he had a wife.

701
00:42:16,301 --> 00:42:19,802
<i>There is a legend</i>
<i>that tells of Mary Magdalene</i>

702
00:42:19,804 --> 00:42:22,272
<i>fleeing persecution</i>
<i>in Palestine</i>

703
00:42:22,274 --> 00:42:24,941
<i>and arriving</i>
<i>at the south of France</i>

704
00:42:24,943 --> 00:42:28,478
<i>in a boat without oars or sail.</i>

705
00:42:29,915 --> 00:42:35,952
This beautiful door represents the two
Saint Marys with their servant, Sarah.

706
00:42:35,954 --> 00:42:40,657
It is said here that on a boat,
when the two Marys arrived...

707
00:42:40,659 --> 00:42:46,763
...there was also a girl,
who was from Egypt.

708
00:42:57,242 --> 00:43:00,076
The story is that Mary Magdalene
had a child with Jesus Christ.

709
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:01,978
That would be Sarah.

710
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:05,515
I don't believe it at all.

711
00:43:06,785 --> 00:43:09,085
I believe Jesus was
totally dedicated to God.

712
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:16,025
I can't imagine that he would
take the time to have human love.

713
00:43:16,027 --> 00:43:20,029
It would be a contradiction
with His mission.

714
00:43:20,031 --> 00:43:25,168
Celibacy of the priesthood, that
mirrors the celibacy of Christ.

715
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:27,270
It's only a question of time...

716
00:43:27,272 --> 00:43:31,441
...the time it takes to dedicate
yourself to God and to others.

717
00:43:31,443 --> 00:43:38,915
If you're married, you must spend a lot
of time with your wife and children.

718
00:43:38,917 --> 00:43:40,383
<i>With or without child,</i>

719
00:43:40,385 --> 00:43:47,657
<i>the story of Mary was told throughout
this region, and people listened.</i>

720
00:43:49,027 --> 00:43:51,761
The fact is, the first Christians
arrived and brought the faith.

721
00:43:51,763 --> 00:43:55,965
I believe in the beginning
there was a rapid conversion.

722
00:43:55,967 --> 00:44:01,871
The poor class were the first to be
touched by the message of the Christians.

723
00:44:02,007 --> 00:44:05,274
Jesus was a message
of liberation and love.

724
00:44:05,276 --> 00:44:08,544
And the disenfranchised
were moved.

725
00:44:20,859 --> 00:44:28,197
After Mary Magdalene arrived here
with the other Saint Marys...

726
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,501
...she just continued
on her way.

727
00:44:31,503 --> 00:44:34,837
Her story picks up again
in Sainte Baume.

728
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:39,242
It's not too far from here,
up in the mountains.

729
00:44:58,296 --> 00:45:02,098
In the Middle Ages, Christians
were told and believed

730
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:05,535
that Mary Magdalene
had ended her days in Provence

731
00:45:05,537 --> 00:45:11,174
at the top of this mountain called La
Sainte Baume, which means 'the grotto'.

732
00:45:11,176 --> 00:45:15,044
<i>And she contemplated</i>
<i>and repented for her sins.</i>

733
00:45:15,046 --> 00:45:20,149
In order to do so, she divested
herself of her clothes,

734
00:45:20,151 --> 00:45:23,586
because this meant that she
was close to God in holiness.

735
00:45:23,588 --> 00:45:29,325
She wasn't concerned with her
worldly goods and her worldly life.

736
00:45:29,327 --> 00:45:32,895
She didn't eat,
she fasted, she wept.

737
00:45:32,897 --> 00:45:37,366
And in order to keep her covered,
in order to make her decent,

738
00:45:37,368 --> 00:45:40,536
her hair grew down,
around her body.

739
00:45:40,538 --> 00:45:46,709
<i>Everyday she was taken up to heaven by
angels who gave her heavenly sustenance,</i>

740
00:45:46,711 --> 00:45:51,948
<i>spiritual sustenance.</i>
<i>She had no need of human food.</i>

741
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:53,783
But this is where she came,

742
00:45:53,785 --> 00:46:00,323
and this is where pilgrims from the
middle of the 13th century came

743
00:46:00,325 --> 00:46:03,326
to pray and to think about her.

744
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:09,365
<i>Sweet Lover of God.</i>

745
00:46:09,367 --> 00:46:14,036
<i>I mean, that exemplifies the whole
medieval concept of Mary Magdalene,</i>

746
00:46:14,038 --> 00:46:18,674
<i>that she was the sweet</i>
<i>friend or lover of God.</i>

747
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:21,978
They've been coming here
since 1250,

748
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:24,514
and are still coming
on their pilgrimage

749
00:46:24,516 --> 00:46:28,017
to see where Mary Magdalene
spent her last days.

750
00:46:28,019 --> 00:46:32,722
This is the final end of the
pilgrimage to the grotto

751
00:46:32,724 --> 00:46:37,660
where Mary Magdalene spent
the last 30 years of her life.

752
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:43,032
We're entering
in this huge cavern,

753
00:46:43,034 --> 00:46:45,168
which amazed believers,
pilgrims.

754
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:47,970
And they wrote back,
wrote memoirs

755
00:46:47,972 --> 00:46:50,840
on how miraculous it was.
They would come here,

756
00:46:50,842 --> 00:46:55,044
pray and think about
Mary Magdalene, the apostle,

757
00:46:55,046 --> 00:47:00,883
and the person who converted
France to Christianity.

758
00:47:14,265 --> 00:47:14,897
This is the crypt

759
00:47:14,899 --> 00:47:20,903
where Mary Magdalene's bones were
believed, in the Middle Ages, to lie.

760
00:47:20,905 --> 00:47:25,174
When the monks claimed to have
her relics, or her bones here,

761
00:47:25,176 --> 00:47:29,245
they said they had her entire
body minus an arm.

762
00:47:30,215 --> 00:47:35,985
The skull, you can see, is of
a woman around the age of 50.

763
00:47:36,387 --> 00:47:37,220
Claiming to having her relics,

764
00:47:37,222 --> 00:47:42,892
would bring the Church money from the...
the pilgrims that came in their thousands.

765
00:47:42,894 --> 00:47:47,897
The more powerful the saint, the
more money you would have coming in.

766
00:47:47,899 --> 00:47:51,267
With a powerful and popular
saint like Mary Magdalene,

767
00:47:51,269 --> 00:47:56,239
the economic ramifications
were enormous.

768
00:48:03,581 --> 00:48:04,981
When I was writing my book,
people said to me

769
00:48:04,983 --> 00:48:07,917
why did I want to bother to write
a book about a prostitute,

770
00:48:07,919 --> 00:48:10,319
or a repentant prostitute
and I said I wasn't,

771
00:48:10,321 --> 00:48:11,821
and they said, "Well, what
are you writing about?"

772
00:48:11,823 --> 00:48:17,293
And I said, "Well, a woman in her own
right." Which is what I felt she was.

773
00:48:17,295 --> 00:48:17,660
Um...

774
00:48:17,662 --> 00:48:24,300
And when I finished my book, I was
so angry at what the Church had done

775
00:48:24,302 --> 00:48:28,871
to women
in the name of Christianity,

776
00:48:28,873 --> 00:48:31,474
I didn't want to
think about it any longer.

777
00:48:31,476 --> 00:48:35,611
I was stone-cold angry

778
00:48:35,613 --> 00:48:37,280
about what had happened to us.

779
00:48:37,282 --> 00:48:39,749
And having done Mary Magdalene,

780
00:48:39,751 --> 00:48:44,620
it showed what women could have
been in the last 2,000 years

781
00:48:44,622 --> 00:48:45,855
and what women can do now,

782
00:48:45,857 --> 00:48:49,425
and what men can understand
women to be able to do now.

783
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:55,464
The guilt of, uh, sexuality, and procreation
goes back to the Garden of Eden,

784
00:48:55,466 --> 00:48:58,167
<i>because Eve has eaten</i>
<i>of the apple,</i>

785
00:48:58,169 --> 00:49:00,569
<i>and Adam has eaten</i>
<i>of the apple, too,</i>

786
00:49:00,571 --> 00:49:02,305
<i>they're expelled</i>
<i>from the garden.</i>

787
00:49:02,307 --> 00:49:07,443
The blame of the guilt is heaped
solely and squarely upon woman,

788
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:11,714
upon Eve, rather than upon
just Adam and Eve.

789
00:49:11,849 --> 00:49:13,983
And we are living
with the consequences of that,

790
00:49:13,985 --> 00:49:16,886
and it's... it's
a very powerful story

791
00:49:16,888 --> 00:49:20,990
that affects so much
of the modern world.

792
00:49:20,992 --> 00:49:23,392
<i>More than 5,000 years ago,</i>

793
00:49:23,394 --> 00:49:27,229
<i>we began to rewrite</i>
<i>the ancient stories.</i>

794
00:49:27,231 --> 00:49:29,432
<i>In time, one God replaced many,</i>

795
00:49:29,434 --> 00:49:33,736
<i>and the Sacred Feminine</i>
<i>was changed into a temptress</i>

796
00:49:33,738 --> 00:49:35,905
<i>who brought sin into the world.</i>

797
00:49:35,907 --> 00:49:38,908
We've been taught a very, very
different form of Christianity,

798
00:49:38,910 --> 00:49:44,046
which was to do with blind belief
that somebody else had died

799
00:49:44,048 --> 00:49:47,149
for us because
we had original sin,

800
00:49:47,151 --> 00:49:49,452
and that if we just
believed that,

801
00:49:49,454 --> 00:49:51,120
then we'd go to heaven
when we died.

802
00:49:51,122 --> 00:49:54,523
And if we didn't,
we'd go to hell,

803
00:49:54,525 --> 00:49:58,094
and be tortured forever,
by a God of love.

804
00:49:58,096 --> 00:49:59,962
It's the last of
the acceptable prejudices,

805
00:49:59,964 --> 00:50:01,797
putting the boot
into the Catholic Church.

806
00:50:01,799 --> 00:50:05,468
And, I mean we have, there's
a big shadow side there,

807
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:10,139
but, I mean, if it's as bad as
that, why is it still there?

808
00:50:10,141 --> 00:50:12,341
People have
three hungers, really.

809
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:15,144
People want to live.
They want to find meaning,

810
00:50:15,146 --> 00:50:16,212
and want to love and be loved.

811
00:50:16,214 --> 00:50:21,217
I think the three basic human hungers
are for life, meaning and love.

812
00:50:21,219 --> 00:50:23,753
And I think faith, real faith,
answers those hungers.

813
00:50:23,755 --> 00:50:28,557
But as a Catholic Christian, I find
life and meaning and love in Jesus.

814
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:31,627
I mean, He satisfies
my hungry heart.

815
00:50:31,629 --> 00:50:34,764
The men of the formative
church were so terrified

816
00:50:34,766 --> 00:50:38,834
that Mary Magdalene's legacy would
come down through the centuries.

817
00:50:38,836 --> 00:50:40,069
They said, "We're not having
any more...

818
00:50:40,071 --> 00:50:42,338
"Any... Any likelihood
of another Mary Magdalene

819
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:44,507
"coming out of,
you know, the flock,

820
00:50:44,509 --> 00:50:48,511
"so we are going to suppress all women.
We're going to lie about it.

821
00:50:48,513 --> 00:50:50,980
"We're going to lie
about what Jesus said."

822
00:50:50,982 --> 00:50:53,449
And the whole
of the last 2,000 years

823
00:50:53,451 --> 00:50:57,520
has been a result of
t-the men of the Vatican,

824
00:50:57,522 --> 00:50:59,822
the very, very early
Church fathers essentially,

825
00:50:59,824 --> 00:51:04,226
about them reacting against
Mary Magdalene and her image.

826
00:51:04,228 --> 00:51:08,731
Well I... I love Mary Magdalene. I'm
a priest because of her really.

827
00:51:08,733 --> 00:51:09,765
My mother,
before she got married,

828
00:51:09,767 --> 00:51:13,035
went to the Church of Saint
Mary Magdalene in, uh, Paris,

829
00:51:13,037 --> 00:51:15,438
<i>and prayed that if she had
a son he'd be a priest.</i>

830
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,541
And I'm the result,
so I'm happy being a priest.

831
00:51:18,543 --> 00:51:19,675
I'm grateful to Mary Magdalene.

832
00:51:19,677 --> 00:51:23,712
The idea that she was vilified by the
official Church is just nonsense.

833
00:51:23,714 --> 00:51:25,347
I mean, here in Rome
we have a lovely church

834
00:51:25,349 --> 00:51:29,085
with Mary Magdalene very
prominent there on the facade.

835
00:51:29,087 --> 00:51:32,888
So, she's a very notable
figure in early Christianity

836
00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:37,026
and uh, remembered as such
with... with affection and gratitude.

837
00:51:37,028 --> 00:51:41,063
<i>In many ways, what books</i>
<i>like</i> The Da Vinci Code <i> do,</i>

838
00:51:41,065 --> 00:51:48,104
is it puts in, beginning, beginning,
beginning new storylines.

839
00:51:48,106 --> 00:51:49,672
Here's a new storyline.

840
00:51:49,674 --> 00:51:53,342
"Oh, Jesus was really married
and had a child."

841
00:51:53,344 --> 00:51:58,214
Now, right now,
that is as fanciful

842
00:51:58,216 --> 00:52:02,918
as any religious story one could
ever imagine when it was first told.

843
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:07,990
The interesting thing is, 500 years
from now, 1000 years from now,

844
00:52:07,992 --> 00:52:11,961
when millions of people
have heard that story,

845
00:52:11,963 --> 00:52:12,695
when in generations,

846
00:52:12,697 --> 00:52:18,400
it becomes a part of the expansive
nature of the earliest stories,

847
00:52:18,402 --> 00:52:19,502
it just gets grafted on,

848
00:52:19,504 --> 00:52:22,171
and then we see how it
begins to affect society.

849
00:52:22,173 --> 00:52:26,509
I think <i> The Da Vinci Code</i> has done a great
job, uh, because it stirred things up.

850
00:52:26,511 --> 00:52:32,948
I think it's a great sign that people are no
longer happy with the traditional history

851
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:33,883
and meaning of Christianity.

852
00:52:33,885 --> 00:52:37,486
And it's pointed quite rightly to the
fact that that traditional history

853
00:52:37,488 --> 00:52:38,687
just does not stand up
to scrutiny.

854
00:52:38,689 --> 00:52:42,324
But it's, uh, it... it in
itself, is very superficial.

855
00:52:42,326 --> 00:52:47,630
It itself created... Creates a whole new
mythology, which it then literalizes

856
00:52:47,632 --> 00:52:50,432
which is this... this idea,
that Mary comes to France

857
00:52:50,434 --> 00:52:52,401
and... and there's a bloodline
and all this.

858
00:52:52,403 --> 00:52:53,536
There's no evidence for that.

859
00:52:53,538 --> 00:52:54,370
How depressing would that be,

860
00:52:54,372 --> 00:52:59,575
if all of these people throughout
history had risked their lives

861
00:52:59,577 --> 00:53:01,177
to keep
this precious secret alive.

862
00:53:01,179 --> 00:53:02,244
And it was
an aristocratic bloodline,

863
00:53:02,246 --> 00:53:05,648
just at the point where we're going,
"We don't need that anymore."

864
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:08,684
In fact, the real Da Vinci Code
is much more shocking than that

865
00:53:08,686 --> 00:53:12,521
because, um, you know, basically
Leonardo was saying, um,

866
00:53:12,523 --> 00:53:14,390
Jesus was a fake messiah.

867
00:53:14,392 --> 00:53:16,592
Leonardo da Vinci
was in fact a Johannite.

868
00:53:16,594 --> 00:53:21,730
He believed that John the
Baptist was the true Messiah,

869
00:53:21,732 --> 00:53:22,298
<i>not Jesus.</i>

870
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:26,969
One of the most Johannite, uh,
works of Leonardo da Vinci,

871
00:53:26,971 --> 00:53:28,537
is <i> The Adoration of the Magi.</i>

872
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:31,540
<i>So in... in the foreground</i>
<i>you have the wise men</i>

873
00:53:31,542 --> 00:53:34,577
<i>and they're presenting</i>
<i>frankincense and myrrh</i>

874
00:53:34,579 --> 00:53:35,978
<i>and you think, "Wait a minute,</i>
<i>where's the gold?"</i>

875
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:40,249
In Leonardo's time, gold represented
perfection and kingship

876
00:53:40,251 --> 00:53:42,651
so that's being withheld
from the baby Jesus.

877
00:53:42,653 --> 00:53:47,523
<i>Look above the Virgin Mary</i>
<i>to, behind her, essentially,</i>

878
00:53:47,525 --> 00:53:48,657
<i>and there's</i>
<i>the roots of a tree.</i>

879
00:53:48,659 --> 00:53:51,894
<i>There's a tree. Um, a carob tree
represents John the Baptist</i>

880
00:53:51,896 --> 00:53:56,298
and there's a group of young
people standing around this tree,

881
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:58,701
worshiping, or apparently
worshiping this tree.

882
00:53:58,703 --> 00:54:01,971
And these young people are,
uh, well, obviously young,

883
00:54:01,973 --> 00:54:04,773
and they're vibrant
and healthy and glowing

884
00:54:04,775 --> 00:54:06,875
and they're the John the
Baptist's worshipers,

885
00:54:06,877 --> 00:54:12,114
but the Jesus worshipers in the
foreground are horrible, old things.

886
00:54:12,116 --> 00:54:14,149
<i>To be fascinated</i>
<i>with a Christian saint</i>

887
00:54:14,151 --> 00:54:16,252
<i>is not heresy in itself,</i>
<i>of course.</i>

888
00:54:16,254 --> 00:54:19,121
But to be fascinated
and obsessed to the point

889
00:54:19,123 --> 00:54:24,693
where you believe that that
saint is superior to Jesus,

890
00:54:24,695 --> 00:54:26,328
that's heresy.

891
00:54:26,330 --> 00:54:28,731
<i>Heresy means choice in Greek</i>

892
00:54:28,733 --> 00:54:32,401
<i>but for the church,</i>
<i>it came to mean the enemy.</i>

893
00:54:32,403 --> 00:54:35,337
<i>Philosophers</i>
<i>with unorthodox views,</i>

894
00:54:35,339 --> 00:54:38,340
<i>noblemen who disobeyed</i>
<i>papal edicts</i>

895
00:54:38,342 --> 00:54:41,443
<i>people accused</i>
<i>of being witches.</i>

896
00:54:41,445 --> 00:54:45,514
Dan Brown tells us
that the Catholic Church

897
00:54:45,516 --> 00:54:47,549
burned five million witches
at the stake.

898
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:50,786
That would have depopulated Europe.
I mean, it's absurd.

899
00:54:50,788 --> 00:54:54,089
In fact, about 50,000
women and men

900
00:54:54,091 --> 00:54:58,827
died over all the centuries in...
At Salem and a-also in Europe.

901
00:54:58,829 --> 00:55:01,864
And that was evil and wicked,
but five million,

902
00:55:01,866 --> 00:55:05,734
I mean, he... he multiplies the real number
by a hundred, because it sounds much better.

903
00:55:05,736 --> 00:55:10,005
I mean, there were things about the
Spanish Inquisition which are not good,

904
00:55:10,007 --> 00:55:10,673
but there were things...

905
00:55:10,675 --> 00:55:14,743
At that time many people preferred
to have their case heard by them,

906
00:55:14,745 --> 00:55:16,679
because they thought
they'd get justice.

907
00:55:16,681 --> 00:55:20,282
And the number of people executed
by the Inquisition was minuscule.

908
00:55:20,284 --> 00:55:23,986
I mean, it's, uh... Somehow
it got a very bad name.

909
00:55:23,988 --> 00:55:29,958
<i>No one was safe from the church's
pursuit of spiritual purity.</i>

910
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,060
<i>Not even an order of knights</i>

911
00:55:31,062 --> 00:55:36,732
<i>that had been formed to protect
pilgrims traveling to the Holy Land.</i>

912
00:55:36,734 --> 00:55:37,399
The Knights Templar

913
00:55:37,401 --> 00:55:40,369
are traditionally said to have
been a group of nine knights

914
00:55:40,371 --> 00:55:45,641
<i>who were formed in the Holy Land
around the year 1118 or 1119.</i>

915
00:55:45,643 --> 00:55:49,044
The non-orthodox, or the speculative
version of the Templar story

916
00:55:49,046 --> 00:55:54,383
<i>holds that the Templars requested to
be based on the... the Temple platform</i>

917
00:55:54,385 --> 00:55:56,352
<i>so that they could actually</i>
<i>carry out excavations</i>

918
00:55:56,354 --> 00:55:59,621
<i>underneath what they believed</i>
<i>was the Temple of Solomon.</i>

919
00:55:59,623 --> 00:56:00,923
<i>Well, those writers</i>
<i>would suggest</i>

920
00:56:00,925 --> 00:56:02,224
<i>that the Templars</i>
<i>did find some documents</i>

921
00:56:02,226 --> 00:56:05,594
<i>that proved something about
the origins of Christianity</i>

922
00:56:05,596 --> 00:56:09,898
<i>which they then used as a
bargaining tool back in Europe.</i>

923
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:10,733
<i>They initially had no money,</i>

924
00:56:10,735 --> 00:56:12,735
<i>they were basically very
impoverished to start with</i>

925
00:56:12,737 --> 00:56:15,270
<i>and then they became</i>
<i>very successful.</i>

926
00:56:15,272 --> 00:56:16,372
<i>Within about 10 or 15 years,</i>

927
00:56:16,374 --> 00:56:20,509
the Templars were,
by modern day equivalence,

928
00:56:20,511 --> 00:56:22,544
um, sort of multi-millionaires.

929
00:56:22,546 --> 00:56:23,479
<i>In some stories,</i>

930
00:56:23,481 --> 00:56:26,949
<i>the Templars were said to be the
guardians of the Holy Grail.</i>

931
00:56:26,951 --> 00:56:30,018
<i>But it was tales of secret
rites and heretical beliefs,</i>

932
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:33,589
<i>that, in time,</i>
<i>led to their destruction.</i>

933
00:56:33,591 --> 00:56:37,126
Well, on Friday,
the 13th of October, 1307,

934
00:56:37,128 --> 00:56:37,960
all of the Templars in France

935
00:56:37,962 --> 00:56:42,030
were arrested on the orders of the
French king, Philip the Fair,

936
00:56:42,032 --> 00:56:44,700
on the grounds of
heresy basically.

937
00:56:44,702 --> 00:56:47,302
Uh, denying Christ,
spitting on the cross,

938
00:56:47,304 --> 00:56:51,340
institutional sodomy,
worshiping a devil...

939
00:56:51,342 --> 00:56:54,243
<i>A group of charges</i>
<i>that was pretty severe.</i>

940
00:56:54,245 --> 00:56:58,113
<i>Within a few years,</i>
<i>the Templars were gone.</i>

941
00:56:58,115 --> 00:57:00,382
<i>Either killed or in exile.</i>

942
00:57:00,384 --> 00:57:04,086
<i>Today all that remains,</i>
<i>are their ties to the Grail</i>

943
00:57:04,088 --> 00:57:06,722
<i>and the places they built.</i>

944
00:57:06,724 --> 00:57:07,523
<i>Following a false clue,</i>

945
00:57:07,525 --> 00:57:11,527
<i>Robert Langdon and Sophie
Neveu come to Temple Church</i>

946
00:57:11,529 --> 00:57:14,663
<i>where they encounter</i>
<i>a murderous albino monk</i>

947
00:57:14,665 --> 00:57:15,364
<i>who belongs to Opus Dei,</i>

948
00:57:15,366 --> 00:57:20,436
<i>another secret organization that
has been viewed with suspicion.</i>

949
00:57:20,438 --> 00:57:23,372
I mean, there have been conspiracy
theories about Opus Dei

950
00:57:23,374 --> 00:57:24,373
since the late 1920s.

951
00:57:24,375 --> 00:57:25,340
<i>But what Dan Brown did, is,</i>

952
00:57:25,342 --> 00:57:27,476
<i>he took those conspiracy
theories to the mass market.</i>

953
00:57:27,478 --> 00:57:30,446
And then they've got to
ask themselves the question,

954
00:57:30,448 --> 00:57:32,247
"Why are so many people
willing to believe

955
00:57:32,249 --> 00:57:34,116
"that they are this kind of
Darth Vader-esque,

956
00:57:34,118 --> 00:57:36,318
"you know, boogie-man who
is hiding under the bed

957
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:41,490
"of every nefarious thing that
happens in the Catholic Church?"

958
00:57:43,894 --> 00:57:46,495
Well, Opus Dei is portrayed,
uh, completely distorted

959
00:57:46,497 --> 00:57:52,034
and there's no reality at all based on what
he's written and the reality of Opus Dei.

960
00:57:52,036 --> 00:57:56,104
Uh, first of all, there
are no monks in Opus Dei,

961
00:57:56,106 --> 00:57:58,106
albino or otherwise.

962
00:57:58,108 --> 00:57:59,741
I got hooked
on the book myself.

963
00:57:59,743 --> 00:58:03,412
I... I... I wondered who on
earth is the evil teacher.

964
00:58:03,414 --> 00:58:06,548
I didn't like the fact
that the killer was an albino.

965
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:07,916
That's... That's not very nice.

966
00:58:07,918 --> 00:58:09,585
I mean, there are
albinos in our world.

967
00:58:09,587 --> 00:58:12,354
One of my colleagues
is an albino.

968
00:58:12,356 --> 00:58:13,121
It's a group of lay people

969
00:58:13,123 --> 00:58:17,226
and, uh, it has nothing to do with
people running around in religious garb

970
00:58:17,228 --> 00:58:21,063
or being cloistered
in convents or monasteries.

971
00:58:21,065 --> 00:58:25,033
<i>Opus Dei is all about</i>
<i>a way of finding God</i>

972
00:58:25,035 --> 00:58:27,202
<i>in work</i>
<i>and in your ordinary life.</i>

973
00:58:27,204 --> 00:58:28,837
<i>That's its essence.</i>

974
00:58:28,839 --> 00:58:30,038
One of the problems
of Opus Dei is,

975
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:31,940
it's not so much they're
secretive, they're just unique.

976
00:58:31,942 --> 00:58:34,343
<i>They do things in a way</i>
<i>that is very different</i>

977
00:58:34,345 --> 00:58:35,911
than how most secular
organizations do business.

978
00:58:35,913 --> 00:58:38,881
And it's hard for people on
the outside to understand.

979
00:58:38,883 --> 00:58:41,817
Uh, but, on the other hand,
it is also historically true

980
00:58:41,819 --> 00:58:44,119
that they had been
very leery about outsiders

981
00:58:44,121 --> 00:58:46,989
and leery about curiosity
and so forth.

982
00:58:46,991 --> 00:58:48,957
Not that intrigue
and conspiracy theories

983
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:51,226
haven't been around
for a long, long time,

984
00:58:51,228 --> 00:58:53,662
but, look around,
everything you see.

985
00:58:53,664 --> 00:58:56,131
Do I know the truth?
Do I know the story?

986
00:58:56,133 --> 00:58:58,200
Uh, what if I believe this,
am I a dupe?

987
00:58:58,202 --> 00:59:00,168
You think that you've got
some discernment,

988
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:03,772
some intelligence about you if you
can question everything you see.

989
00:59:03,774 --> 00:59:08,143
You have a... An enormous range of
people out there in the secular world

990
00:59:08,145 --> 00:59:11,013
who are hostile to,
skeptical of,

991
00:59:11,015 --> 00:59:13,015
uh, institutional Christianity
in such a profound way

992
00:59:13,017 --> 00:59:17,853
that they are willing in some ways,
to swallow a... a version of events

993
00:59:17,855 --> 00:59:19,354
that is
just demonstrably false,

994
00:59:19,356 --> 00:59:23,525
but nevertheless, they find that more
appealing and in some ways more credible

995
00:59:23,527 --> 00:59:25,794
than the story that is being
peddled by officialdom.

996
00:59:25,796 --> 00:59:28,163
Uh, and therefore I think, the
kind of examination of conscience

997
00:59:28,165 --> 00:59:32,200
that has to go on within
institutional Christian churches is,

998
00:59:32,202 --> 00:59:33,335
"Why is that?"

999
00:59:42,813 --> 00:59:46,715
<i>From what we know</i>
<i>of the human condition</i>

1000
00:59:46,717 --> 00:59:47,849
<i>and human experience,</i>

1001
00:59:47,851 --> 00:59:51,820
it is more plausible that a man
should lay claim to a throne,

1002
00:59:51,822 --> 00:59:54,022
be married and have children,

1003
00:59:54,024 --> 00:59:56,091
than that he should be
born of a virgin,

1004
00:59:56,093 --> 00:59:59,194
walk on water
and rise from the dead.

1005
00:59:59,797 --> 01:00:04,366
<i>25 years ago, Richard Leigh,
Michael Baigent and Henry Lincoln</i>

1006
01:00:04,368 --> 01:00:09,571
<i>wrote a book that includes much
of the intellectual architecture</i>

1007
01:00:09,573 --> 01:00:12,574
<i>underlying</i> The Da Vinci Code.

1008
01:00:12,977 --> 01:00:17,212
The chief components
of our hypothesis were,

1009
01:00:17,514 --> 01:00:19,948
one, that Jesus
had a rightful claim

1010
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:21,183
to the throne of Palestine
at the time.

1011
01:00:21,185 --> 01:00:26,755
Secondly, that like any Jew of his
time, like any man of his time,

1012
01:00:26,757 --> 01:00:30,859
in that context,
he would have been married.

1013
01:00:30,861 --> 01:00:35,430
Thirdly, if he was married,
there would have been children.

1014
01:00:35,432 --> 01:00:41,503
Fourthly, the Magdalene
escaped Palestine

1015
01:00:41,505 --> 01:00:43,438
and landed
in the south of France.

1016
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:48,810
If she had a child, or if she
were pregnant with a child,

1017
01:00:48,812 --> 01:00:49,878
yeah, uh, Jesus' bloodline

1018
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:53,181
would have, uh, been transplanted
to France along with her.

1019
01:00:53,183 --> 01:00:56,952
That bloodline, descended
from the Magdalene and Jesus,

1020
01:00:56,954 --> 01:01:00,255
intermarried with
the royal line of the Franks,

1021
01:01:00,257 --> 01:01:03,959
from which arose
the Merovingian Dynasty.

1022
01:01:04,361 --> 01:01:05,460
Holy Blood, Holy Grail

1023
01:01:05,462 --> 01:01:09,531
<i>was based on a set of documents
called the Secret Files,</i>

1024
01:01:09,533 --> 01:01:13,135
<i>which contained genealogies</i>
<i>linking Jesus and Mary</i>

1025
01:01:13,137 --> 01:01:15,971
<i>to the Merovingian Royal Family</i>

1026
01:01:15,973 --> 01:01:17,406
<i>and to the Priory of Sion,</i>

1027
01:01:17,408 --> 01:01:22,711
<i>a secret society dedicated</i>
<i>to protecting this bloodline.</i>

1028
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:25,347
We knew, uh,
there was a secret society,

1029
01:01:25,349 --> 01:01:28,183
or semi-secret society
in France.

1030
01:01:28,185 --> 01:01:32,220
We didn't know how powerful
they actually were.

1031
01:01:32,222 --> 01:01:32,822
We still don't.

1032
01:01:32,823 --> 01:01:34,589
We were mystified
by their agenda,

1033
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:35,724
we were mystified by the fact

1034
01:01:35,726 --> 01:01:38,527
that here were a group
of people in France,

1035
01:01:38,529 --> 01:01:40,862
some of whom
were very well connected,

1036
01:01:40,864 --> 01:01:44,366
some of whom had access
to the corridors of power,

1037
01:01:44,368 --> 01:01:49,938
whose stated objective was to
restore the Merovingian bloodline.

1038
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:51,673
That sounded bonkers.

1039
01:01:51,675 --> 01:01:56,511
Baigent, Leigh and Lincoln got talking
to a guy called Pierre Plantard,

1040
01:01:56,513 --> 01:02:00,816
<i>who claimed to be the Grand
Master of the Priory of Sion.</i>

1041
01:02:00,818 --> 01:02:01,616
<i>Plantard saw himself</i>

1042
01:02:01,618 --> 01:02:05,787
<i>as the last of an illustrious
line of Grand Masters</i>

1043
01:02:05,789 --> 01:02:08,123
<i>which included Isaac Newton,</i>

1044
01:02:08,125 --> 01:02:08,724
<i>Jean Cocteau,</i>

1045
01:02:08,726 --> 01:02:12,294
<i>and of course,</i>
<i>Leonardo da Vinci.</i>

1046
01:02:13,397 --> 01:02:13,995
Pierre Plantard,

1047
01:02:13,997 --> 01:02:17,332
he wanted to be king of
France or savior of France.

1048
01:02:17,334 --> 01:02:21,536
<i>And after</i> Holy Blood,
Holy Grail <i> came out,</i>

1049
01:02:22,539 --> 01:02:23,505
uh, the stakes were raised

1050
01:02:23,507 --> 01:02:28,143
and, uh, he decided
he would like to also be

1051
01:02:28,145 --> 01:02:31,246
a descendant of
Jesus and Mary Magdalene.

1052
01:02:31,248 --> 01:02:38,653
Uh, I think the man died without
convincing anyone at all of his claims,

1053
01:02:38,655 --> 01:02:42,524
but I always thought
he was tuned into something

1054
01:02:42,526 --> 01:02:45,761
and that it was hidden
behind the Priory of Sion.

1055
01:02:45,763 --> 01:02:51,867
So everyone's kind of swung between,
you know, one end of two extremes.

1056
01:02:51,869 --> 01:02:57,305
It's either kind of believe everything
about the, uh, Priory of Sion

1057
01:02:57,307 --> 01:02:59,341
that you read
in <i> The Da Vinci Code,</i>

1058
01:02:59,343 --> 01:03:01,643
or that it's all just
this cheap modern hoax.

1059
01:03:01,645 --> 01:03:06,414
Um, in fact, the research that we've
done shows it's neither of those.

1060
01:03:06,416 --> 01:03:10,819
There was no Priory of Sion
in Leonardo da Vinci's day.

1061
01:03:10,821 --> 01:03:13,288
It only...
It was only formed in 1956.

1062
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:16,191
So, Leonardo died in 1519,
so there's a bit of a gap.

1063
01:03:16,193 --> 01:03:21,763
Um, but, um, I don't know whether
Leonardo was Grand Master of anything.

1064
01:03:21,765 --> 01:03:25,700
Um, but if anybody should
have been, he should.

1065
01:03:25,836 --> 01:03:28,036
<i>On page one</i>
<i>of</i> The Da Vinci Code,

1066
01:03:28,038 --> 01:03:31,840
<i>Dan Brown asserts</i>
<i>the Priory is real.</i>

1067
01:03:31,842 --> 01:03:35,243
<i>Others, however, disagree.</i>

1068
01:03:37,748 --> 01:03:39,481
The Church
makes a point of saying

1069
01:03:39,483 --> 01:03:42,884
that contrary to fancible allegations
in a recent best seller,

1070
01:03:42,886 --> 01:03:48,924
that the P and the S, the two
letters in the small round windows

1071
01:03:48,926 --> 01:03:50,091
at both ends of the transit

1072
01:03:50,093 --> 01:03:54,095
refer to Saint Peter
and Saint Sulpice,

1073
01:03:54,097 --> 01:03:55,130
patron saints of the Church

1074
01:03:55,132 --> 01:03:59,334
and not to what they call
an imaginary Priory of Sion.

1075
01:03:59,336 --> 01:04:03,071
Now, of course, the Priory
of Sion is not imaginary

1076
01:04:03,073 --> 01:04:05,907
but the question is, whether
it has anything whatever to do

1077
01:04:05,909 --> 01:04:10,111
with what we're looking
at here at the moment.

1078
01:04:10,214 --> 01:04:13,849
<i>Did the Priory of Sion</i>
<i>really exist?</i>

1079
01:04:13,851 --> 01:04:19,187
<i>Was there a succession of Grand Masters
protecting a sacred bloodline?</i>

1080
01:04:19,189 --> 01:04:23,291
Did Leonardo include a woman
in <i> The Last Supper?</i>

1081
01:04:23,293 --> 01:04:27,062
<i>For that matter,</i>
<i>did Moses part the waters?</i>

1082
01:04:27,064 --> 01:04:29,397
<i>Did Jesus rise from the dead?</i>

1083
01:04:29,399 --> 01:04:34,903
<i>When and how does a story</i>
<i>become sacred doctrine?</i>

1084
01:04:35,305 --> 01:04:38,940
<i>Many of the intrigues that run
through</i> The Da Vinci Code

1085
01:04:38,942 --> 01:04:43,078
<i>come together in a town</i>
<i>in the south of France.</i>

1086
01:04:43,447 --> 01:04:46,014
<i>We don't know</i>
<i>which of them are true,</i>

1087
01:04:46,016 --> 01:04:49,985
<i>but we do know they inspired
Dan Brown and Richard Leigh</i>

1088
01:04:49,987 --> 01:04:55,223
<i>and fired the imaginations</i>
<i>of readers around the world.</i>

1089
01:04:56,493 --> 01:05:03,164
In 1890,
a backwoods yokel priest

1090
01:05:03,166 --> 01:05:04,532
<i>in a backwoods village,</i>

1091
01:05:04,534 --> 01:05:05,867
<i>in the foothills</i>
<i>of the Pyrenees,</i>

1092
01:05:05,869 --> 01:05:11,706
<i>suddenly and mysteriously coming up
with the equivalent of £37 million.</i>

1093
01:05:11,708 --> 01:05:13,642
<i>Where did the money come from?</i>

1094
01:05:13,644 --> 01:05:14,576
<i>What did he discover?</i>

1095
01:05:14,578 --> 01:05:17,812
<i>A treasure, or a secret,</i>
<i>or both?</i>

1096
01:05:18,782 --> 01:05:22,651
Berenger Sauniere was a young priest.
He was 33 when he was posted

1097
01:05:22,653 --> 01:05:24,386
to Rennes le Chateau.

1098
01:05:24,388 --> 01:05:27,889
After a few years his bishop
sends him to Narbonne.

1099
01:05:27,891 --> 01:05:30,625
And I think this is when
a deal was made

1100
01:05:30,627 --> 01:05:35,530
between Berenger Sauniere and those who
wanted to find something over here.

1101
01:05:35,532 --> 01:05:41,369
When he came back he had in
his pocket 3,000 gold francs

1102
01:05:41,371 --> 01:05:45,173
which had been given to him by the
niece of the Emperor of Austria.

1103
01:05:45,175 --> 01:05:49,344
We are talking of the most powerful
man in the world at the time

1104
01:05:49,346 --> 01:05:53,481
and that man is interested in
something at Rennes le Chateau

1105
01:05:53,483 --> 01:05:55,517
and he's willing to pay.

1106
01:05:55,519 --> 01:06:00,121
So they knew some documents
of the highest importance

1107
01:06:00,123 --> 01:06:01,790
had been left, hidden.

1108
01:06:01,792 --> 01:06:07,195
They needed somebody they could
trust to find them again...

1109
01:06:07,197 --> 01:06:12,067
and Berenger Sauniere was the
right man in the right post.

1110
01:06:12,069 --> 01:06:16,738
<i>Dan Brown chose to name the
man murdered at the Louvre</i>

1111
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:18,873
<i>after Berenger Sauniere.</i>

1112
01:06:18,875 --> 01:06:23,712
<i>Both men had access</i>
<i>to secret knowledge</i>

1113
01:06:23,714 --> 01:06:26,281
<i>and both</i>
<i>feared for their lives.</i>

1114
01:06:26,283 --> 01:06:31,586
From the moment he has found
something, yes, he is immensely rich

1115
01:06:31,588 --> 01:06:35,690
but on the other hand,
he's frightened.

1116
01:06:35,692 --> 01:06:37,492
He locks himself in the house.

1117
01:06:37,494 --> 01:06:40,061
He spends days and days locked
in the Tour Magdala.

1118
01:06:40,063 --> 01:06:42,430
He doesn't meet with
the people in the village.

1119
01:06:42,432 --> 01:06:43,565
And he's right
to be frightened.

1120
01:06:43,567 --> 01:06:47,402
Did you know that two of his
closest friends were murdered?

1121
01:06:47,838 --> 01:06:48,803
<i>Murdered.</i>

1122
01:06:48,805 --> 01:06:51,539
<i>Presumably for knowing about</i>
<i>the documents</i>

1123
01:06:51,541 --> 01:06:54,242
<i>that Sauniere</i>
<i>had been paid to dig up.</i>

1124
01:06:54,244 --> 01:06:57,278
<i>Legend links these documents</i>
<i>to the Cathars,</i>

1125
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:00,415
<i>a sect of Christians</i>
<i>who flourished in the region</i>

1126
01:07:00,417 --> 01:07:02,817
<i>during the 11th</i>
<i>and 12th century.</i>

1127
01:07:02,819 --> 01:07:05,186
<i>The Cathars were considered</i>
<i>so heretical,</i>

1128
01:07:05,188 --> 01:07:09,057
<i>that they were subject to the
first crusade against Christians.</i>

1129
01:07:09,059 --> 01:07:13,661
The military campaign against the
Cathars and their supporters,

1130
01:07:13,663 --> 01:07:14,629
effectively finished

1131
01:07:14,631 --> 01:07:18,199
and what actually took its
place was the Inquisition.

1132
01:07:18,201 --> 01:07:21,536
<i>The Inquisition was formed</i>
<i>to root out heresy,</i>

1133
01:07:21,538 --> 01:07:22,570
<i>to root out Catharism,</i>

1134
01:07:22,572 --> 01:07:25,774
<i>and to instruct people</i>
<i>in the ways of righteousness.</i>

1135
01:07:25,776 --> 01:07:30,045
<i>Mont Segur then became the last
stronghold of the Cathars,</i>

1136
01:07:30,047 --> 01:07:31,846
<i>and there was</i>
<i>a long standoff in 1243,</i>

1137
01:07:31,848 --> 01:07:38,820
<i>where the French crown and the crusading
soldiers surrounded Mont Segur.</i>

1138
01:07:38,822 --> 01:07:40,655
<i>One of the interesting myths</i>
<i>about Mont Segur,</i>

1139
01:07:40,657 --> 01:07:44,826
<i>is that the... That the
Cathars possessed a treasure,</i>

1140
01:07:44,828 --> 01:07:47,729
<i>which some people have thought</i>
<i>was the Holy Grail.</i>

1141
01:07:47,731 --> 01:07:51,366
So this is another link between
the Templars and the Cathars,

1142
01:07:51,368 --> 01:07:54,903
because the Templars were also
traditionally said to have been

1143
01:07:54,905 --> 01:07:57,038
the guardians
of the Holy Grail.

1144
01:07:57,974 --> 01:07:59,441
The end of the
Cathar movement was close.

1145
01:07:59,443 --> 01:08:03,745
They were surrounded by the armies of the
King of France and they had to surrender.

1146
01:08:03,747 --> 01:08:07,015
Four Cathars escaped
from Mont Segur at night.

1147
01:08:07,017 --> 01:08:08,850
They climbed down
the rocks on ropes

1148
01:08:08,852 --> 01:08:12,754
and took away what is alleged to
be the treasure of the Cathars.

1149
01:08:12,756 --> 01:08:16,524
The Cathars were known to have
smuggled something out of Mont Segur

1150
01:08:16,526 --> 01:08:18,793
shortly before
the citadel fell.

1151
01:08:18,795 --> 01:08:22,630
So, whatever it was
that the Cathars smuggled out,

1152
01:08:22,632 --> 01:08:23,331
was never seen again.

1153
01:08:23,333 --> 01:08:27,635
When you mention treasure, people think
of gold, jewels, material treasure.

1154
01:08:27,637 --> 01:08:32,307
The treasure was a spiritual
treasure, probably it was documents

1155
01:08:32,309 --> 01:08:35,276
something written
which they had kept secret

1156
01:08:35,278 --> 01:08:38,746
on which they based their religion
and they had to keep it safe.

1157
01:08:38,748 --> 01:08:39,747
They knew their end was coming

1158
01:08:39,749 --> 01:08:45,687
and it was more important to them to save
those documents than to save their lives.

1159
01:08:45,689 --> 01:08:47,322
Is it something to do
with what the Cathars knew?

1160
01:08:47,324 --> 01:08:51,993
With the revelation that Mary Magdalene
was not just the prostitute?

1161
01:08:51,995 --> 01:08:57,365
Did she play a much more important
role in the life of Christ?

1162
01:08:57,367 --> 01:09:00,401
Maybe Berenger Sauniere
found the proof of that.

1163
01:09:00,403 --> 01:09:04,806
Maybe he found documents, maybe he
found the papers which prove that.

1164
01:09:04,808 --> 01:09:08,543
Everything points towards
Mary Magdalene.

1165
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:11,913
<i>We don't know</i>
<i>what the Knights Templar found</i>

1166
01:09:11,915 --> 01:09:14,215
<i>under the ruins</i>
<i>of the second temple,</i>

1167
01:09:14,217 --> 01:09:17,218
<i>what the Cathars smuggled out</i>
<i>from Mont Segur,</i>

1168
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:21,890
<i>or what Sauniere unearthed</i>
<i>at Rennes Le Chateau.</i>

1169
01:09:21,892 --> 01:09:22,524
<i>All we know</i>

1170
01:09:22,526 --> 01:09:26,794
<i>is that secrets compel people</i>
<i>to reveal them.</i>

1171
01:09:26,796 --> 01:09:27,595
<i>Not openly,</i>

1172
01:09:27,597 --> 01:09:31,933
<i>but in codes, ciphers,</i>
<i>and symbols.</i>

1173
01:09:32,869 --> 01:09:34,869
He left messages and clues everywhere,
desperately trying to tell us something

1174
01:09:34,871 --> 01:09:39,274
or trying to tell to those who were able to
understand, those who were able to cope...

1175
01:09:39,276 --> 01:09:43,545
with the news, something, and
keep the secret at the same time.

1176
01:09:43,547 --> 01:09:49,150
Let me show you a few things. It's unusual
to be welcomed in a church by a devil

1177
01:09:49,152 --> 01:09:50,952
and look who's there.

1178
01:09:50,954 --> 01:09:53,855
You know the Cathars
said that the world

1179
01:09:53,857 --> 01:09:57,392
had been created not by God,
but by the devil.

1180
01:09:57,394 --> 01:10:04,299
This is the perfect answer to those
who say, "Well if your God is so good

1181
01:10:04,301 --> 01:10:09,003
why has he created such a world
where there are murders and wars

1182
01:10:09,005 --> 01:10:11,973
and why does mankind
behave so badly?"

1183
01:10:11,975 --> 01:10:14,375
Behind the altar on your left
and on your right

1184
01:10:14,377 --> 01:10:19,314
you have a statue of Joseph
holding baby Jesus.

1185
01:10:19,316 --> 01:10:23,084
Virgin Mother and she's
holding another baby Jesus.

1186
01:10:23,086 --> 01:10:27,355
Two baby Jesus. And that's another
thing the Cathars used to say.

1187
01:10:27,357 --> 01:10:32,493
They used to say that Christ had a brother.
Another clue, another sign.

1188
01:10:32,495 --> 01:10:35,530
The Burial of Christ.
Everything seems to be normal.

1189
01:10:35,532 --> 01:10:38,700
Look at the top of the picture.
Look in the sky on the left.

1190
01:10:38,702 --> 01:10:44,005
What do you see there? The full moon has
been added by Berenger Sauniere himself.

1191
01:10:44,007 --> 01:10:46,975
If there is a full moon,
it means we are at night.

1192
01:10:46,977 --> 01:10:51,646
The Jewish religion forbids
to bury after the sunset.

1193
01:10:51,648 --> 01:10:56,884
Christ dies on a Friday. On
Friday sunset, Shabbat starts.

1194
01:10:56,886 --> 01:11:00,455
They're not burying Christ,
they are taking him away.

1195
01:11:00,457 --> 01:11:07,228
If they take him away during the night,
then it means that he's maybe not dead.

1196
01:11:07,230 --> 01:11:13,668
He never died on the cross. And that also
is something that the Cathars said...

1197
01:11:13,670 --> 01:11:17,672
that Christ survived
his crucifixion.

1198
01:11:17,874 --> 01:11:22,176
<i>The origins of the Cathars</i>
<i>remain cloaked in mystery.</i>

1199
01:11:22,178 --> 01:11:25,213
<i>But their end</i>
<i>was all too clear.</i>

1200
01:11:25,215 --> 01:11:29,951
<i>Surrounded by the French army,</i>
<i>they were given a choice.</i>

1201
01:11:30,887 --> 01:11:35,623
At the very last minute they were always
offered the choice in front of the fire...

1202
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:39,794
to renounce their religion
and none of them did.

1203
01:11:39,796 --> 01:11:41,863
They all jumped at Mont Segur,
more than 200 people

1204
01:11:41,865 --> 01:11:49,865
men, women, kids jumped into the
flames singing canticles and praying.

1205
01:11:59,916 --> 01:12:04,052
I believe that there is
a biological human urge

1206
01:12:04,054 --> 01:12:08,956
to understand who we are and what
we are doing on this planet.

1207
01:12:08,958 --> 01:12:12,493
And in some ways,
<i>The Da Vinci Code,</i>

1208
01:12:12,495 --> 01:12:13,127
the word, "code",

1209
01:12:13,129 --> 01:12:16,297
has something to do with the
genetic code and the DNA code

1210
01:12:16,299 --> 01:12:22,637
<i>and what makes us think the things
we think and the ideas that we have.</i>

1211
01:12:22,839 --> 01:12:27,375
<i>And what happens, it may be
a flaw in our genetic code,</i>

1212
01:12:27,377 --> 01:12:30,211
<i>is that we become wedded</i>
<i>to certain beliefs</i>

1213
01:12:30,213 --> 01:12:32,680
<i>and certain tellings</i>
<i>of these stories.</i>

1214
01:12:32,682 --> 01:12:37,652
<i>People are willing to die for a
certain interpretation of the story.</i>

1215
01:12:37,654 --> 01:12:42,790
<i>And people are willing to kill for a
certain interpretation of the story.</i>

1216
01:12:42,792 --> 01:12:43,324
<i>And at bottom,</i>

1217
01:12:43,326 --> 01:12:45,960
<i>all these stories have much
more in common with each other</i>

1218
01:12:45,962 --> 01:12:47,829
<i>because they are all</i>
<i>trying to explain</i>

1219
01:12:47,831 --> 01:12:52,767
<i>the special nature of life</i>
<i>and of the human experience.</i>

1220
01:12:55,071 --> 01:12:58,606
<i>The act of</i>
<i>sacrificing one's life for God</i>

1221
01:12:58,608 --> 01:13:01,275
<i>is repeated throughout history,</i>

1222
01:13:02,045 --> 01:13:05,713
<i>among all people, all nations,</i>

1223
01:13:05,715 --> 01:13:07,515
<i>all religions.</i>

1224
01:13:09,185 --> 01:13:13,488
This was a symbol of resistance.
This was a place in 66 AD,

1225
01:13:13,490 --> 01:13:16,524
a small band of Jews came up here,
chased the Romans out of here

1226
01:13:16,526 --> 01:13:21,229
and then three years later, the Romans
decided to set up a siege camp here.

1227
01:13:21,231 --> 01:13:24,465
We can see the camps. We can
see three camps over here,

1228
01:13:24,467 --> 01:13:27,635
we see the siege wall
running along here.

1229
01:13:27,637 --> 01:13:31,272
<i>There's perhaps</i>
<i>8,000 Romans down below.</i>

1230
01:13:32,575 --> 01:13:34,375
<i>There's 960 refugees up here.</i>

1231
01:13:34,377 --> 01:13:38,079
<i>They've been up here</i>
<i>since the year 66 AD.</i>

1232
01:13:38,415 --> 01:13:40,715
<i>And what do these people do? They
are faced with this dilemma.</i>

1233
01:13:40,717 --> 01:13:43,751
<i>Are we gonna become slaves</i>
<i>the rest of our lives?</i>

1234
01:13:43,753 --> 01:13:47,855
Or are we gonna commit suicide
and die as free men?

1235
01:13:47,991 --> 01:13:51,225
<i>In Judaism, it's forbidden</i>
<i>to commit suicide,</i>

1236
01:13:51,227 --> 01:13:52,894
<i>so each man took his family,</i>

1237
01:13:52,896 --> 01:13:55,930
<i>and the father</i>
<i>gathered all the goods.</i>

1238
01:13:55,932 --> 01:13:58,533
<i>He killed his wife.</i>
<i>He killed his children</i>

1239
01:13:58,535 --> 01:14:01,235
<i>and somebody then killed him.</i>

1240
01:14:03,306 --> 01:14:06,707
<i>In the beginning, this probably
was a story of heroism.</i>

1241
01:14:06,709 --> 01:14:08,009
<i>But what a lot of people</i>
<i>don't realize,</i>

1242
01:14:08,011 --> 01:14:11,179
<i>the people who came up here were a bunch
of political, religious fanatics.</i>

1243
01:14:11,181 --> 01:14:13,881
<i>When they weren't fighting against
the Romans, what were they doing?</i>

1244
01:14:13,883 --> 01:14:15,817
They were fighting against
their fellow Jews.

1245
01:14:15,819 --> 01:14:17,618
Not far from here
is a place called En Gedi.

1246
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:20,254
People from En Gedi wouldn't
participate in the revolt.

1247
01:14:20,256 --> 01:14:24,192
What did they do? They went in and
they killed 700 of their fellow Jews.

1248
01:14:24,194 --> 01:14:26,360
Most people don't know
that part of the story.

1249
01:14:26,362 --> 01:14:28,763
<i>But if you look at the whole
thing, the whole picture,</i>

1250
01:14:28,765 --> 01:14:31,032
<i>we're looking at, I think,</i>
<i>religious fanaticism.</i>

1251
01:14:31,034 --> 01:14:32,166
<i>I think one could draw</i>
<i>a strong parallel</i>

1252
01:14:32,168 --> 01:14:38,272
<i>between what was happening 2000 years
ago and what is happening today.</i>

1253
01:14:50,220 --> 01:14:55,223
<i>No one in</i> The Da Vinci Code
<i>ever sets foot in Jerusalem.</i>

1254
01:14:55,225 --> 01:15:00,261
<i>But without this city,</i>
<i>there would be no Crusades.</i>

1255
01:15:00,263 --> 01:15:02,163
<i>No Holy Grail,</i>

1256
01:15:02,165 --> 01:15:05,733
<i>no Abraham</i>
<i>offering to sacrifice his son.</i>

1257
01:15:05,735 --> 01:15:09,504
<i>No Prophet Muhammad</i>
<i>ascending to heaven.</i>

1258
01:15:09,506 --> 01:15:12,974
<i>No place for the Messiah</i>
<i>to return.</i>

1259
01:15:17,046 --> 01:15:19,547
What makes Jerusalem holy?

1260
01:15:19,549 --> 01:15:22,483
The actual temple
that was built there?

1261
01:15:22,485 --> 01:15:25,486
Or it was holy
before the temple

1262
01:15:25,488 --> 01:15:29,257
and that's why the temple
was built there.

1263
01:15:29,959 --> 01:15:32,894
<i>I have prayed at</i>
<i>the wall hundreds of times.</i>

1264
01:15:32,896 --> 01:15:34,629
<i>And there are times</i>
<i>I stand at that wall</i>

1265
01:15:34,631 --> 01:15:37,198
and I say, "This is just
a bunch of rocks."

1266
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:38,232
And the fact is,

1267
01:15:38,234 --> 01:15:41,469
any wall
I can impose meaning on.

1268
01:15:41,471 --> 01:15:42,904
A wall is just a way of saying

1269
01:15:42,906 --> 01:15:45,072
that there's
a kind of stability here

1270
01:15:45,074 --> 01:15:48,576
<i>where I'm gonna rest myself on,
I'm gonna lean on this wall.</i>

1271
01:15:48,578 --> 01:15:52,380
But, if I use difference
to exclude other people,

1272
01:15:52,382 --> 01:15:56,083
if I use difference
to make myself superior,

1273
01:15:56,085 --> 01:15:59,687
then I've turned that wall
not into a meeting place,

1274
01:15:59,689 --> 01:16:02,390
<i>but that wall</i>
<i>into a separation place.</i>

1275
01:16:02,392 --> 01:16:06,327
<i>No other place brings more
faiths closer together</i>

1276
01:16:06,329 --> 01:16:09,730
<i>and keeps more people</i>
<i>further apart.</i>

1277
01:16:09,732 --> 01:16:13,901
The Temple Mount, I mean, if any...
if anywhere symbolizes for me

1278
01:16:13,903 --> 01:16:20,708
the madness and the sadness of literalist
religion, it's got to be there.

1279
01:16:20,710 --> 01:16:24,946
We have started to divide,
to spread...

1280
01:16:24,948 --> 01:16:29,016
...you are an American,
I'm an Israeli, you're a Jew,

1281
01:16:29,018 --> 01:16:33,087
he's a Christian,
he's a Muslim,

1282
01:16:33,456 --> 01:16:36,591
Everything is divided.
What does it matter?

1283
01:16:36,593 --> 01:16:43,598
Now, all the fundamentalism, all over the
world, Jews, Muslims and Christians...

1284
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:48,936
...the thing that drives them
it's not love, it's hatred.

1285
01:16:48,938 --> 01:16:54,208
All of us yearn to be on journeys
in which we will arrive.

1286
01:16:54,210 --> 01:16:58,245
No one wants to be on a journey
in which they never arrive.

1287
01:16:58,247 --> 01:17:01,449
Apocalyptic stories
are arrival stories.

1288
01:17:01,451 --> 01:17:07,855
And they make sense of the destruction
and messiness in all of our journeys.

1289
01:17:07,857 --> 01:17:10,458
But we have to be very careful,

1290
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:14,962
apocalyptic stories
can become predictive

1291
01:17:14,964 --> 01:17:20,368
and then, what people do is, they
build policy on creating destruction

1292
01:17:20,370 --> 01:17:23,504
so they can escape
the pain of this world

1293
01:17:23,506 --> 01:17:25,906
into some ultimate
final solution.

1294
01:17:25,908 --> 01:17:28,809
And me,
I'm not into final solutions.

1295
01:17:28,811 --> 01:17:31,212
If we carry on
taking the myths literally,

1296
01:17:31,214 --> 01:17:34,315
then the myths
of the... of the end of days,

1297
01:17:34,317 --> 01:17:37,652
Armageddon and all the stuff
you get in Revelations

1298
01:17:37,654 --> 01:17:40,121
is gonna turn into
a self-fulfilling prophecy.

1299
01:17:40,123 --> 01:17:41,989
Once you've got people
who believe

1300
01:17:41,991 --> 01:17:44,959
that not only is this stuff
to be taken seriously,

1301
01:17:44,961 --> 01:17:48,729
but it would be a good thing
if it happened,

1302
01:17:48,731 --> 01:17:52,933
and you've got those people with
their finger on the nuclear trigger,

1303
01:17:52,935 --> 01:17:53,768
which we now have,

1304
01:17:53,770 --> 01:17:56,537
you know, it's a real danger
that we could... we could

1305
01:17:56,539 --> 01:18:01,175
kind of go into some sort of
self-fulfilling prophecy.

1306
01:18:01,177 --> 01:18:03,644
<i>Has the final</i>
<i>chapter been written?</i>

1307
01:18:03,646 --> 01:18:05,913
<i>The Da Vinci Code</i> doesn't say.

1308
01:18:05,915 --> 01:18:09,450
<i>It pursues the stories</i>
<i>that begin the Bible.</i>

1309
01:18:09,452 --> 01:18:11,652
<i>We are drawn</i>
<i>to the one that ends it.</i>

1310
01:18:11,654 --> 01:18:15,856
<i>To the Book of Revelation,</i>
<i>to Armageddon.</i>

1311
01:18:26,069 --> 01:18:27,902
Now, can you imagine
this vastness?

1312
01:18:27,904 --> 01:18:30,738
Millions and millions
of soldiers in it?

1313
01:18:30,740 --> 01:18:32,707
Fighting, battling?

1314
01:18:32,709 --> 01:18:34,742
<i>If the Bible</i>
<i>is the literal truth,</i>

1315
01:18:34,744 --> 01:18:41,148
<i>then this is where the countdown
to the end of time begins.</i>

1316
01:18:42,018 --> 01:18:46,353
It actually talks about the blood
being slain here will be so much

1317
01:18:46,355 --> 01:18:51,225
that the horses... It'll be up
to the horses', uh, breast.

1318
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:55,663
<i>The Word says what we war
against is the demonic forces.</i>

1319
01:18:55,665 --> 01:18:57,198
<i>But I still can't help</i>
<i>but think</i>

1320
01:18:57,200 --> 01:19:01,035
<i>at some time in the future,</i>
<i>there will be a battle here.</i>

1321
01:19:01,037 --> 01:19:04,038
I don't fear Armageddon
as far as happening,

1322
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:08,542
or I don't fear of dying in it
if... if I would be here,

1323
01:19:08,544 --> 01:19:13,047
I fear for the very people and the
souls that are lost within it.

1324
01:19:13,049 --> 01:19:15,349
The joy and the happiness
that we have,

1325
01:19:15,351 --> 01:19:19,553
is knowing that the promises
in the Bible are true.

1326
01:19:19,555 --> 01:19:23,057
And that this battle
that, uh, we're talking about,

1327
01:19:23,059 --> 01:19:25,459
that there's only going to be
one winner out of this,

1328
01:19:25,461 --> 01:19:28,295
and that will be, uh,
the Lord Jesus Christ.

1329
01:19:28,297 --> 01:19:30,931
So I try to focus on more
of the end of it.

1330
01:19:30,933 --> 01:19:33,567
The glorious kingdom is coming.

1331
01:19:33,569 --> 01:19:36,604
"And let him who thirst come,
whoever desires,

1332
01:19:36,606 --> 01:19:38,372
"let him take
the water of life freely.

1333
01:19:38,374 --> 01:19:43,878
"For I testify to everyone who hears the
words of the prophecy of this book,

1334
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:45,279
<i>"if anyone</i>
<i>adds to these things,</i>

1335
01:19:45,281 --> 01:19:48,382
<i>"God will add to him the plagues
that are written in this book.</i>

1336
01:19:48,384 --> 01:19:52,753
<i>"And if anyone takes away from the
words of the book of this prophecy,</i>

1337
01:19:52,755 --> 01:19:55,656
<i>"God shall take away his part</i>
<i>from the book of life.</i>

1338
01:19:55,658 --> 01:20:01,996
"He who testifies to these things
says, 'Surely I am coming quickly.'."

1339
01:20:01,998 --> 01:20:04,565
No wonder the book ends by
saying, "Come, Lord Jesus."

1340
01:20:04,567 --> 01:20:09,403
You know, let's get to this heavenly
matrimony as quickly as possible,

1341
01:20:09,405 --> 01:20:11,071
'cause there are many good
things in this world,

1342
01:20:11,073 --> 01:20:13,474
but it's still not
going to satisfy

1343
01:20:13,476 --> 01:20:15,176
the hungers of
our human heart completely.

1344
01:20:15,178 --> 01:20:19,647
Revelations, um, doesn't read
significantly different

1345
01:20:19,649 --> 01:20:22,783
from, um, testimonials
of people on acid trips

1346
01:20:22,785 --> 01:20:27,421
or people who drop mescaline or
psilocybin for the first time

1347
01:20:27,423 --> 01:20:28,255
or schizophrenics.

1348
01:20:28,257 --> 01:20:30,791
No wonder it's popular.
It's... It's like <i> Harry Potter,</i>

1349
01:20:30,793 --> 01:20:33,594
or like, uh, Tolkien's
<i>The Lord of the Rings.</i>

1350
01:20:33,596 --> 01:20:37,998
People love those stories about
cosmic battles between good and evil.

1351
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,936
And that's a cosmic battle between
good and evil. A real one.

1352
01:20:41,938 --> 01:20:46,307
At some time in the future
there will be a battle here.

1353
01:20:46,309 --> 01:20:49,376
And it will be literal.

1354
01:20:49,378 --> 01:20:51,545
This is not to be taken
literally.

1355
01:20:51,547 --> 01:20:53,347
This is spiritual allegory,

1356
01:20:53,349 --> 01:20:54,949
and it can unite us
instead of dividing us,

1357
01:20:54,951 --> 01:20:56,784
because there is no us and them.
There's just us.

1358
01:20:56,786 --> 01:21:01,255
There really in reality, there
is no Jews, Muslims, Christians.

1359
01:21:01,257 --> 01:21:03,224
There's just us.

1360
01:21:06,329 --> 01:21:07,461
<i>The end of the journey</i>

1361
01:21:07,463 --> 01:21:10,231
<i>for Robert Langdon</i>
<i>and Sophie Neveu</i>

1362
01:21:10,233 --> 01:21:12,233
<i>is Rosslyn Chapel.</i>

1363
01:21:12,235 --> 01:21:15,202
<i>They came</i>
<i>looking for their Grail.</i>

1364
01:21:15,204 --> 01:21:18,172
<i>We come looking for ours.</i>

1365
01:21:20,176 --> 01:21:21,809
<i>Our congregation</i>
<i>here in Rosslyn,</i>

1366
01:21:21,811 --> 01:21:26,413
<i>welcomes people from Christian
faiths, other faiths</i>

1367
01:21:26,415 --> 01:21:29,617
<i>and those of no faith at all.</i>

1368
01:21:30,052 --> 01:21:35,489
<i>Rosslyn, if you break out
from Celtic into English,</i>

1369
01:21:35,491 --> 01:21:37,925
<i>it means</i>
<i>a place of hidden knowledge.</i>

1370
01:21:37,927 --> 01:21:42,029
<i>It's been said, that the cubes
in the chapel's ceiling,</i>

1371
01:21:42,031 --> 01:21:45,399
<i>are a code that leads</i>
<i>to the Holy Grail.</i>

1372
01:21:45,401 --> 01:21:47,234
Well, the thing
that brought me here,

1373
01:21:47,236 --> 01:21:51,739
was the musical mystery
at this end of the chapel.

1374
01:21:52,575 --> 01:21:55,776
<i>The reason we have</i>
<i>a musical connotation to it</i>

1375
01:21:55,778 --> 01:21:58,746
<i>is because</i>
<i>at the beginning of each arch</i>

1376
01:21:58,748 --> 01:22:01,181
<i>is an angel</i>
<i>playing an instrument</i>

1377
01:22:01,183 --> 01:22:06,387
<i>and there's 13 of these angels all
playing different instruments.</i>

1378
01:22:06,389 --> 01:22:08,689
They are quite
distinct symbols.

1379
01:22:08,691 --> 01:22:12,259
<i>We found them in... in</i>
<i>one science called Cymatics.</i>

1380
01:22:12,261 --> 01:22:13,961
<i>The vibrations</i>
<i>of a single note,</i>

1381
01:22:13,963 --> 01:22:19,266
<i>um, form a pattern into a symbol
on a sheet plate glass with sand.</i>

1382
01:22:19,268 --> 01:22:24,638
There's a figure eight right
underneath the bottom cube there.

1383
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:27,007
<i>Above us, the sign of infinity.</i>

1384
01:22:27,009 --> 01:22:32,913
<i>Below, a grave in which</i>
<i>two souls await eternity.</i>

1385
01:22:33,115 --> 01:22:35,716
<i>This building</i>
<i>was inspired by a woman.</i>

1386
01:22:35,718 --> 01:22:39,253
<i>Um, William Sinclair paid
for the chapel to be built.</i>

1387
01:22:39,255 --> 01:22:43,490
<i>Elizabeth Douglas was very much
the love of William's life.</i>

1388
01:22:43,492 --> 01:22:46,860
<i>She was actually</i>
<i>the inspiration behind it.</i>

1389
01:22:46,862 --> 01:22:48,696
<i>And this place was her dream.</i>

1390
01:22:48,698 --> 01:22:51,999
<i>As the work</i>
<i>had begun on the chapel,</i>

1391
01:22:52,001 --> 01:22:53,033
just as
the foundations were laid,

1392
01:22:53,035 --> 01:22:57,137
and the first beginnings of
the walls were taking shape,

1393
01:22:57,139 --> 01:22:58,072
she died.

1394
01:22:58,074 --> 01:22:59,673
And she was buried
down in the crypt.

1395
01:22:59,675 --> 01:23:02,009
And they believed
that on the Day of Judgment,

1396
01:23:02,011 --> 01:23:09,783
these black slabs would open and
they would be taken to paradise.

1397
01:23:09,785 --> 01:23:13,520
<i>I don't think Rosslyn Chapel</i>
<i>would be as elaborate</i>

1398
01:23:13,522 --> 01:23:16,790
<i>and have had so much care</i>
<i>and love put into it</i>

1399
01:23:16,792 --> 01:23:18,692
<i>if it wasn't for the fact</i>
<i>that this was the place</i>

1400
01:23:18,694 --> 01:23:23,263
<i>that William was gonna spend
eternity with his wife.</i>

1401
01:23:23,366 --> 01:23:26,333
<i>Stuart Mitchell</i>
<i>unlocked the code,</i>

1402
01:23:26,335 --> 01:23:28,836
<i>and the building sang to him.</i>

1403
01:23:43,619 --> 01:23:47,121
I can't give an answer to when
our Lord is going to return.

1404
01:23:47,123 --> 01:23:50,591
Um, it doesn't matter a rap,

1405
01:23:50,893 --> 01:23:53,427
in... in... in a sense,

1406
01:23:53,429 --> 01:23:59,233
because the return
has already begun and, uh...

1407
01:23:59,235 --> 01:24:02,636
I can't get to heaven
quick enough.

1408
01:24:03,105 --> 01:24:03,904
<i>We have no way of knowing</i>

1409
01:24:03,906 --> 01:24:07,741
<i>and that is why there are so many
stories in the New Testament</i>

1410
01:24:07,743 --> 01:24:09,710
<i>in which</i>
<i>Jesus always reminds us</i>

1411
01:24:09,712 --> 01:24:12,312
that we never know the day,
we never know the hour,

1412
01:24:12,314 --> 01:24:14,681
and so we must always be alert.

1413
01:24:14,683 --> 01:24:16,050
Love stands for eternity.

1414
01:24:16,052 --> 01:24:19,686
We... I don't love people to
have my heart broken at the end.

1415
01:24:19,688 --> 01:24:21,722
I wanna be with them
and, of course, with Jesus,

1416
01:24:21,724 --> 01:24:23,724
the one I try to love
as much as possible.

1417
01:24:23,726 --> 01:24:27,895
And that, uh, that love
says you will not die.

1418
01:24:27,897 --> 01:24:33,100
Love, uh, uh, love is... is
a protest of eternity,

1419
01:24:33,102 --> 01:24:34,868
that our love is forever.

1420
01:24:34,870 --> 01:24:36,003
I'll be loving you always.

1421
01:24:36,005 --> 01:24:40,641
The powerful part of a,
uh, apocalyptic story,

1422
01:24:40,643 --> 01:24:44,411
is that, it helps make sense
of what's going on

1423
01:24:44,413 --> 01:24:45,612
and in a sense,
it's incredibly hopeful.

1424
01:24:45,614 --> 01:24:48,148
It says, "Look, look, of course
we're going through destruction,

1425
01:24:48,150 --> 01:24:52,252
"but on the other side of the
Apocalypse is incredible renewal."

1426
01:24:52,254 --> 01:24:55,856
God intended us
to eat of the apple

1427
01:24:55,858 --> 01:24:58,659
of the knowledge
of good and evil.

1428
01:24:58,661 --> 01:25:03,163
The... The seed
that was in that fruit,

1429
01:25:03,165 --> 01:25:06,100
it was not ripe at the time
that they ate it,

1430
01:25:06,102 --> 01:25:08,102
but the... the seed
is ripening in us.

1431
01:25:08,104 --> 01:25:11,805
<i>That we will find</i>
<i>the ways of knowledge.</i>

1432
01:25:13,676 --> 01:25:18,378
<i>We are the stories</i>
<i>our ancestors told.</i>

1433
01:25:18,481 --> 01:25:19,546
<i>And the stories we tell today</i>

1434
01:25:19,548 --> 01:25:24,084
<i>create the world</i>
<i>our children will inherit.</i>

1435
01:25:24,286 --> 01:25:29,323
<i>Live out one story</i>
<i>and create this.</i>

1436
01:25:29,992 --> 01:25:31,625
<i>Or this.</i>

1437
01:25:32,394 --> 01:25:33,694
<i>Live out another</i>

1438
01:25:33,696 --> 01:25:36,163
<i>and end up like this.</i>

1439
01:25:37,566 --> 01:25:39,333
<i>Or this.</i>

1440
01:25:40,136 --> 01:25:42,302
<i>Whichever choice we make,</i>

1441
01:25:42,304 --> 01:25:45,305
<i>we are always part of this.</i>

1442
01:25:45,875 --> 01:25:48,842
<i>Six billion people.</i>

1443
01:25:49,311 --> 01:25:51,879
<i>Six billion stories.</i>

1444
01:25:51,881 --> 01:25:55,749
<i>No single truth</i>
<i>large enough for everyone.</i>

1445
01:25:55,751 --> 01:26:02,523
<i>For the truth, like the
universe, is expanding.</i>

1446
01:28:37,413 --> 01:28:42,249
<i>¶ Rose,</i>
<i>time of our lives no one knows</i>

1447
01:28:42,251 --> 01:28:45,819
<i>¶ People and places we chose</i>

1448
01:28:48,691 --> 01:28:51,958
<i>¶ For you, the stories</i>
<i>and times that we've told,</i>

1449
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:55,362
<i>¶ The truth,</i>
<i>that there's nothing more</i>

1450
01:28:55,364 --> 01:28:58,865
