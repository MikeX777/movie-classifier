1
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:30,634
Shave him bald.

2
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,928
You're lucky to get a free haircut.

3
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:55,068
Whose are you, little one? Eh?

4
00:01:58,055 --> 00:02:06,936
A Strip of Uncut Wild Flowers

5
00:02:14,026 --> 00:02:15,100
Who is your father?

6
00:02:15,812 --> 00:02:20,428
Nobody. I was brought
by the wind, ownerless.

18
00:04:12,673 --> 00:04:15,067
- Good afternoon.  - Good afternoon.
- Well, I brought him.

19
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,827
Stop it!

20
00:04:26,517 --> 00:04:29,206
Hello, sir.

21
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:45,488
Here is your linen. Wash up,
disinfect yourself.

22
00:05:22,994 --> 00:05:25,420
And for what do you
need the body scrub?

23
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,366
I'm looking for someone
to rub my back.

24
00:05:27,866 --> 00:05:29,909
Well, I can do it.

25
00:05:31,689 --> 00:05:33,567
I'll run from you too.

26
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,658
We'll catch you.

27
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:03,725
I'll run anyhow.
Even if you chain me.

28
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:08,495
Take your hands out of your pockets
or we'll sew them up. Stand straight.

29
00:06:09,183 --> 00:06:11,840
Look me in the eyes
when I speak to you.

30
00:06:12,092 --> 00:06:16,871
You've shaved me, but who cares?
You're forbidden to hit me.

31
00:06:29,855 --> 00:06:31,909
Look, how much things you got,

32
00:06:32,409 --> 00:06:36,060
And you're surprised you were
sent here from the special school.

33
00:06:36,061 --> 00:06:39,115
Probably you got on
everyone's nerves.

34
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:48,522
You're a bad element, young man.

35
00:06:53,552 --> 00:06:56,306
Do you love your Mum?

36
00:06:57,477 --> 00:07:02,987
Don't know. Probably not?

37
00:07:12,092 --> 00:07:16,073
I'm aiming straight for your eyes.

38
00:07:27,724 --> 00:07:33,069
What is that? Take it out.

39
00:07:35,428 --> 00:07:39,021
Which eye: the left one
or the right one?

40
00:07:43,191 --> 00:07:46,264
Will it make you feel better?

41
00:07:46,264 --> 00:07:47,837
Will you be happy?

42
00:07:48,105 --> 00:07:52,356
Just because I'm here,
I can't play jokes?

43
00:08:32,067 --> 00:08:34,767
You should stand up
if an elder comes in.

44
00:08:37,938 --> 00:08:41,610
I'm the head of the reformatory.
Trituzny Anton Gerasimovich.

45
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:45,148
Yeah, I know,
run there, run here.

46
00:08:47,249 --> 00:08:52,596
It's good that you
believe in immortality.

47
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:55,895
Take a brush, some paint.

48
00:08:55,895 --> 00:08:57,601
Paint over it, for
you and for others.

49
00:08:57,601 --> 00:08:59,556
We're into do-it-yourself.

50
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:00,917
The nail.

51
00:09:00,917 --> 00:09:02,727
What nail?

52
00:09:02,727 --> 00:09:05,336
The one you used to
scratch the wall.

53
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,950
Oh, you're even afraid of a nail.

54
00:09:23,465 --> 00:09:25,643
We had a boy,
before you.

55
00:09:25,643 --> 00:09:27,852
He swallowed a nail.

56
00:09:27,861 --> 00:09:29,399
He wanted freedom that badly.

57
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:31,526
One can swallow the devil here.

58
00:09:31,526 --> 00:09:33,263
We are in charge.

59
00:09:33,263 --> 00:09:36,591
We don't hide our rules.

60
00:09:44,218 --> 00:09:47,254
Do you think you've
tamed me? Do you?

61
00:09:47,358 --> 00:09:50,643
There's a certain man out there
in the world: Uncle Ivan.

62
00:09:50,643 --> 00:09:52,785
You should know...

63
00:09:53,285 --> 00:09:57,806
...the moment word of my
treatment reaches the navy...

64
00:09:57,806 --> 00:10:03,719
...there will be a 180-degree
turnaround. You'll see.

65
00:10:05,755 --> 00:10:09,052
Porfiry, hold on!

66
00:10:09,052 --> 00:10:13,317
Where did you hide him?
Have you really locked him up?

67
00:10:13,317 --> 00:10:16,991
I'll bail the boy out.

68
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,080
Here is your receipt.

69
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:23,287
You don't know him.
He's like fire.

70
00:10:23,287 --> 00:10:26,137
Such a helper will
come in handy.

71
00:10:26,137 --> 00:10:31,556
Such a life is for him:
one of courage and risk.

72
00:10:31,556 --> 00:10:34,446
Hold on, Porfiry, hold on.

73
00:10:34,446 --> 00:10:38,564
I'll be there in a moment.
I must deal with some poachers.

74
00:10:38,713 --> 00:10:42,153
It's a pity you're not here.

75
00:10:42,653 --> 00:10:44,189
When I grow up...

76
00:10:44,189 --> 00:10:46,776
...I'll become a defender
of birds and fish.

77
00:10:46,776 --> 00:10:51,961
And for fishmongers like you,
there will be no mercy.

78
00:11:15,554 --> 00:11:18,596
Kulbaka, stop it.

79
00:12:00,683 --> 00:12:01,897
Hello, kids!

80
00:12:01,897 --> 00:12:02,963
Don't get up.

81
00:12:03,463 --> 00:12:07,450
Here you are, our juvenile
detention class. Newcomers.

82
00:12:07,515 --> 00:12:09,442
Children, show me your hands.

83
00:12:09,442 --> 00:12:13,424
Now she'll find out who
gets their pockets mixed up.

84
00:12:13,425 --> 00:12:17,060
Between what belongs to them
and what belongs to someone else.

85
00:12:18,182 --> 00:12:21,155
And what do you have here?
Did you mark yourself?

86
00:12:21,655 --> 00:12:23,393
He was born with it.
He's a bad element.

87
00:12:23,393 --> 00:12:25,098
You're a real comedian.

88
00:12:25,098 --> 00:12:27,090
What got you sent here?
Where are you from?

89
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:29,639
I'm from Kamyshanky.
It's on the Kazakh side.

90
00:12:29,912 --> 00:12:31,961
Why are you here?

91
00:12:31,961 --> 00:12:34,218
I ran away from home,
dropped out of school.

92
00:12:34,218 --> 00:12:37,735
I slept in boats, in attics.

93
00:12:37,822 --> 00:12:39,681
And what else?

94
00:12:39,681 --> 00:12:41,151
Why did you fall silent?

95
00:12:41,151 --> 00:12:43,457
Tell her how you hooked a fish.

96
00:12:43,457 --> 00:12:46,414
He's our juvenile poacher.
It's a type of cadres we have.

97
00:12:46,514 --> 00:12:47,588
Who hooked what?

98
00:12:47,988 --> 00:12:49,010
When did I hook anything?

99
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:50,605
It's a lie.
Who accuses me?

100
00:12:50,705 --> 00:12:52,854
What does he mean, "hooked"?

101
00:12:52,854 --> 00:12:55,523
It's when the fish is grabbed
through the ribs with a hook.

102
00:12:55,523 --> 00:12:56,921
It's a barbaric method.

103
00:12:56,921 --> 00:12:58,495
But no one will confess...

104
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,295
...though we can see
the truth in his eyes.

105
00:13:00,295 --> 00:13:02,499
So he's a juvenile poacher?
- Yes.

106
00:13:02,508 --> 00:13:05,862
How could you hook a living
creature through the ribs?

107
00:13:05,862 --> 00:13:07,914
Don't you think it's painful
for the little fish?

108
00:13:07,914 --> 00:13:12,914
Don't you think your lies
are painful for me?

109
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:17,079
And if he really didn't hook
it and isn't a poacher?

110
00:13:17,179 --> 00:13:20,195
How can you cast
suspicion on him?

111
00:13:21,516 --> 00:13:23,665
As for you, ma'am,
don't protect me.

112
00:13:23,665 --> 00:13:24,735
Maybe I did hook it.

113
00:13:24,735 --> 00:13:27,798
Maybe I've robbed
people's nets.

114
00:13:28,565 --> 00:13:31,839
What happened?
Go on, defend him.

115
00:13:32,468 --> 00:13:35,028
Was he arrested at the port?
He was.

116
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:39,104
And did he sneak off to
the beach this summer? He did.

117
00:13:39,557 --> 00:13:41,167
And did he steal from
unsuspecting fools?

118
00:13:41,267 --> 00:13:43,903
This is also a lie. Unless
you saw it, don't say it.

119
00:13:44,348 --> 00:13:46,892
It's a lie. It never happened.

120
00:13:46,987 --> 00:13:50,814
Never mind. Calm down.
We believe you.

121
00:13:54,528 --> 00:13:56,590
Listen: there's no
smoke without fire.

122
00:13:56,657 --> 00:13:58,996
You're a real saint.

123
00:13:59,024 --> 00:14:00,957
Maybe you're descended from
a tsar of Kiev Rus, or...

124
00:14:00,957 --> 00:14:02,319
Why are you suddenly
my character witness?

125
00:14:02,319 --> 00:14:03,744
...from their roots...

126
00:14:03,744 --> 00:14:05,448
Yeah, an heir, a scion...

127
00:14:05,448 --> 00:14:08,165
...or maybe just son
of a single mother.

128
00:14:08,165 --> 00:14:10,875
So maybe you, the
adults, can explain:

129
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,194
What is a son of
a single mother?

130
00:14:12,194 --> 00:14:14,503
When I have never seen my
father with my own eyes.

131
00:14:14,503 --> 00:14:18,375
What do you think, I was
born from the Holy Spirit?

132
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:22,865
Maybe the stork brought me?
Or I grew in a cabbage patch?

133
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:28,554
I've been branded with a hot
iron: "Fatherless Oksanych."

134
00:14:28,554 --> 00:14:30,954
And now I have to live with it
everywhere in your wide world.

135
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:33,532
As you can see, he is
like a boiling kettle.

136
00:14:33,532 --> 00:14:34,684
Such a boy won't perish.

137
00:14:34,684 --> 00:14:37,262
He could catch a
wolf by its ears.

138
00:14:37,694 --> 00:14:39,672
You should apologize to him.

139
00:14:39,672 --> 00:14:41,768
Why?

140
00:14:41,768 --> 00:14:44,168
You know very well.

141
00:14:44,168 --> 00:14:45,474
My dear friends...

142
00:14:45,474 --> 00:14:48,120
At first you won't
be used to this.

143
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,609
You may find it boring.

144
00:14:49,609 --> 00:14:53,674
But when your term is over,
you'll feel rather different.

145
00:14:53,674 --> 00:14:56,328
My dears, just promise me...

146
00:14:56,328 --> 00:15:00,328
...you'll be disciplined,
and don't forget hygiene.

147
00:15:00,475 --> 00:15:02,022
Marysa Pavlovna, go
on with the lesson.

148
00:15:02,132 --> 00:15:03,931
I shall invite the committee
back for another class.

149
00:15:04,022 --> 00:15:06,769
Anatoliy Ivanovich, after you.

150
00:15:12,769 --> 00:15:18,754
As for you, Anton Gerasimovich,
please come see me after school.

151
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:27,413
Can you tell me, please,
where does Oksana Kulba work?

152
00:15:27,413 --> 00:15:30,407
There she is.

153
00:15:41,713 --> 00:15:43,487
Good afternoon!

154
00:15:55,306 --> 00:15:58,089
I'm your son's teacher.

155
00:16:00,599 --> 00:16:04,816
He would not obey me
even when I'd use a belt.

156
00:16:04,816 --> 00:16:11,402
How do you expect him to obey
when you look like a schoolgirl?

157
00:16:11,402 --> 00:16:19,540
Though nowadays, even
schoolgirls become mothers.

158
00:16:55,203 --> 00:16:58,223
Your son ran away.

159
00:16:58,523 --> 00:17:01,944
He's at your house right now.

160
00:17:01,944 --> 00:17:06,089
I think it would be better if you
brought him to the special school.

161
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:10,483
Rather than the superintendent,
who's sitting in the bus.

162
00:17:24,012 --> 00:17:25,408
Think about it.

163
00:17:50,648 --> 00:17:52,669
- Porfiry, my dear!
- Mother!

164
00:17:53,671 --> 00:17:55,760
My dearest son!

165
00:17:58,662 --> 00:18:04,398
My darling! My sun! Honey!
My sweet! You're back!

166
00:18:05,101 --> 00:18:07,631
- Have they released you?
- I've released myself.

167
00:18:07,846 --> 00:18:09,581
Have you run away
without permission?

168
00:18:09,781 --> 00:18:11,679
And there was such a chase!

169
00:18:11,779 --> 00:18:17,158
I jumped to the window, from
the window to the ledge...

170
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:21,307
...from the ledge to the roof,
from the roof to the tree...

171
00:18:21,307 --> 00:18:24,781
...from the tree
to the fence...

172
00:18:25,481 --> 00:18:30,563
...and up there was a guard
with a rifle, with dogs...

173
00:18:30,863 --> 00:18:33,537
...and with spotlights.
And I jumped on him.

174
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:38,421
You're my little dreamer.

175
00:18:39,121 --> 00:18:42,338
What guards are you
talking about? What dogs?

176
00:18:42,338 --> 00:18:44,872
Oh, you're so skinny!

177
00:18:44,972 --> 00:18:47,244
This dog would have torn
anyone else apart.

178
00:18:47,244 --> 00:18:51,322
But it didn't even bark at
me. It only licked my cheek.

179
00:18:52,122 --> 00:18:55,507
You see, mom, all dogs love me.

180
00:18:55,507 --> 00:18:58,441
Yes, they do, my dearest.

181
00:18:58,941 --> 00:19:02,788
Mother, ma'am, just
don't give me back.

182
00:19:03,178 --> 00:19:07,713
My son, you've made your bed.
Now sleep in it. It's fair.

183
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:09,416
I'll quickly run off to work.

184
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:11,379
I'll ask to be let
off for the day...

185
00:19:11,379 --> 00:19:14,819
...and then we'll
go there together.

186
00:19:19,494 --> 00:19:21,131
- Mother!
- What?

187
00:19:21,699 --> 00:19:24,801
Ma'am, can I ask you something?

188
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:29,632
Mother, who is my father?

189
00:19:40,464 --> 00:19:43,417
My dear son.

190
00:19:43,417 --> 00:19:46,290
You have never
asked me about him.

191
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:49,763
Please never ask again.

192
00:19:49,763 --> 00:19:53,796
Your father is a good person.

193
00:19:53,796 --> 00:19:57,109
He never hurt me.

194
00:19:57,109 --> 00:20:02,493
You were born from the
truth, not from a lie.

195
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:06,854
From the truth, my son.
Not from a lie.

196
00:20:24,142 --> 00:20:28,552
Wait for me here.
I'll be back soon.

197
00:20:28,998 --> 00:20:33,000
Ships, break off the anchors...

198
00:20:34,002 --> 00:20:41,102
Fly through the world,
this oasis of silence.

199
00:20:41,802 --> 00:20:51,000
And I'll spread my wings...

200
00:20:51,102 --> 00:21:03,000
And only my shadow 
will glide over you...

201
00:21:14,402 --> 00:21:25,300
I'm free on my land, like a wind.

202
00:21:26,902 --> 00:21:39,400
Like waves, like a bird
with celestial reach...

203
00:21:40,102 --> 00:21:52,000
And only my shadow 
will glide over you...

204
00:21:53,102 --> 00:22:02,000
You won't catch me!
You won't catch me!

205
00:22:02,102 --> 00:22:08,000
You won't catch me!

206
00:22:44,102 --> 00:22:51,000
You won't catch me!
You won't catch me!

207
00:22:51,751 --> 00:22:57,097
You won't catch me!

208
00:23:15,711 --> 00:23:22,167
Catch me, I'll run anyway...

209
00:23:22,727 --> 00:23:29,139
...to embrace the sun and rain.

210
00:23:30,002 --> 00:23:38,000
Like a leaf, I'll blow
 away among the stars.

211
00:23:38,235 --> 00:23:48,667
And only my shadow 
will glide over you...

212
00:23:49,983 --> 00:23:57,817
You won't catch me!
You won't catch me!

213
00:23:58,734 --> 00:24:04,389
You won't catch me.

214
00:24:24,774 --> 00:24:26,962
The way is clear.

215
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,524
Porfiry, my dear, eat the cake.

216
00:24:41,524 --> 00:24:42,789
I've baked it myself.

217
00:24:42,789 --> 00:24:44,950
Drink the tea, my dear.

218
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:48,971
Sonny! Porfiry.

219
00:24:49,171 --> 00:24:53,570
When you were little,
you loved me very much.

220
00:24:55,017 --> 00:25:00,521
Here are your papers,
Porfiry. You're free.

221
00:25:01,321 --> 00:25:04,228
Happy sailing!

222
00:25:24,094 --> 00:25:25,694
Lay aft.

223
00:25:25,694 --> 00:25:27,961
Raise the anchor.

224
00:25:36,863 --> 00:25:41,540
Some here have asked me,
"Do you love your mum?"

225
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:45,557
I don't answer silly questions.

226
00:25:45,648 --> 00:25:46,521
Period.

227
00:25:46,521 --> 00:25:47,586
I do love her.

228
00:25:47,586 --> 00:25:48,652
Period.

229
00:25:48,652 --> 00:25:50,965
But it's none of your business.

230
00:25:50,965 --> 00:25:52,743
Period.

231
00:26:11,787 --> 00:26:12,788
Good afternoon!

232
00:26:12,788 --> 00:26:15,105
Do you have any
stowaways aboard?

233
00:26:15,705 --> 00:26:18,619
Even a mouse couldn't slip by me.

234
00:26:33,947 --> 00:26:38,243
Wake up! Let's grab
this little bastard.

235
00:26:45,712 --> 00:26:47,224
Get him!

236
00:27:21,545 --> 00:27:24,663
Get out! Run over there, quickly!

237
00:27:32,944 --> 00:27:34,370
Stand still!

238
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:22,712
Porfiry!

239
00:28:44,045 --> 00:28:48,703
Comrades! Comrades!
Leave the boy alone.

240
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:55,144
Stand still! Do you
think it's a game?

241
00:29:10,925 --> 00:29:14,398
What's the matter?

242
00:29:15,637 --> 00:29:17,683
Piss off. Come on, get out!

243
00:29:19,884 --> 00:29:24,028
It's not like he killed
anyone. Let him be.

244
00:29:24,187 --> 00:29:26,845
He didn't have a knife, did he?

245
00:29:26,971 --> 00:29:28,262
And what is it?

246
00:29:29,069 --> 00:29:30,519
Pull yourself together!

247
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:33,441
Why are you breaking
children's hands? Butchers.

248
00:29:33,441 --> 00:29:35,098
Let the child free.

249
00:29:35,098 --> 00:29:36,755
Why are you twisting his arms?

250
00:29:36,755 --> 00:29:41,003
Look at your fat face.
Twist your own child's hands.

251
00:29:41,003 --> 00:29:43,572
Let's go, Porfiry.

252
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:45,697
I won't give you to anyone.

253
00:29:45,697 --> 00:29:52,968
I'll take you to Kucuegury,
to be raised among lizards.

254
00:29:52,992 --> 00:29:54,992
Where's this intern girl?

255
00:30:49,484 --> 00:30:51,610
Do you know what you
get for running away?

256
00:30:53,253 --> 00:30:57,030
Punishment cell, no
more than three days.

257
00:30:57,030 --> 00:31:00,167
I glad you know.

258
00:31:00,167 --> 00:31:02,257
Get out.

259
00:31:17,124 --> 00:31:18,237
Okay, go.

260
00:31:18,237 --> 00:31:20,678
- To the punishment cell?
- To the bedroom.

261
00:31:20,785 --> 00:31:22,434
I'll manage without your pity.

262
00:31:22,634 --> 00:31:24,075
I'm going to the punishment cell.

263
00:31:24,175 --> 00:31:30,240
You're going to the bedroom,
to the spot you ran away from.

264
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:57,805
Kulbaka!

265
00:31:57,805 --> 00:32:01,116
Look what your running away has
brought us. Look at the windows.

266
00:32:01,138 --> 00:32:05,665
Yeah, and where did he run?
Right behind mama's skirt.

267
00:32:14,955 --> 00:32:19,393
It's terrible!

268
00:32:19,845 --> 00:32:22,800
It's the 20th century, and
we're still chasing people...

269
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,545
hunting them.

270
00:32:26,899 --> 00:32:28,612
It's meanly.

271
00:32:29,125 --> 00:32:30,974
I don't want to live.

272
00:32:30,974 --> 00:32:33,967
After this, how can I believe it
possible to destroy meanness...

273
00:32:33,967 --> 00:32:35,505
...cynicism, deceit?

274
00:32:35,505 --> 00:32:38,784
How can I look into his eyes?

275
00:32:38,784 --> 00:32:41,082
Tell me?!

276
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,848
If you could only see
how he stared at me.

277
00:32:56,392 --> 00:33:00,319
Tell me, is there a solution?
Because I can't see one.

278
00:33:01,219 --> 00:33:05,620
It's very bad, if
we've broken him.

279
00:33:05,621 --> 00:33:08,271
If he won't have it in
him to run away anymore.

280
00:33:08,407 --> 00:33:09,736
Yes, to run away.

281
00:33:11,636 --> 00:33:14,896
Even if it's strange to hear
on the school director's lips.

282
00:33:15,096 --> 00:33:17,121
Are you planning a
new breakout for him?

283
00:33:17,121 --> 00:33:20,642
Why new?

284
00:33:20,906 --> 00:33:24,183
Do you think that we've got him
back? We've only caught him.

285
00:33:26,357 --> 00:33:32,543
Now we must truly bring him
back to us, to the people.

286
00:33:43,311 --> 00:33:45,722
Porfiry! I envy you so much.

287
00:33:46,512 --> 00:33:49,537
You're so brave. I wouldn't
be able to do it.

288
00:33:49,781 --> 00:33:52,051
Weren't you afraid at all?

289
00:34:05,011 --> 00:34:06,863
My grandfather's
name was Porfiry.

290
00:34:06,863 --> 00:34:12,853
Mother gave me the
name in his honor.

291
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:14,358
Grandpa had 2 Orders of Glory.

292
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:18,871
There would be a third,
if he hadn't been injured.

293
00:34:18,871 --> 00:34:22,986
Grandpa always said:
"Courage drinks honey."

294
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:25,961
My father is also brave.

295
00:34:25,961 --> 00:34:30,156
He was a pilot during
the war. A fighter pilot.

296
00:34:30,156 --> 00:34:31,540
He made ram-attacks.

297
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:33,630
Also, I didn't run behind
my mother's skirt.

298
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,989
I went to the sea,
to Uncle Ivan.

299
00:34:35,989 --> 00:34:38,155
He was really fearless.

300
00:34:38,856 --> 00:34:41,343
Be careful!

301
00:34:45,014 --> 00:34:46,159
Hello.

302
00:34:48,731 --> 00:34:52,041
- What are you doing?
- I'm building a fence.

303
00:34:54,825 --> 00:34:56,303
Do you know how to mow?

304
00:34:57,403 --> 00:35:00,656
If you'll put all the hay
I've mowed into the haycock.

305
00:35:00,656 --> 00:35:02,666
Excellent!

306
00:35:02,666 --> 00:35:04,440
Here you go.

307
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,379
Guys! Do all of you
know how to mow?

308
00:35:06,379 --> 00:35:08,204
And how!

309
00:35:08,204 --> 00:35:09,538
Okay.

310
00:35:11,288 --> 00:35:13,816
This way.

311
00:35:13,816 --> 00:35:17,341
So, Anton Gerasimovich,
shall we relive our youth?

312
00:35:17,441 --> 00:35:18,765
We shall.

313
00:35:37,633 --> 00:35:39,957
Why are we leaving a strip?

314
00:35:39,957 --> 00:35:41,139
That won't do.

315
00:35:45,741 --> 00:35:47,520
This strip of grass is...

316
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:51,505
...a strip of uncut
wild flowers.

317
00:35:51,505 --> 00:35:54,683
It will be like a firm
fence for our camp.

318
00:35:54,883 --> 00:35:58,005
We must have a heart,
Don't you agree?

319
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:01,811
I want no part of this business.

320
00:36:02,611 --> 00:36:05,687
I have a heavy hand, it's true.

321
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:09,265
I got along without compassion.

322
00:36:09,265 --> 00:36:12,932
Life hasn't spoiled me.

323
00:36:12,996 --> 00:36:16,939
But I raised my children
right. They're not bums.

324
00:36:17,016 --> 00:36:21,231
One is a harpooner, the other a
drilling foreman in the Caspian.

325
00:36:21,731 --> 00:36:24,608
My son has earned two Orders.

326
00:36:24,608 --> 00:36:27,944
It turns out my pedagogy
is worth something.

327
00:36:28,945 --> 00:36:31,111
What is this?

328
00:36:33,784 --> 00:36:35,320
What is this,
I ask you?

329
00:36:45,686 --> 00:36:50,042
I think the summer camp ought
to be built in the schoolyard.

330
00:36:55,761 --> 00:36:57,760
Pupil Butkevich!

331
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,761
Your father has come.

332
00:37:02,893 --> 00:37:03,935
Gena!

333
00:37:04,035 --> 00:37:05,319
Father has come.

334
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:21,967
Have you gone nuts?

335
00:37:22,053 --> 00:37:24,729
Run to your father, or
he won't come anymore.

336
00:37:27,004 --> 00:37:29,963
Let him go. Let him
not come again.

337
00:37:31,164 --> 00:37:33,366
But you were saying
he made ram-attacks.

338
00:37:33,467 --> 00:37:36,214
Gena, you must understand,
he's your father.

339
00:37:36,915 --> 00:37:39,041
A traitor, he's a traitor!

340
00:37:48,778 --> 00:37:51,859
Yes, I know he doesn't want me
visiting. He wrote me about it.

341
00:37:51,859 --> 00:37:55,348
But I had to come, to hear a
word, to take a look at him.

342
00:37:55,348 --> 00:37:58,234
I wanted it for some reason, so
here I am. And what a reception!

343
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:03,132
He thinks I betrayed him and
his mother, by marrying again.

344
00:38:03,132 --> 00:38:07,836
His mother died in a crash. He
says I traded him for a stepmom.

345
00:38:07,836 --> 00:38:11,097
It all began with that. Now he's
with this gang of hooligans.

346
00:38:11,097 --> 00:38:15,144
I fought, did everything I could
to improve his surroundings.

347
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,773
I moved away from the capital.
I was a chair in architecture.

348
00:38:17,773 --> 00:38:23,867
Do you think that it's easy
to sacrifice such a position?

349
00:38:23,867 --> 00:38:24,394
But the sacrifices were in vain.

350
00:38:24,394 --> 00:38:26,130
Again came the black marks on
his record, the vagabondage.

351
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:30,744
What he was lacking?

352
00:38:30,744 --> 00:38:34,433
Maybe just pigeon milk.
But he didn't even want to see me.

353
00:38:34,433 --> 00:38:36,773
I know very well this problem
has existed for centuries.

354
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:41,710
Education is an eternal problem.
But why is this problem mine?

355
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:46,095
My son didn't want to see me.
He turned away from me.

356
00:38:46,095 --> 00:38:51,625
You're professionals, so tell me:
why more and more problem children?

357
00:38:51,625 --> 00:38:53,891
There have to be some reasons.

358
00:38:53,891 --> 00:38:55,829
But what should I do?

359
00:38:55,829 --> 00:39:00,150
I have entrusted my only child's
education to you, strangers.

360
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:02,567
For us, the generation of
battlefront destitution...

361
00:39:02,567 --> 00:39:08,733
...we hope to see our kids, who
grow among beauty and comfort...

362
00:39:08,733 --> 00:39:13,623
...become spiritually beautiful.
He didn't even want to look at me.

363
00:39:13,623 --> 00:39:16,911
I've refused him nothing.
I even brought a gift.

364
00:39:16,911 --> 00:39:21,281
Tell me it's just a teen thing.
Maybe he will grow out of it?

365
00:39:21,281 --> 00:39:24,187
Or have I lost him forever?

366
00:39:24,187 --> 00:39:25,672
I've brought a gift for him.

367
00:39:25,672 --> 00:39:28,826
It's a boat.
A very expensive gift.

368
00:39:28,826 --> 00:39:32,579
Is there any way to win
him back, to break the ice?

369
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:36,227
I understand everything, I do, but
is he really convinced I'm his enemy?

370
00:39:36,227 --> 00:39:37,436
Tell me, please.

371
00:39:37,605 --> 00:39:38,821
Why did you come?

372
00:39:39,974 --> 00:39:42,210
Do you want to traumatize
him even more?

373
00:39:42,211 --> 00:39:44,343
What am I to do?

374
00:39:44,343 --> 00:39:46,784
You know very well that
after your previous visit...

375
00:39:46,784 --> 00:39:49,225
...he spent a week
in the clinic.

376
00:39:49,225 --> 00:39:51,122
And what am I supposed to do?

377
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:55,828
Go away, and don't come
back until we call for you.

378
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:00,766
Here, like in a hospital...

379
00:40:00,766 --> 00:40:06,070
...we deal with the injured,
the traumatized.

380
00:40:07,108 --> 00:40:11,684
Even if they're rudely
called "offenders."

381
00:40:13,669 --> 00:40:17,501
Regarding your present,
don't even show it to him.

382
00:40:47,102 --> 00:40:49,095
"SPECIAL SCHOOL"

383
00:41:03,817 --> 00:41:09,889
"MOTHER"

384
00:41:30,662 --> 00:41:33,096
Gena, go look for Porfiry.

385
00:41:58,082 --> 00:41:59,792
No! I said it's not allowed!

386
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:01,751
How did they let you in?

387
00:42:01,851 --> 00:42:03,420
Let me see my son.

388
00:42:04,921 --> 00:42:07,264
Come in.

389
00:42:07,264 --> 00:42:09,053
I want to see my son.

390
00:42:09,153 --> 00:42:11,054
You should drink less.

391
00:42:11,378 --> 00:42:13,145
I don't drink at all!

392
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:20,788
Come over here, please.

393
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:22,895
What do you have here?

394
00:42:24,815 --> 00:42:25,652
What are these?!

395
00:42:25,652 --> 00:42:28,541
So what? He's been smoking
since the third grade.

396
00:42:30,293 --> 00:42:31,727
And this is honey.

397
00:42:32,577 --> 00:42:37,802
My precious son. My happiness.

398
00:42:59,842 --> 00:43:04,878
"WE'VE WORKED, NOW
LET'S HAVE A REST."

399
00:43:07,907 --> 00:43:08,919
What is it?

400
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:11,148
The bosses are making
a movie about us.

401
00:43:17,541 --> 00:43:18,853
Nope, can't find him anywhere.

402
00:43:19,253 --> 00:43:22,023
Go, look again.

403
00:43:31,253 --> 00:43:37,110
The main event in today's
program is the sack race.

404
00:43:43,952 --> 00:43:47,838
First prize will be mine.
There's nothing you can do.

405
00:43:55,463 --> 00:43:58,455
Cake!!!

406
00:43:59,963 --> 00:44:02,437
No, a roasted chicken.

407
00:44:02,837 --> 00:44:04,479
Even better.

408
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:06,953
Better for me.
I like it roasted.

409
00:44:07,118 --> 00:44:08,440
Ready, go!

410
00:45:14,356 --> 00:45:16,356
Quiet, lads, be quiet.

411
00:45:17,144 --> 00:45:19,237
The winner's speech.

412
00:45:19,537 --> 00:45:24,342
Open, open the gates for me!
I'll sack-race all the way home.

413
00:45:24,742 --> 00:45:27,321
Please, take it.

414
00:45:52,637 --> 00:45:54,402
Hey, you! Actors.
You'll get soaked!

415
00:45:54,502 --> 00:45:57,071
Lads, run away from
the stage. Run!

416
00:45:57,371 --> 00:46:00,485
We're firemen. We have
no fear of water.

417
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:10,777
Well done, well done!

418
00:47:53,777 --> 00:47:58,081
Cherry Troopers! Line up.

419
00:47:59,703 --> 00:48:02,327
Faster, faster.

420
00:48:09,971 --> 00:48:14,294
Attention!

421
00:48:15,514 --> 00:48:17,537
To recap yesterday's results:

422
00:48:17,937 --> 00:48:23,399
Pupil Kulba was the winner
of the socialism competition.

423
00:48:24,499 --> 00:48:26,859
Kulbaka, take three steps forward.

424
00:48:30,817 --> 00:48:32,322
Congratulations!

425
00:48:32,522 --> 00:48:38,028
Today, he'll be awarded with a
transitional leader's jersey.

426
00:48:46,834 --> 00:48:48,502
- Help yourself!
- Thank you.

427
00:48:49,458 --> 00:48:51,768
Take more. It's not enough.

428
00:48:52,434 --> 00:48:53,338
Enough.

429
00:48:53,538 --> 00:48:56,108
Kulbaka, join the line-up.

430
00:49:00,216 --> 00:49:02,394
Congratulations to all!

431
00:49:03,411 --> 00:49:09,006
The leaders of the "Steppe Giant"
sovkhoz are pleased by your work.

432
00:49:12,294 --> 00:49:13,963
And now, back to it. Keep it up!

433
00:49:13,963 --> 00:49:15,370
Break it up.

434
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:17,004
As you were!

435
00:49:17,045 --> 00:49:19,313
Why are you still shod?
Take off your shoes.

436
00:49:44,683 --> 00:49:46,387
Hey, little workers!

437
00:49:46,587 --> 00:49:50,951
Come here, come, come.

438
00:49:51,999 --> 00:49:53,959
Feast your eyes upon your work.

439
00:49:54,059 --> 00:49:55,521
What happened?

440
00:49:55,621 --> 00:49:57,175
Shame on you!

441
00:49:57,375 --> 00:50:02,444
Only the top layer is
covered with cherries.

442
00:50:02,678 --> 00:50:04,221
What do you call this?

443
00:50:04,221 --> 00:50:06,242
It was returned by the cannery.

444
00:50:08,843 --> 00:50:11,104
This hasn't happened
for centuries!

445
00:50:11,104 --> 00:50:11,873
Whose work is this?

446
00:50:12,073 --> 00:50:13,602
Confess! Whose work is this?

447
00:50:13,702 --> 00:50:16,448
It's your work. Why are
you silent? Tell me!

448
00:50:16,548 --> 00:50:17,758
It's not his.

449
00:50:17,758 --> 00:50:18,777
Whose then?

450
00:50:18,777 --> 00:50:20,507
It's his. The striker's.

451
00:50:20,707 --> 00:50:23,308
So it's you, the
striker. Come here.

452
00:50:23,708 --> 00:50:25,318
He didn't do it.

453
00:50:27,171 --> 00:50:28,984
What were you talking about,
esprit de corps. For shame!

454
00:50:29,184 --> 00:50:30,864
Take off the shirt.

455
00:50:32,189 --> 00:50:34,314
Don't touch me, don't!

456
00:50:38,688 --> 00:50:39,941
Get on your spots!

457
00:50:41,414 --> 00:50:43,651
You've eaten your fill.
No sweets for you.

458
00:50:44,051 --> 00:50:46,079
You'll sing all day long.

459
00:50:46,365 --> 00:50:47,983
Don't touch me.

460
00:50:48,183 --> 00:50:52,108
Sing, all of you, so I can see
what your mouths are busy with.

461
00:50:52,208 --> 00:50:55,457
No cherries. I told
you, no cherries!

462
00:50:55,457 --> 00:50:57,521
Sing, all of you!

463
00:51:31,011 --> 00:51:34,632
Well, Valery Ivanovich...a
mass escape from the garden.

464
00:51:45,621 --> 00:51:50,233
And one of the ringleaders
is your little Kulba.

465
00:51:50,533 --> 00:51:52,191
I warned you.

466
00:51:52,391 --> 00:51:55,212
You should put the camp
in the school's backyard.

467
00:51:55,312 --> 00:51:57,464
Put the tents behind the wall.

468
00:51:57,764 --> 00:52:00,768
There's plenty of space.
The yard is big.

469
00:52:00,968 --> 00:52:04,791
Let them live right out
there the whole summer.

470
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:13,792
You won't have my agreement
for your herbaceous border.

471
00:52:45,141 --> 00:52:45,853
Valery...

472
00:52:45,953 --> 00:52:48,619
Keep silent!
On your spot, quickly!

473
00:52:48,815 --> 00:52:50,628
It's my error. Mine.

474
00:52:50,928 --> 00:52:54,578
Why did I have to send
this blockhead with them?

475
00:52:54,978 --> 00:52:59,646
He only causes conflict, and
embitters them against us.

476
00:52:59,846 --> 00:53:03,757
He must be kicked out at once.

477
00:53:16,739 --> 00:53:17,982
Hello, sir.

478
00:53:18,958 --> 00:53:20,565
Hello.

479
00:53:24,709 --> 00:53:28,057
Valery Ivanovich, I've bad news.

480
00:53:28,218 --> 00:53:32,746
Herders found a dead man in a
car on the steppe. Heart attack.

481
00:53:33,552 --> 00:53:36,561
We found out that he came
here to visit his son.

482
00:53:36,561 --> 00:53:38,410
He is Gena Butkevich's father.

483
00:53:39,003 --> 00:53:42,231
Here is his keychain,
with his son's picture.

484
00:53:46,127 --> 00:53:47,362
Where is Gena Butkevich?

485
00:53:47,462 --> 00:53:49,627
He hasn't come back yet.

486
00:53:51,861 --> 00:53:55,260
I solemnly beg you,
don't tell anyone.

487
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:58,673
The kid shouldn't hear about
this through the grapevine.

488
00:53:58,673 --> 00:54:01,310
I'll talk to him myself.

489
00:54:01,310 --> 00:54:02,064
Okay.

490
00:54:04,141 --> 00:54:05,896
There are three more who
have not come back.

491
00:54:06,238 --> 00:54:09,645
We should send for a driver and
go straight to Kulbaka's home...

492
00:54:09,645 --> 00:54:12,165
...and wait for them
'til tomorrow morning.

493
00:54:15,311 --> 00:54:18,434
They won't allow an old man
like me to sleep today.

494
00:54:18,434 --> 00:54:20,639
Take a rest, Anton Gerasimovich.

495
00:54:21,798 --> 00:54:23,700
What do you mean, "take a rest"?

496
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:26,469
This time, you stay
here at the school.

497
00:54:26,669 --> 00:54:29,408
The search party already left.

498
00:54:30,105 --> 00:54:31,833
What's the meaning of this?

499
00:54:32,598 --> 00:54:35,213
Don't chafe, Anton Gerasimovich.

500
00:54:35,313 --> 00:54:37,672
Sir, it'll be night soon.

501
00:54:38,248 --> 00:54:40,744
These people are younger than us.

502
00:54:41,218 --> 00:54:45,674
Also, she's a teacher. A pedagogue.

503
00:54:46,578 --> 00:54:48,150
I don't meddle in pedagogy.

504
00:54:48,959 --> 00:54:52,859
I'm head of the administration.
I know whom I'm dealing with.

505
00:54:52,859 --> 00:54:58,883
Those three are real masters. They
could teach a rabbit to set fires.

506
00:54:59,668 --> 00:55:04,406
What they need is a jail,
and you've pampered them.

507
00:55:04,794 --> 00:55:06,487
Take a rest.

508
00:56:14,263 --> 00:56:15,967
Eat.

509
00:56:19,263 --> 00:56:22,470
Just think of it, falling behind 
and getting lost on a field trip.

510
00:56:25,663 --> 00:56:31,825
Never mind, the guys will come
to have dinner. They'll help.

511
00:56:46,514 --> 00:56:48,630
They've worked up a good appetite.

512
00:56:48,630 --> 00:56:53,007
They're waving their spoons
like oars in a boat race.

513
00:56:53,207 --> 00:56:56,784
What did I tell you?
Hunger will drive them here.

514
00:56:56,784 --> 00:57:00,113
Should we arrest them now or let
them fortify themselves first?

515
00:57:00,113 --> 00:57:01,747
Let them fortify themselves.

516
00:57:02,350 --> 00:57:05,193
They still have a long time
to walk across that steppe.

517
00:57:05,193 --> 00:57:07,551
What do you mean, "a long time"?

518
00:57:17,537 --> 00:57:19,712
'Til they understand on their own.

519
00:57:29,544 --> 00:57:31,142
They're coming. Run!

520
00:58:20,583 --> 00:58:23,643
- It's not funny. She thinks
we were killed. - Killed.

521
00:58:23,679 --> 00:58:26,381
- She fired into the air.
- You bet she did.

522
00:58:26,405 --> 00:58:30,969
Of course she did. Who wants to suffer
all through life, to be a murderer?

523
00:58:31,374 --> 00:58:33,719
There are archaeologists
working on the steppe now.

524
00:58:34,993 --> 00:58:36,520
Let's join them.

525
00:58:36,988 --> 00:58:40,544
I heard they're hiring
teenagers for odd jobs.

526
00:58:40,544 --> 00:58:41,631
It could be interesting.

527
00:58:41,631 --> 00:58:43,446
To swing a shovel all day?

528
00:58:43,446 --> 00:58:45,455
Only fools and horses work.

529
00:58:45,979 --> 00:58:49,506
It's better to go my brother's.
He's well-settled over there.

530
00:58:49,706 --> 00:58:51,671
He cooks shashliks [shish kebab]
and chebureks [turnovers].

531
00:58:51,771 --> 00:58:54,949
He bakes pastries
as big as bast shoes.

532
00:58:54,949 --> 00:58:57,205
Express train!

533
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:07,832
Serpent. I hate it!

534
00:59:09,056 --> 00:59:11,256
You haul vacationers to the sea.

535
00:59:15,435 --> 00:59:19,070
Mamas' boys are fed with cakes.

536
00:59:21,356 --> 00:59:24,864
Take that...right
between the curtains.

537
00:59:27,995 --> 00:59:31,729
Have you seen this?

538
00:59:32,906 --> 00:59:37,875
While someone was sack-racing
for a roasted chicken...

539
00:59:41,102 --> 00:59:44,668
I grabbed something.

540
00:59:44,761 --> 00:59:45,645
A real gun.

541
00:59:45,745 --> 00:59:47,570
Give me the money.

542
00:59:50,122 --> 00:59:53,877
Your hands are shaking, as if
you were stealing chickens.

543
01:00:30,826 --> 01:00:32,961
Uncle Vanya, where are you?

544
01:00:37,642 --> 01:00:41,616
Hold on, Porfiry.
I'm here. Hold on!

545
01:00:45,833 --> 01:00:47,442
Two of us won't manage.

546
01:00:51,423 --> 01:00:54,622
Guys! Help!

547
01:00:56,622 --> 01:00:58,766
We're with you, Porfiry.

548
01:00:59,166 --> 01:01:01,367
Cover it with sand.

549
01:01:47,987 --> 01:01:51,513
Look, a picture.

550
01:01:51,513 --> 01:01:54,082
It's not a picture,
it's a sculpture.

551
01:01:56,645 --> 01:02:00,629
No, lads, we're hallucinating
due to hunger. It's a mirage.

552
01:02:10,189 --> 01:02:14,433
- Hey, uncle, lend me
your boots. - Take them.

553
01:02:25,330 --> 01:02:26,999
They're too small.

554
01:02:28,674 --> 01:02:30,751
Watch out! A car!

555
01:03:12,358 --> 01:03:14,048
The flower bed grows for me.

556
01:03:16,482 --> 01:03:19,630
Do not touch it, don't!
Are you the one who planted it?

557
01:04:04,950 --> 01:04:10,238
It's a pity I don't have my Finnish
knife on me...but we'll meet again.

558
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,251
Beast. He dares threaten me.

559
01:04:36,991 --> 01:04:38,641
What's the matter with you?

560
01:04:43,447 --> 01:04:45,102
Why are you laughing?

561
01:04:45,102 --> 01:04:47,368
Hold on. Hold on.

562
01:04:53,221 --> 01:04:55,365
Hold on. Why are you laughing?

563
01:04:56,406 --> 01:04:58,901
He didn't even notice it.

564
01:05:01,311 --> 01:05:02,881
What do we need it for?

565
01:05:02,881 --> 01:05:07,400
That skunk wanted to rob
a cash-desk with it.

566
01:05:10,742 --> 01:05:11,977
What now?

567
01:05:12,077 --> 01:05:15,028
We should make for the coast,
go to Uncle Vanya.

568
01:05:15,028 --> 01:05:16,812
He can make use of us.

569
01:05:16,812 --> 01:05:23,133
It's said, the inspector's son bit off
a poacher's finger defending his dad.

570
01:05:23,133 --> 01:05:25,500
I could also have
done it, couldn't I?

571
01:05:26,159 --> 01:05:28,318
I couldn't bite off a finger.

572
01:05:28,318 --> 01:05:30,731
Do you think Uncle Vanya will take us?

573
01:05:30,731 --> 01:05:35,228
Of course he will. You still don't
understand what kind of man he is!

574
01:05:35,228 --> 01:05:36,621
Listen to this:

575
01:05:36,621 --> 01:05:41,391
One night, one autumn...

576
01:05:43,488 --> 01:05:46,663
...some poachers were catching
fish with nets in the bay...

577
01:05:46,663 --> 01:05:48,802
...when suddenly Uncle Vanya
emerged from the reeds...

578
01:05:56,672 --> 01:05:58,530
Then one of them fired a rifle.

579
01:05:59,056 --> 01:06:03,875
But Uncle Vanya wasn't scared,
and jumped into their boat...

580
01:06:04,075 --> 01:06:07,255
They were strong, like two bulls.
They threw him into the water.

581
01:06:07,651 --> 01:06:10,774
But he stubbornly climbed back in.

582
01:06:12,952 --> 01:06:17,171
They hit him with the paddle,
but he kept hanging on.

583
01:06:17,603 --> 01:06:22,764
His iron fist found the teeth
of first one, then the other.

584
01:06:25,923 --> 01:06:30,311
They pressed him from two sides,
hit him on his ribs, his head.

585
01:06:34,267 --> 01:06:38,427
But he smashed the big galoot in
the teeth, again in the teeth.

586
01:06:41,524 --> 01:06:44,930
The other attacked with the paddle,
but he hit him in the teeth too.

587
01:06:47,762 --> 01:06:56,070
They kicked and hit him in the head,
the liver, the ribs. But he hung on.

588
01:07:00,541 --> 01:07:03,625
They threw him into the water.

589
01:07:07,928 --> 01:07:10,880
All rise. The court
is now in session.

590
01:07:33,909 --> 01:07:36,858
We now call the witness Kulbaka.

591
01:07:59,468 --> 01:08:03,396
I recognize you.

592
01:08:04,357 --> 01:08:05,646
And you too.

593
01:08:07,068 --> 01:08:09,339
All of you.

594
01:08:09,902 --> 01:08:12,291
You thought I had drowned?

595
01:08:12,491 --> 01:08:22,140
Here I am, and I won't give you
poachers, you skunks, a break.

596
01:08:24,358 --> 01:08:26,860
The verdict is delivered.

597
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:31,248
Shave off their hair!

598
01:09:46,616 --> 01:09:53,402
My son, what are you doing to me?

599
01:09:54,708 --> 01:09:58,526
I've had to get by all alone.
I've suffered enough with you.

600
01:09:58,526 --> 01:10:05,392
I'm ashamed, son,
totally ashamed.

601
01:10:06,609 --> 01:10:13,628
What am I to do, darling
Porfiry, my only son?

602
01:10:14,428 --> 01:10:20,359
I'm alone with you. Why are
you not listening to me?

603
01:10:21,446 --> 01:10:28,721
You're my sprig, my baby,
my lovely child.

604
01:10:33,137 --> 01:10:36,483
We have not overlooked them.

605
01:10:36,483 --> 01:10:38,388
It's good that we caught
at least one of them.

606
01:10:38,588 --> 01:10:40,377
I mean, it's bad.

607
01:10:40,477 --> 01:10:43,263
They arrested him as he tried to
rob a stall. Here's the telegram.

608
01:10:43,263 --> 01:10:45,062
Has he got a gun on him?

609
01:10:45,062 --> 01:10:46,810
What gun?

610
01:10:48,797 --> 01:10:50,810
The starter pistol is missing.

611
01:10:51,877 --> 01:10:53,731
I'd completely forgotten it.

612
01:10:54,391 --> 01:10:58,408
It always stays in
my iron cabinet.

613
01:10:58,603 --> 01:11:02,844
I remember it went missing
after the sack race.

614
01:11:03,044 --> 01:11:06,311
Do you remember what a commotion
happened when the rain began?

615
01:11:06,511 --> 01:11:08,717
In short, I have no excuse.

616
01:11:08,833 --> 01:11:10,087
But it means those
two have the gun.

617
01:11:10,187 --> 01:11:13,334
Look who's talking. I was
chasing him 10 years ago.

618
01:11:13,334 --> 01:11:16,343
I've written reports on him,
and he should know better.

619
01:11:16,343 --> 01:11:19,976
Neither Porfiry nor Gena
could do such a thing.

620
01:11:20,176 --> 01:11:23,314
Why can't you understand that
they'll come back on their own?

621
01:11:23,379 --> 01:11:25,277
That's the most important part.

622
01:11:25,314 --> 01:11:28,827
If we seize them again, like
before, we'll lose them forever.

623
01:11:31,786 --> 01:11:34,533
I beg you, give them
another three days.

624
01:11:34,533 --> 01:11:38,859
If something happens, which it
won't, I will take the blame.

625
01:11:39,159 --> 01:11:42,092
With your educational methods, you
won't be waiting long for that.

626
01:11:43,292 --> 01:11:45,910
It concerns you too,
with your "iron cabinet."

627
01:11:46,610 --> 01:11:52,467
They'll be caught without us. The
investigation's already open. I called.

628
01:12:07,426 --> 01:12:10,290
How long will we sleep here?

629
01:12:22,254 --> 01:12:25,344
Here, eat it and don't grumble.

630
01:12:27,424 --> 01:12:29,168
I'm sick of those cucumbers.

631
01:12:29,168 --> 01:12:31,044
Where's your Uncle Ivan?

632
01:12:34,740 --> 01:12:37,462
He'll come tomorrow,
for certain. You'll see.

633
01:12:38,886 --> 01:12:42,245
Enough, now, I'll tell you
what's going to happen.

634
01:12:42,245 --> 01:12:45,394
It's not going to happen
the way you've laid out.

635
01:12:46,874 --> 01:12:53,139
A boat will appear in the morning,
and in the boat, Uncle Ivan.

636
01:13:03,727 --> 01:13:09,561
Uncle Ivan will get out and say:
"Porfiry, get up. Do you hear me?"

637
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:17,299
And you'll tell him: "Sir, we've
been waiting for you for two days."

638
01:13:17,699 --> 01:13:24,437
He'll answer: "I know, I came just for
you. You overslept, you waiter-fors."

639
01:13:24,637 --> 01:13:28,247
And we'll ask him: "Uncle Ivan,
please take us with you."

640
01:13:28,447 --> 01:13:33,432
"Sir, we'll help you,
to build fires, to choose nets."

641
01:13:59,228 --> 01:14:03,970
And he'll answer: "Well, boys,
I'd love to have helpers."

642
01:14:05,170 --> 01:14:11,094
"But don't you think it's better
to go visit your mom first?"

643
01:14:11,094 --> 01:14:16,401
"She's probably desperate,
her son is again on the run."

644
01:14:17,376 --> 01:14:21,051
"Go, you know the
way. It's not far."

645
01:14:21,905 --> 01:14:25,731
"Do you want me to send both
of you back where you belong?"

646
01:14:26,131 --> 01:14:30,821
"I wouldn't do that. You have your
own heads on your own shoulders."

647
01:14:31,045 --> 01:14:33,445
"You can decide for yourselves!"

648
01:14:34,021 --> 01:14:41,687
"Remember, boys, the greatest
victory is that won over yourself."

649
01:14:41,787 --> 01:14:43,444
"Do both of you understand me?"

650
01:14:47,814 --> 01:14:49,932
There are other fish in the
sea, besides Uncle Ivan.

651
01:14:50,132 --> 01:14:52,780
Gena, just take it easy.
We can move further along.

652
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:57,779
I bet my father has come and
is waiting for me over there.

653
01:14:59,031 --> 01:15:00,441
Do you want to run away from me?

654
01:15:00,541 --> 01:15:03,618
No, not at all.

655
01:15:04,018 --> 01:15:06,927
And if they catch us with the gun?

656
01:15:07,551 --> 01:15:09,640
Let's throw it away.

657
01:15:10,164 --> 01:15:11,664
Okay.

658
01:15:21,305 --> 01:15:22,326
That's that.

659
01:15:23,126 --> 01:15:28,035
Let's get on a freight train,
and let them chase the wind.

660
01:15:28,035 --> 01:15:30,164
He'll get put on trial.

661
01:15:32,038 --> 01:15:33,557
Who?

662
01:15:34,023 --> 01:15:35,723
Our gym teacher.

663
01:15:36,023 --> 01:15:37,517
Why?

664
01:15:37,617 --> 01:15:39,835
For losing the gun.

665
01:15:42,021 --> 01:15:45,932
What do you suggest?

666
01:15:45,932 --> 01:15:48,709
Fish it out and take
it back to the school.

667
01:15:50,291 --> 01:15:51,819
Bring it back ourselves?

668
01:15:51,919 --> 01:15:55,638
No, just throw it over the fence.

669
01:15:57,985 --> 01:16:01,813
Well, why couldn't you
have said that before?

670
01:16:14,747 --> 01:16:16,267
Nothing.

671
01:16:38,494 --> 01:16:39,966
It's too dark down there.

672
01:16:54,165 --> 01:16:58,385
Here it is. I found it.

673
01:17:28,793 --> 01:17:34,474
You know, Gena, to be honest
I don't have any Uncle Ivan.

674
01:17:35,427 --> 01:17:38,653
I knew that a long time ago,
but why did you lie to me?

675
01:17:38,953 --> 01:17:44,187
I didn't mean to. You have
a father, but as for me...

676
01:19:40,419 --> 01:19:41,931
This is it. Let's crawl away.

677
01:19:42,031 --> 01:19:43,532
What about the gun?

678
01:19:43,632 --> 01:19:46,193
It's in the staff room, on
the table, like we agreed.

679
01:19:47,617 --> 01:19:49,117
Cinema! Cinema!

680
01:19:49,557 --> 01:19:51,705
What's the hurry?
Let's watch the movie.

681
01:19:52,005 --> 01:19:55,267
OK. We won't be able to
go to the cinema soon.

682
01:19:57,320 --> 01:19:59,982
But after the movie, we're
immediately scooting away.

683
01:20:00,982 --> 01:20:06,068
Porfiry, you know, our director
is just like your Uncle Ivan.

684
01:20:06,268 --> 01:20:07,548
The spitting image of him.

685
01:20:07,748 --> 01:20:13,149
The whole time you were telling me
about him, I pictured our director.

686
01:21:39,250 --> 01:21:40,654
