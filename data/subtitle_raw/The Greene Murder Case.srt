1
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,510
Come in.

2
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,130
Mr. Canon is here, sir.

3
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,010
Mr. Canon?
Yes.

4
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,370
Oh yeah.
In your mother's room.

5
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,860
Oh yeah.

6
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,650
Well, each year finds you better, Mrs. Greene.
It does not!

7
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:39,000
Nurse, tell Miss Ada to come here.

8
00:02:39,001 --> 00:02:45,000
Hello Mr. Canon.
Well, fire away, Canon!

9
00:02:45,001 --> 00:02:49,049
Chester!
See, what do I matter?

10
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,333
A paralyzed old woman like me.

11
00:02:51,334 --> 00:02:56,729
Ada, the only comfort
of all these ungrateful children.

12
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:59,730
And she only pretends to love me.

13
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,480
Miss Sibella.
Alley-oop.

14
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,666
Mr. Rex. Good evening.
What's good about it?

15
00:03:08,667 --> 00:03:10,444
Or any other evening in this house.

16
00:03:10,445 --> 00:03:15,444
I must say, 10 years of these meetings
have made me dislike being a policeman

17
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:21,509
as much as you dislike each other.
But as you know, your father's will requires

18
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:27,120
me to determine every year whether you have
lived according to the provisions thereof.

19
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:34,109
And to remind you, that you must live in this
house and maintain this property intact for

20
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:41,777
15 years after your father's and husband's
death, that's five years more, or be disinherited.

21
00:03:41,778 --> 00:03:47,444
And then on this date, 1900 and 34,
if you have carried out this provision,

22
00:03:47,445 --> 00:03:52,666
the estate will be divided equally between you,
or in the event of death,

23
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:56,777
between any of you who are still alive.
Have you got a match?

24
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Ah, remembering, of course,
the bequest to the servants

25
00:04:09,001 --> 00:04:11,370
who have been with you
since the death of Mr. Greene.

26
00:04:11,371 --> 00:04:15,888
Sibella! Put that out!
Uh-humm.

27
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:21,000
And the exception that Miss Ada,
not being of the family blood,

28
00:04:21,001 --> 00:04:24,111
may live elsewhere if she marries.

29
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:31,410
Now, Mrs. Greene, you haven't left the house?
Use your head, you fool!

30
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,888
How could I? Haven't I...

31
00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:39,444
...been lying here for 10 years making life
miserable for everybody, including myself.

32
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,666
Oh shut up!
See!

33
00:04:41,667 --> 00:04:44,888
Well, Chester?
Still here.

34
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:48,000
Miss Sibella?
In person!

35
00:04:48,001 --> 00:04:53,110
Sibella, where are you going?
To the theater, little buttercup.

36
00:04:53,111 --> 00:04:56,666
With...uh... with Arthur?
Yes, darling.

37
00:04:56,667 --> 00:05:00,554
You're after Arthur yourself now, eh?
Stop it!

38
00:05:00,555 --> 00:05:03,555
Mr. Rex?
Why, certainly I've been here!

39
00:05:03,556 --> 00:05:05,444
Thank you, thank you.

40
00:05:05,445 --> 00:05:08,790
And going crazy in the middle
of this loving family!

41
00:05:10,555 --> 00:05:13,740
Uh, Miss Ada. Miss Ada?

42
00:05:15,179 --> 00:05:16,319
Yes, I'm here.

43
00:05:17,777 --> 00:05:20,250
Well, that's everybody.
Thank you.

44
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:26,340
Good evening.

45
00:05:28,444 --> 00:05:30,222
Good evening.

46
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,666
Ada.
Yes, Mother?

47
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:49,111
Bring me my bullion.
Yes, Mother.

48
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:12,555
The lawyer was here again. But the law
can't chase the devil out of this house.

49
00:06:12,556 --> 00:06:17,444
It's a wicked family, doomed to death!
Shhh!

50
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,555
Here, mein herr.
Thank you, Gretchen.

51
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:30,420
[German]

52
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:38,111
How did you know about the family?
From the Lord!

53
00:06:38,112 --> 00:06:41,444
All the Greenes are doomed, so they are!

54
00:06:41,445 --> 00:06:46,444
Hating each other like poison
and rotting with evil both.

55
00:06:46,445 --> 00:06:50,333
I shall rise up against them,
saith the Lord of hosts.

56
00:06:50,334 --> 00:06:53,610
And sweep them with
a besom of destruction!

57
00:07:06,029 --> 00:07:07,289
Now read to me.

58
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:14,280
Oh, no, no, no. The novel,
where you left off last night.

59
00:07:14,281 --> 00:07:15,888
All right.

60
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:24,610
Well, it stopped snowing anyways.
Oh, I'm awfully sorry.

61
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:32,000
In five minutes we were outside the door
starting upon our expedition.

62
00:07:32,001 --> 00:07:34,950
We hurried thru the dark shrubbery
amid the doubt...

63
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:31,140
Come in.

64
00:09:07,111 --> 00:09:20,000
Rex? Ada? Nurse? What happened?
Why doesn't somebody come? Ada? Sibella? Rex?

65
00:09:20,001 --> 00:09:27,555
I'm all alone. Chester? Anybody?
Where are you?

66
00:09:27,556 --> 00:09:32,333
Something's happened.
And I'm alone.

67
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:35,555
Why don't you come, you filthy children?

68
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,777
It's your mother.
Call Dr. Von Blon.

69
00:09:42,778 --> 00:09:46,888
What's the trouble?
It's Mr. Chester and Miss Ada. They've been shot.

70
00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:50,199
Are they dead? Did you see anybody?
No. I'm trying to get Dr. Von Blon...

71
00:10:00,301 --> 00:10:03,444
Yes, the newspapers had it right.

72
00:10:03,445 --> 00:10:07,444
Chester Greene was killed instantly,
but the girl was only wounded.

73
00:10:07,445 --> 00:10:12,777
Why of course it was attempted robbery.
Why, the silverware alone was...

74
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:16,111
Just a moment.
It's Philo Vance.

75
00:10:16,112 --> 00:10:18,000
What's the matter?
Somebody been bumped off?

76
00:10:18,001 --> 00:10:21,111
Oh, it's this Greene business.
Oh, that job.

77
00:10:21,112 --> 00:10:25,111
It's the first case in which Vance has shown
any interest since the Canary murder.

78
00:10:25,112 --> 00:10:29,333
That's right.
You see, he doesn't go for your burglar theory.

79
00:10:29,334 --> 00:10:31,111
He don't, eh?
No.

80
00:10:31,112 --> 00:10:32,777
Well...
Want to talk to him?

81
00:10:32,778 --> 00:10:37,111
Sure.
Hello Mr. Vance.

82
00:10:37,112 --> 00:10:41,444
This is Sergeant Heath talking.
Oh, good morning, Sergeant.

83
00:10:41,445 --> 00:10:46,444
Say, what's wrong with the burglar theory
in that Greene case?

84
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:49,555
Well nothing, Sergeant, except, uh...

85
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,333
Uh...

86
00:10:53,334 --> 00:10:57,888
Doesn't it strike you as rather odd
that a burglar should dally about

87
00:10:57,889 --> 00:11:00,777
in the hall for three minutes
between the two shots?

88
00:11:00,778 --> 00:11:04,111
Why no, he just... uh...

89
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:09,000
Say, Mr. Vance, maybe you could uh...

90
00:11:09,777 --> 00:11:13,222
Thank you, Sergeant.
I'll be ready in half an hour.

91
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,111
He'll be ready in half an hour.

92
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:23,000
Thank you, Sergeant.
Oh that's all right.

93
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,333
That's correct, sir.

94
00:11:31,334 --> 00:11:36,888
The first shot came to me in my room,
came to my ears, I mean, sir.

95
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:39,111
Then when I got to the door here...

96
00:11:39,112 --> 00:11:42,555
You're quite sure that three minutes elapsed
between the two shots?

97
00:11:42,556 --> 00:11:45,666
Something like that.
Yes sir.

98
00:11:45,667 --> 00:11:48,555
All right.
All right.

99
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:51,390
Must have been two burglars.

100
00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:56,111
Don't let me catch any of you trying
to leave the house, get that?

101
00:11:56,112 --> 00:11:57,333
They don't know anything about this.

102
00:11:57,334 --> 00:12:01,000
Do you?
I told you, no!

103
00:12:01,001 --> 00:12:03,640
Ah, your room is just across
the hall there, isn't it?

104
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,678
Yes.

105
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:08,111
And yet you heard nothing?
No.

106
00:12:08,112 --> 00:12:11,666
Hmm.
How do you figure that?

107
00:12:11,667 --> 00:12:16,222
Mr. Greene was shot from the front,
and from the powder marks,

108
00:12:16,223 --> 00:12:18,444
at close range,
and yet he made no sound?

109
00:12:18,445 --> 00:12:19,555
That's right.

110
00:12:19,556 --> 00:12:22,666
You remember the expression
on his face, Sergeant?

111
00:12:22,667 --> 00:12:26,444
Why sure. He was flabbergasted.
Exactly.

112
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:29,444
Possibly because he knew the murderer,

113
00:12:29,445 --> 00:12:33,000
just as the murderer knew
his way about this house in the dark.

114
00:12:33,001 --> 00:12:38,666
Mr. Greene was probably so surprised
to see an acquaintance, let's say,

115
00:12:38,667 --> 00:12:43,222
suddenly point a gun at him,
that he was killed before he could recover.

116
00:12:43,223 --> 00:12:47,888
Say, I wonder if anybody
in this house owns a gun.

117
00:12:47,889 --> 00:12:51,222
Certainly. Suspects own everything
you want them to, don't they?

118
00:12:51,223 --> 00:12:54,000
Who owns a gun?
Well, I did but...

119
00:12:54,001 --> 00:12:55,666
What caliber?
32.

120
00:12:55,667 --> 00:13:00,666
We got these out of your brother and sister.
They're 32s.

121
00:13:00,667 --> 00:13:03,333
Are you accusing me of...
What did you do with that gun?

122
00:13:03,334 --> 00:13:05,666
I haven't got it.
It's gone.

123
00:13:05,667 --> 00:13:07,111
I looked for it after this happened.

124
00:13:07,112 --> 00:13:11,000
I knew you'd find I had one and
accuse me, but I couldn't find it.

125
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,666
Go look for the gun.
Yeah.

126
00:13:15,667 --> 00:13:19,000
And tell Miss Sibella Greene to come here.
They won't find anything.

127
00:13:19,001 --> 00:13:21,666
Oh, we're all going to be killed, I tell you.
And you can't stop it.

128
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:22,777
You can't do anything.
Rex!

129
00:13:22,778 --> 00:13:26,666
Keep out of this. You're always here,
nosing into our affairs.

130
00:13:26,667 --> 00:13:29,333
But I know why...
Sibella!

131
00:13:29,334 --> 00:13:33,666
With all her money, she'd make you a delightful
Mrs. Arthur Von Blon, wouldn't she, Doctor?

132
00:13:33,667 --> 00:13:37,222
But her money is not enough!
You want ours too!

133
00:13:37,223 --> 00:13:39,888
That's it! You did this!
You took my gun!

134
00:13:39,889 --> 00:13:42,444
Now Rex, you've said enough.
You knew I had a revolver.

135
00:13:42,445 --> 00:13:44,666
You remembered! You saw it
when we went camping last summer!

136
00:13:44,667 --> 00:13:45,777
Now Rex.
You saw it and you took it!

137
00:13:45,778 --> 00:13:47,777
You stole it, you hear?
Give it back! Give it back...

138
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,777
You're the doctor the butler sent for.
Been wanting to talk to you.

139
00:14:03,778 --> 00:14:08,333
How long did it take you to get here
after you got this call?

140
00:14:08,334 --> 00:14:11,888
Ah, perhaps the doctor can tell us when
we may see the young lady who was shot.

141
00:14:11,888 --> 00:14:13,800
Why certainly.
I will let you know.

142
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:23,279
Miss Greene?
Right. You must be the detective.

143
00:14:24,929 --> 00:14:27,179
Quite a wild party we pulled here last night.

144
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:33,449
Miss Greene, do you know anyone who
would want to hurt your brother and sister?

145
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:37,000
Oh, we'd all come under suspicion there.
We all hate each other.

146
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:40,199
Rex thinks we're so beneath him mentally.

147
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,510
So of course we irritate him.
Oh, thanks.

148
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:48,150
Even little Ada.
She'd just love to see us all erased.

149
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:52,555
The only reason Mother hasn't killed the
whole family is that she can't move.

150
00:14:52,556 --> 00:14:54,555
Hip hip!

151
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,555
I've often thought of murdering us all myself.

152
00:14:57,556 --> 00:15:00,444
Only I couldn't think of any way
that would be thorough enough.

153
00:15:00,445 --> 00:15:03,178
Hooray.

154
00:15:03,179 --> 00:15:05,555
You may see Miss Ada now,
if you like.

155
00:15:05,556 --> 00:15:09,444
But please, no excitement.
Thank you.

156
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,630
I'll see you later.

157
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,666
Why not?

158
00:15:21,555 --> 00:15:23,444
Arthur?
Yes?

159
00:15:23,445 --> 00:15:29,222
Of course, after what's happened,
we better wait.

160
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,160
Yes, yes you are right.

161
00:15:33,539 --> 00:15:36,000
It would be too soon, now.

162
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:39,222
I heard the shot.
That's what woke me.

163
00:15:39,223 --> 00:15:42,888
But I thought it was an automobile
backfiring outside.

164
00:15:42,889 --> 00:15:48,666
And I was just getting to sleep again
when there was a shuffling noise.

165
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:50,777
And I got up...
Was the light on?

166
00:15:50,778 --> 00:15:56,111
No. I started to turn it on,
when a hand touched me.

167
00:15:56,112 --> 00:15:58,777
Oh, I tried to scream,
but I couldn't.

168
00:15:59,778 --> 00:16:04,111
Then there was that awful
shuffling sound again.

169
00:16:04,112 --> 00:16:09,480
And I ran. And then there was
a noise, and something hot hit me.

170
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,139
Oh, I can't remember anything more.

171
00:16:13,619 --> 00:16:17,639
Ah, just what do you mean
by shuffling sound, Miss Greene?

172
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:24,555
I don't know. Like sliding footsteps.
A man's or a woman's?

173
00:16:24,556 --> 00:16:27,222
Go on, say it was I.
You'd like to!

174
00:16:27,223 --> 00:16:29,444
Haven't you nerve enough to lie?
Sibella!

175
00:16:30,445 --> 00:16:33,222
You angelic little snake in the grass.

176
00:16:33,223 --> 00:16:35,308
I wouldn't be surprised
if you murdered Chester!

177
00:16:35,309 --> 00:16:38,489
Yeah, and probably shot herself
in the back too!

178
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:42,000
Sibella, why do you hate me so?

179
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,111
What have I ever done to...
Oh look at you!

180
00:16:44,112 --> 00:16:47,888
Everything. You've always wanted...
Sibella!

181
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,555
I'm sorry.

182
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,020
All right, Miss Greene.

183
00:17:03,419 --> 00:17:09,509
Let's you and I go out on the balcony and
examine those footprints and get some air.

184
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:16,229
Oh dear, here, I'll give you something
that will make you sleep.

185
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:25,777
Now, after shooting the girl,
he came out here. See?

186
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:33,360
He beat it down these steps,
and ducked.

187
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,790
The burglar?

188
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,750
Well, maybe it wasn't a burglar!

189
00:17:40,751 --> 00:17:44,000
Oh Simpkin, did you get
those footprints measured yet?

190
00:17:44,001 --> 00:17:45,777
All set.
Fine.

191
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:49,222
Trouble is, they disappear
when they hit the walk!

192
00:17:49,223 --> 00:17:52,499
And it stopped snowing
about 11 last night.

193
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,888
So it's impossible to know whether they
were made after the murder or before.

194
00:17:55,889 --> 00:17:59,111
That ain't all. The marker soles were
made by rubbers, probably galoshes.

195
00:17:59,112 --> 00:18:02,671
So we can't tell how much bigger
they are than the guy's feet!

196
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:04,444
Can't find any gun.
Where'd you look?

197
00:18:04,445 --> 00:18:06,991
Everywhere.
The old lady said to stay out of the library.

198
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:09,666
Says there hasn't been anybody in there
since her husband died.

199
00:18:09,667 --> 00:18:12,666
But the nurse showed me where the
key was, so I got in okay.

200
00:18:12,667 --> 00:18:14,777
Anything there?
Nothing but the creeps!

201
00:18:14,778 --> 00:18:16,333
I never been in such a house!

202
00:18:16,334 --> 00:18:18,666
You see any galoshes?
No.

203
00:18:18,667 --> 00:18:22,666
Well, go find some galoshes that will fit these.
Yes sir.

204
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,888
Mrs. Greene would like to see you,
officer.

205
00:18:27,889 --> 00:18:30,333
Sergeant!
Ah, Sergeant.

206
00:18:30,334 --> 00:18:33,444
And I wouldn't come down
on Rex too hard.

207
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:36,444
His accusing me is
merely self-protective.

208
00:18:36,445 --> 00:18:39,555
The result of your question
about his revolver, of course.

209
00:18:39,556 --> 00:18:43,000
If there's anything I can do,
glad to be of help.

210
00:18:43,001 --> 00:18:45,777
Thanks.
Is Miss Ada badly hurt?

211
00:18:45,778 --> 00:18:48,555
Oh, no, no, no.
Merely the shock.

212
00:18:48,556 --> 00:18:51,666
I gave her something...
Yes, I noticed your case, Doctor.

213
00:18:51,667 --> 00:18:54,555
You must have been trained abroad
to carry so many drugs.

214
00:18:54,556 --> 00:18:56,333
American doctors don't, you know.

215
00:18:56,334 --> 00:18:58,777
You are observant.
Thank you.

216
00:18:58,778 --> 00:19:01,666
You've known the Greenes a long while,
haven't you?

217
00:19:01,667 --> 00:19:06,100
My father attended them before me, so naturally.
Naturally.

218
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:12,333
Don't forget Mrs. Greene, Sergeant,
and remember, no excitement please.

219
00:19:12,334 --> 00:19:14,555
Oh yeah?
Yes.

220
00:19:14,556 --> 00:19:20,777
What kind of paralysis is Mrs. Greene's?
Organic, both legs. It's quite hopeless.

221
00:19:20,778 --> 00:19:23,000
Good morning.
- Good morning.

222
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:40,300
Oh, but Mother...
Be quiet!

223
00:19:40,301 --> 00:19:42,555
I've sent for the policeman.
Make them get out!

224
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,222
What right do they have
to come into this house?

225
00:19:44,223 --> 00:19:47,222
Officer, I command that you
drop this investigation.

226
00:19:47,223 --> 00:19:50,222
I've got worry and trouble enough
without this publicity.

227
00:19:50,223 --> 00:19:52,333
But madam uh...
Getting up close,

228
00:19:52,334 --> 00:19:58,439
Chester got what he deserved.
I'm a poor helpless old woman.

229
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,222
But if you keep on torturing me...

230
00:20:01,223 --> 00:20:04,555
Why haven't you spoken to me
about this affair?

231
00:20:04,556 --> 00:20:07,222
But that's exactly what the
Sergeant wants to do, Mrs. Greene.

232
00:20:07,223 --> 00:20:12,333
For example, whether you heard anything
last night before the shot.

233
00:20:12,334 --> 00:20:14,444
No.

234
00:20:14,445 --> 00:20:21,000
Now Miss Ada there heard a shuffling sound.
Oh, she did?

235
00:20:21,001 --> 00:20:25,222
Oh, that reminds me.
I did hear something.

236
00:20:25,223 --> 00:20:30,111
A door blowing back and forth in the hall.
Then why didn't you hear the shot?

237
00:20:30,112 --> 00:20:32,444
Well, it must have been
before the shooting

238
00:20:32,445 --> 00:20:35,333
because I got up and shut my door
and went back to sleep.

239
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:38,222
That door blowing must have been
what Ada heard.

240
00:20:38,223 --> 00:20:41,000
If you please, sir.
Miss Ada.

241
00:20:42,888 --> 00:20:48,580
Eh, good morning.
Good bye.

242
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,888
I remember now.

243
00:20:50,889 --> 00:20:55,409
I heard that noise Rex just
told you about, like a door closing.

244
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:57,555
Oh Sergeant.
Just a minute.

245
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:58,800
Pardon me.

246
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,000
Uh, but Miss Ada,

247
00:21:01,001 --> 00:21:06,222
Rex says that he heard the
closing of a door before the shot.

248
00:21:07,223 --> 00:21:11,759
No, why he couldn't have!
Mr. Vance.

249
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,222
Well, don't let it worry you.
Everybody's upset.

250
00:21:18,223 --> 00:21:20,159
Thank you.

251
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:33,000
[German]

252
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,070
Get a load of that.

253
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:50,550
I guess they'd make that
shuffling sound all right.

254
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,070
If I could just find that...

255
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:00,555
Are those your galoshes?
Well, what of it?

256
00:22:00,556 --> 00:22:03,111
I wasn't out of the house last night,
but I'm getting out.

257
00:22:03,112 --> 00:22:04,333
No you're not!

258
00:22:04,334 --> 00:22:06,333
If anyone's after us,
he'll get me, won't he?

259
00:22:06,334 --> 00:22:07,777
Do you think I want to be murdered too?

260
00:22:07,778 --> 00:22:09,888
Do you think I want to stay here...
You bet you are!

261
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,666
Watch this baby.

262
00:22:12,667 --> 00:22:16,666
Watch till you rot
and see where that will get you.

263
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:26,190
Do you like this family?

264
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:37,444
Sure it's funny, and so is a chicken crossing
the road! But nobody's ever solved that yet!

265
00:22:37,445 --> 00:22:42,333
I've had my boys hanging around that
place for a week checking on everything.

266
00:22:42,334 --> 00:22:43,555
And where are we?

267
00:22:43,556 --> 00:22:47,555
If it was a burglar, it would be a cinch.
But it wasn't.

268
00:22:47,556 --> 00:22:52,000
A burglar simply wouldn't have turned on Ada's
light after he shot her, now would he?

269
00:22:52,001 --> 00:22:53,444
Well, who was it then?

270
00:22:53,445 --> 00:22:57,222
Well, the psychological pattern...
My dear Vance,

271
00:22:57,223 --> 00:22:59,444
I'm afraid you're not going to get very far

272
00:22:59,445 --> 00:23:03,111
delving into what you call the
psychological patterns of the Greenes.

273
00:23:03,112 --> 00:23:06,888
My dear Markham, I'm afraid that the
only way you're going to find this murderer.

274
00:23:06,889 --> 00:23:13,444
These shootings were thought out, planned,
timed, by someone familiar with the family.

275
00:23:13,445 --> 00:23:16,555
Someone who lay in wait,
knew when everyone was asleep,

276
00:23:16,556 --> 00:23:19,444
knew just how and when to strike.

277
00:23:19,445 --> 00:23:22,444
That family...
...is nutty, if you ask me.

278
00:23:22,445 --> 00:23:25,777
A young lady to see you, sir.
A Miss Greene.

279
00:23:25,778 --> 00:23:29,888
Miss Greene?
Probably Sibella, the older sister.

280
00:23:29,889 --> 00:23:31,777
Have her come in.
Yes sir.

281
00:23:31,778 --> 00:23:35,333
She's probably found that gat
in her younger sister's stocking!

282
00:23:37,222 --> 00:23:43,111
Oh, how do you do? This is Miss Greene,
Miss Ada Greene. The district attorney.

283
00:23:43,112 --> 00:23:46,111
How do you do, Miss Greene?
I'm glad to see you're so much better.

284
00:23:46,112 --> 00:23:49,111
Oh, I'm quite all right now. Thank you.
Won't you sit down please?

285
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:56,666
There's something I want to tell you.
It's about Rex.

286
00:23:56,667 --> 00:23:59,222
You see, I uh...
Yes, well...

287
00:23:59,223 --> 00:24:06,888
Well, the night Chester was killed,
our lawyer was checking on Father's will.

288
00:24:06,889 --> 00:24:09,888
You must have heard of the Greene will.
Oh yes.

289
00:24:09,889 --> 00:24:16,555
Well, after the lawyer left, I saw Rex
take his galoshes out of that closet.

290
00:24:16,556 --> 00:24:20,555
How's that?
Oh, he can explain, I'm sure.

291
00:24:20,556 --> 00:24:23,777
Ah, pardon me just a moment. Gordon?
Yes sir.

292
00:24:23,778 --> 00:24:26,333
Get Mr. Rex Greene on the phone please.
Yes sir.

293
00:24:26,334 --> 00:24:29,333
Continue.
Well, then there was another thing.

294
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:31,333
Last night...
Yes?

295
00:24:31,334 --> 00:24:37,333
Well, last night I heard Dr. Von Blon tell
Sibella something about Mother's illness.

296
00:24:37,334 --> 00:24:41,444
I didn't understand it.
It was a medical term, I guess.

297
00:24:41,445 --> 00:24:44,555
But I wrote the word down
on a piece of paper.

298
00:24:44,556 --> 00:24:46,444
I thought probably, you'd know.

299
00:24:46,445 --> 00:24:48,666
May we see that piece of paper,
Miss Greene?

300
00:24:48,667 --> 00:24:51,333
Oh, I'm awfully sorry.

301
00:24:51,334 --> 00:24:54,222
It's at home, but I'll get it for...
...Ah, just a moment please.

302
00:24:54,223 --> 00:24:56,777
Mr. Rex Greene is on the phone
now, Mr. Markham.

303
00:24:56,778 --> 00:24:57,444
Thank you, Gordon.

304
00:24:57,445 --> 00:25:00,111
Say chief, maybe he could bring
that piece of paper down to us.

305
00:25:00,112 --> 00:25:03,444
Oh well then, perhaps you'd better
let me speak to Rex first.

306
00:25:03,445 --> 00:25:06,222
He resents strangers so.
Why surely.

307
00:25:07,666 --> 00:25:10,666
Rex dear.
Wait.

308
00:25:10,667 --> 00:25:15,000
There's an envelope in our
private mailbox, you know?

309
00:25:15,001 --> 00:25:16,666
Yes.

310
00:25:16,667 --> 00:25:19,555
Well, get it and read it to me,
will you please?

311
00:25:19,556 --> 00:25:23,444
I want to tell Mr. Markham.
Oh, all right.

312
00:25:31,601 --> 00:25:34,888
Rex! Rex!
Let me have it. Let me have it please.

313
00:25:34,889 --> 00:25:40,444
Hello?
Hello, hello Mr. Greene?

314
00:25:40,445 --> 00:25:41,333
Mr. Green!

315
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,555
Mr. Greene is dead.
He's dead.

316
00:25:51,555 --> 00:25:56,555
Ohh!
Gordon! Get my car.

317
00:25:56,556 --> 00:26:01,222
Take it easy.
It's all right.

318
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,777
Here comes the DA's car now.

319
00:26:14,222 --> 00:26:18,111
You'd better stand by,
for a few minutes, Buck,  anyhow.

320
00:26:20,444 --> 00:26:22,333
Hello boys.
Hello Sergeant.

321
00:26:22,334 --> 00:26:23,222
Now wait a minute.

322
00:26:23,223 --> 00:26:25,777
I tell you, we're not ready
to give you any story yet.

323
00:26:25,778 --> 00:26:27,333
We're not sure what is ourselves.

324
00:26:27,334 --> 00:26:31,000
No, I said I'm not ready
to give you a story.

325
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,710
He was shot from the front too.

326
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:55,333
But Chester was horrified.
This boy's face shows nothing.

327
00:26:55,334 --> 00:27:00,555
If Dr. Von Blon can be of any help,
sir, he asked me to tell you...

328
00:27:00,556 --> 00:27:02,888
Oh, the doctor was here
this time too, eh?

329
00:27:02,889 --> 00:27:04,333
Yes sir.
Get him.

330
00:27:04,334 --> 00:27:07,777
And Sproot, let's have
another go at the servants.

331
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,333
You see, Sergeant,

332
00:27:11,334 --> 00:27:15,555
the murderer and his weapon
couldn't have been invisible.

333
00:27:16,556 --> 00:27:19,444
But this boy's expression is natural.

334
00:27:19,445 --> 00:27:24,555
The look on his brother's face was...
...well to say the least, surprised.

335
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,888
It's all wrong, Markham.
It's mad.

336
00:27:27,889 --> 00:27:30,444
And I have a feeling
that if we don't stop it,

337
00:27:30,445 --> 00:27:35,000
it will go on and...
Oh, how do you do, Doctor?

338
00:27:35,444 --> 00:27:39,222
This is the district attorney.
Dr. Von Blon.

339
00:27:39,223 --> 00:27:40,444
How do you do, Doctor?

340
00:27:40,445 --> 00:27:43,111
You were here in the house
when this happened?

341
00:27:43,112 --> 00:27:46,333
Yes, yes.
I was in Miss Sibella's room.

342
00:27:46,334 --> 00:27:49,888
She was complaining of...
Well that doesn't matter, Doctor.

343
00:27:49,889 --> 00:27:53,666
Neither of you heard this shot?
That is correct.

344
00:27:53,667 --> 00:27:56,555
Although I can't quite make it out.

345
00:27:56,556 --> 00:27:58,666
The door was open
when Sproot found him.

346
00:27:58,667 --> 00:28:01,333
Oh, Sproot was first on the scene
this time too, eh?

347
00:28:01,334 --> 00:28:03,444
Yes, yes.
I see.

348
00:28:03,445 --> 00:28:04,444
Well, thank you Doctor.

349
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,888
Say, the police doc is coming up.

350
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:11,111
Don't forget,

351
00:28:11,112 --> 00:28:15,222
Ada told Rex to get that note
and read it to her over the phone.

352
00:28:15,223 --> 00:28:17,555
There's no sign of a note
on him now.

353
00:28:17,556 --> 00:28:21,000
Somebody must...
.. Nobody knew he was coming to see me.

354
00:28:21,001 --> 00:28:23,777
The servants are waiting
in the drawing room, sir.

355
00:28:23,778 --> 00:28:25,888
Thank you.
How many telephone extensions in this house?

356
00:28:25,889 --> 00:28:28,666
Telephones?
Four.

357
00:28:28,667 --> 00:28:33,000
One in Mrs. Greene's room,
Miss Sibella's room, the kitchen,

358
00:28:33,001 --> 00:28:35,222
and the hall here.
Thank you, Sproot.

359
00:28:36,223 --> 00:28:38,444
You see, anybody might
have listened in.

360
00:28:38,445 --> 00:28:39,666
How are you, Mr. Markham?

361
00:28:39,667 --> 00:28:41,000
Hello Doctor, how are you?
Sergeant.

362
00:28:41,001 --> 00:28:41,777
Hi ya, Doc.

363
00:28:41,778 --> 00:28:45,111
Well, when it's not my breakfast you
fellows interfere with, it's my lunch.

364
00:28:45,112 --> 00:28:48,000
I presume this is the body.

365
00:28:48,001 --> 00:28:52,222
Yeah, you get me that bullet
and then you can eat.

366
00:28:52,223 --> 00:28:54,777
Till the next bullet.

367
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,649
Come in.

368
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,555
Oh, hello.
I beg your pardon.

369
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:22,444
This thing is getting rather ghastly,
isn't it?

370
00:29:22,445 --> 00:29:26,000
You're taking it a bit more
seriously today, um?

371
00:29:26,001 --> 00:29:28,222
I'm beginning to wonder
if I won't be the next.

372
00:29:28,223 --> 00:29:32,111
But I know who you are now, Mr. Vance.
I remember the Canary case.

373
00:29:32,112 --> 00:29:35,888
So I suppose if anyone can help it, you can.
Thank you.

374
00:29:35,889 --> 00:29:38,777
Ah, the doctor says
you didn't hear the shot.

375
00:29:38,778 --> 00:29:43,222
No, I was in there giving Pompom -
that's my little dog there - a bath.

376
00:29:43,223 --> 00:29:46,111
Dr. Von Blon was sitting there smoking.

377
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:50,000
Mother hates the smell of pipe, so
he often comes in here for a smoke.

378
00:29:50,001 --> 00:29:52,409
And then Sproot called us.

379
00:29:52,409 --> 00:29:55,289
Ah, isn't it curious that
no one heard the shot?

380
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:56,340
But someone did.

381
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,849
Didn't he tell you?
Who?

382
00:29:58,849 --> 00:30:00,604
Sproot. Why, he told me...

383
00:30:00,604 --> 00:30:02,652
Chief's waiting for you down
in the parlor, Mr. Vance.

384
00:30:02,652 --> 00:30:06,510
Ah, quite right.
Ah, thank you.

385
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:17,334
Oh Arthur, I'm frightened!
What? No no, please. No, darling.

386
00:30:17,334 --> 00:30:21,371
I wish we could talk alone.
Yes, but where?

387
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:24,307
I know!
Where?

388
00:30:24,307 --> 00:30:25,375
On the roof!

389
00:30:25,375 --> 00:30:26,920
Good.
I'll get my coat.

390
00:30:52,619 --> 00:30:54,685
So now sir,
I know there's something funny.

391
00:30:54,685 --> 00:30:56,819
Mr. Chester was nice to me,
but the others...

392
00:30:57,149 --> 00:30:58,629
This family is queer, sir.

393
00:30:58,629 --> 00:31:01,611
Mrs. Greene is an old witch,
the way she keeps after Miss Ada.

394
00:31:01,611 --> 00:31:04,682
Though Miss Ada's no saint
when she gets mad either.

395
00:31:04,682 --> 00:31:06,450
Miss Sibella is a regular icicle.

396
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:07,851
And this Dr. Von Blon...

397
00:31:07,851 --> 00:31:11,054
...there's something between
Sibella and him, or I'm crazy.

398
00:31:11,054 --> 00:31:13,223
Sproot and Hemming...
they're as bad as the rest.

399
00:31:13,223 --> 00:31:15,225
And the cook too,
going around crying

400
00:31:15,225 --> 00:31:17,494
and talking to herself
in German all the time.

401
00:31:17,494 --> 00:31:20,364
You give me my pay, Mr. Sproot.
I'm through!

402
00:31:20,364 --> 00:31:21,450
That'll be all.

403
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:24,240
Oh Sproot.

404
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,838
Why didn't you tell us
you heard this last shot?

405
00:31:27,838 --> 00:31:31,708
No one asked me, sir.
Oh.

406
00:31:31,708 --> 00:31:33,043
Where were you when you heard it?

407
00:31:33,043 --> 00:31:35,412
I'd just called Mr. Rex to the telephone.

408
00:31:35,412 --> 00:31:38,682
Which phone did he use?
The one in the upper hall.

409
00:31:38,682 --> 00:31:42,955
I was in the dining room replacing the
silver when I heard the shot.

410
00:31:42,955 --> 00:31:45,655
Ah, Mr. Rex's room,
where you found him,

411
00:31:45,655 --> 00:31:48,925
is over the dining room, isn't it?
Over this room, sir.

412
00:31:48,925 --> 00:31:52,169
Well, whose room is over the dining room?
Miss Ada's.

413
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:55,230
Miss Ada was not in the house.
No.

414
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:58,440
That all, Sproot.

415
00:31:59,369 --> 00:32:02,639
Ah, Mrs. Mannheim, how long
have you been with the Greenes?

416
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:07,410
Thirteen years, since my husband died.
Old Mr. Greene knew my husband.

417
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,110
Were you in this country when he died?
Yes.

418
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:12,549
Well, that will be all.
Thank you.

419
00:32:13,517 --> 00:32:19,557
Hey Vance, what connection has
that last question with this case?

420
00:32:19,557 --> 00:32:21,425
Possibly none.

421
00:32:21,425 --> 00:32:25,130
On the other hand,
if we can relate these various facts,

422
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:28,832
and to get the psychology back of them...
Yes, if I could find that gun,

423
00:32:28,832 --> 00:32:33,537
I'd report all these shootings as suicides,
and resign from the force!

424
00:32:33,537 --> 00:32:35,430
Not a bad idea, Sergeant!

425
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:38,526
Interesting character, old Greene.

426
00:32:38,526 --> 00:32:41,280
I've been reading about him in the newspaper files.

427
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,173
True enough, though.

428
00:32:44,173 --> 00:32:46,717
We'd better have a copy
of the old boys will, Sergeant.

429
00:32:46,717 --> 00:32:50,950
Well, I can dig that up anyhow.
Well, that'll be something.

430
00:32:50,951 --> 00:32:52,823
Mr. Markham?
Yes.

431
00:32:52,823 --> 00:32:54,089
Someone's been in my room.

432
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:56,285
Say, I've got news for you.
Wait a minute.

433
00:32:56,285 --> 00:32:59,529
Who's been in your room?
Well, I was with Mother,

434
00:32:59,529 --> 00:33:02,879
and when I went back to my room,
the doors to the balcony were open

435
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,568
and there where mud tracks
across the rug.

436
00:33:04,568 --> 00:33:06,310
Those are the tracks I got!

437
00:33:06,311 --> 00:33:09,206
Somebody went from the front walk
across the mud in the yard

438
00:33:09,206 --> 00:33:11,842
and up those steps to the balcony
outside her room.

439
00:33:11,842 --> 00:33:13,310
And within a couple of hours,

440
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:16,146
because there were no tracks there
when I made the rounds this morning.

441
00:33:16,146 --> 00:33:21,084
And what's more, these prints are the same
as the ones we found last week in the snow,

442
00:33:21,084 --> 00:33:23,053
but they're no tracks coming down.

443
00:33:23,053 --> 00:33:25,255
The guy that made them
didn't come down that way.

444
00:33:25,255 --> 00:33:30,427
So he went up those balcony steps,
crossed Miss Ada's room to the hall,

445
00:33:30,427 --> 00:33:32,896
did his dirty work,
and vanished.

446
00:33:33,263 --> 00:33:36,832
You better come with us, Miss Ada.
Yes, of course.

447
00:33:36,832 --> 00:33:38,535
Come on, Simpkin.

448
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:42,205
Well, how could anyone
come up the balcony

449
00:33:42,205 --> 00:33:45,108
and get into her room
and get out again without being seen?

450
00:33:45,108 --> 00:33:48,030
Perhaps he didn't get out again.
You mean...?

451
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:51,148
Suppose you have dinner with me tonight,
Markham, in my apartment.

452
00:33:51,148 --> 00:33:54,418
By then, I may have something.
I hope so.

453
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,096
Oh Mr. Markham,

454
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:03,193
here's your bullet.
32 caliber again, you see?

455
00:34:03,193 --> 00:34:05,929
Looks like all three of them
were shot from the same gun.

456
00:34:05,929 --> 00:34:09,166
Anyway, I'll have the autopsy after lunch.
Very well.

457
00:34:09,166 --> 00:34:10,767
Mr. Vance?

458
00:34:13,403 --> 00:34:15,706
We measured those new footprints.

459
00:34:15,706 --> 00:34:17,274
And they're all from
the same galoshes all right,

460
00:34:17,274 --> 00:34:20,544
but now the galoshes are gone.
How did that happen?

461
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:22,746
Well, I put them back
in the closet the other day

462
00:34:22,746 --> 00:34:25,248
expecting to catch the guy
if he came back for them again.

463
00:34:25,248 --> 00:34:28,752
He must have copped them right from out
from under our noses.

464
00:34:28,752 --> 00:34:32,956
Well, I wouldn't put too much stock in those
footprints if I were you, Sergeant.

465
00:34:32,956 --> 00:34:38,140
I rather feel they are the only childish move
this clever murderer has made.

466
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,940
Well, we gotta have something to go on, ain't we?

467
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,330
Oh Miss Ada...

468
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:53,543
Well, it's nothing important.
Oh, I'm so nervous.

469
00:34:53,543 --> 00:34:55,178
Yes, naturally.

470
00:34:55,178 --> 00:34:57,314
When you spoke to Rex
from Mr. Markham's office

471
00:34:57,314 --> 00:34:59,182
about the note you wanted
him to read to you,

472
00:34:59,182 --> 00:35:01,830
you told him it was
in your private mailbox.

473
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,086
Oh that.

474
00:35:03,086 --> 00:35:06,900
Oh, that's right here in Rex's room.
I'll get it for you.

475
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:15,566
That's what we called
this incense burner.

476
00:35:15,566 --> 00:35:19,069
You see, we used to leave notes in it
for each other when we were children.

477
00:35:19,069 --> 00:35:21,840
We called it our private mailbox.

478
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,580
Ah, you put the envelope here.

479
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:28,845
Yes, and when you brought me back,
I looked for it, but it was gone.

480
00:35:28,845 --> 00:35:31,560
Rex must have taken it.

481
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,850
No, he didn't have it.

482
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:36,330
Well then, somebody must have...

483
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:38,855
Ah, can't you remember what it was
you wrote on that piece of paper?

484
00:35:38,855 --> 00:35:43,019
You told us it was a medical
term about your mother.

485
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,995
Perhaps Dr. Von Blon could tell you.

486
00:35:44,995 --> 00:35:48,131
He's up on the roof garden with Sibella
if you care to ask him.

487
00:35:48,131 --> 00:35:49,633
Oh, uh...

488
00:35:49,633 --> 00:35:52,108
Oh, the stairs are right
behind that door there.

489
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:54,705
I see.
Thank you.

490
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:10,388
I ah...
I beg your pardon.

491
00:36:10,388 --> 00:36:15,325
I meant to ask you, Doctor,
have you by chance thought it advisable

492
00:36:15,325 --> 00:36:19,296
to withhold any phase of Mrs. Greene's 
illness from the family?

493
00:36:19,296 --> 00:36:20,764
Why no.

494
00:36:20,764 --> 00:36:26,229
Mrs. Greene's illness is a very simple type
of paralysis of the legs, paraplegia.

495
00:36:26,229 --> 00:36:28,120
Oh, I see.
Oh, hello Arthur.

496
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:32,676
I just wanted to tell you, you left your
medicine case in Mother's room.

497
00:36:32,676 --> 00:36:34,710
Oh, yes. Oh, yes, thank you.

498
00:36:34,711 --> 00:36:36,945
It'd be a perfect spot for murder,
wouldn't it?

499
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:38,999
Why shoot anyone?
- when all you have to do

500
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,752
is take them to a roof guard
and push them over into the river.

501
00:36:41,752 --> 00:36:46,420
Just another accident, a suicide.
And no one the wiser.

502
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:50,018
You know, I think I'll take up
crime in a serious way.

503
00:36:50,018 --> 00:36:52,162
Oh, stop it!

504
00:36:52,162 --> 00:36:54,510
Oh Arthur please,
let's go down from here.

505
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:14,214
Would it be right, Vance, if Rex's
murderer did not leave the house,

506
00:37:14,214 --> 00:37:16,320
it's someone we've been talking to?

507
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:24,640
By the way, Sergeant,
did you dig up old Greene's will?

508
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:28,260
Yes, I have a copy of it here. 
Get it, will you please?

509
00:37:30,834 --> 00:37:35,645
Dr. Von Blon.
Well.

510
00:37:37,474 --> 00:37:39,701
Uh, show him in.

511
00:37:42,579 --> 00:37:44,848
How do you do, Doctor?

512
00:37:44,848 --> 00:37:47,951
Coffee?
No, it's very kind of you.

513
00:37:47,951 --> 00:37:48,752
Won't you sit down?

514
00:37:48,752 --> 00:37:51,910
Thank you. 
I have something very important to tell you.

515
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:58,470
Some drugs, strychnine and morphine,
have been taken from my medicine case.

516
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:03,300
How much?
Four and eight grains.

517
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:07,337
I heard that they were missing
when I got home this afternoon.

518
00:38:07,337 --> 00:38:11,608
But the drugs were my case when I
made my usual call on Mrs. Greene.

519
00:38:11,608 --> 00:38:15,065
But you didn't keep your case
with you, did you doctor?

520
00:38:15,065 --> 00:38:17,909
I remember Ada saying
that you had left it...

521
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:19,710
Oh yes, yes.
I left it in the hall first.

522
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:23,040
And then Sproot brought
to me in to Miss Sibella's room.

523
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:28,492
Did you leave it alone there?
Why, uh, why yes.

524
00:38:28,492 --> 00:38:31,139
Early this morning.
Mrs. Greene needed a stimulant.

525
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:35,699
She was very weak. So I had the
nurse bring it into Mrs. Greene's room.

526
00:38:35,699 --> 00:38:37,862
So anybody might have
swiped the poison.

527
00:38:37,862 --> 00:38:40,637
I hope this is not going to turn out
to be a poisoning case.

528
00:38:40,637 --> 00:38:42,372
Well, there ain't any need
looking for the stuff!

529
00:38:42,372 --> 00:38:45,208
There's a thousand places in the house
where it could be hid.

530
00:38:45,208 --> 00:38:46,877
Say Chief,

531
00:38:46,877 --> 00:38:50,414
what do you think about replacing
Mrs. Greene's nurse with a police nurse?

532
00:38:50,414 --> 00:38:52,115
She can watch better than we can.

533
00:38:52,115 --> 00:38:55,285
Yes, that's very good, Officer...
uh, Sergeant.

534
00:38:55,285 --> 00:38:56,975
I have a concern there myself.

535
00:38:56,975 --> 00:38:59,970
Well, I'll put in the nurse
and I'll put in a doctor,

536
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:04,027
across the street where the men who
are watching from that apartment house.

537
00:39:04,027 --> 00:39:08,465
He'll be able to get there quick,
if anything should break.

538
00:39:08,465 --> 00:39:12,636
Thank you.
Good evening, Doctor.

539
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:22,620
This is one of the most carefully
worked-out plots I've ever known.

540
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,949
So logical, it's insane.

541
00:39:28,118 --> 00:39:30,487
Well, here's old Greene's will.

542
00:39:30,487 --> 00:39:33,757
Mr. Markham and I went through it.
Nothing that we didn't know before.

543
00:39:33,757 --> 00:39:38,850
Except for a few bequests to the servants,
Sproot, and Mrs. Mannheim,

544
00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:42,466
who receive an income for life,
whenever they retire.

545
00:39:42,466 --> 00:39:44,167
And we get the library.

546
00:39:44,167 --> 00:39:46,770
Why do you suppose
that old bird did that?

547
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:49,473
Well, I remember, the newspapers printed
a story about it at the time.

548
00:39:49,473 --> 00:39:52,642
Here it is here.

549
00:39:52,642 --> 00:39:57,147
At the expiration of 15 years, the library
goes to New York Police Department.

550
00:39:57,147 --> 00:40:02,619
As for the rest of it, those still
living benefit equally from the murders.

551
00:40:02,619 --> 00:40:06,189
And there's three of the family still left.

552
00:40:06,189 --> 00:40:12,479
And two from three leaves one.
Strychnine and morphine.

553
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,304
Well, not if I can help it!

554
00:40:14,304 --> 00:40:16,666
I'll have that doctor
and nurse there in half an hour.

555
00:40:16,666 --> 00:40:20,970
Why should old Tobias Greene
leave his books to the police?

556
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:25,275
I think we'd better look
into that library, Markham.

557
00:40:25,275 --> 00:40:26,260
Right.

558
00:40:36,687 --> 00:40:38,755
Anything new?
No sir.

559
00:40:38,755 --> 00:40:41,458
Everybody's in their room
but the Sibella girl.

560
00:40:41,458 --> 00:40:44,027
She's out riding
with this Dr. Von Blon.

561
00:40:44,027 --> 00:40:47,731
Turns rather easily, to have been
locked so long, hmm?

562
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:50,901
Hinges smooth too.

563
00:40:50,901 --> 00:40:54,104
Did you oil this lock when you
opened the door last week?

564
00:40:54,104 --> 00:40:55,772
No.
And if you ask me,

565
00:40:55,772 --> 00:41:01,210
it's a lot of baloney about this thing
having been locked for 10 years.

566
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:06,883
Mac, where's the light switch?
Ah, it ain't a working,

567
00:41:06,883 --> 00:41:08,985
but you'll find some candles 
over there by the fireplace.

568
00:41:08,985 --> 00:41:11,788
Anybody ran into those galoshes yet?
No?

569
00:41:11,788 --> 00:41:13,757
But I've been looking all over
the house for them.

570
00:41:13,757 --> 00:41:15,559
Well keep after them.
You bet.

571
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:17,527
Oh Mac.
Yes sir.

572
00:41:17,527 --> 00:41:19,229
Before you go,
let me have your light.

573
00:41:19,229 --> 00:41:20,764
Yes sir.

574
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:26,610
Well, they haven't been
opened in a long time.

575
00:41:30,907 --> 00:41:34,144
What happened, Sergeant?
I tripped over something.

576
00:41:34,144 --> 00:41:35,545
What was it?
Uh...

577
00:41:38,682 --> 00:41:40,517
The galoshes!

578
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,320
Good work, Sergeant!

579
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:54,131
Apparently we've had
a frequent visitor here.

580
00:41:54,164 --> 00:41:55,999
Yes, and a recent one.

581
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,402
I've got it!

582
00:41:58,402 --> 00:42:01,605
Somebody's been sitting
in this chair reading.

583
00:42:01,605 --> 00:42:04,090
Excellent, Sergeant.

584
00:42:04,941 --> 00:42:06,543
Now, let's see.

585
00:42:14,217 --> 00:42:21,391
Hmm, no wonder old Tobias
left his books to the police.

586
00:42:21,391 --> 00:42:22,459
How's that?

587
00:42:22,459 --> 00:42:29,740
A complete library of criminology,
in several languages, too.

588
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:31,860
Uh oh.

589
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,038
No dust on the shelf here.

590
00:42:35,038 --> 00:42:38,408
Apparently this is where our
bookworm has been nibbling.

591
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:42,179
A Complete History of Crime,
by Thack.

592
00:42:42,179 --> 00:42:43,613
That's a realm.

593
00:42:43,613 --> 00:42:46,917
Poisons That Affect the Detection.

594
00:42:46,917 --> 00:42:49,086
...That would stop her from sleep-walking.

595
00:42:49,086 --> 00:42:54,791
Say, Mrs. Greene!
The old lady, she can walk!

596
00:42:54,791 --> 00:42:59,096
And she read in that book where she can
lay it on to walking in her sleep
if she gets caught.

597
00:43:00,329 --> 00:43:01,649
But Dr. Von Blon told me...

598
00:43:02,966 --> 00:43:06,133
It's possible, Sergeant,
but I don't think it fits.

599
00:43:06,133 --> 00:43:11,408
What's that?
The door.

600
00:43:14,711 --> 00:43:19,286
Mr. Markham, I've got something
terrible to tell you.

601
00:43:19,286 --> 00:43:22,552
Oh, about an hour ago,
I was up in my room.

602
00:43:22,552 --> 00:43:26,423
I heard that shuffling noise.
It was going down the stairs there.

603
00:43:26,423 --> 00:43:28,980
Oh, I was sick I was so afraid!

604
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:32,162
But I forced myself to look
over the banister.

605
00:43:32,162 --> 00:43:35,766
And I saw someone standing in
front of the library door here.

606
00:43:35,766 --> 00:43:38,235
Who was it?
It was Mother!

607
00:43:38,235 --> 00:43:40,070
Mother?
She was walking!

608
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:42,039
Are you sure?

609
00:43:42,039 --> 00:43:45,120
Yes, she had on her
oriental shawl.

610
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:49,890
And when she stepped into the light,
I saw her face!

611
00:43:52,469 --> 00:43:55,221
Markham, we'd better have a specialist
examine Mrs. Green.

612
00:43:56,053 --> 00:43:57,988
Suppose you get Oppenheimer.
You know him.

613
00:43:57,988 --> 00:43:58,908
Then very well, I will.

614
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:02,459
Take it easy, little girl.
It's all right.

615
00:44:02,459 --> 00:44:04,961
I'll get the nurse.

616
00:44:45,635 --> 00:44:51,279
Mr. Vance?
Oh, good morning, Sergeant.

617
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:54,447
Well, I'm afraid I must have fallen...

618
00:44:58,315 --> 00:45:00,650
Well, what is it?
Ada!

619
00:45:02,386 --> 00:45:03,653
Ada?

620
00:45:07,257 --> 00:45:10,594
The poison, I suppose.
Yeah, the morphine.

621
00:45:10,594 --> 00:45:12,996
I laid down in the drawing room
for some sleep.

622
00:45:12,996 --> 00:45:14,264
And the first thing I knew,

623
00:45:14,264 --> 00:45:16,733
the doctor I had planted across
the street was shaking me.

624
00:45:16,733 --> 00:45:19,503
The nurse found the kid
and signaled him.

625
00:45:19,503 --> 00:45:23,573
She's not dead?
No, Doc got to her in time.

626
00:45:23,573 --> 00:45:27,444
Hmm, oh Von Blon
is here again, eh?

627
00:45:27,444 --> 00:45:29,613
The butler phoned him,
but he'd gone to his hospital.

628
00:45:29,613 --> 00:45:31,314
I left word I wanted him.

629
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:36,319
Of all the dumb luck, wait
till you see what gave the alarm.

630
00:45:40,323 --> 00:45:46,897
That's a girl. Now, steady. Steady.
How is she, Miss O'Brien?

631
00:45:46,897 --> 00:45:48,660
Oh, she's coming on fine.

632
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,600
Turn her over to the doctor
and you hop right back here.

633
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:58,175
The butler found her
when her bell rang downstairs.

634
00:45:58,175 --> 00:46:01,878
Miss Sibella's dog was on the bed,
with this in his mouth, playing with it.

635
00:46:01,878 --> 00:46:04,614
That's what saved the kid.
Can you beat it?

636
00:46:04,614 --> 00:46:09,028
Oh, Miss O'Brien, tell
Mr. Vance about the bullion.

637
00:46:09,029 --> 00:46:11,088
Why, Mrs. Greene sent me in
with the bullion,

638
00:46:11,088 --> 00:46:13,623
keeping a cup for herself
as she always did, she said.

639
00:46:13,623 --> 00:46:15,525
Uh, did Mrs. Greene
touch Ada's cup?

640
00:46:15,525 --> 00:46:18,495
No sir. I brought it up
from the kitchen myself.

641
00:46:18,495 --> 00:46:22,408
The young lady was in the
bathroom, so I set it down there.

642
00:46:22,409 --> 00:46:25,769
Then I told Miss Ada it was waiting,
and I went down to my breakfast.

643
00:46:25,769 --> 00:46:27,904
Then the butler hears her bell,
comes up,

644
00:46:27,904 --> 00:46:29,873
and finds her laying on the bed.

645
00:46:29,873 --> 00:46:33,900
Were all the others in their rooms?
Yes sir.

646
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:36,240
And Miss Sibella?

647
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:38,920
She got in at three this morning.
She's still asleep.

648
00:46:39,883 --> 00:46:42,819
Oh Miss O'Brien, when you
went to breakfast this morning,

649
00:46:42,819 --> 00:46:46,423
did you see Miss Sibella's dog?
No sir.

650
00:46:46,423 --> 00:46:48,810
That will be all.
Thank you.

651
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:59,419
The old lady jumped out of bed,
slipped the stuff in the cup there,

652
00:46:59,419 --> 00:47:02,105
and got back
while Ada was in the bathroom.

653
00:47:02,105 --> 00:47:03,607
Sproot has told me about Ada.

654
00:47:03,607 --> 00:47:06,343
Uh, how is Miss Sibella?
Asleep.

655
00:47:06,343 --> 00:47:07,978
Where were you?

656
00:47:07,978 --> 00:47:13,583
Why, I was in Connecticut in Greenwich
on a case. Didn't return until late.

657
00:47:13,583 --> 00:47:17,254
Uh, Sergeant, will you see if
Miss Ada can talk with us now?

658
00:47:17,254 --> 00:47:18,488
Sure.

659
00:47:18,488 --> 00:47:23,026
Ah Doctor, you won't object
if our police surgeon continues

660
00:47:23,026 --> 00:47:25,529
with Miss Ada's case, will you?
Certainly not.

661
00:47:25,529 --> 00:47:29,433
Was your diagnosis of Mrs. Greene's
case the only one that was made?

662
00:47:29,433 --> 00:47:30,400
I believe so.

663
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,235
I saw no reason to...
Of course not.

664
00:47:32,235 --> 00:47:34,871
But under the circumstances,
the police think

665
00:47:34,871 --> 00:47:38,241
they should have a more detailed report.
Naturally.

666
00:47:38,241 --> 00:47:41,006
So you won't mind
if we call in a specialist?

667
00:47:41,006 --> 00:47:43,547
If you wish.
Thank you.

668
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:49,620
We'll have to wait.
She's in no condition to talk.

669
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:52,731
We're getting warm, Sergeant.

670
00:47:52,731 --> 00:47:55,000
Our murderer will do anything
to stop us now.

671
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:57,390
So keep alive.

672
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:03,133
That's some job!...
in this house!

673
00:48:44,641 --> 00:48:46,109
Uh, information.

674
00:48:46,109 --> 00:48:51,014
Let me have the county clerk
at Greenwich, Connecticut, please.

675
00:49:01,525 --> 00:49:07,097
Oh Markham. What's up?
It's all over, Vance.

676
00:49:07,664 --> 00:49:09,232
You've got the
specialist's report, eh?

677
00:49:09,232 --> 00:49:12,790
There won't be any report.
Mrs. Greene is dead.

678
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:17,862
The strychnine, eh?
Yes.

679
00:49:17,862 --> 00:49:20,446
It was in the bicarb she takes
before going to bed.

680
00:49:20,446 --> 00:49:21,611
Suicide, of course.

681
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:26,368
She knew that we were on to her.
I don't know, Markham.

682
00:49:26,368 --> 00:49:28,756
That doesn't fit.
Oh nonsense.

683
00:49:28,756 --> 00:49:32,700
There's no psychology here.
The poor woman was mad.

684
00:49:34,350 --> 00:49:35,490
Thank heaven it's over.

685
00:49:37,770 --> 00:49:40,797
Markham, I still want an examination
of Mrs. Greene's leg muscles.

686
00:49:40,797 --> 00:49:44,301
What?
I'll be dressed in just a minute.

687
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:51,441
Oh Doctor?
Oh, evening, Chief.

688
00:49:51,441 --> 00:49:55,011
Say, don't this murderer of yours
know it's Saturday?

689
00:49:55,011 --> 00:49:58,048
I promised to take my kids
to the pictures this evening.

690
00:49:58,048 --> 00:50:01,351
Hey Doctor, I want you 
to make enough of an autopsy

691
00:50:01,351 --> 00:50:03,809
to make a report
on Mrs. Greene's leg muscles,

692
00:50:03,809 --> 00:50:05,288
whether she could have
walked or not.

693
00:50:05,288 --> 00:50:06,430
Understand?
Right.

694
00:50:06,569 --> 00:50:09,717
I am the resurrection and
the life, saith the Lord.

695
00:50:09,717 --> 00:50:13,397
The Lord gave and
the Lord hath taken away.

696
00:50:13,397 --> 00:50:16,566
Blessed be the name of the Lord.

697
00:50:18,568 --> 00:50:24,741
Worms destroy this body,
yet in my flesh shall I see God.

698
00:50:24,741 --> 00:50:27,711
Vanity of vanities.

699
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:31,581
The Lord has been busy again.

700
00:50:31,581 --> 00:50:35,852
I told you, all the wicked
shall be destroyed.

701
00:50:35,852 --> 00:50:37,356
What are you doing here?

702
00:50:37,356 --> 00:50:40,180
Cleaning out the corruption
of Tobias Greene.

703
00:50:40,739 --> 00:50:42,239
Hey, you turn that off!

704
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:48,999
Miss Sibella is doomed too.
I had a dream. The hussy!

705
00:50:48,999 --> 00:50:52,135
The way she's been carrying on
with Dr. Von Blon...

706
00:50:52,135 --> 00:50:55,140
Oh!
She'll be the next!

707
00:50:57,750 --> 00:51:01,478
Man that is born of a woman
hath but a short time to live

708
00:51:01,478 --> 00:51:03,447
and is very miserable.

709
00:51:03,447 --> 00:51:06,060
He cometh up,
and is cut down.

710
00:51:07,469 --> 00:51:10,580
What do you make of that?
Oh, she's just a cuckoo!

711
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:13,767
Old lady Greene did these killings!
Um uh.

712
00:51:13,767 --> 00:51:16,760
Mrs. Greene's leg muscles
are entirely wasted away.

713
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:18,528
Been that way for years.

714
00:51:18,528 --> 00:51:22,999
As for walking or even moving,
not a chance in the world.

715
00:51:22,999 --> 00:51:24,868
There you are, Sergeant.

716
00:51:24,868 --> 00:51:27,838
But Ada was certain that she saw
her mother at this door.

717
00:51:27,838 --> 00:51:32,109
Markham, I know
I'm on the right track now.

718
00:51:32,109 --> 00:51:37,547
And once I can put all the facts
together, I'll have a solution.

719
00:51:37,547 --> 00:51:39,275
You'll excuse me.
Thank you, Doctor.

720
00:51:39,275 --> 00:51:41,818
Keep up with me, Sergeant.
All right.

721
00:51:43,110 --> 00:51:45,389
[German]

722
00:51:45,389 --> 00:51:48,906
I'm sorry to bother you
again, Miss Ada.

723
00:51:48,906 --> 00:51:50,819
You're feeling better
this evening?

724
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:52,890
Yes, much better.
Thank you.

725
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:58,029
Now, you told us you saw your mother
walking in front of the library, didn't you?

726
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,130
Why, yes.

727
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,960
The medical examiner's autopsy show
that your mother couldn't walk.

728
00:52:06,029 --> 00:52:07,859
Why, I don't understand.

729
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:10,770
It must have been Mother.

730
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:14,490
Are you positive the person you saw
was wearing your Mother's shawl?

731
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:17,654
Yes.
That was the first thing I noticed.

732
00:52:17,654 --> 00:52:20,791
Oh,
she maybe saw me.

733
00:52:20,791 --> 00:52:23,220
Oh, don't be silly, Gertrude.

734
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:25,800
Oh, you have worn
Mrs. Greene's shawl?

735
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:28,410
Why, of course she hasn't.

736
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:32,610
Ah, who has worn the shawl besides your mother?

737
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:36,740
Why, I don't know.
Let me see...

738
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:40,799
Oh, it couldn't have been Sibella because...
Oh Sibella has worn it?

739
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:41,850
Why yes, she's often...

740
00:52:41,850 --> 00:52:45,750
Oh!
Oh, I didn't mean to say that.

741
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:48,930
I'll have to ask you to excuse me.

742
00:52:54,558 --> 00:52:58,640
Ah, Mrs. Mannheim,
you told me you, ah,

743
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:01,631
were in this country when your
husband died, didn't you?

744
00:53:01,631 --> 00:53:05,068
Where were you?
Trenton, New Jersey.

745
00:53:05,068 --> 00:53:08,372
My husband was working there.
I see.

746
00:53:08,372 --> 00:53:11,018
Did you notice anybody walking
around the house last night?

747
00:53:11,018 --> 00:53:15,178
With Mrs. Greene's oriental shawl on?
No sir.

748
00:53:15,178 --> 00:53:17,814
Sure?
Yes sir.

749
00:53:17,814 --> 00:53:21,585
Sergeant?
Oh, all right, Sproot.

750
00:53:22,350 --> 00:53:24,365
Will you phone that address

751
00:53:24,365 --> 00:53:26,690
and get me the record of that name?
Surely.

752
00:53:26,690 --> 00:53:29,493
Oh, Mr. Markham had to leave.
I see.

753
00:53:29,493 --> 00:53:31,909
And Sergeant,
when you make this call,

754
00:53:31,909 --> 00:53:35,432
will you cover all the extensions
so that no one can listen in?

755
00:53:35,432 --> 00:53:36,450
Surely.
Good.

756
00:53:44,850 --> 00:53:47,077
Oh, Sproot.
Yes sir?

757
00:53:47,077 --> 00:53:50,970
Do you know if any of the family
reads or speaks German?

758
00:53:50,970 --> 00:53:56,186
Ah yes sir. Old Mr. Greene
had all the children learn it.

759
00:53:56,186 --> 00:53:59,790
They spent so much time in Germany
when he was on business there.

760
00:53:59,790 --> 00:54:01,559
I see.

761
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:04,013
Now Sproot,
a particularly important question.

762
00:54:04,013 --> 00:54:07,497
You found Miss Ada after
she was shot, didn't you?

763
00:54:07,497 --> 00:54:10,567
Yes sir.
When you found her,

764
00:54:10,567 --> 00:54:13,603
was the window beyond
her dressing table open?

765
00:54:13,603 --> 00:54:15,305
Now please think carefully.

766
00:54:15,305 --> 00:54:19,230
The window that overlooks the
balcony steps. Was it open?

767
00:54:20,489 --> 00:54:23,339
Yes sir, I closed it.
Thank you, Sproot.

768
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:29,760
Oh Mrs. Mannheim,
if you please.

769
00:54:41,064 --> 00:54:43,380
All right. I'll wait.

770
00:54:47,504 --> 00:54:50,307
Ada, I told you to bring
Pompom back to me.

771
00:54:50,307 --> 00:54:52,542
I want to take her up
on the roof.

772
00:54:52,542 --> 00:54:57,082
Sibella, please let me go
to the roof garden with you.

773
00:54:57,082 --> 00:54:58,900
I'm afraid alone here.

774
00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:04,080
Let me help you.

775
00:55:07,230 --> 00:55:09,820
Take care of yourself, Miss Ada.
Thank you very much.

776
00:55:15,766 --> 00:55:17,601
Yeah...

777
00:55:20,871 --> 00:55:22,140
What? Wait...

778
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:24,090
Yeah...

779
00:55:30,450 --> 00:55:31,500
Okay...

780
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:41,158
Well, do you know
any reason, then,

781
00:55:41,158 --> 00:55:43,260
why the Greenes should be
attacked like this?

782
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:45,540
Believe me that
I don't know.

783
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:51,601
Mr. Chester and Mr. Rex maybe I could understand.

784
00:55:51,601 --> 00:56:02,012
They hated everybody.
But little Ada... [German]

785
00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:09,810
Got what you wanted
all right, Mr. Vance.

786
00:56:14,730 --> 00:56:15,780
Ah Mrs. Mannheim...

787
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:18,510
Suppose we have the truth.

788
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:22,466
You say your husband died
at Trenton 13 years ago.

789
00:56:22,466 --> 00:56:23,734
Yes.

790
00:56:23,734 --> 00:56:28,939
And it was just 13 years ago
that Mr. Greene adopted Ada.

791
00:56:28,939 --> 00:56:31,908
You know then?
Yes.

792
00:56:31,908 --> 00:56:34,709
I suspected for some time
that she is your daughter.

793
00:56:34,710 --> 00:56:38,181
I promised Mr. Greene
I wouldn't tell anybody.

794
00:56:38,181 --> 00:56:43,620
Not even Ada,
if he'd let me stay by her.

795
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:45,210
Why hasn't she recognized you?

796
00:56:45,330 --> 00:56:48,660
She was away to school
since she was five.

797
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:53,400
Mr. Greene brought her here.
Then I told him that...

798
00:56:54,989 --> 00:56:58,802
Yes? What?
Nothing! Nothing at all!

799
00:56:59,370 --> 00:57:02,239
You mean, when you told Mr.
Greene that your husband,

800
00:57:02,239 --> 00:57:05,942
who had helped him with some of
his questionable business deals,

801
00:57:05,942 --> 00:57:10,647
was dead at the New Jersey State
Hospital for the criminally insane.

802
00:57:16,286 --> 00:57:18,755
All right, Sergeant.

803
00:57:21,324 --> 00:57:23,593
Say, what's the matter?
I can handle that dame.

804
00:57:23,593 --> 00:57:25,470
Who?
Frau Mannheim.

805
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:27,130
The dope on her husband.

806
00:57:27,130 --> 00:57:30,213
Say, if it wasn't old lady Greene,
it's got to be the cook!

807
00:57:30,213 --> 00:57:32,129
She killed them to get
the money for her Ada.

808
00:57:32,130 --> 00:57:34,638
Nobody else could have.
But somebody else did though.

809
00:57:34,638 --> 00:57:38,275
Who? How? I can't pinch
somebody without evidence.

810
00:57:38,275 --> 00:57:42,412
Here it is. Exhibit A.
What do you mean?

811
00:57:42,412 --> 00:57:45,415
It's no wonder that we've been
confused, to say the least, Sergeant.

812
00:57:45,415 --> 00:57:47,818
The murderer copied
every detail of the crimes

813
00:57:47,818 --> 00:57:50,253
from these books,
from actual criminal history.

814
00:57:50,253 --> 00:57:51,983
The experience of hundreds of criminals,

815
00:57:51,983 --> 00:57:55,625
plus the science of the
world's greatest criminologists.

816
00:57:55,625 --> 00:57:58,762
Say, give me a break, will you?
Who is it?

817
00:57:58,762 --> 00:58:01,179
If you'll come with me to Rex's room,

818
00:58:01,179 --> 00:58:03,856
I think I can verify
how he was killed.

819
00:58:03,856 --> 00:58:05,560
Then I'll have everything.

820
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:14,311
You remember, Sergeant,
Rex fell here, close to the fireplace.

821
00:58:14,910 --> 00:58:17,114
We know from his expression
that he never saw the gun.

822
00:58:17,114 --> 00:58:18,382
That's right.

823
00:58:18,382 --> 00:58:21,300
He was about your height, Sergeant.

824
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:24,720
I wonder...
Secret panel stuff, eh?

825
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:30,193
They sometimes put safes
in these old mantles.

826
00:58:30,193 --> 00:58:32,362
Be careful, Sergeant.

827
00:58:33,897 --> 00:58:35,599
Well!

828
00:58:47,044 --> 00:58:51,348
There you are.
Rex's gun!

829
00:58:51,348 --> 00:58:53,884
Well, the old man-killing safe idea!
Just that.

830
00:58:53,884 --> 00:58:55,661
When Rex opened this panel,

831
00:58:55,661 --> 00:58:58,675
the string pulled trigger
and fired the gun.

832
00:58:58,675 --> 00:59:01,412
The whole idea came
right from that book,

833
00:59:01,412 --> 00:59:02,838
even to the bootjack.

834
00:59:02,838 --> 00:59:05,560
Will you hold that, Sergeant?
Thank you.

835
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:12,150
I thought so.
Straight through to the other room.

836
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:19,509
Say, everyone on this floor
was at the other end of the house.

837
00:59:19,509 --> 00:59:21,812
The sound went down the flue.

838
00:59:21,812 --> 00:59:24,081
That's why Sproot heard it
in the room below.

839
00:59:24,081 --> 00:59:24,948
Exactly.

840
00:59:26,683 --> 00:59:27,784
I have it!

841
00:59:27,784 --> 00:59:30,554
She listened in
on Rex's phone call,

842
00:59:30,554 --> 00:59:34,124
knew that he was going after a note
that would tip the whole thing off to us.

843
00:59:34,124 --> 00:59:36,193
She came in,
fixed the gun...

844
00:59:36,193 --> 00:59:38,428
Who?
Sibella!

845
00:59:38,428 --> 00:59:41,332
She was afraid Ada
would cop Dr. Von Blon.

846
00:59:41,332 --> 00:59:45,001
She read German, got the
dope out of these books.

847
00:59:45,001 --> 00:59:47,904
No, Sergeant,
not Sibella.

848
00:59:47,904 --> 00:59:50,910
Ada!
What?

849
00:59:52,469 --> 00:59:54,077
That's the private mailbox.

850
00:59:54,077 --> 00:59:56,646
When Ada spoke to Rex
from Markham's office,

851
00:59:56,646 --> 00:59:59,483
she sent him for a note
that never existed.

852
01:00:00,584 --> 01:00:04,955
And now that we've got that, Sergeant,
I think you can make your arrest.

853
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:06,990
Now wait a minute.

854
01:00:06,990 --> 01:00:09,848
Ada can wait.
She's on the roof.

855
01:00:09,848 --> 01:00:12,960
But I still don't get it.
Her motive?

856
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:17,010
First of all, jealousy, Sergeant.

857
01:00:17,010 --> 01:00:19,703
Jealousy of Sibella
over Dr. Von Blon.

858
01:00:19,703 --> 01:00:23,473
Hated of being the Cinderella
of the household.

859
01:00:23,473 --> 01:00:27,811
A mad desire for the freedom she'd
have if she inherited the estate.

860
01:00:27,811 --> 01:00:33,784
And don't forget, a father
who's a criminal and insane.

861
01:00:33,784 --> 01:00:35,385
Hmm.

862
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:37,860
Ada has unquestionably
inherited this taint.

863
01:00:39,630 --> 01:00:41,091
She discovered these books
in the library.

864
01:00:41,091 --> 01:00:43,260
And read
and reread them...

865
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:48,398
Until she gradually became
obsessed with a mad fantasy
of freedom and murder.

866
01:00:48,398 --> 01:00:54,119
The snowfall on the night of the
first murder gave her her chance.

867
01:00:54,119 --> 01:00:59,042
She got Rex's revolver and galoshes,
sneaked down the balcony stairs,

868
01:00:59,042 --> 01:01:03,346
around and into the front of house,
killed Chester, and shot herself.

869
01:01:03,346 --> 01:01:07,384
The galoshes and the footprints
were simply to throw us off.

870
01:01:07,384 --> 01:01:09,676
She shot herself in the back?

871
01:01:09,676 --> 01:01:11,755
There's a case in that book
exactly like it.

872
01:01:11,755 --> 01:01:16,093
How did she get rid of the gun?
Again the book.

873
01:01:16,093 --> 01:01:19,320
The case of a suicide,
who killed himself on a bridge.

874
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:22,332
He tied a cord with a weight
on it to his gun,

875
01:01:22,332 --> 01:01:24,000
and hung the weight over the side,

876
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,904
so that after he shot himself,
the weight pulled the gun into the water.

877
01:01:27,904 --> 01:01:30,974
When Sproot told me that
her window was open

878
01:01:30,974 --> 01:01:34,010
the night she was shot,
I knew it was Ada.

879
01:01:34,010 --> 01:01:36,713
She had her gun pulled through
the open window.

880
01:01:36,713 --> 01:01:39,480
And she poisoned Mrs. Greene?

881
01:01:40,739 --> 01:01:42,929
And herself too?
To throw us off again.

882
01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:47,224
She caught that bell cord in the
dog's teeth to get the alarm.

883
01:01:47,224 --> 01:01:50,293
The bed was too high for the dog
to have jumped there himself.

884
01:01:50,293 --> 01:01:52,963
Sure it was.
And Sergeant,

885
01:01:52,963 --> 01:01:57,000
when Dr. Von Blon took Sibella
with him to Greenwich the other night,

886
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,236
he probably saved her life.

887
01:01:59,236 --> 01:02:02,410
Before Ada had another chance at her...
But Vance!

888
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:06,210
Ada and Sibella
are together on the roof now!

889
01:02:10,447 --> 01:02:12,049
Quick, Sergeant!

890
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:19,756
Simpkin, hop a couple
of men up here, quick!

891
01:02:22,859 --> 01:02:26,029
What's the matter?
The door to the roof is locked.

892
01:02:26,029 --> 01:02:27,264
Come on, boys.
We'll break it in.

893
01:02:27,264 --> 01:02:29,533
No, wait!
She'll hear us coming.

894
01:02:29,533 --> 01:02:33,637
The only way we can save Sibella is
to get up there without being heard.

895
01:02:33,637 --> 01:02:36,440
You're right.
We try a window.

896
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:38,442
When you boys get our signal,

897
01:02:38,442 --> 01:02:40,944
break through that door to the roof,
do you understand?

898
01:02:40,944 --> 01:02:41,878
Yes sir.
Come on, Sergeant.

899
01:02:41,878 --> 01:02:44,347
Stand by, boys,
for the signal.

900
01:03:13,259 --> 01:03:16,279
Look, Sibella!
You can see the boats from here.

901
01:03:16,279 --> 01:03:18,048
What of it?

902
01:03:26,123 --> 01:03:27,424
Shhh!

903
01:03:27,424 --> 01:03:31,028
Sibella, look!

904
01:03:35,966 --> 01:03:42,939
Ahhhh!
Help, help!

905
01:04:07,597 --> 01:04:09,466
One more heave...

906
01:04:09,466 --> 01:04:19,843
Help! Oh, oh please.
Oh, oh help me! Help!

907
01:04:19,843 --> 01:04:32,055
Oh, help!
Quickly! Quick!

908
01:04:32,055 --> 01:04:38,562
Easy...
Hold it...

909
01:05:01,818 --> 01:05:04,321
Let's get downstairs, quick!

910
01:05:06,056 --> 01:05:10,694
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Vance.

911
01:05:10,694 --> 01:05:14,097
Arthur told me it would be
all right with you around.

912
01:05:14,097 --> 01:05:16,400
Oh, thank you.
Uh, Mr. Vance.

913
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:19,469
You'll excuse me.
Yes, Sergeant?

914
01:05:19,469 --> 01:05:22,072
Well, it's all over.
She went straight through the ice.

915
01:05:22,072 --> 01:05:25,108
The boys are still at it,
but there's not a chance.

916
01:05:25,108 --> 01:05:28,912
She must have been cuckoo
to go after Miss Sibella

917
01:05:28,912 --> 01:05:30,113
with us right here in the house.

918
01:05:30,113 --> 01:05:32,649
Not at all, Sergeant.

919
01:05:32,649 --> 01:05:35,719
Miss Sibella's death would have
looked like suicide

920
01:05:35,719 --> 01:05:38,188
and a confession of guilt,
don't you see?

921
01:05:41,158 --> 01:05:45,228
Well, goodbye.
I'll telephone your husband.

922
01:05:45,228 --> 01:05:46,530
You know?

923
01:05:46,530 --> 01:05:50,634
Yes. When you and Dr. Von Blon
were missing the other night,

924
01:05:50,634 --> 01:05:52,703
and when he told me
he had been at Greenwich,

925
01:05:52,703 --> 01:05:55,439
I rather suspected
you had been married.

926
01:05:55,439 --> 01:05:58,208
So I verified it through
the county clerk there.

927
01:05:58,208 --> 01:06:02,012
May I wish you great happiness.

928
01:06:02,012 --> 01:06:04,614
Thank you.
Goodbye.

929
01:06:04,614 --> 01:06:09,853
Ah, I just one thing more...
What's that, Sergeant?

930
01:06:09,853 --> 01:06:11,722
What did Ada do with the gun?

931
01:06:11,722 --> 01:06:14,257
There was no water for it
to fall in like you said.

932
01:06:14,257 --> 01:06:16,727
No, but there was snow.

933
01:06:16,727 --> 01:06:17,828
Snow?

934
01:06:17,828 --> 01:06:20,831
Snow.
Oh!

935
01:06:21,750 --> 01:06:25,836
Well, after all, Mr. Vance,
life's just a problem.

936
01:06:25,836 --> 01:06:27,637
Right again, Sergeant.
