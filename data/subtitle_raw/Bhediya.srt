1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Beep.

2
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,120
This story's name is...

3
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,880
The wolf and the seven lambs.

4
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,360
It all happened many years ago.

5
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,480
In one such dense forest

6
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,760
there lived a sheep
with her seven lambs

7
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,400
in a little house.

8
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,720
One fine day
as the sheep was heading out,

9
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,920
she told her lambs...

10
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,480
"Kids, until I get back home"

11
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,480
"do not open the door
for anyone else."

12
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,120
But...

13
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,760
Guess who was hiding outside
and eavesdropping on them?

14
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,240
Who?

15
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,280
A ferocious WOLF!

16
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,800
Once the sheep left

17
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,200
the wolf knocked on the door.

18
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,360
Thud!

19
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,080
Thud!

20
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,080
Thud!

21
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,960
So the lambs called out -
"Who is it?"

22
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,600
The wolf replied...

23
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,360
"Your mother."

24
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,920
"Your mother."

25
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,960
Who's there?

26
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:29,520
BHEDIYA (Wolf)

27
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,520
No.

28
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,560
Sir...

29
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,080
Sir... Sir...

30
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,760
Sir, he seems to be in an angry mood.

31
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,520
Why are you so scared?

32
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,000
Sir, I'm not scared of him.

33
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,200
I just don't like dogs.

34
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,600
Dog?

35
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,000
How would you feel
if he called you a dog?

36
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,240
Sorry, boss.

37
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,640
Now who's the boss here?

38
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,160
Sorry, Boss!

39
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,560
Okay.

40
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,440
Now let's talk business.

41
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,320
Speaking of the North-East project...

42
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,120
The land survey is complete.

43
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,560
The papers are ready.

44
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,880
Are you done with your prep?

45
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,680
Yes, sir. I have a local contact there.

46
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,360
I've already made all arrangements.

47
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,080
Land acquisition won't be easy.

48
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,720
In the jungles of the North East.

49
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,520
You don't get paid big bucks
for the easy jobs.

50
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,760
You know it better than anyone.

51
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,640
This is a major contract.

52
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,320
Many major companies had their eyes on it.

53
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,080
But it finally went to a small time
contractor like you.

54
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,080
Do you know why?

55
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,640
Because I like your hunger, baby!

56
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,080
And I like your hunger, too, baby!

57
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,880
My bossy vossy...

58
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,120
Thank you, Mr. Bagga!

59
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,240
And believe me,
I'll get the job done.

60
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,000
The point is

61
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,560
it needs to be done on time.

62
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,960
Sir, I mortgaged my house
to pay your security deposit.

63
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,240
I'll give it all I've got.

64
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,720
What say, Boss?
Does he really mean it?

65
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,320
- He approves of you.
- Yes, sir.

66
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,920
You son of a gun!

67
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,600
The government budget regulation
is basically affected by

68
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,480
active, permanent
and structural factors...

69
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,920
Done packing your bags?

70
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,000
Yes, long ago.

71
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,640
Bro, where are we going?

72
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,000
Why do you care?

73
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,480
I have to prepare for the IAS exams.

74
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,640
I won't budge unless you tell me.

75
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,600
You love nature, don't you?

76
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,520
The place we're going to is right
in the lap of nature.

77
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,520
And the girls are also pretty there.

78
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,240
Your mother was saying
we should get you married.

79
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,880
No way, man.

80
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,640
I'll only marry after
I become an IAS officer.

81
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,160
Then forget about it.

82
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,760
Yes, Dad?

83
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,280
I heard you're leaving
for Arunachal all of a sudden?

84
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,280
It's not sudden.
I'm going there on important business.

85
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,840
How will you manage all alone?

86
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,400
I won't be alone.
I've got Janardan with me.

87
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,480
Greetings, Uncle!

88
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,680
Yeah Greetings...

89
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,800
Aunty was saying he still gets seizures.

90
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,920
All right, take him along.

91
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,840
He will keep you company
in that foreign land.

92
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,280
It's not a foreign country, Dad.

93
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,640
- Arunachal Pradesh is in India.
- Yes, whatever...

94
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,680
Don't teach me geography now.

95
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,416
Okay, I'll call you later
I'm having lunch.

96
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,440
Hello... He...

97
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,360
I see! Arunachal Pradesh...
So we're going to Imphal?

98
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,760
Imphal is in Manipur.

99
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,080
Oh, right!

100
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,120
Sorry our ticket must be for Meghalaya?

101
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,640
Meghalaya is a state.
We're going to Guwahati.

102
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,880
Oh, right! So sorry.

103
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,640
Guwahati is the capital
of Arunachal Pradesh. Right!

104
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,320
Guwahati is in Assam.

105
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,920
The capital of Arunachal Pradesh
is Itanagar.

106
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,400
Since when?

107
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,400
Just pass the curd.
IAS isn't your cup of tea.

108
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,000
Honk! Honk!

109
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,160
That's it?
Couldn't you pack some more luggage?

110
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,720
No, bro. A wise man once said...
Carry knowledge, not burden.

111
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,920
So this is all I got.

112
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,160
Is this knowledge?

113
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,920
These are my books! I've got to study!

114
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,080
Bhaski!

115
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,480
Hey, Jo!

116
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,160
How've you been?

117
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,160
All good, pal.

118
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,720
- After four long years.
- I know.

119
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,400
- Your hair looks great.
- Really?

120
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,360
- Yes.
- Even you got this macho beard.

121
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,280
- Yeah, I try.
- Did you travel alone?

122
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,880
Here's my cousin... Janardan.

123
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,120
JD, JD..

124
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,320
Hello! Jomin!

125
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,880
Chow mein?

126
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,200
Jomin...

127
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,680
Hello, Jo... Jomin!

128
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,520
- "Hey! All good?
- Yeah, kind of!"

129
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,960
- " All good?
- Yeah, kind of!"

130
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,400
- "All good?
- Yeah, kind of!"

131
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,840
- "What about you?
- Yeah, kind of!"

132
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,160
- "All good?
- Yeah, kind of!"

133
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,680
- "All good?
- Yeah, kind of!"

134
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,160
- "All okay with you?
- Yeah, I guess!"

135
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,600
- "And you?
- Yeah, kind of!"

136
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,000
"Such a lovely view!
Why the sudden silence?"

137
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,160
"Look at the sun go down
oh so slowly!"

138
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,640
- "All good?
- Yeah, kind of!"

139
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,960
- "All good?
- Yeah, kind of!"

140
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,520
- "All good?
- Yeah, kind of!"

141
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,200
"Why don't you say something, pal!"

142
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:44,280
"We're just killing time
counting the miles past!"

143
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,960
"When the road finally
starts to smoothen out..."

144
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:04,000
"Could you please pull over
so I can pee!"

145
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:13,400
"We have been through
such a rough patch of road!"

146
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,480
"My whole body is rattling
like loose nuts and bolts!"

147
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:22,280
"Jungle all around,
this area isn't safe"

148
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:27,160
"There are mosquitoes everywhere, and
the mosquitoes have dengue and malaria"

149
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:32,000
"There's a chance
we might find a jungle beauty"

150
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:37,360
"following the beauty
we might find some wild wolf instead"

151
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,760
"What if the wolf comes?
What if he eats us all?"

152
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,920
"Anyway I hear that wolves
are big on keto diets lately"

153
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,360
- "All good?
- Yeah, kind of!"

154
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,760
- "All good?
- Yeah, kind of!"

155
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,160
- "What about you?
- Yeah, kind of!"

156
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,200
- "What about you?
- Do you want it on paper?"

157
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,200
Hey, mister!

158
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,760
"We're just killing time
counting the miles past!"

159
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,720
"The tanker of life has a leak,
on top that the network too is weak."

160
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,640
"To add insult to injury,
you ask me if all is good?"

161
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,600
"All good?"

162
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,160
"All good?"

163
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,800
- Hey!
- Watch out!

164
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,040
Why are you so scared of dogs?

165
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,560
I'm not scared of them.
I... I just hate dogs.

166
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,280
- Good doggy!
- Oh, my, my!

167
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,080
This house is made of bamboos!
What if one of them breaks?

168
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,200
It'll shoot straight up your...

169
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,960
That's how we do it here.

170
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,840
This is great.
Then it won't be a waste.

171
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,960
It has many uses.

172
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,680
Bhaski, it is actually made with bamboos!

173
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,800
Why is it so dark in here?

174
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,560
- Turn on the lights.
- Hold on.

175
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,040
Where's the switch?

176
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,376
Is this what you call a great place?

177
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,400
Turn on the heater.

178
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,800
I'm on it.

179
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,640
Come on...

180
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,120
Don't break anything.
We'll have to pay a fine.

181
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,800
Can I get some water, Jomin?

182
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,320
Will bamboo water do?

183
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,600
I think I see something.

184
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,320
- Huh?
- What?

185
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,320
- What?
- I saw something move.

186
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,840
Where?

187
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,800
I think it's a bat.

188
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,240
Yuck.

189
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,080
It's so ugly.

190
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,800
Aww, it's cute.

191
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,320
So have it in a soup.

192
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,240
Sir, you haven't turned on the lights.

193
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,600
Mummy!

194
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,480
Bhaski, help!

195
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,240
Mummy!

196
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,120
Mummy!

197
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,360
So many bats!

198
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,720
Where have you brought me, Bhaski?
Let's go.

199
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,640
Bhaskar sir!

200
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,040
Welcome!

201
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,600
Welcome to Ziro!

202
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,480
- Jo, who is this clown?
- Welcome, welcome...

203
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,720
Thanks for coming!

204
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,880
- Thanks for bringing... Thanks than...
- For me?

205
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,200
- Take this one. This one's coloured.
- Sure!

206
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,760
Sir, it's okay.
Shut up.

207
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,320
This colour... Okay.

208
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,120
- Meet our Liasoning Officer Mr. Panda.
- Panda?

209
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,656
- Nice to meet you, Mr. Panda.
- Same here.

210
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,256
- Are you from around here?
- No. He's not.

211
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,080
- He's an outsider.
- I was born in another state.

212
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,640
But I've been here since I was a child,
so I'm a local.

213
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,560
Right!

214
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,736
That's why we need your help

215
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,296
- to build a road here, Mr. Panda.
- This way, please.

216
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,600
- I will surely help you.
- Good.

217
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,320
But forget about building a road here.

218
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,000
Why?

219
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,840
I mean, it's easier said than done.

220
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,360
If we have a friend like you
it's as good as done.

221
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,040
This is the biggest infrastructure project
of your state.

222
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,160
Our route begins
from the jungles of Ziro

223
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,960
- and goes straight...
- Through the middle of the jungle?

224
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,560
Can't it be built around
the boundary of the jungle?

225
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,160
Yes, true.

226
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,440
Mr. Neri, you're a senior engineer.

227
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,520
You should be aware
of how costly that would be.

228
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,440
Believe me. If a job that costs 100
bucks can be done in 10.

229
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,800
We will save 90.

230
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,040
Out of which, you will get 20.

231
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,880
And so will you, you too could get 20.

232
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,080
And if something is left,
us paupers can keep the change.

233
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,640
You have our full support.

234
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,960
Even I'll extend full co-operation.

235
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,240
- Thank you.
- But the tribals dwelling in the jungle..

236
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,680
Will they agree to this?

237
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,920
Why won't they?

238
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,200
Sir, the Apatani tribal folks

239
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,360
have been living in this jungle
since over 20 generations.

240
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,680
This is not just their home
but their entire livelihood.

241
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,080
They worship these forests.

242
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,280
I don't think they'll give up
their land so easily.

243
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,360
Come on, Mr. Panda.
They'll have to give it up.

244
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,680
For how long will we live like cavemen
in the name of conservation?

245
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,640
What about the environment?

246
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,200
Sir, we needn't worry
so much about nature.

247
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:20,160
Ask yourselves.
Who cares about nature in these times?

248
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,560
The plants in our balcony
is the closest thing to nature for us.

249
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,160
Believe me, sir.
Once this road is built in your town.

250
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,360
Ziro will be Number 1.

251
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,120
- Sir...
- Yes?

252
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:25,520
You've got the how's and when's
of the project very well.

253
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,160
But you haven't grasped the why.

254
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,480
Why?

255
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,000
Why?

256
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:35,080
Why hasn't a road been built
in this jungle yet?

257
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,720
Why?

258
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,360
Because it dwells in the jungle.

259
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,320
It?

260
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,840
- What do you mean by 'It'?
- Hold on.

261
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,920
Mr. Panda, what are you referring to?

262
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,920
Yapum!

263
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,240
- Yapum!
- What nonsense!

264
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,880
They're just rumours among locals.

265
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,160
Rumours can be true sometimes.
It sounds scary!

266
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,360
What on earth is Yapum?

267
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,680
A virus...

268
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,680
A virus from the depths
of the jungle.

269
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,200
Yapum, Virus...
Coming here was a mistake!

270
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,000
- Mr. Panda, whose side are you on?
- Sir...

271
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,520
I work for you,
so, of course, on your side.

272
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,560
Mr. Panda, money is
the biggest disinfectant.

273
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,200
Bacteria, viruses, parasites...
It destroys them all.

274
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,160
Just fix a meeting with the locals.
We'll handle the rest.

275
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,440
- Right, bro.
- Hey! What are you doing!

276
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,240
Look!

277
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,320
Look! Look!

278
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,400
Bro... A python!

279
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,320
Awesome!

280
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,600
Then wrap it around your neck.

281
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,320
Just run it over.

282
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,840
Let's get out of here.

283
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,120
No, no, sir.
No.

284
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,400
If we don't harm it
it won't harm us, either.

285
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,480
What if it bites someone?
It's roaming outside freely!

286
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,560
Sir, this jungle is its home.

287
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,520
It's you who is the outsider.

288
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,160
And so are you.

289
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,240
- Let's go.
- Inside the forest?

290
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,440
My home is nearby.

291
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,640
Here?

292
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,880
A person that understands his people

293
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,560
is considered family.

294
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,200
And the one who doesn't
is the real outsider.

295
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,160
Bhaski, look!
A Chinese buffalo!

296
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,640
- It does look like one...
- No, no! No, sir.

297
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,320
No Chinese.

298
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,640
It's called a Mithun.

299
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,080
Never insult a Mithun.

300
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,000
Its ego is really huge.

301
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,160
Oh!

302
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,400
Sorry...

303
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,680
See you around then.

304
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,160
- See you.
- He's right about that.

305
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,840
This man seems like trouble.

306
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,200
We cannot trust him.

307
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,480
Who names an animal after a celebrity?

308
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,280
I'm sure his goat is named Mumtaz.

309
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,440
Why Mithun?
Call it Jeetendra, or Dharmendra even.

310
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,760
Why Mithun?

311
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,960
But no, Bhaski.

312
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,440
One should never insult a Mithun.

313
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,000
It's revered, here in Arunachal.

314
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,680
Really? What about you insulting
our actor Mithun?

315
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,200
Even we think highly of him.
And he's a cobra.

316
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,560
Hey! Stop it.

317
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,640
Hey!

318
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,880
Mummy! Mummy!

319
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,440
Mummy!

320
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,880
Mummy!

321
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,600
Mummy!

322
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,600
Mummy!

323
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,000
We're alive!

324
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,000
Can't you drive properly?

325
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,560
- I saw something back there.
- Idiot.

326
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,680
Come on.

327
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,040
- What do you think?
- Mithun!

328
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,680
Mithun!

329
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,640
Go on, insult him some more!

330
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,760
You hurt his ego.

331
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,040
Yes, bro.
He seems mad at us.

332
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,960
Rubbish!

333
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,360
Do you mean this Mithun caused
the accident?

334
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,160
Who else then?
Of course it was him.

335
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,560
Let's get the car out, please!
Come on.

336
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,680
Let's see.

337
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,736
- He should do it, it's his car after all.
- Jo, hold on.

338
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,800
What's wrong?

339
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,080
Something's over there.

340
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,240
Something's moving.

341
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,240
Where?

342
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,840
You scaredy-cat!

343
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,720
Check if the radiator is blown.

344
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,320
Let me check.

345
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,760
- Hold this, JD.
- Hold on.

346
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,200
- Hello! Hello!
- Dad!

347
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,560
- Hello!
- Dad! Hello...

348
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,520
Son, I cannot see you!

349
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,040
I never see you properly.

350
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,960
Did you mortgage grandpa's house?

351
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,280
Why are you worried about that?
I'll take care of it.

352
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,680
If you want any money...

353
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,576
Of course I want money but that doesn't
mean you mortgage grandpa's house.

354
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,120
- Hello!
- Hel...

355
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,160
Hey! Answer me!
Hello...

356
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,520
- Hey, JD!
- What?

357
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,080
- Behind you!
- What?!

358
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,160
The Jungle!

359
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,880
Go ahead, laugh some more.
Go on.

360
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,800
- Coward!
- Laugh away.

361
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,760
He thinks this is funny.

362
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,680
"When I fell in love with you"

363
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,200
"my life went for a toss!"

364
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,000
JD! Jo! Help me!

365
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,960
- Don't look back this time.
- JD!

366
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,640
- Fool me twice, shame on me.
- Help! Jo!

367
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,800
Help!

368
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,560
- Help!
- Such overacting. My God!

369
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,160
- JD! Jomin!
- Hey, JD.

370
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,960
- Yes?
- He's really not there.

371
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,600
- Help! Help!
- Bhaski!

372
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:19,400
JD! Jo!
Hey...

373
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,560
JD! Jomin!

374
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,120
- Help!
- Bhaski!

375
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,560
- Bhaski!
- Bhaski!

376
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,280
Bhaski! Slow down, bro!

377
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,920
Help!

378
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,240
Help!

379
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,880
- Bhaskar!
- Bhaski!

380
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,000
Help! Help!

381
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,840
Hey! What's that!

382
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,960
It bit him!

383
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,320
- Jo! Please do something!
- What can I do?

384
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,880
Do some Kung fu or something, dammit!

385
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,520
Give it here!

386
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,120
Hit this thing, not me!

387
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,456
- What are you doing!
- Sorry, pal!

388
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,240
Throw it! Throw it!

389
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,960
Good job, Jomin! Very good. Once more!

390
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,800
It ran away!
It ran away! It ran away!

391
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,800
Bhaski!

392
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,480
- Come on.
- Come on.

393
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,240
Oh! Bhaski...

394
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,520
Bhaski... Bhaski! Are you okay?

395
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:56,040
Bhaski! What happened?
He bit my brother's bum!

396
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,120
He bit his bum!
What do we do?

397
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:58,960
Let's get out of here!

398
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,640
Let's go! Let's go!

399
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,560
- Oh God...
- Hang on, Bhaski.

400
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,400
Jomin, he's bleeding bad!

401
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,000
How far is the hospital?

402
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,960
- No! Not the local hospital.
- Why?

403
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,920
If anyone finds out
that Bhaski was bitten by an animal

404
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,800
rumours will fly everywhere!

405
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,176
Even the project will stall.

406
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,640
Where do we take him then, a temple?

407
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,040
Forget the project.
He could die!

408
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,520
Wait, give me a second.
I'll think of something!

409
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,040
He'll think of something!

410
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,120
We've reached!

411
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,200
Where have you brought us?

412
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,000
I said hospital,
you've brought us to a stable!

413
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,760
- Come on, quick.
- Bhaski.

414
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,440
- JD, pick him up.
- Yeah, you go ahead.

415
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,560
- Come on.
- Hurry.

416
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,160
Come on, Bhaski..

417
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,600
Okay, come on!

418
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,040
Hang in there, buddy.

419
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,800
- Come on.
- It's dripping so much!

420
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,440
Veterinary clinic?

421
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,720
A veterinary doctor?
Have you lost your marbles?

422
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,120
I don't know,
but this is the best option here.

423
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,000
Option? His buttock is missing
and you're counting options!

424
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,600
- Yes?
- Don't know what you mean...

425
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,360
- Jomin!
- Hi, Anika!

426
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,080
- What happened to him?
- He was attacked by an animal.

427
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,376
- Please help.
- Where did it bite him?

428
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,400
Over here..

429
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,640
- It's bleeding badly.
- Oh, s**t! Which animal was it?

430
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,760
Looked like a wild dog.
Can you help him?

431
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,040
Me?

432
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,000
I can manage, I think.

433
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,440
Are you even trained?

434
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,480
Trained enough for this situation maybe.

435
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,200
I think? Maybe?
A doctor should not talk this way!

436
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,040
Don't worry, JD!
Trust the doctor.

437
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,560
- She's a doctor for animals!
- Even man is an animal.

438
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,640
- Did she just quote an idiom?
- She can handle it.

439
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,000
My brother's life and a**...

440
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,880
I mean, his posterior
is in your hands now.

441
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,280
Posterior what?

442
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,760
He means bum.

443
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,496
- Hurry up, please!
- Don't worry! Don't worry!

444
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,640
Save him please!

445
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,680
I can't even bear to look at it.

446
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,280
Neither can I.

447
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,800
It chewed up his bum like
it were an apple!

448
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,240
That rascal dog!

449
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,640
Had I not taken his wallet

450
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,040
his bum would've been safe.

451
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,720
- It carved a crater into it.
- What do you mean?

452
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,920
- I meant, a hole.
- It's more like a ditch.

453
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,960
- It can fit an entire tennis ball.
- Yes.

454
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,240
How will he survive
with just a single bum?

455
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,400
He can. People manage
to survive on a single kidney.

456
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,320
How will he ever ride a bike?

457
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:20,440
He will ride it fine,
but his balance will be shaky.

458
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,400
How will he sit on the toilet?

459
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,600
Which pocket will he put his wallet in?

460
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,240
How will he live
with a disfigured bum?

461
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,720
- His sex appeal is gone forever!
- Stop your commentary.

462
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,440
I can hear you all.

463
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,640
Sorry, bro...

464
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,440
Sorry, Bhaski!
Just hang in there.

465
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,960
Will you please do the hon ours?

466
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,520
- Do you even plan to?
- What? Oh! Yes.

467
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,840
Pal, let her do it.

468
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,640
Be patient...

469
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,080
What's this?

470
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,480
Sorry! This is meant for horses.

471
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,440
Should I inject him?

472
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,120
Is she really asking us!

473
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,320
- Anika, do it.
- Yes?

474
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,440
Go ahead.

475
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,200
D-Deep breath...

476
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,160
Yuck!

477
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,280
Does it hurt to sit on a chair?

478
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,520
It's your first day with half a bum.
How does it feel?

479
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,880
Hold on. Can I touch it?

480
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,920
Does it hurt?

481
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,040
No.

482
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,840
Actually, I feel better.

483
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,840
That's like my brave cousin!

484
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,560
The doctor helped after all.

485
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,800
What's that fragrance?

486
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,960
But I haven't even showered yet.

487
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,400
Seems like that animal injection
worked after all.

488
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,800
He's strutting like Anil Kapoor!

489
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,360
What happened, bro?

490
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,800
Hey, Bhaski!
Hey!

491
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,600
Yuck! What are you doing?!

492
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,760
What are you doing?

493
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,920
I could smell this back
at the guest house...

494
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,600
Are you crazy?
The guest house is so far away.

495
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,616
- How could you possibly smell it?
- Bhaski, throw it away.

496
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,920
You'll fall sick.

497
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:42,000
He's Mr. Bhaskar.
He's from the government.

498
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,680
We want to build a road
passing through your jungle.

499
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,360
And for that we need
some of your forest land.

500
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,640
Some of you may lose your houses.

501
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,040
But if a road is built,
everyone will gain from it.

502
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,360
It's better if you give it up,
or the government has its ways.

503
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,840
- What?
- They're refusing, sir.

504
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,440
Mr. Panda...

505
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,640
We're here to help you out.

506
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,800
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry, sir!

507
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,520
- Sorry, sir!
- Okay! Okay! Okay!

508
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,400
- Okay, we're leaving.
- Bhaski, let's go!

509
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,200
Bhaski, go!

510
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,280
Sorry, aunty!

511
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,840
What's wrong with them!

512
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,520
- They pulled out swords!
- It's not a sword. It's called a Dao.

513
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,720
Panda is screwing us over.

514
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,440
He's a real shady fellow.
We need to find someone else.

515
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,040
No, pal. He was appointed
by the government.

516
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,040
- But Jomin, he knows nothing...
- Mr. Bhaskar!

517
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,720
Please come here, sir.

518
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,600
- What's wrong with your people?
- They won't agree, sir.

519
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,280
You better drop this idea
of building a road.

520
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,520
He's right.

521
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,120
It's wrong to cut down the jungle
to build a road.

522
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,976
And keeping the state disconnected from
the rest of the country and calling it China

523
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
isn't that wrong?

524
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,960
How can there be development
without a road?

525
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,840
- People don't get it.
- Hey!

526
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,760
It's you who doesn't get it.

527
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,840
Do not forget, Bhaski.

528
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,760
If there's nature, there's progress.

529
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,440
- Good boy...
- Really?

530
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,640
Mr. Panda...

531
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,120
Just set up a meeting
with the youngsters.

532
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,640
- Hope you can do this at least.
- Definitely, sir.

533
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,880
Always at your service, sir.

534
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,600
Sir, you better talk to Prakash,

535
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,400
- the timber contractor.
- Yes.

536
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,840
He's the youth leader.
People here listen to him.

537
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,040
Take him into confidence.

538
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,600
Your village is really mind-blowing!

539
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,680
Amazing!

540
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,920
I mean...

541
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,680
Look! There are huge malls there!

542
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,320
Oh, my God! A multiplex, too!
You can go watch movies there!

543
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:44,600
There's a coffee shop, too!
I can smell the coffee!

544
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,040
Smell it.

545
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,920
There are MNCs, too,
in the village centre.

546
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
There are corporate centres
and big industries!

547
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,240
There's a giant airport as well!

548
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,200
Look, I see planes flying!

549
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,720
What are you looking at?
There's nothing.

550
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,200
Do you see anything?

551
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,560
This forest has turned you all into
frogs in a well.

552
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,400
We want to cut down this jungle

553
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,440
and connect you to the outside world.

554
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,280
We want to cut down this jungle
and build a road.

555
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,080
But the old generation won't get it.

556
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:22,360
They don't even know
what this generation wants.

557
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:25,440
You want Netflix, not nature.

558
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,640
You want i-Pads, not trees.

559
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,440
You want Starbucks, not black-bucks.

560
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,640
You prefer Jungle Book
over jungles

561
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,440
and Tiger Shroff over real tigers!

562
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,280
Because development should be done

563
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:42,280
of the youth, by the youth,
for the youth.

564
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:47,000
- Do you want to make Ziro number 1?
- Yes.

565
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,840
Then folks...

566
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,560
We need your cooperation for this project.

567
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,160
- Will you extend it?
- Yes!

568
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,680
- Sure?
- Yes.

569
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,280
But it's your duty
to convince the village elders.

570
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,520
And don't worry.

571
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,160
That rascal Prakash...

572
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:24,320
He bribed everyone
and took the timber contract.

573
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,440
Are you okay?

574
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,200
What's wrong, sir?

575
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,000
- Bhaski!
- Here...

576
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,360
It's okay.

577
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,600
- He fell sick suddenly.
- Bhaski!

578
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,040
- Make everyone sign the stamp paper.
- Okay, sir.

579
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,520
- Good.
- What happened, brother?

580
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,120
- Sir...
- My ears are ringing.

581
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,840
Sir, you better meet our Ojha.

582
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,920
- Who?
- Ojha, the healer.

583
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,720
I'm fine.

584
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,600
Sir, he's 120 years old.

585
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,200
Asia's best healer!

586
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,800
He can cure any ailment under the sun.

587
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,520
He's in town currently.

588
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,600
Mr. Bhaskar, come in.

589
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,960
He will fix you right up.

590
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,800
I've got stomach ache.

591
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,440
He's opening up your nerves.

592
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,920
Hey, Bhaski!

593
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,560
- Bhaski!
- Bhaski!

594
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,320
Bhaski...

595
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,800
Bhaski!

596
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,400
Bhaski, wait!
Bhaski!

597
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,720
- Bhaski, are you alright?
- Bhaski...

598
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,880
He dipped you in like a tea-bag!

599
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,920
What a crazy old man!

600
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,880
This is impossible!

601
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,680
How can such a deep wound
heal so fast?

602
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,920
There are other problems, too.

603
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,200
What problems?

604
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,600
People lose their hearing,
but mine is somehow heightened.

605
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,720
- A little too much!
- What do you mean?

606
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:02,560
When a phone rings, it feels like
someone is drilling my ears.

607
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,800
Krrrrr...

608
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,640
When someone snaps their fingers
it sounds like drums pounding.

609
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,040
- Bam! Bam! Bam!
- What else?

610
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,920
Smell...
This is the most confusing of all.

611
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,920
All foul smells
have turned into fragrances.

612
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,280
The stench of dead animals
smells like perfume.

613
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,600
- What had you put in the injection?
- Painkiller.

614
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,000
Sit down.

615
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,600
Your heartbeat is way too fast.

616
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,560
This is not normal.

617
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,160
- Rabies?
- Rabies...

618
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,720
Yes, it could be.

619
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,800
- Or maybe not.
- Make up your mind.

620
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,680
I mean, I don't know.
But this is really serious.

621
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,240
Then I should consult
a proper human doctor.

622
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,080
Do not make that mistake here.

623
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,920
Hope you haven't told anyone else.

624
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,040
No.

625
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,000
Good! Because the people here
are superstitious.

626
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,920
Anyway, I'll prescribe
some medicines for now.

627
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,040
Take these.
I think you'll be fine.

628
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,640
I think?

629
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,280
Well, I guess I'll be fine.

630
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,960
But I do feel better after meeting you.

631
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,760
I mean, after meeting a doctor...

632
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,880
Um...

633
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,400
When are you going back?

634
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,800
After a few days,
once my job is done.

635
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,600
You never took me sightseeing
around here.

636
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,800
Are you attending the music festival?

637
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,240
Are you?

638
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,360
Pick one.
Are you going, or not?

639
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:44,240
Don't drink alcohol.
It might react with the medicine.

640
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,680
- Sign or put your thumb-print.
- One by one.

641
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,360
- Your road will be built.
- Get moving.

642
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,960
Come on, put signatures.

643
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,640
- Or put thumb-prints if you like.
- Good!

644
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,920
- Do it quick.
- Come on, next!

645
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,640
Bhaskar sir!

646
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,640
We've got everyone's signatures.

647
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,576
- I'll hand over the papers tomorrow.
- Sure.

648
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,080
- For now, just enjoy!
- Thank you.

649
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:24,040
"We die everyday!
Every single day!"

650
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,360
"Let me live for tonight!"

651
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:31,360
"We do as we please!"

652
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:35,160
"After we get sloshed!"

653
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:38,600
"We die everyday!
Every single day!"

654
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,000
"Let me live for tonight!"

655
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,600
"We do as we please!"

656
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,440
"After we get sloshed!"

657
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:53,080
"My timid heart
has gone wild and crazy!"

658
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,440
"It's a rumble in the jungle!"

659
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,120
"Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on!"

660
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:14,800
"In the jungle...
In the jungle..."

661
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,680
"It's a rumble in the jungle!"

662
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,720
"Let's soar high..."

663
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,360
Keep the work going.
Don't stop at any cost.

664
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,720
I'm coming.

665
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,400
"Let's soar high
and dance all night!"

666
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,080
"Let's drink the night away
and make merry!"

667
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,680
"Let's soar high
and dance all night!"

668
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:47,080
"Let's drink the night away
and make merry!"

669
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:50,760
"Let's soar high
and dance all night!"

670
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:54,560
"Let's drink the night away
and make merry!"

671
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:01,120
"It's a rumble in the jungle!"

672
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:06,240
"O' dangerous, very dangerous!"

673
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,040
"O' the reverie..."

674
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,920
"O' dangerous, very dangerous!"

675
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,640
I found my house!

676
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,840
Bhaski!

677
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Bhaski!

678
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,400
Where were you last night?

679
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,520
I've got a bad tummy.

680
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,880
We tried calling.
Why didn't you answer?

681
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,480
It must be on silent mode.

682
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,800
I got a little too drunk.

683
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,040
Either way,
the food here doesn't suit me.

684
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:08,120
They put bamboo in everything.

685
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,080
- Yes, they do.
- Well...

686
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:11,880
What did you do last night?

687
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,720
Bro, don't you know?

688
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:16,136
- There was a real rumble in the jungle last night.
- What?

689
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,320
- That timber contractor, Prakash Paja..
- Yes?

690
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,640
He was attacked by a wild animal.

691
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,840
It's really bad.
Everyone was looking for him.

692
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,480
- Finally they found him...
- Is he alive?

693
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,480
He has the land documents
of all the tribals.

694
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,280
Don't know.
They took him to the hospital.

695
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,040
And he's in a serious state.

696
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,640
He lost a lot of blood.
This place isn't safe.

697
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:40,160
- You never know what's coming...
- Sir! Sir!

698
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,520
- The police are here.
- But why?

699
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:43,960
They want to see you.

700
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,080
This...

701
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,360
We found it lying in the forest.

702
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:51,680
Is this yours?

703
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:53,720
- Is this yours?
- No!

704
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:54,880
It's mine, sir.

705
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:57,200
You were dancing
in the festival last night.

706
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,320
Then how did this end up
in the forest?

707
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,400
How did this end up in the forest?

708
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:06,000
Prakash liked this jacket last night.

709
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,360
So I gifted it to him
in a drunken spur.

710
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,440
- You gifted it to him?
- Yes.

711
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:13,120
- Buy us gifts too, sometimes.
- Sir!

712
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,520
- Buy him some.
- Officer Tempol!

713
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:17,480
Officer Tempol...

714
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:18,880
Hey, Panda!

715
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,080
Don't you see we're in the middle
of an investigation?

716
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,320
Why investigate them, sir?

717
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:27,120
They can't help you.
Sir, I'm the eye-opener witness!

718
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,640
I saw Prakash's attacker!

719
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,680
Prakash was attacked by an animal.

720
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,680
- It wasn't an animal!
- Then?

721
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:40,320
- Virus.
- Virus?

722
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:41,960
It was the virus.

723
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,720
What we had feared the most has started.

724
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,600
Hey, Panda!

725
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,400
Stop spreading rumours.
It'll cause problems.

726
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,520
Sir, the real problem is the one

727
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,720
who is in the hospital right now.

728
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,840
Tell me what you saw exactly.

729
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,520
Sir, last night

730
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:04,960
when the full moon was shining.

731
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,960
I saw a man approach.

732
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,920
Tap! Tap! Tap!

733
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:15,720
Then suddenly he went..
Tap-tap! Tap-tap!

734
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:18,720
Hold on.
How did the rhythm change?

735
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:22,440
Point to be noted, sir.
He was walking on two feet at first.

736
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,200
Tap! Tap!

737
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:27,400
Then he went down on all fours!

738
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:28,800
Then he pounced on Prakash!

739
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,640
He grabbed him by the neck!
Like this...

740
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:35,240
He sprung upon him
and tore him apart!

741
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Prakash kept struggling on the ground.

742
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:43,680
It was growling, sir!
I can't even..

743
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,200
What happened then?

744
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,680
Then I literally wet my pants.

745
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,480
What's the deal with Panda?

746
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:00,800
Must've gotten drunk last night
and watched a cheap B-grade movie.

747
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,480
- The one with the mummy?
- No, the slasher movie...

748
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:06,880
Where he goes around killing newly-weds.

749
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,120
Or he must have watched
Rahul Roy's movie Junoon.

750
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,520
- The one where he becomes a tiger?
- Exactly!

751
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,840
- A tiger! Seriously...
- You think it's funny.

752
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:17,480
I still cannot understand
how that man started galloping.

753
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:19,760
How can a human run
on all fours?

754
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:22,920
Oh, come on!
I've heard plenty of such urban legends.

755
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:26,080
By the way, we must go see Prakash.

756
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,160
Bhaski.

757
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,960
- Hey, Bhaski!
- Hey, Bhaski!

758
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,960
- What happened?
- Bhaski! Bhaski!

759
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:36,360
Pick him up! Pick him up!

760
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:37,360
Bhaski! Bhaski!

761
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,560
- Yuck!
- Hey!

762
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:42,440
- Bhaski, this way...
- Let him down.

763
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,680
- Oh!
- It's okay. I'm here.

764
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,720
Daddy! Daddy!

765
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,480
- You'll be fine, Brother. I'm here.
- Doctor..

766
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,720
- See, it hurts here.
- Keep your hand here.

767
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:54,760
I think it's severe gastritis.
What did you eat last night?

768
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,120
Prakash...

769
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,560
- I had dinner with Prakash.
- Right.

770
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,120
But what did you eat exactly?

771
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:04,600
Because this happens
when one eats too much red meat.

772
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:07,200
- Did you?
- No, his ex-girlfriend has turned him vegan.

773
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,160
He hardly drinks milk.
Eating meat is out of question.

774
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,000
Let's get his feces tested.

775
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:13,480
- Feces what?
- Speak in Hindi.

776
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:14,560
It is Hindi.

777
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:17,136
It's called Stool Test in English.
Stop listening to Korean songs

778
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,536
and listen to Hindi songs for once.

779
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,240
- I can talk Hindi.
- As if!

780
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,680
Mind your grammar first...
You wait.

781
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:24,800
It's I can speak Hindi.
Not Talk Hindi.

782
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,600
You always mess up the grammar.

783
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:29,240
- This is too much!
- Then speak proper Hindi...

784
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:31,920
- JD, mind it!
- Guys, I'm dying here!

785
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:33,560
Guys! Hello!

786
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,840
- He's not well.
- Yes, exactly.

787
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:38,800
- Please get his stool tested.
- It's not needed yet.

788
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,280
I'll give him an injection.

789
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,000
- Maybe...
- No! No more injections!

790
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,840
- You'll be fine.
- I don't want it!

791
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,256
- I feel better already.
- Grab his legs. Do it!

792
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,240
- Flip him over.
- I'll take digestive pills!

793
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:49,200
- Please don't do this, guys!
- No...

794
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,720
- What are you doing!
- Easy there..

795
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:56,080
- I don't want it!
- Bhaski, stop! Hey!

796
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,440
I said, I don't want it!

797
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,960
Was that injection for horses?

798
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,160
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

799
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:38,640
Yes.

800
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,480
Let's get some Chinese take away.
Bhaski must be hungry.

801
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,080
Bhaski's in a world of trouble,
and you want to hog Chinese food!

802
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:48,640
Focus on what's really happening.

803
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,960
- What?
- Understand the chronology, pal.

804
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:56,920
1. He was bitten by a wild animal.

805
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:00,760
2. His wounds healed in no time.

806
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,320
3. He can smell things really far.

807
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:08,120
4. Back at the Ojha's cottage
he was scared of water.

808
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,880
5. Prakash was attacked.

809
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,640
6. Bhaskar's jacket was found
in the jungle.

810
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,160
7. His stomach got upset the next day

811
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,960
and we both saw that bloody red vomit.

812
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:22,720
He's become strong as a horse.
How?

813
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:24,400
Understood?

814
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,040
Not a single word.

815
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:30,320
- Hydrophobia.
- Right! That must be it.

816
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:35,920
But what exactly is that?

817
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,080
Rabies!

818
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:40,520
He's contracted a mystical
form of rabies in this place.

819
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:41,960
And that's why Prakash...

820
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:44,560
- Are you suspecting your brother?
- People suspect their wives.

821
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,400
I've witnessed a lot of things.

822
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,040
There's only one way
to confirm our doubts -

823
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:49,760
What?

824
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:50,680
'Mal Parikshan'

825
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:51,760
Stool test.

826
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:54,240
S**t?
He won't allow it.

827
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,320
If it were money,
we could steal from him.

828
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,440
But how will you extract a stool?

829
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:01,200
Yes, that's true...

830
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:08,680
Idea!

831
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,200
Shh!

832
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,960
- Hello, sir!
- Any progress yet?

833
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:17,960
Yes, there is.

834
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:21,400
It's just that one project worker
got attacked by an animal.

835
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,840
What's the big deal?

836
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:26,160
This is common in projects
involving jungles.

837
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:31,560
But he had all the MOUs
and all the papers.

838
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:33,840
I'm looking for his replacement now.

839
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:35,840
I'll wrap up
and leave in a few days.

840
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,360
Sure, leave soon.

841
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:41,200
By the way, did that worker die
after the attack?

842
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,120
Be careful.

843
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:45,960
And just finish this damn thing!

844
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:47,080
Finishing, sir.

845
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,160
- Finish!
- Ah!

846
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:52,560
Janardan!

847
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:54,720
There's no water in here!

848
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:14,720
Hold it in!

849
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:25,840
The report will come in tomorrow.
Clean this up.

850
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:27,240
Okay.

851
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:35,000
Ma'am, where's Prakash Paja admitted?

852
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:36,800
Over there.

853
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,400
Oh! Mr. Virus!

854
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:51,800
What nonsense?
I'm not a virus!

855
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:55,200
You are everything to me!
The ultimate virus!

856
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,000
Have you lost it?
Just give me my papers.

857
00:52:58,080 --> 00:52:59,640
Forget the papers.

858
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,440
Let's hunt as a team from now on.

859
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:05,040
You be Kohli, I'll be Rohit...
A tag team!

860
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:09,000
Sir, I've even made a list of rascals
we need to kill!

861
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:10,880
- I have all the paperwork ready.
- No.

862
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:13,880
First I'll kill Kaso,
the forest officer.

863
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:16,920
I used to cut down trees
but he would usurp the money.

864
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,240
Now I'll go after him!

865
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,320
Then comes Suraj, the milkman!

866
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,400
I'll eat up his buffalo!

867
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:26,720
Let's go, sir!
Let's spread the infestation!

868
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,000
Let's expand our team!
Come on!

869
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,960
Come on! Let's go!

870
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:33,080
- What are you doing here?
- Well..

871
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,520
I... I came to check on Prakash.

872
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:41,520
The doctor is here for that.

873
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,000
So leave.

874
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:52,720
Something isn't right here.

875
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:54,880
Compared to his morning inspection

876
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:56,680
half his wounds have healed!

877
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:57,840
What do you mean?

878
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,720
It's impossible
for wounds to heal so fast.

879
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:03,720
If the staff gets to know
they'll run away.

880
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,280
I think he's infected.

881
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:08,560
- Do you mean the virus?
- Shh.

882
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:12,360
Don't say its name after dark.
We must do something.

883
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,320
Or else, things will go haywire.

884
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:15,560
Let me think of something.

885
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:32,640
- Yapum!
- Yapum!

886
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:35,560
- Yapum!
- Yapum!

887
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:38,600
- Yapum!
- Yapum!

888
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:04,400
Bhaski!

889
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:06,320
What are you doing here all alone?

890
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:08,640
- Where were you?
- I went to talk to Neri.

891
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:09,800
About what?

892
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:11,480
I lured him with a timber contract.

893
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:13,720
Now he will help us,
instead of Prakash

894
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,760
and also convince the local folks.

895
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:17,760
The project won't stop.

896
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:20,120
But Neri was against the project.

897
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:24,000
How did you know that
he wanted the timber contract?

898
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:29,000
This rascal Prakash bribed everyone
and took away the timber contract.

899
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:31,640
I overheard him say it.

900
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:37,120
- You're hearing too much lately.
- And even smelling too much.

901
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:39,120
Bhaski, what are you hiding from us?

902
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:40,560
- Nothing.
- What do you mean?

903
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,856
You've been acting strange
ever since the animal bit you.

904
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:44,040
Have you got rabies?

905
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:46,056
- What do I tell uncle.
- I'm fine, and fully normal.

906
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:48,440
Normal, my foot!
You vomited blood that day.

907
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:49,696
Then you started eating chicken, too.

908
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:51,776
Then during the injection incident
you lifted up the whole bed.

909
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:54,320
- You snap at us...
- What rubbish! I'm totally fine!

910
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,760
You won't tell us the easy way.
Let me call your dad.

911
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:57,920
- Put the phone away.
- Why?

912
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:59,656
- Don't call up dad!
- I won't listen to you!

913
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,480
- I said, I'm fine!
- No, you're not!

914
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:03,400
- I'm totally fine!
- You're not!

915
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:04,600
I said, I'm fine!

916
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:06,280
I told you I'm fine!

917
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:07,960
Bhaski, let him go!

918
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:11,200
Bhaski! Bhaski!

919
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,080
Let go of him, please!

920
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:15,880
JD! Hey, Bhaski!

921
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,760
Hey!
Get away from him! JD!

922
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:27,120
JD, are you okay?

923
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:29,800
- JD!
- Help me get up.

924
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:31,800
Get up!

925
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:41,920
Hello!

926
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,000
W-What!

927
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:53,240
They found traces of human hair, nails
and bone fragments in Bhaski's stools.

928
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:56,200
Are you crazy?
And this is not definitive.

929
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:58,920
I even spoke to my doctor in Delhi.
Even he confirmed it

930
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:01,056
that the stool sample belongs to
a man-eating predator.

931
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:02,280
- Didn't you hear it?
- Yes.

932
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:04,240
So what are you implying?

933
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,720
- Gangadhar is Shaktimaan.
- What?

934
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:10,600
Clark Kent is Superman.
Bhaski is our guy.

935
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:14,280
- What is he saying?
- Speak in Hindi.

936
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:17,560
Bhaski has caught some mystical disease.

937
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:19,920
He ate Prakash because of it.

938
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:21,800
Have you totally lost it?

939
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,680
- Then what about these bones...
- Hello! Hello!

940
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:27,720
Oh, darn! Not him again.

941
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:31,320
Such rowdy people sitting
with a fine lady...

942
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:33,960
And where's our jacket guy?

943
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:35,320
He's not here.

944
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:39,040
I trusted you as our project colleague.

945
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:41,520
And you are spreading rumours
about some virus.

946
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:43,400
I saw it with my own eyes.

947
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:44,960
It's not a story.

948
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:48,200
Never mind him, Mr. Panda.

949
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,120
I've always believed you.

950
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:53,240
And the running man incident
you were telling the cops about...

951
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:55,440
- Come on, JD.
- Hold on! Tell us more.

952
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:58,400
If anyone tries to destroy the jungle

953
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:00,520
the virus will get him.

954
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:04,560
Then that person becomes a wolf.

955
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:08,280
- A shape-shifting wolf...
- My foot!

956
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:10,680
Shape-shifting wolf, it seems.

957
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:12,520
Yes, this does sound like bulls**t.

958
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:14,760
- It's snakes who are shape-shifters.
- Why?

959
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:18,440
Do only snakes have a license
to be shape-shifters?

960
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,240
Can't wolves change form?

961
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:21,800
What rubbish is this, guys?

962
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:24,680
It's a disease...
Lycanthropy.

963
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:27,560
- Lemon what?
- Lycanthropy.

964
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:30,800
It's a mental disorder
where a human thinks he's a wolf.

965
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:32,560
Then he starts acting like a wolf.

966
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:36,080
No, no. It's not just mental.
It's physical.

967
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:39,520
He changes his body
like he changes clothes

968
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:41,800
and suddenly turns into a wolf!
Got it?

969
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:43,560
I don't have time for all this.

970
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:46,080
I'll check this and get back to you.

971
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:47,840
- Sure.
- And...

972
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:53,240
Go ahead, ignore me.

973
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:56,320
- But you can't ignore the wolf.
- Mr. Panda...

974
00:59:57,240 --> 01:00:01,360
Speaking of a human
transforming into a wolf...

975
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:03,080
When does he do it?

976
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:07,280
Poets, newly-wed brides and wolves...

977
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:10,440
They all love full moon nights.

978
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:15,560
When they look at the moon
wolves signal each other.

979
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:22,000
And soon, the infected human

980
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:23,880
turns into a wolf.

981
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:26,800
- Jomin.
- Yes?

982
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:29,320
Hadn't you left the stove on?

983
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:32,520
- To boil the milk?
- Yes, let's go. It may boil over.

984
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,280
See you, Mr. Panda.

985
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:28,360
He must be inside.

986
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:30,200
Come on, let's go.

987
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:31,760
Let's go.

988
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:33,200
Hey, wait!

989
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:35,920
- Quiet! Stay low!
- Don't go without me.

990
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:39,840
He's inside.

991
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:01,200
What was that?!
What the heck was that?!

992
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:02,480
What was that?!

993
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:05,280
What was that?
Bhaski..

994
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:08,080
Come on! Let's follow it!

995
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:09,880
Straight...

996
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:11,040
Maybe it went that way.

997
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:14,080
Straight...
Where did he go? Where did he go?

998
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:17,520
There he is! There he is!

999
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:22,320
Can you even drive?

1000
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:25,400
- There he is! Turn left...
- Okay, okay.

1001
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,520
- Go! Go! Go!
- I'm going!

1002
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:28,920
Drive faster!

1003
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:36,680
He's gone.
How do we find him now?

1004
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:40,960
- There is a way.
- What?

1005
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:42,720
- Let's howl like wolves.
- Crap!

1006
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:44,640
Come on.
He will surely respond.

1007
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:47,000
- But we're not wolves.
- Neither is he.

1008
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:49,080
He's still half-human.
Come on, let's try.

1009
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:50,200
- Me?
- Do it.

1010
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:02,320
This isn't helping.
Let's do it together.

1011
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:03,840
- Okay.
- Come on.

1012
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,160
You sound like a dying pig.

1013
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:13,360
And you sound like a donkey.

1014
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:15,040
Really? Like a donkey?

1015
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:16,320
Don't you tell me...

1016
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:21,360
"O' my love..."

1017
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:29,200
"O' my love..."

1018
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:36,920
"You have me mesmerised."

1019
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:56,520
Where is he?
Did he disappear again?

1020
01:05:56,600 --> 01:06:00,960
- Roll up the windows!
- "O' my love..."

1021
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:02,360
Turn off the music!

1022
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:04,320
Where did he go?

1023
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:14,720
Hold this!

1024
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:33,800
Jomin! I don't want to die!

1025
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:39,360
Jomin! Save me, buddy!

1026
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:41,640
- No! No!
- Stay away!

1027
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:43,840
- Help!
- Go away!

1028
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:46,000
Mummy!

1029
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:48,200
Mummy!

1030
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:49,680
Papa!

1031
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:52,240
Bhaski's undies!

1032
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:53,320
Bhaski's undies!

1033
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:54,720
Bhaski's undies!

1034
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:56,640
Bhaski's undies!

1035
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:36,520
"Everywhere in the jungle,
the news is spreading like wildfire..."

1036
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:41,440
"Everywhere in the jungle,
the news is spreading like wildfire..."

1037
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:46,360
"A new flower has blossomed,
with undies on"

1038
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:48,840
Hi.

1039
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:54,200
You never took me sightseeing,
so I went on my own.

1040
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:56,680
JD and Jomin told me everything.

1041
01:08:58,040 --> 01:08:59,040
Hop on.

1042
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:08,040
Try not to bite me.

1043
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:10,560
"One little bird seemed so embarrassed,"

1044
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:12,760
"Because, it was all bare..."

1045
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:15,720
"It was so much better there,"

1046
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:17,920
"Inside the shell (egg)"

1047
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,600
"Now the bird is wondering,"

1048
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:22,960
"Why am I really out of the shell?"

1049
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:28,080
"A new flower has blossomed,
with undies on"

1050
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:31,000
"Everywhere in the jungle,"

1051
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:33,600
"A new flower has blossomed,
with undies on"

1052
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:36,280
- "Everywhere in the jungle,"
- Where did you find him?

1053
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:38,800
"A new flower has blossomed,
with undies on"

1054
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:40,000
Yes! That's the one!

1055
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:42,120
He was wearing the same undies last night!

1056
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:44,320
And so was that wolf!

1057
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,520
I bet it's ripped from behind.

1058
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:49,480
What do I tell his father now?
That his son became a wolf?

1059
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:50,800
No, drink water first.

1060
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:52,680
Or do you prefer drinking blood?

1061
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:54,960
He was clawing at me!

1062
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:56,800
So you're a big wolf now?

1063
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:58,440
- And doctor...
- Yes?

1064
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:01,400
You kept saying it's lycanthropy.
That it's impossible!

1065
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:04,360
A guy who was barely fit to be called
a human is now a damn wolf!

1066
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:06,160
You stand right there!

1067
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:08,120
I came here from Delhi just for you!

1068
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:10,080
And you hid this from me?

1069
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:12,840
Guys, that's not important now.

1070
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:14,896
What's more important than a brother?

1071
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:16,360
Last night, what...

1072
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:17,920
I mean, whom did he eat?

1073
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:19,520
Speak up.

1074
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,200
Answer her!

1075
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:24,160
Speak up!

1076
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:26,760
Whom did you chomp down last night?

1077
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:29,440
- Burp later! Answer me first!
- What do I say?

1078
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:31,280
I don't know.

1079
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:34,280
We found Prakash in your stools
and you know nothing?

1080
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:35,560
No, I don't!

1081
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:37,680
I don't know what I do every night.

1082
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:40,320
I don't know if I attacked Prakash,
or not.

1083
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:43,720
One feels miserable even
if a fly gets inside his nose.

1084
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:46,240
But a fully grown wolf
has gotten into my body!

1085
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:50,200
It's as if my body is hijacked
by a terrorist!

1086
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:53,200
We always joke about
our pants ripping apart.

1087
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:56,840
My a** literally tears apart
and a tail springs out!

1088
01:10:57,080 --> 01:11:00,640
I sprout dagger-like claws
and fangs like Dracula!

1089
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:02,360
Then I wake up next morning
all naked

1090
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:04,400
with blood on my body
and a snake inside my pants!

1091
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:07,480
But one good thing
came out of all this.

1092
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:09,080
My muscles are so ripped now.

1093
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:11,040
But my life is ruined!

1094
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:14,480
And one more thing,
I can now understand animal language.

1095
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:17,480
Dogs tease me; Calling out
'Uncle! Uncle!'.

1096
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:19,480
- Bluff!
- What bluff?

1097
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:22,480
Sorry, Bhaski...

1098
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:24,120
- Bhaskar!
- Sorry, Bhaski...

1099
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:27,000
Tabaa, why isn't he eating?

1100
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:28,440
Don't know, sir.

1101
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:30,680
Did his girlfriend leave him
or something?

1102
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:33,040
Yes, sir. Minty is missing
since last night.

1103
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:34,760
How do you know?

1104
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:36,880
Did you...

1105
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:41,560
I can understand animals easily
but have no idea about myself...

1106
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:44,200
Where I went last night,
or whom I ate!

1107
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:48,880
Guys, last night some animal ate
a farmer's Mithun.

1108
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:50,800
What!

1109
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:52,320
You ate a mithun!

1110
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:55,760
You could've eaten a pig, or a goat
or a chicken!

1111
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:56,840
Or even a rabbit!

1112
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:58,080
I was a wolf last night!

1113
01:11:58,160 --> 01:11:59,560
Hey! How would he know?

1114
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:01,000
- Let him be.
- No way.

1115
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:02,576
Maybe it's fine for you folks,
but not to us!

1116
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:05,080
JD, why do you always say
this 'you folks' s**t!

1117
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:06,240
- Why?
- Why?

1118
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:07,376
Because we don't want
to bruise a mithun's ego, again.

1119
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:08,960
Guys, stop it!
What are you even saying!

1120
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:10,560
- Ask him to stop!
- Sorry! Hi!

1121
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:14,320
What?

1122
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:32,120
I heard the locals here
hold you in high regard.

1123
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:37,440
Please reassure them
that there's no such virus.

1124
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:40,760
Prakash was a hunter.
He went hunting

1125
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:42,720
and became a prey, himself.

1126
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:44,640
That's no big deal.

1127
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:47,080
I'll pacify the local folks.

1128
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:50,320
But the transaction...

1129
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:52,960
I genuinely thought you were against
cutting down the jungle.

1130
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:56,840
You spoke so much about nature
and ecology the other day.

1131
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:58,760
Everyone talks.

1132
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:01,320
This place has 83 percent forest area.

1133
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:04,080
Cutting down some trees
is no big deal.

1134
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,440
Sir, the CCTV footage!

1135
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:50,120
It's wearing undies!

1136
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:53,840
Which animal wears undies?

1137
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,200
What happened to him?

1138
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:05,280
Excuse me.

1139
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:08,240
Bhaski... Well...

1140
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:09,880
He's a little sensitive.

1141
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:12,840
The sight of blood makes him queasy.

1142
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:14,040
Bhaski...

1143
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:19,320
Bhaski, thank God
you didn't puke there.

1144
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:22,200
Had you thrown up a finger or two,
you'd be exposed.

1145
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:24,520
- Yes. Let's go.
- Let's go.

1146
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:27,840
- The virus is here!
- Come on!

1147
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:30,160
Let's go! The virus is here!

1148
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:33,760
Rumours will spread
like wildfire now.

1149
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Listen, go and get an injection
from Anika.

1150
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:41,480
Meanwhile I'll dispose
of your controversial undies.

1151
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:43,280
I got your back.

1152
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:44,880
Let's go.

1153
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:54,000
We need to do something!
Everyone will know!

1154
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:55,880
The ensuing panic
will shut down this project!

1155
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:57,360
I saw it for myself.

1156
01:14:57,480 --> 01:15:00,000
I was on top of Neri tearing him apart!

1157
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:02,440
- This will go viral now...
- Calm down, Bhaskar!

1158
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:05,080
- Bhaskar, calm down!
- How can I?

1159
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:08,200
If I don't get treated
I'll go around eating people!

1160
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:13,120
There must be a cure for this!
In UK, US, Canada, Australia, Uganda...

1161
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:14,920
I don't think it will help.

1162
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:18,000
- Be positive. You're a doctor...
- I'm a doctor for pets.

1163
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:21,640
I know nothing about diseases spread
by wild animals.

1164
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:25,400
AIDS, Ebola, SARS, bird flu
and even Covid...

1165
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:27,600
All these viruses came from wild animals.

1166
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:29,720
It takes years to find vaccines for them

1167
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:31,280
and some still don't have one.

1168
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:36,720
Maybe this virus is a rare strain
from the forest.

1169
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:39,960
All cursed things come from the forest.

1170
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:44,240
Cursed things?
Forests don't send cursed things.

1171
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:47,960
Cursed people like you tamper
with forests and get into trouble.

1172
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:50,200
Nature has a balance.

1173
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:52,440
If you ruin that
it'll be a problem for you, too.

1174
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:55,960
The jungles you wish to cut down
are India's lungs.

1175
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:59,480
Whatever oxygen is left in your cities
comes from here.

1176
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,520
If you cut these down, too,
you'll choke to death someday!

1177
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:05,016
- Why are you blaming me?
- What else do I do then?

1178
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:06,880
Come on. I'm not some villain.

1179
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:08,400
I'm here to do my job.

1180
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:11,400
All these talks about nature
belong on twitter and Instagram.

1181
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:14,200
But in real life,
only one greenery matters.

1182
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:15,520
The greenery of bills!
Money!

1183
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:19,280
And I'm fighting for
a big house and a big car!

1184
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:21,800
To move into a better neighbourhood.

1185
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:24,720
Your forest doesn't fit in anywhere
amid all this.

1186
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:27,520
This is how I am.
And you know what?

1187
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:28,880
The whole world is such.

1188
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:31,040
Bhaskar, let's stop the project
and leave.

1189
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:33,240
I cannot do that now.

1190
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:36,040
My house and all my money
is at stake here.

1191
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:37,800
I'll go bankrupt.

1192
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:39,640
It's all the same.

1193
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:42,040
- Even I...
- Just shut up, man.

1194
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:45,040
Bhaski, staying alive is our top priority.

1195
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:46,960
It's dangerous here. Let's go.

1196
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:49,440
I am the danger.

1197
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:51,480
I am the one who knocks people out.

1198
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:53,816
And technically,
I've committed two murders.

1199
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:55,400
No, you're just a human.

1200
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:57,840
What's murder for a human
is dinner for a wolf.

1201
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:00,120
Forget all this.
Let's leave.

1202
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:01,440
I can't run away from myself.

1203
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:03,360
The wolf is still inside me.

1204
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:05,000
It's taken control of my mind.

1205
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:07,200
It's listening to us right now
as we speak.

1206
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:09,000
The people I fix during the day

1207
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:11,040
are the ones I kill after
I transform into a wolf.

1208
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:13,040
At this rate, I'll never make it.

1209
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:15,680
Just get this out somehow.

1210
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:17,800
Bhaski, if these people find out

1211
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:19,960
- they will kill you.
- What's wrong?

1212
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:21,360
Someone's here.

1213
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:48,000
- Panda!
- I knew it!

1214
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:50,280
It had to be one among you.

1215
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:53,560
Look!

1216
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:58,280
Want to burn undies?
Want to destroy evidence?

1217
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:02,880
Deliver us from evil!
Deliver us from evil!

1218
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:05,240
Sir, who smashed the window?

1219
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:06,200
Smashed the window?

1220
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:07,280
- Yes.
- Who?

1221
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:10,640
Rubbish!

1222
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:13,080
I always suspected you.

1223
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:16,440
Now I'll tell everyone.

1224
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:19,480
Hey!

1225
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:25,800
Hey! Hey!

1226
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:38,400
The virus!

1227
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:41,400
V... virus!

1228
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:43,960
- Bhaski...
- I don't want this!

1229
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:45,600
I want no evidence!

1230
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:47,720
- Bhaski...
- No! Hey!

1231
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:50,560
- Hold him!
- Bhaski, he will die!

1232
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:52,040
- Please, hold him!
- But how!

1233
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:56,280
- Bhaski!
- Please!

1234
01:18:56,360 --> 01:18:58,800
- How do we stop him!
- No!

1235
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:09,080
You scared the crap out of him.

1236
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:11,200
He's traumatised.

1237
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:18,120
Mr. Panda?

1238
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:20,760
No, he won't bite you.

1239
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:23,400
- He's the virus!
- No, it's not true.

1240
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:25,880
Mr. Panda, I'm not the virus.

1241
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:28,120
I was bitten by another animal.

1242
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:29,600
Sir, I had warned you.

1243
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:32,640
The virus harms anyone
who tries to harm the forest!

1244
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:35,720
I warned you.
Now I need to tell everyone.

1245
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:37,320
I'm going.

1246
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:40,800
Mr. Panda, I'm not the disease,
but a victim of it.

1247
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:43,320
But if you tell people about me

1248
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:46,120
then I'm sorry,
I'll have to bite you.

1249
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:47,920
Then you'll bite someone else.

1250
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:50,040
One by one,
everyone will be infected.

1251
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:53,760
You, your wife, your kids...
And then?

1252
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,320
Herd immunity!

1253
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:56,920
- Really!
- Yes.

1254
01:19:57,320 --> 01:19:59,720
Herd immunity!
This will infect everyone.

1255
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:03,640
It took us millions of years
to become humans from animals.

1256
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:06,760
A single mistake you make now could turn
us all into animals again.

1257
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:09,520
- Do you realise, Mr. Panda?
- Yes.

1258
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:11,480
- You must not tell anyone!
- No.

1259
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:15,360
I'll lock my lips, sir.
I won't squeak a word.

1260
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:21,000
- Take this. Burn it down.
- Sure.

1261
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:30,160
This is great!
Mr. Panda is on our team now!

1262
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:33,320
Always, sir.
I was always on Mr. Bhaskar's team.

1263
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:34,560
Great!

1264
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:37,160
Mr. Panda, you're from around here.

1265
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:39,280
Do you know the cure to this?

1266
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:42,160
What about the 120 year old Ojha?

1267
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:44,320
He must know about this virus.

1268
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:49,440
- Yes. It's possible.
- Where can we find him?

1269
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:52,400
He keeps roaming the forest.

1270
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:55,040
No one knows where to find him.

1271
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:58,640
We may find him tomorrow,
or even after three months.

1272
01:20:58,720 --> 01:20:59,920
Three months?

1273
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:02,320
He will kill the whole city by then.

1274
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:05,240
What do we do until then?

1275
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:07,520
I must do three things until then.

1276
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:10,760
Not die, not kill anyone...

1277
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:13,000
And find a cure.

1278
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,800
I'll find that Ojha for you.

1279
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:25,440
- I will start right away.
- Thank you!

1280
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:28,680
Listen, everyone!

1281
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:31,120
An animal has become a man-eater.

1282
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:34,600
Everyone is hereby warned
not to spread rumours

1283
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:38,240
not to panic
and not lurk near the jungle at night.

1284
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:40,600
"He will come..."

1285
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:42,960
"He will come..."

1286
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:45,120
"He will come..."

1287
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:49,240
"His coming is inevitable."

1288
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:51,560
"He will come..."

1289
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:54,240
- "He will come..."
- I need sniffer dogs!

1290
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:56,640
The ones who go like...

1291
01:21:56,800 --> 01:22:00,880
"His coming is inevitable."

1292
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:03,280
- "He will come..."
- "Go! Go!"

1293
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:05,200
- "He will come..."
- "Go! Go!"

1294
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,040
"Will they let it come again,
I ask you?!"

1295
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:10,576
"And will they let it bite
into my bum again, too?"

1296
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:12,881
"Are we supposed to stay awake
all day and all night too?"

1297
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:14,880
"Are we supposed to worry every day,
I ask you?"

1298
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:15,480
"Tell me!"

1299
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:17,536
"Because now I've got
the whole village backing me."

1300
01:22:17,560 --> 01:22:19,640
"Everyone volunteered;
No one was forced by me."

1301
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:22,080
"We're fully prepared with bamboos
and ropes too."

1302
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:24,360
"He won't be able to break away,
I'm telling you."

1303
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:26,680
"He's not German or Husky, I know."

1304
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:29,096
"If we'll go after him,
he'll break all our bones for sure."

1305
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:31,320
"Will we find it before it finds us,
I ask thee?"

1306
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:33,296
"Friends if we're strangers,
enemies should we meet."

1307
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:35,200
- "Make some noise!"
- "Go! Go!"

1308
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:37,320
- "Make some noise!"
- "Go! Go!"

1309
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:39,320
"Oh yes, I'll continue with it,"

1310
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:42,040
"That too without any drama
or sad bits."

1311
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:44,240
"Hey! I'm so loving this!"

1312
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:46,640
"What do I say,
even this dog here fears it."

1313
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:49,480
No one should panic.

1314
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:52,840
Special hunters have been hired
from Assam.

1315
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:59,280
"How are the moths burning
without a flame?"

1316
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:01,720
- Can you handle it?
- Of course.

1317
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:04,680
"Hey! The virus'
gonna go hounding at night,"

1318
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:07,176
"Someone tell me who's the hunter
and who's being hunted alright!"

1319
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:09,440
"I'll have to risk
my life to stay alive,"

1320
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:11,920
"I'll have to hurry,
or I'll be someone's dinner tonight."

1321
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,920
"Come on, I want everyone to participate,"

1322
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,240
"Don't be scared,
we've got a village to save."

1323
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:18,280
"I want you to scream just like me,"

1324
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:20,576
"If their throat goes dry,
give them some water, please."

1325
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:21,960
"And of course, something to eat."

1326
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:24,720
"And of course, something to eat."

1327
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:26,720
"And of course, something to eat."

1328
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:39,320
"Go! Go! Go Virus!"

1329
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:41,800
"Go! Go! Go Virus!"

1330
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:44,360
Remedies to escape
werewolf attacks.

1331
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:47,640
Romans used the concept of fatigue
for this.

1332
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:49,520
- Fatigue.
- Yes.

1333
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:52,720
A Sicilian belief of Arabic origin states

1334
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:57,000
a werewolf can be cured
by striking its forehead with a knife.

1335
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:01,200
"Go! Go! Go Virus!"

1336
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:03,480
"Go! Go! Go Virus!"

1337
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:33,440
Where have you brought us?

1338
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:35,600
Hurry up, we need to get there
before the moon rises.

1339
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:36,600
Whose place is this?

1340
01:24:36,680 --> 01:24:37,560
How does it matter?

1341
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:38,640
It's a safe place.

1342
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:39,600
Panda suggested this.

1343
01:24:39,680 --> 01:24:41,120
Unlock it.

1344
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:50,360
The place is indeed good.
But what if I still break out?

1345
01:24:50,440 --> 01:24:52,520
- Then?
- That's what the chain is for.

1346
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:56,760
Now we'll chain you up here,
and release you at dawn.

1347
01:24:57,200 --> 01:24:59,680
If the chain snaps
it'll be a problem.

1348
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:02,320
Bhaski, you become a wolf,
not the Hulk.

1349
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:04,480
- That was savage.
- Shut up!

1350
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:06,616
- Why are you stripping?
- All my clothes are ripped.

1351
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:07,640
Let me save these.

1352
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:10,960
Chain me up.

1353
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:12,560
Do it!

1354
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:18,000
Do you want a goat or something?
For a midnight snack.

1355
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:20,880
Hey!

1356
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:23,120
What is Kaso doing here?

1357
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:26,040
I guess Panda double-crossed us.
He suggested this place.

1358
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:28,160
Mr. Kaso...

1359
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:30,760
Well...

1360
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:32,520
We're starting the project soon.

1361
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:35,040
So we came to scout a location
for the timber mill.

1362
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:36,080
Wearing undies?

1363
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:38,960
- This is just...
- Sure! Check the place out.

1364
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:40,000
Sir...

1365
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:42,960
- Hey! What are you doing!
- Sir, please!

1366
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:45,400
- Open it!
- Do you know who we are?

1367
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:47,080
You're just a forest officer.

1368
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:49,136
We're the Lutyens'. You'll be hearing
from the Minister himself!

1369
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:50,760
I suspected you right from the start.

1370
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:52,840
- What?
- Today I will prove it.

1371
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:54,680
- What! Are you crazy?
- What doubts?

1372
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:56,240
Kaso, unlock this.
Let's talk it out.

1373
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:58,560
The mystery of this virus
will be solved today.

1374
01:25:58,640 --> 01:25:59,840
- The virus!
- What virus?

1375
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:02,040
This entire fiasco is about money, right?

1376
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:04,320
There's a lot of money in this project.

1377
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:07,200
Neri and Prakash are gone.
You'll get the entire cut for the timber.

1378
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:08,200
Let's do the deal!

1379
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:10,800
Do you outsiders think
we locals are fools?

1380
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:13,440
- No.
- I will seal the deal with Bagga, himself.

1381
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:16,000
Hey, mister! Please unlock us!

1382
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:17,880
Oh, man!
Jomin, talk to him!

1383
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:20,160
Sir, it's not what you think!

1384
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:22,880
Sir, please unlock it...

1385
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:31,120
And now he's singing!

1386
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:34,880
- Let him try. His arms are longer.
- Sir, open it.

1387
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:38,080
- No! No!
- What are you doing!

1388
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:40,800
- No! No!
- He's shooting a video!

1389
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:43,320
- We gotta go. We'll go viral!
- But where do we go?

1390
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:45,000
- We must get out.
- How?

1391
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:47,560
- Jomin, help us out.
- You must know this place!

1392
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:49,400
- Look there!
- Look upstairs!

1393
01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:55,720
- Call up Panda!
- I'm on it.

1394
01:26:57,720 --> 01:26:58,720
There's nothing here.

1395
01:26:58,760 --> 01:26:59,880
Nothing here either!

1396
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:02,160
- Anything?
- No!

1397
01:27:02,240 --> 01:27:03,960
- There's no signal here.
- What!

1398
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:07,040
- Stop it!
- Just keep looking.

1399
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:11,400
Hey!

1400
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:16,200
Bhaski, no! You'll get hurt.

1401
01:27:16,280 --> 01:27:17,880
There's no exit!

1402
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:28,920
Bhaski!

1403
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:32,720
Hey! Did you hear that?

1404
01:27:35,640 --> 01:27:36,880
- Hey!
- Bhaski, don't look.

1405
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:38,600
Don't look, Bhaski.

1406
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:40,200
- Hey, Bhaski.
- Bhaski, look here.

1407
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:43,320
- Look at me. His stomach is hurting.
- Bhaski! Bhaski!

1408
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:45,800
- Bhaski, listen!
- Help me!

1409
01:27:45,880 --> 01:27:48,160
- Brother!
- Let's go!

1410
01:27:48,240 --> 01:27:50,040
Brother?

1411
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:52,080
- Get the chain!
- What!

1412
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:54,680
- Get the chain!
- Please control!

1413
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:56,200
Jomin, pull!

1414
01:27:56,280 --> 01:27:57,920
You pull!

1415
01:27:58,200 --> 01:28:00,160
- This way!
- Okay!

1416
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:02,520
Tightly! Tightly!

1417
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:05,640
Go that way!

1418
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:08,640
Breathe in, breathe out...

1419
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:10,240
Breathe in...
Very good!

1420
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:13,120
- I can't do it! No way!
- You can! Try harder!

1421
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:15,360
Bhaski, mind over matter...

1422
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:16,960
Easy! Hang in there!

1423
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:23,720
Lord, deliver us from all evil!

1424
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:26,200
Lord, deliver us from all evil!

1425
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:29,640
- Lord, deliver us from...
- Get a hold of yourself.

1426
01:28:36,440 --> 01:28:37,840
Where the hell are you going?

1427
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:39,360
Mister! Mister!

1428
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:45,960
He might kill us!
Please, mister!

1429
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:48,200
- Open the gate! Please!
- Please, mister!

1430
01:28:48,280 --> 01:28:50,480
I'm still a bachelor!
I don't want to die!

1431
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:52,520
- Please, mister!
- I'll do anything you say!

1432
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:54,880
- Please, mister!
- Sir! Sir!

1433
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:56,176
Please be human, for God's sake!

1434
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:57,720
Let us go, sir.

1435
01:28:58,640 --> 01:29:00,080
- Get away!
- Please...

1436
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:01,840
- Get away!
- Let us go...

1437
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:09,400
A live werewolf transformation.

1438
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:14,280
His bones are snapping!

1439
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:36,080
Look! Look, the tail!

1440
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:04,920
Bhaski...

1441
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:12,600
Jomin!

1442
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:18,600
This is your last chance to do Kung-Fu.

1443
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:20,480
Bhaski!

1444
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:29,880
Shoo! Shoo! Get away!

1445
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:33,680
- Jomin! Help!
- Get over here! Hurry, JD!

1446
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:37,480
- No!
- Look!

1447
01:30:37,960 --> 01:30:39,040
- Bhaskar!
- Bhaski!

1448
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:42,320
Bhaski!
I know you're in there!

1449
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:45,360
It's me! Your cousin JD!
Will you really eat me?

1450
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:46,960
Bhaski, stay!

1451
01:30:48,920 --> 01:30:49,920
No!

1452
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:51,760
Mr. Wolf, are you hungry?

1453
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:56,000
There's lots to eat outside.
Deer, pigs...

1454
01:30:56,280 --> 01:30:59,000
Even those Mithuns.
Please let me go.

1455
01:30:59,080 --> 01:31:01,280
Stand back, you heartless animal!

1456
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:04,920
Do you recognise me, Brother?
No...

1457
01:31:05,680 --> 01:31:07,280
I'm an idiot!

1458
01:31:07,640 --> 01:31:11,080
I'm a stupid a**hole
for coming here with you!

1459
01:31:12,160 --> 01:31:14,480
Take all my money and let me go!

1460
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:17,880
I'm your uncle's son!
Eat Jomin if you're hungry.

1461
01:31:17,960 --> 01:31:19,920
Shut up, JD!
Are you crazy?

1462
01:31:20,240 --> 01:31:22,160
Mummy!

1463
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:25,360
Hey! Hey! No, Bhaski!

1464
01:31:26,600 --> 01:31:27,920
I'm your partner!

1465
01:31:28,120 --> 01:31:30,000
Don't listen to him, Bhaski!

1466
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:35,240
No, Bhaski...
Please!

1467
01:31:35,880 --> 01:31:37,920
I want to live, Bhaski!

1468
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:04,520
Hallelujah! Praise the Lord!

1469
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:08,520
Praise the Lord!

1470
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:11,040
Are you okay, buddy?

1471
01:33:11,640 --> 01:33:12,680
Get lost!

1472
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:44,280
Janardan!

1473
01:33:45,240 --> 01:33:48,200
That rascal Panda
must've tipped off Kaso.

1474
01:33:51,480 --> 01:33:54,040
- Jo, what are you doing?
- He's leaving.

1475
01:33:55,960 --> 01:33:57,240
What happened?

1476
01:33:57,720 --> 01:34:01,000
What happened?
I'm talking to you.

1477
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:03,160
I tried, bro. Your turn.

1478
01:34:03,240 --> 01:34:05,200
Hey, Jo!
Just look at me!

1479
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:07,320
- Jo, please stop!
- Why should I?

1480
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:09,000
Why?

1481
01:34:09,240 --> 01:34:10,880
You almost ate me last night!

1482
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:12,320
- Last night...
- Stop it, pal!

1483
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:14,360
The local folks are right!

1484
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:16,000
You outsiders are the virus.

1485
01:34:16,200 --> 01:34:17,840
You are leeching off the local folks.

1486
01:34:18,040 --> 01:34:20,600
You were about to do
the same to me last night.

1487
01:34:21,160 --> 01:34:24,480
Animals don't know if their prey
belongs to Delhi or Arunachal.

1488
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:27,320
- You know that I have no ill feelings.
- You do, Bhaski.

1489
01:34:27,640 --> 01:34:29,840
Not just you, even he does.

1490
01:34:30,640 --> 01:34:33,800
Even everyone out there feel the same way.

1491
01:34:34,360 --> 01:34:37,720
JD discriminates against me casually
over every little thing!

1492
01:34:38,120 --> 01:34:39,840
Even you laugh at his jokes.

1493
01:34:40,440 --> 01:34:42,280
Do you think I don't feel bad?

1494
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:45,800
He's been pestering me
to show him Kung-Fu.

1495
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:47,240
Want to see Kung-Fu now?

1496
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:49,880
I don't know Kung-Fu.

1497
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:55,080
For you folks, all of North East
is a Shaolin temple

1498
01:34:55,680 --> 01:34:58,440
and we are Jackie Chan
and Bruce Lee's children!

1499
01:34:58,520 --> 01:34:59,600
- Right?
- No...

1500
01:34:59,680 --> 01:35:02,520
When people call us Chinese
in our own country

1501
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:05,280
it feels so bad!

1502
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:08,080
It really hurts!

1503
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:09,400
Brother...

1504
01:35:09,480 --> 01:35:12,080
And JD, if one's Hindi is weak

1505
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:14,960
it doesn't make him any less Indian!

1506
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:18,000
- Come on, pal.
- Jo, please don't...

1507
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:19,520
Jo, please hear me out.

1508
01:35:21,320 --> 01:35:22,560
Stop him.

1509
01:35:24,360 --> 01:35:27,440
Jo! Jo, please wait!

1510
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:29,640
Jo, please hear me out once.

1511
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:33,000
That was some lecture!

1512
01:35:34,640 --> 01:35:35,840
Do you know what the truth is?

1513
01:35:36,360 --> 01:35:38,000
People have this insecurity.

1514
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:41,080
When someone looks different,
or has a weakness

1515
01:35:41,200 --> 01:35:44,640
or is from a different community
people pick on them.

1516
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:48,800
Even I was called many names.
Stupid, nerd, foolish...

1517
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:50,880
People used to bully me a lot.

1518
01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:54,160
But hearing you today
made me feel like a bully, myself.

1519
01:35:55,360 --> 01:35:57,720
But you know what matters ultimately?
Friendship.

1520
01:35:58,680 --> 01:36:00,440
I have two close friends.

1521
01:36:02,360 --> 01:36:04,040
They instilled me with confidence.

1522
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:06,080
They said I'm not stupid.

1523
01:36:07,120 --> 01:36:09,880
And today, I'm preparing
for IAS exams.

1524
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:12,120
I don't know if I'll be able to crack it.

1525
01:36:14,160 --> 01:36:15,560
Please forgive me.

1526
01:36:16,040 --> 01:36:18,040
Bhaski needs us.
Slap me if you want.

1527
01:36:18,120 --> 01:36:20,880
- No.
- Yes, go ahead. Slap him.

1528
01:36:23,320 --> 01:36:24,400
Slap me, too, bro.

1529
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:27,600
- No, Bhaski..
- Sorry, Jo.

1530
01:36:28,640 --> 01:36:31,800
And if I really had to pick between
the two of you.

1531
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:34,800
I would always eat you.

1532
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:38,720
Because animals don't eat trash.

1533
01:36:40,160 --> 01:36:41,640
What crap!

1534
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:45,080
So I'm trash?
Don't hug me. No, thanks!

1535
01:36:45,160 --> 01:36:47,560
- Come on.
- Mr. JD!

1536
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:52,160
Mr. Bhaskar...
Do you remember the Ojha?

1537
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:55,680
- What happened to him?
- Well...

1538
01:36:55,800 --> 01:36:56,800
I found him.

1539
01:37:05,800 --> 01:37:06,880
What is he saying?

1540
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:08,080
He asked you to shut up.

1541
01:37:10,760 --> 01:37:11,880
He says that...

1542
01:37:11,960 --> 01:37:15,560
Humans and forests have shared
a special pact since centuries.

1543
01:37:16,840 --> 01:37:19,640
That neither would harm the other.

1544
01:37:20,040 --> 01:37:23,000
But when humans break that pact

1545
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:25,640
and cut down the forests

1546
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:27,760
the virus infects them.

1547
01:37:32,040 --> 01:37:36,000
The jungle will always live
in some part of the human mind.

1548
01:37:36,640 --> 01:37:39,560
The virus unleashes that part.

1549
01:37:40,720 --> 01:37:44,520
Then that person forgets
all civilised behaviour

1550
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:48,120
manners and inhibitions
and turns into a wild beast.

1551
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:52,120
The virus is the chief of the jungle.

1552
01:37:53,200 --> 01:37:56,400
It infects others
and creates soldiers for itself.

1553
01:37:57,520 --> 01:37:59,400
And when the time comes

1554
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:04,160
he chooses one among the soldiers
to be the new guardian.

1555
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:08,000
How can a person infected
by the virus return to normal?

1556
01:38:08,640 --> 01:38:10,600
- Ask him that.
- Yes, we better.

1557
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:29,280
On a moon-less night,
the main virus visits the spot

1558
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:31,680
where it infected its prey.

1559
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:36,720
If it bites its prey again
at the same part of the body

1560
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:39,160
he can be cured.

1561
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:40,440
- What!
- What!

1562
01:38:41,360 --> 01:38:43,200
Grandpa here is asking him
to get bitten again?

1563
01:38:51,560 --> 01:38:53,296
So you'll voluntarily
get your head bitten off?

1564
01:38:53,320 --> 01:38:54,600
More like my butt.

1565
01:38:54,840 --> 01:38:57,000
- Are you crazy?
- Haven't you seen it in movies?

1566
01:38:57,200 --> 01:38:58,816
When one gets a head injury
he loses memory.

1567
01:38:58,840 --> 01:39:00,416
But when he's hit again
at the same spot it comes back.

1568
01:39:00,440 --> 01:39:02,560
- It's the same idea.
- I don't believe you guys.

1569
01:39:02,640 --> 01:39:04,160
No, you have to believe us.

1570
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:06,760
Fine. Let's assume the Ojha is right.

1571
01:39:07,560 --> 01:39:09,760
Still what's the guarantee
that the animal will show up?

1572
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:12,280
And what's the guarantee
that it will only bite his bum?

1573
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:14,720
I agree, there's no guarantee.
So should I just quit?

1574
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:16,440
Don't my feelings matter?

1575
01:39:16,520 --> 01:39:18,840
Am I supposed to go on eating people

1576
01:39:19,200 --> 01:39:20,480
I don't want any of this!

1577
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:22,840
I want to be free of this curse.
Do you understand?

1578
01:39:22,920 --> 01:39:27,160
And we must create an arm our such that
the wolf bites only his bum.

1579
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:29,000
- And he stays alive.
- Yeah.

1580
01:39:29,160 --> 01:39:32,120
Where can we find such an arm our?
You're the animal expert.

1581
01:39:32,360 --> 01:39:33,800
Anika, aren't you one?

1582
01:39:34,120 --> 01:39:35,400
Will you help us or not?

1583
01:39:36,920 --> 01:39:38,040
Please.

1584
01:39:45,720 --> 01:39:50,680
"Faith is a strange thing,"

1585
01:39:50,760 --> 01:39:55,400
"Why do I trust you blindly?"

1586
01:39:55,480 --> 01:40:01,000
"What is this bond forming between us?"

1587
01:40:01,080 --> 01:40:03,400
"I don't know."

1588
01:40:03,480 --> 01:40:07,400
"You don't belong to me..."

1589
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:13,280
"You don't belong to me..."

1590
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:15,720
"You don't belong to me..."

1591
01:40:15,800 --> 01:40:18,120
"Yet you mean the world to me."

1592
01:40:18,200 --> 01:40:21,480
"You don't belong to me..."

1593
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:26,080
What are you thinking?

1594
01:40:27,320 --> 01:40:29,240
What do you think?
Why me?

1595
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:31,360
Why did this virus infect only me?

1596
01:40:33,640 --> 01:40:36,880
Maybe it has never seen
such a handsome young man before.

1597
01:40:38,160 --> 01:40:40,320
No, seriously.
Why me?

1598
01:40:42,280 --> 01:40:44,920
I mean, you wanted to cut down the forest.

1599
01:40:45,480 --> 01:40:47,880
So maybe that wolf wanted to kill you

1600
01:40:48,280 --> 01:40:49,600
and you escaped accidentally.

1601
01:40:50,520 --> 01:40:53,840
Or maybe it wants to turn the destroyer
into the saviour.

1602
01:40:59,080 --> 01:41:00,800
You wanted to go sightseeing with me,
right?

1603
01:41:03,440 --> 01:41:04,840
I have a favourite spot.

1604
01:41:06,120 --> 01:41:07,600
Let's go there before the big bite?

1605
01:41:21,360 --> 01:41:23,680
"You don't belong to me..."

1606
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:26,240
"Yet you mean the world to me."

1607
01:41:26,320 --> 01:41:28,600
"You don't belong to me..."

1608
01:41:28,680 --> 01:41:31,040
"Yet you mean the world to me."

1609
01:41:31,120 --> 01:41:35,840
"How did you do this?"

1610
01:41:36,040 --> 01:41:40,840
"You've managed to steal my heart away."

1611
01:41:40,920 --> 01:41:45,440
"I know, but yet I don't get it."

1612
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:50,640
"You are my sunshine."

1613
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:53,080
"You don't belong to me..."

1614
01:41:53,160 --> 01:41:57,040
"Yet you mean the world to me."

1615
01:41:57,440 --> 01:41:59,840
"Let me belong to you, my love."

1616
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:02,320
"Let me belong to you, my love."

1617
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:07,280
"I want you to dwell in my heart,
my love."

1618
01:42:29,440 --> 01:42:34,040
"Your touch has made my dull life"

1619
01:42:34,400 --> 01:42:38,800
"Bright and colourful."

1620
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:43,560
"When I move towards you..."

1621
01:42:44,240 --> 01:42:47,120
"I feel like I am soaring."

1622
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:51,880
"This world holds no meaning anymore,"

1623
01:42:52,040 --> 01:42:57,080
"You are the only one I want."

1624
01:42:57,160 --> 01:43:01,720
"I am in so deep that I
don't know how to uncomplicate it."

1625
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:09,480
"I find truth in your
words even when they're false."

1626
01:43:09,560 --> 01:43:11,840
"You don't belong to me..."

1627
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:16,560
"Yet you mean the world to me."

1628
01:43:26,240 --> 01:43:28,280
"Let me belong to you, my love."

1629
01:43:28,360 --> 01:43:30,360
"Let me belong to you, my love."

1630
01:43:30,440 --> 01:43:35,040
"Yet you mean the world to me."

1631
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:38,400
"Let me belong to you, my love."

1632
01:43:41,720 --> 01:43:45,400
"Let me belong to you."

1633
01:43:45,800 --> 01:43:48,280
- Isn't it beautiful?
- It is indeed.

1634
01:43:48,360 --> 01:43:50,560
"Let me belong to you."

1635
01:43:50,840 --> 01:43:54,560
This place makes me want to turn
into an animal and stay here forever.

1636
01:43:55,400 --> 01:43:56,680
Then stay.

1637
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:02,000
No.

1638
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:04,600
I need to go back.

1639
01:44:06,360 --> 01:44:09,160
After getting rid of this virus
I'll go home.

1640
01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:53,640
If I survive, we'll meet at the clinic.

1641
01:44:54,360 --> 01:44:55,640
Take care of yourself.

1642
01:44:56,200 --> 01:44:57,480
Hmm. Come on.

1643
01:45:01,080 --> 01:45:02,520
You are the best hunters.

1644
01:45:02,760 --> 01:45:05,840
We must nab that animal at any cost.

1645
01:45:06,320 --> 01:45:10,080
And most important,
unless you are in lethal danger

1646
01:45:10,280 --> 01:45:11,640
do not shoot it dead.

1647
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:25,280
Hey! Hurry up!

1648
01:45:35,480 --> 01:45:38,800
The virus is done for!
I bet on it!

1649
01:45:44,280 --> 01:45:46,880
Your account does not have
sufficient balance.

1650
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:48,840
To avoid low balance...

1651
01:46:06,760 --> 01:46:08,640
Brother, is this the place?
Smell it.

1652
01:46:10,520 --> 01:46:12,160
Yes, this is the wretched place.

1653
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:15,120
- Jo, is everything set?
- Everything is set.

1654
01:46:15,880 --> 01:46:17,960
- Come on!
- Keep walking...

1655
01:46:18,320 --> 01:46:20,160
Keep walking...

1656
01:46:20,240 --> 01:46:23,000
- Hurry up! It'll be dark soon.
- Keep walking...

1657
01:46:42,640 --> 01:46:44,360
- What are you doing?
- No, let me check.

1658
01:46:46,280 --> 01:46:48,600
The neck is more important than the bum.

1659
01:46:49,960 --> 01:46:52,080
I have the power!

1660
01:46:57,920 --> 01:47:02,400
The number you have dialed
is unreachable.

1661
01:47:18,440 --> 01:47:19,560
What's wrong, Bhaski?

1662
01:47:21,800 --> 01:47:23,120
This doesn't feel right.

1663
01:47:24,120 --> 01:47:25,280
No, everything is right.

1664
01:47:25,520 --> 01:47:28,040
The arm our is proper.
The rope is ready.

1665
01:47:28,120 --> 01:47:29,920
Even our outpost is ready.
It's all good.

1666
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:32,640
No, bro.

1667
01:47:33,640 --> 01:47:36,440
So far I thought I was the hero
in this story

1668
01:47:36,640 --> 01:47:37,800
and the wolf was the villain.

1669
01:47:38,680 --> 01:47:39,760
But it's the other way.

1670
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:42,080
Between the wolf and I

1671
01:47:42,520 --> 01:47:43,760
the wolf is the hero.

1672
01:47:44,640 --> 01:47:46,960
I don't care who's the hero.

1673
01:47:47,240 --> 01:47:48,800
I just want my cousin back!

1674
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:50,496
- This isn't the time for sentiment.
- I'm not...

1675
01:47:50,520 --> 01:47:52,240
- How will I face your dad?
- JD, hold on.

1676
01:47:52,320 --> 01:47:55,440
Bhaski, you and the wolf were doing
your respective jobs.

1677
01:47:55,960 --> 01:47:59,280
We just want you to become
a normal human again.

1678
01:47:59,720 --> 01:48:02,200
We'll debate about the morality later.

1679
01:48:02,960 --> 01:48:05,040
Just focus on this for now. Okay?

1680
01:48:05,240 --> 01:48:08,000
- Come on, hang.
- JD, we don't have much time.

1681
01:48:08,080 --> 01:48:10,320
- Yes, let's go soon. Come on.
- Come on.

1682
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:12,120
- Hurry up!
- There's the rope.

1683
01:48:15,880 --> 01:48:18,440
Pull! Pull!

1684
01:48:19,480 --> 01:48:20,480
Pull...

1685
01:48:20,560 --> 01:48:22,000
- Okay.
- It's fine.

1686
01:48:25,120 --> 01:48:27,520
Okay, Bhaski?
Pass me the knife.

1687
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:30,440
- Here.
- Get a smaller one.

1688
01:48:30,800 --> 01:48:32,640
- Take this.
- Hurry up!

1689
01:48:34,680 --> 01:48:36,840
One, two, three!

1690
01:48:52,160 --> 01:48:53,600
Give me your hand.

1691
01:49:09,960 --> 01:49:10,960
Crazy!

1692
01:49:15,040 --> 01:49:16,960
- Bhaski!
- Shh! Shh!

1693
01:49:23,640 --> 01:49:25,800
I see something over there.

1694
01:49:26,160 --> 01:49:28,160
Go to him! Go to him!

1695
01:49:38,840 --> 01:49:41,400
Lord, deliver us from all evil!

1696
01:49:41,560 --> 01:49:43,960
Lord, deliver us from all evil!

1697
01:49:44,040 --> 01:49:46,720
Lord, deliver us from all evil!

1698
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:49,680
Lord, deliver us from all evil!

1699
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:54,880
Lord, deliver us from all evil!

1700
01:49:55,000 --> 01:50:00,560
Lord, deliver us from all evil!

1701
01:50:01,520 --> 01:50:03,840
As soon as it bites him, shoot it!

1702
01:50:29,600 --> 01:50:31,600
- Why did you shoot?
- It wasn't me.

1703
01:50:36,840 --> 01:50:39,320
- Jo! JD!
- Bhaski!

1704
01:50:39,840 --> 01:50:42,040
- Hurry up!
- Come here.

1705
01:50:42,120 --> 01:50:43,800
- Come on.
- Hold it...

1706
01:50:44,280 --> 01:50:45,880
Hold it! Come on!

1707
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:49,280
Take this off quick!
Who fired the shot?

1708
01:50:49,360 --> 01:50:50,800
- It wasn't us.
- Not us.

1709
01:50:59,360 --> 01:51:00,400
It's over there.

1710
01:51:01,600 --> 01:51:03,280
Then you better follow it.

1711
01:51:03,440 --> 01:51:06,000
You must get bitten
before they kill you.

1712
01:51:06,080 --> 01:51:07,320
Come on.

1713
01:51:07,480 --> 01:51:09,800
This is your last chance.
Go, Bhaski!

1714
01:51:10,120 --> 01:51:11,440
Just go for it, Bhaski.

1715
01:52:39,920 --> 01:52:41,080
Anika!

1716
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:45,800
You!

1717
01:52:47,440 --> 01:52:48,680
It is me.

1718
01:52:50,520 --> 01:52:53,560
The virus, Yapum...

1719
01:52:55,480 --> 01:52:56,800
Whatever you call it...

1720
01:52:59,720 --> 01:53:02,120
JD! Jo! Help me!

1721
01:53:04,240 --> 01:53:06,840
So it was you who bit me?

1722
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:10,600
I wanted to kill you,
but you escaped.

1723
01:53:11,200 --> 01:53:13,400
And became like me even though
I didn't want it.

1724
01:53:15,320 --> 01:53:16,960
But what had I ever done to you?

1725
01:53:17,200 --> 01:53:17,920
I was just...

1726
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
The forest was going to be cut down
because of you.

1727
01:53:20,400 --> 01:53:22,400
And I couldn't let that happen.

1728
01:53:23,200 --> 01:53:25,960
I've been protecting these forests
for a 100 years.

1729
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:35,600
I could've killed you
if I wanted to.

1730
01:53:37,080 --> 01:53:41,040
But for some reason
I felt you were changing.

1731
01:53:42,160 --> 01:53:44,360
I cannot stay in one place for long.

1732
01:53:45,520 --> 01:53:48,360
So I thought maybe
I could leave you here in my stead

1733
01:53:49,720 --> 01:53:50,840
and go elsewhere.

1734
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:55,120
But I was wrong.

1735
01:53:58,960 --> 01:54:01,840
- Why didn't you tell me sooner?
- I wanted to.

1736
01:54:02,680 --> 01:54:04,280
But you were not ready for it.

1737
01:54:04,760 --> 01:54:06,000
You still aren't.

1738
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:09,040
Because Bhaskar,
what you think of as a curse

1739
01:54:09,960 --> 01:54:11,680
is a great responsibility.

1740
01:54:12,840 --> 01:54:14,240
You're better off as human.

1741
01:54:15,720 --> 01:54:17,360
You're not worthy of being an animal.

1742
01:54:22,440 --> 01:54:24,440
You want freedom from this curse, right?

1743
01:54:25,600 --> 01:54:27,040
You wanted to get bitten, right?

1744
01:54:30,240 --> 01:54:33,280
Come, let me bite you.

1745
01:54:43,440 --> 01:54:44,960
- No...
- Bhaski!

1746
01:54:45,360 --> 01:54:46,920
Bhaski! Bhaski!

1747
01:54:47,320 --> 01:54:49,000
- Bhaski!
- Bhaski!

1748
01:54:52,080 --> 01:54:53,680
- Bhaski!
- Bhaski!

1749
01:55:03,360 --> 01:55:06,120
Could he have gone there?
Bhaski!

1750
01:55:07,960 --> 01:55:09,640
Bhaski! Bhaski!

1751
01:55:10,560 --> 01:55:13,240
Are you okay?
Did you get bitten?

1752
01:55:14,480 --> 01:55:16,200
- What?
- Anika...

1753
01:55:17,520 --> 01:55:18,640
- What?
- What?

1754
01:55:18,840 --> 01:55:20,120
Anika is the virus.

1755
01:55:20,400 --> 01:55:21,880
- He's gone mad.
- Come on!

1756
01:55:21,960 --> 01:55:24,240
It was Anika who bit me
in the jungle.

1757
01:55:24,520 --> 01:55:25,560
Dr. Anika?

1758
01:55:26,280 --> 01:55:28,200
I suspected only men so far.

1759
01:55:28,520 --> 01:55:32,280
But we missed the fact that females
are the stronger sex in every specie.

1760
01:55:32,360 --> 01:55:33,520
Oh!

1761
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,240
So she's been guarding these forests
for a 100 years?

1762
01:56:17,200 --> 01:56:18,320
Yes.

1763
01:56:18,480 --> 01:56:20,080
And now, we must save her.

1764
01:56:20,480 --> 01:56:21,920
We must stop all of them.

1765
01:56:22,440 --> 01:56:25,400
But how?
There are so many of them.

1766
01:56:25,920 --> 01:56:29,680
In order to stop them
he must transform into a wolf.

1767
01:56:30,240 --> 01:56:33,160
Yes, bro.
Cities have enough heroes.

1768
01:56:33,400 --> 01:56:35,000
This time a jungle needs a hero.

1769
01:56:35,320 --> 01:56:37,440
Turn into a wolf, Brother.
I'll handle your dad.

1770
01:56:37,520 --> 01:56:38,960
Come on, do it.

1771
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:41,360
- Do it.
- Bhaski, you must do it.

1772
01:56:41,440 --> 01:56:43,560
- Come on.
- Just go for it!

1773
01:56:46,200 --> 01:56:48,160
- Attaboy!
- Yes.

1774
01:56:48,840 --> 01:56:50,360
Come on! Come on!

1775
01:56:56,400 --> 01:56:57,480
I can't do it.

1776
01:56:57,960 --> 01:57:00,680
- What happened?
- It's a moon-less night.

1777
01:57:01,520 --> 01:57:02,920
You are too demanding sometimes.

1778
01:57:03,480 --> 01:57:05,760
Here, a picture of the moon,
for inspiration.

1779
01:57:05,880 --> 01:57:07,120
Stop all this.

1780
01:57:07,640 --> 01:57:10,320
What do you need the moon for?
To break the Karva-Chauth fast?

1781
01:57:10,400 --> 01:57:11,440
No.

1782
01:57:11,520 --> 01:57:13,840
You're a shape-shifting wolf.
Okay?

1783
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:15,760
Go within and bring out the wolf.

1784
01:57:15,840 --> 01:57:17,040
Like this...

1785
01:57:17,400 --> 01:57:19,480
- You don't depend on the moon.
- True.

1786
01:57:19,560 --> 01:57:21,160
- Bring it from within.
- Yes.

1787
01:57:21,320 --> 01:57:23,440
- You're a self-reliant wolf.
- True.

1788
01:57:23,600 --> 01:57:25,000
Bhaski, you must do it.

1789
01:57:28,400 --> 01:57:30,120
Focus. Focus.

1790
01:57:33,280 --> 01:57:36,640
Good! Bravo!

1791
01:57:36,720 --> 01:57:38,360
Excellent, Bhaski!

1792
01:57:38,440 --> 01:57:41,480
Come on! Come on!
Come on!

1793
01:57:42,520 --> 01:57:44,320
Come on, Bhaski!

1794
01:57:44,720 --> 01:57:47,280
- I still can't do it.
- Shame on your existence!

1795
01:57:47,640 --> 01:57:49,720
- Can't even transform.
- Make him angry.

1796
01:57:50,360 --> 01:57:53,120
- Come on, make him angry.
- Sorry, Bhaski!

1797
01:57:55,200 --> 01:57:57,960
- Hey! Easy there..
- Bhaski! Bhaski!

1798
01:57:58,480 --> 01:58:00,120
Look here...

1799
01:58:00,840 --> 01:58:04,880
Grab him! Become a wolf!
Become a wolf, you...

1800
01:58:04,960 --> 01:58:07,520
Don't you want to save the jungle?
Become a wolf!

1801
01:58:07,600 --> 01:58:10,240
Hit him! Hit him! Get angry!

1802
01:58:11,280 --> 01:58:12,360
Stop it, guys!

1803
01:58:12,440 --> 01:58:13,880
Enough! Enough!

1804
01:58:13,960 --> 01:58:16,200
- He needs this!
- Hey stop!

1805
01:58:16,280 --> 01:58:18,760
Stop this Royal Rumble!
Enough!

1806
01:58:21,040 --> 01:58:23,520
Remember what the Ojha had said?

1807
01:58:24,440 --> 01:58:27,160
The jungle is still alive
in some part of your brain.

1808
01:58:28,120 --> 01:58:29,200
Unlock that.

1809
01:58:30,520 --> 01:58:32,400
Awaken your primal instincts.

1810
01:58:33,520 --> 01:58:34,520
Feel them.

1811
01:58:36,440 --> 01:58:38,120
You and the jungle are one and the same.

1812
01:58:39,200 --> 01:58:40,280
Become one with it.

1813
01:58:41,400 --> 01:58:42,720
Realise it.

1814
01:58:44,080 --> 01:58:45,080
Smell it.

1815
01:58:46,040 --> 01:58:47,680
Wake up and smell the jungle.

1816
01:58:48,480 --> 01:58:49,720
This is yours.

1817
01:58:50,480 --> 01:58:54,560
It's all inside you.
This entire forest is yours.

1818
01:58:54,840 --> 01:58:57,480
Draw strength from the jungle.

1819
01:58:58,600 --> 01:59:02,800
This jungle is your house.
Claim it today.

1820
01:59:03,280 --> 01:59:04,320
Find it.

1821
01:59:04,760 --> 01:59:06,760
It's yours and yours alone.

1822
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,280
The virus!

1823
02:10:02,640 --> 02:10:05,120
Instead of building this highway
through the forest

1824
02:10:05,480 --> 02:10:07,360
we will now build
it along the forest boundary.

1825
02:10:07,800 --> 02:10:11,640
And we heartily welcome
this new decision.

1826
02:10:12,720 --> 02:10:15,640
Because there can be no development
at the cost of nature.

1827
02:10:16,400 --> 02:10:18,120
And we all have understood it.

1828
02:10:19,640 --> 02:10:22,760
A wise man had rightly said once...

1829
02:10:24,320 --> 02:10:26,440
If there's nature, there's progress.

1830
02:10:32,200 --> 02:10:34,240
'The ridge project is currently shut down'

1831
02:10:34,320 --> 02:10:38,320
'because many people working on
it suffered animal attacks.'

1832
02:10:38,760 --> 02:10:41,160
'Even Babanjeet Bagga,
the company chairman of this project'

1833
02:10:41,240 --> 02:10:43,960
'died in a terrible animal attack.'

1834
02:10:44,960 --> 02:10:47,640
It's fresh pork, especially for you.
Eat only this.

1835
02:10:48,800 --> 02:10:50,840
No more wandering outside
and eating people.

1836
02:10:50,920 --> 02:10:53,640
- But this is hardly enough.
- You need to stop overeating.

1837
02:10:53,880 --> 02:10:56,720
You ate Bagga yesterday.
He was a whole buffet in himself.

1838
02:10:57,280 --> 02:10:58,800
I can only spare one more piece.

1839
02:11:00,760 --> 02:11:01,840
Here.

1840
02:11:02,280 --> 02:11:03,320
- Okay?
- Yes.

1841
02:11:03,440 --> 02:11:07,320
South Delhi Ridge's forested areas act as
the lungs of Delhi city among others.'

1842
02:11:07,400 --> 02:11:07,880
Who is it?

1843
02:11:07,960 --> 02:11:10,241
'In spite of protests,
they want to cut down the forest, '

1844
02:11:10,280 --> 02:11:10,960
Stay right here.

1845
02:11:11,040 --> 02:11:12,520
'And build an industrial plant.'

1846
02:11:30,320 --> 02:11:32,320
What are you staring at?

1847
02:11:34,280 --> 02:11:36,440
Don't you recognise us?
It's me!

1848
02:11:36,920 --> 02:11:38,080
Vicky.

1849
02:11:38,160 --> 02:11:41,560
We've been looking for you more
than people look up things on Google.

1850
02:11:45,040 --> 02:11:47,520
Janna! Janna! Janna!

1851
02:11:47,600 --> 02:11:50,640
- I missed you guys so much!
- Stop your drama.

1852
02:11:51,200 --> 02:11:53,360
- We called you so many times.
- Sorry, guys.

1853
02:11:53,440 --> 02:11:56,280
I used to get seizures.
People thought I was cursed.

1854
02:11:56,360 --> 02:11:58,880
So mom sent me here
and made me delete all contacts.

1855
02:11:58,960 --> 02:12:01,200
She made me block your numbers.

1856
02:12:01,280 --> 02:12:03,160
You forget your friends for a woman?

1857
02:12:03,560 --> 02:12:04,680
She's my mother, pal.

1858
02:12:05,640 --> 02:12:07,520
- Sorry.
- Janna..

1859
02:12:08,040 --> 02:12:10,760
Try and be a good friend at least now.
Okay?

1860
02:12:11,400 --> 02:12:13,120
Only you can find her now.

1861
02:12:13,600 --> 02:12:14,760
Who?

1862
02:12:16,360 --> 02:12:17,560
Stree!

1863
02:12:19,840 --> 02:12:21,640
Her effect still lingers inside you.

1864
02:12:21,920 --> 02:12:23,200
You still get seizures, right?

1865
02:12:23,840 --> 02:12:24,840
Yes?

1866
02:12:26,040 --> 02:12:27,080
But how will I find her?

1867
02:12:27,160 --> 02:12:28,080
Why is it always up to me to find her?!

1868
02:12:28,160 --> 02:12:29,400
But how do I, Vicky...

1869
02:12:31,600 --> 02:12:33,360
- Did you hear that?
- No.

1870
02:12:33,680 --> 02:12:35,560
- Someone's in here!
- What sound?

1871
02:12:35,920 --> 02:12:38,360
Are you enjoying in private?

1872
02:12:38,440 --> 02:12:40,680
- Who is it?
- A special friend, huh?

1873
02:12:40,760 --> 02:12:43,440
- No...
- Introduce us, too.

1874
02:12:43,520 --> 02:12:45,920
We want to meet her.
Where is she?

1875
02:12:46,240 --> 02:12:48,480
Not here! It's coming from over there.

1876
02:12:48,560 --> 02:12:51,320
- Wow, Janna!
- No, pal.

1877
02:12:51,400 --> 02:12:54,280
- Tinted room!
- Hear me out...

1878
02:12:54,360 --> 02:12:57,120
- Vicky! Here's his lady...
- Don't go in there!

1879
02:12:57,200 --> 02:13:00,240
It's my uncle's room.
Please don't...

1880
02:13:06,320 --> 02:13:08,080
They're my friends.

1881
02:13:08,480 --> 02:13:09,560
They're my friends.

1882
02:13:10,920 --> 02:13:11,920
They're my friends.
