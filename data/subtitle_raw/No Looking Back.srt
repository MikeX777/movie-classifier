1
00:02:59,385 --> 00:03:01,216
Thanks, sweetheart.

2
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:20,889
<i>Hey, babe, it's me. Listen, I'm gonna
do the double shift tonight...</i>

3
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:24,292
<i>...so I won't be home till morning.
I'll try back later.</i>

4
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:28,433
<i>Oh, hey, I got you some flowers.
I hope you like them. Love you.</i>

5
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:31,430
<i>Hey, Claudia, it's Missy.
I just got the sonogram done.</i>

6
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:35,004
<i>You guys gotta come over and see it.
Okay. Call me. Bye.</i>

7
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:37,273
<i>Claudia, it's Kelly.</i>

8
00:04:37,476 --> 00:04:39,910
<i>Don't forget to go food shopping
for Mom this week.</i>

9
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:42,570
<i>And don't forget the cigarettes.
Talk to you.</i>

10
00:05:26,055 --> 00:05:27,852
Thanks a lot.

11
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:36,513
Hey, Ma?

12
00:06:37,922 --> 00:06:40,015
Hey, Mom, are you home?

13
00:06:53,203 --> 00:06:57,367
-I guess you got the check I sent?
-Yeah. Yeah, thanks.

14
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,906
I'll-- I'll pay you back
in a couple of weeks.

15
00:07:01,076 --> 00:07:02,907
Yeah, I won't hold my breath.

16
00:07:03,111 --> 00:07:05,636
So is this a friendly visit
or are you home for good?

17
00:07:05,814 --> 00:07:08,442
No, don't worry, don't worry.
It's just a little visit.

18
00:07:08,617 --> 00:07:11,450
Yeah? What happened? Fired again?

19
00:07:11,787 --> 00:07:14,152
No, no, this time-- This time I quit.

20
00:07:14,622 --> 00:07:17,284
Oh, good for you.

21
00:07:17,658 --> 00:07:21,025
Listen, I'm not gonna stand
for your bullshit this time, Charles.

22
00:07:22,129 --> 00:07:25,121
The last three years have been
very peaceful here without you.

23
00:07:25,533 --> 00:07:28,502
Act like an adult or you're out
on your ass. You understand?

24
00:07:29,336 --> 00:07:32,100
Yeah, yeah. I understand.

25
00:07:34,174 --> 00:07:37,234
And get that goddamn car
off my lawn too.

26
00:07:41,114 --> 00:07:44,173
And don't touch
any of my beers either.

27
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,461
So, Claud,
when did you hear about this?

28
00:08:04,669 --> 00:08:07,001
This afternoon at the diner.
Alice Smith told me.

29
00:08:07,171 --> 00:08:08,695
-Who's Alice Smith?
-Alice Smith.

30
00:08:08,873 --> 00:08:10,704
That slut that lives
across the street.

31
00:08:10,942 --> 00:08:12,636
Teresa, don't hold that against her.

32
00:08:12,809 --> 00:08:16,245
As far as I'm concerned, there aren't
enough chicks around like her.

33
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,579
What?

34
00:08:18,782 --> 00:08:20,272
I wonder if he's home for good.

35
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:23,317
Did Happy Legs say
he was home for good?

36
00:08:23,487 --> 00:08:27,149
We really didn't talk about it, Goldie.
She asked me if I knew he was home.

37
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:29,385
Does he know about you guys?

38
00:08:30,459 --> 00:08:32,359
I have no idea.

39
00:08:33,362 --> 00:08:36,854
-You think maybe he'd be pissed?
-I don't give a shit what he thinks.

40
00:08:37,033 --> 00:08:40,628
Come on, you know the guy since
first grade. Give him a break already.

41
00:08:40,803 --> 00:08:43,032
Are you kidding?
This guy's always been a mutt.

42
00:08:43,204 --> 00:08:45,866
He's trying to bang any skank
he can get his hands on.

43
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:49,101
Even so, I think somebody
should tell him.

44
00:08:49,678 --> 00:08:51,771
I don't give a shit who tells him.
Tell him.

45
00:08:51,946 --> 00:08:53,811
Claudia, what do you think?

46
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:57,017
Yeah, probably.

47
00:08:57,618 --> 00:09:02,612
All right, I'll go by his house
tomorrow after work. I'll go see him.

48
00:09:03,123 --> 00:09:05,523
Mike, come by with me.

49
00:09:05,693 --> 00:09:07,854
Fine. You want me to tell him,
I'll tell him.

50
00:09:08,028 --> 00:09:09,518
Happy now, you pain in the ass?

51
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:13,665
-I just think it's the right thing.
-Congratulations, Huck Finn.

52
00:09:13,866 --> 00:09:16,061
-Teresa, can I get another drink?
-In a minute.

53
00:09:16,235 --> 00:09:20,228
Teresa, I'll take one too.
And put it on Claudia's tab.

54
00:09:45,229 --> 00:09:46,696
Hey, nice car, man.

55
00:09:46,897 --> 00:09:50,060
Just make sure you scumbags
keep your hands off it.

56
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:13,413
-Hey, Michael, what's happening, man?
-How you doing?

57
00:10:13,589 --> 00:10:16,251
I hear you're home for a week
and nobody hears from you.

58
00:10:16,425 --> 00:10:18,586
Yeah, look,
I was gonna call you guys...

59
00:10:18,761 --> 00:10:23,323
...but I figured I'd run into you
sooner or later. So, what's up?

60
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:26,467
Nothing. I hear you're home,
I figured I'd come by, say hello.

61
00:10:26,634 --> 00:10:29,569
You gonna invite me in,
or are we gonna freeze our asses off?

62
00:10:29,737 --> 00:10:31,898
Yeah. Come on in.

63
00:10:36,711 --> 00:10:39,304
-Hey, Ma, you remember Michael, eh?
-Hey, Mrs. Ryan.

64
00:10:41,214 --> 00:10:42,943
Hey. How you doing?

65
00:10:44,718 --> 00:10:48,415
-What's up, man? Everything all right?
-Yeah. Everything's fine.

66
00:10:48,588 --> 00:10:50,522
Man, this place hasn't changed much.

67
00:10:50,757 --> 00:10:54,954
Yeah, my mom hasn't gotten around
to hiring the new interior decorator, so--

68
00:10:55,127 --> 00:10:58,187
I saw the Buick, I can't believe
you got that running again.

69
00:10:58,364 --> 00:11:00,764
Yeah, well. I still see
you're driving the Impala.

70
00:11:00,966 --> 00:11:02,866
I can't believe
that's still on the road.

71
00:11:03,035 --> 00:11:05,003
After you left,
I got a decent mechanic.

72
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:09,006
So, what brings you back?
You miss home?

73
00:11:09,174 --> 00:11:12,371
Did I miss home or something?
Is there something here to miss?

74
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,475
Hey, fuck you.

75
00:11:15,046 --> 00:11:17,537
So, what's the occasion?
You got any work lined up?

76
00:11:17,749 --> 00:11:20,217
Yeah, yeah, if you can believe it...

77
00:11:20,385 --> 00:11:23,353
...I'm back at Bugsy's pumping gas
a couple of days a week.

78
00:11:24,955 --> 00:11:26,946
So you seen anybody
since you're back?

79
00:11:27,157 --> 00:11:28,749
No, nobody.

80
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:32,060
Hoping to run into Claudia
if she's still around.

81
00:11:32,229 --> 00:11:35,562
-That's what I came here to talk about.
-Oh, why? What's up?

82
00:11:35,732 --> 00:11:37,722
Please don't tell me she's married.

83
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,198
Not exactly.

84
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:43,067
We're together now.

85
00:11:44,307 --> 00:11:46,172
What do you mean,
you're together now?

86
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:48,843
We're together, we live together.

87
00:11:49,011 --> 00:11:51,706
Probably gonna get married
this summer.

88
00:11:53,815 --> 00:11:55,680
No shit.

89
00:11:57,018 --> 00:12:00,010
How long--? How long's
that been going on?

90
00:12:00,188 --> 00:12:02,884
-About three years.
-Three years?

91
00:12:03,058 --> 00:12:04,855
You didn't waste any fucking time.

92
00:12:05,026 --> 00:12:07,220
You treated her like shit
and you took off.

93
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:08,884
At least I treat her good.

94
00:12:09,063 --> 00:12:11,156
You and Claudia.

95
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:13,461
I can't-- Can't picture that.

96
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:17,962
So, what's the deal,
you guys are engaged or something?

97
00:12:18,138 --> 00:12:19,366
Basically.

98
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:23,064
''Basically''? Hey, Michael,
how is one ''basically'' engaged?

99
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,511
Look, we both decided
we wanted to get married...

100
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:28,408
...but we haven't decided on a date.

101
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,448
So I guess you'd say
we're not officially engaged.

102
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:36,384
That's great man. Look, seriously,
no bullshit, I'm happy for you.

103
00:12:37,055 --> 00:12:38,750
-So you're cool with this?
-Look...

104
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,419
...me and her were over
a long time ago.

105
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,054
A long time ago, Charlie.

106
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:46,427
Yeah.

107
00:12:46,598 --> 00:12:49,589
-So no hard feelings?
-No, man.

108
00:12:50,434 --> 00:12:52,402
To old friends.

109
00:12:53,404 --> 00:12:55,235
Old friends.

110
00:13:02,647 --> 00:13:04,113
Hi, babe.

111
00:13:04,347 --> 00:13:07,282
-So how'd it go?
-What?

112
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:10,146
-What, you didn't go see him?
-Yeah.

113
00:13:10,353 --> 00:13:13,754
-And?
-And he's still an asshole.

114
00:13:13,957 --> 00:13:18,154
Back pumping gas at Bugsy's.
Really setting the world on fire.

115
00:13:23,732 --> 00:13:27,725
-So did you tell him about us?
-Yeah.

116
00:13:27,937 --> 00:13:31,100
-How did he react?
-He was cool with it.

117
00:14:01,834 --> 00:14:03,461
Hey, you.

118
00:14:04,136 --> 00:14:05,933
What's happening?

119
00:14:19,017 --> 00:14:23,454
-You here to eat?
-Yeah. Yeah, I'm here to eat.

120
00:14:24,356 --> 00:14:27,416
-You know what you want?
-Yeah.

121
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,788
Let me get a cheeseburger
and some fries, all right?

122
00:14:32,963 --> 00:14:34,692
That it?

123
00:14:34,865 --> 00:14:38,494
No. No, actually,
there's something I wanna ask you.

124
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:41,069
Can you sit down with me a second?

125
00:14:42,573 --> 00:14:44,973
You can't see I'm working here?

126
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:49,303
Hey, Claudia, it's not like this place
is exactly rocking, all right?

127
00:14:49,479 --> 00:14:52,471
Just sit down with me a second.
I'm not gonna bite you.

128
00:15:08,497 --> 00:15:09,862
So?

129
00:15:10,032 --> 00:15:14,401
So, you know, I just--
I wanted to come by and say I'm sorry...

130
00:15:14,568 --> 00:15:17,696
...for the way I just took off,
you know, when I left.

131
00:15:17,872 --> 00:15:19,840
So I'm sorry.

132
00:15:22,476 --> 00:15:24,774
-That's what you wanted to ask me?
-Yeah.

133
00:15:25,479 --> 00:15:29,346
Yeah, and also, you know, I mean,
I just wanted to see if, you know...

134
00:15:29,549 --> 00:15:31,380
...if you're happy with all this.

135
00:15:31,551 --> 00:15:35,282
Still living here, working in this
place, you know, your whole routine.

136
00:15:35,522 --> 00:15:37,581
-What business is that of yours?
-Come on.

137
00:15:37,757 --> 00:15:40,021
I've known you your whole life,
all right?

138
00:15:40,226 --> 00:15:42,990
I just can't see you
being okay with this.

139
00:15:43,696 --> 00:15:45,960
Well, it's not like
I'm gonna be here forever.

140
00:15:46,131 --> 00:15:48,497
Oh, really?
You see your friend back here?

141
00:15:48,867 --> 00:15:51,165
That's what she said too.
Now look at her.

142
00:15:51,336 --> 00:15:54,703
Another couple of months in this town
your hair's gonna turn blue too.

143
00:15:54,873 --> 00:15:56,670
You come here to eat
or to abuse me?

144
00:15:56,842 --> 00:15:59,639
No, look, look,
all I'm saying is, like...

145
00:15:59,811 --> 00:16:02,473
...what happened to all that stuff
you were gonna do?

146
00:16:03,047 --> 00:16:04,605
Remember what I used to call you?

147
00:16:04,782 --> 00:16:07,148
''Cloudia.'' You always
had your head in the clouds.

148
00:16:07,318 --> 00:16:09,946
Talking about getting out of here,
seeing the world.

149
00:16:10,121 --> 00:16:11,986
What happened to that girl?

150
00:16:14,091 --> 00:16:17,026
I was 18 years old and I grew up.
That's what happened.

151
00:16:17,461 --> 00:16:20,123
What about you?
You were the one with big plans...

152
00:16:20,297 --> 00:16:21,787
...big dreams. What happened?

153
00:16:21,965 --> 00:16:26,061
I didn't give up, all right?
It just didn't work out this time.

154
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:29,170
In a month or so,
I'm gonna get the hell out of here again.

155
00:16:29,338 --> 00:16:31,397
I'm not sticking around here.

156
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,433
So why did you bother
coming back home?

157
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,739
Honestly?

158
00:16:39,048 --> 00:16:40,948
Because I wanted to see you.

159
00:16:45,286 --> 00:16:48,983
Yeah, well, hey,
here I am in all my glory.

160
00:16:49,157 --> 00:16:50,522
Now what are you gonna do?

161
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,451
I'm thinking, you know, I'm thinking
if you're not so happy here...

162
00:16:54,629 --> 00:16:57,961
...then, you know, when I take off,
why don't you come with me?

163
00:16:58,632 --> 00:17:01,100
Remember? Like we always said
we were gonna do?

164
00:17:01,301 --> 00:17:04,759
Oh, yeah. Just like that, no big deal.

165
00:17:04,972 --> 00:17:06,303
You know what?

166
00:17:06,507 --> 00:17:09,203
I never said I wasn't happy, you did.

167
00:17:09,376 --> 00:17:11,172
Charlie, we've been here once before.

168
00:17:11,344 --> 00:17:13,039
We were kids,
it seemed so romantic.

169
00:17:13,212 --> 00:17:15,476
But it don't seem so romantic now,
does it?

170
00:17:15,648 --> 00:17:17,309
Why not?

171
00:17:18,284 --> 00:17:19,751
Because of Michael?

172
00:17:20,353 --> 00:17:22,287
Partly.

173
00:17:23,823 --> 00:17:26,154
And because I don't trust you.

174
00:17:26,358 --> 00:17:30,158
Remember, you have a habit of running
away when things get a little ugly.

175
00:17:30,529 --> 00:17:32,656
What are you talking about?
Talking about--?

176
00:17:33,465 --> 00:17:35,660
You talking about the abortion?

177
00:17:36,168 --> 00:17:37,795
Yeah.

178
00:17:39,004 --> 00:17:40,937
I'm talking about the abortion.

179
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:46,135
I stayed and made sure everything
was okay before I left, all right?

180
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:48,505
I even spoke to the guy
at the clinic.

181
00:17:49,747 --> 00:17:51,738
You even talked to that guy
at the clinic?

182
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:53,543
Well, that was mighty big of you.

183
00:17:53,751 --> 00:17:55,741
You know something?
Everything wasn't okay.

184
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,784
I needed you
and you weren't there.

185
00:17:59,823 --> 00:18:01,051
What wasn't okay?

186
00:18:01,224 --> 00:18:03,818
Look, that doesn't
even matter now, okay?

187
00:18:03,993 --> 00:18:07,827
But to answer your question, no.
I don't wanna go anywhere with you.

188
00:18:11,834 --> 00:18:13,392
So, what are you gonna do?

189
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:15,728
You're really gonna stay
and marry Michael?

190
00:18:15,904 --> 00:18:17,667
Yeah.

191
00:18:18,173 --> 00:18:21,540
-I don't see a ring anywhere.
-Don't worry. It's coming.

192
00:18:22,144 --> 00:18:24,441
I guess you play the cards
you're dealt, huh?

193
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:27,136
Or sometimes you just run away.

194
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:33,211
Look, I'm gonna
get back to work, okay?

195
00:18:33,421 --> 00:18:36,151
So just-- Just leave me alone.

196
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:38,590
Fine.

197
00:19:05,584 --> 00:19:08,017
-Oh, hey, babe.
-Hi, honey.

198
00:19:11,089 --> 00:19:12,579
What are you still doing awake?

199
00:19:12,757 --> 00:19:15,191
Nothing, really.
Just figured I'd wait up for you.

200
00:19:15,393 --> 00:19:18,294
Oh, sorry.
I went over to Goldie's after work.

201
00:19:18,496 --> 00:19:21,260
He wanted to show me
Missy's sonogram.

202
00:19:21,466 --> 00:19:23,228
They're gonna have a boy.

203
00:19:23,967 --> 00:19:26,993
I think I saw his little pecker,
it was really cool.

204
00:19:31,141 --> 00:19:33,837
You're gonna make a great father,
aren't you?

205
00:19:34,077 --> 00:19:35,977
I'm gonna try.

206
00:19:39,348 --> 00:19:41,578
We got a good thing.

207
00:19:41,751 --> 00:19:43,446
Don't we?

208
00:19:43,953 --> 00:19:45,853
Yeah, we do.

209
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,621
-Hey, Kelly.
-Hey, babe. What's up?

210
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:28,259
-Is Mom up yet?
-She's right there in the kitchen.

211
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:30,122
Oh, well, don't get up or anything.

212
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:32,696
Hold your horses, I'm coming.

213
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:35,523
-Hey, Ma.
-Hi, hon.

214
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:39,535
Oh, Claudia, I told you
you didn't have to do that.

215
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:41,536
I can go to the store myself,
you know.

216
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:43,572
Yeah, well, don't worry about it.

217
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:47,075
-So what's going on Kelly, anything?
-Same shit, different day.

218
00:20:47,245 --> 00:20:49,110
-Can't get a date.
-You're one to talk.

219
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:51,180
I get out of the house once in a while.

220
00:20:51,382 --> 00:20:54,510
What about that guy Marty?
I figured he'd be right up your alley.

221
00:20:54,719 --> 00:20:56,414
From the fish market? No, thank you.

222
00:20:56,587 --> 00:20:59,886
-Do I look that desperate to you?
-You want us to honestly answer?

223
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,954
So I guess no news
from your father, huh?

224
00:21:06,863 --> 00:21:09,388
You'd be the first one I'd tell
if I heard from him.

225
00:21:09,566 --> 00:21:11,261
Please don't start with that again.

226
00:21:11,434 --> 00:21:13,265
-Start with what?
-He left.

227
00:21:13,436 --> 00:21:17,270
He ain't coming back. Trust me, I know
a little something about guys like this.

228
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,031
Why would you say that?

229
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:20,971
He did this when you were a baby.

230
00:21:21,143 --> 00:21:22,770
He came back then, didn't he?

231
00:21:23,112 --> 00:21:25,979
If he gave a shit about us,
he would've called already.

232
00:21:26,915 --> 00:21:30,214
Even if that son of a bitch did call,
I wouldn't wanna talk to him.

233
00:21:30,386 --> 00:21:33,014
Watch your mouth.
He's still your father.

234
00:21:33,187 --> 00:21:34,779
Not to me, he's not.

235
00:21:34,956 --> 00:21:38,323
Why don't you take that fucking picture
off the wall already?

236
00:21:39,327 --> 00:21:41,420
Nice mouth, huh?

237
00:21:48,869 --> 00:21:52,635
This is pretty good.
You're finally getting the hang of it.

238
00:21:58,779 --> 00:22:00,770
What's the matter, babe?

239
00:22:02,348 --> 00:22:04,748
It's just my mom, you know?
She won't give up hope.

240
00:22:04,917 --> 00:22:06,851
It's tough to watch.

241
00:22:07,553 --> 00:22:08,781
I don't get your dad.

242
00:22:08,954 --> 00:22:12,754
I don't know how a guy can just run off
on his wife and kids like that.

243
00:22:12,925 --> 00:22:14,449
Yeah.

244
00:22:15,227 --> 00:22:18,787
-I can sort of understand why he left.
-You can?

245
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:21,193
Yeah. He obviously
wasn't happy anymore.

246
00:22:21,366 --> 00:22:23,994
Where's it written
you gotta be happy all the time?

247
00:22:24,369 --> 00:22:26,462
He didn't love my mother.
What's he to do?

248
00:22:26,638 --> 00:22:29,471
-Spend his life being miserable?
-That's not the point.

249
00:22:29,641 --> 00:22:31,904
We're talking about a guy
who abandoned his wife...

250
00:22:32,076 --> 00:22:34,237
...in the middle of the night,
no explanation.

251
00:22:34,411 --> 00:22:37,574
If he didn't love her anymore,
he should have asked for a divorce.

252
00:22:37,748 --> 00:22:40,615
He tried. But she wouldn't listen.

253
00:22:40,951 --> 00:22:43,442
She didn't wanna hear it,
didn't wanna believe it.

254
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:46,247
That's bullshit.
And why are you defending this guy?

255
00:22:46,456 --> 00:22:48,583
Can't you see
how it's affecting your mother?

256
00:22:48,758 --> 00:22:50,623
She hasn't left the house
in six months.

257
00:22:50,793 --> 00:22:52,192
I'm not defending him.

258
00:22:52,428 --> 00:22:54,896
I hate the son of a bitch
for what he's done to her.

259
00:22:55,064 --> 00:22:56,292
But he's my father...

260
00:22:56,466 --> 00:22:59,833
...and I grew up in that house,
so I can sort of understand his side.

261
00:23:00,902 --> 00:23:02,130
Well, I can't.

262
00:23:06,308 --> 00:23:09,038
Yeah, well,
I wouldn't expect you to.

263
00:23:47,713 --> 00:23:50,944
Son of a bitch. Not again.

264
00:23:53,652 --> 00:23:57,554
So, man, what happened to that other
mechanic you were telling me about?

265
00:23:57,756 --> 00:23:59,450
He died.

266
00:23:59,957 --> 00:24:02,482
Look, I don't want you
to take this the wrong way.

267
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,821
But that car you got?
A total piece of shit.

268
00:24:04,996 --> 00:24:07,487
Why don't you junk it
and save yourself the headache?

269
00:24:07,665 --> 00:24:10,099
Look who's talking.
What am I supposed to drive?

270
00:24:10,268 --> 00:24:12,668
Buy a new car.
You got the good job now.

271
00:24:12,837 --> 00:24:15,396
Do I look like I can buy a new car?

272
00:24:16,006 --> 00:24:18,839
Why don't you ask your old man
for a loan? He's got money.

273
00:24:19,009 --> 00:24:21,500
What do I look like?
I'm not gonna ask my parents.

274
00:24:21,678 --> 00:24:23,669
What's the big deal?
They're your parents.

275
00:24:23,847 --> 00:24:25,610
They're supposed to give you money.

276
00:24:25,782 --> 00:24:28,147
Maybe if I lived at home,
they'd make my bed too.

277
00:24:29,018 --> 00:24:32,010
Look, Michael, I don't know
if Claudia mentioned it at all...

278
00:24:32,188 --> 00:24:35,055
...but I stopped in at the diner
the other day for lunch...

279
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:39,684
...and I happened to notice she didn't
have a ring on her finger, man.

280
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:44,430
-What's up with that?
-It's because she doesn't have one.

281
00:24:44,632 --> 00:24:48,124
You know, I figure I'll buy her the ring
right after I buy that new car.

282
00:24:49,003 --> 00:24:53,372
-You guys are engaged though, right?
-Yes, like I told you.

283
00:24:53,541 --> 00:24:56,704
We're just not gonna make it official
till we settle on a date.

284
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:58,741
Neither one of us is going anywhere.

285
00:24:58,946 --> 00:25:01,779
I gotta admit,
I'm a little jealous of you, you know.

286
00:25:02,015 --> 00:25:04,449
I'm starting to think
maybe that's what I gotta do.

287
00:25:04,618 --> 00:25:07,109
It's time to find a girl,
settle down, do that thing.

288
00:25:07,287 --> 00:25:08,584
Yeah, you should.

289
00:25:08,755 --> 00:25:12,451
Only problem is, it seems all the girls
I used to know around here...

290
00:25:12,625 --> 00:25:15,321
-...they're already spoken for, huh?
-That's right.

291
00:25:15,528 --> 00:25:20,261
-Don't forget it.
-Don't worry, man. I'm not about to.

292
00:25:22,235 --> 00:25:24,430
So you gonna help me out or what?

293
00:25:24,604 --> 00:25:27,163
Come on, you cheap bastard,
don't I always help you?

294
00:25:27,339 --> 00:25:30,274
All of a sudden I'm gonna stop
fixing your car for free?

295
00:25:30,442 --> 00:25:32,307
It died outside the house.

296
00:25:32,477 --> 00:25:36,436
I don't know if you're cool with this,
but you'll have to come over to fix it.

297
00:25:36,648 --> 00:25:40,845
Yeah, well, look, I got Saturday off.
I could maybe come by do it then?

298
00:25:41,018 --> 00:25:43,612
No, no, no, Saturday's no good.
I gotta work.

299
00:25:43,787 --> 00:25:45,118
How about Sunday?

300
00:25:45,823 --> 00:25:50,658
Yeah. No, Sunday-- All right, yeah,
I'll come by-- I'll come by on Sunday.

301
00:26:51,017 --> 00:26:54,611
Hey, Michael. Mike, are you home?

302
00:26:59,425 --> 00:27:01,552
What the hell you are doing in here?

303
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,455
Oh, hey, Claudia. How you doing?

304
00:27:04,229 --> 00:27:07,062
Don't ''How you doing?'' me.
What the fuck are you doing here?

305
00:27:08,533 --> 00:27:11,195
Hey, you know,
it's really nice to see you too.

306
00:27:11,402 --> 00:27:13,267
Nice place you got.

307
00:27:13,438 --> 00:27:16,703
I'm not joking, Charlie.
What are you doing in our house?

308
00:27:18,176 --> 00:27:19,871
I came by to see your boyfriend.

309
00:27:20,044 --> 00:27:22,069
I knocked on the door
and it was open--

310
00:27:22,246 --> 00:27:26,079
So you just let yourself in and started
helping yourself to our beer?

311
00:27:26,683 --> 00:27:29,311
Yeah. Yeah, looks like that.

312
00:27:29,486 --> 00:27:32,683
So is he around?

313
00:27:33,924 --> 00:27:37,484
No. He's at work.

314
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,924
Why? What do you want him for?

315
00:27:40,162 --> 00:27:43,893
Well, didn't he tell you? I'm supposed
to come by today to fix the car.

316
00:27:45,067 --> 00:27:48,264
Yeah, he told me you were supposed
to come by tomorrow.

317
00:27:48,471 --> 00:27:50,769
Yeah, but see, I gotta work tomorrow.

318
00:27:50,973 --> 00:27:55,272
So I don't know, I figured I should
come by, see if I can do it today.

319
00:27:56,177 --> 00:27:57,974
You knew he wasn't
gonna be home today.

320
00:27:58,179 --> 00:28:01,478
No. No, I had no idea.

321
00:28:02,484 --> 00:28:04,247
I mean, I don't know, you know...

322
00:28:04,452 --> 00:28:07,181
...maybe, you know,
he may have mentioned it but--

323
00:28:07,388 --> 00:28:09,481
Then why don't you
just come back tomorrow...

324
00:28:09,723 --> 00:28:11,247
...like you said you were gonna?

325
00:28:11,425 --> 00:28:14,758
Because I gotta cover
for The Foot tomorrow, all right?

326
00:28:14,928 --> 00:28:17,658
So if lover-boy wants
his car ready for Monday morning...

327
00:28:17,831 --> 00:28:19,321
...I can only do it today.

328
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,228
So is this gonna be the routine now?

329
00:28:21,434 --> 00:28:23,459
You just hassle me
every chance you get?

330
00:28:23,636 --> 00:28:28,835
Hassle you? Hassle you.
All right. Let me get this straight.

331
00:28:29,075 --> 00:28:33,444
I come over here on my day off
to fix your boyfriend's car...

332
00:28:33,613 --> 00:28:37,708
...for free, no less,
and you accuse me of hassling you?

333
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:40,180
What do you think?
I got nothing better to do...

334
00:28:40,352 --> 00:28:42,513
...than come over
when Michael's not around...

335
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:45,349
...and see if I can sweet-talk
you for a couple hours?

336
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:48,987
I mean, come on, Claudia,
you know I'm not that kind of guy.

337
00:28:50,961 --> 00:28:53,725
You're just not gonna give up,
are you?

338
00:28:54,098 --> 00:28:55,963
Hell, no.

339
00:29:00,738 --> 00:29:04,673
All right, look.
And don't laugh at this, all right?

340
00:29:05,175 --> 00:29:08,474
But when I was in California...

341
00:29:08,645 --> 00:29:15,141
...I got a chance to do a lot of thinking
about us and about how I took off...

342
00:29:18,755 --> 00:29:21,450
...and, you know, and about
how much I missed you.

343
00:29:22,458 --> 00:29:26,326
All right? So that's why I came home.

344
00:29:27,262 --> 00:29:30,789
And that's why I'm hassling you.

345
00:29:33,068 --> 00:29:37,299
And that's why I'm probably
gonna continue to hassle you.

346
00:29:39,073 --> 00:29:41,541
Come on, you didn't miss me at all?

347
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:49,877
Yeah, I missed you.

348
00:29:51,384 --> 00:29:53,545
Then what do you say?

349
00:29:55,822 --> 00:29:59,019
No, I'm not gonna feel like this again.

350
00:29:59,726 --> 00:30:03,320
-Hey, Claud, are you home?
-Yeah, Teresa. In here.

351
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,531
Charlie.

352
00:30:11,237 --> 00:30:13,762
Hey, Teresa, how you doing?

353
00:30:14,106 --> 00:30:15,471
I'm fine.

354
00:30:15,875 --> 00:30:19,708
-How are you, keeping out of trouble?
-Yeah, yeah.

355
00:30:19,911 --> 00:30:23,176
Trying to convince your friend here
to change all that, but--

356
00:30:23,381 --> 00:30:25,872
He's just here to fix Michael's car.

357
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:28,814
Yeah. Yeah, I'm here to fix the car.

358
00:30:31,356 --> 00:30:33,846
I'm gonna grab my beer
and get started out there.

359
00:30:34,024 --> 00:30:37,926
-Oh, yeah, help yourself.
-All right. Speak to you.

360
00:30:38,829 --> 00:30:41,229
All right, Teresa,
we'll see you at the bar.

361
00:30:48,538 --> 00:30:51,063
-So?
-So what?

362
00:30:51,707 --> 00:30:53,470
Don't pull that. What was going on?

363
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:56,134
Nothing was going on.
He just came in to get a beer.

364
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:58,576
Claudia, it was obvious
something was going on.

365
00:30:58,748 --> 00:31:00,409
Teresa, we were just talking.

366
00:31:00,583 --> 00:31:03,016
If I were you,
I wouldn't even give him that much.

367
00:31:03,385 --> 00:31:06,354
Yeah? Well, you're not me, are you?

368
00:31:19,066 --> 00:31:21,125
Take a break.

369
00:31:28,309 --> 00:31:30,742
Can we get another round, please?

370
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:09,643
-Hey, Claudia.
-Hey, Alice.

371
00:32:10,281 --> 00:32:15,149
So I heard that Charlie's been doing
lunch over at the diner a lot these days.

372
00:32:15,318 --> 00:32:18,913
-What's up with that?
-Nothing's up with that.

373
00:32:19,122 --> 00:32:21,454
Oh, really? People are talking.

374
00:32:21,658 --> 00:32:24,218
Yeah? Well,
you shouldn't listen to them.

375
00:32:24,394 --> 00:32:26,555
I mean, how long ago
did you guys break up?

376
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:28,061
About two weeks ago.

377
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:30,289
-Really?
-Yeah.

378
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:32,227
You seeing anybody else right now?

379
00:32:32,468 --> 00:32:35,335
-No, not yet.
-That's good.

380
00:32:35,938 --> 00:32:38,463
You wouldn't wanna rush
into something right away...

381
00:32:38,641 --> 00:32:43,509
...you know, get into something crazy,
I don't know, I mean, would you?

382
00:32:43,678 --> 00:32:47,409
Can you believe that slut? I don't know
what he was thinking, marrying her.

383
00:32:47,582 --> 00:32:51,211
I'll tell you what. Her father gave him
a job. Couldn't get one on his own.

384
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:52,978
Bullshit. He got her pregnant.

385
00:32:53,154 --> 00:32:56,419
Her father threatened to cut his balls off
if he didn't marry her.

386
00:32:56,591 --> 00:32:58,717
-Can you see it?
-No.

387
00:32:58,959 --> 00:33:01,655
No, turn it this way.

388
00:33:02,696 --> 00:33:05,859
Oh, yeah. Look at that.
He's got a little one, huh?

389
00:33:06,066 --> 00:33:10,230
-Yeah, takes after his father.
-Sorry.

390
00:33:10,404 --> 00:33:11,735
He comes over on Saturday...

391
00:33:11,904 --> 00:33:15,067
...when I told him to come by on
Sunday to fix the car, you know?

392
00:33:15,241 --> 00:33:18,699
-Did he fix the car?
-That's not the point, Goldie.

393
00:33:19,045 --> 00:33:21,240
He said himself,
he wouldn't do anything.

394
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,414
Oh, I feel much better now.

395
00:33:23,616 --> 00:33:26,210
Hey, can we have a couple of shots?

396
00:33:27,185 --> 00:33:29,676
-Tony from the pizza place is here.
-So?

397
00:33:29,854 --> 00:33:32,015
What ''so''?
So he broke up with his girlfriend.

398
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:35,182
-I'm thinking maybe, you know....
-What?

399
00:33:35,493 --> 00:33:37,484
Do you guys have any rubbers on you?

400
00:33:37,662 --> 00:33:39,755
-Hear who moved in on State Street?
-I know.

401
00:33:39,931 --> 00:33:41,898
The O'Hara's sold their house
to them.

402
00:33:42,066 --> 00:33:44,864
That neighborhood's captured territory.
It's a shame.

403
00:33:45,035 --> 00:33:48,266
I give my mother a week
before she's got her house up for sale.

404
00:33:48,439 --> 00:33:51,374
All right, but tell me, why'd
he have to come into my house?

405
00:33:51,542 --> 00:33:54,909
Mikey, the guy, he's--
He's fixing your car for free.

406
00:33:55,112 --> 00:33:58,205
I'd say not out of whack
for him to come in and ask for a beer.

407
00:33:58,381 --> 00:34:00,212
There's something going on
in his head.

408
00:34:00,383 --> 00:34:02,647
I just wonder if he tried anything
with Claudia.

409
00:34:02,819 --> 00:34:04,650
Don't you think she would tell you?

410
00:34:04,821 --> 00:34:06,789
-Yeah, I do.
-Of course she would.

411
00:34:26,474 --> 00:34:27,771
What's happening, fellas?

412
00:34:36,951 --> 00:34:38,919
There they are.
How you doing, gentlemen?

413
00:34:39,086 --> 00:34:40,985
-Hello, Charlie.
-Charlie, how you doing?

414
00:34:41,187 --> 00:34:44,088
What's up, guys?
Guys, look, I want to meet....

415
00:34:45,191 --> 00:34:46,488
Annie, right? Annie.

416
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:49,355
Annie, this is Michael and Goldie.
My two oldest friends.

417
00:34:49,562 --> 00:34:51,655
Probably his only friends.
Nice to meet you.

418
00:34:51,831 --> 00:34:54,321
I've known these guys
since I was younger than you.

419
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,967
So be nice to them, all right?

420
00:34:56,168 --> 00:34:59,365
Annie. It's very,
very nice to meet you.

421
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:03,933
Control yourself, Goldie, all right?
You're a married man.

422
00:35:04,109 --> 00:35:05,838
I'm sorry, Charlie.

423
00:35:06,011 --> 00:35:09,377
So, what's up? I come over,
fix the car, I don't get a thank-you call?

424
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:12,743
No, thanks. I thought you were
coming over on Sunday, that's all.

425
00:35:12,917 --> 00:35:14,384
Yeah, didn't Claudia tell you?

426
00:35:14,585 --> 00:35:17,383
I was gonna come Sunday,
but I had to cover for The Foot...

427
00:35:17,555 --> 00:35:20,581
...so I figured Saturday was cool,
I hope that was all right.

428
00:35:20,792 --> 00:35:23,021
No, no, problem.
Just call us next time.

429
00:35:23,693 --> 00:35:25,718
Yeah, sure. Whatever.

430
00:35:25,896 --> 00:35:28,592
Hey, what are you doing next week?
You're on for poker?

431
00:35:29,166 --> 00:35:33,125
Yeah, I'll be there. I'll be there.
What about you, Mikey, gonna show?

432
00:35:33,303 --> 00:35:35,669
No, I'm definitely in.

433
00:35:37,606 --> 00:35:38,971
Hey, I'll be right back.

434
00:35:39,141 --> 00:35:41,041
I just have to go
to the bathroom, okay?

435
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:43,838
Yeah. Just don't take all night,
all right, sweetheart?

436
00:35:44,013 --> 00:35:46,243
-Okay.
-You guys want drinks? Come on, Mikey.

437
00:35:46,415 --> 00:35:48,406
-No. I'm good.
-Charlie, what do you want?

438
00:35:48,617 --> 00:35:49,982
Yeah. You know what? Get me--

439
00:35:50,152 --> 00:35:52,176
Get me, like, two shots
for her, all right?

440
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:55,216
Mary, three shots of Jack, please.

441
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:58,382
Charlie, where did you find her?

442
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,393
I know, can you believe it?
Is she fucking hot or what?

443
00:36:01,563 --> 00:36:03,861
You ain't gonna
take her home tonight, are you?

444
00:36:04,032 --> 00:36:06,193
What do you mean?
Of course I'll take her home.

445
00:36:06,367 --> 00:36:09,824
-You know, if her mother's not home.
-She's jailbait, for chrissake.

446
00:36:10,003 --> 00:36:12,437
You should be buying her
ice cream cones, not shots.

447
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,502
What are you talking about?
She's a freshman in college.

448
00:36:15,676 --> 00:36:18,406
I even saw her lD, right?
So it's legal, right?

449
00:36:18,579 --> 00:36:21,411
You know, in some southern states,
Charlie, it is legal.

450
00:36:21,581 --> 00:36:23,606
I'm out of here.

451
00:36:23,783 --> 00:36:26,047
What's with him?
All of a sudden, he's a saint?

452
00:36:26,552 --> 00:36:29,544
Don't worry about him.
Let's do these shots.

453
00:36:30,056 --> 00:36:32,422
-Cheers.
-All right.

454
00:36:32,758 --> 00:36:34,726
To young girls.

455
00:36:51,675 --> 00:36:55,076
-Wait a second.
-What? Something wrong?

456
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:59,546
No, I-- We just shouldn't be doing this
out here. Somebody might see us.

457
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:03,517
Well, then, what do you say--?
What do you say we go inside?

458
00:37:03,687 --> 00:37:06,211
I told you we can't.
My parents are home.

459
00:37:06,389 --> 00:37:09,256
-Your parents are home?
-Yeah.

460
00:37:09,425 --> 00:37:13,657
Well, look, I'm kind of tapped out,
but you got any money?

461
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:16,560
-Or, like, a credit card on you?
-Yeah.

462
00:37:16,733 --> 00:37:20,065
Well, then, what do you say
we go find a motel room?

463
00:37:22,204 --> 00:37:24,172
I don't-- I don't know.

464
00:37:25,307 --> 00:37:28,470
What do you mean, you don't know?
Is something wrong?

465
00:37:28,644 --> 00:37:30,908
No, I-- No.

466
00:37:31,113 --> 00:37:35,981
I'm just-- I'm not sure I'm ready
to do this right now, that's all.

467
00:37:36,217 --> 00:37:38,310
What, are you afraid of me?

468
00:37:38,519 --> 00:37:40,111
I mean, look at me.

469
00:37:40,321 --> 00:37:42,482
Look at me.
I'm a fucking pussycat over here.

470
00:37:42,657 --> 00:37:44,887
I'm not gonna hurt you. Come on.

471
00:37:48,461 --> 00:37:52,056
It's almost 5.
My parents are gonna be up soon.

472
00:37:53,533 --> 00:37:55,626
So, what are you saying to me?

473
00:37:56,369 --> 00:37:59,497
It's time to go home?
You calling it a night?

474
00:38:00,473 --> 00:38:03,999
I'm gonna be back home
in a couple weeks for spring break.

475
00:38:04,376 --> 00:38:06,173
Maybe we could wait till then.

476
00:38:06,779 --> 00:38:09,475
-Spring break?
-Yeah.

477
00:38:10,849 --> 00:38:15,650
Yeah, yeah. You know what?
I'll be waiting by the phone.

478
00:38:19,557 --> 00:38:21,650
Okay. Bye.

479
00:38:29,901 --> 00:38:32,869
-Kelly, where are you?
-Hold your freaking horses, I'm coming.

480
00:38:33,036 --> 00:38:34,901
Did she show you
what she's gonna wear?

481
00:38:35,072 --> 00:38:39,805
-Jeez, she looks like a frigging hooker.
-Ma, don't start with her tonight.

482
00:38:40,877 --> 00:38:43,175
-What do you think?
-Oh, my God.

483
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:44,972
What?

484
00:38:45,682 --> 00:38:48,514
-You look beautiful.
-You really do, Kelly. You look great.

485
00:38:48,718 --> 00:38:52,176
-Yeah? You don't think it's too much?
-If you got it, work it, baby.

486
00:38:52,355 --> 00:38:54,846
I figure a night out
with Marty the fishmonger...

487
00:38:55,024 --> 00:38:57,720
...has got to be better
than another night with you, Ma.

488
00:38:57,893 --> 00:39:00,020
-What do you think?
-You look like a floozy.

489
00:39:00,196 --> 00:39:02,686
But you've been dressing like this
since you're 1 3.

490
00:39:02,864 --> 00:39:05,264
You didn't give a crap
what I thought then either.

491
00:39:05,433 --> 00:39:09,028
Oh, don't say that, Ma.
You know I care what you think.

492
00:39:09,204 --> 00:39:11,104
Get the hell out of here.

493
00:39:11,339 --> 00:39:13,432
-So where you guys going?
-Casa Tina's.

494
00:39:13,608 --> 00:39:16,804
Casa Tina's? That's expensive.
This guy must make some coin.

495
00:39:17,011 --> 00:39:19,206
Hey, he's got his own shop.

496
00:39:19,847 --> 00:39:23,112
-That's him.
-We got Mr. Manners here too, huh?

497
00:39:23,317 --> 00:39:25,410
Doesn't even come to the door
to say hello.

498
00:39:25,586 --> 00:39:27,679
What, are you embarrassed
about your family?

499
00:39:27,855 --> 00:39:30,652
He's afraid of you, Ma.
He's heard the stories.

500
00:39:30,823 --> 00:39:34,384
-So, what do you think?
-I think you're gonna have a great time.

501
00:39:34,827 --> 00:39:36,954
Can you believe I'm actually nervous?

502
00:39:37,196 --> 00:39:40,324
-Do I look all right?
-Don't worry. You look beautiful.

503
00:39:40,533 --> 00:39:44,526
-Now go have a good time.
-All right, thank you.

504
00:39:46,338 --> 00:39:48,966
-I love you, babe.
-Love you too.

505
00:40:10,428 --> 00:40:12,396
So how's everything
with you and Michael?

506
00:40:12,563 --> 00:40:14,723
Everything all right?

507
00:40:14,931 --> 00:40:16,990
Yeah, everything's cool. Why?

508
00:40:17,233 --> 00:40:22,865
No reason. Just, you know, making sure.
Because I like Mike.

509
00:40:23,073 --> 00:40:24,938
He's a good man.

510
00:40:25,108 --> 00:40:27,303
-Yeah, well, everything's fine.
-Good.

511
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:29,306
I'm gonna go sit down now,
okay, Tony?

512
00:40:29,511 --> 00:40:31,001
All right.

513
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:33,671
If you need anything, let me know.

514
00:40:34,116 --> 00:40:35,845
I'll be here.

515
00:40:37,686 --> 00:40:40,621
So, what do you think of him?
Do you think he's cute?

516
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:42,648
He's not really my type.

517
00:40:42,891 --> 00:40:46,417
I used to think
he was sexy in high school.

518
00:40:47,128 --> 00:40:49,653
-I mean, he had hair back then.
-So ask him out.

519
00:40:49,897 --> 00:40:53,594
I tried the other night at the bar,
but he didn't get the hint.

520
00:40:53,801 --> 00:40:57,668
I think he got back with his ex-girlfriend
and I wouldn't feel right about that.

521
00:40:57,838 --> 00:41:00,136
Let's say you're sitting
home alone one night...

522
00:41:00,307 --> 00:41:02,241
...and you decide to order a pizza.

523
00:41:02,409 --> 00:41:06,140
And our man Anthony shows up.
Do you invite him in?

524
00:41:07,114 --> 00:41:09,708
Do I invite him in?
In a heartbeat, I invite him in.

525
00:41:09,883 --> 00:41:12,373
Okay. So you invite him in.
Now what do you do?

526
00:41:13,319 --> 00:41:15,219
Do I think he's into me?

527
00:41:16,222 --> 00:41:18,850
Oh, yeah, he wants you, you can tell.

528
00:41:19,024 --> 00:41:20,855
Okay.

529
00:41:21,227 --> 00:41:22,751
Then I make my move.

530
00:41:23,629 --> 00:41:25,961
-And?
-And....

531
00:41:26,165 --> 00:41:29,156
And what? Do I have sex with him?

532
00:41:29,968 --> 00:41:31,868
-Yeah.
-Yeah, well, if I'm gonna do it...

533
00:41:32,036 --> 00:41:34,061
...I'm gonna do it right, right?

534
00:42:03,205 --> 00:42:05,867
Hey, Foot, tell me...

535
00:42:06,108 --> 00:42:09,373
...what the hell is a guy your age
still doing here pumping gas?

536
00:42:09,578 --> 00:42:12,341
Making the rent, same as you.

537
00:42:12,781 --> 00:42:14,271
Hey, pal, look, all right?

538
00:42:14,482 --> 00:42:16,245
Don't go comparing your life to mine.

539
00:42:16,518 --> 00:42:18,713
I ain't here making the frigging rent.

540
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:21,682
Yo, Bugs, I'm gonna grab some lunch,
all right?

541
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:23,858
Charlie, you gotta be kidding me.

542
00:42:24,058 --> 00:42:25,854
You got 40 minutes, I'm timing you.

543
00:42:26,059 --> 00:42:27,924
All right. Thanks.

544
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:31,359
Look, I'm gonna grab some lunch.
You want me to get you anything?

545
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,700
Very nice.

546
00:43:39,194 --> 00:43:41,162
What's that smile about, huh?

547
00:43:41,363 --> 00:43:43,593
You just come back
from the junior high school?

548
00:43:43,765 --> 00:43:46,359
Hey. She was in college, all right?

549
00:43:46,602 --> 00:43:50,003
-Besides, I just drove her home.
-Oh, I'm sure you did.

550
00:43:50,205 --> 00:43:51,832
Want a beer?

551
00:43:53,608 --> 00:43:55,098
Okay.

552
00:43:56,711 --> 00:43:58,872
Look, I'm telling you,
nothing happened, okay?

553
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:01,514
I mean, I drove her home...

554
00:44:01,682 --> 00:44:05,448
...maybe there was, you know,
a little kiss, and that's it.

555
00:44:05,653 --> 00:44:08,314
Why? You-- You jealous or something?

556
00:44:08,521 --> 00:44:09,886
Why would I be jealous?

557
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:13,387
No reason. I mean,
but if you are jealous, I can understand.

558
00:44:13,593 --> 00:44:17,222
Because I'm sure it was a little weird
for you to see me with another woman.

559
00:44:17,464 --> 00:44:20,194
Especially a fine young thing
like that, right?

560
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:24,301
Well, I suppose if I thought she were out
of the 10th grade, I might be jealous.

561
00:44:24,503 --> 00:44:29,566
Hey, hey, she was in college, okay?
I mean, I saw her lD.

562
00:44:29,742 --> 00:44:31,437
Well, I hope so, for your sake.

563
00:44:38,316 --> 00:44:41,877
If l remember correctly,
you kind of like this song, don't you?

564
00:44:43,721 --> 00:44:46,656
Yeah, you know, I like all his stuff.

565
00:44:46,858 --> 00:44:52,762
Well, then what do you say
you give me a little-- A little dance?

566
00:44:53,797 --> 00:44:55,025
What, in here?

567
00:44:55,198 --> 00:44:58,065
Yeah, come on, you know,
a little slow dance.

568
00:44:58,235 --> 00:45:00,931
What are you talking about?
You don't know how to dance.

569
00:45:01,171 --> 00:45:02,604
I don't know how to dance?

570
00:45:02,773 --> 00:45:06,765
First of all, it's a slow dance and any
retard knows how to do a slow dance.

571
00:45:07,009 --> 00:45:09,409
And besides,
you don't remember our prom?

572
00:45:09,578 --> 00:45:11,205
We did some dancing that night.

573
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:13,780
Sorry, I can't.

574
00:45:15,217 --> 00:45:19,949
I don't know, it seemed the other day
at your house you felt like dancing.

575
00:45:20,155 --> 00:45:21,713
What happened to that?

576
00:45:22,791 --> 00:45:25,157
Yeah, well, we all make mistakes.

577
00:45:26,528 --> 00:45:28,689
So, what are you trying to say?

578
00:45:29,164 --> 00:45:31,098
You hate me or something?

579
00:45:32,734 --> 00:45:35,634
No, I'm just not dancing with you.

580
00:45:37,972 --> 00:45:40,600
All right, all right.

581
00:45:42,209 --> 00:45:44,700
I guess I'll go back to work then, huh?

582
00:45:45,546 --> 00:45:47,309
Guess so.

583
00:45:50,316 --> 00:45:52,045
Enjoy the beer.

584
00:45:52,218 --> 00:45:53,981
Thank you.

585
00:45:57,991 --> 00:45:59,822
Hey, Claudia.

586
00:46:01,561 --> 00:46:04,461
I told you you'd be cleaning
his dirty underwear, didn't l?

587
00:47:13,294 --> 00:47:15,524
-You okay?
-Yeah.

588
00:47:15,696 --> 00:47:19,495
-You sure?
-Yeah, I said I'm fine.

589
00:47:19,666 --> 00:47:22,396
What, you don't wanna go to the bar
and watch the game?

590
00:47:22,569 --> 00:47:25,265
No, forget it, it's fine.

591
00:47:27,174 --> 00:47:30,836
We don't have to go to the bar. We can
go to my mother's and get a nice meal.

592
00:47:31,010 --> 00:47:32,671
Everybody's gonna be there tonight.

593
00:47:32,845 --> 00:47:35,643
Couldn't we go into the city
and go to a nice restaurant?

594
00:47:35,848 --> 00:47:38,874
I just told you I can barely afford
to pay our bills...

595
00:47:39,051 --> 00:47:41,417
...and you want to go to the city
to a restaurant?

596
00:47:41,654 --> 00:47:45,021
Yeah. We haven't left this town
to do anything in over a year.

597
00:47:45,224 --> 00:47:48,090
It might be nice to see
different faces, different streets.

598
00:47:48,293 --> 00:47:50,488
Every time we go
over to your mother's house...

599
00:47:50,662 --> 00:47:52,687
...you end up sitting
watching football...

600
00:47:52,864 --> 00:47:54,729
...while your mother
and your sisters...

601
00:47:54,899 --> 00:47:57,424
...trap me and ask me
when we're gonna get married.

602
00:47:57,602 --> 00:47:59,661
-No, they don't.
-Yes, they do. Every time.

603
00:47:59,837 --> 00:48:01,896
And what do you say to them?

604
00:48:02,106 --> 00:48:04,006
The same thing I always say to you.

605
00:48:04,208 --> 00:48:06,802
Yeah, which is bullshit.

606
00:48:07,077 --> 00:48:09,568
-Please don't start with me.
-Don't start with what?

607
00:48:09,746 --> 00:48:13,011
I'm not gonna wait till I'm old
to get married. I'm ready for this.

608
00:48:13,183 --> 00:48:16,618
I know you're ready. In fact, everyone
we know knows how ready you are.

609
00:48:16,853 --> 00:48:19,253
We've been together forever.
What do you want?

610
00:48:19,422 --> 00:48:22,050
I don't know.
That's what I've been trying to tell you.

611
00:48:22,225 --> 00:48:24,716
-You don't want to hear that.
-It doesn't make sense.

612
00:48:24,894 --> 00:48:26,361
We're not getting any younger.

613
00:48:26,529 --> 00:48:29,122
I mean, when do you think
you're gonna wanna do this?

614
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:32,462
I just don't wanna rush into it,
Michael.

615
00:48:33,235 --> 00:48:35,863
What am I doing here?
Am I just wasting time?

616
00:48:36,071 --> 00:48:38,266
If I am, tell me,
so I can get on with my life.

617
00:48:38,473 --> 00:48:40,065
Why do you insist on hounding me?

618
00:48:40,242 --> 00:48:42,039
I'm not hounding you. I'm just--

619
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:45,736
Yes, you are! Because we have
this same conversation every week.

620
00:48:45,913 --> 00:48:49,713
I don't wanna go to your mother's
house and I'm not ready to get married.

621
00:48:49,884 --> 00:48:52,910
-Why not?
-I'm not ready to become a housewife.

622
00:48:53,087 --> 00:48:55,385
-Who says you gotta be?
-What else would I be?

623
00:48:55,556 --> 00:48:57,786
Tell me what else would I be
if we got married.

624
00:48:57,958 --> 00:49:01,586
-What would I do with my life?
-I don't know.

625
00:49:02,061 --> 00:49:06,088
That is exactly my point. Neither do l.

626
00:49:11,604 --> 00:49:13,571
Does she know about this?

627
00:49:13,739 --> 00:49:16,902
Oh, ladies, this is my lucky day.

628
00:49:17,109 --> 00:49:21,910
Goldie, I'll see your 50 cents
and I will raise you two bucks.

629
00:49:22,114 --> 00:49:26,574
Oh, Mikey, Mikey. All right.
You sure you can afford this?

630
00:49:26,785 --> 00:49:28,615
Don't you worry about me, Goldie.

631
00:49:28,786 --> 00:49:31,721
Good, because I can't. I'm out.

632
00:49:32,423 --> 00:49:33,981
You in or out?

633
00:49:34,759 --> 00:49:37,023
Look at Mikey over here
playing the big spender.

634
00:49:37,261 --> 00:49:38,819
Yeah, I'm in, tough nuts.

635
00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:44,626
I see your two dollars
and I raise you...

636
00:49:47,204 --> 00:49:48,796
...20. Think you can handle that?

637
00:49:48,972 --> 00:49:51,372
-We don't play for those kind of stakes.
-Come on.

638
00:49:51,541 --> 00:49:54,476
What are you doing?
We don't play for that kind of cash.

639
00:49:54,644 --> 00:49:57,612
He's sitting here grinning
like the big man with the big hand.

640
00:49:57,780 --> 00:50:00,840
I thought I'd give you a chance
to show us how big you are.

641
00:50:01,016 --> 00:50:02,506
Don't be an asshole, come on.

642
00:50:03,319 --> 00:50:04,980
You can always fold, big man.

643
00:50:07,723 --> 00:50:09,691
Goldie, loan me 20 bucks.

644
00:50:09,992 --> 00:50:13,154
Mikey, you're into me for 40 already.

645
00:50:13,328 --> 00:50:16,024
Have I not paid you back?
Come on, loan me 20 bucks.

646
00:50:17,131 --> 00:50:18,564
All right.

647
00:50:19,033 --> 00:50:20,261
All right.

648
00:50:21,336 --> 00:50:23,201
All right, Charlie, show me your hand.

649
00:50:24,339 --> 00:50:26,533
I hate to do this to you,
because I know--

650
00:50:26,707 --> 00:50:29,540
I know times are tough and all...

651
00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:31,837
...but it's a full house.

652
00:50:37,851 --> 00:50:41,411
-You're still a fucking scumbag.
-I don't know what to tell you, Michael.

653
00:50:41,587 --> 00:50:45,250
All your life, I've been beating you.
You thought that was gonna change?

654
00:50:46,492 --> 00:50:48,392
-Don't be a dick.
-He can't help himself.

655
00:50:48,561 --> 00:50:50,290
You should've stayed in California.

656
00:50:50,963 --> 00:50:53,397
I'm breaking your balls a little bit,
all right?

657
00:50:53,566 --> 00:50:55,294
Don't turn into a mary on us, okay?

658
00:50:55,467 --> 00:50:57,458
Guys, can we chill out
and play cards?

659
00:50:57,669 --> 00:50:59,398
Hey, Charlie, take it easy.

660
00:50:59,871 --> 00:51:01,270
Don't push me, Charlie, okay?

661
00:51:01,473 --> 00:51:04,442
Man, I'm not pushing you at all,
all right? I'm playing cards.

662
00:51:04,609 --> 00:51:07,476
You can't take it, hit the bricks.

663
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:11,607
-Fine. I'm out of here.
-Hey, Mikey, come on, man. Don't--

664
00:51:11,782 --> 00:51:14,216
-I'll lend you some money, don't worry.
-Fuck him.

665
00:51:14,385 --> 00:51:17,786
You know what? This ain't high school
anymore. You're fucking nothing.

666
00:51:20,557 --> 00:51:23,957
And another thing, keep the fuck away
from Claudia, all right?

667
00:51:27,096 --> 00:51:28,586
It's late.

668
00:51:29,032 --> 00:51:31,023
See you tomorrow, Goldie.

669
00:51:36,072 --> 00:51:37,300
You see this?

670
00:51:37,507 --> 00:51:40,771
I fix the guy's car for free,
this is the thanks I get, right?

671
00:51:41,643 --> 00:51:45,409
You're fucked up.
Why are you doing this?

672
00:51:46,715 --> 00:51:49,775
-What is that suppose to mean?
-Why don't you tell me?

673
00:51:50,385 --> 00:51:53,911
If I knew what you were talking about,
I could help you out, but I don't.

674
00:51:54,388 --> 00:51:56,447
Okay, Charlie.

675
00:51:57,425 --> 00:51:59,655
Is something going on
with you and Claudia?

676
00:52:01,162 --> 00:52:02,925
No. Why?

677
00:52:04,031 --> 00:52:06,522
-People are talking, Charlie.
-People are talking?

678
00:52:06,701 --> 00:52:09,260
Because that's all
there is to do in this town.

679
00:52:09,436 --> 00:52:11,301
Charlie, you can't do it to her.

680
00:52:11,538 --> 00:52:15,531
You can't come back and start screwing
with her head again. It just ain't right.

681
00:52:15,709 --> 00:52:18,940
Hey, who says I'm screwing
with her head, all right?

682
00:52:19,145 --> 00:52:22,341
Let's say the only reason I came home
is because I wanna see her.

683
00:52:22,548 --> 00:52:25,016
I show up to find my best friend
is living with her.

684
00:52:25,184 --> 00:52:27,778
What am I supposed to do?
Pack my bags and take off?

685
00:52:27,953 --> 00:52:30,285
I mean, that sounds fair to you?

686
00:52:31,423 --> 00:52:33,152
So, what are you gonna tell me?

687
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:36,657
You're still in love with her
after all these years?

688
00:52:39,063 --> 00:52:40,792
Maybe I am.

689
00:52:57,514 --> 00:53:00,312
-What happened?
-She's all right. She's fine, thank God.

690
00:53:00,484 --> 00:53:02,714
The doctor came by
a little while ago.

691
00:53:02,953 --> 00:53:05,785
He said there's nothing wrong with her,
she just collapsed.

692
00:53:05,988 --> 00:53:08,013
She's upstairs sleeping now, finally.

693
00:53:08,224 --> 00:53:10,021
So, what was it?

694
00:53:10,626 --> 00:53:12,389
Dad called.

695
00:53:16,165 --> 00:53:18,656
He is such a piece of shit.

696
00:53:22,036 --> 00:53:24,004
You wanna know why he called?

697
00:53:24,205 --> 00:53:25,968
He's in love and he's found himself.

698
00:53:26,174 --> 00:53:30,634
Oh, yeah, and he wanted to tell Ma
that she can have the fucking house.

699
00:53:30,845 --> 00:53:32,369
He's living down in Vegas now...

700
00:53:32,547 --> 00:53:35,674
...and he says
he's not gonna call us anymore...

701
00:53:35,849 --> 00:53:38,317
...and doesn't wanna
hear from us neither.

702
00:53:41,255 --> 00:53:44,247
I told you he never gave a shit
about us.

703
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:49,526
I hope he fucking dies tomorrow.

704
00:53:52,932 --> 00:53:55,696
When she was on the phone with him,
she just sat there...

705
00:53:55,902 --> 00:53:58,996
...just listening to him,
not saying nothing.

706
00:54:00,273 --> 00:54:04,003
And then she hung up the phone,
reaI calm, you know...

707
00:54:04,376 --> 00:54:06,503
...told me what he said...

708
00:54:07,279 --> 00:54:08,871
...and then she just went to bed.

709
00:54:09,047 --> 00:54:11,880
I woke up this morning to go to Mass,
she was still asleep.

710
00:54:12,050 --> 00:54:15,383
So I-- You know,
I thought she was fine.

711
00:54:16,521 --> 00:54:20,286
And then I come home and I found her
sprawled out on the floor.

712
00:54:32,236 --> 00:54:34,203
Oh, hi, baby.

713
00:54:34,404 --> 00:54:36,964
-How you doing?
-I'm okay.

714
00:54:37,207 --> 00:54:40,665
I mean, you know,
it's no big deal, I fell down.

715
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:48,583
You always were my beautiful baby.

716
00:54:49,618 --> 00:54:54,214
Hey, don't you cry
about a thing, huh?

717
00:54:55,724 --> 00:54:58,090
I told you he's done this before.

718
00:54:59,127 --> 00:55:02,960
You'll see, he'll be home soon.

719
00:55:03,197 --> 00:55:05,028
You'll see.

720
00:55:05,199 --> 00:55:07,064
Okay?

721
00:55:08,936 --> 00:55:10,836
Yeah, okay.

722
00:55:15,276 --> 00:55:18,938
You get out of here now,
let me take a nap.

723
00:55:19,412 --> 00:55:23,109
-Go on.
-Okay.

724
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:38,966
I was wondering when you'd find
the time to come by, say hello.

725
00:57:39,143 --> 00:57:40,974
How you doing, Charlie?

726
00:57:41,646 --> 00:57:44,944
Same old, same old.
What's up? You need some gas?

727
00:57:45,115 --> 00:57:48,016
Yeah. Fill me up. Regular.

728
00:57:48,952 --> 00:57:50,943
Yeah, I'll fill you up.

729
00:58:09,571 --> 00:58:13,438
-So...?
-Listen, I wanted to talk to you.

730
00:58:13,608 --> 00:58:16,202
Do you think we could,
you know, go somewhere to talk?

731
00:58:16,944 --> 00:58:19,811
Sure, is everything--?
Everything's all right?

732
00:58:19,981 --> 00:58:23,007
Yeah, everything's fine.
I just wanna talk.

733
00:58:23,618 --> 00:58:26,814
-Can you get a few minutes?
-Yeah, I can get a few minutes.

734
00:58:26,987 --> 00:58:29,012
Give me a second, all right?

735
00:58:34,661 --> 00:58:36,458
Hey, Bugs, I'm out of here, okay?

736
00:58:36,630 --> 00:58:39,690
Hey, Charlie,
get over here first, will you?

737
00:58:41,367 --> 00:58:42,595
Hey, man, what's up?

738
00:58:42,768 --> 00:58:45,965
Jimbo's leaving at the end of the month,
leaving me high and dry.

739
00:58:46,138 --> 00:58:49,130
I'm gonna need somebody
full-time at this point...

740
00:58:49,308 --> 00:58:53,244
...so if you give me 30 hours a week
built, you're the man for the job.

741
00:58:56,147 --> 00:58:59,708
I don't know. Give me a little time
to think about it?

742
00:58:59,884 --> 00:59:02,910
Yeah, just don't jerk me on it.
Let me know as soon as you can.

743
00:59:03,088 --> 00:59:06,580
Yeah. Thanks, man.

744
00:59:11,428 --> 00:59:15,194
Look at you, huh?
The happy brown bagger.

745
00:59:15,466 --> 00:59:17,366
Take it easy, Foot.

746
00:59:33,015 --> 00:59:35,245
You think we screwed up?

747
00:59:35,451 --> 00:59:37,248
Is this how
we were supposed to end up?

748
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:41,253
Why would you say ''end up''? You're
talking like your life's already over.

749
00:59:42,891 --> 00:59:45,223
I feel it closing in.

750
00:59:45,527 --> 00:59:47,757
It's always something.

751
00:59:50,966 --> 00:59:54,662
I mean, look at my dad.
I think that's why he left.

752
00:59:54,835 --> 00:59:58,862
Claudia, I mean, if you really feel
that way, why don't--?

753
00:59:59,573 --> 01:00:02,474
You know, why don't you just
come away with me when I go?

754
01:00:03,077 --> 01:00:05,875
Come on, Charlie,
you know I can't do that.

755
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:08,673
No, you know what? I don't know.

756
01:00:09,249 --> 01:00:10,841
Why not? Why not come with me?

757
01:00:11,417 --> 01:00:13,749
What's keeping you here?

758
01:00:16,923 --> 01:00:21,292
Because you really hurt me last time
and I don't wanna go through that again.

759
01:00:29,568 --> 01:00:31,195
Hey.

760
01:00:32,271 --> 01:00:34,296
Look, all right?

761
01:00:34,473 --> 01:00:37,908
I promise you
I'm not gonna hurt you again.

762
01:00:44,315 --> 01:00:47,443
I know how badly
I screwed up last time.

763
01:00:47,618 --> 01:00:50,951
I mean, why do you think
I was in such a hurry to get out of here?

764
01:00:52,622 --> 01:00:56,581
But it's, you know, it's different now.

765
01:00:57,928 --> 01:00:59,293
How?

766
01:01:00,096 --> 01:01:02,030
I guess this time--

767
01:01:02,599 --> 01:01:04,965
I mean, this time I need you.

768
01:01:05,135 --> 01:01:08,763
And I love you.

769
01:01:12,408 --> 01:01:14,467
Promise me
you're not messing with my head.

770
01:01:15,144 --> 01:01:19,581
Yeah. Yeah, I promise you.

771
01:01:45,772 --> 01:01:49,435
-Here you go.
-Oh, thank you, sweetheart. That'll help.

772
01:01:56,349 --> 01:01:58,715
Want me to fix you
something really good to eat?

773
01:01:58,885 --> 01:02:03,345
-No, this will do just fine for now.
-Okay.

774
01:02:09,361 --> 01:02:11,329
What are you so chipper about, huh?

775
01:02:11,663 --> 01:02:14,826
-Your poor mother lying here half-dead?
-Ma, don't talk like that.

776
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,629
I don't even know what you're saying.
I'm not ''chipper.''

777
01:02:18,802 --> 01:02:20,235
Oh, yeah?

778
01:02:21,005 --> 01:02:23,701
What's that smile on your face
all about?

779
01:02:26,243 --> 01:02:28,677
I don't know. Just stuff.

780
01:02:28,846 --> 01:02:30,677
''Just stuff''?

781
01:02:30,848 --> 01:02:32,748
Yeah, just stuff.

782
01:02:36,119 --> 01:02:39,680
Why don't you come over here and rub
some of that stuff off on your mother?

783
01:02:56,672 --> 01:02:58,640
Oh, God.

784
01:02:59,207 --> 01:03:01,334
I still miss him.

785
01:03:02,210 --> 01:03:04,143
I know, Ma.

786
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:17,156
-She still loves him, you know.
-Yeah, try to figure that one out.

787
01:03:19,859 --> 01:03:23,761
So did I tell you that Charlie moved
back home a couple weeks ago?

788
01:03:24,698 --> 01:03:26,859
Yeah, you told me.

789
01:03:31,037 --> 01:03:33,402
I think I'm gonna go out with him
tomorrow night.

790
01:03:33,572 --> 01:03:35,369
Claudia...

791
01:03:36,976 --> 01:03:40,935
...one asshole walks out of our lives,
you're gonna let another walk back in?

792
01:03:41,113 --> 01:03:43,547
I swear you're as bad as mom.

793
01:03:44,083 --> 01:03:46,607
I don't know
if I ever got over him, Kelly.

794
01:03:46,818 --> 01:03:48,718
What about Michael?

795
01:03:49,587 --> 01:03:52,988
You know? Are you thinking
about him through all of this?

796
01:03:54,492 --> 01:03:58,929
Look, I don't want you to think
I feel good about this...

797
01:03:59,797 --> 01:04:03,197
...but I'm just not happy
with Michael anymore.

798
01:04:04,468 --> 01:04:08,131
I want a different life
than the one I'm living so much.

799
01:04:08,638 --> 01:04:11,300
So you think Charlie's the answer.

800
01:04:13,643 --> 01:04:15,507
I don't know.

801
01:04:16,078 --> 01:04:17,978
But he might be.

802
01:04:18,514 --> 01:04:20,072
No.

803
01:04:21,317 --> 01:04:23,512
I'm not gonna tell you
how to live your life...

804
01:04:23,719 --> 01:04:27,849
...but I will give you the one decent
piece of advice Pop ever gave me.

805
01:04:28,090 --> 01:04:31,525
He said, ''No matter how hard you try,
you can't shine shit.''

806
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:34,760
And that kid is shit.

807
01:04:35,597 --> 01:04:39,294
No, Kelly, you're wrong.
It's different now. He changed.

808
01:04:39,868 --> 01:04:43,167
And he's reminded me
I want more out of life.

809
01:04:43,505 --> 01:04:46,735
Oh, I find that so hard to believe,
Claudia.

810
01:04:46,940 --> 01:04:48,464
People don't change.

811
01:04:49,243 --> 01:04:51,177
Look at Pop.

812
01:04:51,345 --> 01:04:53,939
I think you're looking
for something here...

813
01:04:54,114 --> 01:04:56,207
...that wasn't right for you
three years ago.

814
01:04:56,950 --> 01:04:59,042
So why do you gotta do this?

815
01:05:00,319 --> 01:05:04,380
Because I don't wanna wake up
1 0 years from now and ask ''What if?''

816
01:05:07,460 --> 01:05:08,791
Fine.

817
01:05:24,342 --> 01:05:27,072
-Take it easy, Scully.
-You too, doll.

818
01:06:15,923 --> 01:06:17,254
See you on Monday.

819
01:06:17,425 --> 01:06:21,225
-Where are you headed all prettied up?
-Nowhere special.

820
01:06:21,429 --> 01:06:24,364
''Nowhere special,'' my ass.

821
01:06:49,388 --> 01:06:51,253
There you go.

822
01:06:58,730 --> 01:07:01,426
-There you are, young lady.
-Thanks.

823
01:07:01,633 --> 01:07:05,160
All right, so you gotta explain to me
your deal with Florida, all right.

824
01:07:05,403 --> 01:07:09,339
I got a guy that I know from California
who's got a place down in Gainesville.

825
01:07:09,507 --> 01:07:13,306
He said we could crash there for free
for a couple of weeks till we get set up.

826
01:07:13,477 --> 01:07:14,842
What do we need with Florida?

827
01:07:15,012 --> 01:07:17,310
It's a bunch of old people,
early-bird specials.

828
01:07:17,481 --> 01:07:19,915
You gotta be kidding me.
It's beautiful down there.

829
01:07:20,083 --> 01:07:23,450
-And they got good beaches, I mean--
-I don't need any more beaches.

830
01:07:23,654 --> 01:07:27,612
I wanna go someplace different,
like Seattle.

831
01:07:27,823 --> 01:07:29,757
Seattle? No shot.

832
01:07:29,926 --> 01:07:32,417
It's miserable there.
I mean, it's cold, it's rainy.

833
01:07:32,595 --> 01:07:35,086
If we're gonna do that,
we may as well stay here.

834
01:07:35,298 --> 01:07:37,789
No, if we're gonna do this,
I want someplace warm.

835
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,490
I mean, let's go out West.
We'll go to Vegas.

836
01:07:40,669 --> 01:07:42,432
No.

837
01:07:43,038 --> 01:07:47,031
How about Texas?
You'd look good in a cowboy hat.

838
01:07:47,209 --> 01:07:48,972
-Oh, you think so, do you?
-Yeah.

839
01:07:49,144 --> 01:07:52,545
Texas, huh? I like Texas. That works.

840
01:07:52,714 --> 01:07:54,647
It's a big place,
anywhere in particular?

841
01:07:54,815 --> 01:07:57,545
No. We'll figure it out
when we get there.

842
01:07:57,718 --> 01:08:00,846
All right, then. Texas it is.

843
01:08:02,223 --> 01:08:03,815
You see?

844
01:08:04,058 --> 01:08:06,492
I told you we were meant
for one another, didn't l?

845
01:08:06,694 --> 01:08:08,285
Yeah.

846
01:08:11,331 --> 01:08:14,232
What's up? Something wrong?

847
01:08:15,001 --> 01:08:18,801
Do you ever think about what our lives
would be like if we'd had the baby?

848
01:08:18,972 --> 01:08:22,499
Yeah. Yeah, we'd be miserable.

849
01:08:23,208 --> 01:08:25,574
Because we're just
so happy now, huh?

850
01:08:25,811 --> 01:08:29,247
I'm happy. I'm real happy.

851
01:08:30,515 --> 01:08:34,349
Now, Claudia, think about it. If we
had kids, we'd be spending every day...

852
01:08:34,519 --> 01:08:37,976
...working hard to feed them,
clothe them, put them through school...

853
01:08:38,189 --> 01:08:41,886
...only for them to tell us to go
fuck ourselves when they turn 1 6.

854
01:08:42,093 --> 01:08:43,856
No, thanks.

855
01:08:44,729 --> 01:08:47,027
It's probably good you feel that way.

856
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:53,358
Because I'm wanna tell you something
that I haven't told anybody.

857
01:08:53,536 --> 01:08:57,404
I mean, not my mother, not Michael,
not even Kelly. Okay?

858
01:08:58,008 --> 01:09:01,171
Yeah, yeah. What's up?

859
01:09:04,414 --> 01:09:07,007
After I had the abortion...

860
01:09:07,883 --> 01:09:10,010
...there were some complications...

861
01:09:10,185 --> 01:09:14,349
...and I had to go back
in the hospital.

862
01:09:15,524 --> 01:09:19,187
And now they say there's a chance
I might not be able to have children.

863
01:09:21,596 --> 01:09:23,791
Look, l....

864
01:09:26,634 --> 01:09:29,398
Hey, I'm sorry, you know?

865
01:09:32,874 --> 01:09:34,808
It's weird, you know?

866
01:09:35,542 --> 01:09:40,445
I never really thought about wanting kids
until I heard maybe I couldn't.

867
01:09:47,521 --> 01:09:49,079
Hey.

868
01:09:50,790 --> 01:09:53,953
What do you say
you give me that dance now, huh?

869
01:10:01,567 --> 01:10:03,159
Come on.

870
01:12:52,092 --> 01:12:54,720
-Goldie, you seen Claudia tonight?
-Mikey, what's up?

871
01:12:54,895 --> 01:12:56,988
No, I ain't seen her.

872
01:12:57,464 --> 01:13:01,126
-Help yourself.
-Think she's at your house with Missy?

873
01:13:01,334 --> 01:13:04,394
No, I don't think so.

874
01:13:04,604 --> 01:13:06,401
Is everything all right?

875
01:13:07,974 --> 01:13:09,965
No, everything's not all right, all right?

876
01:13:10,142 --> 01:13:13,771
It's 1 :00 in the morning and
I haven't heard from my old lady all day.

877
01:13:13,945 --> 01:13:16,277
Something's up man, I know it.

878
01:13:16,481 --> 01:13:19,143
What are you talking about?
What's wrong with you?

879
01:13:19,317 --> 01:13:23,083
She's probably out
with her sister or Teresa.

880
01:13:24,756 --> 01:13:27,452
Maybe you just missed her at home.
Why don't you try her?

881
01:13:27,659 --> 01:13:31,253
You probably just missed her, go ahead.
Come on.

882
01:13:31,795 --> 01:13:35,788
Can I get another shot here?
This is bullshit.

883
01:13:48,378 --> 01:13:51,541
<i>Hi, we're not home.
Leave a message at the beep.</i>

884
01:13:51,781 --> 01:13:54,545
<i>Claudia, if you're there,
pick up, it's me.</i>

885
01:13:54,717 --> 01:13:57,151
Claudia, it's me. Pick up.

886
01:14:04,126 --> 01:14:06,117
She's not there.

887
01:14:12,667 --> 01:14:14,794
Do you know something?

888
01:14:14,969 --> 01:14:16,698
Michael, what would I know?

889
01:14:16,871 --> 01:14:18,862
What would you know?

890
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:21,565
Is she out with Charlie?
Is that what's going on here?

891
01:14:21,776 --> 01:14:24,677
Mikey, I don't-- I don't know nothing.

892
01:14:24,879 --> 01:14:27,403
Do you know something or not?

893
01:14:29,683 --> 01:14:34,677
Mike, what do you want me
to say to you?

894
01:14:36,856 --> 01:14:39,723
Then you're gonna fuck me
behind my back too, huh?

895
01:14:39,893 --> 01:14:41,985
Come on, Mikey.

896
01:14:42,161 --> 01:14:44,186
Here. Thanks for the drink.

897
01:14:44,363 --> 01:14:46,797
Have a nice fucking life.

898
01:15:04,916 --> 01:15:09,353
-Michael, what's going on?
-Hey, Ter, sorry. Is Claudia here?

899
01:15:09,587 --> 01:15:11,076
No.

900
01:15:11,321 --> 01:15:13,380
-No.
-You know where she is?

901
01:15:14,057 --> 01:15:18,687
No. I mean, maybe she's with Kelly.

902
01:15:18,895 --> 01:15:20,692
I called Kelly's, there's no answer.

903
01:15:20,864 --> 01:15:24,129
I tried the bar.
I can't find her anywhere, you know?

904
01:15:26,535 --> 01:15:28,230
Well...

905
01:15:29,205 --> 01:15:32,072
...if she's not there
and she's not here....

906
01:15:37,947 --> 01:15:39,846
Do you...?

907
01:15:42,050 --> 01:15:44,041
Do you wanna to come up?

908
01:15:47,656 --> 01:15:50,420
-I mean, we can just talk--
-No.

909
01:15:50,759 --> 01:15:55,161
Listen, babe, you see Claudia, just
tell her I'm waiting back home, all right?

910
01:15:55,362 --> 01:15:57,796
Great. Fine.

911
01:16:01,168 --> 01:16:02,999
Michael.

912
01:16:03,671 --> 01:16:05,468
I'm sorry.

913
01:16:07,307 --> 01:16:09,001
So am l.

914
01:18:54,462 --> 01:18:56,953
Why are you doing this to me?

915
01:19:01,903 --> 01:19:03,597
What?

916
01:19:03,838 --> 01:19:05,669
Wanna tell me
where you were all night?

917
01:19:08,242 --> 01:19:11,734
-I was at work and then I went out.
-You didn't think to maybe call me?

918
01:19:14,114 --> 01:19:15,911
I'm sorry.

919
01:19:16,851 --> 01:19:19,444
I just went out and lost track of time.

920
01:19:19,652 --> 01:19:21,950
Please don't give me
a hard time about it, okay?

921
01:19:22,155 --> 01:19:24,453
Give you a hard time, huh?

922
01:19:25,692 --> 01:19:28,126
You walk through the door
at 5:00 in the morning...

923
01:19:28,294 --> 01:19:31,195
...and I'm not supposed to
give you a hard time.

924
01:19:32,298 --> 01:19:36,131
I'm sitting alone, staring at these walls.
I don't know if you're alive or dead.

925
01:19:36,301 --> 01:19:38,997
And I'm not supposed
to give you a hard time.

926
01:19:40,839 --> 01:19:43,103
Do me a favor, Claudia.

927
01:19:44,443 --> 01:19:45,774
Sit down.

928
01:19:49,180 --> 01:19:50,875
Sit down.

929
01:19:58,456 --> 01:20:01,220
Now, why don't you tell me
where you were tonight?

930
01:20:05,695 --> 01:20:07,629
I was at work and then I went out.

931
01:20:07,797 --> 01:20:10,664
I called work.
They told me you left early.

932
01:20:11,735 --> 01:20:13,896
Why'd you leave work early?

933
01:20:15,138 --> 01:20:18,038
Because it was quiet and I had plans.

934
01:20:18,207 --> 01:20:20,539
I called your mother's house.

935
01:20:21,010 --> 01:20:24,241
I called there three times,
and there was no answer.

936
01:20:25,681 --> 01:20:28,548
-Why would you call my mother's house?
-I don't know.

937
01:20:28,717 --> 01:20:30,877
Maybe because
I was worried about you.

938
01:20:32,353 --> 01:20:34,253
I'm sorry.

939
01:20:38,626 --> 01:20:41,561
You don't give a fuck about me,
do you?

940
01:20:42,030 --> 01:20:43,895
Michael....

941
01:20:45,198 --> 01:20:47,928
I can't deal with this, Claudia.

942
01:20:49,202 --> 01:20:51,670
Why can't you just
be honest with me?

943
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:56,200
Just answer me.
Do you give a damn about us anymore?

944
01:20:57,844 --> 01:20:59,743
What? I can't hear you.

945
01:20:59,912 --> 01:21:02,073
Where were you tonight?

946
01:21:07,420 --> 01:21:09,183
I don't know.

947
01:21:09,355 --> 01:21:11,220
You don't know.

948
01:21:12,959 --> 01:21:15,392
You don't know where you were...

949
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:17,687
...or you don't know
who you were with?

950
01:21:17,862 --> 01:21:20,387
Or you don't know
if you give a damn about us anymore?

951
01:21:20,565 --> 01:21:23,056
I'm not gonna let you
make a jerkoff out of me.

952
01:21:23,234 --> 01:21:27,466
There's plenty of other women out there
who'd show me a little bit of respect.

953
01:21:32,810 --> 01:21:35,370
You were with Charlie, weren't you?

954
01:21:38,549 --> 01:21:40,244
Weren't you?

955
01:21:40,417 --> 01:21:42,214
Yeah.

956
01:21:50,626 --> 01:21:52,150
Michael, let me explain.

957
01:21:52,762 --> 01:21:54,992
The last thing I wanted to do
was hurt you.

958
01:21:55,198 --> 01:21:58,633
-I don't deserve this.
-I'm so sorry.

959
01:21:59,301 --> 01:22:01,496
You know what I want you to do?

960
01:22:02,270 --> 01:22:04,500
I want you to leave my house.

961
01:22:05,207 --> 01:22:08,142
I want you to pack a bag
and I want you to leave.

962
01:22:08,310 --> 01:22:10,574
I don't ever wanna fucking
see your face again.

963
01:22:10,779 --> 01:22:13,645
-Michael, come on.
-Get out.

964
01:22:14,148 --> 01:22:16,616
Just get the fuck out of here.

965
01:24:17,396 --> 01:24:19,330
Everything all right?

966
01:24:19,532 --> 01:24:23,229
-Yeah, everything's fine, Mom.
-Any news from your father?

967
01:24:23,535 --> 01:24:25,059
No.

968
01:24:25,871 --> 01:24:27,429
Good.

969
01:24:27,772 --> 01:24:30,468
The next time he calls,
he's gonna want the house back...

970
01:24:30,642 --> 01:24:33,634
...and we're gonna be
out on the street.

971
01:24:38,082 --> 01:24:41,540
Oh, God, will you smell that sea air?

972
01:24:43,287 --> 01:24:46,381
Jesus, Mary and Joseph,
I've been holed up long in this house...

973
01:24:46,557 --> 01:24:49,424
...that I forgot
what the ocean smelled like.

974
01:24:52,163 --> 01:24:54,426
You're feeling better, huh?

975
01:24:54,931 --> 01:24:56,728
Yep.

976
01:24:57,400 --> 01:24:59,368
I guess I am.

977
01:25:01,104 --> 01:25:03,299
What's going on with you?

978
01:25:06,776 --> 01:25:08,766
I'm....

979
01:25:09,978 --> 01:25:13,641
I guess it's not gonna work out
with me and Michael after all.

980
01:25:15,184 --> 01:25:18,176
Yeah, I sort of suspected that.

981
01:25:20,522 --> 01:25:23,285
You know,
ever since you were a little girl...

982
01:25:23,457 --> 01:25:27,757
...you were always much more
like your father than you were like me.

983
01:25:28,329 --> 01:25:30,957
Don't take that the wrong way.

984
01:25:31,132 --> 01:25:34,363
I fell in love with him
because he was so different than...

985
01:25:34,535 --> 01:25:37,469
...God, everybody around here.

986
01:25:40,807 --> 01:25:44,538
I guess I knew what I was getting into
when I married him.

987
01:25:47,714 --> 01:25:51,171
But you always think
you're gonna change somebody.

988
01:25:53,419 --> 01:25:55,512
You can't do it.

989
01:26:00,526 --> 01:26:03,051
So it's okay, you know.

990
01:26:05,331 --> 01:26:08,299
It's okay to take care of yourself.

991
01:26:12,370 --> 01:26:14,167
Yep.

992
01:27:25,505 --> 01:27:27,496
Hey, darling.

993
01:27:42,020 --> 01:27:43,544
Well, look who it is.

994
01:27:44,323 --> 01:27:45,654
Hi.

995
01:27:46,892 --> 01:27:48,381
How you been?

996
01:27:51,228 --> 01:27:55,130
So look, I've been doing
some thinking about the trip...

997
01:27:55,333 --> 01:28:00,236
...and I think if we're gonna do this,
I figure we may as well leave next week.

998
01:28:00,404 --> 01:28:02,098
What do you think?

999
01:28:03,073 --> 01:28:05,234
I've been....

1000
01:28:07,544 --> 01:28:12,106
-I just don't think it's gonna work.
-You don't think it's gonna work.

1001
01:28:12,549 --> 01:28:14,278
That's great.

1002
01:28:15,919 --> 01:28:18,819
So, what are you gonna do?
You gonna marry Michael after all?

1003
01:28:20,923 --> 01:28:23,983
Nope. It's got nothing to do with him.

1004
01:28:24,193 --> 01:28:26,161
Well, then, what is it?

1005
01:28:27,162 --> 01:28:30,825
I mean, did I--?
Did I do something wrong?

1006
01:28:31,632 --> 01:28:35,568
No. No, you didn't do
anything wrong. I just--

1007
01:28:36,204 --> 01:28:38,934
I gotta figure some things out.

1008
01:28:39,307 --> 01:28:42,435
And I think it's best
if I just figure them out on my own.

1009
01:28:42,643 --> 01:28:46,305
If anyone's gonna understand that,
it's gonna be you, right?

1010
01:28:47,314 --> 01:28:49,839
Yeah. Yeah, I guess.

1011
01:28:51,618 --> 01:28:55,281
So, what, I guess this is
your idea of payback, huh?

1012
01:28:55,455 --> 01:28:58,219
Nope, it's nothing like that.

1013
01:28:58,792 --> 01:29:00,952
I'm just taking care of myself.

1014
01:29:02,528 --> 01:29:04,359
All right.

1015
01:29:04,997 --> 01:29:07,557
So I guess I'll see you around, right?

1016
01:29:09,902 --> 01:29:11,460
Yep.

1017
01:29:12,238 --> 01:29:14,138
See you around.

1018
01:29:18,610 --> 01:29:20,976
Hey, Claudia.

1019
01:29:21,913 --> 01:29:24,507
I hope you find
what you're looking for.
