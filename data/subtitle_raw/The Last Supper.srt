[Thunderclap]

43
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:30,293
it seems that the national
organization of women,

44
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:34,797
otherwise known as now,
otherwise known as lesbians fond of plaid,

45
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:38,801
have chosen once again to take issue with yours truly.

46
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:43,306
These angry feminists,

47
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:45,808
and i say
angry feminists...

48
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:48,311
like there's
some other kind,

49
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:50,313
are obsessed--

50
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:53,816
should we be helping her?
We should be helping her. So start helping her.

51
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:56,319
You don't need us.
Why don't you help her?

52
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,323
Why don't i carry your slippers in my mouth?
That's an answer?

53
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:03,326
You don't help her,
you don't help us.

00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:06,829
We'll have the appetizers while we
wait for pet e and what's her name.

55
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:10,333
I didn't have any salsa,
so we have to dip in hummus. Sorry.

56
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,835
I don't care.
Thank you, paulie.

57
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:15,338
What we need in this country,
my friends, is leadership.

58
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,840
Someone who can stand up
to the liberals.

59
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,343
We need a return,
goddarnit,

60
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:23,346

He's a moron.
Honey, he's a genius.

67
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:42,365
Here's a guy who can take any issue,
turn it into a national debate.

68
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,867
He tells lies better than most people tell the truth.

69
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:47,370
Please. It's always good to keep
track of what the enemy is doing.

70
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:53,376
A storm is brewing, my friends.
Someone has to stop it.

71
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,878
Well,
it's my tv.

72
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,383

truly puerile.

74
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,387

So, who's pet e bringing?
Jenny tyler.

76
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,392
Not funny. The kidnapped girl?
That's funny.

77
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,394
It's very funny.
It's just tasteless.

00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,916
Then my fucking benz--
no guest?

84
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,419
Not exactly.

85
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,421

Oh, hey.

00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,423

87
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,925
Zack picked me up
in his pickup truck.

88

What was wrong with my mer cedes again?
Cracked manifold.

I don't usually take charity.

No. Wait. Come back.
Stay for dinner.

95
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,947
Why don't you stay for dinner?
We're expecting a guest.

96
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:06,949
We got a place set.
It's pissing out.

97
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:08,951
I don't wanna be any trouble.
No. No. Please.

I love my car. Your folks can give you
another hand-me-down mer cedes.

105
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:16,018
[Pete] no, jude.
It would have to be a new car.

106
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:18,020
Twitchy was looking for you
in the quad today.

107
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,022
No way?
Yes, way.

108
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:22,525
He had that big booty butt,
you know.

109
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,527
No. He wasn't
looking for me.

110
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:26,529
Excuse me.

111
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:29,532
Aren't y'all

Oh, we eat our salad after the main course,
european style.

No, i mean grace.
We don't say grace.

00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:15,077
Why do you want to know
where i live?

123
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,581
I'm just making conversation.

124
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,583
You see, every sun day

125
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,085
we've been inviting a guest
over for dinner and discussion.

126
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,089
What do you
talk about?

127
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:31,093
Everything. Life.
Current events.

128
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:33,095
The environment.
The law.

129
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:35,598
Well, i don't live anywheres around here.

130
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,600
I drive a truck.

131
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,102
Zack was telling me
on the way over here...

132
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:44,607
that he's actually driven through
all 48 conterminous states.

133
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,609
Um, wow.
Fascinating.

134
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:51,113
So, uh, you all college
students or something?

135
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,616
[Paulie] we're grad students.
What's that?

136
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:56,619
Oh, it means
we-- we've graduated.

137
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:59,121
We're earning
our masters degrees.

138

I'm gonna be a master painter.

Masturbator.
[Laughter]

140
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:09,632
just plain master.

141
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:16,639
- I'm studying social work.
- Jude is actually continuing studies in, uh--

142
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,641
what is it this week?

143
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:21,143
Psychology.
Thank you.

144
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:25,147
[Zack] you paint those pictures there?

145
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:28,150
Uh-huh.
Marc wants to be a time traveler.

146
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,152
Time traveler?

147
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:33,656
You know,
go back in time to change history.

148
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:36,659
What if the confederacy
had a liquid metal guy?

149
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:39,662
Or what if eisenhower
was a girl?

150
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:43,666
And what do you
do again?

151
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,669
Don't you know?
I'm a professional basketball player.

152
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,672
You makin' fun
of me?

153
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,674
No. No.
Of course not.

154
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:54,677
I'm getting my ph.d.
in political science, zack.

155
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,679
That means i'm going
to be a doctor.

156
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,182
Zack, have you always
driven a truck?

157
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,685
No.

158
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:05,688
I was
in the marines.

159
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,690
I was
in the war.

160
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:11,193
War?
What war?

161
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:14,196
Desert storm.
Was that really a war?

162
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:17,700
I just thought that was a
republican commercial campaign.

163
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:22,204
You got a problem
with patriotism?

164
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:24,707
As a concept?
No.

165
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:28,210
Well, i love my country,
and i'll fight anyone that says different.

166
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:31,714
Who is joey goebbels, 1933? [Buzzes]

167
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:34,717
now, seriously,
i don't think the germ ans were actually patriotic.

168
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:37,720
I think it was a hysterical wave of nationalism.
Same thing.

169
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,722
Patriotism leads
to nationalism.

170
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,724
No. Not true.
Wait. Wait. Wait.

171
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:45,227
Which one had the--
the designated hitter rule?

172
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:47,229
The american league.
I just want to know.

173
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:49,231
Hitler had the right idea.

174
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,736
Excuse me?

175
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:56,238
That was an extraordinary statement, zack.

176
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:59,241
I'm not say in' that kill in' jews was right.

177
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:03,245
If he really did, i mean.
There's no real proof, you know.

178
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:05,748
Um, he killed
six million jews.

179
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,750
And millions of gypsies and catholics.

180
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:11,253
[Zack] all numbers, really.
Nobody can prove it.

181
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:13,756
Funny, ain't it?

182
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:16,759
When it comes to buyin' shit,
the jews are always bring in' the numbers down.

183
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:19,762
"Two thousand for this old car?
I'll give you 1,200, tops." Right?

184
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:23,265
When it comes to ww2,
they're always push in' the numbers up.

185
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:27,770
First it's six million.
Then it's seven million.

186
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,772
[Pete] why don't we change the subject?

187
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,774
Yeah. Do you like
the lasagna?

188
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:34,276
No, i wanna hear this.
I wanna-- wait a minute.

189
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,779
What do you think,
in your vastly finite wisdom,

190
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,782
that hitler had
the right idea about?

191
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:44,787
Well, it's common knowledge
that the jews, no offense,

192
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:48,791
were stealing money from the germ an
people just like they do here now.

193
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,793
Really? Oh, yeah.
It's a fact.

194
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,795
First of all the jews
were germ ans.

195
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:55,798
Now, come on.
Jews ain't like that. No. No.

196
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,800
Come on. Jews
ain't like that.

197
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,303
It's always be in' a jew first.
Oh, i see.

198
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:04,807
That's why everybody hates 'em.
Everybody does not hate the jews.

199
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,809
You're thinking about people
who can read.

200
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:12,314
Marc, you're
a jew, right?

201
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:15,818
Right.
All right.

202
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:18,821
If the u.s. was to go to war against israel,

203
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:21,323
who would you
fight for?

204
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:24,827
Well, i guess that would be the
side that paid me the most.

205
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:27,329
How 'bout
you, luke?

206
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,832
If the u.s. was to fight africa--

207
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:32,835
africa's a continent, zack.
Yeah, i know that.

208
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,837
Which side
would you take?

209
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:37,339
Well, what if
the u.s. went to war...

210
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:40,342
against whatever
louisiana swamp you come from?

211
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:42,344
[Luke] how's that for heavy?

212
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:46,348
Calling people names.
That ain't polite.

213
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:49,852
Of course, that's always been
the trouble with colored people.

214
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,354
Quick temper.

215
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:54,356
[Thunderclap]

216
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:58,360
excuse me?

217
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,863
My grandfather
used to say...

218
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,365
if we knew you boys were gonna be so much trouble,

219
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:06,869
we'd just pick the damned cotton ourselves.

220
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,871
Am i conscious?

221
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:12,875
- That's a yes.
- Why don't we just eat?

222
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:17,880
Fine with me.
Am i here?

223
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,883
Grad students.
Shit.

224
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,885
You all don't know nothing about anything anyway.

225
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:26,388
Yeah, zack, i'm sure you're
much smarter than we are.

226
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,893
Christ. I know
what you all are.

227
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:33,896
You're a bunch of damned liberals.
What are you, a nazi?

228
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,398
Or is that too far
to the left?

229
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:38,400
Ha-ha-ha.

230
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,904
You all think you're so smart,
don't you? Huh?

231
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:45,407
You all just sit back and whine
and complain like you always do,

232
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:47,409
but you don't
do no thin'.

233
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,411
A war comes up.
Do you fight?

234
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:52,915
Hell, no. You protest.
Protest can be a powerful thing.

235
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,917
Protest is for pussies.

236
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,920
Try fight in' for some thin',
puttin' your life on the line...

237
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,923
before you start talk in' to me
about powerful things.

238
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,427
You left-wingers
make me wanna puke.

239
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,933
Never take a real stand,

240
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:14,937
a stand that you'd be will in' to-- [luke] die for.

241
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,940
No, boy.
Dying's easy.

242
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,443
Ain't no thin' heroic
about d yin'.

243
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:26,448
But if you can take a stand for some thin' you'd kill for,
that's some thin'--

244
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:29,451
some thin' special.

245
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:33,455
Okay. All right.
I think maybe you should leave now, zack.

246
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:35,958
I'm fix in' to,
don't worry.

247
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,961
One of these days all you bleed in' hearts...

248
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,963
are gonna learn
that we're right.

249
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:44,967
Us people with jobs,
i'm talk in' about. Real people.

250
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:48,971
We do all the fight in' and work in'
and d yin' and you do all the bitchin'.

251
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:51,473
[Scoffs]
grad students.

252
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:54,476
I'm glad you all
don't join up.

253
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:58,480
You wouldn't even know what to do,
would you? Guess not.

254
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,983
[Pete] what the fuck are you doing, zack?

255
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,986
I ain't gonna hurt him.
I'm gonna show you all a little experiment.

256
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,988
Okay, zack.
We get your point.

257
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:09,992
Fuck you all. I fought for my country.
I killed for my country.

258
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:14,496
All the while you guys were laugh in' back here,
hopin' we'd fall on our faces.

259
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:16,999
- Please, stop it!
- [Jude] calm down, zack.

260
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:21,503
Fuck you! Look at your buddy here.
Scared white.

261
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:24,006
Well, blue eyes,
a guy's hold in' a knife at your throat,

262
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:26,508
tell in' you
he's gonna kill ya.

263
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:29,011
Yeah, he's gonna
kill ya.

264
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:32,514
Then i'm gonna rape your pretty
girlfriend before i kill her too.

265
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,517
What are you gonna do, kike?
Bargain with me?

266
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:41,523
Huh?

267
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,527
[Gasping]

268
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:48,030
jesus.

269
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,532
Get this boy
some balls.

270
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:56,038
Uhh!
[Paulie gasps]

271
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:59,541
that shut you up, huh?
Huh, war hero?

272
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,543
You think you can come in here and bully us?

273
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:03,545
Huh?
You threaten women?

274
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:07,049
Some war!
Us against some third-world country.

275
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:10,052
Pushing buttons and smart-bombing chimneys.

276
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,054
[Laughs]

277
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:14,556
so, tough guy.
What did you train on?

278
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:18,060
Nintendo?
[Chuckles]

279
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:23,065
i bet you didn't even get off the boat,
you ignorant fuck!

280
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:27,069
You finished,
rich boy?

281
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:29,071
[Yells]

282
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:33,075
[screaming continues]

283
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,577
hey, soft hands.

284
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:37,579
Stop it!
You're hurting him!

285
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:40,082
[Yells]

286
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:43,085
he's a tough guy.
He can take it.

287
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:46,088
[Screaming] [bone snapping] [pet e screams]

288
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,090
i didn't mean to--
[screaming]

289
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,096
oh, my--

290
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:08,610
[belches]

291
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:12,614
[screaming, yelling]

292
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:16,618
[pet e]
oh! Oh!

293
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,620
Is he really dead?

294
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:22,124
[Jude] yes, paulie!
It is a side effect of a knife in the back!

295
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:24,626
- [Paulie] oh, christ!
- Nowyou find religion.

296
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:28,630
Shut up! Look at all this blood!
That was self-defense.

297
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,632
He wasn't
hurting you!

298
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:32,634
[Pete] oh, my fucking arm!
He broke my arm!

299
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:35,637
[Jude] am i an accomplice?
Let's just get ourselves together now.

300
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:38,140
A little late to be getting rational,
don't you think?

301
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,642
I had to do something.
The rest of you just sat there.

302
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:44,146
- He broke my fucking arm!
- He broke his fucking arm!

303
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:47,149
- He was a right-wing asshole.
- That's still no excuse to kill a person.

304
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:50,152
- It's a pretty good reason.
- So i'm a murderer?

305
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,154
We have to tell the police.
They'll understand.

306
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:54,156
Of course
they'll understand.

307
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:58,160
College kid kills farm boy war hero.
You'll probably just get a ticket.

308
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,162
Marc could plead insanity.
We'll cover for you, marc.

309
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:04,166
- Van gogh did some of his best work in an asylum.
- Thanks.

310
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,169
I can't believe this.
This man is dead.

311
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:09,171
He's never
getting up again,

312
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:12,174
and all you can think about is m arc's
future employment opportunities.

313
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,676
Well, we could discuss
zack's future opportunities,

314
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:16,678
but at this point,
i think they're limited.

315
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,680
Owee, owee, owee!

316
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:23,185
Oh, my god! Calm down, paulie.
Somebody give her a drink.

317
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,187
I need a drink.

318
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:30,192
I will not calm down!
Nobody should calm down.

319
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:33,195
You all act like this is something we do every sun day.

320
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:36,698
Invite a guest over,
and if we don't agree with his politics, kill him.

321
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:39,701
Paulie, he pulled a knife.
He threatened to rape you.

322
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:44,706
We're all in shock, paulie.
We're just dealing with it in our different ways.

323
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:48,210
I say we just bury the cracker and eat dessert.

324
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,212
This is terrible!

325
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:53,215
Not that bad, paulie.

326
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:56,718
People get killed every day,
people a lot nicer and more innocent than zack.

327
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:59,721
If you wanna feel bad,
feel bad about one of them.

328
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:02,724
He was carrying a hunting knife.
What is up with that?

329
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:06,228
Maybe he was a hunter.
People shouldn't go around carrying big knives.

330
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:09,731
It's not illegal
to carry a big knife!

331
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:11,233
It should be.
Look what happened.

332
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:15,237
It is, however, illegal to stab someone.
Especially in the back.

333
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,239
Why don't you just
give him your car?

334
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:21,243
- We have to tell the police.
- I am not gonna be an accomplice.

335
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:26,248
I really admire how you consistently put
your feelings first before anybody else.

336
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:29,751
Me?
You're the one sending your boyfriend to the poke y.

337
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:31,753
Okay, listen! Let's just
tell them the truth.

338
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,755
Zack got drunk.
Marc got drunk.

339
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:37,259
Marc stabbed him. At worst,
you're gonna get involuntary manslaughter.

340
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,261
I didn't get drunk.
[Luke] better start now.

341
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,263
I smoked dope.
Yeah, tell them that.

342
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:44,266
[Pete] listen.
I am being serious.

343
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,268
It was an accident.
They'll understand.

344
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:49,271
"Officer, we had this guy over
for dinner and he was rude.

345
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:52,774
So marc stabbed him in the back.
Do you have a problem with that?"

346
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:54,276
Wake up, pet e.
Bitch!

347
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:58,780
All right.
Do i need a coat?

348
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,782
I'll go with you.
Hold on.

349
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:04,286
- Come on!
- The police are an option.

350
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,788
They're the only option. No.
There is another option.

351
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:08,790
Yes! Take me
to a hospital.

352
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,792
Hear me out.

353
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,798
What if we just
forget about him?

354
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:20,302
[Pete] are you out of your mind?
Listen.

355
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:23,305
Say we just bury this guy in the backyard or something.

356
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:26,308
People disappear
all the time.

357
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:29,811
Especially in iowa.
We probably saved him from an alien abduction.

358
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:33,815
We don't report anything.
We don't tell anyone.

359
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:35,817
We just
let this pass.

360
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:38,820
No. We do not just
let this pass.

361
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:43,325
No?
You want to go to jail for this fascist fuck?

362
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,327
He's dead, luke.
Exactly.

363
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:48,330
And no thin' is gonna change that.

364
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:51,833
Luke is right.
We all know it was an accident.

365
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,336
If we let this pass,
we can go on...

366
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,838
with the rest
of our lives.

367
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,341
[Luke] if we don't let this pass,

368
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,343
things will never
be the same.

369
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:03,845
Things already will
never be the same.

370
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,348
Have i mentioned that my fucking arm is fucking broken!

371
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,350
Yes.
Yes.

372
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:12,354
- Pete, where's zack's truck?
- It's out front.

373
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,356
Good.
This is what we're gonna do.

374
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:18,360
- Paulie, jude, take pet e to the hospital.
- Yea!

375
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:23,365
Marc. Marc.
What?

376
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:25,867
I want you to help me bury the body.
Okay.

377
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,870
Then i'll drive the truck somewhere.
Somewhere far.

378
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:32,874
And then--
marc. Marc?

379
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:35,377
What?
I want you to follow me...

380
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,879
in your car
and bring me back.

381
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:41,883
You're serious.
Just pretend that this never happened.

382
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:44,386
What never happened?
What never happened?

383
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,388
Exactly.

384
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:48,390
[Sighs]

385
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,392
oh, lord.

386
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:53,895
Is that the license plate from the mer cedes last night?

387
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:55,897
Yeah.
Was it important?

388
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:58,900
Probably not.

389
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,902
What are those?

390
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:03,405
Leads on
the kidnapping.

391
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,407
You go on tv talking
about jenny tyler,

392
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:07,409
everybody wants
to talk to a lice.

393
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:09,911
Three guys
have proposed already.

394
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:45,947
[Woman sobbing]

395
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,952
[woman sobbing]

396
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:03,465
[sobbing]

397
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:09,471
Everywhere is
freaks and hairies?

398
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:11,473
Dykes and fairies?

399
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:14,476
Tell me where is sanity?

400
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:21,983
Nothing in the times.
We're all clear in the tribune.

401
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:23,985
Did you check
theusa today?

402
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:25,987
Let's not flatter
ourselves.

403
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:27,989
I'm not talking
about the front page--

404
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:31,493
how 'bout those
hawk eyes, huh?

405
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,495
I'm talking
about the back page.

406
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,497
They have that little section on each state.

407
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:37,499
Just do it!

408
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:40,001
I'd love
to change the world?

409
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:42,003
Iowa: ames.

410
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:45,507
City council approves expansion of
the iowa state athletic facility...

411
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,509
at a budget
of $2 million.

412
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,512
I think we're in the clear.
Good.

413
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:54,516
And would you take off those
glasses and that homeboy hat.

414
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,523
You got a problem?

415
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:07,028
Population
keeps on breeding?

416
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:09,531
That's a guy that we should have over to dinner.

417
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,533
Mm-h mm.

418
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:14,536
Here's a hypothetical.

419
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:17,038
If you try and trivialize this horrific situation...

420
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:20,041
with one of your stupid hypothetical s, marc,
i'll scream.

421
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:22,043
Just hear me out.

422
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:25,046
You're a time traveler.
[Screams]

423
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:27,048
jesus!

424
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:29,050
[Laughing]

425
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:35,056
it's 1909 in austria, okay?

426
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:38,560
You're in a pub having a schnapps with a stranger,

427
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,563
a young art student
with one testicle.

428
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:44,065
Let's say
his name is adolf.

429
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:47,068
Adolf at this point in his life has done no wrong.

430
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:49,070
He's not bitter.
He's not angry.

431
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:52,073
He's committed no crime.
He does not bring knives to the dinner table.

432
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:54,075
He has not
killed anybody.

433
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:56,077
He certainly hasn't
started a world war.

434
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:58,580
Your point being?

435
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:02,083
Do you kill him?

436
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:06,087
Do you poison his schnapps to save
all those millions of innocent people?

437
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:09,090
Would hitler
drink schnapps?

438
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:12,093
Look, this is ridiculous.
Zack was not hitler.

439
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:16,097
How do you know?
You can't look into the future, can you?

440
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:19,601
Well, i would kill
the bastard slowly.

441
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:23,104
You know where i stand.
Pete?

442
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:27,108
No comment.

443
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:32,614
I would use some thin' blunt,
like a motherfuckin' chair.

444
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:35,116
Paulie, it's not like we're killing mozart here.

445
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:37,619
We killed a guy that i am sure
was an evil force on this planet.

446
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:41,122
[Laughs] an evil force on this planet?

447
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:43,625
You have to start reading books without pictures, marc.

448
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:47,128
Yeah, you're not god. You can't decide
who's good and evil, who lives or who dies.

449
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:51,633
What if you kill somebody whose
death makes the world a better place?

450
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,635
But that's bullshit.

451
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:56,137
We have no idea that zack's death
makes this world any better.

452
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:58,640
My world
feels better.

453
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,642
Maybe he was right.

454
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:02,644
Who?
Zack.

455
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:04,646
Maybe he was right about how we do no thin' but talk...

456
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:07,649
and sit back and let the conservatives
do whatever they want.

457
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,651
They put aside
their differences,

458
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:11,653
and they achieve
their common goals,

459
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:15,156
and we always get stuck arguing about the stupidest,
tiniest little things.

460
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:18,660
What, like murder? Conservatives are simple.
No, they're effective.

461
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:23,164
So we buy animal-friendly mascara.
Or we stop buying grapes.

462
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:26,167
But we don't do anything.
All we do is fight.

463
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:28,169
We do not fight.
Yes, we do.

464
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:30,672
No, we don't.
We do. I--

465
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:33,174
look. We're liberals.
We do the right thing.

466
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:35,176
Then how come the world
is so fucked up?

467
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:37,178
Because we don't
run the world.

468
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:39,180
Exactly.
We don't.

469
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:42,684
- We finally do some good.
- Do some good?

470
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:45,186
Think about all
the right-wing assholes...

471
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:48,189
the world would've been
better off without...

472
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:51,192
if someone had wasted them
before they did any damage.

473
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:54,696
Anyone who ever killed
an abortion doctor.

474
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:56,698
Pol pot.
Idi amin.

475
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:59,701
Joseph mengele.
Joseph mccarthy.

476
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:02,704
Joey terieo.

477
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:05,206
Fromdance fever?

478
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:07,208
No. A kid
from sixth grade.

479
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:09,711
He broke my glasses
eight times.

480
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:11,713
Little motherfucker.

481
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:13,548
And if they're
such big assholes...

482
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,550
we can't
convince them--

483
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:19,554
well, you're sitting
across from hitler--

484
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:23,058
still no comment?

485
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,562
I'm in.

486
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:30,565
If it was hitler,
i mean, i would kill him.

487
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:34,069
[Laughing]

488
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:36,571
paulie?
No.

489
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:39,074
No.
I would thank him for his schnapps,

490
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:42,077
get back into the time machine,
set it for home and go to bed.

491
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:44,579
Which is where i'm going right now.
Good night.

492
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:46,581
Night.
Night.

493
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:52,587
[Sighs]

494
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:54,589
i wouldn't wanna
stab 'em, though,

495
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:56,591
'cause that
was too weird.

496
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:01,096
I would club them.

497
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:03,098
Obviously,
we'd poison them.

498
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:06,601
Obviously.

499
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:09,604
I wouldn't want them to know
that they were being poisoned.

500
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:12,107
I mean,
it's bad enough they have to die.

501
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:14,609
I wouldn't want their last thoughts to be,

502
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:18,613
"hey, i'm being killed
by these liberals."

503
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:21,116
Well, maybe
we could just scream...

504
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:24,619
and act like it's some horrible accident.

505
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,623
That way their thoughts on
earth wouldn't be horrible ones.

506
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:33,128
That's nice.

507
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:35,130
[Luke]
jude already knows.

508
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:39,134
The blue bottle is bad,
the green bottle is good.

509
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:41,636
What is
that stuff anyway?

510
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,141
Arsenic.

511
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,143
None of us are
going to do this.

512
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:50,145
Probably not.
But--

513
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:54,149
just in case the guy pulls a knife.

514
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:58,653
Everyone, this is
reverend gerald hutch ens.

515
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:00,655
This is luke.

516
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:02,657
Luke, a pleasure.
Paulie.

517
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:04,659
Paulie. A pleasure.
That's marc there.

518
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:06,661
Marc.
And pet e.

519
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:08,663
Oh, pet e.

520
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,668
Nice to meet all of you.
Nice to meet you.

521
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:18,173
I had no idea this meal was going to be so formal.

522
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,675
[Luke] we like to take care of our guests, reverend.

523
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:22,677
[Laughter]

524
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:24,679
so, reverend,
where's your parish?

525
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:27,182
[Reverend hutch ens] we have a
little parish outside of maple falls.

526
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,684
- Really? That's where i'm from.
- You must've seen our manger.

527
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:33,188
We have the biggest
baby jesus in the county.

528
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:36,191
[Laughing] well,
i hope you're hungry.

529
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:39,694
I am famished.

530
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:41,696
And it all
looks so delicious.

531
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:43,698
Is that apple pie?

532
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:45,200
[Paulie]
it's homemade.

533
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,202
Really?
[Chuckles]

534
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:50,205
would you
like to say grace?

535
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,709
You know,
i would love it.

536
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:57,712
I had no idea you younger
people were into that.

537
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:02,717
It's very charming.

538
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:04,719
Shall we bow our heads?

539
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:08,723
Bless us, o lord,
for this bounty...

540
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:10,725
[whispers] a fucking reverend?
Which we are about to receive.

541
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,728
For this blessing of youth and kindness... wait.

542
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:15,730
You have chosen
to bestow upon me,

543
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,732
god bless us all.

544
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:23,238
So, reverend,
how do you and jude know one another?

545
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:27,242
I interviewed the good reverend
for a research paper i was doing.

546
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:31,246
Yes. On the vileness.

547
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:35,750
The vileness?
The vileness?

548
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,752
The gay plague,
of course.

549
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:45,260
On the use of secular therapy in
comforting families of aids patients.

550
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,762
The good reverend here was kind enough to let me...

551
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:50,265
use his view as
a counterpoint position.

552
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:52,267
Oh.

553
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:56,771
So you don't believe in comforting the families?

554
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:59,274
No, i do not believe
in comforting the families...

555
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:01,776
of irredeemable
mortal sinners.

556
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:07,782
Are those biscuits
made from scratch?

557
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:10,285
[Luke] mm-h mm.
Really?

558
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:12,787
They are lovely.

559
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:14,789
Mmm.

560
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:18,793
Of course, aids is not a sin.
It's a terrible disease.

561
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:21,296
Not quite.

562
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:23,798
Homosexuality is
the terrible disease...

563
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:25,800
and aids is the cure.

564
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:28,803
[Reverend]
is there butter?

565
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:31,806
Come again?
Butter?

566
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:34,309
- Butter, yeah.
- Oh. Thank you.

567
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:37,312
No, no.

568
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:41,316
When you violate the moral,
health and hygiene laws,

569
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:43,318
you reap the whirlwind.

570
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:45,320
You cannot shake your fist
in god's face...

571
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,322
and get by with it.

572
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:50,325
Ready for more wine?
Yes.

573
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:52,327
No. Wait.
Wait.

574
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:54,329
I mean, it's white wine,
and we're having meat.

575
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:56,331
I think we should wait for dessert.
Yes.

576
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:01,836
Surely, being a reverend,
you must have some compassion?

577
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:04,339
Yes. I mean,
jesus himself would be...

578
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:06,341
one of the most compassionate men in history.

579
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:08,843
Why, yes. Certainly.

580
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:11,846
But jesus would never
touch a homosexual.

581
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:14,849
But we're all
god's children.

582
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:16,851
We are all
god's children.

583
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:18,853
But like children,
we can get into trouble,

584
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:21,356
and when we do,
we must be punished.

585
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:24,859
Gerald is the leader
of god's way.

586
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:26,861
God's way?

587
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:28,863
Homosexuals are
the living,

588
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:32,367
breathing cesspool
of pathogens.

589
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:36,371
We simply propose to put them
out on a desert island...

590
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:38,873
with enough foodstuffs to last
them for their limited lifetimes.

591
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:40,875
And what would that be?

592
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:44,379
Say, two years,
tops.

593
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:48,883
That way,
for a nominal cost to us,

594
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:50,885
they would all die.

595
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:54,389
Is this radicchio?

596
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:56,391
Yes.
Yes.

597
00:32:57,892 --> 00:33:01,396
Has anyone close to you ever died of aids?

598
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:04,399
[Chuckles] really.
Really.

599
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,901
No!
[Chuckles]

600
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,409
i think it's time
for dessert.

601
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:23,418
Yes.

602
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:32,427
Thank you.

603
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:35,430
I'd like
to propose a toast.

604
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:53,448
To... god's soldiers.

605
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:55,450
I like that.

606
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:15,970
This pie is delicious.

607
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:26,481
[Reverend]
is anything wrong?

608
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:29,484
We're dieting.

609
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:31,986
Can i make a confession?

610
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:34,489
Yes.
Do you want more white wine?

611
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:36,491
No.
I-- i, uh--

612
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:38,993
i think this pie
might be...

613
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:41,496
a little too rich.

614
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:43,498
[Coughs]

615
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,502
excuse me.

616
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,507
[Coughing]

617
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:55,510
[coughing
continues]

618
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:01,015
[violent
coughing]

619
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:05,520
[screaming]

620
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:10,525
[screaming continues]

621
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:16,531
[violent
coughing]

622
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:26,040
[gasps]
[screaming]

623
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,545
[jude]
is he dead?

624
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:36,551
He's real dead.
Oh, god.

625
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:39,053
Maybe we should say the last rites or something.

626
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:41,556
No. You do
that before.

627
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:44,559
We should just finish dinner before it gets cold.

628
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:49,063
How can you guys eat with a dead man at the table?

629
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:52,066
What is your problem?
You're the one who gave him his death sentence.

630
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:54,569
[Mimics lugosi as dracula] "i think it's time for dessert."

631
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,571
What was that,
anne rice?

632
00:35:56,571 --> 00:36:02,076
No, i think paulie behaved-- performed beautifully.

633
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:04,579
Yes.
So do i.

634
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:06,581
We gave him every chance possible.

635
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:10,084
I wanna
propose a toast.

636
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:12,086
To us,

637
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:14,088
for making
a difference,

638
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:17,592
for putting aside
our differences,

639
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,594
and for making the world a better place.

640
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:24,098
L'chaim.
L'chaim.

641
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:32,106
Please pass
the radicchio.

642
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:37,612
Butter?
[Coughs]

643
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:40,114
don't choke. Pat him on the back.
He's choking.

644
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:43,618
Honey.
You okay?

645
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:46,120
[Jude] jesus christ!
He switched the glasses!

646
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,122
Marc.
He switched the glasses!

647
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:50,124
Marc.
Oh, my god!

648
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:52,126
Get up. The heimlich.
Marc. Marc!

649
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:54,128
Marc!
Get up.

650
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:56,130
The heimlich.
There-- there--

651
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:58,132
call 911.

652
00:36:58,132 --> 00:37:00,134
[All]
no!

653
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:02,637
[Paulie]
marc! Marc!

654
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:05,139
[Pete]
marc. Aw, shit!

655
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:08,142
What?
[Others groan]

656
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:11,145
ooh! Jerk!
Oww!

657
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:13,147
[Luke laughs]

658
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:18,152
[pet e] let's get him out of here.

659
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:20,154
[Marc]
oh, yeah.

660
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,667
[Tv show host]
this was in the paper today.

661
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:37,171
They want to do another
gay pride parade.

662
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:39,173
I mean, do you
really think...

663
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:41,175
that a bunch
of gays and lesbians...

664
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:45,179
strutting through town
constitutes a parade?

665
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:48,182
Does anybody remember what
it was like when we were kids...

666
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:50,184
and we had parades
that meant something,

667
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:53,688
that were about real wonderfully festive events...

668
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:56,691
with people dressed in wonderfully inventive costumes...

669
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:58,693
like kings and queens?

670
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:03,197
You know, actually,
now that i think about it,

671
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:06,701
that does sound a little bit like a gay pride march.
[Audience laughs]

672
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:09,764
[dinner guest] how often does a woman say no,

673
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:11,766
but she really
means yes?

674
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:16,270
She says, "stop,"
but she means, "keep going."

675
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:19,273
You can't bring the law
into someone's bedroom.

676
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:21,776
It's constitutionally
wrong.

677
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:25,279
Isn't violating a woman's body constitutionally wrong?

678
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:28,282
[Dinner guest] isn't leading a man on wrong?

679
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:30,284
If a woman accepts
a date with a man,

680
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:32,286
especially in
this day and age,

681
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:34,789
she knows what he's after,
and she accepts.

682
00:39:36,273 --> 00:39:39,777
So you think that all dates lead to sex?

683
00:39:40,277 --> 00:39:41,779
I don't.

684
00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:44,281
Man is the dominant species.

685
00:39:44,281 --> 00:39:46,283
Women are the dominated.

686
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:49,286
They are the weaker sex.
They always will be.

687
00:39:49,286 --> 00:39:51,288
We're not talking
about species.

688
00:39:51,288 --> 00:39:53,791
A man does not have the right to rape a woman.

689
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:55,793
No. No. Of course
he doesn't, paulie.

690
00:39:56,293 --> 00:39:58,796
Rape is a terrible thing.

691
00:39:59,296 --> 00:40:02,299
But it is also much rarer
than people think.

692
00:40:02,299 --> 00:40:04,301
When a woman
cries rape,

693
00:40:04,301 --> 00:40:07,805
it's usually because she's already consented to sex.
Really?

694
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:09,807
Yeah. Really.

695
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:12,810
And if she doesn't allow herself to enjoy it,
then she feels used.

696
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:15,312
So women, vindictive
by nature, cry rape,

697
00:40:15,312 --> 00:40:18,315
and force the man to suffer the feelings of inadequacy...

698
00:40:18,315 --> 00:40:20,317
that they themselves
have created.

699
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:22,820
The world stops
and you destroy the man.

700
00:40:25,322 --> 00:40:27,825
It's quite self-defeating, really.

701
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:30,327
Keep them in the kitchen
barefoot and pregnant.

702
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:34,331
No. No, i think
that's a little sexist.

703
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:39,336
So, this is what your parade is all about?

704
00:40:41,338 --> 00:40:44,341
- We're stealing a chapter from the
civil rights movement. - Mm-h mm.

705
00:40:47,344 --> 00:40:50,347
Gotta fight for what
you believe in, right?

706
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:52,349
Yep.

707
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:54,351
Absolutely.
I think we can all drink to that.

708
00:40:57,354 --> 00:40:59,356
Please.

709
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:13,370
'Cause dominating minds
play judge and jury too?

710
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:14,872
Oh, no?

711
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:18,876
But they're dominating minds
and blind to the truth?

712
00:41:18,876 --> 00:41:20,377
Oh, yeah?

713
00:41:20,878 --> 00:41:24,381
'Cause dominating minds speak
with the loudest voice?

714
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:27,384
- Oh, no?
- Good?

715
00:41:27,384 --> 00:41:29,887
But not everybody has
the luxury of choice?

716
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:31,889
Oh, no?

717
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:34,391
Some people search
for the holy grail?

I'm sheriff stanley.

720
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:40,898
I'm going door to door
and asking people...

721
00:41:40,898 --> 00:41:43,901
for information regarding
jenny tyler, the missing girl.

722
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:46,904
I wonder if you could just
take a look at a few pictures.

723
00:41:49,406 --> 00:41:53,911
If i don't use everything in my
power to block that entrance,

724
00:41:53,911 --> 00:41:57,414
innocent unborn
children will die.

725
00:41:57,414 --> 00:42:00,918
And if i have to kill
someone to stop that,

726
00:42:00,918 --> 00:42:04,922
well, that is what the right-to-life movement is all about.

727
00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:09,426
'Cause dominating minds
play judge and jury too?

728
00:42:09,426 --> 00:42:10,427
Oh, no?

native american--

733
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:26,443
heaven forbid,
i almost called them indian children--

734
00:42:26,443 --> 00:42:30,948
to blame our forefathers for all of their trouble,
instead of their own.

735
00:42:30,948 --> 00:42:35,452
Now, i'm the first to admit we
took this country from the indians.

736
00:42:35,452 --> 00:42:37,955
But what in the world were they doing with it anyway?

737
00:42:38,455 --> 00:42:41,458
Shooting off bows and arrows
and using seashells for money!

Baby, hey,
let's get together?

Honey, honey,
me and you?

741
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:55,472

Oh, do the things?

That we like to do?

Get down, get down?
Die!

serving me this filthy swine!

I can't eat this.

760
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:55,532
This is why the first thing
we must do...

761
00:43:55,532 --> 00:43:57,534
is eliminate
the traitors among us.

762
00:43:57,534 --> 00:44:01,038
Then we can concentrate
on the true enemy.

When the rain finally stopped,

00:44:10,047 --> 00:44:12,549
the water went down to its
normal level and it popped up.

Jack mayr,
with the leg brace, found it.

767

[Sheriff]
have you searched it?

768
00:44:16,553 --> 00:44:19,056
We're getting ready to.
I think there's some blood under the mat.

See that? Right there.
Yeah. Bring it up.

I wanna run a search
on the plates.

It's a little slick.

Hang on, jenny.
I'm getting closer.

773

You know, i never really
thought of it that way.

774

maybe you all are right.

00:51:19,476 --> 00:51:21,978
I honestly--
i don't remember.

855
00:51:21,978 --> 00:51:25,482
White man?
Black man? No.

856
00:51:26,483 --> 00:51:28,985
White. How do you
say-- medium build.

857
00:51:31,488 --> 00:51:33,490
Well, that truck
belonged to a known felon.

858
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:36,993
We found it dumped
next to the missouri river.

859
00:51:38,495 --> 00:51:40,997
I wanna show you
a couple of pictures and...

860
00:51:40,997 --> 00:51:42,999
maybe you can
identify the man.

861
00:51:53,009 --> 00:51:55,512
[Sheriff]
nothing?

862
00:51:55,512 --> 00:51:59,516
Oof.
No. Sorry.

863
00:51:59,516 --> 00:52:02,018
[Sighs]

864
00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:05,021
we found traces of blood
inside the truck.

865
00:52:07,524 --> 00:52:11,027
We're waiting for tests to see if it matches jenny tyler's.

866
00:52:11,528 --> 00:52:16,032
That little girl?
That would be horrible.

867
00:52:16,032 --> 00:52:18,034
I want you to think
about this really hard.

868
00:52:18,034 --> 00:52:21,037
If you can remember anything,
or you see this man again,

869
00:52:21,037 --> 00:52:23,039
i want you to call me
immediately.

870
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:24,541
Do you understand that?
Oh, of course.

871
00:52:26,543 --> 00:52:30,046
You should consider yourself
very lucky, mr. Vandoren.

872
00:52:30,046 --> 00:52:32,549
You might've been
this close to a murderer.

873
00:52:32,549 --> 00:52:35,552
Wow.

874
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:46,062
We've been thinking.
About us.

875
00:52:46,062 --> 00:52:50,567
You have?
Yes.

876
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:53,570
We don't feel that we're giving
people enough of a chance.

877
00:52:57,073 --> 00:53:00,577
Remember
the original plan?

878
00:53:00,577 --> 00:53:04,080
We said we wouldn't kill anyone
unless we couldn't change their minds.

879
00:53:04,581 --> 00:53:06,082
So we haven't changed
anyone's mind.

880
00:53:06,583 --> 00:53:09,085
Maybe we're not
as smart as we thought.

881
00:53:09,085 --> 00:53:11,588
Luke, the guy with the swastika sat down...

882
00:53:11,588 --> 00:53:13,590
and you told him
it was happy hour.

883
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:16,593
I figured
why waste the food.

884
00:53:16,593 --> 00:53:20,096
What food?
We're not even giving people a decent meal anymore.

885
00:53:20,597 --> 00:53:22,599
The fag basher
had chines e.

886
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:26,102
Chung king
is not chines e.

887
00:53:26,102 --> 00:53:29,105
We had soy sauce.
[Chuckles]

888
00:53:29,105 --> 00:53:31,608
let's just remember why we
started this in the first place.

889
00:53:31,608 --> 00:53:33,610
Yes, mass ah.

890
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:37,831
Catcher in the rye
is supposed to be art?

891
00:53:37,831 --> 00:53:39,833
Thumbelinais art.

892
00:53:40,333 --> 00:53:43,837
Catcher in the rye is just
mean-spirited garbage...

893
00:53:43,837 --> 00:53:47,340
littered with the "f" word.

894
00:53:50,343 --> 00:53:52,345
[Laughing]

895
00:53:54,848 --> 00:53:57,350
i've heard enough.
How 'bout a toast?

896
00:53:57,350 --> 00:53:59,352
Come on.
This is pathetic.

897
00:53:59,853 --> 00:54:01,354
Oh, come on.

898
00:54:01,855 --> 00:54:04,357
A toast.

899
00:54:04,357 --> 00:54:06,359
[Doorbell rings]

900
00:54:08,862 --> 00:54:10,864
i'll get it.

901
00:54:15,869 --> 00:54:17,871
Well, thank you.

902
00:54:17,871 --> 00:54:19,873
[Laughing]
[laughing]

903
00:54:27,881 --> 00:54:31,384
uh--
good evening, sir.

904
00:54:31,384 --> 00:54:33,887
I'm sorry to bother you
at the dinner hour...

905
00:54:33,887 --> 00:54:35,889
but i'm going house to house
to see if anyone...

906
00:54:35,889 --> 00:54:37,891
has any information
regarding jenny tyler.

907
00:54:37,891 --> 00:54:41,394
The kidnapped girl?
Right.

908
00:54:43,897 --> 00:54:47,400
I wonder if you'd look at some pictures.

909
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:50,403
Sure. You know,
i've got some company--

910
00:54:50,403 --> 00:54:53,907
it won't take
a minute.

911
00:55:06,419 --> 00:55:08,922
Have you seen
any of these men?

912
00:55:13,927 --> 00:55:16,930
What is it, hon?
Good evening.

913
00:55:19,432 --> 00:55:22,435
I'm sorry,
this is um-- i forgot your name.

914
00:55:22,435 --> 00:55:24,938
Don't worry, officer.
He's not driving.

915
00:55:24,938 --> 00:55:28,942
I trust you. Sheriff a lice stanley.
Paulie lay ton.

916
00:55:28,942 --> 00:55:33,446
My grandfather was chief of
police in maple falls way back.

917
00:55:33,446 --> 00:55:35,448
Maybe you'd like to look
through this stack...

918
00:55:35,448 --> 00:55:38,952
and see if you recognize any of the men in the pictures.

919
00:55:38,952 --> 00:55:40,954
Sir?

920
00:55:40,954 --> 00:55:43,456
He-- he--

921
00:55:44,958 --> 00:55:48,461
he-- he was chief of police for over 32 years.

922
00:55:48,962 --> 00:55:51,965
They called him big smoky.
He drank too.

923
00:55:51,965 --> 00:55:55,468
I'm sorry, sheriff,
but none of them...

924
00:55:55,468 --> 00:55:57,971
look like anyone
i would want to know.

925
00:55:57,971 --> 00:55:59,973
Pretty scary-looking bunch,
actually.

926
00:56:02,475 --> 00:56:04,978
I don't know
any of them.

927
00:56:04,978 --> 00:56:07,981
You stopped on this picture.
Have you seen this man before?

928
00:56:09,482 --> 00:56:10,984
Yeah--
no.

929
00:56:11,484 --> 00:56:13,987
I mean--
just--

930
00:56:13,987 --> 00:56:15,989
[crashing]

931
00:56:15,989 --> 00:56:18,491
what-- what was that?

932
00:56:18,992 --> 00:56:21,494
I don't know.
Honey, why don't you go see if our guests are all right.

933
00:56:21,494 --> 00:56:25,999
Sorry. Jude's okay,
but i think the dessert's about had it.

934
00:56:25,999 --> 00:56:29,502
- Good evening, mr. Vandoren.
- Hi, sheriff stanley.

935
00:56:29,502 --> 00:56:32,505
Is this the house where you
were dropped off that night?

936
00:56:32,505 --> 00:56:34,007
We're roommates.

937
00:56:34,507 --> 00:56:37,010
Well, maybe that's why this picture is familiar to you.

938
00:56:37,010 --> 00:56:39,012
Have you seen
this man before?

939
00:56:39,012 --> 00:56:41,014
No, they haven't.

940
00:56:41,014 --> 00:56:45,018
When he dropped me off that night,
you guys were all inside, remember?

941
00:56:45,018 --> 00:56:48,021
Yeah.
Oh, yeah. Um.

942
00:56:48,021 --> 00:56:51,024
Inside-- he was like dripping wet.
It was like wet--

943
00:56:51,024 --> 00:56:53,026
it was pouring out.

944
00:56:55,528 --> 00:56:59,032
You went through the stack pretty quickly.
Would you like to take another look?

945
00:56:59,032 --> 00:57:02,035
No. I told you,
they're very scary-looking.

946
00:57:02,035 --> 00:57:04,037
I've never seen
criminals like that.

947
00:57:05,538 --> 00:57:08,041
Your grandfather never had
any mug shots laying around?

948
00:57:08,541 --> 00:57:11,044
No. I died
long before he--

949
00:57:11,044 --> 00:57:14,047
i mean,
he died... [laughing]

950
00:57:14,047 --> 00:57:16,549
long before
i was born.

951
00:57:22,055 --> 00:57:24,057
Well, okay.

952
00:57:24,057 --> 00:57:26,059
Thank you.
Sure.

953
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:31,064
Oh, by the way, mr.
Vandoren, for your information...

954
00:57:31,064 --> 00:57:33,566
that blood we found
did check out.

955
00:57:35,068 --> 00:57:37,070
Wow.

956
00:57:37,070 --> 00:57:39,072
Thank you.

957
00:57:39,072 --> 00:57:41,074
Good night.

958
00:57:41,074 --> 00:57:43,076
Good night.
Good night.

959
00:57:50,083 --> 00:57:53,086
What the hell happened?
[Jude sobbing]

960
00:57:53,086 --> 00:57:56,089
- barbara doesn't drink wine.
- So this fucker stabbed her!

961
00:57:56,089 --> 00:57:58,591
[Paulie] pet e,
you were saying about the sheriff?

962
00:57:58,591 --> 00:58:00,593
What sheriff?
Let me explain.

963
00:58:00,593 --> 00:58:03,596
Outside.
The other day i got called in for questioning.

964
00:58:03,596 --> 00:58:05,598
Oh, fuck!
What?

965
00:58:05,598 --> 00:58:08,101
It's got nothing to do
with us, believe me.

966
00:58:08,101 --> 00:58:11,104
Remember that night with zack?
I left my car on the side of the road.

967
00:58:11,104 --> 00:58:15,608
I also left my rifle in the car
because i didn't want to scare zack.

968
00:58:16,109 --> 00:58:18,111
Well, the sheriff found the car.
She also found the rifle.

969
00:58:18,111 --> 00:58:20,613
She called me in.
It's no big deal.

970
00:58:20,613 --> 00:58:22,615
Not a big deal?
She had zack's picture.

971
00:58:22,615 --> 00:58:24,617
Yeah, i was
getting to that.

972
00:58:24,617 --> 00:58:27,620
They found zack's truck.
Oh, fuck!

973
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:29,622
When were you gonna
mention this, pet e?

974
00:58:29,622 --> 00:58:31,624
It's got nothing to do
with us. Listen.

975
00:58:31,624 --> 00:58:33,626
I got called in
because of the rifle.

976
00:58:33,626 --> 00:58:36,629
Completely separate from that,
they found zack's truck,

977
00:58:36,629 --> 00:58:40,633
with some of jenny tyler's blood in the backseat.

978
00:58:41,134 --> 00:58:43,136
Now, the sheriff,
she doesn't know zack's dead.

979
00:58:43,636 --> 00:58:45,138
So she's looking
everywhere for him,

980
00:58:45,638 --> 00:58:47,640
because he probably killed
that poor little girl.

981
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:49,642
Oh, fuck.

982
00:58:51,144 --> 00:58:53,646
[Pete] we did some good then.
Of course we did.

983
00:58:53,646 --> 00:58:55,648
You were right, luke. Hey!

984
00:58:55,648 --> 00:58:58,151
Hooray for us!
No.

985
00:58:58,151 --> 00:59:00,153
What if they trace
zack back to here?

986
00:59:00,153 --> 00:59:02,155
No. That's not going
to happen, jude.

987
00:59:02,155 --> 00:59:04,657
They found the truck,
andthatwas not supposed to happen.

988
00:59:05,158 --> 00:59:09,162
- She's right.
- Maybe this is a sign that we should slow down.

989
00:59:09,162 --> 00:59:12,165
Paranoia will destroy ya?
Fuck you guys!

990
00:59:12,165 --> 00:59:16,169
We got rid of a child murderer,
and you're acting like we've done something wrong.

991
00:59:16,169 --> 00:59:19,672
What if zack had lived?
We stopped him before he killed anyone else.

992
00:59:19,672 --> 00:59:21,674
Isn't that why we started
this in the first place?

993
00:59:21,674 --> 00:59:24,677
But look at her.

994
00:59:24,677 --> 00:59:28,181
She was just an illiterate. I mean,
we're getting out of hand.

995
00:59:28,181 --> 00:59:31,184
We've been careful, marc.
No one's going to touch us.

996
00:59:31,184 --> 00:59:34,687
We have to slow down.
Slow down.

997
00:59:34,687 --> 00:59:36,689
We have killed
nine people.

998
00:59:36,689 --> 00:59:40,193
- Ten people.
- Nine. I was an accounting major once.

999
00:59:40,193 --> 00:59:42,195
- It's only nine.
- It's ten.

1000
00:59:42,195 --> 00:59:44,197
- It's nine!
- [Luke] pet e?

1001
00:59:48,201 --> 00:59:50,703
- Ten.
- You are not gonna count zack.

1002
00:59:50,703 --> 00:59:53,206
He was the first one.
[Marc] he was an accident.

1003
00:59:53,206 --> 00:59:55,708
If he's in the garden,
it counts. That's the rule.

1004
00:59:56,209 --> 00:59:58,711
- You are fucking crazy.
- There are no rules, okay?

1005
00:59:58,711 --> 01:00:01,214
We are killing people,
for god's sakes.

1006
01:00:01,214 --> 01:00:03,216
They're not people.
They're people who hate.

1007
01:00:03,216 --> 01:00:05,218
What are you talking about?
Give me a break.

1008
01:00:05,218 --> 01:00:07,720
She just had bad taste.
I didn't kill you for that haircut.

1009
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:11,224
That's a good one coming from a fashion victim like you,
you fucking nun!

1010
01:00:11,224 --> 01:00:13,726
All i'm saying is we have to think more.
Think!

1011
01:00:14,227 --> 01:00:16,229
"Hooray for us"?
Come on. Wake up!

1012
01:00:16,229 --> 01:00:17,730
All right!
All right!

1013
01:00:23,736 --> 01:00:27,240
Let's just get rid
of miss mens a here.

1014
01:00:52,265 --> 01:00:54,267
Just go
to sleep, okay?

1015
01:00:56,769 --> 01:00:58,771
[Sighs]

1016
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:09,782
you might recognize heather from the newspaper.

1017
01:01:09,782 --> 01:01:11,284
She's the one
suing her high school.

1018
01:01:11,784 --> 01:01:16,789
Oh. That's right.
The condom thing.

1019
01:01:16,789 --> 01:01:20,293
Well, that's how the press
has simplified it.

1020
01:01:20,293 --> 01:01:22,295
Actually, i'm suing
the school...

1021
01:01:22,295 --> 01:01:26,799
because they're violating my
constitutional right to privacy...

1022
01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:31,304
by making sexual education mandatory for graduation.

1023
01:01:31,304 --> 01:01:34,807
I'm sure that's going to get
you a lot of publicity, heather.

1024
01:01:34,807 --> 01:01:37,310
But, in legal terms,
your case...

1025
01:01:37,810 --> 01:01:40,813
is what we call,
"bullshit."

1026
01:01:40,813 --> 01:01:42,815
[Laughing]

1027
01:01:42,815 --> 01:01:45,318
why? That's the way
things ought a be.

1028
01:01:45,318 --> 01:01:47,320
Well, number one,
the court understands...

1029
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:50,323
that especially in this
day and age of aids,

1030
01:01:50,323 --> 01:01:52,825
sexual education
must be mandatory...

1031
01:01:53,326 --> 01:01:54,827
to insure
the public safety.

1032
01:01:55,328 --> 01:01:57,330
- No, that's not so.
- Oh, no?

1033
01:01:57,330 --> 01:02:00,833
No. I don't go to those classes,
and i'm perfectly safe.

1034
01:02:01,334 --> 01:02:03,836
[Laughing]

1035
01:02:03,836 --> 01:02:05,838
[heather] sexual education and free condoms...

1036
01:02:05,838 --> 01:02:07,840
sends the message
to kids my age...

1037
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:09,842
that they should be having premarital sex.

1038
01:02:10,343 --> 01:02:12,845
But, heather, you're
a high school senior.

1039
01:02:12,845 --> 01:02:15,848
I mean, when i was in high school,
i was curious.

1040
01:02:15,848 --> 01:02:18,351
Yeah. I'm sure you were.
Shut up.

1041
01:02:18,351 --> 01:02:20,853
[Laughing]

1042
01:02:20,853 --> 01:02:22,855
don't you ever have
any of those feelings?

1043
01:02:22,855 --> 01:02:24,857
They can be
really nice.

1044
01:02:24,857 --> 01:02:26,859
No offense, ma'am,

1045
01:02:26,859 --> 01:02:29,862
but that curiosity
isn't human nature...

1046
01:02:29,862 --> 01:02:32,365
but rather
your generation s's...

1047
01:02:32,365 --> 01:02:35,368
lower standard of morality that
has put my generation at risk.

1048
01:02:35,868 --> 01:02:39,372
Heather, you're not
hearing me.

1049
01:02:39,372 --> 01:02:42,875
I see a great danger in the world,
and i want to stop it.

1050
01:02:42,875 --> 01:02:45,878
[Heather] we have to get back
to family values in this country.

1051
01:02:45,878 --> 01:02:49,382
Heather,
have you ever had sex?

1052
01:02:49,382 --> 01:02:51,384
Luke!

1053
01:02:51,384 --> 01:02:54,387
That's a very inappropriate question for the dinner table.

1054
01:02:54,387 --> 01:02:57,890
- How can you sit there all of seventeen...
- seventeen and a half!

1055
01:02:57,890 --> 01:03:00,393
And preach to me about family
values and sexual education?

1056
01:03:00,393 --> 01:03:02,395
You don't even know
what it's like to have sex.

1057
01:03:02,395 --> 01:03:05,898
I knew girls like you in high school.
So pretty and so stuck up...

1058
01:03:05,898 --> 01:03:08,901
to all the guys
afraid to ask you out.

1059
01:03:08,901 --> 01:03:11,904
You know what you need, heather?
You know what you really need?

1060
01:03:11,904 --> 01:03:15,408
- You need a good stiff dick. That'll shut that mouth.
- [Jude] luke!

1061
01:03:15,408 --> 01:03:17,910
- Oh, shit!
- Shut up, luke!

1062
01:03:17,910 --> 01:03:19,912
All right.
I'm sorry.

1063
01:03:20,413 --> 01:03:22,915
- How 'bout a glass of wine, heather? Loosen you up.
- Hey!

1064
01:03:22,915 --> 01:03:25,418
- I don't drink.
- One little sip ain't gonna kill you, baby.

1065
01:03:25,418 --> 01:03:27,420
What's the matter
with you?

1066
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:30,423
- Hey, nothing. Let's just drink and get this over with.
- I don't think so!

1067
01:03:30,423 --> 01:03:32,925
Why is he so mean?

1068
01:03:33,426 --> 01:03:35,928
Let's not let luke's little outburst cloud the issue here.

1069
01:03:35,928 --> 01:03:38,931
- That's exactly it.
- Would you just cool it for a minute?

1070
01:03:38,931 --> 01:03:42,435
Can't you see that
we've upset her?

1071
01:03:42,435 --> 01:03:46,439
- You better shut your mouth.
- I'm going to walk heather out.

1072
01:03:46,439 --> 01:03:49,942
- That would be a bad idea, jude.
- No. I want to go.

1073
01:03:53,946 --> 01:03:55,948
[Luke]
i don't think so.

1074
01:04:00,453 --> 01:04:02,955
- [Jude] she's a child!
- Hitler was a child once too!

1075
01:04:03,456 --> 01:04:05,458
We're get tin' too emotional!
That's funny, coming from you.

1076
01:04:05,458 --> 01:04:07,460
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

1077
01:04:07,460 --> 01:04:10,463
[Laughs] you better shut your mouth,
or i'll break your other arm.

1078
01:04:10,463 --> 01:04:12,465
Shut up!

1079
01:04:16,969 --> 01:04:18,971
Ooh! Oh!

1080
01:04:20,973 --> 01:04:24,477
That's new.
Actually attacking someone when you're facing them.

1081
01:04:24,477 --> 01:04:26,479
Stop it!

1082
01:04:26,479 --> 01:04:29,482
Would you two stop it!
Big dick!

1083
01:04:33,486 --> 01:04:35,488
[Jude] come on, heather.
Let me take you home.

1084
01:04:35,988 --> 01:04:37,857
[Marc] we'll figure this out after the break.

1085
01:05:03,516 --> 01:05:07,520
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Those are mine.

1086
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:11,023
Getting rid of your lovely little borders here.

1087
01:05:11,023 --> 01:05:14,527
Why don't you just put up a sign saying, "cemetery.
Bodies buried here"?

1088
01:05:14,527 --> 01:05:16,529
Why don't you mind your
own fucking business?

1089
01:05:16,529 --> 01:05:20,032
I am minding my own fucking business,
and you need to get your shit together.

1090
01:05:20,032 --> 01:05:23,035
I got my shit together fine.
Don't worry about that.

1091
01:05:25,037 --> 01:05:27,540
Travel agent's
on the phone for you.

1092
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:31,043
Going to guyana
over the break?

1093
01:05:33,045 --> 01:05:36,549
Yes. Spring break
in guyana.

1094
01:05:37,049 --> 01:05:38,551
You enjoy
yourself, huh?

1095
01:05:39,051 --> 01:05:40,553
After you.

1096
01:05:41,053 --> 01:05:43,556
Oh, no.
After you.

1097
01:05:48,561 --> 01:05:50,563
Bitch!

1098
01:06:46,118 --> 01:06:48,120
Can i help you?

1099
01:06:51,624 --> 01:06:54,627
Hi. I'm
sheriff stanley.

1100
01:06:54,627 --> 01:06:57,129
Are you trespassing,

1101
01:06:57,129 --> 01:06:59,632
or just interested
in olericulture?

1102
01:06:59,632 --> 01:07:04,136
What?
Olericulture, the growing of vegetables.

1103
01:07:04,136 --> 01:07:07,139
Yes.
Olericulture.

1104
01:07:07,139 --> 01:07:09,141
I've never tasted
tomatoes this sweet.

1105
01:07:09,642 --> 01:07:11,143
Thank you.

1106
01:07:11,644 --> 01:07:13,145
Is it something you put in the soil?

1107
01:07:13,646 --> 01:07:15,648
No. Just
good topsoil.

1108
01:07:16,148 --> 01:07:19,652
Gotta keep the earth moving,
my grandmother always said.

1109
01:07:20,653 --> 01:07:23,155
Is that why everything
looks so dug up?

1110
01:07:23,155 --> 01:07:25,157
Shh.

1111
01:07:27,159 --> 01:07:29,161
It's a secret.

1112
01:07:29,662 --> 01:07:33,165
Don't let it out,
or everyone will start growing these things.

1113
01:07:37,169 --> 01:07:40,172
Well, don't worry.
Your secret's safe with me.

1114
01:07:41,674 --> 01:07:44,677
My business
is almost done here.

1115
01:07:46,178 --> 01:07:48,180
Your business?

1116
01:07:48,180 --> 01:07:52,184
The jenny tyler case.
Haven't your roommates told you?

1117
01:07:52,685 --> 01:07:54,186
Oh, yes.

1118
01:07:54,687 --> 01:07:56,188
That girl.

1119
01:08:00,192 --> 01:08:02,194
I think she's dead.

1120
01:08:03,696 --> 01:08:05,698
Well, there's always
hope, isn't there?

1121
01:08:10,703 --> 01:08:12,705
Have a good day.

1122
01:08:59,752 --> 01:09:02,254
Rain, rain, rain?

1123
01:09:02,254 --> 01:09:07,760
The wicked rain
fall in' from the sky?

1124
01:09:09,261 --> 01:09:11,764
Down, down, down?

1125
01:09:11,764 --> 01:09:15,768
Pourin' down
upon the night?

1126
01:09:17,770 --> 01:09:20,773
Well, there's just one chance
in a million?

1127
01:09:20,773 --> 01:09:25,778
That someday
we'll make it out alive?

1128
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:31,283
Rain, rain, rain?

1129
01:09:31,283 --> 01:09:35,287
The evil rain
fall in' all the time?

1130
01:09:37,790 --> 01:09:40,793
Sun, sun, sun?
Damn.

1131
01:09:40,793 --> 01:09:44,296
Sun don't ever
want to shine?

1132
01:09:46,799 --> 01:09:49,802
Well, there'll be no light
in the morn in'?

1133
01:09:49,802 --> 01:09:53,806
'Less some peace
at last we find?

1134
01:09:56,809 --> 01:09:59,812
Like prowlers
in the darkness?

1135
01:09:59,812 --> 01:10:01,814
Can't see our way?

1136
01:10:01,814 --> 01:10:06,819
Proud to make it
through another day?

1137
01:10:06,819 --> 01:10:09,321
Fa-fa-father?

1138
01:10:09,321 --> 01:10:13,826
Why do you let your sons
go astray?

1139
01:10:15,828 --> 01:10:18,330
Br-br-brother?

1140
01:10:18,330 --> 01:10:22,334
Why must we go on this way?

1141
01:10:25,337 --> 01:10:27,840
There's a storm
up in the distance?

1142
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:31,844
And it looks like
it's here to stay?

1143
01:10:33,846 --> 01:10:35,848
Mr. Arbuthnot?

1144
01:10:39,351 --> 01:10:41,353
Thank you.

1145
01:10:54,366 --> 01:10:57,870
Oh, we don't have-- we don't-- we don't have a book.

1146
01:10:57,870 --> 01:11:00,873
Oh, well,
i'll have to call my publisher...

1147
01:11:00,873 --> 01:11:02,875
and have him send more down here immediately.

1148
01:11:04,376 --> 01:11:06,879
That's the price
of greatness.

1149
01:11:06,879 --> 01:11:08,881
I think it's more the boredom of travel,

1150
01:11:08,881 --> 01:11:10,883
but thanks anyway
for the compliment.

1151
01:11:10,883 --> 01:11:12,885
No, no.
You are a great man.

1152
01:11:12,885 --> 01:11:14,887
Well,
i'm a loud man,

1153
01:11:14,887 --> 01:11:17,890
but thanks again.

1154
01:11:19,391 --> 01:11:22,394
Say, uh, you fellas
wouldn't know...

1155
01:11:22,394 --> 01:11:24,897
where a guy could get a decent meal around here,
would you?

1156
01:11:24,897 --> 01:11:26,899
Yes.
Yes.

1157
01:11:29,401 --> 01:11:32,404
[Paulie] can you believe that norman
arbuthnot was at the airport?

1158
01:11:32,404 --> 01:11:35,407
[Jude] i'm sure it's a real bitch
flying your own private jet.

1159
01:11:35,407 --> 01:11:37,409
How many drops
does luke put in?

1160
01:11:37,409 --> 01:11:39,411
I think
just a few.

1161
01:11:39,912 --> 01:11:41,413
Well, fuck that.

1162
01:11:42,915 --> 01:11:44,416
[Luke]
mr. Arbuthnot?

1163
01:11:45,918 --> 01:11:48,420
Would you like
to say grace?

1164
01:11:52,925 --> 01:11:56,929
I didn't know people
said grace anymore.

1165
01:11:56,929 --> 01:11:59,431
[Weak laughter]

1166
01:12:01,433 --> 01:12:05,938
we don't usually,
but we just thought you might be used to it.

1167
01:12:05,938 --> 01:12:08,440
Oh, for god's sake, no.

1168
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:11,944
No. If anything,
i think we ought to...

1169
01:12:11,944 --> 01:12:15,948
bow our heads and thank paulie
for such an incredible spread.

1170
01:12:20,953 --> 01:12:22,955
Bon appetit.

1171
01:12:24,957 --> 01:12:28,460
You know, i'm forever amused by
these people from the christian right...

1172
01:12:28,961 --> 01:12:30,963
who thank god for everything that's good...

1173
01:12:30,963 --> 01:12:33,465
and blame humankind
for everything that's bad.

1174
01:12:34,466 --> 01:12:37,469
Mmm.
May i?

1175
01:12:46,979 --> 01:12:49,982
But isn't the christian right your strongest supporter?

1176
01:12:50,482 --> 01:12:52,484
Most people always need
somebody to follow.

1177
01:12:52,985 --> 01:12:54,987
They can never
do anything on their own.

1178
01:12:56,989 --> 01:12:58,991
Of course,

1179
01:12:58,991 --> 01:13:03,495
the moral majority makes up a huge
contingent of the republican right.

1180
01:13:03,495 --> 01:13:07,499
They do, but they
have very little power.

1181
01:13:07,499 --> 01:13:10,002
I mean, they make
the most noise,

1182
01:13:10,002 --> 01:13:12,504
but the centrists
do all the work.

1183
01:13:12,504 --> 01:13:15,007
The extremes of both parties
grab all the headlines,

1184
01:13:15,507 --> 01:13:18,010
but all the decisions
are made by the moderates.

1185
01:13:20,512 --> 01:13:24,016
Well, that seems to go against
most people's perceptions.

1186
01:13:24,016 --> 01:13:27,519
Only naive
people.

1187
01:13:30,022 --> 01:13:33,525
Listen, i can rant and rave
with the best of them,

1188
01:13:33,525 --> 01:13:35,527
but how else
am i gonna get heard?

1189
01:13:35,527 --> 01:13:37,529
I'm not an elected representative of this republic.

1190
01:13:37,529 --> 01:13:41,033
I'm just a concerned citizen that sees certain
things wrong and wants to change them.

1191
01:13:41,033 --> 01:13:43,035
That's what's great
about this country.

1192
01:13:43,035 --> 01:13:45,037
But your views
are extreme,

1193
01:13:45,037 --> 01:13:47,039
and extreme views incite
people to extreme measures.

1194
01:13:47,539 --> 01:13:50,042
I can't be held responsible
for every nut case...

1195
01:13:50,042 --> 01:13:53,045
who thinks i mean something
when i mean something else.

1196
01:13:53,045 --> 01:13:57,049
Look, i admit to sometimes throwing in
some pretty outrageous arguments...

1197
01:13:57,549 --> 01:14:00,552
to support my positions,
but hey, man,

1198
01:14:00,552 --> 01:14:03,055
it's the ratings thing,
you know?

1199
01:14:05,557 --> 01:14:07,559
Besides, the average citizen knows what i'm doing.

1200
01:14:07,559 --> 01:14:09,561
What are
you doing?

1201
01:14:11,563 --> 01:14:15,067
Dissent.
Being the voice of dissent.

1202
01:14:16,568 --> 01:14:20,572
Jefferson, monroe, pain e.
They were all critics.

1203
01:14:20,572 --> 01:14:24,076
Pundits, if you will,
before they were the power.

1204
01:14:24,076 --> 01:14:27,079
This is excellent wine by the way.
Willowcrest mer lot?

1205
01:14:27,079 --> 01:14:30,082
Is that
what you want, norman?

1206
01:14:30,082 --> 01:14:32,084
Power?

1207
01:14:32,084 --> 01:14:34,586
To be president?

1208
01:14:36,088 --> 01:14:39,591
Luke, i already
have power.

1209
01:14:39,591 --> 01:14:42,594
The president? Ha!

1210
01:14:42,594 --> 01:14:45,097
He doesn't
have any power.

1211
01:14:45,097 --> 01:14:48,100
He's gotta answer to congress,
the special interests, the courts.

1212
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:52,604
- To the people?
- Well, to a lesser degree to the people.

1213
01:14:52,604 --> 01:14:56,108
But i got power.
One voice, one vote.

1214
01:14:56,608 --> 01:15:00,112
But your followers. They hate anyone who
disagrees with you and your opinions.

1215
01:15:00,112 --> 01:15:02,114
Well, followers of nelson mandela commit murder.

1216
01:15:02,114 --> 01:15:04,116
Followers of gandhi
kill people.

1217
01:15:04,116 --> 01:15:06,618
You compare yourself
to mandela and gandhi?

1218
01:15:06,618 --> 01:15:08,620
No. Those are great men.
Paulie's the one...

1219
01:15:08,620 --> 01:15:12,124
that suggested i have followers,
as if i could control what people do.

1220
01:15:12,624 --> 01:15:14,126
People do what
they want to do.

1221
01:15:14,626 --> 01:15:16,128
Like hate?

1222
01:15:16,628 --> 01:15:19,631
Well, it's true you have some harmful people...

1223
01:15:19,631 --> 01:15:22,634
on both the extreme left
and the extreme right.

1224
01:15:22,634 --> 01:15:25,637
But i suggest that
the more extreme...

1225
01:15:26,138 --> 01:15:28,640
those opposites get,
the more moderate this society becomes.

1226
01:15:29,141 --> 01:15:31,643
Because when you average out all those extremes,

1227
01:15:31,643 --> 01:15:35,147
you come out with a society that's
pretty well anchored in the middle,

1228
01:15:35,147 --> 01:15:37,149
and that's what
we all want, isn't it--

1229
01:15:37,149 --> 01:15:40,652
a society where
all of us can live?

1230
01:15:41,153 --> 01:15:43,655
All races,
all religions,

1231
01:15:43,655 --> 01:15:46,658
all views
living together,

1232
01:15:46,658 --> 01:15:49,661
forging ahead
as one.

1233
01:15:49,661 --> 01:15:53,165
Look, in any society,
no matter how big or small,

1234
01:15:53,165 --> 01:15:55,667
you're gonna have dissent.

1235
01:15:55,667 --> 01:15:57,669
I mean, look at
the five of you.

1236
01:15:57,669 --> 01:16:00,172
Can you honestly say
you agree on everything?

1237
01:16:06,678 --> 01:16:10,682
So, how is any good
supposed to get done?

1238
01:16:10,682 --> 01:16:15,187
My friend,
i do not presume to know the answer to that one.

1239
01:16:15,187 --> 01:16:17,689
All i know is you gotta
do the best you can do.

1240
01:16:17,689 --> 01:16:20,192
You have to be the best individual selves you can be.

1241
01:16:20,692 --> 01:16:22,194
Otherwise,
why bother, right?

1242
01:16:22,694 --> 01:16:25,197
Anything else turns
the world to pure manure.

1243
01:16:25,197 --> 01:16:28,200
Um, i don't think you should drink that one.

1244
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:31,203
It's been out for a little while.
It's probably gone bad.

1245
01:16:31,203 --> 01:16:33,205
I think
the wine is fine.

1246
01:16:33,205 --> 01:16:36,208
Well, i would never be
rude enough...

1247
01:16:36,208 --> 01:16:38,710
to ignore the suggestion
of a lady.

1248
01:16:38,710 --> 01:16:40,712
Thank you, jude.

1249
01:16:47,219 --> 01:16:49,221
It's 1909.

1250
01:16:49,221 --> 01:16:51,223
You're in austria,
and you're alone...

1251
01:16:51,223 --> 01:16:53,725
with a young artist
named adolf hitler.

1252
01:16:54,226 --> 01:16:55,727
[Norman]
mm-h mm.

1253
01:16:56,228 --> 01:16:58,230
Do you kill him?

1254
01:16:58,230 --> 01:17:01,733
Do you murder him there even
though he hasn't done anything yet?

1255
01:17:01,733 --> 01:17:04,736
Because you know you'll save
all those millions of people.

1256
01:17:19,251 --> 01:17:21,253
Absolutely not.

1257
01:17:21,253 --> 01:17:23,755
You'd let people die knowing you
could do something about it?

1258
01:17:23,755 --> 01:17:26,258
I didn't say that.

1259
01:17:26,758 --> 01:17:29,261
What i said was--
you don't say anything.

1260
01:17:29,261 --> 01:17:32,264
You just talk and talk and say nothing so many times...

1261
01:17:32,264 --> 01:17:34,766
that people think
you're saying something.

1262
01:17:39,771 --> 01:17:42,274
What i would do, luke,

1263
01:17:42,274 --> 01:17:45,777
if you would let me finish,
is talk to the man.

1264
01:17:46,278 --> 01:17:50,282
Try to show him the error of his
ways to the best of my ability.

1265
01:17:50,282 --> 01:17:53,785
Challenge his ideas.
Exchange thoughts.

1266
01:17:53,785 --> 01:17:58,290
Provoke change
by intelligent debate.

1267
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:17,809
I'll be right back.

1268
01:18:21,313 --> 01:18:23,315
Uh, i gotta get
some dessert.

1269
01:18:23,815 --> 01:18:25,317
I'll help.

1270
01:18:25,817 --> 01:18:29,321
[Thunderclap]

1271
01:18:33,825 --> 01:18:36,828
i have to get something for somebody.

1272
01:18:48,340 --> 01:18:50,342
We are not gonna do this, right? Right.

1273
01:18:50,842 --> 01:18:53,345
We got the king
in our grasp.

1274
01:18:53,345 --> 01:18:55,347
Have you heard a word the man said?

1275
01:18:55,347 --> 01:18:57,349
Don't you see that he's right?
We're wrong.

1276
01:18:57,349 --> 01:19:00,352
Don't tell me you're falling for this shit.
He's sat an.

1277
01:19:00,352 --> 01:19:02,354
I don't know.
He's making some sense.

1278
01:19:02,354 --> 01:19:05,357
You blow like the wind.
He's giving us prepared speech.

1279
01:19:05,357 --> 01:19:08,860
He's so used to defending himself,
he's got a pat answer for everything we throw at him.

1280
01:19:08,860 --> 01:19:10,862
He is an iceman!

1281
01:19:10,862 --> 01:19:14,366
Maybe we're wrong about him.
Maybe he just does this for money and publicity.

1282
01:19:14,366 --> 01:19:16,368
You fucking imbecile.
Like that's better. That's worse!

1283
01:19:16,368 --> 01:19:19,371
Creating all this hate
for the dollar? Come on!

1284
01:19:19,371 --> 01:19:22,374
We've got norman arbuthnot
in the palm of our hands.

1285
01:19:42,394 --> 01:19:45,397
Can you hear yourself?
You sound like a fucking crazy man.

1286
01:19:45,397 --> 01:19:47,399
Is it crazy to make
a difference?

1287
01:19:47,399 --> 01:19:49,901
Is it crazy putting these assholes in their places?

1288
01:19:49,901 --> 01:19:52,404
Can't you see
through his shit?

1289
01:19:52,404 --> 01:19:55,907
Being full of shit is not a good enough reason to kill him.

1290
01:19:55,907 --> 01:19:58,410
It isn't the right thing to do.

1291
01:20:02,914 --> 01:20:06,418
You guys are all turning into
the fucking step ford wives.

1292
01:21:03,475 --> 01:21:05,977
Well, this is
getting us nowhere.

1293
01:21:05,977 --> 01:21:08,480
I'm sorry, luke,
but you have to have unanimous consent,

1294
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:10,482
and it's four to one
that he lives, so--

1295
01:21:10,982 --> 01:21:14,486
i'm sorry too, marc, because
he's not gonna fucking live,

1296
01:21:14,986 --> 01:21:17,989
and nobody
is gonna stop me.

1297
01:21:17,989 --> 01:21:19,991
What the fuck
you doing?

1298
01:21:19,991 --> 01:21:22,994
Oh, my god!

1299
01:21:22,994 --> 01:21:25,497
He's hitler.

1300
01:21:25,497 --> 01:21:28,500
What are you doing
with the gun?

1301
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:32,504
He's hitler, and your deaths won't make
the world a better place, but his will.

1302
01:21:33,004 --> 01:21:34,506
So just get out
of my way.

1303
01:21:35,006 --> 01:21:36,508
Where'd you get
that gun?

1304
01:21:36,508 --> 01:21:39,010
The sheriff.

1305
01:21:39,010 --> 01:21:42,013
- What sheriff?
- Oh, my god. The sheriff.

1306
01:21:42,013 --> 01:21:44,516
- The sher--
- the sheriff's missing.

1307
01:21:44,516 --> 01:21:47,018
- Not anymore.
- Oh, jesus.

1308
01:21:48,019 --> 01:21:49,521
What did you do?

1309
01:21:49,521 --> 01:21:53,024
She was onto us.
She was sneaking around in the family plot.

1310
01:21:53,024 --> 01:21:56,027
You killed a cop?

01:21:56,027 --> 01:21:58,029
You rather i didn't?

1312
01:21:58,029 --> 01:22:01,032

i thought we were all
together on this--

1315
01:22:39,070 --> 01:22:44,576
serious-- that what we were
doing was something great.

1316
01:22:44,576 --> 01:22:46,578
Now, i'm sorry
she had to die.

1317
01:22:48,580 --> 01:22:50,582
But she was
in our way.

1318
01:22:54,085 --> 01:22:56,588
What are you doing?

01:22:56,588 --> 01:22:59,591
Well, since you've completely lost it,
i'm calling the cops.

No. No.

- So shoot me.

No! Luke!

01:25:47,258 --> 01:25:49,761
aren't you going
to join us?

1354
01:25:49,761 --> 01:25:52,764
No, no, no, no. Please, please.
I've had more than enough.

1355
01:25:53,264 --> 01:25:54,766
Besides, i don't want you guys
waking up to the headline,

1356
01:25:55,266 --> 01:25:59,270
"old windbag, forced to have last drink,
crashes private plane."

1357
01:25:59,270 --> 01:26:01,272
[All laugh]

1358
01:26:01,272 --> 01:26:03,274
isn't it bad luck to toast without wine?

1359
01:26:03,274 --> 01:26:05,777
Not in china.

1360
01:26:09,781 --> 01:26:11,282
[Laughing]

1361
01:26:14,285 --> 01:26:16,788
anyway,
to your health.

1362
01:27:00,331 --> 01:27:02,834
[Cheering]

1363
01:27:02,834 --> 01:27:04,836
[norman] you know,
wherever i travel...

1364
01:27:04,836 --> 01:27:06,838
in this bountiful
land of ours,

1365
01:27:06,838 --> 01:27:08,840
the question on everybody's mind seems to be...

1366
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:10,842
will i make a run...

1367
01:27:10,842 --> 01:27:13,845
for this country's
highest office?

1368
01:27:13,845 --> 01:27:15,847
Well,
my friends,

1369
01:27:15,847 --> 01:27:17,849
some people
would say...

1370
01:27:17,849 --> 01:27:20,852
i already have.

1371
01:27:20,852 --> 01:27:22,854
At any rate,
all i would like to say...

1372
01:27:22,854 --> 01:27:24,856
to you well-wishers
out there...

1373
01:27:24,856 --> 01:27:27,358
is that i shall do whatever the people want me to do,

1374
01:27:27,358 --> 01:27:31,863
because i am your humble,
humble servant.

1375
01:27:54,886 --> 01:28:00,391
Such a feeling
coming over me?

1376
01:28:00,391 --> 01:28:05,396
There is wonder
in the things i see?

1377
01:28:05,396 --> 01:28:07,899
Not a cloud in the sky?

1378
01:28:08,399 --> 01:28:10,902
Got the sun in my eyes?

1379
01:28:10,902 --> 01:28:16,908
And i won't be surprised
if it's a dream?

1380
01:28:16,908 --> 01:28:22,413
Everything i want
the world to be?

1381
01:28:22,413 --> 01:28:27,418
Is coming true
especially for me?

1382
01:28:27,919 --> 01:28:29,921
And the reason is clear?

1383
01:28:30,421 --> 01:28:32,924
It's because you are here?

1384
01:28:32,924 --> 01:28:39,430
You're the nearest thing
to heaven that i've seen?

1385
01:28:39,430 --> 01:28:40,932
I'm on top of the world?

1386
01:28:41,432 --> 01:28:43,935
Looking down on creation?

1387
01:28:43,935 --> 01:28:49,440
And the only explanation
i can find?

1388
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:51,943
Is the love
that i've found?

1389
01:28:51,943 --> 01:28:55,446
Ever since
you've been around?

1390
01:28:55,947 --> 01:28:58,950
Your love puts me?

1391
01:28:58,950 --> 01:29:01,452
On the top of the world?

1392
01:29:01,452 --> 01:29:04,455
Top of the world?

1393
01:29:04,956 --> 01:29:06,958
Top of the world?

1394
01:29:06,958 --> 01:29:08,459
Top of the world?

1395
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:16,968


1396
01:29:16,968 --> 01:29:24,976


1397
01:29:24,976 --> 01:29:29,981
Something in the wind
has learned my name?

1398
01:29:29,981 --> 01:29:34,986
Telling me that things
are not the same?

1399
01:29:34,986 --> 01:29:37,488
It's the leaves on the trees

1400
01:29:37,989 --> 01:29:40,491
And the touch of the breeze?
?

1401
01:29:40,491 --> 01:29:46,497
There's a pleasant
sense of happiness for me?

1402
01:29:46,497 --> 01:29:52,003
There is only one wish
on my mind?

1403
01:29:52,003 --> 01:29:57,508
When this day is through
i hope i'll find?

1404
01:29:57,508 --> 01:30:02,513
Tomorrow will be
the same for you and me?

1405
01:30:02,513 --> 01:30:09,020
All i need will be mine
if you are here?

1406
01:30:09,020 --> 01:30:13,524
I'm on top of the world
looking down on creation?

1407
01:30:13,524 --> 01:30:19,030
And the only explanation
i can find?

1408
01:30:19,030 --> 01:30:21,532
Is the love that i found?

1409
01:30:21,532 --> 01:30:25,036
Ever since
you've been around?

1410
01:30:25,036 --> 01:30:28,039
Your love puts me?

1411
01:30:28,539 --> 01:30:31,042
On the top of the world?

1412
01:30:31,042 --> 01:30:34,045
Top of the world?

1413
01:30:34,045 --> 01:30:36,547
Top of the world?

1414
01:30:36,547 --> 01:30:39,550
Top of the world?

1415
01:30:39,550 --> 01:30:42,053
Top of the world?

1416
01:30:42,553 --> 01:30:45,056
Top of the world?

1417
01:30:45,056 --> 01:30:48,059
Top of the world?

1418
01:30:56,067 --> 01:30:57,068
Top of the world?

1419
01:30:57,568 --> 01:31:01,572
Such a feeling coming
over me now?

1420
01:31:01,572 --> 01:31:02,573
Top of the world?

1421
01:31:03,074 --> 01:31:07,078
Everything i want
the world to be now?

1422
01:31:07,078 --> 01:31:09,080
On top of the world?

1423
01:31:09,080 --> 01:31:12,583
On top
top of the world?

1424
01:31:12,583 --> 01:31:14,085
Top of the world?

1425
01:31:14,085 --> 01:31:17,588
I'm on top now
i'm on the top now?

1426
01:31:17,588 --> 01:31:20,091
Yeah, top of the world?

1427
01:31:20,091 --> 01:31:23,594
I'm on top, top
top, top, top?

1428
01:31:23,594 --> 01:31:24,595
Top of the world?
