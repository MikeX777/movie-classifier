CONGRATULATIONS.

713
00:28:36,652 --> 00:28:38,045
YEAH, THANK YOU.
IT'S AMBER WILSON.

714
00:28:38,069 --> 00:28:39,295
WE'RE VERY HAPPY.

715
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:41,253
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE
THE MOST LOVELY WEDDING EVER,

716
00:28:41,277 --> 00:28:42,836
AND YOU'RE GOING TO HELP ME,
BECAUSE YOU ARE HERE.

717
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:43,836
I WOULD LOVE TO HELP.

718
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,836
OUR PRESENT TO YOU
AND HER FAMILY.

719
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:48,418
WE CAN DO
THE SECOND DANCE NUMBER.

720
00:28:48,442 --> 00:28:49,711
WE'LL DO IT
AT THE ENGAGEMENT PARTY.

721
00:28:49,735 --> 00:28:51,253
DO YOU MIND IF, LIKE,

722
00:28:51,277 --> 00:28:53,502
I JUST TALK TO MY
DAD ALONE FOR--

723
00:28:53,526 --> 00:28:54,418
YEAH, NO, NO.

724
00:28:54,442 --> 00:28:55,418
WE'LL DO
THE WEDDING PLANS LATER.

725
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:59,794
YEAH. YEAH.
YEAH, WE HAVE LONG TIME.

726
00:28:59,818 --> 00:29:00,961
OKAY.

727
00:29:00,985 --> 00:29:02,295
SHE WILL MAKE
THE BEST PARTY FOR YOU.

728
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:04,045
OKAY, I NEED YOU
TO LISTEN.

729
00:29:04,069 --> 00:29:05,419
WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE
A BIG ENGAGEMENT.

730
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:06,586
YOU'RE RIGHT,
IT WON'T BE BIG.

731
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:07,711
IT'LL BE NOT SO BIG.

732
00:29:07,735 --> 00:29:08,920
WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE
AN ENGAGEMENT PARTY.

733
00:29:08,944 --> 00:29:11,170
IT WILL BE NOT BIG
BY INDIAN STANDARDS.

734
00:29:11,194 --> 00:29:13,003
WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE
AN ENGAGEMENT PARTY.

735
00:29:13,027 --> 00:29:14,418
DON'T CRY.

736
00:29:14,442 --> 00:29:16,419
MY ONLY SON AND I,
WE CAN'T HAVE...

737
00:29:16,443 --> 00:29:17,878
I CAN'T EVEN GIVE YOU,

738
00:29:17,902 --> 00:29:20,544
LIKE, A SMALL LITTLE
ENGAGEMENT CELEBRATION?

739
00:29:20,568 --> 00:29:23,086
NO, NO. NO,
JUST LEAVE SUTISH OUT!

740
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:24,836
OKAY, I'LL JUST MAYBE
GO BACK HOME, THEN, HUH?

741
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:25,836
AND YOU CAN...

742
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,418
YOU CAN CALL ME
AND TELL ME HOW IT WENT.

743
00:29:27,442 --> 00:29:28,419
I DON'T WANT
TO DO THIS RIGHT NOW.

744
00:29:28,443 --> 00:29:29,669
I DON'T WANT TO DO
THIS RIGHT NOW.

745
00:29:29,693 --> 00:29:30,794
WELL, WHEN DO YOU
WANT TO DO IT, HUH?

746
00:29:30,818 --> 00:29:31,794
IF I'M GOING TO CRY

747
00:29:31,818 --> 00:29:33,418
AND I'M GOING TO HAVE
A HEART ATTACK,

748
00:29:33,442 --> 00:29:34,419
IT MAY AS WELL BE NOW
RATHER THAN TOMORROW

749
00:29:34,443 --> 00:29:35,628
TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS.

750
00:29:35,652 --> 00:29:37,086
CAN'T EVEN HAVE
AN ENGAGEMENT PARTY!

751
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,253
FOR MY OWN--

752
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:39,586
DAD--

753
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:41,418
[NEHNA]: WE CAN USE THIS
FOR THE ENGAGEMENT PARTY!

754
00:29:41,442 --> 00:29:43,418
THERE IS
NO ENGAGEMENT PARTY!

755
00:29:43,442 --> 00:29:44,418
ALL RIGHT?
JUST SHUT UP.

756
00:29:44,442 --> 00:29:47,003
THERE IS NO--
THERE IS NO ENGAGEMENT PARTY?

757
00:29:47,027 --> 00:29:48,794
THERE IS NO
ENGAGEMENT PARTY. OKAY?

758
00:29:48,818 --> 00:29:50,418
THERE IS
NO ENGAGEMENT PARTY?

759
00:29:50,442 --> 00:29:52,544
BUT BANTI'S PLACE
WOULD BE VERY GOOD FOR IT,

760
00:29:52,568 --> 00:29:55,086
IF YOU WANT IT THERE!

761
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:58,418
I DON'T THINK "AFFECTIONATE"
IS THE RIGHT WORD, BUT, UH,

762
00:29:58,442 --> 00:30:00,419
BUT A GOOD DAD,
A GOOD SOLID DAD.

763
00:30:00,443 --> 00:30:02,836
I MEAN, EVERYTHING HAD TO BE
EARNED WITH HIM, RIGHT?

764
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,211
THERE WAS NOTHING
THAT WAS JUST GIVEN.

765
00:30:04,235 --> 00:30:05,628
HE WAS A WORKAHOLIC.

766
00:30:05,652 --> 00:30:08,442
I THINK HE WAS SUCCESSFUL
WITH US.

767
00:30:10,442 --> 00:30:11,878
YEAH.

768
00:30:11,902 --> 00:30:13,419
"OUR FATHER."

769
00:30:13,443 --> 00:30:14,878
"OUR FATHER."

770
00:30:14,902 --> 00:30:16,045
I THINK THAT'S--

771
00:30:16,069 --> 00:30:17,586
I'M SORRY, BUT I THINK
THAT'S BEEN USED.

772
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:18,711
THAT ONE'S
TAKEN, YEAH.

773
00:30:18,735 --> 00:30:19,711
YEAH, THAT'S GOOD.

774
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:20,836
NO, THAT'S ALL
I STOLE.

775
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,461
THAT'S IT.
THAT'S ALL YOU GOT.

776
00:30:22,485 --> 00:30:23,586
I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.

777
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:24,544
JUST THE BIBLE.

778
00:30:24,568 --> 00:30:25,711
YEAH, OKAY.

779
00:30:25,735 --> 00:30:26,878
WELL, HE IS
OUR FATHER, RIGHT?

780
00:30:26,902 --> 00:30:28,418
ABSOLUTELY.

781
00:30:28,442 --> 00:30:29,419
"OUR FATHER,
THE WIND,

782
00:30:29,443 --> 00:30:31,295
WHOSE VERY BREATH

783
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:32,628
BLEW WARMTH
AND RADIANT COMFORT

784
00:30:32,652 --> 00:30:34,920
AGAINST THE COLD NIGHT.

785
00:30:34,944 --> 00:30:36,628
OUR FATHER, FIRE,

786
00:30:36,652 --> 00:30:39,045
WHOSE PASSION
AND INTELLECTUAL STRENGTH

787
00:30:39,069 --> 00:30:41,836
BURNED LIKE
A ROARING FLAME.

788
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,418
OUR FATHER, WATER,

789
00:30:43,442 --> 00:30:45,878
WHO COULD FLOW
THROUGH ALL IMPEDIMENT

790
00:30:45,902 --> 00:30:48,418
AND WHO COULD,
LIKE A MIGHTY OCEAN,

791
00:30:48,442 --> 00:30:50,418
NURTURE AND SHAPE

792
00:30:50,442 --> 00:30:53,669
ALL WHO WERE BLESSED ENOUGH
TO BATHE IN HIS GLORY.

793
00:30:53,693 --> 00:30:56,418
OUR FATHER, EARTH,

794
00:30:56,442 --> 00:30:59,418
SOLID, STRONG, ETERNAL,

795
00:30:59,442 --> 00:31:05,544
WHOSE FOUNDATION AND NURTURING
BROUGHT FOUR TINY SEEDS,

796
00:31:05,568 --> 00:31:09,693
AND TURNED THEM INTO
THE FOUR MEN WE ARE TODAY."

797
00:31:11,442 --> 00:31:12,419
I LIKE THAT,
MARLOWE.

798
00:31:12,443 --> 00:31:14,045
THAT WAS NICE, MAN.

799
00:31:14,069 --> 00:31:14,961
THANKS.

800
00:31:14,985 --> 00:31:16,461
YEAH, HERE.
HERE'S TO DAD.

801
00:31:16,485 --> 00:31:18,442
TO OUR FATHER.

802
00:31:26,152 --> 00:31:27,794
HEY, I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT YOU GUYS.

803
00:31:27,818 --> 00:31:29,295
I THOUGHT MAYBE, UH,

804
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:32,878
WE COULD, MAYBE EACH, UH,
YOU KNOW...

805
00:31:32,902 --> 00:31:34,628
TELL A STORY ABOUT DAD,
SHARE A LITTLE.

806
00:31:34,652 --> 00:31:36,211
I'M INTO IT!
I'M TOTALLY INTO IT.

807
00:31:36,235 --> 00:31:37,211
I WAS KIND OF HOPING

808
00:31:37,235 --> 00:31:38,418
THAT WE'D DO SOMETHING
LIKE THAT, ACTUALLY.

809
00:31:38,442 --> 00:31:41,337
YOU WANT QUINTESSENTIAL DAD?
YOU WANT DAD AS I KNOW HIM?

810
00:31:41,361 --> 00:31:42,418
OF COURSE, YEAH.

811
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:44,211
IS THAT IT? OKAY.

812
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:48,378
SO THIS WAS, UM, RIGHT AFTER
I, UH, QUIT PARSONS.

813
00:31:48,402 --> 00:31:49,669
WELL, YOU DIDN'T
QUIT PARSONS.

814
00:31:49,693 --> 00:31:51,836
I MEAN, JUST
FACTUALLY SPEAKING. NO.

815
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:54,378
YEAH, I QUIT
PARSONS. I QUIT.

816
00:31:54,402 --> 00:31:55,753
OKAY, YOU LEFT PARSONS.

817
00:31:55,777 --> 00:31:57,045
WE HAD A PARTING
OF THE WAYS.

818
00:31:57,069 --> 00:31:58,586
YES, YOU DID.

819
00:31:58,610 --> 00:31:59,544
I LET THEM KNOW HOW I FELT

820
00:31:59,568 --> 00:32:00,794
ABOUT THE LEVEL
OF THEIR INSTRUCTION

821
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:02,461
AND ACTED ACCORDINGLY.

822
00:32:02,485 --> 00:32:04,003
THEY LET ME KNOW
HOW THEY FELT

823
00:32:04,027 --> 00:32:05,295
ABOUT MY OUTSPOKENNESS,

824
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:06,418
AND WE HAD
A MUTUAL AGREEMENT

825
00:32:06,442 --> 00:32:08,628
THAT IT WAS NOT
THE RIGHT FIT FOR US.

826
00:32:08,652 --> 00:32:09,836
SURE, IF THAT'S HOW
YOU WANT TO PHRASE IT.

827
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,253
THAT'S GOOD.

828
00:32:11,277 --> 00:32:13,419
ANYWAY,
I HAD LEFT PARSONS,

829
00:32:13,443 --> 00:32:16,419
AND I WAS HERE,
STAYING WITH THE OLD MAN,

830
00:32:16,443 --> 00:32:18,378
AND, UH, I HAD NOTHING.

831
00:32:18,402 --> 00:32:20,253
I WAS TOTALLY TAPPED, RIGHT?

832
00:32:20,277 --> 00:32:21,878
HE GIVES ME A LITTLE BIT HERE,
A LITTLE BIT THERE,

833
00:32:21,902 --> 00:32:23,418
AND I'M GETTING DOWNTOWN
AND WHATEVER,

834
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:25,794
AND THEN,
THEN HE CUTS ME OFF, THAT'S IT.

835
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:27,170
SO I'M STUCK.

836
00:32:27,194 --> 00:32:28,253
SO...

837
00:32:28,277 --> 00:32:30,045
I HAD THAT GUITAR, RIGHT?

838
00:32:30,069 --> 00:32:31,878
YOU REMEMBER THAT '61,
THE RED '61 JAGUAR?

839
00:32:31,902 --> 00:32:33,086
THAT WAS A NICE GUITAR.

840
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,253
BEAUTIFUL GUITAR.

841
00:32:34,277 --> 00:32:35,586
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO FIND
ONE OF THOSE.

842
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:38,295
SO I SAID, "FINE,
I'LL SELL THE FUCKING GUITAR.

843
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:40,418
I'LL SHOW HIM,
I'LL USE MY ASSETS."

844
00:32:40,442 --> 00:32:42,920
SO I WENT DOWNTOWN,
WENT TO A PAWNSHOP ON HASTINGS.

845
00:32:42,944 --> 00:32:44,419
TOLD THEM I WANTED 900 BUCKS
FOR IT.

846
00:32:44,443 --> 00:32:45,961
THEY SAID, "NAW,
YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET THAT."

847
00:32:45,985 --> 00:32:47,418
I SAID, "I'M GETTING 900 BUCKS
FOR THIS.

848
00:32:47,442 --> 00:32:48,961
PUT IT IN THE FUCKING WINDOW
FOR 900."

849
00:32:48,985 --> 00:32:51,253
I SOLD IT IN A DAY.

850
00:32:51,277 --> 00:32:53,628
I GO DOWN TO PICK UP THE MONEY,
I COME BACK WITH 900 BUCKS.

851
00:32:53,652 --> 00:32:56,211
I WALK IN,
THE WAD IN MY HAND, I SAY,

852
00:32:56,235 --> 00:32:57,253
"DAD, LOOK AT THIS,

853
00:32:57,277 --> 00:32:59,418
"I WENT AND SOLD MY GUITAR.
I GOT 900 BUCKS.

854
00:32:59,442 --> 00:33:01,128
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GIVE ME
ANYTHING, I'M SET."

855
00:33:01,152 --> 00:33:02,753
YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAYS TO ME?

856
00:33:02,777 --> 00:33:06,003
HE SAYS, "MY LAST COUNT,
YOU OWE ME 750.

857
00:33:06,027 --> 00:33:09,419
YOU'RE INTO ME FOR 750."

858
00:33:09,443 --> 00:33:12,920
HE TAKES 750 BUCKS
OUT OF MY HAND.

859
00:33:12,944 --> 00:33:15,544
MY GUITAR IS GONE.

860
00:33:15,568 --> 00:33:17,211
I SAID, "DAD, CAN'T WE JUST
LET IT RIDE?

861
00:33:17,235 --> 00:33:18,794
I JUST SOLD
THE ONE THING I HAVE,

862
00:33:18,818 --> 00:33:20,419
THE ONE THING THAT--

863
00:33:20,443 --> 00:33:22,794
THAT I HAVE
THAT MEANS ANYTHING TO ME,

864
00:33:22,818 --> 00:33:24,628
JUST SO I CAN
GET A FLOAT GOING

865
00:33:24,652 --> 00:33:26,128
TILL I GET SET UP."

866
00:33:26,152 --> 00:33:28,045
HE SAID, "NO, IF YOU'VE LEARNED
ONE THING IN THIS HOUSE, HENRY,

867
00:33:28,069 --> 00:33:30,418
IT'S YOU HANDLE
YOUR DEBTS FIRST, RIGHT?

868
00:33:30,442 --> 00:33:32,669
THAT'S THE WAY IT GOES."
AND, SO--

869
00:33:32,693 --> 00:33:36,836
SO, THERE I WAS.
150 BUCKS, NO GUITAR.

870
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,045
WOW.

871
00:33:38,069 --> 00:33:40,418
AND LESSON LEARNED, YEAH?

872
00:33:40,442 --> 00:33:41,337
FUCK YOU!

873
00:33:41,361 --> 00:33:42,920
LESSON
FUCKIN' LEARNED?

874
00:33:42,944 --> 00:33:44,253
I'LL GIVE YOU
A FUCKIN' LESSON LEARNED.

875
00:33:44,277 --> 00:33:45,461
LET'S GET DOWN TO THIS,
ALL RIGHT?

876
00:33:45,485 --> 00:33:47,418
THAT FUCKER
WAS ABOUT THE BOTTOM LINE,

877
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:48,586
WELL, LET'S TALK ABOUT
THE BOTTOM LINE.

878
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:49,586
WHY ARE WE SITTING HERE

879
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:51,086
FUCKING EULOGIZING
THAT PIECE OF SHIT?

880
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:53,128
LET'S FIND OUT
WHAT THE FUCK THE DEAL IS HERE.

881
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:54,253
WHOA, WHOA.

882
00:33:54,277 --> 00:33:55,920
YEAH, I'VE HAD IT
WITH YOUR FUCKING PLATITUDES.

WE'RE ALL CURIOUS, RIGHT?

898
00:34:19,902 --> 00:34:21,794
I'M HAPPY TO DO IT
WHEN THERE'S A CONSENSUS

THAT IT'S TIME TO DO IT.

TO BE YOUR DAD,

00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:44,418
AND EVERY TIME I SEE HIM,
I GO HOME FOR CHRISTMAS,

1054
00:39:44,442 --> 00:39:48,878
AND I, IT'S TOO MUCH,
AND I CAN'T...

1055
00:39:48,902 --> 00:39:51,170
I CAN'T GET PAST
THESE THINGS.

1056
00:39:51,194 --> 00:39:54,878
I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE
OF WHAT WE DO IN MY CULTURE.

1057
00:39:54,902 --> 00:39:56,544
I, THE FATHER OF THE GROOM,

1058
00:39:56,568 --> 00:39:59,418
WOULD PUT ON A HUGE, BIG,
BRIGHT, COLOURFUL HINDU PARTY

1059
00:39:59,442 --> 00:40:01,418

AND THEIR FAMILY.

1060
00:40:01,442 --> 00:40:04,211
IT'S SO MUCH FUN!
YOU HAVE NO IDEA, BUT, UM--

1061
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,128
WELL?

1062
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:06,003
THAT'S NOT REALLY
WHAT WE WANTED, DAD.

1063
00:40:06,027 --> 00:40:07,003
I TOLD YOU THIS.

1064
00:40:07,027 --> 00:40:08,337
WELL, IT'S NOT WHAT
WE DISCUSSED, BUT...

1065
00:40:08,361 --> 00:40:10,003

THAT IDEA CAME TO ME,

1066
00:40:10,027 --> 00:40:11,295
WHICH WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO,
I KNOW,

1067
00:40:11,319 --> 00:40:12,502

1071
00:40:17,442 --> 00:40:20,211

"LET'S DO A BIG PARTY FOR THEM."

1072
00:40:20,235 --> 00:40:21,836

BE PERFORMING

1073
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:24,418

IT WOULD BE, YEAH,

1081
00:40:33,152 --> 00:40:35,277
BUT IT'S NOT
GOING TO HAPPEN, SO...

1082
00:40:36,652 --> 00:40:39,170
YOU KNOW, I SUPPOSE
THE ROLE OF A FATHER,

1083
00:40:39,194 --> 00:40:40,418
FOR MOST JEWS,

1084
00:40:40,442 --> 00:40:42,418

UH, INSTILL A SENSE OF,
UM, FEAR

1086
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:49,378
AND SHAME.

1087
00:40:49,402 --> 00:40:53,194
THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE
WITHOUT HAVE SONS AND DAUGHTERS,

1088
00:40:54,693 --> 00:40:57,860
MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE HAD,
LIKE, A DOG?

1089
00:40:59,069 --> 00:41:02,418
YOUR MOTHER DIDN'T WANT
A MAN IN HER LIFE.

1090
00:41:02,442 --> 00:41:06,628
SHE JUST WANTED
TO PLAY THE PIANO.

1091
00:41:06,652 --> 00:41:08,669
UH, A BABY?

1092
00:41:08,693 --> 00:41:10,628
I, I DON'T KNOW
IF SHE WANTED A BABY,

1093
00:41:10,652 --> 00:41:13,086
BUT I KNOW
SHE DIDN'T WANT AN ABORTION.

1094
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:15,086
SHE DIDN'T LIKE NEEDLES.

1095
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:17,669
BUT, BERNIE,
SHE ADORED YOU.

1096
00:41:17,693 --> 00:41:20,418
SHE LOVED YOU VERY MUCH.

1097
00:41:20,442 --> 00:41:22,295
LOOK AT WHO YOU
TURNED OUT TO BE.

1098
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:25,277
YOU'RE A GOOD MAN.

1099
00:41:29,693 --> 00:41:32,086
SHE MADE ME
PROMISE, BERNIE.

1100
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:33,669
SHE MADE ME PROMISE
ON THE BIBLE

1101
00:41:33,693 --> 00:41:35,253
AND ON THE GRAVE
OF OUR MOTHER

1102
00:41:35,277 --> 00:41:38,418
THAT I WOULD NEVER TELL YOU
ABOUT YOUR FATHER,

1103
00:41:38,442 --> 00:41:40,418
BUT THEN, WHEN IT...

1104
00:41:40,442 --> 00:41:43,418
BECAME CLEAR WE WERE
GOING TO LOSE HER,

1105
00:41:43,442 --> 00:41:46,086
I THOUGHT,

1106
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:48,128
I CAN'T STAND

1107
00:41:48,152 --> 00:41:49,461

ALL ALONE

1109
00:41:51,027 --> 00:41:54,418
AND THAT YOU WOULDN'T
KNOW YOU HAD A FATHER.

1110
00:41:54,442 --> 00:41:56,628
SO I...

1111
00:41:56,652 --> 00:41:57,878
I FOUND HIM,

1112
00:41:57,902 --> 00:42:00,502

TO THE FUNERAL.

ABOUT YOU EITHER.

HAPPEN LIKE THAT.
