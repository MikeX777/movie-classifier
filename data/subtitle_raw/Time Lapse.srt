to change the future.

163
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,329
But under these circumstances, it
seems to be a risk worth taking.

164
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,482
If I believed in God,

165
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:21,201
I would pray today that no greater harm
will come from what I'm about to do.”

166
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,606
Then what?

167
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,968
Nothing. That's the last
entry, a week ago today.

168
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,042
A week ago.

169
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:36,444
Seven photos. That means it was
kicking it out after he disappeared.

170
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,329
So it must be on a timer.

171
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,324
8200 PM.

172
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,641
Then why are there
so many daytime ones?

173
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,769
Maybe it's only been taking ones
at night for the last week.

174
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,005
All right.

175
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,050

is a little fucking unsettling.

00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,484
It looked like he was burned.

Yeah, I don't know about that.

00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,291

It wasn't even touched.

Isn't it obvious? I mean,
you read his journal.

191
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,249
He broke the cardinal rule.

please take his hat off.

198
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,482
I mean, we just discovered
a fucking time-traveling camera!

199
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,289
We need to consider
the possibilities.

200
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,604
Well, one possibility is we've all been
dosed with lethal amounts of radiation...

201
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,286
that, you know,
could've killed Mr.

00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:51,207
Okay, Negative Nancy, but what
if we could use this thing?

203
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,811
How?

204
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,884
Remember how Mr. “B” took a photo
of himself holding that sign?

205
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:03,291
What if we put up, like,
the newspaper?

206
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,169
We would know what happens
in the future.

207
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,132
Yeah, the newspaper, Jasper?
What are you thinking?

209
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,970
- Or are you thinking the race results?
- Oh.

210

Well, what if?

211
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,724
Think about how much money
we could make.

And instead, you can
pursue writing full time.

No! Absolutely not!
We're calling the police.

of your life in pathetic obscurity...

217
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,889
and die penniless and insane.

218
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,369
- I'm serious, Jasper.
- So am I.

219
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,124
Does it look like
the cops are here?

220
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,602
That people are buzzing about the
charred corpse in the storage unit?

221
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,170
Everything looks fine.

222
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,164
If we reported it, we probably
wouldn't have had the party anyway.

223
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,685
We'd have canceled it
altogether.

224
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,805
Uh, we can't cancel it. It's Dave
and Sharon's engagement party.

225
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,723
That's what I'm saying.

226
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,484
Obviously,
we don't report it tonight.

227
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,690
There is a dead fucking st-rotting
corpse in the storage unit.

228

as we keep the door closed.

not go through with it.

If I understand this correctly,
this is how it works.

278
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,921
The camera spits out a
photo of us in the future.

279
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:57,489
Then we go about our day making a series of
decisions that lead up until that moment.

280
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:01,690
But if we deviate
from those decisions,

281
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,001
then this photo never happened.

282
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,961
Which means “us,” the people who saw
the original photo, can't go forward.

283
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,486
Because our futures
don't exist anymore.

Um, what do you mean
“can't go forward”?

285
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,809
I mean, are we 100% sure
that's how he died?

286
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,329
No, but do you really want
to test it and find out?

00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,691

- Next?

get out of the country,

get away from the machine.

A Dr. Heidecker
is here.

863
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:39,291
She's looking
for Mr. Bezzerides.

864
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:42,364
Did you tell her that he moved
out a couple months ago?

865
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:50,246
Did he give you his hat
before he left?

866

<i><font color="#808080">FINN:</font> So we, uh-
we found his journal,</i>

867
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:02,121
and from what we've read,
I guess he saw something bad.

868
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:06,404
I know. He sent me a letter.
He tried to change it.

869
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:09,683
After Henry retired, he kept
me up on his experiments.

870
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:12,923
To be honest, I didn't think
they'd amount to much.

871
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:17,487
- Poor Henry.
- <font color="#808080">JASPER:</font> Yep.

Don't fuck with time.

873
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:25,161
Well-
You think time did this?

874
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:28,210
That he was somehow punished
for trying to change the future?

875
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:32,046
Well, what else would
do that to someone?

876
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:34,521
Thorium gas
would be my first guess.

877
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:36,602
You see the coil over there?

878
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:39,331
I'm guessing he was stretching
for it up on that shelf there...

879
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:43,041
when he knocked over
the canister.

880
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:46,442
It's just an accident, his death.
That's all. Nothing more.

881
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:50,804
I suspect he was panicked...

882
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:52,803
whilst in the process of, uh,

883
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:56,805
trying to avoid this.

884
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:04,362
You see his hat on the couch and what
looks like his blood on the window?

885
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:06,568
It seems that he met
an unpleasant end,

886
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:10,964
but clearly this photograph,
which takes place tomorrow,

887
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:14,122
had nothing to do
with him at all.

888
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:16,168
Oh, it's ironic.

889
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:18,402
Tomorrow?

890
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:22,690
How could he have taken the photo when the
camera only shoots one day ahead of time?

891
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:25,081
Why, I don't know where
you're getting your data,

892
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:27,083
but I believe you're mistaken.

893
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:29,049
This letter's postmarked
a week ago,

894
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:32,203
so he had to have taken the photo
at least that far in advance.

895
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:34,721
A week? How could he have
mailed the photo? Hang on.

896
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:37,610
You're telling me you can shoot
a photo whenever you want?

897
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:40,843
No. I don't know about
“whenever you want.”

898
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:44,691
Evidently, Henry had moved
past the initial tests...

899
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:46,762
and had got it to look further.

900
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:49,684

change the settings?

me, but not his methods.

right in front of him.

1133

<i>You kept picking the machine
and your work over us.</i>

1134
01:36:18,120 --> 01:36:20,885
So I had to do something to
bring you back to your senses.

1135

you fought for us...

If you destroy the machine,
I can't fix this.

We won't remember
any of this tomorrow.

What are you doing here, Joe?

1158
01:38:52,120 --> 01:38:54,202
I got a message from Finn.

1159
01:38:54,280 --> 01:38:57,124
He said that you two
were leaving town.

1160
01:38:57,200 --> 01:39:00,647
I might be interested to see
what Jasper was up to.

Sure. Fine.

It doesn't matter.

Tonight none of this
will matter.

1167
01:39:35,480 --> 01:39:38,689
I guess you might have
some questions for me?
