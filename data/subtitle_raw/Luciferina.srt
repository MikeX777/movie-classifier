1
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:16,280
Hi, Natalia.

2
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:21,577
Hi, Lucas. Did you come back?

3
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:27,208
I'm back because I missed you,
are you leaving now?

4
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,628
I'm not going anywhere.

5
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,239
Why are you looking at me like that?

6
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:46,810
- I don't have the glow anymore, right?
- Calm down, Lucas.

7
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:54,360
Tell me! I don't, do I?

8
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:09,792
Here, it'll look after
you until you return.

9
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:19,093
Bye, Natalia.

10
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,606
Mother superior is looking for you.

11
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:56,630
I was informed your
parents had an accident.

12
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:02,094
They've been looking for you for two days.

13
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,680
An accident?

14
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:14,356
Your mother died.

15
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:18,902
They didn't give any more details.

16
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:22,906
I'm very sorry.

17
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,078
You can leave when you feel ready.

18
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,835
I don't want to leave here, mother.

19
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:41,383
Natalia, this place is not a hideout.

20
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:45,596
We will pray for all of you!

21
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:40,562
Ángela?

22
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:59,623
- Where is Ángela?
- I'm Mauro, her boyfriend.

23
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:02,084
Where is she?

24
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:06,129
Went to deal with the old
lady's ashes at the funeral home.

25
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:15,764
- And my dad?
- Upstairs, in the attic.

26
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:20,561
Your sister asked me to come back
tomorrow, and every day from them on.

27
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:28,402
Please let me know if you
make any modifications.

28
00:09:28,694 --> 00:09:32,364
He's resting now.
I'm very sorry for your mother.

29
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:41,206
You're the little nun, aren't you?

30
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,107
Dad...

31
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:02,579
She cut her wrists and
painted all that shit.

32
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:05,707
He tried to stop her,
but she attacked him.

33
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:07,584
Ángela.

34
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:32,442
Who's that woman?

35
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:34,945
Who knows.

36
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:42,077
Is that blood?

37
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:46,581
I don't know, I was at the university.

38
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:49,793
Why don't you ask him, the family doctor?

39
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:51,461
Maybe he will answer to you.

40
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:54,131
He went into shock and
doesn't want to talk.

41
00:11:57,718 --> 00:11:59,594
I'm not coming back to this room.

42
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,477
Wake up, Natalia! Mom didn't
sleep with him anymore.

43
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:09,604
She was living in the attic!

44
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,315
And now he doesn't want to come out.

45
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:15,527
All the better, I don't want to see him.

46
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:19,156
The nurse comes twice a day to clean
his ass, unless you want to do it...

47
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:21,324
- How can you talk like this?
- Let go of me!

48
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:23,577
Don't come to criticize me now, OK?

49
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:26,413
You disappeared for two years.

50
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:29,875
You went away, and didn't
leave a note or even call.

51
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:32,836
I have nothing to do with
this house, and you know it.

52
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:35,297
I could never stand being
here, it makes me sick.

53
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:37,567
And I left because I have a vocation...

54
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:40,761
Bullshit! I believed you at first,
but then I realized everything.

55
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:43,513
You got away...

56
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:46,516
and left me here alone,
stuck with those two.

57
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:48,310
What are you talking about?

58
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,855
You saw something too.

59
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:55,859
Mom tried to tell me,
but she couldn't speak.

60
00:12:56,193 --> 00:12:58,904
In less than two months,
she was completely lost.

61
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:03,116
- That thing wasn't Alzheimer's.
- What thing?

62
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:06,411
She looked possessed.

63
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:11,082
She locked herself up in that room,
and screamed she was being worked on.

64
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:12,706
Black magic, witchcraft...

65
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:16,213
Ángela, you're delusional!
It's this stuff you take, look at yourself!

66
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:17,798
OK, you're right,

67
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,800
stay with your vocation here,
I'm leaving.

68
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:21,927
Where are you going?

69
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:30,310
Like dad used to say.
The best kind of charity starts at home.

70
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:09,784
I swear it, the guy was a freak.
He fucked every living creature.

71
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:15,332
He has a tremendous energy.
It's unbelievable!

72
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:21,004
Anyway, I think if you
have a lot of shit in you,

73
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:24,215
and you're a real son of a bitch,
everything will come back to you.

74
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:26,267
That German guy was found
dead in the jungle.

75
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:28,136
No, he wasn't German, Mara.

76
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,805
No, he was Swedish. He was Swedish!

77
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:35,518
The guy was called Jacek Slawec.
It's true, the news said:

78
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:39,856
"Foreigner goes into coma in Iquitos
due to Peruvian drug."

79
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:43,818
- Well, this one was in La Paz.
- In La Paz?

80
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:47,530
Yes, he wanted the demon inside
of him to be expelled,

81
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:50,867
and jumped from the bell tower
of a church in San Francisco. Naked.

82
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:54,287
- Like a poet.
- Naked!

83
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:59,918
- Hey, you want some?
- No, thank you.

84
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:04,130
Sure? Come here, sit with us.

85
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:07,175
- We don't bite.
- Mauro, leave her alone.

86
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:10,845
Is it true you're a virgin?

87
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:27,654
Yes, I am a virgin.

88
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:34,703
What, you're like saving
all of that for God?

89
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:37,372
What is your problem?
They're my beliefs.

90
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:42,335
Well, did you know older virgin
women are at risk of getting cancer?

91
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:43,837
- Really?
- Yes.

92
00:16:45,714 --> 00:16:50,468
No, it's a lie! But I had to say it.

93
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,804
Your beliefs are a bit medieval.

94
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:54,973
Perhaps we should look at the real reason.

95
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:57,225
Everybody hides something.

96
00:16:57,517 --> 00:17:01,021
- I have nothing to hide.
- Oh, confidence as a shield.

97
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:04,149
I think you are hiding something...

98
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:07,569
That you would love to have some of this.

99
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:09,487
Leave her alone, dude!

100
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:11,156
Don't touch her!

101
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:12,699
What do you think you're doing?

102
00:17:12,991 --> 00:17:14,743
Are you crazy?
Are you out of your mind?

103
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:16,578
Calm down, Mauro!

104
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:19,039
Guys! No, guys, no!

105
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:20,915
Sick bastard!

106
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:23,251
- Please, stop.
- I'll beat your ass.

107
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,588
Stop it, stop it, calm down, man!

108
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,923
Dude, we're just having a conversation!

109
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:30,258
Ángela.

110
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:42,604
What is it? Did the freak
get all horny with the nun,

111
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:44,064
and want to give her some?

112
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,652
Fuck you. I was leaving anyway.

113
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:53,782
Are you OK?

114
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:57,202
I told you it wasn't a good idea
to bring this asshole.

115
00:17:58,203 --> 00:17:59,954
Well, tell that to Ángela.

116
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,373
She thinks the rite can help him.

117
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:05,835
First we need to know what she needs.

118
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:09,923
He only comes for the effect of the drug.

119
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:16,408
- Let me see.
- No, it's fine, thanks.

120
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:20,600
If you leave it like that,
it will keep bleeding.

121
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:23,561
Please?

122
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:45,708
The Immaculate Natalia.
The Virgin Natalia.

123
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:09,065
Dad is hiding something from us,
that's why he wouldn't talk.

124
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,027
Where are you going, Ángela?

125
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:22,787
When you left, I got pregnant.

126
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:26,583
I was dating someone,
I didn't see him again.

127
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,543
That asshole thought he was the father.

128
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,170
And who was it?

129
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:34,381
I don't know.

130
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:40,638
I didn't use protection.

131
00:19:42,557 --> 00:19:44,976
I didn't realize until three months later.

132
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:55,737
I went to the house of a nurse.
Do you know how they do it?

133
00:19:58,656 --> 00:19:59,656
It was awful.

134
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:06,122
A needle went through my uterus,
and I almost die of internal bleeding.

135
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:09,626
Why didn't you tell dad?

136
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:16,966
After my abortion, mom
started to get worse and worse.

137
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:22,305
She locked herself up in the attic,
and started drawing those uteri.

138
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:26,434
She didn't want him in there.

139
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:30,605
He killed her, he did it
so you would come back.

140
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:34,734
What? You're crazy, Ángela.

141
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:37,487
I know they're not our parents.

142
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:39,656
I need to know who I am,

143
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:43,076
and why the fuck were we stuck
in that house all these years.

144
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:56,589
We're going to do a rite
with a sacred plant in Tigre.

145
00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:00,969
It's going to show us what
they've been hiding from us.

146
00:21:05,348 --> 00:21:07,183
I need you to come with me, please.

147
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:09,675
No, Ángela! I'm not following
you on this crazy journey.

148
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:13,815
- You need to know the truth too.
- The truth is you're avoiding the problem.

149
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,819
We're leaving tomorrow morning.

150
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:52,759
Papa?

151
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:12,964
Natalia...

152
00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:12,400
Shh, calm down.

153
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:18,906
What are you telling your sister, huh?

154
00:28:19,657 --> 00:28:22,618
What do you want?
Do you want her to be castrated like you?

155
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:23,910
Yeah?

156
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:31,168
Or are you jealous of her?

157
00:28:31,711 --> 00:28:34,338
Do you want some of this?

158
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:38,467
You know what I think?

159
00:28:39,093 --> 00:28:41,011
I think you're no saint.

160
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:48,018
Let see how right I am.

161
00:28:58,112 --> 00:28:59,947
Listen carefully.

162
00:29:01,157 --> 00:29:05,035
If Ángela leaves me,
I swear I will kill her, understand?

163
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:10,082
It's our secret. OK, I'm leaving.

164
00:29:32,813 --> 00:29:33,813
Dad?

165
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:38,486
Dad, can you hear me?

166
00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:48,287
Dad, I have to go.

167
00:29:49,747 --> 00:29:51,332
You'll be fine.

168
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:54,418
I need to look after Ángela.

169
00:29:57,004 --> 00:29:58,214
I'll be back in a few days.

170
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:19,485
Wait!

171
00:30:20,945 --> 00:30:22,571
Look who's coming with us.

172
00:30:39,463 --> 00:30:40,840
See you there.

173
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:51,976
Nati? I mean, can I call you Nati?

174
00:30:52,935 --> 00:30:55,062
Your sister is brilliant at University.

175
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:57,940
Best sophomore student in Psychology.

176
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:01,944
Yes, until she started dating that moron.

177
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:05,447
Why do we have to go so far away?

178
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,619
It's a rite, Abel. It has to be done
far from the negative energy of the city.

179
00:31:14,957 --> 00:31:19,837
It's OK. We've already done it,
it's nothing.

180
00:31:20,671 --> 00:31:22,548
Besides, he's no ordinary shaman.

181
00:31:23,007 --> 00:31:25,301
And the place is wonderful.

182
00:31:25,676 --> 00:31:28,888
We met him with Mara about a year ago,
when we were doing our final project.

183
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:31,557
It's a Peruvian man that cures
with a psychotropic liquid,

184
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:33,517
made from plants of the Amazon.

185
00:31:34,018 --> 00:31:37,563
The ayahuasca creeper,
I don't know if you've heard of it...

186
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:42,151
Well, that along with the Chacruna bush,

187
00:31:42,443 --> 00:31:44,403
which is the stuff that
contains the hallucinogen.

188
00:31:45,571 --> 00:31:47,323
But it's a medicine...

189
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:54,538
Well... I don't know.
The shaman says

190
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,457
it cures the diseases of the soul.

191
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:59,418
I'm agnostic, no offense, but...

192
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:02,005
I think it's like a journey
to your subconscious.

193
00:32:02,046 --> 00:32:03,964
To what's suppressed in your memories.

194
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:05,925
Drugs are an escape.

195
00:32:06,216 --> 00:32:09,219
I didn't see any of the kids
in the meal center doing OK.

196
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,555
But this is no ordinary drug.

197
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:15,935
"Ayahuasca" means "rope of the dead".

198
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:21,398
For the indigenous people it is
the rope that allows the spirit

199
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:23,692
to come out of the body without dying.

200
00:32:29,907 --> 00:32:31,659
Did you ever do drugs?

201
00:32:34,161 --> 00:32:38,165
- You know. Alcohol, cigarettes, coffee
- Where is the spirit if the rope gets cut?

202
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:40,918
Why would it get cut, Abel?

203
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:43,921
I don't know, if somebody dies,

204
00:32:44,213 --> 00:32:47,675
if the body is killed during
the journey, during the rite.

205
00:32:53,764 --> 00:32:56,892
Why are you looking at me like that?
I'm not the only one who's fucked up.

206
00:32:57,184 --> 00:33:01,397
Want me to talk about the hospital,
Osvaldo? What about you, "long-sleeved"?

207
00:33:01,981 --> 00:33:03,816
The shaman will take care of that.

208
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:36,033
Look, look! Incredible!

209
00:34:36,325 --> 00:34:38,344
This belong to some nuns
from early nineteenth century,

210
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:39,448
and this is only the entry.

211
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:41,538
The abbey is in the center of the island.

212
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:46,877
In the 70s they were evicted
and a mental asylum was placed here

213
00:34:47,169 --> 00:34:50,506
But the nuns hold on and from
that shrine, they reported abuse

214
00:34:50,798 --> 00:34:52,508
among patients and abortions.

215
00:34:53,383 --> 00:34:55,094
Then everything was deserted.

216
00:34:58,722 --> 00:35:01,642
- Did you call him?
- He doesn't answer.

217
00:35:08,148 --> 00:35:10,192
That's odd. They should be here already.

218
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:18,367
So? What do we do?

219
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:23,330
I don't know. Let's wait a bit.

220
00:35:25,082 --> 00:35:27,209
Let's go to that bench over there.

221
00:35:28,544 --> 00:35:29,545
Let's go, Nati.

222
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:07,791
Be careful and don't get lost.

223
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:11,128
- Did you call him?
- He doesn't answer.

224
00:37:48,058 --> 00:37:51,478
Hi, are you in charge of this place?

225
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,069
Did you see some kids earlier?

226
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:07,786
I dreamt about this place.

227
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:14,209
It is not a good moon for
what you are going to do up there.

228
00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:19,298
One of you is lying.

229
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:16,897
Hello?

230
00:40:02,692 --> 00:40:04,027
The Lady of the Unborn.

231
00:40:07,197 --> 00:40:10,450
Sorry. My dad is a deacon
and my brother is a priest.

232
00:40:10,826 --> 00:40:13,620
Too much religion in my family.
I'm allergic.

233
00:40:14,121 --> 00:40:16,623
This is the only place I'm at peace.

234
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,546
We weren't instilled anything.

235
00:40:24,131 --> 00:40:28,009
Despite my vocation,
I'm not even baptized.

236
00:40:28,802 --> 00:40:31,430
That must be the best
way to get into religion.

237
00:40:45,735 --> 00:40:46,820
Why are you with them?

238
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:50,407
You don't study Psychology.

239
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:53,118
I used to, but I dropped out.

240
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:57,956
I, uh...

241
00:41:00,167 --> 00:41:02,586
For completely different reasons to yours,

242
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:05,797
I'm also a virgin.

243
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:08,049
But it's not something
I've decided, it's...

244
00:41:10,552 --> 00:41:15,390
I was born with a cerebral paralysis
that destroyed my nervous system.

245
00:41:15,765 --> 00:41:17,893
It's a rare disease, like epilepsy.

246
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:23,106
And since I can recall, I've been locked up
in my house or under treatments...

247
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:26,943
And I'm getting worse.

248
00:41:28,236 --> 00:41:29,279
I'm so sorry.

249
00:41:30,614 --> 00:41:33,450
Osvaldo says this plant can help me, I...

250
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:41,416
I don't think it can...

251
00:41:55,931 --> 00:41:59,142
Well, I was born with something too.

252
00:42:05,315 --> 00:42:08,026
Sometimes I can see a light behind people.

253
00:42:08,902 --> 00:42:11,821
It's something that leaves
me blind for a few minutes.

254
00:42:14,574 --> 00:42:16,034
I never told this to anyone.

255
00:42:17,202 --> 00:42:18,870
A light? Like a glow?

256
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:24,876
Like that.

257
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:30,966
But sometimes they're not shiny.

258
00:42:33,385 --> 00:42:36,972
They can be black... Dark...

259
00:42:50,193 --> 00:42:51,778
There you are!

260
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:55,198
We need to leave, it's getting late.

261
00:43:02,539 --> 00:43:03,779
I'm telling you! I saw a woman.

262
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:07,210
- How do you explain that?
- No, impossible, Nati.

263
00:43:07,502 --> 00:43:09,546
Those nuns went away 20 years ago.

264
00:43:09,838 --> 00:43:11,548
Can't you see it's all abandoned?

265
00:43:16,636 --> 00:43:18,138
How do we know they're here?

266
00:43:18,805 --> 00:43:20,265
What if they never left the coast?

267
00:43:20,557 --> 00:43:21,975
I don't have a signal! See?

268
00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:25,604
Why didn't you tell me that before?
I need to call home!

269
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:35,989
Come on, go.

270
00:43:39,826 --> 00:43:41,161
We're getting there.

271
00:43:45,498 --> 00:43:46,541
You see?

272
00:43:47,667 --> 00:43:50,462
- Let me go, get off me!
- You won't let me in?

273
00:43:50,754 --> 00:43:51,963
I don't give a fuck!

274
00:43:52,255 --> 00:43:53,255
Ángela!

275
00:43:53,506 --> 00:43:54,841
Wait, Nati, Nati, Nati!

276
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:56,842
Wait, Natalia!

277
00:43:58,470 --> 00:43:59,470
Ángela!

278
00:44:01,264 --> 00:44:02,264
What happened?

279
00:44:02,307 --> 00:44:04,851
He's angry and the shaman says
he can't drink.

280
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:06,895
- Let go of me!
- What are you doing?

281
00:44:07,187 --> 00:44:08,867
- I'm going in, Mauro.
- You're doing shit.

282
00:44:08,938 --> 00:44:10,618
- You're coming with me.
- Leave her alone!

283
00:44:10,649 --> 00:44:12,525
- Fuck off, bitch!
- No, Mauro. Calm down.

284
00:44:13,276 --> 00:44:15,236
- You want me to calm down?
- No, hey!

285
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:17,197
What are you doing?

286
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:20,367
- Put that down, Mauro.
- What the fuck are you doing?

287
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:23,286
- Calm down, calm down!
- Shut up, you punk!

288
00:44:24,037 --> 00:44:25,997
Put that down!
What's wrong with you?

289
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:31,336
You touch her again,
I swear I'll kill you, Mauro!

290
00:44:39,803 --> 00:44:41,721
Dead. Dead.

291
00:44:42,722 --> 00:44:43,723
It's ok now.

292
00:44:44,307 --> 00:44:45,350
Dead.

293
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:48,310
Dead.

294
00:44:50,313 --> 00:44:52,565
Easy, Mara.
Look at me. It's ok now.

295
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:54,025
You little fuck.

296
00:45:00,115 --> 00:45:00,740
You OK?

297
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:02,701
It's alright.

298
00:45:07,247 --> 00:45:08,247
You OK?

299
00:45:09,332 --> 00:45:10,332
Yeah.

300
00:45:12,752 --> 00:45:14,379
You know something about dad?

301
00:45:15,547 --> 00:45:18,258
No, I lost signal as soon
as we got into the island.

302
00:45:28,435 --> 00:45:29,811
Thank you for coming.

303
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:40,447
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

304
00:45:40,739 --> 00:45:43,241
I feel like I've been in this place before.

305
00:45:48,538 --> 00:45:51,291
The shaman is waiting for you.
We must begin.

306
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:55,669
Guys! Come on!

307
00:46:02,635 --> 00:46:03,636
Ángela!

308
00:46:06,681 --> 00:46:07,681
Take it.

309
00:46:09,559 --> 00:46:10,559
For what?

310
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:12,562
I don't know, to look after you.

311
00:46:13,563 --> 00:46:15,273
No need, thanks.

312
00:46:17,901 --> 00:46:20,069
- Everything will be fine.
- Fine?

313
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:23,031
This is madness. Mara has a gun.

314
00:46:23,865 --> 00:46:26,701
Drugs, weird people,
there's no signal...

315
00:46:27,076 --> 00:46:30,497
Well, look, this is
something of the real world

316
00:46:31,247 --> 00:46:32,499
so you won't get lost.

317
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:35,627
It's a watch.

318
00:46:36,211 --> 00:46:37,211
Excuse me.

319
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:41,007
Generally, it goes on the wrist
and it gives you the time.

320
00:46:42,467 --> 00:46:45,094
- Thank you.
- Remember to give it back to me

321
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:47,180
or I will get lost, OK?

322
00:46:49,182 --> 00:46:54,562
Abel, here. As a token...

323
00:47:41,651 --> 00:47:45,071
If anyone doesn't want to participate,
this is the moment to leave.

324
00:47:59,752 --> 00:48:03,840
Today, you will heal your heart,

325
00:48:05,884 --> 00:48:10,430
your thoughts, the spirit and the body.

326
00:48:11,806 --> 00:48:15,518
Today, you will cleanse your soul.

327
00:48:27,155 --> 00:48:31,200
Hello, Natalia.

328
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:39,792
We've been waiting for you.

329
00:48:59,562 --> 00:49:01,564
This is the sacred plant,

330
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:05,985
the entrance to the spiritual world.

331
00:49:07,236 --> 00:49:08,696
Everything that you brought

332
00:49:11,449 --> 00:49:13,618
will be revealed tonight.

333
00:54:16,003 --> 00:54:17,588
Let go of me.
She's my sister.

334
00:54:18,965 --> 00:54:20,549
It's the ayahuasca.

335
00:54:53,457 --> 00:54:55,918
It was him. He abuses me.

336
00:54:57,253 --> 00:55:00,715
Dad! He's behind the closet,
I can see him.

337
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,969
The black mass.

338
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:10,141
Please help her! It's my sister!

339
00:55:10,433 --> 00:55:14,645
You're not alone in this.
I've seen the prophecy.

340
00:55:16,314 --> 00:55:18,816
Don't be afraid of what
you're about to see.

341
00:55:20,609 --> 00:55:21,819
Goodbye, Natalia.

342
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:08,990
Papa!

343
00:57:26,735 --> 00:57:28,154
Please!

344
00:57:34,743 --> 00:57:37,705
You have to help me,
they're killing someone!

345
00:57:40,833 --> 00:57:43,919
Help me, please, help!

346
00:57:48,507 --> 00:57:50,509
They're after me.

347
00:57:51,302 --> 00:57:52,845
They tried to perform an abortion,

348
00:57:53,137 --> 00:57:54,817
we need to place her in a higher position!

349
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:57,224
Quickly, she's having contractions!

350
00:58:06,066 --> 00:58:07,985
Clean towels, hot water!

351
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:10,112
Scissors, gauze, alcohol!

352
00:58:10,404 --> 00:58:11,906
Hurry, hurry!

353
00:58:13,365 --> 00:58:15,451
Listen to me, listen!

354
00:58:16,202 --> 00:58:17,703
What's your name?

355
00:58:19,163 --> 00:58:22,166
Clara. My name is Clara.

356
00:58:22,458 --> 00:58:25,461
Clara, I'm sister Gregoria.

357
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:29,882
Relax, relax. I'm a midwife.

358
00:58:30,174 --> 00:58:36,430
- Please, save the baby!
- Yes, yes. We'll take the baby out

359
00:58:36,722 --> 00:58:39,225
and you'll be fine, but you need to help.

360
00:58:39,517 --> 00:58:44,730
No! Kill me! Just save the baby!

361
00:58:48,025 --> 00:58:50,819
They put the devil inside of me.

362
00:58:52,613 --> 00:58:54,490
He wants her for himself!

363
00:58:54,823 --> 00:58:55,823
Clara!

364
00:58:57,993 --> 00:58:59,537
Clara!

365
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:04,166
Quickly, tie her up!

366
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:07,545
Quickly! Hurry!

367
00:59:09,046 --> 00:59:10,506
What is happening, mother?

368
00:59:10,798 --> 00:59:12,466
Tie her up!

369
00:59:15,928 --> 00:59:17,846
Clara, can you listen to me?

370
00:59:23,102 --> 00:59:25,646
Clara! Clara!

371
00:59:29,275 --> 00:59:33,362
I am not Clara, you fucking midwife!

372
00:59:34,572 --> 00:59:36,115
Mother, be careful!

373
00:59:39,243 --> 00:59:44,373
I am the Mahonin that will devoir
her soul and her baby.

374
01:00:06,270 --> 01:00:09,648
I do not recognize you, nun.

375
01:00:14,903 --> 01:00:19,158
No, no! Not with that disgusting veil!

376
01:00:22,369 --> 01:00:25,831
Quickly, quickly! Scissors!

377
01:00:26,457 --> 01:00:28,000
Hurry, hold her legs!

378
01:00:28,667 --> 01:00:30,711
Tight, tight!
I don't want to hurt her.

379
01:00:32,212 --> 01:00:34,381
Hold her legs, hold her legs!

380
01:00:43,515 --> 01:00:45,976
Hold her tight.
I don't want to hurt her.

381
01:00:50,856 --> 01:00:54,068
She is leaving with me, nun!

382
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:57,946
Clara, you need to help me!
Push your baby out now!

383
01:01:06,455 --> 01:01:11,543
We exorcise you, evil spirit,
in the name of Our Lord, Jesus Christ.

384
01:01:16,507 --> 01:01:19,343
The Holy Cross commands you!

385
01:01:20,969 --> 01:01:24,264
I know you are here.
Fight for your child!

386
01:01:30,187 --> 01:01:31,355
What do we do?

387
01:01:31,647 --> 01:01:35,526
- We cannot do it.
- Yes, we can. Stand her up.

388
01:01:56,004 --> 01:01:58,298
Clara, don't let him take your child away!

389
01:01:58,632 --> 01:02:00,718
Fucking midwife!

390
01:02:01,009 --> 01:02:03,637
The child and the mother
will both die tonight!

391
01:02:03,929 --> 01:02:07,599
And so does your faith!

392
01:02:07,891 --> 01:02:10,227
Clara, fight for your daughter!

393
01:02:13,105 --> 01:02:14,106
Fight for her!

394
01:02:15,649 --> 01:02:19,278
Fight for her! Come on! Push!

395
01:02:21,530 --> 01:02:25,743
Clara, Push, push!

396
01:02:28,871 --> 01:02:35,002
The baby's coming!

397
01:02:39,381 --> 01:02:42,551
I have her, it's a girl!

398
01:02:46,889 --> 01:02:48,849
Thank you, God!

399
01:02:49,725 --> 01:02:53,562
I love you, my daughter!
Please, forgive me!

400
01:03:25,928 --> 01:03:30,182
You fucking nun!

401
01:03:38,816 --> 01:03:43,862
I christen you! I give you light!

402
01:03:44,196 --> 01:03:50,285
I name you, flesh of my flesh!

403
01:05:18,957 --> 01:05:20,000
Ángela.

404
01:05:28,342 --> 01:05:29,760
Ángela!

405
01:06:03,418 --> 01:06:04,753
Ángela?

406
01:06:33,907 --> 01:06:37,202
- Ángela!
- Don't get any closer!

407
01:06:38,704 --> 01:06:43,291
Mara, easy!
It's me, Natalia! Calm down!

408
01:06:45,544 --> 01:06:50,173
He's here! He won't let us out.

409
01:06:50,465 --> 01:06:52,217
Who?

410
01:06:52,676 --> 01:06:54,636
The devil.

411
01:06:58,473 --> 01:07:01,143
I brought her here to leave my dad.

412
01:07:01,977 --> 01:07:03,020
Give me the gun.

413
01:07:03,895 --> 01:07:06,690
- It's my dad's.
- Give me the gun.

414
01:07:07,524 --> 01:07:09,776
- It was in his closet.
- Give it to me.

415
01:07:13,321 --> 01:07:15,115
He left just like that.

416
01:07:21,955 --> 01:07:25,751
Now he's telling me I won't get out
until I finish what I started.

417
01:07:26,043 --> 01:07:27,252
Mara, please!

418
01:08:32,109 --> 01:08:32,484
Shh!

419
01:08:32,776 --> 01:08:36,238
Shut up or I'll rip your
tongue out, you got it?

420
01:08:38,949 --> 01:08:42,410
We need to leave right now!
I didn't do it!

421
01:08:42,869 --> 01:08:45,330
Where is Ángela?
What did you do to her?

422
01:08:45,622 --> 01:08:48,250
- Get off of me! Where is she?
- I don't know where she is.

423
01:08:48,542 --> 01:08:50,335
I heard screaming.
I heard Ángela's voice,

424
01:08:50,627 --> 01:08:52,337
I came in and found it like this.

425
01:08:52,629 --> 01:08:54,840
- I don't know where she is.
- What did you do to him?

426
01:08:55,132 --> 01:08:57,551
Nothing, I didn't do anything!

427
01:09:05,058 --> 01:09:06,726
Shh!

428
01:09:07,018 --> 01:09:08,520
Slut!

429
01:09:49,019 --> 01:09:50,019
Abel.

430
01:09:55,525 --> 01:09:56,525
Abel.

431
01:10:08,079 --> 01:10:09,079
Natalia.

432
01:10:12,375 --> 01:10:13,585
What happened?

433
01:10:28,725 --> 01:10:30,560
I woke up and I found her like this.

434
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:47,159
No!

435
01:10:50,247 --> 01:10:51,247
Ángela!

436
01:11:21,778 --> 01:11:23,154
What are we going to do?

437
01:11:24,656 --> 01:11:27,158
He brought us here and won't let us out.

438
01:11:46,761 --> 01:11:48,513
This thing I drank...

439
01:11:51,599 --> 01:11:53,601
It reminded me of who I really am.

440
01:11:54,853 --> 01:11:55,854
He's here.

441
01:11:57,063 --> 01:11:58,398
Inside of me.

442
01:12:04,404 --> 01:12:06,865
That voice I hear since
I was a child isn't mine.

443
01:12:13,455 --> 01:12:16,374
He always called me
cockroach, like my dad.

444
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:22,255
You need to leave, Natalia!

445
01:12:24,632 --> 01:12:25,632
Oh!

446
01:12:34,809 --> 01:12:37,937
Did you know on this island
they perform evil rites?

447
01:12:38,563 --> 01:12:40,940
I was brought here as a
child to cure my disease.

448
01:12:59,209 --> 01:13:00,794
Where are you going?

449
01:13:24,692 --> 01:13:26,319
"Everything that you brought

450
01:13:26,861 --> 01:13:29,864
will be revealed tonight."

451
01:13:56,224 --> 01:13:58,268
You will feel me, my virgin.

452
01:14:11,906 --> 01:14:13,700
Abel!

453
01:14:23,293 --> 01:14:25,837
You will serve me like your mother did.

454
01:14:30,133 --> 01:14:31,259
I told you I didn't do it.

455
01:14:32,135 --> 01:14:33,135
No!

456
01:14:34,637 --> 01:14:36,139
Son of a bitch!

457
01:14:37,223 --> 01:14:38,349
Let

458
01:15:03,666 --> 01:15:04,959
You killed her!

459
01:15:05,293 --> 01:15:06,653
You killed Ángela, son of a bitch!

460
01:15:06,878 --> 01:15:09,047
- He's not Abel
- Get out!

461
01:15:18,014 --> 01:15:19,307
Son of a bitch!

462
01:15:29,943 --> 01:15:31,236
Let go of me, freak!

463
01:16:41,723 --> 01:16:45,101
Please, call the police.

464
01:16:46,394 --> 01:16:47,937
We need to leave.

465
01:16:50,732 --> 01:16:52,108
He killed everyone.

466
01:16:53,568 --> 01:16:54,902
We're in danger.

467
01:17:01,492 --> 01:17:04,537
Calm down. He can't come in here.

468
01:17:06,456 --> 01:17:08,374
You don't understand, he's gone mad.

469
01:17:10,126 --> 01:17:11,753
He is not mad.

470
01:17:14,797 --> 01:17:16,341
He is possessed.

471
01:17:18,051 --> 01:17:22,013
Powerful men like your father came to this
island to perform rites with the devil.

472
01:17:22,305 --> 01:17:24,182
And they sacrificed the babies.

473
01:17:24,599 --> 01:17:26,225
You're cursed, Natalia.

474
01:17:26,684 --> 01:17:28,895
You survived a satanic rite.

475
01:17:38,154 --> 01:17:39,280
How do you know my name?

476
01:17:40,698 --> 01:17:42,492
This is the place you were baptized.

477
01:17:43,618 --> 01:17:44,744
I wasn't baptized.

478
01:17:48,289 --> 01:17:49,332
Who are you?

479
01:17:50,124 --> 01:17:53,002
It was the devil's touch
what made you so rare.

480
01:18:02,136 --> 01:18:03,763
I knew you would come back.

481
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:10,186
Natalia, it is time you accept your gift.

482
01:18:39,298 --> 01:18:42,677
Clara, you need to help me!
Push your baby out now!

483
01:18:51,853 --> 01:18:54,397
The child and the mother
will both die tonight!

484
01:18:54,689 --> 01:18:58,025
And so does your faith!

485
01:19:11,581 --> 01:19:13,040
Push, push!

486
01:19:23,718 --> 01:19:26,804
I love you, my daughter!
Please, forgive me!

487
01:19:37,732 --> 01:19:39,793
MAY THE CROSS GUIDE YOU
INTO THE LIGHT, BRAVE WOMAN...

488
01:19:39,817 --> 01:19:41,903
She came to me to save you.

489
01:19:44,322 --> 01:19:45,740
My sister was right.

490
01:19:47,867 --> 01:19:49,535
Why did all of this happen?

491
01:19:50,870 --> 01:19:52,622
The devil brought you here,

492
01:19:53,206 --> 01:19:54,415
and nothing will stop him.

493
01:19:55,917 --> 01:19:58,628
Sooner or later, he will find you again...

494
01:19:59,587 --> 01:20:02,006
And the story will repeat once more.

495
01:20:04,550 --> 01:20:06,761
Why didn't he kill me like the others?

496
01:20:07,512 --> 01:20:10,181
To recover what he lost when you survived.

497
01:20:11,349 --> 01:20:12,391
A baby.

498
01:20:14,519 --> 01:20:15,561
What's the boy's name?

499
01:20:20,149 --> 01:20:21,149
Abel.

500
01:20:23,110 --> 01:20:24,904
Abel is a virgin too.

501
01:20:27,281 --> 01:20:28,741
And that is not a coincidence.

502
01:20:30,618 --> 01:20:32,620
He is also a victim.

503
01:20:37,416 --> 01:20:40,294
- You felt something for him.
- What?

504
01:20:41,838 --> 01:20:45,258
The same forces that trap you
give you the key to escape.

505
01:20:47,176 --> 01:20:48,636
It is a universal law.

506
01:20:52,765 --> 01:20:54,809
Abel is your doom and your salvation,

507
01:20:55,685 --> 01:20:59,146
it is no coincidence that you
are destined to fall in love.

508
01:20:59,438 --> 01:21:01,732
He killed my sister and tried to rape me!

509
01:21:02,275 --> 01:21:06,070
The devil murdered your sister, not Abel.

510
01:21:06,779 --> 01:21:08,656
You have the gift to see this.

511
01:21:11,868 --> 01:21:12,868
Abel!

512
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:19,500
As soon as the devil appears, we
need to catch him and finish the rite.

513
01:21:20,001 --> 01:21:21,377
What rite?

514
01:21:21,961 --> 01:21:23,721
The one that started with
your christening...

515
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:25,965
The rite of exorcism.

516
01:21:26,549 --> 01:21:28,926
The devil anticipated the
ceremony and gave you a name.

517
01:21:33,556 --> 01:21:38,519
Our name is our identity, but
it also subdues us if we lose it.

518
01:21:39,312 --> 01:21:41,522
That is why we need you to recover it.

519
01:21:49,614 --> 01:21:51,574
Abel has been possesed since he was born.

520
01:21:54,869 --> 01:21:57,413
The ayahuasca did not wake the demon.

521
01:21:57,830 --> 01:21:59,498
It woke the boy asleep in him.

522
01:22:00,958 --> 01:22:03,461
It made him recover his memory.

523
01:22:06,631 --> 01:22:11,302
The ayahuasca will expel what is
left of the demon out of his body.

524
01:22:18,726 --> 01:22:21,896
Natalia, we have to keep going.

525
01:24:50,586 --> 01:24:52,505
He's here.

526
01:26:22,469 --> 01:26:26,849
I invoke you on the name of light
and life.

527
01:26:28,058 --> 01:26:31,437
And you, mother plant,
old and wise,

528
01:26:31,729 --> 01:26:36,901
along Mother Earh, Pachamama,
and all the elements

529
01:26:37,193 --> 01:26:41,322
that live inside her,
and also echo in me,

530
01:26:46,493 --> 01:26:50,039
so they can give me enough strength...

531
01:26:50,331 --> 01:26:53,626
- What are you doing?
- A boundary between him and us.

532
01:26:53,918 --> 01:26:57,004
He will not be able to go through it
as long as the demon is inside of him.

533
01:26:57,296 --> 01:27:00,132
And this is our circle of protection.

534
01:27:00,424 --> 01:27:03,010
You must not come out when he wakes up.

535
01:27:03,802 --> 01:27:09,225
I beg you to give power to this
salt creature, your creation.

536
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:16,482
To keep the snake's head
and its evil forces

537
01:27:16,774 --> 01:27:21,278
trapped inside its boundaries.

538
01:27:32,539 --> 01:27:35,751
The exorcism is performed
from the inside to the outside.

539
01:27:36,210 --> 01:27:38,963
The sacred plant will
look for the light in him.

540
01:27:39,838 --> 01:27:41,590
You need to make him drink it.
Quickly!

541
01:27:41,882 --> 01:27:44,718
- Me?
- Yes, this is between the two of you.

542
01:27:53,811 --> 01:27:59,608
Ayahuasca, mother plant, protect the mind,
the heart, the spirit and body

543
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:03,153
of these inocent souls,
and give them enough strength

544
01:28:03,445 --> 01:28:05,614
to recover their light.

545
01:28:09,702 --> 01:28:12,871
Deliver them from evil.

546
01:28:15,457 --> 01:28:17,293
Hurry, hurry! Get out!
Get out!

547
01:28:39,815 --> 01:28:44,111
I exorcise you, filthy spirit.
Infect diabolic legion,

548
01:28:44,403 --> 01:28:49,533
so you come out and escape from this recint
and this soul created in God's image.

549
01:28:52,161 --> 01:28:55,706
- Let me out, midwife!
- These are God's children.

550
01:28:56,373 --> 01:28:58,751
And I command you to leave them alone.

551
01:28:59,335 --> 01:29:01,128
They carry the mark for me since birth!

552
01:29:01,420 --> 01:29:03,088
And who is claiming?

553
01:29:04,548 --> 01:29:08,218
- You have no power over me, old woman!
- What is your name?

554
01:29:22,024 --> 01:29:27,654
You're told to do it by the Father,
the Son, the Holy Spirit,

555
01:29:27,946 --> 01:29:30,783
and all the forces of nature.

556
01:29:31,158 --> 01:29:33,619
You're told to do it by
the Holy Sign of the Cross,

557
01:29:33,911 --> 01:29:36,080
in virtue of all the mysteries of faith.

558
01:29:40,834 --> 01:29:41,834
Natalia.

559
01:29:44,046 --> 01:29:45,798
It's eating us from the inside.

560
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:48,300
Please help me!

561
01:29:58,685 --> 01:30:02,314
- What did you give me to drink?
- Holy water.

562
01:30:02,773 --> 01:30:04,441
Do not lie, midwife!

563
01:30:04,983 --> 01:30:07,736
It is holy because it
comes from the sacred plant.

564
01:30:08,404 --> 01:30:11,115
That is why you could not recognize it.

565
01:30:16,328 --> 01:30:17,871
And you think it will harm me.

566
01:30:18,497 --> 01:30:21,542
It is not for you, it is for Abel!

567
01:30:23,168 --> 01:30:24,878
That cockroach does not exist.

568
01:30:25,546 --> 01:30:28,632
He has always been an insect
and today he will be squashed.

569
01:30:29,007 --> 01:30:31,885
But first he will
serve me to fuck this one.

570
01:31:11,008 --> 01:31:14,678
These grimoires will not be of
any use to you, menopausal bitch!

571
01:31:15,637 --> 01:31:19,725
I raped your sister every night
and I devoured her soulless child.

572
01:31:20,350 --> 01:31:21,435
That's not true!

573
01:31:21,727 --> 01:31:24,563
- And I will do the same with yours.
- Do not listen to him!

574
01:31:24,855 --> 01:31:26,940
Your baptism does not exist, demon!

575
01:31:27,232 --> 01:31:28,525
It is God who claims us!

576
01:31:47,169 --> 01:31:49,379
Spit rocks, female!

577
01:31:51,924 --> 01:31:54,635
That's the quaternity
state I'm taking you on!

578
01:31:58,639 --> 01:32:02,601
What is the name that you
gave her, filthy beast?

579
01:32:27,960 --> 01:32:31,213
There is no way you
could expel me, midwife!

580
01:32:31,505 --> 01:32:33,298
I am inside her too!

581
01:32:33,590 --> 01:32:35,551
The connection is inevitable...

582
01:32:50,107 --> 01:32:51,900
I want you to come.

583
01:32:52,734 --> 01:32:55,153
We are going to do this
in front of the midwife.

584
01:33:06,456 --> 01:33:07,958
You are not going to take her!

585
01:33:10,168 --> 01:33:15,924
This is the sacred plant!
The entrance to the spiritual world.

586
01:33:17,384 --> 01:33:19,094
You have your light, Natalia!

587
01:33:44,703 --> 01:33:46,204
The soul is in the eyes.

588
01:35:08,537 --> 01:35:09,830
Abel!

589
01:35:39,401 --> 01:35:40,527
Abel!

590
01:36:04,092 --> 01:36:05,594
Abel.

591
01:36:09,639 --> 01:36:13,393
Natalia, your light can revert
the evil you suffered.

592
01:36:18,982 --> 01:36:20,108
Abel.

593
01:36:24,154 --> 01:36:25,238
Abel.

594
01:37:22,003 --> 01:37:23,505
It's very dark in here.

595
01:37:36,518 --> 01:37:37,518
I...

596
01:37:40,146 --> 01:37:42,357
I was able to steal him your name.

597
01:37:48,071 --> 01:37:49,071
Luciferina.

598
01:37:55,203 --> 01:37:56,203
I christen you.

599
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:00,040
I save you.

600
01:38:08,633 --> 01:38:09,926
Go away!

601
01:38:14,764 --> 01:38:15,974
Leave, now!

602
01:38:58,683 --> 01:39:03,563
"The same forces that trap you
give you the key to escape."

603
01:39:04,147 --> 01:39:06,024
"Abel is your doom and your salvation."

604
01:39:06,691 --> 01:39:08,693
"Why didn't he kill me like the others?"

605
01:39:09,653 --> 01:39:12,197
"To recover what he lost
when you survived."

606
01:39:13,573 --> 01:39:14,573
"A baby."

607
01:41:02,348 --> 01:41:03,808
I'm here.

608
01:41:19,616 --> 01:41:21,284
God is not with us anymore.

609
01:42:28,768 --> 01:42:30,228
We are alone.

610
01:42:31,020 --> 01:42:32,981
Like Adam and Eve in Paradise.

611
01:42:34,440 --> 01:42:35,817
And the serpent.

612
01:43:46,512 --> 01:43:50,225
He has no light.
The cockroach died.

613
01:44:42,735 --> 01:44:46,572
I dreamt about this place.
But this wasn't the dream.

614
01:46:09,364 --> 01:46:10,364
Abel?

615
01:46:12,700 --> 01:46:13,993
Abel!

616
01:46:22,251 --> 01:46:24,212
Abel, look at me!
It's me, Natalia!

617
01:46:24,921 --> 01:46:26,089
I told you the insect died!

618
01:46:26,381 --> 01:46:29,175
He didn't die because he
has the cross I gave him.

619
01:46:31,052 --> 01:46:34,222
You revealed my name,
now I know who I am.

620
01:46:34,514 --> 01:46:39,435
I'm Luciferina, bearer of light.
On that name, I invoke your light!

621
01:46:54,742 --> 01:46:57,662
This doesn't belong to you.
This belongs to the man I love.

622
01:47:00,957 --> 01:47:02,208
Abel.

623
01:47:18,433 --> 01:47:21,269
I know your name, and
by your name I expel you.

624
01:47:21,727 --> 01:47:24,021
Son of the morning,
creator of dawn,

625
01:47:24,355 --> 01:47:27,400
Lord of Light. I expel you, Lucifer.

626
01:47:27,733 --> 01:47:31,320
You are not the bearer of light anymore,
you are just a shadow.

627
01:48:01,934 --> 01:48:03,686
Natalia...

628
01:50:28,122 --> 01:50:29,624
Hello, Natalia.

629
01:50:32,627 --> 01:50:35,338
You need to help me find the other two...

630
01:50:38,507 --> 01:50:39,967
Before they do it.

631
01:50:41,802 --> 01:50:45,222
Do not worry.
You are in good hands.
