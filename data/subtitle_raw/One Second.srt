Who else could it be?

Yes.

24
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:32,042
Did it have the newsreel?

25
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:33,375
What?

26
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,500
The newsreel.

27
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,750
Go see for yourself.

28
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:39,083

If I knew you were a girl,
I wouldn't have hit you.

48
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,292
Why did you steal this? To sell it?

49
00:08:43,082 --> 00:08:44,542
None of your damn business.

50
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,125
Who are you?

51
00:08:50,667 --> 00:08:51,917
[Zhang Jiusheng] Buzz off.

52
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:54,042
How about we split it?

53
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:17,042
What kind of girl are you?

54
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:19,917
Running around at night,
and carrying a knife.

55
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:21,542
Give my knife back.

56
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:25,542
[Zhang Jiusheng] Where do you live?

57
00:09:29,167 --> 00:09:30,750
[Orphan Liu] Hey, I mean it.

58
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:33,208
Let's split it, alright?

59
00:09:36,167 --> 00:09:38,750
How about give me 12.5 meters?

60
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,208
12.5 meters? What for?

61
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,333
Nothing. Just give it to me.

[He exhales heavily]

74
00:12:52,167 --> 00:12:54,167
You're from the second unit?

75
00:12:55,417 --> 00:12:56,625
Yes.

76
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:00,000
I'm from the fourth unit.

77
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:04,958
Why are you by yourself?

78
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,000
I'm looking for someone.

79
00:13:08,292 --> 00:13:09,917
Who are you looking for?

80
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,833
I'm telling you,

81
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:16,417
you can't just roam around here.

82
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:19,292
It's an empty desert.

83
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,625
If I didn't pick you up,

84
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:24,500
you'd have died of thirst.

85
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:40,042
[Horn honks loudly]

86
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:44,125
Pick that person up.

87
00:13:44,292 --> 00:13:46,458
- No, not enough room.
- She's the one I'm looking for!

88
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,583
Who is she?

89
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:50,667
My daughter. She ran away three days ago.

90
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,833
Hey, stop the truck!

91
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,625
Alright. Hurry up!

92
00:14:13,542 --> 00:14:15,167
You think you can run?

93
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:17,083
This kid.

94
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:18,375
Terrible.

95
00:14:18,417 --> 00:14:19,708
[Engine revs]

96
00:14:41,042 --> 00:14:43,000
Did you steal something and run away?

97
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,667
[He scoffs]

98
00:14:44,792 --> 00:14:47,625
How can you be so crazy, kid?

99
00:14:47,792 --> 00:14:49,708
Your dad has chased you for days.

100
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,167
Who?

101
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,333
Your dad over there.

102
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:57,125
Him? My dad is dead to me.

103
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,625
I should slap you.

104
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:00,458
How can you say that?

105
00:15:00,542 --> 00:15:02,500
He's been worried sick about you.

106
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:04,708
Did you know that?
You're lucky you ran into me.

107
00:15:04,792 --> 00:15:08,250
What if he died of thirst?
You'd have no home to cry in.

108
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:13,542
Kid, I don't know your family business.

109
00:15:14,042 --> 00:15:16,833
But no matter how far you run,
he's still your father.

110
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:20,208
You only have one father. Right?

111
00:15:20,292 --> 00:15:22,583
Don't do something you'll regret.

112
00:15:28,042 --> 00:15:29,167
Alright.

113
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:32,375
You two are in my truck,
so you have to listen to me.

114
00:15:33,292 --> 00:15:35,167
Say sorry to your dad.

115
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:41,083
Fine. Sorry is sorry.

116
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:43,625
He <i>is</i> my dad.

117
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,667
You know what kind of guy he is?

118
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,042
What kind of guy is your dad?

119
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:48,917
He has a mistress.

120
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,875
Our family doesn't have enough to eat

121
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:53,042
but he took a whole year's harvest

122
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,458
and gave it to his mistress.

123
00:15:56,042 --> 00:15:57,417
My mum tried to stop him

124
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:58,917
and they argued.

125
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:00,542
He threatened to divorce her.

126
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,292
My mum got ill.

127
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:06,958
She couldn't afford medicine.

128
00:16:07,417 --> 00:16:09,417
It's just me and my little brother.

129
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:12,458
Now that she's dead.

130
00:16:15,792 --> 00:16:17,250
My brother is still young.

131
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:18,833
I don't have a job.

132
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:22,083
We can't go on like this,
so we went to look for him.

133
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:24,792
He wouldn't open his door.

134
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,333
We knocked on the door for ages.

135
00:16:27,417 --> 00:16:30,167
Finally his mistress
came out, fists flying.

136
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:32,250
Beating me and my little brother.

137
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:33,875
Enough.

138
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:36,958
That's just like my dad.

139
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:40,917
Are you human?

140
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,292
Totally heartless! Worse than a dog!

141
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:47,333
Actually, I'm not her father.

142
00:16:47,417 --> 00:16:48,792
Now, you're in denial?

143
00:16:48,917 --> 00:16:51,958
He chased me all this way
just to take my can.

144
00:16:52,042 --> 00:16:55,042
Inside is the money and food stamps
my mum left me.

145
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:56,833
He even wants to take that.

146
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:01,917
Give her the can!

147
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:07,541
[Driver] You hand her the can now!
Damn thug!

148
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:09,291
[Man] You believe her?

149
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:12,041
Stop!

150
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,583
Quick, stop the truck!

151
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,291
Telling <i>me</i> to stop?

152
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:18,541
Fuck off!

153
00:17:29,667 --> 00:17:31,417
[Motorcycle engine revs]

154
00:17:40,542 --> 00:17:43,125
[Zhang Jiusheng] Hey! Little bastard!

[Zhang Jiusheng yells]

157
00:17:52,542 --> 00:17:55,083
I can't stop! If I stop, it will break!

158
00:18:01,542 --> 00:18:03,333
[Zhang Jiusheng] Stop that truck!

159
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,500
It has the film!

160
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,208
Stop it!

161
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:09,167
The film reel!

162
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,083
Stop that truck!

163
00:18:16,667 --> 00:18:19,208
You idiot!

164
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,333
[Indistinct chatter in the background]

165
00:18:49,167 --> 00:18:52,125
NOTICE: <i>HEROIC SONS AND DAUGHTERS

166
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,042
[Woman] Mr. Movie,
what time is the screening?

167
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:17,125
The film hasn't arrived yet, calm down.

168
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,250
- Have some peanuts.
- Alright, alright.

169
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,208
- [Woman] Eat some seeds.
- [Woman 2] When does the film arrive?

170
00:19:22,292 --> 00:19:25,500
That depends on whether Yang He
screws up or not.

171
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:28,708
[Man] <i>Heroic Sons and Daughters</i> again?
What about <i>Fighting North and South</i>?

172
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:30,958
<i>Heroic Sons and Daughters</i> is better.

173
00:19:31,042 --> 00:19:32,250
[Woman] Definitely.

174
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:34,208
<i>Heroic Sons and Daughters</i> is better.

175
00:19:34,292 --> 00:19:36,625
We like <i>Heroic Sons and Daughters</i>.

176
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,708
What's so great about
<i>Fighting North and South</i>?

177
00:19:43,792 --> 00:19:46,042
- Mr. Movie, noodles?
- [Mr. Movie] Yes.

"Dad" is eating your noodles.

185

Is it tough to watch?

186
00:21:06,542 --> 00:21:07,792
Sit.

187
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:12,833
[He slurps]

188
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,917
Reporting, comrade projectionist,

189
00:21:34,542 --> 00:21:36,042
the film!

190
00:21:48,042 --> 00:21:49,458
What film?

191
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:59,375
Reel six of <i>Heroic Sons and Daughters</i>.

192
00:22:30,417 --> 00:22:32,625
It really is <i>Heroic Sons and Daughters</i>.

193
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:45,417
Where did you get this?

194
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:50,292
I'm just returning it.

195
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:52,500
Come back.

196
00:22:59,417 --> 00:23:00,667
Sit.

197
00:23:03,542 --> 00:23:04,917
Sit down!

198
00:23:15,542 --> 00:23:16,958
I know you.

199
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:20,208
Aren't you Orphan Liu
from our second unit?

200
00:23:22,708 --> 00:23:25,417
Comrade, you're not
from our second unit, are you?

201
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:29,208
I'm from the first unit.

202
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:31,542
The first unit?

203
00:23:32,542 --> 00:23:34,833
Then how do you two know each other?

204
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:37,917
And how did the reel end up in your hands?

205
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:43,208
Am I wrong to return the reel to you?

206
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:47,583
Of course not.

207
00:23:48,167 --> 00:23:51,875
Good comrades should explain good deeds.

208
00:23:53,417 --> 00:23:54,708
- Waiter.
- [Waiter] Yes.

209
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,625
- Bring two more bowls of noodles.
- [Waiter] Okay.

210
00:23:56,667 --> 00:23:57,833
It's on me.

211
00:23:58,542 --> 00:24:00,167
And bring my stuff over.

212
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:01,625
Okay, coming.

213
00:24:04,417 --> 00:24:06,125
[Mr. Movie] Your noodles. Okay.

214
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:11,500
I put extra hot peppers in the noodles.

215
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:14,375
Please get me a good seat
at the screening.

216
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:15,750
Consider it done.

217
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:28,500
[Mr. Movie] Do you know why I get
extra hot peppers?

218
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:34,958
It's because I'm highly respected
by the revolutionaries of the second unit.

219
00:24:36,958 --> 00:24:40,083
Do you know why everyone
calls me Mr. Movie?

220
00:24:41,167 --> 00:24:43,750
Because I've been screening movies
my whole life.

221
00:24:43,833 --> 00:24:46,250
And I've never made a mistake.

222
00:24:47,875 --> 00:24:52,083
Screening movies here is serious business.

223
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,750
It's a tough crowd out there.

224
00:24:54,833 --> 00:24:57,208
They've been waiting for months.

225
00:24:57,292 --> 00:24:59,917
Each time it's like
a New Year celebration.

226
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:04,333
Film reels are treasures to us.

227
00:25:05,417 --> 00:25:08,167
However many come in,
the same number must be returned.

228
00:25:08,458 --> 00:25:11,250
We check the count several times.

229
00:25:11,333 --> 00:25:13,458
This is called taking responsibility.

230
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,292
THE WORLD'S BEST PROJECTIONIST

231
00:25:18,292 --> 00:25:21,250
How did this reel get separated?

232
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,792
How are you two connected to Yang He?

233
00:25:27,833 --> 00:25:29,208
The guy on the motorcycle?

234
00:25:29,542 --> 00:25:30,750
That's right.

235
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:33,708
He transports the reels.
His name is Yang He.

236
00:25:35,292 --> 00:25:36,292
Hmm.

237
00:25:36,542 --> 00:25:39,208
How did this reel end up in your hands?

238
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,208
We picked it up on the road.

239
00:25:45,542 --> 00:25:47,000
Which road?

240
00:25:47,583 --> 00:25:49,583
The road from the first unit.

241
00:25:53,042 --> 00:25:55,875
This must have been poorly secured
and fell off the bike.

242
00:25:56,917 --> 00:25:59,708
And Yang He wants to be a projectionist?

243
00:25:59,792 --> 00:26:01,042
If he were the projectionist,

244
00:26:01,083 --> 00:26:04,167
it would be a nightmare
for our second unit comrades!

245
00:26:06,583 --> 00:26:09,292
- Was this the only reel on the road?
- Yes, just this one.

246
00:26:10,375 --> 00:26:11,458
Comrade, what's your name?

247
00:26:14,625 --> 00:26:17,458
What do you do in the first unit?

248
00:26:19,792 --> 00:26:22,042
She could have brought it back alone.

249
00:26:22,083 --> 00:26:23,625
Why are you here?

250
00:26:26,417 --> 00:26:28,375
He's a bad element. A vandal.

251
00:26:31,333 --> 00:26:32,500
Who?

252
00:26:32,708 --> 00:26:33,917
You.

253
00:26:34,625 --> 00:26:35,958
I'm what?

254
00:26:36,208 --> 00:26:38,208
I said you're a bad element. A vandal.

255
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:41,208
- What makes you think I'm a bad element?
- You are a vandal!

256
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:43,167
Why don't you tell him
about your business?

257
00:26:43,208 --> 00:26:44,750
- You're a vandal.
- When did I sabotage...

258
00:26:44,792 --> 00:26:45,833
[Mr. Movie] Shut up.

259
00:26:48,875 --> 00:26:50,958
I knew from the start you're bad.

260
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:53,958
- Alert the Security Division.
- Right. Alert the Security Division.

261
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:56,292
[Mr. Movie] What are you doing?

262
00:26:56,333 --> 00:26:57,292
Why are you alerting
the Security Division?

263
00:26:57,333 --> 00:26:58,625
- What did you do?
- Why are you...?

264
00:26:58,667 --> 00:27:00,917
- Why did you come here?
- I came to watch the movie.

265
00:27:02,125 --> 00:27:04,208
My daughter is in the movie.
I came to watch my daughter.

266
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:06,000
Your daughter
is in <i>Heroic Sons and Daughters</i>?

267
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:08,917
Your daughter plays Wang Fang,
the protagonist of the movie?

268
00:27:08,958 --> 00:27:11,458
You're a liar.
Go talk to the Security Division.

269
00:27:12,583 --> 00:27:16,500
Before the movie, the newsreel!
My daughter is in the newsreel!

270
00:27:17,167 --> 00:27:18,542
[Mr. Movie] Wait a minute.

271
00:27:19,042 --> 00:27:22,458
The newsreel reports national affairs.
The great achievements of Chairman Mao.

272
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,958
We must study the newsreel.
Should we study your daughter?

273
00:27:25,083 --> 00:27:27,708
Her school teaches labour and farming
to serve the people.

274
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:30,000
Someone saw the newsreel
and wrote me a letter.

275
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:31,333
What letter?

276
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,083
- Your daughter is a student?
- Yes, a student

277
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:49,667
[Boy, shouting] Mr. Movie! Big problem!
We can't watch the movie!

278
00:27:49,708 --> 00:27:51,583
Ah? What happened?

279
00:27:52,958 --> 00:27:55,250
- [Boy] We can't screen the movie!
- [Mr. Movie] What?

280
00:28:05,125 --> 00:28:06,667
[Indistinct chatter]

281
00:28:06,708 --> 00:28:08,833
[Man] Mr. Movie is here!

282
00:28:10,375 --> 00:28:11,542
[Mr. Movie] Oh, shit!

283
00:28:11,833 --> 00:28:13,167
Big problem.

284
00:28:14,167 --> 00:28:15,792
Yang He!

285
00:28:15,958 --> 00:28:17,250
Where's Yang He?

286
00:28:20,667 --> 00:28:22,625
Where the hell is he?

287
00:28:24,167 --> 00:28:25,792
Say something.

288
00:28:26,125 --> 00:28:27,125
Dad.

289
00:28:27,625 --> 00:28:30,125
It was me, dad.

290
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:32,583
- You drove the carriage?
- Yes.

291
00:28:32,625 --> 00:28:35,250
Why are Yang He's reels on your carriage?

292
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:38,708
His motorcycle broke down again.
It wasn't repaired.

293
00:28:38,875 --> 00:28:41,250
He insisted I bring the reels to you.

294
00:28:41,333 --> 00:28:43,458
[Mr. Movie] And this is how
you carried it?

295
00:28:43,625 --> 00:28:45,875
You think you're pulling a donkey?
You got it all twisted up!

296
00:28:45,917 --> 00:28:47,667
Like a donkey's intestines!

297
00:28:48,375 --> 00:28:50,542
I don't have eyes in the back of my head.

298
00:28:50,625 --> 00:28:52,500
Who knew this stuff could roll out?

299
00:29:09,083 --> 00:29:10,125
Where's the tape?

300
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:15,208
- The tape sealing the can.
- I wrapped it around my whip.

301
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,708
[Mr. Movie] Why the hell did you do that?

302
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,542
[Mr. Movie's son] My whip
was falling apart.

303
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:21,083
You're afraid the whip will fall apart.

304
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:23,583
But you're not afraid
the reels will get damaged?

305
00:29:23,625 --> 00:29:26,042
What are we supposed to watch then?

306
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:27,917
You shithead!

307
00:29:28,917 --> 00:29:30,542
Isn't that a reel in your hand?

308
00:29:30,625 --> 00:29:32,333
Just switch to that one
and problem solved.

309
00:29:32,375 --> 00:29:34,042
Switch them my ass!

310
00:29:34,125 --> 00:29:35,500
This is a drama.

311
00:29:35,583 --> 00:29:38,208
That's the newsreel.
They're totally different.

312
00:29:38,292 --> 00:29:40,250
You think men and women are the same?

313
00:29:40,333 --> 00:29:42,125
You really have shit for brains.

314
00:29:43,042 --> 00:29:44,583
No. 22.

315
00:29:45,208 --> 00:29:47,542
The letter said Newsreel No. 22.

316
00:29:47,792 --> 00:29:49,917
Now it's just like twisted up intestines.

317
00:29:49,958 --> 00:29:51,542
It doesn't matter who is in No. 22.

318
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:53,042
[Wind blows]

319
00:29:55,292 --> 00:29:58,042
Comrades, no screening today.

320
00:29:58,125 --> 00:29:59,250
[They grumble]

321
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:02,000
We can't watch the Newsreel,
but we can still watch the movie.

322
00:30:02,083 --> 00:30:03,083
[Crowd] That's right.

323
00:30:03,167 --> 00:30:06,083
Under this situation,
how could we screen the movie?

324
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,458
Everyone can see.

325
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,917
No movie today.

326
00:30:10,083 --> 00:30:11,250
But it's not our fault.

327
00:30:14,917 --> 00:30:16,292
You can screen it.

328
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,750
There is a way.

329
00:30:17,833 --> 00:30:18,917
How?

330
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:21,917
Don't you have fluid
that can wash this?

331
00:30:21,958 --> 00:30:23,750
- You mean cleaning fluid?
- Yes

332
00:30:23,792 --> 00:30:24,917
I don't.

333
00:30:26,167 --> 00:30:28,792
And it's way too dirty!

334
00:30:28,833 --> 00:30:30,167
How can I clean it?

335
00:30:30,375 --> 00:30:31,833
You tell me!

336
00:30:33,292 --> 00:30:34,833
Do you understand?

337
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:37,208
[Mr. Movie] You think you're smart.

338
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,042
Nevertheless,

339
00:30:45,958 --> 00:30:48,500
..we could make one last attempt

340
00:30:48,708 --> 00:30:50,208
and try to rescue it.

341
00:30:50,583 --> 00:30:52,042
Do you all want to watch the movie?

342
00:30:52,167 --> 00:30:54,625
Yes, yes!

343
00:30:54,792 --> 00:30:55,792
[Mr. Movie] Alright.

344
00:30:55,875 --> 00:30:57,375
If you want to watch the movie.

345
00:30:57,833 --> 00:31:00,667
Please come forward
and be the witnesses

346
00:31:00,917 --> 00:31:04,458
that today's big accident
is Yang He's sole responsibility.

347
00:31:04,542 --> 00:31:07,625
[Crowd] Right, it is!

348
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:11,292
Additionally, I have two requirements.

349
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:13,500
If we succeed, we can watch the movie.

350
00:31:13,625 --> 00:31:15,625
If we fail, no screening!

351
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:19,083
[Crowd] We can do it! Alright!

352
00:31:19,167 --> 00:31:22,542
First, we all
have to keep quiet about this.

353
00:31:22,583 --> 00:31:24,542
This incident cannot leak out.

354
00:31:24,667 --> 00:31:27,625
Otherwise, our second unit
will never screen movies again.

355
00:31:27,792 --> 00:31:29,417
We will all suffer.

356
00:31:30,875 --> 00:31:34,333
Second, superiors will deal with Yang He

357
00:31:34,708 --> 00:31:36,917
I will deal with the reel.

358
00:31:37,542 --> 00:31:41,417
Female comrades, go fetch bed sheets,
masks, and gauze,

359
00:31:41,458 --> 00:31:43,458
steamers, chopsticks and basins.

360
00:31:43,625 --> 00:31:47,333
Male comrades,
go fetch cleaned size 12 steel wire.

361
00:31:47,417 --> 00:31:48,708
Alright?

362
00:31:48,792 --> 00:31:50,125
[Crowd] Alright!

363
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:53,083
[Mr. Movie] Get me these things
right away!

364
00:31:53,167 --> 00:31:54,458
Action.

365
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,208
[Crowd chatters, indistinctly]

366
00:31:56,917 --> 00:31:58,292
Get out of here.

367
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:03,708
Walk around. Don't damage the reel.

368
00:32:08,333 --> 00:32:10,167
[Wind blows]

369
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:19,042
[Chickens cluck]

370
00:32:24,667 --> 00:32:26,000
Put the film down!

371
00:32:26,125 --> 00:32:27,375
I picked this up!

372
00:32:27,417 --> 00:32:29,750
- You took the part with my daughter!
- Impossible!

373
00:32:29,958 --> 00:32:32,333
Impossible or not, just put it down!

374
00:32:34,958 --> 00:32:36,917
[Dogs bark]

375
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:41,792
[Insects chirp]

376
00:32:48,208 --> 00:32:49,958
[He pants]

377
00:32:52,167 --> 00:32:54,250
[Wind blows]

378
00:32:58,125 --> 00:33:00,292
[He wheezes]

379
00:33:21,792 --> 00:33:24,292
[Distant chant]

380
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:31,083
[Chanting intensifies]

381

[Chanting continues]

383

[Wind intensifies]

384
00:34:25,208 --> 00:34:26,958
Show yourself!

385
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,500
Give me the film!

386
00:34:30,792 --> 00:34:34,083
Give me the film of my daughter!

387
00:34:34,292 --> 00:34:36,333
Come out!

388
00:34:55,083 --> 00:34:57,083
[Chanting fades]

389
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:11,500
This doesn't have your daughter.

390
00:35:23,167 --> 00:35:24,333
Not there, right?

391
00:35:24,458 --> 00:35:26,708
It's all white.
It's just the beginning part.

392
00:35:32,125 --> 00:35:33,958
Take it. I don't want it.

393
00:35:34,292 --> 00:35:35,708
It's ugly.

394
00:35:36,125 --> 00:35:38,500
What do you want film for anyway?

395
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:40,500
And why does it matter how it looks?

396
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:43,333
To make a lampshade.

397
00:35:43,833 --> 00:35:45,042
A lampshade?

398
00:35:48,667 --> 00:35:51,167
My little brother is a good student.

399
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:52,958
He loves to read.

400
00:35:53,792 --> 00:35:55,708
But our lamp at home is too dim.

401
00:35:56,292 --> 00:35:58,417
I'm afraid he'll damage his eyesight.

402
00:35:58,583 --> 00:35:59,958
So I borrowed a lamp.

403
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:03,042
The lampshade was made of film.

404
00:36:03,958 --> 00:36:06,542
He accidentally burned the lampshade.

405
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,167
Now they bully us.

406
00:36:10,375 --> 00:36:11,917
We're in debt everyday.

407
00:36:12,333 --> 00:36:14,833
He's too afraid to leave the house.

408
00:36:15,917 --> 00:36:17,500
He is so scared

409
00:36:18,542 --> 00:36:20,125
and helpless.

410
00:36:20,167 --> 00:36:22,125
[Chanting resumes]

411
00:36:24,625 --> 00:36:27,250
So what you said on the truck is true?

412
00:36:43,208 --> 00:36:44,708
What's your name?

413
00:36:48,542 --> 00:36:49,625
Orphan Liu.

414
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:53,042
I know you're Orphan Liu.
I'm asking your real name.

415
00:36:53,083 --> 00:36:55,375
It's just Orphan Liu.
My little brother is Little Boy Liu.

416
00:36:55,625 --> 00:36:57,125
Is that his real name, too?

417
00:36:58,583 --> 00:36:59,833
We have no parents.

418
00:36:59,875 --> 00:37:01,833
The police station
just gave us these names.

419
00:37:08,292 --> 00:37:10,292
[Chanting continues;
Wind blows]

420
00:37:24,708 --> 00:37:27,083
Don't cause trouble tonight.
Let me watch the movie.

421
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,500
After that, I'll help you.

422
00:37:36,625 --> 00:37:38,375
What can you do?

423
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:43,000
[Orphan Liu] Hey, what's your name?

424
00:37:43,042 --> 00:37:45,125
Why are you afraid
of the Security Division?

425
00:37:53,875 --> 00:37:55,750
[Indistinct chatter]

426
00:37:59,167 --> 00:38:00,667
Steady.

427
00:38:01,458 --> 00:38:02,958
Steady.

428
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,125
Take it up the stairs.

429
00:38:07,958 --> 00:38:09,125
Good.

430
00:38:10,417 --> 00:38:11,750
Careful.

431
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,125
[Chatter continues]

432
00:38:19,625 --> 00:38:21,917
[Mr. Movie] You all
follow my instructions.

433
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:25,333
Come on, turn it over.

434
00:38:26,083 --> 00:38:27,208
Step aside.

435
00:38:27,458 --> 00:38:28,583
Come on.

436
00:38:29,458 --> 00:38:31,542
A little more that way.

437
00:38:33,333 --> 00:38:35,333
Release your hands.

438
00:38:35,875 --> 00:38:37,083
Good.

439
00:38:37,417 --> 00:38:39,750
Very good.

440
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:52,083
This end cannot be moved.

441
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:53,542
Chopsticks.

442
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,167
Get chopsticks.

443
00:38:58,625 --> 00:39:00,417
Follow it from the start

444
00:39:00,792 --> 00:39:02,500
and find the other end.

445
00:39:02,625 --> 00:39:05,083
Whatever you do, don't scratch it.

446
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:06,333
Okay.

447
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:09,958
Raise the screen
and keep everyone outside.

448
00:39:10,083 --> 00:39:11,250
[Man] Alright.

449
00:39:11,792 --> 00:39:13,750
[Crowd cheers]

450
00:39:16,417 --> 00:39:18,000
[Mr. Movie] What are you
clapping for?

451
00:39:18,042 --> 00:39:19,833
We still haven't found
the start of the reel.

452
00:39:19,875 --> 00:39:21,250
[Crowd laughs]

453
00:39:30,208 --> 00:39:31,792
Here, straighten it.

454
00:39:32,583 --> 00:39:35,375
[Loud choral music;
Indistinct chatter]

455
00:39:59,458 --> 00:40:02,500
[Mr. Movie] Hold the sides,
not the middle.

456
00:40:06,875 --> 00:40:09,792
Wash both sides. Remove the dirt.

457
00:40:31,875 --> 00:40:33,833
[Children chatter, indistinctly]

458
00:40:39,625 --> 00:40:41,583
Distilled water only.

459
00:40:41,833 --> 00:40:45,417
The condensation creates distilled water.

460
00:40:46,292 --> 00:40:48,083
Don't get it dirty.

461
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:50,292
[Mr. Movie] Great, steam it!

462
00:40:51,333 --> 00:40:53,833
Careful, careful, step aside!

463
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,583
The distilled water is here!

464
00:41:03,417 --> 00:41:06,125
You, careful where you step.

465
00:41:06,292 --> 00:41:07,833
Don't spill anything.

466
00:41:09,458 --> 00:41:12,208
Move aside, make way up ahead!

467
00:41:15,208 --> 00:41:17,292
[Mr. Movie] Squeeze excess water out.

468
00:41:18,958 --> 00:41:20,708
Then we start to wipe.

469
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:24,167
Not too loose, not too tight.

470
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,458
Wipe downwards.

471
00:41:27,333 --> 00:41:29,417
One direction only.

472
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,167
Remember this point.

473
00:41:32,667 --> 00:41:34,500
Repeat this action.

474
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,833
Wipe it in sections.

475
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:43,292
- Got it?
- [Group] Got it.

476
00:41:43,333 --> 00:41:45,333
- [Mr. Movie] Okay, let's start.
- [Group] Alright.

477
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,500
Hey!

478
00:41:51,083 --> 00:41:52,417
These aren't pig intestines!

479
00:41:52,792 --> 00:41:54,250
Let me see your fingernails.

480
00:41:54,542 --> 00:41:57,042
No, stop, stop, stop!

481
00:41:57,458 --> 00:41:59,417
Female comrades, stay.
Male comrades, leave.

482
00:41:59,458 --> 00:42:01,833
Quickly, quickly. Children leave too.

483
00:42:02,375 --> 00:42:04,250
Bring fans over.

484
00:42:04,292 --> 00:42:05,417
[Man] Alright.

485
00:42:05,667 --> 00:42:08,542
[Mr. Movie] It's delicate work,
not like separating noodles.

486
00:42:10,208 --> 00:42:11,333
I know...

487
00:42:11,917 --> 00:42:13,458
I know how to develop photos.

488
00:42:14,333 --> 00:42:16,083
- You?
- [Zhang Jiusheng] Yes.

489
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,750
- You've developed photos?
- I can also enlarge prints.

490
00:42:20,458 --> 00:42:21,875
Go wash your hands.

491
00:42:22,208 --> 00:42:23,958
- Use soap, twice.
- Okay.

492
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:26,250
- Wash your face too.
- Okay.

493
00:42:36,417 --> 00:42:38,292
You've really done this before.

494
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
After it's cleaned, you can screen it?

495
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:51,042
As long as it's clean, I can screen it.

496
00:42:52,542 --> 00:42:53,875
Look everyone.

497
00:42:54,708 --> 00:42:57,083
It's hard work to rescue a reel.

498
00:42:57,542 --> 00:43:00,000
So many people want to be a projectionist.

499
00:43:00,333 --> 00:43:01,958
Like that Yang He.

500
00:43:02,458 --> 00:43:07,333
That bastard was a pig farmer
leveraging his brother's position.

501
00:43:07,375 --> 00:43:09,000
Trying to replace me.

502
00:43:09,042 --> 00:43:10,083
I won't let him.

503
00:43:10,125 --> 00:43:11,833
[Women] Right, definitely not.

504
00:43:16,458 --> 00:43:18,542
[Bicycle bell rings in the background]

505
00:43:42,792 --> 00:43:44,667
[He whispers] What did I tell you?

506
00:43:44,958 --> 00:43:46,667
Are you making trouble again?

507
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:48,667
[She whispers] Who's making trouble?

508
00:43:48,875 --> 00:43:50,750
I came to help clean the film.

509
00:43:52,792 --> 00:43:54,125
Get lost.

510
00:43:54,167 --> 00:43:55,542
Why?

511
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:57,375
Can't I help?

512
00:44:12,917 --> 00:44:14,417
You just wait!

[Dog barks;

516
00:45:18,458 --> 00:45:20,583
Where have you been these days?

517
00:45:20,958 --> 00:45:23,042
Did our neighbour feed you?

518
00:45:23,083 --> 00:45:25,833
[Little Boy Liu] Yes.
She asked where you went.

519
00:45:25,875 --> 00:45:27,542
[Orphan Liu] It's got extra hot peppers.

520
00:45:27,667 --> 00:45:28,792
Smell good?

521
00:45:30,333 --> 00:45:31,625
Eat up.

522
00:45:56,083 --> 00:45:57,917
Sister, you eat too

523
00:45:58,333 --> 00:45:59,958
I've already eaten.

524
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:03,625
We'll watch the movie later,

525
00:46:03,667 --> 00:46:05,208
<i>Heroic Sons and Daughters.</i>

526
00:46:05,833 --> 00:46:07,167
[Little Boy Liu] I'm not going.

527

[Orphan Liu] All the kids are going.

528
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:12,333
I'm not going.

529
00:46:13,458 --> 00:46:15,417
Did they come harass you again?

530
00:46:16,292 --> 00:46:17,958
[Insects chirp]

531
00:46:20,125 --> 00:46:22,083
- [Door slams]
- [Zhang Jiusheng] Let's go.

532
00:46:23,042 --> 00:46:24,458
What's holding you back?

533
00:46:25,125 --> 00:46:26,667
Why are you here?

[He breathes heavily]

Little Boy Liu...

536
00:46:46,083 --> 00:46:48,833
..your sister told me you
burned a lampshade?

537
00:46:55,875 --> 00:46:57,292
It's alright.

538
00:46:58,333 --> 00:46:59,750
You can still watch the movie.

539
00:46:59,792 --> 00:47:01,125
No need to fear.

540
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:07,208
The bullies are going too, right?

541
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:08,250
What are you going to do?

542
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:11,000
If they bully you again, tell me.

- [Door opens]
- What can <i>you</i> do?

544
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:17,917
Fight them off. What else?

00:47:24,625 --> 00:47:27,292
Sister, who is he?

546
00:47:28,125 --> 00:47:29,583

But, before the film is dry,
don't move around too much,

552
00:47:44,958 --> 00:47:47,042
otherwise, you'll stir up dust.

Be careful, everyone.

Don't touch the film, it's not dry yet.

560

Too many people creates poor circulation.

If you fan, it will dry quickly.

Where did you get it?

- Orphan Liu gave it to me.

From a labour camp?

Yes, escaped from a labour camp.

- About ten minutes...
- I mean when will you send No. 22 back?

Then two months later,
we will screen newsreel No. 23.

For fighting.
