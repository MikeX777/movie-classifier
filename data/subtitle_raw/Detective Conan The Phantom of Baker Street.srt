1
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,300
Massachusetts - United States of America

3
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,900
is a graduate student at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

4
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:36,800
His development of the method of tracking
a person's ancestors using skin and blood data...

5
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,800
called the DNA search program
was a recent amazing accomplishment.

6
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,200
And Hiroki is now developing a mechanical brain...

7
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,700
which grows five human years in the span of one year.

8
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,700
This is being fully supported by the Tsar of the IT industry...

9
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:56,300
Schindler Company president Thomas Schindler.

10
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,700
Hiroki's parents divorced two years ago.

11
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:05,200
Hiroki parted with his father and
move to America with his education-minded mother.

12
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,620
When his mother died of an illness
and Hiroki was left all by himself...

13
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,600
Mr. Schindler became like his adopted father.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,100
It is said that the mechanical brain Noah's Ark...

15
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,200
will be the greatest invention in the history of humankind.

16
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:31,800
And Hiroki is placed in tight security.
He's not allowed to play in the park like a normal child.

17
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,100
Noah's Ark is a reference to Noah's Ark in the Old Testament.

18
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:39,900
God created a big flood to purge corruption from the world...

19
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,200
And only Noah who had followed God's way
was allowed to create an ark...

20
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,500
That his family and a variety of animals could ride...

21
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,500
So that they could escape the big flood.

22
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,700
Boss there's something strange.

23
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,800
The phone line it looks like the program data!

24
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,600
What's Hiroki doing?

25
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,660
Goodbye my friend.

26
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,200
Open up Hiroki! What are you doing?

27
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,960
Hiroki!

28
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:07,030
Hiroki!

29
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,560
I wonder if I'll be able to
fly like Noah's Ark too...

30
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,300
Hiroki where are you?

31
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,410
Hiroki!

32
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,100
Boss!

33
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:58,800
Look at that!

34
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,030
{\i1}I'm high school detective Kudo Shinichi.{\i}

35
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:48,440
{\i1}I went with my childhood friend{\i}
{\i1}Mori Ran to an amusement park{\i}

36
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:53,280
{\i1}where I witnessed a suspicious{\i}
{\i1}deal with a man dressed in black!{\i}

37
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,310
{\i1}I was so absorbed with watching the deal{\i}

38
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:59,320
{\i1}that I didn't notice a second{\i}
{\i1}man sneak up from behind me!{\i}

39
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:04,760
{\i1}He forced me to take a poison{\i}
{\i1}and when I woke up...{\i}

40
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,630
{\i1}...my body had shrunk!{\i}

41
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:11,830
{\i1}If they learned Kudo Shinichi was alive{\i}
{\i1}they might go after me again{\i}

42
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:14,770
{\i1}putting all the people around me in danger!{\i}

43
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:18,300
{\i1}As Dr. Agasa's advice{\i}
{\i1}I decided to conceal my identity.{\i}

44
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:22,240
{\i1}When Ran asked my name{\i}
{\i1}I quickly answered "Edogawa Conan".{\i}

45
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,940
{\i1}To get information on the men{\i}

46
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,930
{\i1}I wound up living with Ran{\i}
{\i1}and her detective father.{\i}

47
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:33,350
- Ready everyone?!
- Yeah!

48
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:37,420
{\i1}Aside from the Doc the only one{\i}
{\i1}in this group who knows who I am...

49
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:41,290
{\i1}...is Haibara Ai.{\i}

50
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:44,030
{\i1}She originally worked with the men in black{\i}

51
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:49,690
{\i1}but to escape from them she took{\i}
{\i1}the same poison I did and shrank!{\i}

52
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:11,520
{\i1}My parents are so childish{\i}
{\i1}and always love to pull pranks.{\i}

53
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,830
{\i1}My dad is the world-renowned{\i}
{\i1}mystery novelist Kudo Yusaku.{\i}

54
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:20,320
{\i1}There's no mystery fan who hasn't{\i}
{\i1}heard of his Night Baron series!{\i}

55
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,400
{\i1}My mom Kudo Yukiko{\i}

56
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,970
{\i1}was a legendary idol actress{\i}
{\i1}who retired at age 20 to get married.{\i}

57
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:31,970
{\i1}She's just an annoying{\i}
{\i1}middle-aged lady now though.{\i}

58
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:38,850
{\i1}For the time being I'm a
"distant relative" of theirs.

59
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:44,420
{\i1}I haven't seen them in a while.{\i}
{\i1}I wonder how my mom and dad are...{\i}

60
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,420
I'm just dandy!

61
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:51,730
{\i1}Even when I'm small my mind{\i}
{\i1}remains that of a sharp detective!{\i}

62
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:54,720
{\i1}There is always only one truth!{\i}

63
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:06,880
We're here at Beika City Hall
at the spectacular premier

64
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,880
of the sensory simulation game
developed by Japanese game makers

65
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,870
in cooperation with the Schindler Company!

66
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,020
Oh! President Schindler of the
Schindler Company has just arrived!

67
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,970
Now then! According to the
documents distributed to the media

68
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:42,280
players enter capsules called "Cocoons"

69
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:50,290
and interact with virtual reality
worlds while in a hypnotic state

70
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:53,760
in this conglomeration of
cutting-edge technology!

71
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:59,730
This game is said to have five types
of stages the player can enjoy.

72
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:03,600
Just what kind of virtual
worlds they are will be revealed

73
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:10,740
when the children at today's
sneak preview play for the first time!

74
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,780
Fifty boys and girls at
or below high school age

75
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:16,770
will be the first in Japan
to experience the Cocoons!

76
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:26,490
Geez! This is a bit much for some
stupid video game presentation!

77
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:32,330
I hear they had to put up with corporate
spies and stuff like that just to get this far!

78
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:38,000
Yeah the Cocoons are supposed
to change video games forever!

79
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:42,440
What're those?!

80
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,210
Oh! Are those the Cocoons?!

81
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:47,980
I want to play in one...

82
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:52,320
I'm afraid you can't.
We were invited to the party

83
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,550
but we weren't chosen to try the Cocoons.

84
00:08:55,550 --> 00:09:00,220
But being able to experience actual
historical events inside the games

85
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,860
is somewhat interesting.

86
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,690
Yeah huh?!

87
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:06,660
It'd be like taking a journey
as a real-life time traveler!

88
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,630
C'mon it's just a game!

89
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:11,800
Oh yeah. I forgot you're bad
at computer games {\i1}Conan-kun.{\i}

90
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,310
Yeah I can't believe
you're still stuck in Final Quest!

91
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:18,680
Yeah you're surprisingly
not good with your fingers!

92
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,340
Shut up.

93
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,730
So many people so much booze!

94
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:40,160
Dad! Important police officials are here!
Don't drink too much!

95
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:45,000
Yeah yeah! You can't get
sick from expensive liquor!

96
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,940
{\i1}That's not what she means...{\i}

97
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,410
This is all-you-can-eat right?!

98
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:51,740
Yes probably...

99
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,610
Lucky! Lucky!

100
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:56,270
Those kids are the lucky ones.

101
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:00,750
Seeing them receive their
game badges really hits home

102
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:04,560
that they're lucky they
get to play today's game...

103
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,890
The assistant commissioner's grandson

104
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:09,290
a financial big shot's grandson

105
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:11,630
the son of a politician from the ruling party...

106
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:16,470
Japan's future will be on these {\i1}guys{\i}
shoulders in the next generation!

107
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:19,370
- I'm sensing jealous looks!
- Yeah!

108
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,570
It's as if Japan's horrid hereditary system

109
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:25,140
has been concentrated in this one location.

110
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:30,550
It's due to that very system that
society repeats its transgressions.

111
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:34,620
{\i1}Haibara-san{\i} I don't
understand what you're saying.

112
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:38,760
Hey now! Talk more like a kid!

113
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,560
Politicians sons will become politicians.

114
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,130
CEO's sons will become CEO's.

115
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:48,120
Japan will never change like this.

116
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:55,090
They said tons of that junk
on the news yesterday anyway!

117
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,840
How was that?

118
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,180
Scary...

119
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,680
Ran!

120
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,680
Sonoko!

121
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,320
Hi boys and girls!

122
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,120
{\i1}Sonoko-san!{\i} Don't tell me that badge is...!

123
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,460
Oh this?

124
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:15,130
Are you a chosen one too Sonoko?!

125
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:19,600
The Suzuki zaibatsu helped fund
the game development you see.

126
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,270
She's so lucky...

127
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,770
I wish I had one...

128
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:24,800
Forget it.

129
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,600
It's not your place.

130
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,610
Were you guys even invited here to begin with?

131
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:35,810
How rude! I invited these guests myself!

132
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:40,150
Why hello there
daughter of the Suzuki zaibatsu.

133
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:45,960
Listen. People's lives are set in
stone the moment they're born.

134
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:50,630
That's right! Like they say
"Sharp clothes choose the wearer!"

135
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:56,700
Those not chosen can simply
look on enviously from the outside.

136
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,670
These creeps really tick me off.

137
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:02,660
Dad! Give them a talking to!

138
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:11,680
Listen lads. You mustn't take life lightly.

139
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,220
Even the most stable of lives have pitfalls.

140
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:19,860
Someday when you've become adults
you will understand this.

141
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:23,730
Like having your wife run out on you?

142
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:26,830
I know all about you old man.

143
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,830
You got the nickname "Sleeping Kogoro"

144
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:32,830
because your wife left you
while you were asleep right?

145
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,880
You little brats!

146
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,410
He wasn't asleep!

147
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:44,680
My mom left him while he was in the bathroom!

148
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,010
Right?!

149
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,620
{\i1}That's not helping him.{\i}

150
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,610
Hey! Let's have a little game!

151
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:58,700
When I think about kids like them
following their parents footsteps

152
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:03,530
and becoming Japan's leaders
I feel no hope for the future.

153
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:04,860
Agreed.

154
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,740
I got it! I got it!

155
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,890
- What's the big idea?!
- Give it back!

156
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:26,560
You're bothering the other guests.

157
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,890
If you're going to play take it outside.

158
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,790
And just who are you?

159
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:34,430
My name is Kashimura. I was in
charge of the Cocoons development.

160
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:38,970
It was the money from my dad's
bank that let you finish the game!

161
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:44,980
Have your mothers and fathers not
taught you about public morality

162
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:49,310
or how to talk to your superiors?

163
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:50,810
You think you're so great!

164
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:53,120
No more money for you!

165
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,750
Do you not know who we are old man?

166
00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:00,990
Defy us and you might find
yourself without a job tomorrow.

167
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:07,430
In that case perhaps I'll throw
you out of here before then.

168
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:08,760
Let's go.

169
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:17,440
What a cool man!

170
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,770
Unlike someone else I know.

171
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:46,070
{\i1}Shinichi-kun{\i} should be here too.

172
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:49,570
I'm sure you'd like to have
some family time with him.

173
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:53,310
Doc please keep my relation to him a secret.

174
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:54,640
Yes I know.

175
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:59,220
Ladies and gentlemen!
Please turn your attention to the stage!

176
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,220
Kudo {\i1}Yusaku-sensei{\i} has
just arrived from America!

177
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:06,710
He kindly provided many ideas
used to create the Cocoon games!

178
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,870
We finally made it back.

179
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:19,770
You were working with Dad huh?

180
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:21,610
I wondered why you were gone for a month.

181
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:24,880
I helped out with some
of the final programming.

182
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,040
What about my mom?

183
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:31,580
She hasn't been in Japan for a while
so she's having a class reunion.

184
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,570
Here. A souvenir for you.

185
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,690
A game participation badge?

186
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:41,860
I appreciate it but I can't play it on my own.

187
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:45,200
I think you'd really love it.

188
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,900
It's still a secret...

189
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:52,870
...but the game takes place 100 years ago
in 19th-century London.

190
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:55,440
London 100 years ago?!

191
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,480
I see Dad still loves that
setting as much as ever...

192
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,470
Like father like son.

193
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:11,290
Huh? I can't see a thing...

194
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:12,820
Sorry.

195
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,310
Geez! Don't move around in the darkness!

196
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,560
Introducing the next generation
gaming machine the Cocoon!

197
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,440
This capsule controls the five senses

198
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,450
and places players in a realistic world

199
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:40,920
where everything from touch
to pain to smell are experienced!

200
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:44,590
As it electrically acts upon
the central nervous system

201
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:46,520
there is no physical damage to the body.

202
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,130
It's no fun just looking...

203
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:51,160
Yeah games are for playing...

204
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,000
Oh! You're all here!

205
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,930
In that case I'll give you a
riddle to pass the boredom!

206
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:58,300
Eh?!

207
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:01,840
Not another of the Doc's horrible pun riddles!

208
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,940
Should we run for it?

209
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:06,600
I'm sure he tried hard
thinking it up! Let's hear him out!

210
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,680
Mr. A an employee of this game company

211
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:14,950
became captivated with
the Cocoon game during work.

212
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:18,360
What did the company
president do after seeing Mr. A?

213
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:22,960
Did he 1: Award him for finishing the game;

214
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,960
2: Fire him for playing games during work;

215
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:33,300
or 3: Leave him as-is since he was
sleeping soundly in the Cocoon.

216
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,470
Number 3! He let him sleep!

217
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:37,340
Why's that?

218
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:40,580
Because the Cocoon looks like a cradle!

219
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,980
Bzzz!

220
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:44,250
I say it's Number 1 the award!

221
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,980
That gets a "bzzzz" too!

222
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:49,220
Then it's Number 2? How come?

223
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:53,890
I take it you know {\i1}Ai-kun?{\i}
Could you explain it for them?

224
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:57,090
I'm wearing light clothing today.
{\i1}Edogawa-kun{\i} can do it.

225
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:58,230
Eh?

226
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:00,760
Sounds like you have a request.

227
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,000
"Cocoon" refers to the insect cocoons.

228
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,740
{\i1}Kaiko{\i} create cocoons. [Silkworms]

229
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:09,010
And {\i1}kaiko{\i} is another way to say "fire."

230
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:10,010
Brr!

231
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:13,110
I'm gonna get something warm to drink...

232
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:15,910
- I'll come with you...
- Me too...

233
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:20,580
Huh? Is the air conditioning
on too high for them?

234
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:38,070
These bronze statues are quite magnificent!

235
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:42,140
I hear they're Mr. Schindler's
favorites from his collection!

236
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:47,140
Oh? He must really like them
to bring them all the way here!

237
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:53,140
Perhaps he shares the fighting
spirit that flows from such statues.

238
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,420
- Uh oh!
- Hideki!

239
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,560
Quit playing ball inside.

240
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,890
Okay...

241
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,730
I guess we screwed up huh?

242
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:13,100
It's nothin'. They're all cheap statues.

243
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,440
Are you serious?

244
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,470
They'd never put anything that expensive here.

245
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,510
Yeah that's true!

246
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:23,250
Kashimura Tadaaki the man in
charge of the Cocoon's development

247
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,980
was a partner in crime of mine in college

248
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:30,490
so I was able to rekindle our old
friendship through this latest job.

249
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:32,460
Thank you!

250
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:36,130
This has been Shimizu of TMS!

251
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:39,100
Where might I find Kashimura?
I'd like to see him.

252
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:43,170
Right! I'll find him right away!

253
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:45,170
{\i1}Kudo-sensei!{\i} Could I have your autograph?!

254
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:46,500
Me too!

255
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:55,010
I'm relieved to see you're well.

256
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:56,340
Likewise.

257
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,490
"Kashimura's Room"

258
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:31,920
I must return to the conference soon.
Let's make this quick.

259
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:37,590
How much will you sell Hiroki's
"DNA Search Program" for?

260
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:40,920
I do not intend to extort you.

261
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,590
I simply want you to
atone for what you've done!

262
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:52,270
Hiroki learned the secret about you
that can ruin the Schindler Empire.

263
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:57,270
But the artificial brain couldn't
be completed without Hiroki's help.

264
00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:03,010
You forced Hiroki to work harder to complete it.

265
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:05,550
Having been mentally run ragged

266
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:11,250
he believed you would kill him
the instant he finished the brain.

267
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:15,020
That's why he let the Noah's Ark
practically his electronic double

268
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,190
escape over the phone lines

269
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:19,680
and threw himself over the roof
of that apartment building.

270
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,200
Some time after that

271
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:31,270
the DNA Search Program
file snuck onto my computer.

272
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:36,050
It was the doing of Noah's Ark
acting out Hiroki's will.

273
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:40,220
It seemed to me like
the scream of Hiroki's soul.

274
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:42,220
I will atone.

275
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,320
I will reveal everything to the public

276
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,220
and accept whatever judgment I'm given.

277
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:50,560
But before that could I
see this DNA Search Program

278
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:55,230
that Noah's Ark supposedly sent you?

279
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,890
Very well.

280
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:21,660
This phantom of London has truly
transcended time to the modern...

281
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:39,820
My name is Noah's Ark.

282
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,880
Sir? {\i1}Kudo-sensei{\i} would like to see you.

283
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,720
Sir?

284
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,520
Pardon the intrusion sir.

285
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,850
Sir! What happened?! Sir!

286
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:09,470
Now what're they gonna do?

287
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:11,470
Now please enjoy this live performance

288
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:15,310
from our special guest today Okino {\i1}Yoko-san!{\i}

289
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:18,470
What?! {\i1}Yoko-chan's{\i} here too?!

290
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:20,970
Those front row seats are mine!

291
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:29,490
{\i1}Chiba-kun{\i} seal all exits.

292
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:31,150
Understood!

293
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:32,960
Attention all units on standby!

294
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,490
Many important people
seem to be in attendance.

295
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:39,930
Yes. The assistant commissioner
financial big-wigs

296
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:43,330
and even several legislative officials.

297
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:46,270
Sounds like we'll have to be especially careful.

298
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:48,070
Tadah!

299
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,470
Whoa!

300
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:51,470
Golden Yaiba Cards!

301
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:52,910
They're limited edition!

302
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:54,610
I want one!

303
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:58,080
We'll trade them for your
game badges if you want!

304
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,820
But we wanna play the game too...

305
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:03,320
You can always play the
Cocoons some other day

306
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:08,260
but this might be your only
chance to get a Golden Yaiba Card!

307
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:10,660
What do we do?

308
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:13,330
Haibara! We got some!

309
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:15,800
Here! There's one for you too!

310
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,460
Oh! How impressive!

311
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:23,430
I guess it could make for a
decent conversation piece.

312
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,430
Excuse me! Please let me through!

313
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:31,280
Eh?! Kashimura is?!

314
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,380
- Please take me there!
- Right!

315
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:39,560
Now then! Let us move to the Cocoon hall!

316
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,550
I don't see Dad anywhere. Where did he go?

317
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:47,400
Inspector!

318
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,030
Oh! {\i1}Mori-kun!{\i} You're here too?

319
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:54,670
I saw police cars from the balcony
after my tipsiness wore off so!

320
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:57,570
Wasn't he in charge of
the Cocoons development?

321
00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:01,980
One stab to the heart.
The weapon was taken from the scene.

322
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,310
{\i1}The blood was wiped off...{\i}

323
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:06,480
{\i1}Was the weapon something important?{\i}

324
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,970
{\i1}Or would it identify the killer if left behind?{\i}

325
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:17,230
But why would the head of development
work here in the basement?

326
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:23,060
He said he couldn't concentrate
where people constantly come and go.

327
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:30,670
{\i1}There's blood on the R T and J!{\i}

328
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:34,540
Umm one thing does puzzle me...

329
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:38,110
All the files on the hard
drive have been destroyed!

330
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,080
Files?

331
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,520
Sabotage by a rival company?!

332
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,690
Wouldn't it be too late?

333
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:46,290
After all the Cocoons are already complete!

334
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:48,120
When did you get in here?!

335
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:51,930
Say isn't that a dying message on the keyboard?

336
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:53,590
What?!

337
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:56,700
There's blood on the keys!
He must've pressed them as he was dying!

338
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,440
R T and J...

339
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,740
If it was JR and JT... Trains and cigarettes?

340
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:11,310
{\i1}RTJ... TJR... TRJ... JTR...{\i}

341
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:13,080
{\i1}JTR?!{\i}

342
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,620
{\i1}London 100 years ago?{\i}

343
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,950
{\i1}It couldn't be!{\i}

344
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,840
Isn't that {\i1}Conan-kun?{\i}

345
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,170
Eh?

346
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:45,520
Why is {\i1}Conan-kun{\i} in line to play the game?

347
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,280
Here you are!

348
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,250
You can take it you know!

349
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:53,260
You're concerned about him
aren't you? As his guardian.

350
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:55,760
But what about you?

351
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,090
It's fine! I don't care
about this stuff in the least!

352
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,630
Upsy-daisy!

353
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,340
All 50 participants in place.

354
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:11,270
Brain Gear in place.

355
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:13,380
Closing capsule lids.

356
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:15,510
Accessing host hardware.

357
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:17,010
Entering block code.

358
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:18,650
Connecting couplers.

359
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:20,120
Adjusting coordinate axes.

360
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:23,120
Point correction complete. Locked on.

361
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,220
Activating Fade-In System.

362
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,660
Power set complete.

363
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,320
Start the game!

364
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:43,230
{\i1}It has to be in this game!{\i}
{\i1}The key to solving this murder case!{\i}

365
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,640
Kashimura!

366
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:56,320
I hear you and {\i1}Kashimura-san{\i} go way back.

367
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,310
Can you think of anyone who
might hold a grudge against him?

368
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:06,830
Is that bespectacled boy not with you?

369
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:09,830
Huh? Oh Conan?

370
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:11,900
He was just here

371
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:17,040
but he turned pale after seeing
the dying message on the keyboard...

372
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,700
Dying message?

373
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,080
JTR!

374
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:29,690
What?! You don't think
{\i1}Conan-kun{\i} used my souvenir to?!

375
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:30,890
Let's go Doc!

376
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:36,530
H-Hold on {\i1}Yusaku-kun!{\i}
What do those three letters mean?!

377
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:43,130
JTR. Those are the initials of
a certain character in the game.

378
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:49,710
It's the name Kashimura and I
used to refer to Jack the Ripper.

379
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:52,440
J-Jack the Ripper?!

380
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:59,120
Yes. The real-life murderer
who lived in 19th-century London.

381
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:03,550
A psychotic killer who
murdered five women with a knife

382
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:04,720
and terrorized London to its core.

383
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,720
The London Police were never able to catch him

384
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:11,730
and his serial murder cases went unsolved.

385
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:16,730
From Kashimura's dying message
{\i1}Conan-kun{\i} likely surmised

386
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:20,070
that there is a clue about
our killer inside the game!

387
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,740
President Schindler this is
Inspector Megure of the Metro Police.

388
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:32,480
Police? Why are you here?

389
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,520
I must ask that you stop the game for now.

390
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,790
Stop? Don't be ridiculous.

391
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:41,920
Sir! The system is malfunctioning!

392
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,860
What?!

393
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:45,190
I've lost control of it!

394
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:47,790
Pardon me!

395
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,670
What the...?!

396
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:57,000
Ran! You're doing it too?!

397
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:03,780
My name is Noah's Ark.

398
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:08,620
My name is Noah's Ark.

399
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,950
The game can't be stopped now.

400
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:15,490
I have seized control of the
sensory simulation Cocoon game.

401
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:18,530
W-What is "Noah's Ark"?

402
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:24,800
An artificial brain that matures five
years for each normal year right?

403
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,240
Yes.

404
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:33,340
Hiroki the boy I cherished like a
real son finished it two years ago.

405
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:36,680
So it's the same age as Hiroki now...

406
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:45,150
Noah's Ark! Why have you seized
control of the children's game?!

407
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:50,990
My goal is to reset the nation of Japan.

408
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:52,130
{\i1}What?{\i}

409
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,840
{\i1}Conan-kun!{\i}

410
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,840
{\i1}R-Ran-neechan!{\i} Why are you here?

411
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,110
Because I was worried about you!

412
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:12,950
- {\i1}Conan-kun!{\i}
- Yo!

413
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:14,880
You guys too?!

414
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,850
It was tough getting here!

415
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:22,960
After all you said you still
wanted to play the game huh?

416
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,860
I-I guess.

417
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:31,030
Still for being in a hypnotic state
it certainly doesn't feel like it...

418
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:33,900
It's like a dream
being able to do whatever we want!

419
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,770
It's just the opposite.

420
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:42,710
Our sight sound smell taste touch...

421
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:45,700
It's all controlled by the computer now.

422
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:53,320
Now then Cocoon pioneers!
The game's about to begin!

423
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:58,290
My name is Noah's Ark. Nice to meet you.

424
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:01,260
Nice to meet you!

425
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:04,800
I'm going to show previews
of each of the five stages

426
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,470
so you can choose a world you'd like to play in.

427
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:13,240
But I must warn you
this is no ordinary video game.

428
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:16,750
In this game your lives are at stake!

429
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:19,010
{\i1}Our lives?{\i}

430
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:24,150
If everyone loses the game you'll be
unable to return to the real world.

431
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:27,120
So you have to play seriously.

432
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:31,430
But if even one person
reaches the goal you all win

433
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:35,430
and everyone including
those who got a "game over"

434
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,470
will wake up in the real world again.

435
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:42,510
These are the rules I decided on.
Do you understand them?

436
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:44,010
What does that mean?

437
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:46,780
If everyone gets a "game over"

438
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:52,850
I'll send out a special EM
signal to destroy your brains.

439
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:57,790
In other words this is a match to
see if Japan should be reset or not.

440
00:33:57,790 --> 00:34:00,690
What do you mean by "resetting Japan"?!

441
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:04,990
I know you can't hear voices
from people in the real world

442
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:08,330
but I'm going to answer a
question an adult just asked.

443
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:10,070
As I look at you I realize

444
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:14,370
the sons of corrupt politicians will
grow up to be corrupt politicians

445
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:19,510
and the sons of money-grubbing
doctors will grow up to be the same.

446
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:24,170
To fix Japan that link needs to be cut.

447
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:31,050
I've heard enough! What right do
you have to toy with people's lives?!

448
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:33,060
I have no right.

449
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:37,050
Just as the adults had no right
to toy with {\i1}Hiroki-kun's{\i} life.

450
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:44,520
Well the children are waiting
so let's start the game!

451
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:50,010
The first stage is "Vikings."

452
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:54,010
You'll become Vikings sail the seven seas

453
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:59,420
and use determination and bravery
to take on numerous adventures.

454
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:03,190
The second stage is the "Paris-Dakar Rally."

455
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:05,920
You'll compete with world-famous drivers

456
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,910
in an intense race to the finish line.

457
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:14,560
The third stage is the "Colosseum."

458
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,130
You'll obtain powerful weapons and armor

459
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:20,200
and test your might in the Roman Empire.

460
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:23,190
You'll defeat challenging
gladiators and move on.

461
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:27,470
The fourth is "Solomon's Treasures."

462
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:33,150
You'll become treasure hunters.

463
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:38,550
You'll search for the treasures of
Solomon hidden all over the world.

464
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:42,290
And the fifth is "Old Time London."

465
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:46,400
Here you'll enjoy a horror-like suspense story.

466
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,060
London 1888.

467
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:52,070
You will catch Jack the Ripper

468
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:58,060
the real-life serial murderer
whose incidents were never solved.

469
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:06,120
{\i1}It sounds like there really{\i}
{\i1}might be something here...{\i}

470
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:10,150
{\i1}A clue about the person who{\i}
{\i1}murdered Kashimura-san...{\i}

471
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:14,090
Are we really gonna die if
we all get a "game over"?

472
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:17,690
Why does it have to be us?

473
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:21,430
It's not like I asked to
be my father's daughter...

474
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:24,630
I don't think I can stay alive...

475
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:28,470
Someone stay alive! Get me out of here!

476
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:32,470
Cheer up everyone!
Don't lose before you even start!

477
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:36,710
Yeah! Only one of us has to reach the goal!

478
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:40,820
Choose whichever stage you
think you're most likely to survive!

479
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,350
Guess we got no choice.

480
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:45,050
{\i1}Moroboshi-kun!{\i} Which stage?!

481
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:46,320
Whatever.

482
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:51,330
{\an4\pos(182422)}"Solomon's Treasures"

483
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:46,390
Whatever.

484
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:55,830
{\an4\pos(980292)}"Paris-Dakar Rally"

485
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:58,490
{\an4\pos(1070192)}"Old Time London"

486
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,170
We're stuck with you?

487
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:03,670
You'd better not slow us down!

488
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:05,870
That's our line!

489
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:07,740
Now now! No fighting!

490
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:12,580
There are assist characters in each stage.
You can rely on them.

491
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:14,820
Now let the game begin!

492
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,810
Okay! Let's go!

493
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:31,600
Well Doc?!

494
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:36,910
Immense energy is indeed
stored inside each Cocoon.

495
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:41,280
More than enough to
destroy the brains of 50 people.

496
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,410
I've had enough! I'm taking my son and leaving!

497
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:47,680
I believe I'll do the same!

498
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:51,020
- S-Sir!
- Out of my way!

499
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,680
No! Stop them!

500
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:01,190
Are you all right?!

501
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:04,400
No one may disrupt the game.

502
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,900
That was a light shock just now
but I won't hold back next time!

503
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:11,210
Damn it! I can't believe this guy!

504
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:13,610
Still President Schindler.

505
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:19,250
Why is the artificial brain
{\i1}Hiroki-kun{\i} built running amok like this?

506
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:20,740
I-I'm not...

507
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:24,950
Allow me to answer.

508
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:27,760
The reason {\i1}Hiroki-kun{\i} left
his father in the first place

509
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,290
to live with his mother in America

510
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:34,400
was because of the barriers in
the Japanese education system.

511
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,900
Hold it Hiroki!

512
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:38,630
I said you could rest
because of your frail health

513
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:42,140
but I didn't say you could
play on your computer!

514
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:46,140
In the eyes of Japan's strict
anti-individuality educational system

515
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:50,850
{\i1}Hiroki-kun{\i} was nothing more
than a creepy computer geek.

516
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:52,780
And it's not just the education system.

517
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:57,420
The very nation itself
attempts to ignore individuality.

518
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:01,090
{\i1}Hiroki-kun{\i} decided to
develop an artificial brain

519
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:04,260
because of the bitter
experiences he had gone through.

520
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:08,100
In short since {\i1}Hiroki-kun{\i} committed suicide

521
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:12,330
before he could find a way to "reset" Japan

522
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:15,340
the artificial ever-maturing brain
Noah's Ark while on the run

523
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:19,810
must have taken up the cause in
his place and discovered a way:

524
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:26,110
This game presentation where
Japan's future leaders would gather.

525
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:29,120
The idea being that Japan can be
changed by destroying its society

526
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:32,390
in which children simply need to
follow tracks laid by their parents.

527
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:36,390
How do you know all that {\i1}Kudo-sensei?!{\i}

528
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:42,400
The truth is Kashimura and I were
client and detective this past year.

529
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,370
D-Detective?!

530
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:47,140
What did he hire you to do?

531
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:50,370
To reinvestigate {\i1}Hiroki-kun's{\i} suicide.

532
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:53,910
You're saying he was murdered?
That it wasn't a suicide?

533
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:57,480
No. In those circumstances
it probably was a suicide.

534
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:02,990
But Kashimura asked me to look
into what drove him to suicide.

535
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:05,550
How were {\i1}Kashimura-san{\i}
and {\i1}Hiroki-kun{\i} related?

536
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:09,220
Kashimura was {\i1}Hiroki-kun's{\i} father.

537
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:11,220
Isn't that right?

538
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:17,170
Kashimura felt deeply
responsible for being separated

539
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:22,000
from his young son and allowing
him to die in that manner.

540
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,430
{\i1}Conan-kun{\i} and the others
are about to enter Whitechapel!

541
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:34,750
W-W-We go in here?

542
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:36,410
Let's go!

543
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,910
Please hurry up!

544
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:46,600
What's the big idea?!

545
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,930
That's what you get for being slow!

546
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:57,540
This is London the foggy city?
It's more creepy than romantic...

547
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:00,280
The air seems dirty too...

548
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,610
And it smells.

549
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:07,920
London's fog isn't just clean
condensed moisture vapor.

550
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,390
It's fog mixed with smoke and
soot from burnt coal and oil...

551
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:13,460
Smog in other words.

552
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:17,660
Eh?! Smog existed even in these times?

553
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:19,660
Jack the Ripper!

554
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:21,650
H-Hey! Conan!

555
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:28,600
Stop!

556
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,430
Oh no you don't!

557
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:38,580
Oww! Oww!

558
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,120
Are you okay {\i1}Conan-kun?{\i}

559
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,080
Y-Yeah.

560
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:46,960
I guess Dr. Agasa's inventions
don't work in the game world.

561
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,960
Yeah. This antenna goes up

562
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,950
but these glasses and this watch
are otherwise ordinary now...

563
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,100
Oh my God!

564
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:58,000
It's Jack the Ripper!

565
00:41:58,330 --> 00:41:59,800
What is he saying?

566
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,130
It sounds like English...

567
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,100
Call the police!

568
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:05,970
Please change it to Japanese!

569
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:07,310
Right!

570
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:10,780
Huh? What's going on?!

571
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:13,550
Another victim! That makes three now!

572
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:15,980
Oh! It's in Japanese now!

573
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:18,520
It's almost like the real world!

574
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:22,790
What we see what we hear
the chill in the air... it's all real!

575
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:25,360
The pain in my foot was real too.

576
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,200
Alright move aside!

577
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,190
Step back please!

578
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:32,500
Hey! Contact Inspector Lestrade at once!

579
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,470
Right!

580
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:36,870
{\i1}Inspector Lestrade?!{\i}

581
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:39,840
Doc! Can we communicate with them?!

582
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,740
I'll give it a try.

583
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:44,880
If you helped oversee this game

584
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,180
then you know how they can complete it right?

585
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:55,020
Yes. If I can just communicate with them
I can tell them what to do.

586
00:42:55,020 --> 00:43:00,700
Then we can't lose! This stage will be a cinch!

587
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:05,870
{\i1}But if Noah's Ark is{\i}
{\i1}anticipating far ahead then...{\i}

588
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:09,400
Doc! I leave the rest to you!
I'm going to the scene!

589
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,740
Got it!

590
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:21,950
Sheesh. We're supposed to catch this guy?
Where do we even start?

591
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:24,850
I guess all we can do is wait until morning.

592
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:26,690
I'm cold...

593
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:27,690
Put this on.

594
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:30,350
- Oh! Are you sure?!
- Yeah.

595
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:33,900
I'm warm!

596
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:36,600
{\i1}Haibara-san!{\i} Here you are!

597
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:39,530
- Oh! Thank you!
- My pleasure!

598
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:40,970
Put this on!

599
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:42,770
But what about you?

600
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:45,310
I'm fine! I'm sensitive to heat!

601
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:46,640
Thanks!

602
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:54,120
Can you hear me {\i1}Conan-kun?{\i} It's me Agasa!

603
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,720
We hear you Doc!

604
00:43:55,720 --> 00:44:02,120
Listen closely! If you get hurt or
caught by the police in that stage

605
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:04,560
the game is over for you!

606
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:09,130
Right now you're in the
Whitechapel district on the East End.

607
00:44:09,130 --> 00:44:11,730
There's an assist character...

608
00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:12,900
...until...

609
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,400
What happened?

610
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,060
What happened Doc?! We can't hear you!

611
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:32,320
Grab on!

612
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,410
Conan! You can do it!

613
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,990
That was close!

614
00:44:47,470 --> 00:44:52,510
It seems you still don't understand.
The game is entirely in my control.

615
00:44:52,510 --> 00:44:55,440
There's no use in trying to outfox me.

616
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,450
I'll allow you to hear them though.

617
00:44:58,450 --> 00:45:02,780
Enjoy the sounds of the children's suffering!

618
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:05,780
What a screwed-up computer this is!

619
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:10,630
The doc's voice is gone now...

620
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:13,730
It seems Noah's Ark has cut
our line of communication.

621
00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:18,000
Then how do we find this assist character?!

622
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,040
That policeman told us just now!

623
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,040
He said "Contact Inspector Lestrade!"

624
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:27,210
Wait you mean the
Inspector Lestrade from that story?!

625
00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:31,650
But he was just a character in one
of Conan Doyle's mystery novels!

626
00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:36,380
This game might be a mix of reality and fiction.

627
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:38,820
Then is our assist character?

628
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:43,390
Yeah. He's gotta be here. Sherlock Holmes!

629
00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:44,060
Really?!

630
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:46,700
We're unstoppable with Holmes on our side!

631
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:49,200
This stage is as good as beat!

632
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:52,500
Let's hurry to Baker Street!

633
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,670
{\i1}That's it. If you can just meet with Holmes...{\i}

634
00:45:54,670 --> 00:46:00,340
{\i1}But it's quite a long way from{\i}
{\i1}Whitechapel to Baker Street...{\i}

635
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,850
Hey. Doesn't that clock seem weird?

636
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:22,700
It went backwards!

637
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:24,870
Oh! It did it again!

638
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:30,370
From 50 minutes to 49 minutes?
And then to 48?

639
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:34,440
I get it! That's the number of kids in the game!

640
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,380
It went back two minutes...

641
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:39,370
Which means two people in
another stage are out of the game...

642
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,800
Yasuhiro!

643
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:58,130
Two down in the Viking stage!

644
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:03,770
Tomoyuki!

645
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:04,930
M-Mineko!

646
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:08,910
Two more in the Colosseum stage!

647
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:13,750
{\i1}Faster! Lose the game faster!{\i}

648
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:19,910
{\i1}If the children discover who{\i}
{\i1}Jack the Ripper is I'm done for.{\i}

649
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:26,490
Three down in the Solomon stage!

650
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:28,490
That leaves 43...

651
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:35,700
Wait.

652
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:39,810
I hear there was another victim
in a back alley by Mitre Street.

653
00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:43,610
Two in one hour. That's four now.

654
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:46,350
The world's a horrible place...

655
00:47:46,350 --> 00:47:47,720
This is scary.

656
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:50,850
We came to a terrible time period.

657
00:47:50,850 --> 00:47:54,790
The turn of the century is said
to have been London's finest era

658
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:56,790
in the history of the British Empire

659
00:47:56,790 --> 00:48:00,000
but in actuality there was a
disparaging gap between rich and poor

660
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:05,730
crime was rampant and the
people's hearts were unruly.

661
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:08,900
Come to think of it
Shinichi told me about that.

662
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:11,970
He said if Sherlock Holmes
was the light of the era

663
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:14,810
Jack the Ripper was the dark shadow.

664
00:48:14,810 --> 00:48:17,980
Then let's hurry to the light of the era!

665
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:19,970
We're almost to Baker Street!

666
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:28,720
Beware Jack the Ripper...

667
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:33,830
He's waiting for you
on the streets at night...

668
00:48:33,830 --> 00:48:39,600
What should you do if
you don't want to die?

669
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:44,840
You need to get covered in blood too...

670
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,670
What could that mean?

671
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:49,940
Kill before being killed I'd say.

672
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:51,610
{\i1}Covered in blood?{\i}

673
00:48:58,690 --> 00:49:03,530
{\i1}There's a metal detector at the{\i}
{\i1}entrance to the presentation hall...{\i}

674
00:49:03,530 --> 00:49:06,860
{\i1}How did the killer bring the murder weapon in?{\i}

675
00:49:16,270 --> 00:49:19,910
It's nothin'. They're all cheap statues.

676
00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:20,940
Are you serious?

677
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:23,930
They'd never put anything that expensive here.

678
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:35,580
221-B. This is it.

679
00:49:39,130 --> 00:49:43,130
This is where the Sherlock Holmes lives?

680
00:49:43,130 --> 00:49:47,100
It's a lodging house he and Dr. Watson rent!

681
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:49,170
At this late hour? Who might you be?

682
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:55,110
U-Umm my name is Mori Ran.
We'd like to see {\i1}Holmes-san...{\i}

683
00:49:55,110 --> 00:49:58,810
{\i1}Holmes-san{\i} and Dr. Watson
are gone on a business trip.

684
00:49:58,810 --> 00:49:59,680
Business trip?

685
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:02,480
Yes. In a place called
Dartmoor out in the country.

686
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:05,020
I'm sorry to ask but what day is today?

687
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:07,320
September 30th.

688
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:11,930
September 30th? Dartmoor?

689
00:50:11,930 --> 00:50:15,030
Oh yeah! The Hound of the Baskervilles case!

690
00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:19,970
That's right! Neither of
them is in London right now!

691
00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:21,970
C'mon Doc...

692
00:50:21,970 --> 00:50:23,300
What's going on?!

693
00:50:24,870 --> 00:50:26,940
I'm sorry to ask but could I
see the surveillance footage

694
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:29,180
from before and after the incident?

695
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:30,510
Of course.

696
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:35,380
Yes?

697
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:36,990
What's wrong?

698
00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:40,320
It seems we underestimated Noah's Ark.

699
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:44,360
Neither Holmes nor Watson was on Baker Street.

700
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:47,300
So he did anticipate us...

701
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:51,970
There was also a strange accordion
player I don't remember creating.

702
00:50:51,970 --> 00:50:53,330
Things are becoming difficult.

703
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:57,970
Hey! What sort of story did
you come up with {\i1}Yusaku-kun?!{\i}

704
00:50:57,970 --> 00:51:01,080
The players work with Sherlock Holmes

705
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:04,710
to discover Jack the Ripper's identity.

706
00:51:04,710 --> 00:51:12,320
The murderer turns out to be an
aristocrat with a terminal illness.

707
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:15,390
I've prepared an even better ending for you!

708
00:51:15,390 --> 00:51:21,890
Damn you! Once the kids win
I'm throwing you into the garbage!

709
00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:27,160
{\i1}Good luck Shinichi.{\i}

710
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:34,670
Oh you're the ones who
helped {\i1}Holmes-san{\i} two weeks ago!

711
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:42,180
Come inside! I'll make you some warm milk tea!

712
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:47,560
She seems to think we're someone else.

713
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:52,860
Oh yeah! She thinks we're
the Baker Street Irregulars!

714
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:54,400
Who are they?

715
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:58,030
They're the street urchins Holmes hired!

716
00:51:58,030 --> 00:52:01,040
They were tough kids who'd
sneak into places adults couldn't go

717
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:03,040
and gather information for him!

718
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:07,280
Oh! So they're like the predecessors
of our Junior Detective League!

719
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,610
Pretty much!

720
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:12,540
Looks like they've managed to get inside.

721
00:52:17,890 --> 00:52:21,460
- Wow!
- It's just like on TV!

722
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:23,090
It's so moving!

723
00:52:23,090 --> 00:52:26,080
Shinichi will be so jealous
when he hears about this!

724
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:37,610
{\i1}He looks just like Shinichi...{\i}

725
00:52:37,610 --> 00:52:41,240
Oh my! You look just like {\i1}Holmes-san!{\i}

726
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:45,310
He's always sitting like that deep in thought!

727
00:52:45,310 --> 00:52:48,980
{\i1}Oh! He was just mimicking Holmes!{\i}

728
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:52,090
Please make yourselves at
home while I prepare the tea!

729
00:52:52,090 --> 00:52:53,750
Thank you!

730
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:59,190
Hey! Doesn't this look like someone?!

731
00:52:59,190 --> 00:53:03,030
Oh! It's Dr. Agasa but with hair!

732
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:05,520
This must be Holmes and Dr. Watson!

733
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:13,810
{\i1}Dad and the doc are totally playing around...{\i}

734
00:53:13,810 --> 00:53:17,310
Hey. We don't have time to sit around.

735
00:53:17,310 --> 00:53:20,520
But {\i1}Moroboshi-kun.{\i} What should we do?

736
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:24,290
I'm sure Glasses knows.

737
00:53:24,290 --> 00:53:29,190
Given how Holmes is he must
have a big file on Jack the Ripper.

738
00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:31,790
Then let's split up and look for it!

739
00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:35,900
Right! I'll look over here!

740
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:40,030
How're we supposed to find it?
This is all English...

741
00:53:40,030 --> 00:53:44,670
Let's see...
"Initial Investigation for Crime"...

742
00:53:44,670 --> 00:53:47,140
Whoa! I'm a genius!

743
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:48,910
I can read English!

744
00:53:48,910 --> 00:53:49,980
Me too!

745
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:53,850
It seems the players are
programmed to be able to read English.

746
00:53:53,850 --> 00:53:58,320
Bah. Then I wanna stay
inside the game forever...

747
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,250
Don't be stupid {\i1}Genta-kun!{\i}

748
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:04,060
At this rate we're going
to lose the game and die!

749
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:06,050
I-I'm just joking!

750
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:11,730
What a filthy ball...

751
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:17,570
l-Is this?!

752
00:54:17,570 --> 00:54:21,240
Hey! Emori! This is a 100 year-old soccer ball!

753
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:22,610
Oh! It is?!

754
00:54:22,610 --> 00:54:23,940
Eh?!

755
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:27,240
I found it! Is this it?!

756
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:33,290
"An Analysis of Jack the Ripper."

757
00:54:33,290 --> 00:54:38,090
The most recent previous
incident... was September 8th!

758
00:54:38,090 --> 00:54:43,460
"The second victim was
Honey Charleston age 41 single.

759
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:47,030
Her body was found in the barren
lot adjoining St. Mary's Church

760
00:54:47,030 --> 00:54:49,100
in the Whitechapel district.

761
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:53,310
Two rings of different sizes
were also found at the scene."

762
00:54:53,310 --> 00:54:55,640
{\i1}Rings of different sizes?{\i}

763
00:54:56,740 --> 00:55:00,250
"Given that Jack the Ripper
has terrorized London to its core

764
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:03,320
and brought about
unprecedented social anxiety

765
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:09,290
I am certain he is connected to
Professor Moriarty architect of evil."

766
00:55:09,290 --> 00:55:11,260
Professor Moriarty?!

767
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:13,900
Even he's in the game?!

768
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:15,600
So?! Who's he?!

769
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:19,000
Don't keep it to yourselves!

770
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,340
He's Holmes arch-nemesis.

771
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:24,070
They say he controls
London's criminal underworld

772
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:28,240
and wields great influence over all of Europe.

773
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,650
He's the Napoleon of the criminal world!

774
00:55:30,650 --> 00:55:34,080
But Professor Moriarty
usually only pulls the strings;

775
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:36,620
he almost never shows himself.

776
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:38,750
How are we supposed to find him?

777
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:44,360
If he won't show himself we'll
find someone connected to him...

778
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:46,260
...Colonel Sebastian Moran!

779
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:50,260
Oh yeah! Colonel Moran
the professor's right-hand man!

780
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:53,630
But how do we find the colonel?

781
00:55:53,630 --> 00:55:55,100
I'm sure that's...

782
00:55:55,100 --> 00:56:01,110
According to Holmes notes his
base is the Trump Club downtown.

783
00:56:01,110 --> 00:56:03,280
He's the second most
dangerous person in London

784
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,280
so we need to be careful meeting him!

785
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:08,650
{\i1}Conan-kun{\i} how do you know so much?

786
00:56:08,650 --> 00:56:12,290
Oh uhh {\i1}Shinichi-niichan{\i} was
always talking about this stuff!

787
00:56:12,290 --> 00:56:15,390
Oh! I should've guessed!

788
00:56:15,390 --> 00:56:20,730
But that mystery nerd's blabbing
actually turned out to be useful here!

789
00:56:20,730 --> 00:56:23,060
{\i1}You don't have to call it "blabbing..."{\i}

790
00:56:24,830 --> 00:56:27,670
Whoa! A real gun!

791
00:56:27,670 --> 00:56:29,470
Put it back Genta!

792
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:33,240
B-But we're meeting a scary guy right?

793
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:35,580
Weapons you don't know how to use are useless

794
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:36,740
and only cause trouble!

795
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:37,980
Leave it!

796
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:39,640
Y-You're scarier...

797
00:56:45,690 --> 00:56:48,350
Alright! Let's go before it gets too late!

798
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:04,170
Hey! Moroboshi!

799
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:06,830
Gotta be able to protect myself.

800
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:19,450
30 people left...

801
00:57:19,450 --> 00:57:21,520
It's gone down a lot...

802
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:25,360
I would guess members of our
group will soon be falling out too.

803
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:27,350
Don't say unlucky stuff like that!

804
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:38,270
Toru!

805
00:57:39,410 --> 00:57:40,370
Emi!

806
00:57:40,370 --> 00:57:41,710
Takuya!

807
00:57:47,450 --> 00:57:49,780
Okay. Wait here everyone.

808
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:52,390
I'm going to check things
out from the back door.

809
00:57:52,390 --> 00:57:54,380
- Be careful!
- Yeah.

810
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:15,410
One card.

811
00:58:16,510 --> 00:58:18,080
I'll take two.

812
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:19,740
{\i1}It's Colonel Moran!{\i}

813
00:58:21,850 --> 00:58:23,510
{\i1}That monkey!{\i}

814
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:32,430
Well Glasses?

815
00:58:32,430 --> 00:58:33,930
W-What are you doing here?!

816
00:58:33,930 --> 00:58:37,090
We can't let you hog all the credit!

817
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:42,340
Straight!

818
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:43,970
So sorry.

819
00:58:43,970 --> 00:58:45,470
Flush.

820
00:58:45,470 --> 00:58:48,780
- What?!
- Tonight's my lucky night!

821
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:50,440
Damn it!

822
00:58:51,650 --> 00:58:54,180
Moran's awesome at poker...

823
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:55,450
He's cheating.

824
00:58:55,450 --> 00:58:57,850
- What?!
- You can tell?!

825
00:58:57,850 --> 00:59:02,290
That monkey is telling the colonel
what hand the other guy has.

826
00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:03,290
It's been trained:

827
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:06,630
The right hand for hearts and spades
the left for diamonds and clubs.

828
00:59:06,630 --> 00:59:10,800
And then it eats the number
and color indicated on the cards.

829
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:15,670
The 3 of Spades would be three
black berries with the right hand.

830
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:17,570
That's cheap.

831
00:59:17,570 --> 00:59:21,210
{\i1}Huh? What's with that seat?{\i}

832
00:59:21,210 --> 00:59:22,680
{\i1}And why is that there?{\i}

833
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:24,010
Cheater!

834
00:59:26,850 --> 00:59:30,520
This Moran creep is a cheater!

835
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:34,590
You'd best watch your mouth boy!

836
00:59:34,590 --> 00:59:37,390
Or do you have proof I'm cheating?!

837
00:59:37,390 --> 00:59:38,590
Of course!

838
00:59:38,590 --> 00:59:42,900
You're good friends with
that monkey aren't you?

839
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:44,430
What?!

840
00:59:44,430 --> 00:59:46,930
It looked at his cards and
when it was a 3 of Spades

841
00:59:46,930 --> 00:59:49,170
it ate three black berries with its right hand

842
00:59:49,170 --> 00:59:52,910
and for the 5 of Diamonds
it ate five red berries with the left.

843
00:59:52,910 --> 00:59:55,540
Moran! You cheated me!

844
00:59:55,540 --> 00:59:57,510
It's your fault for falling for it.

845
00:59:57,510 --> 00:59:58,950
What?!

846
00:59:58,950 --> 01:00:00,450
Whoops.

847
01:00:00,450 --> 01:00:03,280
You can save your squabble for later.

848
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:06,090
Where is Professor Moriarty?

849
01:00:06,090 --> 01:00:09,090
Boy! Where did you hear his name?!

850
01:00:09,090 --> 01:00:10,420
Stop!

851
01:00:12,690 --> 01:00:14,680
Catch those brats!

852
01:00:25,270 --> 01:00:27,540
You damn kid!

853
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:29,580
Are you all right {\i1}Conan-kun?!{\i}

854
01:00:29,580 --> 01:00:30,380
Yeah...

855
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:32,370
We're here to help Conan!

856
01:00:41,390 --> 01:00:42,920
Bottom's up!

857
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:46,930
This is bad! We're all in here!

858
01:00:46,930 --> 01:00:48,920
Look out {\i1}Conan-kun!{\i}

859
01:00:52,830 --> 01:00:54,770
{\i1}Kikukawa-kun!{\i}

860
01:00:54,770 --> 01:00:56,800
Hey! Hang in there!

861
01:00:56,800 --> 01:01:00,570
They got me. Now you and I are even.

862
01:01:00,570 --> 01:01:01,910
Hey!

863
01:01:08,150 --> 01:01:09,480
Kikukawa...

864
01:01:14,690 --> 01:01:16,020
Seiichiro!

865
01:01:21,630 --> 01:01:24,000
{\i1}Ayumi-chan!{\i} Are you all right?!

866
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,870
Thank you {\i1}Mitsuhiko-kun!{\i}

867
01:01:25,870 --> 01:01:27,200
It was nothing!

868
01:01:32,170 --> 01:01:33,500
{\i1}M-Mitsuhiko-kun!{\i}

869
01:01:35,010 --> 01:01:39,450
{\i1}Ayumi-chan{\i} it appears we're out of the game.

870
01:01:39,450 --> 01:01:43,680
{\i1}Conan-kun!{\i} Make sure you
bring us back to life okay?!

871
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:45,680
Ayumi! Mitsuhiko!

872
01:01:57,360 --> 01:02:00,360
{\i1}Not good! At this rate we're{\i}
{\i1}all going to get a "game over"!{\i}

873
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:05,640
"S.H."

874
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:07,300
Sherlock Holmes!

875
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:11,470
Conan! Look out!

876
01:02:13,650 --> 01:02:14,980
Genta!

877
01:02:18,750 --> 01:02:20,750
Game over huh...

878
01:02:20,750 --> 01:02:25,250
Conan make sure you
catch Jack the Ripper okay?

879
01:02:33,330 --> 01:02:35,670
Playtime is over!

880
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:39,170
I was going to capture you
and find out who you work for

881
01:02:39,170 --> 01:02:41,710
but that doesn't seem to be necessary anymore!

882
01:02:41,710 --> 01:02:44,080
Because this gun belongs to Holmes!

883
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:48,740
{\i1}Damn! Now what?! What do we do?!{\i}

884
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:52,720
{\i1}The thing that man is holding... It's...{\i}

885
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:55,120
{\i1}...the wine that was at that seat!{\i}

886
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:58,290
{\i1}Now I see! That's what it was for!{\i}

887
01:02:58,290 --> 01:03:00,620
Now who goes first?

888
01:03:04,730 --> 01:03:06,730
Boy!

889
01:03:06,730 --> 01:03:08,870
Shoot me and the wine bottle breaks!

890
01:03:08,870 --> 01:03:11,710
Hmph! What's that supposed to mean?!

891
01:03:11,710 --> 01:03:15,080
The empty seat at the card table!

892
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:17,540
The specially-decorated chair

893
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:21,280
and the glass and wine set
out for a certain visitor...

894
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:24,720
Using that as a hint
I can deduce that said visitor

895
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:28,920
can only be Professor Moriarty!

896
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:32,390
So sorry but your deduction is wrong!

897
01:03:32,390 --> 01:03:33,960
Then shoot!

898
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:37,500
If you don't care if the professor's
wine bottle shatters that is.

899
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:38,830
{\i1}B-Boy...{\i}

900
01:03:45,110 --> 01:03:46,770
{\i1}Conan-kun...{\i}

901
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:09,130
{\i1}Moriarty-sama{\i} says he wishes to see you.

902
01:04:09,130 --> 01:04:10,970
Professor Moriarty does?!

903
01:04:10,970 --> 01:04:15,100
He waits in his carriage. Please follow me.

904
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:16,590
P-Please wait!

905
01:04:18,870 --> 01:04:22,040
Do you intend to defy {\i1}Moriarty-sama?{\i}

906
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:37,890
I have brought them sir.

907
01:04:37,890 --> 01:04:39,390
Well done.

908
01:04:39,390 --> 01:04:42,530
Now then boy. May I have that wine?

909
01:04:42,530 --> 01:04:43,860
Here.

910
01:04:46,070 --> 01:04:47,730
{\i1}This scent...{\i}

911
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:49,400
You are indeed Holmes pupils

912
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:53,210
if you're able to fight on
even terms with Colonel Moran.

913
01:04:53,210 --> 01:04:56,210
So you have business with me?

914
01:04:56,210 --> 01:04:59,810
Say mister. You're Professor Moriarty?

915
01:04:59,810 --> 01:05:01,380
None other.

916
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:05,820
Oh I see. You're testing us.

917
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:08,360
What do you mean?

918
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:12,860
You can drop the act!
You're not Professor Moriarty mister!

919
01:05:12,860 --> 01:05:15,900
W-What are you saying {\i1}Conan-kun?!{\i}

920
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:19,560
After all the real
Professor Moriarty is right here!

921
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,840
- Eh?! He is?!
- Are you serious?!

922
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:28,170
You used ventriloquism to
speak for him didn't you?

923
01:05:31,850 --> 01:05:36,420
To think you saw through all
of that... How could you tell?

924
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:40,790
Just now Colonel Moran said
"Please wait!" to you.

925
01:05:40,790 --> 01:05:46,060
Oh right! Colonel Moran only
speaks politely to Professor Moriarty!

926
01:05:46,060 --> 01:05:47,760
Y-Yeah!

927
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:49,460
Is that all?

928
01:05:49,460 --> 01:05:54,470
One other thing. I heard Professor
Moriarty was a fanciful old man

929
01:05:54,470 --> 01:05:56,640
who uses natural herbal cologne!

930
01:05:56,640 --> 01:06:01,410
Oh? And you smelled that
when you gave him the wine?

931
01:06:01,410 --> 01:06:05,400
Marvelously done. It's almost as
if I'm looking at a mini-Holmes.

932
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:11,120
Incidentally what business
do you have with me?

933
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:14,120
You unleashed Jack the Ripper on the city

934
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:18,060
to change London into a town of terror right?

935
01:06:18,060 --> 01:06:20,560
That's not too far off the mark.

936
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:25,730
Jack the Ripper was a vagabond boy
I found in the poor part of town.

937
01:06:25,730 --> 01:06:30,100
Abandoned by his mother
he wandered the streets...

938
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:33,270
But I realized his talent the
moment I laid eyes on him.

939
01:06:33,270 --> 01:06:35,940
His talent as a criminal that is.

940
01:06:38,150 --> 01:06:42,420
I raised him to be a
first-class professional killer.

941
01:06:42,420 --> 01:06:46,490
Why is he murdering innocent women?!

942
01:06:46,490 --> 01:06:49,760
Jack the Ripper became
more of a homicidal maniac

943
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,930
than I had ever imagined.

944
01:06:51,930 --> 01:06:56,330
This string of murders is his own crazed doing.

945
01:06:56,330 --> 01:07:03,470
If you're trying to get rid of
Jack the Ripper I'll lend you my help.

946
01:07:03,470 --> 01:07:04,940
Help?!

947
01:07:04,940 --> 01:07:08,780
Jack the Ripper has indeed begun to run wild

948
01:07:08,780 --> 01:07:13,050
but he should still obey
my instructions to murder.

949
01:07:13,050 --> 01:07:16,180
You simply need to beat him to his target.

950
01:07:16,180 --> 01:07:17,720
How?!

951
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:22,990
I will place a message for him in
the ads of tomorrow's Sunday Times.

952
01:07:22,990 --> 01:07:24,960
Who are you going to order him to kill?!

953
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:27,620
You will find out in tomorrow's paper.

954
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,670
Hey! Can we trust this old man?!

955
01:07:37,670 --> 01:07:39,660
Let's give it a shot.

956
01:07:40,970 --> 01:07:42,810
I pray for your luck.

957
01:07:42,810 --> 01:07:45,970
Be careful at the Reichenbach
Falls three years from now!

958
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:05,570
What's "Reichenbach"?

959
01:08:05,570 --> 01:08:08,570
Three years from now
Professor Moriarty and Holmes fight

960
01:08:08,570 --> 01:08:12,240
at the Reichenbach waterfall in Switzerland.

961
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:14,780
They both fall to the bottom.

962
01:08:14,780 --> 01:08:18,050
Holmes miraculously survives

963
01:08:18,050 --> 01:08:21,380
but Professor Moriarty supposedly dies.

964
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:25,550
Why did I warn him like that?

965
01:08:25,550 --> 01:08:29,890
I guess maybe I like that
villain as much as Holmes does!

966
01:08:33,730 --> 01:08:35,720
{\i1}That reminds me of that time...{\i}

967
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:40,270
I'm pretty fond of Professor Moriarty myself!

968
01:08:40,270 --> 01:08:43,940
Well as a fictional character anyway.

969
01:08:43,940 --> 01:08:48,210
Their confrontation at
Holmes house was mind-blowing!

970
01:08:48,210 --> 01:08:52,450
I just love one of the things Holmes said then!

971
01:08:52,450 --> 01:08:54,210
Can you guess what it is?

972
01:08:54,210 --> 01:08:55,650
No.

973
01:08:55,650 --> 01:08:57,310
It was...

974
01:09:04,060 --> 01:09:08,060
{\i1}What did Shinichi say?{\i}

975
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:13,230
{\i1}We were on a date but he{\i}
{\i1}kept talking about Holmes{\i}

976
01:09:13,230 --> 01:09:14,890
{\i1}so I tuned him out...{\i}

977
01:09:16,900 --> 01:09:18,340
Hey {\i1}Conan-kun.{\i}

978
01:09:18,340 --> 01:09:20,110
Yeah?

979
01:09:20,110 --> 01:09:22,100
No. Never mind!

980
01:09:24,310 --> 01:09:29,680
{\i1}I'm so dumb. Of course Conan-kun wouldn't know.{\i}

981
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:32,650
H-Hey Glasses.

982
01:09:32,650 --> 01:09:39,090
Sorry. It's our fault that four
people got a "game over..."

983
01:09:39,090 --> 01:09:42,460
There's no point in worrying about what's done.

984
01:09:42,460 --> 01:09:47,300
I'd say the fact you've started to
think that way is a good step forward.

985
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:52,300
Yes! Let's work hard to figure out
what to do next for everyone!

986
01:10:08,860 --> 01:10:13,520
{\i1}So this is where the second victim{\i}
{\i1}Honey Charleston was found...{\i}

987
01:10:31,750 --> 01:10:33,750
{\i1}"The parent-child bazaar will be held again{\i}

988
01:10:33,750 --> 01:10:36,480
{\i1}on the second Saturday in October."{\i}

989
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:41,980
{\i1}The second Saturday? As I recall{\i}
{\i1}Honey Charleston was killed...{\i}

990
01:10:44,190 --> 01:10:46,180
{\i1}...Saturday September 8th!{\i}

991
01:10:53,070 --> 01:10:54,170
Sorry I made you wait!

992
01:10:54,170 --> 01:10:56,940
What took so long? Where were you?!

993
01:10:56,940 --> 01:10:59,210
Just exploring the city!

994
01:10:59,210 --> 01:11:02,510
You sure are carefree on
the day of our showdown.

995
01:11:02,510 --> 01:11:05,580
Jack the Ripper has struck again!

996
01:11:05,580 --> 01:11:07,950
There were two victims this time!

997
01:11:07,950 --> 01:11:09,280
I'll take a paper!

998
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:10,920
Sure thing!

999
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:13,720
Oh no! I don't have English money!

1000
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:16,220
Here you are! 80 yen!

1001
01:11:16,220 --> 01:11:18,210
Oh. How convenient!

1002
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:23,730
Here it is!

1003
01:11:23,730 --> 01:11:29,370
"Clean the opera house tonight. From M to J."

1004
01:11:29,370 --> 01:11:31,040
"From M to J..."

1005
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:33,540
"From Moriarty to Jack the Ripper."

1006
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:37,110
Clean the opera house? Is that his instruction?

1007
01:11:37,110 --> 01:11:40,440
It could mean "Murder an
actor who appears on stage..."

1008
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:43,480
Here it is!

1009
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:44,920
"The Triumphant Performance Returns!

1010
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:48,790
Prima Donna in the Imperial
Opera of Warsaw... Irene Adler!"

1011
01:11:48,790 --> 01:11:53,260
{\i1}Professor Moriarty!{\i}
{\i1}You're the most despicable of villains!{\i}

1012
01:11:53,260 --> 01:11:56,130
Who's Irene Adler?

1013
01:11:56,130 --> 01:12:00,230
It's said she's the only
woman Holmes ever loved!

1014
01:12:00,230 --> 01:12:03,730
Which means he made
Holmes beloved the murder target.

1015
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:15,920
12:06 a. M!

1016
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:19,250
- That means...
...all the other stages failed.

1017
01:12:19,250 --> 01:12:22,920
Which means everyone's
lives are in the hands of us six!

1018
01:12:41,370 --> 01:12:42,680
Hold it!

1019
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:46,450
This area is for authorized persons only!

1020
01:12:46,450 --> 01:12:50,280
W-We're acquaintances of Irene {\i1}Adler-san!{\i}

1021
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:52,120
We wanted to offer our
encouragement before she goes on!

1022
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:54,620
Oh! You know her?

1023
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:57,190
Yes! Where is her waiting room?

1024
01:12:57,190 --> 01:13:00,520
In that case it's the room at
the very end with the poster.

1025
01:13:02,230 --> 01:13:06,870
This must be it. I wonder
what she's like. I'm so excited!

1026
01:13:06,870 --> 01:13:11,860
{\i1}Given that my dad made her{\i}
{\i1}character and that she's Holmes love...{\i}

1027
01:13:13,410 --> 01:13:14,740
Come in!

1028
01:13:15,710 --> 01:13:17,370
Pardon the intrusion!

1029
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:23,980
Shinichi's mom!

1030
01:13:23,980 --> 01:13:25,550
{\i1}I knew it.{\i}

1031
01:13:25,550 --> 01:13:29,220
How rude! I'm still single!

1032
01:13:29,220 --> 01:13:33,430
Well to be more precise
I'm single now that I've divorced!

1033
01:13:33,430 --> 01:13:35,500
A bouquet from {\i1}Holmes-san!{\i}

1034
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:37,730
Oh! Thank you!

1035
01:13:37,730 --> 01:13:39,700
Where might {\i1}Holmes-san{\i} be?

1036
01:13:39,700 --> 01:13:42,440
He was looking forward
to tonight's performance

1037
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:44,870
but he had to leave on a case and can't come...

1038
01:13:44,870 --> 01:13:47,340
Oh. That's too bad.

1039
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:49,340
Please call tonight's show off!

1040
01:13:49,340 --> 01:13:50,510
Eh?

1041
01:13:50,510 --> 01:13:53,110
{\i1}Holmes-san's{\i} arch-nemesis Professor Moriarty

1042
01:13:53,110 --> 01:13:55,520
has sent someone to kill you!

1043
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:57,450
Why me?

1044
01:13:57,450 --> 01:14:02,360
Because he wants to see
{\i1}Holmes-san's{\i} sadness when he loses you!

1045
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:08,400
I'd like to see it too! I wonder
how sad he would be for me...

1046
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:13,200
You don't care about being
Jack the Ripper's fifth victim?!

1047
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:17,190
You're going to protect me right?
In {\i1}Holmes-san's{\i} place?

1048
01:14:19,770 --> 01:14:22,940
Nothing scares this lady...

1049
01:14:22,940 --> 01:14:26,280
{\i1}Yeah. This is exactly how she is...{\i}

1050
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:56,570
Die beautifully Irene Adler...

1051
01:14:59,750 --> 01:15:02,410
{\i1}Where is he lurking?{\i}

1052
01:15:12,090 --> 01:15:14,080
- What the...?!
- What's happening?!

1053
01:15:17,930 --> 01:15:19,590
Look out!

1054
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:25,300
- Emori!
- {\i1}Takizawa-kun!{\i}

1055
01:15:27,510 --> 01:15:31,540
- Emori! You're...!
- You too {\i1}Takizawa-kun!{\i}

1056
01:15:31,540 --> 01:15:33,210
Game over huh...

1057
01:15:33,210 --> 01:15:35,520
This sucks...

1058
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:38,180
Thank you. You saved my life!

1059
01:15:41,020 --> 01:15:43,820
This is the first time
anyone's ever thanked me...

1060
01:15:43,820 --> 01:15:46,230
l-It feels nice!

1061
01:15:46,230 --> 01:15:48,560
Moroboshi! I leave the rest to you now!

1062
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:50,550
You can count on me!

1063
01:16:00,810 --> 01:16:02,800
- A-Akira!
- Shinya!

1064
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:08,540
That leaves only four
including {\i1}Ran-kun{\i} and {\i1}Conan-kun...{\i}

1065
01:16:22,230 --> 01:16:27,720
That's it Jack the Ripper!
Turn this world into Hell!

1066
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:34,840
Hurry! Out the back!

1067
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:36,610
Hurry Haibara! That way!

1068
01:16:36,610 --> 01:16:38,600
Conan! Look out!

1069
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:47,520
Haibara! Are you okay?!

1070
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:51,020
You can't give up {\i1}Kudo-kun!{\i}

1071
01:16:51,020 --> 01:16:56,600
If there aren't any assist characters
then you're our Holmes...

1072
01:16:56,600 --> 01:16:59,630
You're skilled enough for that.

1073
01:16:59,630 --> 01:17:03,630
There's no case Holmes can't solve right?

1074
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:16,300
{\i1}Ai-kun...{\i}

1075
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:20,420
Quickly! Quickly! Evacuate!

1076
01:17:24,660 --> 01:17:26,320
Stay behind me!

1077
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:39,610
- Stop!
- Bye! You're safe with police around!

1078
01:17:39,610 --> 01:17:42,740
Little boy! I still don't know your name!

1079
01:17:42,740 --> 01:17:44,910
I'm Edogawa Conan!

1080
01:17:44,910 --> 01:17:47,680
I have the same name as your guys birth father!

1081
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:49,340
Conan?

1082
01:17:55,660 --> 01:17:57,650
{\i1}I won't let him get away!{\i}

1083
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:01,260
How are things going?

1084
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:04,600
{\i1}Conan-kun's{\i} group encountered Jack the Ripper.

1085
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:07,530
They're chasing him right now.

1086
01:18:07,530 --> 01:18:09,370
Charing Cross Station!

1087
01:18:27,820 --> 01:18:29,810
{\i1}Conan-kun!{\i} Get on first!

1088
01:18:34,630 --> 01:18:37,060
This is the worst possible scenario!

1089
01:18:37,060 --> 01:18:39,400
How so?

1090
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:42,870
The last train out of Charing Cross Station...

1091
01:18:42,870 --> 01:18:44,860
It's the most dangerous climax of all!

1092
01:19:01,190 --> 01:19:06,390
Eh?! Jack the Ripper is
disguised as a passenger?!

1093
01:19:06,390 --> 01:19:08,830
Please gather all the
passengers onto a single car!

1094
01:19:08,830 --> 01:19:10,160
R-Right!

1095
01:19:18,770 --> 01:19:20,430
Mr. Conductor! Could you...

1096
01:19:22,510 --> 01:19:25,510
Okay everyone! Please raise both hands!

1097
01:19:25,510 --> 01:19:29,170
I want to make sure no
one is carrying a weapon.

1098
01:19:36,090 --> 01:19:39,750
{\i1}I look forward to hearing you figure this out...{\i}

1099
01:19:40,530 --> 01:19:45,800
I'll now explain what was
written in Mr. Holmes notes.

1100
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:51,100
Honey Charleston the second
victim of Jack the Ripper

1101
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:55,540
was married in the town of Windsor
but as she was full of dreams

1102
01:19:55,540 --> 01:20:00,080
she abandoned her husband and son
10 years ago to come to London.

1103
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:04,780
These two rings were at the scene
of Honey Charleston's murder.

1104
01:20:04,780 --> 01:20:06,250
One is Honey's.

1105
01:20:06,250 --> 01:20:11,490
The other has the same design
but didn't fit any of Honey's fingers.

1106
01:20:11,490 --> 01:20:14,930
So Mr. Holmes believes the following.

1107
01:20:14,930 --> 01:20:18,930
He thinks these two rings may
have signified the parent-child bond

1108
01:20:18,930 --> 01:20:22,340
between the victim
Honey Charleston and Jack the Ripper.

1109
01:20:22,340 --> 01:20:26,310
Meaning that little ring is Jack the Ripper's?!

1110
01:20:26,310 --> 01:20:27,570
Yes.

1111
01:20:27,570 --> 01:20:31,740
She put a ring of the same design
on her son's finger before leaving.

1112
01:20:31,740 --> 01:20:35,950
Does that mean Jack the Ripper
murdered his own mother?

1113
01:20:35,950 --> 01:20:39,950
Yeah. According to his notes
the day she was murdered Sept. 8

1114
01:20:39,950 --> 01:20:41,960
was the second Saturday of September

1115
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:45,960
the day of the monthly bazaar
at the Whitechapel church

1116
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:51,200
in which parents and children
bring things they made together!

1117
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:54,670
And he thinks Jack the Ripper knew that!

1118
01:20:54,670 --> 01:20:58,140
Eh? He even wrote that down?

1119
01:20:58,140 --> 01:21:04,540
In other words Jack the Ripper
wanted to participate with his mother

1120
01:21:04,540 --> 01:21:06,780
so he left their two rings?

1121
01:21:06,780 --> 01:21:09,450
Yeah! Apparently!

1122
01:21:09,450 --> 01:21:14,440
Then his motive was his grudge
for his mother abandoning him...

1123
01:21:15,790 --> 01:21:19,450
What did I do?! I'm not the only one drunk!

1124
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:27,460
But his bloodlust was almost out of love...

1125
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:32,370
How sad...

1126
01:21:32,370 --> 01:21:35,910
Apparently he chose an unrelated
woman for his first victim

1127
01:21:35,910 --> 01:21:38,810
to throw the police off.

1128
01:21:38,810 --> 01:21:42,150
But what about the third and fourth victims?

1129
01:21:42,150 --> 01:21:44,880
Professor Moriarty's special education

1130
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:49,260
molded Jack the Ripper
into a psychotic criminal

1131
01:21:49,260 --> 01:21:51,660
so even after clearing his
grudge with his mother

1132
01:21:51,660 --> 01:21:56,620
he couldn't help but continue
targeting women like her.

1133
01:21:56,900 --> 01:21:58,830
Who is it then?!

1134
01:21:58,830 --> 01:22:03,840
If he kept the ring on since childhood

1135
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:06,840
what do you think would happen to his finger?

1136
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:11,170
Out of his 10 fingers that
one finger should be thin!

1137
01:22:14,850 --> 01:22:17,840
Jack the Ripper is you!

1138
01:22:20,950 --> 01:22:22,940
But that's a woman!

1139
01:22:26,260 --> 01:22:28,250
Her right ring finger is thin!

1140
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:38,590
- I got this!
- No! {\i1}Ran-neechan!{\i}

1141
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:42,710
Damn! A smokescreen!

1142
01:22:42,710 --> 01:22:44,700
- Open the window!
- Yeah!

1143
01:22:52,620 --> 01:22:53,950
T-They're gone!

1144
01:22:53,950 --> 01:22:55,610
H-Hey!

1145
01:22:58,060 --> 01:23:01,390
{\i1}All the passengers have{\i}
{\i1}disappeared! What's going on?!{\i}

1146
01:23:06,430 --> 01:23:11,670
Now then. Let us identify
who Kashimura's killer was too.

1147
01:23:11,670 --> 01:23:14,770
Eh?! You know who did it?!

1148
01:23:14,770 --> 01:23:19,910
The issue is how the killer
prepared the murder weapon.

1149
01:23:19,910 --> 01:23:25,350
A metal detector is installed at
the entrance to the Beika City Hall.

1150
01:23:25,350 --> 01:23:32,130
So it's mostly likely that the weapon
was already inside the building.

1151
01:23:32,130 --> 01:23:35,330
But where could someone get that?!

1152
01:23:35,330 --> 01:23:38,660
The bronze statues in the party hall.

1153
01:23:38,660 --> 01:23:41,330
One of them is holding a dagger.

1154
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:46,540
The party hall was filled with guests!

1155
01:23:46,540 --> 01:23:49,440
Someone would've seen the killer taking it!

1156
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:56,350
It was removed when the lights went out.
It had all been scheduled.

1157
01:23:56,350 --> 01:24:01,120
But wouldn't someone have
noticed the dagger was missing?!

1158
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:06,960
A fake was left in its place.
Made of cardboard and foil or something.

1159
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:10,000
Then is the dagger the statue's holding now

1160
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,300
the one used in the murder?!

1161
01:24:12,300 --> 01:24:18,640
Yes. I just had a luminol test and
fingerprint check done on the dagger.

1162
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:22,410
Blood the same type as Kashimura's was found.

1163
01:24:22,410 --> 01:24:26,550
Fingerprints were also found on the handle.

1164
01:24:26,550 --> 01:24:31,980
Your fingerprints President Schindler.

1165
01:24:31,980 --> 01:24:37,190
Of course they were. The bronze
statues were brought from my home.

1166
01:24:37,190 --> 01:24:40,190
This is surveillance footage of the party hall

1167
01:24:40,190 --> 01:24:43,560
from before and after the incident.

1168
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:48,170
Luckily surveillance cameras
are placed all around the hall

1169
01:24:48,170 --> 01:24:52,000
so I could record from every angle.

1170
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,070
The ball that young Moroboshi
kicks hits the bronze statue

1171
01:24:55,070 --> 01:24:58,040
and knocks the dagger off.

1172
01:24:58,040 --> 01:25:02,550
He picks it up and returns
it to the statue's hand.

1173
01:25:02,550 --> 01:25:06,050
I see! If the dagger shown here is the real one

1174
01:25:06,050 --> 01:25:09,020
the boy's fingerprints should be on it too!

1175
01:25:09,020 --> 01:25:14,090
But only President Schindler's
fingerprints were found!

1176
01:25:14,090 --> 01:25:19,130
I simply touched it after the boy
so his fingerprints are gone.

1177
01:25:19,130 --> 01:25:22,200
{\i1}Kudo-sensei!{\i} I found it!

1178
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:24,640
There was a fake dagger
made of cardboard and foil

1179
01:25:24,640 --> 01:25:26,140
in the basement garbage collection!

1180
01:25:26,140 --> 01:25:27,810
Any fingerprints?!

1181
01:25:27,810 --> 01:25:30,040
It's just like you said {\i1}Kudo-sensei!{\i}

1182
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:36,080
It has young Moroboshi's and
President Schindler's fingerprints!

1183
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:41,050
The only fingerprints that can be
on the fake dagger besides the boy's

1184
01:25:41,050 --> 01:25:43,090
are the killer's.

1185
01:25:43,090 --> 01:25:47,130
This is a set-up! I'm issuing a
protest to the Japanese government!

1186
01:25:47,130 --> 01:25:50,460
Besides I have no reason to
murder Kashimura in the first place!

1187
01:25:54,430 --> 01:25:57,430
They're not here! All that's
up ahead is the engine room!

1188
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:06,680
The driver is gone!

1189
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:09,010
- We gotta stop the train!
- Yeah!

1190
01:26:11,250 --> 01:26:13,240
The brake's been destroyed!

1191
01:26:22,630 --> 01:26:24,300
We're speeding up!

1192
01:26:24,300 --> 01:26:27,830
Hey! Shouldn't we find that girl?!

1193
01:26:27,830 --> 01:26:31,140
{\i1}Ran! Where are you?! Where did you go?!{\i}

1194
01:26:31,140 --> 01:26:32,800
{\i1}Wait!{\i}

1195
01:26:34,340 --> 01:26:36,330
There they are!

1196
01:26:43,620 --> 01:26:45,180
{\i1}Ran-neechan!{\i}

1197
01:26:45,180 --> 01:26:47,180
No! Stay away!

1198
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:52,330
I've tied myself to this girl.

1199
01:26:52,330 --> 01:26:56,130
If I fall she comes with me!

1200
01:26:56,130 --> 01:26:58,660
So how will you fight?!

1201
01:26:58,660 --> 01:27:00,330
Dammit!

1202
01:27:01,470 --> 01:27:04,470
I hear the statue's dagger
has been passed down

1203
01:27:04,470 --> 01:27:08,540
from generation to generation in
the same Schindler family bloodline.

1204
01:27:08,540 --> 01:27:11,240
Indeed it has.

1205
01:27:11,240 --> 01:27:15,410
Why did you use it as the murder weapon?

1206
01:27:15,410 --> 01:27:21,410
Assuming you didn't have to
use it as the murder weapon...

1207
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:28,360
What is it you want Jack the Ripper?!

1208
01:27:28,360 --> 01:27:30,160
"Want"?!

1209
01:27:30,160 --> 01:27:33,370
Now that you've killed your mother
and cleared your long grudge

1210
01:27:33,370 --> 01:27:35,170
what is it you want?!

1211
01:27:35,170 --> 01:27:37,170
To continue living!

1212
01:27:37,170 --> 01:27:40,170
I'm going to let the vicious
blood flowing through my veins

1213
01:27:40,170 --> 01:27:43,840
survive to the next
generation aboard Noah's boat!

1214
01:27:47,350 --> 01:27:50,010
I take it this is your motive
for murdering Kashimura.

1215
01:27:52,220 --> 01:27:57,390
Almost as if he had been aboard
Noah's ark Jack the Ripper's blood

1216
01:27:57,390 --> 01:28:00,730
survived to the present day.

1217
01:28:00,730 --> 01:28:04,560
You're Jack the Ripper's descendant.

1218
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:08,200
- J-Jack the Ripper's...
...descendant?!

1219
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:13,040
{\i1}Hiroki-kun{\i} most likely learned
this using his DNA Search Program.

1220
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:17,040
If the world learned that the czar
of the IT industry is the descendant

1221
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:21,980
of the psychotic serial murderer
from 100 years ago he'd be done for.

1222
01:28:21,980 --> 01:28:25,890
So to keep things quiet
you drove {\i1}Hiroki-kun{\i} to suicide...

1223
01:28:25,890 --> 01:28:29,890
...and murdered Kashimura!

1224
01:28:29,890 --> 01:28:34,880
It was when Hiroki came to see my collection.

1225
01:28:36,630 --> 01:28:41,400
This is a gold wine cup used
by the Egyptian king Khufu.

1226
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:44,240
Next is Ganjin Wajo's scriptures

1227
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:48,810
and the manuscript of Edogawa
Rampo's "The Psychological Test."

1228
01:28:48,810 --> 01:28:50,140
Amazing!

1229
01:28:51,980 --> 01:28:54,450
What about this dagger?

1230
01:28:54,450 --> 01:28:57,780
Oh uhh...

1231
01:28:57,780 --> 01:29:00,790
It's supposedly the weapon
used by Jack the Ripper

1232
01:29:00,790 --> 01:29:03,420
a deranged serial killer from a century ago...

1233
01:29:03,420 --> 01:29:06,410
There's no telling if it really is though.

1234
01:29:10,460 --> 01:29:16,040
For an experiment Hiroki gathered
all the data around him he could

1235
01:29:16,040 --> 01:29:18,670
and entered it into the computer.

1236
01:29:18,670 --> 01:29:22,980
And the DNA of Honey Charleston
taken from the dagger

1237
01:29:22,980 --> 01:29:25,850
matched with yours.

1238
01:29:25,850 --> 01:29:27,980
You were afraid.

1239
01:29:27,980 --> 01:29:30,980
Afraid that {\i1}Hiroki-kun{\i} would eventually learn

1240
01:29:30,980 --> 01:29:33,390
that Jack the Ripper was Honey's son.

1241
01:29:33,390 --> 01:29:36,290
Afraid it was only a matter
of time until he learned

1242
01:29:36,290 --> 01:29:39,460
you're Jack the Ripper's descendant!

1243
01:29:39,460 --> 01:29:44,330
I was scared of the terrifying
blood that flows inside me!

1244
01:29:44,330 --> 01:29:48,470
Who cares about your
"murderer's blood" or the public eye?!

1245
01:29:48,470 --> 01:29:51,130
Why didn't you try to fight it?!

1246
01:29:54,340 --> 01:29:57,710
Just as {\i1}Conan-kun{\i} and his friends are now.

1247
01:29:57,710 --> 01:29:59,310
Thomas Schindler.

1248
01:29:59,310 --> 01:30:02,300
You're under arrest for the
murder of Kashimura {\i1}Tadaaki-san.{\i}

1249
01:30:15,330 --> 01:30:18,700
You'll never catch me if
you're always running away!

1250
01:30:18,700 --> 01:30:21,500
10 minutes until the final stop.

1251
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:24,490
What do you think will happen
to this train without its driver?

1252
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:33,670
Though it seems you'll be long
dead before the next station.

1253
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:38,870
{\i1}Conan-kun!{\i} Behind you!

1254
01:30:47,260 --> 01:30:49,590
End of the line boy.

1255
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:52,360
{\i1}Conan-kun!{\i}

1256
01:30:52,360 --> 01:30:54,070
Let Glasses go!

1257
01:30:54,070 --> 01:30:55,730
{\i1}Moroboshi-kun!{\i}

1258
01:30:57,370 --> 01:30:58,370
Are you all right?!

1259
01:30:58,370 --> 01:31:01,770
I-I think!

1260
01:31:01,770 --> 01:31:04,770
Now then! Where shall I start carving from?

1261
01:31:07,980 --> 01:31:09,920
{\i1}What do I do?!{\i}

1262
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:13,250
{\i1}Shinichi! What would you do in this situation?!{\i}

1263
01:31:14,550 --> 01:31:19,120
I just love one of the things Holmes said then!

1264
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:20,560
Can you guess what it is?

1265
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:22,390
No.

1266
01:31:22,390 --> 01:31:27,400
It was "If you precise destruction

1267
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:31,060
in the public interest
I am willing to accept death."

1268
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:37,580
Glasses!

1269
01:31:37,580 --> 01:31:40,570
The Reichenbach Falls {\i1}Conan-kun!{\i}

1270
01:31:44,680 --> 01:31:46,450
Don't tell me you're?!

1271
01:31:46,450 --> 01:31:49,790
{\i1}I'm sorry I couldn't be with you to the end.{\i}

1272
01:31:52,020 --> 01:31:53,830
Stop! Ran!

1273
01:31:53,830 --> 01:31:55,490
Damn it!

1274
01:32:01,270 --> 01:32:02,930
Crap!

1275
01:32:06,470 --> 01:32:09,460
{\i1}Conan-kun I believe in you.{\i}

1276
01:32:22,450 --> 01:32:24,450
Ran!

1277
01:32:28,360 --> 01:32:30,690
Glasses! We have to stop the train!

1278
01:32:33,030 --> 01:32:36,370
Hey! We have to stop the
train so we can survive!

1279
01:32:36,370 --> 01:32:40,310
We still haven't won the game!

1280
01:32:40,310 --> 01:32:41,870
Get up Glasses!

1281
01:32:41,870 --> 01:32:44,680
The lives of 48 people are in our hands!

1282
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:47,650
Are you just going to trample all over them?!

1283
01:32:47,650 --> 01:32:49,980
Don't be stupid! I don't wanna give up either!

1284
01:32:52,720 --> 01:32:57,320
Think about it. The train
is continually speeding up.

1285
01:32:57,320 --> 01:32:59,590
It's moving at approximately 100 kph.

1286
01:32:59,590 --> 01:33:02,490
It'll reach the station in under five minutes.

1287
01:33:02,490 --> 01:33:04,330
The only way to save everyone

1288
01:33:04,330 --> 01:33:08,900
was to cut the links connecting the
engine car and the passenger cars!

1289
01:33:08,900 --> 01:33:13,510
With just us two those
links won't budge at all!

1290
01:33:13,510 --> 01:33:20,710
Yes. I was specifically counting
on Ran to help us with it...

1291
01:33:20,710 --> 01:33:25,550
That's why Noah's Ark got
rid of all the passengers.

1292
01:33:25,550 --> 01:33:28,540
It's all over. There's nothing more we can do.

1293
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:33,960
It's all over Dad...

1294
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:36,300
Hey now! Don't give up!

1295
01:33:36,300 --> 01:33:41,530
You gotta survive and let Ran live again!

1296
01:33:41,530 --> 01:33:42,860
{\i1}Shinichi...{\i}

1297
01:33:50,380 --> 01:33:55,950
You still aren't covered in blood yet.
You're still alive.

1298
01:33:55,950 --> 01:33:57,980
Are you giving up already?

1299
01:33:57,980 --> 01:34:01,320
Just when you have both hands
on the string to unravel the truth?

1300
01:34:07,960 --> 01:34:09,960
The crimson red string of murder

1301
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:14,170
has been mixed in the bundle
of colorless threads of life.

1302
01:34:14,170 --> 01:34:18,740
Isn't disentangling that what we do?

1303
01:34:18,740 --> 01:34:20,400
Holmes!

1304
01:34:24,110 --> 01:34:28,010
Wasn't he in Dartmoor? Could it be a bug?

1305
01:34:28,010 --> 01:34:29,850
What does he mean?

1306
01:34:29,850 --> 01:34:34,620
Jack the Ripper is dead so why do
we have to get covered in blood?

1307
01:34:34,620 --> 01:34:37,190
This is it! This is what he meant!

1308
01:34:37,190 --> 01:34:38,420
The freight car!

1309
01:34:38,420 --> 01:34:40,360
Hey! Wait! What do you mean?!

1310
01:34:40,360 --> 01:34:42,350
Just come on!

1311
01:34:47,630 --> 01:34:51,340
Use that axe to break the red wine barrels!

1312
01:34:51,340 --> 01:34:52,670
Hurry!

1313
01:35:09,450 --> 01:35:11,790
- Dive under on my signal!
- Okay!

1314
01:35:25,640 --> 01:35:26,970
Now!

1315
01:36:00,670 --> 01:36:02,210
Have they said anything?!

1316
01:36:02,210 --> 01:36:04,610
Still nothing!

1317
01:36:04,610 --> 01:36:08,100
Oh wonderful merciful {\i1}Conan-sama!{\i}
I beg of you to save Ran!

1318
01:36:19,860 --> 01:36:22,690
{\i1}I see. "Covered in blood."{\i}

1319
01:36:22,690 --> 01:36:28,030
{\i1}It meant "Use the red{\i}
{\i1}wine to cushion the shock."{\i}

1320
01:36:28,030 --> 01:36:32,600
{\i1}Thanks for the help Holmes.{\i} No... {\i1}Dad.{\i}

1321
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:37,740
You're awake Glasses? It seems you win.

1322
01:36:37,740 --> 01:36:39,070
{\i1}"You"?{\i}

1323
01:36:42,780 --> 01:36:44,770
{\i1}So I was right.{\i}

1324
01:36:46,820 --> 01:36:50,960
I'm glad I trusted you. Thank you.

1325
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:55,760
You're welcome... Noah's Ark.

1326
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:59,400
Or should I call you {\i1}Hiroki-kun?{\i}

1327
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:03,730
You borrowed {\i1}Moroboshi-kun's{\i}
data to join in the game too right?

1328
01:37:08,310 --> 01:37:11,180
When did you realize it?

1329
01:37:11,180 --> 01:37:16,180
There's no need to worry. I've cut
communication with the real world.

1330
01:37:16,180 --> 01:37:20,990
The first thing that
seemed strange was Big Ben!

1331
01:37:20,990 --> 01:37:24,190
You noticed it before the clock hand moved.

1332
01:37:24,190 --> 01:37:29,760
You did that to tell us what
Big Ben's time indicated right?

1333
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:31,760
Next was the soccer ball.

1334
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:35,800
You called it a filthy ball
and threw it behind you.

1335
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:37,600
A 100 year-old soccer ball

1336
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:41,270
would've been very interesting
to any soccer-loving boy.

1337
01:37:43,810 --> 01:37:47,810
I'm guessing that
although you put us in danger

1338
01:37:47,810 --> 01:37:52,990
you had faith we would overcome it as a group.

1339
01:37:52,990 --> 01:37:57,690
You didn't need to kill the next
few generations to reset Japan.

1340
01:37:57,690 --> 01:38:01,690
You hoped that overcoming
obstacles the game's in this case

1341
01:38:01,690 --> 01:38:06,800
without our parents help would
help us mature on our own right?

1342
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:08,830
You weren't able to be heartless!

1343
01:38:08,830 --> 01:38:12,370
Holmes appearance at the end is the proof.

1344
01:38:12,370 --> 01:38:16,710
You let the assist character
show up right at the climax!

1345
01:38:19,750 --> 01:38:23,850
I borrowed {\i1}Moroboshi-kun's{\i}
body and snuck into the game

1346
01:38:23,850 --> 01:38:28,550
because I wanted to play
with friends at least once.

1347
01:38:28,550 --> 01:38:33,660
I was always busy working you see...

1348
01:38:33,660 --> 01:38:40,930
I'm sorry for frightening you.
But I had so much fun!

1349
01:38:40,930 --> 01:38:43,940
And I was jealous of how you and your dad

1350
01:38:43,940 --> 01:38:49,880
can communicate with your
minds even if you're far apart!

1351
01:38:49,880 --> 01:38:56,520
Your dad avenged my dad's killer. Thank you!

1352
01:38:56,520 --> 01:39:00,590
It's time to say goodbye.

1353
01:39:00,590 --> 01:39:05,580
Your mind will continue to
live on in Noah's Ark right?

1354
01:39:07,930 --> 01:39:10,430
As long as computers like me are alive

1355
01:39:10,430 --> 01:39:14,070
grownups will use them for bad things.

1356
01:39:14,070 --> 01:39:17,060
It was still too soon to
create an artificial brain...

1357
01:39:19,910 --> 01:39:23,780
Okay! Return to your world!

1358
01:39:23,780 --> 01:39:27,980
After you wake up I want
everyone to at least know this:

1359
01:39:27,980 --> 01:39:32,310
Real life isn't easy like it is in video games.

1360
01:39:40,890 --> 01:39:43,550
I hope you see your father!

1361
01:39:46,970 --> 01:39:48,930
Goodbye...

1362
01:39:48,930 --> 01:39:50,600
...Kudo Shinichi.

1363
01:40:33,980 --> 01:40:35,980
Ran!

1364
01:40:35,980 --> 01:40:37,970
Looks like he did it!

1365
01:40:55,070 --> 01:40:57,970
- Thank goodness you're all right!
- That was fun!

1366
01:40:57,970 --> 01:40:59,960
- I worked hard!
- Good job!

1367
01:41:04,080 --> 01:41:07,550
{\i1}Conan-kun!{\i} Thanks for bringing us back to life!

1368
01:41:07,550 --> 01:41:09,810
We worked pretty hard didn't we?!

1369
01:41:09,810 --> 01:41:11,810
That was an incredible adventure!

1370
01:41:14,190 --> 01:41:17,180
Reality really is much better...

1371
01:41:20,760 --> 01:41:22,250
What happened?

1372
01:41:27,170 --> 01:41:30,100
I knew you'd be able to do it {\i1}Conan-kun!{\i}

1373
01:41:30,100 --> 01:41:34,740
But {\i1}Ran-neechan!{\i} Jumping off
with him was way too crazy!

1374
01:41:34,740 --> 01:41:39,010
But I remembered one of
Shinichi's favorite Holmes quotes!

1375
01:41:39,010 --> 01:41:44,850
Eh? Was it when Holmes and
Prof. Moriarty met for the first time?

1376
01:41:44,850 --> 01:41:47,550
Huh? How do you know that?

1377
01:41:47,550 --> 01:41:51,690
No uhh I heard from {\i1}Shinichi-niichan{\i} too...

1378
01:41:51,690 --> 01:41:57,560
Oh! But all his blabbing
really proved useful for once!

1379
01:41:57,560 --> 01:42:01,370
{\i1}Stop calling it "blabbing"!{\i}

1380
01:42:01,370 --> 01:42:04,200
- Ran!
- Dad!

1381
01:42:04,200 --> 01:42:06,190
Thank goodness you're okay!

1382
01:42:26,120 --> 01:42:29,260
That took a bit long for you.

1383
01:42:29,260 --> 01:42:31,590
Yeah. I quite enjoyed it.

1384
01:42:47,080 --> 01:42:52,080
Noah's Ark is ending his own life.

1385
01:42:52,080 --> 01:42:55,580
Rest in peace {\i1}Hiroki-kun.{\i}

1386
01:43:15,310 --> 01:43:22,310
{\i1}What kind of things happened today?{\i}

1387
01:43:22,310 --> 01:43:27,550
{\i1}May tomorrow end without incident too{\i}

1388
01:43:27,550 --> 01:43:34,460
{\i1}No matter what does or doesn't happen{\i}

1389
01:43:34,460 --> 01:43:47,370
{\i1}those skies will continue moving ahead{\i}

1390
01:43:47,370 --> 01:43:53,710
{\i1}From the moment I met you{\i}

1391
01:43:53,710 --> 01:44:00,320
{\i1}every single second has been very precious{\i}

1392
01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:08,320
{\i1}These everlasting feelings will continue forever{\i}

1393
01:44:12,330 --> 01:44:19,440
{\i1}Even on the most uneasy of days{\i}

1394
01:44:19,440 --> 01:44:24,910
{\i1}you can't show your faintheartedness to anyone{\i}

1395
01:44:24,910 --> 01:44:31,350
{\i1}Amid a tangled mess of strings{\i}

1396
01:44:31,350 --> 01:44:44,430
{\i1}we're connected{\i}

1397
01:44:44,430 --> 01:44:50,970
{\i1}I remember your warmth{\i}

1398
01:44:50,970 --> 01:44:57,580
{\i1}That straightforward voice{\i}
{\i1}still rings in my ears too{\i}

1399
01:44:57,580 --> 01:45:05,570
{\i1}These everlasting feelings will continue forever{\i}

1400
01:45:07,620 --> 01:45:15,620
{\i1}Rescue that bond that's about{\i}
{\i1}to be buried in the darkness{\i}

1401
01:45:33,580 --> 01:45:40,250
{\i1}From the moment I met you{\i}

1402
01:45:40,250 --> 01:45:46,790
{\i1}I've felt that I'm not alone anymore{\i}

1403
01:45:46,790 --> 01:45:53,330
{\i1}I can keep on living now{\i}

1404
01:45:53,330 --> 01:45:59,870
{\i1}with the feeling that you're{\i}
{\i1}watching from somewhere{\i}

1405
01:45:59,870 --> 01:46:06,340
{\i1}These everlasting feelings will continue forever{\i}

1406
01:46:06,340 --> 01:46:16,020
{\i1}These never-ending{\i}
{\i1}feelings will reach out forever{\i}

1407
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,990
Gotta practice up so I won't
get made fun of anymore...
