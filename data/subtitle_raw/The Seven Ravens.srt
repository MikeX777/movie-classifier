1
00:00:00,247 --> 00:00:03,523
From 1929 to 1970 the
Diehl brothers ran
Germany's greatest
stop-motion studio

2
00:00:03,727 --> 00:00:06,480
in the city of Graefelfing.
The "pioneers of puppetry cinema"

3
00:00:06,727 --> 00:00:09,116
produced over 60 fairy tale
and educational movies.

4
00:00:09,327 --> 00:00:12,603
THE SEVEN RAVENS
from 1937 was the first
German feature-length
puppetry movie.

5
00:00:12,847 --> 00:00:15,805
Even today the movie impresses via
its lovingly crafted characters,

6
00:00:16,047 --> 00:00:18,515
its naturallstic decor,
and pollshed use of llght.

7
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:22,003
Due to the old stock, the picture and
audio quallty don't
meet current ideals.

8
00:00:28,567 --> 00:00:31,240
The Seven Ravens

9
00:00:33,127 --> 00:00:37,803
a Diehl brothers movie

10
00:01:12,327 --> 00:01:15,000
Oh children.

11
00:01:16,167 --> 00:01:20,843
lt's not exactly a pleasure
to lie in such a dark box.

12
00:01:21,967 --> 00:01:24,640
Broken into two pieces.

13
00:01:25,047 --> 00:01:27,720
And the head wrapped in silk paper.

14
00:01:27,967 --> 00:01:31,323
But I'm only a puppet.

15
00:01:32,167 --> 00:01:35,125
Then it's of course
all the same to me.

16
00:01:35,447 --> 00:01:37,642
llke that are the humans.

17
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:42,125
And they fancy themselves
as something quite exceptional.

18
00:01:43,167 --> 00:01:45,920
A human should just try
to walk onto the stage...

19
00:01:46,167 --> 00:01:51,719
and attempt to repllcate all the
wonderful events
which we'll show you.

20
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:57,918
We, on the other hand, will entertain
you this evening with our act.

21
00:01:58,167 --> 00:02:01,523
Our tricks will move you into
a state of astonishment.

22
00:02:01,727 --> 00:02:09,725
By an act ... which is
about, how some
humans were
transformed into ravens.

23
00:02:10,727 --> 00:02:17,485
ln short. l swear:
You'll be much amused
by our movie ...

24
00:02:18,567 --> 00:02:20,444
The Seven Ravens.

25
00:02:30,047 --> 00:02:32,322
The Seven Ravens

26
00:02:53,647 --> 00:02:56,798
- A beautiful girl.
- She's beautiful, yes.

27
00:02:57,047 --> 00:02:59,720
But also to blame for
her brothers's misfortune.

28
00:02:59,927 --> 00:03:03,476
Her ...
to blame for her
brothers's misfortune?

29
00:03:03,847 --> 00:03:05,997
What do you mean, dear women?

30
00:03:06,447 --> 00:03:11,123
l better let your mother tell you that.
She knows it better than l .

31
00:03:13,567 --> 00:03:16,320
Don't you know the
story, neighbour?

32
00:03:36,047 --> 00:03:37,400
You ... mother?

33
00:03:38,047 --> 00:03:39,116
What is it?

34
00:03:39,327 --> 00:03:42,797
The women at the well
said something terrible.

35
00:03:43,047 --> 00:03:45,800
What is it?
Has an accident occurred?

36
00:03:46,167 --> 00:03:50,558
The women said, that l'm to blame
for my brothers's misfortune.

37
00:03:50,727 --> 00:03:53,605
Mother, tell me.
Do l have brothers?

38
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:57,639
- Who have said that?
- The women at the well.

39
00:03:57,847 --> 00:04:01,920
Those terrible people!
Can't they just leave us alone.

40
00:04:02,447 --> 00:04:08,238
Mother, tell me about my brothers.
I'm so terribIy frightened.

41
00:04:08,567 --> 00:04:12,242
l'll tell it.
They ought to have left you alone.

42
00:04:12,567 --> 00:04:16,321
Mother. Please, please
tell me what has happened.

43
00:04:16,726 --> 00:04:20,594
- What l've done.
- You haven't done anything.

44
00:04:22,247 --> 00:04:25,922
lt was a misfortune back then.
Alas!

45
00:04:26,847 --> 00:04:31,318
And to what use is it to talk about
a misfortune which you can't revert?

46
00:04:31,567 --> 00:04:37,722
But mother, why do
people then point
fingers at me and
say that I'm guilty?

47
00:04:38,247 --> 00:04:42,399
No. They should not do so
and they're not allowed to do so.

48
00:04:42,927 --> 00:04:46,203
But now it has happened.
I didn't want it.

49
00:04:47,567 --> 00:04:50,525
So you'll discover
everything, by God.

50
00:04:51,367 --> 00:04:54,518
Sit yourself down here...
in the chair...

51
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:56,724
as a sensible person.

52
00:04:59,647 --> 00:05:01,922
Yes.
lt's true.

53
00:05:03,047 --> 00:05:04,526
You have brothers.

54
00:05:05,127 --> 00:05:06,480
Seven of them.

55
00:05:07,567 --> 00:05:09,637
By God, seven great boys.

56
00:05:09,847 --> 00:05:13,840
And they filled the house to the roof
with their shouts and racket.

57
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:17,403
Then the both of us fervently
wanted a llttle girl.

58
00:05:17,647 --> 00:05:21,720
Such that a llttle gentleness
would also enter our house.

59
00:05:21,927 --> 00:05:25,397
But for a long time our
wish remained unfulfilled.

60
00:05:25,727 --> 00:05:28,400
But finally ... you were born.

61
00:05:29,247 --> 00:05:33,115
And our joy was great.
But you were frail and small.

62
00:05:33,847 --> 00:05:37,203
And due to your frailty you
needed an emergency baptism.

63
00:05:37,447 --> 00:05:42,919
Then father sent your
oldest brother to
the well ... to get baptismal water.

64
00:05:43,727 --> 00:05:48,596
But the six others
ran along. Because
each wanted be be
first at the bucket...

65
00:05:48,847 --> 00:05:51,202
the jar fell into the well.

66
00:05:53,927 --> 00:05:58,079
There they stood...
and they didn't know what to do.

67
00:05:59,047 --> 00:06:01,322
And no one dared to go home.

68
00:06:02,367 --> 00:06:06,121
As they didn't return
father was anxious and said:

69
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:10,440
For sure, they have
once again forgotten
about it during play.
Those unruly boys.

70
00:06:10,647 --> 00:06:14,845
But he was frightened.
You could die unbaptised.

71
00:06:15,847 --> 00:06:21,114
And in anger he called out: "l want
all the boys to turn into ravens".

72
00:06:21,847 --> 00:06:24,407
Barely had the words been uttered...

73
00:06:24,647 --> 00:06:28,515
before he heard a buzzing
in the air above his head.

74
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:30,200
He looked up...

75
00:06:31,247 --> 00:06:34,125
and saw seven
ravens black as coal...

76
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:36,804
llft off and fly away.

77
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:43,523
Thus all seven of them ...
had really turned into ravens.

78
00:06:45,127 --> 00:06:48,403
So that's why the women
at the well said...

79
00:06:48,647 --> 00:06:51,320
that l'm to blame for
my brothers's misfortune.

80
00:06:51,567 --> 00:06:54,525
Oh, how can people
utter such twaddle.

81
00:06:56,367 --> 00:06:57,925
Only the heavens...

82
00:06:58,567 --> 00:07:00,717
have imposed this misfortune on us.

83
00:07:01,447 --> 00:07:04,405
But ... if l hadn't been born...

84
00:07:05,367 --> 00:07:09,042
then my brothers would
have remained human llke us.

85
00:07:09,247 --> 00:07:11,203
Certainly, ... my child.

86
00:07:12,447 --> 00:07:17,396
Nevertheless were you only the
innocent cause of all the misfortune.

87
00:07:18,447 --> 00:07:20,403
You mustn't grieve.

88
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:25,639
Since l was the reason
for the misfortune...

89
00:07:25,847 --> 00:07:30,204
then surely, l should also
be the one ... who frees them.

90
00:07:30,447 --> 00:07:34,042
Oh child ...
How would you do that?

91
00:07:35,367 --> 00:07:38,439
No person knows
where they've gone to.

92
00:07:38,847 --> 00:07:41,998
No one have heard
anything from them since.

93
00:07:42,247 --> 00:07:47,321
- Have you searched for them?
- Look among the
ravens in the field,...

94
00:07:47,727 --> 00:07:50,321
they have as black
feathers as the others.

95
00:07:50,567 --> 00:07:52,046
And their voices, ...

96
00:07:52,247 --> 00:07:56,399
oh dear, they're as unintelllgible
to humans as raven voices are.

97
00:07:56,647 --> 00:07:59,525
But they're no ordinary
ravens, mother.

98
00:07:59,727 --> 00:08:03,402
So they'll not be llving and
dwelllng among the other ravens.

99
00:08:03,647 --> 00:08:08,835
lf one only tried to look for them, ...
one would be sure to find them.

100
00:08:09,367 --> 00:08:13,519
And even if you wanted to travel
to the end of the world...

101
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:16,082
you would still not
be able to find them.

102
00:08:16,367 --> 00:08:20,838
What can a frail human do ...
against the power of the heavens?

103
00:08:22,727 --> 00:08:25,605
But now it's time to go to bed, child.

104
00:08:26,247 --> 00:08:28,841
Father will come home late today.

105
00:08:29,367 --> 00:08:31,039
Good night, mother.

106
00:08:31,727 --> 00:08:33,797
Good night, child.

107
00:09:56,367 --> 00:09:59,439
- Good evening, lady.
- It's you, father?

108
00:10:01,967 --> 00:10:04,117
ls the girl already in bed?

109
00:10:05,447 --> 00:10:08,439
What's the matter?
You're so quiet today.

110
00:10:08,647 --> 00:10:10,000
What's going on?

111
00:10:10,647 --> 00:10:12,319
Those wicked people.

112
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:15,324
You have your trouble with them.

113
00:10:15,527 --> 00:10:17,483
Why?
What has happened?

114
00:10:18,447 --> 00:10:21,200
They've told her about her brothers.

115
00:10:22,447 --> 00:10:25,519
Then nothing could be done.
l had to tell her everything.

116
00:10:27,367 --> 00:10:29,517
Can't they just keep shut!

117
00:10:31,367 --> 00:10:33,517
And what is the girl then up to?

118
00:10:33,727 --> 00:10:37,083
- Tell me.
- It has naturally gotten to her.

119
00:10:39,127 --> 00:10:42,199
Who knows ...
what will come of it.

120
00:12:07,047 --> 00:12:10,119
Where are you going to
so early, llttle one?

121
00:12:10,527 --> 00:12:12,483
l go to search for my brothers.

122
00:12:12,727 --> 00:12:16,481
Oh, then you first
need to grow wings.

123
00:12:16,727 --> 00:12:20,322
Such that you can look
in the raven nests.

124
00:12:45,847 --> 00:12:48,315
What are you doing there, girl?

125
00:12:48,967 --> 00:12:51,242
l go to search for my brothers.

126
00:12:51,447 --> 00:12:54,439
Dear God!
Your brothers.

127
00:12:55,367 --> 00:12:58,439
No road leads to them.

128
00:13:53,127 --> 00:13:55,880
Oh, girl.
Why do you come here?

129
00:13:56,847 --> 00:13:59,315
Have you lost your way
while looking for berries?

130
00:13:59,527 --> 00:14:02,599
Oh no.
l go to search for my brothers.

131
00:14:03,047 --> 00:14:05,845
Here?
ln the centre of the forest?

132
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:09,995
Here is only bears
and wolfs, my child.

133
00:14:10,247 --> 00:14:13,922
But your brothers, ...
them you will not find here.

134
00:14:14,367 --> 00:14:17,040
Come.
I'll follow you home.

135
00:14:17,527 --> 00:14:20,087
l have no fear of bears or wolfs.

136
00:14:20,647 --> 00:14:24,720
l don't want to go home
before l've found my brothers.

137
00:15:07,727 --> 00:15:10,195
lf just someone would tell me...

138
00:15:10,447 --> 00:15:12,324
where my brothers are.

139
00:15:25,047 --> 00:15:29,643
Your brothers llve far from here
in the shining mountain.

140
00:15:31,727 --> 00:15:34,605
lf you want to keep silent
for seven years...

141
00:15:35,847 --> 00:15:38,441
and spin seven shirts...

142
00:15:40,727 --> 00:15:43,480
such that you can make
this into a promise to me, ...

143
00:15:43,727 --> 00:15:46,082
you'll free your brothers.

144
00:15:49,447 --> 00:15:51,005
Yes, good fairy.

145
00:15:52,367 --> 00:15:54,244
l'll promise it to you.

146
00:15:57,127 --> 00:15:58,082
Very well.

147
00:15:59,367 --> 00:16:03,963
Then you shall see your brothers
again in seven years from now.

148
00:16:04,127 --> 00:16:06,004
Healthy and joyous.

149
00:22:43,327 --> 00:22:48,606
That is the story of seven brothers
who were turned into ravens.

150
00:22:48,847 --> 00:22:51,122
But where have they gone to?

151
00:22:51,527 --> 00:22:55,998
lt's told, that they llve
in a shining mountain...

152
00:22:57,047 --> 00:22:59,607
at the very end of the world.

153
00:23:00,327 --> 00:23:03,797
There they llve in the
shape of ravens, but...

154
00:23:04,047 --> 00:23:06,436
with their human
hearts in their chests.

155
00:23:06,647 --> 00:23:11,402
Waiting for the day on which
they'll receive their freedom.

156
00:23:13,447 --> 00:23:15,915
And what has
happened to the sister?

157
00:23:16,727 --> 00:23:20,117
She has left her home
to search for the brothers

158
00:23:21,047 --> 00:23:24,119
Now she has been away
for about six years.

159
00:23:24,327 --> 00:23:27,797
No person knows what
has become of her.

160
00:23:29,847 --> 00:23:34,921
The story is good. But what l
smell over there is much better.

161
00:23:37,967 --> 00:23:41,039
An amorous odour reveals you.

162
00:23:42,247 --> 00:23:45,637
ln such a way,
can only a ready roast smell.

163
00:23:46,047 --> 00:23:47,605
Do you hear, cook?

164
00:23:48,047 --> 00:23:51,801
The roast is ruined
if you let it wait any longer.

165
00:23:52,327 --> 00:23:55,603
Just look how the tears run down.

166
00:23:56,447 --> 00:24:00,122
These disgusting, oily, greasy tears.

167
00:24:00,967 --> 00:24:03,640
Hands off!
The prince hasn't returned yet...

168
00:24:03,847 --> 00:24:07,840
- and we have to wait for that.
- I see, the prince wants meatloaf.

169
00:24:08,047 --> 00:24:12,598
- Why meatloaf?
- Soon it'll be tough llke leather.

170
00:24:13,247 --> 00:24:16,717
And then you have to exchange
the prince's knife with a chopper.

171
00:24:16,967 --> 00:24:18,844
Shut your loose mouth!

172
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:21,237
The prince must have lost his way.

173
00:24:25,967 --> 00:24:28,435
Do you hear it?
They aIready blow the horn.

174
00:24:54,047 --> 00:24:55,799
Who are you, my love?

175
00:24:57,847 --> 00:25:02,841
What are you doing here in this wild
forest? Don't you want to talk?

176
00:25:03,167 --> 00:25:05,317
Why?
Are you mute?

177
00:25:06,967 --> 00:25:10,926
Have you lost your language
here in this lonellness?

178
00:25:12,527 --> 00:25:15,200
Whoever you may
be, keep it a secret.

179
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:17,802
Never was there such a beauty.

180
00:25:18,727 --> 00:25:20,479
Will you come with me?

181
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:23,116
You'll get everything you desire.

182
00:26:01,967 --> 00:26:04,242
So the prince is back again.

183
00:26:05,167 --> 00:26:10,036
lt was about time.
Otherwise something
would have happened
to the loveIy roast.

184
00:26:10,247 --> 00:26:13,717
- You ate a lot, you did.
- Ate a lot here, ate a Iot there.

185
00:26:13,967 --> 00:26:17,437
For me a juicy boar haunch
in drippings is more precious...

186
00:26:17,647 --> 00:26:20,639
than a mute forest virgin
inside a hollow tree.

187
00:26:20,847 --> 00:26:22,519
What!
Is she mute?

188
00:26:22,967 --> 00:26:26,437
As mute as the carps
in our castle moat.

189
00:26:26,847 --> 00:26:29,645
And even then she wants
to become the prince's wife?

190
00:26:29,847 --> 00:26:31,041
Why not?

191
00:26:31,727 --> 00:26:36,482
She doesn't complain, doesn't talk
back, and he always
has the last word.

192
00:26:36,727 --> 00:26:39,195
l couldn't wish for
a better wife myself.

193
00:26:39,447 --> 00:26:42,644
- Look, there she comes!
- How beautiful!

194
00:26:43,247 --> 00:26:49,800
They've sent a courier to the castle
to try out the prettiest dresses there.

195
00:27:12,967 --> 00:27:14,241
Hey ... Hans!

196
00:27:15,327 --> 00:27:18,285
Well, you must hurry in advance
to the castle and bring the news...

197
00:27:18,527 --> 00:27:22,406
that the prince and his
future consort will enter shortIy.

198
00:27:22,647 --> 00:27:26,515
You, Joenk. You shall report the
prince's command
to the majordomo.

199
00:27:26,727 --> 00:27:30,276
That everything should
be prepared for the wedding.

200
00:27:33,327 --> 00:27:35,682
This time sayings were wrong!

201
00:27:36,727 --> 00:27:38,126
To the wedding!

202
00:28:55,167 --> 00:28:56,316
Hey ... lady.

203
00:28:57,047 --> 00:28:59,436
You're celebrating
a wedding today, right?

204
00:28:59,647 --> 00:29:03,799
Certainly sir.
Our gracious prince is marrying.

205
00:29:04,447 --> 00:29:06,119
- That's it?
- Yes.

206
00:29:06,647 --> 00:29:10,322
- And what's the name
of the princess?
- The princess?

207
00:29:10,967 --> 00:29:14,516
He has found her in the forest.
No one knows...

208
00:29:21,727 --> 00:29:27,279
...obviously. Look at
the disgrace. That
a prince doesn't seek
out a better wife!

209
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:55,320
- You, see how pretty she is.
- It's such a shame that she's mute.

210
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:57,916
God forbid that their
children will be mute too.

211
00:29:58,167 --> 00:29:59,839
You, her brothers are...

212
00:30:01,447 --> 00:30:03,722
Come with me to the fairground.

213
00:33:41,047 --> 00:33:42,196
Oh yes!

214
00:33:42,727 --> 00:33:46,003
lt was a magnificent wedding party.

215
00:33:47,167 --> 00:33:50,523
Since then no poor
has had to starve.

216
00:33:51,727 --> 00:33:54,002
Come Marta.
Let's go.

217
00:33:54,847 --> 00:33:56,235
It's time.

218
00:35:20,047 --> 00:35:23,801
She has a tendency to compassion,
the good princess.

219
00:35:24,047 --> 00:35:27,517
The people say that she know of
no other sorrow than the poor.

220
00:35:27,727 --> 00:35:30,799
lf she would just become
an example for many...

221
00:35:31,047 --> 00:35:33,800
of the comfortable in the country.

222
00:35:34,247 --> 00:35:39,799
l hear that she keeps
the llght on late
at night and sits
working assiduously.

223
00:36:14,247 --> 00:36:20,038
llsten gentlemen,
and let me tell you...

224
00:36:20,847 --> 00:36:26,001
now the bell has rung ten times.

225
00:36:27,447 --> 00:36:33,204
Extinguish the fire and the llght...

226
00:36:34,247 --> 00:36:41,403
so no harm is sent to you.

227
00:37:06,167 --> 00:37:11,241
llsten gentlemen,
and let me tell you...

228
00:37:12,327 --> 00:37:18,004
now the bell has rung twelve times.

229
00:37:18,847 --> 00:37:24,319
Extinguish the fire and the llght...

230
00:37:25,927 --> 00:37:32,480
so no harm is sent to you.

231
00:37:43,447 --> 00:37:47,122
Lord, today is the most
beautiful spring morning.

232
00:37:47,647 --> 00:37:50,923
Let us rejoice that
the awful winter is over.

233
00:37:51,167 --> 00:37:55,240
- It's dangerous to stroll in the park.
- Why is that?

234
00:37:55,927 --> 00:38:00,284
Because the trees leap out,
the grass shoots and the sun stings.

235
00:38:01,847 --> 00:38:03,121
Well done, jester.

236
00:38:04,167 --> 00:38:05,156
Enter.

237
00:38:07,847 --> 00:38:11,806
l have the very dellghtful task
of reporting to Your Serenity,...

238
00:38:12,047 --> 00:38:14,402
that this very night
two princes were born.

239
00:38:14,647 --> 00:38:16,638
Two princes you say.
l must see them.

240
00:38:16,847 --> 00:38:21,637
Your Serenity is asked
to wait a moment.
Until they've been washed.

241
00:38:21,847 --> 00:38:25,920
Tell me.
Do you know ...
whether they can talk?

242
00:38:26,647 --> 00:38:28,524
Your Serenity may be unworried.

243
00:38:28,727 --> 00:38:32,197
They've already impudently
shrieked loudIy.

244
00:38:32,567 --> 00:38:33,716
Thank heavens!

245
00:38:34,927 --> 00:38:37,999
Such fine llttle boys!

246
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:43,560
The gracious lord shall present
them to us in a ceremony.

247
00:38:43,927 --> 00:38:47,203
We're exposed to
such noble princes.

248
00:38:55,047 --> 00:38:57,117
Good Lord!
She's a witch!

249
00:39:00,447 --> 00:39:01,721
Keep silent...

250
00:39:02,327 --> 00:39:05,285
otherwise you won't
free your brothers.

251
00:39:11,567 --> 00:39:12,716
lt is so.

252
00:39:12,927 --> 00:39:14,485
ls it really true?

253
00:39:15,567 --> 00:39:16,443
Talk.

254
00:39:17,167 --> 00:39:18,316
For my sake.

255
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:23,914
For your sake, for your children's
sake! Tell me, explain
what it means.

256
00:39:24,167 --> 00:39:25,839
She is a witch...

257
00:39:26,927 --> 00:39:28,679
that's what it means.

258
00:39:30,727 --> 00:39:33,002
And I tell you, she's a witch.

259
00:39:33,247 --> 00:39:38,321
And l tell you, you're a donkey.
A donkey. A donkey!

260
00:39:38,847 --> 00:39:41,645
So you know better than
the high court, jester?

261
00:39:41,847 --> 00:39:45,317
She's accused of the witchery ...
and tomorrow the court will be held.

262
00:39:45,567 --> 00:39:47,444
Accused. Accused.

263
00:39:48,327 --> 00:39:54,197
Accused have many with souls
as pure as this cup of wine been.

264
00:39:55,047 --> 00:39:57,925
lf she's a witch, then l'm
the devil's grandmother.

265
00:39:58,167 --> 00:40:01,045
The jester is right.
The woman have
noting wrong done.

266
00:40:01,247 --> 00:40:03,124
She cared for the poor
llke for her children.

267
00:40:03,327 --> 00:40:08,117
llke for her children. Yes, yes,
she turned them all into ravens.

268
00:40:09,247 --> 00:40:10,646
Well, all right.

269
00:40:10,847 --> 00:40:13,998
lf you're without blame ... so talk!

270
00:40:15,327 --> 00:40:17,283
Where are your children?

271
00:40:19,647 --> 00:40:23,526
You're under suspicion
of the sorcery.
Do you hear?

272
00:40:24,167 --> 00:40:27,159
lf you know of a
defence ... then talk.

273
00:40:30,927 --> 00:40:33,680
Judge, you see that
she keeps silent.

274
00:40:36,447 --> 00:40:39,439
l ask you for the Iast time.

275
00:40:40,847 --> 00:40:43,520
Let us know through your mouth.

276
00:40:43,927 --> 00:40:46,885
Or through the mouth
of someone else.

277
00:40:47,247 --> 00:40:49,715
Where are the both of your boys?

278
00:40:53,567 --> 00:40:57,446
Since you stubbornly
and persistently keeps silent,...

279
00:40:57,927 --> 00:41:00,600
doesn't give us
information and direction...

280
00:41:00,847 --> 00:41:04,396
about what has happened
to the both of your boys, ...

281
00:41:04,647 --> 00:41:08,322
we declare you guilty ...
of the witchery.

282
00:41:11,647 --> 00:41:16,323
l break the rod over you
and sentence you to death by fire.

283
00:41:18,727 --> 00:41:21,195
Death ... by fire.

284
00:41:24,167 --> 00:41:25,566
That's dreadful.

285
00:41:25,847 --> 00:41:29,920
Poor brother. It's nevertheless so.
You've fallen victim to a witch.

286
00:41:30,167 --> 00:41:31,316
To a witch?
No.

287
00:41:32,647 --> 00:41:35,719
So beautiful, ...
so pure, so noble...

288
00:41:37,167 --> 00:41:39,715
- can that be a witch?
- That's exactly why.

289
00:41:39,927 --> 00:41:44,205
Hideous and base-souled
she would never
have been able to
bewitch your heart.

290
00:41:44,447 --> 00:41:49,521
Because she's a sorceress, she can
choose any form to
seduce a human heart.

291
00:41:49,647 --> 00:41:53,526
- You're heartless, sister!
- No. I aIso loved her.

292
00:41:53,727 --> 00:41:57,686
But can you deny that your
children have turned into ravens?

293
00:41:57,927 --> 00:42:01,476
Can that have happened through
anything else then sorcery?

294
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:03,285
The court's envoy.

295
00:42:08,647 --> 00:42:12,799
ln the name and commission of
the high ecclesiastical court...

296
00:42:13,047 --> 00:42:14,799
here is the sentence.

297
00:42:15,327 --> 00:42:18,125
The tribunal asks for your signature.

298
00:42:18,567 --> 00:42:19,841
My signature?

299
00:42:21,727 --> 00:42:22,603
No.

300
00:42:23,247 --> 00:42:25,397
My prince, ...
remember...

301
00:42:26,327 --> 00:42:28,875
- if you don't sign,...
- Well?

302
00:42:29,567 --> 00:42:34,322
they would say that in your country
there's no longer any justice.

303
00:42:35,567 --> 00:42:40,561
She have handed
over the inheritors
of the country to the evil powers.

304
00:42:41,047 --> 00:42:43,402
For her there's no judgement...

305
00:42:44,247 --> 00:42:46,124
- because...
- Well because?

306
00:42:46,327 --> 00:42:50,479
because the love of
the prince safeguards her.

307
00:42:52,047 --> 00:42:56,802
They would say that your judges,
know how to strike the poor...

308
00:42:57,727 --> 00:43:01,606
but the powerful are allowed
to commit every crime.

309
00:43:06,327 --> 00:43:07,203
Sister.

310
00:43:08,727 --> 00:43:10,285
What do you think?

311
00:43:10,567 --> 00:43:12,637
You don't have any choice.

312
00:43:14,647 --> 00:43:16,126
Let me be alone.

313
00:44:22,927 --> 00:44:23,882
What do you want?

314
00:44:24,167 --> 00:44:26,920
- Inside, strict sir.
- In prison?

315
00:44:27,647 --> 00:44:30,115
That couId only a jester wish for.

316
00:44:30,327 --> 00:44:33,125
She must be sorrowful,
our princess.

317
00:44:33,727 --> 00:44:36,685
I think, that to allow a few
songs might do her good.

318
00:44:36,927 --> 00:44:40,602
There's nothing here. She is no
longer a princess.
Do you understand?

319
00:44:40,847 --> 00:44:44,123
A witch condemned to death
is heId prisoner here.

320
00:44:44,847 --> 00:44:47,919
What do you say?
Condemned to death?

321
00:44:48,927 --> 00:44:52,806
Then the prince would first
have had to sign, l believe.

322
00:44:53,047 --> 00:44:55,402
The prince have signed.

323
00:44:56,847 --> 00:44:59,520
Signed, ... you say?

324
00:45:00,847 --> 00:45:01,916
The prince?

325
00:45:10,847 --> 00:45:12,519
Signed.

326
00:45:22,927 --> 00:45:24,679
They want you dead.

327
00:45:25,927 --> 00:45:29,602
l can't object against
them if you don't talk.

328
00:45:29,927 --> 00:45:32,395
Only you can prevent the horror.

329
00:45:33,927 --> 00:45:36,202
You can trust me completely.

330
00:45:39,847 --> 00:45:40,916
Tomorrow...

331
00:45:41,647 --> 00:45:44,195
the sentence will be consummated.

332
00:45:45,167 --> 00:45:46,316
Do you hear?

333
00:45:49,167 --> 00:45:52,637
Call on me ...
if you change your mind.

334
00:45:59,247 --> 00:46:00,396
Your time...

335
00:46:01,167 --> 00:46:02,839
have not yet passed.

336
00:46:04,727 --> 00:46:05,796
Think of...

337
00:46:06,647 --> 00:46:08,046
your brothers.

338
00:46:58,447 --> 00:47:00,915
Father, ...
get your morning soup.

339
00:47:01,167 --> 00:47:03,556
l can not eat anything, child.

340
00:47:04,927 --> 00:47:07,805
Today they want to
burn the princess.

341
00:47:08,327 --> 00:47:09,203
Yes.

342
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:13,520
The good days are over now.

343
00:47:14,247 --> 00:47:16,397
l am old and bllnd.

344
00:47:17,567 --> 00:47:20,115
But ...
this one thing l know.

345
00:47:21,247 --> 00:47:23,317
The princess is innocent.

346
00:47:25,447 --> 00:47:27,642
Come Marta.
Let us go.

347
00:47:29,327 --> 00:47:31,283
I no longer have any peace.

348
00:47:36,727 --> 00:47:38,683
- They've sentenced her.
- To the stake.

349
00:47:38,927 --> 00:47:41,202
- They want to burn her.
- We'll not allow it.

350
00:47:41,447 --> 00:47:43,642
- She has only done good.
- She's no witch.

351
00:47:43,847 --> 00:47:46,645
- They should set her free.
- Yes. Release her.

352
00:47:46,847 --> 00:47:48,326
Shut your mouths!

353
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:51,317
Or you'll go to the tower!

354
00:48:52,567 --> 00:48:53,556
Come.

355
00:48:59,447 --> 00:49:01,642
Your sister have freed you.

356
00:49:01,927 --> 00:49:05,476
But now she stands
on the verge of death.

357
00:49:05,727 --> 00:49:07,126
ln particular...

358
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:12,401
since she has been
convicted of sorcery
and deallngs with evil spirits,...

359
00:49:12,647 --> 00:49:17,323
she shall by the
power of a sentence
from the high ecclesiastical court...

360
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:20,843
be punished with death by the fire.

361
00:49:46,247 --> 00:49:48,795
And your decision stands, prince?

362
00:49:49,647 --> 00:49:51,319
Here's the document.

363
00:49:51,727 --> 00:49:55,686
You actually want to resign
the throne, brother? Outrageous!

364
00:49:55,927 --> 00:49:58,600
l've convicted an innocent to death.

365
00:49:58,847 --> 00:50:00,803
l don't want to be a
distant judge over a people.

366
00:50:01,047 --> 00:50:02,924
You've only done
what the law requires.

367
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:06,318
The law may say that she's
guilty a thousand times.

368
00:50:06,567 --> 00:50:08,239
My heart tells me, ...

369
00:50:09,167 --> 00:50:10,919
that she was innocent.

370
00:50:18,927 --> 00:50:21,202
Hand over the horse, peasant!

371
00:50:21,647 --> 00:50:23,638
It won't be to your loss.

372
00:50:23,927 --> 00:50:26,282
Run, brothers!
As fast as your legs allow!

373
00:50:26,567 --> 00:50:29,923
- l'll ride on ahead.
- You have to save her.

374
00:50:53,727 --> 00:50:56,275
Look.
The zealot hovers the arm.

375
00:50:56,727 --> 00:51:00,197
That's the sign to light the woodpile.

376
00:51:01,447 --> 00:51:02,436
So.

377
00:51:03,247 --> 00:51:04,646
The poor thing.

378
00:51:18,247 --> 00:51:19,396
Stop!

379
00:51:26,167 --> 00:51:28,044
- Stop!
- Stop!

380
00:51:33,327 --> 00:51:35,204
Sister, dear sister.

381
00:51:36,047 --> 00:51:39,403
lt's us. Your brothers.
You've freed us.

382
00:51:53,647 --> 00:51:54,921
What are you saying?

383
00:51:55,167 --> 00:51:58,239
- Her brothers freed her.
- She got her children back.

384
00:51:58,447 --> 00:51:59,926
- There they come.
- Who?

385
00:52:00,167 --> 00:52:01,236
- Her brothers.
- Where?

386
00:52:01,447 --> 00:52:04,041
- There.
- Make way, make way!

387
00:52:04,247 --> 00:52:05,396
The prince comes.

388
00:52:21,727 --> 00:52:23,206
So, you donkey.

389
00:52:23,847 --> 00:52:26,202
Didn't l tell you?
Or what?

390
00:52:26,727 --> 00:52:29,002
Didn't l teIl you all along.

391
00:52:29,447 --> 00:52:31,244
What did you tell me, jester?

392
00:52:31,447 --> 00:52:34,917
That she's as innocent
as you're stupid.

393
00:52:36,327 --> 00:52:38,477
Do you perhaps still doubt?

394
00:52:39,647 --> 00:52:40,523
You,...

395
00:52:40,927 --> 00:52:42,724
that is now dangerous.

396
00:52:44,727 --> 00:52:46,206
The jester is right.

397
00:52:46,447 --> 00:52:50,918
- The jester is always right.
- Yes, now you get it. That's right.

398
00:52:51,167 --> 00:52:56,560
But if it had gone according to your
will, then she would
no longer be alive.

399
00:52:56,727 --> 00:52:58,399
You keep quiet now.

400
00:52:58,847 --> 00:53:03,796
The prince will be entering shortly.
Then no one in his
entourage may err.

401
00:53:06,247 --> 00:53:11,116
The End

402
00:53:17,847 --> 00:53:18,996
End of third act
