1
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:14,013
There is only one option.

2
00:02:18,658 --> 00:02:19,750
Abortion.

3
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,788
Are you mad Sia?

4
00:02:22,428 --> 00:02:24,020
What.. what.. what nonsense is this?

5
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:24,892
Do you have any other solution?

6
00:02:24,997 --> 00:02:25,929
But why do you always
look for a solution?

7
00:02:26,032 --> 00:02:27,192
Because l need a solution!

8
00:02:29,936 --> 00:02:31,904
l know, let us get married.

9
00:02:36,309 --> 00:02:37,333
Okay.

10
00:02:39,245 --> 00:02:43,147
Look, Rags l don't
want to pressurise you..

11
00:02:43,249 --> 00:02:46,241
..but your results are
going to come in 15-20 days.

12
00:02:46,786 --> 00:02:50,916
No, you are right Sia.
We should get married.

13
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:56,758
And your parents?
- Don't worry about them..

14
00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:01,323
l will go home tomorrow.

15
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:28,217
Chandrasheel.

16
00:03:28,327 --> 00:03:30,056
Yes sir, Please sit.

17
00:03:52,018 --> 00:03:53,542
Take a left from ahead.

18
00:03:59,926 --> 00:04:01,826
Say something sir.

19
00:04:05,464 --> 00:04:08,160
Now you are really
driving me bananas..

20
00:04:09,368 --> 00:04:14,135
..l told you clearly l don't want
to get my son married this year.

21
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,104
Come here.

22
00:04:16,075 --> 00:04:18,703
lf you could take a look
at the girls photo once.

23
00:04:18,811 --> 00:04:21,905
What's this, eh? Want to cut my ears?

24
00:04:22,348 --> 00:04:25,283
Go way, keep the water heated

25
00:04:28,087 --> 00:04:29,554
What is the point in
seeing the photograph?

26
00:04:29,622 --> 00:04:32,819
We will show you the girl,
if you want.

27
00:04:33,693 --> 00:04:37,789
Mister, can't you
understand Hindi, l told you once..

28
00:04:37,897 --> 00:04:40,229
..l don't want to get my son
married this year. No means No!

29
00:04:40,866 --> 00:04:42,026
That's all.

30
00:04:45,338 --> 00:04:49,399
Greetings father.
- Bless you.

31
00:04:49,508 --> 00:04:50,668
How did you come so suddenly?

32
00:04:50,743 --> 00:04:51,835
l had some work in Patna..

33
00:04:51,944 --> 00:04:53,309
..so l thought of
coming home for a day.

34
00:04:53,546 --> 00:04:56,879
Go, go, go wash up l am coming.
- Yes.

35
00:04:59,885 --> 00:05:01,819
He has come only for a day..

36
00:05:02,321 --> 00:05:05,188
..otherwise l would have
asked him to see the girl.

37
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:10,990
Why are you pestering me?
Do l have any compulsion?

38
00:05:12,531 --> 00:05:14,362
Everyday someone or the
other keeps coming for you.

39
00:05:14,467 --> 00:05:15,957
lt's fine mother.

40
00:05:16,268 --> 00:05:19,931
l am tired of making
tea and snacks for them.

41
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,937
Look son, now even
l want you to get married.

42
00:05:24,043 --> 00:05:26,739
Mother please, please,

43
00:05:26,846 --> 00:05:27,904
Just wait.

44
00:05:28,114 --> 00:05:31,083
Laxmi, bring the photo.
- Yes ma'am

45
00:05:31,684 --> 00:05:32,378
Which photo?

46
00:05:32,485 --> 00:05:34,112
First see and then tell me.

47
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:40,851
Look.

48
00:05:41,894 --> 00:05:44,328
Though your father does not like any.

49
00:05:45,765 --> 00:05:47,926
lf you like anyone, then tell me.

50
00:05:48,601 --> 00:05:49,465
What mother!

51
00:05:49,568 --> 00:05:50,762
Have a look.

52
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:54,200
Ma'am, the cooking is done.

53
00:05:55,241 --> 00:05:56,367
l will just come.

54
00:05:56,575 --> 00:05:58,167
What will you have for breakfast?

55
00:06:19,632 --> 00:06:21,031
Did you like anyone?

56
00:06:22,168 --> 00:06:23,567
Who is she?

57
00:06:25,738 --> 00:06:27,069
Sia.

58
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,630
Whose daughter is she?

59
00:06:30,109 --> 00:06:31,303
Sampuran Singh's.

60
00:06:31,644 --> 00:06:33,009
She was with me in college.

61
00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:35,110
ls she from Delhi?

62
00:06:35,748 --> 00:06:37,181
Punjabi !

63
00:06:39,885 --> 00:06:44,720
Look Sir, it is very difficult
to find good girls these days.

64
00:06:45,424 --> 00:06:48,587
Listen, once my son
becomes an l.A.S officer..

65
00:06:48,894 --> 00:06:50,691
..then there will be many.

66
00:06:51,063 --> 00:06:57,400
l am ready for 2-3 millions even now.

67
00:06:58,537 --> 00:07:00,801
You are getting annoyed sir.

68
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,133
No, what's there to get annoyed.

69
00:07:03,576 --> 00:07:06,704
What did you think, l will start
dancing hearing of 2-3 million?

70
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:09,006
lf you say, l will
increase some more..

71
00:07:09,115 --> 00:07:12,016
What is this?
Why this cheap haggling?

72
00:07:13,119 --> 00:07:14,643
Now please let me go, this is enough.

73
00:07:14,854 --> 00:07:18,187
My son has come only for a day,
so please. Goodbye.

74
00:07:18,524 --> 00:07:19,513
Please leave.

75
00:07:20,059 --> 00:07:21,458
Since how long has
this been going on?

76
00:07:22,895 --> 00:07:23,987
Since 4 years.

77
00:07:25,998 --> 00:07:29,161
And all this while you
never got the time to tell me.

78
00:07:35,741 --> 00:07:37,140
What are you thinking now?

79
00:07:39,278 --> 00:07:40,836
What will you tell him?

80
00:07:44,049 --> 00:07:45,949
Please why don't you talk to father.

81
00:07:46,652 --> 00:07:49,348
l don't know how to..

82
00:08:14,814 --> 00:08:18,181
And if your father doesn't agree?

83
00:08:18,484 --> 00:08:20,076
Then l will have to listen to him.

84
00:08:20,786 --> 00:08:21,946
Seriously.

85
00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:25,919
Sia, Sia, look at me.

86
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:27,691
l love you, okay.

87
00:08:27,893 --> 00:08:30,828
And l can fight not just my
father but the entire world, for you.

88
00:08:35,668 --> 00:08:38,637
When are your results
for the civil services out?

89
00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:41,538
ln 10-15 days.

90
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:44,401
You will make it, won't you?

91
00:08:56,655 --> 00:08:58,850
l have a friend Mr. Jagdish.

92
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:03,224
He is a very big man,
a rich man of our area.

93
00:09:03,729 --> 00:09:05,788
He has a lot of business.

94
00:09:06,432 --> 00:09:09,492
He has 4 cold storages,
2 houses in Patna.

95
00:09:10,436 --> 00:09:13,371
He has a daughter, she
is educated and cultured..

96
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:20,579
And the best part,
she is the only child.

97
00:09:25,184 --> 00:09:27,015
Do you understand what l am saying?

98
00:09:29,488 --> 00:09:32,651
She will be best for
you in every respect.

99
00:09:33,092 --> 00:09:36,687
She won't roam around in
pants like Delhi girl.

100
00:09:38,364 --> 00:09:41,060
Not all girls in
Delhi are same, father.

101
00:09:43,202 --> 00:09:48,572
Don't try and tell me,
about Delhi girls !

102
00:09:49,174 --> 00:09:51,608
l have not greyed my
hair in the sun, son!

00:09:52,144 --> 00:09:54,009
l understand everything,
what all happens.

104
00:09:58,183 --> 00:10:00,117
Anyway forget whatever happened.

105
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,850
You will marry Mr.
Jagdish's daughter..

106
00:10:03,956 --> 00:10:05,753
..l have promised him.

107
00:10:08,961 --> 00:10:10,724
Even l've promised someone.

108
00:10:10,996 --> 00:10:12,156
You have promised someone?

109
00:10:12,431 --> 00:10:15,798
..what standing do you
have to make a promise!

110
00:10:16,101 --> 00:10:17,625
What do you think of yourself?

111
00:10:18,804 --> 00:10:21,170
All the fun n' frolic that
you are having in Delhi..

112
00:10:21,273 --> 00:10:24,140
..the motorcycle, the
roaming around here and there..

113
00:10:24,243 --> 00:10:26,643
..you are doing it on
your father's money!

114
00:10:27,079 --> 00:10:29,775
Don't forget that!

115
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:32,845
The food is served.

116
00:10:33,218 --> 00:10:34,685
Promise my foot !

117
00:10:35,454 --> 00:10:36,716
Come on, let's have food.

118
00:10:51,704 --> 00:10:52,932
What is this?

119
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,399
Don't you have to just
wait for the results?

120
00:10:59,545 --> 00:11:01,376
lf you could stay
for a few more days.

121
00:11:06,085 --> 00:11:08,986
What ever happens l'm
the one who suffers!

122
00:11:13,025 --> 00:11:16,552
Raghu, l am talking to you my son.

123
00:11:19,031 --> 00:11:21,522
Will there be a calamity if
you stay back for 2 more days?

124
00:11:23,402 --> 00:11:24,460
Yes.

125
00:11:30,309 --> 00:11:32,243
Bye..
- Bless you.

126
00:11:48,627 --> 00:11:49,992
Grab him! Grab him!

127
00:11:50,095 --> 00:11:55,123
Who are you? Leave me! Leave me!

128
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,189
Put him inside!

129
00:11:56,301 --> 00:12:00,635
Lallan, inject him,
inject him quickly - Leave me!

130
00:12:07,613 --> 00:12:11,515
Where are you, Veer's mother?

131
00:12:12,851 --> 00:12:14,546
Where's my tea?

132
00:12:16,388 --> 00:12:18,879
Where is your son,
is he still bathing?

133
00:12:23,262 --> 00:12:24,593
He left.

134
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:28,222
Left ? .. have you gone mad?

135
00:12:28,767 --> 00:12:29,392
Where did he go?

136
00:12:29,601 --> 00:12:30,863
Why didn't you wake me up?

137
00:12:32,938 --> 00:12:34,906
He didn't even tell me.

138
00:12:35,307 --> 00:12:36,934
When l woke up in the
morning he was gone..

139
00:12:37,042 --> 00:12:38,907
Now don't lie to me.

140
00:12:39,678 --> 00:12:41,077
Why will l lie?

141
00:12:41,713 --> 00:12:44,773
Because you only have pampered him!

142
00:12:45,884 --> 00:12:48,819
lt is the mother and son's
conspiracy, don't l understand!

143
00:12:49,221 --> 00:12:50,518
Jagdish sir, is coming today.

144
00:12:51,056 --> 00:12:52,023
How will l face him now?

145
00:12:52,357 --> 00:12:54,348
He was coming
especially to meet Veer!

146
00:12:55,127 --> 00:12:56,754
You are a stupid woman!

147
00:12:57,296 --> 00:12:58,320
Hell with you!

148
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,715
Stop, stop, Stop.

00:13:26,391 --> 00:13:27,380
Mehfooz, get him down.

151
00:13:31,897 --> 00:13:33,387
Careful.. he shouldn't get hurt.

00:13:36,702 --> 00:13:39,034
Come on fast.. come on.

You keep a lot of money.

173
00:16:54,866 --> 00:16:56,959
So handsome don't you want to go?

Let me go!

188
00:19:13,772 --> 00:19:14,966
Don't stare .

189
00:19:26,384 --> 00:19:29,251
Told you, lower your eyes.

190
00:19:29,588 --> 00:19:31,818
Always keep it low in
front of the master.

191
00:19:45,403 --> 00:19:48,167
So handsome are you hungry?

192
00:19:58,917 --> 00:20:00,282
Didn't l tell you to eat?

193
00:21:27,305 --> 00:21:28,169
l knew it.

194
00:21:30,442 --> 00:21:31,636
So ! you finally ate !

195
00:22:14,886 --> 00:22:17,787
Hello.
- This is Sia speaking.

196
00:22:18,857 --> 00:22:21,382
Can l talk to Raghuveer?

197
00:22:22,227 --> 00:22:24,286
Stop acting?
- What?

198
00:22:24,829 --> 00:22:29,960
l know the ways of girls like you!

199
00:22:30,268 --> 00:22:32,668
But l..
- Keep quiet, listen to me!

200
00:22:34,539 --> 00:22:37,599
lf you desire men so much,
open a brothel..

201
00:22:37,709 --> 00:22:40,507
..all your desires will be fulfilled!

202
00:22:41,579 --> 00:22:46,778
And don't you dare
call at my home again..

203
00:23:00,665 --> 00:23:04,567
Come on .. move..

204
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,627
How are you my son?

205
00:23:32,831 --> 00:23:34,196
Why have you kidnapped me?

206
00:23:34,532 --> 00:23:38,992
Kidnap? Who told you
that l got you kidnapped?

207
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:41,167
l have only invited you.

208
00:23:41,673 --> 00:23:43,163
Like this, in this way.

209
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:46,309
What else could l have done,
l was helpless..

210
00:23:46,845 --> 00:23:49,871
..your father wouldn't
have allowed otherwise..

211
00:23:51,149 --> 00:23:53,617
He acts like a lord,
now he will know.

212
00:23:53,718 --> 00:23:55,447
Look, if you have any
enmity with my father..

213
00:23:55,553 --> 00:23:57,783
..then settle it with him,
why are you dragging me in-between?

214
00:23:58,223 --> 00:24:00,157
My l.A.S. results
are going to come out!

215
00:24:00,358 --> 00:24:03,816
No son, l don't have any
enmity with your father..

216
00:24:03,928 --> 00:24:05,293
..Mr. Madhukar.

217
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:11,468
But he should realise that
other people have self respect too.

218
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:13,965
Now he will know.

219
00:24:14,472 --> 00:24:16,770
Anyway.. now you take rest.

220
00:24:17,008 --> 00:24:19,602
But let me go, why are
you holding me captive.

221
00:24:20,044 --> 00:24:23,138
Why? Didn't you tell him till now?

222
00:24:24,382 --> 00:24:25,440
Where is it?

223
00:24:26,217 --> 00:24:28,617
This Lalatua will
always be a dumb-ass!

224
00:24:32,257 --> 00:24:36,421
Look boy, on the
13th is your marriage.

225
00:24:42,967 --> 00:24:44,559
What nonsense is this?

226
00:24:45,436 --> 00:24:46,903
Oh.. English !

227
00:24:48,807 --> 00:24:50,707
Look sir, you don't understand.

228
00:24:50,942 --> 00:24:52,204
l am already engaged.

229
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:53,402
lf you were engaged..

230
00:24:53,511 --> 00:24:58,676
..then your father wouldn't
be licking Mr. Jagdish's ass!

231
00:25:00,518 --> 00:25:11,087
Son, the girl is beautiful, cultured,
she cooks well, respects her elders..

232
00:25:11,162 --> 00:25:13,790
..what more do you want, tell me?

233
00:25:14,032 --> 00:25:15,966
This is crazy!

234
00:25:17,769 --> 00:25:19,999
Where are you going,
my girlfriend is pregnant..

235
00:25:20,104 --> 00:25:23,096
No matter what you do,
l will not agree to this marriage.

236
00:25:23,174 --> 00:25:24,869
You cannot force me like this.

237
00:25:25,777 --> 00:25:27,836
Please let me go.

238
00:25:28,446 --> 00:25:33,383
guard, remember two things.

239
00:25:33,885 --> 00:25:36,479
Don't hit the boy on his face.

240
00:25:37,422 --> 00:25:39,788
The marriage photo won't look good.

241
00:25:40,225 --> 00:25:41,453
Leave me.

242
00:25:43,528 --> 00:25:44,825
Leave me.

243
00:25:44,929 --> 00:25:51,835
Hey Laltu, don't let the boy sleep,
not even a minute, understood?

244
00:25:52,637 --> 00:25:53,763
Leave me.

245
00:25:53,872 --> 00:25:55,032
Leave me.

246
00:26:12,323 --> 00:26:14,518
What did you do! You kidnapped him!

247
00:26:14,626 --> 00:26:15,923
No need to shriek.

248
00:26:16,027 --> 00:26:19,554
What was the need for you to
do all this, it is illegal.

249
00:26:19,898 --> 00:26:21,923
Now you will teach me the law!

250
00:26:22,267 --> 00:26:24,497
l don't understand..
- lf you don't understand..

251
00:26:24,569 --> 00:26:26,662
..then don't blabber.

252
00:26:26,871 --> 00:26:28,168
Do as l say.

253
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:31,267
Look, just once..

254
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,514
Listen to me carefully.

255
00:26:38,216 --> 00:26:41,117
There is no need to
tell Janki anything.

256
00:26:43,488 --> 00:26:46,389
l will talk to her
myself in the evening.

257
00:26:46,758 --> 00:26:48,658
Ask her not to go
to college any more.

258
00:26:50,228 --> 00:26:51,286
Where is Janki?

259
00:26:51,663 --> 00:26:54,496
Queen of my dreams, sweet Anju.

260
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,130
Lots of love.

261
00:26:56,601 --> 00:27:00,697
Am writing with my blood,
don't think it is ink.

262
00:27:00,805 --> 00:27:04,832
Am dying for your love,
don't think l am alive.

263
00:27:05,543 --> 00:27:08,535
Your husband turned out to
be a poet. - Future husband.

264
00:27:08,646 --> 00:27:09,578
lt is the same thing.

265
00:27:09,681 --> 00:27:10,807
Read further.

266
00:27:11,783 --> 00:27:14,946
l miss you all the
time specially at nights

267
00:27:15,053 --> 00:27:17,851
Don't ask about the nights.

268
00:27:20,224 --> 00:27:22,784
Now even l am waiting for the D day.

269
00:27:22,894 --> 00:27:24,725
Janki.
- Coming.

270
00:27:25,596 --> 00:27:27,587

Sit down.
- What is the matter, mother.

273

Sit down.

274
00:27:39,043 --> 00:27:40,840
Mother, l am getting late.

275
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:54,458
Janki, your father does not
want you to go to college..

276
00:27:55,126 --> 00:27:58,391
Why?
- l don't know.

277
00:27:58,863 --> 00:28:00,023
Ask him.

278
00:28:00,465 --> 00:28:03,025
But there must be something..
- l said ask him.

279
00:28:04,802 --> 00:28:08,238
l told you what he
asked me.. that's all.

280
00:28:10,008 --> 00:28:12,101
Mother, won't you tell me.

281
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:14,610
Will l get my tea today or not!?

282
00:28:51,816 --> 00:28:54,876
What happened ! You
didn't go to college today?

283
00:28:56,788 --> 00:28:58,346
Father's orders!

284
00:29:00,625 --> 00:29:02,490
Today's chemistry practical was so..

285
00:29:05,396 --> 00:29:08,524
Sister-in-law, you know
what's the matter? Don't you

286
00:29:10,701 --> 00:29:13,693
Sister-in-law, tell me.
- lt is nothing.

287
00:29:13,805 --> 00:29:15,500
Look sister-in-law, cross your
heart and say it's nothing .

288
00:29:16,507 --> 00:29:17,940
Tell me. Please.

289
00:29:28,019 --> 00:29:31,250
Has your father ever listened to me ?

290
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:36,485
What do you think l
like what he is doing ?

291
00:29:37,862 --> 00:29:39,955
Mother, tell me one thing.

292
00:29:40,064 --> 00:29:43,295
ln today's time how can you
force some one to get married..

293
00:29:47,171 --> 00:29:51,665
Sister-in-law, why don't you
talk to my brother. Explain him.

294
00:29:52,076 --> 00:29:55,273
Janki, may be the boy is really good.

295
00:29:55,646 --> 00:29:57,944
And he may start liking
you after the marriage.

296
00:29:58,683 --> 00:29:59,911
And what if he doesn't ?

297
00:30:00,017 --> 00:30:02,679
Don't say that.

298
00:30:02,787 --> 00:30:06,245
l don't care, l will never
marry this way, that's final.

299
00:30:06,457 --> 00:30:08,550
So Mr. Groom, yes or no?

300
00:30:08,826 --> 00:30:14,822
8.. 9.. 10..

301
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,161
What you say now.

302
00:30:20,304 --> 00:30:21,464
Come dear.

303
00:30:27,678 --> 00:30:29,305
Come.. sit here.

304
00:30:34,285 --> 00:30:38,346
You must be thinking, what

305
00:30:38,923 --> 00:30:40,720
..why has he stopped my college?

306
00:30:41,092 --> 00:30:42,320
lsn't it?

307
00:30:44,929 --> 00:30:48,888
Dear, whatever the parents do..

308
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,594
..it is for the
betterment of the children.

309
00:30:52,036 --> 00:30:54,903
lsn't it? Yes or no?

310
00:30:55,806 --> 00:30:56,795
Yes.

00:30:59,243 --> 00:31:01,905
l have found a very nice boy for you.

312
00:31:03,581 --> 00:31:09,144
Educated, cultured. That's why we
have to do everything in a haste?

313
00:31:09,687 --> 00:31:10,711
lts fine, isn't it?

314
00:31:13,024 --> 00:31:15,822
You do know, whatever l will do..

315
00:31:15,927 --> 00:31:18,555
..it will be for your better future.

316
00:31:19,363 --> 00:31:22,298
She is afraid that,
by forced marriage..

317
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,028
Forced, who said forced?

318
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:27,235
But that boy.. - lf you
don't know the entire thing..

319
00:31:27,338 --> 00:31:28,930
..then don't speak in between.

320
00:31:32,443 --> 00:31:37,005
She is talking nonsense,
no one is being forced.

321
00:31:37,848 --> 00:31:40,214
The boy is ready for the marriage.

322
00:32:03,774 --> 00:32:06,641
What happened?

323
00:32:14,619 --> 00:32:15,813

Why, want to buy something or what?

327
00:33:11,842 --> 00:33:16,302
The way you are getting
Janki married, is that right?

328
00:33:18,316 --> 00:33:23,015
l mean, will she be happy?

329
00:33:24,522 --> 00:33:28,288
So you think , only you care for her?

330
00:33:30,094 --> 00:33:32,995
No, l was saying because..

331
00:33:33,931 --> 00:33:35,796
Your uncle's daughter's marriage..

332
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,367

And then Mr. Tiwari's
daughter's marriage.

00:33:43,607 --> 00:33:44,801
Both of them are happy, isn't it?

335
00:33:45,776 --> 00:33:47,607

Tiwari's daughter..

336
00:33:48,579 --> 00:33:51,207
..but sister Guddi is
not happy. l know that.

337
00:33:52,083 --> 00:33:55,519
Look, l don't want
that our dear Janki..

00:36:11,322 --> 00:36:12,584
Do you want to get thrashed again?

358
00:36:22,867 --> 00:36:25,097
Why are you awake ? Go to sleep.

359
00:36:28,606 --> 00:36:31,871
lt has been 7 days
since he has gone..

360
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:34,944
..he has still not called.

361
00:36:35,846 --> 00:36:42,376
l know.. he is doing it purposely..

362
00:36:43,888 --> 00:36:46,049
..so that we are tensed about him.

363
00:36:48,092 --> 00:36:50,356
You are getting worried here..

364
00:36:51,061 --> 00:36:54,326
..and he is roaming around
with that girl in Delhi.

365
00:36:57,601 --> 00:36:59,262
Go to sleep Now.

366
00:37:01,939 --> 00:37:04,407
He was saying that
the girl is very nice.

367
00:37:05,342 --> 00:37:07,310
of course why will he not say that..

368
00:37:11,181 --> 00:37:13,115
Raghu really likes her.

369
00:37:14,451 --> 00:37:16,419
So what if he likes her?

370
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,121
Even l liked a lot of
things when l was young

371
00:37:20,558 --> 00:37:23,288
but what did l eventually get ?

372
00:37:24,161 --> 00:37:25,150
Duck-egg!

373
00:37:25,563 --> 00:37:27,793
l know everything, what he likes.

374
00:37:27,998 --> 00:37:30,489
Sleep quietly, don't make me mad now

375
00:37:33,337 --> 00:37:36,431
There is something
that you don't know about

376
00:37:39,543 --> 00:37:44,173
She is pregnant.. from Raghu!

377
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:30,889
Hail king Ram, Sita-Ram.

378
00:38:31,929 --> 00:38:38,129
Hail king Ram, Sita-Ram.

379
00:38:40,871 --> 00:38:45,740
Hail king Ram, Sita-Ram.

380
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:50,669
Hail king Ram, Sita-Ram.

381
00:39:07,364 --> 00:39:10,595
So, your marriage has been
fixed and you didn't even tell us.

382
00:39:10,934 --> 00:39:12,834
Will you stop
studying after marriage?

383
00:39:17,441 --> 00:39:20,103
What happened? ls everything fine?

384
00:39:22,212 --> 00:39:25,773
My brother was saying, that
your groom has been locked up..

385
00:39:25,849 --> 00:39:27,180
..they are even beating him up.

386
00:39:28,686 --> 00:39:30,711
Janki, Janki.

387
00:39:48,706 --> 00:39:50,367
He is very stubborn.

388
00:39:51,909 --> 00:39:52,876
He won't understand like this.

389
00:39:52,976 --> 00:39:54,466
He is thick skinned.

390
00:40:04,288 --> 00:40:05,653
l will answer it.

391
00:40:11,462 --> 00:40:14,920
Sunil, how are you?

392
00:40:17,501 --> 00:40:20,902
He got through, l knew it.

393
00:40:21,205 --> 00:40:24,402
Listen, Veer got through the exams.

394
00:40:26,276 --> 00:40:27,743

What happened?
- Just a minute.

398
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:40,982
When did he leave?

399
00:40:41,558 --> 00:40:43,958
He left the very
next day of his arrival.

400
00:40:44,361 --> 00:40:46,261
Tell me, what happened.

401
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:47,058
Just a minute.

402
00:40:47,498 --> 00:40:48,590
He didn't reach Delhi!

403
00:40:49,099 --> 00:40:51,090
lf he didn't reach Delhi,
then where is he gone?

404
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:56,132
The boy looks like a hero.

405
00:40:57,641 --> 00:40:59,632
Did he run away to Bombay or what?

406
00:41:00,711 --> 00:41:04,272
On which date did your son leave?
- On the 26th.

407
00:41:04,715 --> 00:41:06,876
And you are lodging
a complaint today.

408
00:41:07,785 --> 00:41:10,811
As l told you.. we
thought that he is in Delhi.

409
00:41:11,121 --> 00:41:13,282
When did you know
that he is not in Delhi?

410
00:41:13,891 --> 00:41:16,485
Today, will you lodge
the complaint or not?

411
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,591

412
00:41:19,029 --> 00:41:21,122
Bring the FlR book.

413
00:41:33,744 --> 00:41:35,177
Don't you understand?

414
00:41:36,213 --> 00:41:37,441
Why can't you understand?

415
00:41:37,681 --> 00:41:38,943
Do you enjoy being thrashed up?

416
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,612
Come master.

417
00:41:44,721 --> 00:41:53,026
The Prince has come from heaven

418
00:41:53,463 --> 00:42:01,768
Has come to take you away with him.

419
00:42:02,506 --> 00:42:06,408
The forest green veil.

420
00:42:06,543 --> 00:42:10,536
The golden yellow gown.

421
00:42:11,048 --> 00:42:18,853
And where will l get
the nose ring from?

422
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:26,721
They are so costly.

423
00:42:27,331 --> 00:42:36,239
l will marry him,
live on morsels too.

424
00:42:36,773 --> 00:42:37,569
What are you doing?

425
00:42:37,674 --> 00:42:38,834
You scoundrel, what are you doing?

426
00:42:39,109 --> 00:42:40,474
Through happiness
and sorrow, my love.

427
00:42:41,912 --> 00:42:42,571
Quiet!

428
00:43:22,653 --> 00:43:23,950
Everything will be fine.

429
00:43:26,223 --> 00:43:27,884
You are looking very pretty.

430
00:43:30,761 --> 00:43:35,027
Come, let's see you smile.

431
00:43:37,668 --> 00:43:41,934
Now you are looking
like a real groom.

432
00:43:42,039 --> 00:43:44,098
So handsome.

433
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,108
Very nice.

434
00:43:52,716 --> 00:43:53,876

Drink it..

437
00:45:47,097 --> 00:45:51,033
My youth is of no use
without you, my darling.

438
00:45:51,134 --> 00:45:54,968
My youth is of no use
without you, my darling.

439

This is my story, my darling.

My youth is of no use

00:46:15,058 --> 00:46:19,654
This is my story, my darling.

445
00:46:29,873 --> 00:46:33,809
My beloved is so naive.

446
00:46:33,910 --> 00:46:37,607
My beloved is so naive.

447
00:46:37,714 --> 00:46:41,548
And so shy of me.

448
00:46:41,651 --> 00:46:47,214
l told him, come slowly,
come close to me.

449
00:46:48,225 --> 00:46:52,161
My youth is of no use
without you, my darling.

Why are you making me cry?
Come close to me.

00:47:05,709 --> 00:47:07,734
My youth is of no use

00:47:07,844 --> 00:47:10,813
This is my story, my darling.

455
00:47:22,726 --> 00:47:26,958
The nights are very restless l
lay awake counting the stars.

456
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:30,659
The nights are very restless l
lay awake counting the stars.

457
00:47:30,767 --> 00:47:39,607
With tears in my eyes l say,
darling please come to me now.

This is my story, my darling.

464

Laltu!

465
00:49:23,513 --> 00:49:26,038
Laltu!.. Laltu!

466
00:49:49,406 --> 00:49:52,136
You bastards!

467
00:50:00,784 --> 00:50:01,751
Dear..

468
00:50:05,655 --> 00:50:09,989
So, how did my
sister-in-law like her groom?

469
00:50:13,330 --> 00:50:15,696
ln one day only you have
even learnt how to blush!

470
00:50:16,666 --> 00:50:18,327
Tell me, how did you like him?

471
00:50:19,269 --> 00:50:20,258
He is nice,

472
00:50:21,738 --> 00:50:25,572
thank god, l am relieved
to see you smile like this!

473
00:50:26,009 --> 00:50:28,341
Will l get my tea today?

474
00:50:29,612 --> 00:50:30,738
Coming.

475
00:54:24,538 --> 00:54:26,062
You know.
- What?

476
00:54:27,007 --> 00:54:29,066
l think we should get married.

477
00:54:29,476 --> 00:54:32,206
Brilliant idea,
but there is a small problem.

478
00:54:32,479 --> 00:54:33,969
Who will marry us?

479
00:54:35,082 --> 00:54:36,174
What happened?

480
00:54:36,450 --> 00:54:38,748
Excuse me Mr. Raghuveer Sahi.
- You are excused.

481
00:54:39,153 --> 00:54:41,053
You should be worrying
about that and not me.

482
00:54:41,155 --> 00:54:43,316
Whenever l want, there
will be a long queue for me.

483
00:54:43,524 --> 00:54:46,755
Oh! Where are they?
- Sia... Sia...

484
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:47,918
What should l do...

485
00:54:48,028 --> 00:54:50,428
You do whatever you want,
l have to leave.

486
00:54:50,697 --> 00:54:52,995
Sia... Sia... Come here...

487
00:54:53,767 --> 00:54:55,462
Before leaving... tell me something.

488
00:54:58,105 --> 00:54:59,367
One second.

489
00:55:03,844 --> 00:55:05,835
Sia, will you marry me?

490
00:55:40,447 --> 00:55:41,414
What is it?

491
00:55:44,418 --> 00:55:47,910
Listen.
- Leave my hand, leave my hand.

492
00:55:49,890 --> 00:55:51,517
Why are you behaving like this?

493
00:55:52,392 --> 00:55:53,552
Ask your father.

494
00:56:20,187 --> 00:56:23,156
Singh sir, we enjoyed a lot.

495
00:56:23,557 --> 00:56:29,723
great food, great drinks,
and what a dance.

496
00:56:29,930 --> 00:56:34,424
My youth is of no use
without you, my darling.

497
00:56:36,570 --> 00:56:38,902
l have never seen such a dance.

498
00:56:39,006 --> 00:56:43,033
We had paid 11,000 rupees.

499
00:56:43,243 --> 00:56:46,838
That's fine, but how
much did you splurge on her.

500
00:56:47,114 --> 00:56:50,481
Lawyer sir splurged 50,000 on her.

501
00:56:51,718 --> 00:56:53,811
Come, come Mr. Sharma.

502
00:56:54,454 --> 00:56:55,716
We all were remembering you...

503
00:56:55,822 --> 00:56:57,414
...so l thought that
l should call you.

504
00:56:58,058 --> 00:56:59,116
Sit down please.

505
00:56:59,493 --> 00:57:03,361
Jagarnath! Get the fish.

506
00:57:05,132 --> 00:57:06,497
Just a minute.

507
00:57:18,312 --> 00:57:20,576
l didn't understand
one thing Singh sir...

508
00:57:20,681 --> 00:57:22,114
When you have so much money?

509
00:57:22,216 --> 00:57:24,741
why did you kidnap the boy?

510
00:57:24,851 --> 00:57:28,810
But Singh sir saved all of his money.

511
00:57:31,191 --> 00:57:35,821
What is money and wealth?
lt is transient.

512
00:57:37,164 --> 00:57:39,394
lt comes, it goes.

513
00:57:40,267 --> 00:57:43,896
For me, the biggest thing is honour.

514
00:57:45,305 --> 00:57:49,139
Sometimes, for your honour...

515
00:57:50,244 --> 00:57:52,644
...you have to put your life on risk.

516
00:57:52,879 --> 00:57:55,643
Great Mahender sir, great.

517
00:57:56,383 --> 00:57:59,352
For your honour.
You risked your daughter's life.

518
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:04,214
No one's life is at risk,
both are living together...

519
00:58:04,291 --> 00:58:05,883
everything will be fine

520
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:10,121
...let us have
another peg on that note.

521
00:58:17,037 --> 00:58:20,404
Hello... can l talk to D. G sir?

522
00:58:22,009 --> 00:58:23,772
This is Madhukar Sahi speaking.

523
00:58:24,978 --> 00:58:26,138
Yes.

524
00:58:27,547 --> 00:58:29,344
Greetings sir, Madhukar speaking sir.

525
00:58:30,417 --> 00:58:31,315
Yes sir.

526
00:58:31,685 --> 00:58:36,315
l had talked to the Mr.
Pande, about my case.

527
00:58:37,658 --> 00:58:38,716
Yes sir.

528
00:58:39,326 --> 00:58:40,850
Nothing has happened sir.

529
00:58:41,995 --> 00:58:44,122
There is a lot of
tension in the house sir.

530
00:58:44,464 --> 00:58:46,591
Wife has stopped eating.

531
00:58:48,235 --> 00:58:50,863
Yes sir. Yes sir.

532
00:58:51,438 --> 00:58:54,305
Okay sir. Thank you sir.

533
00:59:02,816 --> 00:59:06,081
My heart has been broken.

534
00:59:06,386 --> 00:59:10,447
Some looter plundered it

535
00:59:10,557 --> 00:59:14,049
Some looter plundered it

536
00:59:14,461 --> 00:59:16,292
Tell me, how are
your nights these days?

537
00:59:18,699 --> 00:59:20,189
ls that only you can think of.

538
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:21,324
Then what?

539
00:59:21,635 --> 00:59:24,195
You are married now,
what else should l ask you?

540
00:59:24,705 --> 00:59:27,469
Ask her, when can we
meet brother-in-law?

541
00:59:27,574 --> 00:59:29,735
Okay, l'll ask that only.

542
00:59:30,043 --> 00:59:31,977
When are you
introducing us to brother-in-law?

543
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:34,104
l want to meet him too.

544
00:59:34,481 --> 00:59:35,573
Can we meet him today?

545
00:59:35,682 --> 00:59:36,808
No dear.

546
00:59:38,085 --> 00:59:39,017
Please sit down.

547
00:59:41,254 --> 00:59:43,119
lt will take sometime to meet him.

548
00:59:46,326 --> 00:59:49,591
Dear, the thing is that...

549
00:59:49,930 --> 00:59:53,991
...the priest has
restricted anyone to meet son-in-law

550
00:59:54,067 --> 00:59:56,501
...for the next 15 days.

551
00:59:57,738 --> 00:59:59,399
Because the auspicious
occasion has not come.

552
01:00:00,107 --> 01:00:05,272
You know that son-in-law is
still living in the outhouse.

553
01:00:06,012 --> 01:00:09,072
He has not even been
brought in the house.

554
01:00:09,583 --> 01:00:12,643
That means we cannot meet him.

555
01:00:12,953 --> 01:00:16,013
meet him the next time
when you come.

556
01:00:16,123 --> 01:00:17,556
l'm in town only,

557
01:00:17,657 --> 01:00:20,285
will meet him when
the priest allows to.

558
01:00:20,394 --> 01:00:21,952
But will surely meet him.

559
01:00:22,763 --> 01:00:24,060
Yes.

560
01:00:26,266 --> 01:00:27,324
Tea.

561
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:07,492
What happened?

562
01:03:10,730 --> 01:03:12,095
What should l do sister-in-law?

563
01:03:12,465 --> 01:03:13,295
What do you mean?

564
01:03:14,868 --> 01:03:16,563
He doesn't even talk to me.

565
01:03:24,311 --> 01:03:28,680
Why don't you do something.
- What?

566
01:03:28,982 --> 01:03:31,075
Anything.
- Anything? But what?

567
01:03:31,585 --> 01:03:32,813
Plead to him, fall at his feet.

568
01:03:32,919 --> 01:03:33,476
Sister-in-law!

569
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:34,479
What sister-in-law?

570
01:03:35,221 --> 01:03:36,051
What sister-in-law?

571
01:03:37,824 --> 01:03:42,557
Look dear, l would have done
anything to save my marriage.

572
01:03:44,698 --> 01:03:45,687
Anything.

573
01:04:03,984 --> 01:04:05,315
lf you want to sleep on the floor...

574
01:04:05,418 --> 01:04:06,282
...sleep comfortably atleast.

575
01:04:06,653 --> 01:04:07,813
You stay away from me!

576
01:04:35,682 --> 01:04:36,649
What is the matter!

577
01:04:38,351 --> 01:04:40,046
You got up so early in the morning?

578
01:04:42,122 --> 01:04:43,783
Have you talked to Janki?

579
01:04:46,226 --> 01:04:49,662
Yes... but why?

580
01:04:54,734 --> 01:04:56,201
ls brother-in-law fine?

581
01:04:58,805 --> 01:05:00,397
Yes, he is fine.

582
01:05:03,476 --> 01:05:05,410
But he doesn't talk to anyone.

583
01:05:09,149 --> 01:05:12,880
l had already told you that...

584
01:05:13,453 --> 01:05:15,478
...you are not doing the right thing.

585
01:05:17,290 --> 01:05:18,951
But in this house, who
listens to the women...

586
01:05:19,025 --> 01:05:20,390
Will l get my tea today?

587
01:06:08,608 --> 01:06:10,473
Stop... stop.

588
01:06:18,418 --> 01:06:19,043
Tea.

589
01:06:24,491 --> 01:06:25,822
l told you stay away from me.

590
01:06:30,830 --> 01:06:31,922
What are you doing?

591
01:06:32,031 --> 01:06:35,125
Why don't you talk to me?

592
01:06:35,235 --> 01:06:36,725
Please leave me. What are you doing?

593
01:06:36,836 --> 01:06:38,394
l didn't want to get married myself.

594
01:06:39,038 --> 01:06:43,134
Now if you don't accept me, then...

595
01:06:43,243 --> 01:06:47,236
Look, l am sorry. Please, sit.

596
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:51,780
Don't say please to me.

597
01:06:58,958 --> 01:07:03,122
Look, l have a girlfriend in Delhi.

598
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:06,093
You do understand girlfriend,
don't you?

599
01:07:06,933 --> 01:07:12,098
l mean, for the past 4 years
we have been staying together.

600
01:07:21,047 --> 01:07:25,416
And... she is pregnant.

601
01:07:25,985 --> 01:07:28,351
And l don't even know
what condition she is in...

602
01:07:29,355 --> 01:07:31,755
And even she doesn't know
what l have gotten into.

603
01:07:32,759 --> 01:07:35,250
Why should l ruin
your life purposely.

604
01:07:40,667 --> 01:07:42,897
Look, you are a nice girl,
intelligent...

605
01:07:43,970 --> 01:07:45,403
...that's why l am telling you.

606
01:07:50,476 --> 01:07:51,602
Oh God!

607
01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:56,978
How is it?
- Good, sir.

608
01:07:58,785 --> 01:07:59,911
Buy 5 kilos of it.

609
01:08:02,088 --> 01:08:04,113
Come, come inspector sir.

610
01:08:04,390 --> 01:08:06,585
Who have you come to
ruin in the market?

611
01:08:06,693 --> 01:08:08,684
l wanted to talk something
important. - Please sit down.

612
01:08:08,928 --> 01:08:10,225
Went to your home first.

613
01:08:13,399 --> 01:08:14,388
Say.

614
01:08:15,001 --> 01:08:18,459
Your son-in-law's father has
become fully active in Patna.

615
01:08:19,639 --> 01:08:21,664
He has approached the DG Police.

616
01:08:23,643 --> 01:08:27,170
But nothing to worry about...
l have suppressed the matter.

617
01:08:29,515 --> 01:08:32,177
ls everything settled in the house?

618
01:08:35,922 --> 01:08:39,881
Sir... everything should
have been settled by now.

619
01:08:42,161 --> 01:08:44,220
The matter has become serious now.

620
01:08:44,597 --> 01:08:46,155
...that's why l was looking for you.

621
01:08:59,078 --> 01:09:00,443
l met the inspector.

622
01:09:03,383 --> 01:09:05,317
The police are
looking for son-in-law.

623
01:09:08,888 --> 01:09:11,015
So now?
- So what?

624
01:09:11,557 --> 01:09:15,653
He was asking if
everything is settled with them.

625
01:09:17,030 --> 01:09:18,463
How long will it take?

626
01:09:21,134 --> 01:09:24,797
How would l know?

627
01:09:25,605 --> 01:09:28,039
l cannot ask Janki about this?

628
01:09:28,141 --> 01:09:29,301
Ask her.

629
01:09:29,642 --> 01:09:32,611
Why can't you ask her,
you are her mother?

630
01:09:33,012 --> 01:09:36,448
So what if l am her mother,
how can l ask her that?

631
01:09:36,549 --> 01:09:38,380
Don't give me a lecture.

632
01:09:40,253 --> 01:09:42,721
Explain to her, that
she is married now...

633
01:09:42,822 --> 01:09:45,347
...they are husband and wife.

634
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:49,653
Then why is it taking so long.

635
01:09:52,198 --> 01:09:56,464
Look, the marriage has to be
consummated... as soon as possible.

636
01:09:57,136 --> 01:09:58,103
Understood.

637
01:10:26,265 --> 01:10:28,233
Tell me what is it?

638
01:10:33,573 --> 01:10:35,063
Won't you tell me?

639
01:10:37,710 --> 01:10:38,938
Dear.

640
01:10:45,018 --> 01:10:47,885
lt is not something to
think about so much.

641
01:10:47,987 --> 01:10:49,545
...will you say something?

642
01:10:50,256 --> 01:10:51,814
Have you gone mad?

643
01:10:53,459 --> 01:10:55,256
What is wrong with this?

644
01:10:55,728 --> 01:10:58,288
Let them go out? So
that he can run away!

645
01:10:59,032 --> 01:11:01,523
Will your men do nothing?

646
01:11:02,168 --> 01:11:03,601
Send them along.

647
01:11:05,104 --> 01:11:07,197
Look... don't you want...

648
01:11:07,306 --> 01:11:09,240
...your sister's life to get settled?

649
01:11:11,077 --> 01:11:12,840
Everything becomes fine between them.

650
01:11:13,312 --> 01:11:14,472
Tell me.

651
01:11:16,015 --> 01:11:16,947
Okay.

652
01:11:37,503 --> 01:11:39,334
What is the name of your girlfriend?

653
01:11:45,678 --> 01:11:48,112
Sia.
- Really.

654
01:11:49,115 --> 01:11:51,606
Do you know Janki
and Sia mean the same?

655
01:11:54,654 --> 01:11:57,054
ln this case, there is a lot
of difference between the two

656
01:12:11,104 --> 01:12:14,767
Ramkishen... tie the
calf in the shade.

657
01:12:17,977 --> 01:12:19,535
Laltu!

658
01:12:25,318 --> 01:12:26,546
Did you come from the temple?

659
01:12:35,495 --> 01:12:37,326
What's wrong?

660
01:12:37,930 --> 01:12:38,988
Dear.

661
01:12:44,937 --> 01:12:46,564
Just a minute, listen.

662
01:12:46,973 --> 01:12:48,031
Listen to me.

663
01:12:52,778 --> 01:12:55,747
Dear, what happened?

664
01:12:58,918 --> 01:13:01,250
Sister-in-law, no
matter what we do...

665
01:13:02,255 --> 01:13:04,314
...but he will never accept me!

666
01:13:06,993 --> 01:13:09,484
Look here, look at me.

667
01:13:12,565 --> 01:13:14,897
Don't say that,

668
01:13:16,569 --> 01:13:19,834
Look, everything
will be fine gradually.

669
01:13:21,874 --> 01:13:25,571
just take it from me
nothing will be fine!

670
01:13:58,911 --> 01:14:03,507
Don't say no to her, or else
we will have to force you.

671
01:14:13,859 --> 01:14:16,293
You are very delicate.

672
01:14:21,033 --> 01:14:22,466
He is feeling shy.

673
01:14:22,735 --> 01:14:24,566
Don't you like girls?

674
01:14:24,971 --> 01:14:26,199
What kind of a man are you?

675
01:14:29,242 --> 01:14:32,370
You have been living with a girl
in the room for so many days...

676
01:14:32,445 --> 01:14:34,413
...don't you feel
like doing anything.

677
01:14:34,747 --> 01:14:36,806
l don't think he is capable!

678
01:14:41,020 --> 01:14:42,885
Sir, all this useless talk.

679
01:14:43,522 --> 01:14:45,285
Ask him for what we have called him.

680
01:14:45,358 --> 01:14:49,727
He is intelligent himself,
he lives in Delhi.

681
01:14:50,796 --> 01:14:54,493
You are not doing your duty,
the duty of a husband.

682
01:14:54,867 --> 01:14:56,664
Tell us if you have any problem.

683
01:14:56,736 --> 01:14:58,931
lt can be treated then...

684
01:15:00,740 --> 01:15:01,934
Did you understand?

685
01:15:02,174 --> 01:15:06,201
Tonight if you don't do
anything then you had it...

686
01:15:32,371 --> 01:15:33,463
Listen...

687
01:15:37,543 --> 01:15:38,805
Are you fine?

688
01:15:40,613 --> 01:15:43,275
How many times have
l told you, don't touch me!

689
01:15:54,627 --> 01:15:56,185
You think l am impotent!

690
01:16:04,370 --> 01:16:05,928
ls anyone there?

691
01:16:06,339 --> 01:16:07,363
ls anyone there?

692
01:16:19,185 --> 01:16:21,380
Shout... let me see who comes.

693
01:16:28,694 --> 01:16:30,685
This is what your
father wanted, isn't it?

694
01:16:44,944 --> 01:16:46,605
Leave me! Leave me!

695
01:16:56,288 --> 01:16:57,380
No!

696
01:17:47,339 --> 01:17:48,203
Dear.

697
01:19:01,213 --> 01:19:02,441
What are you doing?

698
01:19:04,016 --> 01:19:05,005
l am sorry...

699
01:19:07,953 --> 01:19:10,444
But... you are my husband!

700
01:19:28,140 --> 01:19:34,773
My incomplete story,
my incomplete saga.

701
01:19:35,047 --> 01:19:38,574
My dreams have been shattered.

702
01:19:38,684 --> 01:19:41,812
My hopes have been broken.

703
01:19:42,087 --> 01:19:48,959
On the unknown path,
amidst the strange season.

704
01:19:49,061 --> 01:19:54,499
ls my lonely,
lonely, lonely heart.

705
01:19:54,733 --> 01:20:00,968
ls my lonely,
lonely, lonely heart.

706
01:20:01,941 --> 01:20:08,813
Just the shadows of memories.

707
01:20:12,551 --> 01:20:20,048
And drowning in the
joys and in the sorrows.

708
01:20:20,459 --> 01:20:25,487
ls my lonely,
lonely, lonely heart.

709
01:20:26,031 --> 01:20:32,664
ls my lonely,
lonely, lonely heart.

710
01:20:58,764 --> 01:21:01,733
There is sadness everywhere.

711
01:21:02,234 --> 01:21:05,465
Every eye asks a question.

712
01:21:05,704 --> 01:21:09,140
There is sadness everywhere.

713
01:21:09,375 --> 01:21:12,503
Every eye asks a question.

714
01:21:12,711 --> 01:21:19,412
Every single moment
is void of happiness.

715
01:21:19,518 --> 01:21:26,287
l have come a far from my
destination, all l am left with is.

716
01:21:26,625 --> 01:21:31,824
ls my lonely,
lonely, lonely heart.

717
01:21:32,231 --> 01:21:38,966
ls my lonely,
lonely, lonely heart.

718
01:22:01,260 --> 01:22:04,889
l agree it is the
ambience of night.

719
01:22:04,963 --> 01:22:08,296
There is darkness everywhere.

720
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:11,563
l agree it is the
ambience of night.

721
01:22:11,670 --> 01:22:15,231
There is darkness everywhere.

722
01:22:15,340 --> 01:22:21,973
There is the dawn just ahead.

723
01:22:22,081 --> 01:22:29,112
Thinking that, is feeling happy.

724
01:22:29,221 --> 01:22:34,818
ls my lonely,
lonely, lonely heart.

725
01:22:34,893 --> 01:22:41,662
ls my lonely,
lonely, lonely heart.

726
01:22:42,201 --> 01:22:49,369
Just the shadows of memories.

727
01:22:52,611 --> 01:23:00,484
And drowning in the
joys and in the sorrows.

728
01:23:00,719 --> 01:23:05,656
ls my lonely,
lonely, lonely heart.

729
01:23:06,158 --> 01:23:12,188
ls my lonely,
lonely, lonely heart.

730
01:23:15,234 --> 01:23:16,462
Tea.

731
01:23:22,441 --> 01:23:23,237
Father.

732
01:23:25,778 --> 01:23:27,245
The accounts.

733
01:23:30,582 --> 01:23:33,380
Guess everything is fine now.

734
01:23:35,387 --> 01:23:38,948
l was thinking of going
to Darjeeling for 10 days.

735
01:23:40,626 --> 01:23:42,423
Not now.
- Okay.

736
01:24:06,718 --> 01:24:07,616
Look...

737
01:24:10,455 --> 01:24:11,945
it has been so many days.

738
01:24:13,091 --> 01:24:18,461
l was thinking, let us call
son-in-law home for dinner.

739
01:24:21,066 --> 01:24:22,328
Will he come?

740
01:24:23,669 --> 01:24:25,102
There is no harm in asking him.

741
01:24:26,371 --> 01:24:27,668
We'll tell Janki to ask him.

742
01:24:35,113 --> 01:24:40,915
l like this place very much.
Whenever l get bored, l come here.

743
01:24:42,087 --> 01:24:43,247
lt's a nice place, isn't it?

744
01:24:50,462 --> 01:24:54,398
Will you come home to
have dinner tonight.

745
01:24:54,666 --> 01:24:55,758
...with everyone?

746
01:24:59,204 --> 01:25:03,903
Mother wishes so, and me too.

747
01:25:08,380 --> 01:25:09,677
Okay.

748
01:25:14,453 --> 01:25:17,081
lf you don't mind,
please wear these clothes.

749
01:25:18,156 --> 01:25:19,316
Okay.

750
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:24,554
You get ready, l'll
be back in 5 minutes.

751
01:25:48,387 --> 01:25:49,820
Daughter-in-law.
- Yes.

752
01:25:50,622 --> 01:25:53,523
l am feeling very nervous.
- Why?

753
01:25:54,693 --> 01:25:56,991
We have been waiting
for this day for so long.

754
01:25:57,596 --> 01:25:58,961
Why are you nervous now?

755
01:26:00,465 --> 01:26:03,025
Who knows what
son-in-law will like to eat?

756
01:26:03,368 --> 01:26:05,734
Mother, we have
prepared so many things...

757
01:26:06,138 --> 01:26:07,628
...he will surely like something.

758
01:26:11,610 --> 01:26:14,238
You go and change, l
will get all done here.

759
01:26:15,380 --> 01:26:16,574
Okay.

760
01:27:16,975 --> 01:27:19,409
You fool! He ran away!

761
01:27:29,821 --> 01:27:30,753
Who is it?

762
01:27:41,166 --> 01:27:44,533
Mr. Mahender, so late in the night?

763
01:27:46,071 --> 01:27:49,234
Son-in-law ran away.
- How?

764
01:27:49,508 --> 01:27:52,272
Think of something and catch him...

765
01:27:52,677 --> 01:27:56,306
...if not, then file a case
against him, but bring him back!

766
01:27:57,249 --> 01:28:00,707
Mr. Mahender, it is not so
easy as you think it is...

767
01:28:01,286 --> 01:28:04,221
...his father knows
the police general.

768
01:28:05,490 --> 01:28:07,822
So you can't do anything.

769
01:28:08,794 --> 01:28:11,456
Look l have always supported you...

770
01:28:11,563 --> 01:28:13,053
...l supported you in this also.

771
01:28:13,632 --> 01:28:17,398
But Mr. Mahender,
don't feel offensive but...

772
01:28:17,702 --> 01:28:19,431
lt has been so many days...

773
01:28:19,905 --> 01:28:22,499
...your daughter
should have done something.

774
01:28:23,775 --> 01:28:26,403
Look, l will try.

775
01:28:26,845 --> 01:28:29,871
Who knows how far he
must have gone in the night.

776
01:28:30,715 --> 01:28:33,445
Ramlakhan, take the jeep out.

777
01:28:39,958 --> 01:28:42,722
And you actually expect me to
believe this bizarre story of yours.

778
01:28:44,696 --> 01:28:46,163
Sia, you still doubt me!

779
01:28:47,766 --> 01:28:49,597
You can't imagine... - Can you
imagine what has happened...

780
01:28:49,701 --> 01:28:51,396
...with me here?

781
01:28:52,404 --> 01:28:54,372
Mom is a heart patient, you know!

782
01:28:56,608 --> 01:28:58,439
Anyways, what
difference does it make to you!

783
01:28:58,877 --> 01:29:00,401
You are already married

784
01:29:04,916 --> 01:29:06,281
And l am about to get married.

785
01:29:10,622 --> 01:29:12,385
Why are you looking at me like that?

786
01:29:14,192 --> 01:29:15,887
Why are you doing this to me Sia?

787
01:29:16,228 --> 01:29:19,197
Rags please, please
don't say anything more.

788
01:29:19,297 --> 01:29:21,356
my parents have gone through hell...

789
01:29:21,466 --> 01:29:23,559
...l don't think l will be able to
forgive myself for doing this to them.

790
01:29:24,102 --> 01:29:29,938
But the least l can do is...
not hurt them anymore.

791
01:29:33,145 --> 01:29:37,673
And l don't think my dad
will be happy to see you here.

792
01:30:09,714 --> 01:30:13,673
Tell me one thing, has the
marriage been consummated?

793
01:30:18,523 --> 01:30:20,582
Then there is no problem.

794
01:30:21,459 --> 01:30:25,828
We have already lodged a case
of 498A and dowry prohibition.

795
01:30:26,665 --> 01:30:30,123
Now we will file a case for
restitution of conjugal rights.

796
01:30:30,535 --> 01:30:32,799
Then we will see how
your son-in-law escapes.

797
01:30:36,107 --> 01:30:37,506
Greetings Mr. Mahender.

798
01:30:49,554 --> 01:30:51,488
l heard that your
son-in-law ran away.

799
01:30:52,457 --> 01:30:54,152
lt was very sad to hear that.

800
01:30:55,160 --> 01:30:57,492
And what were those bouncers doing?

801
01:31:00,465 --> 01:31:03,559
What will you do now, have
you thought of anything?

802
01:31:05,270 --> 01:31:07,033
lf you need my help...

803
01:31:13,044 --> 01:31:14,534
Just get these two
medicines that's all.

804
01:31:20,652 --> 01:31:22,313
Greetings Mr. Mahender.

805
01:31:22,420 --> 01:31:26,857
Congratulations! You are going to be
a grandfather. Distribute sweets now.

806
01:31:31,129 --> 01:31:32,926
Okay, l will leave.
- Fine.

807
01:32:01,593 --> 01:32:03,288
There is so much
tension in this house...

808
01:32:03,395 --> 01:32:04,828
...and you are drinking.

809
01:32:08,099 --> 01:32:10,294
There is no tension.

810
01:32:16,908 --> 01:32:19,069
l have thought of everything.

811
01:32:19,844 --> 01:32:23,644
Janki will go to her
in-law's house tomorrow.

812
01:32:25,350 --> 01:32:27,250
Do you know what you
are talking about?

813
01:32:27,519 --> 01:32:29,612
Speak softly.

814
01:32:36,161 --> 01:32:39,426
Look, you know that...

815
01:32:40,198 --> 01:32:43,565
The doctor has said, Janki
needs at least 3 months...

816
01:32:43,668 --> 01:32:46,728
Just do what l tell you to do...

817
01:32:47,205 --> 01:32:49,264
Go, and send Janki here.

818
01:32:49,874 --> 01:32:51,307
Go!

819
01:33:06,691 --> 01:33:08,215
Where are all of them?

820
01:33:11,629 --> 01:33:14,097
Where are my specs... Bechen?

821
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:17,168
Who knows where he kept it?

822
01:33:17,969 --> 01:33:19,231
Hello...

823
01:33:21,573 --> 01:33:24,838
Hello...
- Hello.

824
01:33:26,611 --> 01:33:28,579
Hello...
- Hello

825
01:33:29,814 --> 01:33:32,282
Who is it, Veer!

826
01:33:33,752 --> 01:33:34,946
Where are you son?

827
01:33:36,855 --> 01:33:38,083
How are you?

828
01:33:38,923 --> 01:33:41,357
We were searching for you...

829
01:33:58,576 --> 01:34:01,602
l had a feeling it will be
that scoundrel's work only.

830
01:34:03,348 --> 01:34:04,610
Where is mother?

831
01:34:04,883 --> 01:34:07,818
She has gone to Deoghar
yesterday to pray for you...

832
01:34:07,919 --> 01:34:09,580
...and look, you called today.

833
01:34:11,022 --> 01:34:12,683
Veer listen to me carefully son.

834
01:34:13,024 --> 01:34:17,620
Leave the hostel today,
and shift with Sandeep.

835
01:34:18,596 --> 01:34:21,394
You had been selected in
the mains, do you know.

836
01:34:25,069 --> 01:34:29,631
That's it, stay with
Sandeep and prepare harder...

837
01:34:30,308 --> 01:34:32,503
...next year you
have to become an l.A.S!

838
01:34:34,946 --> 01:34:37,278
And tomorrow when
your mother comes...

839
01:34:37,649 --> 01:34:39,480
l'll call you up.

840
01:34:40,518 --> 01:34:43,043
Take care, bless you.

841
01:35:10,081 --> 01:35:12,049
Are you feeling okay?

842
01:35:20,325 --> 01:35:24,125
What do you think, all
this happening is fine?

843
01:35:26,030 --> 01:35:30,296
What difference will it make
if Janki goes after a few days?

844
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:40,368
ln this condition? who knows
what kind of people they are...

845
01:35:41,446 --> 01:35:43,277
...how the place will be.

846
01:35:44,983 --> 01:35:47,144
Why don't you say something?

847
01:36:45,910 --> 01:36:49,744
What's up? What's taking so long?

848
01:36:50,315 --> 01:36:52,977
Mr. Jagdish is in a hurry,
quickly send the tea.

849
01:36:53,318 --> 01:36:55,149
Let it be, Mr. Sahi, l have
to go to the cold storage...

850
01:36:55,253 --> 01:36:55,947
...some other time.

851
01:36:56,154 --> 01:36:57,587
No, no, no sir sit, it
will come right now.

852
01:36:57,689 --> 01:36:59,088
Send some tea.

853
01:36:59,290 --> 01:37:03,556
Did you find out anything?
- No. - Don't worry.

854
01:37:17,976 --> 01:37:19,910
One minute! One minute!

855
01:37:20,144 --> 01:37:23,170
Congratulations Mr.
Sahi, sweeten your mouth.

856
01:37:23,281 --> 01:37:23,975
What's the occasion?

857
01:37:24,082 --> 01:37:26,949
You are about to become a
grandfather, and me too.

858
01:37:28,586 --> 01:37:29,951
Did you hear Mr. Jagdish?

859
01:37:30,221 --> 01:37:32,382
Have you all come here drunk?

860
01:37:32,824 --> 01:37:36,726
My son is not even married,
then how can l become a grandpa?

861
01:37:36,961 --> 01:37:39,555
Ram, Ram, Ram, such
inauspicious words.

862
01:37:40,031 --> 01:37:41,965
The entire village knows...

863
01:37:42,300 --> 01:37:44,359
...that my daughter is
married to your son.

864
01:37:44,869 --> 01:37:46,234
Dear, touch his feet.

865
01:37:46,471 --> 01:37:48,837
Hey, stop it, stop it! There's no
need for this drama. l don't know her.

866
01:37:49,173 --> 01:37:52,267
l have not opened a
charity-home for you.

867
01:37:52,377 --> 01:37:53,173
Move on, move on.

868
01:37:53,277 --> 01:37:54,301
What you are doing is wrong,
brother-in-law.

869
01:37:54,379 --> 01:37:55,539
l am doing the wrong thing?

870
01:37:55,747 --> 01:37:58,511
...and what you have done
being the uncle... was right?

871
01:37:58,583 --> 01:38:00,551
Don't push me brother-in-law,
what had to happen...

872
01:38:00,652 --> 01:38:02,779
...has happened. Take a
look at the wedding photo.

873
01:38:02,887 --> 01:38:05,014
l have seen many such fake photos.

874
01:38:05,123 --> 01:38:09,253
Look Mr. Sahi, l have been
talking to you with respect...

875
01:38:09,460 --> 01:38:13,089
And you are?
- l am crossing the limit? Eh?

876
01:38:13,498 --> 01:38:15,523
My son has been kidnapped.

877
01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:18,168
l have lodged an FlR with the police.

878
01:38:18,503 --> 01:38:19,868
Mr. Jagdish is the witness.

879
01:38:20,238 --> 01:38:21,705
The police are on their way.

880
01:38:22,040 --> 01:38:25,407
All of you get out of here, or
else you will be behind bars!

881
01:38:25,510 --> 01:38:28,172
Mr. Sahi, it is against
the pride of our village!

882
01:38:28,279 --> 01:38:30,713
l don't do such buffoonery like you.

883
01:38:30,815 --> 01:38:31,941
You people are into this racket.

884
01:38:32,050 --> 01:38:33,244
Hey shut your mouth! Shut up!

885
01:38:33,317 --> 01:38:35,376
Brother-in-law, what had
to happen has happened.

886
01:38:35,620 --> 01:38:36,882
This is your blood.

887
01:38:36,988 --> 01:38:38,717
How would l know whose blood it is?

888
01:38:38,923 --> 01:38:40,515
How would l know where
all she has been to?

889
01:38:40,625 --> 01:38:41,455
Who all she has slept with?

890
01:38:41,559 --> 01:38:42,992
Mr. Sahi!!

891
01:38:45,730 --> 01:38:46,958
Don't shout!

892
01:38:47,065 --> 01:38:49,158
l will file a case against you.
- Go and file it!

893
01:38:49,567 --> 01:38:51,933
l will not let the
judgement pass. ls this a joke!

894
01:38:52,036 --> 01:38:53,367
Don't brag about yourself.

895
01:38:53,471 --> 01:38:55,996
l will brag about myself.

896
01:38:56,107 --> 01:38:58,541
You know the entire
village is the witness.

897
01:38:58,643 --> 01:39:00,838
l will see you! Bloody uncouth,
barbarian, rascal!

898
01:39:43,955 --> 01:39:46,355
Now...

899
01:39:47,558 --> 01:39:51,892
Seems like, maybe l
made some mistake.

900
01:39:52,463 --> 01:39:53,953
Maybe?

901
01:39:55,032 --> 01:39:56,021
l was telling you
from the beginning...

902
01:39:56,134 --> 01:39:57,123
...that all this is wrong.

903
01:39:57,235 --> 01:40:00,227
Quiet! just be quiet!

904
01:40:08,446 --> 01:40:11,074
l will get Janki married again,
with someone else.

905
01:40:12,483 --> 01:40:15,975
Far away.

906
01:40:17,221 --> 01:40:18,688
Have you gone mad?

907
01:40:19,157 --> 01:40:21,022
She is pregnant.

908
01:40:21,793 --> 01:40:24,887
How long does it
take to abort the child?

909
01:40:25,396 --> 01:40:30,163
Great, you have said a
very wonderful thing today.

910
01:40:32,236 --> 01:40:35,728
lf you have the courage, go
and tell your daughter too.

911
01:40:37,775 --> 01:40:42,678
Because l can't even think
of such a disgusting thing.

912
01:40:53,724 --> 01:40:55,021
Dear, dear.

913
01:40:59,263 --> 01:41:00,730
Sit, sit.

914
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:32,020
Sometimes a man
thinks of something...

915
01:41:32,630 --> 01:41:34,325
...and something else happens.

916
01:41:35,499 --> 01:41:40,527
No one can go against
the will of the Lord.

917
01:41:46,811 --> 01:41:48,438
We will go to Patna in a day or two.

918
01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:51,105
We will meet a good doctor.

919
01:41:52,750 --> 01:41:54,513
Everything will be fine.

920
01:41:59,257 --> 01:42:01,384
This boy was not right.

921
01:42:03,327 --> 01:42:04,885
doesn't matter.

922
01:42:06,197 --> 01:42:09,633
l will look for another boy.

923
01:42:11,369 --> 01:42:13,564
This time nothing will go wrong.

924
01:42:25,216 --> 01:42:28,617
Come, we will have
breakfast together. Come on.

925
01:43:55,539 --> 01:43:57,700
Janki. Janki!

926
01:44:04,382 --> 01:44:05,849
Where are you going?

927
01:44:06,484 --> 01:44:09,749
l don't know, l have
not thought about it.

928
01:44:10,421 --> 01:44:14,084
What is the problem here?
- YOU!

929
01:44:16,127 --> 01:44:17,424
What are you doing?

930
01:44:18,662 --> 01:44:23,497
Quiet! Tell her
that she has gone mad!

931
01:44:24,168 --> 01:44:25,294
What are you doing?

932
01:44:25,369 --> 01:44:27,803
You keep quiet! Tell her!

933
01:44:27,872 --> 01:44:29,806
Whatever l am doing,
it is for her good...

934
01:44:29,907 --> 01:44:31,238
...she doesn't understand!

935
01:44:40,718 --> 01:44:45,553
l know father, you have always
done everything for my good!

936
01:44:47,558 --> 01:44:49,253
But you have done enough
good for me!

937
01:44:49,860 --> 01:44:52,590
Now no more.
- Janki, you...

938
01:44:52,963 --> 01:44:55,090
The life that's budding in me...

939
01:44:55,466 --> 01:44:59,163
...l will not tolerate
anyone who thinks ill of him!

940
01:45:02,940 --> 01:45:09,140
Dear, you... in this condition...
alone.

941
01:45:09,246 --> 01:45:10,907
Nothing will happen to me mother.

942
01:45:12,249 --> 01:45:16,276
You won't go anywhere?
- l will go father.

943
01:45:16,353 --> 01:45:20,016
Without my permission, you
cannot step out of this house!

944
01:45:21,225 --> 01:45:23,659
but l can kill myself can't l?
- Janki!

945
01:45:32,203 --> 01:45:36,299
Till now l have been living my
life according to your wishes...

946
01:45:37,441 --> 01:45:39,136
...but not anymore.

947
01:45:39,677 --> 01:45:42,771
Now l will live my
life the way l want to...

948
01:45:44,081 --> 01:45:46,641
...and don't even dare to stop me.
