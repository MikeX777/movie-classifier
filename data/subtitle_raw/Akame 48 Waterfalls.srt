Proposal:
Akame Works

00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:39,170
<b>AKAME 48 WATERFALLS</b>

00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,160
<i>"Through me the way into the
suffering city..." - Dante Alghieri</i>

4
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:54,750
<i>I heard that the people there</i>

5
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:58,170
<i>have a unique attachment to
this town, Amagasaki,</i>

6
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,700
<i>and call it Ama.</i>

7
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,550
<i>"Through me the way into
the suffering city."</i>

8
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,300
<i>I, as a vagabond,</i>

9
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:11,180
<i>as one of the many who eke out a living,</i>

10
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:15,170
<i>came from Kamagasaki to this place.</i>

11
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:21,320
Do you have a light?

12
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:37,190
My apologies, man.

13
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:45,220
Take this and buy some cigarettes.

14
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,230
Is anyone here?

15
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,650
My name is Ikushima.

16
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,720
I heard about you in
Kamagasaki and came here.

17
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,260
Oh, it's you.

18
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:58,950
I heard in Kamagasaki that you
have a college degree.

19
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:04,670
It seems like you have
a good education.

20
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,290
Were you expelled?

21
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,300
I dropped out.

22
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,310
Dropped out?

23
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:19,300
Forget it.

24
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,570
There are lowlife losers like pigs.

25
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,310
I heard you want to be hired no
matter how much I pay you.

26
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,310
I don't know how much is enough
for someone exceptional like you.

27
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,720
How much do you want?

28
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:46,550
5 yen per skewer of tripe.

29
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:50,120
Chopping them up and skewering
them finally pays only 5 yen,

30
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,970
so you have to work hard and make
1.000 skewers a day to make ends meet.

31
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,600
How much do you want?

32
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:03,600
The more I get, the better,
of course.

33
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:10,350
It would be good if you could
put your heart into the work.

34
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:15,600
And your name?

35
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,550
What is it again?

36
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,620
Yoichi Ikushima.

37
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:26,650
How dare you come to a place like this,
even though you have parents who named you?

38
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:33,670
I'll do as you say, sister Seiko.

39
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,300
All right, then.

40
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:04,400
Thanks for looking after us.

41
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,460
Thanks for looking after us.
How are you doing?

42
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,450
Not bad, I guess.

43
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,170
Remember what happened
seven years ago?

44
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:06,120
Gods and foreigners alike are
vulnerable to earthquakes, it seems.

45
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,650
Anyway, this is a Jizo statue for
dropouts, so it fits right in here.

46
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:21,450
Don't bother with her nonsense.

47
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:57,700
The window's broken.

48
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:00,820
And the light...

49
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:03,170
Oh, still good.

50
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:08,220
The faucet is working.

51
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:12,200
The quilts are in the cabinet.

52
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,530
Worry not.

53
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:22,700
Everything you need daily
should all be here now.

54
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,950
As for your personal belongings,

55
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:33,270
you cannot be too careful with them.

56
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:36,540
Those things will go into the
mouths of my customers, right?

57
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,560
I will not pay for a poorly made
skewer. Understand?

58
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:46,570
- Are you listening?
- Yes.

59
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:49,720
You're a cute boy.

60
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:55,850
I should tell you that.

61
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,580
You're still very young.

62
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,620
<i>As a living human being,</i>

63
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:43,300
<i>I do not fit in this society.</i>

64
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:47,620
<i>I may think, but I do not act.</i>

65
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:53,000
<i>Mr. Shinkai, do I have
what it takes?</i>

66
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:56,640
<i>I don't even have a family now.</i>

67
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:00,550
<i>This dictionary's been with me
for more than 10 years.</i>

68
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,640
<i>I named it Mr. Shinkai.</i>

69
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:09,660
<i>At this moment,</i>

70
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:13,650
<i>only I speak with Mr. Shinkai.</i>

71
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,710
This is the tendon.

72
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,710
Just like this.

73
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,720
Cut it this way.

74
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,730
- Got it?
- Yes.

75
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:20,770
We want the food to look nice.

76
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:24,800
So, be sure to be careful
when flipping it over.

77
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,620
It won't sell if it's stained.

78
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,370
Watch over it.

79
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,770
Stick right into the center.

80
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,720
And don't stop making
another piece.

81
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,370
Good.

82
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,740
Got it?

83
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,200
You'll get used to it.

84
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:53,250
Take your time.

85
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:54,760
I see.

86
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:58,750
The guy who just came in delivers the
meat every morning at ten o'clock,

87
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:02,170
and picks up the finished skewers
at five o'clock in the evening.

88
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,760
It's always the same,
so don't get nervous.

89
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,780
Want some coffee?

90
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,780
No, I don't drink coffee.

91
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:13,570
It's a rhetorical question.

92
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,050
No answer needed.

93
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,150
Granny!

94
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,370
Thank you for your help last time.

95
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:27,220
I heard you made it in time.

96
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:29,620
You really helped me a lot.

97
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:31,000
Thank you so much!

98
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,500
I'm just glad to have you.

99
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,770
I'm sure he would be
happy to see you.

100
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:39,070
But my brother is so cold to me.

101
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,370
He's hateful.

102
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,370
He's just shy, you know.

103
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,870
He's getting out of prison
soon, apparently.

104
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:48,900
Really?
Do you have more details?

105
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:52,420
He wants to come back to Ama.

106
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:55,820
But, your brother...

107
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,270
He came a long way.
Why not let him stay for a while?

108
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:03,250
As long as he's over there,
there's nothing to worry about.

109
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,840
That's just the way he is.
It can't be helped.

110
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,470
That's what master told me.

111
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:13,220
I shouldn't be talking about it.

112
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,420
Anyway, I don't wanna be involved.

113
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:19,250
Not much I can do, I'm leaving now!
Granny, see you next time.

114
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:21,250
Come pay me a visit!

115
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,840
Thanks.

116
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,770
You.

117
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:57,250
How old were you when the
Expo was held in Osaka?

118
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:03,470
I was born in July of 1970.

119
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,200
I see.

120
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:06,890
Wasn't that a good time?

121
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,870
So, you're two generations
younger than me?

122
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I think so.

123
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,300
I was in my hometown, Iga,
until then,

124
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,270
and left for Osaka when
the Expo was held,

125
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,200
and became a whore there.

126
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,920
For five years,

127
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:38,270
I sold my youth for money.

128
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,250
I, then, went back to see my dad,

129
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:44,930
wearing red high-heels.

130
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:51,120
I didn't like those shoes,
you know,

131
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:54,750
but I bought them anyway.

132
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,870
You know what my dad said?

133
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:06,070
"Nice shoes".
That's all he said.

134
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,950
Yesterday, when I met you
on your way to the shop,

135
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:16,960
I was hoping you'd say that,
as well.

136
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,970
- I wanted you to say it.
- What?

137
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:22,970
You are very well-educated.

138
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,970
You went to a very good college,
right?

139
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,970
- But, now, you fell to such a place...
- No...

140
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,250
Also,

141
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:41,990
I never told anyone that I
was a prostitute.

142
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,980
Kept it as a secret.

143
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:50,000
Although I never told anyone,
people seem to know more or less.

144
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:52,000
But,

145
00:17:52,950 --> 00:18:00,900
I wanted to tell someone this
before I die.

146
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:10,200
It's painful to hide certain things
from others.

147
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,400
I got it.

148
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:21,770
Isn't Aya beautiful,
the girl you just met?

149
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,100
Don't give me that face.

150
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:28,850
Let me tell you something.

151
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:31,520
That girl's Korean.

152
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:46,320
Through the center...

153
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,250
Don't make a sound...

154
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:50,290
Master, thank you very much.

155
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:16,310
Do not step on it!

156
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:41,720
Hey, you!

157
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:45,020
Wanna come to my place?

158
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,350
What do ya want?

159
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:26,420
Gotanda, Meguro, Ebisu...

160
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:34,070
Shibuya, Harajuku, Yoyogi...

161
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,820
Shinjuku, Shin-Okubo...

162
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:47,770
Takadanobaba, Mejiro, Ikebukuro...

163
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:55,800
Otsuka, Sugamo, Komagome...

164
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:00,470
Tabata, Nippori...

165
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:04,200
Uguisudani...

166
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:10,550
Ueno, Okachimachi...

167
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:21,050
Akihabara, Kanda, Tokyo...

168
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:26,440
Yurakucho, Shimbashi...

169
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:32,570
Hamamatsucho, Tamachi, Shinagawa...

170
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,770
Osaki...

171
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:37,370
The train is arriving at Osaki!

172
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:48,770
{\an8} <i> Ejaculate: to produce semen</i>

173
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:47,800
Why does it happen so quickly?

174
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,370
You feel almost dead
after you drink it.

175
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,530
Must be that kind of alcohol.

176
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:41,700
Why would I drink that?

177
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:46,520
Only this kind of alcohol
makes you happier than death.

178
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:50,200
The edge of death. This time,
give it a try!

179
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:54,200
Are we still going to get
returning customers in the future?

180
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,540
Don't jinx it!

181
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,850
Nobody knows the future.

182
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,550
Worrying about your food is enough.

183
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,350
Just live from day to day!
Day to day!

184
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:24,370
I'm gonna kill you!

185
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:27,720
Who do you think I am?

186
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:30,640
What's that attitude?

187
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:32,650
This job is an opportunity for you.

188
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,520
Go back to Tokyo if you don't like it.

189
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:37,850
If it wasn't for your damn elder
sister, you'd be nothing by now!

190
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,650
Guys like you can be found anywhere.

191
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:45,020
Cut your ears off if you do that again!

192
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:49,650
Keep that in mind!

193
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,350
Ouch.

194
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,740
Thank you so much!

195
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:26,300
Honestly...

196
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,320
- Can you give me a ride to my place?
- Yes.

197
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:49,830
Is anyone here?

198
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:55,100
Is anyone here?

199
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:05,850
I'm Sanada.

200
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,570
Is Aya here?

201
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,860
But I sensed that she was.

202
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:15,860
You, mind out. I'm her brother.

203
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,150
There were five guys who have
been buried or sunk

204
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:23,860
because of the kind of attitude
you're having towards me.

205
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:29,880
Hey, look at me carefully.

206
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,070
How about it?

207
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:33,880
Don't you think I'm cute?

208
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:37,600
I'm just like Aya, aren't I?

209
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:42,350
Forget it.

210
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,920
Today, I'm busy.

211
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:48,900
When she's back, tell her to call me.

212
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:50,890
I will.

213
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,900
What's your name?

214
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,900
Ikushima.

215
00:32:58,050 --> 00:33:01,910
Okay. Then, excuse me
for asking you this favor!

216
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:03,900
Ikushima!

217
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:25,920
What's up?

218
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,300
Mr. Sanada and I met today at noon.

219
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,600
He came here to see Aya.

220
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,950
Who is it? My dad?

221
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:41,600
Shut your trap, Shinpei.

222
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:48,250
Mr. Sanada wants her
to give him a call.

223
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,950
Is that so? Then, excuse me.

224
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:06,120
Thank you for yesterday's help!

225
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,350
That guy's my brother.

226
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:15,370
A cold-hearted guy,
just like me, right?

227
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:17,970
No...

228
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:22,250
He has always been like this.

229
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:25,980
It's kinda embarrassing to say.

230
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,520
Hey, kid.

231
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,920
You should be glad.

232
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:38,110
Men should learn to endure.

233
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,950
Or are you dissatisfied with me?

234
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,350
Ouch!

235
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:46,400
That hurt!
Why did you do that?

236
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:48,250
- Then, let's do it again.
- Ouch, ouch!

237
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:06,220
Takeshi.

238
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:11,320
Whatever happens,
let us gather here.

239
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,970
This time, I'll come for you
soon, so bear with me.

240
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:26,900
Those words have been said
too frequently.

241
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:37,000
We pray for his well-being
later in life.

242
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:38,550
That's right.

243
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:44,800
For this, we put our hands together.

244
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:46,070
No!

245
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:49,200
Our hands together!

246
00:37:58,370 --> 00:38:03,750
This is certainly Horimayu's work.
I've heard so many things about it.

247
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,450
What's with that?

248
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,520
What are you doing?

249
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:29,850
Mr. Horimayu said it was fine.

250
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:34,150
- Nobody told me about that.
- Take this, double pay.

251
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:41,570
I'm begging you.
Your tattoo is very beautiful.

252
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:46,570
Such a treasure must
be recorded now.

253
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:49,970
Beauty goes away so
quickly, you know?

254
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:53,270
What? Say that again.

255
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:55,650
You don't have to raise your voice.

256
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:58,700
Give me the tape.
Give me that immediately!

257
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:01,550
I haven't recorded anything yet,

258
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:04,100
and I haven't paid Mr. Horimayu either.

259
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:05,600
That's not my business.

260
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:09,100
Don't underestimate me as a woman.

261
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,550
I won't lose a fight against you.

262
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:12,800
- Wait.
- Get out.

263
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:16,800
Please bear with me. I'll leave you
the money, so forgive me please.

264
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:18,370
Say that again!

265
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,970
I don't want this kind of creepy
money. Take it back!

266
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,900
Remember this!

267
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:31,370
I have to go on a trip soon.

268
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:41,250
To look at Keman* to match
it to your back.

269
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:41,270
{\an8} <i>*Keman is one of the ornaments of
a Buddhist temple or statue.</i>

270
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:04,170
Oh, no!

271
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:09,000
What's going on?

272
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:16,300
Please come and see immediately.
Someone's bleeding!

273
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,950
That man.

274
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:41,900
Don't stand in my way.

275
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:17,170
So, you wanna blame
me for this, huh?

276
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,270
Where are his pants?

277
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:24,460
Just move on when you get up.

278
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:56,070
Thank you for your assistance.

279
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:18,120
- I heard last night there was a mess.
- Huh?

280
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:23,570
Don't worry.
I'll have a word with them.

281
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:31,750
Today,

282
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:35,970
I need to ask you something.

283
00:43:36,370 --> 00:43:37,470
What?

284
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:43,100
About 10 minutes before 1:00, go to
the pay phone in front of the station.

285
00:43:43,350 --> 00:43:45,870
- Inside, you'll find phone books.
- Yes.

286
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:50,170
There are five 10.000 yen bills tucked
into the phone book at the bottom.

287
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:54,570
I want you to pick them up at exactly
1 PM without being seen.

288
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,450
You said you don't want others to see,
but the police is right in front of...

289
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,050
I know.

290
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:03,250
That's why I'm asking you!

291
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:07,400
Got it.

292
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:16,220
Damn fool, stay here first!
Wait until it's time.

293
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:37,200
Oh, thanks.

294
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:54,820
Weren't you gonna pay me off last month?
What's your excuse this time, you fool?

295
00:44:54,970 --> 00:44:56,820
Hey, hurry up and pay me!

296
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:25,350
Now, we have a problem.

297
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:28,670
Can he really do the job?

298
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:30,700
Poor soul.

299
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,270
I think he can't.

300
00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:38,000
What's your damn problem?

301
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:48,700
It doesn't smell good in here.

302
00:49:17,950 --> 00:49:30,750
<i>Ogin, she's ninety-nine and wants
to marry into the Kumano region</i>

303
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:45,200
<i>She lost her back teeth
before her marriage</i>

304
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:58,700
<i>Her back teeth fell out, but
she still had her front teeth</i>

305
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:12,770
<i>She blackened her two front teeth</i>

306
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:30,450
<i>And put a hairpin in her
thinning gray hair</i>

307
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:46,350
<i>Wearing a red kimono,
gen-kora gen-kora</i>

308
00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:55,680
- Sorry for doing that to you last time.
- No problem.

309
00:50:57,070 --> 00:51:00,170
It's not easy to deal with that guy.

310
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:04,920
If I left him alone, I would
have to take responsibility.

311
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:07,400
It's very tough.

312
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:12,450
Thank you for helping me.

313
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:16,620
As a timid person,
I do things carefully.

314
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:20,370
Everyone's the same.

315
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:24,570
I rely on you because you do, too.

316
00:51:25,370 --> 00:51:26,620
Thanks.

317
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:29,050
No, it's...

318
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:32,820
A moment ago,

319
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:35,550
you've heard a song I know
since I was born.

320
00:51:36,550 --> 00:51:39,200
It's a very pleasant song, isn't it?

321
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:42,150
You think so?

322
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:48,150
I may get married at 59 just like
the woman in the song, Ogin.

323
00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:20,300
What are you looking at?

324
00:52:20,450 --> 00:52:22,120
You can't look at it!

325
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:41,200
Uncle, you saw it.

326
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:43,670
- What is it?
- A frog.

327
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:46,700
I wasn't expecting to see
a frog inside.

328
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,250
Ah, I was careless.

329
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,320
Let me have a look as well.

330
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,750
It will die, if uncle you look at it!

331
00:52:54,850 --> 00:52:57,370
- Huh?
- You can't look!

332
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:16,620
Do you want to eat this?

333
00:53:17,850 --> 00:53:19,570
Thank you very much.

334
00:53:24,270 --> 00:53:25,850
It's nice, isn't it?

335
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:29,400
Working in a place like
this every day.

336
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:35,420
It's fine here.

337
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:39,370
Why don't you pick them up?

338
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:41,630
Oh, thank you very much.

339
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:47,650
Granny has said lots of funny things.

340
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:50,870
Funny things? Like what?

341
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:54,320
She said you're just like the
mummy of an ancient boy

342
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:57,660
who was brought back
to life in this world.

343
00:53:58,270 --> 00:54:01,650
So, it’s hard for you to live in Ama.

344
00:54:03,970 --> 00:54:08,150
That's right! Previously, you were
sent to steal something.

345
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:10,670
Did you know about that?

346
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,150
I was watching.

347
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:20,120
But you saved Granny.
Risking your own life.

348
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:24,690
But, not long ago,

349
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:27,700
you seemed to be following me, right?

350
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:38,670
Better not do that again,

351
00:54:39,650 --> 00:54:43,150
knowing that everyone's
watching you.

352
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:10,350
Would you like to eat anything?

353
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:15,450
Grilled mackerel or fried tofu?

354
00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:19,790
You don't seem to have an appetite,
so fried tofu it is.

355
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:24,250
Uncle, you saw my frog, right?

356
00:56:24,810 --> 00:56:25,750
I did.

357
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:28,800
The frog's dead.
All because you've seen it.

358
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:31,070
Screw you!

359
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:56,840
What happened to your face?

360
00:56:56,950 --> 00:56:59,020
I fell off the stairs.

361
00:56:59,350 --> 00:57:00,270
Liar!

362
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:18,670
Hey, did you really stumble?

363
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:21,550
- Yeah...
- Were you hit by someone?

364
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:24,120
I have to go now.

365
00:57:26,870 --> 00:57:28,860
What's going on with you?

366
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:00,100
<i>Since I lack necessary documents,</i>

367
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:02,620
<i>I don't have health insurance,</i>

368
00:58:02,910 --> 00:58:06,000
<i>which means I can't get sick.</i>

369
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:10,470
<i>Running out of road,
I can only go to Kyoto.</i>

370
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:15,520
<i>"Let Mr. Okamoto have a look
at my wounds."</i>

371
00:58:16,070 --> 00:58:17,520
<i>That's what I thought.</i>

372
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:33,170
<i>I have been here in Amagasaki,</i>

373
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:36,000
<i>for more than 4 months now.</i>

374
00:58:37,350 --> 00:58:39,870
<i>It's obvious that
I don't belong here.</i>

375
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:42,270
<i>Sooner or later,</i>

376
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,650
<i>I have to leave this place.</i>

377
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:50,450
<i>I have a premonition of that.</i>

378
00:59:24,170 --> 00:59:26,600
<i>This scented bag,</i>

379
00:59:26,850 --> 00:59:29,620
<i>when the moment of farewell
is certain,</i>

380
00:59:29,850 --> 00:59:32,150
<i>I want to give it to
sister Seiko as a gift.</i>

381
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:34,350
<i>I'm buying it in preparation for that.</i>

382
00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:03,770
Send this to sister Seiko
before 12:00 pm today.

383
01:00:05,030 --> 01:00:06,550
Understood?

384
01:00:07,030 --> 01:00:08,570
Today at noon.

385
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:17,030
See ya.

386
01:00:30,550 --> 01:00:36,620
I'm always having nightmares.

387
01:00:48,070 --> 01:00:51,020
This is a tuberose.

388
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:56,070
Blossomed secretly in the dark.

389
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:01,970
I've only seen its blooming once.
Just like this.

390
01:01:02,250 --> 01:01:07,000
Well, Sai asked me to give you this.

391
01:01:23,110 --> 01:01:25,270
- It's so annoying.
- Huh?

392
01:01:30,750 --> 01:01:33,110
This has nothing to do with you.

393
01:01:40,150 --> 01:01:43,130
- You went to see a doctor, right?
- Yes.

394
01:01:43,270 --> 01:01:45,130
Sorry for making you worry.

395
01:01:45,450 --> 01:01:48,130
There are a lot of naughty
ones around here.

396
01:01:48,370 --> 01:01:51,250
But, for some,
they still need to be careful.

397
01:01:56,140 --> 01:01:57,870
Thank you for your visit.

398
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:03,150
A beautiful lady?

399
01:02:03,250 --> 01:02:05,150
Did you find her in a hot spring?

400
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:07,370
-  A woman from the hostess bar.
- Hostess bar?

401
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:09,470
The elders will be back soon.

402
01:02:13,370 --> 01:02:14,270
Hurry.

403
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:15,770
Hey, give that to me.

404
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:17,620
I'll greet them honestly.

405
01:02:18,970 --> 01:02:19,950
You not giving it?

406
01:02:21,950 --> 01:02:24,950
Wanna do that again?
Once would be enough!

407
01:02:25,150 --> 01:02:29,550
Just stop this already.
Give him a break, okay?

408
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:34,170
Divine Punishment!
Divine Punishment!

409
01:02:36,970 --> 01:02:40,700
Divine Punishment!
Divine Punishment!

410
01:02:42,950 --> 01:02:45,670
Divine Punishment!
Divine Punishment!

411
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:53,700
The expression "Divine Punishment"
is quite popular at school now.

412
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:55,820
Divine Punishment!
Divine Punishment!

413
01:02:55,900 --> 01:03:01,900
If you remember this expression
for 4 years, you will die.

414
01:03:01,970 --> 01:03:02,600
What?

415
01:03:02,970 --> 01:03:06,450
Running around and calling out
the phrase "Divine Punishment".

416
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:11,200
Divine Punishment!
Divine Punishment!

417
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:14,620
Divine Punishment!
Divine Punishment!

418
01:03:15,220 --> 01:03:17,210
Divine Punishment?

419
01:03:33,150 --> 01:03:38,350
<i>Divine Punishment:
punishing others for God.</i>

420
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:40,230
Divine Punishment...

421
01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:43,750
Divine Punishment!

422
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:48,900
Divine Punishment!

423
01:03:55,020 --> 01:03:57,750
Mr. Ikushima,  can I have a moment?

424
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:59,350
Please.

425
01:04:06,620 --> 01:04:11,400
In fact, I need to ask you for a favor.

426
01:04:12,450 --> 01:04:14,280
What's up?

427
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:21,470
Will you keep this for me,
just for two or three days?

428
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:37,290
Should I just keep that in the closet?

429
01:04:38,270 --> 01:04:42,290
Then, it's all good. Thank you.

430
01:05:06,850 --> 01:05:09,000
Something's wrong?

431
01:05:12,650 --> 01:05:16,970
All you do is eyeing women.

432
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:21,120
- You better stop doing that.
- Yes...

433
01:05:22,170 --> 01:05:25,850
It's your only hateful behavior.

434
01:05:26,270 --> 01:05:29,350
I'm glad you understand that.

435
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:34,270
What is it? Don't look at me
with that weird face.

436
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:39,970
Thanks for giving me
cherries last time.

437
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:44,000
How's the food I gave you?
Delicious?

438
01:05:44,150 --> 01:05:45,370
Yes.

439
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:48,320
It'd be good if I could bring
them to you often.

440
01:05:48,370 --> 01:05:49,500
What?

441
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:53,370
- Why are you acting so surprised?
- Well...

442
01:05:55,250 --> 01:05:59,820
Do you think something
is wrong with me?

443
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:02,150
No, I just...

444
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,400
Mr. Ikushima.

445
01:06:15,170 --> 01:06:18,400
This place is not suitable for you.

446
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:21,850
You're different from us.

447
01:06:53,670 --> 01:06:58,950
I also wounded my hand with a knife.

448
01:06:59,100 --> 01:07:00,520
What happened?

449
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:02,430
Nothing serious.

450
01:07:03,450 --> 01:07:06,450
Your face seems to have
recovered fully.

451
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:08,500
Despite the scar.

452
01:07:10,470 --> 01:07:11,670
All right.

453
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:24,460
Would you mind taking good
care of this here?

454
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,900
The room doesn't have enough light.

455
01:07:28,020 --> 01:07:31,250
This plant might be able to bloom here.

456
01:07:34,670 --> 01:07:38,120
Watering a bit every day.
It should be all right.

457
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:41,170
It's fine if it withered.

458
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:43,480
Got it.

459
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:47,020
Just once more.

460
01:07:47,490 --> 01:07:51,120
How good it would be
to watch it bloom at night.

461
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:08,320
<i>I'm always having nightmares.</i>

462
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:12,400
<i>Sister Seiko knows,</i>

463
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:15,200
<i>that story of the tuberose.</i>

464
01:08:35,170 --> 01:08:37,520
<i>That day will be coming soon,</i>

465
01:08:38,540 --> 01:08:41,900
<i>the day when I have to
leave this place.</i>

466
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:57,670
Stand up.

467
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:24,450
<i>I'm prepared, in case of emergency.</i>

468
01:14:25,550 --> 01:14:27,050
<i>But,</i>

469
01:14:27,890 --> 01:14:29,950
<i>I don't want to leave here.</i>

470
01:14:41,750 --> 01:14:44,100
<i>Five days ago, that night,</i>

471
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:48,320
<i>after that heart-pounding start,</i>

472
01:14:48,910 --> 01:14:50,900
<i>with Aya.</i>

473
01:15:34,020 --> 01:15:36,800
<i>I think I might get killed.</i>

474
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:40,900
<i>It's fine if that happens.</i>

475
01:15:50,970 --> 01:15:52,700
<i>Because of that,</i>

476
01:15:53,550 --> 01:15:56,200
<i>I like being here.</i>

477
01:17:12,620 --> 01:17:14,650
What's up?

478
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:18,400
Nothing.

479
01:17:19,550 --> 01:17:23,120
Cheer up! Takeshi.

480
01:17:23,970 --> 01:17:28,060
Greet this unusual brother.

481
01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:36,370
What's up?

482
01:18:36,850 --> 01:18:39,550
The box that you asked me to keep...

483
01:18:40,140 --> 01:18:42,140
Oh, that.

484
01:18:42,250 --> 01:18:44,150
That's a very important one.

485
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:47,150
Yes. Because it's very important...

486
01:18:47,870 --> 01:18:51,850
I have some reasons and would
like you to keep it a little longer.

487
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,820
No, I can't keep that for you anymore.

488
01:18:55,470 --> 01:18:59,750
I believe I deposited 10.000 yen
with you at Amagasaki Station.

489
01:19:00,050 --> 01:19:03,350
Should have given you
10.000 yen as storage fee.

490
01:19:03,620 --> 01:19:07,370
Last time, I gave you too little
at the train station.

491
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:10,550
Mr. Horimayu...

492
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:18,400
Huh? When did you start
calling me that?

493
01:19:19,250 --> 01:19:20,770
I'm sorry.

494
01:19:21,670 --> 01:19:26,770
You know,
that box is as important as my life.

495
01:19:27,450 --> 01:19:33,020
I'm asking you, as a man,
to keep this to yourself.

496
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:36,200
Wouldn't you like to accept it?

497
01:19:36,270 --> 01:19:38,620
No. It's not like that.

498
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:43,750
Should I tell this to sister Seiko...?

499
01:19:44,210 --> 01:19:46,620
No, not that fool.

500
01:19:47,210 --> 01:19:50,210
She's just a greedy bitch.

501
01:19:51,350 --> 01:19:57,120
She messed up and burned something
I care about, you know.

502
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:05,870
It's really a good thing.

503
01:20:07,550 --> 01:20:09,220
What?

504
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:12,700
Mr. Ikushima.

505
01:20:13,820 --> 01:20:16,240
You're a man without self-confidence.

506
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,650
I used to look down on you.

507
01:20:19,820 --> 01:20:22,420
Only a fool would accept a low
salary like that.

508
01:20:22,470 --> 01:20:24,520
Doing that boring work.

509
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:28,200
Burying your head in it every day.

510
01:20:28,870 --> 01:20:31,700
It's no wonder you have no vigor.

511
01:20:31,820 --> 01:20:35,300
No, I'm just useless...

512
01:20:35,420 --> 01:20:39,970
You don't watch TV after work.

513
01:20:40,260 --> 01:20:42,850
And you have no hobbies.

514
01:20:43,270 --> 01:20:46,370
No wonder Aya is worried about you.

515
01:20:47,220 --> 01:20:52,870
She said, “he’s just like the
mummy of an ancient boy.”

516
01:20:54,700 --> 01:20:56,070
How about it?

517
01:20:56,280 --> 01:21:01,820
Why don't you screw Aya once?

518
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:05,800
Her clit is itching.

519
01:21:08,900 --> 01:21:10,900
When I touched it,

520
01:21:10,970 --> 01:21:16,000
it seemed eager for
you to touch it.

521
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:18,170
That's how people say that, right?

522
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:24,170
It makes me impotent
through jealousy.

523
01:21:25,220 --> 01:21:28,700
No, how could I do that?

524
01:21:33,700 --> 01:21:37,150
She has good pussy juice.

525
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:41,450
If you excuse me,

526
01:21:43,670 --> 01:21:46,170
I have to go now.

527
01:21:58,870 --> 01:22:00,330
Come in.

528
01:22:01,340 --> 01:22:03,330
The paper airplanes are ready.

529
01:22:04,820 --> 01:22:07,120
Shinpei, what's going on?

530
01:22:07,350 --> 01:22:08,820
It's Yamane.

531
01:22:08,950 --> 01:22:11,070
Yamane from Tokyo.

532
01:22:11,550 --> 01:22:13,340
- Don't come in.
- Hey!

533
01:22:13,450 --> 01:22:16,670
- You're Ikushima, right?
- Wait, wait a second.

534
01:22:18,370 --> 01:22:19,970
What's wrong?

535
01:22:27,770 --> 01:22:30,550
Sorry for coming here
all of a sudden.

536
01:22:30,950 --> 01:22:33,380
Now, I'm working.

537
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:35,379
I'm sorry.

538
01:22:35,380 --> 01:22:39,380
Can you go and wait for me at the shop
in front of the train station?

539
01:22:40,250 --> 01:22:41,620
That won't do it.

540
01:22:44,650 --> 01:22:47,380
I need to talk to you.

541
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:54,100
I went to where you used to live.

542
01:22:54,150 --> 01:22:56,400
Heard that you came here.

543
01:22:56,600 --> 01:23:00,400
Others told me you weren't there.
My mind went blank.

544
01:23:00,850 --> 01:23:05,770
You disappeared from Kamagasaki.
I even thought you were already dead.

545
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:09,820
I've died to come to this place.

546
01:23:14,970 --> 01:23:17,420
Why did you come to this sort of place?

547
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:19,850
Because it's near Koshien.

548
01:23:20,350 --> 01:23:23,410
There must be some
particular reason.

549
01:23:25,870 --> 01:23:29,050
Can you leave? I'm sorry.

550
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:30,430
Why?

551
01:23:31,050 --> 01:23:35,500
I don't get it.
Why are you doing this?

552
01:23:36,420 --> 01:23:38,700
Are you still writing your draft?

553
01:23:38,820 --> 01:23:40,850
Forget it!

554
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:45,400
I have a job now.

555
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:49,450
I'm earning money for food,
showering, drinking, and sleeping.

556
01:23:49,820 --> 01:23:51,020
That's all there is to it.

557
01:23:51,050 --> 01:23:54,550
I... can finally get my own
project in the editorial office.

558
01:23:54,720 --> 01:23:57,600
If you've finished your writing,
hand it to me.

559
01:23:57,650 --> 01:23:58,700
Forget it.

560
01:23:58,720 --> 01:24:00,870
I'll help you, in any capacity.
Come with me.

561
01:24:00,900 --> 01:24:02,460
- Please, leave.
- Hey...

562
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:04,460
Leave me alone!

563
01:24:06,770 --> 01:24:08,950
What happened to that guy?

564
01:24:09,900 --> 01:24:13,470
He's been working hard.
Always have and always will.

565
01:24:13,770 --> 01:24:16,220
You're doing that again,
that kind of work.

566
01:24:16,270 --> 01:24:19,070
I do as much as I can
to read writings from new writers.

567
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:21,650
- Your writings were...
- Stop it.

568
01:24:23,020 --> 01:24:24,870
The other side is powerful, right?

569
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,250
It's not like that!

570
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:28,970
Don't be so loud!
I don't want people to listen!

571
01:24:30,350 --> 01:24:32,970
What's up with this ruckus?

572
01:24:35,870 --> 01:24:38,470
- Can I come in?
- Please do.

573
01:24:43,300 --> 01:24:46,510
- This place is so hot.
- Thank you.

574
01:24:46,650 --> 01:24:50,270
- How's it going in the shop?
- It's fine, it's fine.

575
01:24:53,970 --> 01:24:56,520
Eat while it's hot.

576
01:24:57,120 --> 01:25:00,870
It looks very delicious.
My pleasure!

577
01:25:02,170 --> 01:25:05,800
Ikushima.
Now, you sit here.

578
01:25:05,950 --> 01:25:08,300
Sorry. I've got other things to do.

579
01:25:08,700 --> 01:25:10,820
It's better if I wasn't here, right?

580
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:14,250
No, that's not it.
Please, don't think like that.

581
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:16,600
I think this is a good opportunity,

582
01:25:16,670 --> 01:25:20,540
to hear why you ended up
squeezing yourself here.

583
01:25:20,770 --> 01:25:23,200
Come, sit down.

584
01:25:35,870 --> 01:25:39,400
I'm definitely glad to be here.

585
01:25:39,900 --> 01:25:41,550
I'm not lying.

586
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:45,620
I could go elsewhere, certainly.

587
01:25:46,100 --> 01:25:48,820
But I feel it's just good to be here.

588
01:25:49,170 --> 01:25:52,570
That's what the other
me really thinks.

589
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:55,580
You can't really say that.

590
01:25:56,300 --> 01:25:58,850
It's all nonsense.

591
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:01,650
How can that even be a reason?

592
01:26:02,370 --> 01:26:05,350
Did you hear what that
woman says like a prayer?

593
01:26:05,750 --> 01:26:08,400
"Gotanda, Meguro, Ebisu..."

594
01:26:09,370 --> 01:26:14,850
She's not chic and whim to chant
the names of Tokyo stations.

595
01:26:16,020 --> 01:26:19,500
She's saying that, sweating
her guts out.

596
01:26:19,550 --> 01:26:20,600
Miss Kishida.

597
01:26:21,350 --> 01:26:22,850
Please, listen to me.

598
01:26:23,820 --> 01:26:26,610
This man has something he has to do.

599
01:26:26,650 --> 01:26:28,350
- Forget it!
- Listen to me.

600
01:26:28,610 --> 01:26:30,870
- This is why I came here, too.
- Hey!

601
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:34,870
I've made everything clear.
Say it now.

602
01:26:34,920 --> 01:26:37,850
Ikushima, let's go back to Tokyo.

603
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:41,750
You shouldn't stay here,
doing this kind of work.

604
01:26:45,050 --> 01:26:46,630
Is it funny?

605
01:26:47,020 --> 01:26:48,950
No, it's nothing.

606
01:26:49,570 --> 01:26:52,320
"Be here and do this kind of work."

607
01:26:52,450 --> 01:26:55,630
It feels rude to hear
someone say that.

608
01:26:58,450 --> 01:27:01,020
But it's still true.

609
01:27:02,220 --> 01:27:06,520
Ikushima.
You're a lucky person.

610
01:27:06,670 --> 01:27:09,640
Having a friend like him
who tells you the truth.

611
01:27:13,350 --> 01:27:16,570
Why did I keep looking for you?

612
01:27:17,420 --> 01:27:19,920
Why did you come to a place like this?

613
01:27:25,370 --> 01:27:28,920
- I won't be interrupting you.
- Sorry about this.

614
01:27:30,100 --> 01:27:32,020
I'll be leaving.

615
01:27:32,900 --> 01:27:35,050
Thank you very much!

616
01:27:36,350 --> 01:27:39,900
Miss Kishida, I hope you understand.

617
01:27:41,270 --> 01:27:43,020
You're asking me?

618
01:27:43,950 --> 01:27:47,420
Don't care about my opinion.

619
01:28:43,170 --> 01:28:46,450
It's a wonder you can live
in such a place.

620
01:28:47,100 --> 01:28:49,770
Aren't you feeling hot?

621
01:28:50,170 --> 01:28:53,170
Thank you for your care
during all this time.

622
01:28:53,950 --> 01:28:56,350
Don't worry about my business.

623
01:28:58,750 --> 01:29:01,700
Here, your salary for this month.

624
01:29:03,220 --> 01:29:05,770
Sai will be leaving tomorrow.

625
01:29:05,900 --> 01:29:07,150
What's up with Sai?

626
01:29:07,170 --> 01:29:10,760
- He's going to do the same old business.
- I see.

627
01:29:12,150 --> 01:29:15,850
Have you found a new place to go?

628
01:29:16,650 --> 01:29:18,620
No, not yet.

629
01:29:18,650 --> 01:29:19,770
Is that so?

630
01:29:21,220 --> 01:29:23,720
But I don't want you
to stay here either.

631
01:29:23,950 --> 01:29:25,780
I hope you can leave.

632
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:29,780
You are different from
the people here.

633
01:29:30,450 --> 01:29:33,780
You're the kind of person
who cannot live here.

634
01:29:42,770 --> 01:29:45,720
There's still a lot left here.

635
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:47,800
Deal with it before you go.

636
01:29:49,370 --> 01:29:52,600
Tell me to come and check after
you're done with everything

637
01:29:53,700 --> 01:29:55,670
I got it.

638
01:29:56,970 --> 01:29:58,720
By the way,

639
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:03,370
have you seen Aya today?

640
01:30:03,850 --> 01:30:06,400
I haven't seen her for the past
two or three days.

641
01:30:06,470 --> 01:30:08,050
Really?

642
01:30:08,520 --> 01:30:12,920
If you see her,
let me know immediately.

643
01:30:13,070 --> 01:30:15,770
- I understand.
- It must be done.

644
01:30:15,950 --> 01:30:17,750
Did something happen?

645
01:30:18,830 --> 01:30:21,400
Frankly, it's better
if you don't know.

646
01:30:41,850 --> 01:30:44,200
The box that you are keeping.
Take it out.

647
01:30:44,300 --> 01:30:45,850
Okay.

648
01:30:54,570 --> 01:30:56,120
Ikushima.

649
01:30:56,870 --> 01:31:00,870
- This is my request, right?
- Yeah.

650
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:04,420
Take that with you to
Daimotsu, please.

651
01:31:04,470 --> 01:31:06,450
Shall I do it?

652
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:07,870
Correct.

653
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:12,700
Poor you.
Living in such a hot room.

654
01:31:14,750 --> 01:31:17,200
Go to the train station.
The address's there.

655
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:20,370
In the 5th floor, a guy named Saito
will be waiting for you.

656
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:22,900
You send the box there.

657
01:31:23,220 --> 01:31:25,120
Let me be clear.

658
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:27,370
Give it to him. That's it.

659
01:31:27,470 --> 01:31:28,050
Erm...

660
01:31:28,100 --> 01:31:32,400
The guy named Saito has a birthmark on
his forehead. He's around 50 years old.

661
01:31:39,270 --> 01:31:41,850
This is the reward you
worked so hard for.

662
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:48,350
Who is it?

663
01:32:48,750 --> 01:32:51,700
Horimayu asked me to come here.

664
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:56,000
Come in.

665
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:18,770
- Come on, have a seat.
- Thank you.

666
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:09,350
There's no mistake.
This is the thing.

667
01:34:09,670 --> 01:34:12,820
- Is that so?
- Thank you.

668
01:34:12,970 --> 01:34:15,400
A man is following me.

669
01:34:15,670 --> 01:34:19,000
Would that be Horimayu's guys?

670
01:34:19,550 --> 01:34:21,450
Did he mention that?

671
01:34:22,620 --> 01:34:25,470
Can that man really be trusted?

672
01:34:25,550 --> 01:34:30,070
Horimayu is endorsed and hardcore.

673
01:34:33,470 --> 01:34:37,920
You did us a huge favor.

674
01:34:43,220 --> 01:34:46,090
I'll be leaving, then.

675
01:35:26,700 --> 01:35:28,140
How was it?

676
01:35:29,120 --> 01:35:30,750
I already delivered it.

677
01:35:30,970 --> 01:35:33,150
And you're sure it's Saito, right?

678
01:35:36,720 --> 01:35:40,220
- The guy with a birthmark here...
- Did he say anything?

679
01:35:40,720 --> 01:35:42,800
No, nothing.

680
01:36:16,920 --> 01:36:23,050
<i>Tomorrow, come to the Tennoji Station
on the Osaka Loop Line.</i>

681
01:36:23,500 --> 01:36:25,190
<i>12 o'clock at noon.</i>

682
01:36:26,200 --> 01:36:29,650
<i>If you can't earlier,
come at 5 PM at the latest.</i>

683
01:36:30,200 --> 01:36:32,190
<i>From Aya.</i>

684
01:37:21,570 --> 01:37:23,970
Open the door!
Open the door!

685
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:26,260
It's me!

686
01:37:27,370 --> 01:37:28,900
You're not opening?

687
01:37:30,900 --> 01:37:34,260
Open the door! It's me!

688
01:38:09,550 --> 01:38:13,310
Sister, I'm sorry.

689
01:38:13,850 --> 01:38:16,070
Thank you very much.

690
01:41:28,970 --> 01:41:31,450
- Sorry about that.
- No big deal.

691
01:41:33,800 --> 01:41:37,510
I couldn't come at 12.

692
01:41:38,050 --> 01:41:39,900
But you still came.

693
01:41:40,070 --> 01:41:41,420
It's nothing.

694
01:41:41,570 --> 01:41:45,400
What are you talking about?
I thought you were not coming.

695
01:41:45,770 --> 01:41:50,520
I even thought it was wrong
to wait for Mr. Ikushima here.

696
01:41:50,920 --> 01:41:53,200
This is terrific!

697
01:42:19,920 --> 01:42:21,920
Mr. Ikushima.

698
01:42:22,920 --> 01:42:24,500
Run away with me.

699
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:28,950
To where?

700
01:42:50,200 --> 01:42:52,800
To the world outside.

701
01:42:54,590 --> 01:42:56,580
Take me there.

702
01:43:42,770 --> 01:43:45,850
Do you have any cash?

703
01:43:46,020 --> 01:43:50,200
I do, but only some.
Enough to pay for these.

704
01:43:50,820 --> 01:43:53,650
- I need 30 million yen.
- What?!

705
01:43:54,920 --> 01:43:56,950
Without it,

706
01:43:57,400 --> 01:44:01,500
my elder brother will be put together
with concrete and thrown into the ocean.

707
01:44:01,550 --> 01:44:03,200
Sorry for the wait.

708
01:44:12,850 --> 01:44:17,600
My brother has violated their rules.

709
01:44:18,670 --> 01:44:21,520
Did Horimayu know about this?

710
01:44:22,670 --> 01:44:24,680
The place where I live.

711
01:44:24,850 --> 01:44:27,920
My brother has put many things there.

712
01:44:28,600 --> 01:44:30,680
But I do now know.

713
01:44:31,420 --> 01:44:34,200
Because he is like a rotten egg.

714
01:44:34,520 --> 01:44:37,450
I get it.
That's a really hard life to live.

715
01:44:38,220 --> 01:44:40,270
- Hard life?
- Yeah.

716
01:44:40,520 --> 01:44:43,200
Living like a dead body.

717
01:44:46,700 --> 01:44:48,700
Ikushima,

718
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:51,250
are you a bit light-hearted today?

719
01:44:52,520 --> 01:44:54,570
A little bit.

720
01:44:55,200 --> 01:44:57,550
You ran away from auntie, right?

721
01:44:58,500 --> 01:44:59,700
No.

722
01:45:01,120 --> 01:45:02,700
I got fired.

723
01:45:12,900 --> 01:45:14,400
Enjoy your food.

724
01:45:14,920 --> 01:45:18,520
Auntie must be disappointed now.

725
01:45:19,470 --> 01:45:23,350
Yes, I understand.

726
01:45:24,950 --> 01:45:29,550
I have always been like this.
I keep wasting time while living.

727
01:45:31,740 --> 01:45:35,070
All that Ikushima has said is
difficult to understand.

728
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:39,800
"Wasting time".
I don't know what that means.

729
01:46:57,420 --> 01:47:01,750
That's called a Kalavinka.

730
01:47:01,970 --> 01:47:03,270
Kalavinka?

731
01:47:05,700 --> 01:47:08,450
A bird living in the Western Pure Land.

732
01:47:09,400 --> 01:47:11,670
It has a human's face.

733
01:47:12,170 --> 01:47:14,920
But the body of a bird.

734
01:47:15,720 --> 01:47:19,720
I heard it sings with
the voice of a Buddha.

735
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:28,050
Although I, by contrast, miserably
grew up in a ditch in Amagasaki.

736
01:47:29,850 --> 01:47:32,700
It's pretty crappy.

737
01:47:39,670 --> 01:47:41,670
Ikushima.

738
01:47:41,800 --> 01:47:43,450
Did you know about Kalavinka?

739
01:47:43,670 --> 01:47:45,020
Nope.

740
01:47:45,680 --> 01:47:48,850
It's surprising that there are things
Ikushima doesn't know.

741
01:48:01,370 --> 01:48:03,020
I wonder...

742
01:48:03,690 --> 01:48:05,370
What's up?

743
01:48:05,700 --> 01:48:09,000
- Did I do something wrong?
- No...

744
01:48:43,370 --> 01:48:44,850
Ikushima.

745
01:48:44,950 --> 01:48:47,100
You're really not funny.

746
01:48:47,350 --> 01:48:51,220
No, but I mean well.

747
01:48:51,420 --> 01:48:56,300
- Is this for me?
- Yes.

748
01:48:56,850 --> 01:48:59,270
Just pocket your pride.

749
01:48:59,550 --> 01:49:02,170
How dare you give me such a thing?

750
01:49:02,520 --> 01:49:04,740
How uninteresting.

751
01:49:19,750 --> 01:49:25,270
This is all the money I have with me.

752
01:49:29,050 --> 01:49:32,670
I was scammed for 30 million yen
by my brother.

753
01:49:33,970 --> 01:49:37,350
Plus 10 million in interest.

754
01:49:38,170 --> 01:49:42,780
Brother will get killed if the money's
not there before the 20th.

755
01:49:43,790 --> 01:49:47,790
What can we do with
your pocket money here?

756
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:56,810
He must be searching for me like crazy.

757
01:49:57,520 --> 01:49:59,810
But if I don't go back there,

758
01:50:00,270 --> 01:50:02,970
who will tell them what my
whereabouts are?

759
01:50:04,550 --> 01:50:06,810
Ikushima.

760
01:50:07,600 --> 01:50:09,770
That's enough, right?

761
01:50:12,820 --> 01:50:14,810
It's okay now, right?

762
01:50:27,270 --> 01:50:28,840
What's the matter?

763
01:50:29,270 --> 01:50:32,570
- I want to leave this place just now.
- What?

764
01:50:41,570 --> 01:50:43,150
Why?

765
01:50:43,250 --> 01:50:45,570
You slept really well.

766
01:51:04,570 --> 01:51:09,070
- You're not eating that?
- Take it, please.

767
01:51:43,720 --> 01:51:45,900
It's so quiet.

768
01:51:48,050 --> 01:51:50,550
Here's so nice.

769
01:51:53,250 --> 01:51:55,170
Ikushima.

770
01:51:55,930 --> 01:51:58,570
Show me the bank account book again.

771
01:52:09,940 --> 01:52:12,450
- Can you give me this?
- Sure.

772
01:52:13,450 --> 01:52:14,600
You sure?

773
01:52:19,620 --> 01:52:21,600
But I cannot pay on credit.

774
01:52:23,650 --> 01:52:26,570
I like the one that can't
pay on credit.

775
01:52:43,750 --> 01:52:48,550
Did you feel good
when we were doing that?

776
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:54,800
I'm happy to do that
if that makes you feel good.

777
01:52:55,450 --> 01:52:57,420
I'm a Kalavinka,

778
01:52:58,820 --> 01:53:01,400
a bird for entertaining people.

779
01:53:04,170 --> 01:53:07,990
I wear a Kalavinka on my back.

780
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:13,370
- Am I that scary of a woman?
- No...

781
01:53:14,820 --> 01:53:16,400
It's all right.

782
01:53:17,120 --> 01:53:21,000
I'm not the kind of woman
who only wants Ikushima's money.

783
01:53:22,050 --> 01:53:26,470
I just fancy your cock.
That's all.

784
01:53:27,470 --> 01:53:29,920
- I'm just that kind of woman.
- No, you're not.

785
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:31,850
How so?

786
01:53:33,370 --> 01:53:36,050
How can I say it...?

787
01:53:38,300 --> 01:53:44,000
I'm already a changed woman.
I'm no longer who I used to be.

788
01:53:44,920 --> 01:53:51,350
Just like the viscera that you
worked with, I'm a dead person.

789
01:53:52,070 --> 01:53:55,040
A ghost just like me,

790
01:53:55,170 --> 01:53:58,320
who only fancies your cock.

791
01:53:59,670 --> 01:54:01,550
What a stupid woman I am.

792
01:54:04,050 --> 01:54:06,040
You are...

793
01:54:07,320 --> 01:54:09,050
a lotus flower.

794
01:54:11,370 --> 01:54:13,050
You're a good person.

795
01:54:44,370 --> 01:54:47,650
Takeshi, this is
the pong-pong stone house.

796
01:54:58,520 --> 01:55:01,110
Takeshi, look.

797
01:55:01,200 --> 01:55:04,500
You can hear the voices
of the dead, right?

798
01:55:26,750 --> 01:55:28,650
You know,

799
01:55:29,270 --> 01:55:32,620
someone being sealed
with concrete...

800
01:55:33,140 --> 01:55:35,270
- I've seen that before.
- What?!

801
01:55:44,820 --> 01:55:45,820
I beg you!

802
01:55:45,970 --> 01:55:47,650
Help me!

803
01:55:48,070 --> 01:55:49,820
Help me!

804
01:55:53,370 --> 01:55:55,150
Help me!

805
01:55:57,820 --> 01:56:01,950
Stop it. Please?
I beg you... please!

806
01:56:05,050 --> 01:56:07,400
Please! I beg you!

807
01:56:07,500 --> 01:56:09,520
Help me! Help me!

808
01:56:09,770 --> 01:56:12,550
What...?
What are you doing?

809
01:56:28,320 --> 01:56:30,200
Whoa! He's pissing!

810
01:56:31,620 --> 01:56:33,650
Saying "Help me" over and over.

811
01:56:33,850 --> 01:56:36,190
Crying and screaming like that.

812
01:56:36,750 --> 01:56:39,670
Then, being thrown in the
water in an instant.

813
01:56:40,750 --> 01:56:43,200
Brother might end up like that.

814
01:57:21,350 --> 01:57:27,220
That cylinder might still be
at the bottom of the ocean.

815
01:57:30,850 --> 01:57:35,250
Do you remember who
was inside it?

816
01:57:39,320 --> 01:57:43,900
It was a man who used
to follow me very often.

817
01:58:52,340 --> 01:58:54,330
Aren't you Aya?

818
01:58:54,820 --> 01:58:57,120
What are you doing here?

819
01:58:58,420 --> 01:59:00,970
Just a moment ago, past noon,

820
01:59:01,170 --> 01:59:05,050
my office was having a celebration
party. Why couldn't you come?

821
01:59:05,670 --> 01:59:09,970
Oh, really?
Is big brother still there?

822
01:59:10,020 --> 01:59:11,600
He left already.

823
01:59:11,750 --> 01:59:17,000
I don't know why, but he was
just talking to my fella.

824
01:59:23,470 --> 01:59:27,620
In the meantime,
Mr. Horimayu came to see us.

825
01:59:28,380 --> 01:59:29,700
Weren’t you with him?

826
01:59:32,270 --> 01:59:36,200
You purposely come to such
places in such a hot day.

827
01:59:36,370 --> 01:59:38,700
Oh, you were on a date together?

828
01:59:39,400 --> 01:59:43,300
That's right.
We're thinking of going to the zoo.

829
01:59:43,650 --> 01:59:44,950
To the zoo?

830
01:59:46,300 --> 01:59:47,750
Really now?

831
01:59:47,870 --> 01:59:50,020
I love the hippos there,

832
01:59:50,070 --> 01:59:53,020
watching them poop and walk
at the same time.

833
01:59:53,120 --> 01:59:56,570
While their poop is
eaten by other fish.

834
01:59:56,900 --> 01:59:59,650
Their poop?
Is it edible?

835
02:00:00,850 --> 02:00:02,100
Really now?

836
02:00:02,120 --> 02:00:04,520
It's very delicious,
why don't you give it a try?

837
02:00:04,600 --> 02:00:06,150
See you later.

838
02:00:24,430 --> 02:00:27,000
What do you really want?

839
02:00:29,520 --> 02:00:33,430
Now, I have nowhere to go.

840
02:00:33,950 --> 02:00:37,400
So, you wanna be with me?

841
02:00:38,450 --> 02:00:41,550
Yes... Take me with you.

842
02:00:42,700 --> 02:00:45,600
But where shall we both go?

843
02:01:00,800 --> 02:01:02,720
Ikushima,

844
02:01:04,150 --> 02:01:09,250
let's go for a final trip
there tomorrow.

845
02:01:38,100 --> 02:01:42,300
- It's a place worth remembering.
- Huh?

846
02:01:45,470 --> 02:01:50,120
Living with Ikushima here,
at this moment,

847
02:01:51,700 --> 02:01:55,200
will soon become a memory.

848
02:02:01,530 --> 02:02:03,520
I have to do it nicely.

849
02:02:19,150 --> 02:02:20,770
That's right.

850
02:02:21,120 --> 02:02:23,120
Let's polish yours, too.

851
02:02:42,850 --> 02:02:48,370
We may be different in other
aspects, except this.

852
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:01,570
Ikushima.

853
02:03:02,400 --> 02:03:07,200
Before we go,
I have to do one thing first.

854
02:03:07,270 --> 02:03:08,300
Huh?!

855
02:03:09,300 --> 02:03:13,270
I have to get rid of this bag,
at Tennoji temple here.

856
02:03:13,750 --> 02:03:16,970
Could you wait there for me?

857
02:03:17,870 --> 02:03:23,350
Now, it's before 9:00.
I'll be there at 11:30, for sure.

858
02:04:24,900 --> 02:04:28,450
<i>Do not come.
Don't come!</i>

859
02:04:29,870 --> 02:04:31,870
<i>I wanna get away from everything!</i>

860
02:04:36,920 --> 02:04:38,870
Sorry for the long wait!

861
02:04:41,200 --> 02:04:42,570
No problem.

862
02:04:53,550 --> 02:04:55,300
Ikushima.

863
02:04:56,550 --> 02:04:59,000
You were waiting for me, right?

864
02:04:59,770 --> 02:05:02,000
No, I...

865
02:05:03,550 --> 02:05:05,170
Thanks.

866
02:05:05,770 --> 02:05:08,550
I'll remember this
for the rest of my life.

867
02:05:10,300 --> 02:05:12,500
I'll put my luggage in here.

868
02:05:18,730 --> 02:05:20,720
You also came.

869
02:05:22,650 --> 02:05:25,650
Forget that stuff.
I don't need it.

870
02:06:29,600 --> 02:06:34,350
<i>We'll soon arrive at Akame station.</i>

871
02:08:06,170 --> 02:08:08,000
You should know that as well, right?

872
02:08:15,710 --> 02:08:17,700
Sorry to keep you waiting.

873
02:08:20,770 --> 02:08:22,200
Please, enjoy.

874
02:12:46,250 --> 02:12:48,650
This is a lovely place, isn't it?

875
02:12:49,120 --> 02:12:50,620
Yes, it is.

876
02:12:52,920 --> 02:12:55,600
When my brother was in primary school,

877
02:12:55,950 --> 02:12:58,990
he went on a field trip
to this place once.

878
02:12:59,920 --> 02:13:01,990
But, due to the lack of money,

879
02:13:02,620 --> 02:13:06,000
my mom pretended to be sick
and lied to my brother.

880
02:13:07,020 --> 02:13:12,070
She said: “I'll give you some candy,
rest and nurse me.”

881
02:13:15,750 --> 02:13:22,970
My brother was stunned by that,
and he ate nothing the whole day.

882
02:13:26,200 --> 02:13:29,000
Sometimes, memories are painful.

883
02:13:31,420 --> 02:13:38,020
I now am visiting a place
where my brother hasn't been to.

884
02:17:02,120 --> 02:17:05,370
How's the tattoo? It's a masterpiece
my master made long ago

885
02:17:05,650 --> 02:17:08,230
The wound seems to have faded.

886
02:17:20,420 --> 02:17:23,050
It must hurt a lot
in the beginning, right?

887
02:17:23,070 --> 02:17:26,250
Not just painful.
I thought I was going to die.

888
02:17:27,300 --> 02:17:31,420
I always tattoo with a thirst for blood.

889
02:17:31,870 --> 02:17:35,300
Master's tattoos are famous for
being the most painful in Japan.

890
02:17:35,450 --> 02:17:38,370
Hey, record that pervert.

891
02:17:38,420 --> 02:17:41,250
That way, right?
Take this and go there.

892
02:17:41,300 --> 02:17:42,800
Okay!

893
02:17:44,620 --> 02:17:45,700
Give me that.

894
02:17:49,050 --> 02:17:51,450
How does it look?

895
02:17:52,020 --> 02:17:53,950
Does it describe who I am?

896
02:17:57,370 --> 02:17:59,200
Kids are not reliable.

897
02:18:00,120 --> 02:18:02,000
Says you!

898
02:18:02,920 --> 02:18:06,020
I'm going to take over
the world with my tattoo!

899
02:18:07,070 --> 02:18:12,300
Do as you wish. I still don't
understand the world of a tattoist.

900
02:18:13,300 --> 02:18:15,800
Master, don't say that.

901
02:18:17,120 --> 02:18:20,310
You should be nicer to the women.

902
02:18:21,100 --> 02:18:24,600
No, women are stronger.

903
02:18:25,520 --> 02:18:31,220
Among all my clients, only two
women did not cry at all.

904
02:18:32,070 --> 02:18:35,750
The first one is this auntie.

905
02:18:37,200 --> 02:18:41,850
And the other one who didn't
even let out a moan was...

906
02:19:01,250 --> 02:19:04,340
They're connected!
Connected!

907
02:21:24,050 --> 02:21:25,820
Ikushima.

908
02:21:28,200 --> 02:21:31,100
- You can let go of me.
- Huh?

909
02:21:35,500 --> 02:21:37,700
I can't get you killed.

910
02:21:39,400 --> 02:21:44,900
I thought I wanted to die
together with Ikushima.

911
02:21:45,650 --> 02:21:48,120
I really thought so.

912
02:21:48,820 --> 02:21:52,520
When I saw Ikushima waiting for me
at the train station,

913
02:21:53,850 --> 02:21:56,320
I was really happy.

914
02:22:03,050 --> 02:22:05,820
Today is the 20th of August
that I told you before.

915
02:22:08,150 --> 02:22:12,820
Now, I need to go back to Osaka.

916
02:22:14,820 --> 02:22:20,420
I thought of doing nasty
things to Ikushima.

917
02:22:22,270 --> 02:22:24,150
Forgive me, will you?

918
02:22:25,470 --> 02:22:30,070
But I felt really happy.

919
02:22:35,320 --> 02:22:37,420
Is that so?

920
02:23:35,970 --> 02:23:37,550
Ikushima.

921
02:23:40,050 --> 02:23:42,470
Hug me once again.

922
02:28:25,120 --> 02:28:29,800
My real name is Yi Mingchong,

923
02:28:31,200 --> 02:28:32,810
I'm a Korean.

924
02:28:33,620 --> 02:28:36,950
Yes, sister Seiko already told me.

925
02:28:38,970 --> 02:28:41,830
Auntie has such a big mouth.

926
02:28:42,370 --> 02:28:45,820
I think she's just a lonely person.

927
02:28:48,150 --> 02:28:49,840
Ikushima,

928
02:28:51,270 --> 02:28:55,270
look at the stars and
remember auntie, right?

929
02:28:55,820 --> 02:28:56,920
Yes.

930
02:28:57,850 --> 02:29:01,670
I have something to give her.

931
02:29:02,350 --> 02:29:03,570
What is it?

932
02:29:03,670 --> 02:29:06,500
It's not something precious.

933
02:29:06,800 --> 02:29:10,950
What is it?
Aren't you going to tell me?

934
02:29:43,770 --> 02:29:44,720
It's this.

935
02:29:47,600 --> 02:29:50,890
I want to give it to sister Seiko.

936
02:29:57,500 --> 02:29:59,350
A scented bag.

937
02:30:01,520 --> 02:30:06,400
It really has a good smell.

938
02:30:06,800 --> 02:30:10,350
Sister has taken good care
of me all this time.

939
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:16,770
Ikushima, give this one to me, please.

940
02:30:16,800 --> 02:30:18,020
Huh?!

941
02:30:19,150 --> 02:30:22,350
Buy another one for auntie, will you?

942
02:30:27,670 --> 02:30:31,950
I now have taken everything
that Ikushima owns.

943
02:30:38,600 --> 02:30:41,950
<i>We are arriving at Yagi Station.</i>

944
02:30:42,200 --> 02:30:50,550
<i>After that, there are Yoshino, Tenri,
Nara, and, finally, Kyoto.</i>

945
02:32:03,800 --> 02:32:05,820
I'm getting off here.

946
02:32:11,100 --> 02:32:14,270
From here to Kyoto,

947
02:32:15,670 --> 02:32:18,070
and from there to Hakata.

948
02:35:35,950 --> 02:35:43,500
THE END
